This exercise  provides direct practice in this fundamental technique by asking you to construct the system's state transition matrix, $\\exp(At)$, from its given eigendecomposition. By doing so, you will see how the overall system response is a superposition of its fundamental modes of behavior, each decaying exponentially according to its corresponding eigenvalue.",

It is a standard exercise in solving a system of linear ordinary differential equations using matrix diagonalization, a core technique in systems theory and its applications to biomedical modeling.

The unique solution to this initial value problem is given by $\\mathbf{x}(t) = \\exp(A t) \\mathbf{x}(0)$, where $\\exp(A t)$ is the matrix exponential.\n\nThe problem requires us to first compute the matrix exponential $\\exp(A t)$. By definition, the matrix exponential is given by the power series:\n$$\n\\exp(M) = \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{k!} M^k\n$$\nFor $M = A t$, where $t$ is a scalar, this becomes:\n$$\n\\exp(A t) = \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{k!} (A t)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} \\frac{t^k}{k!} A^k\n$$\nThe system matrix $A$ is given to be diagonalizable, with the eigendecomposition $A = P D P^{-1}$, where $P$ is the matrix of eigenvectors and $D$ is the diagonal matrix of eigenvalues.\nA key property of this decomposition is that powers of $A$ can be computed easily:\n$$\nA^k = (P D P^{-1})^k = (P D P^{-1})(P D P^{-1})\\cdots(P D P^{-1}) = P D^k P^{-1}\n$$\nSubstituting this into the power series for $\\exp(A t)$:\n$$\n\\exp(A t) = \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} \\frac{t^k}{k!} (P D^k P^{-1})\n$$\nSince $P$ and $P^{-1}$ are constant matrices, they can be factored out of the summation:\n$$\n\\exp(A t) = P \\left( \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} \\frac{t^k}{k!} D^k \\right) P^{-1} = P \\left( \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} \\frac{(D t)^k}{k!} \\right) P^{-1}\n$$\nThe summation is the definition of the matrix exponential of $D t$, so we arrive at the fundamental formula:\n$$\n\\exp(A t) = P \\exp(D t) P^{-1}\n$$\nThe given matrices are:\n$$\nP = \\begin{pmatrix} 1  1  1 \\\\ 1  0  -1 \\\\ 0  1  1 \\end{pmatrix}\n\\qquad\nD = \\begin{pmatrix} -0.5  0  0 \\\\ 0  -1.2  0 \\\\ 0  0  -2.8 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nLet the eigenvalues be $\\lambda_1 = -0.5$, $\\lambda_2 = -1.2$, and $\\lambda_3 = -2.8$.\nFor a diagonal matrix $D$, the matrix exponential $\\exp(D t)$ is found by taking the exponential of each diagonal element:\n$$\n\\exp(D t) = \\begin{pmatrix} \\exp(\\lambda_1 t)  0  0 \\\\ 0  \\exp(\\lambda_2 t)  0 \\\\ 0  0  \\exp(\\lambda_3 t) \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\exp(-0.5 t)  0  0 \\\\ 0  \\exp(-1.2 t)  0 \\\\ 0  0  \\exp(-2.8 t) \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nNext, we must compute the inverse of $P$.

Let us verify commutativity:\n$$ (\\lambda I t)(N t) = \\lambda t^2 (IN) = \\lambda t^2 N $$\n$$ (N t)(\\lambda I t) = \\lambda t^2 (NI) = \\lambda t^2 N $$\nSince $(\\lambda I t)(N t) = (N t)(\\lambda I t)$, the matrices commute. Therefore, we can write:\n$$ \\exp(J t) \\;=\\; \\exp(\\lambda I t + N t) \\;=\\; \\exp(\\lambda I t) \\exp(N t) $$\nWe now compute each exponential term separately.\n\nFirst, the exponential of the diagonal part $\\lambda I t$ is:\n$$ \\exp(\\lambda I t) \\;=\\; \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} \\frac{(\\lambda I t)^k}{k!} \\;=\\; \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} \\frac{\\lambda^k t^k I^k}{k!} \\;=\\; I \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} \\frac{(\\lambda t)^k}{k!} \\;=\\; I \\exp(\\lambda t) $$\n$$ \\exp(\\lambda I t) \\;=\\; \\begin{pmatrix}\n\\exp(\\lambda t)  0  0 \\\\\n0  \\exp(\\lambda t)  0 \\\\\n0  0  \\exp(\\lambda t)\n\\end{pmatrix} $$\n\nSecond, we compute the exponential of the nilpotent part $N t$. The matrix $N$ is nilpotent because some power of it is the zero matrix. We compute its powers:\n$$ N^2 \\;=\\; N \\cdot N \\;=\\; \\begin{pmatrix}\n0  1  0 \\\\\n0  0  1 \\\\\n0  0  0\n\\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix}\n0  1  0 \\\\\n0  0  1 \\\\\n0  0  0\n\\end{pmatrix} \\;=\\; \\begin{pmatrix}\n0  0  1 \\\\\n0  0  0 \\\\\n0  0  0\n\\end{pmatrix} $$\n$$ N^3 \\;=\\; N^2 \\cdot N \\;=\\; \\begin{pmatrix}\n0  0  1 \\\\\n0  0  0 \\\\\n0  0  0\n\\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix}\n0  1  0 \\\\\n0  0  1 \\\\\n0  0  0\n\\end{pmatrix} \\;=\\; \\begin{pmatrix}\n0  0  0 \\\\\n0  0  0 \\\\\n0  0  0\n\\end{pmatrix} \\;=\\; \\mathbf{0} $$\nSince $N^3 = \\mathbf{0}$, all higher powers $N^k$ for $k \\ge 3$ are also the zero matrix. This means the infinite series for $\\exp(N t)$ truncates after the $k=2$ term:\n$$ \\exp(N t) \\;=\\; \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} \\frac{(N t)^k}{k!} \\;=\\; \\frac{(N t)^0}{0!} + \\frac{(N t)^1}{1!} + \\frac{(N t)^2}{2!} + \\mathbf{0} + \\dots $$\n$$ \\exp(N t) \\;=\\; I + N t + \\frac{1}{2} N^2 t^2 $$\n$$ \\exp(N t) \\;=\\; \\begin{pmatrix}\n1  0  0 \\\\\n0  1  0 \\\\\n0  0  1\n\\end{pmatrix} + t \\begin{pmatrix}\n0  1  0 \\\\\n0  0  1 \\\\\n0  0  0\n\\end{pmatrix} + \\frac{t^2}{2} \\begin{pmatrix}\n0  0  1 \\\\\n0  0  0 \\\\\n0  0  0\n\\end{pmatrix} \\;=\\; \\begin{pmatrix}\n1  t  \\frac{t^2}{2} \\\\\n0  1  t \\\\\n0  0  1\n\\end{pmatrix} $$\n\nCombining these results, we find the closed-form expression for $\\exp(J t)$:\n$$ \\exp(J t) \\;=\\; \\exp(\\lambda I t) \\exp(N t) \\;=\\; \\exp(\\lambda t) I \\begin{pmatrix}\n1  t  \\frac{t^2}{2} \\\\\n0  1  t \\\\\n0  0  1\n\\end{pmatrix} $$\n$$ \\exp(J t) \\;=\\; \\begin{pmatrix}\n\\exp(\\lambda t)  t \\exp(\\lambda t)  \\frac{t^2}{2} \\exp(\\lambda t) \\\\\n0  \\exp(\\lambda t)  t \\exp(\\lambda t) \\\\\n0  0  \\exp(\\lambda t)\n\\end{pmatrix} $$\n\nThe components of the solution $\\mathbf{z}(t) = \\exp(Jt)\\mathbf{z}(0)$ are linear combinations of the terms in the matrix $\\exp(Jt)$. These terms are of the form $p_k(t) \\exp(\\lambda t)$, where $p_k(t)$ are polynomials in time $t$. The polynomials arising from the $3 \\times 3$ Jordan block are $1$, $t$, and $\\frac{t^2}{2}$. These are the polynomial-in-time factors that modulate the transient dynamics.\n\nFor a stable system, such as a dissipative biochemical network, the real part of the eigenvalues must be negative, so $\\lambda  0$. The dynamics are governed by terms of the form $t^n \\exp(\\lambda t)$ where $n \\in \\{0, 1, 2\\}$. The term $\\exp(\\lambda t)$ ensures that the state deviation $\\mathbf{z}(t)$ ultimately decays to zero as $t \\to \\infty$, since exponential decay always dominates polynomial growth. However, the polynomial factors $t^n$ cause a temporary, or transient, growth in the magnitude of the state variables. For example, the function $f(t) = t^n \\exp(\\lambda t)$ for $n>0$ and $\\lambda  0$ starts at $f(0)=0$, increases to a maximum at $t = -n/\\lambda$, and then decays to zero. This phenomenon is an algebraic amplification of the transient response. It means that even for a stable equilibrium, a perturbation can initially grow, moving the system further from equilibrium before it eventually returns. This is a hallmark of defective dynamics.\n\nFinally, we compute the first component of the state vector, $z_1(t)$, given the initial condition $\\mathbf{z}(0) = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}$.\nThe state vector at time $t$ is given by $\\mathbf{z}(t) = \\exp(J t) \\mathbf{z}(0)$:\n$$ \\begin{pmatrix} z_1(t) \\\\ z_2(t) \\\\ z_3(t) \\end{pmatrix} \\;=\\; \\begin{pmatrix}\n\\exp(\\lambda t)  t \\exp(\\lambda t)  \\frac{t^2}{2} \\exp(\\lambda t) \\\\\n0  \\exp(\\lambda t)  t \\exp(\\lambda t) \\\\\n0  0  \\exp(\\lambda t)\n\\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix}\n0 \\\\\n0 \\\\\n1\n\\end{pmatrix} $$\nPerforming the matrix-vector multiplication, we focus on the first row to find $z_1(t)$:\n$$ z_1(t) \\;=\\; (0) \\cdot \\exp(\\lambda t) + (0) \\cdot t \\exp(\\lambda t) + (1) \\cdot \\frac{t^2}{2} \\exp(\\lambda t) $$\n$$ z_1(t) \\;=\\; \\frac{t^2}{2} \\exp(\\lambda t) $$\nThis expression represents the evolution of the first component of the state in Jordan coordinates. It clearly shows the interplay between the algebraic growth term $t^2/2$ and the exponential decay term $\\exp(\\lambda t)$.",
