It is a standard exercise in solving a system of linear ordinary differential equations using matrix diagonalization, a core technique in systems theory and its applications to biomedical modeling. All necessary data are provided and are consistent.

The unique solution to this initial value problem is given by $x(t) = \\exp(A t) x(0)$, where $\\exp(A t)$ is the matrix exponential.\n\nThe problem requires us to first compute the matrix exponential $\\exp(A t)$. By definition, the matrix exponential is given by the power series:\n$$\n\\exp(M) = \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{k!} M^k\n$$\nFor $M = A t$, where $t$ is a scalar, this becomes:\n$$\n\\exp(A t) = \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} \\frac{t^k}{k!} A^k\n$$\nThe system matrix $A$ is given to be diagonalizable, with the eigendecomposition $A = P D P^{-1}$, where $P$ is the matrix of eigenvectors and $D$ is the diagonal matrix of eigenvalues.\nA key property of this decomposition is that powers of $A$ can be computed easily:\n$$\nA^k = (P D P^{-1})^k = (P D P^{-1})(P D P^{-1})\\cdots(P D P^{-1}) = P D^k P^{-1}\n$$\nSubstituting this into the power series for $\\exp(A t)$:\n$$\n\\exp(A t) = \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} \\frac{t^k}{k!} (P D^k P^{-1})\n$$\nSince $P$ and $P^{-1}$ are constant matrices, they can be factored out of the summation:\n$$\n\\exp(A t) = P \\left( \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} \\frac{t^k}{k!} D^k \\right) P^{-1} = P \\left( \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} \\frac{(D t)^k}{k!} \\right) P^{-1}\n$$\nThe summation is the definition of the matrix exponential of $D t$, so we arrive at the fundamental formula:\n$$\n\\exp(A t) = P \\exp(D t) P^{-1}\n$$\nThe given matrices are:\n$$\nP = \\begin{pmatrix} 1  1  1 \\\\ 1  0  -1 \\\\ 0  1  1 \\end{pmatrix}\n\\qquad\nD = \\begin{pmatrix} -0.5  0  0 \\\\ 0  -1.2  0 \\\\ 0  0  -2.8 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nLet the eigenvalues be $\\lambda_1 = -0.5$, $\\lambda_2 = -1.2$, and $\\lambda_3 = -2.8$.\nFor a diagonal matrix $D$, the matrix exponential $\\exp(D t)$ is found by taking the exponential of each diagonal element:\n$$\n\\exp(D t) = \\begin{pmatrix} \\exp(\\lambda_1 t)  0  0 \\\\ 0  \\exp(\\lambda_2 t)  0 \\\\ 0  0  \\exp(\\lambda_3 t) \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\exp(-0.5 t)  0  0 \\\\ 0  \\exp(-1.2 t)  0 \\\\ 0  0  \\exp(-2.8 t) \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nNext, we must compute the inverse of $P$.

It contains no discernible flaws. Therefore, the problem is deemed **valid**, and a full solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe solution to the linear system $\\dot{x}(t) = A x(t)$ can be expressed using the spectral decomposition of the matrix $A$. If $A$ is diagonalizable, it has a set of eigenvalues $\\lambda_k$ and corresponding eigenvectors $v_k$ that satisfy $A v_k = \\lambda_k v_k$. The general solution is a linear combination of the eigenmodes:\n$$\nx(t) = \\sum_{k=1}^{n} c_k \\exp(\\lambda_k t) v_k\n$$\nwhere the coefficients $c_k$ are determined by the initial condition $x(0) = \\sum_{k=1}^{n} c_k v_k$.\n\nFor a real $2 \\times 2$ matrix $A$ with a complex-conjugate pair of eigenvalues $\\lambda_1 = \\alpha + i\\omega$ and $\\lambda_2 = \\alpha - i\\omega$ (with $\\omega \\neq 0$), the corresponding eigenvectors must also be a complex-conjugate pair. Let them be $v_1$ and $v_2 = \\bar{v}_1$. The solution is then:\n$$\nx(t) = c_1 \\exp(\\lambda_1 t) v_1 + c_2 \\exp(\\lambda_2 t) v_2\n$$\nSince the state vector $x(t)$ must be real for all time $t$, we must have $c_2 = \\bar{c}_1$. Thus, the solution can be written as:\n$$\nx(t) = c_1 \\exp(\\lambda_1 t) v_1 + \\bar{c}_1 \\exp(\\bar{\\lambda}_1 t) \\bar{v}_1 = 2 \\text{Re} \\{ c_1 \\exp(\\lambda_1 t) v_1 \\}\n$$\nSubstituting $\\lambda_1 = \\alpha + i\\omega$:\n$$\nx(t) = 2 \\text{Re} \\{ c_1 v_1 \\exp((\\alpha+i\\omega)t) \\} = 2 \\exp(\\alpha t) \\text{Re} \\{ c_1 v_1 \\exp(i\\omega t) \\}\n$$\nLet the complex vector $c_1 v_1$ be denoted as $Z = R + iI$, where $R$ and $I$ are real vectors. The solution becomes:\n$$\nx(t) = 2 \\exp(\\alpha t) \\text{Re} \\{ (R+iI)(\\cos(\\omega t) + i\\sin(\\omega t)) \\} = 2 \\exp(\\alpha t) [R \\cos(\\omega t) - I \\sin(\\omega t)]\n$$\nThis demonstrates that the solution's components are sinusoids with frequency $\\omega$, modulated by an exponential envelope $\\exp(\\alpha t)$.\n\nNow, we specialize to the given system:\n$$\nA = \\begin{pmatrix} -\\beta  -\\omega \\\\ \\omega  -\\beta \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nFirst, we find the eigenvalues of $A$ by solving $\\det(A - \\lambda I) = 0$:\n$$\n\\det\\begin{pmatrix} -\\beta - \\lambda  -\\omega \\\\ \\omega  -\\beta - \\lambda \\end{pmatrix} = (-\\beta - \\lambda)^2 + \\omega^2 = 0\n$$\n$$\n(\\lambda + \\beta)^2 = - \\omega^2 \\implies \\lambda + \\beta = \\pm i\\omega \\implies \\lambda = -\\beta \\pm i\\omega\n$$\nThis confirms the general form with $\\alpha = -\\beta$. We choose $\\lambda_1 = -\\beta + i\\omega$ and $\\lambda_2 = -\\beta - i\\omega$.\n\nNext, we find the corresponding eigenvectors. For $\\lambda_1 = -\\beta + i\\omega$:\n$$\n(A-\\lambda_1 I) v_1 = \\begin{pmatrix} -i\\omega  -\\omega \\\\ \\omega  -i\\omega \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} (v_1)_1 \\\\ (v_1)_2 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe first row gives $-i\\omega (v_1)_1 - \\omega (v_1)_2 = 0$, which simplifies to $(v_1)_2 = -i (v_1)_1$. We can choose $(v_1)_1 = 1$, which gives an eigenvector $v_1 = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ -i \\end{pmatrix}$. The other eigenvector is $v_2 = \\bar{v}_1 = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ i \\end{pmatrix}$.\n\nThe initial condition $x(0)$ is decomposed in this eigenbasis:\n$$\nx(0) = \\begin{pmatrix} 0.8 \\\\ -0.6 \\end{pmatrix} = c_1 v_1 + c_2 v_2 = c_1 \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ -i \\end{pmatrix} + c_2 \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ i \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} c_1 + c_2 \\\\ -ic_1 + ic_2 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThis yields the system of equations:\n$1$. $c_1 + c_2 = 0.8$\n$2$. $-ic_1 + ic_2 = -0.6 \\implies i(c_2 - c_1) = -0.6 \\implies c_2 - c_1 = -0.6/i = 0.6i$\n\nAdding the two equations gives: $2c_2 = 0.8 + 0.6i \\implies c_2 = 0.4 + 0.3i$.\nSubtracting the second from the first gives: $2c_1 = 0.8 - 0.6i \\implies c_1 = 0.4 - 0.3i$.\nAs required for a real solution, $c_1$ and $c_2$ are complex conjugates ($c_1 = \\bar{c_2}$).\n\nThe solution for the first state, $x_1(t)$, is given by:\n$x_1(t) = c_1 (v_1)_1 \\exp(\\lambda_1 t) + c_2 (v_2)_1 \\exp(\\lambda_2 t)$\nSince $(v_1)_1 = 1$ and $(v_2)_1 = 1$:\n$x_1(t) = (0.4-0.3i)\\exp((-\\beta+i\\omega)t) + (0.4+0.3i)\\exp((-\\beta-i\\omega)t)$\n$x_1(t) = \\exp(-\\beta t) \\left[ (0.4-0.3i)\\exp(i\\omega t) + (0.4+0.3i)\\exp(-i\\omega t) \\right]$\nThis simplifies to $2 \\text{Re}\\{ (0.4-0.3i)\\exp(i\\omega t) \\}$:\n$x_1(t) = \\exp(-\\beta t) \\left[ 2 \\text{Re}\\{ (0.4-0.3i)(\\cos(\\omega t)+i\\sin(\\omega t)) \\} \\right]$\n$x_1(t) = \\exp(-\\beta t) \\left[ 2(0.4\\cos(\\omega t) + 0.3\\sin(\\omega t)) \\right]$\n$x_1(t) = \\exp(-\\beta t)(0.8\\cos(\\omega t) + 0.6\\sin(\\omega t))$\n\nTo find the amplitude, we combine the sinusoidal terms into the form $R\\cos(\\omega t - \\phi)$. The amplitude $R$ is given by:\n$R = \\sqrt{(0.8)^2 + (0.6)^2} = \\sqrt{0.64 + 0.36} = \\sqrt{1} = 1$.\nThus, the full expression for $x_1(t)$ is $x_1(t) = (1) \\cdot \\exp(-\\beta t) \\cos(\\omega t - \\phi)$.\nThe amplitude envelope of $x_1(t)$ is the function $E(t) = (1) \\cdot \\exp(-\\beta t) = \\exp(-\\beta t)$.\n\nThe problem asks for the value of this envelope at time $T = 0.4 \\text{ s}$.\nThe parameters are $\\beta = 0.15 \\text{ s}^{-1}$ and $T = 0.4 \\text{ s}$.\n$$\nE(T) = \\exp(-\\beta T) = \\exp(-0.15 \\times 0.4) = \\exp(-0.06)\n$$\nNow, we calculate the numerical value and round to five significant figures.\n$$\n\\exp(-0.06) \\approx 0.94176453...\n$$\nRounding to five significant figures gives $0.94176$.\nThe quantity is dimensionless as requested, since the product $\\beta T$ has units of $(\\text{s}^{-1})(\\text{s})$, which is dimensionless.",

Therefore, we can write:\n$$ \\exp(J t) \\;=\\; \\exp(\\lambda I t + N t) \\;=\\; \\exp(\\lambda I t) \\exp(N t) $$\nWe now compute each exponential term separately.\n\nFirst, the exponential of the diagonal part $\\lambda I t$ is:\n$$ \\exp(\\lambda I t) \\;=\\; \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} \\frac{(\\lambda I t)^k}{k!} \\;=\\; \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} \\frac{\\lambda^k t^k I^k}{k!} \\;=\\; I \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} \\frac{(\\lambda t)^k}{k!} \\;=\\; I \\exp(\\lambda t) $$\n$$ \\exp(\\lambda I t) \\;=\\; \\begin{pmatrix}\n\\exp(\\lambda t)  0  0 \\\\\n0  \\exp(\\lambda t)  0 \\\\\n0  0  \\exp(\\lambda t)\n\\end{pmatrix} $$\n\nSecond, we compute the exponential of the nilpotent part $N t$. The matrix $N$ is nilpotent because some power of it is the zero matrix. We compute its powers:\n$$ N^2 \\;=\\; N \\cdot N \\;=\\; \\begin{pmatrix}\n0  1  0 \\\\\n0  0  1 \\\\\n0  0  0\n\\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix}\n0  1  0 \\\\\n0  0  1 \\\\\n0  0  0\n\\end{pmatrix} \\;=\\; \\begin{pmatrix}\n0  0  1 \\\\\n0  0  0 \\\\\n0  0  0\n\\end{pmatrix} $$\n$$ N^3 \\;=\\; N^2 \\cdot N \\;=\\; \\begin{pmatrix}\n0  0  1 \\\\\n0  0  0 \\\\\n0  0  0\n\\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix}\n0  1  0 \\\\\n0  0  1 \\\\\n0  0  0\n\\end{pmatrix} \\;=\\; \\begin{pmatrix}\n0  0  0 \\\\\n0  0  0 \\\\\n0  0  0\n\\end{pmatrix} \\;=\\; \\mathbf{0} $$\nSince $N^3 = \\mathbf{0}$, all higher powers $N^k$ for $k \\ge 3$ are also the zero matrix. This means the infinite series for $\\exp(N t)$ truncates after the $k=2$ term:\n$$ \\exp(N t) \\;=\\; \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} \\frac{(N t)^k}{k!} \\;=\\; \\frac{(N t)^0}{0!} + \\frac{(N t)^1}{1!} + \\frac{(N t)^2}{2!} + \\mathbf{0} + \\dots $$\n$$ \\exp(N t) \\;=\\; I + N t + \\frac{1}{2} N^2 t^2 $$\n$$ \\exp(N t) \\;=\\; \\begin{pmatrix}\n1  0  0 \\\\\n0  1  0 \\\\\n0  0  1\n\\end{pmatrix} + t \\begin{pmatrix}\n0  1  0 \\\\\n0  0  1 \\\\\n0  0  0\n\\end{pmatrix} + \\frac{t^2}{2} \\begin{pmatrix}\n0  0  1 \\\\\n0  0  0 \\\\\n0  0  0\n\\end{pmatrix} \\;=\\; \\begin{pmatrix}\n1  t  \\frac{t^2}{2} \\\\\n0  1  t \\\\\n0  0  1\n\\end{pmatrix} $$\n\nCombining these results, we find the closed-form expression for $\\exp(J t)$:\n$$ \\exp(J t) \\;=\\; \\exp(\\lambda I t) \\exp(N t) \\;=\\; \\exp(\\lambda t) I \\begin{pmatrix}\n1  t  \\frac{t^2}{2} \\\\\n0  1  t \\\\\n0  0  1\n\\end{pmatrix} $$\n$$ \\exp(J t) \\;=\\; \\begin{pmatrix}\n\\exp(\\lambda t)  t \\exp(\\lambda t)  \\frac{t^2}{2} \\exp(\\lambda t) \\\\\n0  \\exp(\\lambda t)  t \\exp(\\lambda t) \\\\\n0  0  \\exp(\\lambda t)\n\\end{pmatrix} $$\n\nThe components of the solution $z(t) = \\exp(Jt)z(0)$ are linear combinations of the terms in the matrix $\\exp(Jt)$. These terms are of the form $p_k(t) \\exp(\\lambda t)$, where $p_k(t)$ are polynomials in time $t$. The polynomials arising from the $3 \\times 3$ Jordan block are $1$, $t$, and $\\frac{t^2}{2}$. These are the polynomial-in-time factors that modulate the transient dynamics.\n\nFor a stable system, such as a dissipative biochemical network, the real part of the eigenvalues must be negative, so $\\lambda  0$. The dynamics are governed by terms of the form $t^n \\exp(\\lambda t)$ where $n \\in \\{0, 1, 2\\}$. The term $\\exp(\\lambda t)$ ensures that the state deviation $z(t)$ ultimately decays to zero as $t \\to \\infty$, since exponential decay always dominates polynomial growth. However, the polynomial factors $t^n$ cause a temporary, or transient, growth in the magnitude of the state variables. For example, the function $f(t) = t^n \\exp(\\lambda t)$ for $n>0$ and $\\lambda  0$ starts at $f(0)=0$, increases to a maximum at $t = -n/\\lambda$, and then decays to zero. This phenomenon is an algebraic amplification of the transient response. It means that even for a stable equilibrium, a perturbation can initially grow, moving the system further from equilibrium before it eventually returns. This is a hallmark of defective dynamics.\n\nFinally, we compute the first component of the state vector, $z_1(t)$, given the initial condition $z(0) = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}$.\nThe state vector at time $t$ is given by $z(t) = \\exp(J t) z(0)$:\n$$ \\begin{pmatrix} z_1(t) \\\\ z_2(t) \\\\ z_3(t) \\end{pmatrix} \\;=\\; \\begin{pmatrix}\n\\exp(\\lambda t)  t \\exp(\\lambda t)  \\frac{t^2}{2} \\exp(\\lambda t) \\\\\n0  \\exp(\\lambda t)  t \\exp(\\lambda t) \\\\\n0  0  \\exp(\\lambda t)\n\\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix}\n0 \\\\\n0 \\\\\n1\n\\end{pmatrix} $$\nPerforming the matrix-vector multiplication, we focus on the first row to find $z_1(t)$:\n$$ z_1(t) \\;=\\; (0) \\cdot \\exp(\\lambda t) + (0) \\cdot t \\exp(\\lambda t) + (1) \\cdot \\frac{t^2}{2} \\exp(\\lambda t) $$\n$$ z_1(t) \\;=\\; \\frac{t^2}{2} \\exp(\\lambda t) $$\nThis expression represents the evolution of the first component of the state in Jordan coordinates. It clearly shows the interplay between the algebraic growth term $t^2/2$ and the exponential decay term $\\exp(\\lambda t)$.",
