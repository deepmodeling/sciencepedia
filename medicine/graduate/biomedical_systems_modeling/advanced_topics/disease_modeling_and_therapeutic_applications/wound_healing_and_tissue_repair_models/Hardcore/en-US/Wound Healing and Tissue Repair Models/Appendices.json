            "problem": "Fibroblast chemotaxis and proliferation in wound healing are driven by receptor-mediated signaling initiated when Platelet-Derived Growth Factor (PDGF) binds its surface receptor. Consider a single cell type with one-to-one reversible binding between receptor and ligand, modeled by the reaction $R + L \\rightleftharpoons RL$, where $R$ denotes free receptor, $L$ denotes free ligand, and $RL$ denotes receptor–ligand complex. Assume fast binding equilibration relative to downstream responses and a single noninteracting binding site per receptor.

            "solution": "The problem statement describes a classic single-site, reversible ligand-receptor binding equilibrium, a fundamental concept in pharmacology and cell signaling. The problem is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. It provides sufficient and consistent data to proceed with a solution. The given temperature of $37^{\\circ}\\text{C}$ establishes the physiological context but does not enter the calculations directly, as the dissociation constant $K_{d}$ is defined under these specific isothermal conditions.\n\nFirst, we derive the equilibrium binding relationship. The reaction is given as:\n$$R + L \\rightleftharpoons RL$$\nwhere $R$ represents the free receptor, $L$ the free ligand, and $RL$ the receptor-ligand complex. According to the law of mass action, the forward rate of complex formation is proportional to the product of the concentrations of free receptors and free ligands, $k_{\\text{on}}[R][L]$, while the reverse rate of complex dissociation is proportional to the concentration of the complex, $k_{\\text{off}}[RL]$. At equilibrium, these rates are equal:\n$$k_{\\text{on}}[R][L] = k_{\\text{off}}[RL]$$\nThe equilibrium dissociation constant, $K_{d}$, is defined as the ratio of the off-rate constant to the on-rate constant:\n$$K_{d} = \\frac{k_{\\text{off}}}{k_{\\text{on}}} = \\frac{[R][L]}{[RL]}$$\nIn this problem, the concentrations of receptor species are given in terms of the number of molecules per cell, which are directly proportional to their effective concentrations on the cell surface. The ligand concentration is given as a molar concentration, $c$. Let $R_{\\text{free}}$ denote the number of free receptors per cell and $RL$ denote the number of bound receptors per cell. The free ligand concentration is $c$. Thus, the equilibrium relationship connecting these quantities is:\n$$K_{d} = \\frac{R_{\\text{free}} \\cdot c}{RL}$$\nThis is the fundamental relationship requested. To make this useful for data analysis, we express it in terms of the total number of receptors per cell, $R_{\\text{tot}}$. The total number of receptors is conserved:\n$$R_{\\text{tot}} = R_{\\text{free}} + RL$$\nSubstituting $R_{\\text{free}} = R_{\\text{tot}} - RL$ into the expression for $K_{d}$:\n$$K_{d} = \\frac{(R_{\\text{tot}} - RL) \\cdot c}{RL}$$\nThis equation can be rearranged to express the number of bound receptors, $RL$, as a function of the ligand concentration, $c$:\n$$K_{d} \\cdot RL = (R_{\\text{tot}} - RL)c$$\n$$K_{d} \\cdot RL = R_{\\text{tot}} \\cdot c - RL \\cdot c$$\n$$RL \\cdot (K_{d} + c) = R_{\\text{tot}} \\cdot c$$\n$$RL(c) = \\frac{R_{\\text{tot}} \\cdot c}{K_{d} + c}$$\nThis is the Langmuir binding isotherm, a hyperbolic relationship between ligand concentration and receptor occupancy.\n\nNext, we use the provided experimental data to estimate the value of $K_{d}$. We are given $R_{\\text{tot}} = 9.0 \\times 10^{4}$ molecules per cell. We can rearrange the binding equation to solve for $K_{d}$:\n$$K_{d} = \\frac{(R_{\\text{tot}} - RL) \\cdot c}{RL} = \\left(\\frac{R_{\\text{tot}}}{RL} - 1\\right)c$$\nWe can now calculate $K_{d}$ for each data point.\n\n1.  For $c = 0.5\\,\\text{nM}$ and $RL = 1.80 \\times 10^{4}$:\n    $$K_{d} = \\left(\\frac{9.0 \\times 10^{4}}{1.80 \\times 10^{4}} - 1\\right) \\cdot 0.5 = (5.0 - 1) \\cdot 0.5 = 4.0 \\cdot 0.5 = 2.0\\,\\text{nM}$$\n2.  For $c = 1.0\\,\\text{nM}$ and $RL = 3.00 \\times 10^{4}$:\n    $$K_{d} = \\left(\\frac{9.0 \\times 10^{4}}{3.00 \\times 10^{4}} - 1\\right) \\cdot 1.0 = (3.0 - 1) \\cdot 1.0 = 2.0 \\cdot 1.0 = 2.0\\,\\text{nM}$$\n3.  For $c = 2.0\\,\\text{nM}$ and $RL = 4.50 \\times 10^{4}$:\n    $$K_{d} = \\left(\\frac{9.0 \\times 10^{4}}{4.50 \\times 10^{4}} - 1\\right) \\cdot 2.0 = (2.0 - 1) \\cdot 2.0 = 1.0 \\cdot 2.0 = 2.0\\,\\text{nM}$$\n4.  For $c = 5.0\\,\\text{nM}$ and $RL = 6.43 \\times 10^{4}$:\n    $$K_{d} = \\left(\\frac{9.0 \\times 10^{4}}{6.43 \\times 10^{4}} - 1\\right) \\cdot 5.0 \\approx (1.3997 - 1) \\cdot 5.0 = 0.3997 \\cdot 5.0 \\approx 1.9985\\,\\text{nM}$$\n5.  For $c = 10.0\\,\\text{nM}$ and $RL = 7.50 \\times 10^{4}$:\n    $$K_{d} = \\left(\\frac{9.0 \\times 10^{4}}{7.50 \\times 10^{4}} - 1\\right) \\cdot 10.0 = (1.2 - 1) \\cdot 10.0 = 0.2 \\cdot 10.0 = 2.0\\,\\text{nM}$$\n\nThe calculations for all data points yield a highly consistent value for $K_{d}$, which is approximately $2.0\\,\\text{nM}$. The minor deviation in the fourth point is attributable to the precision of the input data. An alternative, graphical method such as a Scatchard plot ($\\frac{RL}{c}$ vs. $RL$) would show these points lying on a straight line with a slope of $-\\frac{1}{K_{d}}$, confirming this result. Given the consistency, a simple average is sufficient, yielding an estimated value for the dissociation constant $K_{d} = 2.00\\,\\text{nM}$ when expressed to three significant figures.\n\nFinally, we justify the form of a downstream effective signaling term, $S(c) = S_{\\max} \\, c/(K_{d} + c)$. A common and fundamental assumption in modeling signal transduction is that the magnitude of the downstream biological response, $S(c)$, is directly proportional to the number of occupied receptors, $RL(c)$. This assumes that each receptor-ligand complex contributes equally and independently to the total signal.\nMathematically, this proportionality can be written as:\n$$S(c) = k_{s} \\cdot RL(c)$$\nwhere $k_{s}$ is a signaling transduction constant.\nSubstituting the derived expression for $RL(c)$:\n$$S(c) = k_{s} \\left( \\frac{R_{\\text{tot}} \\cdot c}{K_{d} + c} \\right)$$\nThe maximum possible signal, $S_{\\max}$, is achieved when the ligand concentration is saturating ($c \\to \\infty$), which leads to the maximum possible number of bound receptors ($RL \\to R_{\\text{tot}}$). Therefore, the maximal signal is:\n$$S_{\\max} = \\lim_{c\\to\\infty} S(c) = k_{s} \\cdot R_{\\text{tot}}$$\nBy substituting $k_{s} \\cdot R_{\\text{tot}}$ with $S_{\\max}$ in the expression for $S(c)$, we obtain the required signaling term:\n$$S(c) = S_{\\max} \\left( \\frac{c}{K_{d} + c} \\right)$$\nThis form shows how the parameters of the initial binding event ($K_{d}$) directly propagate into the functional form of the downstream response. The dissociation constant $K_{d}$ here plays the role of the half-maximal effective concentration (EC50). That is, when the ligand concentration $c$ is equal to $K_{d}$, the signal $S(c)$ is exactly half of its maximum:\n$$S(K_{d}) = S_{\\max} \\left( \\frac{K_{d}}{K_{d} + K_{d}} \\right) = S_{\\max} \\left( \\frac{K_{d}}{2K_{d}} \\right) = \\frac{1}{2} S_{\\max}$$\nThus, $K_{d}$ determines the sensitivity of the cellular response to the ligand concentration. A lower $K_{d}$ implies higher binding affinity and a cellular response that is more sensitive to low concentrations of the ligand.",

            "solution": "The problem is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and provides a complete set of specifications for a numerical simulation study of a wound healing model. All required parameters, equations, and conditions are explicitly defined. The underlying model is the Fisher-Kolmogorov-Petrovsky-Piskunov (FKPP) equation, a canonical reaction-diffusion model widely used in mathematical biology. The parameter values and simulation setup are physically realistic and computationally feasible. The stability criterion for the numerical scheme is specified and satisfied by the given parameters. The analysis via Shapley decomposition is a well-defined method for attributing effects in multi-factorial systems. The problem is therefore deemed valid.\n\nThe solution proceeds in three stages: first, the derivation and discretization of the governing partial differential equation (PDE); second, the implementation of the numerical simulation to find wound closure times under various conditions; and third, the analysis of these closure times to quantify the relative contributions of impaired cell migration and proliferation.\n\n**1. Governing Equation and Discretization**\n\nThe model is based on a conservation law for the epithelial cell density $E(x,t)$, which states that the rate of change of cell density at a point is the sum of net cell migration (flux) and local cell proliferation (source).\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial E}{\\partial t} = - \\frac{\\partial J}{\\partial x} + S(E)\n$$\nCell migration is modeled as a Fickian diffusion process, where the cell flux $J$ is proportional to the negative gradient of the cell density:\n$$\nJ = - D \\frac{\\partial E}{\\partial x}\n$$\nHere, $D$ is the effective motility or diffusion coefficient. Cell proliferation is described by a logistic growth model, where cells proliferate at a rate $r$ up to a maximum carrying capacity density $K$:\n$$\nS(E) = r E \\left( 1 - \\frac{E}{K} \\right)\n$$\nSubstituting the expressions for $J$ and $S(E)$ into the conservation law yields the governing PDE, a form of the FKPP equation:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial E}{\\partial t} = D \\frac{\\partial^2 E}{\\partial x^2} + r E \\left(1 - \\frac{E}{K}\\right)\n$$\nTo solve this equation numerically, we employ an explicit finite-difference method. The spatial domain, of length $L$, is discretized into a grid of points $x_i = i \\Delta x$, and time is discretized into steps $t_n = n \\Delta t$. Let $E_i^n$ represent the density at position $x_i$ and time $t_n$. The partial derivatives are approximated using finite differences: a forward difference for the time derivative and a second-order central difference for the spatial derivative.\n\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial E}{\\partial t} \\bigg|_{i,n} \\approx \\frac{E_i^{n+1} - E_i^n}{\\Delta t}\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial^2 E}{\\partial x^2} \\bigg|_{i,n} \\approx \\frac{E_{i+1}^n - 2E_i^n + E_{i-1}^n}{\\Delta x^2}\n$$\nSubstituting these approximations into the PDE and rearranging for $E_i^{n+1}$ gives the explicit update rule for the interior grid points:\n$$\nE_i^{n+1} = E_i^n + \\Delta t \\left[ D \\left( \\frac{E_{i+1}^n - 2E_i^n + E_{i-1}^n}{\\Delta x^2} \\right) + r E_i^n \\left(1 - \\frac{E_i^n}{K}\\right) \\right]\n$$\nThis scheme is stable provided the time step $\\Delta t$ satisfies the diffusive stability criterion $\\Delta t \\le \\frac{(\\Delta x)^2}{2D}$. The problem parameters are chosen to respect this condition.\n\n**2. Boundary and Initial Conditions**\n\nThe simulation is performed on a finite domain of length $L$, which we define from $x = -L/2$ to $x = L/2$. The problem specifies zero-flux (Neumann) boundary conditions at the domain edges, meaning $\\frac{\\partial E}{\\partial x} = 0$ at $x = \\pm L/2$. For a central difference scheme, this condition is implemented using \"ghost points\". For the boundary at $x_0 = -L/2$, we introduce a ghost point $E_{-1}$ and enforce the condition as $\\frac{E_1 - E_{-1}}{2\\Delta x} = 0$, which implies $E_{-1} = E_1$. The Laplacian term at $i=0$ becomes:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial^2 E}{\\partial x^2} \\bigg|_{0,n} \\approx \\frac{E_{1}^n - 2E_0^n + E_{-1}^n}{\\Delta x^2} = \\frac{2(E_{1}^n - E_0^n)}{\\Delta x^2}\n$$\nA symmetric formulation applies at the right boundary, $x_{N_x-1} = L/2$.\n\nThe initial condition specifies a wound of width $W$ centered at $x=0$, where the cell density is zero, surrounded by healthy tissue at carrying capacity density $K$.\n$$\nE(x,0) = \\begin{cases} 0 & \\text{for } |x| \\le W/2 \\\\ K & \\text{for } |x| > W/2 \\end{cases}\n$$\nThe simulation proceeds by iterating the update rule from $t=0$ up to a maximum time $T_{\\max}$. At each time step, the cell density at the wound center, $E(0,t)$, is checked against the closure criterion $E(0,t) \\ge \\theta K$. The first time this condition is met is recorded as the closure time $T$. If the condition is not met by $T_{\\max}$, the closure time is reported as $T_{\\max}$ and an associated flag is set to $0$.\n\n**3. Hyperglycemia Model and Contribution Analysis**\n\nHyperglycemia is modeled by reducing the baseline motility coefficient $D$ and proliferation rate $r$ by multiplicative factors $\\alpha_D$ and $\\alpha_r$ respectively, where $0 < \\alpha_D, \\alpha_r \\le 1$. Four separate simulations are run for each test case:\n1.  **Baseline:** $(D, r)$ yielding closure time $T_{\\text{base}}$.\n2.  **Migration-Impaired:** $(\\alpha_D D, r)$ yielding closure time $T_D$.\n3.  **Proliferation-Reduced:** $(D, \\alpha_r r)$ yielding closure time $T_r$.\n4.  **Hyperglycemic (Both Impaired):** $(\\alpha_D D, \\alpha_r r)$ yielding closure time $T_{\\text{hyp}}$.\n\nThe total increase in closure time due to hyperglycemia is $\\Delta T = T_{\\text{hyp}} - T_{\\text{base}}$. To decompose this increase into contributions from the two impairments, we use a Shapley-style formulation. The contribution of impaired migration, $\\phi_{\\text{mig}}$, is the average of its marginal effects in two contexts: when proliferation is normal, and when it is reduced.\n$$\n\\phi_{\\text{mig}} = \\frac{1}{2}\\left[ (T_{D} - T_{\\text{base}}) + (T_{\\text{hyp}} - T_{r}) \\right]\n$$\nSimilarly, the contribution of reduced proliferation, $\\phi_{\\text{pro}}$, is:\n$$\n\\phi_{\\text{pro}} = \\frac{1}{2}\\left[ (T_{r} - T_{\\text{base}}) + (T_{\\text{hyp}} - T_{D}) \\right]\n$$\nThese contributions sum exactly to the total increase, $\\phi_{\\text{mig}} + \\phi_{\\text{pro}} = \\Delta T$. The relative contributions are then $c_{\\text{mig}} = \\phi_{\\text{mig}} / \\Delta T$ and $c_{\\text{pro}} = \\phi_{\\text{pro}} / \\Delta T$. If $\\Delta T \\le 0$, both relative contributions are defined as $0$. The final implementation encapsulates this entire process.",
