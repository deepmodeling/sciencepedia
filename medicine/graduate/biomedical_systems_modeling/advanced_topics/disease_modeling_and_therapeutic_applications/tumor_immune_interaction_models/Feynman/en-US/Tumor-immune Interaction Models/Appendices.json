The solution process will proceed.\n\n### Derivation of the Solution\n\nThe derivation proceeds in two stages. First, we solve for the specific growth rate $g(t)$. Second, we use this result to solve for the tumor cell number $T(t)$.\n\n**Stage 1: Solving for the specific growth rate $g(t)$**\n\nWe are given the first-order linear homogeneous ODE for $g(t)$:\n$$\n\\frac{dg(t)}{dt} = -\\gamma\\, g(t)\n$$\nThis equation can be solved by separation of variables. For $g(t) \\neq 0$:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{g(t)} dg(t) = -\\gamma\\, dt\n$$\nIntegrating both sides from the initial time $t=0$ to a general time $t$:\n$$\n\\int_{g(0)}^{g(t)} \\frac{1}{g'} dg' = \\int_{0}^{t} -\\gamma\\, d\\tau\n$$\n$$\n[\\ln|g'|]_{g(0)}^{g(t)} = [-\\gamma\\, \\tau]_{0}^{t}\n$$\nSince $g(0)=g_0 > 0$ and $g(t)$ must be continuous, $g(t)$ will remain positive for all $t$. Thus, we can drop the absolute value.\n$$\n\\ln(g(t)) - \\ln(g(0)) = -\\gamma\\, t\n$$\nSubstituting the initial condition $g(0) = g_0$:\n$$\n\\ln(g(t)) = \\ln(g_0) - \\gamma\\, t\n$$\nExponentiating both sides to solve for $g(t)$:\n$$\ng(t) = \\exp(\\ln(g_0) - \\gamma\\, t) = \\exp(\\ln(g_0)) \\exp(-\\gamma\\, t)\n$$\n$$\ng(t) = g_0 \\exp(-\\gamma\\, t)\n$$\nThis expression shows that the specific growth rate decays exponentially from its initial value $g_0$ with a decay constant $\\gamma$.\n\n**Stage 2: Solving for the tumor cell number $T(t)$**\n\nNow we use the definition of the specific growth rate, substituting our newly found expression for $g(t)$:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{T(t)}\\frac{dT(t)}{dt} = g(t) = g_0 \\exp(-\\gamma\\, t)\n$$\nThis can be rewritten as:\n$$\n\\frac{d}{dt}(\\ln(T(t))) = g_0 \\exp(-\\gamma\\, t)\n$$\nTo find $\\ln(T(t))$, we integrate both sides with respect to time $t$ from $0$ to $t$:\n$$\n\\int_{0}^{t} \\frac{d}{d\\tau}(\\ln(T(\\tau))) d\\tau = \\int_{0}^{t} g_0 \\exp(-\\gamma\\, \\tau) d\\tau\n$$\n$$\n[\\ln(T(\\tau))]_{0}^{t} = g_0 \\left[ -\\frac{1}{\\gamma} \\exp(-\\gamma\\, \\tau) \\right]_{0}^{t}\n$$\n$$\n\\ln(T(t)) - \\ln(T(0)) = -\\frac{g_0}{\\gamma} (\\exp(-\\gamma\\, t) - \\exp(0))\n$$\n$$\n\\ln(T(t)) - \\ln(T(0)) = -\\frac{g_0}{\\gamma} (\\exp(-\\gamma\\, t) - 1)\n$$\n$$\n\\ln(T(t)) - \\ln(T(0)) = \\frac{g_0}{\\gamma} (1 - \\exp(-\\gamma\\, t))\n$$\nNow, substitute the initial condition $T(0) = T_0$:\n$$\n\\ln(T(t)) = \\ln(T_0) + \\frac{g_0}{\\gamma} (1 - \\exp(-\\gamma\\, t))\n$$\nTo obtain the final closed-form expression for $T(t)$, we exponentiate both sides:\n$$\nT(t) = \\exp\\left( \\ln(T_0) + \\frac{g_0}{\\gamma} (1 - \\exp(-\\gamma\\, t)) \\right)\n$$\n$$\nT(t) = \\exp(\\ln(T_0)) \\exp\\left( \\frac{g_0}{\\gamma} (1 - \\exp(-\\gamma\\, t)) \\right)\n$$\n$$\nT(t) = T_0 \\exp\\left( \\frac{g_0}{\\gamma} (1 - \\exp(-\\gamma\\, t)) \\right)\n$$\nThis is the closed-form expression for the tumor cell population as a function of time.\n\n### Interpretation of the Long-Time Limit\n\nThe problem asks to identify and interpret the long-time limit of $T(t)$ as an emergent carrying capacity. We evaluate the limit of $T(t)$ as $t \\to \\infty$:\n$$\n\\lim_{t \\to \\infty} T(t) = \\lim_{t \\to \\infty} T_0 \\exp\\left( \\frac{g_0}{\\gamma} (1 - \\exp(-\\gamma\\, t)) \\right)\n$$\nSince $\\gamma > 0$, the term $\\exp(-\\gamma\\, t)$ approaches $0$ as $t \\to \\infty$.\n$$\n\\lim_{t \\to \\infty} T(t) = T_0 \\exp\\left( \\frac{g_0}{\\gamma} (1 - 0) \\right) = T_0 \\exp\\left( \\frac{g_0}{\\gamma} \\right)\n$$\nThis finite, non-zero limit represents the maximum sustainable tumor size, which is the system's carrying capacity, often denoted by $K$. Thus, the emergent carrying capacity is:\n$$\nK = T_0 \\exp\\left(\\frac{g_0}{\\gamma}\\right)\n$$\nThis carrying capacity is not a predefined parameter but rather emerges from the initial conditions ($T_0$, $g_0$) and the dynamic constraint parameter ($\\gamma$). It represents the equilibrium state where the exponentially decaying specific growth rate has become vanishingly small, and the tumor population has plateaued due to the sustained pressure from the immune system and resource limitations.\n\nThe final answer is the derived closed-form expression for $T(t)$.",

The state is stable if $\\lambda_x  0$ and unstable if $\\lambda_x > 0$.\n\nThe critical nondimensional killing strength, denoted $\\kappa_c$, is the threshold value of $\\kappa$ at which the stability of the tumor-free state changes.

The eigenvalues are real and have opposite signs.\n2.  **Node:** If $\\text{Det}(J^{\\star}) > 0$ and $\\Delta \\ge 0$. The eigenvalues are real and have the same sign.\n    - **Stable Node:** If $\\text{Tr}(J^{\\star})  0$.\n    - **Unstable Node:** If $\\text{Tr}(J^{\\star}) > 0$.\n3.  **Focus (Spiral):** If $\\text{Det}(J^{\\star}) > 0$ and $\\Delta  0$. The eigenvalues are a complex conjugate pair.\n    - **Stable Focus:** If $\\text{Tr}(J^{\\star})  0$.\n    - **Unstable Focus:** If $\\text{Tr}(J^{\\star}) > 0$.\n4.  **Bifurcation Points:**\n    - A **Hopf bifurcation** (transition from node/focus to focus/node with opposite stability) can occur if $\\text{Tr}(J^{\\star}) = 0$ and $\\text{Det}(J^{\\star}) > 0$.\n    - A **saddle-node bifurcation** can occur if $\\text{Det}(J^{\\star}) = 0$.\n\nThe specific parameter combinations that lead to each case depend on the inequalities derived from the expressions for $\\text{Tr}(J^{\\star})$, $\\text{Det}(J^{\\star})$, and $\\Delta$. For example, the sign of $\\text{Det}(J^{\\star})$ depends critically on the magnitude of $T^{\\star}$ relative to $K$ and other parameters, as the two terms in its expression can have different signs. If $T^{\\star} > K/2$, the term $r(1 - 2T^{\\star}/K)$ is negative, and since $(cT^{\\star}/(h+T^{\\star}) - d)$ is also negative, their product is positive. The second term in $\\text{Det}(J^{\\star})$ is also positive (since $T^{\\star}  K$). Thus, for $T^{\\star} > K/2$, the equilibrium cannot be a saddle. Stability then depends on the sign of the trace. The rich dynamics of the system are captured in these conditions.\n\nThe final required answer consists of the symbolic expressions for the trace, determinant, and discriminant.",
