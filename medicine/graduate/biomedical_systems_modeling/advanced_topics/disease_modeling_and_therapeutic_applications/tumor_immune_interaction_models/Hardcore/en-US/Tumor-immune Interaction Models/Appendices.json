The task is to derive a closed-form expression for the tumor cell population $T(t)$ and interpret its long-term behavior.\n\n### Problem Validation\n\n**Step 1: Extract Givens**\n-   The viable tumor cell number at time $t$ is denoted by $T(t)$.\n-   The specific growth rate is defined as $g(t) = \\frac{1}{T(t)}\\frac{dT(t)}{dt}$.\n-   The specific growth rate follows the ordinary differential equation (ODE): $\\frac{dg(t)}{dt} = -\\gamma\\, g(t)$, with $\\gamma  0$.\n-   Initial conditions are given: $T(0) = T_{0}  0$ and $g(0) = g_{0}  0$.\n\n**Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens**\nThe problem is evaluated against the validation criteria:\n-   **Scientifically Grounded**: The model is a classic phenomenological description of constrained growth, known as the Gompertz model. The premise of an exponentially decaying specific growth rate is a standard assumption in modeling tumor dynamics under resource and immune pressure. The model is scientifically valid within the context of mathematical biology.\n-   **Well-Posed**: The problem sets up a system of two first-order ordinary differential equations with two initial conditions. This is a well-posed initial value problem that admits a unique, stable solution.\n-   **Objective**: The problem is stated in precise mathematical and scientific language, free of subjective claims.\n-   **Complete and Consistent**: All necessary equations, variables, constants, and initial conditions are provided. There are no contradictions.\n-   **Not Trivial**: The solution requires the sequential integration of two coupled ODEs, which is a standard but non-trivial exercise in differential equations.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid as it is mathematically sound, scientifically grounded, and well-posed. The solution process will proceed.\n\n### Derivation of the Solution\n\nThe derivation proceeds in two stages. First, we solve for the specific growth rate $g(t)$. Second, we use this result to solve for the tumor cell number $T(t)$.\n\n**Stage 1: Solving for the specific growth rate $g(t)$**\n\nWe are given the first-order linear homogeneous ODE for $g(t)$:\n$$\n\\frac{dg(t)}{dt} = -\\gamma\\, g(t)\n$$\nThis equation can be solved by separation of variables. For $g(t) \\neq 0$:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{g(t)} dg(t) = -\\gamma\\, dt\n$$\nIntegrating both sides from the initial time $t=0$ to a general time $t$:\n$$\n\\int_{g(0)}^{g(t)} \\frac{1}{g'} dg' = \\int_{0}^{t} -\\gamma\\, d\\tau\n$$\n$$\n[\\ln|g'|]_{g(0)}^{g(t)} = [-\\gamma\\, \\tau]_{0}^{t}\n$$\nSince $g(0)=g_0  0$ and $g(t)$ must be continuous, $g(t)$ will remain positive for all $t$. Thus, we can drop the absolute value.\n$$\n\\ln(g(t)) - \\ln(g(0)) = -\\gamma\\, t\n$$\nSubstituting the initial condition $g(0) = g_{0}$:\n$$\n\\ln(g(t)) = \\ln(g_{0}) - \\gamma\\, t\n$$\nExponentiating both sides to solve for $g(t)$:\n$$\ng(t) = \\exp(\\ln(g_{0}) - \\gamma\\, t) = \\exp(\\ln(g_{0})) \\exp(-\\gamma\\, t)\n$$\n$$\ng(t) = g_{0} \\exp(-\\gamma\\, t)\n$$\nThis expression shows that the specific growth rate decays exponentially from its initial value $g_{0}$ with a decay constant $\\gamma$.\n\n**Stage 2: Solving for the tumor cell number $T(t)$**\n\nNow we use the definition of the specific growth rate, substituting our newly found expression for $g(t)$:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{T(t)}\\frac{dT(t)}{dt} = g(t) = g_{0} \\exp(-\\gamma\\, t)\n$$\nThis can be rewritten as:\n$$\n\\frac{d}{dt}(\\ln(T(t))) = g_{0} \\exp(-\\gamma\\, t)\n$$\nTo find $\\ln(T(t))$, we integrate both sides with respect to time $t$ from $0$ to $t$:\n$$\n\\int_{0}^{t} \\frac{d}{d\\tau}(\\ln(T(\\tau))) d\\tau = \\int_{0}^{t} g_{0} \\exp(-\\gamma\\, \\tau) d\\tau\n$$\n$$\n[\\ln(T(\\tau))]_{0}^{t} = g_{0} \\left[ -\\frac{1}{\\gamma} \\exp(-\\gamma\\, \\tau) \\right]_{0}^{t}\n$$\n$$\n\\ln(T(t)) - \\ln(T(0)) = -\\frac{g_{0}}{\\gamma} (\\exp(-\\gamma\\, t) - \\exp(0))\n$$\n$$\n\\ln(T(t)) - \\ln(T(0)) = -\\frac{g_{0}}{\\gamma} (\\exp(-\\gamma\\, t) - 1)\n$$\n$$\n\\ln(T(t)) - \\ln(T(0)) = \\frac{g_{0}}{\\gamma} (1 - \\exp(-\\gamma\\, t))\n$$\nNow, substitute the initial condition $T(0) = T_{0}$:\n$$\n\\ln(T(t)) = \\ln(T_{0}) + \\frac{g_{0}}{\\gamma} (1 - \\exp(-\\gamma\\, t))\n$$\nTo obtain the final closed-form expression for $T(t)$, we exponentiate both sides:\n$$\nT(t) = \\exp\\left( \\ln(T_{0}) + \\frac{g_{0}}{\\gamma} (1 - \\exp(-\\gamma\\, t)) \\right)\n$$\n$$\nT(t) = \\exp(\\ln(T_{0})) \\exp\\left( \\frac{g_{0}}{\\gamma} (1 - \\exp(-\\gamma\\, t)) \\right)\n$$\n$$\nT(t) = T_{0} \\exp\\left( \\frac{g_{0}}{\\gamma} (1 - \\exp(-\\gamma\\, t)) \\right)\n$$\nThis is the closed-form expression for the tumor cell population as a function of time.\n\n### Interpretation of the Long-Time Limit\n\nThe problem asks to identify and interpret the long-time limit of $T(t)$ as an emergent carrying capacity. We evaluate the limit of $T(t)$ as $t \\to \\infty$:\n$$\n\\lim_{t \\to \\infty} T(t) = \\lim_{t \\to \\infty} T_{0} \\exp\\left( \\frac{g_{0}}{\\gamma} (1 - \\exp(-\\gamma\\, t)) \\right)\n$$\nSince $\\gamma  0$, the term $\\exp(-\\gamma\\, t)$ approaches $0$ as $t \\to \\infty$.\n$$\n\\lim_{t \\to \\infty} T(t) = T_{0} \\exp\\left( \\frac{g_{0}}{\\gamma} (1 - 0) \\right) = T_{0} \\exp\\left( \\frac{g_{0}}{\\gamma} \\right)\n$$\nThis finite, non-zero limit represents the maximum sustainable tumor size, which is the system's carrying capacity, often denoted by $K$. Thus, the emergent carrying capacity is:\n$$\nK = T_{0} \\exp\\left(\\frac{g_{0}}{\\gamma}\\right)\n$$\nThis carrying capacity is not a predefined parameter but rather emerges from the initial conditions ($T_0$, $g_0$) and the dynamic constraint parameter ($\\gamma$). It represents the equilibrium state where the exponentially decaying specific growth rate has become vanishingly small, and the tumor population has plateaued due to the sustained pressure from the immune system and resource limitations.\n\nThe final answer is the derived closed-form expression for $T(t)$.",

The state is stable if $\\lambda_x  0$ and unstable if $\\lambda_x  0$.\n\nThe critical nondimensional killing strength, denoted $\\kappa_c$, is the threshold value of $\\kappa$ at which the stability of the tumor-free state changes.

Since $J_{\\text{TFE}}$ is a lower triangular matrix, its eigenvalues are simply its diagonal entries:\n$$\n\\lambda_1 = r - \\kappa \\frac{s}{d}\n$$\n$$\n\\lambda_2 = -d\n$$\nThe problem asks for analysis of the \"dominant eigenvalue associated with tumor dynamics,\" which is $\\lambda_1$, as it arises from the $\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial T}$ term and governs the initial growth or decay of the tumor population $T$ near $T=0$. We will denote this eigenvalue as $\\lambda$.\n$$\n\\lambda = r - \\kappa \\frac{s}{d}\n$$\nFor the TFE to be locally asymptotically stable, the real parts of all eigenvalues must be strictly negative. We are given that $d  0$, so $\\lambda_2 = -d$ is always real and negative. Therefore, stability is determined entirely by the sign of $\\lambda$.\nThe condition for strict stability is $\\lambda  0$:\n$$\nr - \\kappa \\frac{s}{d}  0 \\implies r  \\kappa \\frac{s}{d}\n$$\nIf $r - \\kappa \\frac{s}{d} \\ge 0$, the equilibrium is unstable. The problem specifies that the boundary case $\\lambda=0$ is considered not stable.\n\n**4. Sensitivity Analysis**\nWe are asked to find the local sensitivity of $\\lambda$ with respect to $\\kappa$, and the normalized sensitivity index.\nThe eigenvalue of interest is $\\lambda = r - \\kappa \\frac{s}{d}$.\n\nThe local sensitivity is the partial derivative of $\\lambda$ with respect to $\\kappa$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial \\lambda}{\\partial \\kappa} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\kappa} \\left(r - \\kappa \\frac{s}{d}\\right) = -\\frac{s}{d}\n$$\nRecalling that $E^\\ast = s/d$, the sensitivity is simply $-E^\\ast$.\n\nThe normalized sensitivity index $S_{\\mathrm{rel}}$ is defined as $S_{\\mathrm{rel}} = \\left(\\frac{\\kappa}{|\\lambda|}\\right)\\frac{\\partial \\lambda}{\\partial \\kappa}$. Substituting our derived sensitivity:\n$$\nS_{\\mathrm{rel}} = \\frac{\\kappa}{|\\lambda|} \\left(-\\frac{s}{d}\\right) = -\\frac{\\kappa (s/d)}{|\\lambda|} = -\\frac{\\kappa E^\\ast}{|\\lambda|}\n$$\nThe problem provides a regularized formula for computation to avoid division by zero when $\\lambda = 0$:\n$$\nS_{\\mathrm{rel}} = -\\frac{\\kappa E^\\ast}{|\\lambda| + \\varepsilon}\n$$\nwhere $\\varepsilon = 10^{-12} \\text{ day}^{-1}$. This formula will be implemented directly.\n\nNote that the parameters $K$, $p$, and $h$ do not appear in the expressions for the eigenvalues at the TFE or the sensitivity of $\\lambda$. This is expected, as the term involving $K$ is of order $T^2$, and the terms involving $p$ and $h$ are multiplied by $T$, all of which become zero or irrelevant in the linearization at $T=0$.\n\n**Summary of Formulas for Calculation:**\nFor each test case with parameters $(r, K, \\kappa)$ and fixed parameters $(s, d, p, h)$:\n1.  Calculate immune equilibrium: $E^\\ast = s/d$.\n2.  Calculate the dominant eigenvalue: $\\lambda = r - \\kappa E^\\ast$.\n3.  Determine stability: The TFE is stable if and only if $\\lambda  0$.\n4.  Calculate the normalized sensitivity: $S_{\\mathrm{rel}} = -\\frac{\\kappa E^\\ast}{|\\lambda| + \\varepsilon}$ with $\\varepsilon = 10^{-12}$.\n5.
