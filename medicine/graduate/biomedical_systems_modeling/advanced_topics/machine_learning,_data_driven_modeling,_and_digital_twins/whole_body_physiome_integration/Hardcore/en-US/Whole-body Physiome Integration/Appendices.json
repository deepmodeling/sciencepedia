This first practice focuses on building one such module for the kidney's primary filtration unit, the glomerulus.

            "problem": "A renal microcirculation module is embedded within a whole-body physiome model to capture the coupling between systemic hemodynamics and glomerular filtration. Consider the glomerular capillary tuft bounded upstream by an afferent arteriole with hydrodynamic resistance $R_{A}$ and downstream by an efferent arteriole with hydrodynamic resistance $R_{E}$. The renal artery pressure is $P_{A}$ and the renal vein pressure is $P_{V}$. The glomerular filtration barrier is modeled as a semipermeable membrane characterized by hydraulic conductivity per unit area $L_{p}$, total filtration area $A$, and solute reflection coefficient $\\sigma$ for plasma proteins that contribute to oncotic pressure. The hydrostatic pressures and oncotic pressures on the capillary (glomerular) and urinary (Bowman’s space) sides are denoted $P_{gc}$, $P_{bs}$ and $\\pi_{gc}$, $\\pi_{bs}$, respectively. The Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR) is identified with the net volume flux $J_{v}$ across the glomerular barrier under steady-state conditions.\n\nStarting only from: (i) linear nonequilibrium thermodynamics of membrane transport relating volume flux to driving forces and reflection of osmotic gradients, and (ii) conservation of mass and energy in steady viscous flow with resistors in series applied to the afferent–glomerular–efferent segment, perform the following:\n\n1. Derive the expression for the net volume flux $J_{v}$ across a semipermeable barrier in terms of hydrostatic and oncotic pressure differences, the hydraulic conductivity, area, and reflection coefficient. Define the filtration coefficient $K_{f}$ in terms of $L_{p}$ and $A$.\n\n2. Model the glomerular hydrostatic pressure $P_{gc}$ using the two-resistor series representation of the afferent and efferent arterioles, and express $P_{gc}$ in terms of $P_{A}$, $P_{V}$, $R_{A}$, and $R_{E}$.\n\n3. Combine your results to obtain a single closed-form analytic expression for $\\mathrm{GFR}$ as a function of $K_{f}$, $P_{A}$, $P_{V}$, $R_{A}$, $R_{E}$, $P_{bs}$, $\\sigma$, $\\pi_{gc}$, and $\\pi_{bs}$.\n\nExplain, based on your expression, how changes in $R_{A}$ and $R_{E}$ modulate $\\mathrm{GFR}$ through their effects on $P_{gc}$, holding $\\pi_{gc}$ and $\\pi_{bs}$ fixed. Your final answer must be only the single analytic expression for $\\mathrm{GFR}$, with no units included in the final boxed form. No numerical evaluation is required.",
            "solution": "The derivation will proceed in three steps as requested, followed by an analysis of the result.\n\n1.  **Derivation of Net Volume Flux ($J_v$)**\n\nThe foundation for this derivation is the principle of linear nonequilibrium thermodynamics applied to fluid transport across a semipermeable membrane. The net volume flux, $J_v$, is driven by the net filtration pressure ($P_{net}$) across the membrane. The total flux is the product of this net pressure and the total hydraulic conductance of the membrane.\n\nThe net filtration pressure is the difference between the forces favoring filtration (out of the capillary) and the forces opposing filtration (into the capillary). The forces are composed of hydrostatic pressures ($P$) and colloid osmotic (oncotic) pressures ($\\pi$).\n\nThe hydrostatic pressure gradient favoring filtration is $\\Delta P = P_{gc} - P_{bs}$, where $P_{gc}$ is the glomerular capillary hydrostatic pressure and $P_{bs}$ is the hydrostatic pressure in Bowman's space.\n\nThe oncotic pressure gradient opposing filtration is $\\Delta \\pi = \\pi_{gc} - \\pi_{bs}$, where $\\pi_{gc}$ is the oncotic pressure in the glomerular capillary and $\\pi_{bs}$ is the oncotic pressure in Bowman's space. Since the filtrate in Bowman's space is typically considered protein-free under normal conditions, $\\pi_{bs}$ is usually taken to be zero, but we will retain it for generality as per the problem's variable list.\n\nThe glomerular filtration barrier is not perfectly impermeable to the solutes (plasma proteins) that generate oncotic pressure. The reflection coefficient, $\\sigma$, quantifies this partial permeability, where $\\sigma=1$ for a perfectly impermeable membrane and $\\sigma=0$ for a freely permeable membrane. The *effective* oncotic pressure difference is therefore $\\sigma (\\pi_{gc} - \\pi_{bs})$.\n\nCombining these terms, the net filtration pressure is:\n$$P_{net} = (P_{gc} - P_{bs}) - \\sigma (\\pi_{gc} - \\pi_{bs})$$\nThe total volume flux $J_v$ is proportional to this net pressure. The constant of proportionality is the total hydraulic conductance of the filtration barrier. This conductance is the product of the hydraulic conductivity per unit area, $L_p$, and the total filtration surface area, $A$. This product is defined as the filtration coefficient, $K_f$.\n$$K_f = L_p A$$\nThus, the expression for the net volume flux is:\n$$J_v = K_f [(P_{gc} - P_{bs}) - \\sigma (\\pi_{gc} - \\pi_{bs})]$$\nThis is the Starling equation as applied to glomerular filtration.\n\n2.  **Derivation of Glomerular Hydrostatic Pressure ($P_{gc}$)**\n\nThe problem specifies a two-resistor model for the glomerular microcirculation, with the afferent arteriole resistance $R_A$ upstream and the efferent arteriole resistance $R_E$ downstream of the glomerulus. This system is treated as a simple series circuit where pressure is analogous to voltage, blood flow is analogous to current, and hydrodynamic resistance is analogous to electrical resistance. The driving pressure across the entire segment is $P_A - P_V$, and the total flow through the segment is the renal blood flow, $Q$.\n\nThe total resistance of the series circuit is the sum of the individual resistances:\n$$R_{total} = R_A + R_E$$\nAccording to the fluid dynamics analogue of Ohm's Law, the total flow $Q$ is given by the total pressure drop divided by the total resistance:\n$$Q = \\frac{P_A - P_V}{R_A + R_E}$$\nThe glomerular capillary pressure, $P_{gc}$, is the pressure at the node between the two resistors, $R_A$ and $R_E$. We can calculate this pressure by considering the pressure drop across the afferent arteriole, $R_A$. The pressure drop is $P_A - P_{gc}$. This must be equal to the flow $Q$ multiplied by the resistance $R_A$:\n$$P_A - P_{gc} = Q \\cdot R_A$$\nSolving for $P_{gc}$ gives:\n$$P_{gc} = P_A - Q \\cdot R_A$$\nNow, we substitute the expression for the total flow $Q$:\n$$P_{gc} = P_A - \\left( \\frac{P_A - P_V}{R_A + R_E} \\right) R_A$$\nTo obtain a more insightful form, we find a common denominator:\n$$P_{gc} = \\frac{P_A (R_A + R_E) - (P_A - P_V) R_A}{R_A + R_E}$$\n$$P_{gc} = \\frac{P_A R_A + P_A R_E - P_A R_A + P_V R_A}{R_A + R_E}$$\n$$P_{gc} = \\frac{P_A R_E + P_V R_A}{R_A + R_E}$$\nThis expression for $P_{gc}$ is equivalent to the voltage divider rule in electrical circuits, showing $P_{gc}$ as a weighted average of the upstream pressure $P_A$ and downstream pressure $P_V$, with the weighting determined by the resistances.\n\n3.  **Combined Expression for Glomerular Filtration Rate ($\\mathrm{GFR}$)**\n\nThe problem identifies the Glomerular Filtration Rate ($\\mathrm{GFR}$) with the net volume flux $J_v$ under steady-state conditions. We can therefore find the final expression for $\\mathrm{GFR}$ by substituting the derived expression for $P_{gc}$ from step 2 into the Starling equation from step 1.\nStarting with the equation for $J_v$:\n$$\\mathrm{GFR} = J_v = K_f [(P_{gc} - P_{bs}) - \\sigma (\\pi_{gc} - \\pi_{bs})]$$\nWe substitute $P_{gc} = \\frac{P_A R_E + P_V R_A}{R_A + R_E}$:\n$$\\mathrm{GFR} = K_f \\left[ \\left( \\frac{P_A R_E + P_V R_A}{R_A + R_E} \\right) - P_{bs} - \\sigma (\\pi_{gc} - \\pi_{bs}) \\right]$$\nThis is the single closed-form analytic expression for $\\mathrm{GFR}$ under the assumptions of the model.\n\n**Modulation of $\\mathrm{GFR}$ by $R_A$ and $R_E$:**\n\nThe derived expression shows that the resistances $R_A$ and $R_E$ influence $\\mathrm{GFR}$ exclusively through their effect on the glomerular capillary hydrostatic pressure, $P_{gc}$. We can analyze this effect by examining the partial derivatives of $P_{gc}$ with respect to each resistance, holding all other parameters constant as specified.\n\nEffect of afferent resistance, $R_A$:\n$$\\frac{\\partial P_{gc}}{\\partial R_A} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial R_A} \\left( \\frac{P_A R_E + P_V R_A}{R_A + R_E} \\right) = \\frac{P_V(R_A + R_E) - (P_A R_E + P_V R_A)(1)}{(R_A + R_E)^2} = \\frac{P_V R_E - P_A R_E}{(R_A + R_E)^2} = \\frac{R_E(P_V - P_A)}{(R_A + R_E)^2}$$\nIn a physiological context, the renal artery pressure $P_A$ is substantially higher than the renal vein pressure $P_V$, so $(P_V - P_A)  0$. Since resistances are positive definite ($R_E  0$), the derivative $\\frac{\\partial P_{gc}}{\\partial R_A}$ is negative. This means that increasing the afferent resistance $R_A$ (e.g., through vasoconstriction) causes a decrease in $P_{gc}$. A lower $P_{gc}$ reduces the net filtration pressure, thereby decreasing $\\mathrm{GFR}$.\n\nEffect of efferent resistance, $R_E$:\n$$\\frac{\\partial P_{gc}}{\\partial R_E} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial R_E} \\left( \\frac{P_A R_E + P_V R_A}{R_A + R_E} \\right) = \\frac{P_A(R_A + R_E) - (P_A R_E + P_V R_A)(1)}{(R_A + R_E)^2} = \\frac{P_A R_A - P_V R_A}{(R_A + R_E)^2} = \\frac{R_A(P_A - P_V)}{(R_A + R_E)^2}$$\nSince $P_A  P_V$ and $R_A  0$, the derivative $\\frac{\\partial P_{gc}}{\\partial R_E}$ is positive. This means that increasing the efferent resistance $R_E$ (vasoconstriction) causes an increase in $P_{gc}$. A higher $P_{gc}$ increases the net filtration pressure, thereby increasing $\\mathrm{GFR}$. This happens because increasing resistance downstream of the glomerulus \"dams up\" blood in the capillaries, raising the pressure.\n\nIn summary, the model predicts that afferent arteriole constriction ($R_A \\uparrow$) reduces $\\mathrm{GFR}$, while efferent arteriole constriction ($R_E \\uparrow$) increases $\\mathrm{GFR}$. It is important to note that this model holds $\\pi_{gc}$ constant. In reality, changes in $R_A$ and $R_E$ also alter total renal plasma flow, which in turn affects the axial profile of $\\pi_{gc}$ along the capillary, leading to more complex biphasic responses, particularly for changes in $R_E$. However, based on the specified model constraints, the conclusions are as stated.",

The central plasma compartment is well mixed and instantaneously receives an intravenous bolus input modeled by the Dirac delta function.

Mass Balance for the Tissue Compartments**\nFor each tissue compartment $i \\in \\{1,2\\}$, the rate of change of the amount of drug in the tissue ($V_i C_{t,i}$) is the rate of mass in minus the rate of mass out.\n- Rate of mass in: Blood enters with flow rate $Q_i$ and concentration $C_c(t)$, so the rate is $Q_i C_c(t)$.\n- Rate of mass out: Blood leaves with flow rate $Q_i$.

The condition $a_1 a_2 = a_3$ becomes:\n$$\n(u+v+w)(uv+uw+vw) = uvw(1 + \\eta\\gamma K_c s_c)\n$$\nUsing the identity $(u+v+w)(uv+uw+vw) = (u+v)(v+w)(w+u) + uvw$, we get:\n$$\n(u+v)(v+w)(w+u) + uvw = uvw + uvw(\\eta\\gamma K_c s_c)\n$$\n$$\n(u+v)(v+w)(w+u) = uvw(\\eta\\gamma K_c s_c)\n$$\nSolving for $K_c$:\n$$\nK_c = \\frac{(u+v)(v+w)(w+u)}{\\eta\\gamma s_c uvw}\n$$\nSubstituting back the time constants:\n$$\nK_c = \\frac{\\left(\\frac{1}{\\tau_c}+\\frac{1}{\\tau_A}\\right)\\left(\\frac{1}{\\tau_A}+\\frac{1}{\\tau_N}\\right)\\left(\\frac{1}{\\tau_N}+\\frac{1}{\\tau_c}\\right)}{\\eta\\gamma s_c \\left(\\frac{1}{\\tau_c\\tau_A\\tau_N}\\right)}\n$$\n$$\nK_c = \\frac{\\left(\\frac{\\tau_c+\\tau_A}{\\tau_c\\tau_A}\\right)\\left(\\frac{\\tau_A+\\tau_N}{\\tau_A\\tau_N}\\right)\\left(\\frac{\\tau_N+\\tau_c}{\\tau_N\\tau_c}\\right)}{\\eta\\gamma s_c \\left(\\frac{1}{\\tau_c\\tau_A\\tau_N}\\right)}\n$$\n$$\nK_c = \\frac{(\\tau_c+\\tau_A)(\\tau_A+\\tau_N)(\\tau_N+\\tau_c)}{\\tau_c^2\\tau_A^2\\tau_N^2} \\frac{\\tau_c\\tau_A\\tau_N}{\\eta\\gamma s_c}\n$$\n$$\nK_c = \\frac{(\\tau_c+\\tau_A)(\\tau_A+\\tau_N)(\\tau_N+\\tau_c)}{\\eta\\gamma s_c \\tau_c\\tau_A\\tau_N}\n$$\nThis is the final expression for the critical gain.",
