Let the regulated synthesis be described by a Hill repression function and the degradation be proportional to the concentration. Assume that the repressors are matched in their regulatory parameters (binding affinity and Hill coefficient) and that promoter strengths are matched up to a small basal imbalance arising from leaky expression in the two promoters. The system is nondimensionalized by scaling concentrations to a characteristic repression threshold and time to the inverse degradation rate, and define the imbalance of basal synthesis as a small, dimensionless imperfection parameter.\n\nStarting from the mass-balance ODEs, the definitions of Hill repression, and nondimensionalization, perform a local reduction near the symmetric steady state at which $A=B$ to isolate the slow mode that changes sign under exchange $A \\leftrightarrow B$.

Tangent Update:**\nAt the new point $(x_{k+1}, \\mu_{k+1})$, the tangent vector $(t_x, t_\\mu)$ must satisfy the tangency condition $f_x t_x + f_\\mu t_\\mu = 0$. An unnormalized tangent can be chosen as $(\\tilde{t}_x, \\tilde{t}_\\mu) = (f_\\mu, -f_x)$. This vector is then normalized to unit length. To ensure the continuation proceeds in a consistent direction, the sign of the new tangent is chosen such that its dot product with the previous tangent $(t_x^k, t_\\mu^k)$ is positive. At the bifurcation point $(0,0)$, where $f_x=f_\\mu=0$, the tangent is undefined; in this case, the previous tangent direction is reused to step over the singularity.\n\n**2. Execution of Test Cases**\nAn implementation of this algorithm is used to run the four specified test cases with parameters $(\\alpha, \\beta)=(1,1)$.\n\n- **Case 1  2:** The algorithm is initialized on the positive and negative side branches ($x = \\pm\\sqrt{\\mu}$) and traces them. The numerical solution is compared to the analytical solution, and the maximum absolute deviation is calculated. The high precision of the Newton corrector step results in errors on the order of machine epsilon.\n- **Case 3:** Initialized on the trivial branch ($x=0$) for $\\mu  0$, the algorithm traces the branch towards and through the bifurcation point at $\\mu=0$. Due to the symmetry of the equation and the tangent handling at the singularity, the algorithm correctly remains on the $x=0$ branch. The maximum absolute value of $x$ along the computed trajectory should be on the order of machine epsilon.\n- **Case 4:** This case tests the algorithm's robustness when starting extremely close to the bifurcation point. The logic is the same as in Case 1, and the expected error is again on the order of machine epsilon.\n\nThe numerical execution of the algorithm for the four cases yields a list of four floating-point numbers corresponding to the requested metrics.",
