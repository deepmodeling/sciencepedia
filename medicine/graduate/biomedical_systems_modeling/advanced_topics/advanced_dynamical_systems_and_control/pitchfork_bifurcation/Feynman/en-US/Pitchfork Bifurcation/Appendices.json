Finding the Equilibria**\n\nAn equilibrium state, denoted by $x^{\\ast}$, is a solution to the equation $x' = 0$. For the given system, this means we must solve $f(x^{\\ast}) = 0$.\nThe function is $f(x) = \\mu x + x^3$.

For real-valued solutions for $x^{\\ast}$ to exist, the right-hand side must be non-negative, which requires $-\\mu \\ge 0$, or equivalently, $\\mu \\le 0$. When this condition is met, there are two symmetric, nontrivial equilibria:\n$$\nx^{\\ast} = \\pm\\sqrt{-\\mu}\n$$\nWe denote these as $x_{+}(\\mu)$ and $x_{-}(\\mu)$:\n$$\nx_{+}(\\mu) = \\sqrt{-\\mu} \\quad (\\text{for } \\mu \\le 0)\n$$\n$$\nx_{-}(\\mu) = -\\sqrt{-\\mu} \\quad (\\text{for } \\mu \\le 0)\n$$\nIn summary, for $\\mu  0$, there is one equilibrium ($x_0=0$). At $\\mu=0$, all three equilibria coincide at $x=0$. For $\\mu  0$, there are three distinct equilibria: $x_0=0$, $x_+=\\sqrt{-\\mu}$, and $x_-=-\\sqrt{-\\mu}$. The point $\\mu=0$ is the bifurcation point where the number of equilibria changes.\n\n**2. Stability Analysis**\n\nThe linear stability of an equilibrium $x^{\\ast}$ is determined by the sign of the eigenvalue $\\lambda = f'(x^{\\ast})$. An equilibrium is stable if $\\lambda  0$ and unstable if $\\lambda  0$. First, we compute the derivative of $f(x)$:\n$$\nf'(x) = \\frac{d}{dx}(\\mu x + x^3) = \\mu + 3x^2\n$$\n\nStability of the trivial equilibrium, $x_0(\\mu) = 0$:\nThe eigenvalue, $\\lambda_0(\\mu)$, is found by evaluating $f'(x)$ at $x^{\\ast} = 0$:\n$$\n\\lambda_{0}(\\mu) = f'(0) = \\mu + 3(0)^2 = \\mu\n$$\n- If $\\mu  0$, then $\\lambda_0  0$, and the trivial equilibrium $x_0=0$ is stable.\n- If $\\mu  0$, then $\\lambda_0  0$, and the trivial equilibrium $x_0=0$ is unstable.\n- At $\\mu = 0$, $\\lambda_0 = 0$, and linear stability analysis is inconclusive. This confirms that $\\mu=0$ is a bifurcation point where the stability of the trivial solution changes.\n\nStability of the nontrivial equilibria, $x_{\\pm}(\\mu) = \\pm\\sqrt{-\\mu}$:\nThese equilibria exist for $\\mu \\le 0$. The eigenvalue, $\\lambda_{\\pm}(\\mu)$, is found by evaluating $f'(x)$ at $x^{\\ast} = x_{\\pm}$:\n$$\n\\lambda_{\\pm}(\\mu) = f'(x_{\\pm}) = \\mu + 3(x_{\\pm})^2\n$$\nSubstituting $(x_{\\pm})^2 = (\\pm\\sqrt{-\\mu})^2 = -\\mu$:\n$$\n\\lambda_{\\pm}(\\mu) = \\mu + 3(-\\mu) = -2\\mu\n$$\nThis eigenvalue is the same for both $x_{+}$ and $x_{-}$. The stability depends on the sign of $-2\\mu$ for the region of existence, $\\mu \\le 0$.\n- If $\\mu  0$, then $-2\\mu  0$, which means $\\lambda_{\\pm}  0$. Therefore, both nontrivial equilibria $x_{\\pm}$ are unstable.\n- If $\\mu = 0$, then $\\lambda_{\\pm} = 0$, coinciding with the eigenvalue of the trivial branch at the bifurcation point.\n\n**3. Bifurcation Classification**\n\nAt the bifurcation point $\\mu=0$, the trivial equilibrium $x_0=0$ goes from being stable (for $\\mu  0$) to unstable (for $\\mu  0$). As this loss of stability occurs, two unstable branches, $x_{\\pm}(\\mu)$, emerge for $\\mu  0$. A bifurcation where a single stable branch becomes unstable and spawns two unstable branches is known as a **subcritical pitchfork bifurcation**. The given ODE, $x' = \\mu x + x^3$, is the normal form for this type of bifurcation. The symmetry-breaking branches $x_{\\pm}$ are unstable at their onset.\n\n**4.
