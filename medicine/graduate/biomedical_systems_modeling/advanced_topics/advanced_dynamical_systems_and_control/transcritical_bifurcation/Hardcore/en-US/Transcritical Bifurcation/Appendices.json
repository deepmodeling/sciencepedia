A full solution will be developed.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe analysis proceeds in three parts as requested: derivation of the solution $x(t)$, equilibrium and stability analysis, and analysis of the long-term dynamics and bifurcation.\n\n**Part 1: Derivation of the Closed-Form Solution for $x(t)$**\n\nThe governing ordinary differential equation is:\n$$\n\\frac{dx}{dt} = \\mu x - x^2 = x(\\mu - x)\n$$\nThis is a separable differential equation. We consider two cases based on the parameter $\\mu$.\n\n**Case 1: $\\mu \\neq 0$**\n\nWe separate variables, assuming $x \\neq 0$ and $x \\neq \\mu$. Given $x_0  0$, the solution cannot spontaneously become $0$ in finite time unless it is an equilibrium point.\n$$\n\\frac{dx}{x(\\mu-x)} = dt\n$$\nThe left-hand side is integrated using partial fraction decomposition. We seek constants $A$ and $B$ such that:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{x(\\mu-x)} = \\frac{A}{x} + \\frac{B}{\\mu-x}\n$$\nMultiplying by $x(\\mu-x)$ gives $1 = A(\\mu-x) + Bx$.\nSetting $x=0$ yields $1 = A\\mu$, so $A = \\frac{1}{\\mu}$.\nSetting $x=\\mu$ yields $1 = B\\mu$, so $B = \\frac{1}{\\mu}$.\nThus, the differential equation becomes:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{\\mu}\\left(\\frac{1}{x} + \\frac{1}{\\mu-x}\\right)dx = dt\n$$\nIntegrating both sides, we obtain:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{\\mu} \\int \\left(\\frac{1}{x} + \\frac{1}{\\mu-x}\\right)dx = \\int dt\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{1}{\\mu} (\\ln|x| - \\ln|\\mu-x|) = t + C\n$$\nwhere $C$ is the constant of integration. We can simplify the logarithmic terms:\n$$\n\\ln\\left|\\frac{x}{\\mu-x}\\right| = \\mu t + \\mu C\n$$\nExponentiating both sides gives:\n$$\n\\left|\\frac{x}{\\mu-x}\\right| = \\exp(\\mu t + \\mu C) = C_1 \\exp(\\mu t)\n$$\nwhere $C_1 = \\exp(\\mu C)$ is a positive constant. We can absorb the absolute value into the constant, letting $C_2 = \\pm C_1$ be any non-zero constant:\n$$\n\\frac{x}{\\mu-x} = C_2 \\exp(\\mu t)\n$$\nNow, we apply the initial condition $x(0) = x_0$ to find $C_2$. This assumes $x_0 \\neq \\mu$.\n$$\n\\frac{x_0}{\\mu-x_0} = C_2 \\exp(0) \\implies C_2 = \\frac{x_0}{\\mu-x_0}\n$$\nSubstituting this back into the solution for $x(t)$:\n$$\n\\frac{x(t)}{\\mu-x(t)} = \\frac{x_0}{\\mu-x_0}\\exp(\\mu t)\n$$\nWe solve for $x(t)$:\n$$\nx(t) = (\\mu-x(t))\\frac{x_0}{\\mu-x_0}\\exp(\\mu t)\n$$\n$$\nx(t)\\left(1 + \\frac{x_0}{\\mu-x_0}\\exp(\\mu t)\\right) = \\mu \\frac{x_0}{\\mu-x_0}\\exp(\\mu t)\n$$\n$$\nx(t)\\left(\\frac{\\mu-x_0+x_0\\exp(\\mu t)}{\\mu-x_0}\\right) = \\mu \\frac{x_0}{\\mu-x_0}\\exp(\\mu t)\n$$\n$$\nx(t) = \\frac{\\mu x_0 \\exp(\\mu t)}{\\mu-x_0+x_0\\exp(\\mu t)}\n$$\nTo obtain a more convenient form, we divide the numerator and denominator by $\\exp(\\mu t)$:\n$$\nx(t) = \\frac{\\mu x_0}{(\\mu-x_0)\\exp(-\\mu t)+x_0}\n$$\nThis expression is valid for $\\mu \\neq 0$. If $x_0 = \\mu$, direct inspection of the ODE shows $\\dot{x}=0$, so $x(t)=\\mu$ for all $t$. Our derived formula yields $\\frac{\\mu^2}{0 \\cdot \\exp(-\\mu t) + \\mu} = \\mu$, so it is also valid for the case $x_0 = \\mu$.\n\n**Case 2: $\\mu = 0$**\n\nIf $\\mu = 0$, the ODE simplifies to:\n$$\n\\frac{dx}{dt} = -x^2\n$$\nSeparating variables for $x \\neq 0$:\n$$\n-\\frac{dx}{x^2} = dt\n$$\nIntegrating both sides:\n$$\n\\int -\\frac{1}{x^2}dx = \\int dt\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{1}{x} = t + C\n$$\nApplying the initial condition $x(0) = x_0$:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{x_0} = 0 + C \\implies C = \\frac{1}{x_0}\n$$\nSubstituting $C$ back and solving for $x(t)$:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{x(t)} = t + \\frac{1}{x_0} = \\frac{x_0 t + 1}{x_0}\n$$\n$$\nx(t) = \\frac{x_0}{1+x_0 t}\n$$\nThis expression is valid for $\\mu = 0$.\n\n**Part 2: Equilibria and Stability Analysis**\n\nThe equilibria, or fixed points $x^*$, of the system are found by setting $\\dot{x}=0$.\n$$\nf(x^*) = \\mu x^* - (x^*)^2 = x^*(\\mu - x^*) = 0\n$$\nThis yields two equilibria:\n$$\nx_1^* = 0 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad x_2^* = \\mu\n$$\nLinear stability is determined by the sign of the derivative $f'(x^*) = \\frac{df}{dx}|_{x=x^*}$. If $f'(x^*)0$, the equilibrium is stable. If $f'(x^*)0$, it is unstable. If $f'(x^*)=0$, the analysis is inconclusive.\nThe derivative of $f(x)$ is:\n$$\nf'(x) = \\frac{d}{dx}(\\mu x - x^2) = \\mu - 2x\n$$\nWe evaluate the stability of each equilibrium:\n-   **For $x_1^* = 0$**: $f'(0) = \\mu - 2(0) = \\mu$.\n    -   If $\\mu  0$, $f'(0)  0$, so $x_1^*=0$ is a **stable** equilibrium.\n    -   If $\\mu  0$, $f'(0)  0$, so $x_1^*=0$ is an **unstable** equilibrium.\n-   **For $x_2^* = \\mu$**: $f'(\\mu) = \\mu - 2\\mu = -\\mu$.\n    -   If $\\mu  0$, $f'(\\mu)  0$, so $x_2^*=\\mu$ is an **unstable** equilibrium.\n    -   If $\\mu  0$, $f'(\\mu)  0$, so $x_2^*=\\mu$ is a **stable** equilibrium.\n-   **At $\\mu = 0$**: The two equilibria coincide, $x_1^* = x_2^* = 0$. The linear stability analysis fails because $f'(0)=0$. In this case, $\\dot{x} = -x^2$. For any $x  0$, $\\dot{x}  0$, and for any $x  0$, $\\dot{x}  0$. Trajectories approach the equilibrium from the right ($x0$) and move away from it on the left ($x0$). This is a **semi-stable** equilibrium.\n\n**Part 3: Long-Time Limit and Bifurcation Analysis**\n\nWe now determine the long-time limit $\\lim_{t\\to\\infty} x(t)$ using the explicit solutions, which must be consistent with the stability analysis. We are given $x_0  0$.\n\n-   **Regime $\\mu  0$**:\n    Using $x(t) = \\frac{\\mu x_0}{x_0 + (\\mu-x_0)\\exp(-\\mu t)}$, as $t \\to \\infty$, the term $\\exp(-\\mu t) \\to 0$ since $\\mu  0$.\n    $$\n    \\lim_{t\\to\\infty} x(t) = \\frac{\\mu x_0}{x_0 + (\\mu-x_0) \\cdot 0} = \\frac{\\mu x_0}{x_0} = \\mu\n    $$\n    This is consistent with our finding that for $\\mu0$, $x^*=\\mu$ is the stable equilibrium.\n\n-   **Regime $\\mu  0$**:\n    In this case, $-\\mu  0$. As $t \\to \\infty$, the term $\\exp(-\\mu t) \\to \\infty$.\n    $$\n    \\lim_{t\\to\\infty} x(t) = \\lim_{t\\to\\infty} \\frac{\\mu x_0}{x_0 + (\\mu-x_0)\\exp(-\\mu t)} = 0\n    $$\n    since the denominator grows without bound. This is consistent with our finding that for $\\mu0$, $x^*=0$ is the stable equilibrium.\n\n-   **Regime $\\mu = 0$**:\n    Using $x(t) = \\frac{x_0}{1+x_0 t}$, as $t \\to \\infty$, the denominator $1+x_0 t \\to \\infty$ since $x_00$.\n    $$\n    \\lim_{t\\to\\infty} x(t) = \\lim_{t\\to\\infty} \\frac{x_0}{1+x_0 t} = 0\n    $$\n    This is consistent with the semi-stable nature of the equilibrium at $x^*=0$; for any initial condition $x_0  0$, the trajectory approaches $0$.\n\n**Connection to Transcritical Bifurcation:**\n\nA transcritical bifurcation is characterized by the collision of two equilibria, which then exchange stability as a control parameter passes through a critical value.\nIn this model, the control parameter is $\\mu$ and the critical value is $\\mu_c = 0$.\nThe two equilibrium branches are $x_1^*=0$ and $x_2^*=\\mu$.\n-   For $\\mu  0$: The equilibrium at $x^*=0$ is stable, while the equilibrium at $x^*=\\mu$ is unstable.

The system's long-term state switches to $x=\\mu$.\n-   At $\\mu = 0$: The two equilibria collide at $x^*=0$.\n\nThis exchange of stability between the $x^*=0$ branch and the $x^*=\\mu$ branch as $\\mu$ passes through $0$ is the defining feature of a transcritical bifurcation. In the context of the synthetic gene circuit, this model describes a biological switch. For $\\mu  0$ (net loss rate), the gene product concentration is zero at steady state (the gene is \"off\"). When $\\mu$ becomes positive (net synthesis rate), the zero-concentration state becomes unstable, and the system switches to a new stable state with a non-zero concentration $x^*=\\mu$ (the gene is \"on\"). The bifurcation at $\\mu=0$ is the critical point for this switching behavior.",

            "solution": "The problem requires the numerical verification of the nondegeneracy conditions for a transcritical bifurcation at the origin $(x, \\mu) = (0, 0)$ for a dynamical system described by the ordinary differential equation $\\frac{dx}{dt} = f(x,\\mu;k)$. The nondegeneracy conditions are given by $f_{x\\mu}(0,0) \\neq 0$ and $f_{xx}(0,0) \\neq 0$, where subscripts denote partial derivatives. The function $f$ itself is not given in a closed form for analysis; instead, it must be estimated from a simulated explicit Euler step.\n\nThe algorithmic approach comprises three main stages: first, defining a numerical estimator for the function $f(x, \\mu; k)$; second, using this estimator within finite difference formulas to approximate the partial derivatives $f_{xx}(0,0)$ and $f_{x\\mu}(0,0)$; and third, applying a tolerance $\\epsilon$ to the magnitudes of these estimated derivatives to test the nondegeneracy conditions.\n\nThe first stage is the estimation of the function $f(x,\\mu;k)$. The problem provides access to the system's dynamics through a simulator that performs a single explicit Euler step. For an initial condition $x(0) = x_0$, the state at time $\\Delta t$ is given by:\n$$ x(\\Delta t) = x_0 + \\Delta t \\cdot f(x_0, \\mu; k) $$\nBy algebraically rearranging this equation, we can construct an estimator for the function $f$ at the point $(x_0, \\mu)$:\n$$ \\hat{f}(x_0, \\mu; k) = \\frac{x(\\Delta t) - x_0}{\\Delta t} $$\nThe problem specifies that the underlying dynamics, used by the simulator, follow the model $f(x,\\mu;k) = \\mu x - k x^2$. While our algorithm must not use this analytical form to compute derivatives, we must use it to define the simulator. Substituting this into the Euler step gives:\n$$ x(\\Delta t) = x_0 + \\Delta t (\\mu x_0 - k x_0^2) $$\nThis function represents the simulation oracle from which we estimate $f$.\n\nThe second stage is the numerical approximation of partial derivatives. We employ central finite difference formulas to estimate the second-order and mixed partial derivatives at the bifurcation point $(x, \\mu) = (0, 0)$, using small symmetric perturbations $h_x$ and $h_\\mu$. The approximation of $f_{xx}(0,0)$ uses the three-point central difference formula:\n$$ f_{xx}(0,0) \\approx \\frac{\\hat{f}(h_x, 0; k) - 2\\hat{f}(0, 0; k) + \\hat{f}(-h_x, 0; k)}{h_x^2} $$\nThe required function values are obtained through our estimator $\\hat{f}$: $\\hat{f}(h_x, 0; k)$ is computed by simulating from $x(0) = h_x$ with $\\mu=0$; $\\hat{f}(0, 0; k)$ is computed from $x(0) = 0$ with $\\mu=0$; and $\\hat{f}(-h_x, 0; k)$ is computed from $x(0) = -h_x$ with $\\mu=0$. The approximation of $f_{x\\mu}(0,0)$ uses the four-point central difference formula:\n$$ f_{x\\mu}(0,0) \\approx \\frac{\\hat{f}(h_x, h_\\mu; k) - \\hat{f}(h_x, -h_\\mu; k) - \\hat{f}(-h_x, h_\\mu; k) + \\hat{f}(-h_x, -h_\\mu; k)}{4 h_x h_\\mu} $$\nThis requires four evaluations of our function estimator $\\hat{f}$ at the corners of a small rectangle centered at the origin in the $(x, \\mu)$ plane. For instance, $\\hat{f}(h_x, h_\\mu; k)$ is computed by simulating from the initial condition $x(0) = h_x$ with the parameter value $\\mu = h_\\mu$.\n\nThe third and final stage is the nondegeneracy test. With the numerical estimates for the derivatives, denoted $\\hat{f}_{xx}(0,0)$ and $\\hat{f}_{x\\mu}(0,0)$, the nondegeneracy conditions are tested against a given positive tolerance $\\epsilon$. The test is declared satisfied if and only if both of the following inequalities hold:\n$$ |\\hat{f}_{xx}(0,0)| > \\epsilon \\quad \\text{and} \\quad |\\hat{f}_{x\\mu}(0,0)| > \\epsilon $$\nThis procedure is then applied to each of the provided test cases. For the given underlying function $f(x, \\mu; k) = \\mu x - k x^2$, the true derivatives are $f_{xx}(0,0) = -2k$ and $f_{x\\mu}(0,0) = 1$. Our numerical estimates should be exceptionally close to these analytical values because the finite difference formulas are exact for polynomials of low degree. The test for nondegeneracy effectively becomes a check on whether $|-2k| > \\epsilon$ and $|1| > \\epsilon$. Given $\\epsilon$ is small (e.g., $10^{-6}$), the second condition is practically always met, and the test hinges on whether the parameter $k$ is sufficiently large in magnitude.",
