This first exercise  challenges you to find the critical parameter value where a system's equilibria appear, using the core principle that a bifurcation occurs when the system's rate of change and its derivative with respect to the state variable are simultaneously zero.

            "problem": "A simplified model for the population dynamics of a certain microbe species is given by the differential equation:\n$$ \\frac{dx}{dt} = r \\ln(x) - x $$\nHere, $x(t)$ represents the population density, which must be positive ($x > 0$). The parameter $r$ is a positive, dimensionless external control constant related to nutrient availability.\n\nThe number of stable, non-changing population densities, known as equilibrium states, is dependent on the value of $r$. Below a certain critical value of this parameter, $r_c$, no equilibrium states are possible, leading to the population's extinction. At the critical value $r_c$, exactly one equilibrium state exists. Above this value, two distinct equilibrium states appear.\n\nDetermine the exact analytical expression for this critical parameter value, $r_c$.",
            "solution": "An equilibrium state, or fixed point, of the system is a value of the population density $x$ for which the population does not change over time. Mathematically, this corresponds to the condition $\\frac{dx}{dt} = 0$.\n\nLet the function describing the rate of change be $f(x, r) = r \\ln(x) - x$. Setting this function to zero gives the equation for the equilibrium points:\n$$r \\ln(x) - x = 0$$\n\nWe are looking for the critical value of the parameter, $r_c$, at which the number of solutions for $x$ in this equation changes. This transition point occurs when the system has exactly one solution for $x$. In general, for a system $\\dot{x} = f(x)$, a bifurcation where fixed points merge occurs when the conditions $f(x) = 0$ and $\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x} = 0$ are satisfied simultaneously for the same value of $x$. This is because at the merging point, the curve of $f(x)$ becomes tangent to the $x$-axis, implying a root with zero slope.\n\nSo, we must solve the following system of two equations for the critical values $x_c$ and $r_c$:\n1. $f(x_c, r_c) = r_c \\ln(x_c) - x_c = 0$\n2. $\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x}\\bigg|_{(x_c, r_c)} = 0$\n\nLet's first compute the partial derivative of $f(x, r)$ with respect to $x$:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} (r \\ln(x) - x) = \\frac{r}{x} - 1 $$\nNow we set this derivative to zero to satisfy the second condition:\n$$ \\frac{r_c}{x_c} - 1 = 0 $$\nSolving for $r_c$ in terms of $x_c$, we find:\n$$ r_c = x_c $$\nThis relationship tells us that at the bifurcation point, the parameter value is equal to the equilibrium population density.\n\nNext, we substitute this relationship, $r_c = x_c$, into the first equation, $r_c \\ln(x_c) - x_c = 0$:\n$$ x_c \\ln(x_c) - x_c = 0 $$\nWe can factor out $x_c$:\n$$ x_c (\\ln(x_c) - 1) = 0 $$\nThe problem statement specifies that the population density must be positive, so $x_c > 0$. This allows us to divide both sides by $x_c$, which yields:\n$$ \\ln(x_c) - 1 = 0 $$\nSolving for $\\ln(x_c)$:\n$$ \\ln(x_c) = 1 $$\nTo find $x_c$, we exponentiate both sides:\n$$ x_c = e^{1} = e $$\nThis is the population density at the critical point.\n\nFinally, to find the critical parameter value $r_c$, we use the relationship we found earlier, $r_c = x_c$.\nSubstituting the value of $x_c = e$, we get:\n$$ r_c = e $$\nThus, the critical value of the parameter $r$ is $e$. For $r > e$, there are two equilibrium solutions; for $r = e$, there is one; and for $0  r  e$, there are no real solutions for the equilibrium state, leading to population collapse.",

            "introduction": "Moving from pure mathematics to biological interpretation, our next practice explores the meaning of the fixed points created in a saddle-node bifurcation. The unstable fixed point, which emerges alongside a stable one, is not just a mathematical curiosity; it has a profound biological significance. This problem  asks you to identify this role, helping you connect the abstract phase portrait to the tangible concept of a 'tipping point' that governs population survival or collapse.",

            "problem": "In the study of population dynamics, a simple model can be used to describe a system that undergoes a sudden catastrophic shift. Consider a population of a certain species whose size, $N$, changes over time $t$ according to the following differential equation:\n$$ \\frac{dN}{dt} = h + rN - N^{2} $$\nHere, $N$ represents the population density, which must be non-negative. The parameter $r > 0$ is the intrinsic growth rate of the population, while the $-N^{2}$ term represents mortality due to intra-species competition. The parameter $h$ represents a constant rate of immigration into the population from an external source.\n\nFor certain values of the parameters $h$ and $r$, this system exhibits a saddle-node bifurcation. Specifically, as the immigration rate $h$ is increased from a large negative value (representing a high emigration or death rate not related to population density), the system transitions from having no viable population (no steady states) to having two distinct non-negative steady states. One of these steady states is stable, representing a viable, self-sustaining population level. The other steady state is unstable.\n\nWhich of the following provides the most accurate biological interpretation of this unstable steady state?\n\nA. It represents the maximum possible population size, or carrying capacity, beyond which the population experiences a rapid decline.\n\nB. It represents a critical threshold or \"tipping point\" population size. If the population falls below this value, it will inevitably decline to extinction, but if it is above this value, it will grow towards the stable, viable population level.\n\nC. It represents the population size at which the population's per capita growth rate is at its maximum.\n\nD. It represents an average population size around which the actual population level will oscillate indefinitely due to seasonal changes.\n\nE.

Therefore:\n- If $N(0)  N_{-}$, then $dN/dt0$ and $N(t)$ declines toward extinction.\n- If $N(0) > N_{-}$ but below $N_{+}$, then $dN/dt>0$ and $N(t)$ grows toward the stable equilibrium $N_{+}$.\n\nThus the unstable equilibrium $N_{-}$ acts as a critical threshold or tipping point: crossing it determines whether the population goes extinct or recovers to the viable stable state. In a one-dimensional autonomous system, there are no sustained oscillations, so the interpretation in terms of oscillations is invalid. The carrying capacity in this context corresponds to the stable upper equilibrium $N_{+}$, not the unstable one. The per capita growth rate $(h + rN - N^{2})/N$ is not maximized at the unstable equilibrium in general. At equilibrium $h + rN - N^{2}=0$, immigration $h$ explicitly enters, so it is not independent of immigration.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate biological interpretation of the unstable steady state is as a tipping point threshold separating extinction from recovery to the stable population.",
