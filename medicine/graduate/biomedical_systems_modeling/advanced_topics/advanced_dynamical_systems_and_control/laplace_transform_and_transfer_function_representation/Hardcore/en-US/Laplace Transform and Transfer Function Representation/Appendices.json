The system is to be treated as linear time-invariant (LTI), and the initial condition is specified as zero, i.e., $c(0^-)=0$. The objective is to derive the transfer function $G(s)$ that maps the input $U(s)$ to the output $C(s)$, and to identify the pole of this transfer function. The transfer function is defined as $G(s) = \\frac{C(s)}{U(s)}$ under zero initial conditions, where $C(s)$ and $U(s)$ are the unilateral Laplace transforms of $c(t)$ and $u(t)$, respectively.\n\nThe derivation proceeds by applying the unilateral Laplace transform, denoted by $\\mathcal{L}\\{\\cdot\\}$, to both sides of the governing ODE.\n$$\n\\mathcal{L}\\left\\{\\frac{dc(t)}{dt}\\right\\}(s) = \\mathcal{L}\\{-k\\,c(t)+u(t)\\}(s)\n$$\nBy the linearity property of the Laplace transform, the right-hand side can be written as:\n$$\n\\mathcal{L}\\{-k\\,c(t)+u(t)\\}(s) = -k\\,\\mathcal{L}\\{c(t)\\}(s) + \\mathcal{L}\\{u(t)\\}(s)\n$$\nLet us denote the Laplace transform of $c(t)$ as $C(s)$ and the Laplace transform of $u(t)$ as $U(s)$.

Observability Analysis**\nA system is observable if its observability matrix $\\mathcal{O}$ has full rank, i.e., $\\text{rank}(\\mathcal{O}) = n$. The observability matrix is defined as:\n$$\n\\mathcal{O} = \\begin{pmatrix} C \\\\ CA \\\\ CA^2 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nFirst, we compute the matrix products $CA$ and $CA^2$.\n$$\nC = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\n$$\nCA = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n- a_{1} & a_{2} & 0 \\\\\nb_{1} & - b_{2} & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & -k\n\\end{pmatrix} =\n\\begin{pmatrix} -a_{1} & a_{2} & 0 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\n$$\nCA^2 = (CA)A = \\begin{pmatrix} -a_{1} & a_{2} & 0 \\end{pmatrix}\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n- a_{1} & a_{2} & 0 \\\\\nb_{1} & - b_{2} & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & -k\n\\end{pmatrix} =\n\\begin{pmatrix} a_{1}^2+a_{2}b_{1} & -a_{1}a_{2}-a_{2}b_{2} & 0 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe observability matrix $\\mathcal{O}$ is thus:\n$$\n\\mathcal{O} = \\begin{pmatrix}\n1 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n-a_{1} & a_{2} & 0 \\\\\na_{1}^2+a_{2}b_{1} & -a_{1}a_{2}-a_{2}b_{2} & 0\n\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe third column of $\\mathcal{O}$ is a zero vector.

The state $x_3(t)$ does not affect the output $y(t) = x_1(t)$. This is evident from the output equation itself.\n\n**3. Controllability, Observability, and Minimality**\nA state-space realization $\\{A, B, C, D\\}$ of order $n$ is defined as **minimal** if it has the smallest possible state dimension $n$ that can produce a given input-output transfer function $G(s)$. A fundamental theorem of linear systems theory states that a realization is minimal if and only if it is both completely controllable and completely observable.\n\n- **Controllability** relates to whether the system's states can be influenced by the input $u(t)$. An uncontrollable state or mode evolves according to its own dynamics, independent of any control action. In the transfer function, this corresponds to a pole of the system that is cancelled by a zero, making that dynamic mode \"disappear\" from the input-output relationship.\n- **Observability** relates to whether the system's states can be inferred from the output $y(t)$. An unobservable state or mode evolves without any effect on the measured output. In the transfer function, this also corresponds to a pole that is cancelled by a zero, making that dynamic mode \"hidden\" from the output.\n\nThe Kalman decomposition theorem shows that any linear time-invariant system's state space can be decomposed into four mutually exclusive subspaces: (1) controllable and observable, (2) controllable but unobservable, (3) uncontrollable but observable, and (4) uncontrollable and unobservable. The transfer function $G(s)$ only captures the dynamics of the controllable and observable subspace. Therefore, if a system is not controllable or not observable, its state-space representation is non-minimal, and its transfer function will contain pole-zero cancellations. The minimal realization corresponds to the system description after these cancellations are performed.\n\n**4. Transfer Function Derivation and Minimization**\nThe transfer function $G(s)$ for a linear time-invariant system with zero initial conditions is given by the formula:\n$$\nG(s) = Y(s)/U(s) = C(sI - A)^{-1}B + D\n$$\nGiven $D=0$, we need to compute $C(sI - A)^{-1}B$.\nFirst, we find the matrix $(sI - A)$:\n$$\nsI - A = \\begin{pmatrix} s+a_{1} & -a_{2} & 0 \\\\ -b_{1} & s+b_{2} & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & s+k \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nNext, we compute the inverse, $(sI - A)^{-1} = \\frac{1}{\\det(sI-A)}\\text{adj}(sI-A)$. The determinant is found by cofactor expansion along the third row:\n$$\n\\det(sI - A) = (s+k) \\det \\begin{pmatrix} s+a_{1} & -a_{2} \\\\ -b_{1} & s+b_{2} \\end{pmatrix} = (s+k)[(s+a_{1})(s+b_{2}) - a_{2}b_{1}]\n$$\n$$\n\\det(sI - A) = (s+k)[s^2 + (a_1+b_2)s + a_{1}b_{2} - a_{2}b_{1}]\n$$\nNow we compute the product $C \\cdot \\text{adj}(sI-A) \\cdot B$. \n$$\nY(s) = C(sI-A)^{-1}B U(s) = \\frac{1}{\\det(sI-A)} C \\cdot \\text{adj}(sI-A) \\cdot B \\cdot U(s)\n$$\n$$\nC \\cdot \\text{adj}(sI-A) = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} (s+b_2)(s+k) & a_2(s+k) & 0 \\\\ b_1(s+k) & (s+a_1)(s+k) & 0 \\\\ \\dots & \\dots & \\dots \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} (s+b_2)(s+k) & a_2(s+k) & 0 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\n$$\n[C \\cdot \\text{adj}(sI-A)] \\cdot B = \\begin{pmatrix} (s+b_2)(s+k) & a_2(s+k) & 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} b_{u} \\\\ c_{u} \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\n$$\n= b_u(s+b_2)(s+k) + c_u a_2(s+k) = (s+k)[b_u(s+b_2) + c_u a_2] = (s+k)[b_u s + b_u b_2 + c_u a_2]\n$$\nThe full transfer function is:\n$$\nG(s) = \\frac{(s+k)[b_u s + b_u b_2 + c_u a_2]}{(s+k)[s^2 + (a_1+b_2)s + a_{1}b_{2} - a_{2}b_{1}]}\n$$\nAs predicted by the controllability and observability analysis, the mode associated with the eigenvalue $\\lambda = -k$ (the pole at $s = -k$) is both uncontrollable and unobservable. This manifests as a pole-zero cancellation of the term $(s+k)$. To obtain the minimal transfer function $G_{\\min}(s)$, which describes the controllable and observable dynamics, we cancel this common factor:\n$$\nG_{\\min}(s) = \\frac{b_u s + b_u b_2 + c_u a_2}{s^2 + (a_1+b_2)s + a_1 b_2 - a_2 b_1}\n$$\nThis second-order transfer function represents the minimal realization of the system, corresponding to the dynamics of the states $x_1$ and $x_2$.",

Stability is unaffected; the zero reduces phase lead and therefore guarantees a delayed rise time but cannot change the initial direction of $y(t)$ with respect to its final value.",
            "solution": "First, we analyze the stability of the system. For a linear, time-invariant (LTI) system, bounded-input, bounded-output (BIBO) stability is determined exclusively by the locations of the poles of its transfer function, $G(s)$. The poles are the roots of the denominator polynomial. For the given transfer function, $G(s)=\\frac{s+z}{(s+p_1)(s+p_2)}$, the poles are located at $s = -p_1$ and $s = -p_2$. We are given that $p_1>0$ and $p_2>0$, which means both poles are located on the negative real axis in the complex $s$-plane. A continuous-time LTI system is BIBO stable if and only if all of its poles lie in the open left-half of the $s$-plane. Since both poles satisfy this condition, the system is asymptotically stable. The zero of the system is located at $s = -z$. Given $z<0$, the zero $s = -z$ is a positive real number, meaning it lies in the open right-half of the $s$-plane (RHP). Zeros do not affect the BIBO stability of an LTI system. A system with one or more zeros in the open RHP is known as a non-minimum-phase system.\n\nNext, we analyze the transient response of the system to a step input $u(t) = u_0\\, u(t)$, where $u_0 > 0$. The Laplace transform of the input is $U(s) = \\frac{u_0}{s}$. The Laplace transform of the output, $y(t)$, is $Y(s) = G(s)U(s)$:\n$$Y(s) = \\frac{s+z}{(s+p_1)(s+p_2)} \\cdot \\frac{u_0}{s}$$\nTo determine the initial direction of the response and its final value, we use the Initial and Final Value Theorems of the Laplace transform. The Final Value Theorem is applicable because the system is stable.\nThe final value of the output is:\n$$y(\\infty) = \\lim_{t \\to \\infty} y(t) = \\lim_{s \\to 0} sY(s) = \\lim_{s \\to 0} s \\frac{u_0(s+z)}{s(s+p_1)(s+p_2)} = \\frac{u_0(0+z)}{(0+p_1)(0+p_2)} = \\frac{u_0 z}{p_1 p_2}$$\nGiven that $u_0>0$, $p_1>0$, $p_2>0$, and $z<0$, the final value $y(\\infty)$ is negative.\n\nTo find the initial direction of the response, we first find the initial value $y(0^+)$ and then the initial slope $y'(0^+)$. The transfer function $G(s)$ is strictly proper (degree of denominator is $2$, degree of numerator is $1$), so the response to a step input will start at zero. This can be confirmed with the Initial Value Theorem:\n$$y(0^+) = \\lim_{t \\to 0^+} y(t) = \\lim_{s \\to \\infty} sY(s) = \\lim_{s \\to \\infty} \\frac{u_0(s+z)}{(s+p_1)(s+p_2)} = 0$$\nThe initial slope of the response is given by the initial value of its derivative, $y'(t)$. Using the differentiation property of the Laplace transform, $\\mathcal{L}\\{y'(t)\\} = sY(s) - y(0^-)$. Assuming the system is initially at rest, $y(0^-)=0$. Applying the Initial Value Theorem to $y'(t)$:\n$$y'(0^+) = \\lim_{t \\to 0^+} y'(t) = \\lim_{s \\to \\infty} s [sY(s)] = \\lim_{s \\to \\infty} s^2 Y(s)$$\n$$y'(0^+) = \\lim_{s \\to \\infty} s^2 \\frac{u_0(s+z)}{s(s+p_1)(s+p_2)} = \\lim_{s \\to \\infty} \\frac{u_0 s(s+z)}{(s+p_1)(s+p_2)} = \\lim_{s \\to \\infty} \\frac{u_0 s^2(1+z/s)}{s^2(1+p_1/s)(1+p_2/s)} = u_0$$\nSince $u_0>0$, the initial slope is positive. The response $y(t)$ starts at $0$ with a positive slope, but settles at a negative final value. This means the output $y(t)$ initially moves in the positive direction, opposite to its final negative value. This behavior is known as an \"inverse response\" or \"initial undershoot\" and is a defining characteristic of systems with an odd number of real RHP zeros.\n\nFinally, we consider the concept of overshoot. For a standard second-order system with two real, distinct poles and no zeros, the step response is always monotonic and cannot exhibit overshoot. The presence of the RHP zero fundamentally alters this behavior, introducing non-monotonicity. The \"inverse response\" itself is a dramatic form of non-monotonic behavior. The output moves in one direction, then reverses to settle in the opposite direction. This excursion into the \"wrong\" direction can be classified as a form of overshoot, as the response significantly deviates from a simple monotonic path to its final value. Therefore, the RHP zero *enables* this non-monotonic, overshooting-type behavior even though the poles are real and distinct.\n\nNow we evaluate each option:\n\nA. The zero at $s=-z>0$ does not affect asymptotic stability; stability is determined solely by the poles at $s=-p_1$ and $s=-p_2$. Because $-z>0$, the system is non-minimum-phase, which causes the unit-step concentration deviation $y(t)$ to initially move opposite to its final sign and enables a transient overshoot in magnitude even with real, distinct poles.\nThis statement is entirely consistent with our derivation and is **Correct**.\n\nB. The right-half-plane zero renders the system unstable; any non-minimum-phase zero causes $y(t)$ to diverge under a unit-step input.\nThis statement is **Incorrect**. BIBO stability is determined by the poles, not the zeros. The poles are in the LHP, so the system is stable.\n\nC. The zero does not affect stability; however, with two real poles the step response must be strictly monotonic, so overshoot cannot occur regardless of the zero location.\nThis statement is **Incorrect**. A RHP zero causes a non-monotonic inverse response, contradicting the claim of strict monotonicity.\n\nD. The zero shifts the poles into the right half-plane via pole-zero interaction, making stability depend on the value of $z$; overshoot arises only if the poles are complex-conjugate.\nThis statement is **Incorrect**. In an open-loop system, poles and zeros are fixed. Also, overshoot-like behavior (inverse response) can occur with real poles due to the RHP zero.\n\nE. Stability is unaffected; the zero reduces phase lead and therefore guarantees a delayed rise time but cannot change the initial direction of $y(t)$ with respect to its final value.\nThis statement is **Incorrect**. The RHP zero is precisely the reason the initial direction is opposite to the final value.",
