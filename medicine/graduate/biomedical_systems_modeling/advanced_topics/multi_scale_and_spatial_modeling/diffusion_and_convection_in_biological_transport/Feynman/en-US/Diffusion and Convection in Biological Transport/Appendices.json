The PDE reduces to a second-order linear ordinary differential equation (ODE) with constant coefficients:\n$$\nD \\frac{d^2 c}{dx^2} - v \\frac{dc}{dx} - k c = 0\n$$\nTo solve this ODE, we assume a solution of the form $c(x) = e^{rx}$ and substitute it into the equation, which yields the characteristic equation:\n$$\nD r^2 - v r - k = 0\n$$\nThe roots of this quadratic equation are given by the quadratic formula:\n$$\nr = \\frac{-(-v) \\pm \\sqrt{(-v)^2 - 4(D)(-k)}}{2D} = \\frac{v \\pm \\sqrt{v^2 + 4Dk}}{2D}\n$$\nLet the two distinct real roots be $r_1$ and $r_2$:\n$$\nr_1 = \\frac{v + \\sqrt{v^2 + 4Dk}}{2D} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad r_2 = \\frac{v - \\sqrt{v^2 + 4Dk}}{2D}\n$$\nSince $v>0$, $D>0$, and $k>0$, the term $\\sqrt{v^2 + 4Dk}$ is real and greater than $v$. Consequently, $r_1 > 0$ and $r_2 < 0$.\nThe general solution to the ODE is a linear combination of the two exponential solutions:\n$$\nc(x) = C_1 e^{r_1 x} + C_2 e^{r_2 x}\n$$\nwhere $C_1$ and $C_2$ are constants to be determined by the boundary conditions.\n\n### Application of Boundary Conditions\n\n1.  **Boundary condition at $x \\to \\infty$**: The problem states that the concentration must remain finite as $x \\to \\infty$. Since $r_1 > 0$, the term $e^{r_1 x}$ grows without bound as $x \\to \\infty$. To keep the concentration finite, the coefficient $C_1$ must be zero. Thus, the solution simplifies to:\n    $$\n    c(x) = C_2 e^{r_2 x}\n    $$\n2.  **Boundary condition at $x=0$**: The condition at the inlet is a flux balance, often called a Danckwerts boundary condition. The flux entering the conduit from the purely advective upstream reservoir is $v c_{\\mathrm{in}}$. This must equal the total advective and diffusive flux just inside the conduit at $x=0^+$.\n    $$\n    \\text{Flux at } x=0^- = \\text{Flux at } x=0^+\n    $$\n    $$\n    v c_{\\mathrm{in}} = \\left. \\left( v c(x) - D \\frac{dc}{dx} \\right) \\right|_{x=0}\n    $$\n    We have $c(x) = C_2 e^{r_2 x}$, so $c(0) = C_2$. The derivative is $\\frac{dc}{dx} = C_2 r_2 e^{r_2 x}$, so $\\left. \\frac{dc}{dx} \\right|_{x=0} = C_2 r_2$. Substituting these into the boundary condition gives:\n    $$\n    v c_{\\mathrm{in}} = v C_2 - D (C_2 r_2) = C_2 (v - D r_2)\n    $$\n    Now we solve for the constant $C_2$:\n    $$\n    C_2 = \\frac{v c_{\\mathrm{in}}}{v - D r_2}\n    $$\n    Let's substitute the expression for $r_2$:\n    $$\n    v - D r_2 = v - D \\left( \\frac{v - \\sqrt{v^2 + 4Dk}}{2D} \\right) = v - \\frac{v - \\sqrt{v^2 + 4Dk}}{2}\n    $$\n    $$\n    v - D r_2 = \\frac{2v - (v - \\sqrt{v^2 + 4Dk})}{2} = \\frac{v + \\sqrt{v^2 + 4Dk}}{2}\n    $$\n    Substituting this back into the expression for $C_2$:\n    $$\n    C_2 = \\frac{v c_{\\mathrm{in}}}{\\frac{v + \\sqrt{v^2 + 4Dk}}{2}} = \\frac{2v c_{\\mathrm{in}}}{v + \\sqrt{v^2 + 4Dk}}\n    $$\n    \n### Final Expression for the Concentration Profile\n\nFinally, we substitute the expressions for $C_2$ and $r_2$ back into the solution $c(x) = C_2 e^{r_2 x}$ to obtain the explicit steady-state concentration profile:\n$$\nc(x) = \\left( \\frac{2v c_{\\mathrm{in}}}{v + \\sqrt{v^2 + 4Dk}} \\right) \\exp\\left( \\left( \\frac{v - \\sqrt{v^2 + 4Dk}}{2D} \\right) x \\right)\n$$\nThis is the closed-form analytic expression for the steady-state concentration $c(x)$ for $x \\geq 0$.",

The derivatives become:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial c}{\\partial x} = \\frac{c_s - c_{\\infty}}{L} \\frac{\\partial \\theta}{\\partial X} $$\n$$ \\frac{\\partial^2 c}{\\partial y^2} = (c_s - c_{\\infty}) \\frac{\\partial^2 \\theta}{\\partial Y^2} \\left(\\frac{dY}{dy}\\right)^2 = \\frac{c_s - c_{\\infty}}{\\delta^2} \\frac{\\partial^2 \\theta}{\\partial Y^2} $$\nSubstituting into $U\\frac{\\partial c}{\\partial x} = D\\frac{\\partial^2 c}{\\partial y^2}$:\n$$ U \\frac{c_s - c_{\\infty}}{L} \\frac{\\partial \\theta_{inner}}{\\partial X} = D \\frac{c_s - c_{\\infty}}{\\delta^2} \\frac{\\partial^2 \\theta_{inner}}{\\partial Y^2} $$\n$$ \\frac{\\partial \\theta_{inner}}{\\partial X} = \\frac{DL}{U\\delta^2} \\frac{\\partial^2 \\theta_{inner}}{\\partial Y^2} $$\nExpressing this in terms of $\\mathrm{Pe}$ and $\\Delta$:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial \\theta_{inner}}{\\partial X} = \\frac{DL}{U(L\\Delta)^2} \\frac{\\partial^2 \\theta_{inner}}{\\partial Y^2} = \\left(\\frac{D}{UL}\\right) \\frac{1}{\\Delta^2} \\frac{\\partial^2 \\theta_{inner}}{\\partial Y^2} = \\frac{1}{\\mathrm{Pe} \\cdot \\Delta^2} \\frac{\\partial^2 \\theta_{inner}}{\\partial Y^2} $$\nThe problem requires us to enforce a dominant balance in this inner region that allows for both nontrivial axial evolution ($\\frac{\\partial \\theta_{inner}}{\\partial X} \\sim O(1)$) and transverse diffusion ($\\frac{\\partial^2 \\theta_{inner}}{\\partial Y^2} \\sim O(1)$) at leading order. For these two terms to be of the same order of magnitude, their coefficients must balance. This implies that the coefficient group multiplying the diffusion term must be of order unity:\n$$ \\frac{1}{\\mathrm{Pe} \\cdot \\Delta^2} \\sim O(1) $$\nThis establishes the scaling relationship for the dimensionless boundary layer thickness $\\Delta$:\n$$ \\Delta^2 \\sim \\frac{1}{\\mathrm{Pe}} $$\nTaking the square root gives the leading-order asymptotic expression for $\\Delta$:\n$$ \\Delta = \\mathrm{Pe}^{-\\frac{1}{2}} $$\nThis scaling is characteristic of boundary layers where convection is balanced by diffusion in the direction normal to the flow. The resulting leading-order inner equation becomes $\\frac{\\partial \\theta_{inner}}{\\partial X} = \\frac{\\partial^2 \\theta_{inner}}{\\partial Y^2}$, which is a well-posed parabolic problem describing the development of the concentration profile within the boundary layer. The expression found for $\\Delta$ represents the characteristic dimensionless thickness of this layer, evaluated over the length $L$ of the slab.",
