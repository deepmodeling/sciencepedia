Assume spatially uniform equilibria for classification of local kinetics. The notions of monostable, bistable, and excitable regimes are defined by the number and stability of spatially uniform equilibria of the reaction subsystem (i.e., with $D_u=D_v=0$): monostable means a unique stable equilibrium, bistable means two stable equilibria separated by an unstable equilibrium, and excitable refers to a monostable regime with a fast-slow threshold nonlinearity that can support traveling pulses once diffusion is reinstated.\n\nStarting only from core definitions of equilibria, Jacobian linearization, and linear stability for planar systems, do the following:\n\n- Identify the spatially uniform rest state with the smallest activator value and compute the Jacobian matrix of the reaction subsystem at this rest state.\n- Determine the parameter conditions under which the reaction subsystem has one equilibrium versus three equilibria, and use linear stability to distinguish monostable versus bistable regimes.

            "solution": "The problem asks for an analysis of the spatially uniform dynamics of a Barkley-type activator-inhibitor model and the derivation of the bifurcation boundary separating monostable and bistable regimes. The analysis begins with the reaction subsystem, where the diffusion coefficients are set to zero ($D_u = 0$, $D_v = 0$).\n\nThe reaction subsystem is governed by the following system of ordinary differential equations:\n$$\n\\frac{du}{dt} = \\frac{1}{\\varepsilon}u(1-u)(u-a) - v \\equiv f(u,v)\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{dv}{dt} = u - bv \\equiv g(u,v)\n$$\nSpatially uniform equilibria, or fixed points $(u^*, v^*)$, are states where the system does not change in time, i.e., $\\frac{du}{dt}=0$ and $\\frac{dv}{dt}=0$. These conditions define the nullclines of the system.\n\nThe $v$-nullcline is found from $\\frac{dv}{dt}=0$:\n$$\nu - bv = 0 \\implies v = \\frac{u}{b}\n$$\nThis is a straight line passing through the origin with a positive slope $1/b$.\n\nThe $u$-nullcline is found from $\\frac{du}{dt}=0$:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{\\varepsilon}u(1-u)(u-a) - v = 0 \\implies v = \\frac{1}{\\varepsilon}u(1-u)(u-a)\n$$\nThis is a cubic function of $u$ with roots at $u=0$, $u=a$, and $u=1$. Since $0 < a < 1$, this cubic function has the characteristic \"N\"-shape.\n\nThe equilibria are the intersection points of these two nullclines. To find the $u$-coordinates of the equilibria, we set the expressions for $v$ equal to each other:\n$$\n\\frac{u}{b} = \\frac{1}{\\varepsilon}u(1-u)(u-a)\n$$\nThis equation can be rewritten as:\n$$\nu \\left( \\frac{1}{b} - \\frac{1}{\\varepsilon}(1-u)(u-a) \\right) = 0\n$$\nOne immediate solution is $u=0$. Substituting this into the $v$-nullcline equation, $v=u/b$, gives $v=0$. Thus, $(u,v)=(0,0)$ is always an equilibrium of the system. This corresponds to the rest state with the smallest activator value.\n\nThe first task is to compute the Jacobian matrix of the reaction subsystem at this rest state. The Jacobian matrix $J(u,v)$ is given by:\n$$\nJ(u,v) = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial u} & \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial v} \\\\ \\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial u} & \\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial v} \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe partial derivatives are:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial u} = \\frac{d}{du}\\left[\\frac{1}{\\varepsilon}(-u^3 + (1+a)u^2 - au)\\right] = \\frac{1}{\\varepsilon}(-3u^2 + 2(1+a)u - a)\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial v} = -1\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial u} = 1\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial v} = -b\n$$\nEvaluating the Jacobian at the equilibrium point $(0,0)$:\n$$\nJ(0,0) = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{1}{\\varepsilon}(-a) & -1 \\\\ 1 & -b \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} -\\frac{a}{\\varepsilon} & -1 \\\\ 1 & -b \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nTo confirm that this is a stable rest state, we analyze its linear stability. The trace ($\\tau$) and determinant ($\\Delta$) of the Jacobian are:\n$$\n\\tau = \\text{Tr}(J(0,0)) = -\\frac{a}{\\varepsilon} - b\n$$\n$$\n\\Delta = \\det(J(0,0)) = \\left(-\\frac{a}{\\varepsilon}\\right)(-b) - (-1)(1) = \\frac{ab}{\\varepsilon} + 1\n$$\nGiven the parameter constraints $a>0$, $b>0$, and $\\varepsilon>0$, the trace is always negative ($\\tau<0$) and the determinant is always positive ($\\Delta>0$). These conditions guarantee that the equilibrium at $(0,0)$ is always stable (a stable node or a stable focus).\n\nNext, we address the second task: determining the conditions for one versus three equilibria. The remaining equilibria are found from the other factor of the equilibrium equation:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{b} = \\frac{1}{\\varepsilon}(1-u)(u-a) \\implies \\frac{\\varepsilon}{b} = -u^2 + (1+a)u - a\n$$\nRearranging this into a standard quadratic form gives:\n$$\nu^2 - (1+a)u + \\left(a + \\frac{\\varepsilon}{b}\\right) = 0\n$$\nThe number of real solutions for $u$ is determined by the sign of the discriminant, $D$, of this quadratic equation:\n$$\nD = (-(1+a))^2 - 4(1)\\left(a + \\frac{\\varepsilon}{b}\\right) = (1+a)^2 - 4a - \\frac{4\\varepsilon}{b} = 1 + 2a + a^2 - 4a - \\frac{4\\varepsilon}{b}\n$$\n$$\nD = (1-a)^2 - \\frac{4\\varepsilon}{b}\n$$\nThere are three cases based on the sign of $D$:\n1.  If $D>0$, i.e., $(1-a)^2 > \\frac{4\\varepsilon}{b}$, there are two distinct real positive roots for $u$. Including the $u=0$ root, the system has a total of three equilibria. This corresponds to the **bistable regime**, where the system has two stable equilibria (the lowest one at $(0,0)$ and the highest one) separated by an unstable (saddle) equilibrium.\n2.  If $D<0$, i.e., $(1-a)^2 < \\frac{4\\varepsilon}{b}$, there are no real roots for $u$ other than $u=0$. The system has only one equilibrium, $(0,0)$. This is the **monostable regime**.\n3.  If $D=0$, i.e., $(1-a)^2 = \\frac{4\\varepsilon}{b}$, there is one real root of multiplicity two for $u \\ne 0$. This is the borderline case, corresponding to a saddle-node bifurcation.\n\nThe term **excitable regime** refers to the monostable case where the underlying fast-slow dynamics and N-shaped nullcline can produce a large transient excursion (a pulse) in response to a superthreshold perturbation, before returning to the single stable rest state. Thus, the condition for the excitable regime is the same as for the monostable regime:\n$$\n(1-a)^2 < \\frac{4\\varepsilon}{b} \\quad \\text{or equivalently} \\quad \\varepsilon > \\frac{b(1-a)^2}{4}\n$$\n\nFinally, the third task is to find the closed-form analytic expression for the codimension-one boundary in $(a,b,\\varepsilon)$-space that separates the monostable (excitable) and bistable regimes. This boundary is precisely the bifurcation point where the two nontrivial equilibria are created or annihilated. This occurs when the discriminant $D$ is zero:\n$$\nD = (1-a)^2 - \\frac{4\\varepsilon}{b} = 0\n$$\nSolving this equation for the critical value of $\\varepsilon$, denoted as $\\varepsilon_c(a,b)$, gives the expression for the saddle-node bifurcation boundary:\n$$\n\\varepsilon_c(a,b) = \\frac{b(1-a)^2}{4}\n$$\nThis expression defines the surface in the parameter space $(a,b,\\varepsilon)$ that separates the region with one equilibrium (monostable/excitable) from the region with three equilibria (bistable).",

We use the boundary conditions for the profile $U(z)$: $U(-\\infty) = 1$ and $U(\\infty) = 0$. Since the profile approaches constant values at infinity, its derivative must approach zero: $U'(-\\infty) = 0$ and $U'(\\infty) = 0$.\nThe first term is:\n$$\\frac{D}{2}\\left[(U'(z))^2\\right]_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} = \\frac{D}{2}\\left((U'(\\infty))^2 - (U'(-\\infty))^2\\right) = \\frac{D}{2}(0 - 0) = 0$$\nThe third term is:\n$$\\left[F(U(z))\\right]_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} = F(U(\\infty)) - F(U(-\\infty)) = F(0) - F(1)$$\nFrom the definition of $F(u)$, we have $F(0) = \\int_{0}^{0}f(s)ds = 0$.

Since $D > 0$ and the front is non-trivial (monotone decreasing), $U'(z)$ is not identically zero, meaning $\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty}(U'(z))^2 dz > 0$. Therefore, the sign of $c$ is determined entirely by the sign of the numerator:\n$$\\text{sign}(c) = \\text{sign}\\left(\\int_{0}^{1}f(u)du\\right)$$\nRecalling that $\\int_{0}^{1}f(u)du = F(1) - F(0) = F(1)$, the sign of $c$ is determined by the sign of $F(1)$. This term represents the difference in the potential $F(u)$ between the two stable equilibrium states $u=1$ and $u=0$.\n-   If $F(1) > F(0) = 0$, the state $u=1$ is more stable. The region where $u=1$ expands, invading the region where $u=0$. For the given front with $U(-\\infty)=1$ and $U(\\infty)=0$, this corresponds to propagation in the positive $x$ direction, so the wave speed $v=c/D$ is positive, implying $c>0$.\n-   If $F(1) < F(0) = 0$, the state $u=0$ is more stable. The region where $u=0$ expands. This corresponds to propagation in the negative $x$ direction, so $v < 0$ and $c < 0$.\n-   If $F(1) = 0$, the two states are equally stable, and the front is stationary ($c=0$).\n\nNow, we apply this to the specific cubic kinetics $f(u) = k\\,u\\,(u - a)\\,(1 - u)$, with $k>0$ and $0 < a < 1$. First, we compute the integral in the numerator:\n$$\\int_{0}^{1} f(u) du = \\int_{0}^{1} k\\,u\\,(u - a)\\,(1 - u) du$$\nExpanding the polynomial:\n$$f(u) = k(u^2 - au)(1 - u) = k(u^2 - u^3 - au + au^2) = k(-u^3 + (1+a)u^2 - au)$$\nNow we integrate:\n$$\\int_{0}^{1} k(-u^3 + (1+a)u^2 - au) du = k \\left[ -\\frac{u^4}{4} + (1+a)\\frac{u^3}{3} - a\\frac{u^2}{2} \\right]_{0}^{1}$$\n$$= k \\left( -\\frac{1}{4} + \\frac{1+a}{3} - \\frac{a}{2} - 0 \\right)$$\n$$= k \\left( \\frac{-3 + 4(1+a) - 6a}{12} \\right) = k \\left( \\frac{-3 + 4 + 4a - 6a}{12} \\right) = k \\left( \\frac{1 - 2a}{12} \\right)$$\nSo, $\\int_{0}^{1}f(u)du = \\frac{k(1-2a)}{12}$.\nFinally, we substitute this result into our expression for $c$:\n$$c = D \\frac{\\frac{k(1-2a)}{12}}{\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty}(U'(z))^2 dz} = \\frac{Dk(1-2a)}{12\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty}(U'(z))^2 dz}$$\nThe sign of $c$ is determined by the sign of the term $(1 - 2a)$, since all other factors ($D$, $k$, $12$, and the integral) are positive.\n-   If $a < 1/2$, then $1 - 2a > 0$, so $c > 0$.\n-   If $a > 1/2$, then $1 - 2a < 0$, so $c < 0$.\n-   If $a = 1/2$, then $1 - 2a = 0$, so $c = 0$.
