This exercise models drug transport through tissue with oriented fibers, a common biomedical scenario where microscopic architecture dictates macroscopic behavior . By solving the formal 'cell problem' for a simplified layered microstructure, you will derive the full homogenized diffusion tensor and see firsthand how it becomes anisotropic, capturing different effective transport rates parallel and perpendicular to the microscopic layers.",

Let the microscopic diffusivity be $d(\\mathbf{y})$, which is piecewise-constant and depends only on $y_{2}$: a fiber stripe occupies the region $0 \\le y_{2}  \\phi$ with $d = d_{f}$, and the surrounding matrix occupies $\\phi  y_{2} \\le 1$ with $d = d_{m}$.

This assumption implies that statistical properties like mean porosity and correlation structure are constant in space, which is only valid in the bulk of the material, far from any boundaries. Near a scaffold face, the correlation neighborhood of a point is truncated, invalidating the simple formula for $N_{corr}$. This \"boundary effect\" means that the variance of the averaged property decays more slowly with REV size. Consequently, a larger REV would be required near a boundary to achieve the same level of statistical representativeness as in the interior.",
