            "solution": "The problem statement is scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and contains all necessary information for a unique and meaningful solution. The parameters provided are physically plausible for transport in biological tissues. The problem is a standard application of dimensional analysis in the context of multiscale transport phenomena and homogenization theory, a relevant topic in biomedical systems modeling. Therefore, the problem is valid.\n\nThe solution proceeds in three stages: first, the derivation of the dimensionless Péclet ($\\mathrm{Pe}$) and Damköhler ($\\mathrm{Da}$) numbers from fundamental timescale definitions; second, the computation of their numerical values using the given parameters; and third, the evaluation of the homogenization indicator function $H$.\n\nFirst, we convert all given parameters to a consistent system of units, the International System of Units (SI).\n- Microstructural period length: $\\ell = 50 \\,\\mu\\text{m} = 5.0 \\times 10^{-5} \\,\\text{m}$.\n- Interstitial velocity magnitude: $u = 5 \\,\\mu\\text{m}\\,\\text{s}^{-1} = 5.0 \\times 10^{-6} \\,\\text{m}\\,\\text{s}^{-1}$.\n- Molecular diffusion coefficient: $D = 2.5 \\times 10^{-10} \\,\\text{m}^{2}\\,\\text{s}^{-1}$.\n- First-order reaction rate constant: $k = 1.0 \\times 10^{-2} \\,\\text{s}^{-1}$.\n\nNext, we define the characteristic timescales for the three transport processes occurring at the pore-scale, characterized by the length scale $\\ell$.\n\nThe characteristic time for advection, $\\tau_{\\text{adv}}$, is the time required for a solute particle to travel a distance $\\ell$ at speed $u$.\n$$\n\\tau_{\\text{adv}} = \\frac{\\ell}{u}\n$$\n\nThe characteristic time for diffusion, $\\tau_{\\text{diff}}$, is the time required for the solute to diffuse across the distance $\\ell$. This scales with the square of the length divided by the diffusion coefficient.\n$$\n\\tau_{\\text{diff}} = \\frac{\\ell^2}{D}\n$$\n\nThe characteristic time for the reaction, $\\tau_{\\text{rxn}}$, for a first-order process is the inverse of the rate constant $k$.\n$$\n\\tau_{\\text{rxn}} = \\frac{1}{k}\n$$\n\nThe Péclet number, $\\mathrm{Pe}$, is defined as the ratio of the rate of advection to the rate of diffusion. This is equivalent to the ratio of the diffusion timescale to the advection timescale. A high $\\mathrm{Pe}$ indicates that advection dominates diffusion.\n$$\n\\mathrm{Pe} = \\frac{\\tau_{\\text{diff}}}{\\tau_{\\text{adv}}} = \\frac{\\ell^2 / D}{\\ell / u} = \\frac{u\\ell}{D}\n$$\n\nThe Damköhler number, $\\mathrm{Da}$, is defined as the ratio of the reaction rate to the diffusion rate. This is equivalent to the ratio of the diffusion timescale to the reaction timescale.

The problem defines the criterion as:\n$$\nH(\\mathrm{Pe}, \\mathrm{Da}) = 1 \\quad \\text{if} \\quad \\mathrm{Pe} \\leq 1 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\mathrm{Da} \\leq 1\n$$\n$$\nH(\\mathrm{Pe}, \\mathrm{Da}) = 0 \\quad \\text{otherwise}\n$$\nWe have computed $\\mathrm{Pe} = 0.1000$ and $\\mathrm{Da} = 0.1000$. We check the conditions:\n1. Is $\\mathrm{Pe} \\leq 1$? Yes, $0.1000 \\leq 1$.\n2. Is $\\mathrm{Da} \\leq 1$? Yes, $0.1000 \\leq 1$.\nSince both conditions are met, the value of the indicator function is $H = 1$.\n\nThe condition $\\mathrm{Pe} \\leq 1$ signifies that at the microscale, solute diffusion is at least as fast as advective transport. The condition $\\mathrm{Da} \\leq 1$ signifies that diffusion is also at least as fast as the reaction rate. When diffusion is the dominant or co-dominant transport mechanism at the microscale, the solute concentration field can locally equilibrate within each periodic unit cell of the microstructure. This local equilibration is a fundamental prerequisite for the validity of periodic homogenization techniques, which separate the problem into a macroscopic effective medium problem and a local cell problem. If either $\\mathrm{Pe}$ or $\\mathrm{Da}$ were much greater than $1$, sharp concentration gradients (boundary layers) would form within the unit cell, violating the periodicity assumption required for standard homogenization approaches. Thus, $H=1$ indicates that the system is in a regime that favors the application of periodic homogenization.\n\nThe final answer is composed of the Péclet number, the Damköhler number, and the homogenization indicator.",

The components of the homogenized tensor are given by the formula:\n$$D^{\\mathrm{hom}}_{ij} = \\int_{Y} d(\\mathbf{y}) \\left(\\delta_{ij} + \\frac{\\partial \\chi^i}{\\partial y_j}(\\mathbf{y})\\right) d\\mathbf{y}$$\nwhere $\\chi^i(\\mathbf{y})$ for $i \\in \\{1,2\\}$ are the solutions to the cell problem:\n$$-\\nabla_{\\mathbf{y}} \\cdot \\left(d(\\mathbf{y})\\left(\\mathbf{e}_{i} + \\nabla_{\\mathbf{y}}\\chi^{i}(\\mathbf{y})\\right)\\right) = 0 \\quad \\text{in } Y$$\nwith $Y$-periodic boundary conditions and zero mean.\n\nThe given microscopic diffusivity $d(\\mathbf{y})$ depends only on the coordinate $y_2$, i.e., $d(\\mathbf{y}) = d(y_2)$. This layered structure suggests seeking solutions of the form $\\chi^i(\\mathbf{y}) = \\chi^i(y_2)$.\n\n**Case 1: Corrector $\\chi^1(\\mathbf{y})$ (for transport along $y_1$)**\n\nThe cell problem for $i=1$ is:\n$$-\\nabla_{\\mathbf{y}} \\cdot \\left(d(y_2)\\left(\\mathbf{e}_{1} + \\nabla_{\\mathbf{y}}\\chi^{1}\\right)\\right) = 0$$\nExpanding this gives:\n$$-\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y_1}\\left(d(y_2)\\left(1 + \\frac{\\partial \\chi^1}{\\partial y_1}\\right)\\right) - \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y_2}\\left(d(y_2)\\frac{\\partial \\chi^1}{\\partial y_2}\\right) = 0$$\nWith the ansatz $\\chi^1(\\mathbf{y}) = \\chi^1(y_2)$, we have $\\frac{\\partial \\chi^1}{\\partial y_1} = 0$. The equation simplifies to:\n$$-\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y_1}\\left(d(y_2)\\right) - \\frac{d}{d y_2}\\left(d(y_2)\\frac{d \\chi^1}{d y_2}\\right) = 0$$\nSince $d(y_2)$ does not depend on $y_1$, the first term is zero. We are left with:\n$$\\frac{d}{d y_2}\\left(d(y_2)\\frac{d \\chi^1}{d y_2}\\right) = 0$$\nIntegrating with respect to $y_2$ yields $d(y_2)\\frac{d \\chi^1}{d y_2} = C_1$, where $C_1$ is a constant. For $\\chi^1(y_2)$ to be periodic, we require $\\chi^1(1) = \\chi^1(0)$. Integrating $\\frac{d \\chi^1}{d y_2} = \\frac{C_1}{d(y_2)}$ from $0$ to $1$:\n$$\\chi^1(1) - \\chi^1(0) = \\int_0^1 \\frac{C_1}{d(y_2)} dy_2 = C_1 \\left( \\int_0^\\phi \\frac{1}{d_f} dy_2 + \\int_\\phi^1 \\frac{1}{d_m} dy_2 \\right) = C_1 \\left( \\frac{\\phi}{d_f} + \\frac{1-\\phi}{d_m} \\right)$$\nSince $d_f, d_m > 0$ and $\\phi \\in (0,1)$, the term in the parenthesis is strictly positive. For the periodicity condition $\\chi^1(1) - \\chi^1(0) = 0$ to hold, we must have $C_1 = 0$. This implies $\\frac{d\\chi^1}{dy_2}=0$, so $\\chi^1$ is a constant. The zero-mean condition $\\int_Y \\chi^1 \\,d\\mathbf{y} = 0$ then forces this constant to be zero. Thus, $\\chi^1(\\mathbf{y}) = 0$.\n\nNow we compute the components $D^{\\mathrm{hom}}_{1j}$:\n$$D^{\\mathrm{hom}}_{11} = \\int_Y d(y_2)\\left(1 + \\frac{\\partial \\chi^1}{\\partial y_1}\\right)d\\mathbf{y} = \\int_0^1\\int_0^1 d(y_2)(1+0) dy_1 dy_2 = \\int_0^1 d(y_2) dy_2$$\n$$D^{\\mathrm{hom}}_{11} = \\int_0^\\phi d_f dy_2 + \\int_\\phi^1 d_m dy_2 = \\phi d_f + (1-\\phi) d_m$$\nThis is the arithmetic mean of the diffusivities.\n$$D^{\\mathrm{hom}}_{12} = \\int_Y d(y_2)\\left(0 + \\frac{\\partial \\chi^1}{\\partial y_2}\\right)d\\mathbf{y} = \\int_Y d(y_2)(0) d\\mathbf{y} = 0$$\n\n**Case 2: Corrector $\\chi^2(\\mathbf{y})$ (for transport along $y_2$)**\n\nThe cell problem for $i=2$ is:\n$$-\\nabla_{\\mathbf{y}} \\cdot \\left(d(y_2)\\left(\\mathbf{e}_{2} + \\nabla_{\\mathbf{y}}\\chi^{2}\\right)\\right) = 0$$\nUsing the ansatz $\\chi^2(\\mathbf{y}) = \\chi^2(y_2)$, the PDE becomes an ODE:\n$$-\\frac{d}{d y_2}\\left(d(y_2)\\left(1 + \\frac{d \\chi^2}{d y_2}\\right)\\right) = 0$$\nIntegrating with respect to $y_2$:\n$$d(y_2)\\left(1 + \\frac{d \\chi^2}{d y_2}\\right) = C_2$$\nwhere $C_2$ is a constant. To find $C_2$, we enforce the periodicity of $\\chi^2$. Rearranging the equation gives $\\frac{d \\chi^2}{d y_2} = \\frac{C_2}{d(y_2)} - 1$. Integrating from $0$ to $1$:\n$$\\chi^2(1) - \\chi^2(0) = \\int_0^1 \\left(\\frac{C_2}{d(y_2)} - 1\\right) dy_2 = 0$$\n$$C_2 \\int_0^1 \\frac{1}{d(y_2)} dy_2 - \\int_0^1 1 dy_2 = 0$$\n$$C_2 \\left(\\frac{\\phi}{d_f} + \\frac{1-\\phi}{d_m}\\right) = 1 \\implies C_2 = \\left(\\frac{\\phi}{d_f} + \\frac{1-\\phi}{d_m}\\right)^{-1}$$\nNow we compute the components $D^{\\mathrm{hom}}_{2j}$:\n$$D^{\\mathrm{hom}}_{22} = \\int_Y d(y_2)\\left(1 + \\frac{\\partial \\chi^2}{\\partial y_2}\\right)d\\mathbf{y} = \\int_0^1\\int_0^1 d(y_2)\\left(1 + \\frac{d \\chi^2}{d y_2}\\right) dy_1 dy_2$$\nThe integrand $d(y_2)(1 + \\frac{d \\chi^2}{d y_2})$ is equal to the constant $C_2$.\n$$D^{\\mathrm{hom}}_{22} = \\int_0^1\\int_0^1 C_2 dy_1 dy_2 = C_2 = \\left(\\frac{\\phi}{d_f} + \\frac{1-\\phi}{d_m}\\right)^{-1}$$\nThis is the harmonic mean of the diffusivities.\n$$D^{\\mathrm{hom}}_{21} = \\int_Y d(y_2)\\left(0 + \\frac{\\partial \\chi^2}{\\partial y_1}\\right)d\\mathbf{y} = \\int_Y d(y_2)(0) d\\mathbf{y} = 0$$\n\n**Anisotropy Ratio Calculation**\n\nThe homogenized tensor is diagonal:\n$$ D^{\\mathrm{hom}} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\phi d_f + (1-\\phi) d_m & 0 \\\\ 0 & \\left(\\frac{\\phi}{d_f} + \\frac{1-\\phi}{d_m}\\right)^{-1} \\end{pmatrix} $$\nThe anisotropy ratio $A$ is:\n$$ A = \\frac{D^{\\mathrm{hom}}_{11}}{D^{\\mathrm{hom}}_{22}} = \\frac{\\phi d_f + (1-\\phi) d_m}{\\left(\\frac{\\phi}{d_f} + \\frac{1-\\phi}{d_m}\\right)^{-1}} = \\left(\\phi d_f + (1-\\phi) d_m\\right) \\left(\\frac{\\phi}{d_f} + \\frac{1-\\phi}{d_m}\\right) $$\nNow, we substitute the numerical values: $d_m = 1.6 \\times 10^{-9}\\,\\mathrm{m^{2}/s}$, $d_f = 0.2 \\times 10^{-9}\\,\\mathrm{m^{2}/s}$, and $\\phi = 0.35$.

            "solution": "The problem is assessed to be valid. It is scientifically grounded in the principles of fluid mechanics and porous media theory, specifically Stokes flow, the Hagen-Poiseuille law, and Darcy's law. The problem is well-posed, with all necessary parameters and definitions provided for a unique and meaningful solution. The language is objective and the tasks are formalizable mathematical derivations and computations. The provided parameters are physically realistic and do not lead to contradictions. Therefore, a reasoned solution is presented below.\n\nThe solution is organized into three tasks as specified in the problem statement.\n\nTask $1$: Homogenized intrinsic permeability tensor\n\nThe goal is to derive the homogenized permeability tensor, $\\mathbf{K}_{\\mathrm{hom}}$, by considering an infinitely periodic medium. This is achieved by analyzing a representative elementary volume (REV), which for a periodic medium is the unit cell. The unit cell is a square prism with cross-sectional area $A_{\\text{cell}} = L^2$ and length $l$, containing a single cylindrical pore of radius $a$ at its center. The flow is driven by a macroscopic pressure gradient $\\nabla p$. Since the pressure drop $\\Delta p$ is applied uniformly along the $z$-axis over a length $l$, the pressure gradient vector is $\\nabla p = (0, 0, -\\Delta p / l)$.\n\nThe flow within a single pore is governed by the Hagen-Poiseuille law for laminar Stokes flow in a circular tube. The volumetric flow rate, $Q_{\\text{pore}}$, is given by:\n$$Q_{\\text{pore}} = \\frac{\\pi a^4}{8\\mu} \\frac{\\Delta p}{l}$$\nwhere $\\mu$ is the dynamic viscosity. We can express this in terms of the $z$-component of the pressure gradient, $(\\nabla p)_z = -\\Delta p / l$:\n$$Q_{\\text{pore}} = -\\frac{\\pi a^4}{8\\mu} (\\nabla p)_z$$\nTo homogenize, we compute the average flux, $q_{\\mathrm{hom},z}$, by distributing this flow over the entire cross-sectional area of the unit cell, $A_{\\text{cell}} = L^2$:\n$$q_{\\mathrm{hom},z} = \\frac{Q_{\\text{pore}}}{A_{\\text{cell}}} = \\frac{1}{L^2} \\left( -\\frac{\\pi a^4}{8\\mu} (\\nabla p)_z \\right) = -\\frac{\\pi a^4}{8L^2\\mu} (\\nabla p)_z$$\nThis equation relates the average flux to the pressure gradient at the microscale. We now compare this to the macroscopic Darcy's law:\n$$\\mathbf{q} = -\\frac{\\mathbf{K}_{\\mathrm{hom}}}{\\mu} \\nabla p$$\nThe $z$-component of this vector equation is:\n$$q_{\\mathrm{hom},z} = -\\frac{1}{\\mu} \\left( K_{\\mathrm{hom},zx} (\\nabla p)_x + K_{\\mathrm{hom},zy} (\\nabla p)_y + K_{\\mathrm{hom},zz} (\\nabla p)_z \\right)$$\nIn our problem, the applied pressure gradient has components $(\\nabla p)_x = 0$ and $(\\nabla p)_y = 0$, so the expression simplifies to:\n$$q_{\\mathrm{hom},z} = -\\frac{K_{\\mathrm{hom},zz}}{\\mu} (\\nabla p)_z$$\nBy equating the two expressions for $q_{\\mathrm{hom},z}$, we find:\n$$-\\frac{K_{\\mathrm{hom},zz}}{\\mu} (\\nabla p)_z = -\\frac{\\pi a^4}{8L^2\\mu} (\\nabla p)_z$$\n$$\\implies K_{\\mathrm{hom},zz} = \\frac{\\pi a^4}{8L^2}$$\nThis expression for $K_{\\mathrm{hom},zz}$ depends only on the geometric parameters $a$ and $L$, as required. Its units are $[L]^4/[L]^2 = [L]^2$, which in SI units is $\\mathrm{m}^2$, the correct unit for intrinsic permeability.\n\nRegarding the tensor's properties: The medium consists of straight, parallel pores aligned with the $z$-axis, embedded in an impermeable matrix. Therefore, a pressure gradient in the $x$ or $y$ directions cannot produce a macroscopic flow, implying $K_{xx} = K_{yy} = 0$. Furthermore, the symmetry of the channels being parallel to the $z$-axis ensures that a pressure gradient along $z$ will only produce flow along $z$. Thus, there are no off-diagonal coupling terms like $K_{xz}$ or $K_{yz}$. The permeability tensor for Stokes flow is symmetric, so $K_{ij}=K_{ji}$. This means all off-diagonal components are zero. The permeability is highly anisotropic, being non-zero only for flow along the pore direction. The homogenized permeability tensor is diagonal:\n$$\\mathbf{K}_{\\mathrm{hom}} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & K_{\\mathrm{hom},zz} \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & \\frac{\\pi a^4}{8L^2} \\end{pmatrix}$$\n\nTask $2$: Direct permeability for finite scale separation\n\nFor a finite sample of cross-sectional width $W$, we use a simplified direct model that only considers pores fully contained within the $W \\times W$ area. The number of such pores, $N$, is given by the number of unit cells of side length $L$ that can be tiled into the sample's cross-section:\n$$N = \\left\\lfloor \\frac{W}{L} \\right\\rfloor^2$$\nThe total volumetric flow rate, $Q_{\\mathrm{tot}}$, is the sum of the flow rates through these $N$ identical pores. Since each pore is subject to the same pressure drop $\\Delta p$ over length $l$:\n$$Q_{\\mathrm{tot}} = N \\cdot Q_{\\text{pore}} = \\left\\lfloor \\frac{W}{L} \\right\\rfloor^2 \\left( \\frac{\\pi a^4}{8\\mu} \\frac{\\Delta p}{l} \\right)$$\nThe average flux, $q_{\\mathrm{dir}}$, is this total flow rate divided by the total cross-sectional area of the sample, $A = W^2$:\n$$q_{\\mathrm{dir}} = \\frac{Q_{\\mathrm{tot}}}{A} = \\frac{\\left\\lfloor W/L \\right\\rfloor^2}{W^2} \\left( \\frac{\\pi a^4}{8\\mu} \\frac{\\Delta p}{l} \\right)$$\nWe define the direct permeability, $K_{\\mathrm{dir},zz}$, by applying Darcy's law to the macroscopic sample:\n$$q_{\\mathrm{dir}} = \\frac{K_{\\mathrm{dir},zz}}{\\mu} \\frac{\\Delta p}{l}$$\nEquating the two expressions for $q_{\\mathrm{dir}}$:\n$$\\frac{K_{\\mathrm{dir},zz}}{\\mu} \\frac{\\Delta p}{l} = \\frac{\\left\\lfloor W/L \\right\\rfloor^2}{W^2} \\frac{\\pi a^4}{8\\mu} \\frac{\\Delta p}{l}$$\nThe terms $\\mu$, $\\Delta p$, and $l$ cancel from both sides, demonstrating that the calculated permeability is an intrinsic property of the geometry, independent of the fluid properties or applied pressure gradient, as long as the flow remains in the creeping regime. This leaves:\n$$K_{\\mathrm{dir},zz} = \\frac{\\pi a^4}{8} \\frac{\\left\\lfloor W/L \\right\\rfloor^2}{W^2}$$\n\nTask $3$: Comparison\n\nWe need to compute $K_{\\mathrm{hom},zz}$, $K_{\\mathrm{dir},zz}$, and their relative difference $\\delta$ for each test case.\n$$K_{\\mathrm{hom},zz} = \\frac{\\pi a^4}{8L^2}$$\n$$K_{\\mathrm{dir},zz} = \\frac{\\pi a^4}{8W^2} \\left\\lfloor \\frac{W}{L} \\right\\rfloor^2$$\nThe relative difference is defined as:\n$$\\delta = \\frac{K_{\\mathrm{dir},zz} - K_{\\mathrm{hom},zz}}{K_{\\mathrm{hom},zz}} = \\frac{K_{\\mathrm{dir},zz}}{K_{\\mathrm{hom},zz}} - 1$$\nSubstituting the expressions derived above:\n$$\\frac{K_{\\mathrm{dir},zz}}{K_{\\mathrm{hom},zz}} = \\frac{\\frac{\\pi a^4}{8W^2} \\left\\lfloor \\frac{W}{L} \\right\\rfloor^2}{\\frac{\\pi a^4}{8L^2}} = \\frac{L^2}{W^2} \\left\\lfloor \\frac{W}{L} \\right\\rfloor^2 = \\left( \\frac{L}{W} \\left\\lfloor \\frac{W}{L} \\right\\rfloor \\right)^2$$\nTherefore, the relative difference is:\n$$\\delta = \\left( \\frac{L}{W} \\left\\lfloor \\frac{W}{L} \\right\\rfloor \\right)^2 - 1$$\nThis formula depends only on the ratio $W/L$, highlighting that $\\delta$ represents a finite-size effect. Since $\\lfloor x \\rfloor \\le x$, the term $(\\frac{L}{W} \\lfloor \\frac{W}{L} \\rfloor)$ is always less than or equal to $1$, meaning $\\delta$ will be less than or equal to $0$. This reflects that the simplified direct model neglects pores near the boundary, effectively underestimating the permeability compared to the ideal homogenized limit.\n\nCalculations for the test suite:\n\nCase $1$: $L = 5.0 \\times 10^{-5}\\,\\mathrm{m}$, $a = 1.0 \\times 10^{-5}\\,\\mathrm{m}$, $W = 5.03 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{m}$\n$W/L = (5.03 \\times 10^{-3}) / (5.0 \\times 10^{-5}) = 100.6$\n$K_{\\mathrm{hom},zz} = \\frac{\\pi (1.0 \\times 10^{-5})^4}{8 (5.0 \\times 10^{-5})^2} = \\frac{\\pi \\times 10^{-20}}{8 \\times 25 \\times 10^{-10}} = \\frac{\\pi}{200} \\times 10^{-10} \\approx 1.5708 \\times 10^{-12}\\,\\mathrm{m}^2$\n$\\delta = (\\frac{1}{100.6} \\lfloor 100.6 \\rfloor)^2 - 1 = (\\frac{100}{100.6})^2 - 1 \\approx -0.011894$\n$K_{\\mathrm{dir},zz} = K_{\\mathrm{hom},zz} (1+\\delta) \\approx 1.5708 \\times 10^{-12} \\times (1 - 0.011894) \\approx 1.5521 \\times 10^{-12}\\,\\mathrm{m}^2$\n\nCase $2$: $L = 5.0 \\times 10^{-5}\\,\\mathrm{m}$, $a = 1.0 \\times 10^{-5}\\,\\mathrm{m}$, $W = 8.0 \\times 10^{-5}\\,\\mathrm{m}$\n$W/L = (8.0 \\times 10^{-5}) / (5.0 \\times 10^{-5}) = 1.6$\n$K_{\\mathrm{hom},zz}$ is the same as in Case 1: $\\approx 1.5708 \\times 10^{-12}\\,\\mathrm{m}^2$\n$\\delta = (\\frac{1}{1.6} \\lfloor 1.6 \\rfloor)^2 - 1 = (\\frac{1}{1.6})^2 - 1 = 0.625^2 - 1 = -0.609375$\n$K_{\\mathrm{dir},zz} = K_{\\mathrm{hom},zz} (1+\\delta) \\approx 1.5708 \\times 10^{-12} \\times (1 - 0.609375) \\approx 6.1359 \\times 10^{-13}\\,\\mathrm{m}^2$\n\nCase $3$: $L = 5.0 \\times 10^{-5}\\,\\mathrm{m}$, $a = 2.0 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{m}$, $W = 1.01 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{m}$\n$W/L = (1.01 \\times 10^{-3}) / (5.0 \\times 10^{-5}) = 20.2$\n$K_{\\mathrm{hom},zz} = \\frac{\\pi (2.0 \\times 10^{-6})^4}{8 (5.0 \\times 10^{-5})^2} = \\frac{\\pi \\times 16 \\times 10^{-24}}{200 \\times 10^{-10}} = \\frac{16\\pi}{200} \\times 10^{-14} \\approx 2.5133 \\times 10^{-16}\\,\\mathrm{m}^2$\n$\\delta = (\\frac{1}{20.2} \\lfloor 20.2 \\rfloor)^2 - 1 = (\\frac{20}{20.2})^2 - 1 \\approx -0.019704$\n$K_{\\mathrm{dir},zz} = K_{\\mathrm{hom},zz} (1+\\delta) \\approx 2.5133 \\times 10^{-16} \\times (1 - 0.019704) \\approx 2.4637 \\times 10^{-16}\\,\\mathrm{m}^2$\n\nCase $4$: $L = 5.0 \\times 10^{-5}\\,\\mathrm{m}$, $a = 1.0 \\times 10^{-5}\\,\\mathrm{m}$, $W = 3.0 \\times 10^{-5}\\,\\mathrm{m}$\n$W/L = (3.0 \\times 10^{-5}) / (5.0 \\times 10^{-5}) = 0.6$\n$K_{\\mathrm{hom},zz}$ is the same as in Case 1: $\\approx 1.5708 \\times 10^{-12}\\,\\mathrm{m}^2$\nSince $W < L$, $\\lfloor W/L \\rfloor = 0$.
