            "problem": "A planar subendothelial tissue layer adjacent to vascular smooth muscle is modeled as a one-dimensional slab of thickness $L$ in the coordinate $x \\in [0, L]$, where $x = 0$ denotes the endothelial interface and $x = L$ denotes the smooth muscle interface. Nitric oxide (NO) diffuses within this layer with a constant molecular diffusion coefficient $D$ and is consumed by first-order kinetics with rate constant $k$. The smooth muscle interface at $x = L$ acts as a perfect sink due to rapid scavenging, so the nitric oxide concentration satisfies $C(L) = 0$. At the endothelial interface $x = 0$, endothelial synthesis and transport control the transwall concentration gradient, which can be tuned.\n\nAssume steady state, no convection, no volumetric production within the layer, and isotropic diffusion. Starting from conservation of mass and Fick’s law, derive the steady-state concentration field $C(x)$ and use the requirement that the spatial average of $C(x)$ over the slab equals a prescribed target level $C^{\\star}$ to determine the transwall gradient at the endothelial interface.

Validation:**\nThe problem constitutes a standard, one-dimensional, steady-state diffusion-reaction problem, a canonical model in transport phenomena and biomedical engineering. The governing physics are based on conservation of mass and Fick's law, and the first-order reaction kinetics is a common and valid approximation for solute consumption in biological tissues. The boundary conditions consist of a prescribed concentration at one end and an integral constraint over the domain. For a second-order ordinary differential equation, these two conditions are sufficient to determine a unique solution. The problem is well-posed, scientifically sound, and free of ambiguity or contradiction.\n\n**3. Verdict:**\nThe problem is valid. A rigorous derivation of the solution follows.\n\n**Derivation of the Governing Equation**\nThe conservation of mass for a species with concentration $C$ in a one-dimensional system is given by:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial C}{\\partial t} = - \\frac{\\partial J}{\\partial x} + R $$\nwhere $J$ is the molar flux and $R$ is the net rate of volumetric production.\nThe problem states the system is at steady state, so $\\frac{\\partial C}{\\partial t} = 0$.\nTransport is by diffusion only (no convection), so the flux is given by Fick's first law. Since diffusion is isotropic, $D$ is a scalar constant:\n$$ J = -D \\frac{dC}{dx} $$\nThere is no volumetric production, and consumption follows first-order kinetics. Thus, the net production rate is $R = -kC$.\nSubstituting these into the conservation equation yields the steady-state diffusion-reaction equation:\n$$ 0 = - \\frac{d}{dx}\\left(-D \\frac{dC}{dx}\\right) - kC $$\nAs $D$ is constant, this simplifies to a second-order linear homogeneous ordinary differential equation (ODE):\n$$ D \\frac{d^2C}{dx^2} - kC = 0 $$\n$$ \\frac{d^2C}{dx^2} - \\frac{k}{D} C = 0 $$\n\n**Solution of the ODE**\nTo solve this ODE, we define a characteristic length scale, $\\lambda^{-1}$, where $\\lambda = \\sqrt{k/D}$. The ODE becomes:\n$$ \\frac{d^2C}{dx^2} - \\lambda^2 C = 0 $$\nThe general solution to this equation can be expressed using hyperbolic functions:\n$$ C(x) = A \\cosh(\\lambda x) + B \\sinh(\\lambda x) $$\nwhere $A$ and $B$ are constants to be determined from the boundary and integral conditions.\n\nAn equivalent and often more convenient form of the general solution, especially when a boundary condition is at a non-zero position, is:\n$$ C(x) = C_1 \\sinh(\\lambda(L-x)) + C_2 \\cosh(\\lambda(L-x)) $$\nWe apply the boundary condition at $x=L$, which is $C(L)=0$:\n$$ C(L) = C_1 \\sinh(\\lambda(L-L)) + C_2 \\cosh(\\lambda(L-L)) = C_1 \\sinh(0) + C_2 \\cosh(0) = C_1(0) + C_2(1) = C_2 $$\nSince $C(L)=0$, we must have $C_2=0$. The solution form thus simplifies to:\n$$ C(x) = C_1 \\sinh(\\lambda(L-x)) $$\nThis form elegantly incorporates the boundary condition at $x=L$. The remaining constant, $C_1$, must be determined using the integral constraint.\n\n**Application of the Integral Constraint**\nThe problem requires that the average concentration across the slab thickness $L$ equals a target concentration $C^{\\star}$:\n$$ \\frac{1}{L} \\int_{0}^{L} C(x) \\,dx = C^{\\star} $$\nSubstituting the solution for $C(x)$:\n$$ \\frac{1}{L} \\int_{0}^{L} C_1 \\sinh(\\lambda(L-x)) \\,dx = C^{\\star} $$\nWe evaluate the integral:\n$$ \\int_{0}^{L} \\sinh(\\lambda(L-x)) \\,dx = \\left[ -\\frac{1}{\\lambda} \\cosh(\\lambda(L-x)) \\right]_{0}^{L} $$\n$$ = -\\frac{1}{\\lambda} \\left( \\cosh(\\lambda(L-L)) - \\cosh(\\lambda(L-0)) \\right) = -\\frac{1}{\\lambda} \\left( \\cosh(0) - \\cosh(\\lambda L) \\right) $$\n$$ = -\\frac{1}{\\lambda} \\left( 1 - \\cosh(\\lambda L) \\right) = \\frac{1}{\\lambda} \\left( \\cosh(\\lambda L) - 1 \\right) $$\nNow, we substitute this result back into the constraint equation:\n$$ \\frac{C_1}{L} \\left( \\frac{\\cosh(\\lambda L) - 1}{\\lambda} \\right) = C^{\\star} $$\nSolving for the constant $C_1$:\n$$ C_1 = \\frac{L C^{\\star} \\lambda}{\\cosh(\\lambda L) - 1} $$\nWith $C_1$ determined, the steady-state concentration profile $C(x)$ is fully specified.\n\n**Calculation of the Transwall Gradient**\nThe final step is to compute the quantity $-\\frac{dC}{dx}\\big|_{x=0}$. First, we differentiate the concentration profile $C(x) = C_1 \\sinh(\\lambda(L-x))$ with respect to $x$:\n$$ \\frac{dC}{dx} = \\frac{d}{dx} \\left[ C_1 \\sinh(\\lambda(L-x)) \\right] = C_1 \\cosh(\\lambda(L-x)) \\cdot (-\\lambda) = -C_1 \\lambda \\cosh(\\lambda(L-x)) $$\nThe quantity of interest is the negative of this gradient:\n$$ -\\frac{dC}{dx} = C_1 \\lambda \\cosh(\\lambda(L-x)) $$\nWe evaluate this expression at the endothelial interface, $x=0$:\n$$ -\\frac{dC}{dx}\\bigg|_{x=0} = C_1 \\lambda \\cosh(\\lambda(L-0)) = C_1 \\lambda \\cosh(\\lambda L) $$\nNow, we substitute the previously found expression for $C_1$:\n$$ -\\frac{dC}{dx}\\bigg|_{x=0} = \\left( \\frac{L C^{\\star} \\lambda}{\\cosh(\\lambda L) - 1} \\right) \\lambda \\cosh(\\lambda L) = \\frac{L C^{\\star} \\lambda^2 \\cosh(\\lambda L)}{\\cosh(\\lambda L) - 1} $$\nFinally, we substitute back the definition $\\lambda^2 = k/D$ to express the result in terms of the original problem parameters:\n$$ -\\frac{dC}{dx}\\bigg|_{x=0} = \\frac{L C^{\\star} \\left(\\frac{k}{D}\\right) \\cosh\\left(L \\sqrt{\\frac{k}{D}}\\right)}{\\cosh\\left(L \\sqrt{\\frac{k}{D}}\\right) - 1} $$\nThis expression represents the required magnitude of the concentration gradient at the endothelial wall to maintain the desired average NO concentration $C^{\\star}$ within the tissue slab. The units of this quantity are concentration per length (e.g., $\\text{mol}\\,\\text{m}^{-4}$ if $C$ is in $\\text{mol}\\,\\text{m}^{-3}$ and $x$ is in $\\text{m}$), which is dimensionally consistent.",

We proceed to the solution.\n\n### Derivation of the Similarity Solution\n\nFirst, we non-dimensionalize the concentration to simplify the boundary conditions. Let\n$$ U(x,t) = \\frac{c(x,t) - c_i}{c_b - c_i} $$\nThe governing equation and boundary/initial conditions for $U$ become:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial U}{\\partial t} = D \\frac{\\partial^2 U}{\\partial x^2} $$\n$$ U(x,0) = 0 $$\n$$ U(0,t) = 1 $$\n$$ U(x,t) \\to 0 \\quad \\text{as} \\quad x \\to \\infty $$\nThis problem lacks a characteristic length or time scale, suggesting a similarity solution exists. The physical scaling for diffusion processes is $x^2 \\sim Dt$, which motivates a similarity variable $\\eta \\propto x/\\sqrt{Dt}$. We choose the standard form $\\eta = x / (2\\sqrt{Dt})$. We assume the solution $U(x,t)$ can be expressed as a function of $\\eta$ alone, $U(x,t) = f(\\eta)$.\n\nUsing the chain rule, we transform the PDE for $U(x,t)$ into an ordinary differential equation (ODE) for $f(\\eta)$:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial U}{\\partial t} = \\frac{df}{d\\eta} \\frac{\\partial \\eta}{\\partial t} = f'(\\eta) \\left( \\frac{x}{2\\sqrt{D}} \\right) \\left( -\\frac{1}{2}t^{-3/2} \\right) = -f'(\\eta) \\frac{x}{4\\sqrt{D}t^{3/2}} = -f'(\\eta) \\frac{\\eta}{2t} $$\n$$ \\frac{\\partial U}{\\partial x} = \\frac{df}{d\\eta} \\frac{\\partial \\eta}{\\partial x} = f'(\\eta) \\frac{1}{2\\sqrt{Dt}} $$\n$$ \\frac{\\partial^2 U}{\\partial x^2} = \\frac{d}{d\\eta}\\left(f'(\\eta) \\frac{1}{2\\sqrt{Dt}}\\right) \\frac{\\partial \\eta}{\\partial x} = f''(\\eta) \\left(\\frac{1}{2\\sqrt{Dt}}\\right)^2 = \\frac{f''(\\eta)}{4Dt} $$\nSubstituting these into the PDE $\\partial U/\\partial t = D\\,\\partial^2 U/\\partial x^2$:\n$$ -f'(\\eta) \\frac{\\eta}{2t} = D \\left( \\frac{f''(\\eta)}{4Dt} \\right) \\implies f''(\\eta) + 2\\eta f'(\\eta) = 0 $$\nThe boundary conditions for $f(\\eta)$ are:\n$$ f(\\eta=0) = U(0,t) = 1 $$\n$$ f(\\eta \\to \\infty) = U(x\\to\\infty, t) = 0 $$\nTo solve the ODE, let $g(\\eta) = f'(\\eta)$. The equation becomes $g' + 2\\eta g = 0$, a first-order separable ODE.\n$$ \\frac{dg}{g} = -2\\eta \\, d\\eta \\implies \\ln(g) = -\\eta^2 + K_1 \\implies g(\\eta) = K_2 e^{-\\eta^2} $$\nSo, $f'(\\eta) = K_2 e^{-\\eta^2}$. Integrating this gives:\n$$ f(\\eta) = K_2 \\int_0^\\eta e^{-s^2} ds + K_3 $$\nApplying the boundary conditions:\n$$ f(0) = 1 \\implies 1 = K_2 \\int_0^0 e^{-s^2} ds + K_3 \\implies K_3 = 1 $$\n$$ f(\\eta \\to \\infty) = 0 \\implies 0 = K_2 \\int_0^\\infty e^{-s^2} ds + 1 $$\nThe definite integral $\\int_0^\\infty e^{-s^2} ds = \\sqrt{\\pi}/2$.\n$$ 0 = K_2 \\frac{\\sqrt{\\pi}}{2} + 1 \\implies K_2 = -\\frac{2}{\\sqrt{\\pi}} $$\nThe solution for $f(\\eta)$ is:\n$$ f(\\eta) = 1 - \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{\\pi}} \\int_0^\\eta e^{-s^2} ds $$\nRecognizing the definition of the error function, $\\operatorname{erf}(\\eta) = \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{\\pi}}\\int_0^\\eta e^{-s^2} ds$, and the complementary error function, $\\operatorname{erfc}(\\eta) = 1 - \\operatorname{erf}(\\eta)$, we have:\n$$ f(\\eta) = 1 - \\operatorname{erf}(\\eta) = \\operatorname{erfc}(\\eta) $$\nTherefore, $U(x,t) = \\operatorname{erfc}\\left(\\frac{x}{2\\sqrt{Dt}}\\right)$. The full solution for $c(x,t)$ is:\n$$ c(x,t) = c_i + (c_b - c_i) \\operatorname{erfc}\\left(\\frac{x}{2\\sqrt{Dt}}\\right) $$\n\n### Evaluation of Options\n\n**A. With the similarity variable $\\eta = x/\\!\\left(2\\sqrt{D t}\\right)$, the dimensionless concentration $U(\\eta) = \\left(c(x,t)-c_i\\right)/\\left(c_b-c_i\\right)$ equals the complementary error function $\\operatorname{erfc}(\\eta)$, which is equivalently written as $c(x,t)=c_b+\\left(c_i-c_b\\right)\\operatorname{erf}(\\eta)$ for $x\\ge 0$, $t>0$, satisfying $c(0,t)=c_b$ and $c(x,t)\\to c_i$ as $x\\to\\infty$.**\nOur derivation shows that with $\\eta = x/(2\\sqrt{Dt})$, we get $U(\\eta) = \\operatorname{erfc}(\\eta)$. This is the first part of the statement.\nTo check the equivalent form for $c(x,t)$:\n$c(x,t) = c_i + (c_b - c_i)\\operatorname{erfc}(\\eta) = c_i + (c_b-c_i)(1-\\operatorname{erf}(\\eta)) = c_i + c_b - c_i - (c_b-c_i)\\operatorname{erf}(\\eta) = c_b - (c_b - c_i)\\operatorname{erf}(\\eta) = c_b + (c_i - c_b)\\operatorname{erf}(\\eta)$. This is also correct.\nLet's check the boundary conditions with this form.\nAt $x=0$, $\\eta=0$, $\\operatorname{erf}(0)=0$. So $c(0,t) = c_b + (c_i - c_b)(0) = c_b$. Correct.\nAs $x \\to \\infty$, $\\eta \\to \\infty$, $\\operatorname{erf}(\\infty)=1$. So $c(x,t) \\to c_b + (c_i - c_b)(1) = c_i$. Correct.\nThe statement is entirely accurate.\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\n**B. A valid similarity variable is $\\eta = x/\\!\\left(\\sqrt{D}\\,t\\right)$, which yields $U(\\eta)=\\operatorname{erf}(\\eta)$; hence the characteristic penetration depth grows linearly with time as $\\delta(t)\\sim D\\,t$.**\nLet's test the similarity variable $\\eta = x/(\\sqrt{D}t)$. The partial derivatives become:\n$\\partial U/\\partial t = -f'(\\eta) \\eta/t$\n$\\partial^2 U/\\partial x^2 = f''(\\eta) / (Dt^2)$\nSubstituting into the PDE gives $-f'(\\eta)\\eta/t = D(f''(\\eta)/(Dt^2))$, which simplifies to $f''(\\eta) + \\eta t f'(\\eta) = 0$. The explicit dependence on $t$ remains, so the PDE is not reduced to an ODE. This similarity variable is not valid.\nFurthermore, the correct similarity variable $\\eta \\propto x/\\sqrt{Dt}$ implies that for any fixed feature of the profile (e.g., where concentration reaches a certain value, corresponding to $\\eta = \\text{constant}$), we have $x \\propto \\sqrt{Dt}$. The characteristic penetration depth $\\delta(t)$ scales as $\\sqrt{t}$, not linearly with $t$.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**C. The boundary flux $J(0,t)=-D\\,\\partial c/\\partial x\\,\\big|_{x=0}$ predicted by the similarity solution decays as $t^{-1/2}$, with magnitude $J(0,t) = \\left(c_b-c_i\\right)\\sqrt{D}/\\sqrt{\\pi t}$ for $c_b>c_i$.**\nThe flux is given by Fick's first law: $J(x,t) = -D\\,\\partial c/\\partial x$. We first compute the spatial gradient of the concentration profile $c(x,t) = c_i + (c_b-c_i)\\operatorname{erfc}(\\eta)$.\n$$ \\frac{\\partial c}{\\partial x} = (c_b - c_i) \\frac{d}{d\\eta}\\left(\\operatorname{erfc}(\\eta)\\right) \\frac{\\partial \\eta}{\\partial x} $$\nUsing $\\frac{d}{d\\eta}\\operatorname{erfc}(\\eta) = - \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{\\pi}}e^{-\\eta^2}$ and $\\frac{\\partial \\eta}{\\partial x} = \\frac{1}{2\\sqrt{Dt}}$, we get:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial c}{\\partial x} = (c_b - c_i) \\left( - \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{\\pi}}e^{-\\eta^2} \\right) \\left( \\frac{1}{2\\sqrt{Dt}} \\right) = - \\frac{(c_b-c_i)}{\\sqrt{\\pi D t}}e^{-x^2/(4Dt)} $$\nThe flux at the boundary $x=0$ (where $\\eta=0$) is:\n$$ J(0,t) = -D \\left.\\frac{\\partial c}{\\partial x}\\right|_{x=0} = -D \\left( - \\frac{(c_b-c_i)}{\\sqrt{\\pi D t}}e^{0} \\right) = \\frac{D(c_b-c_i)}{\\sqrt{\\pi D t}} = (c_b - c_i)\\sqrt{\\frac{D}{\\pi t}} $$\nThis expression shows that the flux $J(0,t)$ is proportional to $1/\\sqrt{t}$ or $t^{-1/2}$, so it decays with time. If $c_b > c_i$, the flux is positive (into the tissue), and its magnitude is indeed $(c_b - c_i)\\sqrt{D/(\\pi t)}$, which is identical to the expression given.\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\n**D. The cumulative solute uptake per unit area $Q(t)=\\int_0^\\infty \\big(c(x,t)-c_i\\big)\\,dx$ grows linearly in time, $Q(t)\\propto t$, reflecting a constant boundary flux.**\nThe cumulative uptake $Q(t)$ can be found by integrating the net influx over time. The only flux into the domain is at $x=0$, as the flux at $x \\to \\infty$ is zero.\n$$ Q(t) = \\int_0^t J(0, \\tau) \\, d\\tau $$\nUsing the result from option C, $J(0,t) = (c_b-c_i)\\sqrt{D/\\pi} \\cdot \\tau^{-1/2}$:\n$$ Q(t) = \\int_0^t (c_b-c_i)\\sqrt{\\frac{D}{\\pi}} \\tau^{-1/2} \\, d\\tau = (c_b-c_i)\\sqrt{\\frac{D}{\\pi}} \\left[ 2\\tau^{1/2} \\right]_0^t = 2(c_b - c_i)\\sqrt{\\frac{Dt}{\\pi}} $$\nThis result shows that the cumulative uptake $Q(t)$ grows proportionally to $\\sqrt{t}$ or $t^{1/2}$, not linearly with $t$. The statement that this reflects a constant boundary flux is also incorrect; as shown in C, the flux decays as $t^{-1/2}$.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**E. Because $\\operatorname{erf}(\\eta)$ increases monotonically from $0$ to $1$ as $\\eta$ increases, the profile $c(x,t)=c_b+\\left(c_i-c_b\\right)\\operatorname{erf}(\\eta)$ is monotone in $x$ from $c_b$ to $c_i$; plotting $c(x,t)$ versus $\\eta$ collapses profiles at different times onto a single curve, and the transition thickness scales as $\\mathcal{O}\\!\\left(\\sqrt{D t}\\right)$.**\nLet's examine each part of the statement.\n1.  **Monotonicity**: At a fixed time $t$, $\\eta = x/(2\\sqrt{Dt})$ is a monotonically increasing function of $x$. The function $\\operatorname{erf}(\\eta)$ is also monotonically increasing. If $c_i > c_b$, the prefactor $(c_i-c_b)$ is positive, so $c(x,t)$ increases monotonically with $x$ from $c(0,t)=c_b$ to $c(\\infty,t)=c_i$. If $c_i < c_b$, the prefactor is negative, so $c(x,t)$ decreases monotonically from $c_b$ to $c_i$. In both cases, the profile is monotone as stated. This is correct.\n2.  **Data Collapse**: The solution form $c = c_b + (c_i - c_b)\\operatorname{erf}(\\eta)$ shows that the concentration $c$ is a function of the similarity variable $\\eta$ alone. Thus, if one plots experimental or numerical data for $c(x,t)$ against the corresponding value of $\\eta(x,t) = x/(2\\sqrt{Dt})$, all data points from different times will collapse onto this single universal curve. This is the defining characteristic of a similarity solution. This is correct.\n3.  **Scaling of Thickness**: A characteristic \"transition thickness\" or \"penetration depth\" $\\delta$ corresponds to the region where $c(x,t)$ significantly differs from $c_i$. This corresponds to a range of $\\eta$, say from $0$ to some value $\\eta_0$ (e.g., $\\eta_0=2$, where $\\operatorname{erfc}(2) \\approx 0.0047$). The physical location of this point is $x_0 = 2\\eta_0\\sqrt{Dt}$. Thus, any such thickness must scale with $\\sqrt{Dt}$. The scaling is correctly stated as $\\mathcal{O}(\\sqrt{Dt})$. This is correct.\nAll parts of the statement are accurate.\n**Verdict: Correct**",

            "introduction": "Our final practice problem elevates the analysis from solving forward problems to tackling a more realistic challenge: inverse modeling. Here, you will learn how to estimate the underlying physical parameters of a system—diffusivity $D$ and reaction rate constant $k$—from simulated experimental data . By relating the analytical solution of the reaction-diffusion equation to observable modal decay rates, this exercise demonstrates a powerful method for parameter identification and highlights the crucial link between theoretical models and measurable data.",

            "solution": "The problem requires the formulation of an inverse problem for parameter estimation and the subsequent analytical solution for the parameters based on modal decay rates. The physical process is governed by a linear reaction-diffusion equation.\n\nFirst, we combine the given physical laws into a single partial differential equation (PDE). We are given the mass conservation law, Fick's law of diffusion, and the first-order uptake kinetics:\n1. Mass conservation: $\\dfrac{\\partial C}{\\partial t} + \\dfrac{\\partial J}{\\partial x} = -R$\n2. Fick’s law: $J = -D \\dfrac{\\partial C}{\\partial x}$\n3. First-order uptake: $R = kC$\n\nSubstituting $J$ and $R$ into the conservation equation yields:\n$$\n\\dfrac{\\partial C}{\\partial t} + \\dfrac{\\partial}{\\partial x}\\left(-D \\dfrac{\\partial C}{\\partial x}\\right) = -kC\n$$\nAssuming the diffusivity $D$ is constant throughout the homogeneous tissue, this simplifies to the reaction-diffusion equation:\n$$\n\\dfrac{\\partial C}{\\partial t} = D \\dfrac{\\partial^2 C}{\\partial x^2} - kC\n$$\nThis PDE governs the concentration field $C(x,t)$ for $x \\in (0,L)$ and $t \\ge 0$. The boundary conditions are zero-flux (Neumann) at $x=0$ and $x=L$:\n$$\n\\dfrac{\\partial C}{\\partial x}(0,t) = 0 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\dfrac{\\partial C}{\\partial x}(L,t) = 0\n$$\n\n**Task 1: Formulation of the Variational Inverse Problem**\n\nThe inverse problem is to estimate the parameters $D$ and $k$ from a measured spatiotemporal concentration field, denoted here as $C_{data}(x,t)$. The governing PDE can be written in terms of a residual operator $\\mathcal{L}$ acting on the concentration field $C$ with parameters $(D,k)$:\n$$\n\\mathcal{L}(C; D, k) \\equiv \\dfrac{\\partial C}{\\partial t} - D \\dfrac{\\partial^2 C}{\\partial x^2} + kC = 0\n$$\nIf $C_{data}(x,t)$ were a perfect measurement of a true solution corresponding to parameters $(D, k)$, the residual $\\mathcal{L}(C_{data}; D, k)$ would be zero everywhere. Due to measurement noise and model error, it will be non-zero. The least-squares approach seeks to find the parameters $(D,k)$ that minimize the squared $L^2$-norm of this residual integrated over the spatiotemporal domain of measurement, say $(x,t) \\in [0,L] \\times [0,T]$.\n\nThe objective functional, based on the squared residual, is:\n$$\nJ_{LS}(D,k) = \\int_0^T \\int_0^L \\left( \\dfrac{\\partial C_{data}}{\\partial t} - D \\dfrac{\\partial^2 C_{data}}{\\partial x^2} + kC_{data} \\right)^2 dx \\, dt\n$$\nTo improve the stability and well-posedness of this inverse problem, Tikhonov regularization is added. This penalizes the magnitude of the parameters, which helps to prevent overfitting to noisy data and select a solution from a family of possible solutions. The regularization term is a weighted sum of the squared parameters:\n$$\nJ_{reg}(D,k) = \\alpha_D D^2 + \\alpha_k k^2\n$$\nwhere $\\alpha_D \\ge 0$ and $\\alpha_k \\ge 0$ are user-defined regularization weights.\n\nThe complete objective functional for the variational inverse problem is the sum of the least-squares and regularization terms:\n$$\nJ(D,k) = J_{LS}(D,k) + J_{reg}(D,k) = \\int_0^T \\int_0^L \\left( \\dfrac{\\partial C_{data}}{\\partial t} - D \\dfrac{\\partial^2 C_{data}}{\\partial x^2} + kC_{data} \\right)^2 dx \\, dt + \\alpha_D D^2 + \\alpha_k k^2\n$$\nFrom physical principles, both diffusivity and reaction rate must be non-negative. Therefore, the estimation is a constrained optimization problem:\n$$\n\\min_{D,k} J(D,k) \\quad \\text{subject to} \\quad D \\ge 0, \\quad k \\ge 0\n$$\nThis formulation defines the inverse problem as requested. The quantities $\\dfrac{\\partial C_{data}}{\\partial t}$ and $\\dfrac{\\partial^2 C_{data}}{\\partial x^2}$ are computed from the measured data $C_{data}(x,t)$, typically using numerical differentiation.\n\n**Task 2: Derivation of $D$ and $k$ from Modal Decay Rates**\n\nWe solve the PDE using the method of separation of variables. Let $C(x,t) = X(x)T(t)$. Substituting this into the PDE gives:\n$$\nX(x)T'(t) = D X''(x)T(t) - k X(x)T(t)\n$$\nDividing by $C(x,t) = X(x)T(t)$ and rearranging terms, we get:\n$$\n\\dfrac{T'(t)}{T(t)} + k = D \\dfrac{X''(x)}{X(x)} = -\\lambda_s\n$$\nwhere $-\\lambda_s$ is the separation constant. This leads to two ordinary differential equations (ODEs):\n1. Temporal ODE: $T'(t) + (k + \\lambda_s) T(t) = 0$\n2. Spatial ODE: $D X''(x) + \\lambda_s X(x) = 0$, or $X''(x) + \\frac{\\lambda_s}{D}X(x) = 0$\n\nThe boundary conditions on $C(x,t)$ translate to conditions on $X(x)$:\n$$\nX'(0) = 0 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad X'(L) = 0\n$$\nLet's define the spatial eigenvalue $\\lambda = \\lambda_s/D$. The spatial problem is a Sturm-Liouville eigenvalue problem:\n$$\nX''(x) + \\lambda X(x) = 0, \\quad \\text{with} \\quad X'(0)=0, \\, X'(L)=0\n$$\nThe general solution is $X(x) = A \\cos(\\sqrt{\\lambda}x) + B \\sin(\\sqrt{\\lambda}x)$.\nApplying $X'(0)=0$: $X'(x) = -A\\sqrt{\\lambda}\\sin(\\sqrt{\\lambda}x) + B\\sqrt{\\lambda}\\cos(\\sqrt{\\lambda}x)$. At $x=0$, this gives $B\\sqrt{\\lambda}=0$. For non-trivial solutions ($\\lambda \\ne 0$), we must have $B=0$.\nThe solution simplifies to $X(x) = A \\cos(\\sqrt{\\lambda}x)$.\nApplying $X'(L)=0$: $-A\\sqrt{\\lambda}\\sin(\\sqrt{\\lambda}L) = 0$. For non-trivial solutions ($A \\ne 0$), we require $\\sin(\\sqrt{\\lambda}L) = 0$.\nThis condition is satisfied if $\\sqrt{\\lambda}L = n\\pi$ for integer $n = 0, 1, 2, \\dots$.\nThe eigenvalues are $\\lambda_n = \\left(\\frac{n\\pi}{L}\\right)^2$, and the corresponding eigenfunctions (the Neumann eigenmodes) are $X_n(x) = \\cos\\left(\\frac{n\\pi x}{L}\\right)$.\n\nThe separation constants are $\\lambda_{s,n} = D\\lambda_n = D\\left(\\frac{n\\pi}{L}\\right)^2$.\nThe solution to the temporal ODE for each mode $n$ is $T_n(t) \\propto \\exp(-(k+\\lambda_{s,n})t)$.\nThe total decay rate for the $n$-th mode is thus:\n$$\n\\beta_n = k + \\lambda_{s,n} = k + D\\left(\\frac{n\\pi}{L}\\right)^2\n$$\nThe problem states that the experimentally measured decay rates for the $n=1$ and $n=2$ modes are $\\beta_1$ and $\\beta_2$. We can set up a system of two linear equations with two unknowns, $D$ and $k$:\n$$\n\\beta_1 = k + D\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{L}\\right)^2 \\quad (1)\n$$\n$$\n\\beta_2 = k + D\\left(\\frac{2\\pi}{L}\\right)^2 = k + D\\frac{4\\pi^2}{L^2} \\quad (2)\n$$\nTo find $D$, we subtract equation $(1)$ from equation $(2)$:\n$$\n\\beta_2 - \\beta_1 = \\left(k + D\\frac{4\\pi^2}{L^2}\\right) - \\left(k + D\\frac{\\pi^2}{L^2}\\right)\n$$\n$$\n\\beta_2 - \\beta_1 = D\\left(\\frac{4\\pi^2}{L^2} - \\frac{\\pi^2}{L^2}\\right) = D\\frac{3\\pi^2}{L^2}\n$$\nSolving for $D$:\n$$\nD = \\frac{L^2(\\beta_2 - \\beta_1)}{3\\pi^2}\n$$\nTo find $k$, we can substitute this expression for $D$ back into equation $(1)$:\n$$\nk = \\beta_1 - D\\frac{\\pi^2}{L^2} = \\beta_1 - \\left(\\frac{L^2(\\beta_2 - \\beta_1)}{3\\pi^2}\\right)\\frac{\\pi^2}{L^2}\n$$\n$$\nk = \\beta_1 - \\frac{\\beta_2 - \\beta_1}{3} = \\frac{3\\beta_1 - (\\beta_2 - \\beta_1)}{3} = \\frac{3\\beta_1 - \\beta_2 + \\beta_1}{3}\n$$\n$$\nk = \\frac{4\\beta_1 - \\beta_2}{3}\n$$\nThe final closed-form expressions for the parameters are:\n$$\nD = \\frac{L^2(\\beta_2 - \\beta_1)}{3\\pi^2} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad k = \\frac{4\\beta_1 - \\beta_2}{3}\n$$\nThe results are expressed as a single row matrix as requested.",
