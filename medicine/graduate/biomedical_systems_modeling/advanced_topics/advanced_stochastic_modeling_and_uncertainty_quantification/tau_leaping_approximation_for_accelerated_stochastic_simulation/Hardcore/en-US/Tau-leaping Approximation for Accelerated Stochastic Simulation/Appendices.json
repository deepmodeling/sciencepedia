            "solution": "First, we analyze the standard $\\tau$-leaping method for the given scenario to demonstrate its failure mode. The initial state is $(X_A(0), X_B(0)) = (100, 5)$. The propensity for the reaction $A + B \\to C$ is $a(X_A, X_B) = c\\,X_A\\,X_B$. At time $t=0$, the propensity is:\n$$ a(100, 5) = (0.003) \\times 100 \\times 5 = 1.5 $$\nFor a leap size of $\\tau = 8$, the mean of the Poisson distribution for the number of firings, $K(\\tau)$, is:\n$$ \\mu = a(X_A(0), X_B(0))\\,\\tau = 1.5 \\times 8 = 12 $$\nThus, the standard algorithm draws the number of firings from $K(\\tau) \\sim \\mathrm{Poisson}(12)$.\n\nEach reaction firing consumes one molecule of $A$ and one of $B$. To avoid negative populations, the number of firings $K(\\tau)$ must not exceed the number of available reactant molecules. This requires $K(\\tau) \\le X_A(0)$ and $K(\\tau) \\le X_B(0)$. The most stringent constraint comes from species $B$:\n$$ K(\\tau) \\le \\min\\{X_A(0), X_B(0)\\} = \\min\\{100, 5\\} = 5 $$\nThe maximum number of firings allowed is $m=5$. However, the algorithm draws from a Poisson distribution with a mean of 12. The probability of drawing a number $k > 5$ is very high. Any such draw results in an unphysical negative count for species B (e.g., if $K(\\tau)=10$, then $X_B(8) = 5 - 10 = -5$).\n\nThe problem requires selecting modifications that *guarantee* non-negativity for *any* realization.

Replace $K(\\tau)$ by $K^{\\star}(\\tau) = \\min\\{\\mathrm{Poisson}(a\\,\\tau),\\,m\\}$:**\n    This method, known as clipping, first draws a number $k$ from the Poisson distribution and then takes the minimum of $k$ and the non-negativity boundary $m$. By definition, $K^{\\star}(\\tau)$ can never be larger than $m$. This guarantees that the reactant counts will remain non-negative. This is a valid solution.\n\n*   **B. Replace $K(\\tau)$ by $K^{\\star}(\\tau) \\sim \\mathrm{Binomial}(m, p)$:**\n    This method models the reaction as a series of $m$ \"trials\" (where $m$ is the maximum possible number of reactions), each with a certain probability of success. A random variable drawn from a binomial distribution $\\mathrm{Binomial}(n, p)$ can only take integer values from $0$ to $n$. Here, $n=m$. Therefore, any realization of $K^{\\star}(\\tau)$ will be less than or equal to $m$. This guarantees non-negativity. This is also a valid solution and is often considered more physically motivated than clipping.\n\n*   **C. Keep $K(\\tau) \\sim \\mathrm{Poisson}(a\\,\\tau)$ but choose $\\tau$ so that $a\\,\\tau \\le m$:**\n    This only constrains the *mean* of the Poisson distribution. A Poisson random variable can take any non-negative integer value, regardless of its mean. Even if the mean $a\\tau$ is less than or equal to $m$, there is still a non-zero probability of drawing a value greater than $m$. This method reduces the chance of failure but does not provide a guarantee. This is not a valid solution.\n\n*   **D. Approximate $K(\\tau)$ by a Gaussian random variable:**\n    A Gaussian (normal) distribution is continuous and unbounded on the positive side. Although its mean is $a\\tau$, it can produce values much larger than $m$. The proposed clipping of negative values does not prevent draws greater than $m$. This method does not guarantee non-negativity. This is not a valid solution.\n\n*   **E. Partition reactions and select $\\tau$ to keep failure probability low:**\n    This approach aims to make the probability of generating a negative population, $\\mathbb{P}\\{K(\\tau) > m\\}$, smaller than a certain tolerance. While this makes failures rare, it does not eliminate them. The question asks for a guarantee for *any* realization, which this probabilistic approach does not provide.
