It is scientifically grounded in the principles of biochemical kinetics, well-posed with a unique and stable solution, and formulated with objective, unambiguous language. All necessary parameters are provided, and their values are physically plausible. We may therefore proceed with the solution.\n\nThe dynamics of the mRNA concentration, $m(t)$, and protein concentration, $p(t)$, are governed by ordinary differential equations (ODEs) derived from the principle of mass balance, which states that the rate of change of a species' concentration is the sum of its production rates minus the sum of its loss rates.\n\nFirst, we establish the ODE for the mRNA concentration, $m(t)$.\nThe production of mRNA is described as a constant, zeroth-order process with rate $k_{\\text{tx}}$.\nThe loss of mRNA occurs through two first-order processes: enzymatic degradation with rate constant $\\delta_m$ and dilution due to cell growth with specific growth rate $\\mu$. The total loss rate is thus $(\\delta_m + \\mu)m(t)$.\nCombining these terms, the ODE for $m(t)$ is:\n$$\n\\frac{dm}{dt} = \\text{production} - \\text{loss} = k_{\\text{tx}} - (\\delta_m + \\mu)m(t)\n$$\n\nNext, we establish the ODE for the protein concentration, $p(t)$.\nThe production of protein (translation) is a first-order process dependent on the mRNA concentration, occurring at a rate $k_{\\text{tl}}m(t)$.\nThe loss of protein, similar to mRNA, occurs through enzymatic degradation with rate constant $\\delta_p$ and dilution due to cell growth at rate $\\mu$. The total loss rate for the protein is $(\\delta_p + \\mu)p(t)$.\nCombining these terms, the ODE for $p(t)$ is:\n$$\n\\frac{dp}{dt} = \\text{production} - \\text{loss} = k_{\\text{tl}}m(t) - (\\delta_p + \\mu)p(t)\n$$\n\nThe problem requires the calculation of the unique steady-state concentrations, denoted as $m^{\\ast}$ and $p^{\\ast}$.

            "solution": "The problem asks for an analysis of the number and stability of equilibria for a synthetic genetic toggle switch model. The analysis must be based on nullcline geometry and linear stability theory.\n\nThe system of nondimensionalized ordinary differential equations is given by:\n$$\n\\frac{dx}{dt} = \\frac{\\alpha}{1 + y^{n}} - x\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{dy}{dt} = \\frac{\\alpha}{1 + x^{n}} - y\n$$\nwith the Hill coefficient specified as $n=2$. The system becomes:\n$$\n\\frac{dx}{dt} = \\frac{\\alpha}{1 + y^{2}} - x\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{dy}{dt} = \\frac{\\alpha}{1 + x^{2}} - y\n$$\nwhere $x$ and $y$ are nondimensional protein concentrations and must be non-negative, and $\\alpha  0$.\n\nEquilibria, or steady states, are points $(x^*, y^*)$ where the concentrations do not change over time. This occurs when both time derivatives are zero:\n$$\n\\frac{dx}{dt} = 0 \\implies x^* = \\frac{\\alpha}{1 + (y^*)^{2}}\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{dy}{dt} = 0 \\implies y^* = \\frac{\\alpha}{1 + (x^*)^{2}}\n$$\nThese equations define the nullclines of the system. The $x$-nullcline is the set of points where $\\frac{dx}{dt}=0$, given by the curve $x = \\frac{\\alpha}{1+y^2}$. The $y$-nullcline is the set of points where $\\frac{dy}{dt}=0$, given by the curve $y = \\frac{\\alpha}{1+x^2}$. The equilibria are the intersection points of these two nullclines.\n\nThe system is symmetric with respect to the exchange of variables $x$ and $y$. This implies that if $(x^*, y^*)$ is an equilibrium, then so is $(y^*, x^*)$. This symmetry guarantees at least one equilibrium must lie on the line of symmetry, $y=x$.\nTo find such a symmetric equilibrium, we set $y=x$ in one of the nullcline equations:\n$$\nx = \\frac{\\alpha}{1 + x^2}\n$$\nRearranging this gives a cubic equation for the symmetric equilibrium concentration $x$:\n$$\nx(1 + x^2) = \\alpha \\implies x^3 + x - \\alpha = 0\n$$\nLet $f(x) = x^3 + x - \\alpha$. The derivative is $f'(x) = 3x^2 + 1$. Since $x$ represents a concentration, $x$ is real, and thus $x^2 \\ge 0$. Therefore, $f'(x) > 0$ for all real $x$. This means $f(x)$ is a strictly monotonically increasing function. A strictly monotonic function can cross the horizontal axis at most once. Furthermore, since $f(0) = -\\alpha  0$ and $\\lim_{x\\to\\infty} f(x) = \\infty$, there must be exactly one positive real root, which we denote as $x_s$. Thus, for any $\\alpha  0$, there exists a unique symmetric equilibrium $(x_s, x_s)$.\n\nThe number of equilibria changes when the nullclines undergo a qualitative change in their intersection pattern. For this symmetric system, this occurs when the two nullclines become tangent to each other. Due to symmetry, this tangency must occur on the line $y=x$, at the symmetric equilibrium point. At a point of tangency $(x_c, y_c)$ where $x_c=y_c$, the slopes of the two nullcline curves must be equal.\n\nThe slope of the $y$-nullcline, $y(x) = \\frac{\\alpha}{1+x^2}$, is given by its derivative:\n$$\n\\frac{dy}{dx} = -\\frac{2\\alpha x}{(1+x^2)^2}\n$$\nThe $x$-nullcline, $x(y) = \\frac{\\alpha}{1+y^2}$, is a reflection of the $y$-nullcline across the line $y=x$. Its slope in the $(x,y)$-plane is $(\\frac{dx}{dy})^{-1}$. At a point on the line $y=x$, the slope of the $y$-nullcline is some value $m$. The slope of the $x$-nullcline will be $1/m$. For tangency, we might expect $m = 1/m \\implies m = \\pm 1$. However, this is not the condition. The condition for the creation or destruction of fixed points off the symmetry line $y=x$ (a pitchfork bifurcation) is that the slope of the nullcline $y(x)$ at the symmetric fixed point must be equal to the slope of the line of symmetry's perpendicular, which is $-1$.\n\nSo, the critical condition for tangency is $\\frac{dy}{dx} = -1$ at the symmetric equilibrium point $(x_c, x_c)$.\n$$\n-\\frac{2\\alpha x_c}{(1+x_c^2)^2} = -1 \\implies 2\\alpha x_c = (1+x_c^2)^2\n$$\nThis gives one equation relating the critical parameter $\\alpha_{\\text{crit}}$ and the corresponding critical equilibrium concentration $x_c$. The second equation is the equilibrium condition itself, evaluated at the critical point:\n$$\n\\alpha_{\\text{crit}} = x_c(1+x_c^2)\n$$\nSubstituting this expression for $\\alpha_{\\text{crit}}$ into the tangency condition:\n$$\n2 [x_c(1+x_c^2)] x_c = (1+x_c^2)^2\n$$\n$$\n2x_c^2(1+x_c^2) = (1+x_c^2)^2\n$$\nSince $x_c  0$, the term $(1+x_c^2)$ is non-zero, so we can divide by it:\n$$\n2x_c^2 = 1+x_c^2 \\implies x_c^2 = 1\n$$\nAs concentrations are non-negative, we take the positive root, $x_c=1$.\nSubstituting $x_c=1$ back into the equation for $\\alpha_{\\text{crit}}$:\n$$\n\\alpha_{\\text{crit}} = 1 \\cdot (1+1^2) = 2\n$$\nSo, the critical value of $\\alpha$ is $\\alpha_{\\text{crit}} = 2$.\n\nFor $\\alpha  \\alpha_{\\text{crit}} = 2$, the magnitude of the slope of the $y$-nullcline at the symmetric equilibrium is less than $1$. The nullclines intersect only once. Thus, there is $1$ equilibrium. We denote this number as $N_{}=1$.\nFor $\\alpha  \\alpha_{\\text{crit}} = 2$, the magnitude of the slope is greater than $1$. This causes the nullclines to intersect at two additional points, one on either side of the line $y=x$. Thus, there are $3$ equilibria. We denote this number as $N_{}=3$.\n\nNext, we analyze the linear stability of these equilibria using the Jacobian matrix of the system, evaluated at each equilibrium. The Jacobian matrix $J$ is:\n$$\nJ(x,y) = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}(\\frac{\\alpha}{1+y^2}-x)  \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}(\\frac{\\alpha}{1+y^2}-x) \\\\ \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}(\\frac{\\alpha}{1+x^2}-y)  \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}(\\frac{\\alpha}{1+x^2}-y) \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} -1  -\\frac{2\\alpha y}{(1+y^2)^2} \\\\ -\\frac{2\\alpha x}{(1+x^2)^2}  -1 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nAn equilibrium is linearly stable if all eigenvalues of the Jacobian evaluated at that point have negative real parts. This is guaranteed if the trace $\\text{tr}(J)  0$ and the determinant $\\det(J)  0$.\n\nLet's analyze the stability for $\\alpha  \\alpha_{\\text{crit}} = 2$.\nFirst, consider the symmetric equilibrium $(x_s, x_s)$. Here, $x_s^3 + x_s - \\alpha = 0$. Since $\\alpha  2$ and the function $f(x)=x^3+x$ is increasing, $x_s  1$.\nAt $(x_s, x_s)$, the Jacobian is:\n$$\nJ(x_s, x_s) = \\begin{pmatrix} -1  -\\frac{2\\alpha x_s}{(1+x_s^2)^2} \\\\ -\\frac{2\\alpha x_s}{(1+x_s^2)^2}  -1 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe trace is $\\text{tr}(J) = -2  0$.\nThe determinant is $\\det(J) = 1 - \\left(\\frac{2\\alpha x_s}{(1+x_s^2)^2}\\right)^2$.\nUsing the equilibrium condition $\\alpha = x_s(1+x_s^2)$, we can rewrite the off-diagonal term's magnitude:\n$$\n\\left|\\frac{2\\alpha x_s}{(1+x_s^2)^2}\\right| = \\frac{2x_s(1+x_s^2)x_s}{(1+x_s^2)^2} = \\frac{2x_s^2}{1+x_s^2}\n$$\nSince $x_s  1$, we have $x_s^2  1$. Let $u=x_s^2  1$. Then $\\frac{2u}{1+u}  1$ because $2u  1+u \\iff u1$.\nTherefore, the magnitude of the off-diagonal terms is greater than $1$.\nThis means $\\det(J) = 1 - (\\frac{2x_s^2}{1+x_s^2})^2  0$.\nAn equilibrium with a negative determinant has one positive and one negative eigenvalue, which corresponds to a saddle point. Saddle points are unstable. Thus, for $\\alpha  2$, there is $1$ saddle-type equilibrium, $U_{} = 1$.\n\nNow, consider the two asymmetric equilibria, $(x_a, y_a)$ and $(y_a, x_a)$, which exist for $\\alpha  2$.\nAt an asymmetric point $(x_a, y_a)$, the trace of the Jacobian is again $\\text{tr}(J) = -2  0$.\nThe determinant is:\n$$\n\\det(J) = 1 - \\left(-\\frac{2\\alpha y_a}{(1+y_a^2)^2}\\right)\\left(-\\frac{2\\alpha x_a}{(1+x_a^2)^2}\\right) = 1 - \\frac{4\\alpha^2 x_a y_a}{(1+x_a^2)^2(1+y_a^2)^2}\n$$\nUsing the equilibrium conditions $y_a = \\frac{\\alpha}{1+x_a^2}$ and $x_a = \\frac{\\alpha}{1+y_a^2}$:\n$$\n\\det(J) = 1 - \\frac{4 (y_a(1+x_a^2)) (x_a(1+y_a^2)) x_a y_a}{(1+x_a^2)^2(1+y_a^2)^2} = 1 - \\frac{4x_a^2 y_a^2}{(1+x_a^2)(1+y_a^2)}\n$$\nThe asymmetric equilibria are created via a supercritical pitchfork bifurcation, where the symmetric equilibrium loses stability. The two new equilibria that branch off are stable. This implies that for these points, $\\det(J)  0$.\nTo confirm, the bifurcation occurs when the slope of the composite map $\\phi(x) = \\frac{\\alpha}{1+(\\alpha/(1+x^2))^2}$ is $1$ at the symmetric fixed point. For the new stable fixed points that emerge, the slope must be less than $1$. The slope is $\\phi'(x) = g'(g(x))g'(x)$, where $g(x) = \\frac{\\alpha}{1+x^2}$. At the asymmetric fixed point $(x_a, y_a)$, $y_a=g(x_a)$, so $\\phi'(x_a) = g'(y_a)g'(x_a)$.\nThe determinant of the Jacobian at $(x_a,y_a)$ can be shown to be $1-\\phi'(x_a)$. Since $\\phi'(x_a)  1$ for the emergent stable branches, we have $\\det(J)  0$.\nWith $\\text{tr}(J) = -2  0$ and $\\det(J)  0$, the eigenvalues have negative real parts. Therefore, the two asymmetric equilibria are linearly stable. The number of stable equilibria is $S_{} = 2$.\n\nSummarizing the results:\n- For $\\alpha  \\alpha_{\\text{crit}}$, number of equilibria $N_{} = 1$.\n- For $\\alpha  \\alpha_{\\text{crit}}$, number of equilibria $N_{} = 3$.\n- For $\\alpha  \\alpha_{\\text{crit}}$, number of stable equilibria $S_{} = 2$.\n- For $\\alpha  \\alpha_{\\text{crit}}$, number of saddle equilibria $U_{} = 1$.\n- The critical value is $\\alpha_{\\text{crit}} = 2$.\n\nThe final answer is composed of these five values in the specified order.",

The deterministic vector field is $\\mathbf{F}(\\bar{\\mathbf{X}}) = (k_{\\text{tx}} - \\delta_m \\bar{M}, k_{\\text{tl}} \\bar{M} - \\delta_p \\bar{P})^{\\top}$.\nThe Jacobian is:\n$$\n\\mathbf{J} = \\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{F}}{\\partial \\bar{\\mathbf{X}}} \\bigg|_{\\bar{\\mathbf{X}}_{ss}} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\bar{M}}(k_{\\text{tx}} - \\delta_m \\bar{M})  \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\bar{P}}(k_{\\text{tx}} - \\delta_m \\bar{M}) \\\\ \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\bar{M}}(k_{\\text{tl}} \\bar{M} - \\delta_p \\bar{P})  \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\bar{P}}(k_{\\text{tl}} \\bar{M} - \\delta_p \\bar{P}) \\end{pmatrix}_{\\bar{\\mathbf{X}}_{ss}} = \\begin{pmatrix} -\\delta_m  0 \\\\ k_{\\text{tl}}  -\\delta_p \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nSince the deterministic system is linear, the Jacobian matrix is constant and does not depend on the steady-state values.\n\nThe diffusion matrix $\\mathbf{D}$ captures the magnitude of the stochastic noise. It is defined by the reaction stoichiometries $\\mathbf{s}_j$ and propensities $a_j(\\mathbf{X})$ as $\\mathbf{D} = \\sum_{j=1}^{4} \\mathbf{s}_j \\mathbf{s}_j^{\\top} a_j(\\bar{\\mathbf{X}}_{ss})$. We evaluate the propensities at the steady state:\n$a_{1}(\\bar{\\mathbf{X}}_{ss}) = k_{\\text{tx}}$\n$a_{2}(\\bar{\\mathbf{X}}_{ss}) = \\delta_m \\bar{M}_{ss} = \\delta_m (\\frac{k_{\\text{tx}}}{\\delta_m}) = k_{\\text{tx}}$\n$a_{3}(\\bar{\\mathbf{X}}_{ss}) = k_{\\text{tl}} \\bar{M}_{ss} = k_{\\text{tl}} (\\frac{k_{\\text{tx}}}{\\delta_m}) = \\frac{k_{\\text{tl}} k_{\\text{tx}}}{\\delta_m}$\n$a_{4}(\\bar{\\mathbf{X}}_{ss}) = \\delta_p \\bar{P}_{ss} = \\delta_p (\\frac{k_{\\text{tl}} k_{\\text{tx}}}{\\delta_m \\delta_p}) = \\frac{k_{\\text{tl}} k_{\\text{tx}}}{\\delta_m}$\n\nNow we construct the diffusion matrix:\n$$\n\\mathbf{D} = \\mathbf{s}_{1}\\mathbf{s}_{1}^{\\top} a_{1} + \\mathbf{s}_{2}\\mathbf{s}_{2}^{\\top} a_{2} + \\mathbf{s}_{3}\\mathbf{s}_{3}^{\\top} a_{3} + \\mathbf{s}_{4}\\mathbf{s}_{4}^{\\top} a_{4}\n$$\n$$\n\\mathbf{D} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}\\begin{pmatrix} 1  0 \\end{pmatrix} k_{\\text{tx}} + \\begin{pmatrix} -1 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}\\begin{pmatrix} -1  0 \\end{pmatrix} k_{\\text{tx}} + \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}\\begin{pmatrix} 0  1 \\end{pmatrix} \\frac{k_{\\text{tl}} k_{\\text{tx}}}{\\delta_m} + \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ -1 \\end{pmatrix}\\begin{pmatrix} 0  -1 \\end{pmatrix} \\frac{k_{\\text{tl}} k_{\\text{tx}}}{\\delta_m}\n$$\n$$\n\\mathbf{D} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1  0 \\\\ 0  0 \\end{pmatrix} k_{\\text{tx}} + \\begin{pmatrix} 1  0 \\\\ 0  0 \\end{pmatrix} k_{\\text{tx}} + \\begin{pmatrix} 0  0 \\\\ 0  1 \\end{pmatrix} \\frac{k_{\\text{tl}} k_{\\text{tx}}}{\\delta_m} + \\begin{pmatrix} 0  0 \\\\ 0  1 \\end{pmatrix} \\frac{k_{\\text{tl}} k_{\\text{tx}}}{\\delta_m}\n$$\n$$\n\\mathbf{D} = \\begin{pmatrix} 2k_{\\text{tx}}  0 \\\\ 0  \\frac{2k_{\\text{tl}} k_{\\text{tx}}}{\\delta_m} \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\n\nThe steady-state covariance matrix $\\mathbf{C}$ is the solution to the continuous-time algebraic Lyapunov equation, which represents a balance between the dissipation of fluctuations (due to the drift $\\mathbf{J}$) and the injection of noise (due to the diffusion $\\mathbf{D}$):\n$$\n\\mathbf{J} \\mathbf{C} + \\mathbf{C} \\mathbf{J}^{\\top} + \\mathbf{D} = \\mathbf{0}\n$$\nLet $\\mathbf{C} = \\begin{pmatrix} C_{11}  C_{12} \\\\ C_{21}  C_{22} \\end{pmatrix}$. Since $\\mathbf{C}$ is a covariance matrix, it is symmetric, so $C_{12} = C_{21}$. Substituting $\\mathbf{J}$, $\\mathbf{C}$, and $\\mathbf{D}$ into the Lyapunov equation:\n$$\n\\begin{pmatrix} -\\delta_m  0 \\\\ k_{\\text{tl}}  -\\delta_p \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} C_{11}  C_{12} \\\\ C_{12}  C_{22} \\end{pmatrix} + \\begin{pmatrix} C_{11}  C_{12} \\\\ C_{12}  C_{22} \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} -\\delta_m  k_{\\text{tl}} \\\\ 0  -\\delta_p \\end{pmatrix} + \\begin{pmatrix} 2k_{\\text{tx}}  0 \\\\ 0  \\frac{2k_{\\text{tl}}k_{\\text{tx}}}{\\delta_m} \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0  0 \\\\ 0  0 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nPerforming the matrix multiplications:\n$$\n\\begin{pmatrix} -\\delta_m C_{11}  -\\delta_m C_{12} \\\\ k_{\\text{tl}} C_{11} - \\delta_p C_{12}  k_{\\text{tl}} C_{12} - \\delta_p C_{22} \\end{pmatrix} + \\begin{pmatrix} -\\delta_m C_{11}  k_{\\text{tl}} C_{11} - \\delta_p C_{12} \\\\ -\\delta_m C_{12}  k_{\\text{tl}} C_{12} - \\delta_p C_{22} \\end{pmatrix} + \\begin{pmatrix} 2k_{\\text{tx}}  0 \\\\ 0  \\frac{2k_{\\text{tl}}k_{\\text{tx}}}{\\delta_m} \\end{pmatrix} = \\mathbf{0}\n$$\nCombining terms gives a system of algebraic equations for the components of $\\mathbf{C}$:\n$$\n\\begin{pmatrix} -2\\delta_m C_{11} + 2k_{\\text{tx}}  k_{\\text{tl}} C_{11} - (\\delta_m + \\delta_p)C_{12} \\\\ k_{\\text{tl}} C_{11} - (\\delta_m + \\delta_p)C_{12}  2k_{\\text{tl}} C_{12} - 2\\delta_p C_{22} + \\frac{2k_{\\text{tl}}k_{\\text{tx}}}{\\delta_m} \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0  0 \\\\ 0  0 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nEquating the matrix elements to $0$ yields:\n$1$.
