            "problem": "In systems biology, metabolic networks are often represented by a stoichiometric matrix, $S$. This matrix describes how metabolites are consumed and produced in a set of biochemical reactions. The rows of $S$ correspond to the metabolites, and the columns correspond to the reactions. An entry $S_{ij}$ is the stoichiometric coefficient of metabolite $i$ in reaction $j$; it is negative if the metabolite is a reactant and positive if it is a product.\n\nA central concept is the steady-state assumption, which posits that the concentrations of internal metabolites do not change over time. This condition can be expressed by the matrix equation $S \\cdot v = 0$, where $v$ is a column vector of reaction rates (or fluxes) for all the reactions in the network. A flux vector $v$ that satisfies this equation is called a steady-state flux distribution.\n\nConsider a simple hypothetical metabolic network with 3 internal metabolites (A, B, C) and 5 reactions ($v_1$ to $v_5$):\n- Reaction $v_1$: External source $\\rightarrow$ A\n- Reaction $v_2$: A $\\rightarrow$ B\n- Reaction $v_3$: B $\\rightarrow$ C\n- Reaction $v_4$: C $\\rightarrow$ A\n- Reaction $v_5$: B $\\rightarrow$ External sink\n\nThe stoichiometric matrix $S$ for this network, with rows corresponding to metabolites A, B, and C, and columns to reactions $v_1$ through $v_5$, is given by:\n$$\nS = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & -1 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 & -1 & 0 & -1 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 1 & -1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\n\nWhich of the following flux vectors represent a valid steady-state flux distribution for this network?

Consider a hypothetical metabolic network involving two internal metabolites, X and Y. The network consists of three irreversible enzymatic reactions, $R_1$, $R_2$, and $R_3$. The dynamics of the internal metabolites are described by the stoichiometric matrix $S$, where the rows correspond to metabolites (in the order X, Y) and the columns correspond to reactions (in the order $R_1, R_2, R_3$):\n$$\nS = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & -1 & -1 \\\\ -1 & 1 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nA flux vector $v = [v_1, v_2, v_3]^T$ describes the rates of these three reactions.

The solution process is as follows: first, validate the problem statement; second, solve the problem by finding the nullspace of the stoichiometric matrix, applying constraints to identify the extreme rays of the flux cone, normalizing the resulting EFMs, and finally calculating the sum of their norms.\n\n### Step 1: Problem Validation\n\nThe givens are:\n- Internal metabolites: $A$, $B$, $C$.\n- Irreversible reactions: $R_1$, $R_2$, $R_3$, $R_4$, $R_5$.\n- Stoichiometric matrix: $S = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & -1 & 0 & 0 & -1 \\\\ 0 & 1 & -1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 1 & -1 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$.\n- Flux constraints: $v_i \\geq 0$ for $i \\in \\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5\\}$.\n- Steady-state condition: $S v = 0$, where $v \\in \\mathbb{R}^5$ is the flux vector.\n- Definition of the steady-state flux cone: $\\{v \\in \\mathbb{R}^5 \\mid S v = 0, v \\geq 0\\}$.\n- Definition of an EFM: A minimal-support extreme ray of this cone.\n- Normalization condition: The uptake flux $v_1$ must equal $1$.\n- Final calculation: The sum of the $L_1$ norms of the normalized EFMs.\n\nThe problem is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. It presents a standard task in metabolic pathway analysis using established definitions and concepts like stoichiometric matrices, steady-state flux cones, and EFMs. The provided data is complete and consistent. Therefore, the problem is deemed valid.\n\n### Step 2: Deriving the EFMs\n\nThe core of the problem is to find the extreme rays of the convex polyhedral cone defined by the system of linear equations and inequalities:\n1. $S v = 0$\n2. $v \\geq 0$ (component-wise)\n\nFirst, we find a basis for the nullspace of $S$. The condition $S v = 0$ corresponds to the following system of linear equations, where $v = (v_1, v_2, v_3, v_4, v_5)^T$:\n$$\n\\begin{cases}\nv_1 - v_2 - v_5 = 0 \\\\\nv_2 - v_3 = 0 \\\\\nv_3 - v_4 + v_5 = 0\n\\end{cases}\n$$\nThe rank of the matrix $S$ is $3$. The dimension of the nullspace is $n - \\text{rank}(S) = 5 - 3 = 2$. We choose $v_4$ and $v_5$ as free variables. Let's express the other variables in terms of them.\n\nFrom the second equation, we have $v_2 = v_3$.\nFrom the third equation, we have $v_3 = v_4 - v_5$.\nTherefore, $v_2 = v_4 - v_5$.\nSubstituting these into the first equation:\n$v_1 - (v_4 - v_5) - v_5 = 0 \\implies v_1 - v_4 + v_5 - v_5 = 0 \\implies v_1 = v_4$.\n\nLet the free variables be parameterized by $t_1$ and $t_2$:\n$v_4 = t_1$\n$v_5 = t_2$\n\nThen the dependent variables are:\n$v_1 = t_1$\n$v_2 = t_1 - t_2$\n$v_3 = t_1 - t_2$\n\nThe general solution for a vector $v$ in the nullspace of $S$ can be written as:\n$$\nv = \\begin{pmatrix} v_1 \\\\ v_2 \\\\ v_3 \\\\ v_4 \\\\ v_5 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} t_1 \\\\ t_1 - t_2 \\\\ t_1 - t_2 \\\\ t_1 \\\\ t_2 \\end{pmatrix} = t_1 \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 1 \\\\ 1 \\\\ 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix} + t_2 \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ -1 \\\\ -1 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nwhere $t_1, t_2 \\in \\mathbb{R}$.\n\nNext, we apply the irreversibility constraints $v_i \\ge 0$ for all $i \\in \\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5\\}$:\n1. $v_1 = t_1 \\ge 0$\n2. $v_2 = t_1 - t_2 \\ge 0 \\implies t_1 \\ge t_2$\n3. $v_3 = t_1 - t_2 \\ge 0$ (redundant with the previous)\n4. $v_4 = t_1 \\ge 0$ (redundant with the first and second constraints)\n5. $v_5 = t_2 \\ge 0$\n\nCombining these inequalities on the parameters $t_1$ and $t_2$, we find the feasible region defining the flux cone: $t_1 \\ge t_2 \\ge 0$. This is a cone in the $(t_1, t_2)$ parameter space, bounded by the rays $t_2 = 0$ (where $t_1 > 0$) and $t_1 = t_2$ (where $t_1, t_2 > 0$).\n\nThe extreme rays of the steady-state flux cone correspond to the boundaries of this feasible region in the parameter space. We find a generator for each boundary ray:\n1. For the boundary $t_2 = 0$: we can choose a point such as $(t_1, t_2) = (1, 0)$. This gives the first extreme ray, $e_1$:\n$$\ne_1 = 1 \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 1 \\\\ 1 \\\\ 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix} + 0 \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ -1 \\\\ -1 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 1 \\\\ 1 \\\\ 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\n2. For the boundary $t_1 = t_2$: we can choose a point such as $(t_1, t_2) = (1, 1)$. This gives the second extreme ray, $e_2$:\n$$\ne_2 = 1 \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 1 \\\\ 1 \\\\ 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix} + 1 \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ -1 \\\\ -1 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 1 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThese vectors $e_1$ and $e_2$ are the Elementary Flux Modes (EFMs) of the network. They have minimal support, as the support of $e_1$ is $\\{1, 2, 3, 4\\}$ and the support of $e_2$ is $\\{1, 4, 5\\}$, and neither is a subset of the other.\n\n### Step 3: Normalization and Final Calculation\n\nThe problem requires normalizing each EFM so that the uptake flux $v_1$ equals $1$. The reaction $R_1$ is the sole uptake reaction as it is the only one producing an internal metabolite from the exterior (its column in $S$ has a positive entry for metabolite $A$ and zeros otherwise).\nFor $EFM_1 = e_1$, the first component is $v_1 = 1$. The EFM is already normalized.\nFor $EFM_2 = e_2$, the first component is $v_1 = 1$. This EFM is also already normalized.\n\nLet the normalized EFMs be $e'_1$ and $e'_2$.\n$e'_1 = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 1 \\\\ 1 \\\\ 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}$\n$e'_2 = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 1 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\nFinally, we compute the sum of the $L_1$ norms of these normalized EFMs. The $L_1$ norm of a vector $x \\in \\mathbb{R}^n$ is $\\|x\\|_1 = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} |x_i|$. Since all flux values are non-negative, the absolute value is redundant.\n\nThe $L_1$ norm of $e'_1$ is:\n$$\n\\|e'_1\\|_1 = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 0 = 4\n$$\nThe $L_1$ norm of $e'_2$ is:\n$$\n\\|e'_2\\|_1 = 1 + 0 + 0 + 1 + 1 = 3\n$$\nThe sum of the $L_1$ norms is:\n$$\n\\text{Sum} = \\|e'_1\\|_1 + \\|e'_2\\|_1 = 4 + 3 = 7\n$$\nThe final answer is an exact integer.",
