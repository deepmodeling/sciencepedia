            "problem": "You are given a cytosolic subnetwork involving glycolytic and fermentative steps with explicit stoichiometric coefficients. The stoichiometric matrix $S$ maps reaction fluxes to metabolite accumulation rates according to the mass balance definition $\\frac{d\\boldsymbol{x}}{dt} = S \\boldsymbol{v}$, where $\\boldsymbol{x}$ is the vector of metabolite concentrations and $\\boldsymbol{v}$ is the vector of reaction fluxes. In a homogeneous, closed compartment with no exchange fluxes, steady state implies $\\frac{d\\boldsymbol{x}}{dt} = \\boldsymbol{0}$.\n\nUse the following metabolite ordering for the rows of $S$:\n- $\\mathrm{PEP}$ (phosphoenolpyruvate),\n- $\\mathrm{Pyruvate}$,\n- $\\mathrm{Lactate}$,\n- $\\mathrm{NAD}^{+}$ (oxidized nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide),\n- $\\mathrm{NADH}$ (reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide),\n- $\\mathrm{ATP}$ (adenosine triphosphate),\n- $\\mathrm{ADP}$ (adenosine diphosphate),\n- $\\mathrm{Pi}$ (inorganic phosphate),\n- $\\mathrm{H}^{+}$ (hydrogen ion).\n\nThe reaction columns (in order $R_{1}$ through $R_{5}$) are defined by the following chemically plausible reactions, with stoichiometric coefficients as indicated.

            "solution": "The problem requires the determination of the number of independent degrees of freedom in a metabolic network at steady state. This quantity is equivalent to the dimension of the null space of the stoichiometric matrix $S$. The analysis proceeds in two main steps: first, the construction of the matrix $S$ from the provided reaction definitions, and second, the calculation of the dimension of its null space.\n\nThe system is described by the mass balance equation $\\frac{d\\boldsymbol{x}}{dt} = S \\boldsymbol{v}$, where $\\boldsymbol{x}$ is the vector of metabolite concentrations and $\\boldsymbol{v}$ is the vector of reaction fluxes. At steady state, the concentrations of metabolites are constant, so $\\frac{d\\boldsymbol{x}}{dt} = \\boldsymbol{0}$. This leads to the system of linear equations $S \\boldsymbol{v} = \\boldsymbol{0}$. The number of independent degrees of freedom in the flux vector $\\boldsymbol{v}$ is the number of linearly independent vectors $\\boldsymbol{v}$ that satisfy this equation, which is precisely the dimension of the null space of $S$, denoted as $\\text{dim}(\\text{Null}(S))$.\n\n**Step 1: Assembling the Stoichiometric Matrix $S$**\n\nThe matrix $S$ has dimensions $m \\times n$, where $m=9$ is the number of metabolites and $n=5$ is the number of reactions. The rows correspond to the metabolites in the specified order: $\\mathrm{PEP}$, $\\mathrm{Pyruvate}$, $\\mathrm{Lactate}$, $\\mathrm{NAD}^{+}$, $\\mathrm{NADH}$, $\\mathrm{ATP}$, $\\mathrm{ADP}$, $\\mathrm{Pi}$, $\\mathrm{H}^{+}$. The columns correspond to the reactions $R_1$ through $R_5$. The entries of the matrix are the stoichiometric coefficients, with reactants assigned negative signs and products assigned positive signs.\n\nReaction $R_1$: $\\mathrm{PEP} + \\mathrm{ADP} \\to \\mathrm{Pyruvate} + \\mathrm{ATP}$\nThe column vector for $R_1$ is constructed by assigning a coefficient of $-1$ to the reactants ($\\mathrm{PEP}$, $\\mathrm{ADP}$) and $+1$ to the products ($\\mathrm{Pyruvate}$, $\\mathrm{ATP}$). All other metabolite coefficients are $0$.\n$$ \\boldsymbol{s}_1 = \\begin{pmatrix} -1 \\\\ 1 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 1 \\\\ -1 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix} $$\n\nReaction $R_2$: $\\mathrm{Pyruvate} + \\mathrm{NADH} + \\mathrm{H}^{+} \\to \\mathrm{Lactate} + \\mathrm{NAD}^{+}$\nThe reactants ($\\mathrm{Pyruvate}$, $\\mathrm{NADH}$, $\\mathrm{H}^{+}$) receive a coefficient of $-1$, and the products ($\\mathrm{Lactate}$, $\\mathrm{NAD}^{+}$) receive a coefficient of $+1$.\n$$ \\boldsymbol{s}_2 = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ -1 \\\\ 1 \\\\ 1 \\\\ -1 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ -1 \\end{pmatrix} $$\n\nReaction $R_3$: $\\mathrm{ATP} \\to \\mathrm{ADP} + \\mathrm{Pi} + \\mathrm{H}^{+}$\nThe reactant ($\\mathrm{ATP}$) gets a coefficient of $-1$, and the products ($\\mathrm{ADP}$, $\\mathrm{Pi}$, $\\mathrm{H}^{+}$) get a coefficient of $+1$.\n$$ \\boldsymbol{s}_3 = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ -1 \\\\ 1 \\\\ 1 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix} $$\n\nReaction $R_4$: $\\mathrm{ADP} + \\mathrm{Pi} + \\mathrm{H}^{+} \\to \\mathrm{ATP}$\nThis is the reverse reaction of $R_3$. The reactants ($\\mathrm{ADP}$, $\\mathrm{Pi}$, $\\mathrm{H}^{+}$) get a coefficient of $-1$, and the product ($\\mathrm{ATP}$) gets a coefficient of $+1$.\n$$ \\boldsymbol{s}_4 = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 1 \\\\ -1 \\\\ -1 \\\\ -1 \\end{pmatrix} $$\n\nReaction $R_5$: $\\mathrm{Lactate} + \\mathrm{NAD}^{+} \\to \\mathrm{Pyruvate} + \\mathrm{NADH} + \\mathrm{H}^{+}$\nThis reaction is the reverse of $R_2$. The reactants ($\\mathrm{Lactate}$, $\\mathrm{NAD}^{+}$) get a coefficient of $-1$, and the products ($\\mathrm{Pyruvate}$, $\\mathrm{NADH}$, $\\mathrm{H}^{+}$) get a coefficient of $+1$.\n$$ \\boldsymbol{s}_5 = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 1 \\\\ -1 \\\\ -1 \\\\ 1 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix} $$\n\nCombining these column vectors, the complete stoichiometric matrix $S$ is:\n$$ S = \\begin{pmatrix} -1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 1 & -1 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\\\ 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & -1 \\\\ 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & -1 \\\\ 0 & -1 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 & -1 & 1 & 0 \\\\ -1 & 0 & 1 & -1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 1 & -1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 & 1 & -1 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} $$\nThe sign convention has been verified for each column during its construction.\n\n**Step 2: Determining the Degrees of Freedom**\n\nThe number of degrees of freedom is $\\text{dim}(\\text{Null}(S))$. According to the rank-nullity theorem, for a matrix $S$ with $n$ columns, we have:\n$$ \\text{dim}(\\text{Null}(S)) + \\text{rank}(S) = n $$\nHere, $n=5$ (the number of reactions). Therefore, the number of degrees of freedom is $5 - \\text{rank}(S)$. We must determine the rank of $S$, which is the number of linearly independent columns.\n\nLet's inspect the columns of $S$ for linear dependencies.\nComparing columns $\\boldsymbol{s}_3$ and $\\boldsymbol{s}_4$:\n$$ \\boldsymbol{s}_3 + \\boldsymbol{s}_4 = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ -1 \\\\ 1 \\\\ 1 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix} + \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 1 \\\\ -1 \\\\ -1 \\\\ -1 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix} $$\nThus, $\\boldsymbol{s}_3 + \\boldsymbol{s}_4 = \\boldsymbol{0}$, which means they are linearly dependent. Reaction $R_4$ is the exact reverse of $R_3$.\n\nComparing columns $\\boldsymbol{s}_2$ and $\\boldsymbol{s}_5$:\n$$ \\boldsymbol{s}_2 + \\boldsymbol{s}_5 = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ -1 \\\\ 1 \\\\ 1 \\\\ -1 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ -1 \\end{pmatrix} + \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 1 \\\\ -1 \\\\ -1 \\\\ 1 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix} $$\nThus, $\\boldsymbol{s}_2 + \\boldsymbol{s}_5 = \\boldsymbol{0}$, indicating another linear dependency. Reaction $R_5$ is stoichiometrically the reverse of $R_2$.\n\nDue to these two dependencies, the set of five column vectors $\\{\\boldsymbol{s}_1, \\boldsymbol{s}_2, \\boldsymbol{s}_3, \\boldsymbol{s}_4, \\boldsymbol{s}_5\\}$ spans the same space as the set $\\{\\boldsymbol{s}_1, \\boldsymbol{s}_2, \\boldsymbol{s}_3\\}$. The rank of $S$ is the number of linearly independent vectors in this smaller set. To check for their independence, we solve the equation $c_1 \\boldsymbol{s}_1 + c_2 \\boldsymbol{s}_2 + c_3 \\boldsymbol{s}_3 = \\boldsymbol{0}$ for scalars $c_1, c_2, c_3$.\n\nWriting this out in matrix form:\n$$ \\begin{pmatrix} -1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 1 & -1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 & 0 \\\\ 1 & 0 & -1 \\\\ -1 & 0 & 1 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 1 \\\\ 0 & -1 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} c_1 \\\\ c_2 \\\\ c_3 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix} $$\nFrom the first row (corresponding to $\\mathrm{PEP}$), we get $-1 \\cdot c_1 + 0 \\cdot c_2 + 0 \\cdot c_3 = 0$, which implies $c_1 = 0$.\nSubstituting $c_1 = 0$ into the system, the second row (for $\\mathrm{Pyruvate}$) gives $0 - 1 \\cdot c_2 + 0 \\cdot c_3 = 0$, which implies $c_2 = 0$.\nSubstituting $c_1=0$ and $c_2=0$ into the system, the eighth row (for $\\mathrm{Pi}$) gives $0 \\cdot c_1 + 0 \\cdot c_2 + 1 \\cdot c_3 = 0$, which implies $c_3 = 0$.\n\nSince the only solution is $c_1 = c_2 = c_3 = 0$, the vectors $\\boldsymbol{s}_1, \\boldsymbol{s}_2, \\boldsymbol{s}_3$ are linearly independent. Therefore, the rank of the matrix $S$ is $3$.\n$$ \\text{rank}(S) = 3 $$\n\nNow, using the rank-nullity theorem, we can find the dimension of the null space:\n$$ \\text{dim}(\\text{Null}(S)) = n - \\text{rank}(S) = 5 - 3 = 2 $$\nThe number of independent degrees of freedom in the reaction flux vector is $2$. This corresponds to two independent pathways, or cycles, that can carry a net flux at steady state. In this case, they correspond to the reversible reaction pairs $(R_2, R_5)$ and $(R_3, R_4)$.",

            "solution": "The problem requires the computation of a canonical integer basis for the left null space of given stoichiometric matrices $S$. This space, denoted $\\ker(S^T)$, corresponds to the set of conserved moiety pools in a biochemical reaction network.

This invariance condition, $\\frac{d}{dt}(y^T x) = 0$, translates to the linear-algebraic condition $y^T S = 0$, or equivalently, $S^T y = 0$. Our task is to find all linearly independent vectors $y$ that satisfy this condition and represent them in a canonical integer form.\n\nThe solution proceeds through a sequence of discrete, formal steps: (1) solving the system of homogeneous linear equations $S^T y = 0$ using exact rational arithmetic, (2) extracting a basis for the solution space (the kernel), and (3) normalizing this basis to a canonical integer representation.\n\n**1. Theoretical Foundation: Solving $A y = 0$**\n\nFor each given stoichiometric matrix $S \\in \\mathbb{Z}^{m \\times n}$, we define the matrix $A = S^T \\in \\mathbb{Z}^{n \\times m}$. The problem is now to find the null space (kernel) of $A$, i.e., all vectors $y \\in \\mathbb{R}^m$ such that $A y = 0$. The standard and definitive method for this, which avoids numerical instabilities and provides exact solutions, is Gauss-Jordan elimination. By transforming $A$ into its Reduced Row Echelon Form (RREF), we obtain an equivalent, but simpler, system of linear equations from which the basis of the null space can be directly read.\n\nThe problem's insistence on exact rational arithmetic is crucial. Floating-point arithmetic would introduce approximation errors, making it impossible to uniquely recover the minimal integer coefficients that define a moiety pool. Therefore, all calculations must be performed over the field of rational numbers, $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n\n**2. Algorithmic Design**\n\nThe overall algorithm is as follows:\n\n**Step A: Computation of the Reduced Row Echelon Form (RREF)**\nGiven the matrix $A = S^T$, we compute its RREF using Gauss-Jordan elimination. The matrix elements are treated as rational numbers to ensure precision. The algorithm proceeds by iterating through columns, identifying a pivot element in each, and using row operations to create a leading $1$ in the pivot position and $0$s elsewhere in the pivot's column.\n1.  Initialize the pivot row index, $p_{row}$, to $0$. Iterate through each column $j$ from $0$ to $m-1$.\n2.  Find a non-zero entry in column $j$ at or below row $p_{row}$. If one exists at row $i$, swap rows $i$ and $p_{row}$.\n3.  If no such non-zero entry exists, column $j$ is a free column; continue to the next column.\n4.  Normalize the new pivot row (row $p_{row}$) by dividing it by the value of the pivot element, making the pivot a $1$.\n5.  Eliminate all other non-zero entries in column $j$ by subtracting suitable multiples of the pivot row from other rows.\n6.  Increment $p_{row}$. If $p_{row}$ reaches the total number of rows, the algorithm terminates.\n\n**Step B: Extraction of the Kernel Basis**\nThe RREF of $A$ allows for the parameterization of the solution space.\n1.  Identify the pivot columns (those containing a leading $1$ for some row) and the free columns (all other columns). The dimension of $\\ker(A)$ is equal to the number of free columns.\n2.  If there are no free columns, the kernel is the trivial subspace $\\{0\\}$, and its basis is the empty set.\n3.  For each free column $j$, construct a basis vector $y^{(j)}$. Initialize it as a zero vector of size $m$. Set its $j$-th component to $1$. The components of $y^{(j)}$ corresponding to other free columns are set to $0$.\n4.  The values for the pivot variable components are determined by the entries in the RREF matrix. For each pivot row $i$ with a pivot in column $p_i$, the $p_i$-th component of the basis vector $y^{(j)}$ is given by the negative of the entry in the RREF at position $(i, j)$.\n\nThis process generates a set of linearly independent vectors that span $\\ker(A)$.\n\n**Step C: Canonical Integer Normalization**\nEach rational basis vector must be converted to a unique, canonical integer representation. For each rational vector $y^{(i)}$:\n1.  **Clear Denominators**: Find the least common multiple (LCM) of the denominators of all its components. Multiply the entire vector by this LCM to obtain a vector with integer entries.\n2.  **Find Minimal Integers**: Compute the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the absolute values of all non-zero integer components. Divide the vector by this GCD.\n3.  **Fix Orientation**: Check the first non-zero element of the resulting vector. If it is negative, multiply the entire vector by $-1$. This ensures a canonical sign.\n\n**Step D: Final Basis Assembly**\nThe resulting list of normalized integer basis vectors is then sorted lexicographically. This ensures that the final output is deterministic and canonical for any given input matrix $S$.\n\n**3. Application to Test Cases**\n\nLet's apply this procedure to the provided matrices.\n\n**Case 1: $S_1$**\n$S_1 = \\begin{bmatrix} -1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 1 & -1 & 1 \\\\ 0 & 1 & -1 \\end{bmatrix}$. We form $A = S_1^T = \\begin{bmatrix} -1 & 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 & 1 \\\\ 0 & 1 & -1 \\end{bmatrix}$.\nThe RREF of $A$ is $\\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 & -1 \\\\ 0 & 1 & -1 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\end{bmatrix}$.\nThe system of equations is $y_1 - y_3 = 0$ and $y_2 - y_3 = 0$.\nThe pivot variables are $y_1$ and $y_2$; the free variable is $y_3$.\nSetting the free variable $y_3 = 1$ yields $y_1 = 1$ and $y_2 = 1$.\nThe single basis vector is $y^{(1)} = (1, 1, 1)^T$. This vector is already in minimal, positive integer form. The canonical basis is $\\{[1, 1, 1]\\}$. This corresponds to the conservation of the total adenylate pool: $[\\text{ATP}] + [\\text{ADP}] + [\\text{AMP}] = \\text{constant}$.\n\n**Case 2: $S_2$**\n$S_2 = \\begin{bmatrix} -1 & 0 \\\\ 1 & -1 \\end{bmatrix}$. We form $A = S_2^T = \\begin{bmatrix} -1 & 1 \\\\ 0 & -1 \\end{bmatrix}$.\nThe RREF of $A$ is the identity matrix $I_2 = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{bmatrix}$.\nThe system of equations is $y_1 = 0$ and $y_2 = 0$.\nThere are no free variables. The only solution is the trivial solution $y = (0, 0)^T$.\nThe kernel is $\\{0\\}$, so its basis is the empty set.\n\n**Case 3: $S_3$**\n$S_3 = \\begin{bmatrix} -1 \\\\ 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{bmatrix}$. We form $A = S_3^T = \\begin{bmatrix} -1 & 1 & 0 \\end{bmatrix}$.\nThe RREF of $A$ is $\\begin{bmatrix} 1 & -1 & 0 \\end{bmatrix}$.\nThe system of equations is $y_1 - y_2 = 0$.\nThe pivot variable is $y_1$; the free variables are $y_2$ and $y_3$. The kernel dimension is $2$.\n1.  Let $y_2=1, y_3=0$. Then $y_1 = y_2 = 1$. The basis vector is $y^{(1)} = (1, 1, 0)^T$.\n2.  Let $y_2=0, y_3=1$. Then $y_1 = y_2 = 0$. The basis vector is $y^{(2)} = (0, 0, 1)^T$.\nBoth vectors, $[1, 1, 0]$ and $[0, 0, 1]$, are already in canonical integer form.\nSorting them lexicographically, $[0, 0, 1]$ precedes $[1, 1, 0]$.\nThe canonical basis is $\\{[0, 0, 1], [1, 1, 0]\\}$. These correspond to the conservation of metabolite $M_3$ (which is not part of any reaction) and the conservation of the total pool of $M_1$ and $M_2$.",
