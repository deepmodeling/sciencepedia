            "problem": "Consider steady-state constraint-based modeling of a closed intracellular network with no exchange, uptake, secretion, or demand reactions. Under Flux Balance Analysis (FBA), the mass balance constraints are written as $S v = 0$, where $S \\in \\mathbb{R}^{m \\times n}$ is the stoichiometric matrix of $m$ internal metabolites and $n$ reactions, and $v \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n}$ is the reaction flux vector subject to standard feasibility bounds and directionality constraints.\n\nConstruct a minimal, scientifically plausible closed network with $m = 3$ internal metabolites $\\{X, Y, Z\\}$ and $n = 2$ internal reactions given by isomerizations:\n- $R_{1}$: $X \\rightarrow Y$,\n- $R_{2}$: $Y \\rightarrow Z$.\n\nWrite down the stoichiometric matrix $S$ for this network in the metabolite order $(X, Y, Z)$ and reaction order $(R_{1}, R_{2})$.

            "solution": "The problem requires the analysis of a minimal, closed metabolic network under the steady-state assumption of Flux Balance Analysis (FBA). The core principle of FBA is that for a system at steady state, the concentration of each internal metabolite remains constant. This is expressed by the mass balance equation $S v = 0$, where $S$ is the stoichiometric matrix and $v$ is the vector of reaction fluxes.\n\nFirst, we construct the stoichiometric matrix $S \\in \\mathbb{R}^{3 \\times 2}$ for the given network. The rows of $S$ correspond to the metabolites in the order $(X, Y, Z)$, and the columns correspond to the reactions in the order $(R_{1}, R_{2})$.\n\nThe reactions are:\n1.  $R_{1}$: $1X \\rightarrow 1Y$\n2.  $R_{2}$: $1Y \\rightarrow 1Z$\n\nThe entries $S_{ij}$ of the matrix represent the stoichiometric coefficient of metabolite $i$ in reaction $j$. By convention, reactants have negative coefficients and products have positive coefficients.\n\nFor reaction $R_{1}$, one mole of metabolite $X$ is consumed ($-1$), and one mole of metabolite $Y$ is produced ($+1$). Metabolite $Z$ is not involved ($0$). This gives the first column of $S$:\n$$\nv_{R_1} = \\begin{pmatrix} -1 \\\\ 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\n\nFor reaction $R_{2}$, one mole of metabolite $Y$ is consumed ($-1$), and one mole of metabolite $Z$ is produced ($+1$). Metabolite $X$ is not involved ($0$). This gives the second column of $S$:\n$$\nv_{R_2} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ -1 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\n\nCombining these columns, the stoichiometric matrix $S$ is:\n$$\nS = \\begin{pmatrix} -1  0 \\\\ 1  -1 \\\\ 0  1 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\n\nNext, we apply the steady-state constraint $S v = 0$, where $v = \\begin{pmatrix} v_{1} \\\\ v_{2} \\end{pmatrix}$ is the flux vector for reactions $R_{1}$ and $R_{2}$ respectively. This matrix equation corresponds to a system of linear equations:\n$$\n\\begin{pmatrix} -1  0 \\\\ 1  -1 \\\\ 0  1 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} v_{1} \\\\ v_{2} \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\n\nWriting out the system of equations, one for each metabolite's mass balance:\n1.  For metabolite $X$: $-1 \\cdot v_{1} + 0 \\cdot v_{2} = 0 \\implies -v_{1} = 0 \\implies v_{1} = 0$.\n2.  For metabolite $Y$: $1 \\cdot v_{1} - 1 \\cdot v_{2} = 0 \\implies v_{1} - v_{2} = 0$.\n3.  For metabolite $Z$: $0 \\cdot v_{1} + 1 \\cdot v_{2} = 0 \\implies v_{2} = 0$.\n\nFrom the first equation, we find $v_{1} = 0$. From the third equation, we find $v_{2} = 0$. Substituting these values into the second equation gives $0 - 0 = 0$, which is consistent. Thus, the only solution to the system of linear equations is $v_{1} = 0$ and $v_{2} = 0$. This solution satisfies the given feasibility bounds $0 \\leq v_{i}  \\infty$. The unique steady-state flux vector is therefore the zero vector, $v = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}$.\n\nTo explain this result rigorously using linear algebra, we analyze the null space (or kernel) of the matrix $S$. The set of all valid steady-state flux vectors is, by definition, the null space of $S$. The dimension of the null space, or nullity, determines the number of independent flux distributions the network can support.\n\nThe columns of $S$ are the vectors $c_1 = \\begin{pmatrix} -1  1  0 \\end{pmatrix}^T$ and $c_2 = \\begin{pmatrix} 0  -1  1 \\end{pmatrix}^T$. To determine if they are linearly independent, we seek non-trivial solutions to the equation $k_{1}c_{1} + k_{2}c_{2} = 0$. This gives the system:\n$$\n-k_{1} = 0 \\\\\nk_{1} - k_{2} = 0 \\\\\nk_{2} = 0\n$$\nThe only solution is $k_{1} = 0$ and $k_{2} = 0$. Since the only linear combination of the columns that equals the zero vector is the trivial one, the columns are linearly independent. The rank of a matrix is the dimension of its column space, which is equal to the number of linearly independent columns. Therefore, the rank of $S$ is $\\text{rank}(S) = 2$.\n\nAccording to the rank-nullity theorem, for a matrix $S \\in \\mathbb{R}^{m \\times n}$, we have $\\text{rank}(S) + \\text{nullity}(S) = n$, where $n$ is the number of columns (reactions). In our case, $n=2$. Substituting the rank we found:\n$$\n2 + \\text{nullity}(S) = 2\n$$\nThis implies that $\\text{nullity}(S) = 0$. A null space of dimension $0$ contains only one element: the zero vector. Therefore, the only flux vector $v$ that satisfies $S v = 0$ is $v = 0$.\n\nThe physical interpretation of this result is that in a closed and acyclic network, there can be no sustained, non-zero flux at steady state. Metabolite $X$ is consumed by $R_{1}$, but since the system is closed, there is no reaction or external source producing $X$. For the concentration of $X$ to be constant (steady state), the net rate of its production must be zero. This requires the flux $v_{1}$ through the reaction consuming it to be zero. Similarly, metabolite $Z$ is produced by $R_{2}$, but no reaction or external sink consumes it. For the concentration of $Z$ to be constant, it cannot accumulate, meaning the flux $v_{2}$ through the reaction producing it must also be zero.\n\nTo obtain a non-zero steady-state flux, the mass balance must be satisfied for every metabolite. This is possible only if the system is \"opened\" by adding exchange reactions. For instance, a source reaction for $X$ (e.g., $R_{in}: \\emptyset \\rightarrow X$) and a sink or demand reaction for $Z$ (e.g., $R_{out}: Z \\rightarrow \\emptyset$) would modify the mass balance equations for $X$ and $Z$ to $v_{in} - v_{1} = 0$ and $v_{2} - v_{out} = 0$, respectively. The balance for the internal metabolite $Y$ remains $v_{1} - v_{2} = 0$. This new system allows for a non-trivial solution $v_{1} = v_{2} = v_{in} = v_{out}$. A non-zero influx ($v_{in}  0$) can propagate through the pathway and exit ($v_{out}  0$) while maintaining a perfect balance for all internal metabolites, thereby satisfying the steady-state condition with non-zero internal fluxes. Thus, in an acyclic network, exchange reactions are a necessity for sustaining non-zero steady-state flux.",

The formulation is scientifically sound.\n- **Well-Posedness**: The problem asks for the minimum and maximum value of a linear function ($z = v_2$) over a feasible region defined by a set of linear equalities ($S v = 0$) and inequalities (the flux bounds). This constitutes a pair of linear programming problems. The feasible region, known as a flux cone or polytope, is convex. Since the constraints are not contradictory (as will be shown in the solution), a well-defined solution exists.\n- **Objectivity**: The problem is specified using precise mathematical language and quantitative data. It is free of ambiguity or subjective claims.\n\nThe problem is self-contained and mathematically consistent. No rules from the invalid problem checklist are violated.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is deemed **valid**. A solution will be provided.\n\nThe steady-state mass balance condition is given by the matrix equation $S v = 0$. Writing this out for the given stoichiometric matrix $S$ and flux vector $v$, we obtain a system of three linear equations:\n$$\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n1  -1  -1  0  0 \\\\\n0  1  0  -1  0 \\\\\n0  0  1  0  -1\n\\end{pmatrix}\n\\begin{pmatrix}\nv_1 \\\\ v_2 \\\\ v_3 \\\\ v_4 \\\\ v_5\n\\end{pmatrix}\n=\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0\n\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThis system corresponds to the following individual mass balances for metabolites $a$, $b$, and $c$:\n1.  Metabolite $a$: $v_{1} - v_{2} - v_{3} = 0$\n2.  Metabolite $b$: $v_{2} - v_{4} = 0$\n3.  Metabolite $c$: $v_{3} - v_{5} = 0$\n\nFrom equations (2) and (3), we can express fluxes $v_{2}$ and $v_{3}$ in terms of $v_{4}$ and $v_{5}$, respectively:\n$v_{2} = v_{4}$\n$v_{3} = v_{5}$\n\nSubstituting these relations into equation (1) gives an expression for $v_{1}$:\n$v_{1} = v_{2} + v_{3} = v_{4} + v_{5}$\n\nNow, we must find the range of $v_2$ that is consistent with both these stoichiometric constraints and the given flux bounds. We will systematically combine the bounds.\n\nThe relation $v_{2} = v_{4}$ implies that any feasible value for $v_{2}$ must also be a feasible value for $v_{4}$, and vice-versa. The given bounds are $0 \\leq v_{2} \\leq 100$ and $3 \\leq v_{4} \\leq 10$. For $v_{2} = v_{4}$ to hold, the value must lie in the intersection of these two intervals.\n$$ v_{2}, v_{4} \\in [0, 100] \\cap [3, 10] = [3, 10] $$\nThus, we have a new, tighter constraint on both $v_{2}$ and $v_{4}$:\n$3 \\leq v_{2} \\leq 10$ and $3 \\leq v_{4} \\leq 10$.\n\nSimilarly, for the relation $v_{3} = v_{5}$, the given bounds are $0 \\leq v_{3} \\leq 100$ and $5 \\leq v_{5} \\leq 9$. The value must lie in the intersection of these two intervals.\n$$ v_{3}, v_{5} \\in [0, 100] \\cap [5, 9] = [5, 9] $$\nThis yields the tighter constraints:\n$5 \\leq v_{3} \\leq 9$ and $5 \\leq v_{5} \\leq 9$.\n\nFinally, we consider the constraint on $v_{1}$, which is $0 \\leq v_{1} \\leq 12$. Using the relation $v_{1} = v_{2} + v_{3}$, we have:\n$0 \\leq v_{2} + v_{3} \\leq 12$.\nSince the established ranges for $v_2$ and $v_3$ are $v_{2} \\geq 3$ and $v_{3} \\geq 5$, the sum $v_{2} + v_{3}$ will always be greater than or equal to $3+5=8$. Thus, the lower bound $v_{2} + v_{3} \\geq 0$ is automatically satisfied. The effective constraint becomes:\n$v_{2} + v_{3} \\leq 12$.\n\nOur task is to find the feasible interval for $v_{2}$, which is equivalent to finding the minimum and maximum values of $v_{2}$ subject to the following set of constraints:\n1.  $3 \\leq v_{2} \\leq 10$\n2.  $5 \\leq v_{3} \\leq 9$\n3.  $v_{2} + v_{3} \\leq 12$\n\nTo find the maximum possible value for $v_{2}$, denoted $v_{2}^{\\max}$, we rearrange the third constraint as $v_{2} \\leq 12 - v_{3}$. To maximize $v_{2}$, the value of $v_{3}$ must be minimized. From the second constraint, the minimum possible value for $v_{3}$ is $5$.\nSubstituting $v_{3} = 5$ into the inequality:\n$v_{2} \\leq 12 - 5 \\implies v_{2} \\leq 7$.\nThis condition must be satisfied along with $3 \\leq v_2 \\leq 10$. The intersection of $v_{2} \\leq 7$ and $v_{2} \\in [3, 10]$ is $v_{2} \\in [3, 7]$. The maximum value in this range is $7$.\nThus, $v_{2}^{\\max} = 7$. We confirm that a flux state with $v_2=7$ exists: set $v_2=7$ and $v_3=5$. This gives $v_1=12$, $v_4=7$, $v_5=5$. All these values are within their respective allowed bounds.\n\nTo find the minimum possible value for $v_{2}$, denoted $v_{2}^{\\min}$, we look at the constraint $3 \\leq v_2 \\leq 10$. The lowest possible value is $3$. We must check if $v_{2}=3$ is compatible with the existence of a valid $v_{3}$.\nIf $v_{2} = 3$, the constraints on $v_{3}$ become:\n1.  $5 \\leq v_{3} \\leq 9$\n2.  $3 + v_{3} \\leq 12 \\implies v_{3} \\leq 9$\nCombining these, we require a $v_{3}$ such that $v_{3} \\in [5, 9] \\cap (-\\infty, 9] = [5, 9]$. Since this interval is non-empty (e.g., $v_{3}=5$ is a valid choice), a feasible flux distribution with $v_{2}=3$ exists.\nThus, $v_{2}^{\\min} = 3$.\n\nThe feasible interval for the flux $v_{2}$ is $[v_{2}^{\\min}, v_{2}^{\\max}] = [3, 7]$. The units for these flux values are millimoles per gram dry weight per hour ($\\text{mmol} \\cdot \\text{gDW}^{-1} \\cdot \\text{h}^{-1}$).\nThe endpoints of the feasible interval for $v_2$ are $v_{2}^{\\min} = 3 \\, \\text{mmol} \\cdot \\text{gDW}^{-1} \\cdot \\text{h}^{-1}$ and $v_{2}^{\\max} = 7 \\, \\text{mmol} \\cdot \\text{gDW}^{-1} \\cdot \\text{h}^{-1}$.",

Other bounds default.\n- **Output**: A JSON-like list string `[[E1,P1,G1],[E2,P2,G2],...]` where $E$ is the list of essential reaction indices, $P$ is the list of synthetic lethal pairs (as lists of indices), and $G$ is the baseline growth rounded to three decimal places.\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\n- **Scientifically Grounded**: The problem is based on Flux Balance Analysis, a standard and well-established method in systems biology and metabolic engineering. The network topology is a simple, plausible representation of a branched metabolic pathway. The concepts of reaction essentiality and synthetic lethality are central to the field. The problem is scientifically sound.\n- **Well-Posed**: The problem is formulated as a Linear Program (LP), which is a well-posed mathematical problem. For a given set of linear constraints (equalities from $Sv=0$ and inequalities from flux bounds), an optimal solution for a linear objective is guaranteed to exist because the feasible space (a polytope) is closed and bounded. The procedure for identifying essentiality and synthetic lethality is algorithmic and unambiguous.\n- **Objective**: The problem is stated in precise, formal language without subjective or opinion-based claims.\n- **Incomplete or Contradictory Setup**: The problem is self-contained. The slight notational dissonance between $v_6$ and the 0-based index $v_5$ is a minor ambiguity, readily resolved by context to mean \"the flux of the 6th reaction, which is at index 5\". It does not render the problem invalid.\n- **Unrealistic or Infeasible**: The network and flux bounds are simplified but are not physically impossible or scientifically implausible for a modeling context.\n- **Ill-Posed or Poorly Structured**: The problem is well-structured, guiding the user through a standard FBA workflow: baseline analysis, single knockouts, and double knockouts.\n- **Conclusion**: The problem is valid, scientifically sound, and well-posed.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. A solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution Design\n\nThe core of the solution is a function that solves a linear program for the FBA problem. This function will be called multiple times with different flux bounds to simulate the wild-type (baseline) condition and various reaction knockouts.\n\nThe LP formulation is:\nMaximize $c^T v$\nSubject to:\n$S v = 0$\n$l_b \\le v \\le u_b$\n\nUsing 0-based indexing, the vector of fluxes is $v = [v_0, v_1, v_2, v_3, v_4, v_5]^T$. The objective is to maximize $v_5$, so the objective vector is $c = [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]^T$. Most standard LP solvers, including `scipy.optimize.linprog`, perform minimization. Therefore, we will minimize $-c^T v$, which corresponds to an objective vector for the solver of $c_{min} = [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, -1]^T$.\n\nThe equality constraints are given by the $4 \\times 6$ stoichiometric matrix $S$ and a right-hand side vector of zeros, $b_{eq} = [0, 0, 0, 0]^T$. The bounds $l_b$ and $u_b$ are vectors defining the lower and upper limits for each flux, respectively. Since all reactions are irreversible, the lower bound for all fluxes is $0$. The upper bounds are provided in the problem description and test cases.\n\nThe overall algorithm for each test case is as follows:\n1.  **Baseline Analysis**:\n    -   Define the flux bounds for the wild-type network based on the test case.\n    -   Solve the LP: $\\max v_5$ subject to $Sv=0$ and wild-type bounds. Let the result be $G_{base}$.\n    -   If $G_{base}  \\varepsilon = 10^{-9}$, the result for this case is `[[], [], G_base]`, and we proceed to the next case.\n\n2.  **Essentiality Analysis**:\n    -   Initialize an empty list, `essential_reactions`.\n    -   For each reaction $i$ from $0$ to $5$:\n        -   Create a new set of bounds by taking the wild-type bounds and setting the upper bound for $v_i$ to $0$ (effectively, $v_i=0$).\n        -   Solve the LP with these knockout bounds. Let the result be $G_i$.\n        -   If $G_i  \\varepsilon$, add index $i$ to `essential_reactions`.\n\n3.  **Synthetic Lethality Analysis**:\n    -   Initialize an empty list, `synthetic_lethal_pairs`.\n    -   Identify the candidate reactions for pairs, which are those with indices $\\{1, 2, 3, 4\\}$.\n    -   Iterate through all unique pairs of indices $(i, j)$ from this candidate set.\n    -   For each pair $(i, j)$:\n        -   Check if reaction $i$ or reaction $j$ was previously found to be essential. If so, this pair cannot be synthetic lethal by definition, so we skip it.\n        -   Create a new set of bounds by taking the wild-type bounds and setting the upper bounds for both $v_i$ and $v_j$ to $0$.\n        -   Solve the LP with these double-knockout bounds. Let the result be $G_{ij}$.\n        -   If $G_{ij}  \\varepsilon$, add the pair $[i, j]$ (sorted for canonical representation) to `synthetic_lethal_pairs`.\n\n4.  **Final Output Assembly**:\n    -   Combine the lists of essential reactions, synthetic lethal pairs, and the rounded baseline growth $G_{base}$ into the specified format for the current test case.\n    -   After processing all test cases, concatenate the results into a single string as required.\n\nThis systematic procedure will be implemented in Python using the `numpy` library for matrix and vector operations and the `scipy.optimize.linprog` function to solve the LP problems.",
