            "solution": "The problem statement is evaluated to be scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. It provides a complete and consistent set of data from the field of clinical epidemiology, allowing for a unique and meaningful solution. All provided values are realistic for the specified medical context. Therefore, the problem is valid and a solution will be provided.\n\nLet $D$ be the event that a patient has cutaneous leishmaniasis and $D^c$ be the event that a patient does not have the disease. Let $T^+$ be the event that the microscopy test result is positive and $T^-$ be the event that the test result is negative.\n\nFrom the problem statement, we are given the following probabilities:\nThe prevalence of the disease is $P(D) = 0.20$.\nThe sensitivity of the test is the probability of a positive test given the disease is present: $P(T^+|D) = 0.70$.\nThe specificity of the test is the probability of a negative test given the disease is absent: $P(T^-|D^c) = 0.95$.\n\nFrom these given probabilities, we can deduce the probabilities of the complementary events:\nThe probability of not having the disease is $P(D^c) = 1 - P(D) = 1 - 0.20 = 0.80$.\nThe probability of a false negative, i.e., a negative test in a patient with the disease, is $P(T^-|D) = 1 - P(T^+|D) = 1 - 0.70 = 0.30$.\nThe probability of a false positive, i.e., a positive test in a patient without the disease, is $P(T^+|D^c) = 1 - P(T^-|D^c) = 1 - 0.95 = 0.05$.\n\nThe task is to compute the positive predictive value (PPV) and the negative predictive value (NPV), starting from fundamental definitions.\n\nFirst, we determine the Positive Predictive Value (PPV). The PPV is defined as the probability that a patient has the disease given that the test result is positive, which is $P(D|T^+)$.\nUsing the fundamental definition of conditional probability, $P(A|B) = \\frac{P(A \\cap B)}{P(B)}$, we have:\n$$PPV = P(D|T^+) = \\frac{P(D \\cap T^+)}{P(T^+)}$$\nThe numerator, $P(D \\cap T^+)$, is the probability of having the disease and testing positive (a true positive). From the definition of conditional probability, $P(T^+|D) = \\frac{P(D \\cap T^+)}{P(D)}$, so we can write $P(D \\cap T^+) = P(T^+|D)P(D)$.\nThe denominator, $P(T^+)$, is the total probability of a positive test. Using the law of total probability, we can express this as the sum of probabilities of true positives and false positives:\n$$P(T^+) = P(T^+ \\cap D) + P(T^+ \\cap D^c)$$\nUsing the definition of conditional probability again, this becomes:\n$$P(T^+) = P(T^+|D)P(D) + P(T^+|D^c)P(D^c)$$\nCombining these expressions for the numerator and denominator, we derive the formula for PPV:\n$$PPV = \\frac{P(T^+|D)P(D)}{P(T^+|D)P(D) + P(T^+|D^c)P(D^c)}$$\nSubstituting the numerical values:\n$$PPV = \\frac{(0.70)(0.20)}{(0.70)(0.20) + (0.05)(0.80)} = \\frac{0.14}{0.14 + 0.04} = \\frac{0.14}{0.18}$$\n$$PPV = 0.7777...$$\nRounding to four significant figures, $PPV = 0.7778$.\n\nNext, we determine the Negative Predictive Value (NPV). The NPV is defined as the probability that a patient does not have the disease given that the test result is negative, which is $P(D^c|T^-)$.\nUsing the fundamental definition of conditional probability:\n$$NPV = P(D^c|T^-) = \\frac{P(D^c \\cap T^-)}{P(T^-)}$$\nThe numerator, $P(D^c \\cap T^-)$, is the probability of not having the disease and testing negative (a true negative). From the definition of conditional probability, $P(T^-|D^c) = \\frac{P(D^c \\cap T^-)}{P(D^c)}$, so we have $P(D^c \\cap T^-) = P(T^-|D^c)P(D^c)$.\nThe denominator, $P(T^-)$, is the total probability of a negative test. Using the law of total probability, this is the sum of probabilities of true negatives and false negatives:\n$$P(T^-) = P(T^- \\cap D^c) + P(T^- \\cap D)$$\nUsing the definition of conditional probability, this becomes:\n$$P(T^-) = P(T^-|D^c)P(D^c) + P(T^-|D)P(D)$$\nCombining these expressions, we derive the formula for NPV:\n$$NPV = \\frac{P(T^-|D^c)P(D^c)}{P(T^-|D^c)P(D^c) + P(T^-|D)P(D)}$$\nSubstituting the numerical values:\n$$NPV = \\frac{(0.95)(0.80)}{(0.95)(0.80) + (0.30)(0.20)} = \\frac{0.76}{0.76 + 0.06} = \\frac{0.76}{0.82}$$\n$$NPV = 0.926829...$$\nRounding to four significant figures, $NPV = 0.9268$.\n\nThe problem also asks to report the sensitivity and specificity numerically.\nSensitivity is given as $70\\%$, which is $0.70$. To four significant figures, this is $0.7000$.\nSpecificity is given as $95\\%$, which is $0.95$. To four significant figures, this is $0.9500$.\n\nThe four quantities, rounded to four significant figures, are:\nSensitivity: $0.7000$\nSpecificity: $0.9500$\nPositive Predictive Value (PPV): $0.7778$\nNegative Predictive Value (NPV): $0.9268$",

            "problem": "A patient residing in a tropical endemic region presents with a single ulcerative plaque clinically consistent with cutaneous leishmaniasis. The lesion is well demarcated and, on careful measurement along orthogonal axes, has a major axis of length $3$ cm and a minor axis of length $2$ cm.

Use the fundamental geometric definition of the area of an ellipse in terms of its semi-axes to compute the lesion’s surface area.\n\nClinical practice guidelines, such as those of the World Health Organization (WHO) and the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO), commonly permit local therapies (for example, cryotherapy, thermotherapy, or intralesional antimonial injections) for lesions that satisfy a size criterion based on the maximum diameter.

            "solution": "The problem statement is subjected to validation.\n\n### Step 1: Extract Givens\n- A lesion is modeled as an ellipse.\n- Major axis length: $3$ cm.\n- Minor axis length: $2$ cm.\n- Semi-major axis is half the major axis.\n- Semi-minor axis is half the minor axis.\n- The area of an ellipse is to be computed using its semi-axes.\n- Eligibility for local therapy is determined by the maximum diameter, $D_{\\max}$.\n- The eligibility criterion is $D_{\\max} \\leq 3 \\text{ cm}$.\n- The eligibility indicator $I$ is defined as $I=1$ if $D_{\\max} \\leq 3 \\text{ cm}$ and $I=0$ otherwise.\n- The required outputs are:\n    1.

The dimensions are plausible. The concept of using size criteria for treatment decisions is standard in medicine. The problem is free of pseudoscience and factual errors.\n- **Well-Posed**: The problem is clearly defined with all necessary information to compute the two requested values.

It provides all data (axis lengths) and definitions (formulas for semi-axes, definition of $I$) required for the solution. There are no contradictions.\n- **Realism**: The physical dimensions and clinical context are realistic.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. It is a well-posed, scientifically grounded problem that can be solved using the provided information and standard geometric principles.\n\n### Solution\nThe problem requires the computation of two quantities: the area of an elliptical lesion and an eligibility indicator based on its maximum diameter.\n\nFirst, we determine the semi-major and semi-minor axes of the ellipse. Let the length of the major axis be $L_{maj}$ and the length of the minor axis be $L_{min}$. The problem states:\n$$L_{maj} = 3 \\text{ cm}$$\n$$L_{min} = 2 \\text{ cm}$$\n\nThe semi-major axis, denoted by $a$, is half the length of the major axis.\n$$a = \\frac{L_{maj}}{2} = \\frac{3}{2} \\text{ cm} = 1.5 \\text{ cm}$$\n\nThe semi-minor axis, denoted by $b$, is half the length of the minor axis.\n$$b = \\frac{L_{min}}{2} = \\frac{2}{2} \\text{ cm} = 1 \\text{ cm}$$\n\nThe area $A$ of an ellipse is given by the fundamental formula:\n$$A = \\pi a b$$\n\nSubstituting the values for $a$ and $b$:\n$$A = \\pi (1.5 \\text{ cm})(1 \\text{ cm}) = 1.5\\pi \\text{ cm}^2$$\n\nThe problem requires the area to be rounded to four significant figures. We compute the numerical value:\n$$A \\approx 1.5 \\times 3.14159265... \\text{ cm}^2 \\approx 4.71238898... \\text{ cm}^2$$\n\nRounding this value to four significant figures yields:\n$$A \\approx 4.712 \\text{ cm}^2$$\n\nSecond, we determine the eligibility indicator $I$. The indicator depends on the maximum diameter of the lesion, $D_{\\max}$. For an ellipse, the maximum diameter is the length of its major axis.\n$$D_{\\max} = L_{maj} = 3 \\text{ cm}$$\n\nThe eligibility criterion is given as $D_{\\max} \\leq 3 \\text{ cm}$. We test this condition with our value for $D_{\\max}$:\n$$3 \\text{ cm} \\leq 3 \\text{ cm}$$\nThis inequality is true.\n\nThe eligibility indicator $I$ is defined as $I = 1$ if the condition is met and $I = 0$ otherwise. Since the condition is met, the value of the indicator is:\n$$I = 1$$\n\nThe final answer is to be expressed as a row matrix containing the computed area $A$ and the indicator $I$. The two values are $A \\approx 4.712$ and $I=1$.",

            "solution": "The problem is assessed to be valid. It is scientifically grounded in clinical pharmacology and tropical medicine, well-posed with sufficient data for both the calculation and the formulation of a monitoring plan, and objective in its language. The problem consists of two parts: a quantitative calculation and a qualitative proposal for clinical monitoring.\n\n**Part 1: Calculation of Total Cumulative Dose**\n\nThe total cumulative dose of pentavalent antimony ($Sb^V$), denoted as $D_{total}$, is calculated based on the prescribed dose rate, the patient's body weight, and the duration of therapy.\n\nThe given parameters are:\n- Dose rate, $D_{rate} = 20\\,\\mathrm{mg}\\,\\mathrm{kg}^{-1}\\,\\mathrm{day}^{-1}$\n- Patient weight, $m = 60\\,\\mathrm{kg}$\n- Duration of therapy, $T = 20\\,\\mathrm{days}$\n\nFirst, the daily dose, $D_{daily}$, is calculated by multiplying the dose rate by the patient's weight.\n$$D_{daily} = D_{rate} \\times m$$\nSubstituting the given values into the equation:\n$$D_{daily} = \\left(20\\,\\frac{\\mathrm{mg}}{\\mathrm{kg} \\cdot \\mathrm{day}}\\right) \\times (60\\,\\mathrm{kg}) = 1200\\,\\frac{\\mathrm{mg}}{\\mathrm{day}}$$\n\nNext, the total cumulative dose in milligrams, $D_{total, mg}$, is found by multiplying the daily dose by the total duration of the therapy, as per the assumption of linear accumulation.\n$$D_{total, mg} = D_{daily} \\times T$$\nSubstituting the calculated daily dose and the given duration:\n$$D_{total, mg} = \\left(1200\\,\\frac{\\mathrm{mg}}{\\mathrm{day}}\\right) \\times (20\\,\\mathrm{days}) = 24000\\,\\mathrm{mg}$$\n\nThe problem requires the final answer to be in grams ($g$). Using the specified conversion factor, $1000\\,\\mathrm{mg} = 1\\,\\mathrm{g}$, we convert the total dose from milligrams to grams.\n$$D_{total, g} = \\frac{D_{total, mg}}{1000\\,\\mathrm{mg/g}}$$\n$$D_{total, g} = \\frac{24000\\,\\mathrm{mg}}{1000\\,\\mathrm{mg/g}} = 24\\,\\mathrm{g}$$\n\nFinally, the problem requires rounding the final answer to four significant figures. To express the integer $24$ with four significant figures, it is written as $24.00$.\n\n**Part 2: Rational Monitoring Approach**\n\nA rational monitoring approach is crucial for early detection of the known toxicities associated with sodium stibogluconate, allowing for intervention before the onset of severe adverse events. The plan must include baseline assessments and periodic surveillance throughout the treatment regimen.\n\n1.  **Cardiotoxicity ($QTc$ Prolongation)**:\n    - **Test**: $12$-lead Electrocardiogram (ECG).\n    - **Schedule**: A baseline ECG is required to establish the pre-treatment corrected QT interval ($QTc$). Due to the risk of potentially fatal arrhythmias such as Torsades de Pointes, weekly monitoring with an ECG (e.g., on day $7$ and day $14$) is a prudent measure. A final ECG at the end of treatment (day $20$) is also recommended. Any patient-reported symptoms like palpitations or syncope must prompt an immediate ECG.\n\n2.  **Hepatotoxicity (Transaminitis)**:\n    - **Test**: Liver Function Tests (LFTs), including Aspartate Aminotransferase (AST) and Alanine Aminotransferase (ALT).\n    - **Schedule**: Baseline LFTs must be obtained before starting therapy. These should be repeated weekly (e.g., on day $7$, day $14$) and at the conclusion of treatment (day $20$). Therapy should be interrupted if AST or ALT levels rise to $\\ge 5\\times$ the upper limit of normal or if signs of symptomatic hepatitis appear.\n\n3.  **Pancreatic Toxicity (Pancreatitis)**:\n    - **Test**: Serum pancreatic enzymes, specifically lipase and amylase.\n    - **Schedule**: Baseline lipase and amylase levels are necessary. These should be monitored weekly (day $7$, day $14$) and at the end of treatment (day $20$). The drug should be held if enzyme levels rise to $\\ge 3\\times$ the upper limit of normal, particularly if the patient develops associated symptoms like abdominal pain.\n\n4.  **Renal Toxicity (Kidney Injury)**:\n    - **Test**: Serum creatinine.\n    - **Schedule**: A baseline serum creatinine level is essential to assess initial renal function. This parameter should be monitored weekly (day $7$, day $14$) and at the end of treatment (day $20$). Therapy should be paused if creatinine rises to $\\ge 2\\times$ the baseline value.\n\n5.  **Hematologic Toxicity (Cytopenias)**:\n    - **Test**: Complete Blood Count (CBC) with differential.\n    - **Schedule**: A baseline CBC is required to assess initial hemoglobin, white blood cell count, and platelet count. The CBC should be repeated weekly (day $7$, day $14$) and at the end of treatment (day $20$) to screen for anemia, leukopenia, or thrombocytopenia.\n\nIn summary, a comprehensive monitoring plan consists of a panel of tests (ECG, LFTs, pancreatic enzymes, serum creatinine, CBC) conducted at baseline, repeated weekly during the $20$-day treatment, and performed once more upon completion of the course. This systematic surveillance facilitates the timely application of the specified toxicity thresholds, ensuring patient safety.",
