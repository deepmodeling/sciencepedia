It contains no invalidating flaws. Therefore, it is deemed **valid**, and a solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution Derivation\nThe problem asks for the expected carrier frequency of a rare autosomal recessive disorder in a population under specific assumptions. The assumptions stated—a large, randomly mating population with no mutation, migration, or selection—are the conditions for the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE).\n\nAccording to the principles of HWE, if we consider a single gene locus with two alleles, a wild-type allele with frequency $p$ and a mutant allele with frequency $q$, the allele frequencies in the population remain constant from generation to generation. The relationship between these allele frequencies is given by:\n$$p + q = 1$$\n\nThe genotype frequencies in the population can be predicted from the allele frequencies. For an autosomal locus, the genotype frequencies at equilibrium are given by the terms of the binomial expansion of $(p+q)^2$:\n-   Frequency of homozygous wild-type individuals: $p^2$\n-   Frequency of heterozygous individuals (carriers): $2pq$\n-   Frequency of homozygous recessive individuals (affected, given complete penetrance): $q^2$\n\nThe sum of these genotype frequencies must equal $1$:\n$$p^2 + 2pq + q^2 = (p+q)^2 = 1^2 = 1$$\n\nThe problem states that the prevalence of this autosomal recessive EB subtype is $\\frac{1}{100,000}$. It also specifies that this prevalence equals the frequency of homozygous recessives. Therefore, we have:\n$$q^2 = \\frac{1}{100,000} = 10^{-5}$$\n\nFrom this, we can calculate the frequency of the mutant allele, $q$:\n$$q = \\sqrt{q^2} = \\sqrt{10^{-5}}$$\n\nOur goal is to find the carrier frequency, which is defined as the proportion of heterozygotes, $2pq$. First, we must find the frequency of the wild-type allele, $p$:\n$$p = 1 - q = 1 - \\sqrt{10^{-5}}$$\n\nNow, we can substitute the expressions for $p$ and $q$ into the formula for the carrier frequency:\n$$\\text{Carrier Frequency} = 2pq = 2 \\left(1 - \\sqrt{10^{-5}}\\right) \\sqrt{10^{-5}}$$\nThis expression can be simplified as:\n$$\\text{Carrier Frequency} = 2\\sqrt{10^{-5}} - 2\\left(\\sqrt{10^{-5}}\\right)^2 = 2\\sqrt{10^{-5}} - 2(10^{-5})$$\n\nTo obtain the numerical value, we first compute $q$:\n$$q = \\sqrt{10^{-5}} = \\sqrt{0.00001} \\approx 0.00316227766$$\nThen, we compute $p$:\n$$p = 1 - q \\approx 1 - 0.00316227766 = 0.99683772234$$\nNow we compute the carrier frequency, $2pq$:\n$$\\text{Carrier Frequency} = 2pq \\approx 2 \\times (0.99683772234) \\times (0.00316227766)$$\n$$\\text{Carrier Frequency} \\approx 0.00630459428$$\nThe problem requires the final answer to be rounded to four significant figures. The first significant digit is the $6$ in the thousandths place. The first four significant digits are $6$, $3$, $0$, and $4$. The fifth significant digit is $5$, which means we round the fourth digit ($4$) up to $5$.\n\nThus, the rounded numerical value for the carrier frequency is $0.006305$.\nIt is worth noting that for a rare allele where $q \\ll 1$, the carrier frequency $2pq = 2(1-q)q$ is often approximated as $2q$. In this case, $2q \\approx 2 \\times 0.00316227766 \\approx 0.00632455$, which rounds to $0.006325$. While close, this approximation ignores the term $-2q^2$, and the problem's request for a derivation from first principles implies the use of the full, exact expression $2pq$. The calculated value $0.006305$ is derived from the exact formula.",

            "solution": "The problem is evaluated as valid, as it is scientifically grounded in established principles of medical genetics and probability theory, is well-posed with all necessary data provided, and is stated in objective, formal language. We may proceed with a solution.\n\nFirst, we establish the prior probabilities for the possible genotypes and sexes of the fetus. The mother is a heterozygous carrier for an X-linked recessive condition, so her genotype is denoted as $X_D X_N$, where $X_D$ represents the X chromosome with the pathogenic steroid sulfatase (*STS*) gene deletion and $X_N$ represents the X chromosome with the normal allele. The father is unaffected, so his genotype is $X_N Y$.\n\nAccording to Mendelian segregation:\n- A male offspring ($XY$) receives the Y chromosome from the father and one of the mother's X chromosomes with equal probability. Thus, there is a $\\frac{1}{2}$ probability of inheriting $X_D$ (resulting in genotype $X_D Y$) and a $\\frac{1}{2}$ probability of inheriting $X_N$ (resulting in genotype $X_N Y$).\n- A female offspring ($XX$) receives the father's $X_N$ chromosome and one of the mother's X chromosomes with equal probability. Thus, there is a $\\frac{1}{2}$ probability of inheriting $X_D$ (resulting in a carrier genotype $X_D X_N$) and a $\\frac{1}{2}$ probability of inheriting $X_N$ (resulting in a non-carrier genotype $X_N X_N$).\n\nLet $M$ be the event that the fetus is male, and $F$ be the event the fetus is female. We are given $P(M) = P(F) = \\frac{1}{2}$.\nLet $D$ be the event that the fetus carries the *STS* deletion, and $N$ be the event the fetus does not carry the deletion ($N=D^c$).\n\nThe four possible, mutually exclusive outcomes for the fetus have the following prior probabilities:\n1.  Fetus is male and carries the deletion (affected): $P(M \\cap D) = P(D|M)P(M) = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{1}{4}$.\n2.  Fetus is male and does not carry the deletion (unaffected): $P(M \\cap N) = P(N|M)P(M) = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{1}{4}$.\n3.  Fetus is female and carries the deletion (unaffected carrier): $P(F \\cap D) = P(D|F)P(F) = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{1}{4}$.\n4.  Fetus is female and does not carry the deletion (unaffected non-carrier): $P(F \\cap N) = P(N|F)P(F) = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{1}{4}$.\n\nThe sum of these probabilities is $\\frac{1}{4} + \\frac{1}{4} + \\frac{1}{4} + \\frac{1}{4} = 1$, as expected.\n\nThe first part of the problem asks for the recurrence risk among sons. This is the probability that a son is affected, which is the conditional probability $P(D|M)$.\n$$P(D|M) = \\frac{P(M \\cap D)}{P(M)} = \\frac{1/4}{1/2} = \\frac{1}{2}$$\nSo, the recurrence risk among sons is $50\\%$.\n\nThe second part of the problem requires calculating the posterior probability that the fetus is truly affected (male with the deletion, event $M \\cap D$) given two sequential test results: the sex assay reports \"male\" (event $T_M$), and the subsequent CVS assay reports \"deletion detected\" (event $T_D$). We want to find $P(M \\cap D | T_M \\cap T_D)$.\n\nWe use Bayes' theorem:\n$$P(M \\cap D | T_M \\cap T_D) = \\frac{P(T_M \\cap T_D | M \\cap D) P(M \\cap D)}{P(T_M \\cap T_D)}$$\n\nLet's define the test characteristics from the problem statement:\n- Sensitivity of sex test: $s_{\\text{sex}} = P(T_M | M) = 0.99$\n- Specificity of sex test: $\\text{sp}_{\\text{sex}} = P(\\text{not } T_M | F) = 0.99$, which implies $P(T_M | F) = 1 - \\text{sp}_{\\text{sex}} = 0.01$.\n- Sensitivity of deletion test: $s_{\\text{del}} = P(T_D | D) = 0.995$\n- Specificity of deletion test: $\\text{sp}_{\\text{del}} = P(\\text{not } T_D | N) = 0.999$, which implies $P(T_D | N) = 1 - \\text{sp}_{\\text{del}} = 0.001$.\n\nNow, we evaluate the terms in Bayes' theorem.\n\nThe term in the numerator is $P(T_M \\cap T_D | M \\cap D) P(M \\cap D)$.\nGiven the true state of the fetus ($M \\cap D$), the outcomes of the sex test and the deletion test are conditionally independent. The sex test result depends only on the true sex ($M$), and the deletion test result depends only on the true deletion status ($D$).\n$$P(T_M \\cap T_D | M \\cap D) = P(T_M | M \\cap D) P(T_D | M \\cap D) = P(T_M|M) P(T_D|D) = s_{\\text{sex}} s_{\\text{del}}$$\nThe prior probability $P(M \\cap D) = \\frac{1}{4}$.\nSo, the numerator is $s_{\\text{sex}} s_{\\text{del}} \\frac{1}{4}$.\n\nThe denominator is the total probability of observing the test results $T_M \\cap T_D$, which we calculate using the law of total probability by summing over all four possible true states of the fetus ($S \\in \\{M \\cap D, M \\cap N, F \\cap D, F \\cap N\\}$):\n$$P(T_M \\cap T_D) = \\sum_{S} P(T_M \\cap T_D | S) P(S)$$\n- For $S = M \\cap D$: $P(T_M \\cap T_D | M \\cap D) P(M \\cap D) = P(T_M|M)P(T_D|D)P(M \\cap D) = s_{\\text{sex}} s_{\\text{del}} \\frac{1}{4}$\n- For $S = M \\cap N$: $P(T_M \\cap T_D | M \\cap N) P(M \\cap N) = P(T_M|M)P(T_D|N)P(M \\cap N) = s_{\\text{sex}} (1-\\text{sp}_{\\text{del}}) \\frac{1}{4}$\n- For $S = F \\cap D$: $P(T_M \\cap T_D | F \\cap D) P(F \\cap D) = P(T_M|F)P(T_D|D)P(F \\cap D) = (1-\\text{sp}_{\\text{sex}}) s_{\\text{del}} \\frac{1}{4}$\n- For $S = F \\cap N$: $P(T_M \\cap T_D | F \\cap N) P(F \\cap N) = P(T_M|F)P(T_D|N)P(F \\cap N) = (1-\\text{sp}_{\\text{sex}}) (1-\\text{sp}_{\\text{del}}) \\frac{1}{4}$\n\nSumming these terms gives the denominator:\n$$P(T_M \\cap T_D) = \\frac{1}{4} [s_{\\text{sex}}s_{\\text{del}} + s_{\\text{sex}}(1-\\text{sp}_{\\text{del}}) + (1-\\text{sp}_{\\text{sex}})s_{\\text{del}} + (1-\\text{sp}_{\\text{sex}})(1-\\text{sp}_{\\text{del}})]$$\n\nNow we form the final expression for the posterior probability. The factor of $\\frac{1}{4}$ cancels from the numerator and denominator:\n$$P(M \\cap D | T_M \\cap T_D) = \\frac{s_{\\text{sex}}s_{\\text{del}}}{s_{\\text{sex}}s_{\\text{del}} + s_{\\text{sex}}(1-\\text{sp}_{\\text{del}}) + (1-\\text{sp}_{\\text{sex}})s_{\\text{del}} + (1-\\text{sp}_{\\text{sex}})(1-\\text{sp}_{\\text{del}})}$$\n\nSubstituting the numerical values:\n$s_{\\text{sex}} = 0.99$\n$\\text{sp}_{\\text{sex}} = 0.99 \\implies 1-\\text{sp}_{\\text{sex}} = 0.01$\n$s_{\\text{del}} = 0.995$\n$\\text{sp}_{\\text{del}} = 0.999 \\implies 1-\\text{sp}_{\\text{del}} = 0.001$\n\nNumerator:\n$$s_{\\text{sex}}s_{\\text{del}} = 0.99 \\times 0.995 = 0.98505$$\n\nDenominator terms:\n1.  $s_{\\text{sex}}s_{\\text{del}} = 0.99 \\times 0.995 = 0.98505$\n2.  $s_{\\text{sex}}(1-\\text{sp}_{\\text{del}}) = 0.99 \\times 0.001 = 0.00099$\n3.  $(1-\\text{sp}_{\\text{sex}})s_{\\text{del}} = 0.01 \\times 0.995 = 0.00995$\n4.  $(1-\\text{sp}_{\\text{sex}})(1-\\text{sp}_{\\text{del}}) = 0.01 \\times 0.001 = 0.00001$\n\nSum of denominator terms:\n$$0.98505 + 0.00099 + 0.00995 + 0.00001 = 0.996$$\n\nFinally, the posterior probability is:\n$$P(M \\cap D | T_M \\cap T_D) = \\frac{0.98505}{0.996} \\approx 0.989006024...$$\n\nRounding to four significant figures, the result is $0.9890$.",

Dystrophic EB involves defective type VII collagen, and the severity reflects whether the variant causes complete loss of function or exerts a dominant-negative effect on the collagen triple helix.

It is a well-formed question based on sound scientific principles. The solution process can proceed.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe problem requires a step-by-step analysis from the genetic mutation to the clinical phenotype, based on fundamental principles.\n\n1.  **From mRNA to Protein (Translation):**\n    The problem states that an exon of length $117$ nucleotides is skipped from the mature mRNA. The genetic code is a triplet code, where $3$ nucleotides encode $1$ amino acid. Therefore, the number of amino acids removed from the final protein is:\n    $$ \\text{Number of amino acids} = \\frac{\\text{Number of nucleotides}}{3} = \\frac{117}{3} = 39 $$\n    The problem states the reading frame is preserved, which is consistent with the deletion of a number of nucleotides that is an integer multiple of $3$. This deletion results in a protein that is shorter by $39$ amino acids but otherwise has the correct amino acid sequence downstream of the deletion.\n\n2.  **Impact on Protein Structure (Collagen Triple Helix):**\n    Type VII collagen, like other collagens, has a large triple-helical domain characterized by a repeating Gly-X-Y amino acid sequence. The formation of the stable triple helix requires glycine, the smallest amino acid, to be present at every third position to fit into the sterically hindered core of the helix.\n    The deletion removes $39$ amino acids from this domain. We must determine if this deletion disrupts the Gly-X-Y register. The length of the repeating unit is $3$ amino acids. The number of deleted amino acids is $39$. Since $39$ is an integer multiple of $3$ ($39 = 13 \\times 3$), the deletion removes exactly $13$ complete Gly-X-Y triplets.\n    This means that the amino acid sequence before the deletion ends with a Y-position residue, and the sequence immediately after the deletion begins with a Gly-position residue. The crucial Gly-X-Y periodicity is therefore **preserved** across the deletion junction. The resulting $\\alpha$ chain can align with other chains and form a triple helix.\n\n3.  **Impact on Protein Function and Assembly:**\n    Because the Gly-X-Y register is preserved, the shortened $\\alpha$ chains can likely trimerize and fold into a triple-helical molecule. However, this molecule will be shorter than its wild-type counterpart. This shortening will likely impair its ability to assemble into fully functional, stable anchoring fibrils at the dermal-epidermal junction. The protein is therefore not non-functional (null), but rather has reduced or partial function. Such an allele is termed hypomorphic.\n\n4.  **Inferring Clinical Phenotype (Homozygous State):**\n    The individual is homozygous for this variant. This means both *COL7A1* alleles produce the same shortened, partially functional protein. No wild-type protein is produced.\n    -   **Dominant-Negative Effect:** A dominant-negative effect is ruled out. This mechanism typically occurs in heterozygotes, where a mutant protein interferes with the function of the wild-type protein produced from the normal allele (e.g., by incorporating into a trimer and disrupting its structure or function). Since the individual is homozygous, there are no wild-type chains for the mutant protein to \"poison\".\n    -   **Recessive Inheritance:** The disease results from the absence of fully functional protein, which is a recessive mechanism. The clinical phenotype depends on the residual function of the protein.\n    -   **Severity:** Complete loss of type VII collagen function (e.g., in individuals homozygous for null mutations) leads to the most severe form of the disease, known as severe generalized recessive dystrophic EB (RDEB-sev gen), characterized by extensive blistering, scarring, and high morbidity. Since the analysis here predicts the formation of a partially functional protein, one would expect a phenotype that is less severe than RDEB-sev gen. This corresponds to an intermediate or milder form of recessive dystrophic EB.\n\n**Conclusion:** The skipping of a $117$ nucleotide exon results in a $39$ amino acid in-frame deletion. As $39$ is a multiple of $3$, the Gly-X-Y register of the collagen triple helix is maintained. This allows for the production of a shortened but partially functional type VII collagen. In a homozygous individual, this leads to a recessive form of dystrophic EB with a phenotype of intermediate severity, which is less severe than the complete loss-of-function phenotype.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. The in-frame skipping of a 117-nucleotide exon ($39$ amino acids) in the triple-helical domain preserves the Gly-X-Y register, yields a shortened but partially functional type VII collagen, and is most consistent with recessive dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa of intermediate severity rather than severe generalized disease.**\n-   This statement correctly calculates the number of deleted amino acids ($39$).\n-   It correctly deduces that the Gly-X-Y register is preserved because $39$ is a multiple of $3$.\n-   It correctly infers that this leads to a shortened, partially functional protein.\n-   It correctly correlates this molecular finding in a homozygous individual with a recessive, intermediate-severity phenotype, which is less severe than the phenotype associated with complete loss of function.\n-   **Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. The in-frame skipping shifts the Gly-X-Y periodicity and produces a dominant-negative effect on type VII collagen, most consistent with dominant dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa with severe generalized blistering.**\n-   This statement incorrectly claims the Gly-X-Y periodicity is shifted. A deletion of $39$ ($=13 \\times 3$) amino acids preserves the register.\n-   It incorrectly proposes a dominant-negative effect. The individual is homozygous, making a dominant-negative mechanism inapplicable in its classic sense.\n-   It incorrectly concludes a dominant form of DEB. The genetic context (homozygosity for a hypomorphic allele) defines a recessive inheritance pattern.\n-   **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. The skipped exon is within the noncollagenous $1$ (NC1) domain, abolishes binding to laminin $332$, and causes complete loss of anchoring fibrils with a lethal phenotype.**\n-   This statement incorrectly locates the deletion. The problem explicitly states the variant affects an exon \"within the triple-helical domain,\" not the NC1 domain.\n-   The functional consequence described (abolished binding to laminin $332$) is associated with the NC1 domain, not the triple-helical domain.\n-   The prediction of complete loss of function is less likely than partial function, as derived above.\n-   **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. Because the reading frame is preserved, there is minimal biological impact and individuals are asymptomatic due to redundancy in basement membrane proteins.**\n-   This statement grossly underestimates the impact of deleting $39$ residues from the critical structural domain of type VII collagen. While preserving the reading frame is better than a frameshift, a significant deletion in a structural protein is not a 'minimal' impact.\n-   The claim of no symptoms is incorrect; defects in *COL7A1* are known to cause severe skin disease.\n-   The role of type VII collagen in forming anchoring fibrils is unique and essential for robust epidermal adhesion; there is no simple redundancy that would fully compensate for its deficiency.\n-   **Verdict: Incorrect.**",
