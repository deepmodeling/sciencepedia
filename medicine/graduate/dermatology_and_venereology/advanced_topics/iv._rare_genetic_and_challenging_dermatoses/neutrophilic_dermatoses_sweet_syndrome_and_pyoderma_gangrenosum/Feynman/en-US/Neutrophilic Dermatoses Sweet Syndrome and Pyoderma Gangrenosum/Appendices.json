            "solution": "### Step 1: Extract Givens\nThe problem provides the following information about the patient and their condition:\n- **Age:** $52$ years\n- **Underlying Condition:** Myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS)\n- **Clinical Onset:** Abrupt, $4$-day history\n- **Cutaneous Lesions:** Exquisitely tender, edematous, bright erythematous plaques with a pseudovesicular surface and sharply demarcated borders, located on the cheeks, neck, and dorsal hands.\n- **Systemic Symptoms:** Diffuse myalgias, headache, temperature of $38.6^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$.\n- **Recent Medical History:** Received granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) $10$ days prior to presentation.\n- **Laboratory Findings:**\n    - White blood cell (WBC) count: $14.8\\times 10^{9}/\\mathrm{L}$\n    - Neutrophil percentage: $88\\%$\n    - Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR): $78\\,\\mathrm{mm/h}$\n    - C-reactive protein (CRP): $120\\,\\mathrm{mg/L}$\n    - Blood cultures: Negative\n- **Histopathology:** A punch biopsy shows prominent papillary dermal edema and a dense interstitial and perivascular infiltrate of mature neutrophils. Crucially, there is no evidence of true vessel wall necrosis or fibrin deposition (i.e., no leukocytoclastic vasculitis).\n- **Special Stains:** Direct immunofluorescence, bacterial Gram stain, and periodic acid–Schiff (PAS) stain are all negative.\n- **Treatment Response:** Dramatic improvement within $24$ hours of starting oral prednisone at a dose of $1\\,\\mathrm{mg/kg}$, with near-complete resolution by $72$ hours.\n- **Task:** Apply a diagnostic framework requiring two major and two minor criteria to diagnose acute febrile neutrophilic dermatosis (Sweet's syndrome) and identify the option(s) that correctly list fulfilled criteria.\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\nThe problem statement provides a detailed, internally consistent, and clinically realistic case presentation. The described signs, symptoms, laboratory findings, histopathology, and response to treatment are textbook features of Sweet's syndrome, particularly the malignancy-associated and drug-induced subtypes. The diagnostic framework mentioned (two major and at least two minor criteria) corresponds to the well-established and widely used modified diagnostic criteria for Sweet's syndrome. The problem is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. It does not violate any fundamental principles and contains all necessary information to be solved.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. The solution will proceed by applying the established diagnostic criteria to the patient's case and evaluating the given options.\n\n### Derivation of Solution\nThe diagnosis of Sweet's syndrome is established by fulfilling two major criteria and at least two minor criteria. Let us state these criteria and then evaluate the patient's case against them.\n\n**Standard Diagnostic Criteria for Sweet's Syndrome:**\n\n**Major Criteria (both required):**\n1.  Abrupt onset of painful or tender erythematous plaques or nodules.\n2.  Histopathology showing a dense neutrophilic infiltrate without evidence of leukocytoclastic vasculitis.\n\n**Minor Criteria (at least two required):**\n1.  Fever $> 38^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$.\n2.  Association with an underlying hematologic or solid malignancy, an inflammatory disease, or pregnancy, OR preceded by an upper respiratory or gastrointestinal infection or vaccination.\n3.  Excellent response to systemic corticosteroids or potassium iodide.\n4.  Abnormal laboratory values at presentation (at least three of the following four):\n    - ESR $> 20\\,\\mathrm{mm/h}$\n    - Elevated C-reactive protein\n    - Leukocytosis $> 8.0 \\times 10^{9}/\\mathrm{L}$\n    - Neutrophilia $> 70\\%$\n\n**Application to the Patient's Case:**\n\n**Major Criteria:**\n1.  **Abrupt onset of painful plaques:** The patient presented with an \"abruptly appearing, exquisitely tender, edematous, bright erythematous plaques\". This criterion is **MET**.\n2.  **Consistent histopathology:** The biopsy showed a \"dense...infiltrate of mature neutrophils without true vessel wall necrosis or fibrin deposition\". This absence of vasculitis is key and matches the criterion. This criterion is **MET**.\nThe patient satisfies both major criteria.\n\n**Minor Criteria:**\n1.  **Fever:** The patient's temperature is $38.6^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$, which is $> 38^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$. This criterion is **MET**.\n2.  **Association:** The patient has myelodysplastic syndrome (a hematologic malignancy/condition) and received G-CSF (a known drug trigger). This criterion is **MET**.\n3.  **Response to corticosteroids:** The patient had a \"dramatic improvement within $24$ hours of starting oral prednisone\". This criterion is **MET**.\n4.  **Abnormal laboratory values:**\n    - ESR is $78\\,\\mathrm{mm/h}$ ($> 20\\,\\mathrm{mm/h}$).\n    - CRP is $120\\,\\mathrm{mg/L}$ (elevated).\n    - WBC count is $14.8\\times 10^{9}/\\mathrm{L}$ ($> 8.0 \\times 10^{9}/\\mathrm{L}$).\n    - Neutrophil percentage is $88\\%$ ($> 70\\%$).\n    Since all four laboratory abnormalities are present, this criterion is **MET**.\n\nThe patient meets both major criteria and all four minor criteria. The diagnosis of Sweet's syndrome is unequivocally established. The task is to find the options that correctly list two major and two minor criteria present in this case.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. Major criteria: abrupt onset of painful erythematous plaques or nodules; dense neutrophilic infiltrate in the dermis without vasculitis. Minor criteria: fever above $38^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$; abnormal laboratory values (elevated ESR or CRP or neutrophilia).**\n- **Major Criteria:** The two listed major criteria are correct according to the standard framework and were both met by the patient.\n- **Minor Criteria:** The two listed minor criteria (\"fever above $38^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$\" and \"abnormal laboratory values\") are correct according to the standard framework and were both met by the patient.\n- **Verdict:** **Correct**. This option accurately identifies two fulfilled major criteria and two fulfilled minor criteria, establishing the diagnosis.\n\n**B. Major criteria: rapidly progressive painful ulcers with undermined violaceous borders; histology showing neutrophilic abscesses with leukocytoclastic vasculitis. Minor criteria: association with inflammatory bowel disease; pathergy at needle sites.**\n- **Major Criteria:** The listed criteria describe pyoderma gangrenosum, not Sweet's syndrome. The patient had plaques, not ulcers, and the histology explicitly showed an absence of vasculitis.\n- **Minor Criteria:** These are also characteristic of pyoderma gangrenosum.\n- **Verdict:** **Incorrect**. This option describes a different neutrophilic dermatosis.\n\n**C. Major criteria: abrupt onset of painful erythematous plaques or nodules; histology showing leukocytoclastic vasculitis with fibrinoid necrosis. Minor criteria: improvement with systemic antibiotics within $48$ hours; positive tissue culture for pathogenic bacteria.**\n- **Major Criteria:** The first criterion is correct, but the second (histology showing leukocytoclastic vasculitis) is incorrect for Sweet's syndrome and contradicts the patient's biopsy report.\n- **Minor Criteria:** These criteria suggest an infectious process. The patient's cultures were negative, and the response was to corticosteroids, not antibiotics.\n- **Verdict:** **Incorrect**. This option lists incorrect histopathological criteria and minor criteria related to infection, which were ruled out in this case.\n\n**D. Major criteria: abrupt onset of painful erythematous plaques or nodules; dense neutrophilic infiltrate in the dermis without vasculitis. Minor criteria: temporal association with malignancy or drug exposure (myelodysplasia on G-CSF); excellent clinical response to systemic corticosteroids.**\n- **Major Criteria:** The two listed major criteria are correct according to the standard framework and were both met by the patient.\n- **Minor Criteria:** The two listed minor criteria (\"temporal association with malignancy or drug exposure\" and \"excellent clinical response to systemic corticosteroids\") are correct according to the standard framework and were both met by the patient.\n- **Verdict:** **Correct**. This option accurately identifies two fulfilled major criteria and two fulfilled minor criteria, establishing the diagnosis.\n\n**E. Major criteria: fever above $38^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$; peripheral neutrophilia. Minor criteria: abrupt onset of painful erythematous plaques; rapid response to systemic corticosteroids.**\n- **Major Criteria:** The listed criteria (fever, neutrophilia) are actually minor criteria in the established diagnostic framework.\n- **Minor Criteria:** The first listed \"minor\" criterion (abrupt onset of plaques) is actually a major criterion. The categorization is incorrect.\n- **Verdict:** **Incorrect**. This option fundamentally misclassifies the major and minor criteria for Sweet's syndrome.\n\nSince the problem asks to select all options that apply, and both A and D present a valid set of fulfilled criteria to diagnose Sweet's syndrome in this patient, both are correct.",

This practice introduces the Number Needed to Treat (NNT), a powerful metric for quantifying the real-world impact of an intervention. By calculating the NNT for infliximab in pyoderma gangrenosum from trial data, you will translate statistical outcomes into a clinically meaningful measure of treatment efficacy .",
            "id": "4466858",
            "problem": "A central aim in evidence appraisal for neutrophilic dermatoses, such as Sweet's syndrome and pyoderma gangrenosum, is to translate randomized controlled trial outcomes into clinically interpretable measures. Consider pyoderma gangrenosum, a neutrophilic dermatosis with dysregulated innate immune activation, for which tumor necrosis factor-$\\alpha$ (TNF-$\\alpha$) inhibition by infliximab has been investigated. In a randomized controlled trial (RCT) that compared infliximab to placebo, the binary outcome \"clinical response at week $2$\" was observed in a proportion $p_{t} = 0.46$ in the infliximab arm and $p_{c} = 0.06$ in the placebo arm.\n\nStarting strictly from fundamental definitions of binary outcome risk in parallel-group RCTs and the concept of absolute effect size for beneficial outcomes, derive the number needed to treat (NNT) for infliximab to achieve a clinical response at week $2$ compared with placebo. Clearly state the assumptions needed to justify the derivation from these definitions, and then compute the NNT implied by the provided data.\n\nExpress the final NNT as a single exact real number without units. No rounding is required.",
            "solution": "The problem statement is a valid exercise in the application of fundamental principles of clinical epidemiology and biostatistics. It is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. We shall proceed with a formal derivation and calculation.\n\nThe problem requires the derivation and computation of the Number Needed to Treat (NNT), a key metric in evidence-based medicine for evaluating the efficacy of an intervention from a randomized controlled trial (RCT). We begin from the fundamental definitions of risk and absolute effect size.\n\nLet $R_t$ be the risk of the event of interest (in this case, the beneficial outcome \"clinical response at week $2$\") in the treatment group (infliximab arm).\nLet $R_c$ be the risk of the same event in the control group (placebo arm).\nIn an RCT, these risks are estimated by the observed proportions of subjects experiencing the outcome in each group. Let these proportions be $p_t$ and $p_c$, respectively.\nFrom the problem statement, we are given:\n- The proportion of clinical response in the treatment group, $p_t = 0.46$.\n- The proportion of clinical response in the control group, $p_c = 0.06$.\n\nThus, we have the estimated risks:\n$R_t = p_t = 0.46$\n$R_c = p_c = 0.06$\n\nThe problem specifies that the outcome is beneficial. Therefore, the absolute effect size is the increase in the probability of achieving this beneficial outcome due to the treatment. This is defined as the Absolute Risk Increase (ARI) or, more aptly for a positive outcome, the Absolute Benefit Increase (ABI). It is the difference between the risk in the treatment group and the risk in the control group.\n\n$$ABI = R_t - R_c$$\n\nSubstituting the given proportions:\n$$ABI = p_t - p_c$$\n\nThe Number Needed to Treat (NNT) is defined as the average number of patients who must be treated with the experimental therapy to achieve one additional beneficial outcome that would not have occurred had the patients received the control therapy. It is the mathematical reciprocal of the absolute benefit increase. The logic is as follows: if each treated patient gains an extra probability of $ABI$ of achieving a good outcome, then the number of patients, $N$, that must be treated to observe one expected additional good outcome is given by the equation:\n\n$$N \\times ABI = 1$$\n\nSolving for $N$ gives the formula for NNT:\n\n$$NNT = \\frac{1}{ABI}$$\n\nSubstituting the expression for ABI, we obtain the formula for NNT in terms of the outcome proportions:\n\n$$NNT = \\frac{1}{p_t - p_c}$$\n\nThis derivation rests on several key assumptions inherent in the interpretation of NNT from an RCT:\n1.  **Causality and Lack of Bias**: The RCT design (including randomization, blinding, and use of a placebo) is assumed to be robust, such that the observed difference in outcomes, $p_t - p_c$, is a true causal effect of the intervention and not due to confounding variables or systematic bias.\n2.  **Representativeness**: The patient sample in the RCT is assumed to be representative of the broader patient population to which the NNT will be applied.\n3.  **Homogeneity of Treatment Effect**: The NNT is an average population measure. Its application assumes that the absolute benefit increase, $ABI$, is reasonably constant across the patient population. In reality, patient responses may vary significantly.\n4.  **Independence of Outcomes**: The clinical response of one patient is assumed to be independent of the outcomes of other patients.\n\nWe now proceed with the computation using the data provided in the problem statement.\nGiven:\n$p_t = 0.46$\n$p_c = 0.06$\n\nFirst, we calculate the absolute benefit increase (ABI):\n$$ABI = p_t - p_c = 0.46 - 0.06 = 0.40$$\n\nNext, we calculate the NNT using its derived definition:\n$$NNT = \\frac{1}{ABI} = \\frac{1}{0.40}$$\n\nTo express this as an exact real number, we can convert the decimal to a fraction:\n$$NNT = \\frac{1}{\\frac{40}{100}} = \\frac{100}{40} = \\frac{10}{4} = 2.5$$\n\nThe NNT for infliximab to achieve one additional clinical response at week $2$ compared with placebo is $2.5$. This means that, on average, for every $2.5$ patients with pyoderma gangrenosum treated with infliximab instead of placebo, one additional patient will achieve a clinical response at week $2$.",
