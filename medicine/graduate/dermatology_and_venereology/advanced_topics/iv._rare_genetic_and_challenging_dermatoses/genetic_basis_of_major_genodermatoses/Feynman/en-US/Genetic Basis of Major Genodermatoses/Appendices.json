It applies fundamental principles of statistical mechanics (the Boltzmann distribution and the partition function) to a well-established biophysical context: the stability of a protein dimer (keratin) and the effect of mutations, which is relevant to the genodermatosis epidermolysis bullosa simplex. The use of a two-state model is a standard and valid simplification in biophysics. The problem is well-posed, providing all necessary data ($\\Delta G$, $T$, $R$) and a clear, unambiguous objective. The provided values are physically realistic for a biological system at physiological temperature. The problem is objective and contains no unsubstantiated claims or logical contradictions. It does not violate any of the criteria for invalidity.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. A solution will be provided.\n\nThe problem asks for the fraction of intact keratin dimers at thermodynamic equilibrium. This fraction is equivalent to the probability of finding a single dimerization site in the \"intact\" state. According to the principles of statistical mechanics for a system in a canonical ensemble, the probability $P_i$ of a system occupying a microstate $i$ with energy $G_i$ is given by the Boltzmann distribution:\n$$P_i = \\frac{\\exp(-\\frac{G_i}{RT})}{Z}$$\nwhere $Z$ is the partition function, $R$ is the gas constant, and $T$ is the absolute temperature. The energies $G_i$ are given as molar Gibbs free energies, hence the use of $R$ instead of the Boltzmann constant $k_B$.\n\nThe partition function $Z$ is the sum of the Boltzmann factors over all possible states of the system. For the given two-state system, the states are \"intact\" and \"dissociated\".\n$$Z = \\sum_{i \\in \\{\\mathrm{intact}, \\mathrm{dissociated}\\}} \\exp(-\\frac{G_i}{RT})$$\n\nThe problem specifies the molar Gibbs free energies for the two states:\nThe dissociated state is the reference state, so its energy is $G_{\\mathrm{diss}} = 0$.\nThe intact state has an energy penalty $\\Delta G$, so its energy is $G_{\\mathrm{intact}} = \\Delta G = +2\\ \\mathrm{kcal\\ mol^{-1}}$.\n\nSubstituting these energies into the expression for the partition function:\n$$Z = \\exp(-\\frac{G_{\\mathrm{diss}}}{RT}) + \\exp(-\\frac{G_{\\mathrm{intact}}}{RT}) = \\exp(-\\frac{0}{RT}) + \\exp(-\\frac{\\Delta G}{RT})$$\n$$Z = 1 + \\exp(-\\frac{\\Delta G}{RT})$$\n\nThe equilibrium fraction of intact dimers, $f_{\\mathrm{intact}}$, is the probability of the system being in the \"intact\" state, $P_{\\mathrm{intact}}$.\n$$f_{\\mathrm{intact}} = P_{\\mathrm{intact}} = \\frac{\\exp(-\\frac{G_{\\mathrm{intact}}}{RT})}{Z}$$\nSubstituting the expressions for $G_{\\mathrm{intact}}$ and $Z$:\n$$f_{\\mathrm{intact}} = \\frac{\\exp(-\\frac{\\Delta G}{RT})}{1 + \\exp(-\\frac{\\Delta G}{RT})}$$\nThis is the derived expression for the equilibrium fraction of intact dimers. This function is a form of the sigmoid or logistic function.\n\nNext, we evaluate this expression numerically using the provided values:\n$\\Delta G = 2\\ \\mathrm{kcal\\ mol^{-1}}$\n$T = 310\\ \\mathrm{K}$\n$R = 1.987 \\times 10^{-3}\\ \\mathrm{kcal\\ mol^{-1}\\ K^{-1}}$\n\nFirst, we compute the product $RT$:\n$$RT = (1.987 \\times 10^{-3}\\ \\mathrm{kcal\\ mol^{-1}\\ K^{-1}}) \\times (310\\ \\mathrm{K}) = 0.61597\\ \\mathrm{kcal\\ mol^{-1}}$$\nNow, we compute the dimensionless exponent $\\frac{\\Delta G}{RT}$:\n$$\\frac{\\Delta G}{RT} = \\frac{2\\ \\mathrm{kcal\\ mol^{-1}}}{0.61597\\ \\mathrm{kcal\\ mol^{-1}}} \\approx 3.246911$$\nWe substitute this value back into the expression for $f_{\\mathrm{intact}}$:\n$$f_{\\mathrm{intact}} = \\frac{\\exp(-3.246911)}{1 + \\exp(-3.246911)}$$\nAlternatively, to avoid calculating small exponential numbers, we can rewrite the fraction as:\n$$f_{\\mathrm{intact}} = \\frac{1}{\\exp(\\frac{\\Delta G}{RT}) + 1}$$\n$$f_{\\mathrm{intact}} = \\frac{1}{\\exp(3.246911) + 1}$$\nCalculating the value:\n$$\\exp(3.246911) \\approx 25.70992$$\n$$f_{\\mathrm{intact}} \\approx \\frac{1}{25.70992 + 1} = \\frac{1}{26.70992} \\approx 0.03743946$$\nThe problem requires the final answer to be rounded to three significant figures. The first three significant figures are $3$, $7$, and $4$. The following digit is $3$, which is less than $5$, so we round down.\n$$f_{\\mathrm{intact}} \\approx 0.0374$$\nThis result indicates that due to the $+2\\ \\mathrm{kcal\\ mol^{-1}}$ destabilization penalty from the mutation, only about $3.74\\%$ of the keratin dimers are in the intact state at physiological temperature, which is consistent with the described phenotype of fragile intermediate filament networks.",

It presents a standard application of the Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium principle to calculate disease prevalence in a population. All necessary data and assumptions are provided, and there are no internal contradictions, factual errors, or ambiguities. Therefore, the problem is deemed valid and a solution will be provided.\n\nThe problem asks for the expected prevalence of autosomal recessive dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa (DEB) in a population that satisfies the conditions of Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium (HWE). The fundamental principle of HWE describes the relationship between allele frequencies and genotype frequencies in a population that is not evolving with respect to a specific gene locus.\n\nLet $p$ be the frequency of the wild-type allele of the *COL7A1* gene and $q$ be the frequency of the recessive null allele. The problem states that the population is in HWE, and for a locus with two alleles, the frequencies of the three possible genotypes are given by the terms of the binomial expansion $(p+q)^2 = 1$:\n- The frequency of homozygous wild-type individuals is $p^2$.\n- The frequency of heterozygous individuals (carriers) is $2pq$.\n- The frequency of homozygous recessive individuals is $q^2$.\n\nThe sum of these genotype frequencies must equal $1$:\n$$p^2 + 2pq + q^2 = 1$$\n\nThe problem provides the frequency of the *COL7A1* null allele:\n$$q = 0.005$$\n\nIt also provides the frequency of the complementary wild-type allele:\n$$p = 1 - q = 1 - 0.005 = 0.995$$\n\nDEB is described as an autosomal recessive disorder. This means that for an individual to be affected by the disease, they must possess two copies of the null allele, making them homozygous recessive. The problem further specifies that there is \"complete clinical penetrance\" for individuals with this genotype. This implies that every individual who is homozygous for the null allele will exhibit the disease phenotype.\n\nTherefore, the prevalence of DEB in the population is equal to the frequency of the homozygous recessive genotype. According to the Hardy–Weinberg principle, this frequency is $q^2$.\n\nWe can now calculate this value using the given allele frequency $q$:\n$$\\text{Prevalence of DEB} = q^2$$\nSubstituting the value of $q$:\n$$\\text{Prevalence of DEB} = (0.005)^2$$\nThe calculation proceeds as follows:\n$$(0.005)^2 = (5 \\times 10^{-3})^2 = 5^2 \\times (10^{-3})^2 = 25 \\times 10^{-6}$$\nTo express this result in standard scientific notation (where the mantissa is between $1$ and $10$), we adjust the expression:\n$$25 \\times 10^{-6} = 2.5 \\times 10^1 \\times 10^{-6} = 2.5 \\times 10^{-5}$$\nThe problem requires the final result to be rounded to $3$ significant figures. The calculated value $2.5 \\times 10^{-5}$ currently has two significant figures.

The descriptions of X-linked inheritance, X-chromosome inactivation (lyonization), the Central Dogma, and the specific pathophysiology of IKBKG-related genodermatosis (Incontinentia Pigmenti) are factually correct and represent a standard model for explaining the phenotype of female carriers of X-linked dominant, cell-lethal mutations. The concept of skewed lyonization due to post-inactivation selection is a known biological phenomenon.\n*   **Well-Posed**: The problem is clearly structured. It provides all necessary information (the inactivation ratio and the functional consequence for each cell type) to compute a unique, meaningful proportion. The question is unambiguous.\n*   **Objective**: The language is precise and free of subjective or opinion-based claims. All provided information consists of established scientific facts or quantifiable data.\n\nBased on this analysis, the problem does not exhibit any flaws such as scientific unsoundness, incompleteness, contradiction, or ambiguity. It presents a formalizable query based on verifiable scientific principles.\n\n#### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is deemed **valid**. A solution will be derived in accordance with the provided facts.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe subject is a heterozygous female, meaning one of her X chromosomes carries a wild-type IKBKG allele, which we will denote as $X_{WT}$, and the other carries a pathogenic, loss-of-function mutant IKBKG allele, denoted as $X_{MUT}$.\n\nThe process of X-chromosome inactivation (XCI) results in a mosaic of two distinct cell populations within the epidermis. Let us define these populations:\n1.  **Population A**: Keratinocytes that have inactivated the X chromosome carrying the mutant allele, $X_{MUT}$. In these cells, the active chromosome is $X_{WT}$.\n2.  **Population B**: Keratinocytes that have inactivated the X chromosome carrying the wild-type allele, $X_{WT}$. In these cells, the active chromosome is $X_{MUT}$.\n\nThe problem states an observed XCI skew of $90{:}10$ in favor of the activity of the X chromosome bearing the wild-type IKBKG allele. This directly gives the proportions of the two cell populations in the observed tissue.\nLet $P_A$ be the proportion of cells in Population A, and $P_B$ be the proportion of cells in Population B.\nBased on the given skew, the proportion of cells with an active wild-type allele ($X_{WT}$) is $90\\%$, and the proportion of cells with an active mutant allele ($X_{MUT}$) is $10\\%$.\nTherefore:\n$$P_A = \\frac{90}{90+10} = \\frac{90}{100} = 0.90$$\n$$P_B = \\frac{10}{90+10} = \\frac{10}{100} = 0.10$$\n\nThe problem asks for the expected proportion of keratinocytes with functional IKBKG. We must determine the functional status of each population using the provided foundational facts.\n\n*   For Population A (proportion $P_A = 0.90$): The active allele is the wild-type IKBKG allele on chromosome $X_{WT}$. According to the Central Dogma, expression of this functional allele will lead to the production of functional NEMO protein. Thus, these cells possess functional IKBKG.\n\n*   For Population B (proportion $P_B = 0.10$): The active allele is the mutant IKBKG allele on chromosome $X_{MUT}$. The problem states this is a loss-of-function variant. Furthermore, it is explicitly given that \"keratinocytes with an active mutant IKBKG allele... are functionally non-viable with respect to producing IKBKG function.\" This confirms that cells in Population B do not produce functional IKBKG.\n\nThe total proportion of keratinocytes with functional IKBKG, denoted $P_{functional}$, is the sum of the proportions of all populations that are functional. In this case, only Population A is functional.\n$$P_{functional} = P_A = 0.90$$\n\nTherefore, the expected proportion of keratinocytes with functional IKBKG is $0.90$.\n\n### Mechanistic Relation to Blaschko's Lines\n\nThe computed proportion relates to the clinical phenotype through the mechanism of clonal proliferation during embryogenesis.\n1.  **Mosaicism**: The epidermis is a cellular mosaic, composed of two genetically distinct populations arising from random XCI in the early embryo: a major population ($90\\%$) of functionally normal keratinocytes (expressing the wild-type allele) and a minor population ($10\\%$) of functionally deficient keratinocytes (expressing the mutant allele).\n2.  **Clonal Growth**: The decision of which X chromosome to inactivate occurs in each embryonic precursor cell of the epidermis (an ectodermal cell) and is then fixed for all its mitotic descendants. These descendants proliferate and migrate to form the skin.\n3.  **Blaschko's Lines**: The migration of these clonal cell populations during embryogenesis does not occur randomly but follows specific, stereotyped developmental pathways. These pathways are known as the lines of Blaschko.\n4.  **Lesion Formation**: The $10\\%$ of cells that express the mutant IKBKG allele lack the essential NEMO protein, rendering them unable to activate $NF\\text{-}\\kappa B$ signaling. This leads to cellular dysfunction, apoptosis, or failure to develop properly, resulting in the pathological features of the genodermatosis (e.g., inflammation, blistering, or aberrant pigmentation). Since these deficient cells are not scattered individually but are grouped together in clones that have expanded along Blaschko's lines, the skin lesions manifest as linear or whorled patterns that trace these embryonic pathways. The surrounding, non-lesional skin is composed of the $90\\%$ majority population of functionally normal cells. The $90{:}10$ skew itself is a result of negative selection against the deficient cells, but the residual $10\\%$ is sufficient to produce the clinically apparent, Blaschko-linear phenotype. The computed proportion of $0.10$ for the deficient cell population quantifies the fraction of embryonic cell lineages that give rise to the patterned lesions.",
