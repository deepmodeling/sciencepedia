The phenomenon of phytophotodermatitis is well-established. The problem is well-posed, providing all necessary data and definitions for a unique solution. The language is objective and quantitative. The assumptions (e.g., constant irradiance) are stated explicitly as simplifications for a model, which is standard practice in physics problems. The given numerical values are physically plausible for terrestrial sun exposure. The problem is free of scientific flaws, contradictions, and ambiguities.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is deemed valid. A solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution Derivation\nThe solution proceeds by carrying out the three specified tasks in order.\n\n**Task 1: Derive an expression for radiant exposure $H$.**\n\nThe radiant exposure $H$ is defined as the time integral of the irradiance $I(t)$:\n$$H = \\int I(t)\\,dt$$\nThe problem states that the UVA irradiance is constant over the exposure duration. Let this constant irradiance be $I_0$ and the duration of exposure be $t$. We can therefore set up the definite integral from time $0$ to time $t$:\n$$H = \\int_{0}^{t} I_0 \\,d\\tau$$\nwhere $\\tau$ is the variable of integration. Since $I_0$ is a constant, it can be factored out of the integral:\n$$H = I_0 \\int_{0}^{t} d\\tau$$\nThe integral evaluates to the length of the interval:\n$$\\int_{0}^{t} d\\tau = [\\tau]_{0}^{t} = t - 0 = t$$\nSubstituting this result back gives the expression for radiant exposure under constant irradiance:\n$$H = I_0 \\cdot t$$\n\n**Task 2: Compute the numerical value of $H$.**\n\nThe given data are:\n- Constant UVA irradiance, $I_0 = I_{\\mathrm{UVA}} = 20\\,\\mathrm{W\\,m^{-2}}$.\n- Exposure duration, $t = 1.5\\,\\mathrm{h}$.\n\nTo calculate $H$, the units must be consistent. The unit Watt ($\\mathrm{W}$) is equivalent to Joules per second ($\\mathrm{J\\,s^{-1}}$). Therefore, the exposure duration $t$ must be converted from hours to seconds.\n$$t = 1.5\\,\\mathrm{h} \\times \\frac{60\\,\\mathrm{min}}{1\\,\\mathrm{h}} \\times \\frac{60\\,\\mathrm{s}}{1\\,\\mathrm{min}} = 1.5 \\times 3600\\,\\mathrm{s} = 5400\\,\\mathrm{s}$$\nNow, we can compute $H$ using the derived expression:\n$$H = I_0 \\cdot t = (20\\,\\mathrm{J\\,s^{-1}\\,m^{-2}}) \\times (5400\\,\\mathrm{s})$$\n$$H = 108000\\,\\mathrm{J\\,m^{-2}}$$\nThe task requires the result to be expressed in kilojoules per square meter ($\\mathrm{kJ\\,m^{-2}}$). Since $1\\,\\mathrm{kJ} = 1000\\,\\mathrm{J}$:\n$$H = \\frac{108000\\,\\mathrm{J\\,m^{-2}}}{1000\\,\\mathrm{J\\,kJ^{-1}}} = 108\\,\\mathrm{kJ\\,m^{-2}}$$\n\n**Task 3: Compute the dimensionless exposure index $R$.**\n\nThe dimensionless exposure index $R$ is defined as the ratio of the calculated radiant exposure $H$ to the minimum phototoxic dose $\\mathrm{MPD}$:\n$$R = \\frac{H}{\\mathrm{MPD}}$$\nUsing the value of $H$ calculated in Task $2$ and the given value for $\\mathrm{MPD}$:\n- $H = 108\\,\\mathrm{kJ\\,m^{-2}}$\n- $\\mathrm{MPD} = 80\\,\\mathrm{kJ\\,m^{-2}}$\n\nThe calculation for $R$ is:\n$$R = \\frac{108\\,\\mathrm{kJ\\,m^{-2}}}{80\\,\\mathrm{kJ\\,m^{-2}}} = \\frac{108}{80} = 1.35$$\nThe problem specifies that the final answer for $R$ must be rounded to four significant figures. The exact value of $1.35$ has three significant figures. To express this with four significant figures, we append a zero.\n$$R = 1.350$$\nThis value, being greater than $1$, indicates that the calculated UVA exposure exceeds the minimum phototoxic dose threshold, which is consistent with the patient's presentation of phytophotodermatitis.",

You suspect phytophotodermatitis mediated by furocoumarins (psoralens) from lime juice.

Phytophotodermatitis is a phototoxic (non-immunologic) reaction involving the interaction of psoralens and UVA. The dose-response concept is fundamental. The values for solar UVA irradiance, transmittance of different glass types, and the phototoxic dose threshold are physically realistic and consistent with scientific literature.

The question is unambiguous.\n-   **Objective**: The problem is stated in objective, quantitative terms, free from subjective language or bias.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is **valid**. The setup is scientifically sound, self-contained, and allows for a unique quantitative solution.

For approximately constant irradiance $E$, $H \\approx E \\cdot t$.\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\n\nThe problem statement is evaluated against the established criteria:\n\n-   **Scientifically Grounded:** The problem is firmly grounded in established principles of dermatology and photobiology. The clinical presentation described—painful erythema, vesicles, followed by linear, drip-shaped hyperpigmentation, with a burning sensation—is the classic textbook description of phytophotodermatitis. The combination of citrus fruit (limes), known to contain photosensitizing furocoumarins (psoralens), and subsequent UVA exposure is the well-documented etiology. The provided UVA irradiance value is physically realistic for midday sun. The sparing of skin under an opaque object (the wristband) is a pathognomonic sign confirming the essential role of light, a hallmark of photodermatoses. The statement is scientifically sound.\n-   **Well-Posed:** The problem is well-posed. It provides all necessary information (clinical signs, exposure history, physical data) to deduce the mechanism, perform the required calculation, and evaluate the therapeutic interventions. A unique and logical solution can be derived from the givens.\n-   **Objective:** The problem is stated in objective, clinical, and physical terms. It is free of subjective language, speculation, or bias.\n\nThe problem does not exhibit any of the listed flaws (e.g., scientific unsoundness, incompleteness, contradiction, infeasibility, poor structure). It is a valid and well-constructed problem.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\n\nThe problem is **valid**. The solution will now proceed.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe task is to reconstruct the exposure history, compute the UVA radiant exposure, and identify the most appropriate, mechanism-based interventions.\n\n**1. Reconstruction of Pathophysiological Mechanism:**\nThe clinical picture is pathognomonic for **phytophotodermatitis**, a specific type of phototoxic contact dermatitis.\n-   **Photosensitizer:** The patient was \"muddling and squeezing large quantities of fresh limes.\" Limes and other citrus fruits contain furocoumarins (e.g., psoralen, 8-methoxypsoralen, 5-methoxypsoralen), which are potent photosensitizing chemicals. The \"drip-shaped\" and \"linear arcs\" of the lesions are consistent with liquid splashes on the forearm.\n-   **Photon Exposure:** The patient was in \"direct sun from $13{:}00$ to $14{:}30$.\" Furocoumarins have an action spectrum primarily in the UVA range ($320$–$400 \\, \\mathrm{nm}$). When a furocoumarin molecule absorbs a UVA photon, it enters an excited state and can form covalent bonds with pyrimidine bases (thymine, cytosine) in DNA, leading to cell damage and apoptosis. This cellular damage manifests as a cytotoxic (phototoxic) reaction, which clinically resembles an exaggerated sunburn (erythema, pain, blistering). The subsequent hyperpigmentation is due to stimulation of melanocytes during the inflammatory repair process.\n-   **Corroborating Evidence:** The sparing of skin under the \"leather wristband\" is crucial evidence. It demonstrates that the reaction only occurred where both the photosensitizer (lime juice) and the photons (UVA from the sun) were present simultaneously. This definitively rules out diagnoses that do not require light, such as simple irritant or allergic contact dermatitis. The primary symptom of \"stinging or burning\" rather than itch is also characteristic of a phototoxic reaction, as opposed to a photoallergic reaction which is typically pruritic (itchy).\n\n**2. Calculation of UVA Radiant Exposure ($H_{\\mathrm{UVA}}$):**\nThe problem asks to compute the radiant exposure for the continuous sun interval.\n-   **Formula:** $H \\approx E \\cdot t$\n-   **Irradiance ($E$):** The average UVA irradiance is given as $E_{\\mathrm{UVA}} = 3.0 \\, \\mathrm{mW}/\\mathrm{cm}^{2}$. To perform calculations in standard SI units for energy (Joules), we convert milliwatts (mW) to watts (W):\n    $$E_{\\mathrm{UVA}} = 3.0 \\, \\frac{\\mathrm{mW}}{\\mathrm{cm}^2} \\times \\frac{10^{-3} \\, \\mathrm{W}}{1 \\, \\mathrm{mW}} = 3.0 \\times 10^{-3} \\, \\frac{\\mathrm{W}}{\\mathrm{cm}^2}$$\n-   **Time ($t$):** The continuous exposure interval is from $13{:}00$ to $14{:}30$, which is a duration of $1.5$ hours. We must convert this to seconds to be compatible with Watts (Joules/second):\n    $$t = 1.5 \\, \\mathrm{h} \\times \\frac{60 \\, \\mathrm{min}}{1 \\, \\mathrm{h}} \\times \\frac{60 \\, \\mathrm{s}}{1 \\, \\mathrm{min}} = 5400 \\, \\mathrm{s}$$\n-   **Calculation:**\n    $$H_{\\mathrm{UVA}} = E_{\\mathrm{UVA}} \\cdot t = \\left(3.0 \\times 10^{-3} \\, \\frac{\\mathrm{W}}{\\mathrm{cm}^2}\\right) \\times (5400 \\, \\mathrm{s})$$\n    $$H_{\\mathrm{UVA}} = 16.2 \\, \\frac{\\mathrm{W} \\cdot \\mathrm{s}}{\\mathrm{cm}^2} = 16.2 \\, \\frac{\\mathrm{J}}{\\mathrm{cm}^2}$$\nThe calculated UVA radiant exposure on the affected skin was $16.2 \\, \\mathrm{J}/\\mathrm{cm}^{2}$. This is a substantial dose, well above the minimal phototoxic dose (MPD) for topical psoralens, which is typically in the range of $1$–$5 \\, \\mathrm{J}/\\mathrm{cm}^{2}$.\n\n**3. Evaluation of Interventions:**\nBased on the diagnosis of acute phytophotodermatitis:\n-   **Acute Management:** The primary goals are to reduce inflammation and alleviate symptoms. A mid- to high-potency topical corticosteroid is appropriate to control the severe inflammation (evidenced by vesiculation). Cool compresses can provide symptomatic relief for the burning sensation.\n-   **Preventative Measures:**\n    -   Crucially, any residual photosensitizer must be removed from the skin to prevent further reaction upon subsequent light exposure. The patient only rinsed with water; furocoumarins are lipophilic, so washing thoroughly with soap and water is necessary.\n    -   Strict sun avoidance (specifically UVA) is mandatory for at least $48$–$72$ hours, as the psoralens can remain in the epidermis for this duration.\n    -   Patient counseling is essential for future prevention: understand the cause (citrus + sun), wear protective gloves/sleeves, and wash skin promptly with soap after handling such plants outdoors.\n-   **Long-term Management:** The most common sequela is post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation (PIH), which can be pronounced and long-lasting. The primary management for PIH is rigorous, broad-spectrum sun protection to prevent further darkening. Active lightening agents should only be considered after the acute inflammation has fully subsided.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. The pattern indicates liquid splashes of plant-derived photosensitizer, most plausibly lime-derived furocoumarins (psoralens), followed by high UVA exposure. Compute $H_{\\mathrm{UVA}}$ for the continuous sun interval as $H = E \\cdot t = (3.0 \\times 10^{-3} \\, \\mathrm{W}/\\mathrm{cm}^{2}) \\times (5400 \\, \\mathrm{s}) = 16.2 \\, \\mathrm{J}/\\mathrm{cm}^{2}$, consistent with a phototoxic mechanism in the $320$–$400 \\, \\mathrm{nm}$ range. Interventions: immediate thorough soap-and-water decontamination if exposure recurs, strict UVA avoidance for $48$–$72$ hours, mid- to high-potency topical corticosteroid short course for symptomatic plaques, cool compresses, and counseling on citrus handling outdoors (including protective clothing/gloves and prompt washing). Address post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation later with photoprotection and cautious topical lightening only after the acute phase.**\n-   **Analysis:** This option correctly identifies the mechanism (phytophotodermatitis from limes). The calculation of radiant exposure ($16.2 \\, \\mathrm{J}/\\mathrm{cm}^{2}$) is mathematically and physically correct. The statement that this dose is consistent with a phototoxic reaction is also correct. The proposed interventions—soap-and-water decontamination, UVA avoidance, topical corticosteroids, symptomatic care, counseling, and proper management of PIH—are all mechanism-based, standard-of-care, and appropriate.\n-   **Verdict:** **Correct**.\n\n**B. The morphology represents photoallergic dermatitis to oxybenzone in the sunscreen; compute $H_{\\mathrm{UVA}}$ as $H = 3.0 \\, \\mathrm{mW}/\\mathrm{cm}^{2} \\times 1.5 \\, \\mathrm{h} = 4.5 \\, \\mathrm{J}/\\mathrm{cm}^{2}$, which is below phototoxic ranges; interventions: discontinue sunscreen, photopatch testing, oral antihistamines, and systemic corticosteroids; UVA avoidance is not essential.**\n-   **Analysis:** The diagnosis is incorrect; the morphology (drips/splashes) and symptoms (burning  itching) argue against photoallergy to a uniformly applied sunscreen. The calculation is dimensionally inconsistent and numerically incorrect. Multiplying irradiance in $\\mathrm{mW}/\\mathrm{cm}^{2}$ by time in hours gives units of $(\\mathrm{mW} \\cdot \\mathrm{h})/\\mathrm{cm}^{2}$, not $\\mathrm{J}/\\mathrm{cm}^{2}$. The correct numerical value for the dose is $16.2 \\, \\mathrm{J}/\\mathrm{cm}^{2}$, not $4.5 \\, \\mathrm{J}/\\mathrm{cm}^{2}$. The interventions are inappropriate; systemic corticosteroids are likely unnecessary, antihistamines are not targeted at burning pain, and the claim that \"UVA avoidance is not essential\" is dangerously incorrect.\n-   **Verdict:** **Incorrect**.\n\n**C. The morphology represents allergic contact dermatitis to mint, exacerbated by sun; compute $H_{\\mathrm{UVA}}$ using $E = 3.0 \\, \\mathrm{W}/\\mathrm{m}^{2}$ and $t = 5400 \\, \\mathrm{s}$ to obtain $H = 16.2 \\, \\mathrm{mJ}/\\mathrm{cm}^{2}$; interventions: avoid mint, begin high-potency topical steroid and narrowband ultraviolet B therapy to speed resolution.**\n-   **Analysis:** The diagnosis is incorrect; the history points to limes, not mint. The calculation uses an incorrect initial value for irradiance ($3.0 \\, \\mathrm{W}/\\mathrm{m}^{2}$ is $0.3 \\, \\mathrm{mW}/\\mathrm{cm}^{2}$, an order of magnitude different from the given $3.0 \\, \\mathrm{mW}/\\mathrm{cm}^{2}$) and arrives at a numerically incorrect answer with wrong units ($16.2 \\, \\mathrm{mJ}/\\mathrm{cm}^{2} = 0.0162 \\, \\mathrm{J}/\\mathrm{cm}^{2}$). The intervention of narrowband UVB therapy is absolutely contraindicated and would worsen an acute phototoxic reaction.\n-   **Verdict:** **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. The morphology is most consistent with irritant contact dermatitis from dilute bleach; compute $H_{\\mathrm{UVA}} = 0$ because the wristband blocked light, so photons were not relevant; interventions: topical antibiotics for secondary infection risk, no need for light avoidance, and routine emollients.**\n-   **Analysis:** The diagnosis is incorrect; there is no history of bleach exposure. The reasoning about the calculation is fundamentally flawed. While $H_{\\mathrm{UVA}}$ was zero *under* the wristband, it was significantly non-zero on the affected skin. Stating that photons were \"not relevant\" contradicts the clear evidence of light-dependency (i.e., the sparing). The interventions are misguided; antibiotics are not indicated without evidence of infection, and advising \"no need for light avoidance\" is dangerous.\n-   **Verdict:** **Incorrect**.",
