            "problem": "A $32$-year-old woman presents in early spring with intensely pruritic papules and papulovesicles on the extensor forearms and V of the chest, with sparing under the watchband and under her hat brim. The eruption began approximately $24$ hours after a weekend hike with several hours of sun exposure. She reports no new topical products, sunscreens, or fragrances in the last $4$ weeks and has used the same broad-spectrum sunscreen brand for $2$ years. She notes that similar episodes have occurred in prior springs and that the lesions usually resolve spontaneously within about $7$ days without scarring if she avoids further sun exposure. On examination, there is a polymorphic morphology with coexisting erythematous papules, papulovesicles, and small plaques in a photodistributed pattern; there are no systemic symptoms. You are considering polymorphous light eruption (PMLE) versus photoallergic dermatitis.\n\nUse the following evidence-based assumptions to integrate the clinical features quantitatively. Among adults presenting with first-spring photodistributed pruritic eruptions in a general dermatology clinic without systemic symptoms, the pretest (prior) odds of polymorphous light eruption to photoallergic dermatitis are $2:1$. Assume conditional independence of the following features and the indicated approximate likelihood ratios in favor of polymorphous light eruption over photoallergic dermatitis:\n- Absence of a new topical photoallergen within $4$ weeks: likelihood ratio $= 3.0$.\n- Onset approximately $24$ hours after ultraviolet exposure: likelihood ratio $= 1.0$.\n- Polymorphic morphology (coexistence of papules, papulovesicles, and plaques): likelihood ratio $= 2.5$.\n- Spontaneous resolution within $10$ days after sun avoidance: likelihood ratio $= 2.0$.\n\nBased on these data and starting from first principles of probabilistic diagnostic reasoning, which of the following best approximates the posterior probability that the diagnosis is polymorphous light eruption for this patient?\n\nA.

            "solution": "The problem statement is first subjected to validation.\n\n**Step 1: Extract Givens**\n- Patient history: A $32$-year-old woman with a history of recurrent spring-time pruritic eruptions on sun-exposed areas.\n- Current episode: Onset of pruritic papules, papulovesicles, and small plaques on the forearms and chest approximately $24$ hours after sun exposure. There is sparing of skin under a watchband and hat.\n- Relevant negatives: No new topical products, sunscreens, or fragrances in the last $4$ weeks.\n- Resolution: Past episodes resolved spontaneously in about $7$ days with sun avoidance.\n- Differential diagnosis: Polymorphous light eruption (PMLE) versus photoallergic dermatitis.\n- Prior odds (pretest odds) of PMLE to photoallergic dermatitis: $2:1$.\n- Conditional Likelihood Ratios (LR) in favor of PMLE over photoallergic dermatitis:\n    - $LR_1$ (Absence of a new topical photoallergen within $4$ weeks) $= 3.0$.\n    - $LR_2$ (Onset approximately $24$ hours after ultraviolet exposure) $= 1.0$.\n    - $LR_3$ (Polymorphic morphology) $= 2.5$.\n    - $LR_4$ (Spontaneous resolution within $10$ days after sun avoidance) $= 2.0$. The patient's history of resolution in \"about $7$ days\" is consistent with this finding.\n- Assumption: The clinical features are conditionally independent.\n\n**Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens**\nThe problem is a well-structured exercise in Bayesian diagnostic reasoning, a cornerstone of evidence-based medicine.\n- **Scientifically Grounded:** The problem is based on established principles of probability theory (Bayes' theorem) applied to a realistic clinical scenario in dermatology. The differential diagnosis, clinical features, and use of likelihood ratios to quantify the weight of evidence are standard in modern medical diagnostics.\n- **Well-Posed:** The problem provides all necessary quantitative data (prior odds and a complete set of likelihood ratios for the presented findings) and a key assumption (conditional independence) required to compute a unique posterior probability. The question is unambiguous.\n- **Objective:** The problem is stated in objective, clinical language. The quantitative values, though given as approximations, are precise enough for a calculation.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem statement is valid. It is a scientifically sound, well-posed, and objective application of probabilistic reasoning. I will proceed with the derivation of the solution.\n\n**Derivation of Posterior Probability**\nThe solution requires the application of Bayes' theorem in its odds-likelihood form. The formula states that the posterior odds of a hypothesis are equal to the prior odds multiplied by the likelihood ratio of the evidence.\n\n$$ \\text{Posterior Odds} = \\text{Prior Odds} \\times \\text{Likelihood Ratio} $$\n\nLet $H$ be the hypothesis that the patient has polymorphous light eruption (PMLE). The alternative hypothesis, $\\neg H$, is that the patient has photoallergic dermatitis (PAD).\n\nThe prior odds are given as $2:1$ in favor of PMLE.\n$$ \\text{Prior Odds}(H) = \\frac{P(H)}{P(\\neg H)} = \\frac{2}{1} = 2 $$\n\nThe problem provides four pieces of evidence ($E_1, E_2, E_3, E_4$) and their corresponding likelihood ratios ($LR_1, LR_2, LR_3, LR_4$). Since the features are assumed to be conditionally independent, the total likelihood ratio for the combined evidence is the product of the individual likelihood ratios.\n\n$$ LR_{\\text{total}} = LR(E_1, E_2, E_3, E_4|H) = LR(E_1|H) \\times LR(E_2|H) \\times LR(E_3|H) \\times LR(E_4|H) $$\nPlugging in the given values:\n$$ LR_{\\text{total}} = 3.0 \\times 1.0 \\times 2.5 \\times 2.0 $$\n$$ LR_{\\text{total}} = 3.0 \\times 5.0 $$\n$$ LR_{\\text{total}} = 15.0 $$\n\nNow, we calculate the posterior odds of PMLE.\n$$ \\text{Posterior Odds}(H) = \\text{Prior Odds}(H) \\times LR_{\\text{total}} $$\n$$ \\text{Posterior Odds}(H) = 2 \\times 15.0 = 30 $$\nThe posterior odds are $30:1$ in favor of PMLE.\n\nFinally, we convert these posterior odds into a posterior probability. The relationship between probability $P$ and odds $O$ is given by the formula $P = O / (1 + O)$.\n\n$$ P(H | \\text{Evidence}) = \\frac{\\text{Posterior Odds}(H)}{1 + \\text{Posterior Odds}(H)} $$\n$$ P(H | \\text{Evidence}) = \\frac{30}{1 + 30} = \\frac{30}{31} $$\n\nTo express this as a percentage, we perform the division:\n$$ P(H | \\text{Evidence}) \\approx 0.96774... $$\n$$ P(H | \\text{Evidence}) \\approx 96.77\\% $$\nThis value is best approximated as $97\\%$.\n\n**Evaluation of Options**\n\n*   **A. Approximately $97\\%$, strongly favoring polymorphous light eruption over photoallergic dermatitis**\n    Our calculated posterior probability is approximately $96.77\\%$, which rounds to $97\\%$. A probability of this magnitude indicates that the diagnosis of PMLE is very likely, thus \"strongly favoring\" it. This option is consistent with our derivation.\n    **Verdict: Correct**\n\n*   **B. Approximately $75\\%$, moderately favoring polymorphous light eruption over photoallergic dermatitis**\n    A probability of $75\\%$ corresponds to posterior odds of $P/(1-P) = 0.75 / (1-0.75) = 3:1$. Our calculated posterior odds are $30:1$. This option is numerically incorrect.\n    **Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n*   **C. Approximately $50\\%$, equivocal between polymorphous light eruption and photoallergic dermatitis**\n    A probability of $50\\%$ corresponds to posterior odds of $1:1$. This implies that both diagnoses are equally likely, which contradicts our calculated odds of $30:1$.\n    **Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n*   **D. Approximately $20\\%$, favoring photoallergic dermatitis over polymorphous light eruption**\n    A probability of $20\\%$ for PMLE would mean the diagnosis is unlikely, with odds of $0.20 / (1-0.20) = 0.25$, or $1:4$. This is the opposite of our finding, which strongly favors PMLE.\n    **Verdict: Incorrect**",

It uses standard definitions from photobiology and dermatology (SPF, PPD, dose-threshold), presents a clear and solvable structure, and provides realistic, self-consistent numerical values.
