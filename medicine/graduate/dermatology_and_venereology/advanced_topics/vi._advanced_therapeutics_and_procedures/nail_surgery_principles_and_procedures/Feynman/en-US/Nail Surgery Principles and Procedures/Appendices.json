The solution available is lidocaine $1\\%$.\n\nUsing fundamental unit relationships and definitions applicable to dose calculation and solution concentration, determine the maximum safe mass of lidocaine (in $\\mathrm{mg}$) that can be administered to this patient and compute the corresponding maximum volume (in $\\mathrm{mL}$) of lidocaine $1\\%$ that delivers this dose. Round your final values to three significant figures.

            "solution": "The problem statement has been critically evaluated and is determined to be valid. It is scientifically grounded in established principles of pharmacology and dose calculation, is well-posed with sufficient and consistent data, and is expressed in objective, unambiguous language. The values provided for patient weight ($70$ $\\mathrm{kg}$), maximum recommended dose for lidocaine without epinephrine ($4.5$ $\\mathrm{mg/kg}$), and solution concentration ($1\\%$) are standard and realistic for the clinical context described. The problem is therefore solvable.\n\nThe task is to compute two quantities: the maximum safe mass of lidocaine for the patient and the corresponding volume of a $1\\%$ solution.\n\nFirst, we calculate the maximum safe mass of lidocaine, which we will denote as $m_{\\text{max}}$. This is determined by the product of the patient's weight, $W$, and the maximum recommended specific dose, $D_{\\text{spec}}$.\n\nThe given values are:\nPatient weight, $W = 70$ $\\mathrm{kg}$.\nMaximum recommended specific dose, $D_{\\text{spec}} = 4.5$ $\\mathrm{mg/kg}$.\n\nThe formula for the total maximum mass is:\n$$m_{\\text{max}} = W \\times D_{\\text{spec}}$$\nSubstituting the given numerical values into this equation:\n$$m_{\\text{max}} = 70 \\text{ kg} \\times 4.5 \\frac{\\mathrm{mg}}{\\mathrm{kg}} = 315 \\text{ mg}$$\nThe maximum safe mass of lidocaine for this patient is $315$ $\\mathrm{mg}$. This value has three significant figures, satisfying the rounding requirement of the problem.\n\nSecond, we calculate the maximum volume, $V_{\\text{max}}$, of the $1\\%$ lidocaine solution that corresponds to this mass. To do this, we must first establish the concentration of the solution, $C$, in units that are compatible with our mass calculation (i.e., $\\mathrm{mg/mL}$).\n\nBy standard pharmaceutical definition, a $1\\%$ weight/volume (w/v) solution contains $1$ gram of solute per $100$ milliliters of solvent.\n$$C = 1\\% = \\frac{1 \\text{ g}}{100 \\text{ mL}}$$\nTo use this concentration with our mass in milligrams, we must convert grams to milligrams, using the fundamental relationship $1 \\text{ g} = 1000 \\text{ mg}$.\n$$C = \\frac{1 \\text{ g}}{100 \\text{ mL}} \\times \\frac{1000 \\text{ mg}}{1 \\text{ g}} = \\frac{1000 \\text{ mg}}{100 \\text{ mL}} = 10 \\frac{\\mathrm{mg}}{\\mathrm{mL}}$$\nThus, the concentration of the $1\\%$ lidocaine solution is $10$ $\\mathrm{mg/mL}$.\n\nThe volume of a solution, $V$, is related to the mass of the solute, $m$, and the concentration, $C$, by the equation $m = C \\times V$. To find the maximum volume, $V_{\\text{max}}$, we can rearrange this equation:\n$$V_{\\text{max}} = \\frac{m_{\\text{max}}}{C}$$\nSubstituting the previously calculated value for $m_{\\text{max}}$ and the derived value for $C$:\n$$V_{\\text{max}} = \\frac{315 \\text{ mg}}{10 \\frac{\\mathrm{mg}}{\\mathrm{mL}}}$$\n$$V_{\\text{max}} = 31.5 \\text{ mL}$$\nThe maximum volume of $1\\%$ lidocaine solution that can be administered is $31.5$ $\\mathrm{mL}$. This value also has three significant figures, satisfying the rounding requirement.\n\nThe final answer consists of the maximum safe mass ($315$ $\\mathrm{mg}$) and the corresponding maximum volume ($31.5$ $\\mathrm{mL}$).",

Focal pain on percussion at the lateral proximal nail fold.\n-   **Physical Finding:** The keratinous projection is contiguous with the nail plate and is not a separate soft tissue mass.\n-   **Stated First Principles:**\n    1.  The nail matrix is a germinative epithelium that produces the nail plate.\n    2.  The lateral matrix horn extends proximally beneath the proximal nail fold and laterally into the gutter.\n    3.  Partial matricectomy is successful only if the entire intended segment of germinal matrix is eliminated.\n    4.  Chemical ablation efficacy depends on contact time, concentration, and a dry field.\n\n**Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens**\n-   **Scientific Grounding:** The problem is firmly grounded in the principles of nail anatomy, physiology, and surgery. The clinical presentation is a classic and well-documented complication of partial matricectomy known as a nail spicule or regrowth. The provided first principles are accurate statements from nail biology and surgery.\n-   **Well-Posedness:** The problem is well-posed. It provides sufficient clinical data to deduce a specific etiology and formulate a logical management plan. A unique, best answer exists among the clinical possibilities.\n-   **Objectivity:** The language is clinical, objective, and precise, avoiding any subjective or biased phrasing.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem statement is valid. It is scientifically sound, well-posed, and objective. I will proceed with the solution.\n\n**Derivation of Etiology and Management from First Principles**\n\n1.  **Analyze the Pathological Structure:** The patient presents with a \"rigid, narrow keratinous projection\" that is \"contiguous with the nail plate.\" According to the first principle provided, the nail plate is produced by the nail matrix (a germinative epithelium). Therefore, this keratinous projection is, by definition, a malformed segment of nail plate.\n\n2.  **Identify the Source:** The formation of new nail plate necessitates the presence of active nail matrix tissue. The problem states the patient underwent a partial matricectomy, a procedure intended to *destroy* a segment of the nail matrix. The presence of a new nail projection signifies the failure of this procedure.\n\n3.  **Localize the Residual Matrix:** The clinical examination provides precise localizing information. The projection \"tracks proximally under the proximal nail fold,\" and percussion over this specific area (\"the lateral proximal nail fold\") elicits \"focal pain.\" This pinpoints the source of the nail growth to the most proximal and lateral extent of the targeted surgical area. Applying the second principle, this anatomical location corresponds exactly to the \"lateral matrix horn,\" which \"extends proximally beneath the proximal nail fold.\"\n\n4.  **Determine the Cause of Failure:** The patient's initial procedure used chemical ablation. The fourth principle states that the efficacy of chemical ablation depends on contact time, concentration, and a dry field. The lateral matrix horn is anatomically challenging to access as it is tucked beneath the proximal nail fold. Inadequate reflection of the nail fold or insufficient hemostasis (preventing a dry field) would lead to poor contact between the chemical agent and the target tissue. Consequently, a portion of the germinal matrix in the lateral horn could survive. This aligns with the third principle: \"partial matricectomy ceases production of nail plate only if the entire intended segment of germinal matrix is eliminated.\" The etiology is therefore a residual, active segment of the lateral matrix horn due to incomplete ablation.\n\n5.  **Formulate a Definitive Revision Plan:** A definitive revision must succeed where the initial procedure failed.\n    -   **Exposure:** The primary cause of failure was likely inadequate exposure. Therefore, the revision must ensure complete visualization of the entire lateral matrix horn. This is best achieved by creating a surgical flap, i.e., reflecting the proximal nail fold.\n    -   **Ablation:** To guarantee destruction of the residual matrix, a combination of mechanical and chemical methods is superior. First, the residual matrix tissue and the resulting spicule should be mechanically removed (e.g., sharp excision or thorough curettage) down to the underlying periosteum of the distal phalanx. This physically removes the bulk of the germinative cells.\n    -   **Adjuvant Therapy:** Following mechanical removal, the application of a chemical agent (like $88\\%$ phenol) to the meticulously dried surgical bed serves to destroy any remaining microscopic clusters of matrix cells. Applying it in controlled cycles (e.g., $3$ cycles of $30$ seconds) is a standard technique to ensure adequate penetration while minimizing collateral damage.\n    -   **Post-procedural Care:** The area should be irrigated to neutralize or remove the chemical agent, and the surrounding tissues must be protected throughout the procedure.\n\n**Evaluation of Options**\n\n**A. Etiology: residual lateral matrix horn (germinal matrix) segment not fully ablated due to inadequate proximal exposure under the proximal nail fold. Management: revision lateral partial matricectomy with reflection of the proximal nail fold to expose the lateral matrix horn, sharp excision or curettage of the residual horn down to the underlying periosteum at the lateral margin, followed by controlled chemical matricectomy using $88\\%$ phenol applied in $3$ cycles of approximately $30$ seconds to a dry field with meticulous protection of the nail bed; irrigate after application, and splint the lateral fold to prevent iatrogenic spread of the chemical.**\n-   **Analysis:** This option's stated etiology perfectly matches the derivation from first principles. It correctly identifies the residual lateral matrix horn as the source and inadequate exposure as the likely cause of the initial failure. The proposed management plan is a textbook example of a definitive revision for this problem. It addresses the core issue of exposure by reflecting the nail fold, ensures complete removal through combined mechanical and chemical means, and describes the proper technique for chemical application (dry field, timed cycles) as per the stated principles.\n-   **Verdict:** Correct.\n\n**B. Etiology: hypertrophic granulation tissue impinging on the nail edge due to prior soft tissue trauma. Management: perform soft tissue excision of the lateral nail fold (Vandenbos procedure) without addressing the matrix; maintain the existing nail plate and avoid chemical ablation.**\n-   **Analysis:** This etiology is explicitly contradicted by the physical exam findings of \"no exuberant granulation tissue\" and a \"keratinous projection\" that is \"contiguous with the nail plate,\" not a soft tissue mass. The management plan addresses a different problem (hypertrophy of the nail folds) and would fail to eliminate the source of the nail spicule, leading to certain recurrence.\n-   **Verdict:** Incorrect.\n\n**C. Etiology: distal onycholysis caused by dermatophyte infection producing lamellar splitting at the lateral edge. Management: initiate topical antifungal therapy and serial distal nail debridement; avoid further matricectomy to preserve nail growth.**\n-   **Analysis:** This etiology does not account for the key finding of a projection tracking proximally under the proximal nail fold with associated focal pain on percussion over the matrix area. Fungal infections typically cause distal and lateral onycholysis, subungual hyperkeratosis, and discoloration, which are not the primary features described. The management is for onychomycosis and would not be effective for a structural regrowth spicule.\n-   **Verdict:** Incorrect.\n\n**D. Etiology: improper nail cutting leading to a free-edge spicule from the distal plate only. Management: instruct on straight-across trimming and gently file the spicule; no surgical revision of the matrix is necessary.**\n-   **Analysis:** A spicule from the distal plate edge would not cause focal pain on percussion over the proximal matrix area, nor would it be described as \"tracking proximally under the proximal nail fold.\" This etiology is inconsistent with the anatomical origin of the problem as indicated by the physical exam. The management is palliative, not definitive.\n-   **Verdict:** Incorrect.\n\n**E. Etiology: residual nail bed ridge with hyperkeratosis causing a pseudo-spicule. Management: perform nail bed dermabrasion and apply topical keratolytics; avoid intervention under the proximal nail fold to prevent scarring.**\n-   **Analysis:** A hyperkeratotic ridge of the nail bed would be a soft-to-firm collection of keratin debris, not a \"rigid, narrow keratinous projection\" that is \"contiguous with the nail plate.\" Critically, its origin is the nail bed, not the matrix, so it would not cause focal pain on percussion over the proximal matrix horn. The management plan avoids the source of the problem (the residual matrix under the proximal nail fold) and would therefore be ineffective.\n-   **Verdict:** Incorrect.",

            "problem": "A $28$-year-old professional ballet dancer presents with advanced lateral onychocryptosis of the right hallux consistent with stage $III$ disease, with hypertrophic lateral nail fold and exuberant granulation tissue. She has failed conservative care (soaks, cotton packing, topical antiseptics) over $6$ weeks. She has no diabetes mellitus, no peripheral arterial disease, and does not smoke. She must be fully performance-ready in $12$ days for an international tour, will be wearing tight-fitting pointe shoes during rehearsals, and will have minimal capacity for wound care while traveling. She requests a plan that prioritizes rapid functional recovery and shoe wear tolerance, acknowledging willingness to accept a higher risk of recurrence if necessary, with definitive surgery deferred to the off-season.\n\nUsing first principles of the nail unit anatomy and wound healing, as well as well-tested outcome patterns for the listed procedures, compare the expected outcomes of the following options in terms of recurrence risk, time to comfortable shoe wear, wound drainage profile, and complication profile, and select the most appropriate choice for this patient today:\n\nA.

Partial lateral nail avulsion with chemical matrixectomy using phenol (approximately $88\\%$) applied in $3$ cycles of $30$ seconds each.\n\nC. Radical excision of the hypertrophic lateral nail fold (Vandenbos-type procedure) without matrix ablation, healing by secondary intention.\n\nD. Partial lateral nail avulsion with surgical wedge resection of the lateral matrix horn (Winograd-type procedure) with primary closure.\n\nYour selection should be justified by reasoning from: the mechanical conflict model of onychocryptosis (nail edge impingement on lateral fold), the principle that more extensive tissue destruction or open wounds prolong the inflammatory and proliferative phases of healing, and established clinical observations that chemical or surgical matrix ablation reduces recurrence at the cost of increased early drainage or wound morbidity.",
            "solution": "The problem statement is clinically and scientifically valid. It presents a well-defined scenario involving a $28$-year-old female patient with stage $III$ onychocryptosis of the right hallux. The provided information is self-contained and sufficient for a reasoned decision. The patient's history, professional demands (ballet dancer), specific constraints (performance in $12$ days, tight pointe shoes, minimal wound care), and stated preferences (prioritizing rapid recovery over low recurrence risk) are clear and unambiguous. The problem is well-posed, asking for the most appropriate choice among standard surgical options by applying fundamental principles of anatomy, wound healing, and a specified pathophysiological model. There are no scientific inaccuracies, contradictions, or unrealistic premises.\n\nThe core of the problem is to select a procedure that resolves the acute symptoms of onychocryptosis while minimizing wound morbidity to allow for an extremely rapid return to high-impact athletic activity. This requires a careful balancing of conflicting outcomes: speed of recovery versus the likelihood of long-term cure. The patient has explicitly stated her priority is rapid functional recovery, accepting a higher recurrence risk that can be addressed definitively at a later time.\n\nLet us analyze each option based on the provided principles: the mechanical conflict model, the relationship between tissue destruction and healing time, and the trade-off between matrix ablation and wound morbidity.\n\n**A. Simple partial lateral nail avulsion of the offending spicule without matrix ablation.**\n\nThis procedure directly addresses the mechanical conflict by removing the embedded nail spicule, thus decompressing the inflamed lateral nail fold. The extent of tissue injury is minimal, limited to the avulsion of a small nail fragment and debridement of the associated granulation tissue.\n\n*   **Wound Healing and Drainage:** Since the nail matrix is left intact and tissue destruction is minimized, the inflammatory phase of wound healing is expected to be brief. The resulting wound is a narrow channel that will re-epithelialize quickly. Post-procedural drainage is typically serosanguinous, minimal in volume, and resolves within a few days. This profile aligns with the patient's need for minimal wound care.\n*   **Time to Comfortable Shoe Wear:** With rapid resolution of inflammation and pain, and minimal drainage, this option provides the highest probability of the patient tolerating a tight-fitting pointe shoe within the $12$-day timeframe. The primary source of pain—the impinging nail—is removed, and the iatrogenic wound is the smallest possible.\n*   **Recurrence Risk:** This is the major drawback. Without ablation of the lateral matrix horn, the nail will regrow to its original width, making recurrence of onychocryptosis highly probable. However, the patient has explicitly acknowledged and accepted this risk to meet her short-term professional obligations.\n*   **Conclusion:** This option is **Correct**. It is a temporizing measure that perfectly aligns with the patient's unique and urgent priorities: fastest possible functional recovery at the known cost of a high recurrence rate.\n\n**B. Partial lateral nail avulsion with chemical matrixectomy using phenol (approximately $88\\%$) applied in $3$ cycles of $30$ seconds each.**\n\nThis procedure combines nail avulsion with chemical destruction of the nail matrix to prevent regrowth.\n\n*   **Wound Healing and Drainage:** The application of phenol, a powerful caustic agent, induces liquefaction necrosis of the matrix tissue. This creates a chemical burn. The resulting wound undergoes a significantly prolonged inflammatory and proliferative phase. It is characterized by copious, often malodorous, serous or purulent-appearing (sterile) drainage that can persist for $2$ to $4$ weeks or longer as the necrotic tissue sloughs and the area heals. This prolonged drainage and inflammation profile is incompatible with minimal wound care and rapid return to performance.\n*   **Time to Comfortable Shoe Wear:** The persistent inflammation, drainage, and discomfort from the a chemical burn make return to wearing any shoe, let alone a constrictive pointe shoe, highly unlikely within $12$ days.\n*   **Recurrence Risk:** Low, which is the primary advantage of this procedure. However, this does not align with the patient's stated priority.\n*   **Conclusion:** This option is **Incorrect**. The prolonged healing and substantial wound-care requirements are in direct conflict with the patient's critical $12$-day deadline and logistical constraints.\n\n**C. Radical excision of the hypertrophic lateral nail fold (Vandenbos-type procedure) without matrix ablation, healing by secondary intention.**\n\nThis procedure addresses the mechanical conflict by excising the soft tissue component (the hypertrophic nail fold) rather than the nail.\n\n*   **Wound Healing and Drainage:** This technique creates a large, soft-tissue-deficient open wound that must heal by secondary intention. This involves the slow processes of granulation, wound contraction, and re-epithelialization. The total healing time is typically long, ranging from $4$ to $8$ weeks or more. Throughout this period, the wound is open, painful, and requires regular, often daily, dressing changes.\n*   **Time to Comfortable Shoe Wear:** It is impossible for this type of wound to heal sufficiently to tolerate a pointe shoe in $12$ days. Any attempt would be excruciatingly painful and would disrupt the fragile healing tissue.\n*   **Recurrence Risk:** Very low, as the anatomical configuration is permanently altered.\n*   **Conclusion:** This option is **Incorrect**. It is the most morbid of the choices in the short term and has the longest healing time, making it completely unsuitable for this patient's acute needs.\n\n**D. Partial lateral nail avulsion with surgical wedge resection of the lateral matrix horn (Winograd-type procedure) with primary closure.**\n\nThis procedure provides a definitive surgical cure by excising the offending matrix and closing the resultant wound with sutures.\n\n*   **Wound Healing and Drainage:** Healing is by primary intention, which is theoretically faster than secondary intention. However, the procedure involves incisions and sutures in a mobile, high-pressure area. Sutures themselves act as foreign bodies and can incite inflammation. The wound is fragile in the early stages.\n*   **Time to Comfortable Shoe Wear:** Sutures are typically left in place for $10$ to $14$ days. The intense mechanical stress, pressure, and friction from a pointe shoe applied at or before the $12$-day mark would place the sutured wound at extremely high risk of inflammation, pain, and dehiscence (re-opening). The patient would not be \"fully performance-ready\" as the wound would still be mechanically weak and painful under pressure.\n*   **Recurrence Risk:** Low, comparable to phenol matrixectomy.\n*   **Conclusion:** This option is **Incorrect**. While it offers a definitive cure with theoretically clean healing, the mechanical demands of ballet dancing in pointe shoes are incompatible with the healing of a sutured wound on the toe within a $12$-day period. The risk of failure and complication is too high.\n\n**Summary:** The patient requires the least invasive, least morbid procedure that will resolve the acute pain and inflammation, allowing for a return to elite athletic performance in an extremely short timeframe. Only simple partial avulsion (Option A) minimizes tissue trauma and the subsequent healing burden to a degree that makes the $12$-day goal plausible. The other options (B, C, and D) all involve techniques (chemical burn, large open wound, or a sutured surgical wound) that ensure healing will not be sufficiently advanced by the deadline to withstand the rigors of professional ballet. The patient's acceptance of a high recurrence risk in exchange for rapid recovery is the key to this clinical decision. Therefore, simple partial nail avulsion without matrix ablation is the most appropriate choice.",
