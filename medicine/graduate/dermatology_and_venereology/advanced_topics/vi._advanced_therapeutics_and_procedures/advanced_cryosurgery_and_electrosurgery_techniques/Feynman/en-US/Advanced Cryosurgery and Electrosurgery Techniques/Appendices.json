The scenario described is a simplified but standard model for analyzing thermal therapies like cryosurgery. The problem is well-posed; the one-dimensional heat equation on a semi-infinite domain with a specified initial condition and a step-change boundary condition has a unique, stable, and well-known solution. The language is objective and precise, providing clear data and constraints. Although it simplifies the biophysical reality by neglecting latent heat and blood perfusion, these are stated as explicit assumptions, making the problem self-contained and mathematically solvable. The provided data values are physically realistic for biological tissue. No contradictions, ambiguities, or invalid premises are present.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. A detailed solution will be provided.\n\n## SOLUTION\nThe problem describes transient heat conduction into a semi-infinite medium, which is governed by the one-dimensional heat equation:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial t} = \\alpha \\frac{\\partial^2 T}{\\partial x^2}\n$$\nHere, $T(x, t)$ is the temperature at depth $x$ and time $t$, and $\\alpha$ is the thermal diffusivity.\n\nThe initial and boundary conditions are:\n1.  Initial condition: The tissue is at a uniform initial temperature, $T_i$. For $t=0$ and $x>0$, $T(x, 0) = T_i$.\n2.  Surface boundary condition: The surface temperature is held constant. For $t>0$ and $x=0$, $T(0, t) = T_s = -50^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$.\n3.  Far-field boundary condition: The temperature far from the surface remains unaffected. As $x \\to \\infty$, $T(x, t) \\to T_i$.\n\nThis problem can be simplified by introducing a non-dimensional temperature $\\theta$:\n$$\n\\theta(x, t) = \\frac{T(x, t) - T_s}{T_i - T_s}\n$$\nThe problem is transformed into:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial \\theta}{\\partial t} = \\alpha \\frac{\\partial^2 \\theta}{\\partial x^2}\n$$\nwith transformed conditions: $\\theta(x, 0) = 1$, $\\theta(0, t) = 0$, and $\\theta(\\infty, t) = 1$.\n\nThe problem specifies using a similarity solution. We combine the independent variables $x$ and $t$ into a single similarity variable $\\eta$:\n$$\n\\eta = \\frac{x}{2\\sqrt{\\alpha t}}\n$$\nBy applying the chain rule, the partial differential equation in $(\\theta, x, t)$ can be converted into an ordinary differential equation in $(\\theta, \\eta)$:\n$$\n\\frac{d^2\\theta}{d\\eta^2} + 2\\eta \\frac{d\\theta}{d\\eta} = 0\n$$\nThe boundary conditions become: $\\theta(\\eta=0) = 0$ and $\\theta(\\eta\\to\\infty) = 1$.\n\nThe solution to this ordinary differential equation, subject to the transformed boundary conditions, is given in terms of the error function, $\\mathrm{erf}(\\eta)$:\n$$\n\\theta(\\eta) = \\mathrm{erf}(\\eta)\n$$\nwhere the error function is defined as:\n$$\n\\mathrm{erf}(\\eta) = \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{\\pi}} \\int_0^\\eta \\exp(-u^2) du\n$$\nThus, the temperature distribution in the tissue is:\n$$\n\\frac{T(x, t) - T_s}{T_i - T_s} = \\mathrm{erf}\\left(\\frac{x}{2\\sqrt{\\alpha t}}\\right)\n$$\nThe problem asks to estimate the time $t$ for the thermal penetration depth, $\\delta$, to reach $3\\ \\mathrm{mm}$. The criterion given is that $\\delta$ is the distance at which the similarity variable $\\eta$ is \"of order unity\". In physics and engineering, this is standardly interpreted as setting the dimensionless variable to $1$. Therefore, we set $\\eta = 1$ at the penetration depth $x=\\delta$.\n$$\n\\eta = \\frac{\\delta}{2\\sqrt{\\alpha t}} = 1\n$$\nThis criterion implies that the temperature at the penetration depth has reached a value where $\\theta = \\mathrm{erf}(1) \\approx 0.843$, meaning the temperature has experienced approximately $1 - 0.843 = 15.7\\%$ of the total potential change, which is a reasonable definition for the edge of the \"region of substantial cooling\".\n\nFrom this criterion, we can solve for the time $t$:\n$$\n\\delta = 2\\sqrt{\\alpha t}\n$$\nSquaring both sides gives:\n$$\n\\delta^2 = 4\\alpha t\n$$\nRearranging for $t$:\n$$\nt = \\frac{\\delta^2}{4\\alpha}\n$$\nWe are given the values:\n- Penetration depth $\\delta = 3\\ \\mathrm{mm} = 3 \\times 10^{-3}\\ \\mathrm{m}$.\n- Thermal diffusivity $\\alpha = 1.4 \\times 10^{-7}\\ \\mathrm{m}^{2}\\mathrm{/s}$.\n\nSubstituting these values into the equation for $t$:\n$$\nt = \\frac{(3 \\times 10^{-3}\\ \\mathrm{m})^2}{4 \\times (1.4 \\times 10^{-7}\\ \\mathrm{m}^{2}\\mathrm{/s})}\n$$\n$$\nt = \\frac{9 \\times 10^{-6}\\ \\mathrm{m}^2}{5.6 \\times 10^{-7}\\ \\mathrm{m}^{2}\\mathrm{/s}}\n$$\n$$\nt = \\frac{90}{5.6}\\ \\mathrm{s} = \\frac{225}{14}\\ \\mathrm{s}\n$$\n$$\nt \\approx 16.071428... \\ \\mathrm{s}\n$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to three significant figures.\n$$\nt \\approx 16.1\\ \\mathrm{s}\n$$",

Since the power $P$ is constant over the duration $t$, the energy is the product of power and time:\n$$E = P \\times t$$\n\nNext, we express the thermal energy $Q$ absorbed by the tissue. The relationship between absorbed heat, mass $m$, specific heat capacity $c$, and the resulting temperature change $\\Delta T$ is given by the definition of specific heat capacity:\n$$Q = m c \\Delta T$$\n\nThe mass $m$ of the tissue element is not given directly, but it can be calculated from the given volume $V$ and density $\\rho$:\n$$m = \\rho V$$\n\nBefore proceeding, we must ensure all units are consistent within the SI system.

This correctly describes a minimal, principled lumped model: an alternating source with internal impedance $Z_{s}$ feeding series elements $Z_{a}$, $R_{t}$, and $R_{r}$, with $R_{r} \\propto 1/A$ by the contact area dependence. This captures the key effect of pad area on contact resistance. Verdict — Correct.\n\nB. The computation shows that $I$ decreases by approximately $2.8\\%$ when pad area is reduced by a factor of $8$, and the return-pad heating per unit area increases dramatically (about $60$-fold). The statement claims the opposite trends. Verdict — Incorrect.\n\nC.

This matches the statement and reflects greatly increased burn risk. Verdict — Correct.\n\nD. Modern generators in constant-power mode adjust output amplitude (voltage, duty factor, or waveform) rather than primarily shifting RF frequency to maintain power into changing load impedance; the frequency remains near the design value (here $500\\,\\mathrm{kHz}$). Verdict — Incorrect.\n\nE. Since $V$ increases as $V = \\sqrt{P_{\\mathrm{set}} R_{\\mathrm{tot}}}$ when $R_{\\mathrm{tot}}$ increases, displacement current $I_{C} \\approx \\omega C_{p} V$ increases proportionally. With $C_{p} = 10\\,\\mathrm{pF}$, $I_{C}$ rises modestly (on the order of a few percent), which can slightly increase alternate-site burn risk if current concentrates over small areas. Verdict — Correct.\n\nF. Return Electrode Monitoring (REM) systems monitor pad–skin impedance (often using split-pad differential measurements) to assess contact quality, not absolute output current alone; they are specifically designed to detect high $R_{r}$ and alarm or disable output even at low currents. The statement mischaracterizes REM function. Verdict — Incorrect.",
