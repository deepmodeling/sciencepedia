The eruption covers $22\\%$ of the total body surface area and is accompanied by pruritus that the patient reports is interfering with sleep and work. Using the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) framework for maculopapular eruptions, determine the appropriate CTCAE grade based on the two foundational axes of severity classification: extent of involvement measured by body surface area and impact on activities of daily living.

            "solution": "The problem is valid as it is scientifically grounded in established principles of oncology and dermatology, well-posed with sufficient information for a unique solution, and objective in its language. It requires the application of the standardized Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) to a realistic clinical scenario.\n\nThe solution is divided into two parts as requested by the problem statement: determination of the CTCAE grade and an outline of a risk-based monitoring and escalation plan.\n\n**Part 1: Determination of CTCAE Grade**\n\nThe CTCAE framework grades the severity of adverse events based on objective criteria. For maculopapular eruptions, the primary axes of classification are the percentage of total body surface area (BSA) involved and the impact on activities of daily living (ADL). The problem provides the following data for the patient:\n1.  Extent of involvement: The eruption covers $22\\%$ of the total BSA.\n2.  Impact on ADL: The accompanying pruritus is \"interfering with sleep and work.\"\n\nI will reference the definitions from the CTCAE, version $5.0$, for \"Rash maculo-papular\":\n-   **Grade 1:** Macules/papules covering $<10\\%$ BSA with or without symptoms; not interfering with ADL.\n-   **Grade 2:** Macules/papules covering $10\\%$ to $30\\%$ BSA with or without symptoms; limiting instrumental ADL.\n-   **Grade 3:** Macules/papules covering $>30\\%$ BSA with or without associated symptoms; limiting self-care ADL.\n-   **Grade 4:** Life-threatening consequences; signs and symptoms of severe cutaneous adverse reactions (SCARs) such as Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) or toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN); urgent intervention indicated.\n-   **Grade 5:** Death.\n\nAnalysis based on the provided data:\n\n1.  **BSA Involvement:** The patient's rash covers $22\\%$ of the BSA. This value falls squarely within the range defined for a Grade $2$ event, which is $10\\%$ to $30\\%$ BSA. It is greater than the $<10\\%$ threshold for Grade $1$ and less than the $>30\\%$ threshold for Grade $3$.\n\n2.  **Impact on ADL:** The problem states the pruritus is \"interfering with sleep and work.\" The CTCAE distinguishes between *instrumental ADL* (e.g., managing finances, transportation, shopping, work) and *self-care ADL* (e.g., bathing, dressing, eating). Interference with work is a clear example of limiting instrumental ADL. While interference with sleep is a measure of symptom severity, the functional impairment related to work directly maps to the CTCAE definition for a Grade $2$ event (\"limiting instrumental ADL\"). This is distinct from a Grade $3$ event, which is characterized by the limitation of self-care ADL.\n\n**Conclusion on Grading:** Both axes of assessment consistently point to a single grade. The BSA of $22\\%$ aligns with Grade $2$, and the functional impact of limiting instrumental ADL also aligns with Grade $2$. Therefore, the appropriate CTCAE grade for this adverse event is $2$.\n\n**Part 2: Monitoring and Escalation Plan**\n\nGrounded in risk-based monitoring principles, the plan for a Grade $2$ cutaneous adverse event must ensure timely detection of progression while initiating appropriate management. The initial management for a Grade $2$ maculopapular rash typically involves high-potency topical corticosteroids and oral antihistamines. The oncologic therapy (PD-$1$ inhibitor) is usually continued with close monitoring.\n\n**Immediate Monitoring Frequency:**\nFor a new-onset Grade $2$ event, the patient should be monitored closely to assess the trajectory of the rash and symptoms.\n-   **Frequency:** A clinical evaluation should occur at a minimum of once per week. This can be conducted via an in-person visit or telehealth, contingent on the ability to obtain high-quality clinical photographs to accurately assess the rash's extent and morphology.\n\n**Clear, Quantitative Escalation Triggers:**\nEscalation involves either intensification of dermatologic management (e.g., adding a course of systemic corticosteroids) or alteration of the oncologic therapy (i.e., holding the PD-$1$ inhibitor). The following triggers necessitate one or both of these actions:\n\n1.  **Progression in Extent:**\n    -   **Trigger:** The rash expands to cover more than $30\\%$ of the total BSA.\n    -   **Action:** This quantitatively re-classifies the event as a Grade $3$ adverse event. Management must be escalated to include systemic corticosteroids (e.g., prednisone at $0.5 - 1$ mg/kg/day or equivalent), and holding the PD-$1$ inhibitor should be strongly considered until the rash improves to Grade $1$ or baseline.\n\n2.  **Progression in Functional Impact:**\n    -   **Trigger:** The patient reports new or worsening symptoms that result in limitation of self-care ADL (e.g., inability to bathe or dress independently due to pain, pruritus, or skin fragility).\n    -   **Action:** This also re-classifies the event as Grade $3$ severity, independent of the BSA involved. The management escalation is the same as for progression in extent.\n\n3.  **Development of Alarm Signs/Symptoms (SCARs):**\n    -   **Trigger:** The appearance of any of the following features, which are suggestive of a potential severe cutaneous adverse reaction (SCAR) such as SJS, TEN, or Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS):\n        -   Mucosal involvement (e.g., painful erosions or ulcers on lips, oral cavity, conjunctiva, or genitalia).\n        -   Development of vesicles, bullae (blisters), or epidermal detachment (e.g., a positive Nikolsky sign).\n        -   Significant constitutional symptoms such as fever (e.g., temperature $> 38.5^\\circ \\text{C}$), severe malaise, or lymphadenopathy.\n        -   Development of notable cutaneous or facial edema.\n        -   Cutaneous pain that is out of proportion to the visible rash.\n    -   **Action:** These are red flags for a potential Grade $4$ event. This is a medical emergency requiring immediate cessation of the PD-$1$ inhibitor and urgent hospital admission for dermatologic consultation and intensive supportive care.\n\n4.  **Failure to Respond to Initial Management:**\n    -   **Trigger:** Lack of improvement or continued worsening of the rash (extent, pruritus) after $1$ to $2$ weeks of appropriate Grade $2$ therapy (e.g., high-potency topical steroids).\n    -   **Action:** This indicates that the current management is insufficient. Escalation to systemic corticosteroids should be initiated, and a temporary hold of the PD-$1$ inhibitor may be considered, depending on the rate of progression and severity of symptoms.",

The task is to calculate the total RegiSCAR score by systematically applying the provided rules to the patient's clinical and laboratory data.\n\nThe calculation proceeds by evaluating each criterion of the RegiSCAR scoring system individually.\n\n1.  **Fever**: The patient's body temperature is given as $39.1^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$. The scoring criterion is to assign $+1$ point for a temperature $\\geq 38.5^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$.

The event of interest is the development of at least one keratoacanthoma or cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma.\n- $X_i = 1$ if the $i$-th patient develops a tumor.\n- $X_i = 0$ if the $i$-th patient does not develop a tumor.\n\nThe probability of success for a single trial (a patient developing a tumor) is given by the absolute risk under monotherapy, $p_{\\mathrm{V}}$.\n$$ P(X_i = 1) = p_{\\mathrm{V}} = 0.23 $$\nThe total number of patients, $N_{\\mathrm{V}}$, who develop a tumor in the cohort of size $n$ is the sum of these independent and identically distributed Bernoulli random variables:\n$$ N_{\\mathrm{V}} = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} X_i $$\nThis sum follows a binomial distribution, $N_{\\mathrm{V}} \\sim \\text{Binomial}(n, p_{\\mathrm{V}})$.
