            "solution": "The problem requires the calculation of the post-test probability of mucous membrane pemphigoid (MMP) in a patient, given a positive result from a direct immunofluorescence (DIF) test. This is a classic application of Bayes' theorem in the context of medical diagnostics.\n\nFirst, we define the relevant events using standard probabilistic notation:\n-   Let $D$ be the event that the patient has mucous membrane pemphigoid.\n-   Let $D^c$ be the event that the patient does not have mucous membrane pemphigoid.\n-   Let $T^+$ be the event of a positive DIF test result.\n-   Let $T^-$ be the event of a negative DIF test result.\n\nThe problem provides the following information, which we translate into this notation:\n1.  The pretest probability of the disease is given as $P(D) = 0.30$. This represents the clinician's initial assessment of the likelihood of the disease before the test result is known.\n2.  The probability that the patient does not have the disease is the complement of $P(D)$:\n    $$ P(D^c) = 1 - P(D) = 1 - 0.30 = 0.70 $$\n3.  The sensitivity of the test is defined as the probability of a positive test given the presence of the disease. This is given as $0.85$.\n    $$ \\text{Sensitivity} = P(T^+ | D) = 0.85 $$\n4.  The specificity of the test is defined as the probability of a negative test given the absence of the disease. This is given as $0.95$.\n    $$ \\text{Specificity} = P(T^- | D^c) = 0.95 $$\n\nThe objective is to determine the post-test probability of the disease, given the positive test result. This is the conditional probability $P(D | T^+)$.\n\nWe apply Bayes' theorem, which states:\n$$ P(D | T^+) = \\frac{P(T^+ | D) P(D)}{P(T^+)} $$\n\nThe term in the denominator, $P(T^+)$, is the overall probability of a positive test result, regardless of the patient's true disease status. It can be calculated using the law of total probability, which involves summing the probabilities of a positive test over all possible disease states (present or absent):\n$$ P(T^+) = P(T^+ \\text{ and } D) + P(T^+ \\text{ and } D^c) $$\nUsing the definition of conditional probability, $P(A \\text{ and } B) = P(A|B)P(B)$, we can expand this to:\n$$ P(T^+) = P(T^+ | D) P(D) + P(T^+ | D^c) P(D^c) $$\n\nTo evaluate this expression, we need the value of $P(T^+ | D^c)$, which is the probability of a positive test given that the disease is absent. This is also known as the false positive rate. It is the complement of the specificity, $P(T^- | D^c)$, because given the absence of disease, the test can only be positive or negative.\n$$ P(T^+ | D^c) = 1 - P(T^- | D^c) = 1 - 0.95 = 0.05 $$\n\nNow we have all the necessary components to calculate $P(T^+)$:\n-   The probability of a true positive result is $P(T^+ | D) P(D) = (0.85)(0.30) = 0.255$.\n-   The probability of a false positive result is $P(T^+ | D^c) P(D^c) = (0.05)(0.70) = 0.035$.\n\nSumming these gives the total probability of a positive test:\n$$ P(T^+) = 0.255 + 0.035 = 0.290 $$\n\nFinally, we substitute the numerator and the denominator back into Bayes' theorem to find the post-test probability $P(D | T^+)$:\n$$ P(D | T^+) = \\frac{P(T^+ | D) P(D)}{P(T^+)} = \\frac{0.255}{0.290} $$\n\nPerforming the division yields:\n$$ P(D | T^+) \\approx 0.8793103448... $$\n\nThe problem requires the answer to be expressed as a decimal rounded to four significant figures. The first five significant figures are $8$, $7$, $9$, $3$, and $1$. Since the fifth digit ($1$) is less than $5$, we round down by keeping the fourth digit as it is.\nTherefore, the post-test probability is approximately $0.8793$.",

Mucous membrane pemphigoid is an autoimmune subepithelial blistering disorder driven by immunoglobulin G (IgG) autoantibodies targeting hemidesmosomal components of the basement membrane zone, leading to complement activation, inflammatory cell recruitment, and tissue injury. In sight-threatening ocular disease, systemic glucocorticoids are used acutely to suppress inflammation while steroid-sparing agents are initiated for long-term control. Using the fundamental clinical principles of weight-based dosing and response-guided tapering to balance efficacy with Hypothalamic-Pituitary-Adrenal (HPA) axis safety, determine the initial dose and then apply a predefined taper algorithm.\n\nFundamental bases and definitions to use:\n- Weight-based systemic glucocorticoid dosing: an initial daily prednisone dose of $1$ mg/kg/day is used for severe ocular mucous membrane pemphigoid to rapidly suppress inflammation.\n- Operational definition of “disease control” in autoimmune blistering disease: absence of new lesions for $14$ consecutive days with progressive healing of existing lesions.\n- Tapering principles: initiate taper only after disease control, and taper more slowly at lower doses to mitigate HPA axis suppression and relapse risk.\n\nPredefined taper algorithm:\n1. Compute the initial daily dose as $1$ mg/kg/day.\n2. Begin taper only after $2$ consecutive weeks meeting the disease control definition.\n3.

Flare management during taper: if a week shows new lesions, increase the dose in the following week to the last dose that maintained control plus $5$ mg/day, and maintain that increased dose for $2$ consecutive weeks to reconfirm control, then resume taper from the dose that previously maintained control (without the $+5$ mg/day increment).\n\nClinical course over $10$ consecutive weeks (each week is $7$ days) for this $70$ kg patient:\n- Week $1$: new lesions observed.\n- Week $2$: new lesions observed.\n- Week $3$: no new lesions.\n- Week $4$: no new lesions.\n- Week $5$: apply the taper algorithm; no new lesions.\n- Week $6$: no new lesions.\n- Week $7$: no new lesions.\n- Week $8$: new lesions observed (flare during taper).\n- Week $9$: apply flare management per the algorithm; no new lesions.\n- Week $10$: no new lesions.\n\nTasks:\n- Calculate the initial daily prednisone dose using the weight-based principle above.\n- Using the predefined taper algorithm and the week-by-week response, compute the total cumulative prednisone dose administered over the $10$-week period.\nExpress the cumulative dose in grams and round your answer to four significant figures.
