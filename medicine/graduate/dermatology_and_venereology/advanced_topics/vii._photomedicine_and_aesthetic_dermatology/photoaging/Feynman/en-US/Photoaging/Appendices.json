The biologically effective irradiance for a given biological effect, characterized by an action spectrum $S(\\lambda)$, is the integral of the spectral irradiance $I(\\lambda)$ weighted by the action spectrum over the relevant wavelength range.\n\nFor erythema, the erythemally effective irradiance on unprotected skin is given by:\n$$ \\mathcal{E}_{\\text{unprotected}} = \\int I(\\lambda) S_{\\mathrm{er}}(\\lambda) \\, d\\lambda $$\nWhen a sunscreen with spectral transmittance $T(\\lambda)$ is applied, the transmitted irradiance is $I(\\lambda) T(\\lambda)$, and the erythemally effective irradiance on protected skin is:\n$$ \\mathcal{E}_{\\text{protected}} = \\int I(\\lambda) T(\\lambda) S_{\\mathrm{er}}(\\lambda) \\, d\\lambda $$\nThe SPF is defined as the ratio of these two quantities. The problem specifies the integration range for erythema to be from $300\\,\\mathrm{nm}$ to $400\\,\\mathrm{nm}$.\n$$ \\mathrm{SPF} = \\frac{\\mathcal{E}_{\\text{unprotected}}}{\\mathcal{E}_{\\text{protected}}} = \\frac{\\int_{300}^{400} I(\\lambda) S_{\\mathrm{er}}(\\lambda) \\, d\\lambda}{\\int_{300}^{400} I(\\lambda) T(\\lambda) S_{\\mathrm{er}}(\\lambda) \\, d\\lambda} $$\n\nAnalogously, for Persistent Pigment Darkening (PPD), the effective irradiance for this effect on unprotected skin is calculated over the UVA range ($320\\,\\mathrm{nm}$ to $400\\,\\mathrm{nm}$):\n$$ \\mathcal{P}_{\\text{unprotected}} = \\int_{320}^{400} I(\\lambda) S_{\\mathrm{PPD}}(\\lambda) \\, d\\lambda $$\nFor protected skin, the effective irradiance is:\n$$ \\mathcal{P}_{\\text{protected}} = \\int_{320}^{400} I(\\lambda) T(\\lambda) S_{\\mathrm{PPD}}(\\lambda) \\, d\\lambda $$\nThe UVA-PF is the ratio of these PPD-weighted irradiances:\n$$ \\mathrm{UVA-PF} = \\frac{\\mathcal{P}_{\\text{unprotected}}}{\\mathcal{P}_{\\text{protected}}} = \\frac{\\int_{320}^{400} I(\\lambda) S_{\\mathrm{PPD}}(\\lambda) \\, d\\lambda}{\\int_{320}^{400} I(\\lambda) T(\\lambda) S_{\\mathrm{PPD}}(\\lambda) \\, d\\lambda} $$\n\nNext, we approximate these integrals using the trapezoidal rule with the provided discrete data. The formula for the trapezoidal rule over a set of points $(\\lambda_i, f_i)$ is:\n$$ \\int f(\\lambda) \\, d\\lambda \\approx \\sum_{i=1}^{N-1} \\frac{f(\\lambda_i) + f(\\lambda_{i+1})}{2} (\\lambda_{i+1} - \\lambda_i) $$\n\nLet us define the integrands for the erythema calculation:\n$f_{\\mathrm{er,unprot}}(\\lambda) = I(\\lambda) S_{\\mathrm{er}}(\\lambda)$\n$f_{\\mathrm{er,prot}}(\\lambda) = I(\\lambda) T(\\lambda) S_{\\mathrm{er}}(\\lambda) = f_{\\mathrm{er,unprot}}(\\lambda) T(\\lambda)$\n\nThe values of these integrands at the given wavelengths $\\lambda_i \\in \\{300, 305, 310, 315, 320, 330, 340, 360, 380, 400\\}$ are calculated below.\n$f_{\\mathrm{er,unprot}}(300) = 0.05 \\times 0.30 = 0.015$\n$f_{\\mathrm{er,unprot}}(305) = 0.08 \\times 0.15 = 0.012$\n$f_{\\mathrm{er,unprot}}(310) = 0.12 \\times 0.06 = 0.0072$\n$f_{\\mathrm{er,unprot}}(315) = 0.18 \\times 0.02 = 0.0036$\n$f_{\\mathrm{er,unprot}}(320) = 0.25 \\times 0.006 = 0.0015$\n$f_{\\mathrm{er,unprot}}(330) = 0.35 \\times 0.0015 = 0.000525$\n$f_{\\mathrm{er,unprot}}(340) = 0.40 \\times 0.0004 = 0.00016$\n$f_{\\mathrm{er,unprot}}(360) = 0.45 \\times 0.0001 = 0.000045$\n$f_{\\mathrm{er,unprot}}(380) = 0.42 \\times 0.00005 = 0.000021$\n$f_{\\mathrm{er,unprot}}(400) = 0.35 \\times 0.00002 = 0.000007$\n\n$f_{\\mathrm{er,prot}}(300) = 0.015 \\times 0.016 = 0.00024$\n$f_{\\mathrm{er,prot}}(305) = 0.012 \\times 0.024 = 0.000288$\n$f_{\\mathrm{er,prot}}(310) = 0.0072 \\times 0.032 = 0.0002304$\n$f_{\\mathrm{er,prot}}(315) = 0.0036 \\times 0.040 = 0.000144$\n$f_{\\mathrm{er,prot}}(320) = 0.0015 \\times 0.056 = 0.000084$\n$f_{\\mathrm{er,prot}}(330) = 0.000525 \\times 0.10 = 0.0000525$\n$f_{\\mathrm{er,prot}}(340) = 0.00016 \\times 0.11 = 0.0000176$\n$f_{\\mathrm{er,prot}}(360) = 0.000045 \\times 0.12 = 0.0000054$\n$f_{\\mathrm{er,prot}}(380) = 0.000021 \\times 0.13 = 0.00000273$\n$f_{\\mathrm{er,prot}}(400) = 0.000007 \\times 0.14 = 0.00000098$\n\nNow we compute the integrals.
