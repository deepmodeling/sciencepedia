The specified parameters—wavelength ($635\\ \\text{nm}$), energy fluence ($75\\ \\text{J/cm}^2$), and irradiance ($100\\ \\text{mW/cm}^2$)—are standard and clinically relevant values for PDT of actinic keratoses using aminolevulinic acid-induced protoporphyrin IX. The physical concepts are based on fundamental radiometric definitions. The problem is well-posed, as it provides all necessary information to calculate a unique solution. The language is objective and precise. Therefore, the problem is deemed valid.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. We proceed to the solution.\n\nThe solution requires relating the radiometric quantities of energy fluence ($H$) and irradiance ($E$).\n\nBy definition, irradiance ($E$) is the radiant power ($P$) incident per unit area ($A$):\n$$\nE = \\frac{P}{A}\n$$\nThe units of irradiance are power per area (e.g., $\\text{W/m}^2$ or $\\text{mW/cm}^2$).\n\nEnergy fluence ($H$), sometimes called dose in this context, is the total radiant energy ($\\mathcal{E}$) delivered per unit area ($A$):\n$$\nH = \\frac{\\mathcal{E}}{A}\n$$\nThe units of energy fluence are energy per area (e.g., $\\text{J/m}^2$ or $\\text{J/cm}^2$).\n\nPower ($P$) is the rate at which energy ($\\mathcal{E}$) is delivered over time ($t$). For a source that is \"continuous and temporally stable,\" as stated in the problem, the power is constant. Thus, the total energy delivered over an exposure time interval $\\Delta t$ is given by:\n$$\n\\mathcal{E} = P \\times \\Delta t\n$$\nWe can now establish a direct relationship between energy fluence and irradiance. Substituting the expression for energy $\\mathcal{E}$ into the definition of energy fluence $H$:\n$$\nH = \\frac{P \\times \\Delta t}{A}\n$$\nRecognizing that the term $\\frac{P}{A}$ is the definition of irradiance $E$, we can write:\n$$\nH = E \\times \\Delta t\n$$\nThis fundamental equation states that for a constant irradiance, the total energy fluence delivered is the product of the irradiance and the exposure time. The problem asks for the exposure time, $\\Delta t$, which can be found by rearranging the equation:\n$$\n\\Delta t = \\frac{H}{E}\n$$\nWe are given the values:\n-   $H = 75\\ \\text{J/cm}^2$\n-   $E = 100\\ \\text{mW/cm}^2$\n\nBefore performing the calculation, we must ensure the units are consistent. The energy unit in $H$ is Joules ($\\text{J}$), while the power unit in $E$ is milliwatts ($\\text{mW}$). We must convert milliwatts to a unit compatible with Joules. By definition, $1\\ \\text{Watt} = 1\\ \\text{Joule per second}$ ($1\\ \\text{W} = 1\\ \\text{J/s}$). Therefore:\n$$\n1\\ \\text{mW} = 10^{-3}\\ \\text{W} = 10^{-3}\\ \\text{J/s}\n$$\nSo, the irradiance can be expressed as:\n$$\nE = 100\\ \\text{mW/cm}^2 = 100 \\times 10^{-3}\\ \\text{J/s/cm}^2 = 0.1\\ \\text{J/s/cm}^2\n$$\nNow we can compute the exposure time $\\Delta t$ in seconds:\n$$\n\\Delta t = \\frac{75\\ \\text{J/cm}^2}{0.1\\ \\text{J/s/cm}^2} = \\frac{75}{0.1}\\ \\text{s} = 750\\ \\text{s}\n$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be expressed in minutes. There are $60$ seconds in $1$ minute. We convert the time from seconds to minutes:\n$$\n\\Delta t_{\\text{min}} = \\frac{750\\ \\text{s}}{60\\ \\text{s/min}} = \\frac{75}{6}\\ \\text{min} = 12.5\\ \\text{min}\n$$\nThe problem specifies rounding the final answer to three significant figures. The calculated value of $12.5$ minutes already has three significant figures ($1$, $2$, and $5$). Thus, no further rounding is needed.",

            "solution": "The problem asks for the derivation of the oxygen recovery time in a slab of tissue following depletion during Photodynamic Therapy (PDT). The process is modeled by the one-dimensional diffusion equation, also known as Fick's second law.\n\nThe governing partial differential equation (PDE) for the oxygen concentration $C(x,t)$ is:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial C}{\\partial t} = D \\frac{\\partial^{2} C}{\\partial x^{2}} $$\nThe problem is defined on the domain $0 \\leq x \\leq L$ and for time $t \\geq 0$. The initial and boundary conditions are:\n1.  Initial condition: $C(x,0) = 0$ for $0 \\leq x \\leq L$. This represents complete oxygen depletion at the start of the dark interval.\n2.  Boundary condition at $x=0$: $\\frac{\\partial C}{\\partial x}(0,t) = 0$. This is a no-flux (symmetry) condition at the center of the depleted region.\n3.  Boundary condition at $x=L$: $C(L,t) = C_{0}$. This represents a constant oxygen supply from a perfused boundary, maintaining a concentration $C_{0}$.\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous boundary value problem. We solve it by decomposing the solution into a steady-state part $C_{ss}(x)$ and a transient part $C_{tr}(x,t)$:\n$$ C(x,t) = C_{ss}(x) + C_{tr}(x,t) $$\nThe steady-state solution $C_{ss}(x)$ is the long-term equilibrium, where $\\frac{\\partial C}{\\partial t} = 0$. The diffusion equation becomes $D \\frac{d^{2} C_{ss}}{d x^{2}} = 0$, which integrates to $C_{ss}(x) = Ax + B$. Applying the boundary conditions to $C_{ss}(x)$:\n- $\\frac{d C_{ss}}{d x}(0) = A = 0$.\n- $C_{ss}(L) = A \\cdot L + B = C_0$.\nThis gives $A=0$ and $B=C_0$. Thus, the steady-state solution is a uniform concentration:\n$$ C_{ss}(x) = C_0 $$\nThe transient part, $C_{tr}(x,t)$, must satisfy the homogeneous version of the PDE and adjusted boundary conditions. Substituting $C(x,t) = C_0 + C_{tr}(x,t)$ into the original problem gives:\nPDE: $\\frac{\\partial C_{tr}}{\\partial t} = D \\frac{\\partial^{2} C_{tr}}{\\partial x^{2}}$.\nBCs:\n- $\\frac{\\partial C_{tr}}{\\partial x}(0,t) = \\frac{\\partial C}{\\partial x}(0,t) - \\frac{d C_{ss}}{d x}(0) = 0 - 0 = 0$.\n- $C_{tr}(L,t) = C(L,t) - C_{ss}(L) = C_0 - C_0 = 0$.\nIC: $C_{tr}(x,0) = C(x,0) - C_{ss}(x) = 0 - C_0 = -C_0$.\n\nWe solve for $C_{tr}(x,t)$ using the method of separation of variables. Let $C_{tr}(x,t) = X(x)T(t)$. Substituting into the PDE yields:\n$$ \\frac{T'(t)}{D T(t)} = \\frac{X''(x)}{X(x)} = -k^2 $$\nwhere $-k^2$ is the separation constant.

The \"off-time\" or dark interval between light pulses must be long enough for oxygen to diffuse from capillaries back into the treated tissue region. Our calculation shows that an off-time of approximately $5.16\\ \\mathrm{s}$ is needed to restore oxygen levels to $90\\%$ of the baseline at the point of maximum depletion. For neoplasm treatment, where the goal is maximal cytotoxicity, the off-time should be at least this long to ensure each light pulse is maximally effective at producing reactive oxygen species. For photorejuvenation, where the goal is often a more subtle, controlled biological stimulation rather than cell death, a shorter off-time might be a deliberate choice to moderate the photochemical reaction, or a longer one to ensure uniform stimulation. Thus, this characteristic diffusion time $t_{\\alpha}$ provides a quantitative basis for tailoring PDT pulsing parameters to specific clinical objectives.",
