            "introduction": "In clinical practice, diagnosis is rarely a binary event but rather an iterative process of refining probabilities based on accumulating evidence. This exercise demonstrates how to formally update diagnostic certainty for Kaposi's sarcoma by integrating multiple, independent clinical and pathological findings. By applying the principles of Bayesian reasoning, you will see how a pre-test probability can be transformed into a much more confident post-test probability using the power of likelihood ratios. ",

            "problem": "A dermatology and venereology clinic is evaluating a patient with suspected Kaposi's sarcoma. The patient is a person living with Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV), and the clinical context yields a pre-test probability of Kaposi's sarcoma of $0.12$.

You are asked to stage the disease using the AIDS Clinical Trials Group (ACTG) Tumor-Immune-Systemic (TIS) classification and estimate the patient's median survival under a constant hazard model. Use only the following well-established definitions and assumptions.\n\nFoundational definitions for ACTG TIS:\n- Tumor burden ($T$): $T0$ denotes confined disease without tumor-associated edema or ulceration, limited oral involvement ($\\leq 10$ lesions), and no gastrointestinal or other visceral involvement; $T1$ denotes any tumor-associated edema or ulceration, extensive oral disease ($> 10$ lesions), gastrointestinal involvement, or other visceral disease (for example, pulmonary).\n- Immune status ($I$): $I0$ denotes a CD4$^{+}$ T-cell count $\\geq 200$ cells/mm$^3$; $I1$ denotes a CD4$^{+}$ T-cell count $< 200$ cells/mm$^3$.\n- Systemic illness ($S$): $S0$ denotes absence of systemic symptoms and opportunistic infection, preserved performance status; $S1$ denotes presence of systemic symptoms (for example, fever persisting $> 2$ weeks, involuntary weight loss $> 10\\%$, night sweats), opportunistic infections, or poor performance status.\n\nAssumptions for survival modeling:\n- Time-to-event follows an exponential survival model with a constant hazard rate $\\lambda$ (per month).\n- For the reference stratum $T0$, $I0$, $S0$, the baseline hazard is $\\lambda_{0} = 2.9 \\times 10^{-2}$ month$^{-1}$.\n- Hazards are proportional across strata, with multiplicative effects: $T1$ multiplies the hazard by $1.8$, $I1$ multiplies the hazard by $1.6$, and $S1$ multiplies the hazard by $1.5$.\n\nClinical case:\nA $36$-year-old man with untreated HIV presents with numerous violaceous papules and plaques on the left lower extremity, coalescing over the distal third of the leg.

            "solution": "The problem statement has been validated and is deemed valid. It is scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and contains all necessary information to arrive at a unique solution.\n\nThe problem requires a two-part solution: first, staging the patient's Kaposi's sarcoma using the AIDS Clinical Trials Group (ACTG) Tumor-Immune-Systemic (TIS) classification, and second, calculating the patient's estimated median survival time based on a constant hazard model.\n\nPart 1: Staging of Kaposi's Sarcoma (TIS Classification)\n\nThe TIS classification is determined by evaluating the patient's clinical presentation against the provided definitions for Tumor burden ($T$), Immune status ($I$), and Systemic illness ($S$).\n\n1.  Tumor Burden ($T$): The definition for $T1$ includes \"any tumor-associated edema or ulceration\". The clinical case describes \"tumor-associated pitting edema measuring approximately $3$ cm in circumferential increase\". The presence of tumor-associated edema is sufficient to classify the patient as $T1$, regardless of the number of oral lesions (which is $3$, falling under the $T0$ criterion of $\\leq 10$ lesions) or the absence of visceral involvement. Thus, the patient's tumor stage is $T1$.\n\n2.  Immune Status ($I$): The definition for $I1$ is a CD4$^{+}$ T-cell count \"$< 200$ cells/mm$^3$\". The patient's laboratory result is a CD4$^{+}$ T-cell count of $120$ cells/mm$^3$. Since $120 < 200$, the patient's immune status is classified as $I1$.\n\n3.  Systemic Illness ($S$): The definition for $S1$ includes the \"presence of systemic symptoms (for example, fever persisting $> 2$ weeks, involuntary weight loss $> 10\\%$, night sweats), opportunistic infections, or poor performance status\". The patient reports \"intermittent fevers to $38.5^{\\circ}$C over more than $2$ weeks\" and \"unintentional weight loss of $12\\%$\". Furthermore, a history of \"oral candidiasis\" is documented, which is an opportunistic infection. Any of these findings alone would be sufficient for an $S1$ classification. Therefore, the patient's systemic illness stage is $S1$.\n\nCombining these findings, the patient's ACTG stage is $T1I1S1$.\n\nPart 2: Calculation of Median Survival Time\n\nThe problem assumes a time-to-event that follows an exponential survival model, characterized by the survival function $S(t) = \\exp(-\\lambda t)$, where $\\lambda$ is the constant hazard rate and $t$ is time.\n\nFirst, we derive the general expression for the median survival time, $t_m$. The median survival is the time at which the survival probability is $0.5$ (or $\\frac{1}{2}$).\n$$S(t_m) = \\exp(-\\lambda t_m) = \\frac{1}{2}$$\nTo solve for $t_m$, we take the natural logarithm of both sides:\n$$\\ln(\\exp(-\\lambda t_m)) = \\ln\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)$$\n$$-\\lambda t_m = -\\ln(2)$$\n$$t_m = \\frac{\\ln(2)}{\\lambda}$$\nThis is the required expression for the median survival time in terms of the hazard rate $\\lambda$.\n\nNext, we calculate the patient-specific hazard rate, $\\lambda$. The problem specifies a proportional hazards model where the overall hazard is the product of a baseline hazard and multiplicative factors corresponding to the TIS stage.\nThe baseline hazard, for the reference stratum $T0I0S0$, is given as $\\lambda_{0} = 2.9 \\times 10^{-2}$ month$^{-1}$.\nThe multiplicative hazard factors are:\n-   $T1$: factor of $1.8$\n-   $I1$: factor of $1.6$\n-   $S1$: factor of $1.5$\n\nSince the patient's stage is $T1I1S1$, we apply all three multiplicative factors to the baseline hazard $\\lambda_0$:\n$$\\lambda = \\lambda_{0} \\times (\\text{factor for } T1) \\times (\\text{factor for } I1) \\times (\\text{factor for } S1)$$\n$$\\lambda = (2.9 \\times 10^{-2}) \\times 1.8 \\times 1.6 \\times 1.5$$\nFirst, calculate the product of the factors:\n$$1.8 \\times 1.6 \\times 1.5 = 2.88 \\times 1.5 = 4.32$$\nNow, multiply this by the baseline hazard:\n$$\\lambda = (2.9 \\times 10^{-2}) \\times 4.32 = 0.029 \\times 4.32 = 0.12528 \\text{ month}^{-1}$$\n\nFinally, we calculate the patient's median survival time, $t_m$, by substituting this specific value of $\\lambda$ into the derived formula:\n$$t_m = \\frac{\\ln(2)}{\\lambda} = \\frac{\\ln(2)}{0.12528}$$\nUsing the value $\\ln(2) \\approx 0.693147$:\n$$t_m \\approx \\frac{0.693147}{0.12528} \\approx 5.5328 \\text{ months}$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to three significant figures.\n$$t_m \\approx 5.53 \\text{ months}$$",

            "solution": "The problem is valid as it is scientifically grounded in standard oncological pharmacology, is well-posed with sufficient and consistent data, and is stated objectively.\n\nThe problem requires the calculation of a patient's per-cycle chemotherapy dose based on a linear body surface area (BSA) scaling principle.

In this case, our calculated dose is $D = 37\\,\\mathrm{mg}$, which is precisely an integer. Therefore, the condition to consider rounding is not met. The policy dictates that if the premise of the `if` statement is false, the `otherwise` clause is to be followed. The `otherwise` clause states that \"the exact (unrounded) dose must be prepared.\"\n\nConsequently, rounding is not necessary or applicable in this case. The dose to be administered is the exact calculated dose, which is $37\\,\\mathrm{mg}$.\n\nFinally, the problem requires the numerical answer to be rounded to $3$ significant figures. The calculated dose is $37\\,\\mathrm{mg}$. The number $37$ has two significant figures.
