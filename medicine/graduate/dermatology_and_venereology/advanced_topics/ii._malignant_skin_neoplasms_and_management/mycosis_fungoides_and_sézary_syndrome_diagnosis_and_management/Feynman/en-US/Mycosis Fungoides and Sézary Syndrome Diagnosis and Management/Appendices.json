To bring objectivity and reproducibility to this process, a point-based algorithm integrating clinical, histopathologic, immunopathologic, and molecular evidence has been established. This first practice exercise  allows you to apply this crucial diagnostic tool to a classic case presentation, reinforcing the systematic, multi-parameter approach required to confirm early MF.",

A lesional biopsy demonstrates a superficial lymphocytic infiltrate with epidermotropism and cytologic atypia of small to medium lymphocytes; there is no significant spongiosis. Immunophenotyping shows partial loss of the T-cell marker cluster of differentiation 7 (CD7) among lesional T cells, and polymerase chain reaction analysis demonstrates a positive clonal T-cell receptor (TCR) gene rearrangement.

Express your final score as an integer with no units. Then, justify whether the threshold for early MF diagnosis is met using first principles of the algorithm, without invoking any case-specific shortcuts.",
            "solution": "The problem requires the calculation of a diagnostic score for early mycosis fungoides (MF) based on a specific set of clinical, histopathologic, immunopathologic, and molecular findings. This evaluation will be conducted using the algorithm developed and endorsed by the International Society for Cutaneous Lymphomas (ISCL) and the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC). The fundamental principle of this algorithm is the summation of points from four distinct diagnostic categories. A definitive diagnosis of early MF is established if the total score is greater than or equal to a specified threshold.\n\nThe diagnostic algorithm assigns points as follows, based on a global assessment of all features:\n\n**1. Clinical Criteria:** One point ($+1$) is awarded for each of the following features present:\n    *   Persistent and/or progressive patches/plaques.\n    *   Lesions located in non-sun-exposed areas.\n    *   Variation in the size and shape of lesions.\n    *   Presence of poikiloderma.\n\nThe patient's clinical presentation includes:\n    *   \"long-standing erythematous patches,\" which qualifies as persistent patches. This contributes $+1$ point.\n    *   Lesions \"predominantly on the buttocks,\" a non-sun-exposed area. This contributes $+1$ point.\n    *   \"clinical evidence of poikiloderma.\" This contributes $+1$ point.\n    *   Variation in size and shape is not mentioned in the provided data. This contributes $0$ points.\nThe clinical score, $S_{\\text{clinical}}$, is the sum of these points:\n$$S_{\\text{clinical}} = 1 + 1 + 1 + 0 = 3$$\n\n**2. Histopathologic Criteria:** One point ($+1$) is awarded for each of the following features observed in a lesional biopsy demonstrating a superficial lymphoid infiltrate:\n    *   Epidermotropism without significant spongiosis.\n    *   Atypical lymphocytes.\n\nThe patient's histopathologic findings from the lesional biopsy include:\n    *   \"a superficial lymphocytic infiltrate with epidermotropism and ... no significant spongiosis.\" This satisfies the first criterion, contributing $+1$ point.\n    *   \"cytologic atypia of small to medium lymphocytes.\" This satisfies the second criterion, contributing $+1$ point.\nThe histopathologic score, $S_{\\text{histopathologic}}$, is the sum of these points:\n$$S_{\\text{histopathologic}} = 1 + 1 = 2$$\n\n**3. Immunopathologic Criteria:** One point ($+1$) is awarded for specific findings of T-cell aberrancy. The relevant criterion, given the provided information, is:\n    *   Loss of one or more T-cell antigens, such as $\\text{CD}2$, $\\text{CD}3$, $\\text{CD}5$, or $\\text{CD}7$. In the formal algorithm, significant loss of $\\text{CD}7$ (e.g., <10% of T cells staining positive) is a key feature.\n\nThe patient's immunophenotyping shows \"partial loss of the T-cell marker cluster of differentiation 7 (CD7) among lesional T cells.\" This finding represents an aberrant T-cell phenotype and contributes $+1$ point to the score.\nThe immunopathologic score, $S_{\\text{immunopathologic}}$, is therefore:\n$$S_{\\text{immunopathologic}} = 1$$\n\n**4. Molecular Criteria:** One point ($+1$) is awarded for:\n    *   Detection of a clonal T-cell receptor ($\\text{TCR}$) gene rearrangement via methods such as polymerase chain reaction ($\\text{PCR}$) analysis.\n\nThe patient's molecular analysis demonstrated a \"positive clonal T-cell receptor (TCR) gene rearrangement.\" This contributes $+1$ point.\nThe molecular score, $S_{\\text{molecular}}$, is:\n$$S_{\\text{molecular}} = 1$$\n\n**Total Diagnostic Score Calculation:**\nThe total diagnostic score, $S_{\\text{total}}$, is the sum of the scores from all four categories:\n$$S_{\\text{total}} = S_{\\text{clinical}} + S_{\\text{histopathologic}} + S_{\\text{immunopathologic}} + S_{\\text{molecular}}$$\nSubstituting the calculated values:\n$$S_{\\text{total}} = 3 + 2 + 1 + 1 = 7$$\n\n**Justification for Diagnosis based on Algorithm Principles:**\nThe first principle of the ISCL-EORTC algorithm for early MF establishes a diagnostic threshold. A total score of $4$ or greater is required for a definitive diagnosis. The patient's calculated score is $S_{\\text{total}} = 7$. Since this score exceeds the required threshold:\n$$7 \\ge 4$$\nthe criteria for a diagnosis of early mycosis fungoides are unequivocally met. The combination of persistent, poikilodermatous patches in a non-sun-exposed area, coupled with hallmark histopathologic findings of epidermotropism and atypia, and further substantiated by immunophenotypic aberrancy (CD7 loss) and molecular evidence of clonality (TCR gene rearrangement), provides a robust and multi-faceted basis for the diagnosis according to the established algorithm. The final score is an integer value of $7$.",

            "problem": "In the clinical staging and response assessment of cutaneous T-cell lymphomas such as Mycosis fungoides (MF) and Sézary syndrome (SS), the skin tumor burden is quantified using the modified Severity Weighted Assessment Tool (mSWAT). Starting from the following fundamental base: (i) the disease burden on skin can be represented by the proportion of body surface area (BSA) involved by each mutually exclusive lesion morphology; (ii) the contribution to overall severity from disjoint lesion classes should be additive; and (iii) more advanced morphologies should contribute monotonically more per unit BSA than less advanced ones via fixed morphology-specific weights, formalize a general expression for the mSWAT score as a function that maps morphology-specific BSA involvement to a single real number.\n\nThen, apply your formal definition to the following scientifically realistic scenario. A patient has non-overlapping involvement estimated by standardized BSA mapping: patches covering $6\\%$ of the body surface area, plaques covering $10\\%$, and tumors covering $3\\%$. The severity weights are $1$ for patches, $2$ for plaques, and $3$ for tumors. Assume the provided percentages are already aggregated across anatomic regions and that where lesion types could overlap, only the highest-grade morphology is counted toward its category. Compute the patient’s mSWAT score.\n\nExpress the final mSWAT score as a pure number without units. No rounding is required.",
            "solution": "**Part 1: Formalization of the mSWAT Score**\nLet there be a set of $n$ distinct and mutually exclusive lesion morphologies, indexed by the integer $i$, where $i \\in \\{1, 2, \\dots, n\\}$.\n\nBased on Principle (i), for each morphology $i$, we define a variable $P_i$ representing the percentage of the total body surface area (BSA) that it covers. For example, if a morphology covers $6\\%$ of the BSA, then $P_i = 6$.\n\nBased on Principle (iii), for each morphology $i$, we define a constant weight $W_i$. This weight is a dimensionless positive real number that quantifies the severity of that specific lesion type. If morphology $j$ is more advanced than morphology $k$, then $W_j > W_k$. The contribution of a single lesion type to the total score is proportional to both its area and its weight. The contribution for morphology $i$ is thus the product $W_i P_i$.\n\nBased on Principle (ii), the total score, which we denote as $S_{\\text{mSWAT}}$, is the sum of the individual contributions from all disjoint lesion classes. This additivity allows us to construct the total score by summing the weighted-area products over all morphologies.\n\nTherefore, the general expression for the mSWAT score, as a function that maps the set of morphology-specific percentage BSA involvements $\\{P_1, P_2, \\dots, P_n\\}$ to a single real number, is a linear combination:\n$$S_{\\text{mSWAT}} = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} W_i P_i$$\n\nThis expression formally captures all three foundational principles provided in the problem statement.\n\n**Part 2: Application to the Specific Scenario**\nWe are given a scenario with $n=3$ lesion morphologies: patches, plaques, and tumors. We can assign indices as follows:\n- $i=1$: Patches\n- $i=2$: Plaques\n- $i=3$: Tumors\n\nThe problem provides the percentage of BSA involvement for each type:\n- $P_1 = P_{\\text{patch}} = 6$\n- $P_2 = P_{\\text{plaque}} = 10$\n- $P_3 = P_{\\text{tumor}} = 3$\n\nThe problem also provides the corresponding severity weights:\n- $W_1 = W_{\\text{patch}} = 1$\n- $W_2 = W_{\\text{plaque}} = 2$\n- $W_3 = W_{\\text{tumor}} = 3$\n\nThe weights are monotonically increasing with the clinical severity of the lesion type (patch < plaque < tumor), which is consistent with Principle (iii).\n\nUsing the formalized expression for $S_{\\text{mSWAT}}$, we can compute the patient's score:\n$$S_{\\text{mSWAT}} = W_1 P_1 + W_2 P_2 + W_3 P_3$$\nSubstituting the given numerical values:\n$$S_{\\text{mSWAT}} = (1 \\times 6) + (2 \\times 10) + (3 \\times 3)$$\nPerforming the multiplication for each term:\n$$S_{\\text{mSWAT}} = 6 + 20 + 9$$\nFinally, performing the addition:\n$$S_{\\text{mSWAT}} = 35$$\n\nThe patient's mSWAT score is $35$.",

            "solution": "The solution proceeds by determining each component of the TNMB classification, assigning the overall stage, justifying the management approach, and finally computing the requested composite code C.\n\n**T (Tumor) Category Determination**\nThe T category is determined by the extent and type of skin involvement. The ISCL/EORTC criteria are:\n- T1: Patches and/or plaques covering $< 10\\%$ of the body surface area (BSA).\n- T2: Patches and/or plaques covering $\\ge 10\\%$ of the BSA.\n- T3: One or more tumors ($\\ge 1 \\ \\text{cm}$ in diameter).\n- T4: Confluent erythema covering $\\ge 80\\%$ of the BSA (erythroderma).\n\nThe patient has patches and plaques involving $0.12$ of TBSA, which is equivalent to $12\\%$. This finding alone would correspond to a T2 classification. However, the patient also presents with a new tumor on the thigh measuring $1.8 \\ \\text{cm}$ in diameter. The presence of one or more tumors of at least $1 \\ \\text{cm}$ diameter immediately assigns the highest T category that reflects this finding. Therefore, the presence of the tumor supersedes the plaque/patch involvement for staging purposes.\nThe T category is **T3**, corresponding to the numerical code T=3.\n\n**N (Node) Category Determination**\nThe N category is based on the clinical and histopathological status of peripheral lymph nodes. The criteria are:\n- N0: No clinically abnormal lymph nodes.\n- N1: Clinically abnormal nodes; histopathology shows dermatopathic changes only (no lymphoma).\n- N2: Clinically abnormal nodes; histopathology shows partial effacement of architecture by lymphoma.\n- N3: Clinically abnormal nodes; histopathology shows complete effacement of architecture by lymphoma.\n\nThe patient has clinically abnormal bilateral axillary lymphadenopathy, with the largest node measuring $2.4 \\ \\text{cm}$. The excisional biopsy is critical. The pathology report states \"partial architectural effacement with paracortical expansion by... cerebriform lymphocytes... retention of sinusoidal structures\" and is explicitly interpreted as \"early nodal involvement without complete effacement.\" The presence of a clonal T-cell population confirms malignant involvement. This description precisely matches the criteria for N2. It is not N3 because effacement is not complete.\nThe N category is **N2**, corresponding to the numerical code N=2.\n\n**M (Metastasis) Category Determination**\nThe M category describes the presence or absence of visceral organ involvement.\n- M0: No visceral organ involvement.\n- M1: Visceral organ involvement confirmed by pathology.\n\nThe patient's contrast-enhanced CT scan of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis shows \"no hepatosplenomegaly, no visceral masses, and no pathologic extranodal organ involvement.\" This indicates no evidence of visceral disease.\nThe M category is **M0**, corresponding to the numerical code M=0.\n\n**B (Blood) Category Determination**\nThe B category quantifies the level of blood involvement.\n- B0: Absence of significant blood involvement ($\\le 5\\%$ of lymphocytes are Sézary cells and other criteria for B2 are not met).\n- B1: Low blood tumor burden ($>5\\%$ of lymphocytes are Sézary cells but criteria for B2 are not met).\n- B2: High blood tumor burden, defined by an absolute Sézary cell count $\\ge 1000 \\ \\text{cells} \\ \\mu \\text{L}^{-1}$ OR the presence of a T-cell clone in the blood with one of the following: (a) CD4/CD8 ratio $\\ge 10$, (b) expanded population of $CD4^{+}$ cells with abnormal phenotype (e.g., loss of CD7 > 40% or CD26 > 30%).\n\nThe patient's absolute Sézary cell count is $600 \\ \\text{cells} \\ \\mu \\text{L}^{-1}$, which is below the primary threshold of $1000 \\ \\text{cells} \\ \\mu \\text{L}^{-1}$ for B2. We must check the secondary criteria.\nA T-cell clone matching the skin is present in the blood. We check the associated conditions:\n(a) The CD4/CD8 ratio is calculated from the absolute counts: $\\frac{3.0 \\times 10^{9} \\ \\text{L}^{-1}}{0.20 \\times 10^{9} \\ \\text{L}^{-1}} = 15$. Since $15 \\ge 10$, this criterion for B2 is met.\n(b) The patient has a $\\text{CD4}^{+}\\text{CD7}^{-}$ fraction of $0.48$ (or $48\\%$), which is $>40\\%$, and a $\\text{CD4}^{+}\\text{CD26}^{-}$ fraction of $0.54$ (or $54\\%$), which is $>30\\%$. These represent significant phenotypic abnormalities.\nSince the patient has a blood clone and meets at least one of the secondary criteria (in this case, all of them), the B classification is B2.\nThe B category is **B2**, corresponding to the numerical code B=2.\n\n**Overall Stage Grouping**\nThe overall stage group is determined by combining the T, N, M, and B categories according to the ISCL/EORTC staging chart.\nThe patient's final classification is T3 N2 M0 B2.\nThe staging definitions are:\n- Stage IIB: T3, N0/1/2, M0, B0/1.\n- Stage IVA1: Any T, Any N, M0, B2.\nThe patient has B2 blood involvement. The presence of B2 disease (high blood tumor burden) automatically places the patient in at least Stage IVA1, regardless of the T and N categories, provided there is no visceral metastasis (M0).\nThe stage group is **IVA1**.\nThe corresponding numerical code for the group is G=7.\n\n**Management Justification**\nThe patient has Stage IVA1 mycosis fungoides. This is advanced-stage disease characterized by systemic involvement across three compartments: skin (T3), lymph nodes (N2), and blood (B2). The patient has clearly progressed from an earlier patch/plaque disease. Management of early-stage MF (IA, IB) is typically focused on skin-directed therapies. However, for advanced-stage disease with extracutaneous involvement (nodes and blood) and high-burden skin disease (tumors), skin-directed therapies alone are inadequate to control disease and prevent further progression. Therefore, the clinical situation mandates an **escalation of therapy to include a systemic agent**. The presence of T3, N2, and B2 disease are all individual drivers for this decision; their confluence makes the case unequivocal. De-escalation or maintenance of previous (presumably skin-directed) therapy would be inappropriate and medically unsound given the objective evidence of disease progression and dissemination.\n\n**Final Calculation of the Composite Code C**\nThe values for the encoding are:\n- G = 7 (from Stage IVA1)\n- T = 3 (from T3)\n- N = 2 (from N2)\n- M = 0 (from M0)\n- B = 2 (from B2)\n\nThe composite code C is calculated using the given formula:\n$$C = 10000 \\, G + 1000 \\, T + 100 \\, N + 10 \\, M + B$$\n$$C = 10000(7) + 1000(3) + 100(2) + 10(0) + 2$$\n$$C = 70000 + 3000 + 200 + 0 + 2$$\n$$C = 73202$$\nThe final calculated integer is $73202$.",
