            "problem": "A clinician evaluates a patient with pruritic and painful skin findings in multiple body sites. You must apply morphology-first principles that prioritize the initial lesion architecture over any superimposed changes. Use only core definitions: primary lesions arise de novo (for example, macule, patch, papule, plaque, nodule, vesicle, bulla, pustule, wheal), whereas secondary lesions reflect evolution, external trauma, or healing (for example, scale, crust, erosion, ulcer, fissure, excoriation, lichenification, atrophy, scar).

After scale removal, the underlying surface remains a broad, plateau-like palpable elevation distinctly raised above adjacent skin.\n\n- Lesion set $\\#2$ (right cheek): A cluster of tense, dome-shaped, translucent elevations, each measuring $2$–$4$ $\\mathrm{mm}$, on an erythematous base.

            "solution": "The problem statement is evaluated for validity prior to attempting a solution.\n\n### Step 1: Extract Givens\n\nThe problem provides the following definitions and patient data:\n\n**Core Definitions:**\n- **Primary lesions:** Arise de novo. Examples include macule, patch, papule, plaque, nodule, vesicle, bulla, pustule, wheal.\n- **Secondary lesions:** Reflect evolution, trauma, or healing. Examples include scale, crust, erosion, ulcer, fissure, excoriation, lichenification, atrophy, scar.\n- **Distinctions:**\n    - Fluid-filled versus solid elevations.\n    - Size thresholds (e.g., papule vs. plaque; vesicle vs. bulla).\n    - Vascular behavior on pressure (diascopy).\n\n**Patient Presentation:** A $35$-year-old person with three distinct lesion sets.\n\n- **Lesion set $\\#1$ (extensor knees):**\n    - Morphology: Sharply demarcated, erythematous, flat-topped elevated areas. Described as a broad, plateau-like palpable elevation.\n    - Size: Approximately $3.5$–$5.0$ $\\mathrm{cm}$ in diameter.\n    - Secondary changes: Overlying thick, silvery, micaceous scale. Gentle removal of scale reveals multiple pin-point bleeds.\n\n- **Lesion set $\\#2$ (right cheek):**\n    - Morphology: A cluster of tense, dome-shaped, translucent elevations on an erythematous base.\n    - Size: Each measures $2$–$4$ $\\mathrm{mm}$.\n    - Secondary changes: Approximately $60\\%$ have ruptured, leaving shallow, moist depressions (erosions) that subsequently exhibit honey-colored crust.\n    - Diascopy: Surrounding erythema blanches, but the domed contents do not flatten.\n\n- **Lesion set $\\#3$ (left forearm):**\n    - Morphology: A serpiginous, edematous, pale-rose plaque.\n    - Size: Approximately $6$ $\\mathrm{cm}$ in greatest length and $1.5$ $\\mathrm{cm}$ in width.\n    - Temporal behavior: Appears and fades spontaneously within $6$–$18$ $\\mathrm{hours}$.\n    - Associated features: Intensely pruritic, fully blanchable on pressure.\n    - Secondary changes: Multiple linear excoriations in the surrounding skin.\n\n**Task:** Classify the primary lesion type for sets $\\#1$, $\\#2$, and $\\#3$ respectively, disregarding secondary changes.\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\n\n-   **Scientific Grounding:** The problem is firmly grounded in the principles of clinical dermatology. The terminology, lesion descriptions, and pathophysiology (e.g., dermal edema in a wheal, Auspitz sign in psoriasis, vesiculation) are all scientifically accurate and standard in medical education and practice.\n-   **Well-Posed:** The problem is well-posed. It provides clear, detailed descriptions and a specific instruction—to identify the primary lesion while ignoring secondary changes. This framework allows for a single, correct answer to be derived.\n-   **Objective:** The descriptions are objective and based on observable physical characteristics (e.g., \"flat-topped,\" \"translucent,\" \"edematous,\" \"fully blanchable\").\n-   **Completeness and Consistency:** The information is sufficient and internally consistent. There are no contradictions.\n-   **Realism:** The clinical scenario, while presenting three distinct conditions, is plausible. The described lesions are classic exemplars of common dermatoses.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\n\nThe problem statement is **valid**. It is a well-formulated, scientifically sound question that tests knowledge of dermatologic morphology. The solution will proceed.\n\n### Derivation of Solution\n\nThe solution requires a morphology-first analysis of each lesion set to determine the primary lesion, as per the explicit instructions.\n\n**Analysis of Lesion Set #1 (extensor knees):**\n- The lesion is a solid, palpable elevation. The term \"elevated\" and \"palpable\" rules out flat lesions like macules or patches.\n- The size is given as $3.5$–$5.0$ $\\mathrm{cm}$. Standard dermatologic convention defines a papule as a solid, elevated lesion $\\le 1\\,\\mathrm{cm}$ in diameter. A plaque is a solid, elevated lesion $> 1\\,\\mathrm{cm}$ in diameter, often described as a \"plateau.\"\n- The description \"flat-topped\" and \"broad, plateau-like palpable elevation\" perfectly matches the definition of a plaque.\n- The \"thick, silvery, micaceous scale\" is explicitly a secondary lesion (scale) and must be disregarded in identifying the primary lesion.\n- Therefore, the primary lesion for set $\\#1$ is a **plaque**.\n\n**Analysis of Lesion Set #2 (right cheek):**\n- The lesions are \"translucent elevations,\" indicating they are fluid-filled, not solid. This rules out papules, plaques, and nodules.\n- The fluid is \"translucent,\" which is characteristic of serous fluid, not purulent exudate. This rules out a pustule.\n- The lesions are circumscribed and fluid-filled. The key distinction is size. A vesicle is a fluid-filled lesion $\\le 1\\,\\mathrm{cm}$ in diameter. A bulla is a fluid-filled lesion $> 1\\,\\mathrm{cm}$ in diameter.\n- The size of each lesion is $2\\text{--}4\\,\\mathrm{mm}$ ($0.2\\text{--}0.4\\,\\mathrm{cm}$), which falls well within the definition of a vesicle.\n- The \"ruptured\" lesions, \"moist depressions\" (erosions), and \"honey-colored crust\" are all explicitly secondary changes and must be disregarded.\n- Therefore, the primary lesion for set $\\#2$ is a **vesicle**.\n\n**Analysis of Lesion Set #3 (left forearm):**\n- The lesion is described as an \"edematous, pale-rose plaque.\" It is elevated and palpable.\n- The defining feature is its temporal nature: \"appears and fades spontaneously within $6$–$18$ $\\mathrm{hours}$.\" This transience is the pathognomonic characteristic of a wheal (also known as an urtica).\n- A standard plaque (as in set $\\#1$) is a stable, persistent lesion. The use of \"plaque\" here is descriptive of its shape but not its fundamental type, which is determined by the underlying process of transient dermal edema.\n- The description \"edematous\" and \"fully blanchable on pressure\" further supports the diagnosis of a wheal, which is caused by localized, temporary leakage of plasma from dermal vessels.\n- The \"linear excoriations\" are secondary lesions resulting from scratching and must be disregarded.\n- Therefore, the primary lesion for set $\\#3$ is a **wheal**.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe primary lesions, in order, are: **Plaque**, **Vesicle**, and **Wheal**.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n- **A. Plaque; Vesicle; Wheal**\n  - Lesion set $\\#1$ is a **Plaque**. This is consistent with our analysis.\n  - Lesion set $\\#2$ is a **Vesicle**. This is consistent with our analysis.\n  - Lesion set $\\#3$ is a **Wheal**. This is consistent with our analysis.\n  - **Verdict: Correct.**\n\n- **B. Lichenification; Erosion; Plaque**\n  - Lichenification is a secondary lesion (thickened skin from chronic rubbing). The primary lesion is a plaque. **Incorrect.**\n  - Erosion is a secondary lesion (loss of epidermis). The primary lesion is a vesicle. **Incorrect.**\n  - The primary lesion in set $\\#3$ is a wheal, not a plaque, due to its transience. **Incorrect.**\n  - **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n- **C. Nodule; Pustule; Patch**\n  - The lesion in set $\\#1$ is a plateau-like plaque, not a deep, substantial nodule. **Incorrect.**\n  - The lesion in set $\\#2$ is a vesicle (translucent fluid), not a pustule (purulent fluid). **Incorrect.**\n  - The lesion in set $\\#3$ is elevated (edematous plaque), not flat like a patch. **Incorrect.**\n  - **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n- **D. Papule; Bulla; Nodule**\n  - The lesion in set $\\#1$ is $3.5$–$5.0$ $\\mathrm{cm}$, which is a plaque, not a papule ($\\le 1\\,\\mathrm{cm}$). **Incorrect.**\n  - The lesion in set $\\#2$ is $2$–$4$ $\\mathrm{mm}$, which is a vesicle, not a bulla ($> 1\\,\\mathrm{cm}$). **Incorrect.**\n  - The lesion in set $\\#3$ is a transient, edematous wheal, not a solid, deep nodule. **Incorrect.**\n  - **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n- **E. Patch; Vesicle; Plaque**\n  - The lesion in set $\\#1$ is an elevated plaque, not a flat, non-palpable patch. **Incorrect.**\n  - The classification of lesion set $\\#2$ as a vesicle is correct.\n  - The classification of lesion set $\\#3$ as a plaque is incorrect; its transience defines it as a wheal. **Incorrect.**\n  - **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\nBased on the rigorous application of the provided dermatological definitions, only option A accurately classifies all three primary lesions.",

By definition, PASI partitions the body into four regions—head and neck, upper limbs, trunk, and lower limbs—and in each region grades three lesion attributes: erythema, induration (thickness), and desquamation (scaling). Each attribute is graded on an ordinal scale from $0$ (none) to $4$ (maximum) and summed within the region. The extent of regional involvement is captured as an area score on a six-point scale from $0$ to $6$. Each region’s contribution is weighted by the approximate proportion of total body surface area it represents, with canonical weights: head and neck $0.1$, upper limbs $0.2$, trunk $0.3$, and lower limbs $0.4$.

            "problem": "A hospitalized adult with diffuse tender erythema, flaccid bullae, and oral and ocular erosions after recent exposure to a high-risk medication is suspected to have toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN). The attending requests that you plan the bedside physical examination and immediate diagnostic sampling. Your mandate is to maximize diagnostic yield while minimizing iatrogenic epidermal detachment. You must decide how to examine the skin, hair, nails, and mucous membranes and what samples to obtain.\n\nUse the following base facts and definitions to guide your decision:\n- Toxic epidermal necrolysis is characterized by widespread keratinocyte death leading to full-thickness epidermal necrosis and easy separation of the epidermis from the dermis under minimal shear. Mucosal involvement of at least two sites is common, and the disease spectrum is often categorized by body surface area (BSA) of detachment: Stevens–Johnson syndrome (SJS) has less than $10\\%$ detachment, SJS/TEN overlap has $10$–$30\\%$, and TEN has greater than $30\\%$.\n- The Nikolsky sign is the induction of epidermal detachment by tangential pressure on intact skin. The Asboe–Hansen sign is the extension of an existing blister by vertical pressure. Both maneuvers increase shear stress on the epidermis.\n- BSA estimation by the burn “rule of nines” is a visual method that assigns $9\\%$ to the head and neck, $9\\%$ to each upper limb, $18\\%$ to the anterior trunk, $18\\%$ to the posterior trunk, $18\\%$ to each lower limb, and $1\\%$ to the perineum.\n- Histopathology of TEN shows full-thickness epidermal necrosis with sparse inflammation; direct immunofluorescence is typically negative for intercellular immunoglobulin deposition, helping distinguish TEN from autoimmune blistering diseases such as pemphigus vulgaris.\n\nWhich of the following sequential plans best satisfies the mandate to avoid provoking dangerous blistering while still obtaining diagnostic information?\n\nA. Perform a visual survey to estimate BSA of detached and detachable skin using the rule of nines, gently inspect oral, ocular, and genital mucosa without applying tangential pressure, avoid eliciting Nikolsky or Asboe–Hansen signs, obtain a Tzanck smear from an already eroded area, and perform a $4\\,\\mathrm{mm}$ punch biopsy at the margin of an existing blister (sampling both necrotic epidermis and adjacent viable skin) for routine histology and direct immunofluorescence; secure dressings without adhesive tapes.\n\nB. Confirm the diagnosis by repeatedly eliciting the Nikolsky sign on intact erythematous skin and the Asboe–Hansen sign with firm pressure, create a fresh blister if none is present, take a shave biopsy from the center of newly induced detachment, and secure the site with adhesive strips to minimize bleeding.\n\nC. Debride intact erythematous areas to expose viable dermis so that sampling is easier, perform tape stripping to evaluate stratum corneum fragility, obtain an $8\\,\\mathrm{mm}$ punch biopsy from unaffected skin to maximize tissue volume, and vigorously rub adjacent intact skin to assess the extent of inducible detachment.\n\nD. Avoid any biopsy to prevent harm, rely solely on drug history, distribution of erythema, and mucosal involvement to classify the reaction, estimate BSA from photographs, and begin treatment without histopathologic confirmation or direct immunofluorescence.",

The core mandate is to devise a plan for examination and diagnosis that maximizes diagnostic information while minimizing iatrogenic harm, specifically the extension of epidermal detachment.\n\n### Step 1: Extract Givens\n\n-   **Patient Profile**: Hospitalized adult.\n-   **Clinical Presentation**: Diffuse tender erythema, flaccid bullae, oral and ocular erosions.\n-   **History**: Recent exposure to a high-risk medication.\n-   **Suspected Diagnosis**: Toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN).\n-   **Mandate**: To plan a bedside physical examination and immediate diagnostic sampling, with two competing goals: 1) maximize diagnostic yield, and 2) minimize iatrogenic epidermal detachment.\n-   **Definition of TEN**: Widespread keratinocyte death leading to full-thickness epidermal necrosis and easy separation of the epidermis from the dermis under minimal shear.\n-   **Definition of Mucosal Involvement**: Common at two or more sites.\n-   **SJS/TEN Spectrum Classification by Body Surface Area (BSA)**:\n    -   Stevens–Johnson syndrome (SJS): $< 10\\%$ detachment.\n    -   SJS/TEN overlap: $10\\text{--}30\\%$ detachment.\n    -   TEN: $> 30\\%$ detachment.\n-   **Definition of Clinical Signs**:\n    -   Nikolsky sign: Induction of epidermal detachment by tangential pressure on intact skin.\n    -   Asboe–Hansen sign: Extension of an existing blister by vertical pressure.\n    -   Both maneuvers increase shear stress on the epidermis.\n-   **BSA Estimation Method**: The \"rule of nines\" assigns BSA percentages: head and neck ($9\\%$), each upper limb ($9\\%$), anterior trunk ($18\\%$), posterior trunk ($18\\%$), each lower limb ($18\\%$), perineum ($1\\%$).\n-   **Histopathology of TEN**: Full-thickness epidermal necrosis with sparse inflammation.\n-   **Direct Immunofluorescence (DIF) in TEN**: Typically negative for intercellular immunoglobulin deposition, distinguishing it from autoimmune blistering diseases like pemphigus vulgaris.\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\n\nThe problem statement has been evaluated for validity.\n\n-   **Scientifically Grounded**: The problem is based on established medical facts and principles of dermatology. The clinical description of TEN, its pathophysiology, diagnostic criteria, classification (SJS/TEN spectrum by BSA), and distinction from mimics like pemphigus vulgaris are all accurate and reflect current medical understanding. The mandate to maximize diagnostic yield while minimizing harm is a central tenet of clinical practice, especially in severe and fragile conditions.\n-   **Well-Posed**: The problem is structured as a decision-making task under specific constraints. It asks for the *best* plan among a set of options to achieve a clearly defined, albeit twofold, objective. A unique best answer can be determined by applying the provided medical principles.\n-   **Objective**: The problem is stated in precise, objective, and unbiased clinical language. There are no subjective or ambiguous terms.\n\nThe problem statement is scientifically sound, well-posed, and objective. It contains no contradictions, missing information, or unrealistic premises. It is a valid problem for analysis.\n\n### Step 3: Solution Derivation and Option Analysis\n\nThe mandate requires balancing two objectives: maximizing diagnostic yield and minimizing iatrogenic epidermal detachment. A successful plan must achieve a definitive diagnosis (confirming TEN and ruling out mimics) while adhering to the principle of \"do no harm\" by avoiding procedures that would worsen the skin fragility and detachment.\n\n**Maximizing Diagnostic Yield**: This requires:\n1.  Assessment of severity, which is done by estimating the percentage of BSA involved.\n2.  Histopathologic confirmation of the diagnosis. A skin biopsy examined with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) stain is required to show the characteristic full-thickness epidermal necrosis.\n3.  Exclusion of key differential diagnoses, particularly autoimmune blistering diseases like pemphigus vulgaris. This is accomplished by direct immunofluorescence (DIF) testing on a skin biopsy, which is negative in TEN but positive in pemphigus.\n\n**Minimizing Iatrogenic Detachment**: This requires:\n1.  Avoiding any unnecessary pressure, friction, or shear forces on the patient's skin, whether it is erythematous or intact-appearing.\n2.  Avoiding diagnostic maneuvers that, by their nature, cause skin detachment (e.g., Nikolsky sign).\n3.  Using appropriate techniques for procedures like biopsies and wound care (e.g., avoiding adhesive tapes).\n\nWith these principles, I will now evaluate each option.\n\n**Option A Analysis**\n\n-   **`Perform a visual survey to estimate BSA ... using the rule of nines`**: This is the correct, standard, and non-traumatic method for assessing the severity of TEN. It fulfills a key diagnostic goal without causing harm.\n-   **`gently inspect oral, ocular, and genital mucosa without applying tangential pressure`**: This is the correct way to assess for mucosal involvement, which is part of the diagnostic criteria and essential for planning supportive care (e.g., ophthalmology and gynecology consults). The gentleness respects the fragility.\n-   **`avoid eliciting Nikolsky or Asboe–Hansen signs`**: This directly follows the mandate to minimize iatrogenic detachment. While a positive Nikolsky sign is characteristic of TEN, its presence is often evident from incidental, gentle contact during routine care. Deliberately eliciting it serves no further purpose once the suspicion is high and actively causes harm by extending the necrosis.\n-   **`obtain a Tzanck smear from an already eroded area`**: This is a low-yield test but is not harmful if performed on an area that is already denuded. It does not significantly add to or detract from the quality of this plan.\n-   **`perform a 4 mm punch biopsy at the margin of an existing blister ... for routine histology and direct immunofluorescence`**: This is the ideal diagnostic procedure. A $4\\,\\mathrm{mm}$ punch is a standard size that provides sufficient tissue while minimizing the wound defect. The location—the margin of a blister—is optimal because it provides the pathologist with both necrotic and adjacent, pathologically active tissue, which is most informative. Sending tissue for both histology and DIF is crucial for confirming TEN and excluding mimics.\n-   **`secure dressings without adhesive tapes`**: This is a critical care point. Adhesives will strip the fragile epidermis upon removal. Using non-adherent dressings is mandatory.\n\n**Conclusion for Option A**: This plan perfectly balances the dual mandate. It is diagnostically comprehensive and maximally safe for the patient. It represents the standard of care. **Correct**.\n\n**Option B Analysis**\n\n-   **`Confirm the diagnosis by repeatedly eliciting the Nikolsky sign... and the Asboe–Hansen sign with firm pressure`**: This is a flagrant violation of the mandate to minimize iatrogenic harm. It actively and repeatedly induces the pathology one is trying to limit. This action is contraindicated and dangerous.\n-   **`create a fresh blister if none is present`**: This is medically indefensible and constitutes malpractice.\n-   **`take a shave biopsy from the center of newly induced detachment`**: The biopsy method is suboptimal (a punch is better for seeing the dermal-epidermal junction), the location is suboptimal (the center of a blister often shows only non-specific necrosis), and the blister itself is iatrogenically induced.\n-   **`secure the site with adhesive strips to minimize bleeding`**: This is incorrect. Adhesive tapes are strictly contraindicated in TEN.\n\n**Conclusion for Option B**: This plan is a sequence of harmful and incorrect actions. It directly contradicts the core mandate of the problem. **Incorrect**.\n\n**Option C Analysis**\n\n-   **`Debride intact erythematous areas to expose viable dermis`**: This is extremely harmful. Erythematous skin in TEN is involved in the pathological process but is not yet detached. Debriding it converts a large area of inflamed skin into a full-thickness wound, dramatically increasing morbidity and mortality.\n-   **`perform tape stripping to evaluate stratum corneum fragility`**: This is another method of applying shear stress and would induce epidermal sloughing. It is harmful and diagnostically unnecessary.\n-   **`obtain an 8 mm punch biopsy from unaffected skin`**: An $8\\,\\mathrm{mm}$ punch is unnecessarily large. A biopsy from completely unaffected skin is likely to miss the pathology, leading to a false-negative result and a missed diagnosis.\n-   **`vigorously rub adjacent intact skin`**: This is another term for eliciting the Nikolsky sign and is explicitly harmful.\n\n**Conclusion for Option C**: This plan, like option B, describes a series of actions that are dangerous, medically unsound, and in direct opposition to the patient's best interests and the stated mandate. **Incorrect**.\n\n**Option D Analysis**\n\n-   **`Avoid any biopsy to prevent harm`**: This part of the plan correctly identifies the potential for harm from procedures but takes it to an extreme that violates the other half of the mandate: to \"maximize diagnostic yield.\" A biopsy is essential for a definitive diagnosis.\n-   **`rely solely on drug history, distribution of erythema, and mucosal involvement`**: This is insufficient. Clinical suspicion is not a substitute for histopathologic confirmation, especially when life-threatening mimics (like pemphigus or staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome) are in the differential diagnosis and require vastly different treatments.\n-   **`begin treatment without histopathologic confirmation or direct immunofluorescence`**: This is dangerous. For example, treating suspected TEN (supportive care) when the patient actually has pemphigus vulgaris (which requires aggressive immunosuppression) would be a fatal error. The risk of misdiagnosis far outweighs the small, localized risk of a properly performed biopsy.\n\n**Conclusion for Option D**: This plan prioritizes avoiding harm to an unreasonable degree, leading to diagnostic negligence. It fails the mandate to \"maximize diagnostic yield\" and could lead to catastrophic mismanagement of the patient. **Incorrect**.\n\nFinal determination is that Option A is the only choice that fulfills all aspects of the clinical mandate by being both diagnostically rigorous and prioritizing patient safety.",
