            "problem": "In a full-thickness dermal wound, fibroblasts synthesize collagen that accumulates in the extracellular matrix (ECM), while enzymes such as Matrix Metalloproteinases (MMPs) degrade collagen. Assume the wound region behaves as a well-mixed control volume with constant volume and that collagen concentration, denoted by $C(t)$, is spatially uniform. Using the law of mass conservation, posit that the net rate of change of collagen concentration equals synthesis minus degradation. Assume a constant synthesis rate $k_{s}$ reflecting sustained fibroblast activity and first-order degradation $k_{d} C(t)$ reflecting enzyme-mediated turnover under approximately constant enzyme levels.

            "solution": "The problem statement is internally consistent, scientifically grounded as a simplified kinetic model of a biological process, and well-posed. We may therefore proceed with the solution.\n\nThe problem asks to construct a mass-balance model for the collagen concentration $C(t)$ in a wound. The law of mass conservation states that the net rate of change of a substance in a control volume equals the rate of synthesis minus the rate of removal.\nThe net rate of change of collagen concentration is given by the time derivative $\\frac{dC}{dt}$.\nThe synthesis rate is given as a constant, $k_s$.\nThe degradation rate is given as a first-order process, proportional to the concentration $C(t)$, written as $k_d C(t)$.\n\nCombining these terms, the mass-balance model is the following ordinary differential equation (ODE):\n$$ \\frac{dC}{dt} = k_s - k_d C(t) $$\nThis is a first-order linear non-homogeneous differential equation. We must solve it subject to the initial condition that there is no collagen at the beginning, $C(0)=0$.\n\nWe can solve this equation by separation of variables. Rearranging the equation gives:\n$$ \\frac{dC}{k_s - k_d C} = dt $$\nIntegrating both sides yields:\n$$ \\int \\frac{1}{k_s - k_d C} dC = \\int dt $$\nThe integral on the left is of the form $\\int \\frac{1}{a - bx} dx = -\\frac{1}{b}\\ln(a-bx)$. Here, $x=C$, $a=k_s$, and $b=k_d$.\n$$ -\\frac{1}{k_d} \\ln|k_s - k_d C(t)| = t + A $$\nwhere $A$ is the constant of integration. Since collagen concentration starts at $0$ and builds towards a positive steady state, $k_s - k_d C(t)$ will remain non-negative, allowing us to drop the absolute value.\n$$ \\ln(k_s - k_d C(t)) = -k_d t - k_d A $$\nExponentiating both sides:\n$$ k_s - k_d C(t) = \\exp(-k_d t - k_d A) = \\exp(-k_d A) \\exp(-k_d t) $$\nLet $B = \\exp(-k_d A)$ be a new constant.\n$$ k_s - k_d C(t) = B \\exp(-k_d t) $$\nNow, we apply the initial condition $C(0)=0$:\n$$ k_s - k_d(0) = B \\exp(-k_d \\cdot 0) $$\n$$ k_s = B \\cdot 1 \\implies B = k_s $$\nSubstituting $B=k_s$ back into the equation for $C(t)$:\n$$ k_s - k_d C(t) = k_s \\exp(-k_d t) $$\nSolving for $C(t)$:\n$$ k_d C(t) = k_s - k_s \\exp(-k_d t) $$\n$$ C(t) = \\frac{k_s}{k_d} \\left(1 - \\exp(-k_d t)\\right) $$\nThis expression describes the collagen concentration as a function of time.\n\nNext, we must determine the steady-state concentration, $C_{ss}$.

Under noncooperative ligand–receptor binding with identical and independent sites, the equilibrium is characterized by a dissociation constant $K_D$ such that the fraction of occupied receptors $f$ satisfies the mass-action equilibrium. A standard property of this framework is that when the ligand concentration equals the dissociation constant, $L = K_D$, the equilibrium fractional occupancy satisfies $f = 0.5$.\n2. The instantaneous collagen type I synthesis rate $J$ is proportional to the number of ligand-occupied receptors times an effective transcriptional efficiency $E$ that lumps downstream signaling strength per activated receptor complex. If $R_T$ denotes total receptor count per cell, the number of occupied receptors is $R_T \\times f$, so we can write\n$$\nJ \\propto (R_T \\times f) \\times E.\n$$\nFor ratios at the same time point and the same ligand concentration, any constant of proportionality cancels.\n\nGiven data:\n\n- For normal fibroblasts: $R_{T,\\mathrm{N}} = 100$, $E_{\\mathrm{N}} = 1$, $K_D = 1\\,\\mathrm{ng/mL}$.\n- For keloid fibroblasts: $R_{T,\\mathrm{K}} = 200$, $E_{\\mathrm{K}} = 1.5$, $K_D$ unchanged at $1\\,\\mathrm{ng/mL}$.\n- Both at $L = 1\\,\\mathrm{ng/mL}$.\n\nStep 1: Determine fractional occupancy $f$ in each cell type at $L = K_D$.\n\n- Because $K_D$ is the same and binding is noncooperative with identical sites, at $L = K_D$ we have $f_{\\mathrm{N}} = f_{\\mathrm{K}} = 0.5$.\n\nStep 2: Compute $J_{\\mathrm{N}}$ and $J_{\\mathrm{K}}$ up to a common proportionality constant.\n\n- Normal: $J_{\\mathrm{N}} \\propto (R_{T,\\mathrm{N}} \\times f_{\\mathrm{N}}) \\times E_{\\mathrm{N}} = (100 \\times 0.5) \\times 1 = 50$ (arbitrary units).\n- Keloid: $J_{\\mathrm{K}} \\propto (R_{T,\\mathrm{K}} \\times f_{\\mathrm{K}}) \\times E_{\\mathrm{K}} = (200 \\times 0.5) \\times 1.5 = 150$ (arbitrary units).\n\nStep 3: Form the ratio.\n\n$$\n\\frac{J_{\\mathrm{K}}}{J_{\\mathrm{N}}} = \\frac{150}{50} = 3.\n$$\n\nTherefore, under equal ligand $L = K_D$ and identical affinity, keloid fibroblasts exhibit a threefold higher collagen type I synthesis rate, driven by both increased receptor abundance (which doubles the number of occupied receptors at the same fractional occupancy) and increased transcriptional efficiency (which provides a $1.5$-fold amplification), yielding a multiplicative effect.\n\nOption-by-option analysis:\n\n- Option A: $J_{\\mathrm{K}}/J_{\\mathrm{N}} = 1$. Incorrect. While fractional occupancy $f$ is indeed the same ($0.5$) at $L = K_D$, the number of occupied receptors differs because $R_T$ differs, and downstream efficiency $E$ differs. Equal $f$ does not imply equal $J$ when $R_T$ and $E$ differ.\n\n- Option B: $J_{\\mathrm{K}}/J_{\\mathrm{N}} = 1.5$. Incorrect. This accounts only for enhanced downstream transcriptional efficiency $E_{\\mathrm{K}}/E_{\\mathrm{N}} = 1.5$ and ignores the doubled receptor abundance that doubles the number of occupied receptors at the same fractional occupancy.\n\n- Option C: $J_{\\mathrm{K}}/J_{\\mathrm{N}} = 2$. Incorrect. This accounts only for receptor abundance $R_{T,\\mathrm{K}}/R_{T,\\mathrm{N}} = 2$ and ignores the increased downstream efficiency.\n\n- Option D: $J_{\\mathrm{K}}/J_{\\mathrm{N}} = 3$. Correct. The combined effect is multiplicative under proportionality: $(R_{T,\\mathrm{K}}/R_{T,\\mathrm{N}}) \\times (E_{\\mathrm{K}}/E_{\\mathrm{N}}) = 2 \\times 1.5 = 3$, with equal fractional occupancy at $L = K_D$.\n\nThus the model predicts a threefold increase in collagen synthesis rate in keloid fibroblasts under the stated assumptions and parameters.",

Granulation tissue volume is lower in secondary intention because contraction rapidly minimizes $A_{\\mathrm{exp}}(t)$; although epithelial closure takes longer, remodeling onset is similar between the two wounds due to equivalent collagen turnover rates.\nThis is incorrect on two counts. First, granulation tissue volume is substantially higher in secondary intention ($V_{g,s} \\gg V_{g,p}$). Second, the remodeling onset times are not similar ($T_{r,p} \\approx 16.9\\,\\mathrm{day}$ vs $T_{r,s} \\approx 29.4\\,\\mathrm{day}$); they differ by approximately $12.5$ days.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\nD. If $v$ is identical, epithelial gap closure time is equivalent between primary and secondary intentions because closure depends only on keratinocyte speed, not on initial gap width; therefore granulation volumes and remodeling onset are comparable.\nThis is incorrect. The model for epithelial closure is $t_e \\approx L/v$, which explicitly depends on the gap width $L$. Since $L_p \\neq L_s$, the closure times are not equivalent. The assertion that closure time does not depend on width is a direct contradiction of the provided model.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\nE. Primary intention produces more granulation tissue because sutures increase local inflammation; despite this, epithelial gap closure and remodeling onset occur earlier than in secondary intention.\nThis is incorrect. The calculation based on the given models shows that primary intention produces substantially less granulation tissue ($V_{g,p} \\ll V_{g,s}$).
