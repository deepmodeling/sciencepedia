Two nonionic surfactants are available: surfactant $A$ with $HLB_{A} = 10$ and surfactant $B$ with $HLB_{B} = 15$. Assume the emulsion is stabilized by a binary blend of these surfactants and, under the well-tested mixing rule for nonionic surfactants, the blend HLB equals the mass-weighted average of the component HLB values.

For a binary system comprised of surfactant $A$ and surfactant $B$, this principle is expressed by the equation:\n$$HLB_{blend} = f_{A} \\cdot HLB_{A} + f_{B} \\cdot HLB_{B}$$\nHere, $HLB_{blend}$ is the target $HLB$ for the mixture, $HLB_{A}$ and $HLB_{B}$ are the $HLB$ values for surfactants $A$ and $B$, and $f_{A}$ and $f_{B}$ are their respective mass fractions in the total surfactant blend.\n\nThe mass fractions in any mixture must sum to unity. For this binary blend, this closure relation is:\n$$f_{A} + f_{B} = 1$$\nThis allows us to express the mass fraction of surfactant $B$ as a function of the mass fraction of surfactant $A$:\n$$f_{B} = 1 - f_{A}$$\nThis substitution is essential to reduce the system to a single equation with a single unknown variable, $f_{A}$.\n\nSubstituting the expression for $f_{B}$ into the HLB blending equation gives the explicit relationship needed to determine $f_{A}$:\n$$HLB_{blend} = f_{A} \\cdot HLB_{A} + (1 - f_{A}) \\cdot HLB_{B}$$\nThis is the derived expression required by the problem statement.

            "solution": "The problem as stated is scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and internally consistent. It describes a standard one-dimensional Fickian diffusion scenario, a canonical model in transport phenomena and pharmacokinetics for which a unique, stable solution exists. The provided parameters are physically realistic for drug diffusion across the human stratum corneum. All necessary information, including the governing partial differential equation, initial conditions, boundary conditions, and a precise definition of the quantity to be derived (lag time, $t_L$), is provided. Therefore, the problem is valid and a solution can be derived.\n\nThe problem is to find the lag time, $t_L$, for a substance diffusing across a membrane of thickness $h$. The process is governed by Fick's second law in one dimension:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial C}{\\partial t} = D \\frac{\\partial^{2} C}{\\partial x^{2}} $$\nwhere $C(x,t)$ is the concentration of the drug at position $x \\in [0, h]$ and time $t \\ge 0$, and $D$ is the constant diffusion coefficient.\n\nThe initial and boundary conditions are:\n1.  Initial condition: The stratum corneum (SC) is initially drug-free.\n    $$ C(x, 0) = 0 \\quad \\text{for} \\quad 0 \\le x \\le h $$\n2.  Boundary condition at the outer surface: A constant concentration $C_0$ is maintained by the vehicle.\n    $$ C(0, t) = C_0 \\quad \\text{for} \\quad t \\ge 0 $$\n3.  Boundary condition at the inner surface: The viable epidermis acts as a perfect sink.\n    $$ C(h, t) = 0 \\quad \\text{for} \\quad t \\ge 0 $$\n\nTo solve this partial differential equation with inhomogeneous boundary conditions, we express the solution $C(x,t)$ as the sum of a steady-state solution, $C_{ss}(x)$, and a transient solution, $C_{tr}(x,t)$:\n$$ C(x,t) = C_{ss}(x) + C_{tr}(x,t) $$\n\nFirst, we find the steady-state solution, which is independent of time ($ \\frac{\\partial C_{ss}}{\\partial t} = 0 $). The governing equation becomes:\n$$ D \\frac{d^{2} C_{ss}}{d x^{2}} = 0 \\implies \\frac{d^{2} C_{ss}}{d x^{2}} = 0 $$\nIntegrating twice with respect to $x$ gives a linear profile:\n$$ C_{ss}(x) = Ax + B $$\nApplying the boundary conditions to $C_{ss}(x)$:\n$C_{ss}(0) = C_0 \\implies A(0) + B = C_0 \\implies B = C_0$.\n$C_{ss}(h) = 0 \\implies Ah + C_0 = 0 \\implies A = -\\frac{C_0}{h}$.\nThus, the steady-state concentration profile is:\n$$ C_{ss}(x) = C_0 \\left(1 - \\frac{x}{h}\\right) $$\n\nNext, we find the transient solution $C_{tr}(x,t)$. It must satisfy the homogeneous version of the PDE and new, homogeneous boundary conditions.\nThe PDE for $C_{tr}$ is the same: $\\frac{\\partial C_{tr}}{\\partial t} = D \\frac{\\partial^{2} C_{tr}}{\\partial x^{2}}$.\nThe boundary conditions for $C_{tr}$ are found from $C_{tr}(x,t) = C(x,t) - C_{ss}(x)$:\n$C_{tr}(0, t) = C(0, t) - C_{ss}(0) = C_0 - C_0 = 0$.\n$C_{tr}(h, t) = C(h, t) - C_{ss}(h) = 0 - 0 = 0$.\nThe initial condition for $C_{tr}$ is:\n$C_{tr}(x, 0) = C(x, 0) - C_{ss}(x) = 0 - C_0 \\left(1 - \\frac{x}{h}\\right) = -C_0 \\left(1 - \\frac{x}{h}\\right)$.\n\nWe solve for $C_{tr}(x,t)$ using the method of separation of variables.

It is the time required to establish a near-steady-state concentration gradient across the SC.\nFor dosing intervals, a long $t_L$ implies a slow onset of drug action. This is a critical factor for acute conditions where rapid relief is necessary (e.g., pain, severe itching). For such cases, a formulation with a short $t_L$ is preferred. For chronic conditions, a slow onset may be acceptable. While dosing frequency is mainly governed by the drug's elimination half-life after reaching steady state, the lag time dictates the timing of the initial therapeutic response.\nFor vehicle selection, the lag time formula $t_L = h^2/(6D)$ highlights the vehicle's crucial role. The vehicle can modify both the effective thickness of the SC ($h$) and the drug's diffusion coefficient within it ($D$).\n1.  Vehicles can alter $h$: Occlusive vehicles (e.g., ointments) hydrate the SC, causing it to swell and potentially increasing $h$.\n2.  Vehicles can alter $D$: Hydration from occlusive vehicles dramatically increases $D$ by plasticizing the SC's lipid matrix. Chemical penetration enhancers (e.g., propylene glycol, ethanol, fatty acids) can be included in a vehicle to reversibly disrupt the SC's structure, also increasing $D$.\nSince $t_L$ is inversely proportional to $D$ and proportional to $h^2$, and the increase in $D$ upon hydration is typically far more significant than the increase in $h$, hydrating and/or penetration-enhancing vehicles are chosen to decrease $t_L$ and accelerate the onset of action. Thus, vehicle selection is a primary strategy for a formulator to control the lag time and, consequently, the speed at which a topical therapy begins to work.",
