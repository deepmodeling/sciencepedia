This exercise demonstrates how to calculate the incidence rate from surveillance data, a fundamental skill for monitoring disease trends and assessing public health burdens. By working with person-time data, you will learn to compute a precise measure of risk that is essential for comparing disease frequency across different populations and time periods .",

            "problem": "A national dermatology surveillance system monitors acute bacterial skin and soft tissue infections, including cellulitis, in a defined cohort. Over a two-year observation window, the cohort contributes a total of $600{,}000$ person-years at risk, and there are $1{,}200$ newly ascertained, laboratory-confirmed incident cases of cellulitis that meet the surveillance case definition. Assume a stable hazard for incident cellulitis across the observation window and negligible loss to follow-up relative to the accumulated person-time.\n\nStarting from the core epidemiological definition of the incidence rate (also called the incidence density) as the instantaneous occurrence of new events per unit of person-time at risk, use the person-time framework to derive the incidence rate of cellulitis for this surveillance dataset. Then scale the result to a per $100{,}000$ person-years unit for public health reporting.\n\nExpress your final numerical answer as a count per $100{,}000$ person-years. Provide the exact value. In addition, provide a brief interpretation of what this magnitude implies for population health planning in the context of the global burden of skin disease, considering how such rates inform prioritization and resource allocation.",
            "solution": "The fundamental base is the definition of the incidence rate (incidence density) in epidemiology. Let $N(t)$ denote the counting process for new incident cases in an at-risk population up to time $t$, and let $Y(t)$ denote the total person-time accumulated by the cohort at risk up to time $t$. The incidence rate $I$ is defined conceptually as the instantaneous rate of occurrence of new events per unit person-time:\n$$\nI \\equiv \\lim_{\\Delta t \\to 0} \\frac{\\Delta N(t)}{\\Delta Y(t)}.\n$$\nUnder a stable hazard over the observation window and aggregation across individuals, the empirical estimator of the incidence rate over the interval is obtained by dividing the total number of incident cases $C$ by the total accumulated person-time $PT$:\n$$\n\\hat{I} = \\frac{C}{PT}.\n$$\nHere, the surveillance system reports $C = 1{,}200$ incident cellulitis cases and $PT = 600{,}000$ person-years. Thus, the estimated incidence rate per person-year is\n$$\n\\hat{I} = \\frac{1{,}200}{600{,}000} = 0.002 \\text{ cases per person-year}.\n$$\nPublic health reporting often scales this quantity to a standard unit such as per $100{,}000$ person-years. To obtain the rate per $100{,}000$ person-years, multiply by $100{,}000$:\n$$\n\\hat{I}_{100{,}000} = 0.002 \\times 100{,}000 = 200 \\text{ cases per } 100{,}000 \\text{ person-years}.\n$$\nThis is an exact integer, so no rounding is required.\n\nInterpretation: An incidence rate of $200$ per $100{,}000$ person-years indicates that in a population accruing $1{,}000{,}000$ person-years, one would expect approximately $2{,}000$ new cases of cellulitis during the period, under similar risk conditions. For acute bacterial skin infections like cellulitis, this magnitude reflects a non-trivial burden that can strain outpatient and emergency services, antibiotic stewardship programs, and complication management (for example, abscesses, lymphangitis, and sepsis in severe cases). In the broader context of the global burden of skin disease, such an incidence rate supports prioritizing preventive strategies (for example, addressing predisposing conditions such as tinea pedis, lymphedema, and barrier disruption), enhancing access to timely diagnosis and effective antimicrobial therapy, and allocating resources for surveillance to monitor trends and antimicrobial resistance. While not directly a measure of disability such as Disability-Adjusted Life Years (DALYs), a rate of this magnitude indicates that cellulitis contributes meaningfully to healthcare utilization and morbidity, warranting coordinated public health responses, especially in settings with limited surgical and antimicrobial capacity.",

            "introduction": "After quantifying disease occurrence, epidemiologists seek to identify potential risk factors.

Let the disease state be recorded as \"case\" for individuals with physician-confirmed contact dermatitis and \"control\" for individuals without the disease, sampled from the same source population. Wet work exposure is ascertained by standardized interview and verified against employment records. There are $200$ cases and $400$ controls. Among the cases, $120$ reported wet work exposure; among the controls, $160$ reported wet work exposure. Use the foundational definitions that, in a case-control design, the odds of exposure in a group is the ratio of the number exposed to the number unexposed in that group, and the odds ratio is the ratio of the exposure odds among cases to the exposure odds among controls. Compute the crude odds ratio for the association between wet work and contact dermatitis based solely on these definitions.

            "solution": "The problem asks for the crude odds ratio using the foundational definitions applicable to case-control studies. In a case-control design, we do not estimate incidence or risk directly, because sampling is conditioned on disease status. Instead, we compute odds of exposure within each disease stratum and take their ratio to obtain the odds ratio.\n\nDefine the following counts based on the description:\n- Total cases: $200$, with $120$ exposed. Thus, unexposed cases are $200 - 120 = 80$.\n- Total controls: $400$, with $160$ exposed. Thus, unexposed controls are $400 - 160 = 240$.\n\nBy definition, the odds of exposure among cases, denoted $O_{\\text{cases}}$, is\n$$\nO_{\\text{cases}} = \\frac{\\text{exposed cases}}{\\text{unexposed cases}} = \\frac{120}{80}.\n$$\nSimilarly, the odds of exposure among controls, denoted $O_{\\text{controls}}$, is\n$$\nO_{\\text{controls}} = \\frac{\\text{exposed controls}}{\\text{unexposed controls}} = \\frac{160}{240}.\n$$\nThe crude odds ratio, denoted $\\text{OR}$, is the ratio of these two odds:\n$$\n\\text{OR} = \\frac{O_{\\text{cases}}}{O_{\\text{controls}}} = \\frac{\\frac{120}{80}}{\\frac{160}{240}}.\n$$\nWe simplify this expression algebraically:\n$$\n\\text{OR} = \\frac{120}{80} \\times \\frac{240}{160} = \\left(\\frac{120 \\times 240}{80 \\times 160}\\right).\n$$\nCompute the simplification by factoring common terms:\n- $\\frac{120}{80} = \\frac{3}{2}$,\n- $\\frac{240}{160} = \\frac{3}{2}$.\n\nTherefore,\n$$\n\\text{OR} = \\frac{3}{2} \\times \\frac{3}{2} = \\frac{9}{4}.\n$$\nThis fraction is already in lowest terms since $9$ and $4$ share no common factors other than $1$.
