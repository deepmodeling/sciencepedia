The setup is self-contained and consistent, with all necessary information provided for both the derivation and the calculation. The values are physically plausible. The problem is well-posed and objective. Therefore, the problem is deemed valid and a solution will be provided.\n\n**Part 1: Derivation of the Michaelis-Menten Equation**\n\nThe reaction proceeds via the mechanism:\n$$\nE + S \\underset{k_{-1}}{\\stackrel{k_1}{\\rightleftharpoons}} ES \\stackrel{k_{\\mathrm{cat}}}{\\rightarrow} E + P\n$$\nThe rate of product formation, which under initial-rate conditions ($[P] \\approx 0$) is the initial velocity $v_0$, is determined by the breakdown of the enzyme-substrate complex:\n$$\nv_0 = \\frac{d[P]}{dt} = k_{\\mathrm{cat}} [ES]\n$$\nTo express $v_0$ in terms of substrate concentration $[S]$ and total enzyme concentration $[E]_T$, we must find an expression for $[ES]$. We apply the steady-state approximation, which posits that the concentration of the intermediate complex $[ES]$ remains constant over the time scale of interest. This means its rate of formation equals its rate of consumption:\n$$\n\\frac{d[ES]}{dt} = 0\n$$\nThe rate of formation of $[ES]$ is from the forward reaction of $E$ and $S$. The rates of consumption of $[ES]$ are from its dissociation back to $E$ and $S$, and its conversion to $E$ and $P$. Thus, we can write the balance equation for $[ES]$:\n$$\n\\text{Rate of formation} = \\text{Rate of consumption}\n$$\n$$\nk_1 [E] [S] = k_{-1} [ES] + k_{\\mathrm{cat}} [ES] = (k_{-1} + k_{\\mathrm{cat}}) [ES]\n$$\nTo solve for $[ES]$, we need to eliminate the free enzyme concentration, $[E]$. We use the conservation of enzyme equation, which states that the total enzyme concentration $[E]_T$ is the sum of the free enzyme $[E]$ and the enzyme bound in the complex $[ES]$:\n$$\n[E]_T = [E] + [ES]\n$$\nRearranging for $[E]$ gives:\n$$\n[E] = [E]_T - [ES]\n$$\nSubstituting this expression for $[E]$ into the steady-state rate balance equation:\n$$\nk_1 ([E]_T - [ES]) [S] = (k_{-1} + k_{\\mathrm{cat}}) [ES]\n$$\nNow, we solve for $[ES]$. Expanding the left side:\n$$\nk_1 [E]_T [S] - k_1 [ES] [S] = (k_{-1} + k_{\\mathrm{cat}}) [ES]\n$$\nGroup all terms containing $[ES]$ on one side:\n$$\nk_1 [E]_T [S] = (k_{-1} + k_{\\mathrm{cat}}) [ES] + k_1 [ES] [S]\n$$\nFactor out $[ES]$:\n$$\nk_1 [E]_T [S] = [ES] (k_{-1} + k_{\\mathrm{cat}} + k_1 [S])\n$$\nIsolate $[ES]$:\n$$\n[ES] = \\frac{k_1 [E]_T [S]}{k_{-1} + k_{\\mathrm{cat}} + k_1 [S]}\n$$\nTo simplify this expression into the standard Michaelis-Menten form, we divide the numerator and the denominator by $k_1$:\n$$\n[ES] = \\frac{[E]_T [S]}{\\frac{k_{-1} + k_{\\mathrm{cat}}}{k_1} + [S]}\n$$\nWe now introduce the standard definitions. The Michaelis constant, $K_m$, is defined as:\n$$\nK_m = \\frac{k_{-1} + k_{\\mathrm{cat}}}{k_1}\n$$\nSubstituting $K_m$ into the expression for $[ES]$:\n$$\n[ES] = \\frac{[E]_T [S]}{K_m + [S]}\n$$\nFinally, we substitute this expression for $[ES]$ back into the equation for the initial rate, $v_0 = k_{\\mathrm{cat}} [ES]$:\n$$\nv_0 = k_{\\mathrm{cat}} \\left( \\frac{[E]_T [S]}{K_m + [S]} \\right) = \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{cat}} [E]_T [S]}{K_m + [S]}\n$$\nThe problem defines the maximum velocity, $V_{\\max}$, as the rate when the enzyme is fully saturated with substrate ($[ES] = [E]_T$). This corresponds to $V_{\\max} = k_{\\mathrm{cat}} [E]_T$. Substituting this definition yields the final form of the Michaelis-Menten equation:\n$$\nv_0 = \\frac{V_{\\max} [S]}{K_m + [S]}\n$$\nThis completes the derivation.\n\n**Part 2: Calculation of the Initial Rate**\n\nWe are given the following parameters for the tyrosinase-catalyzed reaction:\n- Maximum velocity, $V_{\\max} = 100\\ \\mu\\mathrm{M/min}$.\n- Michaelis constant, $K_m = 0.2\\ \\mathrm{mM}$.\n- Substrate concentration, $[S] = [\\text{L-tyrosine}] = 0.1\\ \\mathrm{mM}$.\n\nWe must ensure the units are consistent before calculation. The concentrations for $K_m$ and $[S]$ are both in millimolar ($\\mathrm{mM}$), so they are directly comparable and will cancel appropriately in the denominator term $K_m + [S]$. The resulting unit for $v_0$ will be the unit of $V_{\\max}$, which is $\\mu\\mathrm{M/min}$, as requested.\n\nSubstitute the given values into the derived Michaelis-Menten equation:\n$$\nv_0 = \\frac{(100\\ \\mu\\mathrm{M/min}) (0.1\\ \\mathrm{mM})}{0.2\\ \\mathrm{mM} + 0.1\\ \\mathrm{mM}}\n$$\n$$\nv_0 = \\frac{100 \\cdot 0.1}{0.3}\\ \\mu\\mathrm{M/min}\n$$\n$$\nv_0 = \\frac{10}{0.3}\\ \\mu\\mathrm{M/min} = \\frac{100}{3}\\ \\mu\\mathrm{M/min}\n$$\nPerforming the division gives:\n$$\nv_0 = 33.333... \\ \\mu\\mathrm{M/min}\n$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures.\n$$\nv_0 \\approx 33.33\\ \\mu\\mathrm{M/min}\n$$\nThis is the initial rate of the reaction under the specified conditions.",

            "problem": "In human melanocytes, the copper-dependent enzyme tyrosinase (TYR) catalyzes the conversion of L-tyrosine to L-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (L-DOPA), initiating eumelanin synthesis within stage II–III melanosomes. Assume initial-rate conditions and that TYR follows single-substrate Michaelis–Menten kinetics under the quasi-steady-state approximation. A small-molecule inhibitor is introduced that binds competitively at the L-tyrosine site, increasing the Michaelis constant by a factor of $2$ while leaving the maximal velocity unchanged.

Report your answer as a single dimensionless number equal to the ratio of inhibited to uninhibited initial rates. Provide the exact value; no rounding is required.",
            "solution": "The problem requires the determination of the ratio of an inhibited enzymatic reaction rate to its uninhibited rate under specific conditions. The analysis will proceed by first defining the initial velocity for the uninhibited enzyme, then for the competitively inhibited enzyme, and finally by calculating their ratio. The framework for this analysis is the Michaelis–Menten model of enzyme kinetics.\n\nThe initial velocity, $v_0$, of an enzymatic reaction following Michaelis–Menten kinetics is given by the equation:\n$$v_0 = \\frac{V_{max} [S]}{K_m + [S]}$$\nwhere $V_{max}$ is the maximal velocity, $[S]$ is the substrate concentration, and $K_m$ is the Michaelis constant.\n\nFirst, we establish the initial velocity for the uninhibited reaction, which we shall denote as $v_{uninhibited}$. The problem states that the substrate concentration is set to be equal to the uninhibited Michaelis constant, i.e., $[S] = K_m$. Substituting this condition into the Michaelis–Menten equation yields:\n$$v_{uninhibited} = \\frac{V_{max} K_m}{K_m + K_m} = \\frac{V_{max} K_m}{2 K_m}$$\nUpon simplification, by canceling the $K_m$ term from the numerator and denominator, we find the uninhibited initial rate:\n$$v_{uninhibited} = \\frac{V_{max}}{2}$$\nThis result is a fundamental property of Michaelis-Menten kinetics: when the substrate concentration equals the Michaelis constant, the reaction proceeds at exactly half of its maximal velocity.\n\nNext, we consider the case of competitive inhibition. In competitive inhibition, the inhibitor binds reversibly to the enzyme's active site, competing with the substrate. This type of inhibition affects the apparent Michaelis constant, increasing it, but does not alter the maximal velocity, $V_{max}$, as the effect of the inhibitor can be overcome by sufficiently high substrate concentrations.\n\nThe Michaelis–Menten equation for a competitively inhibited reaction is:\n$$v_{inhibited} = \\frac{V_{max} [S]}{K_m^{app} + [S]}$$\nwhere $v_{inhibited}$ is the initial velocity in the presence of the inhibitor, and $K_m^{app}$ is the apparent Michaelis constant. For competitive inhibition, $K_m^{app}$ is related to the uninhibited $K_m$ by the factor $(1 + [I]/K_I)$, where $[I]$ is the inhibitor concentration and $K_I$ is the dissociation constant of the enzyme-inhibitor complex. However, the problem provides a more direct statement: the inhibitor increases the Michaelis constant by a factor of $2$. Therefore, we can directly write:\n$$K_m^{app} = 2 K_m$$\n\nWe are asked to calculate the inhibited rate at the same substrate concentration as before, which is $[S] = K_m$ (where $K_m$ remains the Michaelis constant of the uninhibited enzyme). Substituting both $K_m^{app} = 2 K_m$ and $[S] = K_m$ into the equation for the inhibited velocity gives:\n$$v_{inhibited} = \\frac{V_{max} K_m}{(2 K_m) + K_m} = \\frac{V_{max} K_m}{3 K_m}$$\nSimplifying this expression, we find the inhibited rate:\n$$v_{inhibited} = \\frac{V_{max}}{3}$$\n\nFinally, the problem asks for the ratio of the inhibited initial rate to the uninhibited initial rate. We compute this ratio:\n$$\\frac{v_{inhibited}}{v_{uninhibited}} = \\frac{\\frac{V_{max}}{3}}{\\frac{V_{max}}{2}}$$\nThis simplifies to:\n$$\\frac{v_{inhibited}}{v_{uninhibited}} = \\frac{V_{max}}{3} \\cdot \\frac{2}{V_{max}} = \\frac{2}{3}$$\nThe maximal velocity, $V_{max}$, cancels out, yielding a dimensionless number as required. The initial rate under the specified inhibitory conditions is two-thirds of the uninhibited rate at the same substrate concentration.",

A solution will be provided.\n\n### Derivation of the Beer-Lambert Law\n\nThe problem requires a derivation starting from two points: the definition of absorbance and the continuum description of light attenuation.\n\n1.  **Definition of Absorbance:** Absorbance, $A$, is defined in terms of transmittance, $T$. Transmittance is the ratio of the transmitted light intensity, $I$, to the incident light intensity, $I_0$.\n    $$T = \\frac{I}{I_0}$$\n    Absorbance is the negative base-10 logarithm of transmittance:\n    $$A = -\\log_{10}(T) = -\\log_{10}\\left(\\frac{I}{I_0}\\right) = \\log_{10}\\left(\\frac{I_0}{I}\\right)$$\n\n2.  **Continuum Description of Light Attenuation:** Consider a beam of light passing through a homogeneous absorbing medium. The differential decrease in intensity, $dI$, as the light traverses an infinitesimal path length, $dx$, is proportional to the intensity at that point, $I(x)$, and the concentration of the absorbing species, $c$.\n    $$dI = -k I(x) c \\, dx$$\n    The constant of proportionality, $k$, is an attenuation coefficient characteristic of the absorbing substance at the given wavelength. The negative sign indicates that the intensity decreases.\n\nTo find the total attenuation over the entire path length $l$, we must integrate this differential equation. We rearrange the equation to separate variables:\n$$\\frac{dI}{I} = -k c \\, dx$$\nThe concentration $c$ is constant throughout the homogeneous solution. We integrate from the front of the cuvette (path $x=0$, intensity $I_0$) to the back (path $x=l$, intensity $I$):\n$$\\int_{I_0}^{I} \\frac{dI'}{I'} = \\int_{0}^{l} -k c \\, dx'$$\nPerforming the integration:\n$$[\\ln(I')]_{I_0}^{I} = -k c [x']_{0}^{l}$$\n$$\\ln(I) - \\ln(I_0) = -k c (l-0)$$\n$$\\ln\\left(\\frac{I}{I_0}\\right) = -k c l$$\n\nThis expression relates intensity to the natural logarithm. Absorbance uses the base-10 logarithm. We use the change of base formula for logarithms, $\\ln(x) = \\ln(10) \\log_{10}(x)$:\n$$\\ln(10) \\log_{10}\\left(\\frac{I}{I_0}\\right) = -k c l$$\n$$\\log_{10}\\left(\\frac{I}{I_0}\\right) = -\\frac{k}{\\ln(10)} c l$$\nFrom our initial definition of absorbance, $A = -\\log_{10}(I/I_0)$, we can substitute this into the equation:\n$$-A = -\\frac{k}{\\ln(10)} c l$$\n$$A = \\frac{k}{\\ln(10)} c l$$\nThe term $\\frac{k}{\\ln(10)}$ combines the substance-specific attenuation coefficient and the conversion factor between natural and base-10 logarithms. This combined term is defined as the decadic molar absorption coefficient, $\\epsilon$:\n$$\\epsilon \\equiv \\frac{k}{\\ln(10)}$$\nSubstituting $\\epsilon$ into the equation yields the desired expression, which is the Beer-Lambert law:\n$$A = \\epsilon c l$$\n\n### Calculation of Eumelanin Concentration\n\nHaving derived the relationship $A = \\epsilon c l$, we now use it to calculate the concentration $c$ of eumelanin. We rearrange the equation to solve for $c$:\n$$c = \\frac{A}{\\epsilon l}$$\nThe problem provides the following values:\n- $A = 0.600$\n- $\\epsilon = 3.000 \\times 10^{3}\\ \\mathrm{M}^{-1}\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$\n- $l = 1.000\\ \\mathrm{cm}$\n\nSubstituting these values into the equation:\n$$c = \\frac{0.600}{(3.000 \\times 10^{3}\\ \\mathrm{M}^{-1}\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}) \\times (1.000\\ \\mathrm{cm})}$$\nThe units $\\mathrm{cm^{-1}}$ and $\\mathrm{cm}$ cancel, leaving the concentration in units of $\\mathrm{M}$ (molarity, or $\\mathrm{mol/L}$).\n$$c = \\frac{0.600}{3.000 \\times 10^{3}}\\ \\mathrm{M}$$\n$$c = 0.200 \\times 10^{-3}\\ \\mathrm{M}$$\n$$c = 2.00 \\times 10^{-4}\\ \\mathrm{M}$$\nThe problem requires the final answer to be expressed in micromolar ($\\mu\\mathrm{M}$).
