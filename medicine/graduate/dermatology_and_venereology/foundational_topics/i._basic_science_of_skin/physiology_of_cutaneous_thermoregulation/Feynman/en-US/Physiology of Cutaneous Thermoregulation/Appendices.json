            "problem": "A human subject seated at rest in a warm indoor environment is considered as a closed thermodynamic system with constant mass. Over short time scales, assume no change in potential or kinetic energy and neglect conductive heat exchange with surfaces. Begin from the First Law of Thermodynamics (FLT) for a closed system, which states that the rate of change of internal energy equals the net rate of energy added to the system by heat and work. In the context of whole-body heat exchange, define the following rates: metabolic energy production $M$ (chemical energy liberated by metabolism), external mechanical work $W$ (useful work performed on the environment), convective heat transfer $C$, radiative heat transfer $R$, evaporative heat loss $E$ (including both cutaneous sweat evaporation and respiratory evaporation), and thermal energy storage in body tissues $S$ (the rate of change of the body's internal thermal energy). Using these definitions and appropriate sign conventions, construct the whole-body energy balance that relates $M$, $W$, $C$, $R$, $E$, and $S$. Then, for a subject with $M=100\\,\\mathrm{W}$, combined dry heat exchange $C+R=60\\,\\mathrm{W}$, and evaporative heat loss $E=20\\,\\mathrm{W}$, assume negligible external mechanical work so that $W=0\\,\\mathrm{W}$, and compute the value of $S$. Express the final energy storage in watts as a single real number. No rounding is required.",
            "solution": "The problem requires the derivation of the whole-body energy balance equation from the First Law of Thermodynamics and the subsequent calculation of the thermal energy storage rate, $S$.\n\nThe analysis begins with the First Law of Thermodynamics (FLT) for a closed system, as specified in the problem statement. The rate form of the FLT states that the rate of change of the total internal energy of a system, $\\frac{dU}{dt}$, is equal to the net rate of heat transfer into the system, $\\dot{Q}$, minus the rate of work done by the system on its surroundings, $\\dot{W}_{by}$.\n$$\n\\frac{dU}{dt} = \\dot{Q} - \\dot{W}_{by}\n$$\nThe problem specifies that the human subject is to be treated as this system. The total internal energy, $U$, of the body comprises multiple forms. For this problem, we consider its two main components: chemical energy, $U_{chem}$, and thermal energy, $U_{therm}$. Other forms of energy, such as macroscopic potential and kinetic energy, are assumed to be constant and their changes are neglected.\n$$\nU = U_{chem} + U_{therm}\n$$\nThe rate of change of total internal energy is therefore:\n$$\n\\frac{dU}{dt} = \\frac{dU_{chem}}{dt} + \\frac{dU_{therm}}{dt}\n$$\nWe now relate the terms provided in the problem statement to this framework.\nThe metabolic energy production rate, $M$, is defined as the rate at which chemical energy is liberated. This means the body's store of chemical energy is depleted at the rate $M$. Thus, the rate of change of chemical energy is negative.\n$$\n\\frac{dU_{chem}}{dt} = -M\n$$\nThe rate of thermal energy storage in body tissues, $S$, is explicitly defined as the rate of change of the body's internal thermal energy.\n$$\n\\frac{dU_{therm}}{dt} = S\n$$\nSubstituting these expressions into the equation for the rate of change of total internal energy gives:\n$$\n\\frac{dU}{dt} = S - M\n$$\nNext, we analyze the heat and work terms of the FLT. The rate of work done by the system, $\\dot{W}_{by}$, corresponds to the external mechanical work, $W$.\n$$\n\\dot{W}_{by} = W\n$$\nThe net rate of heat transfer into the system, $\\dot{Q}$, is the sum of all thermal exchanges with the environment. The problem defines rates for convective heat transfer ($C$), radiative heat transfer ($R$), and evaporative heat loss ($E$). The standard convention in thermophysiology, supported by the phrasing \"evaporative heat loss\", is to define these terms as positive for heat loss *from* the body. Therefore, the heat transfer *into* the system is the negative sum of these loss terms.\n$$\n\\dot{Q} = -(C + R + E)\n$$\nWe can now substitute all these components back into the original FLT equation:\n$$\nS - M = -(C + R + E) - W\n$$\nThis equation directly relates all the specified quantities. To obtain the whole-body energy balance in its conventional form, we rearrange the equation to group energy production on one side and energy dissipation and storage on the other.\n$$\nM - W = C + R + E + S\n$$\nThis is the constructed whole-body energy balance equation. It states that the net energy generated by the body (metabolic production minus external work) is balanced by the sum of all modes of heat loss and the rate of energy storage.\n\nThe second part of the task is to compute the value of $S$ for the given conditions. We can rearrange the equation to solve for $S$:\n$$\nS = M - W - (C + R) - E\n$$\nThe problem provides the following numerical values:\nMetabolic energy production, $M = 100\\,\\mathrm{W}$.\nExternal mechanical work, $W = 0\\,\\mathrm{W}$.\nCombined convective and radiative heat exchange, $C+R = 60\\,\\mathrm{W}$. As this is a positive value, it represents a net heat loss from the body to the environment.\nEvaporative heat loss, $E = 20\\,\\mathrm{W}$.\n\nSubstituting these values into the equation for $S$:\n$$\nS = 100\\,\\mathrm{W} - 0\\,\\mathrm{W} - 60\\,\\mathrm{W} - 20\\,\\mathrm{W}\n$$\n$$\nS = (100 - 60 - 20)\\,\\mathrm{W}\n$$\n$$\nS = 20\\,\\mathrm{W}\n$$\nThe result, $S = 20\\,\\mathrm{W}$, is positive, which signifies that the body is storing thermal energy at a rate of $20$ Joules per second. This implies that the body's total heat production ($100\\,\\mathrm{W}$) exceeds its total heat loss to the environment ($60\\,\\mathrm{W} + 20\\,\\mathrm{W} = 80\\,\\mathrm{W}$), with the difference being stored, leading to an increase in body temperature.",

            "introduction": "The body actively regulates its temperature by modulating heat flow from the core to the skin, primarily through changes in cutaneous blood flow. This exercise delves into the profound impact of this physiological control, connecting the biological act of vasodilation to the physical principles of fluid dynamics described by the Hagen-Poiseuille equation. You will discover how a small change in the radius of cutaneous arterioles leads to a dramatic, non-linear increase in heat transport capacity, illustrating the power and efficiency of the body's thermoregulatory mechanisms .",

            "problem": "Cutaneous vasodilation during heat stress increases skin blood flow and thereby augments convective heat removal from the skin. Consider a small, thermally homogeneous patch of glabrous skin perfused by $N$ identical, straight arterioles of initial radius $r_0$ and fixed length $L$, each supplying capillary networks in parallel. During active vasodilation, smooth muscle relaxation increases arteriole radius to $r_1 = 1.2\\,r_0$. Assume the following biophysical conditions hold over the short timescale of interest: blood behaves as a Newtonian fluid of constant dynamic viscosity $\\mu$, flow is steady and laminar, the perfusion pressure drop $\\Delta P$ from proximal arteriole to venule remains constant, vessel length $L$ is unchanged, and $N$ does not change.

Do not include units.",
            "solution": "The solution is derived from two fundamental physical principles: convective heat transport and laminar fluid flow in a cylindrical tube.\n\nFirst, we consider the convective heat transport. The rate of heat dissipation, $\\dot{Q}_{\\text{heat}}$, for a single arteriole is determined by the mass flow rate of blood, $\\dot{m}$, the specific heat capacity of blood, $c_p$, and the arteriovenous temperature difference, $\\Delta T$. The governing equation is:\n$$ \\dot{Q}_{\\text{heat}} = \\dot{m} c_p \\Delta T $$\nThe mass flow rate $\\dot{m}$ is related to the volumetric flow rate $\\dot{V}$ and the constant blood density $\\rho$ by the relation $\\dot{m} = \\rho \\dot{V}$. Substituting this into the equation for heat dissipation yields:\n$$ \\dot{Q}_{\\text{heat}} = \\rho c_p \\Delta T \\dot{V} $$\nThe skin patch is perfused by $N$ identical arterioles. Assuming they contribute in parallel, the total convective heat dissipation from the patch, $\\dot{Q}_{\\text{heat,total}}$, is the sum of the individual contributions:\n$$ \\dot{Q}_{\\text{heat,total}} = N \\dot{Q}_{\\text{heat}} = N \\rho c_p \\Delta T \\dot{V} $$\nThe problem states that $N$, $\\rho$, $c_p$, and $\\Delta T$ are constant. Therefore, the total heat dissipation is directly proportional to the volumetric flow rate per arteriole, $\\dot{V}$.\n$$ \\dot{Q}_{\\text{heat,total}} \\propto \\dot{V} $$\n\nSecond, we model the volumetric flow rate $\\dot{V}$ through a single arteriole. The problem specifies that the flow is steady and laminar, and blood behaves as a Newtonian fluid. Under these conditions, the flow in a rigid cylindrical tube is described by the Hagen-Poiseuille equation. This equation relates the volumetric flow rate $\\dot{V}$ to the pressure drop $\\Delta P$ across the tube, the dynamic viscosity of the fluid $\\mu$, the tube length $L$, and its radius $r$:\n$$ \\dot{V} = \\frac{\\pi \\Delta P}{8 \\mu L} r^4 $$\nThe problem states that the perfusion pressure drop $\\Delta P$, the viscosity $\\mu$, and the vessel length $L$ remain constant. Consequently, the volumetric flow rate $\\dot{V}$ is a function only of the arteriole radius $r$. Specifically, it is proportional to the fourth power of the radius:\n$$ \\dot{V} \\propto r^4 $$\n\nCombining these two results, we can establish how the total heat dissipation scales with the arteriole radius. Since $\\dot{Q}_{\\text{heat,total}} \\propto \\dot{V}$ and $\\dot{V} \\propto r^4$, it follows that:\n$$ \\dot{Q}_{\\text{heat,total}} \\propto r^4 $$\nWe can write this relationship with a proportionality constant $C$, which encapsulates all the constant parameters ($N$, $\\rho$, $c_p$, $\\Delta T$, $\\pi$, $\\Delta P$, $\\mu$, $L$):\n$$ \\dot{Q}_{\\text{heat,total}}(r) = C r^4 $$\nLet $\\dot{Q}_{\\text{heat},0}$ be the initial total heat dissipation when the arteriole radius is $r_0$, and $\\dot{Q}_{\\text{heat},1}$ be the final total heat dissipation when the radius is $r_1$.\n$$ \\dot{Q}_{\\text{heat},0} = C r_0^4 $$\n$$ \\dot{Q}_{\\text{heat},1} = C r_1^4 $$\nWe are asked to calculate the fractional increase in total convective heat dissipation, which is defined as:\n$$ \\text{Fractional Increase} = \\frac{\\dot{Q}_{\\text{heat},1} - \\dot{Q}_{\\text{heat},0}}{\\dot{Q}_{\\text{heat},0}} $$\nSubstituting the expressions for $\\dot{Q}_{\\text{heat},0}$ and $\\dot{Q}_{\\text{heat},1}$:\n$$ \\text{Fractional Increase} = \\frac{C r_1^4 - C r_0^4}{C r_0^4} = \\frac{C(r_1^4 - r_0^4)}{C r_0^4} = \\frac{r_1^4}{r_0^4} - 1 = \\left(\\frac{r_1}{r_0}\\right)^4 - 1 $$\nThe problem provides that the final radius $r_1$ is $20\\%$ larger than the initial radius $r_0$, such that $r_1 = 1.2 \\, r_0$. The ratio of the radii is therefore:\n$$ \\frac{r_1}{r_0} = 1.2 $$\nSubstituting this value into the expression for the fractional increase:\n$$ \\text{Fractional Increase} = (1.2)^4 - 1 $$\nNow we perform the calculation:\n$$ (1.2)^2 = 1.44 $$\n$$ (1.2)^4 = (1.2^2)^2 = (1.44)^2 = 2.0736 $$\nThe fractional increase is then:\n$$ \\text{Fractional Increase} = 2.0736 - 1 = 1.0736 $$\nThus, a $20\\%$ increase in arteriole radius results in a $107.36\\%$ increase in convective heat dissipation under the specified conditions.",
