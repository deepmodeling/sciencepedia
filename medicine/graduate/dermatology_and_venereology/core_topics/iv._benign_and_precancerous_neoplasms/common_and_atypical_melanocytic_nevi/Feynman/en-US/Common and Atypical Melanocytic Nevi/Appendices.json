            "solution": "The problem statement is subjected to validation.\n\n**Step 1: Extract Givens**\n-   Histopathology: \"benign-appearing melanocytic proliferation\"\n-   Histopathology: \"symmetric architecture\"\n-   Histopathology: \"maturation with descent\"\n-   Immunohistochemistry (IHC): \"BRAF using a mutation-specific antibody demonstrates cytoplasmic positivity consistent with the BRAF V600E mutant protein\"\n-   Targeted Sequencing: \"wild-type neuroblastoma RAS viral oncogene homolog (NRAS)\"\n-   Targeted Sequencing: \"wild-type telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) promoter\"\n-   Question: asking for the most likely nevus subtype based solely on the provided findings.\n\n**Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens**\n-   **Scientific Grounding:** The problem describes a set of histopathological and molecular findings that are common in dermatopathology. The genes *BRAF*, *NRAS*, and *TERT* are well-established drivers and markers in the pathogenesis of melanocytic neoplasms. The link between their mutational status and specific nevus subtypes is a core concept in modern dermatopathology. The problem is scientifically sound.\n-   **Well-Posedness:** The question asks for the \"most likely\" diagnosis given a specific, internally consistent set of data. This is a standard problem of differential diagnosis based on clinicopathological and molecular correlation. A unique and well-reasoned answer can be derived from the established scientific literature. The problem is well-posed.\n-   **Objectivity:** The descriptive terms (\"symmetric architecture\", \"maturation with descent\") and molecular results (*BRAF* V600E positivity, wild-type *NRAS*, wild-type *TERT* promoter) are objective, standard, and clearly defined findings in the field. The problem is objective.\n-   **Consistency and Completeness:** The findings are mutually consistent. A histologically benign nevus with a *BRAF* mutation is a classic presentation. The presence of wild-type *NRAS* is expected, as *BRAF* and *NRAS* mutations are typically mutually exclusive in nevi. The wild-type *TERT* promoter finding is consistent with a benign lesion, as *TERT* promoter mutations are a common secondary event in the progression to melanoma. The information is sufficient to answer the question.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem statement is valid. It is scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and internally consistent. The solution process will now proceed.\n\n**Derivation of the Solution**\nThe fundamental principle is to correlate the given molecular signature with the known genetic drivers of different melanocytic nevus subtypes. Melanocytic proliferations are primarily driven by activating mutations in the Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway.\n\n1.  **Analyze the Molecular Signature:**\n    -   **`*BRAF*` `V600E` Mutation:** This is an activating mutation in the *BRAF* gene, a key component of the MAPK pathway. This specific mutation is the most common genetic event in melanocytic nevi. It characteristically triggers an initial burst of proliferation that is subsequently arrested by oncogene-induced senescence, leading to a stable, benign nevus.\n    -   **Wild-Type `*NRAS*`:** The *NRAS* gene is another component of the MAPK pathway, upstream of *BRAF*. Activating mutations in *NRAS* and *BRAF* are the two most common initiating events in nevi, but they are almost always mutually exclusive. The finding of wild-type *NRAS* is therefore expected in a *BRAF*-mutated lesion.\n    -   **Wild-Type `*TERT*` Promoter:** Mutations in the promoter of the *TERT* gene, which lead to enhanced telomerase expression and cellular immortalization, are a key step in the progression from nevus to melanoma. The absence of a *TERT* promoter mutation strongly supports the benign nature of the lesion, consistent with the histology.\n\n2.  **Correlate with Nevus Subtypes:**\n    The challenge is to identify which nevus subtype is defined by a *BRAF* V600E mutation.\n\n    -   **Common Acquired Melanocytic Nevi:** These are the most prevalent moles in the human population. Approximately 80% of these nevi are driven by an activating *BRAF* mutation, predominantly V600E. The presented findings—benign symmetrical architecture, maturation, *BRAF* V600E positivity, and wild-type *NRAS* and *TERT* promoter—are the quintessential features of a common acquired melanocytic nevus.\n\n    -   **Congenital Melanocytic Nevi:** While small congenital nevi can have *BRAF* mutations, medium and large congenital nevi are classically associated with activating mutations in *NRAS*. The given wild-type *NRAS* status makes this diagnosis less likely.\n\n    -   **Spitz Nevi:** Classic Spitz nevi are genetically distinct. They are characterized by the absence of *BRAF* and *NRAS* mutations. Instead, they are typically driven by various kinase gene fusions involving *ALK*, *ROS1*, *NTRK1*, *NTRK3*, *MET*, or *RET*. The presence of a *BRAF* V600E mutation effectively excludes a diagnosis of classic Spitz nevus.\n\n    -   **Blue Nevi:** Blue nevi and their variants (including cellular blue nevus) are defined by activating mutations in the G-protein alpha subunits *GNAQ* or *GNA11*. These lesions are characteristically negative for *BRAF* and *NRAS* mutations.\n\n    -   **Deep Penetrating Nevi:** These are now considered part of the blue nevus spectrum molecularly. They often show mutations in *GNAQ* or *GNA11*, frequently accompanied by mutations in *CTNNB1* (beta-catenin). They are not associated with *BRAF* mutations.\n\n**Conclusion:** The combination of benign, symmetric histology with maturation, a *BRAF* V600E mutation, and wild-type *NRAS* is the specific and classic profile of a common acquired melanocytic nevus.\n\n**Option-by-Option Analysis**\n\n**A. Common acquired melanocytic nevus (junctional or compound)**\nThis nevus subtype is most frequently characterized by an activating *BRAF* V600E mutation (found in up to 80% of cases) which drives the initial proliferation before senescence arrests growth. The benign histology described (symmetry, maturation) is classic for this lesion. The genetic profile provided is a textbook match.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. Medium congenital melanocytic nevus**\nThis nevus subtype is most commonly associated with activating mutations in *NRAS*, not *BRAF*. The problem statement specifies wild-type *NRAS*, making this option highly unlikely.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. Spitz nevus (classic)**\nClassic Spitz nevi are defined molecularly by specific kinase fusions and the characteristic absence of *BRAF* and *NRAS* mutations. The identified *BRAF* V600E mutation is exclusionary for this diagnosis.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. Blue nevus (common)**\nThis nevus subtype is driven by mutations in *GNAQ* or *GNA11*. It is, by definition, negative for *BRAF* and *NRAS* mutations.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**E. Deep penetrating nevus**\nThis nevus is part of the blue nevus family, sharing a molecular pathogenesis involving *GNAQ* or *GNA11* mutations. It does not harbor *BRAF* mutations.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**",

            "problem": "A dermatopathology service receives a shave excision from the mid-back of a $34$-year-old patient. On hematoxylin and eosin sections, there is a predominantly junctional and focally compound melanocytic proliferation with nests and single melanocytes at the dermoepidermal junction. The lesion appears to show limited pagetoid scatter: a small number of solitary melanocytes are present above the basal layer in a central zone directly overlying several junctional nests, without obvious involvement of adnexal ostia. The clinician asks whether this lesion should be classified as early melanoma (melanoma in situ or microinvasive melanoma) rather than a benign nevus with focal upward migration.\n\nUse the following fundamental bases to reason toward a classification: in melanocytic proliferations, architectural disorder (asymmetry, poor circumscription, confluent lentiginous growth), cytologic atypia (nuclear enlargement, irregular nuclear contours, prominent nucleoli), maturation with descent (progressive reduction in nest size and cell size with depth in the dermis), proliferation pattern (presence and location of mitotic figures), and the distribution of pagetoid scatter (focal over nests versus irregular, widespread, or adnexal-involving) are key determinants. Ancillary immunohistochemistry can contribute: diffuse nuclear staining for Preferentially Expressed Antigen in Melanoma (PRAME) supports melanoma, whereas retained expression of Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor 2A (p16) and a low dermal Ki-67 labeling index favor benign nevus.\n\nWhich set of additional histopathologic and ancillary criteria, if present in this lesion with otherwise limited pagetoid scatter, would allow classification as early melanoma rather than a benign nevus with focal upward migration?\n\nA.

            "solution": "The user has provided a problem from the field of dermatopathology, concerning the differential diagnosis of a melanocytic lesion. I will first validate the problem statement and then proceed to a detailed solution.\n\n### Problem Validation\n\n**Step 1: Extract Givens**\n\n*   **Patient and Specimen**: A shave excision from the mid-back of a $34$-year-old patient.\n*   **Initial Histologic Findings**:\n    *   A predominantly junctional and focally compound melanocytic proliferation.\n    *   Presence of nests and single melanocytes at the dermoepidermal junction.\n    *   Limited pagetoid scatter described as a small number of solitary melanocytes above the basal layer, confined to a central zone directly overlying several junctional nests.\n    *   No involvement of adnexal ostia by the pagetoid scatter.\n*   **Diagnostic Dilemma**: Differentiating between early melanoma (melanoma in situ or microinvasive melanoma) and a benign nevus with focal upward migration.\n*   **Fundamental Diagnostic Principles**:\n    *   **Architecture**: asymmetry, poor circumscription, confluent lentiginous growth.\n    *   **Cytology**: atypia (nuclear enlargement, irregular contours, prominent nucleoli).\n    *   **Maturation**: maturation with descent in the dermis.\n    *   **Proliferation**: presence and location of mitotic figures.\n    *   **Pagetoid Scatter Pattern**: focal over nests vs. irregular, widespread, or adnexal-involving.\n*   **Ancillary Diagnostic Principles**:\n    *   **PRAME**: Diffuse nuclear staining for Preferentially Expressed Antigen in Melanoma (PRAME) supports melanoma.\n    *   **p16**: Retained expression of Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor 2A (p16) favors a benign nevus.\n    *   **Ki-67**: A low dermal Ki-67 labeling index favors a benign nevus.\n*   **Question**: Which set of additional histopathologic and ancillary criteria would allow classification as early melanoma?\n\n**Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens**\n\n*   **Scientific Grounding**: The problem is scientifically grounded. It presents a classic and common diagnostic challenge in dermatopathology. The described lesion with limited, central pagetoid scatter is a well-known borderline entity. The principles listed for differential diagnosis—architectural features, cytologic atypia, maturation, mitotic activity, pattern of pagetoidism, and the use of ancillary markers like PRAME, p16, and Ki-67—are all standard-of-care factors used by pathologists to distinguish benign nevi from melanoma. The information is factually correct and based on established principles of pathology.\n*   **Well-Posed**: The problem is well-posed. It establishes a baseline scenario (a lesion with an ambiguous feature) and asks for a list of additional findings that would resolve the ambiguity in favor of a specific diagnosis (melanoma). This structure allows for a unique and meaningful solution based on the provided diagnostic framework.\n*   **Objective**: The problem is stated objectively, using precise and standardized medical terminology (e.g., \"pagetoid scatter,\" \"confluent lentiginous growth,\" \"maturation with descent\"). There is no subjective or opinion-based language.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\n\nThe problem statement is valid. It is a well-formulated, scientifically sound, and objective question within its specified domain. I will now proceed with the solution.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe central task is to identify the set of features that, when superimposed on the initial finding of a melanocytic lesion with limited central pagetoid scatter, would provide sufficient evidence to diagnose early melanoma. The provided fundamental principles state that melanoma is characterized by architectural disorder, significant cytologic atypia, lack of maturation, abnormal proliferation, and a malignant pattern of pagetoid scatter. Ancillary studies should align with these findings.\n\nLet's dissect the criteria for melanoma based on the principles provided:\n1.  **Architecture**: Must be disordered (asymmetric, poorly circumscribed, confluent lentiginous growth).\n2.  **Cytology**: Must show significant atypia.\n3.  **Maturation**: Must be absent (dermal cells are as atypical as junctional cells).\n4.  **Proliferation**: Mitoses, especially deep or atypical, and a high Ki-67 index are expected.\n5.  **Pagetoid Scatter**: Must be widespread and irregular, not confined centrally over nests.\n6.  **Ancillary IHC**: PRAME should be diffusely positive, and p16 expression should be lost or significantly reduced.\n\nThe correct option will be the one that combines these features to paint a convincing picture of malignancy.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. Overall symmetry and sharp lateral circumscription; junctional nests with focal bridging; pagetoid melanocytes restricted to the centers of nests; evident maturation with descent in the dermal component; absence of dermal mitoses; Ki-67 labeling index in dermal melanocytes <3%; retained p16 expression; PRAME negative or only focal nuclear staining in <10% of lesional cells.**\n*   **Analysis**: This option describes features overwhelmingly characteristic of a benign nevus, possibly with dysplastic features (\"focal bridging\"). Symmetry, sharp circumscription, maturation with descent, absence of dermal mitoses, a low Ki-67 index, retained p16, and negative/focal PRAME are all strong indicators of a benign process. The pagetoid scatter pattern is described as the benign type. This set of findings would lead to a diagnosis of a benign nevus, not melanoma.\n*   **Verdict**: **Incorrect**.\n\n**B. Architectural asymmetry with poor lateral circumscription; confluent lentiginous proliferation extending beyond the lateral edges of nests; irregular, non-nest-centered pagetoid scatter involving multiple epidermal levels and extending to adnexal ostia; marked cytologic atypia at the junction; absence of maturation with descent; presence of dermal mitoses (>0 per $\\text{mm}^2$) near the junctional component; elevated Ki-67 labeling index in junctional and dermal melanocytes (>10%); diffuse strong nuclear PRAME positivity in the majority of lesional cells; decreased to lost p16 expression.**\n*   **Analysis**: This option presents a complete \"checklist\" for melanoma. It includes major criteria such as architectural disorder (asymmetry, poor circumscription, confluent lentiginous growth), significant cytologic atypia, lack of maturation, and presence of dermal mitoses. It also describes the malignant pattern of pagetoid scatter (widespread, irregular, adnexal-involving). The ancillary studies fully support malignancy: elevated Ki-67, diffuse PRAME positivity, and loss of p16. This constellation of findings is diagnostic of melanoma.\n*   **Verdict**: **Correct**.\n\n**C. Symmetric silhouette with crisp borders; predominantly nested junctional growth with rare single melanocytes extending $1$ rete ridge beyond nests; mild cytologic atypia; single superficial dermal mitotic figure adjacent to an area of inflammation; Ki-67 labeling index in dermal melanocytes <5%; equivocal PRAME staining in approximately 15% of nuclei; retained p16 expression.**\n*   **Analysis**: This describes a lesion with mixed features, creating a diagnostic gray zone. The architecture (\"Symmetric silhouette with crisp borders\"), mild atypia, and retained p16 favor a benign diagnosis (likely a dysplastic nevus). The single dermal mitosis is a major red flag for melanoma, but its significance can be debated in the presence of inflammation and other benign features. The Ki-67 is low-to-intermediate, and the PRAME result is equivocal. While concerning, this set of findings is not sufficient for a definitive classification of melanoma and would likely be diagnosed as a \"melanocytic proliferation with severe atypia\" or a similar indeterminate category, warranting complete excision but falling short of a firm melanoma diagnosis.\n*   **Verdict**: **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. Limited central pagetoid scatter above junctional nests; absence of dermal component; clinical lesion diameter >6 mm and variegated color by history; MART-1 (Melanoma Antigen Recognized by T cells 1) diffusely positive and S100 protein positive; no dermal mitoses identifiable; Ki-67 labeling index overall <5%.**\n*   **Analysis**: This option is largely unhelpful. The clinical features (>6 mm diameter, variegation) are suggestive but are not histologic criteria. MART-1 and S100 are lineage markers, meaning they stain both benign nevi and melanomas; their positivity is expected and non-discriminatory. The absence of a dermal component means we are only considering a junctional process (melanoma in situ vs. junctional nevus). The key histologic findings provided—limited central pagetoid scatter and a low Ki-67 index—actually argue *against* melanoma. This set of criteria is insufficient for diagnosis.\n*   **Verdict**: **Incorrect**.\n\n**E. Pagetoid melanocytes confined to the stratum spinosum centrally; junctional nests show clefting and prominent eosinophilic globules; spindle and epithelioid melanocytes with maturation present in the dermis; no dermal mitoses; high-power fields show prominent Kamino bodies; Ki-67 labeling index <5% in dermal melanocytes; PRAME negative; p16 retained; lesion located on the lower extremity of a 12-year-old patient.**\n*   **Analysis**: This option describes a textbook Spitz nevus. Key features include the cell morphology (spindle and epithelioid), maturation, clefting around junctional nests, and the pathognomonic finding of Kamino bodies (eosinophilic globules of basement membrane material). The anciallary profile (low Ki-67, negative PRAME, retained p16) and clinical context (12-year-old patient) are all classic for a Spitz nevus. A Spitz nevus is a benign entity, although some variants can be histologically challenging to distinguish from melanoma.\n*   **Verdict**: **Incorrect**.",

This advanced problem bridges the gap between diagnosis and decision-making by applying Bayesian statistical reasoning to a common clinical scenario: a dysplastic nevus with positive margins.

            "problem": "A patient underwent a tangential shave removal of a pigmented lesion on the upper back. Histopathology demonstrated a severely dysplastic melanocytic nevus with transected lateral margins. Prior institutional data indicate that, among severely dysplastic nevi that are transected at the margin, the baseline probability that a residual melanocytic lesion remains at the site is $P_0 = 0.65$. Pre-excision dermoscopy documented a dermoscopic high-risk pattern (DHP; defined as marked asymmetry, atypical pigment network, and irregular streaks), and the pathology report quantified the lateral junctional extension at the closest transected edge as $L_{\\text{obs}} = 1.7$ millimeters. From a validation cohort, the DHP, when present, has sensitivity $S_1 = 0.72$ and specificity $C_1 = 0.68$ for the presence of residual melanocytic lesion at the biopsy site. The distribution of lateral junctional extension at the transected edge, $L$, conditional on residual lesion presence ($R$) versus absence ($\\bar{R}$), is approximately Gaussian with equal standard deviation: under $R$, $L \\sim \\mathcal{N}(\\mu_R, \\sigma)$ with $\\mu_R = 2.0$ millimeters and $\\sigma = 0.6$ millimeters; under $\\bar{R}$, $L \\sim \\mathcal{N}(\\mu_{\\bar{R}}, \\sigma)$ with $\\mu_{\\bar{R}} = 0.8$ millimeters and the same $\\sigma = 0.6$ millimeters. Assume that, conditional on $R$ or $\\bar{R}$, the dermoscopic finding and the histologic lateral extension are independent.\n\nUsing only foundational statistical principles and clinically established definitions, derive the posterior probability $P_{\\text{post}}$ that a residual melanocytic lesion remains after the shave, by appropriately combining the dermoscopic DHP and the measured $L_{\\text{obs}}$ with the baseline $P_0$. For decision-making, assume a simple expected-loss framework in which the loss for performing a re-excision when no residual lesion is present is $L_{\\text{re}} = 0.15$ (dimensionless harm units), and the loss for not re-excising when a residual lesion is present is $L_{\\text{miss}} = 0.85$ (dimensionless harm units). Under this framework, the re-excision decision threshold for $P_{\\text{post}}$ is $T = \\dfrac{L_{\\text{re}}}{L_{\\text{re}} + L_{\\text{miss}}}$.\n\nCompute the decision index $I = P_{\\text{post}} - T$. Express the final answer as a decimal with no units, rounded to four significant figures.",
            "solution": "The problem requires the computation of a decision index $I = P_{\\text{post}} - T$, where $P_{\\text{post}}$ is the posterior probability of a residual melanocytic lesion and $T$ is the decision threshold for re-excision. The calculation proceeds in two main stages: first, the calculation of the threshold $T$, and second, the calculation of the posterior probability $P_{\\text{post}}$ using Bayesian inference.\n\nFirst, we calculate the decision threshold $T$. The problem defines the threshold in terms of the losses associated with the two possible decision errors:\n$L_{\\text{re}}$: The loss for performing a re-excision when no residual lesion is present.\n$L_{\\text{miss}}$: The loss for not re-excising when a residual lesion is present.\nThe given values are $L_{\\text{re}} = 0.15$ and $L_{\\text{miss}} = 0.85$.\nThe formula for the threshold is provided as:\n$$T = \\frac{L_{\\text{re}}}{L_{\\text{re}} + L_{\\text{miss}}}$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$T = \\frac{0.15}{0.15 + 0.85} = \\frac{0.15}{1.00} = 0.15$$\n\nNext, we calculate the posterior probability, $P_{\\text{post}}$, that a residual lesion remains. Let $R$ denote the event that a residual lesion is present, and $\\bar{R}$ denote the event that no residual lesion is present. The baseline (prior) probability is given as $P(R) = P_0 = 0.65$. Consequently, the prior probability of no residual lesion is $P(\\bar{R}) = 1 - P(R) = 1 - 0.65 = 0.35$.\n\nWe are given two pieces of evidence to update this prior probability:\n1.  $E_1$: The presence of a dermoscopic high-risk pattern (DHP).\n2.  $E_2$: The measured lateral junctional extension $L_{\\text{obs}} = 1.7$ millimeters.\n\nThe problem states that these two pieces of evidence are conditionally independent given the true state ($R$ or $\\bar{R}$). We can use Bayes' theorem to find the posterior probability $P(R|E_1, E_2)$. A convenient method is to use the odds form of Bayes' theorem. The posterior odds are the prior odds multiplied by the Bayes factors for each piece of evidence.\n\nPosterior Odds = Prior Odds $\\times$ Bayes Factor($E_1$) $\\times$ Bayes Factor($E_2$)\n$$\\frac{P(R|E_1, E_2)}{P(\\bar{R}|E_1, E_2)} = \\frac{P(R)}{P(\\bar{R})} \\times \\frac{P(E_1|R)}{P(E_1|\\bar{R})} \\times \\frac{P(E_2|R)}{P(E_2|\\bar{R})}$$\n\nThe prior odds are:\n$$\\text{Prior Odds} = \\frac{P(R)}{P(\\bar{R})} = \\frac{0.65}{0.35} = \\frac{13}{7}$$\n\nThe Bayes factor for $E_1$ (DHP) is the ratio of its likelihoods. The likelihood $P(E_1|R)$ is the sensitivity, $S_1 = 0.72$. The likelihood $P(E_1|\\bar{R})$ is the false positive rate, which is $1 - \\text{specificity}$. The specificity is given as $C_1 = 0.68$, so $P(E_1|\\bar{R}) = 1 - C_1 = 1 - 0.68 = 0.32$.\nThus, the Bayes factor for $E_1$ is:\n$$\\text{Bayes Factor}(E_1) = \\frac{P(E_1|R)}{P(E_1|\\bar{R})} = \\frac{0.72}{0.32} = \\frac{72}{32} = \\frac{9}{4}$$\n\nThe Bayes factor for $E_2$ (the measurement $L_{\\text{obs}}$) is the ratio of the probability density functions (PDFs) evaluated at $L_{\\text{obs}} = 1.7$. The distribution of $L$ is given as Gaussian. Let $f(L|R)$ and $f(L|\\bar{R})$ be the PDFs.\nThe Gaussian PDF is given by $f(x|\\mu, \\sigma) = \\frac{1}{\\sigma\\sqrt{2\\pi}}\\exp\\left(-\\frac{(x-\\mu)^2}{2\\sigma^2}\\right)$.\nFor $R$: $L \\sim \\mathcal{N}(\\mu_R, \\sigma)$ with $\\mu_R = 2.0$ mm and $\\sigma = 0.6$ mm.\nFor $\\bar{R}$: $L \\sim \\mathcal{N}(\\mu_{\\bar{R}}, \\sigma)$ with $\\mu_{\\bar{R}} = 0.8$ mm and $\\sigma = 0.6$ mm.\nThe Bayes factor for $E_2$ is:\n$$\\text{Bayes Factor}(E_2) = \\frac{f(L=1.7|R)}{f(L=1.7|\\bar{R})} = \\frac{\\frac{1}{\\sigma\\sqrt{2\\pi}}\\exp\\left(-\\frac{(1.7-\\mu_R)^2}{2\\sigma^2}\\right)}{\\frac{1}{\\sigma\\sqrt{2\\pi}}\\exp\\left(-\\frac{(1.7-\\mu_{\\bar{R}})^2}{2\\sigma^2}\\right)}$$\nThe normalization constant $\\frac{1}{\\sigma\\sqrt{2\\pi}}$ cancels out.\n$$\\text{Bayes Factor}(E_2) = \\frac{\\exp\\left(-\\frac{(1.7-2.0)^2}{2(0.6)^2}\\right)}{\\exp\\left(-\\frac{(1.7-0.8)^2}{2(0.6)^2}\\right)} = \\exp\\left( -\\frac{(-0.3)^2}{2(0.36)} + \\frac{(0.9)^2}{2(0.36)} \\right)$$\n$$\\text{Bayes Factor}(E_2) = \\exp\\left( \\frac{-(0.09) + (0.81)}{0.72} \\right) = \\exp\\left( \\frac{0.72}{0.72} \\right) = \\exp(1) = e$$\n\nNow, we combine these results to find the posterior odds:\n$$\\text{Posterior Odds} = \\left(\\frac{13}{7}\\right) \\times \\left(\\frac{9}{4}\\right) \\times e = \\frac{117}{28}e$$\n\nTo find the posterior probability $P_{\\text{post}} = P(R|E_1, E_2)$, we convert the odds back to a probability using the formula $P = \\frac{\\text{Odds}}{1 + \\text{Odds}}$.\n$$P_{\\text{post}} = \\frac{\\frac{117}{28}e}{1 + \\frac{117}{28}e} = \\frac{117e}{28 + 117e}$$\nNumerically, $\\frac{117}{28} \\approx 4.17857$ and $e \\approx 2.71828$.\nThe posterior odds are approximately $4.17857 \\times 2.71828 \\approx 11.3590$.\n$$P_{\\text{post}} \\approx \\frac{11.3590}{1 + 11.3590} = \\frac{11.3590}{12.3590} \\approx 0.91909$$\n\nFinally, we compute the decision index $I$:\n$$I = P_{\\text{post}} - T$$\n$$I \\approx 0.91909 - 0.15 = 0.76909$$\n\nRounding the result to four significant figures, as required by the problem statement, we get:\n$$I = 0.7691$$",
