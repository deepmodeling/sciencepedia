            "problem": "A clinician in dermatology and venereology is counseling a patient during sexual history-taking about Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) transmission risk per sexual act. The baseline per-act transmission probability for the specific exposure being discussed (without any prevention) is $p = 0.013$. The patient reports consistent condom use and daily oral preexposure prophylaxis (PrEP). For counseling, the clinician uses the following foundational definitions and assumptions from clinical epidemiology:\n\n- Definitions:\n  1. Efficacy $E$ of a preventive method is defined as the proportional reduction in risk relative to the baseline risk, so that the residual risk factor with that method alone is $(1 - E)$.\n  2. Absolute risk reduction (ARR) for one or more preventive methods is the absolute difference between the baseline risk and the risk under the preventive method(s).\n\n- Assumptions:\n  1. The biological mechanisms of protection from condoms and from PrEP act independently for a single act of exposure, so that residual risks combine multiplicatively.\n  2. The per-act efficacy of condoms is $E_{c} = 0.80$ and the per-act efficacy of PrEP is $E_{p} = 0.99$ under the patient’s reported consistent use.\n\nUsing only these definitions and assumptions, derive from first principles the analytic expression for the absolute risk reduction per act when both methods are used together, and then evaluate it numerically for the given $p$, $E_{c}$, and $E_{p}$.

            "solution": "The problem statement is first subjected to validation.\n\n### Step 1: Extract Givens\n- Baseline per-act transmission probability: $p = 0.013$\n- Definition of efficacy $E$: The proportional reduction in risk relative to the baseline risk. The residual risk factor is $(1 - E)$.\n- Definition of Absolute Risk Reduction (ARR): The absolute difference between the baseline risk and the risk under the preventive method(s).\n- Assumption 1: The protective mechanisms of condoms and Pre-exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP) are independent, meaning their residual risks combine multiplicatively.\n- Assumption 2: Efficacy of condoms, $E_{c} = 0.80$.\n- Assumption 2: Efficacy of PrEP, $E_{p} = 0.99$.\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\n- **Scientifically Grounded**: The problem is based on standard principles of clinical epidemiology, namely risk, efficacy, and absolute risk reduction. The values provided for baseline risk and preventive efficacies are consistent with data found in public health and medical literature. The assumption of independence for combined interventions is a standard modeling simplification used in this field. The problem is scientifically sound.\n- **Well-Posed**: The problem is clearly articulated. It provides all necessary definitions, assumptions, and numerical values required to derive a unique analytical expression and compute a final numerical answer.\n- **Objective**: The problem uses precise, quantitative language and is free from subjective or opinion-based statements.\n\nThe problem does not exhibit any of the listed flaws (e.g., scientific unsoundness, incompleteness, contradiction, ambiguity).\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. A complete solution will be provided.\n\n### Derivation of the Solution\nThe objective is to derive an expression for the absolute risk reduction (ARR) per act when both condoms and PrEP are used together, and then to calculate its numerical value.\n\nLet $p$ be the baseline per-act transmission probability. The value given is $p = 0.013$.\n\nThe efficacy $E$ of a preventive method is the proportional reduction in risk. The probability of transmission with a method of efficacy $E$ is $p' = p(1 - E)$. The term $(1 - E)$ is the residual risk factor.\n\nFor condoms, the efficacy is $E_c = 0.80$. The residual risk factor for condoms is:\n$$ R_c = 1 - E_c = 1 - 0.80 = 0.20 $$\nThe probability of transmission with condoms alone would be $p_c = p \\cdot R_c = p(1 - E_c)$.\n\nFor PrEP, the efficacy is $E_p = 0.99$. The residual risk factor for PrEP is:\n$$ R_p = 1 - E_p = 1 - 0.99 = 0.01 $$\nThe probability of transmission with PrEP alone would be $p_p = p \\cdot R_p = p(1 - E_p)$.\n\nThe problem states that the two methods act independently, so their residual risks combine multiplicatively. The combined residual risk factor, $R_{cp}$, when both condoms and PrEP are used is the product of the individual residual risk factors:\n$$ R_{cp} = R_c \\cdot R_p = (1 - E_c)(1 - E_p) $$\n\nThe probability of transmission per act when both methods are used, denoted as $p_{cp}$, is the baseline probability multiplied by this combined residual risk factor:\n$$ p_{cp} = p \\cdot R_{cp} = p(1 - E_c)(1 - E_p) $$\n\nThe absolute risk reduction (ARR) is defined as the absolute difference between the baseline risk and the risk under the preventive methods. For the combination of condoms and PrEP, this is:\n$$ \\text{ARR}_{cp} = p - p_{cp} $$\n\nSubstituting the expression for $p_{cp}$:\n$$ \\text{ARR}_{cp} = p - p(1 - E_c)(1 - E_p) $$\n\nThis can be factored to yield the general analytic expression for the absolute risk reduction:\n$$ \\text{ARR}_{cp} = p \\left[ 1 - (1 - E_c)(1 - E_p) \\right] $$\n\nThis is the requested analytic expression derived from first principles. Now, we evaluate this expression using the given numerical values: $p = 0.013$, $E_c = 0.80$, and $E_p = 0.99$.\n\nFirst, calculate the term in parentheses, which represents the combined residual risk factor:\n$$ (1 - E_c)(1 - E_p) = (1 - 0.80)(1 - 0.99) = (0.20)(0.01) = 0.002 $$\n\nNext, calculate the term in the square brackets, which represents the combined efficacy of the two methods:\n$$ 1 - (1 - E_c)(1 - E_p) = 1 - 0.002 = 0.998 $$\n\nFinally, calculate the absolute risk reduction by multiplying this combined efficacy by the baseline risk:\n$$ \\text{ARR}_{cp} = p \\left[ 1 - (1 - E_c)(1 - E_p) \\right] = 0.013 \\times 0.998 $$\n\nThe multiplication is performed as follows:\n$$ 0.013 \\times 0.998 = 0.012974 $$\n\nThus, the absolute risk reduction per act when both methods are used is $0.012974$. This is an exact decimal value as requested.",
