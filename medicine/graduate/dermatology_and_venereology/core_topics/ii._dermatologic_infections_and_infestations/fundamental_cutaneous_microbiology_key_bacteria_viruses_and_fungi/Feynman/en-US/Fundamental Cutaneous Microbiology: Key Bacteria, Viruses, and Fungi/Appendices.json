            "problem": "A dermatologist is modeling the pharmacodynamics of a topical antibacterial agent used for impetigo caused by Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus). The agent is a reversible, one-site inhibitor of an essential cytosolic enzyme. Assume the following foundational bases are valid: (i) the Law of Mass Action governs ligand-target binding at equilibrium; (ii) the fraction of targets bound by drug at extracellular concentration $C$ is determined solely by the dissociation constant $K_{d}$; (iii) at steady state, the number of active, unbound target molecules per cell is given by the product of the total copy number and the unbound fraction; and (iv) bacterial growth halts when the active, unbound target number falls to or below a critical threshold $N_{\\text{crit}}$ that is independent of drug concentration. The Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) is defined as the smallest extracellular concentration $C$ that meets this growth-halting condition at equilibrium.\n\nIn a baseline S. aureus strain, the total target copy number per cell is $N_{0} = 10^{4}$, the critical threshold is $N_{\\text{crit}} = 2 \\times 10^{3}$, and the dissociation constant is $K_{d,0} = 10$ nM. A variant strain emerges in the clinic with a twofold increase in target copy number (gene amplification) and a twofold increase in $K_{d}$ (reduced binding affinity).

Then, compute the new MIC for the variant strain in nanomolar (nM). Give your final answer as a single number without units. No rounding is required beyond exact arithmetic.",
            "solution": "### Derivation and Solution\n\nThe problem requires the derivation of a general expression for the Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) and its subsequent calculation for a specified variant strain.\n\nLet $T$ represent the unbound target enzyme, $D$ represent the drug (inhibitor), and $TD$ represent the target-drug complex. The reversible binding reaction is:\n$$ T + D \\rightleftharpoons TD $$\nAccording to the Law of Mass Action, the dissociation constant, $K_d$, is defined at equilibrium as:\n$$ K_d = \\frac{[T][D]}{[TD]} $$\nwhere brackets denote concentrations.\n\nThe problem states that the intracellular free drug concentration equilibrates with the extracellular concentration, $C$. Thus, we can set $[D] = C$.\n$$ K_d = \\frac{[T]C}{[TD]} $$\nThe total number of target molecules per cell is $N$. As the problem's quantities are given in numbers of molecules per cell, we can work with molecule counts instead of concentrations, since the volume is a common factor that cancels in ratios. Let $N_{T}$ be the number of unbound targets, $N_{TD}$ be the number of bound targets, and $N$ be the total number of targets.\n$$ N = N_{T} + N_{TD} $$\nThe dissociation constant relates these quantities in the same manner as concentrations:\n$$ K_d = \\frac{N_T \\cdot C}{N_{TD}} $$\nThis allows us to express $N_{TD}$ in terms of $N_T$:\n$$ N_{TD} = \\frac{N_T \\cdot C}{K_d} $$\nSubstituting this into the expression for the total number of targets:\n$$ N = N_T + \\frac{N_T \\cdot C}{K_d} = N_T \\left(1 + \\frac{C}{K_d}\\right) $$\nThe fraction of unbound targets, $f_{\\text{unbound}}$, is the ratio of unbound targets to total targets:\n$$ f_{\\text{unbound}} = \\frac{N_T}{N} = \\frac{N_T}{N_T \\left(1 + \\frac{C}{K_d}\\right)} = \\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{C}{K_d}} = \\frac{K_d}{K_d + C} $$\nAccording to the problem statement, the number of active, unbound target molecules, which we denote as $N_{\\text{active}}$, is the product of the total target copy number $N$ and the unbound fraction $f_{\\text{unbound}}$.\n$$ N_{\\text{active}} = N \\cdot f_{\\text{unbound}} = N \\left(\\frac{K_d}{K_d + C}\\right) $$\nGrowth halts when $N_{\\text{active}}$ falls to or below the critical threshold $N_{\\text{crit}}$. The MIC is the *smallest* concentration $C$ where this condition is met. This corresponds to the boundary case where equality holds. Let $C = \\text{MIC}$:\n$$ N_{\\text{crit}} = N \\left(\\frac{K_d}{K_d + \\text{MIC}}\\right) $$\nThe first task is to solve this equation for MIC as a function of $N$, $K_d$, and $N_{\\text{crit}}$.\n$$ \\frac{N_{\\text{crit}}}{N} = \\frac{K_d}{K_d + \\text{MIC}} $$\n$$ K_d + \\text{MIC} = K_d \\frac{N}{N_{\\text{crit}}} $$\n$$ \\text{MIC} = K_d \\frac{N}{N_{\\text{crit}}} - K_d $$\n$$ \\text{MIC} = K_d \\left(\\frac{N}{N_{\\text{crit}}} - 1\\right) $$\nThis is the general expression for the MIC based on the given model.\n\nThe second task is to compute the MIC for the variant strain. We are given the parameters for the baseline strain: $N_0 = 10^4$, $K_{d,0} = 10$ nM, and $N_{\\text{crit}} = 2 \\times 10^3$. The threshold $N_{\\text{crit}}$ is a property of the bacterium's essential physiology and is stated to be independent of the drug, so it remains unchanged for the variant.\n\nFor the variant strain:\nThe total target copy number is doubled:\n$$ N_{\\text{variant}} = 2 \\times N_0 = 2 \\times 10^4 $$\nThe dissociation constant is doubled:\n$$ K_{d, \\text{variant}} = 2 \\times K_{d,0} = 2 \\times (10 \\text{ nM}) = 20 \\text{ nM} $$\nThe critical threshold remains the same:\n$$ N_{\\text{crit}} = 2 \\times 10^3 $$\nNow, we substitute these values for the variant strain into the derived expression for MIC:\n$$ \\text{MIC}_{\\text{variant}} = K_{d, \\text{variant}} \\left(\\frac{N_{\\text{variant}}}{N_{\\text{crit}}} - 1\\right) $$\n$$ \\text{MIC}_{\\text{variant}} = (20 \\text{ nM}) \\left(\\frac{2 \\times 10^4}{2 \\times 10^3} - 1\\right) $$\nFirst, evaluate the ratio within the parentheses:\n$$ \\frac{2 \\times 10^4}{2 \\times 10^3} = \\frac{2}{2} \\times 10^{(4-3)} = 1 \\times 10^1 = 10 $$\nNow, substitute this back into the equation for $\\text{MIC}_{\\text{variant}}$:\n$$ \\text{MIC}_{\\text{variant}} = (20 \\text{ nM}) (10 - 1) $$\n$$ \\text{MIC}_{\\text{variant}} = (20 \\text{ nM}) (9) $$\n$$ \\text{MIC}_{\\text{variant}} = 180 \\text{ nM} $$\nThe new MIC for the variant strain is $180$ nM.
