The patient's occupation, exposure history (aquarium), a lesion on an extremity with sporotrichoid spread, and optimal growth at cooler temperatures are all well-established features of certain atypical mycobacterial infections. The Runyon classification, though somewhat outdated in the era of molecular diagnostics, remains a fundamental concept in clinical microbiology for NTM identification based on phenotypic traits (growth rate and pigmentation). The histopathological and staining results are also textbook findings. The problem is firmly rooted in established principles of dermatology, infectious diseases, and microbiology.\n-   **Well-Posed:** The problem is clearly stated and provides sufficient, consistent information to arrive at a single, logical conclusion. All data points (clinical, histological, and microbiological) are relevant and contribute to the differential diagnosis.\n-   **Objective:** The language is clinical and neutral, describing observations without subjective interpretation or bias.\n\nThe problem statement does not violate any of the invalidity criteria. It is a scientifically sound, well-posed, objective, and solvable problem within the specified domain.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is **valid**. A solution will be derived.\n\n**Solution Derivation**\n\nThe diagnosis can be established by systematically integrating the clinical, histopathological, and microbiological data.\n\n1.  **Clinical Context:** The patient is an immunocompetent adult working in an aquarium shop who sustained minor trauma while cleaning a saltwater tank. Following an incubation period of approximately $2$ weeks ($8$ weeks from trauma minus $6$ weeks of lesion history), he developed a primary lesion on his finger that spread proximally along lymphatic channels (sporotrichoid lymphocutaneous spread). This clinical syndrome, especially in the context of aquatic exposure, is highly suggestive of infection with *Mycobacterium marinum*, a condition commonly known as \"fish tank granuloma\" or \"swimming pool granuloma.\"\n\n2.  **Microbiological Analysis:** The culture results provide definitive clues to the identity of the causative organism.\n    -   **Growth Rate:** Growth appearing in $14$ days (i.e., $2$ weeks) classifies the organism as a **slow grower**. The Runyon classification system defines slow growers as those requiring more than $7$ days for visible colonies to appear on solid media. This finding immediately excludes Runyon Group $\\mathrm{IV}$ (rapid growers).\n    -   **Pigment Production (Chromogenicity):** The colonies are described as developing a bright yellow pigment *only after* exposure to light. This phenomenon defines the organism as a **photochromogen**.\n    -   **Temperature Requirement:** The organism grows at $30^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$ but fails to grow at $37^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$. This indicates a preference for cooler temperatures, which is characteristic of mycobacteria found in aquatic environments and correlates with their tendency to cause infections in the cooler, acral parts of the human body (hands, feet, elbows).\n\n3.  **Runyon Classification:** The Runyon system categorizes NTM based on growth rate and pigment production:\n    -   **Runyon Group I:** Slow-growing photochromogens (produce pigment only after light exposure).\n    -   **Runyon Group II:** Slow-growing scotochromogens (produce pigment in both light and dark).\n    -   **Runyon Group III:** Slow-growing nonchromogens (produce no significant pigment).\n    -   **Runyon Group IV:** Rapid growers (grow in less than $7$ days).\n\n    Based on the microbiological data (slow growth and photochromogenicity), the organism in this case belongs to **Runyon Group I**.\n\n4.  **Synthesizing Clinical and Microbiological Data:**\n    -   The clinical picture points strongly to *M. marinum*.\n    -   The microbiological findings—a slow-growing photochromogen that prefers $30^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$ for growth—are the defining laboratory characteristics of *M. marinum*.\n    -   Therefore, the pairing of *Mycobacterium marinum* and Runyon Group $\\mathrm{I}$ is the most logical diagnosis.\n\n**Option-by-Option Analysis**\n\nA. **Mycobacterium marinum — Runyon Group $\\mathrm{I}$ (photochromogen)**\n   -   *M. marinum* is the classic cause of fish tank granuloma, matching the clinical history (aquarium worker, saltwater tank exposure) and presentation (sporotrichoid spread from a distal extremity).\n   -   It is a slow grower, optimally at $30–32\\,^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$, and fails to grow at $37\\,^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$, which matches the culture data perfectly.\n   -   It is the archetypal photochromogen in the Runyon classification, belonging to Group $\\mathrm{I}$. All features in the problem statement are consistent with this choice.\n   -   **Verdict: Correct.**\n\nB. **Mycobacterium kansasii — Runyon Group $\\mathrm{I}$ (photochromogen)**\n   -   *M. kansasii* is indeed a photochromogen and thus belongs to Runyon Group $\\mathrm{I}$.\n   -   However, it primarily causes pulmonary disease and grows optimally at $37^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$. The problem explicitly states there was no growth at $37^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$, which rules out this species. The clinical context of aquatic exposure is also not typical for *M. kansasii*.\n   -   **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\nC. **Mycobacterium fortuitum — Runyon Group $\\mathrm{IV}$ (rapid grower, nonchromogen)**\n   -   *M. fortuitum* is a rapid grower (Runyon Group $\\mathrm{IV}$), meaning it grows in less than $7$ days. The organism in the case grew in $14$ days, making it a slow grower. This is a direct contradiction.\n   -   Furthermore, *M. fortuitum* is typically nonchromogenic, whereas the cultured organism was a photochromogen.\n   -   **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\nD. **Mycobacterium ulcerans — Runyon Group $\\mathrm{III}$ (nonchromogen)**\n   -   *M. ulcerans* grows optimally at cooler temperatures ($30–33\\,^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$), which is consistent with the problem. It causes extensive ulcerative skin disease (Buruli ulcer).\n   -   However, it is a nonchromogen (Runyon Group $\\mathrm{III}$), meaning it does not produce pigment. The organism in the case was a photochromogen. This is a direct contradiction.\n   -   *M. ulcerans* is also extremely slow-growing, typically requiring $6$–$8$ weeks or more for culture, which is significantly longer than the $14$ days reported here.\n   -   **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\nE. **Mycobacterium haemophilum — Runyon Group $\\mathrm{III}$ (nonchromogen)**\n   -   *M. haemophilum* also prefers cooler growth temperatures ($28–32\\,^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$).\n   -   However, it is classified as a nonchromogen (Runyon Group $\\mathrm{III}$), contradicting the finding of photochromogenicity.\n   -   Additionally, *M. haemophilum* is a fastidious organism requiring iron-containing supplements like hemin or ferric ammonium citrate for growth on L-J medium; the problem makes no mention of such required supplementation.\n   -   **Verdict: Incorrect.**",

            "problem": "A 26-year-old farmer from a rural, freshwater-endemic region presents with a large undermined ulcer on the posterior calf that has progressively enlarged over $6$ weeks but remains strikingly painless, with scant surrounding erythema. Histology shows coagulative necrosis with minimal neutrophilic infiltration. Culture and polymerase chain reaction identify Mycobacterium ulcerans producing the macrolide toxin mycolactone. You are asked to explain, from first principles, how specific molecular actions of mycolactone can simultaneously produce profound tissue necrosis and blunted nociception.\n\nUse the following foundational bases without presuming the target mechanisms:\n\n1. For excitable membranes, the steady-state membrane potential $V_m$ can be approximated by a weighted average of reversal potentials according to conductances, for example $V_m \\approx \\dfrac{g_K E_K + g_{Na} E_{Na} + g_L E_L}{g_K + g_{Na} + g_L}$, where $g_i$ are conductances and $E_i$ are reversal potentials for potassium, sodium, and leak, respectively. The Nernst potential for potassium is typically near $E_K \\approx -90\\,\\mathrm{mV}$, and nociceptor action potential threshold is often near $V_{th} \\approx -40\\,\\mathrm{mV}$. An increase in potassium leak conductance $g_K$ tends to hyperpolarize $V_m$ toward $E_K$, reducing the probability that a given depolarizing stimulus current $I_{\\text{stim}}$ can reach threshold.\n\n2. Chemotaxis of leukocytes toward an inflamed focus can be represented at the tissue scale by a flux $\\mathbf{J} = -\\chi \\nabla C$, where $\\chi$ is chemotactic sensitivity and $C$ is the local chemokine concentration. The chemokine concentration field is sustained by a secretion rate $s$ by resident and recruited cells and obeys a diffusion-secretion-decay balance at steady state, such that a reduction in $s$ flattens the gradient $\\nabla C$ and reduces $\\mathbf{J}$.\n\n3. The Central Dogma and the secretory pathway state that many cytokines, chemokines, adhesion molecules, and receptors are synthesized on ribosomes and require co-translational translocation into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) through the Sec61 translocon to enter the secretory pathway. Inhibition of the Sec61 channel blocks entry of nascent polypeptides into the ER lumen, leading to failure of secretion and surface expression, with downstream effects including immunosuppression and ER stress-mediated cytotoxicity.\n\nWhich option best derives the observed painless necrosis of Buruli ulcers from the molecular actions of mycolactone on nociceptive pathways and immune cell recruitment, consistent with the above principles?\n\nA. Mycolactone activates the Angiotensin II Type 2 Receptor (AT2R), increasing potassium leak channel conductance $g_K$ (e.g., two-pore domain channels such as TREK/TRAAK), driving $V_m$ toward $E_K$ and raising the stimulus needed to reach $V_{th}$, thereby blunting nociceptor firing. Concurrently, mycolactone inhibits the Sec61 translocon, reducing the secretion rate $s$ for pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, flattening $\\nabla C$ so that $\\mathbf{J}$ is small, and inducing ER stress cytotoxicity that produces necrosis with minimal leukocyte recruitment.\n\nB. Mycolactone directly blocks voltage-gated sodium channels (Nav1.7) in nociceptors, preventing action potentials, and also acts as a CXCR2 agonist that strongly elevates $s$, steepens $\\nabla C$, and greatly increases neutrophil flux $\\mathbf{J}$, resulting in intense inflammatory pain that is nonetheless absent due to sodium channel block.\n\nC. Mycolactone is a high-affinity agonist of Mu Opioid Receptors (MOR), producing analgesia, while enhancing Nuclear Factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-κB) signaling to increase $s$ for cytokines and chemokines, thereby escalating leukocyte recruitment $\\mathbf{J}$ and tissue necrosis; analgesia persists despite heightened inflammation because opioid activation overrides inflammatory nociception.\n\nD. Mycolactone reduces nerve growth factor (NGF) expression, causing progressive sensory fiber denervation that explains anesthesia over weeks, while simultaneously stimulating interferon-gamma (IFN-$\\gamma$) production and granuloma formation that accounts for necrosis without pain.\n\nE. Mycolactone exclusively impairs mitochondrial adenosine triphosphate (ATP) production in nociceptors, abolishing action potentials due to energy failure, but leaves Sec61-mediated protein secretion intact, so $s$ remains high and inflammation robust; the lesion therefore appears painless despite strong immune recruitment.\n\nSelect the single best option.",
            "solution": "The user wants me to validate the problem statement, and if valid, derive a solution by explaining the pathophysiology of Buruli ulcer based on three provided principles, and then evaluate the given options.\n\n### Problem Validation\n\n**Step 1: Extract Givens**\n\n*   **Clinical Presentation:** A $26$-year-old farmer from a rural, freshwater-endemic region presents with a large undermined ulcer on the posterior calf. The ulcer has progressively enlarged over $6$ weeks. It is strikingly painless, with scant surrounding erythema.\n*   **Histology:** Coagulative necrosis with minimal neutrophilic infiltration.\n*   **Etiology:** *Mycobacterium ulcerans* producing the macrolide toxin mycolactone.\n*   **Task:** Explain how mycolactone's molecular actions cause both profound tissue necrosis and blunted nociception.\n*   **Foundational Principle 1 (Excitable Membranes):** The steady-state membrane potential $V_m$ is given by $V_m \\approx \\dfrac{g_K E_K + g_{Na} E_{Na} + g_L E_L}{g_K + g_{Na} + g_L}$. Key values are the potassium Nernst potential, $E_K \\approx -90\\,\\mathrm{mV}$, and the nociceptor action potential threshold, $V_{th} \\approx -40\\,\\mathrm{mV}$. An increase in potassium conductance, $g_K$, hyperpolarizes $V_m$ toward $E_K$, reducing excitability.\n*   **Foundational Principle 2 (Chemotaxis):** Leukocyte flux is modeled as $\\mathbf{J} = -\\chi \\nabla C$, where $\\chi$ is chemotactic sensitivity and $C$ is chemokine concentration. A reduction in the chemokine secretion rate, $s$, flattens the gradient $\\nabla C$ and reduces the flux $\\mathbf{J}$.\n*   **Foundational Principle 3 (Secretory Pathway):** Many secreted proteins (cytokines, chemokines) and membrane proteins (receptors, adhesion molecules) must enter the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) via the Sec61 translocon. Inhibition of Sec61 blocks their secretion/expression, causing immunosuppression and ER stress-mediated cytotoxicity.\n\n**Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens**\n\n*   **Scientific Grounding:** The problem is based on the well-documented clinical entity of Buruli ulcer, caused by *Mycobacterium ulcerans*. The characteristic features described—a chronic, painless, necrotic ulcer with minimal inflammation—are accurate representations of the disease. The toxin mycolactone is indeed the primary virulence factor. The three foundational principles provided are all standard and correct tenets of neurophysiology, immunology, and cell biology, respectively. The chord conductance equation (Principle 1), the simplified chemotaxis model (Principle 2), and the function of the Sec61 translocon (Principle 3) are all scientifically sound concepts.\n*   **Well-Posedness:** The problem is well-posed. It asks for a mechanistic explanation that connects a specific toxin (mycolactone) to a specific set of clinical and histological findings (painless necrosis), using a provided set of fundamental principles as a framework. This structure guides toward a unique, logical solution.\n*   **Objectivity:** The problem statement is presented in objective, technical language, free from subjective or biased claims.\n*   **Conclusion of Validation:** The problem statement is scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and complete. It does not violate any of the invalidity criteria. Therefore, it is valid.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. I will proceed with the solution derivation and option evaluation.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe central task is to link the molecular actions of mycolactone to the two hallmark features of the ulcer: profound tissue necrosis and blunted nociception (painlessness), within the framework of the three given principles.\n\n1.  **Explaining Blunted Nociception (Painlessness):** The ulcer is \"strikingly painless.\" This implies a failure in the nociceptive pathway. Principle 1 provides a direct mechanism for reducing neuronal excitability. For a nociceptor to be less excitable, its resting membrane potential, $V_m$, must be moved further away from the action potential threshold, $V_{th} \\approx -40\\,\\mathrm{mV}$. Principle 1 states that an increase in potassium conductance, $g_K$, will hyperpolarize the membrane, driving $V_m$ towards the highly negative potassium reversal potential, $E_K \\approx -90\\,\\mathrm{mV}$. Therefore, a logical mechanism for mycolactone-induced analgesia is an action that increases $g_K$ in nociceptive sensory neurons.\n\n2.  **Explaining Necrosis with Minimal Inflammation:** The ulcer exhibits \"coagulative necrosis\" with \"scant surrounding erythema\" and \"minimal neutrophilic infiltration.\" This indicates severe cell death without a corresponding robust immune response.\n    *   **Minimal Inflammation:** Principle 2 relates immune cell recruitment (flux $\\mathbf{J}$) to the chemokine concentration gradient ($\\nabla C$), which is established by a secretion rate $s$. Minimal infiltration implies that $\\mathbf{J}$ is very small. This, in turn, suggests a flattened gradient, $\\nabla C \\approx 0$, which is caused by a severely reduced secretion rate, $s$, of chemokines and other pro-inflammatory signals from local cells.\n    *   **Necrosis and Minimal Inflammation Link:** Principle 3 provides a unifying mechanism. It states that inhibition of the Sec61 translocon blocks the entry of nascent proteins (like cytokines and chemokines) into the secretory pathway. Blockage of Sec61 would therefore drastically reduce the secretion rate $s$, explaining the minimal inflammation as per Principle 2. Furthermore, Principle 3 states that Sec61 inhibition leads to ER stress-mediated cytotoxicity. This provides a direct cause for the \"coagulative necrosis\" observed in the tissue.\n\n**Synthesis:** A single agent, mycolactone, must accomplish both tasks. The most parsimonious explanation is that mycolactone has two primary effects:\n*   It induces hyperpolarization in nociceptors by increasing potassium conductance ($g_K$), causing analgesia (consistent with Principle 1).\n*   It inhibits the Sec61 translocon, which simultaneously (a) blocks the secretion of pro-inflammatory mediators, leading to profound immunosuppression (consistent with Principle 2), and (b) induces ER stress, leading to widespread cell death and tissue necrosis (consistent with Principle 3).\n\nThis synthesized model fully accounts for the clinical and histological picture using the provided foundational bases.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. Mycolactone activates the Angiotensin II Type 2 Receptor (AT2R), increasing potassium leak channel conductance $g_K$ (e.g., two-pore domain channels such as TREK/TRAAK), driving $V_m$ toward $E_K$ and raising the stimulus needed to reach $V_{th}$, thereby blunting nociceptor firing. Concurrently, mycolactone inhibits the Sec61 translocon, reducing the secretion rate $s$ for pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, flattening $\\nabla C$ so that $\\mathbf{J}$ is small, and inducing ER stress cytotoxicity that produces necrosis with minimal leukocyte recruitment.**\n\n*   **Analysis:** This option perfectly aligns with the derived synthesis. It proposes a specific mechanism for increased $g_K$ (AT2R activation) consistent with Principle 1 to explain the analgesia. It then correctly identifies Sec61 inhibition as the cause for both the reduced inflammatory cell flux $\\mathbf{J}$ (via reduced $s$ and $\\nabla C$, per Principle 2) and the ER stress-induced necrosis (per Principle 3). This option cohesively links all three principles to the actions of mycolactone and the observed pathology.\n*   **Verdict:** Correct.\n\n**B. Mycolactone directly blocks voltage-gated sodium channels (Nav1.7) in nociceptors, preventing action potentials, and also acts as a CXCR2 agonist that strongly elevates $s$, steepens $\\nabla C$, and greatly increases neutrophil flux $\\mathbf{J}$, resulting in intense inflammatory pain that is nonetheless absent due to sodium channel block.**\n\n*   **Analysis:** This option is incorrect for two main reasons. First, it proposes a pro-inflammatory action (CXCR2 agonism, increased $s$ and $\\mathbf{J}$) that is directly contradicted by the clinical evidence of \"scant erythema\" and histological evidence of \"minimal neutrophilic infiltration.\" Second, while blocking Nav1.7 channels causes analgesia, the problem guides us toward a mechanism involving resting membrane potential and potassium conductance via Principle 1. But the primary flaw is the gross mischaracterization of the local immune response.\n*   **Verdict:** Incorrect.\n\n**C. Mycolactone is a high-affinity agonist of Mu Opioid Receptors (MOR), producing analgesia, while enhancing Nuclear Factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-κB) signaling to increase $s$ for cytokines and chemokines, thereby escalating leukocyte recruitment $\\mathbf{J}$ and tissue necrosis; analgesia persists despite heightened inflammation because opioid activation overrides inflammatory nociception.**\n\n*   **Analysis:** This option suffers from the same fundamental flaw as option B. It suggests a mechanism that *enhances* inflammation (NF-κB activation, increased $s$ and $\\mathbf{J}$), which is contrary to the defining pauci-inflammatory nature of a Buruli ulcer lesion.\n*   **Verdict:** Incorrect.\n\n**D. Mycolactone reduces nerve growth factor (NGF) expression, causing progressive sensory fiber denervation that explains anesthesia over weeks, while simultaneously stimulating interferon-gamma (IFN-$\\gamma$) production and granuloma formation that accounts for necrosis without pain.**\n\n*   **Analysis:** This option is incorrect because its proposed immune mechanism is factually wrong for Buruli ulcer. Granuloma formation is characteristic of diseases like tuberculosis, where the immune system walls off the pathogen. Buruli ulcer is defined by a *lack* of such an organized immune response and instead features widespread, non-contained necrosis. The pathology described is inconsistent with the disease.\n*   **Verdict:** Incorrect.\n\n**E. Mycolactone exclusively impairs mitochondrial adenosine triphosphate (ATP) production in nociceptors, abolishing action potentials due to energy failure, but leaves Sec61-mediated protein secretion intact, so $s$ remains high and inflammation robust; the lesion therefore appears painless despite strong immune recruitment.**\n\n*   **Analysis:** This option explicitly and incorrectly states that Sec61-mediated secretion is intact and that inflammation is robust. This contradicts both the known primary mechanism of mycolactone (which is Sec61 inhibition) and the clinical/histological findings of minimal inflammation. It directly denies the relevance of Principles 2 and 3.\n*   **Verdict:** Incorrect.",

Thus, we can express the components of reference clearance in terms of $CL_{\\text{ref}}$:\n$$ CL_{r,\\text{ref}} = f_r \\cdot CL_{\\text{ref}} $$\n$$ CL_{nr,\\text{ref}} = (1 - f_r) \\cdot CL_{\\text{ref}} $$\nNow, we formulate the clearance for the patient with renal impairment, $CL_{\\text{adj}}$.\n$$ CL_{\\text{adj}} = CL_{r,\\text{adj}} + CL_{nr,\\text{adj}} $$\nThe problem states that nonrenal clearance is unchanged by renal dysfunction, so $CL_{nr,\\text{adj}} = CL_{nr,\\text{ref}}$.\nIt also states that renal clearance scales in proportion to creatinine clearance (CrCl). We define a scaling factor $\\theta$ as the ratio of the patient's CrCl to the reference CrCl:\n$$ \\theta = \\frac{\\text{CrCl}_{\\text{patient}}}{\\text{CrCl}_{\\text{reference}}} $$\nTherefore, the patient's renal clearance is:\n$$ CL_{r,\\text{adj}} = CL_{r,\\text{ref}} \\cdot \\theta $$\nSubstituting the expressions for $CL_{r,\\text{ref}}$ and $CL_{nr,\\text{ref}}$ into the equation for $CL_{\\text{adj}}$:\n$$ CL_{\\text{adj}} = (f_r \\cdot CL_{\\text{ref}}) \\cdot \\theta + (1 - f_r) \\cdot CL_{\\text{ref}} $$\nFactoring out $CL_{\\text{ref}}$ yields:\n$$ CL_{\\text{adj}} = CL_{\\text{ref}} \\cdot [f_r \\cdot \\theta + (1 - f_r)] $$\nNow we can compute the required clearance ratio:\n$$ \\frac{CL_{\\text{adj}}}{CL_{\\text{ref}}} = f_r \\cdot \\theta + (1 - f_r) $$\nThis ratio represents the patient's remaining total drug clearance as a fraction of normal clearance.\n\nLet's calculate the numerical values.\nThe reference dose, $\\text{Dose}_{\\text{ref}}$, is based on the patient's weight. The standard regimen is $15\\,\\mathrm{mg/kg}$ and the patient's weight is $62\\,\\mathrm{kg}$.\n$$ \\text{Dose}_{\\text{ref}} = 15\\,\\mathrm{mg/kg} \\times 62\\,\\mathrm{kg} = 930\\,\\mathrm{mg} $$\nThe renal function scaling factor, $\\theta$, is calculated from the given CrCl values:\n$$ \\theta = \\frac{25\\,\\mathrm{mL/min}}{100\\,\\mathrm{mL/min}} = 0.25 $$\nThe fraction of renal elimination, $f_r$, is given as $0.80$.\n\nWe can now calculate the clearance ratio:\n$$ \\frac{CL_{\\text{adj}}}{CL_{\\text{ref}}} = (0.80 \\cdot 0.25) + (1 - 0.80) = 0.20 + 0.20 = 0.40 $$\nThis means the patient's total ethambutol clearance is $40\\%$ of a person with normal renal function.\n\nFinally, we calculate the adjusted dose, $\\text{Dose}_{\\text{adj}}$:\n$$ \\text{Dose}_{\\text{adj}} = \\text{Dose}_{\\text{ref}} \\cdot \\frac{CL_{\\text{adj}}}{CL_{\\text{ref}}} $$\n$$ \\text{Dose}_{\\text{adj}} = 930\\,\\mathrm{mg} \\times 0.40 = 372\\,\\mathrm{mg} $$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to three significant figures. The calculated value $372$ already has three significant figures.\nThe adjusted once-daily dose for this patient is $372\\,\\mathrm{mg}$.",
