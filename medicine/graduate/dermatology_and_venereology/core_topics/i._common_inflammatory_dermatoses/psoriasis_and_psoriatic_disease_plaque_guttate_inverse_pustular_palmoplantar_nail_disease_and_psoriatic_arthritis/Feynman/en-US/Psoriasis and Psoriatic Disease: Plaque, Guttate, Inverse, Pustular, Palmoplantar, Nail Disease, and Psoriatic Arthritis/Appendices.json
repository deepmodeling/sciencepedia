            "introduction": "Understanding the pathophysiology of psoriasis begins at the cellular level. This exercise invites you to model the psoriatic epidermis as a dynamic system, connecting the increased mitotic rate of keratinocytes directly to the accelerated turnover time that underlies the characteristic scaling (hyperkeratosis) of psoriatic plaques . By deriving this relationship from first principles, you will gain a deeper, quantitative appreciation for how cellular dysregulation manifests as clinical disease.",

            "problem": "In human epidermal homeostasis, keratinocytes produced by basal layer mitoses enter a differentiating pipeline and ultimately desquamate from the surface. Consider a stationary, steady-state epidermal system in which the number of keratinocytes within the viable-to-corneocyte differentiating compartment is temporally constant. Normal epidermal turnover time is approximately $28$ days, meaning a typical keratinocyte requires $28$ days from its basal exit into differentiation to surface shedding under normal conditions. In a psoriatic plaque, the mitotic rate of basal keratinocytes increases by a factor of $3$ compared to normal, with the fraction of mitoses yielding differentiating progeny unchanged. Assume an early time frame in which the differentiating compartment size has not yet remodeled.\n\nStarting from conservation of cell number in a steady-flow system, and without invoking any pre-stated shortcut formulas, derive how the mean turnover time relates to the production flux and the size of the differentiating pool, then compute the theoretical new turnover time under the above assumptions. Round your final numerical answer to three significant figures and express it in days. Briefly explain, based on your derivation, the implications of this shortened turnover time for scale formation in psoriatic plaques when the desquamation machinery cannot proportionally increase its throughput.\n\nOnly the numerical turnover time is to be provided as the final answer.",
            "solution": "We model the epidermis as a steady-flow system of keratinocytes. Let $N$ denote the mean number of cells in the differentiating compartment spanning from basal exit to surface shedding. Let $J$ denote the steady inflow of differentiating cells per unit time, which at steady state equals the outflow by desquamation. Let $T$ denote the mean residence (turnover) time from entry into the differentiating compartment to exit at the surface.\n\nWe begin from conservation of cell number in steady state. Over an interval of duration $\\Delta t$ that is long compared to microscopic events but short compared to system remodeling, the number of cells entering the compartment is $J \\Delta t$, and the number exiting is also $J \\Delta t$. The average number of cells present in the compartment is the time average of occupancy, which for a renewal process equals the inflow rate multiplied by the mean sojourn time. This statement can be derived by considering the age distribution of cells. Let $a \\in [0,\\infty)$ denote the age (time since entry into the differentiating compartment). Let $p(a)$ denote the probability density of exit at age $a$, with $\\int_{0}^{\\infty} p(a) \\,\\mathrm{d}a = 1$ and mean $\\int_{0}^{\\infty} a \\, p(a) \\,\\mathrm{d}a = T$. In steady state with constant inflow $J$, the density of cells with ages in $[a,a+\\mathrm{d}a]$ equals $J$ times the probability that a cell survives to age $a$ times $\\mathrm{d}a$, namely $J S(a)\\,\\mathrm{d}a$, where $S(a) = 1 - \\int_{0}^{a} p(u)\\,\\mathrm{d}u$ is the survival function. The total number in the compartment is then\n$$\nN \\;=\\; \\int_{0}^{\\infty} J S(a)\\,\\mathrm{d}a.\n$$\nIntegrating by parts using $S(a) = \\int_{a}^{\\infty} p(u)\\,\\mathrm{d}u$ yields\n$$\nN \\;=\\; J \\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\left( \\int_{a}^{\\infty} p(u)\\,\\mathrm{d}u \\right) \\mathrm{d}a \\;=\\; J \\int_{0}^{\\infty} u \\, p(u)\\,\\mathrm{d}u \\;=\\; J T.\n$$\nThus, at steady state,\n$$\nN \\;=\\; J T.\n$$\n\nLet the normal state be denoted by subscript $0$: $N_{0}$, $J_{0}$, $T_{0}$. We are given $T_{0} = 28$ days. In the psoriatic state immediately after the mitotic rate increase and before compartment remodeling, we assume $N$ has not changed from its normal value, i.e., $N_{1} = N_{0}$. The basal mitotic rate increases by a factor of $3$, and the fraction of mitoses producing differentiating progeny is unchanged, so the flux into the differentiating compartment scales by the same factor, giving $J_{1} = 3 J_{0}$.\n\nApplying $N = J T$ to both states:\n$$\nN_{0} = J_{0} T_{0}, \\quad N_{1} = J_{1} T_{1}.\n$$\nWith $N_{1} = N_{0}$ and $J_{1} = 3 J_{0}$, we have\n$$\nJ_{0} T_{0} \\;=\\; 3 J_{0} T_{1} \\;\\;\\Rightarrow\\;\\; T_{1} \\;=\\; \\frac{T_{0}}{3} \\;=\\; \\frac{28}{3} \\text{ days}.\n$$\nNumerically,\n$$\nT_{1} \\;=\\; 9.333\\ldots \\text{ days}.\n$$\nRounding to three significant figures yields $9.33$ days.\n\nImplications for scale formation: Because $T$ shortens, keratinocytes traverse the differentiation program more rapidly. If the desquamation machinery (for example, corneodesmosome degradation, protease activation, and stratum corneum lipid processing) cannot increase its throughput in proportion to the $3$-fold higher inflow, then the outflow remains closer to $J_{0}$ while inflow is $3 J_{0}$. The net accumulation rate within the cornified layers becomes approximately $(3 J_{0} - J_{0}) = 2 J_{0}$, leading to progressive thickening of the stratum corneum (hyperkeratosis) and visible scale. Furthermore, the abbreviated residence time $T_{1}$ reduces the time available for complete terminal differentiation, favoring retention of nuclei in the stratum corneum (parakeratosis), a histologic hallmark of psoriatic scale. These consequences emerge directly from the steady-flow relation $N = J T$ and the mismatch between production flux and desquamation capacity.",

The Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) is a fundamental tool used worldwide in both clinical trials and practice to quantify disease burden . This practice problem provides a direct opportunity to apply the PASI formula, ensuring you are proficient in calculating this key metric from its core components: erythema, induration, scaling, and area of involvement.",
            "id": "4488391",
            "problem": "A central quantitative tool in assessing the burden of psoriasis is the Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI), which partitions the body into four regions (head, upper limbs, trunk, and lower limbs) and combines, for each region, three severity components—erythema, induration, and scaling—with an area involvement score, weighted by the region’s proportion of total body surface area. The region weights are $w_H=0.1$ for head, $w_U=0.2$ for upper limbs, $w_T=0.3$ for trunk, and $w_L=0.4$ for lower limbs. Each severity component is graded on an integer scale from $0$ to $4$, and the area involvement for each region is graded on an integer scale from $0$ to $6$.\n\nConsider a patient with uniform severity across all regions: erythema $E=3$, induration $I=2$, and scaling $S=3$. The area involvement scores for the regions are $A_H=1$ for head, $A_U=3$ for upper limbs, $A_T=2$ for trunk, and $A_L=4$ for lower limbs. Using the standard definition of the PASI, compute the PASI score for this patient. Express your final answer as an exact value (no rounding) and note that the PASI is unitless.",
            "solution": "The PASI is computed by summing the scores from four distinct body regions: head ($H$), upper limbs ($U$), trunk ($T$), and lower limbs ($L$).

            "problem": "A $52$-year-old individual with chronic plaque psoriasis and nail disease is initiated on oral methotrexate for systemic control after inadequate response to topical therapy and phototherapy. The patient weighs $70$ kg and has the following comorbidities and lifestyle factors: body mass index $32$ kg/m$^2$, type $2$ diabetes mellitus, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), and consumption of approximately $14$ standard alcoholic drinks per week. Baseline laboratory values show transaminases at the upper limit of normal with preserved synthetic function; renal function is normal. No other hepatotoxic drugs are used.\n\nMethotrexate is started at $15$ mg once weekly without a loading dose. The clinic standard folate supplementation protocol is folic acid $1$ mg daily except on the day methotrexate is taken. The clinic’s laboratory monitoring protocol specifies obtaining a Complete Blood Count (CBC) and a Comprehensive Metabolic Panel (CMP) at baseline (week $0$), every $2$ weeks through week $12$ inclusive (weeks $2,4,6,8,10,12$), then every $4$ weeks at weeks $16,20,24$, and thereafter every $8$ weeks (weeks $32,40,48,56,64,72,80,88,96,104,\\dots$) while the dose is stable. The clinic uses a cumulative-dose threshold approach to trigger noninvasive hepatic fibrosis assessment: in high-risk patients (defined by features such as obesity, NAFLD, diabetes mellitus, or significant alcohol intake), the threshold is a cumulative methotrexate dose of $1.5$ g; in low-risk patients, it is $3.5$ g.\n\nStarting from fundamental pharmacology and risk stratification principles for methotrexate in psoriasis, and using only the information given:\n- Compute the weekly methotrexate dose per kilogram.\n- Determine the weekly folic acid intake from the specified supplementation regimen.\n- Classify the patient’s hepatotoxicity risk category based on the provided modifiers and, using the clinic’s cumulative-dose threshold policy, compute the week at which the noninvasive hepatic fibrosis assessment would be triggered at the current methotrexate dose.\n- Based on the monitoring schedule and the computed trigger week, count the total number of combined CBC-CMP panels that will be obtained from baseline up to and including the last scheduled monitoring time point that occurs before the hepatic assessment is triggered.\n\nProvide as your final answer only the total number of combined CBC-CMP panels to be obtained before the hepatic assessment is triggered. Express your final answer as an integer without units. No rounding instruction is necessary beyond exact counting.",
            "solution": "The full solution is derived through the following steps, as requested by the problem statement.\n\nFirst, the weekly methotrexate dose per kilogram of body weight is computed.\nThe patient's weight is given as $W = 70 \\text{ kg}$.\nThe weekly oral methotrexate dose is $D_{weekly} = 15 \\text{ mg}$.\nThe dose per kilogram, $d_{kg}$, is the ratio of the total weekly dose to the patient's weight:\n$$d_{kg} = \\frac{D_{weekly}}{W} = \\frac{15 \\text{ mg}}{70 \\text{ kg}} = \\frac{3}{14} \\frac{\\text{mg}}{\\text{kg}}$$\nThis is approximately $0.214 \\text{ mg/kg}$ per week.\n\nSecond, the total weekly folic acid intake is determined from the supplementation regimen.\nThe protocol specifies folic acid at a dose of $1 \\text{ mg}$ daily, except on the day methotrexate is taken. Since methotrexate is administered once weekly, folic acid is taken on $7 - 1 = 6$ days of the week.\nThe total weekly folic acid intake, $F_{weekly}$, is:\n$$F_{weekly} = 1 \\frac{\\text{mg}}{\\text{day}} \\times 6 \\text{ days} = 6 \\text{ mg}$$\n\nThird, the patient's hepatotoxicity risk is classified, and the time to trigger hepatic fibrosis assessment is calculated.\nThe patient has a body mass index (BMI) of $32 \\text{ kg/m}^2$ (obesity), type $2$ diabetes mellitus, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), and consumes approximately $14$ standard alcoholic drinks per week. According to the provided criteria, these are features of a high-risk patient.\nFor high-risk patients, the clinic's policy triggers a noninvasive hepatic fibrosis assessment when the cumulative methotrexate dose reaches a threshold of $D_{cumulative\\_threshold} = 1.5 \\text{ g}$.\nWe must convert this threshold to milligrams to match the weekly dosage units:\n$$D_{cumulative\\_threshold} = 1.5 \\text{ g} \\times \\frac{1000 \\text{ mg}}{1 \\text{ g}} = 1500 \\text{ mg}$$\nThe patient receives a stable weekly dose of $D_{weekly} = 15 \\text{ mg}$. The number of weeks, $W_{trigger}$, required to reach the cumulative dose threshold is:\n$$W_{trigger} = \\frac{D_{cumulative\\_threshold}}{D_{weekly}} = \\frac{1500 \\text{ mg}}{15 \\text{ mg/week}} = 100 \\text{ weeks}$$\nThus, the hepatic assessment is triggered at week $100$.\n\nFourth, the total number of combined Complete Blood Count (CBC) and Comprehensive Metabolic Panel (CMP) sets is counted based on the monitoring schedule, up to the trigger week. The assessment is triggered at week $100$, so we must count all scheduled monitoring events at weeks $t < 100$.\n\nThe monitoring schedule is as follows:\n1.  Baseline: A panel is obtained at week $0$. This is $1$ panel.\n2.  Every $2$ weeks through week $12$: Panels are obtained at weeks $2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12$. The number of panels in this period is $\\frac{12 - 0}{2} = 6$.\n3.  Every $4$ weeks from week $16$ to week $24$: Panels are obtained at weeks $16, 20, 24$. This is $3$ panels.\n4.  Every $8$ weeks thereafter: Panels are obtained at weeks $32, 40, 48, \\dots$. We need to count the number of these time points that are less than week $100$. The series of these weeks can be represented as $t_k = 24 + 8k$ for $k = 1, 2, 3, \\dots$. We find the values of $k$ for which $t_k < 100$:\n    $$24 + 8k < 100$$\n    $$8k < 100 - 24$$\n    $$8k < 76$$\n    $$k < \\frac{76}{8} = 9.5$$\n    Since $k$ must be an integer, the possible values for $k$ are $1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9$. This corresponds to $9$ monitoring time points (weeks $32, 40, 48, 56, 64, 72, 80, 88, 96$).\n\nThe total number of panels, $N_{panels}$, is the sum of the counts from each interval:\n$$N_{panels} = (\\text{Baseline}) + (\\text{q2wk interval}) + (\\text{q4wk interval}) + (\\text{q8wk interval})$$\n$$N_{panels} = 1 + 6 + 3 + 9 = 19$$\n\nTherefore, a total of $19$ combined CBC-CMP panels will be obtained from baseline up to and including the last scheduled monitoring time point before the hepatic assessment is triggered. The last included monitoring point is at week $96$.",
