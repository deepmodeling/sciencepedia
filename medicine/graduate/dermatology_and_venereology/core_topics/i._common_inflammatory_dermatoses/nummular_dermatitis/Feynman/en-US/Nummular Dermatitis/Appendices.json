            "problem": "A middle-aged patient presents with coin-shaped, intensely pruritic plaques on the extensor surfaces during winter. The leading differential diagnoses are nummular dermatitis and dermatophyte infection of the body (tinea corporis). A potassium hydroxide (KOH) preparation (potassium hydroxide (KOH) microscopy for fungal elements) is performed. For suspected dermatophyte infections in this clinical setting, the KOH test has sensitivity $0.75$ and specificity $0.90$. Based on clinical assessment, the clinician estimates a pretest probability of tinea of $0.30$. The KOH result returns negative for hyphae.\n\nUsing only the formal definitions of sensitivity and specificity and the laws of conditional probability, determine the post-test probability (posterior probability) that the patient has tinea given the negative KOH result.

Using the fundamental geometric definition of a circle’s area and standard unit conversion, compute the total involved area contributed by these plaques. Express your final answer in square meters ($\\mathrm{m}^2$) and round your answer to four significant figures.",
            "solution": "The problem statement is first subjected to validation.\n\n**Step 1: Extract Givens**\n- Number of plaques, $N$: $10$\n- Shape of plaques: Approximated by a circle.\n- Diameter of each plaque, $d$: $5\\,\\mathrm{cm}$\n- Total Body Surface Area (BSA), $A_{\\text{BSA}}$: $1.8\\,\\mathrm{m}^2$\n- Requirement: Compute the total involved area of the plaques.\n- Required units for the final answer: square meters ($\\mathrm{m}^2$).\n- Required precision: Round to four significant figures.\n\n**Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens**\nThe problem is scientifically grounded, as nummular dermatitis lesions are indeed coin-shaped, and quantifying lesion area is a standard practice in dermatology. The provided physical dimensions ($d=5\\,\\mathrm{cm}$, $A_{\\text{BSA}}=1.8\\,\\mathrm{m}^2$) are realistic for a clinical scenario. The problem is well-posed, objective, and self-contained. It provides all necessary information (number of lesions, shape, diameter) to compute a unique area. The inclusion of the patient's total BSA is contextual information relevant to the clinical setting of expressing lesion burden as a percentage, but it is not required for the specific question asked, which is to compute the absolute area in square meters. There are no contradictions, ambiguities, or violations of scientific principles.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is deemed valid. A solution will be formulated.\n\nThe task is to calculate the total area of $N=10$ circular plaques, each with a diameter of $d=5\\,\\mathrm{cm}$. The final result must be in square meters and rounded to four significant figures.\n\nFirst, we determine the area of a single plaque. The area of a circle, $A_{\\text{single}}$, is given by the formula:\n$$A_{\\text{single}} = \\pi r^2$$\nwhere $r$ is the radius of the circle. The radius is half of the diameter, $d$.\n$$r = \\frac{d}{2} = \\frac{5\\,\\mathrm{cm}}{2} = 2.5\\,\\mathrm{cm}$$\n\nThe final answer must be in square meters ($\\mathrm{m}^2$), so we must convert the radius from centimeters ($\\mathrm{cm}$) to meters ($\\mathrm{m}$). The conversion factor is $1\\,\\mathrm{m} = 100\\,\\mathrm{cm}$, or $1\\,\\mathrm{cm} = 10^{-2}\\,\\mathrm{m}$.\n$$r = 2.5\\,\\mathrm{cm} = 2.5 \\times 10^{-2}\\,\\mathrm{m}$$\n\nNow, we can calculate the area of a single plaque in square meters.\n$$A_{\\text{single}} = \\pi r^2 = \\pi \\left(2.5 \\times 10^{-2}\\,\\mathrm{m}\\right)^2$$\n$$A_{\\text{single}} = \\pi \\left(2.5^2 \\times (10^{-2})^2\\right)\\,\\mathrm{m}^2$$\n$$A_{\\text{single}} = \\pi \\left(6.25 \\times 10^{-4}\\right)\\,\\mathrm{m}^2 = 6.25\\pi \\times 10^{-4}\\,\\mathrm{m}^2$$\n\nThe total involved area, $A_{\\text{total}}$, is the area of a single plaque multiplied by the total number of plaques, $N=10$.\n$$A_{\\text{total}} = N \\times A_{\\text{single}}$$\n$$A_{\\text{total}} = 10 \\times \\left(6.25\\pi \\times 10^{-4}\\,\\mathrm{m}^2\\right)$$\n$$A_{\\text{total}} = 62.5\\pi \\times 10^{-4}\\,\\mathrm{m}^2$$\nTo express this in standard scientific notation, we write:\n$$A_{\\text{total}} = 6.25\\pi \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{m}^2$$\n\nFinally, we compute the numerical value and round it to four significant figures as required. Using the value of $\\pi \\approx 3.14159265...$:\n$$A_{\\text{total}} \\approx (6.25 \\times 3.14159265...) \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{m}^2$$\n$$A_{\\text{total}} \\approx 19.634954... \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{m}^2$$\n$$A_{\\text{total}} \\approx 0.019634954...\\,\\mathrm{m}^2$$\n\nTo round to four significant figures, we identify the first four non-zero digits, which are $1$, $9$, $6$, and $3$. The fifth significant digit is $4$. Since $4  5$, we do not round up the last digit.\n$$A_{\\text{total}} \\approx 0.01963\\,\\mathrm{m}^2$$\nIn standard scientific notation, this is $1.963 \\times 10^{-2}\\,\\mathrm{m}^2$.",
