In the case of Pityriasis Rosea, the most critical mimic to exclude is secondary syphilis. This exercise provides hands-on practice applying Bayes' theorem to a common clinical scenario, allowing you to quantify how a negative test result should change your diagnostic suspicion . Mastering this quantitative approach to clinical reasoning is essential for interpreting diagnostic tests and making evidence-based decisions under uncertainty.",

            "problem": "A clinician evaluates a patient with a truncal exanthem suggestive of pityriasis rosea, including a herald patch and a so-called Christmas-tree distribution. Because secondary syphilis is a critical alternative diagnosis, the clinician estimates the pretest probability of active syphilis as $0.10$ based on history and examination. A Rapid Plasma Reagin (RPR) test is performed and returns negative. Assume the RPR has sensitivity $0.86$ and specificity $0.98$ for active syphilis in this clinical context. Using only Bayes’ theorem and the standard definitions of sensitivity and specificity as foundational principles, compute the post-test probability of active syphilis given a negative RPR result. Express your final answer as a single reduced fraction with no units. Do not use a percent sign.",
            "solution": "The problem is evaluated as valid. It is scientifically grounded in the principles of clinical epidemiology and biostatistics, is well-posed with all necessary information provided, and is stated using objective, formal language. The problem requires a direct application of Bayes' theorem, a fundamental concept in probability theory, to a realistic clinical scenario.\n\nLet $S$ be the event that the patient has active syphilis. Let $S^c$ be the complementary event that the patient does not have active syphilis.\nLet $T^{-}$ be the event of a negative Rapid Plasma Reagin (RPR) test result, and $T^{+}$ be the event of a positive test result.\n\nThe problem provides the following information, which we translate into probabilistic terms:\n1.  The pretest probability of active syphilis is given as $P(S) = 0.10$.\n2.  The sensitivity of the RPR test is the probability of a positive test given that the disease is present: $P(T^{+} | S) = 0.86$.\n3.  The specificity of the RPR test is the probability of a negative test given that the disease is absent: $P(T^{-} | S^c) = 0.98$.\n\nFrom the pretest probability $P(S)$, we can determine the probability that the patient does not have active syphilis:\n$$P(S^c) = 1 - P(S) = 1 - 0.10 = 0.90$$\n\nThe objective is to compute the post-test probability of active syphilis given a negative test result, which is denoted as $P(S | T^{-})$. We will use Bayes' theorem, which is stated as:\n$$P(S | T^{-}) = \\frac{P(T^{-} | S) \\cdot P(S)}{P(T^{-})}$$\n\nThe denominator, $P(T^{-})$, represents the total probability of obtaining a negative test result. This can be calculated using the law of total probability, which involves summing the probabilities of a negative result over all possible disease states (present or absent):\n$$P(T^{-}) = P(T^{-} | S) \\cdot P(S) + P(T^{-} | S^c) \\cdot P(S^c)$$\n\nTo use this formula, we first need to determine $P(T^{-} | S)$, which is the probability of a negative test result given that the patient has syphilis. This quantity is also known as the false negative rate. It is the complement of the sensitivity, $P(T^{+} | S)$, since for a patient with the disease, the test can only be positive or negative.\n$$P(T^{-} | S) = 1 - P(T^{+} | S) = 1 - 0.86 = 0.14$$\n\nNow we have all the components to calculate the total probability of a negative test, $P(T^{-})$:\nThe first term, $P(T^{-} | S) \\cdot P(S)$, is the probability of a false negative result:\n$$P(T^{-} | S) \\cdot P(S) = 0.14 \\times 0.10 = 0.014$$\nThe second term, $P(T^{-} | S^c) \\cdot P(S^c)$, is the probability of a true negative result:\n$$P(T^{-} | S^c) \\cdot P(S^c) = 0.98 \\times 0.90 = 0.882$$\nThe total probability of a negative test is the sum of these two terms:\n$$P(T^{-}) = 0.014 + 0.882 = 0.896$$\n\nFinally, we substitute the numerator, $P(T^{-} | S) \\cdot P(S) = 0.014$, and the calculated denominator, $P(T^{-}) = 0.896$, back into Bayes' theorem:\n$$P(S | T^{-}) = \\frac{0.014}{0.896}$$\n\nTo express this result as a reduced fraction, we first clear the decimals by multiplying the numerator and denominator by $1000$:\n$$P(S | T^{-}) = \\frac{14}{896}$$\nWe simplify this fraction by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor. We start by dividing by $2$:\n$$\\frac{14 \\div 2}{896 \\div 2} = \\frac{7}{448}$$\nNext, we check if $448$ is divisible by $7$. Performing the division, $448 \\div 7 = 64$. Thus, we can further reduce the fraction by dividing by $7$:\n$$\\frac{7 \\div 7}{448 \\div 7} = \\frac{1}{64}$$\nThe post-test probability of the patient having active syphilis despite a negative RPR test is $\\frac{1}{64}$.",

            "solution": "The problem requires the derivation of a closed-form expression for the Number Needed to Treat (NNT) in terms of the Absolute Risk Reduction (ARR) from first principles, and then to compute the NNT for a given ARR value.\n\nFirst, we establish the fundamental definitions based on the problem statement. Let the adverse endpoint be a dichotomous outcome. We can represent this outcome for a single patient with a Bernoulli random variable, $X$, where $X=1$ if the adverse endpoint occurs and $X=0$ if it does not.\n\nLet $p_{C}$ be the probability of the adverse endpoint in the control group. For a randomly selected patient in the control group, the outcome variable $X_{C}$ has a probability mass function $P(X_{C}=1) = p_{C}$ and $P(X_{C}=0) = 1-p_{C}$. The expected value of this outcome is $E[X_{C}] = 1 \\cdot p_{C} + 0 \\cdot (1-p_{C}) = p_{C}$. This expected value represents the risk of the adverse endpoint in the control group.\n\nSimilarly, let $p_{T}$ be the probability of the adverse endpoint in the treatment group. For a patient in the treatment group, the outcome variable $X_{T}$ has an expected value $E[X_{T}] = p_{T}$. This is the risk of the adverse endpoint in the treatment group.\n\nThe problem defines the Absolute Risk Reduction (ARR) as the difference in risk between the control and treatment groups. This is also known as the risk difference.\n$$\nARR = p_{C} - p_{T}\n$$\nA positive ARR indicates that the treatment reduces the risk of the adverse endpoint.\n\nThe Number Needed to Treat (NNT) is defined as the expected number of patients who need to be treated with the experimental therapy to prevent one additional adverse endpoint compared to what would have been observed with the control therapy.\n\nConsider a cohort of $N$ patients. If all $N$ patients receive the control intervention, the expected number of adverse endpoints is the sum of the individual expected values:\n$$\nE[\\text{Number of endpoints in control}] = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} E[X_{C,i}] = N \\cdot E[X_{C}] = N \\cdot p_{C}\n$$\nIf, instead, all $N$ patients receive the treatment, the expected number of adverse endpoints is:\n$$\nE[\\text{Number of endpoints in treatment}] = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} E[X_{T,i}] = N \\cdot E[X_{T}] = N \\cdot p_{T}\n$$\nThe expected number of adverse endpoints prevented by treating these $N$ patients is the difference between the expected counts in the control and treatment scenarios:\n$$\n\\text{Endpoints prevented} = (N \\cdot p_{C}) - (N \\cdot p_{T}) = N(p_{C} - p_{T})\n$$\nThe NNT is the specific value of $N$ for which the number of prevented endpoints is exactly one. We set the expression for endpoints prevented equal to $1$ and solve for $N$, which we then call NNT.\n$$\n1 = NNT \\cdot (p_{C} - p_{T})\n$$\nSolving for NNT, we obtain:\n$$\nNNT = \\frac{1}{p_{C} - p_{T}}\n$$\nNow, we can substitute the definition of ARR into this equation. Since $ARR = p_{C} - p_{T}$, we have:\n$$\nNNT = \\frac{1}{ARR}\n$$\nThis is the closed-form analytical expression for NNT in terms of ARR, derived from first principles.\n\nThe second part of the problem is to compute the numeric value of NNT for the given ARR. The problem states that the study reports an ARR of $0.25$.\n$$\nARR = 0.25\n$$\nUsing the derived formula:\n$$\nNNT = \\frac{1}{0.25}\n$$\nPerforming the calculation:\n$$\nNNT = 4\n$$\nThe result is an exact integer, so no approximation or rounding is necessary. The value $NNT=4$ means that, on average, $4$ patients must be treated with oral acyclovir to prevent one additional case of failure to achieve complete rash resolution by day $14$, compared to placebo.",

            "problem": "A young adult presents with pityriasis rosea, a self-limited papulosquamous eruption likely associated with human herpesvirus $6$ or $7$. Although supportive care is standard, randomized trials have suggested that antiviral therapy with acyclovir may shorten disease duration in selected cases. The usual adult oral regimen for acyclovir in the context of pityriasis rosea is an $800$ mg dose administered five times daily for $7$ days under normal renal function. You are asked to calculate the adjusted dosing regimen in a patient with renal impairment and then compute the total number of $800$ mg tablets needed for the full $7$-day course.\n\nUse the following scientifically established bases:\n- For renally cleared drugs like acyclovir, the drug clearance $CL$ scales approximately with the estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate (eGFR), that is, $CL \\propto eGFR$.\n- To preserve the average steady-state concentration, the dosing interval $\\tau$ should be increased when $CL$ is decreased, based on the relationship $C_{\\text{ss,avg}} = \\frac{F \\cdot D}{CL \\cdot \\tau}$, where $F$ is bioavailability and $D$ is dose.\n- For oral acyclovir, clinically validated $eGFR$-based interval modifications are discretized as follows: if $eGFR > 25$ mL/min, use $800$ mg every $4$ hours while awake (five times daily); if $10 \\leq eGFR \\leq 25$ mL/min, use $800$ mg every $8$ hours; if $eGFR < 10$ mL/min, use $800$ mg every $12$ hours.\n\nConsider a $68$-year-old female with weight $62$ kg and serum creatinine $Scr = 2.3$ mg/dL.

            "solution": "The problem requires the calculation of the total number of $800$ mg acyclovir tablets for a $7$-day course for a patient with renal impairment. This necessitates a multi-step process beginning with the assessment of the patient's renal function, followed by the determination of the adjusted dosing regimen, and concluding with the calculation of the total tablet count.\n\nFirst, we must estimate the patient's renal function. The problem specifies using the Cockcroft–Gault (CG) equation to approximate the estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate ($eGFR$). The CG equation estimates creatinine clearance ($CrCl$), and for the purposes of this problem, we will use $eGFR \\approx CrCl$. The formula is:\n$$CrCl = \\frac{(140 - \\text{Age}) \\times \\text{Weight}}{72 \\times Scr}$$\nwhere Age is in years, Weight is in kilograms, and serum creatinine ($Scr$) is in mg/dL. For female patients, the result is multiplied by a correction factor of $0.85$.\n\nThe given patient data are:\n- Age: $68$ years\n- Sex: Female\n- Weight: $62$ kg\n- Serum Creatinine ($Scr$): $2.3$ mg/dL\n\nSubstituting these values into the CG equation for a female patient:\n$$eGFR \\approx CrCl = \\left( \\frac{(140 - 68) \\times 62}{72 \\times 2.3} \\right) \\times 0.85$$\n$$eGFR \\approx \\left( \\frac{72 \\times 62}{165.6} \\right) \\times 0.85$$\n$$eGFR \\approx \\left( \\frac{4464}{165.6} \\right) \\times 0.85$$\n$$eGFR \\approx 26.9565... \\times 0.85$$\n$$eGFR \\approx 22.913... \\text{ mL/min}$$\n\nThe calculated $eGFR$ is approximately $22.91$ mL/min.\n\nNext, we must determine the appropriate dosing interval, $\\tau$, using the provided clinically validated guidelines for oral acyclovir $800$ mg:\n- If $eGFR > 25$ mL/min, use $800$ mg every $4$ hours while awake (five times daily).\n- If $10 \\leq eGFR \\leq 25$ mL/min, use $800$ mg every $8$ hours.\n- If $eGFR < 10$ mL/min, use $800$ mg every $12$ hours.\n\nOur calculated value of $eGFR \\approx 22.91$ mL/min falls within the range $10 \\leq eGFR \\leq 25$ mL/min. Therefore, the appropriate dosing regimen for this patient is an $800$ mg dose administered every $8$ hours. The dosing interval is $\\tau = 8$ hours.\n\nWith the dosing interval established, we can calculate the number of doses per day. A day has $24$ hours.\n$$\\text{Doses per day} = \\frac{24 \\text{ hours}}{8 \\text{ hours/dose}} = 3 \\text{ doses/day}$$\n\nFinally, we calculate the total number of tablets required for the full $7$-day course of therapy.
