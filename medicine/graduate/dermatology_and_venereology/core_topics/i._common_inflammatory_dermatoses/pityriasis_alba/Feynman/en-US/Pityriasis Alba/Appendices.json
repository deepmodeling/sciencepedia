            "introduction": "Diagnosing hypopigmented patches in a pediatric population is a common yet critical task. While pityriasis alba is a frequent and benign diagnosis, it shares features with a spectrum of other conditions, some of which carry significant morbidity. This exercise challenges you to move beyond simple pattern recognition and develop a systematic, resource-conscious diagnostic algorithm, a core skill for any practicing dermatologist. By structuring your approach using clinical findings and basic office-based tests, you learn to efficiently differentiate pityriasis alba from its key mimics and recognize when to escalate care .",

            "problem": "A pediatric dermatology clinic evaluates a child with hypopigmented patches. You are asked to choose the most scientifically justified, stepwise office-based algorithm to distinguish pityriasis alba from tinea versicolor, vitiligo, hypopigmented leprosy, nevus depigmentosus, and hypopigmented mycosis fungoides in a resource-conscious setting. The candidate has a history of atopic tendencies and has developed asymptomatic facial patches after outdoor play. The following constraints apply: limit yourself to clinical examination, Wood’s lamp, potassium hydroxide preparation, simple bedside sensory testing, and peripheral nerve palpation; defer invasive tests to only when non-invasive steps are exhausted.\n\nWhich option best specifies an ordered sequence of decision points that would, in a typical child of age $8$ to $12$ years, correctly classify the cause of hypopigmentation using clinical observation and basic office tests, and indicate when to escalate?\n\nA. Begin with targeted history and morphology: ascertain onset (neonatal versus childhood), course (stable versus evolving), and distribution (face versus seborrheic trunk), and look for fine xerotic scale and ill-defined borders suggesting surface dryness. If fine scale is suspected, gently stroke the lesion to elicit evoked scale (stroke sign) and perform a potassium hydroxide preparation to detect short hyphae and clustered spores; a positive preparation supports tinea versicolor. If the preparation is negative or scale is minimal, use Wood’s lamp ($\\approx 365\\,\\mathrm{nm}$): bright blue-white accentuation with sharply demarcated margins and possible leukotrichia supports vitiligo; minimal accentuation with residual pigment and poorly defined edges is consistent with pityriasis alba. Next, assess light touch, pinprick, and temperature over the patch and palpate peripheral nerves; sensory loss with nerve thickening favors hypopigmented leprosy. If the patch was present since birth and is stable in size and shape with serrated borders, favor nevus depigmentosus. In persistent, non-infectious hypopigmented patches on trunk or proximal limbs in darker phototypes, with pruritus and no fluorescence and negative preparation, consider hypopigmented mycosis fungoides and reserve biopsy for unresolved cases after these steps.\n\nB. Start with Wood’s lamp for all hypopigmented patches: any fluorescence change is classified as tinea versicolor; lack of fluorescence indicates pityriasis alba. Only if anesthesia is present should hypopigmented leprosy be considered. Reserve potassium hydroxide preparation for cases with bright fluorescence and treat vitiligo empirically if fluorescence is faint. Defer nerve palpation and avoid biopsy unless the Wood’s lamp is inconclusive.\n\nC. Prioritize neurologic examination: perform sensory testing and nerve palpation first, and if normal, proceed directly to biopsy to exclude hypopigmented mycosis fungoides. Use potassium hydroxide preparation only if the biopsy is negative. Employ Wood’s lamp last and interpret poor accentuation as evidence against vitiligo. Tinea versicolor is diagnosed when biopsy shows inflammation without atypical lymphocytes.\n\nD. Start with diascopy and dermographism; if dermographism is present, label the patches as pityriasis alba. Use potassium hydroxide preparation only when there is no visible scale. Diagnose nevus depigmentosus based on bright blue-white fluorescence under Wood’s lamp. Consider hypopigmented leprosy only when hair depigmentation is present and do not rely on nerve palpation.\n\nE. Initiate with potassium hydroxide scraping in all cases, especially when no scale is visible. Use ultraviolet A provocation to differentiate vitiligo from nevus depigmentosus by tanning response. Classify any anesthetic patch as vitiligo and exclude hypopigmented mycosis fungoides based on absence of pruritus. Biopsy only when Wood’s lamp is negative and potassium hydroxide preparation is positive.",
            "solution": "The user has requested a critical evaluation of a clinical problem in pediatric dermatology, requiring the selection of the most scientifically justified, stepwise diagnostic algorithm for hypopigmented patches in a child.\n\n**Part 1: Problem Statement Validation**\n\n**Step 1: Extract Givens**\n- **Clinical Setting:** Pediatric dermatology clinic.\n- **Patient Profile:** A child with hypopigmented patches.\n- **Specific History:** The child has a history of atopic tendencies and developed asymptomatic facial patches after outdoor play. Age is specified as typical for an $8$ to $12$ year old.\n- **Diagnostic Goal:** To distinguish pityriasis alba from tinea versicolor, vitiligo, hypopigmented leprosy, nevus depigmentosus, and hypopigmented mycosis fungoides.\n- **Constraints:**\n    1.  The setting is resource-conscious.\n    2.  Allowed diagnostic tools are limited to: clinical examination, Wood’s lamp, potassium hydroxide (KOH) preparation, simple bedside sensory testing, and peripheral nerve palpation.\n    3.  Invasive tests (e.g., biopsy) are to be deferred until non-invasive steps are exhausted.\n- **Question:** Identify the option that best specifies an ordered sequence of decision points to correctly classify the cause of hypopigmentation under the given constraints. A specific Wood's lamp wavelength of $\\approx 365\\,\\mathrm{nm}$ is mentioned.\n\n**Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens**\n- **Scientifically Grounded:** The problem is firmly rooted in the medical science of dermatology. The differential diagnosis for hypopigmented patches in a child is standard and clinically relevant. The described patient history (atopy, sun exposure) and initial presentation are classic for pityriasis alba. The diagnostic tools listed (clinical exam, KOH prep, Wood's lamp, sensory testing) are fundamental office-based procedures in dermatology. The specified wavelength for a Wood's lamp ($\\approx 365\\,\\mathrm{nm}$) is correct. The problem is free of pseudoscience and factually sound.\n- **Well-Posed:** The problem asks to select the *best* algorithm from a set of options. The goal is clear: a logical, ordered, and resource-conscious diagnostic sequence. Given a set of distinct options, a best choice can be determined based on established clinical principles.\n- **Objective:** The problem is stated in precise, objective clinical language. The constraints are unambiguous.\n- **Other Flaws:**\n    - The problem is not incomplete or contradictory; it provides sufficient context to evaluate the proposed algorithms.\n    - The scenario is highly realistic and common in clinical practice.\n    - The question is well-structured and requires substantive clinical reasoning, not a trivial or tautological answer.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem statement is **valid**. It is a well-formulated question in clinical reasoning that is scientifically sound, objective, and testable against established medical knowledge. I will proceed to derive the solution.\n\n**Part 2: Solution Derivation and Option Analysis**\n\nA scientifically justified algorithm for diagnosing hypopigmented patches in a child, given the constraints, should proceed from the least invasive and most probable diagnoses to the more complex, guided by a sequence of observations and simple tests.\n\n1.  **History and Clinical Examination:** This is the foundational first step. The history of atopy and development of asymptomatic facial patches after sun exposure is highly suggestive of pityriasis alba (PA). The clinical examination should focus on the morphology of the lesions: number, distribution, definition of borders (ill-defined in PA, well-defined in vitiligo), and surface characteristics (e.g., fine scale in PA and tinea versicolor (TV)). Eliciting fine scale by gently stroking the lesion (the \"stroke sign\" or `signe de la carte de visite`) is a classic maneuver.\n2.  **Potassium Hydroxide (KOH) Preparation:** If fine scale is present or elicited, a KOH preparation is the next logical step. It is a rapid, inexpensive test to rule in or out tinea versicolor. A positive prep showing short hyphae and spores (the \"spaghetti and meatballs\" pattern) confirms TV. A negative result makes TV less likely and increases the probability of PA.\n3.  **Wood's Lamp Examination:** A Wood's lamp (long-wave ultraviolet A light, $\\approx 365\\,\\mathrm{nm}$) is crucial for differentiating disorders of pigmentation.\n    - **Vitiligo:** Shows dramatic, bright, chalk-white or blue-white accentuation with sharply demarcated borders due to the complete absence of melanin.\n    - **Pityriasis Alba & Nevus Depigmentosus:** Being hypopigmented (reduced melanin) rather than depigmented (absent melanin), they show only slight accentuation or appear off-white. The borders of PA remain ill-defined.\n    - **Tinea Versicolor:** May show a characteristic, but not always present, pale yellow-green fluorescence. A negative Wood's lamp does not rule it out.\n    - **Hypopigmented Leprosy & Hypopigmented Mycosis Fungoides (HMF):** Typically do not fluoresce.\n4.  **Neurological Examination:** If leprosy is on the differential (e.g., atypical morphology, endemic location, or if other diagnoses are ruled out), bedside sensory testing (light touch, pinprick, temperature) over the patch and palpation of associated peripheral nerves for thickening are indicated. Sensory loss in a hypopigmented patch is a cardinal sign of leprosy.\n5.  **Long-term Observation & Biopsy:** For lesions present since birth (congenital) and stable, a diagnosis of nevus depigmentosus is favored based on history. For persistent, atypical, or enlarging patches where the diagnosis remains unclear after the above non-invasive workup, particularly if HMF is a consideration (e.g., pruritic patches on the trunk in a darker phototype), escalation to a skin biopsy is the final, necessary step, consistent with the problem's constraints.\n\n**Option-by-Option Analysis**\n\n**A. Begin with targeted history and morphology... perform a potassium hydroxide preparation... use Wood’s lamp... assess light touch... consider hypopigmented mycosis fungoides and reserve biopsy for unresolved cases...**\nThis option presents a logical, stepwise algorithm that perfectly aligns with the principles derived above. It starts with history/exam, proceeds to simple tests (KOH, Wood's lamp) guided by clinical findings, correctly incorporates neurological testing for leprosy, and appropriately reserves biopsy as the final step for unresolved cases. The descriptions of the findings for each test (e.g., KOH for TV, Wood's lamp for vitiligo vs. PA) are scientifically accurate.\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\n**B. Start with Wood’s lamp for all hypopigmented patches... any fluorescence change is classified as tinea versicolor; lack of fluorescence indicates pityriasis alba... Reserve potassium hydroxide preparation for cases with bright fluorescence...**\nThis option is deeply flawed. Starting with a Wood's lamp before a clinical exam is suboptimal. The assertion that \"any fluorescence change is classified as tinea versicolor\" is factually incorrect; vitiligo produces the most dramatic fluorescence (bright blue-white). \"Lack of fluorescence\" is not specific to pityriasis alba. Reserving KOH for cases with \"bright fluorescence\" is nonsensical, as bright fluorescence suggests vitiligo, which is not a fungal infection.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**C. Prioritize neurologic examination: perform sensory testing and nerve palpation first... proceed directly to biopsy to exclude hypopigmented mycosis fungoides... Use potassium hydroxide preparation only if the biopsy is negative...**\nThis algorithm is illogical and violates the problem constraints. Prioritizing a neurological exam for leprosy is not indicated as a first step for a general pediatric setting. Proceeding directly to an invasive biopsy after a normal neurological exam is a gross violation of the principle of exhausting non-invasive options first. Performing a simple KOH test only after a biopsy is clinically absurd.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**D. Start with diascopy and dermographism... Diagnose nevus depigmentosus based on bright blue-white fluorescence under Wood’s lamp... do not rely on nerve palpation.**\nThis option contains multiple factual errors. Diascopy is not a primary tool for hypopigmentation. Dermographism is not a diagnostic test for pityriasis alba. The claim that nevus depigmentosus shows \"bright blue-white fluorescence\" is false; this finding is characteristic of vitiligo. Advising not to rely on nerve palpation for leprosy is dangerous and contrary to standard medical practice, as a thickened nerve is a cardinal sign.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**E. Initiate with potassium hydroxide scraping in all cases, especially when no scale is visible... Classify any anesthetic patch as vitiligo... Biopsy only when Wood’s lamp is negative and potassium hydroxide preparation is positive.**\nThis option contains critical, dangerous errors. Performing a KOH prep without visible or elicited scale is a very low-yield procedure. Classifying an anesthetic patch as vitiligo is a major diagnostic blunder; anesthesia is the hallmark of leprosy, while sensation in vitiligo is normal. The instruction to biopsy when a KOH prep is positive is completely irrational; a positive KOH confirms a fungal infection (tinea versicolor), which is treated with antifungals, not diagnosed further with an invasive biopsy.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\nBased on the comprehensive analysis, Option A is the only one that presents a scientifically sound, clinically logical, and resource-conscious algorithm that adheres to all the problem's constraints.",

            "solution": "The problem is first validated to ensure it is scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and internally consistent.\n\n**Step 1: Extract Givens**\n- Total number of children in the cohort, $N = 200$.\n- Total number of children with pityriasis alba, $N_{PA} = 30$.\n- Total number of children with atopy, $N_{A} = 100$.\n- Number of children with both pityriasis alba and atopy, $N_{PA \\cap A} = 24$.\n- Definition of odds: The odds of an event equals the count with the event divided by the count without the event in that stratum.\n- Definition of odds ratio (OR): The OR is the ratio of the odds across strata.\n- The task is to compute the odds ratio for pityriasis alba in children with atopy relative to children without atopy.\n- The final result must be rounded to $4$ significant figures.\n\n**Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens**\nThe problem is a standard epidemiological calculation based on data from a cohort study. The variables (pityriasis alba, atopy) are well-defined medical conditions. The provided numerical data are internally consistent. Let's construct a $2 \\times 2$ contingency table to verify this. Let $A$ denote the presence of atopy and $PA$ denote the presence of pityriasis alba.\n\nThe given values are:\n- Cell $a$ (children with $A$ and $PA$): $a = N_{PA \\cap A} = 24$.\n- Marginal total for $A$: $a+c = N_A = 100$. This implies $c = 100 - 24 = 76$.\n- Marginal total for $PA$: $a+b = N_{PA} = 30$. This implies $b = 30 - 24 = 6$.\n- The total population is $N=200$. The number of children without atopy is $N - N_A = 200 - 100 = 100$. This corresponds to the marginal total $b+d = 100$, so $d = 100 - b = 100 - 6 = 94$.\n- We can cross-check the marginal total for children without pityriasis alba: $c+d = 76 + 94 = 170$. The total number of children without pityriasis alba should be $N - N_{PA} = 200 - 30 = 170$. The counts are consistent.\n\nThe problem statement is scientifically sound, well-posed, objective, and provides a complete and consistent set of data. Therefore, it is valid.\n\n**Step 3: Solution**\nTo compute the odds ratio for pityriasis alba ($PA$) in children with atopy ($A$) relative to children without atopy (not $A$), we first organize the data into a standard $2 \\times 2$ contingency table.

We must calculate the odds of pityriasis alba within each stratum (atopic and non-atopic).\n\nFollowing the provided definition, the odds of an event is the ratio of the number of individuals with the event to the number of individuals without the event within a given stratum.\n\n1.  **Odds of pityriasis alba in the atopic group ($A+$):**\n    This stratum consists of children with atopy.

The outcome of interest is repigmentation by week $8$.\n\nLet $P_{HC}$ be the probability of achieving repigmentation in the hydrocortisone group.\n$$ P_{HC} = 0.60 $$\nLet $P_{E}$ be the probability of achieving repigmentation in the emollient (control) group.\n$$ P_{E} = 0.45 $$\n\nThe problem asks to first compute the benefit of hydrocortisone in terms of the reduction in the probability of the negative outcome, which is \"non-repigmentation\".
