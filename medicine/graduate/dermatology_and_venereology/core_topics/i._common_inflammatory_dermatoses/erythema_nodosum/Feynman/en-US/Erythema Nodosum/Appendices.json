            "problem": "A clinician evaluates a patient with tender erythematous subcutaneous nodules on the lower legs and suspects erythema nodosum based on history and examination. Erythema nodosum is a prototypical form of panniculitis characterized histopathologically as septal panniculitis without vasculitis and clinically by sudden onset of tender, warm, erythematous nodules classically on the anterior shins, bilaterally and symmetrically, with a self-limited course and resolution without ulceration or scarring. Differential diagnoses include other panniculitides (for example, erythema induratum, also known as nodular vasculitis, which is a lobular panniculitis with vasculitis often involving posterior calves and may ulcerate), medium vessel vasculitis, infectious cellulitis or panniculitis, superficial thrombophlebitis, and disorders such as pancreatic panniculitis or lupus panniculitis. Skin biopsy in suspected erythema nodosum is generally reserved for atypical presentations because biopsy requires a deep incisional sample into subcutaneous fat and clinical diagnosis is often straightforward when classic features are present. Using these foundational definitions and well-tested clinical observations as the base, select all findings that should prompt skin biopsy and an expanded workup to exclude alternate diagnoses rather than assuming a straightforward case of erythema nodosum.\n\nWhich of the following findings should prompt biopsy and broader diagnostic evaluation to exclude alternate diagnoses?\n\nA. Bilateral tender nodules confined to the anterior shins that do not ulcerate and fade without scarring over a self-limited course\n\nB. Nodules clustered on a single leg with marked asymmetry and unilateral distribution\n\nC. Predominant nodules on the posterior calves with livedoid changes and evolving ulcers\n\nD. High-grade systemic toxicity with rigors, hypotension, and concern for sepsis\n\nE. Migratory ankle and knee arthralgias without synovitis accompanying tender anterior shin nodules\n\nF. Failure of nodules to show any tendency to resolve and a prolonged, persistent course beyond the expected self-limited timeframe\n\nG. Ulceration or suppuration of nodules in the involved areas\n\nH.

            "solution": "The user has provided a clinical problem in dermatology and venereology and has requested a rigorous, principle-based validation and solution.\n\n### Step 1: Problem Validation\n\n**Extraction of Givens:**\n1.  **Patient Presentation:** Tender erythematous subcutaneous nodules on the lower legs.\n2.  **Suspected Diagnosis:** Erythema nodosum (EN).\n3.  **Definition of Classic Erythema Nodosum (EN):**\n    *   Histopathology: Septal panniculitis without vasculitis.\n    *   Clinical Features: Sudden onset of tender, warm, erythematous nodules.\n    *   Location: Classically on the anterior shins, bilaterally and symmetrically.\n    *   Course: Self-limited, with resolution without ulceration or scarring.\n4.  **Differential Diagnoses Mentioned:** Erythema induratum (nodular vasculitis), medium vessel vasculitis, infectious cellulitis or panniculitis, superficial thrombophlebitis, pancreatic panniculitis, lupus panniculitis.\n5.  **Role of Biopsy in EN:** Reserved for atypical presentations, as clinical diagnosis is often straightforward in classic cases. Requires a deep incisional sample.\n6.  **Question:** Identify all findings that would be considered atypical for classic EN, thus prompting a skin biopsy and a broader diagnostic workup to exclude alternate diagnoses.\n\n**Validation Analysis:**\nThe problem statement is evaluated against the required criteria.\n\n*   **Scientifically Grounded:** The problem is firmly rooted in established medical principles of dermatology and rheumatology. The descriptions of erythema nodosum, its classic presentation, its histopathology, and its key differential diagnoses are all factually and medically accurate.\n*   **Well-Posed:** The problem is well-posed. It provides a clear, standard definition of classic erythema nodosum and asks the solver to identify clinical scenarios that deviate from this classic picture. This creates a logical framework for a unique and meaningful solution.\n*   **Objective:** The problem is stated in objective, clinical language, free from ambiguity or subjective claims. The features described (e.g., location, ulceration, symmetry) are observable clinical signs.\n\nThe problem does not exhibit any of the enumerated flaws:\n1.  It does not contain scientific or factual unsoundness.\n2.  It is directly relevant to the stated topic and is not metaphorical.\n3.  It provides a complete and consistent setup.\n4.  The clinical scenarios are realistic.\n5.  The structure allows for a clear, non-ambiguous solution.\n6.  The problem requires nuanced clinical reasoning and is not trivial or tautological.\n7.  The assertions are based on verifiable clinical science.\n\n**Verdict:** The problem statement is valid. I will proceed to the solution.\n\n### Step 2: Solution and Option-by-Option Analysis\n\nThe fundamental task is to distinguish findings consistent with the provided definition of classic erythema nodosum (EN) from those that are atypical and thus warrant further investigation, including biopsy. Classic EN is a bilateral, symmetric, septal panniculitis on the anterior shins that is self-limited and does not ulcerate.\n\n**A. Bilateral tender nodules confined to the anterior shins that do not ulcerate and fade without scarring over a self-limited course**\nThis description is a verbatim recitation of the classic features of erythema nodosum as defined in the problem statement. The features include the correct location (anterior shins), distribution (bilateral), morphology (nodules that do not ulcerate), and course (self-limited, no scarring). The presence of these findings strongly supports a clinical diagnosis of EN, making a biopsy unnecessary in the absence of other confounding factors.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**B. Nodules clustered on a single leg with marked asymmetry and unilateral distribution**\nThe classic presentation of EN is \"bilaterally and symmetrically.\" A unilateral or significantly asymmetric distribution is a deviation from this pattern. While EN can, in rare cases, be unilateral, this presentation is atypical and significantly broadens the differential diagnosis to include infectious panniculitis, traumatic panniculitis, malignancy, and other localized inflammatory conditions. A biopsy would be prudent to establish a definitive diagnosis.\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\n**C. Predominant nodules on the posterior calves with livedoid changes and evolving ulcers**\nThis presentation has three major features that are atypical for classic EN and highly suggestive of an alternative diagnosis. First, the location on the posterior calves is the classic site for erythema induratum (nodular vasculitis), not EN. Second, the presence of \"evolving ulcers\" is a critical feature, as EN is defined as non-ulcerating. Ulceration points towards vasculitis or infection. Third, \"livedoid changes\" (a net-like, purplish skin discoloration) suggest compromised blood flow, often from an underlying vasculitis, which is pathologically absent in EN (a \"septal panniculitis without vasculitis\"). A biopsy is mandatory.\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\n**D. High-grade systemic toxicity with rigors, hypotension, and concern for sepsis**\nWhile EN can be associated with low-grade fever, malaise, and arthralgias, profound systemic toxicity with rigors and hypotension is highly unusual. These are alarm signs for a life-threatening systemic process, most commonly sepsis. The skin lesions in such a context could represent septic emboli, infectious panniculitis (e.g., from a virulent bacterium), or a manifestation of a severe systemic inflammatory disease. This clinical picture is a medical emergency that demands an immediate, extensive workup, which could include blood cultures, imaging, and a skin biopsy to identify a pathogen or underlying pathology. It is not consistent with uncomplicated EN.\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\n**E. Migratory ankle and knee arthralgias without synovitis accompanying tender anterior shin nodules**\nMigratory arthralgia (joint pain) is a very common extracutaneous manifestation of erythema nodosum, occurring in up to $50\\%$ of patients. Its presence alongside the classic skin nodules on the anterior shins actually strengthens the clinical diagnosis of EN rather than casting doubt on it. This finding is typical, not atypical.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**F. Failure of nodules to show any tendency to resolve and a prolonged, persistent course beyond the expected self-limited timeframe**\nClassic EN is defined by its \"self-limited course,\" typically resolving within $3$ to $6$ weeks. Lesions that persist or progress beyond this timeframe define a chronic or persistent panniculitis. This atypical course necessitates further investigation to rule out underlying chronic infections (e.g., tuberculosis), malignancy (e.g., lymphoma), or other systemic inflammatory diseases that can cause a persistent panniculitis. A biopsy is indicated.\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\n**G. Ulceration or suppuration of nodules in the involved areas**\nThe definition of classic EN explicitly states that it resolves \"without ulceration.\" Ulceration is a key \"red flag\" sign that suggests an alternative diagnosis. Ulcerating panniculitides include erythema induratum, vasculitis like polyarteritis nodosa, deep fungal or atypical mycobacterial infections, and alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency panniculitis. Suppuration (pus formation) strongly implies an infectious etiology. A biopsy for histopathology and tissue culture is essential in this setting.\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\n**H. Palpable, painful cord-like subcutaneous strands along superficial veins with overlying erythema in the calf region**\nThis is the pathognomonic clinical description of superficial thrombophlebitis, which is one of the differential diagnoses for tender red nodules on the leg. EN presents as discrete, somewhat mobile nodules within the subcutaneous fat, not as linear, cord-like structures conforming to the path of a vein. This finding points directly to a specific alternative diagnosis and away from EN. While the primary diagnostic tool might be a duplex ultrasound, this clinical picture absolutely demands an \"expanded workup\" to confirm thrombophlebitis and rule out a hypercoagulable state. It is not EN.\n**Verdict: Correct**",

            "problem": "An adult patient presents with tender erythematous subcutaneous nodules consistent with erythema nodosum. In the same visit, chest radiography demonstrates bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy (BHL), and clinical examination reveals acute, symmetric ankle arthritis. You are practicing in a tertiary dermatology and venereology clinic where the pre-test probability of sarcoidosis among patients presenting with erythema nodosum is $0.25$. For diagnostic reasoning, use the following well-tested parameters:\n\n- The positive likelihood ratio (LR) for bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy on chest radiography for sarcoidosis among patients with erythema nodosum is $\\mathrm{LR}^{+} = 12$.\n- The positive likelihood ratio for acute ankle arthritis for sarcoidosis among patients with erythema nodosum is $\\mathrm{LR}^{+} = 4$.\n\nAssume that, conditional on the true disease state (sarcoidosis present or absent), the chest radiography finding and the clinical ankle arthritis finding are independent.

            "solution": "The task is to compute the posterior probability that the patient has sarcoidosis given two positive findings (bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy on chest radiography and acute ankle arthritis) in a patient with erythema nodosum, beginning from fundamental principles. We use Bayes’ theorem in its odds form alongside the definition of the likelihood ratio.\n\nStart by defining the pre-test probability and odds. Let $P(D)$ denote the prior probability of sarcoidosis in a patient with erythema nodosum. We are given $P(D) = 0.25$. The corresponding prior odds $O(D)$ are defined by\n$$\nO(D) = \\frac{P(D)}{1 - P(D)} = \\frac{0.25}{1 - 0.25} = \\frac{0.25}{0.75} = \\frac{1}{3}.\n$$\n\nNext, recall the definition of the positive likelihood ratio $\\mathrm{LR}^{+}$ for a test: it is\n$$\n\\mathrm{LR}^{+} = \\frac{P(\\text{positive test} \\mid D)}{P(\\text{positive test} \\mid \\neg D)}.\n$$\nWhen multiple tests are conditionally independent given the disease state, the combined likelihood ratio is the product of the individual likelihood ratios. Here, we have two positive findings:\n- Bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy on chest radiography with $\\mathrm{LR}^{+}_{\\text{BHL}} = 12$.\n- Acute ankle arthritis with $\\mathrm{LR}^{+}_{\\text{arthritis}} = 4$.\n\nUnder conditional independence, the combined likelihood ratio is\n$$\n\\mathrm{LR}^{+}_{\\text{combined}} = \\mathrm{LR}^{+}_{\\text{BHL}} \\times \\mathrm{LR}^{+}_{\\text{arthritis}} = 12 \\times 4 = 48.\n$$\n\nBayes’ theorem in odds form updates the prior odds to posterior odds $O(D \\mid \\text{data})$ by multiplying by the combined likelihood ratio:\n$$\nO(D \\mid \\text{BHL, arthritis}) = O(D) \\times \\mathrm{LR}^{+}_{\\text{combined}} = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 48 = 16.\n$$\n\nFinally, convert posterior odds back to posterior probability. Probability $P$ is related to odds $O$ by\n$$\nP = \\frac{O}{1 + O}.\n$$\nTherefore,\n$$\nP(D \\mid \\text{BHL, arthritis}) = \\frac{16}{1 + 16} = \\frac{16}{17}.\n$$\n\nCompute the numerical value:\n$$\n\\frac{16}{17} \\approx 0.9411764706\\ldots\n$$\nRounded to four significant figures (as a unitless decimal):\n$$\n0.9412.\n$$\n\nThus, the posterior probability that the patient’s erythema nodosum is due to sarcoidosis, given bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy and acute ankle arthritis, is $0.9412$.",

The solution process may proceed.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe problem requires the calculation of two key epidemiological measures from the results of a randomized controlled trial: the absolute risk difference and the number needed to treat.\n\nLet $R_{T}$ be the cumulative incidence, or risk, of the beneficial outcome in the treatment group (colchicine).\nLet $R_{C}$ be the cumulative incidence, or risk, of the beneficial outcome in the control group (placebo).\n\nFrom the problem statement, we are given:\n$$R_{T} = 0.70$$\n$$R_{C} = 0.50$$\n\nThe first quantity to compute is the absolute risk difference for benefit. Since the treatment increases the probability of a good outcome (resolution), this is sometimes referred to as the absolute risk increase or, more generally, the absolute risk difference (ARD). It is defined as the difference between the risk in the treatment group and the risk in the control group.\n\nThe formula for the absolute risk difference is:\n$$ARD = R_{T} - R_{C}$$\n\nSubstituting the given values into the formula:\n$$ARD = 0.70 - 0.50$$\n$$ARD = 0.20$$\nThis value represents the absolute increase in the probability of achieving complete resolution by week $4$ due to treatment with colchicine compared to placebo.\n\nThe second quantity to compute is the Number Needed to Treat (NNT). The NNT represents the average number of patients who must be treated with the intervention (colchicine) for one additional patient to experience the beneficial outcome (resolution) compared to what would have been expected with the control (placebo). The NNT is the reciprocal of the absolute risk difference.\n\nThe formula for the NNT is:\n$$NNT = \\frac{1}{ARD}$$\n\nUsing the calculated value of $ARD$:\n$$NNT = \\frac{1}{0.20}$$\nTo calculate this, we can express $0.20$ as a fraction:\n$$NNT = \\frac{1}{\\frac{20}{100}} = \\frac{1}{\\frac{1}{5}}$$\n$$NNT = 5$$\n\nTherefore, on average, $5$ patients with erythema nodosum must be treated with colchicine for $4$ weeks for one additional patient to achieve complete resolution who would not have done so on placebo.\n\nThe problem requires the final result to be reported as a two-entry row vector in the order: absolute risk difference, NNT.\nThe absolute risk difference is $0.20$.\nThe Number Needed to Treat is $5$.\n\nThe resulting vector is $[0.20, 5]$.",
