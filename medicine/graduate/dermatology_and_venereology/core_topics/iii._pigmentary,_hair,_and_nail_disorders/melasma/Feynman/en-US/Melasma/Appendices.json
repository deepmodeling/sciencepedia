            "problem": "A clinician-scientist is modeling the effect of a topical tyrosinase inhibitor used in melasma on melanocyte tyrosinase activity. In vitro measurements under physiological conditions relevant to epidermal melanocytes show that the baseline enzyme kinetics for the conversion of L-tyrosine to L-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (L-DOPA) follow a Michaelis–Menten relationship with a Michaelis constant $K_m$ for L-tyrosine of $0.20\\,\\mathrm{mM}$.

            "solution": "The task is to derive an expression for the fractional inhibition, $F$, of an enzyme-catalyzed reaction under competitive inhibition and then to compute its value. The fractional inhibition is defined as $F = 1 - v_{i}/v_{0}$, where $v_{0}$ is the uninhibited initial reaction rate and $v_{i}$ is the inhibited initial rate.\n\nFirst, we establish the rate equation for the uninhibited reaction, which follows Michaelis-Menten kinetics. The reaction scheme is:\n$$ E + S \\underset{k_{-1}}{\\stackrel{k_1}{\\rightleftharpoons}} ES \\stackrel{k_{\\text{cat}}}{\\longrightarrow} E + P $$\nwhere $E$ is the free enzyme, $S$ is the substrate, $ES$ is the enzyme-substrate complex, and $P$ is the product. The rate constants for each step are $k_1$, $k_{-1}$, and $k_{\\text{cat}}$.\n\nThe total enzyme concentration $[E]_t$ is conserved:\n$$ [E]_t = [E] + [ES] $$\nUnder the quasi-steady-state assumption (QSSA), the concentration of the $ES$ complex is assumed to be constant, i.e., $d[ES]/dt \\approx 0$.\n$$ \\frac{d[ES]}{dt} = k_1 [E][S] - (k_{-1} + k_{\\text{cat}})[ES] = 0 $$\nFrom this, we have $k_1 [E][S] = (k_{-1} + k_{\\text{cat}})[ES]$. Defining the Michaelis constant as $K_m = (k_{-1} + k_{\\text{cat}})/k_1$, we can write $[E][S] = K_m[ES]$, or $[E] = K_m \\frac{[ES]}{[S]}$.\n\nSubstituting this expression for $[E]$ into the enzyme conservation equation:\n$$ [E]_t = K_m \\frac{[ES]}{[S]} + [ES] = [ES] \\left( \\frac{K_m}{[S]} + 1 \\right) = [ES] \\left( \\frac{K_m + [S]}{[S]} \\right) $$\nSolving for $[ES]$ gives:\n$$ [ES] = \\frac{[E]_t [S]}{K_m + [S]} $$\nThe initial rate of the reaction, $v_0$, is the rate of product formation, $v_0 = k_{\\text{cat}}[ES]$. Substituting the expression for $[ES]$:\n$$ v_0 = \\frac{k_{\\text{cat}}[E]_t [S]}{K_m + [S]} $$\nDefining the maximum possible rate as $V_{\\text{max}} = k_{\\text{cat}}[E]_t$, we arrive at the familiar Michaelis-Menten equation:\n$$ v_0 = \\frac{V_{\\text{max}}[S]}{K_m + [S]} $$\nNext, we consider the case of reversible competitive inhibition. The inhibitor, $I$, competes with the substrate for binding to the free enzyme, $E$. The additional equilibrium is:\n$$ E + I \\underset{k_{-i}}{\\stackrel{k_i}{\\rightleftharpoons}} EI $$\nThe dissociation constant for this equilibrium is the inhibition constant, $K_i = k_{-i}/k_i = \\frac{[E][I]}{[EI]}$. The inhibitor does not bind to the $ES$ complex.\n\nThe enzyme mass balance must now account for the enzyme-inhibitor complex, $EI$:\n$$ [E]_t = [E] + [ES] + [EI] $$\nUsing the definitions of $K_m$ and $K_i$, we can express $[E]$ and $[EI]$ in terms of $[ES]$:\nFrom the QSSA for $ES$, we still have $[E] = K_m \\frac{[ES]}{[S]}$.\nFrom the inhibitor equilibrium, we have $[EI] = \\frac{[E][I]}{K_i}$. Substituting the expression for $[E]$ gives $[EI] = \\frac{K_m[ES][I]}{K_i[S]}$.\n\nNow, we substitute these expressions for $[E]$ and $[EI]$ into the enzyme conservation equation:\n$$ [E]_t = K_m \\frac{[ES]}{[S]} + [ES] + \\frac{K_m[ES][I]}{K_i[S]} $$\nFactoring out $[ES]$:\n$$ [E]_t = [ES] \\left( \\frac{K_m}{[S]} + 1 + \\frac{K_m[I]}{K_i[S]} \\right) = [ES] \\left( \\frac{K_m(1 + [I]/K_i) + [S]}{[S]} \\right) $$\nSolving for $[ES]$:\n$$ [ES] = \\frac{[E]_t [S]}{K_m(1 + [I]/K_i) + [S]} $$\nThe inhibited initial rate, $v_i$, is still given by $v_i = k_{\\text{cat}}[ES]$ since the $ES$ complex is the only productive species:\n$$ v_i = \\frac{k_{\\text{cat}}[E]_t [S]}{K_m(1 + [I]/K_i) + [S]} = \\frac{V_{\\text{max}}[S]}{K_m(1 + [I]/K_i) + [S]} $$\nThis equation shows that competitive inhibition increases the apparent Michaelis constant to $K_{m, \\text{app}} = K_m(1 + [I]/K_i)$ but does not affect $V_{\\text{max}}$.\n\nNow we can derive the expression for fractional inhibition, $F$:\n$$ F = 1 - \\frac{v_i}{v_0} $$\nThe ratio $v_i/v_0$ is:\n$$ \\frac{v_i}{v_0} = \\frac{\\frac{V_{\\text{max}}[S]}{K_m(1 + [I]/K_i) + [S]}}{\\frac{V_{\\text{max}}[S]}{K_m + [S]}} = \\frac{K_m + [S]}{K_m(1 + [I]/K_i) + [S]} $$\nSubstituting this ratio into the expression for $F$:\n$$ F = 1 - \\frac{K_m + [S]}{K_m(1 + [I]/K_i) + [S]} = \\frac{(K_m(1 + [I]/K_i) + [S]) - (K_m + [S])}{K_m(1 + [I]/K_i) + [S]} $$\nSimplifying the numerator:\n$$ K_m + K_m\\frac{[I]}{K_i} + [S] - K_m - [S] = K_m\\frac{[I]}{K_i} $$\nSo the expression for $F$ becomes:\n$$ F = \\frac{K_m \\frac{[I]}{K_i}}{K_m(1 + \\frac{[I]}{K_i}) + [S]} = \\frac{K_m \\frac{[I]}{K_i}}{K_m + K_m \\frac{[I]}{K_i} + [S]} $$\nDividing the numerator and denominator by $K_m$ provides a more intuitive form:\n$$ F = \\frac{\\frac{[I]}{K_i}}{1 + \\frac{[S]}{K_m} + \\frac{[I]}{K_i}} $$\nThis derived expression shows that the fractional inhibition depends on the substrate concentration relative to its affinity for the enzyme ($[S]/K_m$) and the inhibitor concentration relative to its affinity for the enzyme ($[I]/K_i$).\n\nFinally, we compute the value of $F$ using the provided data:\nSubstrate concentration: $[S] = 0.20\\,\\mathrm{mM}$\nInhibitor concentration: $[I] = 0.50\\,\\mathrm{mM}$\nMichaelis constant: $K_m = 0.20\\,\\mathrm{mM}$\nInhibition constant: $K_i = 50\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}$\n\nIt is essential to use consistent units.

To quantify risk and guide management, you are asked to compute the cumulative weekly effective ultraviolet dose (erythemally weighted radiant exposure per area) delivered to the malar region over one week, using a simple model grounded in photobiological definitions.\n\nUse the following foundational facts:\n- The International Commission on Illumination (CIE) defines the Ultraviolet Index (UVI) such that the CIE erythemally weighted irradiance $E_{\\mathrm{ery}}$ in $\\mathrm{W}/\\mathrm{m}^{2}$ is related to the ambient Ultraviolet Index (UVI) by $E_{\\mathrm{ery}} = \\mathrm{UVI}/40$.\n- Radiant exposure (dose per unit area) $H$ is defined as $H = \\int E\\, dt$, where $E$ is the irradiance incident on the skin and $t$ is time.\n- In the simple irradiance model for facial melasma risk used here, the irradiance reaching the malar skin is attenuated multiplicatively by three factors: a geometric orientation factor $g$ (fraction of ambient horizontal irradiance received by the malar surface), a shading factor $s$ (fraction transmitted under hat or shade), and a sunscreen factor $a$ (fraction transmitted through sunscreen). For this patient, take $g=0.6$ for all exposures. For sunscreen, use the Sun Protection Factor (SPF) definition from photoprotection practice and model transmission as $a=1/\\mathrm{SPF}$ whenever sunscreen is present.\n\nAssume the ambient Ultraviolet Index (UVI) is constant over each stated exposure interval, and that the erythemal weighting intrinsic to UVI suffices for estimating melasma-relevant ultraviolet burden in this simplified model. The patient’s weekly outdoor exposures are:\n\n- Monday:\n  - $25$ minutes at $\\mathrm{UVI}=6$ with a brimmed hat ($s=0.7$) and sunscreen $\\mathrm{SPF}=50$.\n  - $15$ minutes at $\\mathrm{UVI}=3$ with a brimmed hat ($s=0.7$) and sunscreen $\\mathrm{SPF}=50$.\n- Tuesday:\n  - $40$ minutes at $\\mathrm{UVI}=9$ with a brimmed hat ($s=0.7$) and sunscreen $\\mathrm{SPF}=50$.\n- Wednesday:\n  - $20$ minutes at $\\mathrm{UVI}=8$ with a brimmed hat ($s=0.7$) and sunscreen $\\mathrm{SPF}=50$.\n  - $30$ minutes at $\\mathrm{UVI}=5$ with a brimmed hat ($s=0.7$) and sunscreen $\\mathrm{SPF}=50$.\n- Thursday:\n  - $15$ minutes at $\\mathrm{UVI}=4$ with no hat ($s=1$) and sunscreen $\\mathrm{SPF}=50$.\n  - $15$ minutes at $\\mathrm{UVI}=7$ with no hat ($s=1$) and sunscreen $\\mathrm{SPF}=50$.\n- Friday:\n  - $30$ minutes at $\\mathrm{UVI}=10$ with no hat ($s=1$) and sunscreen $\\mathrm{SPF}=50$.\n  - $30$ minutes at $\\mathrm{UVI}=10$ with no hat ($s=1$); sunscreen partially washed off, effectively $\\mathrm{SPF}=25$ for this interval.\n- Saturday:\n  - $90$ minutes at $\\mathrm{UVI}=5$ with a deeper brim/shade ($s=0.6$) and sunscreen $\\mathrm{SPF}=50$.\n- Sunday:\n  - $120$ minutes at $\\mathrm{UVI}=8$ under tree shade ($s=0.5$) and sunscreen $\\mathrm{SPF}=50$.\n\nCompute the cumulative weekly effective ultraviolet dose to the malar region in $\\mathrm{J}/\\mathrm{m}^{2}$ by summing the radiant exposures across all intervals.

It is a weighted sum of scores from four facial regions: Forehead ($F$), Right Malar ($MR$), Left Malar ($ML$), and Chin ($C$).
