While the underlying biomechanics are complex, planning often starts with simplified linear dose-response models that provide a reliable first approximation.

            "problem": "A patient with constant horizontal strabismus is scheduled for unilateral surgery combining a recession of the Lateral Rectus (LR) muscle and a resection of the Medial Rectus (MR) muscle on the same eye. In primary position gaze, alignment is quantified using the prism diopter (PD), where $1$ prism diopter is defined as a displacement of $1$ $\\mathrm{cm}$ at a viewing distance of $1$ $\\mathrm{m}$. For small ocular deviations in primary position, clinical practice uses a linear dose-response approximation: the change in alignment in PD produced by extraocular muscle surgery is proportional to the surgical displacement in millimeters and depends on which muscle is operated and whether it is recessed (weakened) or resected (strengthened). Assume the following well-tested dose-response facts for adult horizontal rectus muscles in primary position under standard surgical technique:\n- An LR recession produces a change in alignment of $2$ $\\mathrm{PD/mm}$ per millimeter of recession.\n- An MR resection produces a change in alignment of $3$ $\\mathrm{PD/mm}$ per millimeter of resection.\n\nAdopt the sign convention that exotropia is positive and esotropia is negative, and that a change toward esotropia is negative. The planned surgery consists of a $6$ $\\mathrm{mm}$ LR recession and a $5$ $\\mathrm{mm}$ MR resection performed on the same eye. Using the linear dose-response approximation and assuming independent additive effects in primary position, calculate the expected net change in primary position alignment. Express the final answer as a single real-valued number in prism diopters, following the stated sign convention, and do not include units in your final numeric answer. No rounding is required because the result is exact under the given assumptions.",

The dose-response values and surgical amounts are within realistic clinical ranges. The concept of prism diopters is correctly defined. The model is a valid first-order approximation used in practice.\n- **Well-Posed**: The problem is well-posed. It provides all necessary data and assumptions (surgical amounts, dose-response coefficients, additivity) to calculate a unique solution.\n- **Objective**: The problem is stated using clear, objective, and standard terminology from ophthalmology. The sign convention is explicitly defined, removing ambiguity.\n\nThe problem does not exhibit any flaws such as scientific unsoundness, missing information, contradiction, or ambiguity. It is a straightforward application of a defined model.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is deemed valid. A solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution\n\nThe net change in alignment, denoted as $\\Delta A_{total}$, is the sum of the individual changes produced by the Lateral Rectus (LR) recession and the Medial Rectus (MR) resection, based on the assumption of independent and additive effects.\n$$\n\\Delta A_{total} = \\Delta A_{LR} + \\Delta A_{MR}\n$$\nwhere $\\Delta A_{LR}$ is the change due to the LR recession and $\\Delta A_{MR}$ is the change due to the MR resection.\n\n$1$. **Calculate the change from the LR recession ($\\Delta A_{LR}$):**\nThe Lateral Rectus muscle is an abductor; its contraction moves the eye outward (temporally). A recession is a weakening procedure. Weakening an abductor muscle results in a reduced outward pull, causing the eye's resting position to shift inward (nasally). This is a shift toward esotropia.\n\nAccording to the given sign convention, a change toward esotropia is negative. Therefore, the change in alignment $\\Delta A_{LR}$ will have a negative sign.\n\nThe magnitude of the change is the product of the surgical amount and the corresponding dose-response coefficient.\nLet $S_{LR}$ be the amount of the LR recession and $C_{LR}$ be the dose-response coefficient for an LR recession.\n- $S_{LR} = 6 \\mathrm{mm}$\n- $C_{LR} = 2 \\mathrm{PD/mm}$\n\nThe change in alignment is:\n$$\n\\Delta A_{LR} = - (S_{LR} \\times C_{LR})\n$$\n$$\n\\Delta A_{LR} = - (6 \\mathrm{mm} \\times 2 \\frac{\\mathrm{PD}}{\\mathrm{mm}}) = -12 \\mathrm{PD}\n$$\n\n$2$. **Calculate the change from the MR resection ($\\Delta A_{MR}$):**\nThe Medial Rectus muscle is an adductor; its contraction moves the eye inward (nasally). A resection is a strengthening procedure. Strengthening an adductor muscle increases its inward pull, causing the eye's position to shift further inward. This is also a shift toward esotropia.\n\nAccording to the sign convention, this change, $\\Delta A_{MR}$, must also be negative.\n\nThe magnitude of the change is the product of the surgical amount and the dose-response coefficient.\nLet $S_{MR}$ be the amount of the MR resection and $C_{MR}$ be the dose-response coefficient for an MR resection.\n- $S_{MR} = 5 \\mathrm{mm}$\n- $C_{MR} = 3 \\mathrm{PD/mm}$\n\nThe change in alignment is:\n$$\n\\Delta A_{MR} = - (S_{MR} \\times C_{MR})\n$$\n$$\n\\Delta A_{MR} = - (5 \\mathrm{mm} \\times 3 \\frac{\\mathrm{PD}}{\\mathrm{mm}}) = -15 \\mathrm{PD}\n$$\n\n$3$. **Calculate the net change in alignment ($\\Delta A_{total}$):**\nThe total change is the sum of the individual changes.\n$$\n\\Delta A_{total} = \\Delta A_{LR} + \\Delta A_{MR}\n$$\n$$\n\\Delta A_{total} = (-12 \\mathrm{PD}) + (-15 \\mathrm{PD}) = -27 \\mathrm{PD}\n$$\n\nThe expected net change in primary position alignment is $-27$ prism diopters. The negative sign indicates a net shift toward esotropia, which is consistent with the physiological effects of both a lateral rectus recession and a medial rectus resection on the same eye.",

            "problem": "A patient with comitant esotropia demonstrates a baseline distance deviation of $25$ Prism Diopters (PD). During a standardized prism adaptation test using base-out prisms that initially neutralize diplopia, sustained wear for $60$ minutes increases the measured esodeviation to $35$ PD. The surgical plan is bilateral symmetric medial rectus recession. Assume the following clinically well-tested relationships as your fundamental base:\n\n- Prism Diopters (PD) quantify ocular misalignment linearly in primary position over the small-angle range relevant to routine strabismus surgery.\n- In the primary position near small to moderate angles, extraocular muscle actions can be locally approximated by a linear length-tension model, and bilateral symmetric medial rectus recession produces a roughly linear dose-response: the net change in primary position deviation, $\\Delta \\theta$ (in PD), is proportional to the total sum of recessions across both medial rectus muscles, $d_{\\text{sum}}$ (in millimeters), i.e., $\\Delta \\theta = \\beta\\, d_{\\text{sum}}$, where $\\beta$ is a constant over this operating range.\n- For bilateral medial rectus recession in typical adult comitant esotropia, a widely accepted dose-response coefficient is $\\beta = 2.7$ PD per millimeter of summed recession across both eyes.\n\nUsing only these bases, compute how the prism adaptation outcome should change the planned surgical dose per eye.

            "solution": "The problem is assessed to be valid as it is scientifically grounded in the principles of ophthalmology and oculomotor physiology, is well-posed with sufficient and consistent data, and is expressed objectively.\n\nThe problem requires two distinct components: a quantitative calculation of the change in surgical dose and a qualitative justification for the surgical strategy based on first principles.\n\nPart 1: Calculation of Incremental Surgical Dose\n\nThe problem provides a linear dose-response model for bilateral symmetric medial rectus recession:\n$$\n\\theta = \\beta \\, d_{\\text{sum}}\n$$\nwhere $\\theta$ is the magnitude of the esodeviation corrected (in Prism Diopters, PD), $d_{\\text{sum}}$ is the total sum of the recession performed on both medial rectus muscles (in millimeters, mm), and $\\beta$ is the dose-response coefficient. The goal of the surgery is to reduce the deviation to $0$, so the target correction $\\Delta \\theta$ is equal to the measured deviation $\\theta$.\n\nThe provided data are:\n-   Baseline esodeviation: $\\theta_{\\text{baseline}} = 25$ PD.\n-   Prism-adapted esodeviation: $\\theta_{\\text{adapted}} = 35$ PD.\n-   Dose-response coefficient: $\\beta = 2.7 \\, \\text{PD/mm}$.\n\nFirst, we calculate the total surgical dose (summed recession across both eyes) required to correct the baseline deviation, $d_{\\text{sum, baseline}}$.\n$$\nd_{\\text{sum, baseline}} = \\frac{\\theta_{\\text{baseline}}}{\\beta}\n$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$\nd_{\\text{sum, baseline}} = \\frac{25}{2.7} \\, \\text{mm}\n$$\nNext, we calculate the total surgical dose required to correct the prism-adapted deviation, $d_{\\text{sum, adapted}}$.\n$$\nd_{\\text{sum, adapted}} = \\frac{\\theta_{\\text{adapted}}}{\\beta}\n$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$\nd_{\\text{sum, adapted}} = \\frac{35}{2.7} \\, \\text{mm}\n$$\nThe problem asks for the incremental increase in the recession *per eye*, denoted as $\\Delta d_{\\text{eye}}$. The surgery is specified as bilateral and symmetric, which means the total recession, $d_{\\text{sum}}$, is divided equally between the two eyes. Let $d_{\\text{eye}}$ be the recession for a single eye.\n$$\nd_{\\text{sum}} = 2 \\cdot d_{\\text{eye}}\n$$\nTherefore, the recession per eye based on the baseline angle is:\n$$\nd_{\\text{eye, baseline}} = \\frac{d_{\\text{sum, baseline}}}{2} = \\frac{1}{2} \\left( \\frac{\\theta_{\\text{baseline}}}{\\beta} \\right)\n$$\nAnd the recession per eye based on the adapted angle is:\n$$\nd_{\\text{eye, adapted}} = \\frac{d_{\\text{sum, adapted}}}{2} = \\frac{1}{2} \\left( \\frac{\\theta_{\\text{adapted}}}{\\beta} \\right)\n$$\nThe incremental increase in the recession per eye, $\\Delta d_{\\text{eye}}$, is the difference between these two quantities:\n$$\n\\Delta d_{\\text{eye}} = d_{\\text{eye, adapted}} - d_{\\text{eye, baseline}}\n$$\n$$\n\\Delta d_{\\text{eye}} = \\frac{1}{2} \\left( \\frac{\\theta_{\\text{adapted}}}{\\beta} \\right) - \\frac{1}{2} \\left( \\frac{\\theta_{\\text{baseline}}}{\\beta} \\right)\n$$\nFactoring out the common terms:\n$$\n\\Delta d_{\\text{eye}} = \\frac{1}{2 \\beta} (\\theta_{\\text{adapted}} - \\theta_{\\text{baseline}})\n$$\nNow, we can substitute the numerical values into this final expression. The difference in deviation is $\\theta_{\\text{adapted}} - \\theta_{\\text{baseline}} = 35 \\, \\text{PD} - 25 \\, \\text{PD} = 10 \\, \\text{PD}$.\n$$\n\\Delta d_{\\text{eye}} = \\frac{1}{2 \\cdot 2.7} (10) = \\frac{10}{5.4} = \\frac{5}{2.7} \\, \\text{mm}\n$$\nCalculating the numerical value:\n$$\n\\Delta d_{\\text{eye}} \\approx 1.85185... \\, \\text{mm}\n$$\nRounding to three significant figures as required by the problem statement, we get:\n$$\n\\Delta d_{\\text{eye}} \\approx 1.85 \\, \\text{mm}\n$$\n\nPart 2: Justification for Targeting the Prism-Adapted Angle\n\nThe justification for using the prism-adapted angle as the surgical target stems from the fundamental principles of binocular motor control and sensory fusion.\n\nThe human visual system is designed to maintain single binocular vision by aligning the foveae of both eyes on a target of interest. This alignment is achieved by the oculomotor system through vergence movements (convergence and divergence). The brain possesses a feedback control mechanism, known as motor fusion, that actively adjusts eye alignment to compensate for small misalignments and maintain a single fused image.\n\nIn a patient with esotropia, there is an inward turn of one eye relative to the other. The baseline measurement of this deviation (e.g., $25$ PD) represents the manifest angle when fusional mechanisms are dissociated or relaxed. However, this measurement may not represent the total underlying neurological and anatomical drive causing the misalignment. The oculomotor system can possess a tonic adaptation level, often referred to as \"vergence adaptation\" or changes in the \"tonic vergence set-point\".\n\nThe prism adaptation test (PAT) is a diagnostic procedure designed to unmask this latent component of the deviation. When base-out prisms are placed before the eyes of an esotropic patient, they displace the visual image nasally, forcing the eyes to diverge to regain fusion. Initially, a prism of magnitude equal to the baseline deviation ($25$ PD) will optically neutralize the misalignment, allowing for binocular vision.\n\nHowever, the continued wear of these prisms for a sustained period (e.g., $60$ minutes) challenges the motor control system. If there is a strong, underlying drive for convergence that is not fully captured by the baseline measurement, the system adapts. The brain's vergence control center gradually increases its tonic convergence output to counteract the divergent stimulus of the prisms. This process is often described as the motor system \"eating up the prism\". The system essentially recalibrates its zero-point, revealing a greater innate tendency toward esodeviation.\n\nWhen the prisms are removed after the adaptation period, this newly increased tonic convergence is unmasked. The measured deviation is now larger ($35$ PD) than the baseline ($25$ PD). The difference ($10$ PD) represents the latent component of the esotropia that was revealed by the test.\n\nSurgery on the extraocular muscles is a static, anatomical alteration intended to permanently change the resting position of the eyes. Its goal is to create a new mechanical equilibrium that aligns with the brain's desired functional state of zero vergence error (i.e., straight eyes in primary position). If the surgery only addresses the baseline deviation ($25$ PD), it fails to account for the latent, adapted component ($10$ PD). Post-surgically, this uncorrected latent deviation is highly likely to manifest as a residual esotropia, leading to an undercorrection and a failed surgical outcome.\n\nTherefore, from first principles, the prism-adapted angle ($35$ PD) provides a more accurate measure of the total, stable motor deviation that the surgical intervention must correct. Targeting the adapted angle accounts for both the manifest and the latent components of the strabismus, thereby increasing the probability of achieving a stable, long-term alignment and successful binocular vision.",

            "solution": "The problem statement describes a patient with a chronic right sixth nerve (abducens) palsy, and asks for the most appropriate surgical plan based on fundamental principles of oculomotor physiology.\n\n**Step 1: Validation of the Problem Statement**\n\nFirst, I shall extract the givens and validate the problem statement.\n\n**Givens:**\n*   **Patient Profile:** A $42$-year-old patient.\n*   **Symptoms & Signs:** Binocular diplopia worse in right gaze; compensatory head turn to the right.\n*   **Ocular Alignment (Cover Test):**\n    *   An incomitant esotropia.\n    *   Primary position: $25$ prism diopters (PD).\n    *   Right gaze: $35$ PD.\n    *   Left gaze: $15$ PD.\n*   **Hess Chart Findings:**\n    *   Right eye: reduced excursion in abduction (underaction of right lateral rectus, LR); increased excursion in adduction (overaction of right medial rectus, MR).\n    *   Left eye: relative expansion in right gaze, indicating increased innervation to the yoke muscle (left MR).\n*   **Intraoperative Test Findings:**\n    *   Forced duction test: positive for tightness of the right MR.\n    *   Force generation test: diminished force in the right LR.\n*   **Ancillary Findings:** No significant vertical deviation; clinically negligible torsion.\n*   **Theoretical Framework:**\n    *   Hering’s law of equal innervation.\n    *   Sherrington’s law of reciprocal innervation.\n    *   Length–tension adaptation of extraocular muscles (antagonist contracture).\n*   **Surgical Goals:**\n    1.  Correct the primary position deviation.\n    2.  Improve comitance across lateral gazes.\n    3.  Address the yoke-driven contralateral effects.\n\n**Validation:**\nThe problem is scientifically grounded. The clinical presentation is a classic and internally consistent depiction of a right sixth nerve paresis and its long-term sequelae. The diminished force generation in the right LR confirms the paresis. The positive forced duction test confirms the secondary contracture of the ipsilateral antagonist (right MR), a result of length-tension adaptation. The incomitant pattern of esotropia (greatest in the field of action of the paretic muscle) and the contralateral Hess chart findings (overaction of the yoke muscle, the left MR) are direct consequences of Hering's law. The problem is well-posed, objective, and provides all necessary information to construct a logical surgical plan based on the stated principles. It is a valid, well-structured problem in clinical reasoning within ophthalmology.\n\n**Step 2: Derivation of the Surgical Plan from First Principles**\n\nThe patient's condition can be deconstructed into three key pathophysiological components, each requiring a specific surgical intervention.\n\n1.  **Ipsilateral Agonist Paresis:** The right LR is weak (\"diminished force\"). This is the primary defect. A surgical procedure must augment the force of this muscle. The standard procedure to strengthen a rectus muscle is a **resection**, which involves shortening the muscle tendon, thereby increasing its passive tension and rotational effect for a given level of innervation. Therefore, a **right LR resection** is indicated.\n\n2.  **Ipsilateral Antagonist Contracture:** Due to the unopposed action of the right MR and its chronic state of relative shortening (as the eye is deviated medially), the muscle has undergone structural changes leading to contracture (\"tightness\" on forced duction). This contracture acts as a restrictive leash, mechanically preventing the eye from abducting, and contributes significantly to the primary position esotropia of $25$ PD. To relieve this restriction, the right MR must be weakened. The standard procedure is a **recession**, where the muscle's insertion is moved posteriorly on the globe, reducing its mechanical advantage and lengthening it. Therefore, a **right MR recession** is indicated. The combination of a right MR recession and right LR resection (a \"recess-resect\" procedure) is a powerful tool to correct the strabismus in the paretic eye.\n\n3.  **Contralateral Yoke Overaction:** To attempt to abduct the paretic right eye (i.e., look to the right), the central nervous system sends an abnormally high amount of innervation. According to Hering's law, this same high level of innervation is sent to the yoke muscle for right gaze, which is the left MR. The healthy left MR responds vigorously to this excessive signal, resulting in a marked over-adduction of the left eye. This is the cause of the large increase in esotropia in right gaze (to $35$ PD) and the expansion of the left eye's field on the Hess chart. To improve comitance and reduce the diplopia in right gaze, this overaction must be addressed. A standard recession of the left MR would weaken it in all positions of gaze, which could disrupt alignment in primary position and left gaze. A more targeted approach is needed. The **posterior fixation suture (Faden procedure)** is specifically designed for this purpose. By suturing the muscle belly to the sclera posterior to the equator, it selectively weakens the muscle's rotational effect in its field of action (adduction) while having minimal effect in the primary position. Therefore, a **left MR posterior fixation suture** is indicated to dampen the yoke overaction.\n\n**Synthesized Plan:** The ideal surgical plan that addresses all three components of the pathophysiology and meets all three surgical goals is a combination of:\n1.  Right MR recession.\n2.  Right LR resection.\n3.  Left MR posterior fixation.\n\n**Step 3: Evaluation of Provided Options**\n\n*   **A. Right MR recession combined with right LR resection, plus contralateral left MR posterior fixation (Faden) to dampen yoke overaction in left MR during right gaze.**\n    This option precisely matches the comprehensive plan derived from first principles. The right MR recession addresses the antagonist contracture. The right LR resection augments the paretic agonist. The contralateral left MR posterior fixation directly targets the secondary yoke overaction as dictated by Hering's law. This plan addresses the primary deviation, the incomitance, and the contralateral effects.\n    **Verdict: Correct.**\n\n*   **B. Right MR recession alone, targeted to relieve contracture and reduce primary position esotropia without addressing contralateral yoke dynamics.**\n    This plan is incomplete. While a right MR recession is necessary to release the contracture, it fails to augment the primarily weak right LR. Furthermore, it explicitly states that it does *not* address the contralateral yoke dynamics, thereby failing to meet one of the key surgical goals. A recession alone would be insufficient to correct the abduction deficit and the large incomitance.\n    **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n*   **C. Full-tendon vertical rectus transposition (superior and inferior rectus) to right LR with simultaneous botulinum toxin injection to right MR; no contralateral surgery.**\n    A vertical rectus transposition (VRT) is a powerful procedure, but it is typically reserved for cases of complete paralysis (i.e., zero force generation) of the LR. The problem states \"diminished force,\" which implies a paresis (weakness), for which a recess-resect procedure is the more conventional and graded approach. More importantly, this option includes \"no contralateral surgery,\" and thus completely fails to address the significant yoke overaction in the left eye, a specific requirement of the problem.\n    **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n*   **D. Contralateral left LR resection and left MR recession to neutralize yoke overaction; defer ipsilateral surgery to avoid postoperative incomitance.**\n    This option proposes surgery only on the sound, contralateral eye. The proposed combination of left LR resection and left MR recession is physiologically unsound for this condition. A left MR recession would weaken the overacting yoke, which is logical. However, a left LR *resection* would strengthen abduction of the left eye, creating a new or worsening an existing exodeviation in left gaze, which is the opposite of the desired effect. To make the sound eye's movements match the paretic eye's limited movements, one might recess both the left MR and the left LR, not resect the LR. Furthermore, deferring ipsilateral surgery leaves the primary pathology—the weak LR and the tight, contracted MR—uncorrected. This fails to improve the abduction deficit of the right eye and ignores the mechanical restriction.\n    **Verdict: Incorrect.**",
