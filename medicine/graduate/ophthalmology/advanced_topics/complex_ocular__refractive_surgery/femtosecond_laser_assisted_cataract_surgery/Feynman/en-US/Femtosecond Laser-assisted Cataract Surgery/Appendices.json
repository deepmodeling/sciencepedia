This process is not governed by energy ($E$) alone, but by how that energy is concentrated in space and time.

Assume the focal energy density is uniform over a circular spot of radius $r$ (top-hat spatial profile) and the temporal envelope is rectangular with duration $\\tau$ (top-hat temporal profile). Use only the foundational definitions that fluence is energy per unit area and intensity is power per unit area, with power equal to energy divided by duration for a top-hat pulse.\n\nA pulse with energy $E = 3~\\mu\\text{J}$ is focused to a spot with radius $r = 3~\\mu\\text{m}$ and has duration $\\tau = 500~\\text{fs}$.

Round all reported values to three significant figures. Provide your final numerical results as two entries in a single row, in the order [fluence, peak intensity].",
            "solution": "The problem requires the calculation of two quantities: the fluence $F$ and the peak intensity $I$ of a laser pulse at the focal spot. The following data are provided:\n- Pulse energy: $E = 3~\\mu\\text{J}$\n- Focal spot radius: $r = 3~\\mu\\text{m}$\n- Pulse duration: $\\tau = 500~\\text{fs}$\n\nThe problem specifies a top-hat (uniform) spatial profile and a top-hat (rectangular) temporal profile. We are to use the fundamental definitions that fluence is energy per unit area and intensity is power per unit area.\n\nFirst, we calculate the fluence, $F$. The definition of fluence is given by:\n$$F = \\frac{E}{A}$$\nwhere $E$ is the energy and $A$ is the area over which the energy is deposited. The focal spot is circular with radius $r$, so its area is $A = \\pi r^2$.\n\nThe problem requires the fluence to be in units of $\\text{J}/\\text{cm}^{2}$. It is therefore expedient to convert the given quantities into a compatible system of units. The energy is $E = 3~\\mu\\text{J}$, which is $E = 3 \\times 10^{-6}~\\text{J}$. The radius is $r = 3~\\mu\\text{m}$. To convert this to centimeters, we use the conversion factor $1~\\mu\\text{m} = 10^{-4}~\\text{cm}$.\n$$r = 3~\\mu\\text{m} = 3 \\times 10^{-4}~\\text{cm}$$\nNow, we can calculate the area $A$ in $\\text{cm}^2$:\n$$A = \\pi r^2 = \\pi (3 \\times 10^{-4}~\\text{cm})^2 = \\pi (9 \\times 10^{-8}~\\text{cm}^2) = 9\\pi \\times 10^{-8}~\\text{cm}^2$$\nWe can now compute the fluence $F$:\n$$F = \\frac{E}{A} = \\frac{3 \\times 10^{-6}~\\text{J}}{9\\pi \\times 10^{-8}~\\text{cm}^2} = \\frac{3}{9\\pi} \\times 10^2~\\frac{\\text{J}}{\\text{cm}^2} = \\frac{100}{3\\pi}~\\frac{\\text{J}}{\\text{cm}^2}$$\nTo obtain a numerical value, we use the approximation for $\\pi$:\n$$F \\approx \\frac{100}{3 \\times 3.14159...} \\approx \\frac{100}{9.42477...} \\approx 10.61033~\\frac{\\text{J}}{\\text{cm}^2}$$\nRounding to three significant figures, the fluence is:\n$$F \\approx 10.6~\\frac{\\text{J}}{\\text{cm}^2}$$\n\nSecond, we calculate the peak intensity, $I$. The definition of intensity is power per unit area:\n$$I = \\frac{P}{A}$$\nFor a top-hat (rectangular) temporal profile of duration $\\tau$, the power $P$ is constant during the pulse and is given by the total energy $E$ divided by the duration $\\tau$. This constant intensity is the peak intensity.\n$$P = \\frac{E}{\\tau}$$\nThe pulse duration is given as $\\tau = 500~\\text{fs}$. We convert this to seconds using the conversion factor $1~\\text{fs} = 10^{-15}~\\text{s}$:\n$$\\tau = 500~\\text{fs} = 500 \\times 10^{-15}~\\text{s} = 5 \\times 10^{-13}~\\text{s}$$\nNow we calculate the power $P$:\n$$P = \\frac{3 \\times 10^{-6}~\\text{J}}{5 \\times 10^{-13}~\\text{s}} = 0.6 \\times 10^7~\\text{W} = 6 \\times 10^6~\\text{W}$$\nThe peak intensity $I$ is this power $P$ distributed over the area $A$. We use the area $A$ in units of $\\text{cm}^2$ as calculated previously, $A = 9\\pi \\times 10^{-8}~\\text{cm}^2$.\n$$I = \\frac{P}{A} = \\frac{6 \\times 10^6~\\text{W}}{9\\pi \\times 10^{-8}~\\text{cm}^2} = \\frac{6}{9\\pi} \\times 10^{14}~\\frac{\\text{W}}{\\text{cm}^2} = \\frac{2}{3\\pi} \\times 10^{14}~\\frac{\\text{W}}{\\text{cm}^2}$$\nAlternatively, one could note that for a top-hat pulse, $I = F/\\tau$. Using the unrounded value of $F$:\n$$I = \\frac{F}{\\tau} = \\frac{\\frac{100}{3\\pi}~\\frac{\\text{J}}{\\text{cm}^2}}{5 \\times 10^{-13}~\\text{s}} = \\frac{100}{15\\pi \\times 10^{-13}}~\\frac{\\text{W}}{\\text{cm}^2} = \\frac{20}{3\\pi} \\times 10^{13}~\\frac{\\text{W}}{\\text{cm}^2} = \\frac{2}{3\\pi} \\times 10^{14}~\\frac{\\text{W}}{\\text{cm}^2}$$\nThe two methods yield the same analytical expression, as expected. We now compute the numerical value:\n$$I \\approx \\frac{2 \\times 10^{14}}{3 \\times 3.14159...} \\approx \\frac{2 \\times 10^{14}}{9.42477...} \\approx 0.212206... \\times 10^{14}~\\frac{\\text{W}}{\\text{cm}^2}$$\nExpressing this in standard scientific notation and rounding to three significant figures:\n$$I \\approx 2.12 \\times 10^{13}~\\frac{\\text{W}}{\\text{cm}^2}$$\n\nThe final results, rounded to three significant figures, are a fluence of $10.6~\\text{J}/\\text{cm}^{2}$ and a peak intensity of $2.12 \\times 10^{13}~\\text{W}/\\text{cm}^{2}$.",
