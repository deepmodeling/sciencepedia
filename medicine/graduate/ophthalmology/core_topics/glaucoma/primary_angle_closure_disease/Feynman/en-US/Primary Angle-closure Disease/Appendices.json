            "problem": "A patient with primary angle-closure disease (PACD) presents with an acute reduction in trabecular outflow facility due to appositional closure of the anterior chamber angle. Assume steady-state aqueous humor dynamics, where net aqueous humor inflow equals outflow through the trabecular pathway, and that uveoscleral outflow remains constant and is already incorporated into the effective inflow. Let the intraocular pressure (IOP) be denoted by $P_0$, the episcleral venous pressure by $P_v$, the effective aqueous humor production rate by $F$, and the trabecular outflow facility by $C$. Before closure, the facility is $C_1 = 0.3$ $\\mu$L/min/mmHg; after closure, it is $C_2 = 0.15$ $\\mu$L/min/mmHg. The effective aqueous production remains $F = 2.5$ $\\mu$L/min, and the episcleral venous pressure remains $P_v = 10$ mmHg.\n\nUsing first principles of steady-state flow and the linear pressure–flow relationship through the trabecular pathway, determine the expected increase in intraocular pressure, defined as $\\Delta P_0 = P_{0,\\text{after}} - P_{0,\\text{before}}$.

            "solution": "The problem requires the determination of the increase in intraocular pressure, $\\Delta P_0$, resulting from an acute reduction in trabecular outflow facility. The analysis will be based on the principles of steady-state aqueous humor dynamics.\n\nThe fundamental relationship governing steady-state aqueous humor flow is given by the Goldmann equation. The problem statement specifies that the effective aqueous humor production rate, $F$, is equal to the outflow rate. This outflow occurs through the trabecular meshwork and is driven by the pressure gradient between the intraocular pressure, $P_0$, and the episcleral venous pressure, $P_v$. The trabecular outflow facility, $C$, is the constant of proportionality in this linear pressure-flow relationship. The equation is:\n$$F = C \\cdot (P_0 - P_v)$$\nHere, it is stated that uveoscleral outflow is constant and already incorporated into the effective inflow $F$, which simplifies the model to consider only the trabecular pathway for outflow response to pressure changes.\n\nTo find the intraocular pressure, $P_0$, we can rearrange the equation as follows:\n$$\\frac{F}{C} = P_0 - P_v$$\n$$P_0 = \\frac{F}{C} + P_v$$\n\nWe are given two states: before the angle-closure event and after. Let the intraocular pressure and outflow facility before the event be $P_{0,\\text{before}}$ and $C_1$, respectively. The intraocular pressure, $P_{0,\\text{before}}$, is then:\n$$P_{0,\\text{before}} = \\frac{F}{C_1} + P_v$$\n\nAfter the angle-closure event, the outflow facility is reduced to $C_2$, resulting in a new, higher intraocular pressure, $P_{0,\\text{after}}$. The effective aqueous production, $F$, and the episcleral venous pressure, $P_v$, are stated to remain constant.\n$$P_{0,\\text{after}} = \\frac{F}{C_2} + P_v$$\n\nThe problem asks for the increase in intraocular pressure, $\\Delta P_0$, which is the difference between the pressure after and before the event:\n$$\\Delta P_0 = P_{0,\\text{after}} - P_{0,\\text{before}}$$\nSubstituting the expressions for $P_{0,\\text{after}}$ and $P_{0,\\text{before}}$:\n$$\\Delta P_0 = \\left( \\frac{F}{C_2} + P_v \\right) - \\left( \\frac{F}{C_1} + P_v \\right)$$\nThe term $P_v$ cancels out:\n$$\\Delta P_0 = \\frac{F}{C_2} - \\frac{F}{C_1}$$\nFactoring out the constant flow rate $F$:\n$$\\Delta P_0 = F \\left( \\frac{1}{C_2} - \\frac{1}{C_1} \\right)$$\nThis is the symbolic expression for the increase in intraocular pressure.\n\nNow, we substitute the given numerical values into this expression:\n- Effective aqueous production rate, $F = 2.5$ $\\mu$L/min\n- Initial outflow facility, $C_1 = 0.3$ $\\mu$L/min/mmHg\n- Final outflow facility, $C_2 = 0.15$ $\\mu$L/min/mmHg\n\n$$\\Delta P_0 = 2.5 \\left( \\frac{1}{0.15} - \\frac{1}{0.3} \\right)$$\nThe units are consistent, and the resulting pressure will be in mmHg. Let's perform the calculation:\n$$\\frac{1}{0.15} = \\frac{1}{15/100} = \\frac{100}{15} = \\frac{20}{3}$$\n$$\\frac{1}{0.3} = \\frac{1}{3/10} = \\frac{10}{3}$$\nSubstituting these fractions back into the equation for $\\Delta P_0$:\n$$\\Delta P_0 = 2.5 \\left( \\frac{20}{3} - \\frac{10}{3} \\right)$$\n$$\\Delta P_0 = 2.5 \\left( \\frac{10}{3} \\right)$$\nWriting $2.5$ as a fraction $\\frac{5}{2}$:\n$$\\Delta P_0 = \\frac{5}{2} \\cdot \\frac{10}{3} = \\frac{50}{6} = \\frac{25}{3}$$\nAs a decimal, this is:\n$$\\Delta P_0 = 8.333... \\text{ mmHg}$$\nThe problem requires the final result to be rounded to three significant figures.\n$$\\Delta P_0 \\approx 8.33 \\text{ mmHg}$$",

            "solution": "The clinical presentation must be systematically analyzed to determine the diagnosis, mechanism, and appropriate management.\n\n1.  **Diagnosis:** The patient exhibits narrow angles on gonioscopy where the trabecular meshwork is visible for only $180^{\\circ}$, qualifying as an \"occludable angle.\" However, the baseline intraocular pressure (IOP) is normal ($16$ mmHg), there are no peripheral anterior synechiae (PAS), and there is no glaucomatous optic neuropathy (evidenced by healthy optic nerves and full visual fields). Based on these findings, the patient's condition is classified as **Primary Angle-Closure Suspect (PACS)**.\n\n2.  **Pathophysiological Mechanism:** The key to this case lies in the provocative test. The patient's symptoms (halos) and IOP rise to a pathological level ($24$ mmHg) occur in darkness. This is when the pupil dilates (mydriasis), increasing the contact between the posterior iris and the anterior lens. This impedes aqueous flow from the posterior to the anterior chamber, a mechanism known as **relative pupillary block**. The resulting pressure buildup in the posterior chamber causes the flexible iris to bow forward (iris bombé), which is directly confirmed by the AS-OCT finding of \"anterior bowing of the mid-peripheral iris.\" This forward bowing leads to appositional closure of the angle and the subsequent rise in IOP. The complete reversal of these signs with re-illumination confirms that pupillary block is the dominant, dynamic mechanism. Furthermore, the absence of a \"double-hump sign\" on indentation gonioscopy makes a primary plateau iris mechanism unlikely.\n\n3.  **Management Strategy:** The definitive treatment for relative pupillary block is a **Laser Peripheral Iridotomy (LPI)**. This procedure creates a small opening in the peripheral iris that bypasses the pupil, equalizing the pressure between the anterior and posterior chambers. This resolves the iris bombé and deepens the angle, preventing future IOP spikes and potential progression of the disease.\n\n**Analysis of Options:**\n\n*   **A. The findings indicate a pupillary block–predominant primary angle-closure suspect; recommend prophylactic Laser Peripheral Iridotomy (LPI) to eliminate relative pupillary block.** This option is correct.

The findings indicate plateau iris configuration...** This is incorrect. The clinical evidence points to pupillary block, not plateau iris.\n*   **C. This represents acute primary angle-closure glaucoma...** This is incorrect. The patient is not in an acute attack, which involves much higher IOP and severe symptoms.\n*   **D. This is physiological dark-room IOP fluctuation...** This is incorrect. The IOP rise is pathological and symptomatic, requiring intervention.\n*   **E. The most effective preventive strategy is primary clear-lens extraction...** This is incorrect.

            "problem": "A patient with suspected primary angle-closure disease presents after a confirmed patent Laser Peripheral Iridotomy (LPI). Anterior segment imaging shows a normal lens vault relative to the scleral spur plane. On gonioscopy at the slit lamp, the anterior chamber angle is narrow in room light and becomes appositionally open with gentle indentation. In a dark room without pharmacologic dilation, the angle closes appositionally again. Based on the core mechanisms of primary angle-closure disease—namely pupillary block, lens-induced crowding, and non-pupillary block mechanisms such as anteriorly positioned ciliary body (plateau iris)—use the following foundational facts to reason to the most likely mechanism and the most appropriate immediate next step(s): a patent LPI eliminates pressure differential across the iris from pupillary block by providing an alternative aqueous flow pathway; lens-induced crowding is typically associated with increased lens vault; indentation gonioscopy overcomes reversible appositional closure but not established peripheral anterior synechiae; and physiologic dark-room angle narrowing can unmask residual non-pupillary block angle closure. Which option best integrates these observations into a correct inference and next step?\n\nA. Plateau iris syndrome is likely; confirm with Ultrasound Biomicroscopy (UBM) or dark-room Anterior Segment Optical Coherence Tomography (AS-OCT) and proceed with Argon Laser Peripheral Iridoplasty (ALPI), with consideration of a low-dose miotic at night and counseling to avoid mydriatics.\n\nB.

            "solution": "### Derivation of Solution\n\nThe solution requires a systematic deduction of the underlying mechanism by integrating the clinical findings with the provided foundational facts.\n\n1.  **Analysis of Pupillary Block:** The patient has a \"confirmed patent $LPI$\". According to Fact 1, a patent $LPI$ \"eliminates pressure differential across the iris from pupillary block\". Therefore, pupillary block is not the cause of the ongoing angle closure. This is a critical first step in the differential diagnosis.\n\n2.  **Analysis of Lens-Induced Mechanism:** The problem states the patient has a \"normal lens vault\". According to Fact 2, \"lens-induced crowding is typically associated with increased lens vault\". Since this key sign is absent, a primary lens-induced mechanism is unlikely to be the dominant cause of the angle narrowing.\n\n3.  **Analysis of Synechial vs. Appositional Closure:** On gonioscopy, the angle \"becomes appositionally open with gentle indentation\". According to Fact 3, indentation overcomes \"reversible appositional closure but not established peripheral anterior synechiae ($PAS$)\". This finding definitively rules out the presence of extensive, fixed $PAS$ and confirms the closure is appositional (i.e., a temporary, reversible contact between the iris and the trabecular meshwork).\n\n4.  **Analysis of the Dynamic Angle Behavior:** The angle closes in a dark room. Dark-induced mydriasis (pupil dilation) causes the iris tissue to bunch up in the periphery. In most eyes, this is of no consequence. However, in this patient, it causes appositional closure. Since pupillary block has been ruled out, this points to a non-pupillary block mechanism. Fact 4 states that \"physiologic dark-room angle narrowing can unmask residual non-pupillary block angle closure\".\n\n5.  **Synthesis and Conclusion:** The patient exhibits persistent, appositional angle closure that occurs upon pupillary dilation (in the dark) despite the absence of pupillary block (due to the patent $LPI$) and the absence of a significant lens-induced component (normal lens vault). This clinical constellation is the classic definition of **plateau iris syndrome**. In this condition, an anatomic abnormality—anteriorly positioned ciliary processes—pushes the peripheral iris root forward and into the angle, causing it to close when the pupil dilates. The iris lays flatly from the pupil margin to the periphery, where it takes a sharp downward turn into the angle, creating a \"plateau\" appearance on imaging.\n\nThis deduction leads directly to the most appropriate diagnostic and therapeutic steps. The diagnosis of plateau iris configuration/syndrome must be confirmed with imaging that visualizes the ciliary body, such as Ultrasound Biomicroscopy ($UBM$) or dark-room Anterior Segment Optical Coherence Tomography ($AS-OCT$). The definitive treatment is Argon Laser Peripheral Iridoplasty ($ALPI$), which uses laser to contract the peripheral iris stroma, pulling it away from the angle. Ancillary management includes miotics (which constrict the pupil and pull the iris away from the angle) and avoidance of mydriatics.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n*   **A. Plateau iris syndrome is likely; confirm with Ultrasound Biomicroscopy (UBM) or dark-room Anterior Segment Optical Coherence Tomography (AS-OCT) and proceed with Argon Laser Peripheral Iridoplasty (ALPI), with consideration of a low-dose miotic at night and counseling to avoid mydriatics.**\n    *   This option correctly identifies plateau iris syndrome as the most likely diagnosis based on the clinical findings. It correctly proposes the standard confirmatory diagnostic tests ($UBM$ or $AS-OCT$) and the definitive treatment ($ALPI$). It also includes appropriate ancillary management (miotics and avoidance of mydriatics). This aligns perfectly with the derived solution.\n    *   **Verdict: Correct.**\n\n*   **B. Persistent pupillary block is likely; repeat LPI and avoid miotics because they may worsen angle closure in this setting.**\n    *   This option is incorrect. The inference of \"persistent pupillary block\" is directly contradicted by the given data of a \"confirmed patent $LPI$\". Repeating a patent $LPI$ is illogical. While miotics can paradoxically worsen angle closure in rare situations, they are a mainstay treatment for plateau iris, making this advice inappropriate for the likely diagnosis.\n    *   **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n*   **C. Lens-induced crowded angle is likely despite a normal lens vault; schedule clear lens extraction as the primary next step.**\n    *   This option is incorrect. It posits a lens-induced mechanism despite the \"normal lens vault\", which argues against it. While lens extraction is a valid treatment for angle closure, proposing it as the primary next step without confirming the diagnosis and in the face of contradictory evidence is overly aggressive and not standard practice for this presentation.\n    *   **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n*   **D. This is a physiologic variant of angle behavior; observation alone is appropriate without further diagnostic testing or intervention.**\n    *   This option is incorrect and dangerous. Appositional angle closure post-$LPI$ is a pathological state (primary angle-closure disease), not a benign physiologic variant. It carries a significant risk of developing pressure spikes and glaucomatous optic neuropathy. Observation alone is substandard care.\n    *   **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n*   **E. Extensive peripheral anterior synechiae are present; indentation opening is unreliable, and primary trabeculectomy is the next step.**\n    *   This option is incorrect. The inference of \"extensive peripheral anterior synechiae\" is directly contradicted by the gonioscopy finding that the angle opens with indentation. The closure is appositional, not synechial. Consequently, trabeculectomy, a surgery for advanced glaucoma often with extensive synechiae, is not indicated as a primary step.\n    *   **Verdict: Incorrect.**",
