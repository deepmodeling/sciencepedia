Landmark clinical trials have unequivocally demonstrated that intensive glycemic control significantly reduces the risk of developing and progressing to proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR). This exercise will help you quantify this relationship, translating broad epidemiological findings into a concrete risk calculation that underscores the profound impact of lowering a patient's Hemoglobin A1c ($HbA1c$) .",

            "problem": "A tertiary retina clinic is developing a risk model for Proliferative Diabetic Retinopathy (PDR) progression based on glycemic control. Consider the following well-tested epidemiologic observation grounded in large trials such as the Diabetes Control and Complications Trial (DCCT): for each absolute reduction of Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) by $1\\%$, the relative risk (RR) of incident or progressive PDR is reduced by $18\\%$. Assume the following modeling framework: (i) relative risk is defined as the ratio of the probability of PDR progression under a given exposure to that under a reference exposure; (ii) proportional effects across $1\\%$ HbA1c decrements are independent and multiplicative over multiple percentage-point changes; and (iii) within the HbA1c range considered, the per-$1\\%$ effect is constant. Normalize the baseline relative risk at HbA1c $9\\%$ to be $1$. If a patient’s HbA1c is lowered from $9\\%$ to $7\\%$, determine the expected relative risk at $7\\%$ HbA1c under this model.

            "introduction": "The hallmark of proliferative diabetic retinopathy is neovascularization, a direct consequence of retinal ischemia and the subsequent upregulation of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). This practice explores the quantitative link between the extent of retinal nonperfusion, measured as an ischemic index from fluorescein angiography, and the risk of developing neovascularization. By applying a simplified mechanistic framework based on receptor-ligand binding kinetics, you will model the switch-like biological response to increasing ischemic drive, providing a deeper, pathophysiological basis for risk stratification .

            "problem": "A person with long-standing diabetes mellitus underwent widefield fluorescein angiography (FA), revealing patchy capillary nonperfusion totaling $400$ disc areas over a total imaged retinal area of $1{,}600$ disc areas. The disc area is the area of the optic disc used as a unitless indexing standard for retinal area. In proliferative diabetic retinopathy, hypoxic retina drives production of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), which binds to endothelial receptors to promote neovascularization elsewhere (NVE). Assume the following mechanistic framework grounded in receptor-ligand binding:\n\n- The ischemic index $I$ is defined as the fraction of imaged retinal area that is nonperfused, $I = A_{\\mathrm{np}}/A_{\\mathrm{tot}}$, where $A_{\\mathrm{np}}$ is the nonperfusion area and $A_{\\mathrm{tot}}$ is the total imaged area.\n- The steady-state effective VEGF level is proportional to the ischemic index and is normalized so that the dimensionless ligand level is $[V] = I$.\n- Receptor occupancy follows a Hill-Langmuir relation with cooperativity, so that the fraction of occupied receptors is $f = \\dfrac{[V]^{n}}{[V]^{n} + K^{n}}$, with Hill coefficient $n = 4$ and half-occupancy constant $K = I_{50} = 0.20$ (dimensionless ischemic index at half-maximal occupancy).\n- In this simplified model, the instantaneous probability of NVE presence is proportional to receptor occupancy, and the proportionality is normalized to $p = f$.\n\nStarting from the above definitions and assumptions, compute the ischemic index $I$ and then use the receptor-occupancy framework to derive and calculate the estimated probability $p$ of NVE. Express the final probability as a decimal and round your answer to four significant figures. No units are required for the final numerical value.",
