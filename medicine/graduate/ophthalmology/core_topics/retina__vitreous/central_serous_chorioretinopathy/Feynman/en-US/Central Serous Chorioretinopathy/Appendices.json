            "problem": "A patient with chronic Central Serous Chorioretinopathy (CSC) is planned for verteporfin-mediated Photodynamic Therapy (PDT). Verteporfin labeling indicates a standard mass-based dose per Body Surface Area (BSA) of $6\\,\\text{mg}/\\text{m}^2$ for conditions such as neovascular age-related macular degeneration, but for CSC, a half-dose strategy is selected to minimize choriocapillaris hypoperfusion and retinal pigment epithelium stress. The patient’s BSA is measured at $1.90\\,\\text{m}^2$. The available verteporfin stock is supplied as $15\\,\\text{mg}/\\text{vial}$ at a concentration of $2\\,\\text{mg}/\\text{mL}$ after reconstitution.\n\nUsing only first principles of dose scaling to body surface area and the definition of solution concentration, derive the mass of verteporfin to administer for half-dose PDT and the corresponding volume to draw from the vial. Express the mass in $\\text{mg}$ and the volume in $\\text{mL}$. Round your final numerical results to three significant figures.

            "solution": "The problem is evaluated to be valid as it is scientifically grounded in pharmacological principles, well-posed with sufficient and consistent data, and objectively stated.\n\nThe solution is derived from two first principles: dose calculation based on body surface area, and the definition of solution concentration.\n\nFirst, we determine the total mass of verteporfin required for the patient. The prescribed dose is a function of the patient's Body Surface Area ($BSA$). The standard dose, $D_{std}$, is given as $6\\,\\text{mg}/\\text{m}^2$. For Central Serous Chorioretinopathy (CSC), a half-dose strategy is employed. Therefore, the specific dose for this procedure, $D_{CSC}$, is:\n$$\nD_{CSC} = \\frac{1}{2} D_{std} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 6\\,\\text{mg}/\\text{m}^2 = 3\\,\\text{mg}/\\text{m}^2\n$$\nThe total mass to be administered, $m_{admin}$, is the product of this specific dose and the patient's $BSA$. The patient's $BSA$ is given as $1.90\\,\\text{m}^2$.\n$$\nm_{admin} = D_{CSC} \\times BSA\n$$\nSubstituting the values:\n$$\nm_{admin} = (3\\,\\text{mg}/\\text{m}^2) \\times (1.90\\,\\text{m}^2) = 5.7\\,\\text{mg}\n$$\nThe problem requires the result to be rounded to three significant figures. The input value $1.90\\,\\text{m}^2$ has three significant figures, while $3\\,\\text{mg}/\\text{m}^2$ is derived from an exact factor of $\\frac{1}{2}$ and a standard dose of $6\\,\\text{mg}/\\text{m}^2$, which is treated here as a defined standard. Therefore, the result should be expressed with three significant figures.\n$$\nm_{admin} = 5.70\\,\\text{mg}\n$$\n\nSecond, we determine the volume of the reconstituted solution to draw. The relationship between mass ($m$), concentration ($C$), and volume ($V$) is given by the definition of concentration:\n$$\nC = \\frac{m}{V}\n$$\nWe need to find the volume, $V_{draw}$, that contains the required mass, $m_{admin}$. Rearranging the formula to solve for volume gives:\n$$\nV_{draw} = \\frac{m_{admin}}{C}\n$$\nThe concentration of the reconstituted verteporfin solution is given as $C = 2\\,\\text{mg}/\\text{mL}$. Using the calculated mass $m_{admin} = 5.70\\,\\text{mg}$:\n$$\nV_{draw} = \\frac{5.70\\,\\text{mg}}{2\\,\\text{mg}/\\text{mL}} = 2.85\\,\\text{mL}\n$$\nThis value already has three significant figures, consistent with the precision of the input data.\n\nThus, the required mass of verteporfin is $5.70\\,\\text{mg}$ and the corresponding volume to be drawn is $2.85\\,\\text{mL}$.",

            "solution": "The problem is valid. It is a well-posed application of Bayesian probability to a realistic clinical scenario in ophthalmology. It is scientifically grounded, objective, and contains all necessary information for a unique solution.\n\nWe are tasked with computing the post-test probability of a patient having Choroidal Neovascularization (CNV) given a positive Optical Coherence Tomography Angiography (OCTA) result. This is a classic application of Bayes' theorem.\n\nFirst, we define the events based on the problem statement:\n- Let $D$ be the event that the patient has CNV (the \"disease\").\n- Let $D^c$ be the event that the patient does not have CNV.\n- Let $T^+$ be the event that the OCTA test result is positive.\n- Let $T^-$ be the event that the OCTA test result is negative.\n\nNext, we formalize the given information using probabilistic notation:\n1.  The clinician's pretest probability for CNV is the prior probability of the event $D$.\n    $$P(D) = 0.30$$\n2.  The sensitivity of the OCTA test is the probability of a positive test result given that the patient has CNV.\n    $$P(T^+ | D) = 0.85$$\n3.  The specificity of the OCTA test is the probability of a negative test result given that the patient does not have CNV.\n    $$P(T^- | D^c) = 0.90$$\n\nOur objective is to calculate the post-test probability of CNV given a positive test result, which is the conditional probability $P(D | T^+)$.\n\nWe will use Bayes' theorem, which is stated as:\n$$P(D | T^+) = \\frac{P(T^+ | D) P(D)}{P(T^+)}$$\n\nThe denominator, $P(T^+)$, is the total probability of a positive test result. It can be calculated using the law of total probability, which considers both true positive and false positive scenarios:\n$$P(T^+) = P(T^+ | D) P(D) + P(T^+ | D^c) P(D^c)$$\n\nTo use this formula, we need to determine the values for $P(D^c)$ and $P(T^+ | D^c)$.\n\nThe probability of not having CNV, $P(D^c)$, is the complement of having CNV:\n$$P(D^c) = 1 - P(D) = 1 - 0.30 = 0.70$$\n\nThe probability of a positive test given that the patient does not have CNV, $P(T^+ | D^c)$, is the complement of the specificity. This is also known as the false positive rate.\n$$P(T^+ | D^c) = 1 - P(T^- | D^c) = 1 - 0.90 = 0.10$$\n\nNow we can substitute these values into the law of total probability to find $P(T^+)$:\n$$P(T^+) = (0.85)(0.30) + (0.10)(0.70)$$\n$$P(T^+) = 0.255 + 0.070$$\n$$P(T^+) = 0.325$$\n\nFinally, we substitute all the calculated and given values back into Bayes' theorem to find the post-test probability, $P(D | T^+)$:\n$$P(D | T^+) = \\frac{P(T^+ | D) P(D)}{P(T^+)}$$\n$$P(D | T^+) = \\frac{0.255}{0.325}$$\n\nPerforming the division:\n$$P(D | T^+) \\approx 0.78461538...$$\n\nThe problem requires the answer to be expressed as a decimal number rounded to four significant figures. Rounding the result gives:\n$$P(D | T^+) \\approx 0.7846$$\n\nTherefore, the post-test probability of the patient having CNV after a positive OCTA result is approximately $0.7846$.",

The derivation must begin from the fundamental definitions of statistical hypothesis testing and power.\n\nLet $\\mu_1$ and $\\mu_2$ be the true mean changes in Subretinal Fluid (SRF) height for the new intervention arm and the observation arm, respectively. Let $\\bar{X}_1$ and $\\bar{X}_2$ be the corresponding sample means from samples of size $n_1$ and $n_2$. The study is planned with equal allocation, so $n_1 = n_2 = n$.
