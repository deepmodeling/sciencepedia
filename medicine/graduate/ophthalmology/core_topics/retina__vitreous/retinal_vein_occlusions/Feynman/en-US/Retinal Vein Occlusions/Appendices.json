This exercise uses the Hagen-Poiseuille law to model the hemodynamic consequences of venous compression at an arteriovenous crossing, a common site for BRVOs.

            "problem": "A branch retinal vein occlusion (BRVO) commonly occurs at an arteriovenous crossing where the artery indents and compresses the vein, reducing its intraluminal radius. Consider a venous segment at such a crossing that can be idealized as a rigid, straight, cylindrical tube of fixed length $L$, carrying an incompressible Newtonian fluid (blood approximated under steady, low-Reynolds-number conditions). Assume steady laminar flow and that the effective dynamic viscosity $\\eta$ is unchanged before and after compression. Let the pre-compression radius be $r_{0}$ and the post-compression radius be $r_{1} = 0.8\\,r_{0}$, representing a $20\\%$ reduction in radius. Using the well-tested fluid dynamics for laminar flow in cylindrical vessels, derive the multiplicative change in hydraulic resistance at the crossing, defined as the ratio $R_{1}/R_{0}$, where $R_{0}$ is the resistance before compression and $R_{1}$ is the resistance after compression. Express your answer as a single exact fraction (dimensionless). Do not include any units. No rounding is required.",
            "solution": "The problem will first be validated for scientific soundness, self-consistency, and clarity before a solution is attempted.\n\n### Step 1: Extract Givens\n- **Context**: A branch retinal vein occlusion (BRVO) at an arteriovenous crossing.\n- **Model**: A venous segment idealized as a rigid, straight, cylindrical tube.\n- **Length**: The length of the tube, $L$, is fixed.\n- **Fluid**: The fluid is incompressible and Newtonian (blood approximated).\n- **Flow Conditions**: The flow is steady, laminar, and at a low-Reynolds-number.\n- **Viscosity**: The effective dynamic viscosity, $\\eta$, is constant.\n- **Pre-compression Radius**: The initial radius of the vein is $r_{0}$.\n- **Post-compression Radius**: The final radius of the vein is $r_{1} = 0.8\\,r_{0}$, representing a $20\\%$ reduction.\n- **Resistance**: Hydraulic resistance is defined as $R$. The resistance before compression is $R_{0}$ and after compression is $R_{1}$.\n- **Objective**: Derive the multiplicative change in hydraulic resistance, which is the ratio $R_{1}/R_{0}$.\n- **Required Format**: The answer must be a single exact, dimensionless fraction.\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\nThe problem is subjected to validation based on the established criteria.\n\n- **Scientifically Grounded**: The problem is grounded in the principles of fluid dynamics, specifically the Hagen-Poiseuille law for laminar flow in a cylindrical pipe. While blood is a complex non-Newtonian fluid, modeling it as a Newtonian fluid is a standard and valid approximation in many physiological contexts, especially for instructional purposes and when explicitly stated, as it is here. The scenario of venous compression causing increased resistance is a well-established pathophysiological mechanism in BRVO. Thus, the problem is scientifically sound.\n\n- **Well-Posed**: The problem is well-posed. It provides all necessary information: the relationship between the initial and final radii, and the constancy of length and viscosity. The objective is clearly defined as finding the ratio of resistances, which eliminates the need for the absolute values of $L$ and $\\eta$. A unique, stable, and meaningful solution exists.\n\n- **Objective**: The problem is stated in precise, objective language, free of subjective claims or ambiguity.\n\nThe problem does not exhibit any flaws such as scientific unsoundness, incompleteness, contradiction, or infeasibility. The model, while an idealization, is appropriate for a formal-analytical problem.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is deemed **valid**. A solution will now be derived.\n\n### Solution Derivation\nThe hydraulic resistance, $R$, of a vessel is defined as the ratio of the pressure drop, $\\Delta P$, across the vessel to the volumetric flow rate, $Q$, through it.\n$$ R = \\frac{\\Delta P}{Q} $$\nFor steady, laminar flow of an incompressible Newtonian fluid through a straight, rigid cylindrical tube of length $L$ and radius $r$, the relationship between these quantities is described by the Hagen-Poiseuille equation:\n$$ Q = \\frac{\\pi r^4 \\Delta P}{8 \\eta L} $$\nwhere $\\eta$ is the dynamic viscosity of the fluid.\n\nBy rearranging the Hagen-Poiseuille equation, we can express the hydraulic resistance $R$ in terms of the geometrical and fluid properties:\n$$ R = \\frac{\\Delta P}{Q} = \\frac{\\Delta P}{\\left(\\frac{\\pi r^4 \\Delta P}{8 \\eta L}\\right)} = \\frac{8 \\eta L}{\\pi r^4} $$\nThis equation shows that for a given fluid (constant $\\eta$) and vessel segment (constant $L$), the hydraulic resistance is inversely proportional to the fourth power of the radius:\n$$ R \\propto \\frac{1}{r^4} $$\nUsing this relationship, we can establish the expressions for the resistance before ($R_{0}$) and after ($R_{1}$) compression.\n\nThe resistance before compression, with radius $r_{0}$, is:\n$$ R_{0} = \\frac{8 \\eta L}{\\pi r_{0}^4} $$\nThe resistance after compression, with radius $r_{1}$, is:\n$$ R_{1} = \\frac{8 \\eta L}{\\pi r_{1}^4} $$\nWe are asked to find the multiplicative change in resistance, which is the ratio $R_{1}/R_{0}$.\n$$ \\frac{R_{1}}{R_{0}} = \\frac{\\left(\\frac{8 \\eta L}{\\pi r_{1}^4}\\right)}{\\left(\\frac{8 \\eta L}{\\pi r_{0}^4}\\right)} $$\nThe constants $8$, $\\eta$, $L$, and $\\pi$ are identical in the numerator and denominator, so they cancel out.\n$$ \\frac{R_{1}}{R_{0}} = \\frac{r_{0}^4}{r_{1}^4} = \\left(\\frac{r_{0}}{r_{1}}\\right)^4 $$\nThe problem provides the relationship between the post-compression radius $r_{1}$ and the pre-compression radius $r_{0}$:\n$$ r_{1} = 0.8 \\, r_{0} = \\frac{8}{10} \\, r_{0} = \\frac{4}{5} \\, r_{0} $$\nSubstituting this expression into the ratio equation:\n$$ \\frac{R_{1}}{R_{0}} = \\left(\\frac{r_{0}}{\\frac{4}{5} \\, r_{0}}\\right)^4 $$\nThe term $r_{0}$ cancels out, leaving a numerical ratio:\n$$ \\frac{R_{1}}{R_{0}} = \\left(\\frac{1}{\\frac{4}{5}}\\right)^4 = \\left(\\frac{5}{4}\\right)^4 $$\nTo express this as a single exact fraction, we compute the fourth power of the numerator and the denominator:\n$$ \\frac{R_{1}}{R_{0}} = \\frac{5^4}{4^4} = \\frac{625}{256} $$\nThus, a $20\\%$ reduction in radius leads to a multiplicative increase in hydraulic resistance by a factor of $625/256$.",

It is scientifically grounded within the standard framework of pharmacoeconomic analysis, well-posed with a complete and consistent set of data, and uses clear, objective language. The data provided are plausible for the clinical context described.\n\nThe objective is to compute the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of aflibercept relative to ranibizumab for the treatment of macular edema secondary to central retinal vein occlusion (CRVO). The ICER is defined as the ratio of the incremental cost to the incremental effectiveness of a new intervention compared to a standard one.\n\nLet the subscript 'A' denote aflibercept and 'R' denote ranibizumab.
