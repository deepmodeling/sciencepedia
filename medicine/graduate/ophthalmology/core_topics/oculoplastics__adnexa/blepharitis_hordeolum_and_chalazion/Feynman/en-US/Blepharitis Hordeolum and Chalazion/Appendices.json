            "problem": "A pragmatic randomized trial in an advanced oculoplastic clinic investigates whether adding warm compresses to eyelid hygiene reduces the recurrence of eyelid nodules in patients with chronic anterior blepharitis and meibomian gland dysfunction. The two nodular entities tracked are hordeolum (acute stye) and chalazion (chronic lipogranulomatous nodule), each attributed to obstructed meibomian glands and associated marginal blepharitis. The control arm receives standardized eyelid hygiene alone, and the intervention arm receives warm compresses plus the same standardized hygiene. Over a $6$-month follow-up, the absolute risk reduction (ARR) in recurrence, defined as the difference in recurrence probabilities between control and treatment arms, is measured to be $0.12$.\n\nStarting from the core definitions that (i) risk is a probability on the unit interval and (ii) Absolute Risk Reduction (ARR) is the difference in recurrence probabilities between control and treatment arms, and using the definition of the Number Needed to Treat (NNT) as the number of patients who must receive the intervention such that, in expectation, one recurrence is prevented, derive the relationship necessary to compute the NNT from the ARR and then compute the NNT for this study.\n\nExpress the final NNT as an exact fraction.

It is scientifically grounded in established principles of biostatistics and evidence-based medicine, is well-posed with sufficient and consistent information, and is expressed in objective, formal language. The problem is solvable as stated.\n\nThe task is to first derive the relationship between the Number Needed to Treat ($NNT$) and the Absolute Risk Reduction ($ARR$), and then to compute the $NNT$ for the given study. We begin from the provided first principles.\n\nLet $R_C$ be the risk of recurrence in the control arm (eyelid hygiene alone), and let $R_T$ be the risk of recurrence in the treatment arm (eyelid hygiene plus warm compresses). As risk is defined as a probability, these values lie on the unit interval, $R_C \\in [0, 1]$ and $R_T \\in [0, 1]$.\n\nThe problem defines the Absolute Risk Reduction ($ARR$) as the difference in recurrence probabilities between the control and treatment arms. This can be written as:\n$$ARR = R_C - R_T$$\n\nNext, we address the Number Needed to Treat ($NNT$). The problem defines the $NNT$ as the number of patients who must receive the intervention such that, in expectation, one recurrence is prevented. Let's formalize this using the concept of expected value.\n\nConsider a group of $N$ patients who receive the intervention (the treatment arm). For each patient in this group, the probability of recurrence is $R_T$. The number of recurrences in this group is a random variable, but its expected value, $E[\\text{Events}_T]$, is the sum of the individual probabilities, which equals $N \\times R_T$.\n$$E[\\text{Events}_T] = N \\times R_T$$\n\nNow, consider the counterfactual scenario where the same group of $N$ patients did not receive the intervention and were instead in the control arm. In this case, the probability of recurrence for each patient would be $R_C$. The expected number of recurrences, $E[\\text{Events}_C]$, would be:\n$$E[\\text{Events}_C] = N \\times R_C$$\n\nThe expected number of recurrences prevented by the intervention for this group of $N$ patients is the difference between the expected number of events in the control scenario and the expected number of events in the treatment scenario.\n$$E[\\text{Events Prevented}] = E[\\text{Events}_C] - E[\\text{Events}_T]$$\n$$E[\\text{Events Prevented}] = (N \\times R_C) - (N \\times R_T)$$\n\nBy factoring out $N$, we obtain:\n$$E[\\text{Events Prevented}] = N(R_C - R_T)$$\n\nRecognizing that the term $(R_C - R_T)$ is the definition of $ARR$, we can substitute it into the equation:\n$$E[\\text{Events Prevented}] = N \\times ARR$$\n\nThe $NNT$ is the specific value of $N$ for which the expected number of prevented events is exactly one. Therefore, we set $E[\\text{Events Prevented}] = 1$ and solve for $N = NNT$:\n$$1 = NNT \\times ARR$$\n\nThis leads to the fundamental relationship between $NNT$ and $ARR$:\n$$NNT = \\frac{1}{ARR}$$\nThis completes the derivation portion of the problem.\n\nNow, we must compute the value of the $NNT$ using the data provided in the problem statement. The study measured an $ARR$ of $0.12$.\n$$ARR = 0.12$$\n\nSubstituting this value into our derived formula:\n$$NNT = \\frac{1}{0.12}$$\n\nThe problem requires the answer to be expressed as an exact fraction. We convert the decimal value $0.12$ into its fractional representation:\n$$0.12 = \\frac{12}{100}$$\n\nNow, we can calculate the $NNT$:\n$$NNT = \\frac{1}{\\frac{12}{100}} = \\frac{100}{12}$$\n\nTo simplify this fraction, we divide the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is $4$:\n$$NNT = \\frac{100 \\div 4}{12 \\div 4} = \\frac{25}{3}$$\n\nThus, the Number Needed to Treat is $\\frac{25}{3}$. This means that, based on the trial results, one would need to treat $\\frac{25}{3}$ (approximately $8.33$) patients with warm compresses in addition to standard eyelid hygiene for $6$ months to prevent one additional recurrence of a hordeolum or chalazion, compared to standard hygiene alone.",

The treatments described (intralesional steroid injection, incision and curettage) are standard second-line therapies for chalazia. The defined outcomes (resolution, recurrence) and the given probability values are clinically plausible.\n2.  **Well-Posed:** The problem is clearly defined.

It avoids any subjective or opinion-based statements.\n4.  **Completeness and Consistency:** The problem provides all necessary probabilities and explicitly states the conditional nature of recurrence. The assumption that prior treatment failure does not affect outcomes simplifies the model and makes the problem self-contained. There are no contradictions.\n5.  **Formalizability:** The problem is easily translatable into the formal language of probability theory.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is deemed valid as it is scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and self-contained. A full solution will be derived.\n\n### Solution Derivation\nThe objective is to calculate the probability of recurrence for each of the two treatment modalities. The problem specifies that recurrence is contingent upon prior resolution. Therefore, the event of interest is the joint occurrence of resolution *and* subsequent recurrence.\n\nLet us define the following events:\n-   $S$: The patient receives an intralesional steroid injection.\n-   $I$: The patient receives an incision and curettage.\n-   $R$: Resolution of the chalazion occurs.\n-   $C$: Recurrence of the chalazion occurs within six months.\n\nThe probabilities provided in the problem statement can be formally written as:\n1.  For the steroid injection modality:\n    -   The probability of resolution given steroid injection is $P(R|S) = 0.75$.\n    -   The probability of recurrence given both resolution and steroid injection is $P(C|R \\cap S) = 0.20$.\n2.  For the incision and curettage modality:\n    -   The probability of resolution given incision and curettage is $P(R|I) = 0.92$.\n    -   The probability of recurrence given both resolution and incision and curettage is $P(C|R \\cap I) = 0.08$.\n\nThe problem asks for the \"probability that a chalazion will recur\" for each modality. Since recurrence is defined only if resolution occurs, we are looking for the probability of the sequence of events: treatment $\\rightarrow$ resolution $\\rightarrow$ recurrence. This corresponds to the joint probability of resolution and recurrence, conditional on the chosen treatment.\n\n**Case 1: Intralesional Steroid Injection**\n\nWe need to calculate the probability of both resolution and recurrence occurring, given that the steroid injection was administered. This is the probability $P(R \\cap C | S)$.\n\nUsing the definition of conditional probability, also known as the chain rule for probability:\n$$P(A \\cap B | K) = P(A | B \\cap K) \\times P(B | K)$$\nLet's set $A=C$, $B=R$, and $K=S$. The formula becomes:\n$$P(C \\cap R | S) = P(C | R \\cap S) \\times P(R | S)$$\nThe two terms on the right-hand side are precisely the probabilities given in the problem statement. Substituting the given values:\n$$P(C \\cap R | S) = 0.20 \\times 0.75$$\n$$P(C \\cap R | S) = 0.15$$\nThis is the probability that a patient treated with a steroid injection will experience resolution followed by a recurrence.\n\n**Case 2: Incision and Curettage**\n\nSimilarly, for the incision and curettage modality, we need to calculate the probability of both resolution and recurrence, given that this treatment was administered. This is the probability $P(R \\cap C | I)$.\n\nApplying the same chain rule:\n$$P(C \\cap R | I) = P(C | R \\cap I) \\times P(R | I)$$\nSubstituting the given values for this modality:\n$$P(C \\cap R | I) = 0.08 \\times 0.92$$\n$$P(C \\cap R | I) = 0.0736$$\nThis is the probability that a patient treated with incision and curettage will experience resolution followed by a recurrence.\n\n**Final Calculation and Formatting**\nThe problem requires the answers to be expressed as decimals rounded to four significant figures.\n-   For the steroid injection, the probability is $0.15$. To four significant figures, this is $0.1500$.\n-   For the incision and curettage, the probability is $0.0736$. To four significant figures, this is $0.07360$.\n\nThe results are to be presented as a row matrix, with the steroid injection result first.",

            "problem": "A patient presents with a painful focal eyelid nodule and no fever. Given the clinical features, the conditional probability of an acute hordeolum versus a chalazion is estimated as follows: probability of hordeolum $= P(H) = 0.75$ and probability of chalazion $= P(C) = 0.25$. Consider the following three management strategies:\n\nStrategy $S_{A}$: Warm compresses and lid hygiene with escalation to a procedure on day $7$ if not resolved. For hordeolum, resolution without procedure occurs with probability $0.82$ by day $5$; otherwise, incision and drainage (ID) is performed on day $7$ with immediate resolution on day $7$, and complication probability $0.02$ for the procedure. For chalazion, resolution without procedure occurs with probability $0.30$ by day $7$; otherwise, intralesional steroid injection is performed on day $7$ (success probability $0.85$ with resolution on day $7$; failure probability $0.15$ followed by incision and curettage (IC) on day $14$ with resolution on day $14$). The injection has complication probability $0.03$ and the IC has complication probability $0.04$.\n\nStrategy $S_{B}$: Warm compresses plus topical antibiotic ointment for $7$ days with the same escalation rules as $S_{A}$. For hordeolum, resolution without procedure occurs with probability $0.90$ by day $4$; otherwise, ID is performed on day $7$ with complication probability $0.02$. For chalazion, topical antibiotic does not change outcomes relative to $S_{A}$ (i.e., resolution without procedure with probability $0.30$ by day $7$, else intralesional steroid injection on day $7$ with the same success and failure branches and complications as above).\n\nStrategy $S_{C}$: Immediate procedure based on the most likely diagnosis at presentation. For hordeolum, immediate ID is performed on day $0$, with resolution by day $1$ and complication probability $0.03$. For chalazion, immediate intralesional steroid injection is performed on day $0$, with success probability $0.85$ (resolution by day $1$); if the injection fails with probability $0.15$, IC is performed on day $7$ with resolution on day $7$.

The clinical scenario, including the conditions (hordeolum, chalazion) and management options (conservative vs. procedural), is standard in ophthalmology. The use of a utility function to model patient preferences by weighting time, intervention burden, and risk is a valid and common approach in medical decision-making. The probabilities and timelines are clinically plausible.\n2.  **Well-Posed**: The problem is well-posed. It provides all necessary quantitative data (probabilities, times, complication rates, utility weights) to compute a unique expected utility for each of the three strategies. A single maximal value can therefore be determined.\n3.  **Objective**: The problem is stated in objective, quantitative terms, free of subjective claims or bias.\n4.  **Completeness and Consistency**: The problem is self-contained. All required data are provided. There are no apparent contradictions in the given information. The sum of probabilities for mutually exclusive events is $1$ (e.g., $P(H) + P(C) = 0.75 + 0.25 = 1.0$).\n5.  **Ambiguity**: There is a minor ambiguity in the description of Strategy $S_C$: \"Immediate procedure based on the most likely diagnosis at presentation.\" This could imply that one procedure (ID, for the more likely hordeolum) is chosen for all patients. However, this interpretation would leave the outcome for a chalazion patient receiving an ID undefined. The subsequent sentences, \"For hordeolum, immediate ID is performed... For chalazion, immediate intralesional steroid injection is performed...\", clarify the intended meaning: the strategy is \"immediate intervention,\" where the specific intervention is contingent on the true (but initially unknown) diagnosis. This is the standard way to structure such a decision tree, and this interpretation renders the problem solvable and internally consistent.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\n\nThe problem is deemed **valid**. It is a well-structured application of decision analysis to a clinical scenario. The minor ambiguity in the description of $S_C$ is resolved by a logical interpretation consistent with the problem's structure. I will now proceed with the solution.\n\n### Solution\n\nThe objective is to calculate the expected utility for each of the three strategies, $S_{A}$, $S_{B}$, and $S_{C}$, and identify the maximum value. The utility function is given by:\n$$U = -\\alpha \\, \\mathbb{E}[T] - \\beta \\, \\mathbb{E}[P] - \\gamma \\, \\mathbb{E}[K]$$\nwhere $T$ is the time to resolution in days, $P$ is the number of procedures, and $K$ is the number of complications.
