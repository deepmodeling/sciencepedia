            "problem": "In an oculoplastic clinic, a validated clinical decision rule is applied to triage eyelid lesions for immediate excision versus routine follow-up. The rule returns a binary decision: “benign” or “suspicious for malignancy.” Consider the class of benign eyelid tumors, including lesions such as intradermal nevus, papilloma, seborrheic keratosis, and chalazion. Define “condition present” to mean that the lesion is benign and define a “positive test” to mean the decision rule outputs “benign.” The clinical decision rule is characterized by sensitivity and specificity with respect to the benign class. The sensitivity is the probability that the test is positive given the lesion is benign. The specificity is the probability that the test is negative given the lesion is malignant. Let the pretest probability that an eyelid lesion in this clinic is benign be $0.85$. For this clinical decision rule, the sensitivity is $0.92$ and the specificity is $0.80$. Using first principles of conditional probability and Bayes’ theorem, derive the expression for the post-test probability that a lesion is benign given that the decision rule outputs “benign,” and then compute its value for the given parameters. Express your final answer as a decimal rounded to four significant figures.",
            "solution": "The problem is first subjected to validation.\n\n### Step 1: Extract Givens\n-   Let $B$ be the event that an eyelid lesion is benign.\n-   Let $M$ be the event that an eyelid lesion is malignant.\n-   Let $T^+$ be the event that the clinical decision rule outputs “benign” (a positive test for the benign condition).\n-   Let $T^-$ be the event that the clinical decision rule outputs “suspicious for malignancy” (a negative test for the benign condition).\n-   The pretest probability that a lesion is benign is $P(B) = 0.85$.\n-   The sensitivity of the rule is the probability of a positive test given the lesion is benign: $P(T^+ | B) = 0.92$.\n-   The specificity of the rule is the probability of a negative test given the lesion is malignant: $P(T^- | M) = 0.80$.\n-   The task is to derive the expression for the post-test probability that a lesion is benign given the rule outputs “benign,” which is $P(B | T^+)$, and then compute its value.\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\n-   **Scientifically Grounded**: The problem is a standard application of Bayesian probability to the evaluation of a medical diagnostic test. The concepts of sensitivity, specificity, pretest probability (prevalence), and post-test probability (positive predictive value) are fundamental principles in biostatistics and evidence-based medicine. The problem is scientifically sound.\n-   **Well-Posed**: The problem is well-posed. It provides all the necessary quantities—pretest probability, sensitivity, and specificity—to uniquely determine the desired posterior probability using Bayes' theorem.\n-   **Objective**: The problem is stated in precise, quantitative terms. All quantities are clearly defined, and there is no ambiguity or subjective language.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. A solution will be provided.\n\nThe objective is to compute the post-test probability $P(B | T^+)$, which is the probability that a lesion is truly benign given that the decision rule has classified it as “benign.” This quantity is also known as the positive predictive value (PPV) of the test for the benign condition.\n\nWe will use Bayes' theorem, which states:\n$$ P(B | T^+) = \\frac{P(T^+ | B) P(B)}{P(T^+)} $$\nThe term in the denominator, $P(T^+)$, is the total probability of a positive test result. This can be calculated using the law of total probability, by considering the two mutually exclusive scenarios in which a positive test can occur: the lesion is truly benign ($B$), or the lesion is malignant ($M$).\n$$ P(T^+) = P(T^+ | B) P(B) + P(T^+ | M) P(M) $$\nSubstituting this into Bayes' theorem gives the full expression for $P(B | T^+)$:\n$$ P(B | T^+) = \\frac{P(T^+ | B) P(B)}{P(T^+ | B) P(B) + P(T^+ | M) P(M)} $$\nWe are given the following values:\n-   The pretest probability of a benign lesion, $P(B) = 0.85$.\n-   The sensitivity, $P(T^+ | B) = 0.92$.\n-   The specificity, $P(T^- | M) = 0.80$.\n\nFrom these givens, we can derive the remaining required probabilities.\nThe events $B$ (benign) and $M$ (malignant) are complementary. Therefore, the pretest probability of a malignant lesion is:\n$$ P(M) = 1 - P(B) = 1 - 0.85 = 0.15 $$\nThe specificity gives the probability of a negative test for a malignant lesion. The probability of a positive test for a malignant lesion, $P(T^+ | M)$, is the complement of the specificity, as for any given condition, the test must be either positive or negative. This is a false positive rate with respect to the benign class.\n$$ P(T^+ | M) = 1 - P(T^- | M) = 1 - 0.80 = 0.20 $$\nNow we have all the necessary components to compute $P(B | T^+)$. We substitute the numerical values into the derived expression:\n$$ P(B | T^+) = \\frac{(0.92) \\times (0.85)}{(0.92) \\times (0.85) + (0.20) \\times (0.15)} $$\nFirst, we calculate the numerator, which represents the probability of a true positive result (the lesion is benign AND the test is positive):\n$$ P(T^+ \\cap B) = P(T^+ | B) P(B) = 0.92 \\times 0.85 = 0.782 $$\nNext, we calculate the probability of a false positive result (the lesion is malignant AND the test is positive):\n$$ P(T^+ \\cap M) = P(T^+ | M) P(M) = 0.20 \\times 0.15 = 0.030 $$\nThe total probability of a positive test, $P(T^+)$, is the sum of these two probabilities:\n$$ P(T^+) = 0.782 + 0.030 = 0.812 $$\nFinally, we compute the post-test probability $P(B | T^+)$:\n$$ P(B | T^+) = \\frac{0.782}{0.812} \\approx 0.963054187... $$\nThe problem requires the answer to be expressed as a decimal rounded to four significant figures.\n$$ P(B | T^+) \\approx 0.9631 $$\nThis is the post-test probability that a lesion is benign given that the decision rule outputs “benign.”",

            "problem": "A 62-year-old adult with normal eyelid laxity presents with a benign lower eyelid margin tumor requiring a full-thickness pentagon excision. You are planning a primary closure by direct approximation of the eyelid edges. Let the horizontal eyelid margin length be $L = 28$ $\\mathrm{mm}$, measured from the medial canthus to the lateral canthus. For planning purposes, use the following foundational surgical facts and definitions:\n\n- Define the defect width $w$ as the horizontal base length of the pentagon excision at the eyelid margin.\n- Primary closure by direct approximation is governed by the ratio $f = w/L$, which must not exceed an upper threshold determined by the capacity of tissue recruitment without deforming the eyelid (notably avoiding lower eyelid retraction or rounding of the lateral canthus).\n- The widely used “rule of thirds” in lower eyelid reconstruction classifies horizontal defects by fractions of $L$: defects less than one-third of $L$ are directly closable without adjuncts; defects between one-third and two-thirds of $L$ require additional recruitment to avoid undue tension and distortion; defects exceeding two-thirds of $L$ require more complex reconstruction.\n- Lateral canthotomy with inferior cantholysis recruits lateral eyelid tissue without flap transfer and, in a normal adult lower eyelid, allows safe extension of direct primary closure into the second tertile of the rule-of-thirds classification.

            "solution": "The problem is validated as scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and internally consistent. It presents a scenario from oculoplastic surgery that can be modeled with a simple algebraic relationship. All necessary data and definitions are provided.\n\nThe problem requires the derivation of the maximum permissible pentagon excision width, denoted as $w_{\\max}$, for a lower eyelid undergoing primary closure with the assistance of a lateral canthotomy and inferior cantholysis.\n\nFrom first principles, we begin with the definitions provided in the problem statement. The relationship between the defect width $w$, the total horizontal eyelid margin length $L$, and the closure fraction $f$ is given by the equation:\n$$f = \\frac{w}{L}$$\nThis equation states that the closure fraction is the ratio of the defect width to the total eyelid length.\n\nWe are tasked with finding the maximum width, $w_{\\max}$, that can be closed under specific conditions. This maximum width will correspond to the maximum permissible closure fraction, $f_{\\max}$. Therefore, we can write the relationship for the maximum case as:\n$$f_{\\max} = \\frac{w_{\\max}}{L}$$\nTo find $w_{\\max}$, we can rearrange this equation by multiplying both sides by $L$:\n$$w_{\\max} = f_{\\max} \\cdot L$$\nThe problem provides the necessary values to solve this equation. The horizontal eyelid margin length is given as:\n$$L = 28 \\ \\mathrm{mm}$$\nThe problem states that for a normal adult lower eyelid, the use of lateral canthotomy with inferior cantholysis increases the maximum permissible closure fraction to the midpoint of the second tertile of the \"rule of thirds\". The second tertile is the interval from $\\frac{1}{3}$ to $\\frac{2}{3}$ of the eyelid length. The midpoint of this interval is $(\\frac{1}{3} + \\frac{2}{3}) \\div 2 = 1 \\div 2 = \\frac{1}{2}$. The problem explicitly provides this value, stating that the maximum safe fraction for primary closure with this assistance is:\n$$f_{\\max} = \\frac{1}{2}$$\nWe can now substitute the given values for $f_{\\max}$ and $L$ into our derived equation for $w_{\\max}$:\n$$w_{\\max} = \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot 28 \\ \\mathrm{mm}$$\nPerforming the multiplication yields the final result:\n$$w_{\\max} = 14 \\ \\mathrm{mm}$$\nThus, based on the provided surgical guidelines and definitions, the maximum full-thickness pentagon excision width that is permissible for primary closure with lateral canthotomy assistance is $14 \\ \\mathrm{mm}$.",
