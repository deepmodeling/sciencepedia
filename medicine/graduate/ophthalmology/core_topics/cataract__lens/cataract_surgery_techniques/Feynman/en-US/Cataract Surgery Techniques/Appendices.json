The provided values for refractive index, axial length, and measurement errors are realistic. The problem is well-posed, providing a clear objective and all necessary information to perform a first-order error propagation analysis. The language is objective and unambiguous. The problem is self-contained and free of contradictions. The model is an acknowledged approximation (`first-order equivalent-power approximation`), which is appropriate for a sensitivity analysis. The problem does not violate any of the invalidity criteria.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. I will now proceed with deriving the solution.\n\n### Derivation\nThe problem requires a first-order (linearized) error analysis to determine the error in the predicted IOL power, $\\Delta P$, and the resulting postoperative refraction error, $\\Delta R$, based on measurement errors in axial length ($\\Delta \\mathrm{AL}$) and keratometry ($\\Delta K$). All calculations involving length must use meters to be consistent with the definition of diopters ($D = m^{-1}$).\n\nFirst, we convert the given values to SI units:\n- True axial length: $\\mathrm{AL} = 24.00 \\text{ mm} = 0.024 \\text{ m}$.\n- Axial length measurement error: $\\Delta \\mathrm{AL} = +0.10 \\text{ mm} = +0.0001 \\text{ m}$.\n\nThe measured values are related to the true values and the errors by:\n$\\mathrm{AL}_{\\text{meas}} = \\mathrm{AL} + \\Delta \\mathrm{AL}$\n$K_{\\text{meas}} = K + \\Delta K$\n\n**1. Predicted IOL Power Error ($\\Delta P$)**\n\nThe predicted IOL power, $P_{\\text{pred}}$, is calculated using the measured values:\n$$P_{\\text{pred}} = \\frac{n}{\\mathrm{AL}_{\\text{meas}}} - K_{\\text{meas}}$$\nThe true IOL power required for emmetropia, $P_{\\text{true}}$, would be calculated using the true values:\n$$P_{\\text{true}} = \\frac{n}{\\mathrm{AL}} - K$$\nThe error in the predicted IOL power, $\\Delta P$, is the difference between the power of the IOL that is actually chosen ($P_{\\text{pred}}$) and the power that should have been chosen ($P_{\\text{true}}$):\n$$\\Delta P = P_{\\text{pred}} - P_{\\text{true}} = \\left(\\frac{n}{\\mathrm{AL}_{\\text{meas}}} - K_{\\text{meas}}\\right) - \\left(\\frac{n}{\\mathrm{AL}} - K\\right)$$\n$$\\Delta P = n \\left(\\frac{1}{\\mathrm{AL}_{\\text{meas}}} - \\frac{1}{\\mathrm{AL}}\\right) - (K_{\\text{meas}} - K)$$\nSubstituting $\\mathrm{AL}_{\\text{meas}} = \\mathrm{AL} + \\Delta \\mathrm{AL}$ and $K_{\\text{meas}} - K = \\Delta K$:\n$$\\Delta P = n \\left(\\frac{1}{\\mathrm{AL} + \\Delta \\mathrm{AL}} - \\frac{1}{\\mathrm{AL}}\\right) - \\Delta K$$\nFor a first-order approximation, we assume the measurement error $\\Delta \\mathrm{AL}$ is small compared to $\\mathrm{AL}$ ($\\Delta \\mathrm{AL} \\ll \\mathrm{AL}$). We can use a first-order Taylor expansion for the term $\\frac{1}{\\mathrm{AL} + \\Delta \\mathrm{AL}}$ around $\\Delta \\mathrm{AL}=0$:\n$$\\frac{1}{\\mathrm{AL} + \\Delta \\mathrm{AL}} \\approx \\frac{1}{\\mathrm{AL}} - \\frac{1}{\\mathrm{AL}^2}\\Delta \\mathrm{AL}$$\nSubstituting this into the expression for $\\Delta P$:\n$$\\Delta P \\approx n \\left(\\left(\\frac{1}{\\mathrm{AL}} - \\frac{\\Delta \\mathrm{AL}}{\\mathrm{AL}^2}\\right) - \\frac{1}{\\mathrm{AL}}\\right) - \\Delta K$$\n$$\\Delta P \\approx n \\left(-\\frac{\\Delta \\mathrm{AL}}{\\mathrm{AL}^2}\\right) - \\Delta K$$\nThis is the first-order error propagation mapping for the IOL power error.\n\n**2. Postoperative Refraction Error ($\\Delta R$)**\n\nThe postoperative refraction error $\\Delta R$ is the residual refractive error at the corneal plane when the eye has its true axial length $\\mathrm{AL}$ and true corneal power $K$, but contains the incorrectly predicted IOL, $P_{\\text{pred}}$.\nThe total power of the eye's optical system is $F_{\\text{actual}} = K + P_{\\text{pred}}$.\nThe vergence equation for an object at a finite distance (providing vergence $\\Delta R$) producing an image on the retina (at distance $\\mathrm{AL}$) is:\n$$L' = L + F_{\\text{actual}}$$\nHere, $L = \\Delta R$ is the required spectacle correction (object vergence at the corneal plane), and $L' = \\frac{n}{\\mathrm{AL}}$ is the image vergence required to focus on the retina.\n$$\\frac{n}{\\mathrm{AL}} = \\Delta R + (K + P_{\\text{pred}})$$\nSolving for $\\Delta R$:\n$$\\Delta R = \\frac{n}{\\mathrm{AL}} - K - P_{\\text{pred}}$$\nNow, we substitute the expression for $P_{\\text{pred}}$:\n$$\\Delta R = \\frac{n}{\\mathrm{AL}} - K - \\left(\\frac{n}{\\mathrm{AL}_{\\text{meas}}} - K_{\\text{meas}}\\right)$$\n$$\\Delta R = \\frac{n}{\\mathrm{AL}} - K - \\frac{n}{\\mathrm{AL}_{\\text{meas}}} + K_{\\text{meas}}$$\n$$\\Delta R = n \\left(\\frac{1}{\\mathrm{AL}} - \\frac{1}{\\mathrm{AL}_{\\text{meas}}}\\right) + (K_{\\text{meas}} - K)$$\nThis expression can be related to the IOL power error $\\Delta P$. Notice that $\\Delta R = - \\Delta P$. We can verify this with the first-order approximation. Using $\\mathrm{AL}_{\\text{meas}} = \\mathrm{AL} + \\Delta \\mathrm{AL}$ and $K_{\\text{meas}} - K = \\Delta K$:\n$$\\Delta R = n \\left(\\frac{1}{\\mathrm{AL}} - \\frac{1}{\\mathrm{AL} + \\Delta \\mathrm{AL}}\\right) + \\Delta K$$\nUsing the same Taylor expansion as before:\n$$\\Delta R \\approx n \\left(\\frac{1}{\\mathrm{AL}} - \\left(\\frac{1}{\\mathrm{AL}} - \\frac{\\Delta \\mathrm{AL}}{\\mathrm{AL}^2}\\right)\\right) + \\Delta K$$\n$$\\Delta R \\approx n \\left(\\frac{\\Delta \\mathrm{AL}}{\\mathrm{AL}^2}\\right) + \\Delta K$$\nThis is the first-order error propagation mapping for the postoperative refraction error, and it is indeed equal to $-\\Delta P$.\n\n**Numerical Evaluation**\n\nWe now substitute the given numerical values into the derived first-order expressions.\nGiven:\n$n = 1.336$\n$\\mathrm{AL} = 0.024 \\text{ m}$\n$\\Delta \\mathrm{AL} = +0.0001 \\text{ m}$\n$\\Delta K = +0.25 \\text{ D}$\n\nFirst, we calculate the component of the error due to $\\Delta \\mathrm{AL}$:\n$$\\frac{n \\cdot \\Delta \\mathrm{AL}}{\\mathrm{AL}^2} = \\frac{1.336 \\cdot (0.0001 \\text{ m})}{(0.024 \\text{ m})^2} = \\frac{0.0001336}{0.000576} \\text{ m}^{-1} \\approx 0.231944 \\text{ D}$$\n\nNow, we calculate $\\Delta P$ and $\\Delta R$:\nFor the IOL power error $\\Delta P$:\n$$\\Delta P \\approx -\\frac{n \\cdot \\Delta \\mathrm{AL}}{\\mathrm{AL}^2} - \\Delta K$$\n$$\\Delta P \\approx -0.231944 \\text{ D} - 0.25 \\text{ D} = -0.481944 \\text{ D}$$\nRounding to four significant figures, $\\Delta P \\approx -0.4819 \\text{ D}$.\n\nFor the postoperative refraction error $\\Delta R$:\n$$\\Delta R \\approx +\\frac{n \\cdot \\Delta \\mathrm{AL}}{\\mathrm{AL}^2} + \\Delta K$$\n$$\\Delta R \\approx +0.231944 \\text{ D} + 0.25 \\text{ D} = +0.481944 \\text{ D}$$\nRounding to four significant figures, $\\Delta R \\approx +0.4819 \\text{ D}$.\n\nThe results are consistent with the relationship $\\Delta R \\approx -\\Delta P$. An overestimation of axial length and corneal power leads to the selection of an IOL that is too weak ($\\Delta P$ is negative). This underpowered IOL results in a hyperopic refractive error ($\\Delta R$ is positive), meaning a positive (convex) spectacle lens is required to refocus light onto the retina.",

It represents a standard application of the Hagen-Poiseuille law to a biomedical engineering context.\n\n### Task 1: Derivation of the Volumetric Flow Rate ($Q$)\n\nWe begin by modeling the flow of the Ophthalmic Viscosurgical Device (OVD) through the aspiration tip as a steady, incompressible, laminar flow of a Newtonian fluid through a rigid cylindrical tube of radius $r$ and length $L$. We use a cylindrical coordinate system $(\\rho_{rad}, \\phi, z)$, where $z$ is the axial direction of flow and $\\rho_{rad}$ is the radial coordinate from the centerline.

Its vector representation is:\n$$\n\\mathbf{A}_{cornea} = \\begin{pmatrix} C \\cos(2 \\cdot 0^{\\circ}) \\\\ C \\sin(2 \\cdot 0^{\\circ}) \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} C \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\n\nThe IOL is designed to perfectly neutralize this corneal astigmatism when it is correctly aligned. Therefore, the astigmatic correction provided by the IOL in its intended position must be the negative of the corneal astigmatism vector:\n$$\n\\mathbf{A}_{IOL, intended} = -\\mathbf{A}_{cornea} = \\begin{pmatrix} -C \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\n\nHowever, the IOL rotates by a small angle $\\Delta = +10^{\\circ}$ counterclockwise. This physical rotation of the IOL by $\\Delta$ causes its astigmatic vector to rotate by an angle of $2\\Delta$ in the vector representation space. The actual astigmatic correction provided by the rotated IOL, $\\mathbf{A}_{IOL, actual}$, is found by applying a rotation matrix $R(2\\Delta)$ to the intended IOL vector:\n$$\n\\mathbf{A}_{IOL, actual} = R(2\\Delta) \\mathbf{A}_{IOL, intended} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos(2\\Delta) & -\\sin(2\\Delta) \\\\ \\sin(2\\Delta) & \\cos(2\\Delta) \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} -C \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} -C \\cos(2\\Delta) \\\\ -C \\sin(2\\Delta) \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\n\nThe residual astigmatism, $\\mathbf{A}_{res}$, is the vector sum of the corneal astigmatism and the actual correction from the rotated IOL:\n$$\n\\mathbf{A}_{res} = \\mathbf{A}_{cornea} + \\mathbf{A}_{IOL, actual}\n$$\n$$\n\\mathbf{A}_{res} = \\begin{pmatrix} C \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix} + \\begin{pmatrix} -C \\cos(2\\Delta) \\\\ -C \\sin(2\\Delta) \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} C(1 - \\cos(2\\Delta)) \\\\ -C \\sin(2\\Delta) \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\n\nThe problem requires resolving this residual vector into its \"on-axis\" and \"cross-axis\" components. The \"on-axis\" direction is defined as the axis of the intended IOL alignment, which we have set to the physical axis $\\alpha = 0^{\\circ}$. In the vector space, this corresponds to the direction of the first basis vector, $(1, 0)$, which represents the $J_0$ component. The \"cross-axis\" direction is the orthogonal direction, which corresponds to the second basis vector, $(0, 1)$, representing the $J_{45}$ component. Therefore, the on-axis and cross-axis components are simply the $x$ and $y$ components of the residual vector $\\mathbf{A}_{res}$.\n\nThe on-axis component is:\n$$\nA_{on} = C(1 - \\cos(2\\Delta))\n$$\nThis component represents the amount of undercorrection of the original astigmatism, as it is aligned with the original astigmatic axis.\n\nThe cross-axis component is:\n$$\nA_{cross} = -C \\sin(2\\Delta)\n$$\nThis component represents the new astigmatism induced at a $45^{\\circ}$ oblique axis due to the misalignment.\n\nNow we substitute the given numerical values: $C = 2.0\\,\\mathrm{D}$ and $\\Delta = 10^{\\circ}$. Thus, $2\\Delta = 20^{\\circ}$.\n\nOn-axis component calculation:\n$$\nA_{on} = 2.0 \\times (1 - \\cos(20^{\\circ})) \\approx 2.0 \\times (1 - 0.9396926) = 2.0 \\times 0.0603074 = 0.1206148\\,\\mathrm{D}\n$$\nRounding to three significant figures, $A_{on} \\approx 0.121\\,\\mathrm{D}$.\n\nCross-axis component calculation:\n$$\nA_{cross} = -2.0 \\times \\sin(20^{\\circ}) \\approx -2.0 \\times 0.3420201 = -0.6840402\\,\\mathrm{D}\n$$\nRounding to three significant figures, $A_{cross} \\approx -0.684\\,\\mathrm{D}$.\n\nThe two residual components are $0.121\\,\\mathrm{D}$ for the on-axis component and $-0.684\\,\\mathrm{D}$ for the cross-axis component.",
