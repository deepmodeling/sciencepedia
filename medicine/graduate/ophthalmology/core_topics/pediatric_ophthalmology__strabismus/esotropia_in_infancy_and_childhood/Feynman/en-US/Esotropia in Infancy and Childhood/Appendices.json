            "problem": "A pediatric ophthalmology service is evaluating a child with suspected accommodative esotropia. The clinical goal is to determine the Accommodative Convergence to Accommodation (AC/A) ratio using the gradient method, which isolates the effect of changes in accommodation on convergence by altering the accommodative stimulus at a fixed viewing distance. The child, corrected to emmetropia, fixates a standard near target at a constant distance of $33$ $\\mathrm{cm}$. When plano viewing (no additional lens), a stable near esodeviation is recorded. When $+2.00$ diopters ($+2.00$ $\\mathrm{D}$) lenses are introduced binocularly at the same viewing distance, the measured near angle of deviation reduces by $10$ prism diopters ($10$ $\\mathrm{PD}$). \n\nStarting from first principles appropriate to clinical visual optics and binocular vision:\n- Use the definition of accommodation stimulus at distance, $A(d)$, and the effect of adding a thin lens of power $L$ on the retinal image vergence and thus on the accommodative stimulus.\n- Use the definition of a prism diopter as a unit of ocular deviation and the assumption that, over small ranges, the accommodative-convergence response varies approximately linearly with accommodation in the gradient test configuration.\n- Define the gradient AC/A ratio as the proportionality between the change in measured vergence demand (in $\\mathrm{PD}$) and the change in accommodative stimulus (in $\\mathrm{D}$) induced by the lens, and derive the corresponding expression from these definitions without invoking any pre-memorized shortcut formula.\n\nCompute the numerical value of the gradient AC/A ratio for this child from the given data. Express your final result in prism diopters per diopter ($\\mathrm{PD}/\\mathrm{D}$). Give the exact value; no rounding is required.",
            "solution": "**1. Accommodative Stimulus**\n\nThe accommodative stimulus, $A$, is the dioptric power the eye's crystalline lens must exert to bring a near object into sharp focus on the retina. For an emmetropic eye viewing an object at a distance $d$ (in meters), the stimulus is the reciprocal of the distance:\n$$A_{\\text{target}} = \\frac{1}{d}$$\nThe given viewing distance is $d = 33 \\ \\mathrm{cm} = 0.33 \\ \\mathrm{m}$. Therefore, the accommodative stimulus required to focus on the target itself is:\n$$A_{\\text{target}} = \\frac{1}{0.33} \\ \\mathrm{D} = \\frac{100}{33} \\ \\mathrm{D}$$\nIn clinical practice, this is often approximated as $3 \\ \\mathrm{D}$, but we will proceed with the exact value as given.\n\n**2. Effect of Lenses on Accommodation**\n\nWhen a thin lens of power $L$ is placed before the eye, it alters the vergence of light reaching the cornea. A positive (plus) lens converges light, reducing the accommodative effort required by the eye. A negative (minus) lens diverges light, increasing the required effort. The new effective accommodative stimulus, $A'$, is given by:\n$$A' = A_{\\text{target}} - L$$\n\n**3. Change in Accommodative Stimulus ($\\Delta A$)**\n\nThe gradient method measures the effect of a change in accommodation. We compare two conditions:\n- **Condition 1:** Viewing with plano lenses. The additional lens power is $L_1 = 0 \\ \\mathrm{D}$. The accommodative stimulus is $A_1 = A_{\\text{target}} - L_1 = \\frac{1}{0.33} \\ \\mathrm{D}$.\n- **Condition 2:** Viewing with $+2.00 \\ \\mathrm{D}$ lenses. The additional lens power is $L_2 = +2.00 \\ \\mathrm{D}$. The accommodative stimulus is $A_2 = A_{\\text{target}} - L_2 = \\left(\\frac{1}{0.33} - 2.00\\right) \\ \\mathrm{D}$.\n\nThe change in accommodative stimulus, $\\Delta A$, is the difference between the stimulus in the two conditions. For the definition of the AC/A ratio, we are interested in the magnitude of this change, which isolates the effect of the lens itself.\n$$\\Delta A = |A_2 - A_1| = \\left| \\left(\\frac{1}{0.33} - 2.00\\right) - \\frac{1}{0.33} \\right| \\ \\mathrm{D} = |-2.00| \\ \\mathrm{D} = 2.00 \\ \\mathrm{D}$$\nThus, introducing the $+2.00 \\ \\mathrm{D}$ lenses creates a $2.00 \\ \\mathrm{D}$ change (a relaxation) in the accommodative stimulus.\n\n**4. Change in Accommodative Convergence ($\\Delta C$)**\n\nAccommodative convergence is the convergence of the visual axes that is reflexively linked to the act of accommodation. The problem assumes a linear relationship between accommodation and accommodative convergence over the tested range. Therefore, a change in accommodation, $\\Delta A$, will induce a proportional change in convergence, $\\Delta C$.\n\nThe ocular deviation is measured in prism diopters ($\\mathrm{PD}$). One prism diopter corresponds to a deviation of $1 \\ \\mathrm{cm}$ at a distance of $1 \\ \\mathrm{m}$. In the gradient method, the viewing distance is fixed, so any change in the measured ocular deviation is attributed solely to the change in accommodative convergence.\n\nThe problem states that the initial esodeviation (an inward turn of the eyes) *reduces* by $10 \\ \\mathrm{PD}$ when the $+2.00 \\ \\mathrm{D}$ lenses are introduced. This reduction in an inward deviation corresponds to a reduction in convergence. The magnitude of this change in convergence is:\n$$\\Delta C = 10 \\ \\mathrm{PD}$$\n\n**5. Derivation and Calculation of the Gradient AC/A Ratio**\n\nThe gradient AC/A ratio, which we will denote as $R_{AC/A}$, is defined as the proportionality between the change in accommodative convergence (in $\\mathrm{PD}$) and the change in accommodative stimulus (in $\\mathrm{D}$).\n$$R_{AC/A} = \\frac{\\text{Change in Convergence}}{\\text{Change in Accommodation}} = \\frac{\\Delta C}{\\Delta A}$$\nSubstituting the derived values for $\\Delta C$ and $\\Delta A$:\n$$\\Delta C = 10 \\ \\mathrm{PD}$$\n$$\\Delta A = 2.00 \\ \\mathrm{D}$$\nThe AC/A ratio is therefore:\n$$R_{AC/A} = \\frac{10 \\ \\mathrm{PD}}{2.00 \\ \\mathrm{D}}$$\n$$R_{AC/A} = 5 \\ \\frac{\\mathrm{PD}}{\\mathrm{D}}$$\nThe numerical value of the gradient AC/A ratio for this child is $5$.",

            "problem": "A $2$-year-old child with early-onset esotropia demonstrates orthophoria at distance and a near esodeviation of $20$ Prism Diopters (PD) when fixating a target at $33$ centimeters. Cycloplegic refraction is fully corrected for distance, and there is no evidence of latent mechanical restriction. The clinician determines that the near deviation is driven by accommodative convergence consistent with a high accommodative convergence to accommodation ratio (AC/A), measured at $8$ PD per Diopter (D). A bifocal add is planned to reduce the accommodative demand at near and thereby reduce accommodative convergence. Assume the bifocal add fully reduces the stimulus to accommodation by its dioptric power at the child’s typical working distance, with no accommodative lag under the add.\n\nStarting from first principles, use the definition that the accommodative demand at viewing distance $d$ (in meters) is $A = \\frac{1}{d}$ Diopters and that the induced convergence from accommodation is proportional to the accommodation stimulus via the AC/A ratio.

Express your final answer as the lens power in diopters (D), rounded to three significant figures.",
            "solution": "The core of the problem is to determine the power of a bifocal lens, $P_{add}$, required to neutralize a near esodeviation caused by accommodative convergence. We will proceed by applying the fundamental principles of accommodation and convergence.\n\nLet the near esodeviation be $E_N$, the distance deviation be $E_D$, and the accommodative convergence be $C_A$. The total near deviation is the sum of the distance deviation and the convergence induced by accommodation:\n$$E_N = E_D + C_A$$\nThe problem states that the child is orthophoric at distance, which means the distance deviation $E_D = 0$ Prism Diopters (PD). Therefore, the entire near deviation is due to accommodative convergence.\n$$E_N = C_A$$\nWe are given that the near esodeviation is $E_N = 20$ PD. Thus, the accommodative convergence at the near viewing distance is $C_A = 20$ PD.\n\nThe objective is to reduce this near esodeviation from $20$ PD to $0$ PD. This requires a change in the deviation, $\\Delta E_N$, of $-20$ PD. Since the deviation is entirely due to accommodative convergence, this change must be produced by an equal change in accommodative convergence, $\\Delta C_A$.\n$$\\Delta C_A = -20 \\text{ PD}$$\nThe change in accommodative convergence, $\\Delta C_A$, is related to the change in the accommodative stimulus, $\\Delta A$, through the accommodative convergence to accommodation ratio, $R_{AC/A}$.\n$$\\Delta C_A = \\Delta A \\times R_{AC/A}$$\nWe are given $R_{AC/A} = 8$ PD per Diopter (D).\n\nA bifocal add is a positive-power lens that reduces the amount of accommodation the eyes must exert to focus on a near object. A bifocal add of power $P_{add}$ (in Diopters) reduces the accommodative stimulus by that amount. Therefore, the change in accommodation stimulus provided by the bifocal is:\n$$\\Delta A = -P_{add}$$\nSubstituting this into the equation for the change in convergence:\n$$\\Delta C_A = (-P_{add}) \\times R_{AC/A}$$\nWe can now solve for the required bifocal power, $P_{add}$. We have the desired change in convergence, $\\Delta C_A = -20$ PD, and the given AC/A ratio, $R_{AC/A} = 8$ PD/D.\n$$-20 \\text{ PD} = (-P_{add}) \\times (8 \\text{ PD/D})$$\nSolving for $P_{add}$:\n$$P_{add} = \\frac{20}{8} \\text{ D}$$\n$$P_{add} = 2.5 \\text{ D}$$\n\nThe problem requires verification that this add power does not exceed the near accommodative demand at the working distance of $33$ centimeters. The accommodative demand, $A_{demand}$, at a viewing distance $d$ (in meters) is given by the formula:\n$$A_{demand} = \\frac{1}{d}$$\nThe viewing distance is $d = 33 \\text{ cm} = 0.33$ m.\n$$A_{demand} = \\frac{1}{0.33 \\text{ m}} \\approx 3.0303... \\text{ D}$$\nThe calculated bifocal add power is $P_{add} = 2.5$ D. We must verify that $P_{add} \\le A_{demand}$.\n$$2.5 \\text{ D} \\le 3.0303... \\text{ D}$$\nThis inequality holds true. The bifocal add power is less than the total accommodative demand, which is a necessary condition for a valid optical correction. This ensures that the patient still needs to exert some positive accommodation ($A_{residual} = A_{demand} - P_{add} \\approx 3.03 - 2.5 = 0.53$ D) to see the near target clearly, preventing the demand for physiologically impossible negative accommodation.\n\nThe derived bifocal add power is $2.5$ D. The problem requests the answer rounded to three significant figures, which is $2.50$.",
