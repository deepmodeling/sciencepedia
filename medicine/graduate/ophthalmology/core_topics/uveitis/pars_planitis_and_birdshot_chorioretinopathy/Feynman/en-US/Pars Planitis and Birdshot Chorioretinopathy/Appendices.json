            "problem": "A $38$-year-old patient presents with intermediate uveitis symptoms including floaters and mild blurred vision. Examination demonstrates vitreous cells and prominent inferior peripheral fibrovascular exudates over the pars plana consistent with \"snowbanking,\" along with scattered \"snowballs\" in the vitreous. Fundus evaluation reveals no cream-colored ovoid choroidal lesions radiating from the optic disc or aligned along retinal vessels. Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) typing shows HLA-A29 positivity. Electroretinogram (ERG), fluorescein angiography (FA), and indocyanine green angiography (ICG) are performed. The ERG is within normal limits for scotopic and photopic responses, the FA shows mild peripheral perivascular leakage without characteristic late diffuse leakage or optic disc hyperfluorescence, and the ICG demonstrates no clusters of hypofluorescent dark spots.\n\nUsing fundamental definitions of disease classification in uveitis and well-established diagnostic criteria and imaging correlates, determine whether the diagnosis of birdshot chorioretinopathy (also called birdshot retinochoroidopathy) is supported or refuted in this scenario, and justify the conclusion by identifying pathognomonic features that must be present or absent. Choose the single best option.\n\nA. The diagnosis of birdshot chorioretinopathy is confirmed because HLA-A29 positivity is pathognomonic and snowbanking represents a recognized variant of birdshot; the absence of choroidal lesions does not preclude diagnosis.\n\nB. The diagnosis of pars planitis (idiopathic intermediate uveitis) is favored and birdshot chorioretinopathy is refuted because peripheral snowbanking and vitreous \"snowballs\" are hallmark features of intermediate uveitis, while the absence of characteristic birdshot choroidal lesions on fundus and ICG, together with a normal ERG, argues strongly against birdshot despite HLA-A29 positivity.\n\nC. The diagnosis remains indeterminate; biopsy of presumed choroidal lesions is required to establish birdshot chorioretinopathy since HLA-A29 is insufficient.\n\nD. Posterior scleritis is the most likely diagnosis because snowbanking and HLA-A29 positivity together suggest scleral inflammation; birdshot cannot be assessed without ocular ultrasound findings.",
            "solution": "The problem requires a differential diagnosis between two forms of uveitis, pars planitis and birdshot chorioretinopathy, based on a specific set of clinical and laboratory findings. The validity of the problem statement must first be assessed.\n\n**Step 1: Extract Givens**\n- Patient age: $38$ years.\n- Symptoms: Floaters, mild blurred vision.\n- Clinical Examination Findings:\n    - Vitreous cells are present.\n    - Inferior peripheral fibrovascular exudates over the pars plana, described as \"snowbanking,\" are present.\n    - Scattered \"snowballs\" in the vitreous are present.\n    - Fundus evaluation reveals an absence of cream-colored ovoid choroidal lesions.\n- Ancillary Test Results:\n    - Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) typing: HLA-A29 positive.\n    - Electroretinogram (ERG): Normal scotopic and photopic responses.\n    - Fluorescein Angiography (FA): Mild peripheral perivascular leakage. Absence of characteristic late diffuse leakage or optic disc hyperfluorescence.\n    - Indocyanine Green Angiography (ICG): Absence of clusters of hypofluorescent dark spots.\n\n**Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens**\nThe problem statement describes a realistic clinical scenario in ophthalmology, presenting a differential diagnosis challenge.\n- **Scientifically Grounded:** The problem uses standard, well-defined clinical terminology (e.g., pars planitis, birdshot chorioretinopathy, snowbanking, HLA-A29, ERG, FA, ICG) and describes plausible findings. The concepts are rooted in established medical science.\n- **Well-Posed:** The set of findings, including both positive and negative results, provides sufficient information to arrive at a reasoned diagnostic conclusion. The question is clearly formulated to test knowledge of diagnostic criteria.\n- **Objective:** The description of clinical signs and test results is factual and quantitative where appropriate (e.g., \"normal ERG\"), avoiding subjective or ambiguous language.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. It presents a clear, self-contained, and scientifically sound clinical case that can be resolved by applying established diagnostic principles. The solution process can proceed.\n\n**Principle-Based Derivation**\nThe core task is to differentiate between pars planitis (a form of idiopathic intermediate uveitis) and birdshot chorioretinopathy (BSCR), which is a posterior uveitis that can have features of intermediate uveitis. This is achieved by comparing the patient's presentation to the defining characteristics of each disease.\n\n1.  **Analysis for Pars Planitis (Idiopathic Intermediate Uveitis):** Intermediate uveitis is defined by inflammation primarily localized to the vitreous and peripheral retina. Pars planitis is the idiopathic subset of intermediate uveitis.\n    - The presence of vitreous inflammatory cells (\"vitritis\") is a cardinal sign. The patient has \"vitreous cells.\"\n    - \"Snowballs\" (aggregates of inflammatory cells in the vitreous) are highly characteristic. The patient has \"snowballs.\"\n    - \"Snowbanking\" (fibrovascular exudates over the pars plana and peripheral retina) is considered the pathognomonic sign of pars planitis. The patient has \"prominent inferior peripheral fibrovascular exudates...consistent with 'snowbanking'.\"\n    - The patient's symptoms of floaters and mild blurred vision are classic for this condition.\n    - The FA finding of \"mild peripheral perivascular leakage\" is also consistent with intermediate uveitis.\n    - **Conclusion:** The patient's clinical presentation overwhelmingly matches the classic description of pars planitis.\n\n2.  **Analysis for Birdshot Chorioretinopathy (BSCR):** BSCR is a distinct clinical entity with well-defined diagnostic criteria, most notably codified by the Standardization of Uveitis Nomenclature (SUN) working group.\n    - **Essential Criteria for Diagnosis:**\n        - **Characteristic Birdshot Lesions:** The presence of multiple, discrete, cream-colored or orangish ovoid spots distributed in the fundus, typically radiating from the optic disc, is a *sine qua non* for the diagnosis. The problem explicitly states there is an \"absence of cream-colored ovoid choroidal lesions.\"\n        - **Bilateral involvement:** Required for diagnosis. (Assumed, but the absence of lesions is the critical point).\n        - **Mild intraocular inflammation:** The patient's vitritis is consistent.\n    - **Supportive Criteria and Ancillary Tests:**\n        - **HLA-A29 Positivity:** The patient is HLA-A29 positive. This association is extremely strong (present in over $95\\%$ of BSCR patients), but HLA-A29 is also found in approximately $7-8\\%$ of the general Caucasian population. It is a necessary but not sufficient condition for diagnosis.\n        - **ERG Abnormalities:** A hallmark of progressive BSCR is significant dysfunction of both rod and cone systems, often detected by ERG even in early stages or before severe vision loss. The patient's ERG is \"within normal limits,\" which is strong evidence against BSCR.\n        - **Angiography:** In BSCR, FA often shows diffuse capillary leakage and late optic disc hyperfluorescence. ICG is particularly sensitive, showing multiple hypofluorescent spots (ICGA dark spots) that often outnumber the clinically visible fundus lesions. The patient's FA lacks these features, and the ICG shows \"no clusters of hypofluorescent dark spots.\"\n\n3.  **Synthesis:**\n    The patient demonstrates the pathognomonic signs of pars planitis (snowbanking, snowballs). Conversely, the patient lacks the essential, required clinical sign for BSCR (the eponymous \"birdshot\" choroidal lesions). Furthermore, key ancillary tests that are expected to be abnormal in BSCR (ERG, ICG, and specific FA findings) are normal or negative. The sole finding in favor of BSCR is HLA-A29 positivity, which, in isolation, is diagnostically insufficient and can be an incidental finding. Therefore, the diagnosis of BSCR is effectively refuted, and the diagnosis of pars planitis is strongly supported.\n\n**Option-by-Option Analysis**\n\n**A. The diagnosis of birdshot chorioretinopathy is confirmed because HLA-A29 positivity is pathognomonic and snowbanking represents a recognized variant of birdshot; the absence of choroidal lesions does not preclude diagnosis.**\n- **Evaluation:** This statement contains multiple inaccuracies. First, HLA-A29 is a strong genetic association, not a pathognomonic sign. Second, snowbanking is the pathognomonic sign of pars planitis, not a variant of BSCR. Third, the absence of the characteristic choroidal lesions is a fundamental feature that in a typical clinical setting *does* preclude the diagnosis of BSCR according to established international criteria.\n- **Verdict:** Incorrect.\n\n**B. The diagnosis of pars planitis (idiopathic intermediate uveitis) is favored and birdshot chorioretinopathy is refuted because peripheral snowbanking and vitreous \"snowballs\" are hallmark features of intermediate uveitis, while the absence of characteristic birdshot choroidal lesions on fundus and ICG, together with a normal ERG, argues strongly against birdshot despite HLA-A29 positivity.**\n- **Evaluation:** This statement correctly identifies snowbanking and snowballs as hallmarks of intermediate uveitis/pars planitis. It accurately identifies the absence of characteristic lesions (on funduscopy and ICG) and the normal ERG as powerful evidence against BSCR. It correctly places the HLA-A29 finding in its proper context as a supportive but non-diagnostic marker when key clinical signs are absent. This analysis aligns perfectly with the principles of uveitis diagnosis.\n- **Verdict:** Correct.\n\n**C. The diagnosis remains indeterminate; biopsy of presumed choroidal lesions is required to establish birdshot chorioretinopathy since HLA-A29 is insufficient.**\n- **Evaluation:** This is incorrect. The diagnosis is not indeterminate; the evidence strongly favors pars planitis. A key premise of the option is flawed, as the problem states there are no choroidal lesions to biopsy (\"absence of...choroidal lesions\"). Furthermore, chorioretinal biopsy is a high-risk, rarely performed procedure that is not part of the standard diagnostic workup for BSCR.\n- **Verdict:** Incorrect.\n\n**D. Posterior scleritis is the most likely diagnosis because snowbanking and HLA-A29 positivity together suggest scleral inflammation; birdshot cannot be assessed without ocular ultrasound findings.**\n- **Evaluation:** This is incorrect. The clinical picture (snowbanking, snowballs, minimal symptoms beyond floaters) is not typical for posterior scleritis, which often involves pain and may show scleral thickening, choroidal folds, or subretinal fluid. There is no recognized association between \"snowbanking and HLA-A29 positivity\" and posterior scleritis. Finally, the statement that BSCR cannot be assessed without ultrasound is false; diagnosis relies primarily on fundus examination, FA, ICG, and ERG. Ocular ultrasound is the primary tool for posterior scleritis, not BSCR.\n- **Verdict:** Incorrect.",

            "introduction": "Ancillary testing plays a key role in uveitis diagnostics, but interpreting the results requires more than just knowing a test's sensitivity and specificity. The clinical value of a test, such as Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA)-A29 typing for birdshot chorioretinopathy, is profoundly influenced by the pretest probability of the disease in the population being tested. This exercise  applies Bayes' theorem to calculate the positive predictive value, providing a quantitative framework for understanding why a \"positive\" result may not be conclusive in low-prevalence settings.",

Express your final result as a single decimal number (do not use a percentage sign), and round your answer to four significant figures.",
            "solution": "The problem is well-posed and scientifically grounded. All necessary data are provided, and the concepts of prevalence, sensitivity, specificity, and predictive value are standard in medical diagnostics and epidemiology. Therefore, a solution can be derived.\n\nLet $D$ be the event that a patient has birdshot chorioretinopathy (BCR), and let $D^c$ be the complementary event that the patient does not have BCR. Let $T^+$ be the event of a positive test result for HLA-A29, and $T^-$ be the event of a negative test result.\n\nThe problem provides the following information, which we formalize using probability notation:\n\n1.  **Prevalence**: The pretest probability of disease is given as $1\\%$. This is the marginal probability of a patient having BCR.\n    $$P(D) = 0.01$$\n    The probability of not having the disease is therefore:\n    $$P(D^c) = 1 - P(D) = 1 - 0.01 = 0.99$$\n\n2.  **Sensitivity**: The sensitivity of the test is the probability of a positive test result given that the patient has the disease.

This is given as $85\\%$.\n    $$\\text{Specificity} = P(T^-|D^c) = 0.85$$\n\nFrom the definition of specificity, we can determine the probability of a positive test in a disease-free patient, which is the false positive rate. This is the complement of the specificity.\n$$P(T^+|D^c) = 1 - P(T^-|D^c) = 1 - 0.85 = 0.15$$\n\nThe objective is to derive and compute the positive predictive value (PPV). The PPV is defined as the posterior probability of having the disease given a positive test result, which is the conditional probability $P(D|T^+)$.\n\nWe will use Bayes' theorem to find this posterior probability. Bayes' theorem states:\n$$P(D|T^+) = \\frac{P(T^+|D) P(D)}{P(T^+)}$$\n\nThe numerator contains terms that are already known: $P(T^+|D)$ is the sensitivity and $P(D)$ is the prevalence.\nThe denominator, $P(T^+)$, is the total probability of a positive test result. This can be calculated using the law of total probability, which marginalizes over the disease status:\n$$P(T^+) = P(T^+|D)P(D) + P(T^+|D^c)P(D^c)$$\n\nLet's substitute the known definitions and values into this expression.\nThe term $P(T^+|D)P(D)$ represents the probability of a true positive result in the population of patients undergoing the test.\nThe term $P(T^+|D^c)P(D^c)$ represents the probability of a false positive result in the same population.\n\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$P(T^+) = (0.95)(0.01) + (0.15)(0.99)$$\n$$P(T^+) = 0.0095 + 0.1485$$\n$$P(T^+) = 0.1580$$\n\nNow we have all the components to calculate the PPV using Bayes' theorem:\n$$P(D|T^+) = \\frac{P(T^+|D) P(D)}{P(T^+)} = \\frac{(0.95)(0.01)}{0.1580}$$\n$$P(D|T^+) = \\frac{0.0095}{0.1580}$$\n\nPerforming the final calculation:\n$$P(D|T^+) \\approx 0.06012658...$$\n\nThe problem requires the result to be rounded to four significant figures. The first significant figure is $6$. The subsequent three are $0$, $1$, and $2$. The digit following the fourth significant figure is $6$, which is greater than or equal to $5$, so we round up the last significant figure ($2$) to $3$.\nThus, the computed value rounded to four significant figures is $0.06013$.\n\nThis result indicates that for a patient in this specific clinical setting who tests positive for HLA-A29, the probability of actually having birdshot chorioretinopathy is approximately $6.013\\%$. This is a significant increase from the pretest probability of $1\\%$, but it also highlights that the vast majority of positive tests ($100\\% - 6\\% \\approx 94\\%$) will be false positives in this low-prevalence setting, despite the test's high sensitivity and reasonable specificity.",

It is scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and contains all necessary information to derive a unique solution. The scenario is a straightforward application of arithmetic and summation based on a defined dosing schedule.\n\nThe objective is to compute the total cumulative dose of prednisone administered over an $8$-week period. The calculation can be broken down into two phases: the initial induction phase and the subsequent taper phase. The total cumulative dose, $C_{total}$, is the sum of the doses from all days in the $8$-week plan. Since each week consists of $7$ days, this is equivalent to summing the cumulative doses of each of the $8$ weeks.\n\nLet $D_k$ be the daily dose in milligrams (mg) for week $k$, where $k$ is an integer from $1$ to $8$.
