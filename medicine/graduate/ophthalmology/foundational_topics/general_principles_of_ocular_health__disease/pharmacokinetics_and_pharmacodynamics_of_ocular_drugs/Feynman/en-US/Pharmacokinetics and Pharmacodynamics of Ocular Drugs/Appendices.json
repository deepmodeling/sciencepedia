The association constant is defined by the law of mass action as $K_{m} = \\dfrac{[DM]}{[D][M]}$. Assume that melanin binding sites are in large excess relative to drug such that $[M]$ remains effectively constant during the time scale of elimination, and that binding equilibrates much faster than drug elimination from the tissue.

Round your answer to three significant figures.",
            "solution": "**Part 1: Derivation of the equilibrium bound fraction of drug ($f_b$)**\n\nThe total concentration of the drug, denoted as $[D]_{\\text{total}}$, is the sum of the concentration of free drug, $[D]$, and the concentration of drug bound to melanin, $[DM]$.\n$$[D]_{\\text{total}} = [D] + [DM]$$\nThe bound fraction of the drug, $f_{b}$, is defined as the ratio of the bound drug concentration to the total drug concentration.\n$$f_{b} = \\frac{[DM]}{[D]_{\\text{total}}} = \\frac{[DM]}{[D] + [DM]}$$\nThe problem defines the association constant, $K_{m}$, for the reversible binding equilibrium $D + M \\rightleftharpoons DM$ according to the law of mass action:\n$$K_{m} = \\frac{[DM]}{[D][M]}$$\nHere, $[M]$ is the concentration of free melanin binding sites. We can rearrange this expression to solve for $[DM]$:\n$$[DM] = K_{m} [D] [M]$$\nSubstituting this expression for $[DM]$ into the equation for $f_{b}$ yields:\n$$f_{b} = \\frac{K_{m} [D] [M]}{[D] + K_{m} [D] [M]}$$\nThe term $[D]$ is a common factor in the numerator and the denominator. Assuming $[D]  0$, we can cancel this term:\n$$f_{b} = \\frac{[D] (K_{m} [M])}{[D] (1 + K_{m} [M])} = \\frac{K_{m} [M]}{1 + K_{m} [M]}$$\nThis expression for $f_{b}$ depends only on the association constant $K_{m}$ and the free melanin site concentration $[M]$, as requested. This result is valid under the problem's assumption that $[M]$ is constant due to being in large excess.\n\n**Part 2: Calculation of the numerical value of $f_b$**\n\nThe problem provides the following numerical values:\n-   Association constant, $K_{m} = 1.8 \\times 10^{4} \\ \\mathrm{L} \\ \\mathrm{mol}^{-1}$\n-   Free melanin site concentration, $[M] = 1.0 \\times 10^{-4} \\ \\mathrm{mol} \\ \\mathrm{L}^{-1}$\n\nFirst, calculate the dimensionless product $K_{m} [M]$:\n$$K_{m} [M] = (1.8 \\times 10^{4}) \\times (1.0 \\times 10^{-4}) = 1.8$$\nNow, substitute this value into the derived expression for $f_{b}$:\n$$f_{b} = \\frac{1.8}{1 + 1.8} = \\frac{1.8}{2.8} = \\frac{9}{14}$$\nNumerically, $f_b \\approx 0.643$.\n\n**Part 3: Derivation of apparent kinetics and fold-increase in half-life**\n\nThe problem states that elimination is a first-order process that acts exclusively on the free drug, $[D]$. The rate of change of the total drug concentration is therefore:\n$$\\frac{d[D]_{\\text{total}}}{dt} = -k_{\\text{el}} [D]$$\nwhere $k_{\\text{el}}$ is the first-order elimination rate constant. The assumption that binding equilibrium is rapid compared to elimination allows us to relate $[D]$ to $[D]_{\\text{total}}$ at any time using the unbound fraction, $f_{u}$.\n$$f_{u} = \\frac{[D]}{[D]_{\\text{total}}}$$\nThe unbound fraction is related to the bound fraction by $f_{u} = 1 - f_{b}$. Using the expression for $f_b$ from Part 1:\n$$f_{u} = 1 - \\frac{K_{m} [M]}{1 + K_{m} [M]} = \\frac{(1 + K_{m} [M]) - K_{m} [M]}{1 + K_{m} [M]} = \\frac{1}{1 + K_{m} [M]}$$\nWe can now express the free drug concentration $[D]$ in terms of the total drug concentration $[D]_{\\text{total}}$:\n$$[D] = f_{u} [D]_{\\text{total}} = \\frac{1}{1 + K_{m} [M]} [D]_{\\text{total}}$$\nSubstituting this into the rate equation for total drug elimination:\n$$\\frac{d[D]_{\\text{total}}}{dt} = -k_{\\text{el}} \\left( \\frac{1}{1 + K_{m} [M]} \\right) [D]_{\\text{total}}$$\nThis equation describes a first-order decay process for the total drug concentration, with an apparent rate constant, $k_{\\text{app}}$, defined as:\n$$k_{\\text{app}} = \\frac{k_{\\text{el}}}{1 + K_{m} [M]}$$\nThe half-life ($t_{1/2}$) of a first-order process is given by $t_{1/2} = \\frac{\\ln(2)}{k}$. Therefore, the half-life in the pigmented tissue is:\n$$t_{1/2, \\text{pigmented}} = \\frac{\\ln(2)}{k_{\\text{app}}} = \\frac{\\ln(2)(1 + K_{m} [M])}{k_{\\text{el}}}$$\nFor a hypothetical non-pigmented tissue, the melanin site concentration is $[M] = 0$. Consequently, $K_{m} [M] = 0$, there is no binding ($f_b=0$), and all drug is free ($f_u=1$). The rate constant is simply $k_{\\text{el}}$, and the half-life is:\n$$t_{1/2, \\text{non-pigmented}} = \\frac{\\ln(2)}{k_{\\text{el}}}$$\nThe fold-increase in the elimination half-life is the ratio of the half-life in the pigmented tissue to that in the non-pigmented tissue:\n$$\\text{Fold-increase} = \\frac{t_{1/2, \\text{pigmented}}}{t_{1/2, \\text{non-pigmented}}} = \\frac{\\frac{\\ln(2)(1 + K_{m} [M])}{k_{\\text{el}}}}{\\frac{\\ln(2)}{k_{\\text{el}}}}$$\nCanceling the common terms $\\ln(2)$ and $k_{\\text{el}}$ gives:\n$$\\text{Fold-increase} = 1 + K_{m} [M]$$\nUsing the numerical value for the product $K_{m} [M] = 1.8$ calculated in Part 2:\n$$\\text{Fold-increase} = 1 + 1.8 = 2.8$$\nThe problem requires rounding to three significant figures, which yields $2.80$.",
