            "solution": "The problem is validated as scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. It is based on fundamental principles of paraxial optics and contains sufficient, consistent information for a unique solution. We may proceed.\n\nThe problem is addressed in three parts as requested.\n\n### Part 1: Definition of Optical Power and Diopter\n\nOptical power, denoted by the symbol $F$, is a measure of the degree to which a lens, mirror, or other optical system converges or diverges light. It is defined as the change in the vergence of a wavefront as it passes through the system. Vergence is the reciprocal of the distance from a reference plane to a point of convergence or divergence. For a beam of light originating from an object at a distance $s$ in a medium of refractive index $n$, the object vergence is $V = \\frac{n}{s}$. After passing through an optical system, the light forms an image at a distance $s'$ in a medium of refractive index $n'$, and the image vergence is $V' = \\frac{n'}{s'}$. The power of the system is then given by the relationship $F = V' - V$.\n\nFor a lens in air, the refractive index of the object and image space is approximately $n = n' \\approx 1$. The vergence relation simplifies to $\\frac{1}{s'} - \\frac{1}{s} = F$. By definition, the principal focal length $f$ is the image distance ($s' = f$) for an object at infinity ($s \\to \\infty$). Substituting these into the vergence relation gives $\\frac{1}{f} - \\frac{1}{\\infty} = F$, which simplifies to $F = \\frac{1}{f}$.\n\nDimensionally, focal length $f$ has the dimension of length, which we denote as $[L]$. Consequently, the optical power $F$ has the dimension of inverse length, $[L]^{-1}$.\n\nThe standard unit of optical power is the diopter, abbreviated as $\\mathrm{D}$. The diopter is defined in relation to the International System of Units (SI). If the focal length $f$ is measured in meters ($m$), the power $F$ is in diopters. The relationship is:\n$$1 \\ \\mathrm{D} = 1 \\ m^{-1}$$\n\n### Part 2: Derivation of the Functional Relationship between Focal Length and Power\n\nWe derive the relationship between the focal length $f$ and optical power $F$ for a thin lens in air from the given first principle: the paraxial refraction formula for a single spherical interface.\n$$\n\\frac{n'}{s'}-\\frac{n}{s}=\\frac{n'-n}{R}\n$$\nThis formula can be expressed in terms of vergence. The term $P = \\frac{n'-n}{R}$ represents the optical power of the single refracting surface. The equation becomes $V' - V = P$.\n\nConsider a thin lens of refractive index $n_L$ in air (refractive index $n_{air} \\approx 1$). The lens has two surfaces with radii of curvature $R_1$ (front surface) and $R_2$ (back surface). We use the Cartesian sign convention.\n\n**Refraction at the first surface (air to lens):**\nLight travels from air ($n=1$) to the lens ($n'=n_L$). An object is placed at distance $s_1$ from the first surface. An intermediate image is formed at distance $s'_1$.\nThe vergence equation for this surface is:\n$$\n\\frac{n_L}{s'_1} - \\frac{1}{s_1} = \\frac{n_L - 1}{R_1}\n$$\nThe power of the first surface is $P_1 = \\frac{n_L - 1}{R_1}$.\n\n**Refraction at the second surface (lens to air):**\nThe intermediate image at $s'_1$ serves as the object for the second surface. Due to the thin-lens approximation (the thickness of the lens is negligible), the object distance for the second surface is $s_2 = s'_1$. Light travels from the lens ($n=n_L$) back into air ($n'=1$). A final image is formed at distance $s'_2$.\nThe vergence equation for this surface is:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{s'_2} - \\frac{n_L}{s_2} = \\frac{1 - n_L}{R_2}\n$$\nThe power of the second surface is $P_2 = \\frac{1 - n_L}{R_2}$.\n\n**Combining the surfaces:**\nWe substitute $s_2 = s'_1$ into the second equation:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{s'_2} - \\frac{n_L}{s'_1} = \\frac{1 - n_L}{R_2}\n$$\nNow, we add the equations for the two surfaces:\n$$\n\\left( \\frac{n_L}{s'_1} - \\frac{1}{s_1} \\right) + \\left( \\frac{1}{s'_2} - \\frac{n_L}{s'_1} \\right) = \\left( \\frac{n_L - 1}{R_1} \\right) + \\left( \\frac{1 - n_L}{R_2} \\right)\n$$\nThe terms involving the intermediate image, $\\frac{n_L}{s'_1}$, cancel out. Let the initial object distance be $s=s_1$ and the final image distance be $s'=s'_2$. The equation simplifies to:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{s'} - \\frac{1}{s} = (n_L - 1) \\left( \\frac{1}{R_1} - \\frac{1}{R_2} \\right)\n$$\nThis is the thin-lens equation. The total optical power $F$ of the thin lens is the sum of the powers of its individual surfaces, as requested by the \"vergence addition\" principle.\n$$\nF = P_1 + P_2 = \\frac{n_L - 1}{R_1} + \\frac{1 - n_L}{R_2} = (n_L - 1) \\left( \\frac{1}{R_1} - \\frac{1}{R_2} \\right)\n$$\nComparing the thin-lens equation with the expression for total power, we find:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{s'} - \\frac{1}{s} = F\n$$\nBy the definition of focal length $f$, when the object is at infinity ($s \\to \\infty$), the image is formed at the focal point ($s' = f$). Substituting this into the equation:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{f} - \\frac{1}{\\infty} = F\n$$\nSince $\\frac{1}{\\infty} = 0$, we arrive at the functional relationship between the focal length $f$ of a thin lens in air and its optical power $F$:\n$$\nF = \\frac{1}{f}\n$$\n\n### Part 3: Calculation of Focal Length\n\nWe are given a condensing lens with an optical power $F = +20 \\ \\mathrm{D}$.\nUsing the definition of the diopter, we have $F = +20 \\ m^{-1}$.\nFrom the relationship derived in Part 2, the focal length $f$ is the reciprocal of the power $F$:\n$$\nf = \\frac{1}{F}\n$$\nSubstituting the given value of $F$:\n$$\nf = \\frac{1}{+20 \\ m^{-1}} = 0.05 \\ m\n$$\nThe problem requires the focal length to be expressed in millimeters ($\\mathrm{mm}$). We use the conversion factor $1 \\ m = 1000 \\ \\mathrm{mm}$:\n$$\nf = 0.05 \\ m \\times \\frac{1000 \\ \\mathrm{mm}}{1 \\ m} = 50 \\ \\mathrm{mm}\n$$\nThe final result must be rounded to three significant figures.

The physics is sound.\n- **Well-Posed**: The problem is clearly stated with sufficient assumptions to arrive at a unique, meaningful solution. The key assumption that light from the fundus emerges from the eye as a collimated bundle is the standard simplification for analyzing an emmetropic eye at rest.\n- **Objective**: The language is technical and precise, free from subjectivity.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is deemed valid. It is scientifically sound, well-posed, and objective. A solution will be developed.\n\n### Derivation of Signed Lateral Magnification\n\nWe will adopt the Cartesian sign convention, where light travels from left to right. Heights above the optical axis are positive, and heights below are negative. The optical center of a lens is the origin for its respective object and image distances.\n\nThe overall magnification, $m$, is the ratio of the final aerial image height, $h_{\\text{image}}$, to the initial object height on the retina, $h_{\\text{object}}$.\n$$m = \\frac{h_{\\text{image}}}{h_{\\text{object}}}$$\nThe process can be analyzed in two stages:\n1.  Formation of a collimated beam by the patient's eye.\n2.  Formation of a real image by the condensing lens.\n\n**Stage 1: The Patient's Eye**\nAn object of height $h_{\\text{object}}$ is located on the retina. In an emmetropic reduced eye, the retina is situated at the posterior focal plane. Therefore, light rays originating from any point on the retina will emerge from the eye's optical system as a bundle of parallel rays.\nLet's consider a chief ray from the tip of the object (at height $h_{\\text{object}}$) that travels through the nodal point of the eye's optical system. This ray emerges undeviated. The angle, $\\theta_{\\text{eye}}$, this ray makes with the optical axis is given by the small-angle approximation:\n$$\\theta_{\\text{eye}} \\approx \\tan(\\theta_{\\text{eye}}) = \\frac{h_{\\text{object}}}{f'_{\\text{eye}}}$$\nwhere $f'_{\\text{eye}}$ is the posterior focal length of the eye. The power of the eye, $F_{\\text{eye}}$, is related to its focal length by $F_{\\text{eye}} = \\frac{1}{f'_{\\text{eye}}}$ (assuming the final medium is air, which is the standard convention for equivalent power in diopters, D). Thus, we can express the angle of the emergent collimated beam as:\n$$\\theta_{\\text{eye}} \\approx h_{\\text{object}} F_{\\text{eye}}$$\n\n**Stage 2: The Condensing Lens**\nThis bundle of parallel rays, traveling at an angle $\\theta_{\\text{eye}}$ with respect to the optical axis, is incident upon the condensing lens of power $F_{\\text{lens}}$. A thin lens focuses a parallel bundle of rays to a point in its back focal plane. The height of this image point, $h_{\\text{image}}$, is determined by the ray from the bundle that passes through the optical center of the lens undeviated.\n\nLet $f'_{\\text{lens}}$ be the focal length of the condensing lens, where $f'_{\\text{lens}} = \\frac{1}{F_{\\text{lens}}}$. The image is formed at a distance $f'_{\\text{lens}}$ from the lens. From the geometry, the image height $h_{\\text{image}}$ is related to the incident angle $\\theta_{\\text{eye}}$:\n$$h_{\\text{image}} = f'_{\\text{lens}} \\tan(-\\theta_{\\text{eye}}) \\approx -f'_{\\text{lens}} \\theta_{\\text{eye}}$$\nThe negative sign arises because an incoming beam with a positive angle (from an object above the axis) will focus to a point below the axis, resulting in an inverted image.\n\nSubstituting $f'_{\\text{lens}} = \\frac{1}{F_{\\text{lens}}}$, we get:\n$$h_{\\text{image}} \\approx -\\frac{\\theta_{\\text{eye}}}{F_{\\text{lens}}}$$\n\n**Overall Magnification**\nNow we combine the expressions. Substitute $\\theta_{\\text{eye}} \\approx h_{\\text{object}} F_{\\text{eye}}$ into the equation for $h_{\\text{image}}$:\n$$h_{\\text{image}} \\approx -\\frac{h_{\\text{object}} F_{\\text{eye}}}{F_{\\text{lens}}}$$\nThe signed lateral magnification $m$ is then:\n$$m = \\frac{h_{\\text{image}}}{h_{\\text{object}}} \\approx \\frac{-h_{\\text{object}} F_{\\text{eye}} / F_{\\text{lens}}}{h_{\\text{object}}}$$\nThis simplifies to the final expression:\n$$m = -\\frac{F_{\\text{eye}}}{F_{\\text{lens}}}$$\n\n### Numerical Calculation\n\nGiven $F_{\\text{eye}} = +60\\ \\text{D}$. We calculate the magnification $m$ for the three given condensing lens powers.\n\n1.  For $F_{\\text{lens}} = +14\\ \\text{D}$:\n    $$m_1 = -\\frac{60}{14} \\approx -4.2857...$$\n    Rounding to three significant figures, $m_1 = -4.29$.\n\n2.  For $F_{\\text{lens}} = +20\\ \\text{D}$:\n    $$m_2 = -\\frac{60}{20} = -3$$\n    Expressing to three significant figures, $m_2 = -3.00$.\n\n3.  For $F_{\\text{lens}} = +28\\ \\text{D}$:\n    $$m_3 = -\\frac{60}{28} \\approx -2.1428...$$\n    Rounding to three significant figures, $m_3 = -2.14$.\n\nThe final answer is the row vector of these three signed magnification values.\n\n### Interpretation of Results\n\nThe derived formula $m = -F_{\\text{eye}} / F_{\\text{lens}}$ and the calculated values provide insight into the clinical use of different condensing lenses.\n\n-   **Image Orientation (Sign):** The consistent negative sign of the magnification ($m = -4.29$, $m = -3.00$, $m = -2.14$) confirms that the aerial image formed is always inverted relative to the retinal object. This is a defining characteristic of indirect ophthalmoscopy; the examiner sees an upside-down and mirror-reversed view of the fundus and must be trained to mentally reorient the image.\n\n-   **Magnification and Field of View (Magnitude):** The magnitude of the magnification, $|m|$, is inversely proportional to the power of the condensing lens, $F_{\\text{lens}}$.\n    -   The low-power $+14\\ \\text{D}$ lens provides the highest magnification ($|m| = 4.29$). This is useful for detailed examination of specific structures like the optic nerve head or macula.\n    -   The high-power $+28\\ \\text{D}$ lens provides the lowest magnification ($|m| = 2.14$).\n    -   In optics, there is a fundamental trade-off between magnification and field of view. A lower magnification inherently provides a wider field of view. Therefore, the $+28\\ \\text{D}$ lens is ideal for general screening and surveying the peripheral retina, while the $+14\\ \\text{D}$ lens is a high-detail, narrow-field instrument. The $+20\\ \\text{D}$ lens offers a popular balance between these two extremes.\n\n-   **Working Distance:** The working distance for the examiner is related to the focal length of the condensing lens ($f'_{\\text{lens}} = 1/F_{\\text{lens}}$), as the aerial image is formed at this distance from the lens.\n    -   For the $+14\\ \\text{D}$ lens, $f'_{\\text{lens}} = 1/14 \\text{ m} \\approx 7.1 \\text{ cm}$.\n    -   For the $+28\\ \\text{D}$ lens, $f'_{\\text{lens}} = 1/28 \\text{ m} \\approx 3.6 \\text{ cm}$.\n    A higher-power lens has a shorter focal length, requiring the examiner to work closer to the patient, which can be less comfortable. A lower-power lens allows for a more comfortable, longer working distance.",

Therefore, the problem is deemed valid and a full solution is warranted.\n\nThe solution involves applying the principles of vergence propagation through a uniform medium and the thin lens equation in vergence form. The vergence, $V$, of a bundle of rays at a given plane is defined in diopters (D), where $1\\ \\mathrm{D} = 1\\ \\mathrm{m}^{-1}$. The relevant equations are:\n1.  **Vergence at the cornea ($V_C$)**: For an ametropic eye with refractive error $K$ (in diopters), the vergence of light emerging from the cornea is given by $V_C = -K$.\n2.  **Vergence Propagation**: The vergence $V_{in}$ of light incident on the condensing lens, after propagating a distance $d$ in air (refractive index $n=1$) from the corneal plane where the vergence is $V_C$, is given by the transfer equation:\n    $$V_{in} = \\frac{V_C}{1 - d \\cdot V_C}$$\n3.  **Thin Lens Equation**: The vergence $V_{out}$ of light emerging from a thin lens of power $P_L$ is related to the incident vergence $V_{in}$ by:\n    $$V_{out} = V_{in} + P_L$$\n4.  **Image Position**: The axial position $s^{\\prime}$ of the image formed by the light exiting the lens is the reciprocal of the exit vergence:\n    $$s^{\\prime} = \\frac{1}{V_{out}}$$\n\nThe given parameters are:\n-   Lens power, $P_L = +20\\ \\mathrm{D}$.\n-   Lens-to-cornea separation, $d = 0.050\\ \\mathrm{m}$.\n-   Refractive error for the hyperopic eye, $K_{hyperope} = +5\\ \\mathrm{D}$.\n-   Refractive error for the emmetropic eye, $K_{emmetrope} = 0\\ \\mathrm{D}$.\n\n**Case 1: Emmetropic Eye**\n\nFor an emmetropic eye, the refractive error is $K_{emmetrope} = 0\\ \\mathrm{D}$.\nThe vergence of light at the corneal plane is:\n$$V_C = -K_{emmetrope} = 0\\ \\mathrm{D}$$\nThis indicates that parallel rays (collimated light) emerge from the eye. The vergence of these rays remains zero as they propagate to the condensing lens. Therefore, the vergence incident on the lens is:\n$$V_{in, emmetrope} = 0\\ \\mathrm{D}$$\nThe vergence of light exiting the lens is found using the thin lens equation:\n$$V_{out, emmetrope} = V_{in, emmetrope} + P_L = 0\\ \\mathrm{D} + 20\\ \\mathrm{D} = +20\\ \\mathrm{D}$$\nThe axial position of the aerial image, $s^{\\prime}_{emmetrope}$, relative to the lens is the reciprocal of the exit vergence:\n$$s^{\\prime}_{emmetrope} = \\frac{1}{V_{out, emmetrope}} = \\frac{1}{20\\ \\mathrm{D}} = 0.050\\ \\mathrm{m}$$\nThis result is expected, as collimated light incident on a positive lens focuses at its focal plane.\n\n**Case 2: Hyperopic Eye**\n\nFor the patient with hyperopia, the refractive error is $K_{hyperope} = +5\\ \\mathrm{D}$.\nThe vergence of light at the corneal plane is:\n$$V_C = -K_{hyperope} = -5\\ \\mathrm{D}$$\nThis indicates that the light emerges from the eye as a diverging beam.

We analyze the expression for $s^{\\prime}_{hyperope}$ as a function of $d$:\n$$s^{\\prime}_{hyperope}(d) = \\frac{1}{\\frac{V_C}{1 - d \\cdot V_C} + P_L}$$\nFor this hyperopic case, $V_C = -5\\ \\mathrm{D}$ is negative. The shift is $\\Delta s^{\\prime}(d) = s^{\\prime}_{hyperope}(d) - s^{\\prime}_{emmetrope}$. To reduce $|\\Delta s^{\\prime}|$, we need $s^{\\prime}_{hyperope}(d)$ to approach $s^{\\prime}_{emmetrope} = \\frac{1}{P_L}$. This happens when the incident vergence on the lens, $V_{in, hyperope}$, approaches the emmetropic incident vergence, which is $0\\ \\mathrm{D}$.\n\nLet's examine $V_{in, hyperope} = \\frac{V_C}{1-dV_C}$.\nAs $d$ increases, the denominator $1-dV_C = 1+d|V_C|$ increases. Consequently, the magnitude of the incident vergence, $|V_{in, hyperope}| = \\frac{|V_C|}{1+d|V_C|}$, decreases and approaches $0$. As $V_{in, hyperope}$ approaches $0\\ \\mathrm{D}$, $s^{\\prime}_{hyperope}$ approaches $s^{\\prime}_{emmetrope}$.\nConversely, as $d$ decreases, the denominator $1+d|V_C|$ decreases (approaching $1$ as $d \\to 0$), so $|V_{in, hyperope}|$ increases (approaching $|V_C|$). This moves $s^{\\prime}_{hyperope}$ further away from $s^{\\prime}_{emmetrope}$.\nTherefore, for this hyperopic case, **increasing** the lens-to-cornea distance $d$ would reduce the magnitude of the axial image shift $|\\Delta s^{\\prime}|$.",
