            "solution": "Begin with Fick’s first law for the mass flux of a dilute species in a stagnant gas adjacent to the tear-air interface.

Substituting into Fick’s law yields\n$$\nJ \\approx D_{v}\\frac{\\rho_{s}-\\rho_{\\infty}}{\\delta}.\n$$\nThis motivates the definition of an effective mass transfer coefficient $k$ by $k\\equiv D_{v}/\\delta$ in the purely diffusive case. When air-side convection enhances transfer, $k$ increases according to boundary-layer theory and can be related to the Sherwood number (Sh) via $\\mathrm{Sh}=kL/D_{v}$ for characteristic length $L$. Thus, a linear driving-force expression emerges:\n$$\nJ=k(\\rho_{s}-\\rho_{\\infty}).\n$$\nIn the ocular microenvironment, the interfacial vapor density $\\rho_{s}$ is not simply the saturation density at the ocular surface temperature $T_{\\mathrm{ocular}}$; it is modulated by the water activity $a_{w}$ of the tear liquid, which accounts for solute effects. Thermodynamically, a Raoult’s law–type relation gives\n$$\n\\rho_{s}=a_{w}\\,\\rho_{\\mathrm{sat}}(T_{\\mathrm{ocular}}),\n$$\nwhere $\\rho_{\\mathrm{sat}}(T)$ is the saturation vapor density at temperature $T$, and $a_{w}\\leq 1$ decreases with increasing solute mole fraction (e.g., hyperosmolar tears, elevated salt content).

Treating resistances in series, the net coefficient is\n$$\n\\frac{1}{k_{\\mathrm{eff}}}=\\frac{1}{k_{\\mathrm{air}}}+\\frac{1}{k_{\\mathrm{lipid}}},\n$$\nso that an increase in interfacial resistance from the lipid layer decreases $k_{\\mathrm{eff}}$ and thereby lowers $J$ for a given $(\\rho_{s}-\\rho_{\\infty})$. The lipid layer’s dominant effect is barrier-like (transport resistance) rather than a significant change in water activity; $a_{w}$ is primarily governed by dissolved solutes in the aqueous tear phase. Additionally, small changes in $T_{\\mathrm{ocular}}$ can modulate $\\rho_{\\mathrm{sat}}(T_{\\mathrm{ocular}})$, but the principal role of meibum in evaporation is reduction of the effective mass transfer coefficient.\n\nUnits and consistency: $J$ has units $\\mathrm{kg}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-2}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$, $k$ has units $\\mathrm{m}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$, and both $\\rho_{s}$ and $\\rho_{\\infty}$ have units $\\mathrm{kg}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-3}$.\n\nOption-by-option analysis:\n\nA.

It also correctly attributes the Meibomian lipid layer’s effect to increasing interfacial resistance (decreasing $k$), and notes that hyperosmolar tears reduce $a_{w}$ and hence $\\rho_{s}$. This aligns precisely with the derivation and ocular context. Verdict: Correct.\n\nB. This option mixes thermal and mass transfer concepts, using $k$ as thermal conductivity and introducing $h_{t}$ (tear film thickness) into a mass transfer expression. It misdefines $\\rho_{s}$ as tear osmolarity (an intensive property of the liquid phase, not a vapor density) and $\\rho_{\\infty}$ as ambient relative humidity alone (dimensionless) without converting to vapor density. It also claims Meibomian lipids increase $h_{t}$ to increase $J$, which is opposite to the barrier effect that reduces $k$. Units are inconsistent: thermal conductivity and film thickness do not belong in this linear mass-transfer expression in the provided manner. Verdict: Incorrect.\n\nC. This option reverses the driving-force sign to $k(\\rho_{\\infty}-\\rho_{s})$, which would predict negative flux out of the eye when $\\rho_{s}>\\rho_{\\infty}$ under typical evaporation conditions. It further misdefines $k$ as hydraulic conductivity (a liquid-phase parameter relevant to pressure-driven flow, not vapor diffusion), $\\rho_{s}$ as the liquid density, and $\\rho_{\\infty}$ as the bulk air density, none of which are the appropriate vapor densities. It also incorrectly characterizes the lipid layer as a sink that reduces $\\rho_{s}$. Verdict: Incorrect.\n\nD. This option introduces a nonphysical squared term $\\rho_{\\infty}^{2}$ within the driving force, and treats $\\rho_{\\infty}$ as dimensionless relative humidity, which would be incompatible with the units of $\\rho_{s}$ unless converted appropriately. It sets $k=D_{v}$, ignoring boundary-layer thickness or convective enhancement, and incorrectly asserts that Meibomian lipids increase $\\rho_{s}$; the lipid layer’s primary effect is on resistance, not raising interfacial vapor density. Verdict: Incorrect.\n\nE. While a pressure-based formulation can exist in gas-phase mass transfer when linked through an appropriate coefficient and the ideal gas law, this option defines $J$ as a volumetric liquid flux in $\\mathrm{m}^{3}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-2}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$ instead of a mass flux, misattributes $k$ to tear viscosity rather than to gas-phase mass transfer, and uses vapor pressures without specifying the conversion to densities or an appropriate $k_{p}$ based on partial pressures. It also claims the lipid layer lowers $\\rho_{s}$ by increasing viscosity, which conflates liquid rheology with gas-phase interfacial thermodynamics. Consequently, units and physics are inconsistent with the derived expression. Verdict: Incorrect.",

It is therefore **valid**. I will proceed with the derivation and solution.\n\n### Derivation from First Principles\nThe observed dominant hue in reflection is due to constructive interference of light waves reflecting from the two interfaces of the lipid film. Let $t$ be the thickness of the lipid film. The system consists of three media: air ($n_{\\text{air}}=1.00$), lipid ($n_{\\text{lipid}}=1.48$), and aqueous ($n_{\\text{aqueous}}=1.336$).\n\n1.  **Phase shifts upon reflection:** We must analyze the phase shift of light reflecting at each interface. A phase shift of $\\pi$ radians (equivalent to a path difference of $\\lambda/2$) occurs when light reflects off a medium with a higher refractive index.\n    -   **Interface 1 (Air-Lipid):** Light travels from air ($n_{\\text{air}}=1.00$) to lipid ($n_{\\text{lipid}}=1.48$). Since $n_{\\text{lipid}} > n_{\\text{air}}$, the reflection at this top surface induces a phase shift of $\\pi$.\n    -   **Interface 2 (Lipid-Aqueous):** Light travels from lipid ($n_{\\text{lipid}}=1.48$) to the aqueous sublayer ($n_{\\text{aqueous}}=1.336$). Since $n_{\\text{aqueous}} < n_{\\text{lipid}}$, the reflection at this bottom surface induces no phase shift ($0$ radians).\n\n2.  **Optical Path Difference (OPD):** A light ray (Ray 2) that enters the film travels a distance of $t$ down and $t$ up before exiting. Since this occurs within the lipid medium, the total optical path difference due to travel, for normal incidence, is $2n_{\\text{lipid}}t$.\n\n3.  **Condition for Constructive Interference:** Constructive interference, which results in a bright reflection for a given wavelength $\\lambda$, occurs when the total phase difference between the ray reflected at the first interface (Ray 1) and the ray reflected at the second interface (Ray 2) is an integer multiple of $2\\pi$. The total phase difference is the sum of the phase difference from the OPD and the net phase shift from reflections.\n\n    The total phase difference $\\Delta\\phi$ is:\n    $$ \\Delta\\phi = \\left(\\frac{2\\pi}{\\lambda}\\right) \\times (\\text{OPD}) + (\\text{Phase Shift at Interface 1}) - (\\text{Phase Shift at Interface 2}) $$\n    $$ \\Delta\\phi = \\left(\\frac{2\\pi}{\\lambda}\\right) (2n_{\\text{lipid}}t) + \\pi - 0 = \\frac{4\\pi n_{\\text{lipid}}t}{\\lambda} + \\pi $$\n    For constructive interference, $\\Delta\\phi = 2k\\pi$ for some integer $k$. To ensure a non-negative thickness, we require $k \\ge 1$.\n    $$ \\frac{4\\pi n_{\\text{lipid}}t}{\\lambda} + \\pi = 2k\\pi $$\n    Dividing by $\\pi$:\n    $$ \\frac{4n_{\\text{lipid}}t}{\\lambda} + 1 = 2k $$\n    $$ \\frac{4n_{\\text{lipid}}t}{\\lambda} = 2k - 1 $$\n    $$ 2n_{\\text{lipid}}t = (k - 1/2)\\lambda $$\n    To align with the standard convention using a non-negative integer index $m = 0, 1, 2, \\ldots$, we can set $m = k-1$. This transforms the condition into:\n    $$ 2n_{\\text{lipid}}t = (m + 1/2)\\lambda, \\quad m = 0, 1, 2, \\ldots $$\n    This is the condition for constructive interference.\n\n4.  **Mapping and Thickness Calculation:**\n    The relationship derived provides the mapping from the dominant reflected wavelength $\\lambda$ (associated with a hue $h$) to the film thickness $t$.\n    $$ t(h) = t(\\lambda) = \\frac{(m + 1/2)\\lambda}{2n_{\\text{lipid}}} $$\n    We are given $\\lambda_{\\text{green}} = 530\\,\\text{nm}$ and $n_{\\text{lipid}} = 1.48$. The physiological range is $20\\,\\text{nm} \\le t \\le 120\\,\\text{nm}$. We must find the lowest non-negative integer $m$ that yields a thickness within this range.\n\n    -   For $m=0$:\n        $$ t = \\frac{(0 + 1/2) \\times 530\\,\\text{nm}}{2 \\times 1.48} = \\frac{0.5 \\times 530\\,\\text{nm}}{2.96} = \\frac{265\\,\\text{nm}}{2.96} \\approx 89.527\\,\\text{nm} $$\n        This value, $t \\approx 89.5\\,\\text{nm}$, lies within the specified physiological range of $20\\,\\text{nm}$ to $120\\,\\text{nm}$.\n\n    -   For $m=1$:\n        $$ t = \\frac{(1 + 1/2) \\times 530\\,\\text{nm}}{2 \\times 1.48} = \\frac{1.5 \\times 530\\,\\text{nm}}{2.96} = \\frac{795\\,\\text{nm}}{2.96} \\approx 268.58\\,\\text{nm} $$\n        This value is outside the physiological range. All higher values of $m$ will also result in thicknesses outside the range.\n\n    Therefore, the only plausible thickness corresponds to the $m=0$ interference order, yielding $t \\approx 89.5\\,\\text{nm}$.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. $t(h)=\\dfrac{(m+1/2)\\,\\lambda(h)}{2\\,n_{\\text{lipid}}}$ with the lowest nonnegative integer $m$ yielding a thickness in the physiological range; for $\\lambda_{\\text{green}}=530\\,\\text{nm}$ and $m=0$, $t\\approx 89.5\\,\\text{nm}$.**\n- **Formula:** The formula $t = \\frac{(m+1/2)\\lambda}{2n_{\\text{lipid}}}$ is identical to the one derived from first principles for constructive interference in this specific layered system.\n- **Methodology:** The instruction to use the lowest non-negative integer $m$ that places the thickness in the physiological range is the correct physical interpretation. Our analysis confirmed that $m=0$ is the appropriate choice.\n- **Calculation:** The computed thickness for $\\lambda = 530\\,\\text{nm}$ and $m=0$ is $t \\approx 89.5\\,\\text{nm}$, which matches our derivation.\n- **Verdict:** **Correct**.\n\n**B. $t(h)=\\dfrac{m\\,\\lambda(h)}{2\\,n_{\\text{lipid}}}$ with the lowest positive integer $m$; for $\\lambda_{\\text{green}}=530\\,\\text{nm}$ and $m=1$, $t\\approx 179.0\\,\\text{nm}$.**\n- **Formula:** The formula $t = \\frac{m\\lambda}{2n_{\\text{lipid}}}$ corresponds to the condition for *destructive* interference ($2n_{\\text{lipid}}t = m\\lambda$). A dominant observed hue requires constructive interference, not destructive. The formula is fundamentally incorrect for this problem.\n- **Physiological Constraint:** The calculated value $t \\approx 179.0\\,\\text{nm}$ is far outside the specified physiological range of $20$–$120\\,\\text{nm}$.\n- **Verdict:** **Incorrect**.\n\n**C. $t(h)=\\dfrac{(m+1/2)\\,\\lambda(h)}{2\\,n_{\\text{aqueous}}}$ with the lowest nonnegative integer $m$; for $\\lambda_{\\text{green}}=530\\,\\text{nm}$ and $m=0$, $t\\approx 99.2\\,\\text{nm}$.**\n- **Formula:** This option incorrectly uses the refractive index of the aqueous sublayer, $n_{\\text{aqueous}}$, in the denominator. The optical path difference is determined by the medium the light travels through, which is the lipid film. Thus, $n_{\\text{lipid}}$ must be used.\n- **Verdict:** **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. $t(h)=\\dfrac{(m+1/2)\\,\\lambda(h)}{2\\,n_{\\text{lipid}}\\cos\\theta}$ taking $\\theta=30^\\circ$ as the incidence angle in air; for $\\lambda_{\\text{green}}=530\\,\\text{nm}$ and $m=0$, $t\\approx 103.4\\,\\text{nm}$.**\n- **Formula:** The problem explicitly states to \"assume normal incidence\". For normal incidence, the angle of incidence is $0^\\circ$, and the factor of $\\cos\\theta$ becomes $\\cos(0^\\circ) = 1$. Introducing a non-zero angle $\\theta=30^\\circ$ directly contradicts the problem statement. Furthermore, the correct formula for non-normal incidence involves the cosine of the angle of refraction inside the film, not the angle of incidence in air.\n- **Verdict:** **Incorrect**.",
