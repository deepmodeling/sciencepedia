It presents a standard biophysical model of ion channel function and asks for a quantitative comparison between a wild-type and a mutant channel based on specific parameter changes.\n\nThe macroscopic current, $I$, through a population of ion channels is given by the general relation:\n$$I = N\\,g\\,P_{\\mathrm{open}}(c)\\,(V_{m}-E_{\\mathrm{rev}})$$\nwhere $N$ is the number of functional channels, $g$ is the single-channel conductance, $P_{\\mathrm{open}}(c)$ is the open probability as a function of the cGMP concentration $c$, $V_{m}$ is the membrane potential, and $E_{\\mathrm{rev}}$ is the reversal potential for the channel.\n\nThe open probability is described by the Hill equation, a standard model for cooperative binding and activation:\n$$P_{\\mathrm{open}}(c) = \\dfrac{c^{n}}{c^{n} + K_{1/2}^{n}}$$\nwhere $n$ is the Hill coefficient and $K_{1/2}$ is the cGMP concentration for half-maximal activation.\n\nWe are tasked with comparing a wild-type (wt) system with a mutant (mut) system. The problem specifies the following relationships between the parameters for the two systems:\n- The single-channel conductance of the mutant is reduced by $30\\%$, so $g^{\\mathrm{mut}} = (1 - 0.3) g^{\\mathrm{wt}} = 0.7 g^{\\mathrm{wt}}$.\n- The number of channels, gating parameters (which determine the $P_{\\mathrm{open}}(c)$ function), membrane potential, and reversal potential are unchanged. Thus, $N^{\\mathrm{mut}} = N^{\\mathrm{wt}}$, $n^{\\mathrm{mut}} = n^{\\mathrm{wt}}$, $K_{1/2}^{\\mathrm{mut}} = K_{1/2}^{\\mathrm{wt}}$, $V_{m}^{\\mathrm{mut}} = V_{m}^{\\mathrm{wt}}$, and $E_{\\mathrm{rev}}^{\\mathrm{mut}} = E_{\\mathrm{rev}}^{\\mathrm{wt}}$.\n- The dark ($c_{d}$) and post-flash ($c_{f}$) cGMP concentrations are determined by the biochemical cascade and are assumed to be unaffected by the mutation in channel conductance.\n\nFirst, we will derive the ratio of the mutant to wild-type dark current magnitudes, $\\dfrac{|I_{\\mathrm{dark}}^{\\mathrm{mut}}|}{|I_{\\mathrm{dark}}^{\\mathrm{wt}}|}$. The dark current, $I_{\\mathrm{dark}}$, is the current observed at the dark cGMP concentration, $c_{d}$.\n\nThe wild-type dark current is expressed as:\n$$I_{\\mathrm{dark}}^{\\mathrm{wt}} = N^{\\mathrm{wt}} g^{\\mathrm{wt}} P_{\\mathrm{open}}^{\\mathrm{wt}}(c_{d}) (V_{m}^{\\mathrm{wt}} - E_{\\mathrm{rev}}^{\\mathrm{wt}})$$\nThe mutant dark current is expressed as:\n$$I_{\\mathrm{dark}}^{\\mathrm{mut}} = N^{\\mathrm{mut}} g^{\\mathrm{mut}} P_{\\mathrm{open}}^{\\mathrm{mut}}(c_{d}) (V_{m}^{\\mathrm{mut}} - E_{\\mathrm{rev}}^{\\mathrm{mut}})$$\nSince the parameters $n$ and $K_{1/2}$ that define the open probability function are unchanged, the function $P_{\\mathrm{open}}(c)$ is identical for both wild-type and mutant.

Let's denote this common value as $P_{\\mathrm{open}}(c_d)$.\n\nThe ratio of the dark current magnitudes is:\n$$\\dfrac{|I_{\\mathrm{dark}}^{\\mathrm{mut}}|}{|I_{\\mathrm{dark}}^{\\mathrm{wt}}|} = \\dfrac{|N^{\\mathrm{mut}} g^{\\mathrm{mut}} P_{\\mathrm{open}}(c_{d}) (V_{m}^{\\mathrm{mut}} - E_{\\mathrm{rev}}^{\\mathrm{mut}})|}{|N^{\\mathrm{wt}} g^{\\mathrm{wt}} P_{\\mathrm{open}}(c_{d}) (V_{m}^{\\mathrm{wt}} - E_{\\mathrm{rev}}^{\\mathrm{wt}})|}$$\nSubstituting the known equalities ($N^{\\mathrm{mut}} = N^{\\mathrm{wt}}$, $V_{m}^{\\mathrm{mut}} = V_{m}^{\\mathrm{wt}}$, $E_{\\mathrm{rev}}^{\\mathrm{mut}} = E_{\\mathrm{rev}}^{\\mathrm{wt}}$) allows for the cancellation of these terms:\n$$\\dfrac{|I_{\\mathrm{dark}}^{\\mathrm{mut}}|}{|I_{\\mathrm{dark}}^{\\mathrm{wt}}|} = \\dfrac{|g^{\\mathrm{mut}}|}{|g^{\\mathrm{wt}}|}$$\nGiven that $g^{\\mathrm{mut}} = 0.7 g^{\\mathrm{wt}}$, and conductance $g$ is a positive physical quantity, the ratio becomes:\n$$\\dfrac{|I_{\\mathrm{dark}}^{\\mathrm{mut}}|}{|I_{\\mathrm{dark}}^{\\mathrm{wt}}|} = \\dfrac{0.7 g^{\\mathrm{wt}}}{g^{\\mathrm{wt}}} = 0.7 = \\dfrac{7}{10}$$\n\nNext, we derive the ratio of the mutant to wild-type peak flash-induced current suppression amplitudes, $\\dfrac{\\Delta I^{\\mathrm{mut}}}{\\Delta I^{\\mathrm{wt}}}$. The suppression amplitude is defined as $\\Delta I \\equiv I_{\\mathrm{dark}} - I_{\\mathrm{flash}}$. The flash current, $I_{\\mathrm{flash}}$, is the current at the post-flash cGMP concentration, $c_{f}$.\n\nThe wild-type suppression amplitude is:\n$$\\Delta I^{\\mathrm{wt}} = I_{\\mathrm{dark}}^{\\mathrm{wt}} - I_{\\mathrm{flash}}^{\\mathrm{wt}}$$\n$$\\Delta I^{\\mathrm{wt}} = [N^{\\mathrm{wt}} g^{\\mathrm{wt}} P_{\\mathrm{open}}(c_{d}) (V_{m}^{\\mathrm{wt}} - E_{\\mathrm{rev}}^{\\mathrm{wt}})] - [N^{\\mathrm{wt}} g^{\\mathrm{wt}} P_{\\mathrm{open}}(c_{f}) (V_{m}^{\\mathrm{wt}} - E_{\\mathrm{rev}}^{\\mathrm{wt}})]$$\nFactoring out the common terms from this expression gives:\n$$\\Delta I^{\\mathrm{wt}} = N^{\\mathrm{wt}} g^{\\mathrm{wt}} (V_{m}^{\\mathrm{wt}} - E_{\\mathrm{rev}}^{\\mathrm{wt}}) [P_{\\mathrm{open}}(c_{d}) - P_{\\mathrm{open}}(c_{f})]$$\nSimilarly, the mutant suppression amplitude is:\n$$\\Delta I^{\\mathrm{mut}} = I_{\\mathrm{dark}}^{\\mathrm{mut}} - I_{\\mathrm{flash}}^{\\mathrm{mut}}$$\n$$\\Delta I^{\\mathrm{mut}} = [N^{\\mathrm{mut}} g^{\\mathrm{mut}} P_{\\mathrm{open}}(c_{d}) (V_{m}^{\\mathrm{mut}} - E_{\\mathrm{rev}}^{\\mathrm{mut}})] - [N^{\\mathrm{mut}} g^{\\mathrm{mut}} P_{\\mathrm{open}}(c_{f}) (V_{m}^{\\mathrm{mut}} - E_{\\mathrm{rev}}^{\\mathrm{mut}})]$$\nFactoring out the common terms:\n$$\\Delta I^{\\mathrm{mut}} = N^{\\mathrm{mut}} g^{\\mathrm{mut}} (V_{m}^{\\mathrm{mut}} - E_{\\mathrm{rev}}^{\\mathrm{mut}}) [P_{\\mathrm{open}}(c_{d}) - P_{\\mathrm{open}}(c_{f})]$$\n\nTo find the required ratio, we divide the expression for $\\Delta I^{\\mathrm{mut}}$ by that for $\\Delta I^{\\mathrm{wt}}$:\n$$\\dfrac{\\Delta I^{\\mathrm{mut}}}{\\Delta I^{\\mathrm{wt}}} = \\dfrac{N^{\\mathrm{mut}} g^{\\mathrm{mut}} (V_{m}^{\\mathrm{mut}} - E_{\\mathrm{rev}}^{\\mathrm{mut}}) [P_{\\mathrm{open}}(c_{d}) - P_{\\mathrm{open}}(c_{f})]}{N^{\\mathrm{wt}} g^{\\mathrm{wt}} (V_{m}^{\\mathrm{wt}} - E_{\\mathrm{rev}}^{\\mathrm{wt}}) [P_{\\mathrm{open}}(c_{d}) - P_{\\mathrm{open}}(c_{f})]}$$\nAgain, we employ the given equalities. The terms $N$, $(V_m - E_{rev})$, and the entire term $[P_{\\mathrm{open}}(c_{d}) - P_{\\mathrm{open}}(c_{f})]$ are identical for both numerator and denominator and thus cancel. This leaves:\n$$\\dfrac{\\Delta I^{\\mathrm{mut}}}{\\Delta I^{\\mathrm{wt}}} = \\dfrac{g^{\\mathrm{mut}}}{g^{\\mathrm{wt}}}$$\nAs established previously, this ratio evaluates to:\n$$\\dfrac{\\Delta I^{\\mathrm{mut}}}{\\Delta I^{\\mathrm{wt}}} = \\dfrac{0.7 g^{\\mathrm{wt}}}{g^{\\mathrm{wt}}} = 0.7 = \\dfrac{7}{10}$$\nBoth ratios are identical because both the standing dark current and the light-induced absolute change in current are linearly proportional to the single-channel conductance, $g$, which is the only parameter affecting the current amplitude that is altered by the mutation.\n\nThe final answers for the ratio of dark currents and the ratio of flash-induced current suppressions are $\\dfrac{7}{10}$ and $\\dfrac{7}{10}$, respectively.",
