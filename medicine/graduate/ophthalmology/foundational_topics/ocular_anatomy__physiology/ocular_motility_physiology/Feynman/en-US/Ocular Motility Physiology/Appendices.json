This exercise demonstrates how the torque generated by a muscle is not just a function of its force, but also of its 'moment arm'—the effective lever arm that changes with eye position. By working through this problem , you will gain a concrete understanding of how the biomechanics of the orbit influence the efficacy of muscle action.",

            "problem": "In ocular motility physiology, the torque about the ocular globe’s center of rotation generated by an Extraocular Muscle (EOM) is determined by the perpendicular distance from the muscle’s line of action to the center of rotation, known as the moment arm. The magnitude of torque is defined by the product of the applied force and this moment arm. Consider the medial rectus muscle in primary gaze with a moment arm of $r_{0} = 11\\,\\mathrm{mm}$. Due to geometric changes in muscle path with eye position, suppose that at $25^{\\circ}$ adduction the moment arm decreases by $10\\%$ relative to primary gaze. Assume the muscle force remains constant at $F = 1.5\\,\\mathrm{N}$ across this range.\n\nStarting from the fundamental definition of torque as the product of force and perpendicular lever arm, derive an expression for the change in torque $\\Delta \\tau = \\tau_{\\mathrm{adduction}} - \\tau_{\\mathrm{primary}}$ in terms of $F$ and the moment arm values, and compute its numerical value given the above data. Express the final change in torque in $\\mathrm{N\\cdot m}$ and round your answer to four significant figures.",
            "solution": "The problem is first validated against the required criteria.\n\n### Step 1: Extract Givens\n- Definition of torque: $\\tau = F \\times r$, where $\\tau$ is torque, $F$ is applied force, and $r$ is the perpendicular moment arm.\n- Moment arm in primary gaze: $r_{0} = 11\\,\\mathrm{mm}$, which will be denoted as $r_{\\mathrm{primary}}$.\n- Condition for moment arm change: At $25^{\\circ}$ adduction, the moment arm decreases by $10\\%$ relative to the primary gaze value.\n- Muscle force (assumed constant): $F = 1.5\\,\\mathrm{N}$.\n- Quantity to be determined: The change in torque, $\\Delta \\tau = \\tau_{\\mathrm{adduction}} - \\tau_{\\mathrm{primary}}$.\n- Final numerical format: The value must be in units of $\\mathrm{N\\cdot m}$ and rounded to four significant figures.\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\n- **Scientific Grounding**: The problem is grounded in fundamental classical mechanics (definition of torque) and applied to a standard biomechanical model in ocular physiology.

A solution will be derived.\n\nThe torque, $\\tau$, is defined as the product of the force, $F$, and the perpendicular moment arm, $r$.\n$$ \\tau = F \\times r $$\nThe torque in primary gaze, $\\tau_{\\mathrm{primary}}$, is calculated using the moment arm in primary gaze, $r_{\\mathrm{primary}}$.\n$$ \\tau_{\\mathrm{primary}} = F \\times r_{\\mathrm{primary}} $$\nThe torque in adduction, $\\tau_{\\mathrm{adduction}}$, is calculated using the moment arm in adduction, $r_{\\mathrm{adduction}}$.\n$$ \\tau_{\\mathrm{adduction}} = F \\times r_{\\mathrm{adduction}} $$\nWe are given the moment arm in primary gaze:\n$$ r_{\\mathrm{primary}} = r_{0} = 11\\,\\mathrm{mm} $$\nThe moment arm in adduction, $r_{\\mathrm{adduction}}$, is stated to be a $10\\%$ decrease from the primary gaze value. A decrease of $10\\%$ means the new value is $100\\% - 10\\% = 90\\%$ of the original value.\n$$ r_{\\mathrm{adduction}} = (1 - 0.10) \\times r_{\\mathrm{primary}} = 0.90 \\times r_{\\mathrm{primary}} $$\nThe problem asks for the change in torque, $\\Delta \\tau$, defined as:\n$$ \\Delta \\tau = \\tau_{\\mathrm{adduction}} - \\tau_{\\mathrm{primary}} $$\nSubstituting the expressions for torque:\n$$ \\Delta \\tau = (F \\times r_{\\mathrm{adduction}}) - (F \\times r_{\\mathrm{primary}}) $$\nFactoring out the constant force, $F$:\n$$ \\Delta \\tau = F \\times (r_{\\mathrm{adduction}} - r_{\\mathrm{primary}}) $$\nNow, substitute the expression for $r_{\\mathrm{adduction}}$ in terms of $r_{\\mathrm{primary}}$:\n$$ \\Delta \\tau = F \\times (0.90 \\times r_{\\mathrm{primary}} - r_{\\mathrm{primary}}) $$\n$$ \\Delta \\tau = F \\times r_{\\mathrm{primary}} \\times (0.90 - 1) $$\n$$ \\Delta \\tau = -0.10 \\times F \\times r_{\\mathrm{primary}} $$\nThis derived expression gives the change in torque in terms of the given parameters.

We must convert the moment arm from millimeters to meters.\n$$ 1\\,\\mathrm{mm} = 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{m} $$\nSo,\n$$ r_{\\mathrm{primary}} = 11 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{m} $$\nSubstituting the numerical values into the expression for $\\Delta \\tau$:\n$$ \\Delta \\tau = -0.10 \\times (1.5\\,\\mathrm{N}) \\times (11 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{m}) $$\n$$ \\Delta \\tau = -0.15 \\times 11 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{N\\cdot m} $$\n$$ \\Delta \\tau = -1.65 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{N\\cdot m} $$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures. The calculated value $-1.65 \\times 10^{-3}$ has three significant figures. To express it with four, we add a trailing zero.\n$$ \\Delta \\tau = -1.650 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{N\\cdot m} $$\nThis represents the change in torque when the eye moves from primary gaze to $25^{\\circ}$ adduction under the specified conditions.",

            "introduction": "To generate a rapid saccadic eye movement, the brain must issue a precise neural command that overcomes the viscous drag of the orbital tissues. This is achieved through a 'pulse-step' pattern of innervation, where the duration of the initial high-frequency 'pulse' dictates the amplitude of the saccade. This practice  allows you to apply an empirical model that links saccade amplitude to its duration, providing insight into the fundamental temporal coding used by the brainstem's saccade generator.",

            "problem": "A saccade is a rapid, conjugate eye movement generated by the brainstem oculomotor burst neurons to redirect the line of sight. The ocular motor plant can be approximated as a viscous-elastic system, where the torque required to move the eye of position $\\theta(t)$ obeys $M(t)=B\\,\\dot{\\theta}(t)+K\\,\\theta(t)$ with viscosity $B$ and stiffness $K$. To surmount plant viscosity and produce a fast displacement, the premotor system utilizes a phasic \"pulse\" of innervation whose width equals the saccade duration, followed by a tonic \"step\" to hold the new position.

For any saccade,\n$$\nA=\\int_{0}^{T} v(t)\\,dt,\n$$\nwhere $T$ is the saccade duration (equivalently, the neural pulse width).

            "solution": "The problem is deemed valid as it is scientifically grounded in established principles of ocular motility, well-posed with sufficient information, and objective in its formulation.\n\nThe problem is addressed in two parts as requested.\n\nPart 1: Calculation of Saccade Duration $T(A)$\n\nThe problem provides an empirical linear model for the duration of a saccade, $T$, as a function of its amplitude, $A$:\n$$\nT(A) = T_0 + kA\n$$\nThe given parameters are a baseline duration $T_0 = 20\\,\\mathrm{ms}$ and a scaling factor $k = 2.2\\,\\mathrm{ms/deg}$. We are asked to compute the duration for three different saccade amplitudes.\n\nFor a saccade amplitude of $A = 5^{\\circ}$:\n$$\nT(5) = 20 + (2.2)(5) = 20 + 11 = 31\n$$\nThe duration is $31\\,\\mathrm{ms}$.\n\nFor a saccade amplitude of $A = 10^{\\circ}$:\n$$\nT(10) = 20 + (2.2)(10) = 20 + 22 = 42\n$$\nThe duration is $42\\,\\mathrm{ms}$.\n\nFor a saccade amplitude of $A = 30^{\\circ}$:\n$$\nT(30) = 20 + (2.2)(30) = 20 + 66 = 86\n$$\nThe duration is $86\\,\\mathrm{ms}$.\n\nPart 2: Explanation of Neural Pulse Width Scaling\n\nThe relationship between saccade amplitude $A$, duration $T$, and angular velocity $v(t)$ is given by the integral:\n$$\nA = \\int_{0}^{T} v(t)\\,dt\n$$\nThis equation states that the amplitude (total change in position) is the time integral of the velocity over the saccade duration.\n\nThe problem specifies a regime where the peak firing rate of burst neurons approaches a ceiling and the velocity profile shape remains similar across amplitudes. This can be formalized by expressing the velocity profile as $v(t) = v_{peak} \\cdot f(t/T)$, where $v_{peak}$ is the characteristic peak velocity (assumed to be constant in this regime) and $f(\\tau)$ is a normalized, dimensionless function describing the shape of the velocity profile over the normalized time $\\tau = t/T$. The function $f(\\tau)$ is non-zero for $\\tau \\in [0, 1]$.\n\nSubstituting this form of $v(t)$ into the amplitude integral:\n$$\nA = \\int_{0}^{T} v_{peak} f\\left(\\frac{t}{T}\\right) \\,dt\n$$\nWe perform a change of variables with $\\tau = t/T$, which implies $dt = T\\,d\\tau$. The limits of integration change from $t=0$ and $t=T$ to $\\tau=0$ and $\\tau=1$:\n$$\nA = \\int_{0}^{1} v_{peak} f(\\tau) (T\\,d\\tau) = v_{peak} T \\int_{0}^{1} f(\\tau) \\,d\\tau\n$$\nThe term $\\int_{0}^{1} f(\\tau) \\,d\\tau$ is a dimensionless constant that depends only on the shape of the velocity profile. Let us denote this constant by $C_{shape}$. The equation becomes:\n$$\nA = v_{peak} \\cdot C_{shape} \\cdot T\n$$\nSince $v_{peak}$ and $C_{shape}$ are assumed to be constant for the saccades under consideration, this equation shows that the amplitude $A$ is directly proportional to the duration $T$, i.e., $A \\propto T$.\n\nThe problem states that the neural innervation for a saccade consists of a phasic \"pulse\" whose width, let's call it $w$, is equal to the saccade duration $T$. That is, $w(A) = T(A)$.\nTherefore, the neural pulse width $w$ must also be proportional to the amplitude $A$. This explains why the pulse width must be modulated to control saccade amplitude: to move the eye a larger distance under the constraint of a fixed-peak-velocity motor command, the command must be applied for a longer time.\n\nThe provided empirical model, $T(A) = T_0+k\\,A$, refines the simple proportionality. The term $kA$ represents the linear scaling between amplitude and duration that we derived. The term $T_0$ represents a baseline duration that is independent of amplitude, accounting for fixed latencies in the oculomotor system such as neural conduction delays and the time required for muscle force to build.\n\nGiven that the neural pulse width $w(A)$ is defined to be equal to the saccade duration $T(A)$, the analytical scaling relationship for the pulse width as a function of $A$, $T_0$, and $k$ must be identical to the relationship for the duration.\n$$\nw(A) = T(A) = T_0 + kA\n$$\nThis is the required analytical scaling relationship for the pulse width.\n\nThe final answer requires the three computed durations and this symbolic expression.",
