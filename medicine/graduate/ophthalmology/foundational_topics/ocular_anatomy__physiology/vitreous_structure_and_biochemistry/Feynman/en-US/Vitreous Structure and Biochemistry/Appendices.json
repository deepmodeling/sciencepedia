The concept of a refractive index increment, $\\frac{dn}{dc}$, is a standard, well-established parameter in the physical chemistry of polymer and biopolymer solutions. The values provided for the refractive index of water, solute concentration in the vitreous, and the refractive index increment are all physically realistic and consistent with experimental data found in biophysical literature.\n-   **Well-Posedness:** The problem is well-posed.

A solution will now be derived.\n\n### Solution Derivation\nThe refractive index, $n$, of a solution is a function of the solute concentration, $c$. This relationship can be expressed as $n(c)$. The problem states to use the definition of the refractive index increment, which is the derivative of $n$ with respect to $c$:\n$$\n\\frac{dn}{dc} = \\frac{d}{dc} n(c)\n$$\nThe problem also specifies the assumption of \"linear response for small concentration changes.\" This allows us to approximate the function $n(c)$ using a first-order Taylor expansion around the concentration of the pure solvent, i.e., $c=0$.\n$$\nn(c) \\approx n(0) + \\left. \\frac{dn}{dc} \\right|_{c=0} \\cdot (c - 0)\n$$\nUnder the assumption of linearity in the dilute regime, this approximation becomes an equality.\nThe term $n(0)$ is the refractive index at zero solute concentration, which is the refractive index of the pure solvent, given as $n_0$. The term $\\left. \\frac{dn}{dc} \\right|_{c=0}$ is the refractive index increment in the limit of zero concentration. For a dilute solution, this is taken to be constant and is given the value $\\frac{dn}{dc}$. Thus, the governing equation is:\n$$\nn = n_0 + \\left(\\frac{dn}{dc}\\right) c\n$$\nWe are given the following values:\n-   $n_0 = 1.3330$\n-   $\\frac{dn}{dc} = 0.18\\ \\text{mL/g}$\n-   $c = 0.01\\ \\text{g/mL}$\n\nSubstituting these values into the equation:\n$$\nn = 1.3330 + \\left(0.18\\ \\frac{\\text{mL}}{\\text{g}}\\right) \\left(0.01\\ \\frac{\\text{g}}{\\text{mL}}\\right)\n$$\nFirst, we compute the product term, which represents the contribution of the solutes to the refractive index. The units $(\\text{mL/g}) \\cdot (\\text{g/mL})$ cancel out, leaving a dimensionless quantity, as expected.\n$$\n\\left(0.18\\right) \\cdot \\left(0.01\\right) = 0.0018\n$$\nNow, we add this contribution to the baseline refractive index of the solvent:\n$$\nn = 1.3330 + 0.0018 = 1.3348\n$$\nThe problem requires the final answer to be rounded to four significant figures. The calculated value is $n = 1.3348$. The first four significant figures are $1$, $3$, $3$, and $4$. The fifth significant figure is $8$. Since $8 \\ge 5$, we round up the fourth significant figure.\n$$\nn \\approx 1.335\n$$\nThis is the final estimated refractive index of the vitreous humor under the given conditions.",

A collagen fibril segment is modeled as a straight circular cylinder with diameter $d$ and length $\\ell$. The volume of a single such cylindrical segment, $V_{\\text{seg}}$, is given by the formula for the volume of a cylinder:\n$$V_{\\text{seg}} = (\\text{Area of circular base}) \\times (\\text{Length})$$\nThe radius of the base is $r = \\frac{d}{2}$.

The calculated volume fraction $\\phi \\approx 3.53 \\times 10^{-10}$ is an exceptionally small number. This indicates that the vitreous gel is an extremely sparse network, where the collagen fibrils—the primary scatterers of light—occupy a minuscule fraction of the total volume. The overwhelming majority of the medium is water and hyaluronan.\n\nMacroscopic transparency is a direct consequence of minimal light scattering and absorption. The calculated value of $\\phi$ explains this low scattering as follows:\n$1$. The problem states that attenuation in a dilute medium scales linearly with the number density of scatterers. More fundamentally, the total scattering effect is a function of both the number of scatterers and their individual scattering strength (cross-section). The extremely low volume fraction $\\phi$ signifies that the density of scattering *material* is very low. Consequently, a photon traversing the vitreous has a very low probability of interacting with a collagen fibril.\n$2$. The physical parameters place the scattering in a regime of very low efficiency. The fibril diameter $d = 15\\,\\text{nm}$ is much smaller than the wavelengths of visible light ($\\lambda \\approx 550\\,\\text{nm}$). As stated, scattering in this Rayleigh regime (where the scatterer size is much less than $\\lambda$) is very weak, with a strength that decreases steeply with the size of the scatterer.\nIn summary, the macroscopic transparency of the vitreous gel is supported by the combination of two factors which are encapsulated by the small value of $\\phi$: the extreme sparseness of the collagen network (a very small amount of scattering material per unit volume) and the very low scattering efficiency of the individual, nano-scale fibrils. The net result is that light passes through the medium with negligible attenuation due to scattering.",
