This barrier function is histologically rooted in the tight junctions, or zonula occludens, which seal the space between the most superficial epithelial cells. This exercise translates that anatomical structure into a measurable biophysical parameter, the transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER), which quantifies the barrier's effectiveness against ion flow. By deriving the resistance from fundamental electrical principles, you will bridge the gap between microscopic structure and macroscopic physiological function .",

            "problem": "A corneal epithelial sheet, composed of basal, wing, and superficial cell layers, forms a barrier through apical tight junctions (zonula occludens, ZO) in the superficial cells that restrict paracellular ion movement. The total transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER) arises from two concurrent pathways: a paracellular route dominated by tight junctions and a transcellular route through cell membranes and cytoplasm. In area-normalized measurements, the paracellular pathway has resistance $R_{p}$ and the transcellular pathway has resistance $R_{t}$. Consider a steady-state condition under a small applied transepithelial potential difference such that linear current-voltage behavior holds and the sheet behaves as a passive, time-invariant system.\n\nStarting from Ohm’s law and conservation of current across parallel pathways, derive the expression for the equivalent transepithelial resistance $R_{T}$ of the epithelial sheet without assuming any prefabricated network formulas, and then compute $R_{T}$ for $R_{p} = 2000\\,\\Omega\\cdot\\text{cm}^{2}$ and $R_{t} = 10000\\,\\Omega\\cdot\\text{cm}^{2}$.

            "solution": "The problem is valid as it is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. It provides a standard biophysical model of an epithelial sheet and requires a derivation from first principles followed by a calculation. All necessary data are provided, and the context is consistent with established principles in cell physiology and biophysics.\n\nWe are tasked with deriving the expression for the total transepithelial electrical resistance, $R_T$, of the corneal epithelium. The epithelium is modeled as two concurrent electrical pathways: a paracellular route with resistance $R_p$ and a transcellular route with resistance $R_t$. The term \"concurrent pathways\" implies they are in parallel. This means that the transepithelial potential difference, let's call it $\\Delta V$, applied across the entire sheet is the same as the potential difference across each individual pathway.\n\nThe derivation must start from fundamental principles: Ohm's law and the conservation of current.\n\nLet $I_p$ be the current flowing through the paracellular pathway and $I_t$ be the current flowing through the transcellular pathway. According to Ohm's law, the current through each pathway is given by the potential difference across it divided by its resistance. Since the potential difference $\\Delta V$ is the same for both pathways, we can write:\n$$\nI_p = \\frac{\\Delta V}{R_p}\n$$\nand\n$$\nI_t = \\frac{\\Delta V}{R_t}\n$$\nThe problem is set in a steady-state condition where current is conserved. This is an application of Kirchhoff's Current Law to the node where the total current splits into the two pathways. The total current, $I_T$, flowing through the epithelial sheet must be the sum of the currents flowing through the individual parallel pathways:\n$$\nI_T = I_p + I_t\n$$\nNow, we substitute the expressions for $I_p$ and $I_t$ from Ohm's law into the current conservation equation:\n$$\nI_T = \\frac{\\Delta V}{R_p} + \\frac{\\Delta V}{R_t}\n$$\nWe can factor out the common term $\\Delta V$:\n$$\nI_T = \\Delta V \\left( \\frac{1}{R_p} + \\frac{1}{R_t} \\right)\n$$\nThe equivalent or total transepithelial resistance, $R_T$, is defined by applying Ohm's law to the entire system. It relates the total current $I_T$ to the total potential difference $\\Delta V$:\n$$\n\\Delta V = I_T R_T\n$$\nThis can be rearranged to express $I_T$ as:\n$$\nI_T = \\frac{\\Delta V}{R_T}\n$$\nWe now have two expressions for the total current $I_T$. Equating them yields:\n$$\n\\frac{\\Delta V}{R_T} = \\Delta V \\left( \\frac{1}{R_p} + \\frac{1}{R_t} \\right)\n$$\nSince a small potential difference is applied, $\\Delta V$ is non-zero, and we can divide both sides of the equation by $\\Delta V$:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{R_T} = \\frac{1}{R_p} + \\frac{1}{R_t}\n$$\nThis equation shows that the reciprocal of the total resistance is the sum of the reciprocals of the individual parallel resistances. To solve for $R_T$, we first find a common denominator for the right-hand side:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{R_T} = \\frac{R_t}{R_p R_t} + \\frac{R_p}{R_p R_t} = \\frac{R_p + R_t}{R_p R_t}\n$$\nFinally, taking the reciprocal of both sides gives the desired expression for the equivalent transepithelial resistance $R_T$:\n$$\nR_T = \\frac{R_p R_t}{R_p + R_t}\n$$\nThis completes the derivation from first principles.\n\nThe second part of the problem is to compute the numerical value of $R_T$ given the values $R_p = 2000\\,\\Omega\\cdot\\text{cm}^{2}$ and $R_t = 10000\\,\\Omega\\cdot\\text{cm}^{2}$. We substitute these values into the derived formula. Note that the units are $\\Omega\\cdot\\text{cm}^{2}$, which are area-normalized resistance units, and will be preserved throughout the calculation.\n$$\nR_T = \\frac{(2000)(10000)}{2000 + 10000}\n$$\nThe numerator is:\n$$\n2000 \\times 10000 = 2 \\times 10^3 \\times 1 \\times 10^4 = 2 \\times 10^7\n$$\nThe denominator is:\n$$\n2000 + 10000 = 12000 = 1.2 \\times 10^4\n$$\nSo, $R_T$ is:\n$$\nR_T = \\frac{2 \\times 10^7}{1.2 \\times 10^4} = \\frac{20000000}{12000} = \\frac{20000}{12}\n$$\nSimplifying the fraction:\n$$\nR_T = \\frac{5000}{3}\n$$\nAs a decimal, this is $1666.666... \\,\\Omega\\cdot\\text{cm}^{2}$. The problem requires the final answer to be rounded to four significant figures. The first four digits are $1$, $6$, $6$, $6$. The fifth digit is $6$, which is greater than or equal to $5$, so we round up the fourth digit.\n$$\nR_T \\approx 1667\\,\\Omega\\cdot\\text{cm}^{2}\n$$\nThe calculated value for the total transepithelial resistance is $1667\\,\\Omega\\cdot\\text{cm}^{2}$. As expected, the equivalent resistance of parallel resistors is less than the smallest individual resistance ($1667  2000$).",
