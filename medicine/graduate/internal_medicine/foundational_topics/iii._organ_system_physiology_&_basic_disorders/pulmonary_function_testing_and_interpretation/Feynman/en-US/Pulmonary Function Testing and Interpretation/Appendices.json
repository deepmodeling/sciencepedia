            "problem": "A $45$-year-old adult undergoes spirometry in a laboratory using standardized equipment with volumes corrected to body temperature and pressure saturated (BTPS). Three acceptable forced expiratory maneuvers are recorded with the following measured values:\n- Forced expiratory volume in one second ($FEV_1$): $2.30$ L, $2.42$ L, $2.36$ L.\n- Forced vital capacity ($FVC$): $3.60$ L, $3.72$ L, $3.64$ L.\n\nUse only the following foundational definitions and widely accepted standards:\n- $FEV_1$ is the volume of air exhaled during the first second of a forced expiratory maneuver.\n- $FVC$ is the total volume of air forcibly exhaled after full inspiration.\n- The American Thoracic Society/European Respiratory Society (ATS/ERS) repeatability criterion for adult spirometry requires that, for each parameter ($FEV_1$ and $FVC$ separately), the absolute difference between the two largest values be within $150$ mL (i.e., within $0.150$ L).\n- The reported (best) $FEV_1$ and $FVC$ are the largest observed values from acceptable maneuvers and need not originate from the same maneuver.\n\nFirst, determine whether the repeatability criterion is met for both $FEV_1$ and $FVC$. If and only if both meet repeatability, select the best $FEV_1$ and best $FVC$ according to the stated standard. Then compute the reported $FEV_1/FVC$ ratio from these best values and express it as a unitless decimal. Round your final answer to four significant figures and provide it without any units.",

It is based on established clinical guidelines from the American Thoracic Society/European Respiratory Society (ATS/ERS) for pulmonary function testing. The data provided are physiologically plausible and self-contained. The definitions and instructions are clear and unambiguous, leading to a single, verifiable solution. The problem does not violate any of the specified invalidity criteria.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is deemed valid. A solution will be derived.\n\nThe solution proceeds in three stages: ($1$) checking the repeatability criteria for both $FEV_1$ and $FVC$, ($2$) selecting the best values for $FEV_1$ and $FVC$, and ($3$) calculating the final $FEV_1/FVC$ ratio.\n\nFirst, we evaluate the repeatability of the $FEV_1$ measurements. The three recorded values are $2.30 \\text{ L}$, $2.42 \\text{ L}$, and $2.36 \\text{ L}$. To apply the ATS/ERS criterion, we identify the two largest values from this set.\nLet the ordered set of $FEV_1$ values be $S_{FEV_1} = \\{2.30, 2.36, 2.42\\}$.\nThe two largest values are $V_{FEV_1,\\text{max1}} = 2.42 \\text{ L}$ and $V_{FEV_1,\\text{max2}} = 2.36 \\text{ L}$.\nThe absolute difference, $\\Delta V_{FEV_1}$, between these two values is:\n$$\\Delta V_{FEV_1} = |V_{FEV_1,\\text{max1}} - V_{FEV_1,\\text{max2}}| = |2.42 - 2.36| = 0.06 \\text{ L}$$\nThe repeatability criterion requires this difference to be no more than $0.150 \\text{ L}$. The comparison is:\n$$0.06 \\text{ L} \\le 0.150 \\text{ L}$$\nThis inequality is true. Thus, the $FEV_1$ measurements meet the repeatability criterion.\n\nSecond, we evaluate the repeatability of the $FVC$ measurements. The three recorded values are $3.60 \\text{ L}$, $3.72 \\text{ L}$, and $3.64 \\text{ L}$.\nLet the ordered set of $FVC$ values be $S_{FVC} = \\{3.60, 3.64, 3.72\\}$.\nThe two largest values are $V_{FVC,\\text{max1}} = 3.72 \\text{ L}$ and $V_{FVC,\\text{max2}} = 3.64 \\text{ L}$.\nThe absolute difference, $\\Delta V_{FVC}$, between these two values is:\n$$\\Delta V_{FVC} = |V_{FVC,\\text{max1}} - V_{FVC,\\text{max2}}| = |3.72 - 3.64| = 0.08 \\text{ L}$$\nThe repeatability criterion requires this difference to be no more than $0.150 \\text{ L}$. The comparison is:\n$$0.08 \\text{ L} \\le 0.150 \\text{ L}$$\nThis inequality is also true. Thus, the $FVC$ measurements meet the repeatability criterion.\n\nSince both $FEV_1$ and $FVC$ measurements meet their respective repeatability criteria, we proceed to determine the reported values. According to the stated standard, the reported (best) value for each parameter is the largest observed value from the set of acceptable maneuvers.\n\nFor $FEV_1$, the largest value, which we denote $V_{FEV_1,\\text{best}}$, is:\n$$V_{FEV_1,\\text{best}} = \\max(\\{2.30, 2.42, 2.36\\}) = 2.42 \\text{ L}$$\nFor $FVC$, the largest value, which we denote $V_{FVC,\\text{best}}$, is:\n$$V_{FVC,\\text{best}} = \\max(\\{3.60, 3.72, 3.64\\}) = 3.72 \\text{ L}$$\n\nFinally, we compute the reported $FEV_1/FVC$ ratio, denoted as $R$, using these best values. The problem specifies that this ratio is unitless.\n$$R = \\frac{V_{FEV_1,\\text{best}}}{V_{FVC,\\text{best}}} = \\frac{2.42}{3.72}$$\nPerforming the division gives:\n$$R \\approx 0.6505376344...$$\nThe problem requires the final answer to be rounded to four significant figures. The first four significant figures are $6$, $5$, $0$, and $5$. The fifth significant figure is $3$. Since $3 < 5$, we round by truncating after the fourth significant figure.\n$$R_{\\text{rounded}} = 0.6505$$\nThis is the final reported $FEV_1/FVC$ ratio.",

It does not violate any fundamental principles, is not based on false premises, and contains no ambiguities.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is deemed **valid**. A full solution will be provided.\n\nThe solution proceeds by addressing the tasks set forth in the problem statement.\n\nFirst, we compute the percent predicted values for FEV1 and FVC. The percent predicted is defined as the ratio of the measured value to the predicted value.\n\nThe $FEV_1$ percent predicted, denoted as $\\text{FEV1}_{\\%\\text{pred}}$, is:\n$$ \\text{FEV1}_{\\%\\text{pred}} = \\frac{\\text{FEV1}_{\\text{meas}}}{\\text{FEV1}_{\\text{pred}}} = \\frac{1.8}{3.0} = 0.60 $$\nThis corresponds to $60\\%$ of the predicted value.\n\nThe $FVC$ percent predicted, denoted as $\\text{FVC}_{\\%\\text{pred}}$, is:\n$$ \\text{FVC}_{\\%\\text{pred}} = \\frac{\\text{FVC}_{\\text{meas}}}{\\text{FVC}_{\\text{pred}}} = \\frac{3.4}{4.0} = 0.85 $$\nThis corresponds to $85\\%$ of the predicted value.\n\nSecond, we compute the $FEV_1/FVC$ ratio using the measured values, as per its definition.\n$$ \\frac{\\text{FEV1}_{\\text{meas}}}{\\text{FVC}_{\\text{meas}}} = \\frac{1.8}{3.4} \\approx 0.52941176... $$\n\nThird, we classify the ventilatory pattern. The standard algorithm for spirometry interpretation involves a stepwise assessment.\n1.  **Assess for an obstructive pattern:** An obstructive defect is defined by a reduced $FEV_1/FVC$ ratio. The criterion is whether the measured ratio is below the Lower Limit of Normal (LLN) for the patient's demographic.\n    - Measured $FEV_1/FVC$ ratio $\\approx 0.5294$.\n    - LLN for $FEV_1/FVC$ ratio = $0.67$.\n    - Since $0.5294 < 0.67$, an obstructive pattern is present.\n\n2.  **Assess for a restrictive pattern:** A restrictive pattern is suggested by a reduced Forced Vital Capacity ($FVC$). The standard threshold for this is an FVC below $80\\%$ of the predicted value (or below the FVC LLN, if available).\n    - $FVC$ percent predicted = $0.85$, or $85\\%$.\n    - Since $85\\% \\ge 80\\%$, the $FVC$ is within the normal range. Therefore, there is no evidence of a restrictive pattern from spirometry. (A definitive diagnosis of restriction would require measurement of Total Lung Capacity, TLC, via plethysmography, but based on spirometry alone, restriction is not present).\n\n3.  **Synthesize the findings:** The patient has an $FEV_1/FVC$ ratio below the LLN (indicating obstruction) and a normal $FVC$ percent predicted (no evidence of restriction). Therefore, the ventilatory pattern is classified as **obstructive**.\n\nFourth, we determine the severity of the obstructive defect. According to the American Thoracic Society (ATS) and European Respiratory Society (ERS) guidelines, the severity of an obstructive defect is graded based on the $FEV_1$ percent predicted.\n- $FEV_1$ percent predicted = $0.60$, or $60\\%$.\n- The standard severity classification for obstructive disease is as follows:\n  - Mild: $\\text{FEV1}_{\\%\\text{pred}} \\ge 70\\%$\n  - Moderate: $60\\% \\le \\text{FEV1}_{\\%\\text{pred}} < 70\\%$\n  - Moderately Severe: $50\\% \\le \\text{FEV1}_{\\%\\text{pred}} < 60\\%$\n  - Severe: $35\\% \\le \\text{FEV1}_{\\%\\text{pred}} < 50\\%$\n  - Very Severe: $\\text{FEV1}_{\\%\\text{pred}} < 35\\%$\nBased on this scheme, an $\\text{FEV1}_{\\%\\text{pred}}$ of $60\\%$ falls into the **Moderate** severity category.\n\nFinally, we report the $FEV_1/FVC$ ratio rounded to four significant figures as requested for the final answer.\n$$ \\frac{1.8}{3.4} \\approx 0.5294 $$",

Round your final z-score to four significant figures. Express the z-score as a unitless number.",
            "solution": "The problem requires the calculation of a standard score (z-score) for a measured Forced Expiratory Volume in one second ($FEV_1$) and a determination of whether this value falls below the Lower Limit of Normal (LLN). The solution will be derived from first principles of Gaussian statistics.\n\nA z-score is a measure of how many standard deviations an observed value is from the mean of its distribution. For a random variable $X$ that follows a Gaussian (normal) distribution with mean $\\mu$ and standard deviation $\\sigma$, denoted as $X \\sim N(\\mu, \\sigma^2)$, its corresponding z-score $Z$ is calculated by the standardization formula:\n$$Z = \\frac{X - \\mu}{\\sigma}$$\nThe resulting variable $Z$ follows the standard normal distribution, $Z \\sim N(0, 1)$, which has a mean of $0$ and a standard deviation of $1$.\n\nIn this problem, the measured $FEV_1$ for a subject is considered a random variable. The problem states that the model residuals are Gaussian. This implies that the distribution of possible measured $FEV_1$ values for a given subject is itself Gaussian, with a mean equal to the predicted value, $\\hat{\\mu}$, and a standard deviation equal to the residual standard deviation of the reference equation, $\\sigma$.\nWe are given the following values:\n- The measured $FEV_1$, which we denote as $x_{\\text{meas}}$: $x_{\\text{meas}} = 2.8 \\, \\mathrm{L}$.\n- The predicted mean $FEV_1$, $\\hat{\\mu}$: $\\hat{\\mu} = 3.2 \\, \\mathrm{L}$.\n- The residual standard deviation, $\\sigma$: $\\sigma = 0.4 \\, \\mathrm{L}$.\n\nWe apply the z-score formula to these values to find the standard score for the patient's measurement:\n$$z = \\frac{x_{\\text{meas}} - \\hat{\\mu}}{\\sigma}$$\nSubstituting the given numerical values:\n$$z = \\frac{2.8 - 3.2}{0.4} = \\frac{-0.4}{0.4} = -1.0$$\nThe z-score for the patient's measured $FEV_1$ is exactly $-1.0$.\n\nNext, we must determine if this value falls below the LLN. The problem defines the LLN as the $0.05$ quantile (or $5^{th}$ percentile) of the reference distribution. For a one-sided test for low values, a measurement is considered below the LLN if its value is in the lowest $5\\%$ of the reference distribution. In terms of z-scores, this means we must find the z-score, which we denote $z_{LLN}$, that corresponds to the $0.05$ quantile of the standard normal distribution. This is the value $z_{LLN}$ such that the area under the standard normal probability density curve to its left is $0.05$. If $\\Phi(z)$ is the cumulative distribution function (CDF) for the standard normal distribution, then $z_{LLN}$ is defined by:\n$$\\Phi(z_{LLN}) = P(Z \\leq z_{LLN}) = 0.05$$\nFrom standard statistical tables or computation, the value for the $0.05$ quantile of the standard normal distribution is approximately:\n$$z_{LLN} \\approx -1.645$$\n\nA measured value is classified as being below the LLN if its calculated z-score is less than $z_{LLN}$. We must compare the patient's z-score, $z = -1.0$, to $z_{LLN} \\approx -1.645$.\nThe comparison is:\n$$-1.0 > -1.645$$\nSince the calculated z-score of $-1.0$ is greater than the critical value for the LLN, the patient's measured $FEV_1$ of $2.8 \\, \\mathrm{L}$ does not fall below the Lower Limit of Normal.\n\nThe problem requests that only the z-score be reported as the final answer, rounded to four significant figures. The calculated z-score is $-1.0$. To express this value with four significant figures, we write it as $-1.000$.",
