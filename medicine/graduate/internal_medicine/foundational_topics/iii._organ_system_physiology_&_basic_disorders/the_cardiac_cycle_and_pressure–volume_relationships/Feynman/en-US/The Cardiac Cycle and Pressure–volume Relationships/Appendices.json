It is scientifically grounded in the principles of cardiovascular physiology and classical mechanics, well-posed with sufficient and consistent data, and objectively formulated. All provided values and conversion factors are standard and physically realistic. The problem requires the application of fundamental definitions to compute physiological quantities, which is a standard scientific task.\n\nThe first step is to compute the stroke volume ($SV$). Stroke volume is defined as the volume of blood ejected from the left ventricle during one contraction (systole). It is the difference between the end-diastolic volume ($EDV$), the volume of blood in the ventricle at the end of filling, and the end-systolic volume ($ESV$), the volume of blood remaining in the ventricle at the end of ejection.\n\nThe given values are:\nEnd-diastolic volume, $EDV = 140$ mL.\nEnd-systolic volume, $ESV = 70$ mL.\n\nThe formula for stroke volume is:\n$$SV = EDV - ESV$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$SV = 140 \\, \\text{mL} - 70 \\, \\text{mL} = 70 \\, \\text{mL}$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures. Therefore, the stroke volume is expressed as $70.00$ mL.\n\nThe second step is to estimate the external stroke work ($SW$) for one cardiac cycle. The problem states that external mechanical work is the area enclosed by the pressure–volume loop, which is given by the cyclic integral $SW = \\oint P \\, dV$. It further specifies using a clinically accepted rectangular approximation, where the work is estimated as the product of the mean ejection pressure ($P_{m,ej}$) and the stroke volume ($SV$).\n\nThe formula for the estimated stroke work is:\n$$SW \\approx P_{m,ej} \\times SV$$\n\nThe given mean ejection pressure is $P_{m,ej} = 110$ mmHg. The calculated stroke volume is $SV = 70$ mL. To calculate the work in Joules ($J$), the pressure must be in Pascals ($Pa$) and the volume in cubic meters ($m^3$), as $1 \\, \\text{J} = 1 \\, \\text{Pa} \\cdot \\text{m}^3$.\n\nWe use the provided conversion factors:\n$1$ mmHg = $133.322$ Pa\n$1$ mL = $1 \\times 10^{-6}$ m$^{3}$\n\nFirst, convert the pressure from mmHg to Pa:\n$$P_{m,ej} = 110 \\, \\text{mmHg} \\times \\frac{133.322 \\, \\text{Pa}}{1 \\, \\text{mmHg}} = 14665.42 \\, \\text{Pa}$$\n\nNext, convert the stroke volume from mL to m$^{3}$:\n$$SV = 70 \\, \\text{mL} \\times \\frac{1 \\times 10^{-6} \\, \\text{m}^3}{1 \\, \\text{mL}} = 70 \\times 10^{-6} \\, \\text{m}^3$$\n\nNow, calculate the stroke work in Joules:\n$$SW = (14665.42 \\, \\text{Pa}) \\times (70 \\times 10^{-6} \\, \\text{m}^3)$$\n$$SW = 1.0265794 \\, \\text{J}$$\n\nThe problem requires rounding the result to four significant figures.

The beat-to-beat pressure–volume loop reveals an end-systolic pressure of $P_{es} = 120$ mmHg and a stroke volume of $SV = 60$ mL.

Using only first principles of pressure–volume relations and the core definitions of total arterial load and end-systolic elastance, determine the effective arterial elastance $E_{a}$ from the given beat and then the dimensionless ventricular–arterial coupling ratio $E_{a}/E_{es}$.

The total arterial load faced by the ventricle over a beat can be compactly captured by an effective elastance, termed effective arterial elastance, which by definition reflects the net afterload integrating peripheral resistance, arterial compliance, characteristic impedance, and heart period. From pressure–volume first principles, the effective arterial elastance $E_{a}$ is obtained by the ratio of end-systolic pressure to the stroke volume ejected on that beat, because $E_{a}$ represents the slope of the arterial load line relating pressure to the volume displaced into the arterial system per beat.

            "problem": "A patient with longstanding hypertension undergoes acute vasoconstriction during an isometric handgrip. Assume the left ventricle is operating on a stable end-systolic pressure–volume relationship (ESPVR), defined as a linear relation between end-systolic pressure and volume, with slope equal to the end-systolic elastance $E_{es}$ and volume-axis intercept $V_0$. The effective arterial elastance (Ea) is defined as $E_a$, the ratio of end-systolic pressure to stroke volume, and can be represented as a linear arterial load line that characterizes afterload during ejection. Ejection fraction (EF) is defined as $\\mathrm{EF} = \\dfrac{SV}{EDV} = \\dfrac{V_{ED} - V_{ES}}{V_{ED}}$, where $SV$ is stroke volume, $EDV$ is end-diastolic volume, and $ESV$ is end-systolic volume. End-systolic pressure equals aortic pressure at aortic valve closure.\n\nUsing only these definitions as a starting point and the geometric construction that the end-systolic point is the intersection of the ventricular ESPVR and the arterial load line, reason from first principles whether $\\mathrm{EF}$ can fall when afterload acutely increases even if intrinsic contractility ($E_{es}$) is unchanged, and identify the correct symbolic dependence of $V_{ES}$ on $E_a$, $E_{es}$, $V_{ED}$, and $V_0$ implied by that intersection.\n\nFor a concrete, scientifically plausible setting, consider $V_0 = 10~\\mathrm{mL}$, $V_{ED} = 120~\\mathrm{mL}$, and $E_{es} = 2.0~\\mathrm{mmHg}/\\mathrm{mL}$, with $E_a$ increasing acutely from $1.5~\\mathrm{mmHg}/\\mathrm{mL}$ to $2.5~\\mathrm{mmHg}/\\mathrm{mL}$ during the maneuver, while $E_{es}$ and $V_{ED}$ remain unchanged.\n\nWhich option best captures the first-principles explanation and the correct dependence of $V_{ES}$ on $E_a$, $E_{es}$, $V_{ED}$, and $V_0$?\n\nA. $\\mathrm{EF}$ falls with increased $E_a$ at constant $E_{es}$ because the end-systolic intersection shifts to a higher $V_{ES}$ along the ESPVR; the intersection condition implies $V_{ES} = \\dfrac{E_a V_{ED} + E_{es} V_0}{E_a + E_{es}}$, so $\\dfrac{\\partial V_{ES}}{\\partial E_a} > 0$ when $V_{ED} > V_0$.\n\nB. $\\mathrm{EF}$ is invariant to changes in $E_a$ if $E_{es}$ is unchanged because the ESPVR slope alone determines $SV$, giving $V_{ES} = \\dfrac{E_{es} V_{ED} + E_a V_0}{E_a + E_{es}}$.\n\nC.

We must also derive the symbolic expression for the end-systolic volume ($V_{ES}$).\n\n### Step 1: Problem Validation\n\nThe problem statement is based on the pressure–volume loop analysis of the cardiac cycle, a standard and scientifically sound framework in cardiovascular physiology.\n\n**Extracted Givens:**\n*   **Ventricular Model (ESPVR):** A linear relationship between end-systolic pressure ($P_{ES}$) and end-systolic volume ($V_{ES}$): $P_{ES} = E_{es}(V_{ES} - V_0)$, where $E_{es}$ is the slope (end-systolic elastance) and $V_0$ is the volume-axis intercept.\n*   **Arterial Load Model:** Effective arterial elastance is defined as $E_a = \\dfrac{P_{ES}}{SV}$, where $SV$ is the stroke volume.\n*   **Stroke Volume Definition:** $SV = V_{ED} - V_{ES}$, where $V_{ED}$ is the end-diastolic volume.\n*   **Ejection Fraction Definition:** $\\mathrm{EF} = \\dfrac{SV}{V_{ED}} = \\dfrac{V_{ED} - V_{ES}}{V_{ED}}$.\n*   **Intersection Condition:** The end-systolic state $(V_{ES}, P_{ES})$ is the intersection of the ESPVR and the arterial load line.\n*   **Scenario Conditions:** Afterload ($E_a$) increases acutely while intrinsic contractility ($E_{es}$) and preload ($V_{ED}$) remain constant.\n*   **Numerical Example:** $V_0 = 10~\\mathrm{mL}$, $V_{ED} = 120~\\mathrm{mL}$, $E_{es} = 2.0~\\mathrm{mmHg}/\\mathrm{mL}$, and $E_a$ increases from $1.5~\\mathrm{mmHg}/\\mathrm{mL}$ to $2.5~\\mathrm{mmHg}/\\mathrm{mL}$.\n\n**Validation Verdict:**\nThe problem is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. It uses a standard, albeit simplified, model of ventricular-arterial coupling. The definitions are clear and sufficient to derive a unique solution. The provided numerical values are physiologically plausible. The assumptions (constant $E_{es}$ and $V_{ED}$) are standard for isolating the effects of afterload. The problem is therefore valid.\n\n### Step 2: Derivation from First Principles\n\nWe begin by formalizing the two relationships that determine the end-systolic point $(V_{ES}, P_{ES})$.\n\n1.  **The End-Systolic Pressure–Volume Relationship (ESPVR):** This describes the behavior of the ventricle at the end of systole. As given, it is a linear function:\n    $$P_{ES} = E_{es} (V_{ES} - V_0) \\quad (*)$$\n\n2.  **The Arterial Load Line:** This describes the properties of the arterial system that the ventricle ejects against. From the definition $E_a = P_{ES}/SV$ and $SV = V_{ED} - V_{ES}$, we can express $P_{ES}$ in terms of $V_{ES}$:\n    $$E_a = \\frac{P_{ES}}{V_{ED} - V_{ES}}$$\n    Rearranging gives the equation for the arterial load line:\n    $$P_{ES} = E_a (V_{ED} - V_{ES}) \\quad (**)$$\n    This is a line in the $P-V$ plane with a slope of $-E_a$ that passes through the point $(V_{ED}, 0)$.\n\n3.  **Solving for $V_{ES}$:** The end-systolic point is the intersection of these two lines. We find it by setting the expressions for $P_{ES}$ from equations $(*)$ and $(**)$ equal to each other:\n    $$E_{es} (V_{ES} - V_0) = E_a (V_{ED} - V_{ES})$$\n    We now solve for $V_{ES}$:\n    $$E_{es} V_{ES} - E_{es} V_0 = E_a V_{ED} - E_a V_{ES}$$\n    $$E_{es} V_{ES} + E_a V_{ES} = E_a V_{ED} + E_{es} V_0$$\n    $$V_{ES} (E_{es} + E_a) = E_a V_{ED} + E_{es} V_0$$\n    $$V_{ES} = \\frac{E_a V_{ED} + E_{es} V_0}{E_a + E_{es}}$$\n    This is the symbolic dependence of $V_{ES}$ on the other parameters.\n\n4.  **Analyzing the Effect of an Increase in $E_a$:** To determine how $V_{ES}$ changes as $E_a$ changes, we take the partial derivative of $V_{ES}$ with respect to $E_a$, treating $E_{es}$, $V_{ED}$, and $V_0$ as constants. Using the quotient rule for differentiation, $\\dfrac{d}{dx}\\left(\\dfrac{u}{v}\\right) = \\dfrac{u'v - uv'}{v^2}$:\n    $$\\frac{\\partial V_{ES}}{\\partial E_a} = \\frac{(\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial E_a}(E_a V_{ED} + E_{es} V_0))(E_a + E_{es}) - (E_a V_{ED} + E_{es} V_0)(\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial E_a}(E_a + E_{es}))}{(E_a + E_{es})^2}$$\n    $$\\frac{\\partial V_{ES}}{\\partial E_a} = \\frac{(V_{ED})(E_a + E_{es}) - (E_a V_{ED} + E_{es} V_0)(1)}{(E_a + E_{es})^2}$$\n    $$\\frac{\\partial V_{ES}}{\\partial E_a} = \\frac{E_a V_{ED} + E_{es} V_{ED} - E_a V_{ED} - E_{es} V_0}{(E_a + E_{es})^2}$$\n    $$\\frac{\\partial V_{ES}}{\\partial E_a} = \\frac{E_{es} V_{ED} - E_{es} V_0}{(E_a + E_{es})^2} = \\frac{E_{es}(V_{ED} - V_0)}{(E_a + E_{es})^2}$$\n    In any physiological state, the ventricle's elastance $E_{es}$ is positive. The denominator $(E_a + E_{es})^2$ is also positive. The end-diastolic volume $V_{ED}$ must be greater than the zero-pressure volume $V_0$. Therefore, $(V_{ED} - V_0) > 0$. This means $\\dfrac{\\partial V_{ES}}{\\partial E_a} > 0$.\n    An increase in afterload ($E_a$) causes an increase in end-systolic volume ($V_{ES}$).\n\n5.  **Impact on Ejection Fraction ($\\mathrm{EF}$):** The ejection fraction is defined as $\\mathrm{EF} = 1 - \\dfrac{V_{ES}}{V_{ED}}$. Since $V_{ED}$ is held constant, an increase in $V_{ES}$ leads to an increase in the ratio $\\dfrac{V_{ES}}{V_{ED}}$, which in turn causes a decrease in $\\mathrm{EF}$.\n    Therefore, with constant contractility and preload, an acute increase in afterload causes the ejection fraction to fall. This occurs because the ventricle ejects less blood against the higher opposing pressure, leaving a larger volume behind at the end of systole.\n\n### Step 3: Evaluation of Options\n\n**A. $\\mathrm{EF}$ falls with increased $E_a$ at constant $E_{es}$ because the end-systolic intersection shifts to a higher $V_{ES}$ along the ESPVR; the intersection condition implies $V_{ES} = \\dfrac{E_a V_{ED} + E_{es} V_0}{E_a + E_{es}}$, so $\\dfrac{\\partial V_{ES}}{\\partial E_a} > 0$ when $V_{ED} > V_0$.**\nThis option presents a multi-part claim:\n1.  \"$\\mathrm{EF}$ falls with increased $E_a$ at constant $E_{es}$\": This matches our derivation.\n2.  \"...because the end-systolic intersection shifts to a higher $V_{ES}$...\": This is the correct mechanism, as shown by $\\dfrac{\\partial V_{ES}}{\\partial E_a} > 0$.\n3.  \"...$V_{ES} = \\dfrac{E_a V_{ED} + E_{es} V_0}{E_a + E_{es}}$\": This formula is identical to the one we derived.\n4.  \"...so $\\dfrac{\\partial V_{ES}}{\\partial E_a} > 0$ when $V_{ED} > V_0$\": This correctly identifies the condition for the positive derivative, which is always met physiologically.\nEvery part of this statement is correct and consistent with our first-principles analysis.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. $\\mathrm{EF}$ is invariant to changes in $E_a$ if $E_{es}$ is unchanged because the ESPVR slope alone determines $SV$, giving $V_{ES} = \\dfrac{E_{es} V_{ED} + E_a V_0}{E_a + E_{es}}$.**\n1.  \"$\\mathrm{EF}$ is invariant to changes in $E_a$\": This is false, as shown by the derivation. $\\mathrm{EF}$ decreases.\n2.  \"...because the ESPVR slope alone determines $SV$\": This reasoning is incorrect. $SV$ is determined by the intersection of the ventricular function (ESPVR) and the arterial load, not by the ventricular properties alone.\n3.  \"$V_{ES} = \\dfrac{E_{es} V_{ED} + E_a V_0}{E_a + E_{es}}$\": The formula is incorrect. It has improperly swapped the elastance terms in the numerator compared to the correct derivation ($E_a$ should be with $V_{ED}$ and $E_{es}$ with $V_0$).\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. Increased $E_a$ moves the intersection to a lower $V_{ES}$ because the arterial load line rotates clockwise about $V_0$, thereby increasing $SV$ and raising $\\mathrm{EF}$.**\n1.  \"Increased $E_a$ moves the intersection to a lower $V_{ES}$\": This is false. Our derivation showed $V_{ES}$ increases.\n2.  \"...thereby increasing $SV$ and raising $\\mathrm{EF}$\": This is consequently false. $SV$ and $\\mathrm{EF}$ both decrease.\n3.  \"...because the arterial load line rotates clockwise about $V_0$\": This geometric description is incorrect. The arterial load line, $P_{ES} = E_a(V_{ED} - V_{ES})$, pivots about the point $(V_{ED}, 0)$ on the volume axis, not about $(V_0, 0)$. An increase in $E_a$ makes its slope, $-E_a$, more negative, which corresponds to a counter-clockwise rotation about $(V_{ED}, 0)$.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. $\\mathrm{EF}$ can only fall with increased $E_a$ if preload ($V_{ED}$) simultaneously decreases; with constant $V_{ED}$ and $E_{es}$, $\\mathrm{EF}$ remains unchanged because end-systolic pressure scales proportionally to afterload.**\n1.  \"$\\mathrm{EF}$ can only fall with increased $E_a$ if preload ($V_{ED}$) simultaneously decreases\": This is false. Our derivation explicitly shows that $\\mathrm{EF}$ falls with increased $E_a$ even when $V_{ED}$ is held constant.\n2.  \"...with constant $V_{ED}$ and $E_{es}$, $\\mathrm{EF}$ remains unchanged...\": This is false and directly contradicts the analysis.\n3.  \"...because end-systolic pressure scales proportionally to afterload\": This reasoning is flawed. The relationship between $P_{ES}$ and $E_a$ is more complex and does not result in a constant $SV$ or $\\mathrm{EF}$.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**",
