It is based on the foundational Guytonian model of long-term blood pressure regulation, which is a cornerstone of cardiovascular physiology. The problem sets up a scenario to test the understanding of the difference between short-term hemodynamic adjustments and long-term control via the renal pressure-natriuresis mechanism.\n\n- **Scientific Soundness**: The relationships $MAP = CO \\times TPR$ and $CO = HR \\times SV$ are fundamental hemodynamic equations.

A complete solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution\nThe problem consists of two parts: first, calculating the patient's initial baseline mean arterial pressure ($MAP$), and second, determining the long-term steady-state change in $MAP$ after a specified chronic intervention.\n\n**Part 1: Calculation of Initial Mean Arterial Pressure**\n\nThe mean arterial pressure ($MAP$) is given by the product of cardiac output ($CO$) and total peripheral resistance ($TPR$).\n$$\nMAP = CO \\times TPR\n$$\nCardiac output is the product of heart rate ($HR$) and stroke volume ($SV$).\n$$\nCO = HR \\times SV\n$$\nWe are given:\n- $HR = 75 \\text{ beats/min}$\n- $SV = 80 \\text{ mL/beat}$\n- $TPR = 18 \\text{ mmHg} \\cdot \\text{min} \\cdot \\text{L}^{-1}$\n\nFirst, we must ensure consistent units. The stroke volume is given in milliliters ($mL$), while the total peripheral resistance is given in terms of liters ($L$). We convert $SV$ to liters.\n$$\nSV = 80 \\text{ mL/beat} = 0.080 \\text{ L/beat}\n$$\nNow, we calculate the cardiac output ($CO$).\n$$\nCO = (75 \\text{ beats/min}) \\times (0.080 \\text{ L/beat}) = 6.0 \\text{ L/min}\n$$\nWith the cardiac output calculated, we can determine the initial mean arterial pressure ($MAP_{initial}$).\n$$\nMAP_{initial} = (6.0 \\text{ L/min}) \\times (18 \\text{ mmHg} \\cdot \\text{min} \\cdot \\text{L}^{-1}) = 108 \\text{ mmHg}\n$$\nThe patient's initial mean arterial pressure is $108 \\text{ mmHg}$.\n\n**Part 2: Determination of the Long-Term Steady-State Change in Mean Arterial Pressure**\n\nThis part of the problem assesses the understanding of long-term blood pressure regulation. The crucial premises are:\n1.  \"In the long term, the circulatory system reaches a new steady state determined by renal-fluid balance.\"\n2.  \"Sodium intake and renal function are unchanged.\"\n\nThis framework describes the pressure-natriuresis mechanism, a central concept in the long-term control of arterial pressure. According to this model, the body's fluid volume, and thus blood pressure, is maintained at a steady state where the rate of fluid intake equals the rate of fluid excretion by the kidneys. The relationship between arterial pressure and renal water/salt excretion is described by the \"renal function curve\" or \"pressure-natriuresis curve.\" The long-term equilibrium point for $MAP$ is the pressure at which the renal output of salt and water precisely matches the net intake.\n\nThe problem states that both \"Sodium intake\" and \"renal function\" are unchanged. This means neither the intake rate (a constant value) nor the renal function curve (a function of pressure) has shifted. Therefore, the intersection point of the intake line and the renal function curve, which defines the long-term steady-state $MAP$, remains fixed.\n\nLet's consider the effect of the intervention: an isolated, sustained reduction of $HR$, $SV$, or $TPR$ by $20\\%$. For example, if $TPR$ is reduced, the immediate effect is a drop in $MAP$ since $MAP = CO \\times TPR$. However, this lower $MAP$ reduces renal excretion of salt and water (moving to a lower point on the fixed renal function curve). Because intake is unchanged, this leads to a net retention of fluid, an expansion of blood volume, and a consequent rise in cardiac output (via the Frank-Starling mechanism). This process continues until $MAP$ returns to the original equilibrium set point, at which renal output once again balances the fixed intake. At the new long-term steady state, $TPR$ is lower, but $CO$ is higher, such that their product, the $MAP$, is restored to its original value.\n\nThe same logic applies to an isolated reduction in $HR$ or $SV$. An initial drop in $CO$ and $MAP$ would trigger renal fluid retention, leading to an increase in blood volume that compensates for the initial perturbation and restores $MAP$ to the original set point.\n\nTherefore, despite the initial change in hemodynamics, the long-term steady-state mean arterial pressure must return to its original value, $MAP_{initial} = 108 \\text{ mmHg}$, because the fundamental determinants of long-term pressure (renal function and fluid intake) are unchanged.\n\nThe question asks for the steady-state change in mean arterial pressure from the original baseline.\n$$\n\\Delta MAP_{steady-state} = MAP_{final} - MAP_{initial}\n$$\nSince $MAP_{final} = MAP_{initial}$, the change is zero.\n$$\n\\Delta MAP_{steady-state} = 108 \\text{ mmHg} - 108 \\text{ mmHg} = 0 \\text{ mmHg}\n$$\nThe steady-state change in mean arterial pressure is $0$.",

It does not violate any of the criteria for invalidity.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem statement is valid. I will proceed with a full solution.\n\n###\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe analysis rests on fundamental hemodynamic principles. Mean Arterial Pressure ($MAP$), the time-averaged pressure in the arteries, is the key regulated variable in hypertension. It is determined by the product of Cardiac Output ($CO$, the total flow) and Total Peripheral Resistance ($TPR$, the opposition to flow), analogous to Ohm's law:\n$$MAP \\approx CO \\times TPR$$\nBoth patients have hypertension, meaning their $MAP$ is elevated. The distinct clinical pictures suggest different routes to this elevated $MAP$. Pulse Pressure ($PP$) is the difference between systolic ($SAP$) and diastolic ($DAP$) arterial pressures ($PP = SAP - DAP$). It is primarily determined by the stroke volume ($SV$, the volume of blood ejected per beat) and the compliance ($C$) of the arterial system:\n$$PP \\propto \\frac{SV}{C}$$\nA larger stroke volume or stiffer (less compliant) arteries will increase the pulse pressure.\n\n**Analysis of the High-Output Phenotype (Patient X)**\n\nPatient X is described as a young adult with hypermetabolic signs, warm extremities, and bounding peripheral pulses.\n\n1.  **Cardiac Output ($CO$):** \"Hypermetabolic signs\" imply an increased systemic oxygen demand. To meet this demand, the cardiovascular system must increase blood flow to the tissues. This is achieved by an **increased Cardiac Output ($CO$)**. $CO$ is the product of heart rate ($HR$) and stroke volume ($SV$), and both may be elevated.\n2.  **Total Peripheral Resistance ($TPR$):** \"Warm extremities\" indicate cutaneous vasodilation, a mechanism to dissipate the excess heat generated in a hypermetabolic state. If this vasodilation is systemic, reflecting an overall decrease in arteriolar tone to enhance tissue perfusion, it leads to a **decreased Total Peripheral Resistance ($TPR$)**. For $MAP$ to be elevated in the equation $MAP \\approx CO \\times TPR$, the increase in $CO$ must be proportionally greater than the decrease in $TPR$. This is the defining characteristic of high-output hypertension.\n3.  **Pulse Pressure ($PP$):** \"Bounding peripheral pulses\" is a direct clinical observation of a large or widened pulse pressure. Fundamentally, this arises from a large $SV$ being ejected into the arterial system. As $CO$ is elevated, $SV$ is typically increased. According to the relationship $PP \\propto SV/C$, a large $SV$ will cause a large pressure fluctuation during the cardiac cycle, resulting in a **widened Pulse Pressure ($PP$)**. The patient is young, so arterial compliance ($C$) is likely normal.\n\n**Profile for High-Output Phenotype:** $CO$ increased, $TPR$ decreased, $PP$ widened.\n\n**Analysis of the High-Resistance Phenotype (Patient Y)**\n\nPatient Y is an older adult with abdominal bruits and evidence of RAAS activation.\n\n1.  **Total Peripheral Resistance ($TPR$):** \"RAAS activation\" is the central pathophysiological driver here. Angiotensin II, a key component of the RAAS, is one of the body's most potent vasoconstrictors. It acts on systemic arterioles, increasing their tone and decreasing their radius. This causes a marked **increase in Total Peripheral Resistance ($TPR$)**. The abdominal bruit in an older patient with hypertension is a classic sign of renal artery stenosis, a condition that causes profound unilateral RAAS activation and serves as a model for high-resistance hypertension. The elevated $MAP$ is primarily driven by this high $TPR$.\n2.  **Cardiac Output ($CO$):** The heart must pump against the elevated afterload imposed by the high $TPR$. This increased workload can impair the heart's ability to eject blood, potentially leading to a decrease in stroke volume. Consequently, the **Cardiac Output ($CO$) is typically unchanged or even slightly decreased** in established high-resistance hypertension. It is not the primary driver of the elevated pressure.\n3.  **Pulse Pressure ($PP$):** The effect on $PP$ is multifactorial. Patient Y is an \"older adult,\" which implies that their arteries are likely stiffer (decreased compliance, $C$) than those of a younger person. Decreased $C$ would tend to widen the $PP$ ($PP \\propto SV/C$). However, the high $TPR$ increases afterload, which can reduce $SV$, tending to narrow the $PP$. Furthermore, the high resistance in peripheral vessels keeps the diastolic pressure elevated, which also tends to narrow the difference between systolic and diastolic pressures. Given that the dominant pathology is resistance and the stroke volume is not elevated (it may even be reduced), the pulse pressure is not expected to be wide or \"bounding.\" Therefore, a **narrowed or unchanged Pulse Pressure ($PP$)** is the most logical conclusion, contrasting starkly with the high-output state.\n\n**Profile for High-Resistance Phenotype:** $CO$ unchanged or slightly decreased, $TPR$ increased, $PP$ narrowed or unchanged.\n\n### Evaluation of Options\n\nNow, I will evaluate the provided options against these derived profiles.\n\n**A. High-output phenotype: $CO$ increased, $TPR$ decreased, $PP$ widened; High-resistance phenotype: $CO$ unchanged or slightly decreased, $TPR$ increased, $PP$ narrowed or unchanged**\n- **High-output profile:** Matches my derivation ($CO \\uparrow$, $TPR \\downarrow$, $PP$ widened).\n- **High-resistance profile:** Matches my derivation ($CO \\leftrightarrow / \\downarrow$, $TPR \\uparrow$, $PP$ narrowed/unchanged).\nThis option accurately describes both hemodynamic profiles based on a first-principles analysis of the clinical vignettes.\n\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\n**B. High-output phenotype: $CO$ increased, $TPR$ increased, $PP$ narrowed; High-resistance phenotype: $CO$ increased, $TPR$ increased, $PP$ widened**\n- **High-output profile:** Incorrect. $TPR$ is expected to decrease due to vasodilation, and $PP$ is expected to widen due to high stroke volume.\n- **High-resistance profile:** Incorrect. $CO$ is not typically increased, and $PP$ is not typically widened.\n\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**C. High-output phenotype: $CO$ decreased, $TPR$ decreased, $PP$ narrowed; High-resistance phenotype: $CO$ decreased, $TPR$ decreased, $PP$ widened**\n- **High-output profile:** Incorrect. By definition, $CO$ must be increased in a high-output state.\n- **High-resistance profile:** Incorrect. $TPR$ must be increased in a high-resistance state.\n\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**D. High-output phenotype: $CO$ increased, $TPR$ decreased, $PP$ narrowed; High-resistance phenotype: $CO$ decreased, $TPR$ increased, $PP$ widened**\n- **High-output profile:** Incorrect. The \"bounding pulses\" are a clinical sign of a widened, not narrowed, $PP$.\n- **High-resistance profile:** Incorrect. While $CO$ may be decreased and $TPR$ is increased, a widened $PP$ is not the characteristic finding; it is more characteristic of the high-output state or isolated systolic hypertension in the elderly due to very stiff arteries with a preserved $SV$. The contrast between the two phenotypes makes \"widened\" a poor fit here.\n\n**Verdict: Incorrect**",

Only $6.25\\%$ of the peak concentration from the last dose is expected to remain. This is a small amount, and a qualitative urine screen could plausibly be negative even in a fully adherent patient. Therefore, a negative valsartan test at $24$ hours is weak evidence for non-adherence.\n\nNow, we evaluate each patient's profile.\n\n#### Option A\n*   **Office BP**: $158/96$ mm Hg (Hypertensive).\n*   **Measurement Error**: The cuff bladder width to arm circumference ratio is $w/c = 9/34 \\approx 0.26$. This is significantly less than the ideal of $0.4$, indicating an **undersized cuff**. This is a known cause of artifactually high BP readings. This strongly suggests measurement error contributed to the high office BP.\n*   **White-Coat Effect**: The ABPM results are all within the normal range: $24$-hour mean $124/76$ mm Hg (below $130/80$), daytime mean $128/78$ mm Hg (below $135/85$), and nighttime mean $110/64$ mm Hg (below $120/70$). The discrepancy between the high office BP and normal ABPM is the definition of **white-coat effect**.\n*   **Adherence**: Amlodipine and chlorthalidone are detectable as expected. The negative valsartan test is pharmacokinetically plausible. No evidence of non-adherence.\n*   **Verdict**: **Incorrect**. This patient's high office BP is fully explained by a combination of measurement error and white-coat effect. This is a classic case of pseudoresistance, not true resistant hypertension.\n\n#### Option B\n*   **Office BP**: $160/100$ mm Hg (Hypertensive).\n*   **Measurement Error**: The cuff ratio is $w/c = 13/32 \\approx 0.41$. This is ideal. Measurement error due to cuff size is **ruled out**.\n*   **White-Coat Effect**: The ABPM results are all hypertensive: $24$-hour mean $138/88$ mm Hg (above $130/80$), daytime mean $144/92$ mm Hg (above $135/85$), and nighttime mean $130/82$ mm Hg (above $120/70$). This confirms sustained hypertension and **rules out a white-coat effect**.\n*   **Adherence**: Plasma levels of the long-acting drugs (amlodipine, chlorthalidone) are stable and consistent with steady-state dosing, suggesting good adherence. Most critically, a repeat ABPM performed after **directly observed therapy (DOT)** still shows significant hypertension. DOT provides definitive proof of adherence for that dosing interval. The persistence of hypertension under these conditions is the strongest possible evidence for true pharmacological resistance.\n*   **Verdict**: **Correct**. This patient's profile systematically excludes all common forms of pseudoresistance. The hypertension is confirmed by ABPM, measurement technique is appropriate, and adherence is confirmed by both stable drug levels and, most convincingly, a DOT trial. This is the archetypal presentation of true resistant hypertension.\n\n#### Option C\n*   **Office BP**: $170/100$ mm Hg (Hypertensive).\n*   **Measurement Error**: The cuff ratio is $w/c = 12/33 \\approx 0.36$. This is reasonably close to $0.4$, making significant measurement error unlikely.\n*   **White-Coat Effect**: The ABPM results are all normal: $24$-hour mean $125/77$ mm Hg, daytime mean $132/80$ mm Hg, nighttime mean $112/68$ mm Hg. This indicates a significant **white-coat effect**.\n*   **Adherence**: Plasma amlodipine and chlorthalidone are **undetectable**. Given their long half-lives, their absence at the $24$-hour trough is definitive evidence of **non-adherence**.\n*   **Verdict**: **Incorrect**. This patient's apparently uncontrolled BP is due to a combination of proven non-adherence and a white-coat effect. This is pseudoresistance.\n\n#### Option D\n*   **Office BP**: $162/98$ mm Hg (Hypertensive).\n*   **Measurement Error**: The cuff ratio is $w/c = 14/35 = 0.40$. This is ideal. Measurement error is **ruled out**.\n*   **White-Coat Effect**: The daytime ABPM mean is $137/86$ mm Hg, which is above the threshold of $135/85$ mm Hg. This confirms sustained hypertension and rules out a pure white-coat effect.\n*   **Adherence**: There is strong, multi-faceted evidence for **poor adherence**. Pharmacokinetic testing is inconsistent (\"borderline low\", \"undetectable\"), which is the hallmark of intermittent dosing. Furthermore, the pharmacy refill history shows significant gaps, providing objective, external corroboration of non-adherence.\n*   **Verdict**: **Incorrect**. While this patient has true, sustained hypertension (not white-coat effect), the most probable cause is poor adherence, which is a form of pseudoresistance. Before diagnosing true resistant hypertension, adherence issues must be resolved.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nPatient B is the only candidate for whom the common confounders—measurement error, white-coat effect, and non-adherence—have been convincingly excluded. The combination of sustained hypertension on ABPM, correct cuff sizing, and persistent hypertension even under directly observed therapy provides the strongest support for a diagnosis of true resistant hypertension.",
