This practice focuses on disinhibition, a critical mechanism where inhibitory signaling fails. You will apply the Nernst equation to a clinically relevant scenario to see how altered ion gradients can fundamentally change a neuron's response to GABA, turning a brake into an accelerator.

            "problem": "A dorsal horn interneuron implicated in nociceptive processing exhibits altered chloride homeostasis in a neuropathic state. Assume the membrane is selectively permeable to chloride ions through gamma-aminobutyric acid type A (GABA$_A$) receptor channels, which conduct chloride with valence $z=-1$. The intracellular and extracellular chloride activities can be approximated by their concentrations. At temperature $T=310\\ \\mathrm{K}$, the measured concentrations are $[Cl^{-}]_{\\mathrm{in}}=20\\ \\mathrm{mM}$ and $[Cl^{-}]_{\\mathrm{out}}=110\\ \\mathrm{mM}$. The resting membrane potential is $V_{\\mathrm{rest}}=-65\\ \\mathrm{mV}$. \n\nStarting from the equality of electrochemical potentials at equilibrium and the definition of membrane potential, derive the Nernst relation appropriate for an anion and compute the chloride reversal potential $E_{Cl}$. Then use the sign of the driving force at rest, given by $V_{\\mathrm{rest}}-E_{Cl}$, as a criterion to decide whether instantaneous GABA$_A$ activation is hyperpolarizing (inhibitory) or depolarizing (excitatory) at rest. Define an indicator $s$ by\n- $s=-1$ if $E_{Cl}<V_{\\mathrm{rest}}$ (hyperpolarizing at rest, inhibitory),\n- $s=0$ if $E_{Cl}=V_{\\mathrm{rest}}$ (no net voltage change at rest),\n- $s=+1$ if $E_{Cl}>V_{\\mathrm{rest}}$ (depolarizing at rest, excitatory).\n\nReport your final answer as the ordered pair $\\big(E_{Cl}, s\\big)$ using a row matrix, with $E_{Cl}$ expressed in millivolts and $s$ dimensionless. Round $E_{Cl}$ to four significant figures. Use the universal gas constant $R$, Faraday constant $F$, and absolute temperature $T$ as needed, and assume ideal behavior of ions in solution.",
            "solution": "First, we derive the Nernst relation for an anion starting from the principle of thermodynamic equilibrium. The electrochemical potential, $\\tilde{\\mu}_j$, for an ionic species $j$ is given by:\n$$\n\\tilde{\\mu}_j = \\mu_j^0 + RT \\ln(a_j) + z_j F V\n$$\nwhere $\\mu_j^0$ is the standard chemical potential, $R$ is the universal gas constant, $T$ is the absolute temperature, $a_j$ is the activity of the ion, $z_j$ is its valence, $F$ is the Faraday constant, and $V$ is the electrical potential.\n\nAt equilibrium, there is no net flux of the ion across the membrane, which implies that the electrochemical potential of the ion is equal on both sides of the membrane (intracellular and extracellular):\n$$\n\\tilde{\\mu}_{j, \\text{in}} = \\tilde{\\mu}_{j, \\text{out}}\n$$\nSubstituting the expression for the electrochemical potential, we have:\n$$\n\\mu_j^0 + RT \\ln(a_{j, \\text{in}}) + z_j F V_{\\text{in}} = \\mu_j^0 + RT \\ln(a_{j, \\text{out}}) + z_j F V_{\\text{out}}\n$$\nThe standard chemical potential $\\mu_j^0$ is the same on both sides and cancels out. Rearranging the terms to solve for the potential difference across the membrane, $V_{\\text{in}} - V_{\\text{out}}$, which is defined as the equilibrium potential or Nernst potential, $E_j$:\n$$\nz_j F (V_{\\text{in}} - V_{\\text{out}}) = RT \\ln(a_{j, \\text{out}}) - RT \\ln(a_{j, \\text{in}})\n$$\n$$\nz_j F E_j = RT \\ln\\left(\\frac{a_{j, \\text{out}}}{a_{j, \\text{in}}}\\right)\n$$\n$$\nE_j = \\frac{RT}{z_j F} \\ln\\left(\\frac{a_{j, \\text{out}}}{a_{j, \\text{in}}}\\right)\n$$\nThe problem states that activities can be approximated by concentrations, so $a_j \\approx [j]$. For the chloride ion, $Cl^-$, the valence is $z_{Cl} = -1$. The Nernst potential for chloride, $E_{Cl}$, is therefore:\n$$\nE_{Cl} = \\frac{RT}{(-1)F} \\ln\\left(\\frac{[Cl^-]_{\\text{out}}}{[Cl^-]_{\\text{in}}}\\right) = -\\frac{RT}{F} \\ln\\left(\\frac{[Cl^-]_{\\text{out}}}{[Cl^-]_{\\text{in}}}\\right)\n$$\nThis relation can also be written in an equivalent form by inverting the argument of the logarithm:\n$$\nE_{Cl} = \\frac{RT}{F} \\ln\\left(\\frac{[Cl^-]_{\\text{in}}}{[Cl^-]_{\\text{out}}}\\right)\n$$\nThis is the appropriate Nernst relation for an anion like chloride.\n\nNext, we compute the numerical value of $E_{Cl}$ using the given data:\n- Temperature, $T = 310 \\ \\mathrm{K}$\n- Intracellular chloride concentration, $[Cl^-]_{\\text{in}} = 20 \\ \\mathrm{mM}$\n- Extracellular chloride concentration, $[Cl^-]_{\\text{out}} = 110 \\ \\mathrm{mM}$\n- Universal gas constant, $R \\approx 8.314 \\ \\mathrm{J \\cdot mol^{-1} \\cdot K^{-1}}$\n- Faraday constant, $F \\approx 96485 \\ \\mathrm{C \\cdot mol^{-1}}$\n- Chloride valence, $z_{Cl} = -1$\n\nSubstituting these values into the derived Nernst equation:\n$$\nE_{Cl} = \\frac{(8.314 \\ \\mathrm{J \\cdot mol^{-1} \\cdot K^{-1}})(310 \\ \\mathrm{K})}{(-1)(96485 \\ \\mathrm{C \\cdot mol^{-1}})} \\ln\\left(\\frac{110 \\ \\mathrm{mM}}{20 \\ \\mathrm{mM}}\\right)\n$$\nThe units $\\mathrm{J/C}$ yield Volts. The concentration units ($\\mathrm{mM}$) cancel within the logarithm.\n$$\nE_{Cl} = -\\frac{2577.34}{96485} \\ \\mathrm{V} \\cdot \\ln(5.5)\n$$\n$$\nE_{Cl} \\approx -0.026712 \\ \\mathrm{V} \\cdot (1.704748)\n$$\n$$\nE_{Cl} \\approx -0.045543 \\ \\mathrm{V} = -45.543 \\ \\mathrm{mV}\n$$\nRounding to four significant figures as requested, we get:\n$$\nE_{Cl} = -45.54 \\ \\mathrm{mV}\n$$\nFinally, we determine the indicator $s$ by comparing $E_{Cl}$ with the resting membrane potential, $V_{\\text{rest}} = -65 \\ \\mathrm{mV}$. The definition of $s$ is based on the relationship between these two potentials.\n- We have $E_{Cl} = -45.54 \\ \\mathrm{mV}$ and $V_{\\text{rest}} = -65 \\ \\mathrm{mV}$.\n- We compare these values: $-45.54 > -65$.\n- This corresponds to the case $E_{Cl} > V_{\\text{rest}}$.\n- According to the problem definition, if $E_{Cl} > V_{\\text{rest}}$, then $s = +1$.\n\nThis result indicates that the reversal potential for chloride is less negative than the resting membrane potential. Consequently, if GABA$_A$ receptor channels were to open, the net movement of $Cl^-$ ions would be an efflux (out of the cell) because the membrane potential is more negative than the chloride equilibrium potential. An efflux of negative ions is a depolarizing current, which drives the membrane potential towards a less negative value (from $-65 \\ \\mathrm{mV}$ towards $-45.54 \\ \\mathrm{mV}$). This depolarization is considered excitatory in its effect.\n\nThe final answer is the ordered pair $(E_{Cl}, s)$. With $E_{Cl} = -45.54 \\ \\mathrm{mV}$ and $s = +1$, the pair is $(-45.54, 1)$.",

In a mechanistic slice physiology study of human dorsal horn interneurons, high-frequency stimulation of cutaneous C-fiber afferents is delivered at $100\\,\\mathrm{Hz}$ for $1\\,\\mathrm{s}$, repeated $3$ times with $10\\,\\mathrm{s}$ intervals, from a holding potential of $-70\\,\\mathrm{mV}$. This stimulation paradigm is known to depolarize the postsynaptic membrane sufficiently to relieve the magnesium block of the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDA receptor), allowing calcium influx that can trigger long-term potentiation (LTP), a form of synaptic strengthening implicated in central sensitization and clinical hyperalgesia.\n\nExcitatory postsynaptic current (EPSC) amplitudes are measured as averages over $15$ consecutive sweeps immediately before stimulation (baseline) and $30$ to $40\\,\\mathrm{min}$ after stimulation (post-induction).

            "solution": "The problem requires an explanation that integrates a set of specific sensory and electrophysiological findings. We will analyze the findings by breaking them down according to the function of different sensory nerve fiber classes.\n\n1.  **Analysis of Large-Fiber ($A\\beta$) Function:**\n    *   Large, myelinated $A\\beta$ fibers are responsible for transmitting sensations of light touch, pressure, and vibration.\n    *   The patient's `Mechanical detection threshold for light touch` is normal.\n    *   The `Vibration detection threshold at $125\\,$Hz` is normal.\n    *   `Nerve conduction studies` (NCS), which primarily assess the function of the fastest-conducting large myelinated fibers, are normal.\n    *   **Conclusion:** These three independent findings converge to demonstrate that the function of large $A\\beta$ fibers is preserved.\n\n2.  **Analysis of Small-Fiber ($A\\delta$ and $C$) Function:**\n    *   Small, thinly myelinated $A\\delta$ fibers mediate sensations of cold and sharp, fast pain.\n    *   Small, unmyelinated $C$ fibers mediate sensations of warmth and dull, burning, slow pain.\n    *   The patient's `Warm detection threshold is elevated` (warm hypesthesia), indicating $C$-fiber dysfunction.\n    *   The `Heat pain threshold is shifted upward` (thermal hypoalgesia), indicating dysfunction in heat-sensitive nociceptors (primarily $C$ fibers, with some $A\\delta$ contribution).\n    *   The `Cold detection threshold is mildly elevated`, indicating $A\\delta$ fiber dysfunction.\n    *   The primary complaint of `length-dependent burning dysesthesia` is a classic symptom of neuropathic pain originating from pathology in small nociceptive fibers, especially $C$ fibers.\n    *   **Conclusion:** There is clear evidence of dysfunction and loss of function (deafferentation) in both $A\\delta$ and $C$ small fibers. This pattern is pathognomonic for a **small-fiber neuropathy**.\n\n3.  **Analysis of Dynamic Mechanical Allodynia:**\n    *   This is the most complex finding to explain. Allodynia is the perception of pain from a stimulus that is not normally painful. In this case, `light brushing` (a low-threshold mechanical stimulus) evokes severe pain ($7/10$).\n    *   Light brushing activates low-threshold mechanoreceptors, whose signals are transmitted by the intact $A\\beta$ fibers.\n    *   The puzzle is: how can a normal touch signal, traveling along a normal $A\\beta$ fiber, be interpreted as pain by the central nervous system?\n    *   This phenomenon cannot be adequately explained by peripheral mechanisms alone, especially given the evidence of small-fiber *loss* (hypoesthesia), not sensitization. Peripheral sensitization would lower pain thresholds (hyperalgesia), but here the thermal pain threshold is *elevated* (hypoalgesia).\n    *   The established mechanism for this type of allodynia is **central sensitization** in the spinal cord dorsal horn. The chronic loss of input from $A\\delta$ and $C$ fibers (deafferentation) triggers neuroplastic changes:\n        *   **Disinhibition:** A reduction in the normal inhibitory tone (e.g., GABAergic or glycinergic) that typically segregates tactile and nociceptive pathways.\n        *   **Sprouting and Synaptic Reorganization:** Low-threshold $A\\beta$ afferents may sprout from their normal termination sites (laminae III-V) into more superficial laminae (I-II), where nociceptive projection neurons are located.\n    *   As a result of these central changes, the non-nociceptive signal from $A\\beta$ fibers gains access to and powerfully activates the now hyperexcitable and disinhibited second-order nociceptive neurons. This signal then ascends via the spinothalamic tract and is interpreted by the brain as pain.\n\n**Integrated Synthesis:**\nThe most parsimonious explanation for the entire clinical picture is a primary small-fiber neuropathy causing deafferentation of the spinal dorsal horn. This deafferentation leads to secondary central sensitization, which in turn causes intact $A\\beta$ fiber input to be misperceived as pain, producing dynamic mechanical allodynia.\n\n**Option-by-Option Analysis:**\n\n*   **A. Predominant small-fiber ($A\\delta$ and $C$) deafferentation with intact low-threshold mechanoreceptor $A\\beta$ input, leading to dorsal horn central sensitization and disinhibition; as a result, $A\\beta$ input engages nociceptive projection neurons via polysynaptic excitatory circuits, producing dynamic mechanical allodynia despite preserved vibration sense.**\n    *   This statement accurately reflects the step-by-step derivation above. It correctly identifies the small-fiber deafferentation, the preserved $A\\beta$ function, the resulting central sensitization, and the mechanism by which $A\\beta$ input triggers allodynia. This option integrates all findings into a coherent and scientifically accepted model.\n    *   **Verdict: Correct.**\n\n*   **B. Primary large-fiber ($A\\beta$) demyelinating neuropathy with ephaptic cross-talk into nociceptive afferents, accounting for dynamic mechanical allodynia; vibration sense remains preserved due to redundant recruitment of parallel dorsal column pathways.**\n    *   This option is fundamentally flawed because it posits a `primary large-fiber ($A\\beta$) neuropathy`. This is directly contradicted by the normal vibration sense, normal light touch threshold, and normal NCS results. The entire premise is incorrect.\n    *   **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n*   **C. Pure peripheral sensitization of cutaneous mechanonociceptors ($A\\delta$) such that their activation thresholds drop into the range of light brushing forces, explaining allodynia without requiring central changes; preserved vibration reflects sparing of $A\\beta$ fibers.**\n    *   This option proposes a purely peripheral mechanism. It fails to account for the clear signs of small-fiber *loss of function* (elevated warm, cold, and heat pain thresholds). Peripheral sensitization would lead to hyperalgesia (lowered thresholds), the opposite of what is observed for thermal stimuli. Therefore, this model is inconsistent with the QST data.\n    *   **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n*   **D. Cervical dorsal column lesion selectively interrupting $A\\beta$ projections to the dorsal column nuclei, forcing tactile signals to be rerouted through the spinothalamic tract, thereby generating mechanical allodynia but sparing vibration detection.**\n    *   This option proposes an incorrect location and a flawed mechanism. A `cervical` lesion is inconsistent with the `length-dependent` symptoms starting in the `feet`. Furthermore, a lesion in the `dorsal column` would impair vibration and proprioception, which are noted to be intact (vibration sense is normal). The premise contradicts the data.\n    *   **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n*   **E. Thalamic ventral posterolateral nucleus lesion causing central pain with touch–pain misperception that manifests as dynamic mechanical allodynia while preserving dorsal column-mediated vibration sense due to thalamic sensory reweighting.**\n    *   This option posits a primary brain lesion. While a thalamic lesion can cause central pain and allodynia, it does not explain the peripheral signs of small-fiber neuropathy (elevated thermal thresholds), which point to a problem with the primary sensory neurons. Additionally, a unilateral thalamic lesion would typically cause contralateral symptoms, not the symmetric, length-dependent pattern described. The pathology originates in the periphery, not the thalamus.\n    *   **Verdict: Incorrect.**",
