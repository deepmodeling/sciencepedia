We will practice the fundamental mechanics of converting a pre-test probability into odds, applying a positive likelihood ratio ($LR^{+}$) from a diagnostic test, and converting the resulting post-test odds back into a probability. This exercise demonstrates how a quantitative approach can move a diagnosis across a pre-defined treatment threshold, directly linking probabilistic reasoning to a clinical action. ",

You estimate the pretest probability of a target condition (for example, acute pulmonary embolism) as $p_{0} = 0.30$ based on clinical gestalt and available preliminary information. A subsequent diagnostic test returns positive, and its positive likelihood ratio is $LR^{+} = 6$. You use Bayesian reasoning in odds form, beginning from definitions, to update the probability of disease after this positive test.\n\nStarting from core definitions and Bayes' theorem, derive the odds-based update from pretest probability to posttest probability using $LR^{+}$, compute the posterior probability $p_{1}$, and then compare $p_{1}$ to a prespecified treatment threshold $T = 0.65$.

We may therefore proceed with the solution.\n\nThe problem requires us to start from core definitions to derive the odds-based Bayesian update rule, calculate the post-test probability of disease, and then determine the decision margin relative to a given treatment threshold.\n\nLet $D$ be the event that the patient has the target condition, and let $T^{+}$ be the event that a diagnostic test for this condition returns a positive result.\nThe pre-test probability of disease is given as $P(D) = p_{0} = 0.30$.\nThe post-test probability of disease, given a positive test result, is denoted by $p_{1} = P(D|T^{+})$.\nThe positive likelihood ratio is given as $LR^{+} = 6$.\n\nThe odds of an event $E$ are defined as the ratio of the probability of the event occurring to the probability of it not occurring:\n$$O(E) = \\frac{P(E)}{1-P(E)}$$\nThe pre-test odds, $O_{pre}$, are the odds of disease before the test is performed:\n$$O_{pre} = \\frac{P(D)}{1-P(D)} = \\frac{P(D)}{P(D^c)}$$\nwhere $D^c$ is the complement of $D$, i.e., the patient does not have the disease.\n\nThe post-test odds, $O_{post}$, are the odds of disease after receiving a positive test result:\n$$O_{post} = \\frac{P(D|T^{+})}{1-P(D|T^{+})} = \\frac{P(D|T^{+})}{P(D^c|T^{+})}$$\n\nWe use Bayes' theorem to express the posterior probabilities $P(D|T^{+})$ and $P(D^c|T^{+})$:\n$$P(D|T^{+}) = \\frac{P(T^{+}|D)P(D)}{P(T^{+})}$$\n$$P(D^c|T^{+}) = \\frac{P(T^{+}|D^c)P(D^c)}{P(T^{+})}$$\nSubstituting these into the expression for post-test odds gives:\n$$O_{post} = \\frac{\\frac{P(T^{+}|D)P(D)}{P(T^{+})}}{\\frac{P(T^{+}|D^c)P(D^c)}{P(T^{+})}}$$\nThe term $P(T^{+})$ cancels out, yielding:\n$$O_{post} = \\frac{P(T^{+}|D)P(D)}{P(T^{+}|D^c)P(D^c)} = \\left(\\frac{P(T^{+}|D)}{P(T^{+}|D^c)}\\right) \\left(\\frac{P(D)}{P(D^c)}\\right)$$\nWe recognize the components of this equation. The first term is the definition of the positive likelihood ratio, $LR^{+}$:\n$$LR^{+} = \\frac{P(T^{+}|D)}{P(T^{+}|D^c)}$$\nThe second term is the definition of the pre-test odds, $O_{pre}$.\nTherefore, we have derived the odds-based update rule:\n$$O_{post} = LR^{+} \\times O_{pre}$$\nThis equation states that the post-test odds are the pre-test odds multiplied by the likelihood ratio.\n\nNow, we can apply this formula using the given values.\nThe pre-test probability is $p_{0} = 0.30$.\nThe pre-test odds are:\n$$O_{pre} = \\frac{p_{0}}{1-p_{0}} = \\frac{0.30}{1-0.30} = \\frac{0.30}{0.70} = \\frac{3}{7}$$\nThe positive likelihood ratio is $LR^{+} = 6$.\nThe post-test odds are:\n$$O_{post} = LR^{+} \\times O_{pre} = 6 \\times \\frac{3}{7} = \\frac{18}{7}$$\nTo find the post-test probability $p_{1}$, we must convert the post-test odds back to a probability.

We can now calculate $m$:\n$$m = p_{1} - T = 0.72 - 0.65 = 0.07$$\nThe problem requires the final answer to be expressed as a decimal number rounded to four significant figures.

This practice explores the critical, and often underappreciated, role of pre-test probability in determining the clinical utility of a diagnostic test. By analyzing two hypothetical patients with vastly different initial probabilities for a disease, we will see how the same test result, with an identical likelihood ratio ($LR^{+}$), can lead to different post-test probabilities and, consequently, different clinical decisions.

            "problem": "An undifferentiated adult presents with nonspecific constitutional symptoms and focal findings that could be attributable to a serious but treatable condition (call this condition $D$). You are considering whether to initiate a therapy whose benefit when $D$ is present is $B_T$ and harm when $D$ is absent is $H_T$, with $B_T$ measured in consistent expected-utility units. Two patients differ only in their pretest probabilities for $D$: Patient $1$ has $p_0 = 0.05$ and Patient $2$ has $p_0 = 0.40$. You order the same diagnostic test for both; when the test is positive, it has a positive likelihood ratio (LR+) of $LR_{+} = 5$. The therapy has $B_T = 7$ and $H_T = 3$, and you will treat immediately after a positive test if the posttest probability of $D$, denoted $p_{\\text{post}}$, meets or exceeds the treatment threshold implied by these values. Using only first principles of probabilistic inference for diagnostic tests and expected-utility decision thresholds, compute the posttest probabilities $p_{\\text{post}}$ for each patient after a positive test and determine whether to treat each patient immediately.

            "solution": "The problem statement is evaluated for validity.\n\n### Step 1: Extract Givens\n-   Condition of interest: $D$\n-   Benefit of therapy when $D$ is present: $B_T = 7$ (in expected-utility units)\n-   Harm of therapy when $D$ is absent: $H_T = 3$ (in expected-utility units)\n-   Patient 1 pretest probability for $D$: $p_0 = 0.05$\n-   Patient 2 pretest probability for $D$: $p_0 = 0.40$\n-   Diagnostic test positive likelihood ratio: $LR_{+} = 5$\n-   Decision rule: Treat if posttest probability, $p_{\\text{post}}$, meets or exceeds the treatment threshold, $p_T$.\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\nThe problem is scientifically grounded, employing standard, well-established principles of medical decision-making: Bayesian inference for updating probabilities and expected-utility theory for determining action thresholds. All data required for a solution are provided ($p_0$ for two cases, $LR_{+}$, and utility values $B_T$ and $H_T$). The parameters are numerically consistent and plausible within a hypothetical clinical scenario. The problem is well-posed, objective, and free from internal contradictions or ambiguities. It asks for a quantitative derivation and comparison based on first principles.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem statement is valid. A solution will be derived.\n\n### Derivation\nThe solution requires two primary calculations based on first principles: the treatment threshold probability ($p_T$) and the posttest probabilities ($p_{\\text{post}}$) for each patient.\n\n**1. Calculation of the Treatment Threshold ($p_T$)**\n\nThe treatment threshold is the probability of disease, $p$, at which the expected utility of treating is equal to the expected utility of not treating. Let $p$ be the probability that a patient has disease $D$.\n\nThe expected utility of treating, $EU(\\text{Treat})$, is given by the probability of having the disease multiplied by the utility of a correct treatment, minus the probability of not having the disease multiplied by the harm of an incorrect treatment. The 'benefit' $B_T$ is the net gain in utility from treating a patient with the disease, and the 'harm' $H_T$ is the net loss in utility from treating a patient without the disease. The decision to treat is justified when $EU(\\text{Treat}) \\ge EU(\\text{Do not treat})$. The threshold $p_T$ is the point of indifference:\n$$EU(\\text{Treat}) = EU(\\text{Do not treat})$$\nA standard formulation based on the given benefit and harm parameters is:\n$$p_T \\cdot B_T = (1 - p_T) \\cdot H_T$$\nThis equation balances the expected gain from treating a true positive against the expected harm from treating a false positive. We can solve for $p_T$:\n$$p_T \\cdot B_T = H_T - p_T \\cdot H_T$$\n$$p_T \\cdot B_T + p_T \\cdot H_T = H_T$$\n$$p_T (B_T + H_T) = H_T$$\n$$p_T = \\frac{H_T}{B_T + H_T}$$\nSubstituting the given values $B_T = 7$ and $H_T = 3$:\n$$p_T = \\frac{3}{7 + 3} = \\frac{3}{10} = 0.30$$\nThus, the treatment threshold is $p_T=0.30$. Treatment is indicated if the posttest probability of disease $p_{\\text{post}}$ is greater than or equal to $0.30$.\n\n**2. Calculation of Posttest Probabilities ($p_{\\text{post}}$)**\n\nThe posttest probability is calculated by updating the pretest probability using the likelihood ratio of the test result. The most direct method uses Bayes' theorem in odds form.\n\nThe pretest odds are defined as:\n$$\\text{Odds}_{\\text{pre}} = \\frac{p_0}{1 - p_0}$$\nThe posttest odds are calculated by multiplying the pretest odds by the likelihood ratio:\n$$\\text{Odds}_{\\text{post}} = \\text{Odds}_{\\text{pre}} \\times LR_{+}$$\nFinally, the posttest odds are converted back to a probability:\n$$p_{\\text{post}} = \\frac{\\text{Odds}_{\\text{post}}}{1 + \\text{Odds}_{\\text{post}}}$$\n\nWe now apply this framework to each patient.\n\n**Patient 1:**\n-   Pretest probability: $p_{0,1} = 0.05$\n-   Pretest odds: $\\text{Odds}_{\\text{pre},1} = \\frac{0.05}{1 - 0.05} = \\frac{0.05}{0.95} = \\frac{5}{95} = \\frac{1}{19}$\n-   Posttest odds (after a positive test with $LR_{+} = 5$): $\\text{Odds}_{\\text{post},1} = \\frac{1}{19} \\times 5 = \\frac{5}{19}$\n-   Posttest probability: $p_{\\text{post},1} = \\frac{5/19}{1 + 5/19} = \\frac{5/19}{24/19} = \\frac{5}{24}$\n-   As a decimal: $p_{\\text{post},1} \\approx 0.2083$\n\n**Patient 2:**\n-   Pretest probability: $p_{0,2} = 0.40$\n-   Pretest odds: $\\text{Odds}_{\\text{pre},2} = \\frac{0.40}{1 - 0.40} = \\frac{0.4}{0.6} = \\frac{2}{3}$\n-   Posttest odds (after a positive test with $LR_{+} = 5$): $\\text{Odds}_{\\text{post},2} = \\frac{2}{3} \\times 5 = \\frac{10}{3}$\n-   Posttest probability: $p_{\\text{post},2} = \\frac{10/3}{1 + 10/3} = \\frac{10/3}{13/3} = \\frac{10}{13}$\n-   As a decimal: $p_{\\text{post},2} \\approx 0.7692$\n\n**3. Clinical Decision for Each Patient**\n-   The treatment threshold is $p_T = 0.30$.\n-   For Patient 1, $p_{\\text{post},1} \\approx 0.2083$. Since $0.2083 < 0.30$, immediate treatment is not justified.\n-   For Patient 2, $p_{\\text{post},2} \\approx 0.7692$. Since $0.7692 \\ge 0.30$, immediate treatment is justified.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. $p_{\\text{post}} \\approx 0.21$ for Patient $1$ and $p_{\\text{post}} \\approx 0.77$ for Patient $2$; with a treatment threshold of $p_T = 0.30$, do not treat Patient $1$ after the positive test but treat Patient $2$, because immediate treatment is justified only when $p_{\\text{post}} \\ge p_T$.**\nThis statement's components are evaluated as follows:\n-   $p_{\\text{post}}$ for Patient 1: $5/24 \\approx 0.2083$, which rounds to $0.21$. This is correct.\n-   $p_{\\text{post}}$ for Patient 2: $10/13 \\approx 0.7692$, which rounds to $0.77$. This is correct.\n-   Treatment threshold $p_T$: The derived value is $0.30$. The statement uses this value correctly.\n-   Decision for Patient 1: $p_{\\text{post},1} \\approx 0.21 < 0.30$, so do not treat. This is correct.\n-   Decision for Patient 2: $p_{\\text{post},2} \\approx 0.77 > 0.30$, so treat. This is correct.\n-   The reasoning provided aligns with the principles of expected-utility decision theory.\nThis statement is fully consistent with the derived results.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. $p_{\\text{post}} = p_0 \\times LR_{+}$, so $p_{\\text{post}} = 0.25$ for Patient $1$ and $p_{\\text{post}} = 2.00$ for Patient $2$ (capped at $1.00$); both exceed $p_T = 0.30$, so both should be treated immediately.**\nThis statement proposes an incorrect formula for updating probability. The likelihood ratio acts multiplicatively on the odds, not directly on the probability. The formula $p_{\\text{post}} = p_0 \\times LR_{+}$ is a common but fundamental error. A probability, by definition, cannot exceed $1.0$, which this fallacious formula yields for Patient 2.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. $p_{\\text{post}}$ is identical in both patients because $LR_{+}$ is the same; therefore, the clinical decision should be the same in both cases.**\nThis statement is false. The posttest probability is a function of both the pretest probability and the likelihood ratio. As demonstrated in the calculations, a different pretest probability ($p_0$) for each patient results in a different posttest probability ($p_{\\text{post}}$) even when the test performance ($LR_{+}$) is identical. Our results show $p_{\\text{post},1} \\approx 0.21$ and $p_{\\text{post},2} \\approx 0.77$.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. $p_{\\text{post}} \\approx 0.33$ for Patient $1$ and $p_{\\text{post}} \\approx 0.67$ for Patient $2$; with $p_T = 0.30$, both should be treated after the positive test.**\nThe calculated posttest probabilities in this option ($\\approx 0.33$ and $\\approx 0.67$) do not match the correctly derived values ($\\approx 0.21$ and $\\approx 0.77$). Furthermore, the conclusion that both patients should be treated is incorrect, as Patient 1's posttest probability is below the treatment threshold.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**E. $p_{\\text{post}} \\approx 0.10$ for Patient $1$ and $p_{\\text{post}} \\approx 0.50$ for Patient $2$; a fixed additive increase from $LR_{+}$ explains the difference, and treatment depends only on whether $p_{\\text{post}}$ exceeds $p_T$.**\nThe posttest probabilities cited are incorrect. The reasoning that \"a fixed additive increase from $LR_{+}$ explains the difference\" is nonsensical from a probabilistic standpoint. The effect of the $LR_{+}$ is multiplicative on odds, which results in a non-linear transformation of probabilities. There is no fixed additive increase.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**",
