Platelet count $ 30 \\times 10^{9}$/L.\n    2. Hemolysis variable present (any evidence of microangiopathic hemolysis).\n    3. No active cancer.\n    4. No solid organ or stem cell transplant.\n    5. MCV $ 90$ fL.\n    6. INR $ 1.5$.\n    7. Creatinine $ 2.0$ mg/dL.\n- **Task:** Compute the total PLASMIC score. Explain why a high score justifies empiric plasma exchange while awaiting ADAMTS13 results, distinguishing the rationale from the management of aHUS.\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\nThe problem is evaluated against the established validation criteria.\n- **Scientifically Grounded:** The problem is firmly grounded in established medical science, specifically hematology and nephrology. The clinical presentation, laboratory values, and differential diagnosis are classic for TMAs. The PLASMIC score is a validated and widely used clinical decision rule. The pathophysiology of TTP and aHUS, the role of ADAMTS13, and the mechanisms of plasma exchange and complement inhibition are all core, evidence-based medical concepts. The problem is an excellent representation of a real-world clinical scenario.\n- **Well-Posed:** The problem is clearly stated. All data required to calculate the PLASMIC score are provided. The request for a pathophysiological explanation is specific and directs the line of reasoning. A unique numerical answer and a logically sound explanation can be derived directly from the givens.\n- **Objective:** The problem is based on objective laboratory data and explicit, non-ambiguous criteria for the scoring system. It is free from subjective or opinion-based statements.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is **valid**. It is scientifically sound, well-posed, objective, and represents a non-trivial application of medical knowledge and quantitative reasoning. I will proceed with the solution.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe solution is in two parts: calculation of the PLASMIC score and the subsequent clinical-pathophysiological explanation.\n\n**Part 1: PLASMIC Score Calculation**\n\nThe total score is the sum of points from the $7$ criteria, where each criterion is assigned $1$ point if true and $0$ if false.\n\n1.  **Platelet count $ 30 \\times 10^{9}$/L:** The patient's platelet count is $22 \\times 10^{9}$/L. Since $22  30$, this criterion is met. **Points = $1$**.\n2.  **Hemolysis variable present:** The problem defines this as \"any laboratory evidence of microangiopathic hemolysis\". The patient exhibits multiple signs: elevated LDH ($1{,}100$ U/L), elevated indirect bilirubin ($2.4$ mg/dL), undetectable haptoglobin, reticulocytosis ($5.1\\%$), and schistocytes on the peripheral smear. The presence of any one of these is sufficient. This criterion is met. **Points = $1$**.\n3.  **No active cancer:** The problem explicitly states, \"no known or suspected active cancer\". This criterion is met. **Points = $1$**.\n4.  **No solid organ or stem cell transplant:** The problem explicitly states, \"no history of solid organ or stem cell transplant\". This criterion is met. **Points = $1$**.\n5.  **Mean corpuscular volume (MCV) $ 90$ fL:** The patient's MCV is $88$ fL. Since $88  90$, this criterion is met. **Points = $1$**.\n6.  **International normalized ratio (INR) $ 1.5$:** The patient's INR is $1.1$. Since $1.1  1.5$, this criterion is met. This finding helps to exclude other causes of consumptive coagulopathy like severe disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). **Points = $1$**.\n7.  **Creatinine $ 2.0$ mg/dL:** The patient's creatinine is $2.3$ mg/dL. Since $2.3$ is not less than $2.0$, this criterion is not met. **Points = $0$**.\n\nThe total PLASMIC score is the sum of the points:\nTotal Score $= 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 0 = 6$.\n\n**Part 2: Rationale for Empiric Plasma Exchange**\n\nA PLASMIC score of $6$ indicates a high probability of severe ADAMTS13 deficiency (activity $10\\%$), the defining feature of thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP). The justification for initiating empiric plasma exchange (PEX) is based on the fundamental pathophysiological differences between TTP and atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS), the time-critical nature of TTP, and the mechanism of action of PEX.\n\n**Pathophysiology of TTP vs. aHUS:**\nBoth TTP and aHUS are forms of thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA), a pathological process of microvascular thrombosis leading to consumptive thrombocytopenia, microangiopathic hemolytic anemia (MAHA), and end-organ ischemia. However, their underlying causes are distinct.\n\n-   **TTP Pathophysiology:** TTP is caused by a severe deficiency of the enzyme ADAMTS13. In most adult cases, this is due to inhibitory autoantibodies. ADAMTS13 is a metalloprotease responsible for cleaving ultra-large von Willebrand factor (vWF) multimers into smaller, less thrombogenic forms. In its absence, these ultra-large vWF multimers persist in circulation. They are hyperactive, spontaneously binding to platelets and causing widespread, platelet-rich microthrombi to form, particularly under high shear stress conditions found in the microvasculature. This leads to profound thrombocytopenia and organ damage, with a predilection for the brain (causing neurological symptoms like confusion) and heart. Untreated, TTP has a mortality rate exceeding $90\\%$.\n\n-   **aHUS Pathophysiology:** aHUS is caused by chronic, uncontrolled activation of the alternative complement pathway on endothelial cell surfaces. This is typically due to genetic mutations in complement regulatory proteins or autoantibodies against complement factor H. The dysregulated complement cascade leads to endothelial injury, inflammation, and the formation of fibrin-and-platelet-rich thrombi. While it can affect any organ, this process has a strong predilection for the renal microvasculature, often leading to severe acute kidney injury and progression to end-stage renal disease. The patient's creatinine of $2.3$ mg/dL, which is elevated but not consistent with the most severe forms of renal failure, makes the diagnosis ambiguous; however, the fact that creatinine is $\\geq 2.0$ mg/dL is the one feature pointing more towards aHUS than TTP, lowering the PLASMIC score from a perfect $7$ to $6$.\n\n**The Clinical Dilemma and the Role of the PLASMIC Score:**\nThe clinical presentations can overlap significantly, as seen in this case. The definitive diagnosis relies on the ADAMTS13 activity level, but the test result is not immediately available. TTP is a medical emergency where immediate intervention is life-saving. A delay of $48$–$72$ hours to await the ADAMTS13 result before starting treatment would expose a patient with true TTP to an unacceptably high risk of death or irreversible ischemic organ damage (e.g., stroke).\n\nThe PLASMIC score quantifies the pre-test probability of TTP. A score of $6$–$7$ is classified as high-risk, corresponding to a $70\\%$ probability of severe ADAMTS13 deficiency. This high probability transforms the clinical uncertainty into a rational basis for action.\n\n**Rationale for Empiric PEX in High-Probability TTP:**\nThe first-line treatment for TTP is PEX. PEX has a dual therapeutic mechanism perfectly tailored to the pathophysiology of acquired TTP:\n1.  **Removal of Pathogen:** It removes the causative agent, which are the circulating anti-ADAMTS13 autoantibodies.\n2.  **Replenishment of Deficient Factor:** It replenishes the deficient enzyme (ADAMTS13) by infusing fresh frozen plasma from healthy donors.\n\nGiven a PLASMIC score of $6$, the decision is to treat for the most probable and most imminently lethal diagnosis. The principle is to initiate empiric PEX immediately. The considerable benefit of preventing death and major disability in a patient with TTP far outweighs the risks of performing PEX (e.g., central line complications, allergic reactions) on a patient who may ultimately be diagnosed with aHUS.\n\n**Contrasting with aHUS Management:**\nThe definitive treatment for aHUS is not PEX, but rather targeted inhibition of the complement pathway with monoclonal antibodies like eculizumab. While PEX was used for aHUS before complement inhibitors were developed, its efficacy is poor as it only transiently removes complement factors and provides a limited amount of functional regulators. For aHUS, the critical intervention is to block the C5 component of the complement cascade. Therefore, if the ADAMTS13 activity level returns as normal ($10\\%$), TTP is excluded. PEX would be discontinued, and therapy would be switched to a complement inhibitor to treat the presumptive diagnosis of aHUS.\n\nIn summary, a high PLASMIC score of $6$ provides a sufficiently strong statistical and clinical justification to bridge the diagnostic gap. It mandates immediate, empiric treatment with PEX for presumptive TTP, a condition where time-to-treatment is the most critical determinant of outcome, while clearly understanding that this strategy will be revised once the definitive ADAMTS13 result is available.",

The triad of microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, and acute kidney injury is clearly described and supported by appropriate laboratory values (e.g., elevated lactate dehydrogenase, undetectable haptoglobin, schistocytes, low platelets, high creatinine). The differential diagnosis considerations and the specific tests provided (ADAMTS13 activity, Shiga toxin testing, complement levels) are the standard of care for evaluating TMAs. The association between calcineurin inhibitors (tacrolimus), kidney transplantation, and secondary TMA is well-established in medical literature. The problem is firmly rooted in established pathophysiology and clinical practice.\n- **Well-Posed:** The problem provides a sufficient and complete set of clinical and laboratory data to allow for a rigorous differential diagnosis.

All data points are quantitative or represent standard clinical findings.\n\n**Conclusion of Validation:** The problem statement is scientifically sound, clinically realistic, well-posed, objective, and contains no internal contradictions or missing critical information. It is valid for proceeding to a solution.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\n- **Verdict:** The problem is valid.\n- **Action:** Proceed with a detailed solution.\n\n### Solution Derivation\nThe patient's presentation is defined by the core features of a thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA), an umbrella term for disorders characterized by systemic microvascular thrombosis. The defining features present in this case are:\n1. **Microangiopathic Hemolytic Anemia (MAHA):** Confirmed by anemia (hemoglobin $7.9\\,\\text{g/dL}$), evidence of intravascular hemolysis (high lactate dehydrogenase $1{,}150\\,\\text{U/L}$, high indirect bilirubin $2.0\\,\\text{mg/dL}$, and undetectable haptoglobin), and mechanical shearing of red blood cells (schistocytes on peripheral smear). A negative direct antiglobulin test rules out autoimmune hemolysis.\n2. **Thrombocytopenia:** A low platelet count ($48\\times 10^{9}/\\text{L}$) due to consumption in microthrombi.\n3. **End-Organ Ischemia:** Manifested as severe acute kidney injury (creatinine rise to $4.0\\,\\text{mg/dL}$ from a baseline of $1.4\\,\\text{mg/dL}$), proteinuria, and hematuria.\n\nThe next step is to differentiate the major causes of TMA:\n- **Thrombotic Thrombocytopenic Purpura (TTP):** This is caused by a severe deficiency of the ADAMTS13 (A Disintegrin and Metalloproteinase with ThromboSpondin type 1 motif, member 13) enzyme, which is responsible for cleaving ultra-large von Willebrand factor multimers. The diagnostic threshold for TTP is an ADAMTS13 activity level of $10\\%$. This patient's activity is $12\\%$. While this is at the lower end of the normal range, it is definitively above the threshold for TTP. The absence of a detectable inhibitor further argues against the most common form, immune-mediated TTP. Therefore, TTP is ruled out.\n- **Shiga toxin-producing *E. coli* Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome (STEC-HUS):** This is caused by a Shiga toxin, typically from an *E. coli* O157:H7 infection, which directly damages endothelial cells. This diagnosis is excluded by the negative stool polymerase chain reaction test for Shiga toxin.\n- **Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation (DIC):** This involves widespread activation of the coagulation cascade, leading to consumption of both platelets and clotting factors. In this patient, the prothrombin time and activated partial thromboplastin time are normal, and the fibrinogen level ($350\\,\\text{mg/dL}$) is normal-to-high (it is an acute phase reactant). This laboratory profile is inconsistent with DIC, which would typically feature prolonged clotting times and low fibrinogen.\n- **Atypical Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome (aHUS):** This is a diagnosis of exclusion after ruling out TTP and STEC-HUS. It is fundamentally a disease of dysregulated complement system activation. In this patient, the diagnosis is strongly supported by the finding of a low complement component $3$ (C3) level ($54\\,\\text{mg/dL}$) with a normal complement component $4$ (C4) level ($26\\,\\text{mg/dL}$). This pattern is the classic serological signature of alternative complement pathway activation, the central mechanism in aHUS. The alternative pathway consumes C3 but bypasses the classical pathway components C1, C2, and C4. Uncontrolled activation leads to the formation of the terminal complement complex C5b-9 (membrane attack complex) on endothelial surfaces, causing cell injury, inflammation, and thrombosis. This process is particularly damaging to the renal microvasculature.\n\nThis patient's aHUS is likely a \"secondary\" form, precipitated by known triggers in his clinical context: kidney transplantation and the use of a calcineurin inhibitor (tacrolimus). These triggers can unmask a pre-existing, often subclinical, genetic predisposition to complement dysregulation.\n\n**Management Strategy Formulation:**\nBased on the diagnosis of complement-mediated HUS (aHUS):\n1. The cornerstone of treatment is to specifically inhibit the pathogenic pathway. This is achieved by blocking the terminal complement cascade. Inhibitors of complement component C5 (eculizumab, ravulizumab) prevent the cleavage of C5 into C5a and C5b, thereby blocking the formation of the pro-thrombotic and pro-inflammatory C5b-9 complex. This is an urgent, organ-saving intervention.\n2. Therapeutic plasma exchange (TPE) was initiated empirically for suspected TTP. Now that TTP is ruled out, TPE should be discontinued. It is not an effective treatment for aHUS and its continuation delays the administration of definitive C5 inhibitor therapy.\n3. The likely trigger, tacrolimus, should be stopped and replaced with a suitable alternative immunosuppressant under the guidance of the transplant team.\n4. A critical safety consideration for C5 inhibition is the increased risk of infection with encapsulated organisms, particularly *Neisseria meningitidis*. Patients must receive a meningococcal vaccine. If treatment must be started immediately before vaccination can be administered or take effect, prophylactic antibiotics (e.g., penicillin or ciprofloxacin) are mandatory.\n5. Supportive care, including aggressive control of hypertension and management of acute kidney injury (with renal replacement therapy if necessary), remains critical.\n\n**Evaluation of Options**\n\n**A. Continue daily therapeutic plasma exchange and high-dose glucocorticoids while awaiting repeat ADAMTS13 testing; defer complement blockade until genetic studies return**\n- **Analysis:** This action is inappropriate. ADAMTS13 activity of $12\\%$ is sufficient to exclude TTP, making continued plasma exchange incorrect. High-dose glucocorticoids are for autoimmune conditions like immune TTP, which this patient does not have. Deferring complement blockade is dangerous and can lead to irreversible kidney failure; treatment is based on the clinical diagnosis of aHUS, not on the results of genetic studies, which are slow and do not alter the immediate need for treatment.\n- **Verdict:** Incorrect.\n\n**B. Discontinue plasma exchange now that severe ADAMTS13 deficiency is excluded; urgently initiate terminal complement blockade with a C5 inhibitor (for example, eculizumab or ravulizumab) after administering meningococcal vaccination or immediate antibiotic prophylaxis; discontinue the calcineurin inhibitor; provide supportive care including blood pressure control and renal support as needed**\n- **Analysis:** This option precisely matches the derived, evidence-based management plan. It correctly calls for discontinuing ineffective therapy (plasma exchange), initiating the definitive, mechanism-based therapy (C5 inhibition) urgently, implementing the required safety prophylaxis for C5 inhibitors, removing the likely iatrogenic trigger (calcineurin inhibitor), and continuing essential supportive care.\n- **Verdict:** Correct.\n\n**C. Treat as Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli hemolytic uremic syndrome with antibiotics (for example, azithromycin) and observation, as low C3 can occur with infection**\n- **Analysis:** This is incorrect. STEC-HUS has been ruled out by a negative Shiga toxin PCR test. Treating for it is inappropriate, and antibiotics can even be harmful in STEC infections. Observation is not an acceptable strategy for severe, progressive TMA.\n- **Verdict:** Incorrect.\n\n**D. Initiate full-dose anticoagulation for presumed disseminated intravascular coagulation and avoid complement inhibition because of infection risk**\n- **Analysis:** This is incorrect on multiple grounds. The diagnosis is not DIC, as shown by normal coagulation studies. Full-dose anticoagulation would be hazardous in a patient with a platelet count of $48\\times 10^{9}/\\text{L}$. Avoiding life-saving complement inhibition due to a manageable infection risk reflects a poor understanding of the risk-benefit analysis in this critical illness.\n- **Verdict:** Incorrect.\n\n**E. Continue plasma exchange and add rituximab to target anti-ADAMTS13 autoantibodies because ADAMTS13 activity is low, then reconsider complement inhibition if no response**\n- **Analysis:** This approach is designed for immune-mediated TTP. It is incorrect here because the patient's ADAMTS13 activity is above the TTP threshold ($12\\% > 10\\%$), and no ADAMTS13 inhibitor was detected. Rituximab has no role. Continuing plasma exchange and delaying definitive treatment for aHUS would be harmful.\n- **Verdict:** Incorrect.",

            "solution": "The validity of the problem statement must first be established.\n\n### Step 1: Extract Givens\n\n-   **Patient**: A $32$-year-old woman.\n-   **Diagnosis**: Genetically confirmed atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS).\n-   **Eculizumab Treatment History**:\n    -   Induction: $900$ mg weekly for $4$ weeks.\n    -   Week $5$: $1200$ mg.\n    -   Maintenance: $1200$ mg every $2$ weeks.\n-   **Current Timeline**: Day $3$ of week $7$.\n-   **Clinical Presentation**:\n    -   Symptoms: Dark urine, new fatigue, fever.\n    -   History: Upper respiratory tract illness for $2$ days.\n    -   Vital Signs: Temperature $38.5^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$, Blood Pressure $142/88$ mmHg.\n-   **Laboratory Data**:\n    -   Hemoglobin: $8.1$ g/dL (previously $10.5$ g/dL).\n    -   Platelets: $85 \\times 10^{9}/\\mathrm{L}$ (previously $160 \\times 10^{9}/\\mathrm{L}$).\n    -   Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH): $980$ U/L (elevated).\n    -   Haptoglobin: Undetectable.\n    -   Creatinine: $2.1$ mg/dL (baseline $1.6$ mg/dL).\n    -   Peripheral Smear: Schistocytes present.\n-   **Etiology/Trigger**: Nucleic acid testing positive for influenza A.\n-   **Pharmacokinetic/Pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) Data** (obtained just before presentation):\n    -   Eculizumab trough concentration: $35$ $\\mu$g/mL.\n    -   Total complement hemolytic activity (CH50): $25\\%$ of normal (detectable).\n-   **Prophylaxis**: Up-to-date meningococcal vaccination and on antibiotic prophylaxis.\n-   **Question**: Determine the most appropriate immediate management for the suspected breakthrough hemolysis/thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA) event.\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\n\n1.  **Scientifically Grounded**: The problem is scientifically sound. Atypical HUS is a well-defined medical condition caused by dysregulation of the alternative complement pathway. Eculizumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody that targets the C5 complement component, representing the standard-of-care treatment. Infections, such as influenza A, are established triggers for complement activation, which can overwhelm standard drug dosing and lead to breakthrough TMA. The laboratory findings—hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, and acute kidney injury—are the cardinal features of TMA. The PK/PD data are central to the problem: an eculizumab trough below the therapeutic target (typically given as $50-100$ $\\mu$g/mL) and a detectable CH50 are direct evidence of incomplete terminal complement blockade. This is a classic, realistic, and well-understood clinical scenario.\n2.  **Well-Posed**: The problem is well-posed. It provides sufficient, consistent data to allow for a reasoned decision on the immediate management. The question asks for the \"most appropriate\" action, which can be determined by applying established principles of pharmacology and pathophysiology.\n3.  **Objective**: The problem is stated using objective clinical data and widely accepted medical terminology. It is free from subjective or biased language.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\n\nThe problem statement is internally consistent, scientifically grounded, and well-posed. It provides a clear, objective basis for determining a course of action. Therefore, the problem is **valid**.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe patient is experiencing an acute flare of her atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS), a condition characterized by uncontrolled activation of the complement system leading to thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA). This is confirmed by the clinical triad of microangiopathic hemolytic anemia (low hemoglobin, elevated LDH, undetectable haptoglobin, schistocytes), thrombocytopenia (low platelets), and acute kidney injury (elevated creatinine).\n\nThe trigger for this event is the influenza A infection. Infections are potent activators of the complement cascade. This massive increase in complement activation places a high demand on the C5 inhibitor, eculizumab.\n\nThe core of the problem lies in the pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic (PD) data.\n1.  **Pharmacokinetics**: The eculizumab trough concentration is $35$ $\\mu$g/mL. For complete and sustained terminal complement inhibition, the target trough concentration is generally considered to be in the range of $50-100$ $\\mu$g/mL or higher. A level of $35$ $\\mu$g/mL is suboptimal and indicates that the patient has insufficient drug concentration to neutralize all available C5 protein, especially in a high-demand state.\n2.  **Pharmacodynamics**: The total complement hemolytic activity (CH50) is a functional assay of the entire complement pathway's ability to lyse antibody-coated erythrocytes. Complete blockade of the terminal pathway by eculizumab (which stops C5b-9 formation) should result in a CH50 of $0$ or near-zero. The finding of a CH50 of $25\\%$ of normal is direct, functional evidence that complement-mediated hemolysis is occurring. This is termed a \"PD breakthrough\" and confirms that the terminal complement pathway is not fully blocked.\n\nIn summary, the patient's standard eculizumab maintenance dose is insufficient to control the massive complement activation triggered by her influenza infection. This has resulted in incomplete C5 blockade, leading to a life-threatening TMA flare.\n\nThe immediate therapeutic goal must be to rapidly and completely re-establish terminal complement blockade to halt the ongoing organ damage. This requires increasing the eculizumab dose to overcome the increased C5 load. Simply waiting for the next scheduled dose is inadequate and dangerous. The ongoing infection will continue to drive complement activation, suggesting that a temporarily intensified dosing schedule is necessary until the trigger resolves. Concurrently, the underlying trigger (influenza A) should be treated.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. Administer an immediate supplemental eculizumab $1200$ mg dose today and temporarily shorten the maintenance interval to weekly during the infection, while treating the infection; recheck trough and CH50 in $1$ week to guide return to every $2$ weeks.**\nThis option directly addresses the pathophysiology.\n-   An immediate supplemental dose will rapidly increase the eculizumab concentration, overcoming the current C5 excess and re-instituting complete blockade.\n-   Shortening the maintenance interval to weekly is a logical response to the ongoing high-complement-activation state caused by the infection, preventing the drug level from falling into a suboptimal range again.\n-   Treating the infection is essential to remove the trigger.\n-   Rechecking trough and CH50 levels is the standard of care for monitoring therapeutic efficacy and guiding the eventual de-escalation of the dosing interval.\nThis comprehensive approach is the most appropriate management.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. Defer any changes; give the routinely scheduled maintenance dose later today and continue every $2$ weeks because week $7$ is within the standard maintenance window.**\nThis option ignores the clear evidence of active, severe TMA and the PK/PD data proving that the current regimen is failing. The patient is on day $3$ of week $7$. Her next dose is due at the end of week $7$ (day $7$), not \"later today.\" Waiting for the scheduled dose would allow for several more days of uncontrolled, organ-damaging TMA. This is incorrect and potentially harmful.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. Switch immediately to ravulizumab without giving an additional eculizumab dose, as breakthrough events indicate eculizumab failure.**\nThis event is not a \"failure\" of the drug's mechanism but a failure of the standard *dosing* to meet the patient's needs during an acute illness. It is a pharmacodynamic breakthrough. The fastest way to regain control is to give more of the drug the patient is already on. While ravulizumab is a valid long-term option, switching therapies in the midst of an acute crisis is not the standard or most rational immediate step. Furthermore, this option explicitly suggests *not* giving an additional dose, which fails to address the immediate need for complement blockade.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. Initiate urgent plasma exchange to remove circulating complement components and resume eculizumab next week once hemolysis subsides.**\nPlasma exchange (PEX) is not the first-line therapy for aHUS when a C5 inhibitor is available and the mechanism of breakthrough is understood. The problem is insufficient C5 blockade, not something PEX is best suited to fix. Most critically, this option recommends *stopping* eculizumab and waiting for hemolysis to subside, which is the opposite of the required action. The patient needs more C5 inhibition, not less.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**E. Add high-dose corticosteroids to suppress complement activation and continue the current eculizumab schedule unchanged.**\nCorticosteroids are not an effective or approved primary treatment for aHUS. Their effects on the alternative complement pathway are weak and unreliable. This option fails to address the fundamental problem, which is the inadequate eculizumab level, by proposing to continue the current, failing schedule. This would be ineffective.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**",
