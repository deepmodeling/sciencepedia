            "problem": "A patient with resistant arterial hypertension and spontaneous hypokalemia undergoes standardized biochemical screening for autonomous mineralocorticoid production. Interfering antihypertensive medications known to alter renin and aldosterone physiology (such as angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, diuretics, and beta-adrenergic receptor antagonists) have been withdrawn for 2 weeks, serum potassium is normalized, and sampling is performed mid-morning after the patient has been seated quietly for 30 minutes. The laboratory reports Plasma Aldosterone Concentration (PAC) of $18$ $\\text{ng/dL}$ and Plasma Renin Activity (PRA) of $0.3$ $\\text{ng/mL/h}$. The institution’s screening criterion for a positive Aldosterone-Renin Ratio (ARR) requires renin suppression and a threshold ARR exceeding 20 when the PAC is at least $15$ $\\text{ng/dL}$.\n\nStarting from first principles of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) and the definition of renin suppression within screening algorithms for autonomous aldosterone production, compute the Aldosterone-Renin Ratio (ARR) using the laboratory’s conventional definition and then relate it to the provided threshold conceptually. Round your computed ARR to four significant figures and express it as a pure number without units.",
            "solution": "The problem requires the computation and interpretation of the Aldosterone-Renin Ratio (ARR) from provided clinical laboratory data. The validation process determines that the problem is scientifically sound, self-contained, and well-posed, based on established principles of endocrine physiology and clinical diagnostics.\n\nThe core of this problem lies in the pathophysiology of the Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone System (RAAS). Under normal physiological conditions, the RAAS is a hormonal cascade that regulates blood pressure and fluid balance. The process begins with the secretion of the enzyme renin from the kidneys in response to decreased renal perfusion or low sodium concentration. Renin cleaves its substrate, angiotensinogen, to form angiotensin I. Angiotensin I is then converted to its active form, angiotensin II, by the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE). Angiotensin II is a potent vasoconstrictor and, crucially, stimulates the adrenal cortex to secrete the mineralocorticoid hormone aldosterone. Aldosterone acts on the distal tubules and collecting ducts of the kidneys to increase the reabsorption of sodium and water, and to enhance the excretion of potassium, thereby increasing blood volume and pressure. This system is tightly regulated by negative feedback: elevated blood pressure and volume expansion suppress further renin release.\n\nThe clinical scenario describes a patient with findings suggestive of primary hyperaldosteronism, a condition characterized by autonomous aldosterone production by one or both adrenal glands, independent of regulation by the RAAS. This autonomous secretion leads to chronic, inappropriate elevation of plasma aldosterone concentration (PAC). The high aldosterone levels cause excessive sodium retention and potassium loss, manifesting as hypertension (often resistant to standard therapies) and hypokalemia, respectively. A key physiological consequence of the primary, autonomous secretion of aldosterone is the suppression of plasma renin activity (PRA) via the negative feedback loop. The chronic volume expansion resulting from aldosterone-mediated sodium and water retention inhibits the kidneys from releasing renin.\n\nThis specific pattern—a high PAC coexisting with a suppressed PRA—is the hallmark of primary hyperaldosteronism. The Aldosterone-Renin Ratio (ARR) is the standardized screening test designed to detect this dysregulated state. The ratio amplifies the diagnostic signal by dividing the inappropriately high aldosterone level by the physiologically suppressed renin level.\n\nThe problem provides the necessary data for this calculation:\nPlasma Aldosterone Concentration (PAC) = $18 \\text{ ng/dL}$\nPlasma Renin Activity (PRA) = $0.3 \\text{ ng/mL/h}$\n\nThe Aldosterone-Renin Ratio (ARR) is defined as the ratio of PAC to PRA:\n$$\n\\text{ARR} = \\frac{\\text{PAC}}{\\text{PRA}}\n$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$\n\\text{ARR} = \\frac{18 \\text{ ng/dL}}{0.3 \\text{ ng/mL/h}}\n$$\nIt is a convention in clinical chemistry that when these specific units (ng/dL for PAC and ng/mL/h for PRA) are used, the resulting ratio is reported as a unitless or pure number.\n$$\n\\text{ARR} = \\frac{18}{0.3} = 60\n$$\nThe problem requires the result to be rounded to four significant figures. The calculated value of $60$ is an exact integer. To express it with four significant figures, we write it as $60.00$.\n\nConceptually relating this result to the provided threshold involves evaluating the institutional criteria for a positive screen. A positive screen requires meeting a set of conditions that together build a strong case for autonomous aldosterone secretion.\nThe criteria are:\n$1$. The PAC must be at least $15 \\text{ ng/dL}$. The patient's PAC is $18 \\text{ ng/dL}$, which satisfies this condition ($18 \\ge 15$). This criterion prevents false positives that could arise from dividing a low-normal PAC by an extremely suppressed PRA, which could yield a high ratio of little clinical significance.\n$2$. Renin must be suppressed. The patient's PRA is $0.3 \\text{ ng/mL/h}$. In clinical practice, PRA values below $1.0 \\text{ ng/mL/h}$ are generally considered suppressed. Thus, this condition is met, confirming that the RAAS feedback mechanism is intact but is being overridden by an autonomous source of aldosterone.\n$3$. The ARR must exceed the threshold of $20$. The computed ARR is $60.00$. Since $60.00 > 20$, this condition is strongly met.\n\nAll three criteria are satisfied. The patient's biochemical profile, with an elevated PAC, suppressed PRA, and a resulting ARR of $60.00$, is highly suggestive of primary hyperaldosteronism and warrants further confirmatory testing. The high ratio is not an artifact but a true signal of aldosterone excess that is independent of renin stimulation.",

            "problem": "A patient with suspected primary hyperaldosteronism (PA) is evaluated. Primary hyperaldosteronism (PA) is defined as autonomous aldosterone production with inappropriately suppressed renin in the Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone System (RAAS). In the distal nephron principal cell, aldosterone increases epithelial sodium channel (ENaC) activity, enhances electrogenic sodium reabsorption, and secondarily drives potassium secretion through renal outer medullary potassium (ROMK) and large conductance calcium-activated potassium (BK) channels. Whole-body potassium homeostasis arises from the integration of three fundamental processes: intake from diet, distribution between intracellular and extracellular compartments, and excretion by kidney and colon. Approximately $98\\%$ of potassium resides intracellularly; insulin and $\\beta_2$-adrenergic signaling promote cellular uptake. Renal potassium secretion depends on distal sodium delivery, tubular flow, and the lumen-negative electrical gradient; with chronic potassium deficit, the kidney and colon can adapt by downregulating potassium secretory pathways and upregulating reabsorptive mechanisms, such as Hydrogen-Potassium Adenosine Triphosphatase (H,K-ATPase) in intercalated cells and colon. A $48$-year-old individual with resistant hypertension has suppressed plasma renin activity, elevated plasma aldosterone concentration, normal kidney function, and a serum potassium of $4.2$ mmol/L while not taking diuretics.\n\nWhich option best explains why many patients with PA are normokalemic and accurately states a key limitation of using serum potassium as a screening test for PA?\n\nA. In PA, the extracellular potassium pool is buffered by transcellular shifts driven by endogenous insulin and $\\beta_2$-adrenergic tone, and chronic potassium deficit triggers renal and colonic adaptations that limit further potassium loss; therefore, serum potassium has low sensitivity for PA and is an unreliable stand-alone screening test, being confounded by diet, medications, and acid-base status.\n\nB.

            "solution": "The problem statement is subjected to validation before proceeding to a solution.\n\n### Step 1: Extract Givens\n-   **Definition of Primary Hyperaldosteronism (PA):** autonomous aldosterone production with inappropriately suppressed renin in the Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone System (RAAS).\n-   **Mechanism of Aldosterone:** In the distal nephron principal cell, aldosterone increases epithelial sodium channel (ENaC) activity, enhances electrogenic sodium reabsorption, and secondarily drives potassium secretion through renal outer medullary potassium (ROMK) and large conductance calcium-activated potassium (BK) channels.\n-   **Potassium Homeostasis:** Integration of three processes: intake, distribution between intracellular and extracellular compartments, and excretion.\n-   **Potassium Distribution:** Approximately $98\\%$ of potassium resides intracellularly.\n-   **Cellular Potassium Uptake:** Promoted by insulin and $\\beta_2$-adrenergic signaling.\n-   **Renal Potassium Secretion Determinants:** Distal sodium delivery, tubular flow, and the lumen-negative electrical gradient.\n-   **Adaptation to Potassium Deficit:** With chronic potassium deficit, the kidney and colon downregulate potassium secretory pathways and upregulate reabsorptive mechanisms, such as Hydrogen-Potassium Adenosine Triphosphatase (H,K-ATPase) in intercalated cells and colon.\n-   **Patient Case:** A $48$-year-old individual with resistant hypertension has suppressed plasma renin activity, elevated plasma aldosterone concentration, normal kidney function, and a serum potassium of $4.2$ mmol/L while not taking diuretics.\n-   **Question:** Which option best explains why many patients with PA are normokalemic and accurately states a key limitation of using serum potassium as a screening test for PA?\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\nThe problem statement is assessed for validity.\n\n-   **Scientifically Grounded:** The statement is based on established principles of endocrinology and renal physiology. The descriptions of the RAAS, aldosterone's mechanism of action on the distal nephron, factors governing potassium homeostasis, and adaptive renal mechanisms are all factually correct and derived from standard medical science. The patient presentation is a classic scenario for PA. **(Valid)**\n-   **Well-Posed:** The problem provides a clear clinical context and sufficient physiological background to answer the posed question. The question asks for the best explanation among a set of options, a standard format for assessing conceptual understanding. A unique solution can be derived by evaluating the options against the provided scientific facts. **(Valid)**\n-   **Objective:** The language is clinical, precise, and devoid of subjective or opinion-based claims. All information presented is factual and relevant to the physiological concepts being tested. **(Valid)**\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem statement is scientifically sound, well-posed, objective, and contains no internal contradictions or missing information. It is deemed **valid**. The solution will proceed by deriving the correct answer and evaluating each option.\n\n### Derivation and Option Analysis\n\nThe core of the problem is to explain the observation of normokalemia in a significant fraction of patients with PA, despite aldosterone's known kaliuretic (potassium-excreting) effect, and to characterize the utility of serum potassium as a screening test.\n\n**Physiological Basis:**\n$1$. **Aldosterone's Kaliuretic Effect:** As stated, aldosterone increases the activity of the epithelial sodium channel (ENaC) in the principal cells of the distal nephron and collecting duct. This enhances sodium reabsorption from the tubular fluid into the cell. Since sodium is a cation ($Na^{+}$), its reabsorption makes the tubular lumen more electrically negative relative to the cell interior. This heightened lumen-negative electrical gradient provides a strong driving force for the secretion of potassium cations ($K^{+}$) into the tubular fluid through channels like ROMK and BK. This process is the primary cause of potassium wasting and hypokalemia in PA.\n\n$2$. **Mechanisms Counteracting Hypokalemia:** The patient in the problem is normokalemic (serum potassium of $4.2$ mmol/L, with a typical normal range of $3.5-5.0$ mmol/L), which is a common finding in modern cohorts of PA patients. Several mechanisms can explain this:\n    a. **Renal Adaptation:** As correctly stated in the problem description, chronic potassium depletion (even mild) triggers compensatory mechanisms. The kidney adapts by downregulating the expression and activity of the secretory ROMK channels in the distal nephron. Concurrently, it upregulates the activity of the Hydrogen-Potassium Adenosine Triphosphatase (H,K-ATPase) pumps in the $\\alpha$-intercalated cells of the collecting duct. This pump actively reabsorbs potassium from the tubular fluid in exchange for hydrogen ions, thereby conserving potassium. Similar adaptations occur in the colon. These adaptations can effectively counteract aldosterone-driven secretion, maintaining normokalemia.\n    b. **Potassium Buffering:** The total body potassium is vast, with approximately $98\\%$ located in the intracellular fluid (ICF). The serum potassium concentration represents only about $2\\%$ of the total and is a poor indicator of total body potassium stores. The ICF serves as a large buffer; a significant total body potassium deficit can exist while serum potassium remains within the normal range, at least initially. Factors like insulin and $\\beta_2$-adrenergic activity maintain this large intracellular-to-extracellular gradient.\n    c. **Dietary Intake:** Dietary sodium and potassium intake also play a role. A low-sodium diet would reduce distal sodium delivery, decreasing the driving force for potassium secretion. Conversely, a high-sodium diet would exacerbate it. A high-potassium diet could help maintain normokalemia by replenishing losses.\n\n**Evaluation of Serum Potassium as a Screening Test:**\n-   **Sensitivity:** Sensitivity is the ability of a test to correctly identify those with the disease. Since a large proportion (often over $50\\%$) of patients with PA are normokalemic, a screening strategy that only investigates patients with hypokalemia will miss a majority of cases. Therefore, using hypokalemia as a screening criterion has **low sensitivity**.\n-   **Specificity:** Specificity is the ability of a test to correctly identify those without the disease. Hypokalemia can be caused by many other conditions, such as diuretic use, diarrhea, vomiting, and various renal tubular disorders. Thus, hypokalemia is not specific for PA.\n\nWith this framework, we can now evaluate each option.\n\n**A. In PA, the extracellular potassium pool is buffered by transcellular shifts driven by endogenous insulin and $\\beta_2$-adrenergic tone, and chronic potassium deficit triggers renal and colonic adaptations that limit further potassium loss; therefore, serum potassium has low sensitivity for PA and is an unreliable stand-alone screening test, being confounded by diet, medications, and acid-base status.**\n-   **Explanation of Normokalemia:** This part correctly identifies two key mechanisms: the buffering role of the large intracellular potassium pool (maintained by factors like insulin and $\\beta_2$-agonists) and the crucial role of renal/colonic adaptations to chronic potassium deficit. This is a comprehensive and accurate explanation for the maintenance of normokalemia.\n-   **Limitation of Screening:** This part correctly states that serum potassium has low sensitivity because many patients are normokalemic. It also correctly notes that the test is unreliable and confounded by multiple factors, which relates to its lack of specificity and robustness.\n-   **Verdict:** **Correct**. This option is physiologically sound and accurately addresses both parts of the question.\n\n**B. In PA, aldosterone increases sodium reabsorption but does not enhance potassium secretion unless angiotensin II is elevated; therefore, normokalemia is expected and hypokalemia, when present, is a highly sensitive screening marker for PA.**\n-   **Explanation of Normokalemia:** The claim that aldosterone does not enhance potassium secretion unless angiotensin II (Ang II) is elevated is fundamentally incorrect. Aldosterone a priori enhances potassium secretion via the ENaC-dependent electrochemical gradient. In PA, renin and consequently Ang II are suppressed, yet the kaliuretic effect of autonomous aldosterone persists.\n-   **Limitation of Screening:** The statement that hypokalemia is a \"highly sensitive\" marker is the opposite of the truth. As established, because many PA patients are normokalemic, the sensitivity of a hypokalemia-based screen is low.\n-   **Verdict:** **Incorrect**. Both clauses of the option contain major physiological errors.\n\n**C. In PA, high dietary sodium intake reduces distal sodium delivery, preventing potassium secretion and maintaining normokalemia; therefore, serum potassium is a highly sensitive but nonspecific screening tool for PA.**\n-   **Explanation of Normokalemia:** The premise that \"high dietary sodium intake reduces distal sodium delivery\" is incorrect. High sodium intake leads to increased filtration and delivery of sodium to the distal nephron. This increased distal sodium delivery, in the presence of high aldosterone, *exacerbates* potassium secretion, not prevents it. This is why a high-sodium diet can unmask hypokalemia in PA patients.\n-   **Limitation of Screening:** The assertion that the test is \"highly sensitive\" is incorrect, as explained for option B.\n-   **Verdict:** **Incorrect**. The physiological explanation is the direct opposite of what occurs.\n\n**D. In PA, aldosterone upregulates Hydrogen-Potassium Adenosine Triphosphatase (H,K-ATPase) in principal cells to retain potassium, offsetting urinary losses; therefore, hypokalemia is uncommon and serum potassium is a specific early marker that can reliably screen for PA.**\n-   **Explanation of Normokalemia:** This statement contains multiple errors. First, aldosterone's primary effect on potassium is secretion, mediated in principal cells. The upregulation of H,K-ATPase is an adaptive response to potassium depletion, not a primary effect of aldosterone. Second, the H,K-ATPase is predominantly located in *intercalated cells*, not principal cells.\n-   **Limitation of Screening:** The claim that serum potassium is a \"specific early marker\" is false. It is not specific (many conditions cause hypokalemia) and it is not a reliable screening marker due to its low sensitivity.\n-   **Verdict:** **Incorrect**. This option misattributes the mechanism, the cell type, and the clinical utility of the measurement.\n\nIn summary, Option A is the only one that provides a physiologically correct explanation for normokalemia in PA and an accurate assessment of the limitations of using serum potassium for screening.",

            "solution": "The problem statement is a valid clinical vignette that is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. It presents a detailed and internally consistent set of findings—symptomatology, biochemical data, anatomical and functional imaging results, and family history—that allow for a rigorous diagnostic inference based on established principles of endocrine oncology and genetics.\n\n**1. Analysis of the Patient's Presentation**\n\nThe patient's clinical picture is characterized by several key features that must be integrated to arrive at the correct diagnosis.\n\n*   **Clinical Diagnosis:** The patient's symptoms of paroxysmal headaches, palpitations, and sustained hypertension, combined with a plasma normetanephrine level of 2,000 pg/mL (Upper Limit of Normal [ULN] 180 pg/mL), are pathognomonic for a catecholamine-secreting tumor, i.e., a pheochromocytoma or paraganglioma (PPGL).\n*   **Tumor Location and Type:** The primary tumor is a 4.2 cm para-aortic retroperitoneal mass. A tumor arising from extra-adrenal sympathetic ganglia is defined as a paraganglioma (PGL).\n*   **Biochemical Phenotype:** The markedly elevated plasma normetanephrine, a metabolite of norepinephrine, indicates the tumor is predominantly noradrenergic. This is typical for extra-adrenal PGLs, which lack the enzyme phenylethanolamine N-methyltransferase (PNMT) required to convert norepinephrine to epinephrine. The elevation in plasma 3-methoxytyramine (0.9 nmol/L, ULN 0.1 nmol/L), a metabolite of dopamine, is also significant and is frequently observed in PPGLs associated with mutations in the succinate dehydrogenase (*SDHx*) gene family.\n*   **Metastatic Disease:** The presence of multiple hepatic lesions confirms that the PGL is malignant (i.e., metastatic). The propensity for metastasis is a critical clue to the underlying genotype.\n*   **Family History:** The history of a paternal uncle with a \"carotid body tumor\"—a type of head-and-neck PGL—strongly suggests a hereditary PGL syndrome. Hereditary PGLs are most commonly caused by germline mutations in the *SDHx* genes.\n*   **Functional Imaging Phenotype:** This is a crucial piece of the diagnostic puzzle.\n    *   **$^{123}\\text{I}$-MIBG:** Metaiodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) is a norepinephrine analog. Its uptake into neuroendocrine tumor cells is mediated by the norepinephrine transporter (NET). The absence of tracer uptake (\"MIBG-negative\") implies a low density or functional absence of NET on the tumor cell membrane. This is often associated with less-differentiated, more aggressive tumors.\n    *   **$^{68}\\text{Ga}$-DOTATATE:** DOTATATE is an analog of the neuropeptide somatostatin. Its uptake is mediated by somatostatin receptors (SSTRs), particularly subtype 2 (SSTR2). Intense uptake indicates high expression of SSTRs on the tumor cell surface. The combination of MIBG non-avidity and SSTR avidity is a characteristic pattern known as the \"flip-flop\" phenomenon.\n    *   **Fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) PET:** FDG is a glucose analog, and its uptake reflects the metabolic rate of glycolysis. FDG avidity indicates a high metabolic rate, which is frequently seen in aggressive, rapidly growing, or metastatic cancers. In the context of PPGL, it points towards activation of the pseudohypoxia pathway.\n\n**2. Inference of the Underlying Genotype from First Principles**\n\nHereditary PPGL syndromes are broadly grouped into molecular clusters. The patient's features point decisively to one specific cluster and gene.\n\n*   **Cluster 1 (Pseudohypoxia Pathway):** This cluster includes mutations in *VHL*, *SDHA*, *SDHB*, *SDHC*, *SDHD*, and *SDHAF2*. These mutations disrupt the Krebs cycle or related pathways, leading to an accumulation of oncometabolites (e.g., succinate) that inhibit prolyl hydroxylases. This results in the stabilization and activation of Hypoxia-Inducible Factors (HIFs) even under normoxic conditions—a state known as pseudohypoxia. This pathway activation promotes angiogenesis, glycolysis (explaining FDG avidity), and cellular proliferation. Crucially, mutations in the *SDHx* genes, and *SDHB* in particular, are strongly associated with a de-differentiated phenotype characterized by loss of NET expression (MIBG-negative) and high SSTR expression (DOTATATE-positive).\n*   **Cluster 2 (Kinase Signaling Pathway):** This cluster includes mutations in *RET*, *NF1*, *TMEM127*, and *MAX*. These tumors typically arise from a more differentiated cell type, maintain high expression of NET, and are therefore characteristically MIBG-avid. They are most often located in the adrenal medulla and have a lower risk of metastasis compared to *SDHB*-related tumors.\n\nThe patient's presentation—an extra-adrenal, metastatic, noradrenergic/dopaminergic PGL with an MIBG-negative, DOTATATE-positive, and FDG-avid phenotype—is the classic signature of an *SDH*-deficient tumor. Among the *SDHx* genes, *SDHB* mutations are uniquely associated with a very high risk of metastasis (often reported as >30-40%), the most frequent presentation as abdominal PGLs, and frequent FDG avidity. The family history of a carotid body tumor is also consistent with an *SDHx* mutation. Thus, an *SDHB* germline mutation is the most likely underlying etiology.\n\n**3. Evaluation of Options**\n\n*   **A. *RET* proto-oncogene mutation associated with Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia (MEN) type 2; bilateral adrenal pheochromocytomas confined to the adrenals, typically MIBG-avid**\n    This option describes a Cluster 2 PPGL. It is inconsistent with the patient's extra-adrenal tumor location, metastatic disease, and MIBG-negative imaging phenotype.\n    **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n*   **B. Von Hippel–Lindau (*VHL*) disease; predominantly adrenal pheochromocytomas often MIBG-avid with additional pancreatic cystic lesions, less pronounced $^{68}\\text{Ga}$-DOTATATE avidity**\n    While *VHL* is a Cluster 1 (pseudohypoxia) disorder, its associated PPGLs are typically MIBG-avid, have a lower metastatic risk than *SDHB* tumors, and are predominantly adrenal. The patient's MIBG-negative scan and high metastatic burden are strong arguments against *VHL*.\n    **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n*   **C. Succinate dehydrogenase subunit B (*SDHB*) mutation; extra-adrenal abdominal paragangliomas with high metastatic propensity, low norepinephrine transporter expression causing poor MIBG uptake, and high somatostatin receptor 2 (SSTR2) expression yielding strong $^{68}\\text{Ga}$-DOTATATE uptake**\n    This option perfectly describes the correlation between the *SDHB* genotype and the observed phenotype. It correctly identifies the typical tumor location (extra-adrenal abdominal), the high metastatic risk (patient has hepatic metastases), the low NET expression (explaining MIBG-negativity), and the high SSTR2 expression (explaining intense DOTATATE uptake). This matches the patient's entire clinical, biochemical, and imaging profile.\n    **Verdict: Correct.**\n\n*   **D. Neurofibromatosis type 1 (*NF1*); solitary adrenal pheochromocytoma, usually MIBG-avid, low risk of metastasis**\n    This option describes a Cluster 2 PPGL. It is inconsistent with the patient's extra-adrenal location, metastatic disease, and MIBG-negative scan.\n    **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n*   **E. Succinate dehydrogenase subunit D (*SDHD*) mutation; multiple parasympathetic head-and-neck paragangliomas with robust dopamine secretion and frequent hepatic metastases**\n    This option is incorrect for a critical reason: *SDHD* mutations are associated with a very *low* risk of metastasis (5%). The patient's metastatic disease is a strong contraindication. While *SDHD* causes head-and-neck PGLs (consistent with the family history), the patient's own presentation with a metastatic abdominal tumor is the classic picture of *SDHB*, not *SDHD*. The statement \"frequent hepatic metastases\" is factually incorrect for *SDHD* mutations.\n    **Verdict: Incorrect.**",
