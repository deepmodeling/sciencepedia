            "problem": "A cardiology genetics clinic is evaluating a missense variant in the sodium voltage-gated channel alpha subunit $5$ gene (*SCN5A*) identified in a proband with a clinical phenotype consistent with an inherited cardiac channelopathy. The variant is classified using the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG) framework with the following evidence codes: PS3 (strong functional evidence for a damaging effect), PM1 (moderate evidence of location in a mutational hot-spot or functional domain), PM2 (moderate evidence of absence in population controls, for example in the Genome Aggregation Database (gnomAD)), PP3 (supporting computational evidence of deleterious effect), and BS1 (strong benign evidence for allele frequency too high, but specifically negated for *SCN5A* in this disease context).\n\nAssume the clinic applies a Bayesian quantitative framework consistent with the Clinical Genome Resource Sequence Variant Interpretation (ClinGen SVI) recommendations, where each ACMG evidence strength is mapped to a likelihood ratio (LR). For this variant, use the following likelihood ratios: PS3: $18.7$, PM1: $4.33$, PM2: $4.33$, PP3: $2.08$, BS1 (negated): $1$.

            "solution": "The problem statement has been evaluated and is deemed valid. It is scientifically grounded in the field of clinical genetics, specifically using the established ACMG/AMP framework for variant interpretation and a recognized Bayesian quantitative approach recommended by the ClinGen SVI. The problem is well-posed, providing all necessary data—a prior probability, a set of evidence codes with corresponding likelihood ratios, and an assumption of conditional independence—to calculate a unique and meaningful posterior probability. The terminology is precise and objective, and the scenario presented is a realistic representation of a common task in a clinical genetics laboratory.\n\nThe objective is to compute the posterior probability that the specified variant is pathogenic, given a set of evidence codes. This can be expressed as $P(\\text{Pathogenic} | \\text{Evidence})$. We will use Bayes' theorem, which is most conveniently applied in its odds form when dealing with likelihood ratios.\n\nLet $H_P$ be the hypothesis that the variant is pathogenic, and $H_B$ be the hypothesis that the variant is benign. The prior probability of pathogenicity is given as $P(H_P) = P_0 = 0.1$. The prior probability of the variant being benign is therefore $P(H_B) = 1 - P(H_P) = 1 - 0.1 = 0.9$.\n\nThe prior odds in favor of pathogenicity are defined as the ratio of the prior probabilities:\n$$\nO_{prior} = \\frac{P(H_P)}{P(H_B)}\n$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$\nO_{prior} = \\frac{0.1}{0.9} = \\frac{1}{9}\n$$\n\nThe evidence consists of five items, each with an associated likelihood ratio ($LR$). A likelihood ratio for a piece of evidence $E_i$ is given by $LR_i = \\frac{P(E_i | H_P)}{P(E_i | H_B)}$. The problem provides the following likelihood ratios for the given ACMG evidence codes:\n- $LR_{PS3} = 18.7$\n- $LR_{PM1} = 4.33$\n- $LR_{PM2} = 4.33$\n- $LR_{PP3} = 2.08$\n- $LR_{BS1} = 1$ (This code is negated, meaning it provides neutral evidence, which corresponds to an $LR$ of $1$.)\n\nThe problem states that these evidence items contribute independently, conditional on the pathogenicity status. Therefore, the total likelihood ratio for the combined set of evidence, $E = \\{E_{PS3}, E_{PM1}, E_{PM2}, E_{PP3}, E_{BS1}\\}$, is the product of the individual likelihood ratios:\n$$\nLR_{total} = LR_{PS3} \\times LR_{PM1} \\times LR_{PM2} \\times LR_{PP3} \\times LR_{BS1}\n$$\nSubstituting the numerical values:\n$$\nLR_{total} = 18.7 \\times 4.33 \\times 4.33 \\times 2.08 \\times 1\n$$\n$$\nLR_{total} = 18.7 \\times (4.33)^2 \\times 2.08\n$$\n$$\nLR_{total} = 18.7 \\times 18.7489 \\times 2.08\n$$\n$$\nLR_{total} = 729.256792\n$$\n\nAccording to the odds form of Bayes' theorem, the posterior odds are the product of the prior odds and the total likelihood ratio:\n$$\nO_{posterior} = O_{prior} \\times LR_{total}\n$$\nSubstituting the calculated values for $O_{prior}$ and $LR_{total}$:\n$$\nO_{posterior} = \\frac{1}{9} \\times 729.256792 \\approx 81.0285324\n$$\n\nFinally, we convert the posterior odds back into a posterior probability. The posterior probability of pathogenicity, $P_{posterior} = P(H_P | E)$, is related to the posterior odds by the formula:\n$$\nP_{posterior} = \\frac{O_{posterior}}{1 + O_{posterior}}\n$$\nSubstituting the value of $O_{posterior}$:\n$$\nP_{posterior} = \\frac{81.0285324}{1 + 81.0285324} = \\frac{81.0285324}{82.0285324}\n$$\n$$\nP_{posterior} \\approx 0.9878090\n$$\n\nThe problem requires the final answer to be rounded to $4$ significant figures.\n$$\nP_{posterior} \\approx 0.9878\n$$\nThis posterior probability places the variant in the \"Pathogenic\" classification category according to the ClinGen SVI framework, which sets a threshold of $P(\\text{Pathogenic} | \\text{Evidence}) \\ge 0.99$ for Pathogenic and $0.90 - 0.99$ for Likely Pathogenic. The calculated value of approximately $0.988$ falls into the \"Likely Pathogenic\" range. However, the exact thresholds can vary, and the calculation itself is the primary goal.

Age-related penetrance is defined as the probability that an individual who carries the variant will manifest the HCM phenotype by age $a$; denote this penetrance by $\\pi(a)$.

Provide your final expression in terms of $\\pi(a)$. No rounding is required.",
            "solution": "The problem is subjected to validation.\n\n### Step 1: Extract Givens\n- A proband has hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM).\n- The cause is a pathogenic or likely pathogenic variant in the *MYH7* or *MYBPC3* gene.\n- The proband is heterozygous for the variant.\n- The other parent is clinically unaffected and confirmed negative for the familial variant.\n- The mode of inheritance is autosomal dominant.\n- The variant segregates according to Mendelian principles.\n- Age-related penetrance is defined as $\\pi(a)$, the probability that an individual who carries the variant will manifest the HCM phenotype by age $a$.\n- Assumption: No phenocopy risk in non-carriers ($P(\\text{affected} | \\text{non-carrier}) = 0$).\n- Assumption: The de novo variant rate is negligible for the child.\n- Assumption: $\\pi(a)$ applies only to carriers.\n- Objective: Define autosomal dominant inheritance with age-related penetrance for this context and derive a closed-form expression for the per-child probability of both inheriting the familial variant and manifesting HCM by age $a$. The expression should be in terms of $\\pi(a)$.\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\nThe problem is assessed for validity.\n- **Scientifically Grounded:** The problem is based on fundamental principles of Mendelian genetics and established knowledge in medical genetics. The association of HCM with *MYH7* and *MYBPC3* genes, the autosomal dominant inheritance pattern, and the concept of age-related penetrance are all scientifically sound and central to the field. The simplifying assumptions (no phenocopy, negligible de novo rate) are standard for isolating a specific genetic risk calculation and are explicitly stated.\n- **Well-Posed:** The problem is clearly defined and structured. It provides all necessary information (parental genotypes, mode of inheritance, definition of penetrance) to derive a unique and meaningful solution. The question asks for a specific probability, which is computable from the givens.\n- **Objective:** The language is precise and unbiased. Terms like \"heterozygous,\" \"autosomal dominant,\" and \"age-related penetrance\" are standard and well-defined, leaving no room for subjective interpretation.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. It is a well-posed, scientifically sound query in quantitative medical genetics. The solution process will now proceed.\n\n***\n\nThe objective is to derive the probability that a child of the specified parents both inherits the pathogenic variant and manifests the associated phenotype (HCM) by a given age $a$.\n\nFirst, we define autosomal dominant inheritance with age-related penetrance in this context. Let $V$ represent the pathogenic variant allele and $v$ represent the normal (wild-type) allele.\nThe proband is affected and heterozygous, so their genotype is $Vv$. The other parent is unaffected and confirmed negative for the variant, so their genotype is $vv$.\n\nAccording to Mendelian principles of segregation, each parent transmits one of their two alleles to an offspring with a probability of $\\frac{1}{2}$. The possible genotypes for a child are determined by combining one allele from each parent:\n- The heterozygous parent ($Vv$) can transmit allele $V$ with probability $\\frac{1}{2}$ or allele $v$ with probability $\\frac{1}{2}$.\n- The homozygous parent ($vv$) can only transmit allele $v$ with probability $1$.\n\nThe probability of a child inheriting the pathogenic variant allele $V$ is the probability of the heterozygous parent transmitting $V$. Let $C$ be the event that the child is a carrier of the variant (genotype $Vv$).\n$$P(C) = P(\\text{parent } Vv \\text{ transmits } V) \\times P(\\text{parent } vv \\text{ transmits } v) = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 1 = \\frac{1}{2}$$\nThe probability of the child not inheriting the variant (genotype $vv$), denoted by the event $C^c$, is:\n$$P(C^c) = P(\\text{parent } Vv \\text{ transmits } v) \\times P(\\text{parent } vv \\text{ transmits } v) = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 1 = \\frac{1}{2}$$\n\nNext, we formalize the concept of age-related penetrance. Let $A_a$ be the event that an individual manifests the HCM phenotype by age $a$. The problem defines penetrance, $\\pi(a)$, as the probability that a carrier manifests the phenotype by age $a$. This is a conditional probability:\n$$P(A_a | C) = \\pi(a)$$\nThe problem also states that there is no phenocopy risk, meaning non-carriers do not develop the phenotype. This implies that the probability of manifesting the phenotype given non-carrier status is zero:\n$$P(A_a | C^c) = 0$$\n\nWe are asked to find the probability that a child both inherits the variant AND manifests the phenotype by age $a$. This corresponds to the joint probability of events $C$ and $A_a$, denoted $P(C \\cap A_a)$.\n\nUsing the definition of conditional probability, we can write:\n$$P(C \\cap A_a) = P(A_a | C) \\times P(C)$$\nWe have already established the values for both terms on the right-hand side of the equation:\n- $P(A_a | C) = \\pi(a)$ (the given penetrance function)\n- $P(C) = \\frac{1}{2}$ (the Mendelian probability of inheritance)\n\nSubstituting these values into the expression for the joint probability gives:\n$$P(C \\cap A_a) = \\pi(a) \\times \\frac{1}{2}$$\n\nThus, the probability that any given child of this couple will both inherit the familial pathogenic variant and manifest the HCM phenotype by age $a$ is $\\frac{1}{2}\\pi(a)$. This expression correctly combines the Mendelian risk of inheritance with the conditional probability of disease expression given the inherited genotype.",

You will formalize a risk-based implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) policy using a regression-based risk score that incorporates nonsustained ventricular tachycardia (NSVT), left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), male sex, and non-missense variant status. Assume the following modeling framework and parameterization are valid and already estimated from a large, well-phenotyped, gene-positive cohort:\n\n- The time-to-event model is a proportional hazards model with individual hazard function $h(t \\mid X) = h_{0}(t)\\exp(\\eta)$, where $\\eta = \\beta_{1}x_{1} + \\beta_{2}x_{2} + \\beta_{3}x_{3} + \\beta_{4}x_{4}$ is the linear predictor.\n- Covariates are defined as: $x_{1}$ is an indicator for nonsustained ventricular tachycardia (NSVT) within the past $12$ months ($x_{1} \\in \\{0,1\\}$), $x_{2}$ is the number of $10$–percentage-point decrements in LVEF below $55$ (i.e., $x_{2} = \\max\\{0, (55 - \\text{LVEF})/10\\}$), $x_{3}$ is an indicator for male sex ($x_{3} \\in \\{0,1\\}$), and $x_{4}$ is an indicator for a non-missense variant (e.g., truncating or splice; $x_{4} \\in \\{0,1\\}$).\n- Regression coefficients are: $\\beta_{1} = 0.90$, $\\beta_{2} = 0.35$, $\\beta_{3} = 0.40$, and $\\beta_{4} = 0.60$.\n- The $5$-year baseline survival (that is, survival when $\\eta = 0$) is $S_{0}(5) = 0.94$.\n\nStarting from first principles for survival and hazard in a proportional hazards model, derive a closed-form decision threshold $T$ on the linear predictor $\\eta$ such that an ICD is recommended if and only if the predicted $5$-year risk exceeds $0.10$.

            "solution": "The problem requires the derivation of a decision threshold $T$ for the linear predictor $\\eta$ in a proportional hazards model for risk stratification. The policy is to recommend an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) if the predicted $5$-year risk of a malignant ventricular arrhythmic event exceeds a certain value.\n\nThe foundation of this problem lies in survival analysis. Let $h(t)$ be the hazard function, which represents the instantaneous rate of an event at time $t$, given survival up to time $t$. The cumulative hazard function, $H(t)$, is the integral of the hazard function from time $0$ to $t$:\n$$H(t) = \\int_{0}^{t} h(u) \\,du$$\nThe survival function, $S(t)$, which is the probability of surviving past time $t$, is related to the cumulative hazard function by:\n$$S(t) = \\exp(-H(t))$$\n\nThe problem specifies a proportional hazards model, where an individual's hazard function depends on a set of covariates $X$ through a linear predictor $\\eta$. The hazard for an individual with covariates $X$ is given by:\n$$h(t \\mid X) = h_{0}(t)\\exp(\\eta)$$\nwhere $h_{0}(t)$ is the baseline hazard function (the hazard when $\\eta = 0$) and $\\eta = \\beta_{1}x_{1} + \\beta_{2}x_{2} + \\beta_{3}x_{3} + \\beta_{4}x_{4}$ is the linear predictor based on the individual's specific risk factors.\n\nThe cumulative hazard for this individual, $H(t \\mid X)$, is therefore:\n$$H(t \\mid X) = \\int_{0}^{t} h(u \\mid X) \\,du = \\int_{0}^{t} h_{0}(u)\\exp(\\eta) \\,du$$\nSince $\\exp(\\eta)$ is not a function of the integration variable $u$, it can be treated as a constant factor:\n$$H(t \\mid X) = \\exp(\\eta) \\int_{0}^{t} h_{0}(u) \\,du$$\nThe integral term is the baseline cumulative hazard, $H_{0}(t)$. Thus, we have the proportional hazards relationship for the cumulative hazard functions:\n$$H(t \\mid X) = H_{0}(t) \\exp(\\eta)$$\n\nNow, we can express the individual's survival function, $S(t \\mid X)$, in terms of the baseline survival function, $S_{0}(t)$. The individual survival is:\n$$S(t \\mid X) = \\exp(-H(t \\mid X)) = \\exp(-H_{0}(t) \\exp(\\eta))$$\nThe baseline survival function corresponds to the case where $\\eta=0$, so $S_{0}(t) = \\exp(-H_{0}(t))$. We can express the baseline cumulative hazard as $H_{0}(t) = -\\ln(S_{0}(t))$. Substituting this into the equation for $S(t \\mid X)$:\n$$S(t \\mid X) = \\exp( -(-\\ln(S_{0}(t))) \\exp(\\eta) ) = \\exp(\\ln(S_{0}(t)) \\exp(\\eta))$$\nUsing the identity $a^b = \\exp(b \\ln a)$, this simplifies to a fundamental relationship in proportional hazards models:\n$$S(t \\mid X) = [S_{0}(t)]^{\\exp(\\eta)}$$\n\nThe decision rule is to recommend an ICD if the predicted $5$-year risk exceeds $0.10$. The risk of an event by time $t$, denoted $R(t)$, is $1 - S(t)$. Therefore, the condition is:\n$$R(5 \\mid X) > 0.10$$\n$$1 - S(5 \\mid X) > 0.10$$\n$$S(5 \\mid X) < 0.90$$\n\nWe now substitute the derived expression for the survival function into this inequality:\n$$[S_{0}(5)]^{\\exp(\\eta)} < 0.90$$\nTo solve for $\\eta$, we take the natural logarithm of both sides.

Since $0 < S_{0}(5) < 1$, its natural logarithm, $\\ln(S_{0}(5))$, is a negative number. When we divide the inequality by this negative number, we must reverse the direction of the inequality sign:\n$$\\exp(\\eta) > \\frac{\\ln(0.90)}{\\ln(S_{0}(5))}$$\nTo isolate $\\eta$, we take the natural logarithm of both sides one more time. The inequality direction is preserved.\n$$\\eta > \\ln\\left( \\frac{\\ln(0.90)}{\\ln(S_{0}(5))} \\right)$$\nThe policy is to recommend an ICD when $\\eta$ exceeds this value.
