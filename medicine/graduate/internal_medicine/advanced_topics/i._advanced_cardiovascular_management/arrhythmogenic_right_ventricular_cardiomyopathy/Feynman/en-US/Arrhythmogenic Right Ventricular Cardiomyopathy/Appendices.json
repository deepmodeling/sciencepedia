            "solution": "The problem statement has been critically evaluated and is determined to be valid. It is scientifically grounded in the principles of cardiovascular physiology, well-posed with all necessary information provided, and objective in its formulation. The problem poses a clear, solvable task based on standard clinical definitions and data.\n\nThe task is to derive the expression for Right Ventricular Ejection Fraction ($RVEF$), compute its value for a given patient, and interpret the result based on provided clinical criteria for Arrhythmogenic Right Ventricular Cardiomyopathy (ARVC).\n\nFirst, we establish the fundamental definitions provided in the problem statement.\nLet $EDV_R$ denote the Right Ventricular End-Diastolic Volume, which is the volume of blood in the right ventricle at the end of diastole (filling).\nLet $ESV_R$ denote the Right Ventricular End-Systolic Volume, which is the volume of blood remaining in the right ventricle at the end of systole (contraction).\n\nThe Right Ventricular Stroke Volume, denoted as $SV_R$, is defined as the volume of blood ejected from the right ventricle in a single heartbeat. This is the difference between the end-diastolic volume and the end-systolic volume.\n$$SV_R = EDV_R - ESV_R$$\n\nThe Right Ventricular Ejection Fraction, $RVEF$, is defined as the fraction of the end-diastolic volume that is ejected during one contraction. This is expressed as the ratio of the stroke volume to the end-diastolic volume.\n$$RVEF = \\frac{SV_R}{EDV_R}$$\n\nTo derive the expression for $RVEF$ from first principles using the given variables, we substitute the expression for $SV_R$ into the equation for $RVEF$:\n$$RVEF = \\frac{EDV_R - ESV_R}{EDV_R}$$\nThis formula can also be written as:\n$$RVEF = 1 - \\frac{ESV_R}{EDV_R}$$\n\nNext, we compute the numerical value of $RVEF$ using the data provided for the $28$-year-old athlete.\nThe given measurements are:\n$EDV_R = 160\\,\\text{mL}$\n$ESV_R = 100\\,\\text{mL}$\n\nSubstituting these values into the derived formula for $RVEF$:\n$$RVEF = \\frac{160 - 100}{160} = \\frac{60}{160}$$\n\nSimplifying the fraction:\n$$RVEF = \\frac{6}{16} = \\frac{3}{8}$$\n\nTo express this as a decimal, we perform the division:\n$$RVEF = 0.375$$\n\nThe problem requires the final answer to be rounded to four significant figures. To represent $0.375$ with four significant figures, we must add a trailing zero, which is significant in this context.\n$$RVEF = 0.3750$$\n\nFinally, we interpret this result in the context of the Revised Task Force Criteria for ARVC assessment. The problem provides the following reference thresholds, which depend on the presence of regional wall motion abnormalities:\n- Major criterion: $RVEF \\leq 0.40$\n- Minor criterion: $0.40 < RVEF \\leq 0.45$\n\nOur calculated value is $RVEF = 0.3750$. We compare this to the threshold for a major criterion:\n$$0.3750 \\leq 0.40$$\nThis inequality is true. Therefore, the patient's calculated Right Ventricular Ejection Fraction of $0.3750$ meets the quantitative threshold for a major diagnostic criterion for ARVC, under the condition that regional right ventricular wall motion abnormalities are also present, as stipulated by the criteria.",

Transthoracic echocardiography is performed using standard right ventricular (RV) views and measurements as recommended by professional society guidelines, and the following findings are observed: regional right ventricular akinesia on the free wall; a Parasternal Long-Axis (PLAX) Right Ventricular Outflow Tract (RVOT) diameter of $33 \\text{ mm}$; a Parasternal Short-Axis (PSAX) RVOT diameter of $37 \\text{ mm}$; and a right ventricular Fractional Area Change (FAC) of $31\\%$.

            "solution": "The problem statement is scientifically sound and well-posed, providing a specific clinical scenario and quantitative data that can be evaluated against established, objective medical guidelines. The provided information is sufficient and internally consistent.\n\nThe problem requires the classification of echocardiographic findings within the diagnostic framework for Arrhythmogenic Right Ventricular Cardiomyopathy (ARVC), as defined by the 2010 revised Task Force Criteria. These criteria are the fundamental principles for this problem. They categorize imaging findings of right ventricular (RV) structural and functional abnormalities into major and minor criteria.\n\nFirst, let us state the 2010 Task Force Criteria for echocardiographic abnormalities in ARVC.\n\nA **major criterion** is met if there is:\nRegional RV akinesia, dyskinesia, or aneurysm\n**AND** one of the following:\n1.  Parasternal Long-Axis (PLAX) Right Ventricular Outflow Tract (RVOT) $\\ge 32 \\text{ mm}$ (or indexed to Body Surface Area [BSA], $\\ge 19 \\text{ mm/m}^2$)\n2.  Parasternal Short-Axis (PSAX) RVOT $\\ge 36 \\text{ mm}$ (or indexed to BSA, $\\ge 21 \\text{ mm/m}^2$)\n3.  Fractional Area Change (FAC) $\\le 33\\%$\n\nA **minor criterion** is met if there is:\nRegional RV akinesia or dyskinesia\n**AND** one of the following:\n1.  PLAX RVOT between $29 \\text{ mm}$ and $31 \\text{ mm}$ (or indexed, $16-18 \\text{ mm/m}^2$)\n2.  PSAX RVOT between $32 \\text{ mm}$ and $35 \\text{ mm}$ (or indexed, $19-20 \\text{ mm/m}^2$)\n3.  FAC between $34\\%$ and $40\\%$\n\nNow, we will systematically analyze the data provided in the problem statement against these criteria.\nThe given findings are:\n1.  Qualitative finding: Regional right ventricular akinesia on the free wall. This is a regional wall motion abnormality (RWMA) that is a prerequisite for both major and minor criteria.\n2.  Quantitative finding 1: PLAX RVOT diameter = $33 \\text{ mm}$.\n3.  Quantitative finding 2: PSAX RVOT diameter = $37 \\text{ mm}$.\n4.  Quantitative finding 3: RV FAC = $31\\%$.\n\nWe compare each quantitative finding to the established thresholds for a major criterion:\n- For the PLAX RVOT diameter: The measured value is $33 \\text{ mm}$. The threshold for a major criterion is $\\ge 32 \\text{ mm}$. Since $33 \\text{ mm} \\ge 32 \\text{ mm}$, this measurement meets the quantitative component of a major criterion.\n- For the PSAX RVOT diameter: The measured value is $37 \\text{ mm}$. The threshold for a major criterion is $\\ge 36 \\text{ mm}$. Since $37 \\text{ mm} \\ge 36 \\text{ mm}$, this measurement also meets the quantitative component of a major criterion.\n- For the RV FAC: The measured value is $31\\%$. The threshold for a major criterion is $\\le 33\\%$. Since $31\\% \\le 33\\%$, this measurement also meets the quantitative component of a major criterion.\n\nThe diagnostic framework requires the presence of a regional wall motion abnormality (akinesia, in this case) combined with **at least one** of the quantitative abnormalities to satisfy a major criterion. In this patient, we have regional akinesia plus three separate findings (PLAX RVOT dimension, PSAX RVOT dimension, and FAC) that each independently satisfy the quantitative part of a major criterion. Therefore, the patient's echocardiogram unequivocally meets a major criterion for ARVC.\n\nHaving established this conclusion, we now evaluate each option.\n\n**A. Meets a major echocardiographic criterion for ARVC**\nThis statement is consistent with our derivation. The presence of regional RV akinesia plus a PLAX RVOT of $33 \\text{ mm}$ (which is $\\ge 32 \\text{ mm}$) is sufficient on its own to meet a major criterion. The other abnormal measurements (PSAX RVOT and FAC) further corroborate this, but only one is required.\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\n**B. Meets only a minor echocardiographic criterion for ARVC**\nThis is incorrect. The patient's quantitative measurements ($33 \\text{ mm}$ PLAX, $37 \\text{ mm}$ PSAX, and $31\\%$ FAC) all fall outside the specified ranges for minor criteria ($29-31 \\text{ mm}$, $32-35 \\text{ mm}$, and $34-40\\%$, respectively) and squarely into the major criterion category.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**C. Does not meet echocardiographic criteria for ARVC**\nThis is incorrect. As demonstrated above, the findings clearly satisfy the definition of a major criterion based on the 2010 Task Force guidelines.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. Meets a major echocardiographic criterion only if dimensions are indexed to body surface area, because absolute measurements are insufficient**\nThis is a misinterpretation of the guidelines. The criteria explicitly provide two pathways for qualification: absolute dimensions **OR** dimensions indexed to BSA. The word \"or\" indicates that either method is sufficient. In this case, the absolute measurements ($33 \\text{ mm}$ and $37 \\text{ mm}$) are sufficient on their own, making indexing unnecessary for meeting the criterion.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**E. Meets a major echocardiographic criterion only if both RVOT diameters and FAC are simultaneously abnormal; otherwise it is minor**\nThis is also a misinterpretation of the guidelines. The criteria require a regional wall motion abnormality **AND** (logical OR) one of the listed quantitative abnormalities. The use of \"one of the following\" in the guidelines signifies that only one of the list items (abnormal PLAX, abnormal PSAX, or abnormal FAC) needs to be present. Requiring them to be simultaneously abnormal is not part of the established framework.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\nIn conclusion, the patient's echocardiographic findings satisfy a major criterion for ARVC diagnosis.",
