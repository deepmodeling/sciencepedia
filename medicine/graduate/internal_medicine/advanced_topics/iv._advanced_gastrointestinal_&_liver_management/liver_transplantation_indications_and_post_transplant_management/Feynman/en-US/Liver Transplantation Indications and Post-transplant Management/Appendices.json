The MELD-Na score is the standard for liver allocation in the United States and many other regions. The use of an exponential survival model (constant hazard) is a standard, albeit simplified, approach in survival analysis for modeling risk over a short-term horizon. The provided survival probabilities are clinically plausible for the given MELD-Na scores and for post-transplant outcomes.\n- **Well-Posed**: The problem is well-posed. It presents two distinct, mutually exclusive choices (transplant Candidate $A$ or transplant Candidate $B$) and a clear, quantifiable objective function (minimize total expected deaths). All necessary parameters are provided to calculate the value of the objective function for each choice, allowing for a unique optimal decision to be determined.\n- **Objective**: The problem is stated in precise, objective language. It relies on mathematical models and specified data, free from subjective or ambiguous terminology.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem statement is valid. It is scientifically sound, well-posed, and objective. The analysis will proceed to a solution.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe objective is to minimize the total expected number of deaths in the two-person cohort over a $90$-day period. For a single individual, the expected number of deaths is equal to their probability of death, since death is a binary outcome (value $1$) and survival is the complementary outcome (value $0$). The total expected number of deaths is the sum of the individual probabilities of death.\n\nLet $P_A$, $P_B$, and $P_{\\text{PT}}$ be the probabilities of death over $90$ days for Candidate $A$ on the waitlist, Candidate $B$ on the waitlist, and a candidate after transplant, respectively.\n\nUsing the provided survival data and principle (i), we calculate these probabilities:\n- Probability of death for Candidate $A$ on waitlist:\n$$P_A = 1 - S_A(90) = 1 - 0.50 = 0.50$$\n- Probability of death for Candidate $B$ on waitlist:\n$$P_B = 1 - S_B(90) = 1 - 0.81 = 0.19$$\n- Probability of death post-transplant (for either candidate):\n$$P_{\\text{PT}} = 1 - S_{\\text{PT}}(90) = 1 - 0.90 = 0.10$$\n\nNow, we evaluate the two allocation scenarios based on the objective function.\n\n**Scenario 1: Transplant Candidate $A$**\n- Candidate $A$ receives the liver. Their probability of death is $P_{\\text{PT}} = 0.10$.\n- Candidate $B$ remains on the waitlist. Their probability of death is $P_B = 0.19$.\n- The total expected number of deaths for this scenario, $E_1$, is:\n$$E_1 = P_{\\text{PT}} + P_B = 0.10 + 0.19 = 0.29$$\n\n**Scenario 2: Transplant Candidate $B$**\n- Candidate $B$ receives the liver. Their probability of death is $P_{\\text{PT}} = 0.10$.\n- Candidate $A$ remains on the waitlist. Their probability of death is $P_A = 0.50$.\n- The total expected number of deaths for this scenario, $E_2$, is:\n$$E_2 = P_A + P_{\\text{PT}} = 0.50 + 0.10 = 0.60$$\n\n**Comparison and Decision**\nTo minimize the expected number of deaths, we compare $E_1$ and $E_2$:\n$$E_1 = 0.29$$\n$$E_2 = 0.60$$\nSince $E_1 < E_2$, the allocation choice that minimizes the expected number of deaths is to transplant Candidate $A$.\n\nThis decision is equivalent to replacing the larger waitlist mortality risk ($P_A = 0.50$) with the smaller post-transplant mortality risk ($P_{\\text{PT}} = 0.10$), rather than replacing the smaller waitlist mortality risk ($P_B = 0.19$) with the post-transplant risk. The net reduction in the cohort's overall death probability is maximized by allocating the organ to the candidate with the highest waitlist mortality risk.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. Transplant Candidate $A$ (MELD-Na $30$) now, because replacing the larger waitlist $90$-day mortality curve with the smaller post-transplant $90$-day mortality curve minimizes the sum of expected deaths across both candidates.**\n- **Analysis:** This statement is fully consistent with the derivation. The calculated optimal strategy is to transplant Candidate $A$. The reasoning provided is precise: the sum of deaths is minimized by applying the transplant (which has a mortality probability $M_{\\text{PT}}(90) = 0.10$) to the candidate with the higher waitlist mortality ($M_A(90)=1-S_A(90)=0.50$), thereby substituting the largest mortality risk in the system with a much smaller one.\n- **Verdict:** Correct.\n\n**B. Transplant Candidate $B$ (MELD-Na $24$) now, because higher pre-transplant risk in Candidate $A$ implies higher post-transplant risk and worse overall $90$-day survival if transplanted.**\n- **Analysis:** This statement makes an assumption that is explicitly contradicted by the problem statement. The problem specifies that both candidates have a comparable post-transplant survival of $S_{\\text{PT}}(90) = 0.90$. Therefore, the premise that Candidate $A$ would have a worse post-transplant outcome is factually incorrect within the context of the problem.\n- **Verdict:** Incorrect.\n\n**C. Either candidate can be transplanted now with equivalent impact on $90$-day deaths, because their post-transplant $90$-day mortality curves are comparable.**\n- **Analysis:** This statement is incorrect. It ignores the mortality risk of the candidate who remains on the waitlist. While the post-transplant outcome is the same regardless of who receives the organ, the outcome for the non-transplanted candidate is vastly different depending on whether it is Candidate $A$ (high risk) or Candidate $B$ (lower risk). As calculated, the total expected deaths are not equivalent ($0.29$ vs. $0.60$).\n- **Verdict:** Incorrect.\n\n**D. Defer transplantation for both candidates to gather more data, because any nonzero post-transplant $90$-day mortality negates the short-horizon benefit of urgent transplantation.**\n- **Analysis:** This statement is incorrect. If transplantation is deferred, both candidates remain on the waitlist. The total expected number of deaths would be $P_A + P_B = 0.50 + 0.19 = 0.69$. This is the highest expected death toll among all considered options. The reasoning that any nonzero post-transplant mortality negates the benefit is also flawed; the benefit is the *reduction* in mortality compared to remaining on the waitlist. For Candidate $A$, this reduction is substantial ($0.50 \\to 0.10$).\n- **Verdict:** Incorrect.",

The operative plan aims to avoid Small-for-Size Syndrome (SFSS), which is known to occur in adults when the graft-to-recipient weight ratio is below a threshold corresponding to $0.8\\%$, that is, below the decimal $0.008$. The following data are obtained immediately preoperatively and on the back table:\n\n- The recipient’s standing body weight is $68.0$ kilograms, measured in the setting of tense ascites.\n- Immediately prior to hepatectomy, the entire ascites volume is drained and measured as $9.3$ liters.

There are no contradictions.\n- **Realism**: The patient data (weight, ascites volume) and graft mass are within a realistic range for this clinical scenario.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is deemed **valid** as it is scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, complete, consistent, and realistic. I will now proceed with the detailed solution.\n\nThe problem requires the computation of the graft-to-recipient weight ratio (GRWR) and an associated indicator variable, $S$. The calculation will proceed in several steps: first, determining the mass of the drained ascites; second, calculating the recipient's \"dry weight\"; third, computing the GRWR; and finally, determining the value of $S$.\n\nFirst, we calculate the mass of the drained ascites, $M_{\\text{ascites}}$. The volume is given as $V_{\\text{ascites}} = 9.3$ liters. The density is given as $\\rho_{\\text{ascites}} = 1$ g/mL. We must ensure consistent units. We convert the volume from liters (L) to milliliters (mL) using the conversion factor $1$ L $= 1000$ mL.\n$$V_{\\text{ascites}} = 9.3 \\, \\text{L} \\times \\frac{1000 \\, \\text{mL}}{1 \\, \\text{L}} = 9300 \\, \\text{mL}$$\nThe mass is the product of density and volume:\n$$M_{\\text{ascites}} = \\rho_{\\text{ascites}} \\times V_{\\text{ascites}} = \\left(1 \\, \\frac{\\text{g}}{\\text{mL}}\\right) \\times (9300 \\, \\text{mL}) = 9300 \\, \\text{g}$$\nTo subtract this from the recipient's body weight, which is given in kilograms (kg), we convert the ascites mass to kilograms using the conversion factor $1$ kg $= 1000$ g.\n$$M_{\\text{ascites}} = 9300 \\, \\text{g} \\times \\frac{1 \\, \\text{kg}}{1000 \\, \\text{g}} = 9.3 \\, \\text{kg}$$\n\nNext, we calculate the recipient's dry weight, $W_{\\text{dry}}$, by subtracting the mass of the drained ascites from the initial (wet) body weight, $W_{\\text{wet}} = 68.0$ kg.\n$$W_{\\text{dry}} = W_{\\text{wet}} - M_{\\text{ascites}} = 68.0 \\, \\text{kg} - 9.3 \\, \\text{kg} = 58.7 \\, \\text{kg}$$\n\nNow, we compute the graft-to-recipient weight ratio, denoted as $R$. The ratio is defined as the graft mass divided by the recipient's dry weight. The graft mass is given as $M_{\\text{graft}} = 455$ g. We convert this to kilograms for consistency.\n$$M_{\\text{graft}} = 455 \\, \\text{g} \\times \\frac{1 \\, \\text{kg}}{1000 \\, \\text{g}} = 0.455 \\, \\text{kg}$$\nThe ratio $R$ is a unitless quantity:\n$$R = \\frac{M_{\\text{graft}}}{W_{\\text{dry}}} = \\frac{0.455 \\, \\text{kg}}{58.7 \\, \\text{kg}} = \\frac{0.455}{58.7}$$\nPerforming the division gives the exact value of the ratio:\n$$R \\approx 0.00775127768313...$$\n\nThe problem requires this ratio to be reported rounded to four significant figures. The first significant figure is the first non-zero digit, which is the $7$ in the thousandths place. The first four significant figures are $7, 7, 5, 1$. The fifth significant figure is $2$. Since $2 < 5$, we round down (truncate).\n$$R_{\\text{rounded}} = 0.007751$$\n\nFinally, we determine the indicator variable $S$. The value of $S$ is decided based on the **unrounded** computed ratio, $R$. The condition is: $S=1$ if $R < 0.008$, and $S=0$ otherwise. We compare our computed ratio to the threshold:\n$$R = \\frac{0.455}{58.7} \\approx 0.007751...$$\nIs $0.007751... < 0.008$? Yes, this inequality holds true. Therefore, the indicator variable $S$ is assigned the value $1$.\n$$S = 1$$\n\nThe final answer is to be presented as a row matrix containing the rounded ratio and the value of $S$, in the form $(R_{\\text{rounded}}, S)$.

The patient's history, laboratory values, medications, and clinical presentation are all realistic and consistent with situations encountered in transplant hepatology. The concept of Early Allograft Dysfunction (EAD) is a standard, validated tool for risk stratification. The laboratory values are medically plausible for the described clinical state.\n2.  **Well-Posed:** The problem is well-posed. It provides a discrete clinical scenario and a clear question regarding diagnosis (of EAD) and management, which can be answered by applying established medical principles and diagnostic algorithms.\n3.  **Objective:** The problem is stated in objective, clinical language, free of subjective or biased terms. All information consists of verifiable data points.\n4.  **Completeness and Consistency:** The problem provides sufficient information to apply the EAD criteria and to reason through the differential diagnosis and management plan. The lack of POD $7$ imaging is a pertinent clinical detail, not an omission that invalidates the problem. The data are internally consistent; for instance, the patient's hemodynamic stability and clear sensorium contrast with the biochemical graft dysfunction, presenting a common and important clinical challenge.\n5.  **Other Flaws:** The problem is not unrealistic, ill-posed, trivial, or unverifiable.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem statement is **valid** as it is scientifically sound, well-posed, and objective. A solution will be derived.\n\n### Derivation of Solution\nThe first step is to determine if the patient meets the criteria for Early Allograft Dysfunction (EAD). A widely-used definition for EAD (Olthoff et al., Liver Transplantation, 2010) is the presence of one or more of the following by POD $7$:\n1.  Total bilirubin $\\geq 10$ mg/dL\n2.  INR $\\geq 1.6$\n3.  AST or ALT $> 2000$ U/L\n\nLet's apply the patient's POD $7$ laboratory values to these criteria:\n1.  The patient's total bilirubin is $12.0$ mg/dL. Since $12.0 \\ge 10$, this criterion **is met**.\n2.  The patient's INR is $1.5$. Since $1.5 < 1.6$, this criterion is not met.\n3.  The patient's AST is $220$ U/L and ALT is $210$ U/L. Since both are $< 2000$ U/L, this criterion is not met.\n\nAs the definition requires only one criterion to be fulfilled, and the patient's bilirubin level meets the threshold, the patient **does have Early Allograft Dysfunction (EAD)**.\n\nThe second step is to determine the appropriate management. EAD is a sign of graft injury, not a specific diagnosis. Its presence mandates an urgent and systematic evaluation to identify the underlying cause. The differential diagnosis for EAD includes, but is not limited to:\n- **Technical/Vascular Complications:** Hepatic artery thrombosis (HAT), portal vein thrombosis (PVT), or hepatic venous outflow obstruction. These are surgical emergencies that must be ruled out promptly.\n- **Biliary Complications:** Anastomotic stricture or leak, leading to cholestasis.\n- **Acute Cellular Rejection (ACR):** An immune-mediated attack on the allograft.\n- **Preservation Injury:** Ischemia-reperfusion injury, which is usually maximal in the first few days and then improves.\n- **Drug-Induced Liver Injury:** Including toxicity from immunosuppressants like tacrolimus.\n- **Primary Nonfunction (PNF):** A catastrophic, immediate failure of the graft. This is ruled out in this patient, who is hemodynamically stable and alert on POD $7$.\n\nThe management strategy should prioritize ruling out the most urgent and treatable causes.\n1.  **Hemodynamic and Supportive Care:** Ensure adequate graft perfusion by maintaining normotension and euvolemia. Avoid nephrotoxic agents, as renal dysfunction often accompanies liver dysfunction.\n2.  **Rule out Vascular Complications:** The highest priority is to exclude HAT and other vascular issues. The standard, first-line, non-invasive imaging modality is an urgent Doppler ultrasound of the liver allograft. The POD $1$ scan is reassuring but does not rule out a subsequent event.\n3.  **Evaluate for Biliary Complications:** The cholestatic pattern (high bilirubin, GGT, and alkaline phosphatase) warrants evaluation of the biliary tree. The Doppler ultrasound is a first step, and may be followed by MRCP or ERCP if indicated.\n4.  **Review Medications:** The tacrolimus level of $7.5$ ng/mL is within the typical therapeutic range for this early post-transplant period (e.g., $5-10$ ng/mL). It does not suggest overt toxicity, but the entire medication list should be reviewed.\n5.  **Consider Liver Biopsy:** If vascular and biliary etiologies are excluded, and dysfunction persists, a liver biopsy is the gold standard for diagnosing ACR or other parenchymal diseases. It is not a first-line step before non-invasive imaging.\n6.  **Re-transplantation:** This is a final option for irreversible graft failure, not an initial step for a stable patient with EAD.\n\nBased on this systematic approach, the best course of action is to acknowledge EAD and initiate a prompt, multi-faceted investigation, starting with an urgent Doppler ultrasound, while providing supportive care.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n**A. He does not meet Early Allograft Dysfunction because the International Normalized Ratio is less than $1.6$; no further workup is indicated, and calcineurin inhibitor should be increased aggressively to target trough $>12$ ng/mL.**\nThis statement is incorrect. The patient meets EAD criteria due to bilirubin $\\geq 10$ mg/dL. The criteria are disjunctive (i.e., \"or\"). Stating that no further workup is needed is inappropriate and dangerous. Aggressively increasing the CNI in the setting of graft dysfunction is also contraindicated and could worsen cholestasis or cause nephrotoxicity.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**B. He meets Early Allograft Dysfunction and should be urgently listed for retransplantation for primary nonfunction given bilirubin $>10$ mg/dL on postoperative day $7$.**\nThis statement correctly identifies EAD but draws the wrong conclusion. The patient's clinical stability (normotensive, alert, good urine output) is inconsistent with primary nonfunction (PNF), which is a diagnosis of immediate, catastrophic graft failure. EAD is an indication for workup, not immediate listing for retransplantation in a stable patient.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**C. He meets Early Allograft Dysfunction; initiate supportive optimization and targeted evaluation, including urgent Doppler ultrasound of the hepatic artery, portal vein, and hepatic veins to assess patency and resistive indices; assess the biliary tree for obstruction or leak; review drug exposures and tacrolimus level; maintain perfusion and avoid nephrotoxins; and consider liver biopsy if cholestasis or enzyme abnormalities persist despite correction of reversible causes.**\nThis statement correctly identifies EAD and outlines a comprehensive, logical, and evidence-based management plan. It correctly prioritizes a workup for reversible and urgent causes (vascular, biliary) with Doppler ultrasound, emphasizes supportive care, and appropriately places liver biopsy as a subsequent diagnostic step. This is the standard of care.\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\n**D. He meets Early Allograft Dysfunction only if both bilirubin on postoperative day $7$ is $\\geq 10$ mg/dL and International Normalized Ratio is $\\geq 1.6$; because International Normalized Ratio is $1.5$, he does not meet Early Allograft Dysfunction and can be reassured and discharged.**\nThis statement uses an incorrect, conjunctive (\"and\") definition of EAD. The standard definition is disjunctive (\"or\"). Therefore, the patient does meet EAD criteria. Reassurance and discharge would constitute gross medical negligence.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**E. He meets Early Allograft Dysfunction; initiate high-dose corticosteroids immediately for presumed acute cellular rejection without further diagnostic testing.**\nThis statement correctly identifies EAD but proposes an inappropriate next step. Empirically treating for acute cellular rejection with high-dose steroids without first ruling out vascular and biliary complications is not standard practice. These technical complications require specific interventions, and giving steroids could delay correct diagnosis and treatment, while also increasing the risk of infection. A diagnosis of rejection is best confirmed by biopsy.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**",
