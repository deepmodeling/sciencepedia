The clinical context, including the specific disease (anti-synthetase syndrome), antibody test (anti-Jo-1), and associated clinical features, is factually correct. The provided definitions of sensitivity, specificity, and prevalence are standard in biostatistics and epidemiology. The numerical values ($Se = 0.68$, $Sp = 0.96$, $\\pi = 0.18$) are plausible for a highly specific test applied to a specialized, high-risk referral population, where the pre-test probability ($\\pi$) is expected to be substantially higher than in the general population. The problem is well-posed, providing all necessary data for the derivations and calculations. The language is objective and unambiguous. The problem does not violate any of the specified criteria for invalidity.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. A complete solution will be provided.\n\n**Derivation and Calculation**\n\nLet $D$ be the event that a patient has anti-synthetase syndrome, and $\\overline{D}$ be the event that the patient does not. Let $T^{+}$ be the event of a positive anti-Jo-1 test result, and $T^{-}$ be the event of a negative result.\n\nThe provided parameters are:\n- Prevalence: $\\pi = \\mathbb{P}(D) = 0.18$\n- Sensitivity: $Se = \\mathbb{P}(T^{+}\\mid D) = 0.68$\n- Specificity: $Sp = \\mathbb{P}(T^{-}\\mid \\overline{D}) = 0.96$\n\nFrom these, we can derive the probabilities of the complementary events:\n- The probability of not having the disease is $\\mathbb{P}(\\overline{D}) = 1 - \\mathbb{P}(D) = 1 - \\pi = 1 - 0.18 = 0.82$.\n- The probability of a negative test given the disease (false negative rate) is $\\mathbb{P}(T^{-}\\mid D) = 1 - \\mathbb{P}(T^{+}\\mid D) = 1 - Se = 1 - 0.68 = 0.32$.\n- The probability of a positive test given no disease (false positive rate) is $\\mathbb{P}(T^{+}\\mid \\overline{D}) = 1 - \\mathbb{P}(T^{-}\\mid \\overline{D}) = 1 - Sp = 1 - 0.96 = 0.04$.\n\n**1. Positive Predictive Value (PPV), $\\mathbb{P}(D\\mid T^{+})$**\n\nThe positive predictive value is the probability that a patient with a positive test result actually has the disease. We begin with the definition of conditional probability, which leads to Bayes' theorem:\n$$ \\mathbb{P}(D\\mid T^{+}) = \\frac{\\mathbb{P}(D \\cap T^{+})}{\\mathbb{P}(T^{+})} = \\frac{\\mathbb{P}(T^{+}\\mid D)\\mathbb{P}(D)}{\\mathbb{P}(T^{+})} $$\nThe denominator, $\\mathbb{P}(T^{+})$, is the total probability of a positive test. It can be expanded using the law of total probability by conditioning on the disease status, $D$ and $\\overline{D}$:\n$$ \\mathbb{P}(T^{+}) = \\mathbb{P}(T^{+} \\mid D)\\mathbb{P}(D) + \\mathbb{P}(T^{+} \\mid \\overline{D})\\mathbb{P}(\\overline{D}) $$\nSubstituting the given parameters and derived values:\n$$ \\mathbb{P}(T^{+}) = (Se)(\\pi) + (1-Sp)(1-\\pi) $$\nNow, we substitute this expansion back into the expression for PPV, yielding the general formula derived from first principles:\n$$ \\text{PPV} = \\mathbb{P}(D\\mid T^{+}) = \\frac{Se \\cdot \\pi}{Se \\cdot \\pi + (1-Sp)(1-\\pi)} $$\nWe now compute the numerical value:\n$$ \\mathbb{P}(D\\mid T^{+}) = \\frac{(0.68)(0.18)}{(0.68)(0.18) + (1-0.96)(1-0.18)} $$\n$$ \\mathbb{P}(D\\mid T^{+}) = \\frac{0.1224}{0.1224 + (0.04)(0.82)} $$\n$$ \\mathbb{P}(D\\mid T^{+}) = \\frac{0.1224}{0.1224 + 0.0328} $$\n$$ \\mathbb{P}(D\\mid T^{+}) = \\frac{0.1224}{0.1552} \\approx 0.788660438... $$\nRounding to four significant figures, the positive predictive value is $0.7887$.\n\n**2. Negative Predictive Value (NPV), $\\mathbb{P}(\\overline{D}\\mid T^{-})$**\n\nThe negative predictive value is the probability that a patient with a negative test result is truly free of the disease. We again start from Bayes' theorem:\n$$ \\mathbb{P}(\\overline{D}\\mid T^{-}) = \\frac{\\mathbb{P}(\\overline{D} \\cap T^{-})}{\\mathbb{P}(T^{-})} = \\frac{\\mathbb{P}(T^{-}\\mid \\overline{D})\\mathbb{P}(\\overline{D})}{\\mathbb{P}(T^{-})} $$\nThe denominator, $\\mathbb{P}(T^{-})$, is the total probability of a negative test. We expand it using the law of total probability:\n$$ \\mathbb{P}(T^{-}) = \\mathbb{P}(T^{-} \\mid \\overline{D})\\mathbb{P}(\\overline{D}) + \\mathbb{P}(T^{-} \\mid D)\\mathbb{P}(D) $$\nSubstituting the parameters:\n$$ \\mathbb{P}(T^{-}) = (Sp)(1-\\pi) + (1-Se)(\\pi) $$\nSubstituting this back into the expression for NPV provides the general formula:\n$$ \\text{NPV} = \\mathbb{P}(\\overline{D}\\mid T^{-}) = \\frac{Sp \\cdot (1-\\pi)}{Sp \\cdot (1-\\pi) + (1-Se) \\cdot \\pi} $$\nWe now compute the numerical value:\n$$ \\mathbb{P}(\\overline{D}\\mid T^{-}) = \\frac{(0.96)(1-0.18)}{(0.96)(1-0.18) + (1-0.68)(0.18)} $$\n$$ \\mathbb{P}(\\overline{D}\\mid T^{-}) = \\frac{(0.96)(0.82)}{(0.96)(0.82) + (0.32)(0.18)} $$\n$$ \\mathbb{P}(\\overline{D}\\mid T^{-}) = \\frac{0.7872}{0.7872 + 0.0576} $$\n$$ \\mathbb{P}(\\overline{D}\\mid T^{-}) = \\frac{0.7872}{0.8448} \\approx 0.931818181... $$\nRounding to four significant figures, the negative predictive value is $0.9318$.\n\nThe final computed values are $\\text{PPV} \\approx 0.7887$ and $\\text{NPV} \\approx 0.9318$.",

            "problem": "A patient with anti-synthetase syndrome characterized by anti-histidyl transfer ribonucleic acid (tRNA) synthetase antibody (anti-Jo-1) positivity and biopsy-proven immune-mediated inflammatory myopathy was started on high-dose oral glucocorticoids for active myositis and is now undergoing a taper. The clinician must determine whether new proximal weakness reflects a flare of inflammatory myopathy or glucocorticoid-induced myopathy. Use the following foundational facts and definitions to reason from first principles.\n\nCreatine kinase (CK) is a cytosolic enzyme released into the bloodstream when skeletal muscle fibers undergo necrosis or substantial sarcolemmal membrane injury; therefore, sustained elevation and an upward trend in serum CK indicate ongoing myofiber injury, whereas normalization or continued decline suggests reduced necrosis. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) Short Tau Inversion Recovery (STIR) sequences detect increased free water content in tissues and are sensitive to muscle edema from active inflammation; thus, new or worsening STIR hyperintensity implies active myositis, while resolution of STIR hyperintensity argues against ongoing inflammatory edema. Systemic glucocorticoids can cause a toxic myopathy characterized by type II fiber atrophy without true myofiber necrosis; in such cases, CK is usually normal or falling, and MRI STIR shows no inflammatory edema, even though clinical strength may worsen. Proximal weakness (for example, hip flexors and shoulder abductors) is common to both active inflammatory myopathy and glucocorticoid-induced myopathy; differentiating relies on integrating serum CK trends, MRI edema findings, and the trajectory of clinical strength.\n\nA $48$-year-old woman with anti-synthetase syndrome began prednisone at $1\\,\\mathrm{mg/kg/day}$ $8$ weeks ago when her CK was $9{,}600$ $\\mathrm{U/L}$ and MRI STIR showed diffuse thigh muscle edema. Over $4$ weeks of high-dose therapy, CK fell to $3{,}000$ $\\mathrm{U/L}$ and strength improved. She is now tapering by $5$ $\\mathrm{mg}$ every $1$ to $2$ weeks. Over the past $2$ weeks, she reports new difficulty rising from a chair. Current exam shows proximal hip flexor strength by Medical Research Council (MRC) grading of $4-/5$ bilaterally without notable myalgia. Consider four possible integrated data trajectories collected contemporaneously (serum CK trend over time $t$, MRI STIR edema in proximal thigh muscles, and change in proximal strength):\n\nA. CK continues to decline from $2{,}400$ $\\mathrm{U/L}$ to $1{,}000$ $\\mathrm{U/L}$ over the past $2$ weeks ($d(\\mathrm{CK})/dt<0$), MRI STIR shows resolution of prior edema with residual fatty replacement on T1-weighted images, and proximal hip flexor strength has worsened from $5/5$ to $4-/5$ without myalgia.\n\nB. CK rises from $1{,}000$ $\\mathrm{U/L}$ to $3{,}800$ $\\mathrm{U/L}$ over the past $2$ weeks ($d(\\mathrm{CK})/dt>0$), MRI STIR shows new diffuse hyperintensity in quadriceps and hamstrings, and proximal hip flexor strength declines from $4+/5$ to $4-/5$ with increased myalgia.\n\nC. CK is stable near normal from $160$ $\\mathrm{U/L}$ to $180$ $\\mathrm{U/L}$ over the past $2$ weeks, MRI STIR shows new focal hyperintensity limited to the right adductor muscle consistent with a strain, and proximal hip flexor strength remains $4+/5$ bilaterally.\n\nD. CK declines from $1{,}400$ $\\mathrm{U/L}$ to $900$ $\\mathrm{U/L}$ ($d(\\mathrm{CK})/dt<0$), MRI STIR shows persistent diffuse edema in proximal thigh muscles similar to prior scans, and proximal hip flexor strength worsens from $4/5$ to $3+/5$ with new myalgia.\n\nWhich option most strongly supports glucocorticoid-induced myopathy rather than an active inflammatory myopathy flare during the taper, based on the integration of CK trends, MRI edema, and clinical strength changes?\n\nChoose one best answer.",
            "solution": "The problem statement will first be validated for scientific soundness, logical consistency, and objectivity.\n\n**Step 1: Extract Givens**\n\n*   **Diagnosis:** Anti-synthetase syndrome with anti-histidyl transfer ribonucleic acid (tRNA) synthetase antibody (anti-Jo-1) positivity and biopsy-proven immune-mediated inflammatory myopathy (IMIM).\n*   **Clinical Situation:** The patient is on a tapering dose of oral glucocorticoids after initial treatment for active myositis and is now experiencing new proximal weakness. The differential diagnosis is a flare of inflammatory myopathy versus glucocorticoid-induced myopathy.\n*   **Foundational Principles:**\n    1.  **Creatine Kinase (CK):** A marker of myofiber necrosis or sarcolemmal injury.\n        *   Sustained elevation or an upward trend ($d(\\mathrm{CK})/dt > 0$) implies ongoing myofiber injury (active myositis).\n        *   Normalization or continued decline ($d(\\mathrm{CK})/dt \\le 0$) implies reduced necrosis.\n    2.  **Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) Short Tau Inversion Recovery (STIR) Sequence:** A marker of muscle edema from active inflammation.\n        *   New or worsening STIR hyperintensity implies active myositis.\n        *   Resolution of STIR hyperintensity argues against ongoing inflammatory edema.\n    3.  **Glucocorticoid-induced Myopathy (GIM):** A toxic myopathy with type II fiber atrophy without true myofiber necrosis.\n        *   Characterized by normal or falling CK levels.\n        *   Characterized by the absence of inflammatory edema on MRI STIR.\n        *   Presents with clinical weakness.\n    4.  **Differential Diagnosis:** Both active IMIM and GIM cause proximal weakness.

The descriptions of anti-synthetase syndrome, the mechanisms of inflammatory versus steroid-induced myopathy, and the use of CK and MRI STIR as diagnostic tools are all factually and scientifically accurate.\n2.  **Well-Posed:** The problem is well-posed. It establishes a clear set of logical rules for differentiating two conditions and then presents four scenarios to which these rules must be applied. The question asks for the scenario that \"most strongly supports\" one diagnosis, which implies a comparative analysis leading to a single best answer.\n3.  **Objective:** The problem is stated in precise, objective, clinical language. The use of quantitative data (CK levels, MRC grades) and standardized imaging descriptions (STIR hyperintensity) avoids subjectivity.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\n\nThe problem statement is valid. It is scientifically sound, well-posed, and objective. It presents a realistic and logically solvable clinical reasoning challenge. The solution will proceed by applying the provided foundational principles to each option.\n\n**Derivation of Solution**\n\nThe core task is to identify the scenario that best fits the predefined pattern of glucocorticoid-induced myopathy (GIM) while being inconsistent with the pattern of an inflammatory myopathy (IMIM) flare. Based on the provided principles:\n\n*   **IMIM Flare Signature:** Worsening weakness + a rising CK ($d(\\mathrm{CK})/dt > 0$) + new or worsening MRI STIR edema.\n*   **GIM Signature:** Worsening weakness + a normal or falling CK ($d(\\mathrm{CK})/dt \\le 0$) + no new or worsening MRI STIR edema (i.e., edema is resolved or absent).\n\nThe patient's presentation of new proximal weakness is the key clinical finding that must be explained by one of these two signatures. We will now evaluate each option against these established signatures.\n\n**Option-by-Option Analysis**\n\n**A. CK continues to decline from $2{,}400$ $\\mathrm{U/L}$ to $1{,}000$ $\\mathrm{U/L}$ over the past $2$ weeks ($d(\\mathrm{CK})/dt<0$), MRI STIR shows resolution of prior edema with residual fatty replacement on T1-weighted images, and proximal hip flexor strength has worsened from $5/5$ to $4-/5$ without myalgia.**\n\n*   **Analysis:** This scenario presents a classic triad for GIM. The clinical strength has worsened, fulfilling the initial condition. The CK level is declining ($d(\\mathrm{CK})/dt < 0$), which indicates a reduction in myofiber necrosis and argues against an IMIM flare. The MRI STIR shows resolution of edema, which indicates that active inflammation is not the cause of the new weakness. The combination of worsening strength in the absence of biochemical (rising CK) and imaging (edema) evidence of inflammation is the specific signature of GIM. The absence of myalgia is also more characteristic of GIM than an IMIM flare.\n*   **Verdict:** **Correct**. This option most strongly supports glucocorticoid-induced myopathy.\n\n**B. CK rises from $1{,}000$ $\\mathrm{U/L}$ to $3{,}800$ $\\mathrm{U/L}$ over the past $2$ weeks ($d(\\mathrm{CK})/dt>0$), MRI STIR shows new diffuse hyperintensity in quadriceps and hamstrings, and proximal hip flexor strength declines from $4+/5$ to $4-/5$ with increased myalgia.**\n\n*   **Analysis:** This scenario presents the classic triad for an IMIM flare. The clinical strength has worsened. The CK level is rising significantly ($d(\\mathrm{CK})/dt>0$), indicating new myofiber necrosis. The MRI STIR shows new diffuse hyperintensity, indicating active inflammation (myositis). The presence of increased myalgia further supports an inflammatory process. This pattern is the antithesis of GIM.\n*   **Verdict:** **Incorrect**. This option strongly supports an active inflammatory myopathy flare.\n\n**C. CK is stable near normal from $160$ $\\mathrm{U/L}$ to $180$ $\\mathrm{U/L}$ over the past $2$ weeks, MRI STIR shows new focal hyperintensity limited to the right adductor muscle consistent with a strain, and proximal hip flexor strength remains $4+/5$ bilaterally.**\n\n*   **Analysis:** This scenario contradicts the central premise of the problem, which is to explain *new proximal weakness*. In this option, the proximal hip flexor strength *remains stable*. The new imaging finding is focal and attributed to a muscle strain, not a diffuse myopathic process. While the CK is stable and near-normal (a feature that could be seen in GIM), the absence of worsening weakness means this scenario does not represent the clinical problem of either GIM or an IMIM flare.\n*   **Verdict:** **Incorrect**. This option does not align with the patient's presenting complaint of new weakness.\n\n**D. CK declines from $1{,}400$ $\\mathrm{U/L}$ to $900$ $\\mathrm{U/L}$ ($d(\\mathrm{CK})/dt<0$), MRI STIR shows persistent diffuse edema in proximal thigh muscles similar to prior scans, and proximal hip flexor strength worsens from $4/5$ to $3+/5$ with new myalgia.**\n\n*   **Analysis:** This scenario presents a mixed and conflicting picture. The worsening strength and new myalgia are concerning for a flare. The *persistent diffuse edema* on MRI is strong evidence of ongoing, inadequately treated inflammatory myopathy. According to the problem's principles, GIM is characterized by the *absence* of inflammatory edema. Therefore, the persistent edema argues strongly against GIM as the sole or primary explanation. The declining CK is discordant with the imaging and clinical findings, but it does not override the powerful evidence of active inflammation from the MRI. This picture suggests refractory or undertreated IMIM, not GIM.\n*   **Verdict:** **Incorrect**. The presence of persistent diffuse inflammatory edema is fundamentally inconsistent with the definition of glucocorticoid-induced myopathy provided.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nBy systematically applying the foundational principles given in the problem statement, option A is the only scenario that perfectly aligns with the signature of glucocorticoid-induced myopathy: worsening clinical strength, a falling creatine kinase level, and resolution of inflammatory edema on MRI.",

Begin from the following fundamental base: inflammatory myopathies are characterized by immune-mediated injury to skeletal muscle fibers, each subtype having characteristic age at onset, tempo of progression, distribution of weakness, and histopathologic signatures that reflect the underlying pathophysiology. Polymyositis (PM) is classically a T cell–mediated endomysial process with myofiber necrosis and regeneration and typically responds to immunosuppression. Inclusion body myositis (IBM) combines endomysial cytotoxic T cell activity with degenerative changes marked by abnormal protein aggregation, culminating in distinctive structural inclusions.

It is a valid, solvable problem based on scientific principles.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. The solution process will now proceed.\n\n**Derivation of Distinguishing Criteria from First Principles**\n\nBased on the provided definitions, a set of expected features for each condition can be logically derived.\n\n**For Polymyositis (PM):**\n- **Pathophysiology:** Defined as a \"T cell–mediated endomysial process.\" This is a purely inflammatory mechanism.\n- **Histopathology:** The direct consequence is \"myofiber necrosis and regeneration.\" As an immune-mediated process targeting muscle fibers, upregulation of cell-surface markers like major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC I) on myofibers is a requisite step for cytotoxic T cell recognition and attack. The definition for IBM specifies \"distinctive structural inclusions,\" which, by logical contrast, implies their absence in classic PM.\n- **Clinical Features:** Inflammatory autoimmune processes, such as this, are typically subacute in onset (developing over weeks to months) and tend to produce symmetric weakness, classically affecting the large proximal muscle groups (pelvic and shoulder girdles). Autoimmunity can present at various ages but is common in younger to middle-aged adults.\n\n**For Inclusion Body Myositis (IBM):**\n- **Pathophysiology:** Defined by a dual mechanism: (1) \"endomysial cytotoxic T cell activity\" (inflammatory component similar to PM) and (2) \"degenerative changes marked by abnormal protein aggregation\" (degenerative component).\n- **Histopathology:** This dual pathology must be reflected in the biopsy. The inflammatory component is the endomysial T cell infiltrate. The degenerative component manifests as \"distinctive structural inclusions\" resulting from protein aggregation. In pathology, these are known as \"rimmed vacuoles,\" and the aggregated proteins are often congophilic (stain with Congo red).\n- **Clinical Features:** The presence of a degenerative component strongly suggests features associated with aging and slow decline.\n    - **Age at Onset:** Expected to be in older individuals, typically over the age of 50 years.\n    - **Progression Rate:** Degenerative processes are characteristically insidious, evolving slowly over many months to years.\n    - **Distribution of Weakness:** The unique combination of inflammation and degeneration often results in a distinct and frequently asymmetric pattern of weakness. The classic, albeit not explicitly derivable from the prompt's fundamentals alone, pattern involves both distal muscles (e.g., finger flexors) and specific proximal muscles (e.g., quadriceps/knee extensors), distinguishing it from the simple proximal pattern of PM.\n\n**Summary of Derived Differentiating Features:**\n| Feature | Inclusion Body Myositis (IBM) | Polymyositis (PM) |\n|---|---|---|\n| **Age at Onset** | Older adults (>50 years) | Younger to middle-aged adults |\n| **Progression Rate** | Insidious (years) | Subacute (months) |\n| **Weakness Pattern** | Asymmetric; distal (finger flexors) and proximal (quadriceps) | Symmetric; proximal girdle |\n| **Biopsy** | Inflammation + distinctive inclusions (rimmed vacuoles) | Inflammation with necrosis/regeneration; no inclusions |\n\n**Evaluation of Options**\n\nEach option will now be compared against this derived set of criteria.\n\n**A. IBM: age typically >50 years; insidious progression over several years; asymmetric weakness with early involvement of distal finger flexors and knee extensors (quadriceps); biopsy shows endomysial cytotoxic T cell invasion of non-necrotic fibers plus rimmed vacuoles with congophilic inclusions. PM: age often younger to middle-aged adults; subacute progression over months; symmetric proximal girdle weakness; biopsy shows endomysial inflammation with myofiber necrosis/regeneration and diffuse major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC I) upregulation without rimmed vacuoles.**\n- **IBM description:** The age (>50), progression (insidious), weakness pattern (asymmetric, finger flexors, quadriceps), and biopsy findings (inflammation plus rimmed vacuoles/inclusions) are all fully consistent with the derived model. The detail about T cell invasion of *non-necrotic* fibers is a known specific feature of IBM that fits the dual pathology model.\n- **PM description:** The age (younger), progression (subacute), weakness pattern (symmetric proximal), and biopsy findings (inflammation, necrosis, MHC I upregulation, and absence of vacuoles) are also fully consistent with the derived model.\n- **Verdict:** **Correct**. This option accurately operationalizes the fundamental principles into a valid set of distinguishing criteria.\n\n**B. IBM: any age including children; rapid progression over weeks; symmetric proximal weakness; biopsy shows perifascicular atrophy and capillary membrane attack complex deposition. PM: usually age >60 years; very slow progression over years; distal-predominant weakness; biopsy shows rimmed vacuoles and congophilic inclusions.**\n- **IBM description:** \"any age including children\" is incorrect. \"rapid progression\" is incorrect. \"symmetric proximal weakness\" is the pattern for PM, not IBM. The biopsy findings of \"perifascicular atrophy and membrane attack complex\" are characteristic of dermatomyositis, not IBM.\n- **PM description:** The features listed for PM (age >60, slow progression, rimmed vacuoles) are actually characteristic of IBM.\n- **Verdict:** **Incorrect**. This option swaps many features between IBM and PM and introduces features of a third disease, dermatomyositis.\n\n**C. IBM: middle age (30–40 years); subacute course over 6 months; symmetric distal finger extensor weakness; biopsy shows non-specific necrosis without inclusions. PM: elderly (often >70 years); gradual course over years; proximal weakness; biopsy shows rimmed vacuoles and congophilic inclusions.**\n- **IBM description:** The age (30–40 years) is incorrect. The course (subacute) is incorrect. The weakness pattern (finger *extensor*) is incorrect. Most critically, the biopsy description (\"without inclusions\") directly contradicts the fundamental definition of IBM provided in the problem.\n- **PM description:** The features listed for PM (elderly, gradual course, rimmed vacuoles) are characteristic of IBM.\n- **Verdict:** **Incorrect**. This option swaps key features and presents factually incorrect information that contradicts the problem's own definitions.\n\n**D. IBM: older age (>50 years); insidious course over years; symmetric proximal weakness without distal predilection; biopsy lacks inclusions and shows only endomysial inflammation. PM: any age; rapid progression over weeks to months; distal weakness involving finger flexors; biopsy shows congophilic inclusions and rimmed vacuoles.**\n- **IBM description:** While age and course are correct, the weakness pattern (\"without distal predilection\") is incorrect, and the biopsy finding (\"lacks inclusions\") fundamentally misrepresents IBM.\n- **PM description:** The weakness pattern (\"distal weakness involving finger flexors\") and biopsy findings (\"congophilic inclusions and rimmed vacuoles\") are hallmarks of IBM, not PM.\n- **Verdict:** **Incorrect**. This option swaps the pathognomonic biopsy features and mischaracterizes the weakness distribution for both conditions.",
