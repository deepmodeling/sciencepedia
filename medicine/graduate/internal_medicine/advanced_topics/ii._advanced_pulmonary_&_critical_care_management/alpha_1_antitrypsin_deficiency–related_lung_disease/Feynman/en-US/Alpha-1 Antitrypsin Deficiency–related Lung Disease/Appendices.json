            "problem": "A couple seeks counseling regarding their future children’s risk for alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency–related lung disease. One parent has protease inhibitor (Pi) phenotype PiZZ, and the other has PiMS. Alpha-1 antitrypsin (AAT) is encoded by the SERPINA1 gene with common alleles $M$, $S$, and $Z$. Assume Mendelian segregation with codominant expression: each child inherits one allele from each parent, with no segregation distortion, and alleles $M$ and $S$ are equally likely to be transmitted from the PiMS parent. The PiZZ parent transmits only allele $Z$.\n\nUse the following widely accepted typical steady-state serum AAT concentration fractions, expressed relative to the PiMM reference:\n- $\\mathrm{MM}: c_{\\mathrm{MM}} = 1.0$\n- $\\mathrm{MZ}: c_{\\mathrm{MZ}} \\approx 0.6$\n- $\\mathrm{MS}: c_{\\mathrm{MS}} \\approx 0.8$\n- $\\mathrm{SZ}: c_{\\mathrm{SZ}} \\approx 0.4$\n- $\\mathrm{ZZ}: c_{\\mathrm{ZZ}} \\approx 0.15$\n\nTasks:\n1. Derive the probability that a child has the $\\mathrm{MZ}$ phenotype and the probability that a child has the $\\mathrm{SZ}$ phenotype.\n2. Using the concentration fractions above, assign the predicted relative serum AAT concentration to each possible child phenotype.\n3. Finally, compute the expected mean relative serum AAT concentration across the offspring cohort as a decimal fraction of the PiMM reference.\n\nExpress the final expected mean relative concentration as a decimal fraction and round your answer to four significant figures. No physical units are required because the quantity is dimensionless by definition.",
            "solution": "The problem concerns inheritance of alpha-1 antitrypsin (AAT) alleles and the resulting protease inhibitor (Pi) phenotypes, which determine typical steady-state serum AAT concentrations. The foundational principles required are Mendelian segregation with codominant expression and the definition of expected value in probability.\n\nFirst, establish the allele transmission:\n- The $\\mathrm{PiZZ}$ parent is homozygous $Z/Z$, so that parent contributes allele $Z$ to every child with probability $1$.\n- The $\\mathrm{PiMS}$ parent is heterozygous $M/S$. Under Mendelian segregation without distortion, the gametes carry allele $M$ with probability $1/2$ and allele $S$ with probability $1/2$.\n\nTherefore, the possible child genotypes and their probabilities are:\n- $\\mathrm{MZ}$, formed by $M$ from the $\\mathrm{PiMS}$ parent and $Z$ from the $\\mathrm{PiZZ}$ parent, with probability\n$$\np_{\\mathrm{MZ}} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 1 = \\frac{1}{2}.\n$$\n- $\\mathrm{SZ}$, formed by $S$ from the $\\mathrm{PiMS}$ parent and $Z$ from the $\\mathrm{PiZZ}$ parent, with probability\n$$\np_{\\mathrm{SZ}} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 1 = \\frac{1}{2}.\n$$\n\nNo other child genotype is possible because the $\\mathrm{PiZZ}$ parent cannot contribute $M$ or $S$.\n\nSecond, assign the predicted relative serum AAT concentration for each phenotype using the provided typical fractions:\n- For $\\mathrm{MZ}$, the fraction is\n$$\nc_{\\mathrm{MZ}} \\approx 0.6.\n$$\n- For $\\mathrm{SZ}$, the fraction is\n$$\nc_{\\mathrm{SZ}} \\approx 0.4.\n$$\n\nThird, compute the expected mean relative serum AAT concentration across children. By the definition of expectation for a discrete distribution, the expected fraction $\\mathbb{E}[C]$ is the probability-weighted sum of the phenotype-specific fractions:\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}[C] = p_{\\mathrm{MZ}} \\, c_{\\mathrm{MZ}} + p_{\\mathrm{SZ}} \\, c_{\\mathrm{SZ}}.\n$$\nSubstitute the values:\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}[C] = \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) \\cdot 0.6 + \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) \\cdot 0.4 = \\frac{0.6 + 0.4}{2} = \\frac{1.0}{2} = 0.5.\n$$\n\nRounding $0.5$ to four significant figures yields $0.5000$.

The solution will be derived from the provided first principles: the definition of the partition coefficient and the definition of molarity.\n\nFirst, we use the definition of the ELF-to-serum partition coefficient, $K_{ELF:serum}$, which relates the concentration in the ELF, $C_{ELF}$, to the concentration in the serum, $C_{serum}$. The problem provides these concentrations in units of mass per volume. To avoid ambiguity, we will denote mass concentration with the symbol $\\rho$.\n$$\nK_{ELF:serum} = \\frac{\\rho_{ELF}}{\\rho_{serum}}\n$$\nWe are given $\\rho_{serum} = 60.0$ mg/dL and $K_{ELF:serum} = 0.10$.

This additional time is invaluable in the management of patients with severe AATD-related lung disease. The process of lung transplant evaluation, listing, and awaiting a suitable donor organ is fraught with uncertainty and can take several years, during which patients face a high risk of clinical deterioration and mortality. Gaining over a year and a half significantly extends the window of opportunity for a successful transplant. It allows more time for completion of the comprehensive transplant evaluation, for the patient to optimize their physical condition, and critically, to accrue time on the wait-list. This quantitative result powerfully underscores that smoking cessation is not merely an advisory measure but a cornerstone therapeutic intervention. By slowing the rate of lung function decline, it directly modifies the disease trajectory, tangibly deferring the need for end-stage therapies and improving the patient's prognosis.",
