            "problem": "A $68$-year-old man with known metastatic colorectal cancer presents with $2$ hours of pleuritic chest pain, dyspnea, presyncope, and new hemoptysis. On arrival, he is tachypneic with respiratory rate $RR=28$ breaths per minute, hypoxemic on room air with pulse oximetry $0.88$, and obtunded. Jugular venous pressure is elevated, heart sounds are tachycardic without murmurs, and there are clear lungs. Point-of-care ultrasound shows a dilated right ventricle with septal flattening.

            "solution": "The problem is valid. It presents a realistic clinical scenario and asks for the computation of a standard clinical index and a subsequent explanation of its pathophysiological basis, grounded in established principles of cardiovascular physiology and critical care medicine. All necessary data for the computation are provided, and the problem is well-posed, objective, and scientifically sound.\n\nThe problem asks to compute a dimensionless ratio, which is defined as the heart rate ($HR$) divided by the systolic arterial pressure ($SBP$). This is clinically known as the Shock Index ($SI$).\n\nFirst, we calculate the patient's Shock Index using the provided data.\nThe given values are:\nHeart rate, $HR = 128$ beats per minute.\nSystolic blood pressure, $SBP = 84$ $\\mathrm{mmHg}$.\n\nThe formula for the Shock Index ($SI$) is:\n$$SI = \\frac{HR}{SBP}$$\n\nSubstituting the given values into the equation:\n$$SI = \\frac{128}{84}$$\n\nPerforming the division:\n$$SI \\approx 1.5238095...$$\n\nThe problem requires rounding the numerical answer to four significant figures.\n$$SI \\approx 1.524$$\n\nNext, we must explain the mechanistic basis for this ratio's utility in early bedside risk stratification for massive versus submassive pulmonary embolism ($PE$).\n\nThe distinction between massive and submassive $PE$ is primarily hemodynamic. Massive $PE$ is characterized by sustained hypotension (e.g., $SBP  90\\,\\mathrm{mmHg}$), indicating obstructive shock and circulatory collapse. Submassive $PE$ involves right ventricular ($RV$) dysfunction or myocardial necrosis without systemic hypotension. The Shock Index ($SI$) provides an immediate quantitative measure of the relationship between the compensatory chronotropic response and the resulting systemic pressure, which is central to this distinction.\n\nThe underlying pathophysiology is as follows:\n$1$. **Obstructive Shock in Massive PE**: A large pulmonary embolus lodges in the main pulmonary artery or its major branches, causing a sudden and severe increase in pulmonary vascular resistance ($PVR$). This imposes an acute, overwhelming afterload on the $RV$.\n\n$2$. **Right Ventricular Failure**: The thin-walled $RV$ is not suited to pump against such high pressures. It dilates acutely (as evidenced by the point-of-care ultrasound showing a dilated $RV$ with septal flattening), and its contractility fails. This leads to a profound decrease in the amount of blood the $RV$ can pump into the pulmonary circulation and subsequently to the left side of the heart.\n\n$3$. **Reduced Left Ventricular Preload and Cardiac Output**: The failure of the $RV$ to propel blood forward results in decreased left ventricular ($LV$) filling (preload). According to the Frank-Starling mechanism, this reduced preload causes a significant drop in $LV$ stroke volume ($SV$). The overall cardiac output ($CO$), which is the product of heart rate and stroke volume ($CO = HR \\times SV$), plummets.\n\n$4$. **Systemic Hypotension and Compensatory Tachycardia**: The fall in cardiac output directly causes a drop in systemic arterial pressure ($BP$), as approximated by the relation $BP \\approx CO \\times SVR$ (where $SVR$ is systemic vascular resistance). The body's primary compensatory mechanism for this shock state is a powerful sympathetic nervous system activation, mediated by the baroreflex. This reflex attempts to restore perfusion by increasing both heart rate ($HR$) and systemic vascular resistance ($SVR$).\n\nThe Shock Index, $SI = \\frac{HR}{SBP}$, captures the essence of this hemodynamic struggle.\n- The numerator ($HR$) reflects the magnitude of the compensatory tachycardic response.\n- The denominator ($SBP$) reflects the net result of this compensation on systemic perfusion pressure.\n\n**Mechanistic Suitability for Risk Stratification**:\n- In **submassive PE**, the $RV$ is strained, but the compensatory mechanisms (increased $HR$ and $SVR$) are largely successful in maintaining systemic blood pressure ($SBP \\ge 90\\,\\mathrm{mmHg}$). While the $HR$ may be elevated, the $SBP$ remains within a normal or near-normal range. Consequently, the $SI$ is typically less than $1.0$.\n\n- In **massive PE**, the degree of obstruction and subsequent $RV$ failure is so severe that the compensatory tachycardia is insufficient to overcome the drastic fall in stroke volume. Despite a maximal sympathetic response driving a very high heart rate, cardiac output remains critically low, resulting in profound and persistent hypotension ($SBP  90\\,\\mathrm{mmHg}$). In this scenario, the numerator ($HR$) of the $SI$ is high, while the denominator ($SBP$) is low. This results in a high Shock Index, typically greater than $1.0$.\n\nThe patient in this case presents with an $SI$ of approximately $1.524$, which is significantly elevated. This high value indicates a state of decompensated shock where the tachycardic response is failing to maintain blood pressure, strongly suggesting a massive $PE$.\n\nTherefore, the $SI$ is mechanistically suitable as an immediate assessment tool because:\n- It is calculated from two of the most readily and non-invasively available vital signs.\n- It provides a ratio that directly quantifies the imbalance between the body's attempt to compensate (tachycardia) and the failure of that compensation to maintain perfusion (hypotension).\n- A value greater than $1.0$ serves as a simple, rapid, and evidence-supported bedside flag for a high risk of massive $PE$ and impending cardiovascular collapse, justifying immediate escalation of care even before definitive diagnostic imaging is complete.",

            "problem": "A patient with suspected pulmonary embolism (PE) presents with acute hypoxemia and hypotension. A $64$-year-old man with recent pelvic fracture and immobility develops sudden dyspnea and syncope. He is intubated for work of breathing and altered mental status. Mechanical ventilation is set to a volume-controlled mode with tidal volume $V_T = 0.5 \\ \\mathrm{L}$, respiratory rate $24 \\ \\mathrm{min}^{-1}$, and fraction of inspired oxygen $0.8$.

            "solution": "The problem statement is deemed valid after a rigorous check for scientific soundness, clarity, and completeness. The provided clinical scenario and physiological data are consistent with established medical and physiological principles.\n\nThe core of the problem lies in the interpretation of the gradient between the partial pressure of arterial carbon dioxide ($P_{a\\text{CO}_2}$) and the end-tidal carbon dioxide ($P_{et\\text{CO}_2}$).\n\nFirst, let's establish the fundamental principles of carbon dioxide transport and elimination.\nTotal ventilation, or minute ventilation ($V_E$), is the product of respiratory rate ($RR$) and tidal volume ($V_T$).\n$$V_E = RR \\times V_T$$\nIn this patient, $V_E = 24 \\ \\mathrm{min}^{-1} \\times 0.5 \\ \\mathrm{L} = 12 \\ \\mathrm{L/min}$, which is a high minute ventilation.\n\n$V_E$ is composed of two parts: alveolar ventilation ($V_A$), which participates in gas exchange, and dead space ventilation ($V_D$), which does not.\n$$V_E = V_A + V_D$$\nDead space ($V_D$) itself comprises anatomic dead space (the volume of the conducting airways) and alveolar dead space (the volume of alveoli that are ventilated but not perfused). The sum is termed physiologic dead space.\n\nThe partial pressure of CO$_2$ in arterial blood ($P_{a\\text{CO}_2}$) is determined by the balance between metabolic CO$_2$ production ($\\dot{V}_{CO_2}$) and its removal by alveolar ventilation ($V_A$). The relationship is:\n$$P_{a\\text{CO}_2} \\propto \\frac{\\dot{V}_{CO_2}}{V_A}$$\nThe end-tidal CO$_2$ ($P_{et\\text{CO}_2}$) is the concentration of CO$_2$ in the gas at the end of exhalation. In a healthy lung with well-matched ventilation ($\\dot{V}$) and perfusion ($\\dot{Q}$), the gas in the alveoli is in near-perfect equilibrium with the blood in the pulmonary capillaries. Therefore, alveolar $PCO_2$ ($P_{A\\text{CO}_2}$) is nearly identical to $P_{a\\text{CO}_2}$, and $P_{et\\text{CO}_2}$ (which reflects $P_{A\\text{CO}_2}$) is also nearly identical to $P_{a\\text{CO}_2}$. The normal $P_{a\\text{CO}_2} - P_{et\\text{CO}_2}$ gradient is small, typically $2-5 \\ \\mathrm{mmHg}$.\n\nIn this case, the gradient is calculated as:\n$$P_{a\\text{CO}_2} - P_{et\\text{CO}_2} = 32 \\ \\mathrm{mmHg} - 20 \\ \\mathrm{mmHg} = 12 \\ \\mathrm{mmHg}$$\nThis gradient is significantly widened. A widened gradient indicates that the exhaled gas contains a significant contribution from lung units that are not participating in CO$_2$ exchange. This occurs when there is an increase in alveolar dead space—that is, alveoli that are ventilated but not perfused ($\\dot{V}/\\dot{Q} \\rightarrow \\infty$). Gas exhaled from these dead space units is essentially inhaled gas, containing negligible CO$_2$. This CO$_2$-free gas mixes with the CO$_2$-rich gas from perfused alveoli, diluting the final mixture and lowering the measured $P_{et\\text{CO}_2}$.\n\nThe relationship is formalized by the Enghoff modification of the Bohr equation for physiologic dead space fraction ($V_D/V_T$):\n$$\\frac{V_D}{V_T} = \\frac{P_{a\\text{CO}_2} - P_{E\\text{CO}_2}}{P_{a\\text{CO}_2}}$$\nwhere $P_{E\\text{CO}_2}$ is the mean expired CO$_2$ pressure. As $P_{et\\text{CO}_2}$ is generally higher than $P_{E\\text{CO}_2}$ but lower than $P_{a\\text{CO}_2}$, the $P_{a\\text{CO}_2} - P_{et\\text{CO}_2}$ gradient serves as a practical bedside index of alveolar dead space. A high gradient means a high dead space fraction.\n\nIn the context of a suspected pulmonary embolism (PE), a thrombus physically obstructs pulmonary arteries, creating a large area of underperfused or non-perfused lung. This is the classic pathophysiology of increased alveolar dead space. The hypotension ($82/50 \\ \\mathrm{mmHg}$) and RV strain on ultrasound indicate a massive or high-risk PE, where the obstruction is so large that it causes right heart failure and obstructive shock. The low $P_{et\\text{CO}_2}$ of $20 \\ \\mathrm{mmHg}$ is a direct consequence of both the large dead space and the low cardiac output, which reduces CO$_2$ delivery to the lungs. Therefore, the widened gradient confirms the presence of a severe ventilation-perfusion mismatch consistent with a large PE.\n\nFurthermore, because capnography provides continuous data, trending the $P_{et\\text{CO}_2}$ is a valuable tool. Successful reperfusion therapy (e.g., thrombolysis) would restore blood flow to the obstructed segments, reduce the alveolar dead space, and improve $\\dot{V}/\\dot{Q}$ matching. This would cause the $P_{et\\text{CO}_2}$ to rise, narrowing the $P_{a\\text{CO}_2} - P_{et\\text{CO}_2}$ gradient and signaling a positive response to treatment.\n\nNow, we will evaluate each option based on this physiological reasoning.\n\nA. A $P_{a\\text{CO}_2}$–$P_{et\\text{CO}_2}$ gap of $12 \\ \\mathrm{mmHg}$ indicates increased physiologic dead space from underperfused alveoli; in suspected PE this supports a high thrombotic burden, correlates with low pulmonary capillary blood flow and cardiac output, and can be trended in real time to assess response to reperfusion (for example, systemic thrombolysis or catheter-directed therapy).\nThis statement is a precise and comprehensive summary of the pathophysiology and clinical utility of the $P_{a\\text{CO}_2}-P_{et\\text{CO}_2}$ gradient in massive PE. It correctly identifies increased dead space as the cause, links its magnitude to the thrombotic burden and hemodynamic compromise, and highlights its utility in monitoring therapy.\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\nB. A widened $P_{a\\text{CO}_2}$–$P_{et\\text{CO}_2}$ gap primarily reflects right-to-left shunt physiology; the appropriate response is to increase positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) to normalize oxygenation without addressing intravascular thrombus.\nThis is incorrect. A widened gradient is the hallmark of dead space physiology ($\\dot{V}/\\dot{Q} \\rightarrow \\infty$), not shunt physiology ($\\dot{V}/\\dot{Q} = 0$). In a shunt, blood bypasses ventilated alveoli, which primarily impairs oxygenation. Since the blood does not come into contact with alveolar gas, it does not affect the composition of exhaled gas, so the $P_{a\\text{CO}_2}-P_{et\\text{CO}_2}$ gradient is typically not significantly widened by shunt alone. Increasing PEEP is not the primary treatment for PE and can be detrimental in the setting of RV failure.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\nC. A $P_{a\\text{CO}_2}$–$P_{et\\text{CO}_2}$ gap of this magnitude proves an endotracheal tube cuff leak or ventilator malfunction; management should focus on airway equipment rather than considering thrombolysis or thrombectomy.\nThis is incorrect. The problem statement provides specific data to refute this: \"inspired and expired tidal volumes that match within $ 5 \\%$\" and \"no airway leak alarms.\" These findings make a significant equipment leak highly improbable. While equipment should always be checked, to state this \"proves\" a leak and to ignore the compelling clinical picture of a life-threatening PE is a critical error in reasoning.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\nD. The widened $P_{a\\text{CO}_2}$–$P_{et\\text{CO}_2}$ gap signifies global hypoventilation; increasing minute ventilation will normalize the gradient and resolve the underlying problem without need for antithrombotic or reperfusion therapy.\nThis is incorrect. Global hypoventilation is defined by an elevated $P_{a\\text{CO}_2}$. This patient's $P_{a\\text{CO}_2}$ is low ($32 \\ \\mathrm{mmHg}$), indicating alveolar hyperventilation of the perfused lung units. The patient's minute ventilation is already high ($12 \\ \\mathrm{L/min}$). The problem is ineffective ventilation (high dead space), not insufficient ventilation. Increasing minute ventilation further will not resolve the underlying vascular obstruction and may cause barotrauma or adverse hemodynamic effects.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\nE. In hemodynamically unstable suspected PE, a widened $P_{a\\text{CO}_2}$–$P_{et\\text{CO}_2}$ gap is a contraindication to systemic thrombolysis because it implies hyperventilation-induced hypocapnia and risks cerebral hypoxia if thrombolysis is administered.\nThis statement is dangerously incorrect. The widened gradient is a marker of the severity of the PE. In a hemodynamically unstable patient, it strongly supports the diagnosis of massive PE and is an indication for, not a contraindication to, urgent reperfusion therapy such as systemic thrombolysis. The mild hypocapnia is a physiological consequence and poses no meaningful risk compared to the imminent danger of fatal obstructive shock from the PE. The claim about cerebral hypoxia is unsubstantiated and irrelevant.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.",

The clinical presentation is a classic textbook case of massive pulmonary embolism leading to obstructive shock. The provided data (vitals, exam findings, POCUS, lactate) are all consistent with this diagnosis and with each other. The foundational physiological principles are correct and directly relevant to the pathophysiology and management of massive PE. The problem is well-posed, asking for the optimal sequence of interventions in a high-acuity, time-sensitive clinical scenario. There are no factual errors, contradictions, or ambiguities that would render the problem invalid.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. The solution process will proceed.\n\n## DERIVATION OF OPTIMAL MANAGEMENT STRATEGY\n\nThe patient is in obstructive shock due to a high likelihood of massive pulmonary embolism (PE). The diagnosis of massive PE is defined by sustained hypotension (systolic BP $ 90 \\text{ mmHg}$, or a drop of $\\ge 40 \\text{ mmHg}$ for $ 15$ minutes, or the need for vasopressors). This patient's BP is $78/46 \\text{ mmHg}$. The mean arterial pressure (MAP) can be calculated as MAP $\\approx (\\text{Diastolic BP}) + \\frac{1}{3}(\\text{Systolic BP} - \\text{Diastolic BP})$, which is $46 + \\frac{1}{3}(78-46) \\approx 56.7 \\text{ mmHg}$. This is well below the typical target of $\\ge 65 \\text{ mmHg}$ required for adequate organ perfusion. The elevated lactate ($5.2 \\ \\mathrm{mmol\\cdot L^{-1}}$) confirms end-organ hypoperfusion. The POCUS findings of acute RV failure (dilation, septal flattening) in the context of hypotension strongly support the diagnosis.\n\nBased on the provided principles, the management strategy must address the following in parallel:\n1.  **Reversing Hypoxemia**: The patient's $SpO_2$ is $84\\%$. Improving $C_{aO_2}$ is critical to improving $D_{O_2}$. However, standard intubation and PPV with high PEEP are high-risk due to their potential to worsen RV hemodynamics (Principle 4). Therefore, the initial approach should be the least invasive method that can achieve adequate oxygenation, such as a high-flow non-rebreather mask or high-flow nasal cannula.\n\n2.  **Restoring Perfusion Pressure**: The profound hypotension must be reversed to ensure perfusion of vital organs, especially the failing right ventricle itself.\n    - **Fluid Management**: The RV is already dilated and failing against a high afterload. Administering large volumes of intravenous fluids would increase RV preload and wall stress, worsening septal deviation into the LV, further impairing LV filling and systemic cardiac output ($Q$). This \"RV death spiral\" must be avoided. Therefore, large fluid boluses are contraindicated.\n    - **Vasopressor Choice**: The ideal vasopressor must increase systemic vascular resistance (SVR) to raise MAP, thereby improving coronary perfusion to the RV, without significantly increasing PVR. Norepinephrine is the first-line agent as its potent $\\alpha$-adrenergic effects raise SVR and MAP, while its modest $\\beta_1$-adrenergic effects provide some inotropic support to the heart. Its effects on PVR are less detrimental than pure $\\alpha$-agonists like phenylephrine (Principle 3).\n\n3.  **Relieving the Obstruction (Reperfusion)**: The definitive treatment is to remove or dissolve the clot.\n    - **Timing**: In massive PE with shock, time is critical. Delaying reperfusion is associated with high mortality.\n    - **Diagnosis Confirmation**: While CTPA is the gold standard, the patient is hemodynamically unstable. Transporting an unstable patient for a procedure with a $20$-minute setup time carries a high risk of cardiac arrest. The combination of the clinical picture and the specific POCUS findings provides sufficient evidence to justify emergency treatment at the bedside.\n    - **Reperfusion Modality**: Systemic thrombolysis is the fastest and most accessible reperfusion strategy. The patient has no stated contraindications. Therefore, immediate administration of a thrombolytic agent (e.g., alteplase) is indicated. Anticoagulation with unfractionated heparin should be initiated concurrently or immediately following thrombolysis per protocol.\n\n4.  **Contingency Planning**: Should the patient not respond to initial therapy or if thrombolysis is contraindicated, a plan for escalation to advanced therapies is necessary. This includes catheter-directed therapy (CDT), surgical embolectomy, and mechanical circulatory support like veno-arterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VA-ECMO) as a bridge to definitive therapy or recovery.\n\n**Summary of Optimal Algorithm:**\n- Administer high-flow oxygen.\n- Avoid large fluid boluses.\n- Initiate norepinephrine to target a MAP $\\ge 65 \\text{ mmHg}$.\n- Initiate unfractionated heparin.\n- Proceed with immediate systemic thrombolysis at the bedside based on high clinical probability and POCUS findings, without delaying for CTPA.\n- Have a clear escalation plan (CDT, surgery, VA-ECMO) in case of failure or contraindication.\n\n## OPTION-BY-OPTION ANALYSIS\n\n**A. Immediately perform endotracheal intubation with high positive end-expiratory pressure, administer a rapid $2$ L crystalloid bolus, start phenylephrine to raise MAP, obtain CTPA confirmation before any reperfusion therapy, then begin anticoagulation and consider thrombolysis only after definitive imaging.**\n- **Intubation with high PEEP**: Incorrect. This is hemodynamically dangerous in acute RV failure (Principle 4).\n- **Rapid $2$ L crystalloid bolus**: Incorrect. This will likely worsen RV failure and cardiogenic shock.\n- **Phenylephrine**: Suboptimal choice. Norepinephrine is preferred.\n- **Delaying reperfusion for CTPA**: Incorrect. The patient is too unstable for transport and the delay is life-threatening.\nThis algorithm violates multiple core principles of massive PE management.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**B. Provide high-flow oxygen (e.g., non-rebreather mask or high-flow nasal cannula) targeting oxygen saturation $ 92\\%$, avoid large fluid boluses, initiate norepinephrine to achieve MAP $\\ge 65 \\text{ mmHg}$, perform bedside confirmation with POCUS and clinical probability without delaying therapy, begin unfractionated heparin, and administer immediate systemic thrombolysis; if thrombolysis is contraindicated or fails, escalate to catheter-directed therapy or surgical embolectomy, with consideration of veno-arterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VA-ECMO) as a bridge in refractory shock.**\n- **High-flow oxygen**: Correct. Addresses hypoxemia while minimizing hemodynamic risk.\n- **Avoid large fluid boluses**: Correct. Protects the failing RV.\n- **Initiate norepinephrine**: Correct. First-line vasopressor for this condition.\n- **Bedside confirmation and immediate therapy**: Correct. Appropriate risk-benefit decision-making for a patient in shock.\n- **Unfractionated heparin and immediate systemic thrombolysis**: Correct. Standard of care for massive PE without contraindications.\n- **Escalation plan**: Correct. This represents a comprehensive and realistic approach to a critically ill patient.\nThis algorithm correctly operationalizes all the foundational principles for this scenario.\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\n**C. Begin with dobutamine to augment RV contractility, give intravenous loop diuretics to reduce RV wall stress, prioritize CTPA for definitive diagnosis, then start anticoagulation; avoid systemic thrombolysis in hemodynamic instability and plan elective catheter-directed therapy once stabilized.**\n- **Begin with dobutamine**: Incorrect. Dobutamine will cause vasodilation and worsen the already severe hypotension. It is only an option after MAP has been restored.\n- **IV loop diuretics**: Incorrect. The patient is in shock from obstruction, not volume overload. Diuretics will worsen hypovolemia and hypotension.\n- **Prioritize CTPA**: Incorrect. Unsafe delay.\n- **Avoid systemic thrombolysis in hemodynamic instability**: Incorrect. This is a direct contradiction of the primary indication for thrombolysis in PE.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**D. Apply noninvasive ventilation with high positive end-expiratory pressure, start vasopressin as sole vasopressor, administer a $1$–$2$ L fluid challenge to increase RV preload, withhold anticoagulation due to bleeding risk, and proceed directly to catheter-directed thrombolysis instead of systemic thrombolysis regardless of availability or timing.**\n- **NIV with high PEEP**: Incorrect. High PEEP is detrimental (Principle 4).\n- **Vasopressin as sole vasopressor**: Incorrect. Not the first-line agent.\n- **$1$–$2$ L fluid challenge**: Incorrect. This is a large, dangerous fluid load for the failing RV.\n- **Withhold anticoagulation**: Incorrect. The problem explicitly states \"no known bleeding diathesis\", so there is no justification for withholding heparin.\n- **Proceed directly to CDT**: Incorrect. Systemic thrombolysis is faster and the preferred initial strategy in this situation.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**E. Provide supplemental oxygen, start norepinephrine, call immediately for VA-ECMO cannulation before any reperfusion therapy, bypass systemic thrombolysis entirely, and arrange for surgical embolectomy as the only definitive therapy even if systemic thrombolysis is immediately available and there are no contraindications.**\n- **O2 and norepinephrine**: Correct initial steps.\n- **ECMO before any reperfusion**: Incorrect. This inverts the proper sequence. Thrombolysis is a rapid intervention, while ECMO is a resource-intensive rescue therapy. One should not delay a faster indicated therapy for a slower, more invasive one. ECMO is a bridge *from* failure of initial therapies, not the first step.\n- **Bypass systemic thrombolysis entirely**: Incorrect. This ignores the most readily available and indicated life-saving treatment.\n- **Surgical embolectomy as only therapy**: Incorrect. This is dogmatic and ignores less invasive, effective options.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**",
