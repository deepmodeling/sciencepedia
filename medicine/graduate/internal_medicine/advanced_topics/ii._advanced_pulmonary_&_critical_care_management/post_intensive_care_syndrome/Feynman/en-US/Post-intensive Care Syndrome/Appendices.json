            "problem": "A patient recovering from sepsis and prolonged mechanical ventilation is evaluated for Post-Intensive Care Syndrome (PICS) using bedside strength testing. The Medical Research Council (MRC) scale for muscle strength grades each tested muscle group from $0$ (no contraction) to $5$ (normal strength). The MRC sum score is defined as the sum of $12$ bilateral muscle group grades: shoulder abduction, elbow flexion, and wrist extension in the upper limbs; hip flexion, knee extension, and ankle dorsiflexion in the lower limbs, tested on both sides. Intensive Care Unit–Acquired Weakness (ICU-AW) is diagnosed when the MRC sum score is $ < 48$, provided the patient is awake, can follow commands, and has no confounding factors such as deep sedation or focal neurological deficits.\n\nAssume the patient is awake, follows two-step commands, is pain-controlled, and has no focal neurological deficits. The individual MRC grades are:\n- Left shoulder abduction $4$, right shoulder abduction $4$;\n- Left elbow flexion $3$, right elbow flexion $4$;\n- Left wrist extension $4$, right wrist extension $5$;\n- Left hip flexion $3$, right hip flexion $3$;\n- Left knee extension $4$, right knee extension $4$;\n- Left ankle dorsiflexion $2$, right ankle dorsiflexion $3$.\n\nUsing the definition that an “affected” muscle group is one with MRC grade $\\leq 4$ (i.e., any weakness compared with normal grade $5$), compute the proportion of affected muscle groups among the $12$ tested and, based on the MRC sum score threshold of $ < 48$, interpret the diagnostic certainty for ICU-AW under the stated examination conditions.\n\nExpress the final proportion as a decimal fraction and round your answer to four significant figures. Do not use a percentage sign.",
            "solution": "The problem statement is evaluated and found to be valid. It is scientifically grounded in the clinical practice of critical care medicine, using established tools like the Medical Research Council (MRC) sum score. It is well-posed, providing all necessary data—the individual muscle group grades—and clear, objective definitions for Intensive Care Unit–Acquired Weakness (ICU-AW) and \"affected\" muscle groups. The problem is self-contained and allows for a unique, verifiable solution.\n\nThe problem requires two primary tasks: first, to interpret the diagnostic certainty for ICU-AW based on the MRC sum score, and second, to compute the proportion of affected muscle groups.\n\nFirst, we will calculate the MRC sum score and interpret the diagnosis. The MRC sum score is the sum of the grades from $12$ specified bilateral muscle groups. The patient's individual grades are provided as:\n- Left shoulder abduction: $4$\n- Right shoulder abduction: $4$\n- Left elbow flexion: $3$\n- Right elbow flexion: $4$\n- Left wrist extension: $4$\n- Right wrist extension: $5$\n- Left hip flexion: $3$\n- Right hip flexion: $3$\n- Left knee extension: $4$\n- Right knee extension: $4$\n- Left ankle dorsiflexion: $2$\n- Right ankle dorsiflexion: $3$\n\nThe MRC sum score, denoted as $S_{MRC}$, is the summation of these $12$ values:\n$$S_{MRC} = 4 + 4 + 3 + 4 + 4 + 5 + 3 + 3 + 4 + 4 + 2 + 3$$\n$$S_{MRC} = 43$$\nThe diagnostic criterion for ICU-AW is an MRC sum score less than $48$. Since the calculated score is $S_{MRC} = 43$, the condition $43 < 48$ is met.\nThe problem statement explicitly confirms that the patient is awake, follows commands, and has no confounding factors. These are the necessary prerequisites for a valid MRC score assessment. Therefore, under the stated examination conditions, the application of the diagnostic rule is direct. The diagnosis of ICU-Acquired Weakness is confirmed with a high degree of certainty based on the provided clinical definition and data.\n\nSecond, we will compute the proportion of affected muscle groups. An \"affected\" muscle group is defined as having an MRC grade $\\leq 4$. The total number of tested muscle groups is $N_{total} = 12$. We must identify and count the number of muscle groups, $N_{affected}$, that meet this criterion.\n\nReviewing the list of scores:\n- Left shoulder abduction: $4$ ($\\leq 4$, affected)\n- Right shoulder abduction: $4$ ($\\leq 4$, affected)\n- Left elbow flexion: $3$ ($\\leq 4$, affected)\n- Right elbow flexion: $4$ ($\\leq 4$, affected)\n- Left wrist extension: $4$ ($\\leq 4$, affected)\n- Right wrist extension: $5$ ($> 4$, not affected)\n- Left hip flexion: $3$ ($\\leq 4$, affected)\n- Right hip flexion: $3$ ($\\leq 4$, affected)\n- Left knee extension: $4$ ($\\leq 4$, affected)\n- Right knee extension: $4$ ($\\leq 4$, affected)\n- Left ankle dorsiflexion: $2$ ($\\leq 4$, affected)\n- Right ankle dorsiflexion: $3$ ($\\leq 4$, affected)\n\nBy counting, we find that $11$ of the $12$ muscle groups have a score less than or equal to $4$. Thus, $N_{affected} = 11$.\n\nThe proportion of affected muscle groups, $P$, is the ratio of the number of affected groups to the total number of groups:\n$$P = \\frac{N_{affected}}{N_{total}} = \\frac{11}{12}$$\nTo express this as a decimal fraction, we perform the division:\n$$P = \\frac{11}{12} \\approx 0.916666...$$\nThe problem requires this value to be rounded to four significant figures.\n$$P \\approx 0.9167$$\nThe first significant figure is $9$, the second is $1$, the third is $6$, and the fourth is $6$. The fifth digit is $6$, which is greater than or equal to $5$, so we round up the fourth digit.\nTherefore, the proportion of affected muscle groups, rounded to four significant figures, is $0.9167$.",

            "problem": "An adult patient in the intensive care unit (ICU) at risk for Post-Intensive Care Syndrome (PICS) is undergoing quantitative skeletal muscle monitoring. The rectus femoris cross-sectional area (CSA), measured by ultrasound, is used as a proxy for muscle mass, which is closely linked to physical function, exercise capacity, and long-term outcomes in PICS.

The use of relative change and error propagation are fundamental concepts in biostatistics and measurement science. The given values for CSA and its change are clinically realistic. The problem is scientifically sound.\n- **Well-Posed**: The problem provides all necessary data and a clear definition of the quantity to be calculated. The instructions on methodology (error propagation) and final format (decimal rounded to $3$ significant figures) are unambiguous. A unique and meaningful solution exists.\n- **Objective**: The problem is stated using precise, quantitative language. It is free of subjectivity or opinion.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is deemed **valid**. A complete, reasoned solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution Derivation\nThe primary objective is to compute the weekly percentage change in the rectus femoris cross-sectional area (CSA) and to assess the significance of this change in the context of its measurement uncertainty.\n\nLet $A_1$ be the CSA at day $3$ and $A_2$ be the CSA at day $10$. The given values are:\n$$ A_1 = 3.0\\,\\text{cm}^{2} $$\n$$ A_2 = 2.4\\,\\text{cm}^{2} $$\nThe associated one-standard-deviation uncertainties are:\n$$ \\sigma_{A_1} = 0.10\\,\\text{cm}^{2} $$\n$$ \\sigma_{A_2} = 0.10\\,\\text{cm}^{2} $$\n\nThe weekly percentage change, expressed as a decimal (which we will denote by $C$), is the relative change with respect to the initial measurement $A_1$.\n$$ C = \\frac{A_2 - A_1}{A_1} $$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$ C = \\frac{2.4 - 3.0}{3.0} = \\frac{-0.6}{3.0} = -0.2 $$\nThis represents a $20\\%$ decrease in muscle CSA. To meet the problem's formatting requirement, this value must be expressed with $3$ significant figures.\n$$ C = -0.200 $$\n\nTo reason about the clinical significance, we must determine if this observed change is a true biological effect or simply a result of measurement error. This requires propagating the uncertainties of the individual measurements to find the uncertainty of the calculated change, $\\sigma_C$.\n\nThe expression for the change $C$ can be rewritten as:\n$$ C = \\frac{A_2}{A_1} - 1 $$\nThe uncertainty in a constant ($1$) is zero, so the uncertainty in $C$ is equal to the uncertainty in the ratio $R = \\frac{A_2}{A_1}$.\n$$ \\sigma_C = \\sigma_R $$\nWe use the first-order error propagation formula for a function of two independent variables, $R(A_1, A_2)$. The variance $\\sigma_R^2$ is given by:\n$$ \\sigma_R^2 \\approx \\left(\\frac{\\partial R}{\\partial A_1}\\right)^2 \\sigma_{A_1}^2 + \\left(\\frac{\\partial R}{\\partial A_2}\\right)^2 \\sigma_{A_2}^2 $$\nThe partial derivatives of $R = \\frac{A_2}{A_1}$ are:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial R}{\\partial A_1} = -\\frac{A_2}{A_1^2} $$\n$$ \\frac{\\partial R}{\\partial A_2} = \\frac{1}{A_1} $$\nSubstituting these into the variance formula:\n$$ \\sigma_R^2 \\approx \\left(-\\frac{A_2}{A_1^2}\\right)^2 \\sigma_{A_1}^2 + \\left(\\frac{1}{A_1}\\right)^2 \\sigma_{A_2}^2 = \\frac{A_2^2}{A_1^4} \\sigma_{A_1}^2 + \\frac{1}{A_1^2} \\sigma_{A_2}^2 $$\nIt is often more convenient to work with relative uncertainties. Dividing by $R^2 = (\\frac{A_2}{A_1})^2$ gives the standard formula for the relative variance of a ratio:\n$$ \\left(\\frac{\\sigma_R}{R}\\right)^2 \\approx \\frac{\\sigma_{A_1}^2}{A_1^2} + \\frac{\\sigma_{A_2}^2}{A_2^2} $$\nNow, we substitute the numerical values (working with the magnitudes, as units are consistent and cancel):\n$$ R = \\frac{A_2}{A_1} = \\frac{2.4}{3.0} = 0.8 $$\n$$ \\left(\\frac{\\sigma_R}{0.8}\\right)^2 \\approx \\left(\\frac{0.10}{3.0}\\right)^2 + \\left(\\frac{0.10}{2.4}\\right)^2 $$\n$$ \\left(\\frac{\\sigma_R}{0.8}\\right)^2 \\approx (0.001111...) + (0.001736...) \\approx 0.002847... $$\n$$ \\sigma_R^2 \\approx (0.8)^2 \\times 0.002847... = 0.64 \\times 0.002847... \\approx 0.001822... $$\nThe standard deviation $\\sigma_R$ is the square root of the variance:\n$$ \\sigma_R = \\sqrt{0.001822...} \\approx 0.04268 $$\nThus, the uncertainty in the weekly percentage change is $\\sigma_C = \\sigma_R \\approx 0.0427$.\n\nThe complete result for the weekly change is $C = -0.200 \\pm 0.043$.\n\nTo assess whether the observed change plausibly exceeds measurement error, we can calculate a signal-to-noise ratio, which is the magnitude of the change divided by its uncertainty:\n$$ \\text{Significance} = \\frac{|C|}{\\sigma_C} = \\frac{|-0.200|}{0.04268} \\approx 4.69 $$\nThe observed decrease of $20\\%$ is approximately $4.7$ times its standard uncertainty. In statistical terms, this change is $4.7$ standard deviations away from zero (the null hypothesis of no change). This is a highly statistically significant result, providing strong evidence that the observed muscle atrophy is a real physiological process and not an artifact of measurement variability. A $20\\%$ reduction in a key thigh muscle's cross-sectional area over a single week is a dramatic and clinically significant finding, indicative of severe ICU-acquired weakness, which is a major driver of the physical disability component of Post-Intensive Care Syndrome (PICS).\n\nThe problem asks only for the numerical computation of the weekly percentage change.\nFinal computation: $C = -0.2$.\nRounding to $3$ significant figures gives $-0.200$.",
