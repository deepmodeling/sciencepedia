            "problem": "An adult with asthma is being evaluated for Allergic Bronchopulmonary Aspergillosis (ABPA). In this referral population, the pretest probability of ABPA is $p_{0} = 0.08$. You will use the odds form of Bayes’ theorem as the foundational base and interpret each test result via its likelihood ratio, combining evidence sequentially. After obtaining the posterior odds, define a composite score $S$ as the base-$10$ log-odds scaled by $10$, so that $S$ increases linearly with weight of evidence.\n\nAssume the following dichotomized tests and operating characteristics (defined for a positive result), each applied independently given disease status:\n- Aspergillus fumigatus–specific Immunoglobulin E (IgE) positivity: sensitivity $0.92$, specificity $0.72$.\n- Peripheral eosinophilia $\\geq 500$ cells per microliter: sensitivity $0.78$, specificity $0.65$.\n- Serum precipitins (Immunoglobulin G (IgG) to Aspergillus fumigatus) by immunodiffusion positive: sensitivity $0.68$, specificity $0.91$.\n- High-Resolution Computed Tomography (HRCT) showing central bronchiectasis with mucus plugging: sensitivity $0.61$, specificity $0.96$.\n\nFor the patient in question, all four tests above are positive.\n\nStarting only from Bayes’ theorem in odds form and the definition of sensitivity, specificity, and likelihood ratios, derive and compute the composite score $S$ corresponding to these results. Then, by converting the posterior odds back to probability, interpret which diagnostic certainty category applies under the following scheme: “unlikely” if posterior probability $ 0.1$, “possible” if posterior probability in $[0.1, 0.5)$, “probable” if posterior probability in $[0.5, 0.9)$, and “very likely” if posterior probability $\\geq 0.9$.\n\nRound your final composite score to four significant figures. Report the composite score as a pure number (dimensionless).",
            "solution": "The problem requires the calculation of a composite diagnostic score, $S$, and an interpretation of the diagnostic certainty for Allergic Bronchopulmonary Aspergillosis (ABPA) based on a series of positive test results. The solution will be derived from first principles using the odds form of Bayes' theorem.\n\nFirst, let us define the relevant variables and relationships. Let $D$ be the event that the patient has ABPA, and $D^c$ be the event that the patient does not have ABPA. The pretest probability is given as $P(D) = p_0 = 0.08$.\n\nThe odds of an event with probability $p$ are defined as $O = \\frac{p}{1-p}$. The prior odds of having ABPA are therefore:\n$$O_{prior} = \\frac{P(D)}{P(D^c)} = \\frac{p_0}{1-p_0} = \\frac{0.08}{1-0.08} = \\frac{0.08}{0.92} = \\frac{8}{92} = \\frac{2}{23}$$\n\nBayes' theorem in odds form states that the posterior odds after observing evidence $E$ are the product of the prior odds and the likelihood ratio ($LR$) of the evidence:\n$$\\text{Posterior Odds} = \\text{Prior Odds} \\times LR$$\n$$O_{post} = O_{prior} \\times LR(E)$$\n\nThe likelihood ratio for a positive test result ($T^+$) is defined as the ratio of the probability of a positive test in a diseased individual to the probability of a positive test in a non-diseased individual:\n$$LR_+ = \\frac{P(T^+|D)}{P(T^+|D^c)}$$\n\nThe terms in the likelihood ratio can be expressed using sensitivity ($sens$) and specificity ($spec$). Sensitivity is the true positive rate, $sens = P(T^+|D)$. Specificity is the true negative rate, $spec = P(T^-|D^c)$, where $T^-$ is a negative test result. It follows that the false positive rate is $P(T^+|D^c) = 1 - P(T^-|D^c) = 1 - spec$.\nTherefore, the likelihood ratio for a positive test is:\n$$LR_+ = \\frac{sens}{1 - spec}$$\n\nThe problem provides four independent tests, all of which are positive. Let the positive test results be $T_1^+, T_2^+, T_3^+, T_4^+$. Since the tests are conditionally independent given the disease status, the total likelihood ratio is the product of the individual likelihood ratios:\n$$LR_{total} = LR_{+,1} \\times LR_{+,2} \\times LR_{+,3} \\times LR_{+,4}$$\n\nWe now calculate the individual likelihood ratios for each positive test:\n1.  **Aspergillus fumigatus–specific IgE ($T_1^+$):**\n    $sens_1 = 0.92$, $spec_1 = 0.72$\n    $$LR_{+,1} = \\frac{sens_1}{1-spec_1} = \\frac{0.92}{1-0.72} = \\frac{0.92}{0.28} = \\frac{92}{28} = \\frac{23}{7}$$\n2.  **Peripheral eosinophilia ($T_2^+$):**\n    $sens_2 = 0.78$, $spec_2 = 0.65$\n    $$LR_{+,2} = \\frac{sens_2}{1-spec_2} = \\frac{0.78}{1-0.65} = \\frac{0.78}{0.35} = \\frac{78}{35}$$\n3.  **Serum precipitins IgG ($T_3^+$):**\n    $sens_3 = 0.68$, $spec_3 = 0.91$\n    $$LR_{+,3} = \\frac{sens_3}{1-spec_3} = \\frac{0.68}{1-0.91} = \\frac{0.68}{0.09} = \\frac{68}{9}$$\n4.  **HRCT ($T_4^+$):**\n    $sens_4 = 0.61$, $spec_4 = 0.96$\n    $$LR_{+,4} = \\frac{sens_4}{1-spec_4} = \\frac{0.61}{1-0.96} = \\frac{0.61}{0.04} = \\frac{61}{4}$$\n\nNext, we calculate the posterior odds, $O_{post}$, by updating the prior odds with the total likelihood ratio:\n$$O_{post} = O_{prior} \\times LR_{+,1} \\times LR_{+,2} \\times LR_{+,3} \\times LR_{+,4}$$\n$$O_{post} = \\left(\\frac{2}{23}\\right) \\times \\left(\\frac{23}{7}\\right) \\times \\left(\\frac{78}{35}\\right) \\times \\left(\\frac{68}{9}\\right) \\times \\left(\\frac{61}{4}\\right)$$\nThe term $\\frac{23}{23}$ cancels out:\n$$O_{post} = \\frac{2}{7} \\times \\frac{78}{35} \\times \\frac{68}{9} \\times \\frac{61}{4}$$\nWe can perform the multiplication:\n$$O_{post} = \\frac{2 \\times 78 \\times 68 \\times 61}{7 \\times 35 \\times 9 \\times 4} = \\frac{646752}{8820}$$\nSimplifying the fraction gives:\n$$O_{post} = \\frac{53896}{735} \\approx 73.327891$$\n\nThe composite score $S$ is defined as the base-$10$ log-odds scaled by $10$:\n$$S = 10 \\log_{10}(O_{post})$$\nSubstituting the value for $O_{post}$:\n$$S = 10 \\log_{10}\\left(\\frac{53896}{735}\\right) \\approx 10 \\log_{10}(73.327891)$$\n$$S \\approx 10 \\times 1.865267 \\approx 18.65267$$\nRounding the composite score to four significant figures gives:\n$$S \\approx 18.65$$\n\nFinally, we interpret the diagnostic certainty. To do this, we convert the posterior odds back to a posterior probability, $p_{post}$:\n$$p_{post} = \\frac{O_{post}}{1+O_{post}}$$\n$$p_{post} = \\frac{53896/735}{1 + 53896/735} = \\frac{53896/735}{(735+53896)/735} = \\frac{53896}{54631}$$\n$$p_{post} \\approx 0.986546$$\nAccording to the given scheme:\n- “unlikely” if posterior probability $ 0.1$\n- “possible” if posterior probability in $[0.1, 0.5)$\n- “probable” if posterior probability in $[0.5, 0.9)$\n- “very likely” if posterior probability $\\geq 0.9$\n\nSince $p_{post} \\approx 0.987$, which is greater than or equal to $0.9$, the diagnostic certainty category is “very likely”.",

            "problem": "A patient with allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA) is initiated on systemic glucocorticoid therapy to suppress immunologically mediated airway inflammation. The systemic corticosteroid chosen is prednisone. The dosing strategy follows a weight-based initiation and a structured taper to balance efficacy with minimization of adverse effects. The regimen is as follows: initiate a daily prednisone dose of $0.5$ mg/kg/day for $14$ days, then reduce the daily dose by $5$ mg at the start of each subsequent $7$-day interval until the daily dose first reaches $5$ mg/day. Assume the patient’s body weight is $60$ kg, adherence is perfect, and the daily dose is constant within each interval.\n\nUsing the foundational definitions that a weight-based daily dose in mg/day equals the product of body weight (in kg) and the per-kilogram dosing (in mg/kg/day), and that cumulative dose (in mg) over an interval equals the product of the constant daily dose (in mg/day) and the number of days in that interval, compute the total cumulative prednisone dose administered from day $1$ through the end of the $7$-day interval at which the dose first reaches $5$ mg/day under this regimen.\n\nExpress your final answer as a single real number in milligrams.

            "solution": "The task is to compute the total cumulative dose of prednisone administered to a patient according to a specified regimen. The calculation is broken down into two phases: an initial weight-based dosing phase and a subsequent tapering phase.\n\nFirst, we establish the parameters given in the problem statement.\nThe patient's body weight is $W = 60 \\text{ kg}$.\nThe initial dosing rate is $R_{initial} = 0.5 \\text{ mg/kg/day}$.\nThe duration of the initial phase is $T_{initial} = 14 \\text{ days}$.\nThe dose reduction at each step of the taper is $\\Delta D = 5 \\text{ mg}$.\nThe duration of each tapering interval is $T_{taper} = 7 \\text{ days}$.\nThe tapering continues until the daily dose first reaches $D_{final} = 5 \\text{ mg/day}$.\n\nStep 1: Calculate the daily dose for the initial phase.\nUsing the provided definition, the daily dose is the product of the body weight and the per-kilogram dosing rate.\n$$D_{initial} = W \\times R_{initial} = 60 \\text{ kg} \\times 0.5 \\text{ mg/kg/day} = 30 \\text{ mg/day}$$\n\nStep 2: Calculate the cumulative dose for the initial phase.\nThe cumulative dose over this interval is the product of the constant daily dose and the number of days.\n$$C_{initial} = D_{initial} \\times T_{initial} = 30 \\text{ mg/day} \\times 14 \\text{ days} = 420 \\text{ mg}$$\n\nStep 3: Determine the sequence of daily doses and the duration of the tapering phase.\nThe tapering phase begins after the initial $14$ days. At the start of each subsequent $7$-day interval, the daily dose is reduced by $5$ mg. The sequence of daily doses forms an arithmetic progression. The first dose in the tapering sequence is $D_1 = D_{initial} - \\Delta D = 30 \\text{ mg} - 5 \\text{ mg} = 25 \\text{ mg/day}$.\n\nLet $D_k$ be the daily dose during the $k$-th tapering interval.

This corresponds to the end of the 5th tapering interval. Each of these five intervals lasts for $T_{taper} = 7$ days.\n\nStep 4: Calculate the cumulative dose for the tapering phase.\nThe total cumulative dose during the taper, $C_{taper}$, is the sum of the doses from each of the five tapering intervals.\n$$C_{taper} = (D_1 \\times T_{taper}) + (D_2 \\times T_{taper}) + (D_3 \\times T_{taper}) + (D_4 \\times T_{taper}) + (D_5 \\times T_{taper})$$\nWe can factor out $T_{taper}$:\n$$C_{taper} = T_{taper} \\times (D_1 + D_2 + D_3 + D_4 + D_5)$$\n$$C_{taper} = 7 \\text{ days} \\times (25 + 20 + 15 + 10 + 5) \\text{ mg/day}$$\nThe sum of the daily doses in the parentheses is the sum of an arithmetic series:\n$$\\sum D_k = 25 + 20 + 15 + 10 + 5 = 75 \\text{ mg/day}$$\nNow, we can calculate the cumulative dose for the taper:\n$$C_{taper} = 7 \\times 75 = 525 \\text{ mg}$$\n\nStep 5: Calculate the total cumulative dose.\nThe total cumulative dose, $C_{total}$, is the sum of the cumulative doses from the initial phase and the tapering phase.\n$$C_{total} = C_{initial} + C_{taper}$$\n$$C_{total} = 420 \\text{ mg} + 525 \\text{ mg} = 945 \\text{ mg}$$\nThe total cumulative prednisone dose administered throughout the described regimen is $945$ milligrams.",
