            "problem": "A $52$-year-old man presents with $4$ days of progressive distal paresthesias in the feet followed by symmetric lower limb weakness that has ascended to involve hip flexors. Examination shows generalized areflexia, mild distal vibration loss, and no cranial nerve deficits. He has no prior neuropathy, no diabetes, and takes no neurotoxic medications. Cerebrospinal fluid shows albuminocytologic dissociation at day $7$. Nerve conduction studies (NCS) at day $6$ demonstrate the following: bilateral median and ulnar sensory nerve action potential (SNAP) amplitudes are reduced, while bilateral sural SNAP amplitudes are within laboratory reference limits; motor studies show prolonged distal motor latencies and reduced conduction velocities in multiple nerves without significant axonal amplitude loss. The electrophysiology report comments on a “sural sparing” pattern. The clinician wants to use this finding to refine the diagnosis among Guillain–Barré syndrome (GBS), length-dependent axonal polyneuropathies, and focal entrapment neuropathies.\n\nUse the following foundational facts as the starting point for your reasoning: sensory neuron cell bodies reside in the dorsal root ganglion; a SNAP amplitude recorded distally reflects the summed response of intact distal sensory axons; demyelination localized proximal to the dorsal root ganglion may impair central conduction while leaving distal sensory axons structurally intact; length-dependent axonal polyneuropathies preferentially affect the longest distal axons first, often earliest in the sural nerve. For test interpretation, assume that in this clinical context the presence of a rigorously defined sural sparing pattern (preserved sural SNAP with abnormal median and at least one other upper-limb sensory SNAP) has sensitivity $0.55$ and specificity $0.92$ for demyelinating GBS; the pretest probability of GBS given the presentation is $0.40$.\n\nWhich option best explains the anatomic-electrophysiologic basis of the sural sparing pattern and correctly applies its diagnostic utility against other neuropathies, including an appropriate estimate of the post-test probability of GBS when sural sparing is present?\n\nA. Sural sparing arises because immune-mediated demyelination in GBS predominantly involves proximal preganglionic segments (roots and proximal nerves), leaving distal sensory axons intact and thus preserving sural SNAPs, whereas length-dependent axonal polyneuropathies reduce sural SNAPs early. With sensitivity $0.55$, specificity $0.92$, and a pretest probability of $0.40$, the post-test probability of GBS if sural sparing is present is approximately $0.82$.\n\nB. Sural sparing arises because GBS is a purely motor neuropathy in which all sensory SNAPs remain normal; therefore the pattern is nonspecific. With sensitivity $0.55$, specificity $0.92$, and a pretest probability of $0.40$, the post-test probability of GBS if sural sparing is present is approximately $0.55$.\n\nC. Sural sparing arises because distal ischemia preferentially injures upper-limb cutaneous nerves while relatively sparing the sural nerve; in diabetic polyneuropathy the sural SNAP is usually preserved until late. If sensitivity is $0.92$ and specificity $0.55$ for sural sparing in this context and the pretest probability is $0.40$, the post-test probability of GBS when sural sparing is present is approximately $0.67$.\n\nD. Sural sparing reflects early dorsal root ganglion neuronal loss, which abolishes sural SNAPs while preserving upper-limb SNAPs; thus it cannot meaningfully distinguish GBS from length-dependent polyneuropathies. With sensitivity $0.55$, specificity $0.92$, and a pretest probability of $0.40$, the post-test probability of GBS when sural sparing is present is approximately $0.31$.",
            "solution": "The solution must evaluate the options based on two criteria: the correctness of the pathophysiological explanation and the accuracy of the post-test probability calculation.\n\n**1. Pathophysiological Basis of Sural Sparing**\n\nThe \"sural sparing\" pattern is a key electrophysiologic clue that strongly suggests a demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy like Guillain–Barré syndrome (GBS) over a length-dependent axonal polyneuropathy.\n-   In GBS (specifically the AIDP variant), the immune attack primarily targets myelin at the nerve roots, which are proximal to the dorsal root ganglion (DRG) where sensory neuron cell bodies are located.\n-   This proximal, pre-ganglionic demyelination can block nerve impulses traveling to the central nervous system without damaging the distal sensory axon.\n-   The sensory nerve action potential (SNAP) is recorded from this distal axon. Therefore, its amplitude can be preserved despite significant proximal disease.\n-   In contrast, length-dependent axonal polyneuropathies (e.g., from diabetes) affect the longest nerve fibers first. The sural nerve, innervating the foot, contains some of the longest axons in the body and is typically affected early, leading to a reduced or absent SNAP.\n-   Therefore, finding preserved sural SNAPs in the context of abnormal SNAPs in other nerves (e.g., median/ulnar) is highly suggestive of a proximal demyelinating process like GBS.\n\n**2. Calculation of Post-Test Probability**\n\nWe use Bayes' theorem to update the probability of GBS given a positive test result (presence of sural sparing).\nLet $D$ represent the event that the patient has GBS, and $T$ represent a positive test result.\n\n-   Pre-test probability of GBS: $P(D) = 0.40$\n-   Sensitivity (probability of positive test if GBS is present): $P(T|D) = 0.55$\n-   Specificity (probability of negative test if GBS is absent): $P(\\neg T|\\neg D) = 0.92$\n\nFrom these, we can derive:\n-   Pre-test probability of not having GBS: $P(\\neg D) = 1 - 0.40 = 0.60$\n-   False positive rate (probability of positive test if GBS is absent): $P(T|\\neg D) = 1 - P(\\neg T|\\neg D) = 1 - 0.92 = 0.08$\n\nThe post-test probability, $P(D|T)$, is calculated as:\n$$P(D|T) = \\frac{P(T|D)P(D)}{P(T|D)P(D) + P(T|\\neg D)P(\\neg D)}$$\n$$P(D|T) = \\frac{(0.55)(0.40)}{(0.55)(0.40) + (0.08)(0.60)} = \\frac{0.22}{0.22 + 0.048} = \\frac{0.22}{0.268} \\approx 0.8209$$\n\n**3. Evaluation of Options**\n\n-   **A:** The pathophysiological explanation is correct, and the calculated post-test probability of approximately $0.82$ is correct.\n-   **B:** Incorrect. GBS is typically a sensorimotor neuropathy, not purely motor. The case details and NCS results confirm sensory involvement.\n-   **C:** Incorrect. The proposed mechanism (ischemia) is wrong for GBS. The statement about diabetic polyneuropathy is also incorrect (sural nerve is affected early). It also swaps sensitivity and specificity, and the resulting calculation is wrong.\n-   **D:** Incorrect. Sural sparing means the sural SNAP is *preserved*, not abolished. The entire premise is a contradiction.\n\nTherefore, option A is the only one that correctly combines the pathophysiology and the statistical calculation.",

            "problem": "A patient with suspected Guillain–Barré syndrome (GBS) presents to the emergency department. In GBS, the risk of respiratory insufficiency requiring mechanical ventilation is driven by rapid disease progression, cranial nerve (facial or bulbar) involvement, and the extent of global motor weakness assessed by the Medical Research Council (MRC) sum score. The Erasmus GBS Respiratory Insufficiency Score (EGRIS) is a well-validated clinical prediction tool that incorporates these three dimensions. Use the following fundamental facts to quantify the risk of mechanical ventilation within the first week of admission.\n\nDefinitions and foundational facts:\n- Guillain–Barré syndrome (GBS) is an acute immune-mediated polyradiculoneuropathy characterized by rapidly progressive weakness, often with cranial nerve involvement and risk of respiratory failure.\n- The Medical Research Council (MRC) grading scale evaluates strength in $6$ bilateral muscle groups (e.g., shoulder abduction, elbow flexion, wrist extension, hip flexion, knee extension, and ankle dorsiflexion) where each muscle group is graded from $0$ to $5$, yielding an MRC sum score ranging from $0$ to $60$.\n- The Erasmus GBS Respiratory Insufficiency Score (EGRIS) assigns points based on three admission variables:\n  1. Days between onset of weakness and hospital admission: $\\leq 3$ days $\\rightarrow 2$ points; $4$–$7$ days $\\rightarrow 1$ point; $>7$ days $\\rightarrow 0$ points.\n  2.
