            "problem": "A public health system is considering a population-based screening program for an asymptomatic cancer using a single-step test applied to an average-risk adult population. The test characteristics, established in large validation cohorts, are sensitivity $Se=0.90$ and specificity $Sp=0.95$. The target population has a disease prevalence $\\pi=0.01$. Starting from the fundamental definitions of sensitivity, specificity, prevalence, and conditional probability, and without invoking any pre-memorized shortcut formulas, derive expressions for the positive predictive value $PPV$ and the negative predictive value $NPV$ in terms of $Se$, $Sp$, and $\\pi$, and then compute their numerical values for the given parameters.

It is free of subjective or opinion-based statements.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. It contains no contradictions, ambiguities, or invalid premises. Therefore, the problem is **valid**. A full solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nWe begin by formally defining the events and probabilities based on the provided information.\nLet $D$ be the event that an individual from the population has the disease (cancer), and $D^c$ be the event that the individual does not have the disease.\nLet $T^+$ be the event that the test result is positive, and $T^-$ be the event that the test result is negative.\n\nFrom the problem statement, we can translate the given parameters into conditional probabilities:\n1.  **Prevalence ($\\pi$)**: The a priori probability that a randomly selected individual has the disease.\n    $$P(D) = \\pi = 0.01$$\n    The probability of not having the disease is therefore:\n    $$P(D^c) = 1 - P(D) = 1 - \\pi = 1 - 0.01 = 0.99$$\n\n2.  **Sensitivity ($Se$)**: The probability of a positive test result given that the individual has the disease. This is the true positive rate.\n    $$Se = P(T^+ | D) = 0.90$$\n\n3.  **Specificity ($Sp$)**: The probability of a negative test result given that the individual does not have the disease. This is the true negative rate.\n    $$Sp = P(T^- | D^c) = 0.95$$\n\nFrom these definitions, we can also define the complementary probabilities:\n-   The false negative rate (FNR), the probability of a negative test in a diseased individual, is:\n    $$P(T^- | D) = 1 - P(T^+ | D) = 1 - Se$$\n-   The false positive rate (FPR), the probability of a positive test in a disease-free individual, is:\n    $$P(T^+ | D^c) = 1 - P(T^- | D^c) = 1 - Sp$$\n\nOur objective is to derive expressions for the Positive Predictive Value ($PPV$) and the Negative Predictive Value ($NPV$).\n\n**1. Derivation of Positive Predictive Value ($PPV$)**\nThe $PPV$ is the probability that an individual has the disease given that they received a positive test result. Formally, this is the conditional probability $P(D | T^+)$.\nUsing the definition of conditional probability (Bayes' theorem):\n$$PPV = P(D | T^+) = \\frac{P(D \\cap T^+)}{P(T^+)}$$\nThe numerator represents the joint probability of having the disease and testing positive. It can be expressed as:\n$$P(D \\cap T^+) = P(T^+ | D) P(D) = Se \\cdot \\pi$$\nThe denominator, $P(T^+)$, is the total probability of receiving a positive test result in the population. We find this using the law of total probability, by summing over the two mutually exclusive states (having the disease or not having the disease):\n$$P(T^+) = P(T^+ \\cap D) + P(T^+ \\cap D^c)$$\n$$P(T^+) = P(T^+ | D) P(D) + P(T^+ | D^c) P(D^c)$$\nSubstituting the known terms:\n$$P(T^+) = (Se \\cdot \\pi) + ((1 - Sp) \\cdot (1 - \\pi))$$\nNow, we can assemble the final expression for $PPV$:\n$$PPV = \\frac{P(T^+ | D) P(D)}{P(T^+ | D) P(D) + P(T^+ | D^c) P(D^c)} = \\frac{Se \\cdot \\pi}{(Se \\cdot \\pi) + ((1 - Sp) \\cdot (1 - \\pi))}$$\n\n**2. Derivation of Negative Predictive Value ($NPV$)**\nThe $NPV$ is the probability that an individual does not have the disease given that they received a negative test result. Formally, this is the conditional probability $P(D^c | T^-)$.\nUsing the definition of conditional probability:\n$$NPV = P(D^c | T^-) = \\frac{P(D^c \\cap T^-)}{P(T^-)}$$\nThe numerator is the joint probability of not having the disease and testing negative:\n$$P(D^c \\cap T^-) = P(T^- | D^c) P(D^c) = Sp \\cdot (1 - \\pi)$$\nThe denominator, $P(T^-)$, is the total probability of receiving a negative test result. Using the law of total probability:\n$$P(T^-) = P(T^- \\cap D^c) + P(T^- \\cap D)$$\n$$P(T^-) = P(T^- | D^c) P(D^c) + P(T^- | D) P(D)$$\nSubstituting the known terms:\n$$P(T^-) = (Sp \\cdot (1 - \\pi)) + ((1 - Se) \\cdot \\pi)$$\nAssembling the final expression for $NPV$:\n$$NPV = \\frac{P(T^- | D^c) P(D^c)}{P(T^- | D^c) P(D^c) + P(T^- | D) P(D)} = \\frac{Sp \\cdot (1 - \\pi)}{(Sp \\cdot (1 - \\pi)) + ((1 - Se) \\cdot \\pi)}$$\n\n### Numerical Computation\nWe now substitute the given values: $Se=0.90$, $Sp=0.95$, and $\\pi=0.01$.\n\n**Computation of $PPV$:**\n$$PPV = \\frac{0.90 \\cdot 0.01}{(0.90 \\cdot 0.01) + ((1 - 0.95) \\cdot (1 - 0.01))}$$\n$$PPV = \\frac{0.009}{(0.009) + (0.05 \\cdot 0.99)}$$\n$$PPV = \\frac{0.009}{0.009 + 0.0495}$$\n$$PPV = \\frac{0.009}{0.0585} \\approx 0.15384615...$$\nRounding to four significant figures, $PPV = 0.1538$.\n\n**Computation of $NPV$:**\n$$NPV = \\frac{0.95 \\cdot (1 - 0.01)}{(0.95 \\cdot (1 - 0.01)) + ((1 - 0.90) \\cdot 0.01)}$$\n$$NPV = \\frac{0.95 \\cdot 0.99}{(0.95 \\cdot 0.99) + (0.10 \\cdot 0.01)}$$\n$$NPV = \\frac{0.9405}{0.9405 + 0.001}$$\n$$NPV = \\frac{0.9405}{0.9415} \\approx 0.99893786...$$\nRounding to four significant figures, $NPV = 0.9989$.\n\n### Interpretation\nThe calculated values of $PPV$ and $NPV$ have profound implications for clinical practice.\n\n-   **Positive Predictive Value ($PPV \\approx 0.1538$):** The $PPV$ is strikingly low. It signifies that for an individual from this average-risk population who receives a positive screening test result, the probability that they actually have the cancer is only about 15.4%. Conversely, there is an approximate 84.6% chance that the positive result is a false positive. This phenomenon is a direct mathematical consequence of applying a test with imperfect specificity to a population with low disease prevalence.\n    -   **Patient Counseling:** It is imperative for the clinician to explain that a positive screening test is not a diagnosis. It is a risk-stratification tool. The patient should be counseled that while their risk is now higher than the general population's, it is still far more likely that they do not have cancer. This communication is critical to manage patient anxiety and ensure adherence to follow-up.\n    -   **Downstream Diagnostics:** The low $PPV$ means that a large volume of confirmatory diagnostic procedures (e.g., biopsies, more advanced imaging) will be required. Specifically, the ratio of positive screens to true positive cases is $1/PPV \\approx 1/0.1538 \\approx 6.5$. For every $6.5$ individuals sent for confirmatory testing, only $1$ will be found to have the disease. The health system must have adequate capacity and resources to manage this large burden of follow-up testing on individuals who are, in fact, disease-free.\n\n-   **Negative Predictive Value ($NPV \\approx 0.9989$):** The $NPV$ is extremely high, approaching $1$. This indicates that for an individual receiving a negative test result, the probability that they are truly free of the disease is approximately 99.9%.\n    -   **Patient Counseling:** A negative result is highly reassuring. The clinician can confidently inform the patient that it is extremely unlikely they have the cancer. The patient can be advised to return to the standard screening interval appropriate for their risk profile.\n    -   **Downstream Diagnostics:** A negative result effectively rules out the disease in the screened individual. No further immediate diagnostic workup is warranted based on this test result, which avoids unnecessary procedures and costs for the vast majority of the screened population.\n\nIn summary, for a low-prevalence disease, an effective screening test must have a very high $NPV$ to provide reassurance, but even with good sensitivity and specificity, it will likely have a low $PPV$. This mandates careful patient communication and robust planning for confirmatory diagnostics.",

To reduce aggregate harm from false-positive test results, the program stratifies participants into two mutually exclusive protocol groups based on pre-enrollment risk assessment and site capabilities.

Express the final answer as a decimal number with no unit. Round your answer to four significant figures.",
            "solution": "The problem requires the derivation of an analytic expression for the population-average cumulative probability that a randomly selected participant experiences at least one false-positive result in $n$ rounds of screening, and then a numerical evaluation of this expression. The solution must be derived from first principles using the complement rule and independence.\n\nFirst, let us define the relevant events and parameters based on the problem statement.\nThe population of participants is stratified into two mutually exclusive groups:\n- Group 1: Standard protocol group. A proportion $w$ of participants are in this group.\n- Group 2: High-specificity protocol group. A proportion $1-w$ of participants are in this group.\n\nThe parameters are:\n- $w = 0.7$: Proportion of participants in Group 1.\n- $1-w = 0.3$: Proportion of participants in Group 2.\n- $p_1 = 0.10$: Per-screen false-positive probability for Group 1.\n- $p_2 = 0.05$: Per-screen false-positive probability for Group 2.\n- $n = 10$: Number of independent annual screening rounds.\n\nLet $A$ be the event that a randomly selected participant experiences at least one false-positive result in $n$ rounds. We want to find the probability of this event, $P(A)$.\nLet $G_1$ be the event that a randomly selected participant belongs to Group 1, and $G_2$ be the event that the participant belongs to Group 2. From the problem statement, we have:\n$$P(G_1) = w$$\n$$P(G_2) = 1 - w$$\n\nSince $G_1$ and $G_2$ form a partition of the sample space (they are mutually exclusive and exhaustive), we can use the law of total probability to find $P(A)$:\n$$P(A) = P(A|G_1) P(G_1) + P(A|G_2) P(G_2)$$\nwhere $P(A|G_1)$ is the conditional probability of event $A$ given the participant is in Group 1, and $P(A|G_2)$ is the conditional probability of event $A$ given the participant is in Group 2.\n\nThe problem requires us to use the complement rule. Let $A^c$ be the complement of event $A$. $A^c$ is the event that a participant experiences *zero* false-positive results in all $n$ rounds. The relationship between the probabilities is:\n$$P(A|G_i) = 1 - P(A^c|G_i) \\quad \\text{for } i \\in \\{1, 2\\}$$\n\nLet's calculate $P(A^c|G_1)$. This is the probability of having no false positives in $n$ rounds, given the participant is in Group 1. The probability of a false positive in any single round for a person in Group 1 is $p_1$. Therefore, the probability of *not* having a false positive (a negative result) in a single round is $1 - p_1$. Since the outcomes of the $n$ rounds are independent, the probability of having no false positives in all $n$ rounds is the product of the probabilities of having a negative result in each round:\n$$P(A^c|G_1) = (1 - p_1) \\times (1 - p_1) \\times \\dots \\times (1 - p_1) = (1 - p_1)^n$$\nUsing the complement rule, the probability of at least one false positive for a participant in Group 1 is:\n$$P(A|G_1) = 1 - (1 - p_1)^n$$\n\nSimilarly, for a participant in Group 2, the per-round false-positive probability is $p_2$. The probability of a negative result in a single round is $1 - p_2$. Due to independence across rounds, the probability of having no false positives in $n$ rounds is:\n$$P(A^c|G_2) = (1 - p_2)^n$$\nSo, the probability of at least one false positive for a participant in Group 2 is:\n$$P(A|G_2) = 1 - (1 - p_2)^n$$\n\nNow, we substitute these conditional probabilities back into the law of total probability equation. This yields the desired analytic expression for the population-average cumulative probability of at least one false positive:\n$$P(A) = \\left[1 - (1 - p_1)^n\\right] w + \\left[1 - (1 - p_2)^n\\right] (1 - w)$$\n\nThe final step is to evaluate this expression numerically using the given parameter values: $w = 0.7$, $p_1 = 0.10$, $p_2 = 0.05$, and $n = 10$.\nSubstituting the values:\n$$P(A) = \\left[1 - (1 - 0.10)^{10}\\right] (0.7) + \\left[1 - (1 - 0.05)^{10}\\right] (1 - 0.7)$$\n$$P(A) = \\left[1 - (0.90)^{10}\\right] (0.7) + \\left[1 - (0.95)^{10}\\right] (0.3)$$\nFirst, we calculate the values of the exponential terms:\n$$(0.90)^{10} \\approx 0.34867844$$\n$$(0.95)^{10} \\approx 0.59873694$$\nNext, we calculate the probabilities for each group:\n$$P(A|G_1) = 1 - (0.90)^{10} \\approx 1 - 0.34867844 = 0.65132156$$\n$$P(A|G_2) = 1 - (0.95)^{10} \\approx 1 - 0.59873694 = 0.40126306$$\nFinally, we compute the weighted average:\n$$P(A) \\approx (0.65132156)(0.7) + (0.40126306)(0.3)$$\n$$P(A) \\approx 0.45592509 + 0.12037892$$\n$$P(A) \\approx 0.57630401$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures.
