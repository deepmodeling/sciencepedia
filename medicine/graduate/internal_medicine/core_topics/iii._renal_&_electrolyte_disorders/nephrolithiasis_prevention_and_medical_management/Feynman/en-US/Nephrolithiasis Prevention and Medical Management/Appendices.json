            "problem": "A patient with recurrent nephrolithiasis seeks preventive strategies to reduce future stone formation. One well-tested approach is to increase urine output to dilute lithogenic solutes. Consider a clinically stable adult with normal renal function who aims to maintain a daily urine output of $2.5\\,\\mathrm{L}$. Their measured non-urine water losses (insensible losses from skin and lungs, plus minor stool loss) are $1.2\\,\\mathrm{L}$ per day. They consistently obtain $0.8\\,\\mathrm{L}$ per day of water from food and non-water beverages. Assume steady state with no net change in total body water, and neglect metabolic water production for the purpose of daily intake planning. Using conservation of mass for body water and starting from first principles, derive the required daily plain water intake $W$ (in $\\mathrm{L}/\\mathrm{day}$) that maintains the target urine output while preserving steady state body water. Then provide a justification, grounded in renal physiology and conservation of mass, of whether diuretic therapy could substitute for plain water intake to achieve the urine volume target.\n\nExpress the final numerical answer for the required daily plain water intake in liters per day and round to three significant figures. Your answer must be a single number.",
            "solution": "The problem is valid. It is scientifically grounded in the principle of conservation of mass and established renal physiology, is well-posed with sufficient data for a unique solution, and is expressed in objective, formal language. We will proceed with a two-part solution.\n\nPart 1: Calculation of Required Daily Plain Water Intake\n\nThe fundamental principle governing this problem is the conservation of mass, applied to body water. For a patient in a steady state, the total water input to the body must equal the total water output over a given period, typically $24$ hours. This ensures that the total body water volume remains constant.\n\nThe water balance equation can be written as:\n$$ \\text{Total Water In} = \\text{Total Water Out} $$\n\nThe components of water input are:\n1.  $W$: The required daily plain water intake in liters per day ($\\mathrm{L/day}$). This is the variable we must solve for.\n2.  $W_{\\text{food}}$: The water obtained from food and non-water beverages.\n3.  $W_{\\text{meta}}$: The water produced from metabolic processes. The problem states to neglect this component.\n\nThe components of water output are:\n1.  $V_{\\text{urine}}$: The daily urine output.\n2.  $L_{\\text{non-urine}}$: The non-urine water losses, which include insensible losses from skin and lungs, as well as fecal water loss.\n\nWith the negligible metabolic water production, the steady-state water balance equation is:\n$$ W + W_{\\text{food}} = V_{\\text{urine}} + L_{\\text{non-urine}} $$\n\nWe are given the following values from the problem statement:\n-   Target daily urine output, $V_{\\text{urine}} = 2.5 \\, \\mathrm{L/day}$\n-   Non-urine water losses, $L_{\\text{non-urine}} = 1.2 \\, \\mathrm{L/day}$\n-   Water from food and non-water beverages, $W_{\\text{food}} = 0.8 \\, \\mathrm{L/day}$\n\nWe can now solve for the required daily plain water intake, $W$. Rearranging the balance equation to isolate $W$:\n$$ W = V_{\\text{urine}} + L_{\\text{non-urine}} - W_{\\text{food}} $$\n\nSubstituting the given numerical values into the equation:\n$$ W = (2.5 \\, \\mathrm{L/day}) + (1.2 \\, \\mathrm{L/day}) - (0.8 \\, \\mathrm{L/day}) $$\n\nFirst, we sum the total water losses:\n$$ \\text{Total Water Out} = 2.5 + 1.2 = 3.7 \\, \\mathrm{L/day} $$\n\nNext, we subtract the water intake from food to determine the required intake from plain water:\n$$ W = 3.7 \\, \\mathrm{L/day} - 0.8 \\, \\mathrm{L/day} = 2.9 \\, \\mathrm{L/day} $$\n\nThe result is $2.9 \\, \\mathrm{L/day}$. The problem requires the answer rounded to three significant figures. Therefore, the required daily plain water intake is $2.90 \\, \\mathrm{L/day}$.\n\nPart 2: Justification Regarding Diuretic Therapy Substitution\n\nThe question asks whether diuretic therapy could substitute for plain water intake to achieve the target urine volume of $2.5 \\, \\mathrm{L/day}$. The answer, grounded in renal physiology and the principle of conservation of mass, is no. Diuretic therapy cannot substitute for adequate water intake to sustainably achieve a high urine output for stone prevention.\n\n1.  **Violation of Mass Balance and Steady State:** A diuretic is a pharmacologic agent that increases urine output (diuresis) by inhibiting the reabsorption of solutes and water in the renal tubules. If a patient takes a diuretic to force a urine output of $V_{\\text{urine}} = 2.5 \\, \\mathrm{L/day}$ but does not increase their water intake to compensate, the water balance equation becomes unbalanced. Using the values from the problem, if plain water intake $W$ were not increased from a baseline level (e.g., let's assume a baseline of $1.0 \\, \\mathrm{L/day}$), the total intake would be $1.0 + 0.8 = 1.8 \\, \\mathrm{L/day}$, while the total output would be $2.5 + 1.2 = 3.7 \\, \\mathrm{L/day}$. This creates a net water deficit of $1.9 \\, \\mathrm{L/day}$. Such a state is, by definition, not a steady state. The patient would experience progressive volume depletion (dehydration). Diuretics do not create water; they merely force the kidneys to excrete water already present in the body. Without replacement, this leads to a net loss of total body water.\n\n2.  **Physiological Goal of Dilution:** The primary therapeutic goal of increasing urine volume in nephrolithiasis prevention is to *dilute* the urine. This lowers the concentration (more accurately, the supersaturation) of lithogenic solutes such as calcium, oxalate, and uric acid, thereby reducing the driving force for crystal formation and growth. Increasing plain water intake directly achieves this goal by providing a surplus of free water for excretion, resulting in a large volume of dilute urine.\n\n3.  **Counter-Productive Effects of Dehydration:** A state of volume depletion induced by uncompensated diuretic use triggers powerful counter-regulatory physiological responses. The body would sense the dehydration and increase the secretion of antidiuretic hormone (ADH) and activate the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS). These hormones promote water and sodium retention, directly opposing the action of the diuretic and leading to the production of more concentrated urine. This would defeat the fundamental purpose of the therapy, which is to lower solute concentration.\n\nIn conclusion, a diuretic can force the kidneys to produce a certain volume of urine, but it cannot do so sustainably without an equivalent increase in fluid intake. Attempting to use a diuretic as a substitute for water intake would violate the principle of mass balance, lead to clinically significant dehydration, and trigger physiological responses that would ultimately subvert the goal of maintaining a dilute urine. Therefore, to achieve the target urine output while preserving a steady-state body water volume, any diuretic-induced water loss must be matched by increased fluid consumption. The diuretic prompts the excretion; the water intake provides the substance to be excreted.",

            "introduction": "Beyond simple dilution, managing the excretion of specific lithogenic solutes is key, especially for patients with recurrent calcium stones. A crucial, often underappreciated, relationship exists between dietary sodium and urinary calcium, linked by their shared transport mechanisms in the renal tubules. This practice  allows you to apply a quantitative model to predict how sodium restriction directly reduces calcium excretion, providing a clear rationale for this essential dietary intervention.",

            "problem": "A middle-aged individual with recurrent calcium oxalate nephrolithiasis is counseled on dietary sodium restriction to reduce urinary calcium excretion. In steady state, daily sodium intake equals daily urinary sodium excretion. Proximal tubular sodium reabsorption occurs iso-osmotically with water and establishes a lumen-positive transepithelial voltage in downstream segments that facilitates paracellular calcium reabsorption. Increased sodium intake expands extracellular volume, suppresses proximal sodium reabsorption, and reduces the driving forces for paracellular calcium reabsorption, thereby increasing urinary calcium excretion. Conversely, sodium restriction reverses these effects.\n\nAssume the following well-tested clinical observation that can be used as a modeling premise: for each change in daily urinary sodium excretion, daily urinary calcium excretion changes in the same direction according to a linear proportionality with coefficient $\\gamma$, where $\\gamma = 6.0 \\times 10^{-3}$ mmol calcium per mmol sodium. Daily sodium intake is reduced from $200$ mmol/day to $100$ mmol/day and the system is allowed to reach steady state.\n\nUsing the above physiologic base and the proportional assumption, compute the expected reduction in daily urinary calcium excretion in milligrams per day of elemental calcium. Use the atomic mass of calcium $M_{\\text{Ca}} = 40.078$ g/mol for conversion between millimoles and milligrams.

            "solution": "The problem is evaluated to be scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. All necessary data are provided, and the premises are consistent with established principles in renal physiology. The problem is valid and a solution can be derived.\n\nThe core of the problem lies in a stated linear relationship between the change in daily urinary sodium excretion and the change in daily urinary calcium excretion. We are asked to calculate the magnitude of the reduction in urinary calcium excretion, in units of milligrams per day, corresponding to a specified reduction in daily sodium intake.\n\nLet $\\Delta E_{\\text{Na}}$ denote the change in daily urinary sodium excretion and $\\Delta E_{\\text{Ca}}$ denote the change in daily urinary calcium excretion, both expressed in mmol/day. The problem provides the following linear proportionality:\n$$\n\\Delta E_{\\text{Ca}} = \\gamma \\cdot \\Delta E_{\\text{Na}}\n$$\nThe proportionality constant is given as $\\gamma = 6.0 \\times 10^{-3}$ (in units of mmol Ca per mmol Na).\n\nThe problem states that the individual is in a steady state, where daily sodium intake equals daily urinary sodium excretion. The daily sodium intake is reduced from an initial value, $I_{\\text{Na, initial}} = 200$ mmol/day, to a final value, $I_{\\text{Na, final}} = 100$ mmol/day.\n\nUnder the steady-state assumption, the initial and final urinary sodium excretion rates are:\n$$\nE_{\\text{Na, initial}} = I_{\\text{Na, initial}} = 200 \\, \\text{mmol/day}\n$$\n$$\nE_{\\text{Na, final}} = I_{\\text{Na, final}} = 100 \\, \\text{mmol/day}\n$$\n\nThe change in daily urinary sodium excretion, $\\Delta E_{\\text{Na}}$, is the final value minus the initial value:\n$$\n\\Delta E_{\\text{Na}} = E_{\\text{Na, final}} - E_{\\text{Na, initial}} = 100 \\, \\text{mmol/day} - 200 \\, \\text{mmol/day} = -100 \\, \\text{mmol/day}\n$$\nThe negative sign indicates a reduction, as expected.\n\nNow, we can calculate the corresponding change in daily urinary calcium excretion, $\\Delta E_{\\text{Ca}}$, using the given proportionality:\n$$\n\\Delta E_{\\text{Ca}} = \\gamma \\cdot \\Delta E_{\\text{Na}} = (6.0 \\times 10^{-3}) \\cdot (-100 \\, \\text{mmol/day}) = -0.6 \\, \\text{mmol/day}\n$$\nThe negative sign indicates a reduction in calcium excretion, which is consistent with the physiological premises. The magnitude of this reduction is $0.6$ mmol/day.\n\nThe problem requires this reduction to be expressed in milligrams per day. To perform this unit conversion, we use the atomic mass of elemental calcium, $M_{\\text{Ca}} = 40.078$ g/mol. This can be expressed in units more convenient for our calculation:\n$$\nM_{\\text{Ca}} = 40.078 \\, \\frac{\\text{g}}{\\text{mol}} = 40.078 \\, \\frac{\\text{mg}}{\\text{mmol}}\n$$\nThe reduction in the mass of excreted calcium per day, denoted as $\\Delta m_{\\text{Ca}}$, is the absolute value of the molar change multiplied by the molar mass:\n$$\n\\Delta m_{\\text{Ca}} = |\\Delta E_{\\text{Ca}}| \\times M_{\\text{Ca}}\n$$\n$$\n\\Delta m_{\\text{Ca}} = (0.6 \\, \\text{mmol/day}) \\times (40.078 \\, \\text{mg/mmol})\n$$\n$$\n\\Delta m_{\\text{Ca}} = 24.0468 \\, \\text{mg/day}\n$$\n\nFinally, the problem asks to round the answer to three significant figures.\n$$\n\\Delta m_{\\text{Ca}} \\approx 24.0 \\, \\text{mg/day}\n$$\nThus, the expected reduction in daily urinary calcium excretion is $24.0$ mg/day.",

It represents a standard application of acid-base equilibrium principles to a clinically relevant scenario in nephrology, specifically concerning the physicochemical basis for uric acid nephrolithiasis.\n\nThe objective is to derive an expression for the fraction of total uric acid present in its protonated form, $HA$, as a function of $pH$ and $pK_a$, and then to calculate this fraction for the given clinical data.\n\nLet $[HA]$ be the molar concentration of the protonated form of uric acid and $[A^{-}]$ be the molar concentration of the deprotonated form (the urate anion).
