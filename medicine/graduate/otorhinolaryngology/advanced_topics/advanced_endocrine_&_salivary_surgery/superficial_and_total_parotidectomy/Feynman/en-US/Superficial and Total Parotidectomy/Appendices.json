            "problem": "A surgeon planning a superficial parotidectomy aims to avoid iatrogenic injury to the facial nerve trunk when dissecting near the cartilaginous external auditory canal.

            "solution": "The problem statement will first be validated for scientific and logical integrity.\n\n### Step 1: Extract Givens\n- The true patient-specific distance between the facial nerve trunk and the cartilaginous external auditory canal is a random variable, denoted by $D$.\n- The distribution of $D$ is approximated by a Gaussian (normal) distribution.\n- The mean of the distribution is $\\mu = 12\\,\\mathrm{mm}$.\n- The standard deviation of the distribution is $\\sigma = 2\\,\\mathrm{mm}$.\n- A safety buffer is established to protect against anatomical realizations that are up to $k$ standard deviations below the mean.\n- The chosen number of standard deviations for the buffer is $k = 2$.\n- The task is to calculate the resulting safety margin in millimeters.\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\n1.  **Scientifically Grounded**: The problem is grounded in a valid medical and statistical context. The use of a Gaussian distribution to model biological variability is a standard and well-accepted method in biostatistics. The anatomical structures mentioned (facial nerve, parotid gland, external auditory canal) and the clinical scenario (parotidectomy) are legitimate topics in otorhinolaryngology. The provided numerical values for mean and standard deviation are anatomically plausible.\n2.  **Well-Posed**: The problem is well-posed. It provides a clear statistical model, all necessary parameters ($\\mu, \\sigma, k$), and a well-defined objective: to calculate a specific value based on these parameters. The term \"safety margin\" is unambiguously defined by the context as the value corresponding to $k$ standard deviations below the mean. A unique solution exists.\n3.  **Objective**: The problem is stated using objective, precise, and formal language. It is free from subjective claims or opinions.\n4.  **Completeness and Consistency**: The problem is self-contained and provides all the information required for a solution. The givens are consistent with each other.\n5.  **Realism and Feasibility**: The scenario is realistic. Calculating such safety margins is a practical application of statistics in surgical planning to minimize iatrogenic risks.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is deemed valid as it is scientifically sound, well-posed, objective, and complete. A solution will be derived.\n\n### Solution\nThe problem describes the distance $D$ between the facial nerve trunk and the cartilaginous external auditory canal as a random variable following a normal distribution, $D \\sim \\mathcal{N}(\\mu, \\sigma^2)$. The given parameters are the mean distance $\\mu = 12\\,\\mathrm{mm}$ and the standard deviation of the distance $\\sigma = 2\\,\\mathrm{mm}$.\n\nThe surgeon adopts a conservative safety strategy by defining a buffer. This buffer is designed to protect against anatomical variations where the actual distance is smaller than the average. Specifically, the strategy accounts for distances that are up to $k$ standard deviations below the mean. The problem specifies a two-standard-deviation buffer, so $k=2$.\n\nThe safety margin, let's denote it by $S$, is the threshold distance defined by this strategy. A distance value smaller than this margin would fall into the region of concern (i.e., less than $k$ standard deviations below the mean). Therefore, the safety margin itself is the value that is exactly $k$ standard deviations below the mean distance $\\mu$.\n\nThe calculation for this margin is given by the formula:\n$$S = \\mu - k\\sigma$$\n\nWe are given the following values:\n- Mean, $\\mu = 12\\,\\mathrm{mm}$\n- Standard deviation, $\\sigma = 2\\,\\mathrm{mm}$\n- Number of standard deviations, $k = 2$\n\nSubstituting these values into the formula for the safety margin $S$:\n$$S = 12 - (2 \\times 2)$$\n\nPerforming the arithmetic operation:\n$$S = 12 - 4$$\n$$S = 8$$\n\nThe resulting safety margin is $8\\,\\mathrm{mm}$. This means that distances below $8\\,\\mathrm{mm}$ are considered to be within the two-standard-deviation risk zone from the mean. The surgeon should maintain a distance greater than this margin to adhere to the specified safety strategy. The question asks for the safety margin itself, which is the calculated value of $8\\,\\mathrm{mm}$.",

            "introduction": "Effective surgical planning extends beyond static anatomical knowledge to incorporate the multiple sources of uncertainty inherent in the clinical workflow. A preoperative MRI measurement, for example, is subject to imaging errors, biological shifts in tissue position, and intraoperative deformation. This advanced practice  challenges you to synthesize these independent uncertainties into a single probabilistic model. You will calculate the likelihood of achieving a required surgical buffer, transforming a simple distance measurement into a sophisticated, data-driven risk assessment.",

            "problem": "In superficial and total parotidectomy, safe dissection around the facial nerve aims to preserve nerve function while achieving oncologically sound tumor removal. A widely used planning heuristic is to require that the actual minimum clearance between the tumor capsule and the facial nerve at the time of dissection is at least a predefined buffer. Consider a patient with a parotid gland lesion where high-resolution Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) reports a measured minimum distance of $3$ millimeters from the lesion capsule to the main trunk of the facial nerve. The surgical team plans a superficial parotidectomy provided that a $2$ millimeter dissection buffer can be achieved at the time of surgery.\n\nTo model uncertainty realistically, use the following assumptions:\n- The MRI measurement error $\\varepsilon_{m}$ is independent and normally distributed with mean $0$ and standard deviation $\\sigma_{m} = 0.8$ millimeters, that is $\\varepsilon_{m} \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0, \\sigma_{m}^{2})$.\n- The biologic and positional variability of the facial nerve relative to the MRI (nerve excursion) $\\delta_{n}$ is independent and normally distributed with mean $0$ and standard deviation $\\sigma_{n} = 0.6$ millimeters, that is $\\delta_{n} \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0, \\sigma_{n}^{2})$. A positive $\\delta_{n}$ increases the clearance and a negative $\\delta_{n}$ decreases it.\n- The intraoperative traction and tissue deformation that reduce clearance are modeled by $r$, independent and normally distributed with mean $\\mu_{r} = 0.5$ millimeters and standard deviation $\\sigma_{r} = 0.5$ millimeters, that is $r \\sim \\mathcal{N}(\\mu_{r}, \\sigma_{r}^{2})$. This quantity represents a reduction and thus subtracts from the clearance.\n\nAssume mutual independence of $\\varepsilon_{m}$, $\\delta_{n}$, and $r$. Let $D_{\\text{meas}} = 3$ millimeters denote the MRI-reported distance and let $B = 2$ millimeters denote the required buffer. Let $C$ denote the actual minimum clearance at the time of dissection. Using only these assumptions and standard properties of normally distributed variables, compute the probability $P(C \\geq B)$. Express the final probability as a dimensionless decimal rounded to four significant figures.",
            "solution": "The problem will first be validated for scientific and logical integrity.\n\n### Step 1: Extract Givens\n- MRI-reported minimum distance: $D_{\\text{meas}} = 3$ millimeters.\n- Required dissection buffer: $B = 2$ millimeters.\n- MRI measurement error: $\\varepsilon_{m} \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0, \\sigma_{m}^{2})$ with $\\sigma_{m} = 0.8$ millimeters.\n- Nerve excursion: $\\delta_{n} \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0, \\sigma_{n}^{2})$ with $\\sigma_{n} = 0.6$ millimeters.\n- Intraoperative clearance reduction: $r \\sim \\mathcal{N}(\\mu_{r}, \\sigma_{r}^{2})$ with $\\mu_{r} = 0.5$ millimeters and $\\sigma_{r} = 0.5$ millimeters.\n- The random variables $\\varepsilon_{m}$, $\\delta_{n}$, and $r$ are mutually independent.\n- $C$ is the actual minimum clearance at the time of dissection.\n- The objective is to compute the probability $P(C \\geq B)$.\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\nThe problem is scientifically grounded, employing standard statistical methods (normal distributions, linear combinations of random variables) to model a plausible real-world scenario in surgical planning. The use of normally distributed errors and variabilities is a common and accepted modeling technique in biostatistics and engineering. The problem is well-posed, providing all necessary parameters and relationships to define a unique mathematical solution. The language is objective and precise. The problem does not violate any scientific principles, is not based on false premises, and is not incomplete or contradictory.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is deemed valid. A solution will now be derived.\n\nThe actual minimum clearance, $C$, must be expressed as a function of the given quantities. The true anatomical distance, let us call it $D_{\\text{true}}$, is related to the measured distance $D_{\\text{meas}}$ by the measurement error $\\varepsilon_{m}$. We model this relationship as $D_{\\text{true}} = D_{\\text{meas}} - \\varepsilon_{m}$. The actual clearance $C$ during surgery is this true distance further modified by the nerve excursion $\\delta_{n}$ and the intraoperative reduction $r$. A positive $\\delta_{n}$ increases clearance, while $r$ represents a reduction. Therefore, the expression for $C$ is:\n$$C = D_{\\text{true}} + \\delta_{n} - r = (D_{\\text{meas}} - \\varepsilon_{m}) + \\delta_{n} - r$$\nSubstituting the constant value for $D_{\\text{meas}}$, we have:\n$$C = 3 - \\varepsilon_{m} + \\delta_{n} - r$$\nThe variable $C$ is a linear combination of independent normally distributed random variables ($\\varepsilon_{m}$, $\\delta_{n}$, and $r$) and a constant ($3$). The property of normal distributions states that a linear combination of independent normal variables is also normally distributed. We now determine the parameters of this distribution, its mean ($\\mu_{C}$) and variance ($\\sigma_{C}^{2}$).\n\nThe mean of $C$ is found using the linearity of the expectation operator:\n$$E[C] = \\mu_{C} = E[3 - \\varepsilon_{m} + \\delta_{n} - r]$$\n$$\\mu_{C} = E[3] - E[\\varepsilon_{m}] + E[\\delta_{n}] - E[r]$$\nThe given means are $E[\\varepsilon_{m}] = 0$, $E[\\delta_{n}] = 0$, and $E[r] = \\mu_{r} = 0.5$. The expectation of a constant is the constant itself.\n$$\\mu_{C} = 3 - 0 + 0 - 0.5 = 2.5 \\text{ millimeters}$$\nThe variance of $C$ is found using the properties of variance. Since $D_{\\text{meas}}=3$ is a constant, its variance is $0$. Because $\\varepsilon_{m}$, $\\delta_{n}$, and $r$ are mutually independent, the variance of their sum (or difference) is the sum of their variances:\n$$\\text{Var}(C) = \\sigma_{C}^{2} = \\text{Var}(3 - \\varepsilon_{m} + \\delta_{n} - r)$$\n$$\\sigma_{C}^{2} = \\text{Var}(-\\varepsilon_{m}) + \\text{Var}(\\delta_{n}) + \\text{Var}(-r)$$\nUsing the property $\\text{Var}(aX) = a^2 \\text{Var}(X)$:\n$$\\sigma_{C}^{2} = (-1)^{2}\\text{Var}(\\varepsilon_{m}) + (1)^{2}\\text{Var}(\\delta_{n}) + (-1)^{2}\\text{Var}(r)$$\n$$\\sigma_{C}^{2} = \\sigma_{m}^{2} + \\sigma_{n}^{2} + \\sigma_{r}^{2}$$\nSubstituting the given standard deviations: $\\sigma_{m} = 0.8$, $\\sigma_{n} = 0.6$, and $\\sigma_{r} = 0.5$.\n$$\\sigma_{C}^{2} = (0.8)^{2} + (0.6)^{2} + (0.5)^{2}$$\n$$\\sigma_{C}^{2} = 0.64 + 0.36 + 0.25 = 1.25 \\text{ millimeters}^2$$\nThus, the actual clearance $C$ follows a normal distribution $C \\sim \\mathcal{N}(\\mu_{C}, \\sigma_{C}^{2})$, which is $\\mathcal{N}(2.5, 1.25)$. The standard deviation of $C$ is $\\sigma_{C} = \\sqrt{1.25}$ millimeters.\n\nWe need to compute the probability that the actual clearance $C$ is greater than or equal to the required buffer $B=2$ millimeters, i.e., $P(C \\geq 2)$. To find this probability, we standardize the random variable $C$ by transforming it into a standard normal variable $Z \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0, 1)$, using the formula $Z = (C - \\mu_{C}) / \\sigma_{C}$.\n$$P(C \\geq 2) = P\\left(\\frac{C - \\mu_{C}}{\\sigma_{C}} \\geq \\frac{2 - \\mu_{C}}{\\sigma_{C}}\\right)$$\n$$P(C \\geq 2) = P\\left(Z \\geq \\frac{2 - 2.5}{\\sqrt{1.25}}\\right)$$\n$$P(C \\geq 2) = P\\left(Z \\geq \\frac{-0.5}{\\sqrt{1.25}}\\right)$$\nLet's compute the value of the z-score:\n$$z = \\frac{-0.5}{\\sqrt{1.25}} \\approx \\frac{-0.5}{1.118034} \\approx -0.447214$$\nThe probability is $P(Z \\geq -0.447214)$. Using the symmetry of the standard normal distribution, $P(Z \\geq -z) = P(Z \\leq z)$.\n$$P(Z \\geq -0.447214) = P(Z \\leq 0.447214)$$\nThis probability is the value of the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the standard normal distribution, denoted $\\Phi(z)$, evaluated at $z = 0.447214$.\n$$\\Phi(0.447214) \\approx 0.672643$$\nThe problem requires the final probability to be rounded to four significant figures.\n$$P(C \\geq 2) \\approx 0.6726$$",
