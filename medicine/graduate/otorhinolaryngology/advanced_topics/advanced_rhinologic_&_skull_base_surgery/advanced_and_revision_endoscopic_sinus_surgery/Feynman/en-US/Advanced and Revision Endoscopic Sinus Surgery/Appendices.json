            "problem": "An otorhinolaryngology fellow is planning a revision Endoscopic Sinus Surgery (ESS) and needs to quantify the depth of the lateral lamella to assess Keros classification of the olfactory fossa on coronal Computed Tomography (CT). Keros classification is based on the measured vertical height of the lateral lamella (the perpendicular distance from the cribriform plate plane to the ethmoid roof at the lateral lamella). The fellow is using a coronal multi-planar reformatted dataset that adheres to Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine (DICOM) conventions, with known pixel metrics. The DICOM in-plane pixel spacings and slice thickness are provided: row spacing $s_{r} = 0.49\\,\\mathrm{mm/pixel}$, column spacing $s_{c} = 0.45\\,\\mathrm{mm/pixel}$, and slice thickness $s_{z} = 0.60\\,\\mathrm{mm/slice}$. The coordinate axes of the coronal dataset are such that increasing row index corresponds to the inferior direction (superior-inferior axis), increasing column index corresponds to the patient’s left-to-right direction, and increasing slice index corresponds to the anterior direction.\n\nTo define the cribriform plate reference plane, three points are picked on the cribriform plate (medial and lateral edges plus a posterior anchor) in voxel coordinates $(r, c, z)$: \n$A = (400, 300, 120)$, \n$B = (400, 320, 120)$, and \n$C = (400, 300, 124)$. \nThe deepest point of the lateral lamella on the right side is identified at \n$L = (414, 318, 123)$.\n\nStarting from fundamental definitions of DICOM spatial scaling and three-dimensional Euclidean geometry, derive the measurement procedure for Keros classification on coronal CT as the perpendicular (shortest) distance from the point $L$ to the plane through $A$, $B$, and $C$, expressed in millimeters. Compute this lateral lamella depth using the provided pixel metrics and coordinates. Round your answer to four significant figures. Express the final depth in millimeters.",
            "solution": "The problem asks for the calculation of the depth of the lateral lamella of the olfactory fossa, for the purpose of Keros classification, based on voxel coordinates from a coronal Computed Tomography (CT) dataset. This depth is defined as the perpendicular distance from a point on the lateral lamella to the plane of the cribriform plate. The problem is well-posed, scientifically grounded, and contains all necessary information for a unique solution.\n\nFirst, we must establish a physical coordinate system in millimeters from the given voxel coordinates and DICOM pixel spacings. The voxel coordinates are given as a triplet $(r, c, z)$, where $r$ is the row index, $c$ is the column index, and $z$ is the slice index. The corresponding physical spacings are the row spacing $s_{r} = 0.49\\,\\mathrm{mm/pixel}$, the column spacing $s_{c} = 0.45\\,\\mathrm{mm/pixel}$, and the slice thickness $s_{z} = 0.60\\,\\mathrm{mm/slice}$.\n\nWe define a three-dimensional Cartesian coordinate system $(x_p, y_p, z_p)$ in millimeters. Based on the problem description, we can map the voxel indices to physical coordinates as follows:\n- The column index $c$ maps to the patient's left-to-right axis, which we align with the $x_p$-axis.\n- The row index $r$ maps to the superior-inferior axis, which we align with the $y_p$-axis.\n- The slice index $z$ maps to the anterior-posterior axis, which we align with the $z_p$-axis.\n\nThe transformation from a point $P_{v} = (r, c, z)$ in voxel space to a point $P_{p} = (x_p, y_p, z_p)$ in physical space is a direct scaling, assuming the origin of the voxel grid corresponds to the origin of the physical space. Since distance calculations are invariant under translation, we can proceed without loss of generality.\nThe transformation equations are:\n$x_p = c \\cdot s_c$\n$y_p = r \\cdot s_r$\n$z_p = z \\cdot s_z$\n\nThe given voxel coordinates are:\nPoints on the cribriform plate plane:\n$A_{v} = (400, 300, 120)$\n$B_{v} = (400, 320, 120)$\n$C_{v} = (400, 300, 124)$\nPoint on the lateral lamella:\n$L_{v} = (414, 318, 123)$\n\nApplying the transformation to convert these points into physical coordinates (in millimeters):\n$A_{p} = (300 \\cdot 0.45, 400 \\cdot 0.49, 120 \\cdot 0.60) = (135.0, 196.0, 72.0)$\n$B_{p} = (320 \\cdot 0.45, 400 \\cdot 0.49, 120 \\cdot 0.60) = (144.0, 196.0, 72.0)$\n$C_{p} = (300 \\cdot 0.45, 400 \\cdot 0.49, 124 \\cdot 0.60) = (135.0, 196.0, 74.4)$\n$L_{p} = (318 \\cdot 0.45, 414 \\cdot 0.49, 123 \\cdot 0.60) = (143.1, 202.86, 73.8)$\n\nThe next step is to determine the equation of the plane $\\mathcal{P}$ passing through the points $A_{p}$, $B_{p}$, and $C_{p}$. A plane can be defined by a point on the plane (e.g., $A_p$) and a normal vector $\\vec{n}$. The normal vector can be found by taking the cross product of two vectors lying within the plane. Let's define two such vectors, $\\vec{u}$ and $\\vec{v}$:\n$\\vec{u} = B_{p} - A_{p} = (144.0 - 135.0, 196.0 - 196.0, 72.0 - 72.0) = (9.0, 0, 0)$\n$\\vec{v} = C_{p} - A_{p} = (135.0 - 135.0, 196.0 - 196.0, 74.4 - 72.0) = (0, 0, 2.4)$\n\nThe normal vector $\\vec{n}$ is perpendicular to both $\\vec{u}$ and $\\vec{v}$:\n$\\vec{n} = \\vec{u} \\times \\vec{v} = \\begin{vmatrix} \\mathbf{i}  \\mathbf{j}  \\mathbf{k} \\\\ 9.0  0  0 \\\\ 0  0  2.4 \\end{vmatrix} = (0 \\cdot 2.4 - 0 \\cdot 0)\\mathbf{i} - (9.0 \\cdot 2.4 - 0 \\cdot 0)\\mathbf{j} + (9.0 \\cdot 0 - 0 \\cdot 0)\\mathbf{k}$\n$\\vec{n} = (0, -21.6, 0)$\n\nThe equation of the plane $\\mathcal{P}$ is given by $\\vec{n} \\cdot (\\vec{p} - A_p) = 0$, where $\\vec{p} = (x_p, y_p, z_p)$ is an arbitrary point on the plane.\n$(0, -21.6, 0) \\cdot (x_p - 135.0, y_p - 196.0, z_p - 72.0) = 0$\n$0 \\cdot (x_p - 135.0) - 21.6 \\cdot (y_p - 196.0) + 0 \\cdot (z_p - 72.0) = 0$\n$-21.6 \\cdot (y_p - 196.0) = 0$\nThis simplifies to $y_p - 196.0 = 0$, or $y_p = 196.0$.\nThis result is expected, as all three points $A_p, B_p, C_p$ share the same $y_p$-coordinate of $196.0$, defining a plane parallel to the $x_p z_p$-plane.\n\nThe problem now reduces to finding the perpendicular distance from the point $L_p = (143.1, 202.86, 73.8)$ to the plane $y_p = 196.0$. The formula for the distance $D$ from a point $(x_0, y_0, z_0)$ to a plane $ax_p + by_p + cz_p + d = 0$ is:\n$D = \\frac{|a x_0 + b y_0 + c z_0 + d|}{\\sqrt{a^2 + b^2 + c^2}}$\n\nFor the plane $0x_p + 1y_p + 0z_p - 196.0 = 0$ and the point $L_p$, we have $a=0, b=1, c=0, d=-196.0$, and $(x_0, y_0, z_0) = (143.1, 202.86, 73.8)$.\n$D = \\frac{|0 \\cdot (143.1) + 1 \\cdot (202.86) + 0 \\cdot (73.8) - 196.0|}{\\sqrt{0^2 + 1^2 + 0^2}}$\n$D = \\frac{|202.86 - 196.0|}{\\sqrt{1}} = |6.86| = 6.86$\n\nThe distance is $6.86$ mm. This calculation confirms that because the reference plane is horizontal (constant $y_p$ value), the perpendicular distance is simply the difference in the $y_p$-coordinates between the point and the plane.\n\nThis can also be computed directly from the voxel data, as the geometry of the problem is simplified by the alignment of the reference plane with a voxel grid plane. The $r$-coordinate of the cribriform plane is constant at $r_{plane} = 400$. The $r$-coordinate of the lateral lamella point is $r_L = 414$. The depth is the difference in their corresponding physical positions along the superior-inferior axis ($y_p$-axis).\nDepth $= (r_L - r_{plane}) \\cdot s_r = (414 - 400) \\cdot 0.49 = 14 \\cdot 0.49 = 6.86$ mm.\n\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures. The calculated value is $6.86$. To express this with four significant figures, we write $6.860$.\nThe final depth of the lateral lamella is $6.860$ mm.",

The scaling is determined by a dimensionless factor, given as $g$, which encapsulates the geometric configuration of the fiducial markers relative to the target's location.\n\nThe phrase \"scales with... via a dimensionless factor\" implies a direct multiplicative relationship.
