            "problem": "In preoperative planning for an endoscopic endonasal transsphenoidal approach to the sella and pituitary gland, the safety margin relative to the cavernous segment of the internal carotid arteries must be assessed by estimating the intercarotid distance at the level of the sellar floor. Computed Tomography (CT) imaging is obtained in axial and coronal planes. In the coronal plane at the sellar floor, the medial carotid protuberances are measured at $6$ mm from the patient midline on both the left and right sides. The axial and coronal reconstructions confirm that the nasal septum deviates $2$ mm to the left relative to the patient midline along the approach corridor.\n\nUsing only fundamental geometric definitions of distance in the coronal plane and the anatomical definition of the patient midline (coronal plane mediolateral axis origin), compute the intercarotid distance at the level of the sellar floor. Express your final distance in millimeters and round to three significant figures.",
            "solution": "The problem will first be validated for scientific and logical integrity.\n\n### Step 1: Extract Givens\nThe explicit data provided in the problem statement are:\n- The measurement plane is the coronal plane at the level of the sellar floor.\n- The medial protuberance of the left internal carotid artery is located $6$ mm from the patient midline.\n- The medial protuberance of the right internal carotid artery is located $6$ mm from the patient midline.\n- The nasal septum deviates $2$ mm to the left relative to the patient midline.\n- The patient midline is defined as the coronal plane mediolateral axis origin.\n- The quantity to be computed is the intercarotid distance at the sellar floor.\n- The final answer must be in millimeters and rounded to three significant figures.\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\nThe problem is evaluated against the specified criteria:\n- **Scientifically Grounded:** The problem uses standard anatomical terminology (sella, pituitary gland, cavernous segment of the internal carotid artery, nasal septum, patient midline) and imaging concepts (CT, axial and coronal planes) that are fundamental to neurosurgery and otorhinolaryngology. The provided measurements are anatomically realistic. The problem is scientifically sound.\n- **Well-Posed:** The problem asks for the distance between two points whose positions are clearly defined relative to a common reference (the patient midline). All information necessary to calculate this distance is provided. The objective is unambiguous. A unique solution exists.\n- **Objective:** The problem is stated in precise, quantitative, and objective language. It is free of subjective or opinion-based claims.\n- **Consistency and Completeness:** The problem is self-contained. The data regarding the positions of the carotid arteries are sufficient for the calculation. The information about the nasal septum's deviation is extraneous to the calculation of the distance *between the carotid arteries*, as their positions are specified relative to the patient midline, not the septum. This extraneous information serves as a distractor but does not create a contradiction or render the problem incomplete. Such distractors are common in evaluating a student's ability to identify relevant variables.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is deemed **valid**. It is a straightforward application of one-dimensional coordinate geometry within a realistic clinical context. The solution will now be derived.\n\n### Solution Derivation\nThe problem can be modeled on a one-dimensional coordinate axis, representing the mediolateral dimension in the coronal plane.\n\n1.  **Establish a Coordinate System:** Let the patient midline be the origin of our coordinate system, such that its position is $x_{midline} = 0$. We will adopt the standard convention where positions to the right of the midline are positive and positions to the left are negative.\n\n2.  **Define Positions of Anatomical Structures:**\n    - The medial protuberance of the right internal carotid artery is given as $6$ mm to the right of the midline. Its coordinate, $x_R$, is therefore $x_R = +6$ mm.\n    - The medial protuberance of the left internal carotid artery is given as $6$ mm to the left of the midline. Its coordinate, $x_L$, is therefore $x_L = -6$ mm.\n    - The nasal septum is stated to be deviated $2$ mm to the left of the midline. Its coordinate, $x_{septum}$, would be $x_{septum} = -2$ mm. This information is noted but is not required for the primary calculation, as the positions of the carotid arteries are defined independently of the septum.\n\n3.  **Calculate the Intercarotid Distance:** The intercarotid distance, which we will denote as $D_{IC}$, is the absolute difference between the coordinates of the right and left carotid protuberances. The formula for the distance between two points $x_1$ and $x_2$ on a line is $D = |x_2 - x_1|$.\n\n    Applying this a formula to our defined points:\n    $$D_{IC} = |x_R - x_L|$$\n\n4.  **Substitute Values and Compute:**\n    $$D_{IC} = |(+6 \\text{ mm}) - (-6 \\text{ mm})|$$\n    $$D_{IC} = |6 \\text{ mm} + 6 \\text{ mm}|$$\n    $$D_{IC} = |12 \\text{ mm}|$$\n    $$D_{IC} = 12 \\text{ mm}$$\n\n5.  **Final Formatting:** The problem requires the final answer to be expressed in millimeters and rounded to three significant figures. The calculated exact distance is $12$ mm. To express this value with three significant figures, we write it as $12.0$.\n\nThe final computed intercarotid distance at the level of the sellar floor is $12.0$ mm.",

It provides a clear, simplified model of a real-world clinical scenario with all necessary parameters to compute a unique solution.\n\nThe problem asks for the increase in linear arc coverage along a sellar meridian when switching from a $0^{\\circ}$ endoscope to a $30^{\\circ}$ endoscope. The geometry is modeled as a circular arc representing the sellar surface, with the endoscope tip at the center of the circle.\n\nFirst, let us define the given parameters using appropriate mathematical notation:\n- The working distance, which is the radius of the circular arc: $R = 15\\,\\mathrm{mm}$.\n- The total angular field of view of the endoscope: $\\alpha = 80^{\\circ}$.\n- The angle of the second endoscope's optical axis relative to the first: $\\theta = 30^{\\circ}$.\n\nWe will establish a coordinate system where the endoscope tip is at the origin.

The field of view remains $\\alpha = 80^{\\circ}$ and is symmetric about this new axis. The visible angular range for the $30^{\\circ}$ scope, denoted as $V_{30}$, is:\n$$V_{30} = \\left[30^{\\circ} - \\frac{80^{\\circ}}{2}, 30^{\\circ} + \\frac{80^{\\circ}}{2}\\right] = \\left[30^{\\circ} - 40^{\\circ}, 30^{\\circ} + 40^{\\circ}\\right] = \\left[-10^{\\circ}, +70^{\\circ}\\right]$$\nThe positive angular limit for the $30^{\\circ}$ scope is $\\phi_{30, \\text{max}} = +70^{\\circ}$.\n\nThe problem specifies to find the \"increase in linear arc coverage ... that becomes newly visible,\" further clarified as the \"additional forward-facing angular extent beyond the $0^{\\circ}$ scope’s positive angular limit.\" This corresponds to the difference between the maximum positive viewing angles of the two scopes.\n\nThe effective angular coverage gained, $\\Delta\\phi$, is the difference between the upper limit of the $30^{\\circ}$ scope's view and the upper limit of the $0^{\\circ}$ scope's view:\n$$\\Delta\\phi = \\phi_{30, \\text{max}} - \\phi_{0, \\text{max}} = 70^{\\circ} - 40^{\\circ} = 30^{\\circ}$$\nThis is the central angle that subtends the newly visible arc at the forward-facing edge.\n\nTo find the linear arc coverage, $\\Delta s$, we use the formula for the arc length of a circle, $s = R \\cdot \\phi_{\\text{rad}}$, where the angle must be in radians.

            "solution": "The problem asks for the change in serum sodium concentration resulting from a specified pure water loss in a patient, under the assumption that the total amount of major extracellular and intracellular solutes remains constant. The analysis begins with the fundamental relationship provided, which models the serum sodium concentration, denoted as $[\\mathrm{Na}]$, as a function of the total exchangeable sodium ($\\mathrm{Na}_e$) and potassium ($\\mathrm{K}_e$) distributed through the total body water ($\\mathrm{TBW}$).\n\nThe governing equation is given as:\n$$ [\\mathrm{Na}] \\approx \\frac{\\mathrm{Na}_e + \\mathrm{K}_e}{\\mathrm{TBW}} $$\nThis relationship is an application of the definition of concentration, where the numerator represents the total quantity of osmotically active solutes and the denominator represents the volume of solvent in which they are dissolved.\n\nLet $S_{total} = \\mathrm{Na}_e + \\mathrm{K}_e$ represent the total amount of these exchangeable solutes. The problem states that this quantity remains constant over the $24$-hour period of observation.
