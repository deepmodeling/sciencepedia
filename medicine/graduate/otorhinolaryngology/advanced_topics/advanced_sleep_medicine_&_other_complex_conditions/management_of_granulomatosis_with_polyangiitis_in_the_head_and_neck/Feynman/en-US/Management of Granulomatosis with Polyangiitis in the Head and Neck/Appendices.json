            "introduction": "The diagnosis of granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA) hinges on integrating clinical presentation, serology, and histopathology. This exercise simulates a classic presentation of destructive sinonasal disease with a positive PR3-ANCA, challenging you to construct a sound diagnostic and management algorithm. Mastering this process is crucial for accurately diagnosing GPA while systematically excluding critical mimics that require entirely different therapeutic approaches.",

            "problem": "A middle-aged individual presents with progressive nasal crusting, recurrent epistaxis, nasal obstruction, and a newly developed saddle-nose deformity. Nasal endoscopy reveals friable, ulcerated mucosa with septal perforation. Computed tomography (CT) of the paranasal sinuses demonstrates bony destruction of the turbinates and septum. Basic metabolic panel is within reference ranges, urinalysis reveals no dysmorphic erythrocytes or cellular casts, and a chest radiograph shows no parenchymal opacities. Indirect immunofluorescence (IIF) demonstrates a cytoplasmic anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (c-ANCA) pattern, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) confirms proteinase 3 anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (PR3-ANCA) at a high titer. The patient denies illicit drug use, although there is no corroborating collateral history. There is no fever, neutropenia, or severe facial pain to suggest fulminant invasive infection.\n\nUsing core definitions of test characteristics and clinical reasoning, construct a decision algorithm to interpret the PR3-ANCA result in this setting of destructive sinonasal disease and select the next steps in management from the options below. Your reasoning should be grounded in the following foundational principles: PR3-ANCA is a disease-associated autoantibody for granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA), with high specificity in the appropriate clinical context; sensitivity is lower in limited head-and-neck disease than in generalized disease; the post-test probability of disease depends on the pre-test probability via Bayes’ theorem; tissue biopsy remains the reference standard to confirm necrotizing granulomatous inflammation and exclude mimics; and urgent treatment should not be delayed when there is organ- or life-threatening disease.\n\nWhich option best reflects an appropriate algorithmic interpretation and next-step plan?\n\nA. Treat the positive PR3-ANCA as diagnostic of granulomatosis with polyangiitis without further evaluation; start cyclophosphamide plus high-dose systemic glucocorticoids immediately, schedule septal reconstruction during induction, and forego antimicrobial prophylaxis unless pulmonary disease later emerges.\n\nB. Apply Bayesian reasoning given the high pre-test probability conferred by destructive sinonasal disease: a positive PR3-ANCA markedly increases the likelihood of granulomatosis with polyangiitis, but proceed with targeted endoscopic biopsy from the active edge of the lesion to confirm necrotizing granulomatous vasculitis and to exclude mimics (request stains and immunohistochemistry for invasive fungi and Epstein–Barr virus to exclude extranodal natural killer/T-cell lymphoma, and order urine toxicology to assess for cocaine-associated midline destructive lesions). Concurrently stage for systemic involvement with urinalysis, serum creatinine, and chest imaging. In the absence of organ- or life-threatening manifestations, initiate induction with systemic glucocorticoids plus methotrexate or rituximab, institute topical nasal therapies, and defer reconstructive surgery until durable remission; add Pneumocystis jirovecii prophylaxis if using high-dose glucocorticoids in combination with rituximab or cyclophosphamide.\n\nC. Because PR3-ANCA may be falsely positive, ignore the result and manage as chronic bacterial sinusitis with prolonged oral antibiotics and topical decongestants; avoid biopsy to limit bleeding risk; repeat PR3-ANCA in approximately six months and reconsider immunosuppression only if titers rise.\n\nD. Assume cocaine-induced midline destructive lesions until proven otherwise; order urine toxicology and, if negative, proceed to sinonasal radiotherapy to ablate inflammatory tissue; reserve immunosuppression exclusively for later development of renal failure.\n\nE. Confirm PR3-ANCA by testing myeloperoxidase-ANCA; if myeloperoxidase-ANCA is negative while PR3-ANCA is positive, forgo biopsy and treat localized head-and-neck disease with antibiotics and topical steroids alone, because systemic immunosuppression is not indicated in localized granulomatosis with polyangiitis.",
            "solution": "Begin with core definitions. Proteinase 3 anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (PR3-ANCA) are autoantibodies strongly associated with granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA). In appropriate clinical contexts, PR3-ANCA demonstrates high specificity (on the order of approximately $90\\%$ to $95\\%$ against relevant differentials), with sensitivity that is higher in generalized disease and lower in limited head-and-neck disease. Indirect immunofluorescence (IIF) classically yields a cytoplasmic anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (c-ANCA) pattern in PR3-ANCA–positive GPA, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) confirms antigen specificity. However, anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies are not pathognomonic; false positives and disease mimics exist.\n\nBayes’ theorem provides the fundamental relationship between a test’s characteristics and clinical probability. If $P(D)$ denotes pre-test probability of disease and $LR^{+}$ denotes the positive likelihood ratio of the test, then the posterior odds equal the prior odds times the positive likelihood ratio:\n$$\n\\text{Posterior odds} = \\frac{P(D)}{1-P(D)} \\times LR^{+}.\n$$\nFor PR3-ANCA in the appropriate setting, $LR^{+}$ is substantially greater than $1$, so a positive test meaningfully increases the post-test probability. In a patient with destructive sinonasal disease, the pre-test probability of GPA is elevated. Therefore, a positive PR3-ANCA significantly supports GPA. Nevertheless, destructive sinonasal disease has important mimics that must be excluded because they mandate very different treatments and can also be associated with anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody reactivity. Key mimics include cocaine-associated midline destructive lesions, extranodal natural killer/T-cell lymphoma (Epstein–Barr virus–associated), and invasive fungal sinusitis. Thus, tissue confirmation remains essential when feasible and when there is no immediate organ- or life-threatening indication to treat without delay.\n\nThe reference standard for GPA is demonstration of necrotizing granulomatous inflammation and vasculitis on biopsy. In the sinonasal tract, the highest diagnostic yield comes from targeted endoscopic biopsy from the active edge of a lesion, with adequate depth. Concurrently, staging for systemic involvement (urinalysis for hematuria and casts, serum creatinine, and chest imaging) is necessary to classify disease severity, which guides induction therapy. Induction regimens are stratified by severity: in non–organ-threatening disease confined to the head and neck, systemic glucocorticoids combined with a non-alkylating agent such as methotrexate or a B-cell–depleting agent such as rituximab are appropriate; in organ- or life-threatening disease (for example, rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis, alveolar hemorrhage, or threatened vision), cyclophosphamide or rituximab with high-dose glucocorticoids is indicated. Pneumocystis jirovecii prophylaxis should be added when using high-dose systemic glucocorticoids with cyclophosphamide or rituximab. Otorhinolaryngology-specific care includes saline irrigations, topical intranasal corticosteroids, and cautious debridement, while reconstructive surgery (for example, septorhinoplasty) should be deferred until durable remission to limit failure risk. For mimic exclusion, a urine toxicology screen for cocaine and biopsy studies including fungal stains and Epstein–Barr virus–encoded RNA in situ hybridization are critical.\n\nOption-by-option analysis:\n\nA. This option treats a positive PR3-ANCA as definitively diagnostic, bypasses biopsy and mimic exclusion, commits to cyclophosphamide regardless of severity, schedules reconstructive surgery during active disease, and omits Pneumocystis jirovecii prophylaxis. This approach ignores the foundational principle that post-test probability, while high, does not eliminate important mimics requiring distinct therapy, violates severity-based stratification, and advances surgery in active inflammation, which is associated with poor outcomes. Verdict — Incorrect.\n\nB. This option explicitly applies Bayesian reasoning: with high pre-test probability, a positive PR3-ANCA substantially increases the likelihood of GPA, but it still requires tissue confirmation and deliberate exclusion of mimics (cocaine-associated lesions, extranodal natural killer/T-cell lymphoma via Epstein–Barr virus testing, invasive fungal sinusitis via stains and cultures). It stages systemic involvement to classify severity, then selects induction based on the absence of organ- or life-threatening disease (glucocorticoids plus methotrexate or rituximab), integrates topical sinonasal care, defers reconstructive surgery until remission, and employs Pneumocystis jirovecii prophylaxis when using high-dose glucocorticoids with rituximab or cyclophosphamide. This aligns with the core principles of test interpretation, tissue diagnosis, mimic exclusion, and severity-tailored management. Verdict — Correct.\n\nC. This option discards a disease-associated autoantibody with high specificity in the appropriate context, defaults to antibiotics and decongestants, and delays definitive diagnosis by avoiding biopsy. It fails the fundamental requirement to integrate test characteristics with pre-test probability and to pursue tissue confirmation in destructive sinonasal disease. Verdict — Incorrect.\n\nD. This option presumes a single mimic as the default diagnosis and proposes radiotherapy for sinonasal inflammation, which is not appropriate for GPA or cocaine-associated lesions. It withholds immunosuppression until renal failure emerges, neglecting the morbidity of ongoing destructive disease and airway manifestations. Verdict — Incorrect.\n\nE. This option proposes confirmation by myeloperoxidase-ANCA, which is not the appropriate confirmatory step for PR3-ANCA; it then forgoes biopsy if PR3-ANCA is positive and minimizes therapy to topical and antibiotic measures, contrary to evidence that localized GPA usually requires systemic immunosuppression to control destructive inflammation. It also ignores mimic exclusion. Verdict — Incorrect.\n\nTherefore, the algorithm that best interprets PR3-ANCA positivity in destructive sinonasal disease and outlines appropriate next steps is the one described in option B.",

An otorhinolaryngology-led multidisciplinary team selects rituximab for induction according to the well-tested regimen of $375\\ \\mathrm{mg/m^2}$ given weekly for $4$ doses, combined with systemic glucocorticoids. Individualized dosing for rituximab is commonly based on body surface area (BSA) using the Mosteller formula, a validated allometric scaling relation for drug dosing: \n$$\n\\mathrm{BSA}=\\sqrt{\\frac{h \\times w}{3600}},\n$$\nwhere $h$ is the height in $\\mathrm{cm}$ and $w$ is the weight in $\\mathrm{kg}$.

Express the final answer in grams, and round the final answer to $3$ significant figures.",
            "solution": "The calculation proceeds in several steps:\n1.  Convert the patient's height and weight from imperial units to the metric units required by the Mosteller formula.\n2.  Calculate the patient's body surface area (BSA) using the given formula.\n3.  Calculate the mass of rituximab for a single dose based on the BSA.\n4.  Calculate the total mass required for the full course of therapy.\n5.  Convert the final mass to grams and round to the specified number of significant figures.\n\n**Step 1: Convert Height and Weight to Metric Units**\n\nFirst, the patient's height is converted from feet and inches to centimeters. The patient's height is given as $5$ feet $9$ inches.\nUsing the conversion $1\\ \\mathrm{ft} = 12\\ \\mathrm{in}$, the total height in inches is:\n$$\nh_{\\mathrm{inches}} = (5 \\times 12) + 9 = 60 + 9 = 69\\ \\mathrm{in}\n$$\nUsing the conversion factor $1\\ \\mathrm{in} = 2.54\\ \\mathrm{cm}$, the height $h$ in centimeters is:\n$$\nh = 69\\ \\mathrm{in} \\times 2.54\\ \\frac{\\mathrm{cm}}{\\mathrm{in}} = 175.26\\ \\mathrm{cm}\n$$\nNext, the patient's weight is converted from pounds to kilograms. The patient's weight is given as $154$ pounds.\nUsing the conversion factor $1\\ \\mathrm{lb} = 0.45359237\\ \\mathrm{kg}$, the weight $w$ in kilograms is:\n$$\nw = 154\\ \\mathrm{lb} \\times 0.45359237\\ \\frac{\\mathrm{kg}}{\\mathrm{lb}} = 69.85322498\\ \\mathrm{kg}\n$$\nAs per the problem instructions, we will carry intermediate calculations to at least $6$ significant figures. We will use $w \\approx 69.8532\\ \\mathrm{kg}$ for clarity in the steps, but the full precision value will be used in the calculator to prevent rounding errors.\n\n**Step 2: Calculate Body Surface Area (BSA)**\n\nThe Mosteller formula for BSA in $\\mathrm{m^2}$ is given as:\n$$\n\\mathrm{BSA} = \\sqrt{\\frac{h \\times w}{3600}}\n$$\nwhere $h$ is in $\\mathrm{cm}$ and $w$ is in $\\mathrm{kg}$.

The mass for a single dose, $M_{\\mathrm{single}}$, is the product of the BSA and the dosage per unit area.\n$$\nM_{\\mathrm{single}} = \\mathrm{BSA} \\times 375\\ \\frac{\\mathrm{mg}}{\\mathrm{m^2}}\n$$\n$$\nM_{\\mathrm{single}} = 1.84409615\\ \\mathrm{m^2} \\times 375\\ \\frac{\\mathrm{mg}}{\\mathrm{m^2}} \\approx 691.536056\\ \\mathrm{mg}\n$$\nCarrying at least $6$ significant figures, we have $M_{\\mathrm{single}} \\approx 691.536\\ \\mathrm{mg}$.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate Total Mass for the Induction Plan**\n\nThe induction plan consists of $4$ weekly doses. The total mass of rituximab, $M_{\\mathrm{total}}$, is $4$ times the single-dose mass.\n$$\nM_{\\mathrm{total}} = M_{\\mathrm{single}} \\times 4\n$$\n$$\nM_{\\mathrm{total}} = 691.536056\\ \\mathrm{mg} \\times 4 = 2766.14422\\ \\mathrm{mg}\n$$\n\n**Step 5: Convert to Grams and Round**\n\nThe final answer must be expressed in grams. We use the conversion $1\\ \\mathrm{g} = 1000\\ \\mathrm{mg}$.\n$$\nM_{\\mathrm{total, g}} = \\frac{2766.14422\\ \\mathrm{mg}}{1000\\ \\mathrm{mg/g}} = 2.76614422\\ \\mathrm{g}\n$$\nFinally, the problem requires rounding the final answer to $3$ significant figures. The first three significant figures are $2$, $7$, and $6$. The fourth significant figure is $6$, which is $5$ or greater, so we round up the third significant figure.\n$$\nM_{\\mathrm{final}} \\approx 2.77\\ \\mathrm{g}\n$$",

            "introduction": "Many patients with GPA require long-term glucocorticoid therapy, which can lead to suppression of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. When these patients require surgery, such as for the correction of subglottic stenosis, proper perioperative steroid management is critical to prevent a life-threatening adrenal crisis.

The patient has been on chronic oral prednisone for airway disease control for the past $6$ months. The hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal (HPA) axis is therefore presumed suppressed based on well-tested clinical observations that chronic exogenous glucocorticoid administration reduces endogenous cortisol production in response to surgical stress.

This total dose is composed of an initial induction dose and subsequent periodic doses.\n\nThe induction dose of hydrocortisone is given as:\n$$D_{H, \\text{ind}} = 100\\ \\mathrm{mg}$$\n\nFollowing the induction dose, hydrocortisone is administered at a dose of $D_{H, \\text{post}} = 50\\ \\mathrm{mg}$ every $\\Delta t = 8$ hours for a total duration of $T = 24$ hours.
