A solution will now be derived from first principles.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe analysis begins with the definition of the Apnea-Hypopnea Index (AHI). Let $N$ be the total number of apnea and hypopnea events and $T$ be the total sleep time in hours. The overall AHI is given by:\n$$AHI_{overall} = \\frac{N}{T}$$\nThe total sleep time $T$ and the total number of events $N$ can be partitioned based on sleep position: supine (subscript $s$) and nonsupine (subscript $ns$).\n$$T = T_s + T_{ns}$$\n$$N = N_s + N_{ns}$$\nHere, $T_s$ and $T_{ns}$ are the times spent in the supine and nonsupine positions, respectively, and $N_s$ and $N_{ns}$ are the number of events in each position.\n\nThe position-specific AHI values are defined as:\n$$AHI_s = \\frac{N_s}{T_s} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad AHI_{ns} = \\frac{N_{ns}}{T_{ns}}$$\nFrom these definitions, the number of events in each position can be expressed as:\n$$N_s = AHI_s \\cdot T_s$$\n$$N_{ns} = AHI_{ns} \\cdot T_{ns}$$\nSubstituting these expressions for $N_s$ and $N_{ns}$ into the equation for the total number of events $N$ gives:\n$$N = AHI_s \\cdot T_s + AHI_{ns} \\cdot T_{ns}$$\nNow, substituting this expression for $N$ into the definition of the overall AHI:\n$$AHI_{overall} = \\frac{AHI_s \\cdot T_s + AHI_{ns} \\cdot T_{ns}}{T}$$\nThis expression can be rewritten by separating the terms:\n$$AHI_{overall} = AHI_s \\left(\\frac{T_s}{T}\\right) + AHI_{ns} \\left(\\frac{T_{ns}}{T}\\right)$$\nThe terms $\\frac{T_s}{T}$ and $\\frac{T_{ns}}{T}$ are the fractions of total sleep time spent in the supine and nonsupine positions, which are denoted as $f_s$ and $f_{ns}$, respectively. The derived formula for the overall AHI is a weighted average of the positional AHIs:\n$$AHI_{overall} = AHI_s \\cdot f_s + AHI_{ns} \\cdot f_{ns}$$\nThis formula is derived from first principles as required.\n\n**Calculation of Preoperative Overall AHI**\nUsing the provided preoperative data:\n$AHI_{s, pre} = 60$\n$AHI_{ns, pre} = 10$\n$f_s = 0.40$\n$f_{ns} = 1 - 0.40 = 0.60$\n\nThe preoperative overall AHI, $AHI_{overall, pre}$, is:\n$$AHI_{overall, pre} = (AHI_{s, pre} \\cdot f_s) + (AHI_{ns, pre} \\cdot f_{ns})$$\n$$AHI_{overall, pre} = (60 \\cdot 0.40) + (10 \\cdot 0.60)$$\n$$AHI_{overall, pre} = 24 + 6 = 30$$\nThe preoperative overall AHI is $30$ events/hour.\n\n**Calculation of Postoperative Overall AHI**\nThe surgery is expected to halve the supine AHI and leave the nonsupine AHI unchanged. The sleep position fractions are assumed to remain constant.\nPostoperative supine AHI:\n$$AHI_{s, post} = \\frac{1}{2} AHI_{s, pre} = \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot 60 = 30$$\nPostoperative nonsupine AHI:\n$$AHI_{ns, post} = AHI_{ns, pre} = 10$$\nThe postoperative overall AHI, $AHI_{overall, post}$, is calculated using the same weighted average formula:\n$$AHI_{overall, post} = (AHI_{s, post} \\cdot f_s) + (AHI_{ns, post} \\cdot f_{ns})$$\n$$AHI_{overall, post} = (30 \\cdot 0.40) + (10 \\cdot 0.60)$$\n$$AHI_{overall, post} = 12 + 6 = 18$$\nThe expected postoperative AHI is $18$ events/hour.\n\n**Calculation of the Expected Reduction in Overall AHI**\nThe expected reduction is the difference between the preoperative and postoperative overall AHI values.\n$$\\text{Reduction} = AHI_{overall, pre} - AHI_{overall, post}$$\n$$\\text{Reduction} = 30 - 18 = 12$$\nAlternatively, the reduction can be calculated directly from the change in the supine component, as the nonsupine component is unchanged:\n$$\\text{Reduction} = (AHI_{s, pre} \\cdot f_s + AHI_{ns, pre} \\cdot f_{ns}) - (AHI_{s, post} \\cdot f_s + AHI_{ns, post} \\cdot f_{ns})$$\nSince $AHI_{ns, pre} = AHI_{ns, post}$, the terms involving $f_{ns}$ cancel out:\n$$\\text{Reduction} = (AHI_{s, pre} - AHI_{s, post}) \\cdot f_s$$\n$$\\text{Reduction} = (60 - 30) \\cdot 0.40$$\n$$\\text{Reduction} = 30 \\cdot 0.40 = 12$$\nThe expected reduction in the overall AHI is $12$ events/hour.",

The parameters provided, such as tongue volume, compliance, and critical closing pressure ($P_{\\text{crit}}$), are within physiologically plausible ranges for patients with OSA. The core concept—that surgically increasing airway dimensions will lower its collapsibility (i.e., reduce $P_{\\text{crit}}$)—is the fundamental rationale for such surgical interventions. The model is a valid, albeit simplified, application of fluid mechanics and biomechanics principles to a clinical problem.\n-   **Well-Posed:** The problem is self-contained and provides all necessary quantitative data and definitions to calculate the desired quantity, the postoperative $P_{\\text{crit}}$. The relationships between volume, area, length, and compliance are explicitly defined or follow from fundamental principles, allowing for the determination of a unique solution.\n-   **Objective:** The problem is stated using precise, quantitative, and unbiased technical language. It is free from subjective claims or opinions.\n\nThe problem does not exhibit any of the listed flaws (e.g., scientific unsoundness, missing information, unrealistic conditions).\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is deemed **valid**. A solution will be derived.\n\n**Solution Derivation**\n\nThe objective is to calculate the postoperative passive critical closing pressure, $P_{\\text{crit, post}}$. This can be determined by calculating the change in $P_{\\text{crit}}$ resulting from the surgical procedure. The derivation proceeds in a series of logical steps.\n\nFirst, we calculate the volume of tongue base tissue that is resected. The initial volume is $V_{\\text{tongue, pre}} = 30\\,\\mathrm{cm}^3$ and the resection percentage is $R = 0.25$. The resected volume, $\\Delta V_{\\text{tongue}}$, is:\n$$\n\\Delta V_{\\text{tongue}} = V_{\\text{tongue, pre}} \\times R = (30\\,\\mathrm{cm}^3) \\times 0.25 = 7.5\\,\\mathrm{cm}^3\n$$\n\nSecond, we determine the increase in the retroglossal airway volume, $\\Delta V_{\\text{airway}}$. The coupling efficiency, $\\eta = 0.40$, represents the fraction of the resected tissue volume that translates into an actual increase in airway volume.\n$$\n\\Delta V_{\\text{airway}} = \\eta \\times \\Delta V_{\\text{tongue}} = 0.40 \\times 7.5\\,\\mathrm{cm}^3 = 3.0\\,\\mathrm{cm}^3\n$$\n\nThird, we calculate the corresponding increase in the cross-sectional area of the airway, $\\Delta A$. The problem states that this volumetric gain is uniformly distributed over a retroglossal segment of effective length $L = 3.0\\,\\mathrm{cm}$. The volume of this segment is its cross-sectional area multiplied by its length. Therefore, the change in volume is related to the change in area by:\n$$\n\\Delta V_{\\text{airway}} = \\Delta A \\times L\n$$\nSolving for $\\Delta A$:\n$$\n\\Delta A = \\frac{\\Delta V_{\\text{airway}}}{L} = \\frac{3.0\\,\\mathrm{cm}^3}{3.0\\,\\mathrm{cm}} = 1.0\\,\\mathrm{cm}^2\n$$\n\nFourth, we use the definition of area–pressure compliance to find the change in pressure associated with this change in area. The compliance, $C$, is given as $C = 0.25\\,\\mathrm{cm}^2/\\mathrm{cm\\,H_2O}$. The problem specifies an approximately linear area–pressure relationship, which allows us to define compliance as the ratio of the change in area to the change in transmural pressure, $\\Delta P_{\\text{transmural}}$:\n$$\nC = \\frac{\\Delta A}{\\Delta P_{\\text{transmural}}}\n$$\nThe critical closing pressure, $P_{\\text{crit}}$, is the external pressure at which the airway collapses under passive conditions (zero intraluminal pressure). An increase in the airway's intrinsic size (i.e., an increase in $\\Delta A$ at a given pressure) means that the airway is now less prone to collapse. Consequently, the external pressure required to cause collapse is lower. The change in $P_{\\text{crit}}$ is therefore equal in magnitude but opposite in sign to the calculated change in transmural pressure required to effect the area change $\\Delta A$. The shift in the pressure-area curve, $\\Delta P$, represents this magnitude.\n$$\n\\Delta P = \\frac{\\Delta A}{C} = \\frac{1.0\\,\\mathrm{cm}^2}{0.25\\,\\mathrm{cm}^2/\\mathrm{cm\\,H_2O}} = 4.0\\,\\mathrm{cm\\,H_2O}\n$$\nA positive $\\Delta A$ (airway enlargement) leads to a decrease in $P_{\\text{crit}}$. Thus, the change in critical pressure, $\\Delta P_{\\text{crit}}$, is:\n$$\n\\Delta P_{\\text{crit}} = - \\Delta P = -4.0\\,\\mathrm{cm\\,H_2O}\n$$\n\nFinally, the postoperative critical closing pressure, $P_{\\text{crit, post}}$, is the sum of the preoperative pressure and the change induced by the surgery:\n$$\nP_{\\text{crit, post}} = P_{\\text{crit, pre}} + \\Delta P_{\\text{crit}}\n$$\nSubstituting the known values:\n$$\nP_{\\text{crit, post}} = 2.0\\,\\mathrm{cm\\,H_2O} + (-4.0\\,\\mathrm{cm\\,H_2O}) = -2.0\\,\\mathrm{cm\\,H_2O}\n$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to three significant figures.\n$$\nP_{\\text{crit, post}} = -2.00\\,\\mathrm{cm\\,H_2O}\n$$",
