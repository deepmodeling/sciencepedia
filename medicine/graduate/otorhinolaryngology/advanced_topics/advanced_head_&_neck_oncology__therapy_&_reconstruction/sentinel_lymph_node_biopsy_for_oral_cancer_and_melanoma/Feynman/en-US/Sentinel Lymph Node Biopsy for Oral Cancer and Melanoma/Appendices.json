            "problem": "A patient with early oral cavity squamous cell carcinoma is scheduled for sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB). A technetium-99m (Tc-99m) sulfur colloid radiotracer is injected peritumorally at $10{:}00$ with initial activity $A_0 = 0.4\\ \\mathrm{mCi}$. The incision is made at $15{:}30$. The physical half-life of technetium-99m is $T_{1/2} = 6.01\\ \\mathrm{h}$. Starting from the fundamental definition of radioactive decay as a first-order process and the definition of half-life (the time at which activity is reduced to one-half), derive an expression for the activity $A(t)$ as a function of time $t$ after injection. Then, compute the activity present at the time of incision. Express your final numerical activity in $\\mathrm{mCi}$ and round your answer to $3$ significant figures.\n\nIn addition, briefly discuss appropriate operating room (OR) staff precautions during SLNB for oral cancer or melanoma using technetium-99m, referencing the time–distance–shielding principle and contamination control, and justify them based on the calculated activity.",
            "solution": "The problem is evaluated as valid, as it is scientifically grounded in the principles of nuclear physics and its application in medicine, is well-posed with all necessary data provided, and is formulated objectively. The problem will be solved in two parts: a quantitative derivation and calculation, followed by a qualitative discussion of safety procedures.\n\nPart 1: Quantitative Analysis of Radioactive Decay\n\nThe fundamental principle of radioactive decay is that the rate of decay of a population of radioactive nuclei is directly proportional to the number of nuclei, $N(t)$, present at time $t$. This is a first-order kinetic process and can be expressed as a differential equation:\n$$\n\\frac{dN(t)}{dt} = -\\lambda N(t)\n$$\nwhere $\\lambda$ is the decay constant, a positive value characteristic of the specific radionuclide. The negative sign indicates that the number of radioactive nuclei decreases with time.\n\nTo solve this differential equation, we use the method of separation of variables:\n$$\n\\frac{dN(t)}{N(t)} = -\\lambda dt\n$$\nWe integrate this equation from time $t=0$ to a later time $t$. At $t=0$, the initial number of nuclei is $N_0$. At time $t$, the number of nuclei is $N(t)$.\n$$\n\\int_{N_0}^{N(t)} \\frac{1}{N} dN = \\int_{0}^{t} -\\lambda d\\tau\n$$\nThe integration yields:\n$$\n[\\ln(N)]_{N_0}^{N(t)} = [-\\lambda\\tau]_{0}^{t}\n$$\n$$\n\\ln(N(t)) - \\ln(N_0) = -\\lambda t\n$$\nUsing the properties of logarithms, this becomes:\n$$\n\\ln\\left(\\frac{N(t)}{N_0}\\right) = -\\lambda t\n$$\nExponentiating both sides with base $e$ gives the law of radioactive decay for the number of nuclei:\n$$\nN(t) = N_0 \\exp(-\\lambda t)\n$$\nThe activity, $A(t)$, of a radioactive sample is defined as the rate of decay, $A(t) = |\\frac{dN}{dt}| = \\lambda N(t)$. Therefore, the activity is also directly proportional to the number of radioactive nuclei. Thus, the activity at time $t$ follows the same exponential decay law:\n$$\nA(t) = A_0 \\exp(-\\lambda t)\n$$\nwhere $A_0$ is the initial activity at $t=0$.\n\nThe problem defines the half-life, $T_{1/2}$, as the time at which the activity is reduced to one-half of its initial value. We can use this definition to relate the half-life to the decay constant. At $t = T_{1/2}$, we have $A(T_{1/2}) = \\frac{A_0}{2}$. Substituting this into the decay equation:\n$$\n\\frac{A_0}{2} = A_0 \\exp(-\\lambda T_{1/2})\n$$\nDividing by $A_0$ (which is non-zero):\n$$\n\\frac{1}{2} = \\exp(-\\lambda T_{1/2})\n$$\nTaking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n$$\n\\ln\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) = -\\lambda T_{1/2}\n$$\nSince $\\ln(\\frac{1}{2}) = -\\ln(2)$, we have:\n$$\n-\\ln(2) = -\\lambda T_{1/2}\n$$\nSolving for the decay constant $\\lambda$ yields:\n$$\n\\lambda = \\frac{\\ln(2)}{T_{1/2}}\n$$\nSubstituting this expression for $\\lambda$ back into the activity decay equation gives the desired expression for $A(t)$ in terms of the half-life:\n$$\nA(t) = A_0 \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\ln(2)}{T_{1/2}} t\\right)\n$$\nThis is the derived expression for activity as a function of time.\n\nNow, we apply this to the specific values given in the problem.\nThe initial activity is $A_0 = 0.4\\ \\mathrm{mCi}$.\nThe half-life of technetium-99m is $T_{1/2} = 6.01\\ \\mathrm{h}$.\nThe radiotracer is injected at $10{:}00$ and the incision is made at $15{:}30$. The elapsed time, $t$, is the difference between these two times:\n$$\nt = 15.5\\ \\mathrm{h} - 10.0\\ \\mathrm{h} = 5.5\\ \\mathrm{h}\n$$\nNow we compute the activity $A(t)$ at $t = 5.5\\ \\mathrm{h}$:\n$$\nA(5.5) = (0.4\\ \\mathrm{mCi}) \\times \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\ln(2)}{6.01\\ \\mathrm{h}} \\times 5.5\\ \\mathrm{h}\\right)\n$$\nThe units of hours in the exponent cancel out, as required. The calculation is:\n$$\nA(5.5) = 0.4 \\times \\exp\\left(-\\frac{5.5}{6.01} \\ln(2)\\right)\n$$\n$$\nA(5.5) \\approx 0.4 \\times \\exp\\left(-0.91514 \\times 0.69315\\right)\n$$\n$$\nA(5.5) \\approx 0.4 \\times \\exp(-0.63430)\n$$\n$$\nA(5.5) \\approx 0.4 \\times 0.53031\n$$\n$$\nA(5.5) \\approx 0.212124\\ \\mathrm{mCi}\n$$\nRounding the result to $3$ significant figures, the activity at the time of incision is $0.212\\ \\mathrm{mCi}$.\n\nPart 2: Discussion of OR Staff Precautions\n\nThe calculated activity of approximately $0.212\\ \\mathrm{mCi}$ ($7.84\\ \\mathrm{MBq}$) of technetium-99m at the time of incision is a medically significant amount of radioactive material. While considered a low-level source, it requires strict adherence to radiation safety protocols to ensure staff doses are kept As Low As Reasonably Achievable (ALARA). The precautions are centered on the principles of time, distance, and shielding, as well as contamination control.\n\n1.  **Time-Distance-Shielding Principle**:\n    *   **Time**: The total radiation dose received by staff is directly proportional to the duration of exposure. OR staff should work efficiently to minimize the time spent in close proximity to the radioactive source, which includes the patient (especially the head and neck region) and the excised specimen (the sentinel lymph node).\n    *   **Distance**: The intensity of gamma radiation decreases with the square of the distance from the source (inverse square law). Staff not directly involved in the procedure should maintain the maximum possible distance from the patient. For example, doubling the distance from the source reduces the dose rate to one-quarter.\n    *   **Shielding**: Technetium-99m emits gamma photons with an energy of $140.5\\ \\mathrm{keV}$. While these photons are penetrating, they can be effectively attenuated by shielding. OR staff working near the patient may wear lead-equivalent aprons, thyroid collars, and leaded eyewear. Most importantly, the excised sentinel node, which is a concentrated source of radioactivity, must be immediately placed in a shielded container for transport and pathological analysis.\n\n2.  **Contamination Control**:\n    *   Radioactive contamination is the unintended presence of radioactive material on surfaces or within the body. Contamination control is critical to prevent both external exposure from contaminated surfaces and internal exposure from inhalation or ingestion.\n    *   Standard universal precautions must be supplemented with specific radiological precautions. All surfaces that may come into contact with the patient's blood, lymph, or the specimen should be covered with disposable, absorbent, plastic-backed sheets.\n    *   All personnel must wear personal protective equipment (PPE), including double gloves and gowns.\n    *   All materials used during the procedure (e.g., surgical instruments, gauze, gloves, drapes) are considered potentially radioactive waste. They must be segregated from regular waste, surveyed with a radiation survey meter (such as a Geiger-Müller counter), and managed according to the institution's radioactive waste disposal protocol. This often involves either storage for decay-in-storage (since Tc-99m has a short half-life) or disposal through licensed radioactive waste services.\n\n**Justification**: The calculated activity of $0.212\\ \\mathrm{mCi}$ confirms that the radiation source is non-trivial. The dose rate from an unshielded point source of this magnitude can significantly exceed background radiation levels at close distances, justifying the strict application of time and distance principles. The potential for specimens to be \"hot spots\" of activity makes shielding of the specimen container essential. Furthermore, any spillage of bodily fluids can spread the $0.212\\ \\mathrm{mCi}$ of activity, creating a contamination hazard. Therefore, the calculated activity level is sufficient to warrant the full suite of described radiation safety and contamination control measures.",

            "problem": "Intraoperative sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB; sentinel lymph node biopsy) for oral cavity malignancy uses a handheld gamma probe to quantify radioactive tracer uptake as counts per second at candidate lymph nodes. Let the measured in vivo count rate at any point be modeled as the sum of a signal component from true nodal tracer uptake and an additive local background rate. A widely used operational decision rule in head and neck surgical oncology is to classify as a sentinel node any candidate node whose net in vivo count rate (defined as measured minus local background) is at least a fixed fraction of the hottest node’s net in vivo count rate. For this case, adopt the fraction to be $0.10$. During mapping, the hottest candidate node measures $2000$ counts per second, two adjacent nodes measure $250$ counts per second and $180$ counts per second, and the local background measured in an adjacent radiotracer-free field is $50$ counts per second.\n\nAssuming steady counting and that background subtraction is performed linearly on rates, determine the total number of nodes that should be removed according to this rule. Report the final answer as an integer with no units.",
            "solution": "The problem asks for the total number of lymph nodes to be classified as sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs) and subsequently removed, based on a specific quantitative rule used in surgical oncology.\n\nFirst, we must formalize the given information and the decision rule. Let $R_{m,i}$ denote the measured in vivo count rate for a candidate lymph node $i$, and let $R_{bg}$ be the local background count rate. All rates are measured in counts per second.\n\nThe problem defines the net in vivo count rate, which we will denote as $R_{net,i}$, for node $i$ as the measured rate minus the local background rate.\n$$R_{net,i} = R_{m,i} - R_{bg}$$\n\nThe problem provides the following data:\nThere are three candidate lymph nodes.\nThe measured rate of the hottest node is $R_{m,1} = 2000$.\nThe measured rate of a second node is $R_{m,2} = 250$.\nThe measured rate of a third node is $R_{m,3} = 180$.\nThe local background rate is given as $R_{bg} = 50$.\n\nThe decision rule for classifying a node as a sentinel node is that its net in vivo count rate must be at least a fixed fraction, $f$, of the hottest node's net in vivo count rate. The given fraction is $f = 0.10$.\n\nLet the hottest node be designated as node $h$. The problem states its measured count rate is the highest, so we identify node $1$ as the hottest node, $h=1$. The decision rule can be stated as: a node $i$ is a sentinel node if\n$$R_{net,i} \\ge f \\times R_{net,h}$$\nwhere $R_{net,h}$ is the net count rate of the hottest node.\n\nOur first step is to calculate the net count rate for each of the three candidate nodes using the given background rate $R_{bg} = 50$.\n\nFor the hottest node (Node 1):\n$$R_{net,1} = R_{m,1} - R_{bg} = 2000 - 50 = 1950$$\nThis is the net count rate of the hottest node, so $R_{net,h} = 1950$.\n\nFor the second node (Node 2):\n$$R_{net,2} = R_{m,2} - R_{bg} = 250 - 50 = 200$$\n\nFor the third node (Node 3):\n$$R_{net,3} = R_{m,3} - R_{bg} = 180 - 50 = 130$$\n\nNext, we establish the threshold for classification. The threshold is $10\\%$ of the hottest node's net rate.\n$$\\text{Threshold} = f \\times R_{net,h} = 0.10 \\times 1950 = 195$$\n\nNow, we apply the decision rule to each node by comparing its net count rate to this threshold value of $195$.\n\nFor Node 1:\nIs $R_{net,1} \\ge 195$?\nWe have $1950 \\ge 195$. This inequality is true. Therefore, Node 1 is classified as a sentinel lymph node. This is expected, as the net rate of the hottest node is always $100\\%$ of itself, which is greater than the $10\\%$ threshold.\n\nFor Node 2:\nIs $R_{net,2} \\ge 195$?\nWe have $200 \\ge 195$. This inequality is true. Therefore, Node 2 is also classified as a sentinel lymph node.\n\nFor Node 3:\nIs $R_{net,3} \\ge 195$?\nWe have $130 \\ge 195$. This inequality is false. Therefore, Node 3 is not classified as a sentinel lymph node.\n\nThe nodes to be removed are those classified as sentinel nodes. Based on this analysis, Node 1 and Node 2 meet the criterion. The total number of nodes to be removed is the count of these nodes.\n\nTotal number of nodes = $1$ (for Node 1) $+ 1$ (for Node 2) $= 2$.",

The concepts of SLN biopsy, micrometastasis, macrometastasis, ENE, and tiered neck dissections (SND, CND) are standard in otorhinolaryngology. The risk stratification based on these factors is a clinically relevant and logical approach. The provided probabilities and risk modifiers, while specific to this problem, are plausible and create a scientifically sound framework.\n- **Well-Posed**: The problem is well-posed. It provides all necessary components: a clear set of initial conditions (positive SLN), defined variables (metastasis size, ENE, number of nodes), quantitative rules for risk calculation (base probabilities, additive and multiplicative modifiers), and a precise, quantitative threshold for the final decision. This structure allows for the derivation of a unique and stable solution.\n- **Objective**: The language is precise, technical, and free of subjective or ambiguous terminology. The rules are stated impersonally as \"well-tested clinical observations\" and \"institutional policy,\" establishing an objective framework for decision-making.\n\nThe problem does not exhibit any flaws such as scientific unsoundness, incompleteness, contradiction, or ambiguity. The order of operations for applying risk modifiers is implicitly standard: multiplicative factors are applied to the base probability before additive factors are included. This is a common and logical convention in risk modeling.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\n\nThe problem is **valid**. The solution process will now proceed.\n\n### Derivation of the Correct Decision Tree\n\nThe core task is to determine the conditions under which the predicted probability of disease beyond levels $1$–$3$, denoted as $P_{ext}$, meets or exceeds the threshold of $0.10$. The calculation of $P_{ext}$ follows the formula derived from the given rules:\n\n$P_{ext} = (P_{base} \\times M_{num}) + A_{ENE}$\n\nWhere:\n- $P_{base}$ is the baseline probability, which is $0.07$ for micrometastasis and $0.20$ for macrometastasis.\n- $M_{num}$ is the multiplicative factor for the number of positive SLNs, which is $1.5$ if there are $\\ge 2$ positive SLNs, and $1.0$ if there is exactly $1$ positive SLN.\n- $A_{ENE}$ is the additive factor for extranodal extension, which is $0.10$ if ENE is present, and $0.0$ if ENE is absent.\n\nThe decision is to perform CND if $P_{ext} \\ge 0.10$ and SND if $P_{ext}  0.10$. We will analyze the cases starting from the first stratification: micrometastasis versus macrometastasis.\n\n**Case 1: Micrometastasis ($P_{base} = 0.07$)**\n\nWe evaluate the four possible sub-scenarios for a patient with micrometastasis.\n\n1.  **Exactly 1 positive SLN, no ENE**:\n    $P_{ext} = (0.07 \\times 1.0) + 0.0 = 0.07$.\n    Since $0.07  0.10$, the decision is **SND**.\n\n2.  **Exactly 1 positive SLN, with ENE**:\n    $P_{ext} = (0.07 \\times 1.0) + 0.10 = 0.17$.\n    Since $0.17 \\ge 0.10$, the decision is **CND**.\n\n3.  **$\\ge 2$ positive SLNs, no ENE**:\n    $P_{ext} = (0.07 \\times 1.5) + 0.0 = 0.105$.\n    Since $0.105 \\ge 0.10$, the decision is **CND**.\n\n4.  **$\\ge 2$ positive SLNs, with ENE**:\n    $P_{ext} = (0.07 \\times 1.5) + 0.10 = 0.105 + 0.10 = 0.205$.\n    Since $0.205 \\ge 0.10$, the decision is **CND**.\n\n**Summary for Micrometastasis**: SND is indicated only in the specific scenario of a single positive SLN with no ENE. The presence of either ENE or $\\ge 2$ positive SLNs raises the risk above the threshold, mandating a CND.\n\n**Case 2: Macrometastasis ($P_{base} = 0.20$)**\n\nWe evaluate the sub-scenarios for a patient with macrometastasis.\n\n1.  **Exactly 1 positive SLN, no ENE**:\n    $P_{ext} = (0.20 \\times 1.0) + 0.0 = 0.20$.\n    Since $0.20 \\ge 0.10$, the decision is **CND**.\n\nThe baseline probability for macrometastasis ($0.20$) is already above the $0.10$ threshold. Any additional risk factors (ENE or $\\ge 2$ positive SLNs) will only increase this probability further. Therefore, for any and all scenarios involving macrometastasis, the risk will always be $\\ge 0.20$.\n\n**Summary for Macrometastasis**: CND is indicated in all cases of macrometastasis, regardless of the number of positive nodes or the presence of ENE.\n\n**Synthesized Decision Rule**:\nBased on the analysis, the comprehensive decision tree is as follows:\n- Start with a positive SLN.\n- Branch based on metastasis size.\n- If **macrometastasis**, the decision is always **CND**.\n- If **micrometastasis**, further stratify:\n    - If there is **exactly $1$ positive SLN AND no ENE**, the decision is **SND**.\n    - Otherwise (i.e., if ENE is present OR if there are $\\ge 2$ positive SLNs), the decision is **CND**.\n\nThis can be simplified into a single rule: Perform SND if and only if the patient has micrometastasis, exactly $1$ positive SLN, and no ENE. In all other circumstances (macrometastasis, or presence of ENE, or $\\ge 2$ positive SLNs), perform CND.\n\n### Evaluation of Options\n\n**A. SLN positive ⟶ If micrometastasis with exactly $1$ positive SLN and no ENE: perform SND (levels $1$–$3$). Otherwise (macrometastasis, or ENE present, or $\\ge 2$ positive SLNs): perform CND (levels $1$–$5$).**\nThis option perfectly matches the derived decision rule. It correctly identifies the single, specific indication for SND (micrometastasis, $1$ SLN, no ENE) where the risk is calculated to be $0.07$. It correctly groups all other scenarios under the \"Otherwise\" clause, which mandates CND. These other scenarios are having macrometastasis (risk $\\ge 0.20$), having ENE (risk $\\ge 0.17$ for micrometastasis), or having $\\ge 2$ positive SLNs (risk $\\ge 0.105$ for micrometastasis), all of which meet the threshold for CND. This statement is the logical equivalent of our synthesized rule.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. SLN positive ⟶ Perform SND for micrometastasis and for macrometastasis; escalate to CND only if macrometastasis, ENE, and $\\ge 2$ positive SLNs are all simultaneously present.**\nThis option is incorrect. It suggests that SND is the default procedure for nearly all cases. For example, it recommends SND for a patient with macrometastasis, $1$ SLN, and no ENE. Our calculation shows the risk for this scenario is $0.20$, which requires CND. It also incorrectly recommends SND for a patient with micrometastasis and ENE (risk of $0.17$, requires CND). This option drastically under-treats patients according to the problem's criteria.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. SLN positive ⟶ For micrometastasis: no immediate neck dissection (observation only). For macrometastasis: perform SND. If ENE is present: perform CND.**\nThis option contains multiple errors. First, it introduces \"observation,\" which is not part of the problem's decision space (SND vs. CND) and is clinically inappropriate for known nodal disease. Second, it recommends SND for macrometastasis; our analysis shows CND is required in all cases of macrometastasis. Third, its rule for CND (\"If ENE is present\") is incomplete, as it ignores the number of positive nodes and metastasis size as independent triggers for CND.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. SLN positive ⟶ Base the extent of neck dissection solely on primary tumor T stage: T$1$–T$2$ ⟶ SND; T$3$–T$4$ ⟶ CND; ignore SLN metastasis size, ENE, and number of positive SLNs.**\nThis option is incorrect because it proposes a decision algorithm based on data (primary tumor T stage) that is not provided or utilized in the problem's established risk calculation framework. The problem explicitly bases the decision on SLN characteristics (metastasis size, number, ENE), which this option advises to ignore.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**E. SLN positive ⟶ Perform CND (levels $1$–$5$) in all cases, irrespective of micrometastasis versus macrometastasis, ENE, or number of positive SLNs.**\nThis option is incorrect because it fails to recognize the one specific scenario where the institutional policy supports de-escalation of surgery. For a patient with micrometastasis, $1$ positive SLN, and no ENE, the risk is $0.07$, which is below the $0.10$ threshold. The policy explicitly prefers SND in this case to limit morbidity. Performing CND would constitute overtreatment for this subgroup according to the given rules.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**",
