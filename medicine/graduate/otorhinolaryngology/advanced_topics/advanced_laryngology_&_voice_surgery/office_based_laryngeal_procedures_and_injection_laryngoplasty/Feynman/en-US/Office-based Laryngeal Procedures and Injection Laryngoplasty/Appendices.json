            "problem": "A patient with unilateral vocal fold paresis is scheduled for office-based injection laryngoplasty (IL). The goal is to reduce a measured mid-membranous glottic gap by a medial shift of the affected vocal fold’s medial surface. Assume the following clinically grounded, simplified mechanical and geometric model:\n\n- The injected material and local soft tissue can be treated as effectively incompressible over the time scale of the procedure, so that the injected volume is equal to the volume of medial displacement created.\n- Gentle digital massage distributes the injectate uniformly along the membranous portion of the vocal fold, so that the medial displacement is approximately uniform along that anteroposterior segment and uniform over the targeted superior–inferior contact height.\n- Small-deformation geometry applies, so that the medial displacement can be modeled as filling a right rectangular prism whose dimensions are the membranous length, the superior–inferior contact height, and the desired medial shift at the mid-membranous point.\n\nOn endoscopic examination, the membranous length targeted is measured as $12$ millimeters, and the desired superior–inferior contact height to be engaged is $5.0$ millimeters. The required reduction in the mid-membranous gap, achieved by unilateral medialization, is $0.64$ millimeters.\n\nUsing only the assumptions above and first principles of volume conservation and Euclidean geometry, compute the minimum injection volume needed to achieve the specified mid-membranous reduction.

            "solution": "The problem will first be validated for scientific and logical integrity.\n\n### Step 1: Extract Givens\nThe verbatim givens from the problem statement are:\n- The injected volume is equal to the volume of medial displacement created (conservation of volume).\n- The medial displacement can be modeled as filling a right rectangular prism.\n- The dimensions of the prism are the membranous length, the superior–inferior contact height, and the desired medial shift.\n- Membranous length: $12$ millimeters.\n- Superior–inferior contact height: $5.0$ millimeters.\n- Required reduction in the mid-membranous gap (medial shift): $0.64$ millimeters.\n- The final answer must be in microliters ($\\mu$L).\n- The final answer must be rounded to three significant figures.\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\nThe problem is evaluated against the validation criteria.\n- **Scientifically Grounded**: The problem describes a simplified biomechanical model of injection laryngoplasty, a standard medical procedure. The assumptions of incompressibility and a simplified geometric displacement (a right rectangular prism) are common and valid first-order approximations in biomechanics for small deformations. The anatomical dimensions provided are realistic. The problem is grounded in established principles of geometry and physics as applied to a real-world medical context.\n- **Well-Posed**: The problem is well-posed. It provides all necessary information to calculate a unique volume based on the specified model. The objective is clearly stated, and the path to the solution is unambiguous.\n- **Objective**: The problem is stated in objective, quantitative terms, free of subjective or opinion-based language.\n- **Completeness and Consistency**: The problem is self-contained and internally consistent. All required dimensions for the volume calculation are provided, and there are no contradictory constraints.\n- **Feasibility**: The physical parameters and the procedure described are realistic and feasible.\n- **Verdict**: The problem is deemed valid as it is scientifically sound, well-posed, objective, and complete.\n\n### Step 3: Proceed to Solution\nThe problem asks for the minimum injection volume required to achieve a specified medial displacement of a vocal fold. The provided model simplifies the displacement volume to that of a right rectangular prism.\n\nThe volume $V$ of a right rectangular prism is given by the product of its length $L$, height $H$, and width $W$:\n$$V = L \\times H \\times W$$\n\nAccording to the problem statement, these dimensions correspond to:\n- The membranous length, $L = 12$ mm.\n- The superior–inferior contact height, $H = 5.0$ mm.\n- The desired medial shift, which is the width of the prism, $W = 0.64$ mm.\n\nThe principle of volume conservation states that the injected volume is equal to the volume of medial displacement. Therefore, we must calculate the volume of this prism.\n\nSubstituting the given values into the volume formula:\n$$V = (12 \\text{ mm}) \\times (5.0 \\text{ mm}) \\times (0.64 \\text{ mm})$$\n\nFirst, we compute the product of the dimensions:\n$$12 \\times 5.0 = 60.0$$\n$$60.0 \\times 0.64 = 38.4$$\n\nSo, the volume is:\n$$V = 38.4 \\text{ mm}^3$$\n\nThe problem requires the answer to be expressed in microliters ($\\mu$L). We must perform a unit conversion from cubic millimeters ($\\text{mm}^3$) to microliters. The standard relationships are:\n$1$ liter (L) $= 1000$ milliliters (mL)\n$1$ mL $= 1$ cubic centimeter ($\\text{cm}^3$)\n$1$ cm $= 10$ mm\n\nFrom the last relationship, we can find the conversion between $\\text{cm}^3$ and $\\text{mm}^3$:\n$$1 \\text{ cm}^3 = (10 \\text{ mm})^3 = 1000 \\text{ mm}^3$$\n\nCombining these, we have:\n$$1 \\text{ mL} = 1000 \\text{ mm}^3$$\n\nWe also know the relationship between milliliters and microliters:\n$$1 \\text{ mL} = 1000 \\text{ }\\mu\\text{L}$$\n\nEquating the two expressions for $1$ mL:\n$$1000 \\text{ }\\mu\\text{L} = 1000 \\text{ mm}^3$$\n\nThis simplifies to a direct one-to-one conversion factor:\n$$1 \\text{ }\\mu\\text{L} = 1 \\text{ mm}^3$$\n\nTherefore, the calculated volume in cubic millimeters is numerically equal to the volume in microliters.\n$$V = 38.4 \\text{ }\\mu\\text{L}$$\n\nFinally, the problem requires the answer to be rounded to three significant figures. The calculated value, $38.4$, already contains exactly three significant figures (the digits $3$, $8$, and $4$). Thus, no further rounding is necessary.\n\nIt is noted that the input values $5.0$ mm and $0.64$ mm have only two significant figures. Standard scientific practice would suggest reporting the final answer with two significant figures (i.e., $38$ $\\mu$L). However, the problem provides an explicit instruction to round to three significant figures, which supersedes the general rule. Adherence to the problem's explicit constraints is paramount.\n\nThe minimum injection volume required is $38.4$ $\\mu$L.",

It is a standard application of fluid dynamics principles to a simplified biomechanical model. A complete solution will be provided.\n\nThe problem requires relating the Phonation Threshold Pressure (PTP) to the glottal half-width ($w$). Based on the assumptions, the airflow through the glottis can be treated as pressure-driven laminar flow between two parallel plates. The governing equation for such a flow, derived from the Navier-Stokes equations under the specified conditions (steady, incompressible, fully developed laminar flow), relates the volumetric flow rate, $Q$, to the pressure drop, $\\Delta P$, along the channel length, $L$.\n\nThe velocity profile, $u(y)$, for a fluid with dynamic viscosity $\\mu$ between two parallel plates separated by a distance $2w$ is parabolic:\n$$u(y) = \\frac{\\Delta P}{2\\mu L}(w^2 - y^2)$$\nwhere $y$ is the transverse coordinate measured from the centerline of the glottal channel (i.e., $y=0$ at the center, and $y=\\pm w$ at the vocal fold surfaces, where the no-slip condition $u(\\pm w)=0$ is satisfied).\n\nThe total volumetric flow rate, $Q$, is obtained by integrating this velocity profile over the cross-sectional area of the channel, $A = B \\times (2w)$, where $B$ is the breadth of the glottis.\n$$Q = \\int_{-w}^{w} u(y) B \\, dy = B \\int_{-w}^{w} \\frac{\\Delta P}{2\\mu L}(w^2 - y^2) \\, dy$$\nPerforming the integration:\n$$Q = \\frac{B \\Delta P}{2\\mu L} \\left[ w^2y - \\frac{y^3}{3} \\right]_{-w}^{w}$$\n$$Q = \\frac{B \\Delta P}{2\\mu L} \\left( \\left(w^3 - \\frac{w^3}{3}\\right) - \\left(-w^3 - \\frac{-w^3}{3}\\right) \\right)$$\n$$Q = \\frac{B \\Delta P}{2\\mu L} \\left( \\frac{2w^3}{3} - \\left(-\\frac{2w^3}{3}\\right) \\right) = \\frac{B \\Delta P}{2\\mu L} \\left( \\frac{4w^3}{3} \\right)$$\n$$Q = \\frac{2 B w^3 \\Delta P}{3 \\mu L}$$\nThis equation is a form of the Hagen-Poiseuille law for a rectangular channel where $B \\gg 2w$.\n\nAccording to the problem statement, the Phonation Threshold Pressure (PTP) is the minimal pressure drop required to initiate oscillation, so we set $\\Delta P = \\mathrm{PTP}$. The flow rate at this threshold is denoted $Q_{\\mathrm{th}}$. The equation becomes:\n$$Q_{\\mathrm{th}} = \\frac{2 B w^3}{3 \\mu L} \\mathrm{PTP}$$\nTo determine how PTP scales with the glottal half-width $w$, we rearrange the equation to solve for PTP:\n$$\\mathrm{PTP} = Q_{\\mathrm{th}} \\left( \\frac{3 \\mu L}{2 B w^3} \\right)$$\nThe problem states that over the short timescale of the procedure, the parameters $L$, $B$, $\\mu$ (viscosity of air), and critically, the threshold flow rate $Q_{\\mathrm{th}}$, are to be considered constant. Grouping all constant terms into a single constant $C = Q_{\\mathrm{th}} \\frac{3 \\mu L}{2 B}$, we find the relationship:\n$$\\mathrm{PTP} = \\frac{C}{w^3}$$\nThus, the Phonation Threshold Pressure (PTP) scales inversely with the cube of the glottal half-width, $w$.\n$$\\mathrm{PTP} \\propto w^{-3}$$\nThis is the required scaling law.\n\nNext, we compute the multiplicative factor by which PTP changes. Let the pre-procedural state be denoted with the subscript 'before' and the post-procedural state with 'after'. We can write the PTP for each state:\n$$\\mathrm{PTP}_{\\text{before}} = \\frac{C}{w_{\\text{before}}^3}$$\n$$\\mathrm{PTP}_{\\text{after}} = \\frac{C}{w_{\\text{after}}^3}$$\nThe ratio is:\n$$\\frac{\\mathrm{PTP}_{\\text{after}}}{\\mathrm{PTP}_{\\text{before}}} = \\frac{C/w_{\\text{after}}^3}{C/w_{\\text{before}}^3} = \\frac{w_{\\text{before}}^3}{w_{\\text{after}}^3} = \\left(\\frac{w_{\\text{before}}}{w_{\\text{after}}}\\right)^3$$\nThe problem states that the glottal half-width decreases by $20\\%$ after the procedure. This means the new half-width, $w_{\\text{after}}$, is $80\\%$ of the original half-width, $w_{\\text{before}}$.\n$$w_{\\text{after}} = w_{\\text{before}} - 0.20 \\cdot w_{\\text{before}} = (1 - 0.20) w_{\\text{before}} = 0.80 \\cdot w_{\\text{before}}$$\nSubstituting this relationship into the ratio equation:\n$$\\frac{\\mathrm{PTP}_{\\text{after}}}{\\mathrm{PTP}_{\\text{before}}} = \\left(\\frac{w_{\\text{before}}}{0.80 \\cdot w_{\\text{before}}}\\right)^3 = \\left(\\frac{1}{0.80}\\right)^3$$\nCalculating the value:\n$$\\frac{1}{0.80} = \\frac{1}{4/5} = \\frac{5}{4} = 1.25$$\nSo the ratio is:\n$$\\left(1.25\\right)^3 = 1.25 \\times 1.25 \\times 1.25 = 1.5625 \\times 1.25 = 1.953125$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures.\n$$1.953125 \\approx 1.953$$\nTherefore, the PTP increases by a multiplicative factor of approximately $1.953$.",
