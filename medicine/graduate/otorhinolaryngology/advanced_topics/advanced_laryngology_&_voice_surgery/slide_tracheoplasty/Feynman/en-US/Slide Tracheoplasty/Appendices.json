The procedure, slide tracheoplasty, is a standard surgical technique for tracheal stenosis.

The given diameter is anatomically plausible for a pediatric patient. The problem is scientifically sound.\n- **Well-Posed:** The problem is self-contained. It provides all necessary data and relationships to determine the requested quantities. The objectives are clearly stated, and a unique solution can be derived from the given information.\n- **Objective:** The problem is phrased in a clear, precise, and unbiased manner, free of subjective terminology.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is deemed **valid** as it is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective, with no identifiable flaws. A full solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe solution is determined in two parts as requested.\n\n**Part 1: Determination of the Postoperative Internal Diameter ($d_{\\text{post}}$)**\n\nThe cross-sectional area, $A$, of a cylinder with internal diameter $d$ is given by the formula for the area of a circle. The radius $r$ is half the diameter, $r = \\frac{d}{2}$.\n$$A = \\pi r^2 = \\pi \\left(\\frac{d}{2}\\right)^2 = \\frac{\\pi d^2}{4}$$\nThe preoperative internal diameter is given as $d_{\\text{pre}} = 6$ mm. The preoperative cross-sectional area, $A_{\\text{pre}}$, is therefore:\n$$A_{\\text{pre}} = \\frac{\\pi (d_{\\text{pre}})^2}{4} = \\frac{\\pi (6 \\text{ mm})^2}{4} = \\frac{36\\pi}{4} \\text{ mm}^2 = 9\\pi \\text{ mm}^2$$\nThe problem states that the operation doubles the cross-sectional area. Thus, the postoperative area, $A_{\\text{post}}$, is:\n$$A_{\\text{post}} = 2 A_{\\text{pre}} = 2 (9\\pi \\text{ mm}^2) = 18\\pi \\text{ mm}^2$$\nWe can now use the area formula to find the postoperative internal diameter, $d_{\\text{post}}$:\n$$A_{\\text{post}} = \\frac{\\pi (d_{\\text{post}})^2}{4}$$\nSubstituting the value of $A_{\\text{post}}$:\n$$18\\pi = \\frac{\\pi (d_{\\text{post}})^2}{4}$$\nTo solve for $d_{\\text{post}}$, we first multiply both sides by $4$ and divide by $\\pi$:\n$$(18\\pi) \\times 4 = \\pi (d_{\\text{post}})^2$$\n$$72\\pi = \\pi (d_{\\text{post}})^2$$\n$$72 = (d_{\\text{post}})^2$$\nTaking the square root of both sides yields the diameter (which must be a positive value):\n$$d_{\\text{post}} = \\sqrt{72}$$\nTo express this as a simplified exact analytic expression, we factor the number under the radical:\n$$d_{\\text{post}} = \\sqrt{36 \\times 2} = \\sqrt{36} \\times \\sqrt{2} = 6\\sqrt{2}$$\nThe postoperative internal diameter is $d_{\\text{post}} = 6\\sqrt{2}$ mm.\n\n**Part 2: Determination of the Multiplicative Change in Airway Resistance ($\\frac{R_{\\text{post}}}{R_{\\text{pre}}}$)**\n\nFor steady, laminar flow of a Newtonian fluid through a cylindrical conduit, the resistance to flow, $R$, is given by the Hagen-Poiseuille equation:\n$$R = \\frac{8\\mu L}{\\pi r^4}$$\nwhere $\\mu$ is the dynamic viscosity of the fluid and $L$ is the length of the conduit. Expressing this in terms of diameter $d = 2r$:\n$$R = \\frac{8\\mu L}{\\pi (\\frac{d}{2})^4} = \\frac{8\\mu L}{\\pi \\frac{d^4}{16}} = \\frac{128\\mu L}{\\pi d^4}$$\nThe problem states that the airway resistance is dominated by the stenotic segment, and that the segment length $L$ and fluid properties (implying $\\mu$) are unchanged by the operation. Therefore, the resistance $R$ is inversely proportional to the fourth power of the internal diameter $d$:\n$$R \\propto \\frac{1}{d^4}$$\nThe ratio of postoperative resistance ($R_{\\text{post}}$) to preoperative resistance ($R_{\\text{pre}}$) can be written as:\n$$\\frac{R_{\\text{post}}}{R_{\\text{pre}}} = \\frac{\\frac{128\\mu L}{\\pi (d_{\\text{post}})^4}}{\\frac{128\\mu L}{\\pi (d_{\\text{pre}})^4}} = \\frac{(d_{\\text{pre}})^4}{(d_{\\text{post}})^4} = \\left(\\frac{d_{\\text{pre}}}{d_{\\text{post}}}\\right)^4$$\nSubstituting the derived values for the diameters, $d_{\\text{pre}} = 6$ and $d_{\\text{post}} = 6\\sqrt{2}$:\n$$\\frac{R_{\\text{post}}}{R_{\\text{pre}}} = \\left(\\frac{6}{6\\sqrt{2}}\\right)^4 = \\left(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\right)^4$$\nSimplifying this expression:\n$$\\frac{R_{\\text{post}}}{R_{\\text{pre}}} = \\frac{1^4}{(\\sqrt{2})^4} = \\frac{1}{4}$$\nAlternatively, we can use the area relationship. Since $A = \\frac{\\pi d^2}{4}$, we have $d^2 = \\frac{4A}{\\pi}$, so $d^4 = \\left(\\frac{4A}{\\pi}\\right)^2$. This means $R \\propto \\frac{1}{A^2}$. The resistance ratio is then:\n$$\\frac{R_{\\text{post}}}{R_{\\text{pre}}} = \\left(\\frac{A_{\\text{pre}}}{A_{\\text{post}}}\\right)^2$$\nGiven that $A_{\\text{post}} = 2 A_{\\text{pre}}$:\n$$\\frac{R_{\\text{post}}}{R_{\\text{pre}}} = \\left(\\frac{A_{\\text{pre}}}{2A_{\\text{pre}}}\\right)^2 = \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^2 = \\frac{1}{4}$$\nBoth methods yield the same result. The multiplicative change in airway resistance is a factor of $\\frac{1}{4}$. The new resistance is one-quarter of the original resistance.",

            "problem": "A neonate with congenital long-segment tracheal stenosis is scheduled for slide tracheoplasty. Assume steady, laminar airflow and model the stenotic segment as a rigid cylindrical tube of length $L_0$ and radius $r_0$. The hydraulic resistance is defined by the Hagen–Poiseuille relationship, so that $R \\propto L/r^4$. Slide tracheoplasty both shortens the stenotic segment and enlarges the lumen. Consider two geometric outcomes that are often conflated in surgical descriptions: (i) simple area-doubling, meaning the cross-sectional area increases by a factor of $2$ (so $A_1=2A_0$), and (ii) diameter-doubling, meaning the diameter increases by a factor of $2$ (so $d_1=2d_0$). In both scenarios, suppose the effective stenotic length is reduced to $L_1=L_0/2$ by the slide maneuver. Using only first principles (Hagen–Poiseuille and $A=\\pi r^2$, $d=2r$), determine which statement correctly differentiates the geometric changes and quantifies the resulting resistance ratio $R_1/R_0$.\n\nA. With $L_1=L_0/2$, area-doubling gives $R_1/R_0=1/8$ and diameter-doubling gives $R_1/R_0=1/32$; the distinction arises because $A\\propto r^2$ and $R\\propto L/r^4$, so doubling area implies $r_1=\\sqrt{2}\\,r_0$, while doubling diameter implies $r_1=2r_0$.\n\nB.

            "solution": "The problem statement is first validated for scientific soundness, consistency, and completeness.\n\n### Step 1: Extract Givens\n- Flow condition: Steady, laminar airflow.\n- Initial stenotic segment model: Rigid cylindrical tube.\n- Initial length: $L_0$.\n- Initial radius: $r_0$.\n- Initial cross-sectional area: $A_0 = \\pi r_0^2$.\n- Initial diameter: $d_0 = 2r_0$.\n- Hydraulic resistance relationship: $R \\propto L/r^4$ (from Hagen–Poiseuille).\n- Post-operative length: $L_1 = L_0/2$.\n- Scenario (i) - Area-doubling: $A_1 = 2A_0$.\n- Scenario (ii) - Diameter-doubling: $d_1 = 2d_0$.\n- Fundamental geometric relations: $A = \\pi r^2$, $d = 2r$.\n- Objective: Calculate the resistance ratio $R_1/R_0$ for both scenarios.\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\nThe problem is scientifically grounded. It applies the Hagen–Poiseuille law, a fundamental principle of fluid mechanics, to a biomedical scenario. The assumptions of a rigid tube and steady, laminar flow are standard simplifications for creating a tractable first-principles problem. The problem is well-posed, providing all necessary information to calculate a unique solution. It is stated objectively and uses precise mathematical definitions. There are no internal contradictions or factual errors. The distinction between area-doubling and diameter-doubling is a key conceptual point that is valid and important in scaling analyses.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem statement is valid. A solution will be derived.\n\n### Derivation\nThe hydraulic resistance $R$ is given by the Hagen–Poiseuille relationship, stated as a proportionality:\n$$ R \\propto \\frac{L}{r^4} $$\nThis can be written with a constant of proportionality, $k$:\n$$ R = k \\frac{L}{r^4} $$\nThe initial resistance, $R_0$, of the stenotic segment is:\n$$ R_0 = k \\frac{L_0}{r_0^4} $$\nThe final resistance, $R_1$, after the slide tracheoplasty is:\n$$ R_1 = k \\frac{L_1}{r_1^4} $$\nThe ratio of the final resistance to the initial resistance, $R_1/R_0$, is therefore:\n$$ \\frac{R_1}{R_0} = \\frac{k L_1 / r_1^4}{k L_0 / r_0^4} = \\left(\\frac{L_1}{L_0}\\right) \\left(\\frac{r_0}{r_1}\\right)^4 $$\nThe problem states that the length is halved, so $L_1 = L_0/2$, or $L_1/L_0 = 1/2$. Substituting this into the ratio equation gives:\n$$ \\frac{R_1}{R_0} = \\frac{1}{2} \\left(\\frac{r_0}{r_1}\\right)^4 $$\nWe now analyze the two specified geometric outcomes.\n\n**Scenario (i): Area-doubling**\nIn this case, the final cross-sectional area $A_1$ is twice the initial area $A_0$.\n$$ A_1 = 2 A_0 $$\nUsing the formula for the area of a circle, $A=\\pi r^2$:\n$$ \\pi r_1^2 = 2 (\\pi r_0^2) $$\n$$ r_1^2 = 2 r_0^2 $$\n$$ r_1 = \\sqrt{2} \\, r_0 $$\nNow, we substitute this relationship for $r_1$ into the resistance ratio equation:\n$$ \\frac{R_1}{R_0} = \\frac{1}{2} \\left(\\frac{r_0}{\\sqrt{2} \\, r_0}\\right)^4 = \\frac{1}{2} \\left(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\right)^4 $$\n$$ \\left(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\right)^4 = \\frac{1}{(\\sqrt{2})^4} = \\frac{1}{(2^{1/2})^4} = \\frac{1}{2^2} = \\frac{1}{4} $$\nTherefore, for area-doubling:\n$$ \\frac{R_1}{R_0} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{1}{4} = \\frac{1}{8} $$\n\n**Scenario (ii): Diameter-doubling**\nIn this case, the final diameter $d_1$ is twice the initial diameter $d_0$.\n$$ d_1 = 2 d_0 $$\nUsing the relationship between diameter and radius, $d=2r$:\n$$ 2 r_1 = 2 (2 r_0) $$\n$$ r_1 = 2 r_0 $$\nWe substitute this new relationship for $r_1$ into the resistance ratio equation:\n$$ \\frac{R_1}{R_0} = \\frac{1}{2} \\left(\\frac{r_0}{2 r_0}\\right)^4 = \\frac{1}{2} \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^4 $$\n$$ \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^4 = \\frac{1}{16} $$\nTherefore, for diameter-doubling:\n$$ \\frac{R_1}{R_0} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{1}{16} = \\frac{1}{32} $$\n\nThe analysis confirms that the two scenarios yield substantially different reductions in resistance because of the strong dependence of resistance on the radius ($R \\propto r^{-4}$).\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. With $L_1=L_0/2$, area-doubling gives $R_1/R_0=1/8$ and diameter-doubling gives $R_1/R_0=1/32$; the distinction arises because $A\\propto r^2$ and $R\\propto L/r^4$, so doubling area implies $r_1=\\sqrt{2}\\,r_0$, while doubling diameter implies $r_1=2r_0$.**\nThis statement's calculated resistance ratios, $R_1/R_0 = 1/8$ for area-doubling and $R_1/R_0 = 1/32$ for diameter-doubling, exactly match our derivations. The reasoning provided is also correct: the distinction is rooted in the nonlinear relationship between area ($A \\propto r^2$) and resistance ($R \\propto r^{-4}$). It correctly identifies that area-doubling implies an increase in radius by a factor of $\\sqrt{2}$, while diameter-doubling implies an increase in radius by a factor of a factor of $2$.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. With $L_1=L_0/2$, area-doubling gives $R_1/R_0=1/4$ and diameter-doubling gives $R_1/R_0=1/8$, because resistance scales inversely with $r^2$ rather than $r^4$.**\nThe resistance ratios calculated here are incorrect. The reasoning provided, that $R \\propto r^{-2}$, explicitly contradicts the Hagen–Poiseuille relationship ($R \\propto r^{-4}$) given in the problem statement.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. With $L_1=L_0/2$, both area-doubling and diameter-doubling yield $R_1/R_0=1/16$ because resistance depends only on cross-sectional area and not on length when flow is laminar.**\nThis statement makes two incorrect claims. First, as derived, the two scenarios yield different resistance ratios ($1/8$ and $1/32$). Second, the reasoning that resistance is independent of length contradicts the Hagen–Poiseuille relationship, where $R \\propto L$.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. With $L_1=L_0/2$, the benefit of increasing radius is nullified by shortening, so area-doubling and diameter-doubling reduce resistance to the same ratio $R_1/R_0=1/2$.**\nThis statement is incorrect. The resistance reduction from shortening the length to $L_1 = L_0/2$ would, by itself, result in $R_1/R_0=1/2$. Any increase in radius further reduces the resistance. The effects are multiplicative, not nullifying. The calculated ratio of $1/2$ ignores the significant benefit of lumen enlargement, and the claim that both scenarios result in the same ratio is false.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**E. With $L_1=L_0/2$, area-doubling yields $R_1/R_0=1/8$, but diameter-doubling triggers turbulent flow that negates any additional reduction beyond $R_1/R_0=1/8$ under clinical airflow conditions.**\nWhile the first part of the statement (area-doubling gives $R_1/R_0 = 1/8$) is correct, the second part introduces a physical phenomenon, turbulence, that is explicitly excluded by the problem's primary assumption to \"Assume steady, laminar airflow\". The task is to perform a calculation based *only* on the provided first principles and assumptions. This option violates this constraint by introducing an external, unstated complexity. Therefore, within the framework of the problem, this statement is invalid.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**",

The local pressure drop $dP$ across this element is given by the differential form of the Hagen–Poiseuille law:\n$$Q = -\\frac{dP}{dx} \\frac{\\pi [r(x)]^4}{8 \\mu}$$\nThe total pressure drop $\\Delta P_{\\text{pre}} = P(0) - P(L_{\\text{pre}})$ is found by integrating $dP$ over the length of the tube:\n$$\\Delta P_{\\text{pre}} = \\int_{0}^{L_{\\text{pre}}} -\\frac{dP}{dx} dx = \\int_{0}^{L_{\\text{pre}}} \\frac{8 \\mu Q}{\\pi [r(x)]^4} dx$$\nSince $8$, $\\mu$, $Q$, and $\\pi$ are constants, we can pull them out of the integral:\n$$\\Delta P_{\\text{pre}} = \\frac{8 \\mu Q}{\\pi} \\int_{0}^{L_{\\text{pre}}} \\frac{1}{\\left(r_a + \\frac{r_b - r_a}{L_{\\text{pre}}}x\\right)^4} dx$$\nTo solve the integral, we perform a change of variable. Let $u = r_a + \\frac{r_b - r_a}{L_{\\text{pre}}}x$. Then $du = \\frac{r_b - r_a}{L_{\\text{pre}}}dx$, which gives $dx = \\frac{L_{\\text{pre}}}{r_b - r_a}du$. The limits of integration become $u(0)=r_a$ and $u(L_{\\text{pre}})=r_b$.\n\\begin{align*} \\Delta P_{\\text{pre}} &= \\frac{8 \\mu Q}{\\pi} \\int_{r_a}^{r_b} u^{-4} \\left(\\frac{L_{\\text{pre}}}{r_b - r_a}\\right) du \\\\ &= \\frac{8 \\mu Q L_{\\text{pre}}}{\\pi(r_b - r_a)} \\left[ \\frac{u^{-3}}{-3} \\right]_{r_a}^{r_b} \\\\ &= \\frac{8 \\mu Q L_{\\text{pre}}}{-3\\pi(r_b - r_a)} (r_b^{-3} - r_a^{-3}) \\\\ &= \\frac{8 \\mu Q L_{\\text{pre}}}{3\\pi(r_b - r_a)} (r_a^{-3} - r_b^{-3}) \\\\ &= \\frac{8 \\mu Q L_{\\text{pre}}}{3\\pi(r_b - r_a)} \\left(\\frac{1}{r_a^3} - \\frac{1}{r_b^3}\\right)\\end{align*}\n\n**Ratio of Pressure Drops**\nWe are asked to compute the ratio $\\Delta P_{\\text{pre}} / \\Delta P_{\\text{post}}$.\n$$\\frac{\\Delta P_{\\text{pre}}}{\\Delta P_{\\text{post}}} = \\frac{\\frac{8 \\mu Q L_{\\text{pre}}}{3\\pi(r_b - r_a)} \\left(\\frac{1}{r_a^3} - \\frac{1}{r_b^3}\\right)}{\\frac{8 \\mu L_{\\text{post}} Q}{\\pi r_{\\text{post}}^4}}$$\nThe terms $8$, $\\mu$, $Q$, and $\\pi$ cancel, simplifying the expression significantly. This means the ratio is independent of the fluid's viscosity and the specific flow rate, and depends only on the geometries.\n$$\\frac{\\Delta P_{\\text{pre}}}{\\Delta P_{\\text{post}}} = \\frac{\\frac{L_{\\text{pre}}}{3(r_b - r_a)} \\left(\\frac{1}{r_a^3} - \\frac{1}{r_b^3}\\right)}{\\frac{L_{\\text{post}}}{r_{\\text{post}}^4}} = \\frac{L_{\\text{pre}}}{L_{\\text{post}}} \\frac{r_{\\text{post}}^4}{3(r_b - r_a)} \\left(\\frac{1}{r_a^3} - \\frac{1}{r_b^3}\\right)$$\n\nNow, we substitute the numerical values in SI units into this expression:\n$L_{\\text{pre}} = 0.020\\,\\text{m}$\n$L_{\\text{post}} = 0.010\\,\\text{m}$\n$r_a = 1.5 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\text{m}$\n$r_b = 2.5 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\text{m}$\n$r_{\\text{post}} = 4.0 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\text{m}$\n\n$$ \\frac{\\Delta P_{\\text{pre}}}{\\Delta P_{\\text{post}}} = \\frac{0.020}{0.010} \\frac{(4.0 \\times 10^{-3})^4}{3(2.5 \\times 10^{-3} - 1.5 \\times 10^{-3})} \\left(\\frac{1}{(1.5 \\times 10^{-3})^3} - \\frac{1}{(2.5 \\times 10^{-3})^3}\\right) $$\n$$ = 2 \\cdot \\frac{256 \\times 10^{-12}}{3(1.0 \\times 10^{-3})} \\left(\\frac{1}{3.375 \\times 10^{-9}} - \\frac{1}{15.625 \\times 10^{-9}}\\right) $$\n$$ = 2 \\cdot \\frac{256 \\times 10^{-12}}{3 \\times 10^{-3} \\cdot 10^{-9}} \\left(\\frac{1}{3.375} - \\frac{1}{15.625}\\right) $$\nThe powers of $10$ cancel out:\n$$ = 2 \\cdot \\frac{256}{3} \\left(\\frac{1}{3.375} - \\frac{1}{15.625}\\right) $$\nTo maintain precision, we use fractions: $3.375 = \\frac{27}{8}$ and $15.625 = \\frac{125}{8}$.\n$$ = \\frac{512}{3} \\left(\\frac{8}{27} - \\frac{8}{125}\\right) = \\frac{512}{3} \\cdot 8 \\left(\\frac{1}{27} - \\frac{1}{125}\\right) $$\n$$ = \\frac{4096}{3} \\left(\\frac{125 - 27}{27 \\times 125}\\right) = \\frac{4096}{3} \\left(\\frac{98}{3375}\\right) $$\n$$ = \\frac{4096 \\times 98}{3 \\times 3375} = \\frac{401408}{10125} \\approx 39.64523456... $$\nRounding to four significant figures, the ratio is $39.65$.
