The concepts of air conduction, bone conduction, air-bone gap (ABG), pure-tone average (PTA), and otosclerosis are fundamental and accurately described. The provided audiometric data are clinically plausible for a patient with conductive hearing loss due to stapes fixation.\n- **Well-Posed**: The problem is clearly structured with defined tasks, given data, and explicit formulas or calculation rules. All required information is present, and the tasks lead to a single, unique solution.\n- **Objective**: The problem statement is based on quantitative data and standard clinical definitions. It is free from subjective, ambiguous, or opinion-based language.\nThe problem is deemed complete, consistent, and scientifically valid.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. A full solution will be provided.\n\n**Solution**\n\n**Task 1: Definitions of Air-Bone Gap (ABG) and Pure-Tone Average (PTA)**\nThe auditory system can be stimulated through two primary pathways. Air conduction (AC) involves sound traveling through the outer ear (ear canal), middle ear (tympanic membrane and ossicles), and into the inner ear (cochlea). Bone conduction (BC) bypasses the outer and middle ear, transmitting sound vibrations directly through the bones of the skull to the cochlea.\n\n- The **Air-Bone Gap (ABG)** at a specific frequency is defined as the difference between the air-conduction hearing threshold and the bone-conduction hearing threshold, both measured in decibels hearing level (dB HL). Mathematically, if $AC_f$ and $BC_f$ are the thresholds at frequency $f$, the ABG is $\\Delta_{\\text{ABG}}(f) = AC_f - BC_f$. The ABG quantifies the loss of hearing sensitivity that is attributable to a dysfunction in the conductive pathway (i.e., the outer or middle ear). In otosclerosis, fixation of the stapes bone in the middle ear impedes sound transmission, creating a significant ABG.\n\n- The **Pure-Tone Average (PTA)** is a summary metric of hearing sensitivity, calculated as the arithmetic mean of hearing thresholds at a specified set of standard frequencies. It can be calculated for either air-conduction or bone-conduction thresholds. It provides a single value that is often used to classify the degree of hearing loss.\n\n**Task 2: Computation of Air-Bone Gaps and Average ABG**\nUsing the provided thresholds, we compute the ABG at each frequency:\n- At $f_1 = 500$ Hz: $\\Delta_{\\text{ABG}}(500) = AC_1 - BC_1 = 50 - 20 = 30$ dB.\n- At $f_2 = 1000$ Hz: $\\Delta_{\\text{ABG}}(1000) = AC_2 - BC_2 = 45 - 15 = 30$ dB.\n- At $f_3 = 2000$ Hz: $\\Delta_{\\text{ABG}}(2000) = AC_3 - BC_3 = 50 - 25 = 25$ dB.\n- At $f_4 = 3000$ Hz: $\\Delta_{\\text{ABG}}(3000) = AC_4 - BC_4 = 40 - 15 = 25$ dB.\n\nThe average ABG, denoted $\\overline{\\Delta}_{\\text{ABG}}$, across the specified frequencies ($500$, $1000$, $2000$, and $3000$ Hz) is the arithmetic mean of these values:\n$$\n\\overline{\\Delta}_{\\text{ABG}} = \\frac{\\Delta_{\\text{ABG}}(500) + \\Delta_{\\text{ABG}}(1000) + \\Delta_{\\text{ABG}}(2000) + \\Delta_{\\text{ABG}}(3000)}{4}\n$$\n$$\n\\overline{\\Delta}_{\\text{ABG}} = \\frac{30 + 30 + 25 + 25}{4} = \\frac{110}{4} = 27.5 \\text{ dB}\n$$\n\n**Task 3: Computation of the Bone-Conduction PTA**\nThe three-frequency bone-conduction PTA ($PTA_{BC}$) is calculated using the bone-conduction thresholds at frequencies of $0.5$, $1$, and $2$ kilohertz (i.e., $500$ Hz, $1000$ Hz, and $2000$ Hz).\n$$\nPTA_{BC} = \\frac{BC_{500} + BC_{1000} + BC_{2000}}{3}\n$$\nUsing the provided data, where $BC_{500}=20$, $BC_{1000}=15$, and $BC_{2000}=25$:\n$$\nPTA_{BC} = \\frac{20 + 15 + 25}{3} = \\frac{60}{3} = 20 \\text{ dB HL}\n$$\n\n**Task 4: Calculation of Candidacy Margin, $M$**\nFirst, we assess if the patient meets the criteria for stapes surgery.\n- Criterion $1$: Is the average ABG at least $20$ dB?\nOur calculated $\\overline{\\Delta}_{\\text{ABG}}$ is $27.5$ dB. Since $27.5 \\ge 20$, this criterion is met.\n- Criterion $2$: Is the bone-conduction PTA no worse than $30$ dB HL (i.e., $PTA_{BC} \\le 30$ dB HL)?\nOur calculated $PTA_{BC}$ is $20$ dB HL. Since $20 \\le 30$, this criterion is also met.\n\nThe patient is a candidate for surgery. The candidacy margin, $M$, is defined as $M = \\overline{\\Delta}_{\\text{ABG}} - 20$.\nSubstituting our calculated value for the average ABG:\n$$\nM = 27.5 - 20 = 7.5 \\text{ dB}\n$$\nThe problem requires the final answer to be rounded to four significant figures. Therefore, $M = 7.500$ dB.",

            "problem": "A patient with otosclerosis presents with a conductive component characterized by an air–bone gap of magnitude 20 decibel (dB) at a fixed test frequency, under the same incident sound field at the tympanic membrane preoperatively and postoperatively. Let the stapes footplate displacement amplitudes under this fixed acoustic drive be $A_{\\mathrm{pre}}$ before stapes surgery and $A_{\\mathrm{post}}$ after successful stapes surgery, respectively. Assume the middle ear–cochlea system is operating in the small-signal linear regime at this frequency and that the acoustic power delivered into the cochlea is proportional to the square of the stapes footplate displacement amplitude.

            "solution": "The problem requires the determination of the numeric factor by which the postoperative stapes footplate displacement amplitude, denoted as $A_{\\mathrm{post}}$, must exceed the preoperative amplitude, $A_{\\mathrm{pre}}$, to close a conductive hearing loss of magnitude $L = 20$ dB.\n\nThe relationship between the decibel level $L$ and the ratio of postoperative power $P_{\\mathrm{post}}$ to preoperative power $P_{\\mathrm{pre}}$ delivered to the cochlea is given as:\n$$L = 10 \\log_{10}\\!\\left(\\frac{P_{\\mathrm{post}}}{P_{\\mathrm{pre}}}\\right)$$\nWe are given that the air–bone gap to be closed is $L = 20$ dB. Substituting this value into the equation yields:\n$$20 = 10 \\log_{10}\\!\\left(\\frac{P_{\\mathrm{post}}}{P_{\\mathrm{pre}}}\\right)$$\nTo isolate the logarithmic term, we divide both sides by $10$:\n$$2 = \\log_{10}\\!\\left(\\frac{P_{\\mathrm{post}}}{P_{\\mathrm{pre}}}\\right)$$\nBy the definition of a base-$10$ logarithm, this equation can be expressed in exponential form:\n$$\\frac{P_{\\mathrm{post}}}{P_{\\mathrm{pre}}} = 10^2$$\n$$\\frac{P_{\\mathrm{post}}}{P_{\\mathrm{pre}}} = 100$$\nThis signifies that a $20$ dB improvement corresponds to a $100$-fold increase in the acoustic power delivered to the cochlea.\n\nThe problem also states a crucial physical relationship: the acoustic power $P$ delivered into the cochlea is proportional to the square of the stapes footplate displacement amplitude $A$. This can be written as:\n$$P \\propto A^2$$\nor, using a constant of proportionality $k$:\n$$P = k A^2$$\nThis constant $k$ depends on properties of the cochlea and the frequency of the sound, which are unchanged by the surgery on the stapes. Therefore, we can write the preoperative and postoperative powers as:\n$$P_{\\mathrm{pre}} = k A_{\\mathrm{pre}}^2$$\n$$P_{\\mathrm{post}} = k A_{\\mathrm{post}}^2$$\nThe ratio of these powers is then:\n$$\\frac{P_{\\mathrm{post}}}{P_{\\mathrm{pre}}} = \\frac{k A_{\\mathrm{post}}^2}{k A_{\\mathrm{pre}}^2} = \\left(\\frac{A_{\\mathrm{post}}}{A_{\\mathrm{pre}}}\\right)^2$$\nWe can now equate our two expressions for the power ratio:\n$$\\left(\\frac{A_{\\mathrm{post}}}{A_{\\mathrm{pre}}}\\right)^2 = 100$$\nTo find the ratio of the amplitudes, $\\frac{A_{\\mathrm{post}}}{A_{\\mathrm{pre}}}$, we take the square root of both sides. Since amplitude is a non-negative physical quantity, we consider only the positive root:\n$$\\frac{A_{\\mathrm{post}}}{A_{\\mathrm{pre}}} = \\sqrt{100}$$\n$$\\frac{A_{\\mathrm{post}}}{A_{\\mathrm{pre}}} = 10$$\nTherefore, the stapes footplate displacement amplitude after successful surgery must be $10$ times greater than the preoperative amplitude to close a $20$ dB air–bone gap.",

Therefore, the transfer function $H(\\omega)$ is:\n$$H(\\omega) = \\frac{V_2}{P_e} = \\frac{i\\omega X_2}{P_e}$$\nSubstituting the expression for $X_2$:\n$$H(\\omega) = \\frac{i\\omega (k_2 + i\\omega c_2) A}{Z_{11}(\\omega) Z_{22}(\\omega) - (k_2 + i\\omega c_2)^2}$$\n\nThe final quantity to be computed is the magnitude of this complex transfer function, $|H(\\omega)|$. This is implemented by computing the complex values of $Z_{11}$, $Z_{22}$, and the coupling term $k_2 + i\\omega c_2$ for the parameters of each test case, substituting them into the expression for $H(\\omega)$, and then calculating the absolute value of the resulting complex number.\nThe provided test suite explores the model's behavior under nominal conditions, pathological conditions (otosclerosis), a post-surgical condition (stapedectomy), and at a different frequency, by systematically varying the parameters $f$, $k_3$, $m_2$, and $c_3$.",
