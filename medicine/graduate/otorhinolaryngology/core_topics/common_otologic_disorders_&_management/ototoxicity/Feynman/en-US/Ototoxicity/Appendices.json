This practice  explores the crucial concept of subclinical ototoxic injury by examining a scenario where physiological measures, specifically Distortion Product Otoacoustic Emissions (DPOAEs), reveal cochlear damage that is not yet apparent on a standard audiogram. Mastering this interpretation is vital for making timely clinical decisions that can preserve a patient's long-term hearing function.",

            "problem": "A patient with testicular germ cell tumor is undergoing platinum-based chemotherapy with cis-diamminedichloroplatinum (cisplatin). Baseline Distortion Product Otoacoustic Emissions (DPOAE) were robust across ultra-high-frequency primaries, with the second primary frequency $f_{2}$ spanning $10$–$12$ $\\mathrm{kHz}$. After two chemotherapy cycles, repeat monitoring demonstrates that DPOAE amplitudes at $f_{2}$ in the $10$–$12$ $\\mathrm{kHz}$ range are reduced by approximately $8$ $\\mathrm{dB}$ relative to baseline, while Pure-Tone Audiometry (PTA) thresholds from $0.25$ to $8$ $\\mathrm{kHz}$ remain within prior normal limits and tympanometry shows normal middle-ear pressure and compliance.

            "solution": "The problem statement will be validated by first extracting the given information and then assessing its scientific and logical integrity.\n\n### Step 1: Extract Givens\n- A patient with testicular germ cell tumor is undergoing chemotherapy with cis-diamminedichloroplatinum (cisplatin).\n- Baseline Distortion Product Otoacoustic Emissions (DPOAE) were robust.\n- The second primary frequency for DPOAE, $f_{2}$, spanned $10$–$12$ $\\mathrm{kHz}$.\n- After two chemotherapy cycles, DPOAE amplitudes at $f_{2}$ in the $10$–$12$ $\\mathrm{kHz}$ range are reduced by approximately $8$ $\\mathrm{dB}$ relative to baseline.\n- Pure-Tone Audiometry (PTA) thresholds from $0.25$ to $8$ $\\mathrm{kHz}$ remain within prior normal limits.\n- Tympanometry shows normal middle-ear pressure and compliance.\n- Middle-ear status and probe fit are verified.\n- Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) at the measured distortion product is adequate for interpretation.\n- Cumulative cisplatin exposure is approaching a typical threshold for ototoxic risk.\n- **Fundamental Basis 1:** Cochlear tonotopy: The basal cochlea encodes high frequencies, and outer hair cells (OHCs) mediate frequency-specific cochlear amplification.\n- **Fundamental Basis 2:** DPOAEs depend on OHC integrity near the cochlear place tuned to $f_{2}$; a reduced DPOAE amplitude indicates reduced OHC function.\n- **Fundamental Basis 3:** Platinum agents preferentially injure basal OHCs early, and objective physiologic changes often precede behavioral threshold shifts on PTA.\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\nThe problem statement is analyzed for validity based on the extracted givens.\n\n- **Scientifically Grounded:** The problem is firmly grounded in the established principles of audiology, otology, and oncology. The mechanism of cisplatin-induced ototoxicity, characterized by initial damage to outer hair cells in the basal (high-frequency) region of the cochlea, is a well-documented scientific fact. The use of DPOAEs and ultra-high-frequency audiometry for early detection of ototoxicity is standard clinical practice. The relationship between OHC function, DPOAEs, and PTA is described accurately.\n\n- **Well-Posed:** The problem is well-posed. It provides a clear clinical scenario with specific quantitative ($8$ $\\mathrm{dB}$ drop, frequency ranges) and qualitative (normal tympanometry, adequate SNR) data. The provided fundamental principles serve as the axioms for interpreting the data. A unique and logical conclusion regarding the patient's status and the appropriate course of action can be derived.\n\n- **Objective:** The language is clinical, precise, and objective. It avoids ambiguity and subjectivity. All terms used (DPOAE, PTA, tympanometry, OHC, cisplatin) are standard in the relevant medical and scientific fields.\n\nThe problem statement presents a coherent and realistic clinical case without scientific inaccuracies, contradictions, or missing critical information. It is a valid problem for which a solution can be derived.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is **valid**. Proceeding to the solution.\n\n### Derivation of Solution\nThe patient is receiving cisplatin, a known ototoxic agent. The core task is to interpret a set of audiological findings in this context.\n\n1.  **Analyze the Physiological Data:** The primary finding is an approximate $8$ $\\mathrm{dB}$ reduction in DPOAE amplitudes in the ultra-high-frequency range ($f_{2}$ from $10$ to $12$ $\\mathrm{kHz}$). According to Fundamental Basis 2, DPOAEs are generated by healthy outer hair cells (OHCs). A reduction in DPOAE amplitude directly signifies a reduction in OHC function, or OHC injury, at the cochlear location corresponding to the primary frequencies.\n\n2.  **Correlate with Cochlear Tonotopy:** According to Fundamental Basis 1, the basal region of the cochlea is responsible for processing high frequencies. The observed OHC dysfunction at $10$–$12$ $\\mathrm{kHz}$ thus localizes the injury to the basal turn of the cochlea.\n\n3.  **Integrate with Known Ototoxicity Patterns:** Fundamental Basis 3 states that platinum agents like cisplatin preferentially damage basal OHCs first. The observed pattern of OHC dysfunction located in the high-frequency (basal) region is the classic signature of early cisplatin-induced ototoxicity.\n\n4.  **Contrast Physiological and Behavioral Data:** While the physiological measure (DPOAE) shows a clear change, the behavioral measure (PTA) remains normal up to its tested limit of $8$ $\\mathrm{kHz}$. This discrepancy is explained by Fundamental Basis 3, which notes that objective physiologic changes (like DPOAE reduction) often precede behavioral threshold shifts on PTA. This means the damage is present but has not yet become severe enough to affect the patient's ability to hear pure tones at a clinical-threshold level within the standard audiometric range. This stage is defined as **subclinical** ototoxicity.\n\n5.  **Rule Out Confounding Factors:** The problem statement systematically excludes alternative explanations.\n    - Middle-ear dysfunction (conductive hearing loss) is ruled out by \"normal middle-ear pressure and compliance\" on tympanometry.\n    - Measurement error is ruled out by the statements that \"Middle-ear status and probe fit are verified\" and the \"Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) ... remains adequate for interpretation.\" A significant drop with good SNR confirms the change is physiological, not an artifact.\n\n6.  **Synthesize and Formulate Action Plan:** The collective evidence points unequivocally to early, subclinical ototoxic injury to the basal OHCs caused by cisplatin. This is a critical finding, as it is an early warning of potentially permanent and debilitating hearing loss. It is not benign variability, especially given the context of approaching a cumulative toxic dose. The appropriate clinical response is:\n    - **Acknowledge the finding:** Recognize this as a significant event.\n    - **Intensify monitoring:** To track the progression of damage, more frequent and targeted monitoring is required. This should include the tests that detected the change (DPOAEs) and behavioral tests in the affected frequency range (ultra-high-frequency audiometry, which tests above $8$ $\\mathrm{kHz}$).\n    - **Communicate with the care team:** The oncologist must be informed immediately. This allows for a collaborative discussion about the risks and benefits of continuing the current regimen versus modifying it (e.g., dose reduction, changing agents, adding otoprotective agents if applicable/available). This decision must balance cancer treatment efficacy against the quality-of-life impact of permanent hearing loss.\n\n### Evaluation of Options\n\n**A. Early, subclinical basal outer hair cell dysfunction consistent with initial ototoxic injury; intensify monitoring with serial ultra-high-frequency audiometry and DPOAE, review cumulative dose and co-risk factors, and promptly discuss potential regimen modification with the oncology team.**\nThis option perfectly aligns with the derived conclusion. It correctly identifies the condition as early, subclinical OHC dysfunction localized to the basal cochlea, consistent with ototoxicity. The recommended actions—intensified monitoring with the most sensitive tools for the affected region (UHF audiometry and DPOAE), reviewing risk factors, and urgent interdisciplinary communication with oncology—represent the standard of care for managing ototoxicity.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. Conductive hearing loss due to middle-ear effusion; proceed with tympanostomy tube placement and defer further ototoxicity monitoring.**\nThis option diagnoses a conductive hearing loss. This is directly contradicted by the given data that \"tympanometry shows normal middle-ear pressure and compliance,\" which rules out significant middle-ear effusion. The recommended action is therefore medically unwarranted.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. Central auditory processing disorder; initiate auditory training and maintain the current chemotherapy plan without change.**\nThis option attributes the issue to the central auditory system. However, a reduction in DPOAE amplitude is a definitive sign of peripheral (cochlear) OHC dysfunction, not a central disorder. Maintaining the chemotherapy plan without change would ignore a significant sign of progressive, permanent cochlear damage.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. Established clinical sensorineural hearing loss; fit immediate bilateral hearing aids and discontinue further physiologic monitoring.**\nThis option mischaracterizes the hearing loss as \"established clinical.\" It is subclinical, as the PTA in the standard frequency range ($0.25$ to $8$ $\\mathrm{kHz}$) is still normal. Hearing aids are not indicated at this stage. Discontinuing physiologic monitoring would be negligent, as it is the only way to track the progression of the subclinical damage.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**E. Benign test-retest variability; no change in monitoring frequency and reassess only if PTA thresholds exceed $25$ $\\mathrm{dB}$ hearing level at two adjacent frequencies.**\nThis option dismisses a significant finding. An $8$ $\\mathrm{dB}$ drop in DPOAE amplitude is a large change, and in the context of cisplatin administration, it is highly indicative of ototoxicity, not random variability. Waiting for PTA thresholds to worsen would mean allowing significant, irreversible damage to occur before taking any action, which defeats the purpose of early monitoring.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**",

Cisplatin is a well-established ototoxic agent. The described pathophysiology (basal cochlear vulnerability leading to high-frequency hearing loss) is accurate. The use of serial audiometry, tympanometry, and statistical analysis of test-retest reliability constitutes the standard of care for ototoxicity monitoring. The provided data and parameters are clinically realistic.\n- **Well-Posed:** The problem is well-posed. It provides quantitative data and a statistical model for measurement error, asking for a reasoned inference. This permits the derivation of a unique, stable, and meaningful conclusion.\n- **Objective:** The problem is stated with objective, quantitative data and clinical findings. It is free of subjective language.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is scientifically sound, well-posed, and objective. It is **valid**. A solution will be derived.\n\n### Derivation\nThe fundamental task is to differentiate a true change in hearing threshold (signal) from random measurement error (noise). The provided statistical model for a single measurement $M$ of a true threshold $H$ is $M = H + \\epsilon$, where the error $\\epsilon$ is a random variable from a Gaussian distribution, $\\epsilon \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0, \\sigma^2)$.\n\nWe are interested in the change in threshold between two time points, for instance, between the baseline measurement $M_0$ and a subsequent measurement $M_i$. The observed change is $\\Delta M_i = M_i - M_0$. If there is no true change in hearing (i.e., the null hypothesis $H_0: H_i = H_0$ is true), then the observed change is solely due to measurement error:\n$$ \\Delta M_i = (H_i + \\epsilon_i) - (H_0 + \\epsilon_0) = \\epsilon_i - \\epsilon_0 $$\nSince the errors $\\epsilon_i$ and $\\epsilon_0$ are independent and identically distributed, the variance of their difference is the sum of their variances:\n$$ \\mathrm{Var}(\\Delta M_i) = \\mathrm{Var}(\\epsilon_i - \\epsilon_0) = \\mathrm{Var}(\\epsilon_i) + \\mathrm{Var}(\\epsilon_0) = \\sigma^2 + \\sigma^2 = 2\\sigma^2 $$\nThe standard deviation of the change due to measurement variability is therefore:\n$$ \\sigma_{\\Delta} = \\sqrt{2\\sigma^2} = \\sqrt{2}\\sigma $$\nTo declare a change statistically significant, the observed change must be unlikely to have occurred by chance. A common criterion uses a $95\\%$ confidence level, corresponding to approximately $1.96$ standard deviations from the mean for a two-tailed test. A significant change would thus be one where $|\\Delta M_i| > 1.96\\sigma_{\\Delta} = 1.96\\sqrt{2}\\sigma \\approx 2.77\\sigma$. Clinical practice often uses simplified but related criteria.\n\nLet us calculate the standard deviation of the difference for the two frequency ranges:\n1.  **Conventional Frequencies ($4\\,\\mathrm{kHz}$, $8\\,\\mathrm{kHz}$):** $\\sigma = \\sigma_{\\mathrm{HL}} = 4\\,\\mathrm{dB}$.\n    $$ \\sigma_{\\Delta, \\mathrm{HL}} = \\sqrt{2} \\times 4\\,\\mathrm{dB} \\approx 5.66\\,\\mathrm{dB} $$\n    A statistically significant change at the $95\\%$ confidence level would be greater than $1.96 \\times 5.66\\,\\mathrm{dB} \\approx 11.1\\,\\mathrm{dB}$. A common clinical rule of thumb is a change of $10\\,\\mathrm{dB}$, which corresponds to approximately $1.77\\sigma_{\\Delta, \\mathrm{HL}}$.\n2.  **UHF Frequencies ($12\\,\\mathrm{kHz}$, $14\\,\\mathrm{kHz}$):** $\\sigma = \\sigma_{\\mathrm{UHF}} = 7\\,\\mathrm{dB}$.\n    $$ \\sigma_{\\Delta, \\mathrm{UHF}} = \\sqrt{2} \\times 7\\,\\mathrm{dB} \\approx 9.90\\,\\mathrm{dB} $$\n    A statistically significant change at the $95\\%$ confidence level would be greater than $1.96 \\times 9.90\\,\\mathrm{dB} \\approx 19.4\\,\\mathrm{dB}$. A common clinical rule of thumb is a change of $20\\,\\mathrm{dB}$.\n\nNow we analyze the threshold changes from baseline ($T0$) to the latest follow-up ($T3$):\n-   **At $4\\,\\mathrm{kHz}$:** Change is $T3 - T0 = 16 - 10 = 6\\,\\mathrm{dB}$. This change is approximately $1.06\\sigma_{\\Delta, \\mathrm{HL}}$. The fluctuations ($T1=15$, $T2=12$) are small and do not show a clear trend. This is consistent with measurement variability.\n-   **At $8\\,\\mathrm{kHz}$:** Change is $T3 - T0 = 35 - 20 = 15\\,\\mathrm{dB}$. This change is approximately $2.65\\sigma_{\\Delta, \\mathrm{HL}}$. It exceeds the $11.1\\,\\mathrm{dB}$ threshold for statistical significance at the $95\\%$ confidence level. The pattern is also progressive ($20 \\rightarrow 25 \\rightarrow 32 \\rightarrow 35$). This is strongly indicative of a true threshold shift.\n-   **At $12\\,\\mathrm{kHz}$:** Change is $T3 - T0 = 62 - 45 = 17\\,\\mathrm{dB}$. This change is approximately $1.72\\sigma_{\\Delta, \\mathrm{UHF}}$. While it does not strictly meet the $19.4\\,\\mathrm{dB}$ ($95\\%$ confidence) criterion, it is substantial and part of a progressive trend ($45 \\rightarrow 58 \\rightarrow 60 \\rightarrow 62$).\n-   **At $14\\,\\mathrm{kHz}$:** Change is $T3 - T0 = 78 - 60 = 18\\,\\mathrm{dB}$. This change is approximately $1.82\\sigma_{\\Delta, \\mathrm{UHF}}$. Similar to $12\\,\\mathrm{kHz}$, this is a large, progressive change ($60 \\rightarrow 72 \\rightarrow 75 \\rightarrow 78$) that is close to statistical significance.\n\n**Integration with Clinical Criteria and Pathophysiology:**\nCisplatin ototoxicity characteristically affects the basal turn of the cochlea first, causing sensorineural hearing loss that manifests initially in the ultra-high and high frequencies. The observed pattern—no significant change at $4\\,\\mathrm{kHz}$, significant change at $8\\,\\mathrm{kHz}$, and large, progressive changes at $12\\,\\mathrm{kHz}$ and $14\\,\\mathrm{kHz}$—is the classic signature of this process.\n\nFurthermore, professional organizations like the American Speech-Language-Hearing Association (ASHA) have established criteria for identifying significant ototoxic change. A widely used criterion is a threshold shift from baseline of $\\ge 10\\,\\mathrm{dB}$ at two adjacent test frequencies.\nLet's apply this to the $T0 \\rightarrow T3$ data:\n-   Change at $8\\,\\mathrm{kHz}$ is $15\\,\\mathrm{dB}$ ($\\ge 10\\,\\mathrm{dB}$).\n-   Change at $12\\,\\mathrm{kHz}$ is $17\\,\\mathrm{dB}$ ($\\ge 10\\,\\mathrm{dB}$).\n-   Change at $14\\,\\mathrm{kHz}$ is $18\\,\\mathrm{dB}$ ($\\ge 10\\,\\mathrm{dB}$).\n\nThe criterion is met for the adjacent frequency pair $8\\,\\mathrm{kHz}$ and $12\\,\\mathrm{kHz}$, and also for the pair $12\\,\\mathrm{kHz}$ and $14\\,\\mathrm{kHz}$. This confirms that the observed changes meet accepted clinical criteria for ototoxicity.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. The pattern is best explained by measurement variability; continue routine monitoring without escalation and do not notify oncology unless future changes exceed $\\pm 5\\,\\mathrm{dB}$ at any single frequency.**\nThis interpretation is incorrect. The analysis above demonstrates that the changes at $8\\,\\mathrm{kHz}$, $12\\,\\mathrm{kHz}$, and $14\\,\\mathrm{kHz}$ are not consistent with measurement variability alone. The change at $8\\,\\mathrm{kHz}$ is statistically significant, and the overall pattern across multiple adjacent high frequencies meets established clinical criteria. The proposed action threshold of $\\pm 5\\,\\mathrm{dB}$ is far too small, as it is less than one standard deviation of the measurement difference ($\\sigma_{\\Delta, \\mathrm{HL}} \\approx 5.66\\,\\mathrm{dB}$), and therefore falls within the expected noise of the measurement. This option represents a dangerous misinterpretation of the data.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**B. The pattern is best explained by true ototoxic progression; it meets accepted clinical criteria for ototoxic change across adjacent high frequencies. Notify oncology to consider cisplatin dose modification or ototoxicity mitigation, initiate hearing conservation counseling, and intensify monitoring with closer intervals.**\nThis interpretation is correct. The pattern of progressive, high-frequency threshold shifts is characteristic of cisplatin ototoxicity. As derived, the magnitude of the changes meets the ASHA criterion for a significant ototoxic event ($\\ge 10\\,\\mathrm{dB}$ shift at two adjacent frequencies). The recommended clinical actions—notifying the oncology team for potential treatment modification, counseling the patient about the hearing loss and ways to protect their remaining hearing, and increasing the frequency of monitoring—are the appropriate and standard response to the confirmation of ototoxicity.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**C. The pattern suggests a transient conductive component; perform middle-ear evaluation and defer any ototoxicity conclusion until the conductive issue resolves.**\nThis is incorrect. The problem statement explicitly provides that otoscopy was normal and tympanograms were Type A at every visit. These findings are the clinical standard for ruling out a significant middle ear (conductive) pathology. There is no evidence to support the presence of a conductive component. The hearing loss pattern is entirely consistent with sensorineural damage from cisplatin.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. The data are not interpretable because UHF thresholds are in $\\mathrm{dB\\,SPL}$ rather than $\\mathrm{dB\\,HL}$; without unit matching, no inference about ototoxicity can be made even with serial measurements.**\nThis is incorrect. For serial monitoring, the critical factor is the consistency of the measurement method and unit over time for a given frequency, not that all frequencies share the same unit. A change of a certain number of decibels ($\\mathrm{dB}$) represents the same logarithmic ratio, whether the reference level is the average normal threshold (HL) or a fixed physical pressure (SPL). It is standard and accepted practice to measure and report UHF thresholds in $\\mathrm{dB\\,SPL}$ because standardized reference equivalent threshold sound pressure levels (RETSPLs) for converting to $\\mathrm{dB\\,HL}$ do not exist for all UHF transducers and frequencies. Comparing $\\mathrm{dB\\,SPL}$ at time $T0$ to $\\mathrm{dB\\,SPL}$ at time $T3$ is a valid way to quantify change.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**",

A full solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe primary task is to derive and evaluate the cumulative risk $R(T)$. The derivation proceeds from first principles as laid out in the problem statement.\n\nThe cumulative risk $R(T)$ is given by:\n$$\nR(T) = 1 - \\exp(-\\Lambda(T))\n$$\nwhere $\\Lambda(T)$ is the cumulative hazard, defined as the time integral of the instantaneous hazard rate $\\lambda(t)$:\n$$\n\\Lambda(T) = \\int_{0}^{T} \\lambda(t)\\,\\mathrm{d}t\n$$\nThe instantaneous hazard rate is given as $\\lambda(t) = \\alpha\\,C(t) + \\beta\\,I + \\gamma\\,C(t) I$. We can re-arrange this by factoring out $C(t)$:\n$$\n\\lambda(t) = (\\alpha + \\gamma I)C(t) + \\beta I\n$$\nThe drug concentration $C(t)$ follows first-order elimination kinetics: $C(t) = C_{0} \\exp(-kt)$. Substituting this into the expression for $\\lambda(t)$:\n$$\n\\lambda(t) = (\\alpha + \\gamma I)C_{0} \\exp(-kt) + \\beta I\n$$\nNow, we integrate $\\lambda(t)$ from $t=0$ to $t=T$ to find the cumulative hazard $\\Lambda(T)$:\n$$\n\\Lambda(T) = \\int_{0}^{T} \\left[ (\\alpha + \\gamma I)C_{0} \\exp(-kt) + \\beta I \\right] \\mathrm{d}t\n$$\nWe can separate the integral into two parts:\n$$\n\\Lambda(T) = (\\alpha + \\gamma I)C_{0} \\int_{0}^{T} \\exp(-kt)\\,\\mathrm{d}t + \\beta I \\int_{0}^{T} \\mathrm{d}t\n$$\nEvaluating the integrals:\n$$\n\\int_{0}^{T} \\exp(-kt)\\,\\mathrm{d}t = \\left[ -\\frac{1}{k}\\exp(-kt) \\right]_{0}^{T} = -\\frac{1}{k}(\\exp(-kT) - \\exp(0)) = \\frac{1}{k}(1 - \\exp(-kT))\n$$\n$$\n\\int_{0}^{T} \\mathrm{d}t = [t]_{0}^{T} = T\n$$\nSubstituting these results back into the expression for $\\Lambda(T)$:\n$$\n\\Lambda(T) = (\\alpha + \\gamma I)\\frac{C_{0}}{k}(1 - \\exp(-kT)) + \\beta I T\n$$\nFinally, substituting this expression for $\\Lambda(T)$ into the equation for $R(T)$ gives the closed-form analytic solution for the cumulative risk:\n$$\nR(T) = 1 - \\exp\\left( - \\left[ (\\alpha + \\gamma I)\\frac{C_{0}}{k}(1 - \\exp(-kT)) + \\beta I T \\right] \\right)\n$$\n### Numerical Evaluation\n\nWe now evaluate this expression using the provided parameter values.\n\nFirst, we calculate the intermediate parameters $k$ and $I$.\n\nThe elimination rate constant $k$ is:\n$$\nk = \\frac{\\ln(2)}{h_{1/2}} = \\frac{\\ln(2)}{2\\,\\mathrm{h}}\n$$\n\nThe acoustic intensity $I$ is derived from the Sound Pressure Level $L_{noise}$:\n$$\nL_{noise} = 10 \\log_{10}\\left(\\frac{I}{I_{0}}\\right)\n$$\n$$\n95 = 10 \\log_{10}\\left(\\frac{I}{10^{-12}\\,\\mathrm{W}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-2}}\\right)\n$$\n$$\n9.5 = \\log_{10}\\left(\\frac{I}{10^{-12}}\\right)\n$$\n$$\n10^{9.5} = \\frac{I}{10^{-12}}\n$$\n$$\nI = 10^{9.5} \\times 10^{-12} = 10^{-2.5}\\,\\mathrm{W}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-2}\n$$\n\nNext, we evaluate the components of the exponent $\\Lambda(T)$. The term $kT$ is:\n$$\nkT = \\frac{\\ln(2)}{2} \\times 2 = \\ln(2)\n$$\nTherefore, the term $(1 - \\exp(-kT))$ becomes:\n$$\n1 - \\exp(-kT) = 1 - \\exp(-\\ln(2)) = 1 - \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{1}{2}\n$$\nThe term $C_{0}/k$ is:\n$$\n\\frac{C_{0}}{k} = \\frac{8}{\\ln(2)/2} = \\frac{16}{\\ln(2)}\n$$\nNow, we can assemble the expression for $\\Lambda(T)$:\n$$\n\\Lambda(T) = \\left(\\alpha + \\gamma I\\right)\\frac{16}{\\ln(2)}\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) + \\beta I T = \\left(\\alpha + \\gamma I\\right)\\frac{8}{\\ln(2)} + \\beta I T\n$$\nSubstituting the numerical values for $\\alpha$, $\\beta$, $\\gamma$, $I$, and $T$:\n$$\n\\alpha = 1.5 \\times 10^{-3}\n$$\n$$\n\\beta = 1.0 \\times 10^{-2}\n$$\n$$\n\\gamma = 5.0 \\times 10^{-3}\n$$\n$$\nI = 10^{-2.5}\n$$\n$$\nT = 2\n$$\nThe synergy term $\\gamma I$:\n$$\n\\gamma I = (5.0 \\times 10^{-3}) \\times 10^{-2.5} = 5.0 \\times 10^{-5.5}\n$$\nThe drug-related component of $\\Lambda(T)$:\n$$\n(\\alpha + \\gamma I)\\frac{8}{\\ln(2)} = (1.5 \\times 10^{-3} + 5.0 \\times 10^{-5.5}) \\frac{8}{\\ln(2)}\n$$\nThe noise-only component of $\\Lambda(T)$:\n$$\n\\beta I T = (1.0 \\times 10^{-2}) \\times 10^{-2.5} \\times 2 = 2.0 \\times 10^{-4.5}\n$$\nSo, the total cumulative hazard is:\n$$\n\\Lambda(T) = \\frac{8}{\\ln(2)}(1.5 \\times 10^{-3} + 5.0 \\times 10^{-5.5}) + 2.0 \\times 10^{-4.5}\n$$\nNumerically:\n$$\n10^{-2.5} \\approx 3.162278 \\times 10^{-3}\n$$\n$$\n10^{-4.5} \\approx 3.162278 \\times 10^{-5}\n$$\n$$\n10^{-5.5} \\approx 3.162278 \\times 10^{-6}\n$$\n$$\n\\ln(2) \\approx 0.693147\n$$\n$$\n\\Lambda(T) \\approx \\frac{8}{0.693147}(1.5 \\times 10^{-3} + 5.0 \\times 10^{-3} \\times 3.162278 \\times 10^{-3}) + (1.0 \\times 10^{-2}) \\times (3.162278 \\times 10^{-3}) \\times 2\n$$\nA more direct calculation:\n$$\n\\Lambda(T) = \\frac{8}{0.693147}(0.0015 + 5.0 \\times 3.162278 \\times 10^{-6}) + 2.0 \\times 3.162278 \\times 10^{-5}\n$$\n$$\n\\Lambda(T) \\approx 11.5415(0.0015 + 0.000015811) + 0.000063246\n$$\n$$\n\\Lambda(T) \\approx 11.5415(0.001515811) + 0.000063246\n$$\n$$\n\\Lambda(T) \\approx 0.0174950 + 0.000063246 \\approx 0.0175582\n$$\nFinally, we compute the risk $R(T)$:\n$$\nR(T) = 1 - \\exp(-\\Lambda(T)) \\approx 1 - \\exp(-0.0175582)\n$$\n$$\n\\exp(-0.0175582) \\approx 0.9825958\n$$\n$$\nR(T) \\approx 1 - 0.9825958 = 0.0174042\n$$\nRounding to four significant figures, we get $0.01740$.",
