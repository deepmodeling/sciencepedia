This practice introduces a formal method for this decision-making process, using expected utility theory to compare irrigation and microsuction. By assigning quantitative values to outcomes, you will learn to systematically weigh the benefits of cerumen clearance against the potential for complications, guiding you toward the optimal evidence-based choice for your patient .",

            "problem": "A patient with cerumen impaction is eligible for either ear canal irrigation or microsuction. For the purpose of decision analysis, assume a von Neumann–Morgenstern expected utility framework with the following modeling primitives: (i) define a binary random variable for successful complete cerumen clearance and a binary random variable for the occurrence of a clinically significant complication (for example, canal laceration requiring medical treatment); (ii) assign additive utilities to these outcomes, with $+1$ utility for successful clearance and $-5$ utility for a complication; and (iii) assign a baseline utility of $0$ to all other aspects of the episode. Assume linearity of expectation and that the expected utility of a strategy is the expectation of the additive utility over its outcome distribution. You are given the following well-tested performance characteristics consistent with otorhinolaryngology practice: irrigation achieves successful clearance with probability $0.85$ and has a complication risk of $0.03$; microsuction achieves successful clearance with probability $0.90$ and has a complication risk of $0.02$. Under the stated assumptions and without introducing any additional parameters, derive from first principles the expected net utility for each strategy and compute the expected net utility difference defined as $$\\Delta = \\text{Expected Net Utility of Microsuction} - \\text{Expected Net Utility of Irrigation}.$$ Provide your final answer as a single real number.

The device under test delivers a constant static gauge pressure of $6$ psi at the nozzle and a constant volumetric flow rate of $100$ milliliters per minute (mL/min).
