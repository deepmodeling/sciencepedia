            "solution": "The problem requires a multi-step analysis involving fluid dynamics principles for flow in a cylindrical conduit. The primary governing relations are the Hagen-Poiseuille equation for laminar flow and the definition of the Reynolds number.\n\nFirst, we establish the relationship between volumetric flow rate $Q$, pressure drop $\\Delta P$, and the geometric and fluid properties for laminar flow in a cylindrical pipe. The Hagen-Poiseuille equation provides this relationship:\n$$Q = \\frac{\\pi r^4 \\Delta P}{8 \\eta L}$$\nwhere $r$ is the tube radius, $\\Delta P$ is the pressure drop across the length $L$, and $\\eta$ is the dynamic viscosity of the fluid.\n\nSecond, we must verify that the flow regime is laminar. The flow regime is characterized by the dimensionless Reynolds number, $Re$, defined for a cylindrical pipe as:\n$$Re = \\frac{\\rho v D}{\\eta}$$\nwhere $\\rho$ is the fluid density, $v$ is the average flow velocity, and $D$ is the hydraulic diameter of the pipe, which is $D=2r$ for a circular cross-section. The average velocity $v$ is the volumetric flow rate $Q$ divided by the cross-sectional area $A = \\pi r^2$:\n$$v = \\frac{Q}{A} = \\frac{Q}{\\pi r^2}$$\nSubstituting the expressions for $v$ and $D$ into the Reynolds number definition yields:\n$$Re = \\frac{\\rho (\\frac{Q}{\\pi r^2}) (2r)}{\\eta} = \\frac{2 \\rho Q}{\\pi r \\eta}$$\nFlow is generally considered laminar for $Re < 2000$.\n\nThe first task is to calculate the pressure drop $\\Delta P_{\\text{req}}$ needed to achieve the target flow rate $Q_{\\text{target}}$ and to verify that the flow is laminar. From the Hagen-Poiseuille equation, we solve for $\\Delta P$:\n$$\\Delta P_{\\text{req}} = \\frac{8 \\eta L Q_{\\text{target}}}{\\pi r^4}$$\nWe then calculate the Reynolds number for this flow rate:\n$$Re_{\\text{target}} = \\frac{2 \\rho Q_{\\text{target}}}{\\pi r \\eta}$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$L = 0.036\\,\\mathrm{m}$\n$r = 4.0\\times 10^{-4}\\,\\mathrm{m}$\n$\\eta = 1.8\\times 10^{-5}\\,\\mathrm{Pa\\,s}$\n$\\rho = 1.2\\,\\mathrm{kg\\,m^{-3}}$\n$Q_{\\text{target}} = 2.0\\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{m^{3}\\,s^{-1}}$\n\nThe Reynolds number for the target flow is:\n$$Re_{\\text{target}} = \\frac{2 (1.2\\,\\mathrm{kg\\,m^{-3}}) (2.0\\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{m^{3}\\,s^{-1}})}{\\pi (4.0\\times 10^{-4}\\,\\mathrm{m}) (1.8\\times 10^{-5}\\,\\mathrm{Pa\\,s})} \\approx 212.2$$\nSince $Re_{\\text{target}} \\approx 212$, which is significantly less than the critical Reynolds number $Re_{\\text{crit}} = 2000$, the flow at the target rate is indeed laminar, and the use of the Hagen-Poiseuille equation is justified.\nThe pressure drop required to achieve this flow is:\n$$\\Delta P_{\\text{req}} = \\frac{8 (1.8\\times 10^{-5}\\,\\mathrm{Pa\\,s}) (0.036\\,\\mathrm{m}) (2.0\\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{m^{3}\\,s^{-1}})}{\\pi (4.0\\times 10^{-4}\\,\\mathrm{m})^4} \\approx 129\\,\\mathrm{Pa}$$\n\nThe next task is to determine the safe upper limit for the applied pressure, $\\Delta P_{\\text{safe}}$.

We can establish a direct relationship between $\\Delta P$ and $Re$ by combining the two fundamental equations. From the Reynolds number equation, we can express $Q$ in terms of $Re$:\n$$Q = \\frac{\\pi r \\eta Re}{2 \\rho}$$\nSubstituting this expression for $Q$ into the Hagen-Poiseuille equation for $\\Delta P$:\n$$\\Delta P = \\frac{8 \\eta L}{\\pi r^4} Q = \\frac{8 \\eta L}{\\pi r^4} \\left( \\frac{\\pi r \\eta Re}{2 \\rho} \\right)$$\nSimplifying this expression yields a direct relationship between the pressure drop and the Reynolds number:\n$$\\Delta P = \\frac{4 \\eta^2 L Re}{\\rho r^3}$$\nWe can now calculate $\\Delta P_{\\text{crit}}$ by setting $Re = Re_{\\text{crit}} = 2000$:\n$$\\Delta P_{\\text{crit}} = \\frac{4 \\eta^2 L Re_{\\text{crit}}}{\\rho r^3}$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$\\Delta P_{\\text{crit}} = \\frac{4 (1.8\\times 10^{-5}\\,\\mathrm{Pa\\,s})^2 (0.036\\,\\mathrm{m}) (2000)}{(1.2\\,\\mathrm{kg\\,m^{-3}}) (4.0\\times 10^{-4}\\,\\mathrm{m})^3}$$\n$$\\Delta P_{\\text{crit}} = \\frac{4 (3.24\\times 10^{-10}\\,\\mathrm{Pa^2\\,s^2}) (0.036\\,\\mathrm{m}) (2000)}{(1.2\\,\\mathrm{kg\\,m^{-3}}) (6.4\\times 10^{-11}\\,\\mathrm{m^3})}$$\n$$\\Delta P_{\\text{crit}} = \\frac{9.3312\\times 10^{-8}\\,\\mathrm{Pa^2\\,s^2\\,m}}{7.68\\times 10^{-11}\\,\\mathrm{kg\\,m^{-3}\\,m^3}} = 1215\\,\\mathrm{Pa}$$\nConverting this pressure to kilopascals gives:\n$$\\Delta P_{\\text{crit}} = 1.215\\,\\mathrm{kPa}$$\nThe problem defines the safe upper limit $\\Delta P_{\\text{safe}}$ as the minimum of this value and the physiological cap $\\Delta P_{\\text{phys}} = 2.0\\,\\mathrm{kPa}$.\n$$\\Delta P_{\\text{safe}} = \\min(\\Delta P_{\\text{crit}}, \\Delta P_{\\text{phys}}) = \\min(1.215\\,\\mathrm{kPa}, 2.0\\,\\mathrm{kPa})$$\n$$\\Delta P_{\\text{safe}} = 1.215\\,\\mathrm{kPa}$$\nThe problem requires the final answer to be rounded to three significant figures.\n$$\\Delta P_{\\text{safe}} \\approx 1.22\\,\\mathrm{kPa}$$\nThis value represents the maximum safe pressure that can be applied during the Valsalva maneuver under the given model conditions, ensuring the flow remains laminar and does not exceed the physiological pressure constraint.",

            "problem": "A professional scuba diver presents after a rapid ascent with symptoms consistent with Eustachian Tube (ET) dysfunction and possible barotrauma. Tympanometry using a low-frequency probe tone of $226$ Hz shows the tympanogram peak occurring at an ear canal pressure of $-150$ decapascals (daPa) relative to ambient, and the measured static admittance at the peak is reduced by $40\\%$ compared to the diver’s previous baseline in the same ear. Using a lumped-element model of the external ear canal (EC)–tympanic membrane (TM)–middle ear (ME) system at low frequency, where the static admittance $Y(0)$ approximates the compliance-dominated response and is inversely related to an effective stiffness $k_{\\text{eff}}$, reason from first principles about (i) the type of mechanical load change on the TM implied by the admittance reduction in the context of ET dysfunction with negative ME pressure, and (ii) the ear canal pressure change necessary to restore peak admittance by pressure equalization. Assume the following fundamentals: maximum admittance occurs when the trans-tympanic pressure difference is zero, that is, when $P_{\\text{EC}} = P_{\\text{ME}}$, and at low frequency $Y(0) \\propto \\frac{1}{k_{\\text{eff}}}$ for a stiffness-dominated system.

Express your final numerical answer for $\\Delta P_{\\text{EC}}$ in decapascals (daPa) and round your answer to three significant figures.",
            "solution": "The problem requires a two-part response: (i) a qualitative reasoning about the change in mechanical load on the tympanic membrane (TM), and (ii) a quantitative calculation of the change in ear canal pressure, $\\Delta P_{\\text{EC}}$, needed to achieve peak admittance.\n\n**(i) Mechanical Load Change**\n\nThe problem provides a relationship between the static acoustic admittance at low frequency, $Y(0)$, and the effective stiffness of the middle ear system, $k_{\\text{eff}}$. This relationship is given as an inverse proportionality:\n$$Y(0) \\propto \\frac{1}{k_{\\text{eff}}}$$\nAcoustic admittance is a measure of how easily sound energy is transmitted into the middle ear. In a stiffness-dominated system, higher stiffness impedes motion, thus reducing admittance.\n\nLet the diver's baseline static admittance be $Y_{\\text{baseline}}$ and the corresponding baseline effective stiffness be $k_{\\text{eff, baseline}}$. Let the newly measured peak admittance be $Y_{\\text{peak}}$ with its corresponding effective stiffness $k_{\\text{eff, peak}}$. According to the problem statement, the new peak admittance is reduced by $40\\%$ compared to the baseline. This can be expressed as:\n$$Y_{\\text{peak}} = (1 - 0.40) Y_{\\text{baseline}} = 0.60 Y_{\\text{baseline}}$$\nUsing the proportionality, we can write:\n$$Y_{\\text{peak}} = C \\frac{1}{k_{\\text{eff, peak}}} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad Y_{\\text{baseline}} = C \\frac{1}{k_{\\text{eff, baseline}}}$$\nwhere $C$ is a constant of proportionality.\n\nTaking the ratio of the peak to baseline admittance gives:\n$$\\frac{Y_{\\text{peak}}}{Y_{\\text{baseline}}} = \\frac{C / k_{\\text{eff, peak}}}{C / k_{\\text{eff, baseline}}} = \\frac{k_{\\text{eff, baseline}}}{k_{\\text{eff, peak}}}$$\nSubstituting the known reduction in admittance:\n$$0.60 = \\frac{k_{\\text{eff, baseline}}}{k_{\\text{eff, peak}}}$$\nSolving for the new effective stiffness, $k_{\\text{eff, peak}}$, we find:\n$$k_{\\text{eff, peak}} = \\frac{k_{\\text{eff, baseline}}}{0.60} \\approx 1.67 k_{\\text{eff, baseline}}$$\nThis result shows that the effective stiffness of the middle ear system has increased by approximately $67\\%$. An increase in stiffness constitutes an increase in the mechanical load on the system, making it harder to move. This increased stiffness is a pathological finding consistent with the clinical history of barotrauma. Potential causes include middle ear effusion (fluid in the middle ear space), which adds mass and damping but primarily increases the stiffness of the air cushion, or stiffening of the TM and ossicular chain due to inflammation or structural changes. This stiffness increase is measured at the admittance peak (where trans-tympanic pressure is zero), indicating it is an intrinsic change in the middle ear system, not merely a result of the TM being tensed by a pressure differential.\n\n**(ii) Ear Canal Pressure Change**\n\nThe second part of the problem asks for the signed change in ear canal pressure, $\\Delta P_{\\text{EC}}$, required to achieve the condition of peak admittance. The reference for this change is the ambient atmospheric pressure.\n\nThe fundamental principle for tympanometry is that the tympanic membrane-middle ear system has its maximum compliance (and thus maximum admittance at low frequency) when there is no pressure difference across the tympanic membrane. This condition is expressed as:\n$$P_{\\text{EC}} = P_{\\text{ME}}$$\nwhere $P_{\\text{EC}}$ is the pressure in the external ear canal and $P_{\\text{ME}}$ is the pressure in the middle ear. All pressures are measured relative to the ambient atmospheric pressure.\n\nThe problem states that the tympanogram peak is measured to occur at an ear canal pressure of $-150$ daPa. This is the value of $P_{\\text{EC}}$ at which the admittance is maximal for the current state of the ear. Let us denote this pressure as $P_{\\text{EC, peak}}$.\n$$P_{\\text{EC, peak}} = -150 \\text{ daPa}$$\nAccording to the principle of peak admittance, this ear canal pressure must be equal to the middle ear pressure. Therefore, the patient's middle ear pressure is:\n$$P_{\\text{ME}} = P_{\\text{EC, peak}} = -150 \\text{ daPa}$$\nThis significant negative middle ear pressure is a classic sign of Eustachian tube dysfunction.\n\nThe question asks for the change in ear canal pressure, $\\Delta P_{\\text{EC}}$, needed to reach this peak condition. The measurement starts with the ear canal at ambient pressure. We define the initial ear canal pressure, $P_{\\text{EC, initial}}$, as the ambient pressure, which is $0$ daPa relative to ambient.\n$$P_{\\text{EC, initial}} = 0 \\text{ daPa}$$\nThe final pressure, $P_{\\text{EC, final}}$, is the pressure at which the admittance peak is found.\n$$P_{\\text{EC, final}} = P_{\\text{EC, peak}} = -150 \\text{ daPa}$$\nThe change in pressure is the final pressure minus the initial pressure:\n$$\\Delta P_{\\text{EC}} = P_{\\text{EC, final}} - P_{\\text{EC, initial}}$$\n$$\\Delta P_{\\text{EC}} = (-150 \\text{ daPa}) - (0 \\text{ daPa}) = -150 \\text{ daPa}$$\nThe negative sign indicates that a depressurization (creation of a partial vacuum) of the external ear canal relative to the ambient pressure is necessary to equalize the negative pressure in the middle ear and achieve peak admittance. The value is given with what is typically considered three significant figures in this context, so no rounding is needed.",

For $P_{\\mathrm{NP}} = 1400\\,\\mathrm{Pa}$, the ET remains closed because $P_{\\mathrm{tm}} < P_{\\mathrm{open}}$, and there is no ventilation; for $P_{\\mathrm{NP}} = 3000\\,\\mathrm{Pa}$, although the ET opens, the middle ear pressure at $t = T$ remains below the injury threshold.**\n  The first part is demonstrably false. As calculated, for $P_{\\mathrm{NP}} = 1400\\,\\mathrm{Pa}$, $P_{\\mathrm{tm}} = 500\\,\\mathrm{Pa} > 200\\,\\mathrm{Pa}$, so the tube opens. The second part is also false. For $P_{\\mathrm{NP}} = 3000\\,\\mathrm{Pa}$, the pressure at $t=2\\,\\mathrm{s}$ is $\\approx 2911\\,\\mathrm{Pa}$, which is above the $1500\\,\\mathrm{Pa}$ injury threshold.\n\n- **B. For $P_{\\mathrm{NP}} = 1400\\,\\mathrm{Pa}$, the ET opens and achieves ventilation without exceeding the injury threshold by $t = T$; for $P_{\\mathrm{NP}} = 3000\\,\\mathrm{Pa}$, the ET opens and drives the middle ear pressure above the injury threshold by $t = T$, indicating likely barotrauma.**\n  This statement aligns perfectly with the results derived from the model. For $P_{\\mathrm{NP}} = 1400\\,\\mathrm{Pa}$, the calculation shows the ET opens and $P_{\\mathrm{ME}}(2\\,\\mathrm{s}) \\approx 771\\,\\mathrm{Pa} < 1500\\,\\mathrm{Pa}$. This supports the first clause. For $P_{\\mathrm{NP}} = 3000\\,\\mathrm{Pa}$, the calculation shows the ET opens and $P_{\\mathrm{ME}}(2\\,\\mathrm{s}) \\approx 2911\\,\\mathrm{Pa} > 1500\\,\\mathrm{Pa}$. This supports the second clause.\n\n- **C. Both $P_{\\mathrm{NP}} = 1400\\,\\mathrm{Pa}$ and $P_{\\mathrm{NP}} = 3000\\,\\mathrm{Pa}$ produce injury once the ET opens, because the final steady-state middle ear pressure equals the nasopharyngeal pressure and any opening necessarily produces barotrauma.**\n  This statement is flawed. For $P_{\\mathrm{NP}} = 1400\\,\\mathrm{Pa}$, the steady-state pressure is $1400\\,\\mathrm{Pa}$, which is below the injury threshold of $1500\\,\\mathrm{Pa}$. Thus, even at infinite time, injury would not occur in this case. Furthermore, the problem asks for the pressure at $t=2\\,\\mathrm{s}$. Our calculation for $P_{\\mathrm{NP}} = 1400\\,\\mathrm{Pa}$ showed no injury at $t=2\\,\\mathrm{s}$.\n\n- **D. Neither $P_{\\mathrm{NP}} = 1400\\,\\mathrm{Pa}$ nor $P_{\\mathrm{NP}} = 3000\\,\\mathrm{Pa}$ produces injury, because flow limitation in a collapsible tube guarantees the middle ear pressure cannot exceed the injury threshold within $T = 2\\,\\mathrm{s}$ regardless of the nasopharyngeal pressure.**\n  This statement is false because our calculation for $P_{\\mathrm{NP}} = 3000\\,\\mathrm{Pa}$ explicitly shows that the injury threshold is exceeded. The conclusion is contradicted by direct calculation.",
