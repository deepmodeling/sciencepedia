This exercise demonstrates how to rigorously evaluate a diagnostic tool, in this case nasal cytology, using fundamental principles of biostatistics. By calculating sensitivity, specificity, and predictive value from a hypothetical cohort, you will gain hands-on experience in assessing a test's intrinsic accuracy and understanding how its clinical usefulness changes with disease prevalence .",

            "problem": "A clinician is evaluating nasal cytology as a diagnostic test for Nonallergic Rhinitis with Eosinophilia Syndrome (NARES) within the non-allergic rhinitis spectrum, which also includes vasomotor rhinitis and rhinitis medicamentosa. The test considers a nasal smear positive if it shows more than $10$ eosinophils per high-power field. In a prospective cohort of $400$ adults with chronic rhinitis referred to an Ear, Nose, and Throat (ENT) clinic, all decongestants were withheld for $48$ hours to minimize acute pharmacologic effects of rhinitis medicamentosa on mucosal cells, and a reference standard based on clinical criteria plus blinded histopathology classified patients as follows:\n- True NARES: $160$ patients, of whom $136$ had positive nasal cytology and $24$ had negative nasal cytology.\n- Non-NARES: $240$ patients, of whom $48$ had positive nasal cytology and $192$ had negative nasal cytology.\n\nStarting from the formal definitions of sensitivity and specificity, compute the sensitivity and specificity of nasal cytology for diagnosing NARES from these data. Then, using Bayes’ theorem as the fundamental base, derive the positive predictive value as a function of disease prevalence $p$ and evaluate it for a primary care setting where the prevalence of NARES among patients presenting with chronic rhinitis is $p=0.30$. Round your final numeric result to four significant figures and express it as a decimal fraction (no percentage sign).",

Assume the following foundational, well-tested dynamics:\n\n- The drug effect compartment follows $ \\frac{dD}{dt} = -k_{d} D + u(t) $, where $k_{d} = \\ln(2)/t_{1/2,d}$ and $t_{1/2,d}$ is the effect-compartment half-life.\n- The receptor desensitization follows $ \\frac{dR}{dt} = -k_{r} R + g D $, where $k_{r} = \\ln(2)/t_{1/2,r}$ and $t_{1/2,r}$ is the desensitization recovery half-life.
