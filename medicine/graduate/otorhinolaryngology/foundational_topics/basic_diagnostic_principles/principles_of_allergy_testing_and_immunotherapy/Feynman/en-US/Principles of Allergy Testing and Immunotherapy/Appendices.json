            "introduction": "Many diagnostic tests, like the skin prick test (SPT), yield a continuous result such as wheal diameter. To translate this into a \"positive\" or \"negative\" decision, a specific threshold must be chosen, a choice that involves a crucial trade-off. This exercise allows you to directly manipulate raw patient data to see how adjusting a diagnostic cutoff alters the fundamental performance metrics of sensitivity and specificity, providing a concrete understanding of the Youden index as a tool for optimizing this balance .",

The SPT wheal diameter is recorded as the mean of the longest and orthogonal diameters, corrected by subtracting the negative control. A test is called positive if the corrected SPT wheal diameter is greater than or equal to a chosen threshold. The cohort comprises $240$ patients, of whom $120$ are NAPT-positive and $120$ are NAPT-negative. The distribution of corrected SPT wheal diameters, grouped by integer millimeters, is given below (counts within each NAPT stratum sum to $120$):\n\n- Among NAPT-positive patients: $6$ have $0$ mm, $6$ have $1$ mm, $8$ have $2$ mm, $12$ have $3$ mm, $14$ have $4$ mm, $18$ have $5$ mm, $20$ have $6$ mm, $18$ have $7$ mm, and $18$ have $\\geq 8$ mm.\n- Among NAPT-negative patients: $36$ have $0$ mm, $24$ have $1$ mm, $20$ have $2$ mm, $14$ have $3$ mm, $10$ have $4$ mm, $6$ have $5$ mm, $4$ have $6$ mm, $3$ have $7$ mm, and $3$ have $\\geq 8$ mm.\n\nUsing the foundational definitions of sensitivity, specificity, and the Youden index, first conceptualize how changing the SPT positivity threshold from $3$ mm to $5$ mm affects classification. Then, compute the following quantities:\n\n- The change in sensitivity, defined as sensitivity at $5$ mm minus sensitivity at $3$ mm.\n- The change in specificity, defined as specificity at $5$ mm minus specificity at $3$ mm.\n- The new Youden index at the $5$ mm threshold.\n\nExpress sensitivities, specificities, and the Youden index as decimals, not fractions, and express changes as differences of decimals.

            "solution": "The problem statement has been validated and is determined to be self-contained, scientifically grounded in the principles of diagnostic test evaluation, and internally consistent. All necessary data and definitions are provided to compute a unique and meaningful solution.\n\nThe problem requires the calculation of changes in sensitivity and specificity, and a new Youden index, resulting from an increase in the diagnostic threshold of a skin prick test (SPT). We begin by formally defining the relevant metrics. Let $D+$ represent the state of having a clinically relevant sensitization (NAPT-positive), and $D-$ represent its absence (NAPT-negative). The cohort consists of $N_P = 120$ patients in the $D+$ group and $N_N = 120$ patients in the $D-$ group. The SPT is considered positive ($T+$) if the corrected wheal diameter, $d$, is greater than or equal to a specified threshold, and negative ($T-$) otherwise.\n\nThe primary metrics of diagnostic accuracy are defined as:\n- Sensitivity ($Se$): The probability of a positive test result in a diseased individual. $Se = P(T+|D+) = \\frac{\\text{Number of True Positives (TP)}}{\\text{Total number of D+ patients}}$.\n- Specificity ($Sp$): The probability of a negative test result in a non-diseased individual. $Sp = P(T-|D-) = \\frac{\\text{Number of True Negatives (TN)}}{\\text{Total number of D- patients}}$.\n- Youden's Index ($J$): A summary measure of diagnostic effectiveness, defined as $J = Se + Sp - 1$.\n\nConceptually, raising the threshold for a positive test from $3$ mm to $5$ mm makes the test criterion more stringent. This will cause fewer patients to be classified as test-positive. Consequently, the number of true positives ($TP$) will decrease, leading to lower sensitivity. In parallel, the number of false positives ($FP$) will also decrease. Since the number of true negatives is given by $TN = N_N - FP$, a reduction in $FP$ leads to an increase in $TN$, thereby increasing specificity.\n\nWe will now calculate these quantities for the two thresholds.\n\n**1. Calculations for Threshold $d_1 = 3$ mm**\nA test is positive if $d \\geq 3$ mm.\n- The number of true positives, $TP_3$, is the sum of NAPT-positive patients with wheal diameters of $3$ mm or more:\n$$TP_3 = 12 + 14 + 18 + 20 + 18 + 18 = 100$$\nThe sensitivity at this threshold, $Se_3$, is:\n$$Se_3 = \\frac{TP_3}{N_P} = \\frac{100}{120} = \\frac{5}{6}$$\n- The number of true negatives, $TN_3$, is the sum of NAPT-negative patients with wheal diameters less than $3$ mm:\n$$TN_3 = 36 + 24 + 20 = 80$$\nThe specificity at this threshold, $Sp_3$, is:\n$$Sp_3 = \\frac{TN_3}{N_N} = \\frac{80}{120} = \\frac{2}{3}$$\n\n**2.
