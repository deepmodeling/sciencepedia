A complete solution will be provided.\n\nThe fundamental relationship provided is the linear pressure–flow model, analogous to Ohm's law for electrical circuits:\n$$\n\\Delta P = R\\,Q\n$$\nwhere $\\Delta P$ corresponds to voltage, $Q$ to current, and $R$ to resistance. From this relationship, the resistance $R$ can be calculated as the ratio of the pressure difference to the flow rate:\n$$\nR = \\frac{\\Delta P}{Q}\n$$\nThe problem provides data from active anterior rhinomanometry, where the flow through each nasal passage is measured independently at a reference pressure $\\Delta P_{\\mathrm{ref}} = 150\\,\\mathrm{Pa}$. We can use this information to calculate the individual resistances of the left ($R_L$) and right ($R_R$) nasal passages.\n\nFor the left passage:\n$$\nR_L = \\frac{\\Delta P_{\\mathrm{ref}}}{Q_{L}^{(\\mathrm{uni})}}\n$$\nFor the right passage:\n$$\nR_R = \\frac{\\Delta P_{\\mathrm{ref}}}{Q_{R}^{(\\mathrm{uni})}}\n$$\nThe problem states that when both passages are open (bilateral breathing), they function as independent parallel flow paths. For parallel paths, the total fluid flow is the sum of the individual flows, based on the principle of conservation of mass. If $Q_T$ is the total flow rate, then for a given shared pressure difference $\\Delta P$:\n$$\nQ_T = Q_L + Q_R\n$$\nThe total nasal resistance, $R_T$, is defined by the relationship for the entire system:\n$$\n\\Delta P = R_T Q_T \\implies Q_T = \\frac{\\Delta P}{R_T}\n$$\nSubstituting the expressions for the flows ($Q_T = \\frac{\\Delta P}{R_T}$, $Q_L = \\frac{\\Delta P}{R_L}$, $Q_R = \\frac{\\Delta P}{R_R}$) into the conservation of mass equation gives:\n$$\n\\frac{\\Delta P}{R_T} = \\frac{\\Delta P}{R_L} + \\frac{\\Delta P}{R_R}\n$$\nSince the pressure difference $\\Delta P$ is non-zero and common to all terms, we can divide by it, yielding the standard formula for combining resistances in parallel:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{R_T} = \\frac{1}{R_L} + \\frac{1}{R_R}\n$$\nThe first part of the task is to express $R_T$ in terms of the given experimental quantities: $\\Delta P_{\\mathrm{ref}}$, $Q_{L}^{(\\mathrm{uni})}$, and $Q_{R}^{(\\mathrm{uni})}$. We substitute the expressions for $R_L$ and $R_R$ into the parallel resistance formula:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{R_T} = \\frac{1}{\\frac{\\Delta P_{\\mathrm{ref}}}{Q_{L}^{(\\mathrm{uni})}}} + \\frac{1}{\\frac{\\Delta P_{\\mathrm{ref}}}{Q_{R}^{(\\mathrm{uni})}}}\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{1}{R_T} = \\frac{Q_{L}^{(\\mathrm{uni})}}{\\Delta P_{\\mathrm{ref}}} + \\frac{Q_{R}^{(\\mathrm{uni})}}{\\Delta P_{\\mathrm{ref}}} = \\frac{Q_{L}^{(\\mathrm{uni})} + Q_{R}^{(\\mathrm{uni})}}{\\Delta P_{\\mathrm{ref}}}\n$$\nInverting this expression gives the total resistance $R_T$ in terms of the given quantities, which completes the first part of the task:\n$$\nR_T = \\frac{\\Delta P_{\\mathrm{ref}}}{Q_{L}^{(\\mathrm{uni})} + Q_{R}^{(\\mathrm{uni})}}\n$$\nThis expression shows that the total resistance is the reference pressure divided by the simple sum of the unilateral flows measured at that pressure.\n\nThe second part of the task is to compute the numerical value of $R_T$. The given values are:\n- $\\Delta P_{\\mathrm{ref}} = 150\\,\\mathrm{Pa}$\n- $Q_{L}^{(\\mathrm{uni})} = 210\\,\\mathrm{mL/s}$\n- $Q_{R}^{(\\mathrm{uni})} = 90\\,\\mathrm{mL/s}$\n\nThe required unit for resistance is $\\mathrm{Pa\\cdot s/cm^{3}}$. We must ensure the units of flow are consistent. Since $1\\,\\mathrm{mL} = 1\\,\\mathrm{cm^{3}}$, the flow rates are already in the correct volumetric unit:\n- $Q_{L}^{(\\mathrm{uni})} = 210\\,\\mathrm{cm^3/s}$\n- $Q_{R}^{(\\mathrm{uni})} = 90\\,\\mathrm{cm^3/s}$\n\nFirst, we calculate the sum of the unilateral flows:\n$$\nQ_{L}^{(\\mathrm{uni})} + Q_{R}^{(\\mathrm{uni})} = 210\\,\\mathrm{cm^3/s} + 90\\,\\mathrm{cm^3/s} = 300\\,\\mathrm{cm^3/s}\n$$\nNow, we substitute the values into the derived expression for $R_T$:\n$$\nR_T = \\frac{150\\,\\mathrm{Pa}}{300\\,\\mathrm{cm^3/s}} = 0.5\\,\\mathrm{Pa\\cdot s/cm^3}\n$$\nThe problem requires the result to be rounded to three significant figures.\n$$\nR_T = 0.500\\,\\mathrm{Pa\\cdot s/cm^3}\n$$",
