            "problem": "A clinician investigates mucociliary clearance within the maxillary sinus in an adult subject under steady physiological conditions. In the standard two-layer mucus model of the respiratory epithelium, the overlying gel layer is transported tangentially by coordinated ciliary beating over a nearly stationary periciliary sol layer. Consider a micron-scale tracer particle embedded within the gel layer such that inertial effects are negligible and the particle motion is dominated by viscous coupling to the mucus. Under these conditions, assume that the particle is advected with the local mucus velocity along the epithelial surface.\n\nLet the transport occur along a smooth epithelial streamline parameterized by arc length coordinate $s$ with total path length $L$. The kinematic definition of speed is $v=ds/dt$. During the observation, the transport speed is experimentally found to be spatially uniform along the streamline and temporally steady with magnitude $v$. The particle starts at $s=0$ at time $t=0$ and exits at $s=L$ when $t=T$.\n\nUsing only the kinematic definition and the stated assumptions, derive the time-of-flight $T$ as a function of $L$ and $v$, then evaluate it for a maxillary sinus path length $L=3\\,\\mathrm{cm}$ and a ciliary transport speed $v=3\\,\\mathrm{mm/min}$. Express your final numerical answer in minutes and round to three significant figures.",
            "solution": "The problem requires the derivation of the time-of-flight, $T$, for a particle transported by mucociliary clearance over a distance $L$ at a constant speed $v$, followed by a numerical calculation. The derivation will begin from the fundamental kinematic definition of speed.\n\nThe relationship between speed $v$, position (arc length $s$), and time $t$ is given by the differential equation:\n$$v = \\frac{ds}{dt}$$\nThe problem states that the transport speed $v$ is both spatially uniform and temporally steady. This is a critical simplification, as it means $v$ can be treated as a constant throughout the particle's journey.\n\nTo determine the total time of flight $T$, we must solve this first-order ordinary differential equation. We can accomplish this by separating the variables $s$ and $t$:\n$$ds = v \\, dt$$\nNext, we integrate both sides of this equation over the defined path of the particle. The particle's motion begins at the initial condition $(s_0, t_0) = (0, 0)$ and ends at the final condition $(s_f, t_f) = (L, T)$. The corresponding definite integrals are:\n$$\\int_{s_0}^{s_f} ds = \\int_{t_0}^{t_f} v \\, dt$$\nSubstituting the given limits:\n$$\\int_{0}^{L} ds = \\int_{0}^{T} v \\, dt$$\nSince $v$ is a constant, it can be factored out of the integral on the right-hand side:\n$$\\int_{0}^{L} 1 \\cdot ds = v \\int_{0}^{T} 1 \\cdot dt$$\nEvaluating these elementary integrals gives:\n$$[s]_{0}^{L} = v [t]_{0}^{T}$$\nApplying the fundamental theorem of calculus by substituting the limits of integration, we obtain:\n$$L - 0 = v(T - 0)$$\nThis simplifies to the well-known algebraic relationship for motion at constant speed:\n$$L = vT$$\nSolving for the time-of-flight $T$ provides the derived expression as a function of $L$ and $v$:\n$$T = \\frac{L}{v}$$\nThis concludes the derivation portion of the problem.\n\nFor the second part of the task, we must evaluate $T$ using the provided numerical values: path length $L = 3\\,\\mathrm{cm}$ and transport speed $v = 3\\,\\mathrm{mm/min}$. It is essential to ensure that the units are consistent before performing the calculation. We will convert the path length $L$ from centimeters ($cm$) to millimeters ($mm$) to match the units of the speed $v$.\nThe conversion is as follows:\n$$L = 3\\,\\mathrm{cm} \\times \\frac{10\\,\\mathrm{mm}}{1\\,\\mathrm{cm}} = 30\\,\\mathrm{mm}$$\nNow, with $L = 30\\,\\mathrm{mm}$ and $v = 3\\,\\mathrm{mm/min}$, we can substitute these values into our derived formula for $T$:\n$$T = \\frac{30\\,\\mathrm{mm}}{3\\,\\mathrm{mm/min}}$$\nThe calculation results in:\n$$T = 10\\,\\mathrm{min}$$\nThe final instruction is to express the numerical answer in minutes, rounded to three significant figures.

            "problem": "A patient with chronic nasal inflammation undergoes isotonic saline irrigation. In the nasal epithelial mucociliary system, assume the following scientifically supported framework: the mucus layer is transported over the periciliary liquid layer under steady conditions where inertial effects are negligible. Under these conditions, treat the transport as creeping flow characterized by a low Reynolds number ($Re \\ll 1$) so that the dominant resisting stress is viscous. Cilia generate a time-averaged propulsive force $F_{c}$ that remains constant over the short timescale of the intervention, and the net transport speed $v$ is set by a balance between this propulsive force and viscous resistance.\n\nUsing this framework and fundamental definitions of viscosity and viscous drag in laminar shear, reason from first principles to establish the scaling of $v$ with the dynamic viscosity $\\mu$ of the mucus at the operating shear rate.

            "solution": "The problem requires a derivation of the post-irrigation mucociliary transport speed based on fundamental principles of fluid dynamics under creeping flow conditions.\n\n**Step 1: Establish the scaling relationship between transport speed and viscosity.**\n\nThe problem statement specifies that the transport occurs under steady conditions where inertial effects are negligible. This corresponds to the regime of creeping flow, also known as Stokes flow, characterized by a very low Reynolds number ($Re \\ll 1$). In this regime, the dominant resisting force is viscous drag.\n\nThe net transport speed, $v$, is established by a balance between the propulsive force generated by the cilia, $F_c$, and the viscous drag force, $F_d$. At steady state, these forces are equal:\n$$F_c = F_d$$\nFor creeping flow, the governing Stokes equations are linear in velocity and pressure. A fundamental consequence of this linearity is that the drag force on an object moving through the fluid, or the drag exerted by a fluid moving over a surface, is directly proportional to both the dynamic viscosity of the fluid, $\\mu$, and a characteristic velocity, $v$. This relationship can be expressed generally as:\n$$F_d = C \\mu v$$\nThe coefficient $C$ is a geometric factor that depends on the shape and size of the flow domain but is independent of the fluid properties ($\\mu$) or the flow speed ($v$). In this problem, the geometry of the nasal epithelium and the mucus layer is assumed to be constant. Thus, $C$ is a constant.\n\nBy substituting the expression for $F_d$ into the force balance equation, we obtain:\n$$F_c = C \\mu v$$\nThe problem states that the propulsive force $F_c$ also remains constant during the short-term intervention. We can rearrange the equation to express the transport speed $v$ in terms of the other parameters:\n$$v = \\frac{F_c}{C \\mu}$$\nSince both $F_c$ and $C$ are constants, we can deduce the scaling relationship between speed and viscosity:\n$$v \\propto \\frac{1}{\\mu}$$\nThis shows that the mucociliary transport speed is inversely proportional to the dynamic viscosity of the mucus.\n\n**Step 2: Apply the scaling relationship to the given conditions.**\n\nLet the baseline (pre-irrigation) state be denoted by the subscript $0$ and the post-irrigation state by the subscript $1$. We can write the speeds for the two states as:\n$$v_0 = \\frac{F_c}{C \\mu_0}$$\n$$v_1 = \\frac{F_c}{C \\mu_1}$$\nTo find the post-irrigation speed $v_1$, we can take the ratio of the two expressions to eliminate the unknown constants $F_c$ and $C$:\n$$\\frac{v_1}{v_0} = \\frac{\\frac{F_c}{C \\mu_1}}{\\frac{F_c}{C \\mu_0}} = \\frac{\\mu_0}{\\mu_1}$$\nRearranging for $v_1$ yields:\n$$v_1 = v_0 \\left(\\frac{\\mu_0}{\\mu_1}\\right)$$\nWe are given the baseline transport speed $v_0 = 8.00 \\, \\text{mm/min}$. We are also told that the saline irrigation reduces the dynamic viscosity by $30\\%$. This means the new viscosity, $\\mu_1$, is $30\\%$ lower than the baseline viscosity, $\\mu_0$. We can express this reduction mathematically:\n$$\\mu_1 = \\mu_0 - 0.30 \\mu_0 = (1 - 0.30) \\mu_0 = 0.70 \\mu_0$$\nNow, we substitute this relationship into the equation for $v_1$:\n$$v_1 = v_0 \\left(\\frac{\\mu_0}{0.70 \\mu_0}\\right)$$\nThe baseline viscosity $\\mu_0$ cancels out, simplifying the expression to:\n$$v_1 = \\frac{v_0}{0.70}$$\n\n**Step 3: Compute the numerical value of the post-irrigation speed.**\n\nUsing the given value for $v_0$, we can calculate $v_1$:\n$$v_1 = \\frac{8.00}{0.70} \\, \\text{mm/min}$$\nPerforming the calculation:\n$$v_1 = \\frac{8}{0.7} \\, \\text{mm/min} = \\frac{80}{7} \\, \\text{mm/min} \\approx 11.428571... \\, \\text{mm/min}$$\nThe problem asks for the final answer to be rounded to four significant figures.
