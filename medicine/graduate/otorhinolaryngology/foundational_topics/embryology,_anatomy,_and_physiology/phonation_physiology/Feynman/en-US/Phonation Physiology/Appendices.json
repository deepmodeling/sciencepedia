            "solution": "The problem presents a task in two parts: first, to derive the expression for aerodynamic power in the context of the myoelastic-aerodynamic theory of phonation under specific approximations; and second, to apply this expression to calculate the change in Sound Pressure Level (SPL) between two phonatory conditions.\n\nFirst, we address the derivation of aerodynamic power, denoted as $P_{aero}$. The problem asks us to start from the definition that mechanical power is the time rate of work done by pressure forces on a control surface. Work ($W$) is defined as the product of force ($F$) and displacement ($s$), and power ($P$) is the time derivative of work, $P = \\frac{dW}{dt}$.\n\nIn a fluid system, the force exerted by a pressure $p$ on a surface of area $A$ is $F = pA$. For an infinitesimal displacement $ds$ of the fluid, the work done is $dW = F ds = (pA)ds$. The term $A \\cdot ds$ represents an infinitesimal volume of fluid, $dV$. Therefore, the work done can be expressed as $dW = p \\, dV$.\n\nPower is the rate at which this work is performed:\n$$ P = \\frac{dW}{dt} = \\frac{d}{dt}(p \\, dV) $$\nAssuming the pressure $p$ is constant over the timescale of the volume change, we have:\n$$ P = p \\frac{dV}{dt} $$\nThe term $\\frac{dV}{dt}$ is, by definition, the volumetric flow rate of the fluid, which is denoted in the problem by $U$. Thus, the mechanical power associated with a fluid flow is given by the product of pressure and volumetric flow rate:\n$$ P = pU $$\nThe problem specifies that for the laryngeal system, the energy is supplied by the lungs in the form of subglottal pressure, $P_s$. We are instructed to consider the work done by this pressure over the glottal inlet and to neglect the contribution of supraglottal pressure. Under these approximations, the total aerodynamic power supplied to the glottis is the work done by the subglottal pressure to drive the airflow. For a sustained phonatory task under quasi-steady conditions, we consider the mean subglottal pressure and mean volumetric airflow. Therefore, the mean aerodynamic power delivered to the vocal folds is:\n$$ P_{aero} = P_s U $$\nwhere $P_s$ and $U$ represent the mean values of subglottal pressure and volumetric airflow, respectively. This completes the first part of the problem.\n\nNext, we calculate the predicted change in Sound Pressure Level ($\\Delta \\text{SPL}$) between Condition A and Condition B. The given data are:\n- Condition A: $P_{s,A} = 7.5 \\text{ cm H}_2\\text{O}$ and $U_A = 0.10 \\text{ L/s}$.\n- Condition B: $P_{s,B} = 12.0 \\text{ cm H}_2\\text{O}$ and $U_B = 0.14 \\text{ L/s}$.\n\nThe problem states that the radiated acoustic power, $P_{ac}$, scales proportionally with the aerodynamic power, $P_{aero}$. We can write this relationship as $P_{ac} = \\eta P_{aero}$, where $\\eta$ is a constant of proportionality representing the glottal efficiency. It is assumed that $\\eta$ is the same for both conditions.\n\nThe change in SPL, measured in decibels (dB), is defined by the base-10 logarithm of the ratio of the acoustic powers:\n$$ \\Delta \\text{SPL} = \\text{SPL}_B - \\text{SPL}_A = 10 \\log_{10}\\left(\\frac{P_{ac,B}}{P_{ac,A}}\\right) $$\nSubstituting the proportionality for acoustic power, we get:\n$$ \\Delta \\text{SPL} = 10 \\log_{10}\\left(\\frac{\\eta P_{aero,B}}{\\eta P_{aero,A}}\\right) = 10 \\log_{10}\\left(\\frac{P_{aero,B}}{P_{aero,A}}\\right) $$\nNow, we use our derived expression for aerodynamic power, $P_{aero} = P_s U$:\n$$ \\Delta \\text{SPL} = 10 \\log_{10}\\left(\\frac{P_{s,B} U_B}{P_{s,A} U_A}\\right) $$\nWe can now substitute the numerical values. Note that since we are calculating a ratio, the specific units of pressure and flow do not matter as long as they are consistent between the two conditions. The conversion factors from cm H$_2$O to Pascals and from L/s to m$^3$/s would appear in both the numerator and the denominator, and thus cancel out.\n\nLet's compute the ratio of the products:\n$$ \\frac{P_{s,B} U_B}{P_{s,A} U_A} = \\frac{(12.0)(0.14)}{(7.5)(0.10)} = \\frac{1.68}{0.75} = 2.24 $$\nNow, we can calculate the change in SPL:\n$$ \\Delta \\text{SPL} = 10 \\log_{10}(2.24) $$\nUsing a calculator for the logarithm:\n$$ \\Delta \\text{SPL} \\approx 10 \\times 0.3502478 \\approx 3.502478 \\text{ dB} $$\nThe problem requires the final answer to be rounded to four significant figures.\n$$ \\Delta \\text{SPL} \\approx 3.502 \\text{ dB} $$\nThis value represents the predicted increase in sound pressure level from Condition A to Condition B based on the changes in aerodynamic parameters.",

Second, the calculation of a numerical value for this inertance. Third, a qualitative analysis of the effect of this inertance on a simplified model of vocal fold vibration.\n\nPart 1: Derivation of the Inertive Coefficient\n\nWe begin by applying Newton's second law, $F = ma$, to the column of air contained within the straw. The straw has a length $L$ and a constant cross-sectional area $A$. The air inside has a density $\\rho$.\n\nThe mass, $m$, of the air column is the product of its density and volume, where the volume is $A \\cdot L$:\n$$m = \\rho A L$$\n\nA trans-straw pressure difference, $\\Delta p(t)$, is applied across the ends of the straw. This pressure difference creates a net force, $F(t)$, on the air column, acting over the cross-sectional area $A$:\n$$F(t) = \\Delta p(t) \\cdot A$$\n\nThe acceleration, $a(t)$, of the air column is the time derivative of its spatially averaged axial velocity, $v(t)$:\n$$a(t) = \\frac{dv(t)}{dt}$$\n\nSubstituting these expressions for force, mass, and acceleration into Newton's second law gives:\n$$\\Delta p(t) \\cdot A = (\\rho A L) \\frac{dv(t)}{dt}$$\n\nThe problem asks for a relationship involving the volume velocity, $U(t)$. The volume velocity is defined as the product of the cross-sectional area and the particle velocity: $U(t) = A v(t)$. We can express $v(t)$ in terms of $U(t)$:\n$$v(t) = \\frac{U(t)}{A}$$\nSince the area $A$ is constant, the acceleration can be written in terms of the time derivative of the volume velocity:\n$$\\frac{dv(t)}{dt} = \\frac{d}{dt}\\left(\\frac{U(t)}{A}\\right) = \\frac{1}{A} \\frac{dU(t)}{dt}$$\n\nNow, we substitute this expression for $\\frac{dv(t)}{dt}$ back into the equation of motion:\n$$\\Delta p(t) \\cdot A = (\\rho A L) \\left(\\frac{1}{A} \\frac{dU(t)}{dt}\\right)$$\nThe term $A$ on the right side of the equation cancels out:\n$$\\Delta p(t) \\cdot A = \\rho L \\frac{dU(t)}{dt}$$\nSolving for the pressure difference, $\\Delta p(t)$, we obtain:\n$$\\Delta p(t) = \\frac{\\rho L}{A} \\frac{dU(t)}{dt}$$\nThis equation shows that the pressure difference required to accelerate the air column is proportional to the rate of change of the volume velocity, $\\frac{dU(t)}{dt}$. This is the definition of an acoustic inertance. The general relationship is $\\Delta p(t) = I \\frac{dU(t)}{dt}$, where $I$ is the inertive coefficient, or acoustic inertance.\n\nBy comparing the derived equation with the general form, we identify the inertive coefficient for the straw as:\n$$I = \\frac{\\rho L}{A}$$\n\nPart 2: Numerical Calculation of Inertance\n\nWe are given the following values:\nLength of the straw, $L = 0.17$ m.\nCross-sectional area of the straw, $A = 8.0 \\times 10^{-6}$ m$^{2}$.\nDensity of air, $\\rho = 1.18$ kg m$^{-3}$.\n\nSubstituting these values into the expression for inertance $I$:\n$$I = \\frac{(1.18 \\, \\text{kg m}^{-3}) (0.17 \\, \\text{m})}{8.0 \\times 10^{-6} \\, \\text{m}^{2}}$$\n$$I = \\frac{0.2006 \\, \\text{kg m}^{-2}}{8.0 \\times 10^{-6} \\, \\text{m}^{2}} = 25075 \\, \\text{kg m}^{-4}$$\nThe units of kg m$^{-4}$ are equivalent to Pa s$^{2}$ m$^{-3}$, as shown by dimensional analysis:\n$$\\text{Pa} \\cdot \\text{s}^2 \\cdot \\text{m}^{-3} = \\left(\\frac{\\text{N}}{\\text{m}^2}\\right) \\cdot \\text{s}^2 \\cdot \\text{m}^{-3} = \\left(\\frac{\\text{kg} \\cdot \\text{m}}{\\text{s}^2 \\cdot \\text{m}^2}\\right) \\cdot \\text{s}^2 \\cdot \\text{m}^{-3} = \\left(\\frac{\\text{kg}}{\\text{m} \\cdot \\text{s}^2}\\right) \\cdot \\text{s}^2 \\cdot \\text{m}^{-3} = \\frac{\\text{kg}}{\\text{m}^4}$$\nThe problem requires the result to be rounded to four significant figures. Rounding $25075$ to four significant figures gives $25080$. In scientific notation, this is $2.508 \\times 10^{4}$.\nSo, the computed inertance is $I = 25080$ Pa s$^{2}$ m$^{-3}$.\n\nPart 3: Qualitative Argument on Vocal Fold Dynamics\n\nWe start with the linearized one-mass model of the vocal folds:\n$$m\\,\\ddot{x}(t) + b\\,\\dot{x}(t) + k\\,x(t) = S\\left(p_{\\text{sub}} - p_{\\text{sup}}(t)\\right)$$\nHere, $p_{\\text{sup}}(t)$ is the supraglottal pressure, which acts as the acoustic load on the vocal folds. For the idealized straw, this pressure is the pressure at the entrance of the straw, assuming the exit is at atmospheric pressure (zero gauge pressure). The trans-straw pressure difference is then $\\Delta p(t) = p_{\\text{sup}}(t) - 0 = p_{\\text{sup}}(t)$.\n\nFrom Part 1, we established that for an inertive load, this pressure is related to the rate of change of volume velocity:\n$$p_{\\text{sup}}(t) = I \\frac{dU(t)}{dt}$$\nThe problem provides a linear coupling assumption between the glottal volume velocity $U(t)$ and the vocal fold displacement $x(t)$: $U(t) \\approx \\gamma\\,x(t)$, where $\\gamma$ is a positive constant. Differentiating this with respect to time yields:\n$$\\frac{dU(t)}{dt} \\approx \\gamma\\,\\frac{dx(t)}{dt} = \\gamma\\,\\dot{x}(t)$$\nSubstituting this into the expression for $p_{\\text{sup}}(t)$:\n$$p_{\\text{sup}}(t) \\approx I \\gamma \\dot{x}(t)$$\nNow, we substitute this expression for the supraglottal pressure back into the original one-mass model equation:\n$$m\\,\\ddot{x}(t) + b\\,\\dot{x}(t) + k\\,x(t) = S\\left(p_{\\text{sub}} - I \\gamma \\dot{x}(t)\\right)$$\nLet's expand the right-hand side and rearrange the equation to group all terms related to the oscillator's dynamics on the left-hand side:\n$$m\\,\\ddot{x}(t) + b\\,\\dot{x}(t) + k\\,x(t) = S p_{\\text{sub}} - S I \\gamma \\dot{x}(t)$$\n$$m\\,\\ddot{x}(t) + b\\,\\dot{x}(t) + S I \\gamma \\dot{x}(t) + k\\,x(t) = S p_{\\text{sub}}$$\nCombining the terms proportional to the velocity $\\dot{x}(t)$:\n$$m\\,\\ddot{x}(t) + (b + S I \\gamma)\\dot{x}(t) + k\\,x(t) = S p_{\\text{sub}}$$\nThis modified equation has the form of a damped harmonic oscillator with an effective damping coefficient $b_{\\text{eff}}$:\n$$b_{\\text{eff}} = b + S I \\gamma$$\nSince the effective projected area $S$, the inertance $I$, and the coupling constant $\\gamma$ are all positive physical quantities, the term $S I \\gamma$ is strictly positive. Therefore, the inertive supraglottal load has the effect of increasing the total damping of the vocal fold system, i.e., $b_{\\text{eff}} > b$.\n\nEffect on Vocal Fold Closing Speed: Damping is a force that opposes motion. A higher effective damping coefficient means a larger force opposing the velocity of the vocal folds. During the closing phase of the glottal cycle, the vocal folds move toward the midline. The increased damping force opposes this motion, causing the vocal folds to decelerate more strongly. This results in a **slower vocal fold closing speed** and a less abrupt collision.\n\nEffect on High-Frequency Spectral Tilt: The glottal source spectrum is determined by the shape of the glottal volume velocity waveform, $U(t)$. The abruptness of the glottal closure is a primary factor influencing the high-frequency content of the source. A rapid, abrupt closure creates a sharp \"corner\" in the $U(t)$ waveform, which Fourier analysis shows corresponds to significant energy in the high-frequency harmonics, leading to a shallow spectral tilt (slow roll-off). Conversely, the slower, more gradual closure induced by the inertive load results in a smoother $U(t)$ waveform with less-defined corners. This smoother waveform contains less energy in the high-frequency harmonics, resulting in a **steeper high-frequency spectral tilt** (faster roll-off of harmonic amplitudes). This is perceived as a less \"pressed\" or \"breathy\" and more \"resonant\" or \"rounded\" voice quality.",
