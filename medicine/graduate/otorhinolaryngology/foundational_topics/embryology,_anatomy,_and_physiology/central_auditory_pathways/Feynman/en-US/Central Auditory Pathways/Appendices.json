This practice problem  provides a concrete, quantitative way to understand this \"frequency map\" in the brain. By calculating the physical distance along the auditory cortex that corresponds to a specific range of sound frequencies, you will bridge the gap between the abstract concept of frequency and the physical layout of neural tissue.",

            "problem": "In the central auditory pathways, the primary auditory cortex (A1) exhibits a tonotopic organization in which position along a cortical axis systematically corresponds to best frequency. Suppose microelectrode mapping along Heschl’s gyrus reveals a spatial gradient of $0.8$ millimeters per octave, meaning that a change of one octave in best frequency corresponds to a displacement of $0.8$ millimeters along the tonotopic axis. Using only the following fundamental definitions and well-tested facts, derive and compute the cortical distance between loci tuned to best frequencies of $500$ Hz and $4$ kHz along this axis: (i) an octave is defined as a doubling of frequency, and (ii) the number of octaves spanned by a frequency change from $f_{1}$ to $f_{2}$ equals the base-$2$ logarithm of the ratio $f_{2}/f_{1}$. Express your final distance in millimeters and round your answer to four significant figures.",
            "solution": "Tonotopic organization in the primary auditory cortex (A1) can be characterized by a spatial gradient that relates cortical displacement to changes in best frequency. The given gradient is $0.8$ millimeters per octave, which states that for each octave change in frequency there is a $0.8$ millimeter displacement along the tonotopic axis.\n\nWe are asked to determine the cortical distance between positions tuned to $f_{1} = 500$ Hz and $f_{2} = 4$ kHz. The fundamental definition of an octave is a doubling of frequency. Therefore, the number of octaves between two frequencies is given by the base-$2$ logarithm of their ratio:\n$$\nN = \\log_{2}\\!\\left(\\frac{f_{2}}{f_{1}}\\right).\n$$\nSubstituting $f_{1} = 500$ Hz and $f_{2} = 4$ kHz $= 4000$ Hz yields:\n$$\nN = \\log_{2}\\!\\left(\\frac{4000}{500}\\right) = \\log_{2}(8).\n$$\nRecognizing that $8 = 2^{3}$, it follows that\n$$\nN = 3 \\text{ octaves}.\n$$\nGiven the spatial gradient $g = 0.8$ millimeters per octave, the cortical distance $d$ corresponding to a change of $N$ octaves is\n$$\nd = g \\times N = 0.8 \\times 3 = 2.4 \\text{ millimeters}.\n$$\nTo comply with the instruction to round to four significant figures, we write\n$$\nd = 2.400 \\text{ millimeters}.\n$$\nThus, the cortical distance between loci tuned to $500$ Hz and $4$ kHz along the tonotopic axis is $2.400$ millimeters when rounded to four significant figures.",

            "introduction": "Localizing the source of a sound is a critical computational task performed by the brain, relying heavily on comparing the signals received by the two ears. This exercise explores the physical basis of the primary cue for low-frequency sound localization: the interaural time difference (ITD). By modeling the head as a simple sphere , you will determine the maximum possible time delay a sound can experience traveling from one ear to the other, thereby defining the precise operational range that the brain's specialized neural circuits must be built to handle.",

            "problem": "A sound source in the horizontal plane is at azimuth angle $\\theta$ relative to the listener’s midline (front is $\\theta=0$, rightward is $\\theta=\\frac{\\pi}{2}$). Assume the head can be modeled as a rigid sphere of radius $r$ with the two ear canals located at antipodal points on the equator of the sphere. A far-field source produces a plane wave at speed of sound $c$ in air. The interaural time difference (ITD) is defined as the difference in acoustic propagation times from the source to the two ear canals. Using first principles (plane-wave kinematics and geometric path length differences around an occluding rigid sphere), derive an expression for the ITD as a function of $\\theta$, determine the azimuth that maximizes the ITD, and compute the maximum physiological ITD for $r=9\\ \\mathrm{cm}$ and $c=343\\ \\mathrm{m/s}$. Then, adopting the standard central auditory coincidence-detection framework in the Medial Superior Olive (MSO), in which axonal delay lines implement internal delays to match external ITDs, infer the minimal neural delay range required to represent the full set of physiological ITDs in the horizontal plane. Express the final numerical value (the maximal ITD and hence the minimal required neural delay range) in milliseconds and round your answer to four significant figures.",
            "solution": "The interaural time difference (ITD) is defined as the difference in propagation times from the sound source to the two ears. For a far-field source producing a plane wave, propagation time equals path length divided by sound speed. Let the head be a rigid sphere of radius $r$ with ears at antipodal points on the equator. Consider the horizontal-plane azimuth $\\theta$ measured from the midline (front) toward the right.\n\nFundamental base:\n1. Plane-wave kinematics: For a wave traveling at speed $c$, time equals distance divided by speed, i.e., $t=\\frac{d}{c}$.\n2. Geometric occlusion by a rigid sphere: The farther ear lies in the acoustic shadow for $\\theta\\neq 0$, and the earliest-arriving wavefront at the far ear reaches it by wrapping around the sphere’s surface. The additional path length caused by occlusion can be accounted for via spherical geometry.\n\nWe construct the path-length difference between the far and near ears by decomposing it into two components:\n- A linear-projection component due to the relative positions of the ears with respect to the wave direction.\n- A diffraction wrap-around component due to the rigid spherical occlusion.\n\nFor a spherical head, the well-tested geometric result (Woodworth’s formula) for the path-length difference in the horizontal plane is\n$$\n\\Delta d(\\theta)=r\\big(\\theta+\\sin\\theta\\big),\n$$\nvalid for $0\\leq \\theta\\leq \\frac{\\pi}{2}$, where $\\theta$ is in radians. This expression can be reasoned from first principles as follows. The nearest ear sees the wavefront directly; for the far ear, the earliest wavefront that reaches it must traverse an extra arc along the sphere boundary of angular extent $\\theta$, adding an arc length $r\\theta$, and there is also a geometric projection difference between ears along the wave direction equal to $r\\sin\\theta$. Summing these yields $r(\\theta+\\sin\\theta)$.\n\nBy definition, the ITD is the path-length difference divided by the speed of sound:\n$$\n\\mathrm{ITD}(\\theta)=\\frac{\\Delta d(\\theta)}{c}=\\frac{r}{c}\\big(\\theta+\\sin\\theta\\big).\n$$\nTo find the maximum physiological ITD in the horizontal plane, we restrict $\\theta$ to $[0,\\frac{\\pi}{2}]$ (front to right), noting symmetry for leftward azimuths.

            "introduction": "While time differences are key for localizing low-frequency sounds, the brain uses a different cue for high-frequency sounds: differences in loudness, or interaural level differences (ILDs). This exercise  delves into the specific brainstem circuit in the Lateral Superior Olive (LSO) that computes ILDs. By reasoning through how an LSO neuron integrates an excitatory signal from the ipsilateral ear and an inhibitory signal from the contralateral ear, you can predict its firing behavior and understand a classic example of neural computation through the opposition of inputs.",

            "problem": "A single neuron in the Lateral Superior Olive (LSO) within the Superior Olivary Complex (SOC) receives excitatory input from the ipsilateral Anteroventral Cochlear Nucleus (AVCN) and inhibitory input from the contralateral AVCN via the glycinergic Medial Nucleus of the Trapezoid Body (MNTB). Assume standard physiological operating conditions: excitatory synapses from the ipsilateral ear and inhibitory synapses driven by the contralateral ear are coactive and converge with submillisecond timing, and LSO neurons encode Interaural Level Difference (ILD) by approximately integrating ipsilateral excitation and contralateral inhibition in a monotonic, saturating fashion. Consider that Sound Pressure Level (SPL) in decibels is defined by the fundamental relation $L_p = 20 \\log_{10}(p/p_0)$ where $p_0 = 20 \\ \\mu\\text{Pa}$, and acoustic intensity $I$ is proportional to $p^2$. Use these core definitions and the known circuit motif to reason about the direction of the LSO response.\n\nAn acoustic stimulus is delivered dichotically such that the ipsilateral ear receives $70 \\ \\text{dB SPL}$ and the contralateral ear receives $60 \\ \\text{dB SPL}$. Relative to an equal-level baseline (e.g., both ears at $65 \\ \\text{dB SPL}$) in which excitation and inhibition are balanced for this neuron, predict the sign of the change in the LSO neuron's output and the qualitative direction of its magnitude dependence with respect to the interaural level difference. Choose the best description.\n\nA. The LSO firing rate increases relative to the equal-level baseline, with a positive change that grows monotonically with the ipsilateral-minus-contralateral level difference (i.e., for a $+10 \\ \\text{dB}$ ILD favoring the ipsilateral ear), rather than with the binaural sum.\n\nB. The LSO firing rate decreases relative to the equal-level baseline because contralateral inhibition dominates over ipsilateral excitation at these levels, yielding a negative change that grows with the contralateral-minus-ipsilateral difference.\n\nC. There is no systematic change because the LSO primarily encodes interaural time differences and not level differences; output is therefore insensitive to a $10 \\ \\text{dB}$ interaural level difference.\n\nD. The LSO firing rate increases in proportion to the total binaural level (approximately $70 + 60 = 130 \\ \\text{dB}$), irrespective of which ear is more intense, because LSO acts as a binaural energy detector.\n\nE. The LSO output remains effectively unchanged because the logarithmic nature of the decibel scale causes the excitatory and inhibitory drives to cancel for any fixed difference of $10 \\ \\text{dB}$ across ears.",
            "solution": "The Lateral Superior Olive (LSO) circuit is a classic example of neural computation via subtraction. The problem states that an LSO neuron receives excitatory input from the ipsilateral ear and inhibitory input from the contralateral ear. Its firing rate reflects the balance between these two opposing drives.\n\n1.  **Inputs:** The ipsilateral ear receives a 70 dB SPL stimulus, driving excitation. The contralateral ear receives a 60 dB SPL stimulus, driving inhibition (via the MNTB inverter).\n2.  **Comparison:** The stimulus is stronger in the ipsilateral ear. This means the excitatory drive will be greater than the inhibitory drive, compared to a baseline where the levels are equal and the drives are balanced.\n3.  **Output:** Because excitation outweighs inhibition, the net effect on the LSO neuron is an increase in its firing rate relative to the balanced baseline.\n4.  **Encoding:** The magnitude of this firing rate change is dependent on the difference in levels, not their sum. The Interaural Level Difference (ILD) is $70 \\ \\text{dB} - 60 \\ \\text{dB} = +10 \\ \\text{dB}$ (favoring the ipsilateral ear). A larger positive ILD would lead to a greater increase in firing rate, up to a saturation point.\n\nTherefore, the neuron's firing rate increases in a manner that encodes the positive ILD.\n\n*   **Option A** correctly describes this mechanism: the firing rate increases, and this change is monotonically related to the ipsilateral-minus-contralateral level difference.\n*   **Option B** is incorrect because excitation, not inhibition, dominates.\n*   **Option C** is incorrect; the LSO is the primary site for ILD processing, while the Medial Superior Olive (MSO) processes ITDs.\n*   **Option D** is incorrect because the LSO performs a subtraction-like operation, not a summation of energy.\n*   **Option E** is incorrect because a 10 dB difference represents a tenfold difference in acoustic power, which results in a significant imbalance between the excitatory and inhibitory drives.",
