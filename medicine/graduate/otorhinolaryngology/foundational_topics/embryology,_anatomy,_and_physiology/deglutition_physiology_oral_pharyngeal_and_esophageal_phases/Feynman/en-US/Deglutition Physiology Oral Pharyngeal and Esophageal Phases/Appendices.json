A key challenge in deglutition is managing foods of varying consistency, where higher viscosity demands greater muscular effort.

It is a direct application of fundamental principles of fluid mechanics to a simplified, but relevant, biomechanical model. Therefore, the problem is valid.\n\nThe derivation begins with the conservation of momentum for a Newtonian fluid in steady, fully developed, axisymmetric, laminar flow through a circular channel. We will use a momentum balance on a cylindrical shell of fluid of radius $\\rho$ (where $0 \\le \\rho \\le r$) and length $L$.\n\nUnder the given assumptions, the axial velocity $u_z$ is a function of the radial coordinate $\\rho$ only, i.e., $u_z = u_z(\\rho)$. The flow is driven by a pressure gradient. For a steady flow, the net force on the cylindrical fluid element must be zero. The forces acting in the axial ($z$) direction are the pressure forces on the two faces and the shear force on the cylindrical surface.\n\nThe pressure force on the face at $z=0$ is $P(0) \\cdot \\pi \\rho^2$.\nThe pressure force on the face at $z=L$ is $-P(L) \\cdot \\pi \\rho^2$.\nThe shear force exerted by the outer fluid on the surface of the cylindrical element is $\\tau_{\\rho z} \\cdot 2 \\pi \\rho L$, where $\\tau_{\\rho z}$ is the shear stress. This force acts in the negative $z$-direction, opposing the flow.\n\nThe force balance in the $z$-direction is:\n$$ (P(0) - P(L)) \\pi \\rho^2 + \\tau_{\\rho z} (2 \\pi \\rho L) = 0 $$\nLet the pressure drop be $\\Delta P = P(0) - P(L)$. The equation becomes:\n$$ \\Delta P \\pi \\rho^2 = - \\tau_{\\rho z} (2 \\pi \\rho L) $$\nSolving for the shear stress $\\tau_{\\rho z}$ as a function of radial position $\\rho$:\n$$ \\tau_{\\rho z} = -\\frac{\\Delta P}{2L} \\rho $$\nThe problem provides the constitutive relation for a Newtonian fluid, $\\tau = \\mu \\frac{du}{dr}$. In our coordinate system, this is $\\tau_{\\rho z} = \\mu \\frac{du_z}{d\\rho}$. Substituting this into the force balance result:\n$$ \\mu \\frac{du_z}{d\\rho} = -\\frac{\\Delta P}{2L} \\rho $$\nWe can separate variables and integrate to find the velocity profile $u_z(\\rho)$:\n$$ du_z = -\\frac{\\Delta P}{2 \\mu L} \\rho \\, d\\rho $$\n$$ \\int du_z = \\int -\\frac{\\Delta P}{2 \\mu L} \\rho \\, d\\rho $$\n$$ u_z(\\rho) = -\\frac{\\Delta P}{4 \\mu L} \\rho^2 + C_1 $$\nwhere $C_1$ is the constant of integration. We determine $C_1$ by applying the no-slip boundary condition at the channel wall, which states that the fluid velocity is zero at $\\rho = r$:\n$$ u_z(r) = 0 \\implies 0 = -\\frac{\\Delta P}{4 \\mu L} r^2 + C_1 $$\n$$ C_1 = \\frac{\\Delta P}{4 \\mu L} r^2 $$\nSubstituting $C_1$ back into the velocity equation gives the parabolic velocity profile:\n$$ u_z(\\rho) = \\frac{\\Delta P}{4 \\mu L} (r^2 - \\rho^2) $$\nThe volumetric flow rate $Q$ is obtained by integrating the velocity profile over the cross-sectional area of the channel.

Project the excursion vector onto the given muscle line-of-action.\n4.  Apply the linear model to determine the final UES opening diameter.\n\nFirst, we define the hyoid excursion vector, $\\vec{H}$, in a Cartesian coordinate system where the positive $x$-axis represents the anterior direction and the positive $y$-axis represents the superior direction. The components of the vector are given by the provided excursions:\n$H_x = 20\\,\\mathrm{mm}$\n$H_y = 15\\,\\mathrm{mm}$\nThus, the excursion vector is:\n$$\n\\vec{H} = H_x \\hat{i} + H_y \\hat{j} = 20\\hat{i} + 15\\hat{j}\\,\\mathrm{mm}\n$$\n\nNext, we compute the magnitude and direction of the vector $\\vec{H}$.

The area element for the sum is therefore $\\Delta x \\cdot \\Delta t = 2 \\cdot 0.5 = 1$ $\\mathrm{cm \\cdot s}$.\n\nFirst, we compute the quantity $P_{thresh}(x,t) = \\max(P(x,t) - 20, 0)$ for each given data point, where pressures are in $\\mathrm{mmHg}$.\n\n- At $x=3$ $\\mathrm{cm}$: $\\{ \\max(30-20,0), \\max(45-20,0), \\max(60-20,0), \\max(50-20,0), \\max(30-20,0) \\} = \\{10, 25, 40, 30, 10\\}$\n- At $x=5$ $\\mathrm{cm}$: $\\{ \\max(28-20,0), \\max(40-20,0), \\max(55-20,0), \\max(48-20,0), \\max(28-20,0) \\} = \\{8, 20, 35, 28, 8\\}$\n- At $x=7$ $\\mathrm{cm}$: $\\{ \\max(22-20,0), \\max(30-20,0), \\max(45-20,0), \\max(40-20,0), \\max(24-20,0) \\} = \\{2, 10, 25, 20, 4\\}$\n- At $x=9$ $\\mathrm{cm}$: $\\{ \\max(15-20,0), \\max(20-20,0), \\max(35-20,0), \\max(30-20,0), \\max(18-20,0) \\} = \\{0, 0, 15, 10, 0\\}$\n- At $x=11$ $\\mathrm{cm}$: $\\{ \\max(10-20,0), \\max(15-20,0), \\max(25-20,0), \\max(22-20,0), \\max(12-20,0) \\} = \\{0, 0, 5, 2, 0\\}$\n- At $x=13$ $\\mathrm{cm}$: $\\{ \\max(8-20,0), \\max(12-20,0), \\max(18-20,0), \\max(16-20,0), \\max(10-20,0) \\} = \\{0, 0, 0, 0, 0\\}$\n\nNext, we sum all these values:\n$\\sum P_{thresh} = (10+25+40+30+10) + (8+20+35+28+8) + (2+10+25+20+4) + (0+0+15+10+0) + (0+0+5+2+0) + (0)$\n$\\sum P_{thresh} = 115 + 99 + 61 + 25 + 7 + 0 = 307$ $\\mathrm{mmHg}$.\n\nFinally, we multiply this sum by the area element $\\Delta x \\cdot \\Delta t$:\n$\\mathrm{DCI} = 307 \\ \\mathrm{mmHg} \\cdot (1 \\ \\mathrm{cm \\cdot s}) = 307 \\ \\mathrm{mmHg \\cdot s \\cdot cm}$.\nRounding to four significant figures gives $307.0 \\ \\mathrm{mmHg \\cdot s \\cdot cm}$.\n\nPart 2: Calculation of the Distal Latency (DL)\n\nThe Distal Latency (DL) is the time coordinate of the intersection of two least-squares regression lines fitted to the arrival times of the $30$ $\\mathrm{mmHg}$ isobaric contour.\n\nThe proximal data set is $D_p = \\{(x, t_{30}(x))\\} = \\{(3, 2.0), (5, 2.4), (7, 2.8)\\}$.\nThe distal data set is $D_d = \\{(x, t_{30}(x))\\} = \\{(9, 3.7), (11, 4.7), (13, 5.7)\\}$.\n\nFor a set of points $(x_i, y_i)$, the slope $m$ and intercept $c$ of the least-squares line $y = mx+c$ are given by:\n$$\nm = \\frac{n(\\sum x_i y_i) - (\\sum x_i)(\\sum y_i)}{n(\\sum x_i^2) - (\\sum x_i)^2}, \\quad c = \\bar{y} - m\\bar{x}\n$$\n\nFor the proximal line, $t = m_p x + c_p$:\n$n_p = 3$.\n$\\sum x_i = 3+5+7 = 15$, so $\\bar{x}_p = 5$.\n$\\sum t_i = 2.0+2.4+2.8 = 7.2$, so $\\bar{t}_p = 2.4$.\n$\\sum x_i^2 = 3^2+5^2+7^2 = 9+25+49 = 83$.\n$\\sum x_i t_i = (3)(2.0) + (5)(2.4) + (7)(2.8) = 6 + 12 + 19.6 = 37.6$.\n$m_p = \\frac{3(37.6) - (15)(7.2)}{3(83) - (15)^2} = \\frac{112.8 - 108}{249 - 225} = \\frac{4.8}{24} = 0.2$.\n$c_p = \\bar{t}_p - m_p \\bar{x}_p = 2.4 - (0.2)(5) = 2.4 - 1 = 1.4$.\nThe proximal line is $t = 0.2x + 1.4$.\n\nFor the distal line, $t = m_d x + c_d$:\n$n_d = 3$.\n$\\sum x_i = 9+11+13 = 33$, so $\\bar{x}_d = 11$.\n$\\sum t_i = 3.7+4.7+5.7 = 14.1$, so $\\bar{t}_d = 4.7$.\n$\\sum x_i^2 = 9^2+11^2+13^2 = 81+121+169 = 371$.\n$\\sum x_i t_i = (9)(3.7) + (11)(4.7) + (13)(5.7) = 33.3 + 51.7 + 74.1 = 159.1$.\n$m_d = \\frac{3(159.1) - (33)(14.1)}{3(371) - (33)^2} = \\frac{477.3 - 465.3}{1113 - 1089} = \\frac{12}{24} = 0.5$.\n$c_d = \\bar{t}_d - m_d \\bar{x}_d = 4.7 - (0.5)(11) = 4.7 - 5.5 = -0.8$.\nThe distal line is $t = 0.5x - 0.8$.\n\nThe intersection point $(x_{cdp}, t_{cdp})$ is found by setting the two line equations equal. DL is defined as $t_{cdp}$.\n$0.2x_{cdp} + 1.4 = 0.5x_{cdp} - 0.8$\n$1.4 + 0.8 = 0.5x_{cdp} - 0.2x_{cdp}$\n$2.2 = 0.3x_{cdp}$\n$x_{cdp} = \\frac{2.2}{0.3} = \\frac{22}{3}$.\nNow, substitute $x_{cdp}$ into either line equation to find $\\mathrm{DL} = t_{cdp}$:\n$\\mathrm{DL} = 0.2 \\left(\\frac{22}{3}\\right) + 1.4 = \\frac{4.4}{3} + 1.4 = \\frac{4.4}{3} + \\frac{4.2}{3} = \\frac{8.6}{3} \\approx 2.866...$ $\\mathrm{s}$.\nAlternatively, $\\mathrm{DL} = \\frac{1}{5} \\left(\\frac{22}{3}\\right) + \\frac{7}{5} = \\frac{22}{15} + \\frac{21}{15} = \\frac{43}{15} \\approx 2.866...$ $\\mathrm{s}$.\nRounding to three significant figures gives $\\mathrm{DL} = 2.87$ $\\mathrm{s}$.\n\nPart 3: Swallow Categorization\n\nWe have the calculated metrics:\n$\\mathrm{DCI} = 307.0$ $\\mathrm{mmHg \\cdot s \\cdot cm}$.\n$\\mathrm{DL} = 2.87$ $\\mathrm{s}$.\n\nWe apply the given classification criteria:\n1.  Is it a weak contraction? $\\mathrm{DCI} < 450$. Yes, $307.0 < 450$.\n2.  Is it a premature contraction? $\\mathrm{DL} < 4.5$. Yes, $2.87 < 4.5$.\n3.  Is it a hypercontractile contraction? $\\mathrm{DCI} > 8000$. No, $307.0 < 8000$.\n4.  Is it a failed contraction? $\\mathrm{DCI} < 100$. No, $307.0 > 100$.\n\nThe contraction is both weak and premature. We now find the corresponding numeric code from the provided mapping.\n- Code $0$: Normal. No.\n- Code $1$: Premature only. No, it is also weak.\n- Code $2$: Weak only. No, it is also premature.\n- Code $3$: Failed. No.\n- Code $4$: Combined premature and weak. This matches our findings ($\\mathrm{DCI} < 450$ and $\\mathrm{DL} < 4.5$).\n- Code $5$: Hypercontractile. No.\n\nThe categorization code is $4$.\n\nThe final answer is a row matrix containing the DCI, DL, and the categorization code.",
