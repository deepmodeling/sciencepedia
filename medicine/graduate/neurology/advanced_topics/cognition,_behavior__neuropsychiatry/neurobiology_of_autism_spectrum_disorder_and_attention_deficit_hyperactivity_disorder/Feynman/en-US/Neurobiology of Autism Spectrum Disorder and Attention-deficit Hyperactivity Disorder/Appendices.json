The hypothesis that this process is impaired in Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), leading to an overabundance of synapses, is a cornerstone of modern research.

            "problem": "A central observation in the neurobiology of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is atypical synaptic pruning during early childhood. Consider a simplified, biologically grounded model in which synaptic pruning between ages $t \\in [2,5]$ years follows first-order loss kinetics: the instantaneous pruning rate is proportional to the current synaptic density. Let synaptic density be denoted by $S(t)$, and for typically developing children (Typical Development, TD) on $t \\in [2,5]$, assume $S_{\\mathrm{TD}}(t)$ satisfies the ordinary differential equation $dS_{\\mathrm{TD}}/dt=-k\\,S_{\\mathrm{TD}}$, where $k>0$ is constant over this interval. Empirically, suppose the normative curve over this interval is consistent with normalization $S_{\\mathrm{TD}}(2)=1.00$ (dimensionless units) and a measured value $S_{\\mathrm{TD}}(5)=0.70$. Now, assume that for Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), the pruning rate constant over $t \\in [2,5]$ is reduced by $15\\%$ relative to TD, with the same initial condition $S_{\\mathrm{ASD}}(2)=1.00$; that is, $k_{\\mathrm{ASD}}=0.85\\,k$.

It is a formalizable problem based on a simplified but reasonable biophysical model of synaptic pruning, using standard mathematical techniques. All necessary information is provided, and the problem is internally consistent.\n\nThe process to solve the problem is as follows:\nFirst, we solve the differential equation for synaptic density for a general case.\nSecond, we apply the specific conditions for the Typically Developing (TD) case to determine the rate constant $k$.\nThird, we use this constant to model the Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) case.\nFinally, we compute the required fractional difference in synaptic density.\n\nThe synaptic pruning process is modeled by a first-order kinetics differential equation:\n$$\n\\frac{dS}{dt} = -c S(t)\n$$\nwhere $S(t)$ is the synaptic density at time $t$ and $c$ is the rate constant. This is a separable ordinary differential equation. We can solve it by separating variables and integrating over the time interval from an initial time $t_0$ to a time $t$:\n$$\n\\int_{S(t_0)}^{S(t)} \\frac{dS'}{S'} = \\int_{t_0}^{t} -c \\, d\\tau\n$$\n$$\n\\ln(S(t)) - \\ln(S(t_0)) = -c(t - t_0)\n$$\n$$\n\\ln\\left(\\frac{S(t)}{S(t_0)}\\right) = -c(t - t_0)\n$$\nExponentiating both sides gives the solution for $S(t)$:\n$$\nS(t) = S(t_0) \\exp(-c(t - t_0))\n$$\n\nFor the Typically Developing (TD) case, the rate constant is $c=k$, the time interval is $t \\in [2, 5]$ years, and the initial condition is $S_{\\mathrm{TD}}(2) = 1.00$. The solution is:\n$$\nS_{\\mathrm{TD}}(t) = S_{\\mathrm{TD}}(2) \\exp(-k(t - 2)) = 1.00 \\exp(-k(t - 2))\n$$\nWe are given the synaptic density at $t=5$ years: $S_{\\mathrm{TD}}(5) = 0.70$.

Work within the average-reward formulation of reinforcement learning, where the temporal-difference reward prediction error is defined using the average reward rate $\\rho$ as a baseline, and widely accepted neurobiological evidence indicates that tonic striatal dopamine tracks the average reward rate. Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is associated with lower tonic striatal dopamine, and Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) often shows distinct, heterogeneous dopamine signaling profiles.\n\nAssume the following fundamental bases and modeling assumptions grounded in reinforcement learning theory and neurobiology:\n\n1.

The link between dopamine, average reward, and temporal discounting is a central hypothesis in the field (e.g., the work of Niv, Daw, and Dayan). The derivation of hyperbolic-like discounting from an exponential prior over exponential discount rates is a known theoretical result (Sozou, 1998; Kurth-Nelson et al., 2016). The premises are scientifically plausible for a theoretical modeling problem.\n2.  **Well-Posed**: The problem is well-posed.

The setup allows for the derivation of a unique, meaningful solution.\n3.  **Objective**: The problem is stated in precise, objective, and mathematical language. The contextual information about ADHD and ASD serves as motivation but does not introduce subjectivity into the mathematical task itself.\n4.  **Flaw Checklist**: The problem does not violate any of the specified flaw criteria. It is scientifically sound, formalizable, complete, feasible, well-structured, and non-trivial.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is deemed **valid**. A solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution Derivation\nThe objective is to compute the expected subjective value of the delayed reward by marginalizing over the uncertain discount rate $\\lambda$. The expected value, denoted $\\langle V \\rangle$, is obtained by integrating the value function $V(\\lambda)$ weighted by the prior probability density of $\\lambda$, $f(\\lambda \\mid \\kappa)$.\n\nThe value for a specific discount rate $\\lambda$ is given by:\n$$ V(\\lambda) = A \\exp(-\\lambda D) $$\nThe prior probability density over $\\lambda$ is given by an exponential distribution with rate parameter $\\kappa$:\n$$ f(\\lambda \\mid \\kappa) = \\kappa \\exp(-\\kappa \\lambda), \\quad \\text{for } \\lambda \\geq 0 $$\nThe expected subjective value $\\langle V \\rangle$ is therefore the expectation of $V(\\lambda)$ with respect to this distribution:\n$$ \\langle V \\rangle = E_{\\lambda}[V(\\lambda)] = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} V(\\lambda) f(\\lambda \\mid \\kappa) \\,d\\lambda $$\nSubstituting the expressions for $V(\\lambda)$ and $f(\\lambda \\mid \\kappa)$:\n$$ \\langle V \\rangle = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\left( A \\exp(-\\lambda D) \\right) \\left( \\kappa \\exp(-\\kappa \\lambda) \\right) \\,d\\lambda $$\nWe can combine the exponential terms and factor out the constants $A$ and $\\kappa$:\n$$ \\langle V \\rangle = A \\kappa \\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\exp(-\\lambda D - \\kappa \\lambda) \\,d\\lambda $$\n$$ \\langle V \\rangle = A \\kappa \\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\exp(-(\\kappa+D)\\lambda) \\,d\\lambda $$\nThis is a standard definite integral of an exponential function. The integral evaluates to:\n$$ \\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\exp(-ax) \\,dx = \\left[ -\\frac{1}{a} \\exp(-ax) \\right]_{0}^{\\infty} = 0 - \\left(-\\frac{1}{a} \\exp(0)\\right) = \\frac{1}{a} $$\nIn our case, the variable of integration is $\\lambda$ and the constant $a$ is $(\\kappa+D)$. Thus, the integral evaluates to $\\frac{1}{\\kappa+D}$.\nSubstituting this result back into the expression for $\\langle V \\rangle$:\n$$ \\langle V \\rangle = A \\kappa \\left( \\frac{1}{\\kappa+D} \\right) = A \\frac{\\kappa}{\\kappa+D} $$\nTo show that this expression can be written in the canonical hyperbolic form, we divide the numerator and the denominator of the fraction by $\\kappa$ (assuming $\\kappa > 0$, which is given):\n$$ \\langle V \\rangle = A \\frac{\\frac{\\kappa}{\\kappa}}{\\frac{\\kappa+D}{\\kappa}} = A \\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{D}{\\kappa}} $$\nThe canonical form for hyperbolic discounting is $V = A \\frac{1}{1+kD}$, where $k$ is the hyperbolic discount parameter. By comparing our derived form, $\\langle V \\rangle = A \\frac{1}{1 + D/\\kappa}$, with the canonical form, we can identify the relationship between $k$ and $\\kappa$:\n$$ kD = \\frac{D}{\\kappa} $$\nThis implies that the effective hyperbolic discount parameter $k$ is:\n$$ k = \\frac{1}{\\kappa} $$\nThe problem states that $\\kappa$ is a function of the average reward rate $\\rho$, which in turn depends on the tonic dopamine proxy $D_s$. The given relations are:\n$$ \\kappa = \\frac{\\gamma}{\\rho} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\rho = \\eta D_s $$\nWe substitute these into the expression for $k$. First, substituting for $\\kappa$:\n$$ k = \\frac{1}{\\frac{\\gamma}{\\rho}} = \\frac{\\rho}{\\gamma} $$\nNext, we substitute the expression for $\\rho$:\n$$ k = \\frac{\\eta D_s}{\\gamma} $$\nThis is the final expression for the effective hyperbolic discount parameter $k$ as a function of the task-specific uncertainty parameter $\\gamma$, the dopamine-to-reward-rate proportionality constant $\\eta$, and the tonic striatal dopamine proxy $D_s$. The units of $k$ are inverse time. This is consistent, as $\\lambda$ has units of inverse time, so $\\kappa$ (as the rate parameter of the prior on $\\lambda$) must have units of time. Therefore, $k=1/\\kappa$ has units of inverse time.",
