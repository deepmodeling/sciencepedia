All necessary information is provided for a unique solution.\n\nThe transport of the neurotoxicant is described by passive diffusion under steady-state conditions. We begin with Fick's first law of diffusion in one dimension. Let the $x$-axis be perpendicular to the planar barrier. The areal molar flux density, $j$, is proportional to the concentration gradient, $\\frac{dC_m}{dx}$, within the membrane:\n$$ j = -D_m \\frac{dC_m}{dx} $$\nwhere $D_m$ is the diffusion coefficient of the toxicant within the membrane material, and $C_m(x)$ is the concentration of the toxicant within the membrane at position $x$. This equation directly relates the flux density $j$ to the concentration gradient, fulfilling the first part of the problem.\n\nUnder steady-state conditions, the flux $j$ must be constant with respect to position $x$. We can separate variables and integrate this equation across the thickness of the membrane, $L$, from $x=0$ to $x=L$:\n$$ \\int_{0}^{L} j \\, dx = \\int_{C_m(0)}^{C_m(L)} -D_m \\, dC_m $$\nSince $j$ and $D_m$ are constant (for a homogeneous barrier), this yields:\n$$ j L = -D_m [C_m(L) - C_m(0)] = D_m [C_m(0) - C_m(L)] $$\nThe concentrations at the membrane interfaces, $C_m(0)$ and $C_m(L)$, are related to the concentrations in the adjacent bulk aqueous phases (e.g., blood and brain interstitial fluid) through the membrane-water partition coefficient, $K_p$. Let the bulk concentrations be $C_{\\text{blood}}$ and $C_{\\text{brain}}$. Assuming local equilibrium at the interfaces:\n$$ C_m(0) = K_p C_{\\text{blood}} $$\n$$ C_m(L) = K_p C_{\\text{brain}} $$\nSubstituting these into the integrated flux equation:\n$$ j L = D_m [K_p C_{\\text{blood}} - K_p C_{\\text{brain}}] $$\n$$ j = \\frac{K_p D_m}{L} (C_{\\text{blood}} - C_{\\text{brain}}) $$\nThe term $(C_{\\text{blood}} - C_{\\text{brain}})$ is the trans-barrier concentration difference, which is given as $\\Delta C$.\n$$ j = \\frac{K_p D_m}{L} \\Delta C $$\nThe problem defines the membrane permeability, $P$, as a lumped parameter that captures both partitioning and diffusion. The collection of constants multiplying $\\Delta C$ is precisely this permeability:\n$$ P \\equiv \\frac{K_p D_m}{L} $$\nThe units of $P$ are $(\\text{dimensionless}) \\times (\\mathrm{cm^2\\,s^{-1}}) / (\\mathrm{cm}) = \\mathrm{cm\\,s^{-1}}$, consistent with the problem statement.\n\nBy substituting the definition of $P$, we obtain the relationship between flux density, permeability, and the concentration difference:\n$$ j = P \\Delta C $$\nThe total steady-state molar transport rate, $J_{\\text{total}}$, is the flux density $j$ multiplied by the total surface area of the barrier, $A$.\n$$ J_{\\text{total}} = j A $$\nSubstituting the expression for $j$, we arrive at the final derived expression for the total transport rate solely in terms of $P$, $A$, and $\\Delta C$:\n$$ J_{\\text{total}} = P A \\Delta C $$\nThis completes the derivation part of the problem.\n\nNow, we must compute the numerical value of $J_{\\text{total}}$ using the provided data:\n- Permeability, $P = 10^{-5}\\ \\mathrm{cm\\,s^{-1}}$\n- Surface area, $A = 10^{3}\\ \\mathrm{cm^{2}}$\n- Concentration difference, $\\Delta C = 10^{-6}\\ \\mathrm{mol\\,cm^{-3}}$\n\nSubstituting these values into the derived expression:\n$$ J_{\\text{total}} = (10^{-5}\\ \\mathrm{cm\\,s^{-1}}) \\times (10^{3}\\ \\mathrm{cm^{2}}) \\times (10^{-6}\\ \\mathrm{mol\\,cm^{-3}}) $$\nThe units combine as follows: $(\\mathrm{cm\\,s^{-1}}) \\times (\\mathrm{cm^{2}}) \\times (\\mathrm{mol\\,cm^{-3}}) = \\mathrm{mol\\,s^{-1}}$, which is the correct unit for the total molar transport rate.\n\nPerforming the calculation:\n$$ J_{\\text{total}} = 10^{-5} \\times 10^{3} \\times 10^{-6}\\ \\mathrm{mol\\,s^{-1}} $$\n$$ J_{\\text{total}} = 10^{-5+3-6}\\ \\mathrm{mol\\,s^{-1}} $$\n$$ J_{\\text{total}} = 10^{-8}\\ \\mathrm{mol\\,s^{-1}} $$\nThe problem requires the answer to be expressed to $3$ significant figures.\n$$ J_{\\text{total}} = 1.00 \\times 10^{-8}\\ \\mathrm{mol\\,s^{-1}} $$",

It is a well-posed, scientifically grounded, and objective problem in quantitative biology. A full solution will be provided.\n\nThe analysis begins with the given mass-balance ordinary differential equation:\n$$\n\\frac{d[\\mathrm{ACh}]}{dt} = R - k[\\mathrm{ACh}]\n$$\nThis is a linear first-order non-homogeneous ODE.
