            "problem": "A patient aged $65$ years presents after a lacunar infarct centered in the right posterior limb of the internal capsule.

            "solution": "## PROBLEM VALIDATION\n\n### Step 1: Extract Givens\nThe problem statement provides the following information:\n*   **Patient:** A person aged $65$ years.\n*   **Lesion:** A lacunar infarct centered in the right posterior limb of the internal capsule.\n*   **Volitional Motor Deficit:** On command, the patient cannot elevate the left corner of his mouth or show his teeth on the left. The right lower face moves normally.\n*   **Emotional Motor Preservation:** During a humorous exchange, the patient displays a symmetric, spontaneous smile involving both the upper and lower face.\n*   **Sensory and Reflex Status:** There is no facial sensory loss, and corneal reflexes are intact bilaterally.\n*   **Core Question:** Why are emotionally driven facial movements preserved while volitional movement is impaired in this specific type of lesion?\n*   **Guiding Principles:** The explanation must be based on:\n    1.  The organization of corticobulbar pathways to the facial motor nucleus ($\\mathrm{CN\\ VII}$).\n    2.  The differential cortical input (bilateral vs. contralateral) to the upper versus lower facial musculature.\n    3.  The existence of separate limbic descending systems that influence brainstem motor nuclei.\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\nThe problem statement will be evaluated against the criteria for validity.\n\n*   **Scientific Grounding (Critical):** The clinical scenario describes emotional-volitional facial dissociation, a well-documented neurological phenomenon. The lesion location in the posterior limb of the internal capsule is a classic cause for a contralateral UMN-type facial palsy. The neuroanatomical principles cited (corticobulbar tracts, differential innervation of the facial nucleus, separate limbic motor pathways) are fundamental concepts in clinical neurology and neuroscience. The problem is scientifically sound and based on established principles.\n*   **Well-Posed:** The problem asks for a neuroanatomical explanation for a specific, well-described clinical sign. The provided principles are the necessary tools to construct this explanation. A unique and correct explanation exists within this framework. The problem is well-posed.\n*   **Objective (Critical):** The description of the patient's signs is objective and uses precise clinical language (e.g., \"cannot elevate the left corner of his mouth,\" \"displays a symmetric, spontaneous smile\"). The question is a direct inquiry into a mechanism, free of subjective or opinion-based elements. The problem is objective.\n*   **Completeness and Consistency:** The information is sufficient and internally consistent. A right-sided central lesion is expected to cause left-sided deficits. The specific pattern of weakness (contralateral lower face for voluntary movement but not emotional movement, with preserved upper face) is a classic presentation of an upper motor neuron (UMN) lesion affecting the corticobulbar tract but sparing the extrapyramidal emotional pathways. The intact corneal reflex further supports a central lesion above the level of the pontine reflex arc.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem statement is scientifically valid, well-posed, objective, and internally consistent. It presents a classic neuroanatomical problem that is solvable using the stated first principles. Therefore, the solution process will proceed.\n\n## SOLUTION DERIVATION\n\nThe clinical presentation is a dissociation between voluntary and emotional facial movements, localized to the left lower face, resulting from a lesion in the right internal capsule. We must explain this using the provided neuroanatomical principles.\n\n1.  **Volitional Facial Motor Pathway:** Voluntary control of the face originates in the primary motor cortex (in the precentral gyrus). Descending projections form the corticobulbar tract. These fibers travel through the genu and posterior limb of the internal capsule, through the cerebral peduncle, and synapse in the contralateral brainstem motor nuclei. For the facial nerve ($\\mathrm{CN\\ VII}$), the motor nucleus is located in the caudal pons.\n\n2.  **Differential Innervation of the Facial Nucleus:** The facial motor nucleus has two functional subdivisions:\n    *   The dorsal part innervates the muscles of the *upper face* (e.g., frontalis, orbicularis oculi). This part receives **bilateral** projections from the motor cortices of both cerebral hemispheres.\n    *   The ventral part innervates the muscles of the *lower face* (e.g., zygomaticus, orbicularis oris, buccinator). This part receives predominantly **contralateral** projections from the motor cortex.\n\n3.  **Impact of the Patient's Lesion on Volitional Movement:** The patient has a lacunar infarct in the *right* posterior limb of the internal capsule. This lesion interrupts the *right* corticobulbar tract.\n    *   **Lower Face:** The left ventral facial nucleus, which controls the left lower face, loses its primary input from the right motor cortex. This results in weakness of the left lower face on voluntary command (e.g., inability to raise the left corner of the mouth). This is an upper motor neuron (UMN) type contralateral lower facial palsy, which matches the patient's signs.\n    *   **Upper Face:** The left dorsal facial nucleus, which controls the left upper face, is largely unaffected because it continues to receive input from the intact *left* motor cortex via its uncrossed corticobulbar fibers. Thus, volitional movement of the forehead is spared.\n\n4.  **Emotional Facial Motor Pathway:** Spontaneous or emotional facial expressions (e.g., a genuine smile, a cry of pain) are not initiated by the primary motor cortex. Instead, they are driven by a phylogenetically older, distinct motor system originating in limbic and paralimbic areas, such as the anterior cingulate gyrus, insula, amygdala, and hypothalamus.\n\n5.  **Descending Emotional Pathway and Dissociation:** Projections from these limbic structures descend to the brainstem motor nuclei via pathways that are separate from the pyramidal (corticobulbar) system. These pathways, which include reticulobulbar fibers from the reticular formation, travel more medially in the brainstem and are not typically contained within the same part of the internal capsule as the main corticobulbar tract. Crucially, these emotional motor projections are distributed **bilaterally** to the entire facial nucleus (both upper and lower portions).\n\n6.  **Synthesizing the Explanation:** The patient's lesion in the right internal capsule selectively damages the volitional corticobulbar pathway. This explains the contralateral (left) lower facial weakness on command. However, the separate, bilaterally projecting emotional motor system is anatomically spared by this lesion. When the patient experiences a genuine emotion (humor), these intact limbic-reticular pathways successfully activate the facial nuclei on both sides, including the ventral part of the left facial nucleus. This produces a symmetrical, spontaneous smile, overriding the volitional paresis. This explains the observed emotional-volitional dissociation.\n\n## OPTION-BY-OPTION ANALYSIS\n\n**A. Bilateral limbic-derived projections from anterior cingulate, amygdalo-hypothalamic circuits descend via reticulobulbar pathways to the facial nucleus, bypassing damaged corticobulbar fibers; therefore, emotionally driven expressions are preserved despite volitional paresis.**\n*   **Justification:** This option provides a complete and accurate neuroanatomical explanation. It correctly identifies the limbic origins of emotional expression (anterior cingulate, amygdalo-hypothalamic circuits), the separate descending pathway (reticulobulbar pathways), the bilateral nature of these projections, and the fact that this system bypasses the damaged corticobulbar tract (the pyramidal pathway for volitional movement). This perfectly explains the preservation of spontaneous smiling in the presence of volitional paresis.\n*   **Verdict:** **Correct**.\n\n**B. An ipsilateral trigeminofacial polysynaptic reflex arc mediates voluntary smiles in response to instruction, preserving lower facial movement even when corticobulbar fibers are interrupted.**\n*   **Justification:** This statement is flawed in multiple respects. First, a smile \"in response to instruction\" is a voluntary act, not a reflex. Second, reflex arcs like the trigeminofacial reflex (e.g., corneal reflex) are involuntary and do not mediate volitional movements. Third, the patient's voluntary movement of the left lower face is *impaired*, not preserved. This option contradicts the clinical facts of the case.\n*   **Verdict:** **Incorrect**.\n\n**C. Parasympathetic salivatory components of CN VII independently innervate the zygomaticus major and orbicularis oculi during emotional responses, so spontaneous smiles persist after motor pathway lesions.**\n*   **Justification:** This is fundamentally incorrect. The parasympathetic fibers of $\\mathrm{CN\\ VII}$ are secretomotor to glands (lacrimal, submandibular, sublingual); they do not provide motor innervation to the skeletal muscles of facial expression like zygomaticus major or orbicularis oculi. These muscles are innervated by special visceral efferent (branchiomotor) fibers originating from the facial motor nucleus proper.\n*   **Verdict:** **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. Preservation of movement is confined to the forehead due to bilateral cortical input; lower facial emotional movement should be lost after an internal capsular lesion.**\n*   **Justification:** The first part of this statement—that preservation of *volitional* movement is confined to the forehead due to bilateral cortical input—is correct. However, the conclusion that \"lower facial emotional movement should be lost\" is incorrect and directly contradicted by the patient's clinical signs. The statement fails to account for the separate, preserved emotional motor system.\n*   **Verdict:** **Incorrect**.\n\n**E. In lower motor neuron lesions of CN VII, such as Bell’s palsy, emotional smiles are typically preserved because limbic pathways reach the nerve distal to the nucleus.**\n*   **Justification:** This statement is incorrect on two major points. First, the patient has an *upper* motor neuron lesion (central), not a lower motor neuron (LMN) lesion like Bell's palsy (peripheral). In an LMN lesion, all motor output through the nerve is lost, affecting both voluntary and emotional movements of the entire ipsilateral face. Second, central pathways (both limbic and volitional) synapse at the level of the *nucleus* in the brainstem, not on the peripheral nerve distal to the nucleus. Damaging the nerve itself (the \"final common pathway\") paralyzes the muscles regardless of the central origin of the signal.\n*   **Verdict:** **Incorrect**.",

            "id": "4473732",
            "problem": "A neurophysiology laboratory is asked to help localize the substrate of a unilateral facial weakness by using the blink reflex paradigm. The blink reflex is elicited by electrical stimulation of the supraorbital branch of the trigeminal nerve and recorded by surface electromyography (EMG) from the orbicularis oculi muscles bilaterally. The reflex has two components: an early ipsilateral response, denoted R$1$, mediated by a short oligosynaptic pathway in the pons linking the principal trigeminal sensory nucleus to the ipsilateral facial motor nucleus, and a later bilateral response, denoted R$2$, mediated by polysynaptic interneuronal circuits that involve the spinal trigeminal nucleus and reticular formation with projections to both facial motor nuclei. The afferent limb is trigeminal; the efferent limb to each side is the facial nerve.\n\nAssume that stimulation can be delivered to either supraorbital nerve and recordings are obtained from both orbicularis oculi muscles simultaneously on every trial. Using only these core circuit properties, predict which pattern of R$1$/R$2$ abnormalities reliably differentiates a lesion of brainstem interneuronal circuits from a peripheral facial nerve lesion. Choose the single best option that specifies, in words, the expected abnormalities for each of the two localizations.\n\nA. Brainstem interneuron lesion: selective loss of R$2$ on the side of the lesion, regardless of which side is stimulated, with preservation of R$1$ bilaterally. Peripheral facial nerve lesion: absence of both R$1$ and R$2$ when recording from the affected side for stimulation of either side, with preservation of responses recorded from the unaffected side.\n\nB. Brainstem interneuron lesion: absence of R$1$ ipsilateral to the lesion for stimulation of either side, with preservation of R$2$ bilaterally. Peripheral facial nerve lesion: isolated prolongation of R$1$ latency on the affected side, with normal R$2$ bilaterally.\n\nC.

Peripheral facial nerve lesion: bilateral absence of R$1$ with preserved R$2$.\n\nD. Brainstem interneuron lesion: absence of all responses only when stimulating the side of the lesion, with normal responses when stimulating the opposite side. Peripheral facial nerve lesion: loss of contralateral R$2$ only, with preserved ipsilateral responses.",
            "solution": "The problem statement describes the blink reflex circuit and asks for the pattern of abnormalities in its components, R$1$ and R$2$, that can differentiate between a peripheral facial nerve lesion and a brainstem interneuronal lesion. To solve this, we must logically deduce the consequences of each lesion by tracing the neural signals through the described pathways.\n\nLet's denote stimulation of the right supraorbital nerve as $S_R$ and the left as $S_L$. Let's denote a recording from the right orbicularis oculi as $Rec_R$ and from the left as $Rec_L$. An R$1$ response is always ipsilateral to stimulation (e.g., $S_R$ elicits R$1$ at $Rec_R$). An R$2$ response is bilateral (e.g., $S_R$ elicits R$2$ at both $Rec_R$ and $Rec_L$).\n\nWe will analyze two distinct, unilateral lesion scenarios. Without loss of generality, we will assume the lesion is on the right side.\n\n### Analysis of a Peripheral Facial Nerve Lesion\n\nA peripheral lesion of the right facial nerve (cranial nerve VII) means that the final efferent pathway to the right orbicularis oculi muscle is non-functional. The muscle cannot contract in response to any neural signal.\n\n1.  **Stimulation of the right side ($S_R$):**\n    *   The afferent signal travels correctly via the right trigeminal nerve (CN V) to the brainstem.\n    *   **R$1$ Response:** The signal is processed in the pons and sent to the right facial motor nucleus. This central pathway is intact. However, the efferent signal from the nucleus cannot reach the right orbicularis oculi muscle because the right facial nerve is lesioned. Therefore, no R$1$ response is recorded on the right side ($Rec_R$).\n    *   **R$2$ Response:** The signal is processed by the brainstem interneurons, which project to both the right and left facial motor nuclei. The central pathways are intact.\n        *   At the right facial nucleus, the outgoing efferent signal is blocked by the lesion. No R$2$ response is recorded on the right side ($Rec_R$).\n        *   At the left facial nucleus, the outgoing efferent signal travels down the intact left facial nerve. A normal R$2$ response is recorded on the left side ($Rec_L$).\n\n2.  **Stimulation of the left side ($S_L$):**\n    *   The afferent signal travels correctly via the left trigeminal nerve (CN V) to the brainstem.\n    *   **R$1$ Response:** The signal is processed and sent to the left facial motor nucleus. The efferent signal travels down the intact left facial nerve. A normal R$1$ response is recorded on the left side ($Rec_L$).\n    *   **R$2$ Response:** The signal is processed by the brainstem interneurons, which project to both facial motor nuclei.\n        *   At the right facial nucleus, the outgoing signal is blocked by the lesion. No R$2$ response is recorded on the right side ($Rec_R$).\n        *   At the left facial nucleus, the outgoing signal travels down the intact left facial nerve. A normal R$2$ response is recorded on the left side ($Rec_L$).\n\n**Conclusion for a Peripheral Facial Nerve Lesion:** There is a complete absence of all responses (both R$1$ and R$2$) when recording from the affected side ($Rec_R$), regardless of whether stimulation is ipsilateral ($S_R$) or contralateral ($S_L$). Responses recorded from the unaffected side ($Rec_L$) are preserved.\n\n### Analysis of a Brainstem Interneuron Lesion\n\nA lesion of the right-sided brainstem interneuronal circuits specifically affects the polysynaptic pathway responsible for the R$2$ response. The problem states that the R$1$ pathway (a short oligosynaptic circuit in the pons) is separate. Therefore, the R$1$ pathway, the afferent trigeminal nerves, the facial motor nuclei, and the efferent facial nerves are all intact. The lesion is localized to the central processing of the R$2$ response on the right side. This means that any R$2$ response that relies on these right-sided interneurons to activate a facial nucleus will be affected. Specifically, activation of the right facial nucleus for an R$2$ response will fail.\n\n1.  **Stimulation of the right side ($S_R$):**\n    *   The afferent signal travels correctly via the right trigeminal nerve.\n    *   **R$1$ Response:** The signal follows the separate, intact R$1$ pathway (right principal trigeminal nucleus to right facial motor nucleus). A normal R$1$ response is recorded on the right side ($Rec_R$).\n    *   **R$2$ Response:** The signal is processed for the R$2$ response.\n        *   The right-sided interneurons responsible for activating the right facial nucleus are lesioned. Therefore, no R$2$ response is recorded on the right side ($Rec_R$).\n        *   The pathways that cross the midline to activate the left-sided interneurons and the left facial nucleus are intact. A normal R$2$ response is recorded on the left side ($Rec_L$).\n\n2.  **Stimulation of the left side ($S_L$):**\n    *   The afferent signal travels correctly via the left trigeminal nerve.\n    *   **R$1$ Response:** The signal follows the intact left-sided R$1$ pathway. A normal R$1$ response is recorded on the left side ($Rec_L$).\n    *   **R$2$ Response:** The signal is processed by the intact left-sided interneurons.\n        *   These interneurons activate the left facial nucleus, and a normal R$2$ response is recorded on the left side ($Rec_L$).\n        *   These interneurons also send signals across the midline to activate the right facial nucleus. However, this activation is mediated by the right-sided interneuronal pool, which is lesioned. Therefore, no R$2$ response is recorded on the right side ($Rec_R$).\n\n**Conclusion for a Brainstem Interneuron Lesion:** The R$1$ response is preserved whenever it is tested (i.e., ipsilateral to stimulation). There is a selective absence of the R$2$ response on the side of the lesion ($Rec_R$), regardless of the side of stimulation ($S_R$ or $S_L$). The R$2$ response on the unaffected side ($Rec_L$) is preserved. This pattern is distinct from the peripheral lesion because the R$1$ response on the affected side is present.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n*   **A. Brainstem interneuron lesion: selective loss of R$2$ on the side of the lesion, regardless of which side is stimulated, with preservation of R$1$ bilaterally. Peripheral facial nerve lesion: absence of both R$1$ and R$2$ when recording from the affected side for stimulation of either side, with preservation of responses recorded from the unaffected side.**\n    *   This option's description for the brainstem lesion perfectly matches our derivation. The phrase \"preservation of R$1$ bilaterally\" correctly implies that the mechanism for producing an R$1$ response on either side is intact, even though an R$1$ is only ever recorded ipsilaterally.\n    *   This option's description for the peripheral facial nerve lesion also perfectly matches our derivation.\n    *   **Verdict: Correct**\n\n*   **B. Brainstem interneuron lesion: absence of R$1$ ipsilateral to the lesion for stimulation of either side, with preservation of R$2$ bilaterally. Peripheral facial nerve lesion: isolated prolongation of R$1$ latency on the affected side, with normal R$2$ bilaterally.**\n    *   The description for the brainstem lesion is incorrect. The problem states the R$1$ pathway is separate from the R$2$ interneuronal circuits, so R$1$ should be preserved, not absent.\n    *   The description for the peripheral lesion is incorrect. A complete lesion causes absence, not just prolongation. Furthermore, it would affect both R$1$ and R$2$ recorded from the affected side, not just R$1$.\n    *   **Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n*   **C. Brainstem interneuron lesion: bilateral absence of R$2$ only when stimulating the side contralateral to the lesion, with normal R$1$. Peripheral facial nerve lesion: bilateral absence of R$1$ with preserved R$2$.**\n    *   The description for the brainstem lesion is incorrect. Stimulation ipsilateral to the lesion would also yield an abnormal R$2$ pattern (specifically, an absent ipsilateral R$2$). A bilateral absence of R$2$ is also not the expected finding from a unilateral lesion.\n    *   The description for the peripheral lesion is incorrect. A unilateral lesion cannot cause \"bilateral absence of R$1$\". It would also cause absence of R$2$ on the affected side.\n    *   **Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n*   **D. Brainstem interneuron lesion: absence of all responses only when stimulating the side of the lesion, with normal responses when stimulating the opposite side. Peripheral facial nerve lesion: loss of contralateral R$2$ only, with preserved ipsilateral responses.**\n    *   The description for the brainstem lesion describes a lesion of the afferent trigeminal nerve (CN V), not a central interneuron lesion.\n    *   The description for the peripheral lesion is incorrect. A peripheral facial nerve lesion affects the efferent pathway, causing loss of *ipsilateral* responses (R$1$ and R$2$), not the contralateral R$2$.\n    *   **Verdict: Incorrect**",

This means the CMAP amplitude will be at baseline, offering no prognostic information. Performing ENoG during this period would give \"false reassurance\" that the nerve is fine, even if it has suffered an injury that will lead to severe degeneration. Since the latent period $t_{0}$ can last up to $3$ days, any reliable ENoG testing must be initiated **after** day $3$ (i.e., for $t > 3$ days or $t \\ge 72$ hours after onset).\n\n2.  **Constraint 2: Detecting the Poor-Prognosis Threshold.**\n    The criterion for a poor prognosis is $f(t) \\le 0.1$. We need to calculate the time $t$ at which this threshold is crossed. This occurs when $t \\ge t_{0}$. We solve the equation:\n    $$ \\exp\\!\\Big(-\\dfrac{t-t_{0}}{\\tau}\\Big) \\le 0.1 $$\n    Taking the natural logarithm of both sides (and remembering that $\\ln(x)$ is a monotonically increasing function, so it preserves the inequality):\n    $$ -\\dfrac{t-t_{0}}{\\tau} \\le \\ln(0.1) $$\n    We know that $\\ln(0.1) = \\ln(10^{-1}) = -\\ln(10)$.\n    $$ -\\dfrac{t-t_{0}}{\\tau} \\le -\\ln(10) $$\n    Multiplying by $-1$ reverses the inequality sign:\n    $$ \\dfrac{t-t_{0}}{\\tau} \\ge \\ln(10) $$\n    $$ t-t_{0} \\ge \\tau \\ln(10) $$\n    $$ t \\ge t_{0} + \\tau \\ln(10) $$\n    Now, we substitute the given parameter values: $\\tau \\approx 2$ days and $\\ln(10) \\approx 2.3026$.\n    $$ t \\ge t_{0} + (2)(2.3026) \\approx t_{0} + 4.6 \\text{ days} $$\n    The time to reach the $90\\%$ degeneration level depends on the start time of the degeneration, $t_{0}$. We consider the range for $t_{0}$:\n    - If $t_{0} = 2$ days (earliest degeneration onset), the threshold is reached at $t \\ge 2 + 4.6 = 6.6$ days.\n    - If $t_{0} = 3$ days (latest degeneration onset), the threshold is reached at $t \\ge 3 + 4.6 = 7.6$ days.\n\n3.  **Synthesis of the Optimal Strategy.**\n    - Testing must begin after day $3$.\n    - The definitive sign of severe degeneration ($>90\\%$ loss) will manifest, if it is going to occur, between approximately day $7$ and day $8$.\n    - A testing strategy should therefore focus on the period following day $3$, with the expectation that the most critical information regarding severe cases will become available around days $7-10$. This allows for confirmation of the trend and crossing of the threshold.\n    - Since degeneration is a dynamic process evolving over several days (with a time constant $\\tau=2$ days), a single test might not be sufficient. Serial testing (e.g., every $2$ days, which is on the order of $\\tau$) after the latent period is a logical approach to track the trajectory of $f(t)$.\n    - The entire process must conclude by day $14$.\n\nThe derived optimal strategy is: Initiate ENoG on or after day $3$. Repeat the test every few days to track the decay. Expect the most definitive prognostic information for severe cases to emerge in the window from approximately day $7$ to day $10$.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. Perform ENoG within the first $24$ hours to capture the earliest changes and repeat only if abnormal.**\nThis strategy is flawed. A test within $24$ hours ($t=1$ day) falls squarely within the latent period ($t_{0} \\in [2, 3]$ days), where $f(t)=1$. The result will be normal, providing false reassurance. It directly contradicts the need to avoid the latent period.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**B. Perform ENoG between $24$ and $48$ hours; if amplitudes are preserved, conclude prognosis is favorable without further testing.**\nThis corresponds to testing between $t=1$ and $t=2$ days. This is still inside the latent period for most or all cases ($t_{0} \\approx 2$ to $3$ days). A preserved amplitude is expected and is prognostically meaningless at this stage. Concluding a favorable prognosis is a critical error based on the provided model.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. Initiate ENoG at or after $72$ hours and repeat every $2$ days through day $14$, with the first definitive prognostic interpretation targeted around days $7$ to $10$ when greater than $90\\%$ degeneration, if present, can be detected.**\nThis strategy aligns perfectly with the derivation.\n- \"Initiate ENoG at or after $72$ hours\" ($t \\ge 3$ days): This correctly waits for the latent period to end.\n- \"repeat every $2$ days\": This is a sound approach for a process with a time constant $\\tau=2$ days.\n- \"definitive prognostic interpretation targeted around days $7$ to $10$\": This window ($t \\in [7, 10]$ days) correctly identifies the time when the $f(t) \\le 0.1$ threshold would be crossed in severe cases ($t \\approx 6.6 - 7.6$ days).\n- The strategy respects the $14$-day actionable timeframe.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**D. Defer ENoG until after day $21$ to ensure WD is complete and minimize confounding by transient conduction failure.**\nThe problem explicitly states that results are needed within a \"clinically actionable time (by day $14$)\". Deferring the test until day $21$ violates this core requirement. While waiting longer provides a more complete picture of the final outcome, it fails the stated goal of early prognostication.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**E. Perform ENoG only at $6$ weeks to avoid early variability and to allow denervation to fully mature.**\n$6$ weeks is $42$ days. Similar to option D, this is far too late and violates the $14$-day actionable timeframe for prognostication.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**",
