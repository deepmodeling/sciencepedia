The head impulse consists of a constant angular velocity of $\\omega_{h} = 300^{\\circ}/\\mathrm{s}$ applied until a total head rotation of $\\theta_{h} = 30^{\\circ}$ is reached. The vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR) operates with a constant gain deficit defined as $D = 1 - G$, where $G$ is the VOR gain. During the impulse, the eye velocity produced by the VOR is modeled as $\\omega_{e}(t) = -G\\,\\omega_{h}(t)$, and ideal gaze stabilization requires that the sum of head rotation and eye rotation equals zero to maintain fixation on a stationary target.\n\nAssume that no saccades occur during the impulse and that a single corrective saccade at the end of the impulse exactly nulls the accumulated gaze position error. Given a VOR gain deficit of $D = 0.40$, compute the expected amplitude $A_{s}$ of this corrective saccade. Express your answer in degrees.

            "introduction": "While peripheral lesions disrupt the VOR, central pathologies often manifest as a failure to modulate vestibular reflexes. This practice focuses on fixation suppression, a cerebellar function that allows visual targets to override nystagmus. You will learn to calculate the fixation suppression index from clinical data, providing a quantitative measure that can help distinguish a central from a peripheral cause of nystagmus. ",

            "problem": "A patient undergoing caloric testing shows spontaneous nystagmus modulated by visual fixation. In darkness (no fixation), the vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR) generates a slow-phase eye velocity. In the presence of a stationary visual target (fixation), central mechanisms, particularly the cerebellar flocculus, suppress the VOR-driven slow phase. The degree of suppression is operationally defined as the relative reduction in slow-phase velocity (SPV) from the darkness condition to the fixation condition, expressed as a dimensionless fraction of the darkness value.\n\nVideo-oculography recorded three trials of SPV in each condition, but the device is later determined to have a uniform multiplicative calibration bias that overestimates all SPV values by a factor of $1.02$ across both conditions.

No units are required for the final answer because it is dimensionless.\n\nAssume that, for interpretation, suppression is considered abnormally reduced if the suppression index is less than $0.6$. After computing the index, determine whether the suppression implied by your result would be classified as normal or abnormal, but do not include this interpretation in the final numeric answer.",
            "solution": "The fixation suppression index, $S$, is defined as the relative reduction in slow-phase velocity (SPV) from the darkness condition (baseline) to the fixation condition.

            "introduction": "Effective diagnosis requires moving beyond isolated signs to a systematic, integrated approach. This problem challenges you to apply your understanding of vestibular physiology to design a clinical decision algorithm for patients with acute vertigo. By weighing the significance of findings from the HINTS exam, hearing tests, and other clinical factors, you will practice the high-level synthesis required to safely differentiate benign peripheral conditions from dangerous central ones like stroke.

            "problem": "An emergency department with limited immediate imaging capabilities is developing an algorithm for adult patients presenting with acute dizziness. The design mandate is to separate central from peripheral etiologies using bedside physiology and basic audiovestibular examination. The population of interest is patients with either acute vestibular syndrome (continuous vertigo, spontaneous nystagmus, nausea/vomiting, intolerance to head motion, and gait unsteadiness lasting $\\!24$ hours) or triggered episodic positional vertigo (brief vertigo provoked by positional change). The algorithm must integrate the Head-Impulse—Nystagmus—Test of Skew (HINTS) examination, simple hearing assessment, positional maneuvers, and vascular risk factors, and specify branching criteria that minimize missed posterior circulation stroke while avoiding inappropriate testing in benign paroxysmal positional vertigo.\n\nFundamental base for the design:\n- The vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR) stabilizes gaze during rapid head rotations; acutely reduced unilateral peripheral VOR gain produces an abnormal horizontal head-impulse test with a corrective saccade toward the lesion side, whereas intact brainstem-cerebellar circuitry typically preserves the head-impulse test in central causes.\n- Peripheral spontaneous nystagmus in acute unilateral vestibulopathy is classically unidirectional horizontal-torsional, follows Alexander’s law (increases with gaze toward the fast phase), and does not change direction with gaze; central lesions commonly produce direction-changing gaze-evoked nystagmus or vertical nystagmus.\n- Skew deviation indicates an otolithic pathway imbalance, more commonly central (brainstem) than peripheral.\n- Sudden sensorineural hearing loss during acute vestibular syndrome raises concern for anterior inferior cerebellar artery territory infarction when paired with an otherwise central oculomotor pattern; hearing loss with an otherwise peripheral pattern suggests labyrinthitis.\n- Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) is a triggered episodic vestibular syndrome; diagnosis is positional with Dix–Hallpike for posterior canal and supine roll for horizontal canal; continuous spontaneous vertigo is not typical of BPPV.\n- Vascular risk factors (age $\\geq 60$ years, atrial fibrillation, recent transient ischemic attack, severe truncal ataxia unable to sit or stand unaided, new focal neurological deficits) increase pretest probability for central causes and can act as override criteria when present concurrently with concerning oculomotor or auditory signs.\n\nSelect the single option that best specifies an ED decision tree integrating these elements to separate central from peripheral vertigo. Each option is a complete branching algorithm; choose the one that is most physiologically sound and operationally safe.\n\nA. Start by performing positional maneuvers (Dix–Hallpike and supine roll) on all patients with acute dizziness to classify BPPV versus non-BPPV. If positional maneuvers are negative, use HINTS. For HINTS classification, require all three central signs (normal head impulse, direction-changing nystagmus, and skew deviation) to call a central etiology; if only one or two central signs are present, classify as peripheral. Consider hearing loss only after HINTS, and if new unilateral hearing loss is present, label the case as peripheral labyrinthitis regardless of HINTS findings. Vascular risk factors influence disposition but do not change the central versus peripheral classification.\n\nB. Begin by separating temporal pattern: if the vertigo is continuous for $\\!24$ hours with spontaneous nystagmus, proceed to HINTS; if the vertigo is brief and strictly positional, perform Dix–Hallpike and supine roll. In the acute vestibular syndrome branch, define central etiology only when two or more central HINTS signs are present. If there is new unilateral hearing loss, classify as peripheral unless National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) is $\\geq 4$, in which case classify as central. Do not use severe truncal ataxia or focal neurological deficits to override a peripheral HINTS pattern. In the positional branch, a positive Dix–Hallpike test establishes posterior canal BPPV, and a negative test excludes BPPV.\n\nC. First branch by temporal pattern. If continuous acute vestibular syndrome is present (persistent symptoms $\\!24$ hours with spontaneous nystagmus), perform HINTS before positional testing. Define central etiology when any one central HINTS sign is present: a normal (bilaterally intact) horizontal head-impulse test, direction-changing gaze-evoked nystagmus, or positive test of skew. If HINTS is peripheral (abnormal unilateral head-impulse with corrective saccade, unidirectional horizontal-torsional nystagmus following Alexander’s law, and no skew), add a simple hearing assessment; with new unilateral sensorineural hearing loss, classify as peripheral labyrinthitis if the head-impulse test is abnormal, but classify as central (anterior inferior cerebellar artery territory stroke) if the head-impulse test is normal. Independently override toward central if there are new focal neurological deficits or severe truncal ataxia (unable to sit or stand unaided), regardless of HINTS. In the triggered episodic branch, perform Dix–Hallpike and supine roll; a positive positional test with brief, fatigable vertigo and characteristic canal-specific nystagmus classifies as peripheral BPPV, while continuous spontaneous vertigo, direction-changing nystagmus, vertical nystagmus, or inability to sit upright prompts reclassification to the acute vestibular syndrome branch and central evaluation. Vascular risk factors (age $\\geq 60$ years, atrial fibrillation) increase central suspicion but do not alone overturn a peripheral HINTS without concerning neurological signs.\n\nD. Do not separate temporal patterns; apply HINTS only after a brain Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scan. Classify central when head-impulse is abnormal bilaterally or when nystagmus is unidirectional with suppression by fixation. Treat hearing loss as a benign peripheral marker unless accompanied by diplopia. Use positional maneuvers to confirm central vertigo when vertigo persists despite repeated Dix–Hallpike tests. Allow vascular risk factors (any single risk factor present) to automatically assign central classification even with a peripheral HINTS pattern.",
            "solution": "The problem requires selecting the most physiologically sound and operationally safe decision algorithm. The optimal algorithm must correctly apply the provided principles of vestibular diagnosis. We can evaluate each option against these principles.\n\n1.  **Initial Triage:** The first crucial step is to separate patients by their temporal pattern of symptoms. Patients with acute vestibular syndrome (AVS, continuous vertigo) have a high risk of stroke and need immediate evaluation with HINTS, whereas patients with triggered episodic vertigo are most likely to have BPPV, which is diagnosed with positional maneuvers.\n2.  **HINTS Application:** For AVS, the HINTS exam is the key tool. A central cause is suspected if **any one** of the following is present: a **N**ormal Head **I**mpulse test, **D**irection-changing **N**ystagmus, or **T**est of **S**kew. A peripheral pattern requires all three converse findings.\n3.  **Safety Overrides:** Major neurological signs like severe truncal ataxia or new focal deficits must override any benign-appearing HINTS result and trigger a central workup.\n4.  **Hearing Assessment (HINTS Plus):** New unilateral hearing loss in the context of AVS requires careful interpretation. Combined with a peripheral HINTS pattern (abnormal HIT), it suggests labyrinthitis. Combined with a central HINTS pattern (especially a normal HIT), it strongly suggests an AICA territory stroke.\n\nLet's evaluate the options based on this framework:\n\n-   **Option A:** Fails on all major points. It incorrectly applies positional maneuvers to all patients first, requires all three central HINTS signs (dangerously insensitive), and misinterprets the significance of hearing loss, ignoring the risk of AICA stroke.\n-   **Option B:** Fails on sensitivity and safety. It correctly separates by temporal pattern but incorrectly requires two central HINTS signs, weakening the test's sensitivity. It also dangerously dismisses override criteria like severe truncal ataxia.\n-   **Option D:** Inverts established clinical logic. It postpones HINTS until after an MRI, which defeats its purpose as a bedside tool. It incorrectly defines a central sign (unidirectional nystagmus with suppression by fixation is peripheral) and is overly broad with its use of vascular risk factors.\n-   **Option C:** This option correctly implements all the key principles. It starts with the correct temporal pattern triage. It correctly defines a central HINTS finding as the presence of *any one* of the central signs. It correctly incorporates hearing assessment (\"HINTS Plus\") to differentiate labyrinthitis from AICA stroke. It correctly includes safety overrides for major neurological signs. Finally, its pathway for triggered episodic vertigo is appropriate, using positional maneuvers and correctly identifying atypical findings that warrant re-routing to a central workup.\n\nTherefore, Option C represents the most physiologically sound and operationally safe algorithm.",
