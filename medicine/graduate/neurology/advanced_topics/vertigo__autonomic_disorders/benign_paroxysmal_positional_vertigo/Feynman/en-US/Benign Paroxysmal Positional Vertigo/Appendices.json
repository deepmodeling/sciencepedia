This exercise grounds the pathology in fundamental fluid dynamics by modeling an otoconium as a sphere settling in the endolymph.

            "problem": "An otoconial fragment implicated in Benign Paroxysmal Positional Vertigo (BPPV) can be idealized as a rigid sphere of radius $r$ suspended in endolymph within a semicircular canal. Assume the fragment has density $\\rho_{p}$ and endolymph has density $\\rho_{e}$, with density difference $\\Delta \\rho = \\rho_{p} - \\rho_{e}$. In a head orientation that aligns gravitational force along the canal segment, the particle settles under gravity and buoyancy while experiencing viscous drag from the surrounding fluid. In the creeping-flow regime for a sphere, the drag force is given by Stokes’ law. Starting from the fundamental expressions for buoyant-corrected weight of a sphere and Stokes’ drag on a sphere in creeping flow, derive the terminal settling velocity $v$ for the otoconial particle in terms of $\\Delta \\rho$, $g$, $r$, and the dynamic viscosity $\\mu$. Then, using the values $\\Delta \\rho = 1700\\,\\mathrm{kg/m^3}$, $g = 9.81\\,\\mathrm{m/s^2}$, $r = 15\\,\\mathrm{\\mu m}$, and $\\mu = 1.0\\,\\mathrm{mPa\\cdot s}$, compute the numerical value of $v$ and the Reynolds number $\\mathrm{Re}$ defined as $\\mathrm{Re} = \\rho_{e} v L / \\mu$ with characteristic length $L = 2r$ and endolymph density $\\rho_{e} = 1000\\,\\mathrm{kg/m^3}$. Express the terminal velocity in $\\mathrm{m/s}$ and the Reynolds number as a pure number. Round both quantities to three significant figures. Finally, briefly state whether the creeping-flow assumption is self-consistent based on the computed Reynolds number, but note that only the numerical results for $v$ and $\\mathrm{Re}$ will be graded.",

All parameters are provided and are physically reasonable.\n\nThe terminal settling velocity $v$ of the otoconial particle is achieved when the net force on the particle is zero. The forces acting on the particle are the gravitational force $F_g$, the buoyant force $F_b$, and the viscous drag force $F_d$. The force balance equation is:\n$$F_g = F_b + F_d$$\nThe otoconial particle is modeled as a sphere of radius $r$ and density $\\rho_p$. The volume of the sphere is $V = \\frac{4}{3}\\pi r^3$.\n\nThe gravitational force, acting downwards, is the mass of the particle times the gravitational acceleration $g$:\n$$F_g = m g = \\rho_p V g = \\rho_p \\left(\\frac{4}{3}\\pi r^3\\right) g$$\n\nThe buoyant force, acting upwards, is equal to the weight of the displaced endolymph fluid. The endolymph has density $\\rho_e$:\n$$F_b = \\rho_e V g = \\rho_e \\left(\\frac{4}{3}\\pi r^3\\right) g$$\n\nThe viscous drag force, acting upwards to oppose the settling motion, is given by Stokes' law for a sphere in a creeping flow (low Reynolds number flow). The dynamic viscosity of the fluid is $\\mu$ and the particle's velocity is $v$:\n$$F_d = 6 \\pi \\mu r v$$\n\nSubstituting these expressions into the force balance equation:\n$$\\rho_p \\left(\\frac{4}{3}\\pi r^3\\right) g = \\rho_e \\left(\\frac{4}{3}\\pi r^3\\right) g + 6 \\pi \\mu r v$$\n\nTo derive the terminal velocity $v$, we first isolate the drag force term:\n$$6 \\pi \\mu r v = \\rho_p \\left(\\frac{4}{3}\\pi r^3\\right) g - \\rho_e \\left(\\frac{4}{3}\\pi r^3\\right) g$$\nFactoring out common terms on the right-hand side gives:\n$$6 \\pi \\mu r v = (\\rho_p - \\rho_e) \\left(\\frac{4}{3}\\pi r^3\\right) g$$\nUsing the given definition of the density difference, $\\Delta \\rho = \\rho_p - \\rho_e$:\n$$6 \\pi \\mu r v = \\Delta \\rho \\left(\\frac{4}{3}\\pi r^3\\right) g$$\nNow, we solve for $v$:\n$$v = \\frac{\\Delta \\rho \\left(\\frac{4}{3}\\pi r^3\\right) g}{6 \\pi \\mu r}$$\nSimplifying the expression by canceling $\\pi$ and one factor of $r$, and simplifying the numerical constants ($\\frac{4/3}{6} = \\frac{4}{18} = \\frac{2}{9}$):\n$$v = \\frac{2 \\Delta \\rho g r^2}{9 \\mu}$$\nThis is the symbolic expression for the terminal settling velocity.\n\nNext, we compute the numerical value of $v$ using the given values.

            "problem": "In Benign Paroxysmal Positional Vertigo (BPPV), displaced otoconia move within a semicircular canal filled with endolymph, inducing aberrant cupular deflection. Consider a single otoconium idealized as a rigid sphere of radius $r$ and mass $m$ immersed in an incompressible Newtonian fluid (endolymph) of dynamic viscosity $\\mu$ and density $\\rho_{e}$. Let the otoconium density be $\\rho_{o}$ and its volume be $V$. Assume low Reynolds number (creeping flow), so that inertial effects of the surrounding fluid are negligible, and that the local canal segment can be approximated as a straight segment inclined at a fixed angle $\\theta$ (in radians) relative to the horizontal.

The request for derivation and solution constitutes a well-posed initial value problem in physics. There are no scientific inconsistencies, ambiguities, or subjective elements.\n\n### Step 2: Derivation of the Governing Equation\n\nWe apply Newton's second law along the tangential direction of the canal, which we denote by a coordinate axis where the positive direction is downslope. The equation of motion is:\n$$m \\frac{dv}{dt} = \\sum F_{\\text{tangential}}$$\nwhere $m$ is the mass of the otoconium and $v(t)$ is its tangential velocity. The forces acting on the otoconium along this axis are:\n\n1.  **Gravitational Force Component ($F_g$):** The gravitational force on the otoconium is $mg$, acting vertically downward. Its component along the downslope direction is $F_g = mg \\sin(\\theta)$.\n\n2.  **Buoyant Force Component ($F_b$):** By Archimedes' principle, the buoyant force is equal to the weight of the displaced endolymph, with magnitude $\\rho_e V g$, acting vertically upward. Its component along the tangential axis is directed upslope, hence it is negative: $F_b = -\\rho_e V g \\sin(\\theta)$.\n\n3.  **Stokes Drag Force ($F_d$):** Given the assumption of low Reynolds number (creeping flow), the viscous drag force on the spherical otoconium is given by Stokes' law, $F_d = -6 \\pi \\mu r v(t)$. The negative sign indicates that the force opposes the direction of motion.\n\nSumming these forces yields the total tangential force:\n$$\\sum F_{\\text{tangential}} = mg \\sin(\\theta) - \\rho_e V g \\sin(\\theta) - 6 \\pi \\mu r v(t)$$\nThe mass of the otoconium is related to its density and volume by $m = \\rho_o V$.

The solution $v(t)$ is the sum of a homogeneous solution, $v_h(t)$, and a particular solution, $v_p(t)$.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is:\n$$m \\frac{dv_h}{dt} + 6 \\pi \\mu r v_h = 0$$\nThe solution is of the form $v_h(t) = C \\exp(-t/\\tau)$, where $C$ is a constant of integration and $\\tau$ is the characteristic time constant. Substituting this form into the homogeneous equation gives:\n$$- \\frac{m}{\\tau} C \\exp(-t/\\tau) + 6 \\pi \\mu r C \\exp(-t/\\tau) = 0$$\n$$\\implies \\tau = \\frac{m}{6 \\pi \\mu r}$$\nSo, $v_h(t) = C \\exp\\left(-\\frac{6 \\pi \\mu r}{m} t\\right)$.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the forcing term $\\Delta \\rho V g \\sin(\\theta)$ is constant, we can assume a constant particular solution $v_p(t) = v_{\\infty}$, which corresponds to the terminal velocity. In this case, $\\frac{dv_p}{dt} = 0$. Substituting this into the full ODE:\n$$0 + 6 \\pi \\mu r v_{\\infty} = \\Delta \\rho V g \\sin(\\theta)$$\nSolving for the terminal velocity $v_{\\infty}$:\n$$v_{\\infty} = \\frac{\\Delta \\rho V g \\sin(\\theta)}{6 \\pi \\mu r}$$\nThe general solution is $v(t) = v_h(t) + v_p(t)$:\n$$v(t) = C \\exp\\left(-\\frac{6 \\pi \\mu r}{m} t\\right) + \\frac{\\Delta \\rho V g \\sin(\\theta)}{6 \\pi \\mu r}$$\nWe now apply the initial condition $v(0)=0$:\n$$v(0) = C \\exp(0) + v_{\\infty} = C + v_{\\infty} = 0$$\nThis yields $C = -v_{\\infty}$.\n\nSubstituting the value of $C$ back into the general solution gives the final expression for $v(t)$:\n$$v(t) = v_{\\infty} - v_{\\infty} \\exp(-t/\\tau) = v_{\\infty} \\left(1 - \\exp(-t/\\tau)\\right)$$\nFinally, substituting the full expressions for $v_{\\infty}$ and $\\tau$:\n$$v(t) = \\frac{\\Delta \\rho V g \\sin(\\theta)}{6 \\pi \\mu r} \\left(1 - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{6 \\pi \\mu r}{m} t\\right)\\right)$$\nThis expression represents the velocity of the otoconium as a function of time, starting from rest and asymptotically approaching the terminal velocity $v_{\\infty}$.

Let slow-phase velocity (SPV) denote the magnitude of the nystagmus slow-phase eye velocity.
