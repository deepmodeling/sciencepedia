Suppose a production run has been tuned such that the average integrations per cell is $\\lambda=2$ at harvest. Assume that each cell’s VCN, denoted by the random variable $K$, follows a Poisson distribution with mean $\\lambda$.\n\nStarting from the definition of the Poisson distribution as the counting distribution for independent rare events with rate $\\lambda$, write down the probability mass function for $K$ in terms of $\\lambda$ and an integer copy number $k \\ge 0$.

Modeling viral vector integration events, which are independent and occur at a constant average rate, using a Poisson distribution is a standard and well-established method in molecular biology, virology, and biomedical engineering. The specified mean vector copy number of $\\lambda=2$ is a realistic and clinically relevant value for CAR-T cell products. The problem is based on fundamental principles of probability theory applied to a real-world scientific context.\n- **Well-Posed**: The problem is well-posed.

All information required for a unique and meaningful solution is present.\n- **Objective**: The problem is expressed in precise, objective language, free from ambiguity or subjective claims.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid as it is scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and self-contained. A solution will be derived.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe problem asks for two parts: first, to state the probability mass function (PMF) of the Poisson distribution, and second, to use it to calculate a specific probability.\n\nLet $K$ be a random variable representing the vector copy number per cell. We are given that $K$ follows a Poisson distribution with a mean (or rate parameter) of $\\lambda$. The Poisson distribution models the probability of a given number of events occurring in a fixed interval of time or space if these events occur with a known constant mean rate and independently of the time since the last event.\n\nThe probability mass function (PMF) for a Poisson-distributed random variable $K$ is defined as:\n$$\n\\mathbb{P}(K=k) = \\frac{\\lambda^k \\exp(-\\lambda)}{k!}\n$$\nwhere $k$ is the number of occurrences (here, the integer copy number), which can be any non-negative integer ($k \\in \\{0, 1, 2, ...\\}$), $\\lambda$ is the average number of occurrences, and $e$ is the base of the natural logarithm.\n\nNext, we must compute the fraction of cells with more than $3$ vector copies, which is the probability $\\mathbb{P}(K>3)$, given that the average is $\\lambda=2$.\n\nThe event $K>3$ corresponds to the cell having $4$, $5$, $6$, or more vector copies. Calculating this directly would require summing an infinite series:\n$$\n\\mathbb{P}(K>3) = \\sum_{k=4}^{\\infty} \\mathbb{P}(K=k) = \\sum_{k=4}^{\\infty} \\frac{2^k \\exp(-2)}{k!}\n$$\nA more computationally efficient method is to use the complement rule. The total probability is $1$. Therefore, the probability of $K$ being greater than $3$ is $1$ minus the probability of $K$ being less than or equal to $3$.\n$$\n\\mathbb{P}(K>3) = 1 - \\mathbb{P}(K \\le 3)\n$$\nThe term $\\mathbb{P}(K \\le 3)$ is the cumulative probability of having $0$, $1$, $2$, or $3$ copies:\n$$\n\\mathbb{P}(K \\le 3) = \\mathbb{P}(K=0) + \\mathbb{P}(K=1) + \\mathbb{P}(K=2) + \\mathbb{P}(K=3)\n$$\nUsing the PMF with $\\lambda=2$, we can calculate each term:\n$$\n\\mathbb{P}(K \\le 3) = \\frac{2^0 \\exp(-2)}{0!} + \\frac{2^1 \\exp(-2)}{1!} + \\frac{2^2 \\exp(-2)}{2!} + \\frac{2^3 \\exp(-2)}{3!}\n$$\nWe can factor out the common term $\\exp(-2)$:\n$$\n\\mathbb{P}(K \\le 3) = \\exp(-2) \\left( \\frac{2^0}{0!} + \\frac{2^1}{1!} + \\frac{2^2}{2!} + \\frac{2^3}{3!} \\right)\n$$\nNow, we evaluate the terms inside the parentheses.

            "solution": "The problem statement has been rigorously validated and found to be scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. It contains a self-contained and internally consistent set of parameters and conditions, allowing for a unique and meaningful solution. The problem is based on fundamental principles of physics and cell biology, specifically the definition of number density and the conservation of matter (in this case, cells) over a short time interval where biological processes like proliferation and apoptosis are negligible. The parameters provided are plausible within the context of neuro-oncological therapies. Therefore, the problem is deemed valid and a formal solution will be derived.\n\nThe objective is to determine the total number of Chimeric Antigen Receptor T cells (CAR-T), denoted as $N_{infused}$, that must be infused to achieve a specified target state.\n\nFirst, let us define the given parameters and variables:\n- The target retained local CAR-T number density is $C_{target} = 1.0 \\times 10^{6}\\,\\mathrm{cells}/\\mathrm{mL}$.\n- The volume of the lesion is $V_{lesion} = 2.0\\,\\mathrm{mL}$.\n- The fraction of infused cells lost due to pressure-driven outflow is $f_{loss} = 40\\% = 0.40$.\n- The fraction of infused cells retained locally is $f_{retained} = 100\\% - f_{loss} = 100\\% - 40\\% = 60\\% = 0.60$.\n- Let $N_{retained}$ be the total number of cells that must be retained within the lesion to achieve the target density.\n- Let $N_{infused}$ be the total number of cells that must be initially infused.\n\nThe first step is to calculate the required number of cells, $N_{retained}$, that must be present in the lesion volume to meet the target number density. The definition of number density ($C$) is the number of particles ($N$) per unit volume ($V$), given by the relation:\n$$C = \\frac{N}{V}$$\nWe can rearrange this equation to solve for the number of cells:\n$$N = C \\times V$$\nApplying this to our specific problem, the number of retained cells is:\n$$N_{retained} = C_{target} \\times V_{lesion}$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$N_{retained} = (1.0 \\times 10^{6}\\,\\mathrm{cells}/\\mathrm{mL}) \\times (2.0\\,\\mathrm{mL})$$\n$$N_{retained} = 2.0 \\times 10^{6}\\,\\mathrm{cells}$$\nThis is the absolute number of CAR-T cells that must remain in the tumor after the initial post-infusion loss.\n\nThe second step is to relate this required retained cell number to the total number of cells that must be infused. The problem states that a fraction $f_{retained}$ of the total infused cells, $N_{infused}$, is retained locally. This relationship is based on the principle of cell number conservation immediately after infusion and is expressed as:\n$$N_{retained} = f_{retained} \\times N_{infused}$$\nOur goal is to find $N_{infused}$. We can rearrange the equation to solve for it:\n$$N_{infused} = \\frac{N_{retained}}{f_{retained}}$$\nNow, we substitute the values for $N_{retained}$ and $f_{retained}$:\n$$N_{infused} = \\frac{2.0 \\times 10^{6}\\,\\mathrm{cells}}{0.60}$$\nPerforming the calculation:\n$$N_{infused} = \\frac{2.0}{0.6} \\times 10^{6}\\,\\mathrm{cells}$$\n$$N_{infused} = \\frac{20}{6} \\times 10^{6}\\,\\mathrm{cells}$$\n$$N_{infused} = \\frac{10}{3} \\times 10^{6}\\,\\mathrm{cells}$$\n$$N_{infused} = 3.3333... \\times 10^{6}\\,\\mathrm{cells}$$\nThe problem requires the final answer to be rounded to four significant figures.
