To appreciate this timescale quantitatively, this first exercise models the body's B₁₂ store as a single compartment and uses a simple mass-balance equation to calculate the time to complete depletion after absorption ceases.

            "problem": "A patient with autoimmune gastritis has loss of intrinsic factor and ceases to absorb cobalamin (vitamin B$_{12}$), leading to eventual demyelination in the dorsal columns and lateral corticospinal tracts characteristic of subacute combined degeneration. Model the whole-body cobalamin store as a single compartment with content $S(t)$ (in micrograms) that is subject to a daily metabolic utilization $u$ (in micrograms per day) to sustain methylation-dependent myelin maintenance and erythropoiesis. Assume zero gastrointestinal absorption, time-invariant $u$, and that $S(t)$ is depleted solely by utilization with no other inputs or outputs. Starting from conservation of mass for the compartment, derive the depletion time to $S(t)=0$ and then compute the numerical value for a patient whose initial store is $S_0 = 3.8$ mg and daily utilization is $u = 2.3 \\, \\mu\\text{g/day}$. Express the final time in years, using $1$ year $=$ $365$ days, and round your answer to four significant figures.",
            "solution": "The problem statement is evaluated for validity before proceeding to a solution.\n\n### Step 1: Extract Givens\n- System: Whole-body cobalamin (vitamin B$_{12}$) store, modeled as a single compartment.\n- Variable: $S(t)$ is the cobalamin content in micrograms ($\\mu$g) at time $t$.\n- Initial Condition: Initial store is $S_0 = 3.8$ mg.\n- Process: The store is depleted by a daily metabolic utilization, $u$.\n- Parameter: $u = 2.3$ $\\mu$g/day, and is time-invariant.\n- Assumptions:\n    - Gastrointestinal absorption is zero.\n    - Depletion is solely by utilization (no other inputs or outputs).\n- Objective:\n    1. Derive the depletion time to $S(t) = 0$.\n    2. Compute the numerical value of this time for the given parameters.\n- Required Output Format:\n    - Express the final time in years.\n    - Use the conversion $1$ year $= 365$ days.\n    - Round the final answer to four significant figures.\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\n- **Scientifically Grounded**: The problem is scientifically sound. The described pathophysiology—autoimmune gastritis leading to intrinsic factor loss, vitamin B$_{12}$ malabsorption, and subsequent neurological damage (subacute combined degeneration)—is a well-established medical principle. The model of a single compartment with constant-rate depletion is a standard and appropriate simplification for this type of physiological kinetics problem. The given values for initial body stores ($S_0 = 3.8$ mg) and daily utilization ($u = 2.3$ $\\mu$g/day) are within physiologically realistic ranges (typical stores are $2-5$ mg, daily needs are $2-3$ $\\mu$g).\n- **Well-Posed**: The problem is well-posed. It provides all necessary information (initial condition, rate of change, and a clear objective) to determine a unique solution.\n- **Objective**: The problem is stated in precise, objective language, free of ambiguity or subjective claims.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is **valid** as it is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. A solution will be derived.\n\n### Derivation and Solution\nThe problem is governed by the principle of conservation of mass for the cobalamin store, $S(t)$. The rate of change of the store, $\\frac{dS}{dt}$, is the rate of input minus the rate of output.\n\nAccording to the problem statement, there is zero gastrointestinal absorption, so the input rate is $0$. The output is the constant daily metabolic utilization, $u$. Therefore, the governing ordinary differential equation is:\n$$\n\\frac{dS}{dt} = 0 - u = -u\n$$\nThis is a first-order linear differential equation. To find the amount of cobalamin $S(t)$ at any time $t$, we integrate this equation with respect to time from the initial time $t=0$ to a general time $t$. The initial condition is $S(0) = S_0$.\n$$\n\\int_{S(0)}^{S(t)} dS' = \\int_{0}^{t} (-u) \\, dt'\n$$\nSince $u$ is a constant, it can be moved outside the integral:\n$$\nS' \\bigg|_{S_0}^{S(t)} = -u \\cdot t' \\bigg|_{0}^{t}\n$$\n$$\nS(t) - S_0 = -u(t - 0)\n$$\nThis yields the equation for the cobalamin store as a function of time:\n$$\nS(t) = S_0 - ut\n$$\nThis linear decay model is expected for a constant rate of depletion. The depletion time, which we will denote as $T$, is the time at which the store is fully exhausted, meaning $S(T) = 0$. We set $S(t)=0$ at $t=T$:\n$$\n0 = S_0 - uT\n$$\nSolving for the depletion time $T$:\n$$\nuT = S_0\n$$\n$$\nT = \\frac{S_0}{u}\n$$\nThis is the symbolic expression for the depletion time. We now proceed to compute its numerical value using the provided data.\n\nThe given values are:\n- Initial store, $S_0 = 3.8$ mg\n- Daily utilization, $u = 2.3$ $\\mu$g/day\n\nFor the units to be consistent in the expression $T = \\frac{S_0}{u}$, we must express $S_0$ and $u$ in a common unit of mass. We will convert milligrams (mg) to micrograms ($\\mu$g).\nUsing the conversion $1$ mg $= 1000$ $\\mu$g, or $1$ mg $= 10^3$ $\\mu$g:\n$$\nS_0 = 3.8 \\, \\text{mg} = 3.8 \\times 10^3 \\, \\mu\\text{g} = 3800 \\, \\mu\\text{g}\n$$\nNow, we can calculate the depletion time $T$ in days:\n$$\nT_{\\text{days}} = \\frac{S_0}{u} = \\frac{3800 \\, \\mu\\text{g}}{2.3 \\, \\mu\\text{g/day}} = \\frac{3800}{2.3} \\, \\text{days}\n$$\n$$\nT_{\\text{days}} \\approx 1652.1739... \\, \\text{days}\n$$\nThe problem requires the answer in years, using the conversion $1$ year $= 365$ days.\n$$\nT_{\\text{years}} = \\frac{T_{\\text{days}}}{365} = \\frac{3800}{2.3 \\times 365} \\, \\text{years}\n$$\nWe compute the numerical value:\n$$\nT_{\\text{years}} = \\frac{3800}{839.5} \\, \\text{years} \\approx 4.52650387... \\, \\text{years}\n$$\nFinally, we round the answer to four significant figures, as requested. The fifth significant figure is $5$, so we round up the fourth digit.\n$$\nT_{\\text{years}} \\approx 4.527 \\, \\text{years}\n$$\nThis represents the time it would take for a patient with total cessation of vitamin B$_{12}$ absorption to deplete their body stores from a normal level to zero, at which point severe neurological and hematological signs would be expected to be well-established.",

            "solution": "The problem is validated as scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and complete. It is a direct application of Bayes' theorem to a realistic clinical scenario in diagnostic medicine.\n\nThe goal is to compute the post-test probability of a patient having pernicious anemia given a positive test result. We begin by formally defining the events and stating the given probabilities based on the problem statement.\n\nLet $A$ be the event that the patient has autoimmune pernicious anemia.\nLet $A^c$ be the complementary event that the patient does not have pernicious anemia.\nLet $T^+$ be the event that the anti–intrinsic factor antibody assay returns a positive result.\nLet $T^-$ be the event that the assay returns a negative result.\n\nFrom the problem statement, we are given the following probabilities:\nThe pretest probability, or prior probability, of having pernicious anemia is $P(A) = 0.20$.\nThe probability of not having pernicious anemia is therefore $P(A^c) = 1 - P(A) = 1 - 0.20 = 0.80$.\nThe sensitivity of the assay is the probability of a positive test result given that the patient has the disease: $P(T^+ | A) = 0.50$. This is the true positive rate.\nThe specificity of the assay is the probability of a negative test result given that the patient does not have the disease: $P(T^- | A^c) = 0.99$. This is the true negative rate.\n\nWe are asked to find the post-test probability of having pernicious anemia given a positive test result, which is denoted as $P(A | T^+)$.\n\nWe start from the fundamental definition of conditional probability:\n$$P(A | T^+) = \\frac{P(A \\cap T^+)}{P(T^+)}$$\nThe term in the numerator, $P(A \\cap T^+)$, is the joint probability of having the disease and testing positive. It can be expressed using the definition of conditional probability as:\n$$P(A \\cap T^+) = P(T^+ | A) P(A)$$\nSubstituting this into the first equation, we obtain Bayes' theorem:\n$$P(A | T^+) = \\frac{P(T^+ | A) P(A)}{P(T^+)}$$\nThe denominator, $P(T^+)$, is the total probability of obtaining a positive test result. A positive result can occur in two mutually exclusive scenarios: a true positive (the patient has the disease and tests positive) or a false positive (the patient does not have the disease but tests positive). We can express $P(T^+)$ using the law of total probability:\n$$P(T^+) = P(T^+ \\cap A) + P(T^+ \\cap A^c)$$\nAgain, using the definition of conditional probability for each term:\n$$P(T^+) = P(T^+ | A) P(A) + P(T^+ | A^c) P(A^c)$$\nWe have all the terms for this expression except for $P(T^+ | A^c)$, which is the false positive rate. However, we can derive it from the specificity. For a patient who does not have the disease (condition $A^c$), the test can only be positive ($T^+$) or negative ($T^-$). Therefore, the probabilities of these two outcomes must sum to $1$:\n$$P(T^+ | A^c) + P(T^- | A^c) = 1$$\nWe are given the specificity, $P(T^- | A^c) = 0.99$. So, we can find the false positive rate:\n$$P(T^+ | A^c) = 1 - P(T^- | A^c) = 1 - 0.99 = 0.01$$\nNow we can calculate the total probability of a positive test, $P(T^+)$:\n$$P(T^+) = (P(T^+ | A) \\times P(A)) + (P(T^+ | A^c) \\times P(A^c))$$\n$$P(T^+) = (0.50 \\times 0.20) + (0.01 \\times 0.80)$$\n$$P(T^+) = 0.10 + 0.008 = 0.108$$\nFinally, we substitute all the known values back into Bayes' theorem to find the post-test probability $P(A | T^+)$:\n$$P(A | T^+) = \\frac{P(T^+ | A) P(A)}{P(T^+)}$$\n$$P(A | T^+) = \\frac{0.50 \\times 0.20}{0.108} = \\frac{0.10}{0.108}$$\n$$P(A | T^+) \\approx 0.9259259...$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures. The first four significant figures are $9$, $2$, $5$, and $9$. The fifth digit is $2$, so we do not round up.\n$$P(A | T^+) \\approx 0.9259$$",
