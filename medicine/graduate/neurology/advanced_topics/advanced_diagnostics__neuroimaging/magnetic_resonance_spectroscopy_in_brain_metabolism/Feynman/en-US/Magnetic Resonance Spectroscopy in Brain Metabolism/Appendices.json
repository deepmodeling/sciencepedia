It is scientifically sound, well-posed, objective, and contains all necessary information to arrive at a solution. I will proceed with the solution.\n\n---\n\n### Solution\nThe problem requires a three-part response: a conceptual definition, a mathematical derivation, and a numerical calculation related to proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy.\n\n#### 1) Physical Meaning of $T_1$ and $T_2$\n\nIn proton MRS, the signal arises from the net magnetization of a population of nuclear spins (specifically, hydrogen nuclei or protons) placed in a strong static magnetic field, $\\mathbf{B}_0$. The following definitions are rooted in the dynamics of this net magnetization vector, $\\mathbf{M}$.\n\n**Longitudinal Relaxation Time ($T_1$)**:\nThe longitudinal relaxation time, $T_1$, also known as the spin-lattice relaxation time, governs the rate at which the component of the net magnetization parallel to the main magnetic field, $\\mathbf{B}_0$ (defined as the $z$-axis, so $M_z$), returns to its thermal equilibrium value, $M_0$. After an RF pulse perturbs the system and reduces $M_z$, the spins exchange energy with their surrounding molecular environment (the \"lattice\") to re-establish thermal equilibrium. This energy exchange is most efficient when fluctuations in local magnetic fields, caused by molecular tumbling and translations, occur at or near the Larmor frequency. The process is described by an exponential recovery:\n$$M_z(t) = M_0 + (M_z(0) - M_0)\\exp\\left(-\\frac{t}{T_1}\\right)$$\nwhere $M_z(0)$ is the longitudinal magnetization immediately after the RF pulse. For small, mobile metabolites like N-acetylaspartate (NAA), creatine (Cr), and choline (Cho), which tumble rapidly in the aqueous intracellular environment, $T_1$ values are relatively long (typically on the order of $1-2\\,\\mathrm{s}$ at clinical field strengths). Their specific $T_1$ values are influenced by their size, shape, and interactions with larger, slower-moving structures like lipids and proteins, which modulate the spectral density of molecular motion.\n\n**Transverse Relaxation Time ($T_2$)**:\nThe transverse relaxation time, $T_2$, also known as the spin-spin relaxation time, governs the rate of decay of the component of the net magnetization in the plane perpendicular to $\\mathbf{B}_0$ (the transverse plane, so $M_{xy}$). After an RF pulse creates transverse magnetization, the individual nuclear spins begin to precess at slightly different frequencies due to local magnetic field variations caused by neighboring spins. This leads to a loss of phase coherence, and the net transverse magnetization vector dephases, decaying to zero. This process does not require energy exchange with the lattice. The decay is described by an exponential function:\n$$M_{xy}(t) = M_{xy}(0)\\exp\\left(-\\frac{t}{T_2}\\right)$$\nwhere $M_{xy}(0)$ is the transverse magnetization immediately after the pulse. $T_2$ is sensitive to a broad range of motional frequencies, especially slow motions. In the cellular environment, the $T_2$ of metabolites is influenced by the viscosity of the cytoplasm and binding interactions with macromolecules. More restricted motion or a more viscous environment leads to a shorter $T_2$. For small metabolites in the brain, $T_2$ values are typically a few hundred milliseconds. Note that the observed decay rate, characterized by $T_2^*$, is faster than the intrinsic $T_2$ decay due to additional dephasing from static magnetic field inhomogeneities. A spin-echo sequence is designed to refocus this $T_2^*$ dephasing, making the signal decay dependent on the true $T_2$.\n\n#### 2) Derivation of the Attenuation Factor $A$\n\nWe begin with the Bloch equations for the evolution of magnetization during the free precession periods between RF pulses. In the rotating frame of reference, and neglecting precession itself, the equations for the longitudinal ($M_z$) and transverse ($M_{xy}$) components are:\n$$ \\frac{dM_z}{dt} = \\frac{M_0 - M_z}{T_1} $$\n$$ \\frac{dM_{xy}}{dt} = -\\frac{M_{xy}}{T_2} $$\nThe problem describes a sequence of identical acquisitions repeated every $TR$ interval. We need to find the steady-state signal.\n\n**i. Longitudinal Magnetization Recovery:**\nLet $M_z^{ss-}$ be the steady-state longitudinal magnetization immediately before an RF pulse. An ideal $90^{\\circ}$ pulse rotates this magnetization entirely into the transverse plane. The longitudinal magnetization immediately after the pulse, at time $t=0^+$, is:\n$$ M_z(0^+) = M_z^{ss-} \\cos(90^{\\circ}) = 0 $$\nDuring the repetition time $TR$, this longitudinal magnetization recovers towards its equilibrium value $M_0$. The solution to the differential equation for $M_z$ with the initial condition $M_z(0^+) = 0$ is:\n$$ M_z(t) = M_0 (1 - \\exp(-t/T_1)) $$\nAt the end of the $TR$ period, just before the next pulse, the longitudinal magnetization will have recovered to:\n$$ M_z(TR) = M_0 (1 - \\exp(-TR/T_1)) $$\nThe assumption of perfect spoiling means that any residual transverse magnetization at the end of the $TR$ interval is destroyed. Thus, in the steady state, the magnetization right before a pulse must be equal to the magnetization that has recovered from the previous pulse. Therefore, we have found the steady-state longitudinal magnetization available for excitation:\n$$ M_z^{ss-} = M_0 \\left(1 - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{TR}{T_1}\\right)\\right) $$\n\n**ii. Transverse Magnetization Evolution and Signal:**\nThe ideal $90^{\\circ}$ pulse converts the available longitudinal magnetization $M_z^{ss-}$ into transverse magnetization. At $t=0^+$, the magnitude of the transverse magnetization is:\n$$ M_{xy}(0^+) = M_z^{ss-} \\sin(90^{\\circ}) = M_z^{ss-} $$\nThe problem states that the signal is acquired at the peak of a spin-echo at time $TE$ after excitation. A spin-echo sequence refocuses dephasing due to static field inhomogeneity, but the signal still decays due to intrinsic $T_2$ relaxation processes. The assumptions state we can neglect other effects like diffusion. Therefore, the transverse magnetization decays according to the $T_2$ relaxation equation over the full echo time $TE$:\n$$ M_{xy}(TE) = M_{xy}(0^+) \\exp\\left(-\\frac{TE}{T_2}\\right) $$\nSubstituting the expressions for $M_{xy}(0^+)$ and $M_z^{ss-}$ we found earlier:\n$$ M_{xy}(TE) = \\left[ M_0 \\left(1 - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{TR}{T_1}\\right)\\right) \\right] \\exp\\left(-\\frac{TE}{T_2}\\right) $$\n\n**iii. Attenuation Factor $A$:**\nThe ideal signal amplitude would be proportional to $M_0$, corresponding to full magnetization recovery ($TR \\rightarrow \\infty$) and no transverse decay ($TE \\rightarrow 0$). The attenuation factor $A$ is the ratio of the actual measured signal amplitude (proportional to $M_{xy}(TE)$) to the ideal amplitude (proportional to $M_0$).\n$$ A = \\frac{M_{xy}(TE)}{M_0} $$\n$$ A = \\left(1 - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{TR}{T_1}\\right)\\right) \\exp\\left(-\\frac{TE}{T_2}\\right) $$\nThis expression represents the combined attenuation due to incomplete longitudinal relaxation ($T_1$-weighting) and transverse relaxation ($T_2$-weighting).\n\n#### 3) Numerical Calculation\n\nWe use the derived formula for $A$ with the provided numerical values:\n- $T_1 = 1400\\,\\mathrm{ms}$\n- $T_2 = 300\\,\\mathrm{ms}$\n- $TR = 2000\\,\\mathrm{ms}$\n- $TE = 30\\,\\mathrm{ms}$\n\nThe attenuation factor $A$ is:\n$$ A = \\left(1 - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{TR}{T_1}\\right)\\right) \\exp\\left(-\\frac{TE}{T_2}\\right) $$\nFirst, we compute the dimensionless ratios in the exponents:\n$$ \\frac{TR}{T_1} = \\frac{2000}{1400} = \\frac{20}{14} = \\frac{10}{7} $$\n$$ \\frac{TE}{T_2} = \\frac{30}{300} = \\frac{1}{10} = 0.1 $$\nSubstitute these values into the expression for $A$:\n$$ A = \\left(1 - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{10}{7}\\right)\\right) \\exp(-0.1) $$\nNow, we evaluate the numerical values of the exponential terms:\n$$ \\exp\\left(-\\frac{10}{7}\\right) \\approx \\exp(-1.4285714) \\approx 0.239651 $$\n$$ \\exp(-0.1) \\approx 0.9048374 $$\nSubstituting these back into the equation for $A$:\n$$ A \\approx (1 - 0.239651) \\times 0.9048374 $$\n$$ A \\approx 0.760349 \\times 0.9048374 $$\n$$ A \\approx 0.688043 $$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures.\n$$ A \\approx 0.6880 $$\nThis value represents the fraction of the ideal maximum signal that is obtained with the specified $TR$ and $TE$.",

            "solution": "The problem requires the derivation of a scaling law for the Signal-to-Noise Ratio ($\\mathrm{SNR}$) in Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (MRS) based on a set of provided principles, and then to compute the ratio of SNRs for two specific acquisitions.\n\nFirst, we establish the general scaling law for $\\mathrm{SNR}$. The $\\mathrm{SNR}$ is defined as the ratio of the signal amplitude, which we denote as $S$, to the standard deviation of the baseline noise, which we denote as $\\sigma_{\\text{noise}}$.

The detected signal amplitude, $S$, scales with the equilibrium nuclear magnetization $M_0$, and $M_0$ scales linearly with the static magnetic field $B_0$. Therefore, the signal amplitude has a direct proportionality to the magnetic field strength:\n    $$ S \\propto B_0 $$\n\n2.  The signal amplitude $S$ also scales linearly with the number of resonant spins.

The given parameters are:\n- Slice thickness, $\\Delta z = 20\\,\\mathrm{mm}$\n- RF bandwidth, $\\mathrm{BW}_{\\mathrm{RF}} = 1200\\,\\mathrm{Hz}$\nUsing the derived formula:\n$$ |\\delta z| = \\frac{|\\Delta f| \\cdot \\Delta z}{\\mathrm{BW}_{\\mathrm{RF}}} = \\frac{(255.462\\,\\mathrm{Hz}) \\cdot (20\\,\\mathrm{mm})}{1200\\,\\mathrm{Hz}} $$\n$$ |\\delta z| = \\frac{5109.24\\,\\mathrm{mm \\cdot Hz}}{1200\\,\\mathrm{Hz}} = 4.2577\\,\\mathrm{mm} $$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures.\n$$ |\\delta z| \\approx 4.258\\,\\mathrm{mm} $$\nThis is the magnitude of the chemical-shift displacement for the specified metabolite resonance along the direction of the slice-select gradient.",
