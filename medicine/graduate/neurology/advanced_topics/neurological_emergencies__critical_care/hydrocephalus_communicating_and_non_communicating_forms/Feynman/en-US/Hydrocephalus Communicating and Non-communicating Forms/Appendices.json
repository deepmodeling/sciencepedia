            "problem": "A patient with progressive gait disturbance, urinary urgency, and cognitive slowing undergoes axial brain imaging by Computed Tomography (CT) and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). On an axial slice passing through the frontal horns of the lateral ventricles, you intend to quantify ventriculomegaly using a dimensionless linear index that compares the maximal span of the frontal horns to the maximal internal diameter of the calvarium on the same slice. In neuroimaging, this index is widely used to operationalize ventricular enlargement under the constraints of the Monro–Kellie doctrine (the intracranial space is effectively incompressible, so $V_{\\text{brain}} + V_{\\text{blood}} + V_{\\text{cerebrospinal fluid}}$ is approximately constant). The rationale for a dimensionless ratio is to obtain a scale-invariant measure of ventricular expansion that is robust to absolute magnification and pixel spacing differences when numerator and denominator are both measured along the same in-plane axis.\n\nYou are provided the following DICOM metadata and measurements for the single axial slice:\n- In-plane pixel spacing along the left–right axis is $s_{x} = 0.68\\ \\mathrm{mm/pixel}$ and along the anterior–posterior axis is $s_{y} = 0.72\\ \\mathrm{mm/pixel}$.\n- The maximal left–right distance between the frontal horns on this slice is measured as $98$ pixels between the inner margins.\n- The maximal internal left–right diameter of the skull on the same slice (inner table to inner table) is measured as $310$ pixels.\n\nAssume measurements are taken with calipers aligned strictly along the left–right axis of the image plane, the slice plane is not distorted by nonrigid effects, and the skull’s inner table is approximately orthogonal to the measurement axis in the region of interest. Using the definition of the Evans index, $EI$, as the ratio of frontal horn width to maximal internal skull diameter measured on the same axial slice,\n$$\nEI \\;=\\; \\frac{W_{\\text{FH}}}{D_{\\text{IS}}},\n$$\ncompute $EI$ for this slice. Express your answer as a dimensionless number rounded to three significant figures.\n\nSeparately, note that the patient’s MRI demonstrates periventricular T2 hyperintensities compatible with transependymal cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) flow and a patent aqueduct with elevated net forward CSF flow on phase-contrast MRI. While you are not asked to classify hydrocephalus here, you may use these facts to explain the mechanistic implications in your reasoning.\n\nRound your final numerical result to three significant figures. Provide the Evans index as a dimensionless quantity.",
            "solution": "The problem requires the calculation of the Evans index, $EI$, a dimensionless metric used in neuroimaging to quantify ventriculomegaly. The validation of the problem statement is the mandatory first step.\n\n### Step 1: Extract Givens\nThe data provided in the problem statement are:\n- In-plane pixel spacing along the left–right axis: $s_{x} = 0.68\\ \\mathrm{mm/pixel}$\n- In-plane pixel spacing along the anterior–posterior axis: $s_{y} = 0.72\\ \\mathrm{mm/pixel}$\n- Maximal left–right distance between the frontal horns in pixels: $N_{\\text{FH}} = 98\\ \\text{pixels}$\n- Maximal internal left–right diameter of the skull in pixels: $N_{\\text{IS}} = 310\\ \\text{pixels}$\n- Definition of the Evans index: $EI = \\frac{W_{\\text{FH}}}{D_{\\text{IS}}}$, where $W_{\\text{FH}}$ is the maximal span of the frontal horns and $D_{\\text{IS}}$ is the maximal internal diameter of the calvarium on the same axial slice.\n- Measurements are stated to be taken along the left–right axis of the image plane.\n- The final result must be rounded to three significant figures.\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\nThe problem is subjected to rigorous validation.\n- **Scientifically Grounded**: The problem is based on established principles of neurology and medical imaging. The Evans index is a standard, widely used clinical measurement for evaluating ventricular size. The Monro-Kellie doctrine is a fundamental concept in neurophysiology. The clinical and imaging findings described are classic for Normal Pressure Hydrocephalus (NPH), a real medical condition. The problem is scientifically and factually sound.\n- **Well-Posed**: The problem provides a clear definition for the quantity to be calculated ($EI$) and supplies all necessary numerical data ($N_{\\text{FH}}$ and $N_{\\text{IS}}$). The request is for a single numerical value, and the data are sufficient to compute it uniquely.\n- **Objective**: The problem uses precise, quantitative language and avoids any subjective or opinion-based statements.\n- **Completeness and Consistency**: The problem is self-contained. The provided pixel dimensions, $s_x$ and $s_y$, may initially seem like they require careful handling. However, since the Evans index is a ratio of two lengths measured along the same axis (left-right), the scaling factor ($s_x$) is expected to cancel. The inclusion of $s_y$ is extraneous to the calculation but does not create a contradiction; it serves to test whether the solver understands the dimensionless nature of the index. The data are consistent and sufficient.\n- **Realism**: The values for pixel spacing and the resulting Evans index (which will be $>0.3$) are entirely realistic for a clinical scenario of suspected NPH.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is deemed **valid**. It is scientifically sound, well-posed, objective, and internally consistent. The solution will now be derived.\n\nThe Evans index, $EI$, is defined as the ratio of the maximal width of the frontal horns of the lateral ventricles, $W_{\\text{FH}}$, to the maximal internal diameter of the calvarium, $D_{\\text{IS}}$.\n$$\nEI = \\frac{W_{\\text{FH}}}{D_{\\text{IS}}}\n$$\nThe problem states that both measurements are taken along the left-right axis of the image. The physical distances can be calculated from the given pixel counts and the corresponding pixel spacing, $s_x$.\n\nThe physical width of the frontal horns is the product of the pixel count and the pixel spacing along that axis:\n$$\nW_{\\text{FH}} = N_{\\text{FH}} \\times s_x\n$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$\nW_{\\text{FH}} = 98\\ \\text{pixels} \\times 0.68\\ \\mathrm{mm/pixel} = 66.64\\ \\mathrm{mm}\n$$\nSimilarly, the physical internal diameter of the skull is:\n$$\nD_{\\text{IS}} = N_{\\text{IS}} \\times s_x\n$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$\nD_{\\text{IS}} = 310\\ \\text{pixels} \\times 0.68\\ \\mathrm{mm/pixel} = 210.8\\ \\mathrm{mm}\n$$\nNow, we compute the Evans index using these physical distances:\n$$\nEI = \\frac{66.64\\ \\mathrm{mm}}{210.8\\ \\mathrm{mm}}\n$$\nAlternatively, and more elegantly, we can substitute the symbolic expressions for $W_{\\text{FH}}$ and $D_{\\text{IS}}$ directly into the definition of the Evans index. This demonstrates the scale-invariant property of the ratio as mentioned in the problem statement.\n$$\nEI = \\frac{N_{\\text{FH}} \\times s_x}{N_{\\text{IS}} \\times s_x}\n$$\nSince $s_x$ is a non-zero constant present in both the numerator and the denominator, it cancels out:\n$$\nEI = \\frac{N_{\\text{FH}}}{N_{\\text{IS}}}\n$$\nThis confirms that the Evans index can be calculated directly from the ratio of the pixel measurements, provided they are made along the same axis. The specific values of the pixel spacing, $s_x$ and $s_y$, are not required for the calculation of the index itself. The value for $s_y$ is entirely irrelevant to this specific task.\n\nSubstituting the given pixel counts:\n$$\nEI = \\frac{98}{310}\n$$\nPerforming the division gives:\n$$\nEI \\approx 0.31612903...\n$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to three significant figures. The first three significant figures are $3$, $1$, and $6$. The fourth significant figure is $1$, which is less than $5$, so we round down (i.e., we truncate).\n$$\nEI \\approx 0.316\n$$\nClinically, an Evans index value greater than $0.30$ is the standard radiological criterion for ventriculomegaly, often in the context of suspected NPH. The calculated value of $0.316$ is consistent with this diagnosis. The additional information provided (patent aqueduct) indicates that this is a *communicating* hydrocephalus, as there is no obstruction to cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) flow between the ventricular system and the subarachnoid space. The transependymal flow of CSF is a consequence of elevated intraventricular pressure, which, according to the Monro-Kellie doctrine ($V_{\\text{brain}} + V_{\\text{blood}} + V_{\\text{CSF}} = \\text{constant}$), forces ventricular expansion at the expense of the brain parenchyma, leading to the patient's neurological symptoms.",

            "problem": "A neuroradiology fellow is asked to decide which patient’s imaging most strongly supports a diagnosis of communicating hydrocephalus in the form of idiopathic Normal Pressure Hydrocephalus (NPH), as opposed to ex vacuo ventriculomegaly or non-communicating (obstructive) hydrocephalus. The fellow must reason from core principles of Cerebrospinal Fluid (CSF) dynamics and the Monro–Kellie doctrine, plus precise measurement of the callosal angle on coronal Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI).\n\nFundamental base to use:\n- CSF is produced in the choroid plexus within the lateral ventricles, flows through the foramen of Monro into the third ventricle, through the cerebral aqueduct into the fourth ventricle, and then exits into the subarachnoid space via the foramen of Magendie and Luschka, finally being absorbed by arachnoid granulations into the venous system. Communicating hydrocephalus arises from impaired CSF absorption with patent ventricular pathways; non-communicating hydrocephalus arises from obstruction within the ventricular system.\n- The Monro–Kellie doctrine states the intracranial volume is constrained such that the sum of brain parenchyma, blood, and CSF volumes remains approximately constant.\n- On coronal MRI acquired perpendicular to the Anterior Commissure–Posterior Commissure (AC–PC) line and passing through the posterior commissure, the callosal angle is measured between the medial walls of the lateral ventricles at the level of the body of the corpus callosum. In idiopathic NPH, disproportionately enlarged subarachnoid-space hydrocephalus (DESH) manifests with tight high-convexity sulci and enlarged Sylvian fissures, leading to medialization and parallel orientation of the ventricular walls and a reduced callosal angle, typically less than $90^\\circ$. In ex vacuo ventriculomegaly due to cortical atrophy, there is widening of the interhemispheric fissure and sulcal expansion, yielding a larger callosal angle, often greater than $100^\\circ$.\n\nFour patients undergo MRI with standardized coronal imaging at the posterior commissure level, and the callosal angle is measured. Additional features are provided to ensure scientific realism and to test integration of the base principles:\n\n- A: A patient aged $72$ years with gait apraxia, urinary urgency, and cognitive slowing. MRI shows Evans Index (EI) of $0.35$, tight high-convexity sulci, enlarged Sylvian fissures, periventricular hyperintensities consistent with transependymal CSF flow, patent aqueduct with prominent flow void on $T_2$ imaging, and a callosal angle of $68^\\circ$.\n- B: A patient aged $75$ years with progressive cortical atrophy and temporoparietal volume loss. MRI shows EI of $0.32$, proportionate sulcal enlargement including widened interhemispheric fissure, preserved aqueductal flow void, and a callosal angle of $125^\\circ$.\n- C: A patient aged $45$ years with an intraventricular mass at the level of the cerebral aqueduct; the third ventricle is disproportionately enlarged relative to the fourth ventricle. MRI shows EI of $0.33$, absent aqueductal flow void, transependymal edema, and a callosal angle of $74^\\circ$.\n- D: A patient aged $68$ years three months after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage.

            "solution": "The problem requires the identification of the patient case most consistent with communicating hydrocephalus, specifically in the form of idiopathic Normal Pressure Hydrocephalus (NPH). This diagnosis must be made by applying stated principles of Cerebrospinal Fluid (CSF) dynamics and interpreting key Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) findings, with a particular focus on the callosal angle.\n\nFirst, let us summarize the defining characteristics of the relevant neurological conditions as provided in the problem statement.\n1.  **Communicating Hydrocephalus (Idiopathic NPH type):** This condition results from impaired CSF absorption by the arachnoid granulations, while the ventricular pathways remain patent. The consequent accumulation of CSF leads to ventriculomegaly. The specific radiological pattern for idiopathic NPH is known as Disproportionately Enlarged Subarachnoid-space Hydrocephalus (DESH), characterized by ventriculomegaly with tight high-convexity sulci and enlarged Sylvian fissures. This pattern of pressure from the superior and medial aspects of the cerebral hemispheres causes medialization of the lateral ventricles, resulting in an acute callosal angle, defined as typically less than $90^\\circ$. Clinically, it often presents with gait apraxia, cognitive slowing, and urinary urgency.\n2.  **Ex Vacuo Ventriculomegaly:** This is not a true hydrocephalus but rather a passive enlargement of the ventricles to fill the space created by the loss of brain parenchyma (cortical atrophy). In this case, there is generalized, proportionate enlargement of all CSF spaces, including the sulci and the interhemispheric fissure. The widening of the interhemispheric fissure prevents medialization of the lateral ventricles, leading to an obtuse callosal angle, often greater than $100^\\circ$.\n3.  **Non-communicating (Obstructive) Hydrocephalus:** This is caused by a physical blockage within the ventricular system (e.g., at the cerebral aqueduct). CSF flow is impeded, causing a pressure buildup and dilation of the ventricles located upstream (proximal) to the obstruction. CSF flow signals (flow voids) will be absent at and beyond the point of obstruction.\n\nNow, we will analyze each patient's case based on these principles.\n\n**Option A: Patient A**\n- **Clinical Presentation:** The patient, aged $72$ years, presents with a classic triad of symptoms: gait apraxia, urinary urgency, and cognitive slowing. This is highly suggestive of NPH.\n- **MRI Findings:**\n    - Evans Index (EI) of $0.35$: An EI greater than $0.3$ confirms ventriculomegaly.\n    - `tight high-convexity sulci, enlarged Sylvian fissures`: This is the explicit definition of the DESH pattern, a key radiological marker for idiopathic NPH.\n    - `periventricular hyperintensities consistent with transependymal CSF flow`: This indicates active, high-pressure hydrocephalus where CSF is forced through the ependymal lining into the surrounding white matter.\n    - `patent aqueduct with prominent flow void on T2 imaging`: This finding is crucial as it confirms that the ventricular system is not obstructed at the aqueduct level, thus establishing the condition as a *communicating* hydrocephalus.\n    - `callosal angle of 68^\\circ`: This angle is acute (less than $90^\\circ$), which is the expected measurement in idiopathic NPH due to the superior-medial pressure causing the walls of the lateral ventricles to become more parallel.\n- **Verdict:** All features—clinical, general imaging, and specific quantitative measurement—are perfectly concordant with the diagnosis of communicating hydrocephalus in the form of idiopathic NPH. **Correct**.\n\n**Option B: Patient B**\n- **Clinical Presentation:** The patient, aged $75$ years, has a background of progressive cortical atrophy and volume loss, suggesting a primary neurodegenerative process.\n- **MRI Findings:**\n    - EI of $0.32$: Confirms ventriculomegaly.\n    - `proportionate sulcal enlargement including widened interhemispheric fissure`: This finding is the direct opposite of the DESH pattern. It indicates that the ventriculomegaly is a passive consequence of brain tissue loss.\n    - `preserved aqueductal flow void`: Rules out an obstruction.\n    - `callosal angle of 125^\\circ`: This angle is obtuse (greater than $100^\\circ$), consistent with the lateral ventricles being held apart by the atrophic, widened interhemispheric fissure.\n- **Verdict:** The combination of generalized atrophy and a wide callosal angle is the classic presentation of ex vacuo ventriculomegaly. This is not NPH. **Incorrect**.\n\n**Option C: Patient C**\n- **Clinical Presentation:** The patient, aged $45$ years, has an intraventricular mass at a critical chokepoint for CSF flow.\n- **MRI Findings:**\n    - `intraventricular mass at the level of the cerebral aqueduct`: This is a direct cause for an obstruction.\n    - `the third ventricle is disproportionately enlarged relative to the fourth ventricle`: This is the pathognomonic sign of an obstruction at the cerebral aqueduct. The ventricles proximal to the block (lateral and third) are dilated, while the ventricle distal to it (fourth) is not.\n    - `absent aqueductal flow void`: This confirms the functional significance of the mass, i.e., it is obstructing CSF flow.\n    - `transependymal edema`: Indicates high intraventricular pressure resulting from the obstruction.\n    - `callosal angle of 74^\\circ`: The angle is acute, but this is a secondary effect of severe ventricular dilation from the obstruction, not the specific DESH pattern of NPH.\n- **Verdict:** This is a clear case of non-communicating (obstructive) hydrocephalus. **Incorrect**.\n\n**Option D: Patient D**\n- **Clinical Presentation:** The patient, aged $68$ years, is recovering from an aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), a known cause of communicating hydrocephalus due to blood products impairing CSF absorption at the arachnoid granulations.\n- **MRI Findings:**\n    - EI of $0.36$: Confirms ventriculomegaly.\n    - `diffuse sulcal effacement without DESH configuration`: This indicates generalized increased intracranial pressure but lacks the specific pattern seen in idiopathic NPH.\n    - `patent aqueduct with flow void`: Confirms that the hydrocephalus is of the communicating type.\n    - `callosal angle of 110^\\circ`: This angle is obtuse (greater than $100^\\circ$). This is inconsistent with the typical morphology of idiopathic NPH, which requires an acute angle. While this patient has communicating hydrocephalus, it does not present with the specific radiological features of the *idiopathic NPH* form that the question asks to identify, particularly regarding the callosal angle and DESH.\n- **Verdict:** This patient presents with communicating hydrocephalus secondary to SAH, but the imaging does not match the specific profile of idiopathic NPH as described. The obtuse callosal angle, a key metric given in the problem, argues strongly against this option representing the target diagnosis. **Incorrect**.\n\n**Conclusion**\nPatient A is the only candidate whose entire clinical and radiological profile aligns with the principles and specific findings of communicating hydrocephalus in the form of idiopathic NPH. The presentation includes the clinical triad, ventriculomegaly, evidence of a patent communicating system, the hallmark DESH pattern, and the characteristic acute callosal angle of $68^\\circ$.",

In communicating hydrocephalus, the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pressure is approximately uniform throughout the ventricular and subarachnoid compartments, so the proximal shunt pressure equals intracranial pressure (ICP). Assume steady, laminar flow so that the pressure drop across each series element is proportional to volumetric flow, and that pressure changes due to posture arise solely from hydrostatic columns. Ignore any antisiphon devices, nonlinear valve behavior, or compliance.\n\nGiven:\n- Valve resistance $R_{\\text{valve}} = 10$ mmHg/(mL/min) and catheter resistance $R_{\\text{catheter}} = 5$ mmHg/(mL/min).\n- Supine posture: proximal pressure equals intracranial pressure $P_{\\text{prox,sup}} = 12$ mmHg; peritoneal pressure $P_{\\text{perit,sup}} = 7$ mmHg; vertical height difference between the ventricular catheter tip and peritoneal catheter tip $h_{\\text{sup}} = 0$ m.\n- Upright posture: proximal pressure equals intracranial pressure $P_{\\text{prox,upr}} = -3$ mmHg; peritoneal pressure $P_{\\text{perit,upr}} = 12$ mmHg; vertical height difference (peritoneum below ventricles) $h_{\\text{upr}} = 0.50$ m.\n- Cerebrospinal fluid density $\\rho = 1000$ kg/m$^3$ and gravitational acceleration $g = 9.81$ m/s$^2$.\n- Pressure conversion $1$ mmHg $= 133.322$ Pa.\n\nStarting from the linear resistance model for laminar flow through series elements and the hydrostatic pressure contribution $\\rho g h$ between compartments at different heights, derive expressions for the steady volumetric drainage rate in the supine and upright postures.

Express your final answer as a dimensionless number rounded to three significant figures.",
            "solution": "The problem asks for the ratio of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) drainage rates in the upright and supine postures for a patient with a ventriculoperitoneal shunt. The analysis is based on a linear hydraulic resistance model for steady, laminar flow.\n\nFirst, we establish the governing equation for flow through the shunt. The volumetric flow rate, $Q$, is proportional to the total pressure drop, $\\Delta P_{\\text{total}}$, across the shunt and inversely proportional to the total hydraulic resistance, $R_{\\text{total}}$. This is analogous to Ohm's law in electrical circuits:\n$$Q = \\frac{\\Delta P_{\\text{total}}}{R_{\\text{total}}}$$\n\nThe shunt consists of a valve and a catheter in series. For components in series, the total resistance is the sum of the individual resistances:\n$$R_{\\text{total}} = R_{\\text{valve}} + R_{\\text{catheter}}$$\n\nThe total pressure drop, $\\Delta P_{\\text{total}}$, is the difference in the piezometric pressures between the proximal (inlet in the cerebral ventricles) and distal (outlet in the peritoneal cavity) ends of the shunt. The piezometric pressure at a point combines the static gauge pressure, $P$, and the hydrostatic pressure, $\\rho g z$, where $\\rho$ is the fluid density, $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity, and $z$ is the vertical height relative to a reference datum.\n\nLet the proximal inlet be at pressure $P_{\\text{prox}}$ and height $z_{\\text{prox}}$, and the distal outlet be at pressure $P_{\\text{perit}}$ and height $z_{\\text{dist}}$. The total pressure drop driving the flow is:\n$$\\Delta P_{\\text{total}} = (P_{\\text{prox}} + \\rho g z_{\\text{prox}}) - (P_{\\text{perit}} + \\rho g z_{\\text{dist}})$$\nRearranging this expression gives:\n$$\\Delta P_{\\text{total}} = P_{\\text{prox}} - P_{\\text{perit}} + \\rho g (z_{\\text{prox}} - z_{\\text{dist}})$$\nWe define the vertical height difference as $h = z_{\\text{prox}} - z_{\\text{dist}}$. The problem specifies $h$ as the vertical distance of the peritoneum below the ventricles, which is consistent with this definition. A positive $h$ indicates a siphon effect that contributes to the flow. The total pressure drop is thus:\n$$\\Delta P_{\\text{total}} = P_{\\text{prox}} - P_{\\text{perit}} + \\rho g h$$\nThe term $\\rho g h$ represents the hydrostatic pressure contribution. All terms in this equation must be in consistent units. The given pressures $P_{\\text{prox}}$ and $P_{\\text{perit}}$ are in units of mmHg, while the resistances are in mmHg/(mL/min). The hydrostatic pressure term $\\rho g h$ is naturally calculated in Pascals (Pa). We must convert it to mmHg using the given conversion factor, which we will denote as $k_{\\text{conv}} = 133.322 \\text{ Pa/mmHg}$.\n\nThe general expression for the drainage rate is therefore:\n$$Q = \\frac{P_{\\text{prox}} - P_{\\text{perit}} + \\frac{\\rho g h}{k_{\\text{conv}}}}{R_{\\text{valve}} + R_{\\text{catheter}}}$$\n\nNow, we derive the expressions for the specific postures.\n\n**Supine Posture:**\nIn the supine posture, the vertical height difference is zero.\nGiven: $P_{\\text{prox,sup}}$, $P_{\\text{perit,sup}}$, and $h_{\\text{sup}} = 0$.\nThe hydrostatic term is zero: $\\rho g h_{\\text{sup}} = 0$.\nThe expression for the supine drainage rate, $Q_{\\text{sup}}$, is:\n$$Q_{\\text{sup}} = \\frac{P_{\\text{prox,sup}} - P_{\\text{perit,sup}}}{R_{\\text{valve}} + R_{\\text{catheter}}}$$\n\n**Upright Posture:**\nIn the upright posture, there is a significant vertical height difference.\nGiven: $P_{\\text{prox,upr}}$, $P_{\\text{perit,upr}}$, and $h_{\\text{upr}}$.\nThe expression for the upright drainage rate, $Q_{\\text{upr}}$, includes the hydrostatic contribution:\n$$Q_{\\text{upr}} = \\frac{P_{\\text{prox,upr}} - P_{\\text{perit,upr}} + \\frac{\\rho g h_{\\text{upr}}}{k_{\\text{conv}}}}{R_{\\text{valve}} + R_{\\text{catheter}}}$$\n\n**Ratio of Drainage Rates:**\nThe problem asks for the ratio $Q_{\\text{upr}} / Q_{\\text{sup}}$.\n$$\\frac{Q_{\\text{upr}}}{Q_{\\text{sup}}} = \\frac{\\left( \\frac{P_{\\text{prox,upr}} - P_{\\text{perit,upr}} + \\frac{\\rho g h_{\\text{upr}}}{k_{\\text{conv}}}}{R_{\\text{valve}} + R_{\\text{catheter}}} \\right)}{\\left( \\frac{P_{\\text{prox,sup}} - P_{\\text{perit,sup}}}{R_{\\text{valve}} + R_{\\text{catheter}}} \\right)}$$\nThe total resistance term, $R_{\\text{valve}} + R_{\\text{catheter}}$, cancels out:\n$$\\frac{Q_{\\text{upr}}}{Q_{\\text{sup}}} = \\frac{P_{\\text{prox,upr}} - P_{\\text{perit,upr}} + \\frac{\\rho g h_{\\text{upr}}}{k_{\\text{conv}}}}{P_{\\text{prox,sup}} - P_{\\text{perit,sup}}}$$\n\nNow we substitute the given numerical values:\n- $P_{\\text{prox,sup}} = 12$ mmHg\n- $P_{\\text{perit,sup}} = 7$ mmHg\n- $P_{\\text{prox,upr}} = -3$ mmHg\n- $P_{\\text{perit,upr}} = 12$ mmHg\n- $h_{\\text{upr}} = 0.50$ m\n- $\\rho = 1000$ kg/m$^3$\n- $g = 9.81$ m/s$^2$\n- $k_{\\text{conv}} = 133.322$ Pa/mmHg\n\nFirst, calculate the hydrostatic pressure contribution in the upright posture in units of mmHg:\n$$\\Delta P_{\\text{hydro,upr}} = \\frac{\\rho g h_{\\text{upr}}}{k_{\\text{conv}}} = \\frac{(1000 \\text{ kg/m}^3)(9.81 \\text{ m/s}^2)(0.50 \\text{ m})}{133.322 \\text{ Pa/mmHg}} = \\frac{4905 \\text{ Pa}}{133.322 \\text{ Pa/mmHg}} \\approx 36.790 \\text{ mmHg}$$\n\nNext, calculate the total pressure drop in the numerator (upright posture):\n$$\\Delta P_{\\text{total,upr}} = P_{\\text{prox,upr}} - P_{\\text{perit,upr}} + \\Delta P_{\\text{hydro,upr}} = -3 \\text{ mmHg} - 12 \\text{ mmHg} + 36.790 \\text{ mmHg} = 21.790 \\text{ mmHg}$$\n\nThen, calculate the total pressure drop in the denominator (supine posture):\n$$\\Delta P_{\\text{total,sup}} = P_{\\text{prox,sup}} - P_{\\text{perit,sup}} = 12 \\text{ mmHg} - 7 \\text{ mmHg} = 5 \\text{ mmHg}$$\n\nFinally, compute the ratio:\n$$\\frac{Q_{\\text{upr}}}{Q_{\\text{sup}}} = \\frac{\\Delta P_{\\text{total,upr}}}{\\Delta P_{\\text{total,sup}}} = \\frac{21.790}{5} = 4.358$$\n\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to three significant figures.\n$$\\frac{Q_{\\text{upr}}}{Q_{\\text{sup}}} \\approx 4.36$$\nThis result indicates that the drainage rate is substantially higher in the upright posture, primarily due to the large siphoning effect created by the hydrostatic column of CSF in the shunt catheter.",
