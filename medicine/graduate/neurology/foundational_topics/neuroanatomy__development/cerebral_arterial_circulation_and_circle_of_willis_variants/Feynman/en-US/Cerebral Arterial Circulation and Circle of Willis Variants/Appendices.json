            "problem": "In the cerebral circulation, collateral transfer across the Circle of Willis (CoW) often relies on the Posterior Communicating Artery (PCom). Consider a segment of the PCom modeled as a rigid, straight, circular cylinder conducting laminar flow of blood approximated as a Newtonian fluid of dynamic viscosity $\\mu$, with segment length $L$ and luminal radius $r$. The hydraulic resistance $R$ for laminar flow in such a geometry is governed by the Hagen–Poiseuille law, $R=\\frac{8\\mu L}{\\pi r^{4}}$. Suppose a Circle of Willis variant exhibits hypoplasia of the PCom such that the radius of this segment is reduced to $\\frac{r}{2}$ while $L$ and $\\mu$ remain unchanged. Using first principles embodied by the Hagen–Poiseuille relation, determine the multiplicative change in hydraulic resistance and, assuming the volumetric flow rate $Q$ through this PCom must be held constant to sustain collateral perfusion from the Internal Carotid Artery (ICA) to the Posterior Cerebral Artery (PCA), determine the multiplicative change in the pressure drop $\\Delta P$ required across this segment. Express your final answer as a single exact dimensionless number. No rounding is required. Additionally, in your reasoning, explain the implications of this resistance change for collateral capacity through hypoplastic PComs in Circle of Willis variants.",
            "solution": "The problem is well-posed and scientifically grounded, resting on the fundamental principles of fluid dynamics as applied to a simplified model of blood flow in a cerebral artery. The assumptions—approximating a blood vessel as a rigid cylindrical pipe and blood as a Newtonian fluid experiencing laminar flow—are standard first-order approximations in hemodynamics, allowing for the application of the Hagen–Poiseuille law. All necessary parameters and conditions are provided to reach a unique, meaningful solution.\n\nWe are asked to determine the multiplicative change in hydraulic resistance and the required multiplicative change in pressure drop for a segment of the Posterior Communicating Artery (PCom) that has undergone hypoplasia, reducing its radius by half.\n\nLet the initial state of the PCom be denoted by subscript $1$ and the hypoplastic state by subscript $2$.\n\nThe initial hydraulic resistance, $R_1$, is given by the Hagen–Poiseuille law:\n$$R_1 = \\frac{8\\mu L}{\\pi r_1^4}$$\nwhere $\\mu$ is the dynamic viscosity of the blood, $L$ is the length of the artery segment, and $r_1$ is the initial luminal radius. The problem statement gives the initial radius as $r$, so we have $r_1 = r$.\n$$R_1 = \\frac{8\\mu L}{\\pi r^4}$$\n\nIn the hypoplastic state, the radius is reduced to half its original value. Thus, the new radius $r_2$ is:\n$$r_2 = \\frac{r_1}{2} = \\frac{r}{2}$$\nThe viscosity $\\mu$ and length $L$ are stated to remain unchanged. The new hydraulic resistance, $R_2$, is therefore:\n$$R_2 = \\frac{8\\mu L}{\\pi r_2^4}$$\nSubstituting the expression for $r_2$:\n$$R_2 = \\frac{8\\mu L}{\\pi \\left(\\frac{r}{2}\\right)^4} = \\frac{8\\mu L}{\\pi \\frac{r^4}{16}}$$\nRearranging the terms, we get:\n$$R_2 = 16 \\left( \\frac{8\\mu L}{\\pi r^4} \\right)$$\nRecognizing that the term in the parentheses is the initial resistance $R_1$, we can write:\n$$R_2 = 16 R_1$$\nThe multiplicative change in hydraulic resistance is the ratio $\\frac{R_2}{R_1}$.\n$$\\frac{R_2}{R_1} = 16$$\nThus, the resistance increases by a factor of $16$.\n\nNext, we determine the multiplicative change in the pressure drop, $\\Delta P$, required to maintain a constant volumetric flow rate, $Q$. The relationship between pressure drop, flow rate, and resistance is analogous to Ohm's law for electrical circuits:\n$$\\Delta P = Q R$$\nFor the initial state, we have:\n$$\\Delta P_1 = Q_1 R_1$$\nFor the hypoplastic state, we have:\n$$\\Delta P_2 = Q_2 R_2$$\nThe problem specifies that the volumetric flow rate must be held constant, which means $Q_2 = Q_1$. Let's denote this constant flow rate as $Q$.\nWe have already determined that $R_2 = 16 R_1$. Substituting these relationships into the expression for $\\Delta P_2$:\n$$\\Delta P_2 = Q_1 (16 R_1) = 16 (Q_1 R_1)$$\nSince $\\Delta P_1 = Q_1 R_1$, we find:\n$$\\Delta P_2 = 16 \\Delta P_1$$\nThe multiplicative change in the pressure drop is the ratio $\\frac{\\Delta P_2}{\\Delta P_1}$.\n$$\\frac{\\Delta P_2}{\\Delta P_1} = 16$$\nThe multiplicative change in the required pressure drop is also $16$.\n\nThe implications of this result for collateral capacity in Circle of Willis variants are profound. The Hagen–Poiseuille equation demonstrates that hydraulic resistance is inversely proportional to the fourth power of the radius ($R \\propto \\frac{1}{r^4}$). This extreme sensitivity means that even a moderate reduction in vessel caliber, such as the $50\\%$ reduction in radius seen in hypoplasia, leads to a dramatic, non-linear increase in resistance—in this case, a $16$-fold increase.\n\nIn a physiological context, the pressure gradient ($\\Delta P$) available to drive blood flow through a collateral channel like the PCom is not arbitrary; it is limited by the systemic blood pressure and the pressures in the connected arterial territories. To maintain a constant, adequate blood flow ($Q$) through a hypoplastic PCom with $16$ times the resistance, the body would need to generate a pressure gradient $16$ times larger than normal. Such a massive increase is hemodynamically unfeasible. In reality, with a limited available pressure gradient, the flow rate will be drastically reduced according to $Q = \\frac{\\Delta P}{R}$. If the resistance $R$ increases $16$-fold, the flow $Q$ will decrease by a factor of $16$ for the same $\\Delta P$. This renders the hypoplastic PCom largely ineffective as a collateral pathway. Should the primary blood supply to the posterior circulation be compromised (e.g., via vertebrobasilar insufficiency or occlusion), a person with this anatomic variant would have a severely diminished capacity to reroute blood from the anterior circulation (via the ICA) to the affected posterior territories. This anatomical feature is therefore a significant risk factor for ischemic stroke, as it constitutes a failure point in the brain's natural hemodynamic backup system.",

            "solution": "The problem is validated as self-contained, scientifically grounded, and well-posed. The assumptions provided—steady laminar flow of an incompressible Newtonian fluid through rigid cylindrical vessels with equal pressure drops, viscosity, and length—are standard idealizations used in hemodynamics to apply the principles of fluid mechanics. These conditions allow for the application of the Hagen-Poiseuille equation, a fundamental relationship in fluid dynamics. The anatomical context and given arterial diameters are physiologically plausible. The problem is objective and contains no logical contradictions or missing information.\n\nThe core principle governing this problem is the Hagen-Poiseuille law for volumetric flow rate, $Q$, of a viscous, incompressible fluid in laminar flow through a long cylindrical pipe of constant cross-section. The equation is:\n$$\nQ = \\frac{\\Delta P \\pi r^4}{8 \\eta L}\n$$\nwhere $\\Delta P$ is the pressure drop across the pipe, $r$ is the internal radius of the pipe, $\\eta$ is the dynamic viscosity of the fluid, and $L$ is the length of the pipe.\n\nThe problem provides the diameters, $d$, of the arteries, which are related to the radius by $r = d/2$. Substituting this into the Hagen-Poiseuille equation gives the flow rate in terms of diameter:\n$$\nQ = \\frac{\\Delta P \\pi (d/2)^4}{8 \\eta L} = \\frac{\\Delta P \\pi d^4}{128 \\eta L}\n$$\nLet $Q_R$ and $Q_L$ be the volumetric flow rates through the right and left vertebral arteries, respectively. Their diameters are $d_R$ and $d_L$. According to the problem statement, we assume the pressure drop $\\Delta P$, the fluid viscosity $\\eta$, and the effective segment length $L$ are identical for both arteries. Therefore, we can write the flow rates for each artery as:\n$$\nQ_R = \\frac{\\pi \\Delta P}{128 \\eta L} d_R^4\n$$\n$$\nQ_L = \\frac{\\pi \\Delta P}{128 \\eta L} d_L^4\n$$\nThe term $\\frac{\\pi \\Delta P}{128 \\eta L}$ is a constant for both inflow paths. Let us denote this constant by $k$:\n$$\nk = \\frac{\\pi \\Delta P}{128 \\eta L}\n$$\nThe flow rates can then be expressed more simply as:\n$$\nQ_R = k d_R^4\n$$\n$$\nQ_L = k d_L^4\n$$\nThe total basilar inflow, $Q_{\\text{total}}$, is the sum of the inflows from the right and left vertebral arteries:\n$$\nQ_{\\text{total}} = Q_R + Q_L = k d_R^4 + k d_L^4 = k(d_R^4 + d_L^4)\n$$\nThe fractional contribution of an artery to the total flow is the ratio of its individual flow rate to the total flow rate. The fractional contribution of the right vertebral artery, $F_R$, is:\n$$\nF_R = \\frac{Q_R}{Q_{\\text{total}}} = \\frac{k d_R^4}{k(d_R^4 + d_L^4)}\n$$\nThe constant $k$ cancels, yielding the expression for the fractional contribution in terms of diameters only:\n$$\nF_R = \\frac{d_R^4}{d_R^4 + d_L^4}\n$$\nSimilarly, the fractional contribution of the left vertebral artery, $F_L$, is:\n$$\nF_L = \\frac{Q_L}{Q_{\\text{total}}} = \\frac{k d_L^4}{k(d_R^4 + d_L^4)} = \\frac{d_L^4}{d_R^4 + d_L^4}\n$$\nThese expressions represent the first part of the required derivation. Note that $F_R + F_L = \\frac{d_R^4}{d_R^4 + d_L^4} + \\frac{d_L^4}{d_R^4 + d_L^4} = \\frac{d_R^4 + d_L^4}{d_R^4 + d_L^4} = 1$, as expected.\n\nThe problem provides the following diameters: $d_R = 3.5 \\ \\mathrm{mm}$ and $d_L = 1.8 \\ \\mathrm{mm}$. Since the fractional contributions are ratios of diameters raised to the same power, the units are irrelevant and will cancel out. We can use the numerical values directly.\n\nFirst, we calculate the fourth power of each diameter:\n$$\nd_R^4 = (3.5)^4 = 150.0625\n$$\n$$\nd_L^4 = (1.8)^4 = 10.4976\n$$\nNext, we calculate the sum of these values:\n$$\nd_R^4 + d_L^4 = 150.0625 + 10.4976 = 160.5601\n$$\nNow, we can compute the fractional contributions:\nFor the right vertebral artery:\n$$\nF_R = \\frac{150.0625}{160.5601} \\approx 0.9346210...\n$$\nFor the left vertebral artery:\n$$\nF_L = \\frac{10.4976}{160.5601} \\approx 0.0653789...\n$$\nThe problem requires rounding each fractional contribution to four significant figures.\n$$\nF_R \\approx 0.9346\n$$\n$$\nF_L \\approx 0.06538\n$$\nThe final answer is to be expressed as a dimensionless row matrix with the right fraction followed by the left fraction.",
