Using the independence of sites: A failure of release must occur at every one of the $n$ sites. The probability of failure at a single site is $(1-p)$.

With fixed $n$ and $q$, as $p$ increases from $0$ to $1$, the probability of observing exactly one release event increases monotonically.**\n\nThe probability of observing exactly one release event is $P(K=1)$. Using the binomial probability mass function with $k=1$:\n$$ P(K=1) = \\binom{n}{1} p^1 (1-p)^{n-1} = np(1-p)^{n-1} $$\nLet's call this probability $f(p) = np(1-p)^{n-1}$. To check for monotonicity, we examine its derivative with respect to $p$ for $p \\in (0, 1)$. We assume $n>1$, as $n=1$ is a trivial case.\nUsing the product rule for differentiation:\n$$ \\frac{df}{dp} = \\frac{d}{dp} \\left[ np(1-p)^{n-1} \\right] = n \\left[ 1 \\cdot (1-p)^{n-1} + p \\cdot (n-1)(1-p)^{n-2}(-1) \\right] $$\n$$ \\frac{df}{dp} = n (1-p)^{n-2} \\left[ (1-p) - p(n-1) \\right] $$\n$$ \\frac{df}{dp} = n (1-p)^{n-2} [ 1 - p - np + p ] $$\n$$ \\frac{df}{dp} = n (1-p)^{n-2} (1 - np) $$\nFor $p \\in (0,1)$ and $n>1$, the term $n(1-p)^{n-2}$ is always positive.

Let's check this equality:\n$$ \\sigma^2 \\stackrel{?}{=} q \\cdot m $$\nSubstituting our derived expressions for $\\sigma^2$ and $m$:\n$$ q^2\\lambda \\stackrel{?}{=} q \\cdot (q\\lambda) $$\n$$ q^2\\lambda = q^2\\lambda $$\nThe equality holds. Both parts of the statement are correct: the distribution approaches a Poisson distribution, and in this limit, the relationship $\\sigma^2 = qm$ is valid.\n\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**F. If vesicle fusion is followed by rapid endocytic recycling within the stimulus window, allowing a single site to fuse more than one vesicle in the same trial, the same binomial expressions for the mean and variance still apply unchanged.**\n\nThe binomial model is predicated on a set of Bernoulli trials. A defining characteristic of a Bernoulli trial is that it has exactly two outcomes. In this context, the outcomes for each site are \"release one vesicle\" (success) or \"release zero vesicles\" (failure). The assumption that \"each release site can, at most, fuse one vesicle\" is fundamental to this model.\nIf a single site can fuse more than one vesicle, the random variable $X_i$ for site $i$ is no longer a Bernoulli variable, as it can take values in $\\{0, 1, 2, \\dots\\}$. The total number of released vesicles, $K = \\sum X_i$, is no longer a sum of i.i.d. Bernoulli variables and therefore does not follow a binomial distribution. Consequently, the expressions for the mean ($npq$) and variance ($np(1-p)q^2$), which are specific to the binomial distribution, are no longer applicable. This change in the physical process invalidates the mathematical model.\n\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**",

It is deemed **valid**. I will proceed with a full, reasoned solution.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe problem is solved in two parts as requested. All derivations are from first principles based on the provided model.\n\n**Part 1: Expected Fractional Depression**\n\nBefore the first pulse at $t=0$, the readily releasable pool (RRP) is at its full capacity. The number of vesicles is $N(0^-) = N_{\\max}$.\n\nThe release process is stochastic. Each of the $N_{\\max}$ vesicles has an independent probability $p$ of being released upon arrival of the action potential. The number of vesicles released, let us denote it by the random variable $N_{\\mathrm{rel}}$, therefore follows a binomial distribution:\n$$ N_{\\mathrm{rel}} \\sim B(n, k) \\quad \\text{where } n = N_{\\max} \\text{ and } k = p $$\nThe probability of releasing exactly $k$ vesicles is given by $P(N_{\\mathrm{rel}}=k) = \\binom{N_{\\max}}{k} p^k (1-p)^{N_{\\max}-k}$.\n\nThe problem asks for the *expected* fractional depression. First, we find the expected number of released vesicles, $E[N_{\\mathrm{rel}}]$. For a binomial distribution $B(n,p)$, the expectation is $np$.\n$$ E[N_{\\mathrm{rel}}] = N_{\\max} p $$\nThe fractional depression is defined as the number of released vesicles divided by the initial number of vesicles in the RRP. The expected fractional depression, $D_f$, is this expectation divided by the initial capacity $N_{\\max}$.\n$$ D_f = \\frac{E[N_{\\mathrm{rel}}]}{N(0^-)} = \\frac{N_{\\max} p}{N_{\\max}} = p $$\nUsing the given value for the per-vesicle release probability, $p=0.4$:\n$$ D_f = 0.4 $$\nRounding to four significant figures as required, the expected fractional depression is $0.4000$.\n\n**Part 2: Expected Number of Vesicles at $t = 50\\,\\mathrm{ms}$**\n\nImmediately after the first pulse at $t=0^+$, the RRP is depleted by the number of released vesicles. The number of vesicles remaining is $N(0^+) = N_{\\max} - N_{\\mathrm{rel}}$. Since $N_{\\mathrm{rel}}$ is a random variable, so is $N(0^+)$. The expected number of vesicles remaining is:\n$$ E[N(0^+)] = E[N_{\\max} - N_{\\mathrm{rel}}] = E[N_{\\max}] - E[N_{\\mathrm{rel}}] = N_{\\max} - N_{\\max} p = N_{\\max}(1-p) $$\nThe refilling of the RRP begins from this depleted state. The problem states that refilling is a first-order process, where the rate of refilling is proportional to the number of available (empty) docking sites. Let $N(t)$ be the number of vesicles in the RRP at time $t > 0$. The number of empty sites is $N_{\\max} - N(t)$.\n\nThe rate of change of $N(t)$ is described by the following differential equation:\n$$ \\frac{dN(t)}{dt} = k_{\\mathrm{refill}} (N_{\\max} - N(t)) $$\nThis is a first-order linear ordinary differential equation. We can solve it by separation of variables.\n$$ \\frac{dN}{N_{\\max} - N} = k_{\\mathrm{refill}} dt $$\nIntegrating both sides:\n$$ \\int \\frac{1}{N_{\\max} - N} dN = \\int k_{\\mathrm{refill}} dt $$\n$$ -\\ln|N_{\\max} - N| = k_{\\mathrm{refill}} t + C $$\nwhere $C$ is the constant of integration.\n$$ N_{\\max} - N(t) = \\exp(-k_{\\mathrm{refill}} t - C) = A \\exp(-k_{\\mathrm{refill}} t) $$\nwhere $A = \\exp(-C)$. Rearranging for $N(t)$:\n$$ N(t) = N_{\\max} - A \\exp(-k_{\\mathrm{refill}} t) $$\nTo find the constant $A$, we use the initial condition at $t=0$. We are interested in the expected number of vesicles, so we use the expected value $E[N(0^+)]$ as the initial condition for the recovery process. Let the expected number of vesicles at time $t$ be $E[N(t)]$.\nAt $t=0$, we have $E[N(0)] = N_{\\max}(1-p)$.\n$$ E[N(0)] = N_{\\max} - A \\exp(0) $$\n$$ N_{\\max}(1-p) = N_{\\max} - A $$\n$$ A = N_{\\max} - N_{\\max}(1-p) = N_{\\max} p $$\nSubstituting $A$ back into the solution for the expected number of vesicles:\n$$ E[N(t)] = N_{\\max} - (N_{\\max} p) \\exp(-k_{\\mathrm{refill}} t) $$\n$$ E[N(t)] = N_{\\max} (1 - p \\exp(-k_{\\mathrm{refill}} t)) $$\nWe need to calculate this value at $t = 50\\,\\mathrm{ms} = 50 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{s} = 0.05\\,\\mathrm{s}$.\nThe given parameters are $N_{\\max}=10$, $p=0.4$, and $k_{\\mathrm{refill}}=3\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$.\n$$ E[N(0.05)] = 10 \\left(1 - 0.4 \\exp(-3 \\times 0.05)\\right) $$\n$$ E[N(0.05)] = 10 \\left(1 - 0.4 \\exp(-0.15)\\right) $$\nNow, we compute the numerical value:\n$$ \\exp(-0.15) \\approx 0.860707976 $$\n$$ E[N(0.05)] \\approx 10 \\left(1 - 0.4 \\times 0.860707976\\right) $$\n$$ E[N(0.05)] \\approx 10 \\left(1 - 0.34428319\\right) $$\n$$ E[N(0.05)] \\approx 10 \\left(0.65571681\\right) $$\n$$ E[N(0.05)] \\approx 6.5571681 $$\nRounding to four significant figures, the expected number of vesicles is $6.557$.\n\nThe two results are the expected fractional depression, $0.4000$, and the expected number of vesicles at $t=50\\,\\mathrm{ms}$, $6.557$.",

A solution will be derived.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe first task is to derive how the peak calcium concentration $[Ca^{2+}]$ scales with the radial distance $r$ from the channel. We are told the calcium signal is \"quasi-steady\", which implies that the time derivative of the concentration is zero, $\\frac{\\partial [Ca^{2+}]}{\\partial t} = 0$. The diffusion process is governed by the diffusion equation. For a steady-state condition, this simplifies to Laplace's equation:\n$$ D \\nabla^2 [Ca^{2+}] = 0 $$\nwhere $D$ is the diffusion coefficient and $\\nabla^2$ is the Laplacian operator.\n\nThe problem specifies spherical symmetry in three dimensions. In spherical coordinates, the Laplacian of a function that depends only on the radius $r$ is:\n$$ \\nabla^2 = \\frac{1}{r^2} \\frac{d}{dr} \\left( r^2 \\frac{d}{dr} \\right) $$\nLetting $C(r)$ represent the calcium concentration $[Ca^{2+}](r)$, the equation becomes:\n$$ \\frac{1}{r^2} \\frac{d}{dr} \\left( r^2 \\frac{dC}{dr} \\right) = 0 $$\nMultiplying by $r^2$ and integrating with respect to $r$ gives:\n$$ r^2 \\frac{dC}{dr} = k_1 $$\nwhere $k_1$ is a constant of integration. This constant is related to the flux of calcium ions from the open channel (the point source). Rearranging and integrating a second time:\n$$ \\int dC = \\int \\frac{k_1}{r^2} dr $$\n$$ C(r) = -\\frac{k_1}{r} + k_2 $$\nwhere $k_2$ is the second integration constant. We set the boundary condition that far from the source, the calcium concentration approaches the background level, $C(r) \\to C_{bg}$ as $r \\to \\infty$. In terms of the concentration increase above baseline, $\\Delta C(r) = C(r) - C_{bg}$, this means $\\Delta C(r) \\to 0$ as $r \\to \\infty$. For the equation $\\Delta C(r) = -k_1/r + (k_2 - C_{bg})$, this implies the constant $(k_2 - C_{bg})$ must be zero. Thus, the concentration increase above baseline is inversely proportional to the distance from the source.\n$$ [Ca^{2+}](r) \\propto \\frac{1}{r} $$\nThis shows that the peak calcium concentration at the sensor scales inversely with its distance $r$ from the channel.\n\nNext, we express the fractional change in peak calcium at the sensor due to RIM removal. Let $[Ca^{2+}]_{0}$ be the concentration at the baseline distance $r_0$ and $[Ca^{2+}]_{1}$ be the concentration at the new distance $r_1$. Using the scaling relation $[Ca^{2+}](r) = \\frac{K}{r}$ for some proportionality constant $K$, we have:\n$$ [Ca^{2+}]_{0} = \\frac{K}{r_0} $$\n$$ [Ca^{2+}]_{1} = \\frac{K}{r_1} $$\nThe fractional change is the ratio of the new concentration to the original concentration:\n$$ \\frac{[Ca^{2+}]_{1}}{[Ca^{2+}]_{0}} = \\frac{K/r_1}{K/r_0} = \\frac{r_0}{r_1} $$\n\nNow, we relate the release probability $p$ to the local calcium concentration. The problem states that fusion requires cooperative binding with four binding sites, consistent with a Hill-type dependence. The release probability $p$ is described by the Hill equation with a Hill coefficient $n=4$:\n$$ p \\propto \\frac{[Ca^{2+}]^n}{K_{d}^n + [Ca^{2+}]^n} $$\nwhere $K_d$ is the apparent dissociation constant. A standard approximation in nanodomain signaling models, especially when emphasizing cooperativity, is to consider the low-concentration regime where $[Ca^{2+}] \\ll K_d$. In this limit, the denominator $K_{d}^n + [Ca^{2+}]^n \\approx K_{d}^n$, which is a constant. The release probability then becomes directly proportional to the calcium concentration raised to the power of the Hill coefficient:\n$$ p \\propto [Ca^{2+}]^n $$\nWith $n=4$, we have:\n$$ p \\propto [Ca^{2+}]^4 $$\nLet $p_0$ be the release probability at distance $r_0$ and $p_1$ be the probability at $r_1$.\n$$ p_0 = \\beta [Ca^{2+}]_{0}^4 $$\n$$ p_1 = \\beta [Ca^{2+}]_{1}^4 $$\nwhere $\\beta$ is a proportionality constant. The fractional change in release probability is:\n$$ \\frac{p_1}{p_0} = \\frac{\\beta [Ca^{2+}]_{1}^4}{\\beta [Ca^{2+}]_{0}^4} = \\left( \\frac{[Ca^{2+}]_{1}}{[Ca^{2+}]_{0}} \\right)^4 $$\nSubstituting our previous result for the concentration ratio:\n$$ \\frac{p_1}{p_0} = \\left( \\frac{r_0}{r_1} \\right)^4 $$\nThis provides the symbolic expression for the fractional change in release probability.\n\nFinally, we evaluate these fractions numerically.\nThe given values are:\n$r_{0} = 30\\ \\mathrm{nm}$\n$r_{1} = r_{0} + 20\\ \\mathrm{nm} = 30\\ \\mathrm{nm} + 20\\ \\mathrm{nm} = 50\\ \\mathrm{nm}$\n\nThe fractional change in peak calcium concentration is:\n$$ \\frac{[Ca^{2+}]_{1}}{[Ca^{2+}]_{0}} = \\frac{r_0}{r_1} = \\frac{30\\ \\mathrm{nm}}{50\\ \\mathrm{nm}} = \\frac{3}{5} = 0.6 $$\nRounding to four significant figures gives $0.6000$.\n\nThe fractional change in release probability is:\n$$ \\frac{p_1}{p_0} = \\left( \\frac{r_0}{r_1} \\right)^4 = \\left( \\frac{30}{50} \\right)^4 = \\left( \\frac{3}{5} \\right)^4 = (0.6)^4 = 0.1296 $$\nThis value is already at four significant figures.\n\nThe two dimensionless quantities are the fractional change in calcium concentration, $0.6000$, and the fractional change in release probability, $0.1296$.",
