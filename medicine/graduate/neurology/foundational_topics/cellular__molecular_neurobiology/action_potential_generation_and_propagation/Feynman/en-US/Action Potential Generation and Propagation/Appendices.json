All parameters and equations are standard. The provided values are consistent with those derived from the original squid giant axon experiments. The problem is well-defined, with sufficient information for a unique solution. Therefore, the problem is deemed valid.\n\nThe solution consists of two parts: a mechanistic decomposition of the action potential and a quantitative calculation of the peak ionic currents.\n\n**Part 1: Mechanistic Decomposition of the Action Potential**\n\nAn action potential is a transient, all-or-nothing electrical signal generated by the neuronal membrane. The Hodgkin-Huxley model describes this phenomenon through the voltage- and time-dependent dynamics of sodium and potassium ion channels. The phases are as follows:\n\n1.  **Threshold Depolarization**: An injected current depolarizes the membrane from its resting potential of approximately $-65 \\,\\mathrm{mV}$ to a threshold potential, typically around $-55 \\,\\mathrm{mV}$. At this threshold, the biophysics of the voltage-gated sodium channels create a regenerative, positive-feedback loop.\n\n2.  **Rapid Upstroke (Rising Phase)**: Upon reaching threshold, the voltage-gated sodium channels rapidly open. This is described by the activation gate variable $m$, which responds quickly to depolarization. The conductance to sodium, $g_{Na} = \\bar{g}_{Na} m^3 h$, increases dramatically. As $V$ is far more negative than $E_{Na}$ (e.g., $-55 \\,\\mathrm{mV}$ vs $+55 \\,\\mathrm{mV}$), there is a large inward driving force for $\\mathrm{Na}^{+}$ ions. The resulting influx of positive charge, the inward sodium current $I_{Na}$, causes the membrane potential to rapidly depolarize and move towards $E_{Na}$.\n\n3.  **Overshoot**: The membrane potential becomes positive, exceeding $0 \\,\\mathrm{mV}$. As $V$ approaches $E_{Na}$, the inward driving force on $\\mathrm{Na}^{+}$ diminishes. The peak of the action potential occurs when the net transmembrane current changes sign from inward to outward.\n\n4.  **Repolarization (Falling Phase)**: This phase is driven by two interdependent processes. First, the sodium channels begin to inactivate. The inactivation gate, $h$, which responds slowly to depolarization, closes, reducing $g_{Na}$ and terminating the inward $\\mathrm{Na}^{+}$ current. Second, the voltage-gated potassium channels, which are slower to open than the sodium channels, reach their maximal activation. The potassium activation gate, $n$, reaches its peak value, maximizing the potassium conductance $g_{K} = \\bar{g}_{K} n^4$. With a highly positive membrane potential and a very negative potassium reversal potential ($E_{K} = -80 \\,\\mathrm{mV}$), the outward driving force on $\\mathrm{K}^{+}$ is strong. The resulting large outward potassium current, $I_{K}$, rapidly repolarizes the membrane, driving $V$ back towards negative values.\n\n5.  **Afterhyperpolarization (Undershoot)**: The potassium channels are also slow to close. As the membrane potential returns to near-rest values, the $n$ gates have not yet fully closed. The potassium conductance $g_{K}$ remains elevated above its resting value, causing the membrane potential to transiently hyperpolarize beyond the resting potential, approaching $E_{K}$. As the $n$ gates close, $g_{K}$ returns to its resting level, and the membrane potential is restored to its resting state of $-65 \\,\\mathrm{mV}$.\n\n**Part 2: Quantitative Calculation of Peak Ionic Currents**\n\nWe use the provided formulae and parameters to calculate the peak sodium and potassium current densities. The general formula for ionic current density is $I_{ion} = g_{ion} (V - E_{ion})$. Note that the product of conductance in $\\mathrm{mS/cm^{2}}$ and potential in $\\mathrm{mV}$ yields current density in $\\mathrm{\\mu A/cm^{2}}$, since $1\\,\\mathrm{mS} \\times 1\\,\\mathrm{mV} = (10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{S}) \\times (10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{V}) = 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{A} = 1\\,\\mathrm{\\mu A}$. Conversion to $\\mathrm{mA/cm^{2}}$ requires dividing by $1000$.\n\n**Peak Fast Inward Sodium Current Density ($I_{Na}^{\\mathrm{peak}}$)**\n\nAt the moment of peak sodium current, the system state is given as $V = -15 \\,\\mathrm{mV}$, $m = 0.90$, and $h = 0.65$. The maximal conductance is $\\bar{g}_{Na} = 120 \\,\\mathrm{mS/cm^{2}}$ and the reversal potential is $E_{Na} = +55 \\,\\mathrm{mV}$.\n\nFirst, calculate the sodium conductance, $g_{Na}$:\n$$g_{Na} = \\bar{g}_{Na} m^3 h = (120 \\,\\mathrm{mS/cm^{2}}) \\times (0.90)^{3} \\times (0.65)$$\n$$g_{Na} = 120 \\times 0.729 \\times 0.65 \\,\\mathrm{mS/cm^{2}} = 56.862 \\,\\mathrm{mS/cm^{2}}$$\n\nNext, calculate the electrochemical driving force, $(V - E_{Na})$:\n$$V - E_{Na} = -15 \\,\\mathrm{mV} - 55 \\,\\mathrm{mV} = -70 \\,\\mathrm{mV}$$\n\nFinally, calculate the peak sodium current density, $I_{Na}^{\\mathrm{peak}}$:\n$$I_{Na}^{\\mathrm{peak}} = g_{Na} (V - E_{Na}) = (56.862 \\,\\mathrm{mS/cm^{2}}) \\times (-70 \\,\\mathrm{mV})$$\n$$I_{Na}^{\\mathrm{peak}} = -3980.34 \\,\\mathrm{\\mu A/cm^{2}}$$\nThe negative sign correctly indicates an inward current (influx of positive charge).\n\nConverting to $\\mathrm{mA/cm^{2}}$ and rounding to four significant figures:\n$$I_{Na}^{\\mathrm{peak}} = -3.98034 \\,\\mathrm{mA/cm^{2}} \\approx -3.980 \\,\\mathrm{mA/cm^{2}}$$\n\n**Peak Outward Potassium Current Density ($I_{K}^{\\mathrm{peak}}$)**\n\nAt the moment of peak potassium current, the system state is given as $V = +10 \\,\\mathrm{mV}$ and $n = 0.85$. The maximal conductance is $\\bar{g}_{K} = 36 \\,\\mathrm{mS/cm^{2}}$ and the reversal potential is $E_{K} = -80 \\,\\mathrm{mV}$.\n\nFirst, calculate the potassium conductance, $g_{K}$:\n$$g_{K} = \\bar{g}_{K} n^4 = (36 \\,\\mathrm{mS/cm^{2}}) \\times (0.85)^{4}$$\n$$g_{K} = 36 \\times 0.52200625 \\,\\mathrm{mS/cm^{2}} = 18.792225 \\,\\mathrm{mS/cm^{2}}$$\n\nNext, calculate the electrochemical driving force, $(V - E_{K})$:\n$$V - E_{K} = 10 \\,\\mathrm{mV} - (-80 \\,\\mathrm{mV}) = +90 \\,\\mathrm{mV}$$\n\nFinally, calculate the peak potassium current density, $I_{K}^{\\mathrm{peak}}$:\n$$I_{K}^{\\mathrm{peak}} = g_{K} (V - E_{K}) = (18.792225 \\,\\mathrm{mS/cm^{2}}) \\times (90 \\,\\mathrm{mV})$$\n$$I_{K}^{\\mathrm{peak}} = 1691.30025 \\,\\mathrm{\\mu A/cm^{2}}$$\nThe positive sign correctly indicates an outward current (efflux of positive charge).\n\nConverting to $\\mathrm{mA/cm^{2}}$ and rounding to four significant figures:\n$$I_{K}^{\\mathrm{peak}} = 1.69130025 \\,\\mathrm{mA/cm^{2}} \\approx 1.691 \\,\\mathrm{mA/cm^{2}}$$\n\nThe calculated peak current densities are $I_{Na}^{\\mathrm{peak}} = -3.980 \\,\\mathrm{mA/cm^{2}}$ and $I_{K}^{\\mathrm{peak}} = 1.691 \\,\\mathrm{mA/cm^{2}}$.

            "problem": "An unmyelinated axon is modeled as a long, uniform cylinder of radius $a$ and diameter $d=2a$. The axoplasm has resistivity $R_i$ (in $\\Omega\\cdot\\mathrm{m}$), and the membrane has specific capacitance $C_m$ (in $\\mathrm{F}/\\mathrm{m}^2$). Near the leading edge of an action potential, the net ionic current density can be linearized as an inward, regenerative term with effective conductance slope per unit area $g^{*}$ (in $\\mathrm{S}/\\mathrm{m}^2$), so that the local voltage dynamics around threshold are dominated by passive axial spread and a linear reaction term representing gating-positive feedback.\n\nStarting only from conservation of charge, Ohm’s law, and these definitions, derive a one-dimensional cable Partial Differential Equation (PDE) for small depolarizations $V(x,t)$ near threshold that contains an axial diffusion term and a linear reaction term. From this PDE, determine the minimal traveling-wave speed $v$ of the depolarizing front as a function of $a$, $R_i$, $C_m$, and $g^{*}$, and use this expression to show how $v$ scales with the axon diameter $d$.

            "solution": "The problem is assessed to be valid. It is scientifically grounded in the principles of biophysics and electrophysiology, specifically cable theory and reaction-diffusion models of action potential propagation. The problem is well-posed, objective, self-contained, and provides physically plausible parameters. It asks for a standard derivation and calculation, which has a unique and meaningful solution.\n\nWe begin by deriving the one-dimensional cable equation from first principles. Consider a small cylindrical segment of the axon of radius $a$ and infinitesimal length $dx$. The axoplasm has resistivity $R_i$, the membrane has specific capacitance $C_m$, and the effective linear conductance per unit area is $g^*$. The voltage depolarization is $V(x,t)$.\n\nAccording to the law of conservation of charge (Kirchhoff's current law), the net current flowing into the internal axoplasmic segment must be zero. This means the axial current entering the segment at position $x$ must equal the sum of the axial current leaving at $x+dx$ and the total current flowing outward across the membrane of the segment. Let $i_{axial}(x)$ be the axial current and $i_m$ be the outward membrane current per unit length. For the segment from $x$ to $x+dx$, we have:\n$$i_{axial}(x) = i_{axial}(x+dx) + i_m dx$$\nRearranging and taking the limit as $dx \\to 0$, we get:\n$$-\\frac{\\partial i_{axial}}{\\partial x} = i_m$$\n\nNext, we express both currents in terms of the voltage $V(x,t)$.\nThe axial current, $i_{axial}$, is driven by the voltage gradient along the axon. From Ohm's law, the resistance of the axoplasm segment of length $dx$ is $dR = R_i \\frac{dx}{A}$, where $A = \\pi a^2$ is the cross-sectional area. The voltage drop is $dV = -i_{axial} dR$. Thus, $i_{axial} = -\\frac{1}{dR/dx} \\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial x} = -\\frac{A}{R_i} \\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial x}$.\nSubstituting $A = \\pi a^2$:\n$$i_{axial}(x,t) = -\\frac{\\pi a^2}{R_i} \\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial x}$$\n\nThe membrane current per unit length, $i_m$, has two components: a capacitive current, $i_c$, and an ionic current, $i_{ion}$.\n$$i_m = i_c + i_{ion}$$\nThe capacitive current is due to the change in charge stored on the membrane. The capacitance per unit length is $c_m = C_m \\times (\\text{circumference}) = C_m (2\\pi a)$. The current is $i_c = c_m \\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial t}$.\n$$i_c = 2\\pi a C_m \\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial t}$$\nThe ionic current reflects the flow of ions across the membrane through channels. The problem states this is an inward, regenerative current with an effective conductance slope per unit area $g^*$. An inward current is, by convention, negative. So, the ionic current density $J_{ion}$ is given by $J_{ion} = -g^* V$. The ionic current per unit length is this density multiplied by the circumference:\n$$i_{ion} = J_{ion} \\times (2\\pi a) = -2\\pi a g^* V$$\nCombining the components, the total membrane current per unit length is:\n$$i_m = 2\\pi a C_m \\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial t} - 2\\pi a g^* V$$\n\nNow, we substitute the expressions for $i_{axial}$ and $i_m$ into the charge conservation equation $-\\frac{\\partial i_{axial}}{\\partial x} = i_m$:\n$$-\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} \\left(-\\frac{\\pi a^2}{R_i} \\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial x}\\right) = 2\\pi a C_m \\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial t} - 2\\pi a g^* V$$\n$$\\frac{\\pi a^2}{R_i} \\frac{\\partial^2 V}{\\partial x^2} = 2\\pi a C_m \\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial t} - 2\\pi a g^* V$$\nTo obtain the final PDE for $V(x,t)$, we rearrange to isolate the time derivative:\n$$2\\pi a C_m \\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial t} = \\frac{\\pi a^2}{R_i} \\frac{\\partial^2 V}{\\partial x^2} + 2\\pi a g^* V$$\n$$\\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial t} = \\frac{\\pi a^2}{R_i (2\\pi a C_m)} \\frac{\\partial^2 V}{\\partial x^2} + \\frac{2\\pi a g^*}{2\\pi a C_m} V$$\n$$\\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial t} = \\frac{a}{2 R_i C_m} \\frac{\\partial^2 V}{\\partial x^2} + \\frac{g^*}{C_m} V$$\nThis is the required one-dimensional reaction-diffusion equation with an axial diffusion term and a linear reaction term.\n\nTo find the speed of a traveling-wave solution, we assume a solution of the form $V(x,t) = V(z)$, where $z = x-vt$ is the coordinate in a moving reference frame. The derivatives transform as $\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t} = -v \\frac{d}{dz}$ and $\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} = \\frac{d}{dz}$. Substituting these into the PDE yields an ordinary differential equation (ODE) for $V(z)$:\n$$-v \\frac{dV}{dz} = \\frac{a}{2 R_i C_m} \\frac{d^2V}{dz^2} + \\frac{g^*}{C_m} V$$\n$$\\left(\\frac{a}{2 R_i C_m}\\right) \\frac{d^2V}{dz^2} + v \\frac{dV}{dz} + \\left(\\frac{g^*}{C_m}\\right) V = 0$$\nThis is a second-order linear homogeneous ODE.

Real roots imply the discriminant must be non-negative:\n$$v^2 - \\frac{2ag^*}{R_i C_m^2} \\geq 0$$\nThe minimal speed, $v$, corresponds to the case where the discriminant is zero.

Since $k$ is assumed to be constant with temperature, we can establish a ratio:\n$$ \\frac{W(T_2)}{W(T_1)} = \\frac{k \\cdot \\tau_n(T_2)}{k \\cdot \\tau_n(T_1)} = \\frac{\\tau_n(T_2)}{\\tau_n(T_1)} $$\nUsing our previously derived relationship for the time constants:\n$$ \\frac{W(T_2)}{W(T_1)} = \\frac{\\frac{1}{3} \\tau_n(T_1)}{\\tau_n(T_1)} = \\frac{1}{3} $$\nTherefore, the new spike width $W(T_2)$ is one-third of the original spike width $W(T_1)$.\n\nWe are given the initial spike width $W(T_1) = W(20^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}) = 2.4~\\mathrm{ms}$. We can calculate the new spike width $W(T_2)$:\n$$ W(T_2) = W(30^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}) = \\frac{1}{3} W(20^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}) = \\frac{1}{3} \\cdot 2.4~\\mathrm{ms} = 0.8~\\mathrm{ms} $$\n\nThe problem asks for the change in spike width, $\\Delta W$, which is defined as:\n$$ \\Delta W = W(T_2) - W(T_1) $$\nSubstituting the values:\n$$ \\Delta W = 0.8~\\mathrm{ms} - 2.4~\\mathrm{ms} = -1.6~\\mathrm{ms} $$\nThe question requires the answer to be rounded to three significant figures.\n$$ \\Delta W = -1.60~\\mathrm{ms} $$\nThe negative sign indicates that the spike width decreases as the temperature increases, which is consistent with the acceleration of channel kinetics.",
