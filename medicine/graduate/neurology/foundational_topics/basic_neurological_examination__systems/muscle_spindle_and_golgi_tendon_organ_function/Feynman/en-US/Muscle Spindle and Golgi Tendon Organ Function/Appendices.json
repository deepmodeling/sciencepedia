            "introduction": "The central nervous system does not simply listen to muscle spindles; it actively directs their sensitivity to match motor intent. This is achieved through the fusimotor system, where static and dynamic gamma motor neurons selectively tune the spindle's response to muscle length and velocity, respectively. This practice  provides a quantitative exercise in how this \"gain control\" works, allowing you to calculate the direct impact of fusimotor drive on the fundamental sensory properties of a primary afferent.",

            "problem": "A muscle spindle primary afferent is modeled as producing a mean firing rate $F(L,V)$ that depends on muscle length $L$ and lengthening velocity $V$. The sensitivity of the afferent to length and velocity, respectively, is quantified by the gains $k_{L}$ and $k_{V}$, defined under standardized, low-bias conditions as $k_{L}=\\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial L}$ and $k_{V}=\\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial V}$. In this preparation, the baseline gains are $k_{L}=5$ spikes/mm and $k_{V}=0.2$ spikes/(mm/s).\n\nStatic gamma motor neuron activity increases the bias tension predominantly in nuclear chain and static bag intrafusal fibers, which increases the slope of the length transduction pathway, while dynamic gamma motor neuron activity selectively augments tension in dynamic bag fibers, which increases the slope of the velocity transduction pathway. Empirically, these effects can be treated as multiplicative scalings of the corresponding gains by factors that reflect the fractional increase in sensitivity.\n\nSuppose static gamma activation increases the length gain by $40\\%$ and dynamic gamma activation increases the velocity gain by $150\\%$, with no cross-coupling between the pathways. Compute the new gains $k_{L}^{\\prime}$ and $k_{V}^{\\prime}$ under these fusimotor conditions.\n\nExpress your final answer as a row vector $\\big(k_{L}^{\\prime},\\,k_{V}^{\\prime}\\big)$, with the first entry in spikes/mm and the second entry in spikes/(mm/s).

We are given the baseline gains and the percentage increase for each gain due to fusimotor drive.\n\nThe length gain, or static gain, is $k_{L} = 5$ spikes/mm. Static gamma activation increases this gain by $40\\%$. A $40\\%$ increase corresponds to a multiplicative scaling factor of $(1 + 40/100) = 1.4$.

            "introduction": "Once a proprioceptive signal is generated, its journey is not over; its influence on target neurons can be precisely modulated. A key mechanism for this is presynaptic inhibition, which allows the CNS to selectively \"gate\" sensory feedback before it can evoke a postsynaptic response. This exercise  delves into the biophysical basis of this process, linking a change in presynaptic calcium influx to the final excitatory postsynaptic potential (EPSP) amplitude, a cornerstone of understanding synaptic integration in motor circuits.",

            "problem": "In a reduced spinal cord preparation, group Ia primary muscle spindle afferents make monosynaptic excitatory connections onto homonymous spinal alpha-motoneurons.

Assume the following foundational facts: (i) by the quantal hypothesis, under conditions without postsynaptic saturation and with constant driving force, the mean excitatory postsynaptic potential (EPSP; excitatory postsynaptic potential) amplitude is proportional to the mean quantal content, which in turn is proportional to the vesicular release probability at fixed numbers of sites and quantal size; (ii) over the operating range of interest for Ia terminals, the vesicular release probability scales as a power law of the local presynaptic calcium signal, such that $P \\propto [\\mathrm{Ca}]^{n}$ with $n = 3.0$.

            "introduction": "The monosynaptic stretch reflex is the fastest and most direct pathway from sensory input to motor output, crucial for postural stability. Its remarkable speed is a direct consequence of the underlying neural hardware—large, fast-conducting axons and a single, efficient central synapse. In this practice , you will perform a first-principles calculation of the total reflex latency, reinforcing your understanding of how conduction velocity and synaptic delays combine to determine the operational timescale of this fundamental sensorimotor circuit.",

            "problem": "A monosynaptic stretch reflex elicited by a brief tendon tap primarily engages the muscle spindle primary endings (Group Ia afferents), which project to the spinal cord and make a single excitatory synapse onto an alpha motor neuron that returns to the same muscle. In contrast, the Golgi tendon organ (GTO; Group Ib afferents) mediates a disynaptic inhibitory reflex that introduces an additional interneuronal synapse. For the monosynaptic pathway, consider the following scientifically plausible parameters for a lower-limb reflex arc: an afferent path length of $0.8\\,\\mathrm{m}$ from the muscle spindle to the spinal cord with conduction velocity $100\\,\\mathrm{m/s}$, a central synaptic delay of $0.5\\,\\mathrm{ms}$ at the Ia–alpha motor neuron synapse, and an efferent path length of $0.8\\,\\mathrm{m}$ from the spinal cord back to the muscle with conduction velocity $60\\,\\mathrm{m/s}$. Assume uniform conduction velocities along each path and ignore receptor transduction time, neuromuscular junction transmission, and muscle electromechanical delay, so that the requested latency is the central neural travel time from the instant of spindle activation to the arrival of the alpha motor neuron action potential at the neuromuscular junction.\n\nStarting from the definition of conduction velocity $v$ as $v = \\frac{dx}{dt}$ and the notion of synaptic delay as a fixed time added per synapse, derive from first principles the total reflex latency as a sum of afferent conduction time, central synaptic delay, and efferent conduction time.
