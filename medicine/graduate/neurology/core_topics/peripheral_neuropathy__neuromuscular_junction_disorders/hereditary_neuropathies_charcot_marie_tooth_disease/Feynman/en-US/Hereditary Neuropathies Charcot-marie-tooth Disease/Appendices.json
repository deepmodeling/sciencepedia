This practice bridges basic physics and clinical neurology, challenging you to calculate a segmental nerve conduction velocity from raw latency data.

            "problem": "A patient with genetically confirmed Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT) undergoes motor median nerve conduction testing across a short forearm segment. The inter-stimulation distance between the distal wrist site and the proximal forearm site is measured as $d=80$ $\\mathrm{mm}$. The recorded difference in onset latencies between the proximal and distal stimulations (proximal minus distal) for the compound muscle action potential is $t=1.6$ $\\mathrm{ms}$. Using the core physical definition that velocity equals path length divided by transit time, determine the segmental conduction velocity for this median nerve forearm segment. Express your answer in $\\mathrm{m/s}$ and round your result to three significant figures.\n\nGenetic testing reveals a pathogenic variant in Mitofusin 2 (*MFN2*), a gene known to cause an axonal subtype of CMT. For the purposes of this problem, encode the Charcot-Marie-Tooth subtype as an integer $s$, defined as $s=1$ for demyelinating Charcot-Marie-Tooth type $1$ and $s=2$ for axonal Charcot-Marie-Tooth type $2$. Based solely on the genetic result, assign the appropriate $s$.\n\nReport your final output as a two-entry row vector $\\begin{pmatrix} v & s \\end{pmatrix}$, where $v$ is the conduction velocity in $\\mathrm{m/s}$ (rounded to three significant figures) and $s$ is the encoded subtype as defined above.",
            "solution": "The problem presents two distinct tasks. The first is to calculate the segmental motor nerve conduction velocity in a patient. The second is to classify the subtype of Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease based on a provided genetic result. I will address each task sequentially.\n\n**Part 1: Calculation of Segmental Conduction Velocity ($v$)**\n\nThe problem states that the conduction velocity, which we denote as $v$, is defined as the path length divided by the transit time. The path length is the inter-stimulation distance, $d$, and the transit time is the difference in onset latencies between the proximal and distal stimulation sites, $t$. This relationship is expressed by the formula:\n$$v = \\frac{d}{t}$$\n\nThe given values are:\n- Inter-stimulation distance: $d = 80$ $\\mathrm{mm}$\n- Difference in onset latencies: $t = 1.6$ $\\mathrm{ms}$\n\nThe final answer for the velocity must be in units of meters per second ($\\mathrm{m/s}$). Therefore, the given values for distance and time must be converted to the base SI units of meters ($\\mathrm{m}$) and seconds ($\\mathrm{s}$), respectively.\n\nFirst, we convert the distance $d$ from millimeters ($\\mathrm{mm}$) to meters ($\\mathrm{m}$):\n$$1 \\mathrm{m} = 1000 \\mathrm{mm}$$\n$$d = 80 \\mathrm{mm} \\times \\frac{1 \\mathrm{m}}{1000 \\mathrm{mm}} = 80 \\times 10^{-3} \\mathrm{m} = 0.080 \\mathrm{m}$$\n\nNext, we convert the time $t$ from milliseconds ($\\mathrm{ms}$) to seconds ($\\mathrm{s}$):\n$$1 \\mathrm{s} = 1000 \\mathrm{ms}$$\n$$t = 1.6 \\mathrm{ms} \\times \\frac{1 \\mathrm{s}}{1000 \\mathrm{ms}} = 1.6 \\times 10^{-3} \\mathrm{s} = 0.0016 \\mathrm{s}$$\n\nNow we can substitute these converted values into the velocity formula:\n$$v = \\frac{0.080 \\mathrm{m}}{0.0016 \\mathrm{s}} = \\frac{80 \\times 10^{-3} \\mathrm{m}}{1.6 \\times 10^{-3} \\mathrm{s}}$$\n\nThe factor of $10^{-3}$ in the numerator and denominator cancels out, simplifying the calculation:\n$$v = \\frac{80}{1.6} \\mathrm{m/s} = 50 \\mathrm{m/s}$$\n\nThe problem requires the result to be rounded to three significant figures. The calculated value is exactly $50$. To express this with three significant figures, we write it as $50.0$.\nThus, the conduction velocity is $v = 50.0$ $\\mathrm{m/s}$.\n\n**Part 2: Determination of the Subtype Encoding ($s$)**\n\nThe problem defines an integer encoding, $s$, for the subtype of Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT) disease:\n- $s = 1$ for demyelinating Charcot-Marie-Tooth type $1$ (CMT1)\n- $s = 2$ for axonal Charcot-Marie-Tooth type $2$ (CMT2)\n\nThe assignment of $s$ is to be based solely on the genetic result provided. The problem states that genetic testing reveals a pathogenic variant in the Mitofusin 2 (*MFN2*) gene.\n\nIn medical genetics and neurology, it is an established fact that pathogenic variants in the *MFN2* gene are the cause of Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 2A (CMT2A). CMT2A is the most common form of CMT type 2. CMT type 2 diseases are fundamentally characterized by primary axonal degeneration, as opposed to CMT type 1 diseases, which are characterized by primary demyelination.\n\nTherefore, the *MFN2* pathogenic variant corresponds to an axonal subtype of CMT. Based on the provided encoding scheme, axonal Charcot-Marie-Tooth type $2$ is encoded as $s=2$.\n\n**Final Answer Formulation**\n\nThe final output is required to be a two-entry row vector $\\begin{pmatrix} v & s \\end{pmatrix}$. Substituting the values determined above:\n- $v = 50.0$\n- $s = 2$\n\nThe resulting vector is $\\begin{pmatrix} 50.0 & 2 \\end{pmatrix}$.",

            "introduction": "A critical aspect of managing hereditary diseases is providing accurate genetic counseling to patients and their families. This thought experiment focuses on Charcot-Marie-Tooth type 1A (CMT1A), which typically follows an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern. By applying the foundational principles of Mendelian genetics under the specified ideal conditions, you will calculate the recurrence risk, a key piece of information that empowers families to make informed decisions.",

            "problem": "A couple seeks counseling regarding the risk that their future child will have Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 1A (CMT1A). One parent is clinically affected with CMT1A caused by a heterozygous duplication of the peripheral myelin protein 22 (*PMP22*) gene on chromosome $17$. The other partner is clinically unaffected and has no personal or family history of CMT. Assume the following foundational genetic principles and conditions hold:\n\n- Autosomal dominant inheritance: a single duplicated *PMP22* allele is sufficient to cause the CMT1A phenotype.\n- Law of segregation in meiosis: each gamete from a heterozygous parent carries either the duplicated allele or the normal allele with equal probability.\n- Full penetrance: the probability that an individual with at least one duplicated *PMP22* allele expresses the phenotype is $f=1$.\n- No de novo events: the probability that a new *PMP22* duplication arises in a gamete from the unaffected partner or post-zygotically is $d=0$.\n- The affected parent is heterozygous for the duplication, and the unaffected partner does not carry the duplication.\n\nUsing these assumptions and starting from the definitions of autosomal dominant transmission, the law of segregation, and penetrance, derive the recurrence risk that a single offspring of this couple will be clinically affected with CMT1A. Express your final answer as a decimal fraction. No rounding is required.",
            "solution": "The scenario involves autosomal dominant transmission with full penetrance and no de novo events. Let the duplicated *PMP22* allele be denoted by $A$ and the normal allele by $a$. The affected parent is heterozygous, with genotype $Aa$, and the unaffected partner is homozygous normal, with genotype $aa$.\n\nBy the law of segregation, each gamete from the heterozygous parent carries either allele $A$ or allele $a$ with equal probability. Therefore, the probability that the affected parent transmits the duplicated allele is\n$$\nP(\\text{transmit } A) = \\frac{1}{2}.\n$$\nThe unaffected partner can only contribute the normal allele $a$ because they are $aa$ and there are no de novo events. Thus, the possible offspring genotypes and their probabilities are:\n- $Aa$ with probability $\\frac{1}{2}$,\n- $aa$ with probability $\\frac{1}{2}$.\n\nUnder autosomal dominant inheritance and full penetrance $f=1$, any child with genotype $Aa$ will be clinically affected, and any child with genotype $aa$ will be unaffected. Therefore, the recurrence risk $R$ that an offspring is affected equals the probability that the offspring inherits the duplicated allele multiplied by the penetrance:\n$$\nR = P(\\text{inherit } A) \\times f = \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) \\times 1 = \\frac{1}{2}.\n$$\nSince $d=0$ (no de novo events), there is no additional contribution to risk from new duplications arising in the unaffected partner or post-zygotically. Thus, the final recurrence risk is\n$$\nR = 0.5.\n$$\nExpressed as a decimal fraction, the risk is $0.5$.",

            "problem": "Consider a form of Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT) caused by biallelic pathogenic variants in the ganglioside-induced differentiation-associated protein 1 (GDAP1) gene. A family is being evaluated in which both parents are confirmed heterozygous carriers of the same pathogenic GDAP1 variant. Let the wild-type allele be denoted by $A$ and the pathogenic allele by $a$, so each parent has genotype $Aa$. One child in the family is an affected proband with genotype $aa$. A second sibling is clinically unaffected. Assume a standard autosomal recessive model with complete penetrance, no phenocopies, no de novo variants, and Mendelian segregation with equal transmission probability of parental alleles.\n\nUsing only the following foundational principles:\n- Mendel’s law of segregation, which states that each parent contributes one of two alleles at random to an offspring.\n- The definition of conditional probability, $P(X \\mid Y) = \\frac{P(X \\cap Y)}{P(Y)}$.\n\nModel the offspring genotype distribution under these assumptions and calculate the conditional probability that the unaffected sibling is a heterozygous carrier of the pathogenic GDAP1 allele, that is, has genotype $Aa$, given that the sibling is unaffected. Express your final answer as a single fraction in simplest form with no units and do not use a percentage sign.",
            "solution": "The scenario is autosomal recessive inheritance with complete penetrance, so only genotype $aa$ is affected and both $AA$ and $Aa$ are unaffected. Under Mendel’s law of segregation, for a mating of two heterozygous parents, $Aa \\times Aa$, the offspring genotype probabilities are obtained by enumerating the equally likely allele transmissions from each parent. Each parent transmits $A$ with probability $1/2$ and $a$ with probability $1/2$, independently of the other parent.\n\nTherefore, the offspring genotype probabilities are:\n- $P(AA) = P(\\text{mother } A) \\times P(\\text{father } A) = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{1}{4}$,\n- $P(Aa) = P(\\text{mother } A) \\times P(\\text{father } a) + P(\\text{mother } a) \\times P(\\text{father } A) = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{1}{4} + \\frac{1}{4} = \\frac{1}{2}$,\n- $P(aa) = P(\\text{mother } a) \\times P(\\text{father } a) = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{1}{4}$.\n\nLet $U$ denote the event that a child is unaffected. Under complete penetrance for an autosomal recessive condition, $U$ corresponds to genotypes $AA$ or $Aa$. Thus,\n$$\nP(U) = P(AA) + P(Aa) = \\frac{1}{4} + \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{3}{4}.\n$$\n\nWe are asked for the conditional probability that the unaffected sibling is a carrier, i.e., $P(\\text{carrier} \\mid U)$, where “carrier” is the event that the genotype is $Aa$. By the definition of conditional probability,\n$$\nP(\\text{carrier} \\mid U) = \\frac{P(\\text{carrier} \\cap U)}{P(U)}.\n$$\nSince a carrier $Aa$ is, by assumption of complete penetrance and the recessive model, unaffected, we have $\\text{carrier} \\cap U = \\text{carrier}$. Therefore,\n$$\nP(\\text{carrier} \\mid U) = \\frac{P(Aa)}{P(U)} = \\frac{\\frac{1}{2}}{\\frac{3}{4}} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{4}{3} = \\frac{2}{3}.\n$$\n\nThis calculation is conditioned on the parental genotypes being $Aa$ for both parents; given those parental genotypes, each child’s genotype distribution is governed by Mendelian segregation independently of the presence of an affected proband. The final probability that an unaffected sibling is a heterozygous carrier is therefore $\\frac{2}{3}$.",
