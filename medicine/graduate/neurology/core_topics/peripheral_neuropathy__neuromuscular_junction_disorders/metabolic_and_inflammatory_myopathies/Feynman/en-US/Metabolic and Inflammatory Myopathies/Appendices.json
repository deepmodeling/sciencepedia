            "problem": "A trained adult performing sustained low-to-moderate intensity exercise relies heavily on mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation in skeletal muscle. Consider complete oxidation of glucose and the saturated long-chain fatty acid palmitate (chemical formula $\\mathrm{C}_{16}\\mathrm{H}_{32}\\mathrm{O}_{2}$). Use the following foundational biochemical facts and definitions as the starting point for your derivation:\n\n- The phosphorylation-to-oxygen ratio (denoted $P/O$) is the number of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) molecules synthesized per oxygen atom reduced, and can be operationally related to electron transport chain entry by reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) and reduced flavin adenine dinucleotide (FADH$_{2}$). For this problem, take the effective yields to be $2.5$ ATP per mitochondrial NADH and $1.5$ ATP per mitochondrial FADH$_{2}$.\n\n- In skeletal muscle, cytosolic NADH produced by glycolysis is transferred into mitochondria via the glycerol phosphate shuttle, effectively contributing electrons as mitochondrial FADH$_{2}$.\n\n- For glucose ($\\mathrm{C}_{6}\\mathrm{H}_{12}\\mathrm{O}_{6}$), complete oxidation proceeds via glycolysis, the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex, and the tricarboxylic acid cycle (also called citric acid cycle), with substrate-level phosphorylation yielding ATP and guanosine triphosphate (GTP), and oxidative phosphorylation driven by NADH and FADH$_{2}$.\n\n- For saturated even-chain fatty acids, the stoichiometry of mitochondrial $\\beta$-oxidation yields $\\left(\\frac{n}{2}\\right)$ acetyl-coenzyme A (acetyl-CoA) from an $n$-carbon chain and requires $\\left(\\frac{n}{2}-1\\right)$ cycles, producing $\\left(\\frac{n}{2}-1\\right)$ NADH and $\\left(\\frac{n}{2}-1\\right)$ FADH$_{2}$ in the $\\beta$-oxidation sequence itself. Activation of a free fatty acid to acyl-CoA consumes one ATP with pyrophosphate cleavage, equivalent to $2$ high-energy phosphate bonds. Each acetyl-CoA fully oxidized in the tricarboxylic acid cycle produces $3$ NADH, $1$ FADH$_{2}$, and $1$ GTP.\n\nTask:\n1. Derive the net ATP yield from complete oxidation of $1$ mole of glucose in skeletal muscle under the glycerol phosphate shuttle assumption and the stated $P/O$ values.\n2. Derive the net ATP yield from complete oxidation of $1$ mole of palmitate under the same $P/O$ values, accounting for activation cost and the stoichiometry of $\\beta$-oxidation and the tricarboxylic acid cycle.\n3. Using your derived net yields, compute the dimensionless ratio of palmitate ATP yield to glucose ATP yield. Round your final ratio to four significant figures.\n4. Provide a mechanistic explanation, grounded in mitochondrial fatty acid import and energy systems physiology, for why carnitine palmitoyltransferase II (CPT II) deficiency limits endurance at low-to-moderate intensity.\n\nExpress the final answer in the form of the single ratio specified in item $3$ as a dimensionless number. No units are required in the final boxed answer.",
            "solution": "The problem is validated as scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. All necessary information is provided, and the premises are consistent with standard biochemical principles. The tasks involve standard bioenergetic calculations and a mechanistic explanation of a known metabolic disorder.\n\nThe solution will be developed in four parts, corresponding to the four tasks provided in the problem statement.\n\n**Part 1: Net ATP Yield from Complete Oxidation of Glucose**\n\nThe complete oxidation of one molecule of glucose ($\\mathrm{C}_{6}\\mathrm{H}_{12}\\mathrm{O}_{6}$) to $\\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ and $\\mathrm{H}_{2}\\mathrm{O}$ involves three major stages: glycolysis, the pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) reaction, and the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle. The energy yield is calculated by summing the ATP produced through substrate-level phosphorylation and oxidative phosphorylation.\n\n1.  **Glycolysis (in the cytosol):**\n    The net reaction for glycolysis is:\n    $$ \\text{Glucose} + 2\\,\\text{NAD}^+ + 2\\,\\text{ADP} + 2\\,\\text{P}_\\text{i} \\rightarrow 2\\,\\text{Pyruvate} + 2\\,\\text{NADH} + 2\\,\\text{H}^+ + 2\\,\\text{ATP} + 2\\,\\text{H}_2\\text{O} $$\n    -   **Substrate-level phosphorylation:** A net of $2$ ATP molecules are produced.\n    -   **Reduced cofactors:** $2$ NADH molecules are produced in the cytosol.\n    -   According to the problem, skeletal muscle uses the glycerol phosphate shuttle. This shuttle transfers the reducing equivalents from cytosolic NADH to mitochondrial FAD, producing FADH$_{2}$ inside the mitochondrion. Therefore, $2$ cytosolic NADH yield $2$ mitochondrial FADH$_{2}$.\n    -   **ATP from oxidative phosphorylation (via shuttle):** Each mitochondrial FADH$_{2}$ yields $1.5$ ATP. Thus, $2 \\times 1.5 = 3$ ATP.\n\n2.  **Pyruvate Dehydrogenase Complex (in the mitochondrial matrix):**\n    The two pyruvate molecules from glycolysis are converted to two acetyl-CoA molecules.\n    $$ 2\\,\\text{Pyruvate} + 2\\,\\text{NAD}^+ + 2\\,\\text{CoA} \\rightarrow 2\\,\\text{Acetyl-CoA} + 2\\,\\text{NADH} + 2\\,\\text{CO}_2 $$\n    -   **Reduced cofactors:** $2$ NADH molecules are produced in the mitochondrion.\n    -   **ATP from oxidative phosphorylation:** Each mitochondrial NADH yields $2.5$ ATP. Thus, $2 \\times 2.5 = 5$ ATP.\n\n3.  **Tricarboxylic Acid (TCA) Cycle (in the mitochondrial matrix):**\n    Each of the two acetyl-CoA molecules enters the TCA cycle. For one turn of the cycle, the yield is $3$ NADH, $1$ FADH$_{2}$, and $1$ GTP. For two turns (from one glucose molecule):\n    -   **Substrate-level phosphorylation:** $2 \\times 1\\,\\text{GTP} = 2$ GTP. Since GTP is energetically equivalent to ATP, this is counted as $2$ ATP.\n    -   **Reduced cofactors:** $2 \\times 3\\,\\text{NADH} = 6$ NADH and $2 \\times 1\\,\\text{FADH}_2 = 2$ FADH$_{2}$.

This reaction consumes one ATP molecule, which is hydrolyzed to AMP and pyrophosphate (PPi). The subsequent hydrolysis of PPi to $2$ inorganic phosphates (Pi) drives the reaction forward, making the total cost equivalent to two high-energy phosphate bonds.\n    -   Cost = $-2$ ATP.\n\n2.  **$\\beta$-Oxidation (in the mitochondrial matrix):**\n    For an $n$-carbon saturated fatty acid, $\\beta$-oxidation requires $(\\frac{n}{2}-1)$ cycles. For palmitate ($n=16$):\n    -   Number of cycles = $(\\frac{16}{2} - 1) = 7$ cycles.\n    -   Each cycle produces $1$ FADH$_{2}$ and $1$ NADH.\n    -   Total yield from $7$ cycles: $7$ FADH$_{2}$ and $7$ NADH.\n    -   The process also yields $(\\frac{n}{2}) = \\frac{16}{2} = 8$ molecules of acetyl-CoA.\n    -   **ATP from oxidative phosphorylation (from $\\beta$-oxidation cofactors):**\n        -   From $7$ NADH: $7 \\times 2.5 = 17.5$ ATP.\n        -   From $7$ FADH$_{2}$: $7 \\times 1.5 = 10.5$ ATP.\n\n3.  **Tricarboxylic Acid (TCA) Cycle (in the mitochondrial matrix):**\n    The $8$ acetyl-CoA molecules produced from $\\beta$-oxidation enter the TCA cycle.\n    -   **Substrate-level phosphorylation:** $8 \\times 1\\,\\text{GTP} = 8$ GTP, which is equivalent to $8$ ATP.\n    -   **Reduced cofactors:**\n        -   $8 \\times 3\\,\\text{NADH} = 24$ NADH.\n        -   $8 \\times 1\\,\\text{FADH}_2 = 8$ FADH$_{2}$.\n    -   **ATP from oxidative phosphorylation (from TCA cycle cofactors):**\n        -   From $24$ NADH: $24 \\times 2.5 = 60$ ATP.\n        -   From $8$ FADH$_{2}$: $8 \\times 1.5 = 12$ ATP.\n\n4.  **Total Net ATP Yield from Palmitate:**\n    The total yield is the sum of ATP produced, minus the activation cost.\n    -   Gross ATP from $\\beta$-oxidation cofactors: $17.5 + 10.5 = 28$ ATP.\n    -   Gross ATP from TCA cycle: $8 \\text{ (GTP)} + 60 \\text{ (from NADH)} + 12 \\text{ (from FADH}_2\\text{)} = 80$ ATP.\n    -   Total gross ATP = $28 + 80 = 108$ ATP.\n    -   Net ATP = Total gross ATP $-$ Activation cost.\n    $$ \\text{Net ATP}_{\\text{palmitate}} = 108 - 2 = 106 \\text{ ATP} $$\n\n**Part 3: Ratio of Palmitate ATP Yield to Glucose ATP Yield**\n\nThe ratio is calculated using the net ATP yields derived in Parts 1 and 2.\n$$ \\text{Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Net ATP}_{\\text{palmitate}}}{\\text{Net ATP}_{\\text{glucose}}} = \\frac{106}{30} $$\n$$ \\text{Ratio} \\approx 3.5333... $$\nRounding to four significant figures, the ratio is $3.533$.\n\n**Part 4: Mechanistic Explanation for CPT II Deficiency**\n\nLow-to-moderate intensity endurance exercise is predominantly aerobic, relying on mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation to generate ATP. The primary fuels are carbohydrates (muscle glycogen and blood glucose) and long-chain fatty acids. As exercise duration increases, the contribution of fatty acid oxidation to total energy expenditure becomes progressively more important, serving to spare limited carbohydrate stores.\n\nThe oxidation of long-chain fatty acids, such as palmitate, occurs within the mitochondrial matrix. However, these molecules cannot passively cross the inner mitochondrial membrane. Their entry is mediated by the carnitine shuttle system. This system involves three key proteins:\n1.  Carnitine palmitoyltransferase I (CPT I), on the outer mitochondrial membrane, which converts the fatty acyl-CoA to a fatty acylcarnitine.\n2.  Carnitine-acylcarnitine translocase, which transports the fatty acylcarnitine across the inner mitochondrial membrane into the matrix.\n3.  Carnitine palmitoyltransferase II (CPT II), located on the matrix-facing side of the inner mitochondrial membrane, which catalyzes the reverse reaction, regenerating the fatty acyl-CoA inside the matrix and releasing free carnitine.\n\nCPT II is essential for the final step of importing long-chain fatty acids into the mitochondrial matrix, where $\\beta$-oxidation takes place. A deficiency in CPT II activity severely impairs or completely blocks the ability of the muscle cell to oxidize long-chain fatty acids for energy.\n\nFrom our calculations, a single molecule of palmitate yields $106$ ATP, whereas a molecule of glucose yields only $30$ ATP. This highlights the high energy density of fatty acids, making them the ideal fuel for sustained, long-duration activity.\n\nIn an individual with CPT II deficiency, this critical, high-yield energy pathway is unavailable. During low-to-moderate intensity exercise, their skeletal muscles are forced to rely almost exclusively on carbohydrate oxidation (glycolysis and the TCA cycle). Muscle glycogen and blood glucose stores are finite and are depleted much more rapidly than in a healthy individual who can effectively switch to fat metabolism. This premature depletion of carbohydrate reserves leads to an inability to maintain the required rate of ATP synthesis, resulting in muscle fatigue, weakness, pain, and an inability to sustain exercise. This pathophysiological mechanism explains why CPT II deficiency manifests as exercise intolerance and limited endurance, particularly during prolonged, submaximal activities.",

Express your final answer as a decimal probability and round to $4$ significant figures.",
            "solution": "The problem is first validated against the required criteria.\n\n**Step 1: Extract Givens**\n- Pretest probability of immune-mediated necrotizing myopathy (IMNM): $0.2$. Let this be $P(D)$.\n- The anti-3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase (HMGCR) antibody assay returns positive. Let $T$ be the event of a positive test result.\n- The assay's sensitivity for IMNM is $0.75$. This is the conditional probability of a positive test given the presence of the disease, $P(T|D)$.\n- The assay's specificity for IMNM is $0.95$. This is the conditional probability of a negative test given the absence of the disease, $P(T^c|D^c)$, where $D^c$ is the complement of $D$ (no disease) and $T^c$ is the complement of $T$ (negative test).\n\n**Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens**\n- **Scientific Grounding**: The problem is set in a realistic clinical context (neuromuscular medicine) and employs standard, well-defined concepts from medical diagnostics and epidemiology, namely pretest probability, sensitivity, specificity, and post-test probability. The values provided for these metrics are plausible. The problem is scientifically sound.\n- **Well-Posed**: The problem provides all necessary data—a prior probability and the conditional probabilities (sensitivity and specificity) that characterize the diagnostic test—to calculate a unique post-test probability using Bayes' theorem.

There are no contradictions, ambiguities, or missing data.\n\n**Derivation of the Solution**\nThe problem requires the derivation of the post-test probability of IMNM given a positive test result, which is the conditional probability $P(D|T)$. The derivation must proceed from first principles, namely the definition of conditional probability, and culminate in Bayes' theorem.\n\nLet $D$ be the event that the patient has IMNM.\nLet $T$ be the event that the anti-HMGCR antibody assay is positive.\n\nThe givens are translated into probabilistic terms:\n1.  The pretest probability of IMNM is $P(D) = 0.2$.\n2.  The sensitivity of the assay is $P(T|D) = 0.75$.\n3.  The specificity of the assay is $P(T^c|D^c) = 0.95$.\n\nThe objective is to find the post-test probability, $P(D|T)$.\n\nBy the fundamental definition of conditional probability, the probability of event $D$ given event $T$ is:\n$$P(D|T) = \\frac{P(D \\cap T)}{P(T)}$$\nwhere $P(D \\cap T)$ is the joint probability of having the disease and testing positive.\n\nThe numerator, $P(D \\cap T)$, can be re-expressed using the definition of conditional probability for $P(T|D)$:\n$$P(T|D) = \\frac{P(T \\cap D)}{P(D)} = \\frac{P(D \\cap T)}{P(D)}$$\nRearranging this gives:\n$$P(D \\cap T) = P(T|D)P(D)$$\n\nThe denominator, $P(T)$, is the total probability of a positive test. A positive test can occur in two mutually exclusive scenarios: a true positive (the patient has the disease and tests positive) or a false positive (the patient does not have the disease but tests positive). We can express $P(T)$ using the law of total probability, partitioning the sample space by the event $D$ and its complement $D^c$:\n$$P(T) = P(T \\cap D) + P(T \\cap D^c)$$\nUsing the definition of conditional probability for each term:\n$$P(T) = P(T|D)P(D) + P(T|D^c)P(D^c)$$\n\nTo evaluate this expression, we need $P(D^c)$ and $P(T|D^c)$.\nThe probability of not having the disease, $P(D^c)$, is the complement of having the disease:\n$$P(D^c) = 1 - P(D) = 1 - 0.2 = 0.8$$\n\nThe probability of a positive test given no disease, $P(T|D^c)$, is the false positive rate. It is the complement of the specificity, which is the true negative rate, $P(T^c|D^c)$:\n$$P(T|D^c) = 1 - P(T^c|D^c) = 1 - 0.95 = 0.05$$\n\nNow, we can substitute the expressions for the numerator and denominator back into the original equation for $P(D|T)$:\n$$P(D|T) = \\frac{P(T|D)P(D)}{P(T|D)P(D) + P(T|D^c)P(D^c)}$$\nThis is the formal expression of Bayes' theorem for this problem.\n\nWe now substitute the given numerical values into this formula:\n$$P(D|T) = \\frac{(0.75)(0.2)}{(0.75)(0.2) + (0.05)(0.8)}$$\n\nCalculate the terms:\n- Numerator: $0.75 \\times 0.2 = 0.15$.\n- Denominator, first term (true positives): $0.75 \\times 0.2 = 0.15$.\n- Denominator, second term (false positives): $0.05 \\times 0.8 = 0.04$.\n- Denominator, total: $0.15 + 0.04 = 0.19$.\n\nSo, the post-test probability is:\n$$P(D|T) = \\frac{0.15}{0.19}$$\n\nTo express this as a decimal rounded to $4$ significant figures:\n$$P(D|T) = \\frac{15}{19} \\approx 0.78947368...$$\nRounding to $4$ significant figures gives $0.7895$.\n\nThus, the patient’s post-test probability of having IMNM, given the positive anti-HMGCR result, is $0.7895$.",

Objective 2: Assess the consistency of the observed $C(2)$ with the model-predicted decay from $C(1)$.\n\n**Validation Verdict:**\nThe problem is scientifically grounded, using the standard first-order elimination model for enzyme clearance, a common application in pharmacokinetics and clinical chemistry. The physiological values and scenario are realistic. The problem is well-posed and objective. It presents data that is not perfectly consistent with the given model parameters, but it explicitly asks for an assessment of this consistency, which is a valid and common task in data analysis. The problem is therefore deemed **valid**.\n\n**Solution Derivation:**\n\nThe serum CK concentration, $C(t)$, as a function of time $t$ (in days) is described by the first-order elimination model:\n$$C(t) = C(t_0) \\exp(-k(t - t_0))$$\nwhere $C(t_0)$ is the concentration at a reference time $t_0$, and $k$ is the elimination rate constant.\n\nThe rate constant $k$ is related to the half-life $t_{1/2}$ by the expression:\n$$k = \\frac{\\ln(2)}{t_{1/2}}$$\nThe problem states that the estimated half-life is $t_{1/2} = 1.5$ days. Using this value, the rate constant is:\n$$k = \\frac{\\ln(2)}{1.5} \\text{ days}^{-1}$$\n\nThe primary task is to compute the expected CK concentration on day 4, $C(4)$. We use the measurement on day 1 as our reference point, so $t_0 = 1$ day and $C(1) = 12,000$ U/L. The time of interest is $t = 4$ days. The time interval is $\\Delta t = t - t_0 = 4 - 1 = 3$ days.\n\nPlugging these values into the first-order kinetics equation:\n$$C(4) = C(1) \\exp(-k \\cdot (4-1)) = 12,000 \\exp(-3k)$$\nSubstituting aformentioned expression for $k$:\n$$C(4) = 12,000 \\exp\\left(-3 \\cdot \\frac{\\ln(2)}{1.5}\\right) = 12,000 \\exp(-2 \\ln(2))$$\nUsing the property of logarithms, $a \\ln(x) = \\ln(x^a)$, we have:\n$$C(4) = 12,000 \\exp(\\ln(2^{-2})) = 12,000 \\exp\\left(\\ln\\left(\\frac{1}{4}\\right)\\right)$$\nSince the exponential and natural logarithm functions are inverses, $\\exp(\\ln(x)) = x$:\n$$C(4) = 12,000 \\cdot \\frac{1}{4} = 3,000 \\text{ U/L}$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to three significant figures.

The time interval is $\\Delta t = 2 - 1 = 1$ day.\n$$C_{\\text{pred}}(2) = C(1) \\exp(-k \\cdot (2-1)) = 12,000 \\exp(-k)$$\n$$C_{\\text{pred}}(2) = 12,000 \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\ln(2)}{1.5}\\right) = 12,000 \\cdot 2^{-1/1.5} = 12,000 \\cdot 2^{-2/3} = \\frac{12,000}{\\sqrt[3]{4}}$$\nNumerically, this is:\n$$C_{\\text{pred}}(2) \\approx \\frac{12,000}{1.5874} \\approx 7559.5 \\text{ U/L}$$\nThe observed value is $C_{\\text{obs}}(2) = 8,000$ U/L, which is approximately $5.8\\%$ higher than the model-predicted value of $\\approx 7,560$ U/L.\n\nAlternatively, we can calculate the half-life that is implied by the two data points, $C(1) = 12,000$ U/L and $C(2) = 8,000$ U/L. Let this empirical half-life be $t'_{1/2}$ and the corresponding rate constant be $k'$.\n$$C(2) = C(1) \\exp(-k'(2-1))$$\n$$\\frac{C(2)}{C(1)} = \\frac{8,000}{12,000} = \\frac{2}{3} = \\exp(-k')$$\nSolving for $k'$:\n$$k' = -\\ln\\left(\\frac{2}{3}\\right) = \\ln\\left(\\frac{3}{2}\\right) = \\ln(1.5) \\text{ days}^{-1}$$\nThe empirical half-life is then:\n$$t'_{1/2} = \\frac{\\ln(2)}{k'} = \\frac{\\ln(2)}{\\ln(1.5)}$$\nNumerically, this is:\n$$t'_{1/2} \\approx \\frac{0.6931}{0.4055} \\approx 1.71 \\text{ days}$$\nThis empirically derived half-life of $\\approx 1.71$ days is about $14\\%$ longer than the estimated value of 1.5 days provided in the problem.\n\n**Conclusion of Assessment:** The observed CK value on day 2 is not strictly consistent with the model-predicted decay based on the given half-life of 1.5 days. The observed decay is slower than the model predicts. This discrepancy could be due to several factors, including: $1)$ the actual biological half-life in this specific patient is closer to 1.7 days than the estimate of 1.5 days, or $2)$ the assumption that CK release completely ceased on day 0 is an oversimplification, and some residual muscle breakdown and enzyme release continued between day 1 and day 2.",
