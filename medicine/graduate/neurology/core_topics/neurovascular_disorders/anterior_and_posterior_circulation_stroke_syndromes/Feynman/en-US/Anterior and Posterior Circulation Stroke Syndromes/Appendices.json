            "solution": "The problem statement is subjected to validation before proceeding to a solution.\n\n### Step 1: Extract Givens\n- **Patient Profile**: Age of $68$ years.\n- **Clinical Presentation**: Abrupt onset of vertigo, nausea, gait unsteadiness, hoarseness, and dysphagia.\n- **Antecedent Event**: Brief episode of ipsilateral neck pain.\n- **Imaging Findings**: Diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) shows an acute infarct confined to the lateral medulla on the left side. Vascular imaging demonstrates an occlusion of the left Posterior Inferior Cerebellar Artery (PICA).\n- **Required Basis for Reasoning**: (i) Vascular territories, specifically PICA perfusion of the lateral medulla. (ii) Topographic neuroanatomy of long tracts and cranial nerve nuclei. (iii) Decussation patterns of pain–temperature pathways for the face and body.\n- **Question**: To determine the constellation of neurological deficits predicted at the bedside, enumerating the injured structures and deducing sign laterality and mechanisms.\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\n- **Scientific Grounding**: The problem describes the classic presentation of a lateral medullary syndrome, also known as Wallenberg syndrome. The association between PICA occlusion (or, more commonly, vertebral artery occlusion from which PICA originates) and infarction in this specific territory is a fundamental concept in clinical neurology and neurovascular anatomy. The symptoms and anatomical structures cited are scientifically and factually correct.\n- **Well-Posedness**: The problem is well-posed. It provides a specific clinical scenario, a confirmed anatomical lesion (left lateral medulla), and its vascular cause (left PICA occlusion). It asks for a deductive conclusion about the resulting neurological signs based on established neuroanatomical principles. A unique and definitive answer can be derived from the provided information.\n- **Objectivity**: The language is objective, using standard, unambiguous medical terminology. There are no subjective or speculative elements.\n- **Flaw Analysis**:\n    1.  **Scientific/Factual Unsoundness**: None. The premise is a textbook case.\n    2.  **Non-Formalizable/Irrelevant**: None. The problem is a direct application of neuroanatomical principles.\n    3.  **Incomplete/Contradictory Setup**: None. The information is sufficient and internally consistent. The mention of neck pain is clinically relevant as it may suggest a vertebral artery dissection, a common cause of this type of stroke.\n    4.  **Unrealistic/Infeasible**: None. This is a common and clinically important stroke syndrome.\n    5.  **Ill-Posed/Poorly Structured**: None. The question is clear and leads to a stable, unique solution.\n    6.  **Pseudo-Profound/Trivial**: None. The problem requires a non-trivial synthesis of knowledge from vascular anatomy, neuroanatomy, and clinical neurology.\n    7.  **Outside Scientific Verifiability**: None. The principles and predicted outcomes are verifiable.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem statement is **valid**. A solution will be derived.\n\n### Derivation of Neurological Deficits\n\nThe problem specifies an infarct in the left lateral medulla due to occlusion of the left Posterior Inferior Cerebellar Artery (PICA). We must deduce the clinical signs by identifying the anatomical structures within this vascular territory and their functions. The lesion is on the left side.\n\n1.  **Spinothalamic Tract (Anterolateral System)**: This ascending tract conveys pain and temperature sensation from the body. The fibers decussate (cross to the opposite side) within one to two segments of their entry level in the spinal cord. Therefore, the spinothalamic tract located in the left lateral medulla carries sensory information from the **right** side of the body. Injury to this tract results in loss of pain and temperature sensation on the **contralateral** side of the body.\n\n2.  **Spinal Trigeminal Nucleus and Tract**: This system processes pain and temperature sensation for the face. Sensory fibers from the trigeminal nerve (cranial nerve V) enter the pons and descend in the spinal trigeminal tract to synapse in the spinal trigeminal nucleus, which extends down into the medulla. These fibers are **ipsilateral**. A lesion in the left lateral medulla damages these structures before they decussate, resulting in a loss of pain and temperature sensation on the **ipsilateral** side of the face (the left face).\n    *This combination of ipsilateral facial and contralateral body sensory loss is a classic \"crossed\" sensory deficit pathognomonic for a brainstem lesion.*\n\n3.  **Nucleus Ambiguus**: This motor nucleus provides efferent fibers for the glossopharyngeal nerve (cranial nerve IX) and the vagus nerve (cranial nerve X). These nerves innervate the muscles of the soft palate, pharynx, and larynx on the **ipsilateral** side. Damage to the left nucleus ambiguus causes paralysis of the left palate, pharynx, and vocal cord. Clinically, this manifests as:\n    - **Dysphagia**: Difficulty swallowing.\n    - **Hoarseness (Dysphonia)**: A breathy, weak voice due to vocal cord paralysis.\n    - **Diminished gag reflex**: On the ipsilateral (left) side.\n    - **Uvula deviation**: The uvula deviates to the strong, unaffected side (the right) upon phonation (\"ah\"), as the normal right-sided palate muscles pull unopposed. Thus, the uvula deviates **away from the side of the lesion**.\n\n4.  **Vestibular Nuclei**: The inferior and medial vestibular nuclei are located in the dorsolateral portion of the medulla and are frequently involved in PICA territory infarcts. These nuclei are critical for maintaining equilibrium and coordinating eye movements with head position via the vestibulo-ocular reflex. Damage to these nuclei on the left side leads to:\n    - **Vertigo, nausea, and vomiting**: Due to the acute imbalance in vestibular inputs to the central nervous system.\n    - **Nystagmus**: Spontaneous, rhythmic eye movements.\n    - **Gait unsteadiness and lateropulsion**: A tendency to fall toward the side of the lesion (the left).\n\n5.  **Inferior Cerebellar Peduncle (Restiform Body)**: This is a large fiber bundle connecting the medulla and spinal cord to the cerebellum. It contains spinocerebellar tracts conveying proprioceptive information from the **ipsilateral** body. Damage to this structure, or to the cerebellar hemisphere also supplied by PICA, disrupts coordination. This results in **ipsilateral** limb ataxia (e.g., dysmetria on finger-to-nose testing) and gait ataxia.\n\n6.  **Descending Sympathetic (Hypothalamospinal) Fibers**: This uncrossed tract runs from the hypothalamus through the lateral brainstem to the sympathetic preganglionic neurons in the spinal cord. Interruption of these fibers in the left lateral medulla results in **ipsilateral** Horner's syndrome, a triad of miosis (constricted pupil), ptosis (mild eyelid droop), and anhidrosis (decreased sweating) of the face.\n\n### Evaluation of Options\n\n**A. Involvement of spinal trigeminal nucleus and tract, spinothalamic (anterolateral) tract, nucleus ambiguus (cranial nerves IX and X), vestibular nuclei, inferior cerebellar peduncle, and descending hypothalamospinal fibers; predicts ipsilateral loss of facial pain–temperature, contralateral loss of body pain–temperature, dysphagia and hoarseness with diminished gag and uvula deviating away from the lesion, vertigo and nystagmus with a tendency to fall toward the lesion, ipsilateral limb ataxia, and ipsilateral Horner syndrome.**\n- **Analysis**: This option correctly lists all the principal anatomical structures within the lateral medullary territory supplied by PICA. Furthermore, it accurately predicts the complete constellation of clinical signs, including the correct laterality for each deficit (ipsilateral facial sensory loss, contralateral body sensory loss, ipsilateral ataxia, ipsilateral Horner's syndrome, falling toward the lesion, and uvula deviating away from the lesion). This aligns perfectly with the derivation.\n- **Verdict**: **Correct**.\n\n**B. Involvement of principal sensory nucleus of the trigeminal nerve in the pons, medial lemniscus, and medial longitudinal fasciculus; predicts contralateral loss of facial pain–temperature, ipsilateral loss of body pain–temperature, internuclear ophthalmoplegia, and intact swallowing.**\n- **Analysis**: The structures listed are incorrect for a lateral medullary infarct. The medial lemniscus is a medial structure. The principal sensory nucleus and medial longitudinal fasciculus are located more superiorly (in the pons) and medially. The predicted signs are consequently incorrect: the laterality of sensory loss is reversed, internuclear ophthalmoplegia is not characteristic of this syndrome, and dysphagia (implying swallowing is not intact) is a cardinal feature.\n- **Verdict**: **Incorrect**.\n\n**C. Involvement of facial nucleus, cochlear nucleus, middle cerebellar peduncle, and labyrinthine artery territory; predicts ipsilateral facial paralysis with hyperacusis and decreased lacrimation, hearing loss, and no dysphagia; pain–temperature loss is symmetric and bilateral.**\n- **Analysis**: The listed structures (facial nucleus, middle cerebellar peduncle) are primarily pontine. The clinical signs (ipsilateral facial paralysis, hearing loss) are characteristic of a lesion in the lateral pons, often due to an Anterior Inferior Cerebellar Artery (AICA) infarct, not a PICA infarct. The claim of no dysphagia is incorrect for a lateral medullary lesion, and symmetric/bilateral sensory loss is neuroanatomically inconsistent with a unilateral focal infarct.\n- **Verdict**: **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. Involvement of hypoglossal nucleus, corticospinal tract, and medial lemniscus; predicts ipsilateral tongue deviation on protrusion, contralateral hemiparesis, and contralateral loss of vibration and proprioception, with no vertigo or nystagmus.**\n- **Analysis**: This option correctly describes the Medial Medullary Syndrome (Dejerine syndrome). The structures listed—hypoglossal nucleus (CN XII), corticospinal (pyramidal) tract, and medial lemniscus—are all located in the *medial* medulla. The problem clearly specifies an infarct of the *lateral* medulla.\n- **Verdict**: **Incorrect**.\n\n**E. Isolated involvement of nucleus tractus solitarius (nucleus of the solitary tract) and dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus nerve; predicts loss of taste and impaired parasympathetic output with preserved pain–temperature and no hoarseness or dysphagia, and no vestibular symptoms.**\n- **Analysis**: This lists only a minor subset of the affected nuclei while incorrectly omitting the major tracts (spinothalamic) and other critical nuclei (spinal trigeminal, ambiguus, vestibular) that are responsible for the most prominent signs. The prediction that pain–temperature sensation is preserved and that there is no hoarseness, dysphagia, or vertigo is fundamentally wrong and contradicts the given clinical presentation and the known neuroanatomy of the syndrome.\n- **Verdict**: **Incorrect**.",

All necessary data are provided, and the definitions are clear and internally consistent.\n\nThe task is to calculate the infarct growth, which is the volume of penumbral tissue that converts to ischemic core over a specified time. The process involves three main steps:\n1.  Determine the initial volumes of the ischemic core and the salvageable penumbra.\n2.  Model the time-dependent conversion of the penumbra to core for different sub-regions.\n3.  Calculate the total volume converted over the given time interval.\n\n**Step 1: Determine Initial Volumes**\n\nThe problem defines the ischemic core and penumbra based on physiological thresholds from Computed Tomography Perfusion (CTP) imaging.\n\n-   **Ischemic Core:** The volume of tissue with Cerebral Blood Flow (CBF) below a critical threshold is considered the ischemic core.\n    $$ V_{\\text{core, initial}} = V_{CBF  12\\,\\mathrm{mL/100g/min}} = 40\\,\\mathrm{mL} $$\n\n-   **Penumbra:** The penumbra is defined as the region of hypoperfusion that is not yet part of the core. It consists of voxels with a time-to-maximum of the tissue residue function ($T_{\\text{max}}$) greater than $6\\,\\mathrm{s}$, excluding the voxels already defined as core.\n    The total volume of tissue with prolonged $T_{\\text{max}}$ is given as $V_{T_{\\text{max}} > 6\\,\\mathrm{s}} = 120\\,\\mathrm{mL}$.\n    The problem specifies that the volume of tissue that is *both* core ($CBF  12\\,\\mathrm{mL/100g/min}$) and has prolonged $T_{\\text{max}}$ ($T_{\\text{max}} > 6\\,\\mathrm{s}$) is $35\\,\\mathrm{mL}$.

The condition that perfusion is reduced to the critical level is expressed as:\n$$CPP \\leq CPP_{\\mathrm{crit}}$$\nSubstituting the definition of $CPP$, we get:\n$$MAP - P(V_e) \\leq CPP_{\\mathrm{crit}}$$\nWe can find the critical intracranial pressure, $ICP_{\\mathrm{crit}}$, that corresponds to $CPP_{\\mathrm{crit}}$:\n$$P(V_e) \\geq MAP - CPP_{\\mathrm{crit}}$$\nLet $ICP_{\\mathrm{crit}} = MAP - CPP_{\\mathrm{crit}}$. Using the given values $MAP = 90\\ \\mathrm{mmHg}$ and $CPP_{\\mathrm{crit}} = 50\\ \\mathrm{mmHg}$:\n$$ICP_{\\mathrm{crit}} = 90\\ \\mathrm{mmHg} - 50\\ \\mathrm{mmHg} = 40\\ \\mathrm{mmHg}$$\nSo, the second condition is that the intracranial pressure must be at least $40\\ \\mathrm{mmHg}$:\n$$P(V_e) \\geq 40\\ \\mathrm{mmHg}$$\nNow, we must find the edema volume $V_e$ that corresponds to this pressure, using the given pressure-volume model:\n$$\nP(V_{e}) =\n\\begin{cases}\nP_{0},  V_{e} \\leq V_{\\mathrm{res}} \\\\\nP_{0}\\,\\exp\\!\\left(\\dfrac{V_{e}-V_{\\mathrm{res}}}{\\mathrm{PVI}}\\right),  V_{e}  V_{\\mathrm{res}}\n\\end{cases}\n$$\nThe given baseline pressure is $P_{0} = 10\\ \\mathrm{mmHg}$. Since the target pressure $ICP_{\\mathrm{crit}} = 40\\ \\mathrm{mmHg}$ is greater than $P_{0}$, we must use the exponential part of the model, which applies for $V_{e}  V_{\\mathrm{res}}$. Let $V_{e, \\mathrm{crit}}$ be the edema volume at which the pressure is exactly equal to $ICP_{\\mathrm{crit}}$.\n$$ICP_{\\mathrm{crit}} = P_{0}\\,\\exp\\!\\left(\\dfrac{V_{e, \\mathrm{crit}}-V_{\\mathrm{res}}}{\\mathrm{PVI}}\\right)$$\nWe solve this equation for $V_{e, \\mathrm{crit}}$:\n$$\\frac{ICP_{\\mathrm{crit}}}{P_{0}} = \\exp\\!\\left(\\dfrac{V_{e, \\mathrm{crit}}-V_{\\mathrm{res}}}{\\mathrm{PVI}}\\right)$$\nTaking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n$$\\ln\\left(\\frac{ICP_{\\mathrm{crit}}}{P_{0}}\\right) = \\frac{V_{e, \\mathrm{crit}}-V_{\\mathrm{res}}}{\\mathrm{PVI}}$$\nMultiplying by $\\mathrm{PVI}$ and adding $V_{\\mathrm{res}}$:\n$$V_{e, \\mathrm{crit}} = V_{\\mathrm{res}} + \\mathrm{PVI} \\cdot \\ln\\left(\\frac{ICP_{\\mathrm{crit}}}{P_{0}}\\right)$$\nSince $P(V_e)$ is a monotonically increasing function of $V_e$ for $V_e  V_{\\mathrm{res}}$, the condition $P(V_e) \\geq ICP_{\\mathrm{crit}}$ is equivalent to $V_e \\geq V_{e, \\mathrm{crit}}$.\n\n**Combining Conditions and Finding the Minimal Volume**\n\nWe need to find the minimal edema volume $V_{e}^{\\ast}$ that simultaneously satisfies:\n1.  $V_{e}  V_{\\mathrm{mass}} = 5.4\\ \\mathrm{mL}$\n2.  $V_{e} \\geq V_{e, \\mathrm{crit}}$\n\nLet's calculate $V_{e, \\mathrm{crit}}$ using the provided numerical values: $V_{\\mathrm{res}} = 3\\ \\mathrm{mL}$, $\\mathrm{PVI} = 10\\ \\mathrm{mL}$, $P_0 = 10\\ \\mathrm{mmHg}$, and $ICP_{\\mathrm{crit}} = 40\\ \\mathrm{mmHg}$.\n$$V_{e, \\mathrm{crit}} = 3\\ \\mathrm{mL} + (10\\ \\mathrm{mL}) \\cdot \\ln\\left(\\frac{40\\ \\mathrm{mmHg}}{10\\ \\mathrm{mmHg}}\\right)$$\n$$V_{e, \\mathrm{crit}} = 3 + 10 \\ln(4)$$\nNumerically, this is:\n$$V_{e, \\mathrm{crit}} \\approx 3 + 10 \\times (1.386294) \\approx 3 + 13.86294 = 16.86294\\ \\mathrm{mL}$$\nThe two conditions are $V_{e}  5.4\\ \\mathrm{mL}$ and $V_{e} \\geq 16.86294\\ \\mathrm{mL}$. The set of all volumes satisfying both conditions is the intersection of the two solution sets, which is $[16.86294\\ \\mathrm{mL}, \\infty)$. The minimal value in this set is $V_{e, \\mathrm{crit}}$.\nTherefore, the minimal edema volume $V_{e}^{\\ast}$ that satisfies both conditions is:\n$$V_{e}^{\\ast} = V_{e, \\mathrm{crit}} = 3 + 10 \\ln(4)\\ \\mathrm{mL}$$\n\n**Final Calculation and Rounding**\n\nThe problem requires the final answer to be rounded to $4$ significant figures.\n$$V_{e}^{\\ast} = 3 + 10 \\ln(4) \\approx 16.8629436\\ \\mathrm{mL}$$\nRounding this value to $4$ significant figures, we get $16.86$.\nThe minimal edema volume is $16.86\\ \\mathrm{mL}$. This volume reduces $CPP$ to $50\\ \\mathrm{mmHg}$ and is also greater than the mass effect threshold of $5.4\\ \\mathrm{mL}$.",
