Immunohistochemistry ($\\text{IHC}$) for the canonical $\\text{IDH1}$ $\\text{R132H}$ substitution is used clinically to infer $\\text{IDH}$-mutation status; assume the $\\text{IHC}$ test has sensitivity $0.9$ for detecting $\\text{IDH}$-mutant disease and specificity $0.98$ for correctly identifying $\\text{IDH}$-wildtype disease.

            "solution": "The problem is subjected to validation prior to any attempt at a solution.\n\n### Step 1: Extract Givens\n- Patient age: $65$ years\n- Diagnosis: Diffuse adult glioma\n- Biomarker status categories: Isocitrate Dehydrogenase ($\\text{IDH}$)-mutant vs. $\\text{IDH}$-wildtype\n- Test: Immunohistochemistry ($\\text{IHC}$) for the $\\text{IDH1}$ $\\text{R132H}$ substitution\n- Test sensitivity for $\\text{IDH}$-mutant disease: $0.9$\n- Test specificity for $\\text{IDH}$-wildtype disease: $0.98$\n- Pre-test probability (prevalence): $P(\\text{IDH-wildtype}\\mid \\text{age } 65)=0.75$\n- Test outcome: Negative $\\text{IHC}$ result\n- Desired calculation: The posterior probability $P(\\text{IDH-wildtype} \\mid \\text{negative } \\text{IHC}, \\text{ age } 65)$\n- Required precision: Decimal fraction rounded to $4$ significant figures.\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\nThe problem is scientifically grounded, drawing on established principles of neuropathology, molecular diagnostics, and Bayesian statistics. The distinction between $\\text{IDH}$-mutant and $\\text{IDH}$-wildtype gliomas is central to the current World Health Organization classification of central nervous system tumors. The use of $\\text{IHC}$ for the R132H mutation as a surrogate for $\\text{IDH}$ mutation status is standard clinical practice. The provided values for sensitivity, specificity, and age-stratified prevalence are realistic and plausible. The problem is well-posed, providing all necessary information for a unique solution via Bayes' theorem. The terminology is precise and objective. There are no contradictions, ambiguities, or factual inaccuracies.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. A solution will be furnished.\n\nThe solution requires the application of Bayes' theorem to calculate a posterior probability based on a test result. Let us define the relevant events:\n- $W$: The event that the patient's glioma is $\\text{IDH}$-wildtype.\n- $M$: The event that the patient's glioma is $\\text{IDH}$-mutant.\n- $N$: The event that the $\\text{IHC}$ test result is negative.\n- $P$: The event that the $\\text{IHC}$ test result is positive.\n\nFrom the problem statement, we are given the following probabilities. The conditioning on age is implicit in the prior probabilities.\nThe pre-test probability, or prior, of having an $\\text{IDH}$-wildtype tumor is:\n$$ P(W) = 0.75 $$\nSince $\\text{IDH}$-wildtype and $\\text{IDH}$-mutant are mutually exclusive and exhaustive categories for diffuse gliomas, the prior probability of having an $\\text{IDH}$-mutant tumor is:\n$$ P(M) = 1 - P(W) = 1 - 0.75 = 0.25 $$\nThe sensitivity of the $\\text{IHC}$ test is the probability of a positive result given that the tumor is $\\text{IDH}$-mutant.\n$$ \\text{Sensitivity} = P(P \\mid M) = 0.9 $$\nThe specificity of the test is the probability of a negative result given that the tumor is $\\text{IDH}$-wildtype.\n$$ \\text{Specificity} = P(N \\mid W) = 0.98 $$\nWe are asked to find the posterior probability of the tumor being $\\text{IDH}$-wildtype given a negative test result, which is denoted as $P(W \\mid N)$.\n\nAccording to Bayes' theorem, this posterior probability is given by:\n$$ P(W \\mid N) = \\frac{P(N \\mid W) P(W)}{P(N)} $$\nThe term in the denominator, $P(N)$, is the total probability of a negative test result. It can be calculated using the law of total probability, summing over all possible underlying states (wildtype or mutant):\n$$ P(N) = P(N \\mid W) P(W) + P(N \\mid M) P(M) $$\nWe have been given $P(N \\mid W)$, which is the specificity. We need to determine $P(N \\mid M)$, the probability of a negative test given that the tumor is $\\text{IDH}$-mutant. This is the false negative rate, which is complementary to the sensitivity:\n$$ P(N \\mid M) = 1 - P(P \\mid M) = 1 - 0.9 = 0.1 $$\nNow we can calculate the total probability of a negative test, $P(N)$:\n$$ P(N) = (P(N \\mid W) \\times P(W)) + (P(N \\mid M) \\times P(M)) $$\n$$ P(N) = (0.98 \\times 0.75) + (0.1 \\times 0.25) $$\n$$ P(N) = 0.735 + 0.025 $$\n$$ P(N) = 0.760 $$\nWith all components determined, we can now calculate the desired posterior probability $P(W \\mid N)$:\n$$ P(W \\mid N) = \\frac{P(N \\mid W) P(W)}{P(N)} $$\n$$ P(W \\mid N) = \\frac{0.98 \\times 0.75}{0.760} $$\n$$ P(W \\mid N) = \\frac{0.735}{0.760} $$\n$$ P(W \\mid N) \\approx 0.96710526... $$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to $4$ significant figures.\n$$ P(W \\mid N) \\approx 0.9671 $$\nThus, for a $65$-year-old patient with a negative $\\text{IDH}1$ R132H $\\text{IHC}$ result, the probability that the glioma is $\\text{IDH}$-wildtype is approximately $0.9671$.",

Under the standard Stejskal–Tanner pulsed gradient framework, and assuming Gaussian, isotropic diffusion with mono-exponential signal attenuation, negligible perfusion effects, identical echo time across images, and constant coil sensitivity, the diffusion-weighted signal within a homogeneous Region of Interest (ROI) depends on the Apparent Diffusion Coefficient (ADC).

            "solution": "The problem as stated is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and contains sufficient information for a unique solution. It is based on established principles of Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and diffusion physics. We shall therefore proceed with a formal solution.\n\nThe problem requires the derivation of the Apparent Diffusion Coefficient ($\\mathrm{ADC}$) from signal intensity measurements at two different diffusion weightings ($b$-values) and subsequent calculation of a relative cellularity metric.\n\nFirst, we derive the expression for $\\mathrm{ADC}$. The problem states that the signal attenuation follows a mono-exponential model within the Stejskal–Tanner framework, assuming Gaussian, isotropic diffusion. This model relates the measured signal intensity, $S(b)$, at a given $b$-value to the signal intensity with no diffusion weighting, $S(0)$, and the $\\mathrm{ADC}$:\n$$S(b) = S(0) \\exp(-b \\cdot \\mathrm{ADC})$$\nHere, $S(0)$ represents the theoretical signal intensity at $b=0 \\,\\mathrm{s}/\\mathrm{mm}^{2}$ which is primarily dependent on proton density and relaxation times ($T_1$ and $T_2$). The term $\\exp(-b \\cdot \\mathrm{ADC})$ represents the attenuation due to the random, incoherent motion of water molecules (diffusion) over the observation time.\n\nTo solve for $\\mathrm{ADC}$, we rearrange the equation. First, we divide both sides by $S(0)$:\n$$\\frac{S(b)}{S(0)} = \\exp(-b \\cdot \\mathrm{ADC})$$\nNext, we take the natural logarithm ($\\ln$) of both sides to eliminate the exponential function:\n$$\\ln\\left(\\frac{S(b)}{S(0)}\\right) = \\ln(\\exp(-b \\cdot \\mathrm{ADC}))$$\n$$\\ln(S(b)) - \\ln(S(0)) = -b \\cdot \\mathrm{ADC}$$\nFinally, we isolate $\\mathrm{ADC}$ by dividing by $-b$. A more convenient form is obtained by using the property $\\ln(x/y) = -\\ln(y/x)$:\n$$\\mathrm{ADC} = -\\frac{1}{b} \\ln\\left(\\frac{S(b)}{S(0)}\\right) = \\frac{1}{b} \\ln\\left(\\frac{S(0)}{S(b)}\\right)$$\nThis is the required expression for calculating the $\\mathrm{ADC}$ from two measurements: one at $b=0 \\,\\mathrm{s}/\\mathrm{mm}^{2}$ (providing $S(0)$) and another at a non-zero $b$-value (providing $S(b)$).\n\nNow, we apply this derived formula to compute the $\\mathrm{ADC}$ for the two specified Regions of Interest (ROIs). The units for $\\mathrm{ADC}$ will be $\\mathrm{mm}^{2}/\\mathrm{s}$, consistent with the units of the $b$-value ($\\mathrm{s}/\\mathrm{mm}^{2}$).\n\nFor the enhancing solid tumor ROI:\nThe given data are $S_{\\text{tumor}}(0) = 760$ and $S_{\\text{tumor}}(1000) = 378$ at $b = 1000 \\,\\mathrm{s}/\\mathrm{mm}^{2}$.\n$$\\mathrm{ADC}_{\\text{tumor}} = \\frac{1}{1000} \\ln\\left(\\frac{760}{378}\\right)$$\n$$\\mathrm{ADC}_{\\text{tumor}} \\approx \\frac{1}{1000} \\ln(2.010582) \\approx \\frac{0.698433}{1000} \\approx 0.000698433 \\,\\mathrm{mm}^{2}/\\mathrm{s}$$\n\nFor the contralateral normal-appearing white matter (NWM) ROI:\nThe given data are $S_{\\text{NWM}}(0) = 820$ and $S_{\\text{NWM}}(1000) = 333$ at $b = 1000 \\,\\mathrm{s}/\\mathrm{mm}^{2}$.\n$$\\mathrm{ADC}_{\\text{NWM}} = \\frac{1}{1000} \\ln\\left(\\frac{820}{333}\\right)$$\n$$\\mathrm{ADC}_{\\text{NWM}} \\approx \\frac{1}{1000} \\ln(2.462462) \\approx \\frac{0.901174}{1000} \\approx 0.000901174 \\,\\mathrm{mm}^{2}/\\mathrm{s}$$\nAs expected from biophysical principles, the $\\mathrm{ADC}$ in the highly cellular glioblastoma is lower than in the normal-appearing white matter, reflecting restricted water diffusion.\n\nThe final step is to compute the relative cellularity. The problem defines cellularity, $C$, as being inversely proportional to the $\\mathrm{ADC}$. This can be expressed as:\n$$C = \\frac{k}{\\mathrm{ADC}}$$\nwhere $k$ is a constant of proportionality. This constant depends on tissue-specific biophysical properties but is assumed to be the same for the comparison.\n\nThe relative cellularity, $C_{\\text{rel}}$, is defined as the ratio of the tumor's cellularity to that of the normal white matter:\n$$C_{\\text{rel}} = \\frac{C_{\\text{tumor}}}{C_{\\text{NWM}}}$$\nSubstituting the inverse proportionality relationship:\n$$C_{\\text{rel}} = \\frac{k / \\mathrm{ADC}_{\\text{tumor}}}{k / \\mathrm{ADC}_{\\text{NWM}}} = \\frac{\\mathrm{ADC}_{\\text{NWM}}}{\\mathrm{ADC}_{\\text{tumor}}}$$\nNow we substitute the expressions for $\\mathrm{ADC}_{\\text{NWM}}$ and $\\mathrm{ADC}_{\\text{tumor}}$:\n$$C_{\\text{rel}} = \\frac{\\frac{1}{1000} \\ln\\left(\\frac{820}{333}\\right)}{\\frac{1}{1000} \\ln\\left(\\frac{760}{378}\\right)} = \\frac{\\ln\\left(\\frac{820}{333}\\right)}{\\ln\\left(\\frac{760}{378}\\right)}$$\nUsing the intermediate numerical values:\n$$C_{\\text{rel}} \\approx \\frac{0.901174}{0.698433} \\approx 1.29023$$\nThe problem requires this result to be rounded to three significant figures.\n$$C_{\\text{rel}} \\approx 1.29$$\nThis dimensionless number indicates that the cellularity of the glioblastoma tissue in the analyzed ROI is approximately $29\\%$ higher than that of the contralateral normal-appearing white matter, according to this model.",
