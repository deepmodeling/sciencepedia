            "problem": "Consider Traumatic Encephalopathy Syndrome (TES), a clinical syndrome associated with Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy (CTE), as a binary outcome $Y \\in \\{0,1\\}$ among retired contact sport athletes. Let the cumulative head impact index (CHII) be a continuous exposure variable $x$ capturing the accumulation of subconcussive and concussive impacts over a career. Assume that, consistent with a generalized linear modeling framework for a Bernoulli outcome, the log-odds of TES are an affine function of $x$. \n\nTask:\n1. Starting from the definition of odds $\\mathrm{odds}(Y=1 \\mid x) = \\frac{p(x)}{1-p(x)}$ and log-odds $\\ln\\!\\left(\\frac{p(x)}{1-p(x)}\\right)$, and assuming $\\ln\\!\\left(\\frac{p(x)}{1-p(x)}\\right) = \\beta_{0} + \\beta_{1} x$ for unknown parameters $\\beta_{0}$ and $\\beta_{1}$, derive the corresponding closed-form expression for $p(x)$ as a function of $(\\beta_{0}, \\beta_{1}, x)$.\n2.

Use these two calibration points to solve for $\\beta_{1}$ and $\\beta_{0}$. \n3. Interpret $\\beta_{1}$ mechanistically in terms of a dose-response: for an increment $\\Delta x$ in CHII, what is the multiplicative change in the odds of TES? Using your calibrated $\\beta_{1}$, compute the odds ratio for a $\\Delta x = 1000$ increase in CHII, expressed as a dimensionless decimal. Round your final numerical answer to four significant figures.",
            "solution": "The problem will be addressed in three parts as specified: derivation of the probability function, calibration of the model parameters, and interpretation and calculation of an odds ratio.\n\n### Part 1: Derivation of the Probability Function $p(x)$\n\nThe problem statement posits a logistic regression model where the log-odds (or logit) of the outcome $Y=1$ (presence of Traumatic Encephalopathy Syndrome, TES) is an affine function of the cumulative head impact index (CHII), $x$. The relationship is given by:\n$$\n\\ln\\!\\left(\\frac{p(x)}{1-p(x)}\\right) = \\beta_{0} + \\beta_{1} x\n$$\nwhere $p(x)$ is the probability of having TES given CHII $x$, i.e., $p(x) = P(Y=1 \\mid x)$. The term $\\frac{p(x)}{1-p(x)}$ is the odds of having TES.\n\nTo derive the expression for $p(x)$, we must solve the above equation for $p(x)$. First, we exponentiate both sides to eliminate the natural logarithm:\n$$\n\\frac{p(x)}{1-p(x)} = \\exp(\\beta_{0} + \\beta_{1} x)\n$$\nLet the right-hand side be denoted by $A$ for simplicity, so $\\frac{p(x)}{1-p(x)} = A$. We can now solve for $p(x)$ algebraically.\n$$\np(x) = A (1 - p(x))\n$$\n$$\np(x) = A - A \\cdot p(x)\n$$\n$$\np(x) + A \\cdot p(x) = A\n$$\n$$\np(x) (1 + A) = A\n$$\n$$\np(x) = \\frac{A}{1 + A}\n$$\nSubstituting back the expression for $A$:\n$$\np(x) = \\frac{\\exp(\\beta_{0} + \\beta_{1} x)}{1 + \\exp(\\beta_{0} + \\beta_{1} x)}\n$$\nThis is the closed-form expression for $p(x)$. A common alternative form is obtained by multiplying the numerator and denominator by $\\exp(-(\\beta_{0} + \\beta_{1} x))$:\n$$\np(x) = \\frac{\\exp(\\beta_{0} + \\beta_{1} x) \\cdot \\exp(-(\\beta_{0} + \\beta_{1} x))}{(1 + \\exp(\\beta_{0} + \\beta_{1} x)) \\cdot \\exp(-(\\beta_{0} + \\beta_{1} x))} = \\frac{1}{\\exp(-(\\beta_{0} + \\beta_{1} x)) + 1}\n$$\nThus, the expression for $p(x)$ is the sigmoid or logistic function:\n$$\np(x) = \\frac{1}{1 + \\exp(-(\\beta_{0} + \\beta_{1} x))}\n$$\n\n### Part 2: Calibration of Model Parameters $\\beta_{0}$ and $\\beta_{1}$\n\nWe are given two data points to determine the parameters $\\beta_{0}$ and $\\beta_{1}$.\nThe data are:\n1.  At $x_{1} = 5000$, the probability is $p(x_{1}) = 0.25$.\n2.  At $x_{2} = 15000$, the probability is $p(x_{2}) = 0.60$.\n\nWe use the log-odds form of the model, $\\ln\\!\\left(\\frac{p(x)}{1-p(x)}\\right) = \\beta_{0} + \\beta_{1} x$.\nFor the first data point:\nThe odds are $\\frac{p(x_{1})}{1-p(x_{1})} = \\frac{0.25}{1-0.25} = \\frac{0.25}{0.75} = \\frac{1}{3}$.\nThe log-odds are $\\ln(\\frac{1}{3}) = -\\ln(3)$.\nThis gives our first linear equation:\n$$\n\\beta_{0} + 5000 \\beta_{1} = -\\ln(3) \\quad \\text{(Eq. 1)}\n$$\n\nFor the second data point:\nThe odds are $\\frac{p(x_{2})}{1-p(x_{2})} = \\frac{0.60}{1-0.60} = \\frac{0.60}{0.40} = \\frac{3}{2} = 1.5$.\nThe log-odds are $\\ln(1.5)$.\nThis gives our second linear equation:\n$$\n\\beta_{0} + 15000 \\beta_{1} = \\ln(1.5) \\quad \\text{(Eq. 2)}\n$$\n\nWe now have a system of two linear equations with two unknowns, $\\beta_{0}$ and $\\beta_{1}$. To solve for $\\beta_{1}$, we subtract Equation 1 from Equation 2:\n$$\n(\\beta_{0} + 15000 \\beta_{1}) - (\\beta_{0} + 5000 \\beta_{1}) = \\ln(1.5) - (-\\ln(3))\n$$\n$$\n10000 \\beta_{1} = \\ln(1.5) + \\ln(3)\n$$\nUsing the logarithm property $\\ln(a) + \\ln(b) = \\ln(ab)$:\n$$\n10000 \\beta_{1} = \\ln(1.5 \\times 3) = \\ln(4.5)\n$$\nSolving for $\\beta_{1}$:\n$$\n\\beta_{1} = \\frac{\\ln(4.5)}{10000}\n$$\n\nTo solve for $\\beta_{0}$, we can substitute the expression for $\\beta_{1}$ back into Equation 1:\n$$\n\\beta_{0} = -\\ln(3) - 5000 \\beta_{1}\n$$\n$$\n\\beta_{0} = -\\ln(3) - 5000 \\left(\\frac{\\ln(4.5)}{10000}\\right)\n$$\n$$\n\\beta_{0} = -\\ln(3) - \\frac{\\ln(4.5)}{2}\n$$\nThis is the symbolic solution for $\\beta_{0}$. It can also be expressed as $\\ln((4.5)^{-1/2}) - \\ln(3) = \\ln\\left(\\frac{1}{3\\sqrt{4.5}}\\right)$.\n\n### Part 3: Interpretation and Calculation of the Odds Ratio\n\nThe parameter $\\beta_{1}$ quantifies the change in the log-odds of TES for a one-unit increase in CHII $x$. To interpret its effect in terms of odds, we examine the odds ratio (OR) for an increment $\\Delta x$ in CHII.\n\nThe odds at CHII $x$ are $\\mathrm{odds}(x) = \\exp(\\beta_{0} + \\beta_{1} x)$.\nThe odds at CHII $x + \\Delta x$ are $\\mathrm{odds}(x + \\Delta x) = \\exp(\\beta_{0} + \\beta_{1} (x+\\Delta x))$.\nThe odds ratio is the ratio of these two odds:\n$$\n\\mathrm{OR} = \\frac{\\mathrm{odds}(x + \\Delta x)}{\\mathrm{odds}(x)} = \\frac{\\exp(\\beta_{0} + \\beta_{1} x + \\beta_{1} \\Delta x)}{\\exp(\\beta_{0} + \\beta_{1} x)}\n$$\nUsing the property $\\exp(a+b) = \\exp(a)\\exp(b)$:\n$$\n\\mathrm{OR} = \\frac{\\exp(\\beta_{0} + \\beta_{1} x) \\exp(\\beta_{1} \\Delta x)}{\\exp(\\beta_{0} + \\beta_{1} x)} = \\exp(\\beta_{1} \\Delta x)\n$$\nThis result shows that for an increase of $\\Delta x$ in CHII, the odds of having TES are multiplied by a factor of $\\exp(\\beta_{1} \\Delta x)$. This multiplicative factor is constant and does not depend on the baseline CHII level $x$.\n\nWe are asked to compute this odds ratio for an increment of $\\Delta x = 1000$, using the calibrated value of $\\beta_{1}$.\n$$\n\\beta_{1} = \\frac{\\ln(4.5)}{10000}\n$$\nSubstituting these values into the OR formula:\n$$\n\\mathrm{OR} = \\exp\\left( \\left(\\frac{\\ln(4.5)}{10000}\\right) \\cdot 1000 \\right) = \\exp\\left(\\frac{\\ln(4.5)}{10}\\right)\n$$\nUsing the property $\\exp(a \\ln b) = b^a$:\n$$\n\\mathrm{OR} = \\exp\\left(\\frac{1}{10}\\ln(4.5)\\right) = 4.5^{1/10} = 4.5^{0.1}\n$$\nNow we compute the numerical value and round to four significant figures.\n$$\n\\mathrm{OR} \\approx 1.16158705\n$$\nRounding to four significant figures, we look at the fifth significant digit. Since it is $5$, we round up the fourth digit.\n$$\n\\mathrm{OR} \\approx 1.162\n$$",

Over a follow-up of $10$ years, the following cumulative incidences were observed: among $n_{E} = 560$ athletes with high RHI, $y_{E} = 118$ developed TES; among $n_{U} = 480$ athletes with low RHI, $y_{U} = 56$ developed TES.

The E-value quantifies the minimum strength of association that an unmeasured confounder would need to have with both the exposure and the outcome, on the risk ratio scale, to completely explain away the observed exposure–outcome association (reduce it to the null).\n\nWe begin with the core epidemiologic definition of the risk ratio. Let $Y$ denote TES, and let $E$ denote the high RHI exposure.
