This practice introduces the use of Bayes' theorem to formally update clinical suspicion based on a single, powerful biomarker: the Real-Time Quaking-Induced Conversion (RT-QuIC) assay. By working through this scenario , you will gain hands-on experience in converting pre-test probabilities into more definitive post-test probabilities, a cornerstone of evidence-based medicine.",

            "problem": "A clinician suspects sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (sCJD) in a patient with rapidly progressive cognitive decline. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) Real-Time Quaking-Induced Conversion (RT-QuIC) is obtained. Empirically, the RT-QuIC assay for sCJD has sensitivity $0.92$ and specificity $0.99$. Based on clinical features and standard imaging, the clinician’s pretest probability of sCJD is $0.20$. Assuming the test characteristics apply to this patient and the single test result is independent of other evidence, compute the post-test probability of sCJD for this patient:\n- after a positive RT-QuIC result,\n- and after a negative RT-QuIC result.\nExpress both post-test probabilities as decimals and round your answers to four significant figures.",

This exercise  builds upon the previous diagnostic challenge by integrating information from two distinct modalities: MRI imaging and CSF analysis. You will learn to calculate and apply likelihood ratios, a powerful statistical tool, to combine the diagnostic weight of each test and arrive at a final, consolidated posterior probability for CJD.

The prior probability of not having the disease is therefore $P(D^c) = 1 - P(D) = 1 - 0.10 = 0.90$.\n\nThe problem asks to use Bayes' theorem, relating prior and posterior probabilities through odds and likelihood ratios.

The rate is proportional to the product of the concentrations of the reactants, $c(t)$ and $a(t)$, giving $-\\beta c(t)a(t)$.\n\nCombining these terms gives the first ODE:\n$$\n\\frac{dc}{dt} = \\sigma - \\mu c - \\beta c a\n$$\n\nThe rate of change of the PrP$^{\\mathrm{Sc}}$ aggregate concentration, $\\frac{da}{dt}$, is determined by three processes:\n1.  **Templated Conversion (iii):** The conversion of PrP$^{\\mathrm{C}}$ generates new PrP$^{\\mathrm{Sc}}$, adding to the aggregate concentration. This is the same term that describes the consumption of $c(t)$, so it is $+\\beta c(t)a(t)$. We assume a $1:1$ stoichiometry in terms of effective seed concentration.\n2.  **Fragmentation (iv):** This process increases the number of replication-competent seeds. The rate is proportional to the current amount of aggregates, $a(t)$, giving $+k_f a(t)$. This term represents an autocatalytic amplification loop.\n3.  **Clearance (v):** A first-order process that removes aggregates, giving $-\\delta a(t)$.\n\nCombining these terms gives the second ODE:\n$$\n\\frac{da}{dt} = \\beta c a + k_f a - \\delta a = (\\beta c + k_f - \\delta) a\n$$\n\nThe complete system of ODEs is:\n$$\n\\begin{cases}\n\\frac{dc}{dt} = \\sigma - \\mu c - \\beta c a \\\\\n\\frac{da}{dt} = (\\beta c + k_f - \\delta) a\n\\end{cases}\n$$\n\n#### Part 2: Identification of Steady States\nSteady states, denoted by $(\\bar{c}, \\bar{a})$, are solutions where the concentrations do not change over time, i.e., $\\frac{dc}{dt} = 0$ and $\\frac{da}{dt} = 0$.\nThe system of algebraic equations for the steady states is:\n$$\n\\begin{cases}\n\\sigma - \\mu \\bar{c} - \\beta \\bar{c} \\bar{a} = 0 & (1) \\\\\n(\\beta \\bar{c} + k_f - \\delta) \\bar{a} = 0 & (2)\n\\end{cases}\n$$\nFrom equation $(2)$, we have two possibilities:\n\n**Case 1: The prion-free steady state**\nHere, $\\bar{a} = 0$. Substituting this into equation $(1)$:\n$$\n\\sigma - \\mu \\bar{c} - \\beta \\bar{c}(0) = 0 \\implies \\sigma - \\mu \\bar{c} = 0 \\implies \\bar{c} = \\frac{\\sigma}{\\mu}\n$$\nThis gives the prion-free steady state, $E_0 = (\\frac{\\sigma}{\\mu}, 0)$.\n\n**Case 2: The endemic (prion-infected) steady state**\nHere, $\\bar{a} \\neq 0$.

The system is given by the functions $f(c, a) = \\sigma - \\mu c - \\beta c a$ and $g(c, a) = \\beta c a + k_f a - \\delta a$.\n\nThe Jacobian matrix $J(c, a)$ is:\n$$\nJ(c, a) = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial c} & \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial a} \\\\ \\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial c} & \\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial a} \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} -\\mu - \\beta a & -\\beta c \\\\ \\beta a & \\beta c + k_f - \\delta \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nNow, we evaluate this matrix at the steady state $E_0 = (\\bar{c}, \\bar{a}) = (\\frac{\\sigma}{\\mu}, 0)$:\n$$\nJ(E_0) = \\begin{pmatrix} -\\mu - \\beta (0) & -\\beta \\left(\\frac{\\sigma}{\\mu}\\right) \\\\ \\beta (0) & \\beta \\left(\\frac{\\sigma}{\\mu}\\right) + k_f - \\delta \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} -\\mu & -\\frac{\\beta \\sigma}{\\mu} \\\\ 0 & \\frac{\\beta \\sigma}{\\mu} + k_f - \\delta \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe eigenvalues $\\lambda$ of a triangular matrix are its diagonal entries.

This transition occurs when $\\lambda_2 = 0$. The leading eigenvalue, which is the one with the largest real part, is $\\lambda_2$ (provided $\\frac{\\beta \\sigma}{\\mu} + k_f - \\delta > -\\mu$, which is generally true as prion dynamics manifest). The critical condition for the loss of stability is therefore $\\lambda_2=0$.\n\nWe set $\\lambda_2 = 0$ and solve for the corresponding value of $\\beta$, which we define as the critical conversion rate $\\beta_c$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\beta_c \\sigma}{\\mu} + k_f - \\delta = 0\n$$\nRearranging to solve for $\\beta_c$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\beta_c \\sigma}{\\mu} = \\delta - k_f\n$$\n$$\n\\beta_c = \\frac{\\mu (\\delta - k_f)}{\\sigma}\n$$\nThis expression represents the bifurcation point where the prion-free state becomes unstable, allowing for the growth of prion aggregates from infinitesimally small perturbations. If $\\beta < \\beta_c$, the prion-free state is stable. If $\\beta > \\beta_c$, it becomes unstable, and the endemic state $E_1$ emerges and is typically stable.",
