            "problem": "A neurology research team plans a balanced two-arm Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT) to evaluate a nonpharmacologic behavioral intervention for reducing Behavioral and Psychological Symptoms of Dementia (BPSD) in patients with Alzheimer-type dementia. The primary outcome is the change in the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) total score from baseline to $12$ weeks. Historical data suggest that the change scores in each arm are approximately normally distributed with a common standard deviation of $\\sigma = 8$ NPI points. The investigators aim to detect a true between-group mean difference in change scores of $\\delta = 4$ NPI points (intervention minus control) using a two-sided hypothesis test with type I error $\\alpha = 0.05$ and power $1-\\beta = 0.8$. Assume independent observations, equal allocation, and that a large-sample normal approximation is appropriate for the test statistic.\n\nStarting from the definition of the standardized test statistic for the difference between two independent means under equal variances and the normal approximation for its sampling distribution, derive the sample size per arm required to achieve the specified $\\alpha$ and power. Let $z_{p}$ denote the $p$-quantile of the standard normal distribution. Report the smallest whole number of participants per arm that satisfies the design criteria.

            "solution": "The problem statement is evaluated for validity before attempting a solution.\n\n### Step 1: Extract Givens\n- Trial design: Balanced two-arm Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT).\n- Outcome: Change in Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) total score from baseline to $12$ weeks.\n- Distribution assumption: Change scores are approximately normally distributed.\n- Common standard deviation: $\\sigma = 8$ NPI points.\n- True between-group mean difference to detect: $\\delta = 4$ NPI points.\n- Type I error rate (two-sided): $\\alpha = 0.05$.\n- Power: $1-\\beta = 0.8$.\n- Assumptions: Independent observations, equal allocation ($n_I = n_C = n$), large-sample normal approximation for the test statistic.\n- Notation: $z_{p}$ denotes the $p$-quantile of the standard normal distribution.\n- Objective: Derive the required sample size per arm, $n$, and report the smallest whole number.\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\nThe problem is assessed against the validation criteria.\n- **Scientifically Grounded:** The problem describes a standard sample size calculation for a clinical trial, which is a fundamental aspect of biostatistics and medical research design. The methodology is based on well-established statistical theory (hypothesis testing, power analysis, normal distribution). The parameters given (NPI standard deviation, effect size, $\\alpha$, power) are realistic for neuropsychiatric research.\n- **Well-Posed:** The problem provides all necessary information ($\\sigma, \\delta, \\alpha, \\beta$) to determine a unique sample size, $n$. It asks for a specific, calculable quantity.\n- **Objective:** The problem is stated in precise, quantitative, and unbiased language, free of subjective claims.\n\nThe problem does not exhibit any flaws such as scientific unsoundness, incompleteness, contradiction, or ambiguity. It is a standard, formalizable problem in applied statistics.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is deemed **valid**. A solution will be derived.\n\n### Derivation of the Sample Size Formula\nLet $\\mu_I$ and $\\mu_C$ be the true mean change in NPI scores for the intervention and control groups, respectively. The null hypothesis ($H_0$) and the two-sided alternative hypothesis ($H_A$) are:\n$$H_0: \\mu_I - \\mu_C = 0$$\n$$H_A: \\mu_I - \\mu_C \\neq 0$$\n\nLet $\\bar{X}_I$ and $\\bar{X}_C$ be the sample mean changes in the two arms, and let $n$ be the sample size per arm. The common population standard deviation is $\\sigma = 8$. The test statistic for the difference between two independent means, when $\\sigma$ is known, is given by:\n$$Z = \\frac{(\\bar{X}_I - \\bar{X}_C) - (\\mu_I - \\mu_C)}{\\sqrt{\\frac{\\sigma^2}{n} + \\frac{\\sigma^2}{n}}} = \\frac{(\\bar{X}_I - \\bar{X}_C) - (\\mu_I - \\mu_C)}{\\sigma \\sqrt{\\frac{2}{n}}}$$\nUnder the null hypothesis $H_0$, this statistic follows a standard normal distribution, $Z \\sim N(0, 1)$.\n\nThe type I error rate is $\\alpha = 0.05$. For a two-sided test, we reject $H_0$ if $|Z|  z_{1-\\alpha/2}$. The critical value is $z_{1-0.05/2} = z_{0.975}$.\n\nThe power of the test, $1-\\beta = 0.8$, is the probability of correctly rejecting $H_0$ when a specific alternative is true. Here, the specific alternative is $\\mu_I - \\mu_C = \\delta = 4$.\nPower $= P(\\text{Reject } H_0 | \\mu_I - \\mu_C = \\delta)$.\nThe rejection region is $|Z|  z_{1-\\alpha/2}$, which means $\\frac{|\\bar{X}_I - \\bar{X}_C|}{\\sigma \\sqrt{2/n}}  z_{1-\\alpha/2}$.\nPower is the probability that the observed sample difference falls into the rejection region, given that the true difference is $\\delta$.\n$$1-\\beta = P\\left(\\left|\\frac{\\bar{X}_I - \\bar{X}_C}{\\sigma \\sqrt{\\frac{2}{n}}}\\right|  z_{1-\\alpha/2} \\bigg| \\mu_I - \\mu_C = \\delta\\right)$$\nUnder the alternative hypothesis, the sampling distribution of the difference in means is $\\bar{X}_I - \\bar{X}_C \\sim N(\\delta, \\frac{2\\sigma^2}{n})$.\n\nFor a positive $\\delta$, the power is dominated by the upper tail of the rejection region. We can approximate the power by considering only this part:\n$$1-\\beta \\approx P\\left(\\bar{X}_I - \\bar{X}_C  z_{1-\\alpha/2} \\sigma \\sqrt{\\frac{2}{n}} \\bigg| \\mu_I - \\mu_C = \\delta\\right)$$\nTo evaluate this probability, we standardize the random variable $\\bar{X}_I - \\bar{X}_C$ using its distribution under the alternative hypothesis:\n$$1-\\beta \\approx P\\left( \\frac{(\\bar{X}_I - \\bar{X}_C) - \\delta}{\\sigma \\sqrt{\\frac{2}{n}}}  \\frac{z_{1-\\alpha/2} \\sigma \\sqrt{\\frac{2}{n}} - \\delta}{\\sigma \\sqrt{\\frac{2}{n}}} \\right)$$\nThe term on the left inside the probability is a standard normal variable, which we denote as $Z'$.\n$$1-\\beta \\approx P\\left( Z'  z_{1-\\alpha/2} - \\frac{\\delta \\sqrt{n}}{\\sigma \\sqrt{2}} \\right)$$\nBy definition of power, $1-\\beta = P(Z'  z_{\\beta})$. Using the symmetry of the normal distribution, $z_{\\beta} = -z_{1-\\beta}$. Thus, for the desired power, we must have:\n$$ -z_{1-\\beta} \\approx z_{1-\\alpha/2} - \\frac{\\delta \\sqrt{n}}{\\sigma \\sqrt{2}} $$\nRearranging to solve for $n$:\n$$ \\frac{\\delta \\sqrt{n}}{\\sigma \\sqrt{2}} \\approx z_{1-\\alpha/2} + z_{1-\\beta} $$\n$$ \\sqrt{n} \\approx \\frac{\\sigma \\sqrt{2} (z_{1-\\alpha/2} + z_{1-\\beta})}{\\delta} $$\n$$ n \\approx \\frac{2 \\sigma^2 (z_{1-\\alpha/2} + z_{1-\\beta})^2}{\\delta^2} $$\nThis is the general formula for the sample size per arm in a two-sample test with known variance.\n\n### Calculation\nWe substitute the given values into the derived formula:\n$\\sigma = 8$\n$\\delta = 4$\n$\\alpha = 0.05 \\implies z_{1-\\alpha/2} = z_{0.975}$\n$1-\\beta = 0.8 \\implies \\beta = 0.2 \\implies z_{1-\\beta} = z_{0.8}$\n\nThe standard values for these quantiles of the normal distribution are $z_{0.975} \\approx 1.95996$ and $z_{0.8} \\approx 0.84162$.\nPlugging these into the formula for $n$:\n$$ n = \\frac{2(8^2)(1.95996 + 0.84162)^2}{4^2} $$\n$$ n = \\frac{2 \\times 64 \\times (2.80158)^2}{16} $$\n$$ n = \\frac{128 \\times 7.84885}{16} $$\n$$ n = 8 \\times 7.84885 $$\n$$ n \\approx 62.7908 $$\n\nSince the number of participants must be a whole number, and we need to meet or exceed the specified power of $0.8$, we must round this value up to the next integer.\n$$ n = \\lceil 62.7908 \\rceil = 63 $$\nTherefore, the smallest whole number of participants required per arm is $63$.",

The AES is a validated questionnaire where higher total scores indicate greater apathy severity; typical total scores range on an ordinal scale, and change is analyzed as a continuous variable under standard assumptions for repeated measures. In the methylphenidate arm, the within-group mean change from baseline at week $12$ is $\\Delta \\mu = -4$ points, where a negative value denotes improvement (i.e., a decrease in apathy severity).

This final exercise  brings the principles of risk assessment to the bedside, focusing on the critical safety issue of drug-induced cardiac effects in geriatric psychopharmacology. You will apply a standard formula to calculate a patient's corrected QT interval ($QTc$), a vital step in making an evidence-based decision about medication safety and preventing potentially life-threatening adverse events.",
            "id": "4454871",
            "problem": "A $78$-year-old woman with Alzheimer disease presents with persistent agitation and sleep–wake dysregulation, consistent with behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD). Her electrocardiogram shows a measured $QT$ interval of $440 \\, \\mathrm{ms}$ and an $RR$ interval of $0.8 \\, \\mathrm{s}$ in sinus rhythm. You are considering citalopram for agitation due to its serotonergic effects on affective dysregulation. The corrected $QT$ interval (defined on first appearance as $QTc$) aims to remove heart rate dependence so that repolarization duration can be compared across different cycle lengths. Empirically, the ventricular repolarization duration scales with cycle length by a power law $QT(RR)=k\\,RR^{\\alpha}$, where $k$ is an individual constant under stable conditions and $\\alpha=\\frac{1}{2}$ (Bazett’s scaling).

Round your computed $QTc$ to three significant figures and express it in $\\mathrm{ms}$.",
            "solution": "The problem requires the computation of the corrected QT interval ($QTc$) for a patient and a subsequent interpretation of this value in the context of initiating a specific medication. The validation of the problem statement is the mandatory first step.\n\n### Step 1: Extract Givens\n- Patient age: $78$ years\n- Patient condition: Alzheimer disease with BPSD\n- Measured QT interval ($QT$): $440 \\, \\mathrm{ms}$\n- Measured RR interval ($RR$): $0.8 \\, \\mathrm{s}$\n- Empirical scaling law: $QT(RR) = k \\, RR^{\\alpha}$\n- Scaling exponent for Bazett's formula: $\\alpha = \\frac{1}{2}$\n- Definition of corrected interval: $QTc = \\frac{QT(RR)}{RR^{\\alpha}}$\n- Safety threshold for medication: Avoidance or discontinuation for $QTc \\geq 500 \\, \\mathrm{ms}$\n- Required output format: $QTc$ rounded to three significant figures, expressed in $\\mathrm{ms}$.\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\nThe problem is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective.\n- **Scientific Grounding:** The concepts of QT and RR intervals, heart rate correction using Bazett's formula, and the clinical pharmacology of citalopram (specifically, its potential for QT prolongation) are all standard, factually correct principles in cardiology and clinical medicine. The provided physiological values are realistic.\n- **Well-Posedness:** The problem provides all necessary data and a clear formula to calculate a unique value for the $QTc$. The question is unambiguous and has a single, stable solution.\n- **Objectivity:** The problem is framed in objective, clinical language. The interpretation is based on applying given quantitative thresholds, not on subjective opinion.\n\nThere are no scientific or factual unsoundness, no fatal ambiguity, and no missing information that would prevent a rigorous solution. The problem is deemed valid.\n\n### Step 3: Solution\n\nThe primary task is to calculate the corrected QT interval, $QTc$, using the provided data and formula. The problem specifies the use of Bazett's scaling, where the correction exponent is $\\alpha = \\frac{1}{2}$.\n\nThe definition of the corrected interval is given as:\n$$QTc = \\frac{QT(RR)}{RR^{\\alpha}}$$\n\nSubstituting the given value for the exponent, $\\alpha = \\frac{1}{2}$, we obtain Bazett's formula:\n$$QTc = \\frac{QT}{\\sqrt{RR}}$$\n\nThe problem provides the measured values:\n- $QT = 440 \\, \\mathrm{ms}$\n- $RR = 0.8 \\, \\mathrm{s}$\n\nIn the standard application of Bazett's formula, the $RR$ interval must be expressed in seconds ($s$), and the measured $QT$ interval is typically in milliseconds ($ms$). The resulting $QTc$ value is then expressed in milliseconds ($ms$). The provided data conform to this convention.\n\nSubstituting the given values into the formula:\n$$QTc = \\frac{440 \\, \\mathrm{ms}}{\\sqrt{0.8 \\, \\mathrm{s}}}$$\n\nTo be precise about the units, the definition of $QTc$ normalizes the QT interval to a standard heart rate corresponding to $RR = 1 \\, \\mathrm{s}$. The constant $k$ in the scaling law $QT = k \\cdot RR^{\\alpha}$ has units of $\\mathrm{ms} \\cdot \\mathrm{s}^{-\\alpha}$. The $QTc$ is numerically equal to $k$ when a standard $RR$ of $1\\,\\mathrm{s}$ is used, and its value is reported in $\\mathrm{ms}$. Thus, the calculation proceeds by evaluating the numerical part of the expression:\n$$QTc = \\frac{440}{\\sqrt{0.8}} \\, \\mathrm{ms}$$\n\nNow, we perform the calculation:\n$$\\sqrt{0.8} \\approx 0.89442719...$$\n$$QTc \\approx \\frac{440}{0.89442719} \\, \\mathrm{ms} \\approx 491.93403... \\, \\mathrm{ms}$$\n\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to three significant figures.\n$$QTc \\approx 492 \\, \\mathrm{ms}$$\n\nThe second part of the task is to interpret this result. The calculated baseline $QTc$ for the patient is approximately $492 \\, \\mathrm{ms}$. This value must be compared to established safety thresholds.\n1.  The problem states a threshold of $QTc \\geq 500 \\, \\mathrm{ms}$ as a level for avoidance or discontinuation of QT-prolonging drugs. The patient's value of $492 \\, \\mathrm{ms}$ is very close to this absolute upper limit.\n2.  The problem also mentions \"heightened caution above sex-specific prolongation thresholds.\" For adult females, a $QTc$ value above approximately $470 \\, \\mathrm{ms}$ is considered prolonged. The patient's value of $492 \\, \\mathrm{ms}$ is significantly above this threshold, indicating marked baseline QT prolongation.\n\nCitalopram is a medication known to cause dose-dependent prolongation of the QT interval. Initiating this drug in a $78$-year-old woman with a baseline $QTc$ of $492 \\, \\mathrm{ms}$ would confer a substantial risk of inducing further prolongation, potentially leading to the life-threatening arrhythmia torsades de pointes. Therefore, based on the calculation and widely accepted safety guidelines, initiating citalopram would require, at a minimum, limiting the daily dose (e.g., to the FDA-recommended maximum of $20 \\, \\mathrm{mg}$/day for patients over $60$), alongside careful cardiac monitoring. Consideration of alternative therapeutic agents that do not carry this risk would also be clinically indicated. The interpretation is that limiting the dose is a mandatory safety measure.",
