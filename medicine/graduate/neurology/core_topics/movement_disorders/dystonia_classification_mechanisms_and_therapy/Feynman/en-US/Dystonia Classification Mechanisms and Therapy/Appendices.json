            "problem": "A single-pulse Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) experiment is performed over the primary motor cortex during a tonic voluntary contraction to probe intracortical inhibition in a musician with task-specific focal hand dystonia (adult-onset, focal, task-specific dystonia) and in an age-matched healthy control. The cortical silent period (CSP) is defined operationally as the interval from the onset of the motor-evoked potential (MEP) to the first sustained return of voluntary electromyographic (EMG) activity. You record $6$ artifact-free trials per participant at $130\\%$ of resting motor threshold during a stable contraction of approximately $20\\%$ of maximal voluntary contraction.\n\nFor each trial you identify the MEP onset time and the EMG resumption time, both referenced to the TMS pulse ($t=0$).

            "solution": "The problem requires the calculation of the inhibitory time constant, $\\tau_{\\mathrm{dys}}$, for a participant with dystonia, based on data from a Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) experiment. The solution proceeds in two main stages: first, the determination of the mean cortical silent period (CSP) from the provided trial data, and second, the application of a given biophysical model to relate this mean CSP to the time constant.\n\nFirst, we must calculate the duration of the cortical silent period, $T_{\\mathrm{CSP}}$, for each of the $6$ trials for the dystonia participant. The problem defines the CSP as the interval from the onset of the motor-evoked potential (MEP) to the return of voluntary electromyographic (EMG) activity. Let $t_{\\mathrm{MEP}}$ be the MEP onset time and $t_{\\mathrm{EMG}}$ be the EMG resumption time, both referenced to the TMS pulse at $t=0$. The CSP duration for a given trial is therefore $T_{\\mathrm{CSP}} = t_{\\mathrm{EMG}} - t_{\\mathrm{MEP}}$.\n\nThe trial data for the dystonia participant are:\n- Trial $1$: $t_{\\mathrm{MEP},1} = 22 \\text{ ms}$, $t_{\\mathrm{EMG},1} = 118 \\text{ ms}$. Thus, $T_{\\mathrm{CSP},1} = 118 - 22 = 96 \\text{ ms}$.\n- Trial $2$: $t_{\\mathrm{MEP},2} = 21 \\text{ ms}$, $t_{\\mathrm{EMG},2} = 119 \\text{ ms}$. Thus, $T_{\\mathrm{CSP},2} = 119 - 21 = 98 \\text{ ms}$.\n- Trial $3$: $t_{\\mathrm{MEP},3} = 23 \\text{ ms}$, $t_{\\mathrm{EMG},3} = 120 \\text{ ms}$. Thus, $T_{\\mathrm{CSP},3} = 120 - 23 = 97 \\text{ ms}$.\n- Trial $4$: $t_{\\mathrm{MEP},4} = 22 \\text{ ms}$, $t_{\\mathrm{EMG},4} = 115 \\text{ ms}$. Thus, $T_{\\mathrm{CSP},4} = 115 - 22 = 93 \\text{ ms}$.\n- Trial $5$: $t_{\\mathrm{MEP},5} = 22 \\text{ ms}$, $t_{\\mathrm{EMG},5} = 121 \\text{ ms}$. Thus, $T_{\\mathrm{CSP},5} = 121 - 22 = 99 \\text{ ms}$.\n- Trial $6$: $t_{\\mathrm{MEP},6} = 21 \\text{ ms}$, $t_{\\mathrm{EMG},6} = 116 \\text{ ms}$. Thus, $T_{\\mathrm{CSP},6} = 116 - 21 = 95 \\text{ ms}$.\n\nThe next step is to compute the mean CSP duration for the dystonia participant, denoted as $\\overline{T}_{\\mathrm{CSP,dys}}$. This is the arithmetic mean of the individual trial durations.\n$$\n\\overline{T}_{\\mathrm{CSP,dys}} = \\frac{1}{6} \\sum_{i=1}^{6} T_{\\mathrm{CSP},i}\n$$\n$$\n\\overline{T}_{\\mathrm{CSP,dys}} = \\frac{96 + 98 + 97 + 93 + 99 + 95}{6} \\text{ ms} = \\frac{578}{6} \\text{ ms} \\approx 96.333... \\text{ ms}\n$$\nIt is prudent to retain the exact fractional form $\\frac{578}{6}$ for intermediate calculations to avoid rounding errors.\n\nThe second stage of the problem involves the provided biophysical model. The net cortical inhibitory drive is modeled as an exponentially decaying current $I(t) = I_{0}\\exp(-t/\\tau)$, where $t$ is the time elapsed after the MEP onset. Voluntary EMG activity resumes when this inhibitory current $I(t)$ decays to a fixed threshold value $I_{\\mathrm{th}}$. This resumption occurs at time $t = T_{\\mathrm{CSP}}$. We use the mean value $\\overline{T}_{\\mathrm{CSP,dys}}$ as the representative time for this event.\n\nTherefore, the condition for EMG resumption is:\n$$\nI(\\overline{T}_{\\mathrm{CSP,dys}}) = I_{\\mathrm{th}}\n$$\nSubstituting the expression for $I(t)$ into this condition, with the time constant for the dystonia participant being $\\tau_{\\mathrm{dys}}$, we get:\n$$\nI_{0}\\exp(-\\overline{T}_{\\mathrm{CSP,dys}} / \\tau_{\\mathrm{dys}}) = I_{\\mathrm{th}}\n$$\nWe can rearrange this equation to isolate the exponential term:\n$$\n\\exp(-\\overline{T}_{\\mathrm{CSP,dys}} / \\tau_{\\mathrm{dys}}) = \\frac{I_{\\mathrm{th}}}{I_{0}}\n$$\nThe problem provides the ratio $I_{0}/I_{\\mathrm{th}} = 4.5$. This implies that the ratio $I_{\\mathrm{th}}/I_{0} = 1/4.5$. Substituting this value:\n$$\n\\exp(-\\overline{T}_{\\mathrm{CSP,dys}} / \\tau_{\\mathrm{dys}}) = \\frac{1}{4.5}\n$$\nTo solve for $\\tau_{\\mathrm{dys}}$, we take the natural logarithm of both sides:\n$$\n\\ln\\left(\\exp(-\\overline{T}_{\\mathrm{CSP,dys}} / \\tau_{\\mathrm{dys}})\\right) = \\ln\\left(\\frac{1}{4.5}\\right)\n$$\n$$\n-\\frac{\\overline{T}_{\\mathrm{CSP,dys}}}{\\tau_{\\mathrm{dys}}} = -\\ln(4.5)\n$$\nMultiplying by $-1$ and rearranging to solve for $\\tau_{\\mathrm{dys}}$:\n$$\n\\tau_{\\mathrm{dys}} = \\frac{\\overline{T}_{\\mathrm{CSP,dys}}}{\\ln(4.5)}\n$$\nNow, we substitute the calculated value of $\\overline{T}_{\\mathrm{CSP,dys}} = \\frac{578}{6}$ ms:\n$$\n\\tau_{\\mathrm{dys}} = \\frac{578/6}{\\ln(4.5)} \\text{ ms}\n$$\nUsing the numerical values:\n$$\n\\tau_{\\mathrm{dys}} \\approx \\frac{96.33333...}{\\ln(4.5)} \\approx \\frac{96.33333...}{1.5040773967...} \\approx 64.04830... \\text{ ms}\n$$\nThe problem requires the final answer to be rounded to four significant figures.

The fifth significant digit is $8$, which is greater than or equal to $5$, so we round up the fourth digit.\n$$\n\\tau_{\\mathrm{dys}} \\approx 64.05 \\text{ ms}\n$$\nThe data for the healthy control participant are superfluous for the requested calculation.",

To balance efficacy and diffusion-related adverse events (for example, dysphagia from spread out of the sternocleidomastoid), you will use two vials that are reconstituted to different concentrations and allocated to specific muscles as follows.\n\nMuscle targets, desired dose per muscle, planned number of injection sites per muscle, and the maximum allowable volume per site to mitigate diffusion risk are:\n- Right sternocleidomastoid: dose $60$ units, $4$ sites, maximum per-site volume $0.20$ mL.\n- Right anterior scalene: dose $10$ units, $2$ sites, maximum per-site volume $0.15$ mL.\n- Right levator scapulae: dose $30$ units, $2$ sites, maximum per-site volume $0.30$ mL.\n- Left splenius capitis: dose $70$ units, $4$ sites, maximum per-site volume $0.40$ mL.\n- Trapezius (treated as a single functional target across its involved segments): dose $30$ units, $3$ sites, maximum per-site volume $0.50$ mL.\n\nYou will reconstitute and allocate the two $100$-unit vials as follows:\n- Vial A supplies the right sternocleidomastoid, right anterior scalene, and right levator scapulae.\n- Vial B supplies the left splenius capitis and trapezius.\n\nTo adjust for diffusion risk in a principled way, follow these rules:\n- For Vial A (higher diffusion-risk group), choose the concentration so that the per-site injection volume in the most constrained of its muscles is exactly equal to that muscle’s allowed per-site maximum volume.\n- For Vial B (lower diffusion-risk group), choose the concentration to be the minimal value that still ensures that all its muscles meet their respective per-site maximum volume constraints.\n\nAssume all $100$ units from each vial are used exactly as allocated above.

The constraint for each muscle is $v \\le V_{\\text{max}}$, which can be rewritten as $C \\ge D / (N \\times V_{\\text{max}})$.\n\n**Analysis of Vial A**\n\nVial A contains $100$ units and supplies the right sternocleidomastoid (RSM), right anterior scalene (RAS), and right levator scapulae (RLS). The total dose is $60 + 10 + 30 = 100$ units, which is consistent.\nThe rule for Vial A is to set its concentration, $C_A$, such that the per-site volume for the \"most constrained\" muscle is exactly equal to its maximum allowed volume.
