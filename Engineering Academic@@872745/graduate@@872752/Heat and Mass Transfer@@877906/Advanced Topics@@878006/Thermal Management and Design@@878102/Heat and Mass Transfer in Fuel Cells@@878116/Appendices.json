The reversible cell potential, $E_{\\text{rev}}$, can therefore be expressed as:\n$$ E_{\\mathrm{rev}} = -\\frac{\\Delta G}{nF} $$\nThe quantity of interest is the temperature coefficient of the reversible cell potential at constant pressure, which is the derivative of $E_{\\text{rev}}$ with respect to temperature $T$:\n$$ \\left(\\frac{\\partial E_{\\mathrm{rev}}}{\\partial T}\\right)_{p} = -\\frac{1}{nF} \\left(\\frac{\\partial (\\Delta G)}{\\partial T}\\right)_{p} $$\nFrom fundamental thermodynamics, the Maxwell relations provide the temperature dependence of the Gibbs free energy at constant pressure. The Gibbs equation is $dG = Vdp - SdT$. At constant pressure ($dp = 0$), this simplifies to $dG = -SdT$, which implies the identity:\n$$ \\left(\\frac{\\partial G}{\\partial T}\\right)_{p} = -S $$\nThis relation applies equally to the change in Gibbs free energy and entropy for a chemical reaction:\n$$ \\left(\\frac{\\partial (\\Delta G)}{\\partial T}\\right)_{p} = \\Delta \\left(\\frac{\\partial G}{\\partial T}\\right)_{p} = -\\Delta S $$\nwhere $\\Delta S$ is the change in entropy for the reaction.\n\nSubstituting this result back into the expression for the temperature coefficient yields the Gibbs-Helmholtz relation for electrochemical cells:\n$$ \\left(\\frac{\\partial E_{\\mathrm{rev}}}{\\partial T}\\right)_{p} = -\\frac{1}{nF} (-\\Delta S) = \\frac{\\Delta S}{nF} $$\nThis equation is the required expression.

Derivation of Governing Equations**\n\nThe foundation of this model rests on two principles: local charge conservation and Ohm's law for conduction in porous media.\n\nFirst, consider the principle of charge conservation at steady state. In one dimension, this states that the spatial derivative of the current density in a given phase must equal the volumetric source or sink of charge in that phase.\n$$\n\\frac{di}{dx} = j_{\\mathrm{transfer}}\n$$\nwhere $i$ is the current density and $j_{\\mathrm{transfer}}$ is the volumetric transfer current density. The problem specifies a uniform oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) throughout the catalyst layer, represented by a constant volumetric current density $i_{\\mathrm{v}}$. The ORR consumes electrons from the solid phase and protons from the electrolyte phase.\n\nThe reaction is $O_2 + 4H^+ + 4e^- \\rightarrow 2H_2O$.\n- For the solid phase, electrons ($e^-$) are consumed. The flow of electrons constitutes an electrical current. By convention, current flows in the direction of positive charge movement. An electron flow into the reaction site corresponds to a conventional current flowing *out* of the reaction site. Thus, the reaction acts as a source of current for the solid phase. The conservation equation is:\n$$\n\\frac{di_{\\mathrm{s}}}{dx} = i_{\\mathrm{v}}\n$$\n- For the electrolyte phase, protons ($H^+$), which are positive charges, are consumed. A flow of protons into the reaction site is a current into the reaction site. Thus, the reaction acts as a sink of current for the electrolyte phase. The conservation equation is:\n$$\n\\frac{di_{\\mathrm{m}}}{dx} = -i_{\\mathrm{v}}\n$$\nWe can verify overall charge neutrality. The total current density is $i_{\\mathrm{total}}(x) = i_{\\mathrm{s}}(x) + i_{\\mathrm{m}}(x)$. Its divergence must be zero, as charge is only transferred between phases, not created or destroyed.\n$$\n\\frac{di_{\\mathrm{total}}}{dx} = \\frac{d}{dx}(i_{\\mathrm{s}} + i_{\\mathrm{m}}) = \\frac{di_{\\mathrm{s}}}{dx} + \\frac{di_{\\mathrm{m}}}{dx} = i_{\\mathrm{v}} - i_{\\mathrm{v}} = 0\n$$\nThis confirms that our source term assignments are consistent.\n\nNext, we apply Ohm's law for porous media, which relates the current density to the potential gradient in each phase:\n$$\ni_{\\mathrm{s}}(x) = -\\sigma_{\\mathrm{s}}\\frac{d\\phi_{\\mathrm{s}}}{dx}\n$$\n$$\ni_{\\mathrm{m}}(x) = -\\kappa_{\\mathrm{m}}\\frac{d\\phi_{\\mathrm{m}}}{dx}\n$$\nwhere $\\sigma_{\\mathrm{s}}$ and $\\kappa_{\\mathrm{m}}$ are the effective conductivities.\n\nSubstituting these expressions into the conservation equations yields the governing second-order ordinary differential equations (ODEs) for the potentials:\n- For the solid phase potential, $\\phi_{\\mathrm{s}}(x)$:\n$$\n\\frac{d}{dx} \\left( -\\sigma_{\\mathrm{s}}\\frac{d\\phi_{\\mathrm{s}}}{dx} \\right) = i_{\\mathrm{v}}\n$$\nAssuming $\\sigma_{\\mathrm{s}}$ is constant, we obtain:\n$$\n\\frac{d^2\\phi_{\\mathrm{s}}}{dx^2} = -\\frac{i_{\\mathrm{v}}}{\\sigma_{\\mathrm{s}}}\n$$\n- For the electrolyte phase potential, $\\phi_{\\mathrm{m}}(x)$:\n$$\n\\frac{d}{dx} \\left( -\\kappa_{\\mathrm{m}}\\frac{d\\phi_{\\mathrm{m}}}{dx} \\right) = -i_{\\mathrm{v}}\n$$\nAssuming $\\kappa_{\\mathrm{m}}$ is constant, we obtain:\n$$\n\\frac{d^2\\phi_{\\mathrm{m}}}{dx^2} = \\frac{i_{\\mathrm{v}}}{\\kappa_{\\mathrm{m}}}\n$$\nThese two Poisson equations are the governing equations for the system.\n\n**2. Boundary Value Problem**\n\nThe problem is completely specified by the two ODEs and the four provided boundary conditions:\n1.  $\\phi_{\\mathrm{s}}(0) = 0$: The solid potential is set to a reference of $0 \\, \\mathrm{V}$ at the interface with the gas diffusion layer (GDL).\n2.  $\\dfrac{d\\phi_{\\mathrm{s}}}{dx}\\bigg|_{x=L} = 0$: The electronic current into the purely ionic-conducting membrane is zero, i.e., $i_{\\mathrm{s}}(L) = 0$.\n3.  $\\dfrac{d\\phi_{\\mathrm{m}}}{dx}\\bigg|_{x=0} = 0$: The protonic current into the purely electronic-conducting GDL is zero, i.e., $i_{\\mathrm{m}}(0) = 0$.\n4.  $\\phi_{\\mathrm{m}}(L) = 0$: The membrane potential is set to a reference of $0 \\, \\mathrm{V}$ at the interface with the membrane.\n\n**3.
