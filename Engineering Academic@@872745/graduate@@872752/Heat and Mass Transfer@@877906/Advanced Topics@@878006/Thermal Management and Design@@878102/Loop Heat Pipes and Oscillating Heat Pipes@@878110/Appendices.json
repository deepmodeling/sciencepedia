The $2\\%$ settling time $t_s$ is determined by finding the last time point at which the response $\\Delta T(t)$ is outside the band $[0.98 \\Delta T_{\\infty}, 1.02 \\Delta T_{\\infty}]$.\n\nThis approach avoids using analytical formulas for overshoot or settling time, which depend on the system being a standard second-order system with zero initial velocity, a condition not met here as $\\frac{d\\Delta T}{dt}(0^+) = \\frac{\\Delta Q}{C_{ev}} \\neq 0$. The state-space simulation correctly captures the system's full dynamics.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy.linalg import expm\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves the LHP transient response problem for a suite of test cases.\n    \"\"\"\n    test_cases = [\n        # Case A: Moderately underdamped\n        (400, 1.3e6, 1.8e4, 1.0e7, 1.0e6, 20, 100, 300),\n        # Case B: Near critically damped\n        (400, 1.3e6, 1.8e4, 1.5e7, 1.0e6, 20, 100, 300),\n        # Case C: Overdamped\n        (400, 1.3e6, 1.8e4, 3.0e7, 1.0e6, 20, 100, 300),\n        # Case D: Lightly damped\n        (400, 1.3e6, 1.8e4, 2.0e6, 1.0e6, 20, 100, 300),\n    ]\n\n    all_results = []\n    for case in test_cases:\n        C_ev, h_fg, K_p, R, L, G_l, dQ, _ = case\n\n        # 1.
