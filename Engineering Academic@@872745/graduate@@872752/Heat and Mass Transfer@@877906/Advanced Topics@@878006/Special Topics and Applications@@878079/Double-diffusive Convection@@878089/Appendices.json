For such an eigenfunction, the operator $D^2$ acts as multiplication by $-(n\\pi)^2$.

Since $\\mathrm{Ra}_T$ is an increasing function of $n^2$, the minimum occurs for the smallest possible integer value, which is $n=1$. The marginal stability curve for the primary mode is therefore:\n$$ \\mathrm{Ra}_T(k) = \\mathrm{Le}\\,\\mathrm{Ra}_S + \\frac{(\\pi^2 + k^2)^2}{k^2} $$\nTo perform a long-wavelength expansion for small $k \\to 0$, we expand the expression for $\\mathrm{Ra}_T(k)$.

This corresponds to retaining the two leading terms in the Laurent series as $k \\to 0$, which are the terms of order $k^{-2}$ and $k^0$. These are dominant in the long-wavelength limit.\nThus, the approximation is:\n$$ \\mathrm{Ra}_T(k) \\approx \\frac{\\pi^4}{k^2} + 2\\pi^2 + \\mathrm{Le}\\,\\mathrm{Ra}_S $$\nThis expression provides the asymptotic behavior of the marginal stability curve for large-scale convection cells.\n\nFor the physical interpretation of the $k^0$ correction, we examine the constant term in the expansion, which is $(2\\pi^2 + \\mathrm{Le}\\,\\mathrm{Ra}_S)$. The term $\\mathrm{Le}\\,\\mathrm{Ra}_S$ represents the contribution of the solute field. The problem specifies that the concentration is higher at the bottom plate and that $\\beta_S  0$, implying the solute makes the fluid denser. This constitutes a stabilizing density gradient. Consequently, the solutal Rayleigh number $\\mathrm{Ra}_S$ is positive. The Lewis number $\\mathrm{Le}$ is also positive. Therefore, the product $\\mathrm{Le}\\,\\mathrm{Ra}_S$ is a positive quantity that adds to the required thermal Rayleigh number $\\mathrm{Ra}_T$ to initiate convection. This signifies a stabilizing effect of the solute field. The fact that this term is of order $k^0$ indicates that this stabilizing influence is present for all modes, including those of very long wavelength ($k \\to 0$), and its magnitude to this order of approximation does not depend on the spatial scale of the convection cells. It represents a bulk resistance to overturning that must be overcome by thermal buoyancy, in addition to the effects of thermal diffusion and the geometric constraints of the layer.", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{\\frac{\\pi^4}{k^2} + 2\\pi^2 + \\mathrm{Le}\\,\\mathrm{Ra}_{S}} $$", "id": "2478630"}, {"introduction": "Linear stability analysis predicts the onset of convection but implies unending exponential growth, which is physically unrealistic.

The stability is therefore limited by the condition $G \\ge -1$:\n$$\n1 - \\frac{4 \\kappa_{S} \\Delta t}{(\\Delta x)^2} \\sum_{i=1}^{d} \\sin^2\\left(\\frac{k_i \\Delta x}{2}\\right) \\ge -1\n$$\n$$\n2 \\ge \\frac{4 \\kappa_{S} \\Delta t}{(\\Delta x)^2} \\sum_{i=1}^{d} \\sin^2\\left(\\frac{k_i \\Delta x}{2}\\right)\n$$\nRearranging for $\\Delta t$:\n$$\n\\Delta t \\le \\frac{2 (\\Delta x)^2}{4 \\kappa_{S} \\sum_{i=1}^{d} \\sin^2\\left(\\frac{k_i \\Delta x}{2}\\right)} = \\frac{(\\Delta x)^2}{2 \\kappa_{S} \\sum_{i=1}^{d} \\sin^2\\left(\\frac{k_i \\Delta x}{2}\\right)}\n$$\nThis condition must hold for all wavenumbers $k_i$. The most restrictive (smallest) upper bound on $\\Delta t$ occurs when the denominator is maximized. The term $\\sum_{i=1}^{d} \\sin^2(k_i \\Delta x / 2)$ is maximized for the highest frequency modes resolvable on the grid, which correspond to a wavelength of $2 \\Delta x$. For these modes, $k_i = \\pi / \\Delta x$, so $k_i \\Delta x = \\pi$. This yields $\\sin^2(\\pi/2) = 1$. The maximum value of the sum is achieved when these high-frequency modes exist in all $d$ directions simultaneously, giving $\\sum_{i=1}^{d} 1 = d$.\nSubstituting this maximum value into the inequality gives the stability criterion:\n$$\n\\Delta t_{\\max} \\le \\frac{(\\Delta x)^2}{2 \\kappa_{S} d}\n$$\nComparing this to the form $\\Delta t_{\\max} \\le c\\,\\Delta x^{2}/\\kappa_{S}$, we identify the constant $c$ as:\n$$\nc = \\frac{1}{2d}\n$$\n\n### Part 2: Numerical Calculation of $\\Delta t_{\\max}$\n\nFor a three-dimensional simulation ($d=3$), the constant $c$ is:\n$$\nc = \\frac{1}{2(3)} = \\frac{1}{6}\n$$\nThe maximum stable time step is thus $\\Delta t_{\\max} = \\frac{1}{6} \\frac{(\\Delta x)^2}{\\kappa_S}$.\n\nNext, we calculate the grid spacing $\\Delta x$. The salt fingers of diameter $\\lambda_f = 1.0 \\mathrm{cm}$ must be resolved by $N_p = 12$ grid points.\nFirst, convert units to SI:\n$\\lambda_f = 1.0 \\mathrm{cm} = 1.0 \\times 10^{-2} \\mathrm{m}$.\n$$\n\\Delta x = \\frac{\\lambda_f}{N_p} = \\frac{1.0 \\times 10^{-2} \\mathrm{m}}{12}\n$$\nThe solutal diffusivity is given as $\\kappa_S = 1.0 \\times 10^{-9} \\mathrm{m^2 s^{-1}}$.\nNow, we can compute $\\Delta t_{\\max}$:\n$$\n\\Delta t_{\\max} = \\frac{1}{6} \\frac{\\left( \\frac{1.0 \\times 10^{-2}}{12} \\right)^2}{1.0 \\times 10^{-9}}\\ \\mathrm{s}\n= \\frac{1}{6} \\frac{(1.0 \\times 10^{-4}) / 144}{1.0 \\times 10^{-9}}\\ \\mathrm{s}\n= \\frac{1}{6 \\times 144} \\frac{1.0 \\times 10^{-4}}{1.0 \\times 10^{-9}}\\ \\mathrm{s}\n$$\n$$\n\\Delta t_{\\max} = \\frac{1}{864} \\times 10^5\\ \\mathrm{s} = \\frac{100000}{864}\\ \\mathrm{s} \\approx 115.7407\\dots\\ \\mathrm{s}\n$$\nRounding to three significant figures, we get:\n$$\n\\Delta t_{\\max} \\approx 116\\ \\mathrm{s}\n$$\n\n### Part 3: Qualitative Discussion\n\nThe problem of simulating double-diffusive convection in the large Lewis number regime, particularly when needing to resolve fine structures like salt fingers, presents significant computational challenges. These challenges are made clear by the stability criterion derived for the explicit FTCS scheme applied to the salinity equation: $\\Delta t_{\\max} \\le \\frac{1}{2d} \\frac{(\\Delta x)^2}{\\kappa_S}$.\n\n1.  **Influence of Spatial Resolution ($\\Delta x$)**: Salt fingers are thin, filamentary structures. To accurately capture their dynamics, a high spatial resolution, and thus a small grid spacing $\\Delta x$, is required. The stability criterion shows that $\\Delta t_{\\max}$ is proportional to $(\\Delta x)^2$. This quadratic dependence is punitive: halving the grid spacing to improve resolution requires reducing the time step by a factor of four to maintain numerical stability. The need to resolve the small-scale physics of salt fingers directly imposes a very restrictive condition on the time step.\n\n2.  **Influence of Solutal Diffusivity ($\\kappa_S$)**: The maximum time step $\\Delta t_{\\max}$ is inversely proportional to the solutal diffusivity $\\kappa_S$. Physically, diffusion is a slow process for salt in water, meaning $\\kappa_S$ is a very small number ($10^{-9} \\mathrm{m^2 s^{-1}}$ in this case). This small value in the denominator of the stability criterion makes $\\Delta t_{\\max}$ correspondingly small. The numerical time step must be smaller than the characteristic time for salt to diffuse across a single grid cell, a timescale which is on the order of $(\\Delta x)^2 / \\kappa_S$. The slow physical diffusion of salt ironically leads to a fast numerical instability, demanding a very short time step for an explicit scheme.\n\n3.  **Influence of Large Lewis Number ($Le$)**: The Lewis number, $Le = \\kappa_T / \\kappa_S$, being much greater than $1$ signifies a large disparity between the rapid diffusion of heat and the slow diffusion of salt ($\\kappa_T \\gg \\kappa_S$). This disparity is the fundamental reason salt fingers form. The characteristic width of these fingers is determined by the balance of forces and diffusion, and is intrinsically linked to the smaller diffusivity, $\\kappa_S$. Therefore, the large-$Le$ regime is precisely the regime where fine spatial structures tied to the slower diffusing component exist.\n    This creates a classic numerical stiffness problem. An explicit scheme for the temperature equation would be constrained by $\\Delta t \\le c (\\Delta x)^2/\\kappa_T$, while the salinity equation is constrained by $\\Delta t \\le c (\\Delta x)^2/\\kappa_S$. Since $\\kappa_T \\gg \\kappa_S$, the salinity constraint is far more restrictive. The simulation's overall time step is bottlenecked by the component that diffuses the slowest but also creates the finest structures. The problem statement wisely indicates an unconditionally stable implicit solver for temperature, which circumvents the thermal diffusion time step limit. However, the use of an explicit solver for the salinity equation means the simulation is still limited by the very small $\\Delta t_{\\max}$ dictated by $\\kappa_S$ and the small $\\Delta x$ needed to resolve the salt fingers. In summary, the combination of large $Le$ (creating fine structures) and an explicit numerical method for the slow-diffusing component (salt) leads to extremely demanding computational costs due to the severe time step constraint.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{116}$$", "id": "2478607"}]}
