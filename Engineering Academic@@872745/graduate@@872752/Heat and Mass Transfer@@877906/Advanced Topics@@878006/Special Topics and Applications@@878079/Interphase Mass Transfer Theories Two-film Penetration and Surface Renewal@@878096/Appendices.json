A crucial first step is to use the calibration condition to relate the parameters of the two models.\n\n**1. Calibration of Models (No Reaction, $k_1=0$)**\n\nFor physical absorption without reaction, the molar flux $N_A$ is given by $N_A = k_L (C_{A,i} - C_{A,bulk})$. Assuming the bulk liquid concentration of $A$ is zero ($C_{A,bulk}=0$), this simplifies to $N_A = k_L C_{A,i}$.\n\n- **Two-Film Theory:** Transport is by steady-state diffusion across a stagnant film of thickness $\\delta$. The flux is governed by Fick's first law: $N_A = \\frac{D}{\\delta} C_{A,i}$.

The average flux across the interface, considering the exponential age distribution of surface elements $p(t) = s e^{-st}$, is given by $N_A = C_{A,i} \\sqrt{Ds}$.

Comparison of the Two Theories**\n\nTo compare the two models under the given conditions, we must express $E_{film}$ in terms of the same parameters as $E_{Danckwerts}$. Using the calibration result $\\delta = \\sqrt{D/s}$, we can rewrite the Hatta number from the film theory:\n$$Ha = \\sqrt{\\frac{k_1 \\delta^2}{D}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{k_1 (D/s)}{D}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{k_1}{s}}$$\nThus, we are comparing the following two functions of the dimensionless group $Ha = \\sqrt{k_1/s}$:\n$$E_{film} = \\frac{Ha}{\\tanh(Ha)}$$\n$$E_{Danckwerts} = \\sqrt{1 + Ha^2}$$\n\nFor any finite, positive reaction rate ($k_1 > 0$), we have $Ha > 0$. It is a well-established mathematical inequality that for any $x>0$, $\\tanh(x) > \\frac{x}{\\sqrt{1+x^2}}$. This can be proven by analyzing the function $f(x) = \\tanh(x) - x/\\sqrt{1+x^2}$ and its derivatives. This inequality is equivalent to $\\sqrt{1+x^2} > \\frac{x}{\\tanh(x)}$. Therefore, for any $Ha > 0$:\n$$E_{Danckwerts} > E_{film}$$\nThis means the surface renewal theory consistently predicts a higher enhancement factor than the two-film theory for any non-zero reaction rate.\n\n**5.

Both predictions asymptotically coincide in this limit as well.\n\n**Option-by-Option Analysis**\n\n- **A. For the same $k_1$, $D$, and $s$, both theories predict identical $E$ for all conditions.**\n  This is **Incorrect**. The functional forms $Ha/\\tanh(Ha)$ and $\\sqrt{1+Ha^2}$ are not identical for $Ha > 0$.\n\n- **B.

Applying the transform to the governing equation yields:\n$$\np\\bar{C}(y,p) - C(y,0) = D \\frac{d^2 \\bar{C}(y,p)}{d y^2} - k_1 \\bar{C}(y,p)\n$$\nUsing the initial condition $C(y,0) = 0$, the equation simplifies to an ordinary differential equation in $y$:\n$$\nD \\frac{d^2 \\bar{C}}{d y^2} - (p+k_1)\\bar{C} = 0\n$$\nThe general solution to this second-order ODE is:\n$$\n\\bar{C}(y,p) = A_1 \\exp\\left(y\\sqrt{\\frac{p+k_1}{D}}\\right) + A_2 \\exp\\left(-y\\sqrt{\\frac{p+k_1}{D}}\\right)\n$$\nThe boundary conditions in the Laplace domain are $\\bar{C}(y=0,p) = \\mathcal{L}\\{C_i\\} = \\frac{C_i}{p}$ and $\\bar{C}(y \\to \\infty,p) \\to 0$. The second boundary condition requires that the coefficient $A_1$ must be zero to ensure the concentration remains bounded. Thus, $A_1=0$. Applying the first boundary condition at $y=0$ gives:\n$$\n\\bar{C}(0,p) = A_2 = \\frac{C_i}{p}\n$$\nThe solution for the concentration profile in the Laplace domain is therefore:\n$$\n\\bar{C}(y,p) = \\frac{C_i}{p} \\exp\\left(-y\\sqrt{\\frac{p+k_1}{D}}\\right)\n$$\nThe instantaneous molar flux into the liquid at the interface ($y=0$) for an element of age $\\theta$ is given by Fick's first law, $N(\\theta) = -D \\left.\\frac{\\partial C}{\\partial y}\\right|_{y=0}$. We first find the derivative of the concentration profile in the Laplace domain:\n$$\n\\frac{d\\bar{C}}{dy} = \\frac{C_i}{p} \\left(-\\sqrt{\\frac{p+k_1}{D}}\\right) \\exp\\left(-y\\sqrt{\\frac{p+k_1}{D}}\\right)\n$$\nEvaluating this at the interface $y=0$:\n$$\n\\left.\\frac{d\\bar{C}}{dy}\\right|_{y=0} = -\\frac{C_i}{p} \\sqrt{\\frac{p+k_1}{D}}\n$$\nThe Laplace transform of the instantaneous flux, $\\bar{N}(p) = \\mathcal{L}_{\\theta}\\{N(\\theta)\\}$, is:\n$$\n\\bar{N}(p) = -D \\left.\\frac{d\\bar{C}}{dy}\\right|_{y=0} = -D \\left(-\\frac{C_i}{p} \\sqrt{\\frac{p+k_1}{D}}\\right) = C_i \\frac{\\sqrt{D(p+k_1)}}{p}\n$$\nAccording to the Danckwerts surface renewal model, the steady-state, area-averaged molar flux, $N_{avg}$, is obtained by averaging the instantaneous flux $N(\\theta)$ over the exponential age distribution of surface elements, $\\phi(\\theta) = s \\exp(-s\\theta)$, where $s$ is the surface renewal rate.\n$$\nN_{avg} = \\int_0^\\infty N(\\theta) \\phi(\\theta) d\\theta = \\int_0^\\infty N(\\theta) s \\exp(-s\\theta) d\\theta\n$$\nA fundamental property of the Laplace transform is that this integral is equivalent to $s \\bar{N}(s)$. Therefore, we can find the average flux directly without performing the inverse Laplace transform and integration:\n$$\nN_{avg} = s \\left.\\bar{N}(p)\\right|_{p=s} = s \\left( C_i \\frac{\\sqrt{D(s+k_1)}}{s} \\right) = C_i \\sqrt{D(s+k_1)}\n$$\nThe liquid-side mass transfer coefficient, $k_L$, is defined by the relation $N_{avg} = k_L (C_i - C_{bulk})$. Given that fresh liquid elements have zero solute concentration, the bulk concentration $C_{bulk}$ is taken as zero. Thus, $N_{avg} = k_L C_i$.\nBy comparing the two expressions for $N_{avg}$, we identify the expression for the mass transfer coefficient:\n$$\nk_L = \\sqrt{D(s+k_1)}\n$$\nThis is the general expression for the mass transfer coefficient under Danckwerts' surface renewal model for a pseudo-first-order reaction.\n\nNow, we apply this result to the two experiments performed under identical hydrodynamic conditions (i.e., the same renewal rate $s$).\n\n1.  For physical absorption (no reaction), $k_1 = 0$. The measured mass transfer coefficient is $k_L^{(0)}$.\n    $$\n    k_L^{(0)} = \\sqrt{D(s+0)} = \\sqrt{Ds}\n    $$\n2.  For reactive absorption, the reaction rate constant is $k_1 > 0$. The measured mass transfer coefficient is $k_L^{(R)}$.\n    $$\n    k_L^{(R)} = \\sqrt{D(s+k_1)}\n    $$\nWe have a system of two equations with two unknowns, $s$ and $k_1$. We are tasked to find $k_1$. Let us square both equations to eliminate the square roots:\n$$\n(k_L^{(0)})^2 = Ds \\quad (1)\n$$\n$$\n(k_L^{(R)})^2 = D(s+k_1) = Ds + Dk_1 \\quad (2)\n$$\nSubstitute equation (1) into equation (2):\n$$\n(k_L^{(R)})^2 = (k_L^{(0)})^2 + Dk_1\n$$\nSolving for the reaction rate constant $k_1$:\n$$\nk_1 = \\frac{(k_L^{(R)})^2 - (k_L^{(0)})^2}{D}\n$$\nThis is the required symbolic expression. Now, we compute the numerical value using the provided data:\n$k_L^{(0)} = 4.50 \\times 10^{-5} \\ \\mathrm{m \\, s^{-1}}$\n$k_L^{(R)} = 1.10 \\times 10^{-4} \\ \\mathrm{m \\, s^{-1}}$\n$D = 1.90 \\times 10^{-9} \\ \\mathrm{m^2 \\, s^{-1}}$\n\nSubstituting these values into the expression for $k_1$:\n$$\nk_1 = \\frac{(1.10 \\times 10^{-4})^2 - (4.50 \\times 10^{-5})^2}{1.90 \\times 10^{-9}}\n$$\n$$\nk_1 = \\frac{1.21 \\times 10^{-8} - 0.2025 \\times 10^{-8}}{1.90 \\times 10^{-9}} = \\frac{(12.1 - 2.025) \\times 10^{-9}}{1.90 \\times 10^{-9}}\n$$\n$$\nk_1 = \\frac{10.075 \\times 10^{-9}}{1.90 \\times 10^{-9}} = \\frac{10.075}{1.90} \\approx 5.30263 \\ \\mathrm{s^{-1}}\n$$\nRounding the result to three significant figures, we obtain $k_1 = 5.30 \\ \\mathrm{s^{-1}}$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{5.30}$$", "id": "2496927"}]}
