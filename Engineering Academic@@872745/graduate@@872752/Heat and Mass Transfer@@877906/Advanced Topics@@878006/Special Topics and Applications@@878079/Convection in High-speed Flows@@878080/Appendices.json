A formal derivation and evaluation of options will proceed.\n\n### Derivation of the Condition for an Interior Temperature Maximum\n\nThe governing equation for thermal energy in a steady, two-dimensional, zero-pressure-gradient, compressible boundary layer, neglecting streamwise conduction and pressure work, is:\n$$\n\\rho c_p \\left( u \\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial x} + v \\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial y} \\right) = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y} \\left( k \\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial y} \\right) + \\mu \\left( \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial y} \\right)^2\n$$\nHere, $u$ and $v$ are the velocity components in the streamwise ($x$) and wall-normal ($y$) directions, respectively, $T$ is the temperature, and $\\rho$ is the density. The term on the left represents energy transport by convection. On the right, the first term is transverse heat conduction, and the second term is the viscous dissipation function, which represents the irreversible conversion of kinetic energy into internal energy due to viscous stresses and is always non-negative.\n\nAn interior temperature maximum at a location $y=y_m$ within the boundary layer is defined by the conditions:\n$$\n\\left. \\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial y} \\right|_{y=y_m} = 0 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\left. \\frac{\\partial^2 T}{\\partial y^2} \\right|_{y=y_m}  0\n$$\nThe wall is cooled, so heat is transferred from the fluid to the wall. This requires the temperature gradient at the wall to be positive:\n$$\n\\left. \\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial y} \\right|_{y=0}  0\n$$\nLet us examine the energy equation at the wall ($y=0$). Due to the no-slip ($u=0$) and no-penetration ($v=0$) conditions, the convective terms vanish. The energy equation simplifies to a balance between conduction and dissipation at the wall surface:\n$$\n\\left. k \\frac{\\partial^2 T}{\\partial y^2} \\right|_{y=0} + \\left. \\mu \\left( \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial y} \\right)^2 \\right|_{y=0} = 0\n$$\nRearranging for the curvature of the temperature profile at the wall gives:\n$$\n\\left. \\frac{\\partial^2 T}{\\partial y^2} \\right|_{y=0} = -\\frac{\\mu}{k} \\left( \\left. \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial y} \\right|_{y=0} \\right)^2\n$$\nSince $\\mu  0$, $k  0$, and $(\\partial u/\\partial y)^2 \\ge 0$ (and is strictly positive for a boundary layer flow), the temperature profile at the wall must be concave down: $\\left. \\frac{\\partial^2 T}{\\partial y^2} \\right|_{y=0}  0$.\n\nSo, the temperature profile starts at $T_w$ with a positive slope but is curved downwards. For the temperature to rise from $T_w$ to a maximum $T_{max}$ and then decrease to approach the edge temperature $T_e$, it is necessary that $T_{max}  T_e$. Such a \"temperature overshoot\" is only possible if there is a sufficiently strong internal heat source to overcome the cooling at the wall and the temperature deficit relative to the outer flow. This heat source is viscous dissipation.\n\nTo establish the condition for the existence of this maximum, we perform a scaling analysis to compare the magnitude of the heat generation by dissipation with the heat removal by conduction.\nThe volumetric rate of heat generation by viscous dissipation is:\n$$\n\\Phi = \\mu \\left( \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial y} \\right)^2 \\sim \\mu \\frac{U_e^2}{\\delta^2}\n$$\nwhere $\\delta$ is the characteristic thickness of the boundary layer.\nThe volumetric rate of heat removal by transverse conduction is driven by the temperature difference across the layer. The imposed temperature difference that conduction acts against is $(T_e-T_w)$. The scaling for the conduction term is:\n$$\n\\text{Conduction} \\sim k \\frac{\\partial^2 T}{\\partial y^2} \\sim k \\frac{T_e - T_w}{\\delta^2}\n$$\nAn interior temperature maximum becomes possible when the internal heat generation is dynamically comparable to or dominant over the capacity of transverse conduction (scaled by the wall-to-edge temperature difference) to remove this heat. This leads to the condition:\n$$\n\\mu \\frac{U_e^2}{\\delta^2} \\gtrsim k \\frac{T_e - T_w}{\\delta^2}\n$$\nThe boundary layer thickness $\\delta$ cancels, indicating that the condition for the existence of the maximum is a local balance and is independent of the downstream position $x$ (and thus of the Reynolds number $Re_x = \\rho U_e x / \\mu$, which governs $\\delta$). The condition simplifies to:\n$$\n\\frac{\\mu U_e^2}{k (T_e - T_w)} \\gtrsim O(1)\n$$\nThe dimensionless group on the left is the Brinkman number, $Br$. Using the provided definitions, we can also express this in terms of the Prandtl and Eckert numbers:\n$$\nBr = \\frac{\\mu c_p}{k} \\frac{U_e^2}{c_p (T_e - T_w)} = Pr \\cdot Ec \\gtrsim O(1)\n$$\nTherefore, the existence of an interior temperature maximum depends on the Brinkman number (or equivalently, the product of Prandtl and Eckert numbers) being sufficiently large.\n\nThe parameters involved are:\n-   **Brinkman number ($Br$), Prandtl number ($Pr$), and Eckert number ($Ec$)**: These are the primary governing parameters that set the existence criterion.\n-   **Mach number ($M_e$)**: The Eckert number can be expressed in terms of the Mach number as $Ec = (\\gamma-1) M_e^2 / (1 - T_w/T_e)$, where $\\gamma=c_p/c_v$. Thus, high $M_e$ directly leads to large $Ec$ and $Br$. The Mach number is also central to the definition of the recovery temperature $T_r$, which represents the potential for temperature rise due to dissipation.\n-   **Reynolds number ($Re_x$)**: This parameter determines the boundary layer thickness $\\delta \\sim x/\\sqrt{Re_x}$ and consequently affects the magnitude and location of the temperature peak, but it does not appear in the primary existence criterion $Br \\gtrsim 1$. Its role is secondary.\n\n### Evaluation of Options\n\n**A. For a cold wall with $T_w  T_e$, an interior temperature maximum can occur when viscous dissipation is dynamically comparable to or larger than transverse conduction relative to the imposed wall–edge temperature difference, i.e., when $Br = \\mu U_e^2/[k (T_e - T_w)]$ (equivalently $Pr \\, Ec$) is of order $O(1)$ or larger. The most relevant nondimensional parameters are $Pr$, $Ec$ (or $Br$), and $M_e$ through the recovery factor $r$ that sets $T_r$; the Reynolds number $Re_x$ enters only weakly through the boundary-layer thickness and does not set the existence of the maximum.**\n\n-   This statement accurately describes the physical mechanism (balance of dissipation and conduction), correctly identifies the governing parameter ($Br = Pr \\cdot Ec$), provides the correct criterion ($Br \\gtrsim O(1)$), correctly lists the key parameters ($Pr, Ec, M_e$), and correctly identifies the role of $Re_x$ as secondary. The reasoning is fully consistent with our derivation.\n-   **Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. For $T_w  T_e$, a temperature maximum is guaranteed at sufficiently large $Re_x$, independent of $Pr$ and $M_e$, because streamwise convection dominates and suppresses transverse gradients; $Re_x$ is the controlling parameter.**\n\n-   This is incorrect. The derivation shows the existence criterion is based on the Brinkman number, not the Reynolds number. A large $Re_x$ corresponds to a thin boundary layer, which enhances gradients, but does not in itself guarantee a temperature maximum. The claim of independence from $Pr$ and $M_e$ is fundamentally wrong, as these parameters quantify the dissipation effect.\n-   **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. A temperature maximum requires $T_w  T_e$ so that the profile can turn over; the governing nondimensional group is the Biot number $Bi$ of the plate, and compressibility effects are secondary.**\n\n-   This is incorrect. A temperature maximum due to an internal source (dissipation) can and does occur for a cooled wall, $T_w  T_e$. For a heated wall ($T_w  T_e$), the temperature profile would monotonically decrease towards $T_e$ in the absence of other effects. The Biot number relates to solid-body conduction and is irrelevant to the fluid boundary layer's internal structure. Compressibility effects (high $M_e$) are the primary reason for significant viscous dissipation, not a secondary effect.\n-   **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. With $T_w  T_e$, a temperature maximum is possible only at very small $Pr$ (say $Pr \\ll 1$), because strong thermal diffusion is needed to create an interior extremum; the controlling parameters are $Re_x$ and $Pr$, and viscous dissipation and $M_e$ do not enter except via minor property variations.**\n\n-   This is incorrect. The reasoning is physically flawed. A small $Pr$ implies high thermal diffusivity ($k/(\\rho c_p)$), which would act to smooth out and eliminate temperature peaks, not create them. Furthermore, the statement that viscous dissipation and $M_e$ are not important is a direct contradiction of the fundamental physics; they are the cause of the phenomenon. The controlling parameters are not $Re_x$ and $Pr$ in the manner described.\n-   **Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2472735"}, {"introduction": "Building upon the conceptual understanding of viscous heating, this exercise provides a quantitative framework for its impact on wall heat flux.

Introduce the Damköhler number (Da) for gas-phase chemistry based on the stagnation-point strain:\n$$\n\\mathrm{Da}_g \\equiv \\frac{\\tau_{\\mathrm{flow}}}{\\tau_{\\mathrm{chem}}} \\sim \\frac{1/a}{1/(k_c c^{\\,n})} = \\frac{k_c c^{\\,n}}{a}.\n$$\nFurthermore, define a vibrational nonequilibrium Damköhler number for vibrational–translational (V–T) energy exchange,\n$$\n\\mathrm{Da}_v \\equiv \\frac{\\tau_{\\mathrm{flow}}}{\\tau_{\\mathrm{vib}}} ,\n$$\nwhere $\\tau_{\\mathrm{vib}}$ is the characteristic vibrational relaxation time, and a Lewis number (Le) $\\mathrm{Le} \\equiv \\alpha/D$ with $\\alpha$ the thermal diffusivity and $D$ a representative mass diffusivity.\n\nUsing this fundamental base, select the option that correctly enumerates the core assumptions of the classical Fay-Riddell stagnation-point analysis and correctly identifies the flow regimes where chemical nonequilibrium in the boundary layer invalidates those assumptions.\n\nA.

Chemical-nonequilibrium invalidation: when gas-phase finite-rate chemistry becomes comparable to convective–diffusive transport in the boundary layer, i.e., $\\mathrm{Da}_g \\gtrsim \\mathcal{O}(1)$, and/or when strong internal-energy nonequilibrium exists so that $\\mathrm{Da}_v \\sim \\mathcal{O}(1)$ and thermochemical state departs from local thermal equilibrium; these typically occur in high-enthalpy hypersonic flows at moderate densities where post-shock temperatures are high enough to drive gas-phase recombination within the boundary layer, and in regimes with partially catalytic walls where surface chemistry no longer enforces diffusion-controlled recombination.\n\nB.

A solution will be derived.\n\n### Derivation and Analysis\n\nThe Fay-Riddell theory provides a semi-analytical solution for the stagnation-point heat flux in a high-enthalpy, dissociated flow. It achieves this by transforming the governing partial differential equations (PDEs) into a set of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) using a similarity transformation, valid in the stagnation region where $u_e \\approx a\\,x$.\n\nA central pillar of the analysis is the simplification of the energy and species transport equations. This is achieved through assumptions on the transport properties. In particular, the assumption of a unity Lewis number ($\\mathrm{Le}=1$) is critical. The Lewis number, $\\mathrm{Le} = \\alpha/D = (k/\\rho c_p)/D$, relates thermal diffusivity to mass diffusivity. When $\\mathrm{Le}=1$, the energy contribution from heat conduction, $\\partial/\\partial y (k \\,\\partial T/\\partial y)$, and the energy transport due to species diffusion, $-\\sum_k \\partial(h_k J_{k,y})/\\partial y$, can be combined into a single term involving the gradient of the mixture enthalpy, $\\partial/\\partial y ((\\rho D)\\,\\partial h/\\partial y)$. This greatly simplifies the energy equation and couples it elegantly to the species conservation equations, enabling a more straightforward solution.\n\nAnother critical component is the treatment of the chemical source terms, $\\dot{\\omega}_k$. A full solution with finite-rate chemistry requires complex numerical integration. Fay and Riddell bypassed this by examining two limiting cases for the chemical kinetics within the boundary layer:\n1.  **Equilibrium Flow**: Chemical reactions are infinitely fast compared to the fluid motion time scale ($\\tau_{\\mathrm{chem}} \\ll \\tau_{\\mathrm{flow}}$, so $\\mathrm{Da}_g \\to \\infty$). The chemical composition is determined instantly by the local thermodynamic state (pressure and temperature). The source term $\\dot{\\omega}_k$ does not need to be modeled explicitly; algebraic equilibrium relations are used instead.\n2.  **Frozen Flow**: Chemical reactions are infinitely slow within the boundary layer ($\\tau_{\\mathrm{chem}} \\gg \\tau_{\\mathrm{flow}}$, so $\\mathrm{Da}_g \\to 0$). The chemical source term is zero: $\\dot{\\omega}_k = 0$. The composition of the gas flowing through the boundary layer is \"frozen\" at its state at the boundary layer edge (post-shock). Any chemical change (recombination of atoms into molecules) can only occur at the wall surface, if it is catalytic.\n\nThe wall boundary condition is also treated in limiting cases: a **fully catalytic wall** (which forces recombination, maximizing heat release at the surface) or a **non-catalytic wall** (which is inert).\n\nFinally, the classical theory assumes **local thermal equilibrium (LTE)**, meaning all internal energy modes (translational, rotational, vibrational, electronic) are characterized by a single temperature, $T$. This assumption is valid when the time scale for internal energy relaxation is much shorter than the flow time scale, e.g., $\\tau_{\\mathrm{vib}} \\ll \\tau_{\\mathrm{flow}}$, which corresponds to $\\mathrm{Da}_v \\to \\infty$.\n\nThe assumptions of the theory are invalidated when the flow lies between these limits. Specifically, **chemical nonequilibrium** refers to the case where reaction rates are finite, i.e., $\\tau_{\\mathrm{chem}} \\sim \\tau_{\\mathrm{flow}}$ or $\\mathrm{Da}_g \\sim \\mathcal{O}(1)$. In this regime, the simplifying assumptions of frozen or equilibrium flow are no longer valid, and the full species equations with finite-rate source terms must be solved. Similarly, **thermal nonequilibrium** occurs when internal energy relaxation is slow, i.e., $\\tau_{\\mathrm{vib}} \\sim \\tau_{\\mathrm{flow}}$ or $\\mathrm{Da}_v \\sim \\mathcal{O}(1)$, requiring multi-temperature models and invalidating the single-$T$ assumption of the classical theory.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. Assumptions: steady, laminar, axisymmetric stagnation-point boundary layer, with thin-layer approximations and inviscid edge velocity $u_e \\approx a\\,x$; negligible streamwise conduction and viscous dissipation in the energy balance; multicomponent diffusion represented with constant or edge-referenced effective transport coefficients and near-unity Lewis numbers; negligible gas-phase reaction rates within the boundary layer (i.e., \"frozen\" chemistry in the gas phase), with a fully catalytic wall so that recombination occurs at the surface; wall catalysis modeled via species flux boundary conditions; negligible viscous–inviscid interaction. Chemical-nonequilibrium invalidation: when gas-phase finite-rate chemistry becomes comparable to convective–diffusive transport in the boundary layer, i.e., $\\mathrm{Da}_g \\gtrsim \\mathcal{O}(1)$, and/or when strong internal-energy nonequilibrium exists so that $\\mathrm{Da}_v \\sim \\mathcal{O}(1)$ and thermochemical state departs from local thermal equilibrium; these typically occur in high-enthalpy hypersonic flows at moderate densities where post-shock temperatures are high enough to drive gas-phase recombination within the boundary layer, and in regimes with partially catalytic walls where surface chemistry no longer enforces diffusion-controlled recombination.**\n\n- **Analysis of Assumptions**: This option correctly lists the majority of the fundamental assumptions: steady, laminar, stagnation-point boundary layer; the linear edge velocity profile $u_e \\approx a\\,x$; and the use of thin-layer approximations. It correctly identifies the critical assumption of \"near-unity Lewis numbers\", which is paramount for simplifying the energy equation. It describes one of the two key limiting cases: \"frozen\" chemistry ($\\mathrm{Da}_g \\to 0$) paired with a fully catalytic wall. The only point of contention is the claim of \"negligible... viscous dissipation\". Viscous dissipation, $\\Phi$, is a primary heating mechanism in high-speed flows and is generally *included* in the Fay-Riddell formulation. However, its exclusion might be considered a further simplification in some contexts, and this minor inaccuracy does not undermine the overall correctness of the option, especially in comparison to the others.\n- **Analysis of Invalidation Conditions**: The description of when the assumptions fail is excellent and comprehensive. It correctly identifies the finite-rate chemistry regime ($\\mathrm{Da}_g \\sim \\mathcal{O}(1)$) and the thermal nonequilibrium regime ($\\mathrm{Da}_v \\sim \\mathcal{O}(1)$) as the conditions that invalidate the simplified limiting-case analysis. It also accurately describes the physical conditions (high enthalpy, moderate density) and boundary conditions (partially catalytic wall) where these nonequilibrium effects become dominant.\n- **Verdict**: **Correct**. Despite a minor imprecision regarding viscous dissipation, this option provides the most accurate and comprehensive description of both the core assumptions and the regimes of invalidation.\n\n**B. Assumptions: turbulent stagnation-point boundary layer, calorically perfect gas with constant specific heats, isothermal normal shock with no dissociation, noncatalytic wall, and chemical equilibrium in the boundary layer everywhere; chemical-nonequilibrium invalidation: when the free-stream Mach number is $M_\\infty  3$, because subsonic post-shock conditions suppress dissociation.**\n\n- **Analysis of Assumptions**: This option is fundamentally flawed. Fay-Riddell theory is for a *laminar* boundary layer, not turbulent. It is specifically formulated for a *dissociating gas*, which is not calorically perfect. The bow shock is strong and highly non-isothermal, causing significant dissociation. These assumptions describe a completely different and incorrect physical problem.\n- **Analysis of Invalidation Conditions**: This is also incorrect. Chemical nonequilibrium effects are most prominent in high Mach number flows ($M_\\infty \\gg 5$), not at $M_\\infty  3$, where real gas effects are typically negligible.\n- **Verdict**: **Incorrect**.\n\n**C. Assumptions: steady, laminar boundary layer with thin-layer approximations and $u_e \\approx a\\,x$, negligible viscous dissipation, and instantaneous chemical equilibrium throughout the boundary layer (gas-phase reactions infinitely fast), with a perfectly noncatalytic wall; chemical-nonequilibrium invalidation: when $\\mathrm{Da}_g \\ll 1$ (frozen chemistry) so that gas-phase reactions cannot enforce equilibrium.**\n\n- **Analysis of Assumptions**: This option correctly identifies the steady, laminar assumptions and the equilibrium chemistry limit ($\\mathrm{Da}_g \\to \\infty$). However, it fails to mention the crucial assumption of a near-unity Lewis number, which is essential for the analytical simplification.\n- **Analysis of Invalidation Conditions**: The description of invalidation is trivial and incomplete. Stating that the equilibrium assumption is invalid when the flow is frozen ($\\mathrm{Da}_g \\ll 1$) is a tautology. It fails to describe the general case of finite-rate chemical nonequilibrium ($\\mathrm{Da}_g \\sim \\mathcal{O}(1)$) or the problem of thermal nonequilibrium ($\\mathrm{Da}_v \\sim \\mathcal{O}(1)$), both of which are central to the question.\n- **Verdict**: **Incorrect**. The description is far too simplistic and omits key information present in option A.\n\n**D. Assumptions: slip-flow boundary layer with rarefaction effects dominant ($\\mathrm{Kn} \\gtrsim 0.1$), explicit inclusion of finite-rate gas-phase and surface chemistry in the governing equations, and noncontinuum heat transfer; chemical-nonequilibrium invalidation: when $\\mathrm{Kn} \\to 0$ and continuum conditions recover, because diffusion models lose validity.**\n\n- **Analysis of Assumptions**: This option is entirely incorrect. Fay-Riddell is a *continuum* theory, valid for Knudsen numbers $\\mathrm{Kn} \\to 0$. It is not a slip-flow or rarefied gas dynamics model. Furthermore, it *avoids* explicit inclusion of finite-rate chemistry by considering limiting cases, which is the opposite of what is stated.\n- **Analysis of Invalidation Conditions**: The logic here is inverted. Continuum diffusion models *become valid* as $\\mathrm{Kn} \\to 0$, they do not lose validity.\n- **Verdict**: **Incorrect**. This option confuses the continuum boundary-layer regime with the rarefied gas regime.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2472745"}]}
