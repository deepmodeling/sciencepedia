The derivation must proceed from the fundamental principles and idealizations provided.\n\nFirst, we establish the temperature distribution in the liquid adjacent to the heated plate prior to boiling. The problem states a linear temperature profile across a thermal boundary layer of thickness $\\delta_{T}$. At the wall, $y=0$, the temperature is $T(0) = T_{w}$. At the edge of the boundary layer, $y=\\delta_{T}$, the temperature is the bulk liquid temperature, $T(\\delta_{T}) = T_{\\infty} = T_{\\mathrm{sat}} - \\Delta T_{\\mathrm{sub}}$. The linear temperature profile is therefore given by:\n$$T(y) = T_{w} - \\left( \\frac{T_{w} - T_{\\infty}}{\\delta_{T}} \\right) y$$\nWe define the wall superheat as $\\Delta T_{w} \\equiv T_{w} - T_{\\mathrm{sat}}$. The total temperature drop across the boundary layer is $T_{w} - T_{\\infty} = (T_{w} - T_{\\mathrm{sat}}) + (T_{\\mathrm{sat}} - T_{\\infty}) = \\Delta T_{w} + \\Delta T_{\\mathrm{sub}}$. Substituting this into the temperature profile equation yields:\n$$T(y) = T_{w} - \\left( \\frac{\\Delta T_{w} + \\Delta T_{\\mathrm{sub}}}{\\delta_{T}} \\right) y$$\nA vapor embryo can be sustained only within the portion of the boundary layer where the liquid is superheated, i.e., where $T(y) \\ge T_{\\mathrm{sat}}$. Let $y^{\\ast}$ be the distance from the wall at which the temperature is exactly $T_{\\mathrm{sat}}$.\n$$T(y^{\\ast}) = T_{\\mathrm{sat}} = T_{w} - \\left( \\frac{\\Delta T_{w} + \\Delta T_{\\mathrm{sub}}}{\\delta_{T}} \\right) y^{\\ast}$$\nRearranging to solve for $y^{\\ast}$:\n$$T_{w} - T_{\\mathrm{sat}} = \\Delta T_{w} = \\left( \\frac{\\Delta T_{w} + \\Delta T_{\\mathrm{sub}}}{\\delta_{T}} \\right) y^{\\ast}$$\n$$y^{\\ast} = \\delta_{T} \\frac{\\Delta T_{w}}{\\Delta T_{w} + \\Delta T_{\\mathrm{sub}}}$$\nThe problem posits that the largest activatable cavity has a radius $r_{\\max}$ related to $y^{\\ast}$ by a geometric factor $C_{\\mathrm{H}}$, where $0  C_{\\mathrm{H}} \\le 1$. Thus,\n$$r_{\\max} = C_{\\mathrm{H}} y^{\\ast} = C_{\\mathrm{H}} \\delta_{T} \\frac{\\Delta T_{w}}{\\Delta T_{w} + \\Delta T_{\\mathrm{sub}}}$$\nThis expression relates the maximum activatable cavity size to the thermal conditions ($\\Delta T_{w}$, $\\Delta T_{\\mathrm{sub}}$, $\\delta_{T}$).\n\nNext, we establish the condition for the smallest activatable cavity, $r_{\\min}$. This is determined by the mechanical stability of a vapor embryo. The problem states $r_{\\min} = R_{c}$, where $R_{c}$ is the critical radius of curvature. A stable embryo requires the vapor pressure inside, $p_{v}$, to be sufficiently high to balance the surrounding liquid pressure, $p_{l}$, and the surface tension force. The pressure difference is given by the Laplace equation, $\\Delta p = p_{v} - p_{l} = 2\\sigma/R_{c}$.\nThe vapor pressure inside the embryo is the saturation pressure corresponding to the temperature at the wall, $p_{v} = p_{\\mathrm{sat}}(T_{w})$. The liquid pressure is the system pressure, which corresponds to the saturation temperature of the bulk fluid, $p_{l} = p_{\\mathrm{sat}}(T_{\\mathrm{sat}})$. The pressure difference is therefore $\\Delta p = p_{\\mathrm{sat}}(T_{w}) - p_{\\mathrm{sat}}(T_{\\mathrm{sat}})$.\nUsing the provided linearized Clausius-Clapeyron relation, $dp_{\\mathrm{sat}}/dT \\approx \\rho_{v} h_{fg}/T_{\\mathrm{sat}}$, we can approximate this pressure difference for a small wall superheat $\\Delta T_{w}$:\n$$\\Delta p \\approx \\left( \\frac{dp_{\\mathrm{sat}}}{dT} \\right)_{T_{\\mathrm{sat}}} \\Delta T_{w} = \\frac{\\rho_{v} h_{fg}}{T_{\\mathrm{sat}}} \\Delta T_{w}$$\nEquating the two expressions for $\\Delta p$:\n$$\\frac{2\\sigma}{R_{c}} = \\frac{\\rho_{v} h_{fg}}{T_{\\mathrm{sat}}} \\Delta T_{w}$$\nSolving for the critical radius $R_{c}$:\n$$R_{c} = \\frac{2\\sigma T_{\\mathrm{sat}}}{\\rho_{v} h_{fg} \\Delta T_{w}}$$\nSince $r_{\\min} = R_{c}$, we have:\n$$r_{\\min} = \\frac{2\\sigma T_{\\mathrm{sat}}}{\\rho_{v} h_{fg} \\Delta T_{w}}$$\n\nThe onset of nucleate boiling (ONB) is defined as the condition where at least one cavity can be activated, which occurs at the threshold where the smallest activatable cavity is equal in size to the largest, i.e., $r_{\\min} = r_{\\max}$. At this onset condition, the wall superheat $\\Delta T_{w}$ becomes the superheat at ONB, $\\Delta T_{\\mathrm{ONB}}$.\nSetting the expressions for $r_{\\min}$ and $r_{\\max}$ equal:\n$$\\frac{2\\sigma T_{\\mathrm{sat}}}{\\rho_{v} h_{fg} \\Delta T_{\\mathrm{ONB}}} = C_{\\mathrm{H}} \\delta_{T} \\frac{\\Delta T_{\\mathrm{ONB}}}{\\Delta T_{\\mathrm{ONB}} + \\Delta T_{\\mathrm{sub}}}$$\nThis equation must be solved for $\\Delta T_{\\mathrm{ONB}}$. Rearranging the terms, we obtain a quadratic equation for $\\Delta T_{\\mathrm{ONB}}$:\n$$(C_{\\mathrm{H}} \\delta_{T} \\rho_{v} h_{fg}) (\\Delta T_{\\mathrm{ONB}})^2 - (2\\sigma T_{\\mathrm{sat}}) \\Delta T_{\\mathrm{ONB}} - (2\\sigma T_{\\mathrm{sat}}) \\Delta T_{\\mathrm{sub}} = 0$$\nThis is a quadratic equation of the form $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$, with $x = \\Delta T_{\\mathrm{ONB}}$, and coefficients:\n$a = C_{\\mathrm{H}} \\delta_{T} \\rho_{v} h_{fg}$\n$b = -2\\sigma T_{\\mathrm{sat}}$\n$c = -2\\sigma T_{\\mathrm{sat}} \\Delta T_{\\mathrm{sub}}$\n\nThe solution is given by the quadratic formula, $x = (-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac})/(2a)$. Since wall superheat $\\Delta T_{\\mathrm{ONB}}$ must be a positive quantity for boiling to occur, and given that $a0$, $b0$, and $c \\le 0$, the term under the square root $\\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}$ is real and greater than or equal to $|b|$. Thus, we must choose the positive sign to ensure a physically meaningful positive solution for $\\Delta T_{\\mathrm{ONB}}$.\n$$\\Delta T_{\\mathrm{ONB}} = \\frac{-b + \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$$\nSubstituting the coefficients:\n$$\\Delta T_{\\mathrm{ONB}} = \\frac{2\\sigma T_{\\mathrm{sat}} + \\sqrt{(-2\\sigma T_{\\mathrm{sat}})^2 - 4(C_{\\mathrm{H}} \\delta_{T} \\rho_{v} h_{fg})(-2\\sigma T_{\\mathrm{sat}} \\Delta T_{\\mathrm{sub}})}}{2 C_{\\mathrm{H}} \\delta_{T} \\rho_{v} h_{fg}}$$\nSimplifying the expression under the square root:\n$$\\Delta T_{\\mathrm{ONB}} = \\frac{2\\sigma T_{\\mathrm{sat}} + \\sqrt{4(\\sigma T_{\\mathrm{sat}})^2 + 8 C_{\\mathrm{H}} \\delta_{T} \\rho_{v} h_{fg} \\sigma T_{\\mathrm{sat}} \\Delta T_{\\mathrm{sub}}}}{2 C_{\\mathrm{H}} \\delta_{T} \\rho_{v} h_{fg}}$$\nFactoring out $4(\\sigma T_{\\mathrm{sat}})^2$ from the square root:\n$$\\Delta T_{\\mathrm{ONB}} = \\frac{2\\sigma T_{\\mathrm{sat}} + 2\\sigma T_{\\mathrm{sat}}\\sqrt{1 + \\frac{2 C_{\\mathrm{H}} \\delta_{T} \\rho_{v} h_{fg} \\Delta T_{\\mathrm{sub}}}{\\sigma T_{\\mathrm{sat}}}}}{2 C_{\\mathrm{H}} \\delta_{T} \\rho_{v} h_{fg}}$$\n$$\\Delta T_{\\mathrm{ONB}} = \\frac{\\sigma T_{\\mathrm{sat}}}{C_{\\mathrm{H}} \\delta_{T} \\rho_{v} h_{fg}} \\left( 1 + \\sqrt{1 + \\frac{2 C_{\\mathrm{H}} \\delta_{T} \\rho_{v} h_{fg} \\Delta T_{\\mathrm{sub}}}{\\sigma T_{\\mathrm{sat}}}} \\right)$$\nThis is the required explicit closed-form expression for $\\Delta T_{\\mathrm{ONB}}$.\n\nFinally, we analyze the effect of subcooling $\\Delta T_{\\mathrm{sub}}$ on $\\Delta T_{\\mathrm{ONB}}$. All parameters in the expression ($\\sigma$, $T_{\\mathrm{sat}}$, $C_{\\mathrm{H}}$, $\\delta_{T}$, $\\rho_{v}$, $h_{fg}$) are positive constants. The term inside the square root is of the form $1 + K \\Delta T_{\\mathrm{sub}}$, where $K = 2 C_{\\mathrm{H}} \\delta_{T} \\rho_{v} h_{fg} / (\\sigma T_{\\mathrm{sat}})$ is a positive constant. As the subcooling $\\Delta T_{\\mathrm{sub}}  0$ increases, the argument of the square root increases. Since the square root function is monotonically increasing for positive arguments, the entire expression for $\\Delta T_{\\mathrm{ONB}}$ increases. Therefore, a higher degree of subcooling requires a higher wall superheat to initiate boiling. This is physically consistent: a colder bulk liquid suppresses boiling by shrinking the thickness of the superheated liquid layer near the wall, requiring a higher wall temperature to satisfy the nucleation criteria. For large subcooling ($\\Delta T_{\\mathrm{sub}} \\to \\infty$), the expression shows that $\\Delta T_{\\mathrm{ONB}}$ grows asymptotically as $\\sqrt{\\Delta T_{\\mathrm{sub}}}$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{\\sigma T_{\\mathrm{sat}}}{C_{\\mathrm{H}} \\delta_{T} \\rho_{v} h_{fg}} \\left( 1 + \\sqrt{1 + \\frac{2 C_{\\mathrm{H}} \\delta_{T} \\rho_{v} h_{fg} \\Delta T_{\\mathrm{sub}}}{\\sigma T_{\\mathrm{sat}}}} \\right)}$$", "id": "2475176"}, {"introduction": "While the onset of boiling is a crucial starting point, the ultimate operational limit is often the Critical Heat Flux (CHF), beyond which heat transfer efficiency plummets and surface temperatures can rise dramatically.

This approach, pioneered by N. Zuber, models the CHF condition as a limit of stability for the countercurrent flow of vapor leaving the heated surface and liquid returning to it. On a large horizontal plate, vapor escapes in columns or jets. The CHF is reached when the velocity of these vapor jets becomes so high that it prevents the liquid from rewetting the surface, leading to the formation of a stable vapor film. This is a manifestation of Kelvin-Helmholtz instability at the interface of the vapor jets and the surrounding liquid.\n\nThe instability is most pronounced at a characteristic wavelength, which is related to the Taylor wavelength, $\\lambda_{T}$, for an unstable interface between a dense fluid atop a lighter fluid, stabilized by surface tension $\\sigma$. The critical Taylor wavelength is given by $\\lambda_{c} = 2\\pi \\sqrt{\\frac{\\sigma}{g(\\rho_{\\ell}-\\rho_{v})}}$. Zuber's model assumes that the vapor jets are arranged in a square grid with a spacing corresponding to this critical wavelength, $\\lambda_{c}$. The diameter of a vapor jet is taken as $D_{jet} = \\frac{\\lambda_{c}}{2}$. The area of the heater occupied by vapor, $A_{v}$, relative to the total heater area, $A_{h}$, is then $A_{v}/A_{h} = \\frac{\\pi (D_{jet}/2)^2}{\\lambda_{c}^2} = \\frac{\\pi (\\lambda_{c}/4)^2}{\\lambda_{c}^2} = \\frac{\\pi}{16}$, but this is one of several geometric assumptions possible. The accepted model instead relates the superficial vapor velocity, $j_{v}$, to the instability.\n\nThe total heat flux is the product of the latent heat of vaporization, $h_{fg}$, and the mass flux of vapor, $\\rho_{v} j_{v}$, so $q'' = \\rho_{v} h_{fg} j_{v}$. The critical condition, $q''_{\\mathrm{CHF}}$, corresponds to the maximum possible vapor superficial velocity, $j_{v, \\mathrm{max}}$. Hydrodynamic stability theory yields an expression for this maximum velocity:\n$$j_{v, \\mathrm{max}} = K \\left[ \\frac{\\sigma g (\\rho_{\\ell} - \\rho_v)}{\\rho_v^2} \\right]^{1/4}$$\nwhere $K$ is a constant. For an infinite horizontal plate, theoretical analysis gives $K = \\frac{\\pi}{24}$. Combining these gives the Zuber correlation for CHF:\n$$q''_{\\mathrm{CHF}} = \\rho_{v} h_{fg} \\left( \\frac{\\pi}{24} \\right) \\left[ \\frac{\\sigma g (\\rho_{\\ell} - \\rho_v)}{\\rho_v^2} \\right]^{1/4}$$\nThis expression can be rearranged into the final form for the derivation:\n$$q''_{\\mathrm{CHF}} = \\frac{\\pi}{24} h_{fg} \\left[ \\sigma g (\\rho_{\\ell} - \\rho_v) \\rho_v^2 \\right]^{1/4}$$\nThis formula represents the derived expression for CHF in terms of the specified physical properties.\n\nNext, we evaluate this expression numerically using the provided data:\nGravitational acceleration, $g = 9.81\\,\\mathrm{m}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-2}$.\nSurface tension, $\\sigma = 0.0589\\,\\mathrm{N}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-1}$.\nLiquid density, $\\rho_{\\ell} = 958\\,\\mathrm{kg}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-3}$.\nVapor density, $\\rho_{v} = 0.597\\,\\mathrm{kg}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-3}$.\nLatent heat of vaporization, $h_{fg} = 2.257 \\times 10^{6}\\,\\mathrm{J}\\,\\mathrm{kg}^{-1}$.\nThe density difference is $\\rho_{\\ell} - \\rho_{v} = 958 - 0.597 = 957.403\\,\\mathrm{kg}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-3}$.\n\nFirst, we compute the term within the fourth root:\n$$X = \\sigma g (\\rho_{\\ell} - \\rho_v) \\rho_v^2 = (0.0589) \\cdot (9.81) \\cdot (957.403) \\cdot (0.597)^2 \\approx 197.16 \\, \\mathrm{kg}^2\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-6}$$\n$$X^{1/4} \\approx (197.16)^{1/4} \\approx 3.748 \\, \\mathrm{kg}^{1/2}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-3/2}$$\nNow, we calculate the CHF:\n$$q''_{\\mathrm{CHF}} = \\frac{\\pi}{24} h_{fg} X^{1/4} \\approx \\frac{\\pi}{24} \\cdot (2.257 \\times 10^{6}) \\cdot (3.748) \\approx 1.1083 \\times 10^{6} \\, \\mathrm{W}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-2}$$\nSo, $q''_{\\mathrm{CHF}} \\approx 1.11\\,\\mathrm{MW}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-2}$.\n\nThe next step is to calculate the operating heat flux, $q''_{\\mathrm{op}}$, using the given nucleate-boiling correlation, $q'' = C_{\\mathrm{nb}}\\,\\Delta T^{n}$, for the specified wall superheat $\\Delta T = 25\\,\\mathrm{K}$. The parameters are $C_{\\mathrm{nb}} = 180\\,\\mathrm{W}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-2}\\,\\mathrm{K}^{-n}$ and $n = 2.6$.\n$$q''_{\\mathrm{op}} = (180) \\cdot (25)^{2.6} \\approx (180) \\cdot (4311.63) \\approx 776093 \\, \\mathrm{W}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-2}$$\nSo, $q''_{\\mathrm{op}} \\approx 0.776\\,\\mathrm{MW}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-2}$.\n\nThe safety margin factor, $M$, is defined as the ratio of the critical heat flux to the operating heat flux, $M = q''_{\\mathrm{CHF}}/q''_{\\mathrm{op}}$.\n$$M = \\frac{1.1083 \\times 10^{6}}{776093} \\approx 1.42807$$\nRounding to three significant figures, the safety margin is $M \\approx 1.43$.\n\nFinally, we discuss the influence of uncertainties on the computed safety margin $M$. The expression for $M$ is:\n$$M = \\frac{q''_{\\mathrm{CHF}}}{q''_{\\mathrm{op}}} = \\frac{ \\frac{\\pi}{24} h_{fg} \\left[ \\sigma g (\\rho_{\\ell} - \\rho_v) \\rho_v^2 \\right]^{1/4} }{ C_{\\mathrm{nb}}\\,\\Delta T^{n} }$$\nUncertainties in the thermophysical properties ($h_{fg}, \\sigma, \\rho_{\\ell}, \\rho_{v}$) of water at $1\\,\\mathrm{atm}$ are generally very small, as these are well-characterized. The sensitivity of $M$ to these properties varies. It is linear with $h_{fg}$, proportional to $\\rho_{v}^{1/2}$, and proportional to $\\sigma^{1/4}$ and $(\\rho_{\\ell} - \\rho_{v})^{1/4}$. The dependency is weakest for the quantities under the fourth root. Even the constant $K = \\pi/24$ is a theoretical value; empirical data often suggest a slightly different value (e.g., $K \\approx 0.149$), which introduces a model uncertainty of about $10-15\\%$.\n\nThe most significant source of uncertainty stems from the denominator, which describes the operating nucleate boiling condition. The parameters $C_{\\mathrm{nb}}$ and $n$ are empirical and are extremely sensitive to the surface condition, including its micro-geometry (roughness), chemistry, cleanliness, and aging. The term \"electro-polished\" is a specification, but it does not guarantee perfect reproducibility. Small variations in surface preparation can lead to large variations in $C_{\\mathrm{nb}}$ and, to a lesser extent, $n$. Consequently, the operating heat flux $q''_{\\mathrm{op}}$ calculated from this correlation carries significant uncertainty.\n\nFurthermore, $q''_{\\mathrm{op}}$ depends on $\\Delta T$ raised to the power of $n = 2.6$. This high exponent amplifies any error in the measurement or control of the wall superheat $\\Delta T$. A small deviation from the design value of $\\Delta T = 25\\,\\mathrm{K}$ will result in a much larger fractional change in $q''_{\\mathrm{op}}$ and, therefore, in the safety margin $M$. For example, a mere $5\\%$ error in $\\Delta T$ (i.e., $\\pm 1.25\\,\\mathrm{K}$) would cause a change of approximately $1.05^{2.6} - 1 \\approx 13.5\\%$ in $q''_{\\mathrm{op}}$.\n\nIn conclusion, the safety margin $M$ is most sensitive to the parameters of the nucleate boiling correlation ($C_{\\mathrm{nb}}$, $n$) and the operating wall superheat ($\\Delta T$), as these are empirical, surface-dependent, and involve a strong power-law relationship.

Each inner list must be ordered as $[C_{sf}, n, u_{C_{sf}}, u_n]$. For example, the output format must be exactly like:\n\"[ [cA,nA,uCA,unA],[cB,nB,uCB,unB],[cC,nC,uCC,unC] ]\"\nexcept with the actual numeric values rounded to six significant figures and no additional text.", "solution": "The solution is presented in four parts as requested by the problem statement.\n\n**Part 1: Model Justification and Dimensionality**\n\nThe problem starts with the assumption of scale invariance for the heat flux $q^{\\prime\\prime}$ as a function of wall superheat $\\Delta T = T_w - T_{sat}$. This physical postulate is expressed as:\n$$ q^{\\prime\\prime}(\\lambda\\,\\Delta T) \\propto \\lambda^{n}\\,q^{\\prime\\prime}(\\Delta T) $$\nwhere $\\lambda$ is an arbitrary positive scaling factor and $n$ is a constant exponent. The problem states that the functional dependence is monotone and *strongly* scale-invariant, which implies that the proportionality can be treated as an equality. This defines $q^{\\prime\\prime}(\\Delta T)$ as a homogeneous function of degree $n$:\n$$ q^{\\prime\\prime}(\\lambda\\,\\Delta T) = \\lambda^{n}\\,q^{\\prime\\prime}(\\Delta T) $$\nLet's set $\\Delta T = 1$ (assuming dimensionless units for a moment). Then $q^{\\prime\\prime}(\\lambda) = \\lambda^n q^{\\prime\\prime}(1)$. If we replace $\\lambda$ with the variable $\\Delta T$, we get $q^{\\prime\\prime}(\\Delta T) = (\\Delta T)^n q^{\\prime\\prime}(1)$. The term $q^{\\prime\\prime}(1)$ is a constant for a given fluid-surface combination and pressure. Let's call this constant $C_{sf}$. Thus, the functional form must be a power law:\n$$ q^{\\prime\\prime}(\\Delta T) = C_{sf} (\\Delta T)^n $$\nThis is a common form for empirical correlations in heat transfer, most famously used in the Rohsenow correlation for nucleate boiling. The condition that $q^{\\prime\\prime}  0$ for $\\Delta T  0$ requires that $C_{sf}  0$, as $\\Delta T^n  0$ for $\\Delta T  0$.\n\nNext, we establish the dimensionality of the coefficient $C_{sf}$ from the principle of dimensional homogeneity. The units of each term in the equation must be consistent. The exponent $n$ must be a dimensionless number for the operation $(\\Delta T)^n$ to be physically meaningful when $\\Delta T$ has dimensions.\nThe units are denoted by square brackets $[\\cdot]$.\n-   Heat flux, $q^{\\prime\\prime}$: $[q^{\\prime\\prime}] = \\mathrm{W\\,m^{-2}}$\n-   Wall superheat, $\\Delta T$: $[\\Delta T] = \\mathrm{K}$\n-   Exponent, $n$: $[n] = 1$ (dimensionless)\n\nFrom the model equation, we have:\n$$ [q^{\\prime\\prime}] = [C_{sf}] \\cdot [\\Delta T]^n $$\nSubstituting the known units:\n$$ \\mathrm{W\\,m^{-2}} = [C_{sf}] \\cdot \\mathrm{K}^n $$\nSolving for the units of $C_{sf}$:\n$$ [C_{sf}] = \\frac{\\mathrm{W\\,m^{-2}}}{\\mathrm{K}^n} = \\mathrm{W\\,m^{-2}\\,K^{-n}} $$\nThis confirms the dimensionality stated in the problem.\n\n**Part 2: Statistical Model and Estimation Procedure**\n\nThe power-law model $q^{\\prime\\prime} = C_{sf}(\\Delta T)^n$ is nonlinear in its parameters $C_{sf}$ and $n$. To use linear regression techniques, we must linearize the model. The problem specifies a multiplicative error structure, which suggests a logarithmic transformation. Taking the natural logarithm of both sides of the model equation yields:\n$$ \\ln(q^{\\prime\\prime}) = \\ln(C_{sf} (\\Delta T)^n) = \\ln(C_{sf}) + n \\ln(\\Delta T) $$\nThis equation is linear in the transformed parameters. Let us define the following variables:\n-   Transformed response variable: $y_i = \\ln(q^{\\prime\\prime}_i)$\n-   Transformed predictor variable: $x_i = \\ln(\\Delta T_i)$\n-   Intercept: $\\beta_0 = \\ln(C_{sf})$\n-   Slope: $\\beta_1 = n$\n\nThe model for each data point $i$ becomes:\n$$ y_i = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x_i + \\epsilon_i $$\nwhere $\\epsilon_i$ represents the measurement error in the transformed space. The problem states this error is additive and Gaussian, $\\epsilon_i \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0, \\sigma_{y,i}^2)$.\n\nTo estimate the parameters $\\beta_0$ and $\\beta_1$, we use the method of least squares, which minimizes the sum of squared residuals. The specific procedure depends on the information available about the variances $\\sigma_{y,i}^2$.\n\n-   **Ordinary Least Squares (OLS)**: This method is used when the standard deviations $\\sigma_{y,i}$ are unknown or are assumed to be constant for all data points (homoscedasticity, $\\sigma_{y,i} = \\sigma_y$). We minimize the sum of squared residuals, $S$:\n    $$ S(\\beta_0, \\beta_1) = \\sum_{i=1}^N (y_i - (\\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x_i))^2 $$\n    This is the appropriate procedure for Dataset A.\n\n-   **Weighted Least Squares (WLS)**: This method is used when the standard deviations $\\sigma_{y,i}$ are known and vary between data points (heteroscedasticity). Each residual is weighted by the inverse of its variance, $w_i = 1/\\sigma_{y,i}^2$. We minimize the chi-squared statistic, $\\chi^2$:\n    $$ \\chi^2(\\beta_0, \\beta_1) = \\sum_{i=1}^N w_i(y_i - (\\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x_i))^2 = \\sum_{i=1}^N \\left( \\frac{y_i - (\\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x_i)}{\\sigma_{y,i}} \\right)^2 $$\n    This procedure gives more weight to more precise measurements and is appropriate for Datasets B and C.\n\n**Part 3: Derivation of Estimators and Uncertainties**\n\nWe formulate the linear model in matrix notation as $\\mathbf{y} = \\mathbf{X}\\boldsymbol{\\beta} + \\boldsymbol{\\epsilon}$, where:\n$$ \\mathbf{y} = \\begin{pmatrix} y_1 \\\\ y_2 \\\\ \\vdots \\\\ y_N \\end{pmatrix}, \\quad \\mathbf{X} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1  x_1 \\\\ 1  x_2 \\\\ \\vdots  \\vdots \\\\ 1  x_N \\end{pmatrix}, \\quad \\boldsymbol{\\beta} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\beta_0 \\\\ \\beta_1 \\end{pmatrix}, \\quad \\boldsymbol{\\epsilon} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\epsilon_1 \\\\ \\epsilon_2 \\\\ \\vdots \\\\ \\epsilon_N \\end{pmatrix} $$\nThe WLS objective function is $(\\mathbf{y} - \\mathbf{X}\\boldsymbol{\\beta})^T \\mathbf{W} (\\mathbf{y} - \\mathbf{X}\\boldsymbol{\\beta})$, where $\\mathbf{W}$ is a diagonal matrix of weights $w_i = 1/\\sigma_{y,i}^2$. The solution that minimizes this is found by setting the gradient with respect to $\\boldsymbol{\\beta}$ to zero, yielding the normal equations:\n$$ (\\mathbf{X}^T \\mathbf{W} \\mathbf{X}) \\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\beta}} = \\mathbf{X}^T \\mathbf{W} \\mathbf{y} $$\nThe WLS estimate for the parameter vector $\\boldsymbol{\\beta}$ is:\n$$ \\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\beta}} = (\\mathbf{X}^T \\mathbf{W} \\mathbf{X})^{-1} \\mathbf{X}^T \\mathbf{W} \\mathbf{y} $$\nFor OLS, the weight matrix $\\mathbf{W}$ is the identity matrix $\\mathbf{I}$.\n\nThe covariance matrix of the estimator $\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\beta}}$ is essential for determining the uncertainties of the parameters.\n-   **For WLS (known variances)**: The problem states to treat the given $\\sigma_{y,i}$ as known. In this case, the covariance matrix of $\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\beta}}$ is given exactly by:\n    $$ \\mathrm{Cov}(\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\beta}}) = (\\mathbf{X}^T \\mathbf{W} \\mathbf{X})^{-1} $$\n-   **For OLS (unknown common variance)**: The common variance $\\sigma_y^2$ is unknown and must be estimated from the data. The unbiased estimator for $\\sigma_y^2$ is $s_y^2 = \\frac{1}{N-p} \\sum_{i=1}^N (y_i - \\hat{y}_i)^2$, where $\\hat{y}_i = \\hat{\\beta}_0 + \\hat{\\beta}_1 x_i$ are the fitted values and $p=2$ is the number of parameters. The estimated covariance matrix is:\n    $$ \\widehat{\\mathrm{Cov}}(\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\beta}}) = s_y^2 (\\mathbf{X}^T \\mathbf{X})^{-1} $$\n\nThe diagonal elements of the covariance matrix are the variances of the parameter estimates:\n$$ \\mathrm{Cov}(\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\beta}}) = \\begin{pmatrix} u_{\\hat{\\beta}_0}^2  \\mathrm{cov}(\\hat{\\beta}_0, \\hat{\\beta}_1) \\\\ \\mathrm{cov}(\\hat{\\beta}_0, \\hat{\\beta}_1)  u_{\\hat{\\beta}_1}^2 \\end{pmatrix} $$\nThe standard uncertainties are $u_{\\hat{\\beta}_0}$ and $u_{\\hat{\\beta}_1}$.\n\nFinally, we propagate these uncertainties back to the original model parameters, $n$ and $C_{sf}$.\n-   For the exponent $n$: The relationship is direct, $\\hat{n} = \\hat{\\beta}_1$. Therefore, the uncertainty is also directly transferred: $u_n = u_{\\hat{\\beta}_1}$.\n-   For the coefficient $C_{sf}$: The relationship is $\\hat{C}_{sf} = \\exp(\\hat{\\beta}_0)$. We use first-order uncertainty propagation:\n    $$ u_{C_{sf}}^2 \\approx \\left(\\frac{\\partial C_{sf}}{\\partial \\beta_0}\\bigg|_{\\hat{\\beta}_0}\\right)^2 u_{\\hat{\\beta}_0}^2 $$\n    The derivative is $\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\beta_0} \\exp(\\beta_0) = \\exp(\\beta_0) = C_{sf}$.\n    $$ u_{C_{sf}}^2 \\approx (\\hat{C}_{sf})^2 u_{\\hat{\\beta}_0}^2 \\implies u_{C_{sf}} \\approx \\hat{C}_{sf} u_{\\hat{\\beta}_0} $$\nThis means the relative uncertainty in $C_{sf}$ is equal to the absolute uncertainty in its logarithm, $\\beta_0$.\n\n**Part 4: Implementation**\n\nThe derived formulas are implemented in a Python script. For each dataset:\n$1$. The input data $(\\Delta T_i, q^{\\prime\\prime}_i)$ are log-transformed to $x_i = \\ln(\\Delta T_i)$ and $y_i = \\ln(q^{\\prime\\prime}_i)$.\n$2$. For Dataset A (OLS), the weight matrix $\\mathbf{W}$ is taken as the identity matrix. The linear system is solved for $\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\beta}}$. The sample variance $s_y^2$ of the residuals is calculated, and the covariance matrix is computed as $s_y^2(\\mathbf{X}^T\\mathbf{X})^{-1}$.\n$3$. For Datasets B and C (WLS), the weight matrix $\\mathbf{W}$ is constructed with elements $w_i = 1/\\sigma_{y,i}^2$ from the provided standard deviations. The linear system is solved for $\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\beta}}$, and the covariance matrix is computed as $(\\mathbf{X}^T\\mathbf{W}\\mathbf{X})^{-1}$.\n$4$. From the diagonal elements of the covariance matrix, the uncertainties $u_{\\hat{\\beta}_0}$ and $u_{\\hat{\\beta}_1}$ are obtained.\n$5$. The parameters and their uncertainties are transformed back to the original physical space: $\\hat{n} = \\hat{\\beta}_1$, $u_n = u_{\\hat{\\beta}_1}$, $\\hat{C}_{sf} = \\exp(\\hat{\\beta}_0)$, and $u_{C_{sf}} = \\hat{C}_{sf} u_{\\hat{\\beta}_0}$.\n$6$.
