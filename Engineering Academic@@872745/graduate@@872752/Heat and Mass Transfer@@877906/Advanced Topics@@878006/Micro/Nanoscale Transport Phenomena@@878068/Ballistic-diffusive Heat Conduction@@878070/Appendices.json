The derivation must start from fundamental principles of phonon transport and justify the averaging procedure.\n\nFirst, we establish the definition of a weighted average for a frequency-dependent phonon property, $X(\\omega)$. In solid-state physics, macroscopic thermal properties are obtained by integrating the contributions of all phonon modes. The contribution of each mode to thermal energy transport is proportional to its specific heat. Therefore, a physically meaningful average of a property $X(\\omega)$ over all modes is one weighted by the modal contribution to the specific heat. The spectral volumetric heat capacity for a phonon branch $b$ is $C_{V,b}(\\omega) = g_{b}(\\omega)C_{\\text{mode}}(\\omega, T)$, where $g_{b}(\\omega)$ is the density of states per unit volume and $C_{\\text{mode}}(\\omega, T)$ is the heat capacity of a single phonon mode of frequency $\\omega$ at temperature $T$.\n\nThe modal-heat-capacity-weighted average of the mean free path $\\Lambda(\\omega)$ is thus defined as:\n$$\n\\langle \\Lambda \\rangle = \\frac{\\sum_{b} \\int_{0}^{\\omega_{D}} \\Lambda_{b}(\\omega) \\, C_{V,b}(\\omega) \\, d\\omega}{\\sum_{b} \\int_{0}^{\\omega_{D}} C_{V,b}(\\omega) \\, d\\omega}\n$$\nHere, the summation is over all phonon branches $b \\in \\{L, T\\}$. The denominator is simply the total volumetric specific heat of the solid, $C_{V}$. The numerator is related to the thermal conductivity, $k$. The kinetic theory expression for thermal conductivity, derived from the phonon Boltzmann transport equation (BTE) in the relaxation time approximation for an isotropic medium, is:\n$$\nk = \\frac{1}{3} \\sum_{b} \\int_{0}^{\\omega_{D}} v_{b} \\Lambda_{b}(\\omega) \\, C_{V,b}(\\omega) \\, d\\omega\n$$\nwhere $v_b$ is the group velocity for branch $b$. The problem defines a model where velocity is independent of frequency, which is a key feature of the Debye model. Comparing these expressions, the weighted average $\\langle \\Lambda \\rangle$ appears as a natural quantity in the theory of thermal transport.\n\nThe heat capacity of a single quantum harmonic oscillator (a phonon mode) of frequency $\\omega$ is given by:\n$$\nC_{\\text{mode}}(\\omega, T) = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial T} \\left( \\frac{\\hbar\\omega}{\\exp(\\frac{\\hbar\\omega}{k_{B}T}) - 1} \\right) = k_{B} \\left(\\frac{\\hbar\\omega}{k_{B}T}\\right)^{2} \\frac{\\exp(\\frac{\\hbar\\omega}{k_{B}T})}{\\left(\\exp(\\frac{\\hbar\\omega}{k_{B}T}) - 1\\right)^{2}}\n$$\nwhere $k_{B}$ is the Boltzmann constant and $\\hbar$ is the reduced Planck constant.\n\nThe problem states that the system is in the classical (equipartition) regime, where $T \\gg \\Theta_{D}$. The Debye temperature $\\Theta_{D}$ is related to the maximum phonon frequency $\\omega_D$ by $\\Theta_{D} = \\hbar\\omega_{D}/k_{B}$. The condition $T \\gg \\Theta_{D}$ means that $k_{B}T \\gg \\hbar\\omega_{D}$, which in turn implies $k_{B}T \\gg \\hbar\\omega$ for all phonon frequencies $\\omega \\le \\omega_{D}$. In this high-temperature limit, the argument of the exponential, $x = \\hbar\\omega/(k_{B}T)$, is small ($x \\ll 1$). We can then approximate $\\exp(x) \\approx 1+x$. The expression for the average energy of a mode simplifies to $k_B T$, and the modal heat capacity becomes:\n$$\nC_{\\text{mode}} \\approx \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial T} (k_{B}T) = k_{B}\n$$\nThis is a critical simplification: in the classical limit, the heat capacity of every phonon mode is the same constant value, $k_{B}$, regardless of its frequency.\n\nSubstituting $C_{V,b}(\\omega) = g_{b}(\\omega) k_{B}$ into the definition of $\\langle \\Lambda \\rangle$:\n$$\n\\langle \\Lambda \\rangle = \\frac{\\sum_{b} \\int_{0}^{\\omega_{D}} \\Lambda_{b}(\\omega) \\, g_{b}(\\omega) k_{B} \\, d\\omega}{\\sum_{b} \\int_{0}^{\\omega_{D}} g_{b}(\\omega) k_{B} \\, d\\omega}\n$$\nThe constant $k_{B}$ cancels from the numerator and denominator.

Even if the set $\\{L_{i}\\}$ does not span the full support of the MFP spectrum, the measurements $\\{k_{\\mathrm{eff}}(L_{i})\\}$ constrain $k_{\\mathrm{cum}}(\\Lambda)$ over the window of $\\Lambda$ where the corresponding sensitivity kernels have appreciable support, allowing partial reconstruction and rigorous bounds elsewhere by enforcing $k_{\\mathrm{cum}}(0)=0$, $k_{\\mathrm{cum}}(\\infty)=k_{\\mathrm{bulk}}$, and $\\mathrm{d}k_{\\mathrm{cum}}/\\mathrm{d}\\Lambda\\ge 0$. Inversion is an ill-posed problem of the first kind and typically requires regularization that encodes these physical constraints and any smoothness expected from the underlying phonon dispersion and scattering.", "solution": "We begin from conservation of energy and the linearized phonon Boltzmann Transport Equation (BTE) under the relaxation-time approximation. In steady or quasi-steady linear response, the modal heat flux contribution from a phonon state labeled by wavevector and branch $(\\mathbf{q},b)$ can be written, after linearization, in a form proportional to the product of the mode’s heat capacity $C_{\\mathbf{q}b}$, squared group-velocity component along the transport direction $v_{x,\\mathbf{q}b}^{2}$, and its relaxation time $\\tau_{\\mathbf{q}b}$, modulated by nonlocal effects when the imposed thermal field varies on a length scale comparable to the phonon mean free path (MFP). The mode-resolved projected MFP is $\\Lambda_{\\mathbf{q}b}=|v_{x,\\mathbf{q}b}|\\tau_{\\mathbf{q}b}$.\n\nIn the bulk diffusive limit, the thermal conductivity $k_{\\mathrm{bulk}}$ can be expressed as an integral (or sum over modes) of mode contributions. It is therefore natural to define the MFP-differential contribution $\\mathrm{d}k/\\mathrm{d}\\Lambda$ so that\n$$\nk_{\\mathrm{bulk}}=\\int_{0}^{\\infty}\\frac{\\mathrm{d}k}{\\mathrm{d}\\Lambda}\\,\\mathrm{d}\\Lambda,\n$$\nand to define the cumulative thermal conductivity function as\n$$\nk_{\\mathrm{cum}}(\\Lambda)=\\int_{0}^{\\Lambda}\\frac{\\mathrm{d}k}{\\mathrm{d}\\Lambda'}\\,\\mathrm{d}\\Lambda'.\n$$\nBy construction, $k_{\\mathrm{cum}}(0)=0$, $k_{\\mathrm{cum}}(\\infty)=k_{\\mathrm{bulk}}$, and $k_{\\mathrm{cum}}(\\Lambda)$ is nondecreasing.\n\nWhen the imposed thermal field has a characteristic length $L$ (for example, a grating period, a pump radius, or a film thickness), phonons with $\\Lambda\\gg L$ cannot fully participate in diffusive energy transport over that length, and their contribution to the effective heat conduction is suppressed relative to the bulk. Under the linearized BTE, this enters through a geometry- and boundary-condition-dependent suppression function (also called a sensitivity kernel) $S(\\Lambda/L)$ that weights the contribution of each MFP to the measured effective conductivity. The effective conductivity measured in experiment $i$ with thermal length $L_{i}$ thus has the form of a Fredholm integral equation of the first kind:\n$$\nk_{\\mathrm{eff}}(L_{i})=\\int_{0}^{\\infty}S_{i}\\!\\left(\\frac{\\Lambda}{L_{i}}\\right)\\,\\frac{\\mathrm{d}k}{\\mathrm{d}\\Lambda}\\,\\mathrm{d}\\Lambda,\n$$\nwhere $S_{i}$ is determined by the experimental geometry, transducer and substrate properties (if any), and boundary conditions. Examples include cross-plane thin-film transport, one-dimensional transient thermal grating, and axisymmetric heating by a Gaussian spot, each yielding a distinct $S_{i}$.\n\nA set of measurements $\\{k_{\\mathrm{eff}}(L_{i})\\}_{i=1}^{N}$ over a range of $\\{L_{i}\\}$ then provides linear integral constraints on $\\mathrm{d}k/\\mathrm{d}\\Lambda$. Discretizing the MFP domain into bins with unknown nonnegative weights $\\{f_{j}\\}\\approx \\{\\mathrm{d}k/\\mathrm{d}\\Lambda\\}$ and computing the corresponding discretized kernels $\\{A_{ij}\\}$ from $S_{i}$ yields a linear system\n$$\n\\mathbf{k}_{\\mathrm{eff}}=\\mathbf{A}\\,\\mathbf{f},\n$$\nto be solved under the physical constraints $\\mathbf{f}\\ge 0$, $k_{\\mathrm{cum}}(0)=0$, and $k_{\\mathrm{cum}}(\\infty)=k_{\\mathrm{bulk}}$, with $k_{\\mathrm{cum}}$ constructed from the cumulative sum of $\\mathbf{f}$. Because this is an ill-posed inverse problem of the first kind, stable reconstruction requires regularization (for example, Tikhonov regularization) and often benefits from monotonicity and smoothness priors consistent with the expected behavior of phonon scattering. The achievable resolution in $\\Lambda$ is limited by the span and diversity of the $\\{L_{i}\\}$ and by the shapes of the kernels $\\{S_{i}\\}$; if $\\{L_{i}\\}$ does not cover the full MFP support, only a partial $k_{\\mathrm{cum}}(\\Lambda)$ can be inferred, with bounds outside the sensitivity window enforced by monotonicity and the known limits at $\\Lambda=0$ and $\\Lambda\\to\\infty$.\n\nWe now evaluate each option.\n\nOption A: This option correctly defines $k_{\\mathrm{cum}}(\\Lambda)$ as the cumulative contribution to $k_{\\mathrm{bulk}}$ from modes with projected MFP up to $\\Lambda$, with the correct limiting values and monotonicity. It also correctly states the integral relation between $k_{\\mathrm{eff}}(L_{i})$ and the MFP spectrum via a known suppression kernel determined by geometry and boundary conditions, and it appropriately describes discretization and constrained regularized inversion to estimate $k_{\\mathrm{cum}}(\\Lambda)$ over the sensitivity range. Verdict — Correct.\n\nOption B: This option incorrectly identifies $k_{\\mathrm{cum}}(\\Lambda)$ as the cumulative heat capacity up to phonon frequency; the cumulative of heat capacity versus frequency is not, by itself, the cumulative thermal conductivity versus MFP. It further asserts that $\\mathrm{d}k_{\\mathrm{eff}}/\\mathrm{d}L$ equals the differential MFP contribution at $\\Lambda=L$ independent of geometry. In reality, the mapping from $L$ to $\\Lambda$ is mediated by a geometry-specific kernel $S(\\Lambda/L)$; there is no universal identity equating $\\mathrm{d}k_{\\mathrm{eff}}/\\mathrm{d}L$ to $\\mathrm{d}k/\\mathrm{d}\\Lambda$ evaluated at $\\Lambda=L$. Verdict — Incorrect.\n\nOption C: This option conflates size-dependent effective conductivity with ballistic conductance and asserts that integrating $k_{\\mathrm{eff}}(L)$ over $L$ yields $k_{\\mathrm{cum}}(\\Lambda)$ without kernels. The ballistic-to-diffusive crossover depends on the MFP distribution and geometry-specific suppression, and $k_{\\mathrm{eff}}(L)$ is a weighted aggregate, not a quantity whose integral over $L$ directly produces the cumulative MFP spectrum. Verdict — Incorrect.\n\nOption D: While one may parameterize transport by relaxation time $\\tau$ and relate $\\Lambda=|v_{x}|\\tau$ for each mode, this option incorrectly claims a universal relation $\\Lambda\\sim\\sqrt{\\alpha/\\omega}$ independent of geometry. The quantity $\\sqrt{\\alpha/\\omega}$ is a macroscopic thermal penetration depth for diffusive transport, not a phonon MFP, and using modulation frequency alone without a geometry-specific transport kernel does not uniquely determine $k_{\\mathrm{cum}}(\\Lambda)$. Knowledge of the appropriate kernel and geometry is essential. Verdict — Incorrect.\n\nOption E: This option correctly states that incomplete coverage of the MFP range by the set $\\{L_{i}\\}$ leads to partial reconstruction over the sensitivity window, with physically rigorous bounds elsewhere obtained by enforcing $k_{\\mathrm{cum}}(0)=0$, $k_{\\mathrm{cum}}(\\infty)=k_{\\mathrm{bulk}}$, and nonnegativity of $\\mathrm{d}k_{\\mathrm{cum}}/\\mathrm{d}\\Lambda$. It also correctly emphasizes that the inversion is ill-posed and requires regularization and physical constraints. Verdict — Correct.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{AE}$$", "id": "2469405"}]}
