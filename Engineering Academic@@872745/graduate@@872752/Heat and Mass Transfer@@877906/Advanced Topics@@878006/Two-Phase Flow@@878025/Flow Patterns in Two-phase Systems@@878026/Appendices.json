The air-water flow is likely to be slug flow, while the air-glycerol flow is likely to be stratified flow. This is because the high viscosity of glycerol damps the growth of interfacial waves, which are necessary for the formation of slugs.\n\nB.

The air-water flow is likely to be stratified flow, while the air-glycerol flow is likely to be slug flow. This is because the higher density of glycerol makes it more resistant to being moved by the air, causing the liquid to build up into slugs.\n\nD.

Established transition criteria and flow maps (for example, two-fluid model stability analyses and Taitel–Dukler-type maps) show that slugging requires interfacial waves in a stratified configuration to grow and bridge the cross-section. The onset of slugging from stratified/wavy stratified flow is controlled by a competition between gas-shear-induced Kelvin–Helmholtz-type amplification and viscous and gravitational stabilizing effects. Increased liquid viscosity $\\mu_{L}$ increases viscous damping of interfacial waves and therefore shifts the stratified-to-slug transition to higher $j_{G}$ (and/or $j_{L}$).\n\nTo formalize the viscosity effect, consider the superficial Reynolds numbers\n$$\nRe_{G}=\\dfrac{\\rho_{G} j_{G} D}{\\mu_{G}},\\qquad Re_{L}^{(W)}=\\dfrac{\\rho_{L}^{(W)} j_{L} D}{\\mu_{L}^{(W)}},\\qquad Re_{L}^{(G)}=\\dfrac{\\rho_{L}^{(G)} j_{L} D}{\\mu_{L}^{(G)}}.\n$$\nTheir ratio for the two liquids is\n$$\n\\dfrac{Re_{L}^{(G)}}{Re_{L}^{(W)}}=\\dfrac{\\rho_{L}^{(G)}\\,\\mu_{L}^{(W)}}{\\rho_{L}^{(W)}\\,\\mu_{L}^{(G)}}.\n$$\nGiven that $\\mu_{L}^{(G)}\\gg\\mu_{L}^{(W)}$ while $\\rho_{L}^{(G)}$ is only moderately larger than $\\rho_{L}^{(W)}$, one has $Re_{L}^{(G)}\\ll Re_{L}^{(W)}$, implying a much more viscous, strongly damped liquid layer for glycerol. In linear stability descriptions of the gas–liquid interface, the viscous damping term scales with $\\mu_{L}$ and reduces the wave growth rate; hence, at the same $j_{G}$ and $j_{L}$, interfacial waves that would amplify into slugs for a low-viscosity liquid (water) are suppressed for a high-viscosity liquid (glycerol), favoring stratified (smooth or mildly wavy) flow.\n\nThese principles allow the following discriminations among the options:\n- Option B is incorrect because regime depends on fluid properties in addition to $j_{G}$ and $j_{L}$; identical superficial velocities do not guarantee identical regimes when viscosities and densities differ.\n- Option D is incorrect because annular flow in a horizontal pipe requires sufficiently high $j_{G}$ and appropriate liquid loading; high liquid viscosity hinders atomization and entrainment and promotes stratification rather than annular flow at the same $j_{G},j_{L}$.\n- Option E is incorrect because bubble (dispersed) flow occurs at low gas velocities and small diameters; with the given phase throughputs in a $D$-scale pipe, water generally transitions to wavy/slug rather than remaining dispersed bubbles, and glycerol’s high viscosity further suppresses bubble dispersion.\n- Option C misattributes the effect to density; while density influences inertia and holdup, the dominant difference here is the much higher $\\mu_{L}$ for glycerol, which stabilizes the interface and disfavors slugging.\n\nTherefore, for the same $j_{G}$ and $j_{L}$, the low-viscosity air–water system is prone to wavy/slug flow, whereas the high-viscosity air–glycerol system is stabilized toward stratified flow, precisely as stated in Option A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1775269"}, {"introduction": "A central challenge in fluid mechanics is scaling observations from small-scale laboratory experiments to large-scale industrial applications.

The Eötvös number for the pipeline is very large (on the order of $10^4$), indicating strong gravitational dominance that promotes phase separation (stratified flow). The Eötvös number for the lab tube is significantly smaller (on the order of $10^1$), suggesting that surface tension forces are much more influential relative to gravity, which can disrupt stable stratification and favor the formation of bubbles or slugs.\n\nB. The Eötvös number for the pipeline is small (on the order of $10^1$), indicating that surface tension effects are dominant. The Eötvös number for the lab tube is very large (on the order of $10^4$), indicating that gravity is dominant. Therefore, the lab setup is a poor model for surface tension effects in the large pipeline.\n\nC. Both Eötvös numbers are much greater than 1, implying that inertial forces overwhelmingly dominate viscous forces in both systems. This leads to fully developed turbulent flow, making the flow regimes similar in both cases.\n\nD. The Eötvös number for the pipeline is approximately $7.8 \\times 10^4$ and for the tube is approximately 14.

This exercise [@problem_id:2521386] challenges the universal application of the hydraulic diameter, $D_h$, to two-phase systems in non-circular ducts. By reasoning from first principles, you will assess why this common simplification is physically consistent for annular flow but breaks down for stratified flow, highlighting the importance of ensuring modeling assumptions are compatible with the flow regime.", "problem": "A steady, incompressible, fully developed two-phase flow of a gas and a liquid proceeds through a horizontal rectangular duct of width $w$ and height $h$. The geometric hydraulic diameter is defined by $D_h = \\dfrac{2 w h}{w + h}$, obtained from the single-phase momentum balance with wall shear, $\\dfrac{dp}{dz} = \\dfrac{P \\,\\tau_w}{A}$ and the definition $D_h = \\dfrac{4A}{P}$, where $A$ is cross-sectional area and $P$ is wetted perimeter. In the separated-flow framework underpinning the Lockhart–Martinelli method, the two-phase frictional pressure gradient is estimated by combining single-phase-like frictional contributions for each phase at their respective mass fluxes and using single-phase friction-factor correlations.\n\nConsider two canonical separated-flow morphologies in this rectangular duct:\n- Stratified flow: a flat gas–liquid interface at a height $y$ from the bottom wall ($0 < y < h$) separates the liquid layer below from the gas layer above; the liquid wets the bottom wall and the lower portions of the side walls, while the gas wets the top wall and the upper portions of the side walls; there is an interfacial perimeter between phases.\n- Annular flow: a continuous liquid film wets the entire perimeter of the duct walls, and the gas flows as a core separated from the wall by the liquid film.\n\nWithout using any pre-packaged two-phase friction formulas, reason from the single-phase momentum balance and geometric definitions to judge the validity of simply substituting the geometric $D_h$ of the dry duct into Lockhart–Martinelli calculations for these two regimes. In particular, address whether a single $D_h$ can consistently play the role of the characteristic length for both phases’ friction factors and for the scaling of wall and interfacial shear in each regime.\n\nWhich of the following statements is most accurate?\n\nA. Using the dry-duct hydraulic diameter $D_h$ to extend Lockhart–Martinelli to the rectangular duct is generally acceptable for annular flow, because the wall is fully wetted and the shear scales with $4A/P$, but it is generally inappropriate for stratified flow, where each phase has its own wetted perimeter and interfacial length, so a single $D_h$ cannot represent both phases consistently.\n\nB. For stratified flow with a flat interface at mid-height ($y = h/2$), substituting $D_h$ makes the Lockhart–Martinelli prediction exact for frictional pressure drop, since each phase then has the same hydraulic diameter as the dry duct.\n\nC. Using $D_h$ is never appropriate in any two-phase Lockhart–Martinelli calculation, because the relevant length scale is always the liquid film thickness or bubble diameter, not the duct geometry.\n\nD. As long as the Reynolds number of each phase exceeds $10^4$, the choice of $D_h$ or any other geometric length scale is immaterial for Lockhart–Martinelli predictions in both stratified and annular flows, so $D_h$ is equally valid in both regimes.", "solution": "The fundamental principle of the hydraulic diameter, $D_h$, stems from the single-phase momentum balance for fully developed flow in a duct of arbitrary cross-section, $A$, and wetted perimeter, $P$. The definition $D_h = \\frac{4A}{P}$ allows the pressure gradient equation, $-\\frac{dp}{dz} = \\frac{\\tau_w P}{A}$, to be cast in a form analogous to that for a circular pipe, facilitating the use of standard friction factor correlations. The Lockhart–Martinelli method extends this by using the dry duct's overall geometric parameters for fictitious single-phase flows. We must evaluate if this is physically consistent for annular and stratified flows.\n\n**Analysis of Annular Flow**\nIn annular flow, the liquid forms a film that wets the entire wall perimeter, $P$. The pressure drop acts on the total cross-section $A$, and the resisting shear force is exerted by the liquid on the entire wetted perimeter $P$. A momentum balance on the entire fluid gives $-\\frac{dp}{dz} = \\frac{\\tau_{wL} P}{A} = \\frac{4\\tau_{wL}}{D_h}$, where $\\tau_{wL}$ is the wall shear stress in the liquid. This equation's form is identical to the single-phase balance, and it naturally relates the pressure drop to the overall duct geometry through $D_h$. Therefore, using the dry duct's hydraulic diameter is a geometrically consistent and physically reasonable simplification for the overall pressure drop calculation in the Lockhart–Martinelli framework.\n\n**Analysis of Stratified Flow**\nIn stratified flow, the situation is fundamentally different. The liquid and gas phases occupy distinct areas ($A_L$, $A_G$) and contact distinct wall perimeters ($P_L$, $P_G$). They also share an interfacial perimeter, $P_i$. The momentum balance for each phase involves its specific wetted perimeter and the interfacial shear:\n- Liquid: $A_L (-\\frac{dp}{dz}) = \\tau_{wL} P_L + \\tau_i P_i$\n- Gas: $A_G (-\\frac{dp}{dz}) = \\tau_{wG} P_G - \\tau_i P_i$\nBecause each phase interacts with a different set of boundaries, a single hydraulic diameter for the entire duct cannot consistently represent the geometry for calculating frictional losses in both phases. It is more physically meaningful to define separate hydraulic diameters for each phase, such as $D_{h,L} = \\frac{4A_L}{P_L}$ and $D_{h,G} = \\frac{4A_G}{P_G}$. Using the single dry-duct $D_h$ for both phases in the Lockhart–Martinelli calculation ignores the true geometric configuration of the stratified system and is therefore physically inappropriate.\n\n**Conclusion**\nThe analysis shows that using the dry-duct $D_h$ is physically consistent for annular flow but not for stratified flow. This reasoning directly supports option A. Option B is incorrect because even if phase hydraulic diameters happen to match $D_h$, the presence of a mobile, shear-transmitting interface invalidates the single-phase analogy. Option C is too strong, as $D_h$ is a relevant parameter for annular flow in this context. Option D is incorrect because the characteristic length scale is fundamentally important in pressure drop calculations, regardless of the Reynolds number.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2521386"}]}
