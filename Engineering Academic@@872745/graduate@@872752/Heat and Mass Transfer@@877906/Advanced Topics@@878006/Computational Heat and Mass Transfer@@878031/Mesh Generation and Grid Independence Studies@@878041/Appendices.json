We may proceed.\n\nThe objective is to derive an expression for the relative error $\\varepsilon$ between a non-conservative and a conservative finite-volume approximation for heat flux at a material interface.\n\nFirst, we derive the conservative expression for the interfacial heat flux per unit area, $q_f$, at the location $x=0$. The foundation of this derivation is the enforcement of heat flux continuity, which is a direct consequence of energy conservation for one-dimensional, steady-state heat conduction with no sources.

The data provided are complete and consistent for the analysis requested. Thus, the problem is valid, and a solution will be provided.\n\nThe fundamental principle governing the continuous problem is the conservation of energy. For a steady, one-dimensional, source-free, and diffusion-free flow, the integral energy balance over any control volume $\\Omega$ simplifies to the statement that the net convective enthalpy flux across its boundary $\\partial \\Omega$ is zero:\n$$\n\\oint_{\\partial \\Omega} \\dot{m} c_p T \\cdot \\boldsymbol{n} \\, \\mathrm{d}A = 0\n$$\nwhere $\\dot{m} = \\rho \\boldsymbol{u}$ is the mass flux vector. This implies that for the entire domain of length $L$, the enthalpy flux entering at $x=0$ must equal the enthalpy flux exiting at $x=L$. Given that the problem specifies pure advection, the temperature $T$ must be constant throughout the domain, equal to the inlet temperature $T_{\\mathrm{in}} = 300\\,\\mathrm{K}$. Since $c_p$ is also constant, the energy conservation law, $(\\rho u A c_p T)|_{x=L} - (\\rho u A c_p T)|_{x=0} = 0$, reduces to the mass conservation law: $(\\rho u A)|_{x=L} - (\\rho u A)|_{x=0} = 0$. This means the mass flow rate, $m = \\rho u A$, must be constant throughout the duct. A valid numerical discretization must respect this property.\n\n**Part 1: Global Heat Balance Error**\n\nWe first compute the mass fluxes at the control volume faces using the non-conservative interpolation scheme provided. The data are: $\\rho_1 = 1.0\\,\\mathrm{kg}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-3}$, $u_1 = 1.0\\,\\mathrm{m}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$ for the left cell; $\\rho_2 = 0.8\\,\\mathrm{kg}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-3}$, $u_2 = 1.2\\,\\mathrm{m}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$ for the right cell; and $A = 1\\,\\mathrm{m}^2$.\n\nThe mass flux at the inlet face ($x=0$) is:\n$$\nm_{\\mathrm{in}} = \\rho_1 u_1 A = (1.0\\,\\mathrm{kg}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-3})(1.0\\,\\mathrm{m}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1})(1\\,\\mathrm{m}^2) = 1.0\\,\\mathrm{kg}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}\n$$\n\nThe mass flux at the outlet face ($x=L$) is:\n$$\nm_{\\mathrm{out}} = \\rho_2 u_2 A = (0.8\\,\\mathrm{kg}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-3})(1.2\\,\\mathrm{m}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1})(1\\,\\mathrm{m}^2) = 0.96\\,\\mathrm{kg}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}\n$$\n\nThe global heat balance error is defined as the net outward convective enthalpy flux, $Q_{\\mathrm{out}} - Q_{\\mathrm{in}}$. The inlet and outlet heat fluxes are $Q_{\\mathrm{in}} = c_p m_{\\mathrm{in}} T_{\\mathrm{in}}$ and $Q_{\\mathrm{out}} = c_p m_{\\mathrm{out}} T_{\\mathrm{in}}$.

It violates the discrete equivalent of the continuity equation, $\\nabla \\cdot (\\rho \\boldsymbol{u}) = 0$. For a proper FVM scheme, summing the flux balances over all control volumes should result in the cancellation of all internal face fluxes, leaving only the boundary fluxes. This requires that the flux leaving one cell face is identical to the flux entering the adjacent cell through the same face. Here, the defined scheme does not satisfy this. For instance, the net mass flow for the first control volume is $m_{12} - m_{\\mathrm{in}}$, and for the second is $m_{\\mathrm{out}} - m_{12}$. The sum of these, which represents the global mass imbalance, is $(m_{12} - m_{\\mathrm{in}}) + (m_{\\mathrm{out}} - m_{12}) = m_{\\mathrm{out}} - m_{\\mathrm{in}} = -0.04\\,\\mathrm{kg}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$. This spurious destruction of mass leads directly to a spurious destruction of energy, causing the calculated non-zero heat balance error.\n\n**Part 2: Corrective Flux Reconstruction**\n\nTo enforce conservation, we must ensure that the mass flux is constant across all faces. We introduce a single corrected mass flux value, $m^\\star$, which will replace the individually calculated fluxes at the inlet, interior, and outlet faces. This correction ensures that the net mass flux for each control volume is zero, thus satisfying the discrete continuity equation.\n\nThe problem requires us to find the value of $m^\\star$ that minimizes the sum of squared deviations from the original, non-conservative face fluxes. First, we compute the original flux at the interior face ($x=L/2$):\n$$\nm_{12} = \\frac{1}{2}(\\rho_1 u_1 + \\rho_2 u_2) A = \\frac{1}{2}((1.0)(1.0) + (0.8)(1.2))(1) = \\frac{1}{2}(1.0 + 0.96) = 0.98\\,\\mathrm{kg}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}\n$$\n\nThe objective function to minimize is the sum of squared errors, $S$:\n$$\nS(m^\\star) = (m^\\star - m_{\\mathrm{in}})^2 + (m^\\star - m_{12})^2 + (m^\\star - m_{\\mathrm{out}})^2\n$$\nTo find the minimum, we differentiate $S$ with respect to $m^\\star$ and set the result to zero:\n$$\n\\frac{\\mathrm{d}S}{\\mathrm{d}m^\\star} = 2(m^\\star - m_{\\mathrm{in}}) + 2(m^\\star - m_{12}) + 2(m^\\star - m_{\\mathrm{out}}) = 0\n$$\nSolving for $m^\\star$:\n$$\n3m^\\star - (m_{\\mathrm{in}} + m_{12} + m_{\\mathrm{out}}) = 0\n$$\n$$\nm^\\star = \\frac{1}{3}(m_{\\mathrm{in}} + m_{12} + m_{\\mathrm{out}})\n$$\nThis result shows that the optimal corrected mass flux, in a least-squares sense, is the arithmetic mean of the original three non-conservative face fluxes.\n\nWe now substitute the numerical values for the original fluxes:\n$$\nm^\\star = \\frac{1}{3}(1.0 + 0.98 + 0.96) = \\frac{2.94}{3} = 0.98\\,\\mathrm{kg}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}\n$$\nThe problem asks for this value to be reported to four significant figures.\n\n$$\nm^\\star = 0.9800\\,\\mathrm{kg}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}\n$$\nThis corrected flux $m^\\star$ provides a mass-conservative reconstruction that is closest to the original, flawed interpolation in a least-squares sense.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{0.9800}\n$$", "id": "2506351"}, {"introduction": "Accurately predicting heat transfer in turbulent flows hinges on properly resolving the extremely thin boundary layers near solid walls.

The accuracy of the predicted $Nu$ is thus directly dependent on the accuracy of the computed wall heat flux.\n\nThe wall heat flux is given by Fourier's law at the wall:\n$$q''_w = -k \\left. \\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial y} \\right|_{y=0}$$\nIn a cell-centered finite volume method, this gradient is typically approximated using a first-order, one-sided difference scheme:\n$$q''_{w, \\text{num}} = -k \\frac{T_1 - T_w}{y_1 - 0} = k \\frac{T_w - T_1}{y_1}$$\nwhere $T_1$ is the temperature at the first cell center, located at $y=y_1$.\n\nTo analyze the accuracy of this approximation, we must examine the behavior of the temperature profile $T(y)$ very close to the wall. The Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) energy equation for steady, incompressible flow with constant properties is:\n$$\\frac{\\partial (U_j T)}{\\partial x_j} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x_j} \\left( \\alpha \\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial x_j} - \\overline{u'_j T'} \\right) + S_T$$\nwhere $\\alpha = k/(\\rho c_p)$ is the thermal diffusivity and $-\\overline{u'_j T'}$ is the turbulent heat flux. For a two-dimensional boundary layer, and very close to the wall ($y \\to 0$), convective terms are negligible. The equation simplifies to a balance between molecular and turbulent diffusion in the wall-normal direction:\n$$\\frac{d}{dy} \\left( \\alpha \\frac{dT}{dy} - \\overline{v'T'} \\right) \\approx 0$$\nThis implies that the total heat flux, $q_{total} = -k \\frac{dT}{dy} + \\rho c_p \\overline{v'T'}$, is approximately constant and equal to the wall heat flux $q''_w$.\n\nWithin the viscous sublayer ($y^+ \\lesssim 5$), turbulent fluctuations are heavily damped by viscous effects. Specifically, the wall-normal velocity fluctuation $v'$ must satisfy $v' \\propto y^2$ due to continuity and no-slip conditions, and temperature fluctuations near an isothermal wall scale as $T' \\propto y$. This leads to the turbulent heat flux scaling as $\\overline{v'T'} \\propto y^3$ or higher powers of $y$. Consequently, the turbulent heat flux is negligible compared to the molecular heat flux for very small $y$.\n\nThe energy equation in the viscous sublayer thus reduces to:\n$$\\frac{d}{dy}\\left( k \\frac{dT}{dy} \\right) \\approx 0 \\quad \\implies \\quad -k \\frac{dT}{dy} \\approx \\text{constant} = q''_w$$\nThis indicates that the temperature profile is nearly linear with respect to $y$:\n$$T(y) \\approx T_w - \\frac{q''_w}{k} y$$\nIf the temperature profile were perfectly linear, the finite difference approximation $q''_{w, \\text{num}} = k(T_w - T_1)/y_1$ would be exact, because substituting the linear profile gives $T_1 = T_w - (q''_w/k)y_1$, and thus $q''_{w, \\text{num}} = k(T_w - (T_w - (q''_w/k)y_1))/y_1 = q''_w$.\n\nThe error in the numerical approximation arises from the deviation of the true temperature profile from a perfect line. To find the leading-order error, we use a Taylor series expansion of $T(y)$ around $y=0$:\n$$T(y) = T(0) + T'(0)y + \\frac{T''(0)}{2}y^2 + \\frac{T'''(0)}{6}y^3 + \\mathcal{O}(y^4)$$\nThe numerically approximated gradient is $\\frac{T(y_1)-T(0)}{y_1} = T'(0) + \\frac{T''(0)}{2}y_1 + \\frac{T'''(0)}{6}y_1^2 + \\mathcal{O}(y_1^3)$.\nFrom the simplified energy equation, $\\frac{d^2 T}{dy^2} = \\frac{1}{\\alpha} \\frac{d}{dy}(\\overline{v'T'})$. Since $\\overline{v'T'} \\propto y^3$, its derivative $\\frac{d}{dy}(\\overline{v'T'})$ scales as $y^2$. This means $T''(y) \\propto y^2$ and importantly, $T''(0)=0$.\nThe Taylor series is therefore $T(y) = T_w + T'(0)y + \\mathcal{O}(y^3)$. A more careful analysis of the energy balance including the $\\overline{v'T'} \\propto y^3$ term actually yields $T'''(0)=0$ and a leading non-linear term of $\\mathcal{O}(y^4)$. Let's assume the more general case based on the Taylor series itself. With $T''(0)=0$, the error in the gradient calculation is:\n$$\\text{Error} = \\left(\\frac{T(y_1)-T_w}{y_1}\\right) - T'(0) = \\frac{T'''(0)}{6}y_1^2 + \\mathcal{O}(y_1^3)$$\nThe error in the computed wall heat flux $q''_{w, \\text{num}}$ is thus of second order with respect to the first cell height $y_1$.\n$$\\text{Error}(q''_w) \\propto y_1^2$$\nExpressing this in wall units, the relative error in the Nusselt number prediction scales with the square of the non-dimensional wall distance of the first cell center:\n$$\\frac{\\Delta Nu}{Nu} \\propto (y_1^+)^2$$\nBecause the error depends on the square of $y_1^+$, it remains very small for values of $y_1^+ \\lesssim 5$. For instance, doubling $y_1^+$ from $1$ to $2$ (both well within the viscous sublayer) would quadruple the discretization error, but the absolute error, being proportional to a small quantity squared, is still small. This demonstrates a relative insensitivity of the predicted heat transfer to the precise placement of the first grid point, provided it is kept within the viscous sublayer. The strict requirement of $y^+ \\approx 1$ is often more critical for accurately resolving the velocity field and the turbulence quantities ($k$ and $\\omega$), whose profiles exhibit stronger non-linearity closer to the wall.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{3.556 \\times 10^{-5}}$$", "id": "2506403"}]}
