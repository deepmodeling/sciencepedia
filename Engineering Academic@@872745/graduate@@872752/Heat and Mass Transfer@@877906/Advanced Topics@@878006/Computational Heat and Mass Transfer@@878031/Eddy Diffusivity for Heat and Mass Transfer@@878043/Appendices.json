The problem statement provides all necessary local mean gradients and turbulent fluxes and specifies the use of a local gradient-diffusion closure model. The fluid is an ideal gas.\n\nThe local gradient-diffusion hypothesis posits a linear relationship between turbulent fluxes and the corresponding mean gradients, analogous to molecular diffusion laws. The proportionality constants are the eddy (or turbulent) transport coefficients.\n\nFirst, let's define the turbulent shear stress, $\\tau_{t}$, in terms of the Reynolds shear correlation, $\\overline{u^{\\prime} v^{\\prime}}$. The shear stress acting in the $x$-direction on a plane with its normal in the $y$-direction is $\\tau_{yx} = \\tau_{t} = -\\rho \\overline{u^{\\prime} v^{\\prime}}$.

We may proceed to the solution.\n\n### Derivation of the Correct Procedure\n\nThe central feature of this problem is the presence of \"non-negligible density fluctuations\". In such flows, standard Reynolds averaging leads to averaged equations with numerous unclosed correlation terms involving density fluctuations (e.g., $\\overline{\\rho' u_i'}$), which are intractable. The formally correct and standard procedure is to use Favre (density-weighted) averaging.\n\nLet a generic flow variable be $\\phi$. The Favre average is defined as $\\tilde{\\phi} = \\overline{\\rho \\phi} / \\bar{\\rho}$, where $\\bar{\\cdot}$ denotes the conventional Reynolds average (here, an average over time and the homogeneous $x, z$ planes). The fluctuation is then $\\phi'' = \\phi - \\tilde{\\phi}$. By definition, $\\overline{\\rho \\phi''} = 0$, which greatly simplifies the form of the averaged conservation equations.\n\nThe gradient-diffusion hypothesis (GDH) provides a closure model for the turbulent fluxes by relating them to the mean field gradients. For a fully developed channel flow where mean gradients exist only in the $y$-direction, the GDH takes the following form using Favre-averaged quantities.\n\n$1$. **Turbulent Momentum Flux (Shear Stress):** The turbulent shear stress component responsible for momentum transfer in the $y$-direction is $\\overline{\\rho u''v''}$. The GDH relates this to the mean velocity gradient:\n$$-\\overline{\\rho u''v''} = \\mu_t \\frac{\\partial \\tilde{U}}{\\partial y}$$\nwhere $\\mu_t$ is the turbulent dynamic viscosity. The turbulent kinematic viscosity, $\\nu_t$, is defined as $\\nu_t = \\mu_t / \\bar{\\rho}$. Therefore:\n$$\\nu_t(y) = -\\frac{\\overline{\\rho u''v''}(y)}{\\bar{\\rho}(y) \\frac{\\partial \\tilde{U}}{\\partial y}(y)}$$\n\n$2$. **Turbulent Heat Flux:** The turbulent enthalpy flux is $\\overline{\\rho v''h''}$. For an ideal gas with constant specific heat $c_p$, the enthalpy is $h = c_p T$. The Favre-averaged enthalpy is $\\tilde{h} = c_p \\tilde{T}$, and the fluctuation is $h'' = c_p T''$. The turbulent heat flux is modeled as:\n$$-\\overline{\\rho v''h''} = -\\overline{\\rho v'' c_p T''} = -c_p \\overline{\\rho v''T''} = \\bar{\\rho} \\alpha_t \\frac{\\partial \\tilde{h}}{\\partial y} = \\bar{\\rho} \\alpha_t c_p \\frac{\\partial \\tilde{T}}{\\partial y}$$\nHere, $\\alpha_t$ is the turbulent thermal diffusivity. Solving for $\\alpha_t$ yields:\n$$\\alpha_t(y) = -\\frac{\\overline{\\rho v''T''}(y)}{\\bar{\\rho}(y) \\frac{\\partial \\tilde{T}}{\\partial y}(y)}$$\nThe problem states that $c_p$ is constant, justifying the direct relation between temperature and enthalpy fluxes and diffusivities.\n\n$3$. **Turbulent Mass Flux:** The turbulent mass flux of the passive species is $\\overline{\\rho v''Y''}$. The GDH for this flux is:\n$$-\\overline{\\rho v''Y''} = \\bar{\\rho} D_t \\frac{\\partial \\tilde{Y}}{\\partial y}$$\nwhere $D_t$ is the turbulent mass diffusivity. Solving for $D_t$:\n$$D_t(y) = -\\frac{\\overline{\\rho v''Y''}(y)}{\\bar{\\rho}(y) \\frac{\\partial \\tilde{Y}}{\\partial y}(y)}$$\n\n$4$. **Turbulent Prandtl and Schmidt Numbers:** With the eddy diffusivities defined, we compute their ratios:\n$$Pr_t(y) = \\frac{\\nu_t(y)}{\\alpha_t(y)}$$\n$$Sc_t(y) = \\frac{\\nu_t(y)}{D_t(y)}$$\n\nA critical practical point is that the GDH and the derived formulae for diffusivities are undefined or numerically unstable where the mean gradients ($\\partial \\tilde{U}/\\partial y$, $\\partial \\tilde{T}/\\partial y$, $\\partial \\tilde{Y}/\\partial y$) approach zero. This occurs, for example, at the channel centerline for symmetric profiles. A robust procedure must exclude such points from the calculation.\n\nWe now evaluate each option against this rigorously derived procedure.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**Option A:** This procedure proposes using Reynolds averages ($\\bar{\\cdot}$, $\\cdot'$) for velocity flux but mixed notation ($\\tilde{T}$, $\\tilde{Y}$) for scalar gradients. The formula $\\nu_t=-\\overline{u'v'}/(\\partial \\bar{U}/\\partial y)$ is the definition for incompressible (constant density) flow. For a variable-density flow ($M\\approx 0.7$ with heating), this is fundamentally incorrect as it neglects the correlations with density fluctuations that are naturally handled by Favre averaging. The justification that this \"avoids density weighting to minimize experimental noise\" is an admission of using an incorrect physical model for supposed convenience, which is unacceptable. Scientific correctness is not optional.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**Option B:** This procedure correctly identifies the necessity of Favre averaging ($\\tilde{\\phi}$, $\\phi''$) for this variable-density problem. It proposes computing the turbulent dynamic viscosity $\\mu_t=-\\dfrac{\\overline{\\rho u''v''}}{\\dfrac{\\partial \\tilde{U}}{\\partial y}}$ and subsequently the kinematic viscosity $\\nu_t = \\mu_t / \\bar{\\rho}$. It provides the correct expressions for the turbulent thermal diffusivity $\\alpha_t=-\\dfrac{\\overline{\\rho v'' T''}}{\\bar{\\rho}\\dfrac{\\partial \\tilde{T}}{\\partial y}}$ and turbulent mass diffusivity $D_t=-\\dfrac{\\overline{\\rho v'' Y''}}{\\bar{\\rho}\\dfrac{\\partial \\tilde{Y}}{\\partial y}}$. These expressions directly match our derivation from first principles. Subsequently, it correctly forms the ratios $Pr_t=\\nu_t/\\alpha_t$ and $Sc_t=\\nu_t/D_t$. Crucially, it includes the necessary step of excluding regions where mean gradients are small to avoid numerical artifacts. This entire procedure is consistent, rigorous, and practical.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**Option C:** This procedure errs by conflating total flux with turbulent flux. The eddy diffusivity $\\alpha_t$ is defined to model the *turbulent* heat flux component ($\\overline{\\rho v''h''}$), not the *total* heat flux, which also includes the molecular contribution ($-k \\partial T/\\partial y$) and is affected by other terms in the full energy equation. Defining $\\alpha_t = -q_y/(\\partial \\tilde{T}/\\partial y)$, where $q_y$ is the total flux, is a violation of the fundamental definition of eddy diffusivity. The same logical error applies to the proposed calculation of $D_t$ from the total species flux $j_{Y,y}$. While estimating eddy viscosity from the total shear stress balance is a valid technique on its own, the proposed methods for $\\alpha_t$ and $D_t$ are fundamentally flawed.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**Option D:** This procedure is nonsensical. It proposes to calculate diffusivities from streamwise fluxes and streamwise gradients, e.g., $\\alpha_t=-\\overline{\\rho u''T''}/(\\bar{\\rho}\\dfrac{\\partial \\tilde{T}}{\\partial x})$. However, the problem explicitly states that the flow is fully developed and mean fields vary only with $y$. This means that mean streamwise gradients like $\\dfrac{\\partial \\tilde{T}}{\\partial x}$ are identically zero. The proposed formulas thus involve division by zero. Furthermore, the proposed formula for eddy viscosity, $\\nu_t=-\\overline{\\rho u''v''}/(\\bar{\\rho}\\dfrac{\\partial \\tilde{V}}{\\partial y})$, relates the shear stress to the gradient of the mean wall-normal velocity $\\tilde{V}$. In a fully developed channel flow, $\\tilde{V}$ is zero everywhere, so its gradient $\\dfrac{\\partial \\tilde{V}}{\\partial y}$ is also zero. The correct term is the gradient of the mean streamwise velocity, $\\dfrac{\\partial \\tilde{U}}{\\partial y}$. This option is contradictory to the problem statement and physically incorrect.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2536174"}]}
