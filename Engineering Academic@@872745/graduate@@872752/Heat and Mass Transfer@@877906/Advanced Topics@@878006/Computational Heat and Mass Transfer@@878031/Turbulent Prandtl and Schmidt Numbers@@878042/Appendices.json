The problem is well-posed and scientifically sound, so we proceed with the derivation.\n\nThe starting point is the definition of the wall-normal turbulent heat flux given in the problem statement:\n$$\nq_{t,y} = \\rho c_p \\overline{v' T'}\n$$\nHere, $\\rho$ is the constant fluid density, $c_p$ is the specific heat at constant pressure, and $\\overline{v' T'}$ is the time-averaged correlation between the wall-normal velocity fluctuation $v'$ and the temperature fluctuation $T'$. This correlation is also known as the turbulent kinematic heat flux in the $y$-direction. Our objective is to find an expression for this term that does not involve fluctuating quantities directly but relates them to mean flow properties.\n\nTo close this expression, we invoke the local gradient-diffusion hypothesis for passive-scalar transport, as instructed. This hypothesis is a cornerstone of Reynolds-averaged turbulence modeling and is analogous to Fick's law for molecular diffusion or Fourier's law for molecular heat conduction. It posits that the turbulent flux of a scalar quantity is proportional to the gradient of the mean value of that scalar. For the transport of thermal energy, with temperature $T$ acting as the passive scalar, the turbulent kinematic heat flux $\\overline{v' T'}$ is modeled as:\n$$\n\\overline{v' T'} = - \\alpha_t \\frac{\\partial \\tilde{T}}{\\partial y}\n$$\nIn this expression, $\\tilde{T}$ is the time-averaged mean temperature, $\\frac{\\partial \\tilde{T}}{\\partial y}$ is the mean temperature gradient in the wall-normal direction, and $\\alpha_t$ is the turbulent thermal diffusivity, also called the eddy thermal diffusivity. The negative sign indicates that the turbulent transport of heat occurs down the mean temperature gradient, from regions of higher mean temperature to regions of lower mean temperature.\n\nThe turbulent thermal diffusivity $\\alpha_t$ is not a fluid property but a characteristic of the turbulent flow state. It must be modeled. The problem provides the means to do this by introducing the turbulent Prandtl number, $Pr_t$. The turbulent Prandtl number is defined as the ratio of the turbulent (eddy) kinematic viscosity, $\\nu_t$, to the turbulent (eddy) thermal diffusivity, $\\alpha_t$:\n$$\nPr_t = \\frac{\\nu_t}{\\alpha_t}\n$$\nThe turbulent kinematic viscosity $\\nu_t$ arises from the Boussinesq eddy-viscosity closure for momentum transport, $-\\rho \\overline{u'v'} = \\rho \\nu_t (\\partial \\tilde{u}/\\partial y)$, which models the turbulent shear stress analogously to how we are modeling the turbulent heat flux. The problem specifies that $Pr_t$ is constant. This is a common simplification known as the Reynolds analogy, which assumes that the mechanisms for turbulent transport of momentum and heat are similar.\n\nFrom the definition of $Pr_t$, we can express the turbulent thermal diffusivity $\\alpha_t$ in terms of the turbulent kinematic viscosity $\\nu_t$ and the turbulent Prandtl number $Pr_t$:\n$$\n\\alpha_t = \\frac{\\nu_t}{Pr_t}\n$$\nNow, we substitute this expression for $\\alpha_t$ back into the gradient-diffusion model for the turbulent kinematic heat flux:\n$$\n\\overline{v' T'} = - \\left( \\frac{\\nu_t}{Pr_t} \\right) \\frac{\\partial \\tilde{T}}{\\partial y}\n$$\nThis provides a closed model for the correlation $\\overline{v' T'}$ in terms of mean flow quantities and turbulence model parameters.\n\nThe final step is to substitute this result into the original definition of the wall-normal turbulent heat flux, $q_{t,y}$.\n$$\nq_{t,y} = \\rho c_p \\overline{v' T'} = \\rho c_p \\left( - \\frac{\\nu_t}{Pr_t} \\frac{\\partial \\tilde{T}}{\\partial y} \\right)\n$$\nRearranging the terms gives the desired closed-form constitutive relation:\n$$\nq_{t,y} = - \\frac{\\rho c_p \\nu_t}{Pr_t} \\frac{\\partial \\tilde{T}}{\\partial y}\n$$\nThis expression relates the turbulent heat flux $q_{t,y}$ to the local mean temperature gradient $\\frac{\\partial \\tilde{T}}{\\partial y}$, the fluid properties $\\rho$ and $c_p$, and the turbulence model parameters $\\nu_t$ and $Pr_t$, as required by the problem statement.

For simplicity, we denote $q''_w$ as $q''$.\n$$\nq'' = -\\rho c_p (\\alpha + \\alpha_t(y)) \\frac{dT}{dy}\n$$\nThis is a first-order ordinary differential equation for the temperature profile $T(y)$. We separate variables to solve for $T(y)$:\n$$\ndT = -\\frac{q''}{\\rho c_p} \\frac{1}{\\alpha + \\alpha_t(y)} dy\n$$\nWe integrate this equation across the boundary layer, from $y=0$ where $T(0)=T_w$ to $y=\\delta$ where $T(\\delta)=T_b$:\n$$\n\\int_{T_w}^{T_b} dT' = \\int_0^\\delta \\left(-\\frac{q''}{\\rho c_p} \\frac{1}{\\alpha + \\alpha_t(y')}\\right) dy'\n$$\n$$\nT_b - T_w = -\\frac{q''}{\\rho c_p} \\int_0^\\delta \\frac{dy'}{\\alpha + \\alpha_t(y')}\n$$\nWe now solve for the wall heat flux $q''$:\n$$\nq'' = -\\frac{\\rho c_p (T_b - T_w)}{\\int_0^\\delta \\frac{dy}{\\alpha + \\alpha_t(y)}} = \\frac{\\rho c_p (T_w - T_b)}{\\int_0^\\delta \\frac{dy}{\\alpha + \\alpha_t(y)}}\n$$\nThe Stanton number is defined as $\\mathrm{St} = \\frac{q''}{\\rho c_p U_e (T_w - T_b)}$. Substituting our derived expression for $q''$ yields:\n$$\n\\mathrm{St} = \\frac{1}{\\rho c_p U_e (T_w - T_b)} \\left[ \\frac{\\rho c_p (T_w - T_b)}{\\int_0^\\delta \\frac{dy}{\\alpha + \\alpha_t(y)}} \\right]\n$$\nThe terms $\\rho c_p (T_w - T_b)$ cancel, leading to the final expression for the Stanton number:\n$$\n\\mathrm{St} = \\frac{1}{U_e \\int_0^\\delta \\frac{dy}{\\alpha + \\alpha_t(y)}}\n$$\nThe integrand depends on the turbulent thermal diffusivity $\\alpha_t(y)$, which is specified through the closure models:\n$$\n\\alpha_t(y) = \\frac{\\nu_t(y)}{\\mathrm{Pr}_t(y)}\n$$\nwith eddy viscosity $\\nu_t(y)$ and turbulent Prandtl number $\\mathrm{Pr}_t(y)$ given in the problem statement. The derived properties, kinematic viscosity $\\nu = \\mu/\\rho$ and molecular thermal diffusivity $\\alpha=k/(\\rho c_p)$, must first be computed from the given fluid properties.\n\n**Numerical Implementation**\n\nThe algorithmic task requires the numerical evaluation of the integral for each test case and for each of the two $\\mathrm{Pr}_t$ models.\n1.  Compute the constant properties $\\nu$ and $\\alpha$.\n2.  For each test case $(U_e, u_\\tau, \\delta)$:\n3.  Define the eddy viscosity function $\\nu_t(y)$ based on the van Driest model.\n4.  For the constant $\\mathrm{Pr}_t$ model, the integrand is $f_1(y) = 1/(\\alpha + \\nu_t(y)/0.85)$.\n5.  For the variable $\\mathrm{Pr}_t$ model, define $\\mathrm{Pr}_t(y) = 0.85 + 0.15 \\exp(-\\nu_t(y)/(5\\nu))$. The integrand is $f_2(y) = 1/(\\alpha + \\nu_t(y)/\\mathrm{Pr}_t(y))$.\n6.  The integrals $I_1 = \\int_0^\\delta f_1(y) dy$ and $I_2 = \\int_0^\\delta f_2(y) dy$ are computed using numerical quadrature.\n7.  The Stanton numbers are then calculated as $\\mathrm{St}_{\\text{const}} = 1/(U_e I_1)$ and $\\mathrm{St}_{\\text{var}} = 1/(U_e I_2)$.\n8.  The relative difference is computed as $(\\mathrm{St}_{\\text{var}} - \\mathrm{St}_{\\text{const}})/\\mathrm{St}_{\\text{const}}$.\nThe results for each case are rounded and collated into the specified output format.
