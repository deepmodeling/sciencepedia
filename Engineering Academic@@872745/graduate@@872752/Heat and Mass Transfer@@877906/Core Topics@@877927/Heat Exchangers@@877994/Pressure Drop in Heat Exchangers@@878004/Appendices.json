Substituting the expression for the velocity $v$:\n$$\\mathrm{Re} = \\frac{\\rho d}{\\mu} \\left( \\frac{4 Q_T}{\\pi d^2 N_t} \\right) = \\frac{4 \\rho Q_T}{\\pi \\mu d N_t}$$\nSince the quantities $\\rho$, $Q_T$, $\\mu$, and $d$ are all fixed constants, we can express the Reynolds number's dependence on the number of tubes $N_t$ as:\n$$\\mathrm{Re} \\propto \\frac{1}{N_t} \\quad \\text{or} \\quad \\mathrm{Re} \\propto N_t^{-1}$$\nThis is the scaling law for the per-tube Reynolds number.\n\nNext, we analyze the pressure drop, $\\Delta p$. The Darcy-Weisbach equation for pressure drop in a fully developed flow through a straight tube of length $L$ is:\n$$\\Delta p = f \\frac{L}{d} \\frac{\\rho v^2}{2}$$\nwhere $f$ is the Darcy friction factor. We substitute the expression for velocity $v$:\n$$\\Delta p = f \\frac{L}{d} \\frac{\\rho}{2} \\left( \\frac{4 Q_T}{\\pi d^2 N_t} \\right)^2 = f \\left( \\frac{8 \\rho L Q_T^2}{\\pi^2 d^5} \\right) N_t^{-2}$$\nThe problem states that for the turbulent regime, the friction factor is given by a power-law correlation of the form $f = a \\, \\mathrm{Re}^{-m}$, where $a$ and $m$ are positive constants.

It is a standard problem in the analysis of fluid flow and pressure drop in heat exchangers. We may proceed directly to the derivation and solution.\n\nThe first task is to derive the functional dependence of the total pressure drop $\\Delta p$ across the tube bank. We begin by applying the integral form of the momentum equation to a fixed control volume that envelops the entire tube bank. Let the flow direction be the $x$-axis. The frontal area, normal to the flow, is denoted $A_f$. The momentum equation for steady, incompressible flow is:\n$$ \\sum F_x = \\iint_{CS} u_x (\\rho \\vec{u} \\cdot d\\vec{A}) $$\nwhere $\\sum F_x$ is the sum of all external forces acting on the fluid within the control volume, and the right-hand side represents the net rate of momentum leaving the control surface (CS).\n\nThe forces acting on the fluid are the pressure forces at the inlet (plane $1$) and outlet (plane $2$), and the drag force $F_D$ exerted by the tubes on the fluid. The pressure force at the inlet is $p_1 A_f$ and at the outlet is $-p_2 A_f$. The drag force acts in the $-x$ direction, so its component is $-F_D$. Thus, $\\sum F_x = p_1 A_f - p_2 A_f - F_D = \\Delta p A_f - F_D$, where $\\Delta p = p_1 - p_2$.\n\nThe momentum flux term is $\\dot{m}(u_{out} - u_{in})$. For an incompressible fluid with a constant cross-sectional area for the approach and departure flow, the average velocity at the inlet and outlet is the same as the frontal velocity, $u_{in} = u_{out} = u_f$. Therefore, the net change in momentum flux is zero. The momentum balance simplifies to:\n$$ \\Delta p A_f - F_D = 0 \\implies \\Delta p = \\frac{F_D}{A_f} $$\nThe total pressure drop across the bank is the sum of the pressure drops across each of the $N_r$ rows of tubes. The problem specifies that entrance and exit effects can be neglected, which is appropriate for a bank with a sufficient number of rows ($N_r = 12$, which satisfies the given condition $N_r \\ge 8$). This implies that the flow is fully developed or periodic within the bank, and thus the pressure drop per row, $\\Delta p_{\\text{row}}$, can be considered constant for all rows.\n$$ \\Delta p = \\sum_{i=1}^{N_r} \\Delta p_{\\text{row}, i} = N_r \\Delta p_{\\text{row}} $$\nThe problem defines a \"per-row dimensionless pressure-drop coefficient based on frontal velocity, called the Euler number ($\\text{Eu}$)\". Adhering to the standard convention in fluid mechanics, a pressure coefficient or Euler number normalizes a pressure difference by a characteristic dynamic pressure. The dynamic pressure based on the frontal velocity is $\\frac{1}{2}\\rho u_f^2$. We therefore define the per-row Euler number as:\n$$ \\text{Eu}_{\\text{row}} \\equiv \\frac{\\Delta p_{\\text{row}}}{\\frac{1}{2} \\rho u_f^2} $$\nFrom this definition, the pressure drop per row can be expressed as:\n$$ \\Delta p_{\\text{row}} = \\text{Eu}_{\\text{row}} \\left( \\frac{1}{2} \\rho u_f^2 \\right) $$\nSubstituting this expression into the equation for the total pressure drop yields the desired functional dependence:\n$$ \\Delta p = N_r \\cdot \\text{Eu}_{\\text{row}} \\left( \\frac{1}{2} \\rho u_f^2 \\right) $$\nThis expression relates the total pressure drop $\\Delta p$ to the number of rows $N_r$, the fluid density $\\rho$, the frontal velocity $u_f$, and the per-row Euler number $\\text{Eu}_{\\text{row}}$.\n\nThe second task is to compute the ratio $R = \\frac{\\Delta p_{\\text{stg}}}{\\Delta p_{\\text{inl}}}$.
