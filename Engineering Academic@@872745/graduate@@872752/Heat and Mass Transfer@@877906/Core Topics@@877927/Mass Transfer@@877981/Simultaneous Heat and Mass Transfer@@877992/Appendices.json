It describes a canonical problem in mass transfer theory, specifically the evaporation of a species $A$ into a stagnant species $B$. All necessary conditions and parameters for a unique and meaningful solution are provided. The problem is valid.\n\nThe derivation proceeds from the fundamental principles of mass transfer as required.\n\nThe total molar flux of species $A$, denoted $N_A$, in a binary mixture is the sum of its diffusive flux, $J_A$, and its convective flux. The convective flux is the transport of species $A$ due to the bulk motion of the mixture, given by its mole fraction $y_A$ times the total molar flux $(N_A + N_B)$. The relationship is expressed as:\n$$\nN_A = J_A + y_A (N_A + N_B)\n$$\nThe problem considers one-dimensional transport in the $z$-direction. For a binary system, the diffusive flux $J_A$ is described by Fick's first law of diffusion:\n$$\nJ_A = -c D_{AB} \\frac{dy_A}{dz}\n$$\nwhere $c$ is the total molar concentration of the mixture, $D_{AB}$ is the binary diffusion coefficient, and $\\frac{dy_A}{dz}$ is the gradient of the mole fraction of species $A$.\n\nSubstituting the expression for $J_A$ into the total flux equation yields:\n$$\nN_A = -c D_{AB} \\frac{dy_A}{dz} + y_A (N_A + N_B)\n$$\nA critical condition given in the problem is that the bulk gas is stagnant, which is specified to mean that species $B$ (dry air) has zero net molar flux. Therefore:\n$$\nN_B = 0\n$$\nApplying this condition to the flux equation for species $A$ simplifies it to:\n$$\nN_A = -c D_{AB} \\frac{dy_A}{dz} + y_A N_A\n$$\nThis equation must be solved for $N_A$. The term $y_A N_A$ accounts for the convective transport of species $A$ by the bulk flow, which is itself generated by the evaporation of species $A$. This induced bulk flow is known as the Stefan flow.\n\nTo solve for $N_A$, we rearrange the equation to separate the variables $y_A$ and $z$.\n$$\nN_A - y_A N_A = -c D_{AB} \\frac{dy_A}{dz}\n$$\n$$\nN_A (1 - y_A) = -c D_{AB} \\frac{dy_A}{dz}\n$$\nSince we are at steady state, the molar flux $N_A$ is constant along the diffusion path $z$. The problem also states that the total pressure $P$, temperature $T$, and binary diffusivity $D_{AB}$ are uniform throughout the gas film. For an ideal gas mixture, the total molar concentration $c$ is given by the ideal gas law:\n$$\nc = \\frac{P}{RT}\n$$\nwhere $R$ is the universal gas constant.

Subsequently, we are to quantify the sensitivity of this relationship to the Lewis number, $\\mathrm{Le}$.\n\nWe begin with the statement of the Chilton–Colburn $j$-factor analogy, which equates the $j$-factor for heat transfer, $j_{H}$, to the $j$-factor for mass transfer, $j_{M}$.\n$$j_{H} = j_{M}$$\nThe problem provides the definitions for these factors in terms of the respective Stanton numbers, the Prandtl number ($\\mathrm{Pr}$), and the Schmidt number ($\\mathrm{Sc}$).\n$$j_{H} \\equiv St_{H}\\,\\mathrm{Pr}^{2/3}$$\n$$j_{M} \\equiv St_{M}\\,\\mathrm{Sc}^{2/3}$$\nSubstituting these definitions into the analogy gives:\n$$St_{H}\\,\\mathrm{Pr}^{2/3} = St_{M}\\,\\mathrm{Sc}^{2/3}$$\nNext, we substitute the definitions of the heat Stanton number, $St_{H} \\equiv h_{g}/(\\rho_{g}\\,u\\,c_{p,g})$, and the mass Stanton number, $St_{M} \\equiv k_{g}/u$.\n$$\\left(\\frac{h_{g}}{\\rho_{g}\\,u\\,c_{p,g}}\\right)\\mathrm{Pr}^{2/3} = \\left(\\frac{k_{g}}{u}\\right)\\mathrm{Sc}^{2/3}$$\nWe can solve this equation for $h_{g}$. The characteristic velocity, $u$, is present on both sides of the equation and thus cancels out, which is expected as the transfer coefficients should depend on the flow conditions, but the relationship between them should not depend on the specific velocity, but rather on the fluid properties.\n$$h_{g} = \\rho_{g}\\,c_{p,g}\\,k_{g}\\,\\left(\\frac{\\mathrm{Sc}}{\\mathrm{Pr}}\\right)^{2/3}$$\nThis expression relates the heat and mass transfer coefficients.

This implies $r^2 N_{Ar} = \\mathrm{constant}$.\nThe molar flux $N_{Ar}$ is given by Fick's law including bulk flow (Stefan flow):\n$$\nN_{Ar} = -c D_{AB} \\frac{dy_A}{dr} + y_A (N_{Ar} + N_{Br})\n$$\nwhere $c$ is the total molar concentration of the gas mixture, and $y_A$ is the mole fraction of $A$. Since air is stagnant and does not dissolve in the solid, its flux $N_{Br}$ is zero everywhere. The equation simplifies to:\n$$\nN_{Ar} = -\\frac{c D_{AB}}{1-y_A} \\frac{dy_A}{dr}\n$$\nThe boundary conditions are:\n- At the sphere surface, $r=R_s$: the vapor is saturated, so its mole fraction is $y_A(R_s) = y_{As} = p_{\\mathrm{sat}}(T_s)/p$.\n- In the far field, $r \\to \\infty$: the air is dry, so $y_A(\\infty) = y_{A\\infty} = 0$.\n\nFor quasi-steady, spherically symmetric heat transport by conduction only, the energy conservation equation is:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{r^2} \\frac{d}{dr}(r^2 q_r'') = 0\n$$\nwhere $q_r''$ is the radial heat flux. This implies $r^2 q_r'' = \\mathrm{constant}$. The heat flux is given by Fourier's law:\n$$\nq_r'' = -k_g \\frac{dT}{dr}\n$$\nThe boundary conditions are:\n- At the sphere surface, $r=R_s$: the temperature is $T(R_s) = T_s$.\n- In the far field, $r \\to \\infty$: the temperature is $T(\\infty) = T_{\\infty}$.\n\nPart 2: Elimination of Gas-Phase Fields and Coupled Relations\n\nFirst, we solve the mass transport problem. Integrating the conservation equation gives $r^2 N_{Ar} = R_s^2 N_{As}''$, where $N_{As}''$ is the molar flux at the surface. Substituting the Fick's law expression:\n$$\n\\frac{R_s^2 N_{As}''}{r^2} = -\\frac{c D_{AB}}{1-y_A} \\frac{dy_A}{dr}\n$$\nSeparating variables and integrating from $r=R_s$ to $r\\to\\infty$:\n$$\nR_s^2 N_{As}'' \\int_{R_s}^{\\infty} \\frac{dr}{r^2} = -c D_{AB} \\int_{y_{As}}^{y_{A\\infty}=0} \\frac{dy_A}{1-y_A}\n$$\n$$\nR_s N_{As}'' = c D_{AB} [\\ln(1-y_A)]_{y_{As}}^{0} = -c D_{AB} \\ln(1-y_{As})\n$$\nThe molar flux at the surface is thus related to the surface mole fraction:\n$$\nN_{As}'' = \\frac{c D_{AB}}{R_s} \\ln\\left(\\frac{1}{1-y_{As}}\\right)\n$$\n\nNext, we solve the heat transport problem. Integrating the energy equation gives $r^2 q_r'' = R_s^2 q_s''$, where $q_s''$ is the heat flux leaving the surface into the gas. Using Fourier's law:\n$$\n\\frac{R_s^2 q_s''}{r^2} = -k_g \\frac{dT}{dr}\n$$\nSeparating variables and integrating from $r=R_s$ to $r\\to\\infty$:\n$$\nR_s^2 q_s'' \\int_{R_s}^{\\infty} \\frac{dr}{r^2} = -k_g \\int_{T_s}^{T_{\\infty}} dT\n$$\n$$\nR_s q_s'' = -k_g(T_{\\infty}-T_s) = k_g(T_s - T_{\\infty})\n$$\nSo the heat flux from the surface into the gas is $q_s'' = \\frac{k_g}{R_s}(T_s - T_{\\infty})$.\nAt the interface, the energy required for sublimation is supplied by heat conduction from the gas. The energy balance is $N_{As}'' \\Delta H_{\\mathrm{sub}} = -q_s''$. Thus:\n$$\nN_{As}'' \\Delta H_{\\mathrm{sub}} = \\frac{k_g}{R_s} (T_{\\infty} - T_s)\n$$\n\nEquating the two expressions derived for $N_{As}''$ yields a single implicit equation for the unknown surface temperature $T_s$:\n$$\n\\left[ \\frac{c D_{AB}}{R_s} \\ln\\left(\\frac{1}{1-y_{As}}\\right) \\right] \\Delta H_{\\mathrm{sub}} = \\frac{k_g}{R_s} (T_{\\infty} - T_s)\n$$\nSimplifying and substituting $y_{As} = p_{\\mathrm{sat}}(T_s)/p$:\n$$\nc D_{AB} \\Delta H_{\\mathrm{sub}} \\ln\\left(\\frac{p}{p - p_{\\mathrm{sat}}(T_s)}\\right) = k_g (T_{\\infty} - T_s)\n$$\nThis is the coupled relation between the transport properties and the surface conditions.\n\nPart 3: Determination of the Mass Flux\n\nTo solve for the mass flux, we must first find $T_s$ by solving the transcendental equation derived above. The total molar concentration $c$ is evaluated at $T_{\\infty}$ using the ideal gas law:\n$$\nc = \\frac{p}{R_u T_{\\infty}} = \\frac{1.01325 \\times 10^{5} \\ \\mathrm{Pa}}{(8.314 \\ \\mathrm{J} \\ \\mathrm{mol}^{-1} \\ \\mathrm{K}^{-1})(298 \\ \\mathrm{K})} \\approx 40.897 \\ \\mathrm{mol} \\ \\mathrm{m}^{-3}\n$$\nThe transcendental equation for $T_s$ is:\n$$\n(T_{\\infty} - T_s) = \\frac{c D_{AB} \\Delta H_{\\mathrm{sub}}}{k_g} \\ln\\left(\\frac{p}{p - p_{\\mathrm{sat}}(T_s)}\\right)\n$$\nSubstituting the numerical values:\n$$\n\\frac{c D_{AB} \\Delta H_{\\mathrm{sub}}}{k_g} = \\frac{(40.897 \\ \\mathrm{mol} \\ \\mathrm{m}^{-3})(7.5 \\times 10^{-6} \\ \\mathrm{m}^2 \\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1})(7.30 \\times 10^{4} \\ \\mathrm{J} \\ \\mathrm{mol}^{-1})}{2.6 \\times 10^{-2} \\ \\mathrm{W} \\ \\mathrm{m}^{-1} \\ \\mathrm{K}^{-1}} \\approx 861.23 \\ \\mathrm{K}\n$$\nThe saturation pressure is given by:\n$$\np_{\\mathrm{sat}}(T_s) = (11.6 \\ \\mathrm{Pa}) \\exp\\!\\left[-\\frac{7.30 \\times 10^{4} \\ \\mathrm{J} \\ \\mathrm{mol}^{-1}}{8.314 \\ \\mathrm{J} \\ \\mathrm{mol}^{-1} \\ \\mathrm{K}^{-1}} \\left(\\frac{1}{T_s} - \\frac{1}{298 \\ \\mathrm{K}}\\right)\\right]\n$$\nThe equation to solve is:\n$$\n(298 - T_s) = 861.23 \\ln\\left(\\frac{1.01325 \\times 10^5}{1.01325 \\times 10^5 - p_{\\mathrm{sat}}(T_s)}\\right)\n$$\nThis equation is solved numerically by iteration. The solution converges to a surface temperature $T_s \\approx 297.902 \\ \\mathrm{K}$, corresponding to a temperature drop of $T_{\\infty} - T_s \\approx 0.098 \\ \\mathrm{K}$. A more precise solution yields $T_{\\infty} - T_s \\approx 0.09766 \\ \\mathrm{K}$.\n\nWe can now calculate the molar flux $N_{As}''$ using the heat transfer relation, as it is algebraically simpler:\n$$\nN_{As}'' = \\frac{k_g (T_{\\infty} - T_s)}{R_s \\Delta H_{\\mathrm{sub}}} = \\frac{(2.6 \\times 10^{-2} \\ \\mathrm{W} \\ \\mathrm{m}^{-1} \\ \\mathrm{K}^{-1})(0.09766 \\ \\mathrm{K})}{(5.0 \\times 10^{-3} \\ \\mathrm{m})(7.30 \\times 10^{4} \\ \\mathrm{J} \\ \\mathrm{mol}^{-1})}\n$$\n$$\nN_{As}'' \\approx 6.9566 \\times 10^{-6} \\ \\mathrm{mol} \\ \\mathrm{m}^{-2} \\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1}\n$$\nFinally, the mass flux $m''$ is the molar flux multiplied by the molar mass of naphthalene, $M_A$:\n$$\nm'' = N_{As}'' M_A = (6.9566 \\times 10^{-6} \\ \\mathrm{mol} \\ \\mathrm{m}^{-2} \\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1})(1.2817 \\times 10^{-1} \\ \\mathrm{kg} \\ \\mathrm{mol}^{-1})\n$$\n$$\nm'' \\approx 8.916 \\times 10^{-7} \\ \\mathrm{kg} \\ \\mathrm{m}^{-2} \\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1}\n$$\nRounding to three significant figures as requested gives the final answer.\n$$\nm'' \\approx 8.92 \\times 10^{-7} \\ \\mathrm{kg} \\ \\mathrm{m}^{-2} \\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1}\n$$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{8.92 \\times 10^{-7}}$$", "id": "2521790"}]}
