The boundary conditions (prescribed temperature and insulated walls) are physically realistic. The problem is fundamentally sound.\n- **Well-Posedness**: The problem is a standard, well-posed boundary value problem for an elliptic partial differential equation. The given boundary conditions are sufficient to guarantee the existence of a unique, stable solution.\n- **Objectivity**: The problem is stated in precise mathematical language, free of ambiguity or subjective claims. The symmetry of the top boundary condition $T(x,b)$ about $x=a$ is correctly identified and consistent with the geometry and other boundary conditions, justifying the proposed reduction of the domain.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid as it is scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and internally consistent. A solution will be derived.\n\nThe governing equation for steady-state two-dimensional heat conduction without heat generation is the Laplace equation:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial^2 T}{\\partial x^2} + \\frac{\\partial^2 T}{\\partial y^2} = 0 $$\nThe problem possesses symmetry about the line $x=a$. We verify this by observing that the domain is symmetric, and the boundary conditions are also symmetric. The temperature profile at $y=b$ is explicitly symmetric, $T(a-z, b) = T(a+z, b)$ for $z \\in [0,a]$. The condition $T(x,0)=0$ is also symmetric. The insulation conditions at $x=0$ and $x=2a$ are consistent with a symmetric temperature field. This symmetry implies that the heat flux across the line of symmetry must be zero, i.e., $\\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial x}|_{x=a} = 0$.\n\nWe can therefore simplify the problem by considering only the half-domain $0 \\le x \\le a$, $0 \\le y \\le b$. The boundary conditions for this reduced problem are:\n1.  Bottom edge ($y=0$): $T(x,0)=0$. This is a homogeneous Dirichlet condition.\n2.  Left edge ($x=0$): $\\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial x}(0,y)=0$. This is a homogeneous Neumann condition.\n3.  Right edge ($x=a$): $\\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial x}(a,y)=0$. This is a homogeneous Neumann condition from symmetry.\n4.  Top edge ($y=b$): $T(x,b) = T_0\\left(1 - \\frac{|x-a|}{a}\\right)$. For $x \\in [0,a]$, $|x-a| = a-x$. Thus, $T(x,b) = T_0\\left(1 - \\frac{a-x}{a}\\right) = T_0\\frac{x}{a}$. This is the non-homogeneous boundary condition.\n\nWe apply the method of separation of variables, assuming a solution of the form $T(x,y) = X(x)Y(y)$. Substituting into the Laplace equation gives:\n$$ X''(x)Y(y) + X(x)Y''(y) = 0 $$\n$$ \\frac{X''(x)}{X(x)} = -\\frac{Y''(y)}{Y(y)} = -\\lambda^2 $$\nWe choose the separation constant to be $-\\lambda^2$ because the homogeneous Neumann conditions in the $x$-direction suggest an oscillatory solution.\n\nThe problem for $X(x)$ is a Sturm-Liouville problem:\n$$ X''(x) + \\lambda^2 X(x) = 0, \\quad X'(0)=0, \\quad X'(a)=0 $$\nThe general solution is $X(x) = A\\cos(\\lambda x) + B\\sin(\\lambda x)$.\nApplying $X'(0)=0$ gives $-A\\lambda\\sin(0) + B\\lambda\\cos(0) = B\\lambda = 0$.\nIf $\\lambda=0$, the equation is $X''=0$, so $X(x)=C_1 x + C_2$. $X'(x)=C_1$. $X'(0)=0 \\implies C_1=0$. $X'(a)=0 \\implies C_1=0$. Thus, $X_0(x)=\\text{constant}$ is a valid solution for $\\lambda_0=0$.\nIf $\\lambda \\ne 0$, then $B=0$, so $X(x)=A\\cos(\\lambda x)$.\nApplying $X'(a)=0$ gives $-A\\lambda\\sin(\\lambda a) = 0$.

The condition $Y_0(0)=0$ gives $D=0$, so $Y_0(y)=Cy$.\nFor $\\lambda_n = \\frac{n\\pi}{a}$ ($n \\ge 1$): The general solution is $Y_n(y) = E_n \\cosh(\\frac{n\\pi y}{a}) + F_n \\sinh(\\frac{n\\pi y}{a})$. The condition $Y_n(0)=0$ gives $E_n \\cosh(0) + F_n \\sinh(0) = E_n = 0$. Thus, $Y_n(y) = F_n \\sinh(\\frac{n\\pi y}{a})$.\n\nThe general solution for the temperature $T(x,y)$ is a superposition of these product solutions:\n$$ T(x,y) = C_0 y + \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} C_n \\cos\\left(\\frac{n\\pi x}{a}\\right)\\sinh\\left(\\frac{n\\pi y}{a}\\right) $$\nThe coefficients $C_n$ are determined by the remaining non-homogeneous boundary condition at $y=b$:\n$$ T(x,b) = T_0 \\frac{x}{a} = C_0 b + \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} C_n \\sinh\\left(\\frac{n\\pi b}{a}\\right) \\cos\\left(\\frac{n\\pi x}{a}\\right) $$\nThis is a Fourier cosine series representation of the function $f(x)=T_0 \\frac{x}{a}$ on the interval $[0, a]$. The coefficients of the series are found by exploiting the orthogonality of the cosine functions.\n\nThe problem asks specifically for the coefficient that multiplies the mode $\\cos(\\frac{\\pi x}{a})\\sinh(\\frac{\\pi y}{a})$. This corresponds to the $n=1$ term in our series. The coefficient is $C_1$.\nThe coefficient of the $\\cos(\\frac{n\\pi x}{a})$ term in the Fourier series is given by $C_n \\sinh(\\frac{n\\pi b}{a})$.

The conservation of energy for a differential control volume under steady-state conditions ($\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t} = 0$) with no internal heat generation ($\\dot{q} = 0$) is expressed as the divergence of the heat flux vector being zero:\n$$ \\nabla \\cdot \\vec{q} = 0 $$\nFourier's law of heat conduction relates the heat flux vector $\\vec{q}$ to the temperature gradient $\\nabla T$:\n$$ \\vec{q} = -k \\nabla T $$\nwhere $k$ is the thermal conductivity. Substituting Fourier's law into the energy balance gives:\n$$ \\nabla \\cdot (-k \\nabla T) = 0 $$\nFor a homogeneous and isotropic material, $k$ is a constant scalar, which can be factored out:\n$$ -k \\nabla \\cdot (\\nabla T) = -k \\nabla^2 T = 0 $$\nSince $k$ is non-zero, this simplifies to the Laplace equation:\n$$ \\nabla^2 T = 0 $$\nIn a two-dimensional Cartesian coordinate system, this equation is:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial^2 T}{\\partial x^2} + \\frac{\\partial^2 T}{\\partial y^2} = 0 $$\nThis justifies the governing PDE.\n\nNext, we verify that the proposed solution $T(x,y)$ satisfies this equation. The solution is a linear superposition of two terms:\n$T(x,y) = T_1(x,y) + T_2(x,y)$, where\n$$ T_1(x,y) = C_1 \\sin(\\lambda_1 x) \\cosh(\\lambda_1(H-y)) \\quad \\text{with } \\lambda_1 = \\frac{\\pi}{L}, C_1 = \\frac{T_0}{\\cosh(\\lambda_1 H)} $$\n$$ T_2(x,y) = C_2 \\sin(\\lambda_2 x) \\cosh(\\lambda_2(H-y)) \\quad \\text{with } \\lambda_2 = \\frac{3\\pi}{L}, C_2 = \\frac{T_0}{2\\cosh(\\lambda_2 H)} $$\nDue to the linearity of the Laplace operator $\\nabla^2$, we can verify each term separately.

There are no contradictions.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and an unambiguously stated mathematical task. It contains no invalidating flaws. Therefore, the problem is deemed **valid**. A solution will now be constructed.\n\nThe task is to solve a linear partial differential equation (PDE) with inhomogeneous boundary conditions. The principle of superposition is central. We decompose the solution $T(x,y)$ into two parts: $T(x,y) = v(x,y) + w(x,y)$. Here, $w(x,y)$ is the \"boundary lifting\" function, constructed to satisfy the inhomogeneous boundary conditions. The residual, $v(x,y)$, will then satisfy a related PDE but with homogeneous boundary conditions, which is amenable to standard solution techniques such as separation of variables.\n\n**Construction of the Lifting Function $w(x,y)$**\nWe require a function $w(x,y)$ that satisfies $w(x,0)=f(x)$, $w(x,H)=g(x)$, $w(0,y)=h(y)$, and $w(L,y)=p(y)$. A systematic way to construct such a function is to add together linear interpolants for opposite pairs of boundaries and then subtract the over-counted contributions at the corners.\n\nLet us first define a function that interpolates linearly between the boundary functions on the edges $y=0$ and $y=H$:\n$$U_y(x,y) = \\left(1 - \\frac{y}{H}\\right)f(x) + \\frac{y}{H}g(x)$$\nAnd another that interpolates linearly between the edges $x=0$ and $x=L$:\n$$U_x(x,y) = \\left(1 - \\frac{x}{L}\\right)h(y) + \\frac{x}{L}p(y)$$\nIf we simply sum these, $U_x+U_y$, we double-count the boundaries. For instance, at $y=0$:\n$$(U_y+U_x)(x,0) = f(x) + \\left(1 - \\frac{x}{L}\\right)h(0) + \\frac{x}{L}p(0)$$\nUsing the compatibility conditions $h(0)=f(0)$ and $p(0)=f(L)$, this becomes $f(x) + (1 - \\frac{x}{L})f(0) + \\frac{x}{L}f(L)$. This is not $f(x)$. The term added to $f(x)$ is a linear interpolation of the corner values $f(0)$ and $f(L)$. This suggests that the over-counted terms correspond to a bilinear interpolation of the four corner values.\n\nLet us define the bilinear interpolant of the four corner values $f(0)$, $f(L)$, $g(0)$, and $g(L)$:\n$$w_c(x,y) = \\left(1-\\frac{x}{L}\\right)\\left(1-\\frac{y}{H}\\right)f(0) + \\frac{x}{L}\\left(1-\\frac{y}{H}\\right)f(L) + \\left(1-\\frac{x}{L}\\right)\\frac{y}{H}g(0) + \\frac{x}{L}\\frac{y}{H}g(L)$$\nThis function $w_c(x,y)$ correctly evaluates to the specified values at the four corners.\nNow, we construct the required lifting function $w(x,y)$ as:\n$$w(x,y) = U_y(x,y) + U_x(x,y) - w_c(x,y)$$\nLet us verify that this function $w(x,y)$ satisfies all four boundary conditions.\nAt $y=0$:\n$$w(x,0) = U_y(x,0) + U_x(x,0) - w_c(x,0)$$\n$$w(x,0) = f(x) + \\left[\\left(1-\\frac{x}{L}\\right)h(0) + \\frac{x}{L}p(0)\\right] - \\left[\\left(1-\\frac{x}{L}\\right)f(0) + \\frac{x}{L}f(L)\\right]$$\nUsing compatibility $h(0)=f(0)$ and $p(0)=f(L)$, the second and third terms cancel, leaving $w(x,0) = f(x)$.\nThe verification is analogous for the other three boundaries due to the symmetrical construction and use of all compatibility conditions. For example, at $x=0$:\n$$w(0,y) = U_y(0,y) + U_x(0,y) - w_c(0,y)$$\n$$w(0,y) = \\left[\\left(1-\\frac{y}{H}\\right)f(0) + \\frac{y}{H}g(0)\\right] + h(y) - \\left[\\left(1-\\frac{y}{H}\\right)f(0) + \\frac{y}{H}g(0)\\right] = h(y)$$\nThus, the constructed $w(x,y)$ is a valid boundary lifting function. Its explicit expression is:\n$$w(x,y) = \\left(1-\\frac{y}{H}\\right)f(x) + \\frac{y}{H}g(x) + \\left(1-\\frac{x}{L}\\right)h(y) + \\frac{x}{L}p(y) - \\left[\\left(1-\\frac{x}{L}\\right)\\left(1-\\frac{y}{H}\\right)f(0) + \\frac{x}{L}\\left(1-\\frac{y}{H}\\right)f(L) + \\left(1-\\frac{x}{L}\\right)\\frac{y}{H}g(0) + \\frac{x}{L}\\frac{y}{H}g(L)\\right]$$\n\n**The Problem for the Residual Function $v(x,y)$**\nWe define $v(x,y) = T(x,y) - w(x,y)$.\nThe governing equation for $T(x,y)$ is $\\nabla^2 T = 0$. Since the Laplacian $\\nabla^2 = \\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial x^2} + \\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial y^2}$ is a linear operator, we have:\n$$\\nabla^2 T = \\nabla^2(v + w) = \\nabla^2 v + \\nabla^2 w = 0$$\nThis implies that the PDE for $v(x,y)$ is a Poisson equation:\n$$\\nabla^2 v = - \\nabla^2 w$$\nWe compute $\\nabla^2 w$. Differentiating $w(x,y)$ twice with respect to $x$ yields:\n$$\\frac{\\partial^2 w}{\\partial x^2} = \\left(1-\\frac{y}{H}\\right)f''(x) + \\frac{y}{H}g''(x)$$\nNote that all other terms in $w(x,y)$ are at most linear in $x$, so their second partial derivative with respect to $x$ is zero. Similarly, for $y$:\n$$\\frac{\\partial^2 w}{\\partial y^2} = \\left(1-\\frac{x}{L}\\right)h''(y) + \\frac{x}{L}p''(y)$$\nThe source term $\\nabla^2 w$ is therefore:\n$$\\nabla^2 w = \\left(1-\\frac{y}{H}\\right)f''(x) + \\frac{y}{H}g''(x) + \\left(1-\\frac{x}{L}\\right)h''(y) + \\frac{x}{L}p''(y)$$\nThe governing equation for $v(x,y)$ is:\n$$\\frac{\\partial^{2} v}{\\partial x^{2}}+\\frac{\\partial^{2} v}{\\partial y^{2}} = -\\left[\\left(1-\\frac{y}{H}\\right)f''(x) + \\frac{y}{H}g''(x) + \\left(1-\\frac{x}{L}\\right)h''(y) + \\frac{x}{L}p''(y)\\right]$$\nThe boundary conditions for $v(x,y)$ are found by evaluating $v = T-w$ on the boundary. Since $w$ was constructed to match $T$ on all boundaries, we have:\n-   $v(x,0) = T(x,0)-w(x,0) = f(x)-f(x) = 0$\n-   $v(x,H) = T(x,H)-w(x,H) = g(x)-g(x) = 0$\n-   $v(0,y) = T(0,y)-w(0,y) = h(y)-h(y) = 0$\n-   $v(L,y) = T(L,y)-w(L,y) = p(y)-p(y) = 0$\nThe residual function $v(x,y)$ satisfies a Poisson equation with homogeneous (zero) Dirichlet boundary conditions.\n\n**Applicability of Separation of Variables**\nThe method of separation of variables is directly applicable to the *homogeneous* version of the residual problem, i.e., Laplace's equation $\\nabla^2 v = 0$ with homogeneous Dirichlet conditions on the rectangle. This method yields a complete set of orthogonal eigenfunctions of the form $\\sin\\left(\\frac{n\\pi x}{L}\\right)\\sin\\left(\\frac{m\\pi y}{H}\\right)$ for integers $n,m \\ge 1$.\nFor the *inhomogeneous* problem (Poisson's equation) that $v(x,y)$ satisfies, the solution strategy is to use these same eigenfunctions as a basis for a double Fourier sine series expansion. Both the solution $v(x,y)$ and the known source term $F(x,y) = -\\nabla^2 w$ are expanded in this basis. Substituting these series into the Poisson equation transforms the PDE into an algebraic equation for the series coefficients of $v(x,y)$. This successful approach, known as the method of eigenfunction expansion, is a generalization of separation of variables. The critical enabling feature is the transformation of the original problem with inhomogeneous boundary conditions into one with homogeneous boundary conditions, for which a set of basis functions can be readily found. Therefore, separation of variables is indeed the foundational technique for solving the residual problem.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\nw(x,y) = \\left(1-\\frac{y}{H}\\right)f(x) + \\frac{y}{H}g(x) + \\left(1-\\frac{x}{L}\\right)h(y) + \\frac{x}{L}p(y) - \\left(1-\\frac{x}{L}\\right)\\left(1-\\frac{y}{H}\\right)f(0) - \\frac{x}{L}\\left(1-\\frac{y}{H}\\right)f(L) - \\left(1-\\frac{x}{L}\\right)\\frac{y}{H}g(0) - \\frac{x}{L}\\frac{y}{H}g(L)\n}$$", "id": "2536535"}]}
