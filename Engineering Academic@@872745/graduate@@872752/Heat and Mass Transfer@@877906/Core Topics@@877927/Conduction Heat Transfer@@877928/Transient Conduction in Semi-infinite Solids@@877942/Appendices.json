It is therefore deemed valid. We shall proceed with the derivation as requested, following the specified steps.\n\nFirst, we derive the governing partial differential equation from the local conservation of energy and Fourier's law of conduction. Consider a one-dimensional control volume of infinitesimal thickness $dx$ and cross-sectional area $A$. The conservation of energy states that the rate of energy accumulation within the volume is equal to the net rate of heat conducted into it.\nThe rate of heat conduction into the control volume at position $x$ is $q(x,t) = A q_x''(x,t)$, and the rate of heat conduction out of the control volume at position $x+dx$ is $q(x+dx, t) = A q_x''(x+dx, t)$. The rate of change of internal energy stored within the volume is $\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t}(\\rho A \\,dx\\, c T)$, where $\\rho$ is the density, $c$ is the specific heat, and $T$ is the temperature.\nThe energy balance is thus:\n$$A q_x''(x,t) - A q_x''(x+dx,t) = \\rho c A \\,dx \\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial t}$$\nDividing by $A \\,dx$ and taking the limit as $dx \\to 0$:\n$$-\\frac{\\partial q_x''}{\\partial x} = \\rho c \\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial t}$$\nAccording to Fourier's law of heat conduction, the heat flux $q_x''$ is proportional to the negative temperature gradient: $q_x'' = -k \\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial x}$, where $k$ is the thermal conductivity. Substituting this into the energy balance gives:\n$$-\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}\\left(-k \\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial x}\\right) = \\rho c \\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial t}$$\nFor constant thermal conductivity $k$, this simplifies to the one-dimensional heat equation:\n$$k \\frac{\\partial^2 T}{\\partial x^2} = \\rho c \\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial t}$$\n$$ \\implies \\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial t} = \\alpha \\frac{\\partial^2 T}{\\partial x^2} $$\nwhere $\\alpha = k/(\\rho c)$ is the thermal diffusivity.\n\nThe initial and boundary conditions are specified by the problem statement:\n1.

Express your result symbolically; do not substitute numerical values. No rounding is required. If you introduce any intermediate parameter, eliminate it in your final expression so that the final answer depends only on $x$, $t$, $\\alpha$, $\\Delta T$, $\\omega$, and $T_i$.\n\nNote: You may assume that the Heaviside step function $H(t)$ is used implicitly to enforce causality of the applied surface temperature. The analysis must begin from the governing partial differential equation and boundary/initial conditions and build the argument to the transform-domain evaluation in a logically consistent way.", "solution": "The problem as stated is subjected to validation.\n\nGivens are extracted verbatim:\n- A homogeneous, isotropic, semi-infinite solid occupies the half-space $x \\ge 0$.\n- Thermal properties are constant, thermal diffusivity is $\\alpha$.\n- For $t < 0$, the temperature is uniform at $T_i$.\n- At $t=0^{+}$, the surface at $x=0$ is subjected to a time-varying temperature history $T(0,t) = T_i + \\Delta T \\sin(\\omega t)$.\n- The boundary condition at infinity is $T(x,t)\\to T_i$ as $x\\to\\infty$ for each fixed $t>0$.\n- There is no internal heat generation.\n- Conduction is one-dimensional along $x$.\n\nValidation based on extracted givens:\n- **Scientific Grounding**: The problem is based on the well-established principles of Fourier's law of heat conduction and the conservation of energy, which combine to form the heat equation.

It is a canonical problem in transient heat conduction and is well-posed, scientifically grounded, and provides sufficient information for a unique solution. We proceed with the derivation.\n\nTo simplify the problem, we define an excess temperature $\\theta(x,t) = T(x,t) - T_i$. The governing partial differential equation (PDE) for one-dimensional heat conduction without internal generation is:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial t} = \\alpha \\frac{\\partial^2 T}{\\partial x^2}\n$$\nIn terms of $\\theta$, the problem becomes:\nPDE:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial \\theta}{\\partial t} = \\alpha \\frac{\\partial^2 \\theta}{\\partial x^2} \\quad \\text{for } x>0, t>0\n$$\nInitial Condition (IC):\n$$\n\\theta(x,0) = T(x,0) - T_i = 0 \\quad \\text{for } x>0\n$$\nBoundary Conditions (BCs):\n$$\n\\theta(0,t) = T(0,t) - T_i = \\Delta T \\sin(\\omega t) \\equiv f(t) \\quad \\text{for } t>0\n$$\n$$\n\\theta(x,t) \\to 0 \\quad \\text{as } x \\to \\infty\n$$\n\n**Part 1: Derivation of the Convolution Representation (Duhamel's Theorem)**\n\nBy the principle of linearity, the response $\\theta(x,t)$ to a general, causal surface temperature history $f(t)$ can be constructed by superposing the responses to infinitesimal step changes. First, we find the response to a unit step change in surface temperature, $\\theta(0,t) = 1$ for $t>0$. Let this response be denoted by $U(x,t)$. The solution for $U(x,t)$ is a standard result for the semi-infinite solid:\n$$\nU(x,t) = \\operatorname{erfc}\\left( \\frac{x}{2\\sqrt{\\alpha t}} \\right)\n$$\nwhere $\\operatorname{erfc}$ is the complementary error function. This is the semi-infinite step-response kernel requested.\n\nAn arbitrary time-varying boundary condition $f(t)$ can be represented as an initial step of magnitude $f(0)$ at $t=0$ followed by a continuous series of infinitesimal steps. The response to the initial step $f(0)$ is $f(0)U(x,t)$. An infinitesimal change $df$ occurring at time $\\tau$, given by $df(\\tau) = f'(\\tau)d\\tau$, produces a response $dU(x,t-\\tau) \\cdot f'(\\tau)d\\tau$ at a later time $t$. By superposition, the total response is the sum of the response to the initial step $f(0)$ and the integral of the responses to all subsequent infinitesimal changes:\n$$\n\\theta(x,t) = f(0)U(x,t) + \\int_{0}^{t} f'(\\tau) U(x, t-\\tau) d\\tau\n$$\nIntegrating the convolution integral by parts, where $u=U(x,t-\\tau)$ and $dv=f'(\\tau)d\\tau$:\n$$\n\\int_{0}^{t} f'(\\tau) U(x, t-\\tau) d\\tau = \\left[f(\\tau)U(x, t-\\tau)\\right]_{\\tau=0}^{\\tau=t} - \\int_{0}^{t} f(\\tau) \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\tau}U(x, t-\\tau) d\\tau\n$$\nThe boundary term evaluates to $f(t)U(x,0) - f(0)U(x,t)$. As $U(x,0)=\\operatorname{erfc}(\\infty)=0$, this simplifies to $-f(0)U(x,t)$. Substituting back:\n$$\n\\theta(x,t) = f(0)U(x,t) - f(0)U(x,t) - \\int_{0}^{t} f(\\tau) \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\tau}U(x, t-\\tau) d\\tau\n$$\nLetting $\\eta=t-\\tau$, we have $d\\eta = -d\\tau$ and $\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\tau} = -\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\eta}$. The integral becomes:\n$$\n\\theta(x,t) = \\int_{0}^{t} f(\\tau) \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial\\eta}U(x,\\eta)\\Big|_{\\eta=t-\\tau} d\\tau = \\int_{0}^{t} f(\\tau) \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial\nt}U(x, t-\\tau) d\\tau\n$$\nThe derivative of the step-response kernel is:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial U(x, t-\\tau)}{\\partial t} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t}\\operatorname{erfc}\\left(\\frac{x}{2\\sqrt{\\alpha(t-\\tau)}}\\right) = \\frac{x}{2\\sqrt{\\pi\\alpha}(t-\\tau)^{3/2}} \\exp\\left( -\\frac{x^2}{4\\alpha(t-\\tau)} \\right)\n$$\nThus, the convolution representation for $\\theta(x,t)$ is:\n$$\n\\theta(x,t) = \\int_{0}^{t} f(\\tau) \\frac{x}{2\\sqrt{\\pi\\alpha}(t-\\tau)^{3/2}} \\exp\\left( -\\frac{x^2}{4\\alpha(t-\\tau)} \\right) d\\tau\n$$\nThis completes the derivation of the convolution representation as required.\n\n**Part 2: Steady-Periodic Solution via Transform Domain**\n\nWe now specialize to the sinusoidal boundary condition $f(t) = \\Delta T \\sin(\\omega t)$ and seek the long-time (steady-periodic) solution. Evaluating the above integral directly is not practical. Instead, as instructed, we use a transform-domain argument. The solution $\\theta(x,t)$ is the convolution of the input $f(t)$ with the system's impulse response, $g(x,t) = \\frac{\\partial U}{\\partial t}$. In the Laplace domain, convolution becomes multiplication:\n$$\n\\hat{\\theta}(x,s) = \\hat{g}(x,s) \\hat{f}(s)\n$$\nwhere $\\hat{g}(x,s) = \\mathcal{L}\\{g(x,t)\\}$ is the transfer function. We can find $\\hat{g}(x,s)$ by taking the Laplace transform of the governing PDE:\n$$\ns\\hat{\\theta}(x,s) - \\theta(x,0) = \\alpha \\frac{d^2\\hat{\\theta}}{dx^2} \\implies \\frac{d^2\\hat{\\theta}}{dx^2} - \\frac{s}{\\alpha}\\hat{\\theta} = 0\n$$\nThe solution that satisfies $\\hat{\\theta} \\to 0$ as $x \\to \\infty$ is $\\hat{\\theta}(x,s) = C(s) \\exp(-x\\sqrt{s/\\alpha})$.\nApplying the boundary condition at $x=0$, $\\hat{\\theta}(0,s) = \\hat{f}(s)$, gives $C(s) = \\hat{f}(s)$. Therefore:\n$$\n\\hat{\\theta}(x,s) = \\hat{f}(s) \\exp\\left(-x\\sqrt{\\frac{s}{\\alpha}}\\right)\n$$\nThe transfer function is $\\hat{g}(x,s) = \\exp(-x\\sqrt{s/\\alpha})$.\nThe steady-periodic response to a sinusoidal input $f(t)$ is found by evaluating the system's response to the complex input $f_c(t) = \\Delta T \\exp(i\\omega t)$ and taking the imaginary part. The steady-state response to $f_c(t)$ is given by $\\theta_{c,ss}(t) = \\hat{g}(x, i\\omega) f_c(t)$.\n$$\n\\theta_{c,ss}(x,t) = \\exp\\left(-x\\sqrt{\\frac{i\\omega}{\\alpha}}\\right) \\cdot \\Delta T \\exp(i\\omega t)\n$$\nTo simplify the term $\\sqrt{i}$, we use its polar representation: $i = \\exp(i\\pi/2)$.\n$$\n\\sqrt{i} = \\exp(i\\pi/4) = \\cos(\\pi/4) + i\\sin(\\pi/4) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} + i\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} = \\frac{1+i}{\\sqrt{2}}\n$$\nSubstituting this into the exponent:\n$$\n\\sqrt{\\frac{i\\omega}{\\alpha}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\omega}{\\alpha}} \\sqrt{i} = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\omega}{\\alpha}} \\left(\\frac{1+i}{\\sqrt{2}}\\right) = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\omega}{2\\alpha}}(1+i)\n$$\nLet us define the parameter $k = \\sqrt{\\omega/(2\\alpha)}$. The exponent becomes $-xk(1+i) = -kx - ikx$.\nThe complex steady-state solution is then:\n$$\n\\theta_{c,ss}(x,t) = \\Delta T \\exp(-kx - ikx) \\exp(i\\omega t) = \\Delta T \\exp(-kx) \\exp\\big(i(\\omega t - kx)\\big)\n$$\nThe physical solution for the input $\\Delta T \\sin(\\omega t)$ is the imaginary part of this complex solution:\n$$\n\\theta_{ss}(x,t) = \\text{Im}[\\theta_{c,ss}(x,t)] = \\text{Im}\\left[ \\Delta T \\exp(-kx) \\Big(\\cos(\\omega t - kx) + i\\sin(\\omega t - kx)\\Big) \\right]\n$$\n$$\n\\theta_{ss}(x,t) = \\Delta T \\exp(-kx) \\sin(\\omega t - kx)\n$$\nThis solution has the required form $A(x)\\sin(\\omega t - \\phi(x))$, where the amplitude attenuation is\n$$\nA(x) = \\Delta T \\exp(-kx) = \\Delta T \\exp\\left(-x\\sqrt{\\frac{\\omega}{2\\alpha}}\\right)\n$$\nand the phase lag is\n$$\n\\phi(x) = kx = x\\sqrt{\\frac{\\omega}{2\\alpha}}\n$$\n\n**Part 3: Final Expression for Steady-Periodic Temperature**\n\nThe final expression for the steady-periodic temperature field $T(x,t)$ is obtained by adding the initial temperature $T_i$ back to the steady-periodic excess temperature $\\theta_{ss}(x,t)$.\n$$\nT(x,t) = T_i + \\theta_{ss}(x,t)\n$$\nSubstituting the derived expression for $\\theta_{ss}(x,t)$:\n$$\nT(x,t) = T_i + \\Delta T \\exp\\left(-x\\sqrt{\\frac{\\omega}{2\\alpha}}\\right) \\sin\\left(\\omega t - x\\sqrt{\\frac{\\omega}{2\\alpha}}\\right)\n$$\nThis is the final closed-form expression, given entirely in terms of the specified parameters.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{T_i + \\Delta T \\exp\\left(-x\\sqrt{\\frac{\\omega}{2\\alpha}}\\right) \\sin\\left(\\omega t - x\\sqrt{\\frac{\\omega}{2\\alpha}}\\right)}\n$$", "id": "2534273"}]}
