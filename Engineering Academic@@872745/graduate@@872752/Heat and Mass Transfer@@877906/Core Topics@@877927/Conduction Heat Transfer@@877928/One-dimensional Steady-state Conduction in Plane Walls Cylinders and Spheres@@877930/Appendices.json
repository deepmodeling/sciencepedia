This exercise is foundational because it forces a rigorous application of first principles to cylindrical coordinates, particularly the physical requirement that the temperature must be finite at the cylinder's axis. By working through this problem [@problem_id:2513124], you will develop a deeper understanding of how mathematical solutions are constrained by physical reality, a crucial skill for correctly modeling heat transfer in non-planar geometries.", "problem": "An infinitely long, homogeneous, isotropic solid cylinder of radius $R$ and constant thermal conductivity $k$ is in steady state with no internal volumetric heat generation. Heat conduction is strictly one-dimensional in the radial direction, so the temperature depends only on the radial coordinate $r$.

It is a standard problem in the field of heat and mass transfer, specifically concerning one-dimensional steady-state conduction. The givens are sufficient and non-contradictory. Therefore, the problem is valid, and a solution will be derived from first principles as requested.\n\nThe analysis begins with the principle of conservation of energy applied to a control volume within the solid cylinder. Consider a cylindrical shell of infinitesimal thickness $dr$ at a radial location $r$, with a length $L$. The cylinder is homogeneous and isotropic with constant thermal conductivity $k$. The problem specifies a steady state ($\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t} = 0$) and no internal heat generation ($\\dot{q}_{gen} = 0$). Conduction is purely one-dimensional in the radial direction ($r$).\n\nThe energy balance equation for the control volume is:\n$$ \\dot{E}_{in} - \\dot{E}_{out} + \\dot{E}_{gen} = \\dot{E}_{st} $$\nGiven the problem conditions, the rate of energy generation $\\dot{E}_{gen}$ is zero, and the rate of change of stored energy $\\dot{E}_{st}$ is zero (steady state). Thus, the energy balance simplifies to:\n$$ \\dot{E}_{in} = \\dot{E}_{out} $$\nLet $\\dot{Q}_r$ be the rate of heat transfer in the radial direction. The energy entering the control volume is the heat conducted through the inner cylindrical surface at radius $r$, which is $\\dot{Q}_r$. The energy leaving is the heat conducted through the outer surface at radius $r+dr$, which is $\\dot{Q}_{r+dr}$. The balance becomes:\n$$ \\dot{Q}_r = \\dot{Q}_{r+dr} $$\nThis implies that the radial heat transfer rate $\\dot{Q}_r$ must be constant with respect to $r$.\n\nAccording to Fourier's law of heat conduction, the heat transfer rate is given by:\n$$ \\dot{Q}_r = -k A_r \\frac{dT}{dr} $$\nwhere $A_r$ is the surface area for heat transfer at radius $r$. For a cylinder of length $L$, this area is $A_r = 2 \\pi r L$. Substituting this into the expression for $\\dot{Q}_r$:\n$$ \\dot{Q}_r = -k (2 \\pi r L) \\frac{dT}{dr} $$\nSince $\\dot{Q}_r$ is constant, and $k$, $2$, $\\pi$, and $L$ are also constants, it follows that the quantity $r \\frac{dT}{dr}$ must be a constant. Let us formalize this by returning to the differential energy balance.\nThe relation $\\dot{Q}_r = \\dot{Q}_{r+dr}$ can be written as $\\dot{Q}_{r+dr} - \\dot{Q}_r = 0$. Dividing by the volume of the shell, $dV = 2 \\pi r L dr$, and taking the limit as $dr \\to 0$ would lead to the general heat diffusion equation. Alternatively, and more directly for this problem, we can express $\\dot{Q}_{r+dr}$ using a Taylor series expansion around $r$:\n$$ \\dot{Q}_{r+dr} = \\dot{Q}_r + \\frac{d\\dot{Q}_r}{dr}dr + O((dr)^2) $$\nSubstituting this into the energy balance $\\dot{Q}_{r+dr} - \\dot{Q}_r = 0$ gives:\n$$ \\frac{d\\dot{Q}_r}{dr}dr = 0 $$\nSince $dr$ is non-zero, this requires $\\frac{d\\dot{Q}_r}{dr} = 0$.\n\nNow, we substitute the expression for $\\dot{Q}_r$ from Fourier's law:\n$$ \\frac{d}{dr} \\left( -k (2 \\pi r L) \\frac{dT}{dr} \\right) = 0 $$\nSince $-k$, $2$, $\\pi$, and $L$ are non-zero constants, they can be divided out, yielding the governing ordinary differential equation for the temperature field $T(r)$:\n$$ \\frac{d}{dr} \\left( r \\frac{dT}{dr} \\right) = 0 $$\nThis completes the first part of the task.\n\nFor the second part, we solve this differential equation. We integrate with respect to $r$ once:\n$$ \\int \\frac{d}{dr} \\left( r \\frac{dT}{dr} \\right) dr = \\int 0 dr $$\n$$ r \\frac{dT}{dr} = C_1 $$\nwhere $C_1$ is the first constant of integration. To isolate the derivative $\\frac{dT}{dr}$, we divide by $r$ (for $r \\neq 0$):\n$$ \\frac{dT}{dr} = \\frac{C_1}{r} $$\nWe integrate a second time with respect to $r$:\n$$ \\int dT = \\int \\frac{C_1}{r} dr $$\n$$ T(r) = C_1 \\ln(r) + C_2 $$\nwhere $C_2$ is the second constant of integration. This is the general form of the solution for $T(r)$.\n\nFor the third part, we determine the constants $C_1$ and $C_2$ by applying the physical constraints and boundary conditions.\nThe first condition is the physical admissibility (regularity) at the centerline of the cylinder, $r=0$. The problem states that the temperature field must be finite everywhere, including at the axis. The general solution is $T(r) = C_1 \\ln(r) + C_2$. As $r \\to 0$, the natural logarithm term $\\ln(r) \\to -\\infty$. If the constant $C_1$ were non-zero, the temperature at the centerline $T(0)$ would be singular (infinite). This is physically impossible and would correspond to a line source or sink of infinite strength at the axis, which is explicitly excluded by the problem statement. Therefore, to ensure a finite temperature at $r=0$, the coefficient of the logarithmic term must be zero.\n$$ C_1 = 0 $$\nThis condition reduces the temperature distribution to:\n$$ T(r) = C_2 $$\nThis means the temperature must be uniform throughout the cylinder.\n\nThe second condition is the boundary condition at the outer surface, $r=R$. The problem specifies that the temperature is maintained at a fixed, uniform value $T_s$.\n$$ T(R) = T_s $$\nApplying this condition to our simplified solution $T(r) = C_2$:\n$$ T(R) = C_2 = T_s $$\nThus, the constant $C_2$ must be equal to the surface temperature $T_s$.\n\nSubstituting the values of $C_1=0$ and $C_2=T_s$ into the general solution, we obtain the final expression for the temperature distribution within the cylinder for $0 \\le r \\le R$:\n$$ T(r) = T_s $$\nThis result is physically logical. In a steady-state system with no internal heat sources, a temperature gradient can only be maintained by a net flow of heat. Since the outer surface is at a uniform temperature $T_s$ and there are no sources or sinks within the domain, there can be no net heat flow in the radial direction. According to Fourier's law, zero heat flow ($\\dot{Q}_r=0$) implies a zero temperature gradient ($\\frac{dT}{dr}=0$). This means the temperature must be constant throughout the material. Since the temperature is $T_s$ at the boundary $r=R$, it must be $T_s$ everywhere.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{T(r) = T_s}\n$$", "id": "2513124"}, {"introduction": "This next practice introduces two common complexities: uniform internal heat generation and a temperature-dependent thermal conductivity, $k(T)$.

It presents a standard scenario in heat transfer that can be analyzed rigorously from first principles. Therefore, we will proceed with the derivation.\n\nThe analysis begins with the fundamental principle of energy conservation applied to a differential control volume within the plane wall. For steady, one-dimensional heat transfer in the $x$-direction with internal heat generation, the energy balance on a control volume of infinitesimal thickness $dx$ and cross-sectional area $A$ is:\n$$ (A q''_x)|_x - (A q''_x)|_{x+dx} + \\dot{q}''' (A \\, dx) = 0 $$\nwhere $q''_x$ is the heat flux in the $x$-direction and $\\dot{q}'''$ is the uniform volumetric heat generation rate.

Substituting Fourier's law into the energy equation gives the governing differential equation for the temperature distribution $T(x)$:\n$$ \\frac{d}{dx} \\left( -k(T) \\frac{dT}{dx} \\right) = \\dot{q}''' $$\n$$ \\frac{d}{dx} \\left( k(T) \\frac{dT}{dx} \\right) + \\dot{q}''' = 0 $$\n\nThe boundary conditions are:\n1.  At $x=0$, the boundary is insulated (adiabatic). This means there is zero heat flux across this surface: $q''_x(0) = 0$.\n2.  At $x=L$, the boundary is maintained at a constant temperature: $T(L) = T_s$.\n\nWe can explain, from first principles, why the temperature gradient must vanish at the insulated boundary. By definition, an insulated boundary has zero heat flux, $q''_x = 0$. According to Fourier's law, $q''_x = -k(T) \\frac{dT}{dx}$. For this equality to hold where $q''_x = 0$, and given that the thermal conductivity $k(T)$ is a finite, positive physical property (since $k_0  0$), it is a mathematical necessity that the temperature gradient $\\frac{dT}{dx}$ must be zero at that location. Therefore, $\\left. \\frac{dT}{dx} \\right|_{x=0} = 0$.\n\nIntegrating the energy equation $\\frac{dq''_x}{dx} = \\dot{q}'''$ with respect to $x$ gives:\n$$ q''_x(x) = \\dot{q}''' x + C_1 $$\nApplying the first boundary condition, $q''_x(0) = 0$, we find the integration constant $C_1$:\n$$ q''_x(0) = \\dot{q}''' (0) + C_1 \\implies C_1 = 0 $$\nThus, the expression for the heat flux at any position $x$ is:\n$$ q''_x(x) = \\dot{q}''' x $$\nThis result is derived directly from the energy balance and the adiabatic boundary condition. It shows that the local heat flux is equal to the total heat generated per unit area in the region from $0$ to $x$.\n\nThe outward heat rate per unit area at the face $x=L$ is precisely the heat flux at this location, $q''_x(L)$. Using the expression derived above:\n$$ q''_x(L) = \\dot{q}''' L $$\nThis result follows from a simple macroscopic energy balance on the entire wall: in steady state, the total heat generated within the wall, $\\dot{q}''' L A$, must equal the net heat rate leaving its boundaries. Since the boundary at $x=0$ is adiabatic, all generated heat must exit through the boundary at $x=L$. The heat rate per unit area is therefore $\\dot{q}''' L$. This result is independent of the specific form of the thermal conductivity $k(T)$.\n\nAlthough the primary required answer has been found, the problem also asks for the derivation of the temperature distribution $T(x)$, which we now complete.

The equation becomes a quadratic equation for $\\theta$:\n$$ \\frac{\\beta}{2}\\theta^2 + \\theta - \\frac{\\dot{q}'''}{2k_0}(L^2 - x^2) = 0 $$\nSolving for $\\theta$ using the quadratic formula:\n$$ \\theta = \\frac{-1 \\pm \\sqrt{1 - 4(\\frac{\\beta}{2})(-\\frac{\\dot{q}'''}{2k_0}(L^2 - x^2))}}{2(\\frac{\\beta}{2})} = \\frac{-1 \\pm \\sqrt{1 + \\frac{\\beta\\dot{q}'''}{k_0}(L^2 - x^2)}}{\\beta} $$\nTo obtain a physically meaningful solution that recovers the constant conductivity case as $\\beta \\to 0$, we must select the positive root.

From the expression $\\frac{dT}{dr} = -\\frac{\\dot{q}''' r}{2k} + \\frac{C_1}{r}$, this requires the integration constant $C_1$ to be zero. Thus, the temperature gradient at any radius $r$ is:\n$$\n\\frac{dT}{dr} = -\\frac{\\dot{q}''' r}{2k}\n$$\nAt the outer surface ($r=R$), the temperature gradient is:\n$$\n\\left.\\frac{dT}{dr}\\right|_{r=R} = -\\frac{\\dot{q}''' R}{2k}\n$$\nThe second boundary condition equates the conductive heat flux out of the cylinder at $r=R$ to the convective heat flux into the ambient fluid.

The total heat generated must be removed, irrespective of the internal temperature distribution or the material's conductive properties, which only determine *how* the heat is conducted to the surface.\n\n**2. Uncertainty Propagation Analysis**\n\nWe use the a first-order Taylor series expansion (linear approximation) to propagate uncertainties. For a function $Y=f(X_1, X_2, \\dots, X_N)$, the combined standard uncertainty $u(y)$ is given by:\n$$\nu^2(y) \\approx \\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\left(\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x_i}\\right)^2 u^2(x_i)\n$$\nwhere $x_i$ are the estimates of the quantities $X_i$ and the partial derivatives are evaluated at these estimates.\n\nUncertainty in $\\dot{q}'''_{\\mathrm{conv}}$:\n\nThe estimator is $\\dot{q}'''_{\\mathrm{conv}} = \\frac{2h(T_s - T_{\\infty})}{R}$. Uncertainty is specified only for $h$, with standard uncertainty $u_h$.\n$$\nu^2(\\dot{q}'''_{\\mathrm{conv}}) = \\left(\\frac{\\partial \\dot{q}'''_{\\mathrm{conv}}}{\\partial h}\\right)^2 u_h^2\n$$\nThe required partial derivative is:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial \\dot{q}'''_{\\mathrm{conv}}}{\\partial h} = \\frac{2(T_s - T_{\\infty})}{R}\n$$\nSubstituting this into the uncertainty formula gives:\n$$\nu^2(\\dot{q}'''_{\\mathrm{conv}}) = \\left(\\frac{2(T_s - T_{\\infty})}{R}\\right)^2 u_h^2\n$$\nTaking the square root, the standard uncertainty is:\n$$\nu(\\dot{q}'''_{\\mathrm{conv}}) = \\frac{2(T_s - T_{\\infty})}{R} u_h\n$$\nThis can be expressed compactly in terms of relative uncertainty: $\\frac{u(\\dot{q}'''_{\\mathrm{conv}})}{\\dot{q}'''_{\\mathrm{conv}}} = \\frac{u_h}{h}$.\n\nUncertainty in $\\dot{q}'''_{\\mathrm{loss}}$:\n\nThe estimator is $\\dot{q}'''_{\\mathrm{loss}} = \\frac{\\dot{Q}'}{\\pi R^2}$. Uncertainty is specified only for $\\dot{Q}'$, with standard uncertainty $u_{\\dot{Q}'}$.\n$$\nu^2(\\dot{q}'''_{\\mathrm{loss}}) = \\left(\\frac{\\partial \\dot{q}'''_{\\mathrm{loss}}}{\\partial \\dot{Q}'}\\right)^2 u_{\\dot{Q}'}^2\n$$\nThe partial derivative is:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial \\dot{q}'''_{\\mathrm{loss}}}{\\partial \\dot{Q}'} = \\frac{1}{\\pi R^2}\n$$\nThus, the variance is:\n$$\nu^2(\\dot{q}'''_{\\mathrm{loss}}) = \\left(\\frac{1}{\\pi R^2}\\right)^2 u_{\\dot{Q}'}^2\n$$\nAnd the standard uncertainty is:\n$$\nu(\\dot{q}'''_{\\mathrm{loss}}) = \\frac{u_{\\dot{Q}'}}{\\pi R^2}\n$$\nIn terms of relative uncertainty: $\\frac{u(\\dot{q}'''_{\\mathrm{loss}})}{\\dot{q}'''_{\\mathrm{loss}}} = \\frac{u_{\\dot{Q}'}}{\\dot{Q}'}$.\n\n**3. Data Fusion and Consistency Diagnostic**\n\nWe must combine the two independent estimates, $x_1 = \\dot{q}'''_{\\mathrm{conv}}$ and $x_2 = \\dot{q}'''_{\\mathrm{loss}}$, into a single fused estimate with minimum variance. The estimates are assumed to be unbiased and their errors uncorrelated. Let their variances be $\\sigma_1^2 = u^2(\\dot{q}'''_{\\mathrm{conv}})$ and $\\sigma_2^2 = u^2(\\dot{q}'''_{\\mathrm{loss}})$.\n\nThe optimal fused estimate, $\\dot{q}'''_{\\mathrm{fused}}$, is the inverse-variance weighted average:\n$$\n\\dot{q}'''_{\\mathrm{fused}} = \\frac{x_1/\\sigma_1^2 + x_2/\\sigma_2^2}{1/\\sigma_1^2 + 1/\\sigma_2^2}\n$$\nThe variance of this fused estimate, $\\sigma_f^2 = u^2(\\dot{q}'''_{\\mathrm{fused}})$, is given by:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{\\sigma_f^2} = \\frac{1}{\\sigma_1^2} + \\frac{1}{\\sigma_2^2} \\implies \\sigma_f^2 = \\frac{\\sigma_1^2 \\sigma_2^2}{\\sigma_1^2 + \\sigma_2^2}\n$$\nThe fused standard uncertainty is therefore $u(\\dot{q}'''_{\\mathrm{fused}}) = \\sigma_f$.\n\nFor the consistency diagnostic, we compute the normalized difference between the two estimators, which follows a standard normal distribution under the null hypothesis that both estimators measure the same true value. This statistic, or $z$-score, is:\n$$\nz = \\frac{x_1 - x_2}{\\sqrt{\\sigma_1^2 + \\sigma_2^2}} = \\frac{\\dot{q}'''_{\\mathrm{conv}} - \\dot{q}'''_{\\mathrm{loss}}}{\\sqrt{u^2(\\dot{q}'''_{\\mathrm{conv}}) + u^2(\\dot{q}'''_{\\mathrm{loss}})}}\n$$\nThe two estimates are declared \"consistent\" if the magnitude of this statistic does not exceed $2$, i.e., $|z| \\leq 2$. This threshold corresponds to an approximate $95\\%$ confidence level.\n\nThese derived expressions are now implemented to process the provided test cases.", "answer": "```python\n# The complete and runnable Python 3 code goes here.\n# Imports must adhere to the specified execution environment.\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves the heat transfer problem for four test cases, calculating two independent\n    estimates of volumetric heat generation, their uncertainties, a fused estimate,\n    its uncertainty, and a consistency check.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Define the test cases from the problem statement.\n    # (R, T_inf, T_s, h, u_h, Q_prime, u_Q_prime) in SI units.\n    test_cases = [\n        # Case A\n        (0.01, 300, 350, 100, 5, 315, 10),\n        # Case B\n        (0.001, 293, 343, 200, 20, 60, 3),\n        # Case C\n        (0.05, 300, 320, 500, 100, 3200, 200),\n        # Case D\n        (0.02, 300, 330, 150, 5, 700, 10),\n    ]\n\n    all_results_str = []\n    \n    for case in test_cases:\n        R, T_inf, T_s, h, u_h, Q_prime, u_Q_prime = case\n        \n        # 1.
