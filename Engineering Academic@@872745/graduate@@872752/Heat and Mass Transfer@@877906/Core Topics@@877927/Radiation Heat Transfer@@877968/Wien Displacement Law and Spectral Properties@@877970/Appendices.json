The validation of the problem statement confirms that it is scientifically sound, well-posed, and objective. We proceed with the solution.\n\nPlanck's law for the spectral radiance per unit wavelength, $B_{\\lambda}(T)$, is given by\n$$B_{\\lambda}(T) = \\frac{2 h c^2}{\\lambda^5} \\frac{1}{\\exp\\left(\\frac{h c}{\\lambda k_B T}\\right) - 1}$$\nwhere $h$ is the Planck constant, $c$ is the speed of light, $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant, $T$ is the absolute temperature, and $\\lambda$ is the wavelength.\n\nTo find the wavelength $\\lambda_{\\text{max}}$ at which $B_{\\lambda}(T)$ is maximum for a fixed temperature $T$, we must solve the equation $\\frac{d B_{\\lambda}(T)}{d \\lambda} = 0$.\n\nLet us introduce the dimensionless variable $x \\equiv \\frac{h c}{\\lambda k_B T}$. From this definition, we can express $\\lambda$ as $\\lambda = \\frac{h c}{x k_B T}$. Substituting this into the expression for $B_{\\lambda}(T)$ yields:\n$$B_{\\lambda}(T) = \\frac{2 h c^2}{\\left(\\frac{h c}{x k_B T}\\right)^5} \\frac{1}{\\exp(x) - 1} = \\left(\\frac{2 k_B^5 T^5}{h^4 c^3}\\right) \\frac{x^5}{\\exp(x) - 1}$$\nTo find the maximum of $B_{\\lambda}(T)$ with respect to $\\lambda$, we can find the maximum with respect to $x$. Using the chain rule, $\\frac{d B_{\\lambda}}{d \\lambda} = \\frac{d B_{\\lambda}}{d x} \\frac{d x}{d \\lambda}$. The derivative $\\frac{d x}{d \\lambda} = -\\frac{h c}{\\lambda^2 k_B T}$ is non-zero for finite $\\lambda$.

Thus, we only need to maximize the function $f(x) = \\frac{x^5}{\\exp(x) - 1}$.

This completes the first part of the problem.\n\nFor the second part, we relate $x^{\\star}$ to the Wien displacement constant $b$. By definition, $\\lambda_{\\text{max}} T = b$. The value $\\lambda_{\\text{max}}$ corresponds to the value $x^{\\star}$ through the relation:\n$$x^{\\star} = \\frac{h c}{\\lambda_{\\text{max}} k_B T}$$\nSubstituting $\\lambda_{\\text{max}} T = b$ into this equation gives:\n$$x^{\\star} = \\frac{h c}{k_B b}$$\nSolving for $b$, we find the expression for the displacement constant:\n$$b = \\frac{h c}{x^{\\star} k_B}$$\nThis completes the second part.\n\nFor the third part, we must compute the numerical value of $b$. First, the transcendental equation $x = 5(1 - \\exp(-x))$ must be solved for $x^{\\star}$. This is accomplished using a numerical root-finding algorithm, such as Newton's method.

Our calculated value matches the reference value to all ten significant figures.\n\nThe commentary on uncertainty is as follows. The problem correctly states that the given SI values for $h$, $c$, and $k_B$ are exact. This reflects the 2019 redefinition of SI base units, where these fundamental constants were assigned fixed numerical values, thereby having zero uncertainty by definition. The constant $x^{\\star}$ is a purely mathematical constant, being the solution to a specific transcendental equation, and as such, it can be computed to arbitrary precision and has no uncertainty. Since $b$ is expressed as a combination of these exact quantities ($b = \\frac{h c}{x^{\\star} k_B}$), the Wien displacement constant $b$ is also an exact quantity within the current SI framework. There are no sources of uncertainty in its determination from fundamental principles. Prior to the 2019 SI redefinition, constants such as $h$ and $k_B$ were experimentally determined and carried measurement uncertainties, which propagated to the calculated value of $b$. The redefinition has eliminated this source of uncertainty in the value of the constant itself. Any experimental uncertainty is now associated with the realization of the units (e.g., kilogram, kelvin) rather than the values of the fundamental constants.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{2.897771955 \\times 10^{-3}}$$", "id": "2538969"}, {"introduction": "A common point of confusion in spectral analysis is how the shape and peak of a distribution change when we switch variables—for instance, from wavelength to frequency.

The solution will now be developed.\n\nThe solution is presented in three parts, corresponding to the tasks assigned.\n\n**Part 1: Derivation of the Transformation Law**\n\nThe fundamental principle governing the transformation of a spectral density function is the conservation of energy within a differential spectral interval. The energy radiated per unit area, $dM$, in an interval is invariant with respect to the choice of spectral variable. Using SI units for wavelength ($\\lambda$ in meters, $\\mathrm{m}$) and frequency ($\\nu$ in Hertz, $\\mathrm{Hz}$), this is expressed as:\n$$dM = M_{\\lambda}(\\lambda, T) |d\\lambda| = M_{\\nu}(\\nu, T) |d\\nu|$$\nwhere $M_{\\lambda}$ has units of $\\mathrm{W\\, m^{-3}}$ and $M_{\\nu}$ has units of $\\mathrm{W\\, m^{-2}\\, Hz^{-1}}$.\n\nThe problem, however, uses non-standard units: wavelength $\\lambda_{\\mathrm{nm}}$ in nanometers ($\\mathrm{nm}$) and frequency $\\nu_{\\mathrm{THz}}$ in terahertz ($\\mathrm{THz}$). The corresponding spectral emissive powers are $M_{\\lambda,\\mathrm{nm}}$ and $M_{\\nu,\\mathrm{THz}}$. The conservation of energy must hold for these variables as well:\n$$dM = M_{\\lambda,\\mathrm{nm}}(\\lambda_{\\mathrm{nm}}, T) |d\\lambda_{\\mathrm{nm}}| = M_{\\nu,\\mathrm{THz}}(\\nu_{\\mathrm{THz}}, T) |d\\nu_{\\mathrm{THz}}|$$\nFrom this, we derive the transformation rule:\n$$M_{\\nu,\\mathrm{THz}}(\\nu_{\\mathrm{THz}}, T) = M_{\\lambda,\\mathrm{nm}}(\\lambda_{\\mathrm{nm}}, T) \\left| \\frac{d\\lambda_{\\mathrm{nm}}}{d\\nu_{\\mathrm{THz}}} \\right|$$\nThe term $\\left| \\frac{d\\lambda_{\\mathrm{nm}}}{d\\nu_{\\mathrm{THz}}} \\right|$ is the Jacobian of the transformation between the specified coordinate systems.\n\nTo compute this Jacobian, we must first establish the relationship between $\\lambda_{\\mathrm{nm}}$ and $\\nu_{\\mathrm{THz}}$. The fundamental physical relation is $\\lambda \\nu = c$, where $\\lambda$ is in meters and $\\nu$ is in Hertz. The unit conversions are:\n$$\\lambda = \\lambda_{\\mathrm{nm}} \\times 10^{-9} \\ \\mathrm{m}$$\n$$\\nu = \\nu_{\\mathrm{THz}} \\times 10^{12} \\ \\mathrm{Hz}$$\nSubstituting these into the physical relation:\n$$(\\lambda_{\\mathrm{nm}} \\times 10^{-9}) (\\nu_{\\mathrm{THz}} \\times 10^{12}) = c$$\n$$\\lambda_{\\mathrm{nm}} \\nu_{\\mathrm{THz}} = c \\times 10^{-3}$$\nThis gives the relationship between the numerical values of the variables. We can now express $\\lambda_{\\mathrm{nm}}$ as a function of $\\nu_{\\mathrm{THz}}$:\n$$\\lambda_{\\mathrm{nm}}(\\nu_{\\mathrm{THz}}) = \\frac{c \\times 10^{-3}}{\\nu_{\\mathrm{THz}}}$$\nThe Jacobian is the magnitude of the derivative:\n$$\\left| \\frac{d\\lambda_{\\mathrm{nm}}}{d\\nu_{\\mathrm{THz}}} \\right| = \\left| -\\frac{c \\times 10^{-3}}{\\nu_{\\mathrm{THz}}^2} \\right| = \\frac{c \\times 10^{-3}}{\\nu_{\\mathrm{THz}}^2}$$\nThis term explicitly shows the dependence on the physical constant $c$ and the scaling factors between the unit systems ($\\mathrm{nm}$ vs. $\\mathrm{m}$ and $\\mathrm{THz}$ vs. $\\mathrm{Hz}$), which are contained in the $10^{-3}$ factor.\n\nTherefore, the explicit expression for the transformation is:\n$$M_{\\nu,\\mathrm{THz}}(\\nu_{\\mathrm{THz}}, T) = M_{\\lambda,\\mathrm{nm}}\\left(\\frac{c \\times 10^{-3}}{\\nu_{\\mathrm{THz}}}, T\\right) \\left(\\frac{c \\times 10^{-3}}{\\nu_{\\mathrm{THz}}^2}\\right)$$\nHere, the argument of $M_{\\lambda,\\mathrm{nm}}$ is replaced with its equivalent expression in terms of $\\nu_{\\mathrm{THz}}$.\n\n**Part 2: Comparison of Spectral Peak Locations**\n\nThe peak of the blackbody spectrum occurs at different locations depending on whether the spectrum is parameterized by wavelength or frequency. This is a direct consequence of the non-linear Jacobian factor in the transformation derived in Part 1.\n\nFirst, consider the spectral emissive power per unit wavelength (in SI units), given by Planck's law:\n$$M_{\\lambda}(\\lambda, T) = \\frac{2 \\pi h c^2}{\\lambda^5 \\left[\\exp\\left(\\frac{hc}{\\lambda k_B T}\\right) - 1\\right]}$$\nTo find the wavelength $\\lambda_{\\mathrm{peak},\\lambda}$ at which $M_{\\lambda}$ is maximum, we set its derivative with respect to $\\lambda$ to zero. This is equivalent to finding the minimum of the denominator, or more simply, finding the extremum of $\\lambda^{-5} \\left[\\exp\\left(\\frac{hc}{\\lambda k_B T}\\right) - 1\\right]^{-1}$. A simpler approach is to take the logarithm and differentiate. Let $f(\\lambda) = \\ln(M_{\\lambda}) = \\ln(2\\pi h c^2) - 5\\ln(\\lambda) - \\ln\\left[\\exp\\left(\\frac{hc}{\\lambda k_B T}\\right) - 1\\right]$.\n$$\\frac{d f(\\lambda)}{d\\lambda} = -\\frac{5}{\\lambda} - \\frac{1}{\\exp\\left(\\frac{hc}{\\lambda k_B T}\\right) - 1} \\cdot \\exp\\left(\\frac{hc}{\\lambda k_B T}\\right) \\cdot \\left(-\\frac{hc}{\\lambda^2 k_B T}\\right) = 0$$\nLet $x = \\frac{hc}{\\lambda k_B T}$. The equation simplifies to:\n$$-\\frac{5}{\\lambda} + \\frac{1}{\\lambda} \\frac{x \\exp(x)}{\\exp(x) - 1} = 0$$\n$$5 = \\frac{x e^x}{e^x - 1} \\implies 5(e^x - 1) = x e^x \\implies (5-x)e^x = 5$$\nThis is a transcendental equation for $x$. The solution, which we denote as $x_{\\lambda}$, must be found numerically: $x_{\\lambda} \\approx 4.965114$. This gives Wien's displacement law:\n$$\\frac{hc}{\\lambda_{\\mathrm{peak},\\lambda} k_B T} = x_{\\lambda} \\implies \\lambda_{\\mathrm{peak},\\lambda} T = \\frac{hc}{x_{\\lambda} k_B} = \\text{constant}$$\nNext, consider the spectral emissive power per unit frequency (in SI units):\n$$M_{\\nu}(\\nu, T) = \\frac{2 \\pi h \\nu^3}{c^2 \\left[\\exp\\left(\\frac{h\\nu}{k_B T}\\right) - 1\\right]}$$\nTo find the frequency $\\nu_{\\mathrm{peak},\\nu}$ at which $M_{\\nu}$ is maximum, we set its derivative with respect to $\\nu$ to zero. Let $g(\\nu) = \\ln(M_{\\nu}) = \\ln(2\\pi h / c^2) + 3\\ln(\\nu) - \\ln\\left[\\exp\\left(\\frac{h\\nu}{k_B T}\\right) - 1\\right]$.\n$$\\frac{d g(\\nu)}{d\\nu} = \\frac{3}{\\nu} - \\frac{1}{\\exp\\left(\\frac{h\\nu}{k_B T}\\right) - 1} \\cdot \\exp\\left(\\frac{h\\nu}{k_B T}\\right) \\cdot \\left(\\frac{h}{k_B T}\\right) = 0$$\nLet $y = \\frac{h\\nu}{k_B T}$. The equation simplifies to:\n$$\\frac{3}{\\nu} = \\frac{1}{\\nu} \\frac{y \\exp(y)}{\\exp(y) - 1} \\implies 3(e^y - 1) = y e^y \\implies (3-y)e^y = 3$$\nThis is another transcendental equation for $y$. Its numerical solution, denoted $y_{\\nu}$, is $y_{\\nu} \\approx 2.821439$. This gives the frequency form of Wien's law:\n$$\\frac{h\\nu_{\\mathrm{peak},\\nu}}{k_B T} = y_{\\nu} \\implies \\frac{\\nu_{\\mathrm{peak},\\nu}}{T} = \\frac{y_{\\nu} k_B}{h} = \\text{constant}$$\nThe reason $\\nu_{\\mathrm{peak},\\nu} \\neq c/\\lambda_{\\mathrm{peak},\\lambda}$ is that maximizing $M_{\\lambda}$ is not equivalent to maximizing $M_{\\nu}$. The transformation is $M_{\\nu}(\\nu) = M_{\\lambda}(c/\\nu) \\cdot (c/\\nu^2)$. The presence of the Jacobian factor $c/\\nu^2$ shifts the location of the maximum. Maximizing $M_{\\lambda}(\\lambda)$ is maximizing the function $F(\\lambda)$, while maximizing $M_{\\nu}(\\nu)$ is maximizing the different function $G(\\nu) = F(c/\\nu) \\cdot (c/\\nu^2)$. These are separate optimization problems.\n\nTo find the dimensionless ratio, we use the results from the stationarity conditions:\n$$\\lambda_{\\mathrm{peak},\\lambda} = \\frac{hc}{x_{\\lambda} k_B T}$$\n$$\\nu_{\\mathrm{peak},\\nu} = \\frac{y_{\\nu} k_B T}{h}$$\nMultiplying these two expressions gives:\n$$\\nu_{\\mathrm{peak},\\nu} \\lambda_{\\mathrm{peak},\\lambda} = \\left(\\frac{y_{\\nu} k_B T}{h}\\right) \\left(\\frac{hc}{x_{\\lambda} k_B T}\\right) = \\frac{y_{\\nu}}{x_{\\lambda}} c$$\nThe dimensionless ratio is therefore:\n$$\\frac{\\nu_{\\mathrm{peak},\\nu} \\lambda_{\\mathrm{peak},\\lambda}}{c} = \\frac{y_{\\nu}}{x_{\\lambda}}$$\nwhere $y_{\\nu}$ is the root of $(3-y)e^y = 3$ and $x_{\\lambda}$ is the root of $(5-x)e^x = 5$. Since $y_{\\nu} \\neq x_{\\lambda}$, this ratio is not equal to $1$.\n\n**Part 3: Numerical Computation of Peak Frequency**\n\nThe task is to compute $\\nu_{\\mathrm{peak},\\nu}$ in THz for $T = 2500 \\ \\mathrm{K}$. From Part 2, we have the relation:\n$$\\nu_{\\mathrm{peak},\\nu} = \\frac{y_{\\nu} k_B T}{h}$$\nUsing the provided constants and the value of $y_{\\nu} \\approx 2.821439$:\n$$h = 6.62607015 \\times 10^{-34} \\ \\mathrm{J \\cdot s}$$\n$$k_B = 1.380649 \\times 10^{-23} \\ \\mathrm{J/K}$$\n$$T = 2500 \\ \\mathrm{K}$$\nSubstituting these values:\n$$\\nu_{\\mathrm{peak},\\nu} = \\frac{(2.821439) \\times (1.380649 \\times 10^{-23} \\ \\mathrm{J/K}) \\times (2500 \\ \\mathrm{K})}{6.62607015 \\times 10^{-34} \\ \\mathrm{J \\cdot s}}$$\n$$\\nu_{\\mathrm{peak},\\nu} \\approx \\frac{9.73970 \\times 10^{-20} \\ \\mathrm{J}}{6.62607015 \\times 10^{-34} \\ \\mathrm{J \\cdot s}} \\approx 1.46986 \\times 10^{14} \\ \\mathrm{s^{-1}} \\ (\\text{or Hz})$$\nTo express this result in terahertz (THz), we use the conversion $1 \\ \\mathrm{THz} = 10^{12} \\ \\mathrm{Hz}$:\n$$\\nu_{\\mathrm{peak},\\nu} \\approx (1.46986 \\times 10^{14} \\ \\mathrm{Hz}) \\times \\left(\\frac{1 \\ \\mathrm{THz}}{10^{12} \\ \\mathrm{Hz}}\\right) \\approx 146.986 \\ \\mathrm{THz}$$\nRounding the answer to four significant figures as required by the problem statement yields $147.0 \\ \\mathrm{THz}$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{147.0}$$", "id": "2539036"}, {"introduction": "While Planck's law provides an exact description of blackbody radiation, simpler approximations are invaluable in specific regimes.

Planck's law for the spectral radiance $B_{\\lambda}(T)$ is given as:\n$$\nB_{\\lambda}(T)=\\frac{2 h c^{2}}{\\lambda^{5}}\\,\\frac{1}{\\exp\\!\\left(\\frac{h c}{\\lambda k_{B} T}\\right)-1}\n$$\nThe dimensionless variable $x$ is defined as $x \\equiv \\frac{h c}{\\lambda k_{B} T}$. In terms of $x$, Planck's law is proportional to $(\\exp(x)-1)^{-1}$.\n\nThe short-wavelength (Wien) approximation, which we denote as $B_{\\lambda, W}(T)$, is obtained by applying the limit $\\exp(x) - 1 \\approx \\exp(x)$ for $x \\gg 1$. Thus, the approximation is:\n$$\nB_{\\lambda, W}(T)=\\frac{2 h c^{2}}{\\lambda^{5}}\\,\\frac{1}{\\exp\\!\\left(\\frac{h c}{\\lambda k_{B} T}\\right)}\n$$\nIn terms of $x$, this approximation is proportional to $\\exp(-x)$.\n\nThe first task is to derive the relative error $\\varepsilon(x)$, defined as the absolute relative error of the approximation with respect to the exact Planck expression.\n$$\n\\varepsilon(x) = \\left| \\frac{B_{\\lambda, W}(T) - B_{\\lambda}(T)}{B_{\\lambda}(T)} \\right| = \\left| \\frac{B_{\\lambda, W}(T)}{B_{\\lambda}(T)} - 1 \\right|\n$$\nWe compute the ratio of the approximate radiance to the exact radiance:\n$$\n\\frac{B_{\\lambda, W}(T)}{B_{\\lambda}(T)} = \\frac{\\frac{2 h c^{2}}{\\lambda^{5}}\\,\\exp\\!\\left(-\\frac{h c}{\\lambda k_{B} T}\\right)}{\\frac{2 h c^{2}}{\\lambda^{5}}\\,\\left(\\exp\\!\\left(\\frac{h c}{\\lambda k_{B} T}\\right)-1\\right)^{-1}} = \\exp\\!\\left(-\\frac{h c}{\\lambda k_{B} T}\\right) \\left[ \\exp\\!\\left(\\frac{h c}{\\lambda k_{B} T}\\right)-1 \\right]\n$$\nSubstituting the dimensionless variable $x$, the ratio simplifies to:\n$$\n\\frac{B_{\\lambda, W}(T)}{B_{\\lambda}(T)} = \\exp(-x) \\left[ \\exp(x) - 1 \\right] = 1 - \\exp(-x)\n$$\nNow we substitute this back into the expression for the relative error:\n$$\n\\varepsilon(x) = |(1 - \\exp(-x)) - 1| = |-\\exp(-x)|\n$$\nFor any physical system, the absolute temperature $T$ and wavelength $\\lambda$ are positive quantities. The constants $h$, $c$, and $k_B$ are all positive. Therefore, $x = \\frac{h c}{\\lambda k_B T}$ must be positive. For any $x  0$, the function $\\exp(-x)$ is also positive. Consequently, the absolute value is redundant.\nThe relative error is:\n$$\n\\varepsilon(x) = \\exp(-x)\n$$\n\nThe second task is to determine the smallest value $x_{\\star}$ for which $\\varepsilon(x)  0.01$. The function $\\varepsilon(x) = \\exp(-x)$ is a strictly decreasing function for $x0$. Therefore, the inequality $\\varepsilon(x)  0.01$ defines an open interval for $x$. The phrasing \"smallest value\" is imprecise, as a set $(a, \\infty)$ has no minimum element. A rigorous interpretation would render the problem ill-posed. However, standard scientific and engineering parlance implies finding the boundary value of the domain of validity, which is the infimum of the set of solutions. We will proceed by finding this boundary value, which we shall call $x_{\\star}$. This value is where the error is exactly equal to the threshold.\nWe set the condition:\n$$\n\\varepsilon(x_{\\star}) = 0.01\n$$\n$$\n\\exp(-x_{\\star}) = 0.01 = \\frac{1}{100} = 10^{-2}\n$$\nTo solve for $x_{\\star}$, we take the natural logarithm of both sides:\n$$\n-x_{\\star} = \\ln(10^{-2})\n$$\n$$\n-x_{\\star} = -2\\ln(10)\n$$\n$$\nx_{\\star} = 2\\ln(10)\n$$\nAlternatively, and more directly:\n$$\n-x_{\\star} = \\ln(0.01) = \\ln\\left(\\frac{1}{100}\\right) = -\\ln(100)\n$$\n$$\nx_{\\star} = \\ln(100)\n$$\nThis is the exact, closed-form expression for the required value.\n\nFinally, we are asked to express the corresponding regime of validity as an inequality. The Wien approximation is valid to within $1\\%$ when $\\varepsilon(x)  0.01$, which corresponds to $x  x_{\\star}$.\n$$\nx  \\ln(100)\n$$\nSubstituting the definition of $x$:\n$$\n\\frac{h c}{\\lambda k_B T}  \\ln(100)\n$$\nRearranging to relate $\\lambda$ and $T$:\n$$\n\\lambda T  \\frac{h c}{k_B \\ln(100)}\n$$\nThis inequality defines the regime in terms of wavelength and temperature where the Wien approximation has a relative error of less than $1\\%$. The term $\\frac{h c}{k_B}$ is dimensionally a product of length and temperature (meter-Kelvin in SI units), consistent with the product $\\lambda T$. This completes the analysis.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\ln(100)}$$", "id": "2538981"}]}
