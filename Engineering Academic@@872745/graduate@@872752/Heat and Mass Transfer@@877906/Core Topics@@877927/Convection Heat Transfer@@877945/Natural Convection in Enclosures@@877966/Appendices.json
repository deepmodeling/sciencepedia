It describes a classic scenario in heat and mass transfer—natural convection in a differentially heated cavity—and asks for a standard boundary-layer scaling analysis. The problem is therefore valid.\n\nThe analysis begins with the steady-state Oberbeck–Boussinesq equations for an incompressible Newtonian fluid in two dimensions ($x$, $y$).\nThe continuity equation is:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x} + \\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial y} = 0 $$\nThe momentum equations are:\n$$ u\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x} + v\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial y} = -\\frac{1}{\\rho}\\frac{\\partial p'}{\\partial x} + \\nu \\left(\\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial x^2} + \\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial y^2}\\right) $$\n$$ u\\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial x} + v\\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial y} = -\\frac{1}{\\rho}\\frac{\\partial p'}{\\partial y} + \\nu \\left(\\frac{\\partial^2 v}{\\partial x^2} + \\frac{\\partial^2 v}{\\partial y^2}\\right) + g\\beta(T - T_c) $$\nThe energy equation is:\n$$ u\\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial x} + v\\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial y} = \\alpha \\left(\\frac{\\partial^2 T}{\\partial x^2} + \\frac{\\partial^2 T}{\\partial y^2}\\right) $$\nHere, $u$ and $v$ are the velocity components in the $x$ and $y$ directions, respectively, $p'$ is the dynamic pressure, $T$ is the temperature, and the fluid properties are density $\\rho$, kinematic viscosity $\\nu$, thermal diffusivity $\\alpha$, and thermal expansion coefficient $\\beta$. Gravity $g$ acts in the negative $y$ direction, but for the hot wall, the buoyancy force is positive upward, hence the sign in the $y$-momentum equation where we consider $v$ to be the upward velocity and the reference temperature is $T_c$.\n\nWe perform a scaling analysis for the thin thermal boundary layer of thickness $\\delta_T$ adjacent to the hot vertical wall ($x=0$). The characteristic length scales are $\\delta_T$ in the horizontal ($x$) direction and the cavity side length $L$ in the vertical ($y$) direction. The characteristic vertical velocity is $U$, and the characteristic temperature difference across the boundary layer is $\\Delta T = T_h - T_c$.\n\nFrom the continuity equation, we scale the velocity components:\n$$ \\frac{u}{\\delta_T} \\sim \\frac{v}{L} \\implies u \\sim U \\frac{\\delta_T}{L} $$\nSince $\\delta_T \\ll L$, the horizontal velocity component $u$ is much smaller than the vertical component $U$.\n\nNext, we apply scaling to the energy equation within the boundary layer. The terms are scaled as follows:\nVertical advection: $v\\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial y} \\sim U \\frac{\\Delta T}{L}$\nHorizontal advection: $u\\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial x} \\sim \\left(U\\frac{\\delta_T}{L}\\right)\\frac{\\Delta T}{\\delta_T} = U\\frac{\\Delta T}{L}$\nHorizontal diffusion: $\\alpha\\frac{\\partial^2 T}{\\partial x^2} \\sim \\alpha\\frac{\\Delta T}{\\delta_T^2}$\nVertical diffusion: $\\alpha\\frac{\\partial^2 T}{\\partial y^2} \\sim \\alpha\\frac{\\Delta T}{L^2}$\nSince $\\delta_T \\ll L$, horizontal diffusion $\\alpha\\frac{\\Delta T}{\\delta_T^2}$ is much larger than vertical diffusion $\\alpha\\frac{\\Delta T}{L^2}$. The primary balance in the energy equation is between advection and horizontal diffusion:\n$$ U\\frac{\\Delta T}{L} \\sim \\alpha\\frac{\\Delta T}{\\delta_T^2} \\implies U \\sim \\frac{\\alpha L}{\\delta_T^2} \\quad (1) $$\n\nNow, we perform a scaling analysis of the vertical ($y$) momentum equation. The terms scale as:\nInertial terms: $u\\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial x} \\sim \\left(U\\frac{\\delta_T}{L}\\right)\\frac{U}{\\delta_T} = \\frac{U^2}{L}$ and $v\\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial y} \\sim U\\frac{U}{L} = \\frac{U^2}{L}$.

Let's investigate the implication of this. The ratio of the inertial to viscous terms in the momentum balance is:\n$$ \\frac{I}{V} \\sim \\frac{U^2/L}{\\nu U / \\delta_T^2} = \\frac{U \\delta_T^2}{\\nu L} $$\nSubstituting for the product $U\\delta_T^2$ from the energy balance scaling (Equation 1), $U\\delta_T^2 \\sim \\alpha L$:\n$$ \\frac{I}{V} \\sim \\frac{\\alpha L}{\\nu L} = \\frac{\\alpha}{\\nu} = \\frac{1}{Pr} $$\nSince $Pr \\gg 1$, we have $I/V \\ll 1$. This means that inertial forces are negligible compared to viscous forces. The primary momentum balance is therefore between the viscous force and the buoyancy force:\n$$ \\frac{\\nu U}{\\delta_T^2} \\sim g\\beta\\Delta T \\implies U \\sim \\frac{g\\beta\\Delta T \\delta_T^2}{\\nu} \\quad (2) $$\nThis confirms that for a high-$Pr$ fluid, the momentum balance is viscously dominated.\n\nWe now have a system of two scaling relations for the two unknowns, $U$ and $\\delta_T$:\n1. From energy: $U \\sim \\frac{\\alpha L}{\\delta_T^2}$\n2. From momentum: $U \\sim \\frac{g\\beta\\Delta T \\delta_T^2}{\\nu}$\n\nWe can solve for $U$ by multiplying the two expressions:\n$$ U^2 \\sim \\left(\\frac{\\alpha L}{\\delta_T^2}\\right) \\left(\\frac{g\\beta\\Delta T \\delta_T^2}{\\nu}\\right) = \\frac{g\\beta\\Delta T \\alpha L}{\\nu} $$\n$$ U \\sim \\sqrt{\\frac{g\\beta\\Delta T \\alpha L}{\\nu}} $$\nThe Reynolds number is defined as $Re = UL/\\nu$. Substituting our scaling for $U$:\n$$ Re = \\frac{UL}{\\nu} \\sim \\frac{L}{\\nu} \\sqrt{\\frac{g\\beta\\Delta T \\alpha L}{\\nu}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{g\\beta\\Delta T \\alpha L^3}{\\nu^3}} $$\nTo express this in terms of the Rayleigh number, $Ra = \\frac{g \\beta \\Delta T L^{3}}{\\nu \\alpha}$, and the Prandtl number, $Pr = \\frac{\\nu}{\\alpha}$, we manipulate the expression for $Re$:\n$$ Re \\sim \\sqrt{\\frac{g \\beta \\Delta T L^{3}}{\\nu \\alpha} \\cdot \\frac{\\alpha^2}{\\nu^2}} = \\sqrt{Ra \\cdot \\left(\\frac{\\alpha}{\\nu}\\right)^2} = \\sqrt{Ra \\cdot \\left(\\frac{1}{Pr}\\right)^2} $$\nThis gives the final scaling expression for the Reynolds number:\n$$ Re \\sim \\frac{\\sqrt{Ra}}{Pr} $$\n\nThe second part of the problem asks for the condition under which inertial effects can be neglected. As derived previously, the ratio of the inertial term ($I \\sim U^2/L$) to the viscous term ($V \\sim \\nu U / \\delta_T^2$) in the vertical momentum balance scales as:\n$$ \\frac{I}{V} \\sim \\frac{1}{Pr} $$\nTherefore, inertial effects can be neglected when this ratio is much less than one, i.e., $\\frac{1}{Pr} \\ll 1$, which simplifies to the condition $Pr \\gg 1$.

The critical Rayleigh number $Ra_c$ is the minimum of $Ra(m)$ for all allowed integer modes $m \\geq 1$. The function $f(m) = (m^2+1)^3/m^2$ has its minimum for real $m>0$ at $m=1/\\sqrt{2}$. For integers $m \\geq 1$, the function is monotonically increasing, so the minimum occurs at the smallest integer value, $m=1$.\nWe are explicitly asked to evaluate the result for the fundamental mode $m=1$.\n$Ra_c = Ra(1) = \\frac{\\pi^4(1^2+1)^3}{1^2} = 8\\pi^4$\n\nNow we compute the numerical value and round to four significant figures:\n$Ra_c = 8\\pi^4 \\approx 8 \\times (97.409091) \\approx 779.2727$\nRounding to four significant figures gives $Ra_c \\approx 779.3$.\n\nFinally, we address the qualitative comparison. Our calculated critical Rayleigh number for the confined square cavity is $Ra_c \\approx 779.3$. This is substantially lower than the classical value for an infinite horizontal layer with rigid-rigid boundaries, $Ra_{c,\\infty} \\approx 1708$.\n\nThe primary reason for this discrepancy lies in the boundary conditions implicitly imposed by the chosen Galerkin ansatz. The streamfunction $\\psi(x,z,t) = A(t)\\sin(m\\pi x)\\sin(\\pi z)$ results in zero shear stress on all four boundaries of the cavity. For example, on the horizontal boundaries ($z=0,1$), the tangential velocity is $u = -\\partial\\psi/\\partial z = -A(t)\\pi\\sin(m\\pi x)\\cos(\\pi z)$, and the shear stress is proportional to $\\partial u/\\partial z = A(t)\\pi^2\\sin(m\\pi x)\\sin(\\pi z)$, which is zero at $z=0$ and $z=1$. This corresponds to a **free-slip** boundary condition.\n\nThe classical value $Ra_{c,\\infty} \\approx 1708$ is derived for **rigid** (no-slip) horizontal boundaries, where the tangential velocity is zero. No-slip boundaries exert a strong viscous damping effect on the fluid motion, which stabilizes the quiescent conduction state. A much larger thermal driving force (and thus a higher Rayleigh number) is required to overcome this viscous resistance and initiate convection. In contrast, free-slip boundaries offer no such resistance to tangential motion, making the system less stable and leading to a lower critical Rayleigh number.\n\nIndeed, the classical result for an infinite layer with two free-slip boundaries is $Ra_c = \\frac{27}{4}\\pi^4 \\approx 657.5$. Our value of $779.3$ is higher than this, which is physically consistent: the presence of the insulating, free-slip vertical side walls provides an additional stabilizing effect through confinement compared to an infinite layer, thus elevating the threshold for convection. The dominant effect explaining the difference with $1708$, however, is the free-slip versus rigid nature of the horizontal boundaries.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{779.3}\n$$", "id": "2509862"}, {"introduction": "At very high Rayleigh numbers, natural convection becomes fully turbulent, characterized by chaotic fluctuations.

The temperature drop across the bottom boundary layer is $T_h - T_m = \\Delta T/2$, and the drop across the top boundary layer is $T_m - T_c = \\Delta T/2$.\n\nWithin these thin boundary layers, where $\\delta_{T} \\ll H$, heat transfer is dominated by thermal conduction. The mean heat flux $q''$ through the lower (or upper) boundary layer can be modeled using Fourier's law of conduction:\n$$\nq'' \\approx k \\frac{(\\text{temperature difference})}{(\\text{layer thickness})} = k \\frac{\\Delta T/2}{\\delta_{T}}\n$$\nThe definition of the mean Nusselt number is given as:\n$$\n\\overline{Nu} \\equiv \\frac{q'' H}{k \\Delta T}\n$$\nSubstituting our expression for $q''$ into this definition yields the relationship between $\\overline{Nu}$ and $\\delta_{T}$:\n$$\n\\overline{Nu} = \\frac{\\left( k \\frac{\\Delta T}{2 \\delta_{T}} \\right) H}{k \\Delta T} = \\frac{H}{2 \\delta_{T}}\n$$\nThis result shows that the Nusselt number, which represents the enhancement of heat transfer over pure conduction, is inversely proportional to the thickness of the effective conductive sublayers.\n\nNext, we must close this model by finding an expression for $\\delta_{T}$. The problem prescribes a stability criterion based on the local Rayleigh number of the boundary layer, $Ra_{\\delta}$. This criterion posits that the thermal boundary layer grows until it becomes locally unstable and ejects fluid into the core, maintaining a state of marginal stability. The boundary layer Rayleigh number is defined with the boundary layer thickness $\\delta_{T}$ as the length scale and the temperature drop across it, $\\Delta T/2$, as the temperature scale:\n$$\nRa_{\\delta} \\equiv \\frac{g \\beta (\\Delta T/2) \\delta_{T}^{3}}{\\nu \\alpha}\n$$\nThe closure assumption is that $Ra_{\\delta}$ remains at a constant value $c$ of order unity, $Ra_{\\delta} = c$, independent of the global $Ra$ and $Pr$.\n$$\n\\frac{g \\beta (\\Delta T/2) \\delta_{T}^{3}}{\\nu \\alpha} = c\n$$\nWe solve this equation for $\\delta_{T}$:\n$$\n\\delta_{T}^{3} = \\frac{2c \\nu \\alpha}{g \\beta \\Delta T} \\implies \\delta_{T} = \\left( \\frac{2c \\nu \\alpha}{g \\beta \\Delta T} \\right)^{1/3}\n$$\nThis expression indicates how the boundary layer thickness adjusts in response to the fluid properties and the applied temperature difference.\n\nFinally, we combine these two results to derive the scaling law for $\\overline{Nu}$. We substitute the expression for $\\delta_{T}$ into our equation for $\\overline{Nu}$:\n$$\n\\overline{Nu} = \\frac{H}{2 \\delta_{T}} = \\frac{H}{2} \\left( \\frac{g \\beta \\Delta T}{2c \\nu \\alpha} \\right)^{1/3}\n$$\nTo reveal the dependence on the global Rayleigh number, $Ra \\equiv \\frac{g \\beta \\Delta T H^{3}}{\\nu \\alpha}$, we manipulate the expression. We can write $g \\beta \\Delta T = \\frac{Ra \\, \\nu \\alpha}{H^3}$. Substituting this into the equation for $\\overline{Nu}$:\n$$\n\\overline{Nu} = \\frac{H}{2} \\left( \\frac{1}{2c \\nu \\alpha} \\left( \\frac{Ra \\, \\nu \\alpha}{H^3} \\right) \\right)^{1/3} = \\frac{H}{2} \\left( \\frac{Ra}{2c H^3} \\right)^{1/3}\n$$\nSimplifying the expression reveals the final scaling:\n$$\n\\overline{Nu} = \\frac{H}{2} \\frac{Ra^{1/3}}{(2c)^{1/3} (H^3)^{1/3}} = \\frac{H}{2} \\frac{Ra^{1/3}}{(2c)^{1/3} H} = \\frac{1}{2(2c)^{1/3}} Ra^{1/3}\n$$\nThis result has the form $\\overline{Nu} = \\text{constant} \\times Ra^{1/3}$. Comparing this to the target form $\\overline{Nu} \\sim C \\, Ra^{n} Pr^{m}$, we can identify the exponents. The exponent of the Rayleigh number is $n=1/3$. The Prandtl number, $Pr \\equiv \\nu/\\alpha$, does not appear in the final expression because the product $\\nu \\alpha$ in the definition of $Ra_{\\delta}$ cancels with the product $\\nu \\alpha$ from the definition of $Ra$. Therefore, the exponent of the Prandtl number is $m=0$.\nThe derived scaling law is $\\overline{Nu} \\sim C \\, Ra^{1/3} Pr^{0}$. The exponents are thus $n = 1/3$ and $m = 0$.\n\nAs requested, we compare these exponents to those typically observed. The result $n=1/3$ is in excellent agreement with the so-called \"ultimate regime\" of turbulent convection, first predicted by Kraichnan and later by Grossmann and Lohse, and observed in experiments at very high Rayleigh numbers ($Ra \\gtrsim 10^{14}$). In this regime, the boundary layers are thought to become turbulent themselves, and the heat transport becomes independent of the large-scale circulation. The simple model provided in the problem effectively captures the core physics of this regime. The result $m=0$ indicates that, within this model, heat transport is independent of the Prandtl number. Experimentally, for fluids with Prandtl number of order unity ($Pr = \\mathcal{O}(1)$), the dependence of $\\overline{Nu}$ on $Pr$ is known to be very weak. Therefore, $m=0$ is a reasonable first approximation, though more sophisticated theories and precise experiments reveal a small, non-zero exponent for $Pr$. The model's simplicity, particularly its purely thermal stability criterion, is the reason for the null dependence on $Pr$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n\\frac{1}{3}  0\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "2509854"}]}
