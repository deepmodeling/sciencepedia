It contains no contradictions, ambiguities, or factual errors.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem statement is **valid**. A solution will be derived.\n\n### Derivation of Governing Equations and Boundary Conditions\n\nThe derivation starts from the fundamental conservation laws for a Newtonian fluid, incorporating the Boussinesq approximation.\n\n**1. Conservation of Mass (Continuity Equation)**\nThe general continuity equation is $\\frac{\\partial \\rho}{\\partial t} + \\nabla \\cdot (\\rho \\boldsymbol{u}) = 0$. The Boussinesq approximation assumes that density variations are negligible except when they are multiplied by gravity $g$. Thus, for the purpose of mass conservation, the fluid is treated as incompressible with a constant density $\\rho_0$. The continuity equation simplifies to:\n$$ \\nabla \\cdot \\boldsymbol{u} = 0 $$\nIn two-dimensional Cartesian coordinates, this is:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x} + \\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial y} = 0 $$\n\n**2. Conservation of Momentum (Navier-Stokes Equations)**\nThe Navier-Stokes equations for a fluid with constant viscosity $\\mu$ are:\n$$ \\rho \\frac{D\\boldsymbol{u}}{Dt} = -\\nabla P + \\mu \\nabla^2 \\boldsymbol{u} + \\rho \\boldsymbol{g} $$\nwhere $P$ is the thermodynamic pressure and $\\frac{D}{Dt} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t} + \\boldsymbol{u} \\cdot \\nabla$ is the material derivative.\nIn the Boussinesq approximation, the density $\\rho$ in the inertia term (left-hand side) is replaced by the reference density $\\rho_0$. In the gravity term, the full expression for density is used to account for buoyancy.\n$$ \\rho_0 \\frac{D\\boldsymbol{u}}{Dt} = -\\nabla P + \\mu \\nabla^2 \\boldsymbol{u} + \\rho_0 \\left[1 - \\beta\\left(T - T_{\\mathrm{ref}}\\right)\\right] \\boldsymbol{g} $$\nGiven $\\boldsymbol{g} = -g \\hat{\\boldsymbol{j}}$, the gravity term is $\\rho_0 \\left[1 - \\beta\\left(T - T_{\\mathrm{ref}}\\right)\\right](-g \\hat{\\boldsymbol{j}}) = -\\rho_0 g \\hat{\\boldsymbol{j}} + \\rho_0 \\beta g (T - T_{\\mathrm{ref}}) \\hat{\\boldsymbol{j}}$. The equation becomes:\n$$ \\rho_0 \\frac{D\\boldsymbol{u}}{Dt} = -\\nabla P + \\mu \\nabla^2 \\boldsymbol{u} - \\rho_0 g \\hat{\\boldsymbol{j}} + \\rho_0 \\beta g \\left(T - T_{\\mathrm{ref}}\\right) \\hat{\\boldsymbol{j}} $$\nThe problem states that a modified pressure $p$ is used, which absorbs the hydrostatic contribution. The hydrostatic pressure gradient is $\\nabla P_h = \\rho_0 \\boldsymbol{g} = -\\rho_0 g \\hat{\\boldsymbol{j}}$. We define the modified pressure $p$ such that $P = p + P_h$. Then $\\nabla P = \\nabla p + \\nabla P_h = \\nabla p - \\rho_0 g \\hat{\\boldsymbol{j}}$. Substituting this into the momentum equation:\n$$ \\rho_0 \\frac{D\\boldsymbol{u}}{Dt} = -(\\nabla p - \\rho_0 g \\hat{\\boldsymbol{j}}) + \\mu \\nabla^2 \\boldsymbol{u} - \\rho_0 g \\hat{\\boldsymbol{j}} + \\rho_0 \\beta g \\left(T - T_{\\mathrm{ref}}\\right) \\hat{\\boldsymbol{j}} $$\n$$ \\rho_0 \\frac{D\\boldsymbol{u}}{Dt} = -\\nabla p + \\rho_0 g \\hat{\\boldsymbol{j}} + \\mu \\nabla^2 \\boldsymbol{u} - \\rho_0 g \\hat{\\boldsymbol{j}} + \\rho_0 \\beta g \\left(T - T_{\\mathrm{ref}}\\right) \\hat{\\boldsymbol{j}} $$\nThe hydrostatic terms $\\rho_0 g \\hat{\\boldsymbol{j}}$ cancel out, leaving:\n$$ \\rho_0 \\frac{D\\boldsymbol{u}}{Dt} = -\\nabla p + \\mu \\nabla^2 \\boldsymbol{u} + \\rho_0 \\beta g \\left(T - T_{\\mathrm{ref}}\\right) \\hat{\\boldsymbol{j}} $$\nThe term $\\rho_0 \\beta g (T - T_{\\mathrm{ref}}) \\hat{\\boldsymbol{j}}$ is the buoyancy force. Writing this out in $x$ and $y$ components:\n\n$x$-momentum:\n$$ \\rho_0 \\left( \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t} + u \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x} + v \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial y} \\right) = -\\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial x} + \\mu \\left( \\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial x^2} + \\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial y^2} \\right) $$\n\n$y$-momentum:\n$$ \\rho_0 \\left( \\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial t} + u \\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial x} + v \\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial y} \\right) = -\\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial y} + \\mu \\left( \\frac{\\partial^2 v}{\\partial x^2} + \\frac{\\partial^2 v}{\\partial y^2} \\right) + \\rho_0 \\beta g \\left(T - T_{\\mathrm{ref}}\\right) $$\nThe positive sign on the buoyancy term correctly indicates that fluid warmer than the reference ($T  T_{\\mathrm{ref}}$, assuming $\\beta  0$) will experience an upward force.\n\n**3. Conservation of Energy (Temperature Equation)**\nThe energy equation, neglecting viscous dissipation and other source terms, is:\n$$ \\rho c_p \\frac{DT}{Dt} = \\nabla \\cdot (k \\nabla T) $$\nGiven $k$ and $c_p$ are constant, and applying the Boussinesq approximation ($\\rho \\approx \\rho_0$):\n$$ \\rho_0 c_p \\frac{DT}{Dt} = k \\nabla^2 T $$\nDividing by $\\rho_0 c_p$ gives:\n$$ \\frac{DT}{Dt} = \\frac{k}{\\rho_0 c_p} \\nabla^2 T = \\alpha \\nabla^2 T $$\nwhere $\\alpha = k/(\\rho_0 c_p)$ is the thermal diffusivity. In two-dimensional Cartesian coordinates:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial t} + u \\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial x} + v \\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial y} = \\alpha \\left( \\frac{\\partial^2 T}{\\partial x^2} + \\frac{\\partial^2 T}{\\partial y^2} \\right) $$\n\n**4. Boundary Conditions**\n-   **Velocity:** No-slip ($u=0, v=0$) and impermeable (normal velocity is zero) conditions on all solid walls. This means $u=0$ and $v=0$ on $x=0$, $x=L$, $y=0$, and $y=L$.\n-   **Temperature:**\n    -   At $x=0$: a Dirichlet condition, $T=T_h$.\n    -   At $x=L$: a Dirichlet condition, $T=T_c$.\n    -   At $y=0$ and $y=L$: adiabatic walls. Heat flux normal to the wall is zero. Heat flux is given by Fourier's law, $\\boldsymbol{q} = -k \\nabla T$. The normal to the horizontal walls is in the $y$-direction. Thus, $q_y = -k \\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial y} = 0$. Since $k \\neq 0$, this implies a Neumann condition: $\\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial y} = 0$.\n\n### Evaluation of Options\n\n**Option A:**\n-   Continuity equation: $\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x}+\\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial y}=0$. **Correct.**\n-   $x$-momentum equation: $\\rho_0\\left(\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t}+u\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x}+v\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial y}\\right)=-\\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial x}+\\mu\\left(\\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial x^2}+\\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial y^2}\\right)$. **Correct.**\n-   $y$-momentum equation: $\\rho_0\\left(\\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial t}+u\\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial x}+v\\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial y}\\right)=-\\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial y}+\\mu\\left(\\frac{\\partial^2 v}{\\partial x^2}+\\frac{\\partial^2 v}{\\partial y^2}\\right)+\\rho_0\\beta g\\left(T-T_{\\mathrm{ref}}\\right)$. **Correct.**\n-   Energy equation: $\\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial t}+u\\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial x}+v\\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial y}=\\alpha\\left(\\frac{\\partial^2 T}{\\partial x^2}+\\frac{\\partial^2 T}{\\partial y^2}\\right)$ with $\\alpha=\\frac{k}{\\rho_0 c_p}$. **Correct.**\n-   Boundary conditions: $u=0$, $v=0$ on all walls. At $x=0$: $T=T_h$. At $x=L$: $T=T_c$. At $y=0$ and $y=L$: $\\dfrac{\\partial T}{\\partial y}=0$. **Correct.**\nAll equations and boundary conditions in this option match the derivation. It is entirely correct.\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\n**Option B:**\n-   Continuity equation: $\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}\\left(\\rho u\\right)+\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}\\left(\\rho v\\right)=0$. This is the compressible form and is inconsistent with the Boussinesq approximation, which simplifies this to $\\nabla \\cdot \\boldsymbol{u} = 0$. **Incorrect.**\n-   Momentum and Energy equations: These equations use the variable density $\\rho$ in the inertia term and in the denominator of the thermal diffusivity, which is a violation of the Boussinesq approximation. **Incorrect.**\n-   Boundary conditions: The thermal boundary conditions are swapped: vertical walls are specified as adiabatic and horizontal walls have fixed temperatures. This contradicts the problem statement. **Incorrect.**\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**Option C:**\n-   $y$-momentum equation: The buoyancy term $-\\rho_0\\beta g\\left(T-T_{\\mathrm{ref}}\\right)$ has the wrong sign. For most fluids $\\beta0$, so a positive temperature difference $T - T_{\\mathrm{ref}}  0$ should result in an upward (positive) force, not a downward (negative) one. **Incorrect.**\n-   Energy equation: The diffusivity is given as kinematic viscosity $\\nu = \\mu/\\rho_0$ instead of thermal diffusivity $\\alpha=k/(\\rho_0 c_p)$. This is only true if the Prandtl number $Pr = \\nu/\\alpha = 1$, which is not a general condition. This is a fundamental error. **Incorrect.**\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**Option D:**\n-   Continuity equation: $\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x}+\\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial y}=\\beta\\left(\\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial t}+u\\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial x}+v\\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial y}\\right)$. This form is not the standard Boussinesq approximation used in this context, which requires a divergence-free velocity field, $\\nabla \\cdot \\boldsymbol{u} = 0$. **Incorrect.**\n-   $x$-momentum equation: A buoyancy term $\\rho_0\\beta g\\left(T-T_{\\mathrm{ref}}\\right)$ is present. Since gravity acts only in the $y$-direction, there can be no buoyancy force in the $x$-direction. **Incorrect.**\n-   $y$-momentum equation: The term $-\\rho_0 g$ remains, and the temperature-dependent buoyancy term is missing. The formulation is confused, as the modified pressure was intended to remove the hydrostatic components. **Incorrect.**\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\nBased on the rigorous derivation, only Option A presents the correct set of governing equations and boundary conditions for the specified problem.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2491002"}, {"introduction": "Once the governing equations are established, the next step is often to analyze them to understand the underlying physics without seeking a full solution.

The problem is therefore deemed valid and a full solution will be provided.\n\nThe analysis begins with the governing equations for steady, two-dimensional, incompressible flow with a buoyancy term derived from the Boussinesq approximation. The coordinate system is defined with the $x$-axis vertically along the plate and the $y$-axis normal to it. The relevant equations are the conservation of mass and the conservation of momentum in the vertical ($x$) direction.\n\nConservation of mass:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x} + \\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial y} = 0 $$\nConservation of $x$-momentum:\n$$ u \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x} + v \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial y} = \\nu \\left( \\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial x^2} + \\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial y^2} \\right) + g \\beta (T - T_{\\infty}) $$\nHere, $u$ and $v$ are the velocity components in the $x$ and $y$ directions, respectively, $\\nu$ is the kinematic viscosity, $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity, $\\beta$ is the coefficient of thermal expansion, and $T - T_{\\infty}$ is the temperature difference relative to the ambient.\n\nTo non-dimensionalize these equations, we introduce dimensionless variables. The length scales are normalized by the plate height $L$, and the temperature is normalized by the overall temperature difference $\\Delta T = T_s - T_{\\infty}$.\n$$ x^* = \\frac{x}{L}, \\quad y^* = \\frac{y}{L}, \\quad \\theta = \\frac{T - T_{\\infty}}{\\Delta T} $$\nThe velocity components are normalized by a characteristic velocity scale $U_c$, which is to be determined.\n$$ u^* = \\frac{u}{U_c}, \\quad v^* = \\frac{v}{U_c} $$\nSubstituting these variables into the $x$-momentum equation, using the chain rule for derivatives (e.g., $\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^*} \\frac{dx^*}{dx} = \\frac{1}{L} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^*}$), we obtain:\n$$ \\frac{U_c^2}{L} \\left( u^* \\frac{\\partial u^*}{\\partial x^*} + v^* \\frac{\\partial u^*}{\\partial y^*} \\right) = \\frac{\\nu U_c}{L^2} \\left( \\frac{\\partial^2 u^*}{\\partial x^{*2}} + \\frac{\\partial^2 u^*}{\\partial y^{*2}} \\right) + g \\beta \\Delta T \\theta $$\nThe problem asks to select a velocity scale $U_c$ that exposes the ratio of buoyancy to viscous effects.

This is precisely the \"emergent dimensionless group that measures the relative strength of buoyancy to viscous diffusion\" requested by the problem.\n$$ Gr_L = \\frac{g \\beta \\Delta T L^3}{\\nu^2} $$\nWe now compute its numerical value using the provided data: $g=9.81\\,\\mathrm{m/s^2}$, $\\beta \\approx 1/T_{\\infty} = 1/300\\,\\mathrm{K^{-1}}$, $\\Delta T=30\\,\\mathrm{K}$, $L=1\\,\\mathrm{m}$, and $\\nu=1.5\\times 10^{-5}\\,\\mathrm{m^2/s}$.\n$$ Gr_L = \\frac{(9.81\\,\\mathrm{m/s^2}) \\left(\\frac{1}{300}\\,\\mathrm{K^{-1}}\\right) (30\\,\\mathrm{K}) (1\\,\\mathrm{m})^3}{(1.5\\times 10^{-5}\\,\\mathrm{m^2/s})^2} $$\n$$ Gr_L = \\frac{9.81 \\times \\frac{30}{300}}{(1.5)^2 \\times 10^{-10}} = \\frac{9.81 \\times 0.1}{2.25 \\times 10^{-10}} = \\frac{0.981}{2.25 \\times 10^{-10}} \\approx 4.36 \\times 10^9 $$\nThe value of the Grashof number is approximately $4.36 \\times 10^9$.\n\nNext, we must assess the state of the boundary layer at $x=L$. The critical parameter for transition from laminar to turbulent flow in natural convection is the Rayleigh number, $Ra_L$, which is a product of the Grashof and Prandtl numbers: $Ra_L = Gr_L \\cdot Pr$. The Prandtl number, $Pr$, is the ratio of momentum diffusivity to thermal diffusivity, $Pr = \\nu/\\alpha$. Thus, the Rayleigh number, $Ra_L = \\frac{g \\beta \\Delta T L^3}{\\nu \\alpha}$, compares the time scale for thermal transport by buoyancy to the time scale for thermal and momentum diffusion.\nUsing our calculated $Gr_L$ and the given $Pr=0.71$:\n$$ Ra_L = (4.36 \\times 10^9) \\times 0.71 \\approx 3.0956 \\times 10^9 $$\nThe problem states a critical Rayleigh number for transition, $Ra_{L,\\mathrm{crit}} = 1.0 \\times 10^9$. We compare our calculated Rayleigh number at the top of the plate ($x=L$) to this critical value:\n$$ Ra_L \\approx 3.10 \\times 10^9  Ra_{L,\\mathrm{crit}} = 1.0 \\times 10^9 $$\nSince the calculated Rayleigh number exceeds the critical value, the boundary layer flow is expected to be turbulent at the height $x=L$. The flow begins as laminar at the leading edge and undergoes transition to turbulence at a vertical position $x_{\\text{crit}}$ where $Ra_x$ reaches the critical value.\n\nThe final answer should report only the numerical value of the buoyancy-to-viscous dimensionless group, which is the Grashof number $Gr_L$, rounded to three significant figures.\n$Gr_L = 4.36 \\times 10^9$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{4.36 \\times 10^{9}}$$", "id": "2477306"}, {"introduction": "While analytical solutions to the Boussinesq equations are rare, numerical methods provide a powerful pathway to understanding complex natural convection phenomena.

It is a valid problem from the field of computational fluid dynamics. I will proceed with the solution derivation and option analysis.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe fractional-step projection method, in its simplest first-order form (as pioneered by Chorin), splits the time-discretized momentum equation into two conceptual steps. First, we write the semi-discretized momentum equation. Using an explicit Euler scheme for the advective, diffusive, and buoyancy terms for simplicity, as implied by the options, we have:\n$$\n\\rho_0 \\frac{\\boldsymbol{u}^{n+1} - \\boldsymbol{u}^n}{\\Delta t} = - \\nabla p^{n+1} - \\rho_0 \\left( \\boldsymbol{u}^n \\cdot \\nabla \\right) \\boldsymbol{u}^n + \\mu \\nabla^2 \\boldsymbol{u}^n + \\rho_0 g \\beta \\left( T^n - T_{\\mathrm{ref}} \\right) \\hat{\\boldsymbol{g}}\n$$\nThe core idea is to first compute an intermediate velocity field, $\\boldsymbol{u}^\\ast$, by excluding the pressure gradient term, which is responsible for enforcing the incompressibility constraint.\n\n**Step (i): Intermediate Velocity (Predictor Step)**\nWe solve for $\\boldsymbol{u}^\\ast$ by accounting for all explicit forces (advection, diffusion, and buoyancy):\n$$\n\\rho_0 \\frac{\\boldsymbol{u}^\\ast - \\boldsymbol{u}^n}{\\Delta t} = - \\rho_0 \\left( \\boldsymbol{u}^n \\cdot \\nabla \\right) \\boldsymbol{u}^n + \\mu \\nabla^2 \\boldsymbol{u}^n + \\rho_0 g \\beta \\left( T^n - T_{\\mathrm{ref}} \\right) \\hat{\\boldsymbol{g}}\n$$\nThis equation can be rearranged to solve for $\\boldsymbol{u}^\\ast$. This intermediate velocity field $\\boldsymbol{u}^\\ast$ does not generally satisfy the divergence-free condition, i.e., $\\nabla \\cdot \\boldsymbol{u}^\\ast \\neq 0$.\n\n**Step (iii): Velocity Correction (Projection Step)**\nThe relationship between the full time step and the predictor step is established by subtracting the predictor equation from the full semi-discretized equation, which yields:\n$$\n\\rho_0 \\frac{\\boldsymbol{u}^{n+1} - \\boldsymbol{u}^\\ast}{\\Delta t} = - \\nabla p^{n+1}\n$$\nRearranging this gives the velocity correction formula:\n$$\n\\boldsymbol{u}^{n+1} = \\boldsymbol{u}^\\ast - \\frac{\\Delta t}{\\rho_0} \\nabla p^{n+1}\n$$\nThis step \"projects\" the intermediate field $\\boldsymbol{u}^\\ast$ onto the space of divergence-free vector fields to obtain the final velocity $\\boldsymbol{u}^{n+1}$.\n\n**Step (ii): Pressure Poisson Equation and Boundary Conditions**\nTo find the pressure $p^{n+1}$, we enforce the incompressibility constraint on the final velocity: $\\nabla \\cdot \\boldsymbol{u}^{n+1} = 0$. Taking the divergence of the velocity correction equation:\n$$\n\\nabla \\cdot \\boldsymbol{u}^{n+1} = \\nabla \\cdot \\boldsymbol{u}^\\ast - \\nabla \\cdot \\left( \\frac{\\Delta t}{\\rho_0} \\nabla p^{n+1} \\right)\n$$\nSetting $\\nabla \\cdot \\boldsymbol{u}^{n+1} = 0$ and noting that $\\rho_0$ and $\\Delta t$ are constants, we get the Pressure Poisson Equation (PPE):\n$$\n\\nabla^2 p^{n+1} = \\frac{\\rho_0}{\\Delta t} \\nabla \\cdot \\boldsymbol{u}^\\ast\n$$\nThe boundary condition for the pressure is derived from the velocity boundary condition. For an impermeable wall, the normal component of the velocity must be zero: $\\boldsymbol{u}^{n+1} \\cdot \\boldsymbol{n} = 0$, where $\\boldsymbol{n}$ is the unit normal to the boundary. Taking the dot product of the velocity correction equation with $\\boldsymbol{n}$:\n$$\n\\boldsymbol{u}^{n+1} \\cdot \\boldsymbol{n} = \\boldsymbol{u}^\\ast \\cdot \\boldsymbol{n} - \\frac{\\Delta t}{\\rho_0} (\\nabla p^{n+1}) \\cdot \\boldsymbol{n}\n$$\nSetting $\\boldsymbol{u}^{n+1} \\cdot \\boldsymbol{n} = 0$ and recognizing that $(\\nabla p^{n+1}) \\cdot \\boldsymbol{n} = \\frac{\\partial p^{n+1}}{\\partial n}$ (the normal derivative), we obtain the Neumann boundary condition for pressure:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial p^{n+1}}{\\partial n} = \\frac{\\rho_0}{\\Delta t} (\\boldsymbol{u}^\\ast \\cdot \\boldsymbol{n})\n$$\nIf the physical boundary is stationary ($\\boldsymbol{u}_b = 0$), then the condition is $\\boldsymbol{u}^{n+1} \\cdot \\boldsymbol{n} = 0$. If the boundary is moving, the condition is $\\boldsymbol{u}^{n+1} \\cdot \\boldsymbol{n} = \\boldsymbol{u}_b \\cdot \\boldsymbol{n}$. The general form of the pressure boundary condition is therefore $\\frac{\\partial p^{n+1}}{\\partial n} = \\frac{\\rho_0}{\\Delta t} (\\boldsymbol{u}^\\ast \\cdot \\boldsymbol{n} - \\boldsymbol{u}_b \\cdot \\boldsymbol{n})$.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A) Correct**\n-   **(i) Intermediate velocity**: The equation for $\\boldsymbol{u}^\\ast$ correctly includes the advection, diffusion, and buoyancy terms from time level $n$. This matches our derivation.\n-   **(ii) Pressure problem**: The Pressure Poisson Equation $\\nabla^2 p^{n+1} = \\dfrac{\\rho_0}{\\Delta t} \\nabla \\cdot \\boldsymbol{u}^\\ast$ is correct. The Neumann boundary condition $\\dfrac{\\partial p^{n+1}}{\\partial n} = \\dfrac{\\rho_0}{\\Delta t} \\left( \\boldsymbol{u}^\\ast \\cdot \\boldsymbol{n} - \\boldsymbol{u}_b \\cdot \\boldsymbol{n} \\right)$ is also correct, correctly specifying that $\\boldsymbol{u}_b \\cdot \\boldsymbol{n} = 0$ for a stationary impermeable wall. The statement about imposing no-slip on $\\boldsymbol{u}^\\ast$ is a specific implementation choice which, while having known accuracy issues near the boundary, does not invalidate the consistency of the presented set of equations. The equations written are a correct representation of a standard (non-incremental) projection method.\n-   **(iii) Velocity correction**: The correction step $\\boldsymbol{u}^{n+1} = \\boldsymbol{u}^\\ast - \\dfrac{\\Delta t}{\\rho_0} \\nabla p^{n+1}$ is correct.\n-   **Temperature update**: The explicit update for temperature is a valid component of a first-order scheme.\nThis option provides a complete and consistent description of the method.\n\n**B) Incorrect**\n-   **(i) Intermediate velocity**: The equation for $\\boldsymbol{u}^\\ast$ incorrectly omits the buoyancy term $\\rho_0 g \\beta \\left( T^n - T_{\\mathrm{ref}} \\right) \\hat{\\boldsymbol{g}}$. The buoyancy term is a body force and should be included in the predictor step.\n-   **(ii) Pressure problem**: The PPE is modified in an attempt to account for the omitted buoyancy term. This procedure is not standard and, more importantly, the subsequent velocity correction step $\\boldsymbol{u}^{n+1} = \\boldsymbol{u}^\\ast - \\dfrac{\\Delta t}{\\rho_0} \\nabla p^{n+1}$ does not re-introduce the buoyancy term, making the overall scheme inconsistent with the original momentum equation. The scheme fails to correctly account for all forces.\n\n**C) Incorrect**\n-   **(i) Intermediate velocity**: This step is correctly stated.\n-   **(ii) Pressure problem**: The PPE $\\nabla^2 p^{n+1} = - \\dfrac{\\rho_0}{\\Delta t} \\nabla \\cdot \\boldsymbol{u}^\\ast$ has the wrong sign on the right-hand side. The pressure boundary condition also has the wrong sign.\n-   **(iii) Velocity correction**: The correction step $\\boldsymbol{u}^{n+1} = \\boldsymbol{u}^\\ast + \\dfrac{\\Delta t}{\\rho_0} \\nabla p^{n+1}$ has the wrong sign. Physically, a positive pressure gradient must cause deceleration (fluid flows from high to low pressure), so the term must be subtracted. While the equations in this option are internally consistent (the velocity update is consistent with the PPE), they are physically incorrect and do not represent a stable projection method derived from the Navier-Stokes equations.\n\n**D) Incorrect**\n-   **(i) Intermediate velocity**: This step is correctly stated.\n-   **(ii/iii) Pressure problem and correction**: This option proposes a variable-coefficient PPE, $\\nabla \\cdot \\left( \\dfrac{1}{\\rho(T^n)} \\nabla p^{n+1} \\right) = \\dfrac{1}{\\Delta t} \\nabla \\cdot \\boldsymbol{u}^\\ast$, and a corresponding velocity update. This formulation fundamentally contradicts the Boussinesq approximation, which was given as the starting point. The Boussinesq approximation assumes density is constant ($\\rho = \\rho_0$) in all terms *except* the buoyancy term. Introducing a variable density $\\rho(T^n)$ into the inertial term and, by extension, the pressure equation, violates the core principle of this approximation. This would be appropriate for a low-Mach number compressible flow model, but not for a Boussinesq model.\n\nBased on the rigorous derivation, Option A is the only one that correctly and consistently describes a first-order fractional-step projection method for the given Boussinesq equations.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2491010"}]}
