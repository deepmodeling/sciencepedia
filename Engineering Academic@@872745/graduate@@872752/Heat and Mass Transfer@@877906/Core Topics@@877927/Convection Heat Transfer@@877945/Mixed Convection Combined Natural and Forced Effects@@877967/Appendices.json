Since $T_w > T_{\\infty}$ and $C_w > C_{\\infty}$, the thermal contribution $\\beta_{T}(T_w - T_{\\infty})$ is positive (aiding buoyancy), while the solutal contribution $-\\beta_{S}(C_w - C_{\\infty})$ is negative (opposing buoyancy). Our definition $Ri_{eff} = Ri_T - Ri_S$ is positive when the net buoyancy aids the upward flow, satisfying the problem's requirement.\n\nNow, we evaluate this parameter using the given data:\n-   $L = 0.60\\ \\mathrm{m}$\n-   $U_{\\infty} = 0.15\\ \\mathrm{m}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$\n-   $g = 9.81\\ \\mathrm{m}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-2}$\n-   $\\Delta T = T_{w} - T_{\\infty} = 35\\ ^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C} - 20\\ ^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C} = 15\\ \\mathrm{K}$\n-   $\\Delta C = C_{w} - C_{\\infty} = 0.040 - 0.035 = 0.005$\n-   $\\beta_{T} = 2.7 \\times 10^{-4}\\ \\mathrm{K}^{-1}$\n-   $\\beta_{S} = 0.75$\n\nFirst, we determine which buoyancy effect dominates by comparing the magnitudes of the terms inside the bracket of the $Ri_{eff}$ expression.\nThe thermal contribution is:\n$$ \\beta_{T} \\Delta T = (2.7 \\times 10^{-4}\\ \\mathrm{K}^{-1}) \\times (15\\ \\mathrm{K}) = 0.00405 $$\nThe solutal contribution is:\n$$ \\beta_{S} \\Delta C = (0.75) \\times (0.005) = 0.00375 $$\nSince $0.00405 > 0.00375$, the aiding thermal buoyancy is stronger than the opposing solutal buoyancy. Therefore, thermal buoyancy dominates, and the net effect is aiding.\n\nNow, we compute the value of $Ri_{eff}$:\n$$ Ri_{eff} = \\frac{g L}{U_{\\infty}^2} \\left( \\beta_{T} \\Delta T - \\beta_{S} \\Delta C \\right) $$\n$$ Ri_{eff} = \\frac{(9.81\\ \\mathrm{m}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-2})(0.60\\ \\mathrm{m})}{(0.15\\ \\mathrm{m}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1})^2} \\left( 0.00405 - 0.00375 \\right) $$\n$$ Ri_{eff} = \\frac{5.886}{0.0225} \\left( 0.0003 \\right) $$\n$$ Ri_{eff} = 261.6 \\times 0.0003 $$\n$$ Ri_{eff} = 0.07848 $$\nThe result has four significant figures as requested.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{0.07848}\n$$", "id": "2507383"}]}
