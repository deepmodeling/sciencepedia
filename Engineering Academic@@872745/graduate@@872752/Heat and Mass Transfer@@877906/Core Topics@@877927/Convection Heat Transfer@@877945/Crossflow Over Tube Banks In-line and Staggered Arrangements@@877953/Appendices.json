We will proceed from the fundamental definitions as instructed.\n\nFirst, we address the Reynolds number, $Re$. The problem states it is defined as the ratio of inertial to viscous effects. In a fluid flow, inertial forces per unit volume can be characterized by the rate of momentum change, which scales as $\\rho \\frac{V}{t} \\sim \\rho \\frac{V}{L/V} = \\frac{\\rho V^{2}}{L}$, where $\\rho$ is the fluid density, $V$ is a characteristic velocity, and $L$ is a characteristic length scale. Viscous forces per unit volume arise from shear stress gradients and scale as $\\frac{\\mu V/L}{L} = \\frac{\\mu V}{L^{2}}$, where $\\mu$ is the dynamic viscosity of the fluid. The ratio of inertial to viscous forces is therefore:\n$$\nRe = \\frac{\\text{Inertial forces}}{\\text{Viscous forces}} \\sim \\frac{\\rho V^{2}/L}{\\mu V/L^{2}} = \\frac{\\rho V L}{\\mu}\n$$\nThe problem specifies that for transport in tube banks, the characteristic velocity is the maximum gap velocity, $V_{max}$, and the characteristic length is the tube diameter, $D$. Thus, the Reynolds number based on tube diameter, $Re_{D}$, is defined as:\n$$\nRe_{D} = \\frac{\\rho V_{max} D}{\\mu}\n$$\nThe problem provides the following values: $\\rho = 1.18\\ \\mathrm{kg/m^{3}}$, $V_{max} = 5.00\\ \\mathrm{m/s}$, $D = 0.020\\ \\mathrm{m}$, and $\\mu = 1.85 \\times 10^{-5}\\ \\mathrm{Pa \\cdot s}$. Substituting these values into the expression for $Re_{D}$:\n$$\nRe_{D} = \\frac{(1.18\\ \\mathrm{kg/m^{3}}) \\times (5.00\\ \\mathrm{m/s}) \\times (0.020\\ \\mathrm{m})}{1.85 \\times 10^{-5}\\ \\mathrm{Pa \\cdot s}} = \\frac{0.118}{1.85 \\times 10^{-5}} \\approx 6378.378\n$$\nRounding to four significant figures, we get $Re_{D} \\approx 6378$.\n\nNext, we address the Prandtl number, $Pr$.

Momentum diffusivity, also known as the kinematic viscosity, $\\nu$, is defined as the ratio of dynamic viscosity to density:\n$$\n\\nu = \\frac{\\mu}{\\rho}\n$$\nThermal diffusivity, $\\alpha$, is defined as the ratio of thermal conductivity, $k$, to the product of density and specific heat at constant pressure, $\\rho c_{p}$:\n$$\n\\alpha = \\frac{k}{\\rho c_{p}}\n$$\nThe Prandtl number is therefore the ratio of these two quantities:\n$$\nPr = \\frac{\\nu}{\\alpha} = \\frac{\\mu / \\rho}{k / (\\rho c_{p})} = \\frac{\\mu c_{p}}{k}\n$$\nThis expression shows that the Prandtl number is a property of the fluid itself and does not depend on the flow geometry or velocity.

Consider a lumped description at the scale of a row: immediately upstream of each row $i$, the gas has a uniform bulk temperature $T_{b,i}$, and the row removes heat from the gas according to Newton’s law of cooling with a row-averaged external convection coefficient $h_{o}$ and known external area per row $A_{\\text{row}}$.

It presents a standard problem in convective heat transfer that is solvable using fundamental principles. All necessary data are provided, and the assumptions, while simplifying, are physically reasonable for a pedagogical context. The problem is valid.\n\nThe solution proceeds by applying the fundamental principles stated in the problem to a single representative row of the tube bank, deriving a discrete model for the temperature evolution, and then solving this model.\n\nLet us consider a control volume for the gas stream as it passes across row $i$, where $i$ is an index from $0$ to $N_L-1$. The gas enters row $i$ with a bulk temperature $T_{b,i}$ and exits with a bulk temperature $T_{b,i+1}$. The tube surface is maintained at a constant temperature $T_s$.\n\nThe first principle is the steady-state control-volume energy balance for the gas. As the gas is cooled by the tubes, the rate of heat transferred from the gas to the tubes, $\\dot{q}_i$, is given by:\n$$\n\\dot{q}_i = \\dot{m} c_{p} (T_{b,i} - T_{b,i+1})\n$$\nwhere $\\dot{m}$ is the mass flow rate and $c_p$ is the specific heat at constant pressure.\n\nThe second principle is Newton's law of cooling, which describes the heat transfer from the fluid to the tube surface of row $i$. The problem specifies a \"lumped description at the scale of a row\". The most direct interpretation for such a discrete model is to evaluate the heat transfer rate using the temperature at the inlet of the control volume (the row). Thus, the driving temperature difference is based on the bulk temperature upstream of row $i$, which is $T_{b,i}$. The heat transfer rate is then:\n$$\n\\dot{q}_i = h_{o} A_{\\text{row}} (T_{b,i} - T_{s})\n$$\nwhere $h_o$ is the row-averaged external convection coefficient and $A_{\\text{row}}$ is the external surface area of the tubes in one row.\n\nBy equating the two expressions for $\\dot{q}_i$, we establish the relationship between the inlet and outlet temperatures for row $i$:\n$$\n\\dot{m} c_{p} (T_{b,i} - T_{b,i+1}) = h_{o} A_{\\text{row}} (T_{b,i} - T_{s})\n$$\nThe problem requires an analysis in terms of the approach temperature, defined as $\\theta_i \\equiv T_{b,i} - T_s$.
