We can formalize this by analyzing the equation of state. The density $\\rho$ can be expressed as the sum of the reference density $\\rho_{\\infty}$ and a deviation $\\delta\\rho$:\n$$\n\\rho = \\rho_{\\infty} + \\delta\\rho\n$$\nFrom the equation of state, this deviation is:\n$$\n\\delta\\rho = -\\rho_{\\infty}\\beta(T-T_{\\infty})\n$$\nThe relative density variation is therefore:\n$$\n\\frac{\\delta\\rho}{\\rho_{\\infty}} = \\frac{\\rho - \\rho_{\\infty}}{\\rho_{\\infty}} = -\\beta(T-T_{\\infty})\n$$\nThe Boussinesq approximation is valid if the magnitude of this relative density variation is much less than unity throughout the flow domain:\n$$\n\\left|\\frac{\\rho - \\rho_{\\infty}}{\\rho_{\\infty}}\\right| = \\beta|T-T_{\\infty}| \\ll 1\n$$\nThe temperature in the fluid is bounded by the ambient temperature $T_{\\infty}$ and the plate surface temperature $T_s$.

The inertia term is thus approximated as $\\rho_{\\infty}\\frac{D\\mathbf{u}}{Dt}$.\n\nIn the continuity equation, $\\frac{\\partial \\rho}{\\partial t}+\\nabla\\cdot(\\rho \\mathbf{u})=0$, substituting $\\rho = \\rho_{\\infty}(1-\\beta(T-T_\\infty))$ leads to\n$\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t}(\\rho_{\\infty}(1-\\beta(T-T_\\infty))) + \\nabla\\cdot(\\rho_{\\infty}(1-\\beta(T-T_\\infty))\\mathbf{u}) = 0$. After simplification and division by $\\rho_\\infty$, this becomes $-\\beta \\frac{DT}{Dt} + (1-\\beta(T-T_\\infty))\\nabla\\cdot\\mathbf{u}=0$. If $\\beta \\Delta T \\ll 1$, then $1-\\beta(T-T_\\infty) \\approx 1$, and if the term $\\beta \\frac{DT}{Dt}$ is also small, the equation simplifies to the classic incompressible form, $\\nabla\\cdot\\mathbf{u}=0$.\n\nHowever, in the body force term $\\rho\\mathbf{g}$, the same substitution yields $\\rho\\mathbf{g} = (\\rho_{\\infty} + \\delta\\rho)\\mathbf{g} = \\rho_{\\infty}\\mathbf{g} + \\delta\\rho\\mathbf{g}$. The first term, $\\rho_{\\infty}\\mathbf{g}$, represents the hydrostatic weight of the fluid at the reference density. This term is balanced by the hydrostatic pressure gradient, $\\nabla p_h = \\rho_{\\infty}\\mathbf{g}$, where $p=p_h+p_m$. The second term, $\\delta\\rho\\mathbf{g} = -\\rho_{\\infty}\\beta(T-T_{\\infty})\\mathbf{g}$, is the buoyancy force. Although $\\delta\\rho$ is small, this force is what drives the entire convective motion and is therefore of leading order, retained in the momentum balance. The approximation hinges on $\\delta\\rho$ being small compared to $\\rho_{\\infty}$, but $\\delta\\rho\\mathbf{g}$ being comparable to other dynamic terms like inertia and viscous forces.\n\nTherefore, the dimensionless parameter controlling the validity of the Boussinesq approximation is $\\beta \\Delta T$.\n\nThe condition $\\beta |T-T_{\\infty}| \\ll 1$ is most stringent where $|T-T_{\\infty}|$ is largest. In this problem, the fluid temperature ranges from $T_{\\infty}$ to $T_s$. The maximum temperature difference, $\\Delta T = T_s-T_\\infty$, occurs at the surface of the hot plate. Consequently, the relative density deviation $|\\rho-\\rho_\\infty|/\\rho_\\infty = \\beta|T-T_\\infty|$ attains its maximum magnitude, $\\beta \\Delta T$, at the plate surface.\n\nNow, we compute the numerical value of this parameter for the given conditions:\n- Isobaric volumetric thermal expansion coefficient, $\\beta = 2.07 \\times 10^{-4}\\ \\mathrm{K}^{-1}$.\n- Plate-to-ambient temperature difference, $\\Delta T = 20\\ \\mathrm{K}$.\n\nThe dimensionless parameter is:\n$$\n\\beta \\Delta T = (2.07 \\times 10^{-4}\\ \\mathrm{K}^{-1}) \\times (20\\ \\mathrm{K}) = 41.4 \\times 10^{-4} = 4.14 \\times 10^{-3}\n$$\nThe value of the parameter is $0.00414$.\n\nFinally, we interpret this result. The value $\\beta \\Delta T \\approx 0.00414$ represents the maximum fractional change in density relative to the ambient density.

Physically, the unstable stratification encourages the growth of buoyant motions, so heat is transported away more effectively and the wall-normal temperature gradient must increase to sustain the enhanced heat flux.\n\nIn contrast, for the stable orientation $s=-1$, the buoyancy term is of opposite sign: vertical displacements of warmer (lighter) or cooler (heavier) fluid parcels are opposed by gravity (lighter fluid overlies heavier fluid). A near-wall momentum balance of the same form cannot be satisfied with a finite positive $W$ that reinforces vertical motion; rather, vertical motions are strongly damped, and the near-wall transport becomes diffusion dominated. The energy equation then reduces toward a conduction-dominated balance with $W \\ll \\alpha/\\delta$, which can be satisfied only if the effective thermal layer thickens so that the temperature gradient at the wall decreases in magnitude. Consequently, the near-wall $\\theta(y)$ profile in the stable orientation is more gradual (closer to quasi-linear over a relatively thick layer), and the wall-normal gradient at $y=0$ is smaller in magnitude, implying a smaller $Nu_{\\text{local}}$ than in the unstable case at the same $|\\Delta T|$.\n\nMoreover, in the unstable orientation beyond the onset of convection (as quantified by a sufficiently large Rayleigh number $Ra_{L} \\equiv \\dfrac{g \\beta |\\Delta T| L^{3}}{\\nu \\alpha}$ for the geometry), the flow organizes into buoyant plumes and return flows. Where ascending plumes lift warm fluid, $\\theta(y)$ steepens near the wall and $Nu_{\\text{local}}$ attains large values; between plumes, cooling or weak recirculation can flatten $\\theta(y)$, producing smaller local gradients. This leads to spatial nonuniformity of $Nu_{\\text{local}}$ and typically a higher area-averaged Nusselt number compared to the stable orientation, in which motion is suppressed and the field is more conduction-like and uniform with a lower overall heat transfer rate.\n\nEvaluate the options:\n\nA.

The unstable case produces a thinner thermal layer, a steeper near-wall $\\theta(y)$, and thus a larger $Nu_{\\text{local}}$ than the stable case. Correct.\n\nB. This reverses the physical consequence of stability. Suppressing motion does not thin the thermal layer; it reduces advection, thickens the conduction-dominated region, and decreases the wall gradient. Incorrect.\n\nC.

Identical profiles are not expected. Incorrect.\n\nD.

The direction of the gravitational vector $\\mathbf{g}$ relative to the temperature gradient $\\nabla T$ is paramount. We analyze the two specified orientations using scale analysis of the steady-state conservation equations under the Boussinesq approximation. Let $\\delta_T$ be the thickness of the thermal boundary layer. The Nusselt number scales as $Nu_L \\sim L/\\delta_T$. Our goal is to find how $\\delta_T$ depends on the relevant physical parameters, which are encapsulated in $Ra_L$.\n\n**Case (i): Upward-Facing Hot Plate ($T_s  T_{\\infty}$)**\nIn this configuration, the hot, less dense fluid is situated beneath the cold, denser bulk fluid. This arrangement is **hydrodynamically unstable**. Gravity acts to amplify any small perturbation, leading to the rise of warm fluid and the sinking of cool fluid.\n\n-   **High $Ra_L$ Regime (Turbulent or Cellular Convection):**\n    For sufficiently large $Ra_L$, the boundary layer becomes unstable and breaks down into rising plumes and descending sheets of fluid, or a cellular pattern. The heat transfer is dominated by these vigorous convective motions. A key insight into this turbulent regime is that the thermal boundary layer thickness, $\\delta_T$, no longer depends on the overall plate length $L$. Instead, $\\delta_T$ adjusts itself so that the local Rayleigh number based on this thickness, $Ra_{\\delta_T} = g\\,\\beta\\,\\Delta T\\,\\delta_T^{3}/(\\nu\\,\\alpha)$, remains close to a critical constant value, $Ra_c$, at which the sublayer itself is marginally stable.\n    $$Ra_{\\delta_T} \\sim \\text{constant}$$\n    $$ \\frac{g\\,\\beta\\,\\Delta T\\,\\delta_T^{3}}{\\nu\\,\\alpha} \\sim \\text{constant}$$\n    Solving for $\\delta_T$:\n    $$\\delta_T \\sim \\left( \\frac{\\nu\\,\\alpha}{g\\,\\beta\\,\\Delta T} \\right)^{1/3}$$\n    The Nusselt number is then found by substituting this scaling for $\\delta_T$:\n    $$Nu_L \\sim \\frac{L}{\\delta_T} \\sim L \\left( \\frac{g\\,\\beta\\,\\Delta T}{\\nu\\,\\alpha} \\right)^{1/3} = \\left( \\frac{g\\,\\beta\\,\\Delta T\\,L^3}{\\nu\\,\\alpha} \\right)^{1/3}$$\n    Thus, for the unstable, high-$Ra_L$ regime, we recover the scaling:\n    $$Nu_L \\sim Ra_L^{1/3}$$\n\n-   **Low $Ra_L$ Regime (Laminar Convection):**\n    Below the threshold for strong turbulent convection but above the onset of motion, the flow is laminar. The unstable nature of the stratification still promotes vertical motion. The balance of forces in this regime is typically between buoyancy, viscosity, and thermal diffusion. The scaling for a vertical plate, where buoyancy directly drives the flow against viscous drag in a boundary layer, yields $Nu_L \\sim Ra_L^{1/4}$. Given that the flow for the unstable horizontal plate involves significant vertical fluid exchange, it is plausible to expect a scaling behavior similar to that of a vertical plate. Thus, an exponent of $n=1/4$ is a reasonable expectation for this regime.\n\n**Case (ii): Downward-Facing Hot Plate ($T_s  T_{\\infty}$)**\nIn this configuration, the hot, less dense fluid is situated above the cold, denser bulk fluid. This arrangement is **hydrodynamically stable**. Buoyancy acts to suppress vertical motion and stratify the fluid.\n\n-   **Flow Regime:**\n    The stable stratification prevents the formation of plumes and turbulent breakdown. Convection is not completely absent; the heated fluid layer spreads horizontally outwards from the center towards the edges of the plate, driven by the horizontal pressure gradient induced by buoyancy. This results in a weak, persistent laminar boundary layer over a very wide range of $Ra_L$. The dominant balance is between the pressure gradient, viscous forces, and thermal diffusion. A scale analysis for this situation proceeds as follows:\n    1.  The vertical pressure gradient balances buoyancy: $\\partial p'/\\partial y \\sim \\rho g \\beta \\Delta T$. Across the boundary layer, $p' \\sim \\rho g \\beta \\Delta T \\delta_T$.\n    2.  This creates a horizontal pressure gradient driving the flow: $\\partial p'/\\partial x \\sim p'/L \\sim \\rho g \\beta \\Delta T \\delta_T/L$.\n    3.  This pressure gradient is balanced by viscous shear: $(1/\\rho)\\partial p'/\\partial x \\sim \\nu U/\\delta_T^2$. This yields $U \\sim g \\beta \\Delta T \\delta_T^3 / (\\nu L)$.\n    4.  The energy equation balances horizontal advection with vertical diffusion: $U \\Delta T/L \\sim \\alpha \\Delta T/\\delta_T^2$. This yields $U \\sim \\alpha L/\\delta_T^2$.\n    5.  Equating the two expressions for the characteristic velocity $U$:\n        $$\\frac{g \\beta \\Delta T \\delta_T^3}{\\nu L} \\sim \\frac{\\alpha L}{\\delta_T^2} \\implies \\delta_T^5 \\sim \\frac{\\nu \\alpha L^2}{g \\beta \\Delta T}$$\n    6.  Expressing this in terms of $Ra_L$:\n        $$\\left(\\frac{\\delta_T}{L}\\right)^5 \\sim \\frac{\\nu \\alpha}{g \\beta \\Delta T L^3} = Ra_L^{-1}$$\n        $$\\frac{\\delta_T}{L} \\sim Ra_L^{-1/5}$$\n    7.  Finally, the Nusselt number scaling is:\n        $$Nu_L \\sim \\frac{L}{\\delta_T} \\sim Ra_L^{1/5}$$\n    This exponent $n=1/5$ is smaller than both $n=1/4$ and $n=1/3$, reflecting the less effective heat transfer in the stable configuration.\n\n**Evaluation of Options**\n\n-   **Option A:** This option states that upward-facing plates are unstable, leading to plumes/cells and $Nu \\sim Ra_L^{1/3}$ at high $Ra_L$ due to marginal stability of the sublayer, and a laminar regime with $Nu \\sim Ra_L^{1/4}$ at lower $Ra_L$. It also states that downward-facing plates are stable, resulting in a persistent weak laminar layer with a smaller exponent, like $n \\approx 1/5$. This aligns perfectly with the first-principles derivation. The physical reasoning is sound, and the predicted scaling exponents are correct for their respective regimes. **Correct**.\n\n-   **Option B:** This option claims the exponent $n$ must be identical for both orientations because gravity is only present in $Ra_L$. This is fundamentally incorrect. The orientation of the plate relative to the gravity vector determines the stability of the density stratification. It is precisely the directionality of the buoyancy force that causes the profound physical difference between the two cases. **Incorrect**.\n\n-   **Option C:** This option claims for the upward-facing case that $n \\approx 1$ because buoyancy eliminates the need for diffusion, and for the downward-facing case that $n \\approx 0$ because convection is completely suppressed. Both claims are physically baseless. Diffusion is always necessary at the wall to transfer heat to the fluid, so $n=1$ has no physical origin. Convection in the stable case is weakened, not eliminated, so $Nu$ is not constant ($n \\neq 0$) for $Ra_L  0$. **Incorrect**.\n\n-   **Option D:** This option incorrectly attributes the difference in $n$ to the plate's thermal conductivity and claims $n \\approx 1/2$ for a perfectly conducting (isothermal) plate in both cases. An isothermal plate is assumed in the problem, so this cannot be the explanation. The primary cause is fluid dynamic stability, not conjugate heat transfer. The exponent $n=1/2$ is not correct for this problem, and the claim that orientation would not matter for an ideal plate is false. **Incorrect**.\n\nBased on a rigorous analysis, Option A provides the only physically consistent and comprehensive explanation for the observed phenomena.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2510711"}]}
