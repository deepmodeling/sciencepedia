It is a well-posed, scientifically grounded problem in heat conduction that is self-contained and free of contradiction or ambiguity. We shall proceed with the derivation.\n\nThe analysis is based on the following explicit assumptions, as given in the problem statement:\n$1$. The system is at steady state, meaning all properties, including temperature, are time-invariant. Therefore, $\\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial t} = 0$.\n$2$. The temperature field is one-dimensional and depends only on the radial coordinate $r$. This is due to the spherical symmetry of the geometry and boundary conditions.\n$3$. The material is homogeneous and isotropic, which means the thermal conductivity $k$ is a constant, independent of position and direction.\n$4$. The volumetric heat generation rate $\\dot{q}$ is uniform throughout the sphere.\n\nWe begin by applying the principle of conservation of energy to a differential spherical shell control volume of inner radius $r$ and outer radius $r + dr$. The energy balance for a steady-state system is:\n$$E_{in} - E_{out} + E_{gen} = E_{stored}$$\nGiven steady state, the storage term $E_{stored}$ is zero. The energy terms are:\n- Rate of heat conducted into the control volume at radius $r$: $q_{r}(r)$\n- Rate of heat conducted out of the control volume at radius $r+dr$: $q_{r}(r+dr)$\n- Rate of heat generated within the control volume: $\\dot{q} \\cdot dV$, where $dV$ is the volume of the shell.\n\nThe volume of the differential shell is the difference between the volume of a sphere of radius $r+dr$ and a sphere of radius $r$:\n$$dV = \\frac{4}{3}\\pi(r+dr)^3 - \\frac{4}{3}\\pi r^3 = \\frac{4}{3}\\pi(r^3 + 3r^2dr + 3r(dr)^2 + (dr)^3 - r^3)$$\nIgnoring higher-order terms in an infinitesimal analysis (terms with $(dr)^2$ and $(dr)^3$), the volume is $dV \\approx 4\\pi r^2 dr$.\n\nThe steady energy balance is thus:\n$$q_{r}(r) - q_{r}(r+dr) + \\dot{q} (4\\pi r^2 dr) = 0$$\nRearranging this equation, we get:\n$$q_{r}(r+dr) - q_{r}(r) = 4\\pi \\dot{q} r^2 dr$$\nDividing by $dr$ yields:\n$$\\frac{q_{r}(r+dr) - q_{r}(r)}{dr} = 4\\pi \\dot{q} r^2$$\nIn the limit as $dr \\to 0$, the left side becomes the derivative of $q_r$ with respect to $r$:\n$$\\frac{dq_r}{dr} = 4\\pi \\dot{q} r^2$$\nNext, we invoke Fourier's law of heat conduction, which relates the heat rate $q_r$ to the temperature gradient $\\frac{dT}{dr}$. For a spherical surface area $A(r) = 4\\pi r^2$:\n$$q_r(r) = -k A(r) \\frac{dT}{dr} = -k (4\\pi r^2) \\frac{dT}{dr}$$\nSubstituting this expression for $q_r(r)$ into the energy balance derivative:\n$$\\frac{d}{dr} \\left( -k (4\\pi r^2) \\frac{dT}{dr} \\right) = 4\\pi \\dot{q} r^2$$\nSince $k$ is a constant, we can simplify and cancel the $4\\pi$ factor:\n$$-k \\frac{d}{dr} \\left( r^2 \\frac{dT}{dr} \\right) = \\dot{q} r^2$$\nThis gives the governing second-order ordinary differential equation for the temperature profile $T(r)$:\n$$\\frac{d}{dr} \\left( r^2 \\frac{dT}{dr} \\right) = -\\frac{\\dot{q}}{k} r^2$$\nTo solve for $T(r)$, we integrate this equation twice. First integration with respect to $r$:\n$$r^2 \\frac{dT}{dr} = -\\int \\frac{\\dot{q}}{k} r^2 dr = -\\frac{\\dot{q} r^3}{3k} + C_1$$\nwhere $C_1$ is the first integration constant. To find the temperature gradient, we divide by $r^2$:\n$$\\frac{dT}{dr} = -\\frac{\\dot{q} r}{3k} + \\frac{C_1}{r^2}$$\nSecond integration with respect to $r$:\n$$T(r) = \\int \\left( -\\frac{\\dot{q} r}{3k} + \\frac{C_1}{r^2} \\right) dr = -\\frac{\\dot{q} r^2}{6k} - \\frac{C_1}{r} + C_2$$\nwhere $C_2$ is the second integration constant.\n\nWe must now determine the constants $C_1$ and $C_2$ using two boundary conditions.\nThe first condition is the physical requirement of temperature regularity at the center of the sphere ($r=0$). The temperature must be finite at $r=0$. Inspecting the term $-\\frac{C_1}{r}$ in the solution for $T(r)$, it is clear that this term will approach infinity as $r \\to 0$ unless $C_1=0$. Therefore, for a physically realistic, finite temperature at the center, we must impose the condition $C_1=0$. This is the regularity condition. An equivalent justification is that due to spherical symmetry, the heat flux at the center must be zero. The temperature gradient $\\frac{dT}{dr}$ must therefore be zero at $r=0$. The expression $\\frac{dT}{dr} = -\\frac{\\dot{q} r}{3k} + \\frac{C_1}{r^2}$ is zero at $r=0$ only if $C_1=0$.\nWith $C_1=0$, the solution simplifies to:\n$$T(r) = -\\frac{\\dot{q} r^2}{6k} + C_2$$\n\nThe second condition is the convective boundary condition at the surface of the sphere, $r=R$:\n$$-k \\frac{dT}{dr}\\bigg|_{r=R} = h \\left( T(R) - T_{\\infty} \\right)$$\nFirst, we evaluate the derivative of our simplified temperature profile at $r=R$:\n$$\\frac{dT}{dr} = -\\frac{\\dot{q} r}{3k} \\implies \\frac{dT}{dr}\\bigg|_{r=R} = -\\frac{\\dot{q} R}{3k}$$\nSubstituting this into the boundary condition equation gives:\n$$-k \\left( -\\frac{\\dot{q} R}{3k} \\right) = h \\left( T(R) - T_{\\infty} \\right)$$\n$$\\frac{\\dot{q} R}{3} = h \\left( T(R) - T_{\\infty} \\right)$$\nNow we express $T(R)$ using our solution form:\n$$T(R) = -\\frac{\\dot{q} R^2}{6k} + C_2$$\nSubstitute this into the boundary condition relation:\n$$\\frac{\\dot{q} R}{3h} = \\left( -\\frac{\\dot{q} R^2}{6k} + C_2 \\right) - T_{\\infty}$$\nNow we solve for the constant $C_2$:\n$$C_2 = T_{\\infty} + \\frac{\\dot{q} R}{3h} + \\frac{\\dot{q} R^2}{6k}$$\nFinally, we substitute the determined constants $C_1=0$ and $C_2$ back into the general solution for $T(r)$:\n$$T(r) = -\\frac{\\dot{q} r^2}{6k} + \\left( T_{\\infty} + \\frac{\\dot{q} R}{3h} + \\frac{\\dot{q} R^2}{6k} \\right)$$\nRearranging the terms yields the final expression for the radial temperature profile:\n$$T(r) = T_{\\infty} + \\frac{\\dot{q} R^2}{6k} - \\frac{\\dot{q} r^2}{6k} + \\frac{\\dot{q} R}{3h}$$\nThis can be written more compactly as:\n$$T(r) = T_{\\infty} + \\frac{\\dot{q}}{6k}(R^2 - r^2) + \\frac{\\dot{q} R}{3h}$$\nThis is the complete, closed-form solution for the temperature distribution within the sphere as a function of the radial coordinate $r$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{T_{\\infty} + \\frac{\\dot{q}(R^2 - r^2)}{6k} + \\frac{\\dot{q}R}{3h}}\n$$", "id": "2490687"}, {"introduction": "Real materials often exhibit temperature-dependent properties, which turns the heat diffusion equation into a more challenging nonlinear partial differential equation.

It contains no scientific flaws, ambiguities, or contradictions.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. A complete solution will be provided.\n\nThe solution proceeds by addressing each part of the problem in sequence.\n\nFirst, we address part (a). The local conservation of energy for a fixed, arbitrary control volume $V$ with boundary surface $S$ is expressed as:\n$$\n\\frac{d}{dt} \\int_V \\rho c T \\, dV = - \\oint_S \\boldsymbol{q} \\cdot \\boldsymbol{n} \\, dS + \\int_V \\dot{q} \\, dV\n$$\nHere, $\\boldsymbol{q}$ is the heat flux vector and $\\boldsymbol{n}$ is the outward unit normal to $S$. Since $\\rho$ and $c$ are constant and the volume $V$ is fixed, the time derivative can be moved inside the integral. Applying the divergence theorem to the surface integral, $\\oint_S \\boldsymbol{q} \\cdot \\boldsymbol{n} \\, dS = \\int_V (\\nabla \\cdot \\boldsymbol{q}) \\, dV$, we obtain:\n$$\n\\int_V \\left( \\rho c \\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial t} + \\nabla \\cdot \\boldsymbol{q} - \\dot{q} \\right) dV = 0\n$$\nAs this equation must hold for any arbitrary volume $V$, the integrand must be identically zero. This gives the differential form of the energy conservation equation:\n$$\n\\rho c \\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial t} = - \\nabla \\cdot \\boldsymbol{q} + \\dot{q}\n$$\nSubstituting Fourier's law of conduction, $\\boldsymbol{q} = -k(T)\\nabla T$, yields the general heat diffusion equation for a material with temperature-dependent thermal conductivity:\n$$\n\\rho c \\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial t} = \\nabla \\cdot \\left( k(T)\\nabla T \\right) + \\dot{q}\n$$\nThis is the general equation in Cartesian coordinates, where $\\nabla = \\hat{\\boldsymbol{i}}\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} + \\hat{\\boldsymbol{j}}\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y} + \\hat{\\boldsymbol{k}}\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z}$.\n\nWe now specialize this equation for the required geometries:\n- For one-dimensional Cartesian conduction, $T=T(x,t)$, the equation simplifies to:\n$$\n\\rho c \\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial t} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} \\left( k(T) \\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial x} \\right) + \\dot{q}\n$$\n- For axisymmetric, purely radial conduction in cylindrical coordinates, $T=T(r,t)$, the divergence operator on the radial heat flux $\\boldsymbol{q} = -k(T)\\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial r}\\hat{\\boldsymbol{r}}$ is $\\nabla \\cdot \\boldsymbol{q} = \\frac{1}{r}\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial r}(r q_r)$. The equation becomes:\n$$\n\\rho c \\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial t} = \\frac{1}{r} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial r} \\left( r k(T) \\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial r} \\right) + \\dot{q}\n$$\n- For spherically symmetric, purely radial conduction, $T=T(r,t)$, the divergence operator on the radial heat flux is $\\nabla \\cdot \\boldsymbol{q} = \\frac{1}{r^2}\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial r}(r^2 q_r)$.

The Kirchhoff transformation is defined as $w(T) = \\int^{T} k(\\xi)\\,\\mathrm{d}\\xi$. By the chain rule, the gradient of $w$ is $\\nabla w = \\frac{dw}{dT} \\nabla T$. From the definition of $w$ and the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, $\\frac{dw}{dT} = k(T)$. Thus, we have the relation $\\nabla w = k(T) \\nabla T$.\nThe spatial conduction operator from part (a) is $\\nabla \\cdot (k(T)\\nabla T)$. Substituting the relation for $\\nabla w$, we get:\n$$\n\\nabla \\cdot (k(T)\\nabla T) = \\nabla \\cdot (\\nabla w) = \\nabla^2 w\n$$\nThe heat equation becomes $\\rho c \\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial t} = \\nabla^2 w + \\dot{q}$. Under steady-state conditions ($\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t}=0$) and with no internal heat generation ($\\dot{q}=0$), this equation simplifies to:\n$$\n\\nabla^2 w = 0\n$$\nThis is Laplace's equation, which is a linear partial differential equation for the variable $w$. The transformation has successfully linearized the steady-state conduction problem.\n\nFor the given thermal conductivity, $k(T)=k_0(1+\\beta T)$, we compute $w(T)$ explicitly. Choosing the lower limit of integration as $0$ for convenience yields:\n$$\nw(T) = \\int_0^T k_0(1+\\beta\\xi)\\,\\mathrm{d}\\xi = k_0 \\left[ \\xi + \\frac{\\beta}{2}\\xi^2 \\right]_0^T = k_0\\left(T + \\frac{\\beta}{2}T^2\\right)\n$$\n\nFinally, we address part (c). We solve for steady, spherically symmetric heat conduction in a hollow sphere with no heat generation. From part (b), the governing equation for the Kirchhoff variable $w(r)$ is $\\nabla^2 w = 0$. In spherical coordinates with only radial dependence, this is:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{r^2} \\frac{d}{dr}\\left(r^2 \\frac{dw}{dr}\\right) = 0\n$$\nIntegrating twice with respect to $r$ gives the general solution:\n$$\nw(r) = -\\frac{C_1}{r} + C_2\n$$\nwhere $C_1$ and $C_2$ are integration constants. The boundary conditions are $T(a)=T_a$ and $T(b)=T_b$. We transform these into conditions on $w$: $w(a)=w_a$ and $w(b)=w_b$.\nApplying these conditions:\n$$\nw_a = -\\frac{C_1}{a} + C_2\n$$\n$$\nw_b = -\\frac{C_1}{b} + C_2\n$$\nSolving this system for $C_1$ and $C_2$ and substituting back into the general solution for $w(r)$ yields the solution in several equivalent forms. A convenient form, expressing $w(r)$ as a linear interpolation of $w_a$ and $w_b$ in the $1/r$ coordinate, is:\n$$\nw(r) = \\frac{w_a(1/r - 1/b) + w_b(1/a - 1/r)}{1/a - 1/b} = \\frac{w_a a(b-r) + w_b b(r-a)}{r(b-a)}\n$$\nTo find $T(r)$, we must invert the Kirchhoff transformation. From $w = k_0(T + \\frac{\\beta}{2}T^2)$, we solve for $T$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\beta}{2} T^2 + T - \\frac{w}{k_0} = 0\n$$\nThis quadratic equation has the solutions:\n$$\nT = \\frac{-1 \\pm \\sqrt{1 - 4(\\beta/2)(-w/k_0)}}{\\beta} = \\frac{-1 \\pm \\sqrt{1 + 2\\beta w/k_0}}{\\beta}\n$$\nThe positive root must be chosen to ensure that $T \\to w/k_0$ in the limit $\\beta \\to 0$ (the constant conductivity case) and to yield physically meaningful positive absolute temperatures. Thus:\n$$\nT(r) = \\frac{1}{\\beta}\\left(-1 + \\sqrt{1 + \\frac{2\\beta w(r)}{k_0}}\\right)\n$$\nA crucial simplification arises by noting that $1 + \\frac{2\\beta w(T)}{k_0} = 1 + 2\\beta(T + \\frac{\\beta}{2}T^2) = 1 + 2\\beta T + \\beta^2 T^2 = (1+\\beta T)^2$.\nThen, $(1+\\beta T(r))^2 = 1 + \\frac{2\\beta w(r)}{k_0}$. Since $w(r)$ is a linear combination of $w_a$ and $w_b$, $(1+\\beta T(r))^2$ will be the same linear combination of $(1+\\beta T_a)^2$ and $(1+\\beta T_b)^2$. Using the derived expression for $w(r)$:\n$$\n(1+\\beta T(r))^2 = \\frac{a(b-r)(1+\\beta T_a)^2 + b(r-a)(1+\\beta T_b)^2}{r(b-a)}\n$$\nTaking the square root (positive root, since $k(T)>0$ implies $1+\\beta T>0$) and solving for $T(r)$ gives the final expression for the temperature profile:\n$$\nT(r) = \\frac{1}{\\beta} \\left( -1 + \\sqrt{\\frac{a(b-r)(1+\\beta T_a)^2 + b(r-a)(1+\\beta T_b)^2}{r(b-a)}} \\right)\n$$\nThis is the closed-form analytical solution for the temperature field in the hollow sphere.", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{ \\frac{1}{\\beta} \\left( -1 + \\sqrt{\\frac{a(b-r)(1+\\beta T_a)^{2} + b(r-a)(1+\\beta T_b)^{2}}{r(b-a)}} \\right) } $$", "id": "2490692"}, {"introduction": "We now shift our focus from steady-state to transient, or time-dependent, heat conduction.

The temporal part is:\n$$\n\\frac{d\\mathcal{T}}{dt} = -\\alpha \\lambda^2 \\mathcal{T} \\implies \\mathcal{T}(t) = C_0 \\exp(-\\alpha \\lambda^2 t)\n$$\nThe spatial part is the Helmholtz equation:\n$$\n\\nabla^2 S + \\lambda^2 S = 0\n$$\nWe further separate the spatial function $S(r, \\theta, \\phi)$ into a radial part and an angular part:\n$$\nS(r, \\theta, \\phi) = \\mathcal{R}(r) Y(\\theta, \\phi)\n$$\nSubstituting this into the Helmholtz equation written in spherical coordinates:\n$$\n\\frac{Y}{r^2} \\frac{d}{dr} \\left( r^2 \\frac{d\\mathcal{R}}{dr} \\right) + \\frac{\\mathcal{R}}{r^2 \\sin\\theta} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\theta} \\left( \\sin\\theta \\frac{\\partial Y}{\\partial \\theta} \\right) + \\frac{\\mathcal{R}}{r^2 \\sin^2\\theta} \\frac{\\partial^2 Y}{\\partial \\phi^2} + \\lambda^2 \\mathcal{R}Y = 0\n$$\nMultiplying by $\\frac{r^2}{\\mathcal{R}Y}$ allows for separation of the radial and angular variables:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{\\mathcal{R}} \\frac{d}{dr} \\left( r^2 \\frac{d\\mathcal{R}}{dr} \\right) + \\lambda^2 r^2 = -\\frac{1}{Y} \\left[ \\frac{1}{\\sin\\theta} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\theta} \\left( \\sin\\theta \\frac{\\partial Y}{\\partial \\theta} \\right) + \\frac{1}{\\sin^2\\theta} \\frac{\\partial^2 Y}{\\partial \\phi^2} \\right]\n$$\nThe left side depends only on $r$ and the right side only on $(\\theta, \\phi)$. Both must equal a constant, which from the theory of spherical harmonics is known to be $\\ell(\\ell+1)$ for a non-negative integer $\\ell$. The angular function $Y(\\theta, \\phi)$ corresponds to the spherical harmonics $Y_{\\ell}^{m}(\\theta, \\phi)$.\n\nThe radial equation becomes:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{\\mathcal{R}} \\frac{d}{dr} \\left( r^2 \\frac{d\\mathcal{R}}{dr} \\right) + \\lambda^2 r^2 = \\ell(\\ell+1)\n$$\nRearranging gives the ordinary differential equation for the radial part $\\mathcal{R}(r)$:\n$$\nr^2 \\frac{d^2\\mathcal{R}}{dr^2} + 2r \\frac{d\\mathcal{R}}{dr} + (\\lambda^2 r^2 - \\ell(\\ell+1))\\mathcal{R} = 0\n$$\nThis is the spherical Bessel differential equation. Its general solution is a linear combination of the spherical Bessel function of the first kind, $j_{\\ell}(\\lambda r)$, and the spherical Bessel function of the second kind, $y_{\\ell}(\\lambda r)$:\n$$\n\\mathcal{R}(r) = C_1 j_{\\ell}(\\lambda r) + C_2 y_{\\ell}(\\lambda r)\n$$\nWe must now apply the boundary conditions to determine the constants and the admissible eigenvalues $\\lambda$.\nThe first condition is the finiteness (regularity) of the temperature at the center of the sphere, $r=0$. The behavior of the spherical Bessel functions for small argument $x \\to 0$ is:\n$$\nj_{\\ell}(x) \\sim \\frac{x^\\ell}{(2\\ell+1)!!} \\quad (\\text{finite at } x=0)\n$$\n$$\ny_{\\ell}(x) \\sim -\\frac{(2\\ell-1)!!}{x^{\\ell+1}} \\quad (\\text{singular at } x=0)\n$$\nFor the solution $\\mathcal{R}(r)$ to remain finite as $r \\to 0$, the coefficient of the singular function $y_{\\ell}(\\lambda r)$ must be zero. Therefore, $C_2 = 0$. The radial solution is thus of the form:\n$$\n\\mathcal{R}(r) = C_1 j_{\\ell}(\\lambda r)\n$$\nThe second boundary condition is that the temperature is held at zero at the surface $r=R$, for all times $t>0$. This is a Dirichlet boundary condition: $T(R, \\theta, \\phi, t) = 0$. Since this must hold for any angular variation and time, the radial part of the solution must be zero at $r=R$:\n$$\n\\mathcal{R}(R) = 0\n$$\nSubstituting this into the radial solution, for a non-trivial solution ($C_1 \\neq 0$), we must have:\n$$\nj_{\\ell}(\\lambda R) = 0\n$$\nThis equation is the eigenvalue condition. It dictates that the product $\\lambda R$ must be a zero of the spherical Bessel function of the first kind of order $\\ell$. Let the positive zeros of $j_{\\ell}(z)$ be denoted by $z_{\\ell,n}$ for $n=1, 2, 3, \\ldots$. Then the allowed values for the separation constant $\\lambda$, i.e., the eigenvalues, are:\n$$\n\\lambda_{\\ell,n} R = z_{\\ell,n} \\implies \\lambda_{\\ell,n} = \\frac{z_{\\ell,n}}{R}\n$$\nFor each eigenvalue $\\lambda_{\\ell,n}$, there is a corresponding radial eigenfunction, found by substituting the eigenvalue back into the solution for $\\mathcal{R}(r)$. We can set the arbitrary constant $C_1=1$, as the eigenfunctions are determined up to a multiplicative constant. The radial eigenfunctions are:\n$$\n\\mathcal{R}_{\\ell,n}(r) = j_{\\ell}(\\lambda_{\\ell,n} r) = j_{\\ell}\\left(\\frac{z_{\\ell,n}}{R}r\\right)\n$$\nThe set of these functions for $n=1, 2, 3, \\ldots$ forms a complete orthogonal set on the interval $[0, R]$ with respect to the weight function $r^2$.\n\nIn summary, the radial eigenfunctions are the spherical Bessel functions of the first kind, evaluated at arguments determined by the eigenvalues. The eigenvalues themselves are determined by the boundary condition at $r=R$, which requires them to be proportional to the zeros of the same spherical Bessel functions.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n\\mathcal{R}_{\\ell,n}(r) = j_{\\ell}(\\lambda_{\\ell,n}r) & j_{\\ell}(\\lambda_{\\ell,n}R) = 0\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "2490670"}]}
