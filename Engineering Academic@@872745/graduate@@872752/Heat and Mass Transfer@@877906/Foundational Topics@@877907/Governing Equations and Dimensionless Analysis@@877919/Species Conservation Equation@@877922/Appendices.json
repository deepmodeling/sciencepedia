We proceed with the solution.\n\nThe derivation consists of three main parts as requested: first, the derivation of the local molar species conservation equation; second, its conversion to the mass-fraction form; and finally, the determination of the mass production rate for species $C$.\n\nFirst, we derive the local molar species conservation equation. The integral balance for the number of moles of species $i$ in an arbitrary, fixed control volume $V$ bounded by a surface $A$ is given by:\n$$ \\frac{d}{dt} \\int_V c_i \\, dV = - \\oint_A \\mathbf{N}_i \\cdot \\mathbf{n} \\, dA + \\int_V \\dot{R}_i \\, dV $$\nHere, $c_i$ is the molar concentration of species $i$, $\\mathbf{N}_i$ is the absolute molar flux, $\\mathbf{n}$ is the outward-pointing unit normal vector on the surface $A$, and $\\dot{R}_i$ is the net molar rate of production of species $i$ per unit volume due to chemical reaction.\n\nFor a fixed control volume, the time derivative can be moved inside the integral. Applying the Gauss divergence theorem to the surface integral transforms it into a volume integral:\n$$ \\oint_A \\mathbf{N}_i \\cdot \\mathbf{n} \\, dA = \\int_V \\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{N}_i \\, dV $$\nSubstituting these into the integral balance gives:\n$$ \\int_V \\frac{\\partial c_i}{\\partial t} \\, dV = - \\int_V \\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{N}_i \\, dV + \\int_V \\dot{R}_i \\, dV $$\nThis can be rearranged into a single volume integral:\n$$ \\int_V \\left( \\frac{\\partial c_i}{\\partial t} + \\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{N}_i - \\dot{R}_i \\right) \\, dV = 0 $$\nSince this equation must hold for any arbitrary control volume $V$, the integrand itself must be zero. This yields the local, differential form of the molar species conservation equation:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial c_i}{\\partial t} + \\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{N}_i = \\dot{R}_i $$\nThe absolute molar flux $\\mathbf{N}_i$ is the sum of the convective flux due to the bulk motion and the diffusive flux relative to that motion. The problem specifies the mass-averaged velocity $\\mathbf{u}$ as the reference for bulk motion. Thus, the absolute molar flux is decomposed as:\n$$ \\mathbf{N}_i = c_i \\mathbf{u} + \\mathbf{J}_i $$\nwhere $c_i \\mathbf{u}$ is the molar convective flux and $\\mathbf{J}_i$ is the molar diffusive flux of species $i$ relative to $\\mathbf{u}$. Substituting this decomposition into the conservation equation gives:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial c_i}{\\partial t} + \\nabla \\cdot (c_i \\mathbf{u} + \\mathbf{J}_i) = \\dot{R}_i $$\nThis expands to:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial c_i}{\\partial t} + \\nabla \\cdot (c_i \\mathbf{u}) + \\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{J}_i = \\dot{R}_i $$\nThis is the general local molar species conservation equation.\n\nNext, we identify the reaction source term $\\dot{R}_i$. For a general elementary reaction, the molar production rate of species $i$ is $\\dot{R}_i = \\nu_i R$, where $\\nu_i$ is the net stoichiometric coefficient of species $i$ ($\\nu_i = \\nu_i'' - \\nu_i'$, where $\\nu_i'$ and $\\nu_i''$ are the stoichiometric coefficients of reactants and products, respectively) and $R$ is the reaction rate.\nFor the reaction $A + B \\to C$, which is $1A + 1B \\to 1C$, the stoichiometric coefficients are $\\nu_A = -1$, $\\nu_B = -1$, and $\\nu_C = 1$. The problem states the intrinsic reaction rate is $R = k c_A c_B$. Therefore, the source terms for each species are:\n$$ \\dot{R}_A = (-1) R = -k c_A c_B $$\n$$ \\dot{R}_B = (-1) R = -k c_A c_B $$\n$$ \\dot{R}_C = (1) R = k c_A c_B $$\n\nNow, we convert the molar conservation equation to its mass-fraction form. The key definitions are:\nMolar concentration: $c_i = \\rho Y_i / M_i$\nMass diffusive flux: $\\mathbf{j}_i = M_i \\mathbf{J}_i$\nMass production rate: $\\dot{\\omega}_i = M_i \\dot{R}_i$\nwhere $\\rho$ is the mixture density, $Y_i$ is the mass fraction of species $i$, and $M_i$ is its molecular weight.\n\nWe start with the molar conservation equation and multiply it by $M_i$:\n$$ M_i \\frac{\\partial c_i}{\\partial t} + M_i \\nabla \\cdot (c_i \\mathbf{u}) + M_i \\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{J}_i = M_i \\dot{R}_i $$\nSubstituting $c_i = \\rho Y_i / M_i$ and recognizing that $M_i$ is a constant:\n$$ M_i \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t} \\left(\\frac{\\rho Y_i}{M_i}\\right) + M_i \\nabla \\cdot \\left(\\frac{\\rho Y_i}{M_i} \\mathbf{u}\\right) + \\nabla \\cdot (M_i \\mathbf{J}_i) = M_i \\dot{R}_i $$\n$$ \\frac{\\partial (\\rho Y_i)}{\\partial t} + \\nabla \\cdot (\\rho Y_i \\mathbf{u}) + \\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{j}_i = \\dot{\\omega}_i $$\nThis is the species conservation equation in terms of mass fraction $Y_i$. This form is often called the \"conservation form\". An alternative form using the material derivative can be found by expanding the first two terms and using the total mass continuity equation ($\\frac{\\partial \\rho}{\\partial t} + \\nabla \\cdot (\\rho \\mathbf{u}) = 0$), which yields $\\rho \\frac{D Y_i}{Dt} + \\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{j}_i = \\dot{\\omega}_i$. For the present purpose, the conservation form is sufficient.\n\nFinally, we determine the expression for the mass production rate of species $C$, denoted $\\dot{\\omega}_C$. From the definition, we have:\n$$ \\dot{\\omega}_C = M_C \\dot{R}_C $$\nFrom our earlier analysis of the reaction source term, we found:\n$$ \\dot{R}_C = k c_A c_B $$\nTherefore:\n$$ \\dot{\\omega}_C = M_C (k c_A c_B) $$\nTo express $\\dot{\\omega}_C$ in terms of the required variables ($k$, $\\rho$, $Y_{A}$, $Y_{B}$, $M_{A}$, $M_{B}$, $M_{C}$), we replace the molar concentrations $c_A$ and $c_B$ with their definitions in terms of mass fractions:\n$$ c_A = \\frac{\\rho Y_A}{M_A} $$\n$$ c_B = \\frac{\\rho Y_B}{M_B} $$\nSubstituting these into the expression for $\\dot{\\omega}_C$:\n$$ \\dot{\\omega}_C = M_C k \\left( \\frac{\\rho Y_A}{M_A} \\right) \\left( \\frac{\\rho Y_B}{M_B} \\right) $$\nRearranging the terms gives the final closed-form expression:\n$$ \\dot{\\omega}_C = k M_C \\frac{\\rho^2 Y_A Y_B}{M_A M_B} $$\nThis expression depends only on the variables specified in the problem statement.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{k M_{C} \\frac{\\rho^{2} Y_{A} Y_{B}}{M_{A} M_{B}}}$$", "id": "2523788"}, {"introduction": "With the general equation established, we can now apply it to a practical engineering device.

We define the stoichiometric mass ratio $s$ as:\n$$\ns = \\frac{\\nu_O W_O}{\\nu_F W_F}\n$$\nTherefore, $\\dot{\\omega}_O = s \\dot{\\omega}_F$.\n\n**1) Derivation of the conserved scalar**\n\nTo find a scalar field free of chemical source terms, we seek a linear combination of equations $(1)$ and $(2)$ that eliminates $\\dot{\\omega}_F$ and $\\dot{\\omega}_O$. Let us divide equation $(2)$ by $s$ and subtract it from equation $(1)$:\n$$\n\\left(\\rho D \\frac{d^2 Y_F}{dx^2} + \\dot{\\omega}_F\\right) - \\frac{1}{s}\\left(\\rho D \\frac{d^2 Y_O}{dx^2} + \\dot{\\omega}_O\\right) = 0 - 0 = 0\n$$\nRearranging and using the constant property assumptions:\n$$\n\\rho D \\left(\\frac{d^2 Y_F}{dx^2} - \\frac{1}{s}\\frac{d^2 Y_O}{dx^2}\\right) + \\left(\\dot{\\omega}_F - \\frac{\\dot{\\omega}_O}{s}\\right) = 0\n$$\n$$\n\\rho D \\frac{d^2}{dx^2} \\left(Y_F - \\frac{Y_O}{s}\\right) + \\left(\\dot{\\omega}_F - \\frac{s \\dot{\\omega}_F}{s}\\right) = 0\n$$\n$$\n\\rho D \\frac{d^2}{dx^2} \\left(Y_F - \\frac{Y_O}{s}\\right) + 0 = 0\n$$\nThis leads to the equation:\n$$\n\\frac{d^2}{dx^2} \\left(Y_F - \\frac{Y_O}{s}\\right) = 0\n$$\nThe scalar field $\\beta(x) = Y_F(x) - \\frac{Y_O(x)}{s}$ is therefore the conserved scalar, as its governing equation contains no chemical source term.\n\n**2) Normalization to define the mixture fraction $Z(x)$**\n\nThe mixture fraction $Z(x)$ is defined as a normalized form of the conserved scalar $\\beta(x)$ such that it satisfies the boundary conditions $Z(0) = 1$ and $Z(L) = 0$. A linear transformation of the form $Z(x) = a \\beta(x) + b$ will satisfy a homogeneous diffusion equation if $\\beta(x)$ does. Since $\\frac{d^2\\beta}{dx^2}=0$, it immediately follows that $\\frac{d^2Z}{dx^2} = a \\frac{d^2\\beta}{dx^2} = 0$. The equation for $Z(x)$ is thus:\n$$\n\\frac{d^2 Z}{dx^2} = 0\n$$\nThis is a homogeneous diffusion equation. Its general solution is $Z(x) = C_1 x + C_2$. The constants $C_1$ and $C_2$ are found from the boundary conditions for $Z(x)$:\nAt $x=0$: $Z(0) = C_1(0) + C_2 = C_2 = 1$.\nAt $x=L$: $Z(L) = C_1 L + C_2 = C_1 L + 1 = 0$, which gives $C_1 = -\\frac{1}{L}$.\nThe profile for the mixture fraction is therefore:\n$$\nZ(x) = 1 - \\frac{x}{L}\n$$\n\n**3) Determination of the stoichiometric mixture fraction $Z_{\\text{st}}$**\n\nThe mixture fraction $Z$ physically represents the mass fraction of material at a point $x$ that originated from the fuel stream at $x=0$. The remaining mass fraction, $1-Z$, originated from the oxidizer stream at $x=L$.\nConsider a sample mass $m$ at some location $x$. Before any reaction, the mass of fuel available in this sample would be $m_F^{\\text{unreacted}} = Y_{F,0} \\cdot (m Z)$, and the mass of oxidizer would be $m_O^{\\text{unreacted}} = Y_{O,L} \\cdot (m (1-Z))$.\nThe flame is located where these unreacted masses are in stoichiometric proportion. The stoichiometric mixture fraction $Z_{\\text{st}}$ is the value of $Z$ at this location. By definition of the stoichiometric mass ratio $s$, this condition is:\n$$\n\\frac{m_O^{\\text{unreacted}}}{m_F^{\\text{unreacted}}} = s\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{Y_{O,L} m(1-Z_{\\text{st}})}{Y_{F,0} m Z_{\\text{st}}} = s\n$$\nSolving for $Z_{\\text{st}}$:\n$$\nY_{O,L}(1-Z_{\\text{st}}) = s Y_{F,0} Z_{\\text{st}}\n$$\n$$\nY_{O,L} = s Y_{F,0} Z_{\\text{st}} + Y_{O,L} Z_{\\text{st}} = (s Y_{F,0} + Y_{O,L}) Z_{\\text{st}}\n$$\n$$\nZ_{\\text{st}} = \\frac{Y_{O,L}}{s Y_{F,0} + Y_{O,L}}\n$$\n\n**4) Expression for the flame-sheet location $x_f/L$ and its evaluation**\n\nThe infinitely fast chemistry assumption implies that fuel and oxidizer cannot coexist. The flame is an infinitesimally thin sheet at a location $x_f$ where both $Y_F(x_f) = 0$ and $Y_O(x_f) = 0$. At this location, the mixture fraction has the stoichiometric value, so $Z(x_f) = Z_{\\text{st}}$.\nUsing the derived expression for $Z(x)$:\n$$\nZ(x_f) = 1 - \\frac{x_f}{L}\n$$\nEquating this with the expression for $Z_{\\text{st}}$:\n$$\n1 - \\frac{x_f}{L} = \\frac{Y_{O,L}}{s Y_{F,0} + Y_{O,L}}\n$$\nNow, we solve for the non-dimensional flame location $x_f/L$:\n$$\n\\frac{x_f}{L} = 1 - \\frac{Y_{O,L}}{s Y_{F,0} + Y_{O,L}} = \\frac{(s Y_{F,0} + Y_{O,L}) - Y_{O,L}}{s Y_{F,0} + Y_{O,L}}\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{x_f}{L} = \\frac{s Y_{F,0}}{s Y_{F,0} + Y_{O,L}}\n$$\nThis is the closed-form expression for the flame-sheet location.\n\nFinally, we evaluate this expression for the given parameter values:\n- $W_F = 16$, $W_O = 32$, $\\nu_F = 1$, $\\nu_O = 2$.\n- $Y_{F,0} = 0.35$, $Y_{O,L} = 0.28$.\n\nFirst, calculate the stoichiometric mass ratio $s$:\n$$\ns = \\frac{\\nu_O W_O}{\\nu_F W_F} = \\frac{2 \\cdot 32}{1 \\cdot 16} = \\frac{64}{16} = 4\n$$\nNow, substitute the values into the expression for $x_f/L$:\n$$\n\\frac{x_f}{L} = \\frac{4 \\cdot (0.35)}{4 \\cdot (0.35) + 0.28} = \\frac{1.4}{1.4 + 0.28} = \\frac{1.4}{1.68}\n$$\nThe numerical value is:\n$$\n\\frac{x_f}{L} = \\frac{140}{168} = \\frac{5}{6} = 0.833333...\n$$\nRounding to four significant figures, the result is $0.8333$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.8333}$$", "id": "2523783"}]}
