The relationship between these quantities is given by the Stefan–Boltzmann law, $E_b(T) = \\sigma T^4$.\n\nThe analysis begins with the principles of first-order uncertainty propagation. For a general function $y = f(x)$, the uncertainty in $y$, denoted as $\\Delta y$, can be approximated from the uncertainty in $x$, denoted as $\\Delta x$, using a first-order Taylor series expansion, provided that $\\Delta x$ is sufficiently small. This approximation is given by:\n$$ \\Delta y \\approx \\left| \\frac{df}{dx} \\right| \\Delta x $$\nTo find the relative uncertainty, $\\frac{\\Delta y}{y}$, we divide by the function value $y = f(x)$:\n$$ \\frac{\\Delta y}{y} \\approx \\frac{1}{|f(x)|} \\left| \\frac{df}{dx} \\right| \\Delta x = \\left| \\frac{f'(x)}{f(x)} \\right| \\Delta x $$\nThis can be expressed in terms of the relative uncertainty in $x$, $\\frac{\\Delta x}{x}$, as:\n$$ \\frac{\\Delta y}{y} \\approx \\left| \\frac{x f'(x)}{f(x)} \\right| \\frac{\\Delta x}{x} $$\n\nWe apply this general formalism to the specific function at hand, the Stefan–Boltzmann law for blackbody emissive power:\n$$ E_b(T) = \\sigma T^4 $$\nHere, the emissive power $E_b$ is analogous to $y$, and the absolute temperature $T$ is analogous to $x$. The function is $f(T) = \\sigma T^4$. The Stefan–Boltzmann constant $\\sigma$ is given as an exact constant, meaning it has zero uncertainty ($\\Delta \\sigma = 0$). The uncertainty therefore propagates only from the temperature measurement.\n\nFirst, we must compute the derivative of $E_b$ with respect to $T$:\n$$ \\frac{dE_b}{dT} = \\frac{d}{dT}(\\sigma T^4) $$\nSince $\\sigma$ is a constant, we have:\n$$ \\frac{dE_b}{dT} = 4 \\sigma T^3 $$\n\nNow, we can express the absolute uncertainty in emissive power, $\\Delta E_b$, using the first-order approximation:\n$$ \\Delta E_b \\approx \\left| \\frac{dE_b}{dT} \\right| \\Delta T = (4 \\sigma T^3) \\Delta T $$\nWe use absolute values for generality, but since power and temperature are non-negative, the absolute value signs can be dropped.\n\nThe problem asks for the *relative* uncertainty in $E_b$, which is $\\frac{\\Delta E_b}{E_b}$. To find this, we divide the expression for $\\Delta E_b$ by the original function $E_b(T) = \\sigma T^4$:\n$$ \\frac{\\Delta E_b}{E_b} \\approx \\frac{4 \\sigma T^3 \\Delta T}{\\sigma T^4} $$\n\nSimplifying this expression by canceling common terms ($\\sigma$ and $T^3$) yields the symbolic relationship between the relative uncertainties:\n$$ \\frac{\\Delta E_b}{E_b} \\approx 4 \\frac{\\Delta T}{T} $$\nThis is the derived first-order propagated relative uncertainty. It shows that the relative uncertainty in the emissive power is precisely four times the relative uncertainty in the absolute temperature. This factor of $4$ originates directly from the exponent in the Stefan-Boltzmann law.\n\nThe problem provides the numerical value for the relative uncertainty in temperature:\n$$ \\frac{\\Delta T}{T} = 0.010 $$\n\nWe substitute this value into our derived expression to find the numerical value of the relative uncertainty in the emissive power:\n$$ \\frac{\\Delta E_b}{E_b} \\approx 4 \\times 0.010 = 0.040 $$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to three significant figures. The calculated value is $0.040$. To express it with three significant figures, we write it as $0.0400$.\n\nThe interpretation of this result is direct and fundamentally important in the field of radiometry and pyrometry. The fact that $\\frac{\\Delta E_b}{E_b} \\approx 4 \\frac{\\Delta T}{T}$ demonstrates a significant amplification of measurement uncertainty. A modest $1\\%$ uncertainty in temperature measurement leads to a $4\\%$ uncertainty in the inferred radiant power. This high sensitivity implies that for applications relying on the Stefan-Boltzmann law to determine radiative heat flux from temperature (for example, non-contact temperature sensing or furnace analysis), extremely high-precision temperature measurement is a critical design requirement.

Both quantities are unitless.", "solution": "The problem is divided into three parts. We will address each in order.\n\nPart 1: Derivation of the Emissive Power Relation\n\nThe fundamental starting point is Planck's law for the spectral, hemispherical emissive power of a blackbody at absolute temperature $T$:\n$$E_{b,\\lambda}(\\lambda, T) = \\frac{C_1}{\\lambda^5 \\left[\\exp\\left(\\frac{C_2}{\\lambda T}\\right) - 1\\right]}$$\nwhere $\\lambda$ is the wavelength, $C_1 = 2\\pi h c^2$ is the first radiation constant, and $C_2 = hc/k_B$ is the second radiation constant, with $h$ being the Planck constant, $c$ the speed of light in vacuum, and $k_B$ the Boltzmann constant.\n\nTo find the total hemispherical emissive power of a blackbody, $E_b(T)$, we must integrate $E_{b,\\lambda}$ over all wavelengths from $\\lambda=0$ to $\\lambda=\\infty$:\n$$E_b(T) = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} E_{b,\\lambda}(\\lambda, T) \\, d\\lambda = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\frac{C_1}{\\lambda^5 \\left[\\exp\\left(\\frac{C_2}{\\lambda T}\\right) - 1\\right]} \\, d\\lambda$$\nTo evaluate this integral, we introduce a change of variables. Let $x = \\frac{C_2}{\\lambda T}$. This implies $\\lambda = \\frac{C_2}{xT}$ and $d\\lambda = -\\frac{C_2}{x^2 T} dx$. The limits of integration transform as follows: as $\\lambda \\to 0$, $x \\to \\infty$; as $\\lambda \\to \\infty$, $x \\to 0$.\nSubstituting these into the integral gives:\n$$E_b(T) = \\int_{\\infty}^{0} \\frac{C_1}{\\left(\\frac{C_2}{xT}\\right)^5 \\left[\\exp(x) - 1\\right]} \\left(-\\frac{C_2}{x^2 T}\\right) \\, dx$$\nReversing the limits of integration cancels the negative sign:\n$$E_b(T) = C_1 \\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\frac{(xT)^5}{C_2^5 \\left[\\exp(x) - 1\\right]} \\frac{C_2}{x^2 T} \\, dx = \\frac{C_1 T^4}{C_2^4} \\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\frac{x^3}{\\exp(x) - 1} \\, dx$$\nThe definite integral $\\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\frac{x^3}{\\exp(x) - 1} \\, dx$ is a standard form whose value is $\\frac{\\pi^4}{15}$. Therefore,\n$$E_b(T) = \\frac{C_1 T^4}{C_2^4} \\frac{\\pi^4}{15}$$\nSubstituting the expressions for $C_1$ and $C_2$:\n$$E_b(T) = \\frac{2\\pi h c^2}{(hc/k_B)^4} \\frac{\\pi^4}{15} T^4 = \\left(\\frac{2\\pi^5 k_B^4}{15 c^2 h^3}\\right) T^4$$\nThe term in the parenthesis is a combination of fundamental physical constants and is defined as the Stefan-Boltzmann constant, $\\sigma$. Thus, we have derived the Stefan-Boltzmann law for a blackbody:\n$$E_b(T) = \\sigma T^4$$\nNow, consider the given surface, which is not a blackbody. The total hemispherical emissive power $E$ of a real surface is given by the integration of its spectral emissive power, $E_{\\lambda}(T)$, over all wavelengths. The spectral emissive power is related to that of a blackbody by the spectral, hemispherical emissivity, $\\epsilon_{\\lambda}$:\n$$E_{\\lambda}(T) = \\epsilon_{\\lambda} E_{b,\\lambda}(\\lambda, T)$$\nIntegrating this gives the total emissive power:\n$$E(T) = \\int_0^\\infty E_{\\lambda}(T) \\, d\\lambda = \\int_0^\\infty \\epsilon_{\\lambda} E_{b,\\lambda}(\\lambda, T) \\, d\\lambda$$\nThe problem specifies the surface is gray, which is the idealization that emissivity is independent of wavelength, i.e., $\\epsilon_{\\lambda} = \\epsilon = \\text{constant}$. This constant $\\epsilon$ can be moved outside the integral:\n$$E(T) = \\epsilon \\int_0^\\infty E_{b,\\lambda}(\\lambda, T) \\, d\\lambda$$\nThe remaining integral is precisely the total hemispherical emissive power of a blackbody, $E_b(T) = \\sigma T^4$. The relation for the gray surface is therefore:\n$$E = \\epsilon \\sigma T^4$$\nThis is the required relationship between the surface's total hemispherical emissive power $E$ and its absolute temperature $T$, expressed in terms of the surface property $\\epsilon$ and the universal Stefan-Boltzmann constant $\\sigma$.\n\nPart 2: Estimation of Emissivity\n\nWe use the derived relation $E = \\epsilon \\sigma T^4$ and the provided experimental data to determine the emissivity $\\epsilon$.\nThe given data are: $E = 25 \\ \\mathrm{kW/m^2} = 25 \\times 10^3 \\ \\mathrm{W/m^2}$ and $T = 1200 \\ \\mathrm{K}$. The Stefan-Boltzmann constant is $\\sigma \\approx 5.67 \\times 10^{-8} \\ \\mathrm{W \\cdot m^{-2} \\cdot K^{-4}}$.\nSolving for $\\epsilon$:\n$$\\epsilon = \\frac{E}{\\sigma T^4}$$\nSubstituting the numerical values:\n$$\\epsilon = \\frac{25 \\times 10^3}{ (5.67 \\times 10^{-8}) \\times (1200)^4 }$$\nFirst, calculate $T^4$:\n$$(1200)^4 = (1.2 \\times 10^3)^4 = 2.0736 \\times 10^{12} \\ \\mathrm{K^4}$$\nNow, calculate the denominator:\n$$\\sigma T^4 = (5.67 \\times 10^{-8}) \\times (2.0736 \\times 10^{12}) \\approx 117572.72 \\ \\mathrm{W/m^2}$$\nFinally, compute $\\epsilon$:\n$$\\epsilon = \\frac{25000}{117572.72} \\approx 0.212623$$\nRounding to four significant figures as requested, the surface emissivity is $\\epsilon = 0.2126$.\n\nPart 3: Net Heat Flux and Sensitivity Analysis\n\nFor radiative exchange between the surface at temperature $T$ and a large enclosure at temperature $T_{\\text{env}}$, the net outward heat flux $q''$ from the surface is the difference between its radiosity $J$ and the irradiation $G$ upon it:\n$$q'' = J - G$$\nFor an opaque surface, the radiosity is the sum of emitted and reflected radiation:\n$$J = E + \\rho G$$\nwhere $E$ is the emissive power of the surface and $\\rho$ is its reflectivity.\nThe irradiation $G$ from a large, isothermal enclosure is equivalent to the emissive power of a blackbody at the enclosure's temperature:\n$$G = E_{b, \\text{env}} = \\sigma T_{\\text{env}}^4$$\nFor an opaque surface, conservation of energy for incident radiation requires that the sum of absorptivity $\\alpha$ and reflectivity $\\rho$ is unity: $\\alpha + \\rho = 1$. By Kirchhoff's law for a gray surface in thermal equilibrium with its surroundings (or for which the irradiation is from a blackbody source), the absorptivity is equal to the emissivity: $\\alpha = \\epsilon$.\nTherefore, the reflectivity is $\\rho = 1 - \\alpha = 1 - \\epsilon$.\nThe emissive power of the gray surface is $E = \\epsilon E_b(T) = \\epsilon \\sigma T^4$.\nSubstituting these relations back into the expression for radiosity:\n$$J = \\epsilon \\sigma T^4 + (1 - \\epsilon) G$$\nNow, substitute this expression for $J$ into the net heat flux equation:\n$$q'' = J - G = (\\epsilon \\sigma T^4 + (1 - \\epsilon) G) - G = \\epsilon \\sigma T^4 - \\epsilon G$$\nFinally, substituting $G = \\sigma T_{\\text{env}}^4$:\n$$q'' = \\epsilon \\sigma T^4 - \\epsilon \\sigma T_{\\text{env}}^4 = \\epsilon \\sigma (T^4 - T_{\\text{env}}^4)$$\nThis is the expression for the net outward radiative heat flux from the surface.\n\nNext, we derive the relative sensitivity of the heat flux to the emissivity, defined as $S_{\\epsilon} \\equiv \\frac{\\partial \\ln q''}{\\partial \\ln \\epsilon}$.\nWe can find this by taking the natural logarithm of $q''$:\n$$\\ln q'' = \\ln(\\epsilon \\sigma (T^4 - T_{\\text{env}}^4))$$\nUsing the properties of logarithms, this separates into:\n$$\\ln q'' = \\ln \\epsilon + \\ln(\\sigma (T^4 - T_{\\text{env}}^4))$$\nNow, we differentiate with respect to $\\ln \\epsilon$. The term $\\ln(\\sigma(T^4 - T_{\\text{env}}^4))$ is constant with respect to $\\epsilon$.\n$$S_{\\epsilon} = \\frac{\\partial (\\ln q'')}{\\partial (\\ln \\epsilon)} = \\frac{\\partial (\\ln \\epsilon)}{\\partial (\\ln \\epsilon)} + \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial (\\ln \\epsilon)} \\left[\\ln(\\sigma (T^4 - T_{\\text{env}}^4))\\right]$$\nThe derivative of a variable with respect to itself is $1$, and the derivative of a constant is $0$.\n$$S_{\\epsilon} = 1 + 0 = 1$$\nThus, the sensitivity $S_{\\epsilon}$ is exactly $1$.\n\nThe implication of this result for uncertainty propagation is direct. The sensitivity $S_{\\epsilon}$ relates the relative uncertainty in $q''$ to the relative uncertainty in $\\epsilon$ via the approximation:\n$$\\frac{\\Delta q''}{q''} \\approx S_{\\epsilon} \\frac{\\Delta \\epsilon}{\\epsilon}$$\nSince $S_{\\epsilon} = 1$, we have:\n$$\\frac{\\Delta q''}{q''} \\approx \\frac{\\Delta \\epsilon}{\\epsilon}$$\nThis means that the relative uncertainty in the predicted net heat flux is identical to the relative uncertainty in the surface emissivity. For example, an uncertainty of $10\\%$ in the measurement or estimation of $\\epsilon$ will lead directly to a $10\\%$ uncertainty in the calculated value of $q''$.

Note that the inversion of integration limits cancels the negative sign.\n\nThe total emissive power is the integral over all wavelengths, which corresponds to $x$ from $\\infty$ (for $\\lambda=0$) to $0$ (for $\\lambda=\\infty$):\n$$\\sigma T^4 = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} E_{b,\\lambda}(\\lambda, T) \\, d\\lambda = \\frac{C_1 T^4}{C_2^4} \\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\frac{x^3}{\\exp(x) - 1} \\, dx$$\nThe definite integral $\\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\frac{x^3}{e^x - 1} \\, dx$ is a standard form related to the Bose-Einstein integral and Riemann zeta function, and its value is known to be $\\frac{\\pi^4}{15}$.\nThus, we can express the Stefan-Boltzmann constant as:\n$$\\sigma = \\frac{C_1}{C_2^4} \\frac{\\pi^4}{15} = \\frac{2\\pi h c^2}{\\left(\\frac{hc}{k_B}\\right)^4} \\frac{\\pi^4}{15} = \\frac{2\\pi^5 k_B^4}{15 h^3 c^2}$$\nThis confirms the relationship between the fundamental constants.\n\nNow, we can write the fraction $F_{(\\lambda_1, \\lambda_2)}(T)$ as a ratio of dimensionless integrals:\n$$F_{(\\lambda_1, \\lambda_2)}(T) = \\frac{\\frac{C_1 T^4}{C_2^4} \\int_{x_2}^{x_1} \\frac{x^3}{\\exp(x) - 1} \\, dx}{\\frac{C_1 T^4}{C_2^4} \\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\frac{x^3}{\\exp(x) - 1} \\, dx} = \\frac{\\int_{C_2/(\\lambda_2 T)}^{C_2/(\\lambda_1 T)} \\frac{x^3}{\\exp(x) - 1} \\, dx}{\\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\frac{x^3}{\\exp(x) - 1} \\, dx}$$\nSubstituting the value of the denominator integral:\n$$F_{(\\lambda_1, \\lambda_2)}(T) = \\frac{15}{\\pi^4} \\int_{C_2/(\\lambda_2 T)}^{C_2/(\\lambda_1 T)} \\frac{x^3}{\\exp(x) - 1} \\, dx$$\nThis expression demonstrates explicitly that the fraction $F_{(\\lambda_1, \\lambda_2)}(T)$ is a function only of the products $\\lambda_1 T$ and $\\lambda_2 T$, as required. This framework is ideal for numerical evaluation due to the well-behaved nature of the dimensionless integrand.\n\nNow, for the interpretation prompt:\n1.  **Equality of fractions for test cases 6 and 7**:\n    For case 6: $\\lambda_1 = 2.0 \\times 10^{-6}\\ \\mathrm{m}$, $\\lambda_2 = 4.0 \\times 10^{-6}\\ \\mathrm{m}$, $T = 1000\\ \\mathrm{K}$.\n    The products are $\\lambda_1 T = 2000 \\times 10^{-6}\\ \\mathrm{m \\cdot K}$ and $\\lambda_2 T = 4000 \\times 10^{-6}\\ \\mathrm{m \\cdot K}$.\n    For case 7: $\\lambda_1 = 1.0 \\times 10^{-6}\\ \\mathrm{m}$, $\\lambda_2 = 2.0 \\times 10^{-6}\\ \\mathrm{m}$, $T = 2000\\ \\mathrm{K}$.\n    The products are $\\lambda_1 T = 2000 \\times 10^{-6}\\ \\mathrm{m \\cdot K}$ and $\\lambda_2 T = 4000 \\times 10^{-6}\\ \\mathrm{m \\cdot K}$.\n    As derived, the fraction $F_{(\\lambda_1, \\lambda_2)}(T)$ depends only on the products $\\lambda_1 T$ and $\\lambda_2 T$, which determine the integration limits for the dimensionless variable $x$. Since these products are identical for both cases, the value of the fraction must also be identical, up to the precision of the numerical calculation.\n\n2.  **Change in fraction for the visible band ($0.38 - 0.78\\ \\mu\\mathrm{m}$) with temperature**:\n    This analysis involves Wien's displacement law, which is a direct consequence of Planck's law. The law states that the wavelength of maximum spectral emission, $\\lambda_{\\max}$, is inversely proportional to the temperature: $\\lambda_{\\max} T = b$, where $b \\approx 2898\\ \\mu\\mathrm{m} \\cdot \\mathrm{K}$.\n    For $T = 3000\\ \\mathrm{K}$ (case 3), the peak emission occurs at $\\lambda_{\\max} \\approx \\frac{2898}{3000} \\approx 0.97\\ \\mu\\mathrm{m}$. This wavelength is in the near-infrared, just beyond the red end of the visible band ($0.78\\ \\mu\\mathrm{m}$). Therefore, at $3000\\ \\mathrm{K}$, the bulk of the radiated energy is at wavelengths longer than visible light, and only a fraction falls within the visible spectrum.\n    For $T = 5800\\ \\mathrm{K}$ (case 2), which is approximately the sun's surface temperature, the peak emission is at $\\lambda_{\\max} \\approx \\frac{2898}{5800} \\approx 0.50\\ \\mu\\mathrm{m}$. This wavelength lies in the green-yellow part of the spectrum, squarely in the middle of the visible band ($0.38-0.78\\ \\mu\\mathrm{m}$).\n    As the temperature increases from $3000\\ \\mathrm{K}$ to $5800\\ \\mathrm{K}$, the peak of the Planck distribution shifts from the infrared into the visible range. Consequently, a much larger proportion of the total radiated energy is emitted within the visible wavelengths. Therefore, $F_{(0.38\\ \\mu\\mathrm{m},0.78\\ \\mu\\mathrm{m})}(5800\\ \\mathrm{K})$ will be significantly larger than $F_{(0.38\\ \\mu\\mathrm{m},0.78\\ \\mu\\mathrm{m})}(3000\\ \\mathrm{K})$. The body appears to glow more brightly and shift in color from reddish to yellowish-white.\n\nThe numerical implementation will use the derived dimensionless integral formulation for superior stability and accuracy.", "answer": "```python\n# The complete and runnable Python 3 code goes here.\n# Imports must adhere to the specified execution environment.\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy.integrate import quad\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Computes the fraction of blackbody radiation in a wavelength band for given test cases.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define physical constants from the problem statement.\n    H = 6.62607015e-34  # Planck constant (J.s)\n    C = 2.99792458e8    # Speed of light in vacuum (m/s)\n    KB = 1.380649e-23   # Boltzmann constant (J/K)\n    # The Stefan-Boltzmann constant SIGMA is not needed due to the dimensionless integral formulation.\n\n    # Calculate the second radiation constant.\n    C2 = H * C / KB  # (m.K)\n\n    # Test suite: (lambda1_um, lambda2_um, T_K)\n    # Wavelengths are in micrometers and will be converted to meters.\n    test_cases = [\n        (0, np.inf, 300),        # Case 1: Full spectrum, should be 1.0\n        (0.38, 0.78, 5800),     # Case 2: Visible light at sun's temperature\n        (0.38, 0.78, 3000),     # Case 3: Visible light at lower temperature\n        (8, 14, 300),           # Case 4: Thermal infrared at room temperature\n        (0.1, 0.4, 5800),       # Case 5: Ultraviolet at sun's temperature\n        (2.0, 4.0, 1000),       # Case 6: Test for lambda*T scaling\n        (1.0, 2.0, 2000),       # Case 7: Test for lambda*T scaling\n    ]\n\n    results = []\n\n    # The dimensionless integrand from the derivation.\n    def integrand(x):\n        \"\"\"\n        Dimensionless integrand x^3 / (exp(x) - 1).\n        This form is numerically stable.\n        \"\"\"\n        # For very large x, exp(x) overflows, but the integrand approaches 0.\n        # np.exp(709.78) is the approximate float limit.\n        if x  700:\n            return 0.0\n        # For very small x, the denominator approaches 0, but can be approximated.\n        # However, `quad` handles this endpoint singularity correctly.\n        if x == 0:\n            return 0.0 # Mathematically the limit is 0 as x^3 dominates.\n        return x**3 / (np.exp(x) - 1)\n\n    # The value of the total integral from 0 to infinity is known analytically.\n    # integral_0^inf [x^3 / (exp(x) - 1)] dx = pi^4 / 15\n    total_integral_val = np.pi**4 / 15\n\n    for l1_um, l2_um, T in test_cases:\n        # Convert wavelengths from micrometers to meters.\n        l1_m = l1_um * 1e-6\n        l2_m = l2_um * 1e-6\n\n        # Calculate the integration limits for the dimensionless variable x.\n        # x = C2 / (lambda * T)\n        # Handle boundary cases for lambda = 0 and lambda = +inf.\n        if l1_m == 0:\n            x1 = np.inf\n        else:\n            x1 = C2 / (l1_m * T)\n\n        if np.isinf(l2_m):\n            x2 = 0\n        else:\n            x2 = C2 / (l2_m * T)\n\n        # The integral is from x2 to x1, as d(lambda) introduces a negative sign.\n        # quad(func, a, b) integrates from a to b.\n        integral_val, _ = quad(integrand, x2, x1)\n\n        # The fraction is the ratio of the band integral to the total integral.\n        fraction = integral_val / total_integral_val\n        results.append(f\"{fraction:.8f}\")\n\n    # Final print statement must be a single-line, comma-separated list\n    # enclosed in square brackets with no spaces.\n    print(f\"[{','.join(results)}]\")\n\nsolve()\n```", "id": "2526932"}]}
