At time $t=0$, a uniform volumetric heat generation at a constant rate $q'''$ begins throughout the sphere while the sphere is simultaneously exposed to convection with a surrounding fluid at temperature $T_{\\infty}$ and a spatially uniform heat transfer coefficient $h$. The sphere’s thermophysical properties are constant and equal to density $\\rho$, specific heat at constant pressure $c_{p}$, and thermal conductivity $k$. Assume the fluid temperature $T_{\\infty}$ does not change with time and the only mode of heat transfer at the sphere boundary is convection.

The data provided are consistent with known material properties (specifically, copper) and represent a physically realistic scenario. The language is objective and precise. The problem contains no scientific unsoundness, missing information, or logical contradictions. It is a standard, solvable problem in transient heat conduction.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. A solution will be provided.\n\nThe first required action is to verify that the lumped-capacitance approximation is justified. This approximation assumes a spatially uniform temperature distribution within the solid, which is valid when the internal conductive resistance is negligible compared to the external convective resistance. The ratio of these resistances is given by the Biot number, $Bi$.\nThe Biot number is defined as:\n$$Bi = \\frac{h L_c}{k}$$\nwhere $L_c$ is the characteristic length of the body. For a sphere, the characteristic length is the ratio of its volume $V$ to its surface area $A_s$.\n$$V = \\frac{4}{3} \\pi R^3$$\n$$A_s = 4 \\pi R^2$$\nThus, the characteristic length is:\n$$L_c = \\frac{V}{A_s} = \\frac{\\frac{4}{3} \\pi R^3}{4 \\pi R^2} = \\frac{R}{3}$$\nBefore calculating the Biot number, we must convert the radius to SI units: $R = 2.0\\ \\mathrm{mm} = 2.0 \\times 10^{-3}\\ \\mathrm{m}$.\nThe characteristic length is $L_c = \\frac{2.0 \\times 10^{-3}}{3}\\ \\mathrm{m}$.\nNow, we substitute the given values into the Biot number definition:\n$$Bi = \\frac{(250\\ \\mathrm{W/(m^2\\,K)}) \\left(\\frac{2.0 \\times 10^{-3}}{3}\\ \\mathrm{m}\\right)}{400\\ \\mathrm{W/(m\\,K)}} = \\frac{250 \\times 2.0 \\times 10^{-3}}{3 \\times 400} = \\frac{500 \\times 10^{-3}}{1200} \\approx 4.17 \\times 10^{-4}$$\nThe criterion for the lumped-capacitance method to be valid is $Bi \\ll 0.1$. Since our calculated value $Bi \\approx 4.17 \\times 10^{-4}$ is substantially smaller than $0.1$, the temperature distribution within the sphere can be assumed to be uniform at any instant in time. Therefore, the volume-averaged temperature $\\bar{T}(t)$ is equal to the temperature throughout the sphere, which we will denote as $T(t)$.\n\nNext, we apply the first law of thermodynamics to the sphere, treating it as a control volume. The energy balance is expressed as:\n$$\\frac{dE_{st}}{dt} = \\dot{E}_{in} - \\dot{E}_{out} + \\dot{E}_{gen}$$\nwhere $\\frac{dE_{st}}{dt}$ is the rate of change of energy stored in the control volume, $\\dot{E}_{in}$ is the rate of energy entering, $\\dot{E}_{out}$ is the rate of energy leaving, and $\\dot{E}_{gen}$ is the rate of energy generated within the volume.\nFor this problem:\n-   The rate of change of stored energy for an incompressible substance is $\\frac{dE_{st}}{dt} = \\rho V c_p \\frac{dT}{dt}$.\n-   There is no energy entering the control volume from the outside, so $\\dot{E}_{in} = 0$.\n-   Energy leaves the control volume via convection from the surface, given by Newton's law of cooling: $\\dot{E}_{out} = h A_s (T(t) - T_{\\infty})$.\n-   Energy is generated volumetrically at a constant rate $q'''$, so the total generation rate is $\\dot{E}_{gen} = q''' V$.\n\nSubstituting these terms into the energy balance equation:\n$$\\rho V c_p \\frac{dT}{dt} = -h A_s (T - T_{\\infty}) + q''' V$$\nTo solve this first-order ordinary differential equation, we divide by $\\rho V c_p$:\n$$\\frac{dT}{dt} = -\\frac{h A_s}{\\rho V c_p} (T - T_{\\infty}) + \\frac{q'''}{\\rho c_p}$$\nUsing the relation $\\frac{A_s}{V} = \\frac{3}{R}$, the equation becomes:\n$$\\frac{dT}{dt} = -\\frac{3h}{\\rho c_p R} (T - T_{\\infty}) + \\frac{q'''}{\\rho c_p}$$\nRearranging the terms:\n$$\\frac{dT}{dt} + \\frac{3h}{\\rho c_p R} T = \\frac{3h T_{\\infty}}{\\rho c_p R} + \\frac{q'''}{\\rho c_p}$$\nThis is a linear first-order ODE of the form $\\frac{dT}{dt} + aT = b$, where $a = \\frac{3h}{\\rho c_p R}$ and $b = \\frac{3h T_{\\infty}}{\\rho c_p R} + \\frac{q'''}{\\rho c_p}$.\nThe general solution is $T(t) = C \\exp(-at) + b/a$. The steady-state temperature is $T_{ss} = b/a = T_{\\infty} + \\frac{q'''R}{3h}$.\nThe solution can be written as:\n$$T(t) = T_{ss} + (T_0 - T_{ss})\\exp(-at)$$\nGiven that the initial temperature $T_0 = T_{\\infty}$, this simplifies. The solution becomes:\n$$T(t) - T_{\\infty} = (T_{ss} - T_{\\infty})(1 - \\exp(-at))$$\nSubstituting the expressions for $T_{ss}$ and $a$:\n$$T(t) - T_{\\infty} = \\left(\\frac{q''' R}{3h}\\right) \\left(1 - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{3h}{\\rho c_p R} t\\right)\\right)$$\nWe need to find the time $t$ at which the temperature reaches the target value, $T(t) = \\bar{T}$. Let us denote this target temperature as $T_f$.\n$$T_f - T_{\\infty} = \\left(\\frac{q''' R}{3h}\\right) \\left(1 - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{3h}{\\rho c_p R} t\\right)\\right)$$\nSolving for $t$:\n$$1 - \\frac{3h (T_f - T_{\\infty})}{q''' R} = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{3h}{\\rho c_p R} t\\right)$$\nTaking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n$$\\ln\\left(1 - \\frac{3h (T_f - T_{\\infty})}{q''' R}\\right) = -\\frac{3h}{\\rho c_p R} t$$\n$$t = -\\frac{\\rho c_p R}{3h} \\ln\\left(1 - \\frac{3h (T_f - T_{\\infty})}{q''' R}\\right)$$\nNow we substitute the numerical values:\n-   $T_f = 310\\ \\mathrm{K}$\n-   The pre-factor term is $\\frac{\\rho c_p R}{3h} = \\frac{(8960)(385)(2.0 \\times 10^{-3})}{3(250)} = \\frac{6899.2}{750} \\approx 9.1989\\ \\mathrm{s}$.\n-   The argument of the logarithm is $1 - \\frac{3(250)(310 - 300)}{(5.0 \\times 10^6)(2.0 \\times 10^{-3})} = 1 - \\frac{750(10)}{10000} = 1 - 0.75 = 0.25$.\n\nSubstituting these values into the expression for $t$:\n$$t = -(9.1989\\ \\mathrm{s}) \\ln(0.25) = -(9.1989\\ \\mathrm{s}) (-\\ln(4)) = (9.1989\\ \\mathrm{s}) \\ln(4)$$\n$$t \\approx (9.1989\\ \\mathrm{s}) \\times 1.38629 \\approx 12.7558\\ \\mathrm{s}$$\nRounding the result to three significant figures, the time required is $12.8\\ \\mathrm{s}$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{12.8}\n$$", "id": "2486348"}, {"introduction": "Moving from closed systems to open, flowing systems, this practice problem tackles the energy balance for a steady-state heat exchanger.

The provided equations are standard. The concept of viscous dissipation ($\\Phi$) as the mechanism for converting mechanical work into internal energy is fundamental and correct.\n2.  **Well-Posedness:** The problem is well-posed. It requires the application of established principles to three distinct, clearly defined control volumes. A logical and unique conclusion for each case can be derived.\n3.  **Objectivity and Clarity:** The language is technical and precise. Ambiguities are minimal. The term \"adiabatically jacketed\" juxtaposed with a \"heat loss\" term $\\dot{Q}_{\\ell}$ is understood in engineering context as an intended design versus a real-world model that accounts for imperfections. The sign convention is explicitly stated. Important assumptions, such as negligible mass flow and certain energy changes, are provided.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem statement is found to be valid. It is a rigorous conceptual problem that is scientifically sound and well-posed. A solution will be derived.\n\n**Derivation of Governing Principles**\n\nThe First Law for a closed system (no mass flow) is given as:\n$$ \\frac{dE_{CV}}{dt} = \\dot{Q}_{CS} - \\dot{W}_{CS} $$\nwhere $E_{CV}$ is the total energy of the control volume, $\\dot{Q}_{CS}$ is the net rate of heat transfer into the CV, and $\\dot{W}_{CS}$ is the net rate of work done by the CV. The total energy is the sum of internal energy $U_{CV}$, kinetic energy $K_{CV}$, and potential energy $P_{CV}$. Given the problem statement, changes in potential energy are negligible.\n$$ E_{CV} = U_{CV} + K_{CV} $$\nThus, the total energy balance is:\n$$ \\frac{dU_{CV}}{dt} + \\frac{dK_{CV}}{dt} = \\dot{Q}_{CS} - \\dot{W}_{CS} $$\nThis is an equation for *total energy*. To obtain a *thermal energy balance*, which is an equation for internal energy $U_{CV}$, we must isolate $\\frac{dU_{CV}}{dt}$:\n$$ \\frac{dU_{CV}}{dt} = \\dot{Q}_{CS} - \\dot{W}_{CS} - \\frac{dK_{CV}}{dt} $$\nThe rate of change of kinetic energy, $\\frac{dK_{CV}}{dt}$, is governed by the mechanical energy balance. Mechanical energy is added to the CV via work done by external forces (e.g., a rotating shaft) and is dissipated into internal energy by irreversible processes, primarily viscous dissipation ($\\Phi$). The mechanical energy balance is:\n$$ \\frac{dK_{CV}}{dt} = \\dot{W}_{\\text{mech, on CV}} - \\int_{CV} \\Phi \\, dV $$\nwhere $\\dot{W}_{\\text{mech, on CV}}$ is the rate of mechanical work done *on* the CV. This term is related to the work term in the First Law, $\\dot{W}_{CS}$, which is work done *by* the CV. Specifically, if only shaft work is present, $\\dot{W}_{CS} = -\\dot{W}_{\\text{mech, on CV}}$.\n\nSubstituting the mechanical energy balance into the thermal energy balance yields:\n$$ \\frac{dU_{CV}}{dt} = \\dot{Q}_{CS} - \\dot{W}_{CS} - \\left( \\dot{W}_{\\text{mech, on CV}} - \\int_{CV} \\Phi \\, dV \\right) $$\nIf the work $\\dot{W}_{CS}$ consists only of mechanical shaft work, then $\\dot{W}_{CS} = - \\dot{W}_{\\text{mech, on CV}}$. Let the magnitude of the shaft power input be $P_s$, so $\\dot{W}_{\\text{mech, on CV}} = P_s$ and $\\dot{W}_{CS} = -P_s$. The equation becomes:\n$$ \\frac{dU_{CV}}{dt} = \\dot{Q}_{CS} - (-P_s) - \\left( P_s - \\int_{CV} \\Phi \\, dV \\right) = \\dot{Q}_{CS} + P_s - P_s + \\int_{CV} \\Phi \\, dV $$\n$$ \\frac{dU_{CV}}{dt} = \\dot{Q}_{CS} + \\int_{CV} \\Phi \\, dV $$\nThis final equation is the thermal (internal) energy balance. It shows that the effect of shaft work on the internal energy is fully captured by the viscous dissipation term, which acts as a volumetric source of internal energy. At steady operation, the fluid's kinetic energy is statistically constant, so $\\frac{dK_{CV}}{dt} = 0$. In this case, the mechanical energy balance simplifies to $\\dot{W}_{\\text{mech, on CV}} = P_s = \\int_{CV} \\Phi \\, dV$.\n\nWe will now evaluate each case and statement with these principles.\n\n**Option-by-Option Analysis**\n\n**A. Under Case $1$, the shaft power appears as a boundary work transfer across the control surface, i.e., it contributes to $\\dot{W}_{CS}$ with sign such that mechanical power is delivered to the CV. Upon reducing the total energy balance to a thermal (internal energy) balance for the well-mixed liquid (neglecting accumulation of mechanical energy), this same input can be represented equivalently as an internal generation term $\\int_{CV}\\Phi\\,dV$ whose volume integral equals $P_{s}$ in steady operation.**\n\nIn Case $1$, the CV is the liquid only. The control surface cuts the shaft, and more specifically, it consists of the moving surfaces of the impeller, which do work on the fluid. This work is boundary work. The power is delivered *to* the CV with magnitude $P_s$. Following the sign convention (work done *by* CV is positive), the work term in the First Law is $\\dot{W}_{CS} = -P_s$. So the first part of the statement is correct. The total energy balance is $\\frac{d(U_{CV}+K_{CV})}{dt} = \\dot{Q}_{CS} - (-P_s) = \\dot{Q}_{CS} + P_s$. The input appears as a work term.\n\nNext, we consider the thermal energy balance: $\\frac{dU_{CV}}{dt} = \\dot{Q}_{CS} + \\int_{CV} \\Phi \\, dV$. The statement claims this can represent the same input. The assumption of \"neglecting accumulation of mechanical energy\" means we set $\\frac{dK_{CV}}{dt} = 0$. From the mechanical energy balance, this gives $P_s = \\int_{CV} \\Phi \\, dV$. Therefore, the thermal energy balance can be written as $\\frac{dU_{CV}}{dt} = \\dot{Q}_{CS} + P_s$. This demonstrates that the shaft power $P_s$, which is formally a work term in the total energy balance, appears as an internal energy source term in the thermal energy balance, with its magnitude equal to the rate of viscous dissipation $\\int_{CV} \\Phi \\, dV$. The statement is entirely accurate.\n\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\n**B. Under Case $3$, the shaft power appears as a boundary work transfer across the control surface in the First Law, because the impeller is inside the CV.**\n\nIn Case $3$, the CV encloses the liquid, impeller, and motor. The control surface is outside the motor and does not cut the shaft. Work is a boundary phenomenon; it is non-zero only if its agent crosses the boundary. Since the shaft is entirely internal to the CV, there is no shaft work transfer across the control surface, so $\\dot{W}_{\\text{shaft}} = 0$. The reason provided, \"because the impeller is inside the CV,\" is irrelevant to the calculation of work across the boundary.\n\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**C. Under Case $2$, there is no boundary work transfer associated with the shaft in the First Law for the CV, so the entire $P_{s}$ must be modeled as an internal generation term in the liquid’s thermal energy balance.**\n\nIn Case $2$, the CV contains the liquid and the impeller. The control surface cuts the rotating shaft. Therefore, the shaft performs work on the contents of the CV. This is a boundary work transfer. Specifically, $\\dot{W}_{CS} = -P_s$. The premise of the statement, \"there is no boundary work transfer,\" is false. While the ultimate effect on the thermal energy balance is an internal generation term, the reasoning provided is flawed.\n\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**D. Under Case $3$, no shaft work crosses the control surface; instead, the electrical power $\\dot{W}_{e}$ is the work input across the control surface in the First Law. The conversion of $\\dot{W}_{e}$ to mechanical power and its subsequent viscous dissipation both occur inside the CV, so in the liquid’s thermal energy balance the heating by agitation is treated as internal generation via $\\int_{CV}\\Phi\\,dV$.**\n\nIn Case $3$, as established for option B, the shaft does not cross the boundary, so there is no shaft work. Correct. Electrical leads cross the boundary, delivering power $\\dot{W}_e$. This is a work input. Correct. The motor, located inside the CV, converts this electrical power $\\dot{W}_e$ into mechanical shaft power $P_s$ and dissipated heat (motor losses). The shaft power $P_s$ is then dissipated by the impeller into the fluid via viscous effects. All these energy conversions occur *inside* the control volume. Correct.\n\nThe final part of the statement concerns \"the liquid's thermal energy balance.\" If we consider an energy balance on the liquid subdomain, the effect of the impeller's motion is to add energy via viscous dissipation. This is precisely the internal generation term $\\int_{CV, liquid} \\Phi \\, dV$. The magnitude of this term is equal to the shaft power $P_s$ delivered to the fluid (assuming steady operation). The statement correctly identifies the physical mechanism and its mathematical representation in the thermal energy balance for the liquid.\n\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\n**E. In any of Cases $1$–$3$, it is fundamentally incorrect to represent the agitation input as “internal heat generation” in a lumped thermal energy balance for the liquid; it must always be treated as boundary work in order not to violate the First Law.**\n\nThis statement is fundamentally incorrect. It conflates the *total energy balance* with the *thermal energy balance*. As derived in the preliminary analysis, the transformation from the total energy balance to the internal (thermal) energy balance explicitly converts the mechanical work input term into the viscous dissipation source term, $\\int \\Phi \\, dV$. This is a standard and rigorous procedure that does not violate the First Law; it is a direct consequence of it. The term $\\int \\Phi \\, dV$ is a volume integral source term, which is the definition of \"internal generation.\" To claim it must *always* be treated as boundary work is to ignore the distinction between the different forms of the energy balance.\n\n**Verdict: Incorrect**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{AD}$$", "id": "2486394"}]}
