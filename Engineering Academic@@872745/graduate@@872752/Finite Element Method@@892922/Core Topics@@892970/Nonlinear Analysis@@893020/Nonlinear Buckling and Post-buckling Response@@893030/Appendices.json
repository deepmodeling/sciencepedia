It is well-posed, providing all necessary information for a unique derivation. It is objective and presents a standard, albeit subtle, pedagogical problem concerning the kinematics of finite rotations. The displacement field provided, $u_x = -\\theta Y$ and $u_y = \\theta X$, is often presented as an infinitesimal rotation, and the problem correctly uses it to illustrate the consequences of applying such a simplification to a finite motion ($\\theta$ is finite) when using a nonlinear strain measure. This is a valid and important concept in nonlinear solid mechanics. The problem does not violate any of the criteria for invalidity.\n\nStep 3: Verdict.\nThe problem is valid. A solution will be provided.\n\nThe derivation begins with the fundamental kinematic relationships. The position vector of a material point in the reference configuration is $\\mathbf{X} = X\\mathbf{e}_x + Y\\mathbf{e}_y$. The displacement vector is given as $\\mathbf{u} = u_x\\mathbf{e}_x + u_y\\mathbf{e}_y = -\\theta Y\\mathbf{e}_x + \\theta X\\mathbf{e}_y$. The position vector in the current (deformed) configuration, $\\mathbf{x}$, is the sum of the reference position and the displacement:\n$$\n\\mathbf{x} = \\mathbf{X} + \\mathbf{u} = \\left(X - \\theta Y\\right)\\mathbf{e}_x + \\left(Y + \\theta X\\right)\\mathbf{e}_y\n$$\nThe components of the current position are $x_1 = X - \\theta Y$ and $x_2 = Y + \\theta X$.\n\nThe deformation gradient tensor, $\\mathbf{F}$, is defined by its components $F_{ij} = \\frac{\\partial x_i}{\\partial X_j}$. We compute these components:\n$$\nF_{11} = \\frac{\\partial x_1}{\\partial X} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial X}\\left(X - \\theta Y\\right) = 1\n$$\n$$\nF_{12} = \\frac{\\partial x_1}{\\partial Y} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial Y}\\left(X - \\theta Y\\right) = -\\theta\n$$\n$$\nF_{21} = \\frac{\\partial x_2}{\\partial X} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial X}\\left(Y + \\theta X\\right) = \\theta\n$$\n$$\nF_{22} = \\frac{\\partial x_2}{\\partial Y} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial Y}\\left(Y + \\theta X\\right) = 1\n$$\nIn matrix form, the deformation gradient is:\n$$\n\\mathbf{F} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1  -\\theta \\\\ \\theta  1 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nNext, we compute the right Cauchy–Green tensor, $\\mathbf{C} = \\mathbf{F}^{\\mathsf{T}}\\mathbf{F}$. The transpose of $\\mathbf{F}$ is $\\mathbf{F}^{\\mathsf{T}} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1  \\theta \\\\ -\\theta  1 \\end{pmatrix}$. The product is:\n$$\n\\mathbf{C} = \\mathbf{F}^{\\mathsf{T}}\\mathbf{F} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1  \\theta \\\\ -\\theta  1 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} 1  -\\theta \\\\ \\theta  1 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1\\cdot1 + \\theta\\cdot\\theta  1\\cdot(-\\theta) + \\theta\\cdot1 \\\\ -\\theta\\cdot1 + 1\\cdot\\theta  (-\\theta)\\cdot(-\\theta) + 1\\cdot1 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\n$$\n\\mathbf{C} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 + \\theta^2  0 \\\\ 0  1 + \\theta^2 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nFinally, we compute the Green–Lagrange strain tensor, $\\mathbf{E} = \\frac{1}{2}(\\mathbf{C} - \\mathbf{I})$, where $\\mathbf{I}$ is the second-order identity tensor.\n$$\n\\mathbf{E} = \\frac{1}{2} \\left( \\begin{pmatrix} 1 + \\theta^2  0 \\\\ 0  1 + \\theta^2 \\end{pmatrix} - \\begin{pmatrix} 1  0 \\\\ 0  1 \\end{pmatrix} \\right) = \\frac{1}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} \\theta^2  0 \\\\ 0  \\theta^2 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\n$$\n\\mathbf{E} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{1}{2}\\theta^2  0 \\\\ 0  \\frac{1}{2}\\theta^2 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nFrom this matrix, we identify the requested strain components:\n$E_{xx} = \\frac{1}{2}\\theta^2$\n$E_{yy} = \\frac{1}{2}\\theta^2$\n$E_{xy} = 0$\n\nNow, for the qualitative explanation. The strain tensor $\\mathbf{E}$ is non-zero, showing $E_{xx}  0$ and $E_{yy}  0$ for any $\\theta \\neq 0$. This indicates that the deformation is not a pure rigid-body motion. A true rigid-body motion must preserve the distance between any two material points, which requires that the right Cauchy-Green tensor $\\mathbf{C}$ be equal to the identity tensor $\\mathbf{I}$. If $\\mathbf{C} = \\mathbf{I}$, then $\\mathbf{E} = \\frac{1}{2}(\\mathbf{I} - \\mathbf{I}) = \\mathbf{0}$. Our calculation shows $\\mathbf{C} = (1+\\theta^2)\\mathbf{I}$, which signifies a uniform stretching occurring alongside the rotation.\n\nThe prescribed displacement field, $\\mathbf{u} = (-\\theta Y, \\theta X)$, is in fact a linearization of a true finite rotation, valid only for an infinitesimal angle $d\\theta$. A true finite rotation by angle $\\phi$ is given by the coordinate transformation $x = X\\cos\\phi - Y\\sin\\phi$ and $y = X\\sin\\phi + Y\\cos\\phi$. The corresponding displacement field is $u_x = X(\\cos\\phi - 1) - Y\\sin\\phi$ and $u_y = X\\sin\\phi + Y(\\cos\\phi - 1)$. For an infinitesimal angle $\\phi$, we use the approximations $\\sin\\phi \\approx \\phi$ and $\\cos\\phi \\approx 1 - \\frac{1}{2}\\phi^2$. The displacements become $u_x \\approx X(-\\frac{1}{2}\\phi^2) - Y\\phi$ and $u_y \\approx X\\phi + Y(-\\frac{1}{2}\\phi^2)$. The problem statement uses a displacement field that retains only the terms linear in the angle parameter, i.e., $u_x \\approx -Y\\theta$ and $u_y \\approx X\\theta$. This truncated description is incapable of satisfying the length-preservation condition for a finite rotation. The nonlinear terms in the expressions for $\\sin\\phi$ and $\\cos\\phi$ are precisely what is required to cancel the spurious strains introduced by the linear terms during a finite rotation. The Green-Lagrange tensor correctly detects the failure of this simplified kinematic description to represent a true rigid motion, producing non-zero strain components.\n\nThe implication for geometrically nonlinear finite element analysis, particularly for buckling and post-buckling problems where large rotations are inherent, is critical. Using simplified kinematic measures that are not objective (i.e., not invariant under rigid-body motion) will lead to the prediction of fictitious strains and stresses simply from large rotations. This phenomenon, known as \"membrane locking\" or artificial stiffening, results in an incorrect overestimation of the structural stiffness, leading to erroneous predictions of buckling loads and post-buckling behavior. Therefore, it is mandatory to employ nonlinear strain measures, such as the Green-Lagrange tensor, which are derived from a complete nonlinear kinematic framework. Such \"objective\" measures correctly yield zero strain for any rigid-body motion, ensuring that the computed stresses arise only from true physical deformation of the material.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{1}{2}\\theta^{2}  \\frac{1}{2}\\theta^{2}  0 \\end{pmatrix}}\n$$", "id": "2584373"}, {"introduction": "With a firm grasp of nonlinear kinematics, we can now investigate the core question of stability: at what load does a structure buckle?

We will find the critical buckling load by examining the second variation of the total potential energy.\n\nFirst, we define the geometry. The apex node, initially at $(0,h)$, moves to $(u, h-w)$. The fixed base nodes are at $(-a,0)$ and $(a,0)$. The lengths of the two bars, denoted bar $1$ (left) and bar $2$ (right), in the deformed configuration are given by the distance formula:\n$$ L_1(u,w) = \\sqrt{(u+a)^2 + (h-w)^2} $$\n$$ L_2(u,w) = \\sqrt{(u-a)^2 + (h-w)^2} $$\nThe initial length of each identical bar is $L_0 = \\sqrt{a^2 + h^2}$.

An equilibrium state $(u,w)$ is stable if $\\delta^2 \\Pi$ is positive definite for all admissible variations $(\\delta u, \\delta w)$. Bifurcation, or loss of stability, occurs when $\\delta^2 \\Pi$ ceases to be positive definite. Following the problem's convention, we define $\\delta^2 \\Pi$ as the quadratic form:\n$$ \\delta^2 \\Pi = \\frac{\\partial^2 \\Pi}{\\partial u^2} (\\delta u)^2 + 2 \\frac{\\partial^2 \\Pi}{\\partial u \\partial w} \\delta u \\delta w + \\frac{\\partial^2 \\Pi}{\\partial w^2} (\\delta w)^2 $$\nWe evaluate the coefficients of this form at a symmetric pre-buckling equilibrium point, which is characterized by $u=0$.\n\nFirst, we compute the required partial derivatives of $\\Pi$.

Lateral (asymmetric) buckling occurs when the stiffness against a lateral perturbation $\\delta u$ vanishes. This corresponds to the condition $H_{uu}=0$. The load at which this occurs is the critical load, $P_{\\mathrm{cr}}$.\n$$ H_{uu} = 2\\frac{E A}{L_0} \\frac{a^2}{L^2} - P_{\\mathrm{cr}}\\frac{h-w}{L^2} = 0 $$\nSolving for $P_{\\mathrm{cr}}$ gives the buckling condition:\n$$ P_{\\mathrm{cr}} = \\frac{2 E A a^2}{L_0 (h-w)} $$\n\nFor the final task, we determine $P_{\\mathrm{cr}}$ for the specific geometry $h = \\frac{\\sqrt{23}}{2} a$. We must solve for the state $(w, P_{\\mathrm{cr}})$ at buckling by using both the equilibrium equation and the buckling condition. Equating the two expressions for $P_{\\mathrm{cr}}$:\n$$ \\frac{2 E A a^2}{L_0 (h-w)} = -2 \\frac{E A}{L_0} (L - L_0) \\frac{h-w}{L} $$\nAssuming $E, A, L_0 \\neq 0$ and $h-w \\neq 0$, we simplify:\n$$ a^2 = -(L-L_0) \\frac{(h-w)^2}{L} \\implies a^2 L = (L_0-L)(h-w)^2 $$\n$$ L(a^2 + (h-w)^2) = L_0 (h-w)^2 $$\nLet $y=h-w$ be the current height of the apex. Since $L^2 = a^2+y^2$, this simplifies to a remarkably compact form:\n$$ L^3 = L_0 y^2 $$\nSubstituting the definitions $L=\\sqrt{a^2+y^2}$ and $L_0=\\sqrt{a^2+h^2}$:\n$$ (a^2+y^2)^{3/2} = \\sqrt{a^2+h^2} \\, y^2 $$\nSquaring both sides and letting $Y=y^2$:\n$$ (a^2+Y)^3 = (a^2+h^2) Y^2 $$\nExpanding the cubic term:\n$$ a^6 + 3a^4 Y + 3a^2 Y^2 + Y^3 = a^2 Y^2 + h^2 Y^2 $$\nRearranging into a polynomial for $Y$:\n$$ Y^3 + (2a^2 - h^2)Y^2 + 3a^4 Y + a^6 = 0 $$\nNow, we use the given geometry $h = \\frac{\\sqrt{23}}{2} a$, so $h^2 = \\frac{23}{4} a^2$.\n$$ Y^3 + (2a^2 - \\frac{23}{4}a^2)Y^2 + 3a^4 Y + a^6 = 0 $$\n$$ Y^3 - \\frac{15}{4}a^2 Y^2 + 3a^4 Y + a^6 = 0 $$\nThis is a homogeneous polynomial in $Y$ and $a^2$. We seek a solution $Y=Ca^2$. Substituting this gives a cubic equation for the constant $C$:\n$$ C^3 a^6 - \\frac{15}{4} C^2 a^6 + 3C a^6 + a^6 = 0 \\implies 4C^3 - 15C^2 + 12C + 4 = 0 $$\nBy inspection, $C=2$ is a root: $4(2)^3 - 15(2)^2 + 12(2) + 4 = 32 - 60 + 24 + 4 = 0$.\nThe polynomial can be factored as $(C-2)(4C^2 - 7C - 2) = 0$. The quadratic factor yields roots $C = \\frac{7 \\pm \\sqrt{49+32}}{8} = \\frac{7 \\pm 9}{8}$, so $C=2$ (a double root) and $C = -1/4$.\nSince $Y=y^2$ must be positive, $C$ must be positive. The only physically meaningful solution is $C=2$.\nThus, at buckling, $Y_{\\mathrm{cr}} = y_{\\mathrm{cr}}^2 = 2a^2$, which means the height of the apex is $y_{\\mathrm{cr}} = h-w_{\\mathrm{cr}} = \\sqrt{2}a$.\n\nFinally, we calculate $P_{\\mathrm{cr}}$ using the derived formula:\n$$ P_{\\mathrm{cr}} = \\frac{2 E A a^2}{L_0 y_{\\mathrm{cr}}} $$\nWe need $L_0$ for the given geometry: $L_0^2 = a^2 + h^2 = a^2 + \\frac{23}{4}a^2 = \\frac{27}{4}a^2$, so $L_0 = \\frac{3\\sqrt{3}}{2}a$.\nSubstituting the values of $L_0$ and $y_{\\mathrm{cr}}$:\n$$ P_{\\mathrm{cr}} = \\frac{2 E A a^2}{\\left(\\frac{3\\sqrt{3}}{2}a\\right) (\\sqrt{2}a)} = \\frac{2 E A a^2}{\\frac{3\\sqrt{6}}{2}a^2} = \\frac{4 E A}{3\\sqrt{6}} $$\nRationalizing the denominator gives the final analytical expression for the critical load:\n$$ P_{\\mathrm{cr}} = \\frac{4 E A}{3\\sqrt{6}} \\cdot \\frac{\\sqrt{6}}{\\sqrt{6}} = \\frac{4\\sqrt{6} E A}{18} = \\frac{2\\sqrt{6}}{9} E A $$\nThis expression has units of force.

Express this load in newtons, rounded to three digits after the decimal point.\n- Execute the described load-controlled Newton–Raphson procedure with a residual tolerance $\\varepsilon = 10^{-10}$ and a per-step iteration cap $N_{\\mathrm{it}}^{\\max} = 50$, starting from $u=0$ at $P=0$, and report how many load steps successfully converged before failure (or $N_{\\mathrm{steps}}$ if no failure occurs).\n\nRequired final output format:\nYour program should produce a single line of output containing a flat, comma-separated list enclosed in square brackets. The list must concatenate, in order, for each case, the triple\n$[\\text{count}, \\text{P\\_max\\_turn}, \\text{steps\\_converged}]$,\nwhere $\\text{count}$ is an integer, $\\text{P\\_max\\_turn}$ is a float with three digits after the decimal point (in newtons), and $\\text{steps\\_converged}$ is an integer. For the three cases in order, the final single-line output must therefore contain $9$ values arranged as\n$[\\text{c1},\\text{p1},\\text{s1},\\text{c2},\\text{p2},\\text{s2},\\text{c3},\\text{p3},\\text{s3}]$ with no additional text.", "solution": "The problem statement is validated as coherent, scientifically grounded, and well-posed. The analysis will proceed from the fundamental principle of stationary total potential energy to derive the equilibrium behavior and algorithmic response of the specified discrete system.\n\nThe total potential energy of the system is given as\n$$\\Pi(u;P) = U(u) - P\\,u,$$\nwhere the strain energy $U(u)$ is\n$$U(u) = \\tfrac{1}{2}k\\,u^{2} - \\tfrac{1}{4}\\alpha\\,u^{4} + \\tfrac{1}{6}\\beta\\,u^{6}.$$\nHere, $u$ is the generalized displacement, $P$ is the applied load, and $k, \\alpha, \\beta$ are positive material and geometric parameters.\n\n**Equilibrium Equation and Tangent Stiffness**\n\nThe condition for equilibrium is that the total potential energy is stationary with respect to the generalized coordinate $u$. This is expressed as the vanishing of the first derivative of $\\Pi$:\n$$\\frac{d\\Pi}{du} = \\frac{dU}{du} - P = 0.$$\nComputing the derivative of the strain energy $U(u)$ yields the internal force of the system, denoted as $P_{\\mathrm{int}}(u)$:\n$$P_{\\mathrm{int}}(u) = \\frac{dU}{du} = k\\,u - \\alpha\\,u^{3} + \\beta\\,u^{5}.$$\nAt equilibrium, the internal force must balance the external load $P$. This leads to the equilibrium path equation $P(u)$:\n$$P(u) = k\\,u - \\alpha\\,u^{3} + \\beta\\,u^{5}.$$\nFor numerical solution schemes such as the Newton-Raphson method, it is standard to formulate the equilibrium condition in residual form, $r(u;P) = 0$. The residual represents the force imbalance for a given state $(u,P)$:\n$$r(u;P) = P_{\\mathrm{int}}(u) - P = k\\,u - \\alpha\\,u^{3} + \\beta\\,u^{5} - P.$$\nThe Newton-Raphson method requires the linearization of the residual function, which involves its derivative with respect to the unknown displacement $u$. This derivative is the tangent stiffness, $K_T(u)$, which in this single-degree-of-freedom case is the scalar equivalent of the Jacobian matrix:\n$$K_T(u) = \\frac{dr}{du} = \\frac{dP_{\\mathrm{int}}(u)}{du} = \\frac{d^2U}{du^2}.$$\nCalculating this derivative gives the expression for the tangent stiffness:\n$$K_T(u) = k - 3\\alpha\\,u^{2} + 5\\beta\\,u^{4}.$$\n\n**Analysis of Turning Points**\n\nTurning points (limit points) on the load-displacement equilibrium path are locations where the load $P(u)$ attains a local extremum with respect to displacement $u$. Mathematically, this corresponds to the condition where the derivative of the load with respect to displacement is zero:\n$$\\frac{dP}{du} = 0.$$\nFrom the derivations above, we see that this condition is identical to the tangent stiffness being zero: $K_T(u) = 0$. Thus, the displacements at which turning points occur are the roots of the equation:\n$$5\\beta\\,u^{4} - 3\\alpha\\,u^{2} + k = 0.$$\nThis is a biquadratic equation. Let $x = u^2$. Since we are interested in real displacements $u$, we require real, positive solutions for $x$. The equation transforms into a quadratic equation in $x$:\n$$5\\beta\\,x^{2} - 3\\alpha\\,x + k = 0.$$\nThe solutions for $x$ are given by the quadratic formula:\n$$x = \\frac{3\\alpha \\pm \\sqrt{(3\\alpha)^2 - 4(5\\beta)(k)}}{2(5\\beta)} = \\frac{3\\alpha \\pm \\sqrt{9\\alpha^2 - 20k\\beta}}{10\\beta}.$$\nThe nature and number of real solutions for $u$ depend on the discriminant, $\\Delta = 9\\alpha^2 - 20k\\beta$.\n\n1.  If $\\Delta  0$ (i.e., $9\\alpha^2  20k\\beta$): There are no real solutions for $x$, and thus no turning points on the equilibrium path. The load-displacement curve is monotonic.\n2.  If $\\Delta = 0$ (i.e., $9\\alpha^2 = 20k\\beta$): There is one real solution for $x = \\frac{3\\alpha}{10\\beta}$. Since $k, \\alpha, \\beta$ are all positive, $x$ is positive. This yields one pair of symmetric solutions $u = \\pm\\sqrt{x}$, corresponding to one positive turning point.\n3.  If $\\Delta  0$ (i.e., $9\\alpha^2  20k\\beta$): There are two distinct real solutions for $x$. Since $\\sqrt{9\\alpha^2 - 20k\\beta}  \\sqrt{9\\alpha^2} = 3\\alpha$, both numerators $3\\alpha \\pm \\sqrt{\\Delta}$ are positive. As $\\beta  0$, both solutions $x_1$ and $x_2$ are positive. Each positive $x$ gives a pair of real solutions for $u$, leading to two distinct positive turning points.\n\n**Load-Controlled Newton-Raphson Procedure**\n\nThe task requires tracing the equilibrium path using a load-controlled incremental-iterative strategy. The total target load $P_{\\max}^{\\mathrm{tar}}$ is divided into $N_{\\mathrm{steps}}$ equal increments, $\\Delta P = P_{\\max}^{\\mathrm{tar}} / N_{\\mathrm{steps}}$. The procedure starts from the known equilibrium state $(u,P) = (0,0)$.\n\nFor each load step $i = 1, \\dots, N_{\\mathrm{steps}}$:\n1.  The target load is set to $P_i = i \\cdot \\Delta P$.\n2.  A Newton-Raphson iteration is initiated to find the corresponding equilibrium displacement $u_i$ that satisfies $r(u_i; P_i) = 0$.\n3.  The initial guess for the displacement at step $i$ is the converged solution from the previous step, $u_i^{(0)} = u_{i-1}$ (with $u_0 = 0$).\n4.  The iterative update proceeds as follows for iteration $j=0, 1, 2, \\dots$:\n    $$u_i^{(j+1)} = u_i^{(j)} - \\left[K_T(u_i^{(j)})\\right]^{-1} r(u_i^{(j)}; P_i).$$\n5.  The iteration continues until the norm of the residual is below a tolerance, $|r(u_i^{(j)}; P_i)|  \\varepsilon$, or until a maximum number of iterations, $N_{\\mathrm{it}}^{\\max}$, is reached.\n6.  If convergence is not achieved within $N_{\\mathrm{it}}^{\\max}$ iterations, the procedure terminates and reports failure.\n\n**Algorithmic Challenges of Load Control**\n\nThe load-controlled approach is simple but exhibits fundamental limitations when dealing with nonlinear responses involving turning points, such as snap-through or snap-back.\n\n1.  **Singularity at Limit Points:** As the equilibrium state $(u, P(u))$ approaches a turning point, the tangent stiffness $K_T(u)$ approaches zero. The Newton-Raphson correction, $\\Delta u = -r/K_T$, becomes unbounded. This leads to large, non-physical displacement updates, causing the iterative process to overshoot the solution, oscillate, and ultimately diverge. The algorithm fails to converge at or near a limit point.\n\n2.  **Inability to Traverse Turning Points:** Load control, by definition, prescribes a monotonically increasing sequence of load levels. However, to trace an equilibrium path beyond a maximum load point (snap-through) or a minimum load point (snap-back), the load parameter must decrease. A load-controlled scheme is algorithmically incapable of following such a path segment. When a load increment attempts to push the system to a load level for which no stable equilibrium exists on the current path branch (i.e., a load greater than a local maximum), the solver will fail to find a solution.\n\n3.  **Solution Multiplicity:** For loads between the maximum and minimum turning point values, multiple equilibrium displacements $u$ exist. The standard Newton-Raphson method, using the previous solution as an initial guess, will typically converge to the solution on the nearest continuous path segment. It has no mechanism to jump to other, possibly stable, equilibrium configurations. This is not the primary cause of failure at the limit point itself, but it highlights the complexity of the solution space that load control cannot explore.\n\nThese challenges demonstrate why load control is inadequate for analyzing complex post-buckling behavior. More robust path-following algorithms, such as arc-length methods (e.g., Riks or Crisfield methods), are required. These methods treat both the load and displacements as variables, adding a constraint equation on the \"length\" of the incremental step in the load-displacement space, which allows them to successfully navigate limit points.", "answer": "```python\n# The complete and runnable Python 3 code goes here.\n# Imports must adhere to the specified execution environment.\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves the problem for the three specified test cases.\n    For each case, it determines the number of turning points, the maximum load\n    at these points, and the number of successfully converged steps in a\n    load-controlled simulation.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    test_cases = [\n        # k, alpha, beta, P_max_tar, N_steps\n        (1000.0, 10.0, 1.0, 500.0, 50),\n        (100.0, 60.0, 5.0, 60.0, 50),\n        (22.5, 10.0, 2.0, 16.0, 40),\n    ]\n\n    # Algorithm parameters from problem statement\n    epsilon = 1e-10\n    n_it_max = 50\n\n    results = []\n    for case in test_cases:\n        k, alpha, beta, p_max_tar, n_steps = case\n        \n        # Task 1: Analyze turning points\n        count, p_max_turn = analyze_turning_points(k, alpha, beta)\n        \n        # Task 2: Run load-controlled Newton-Raphson simulation\n        steps_converged = run_load_control(k, alpha, beta, p_max_tar, n_steps, epsilon, n_it_max)\n        \n        results.append(count)\n        results.append(f\"{p_max_turn:.3f}\")\n        results.append(steps_converged)\n\n    print(f\"[{','.join(map(str, results))}]\")\n\ndef analyze_turning_points(k, alpha, beta):\n    \"\"\"\n    Determines the number of positive turning points and the maximum load at those points.\n    \n    A turning point occurs where the tangent stiffness K_T = 5*beta*u^4 - 3*alpha*u^2 + k is zero.\n    This is a quadratic equation in u^2.\n    \"\"\"\n    discriminant = (3 * alpha)**2 - 4 * (5 * beta) * k\n\n    if discriminant  0:\n        return 0, 0.0\n\n    # The problem specifies k, alpha, beta > 0.\n    # The term sqrt(9*alpha^2 - 20*k*beta) is always less than 3*alpha.\n    # Thus, if real solutions for u^2 exist, they must be positive.\n    \n    if discriminant == 0:\n        # One repeated positive root for u^2\n        u_sq = (3 * alpha) / (10 * beta)\n        u_tp = np.sqrt(u_sq)\n        p_tp = u_tp * (k - alpha * u_tp**2 + beta * u_tp**4)\n        return 1, p_tp\n    else: # discriminant > 0\n        # Two distinct positive roots for u^2\n        sqrt_disc = np.sqrt(discriminant)\n        u_sq1 = (3 * alpha - sqrt_disc) / (10 * beta)\n        u_sq2 = (3 * alpha + sqrt_disc) / (10 * beta)\n\n        u_tp1 = np.sqrt(u_sq1)\n        u_tp2 = np.sqrt(u_sq2)\n\n        p_tp1 = u_tp1 * (k - alpha * u_tp1**2 + beta * u_tp1**4)\n        p_tp2 = u_tp2 * (k - alpha * u_tp2**2 + beta * u_tp2**4)\n        \n        return 2, max(p_tp1, p_tp2)\n\ndef run_load_control(k, alpha, beta, p_max_tar, n_steps, tol, max_it):\n    \"\"\"\n    Performs an incremental-iterative analysis using load control and Newton-Raphson.\n    Returns the number of successfully converged load steps.\n    \"\"\"\n    delta_p = p_max_tar / n_steps\n    u_converged = 0.0  # Converged displacement from the previous step\n\n    for i in range(1, n_steps + 1):\n        p_target = i * delta_p\n        u_k = u_converged  # Initial guess for the current step (predictor)\n        \n        step_converged = False\n        for _ in range(max_it):\n            # Calculate residual force\n            residual = k * u_k - alpha * u_k**3 + beta * u_k**5 - p_target\n            \n            # Check for convergence\n            if abs(residual)  tol:\n                u_converged = u_k\n                step_converged = True\n                break\n            \n            # Calculate tangent stiffness\n            tangent = k - 3 * alpha * u_k**2 + 5 * beta * u_k**4\n            \n            # Check for singularity (a symptom of approaching a limit point)\n            if abs(tangent)  1e-12:\n                # Singular tangent, iteration will fail.
