We begin by adhering to the fundamental principles of the finite element method for isoparametric elements.\n\nThe geometry of the curved edge in the physical domain, denoted by the vector $\\mathbf{x} = (x, y)$, is interpolated from the nodal coordinates using the same shape functions that are used for interpolating a field variable. This is the essence of the isoparametric concept. For a quadratic Lagrange element with three nodes on the reference interval $\\xi \\in [-1, 1]$, the mapping is given by:\n$$ \\mathbf{x}(\\xi) = \\sum_{i=1,m,2} N_i(\\xi) \\mathbf{X}_i $$\nwhere $\\mathbf{X}_i$ are the physical coordinates of the nodes, and $N_i(\\xi)$ are the quadratic Lagrange shape functions. The nodes are located at $\\xi = -1$, $\\xi = 0$, and $\\xi = 1$.\n\nThe shape functions must satisfy the property $N_i(\\xi_j) = \\delta_{ij}$, where $\\delta_{ij}$ is the Kronecker delta. The three quadratic shape functions corresponding to nodes $1$ (at $\\xi=-1$), $m$ (at $\\xi=0$), and $2$ (at $\\xi=1$) are uniquely defined as:\n$$ N_1(\\xi) = \\frac{(\\xi-0)(\\xi-1)}{(-1-0)(-1-1)} = \\frac{1}{2}\\xi(\\xi-1) $$\n$$ N_m(\\xi) = \\frac{(\\xi-(-1))(\\xi-1)}{(0-(-1))(0-1)} = \\frac{(\\xi+1)(\\xi-1)}{-1} = 1-\\xi^2 $$\n$$ N_2(\\xi) = \\frac{(\\xi-(-1))(\\xi-0)}{(1-(-1))(1-0)} = \\frac{1}{2}\\xi(\\xi+1) $$\n\nThe problem provides the physical coordinates for these nodes: $\\mathbf{X}_1 = (0,0)$, $\\mathbf{X}_m = (1,1)$, and $\\mathbf{X}_2 = (2,0)$. We substitute these coordinates and the derived shape functions into the mapping equation:\n$$ \\mathbf{x}(\\xi) = N_1(\\xi)\\mathbf{X}_1 + N_m(\\xi)\\mathbf{X}_m + N_2(\\xi)\\mathbf{X}_2 $$\n$$ \\mathbf{x}(\\xi) = \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\xi(\\xi-1)\\right) \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix} + (1-\\xi^2) \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix} + \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\xi(\\xi+1)\\right) \\begin{pmatrix} 2 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix} $$\n\nWe can express the mapping in terms of its Cartesian components, $x(\\xi)$ and $y(\\xi)$:\n$$ x(\\xi) = 0 \\cdot N_1(\\xi) + 1 \\cdot N_m(\\xi) + 2 \\cdot N_2(\\xi) = (1-\\xi^2) + 2\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\xi(\\xi+1)\\right) = 1-\\xi^2 + \\xi^2 + \\xi = \\xi+1 $$\n$$ y(\\xi) = 0 \\cdot N_1(\\xi) + 1 \\cdot N_m(\\xi) + 0 \\cdot N_2(\\xi) = 1-\\xi^2 $$\nSo, the parametric representation of the curved edge is $\\mathbf{x}(\\xi) = (\\xi+1, 1-\\xi^2)$.\n\nThe Jacobian of the edge mapping, $J_e(\\xi)$, is defined as the magnitude (Euclidean norm) of the tangent vector $\\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{x}}{\\partial \\xi}$.

Since the integrand for a genuinely curved quadratic isoparametric element is a rational function, not a polynomial, no finite-order Gaussian quadrature rule can integrate it exactly. Exact integration would require a method capable of handling such rational functions, which is beyond the scope of standard polynomial-based Gaussian quadrature.
