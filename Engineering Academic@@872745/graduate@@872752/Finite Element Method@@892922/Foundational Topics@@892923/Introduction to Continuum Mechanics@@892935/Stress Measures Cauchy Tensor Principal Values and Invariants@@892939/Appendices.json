The problem is a standard exercise in continuum mechanics and linear algebra. It is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and contains all necessary information for a unique solution. We proceed with the solution.\n\nThe Cauchy stress tensor is given by the matrix:\n$$\n\\boldsymbol{\\sigma} = \\begin{pmatrix}\n2 & 1 & 0 \\\\\n1 & 2 & 1 \\\\\n0 & 1 & 2\n\\end{pmatrix} \\text{ MPa}\n$$\n\nPart 1: Characteristic Equation and Principal Invariants\n\nThe principal stresses, denoted by $\\lambda$, are the eigenvalues of the stress tensor $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}$. They are the roots of the characteristic equation $\\det(\\boldsymbol{\\sigma} - \\lambda \\boldsymbol{I}) = 0$, where $\\boldsymbol{I}$ is the $3 \\times 3$ identity matrix. For a general $3 \\times 3$ tensor, this equation is a cubic polynomial in $\\lambda$.\n\nIt is a fundamental result of tensor algebra that the characteristic equation can be expressed in terms of the principal invariants $I_1$, $I_2$, and $I_3$ as:\n$$\n\\lambda^3 - I_1 \\lambda^2 + I_2 \\lambda - I_3 = 0\n$$\nThis is known as the secular equation. The invariants are independent of the coordinate system. In a coordinate system aligned with the principal directions, the stress tensor is diagonal with the principal stresses $\\sigma_1, \\sigma_2, \\sigma_3$ as its entries. The invariants can be expressed in terms of these principal stresses as the elementary symmetric polynomials:\n$I_1 = \\sigma_1 + \\sigma_2 + \\sigma_3$\n$I_2 = \\sigma_1 \\sigma_2 + \\sigma_2 \\sigma_3 + \\sigma_3 \\sigma_1$\n$I_3 = \\sigma_1 \\sigma_2 \\sigma_3$\nThe characteristic polynomial in terms of its roots is $(\\lambda - \\sigma_1)(\\lambda - \\sigma_2)(\\lambda - \\sigma_3) = 0$. Expanding this product yields $\\lambda^3 - (\\sigma_1+\\sigma_2+\\sigma_3)\\lambda^2 + (\\sigma_1\\sigma_2+\\sigma_2\\sigma_3+\\sigma_3\\sigma_1)\\lambda - \\sigma_1\\sigma_2\\sigma_3 = 0$, which directly confirms the formulation $\\lambda^3 - I_1 \\lambda^2 + I_2 \\lambda - I_3 = 0$.\n\nWe now compute the invariants for the given tensor $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}$ using the definitions provided.\nThe first invariant, $I_1$, is the trace of $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}$:\n$$\nI_1 = \\operatorname{tr}(\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}) = 2 + 2 + 2 = 6\n$$\nThe third invariant, $I_3$, is the determinant of $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}$:\n$$\nI_3 = \\det(\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}) = 2\\begin{vmatrix} 2 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 2 \\end{vmatrix} - 1\\begin{vmatrix} 1 & 1 \\\\ 0 & 2 \\end{vmatrix} + 0 = 2(4-1) - 1(2-0) = 2(3) - 2 = 4\n$$\nThe second invariant, $I_2$, is given by $I_2 = \\frac{1}{2}[(\\operatorname{tr}\\boldsymbol{\\sigma})^2 - \\operatorname{tr}(\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}^2)]$.

We test for rational roots, which must be divisors of the constant term $4$. The possible rational roots are $\\pm 1, \\pm 2, \\pm 4$.\nLet $P(\\lambda) = \\lambda^3 - 6\\lambda^2 + 10\\lambda - 4$.\nFor $\\lambda=2$: $P(2) = 2^3 - 6(2^2) + 10(2) - 4 = 8 - 24 + 20 - 4 = 0$.\nSo, $\\lambda_2 = 2$ is a root.

An unnormalized eigenvector is $\\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ -\\sqrt{2} \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}$.\nThe norm is $\\sqrt{1^2 + (-\\sqrt{2})^2 + 1^2} = \\sqrt{1+2+1} = \\sqrt{4} = 2$.\nThe normalized principal direction is $\\boldsymbol{n}_3 = \\frac{1}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ -\\sqrt{2} \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{1}{2} \\\\ -\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2} \\\\ \\frac{1}{2} \\end{pmatrix}$.\n\nFinally, we verify orthonormality. The norms have already been shown to be unity.

Note that a symmetric central difference around a purely hydrostatic state yields a near-zero numerical gradient for $\\sigma_{\\mathrm{eq}}$.\n\nNumerical validation specification:\n\n- For each invariant $f \\in \\{I_1, J_2, \\sigma_{\\mathrm{eq}}\\}$ and each test case, compute the maximum absolute difference between the analytical and numerical six-component gradients, and report a boolean pass/fail using the criterion\n$$\n\\max_i |g_i^{\\text{analytical}} - g_i^{\\text{FD}}| \\le \\text{atol} + \\text{rtol} \\cdot \\max\\{1, \\max_i |g_i^{\\text{analytical}}|\\},\n$$\nwith absolute tolerance $\\text{atol} = 10^{-8}$ and relative tolerance $\\text{rtol} = 5 \\times 10^{-6}$.\n\nTest suite (use exactly these four symmetric Cauchy stress tensors):\n\n- Case A (general, mixed state):\n$$\n\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}_{A} =\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n120.5 & -35.2 & 12.0 \\\\\n-35.2 & 80.3 & 22.7 \\\\\n12.0 & 22.7 & -45.8\n\\end{bmatrix}.\n$$\n\n- Case B (pure hydrostatic):\n$$\n\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}_{B} = 50\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n1 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 1 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 1\n\\end{bmatrix}.\n$$\n\n- Case C (pure shear in the $xy$ plane):\n$$\n\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}_{C} =\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n0 & 75 & 0 \\\\\n75 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 0\n\\end{bmatrix}.\n$$\n\n- Case D (nearly hydrostatic with tiny deviatoric part):\n$$\n\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}_{D} = 50\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n1 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 1 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 1\n\\end{bmatrix}\n+\n10^{-8}\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n2 & 1 & -1 \\\\\n1 & -1 & 2 \\\\\n-1 & 2 & -1\n\\end{bmatrix}.\n$$\n\nRequired program behavior:\n\n- Implement the analytical gradients based solely on the definitions stated above.\n- Implement central-difference numerical gradients with symmetric perturbations for off-diagonals.\n- For each case and each invariant $(I_1, J_2, \\sigma_{\\mathrm{eq}})$, append a boolean indicating whether the validation criterion passes.\n- Your program should produce a single line of output containing the results as a comma-separated list enclosed in square brackets, in the order:\n  [CaseA_I1, CaseA_J2, CaseA_sigmaeq, CaseB_I1, CaseB_J2, CaseB_sigmaeq, CaseC_I1, CaseC_J2, CaseC_sigmaeq, CaseD_I1, CaseD_J2, CaseD_sigmaeq].", "solution": "The problem posed is a well-defined and standard task in continuum mechanics, specifically in the context of material modeling for finite element analysis. It requires the derivation of analytical gradients for common stress invariants and subsequent validation against a numerical approximation. All provided definitions and constraints are scientifically sound and internally consistent. The problem is valid.\n\nThe solution proceeds in two stages: first, the analytical derivation of the gradients from first principles, and second, the design of a numerical validation procedure.\n\n**1. Analytical Derivation of Gradients**\n\nWe are asked to find the gradient of the scalar functions $f(\\boldsymbol{\\sigma})$ of the symmetric Cauchy stress tensor $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}$. The gradient is defined as the tensor $\\boldsymbol{G} = \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial \\boldsymbol{\\sigma}}$ satisfying the relation $\\mathrm{d}f = \\boldsymbol{G} : \\mathrm{d}\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}$, where $:$ denotes the double contraction, i.e., $A_{ij}B_{ij}$. We use indicial notation with the Einstein summation convention.\n\n**1.1. Gradient of the First Invariant, $I_1$**\n\nThe first invariant is the trace of the stress tensor: $I_1 = \\mathrm{tr}(\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}) = \\sigma_{kk}$.\nIts differential is $\\mathrm{d}I_1 = \\mathrm{d}(\\sigma_{kk}) = \\delta_{ij} \\mathrm{d}\\sigma_{ij}$.\nIn tensor notation, this is $\\mathrm{d}I_1 = \\boldsymbol{I} : \\mathrm{d}\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}$, where $\\boldsymbol{I}$ is the second-order identity tensor.\nBy comparing this with the definition $\\mathrm{d}I_1 = \\frac{\\partial I_1}{\\partial \\boldsymbol{\\sigma}} : \\mathrm{d}\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}$, we identify the gradient as:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial I_1}{\\partial \\boldsymbol{\\sigma}} = \\boldsymbol{I}\n$$\n\n**1.2. Gradient of the Second Deviatoric Invariant, $J_2$**\n\nThe second invariant of the deviatoric stress is $J_2 = \\frac{1}{2} \\boldsymbol{s}:\\boldsymbol{s} = \\frac{1}{2} s_{ij}s_{ij}$, where $\\boldsymbol{s} = \\boldsymbol{\\sigma} - \\frac{1}{3}I_1\\boldsymbol{I}$.\nThe differential of $J_2$ is found using the product rule: $\\mathrm{d}J_2 = s_{ij} \\mathrm{d}s_{ij}$.\nThe differential of the deviatoric stress component $s_{ij}$ is:\n$$\n\\mathrm{d}s_{ij} = \\mathrm{d}\\left(\\sigma_{ij} - \\frac{1}{3}\\sigma_{kk}\\delta_{ij}\\right) = \\mathrm{d}\\sigma_{ij} - \\frac{1}{3}(\\mathrm{d}\\sigma_{kk})\\delta_{ij} = \\mathrm{d}\\sigma_{ij} - \\frac{1}{3}(\\mathrm{d}\\boldsymbol{\\sigma} : \\boldsymbol{I})\\delta_{ij}\n$$\nSubstituting this into the expression for $\\mathrm{d}J_2$:\n$$\n\\mathrm{d}J_2 = s_{ij}\\left(\\mathrm{d}\\sigma_{ij} - \\frac{1}{3}(\\mathrm{d}\\sigma_{kk})\\delta_{ij}\\right) = s_{ij}\\mathrm{d}\\sigma_{ij} - \\frac{1}{3}s_{ij}\\delta_{ij}(\\mathrm{d}\\sigma_{kk})\n$$\nThe term $s_{ij}\\delta_{ij}$ is the trace of the deviatoric stress, $\\mathrm{tr}(\\boldsymbol{s}) = \\mathrm{tr}(\\boldsymbol{\\sigma} - \\frac{1}{3}I_1\\boldsymbol{I}) = \\mathrm{tr}(\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}) - \\frac{1}{3}I_1\\mathrm{tr}(\\boldsymbol{I}) = I_1 - \\frac{1}{3}I_1(3) = 0$.\nTherefore, the second term vanishes, and we are left with $\\mathrm{d}J_2 = s_{ij}\\mathrm{d}\\sigma_{ij} = \\boldsymbol{s}:\\mathrm{d}\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}$.\nComparing with the definition $\\mathrm{d}J_2 = \\frac{\\partial J_2}{\\partial \\boldsymbol{\\sigma}} : \\mathrm{d}\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}$, we find:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial J_2}{\\partial \\boldsymbol{\\sigma}} = \\boldsymbol{s}\n$$\n\n**1.3. Gradient of the Von Mises Equivalent Stress, $\\sigma_{\\mathrm{eq}}$**\n\nThe von Mises stress is $\\sigma_{\\mathrm{eq}} = \\sqrt{3 J_2}$. We apply the chain rule for differentiation.\nFor $J_2 > 0$, and thus $\\sigma_{\\mathrm{eq}} > 0$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial \\sigma_{\\mathrm{eq}}}{\\partial \\boldsymbol{\\sigma}} = \\frac{\\partial \\sigma_{\\mathrm{eq}}}{\\partial J_2} \\frac{\\partial J_2}{\\partial \\boldsymbol{\\sigma}}\n$$\nThe scalar derivative is $\\frac{\\partial \\sigma_{\\mathrm{eq}}}{\\partial J_2} = \\frac{\\mathrm{d}}{\\mathrm{d}J_2}(3J_2)^{1/2} = \\frac{1}{2}(3J_2)^{-1/2} \\cdot 3 = \\frac{3}{2 \\sqrt{3J_2}} = \\frac{3}{2 \\sigma_{\\mathrm{eq}}}$.\nSubstituting this and the gradient of $J_2$ gives:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial \\sigma_{\\mathrm{eq}}}{\\partial \\boldsymbol{\\sigma}} = \\frac{3}{2 \\sigma_{\\mathrm{eq}}} \\boldsymbol{s} \\quad (\\text{for } \\sigma_{\\mathrm{eq}} > 0)\n$$\nFor hydrostatic stress states, $J_2 = 0$ and $\\boldsymbol{s}=\\boldsymbol{0}$. The expression becomes an indeterminate form $0/0$. The problem provides the standard convention for this singularity:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial \\sigma_{\\mathrm{eq}}}{\\partial \\boldsymbol{\\sigma}} = \\boldsymbol{0} \\quad (\\text{for } \\sigma_{\\mathrm{eq}} = 0)\n$$\n\n**2. Six-Component Gradient Vector**\n\nThe problem defines a six-component gradient vector $\\boldsymbol{g}(f)$ derived from the tensor gradient $\\boldsymbol{G} = \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial \\boldsymbol{\\sigma}}$ as $\\boldsymbol{g}(f) = [ G_{xx}, G_{yy}, G_{zz}, 2G_{xy}, 2G_{xz}, 2G_{yz} ]$. This relates the differential $\\mathrm{d}f$ to the perturbations in the six independent components of $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}$.\n\nUsing the analytical tensor gradients derived above, we obtain the following vector expressions:\n\n- For $f=I_1$, $\\boldsymbol{G} = \\boldsymbol{I}$. The components are $G_{11}=G_{22}=G_{33}=1$ and $G_{ij}=0$ for $i \\ne j$.\n  $$\n  \\boldsymbol{g}(I_1) = [1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0]\n  $$\n- For $f=J_2$, $\\boldsymbol{G} = \\boldsymbol{s}$. The components are $G_{ij} = s_{ij}$.\n  $$\n  \\boldsymbol{g}(J_2) = [s_{xx}, s_{yy}, s_{zz}, 2s_{xy}, 2s_{xz}, 2s_{yz}]\n  $$\n- For $f=\\sigma_{\\mathrm{eq}}$, $\\boldsymbol{G} = \\frac{3}{2 \\sigma_{\\mathrm{eq}}} \\boldsymbol{s}$ (if $\\sigma_{\\mathrm{eq}}>0$), and $\\boldsymbol{G}=\\boldsymbol{0}$ otherwise.\n  $$\n  \\boldsymbol{g}(\\sigma_{\\mathrm{eq}}) = \\frac{3}{2 \\sigma_{\\mathrm{eq}}} [s_{xx}, s_{yy}, s_{zz}, 2s_{xy}, 2s_{xz}, 2s_{yz}] = \\frac{3}{2 \\sigma_{\\mathrm{eq}}} \\boldsymbol{g}(J_2) \\quad (\\text{for } \\sigma_{\\mathrm{eq}} > 0)\n  $$\n  If $\\sigma_{\\mathrm{eq}}=0$, then $\\boldsymbol{g}(\\sigma_{\\mathrm{eq}}) = [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]$.\n\n**3. Numerical Validation Procedure**\n\nTo validate these analytical expressions, we compute a numerical gradient using the central finite difference method. The $k$-th component of the gradient vector $\\boldsymbol{g}(f)$ is approximated as:\n$$\ng_k^{\\text{FD}} = \\frac{f(\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}_k^+) - f(\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}_k^-)}{2h}\n$$\nHere, $h = 10^{-6} \\max\\{1, \\|\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}\\|_F\\}$ is the perturbation step size. The tensors $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}_k^{\\pm}$ are the stress tensor perturbed in its $k$-th independent component. The six independent components are ordered as $(\\sigma_{xx}, \\sigma_{yy}, \\sigma_{zz}, \\sigma_{xy}, \\sigma_{xz}, \\sigma_{yz})$.\n\n- For a diagonal component (e.g., $\\sigma_{xx}$, $k=1$): The perturbation is applied only to that component. For instance, $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}_1^{\\pm} = \\boldsymbol{\\sigma} \\pm h \\boldsymbol{E}_{11}$, where $\\boldsymbol{E}_{11}$ is a matrix with $1$ at the $(1,1)$ position and zeros elsewhere.\n- For an off-diagonal component (e.g., $\\sigma_{xy}$, $k=4$): To maintain the symmetry of the stress tensor, both $\\sigma_{xy}$ and $\\sigma_{yx}$ must be perturbed simultaneously. Thus, the perturbation is $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}_4^{\\pm} = \\boldsymbol{\\sigma} \\pm h(\\boldsymbol{E}_{12} + \\boldsymbol{E}_{21})$.\n\nThe final validation is performed by comparing the analytical gradient vector $\\boldsymbol{g}^{\\text{analytical}}$ with the numerical one $\\boldsymbol{g}^{\\text{FD}}$ using the specified tolerance criterion:\n$$\n\\max_k |g_k^{\\text{analytical}} - g_k^{\\text{FD}}| \\le \\mathrm{atol} + \\mathrm{rtol} \\cdot \\max\\{1, \\max_k |g_k^{\\text{analytical}}|\\}\n$$\nwith $\\mathrm{atol} = 10^{-8}$ and $\\mathrm{rtol} = 5 \\times 10^{-6}$.
