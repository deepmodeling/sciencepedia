It is a standard exercise in the field of finite element analysis. We proceed with the solution.\n\nThe problem requires, first, the derivation of integral formulas for products of barycentric coordinates over a triangle $T$. The fundamental principle is the transformation of an integral from the physical element $T$ with area $A$ to a canonical reference element $\\hat{T}$. This is achieved via an affine mapping. The relationship between the differential area elements is $dA = |J|d\\hat{A}$, where the Jacobian determinant is constant and equals $|J|=2A$.

This formula is a direct consequence of the properties of the Dirichlet integral, which is the multivariate generalization of the Beta function, evaluated over a simplex. Using this master formula, we derive the expressions for the required integrals.\n\nFirst, consider the integral $\\int_T L_i L_j \\, dA$.

For $M_{45}$, we use the shape functions for midside nodes $4$ and $5$:\n$$ N_4 = 4L_1 L_2 $$\n$$ N_5 = 4L_2 L_3 $$\nThe product of these shape functions is:\n$$ N_4 N_5 = (4L_1 L_2)(4L_2 L_3) = 16 L_1 L_2^2 L_3 $$\nThus, the mass matrix entry $M_{45}$ is given by the integral:\n$$ M_{45} = \\rho_s \\int_T 16 L_1 L_2^2 L_3 \\, dA = 16 \\rho_s \\int_T L_1 L_2^2 L_3 \\, dA $$\nThe integrand is a product of barycentric coordinates with exponents $(a,b,c) = (1,2,1)$.

All terms, such as the $T_6$ element, area coordinates, isoparametric mapping, and the element stiffness matrix, are defined according to standard literature. The distinction between an affine and a general quadratic mapping is a classic topic in FEM instruction. The problem is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. It contains no scientific fallacies, contradictions, or ambiguities. All necessary information is provided.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. I will proceed with the derivation of the solution.\n\nThe element stiffness matrix is given by:\n$$\nK_e = \\int_T B^{\\mathsf T} D B t \\, dA\n$$\nTo determine the required quadrature rule, we must find the polynomial degree of the integrand, which is the matrix-valued function $I = B^{\\mathsf T} D B t$. Since $D$ and $t$ are given as constant, the character of the integrand is determined by the term $B^{\\mathsf T} B$. The matrix $B$ is constructed from the spatial derivatives of the shape functions $N_i$. For a $2$D problem, the displacement field $(u,v)$ is interpolated as:\n$$\nu(x,y) = \\sum_{i=1}^{6} N_i u_i, \\quad v(x,y) = \\sum_{i=1}^{6} N_i v_i\n$$\nThe strain vector $\\epsilon = \\{\\epsilon_x, \\epsilon_y, \\gamma_{xy}\\}^{\\mathsf T}$ is related to displacements through derivatives:\n$$\n\\epsilon_x = \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x}, \\quad \\epsilon_y = \\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial y}, \\quad \\gamma_{xy} = \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial y} + \\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial x}\n$$\nThis leads to the strain-displacement matrix $B = [B_1, B_2, \\dots, B_6]$, where each sub-matrix $B_i$ is:\n$$\nB_i = \\begin{bmatrix} \\frac{\\partial N_i}{\\partial x}  0 \\\\ 0  \\frac{\\partial N_i}{\\partial y} \\\\ \\frac{\\partial N_i}{\\partial y}  \\frac{\\partial N_i}{\\partial x} \\end{bmatrix}\n$$\nThe shape functions $N_i$ for the $T_6$ element are quadratic polynomials in the area coordinates $(L_1, L_2, L_3)$. For example, for a corner node $i$, $N_i = L_i(2L_i - 1)$, and for a midside node $j$ between corners $k$ and $m$, $N_j = 4L_kL_m$. All $N_i$ are polynomials of degree $2$ in $L_1, L_2, L_3$.\n\n**Case I: Affine Geometry**\nIn this case, the element is straight-sided. The area coordinates $(L_1, L_2, L_3)$ are linear functions of the physical coordinates $(x,y)$:\n$$\nL_i(x,y) = a_i x + b_i y + c_i\n$$\nwhere $a_i, b_i, c_i$ are constants. Since the shape functions $N_i$ are quadratic polynomials in $L_j$, and $L_j$ are linear in $(x,y)$, the shape functions $N_i(x,y)$ become quadratic polynomials in the physical coordinates $(x,y)$.\nThe entries of the matrix $B_i$ are the spatial derivatives $\\frac{\\partial N_i}{\\partial x}$ and $\\frac{\\partial N_i}{\\partial y}$. The derivative of a quadratic polynomial is a linear polynomial. Therefore, every entry of the strain-displacement matrix $B$ is a linear polynomial in $x$ and $y$.\nThe integrand of the stiffness matrix contains the product $B^{\\mathsf T} B$. The entries of this product matrix are sums of products of the entries of $B$. A product of two linear polynomials results in a quadratic polynomial.\nThus, the integrand, $I(x,y) = B(x,y)^{\\mathsf T} D B(x,y) t$, is a matrix whose entries are polynomials of total degree at most $2$ in $x$ and $y$.\nTo integrate a polynomial of degree $p$ exactly over the triangular domain $T$, the quadrature rule must be polynomial-exact of degree at least $p$.\nTherefore, for Case I, the minimum required polynomial exactness degree is $2$.\n\n**Case II: Quadratic Isoparametric Geometry**\nIn this case, the geometry itself is mapped from a parent element (in, for instance, coordinates $(\\xi, \\eta)$ which are linearly related to any two area coordinates) using the same quadratic shape functions $N_i$:\n$$\nx(\\xi, \\eta) = \\sum_{i=1}^{6} N_i(\\xi, \\eta) x_i, \\quad y(\\xi, \\eta) = \\sum_{i=1}^{6} N_i(\\xi, \\eta) y_i\n$$\nThe integral for $K_e$ is transformed to the parent domain, let's call it $\\hat{T}$:\n$$\nK_e = \\int_{\\hat{T}} B^{\\mathsf T} D B t \\det(J) \\, d\\xi d\\eta\n$$\nwhere $J$ is the Jacobian matrix of the geometric mapping:\n$$\nJ = \\begin{bmatrix} \\frac{\\partial x}{\\partial \\xi}  \\frac{\\partial y}{\\partial \\xi} \\\\ \\frac{\\partial x}{\\partial \\eta}  \\frac{\\partial y}{\\partial \\eta} \\end{bmatrix}\n$$\nThe spatial derivatives required for the matrix $B$ are computed via the chain rule:\n$$\n\\begin{Bmatrix} \\frac{\\partial N_i}{\\partial x} \\\\ \\frac{\\partial N_i}{\\partial y} \\end{Bmatrix} = J^{-1} \\begin{Bmatrix} \\frac{\\partial N_i}{\\partial \\xi} \\\\ \\frac{\\partial N_i}{\\partial \\eta} \\end{Bmatrix}\n$$\nLet us analyze the polynomial degree of each term in the integrand with respect to the parent coordinates $(\\xi, \\eta)$.\n1.  The shape functions $N_i(\\xi, \\eta)$ are quadratic. Their derivatives, $\\frac{\\partial N_i}{\\partial \\xi}$ and $\\frac{\\partial N_i}{\\partial \\eta}$, are linear polynomials in $(\\xi, \\eta)$.\n2.  The mapping functions $x(\\xi, \\eta)$ and $y(\\xi, \\eta)$ are quadratic. Their derivatives with respect to $(\\xi, \\eta)$, which form the entries of $J$, are linear polynomials.\n3.  The determinant of the Jacobian, $\\det(J) = \\frac{\\partial x}{\\partial \\xi}\\frac{\\partial y}{\\partial \\eta} - \\frac{\\partial y}{\\partial \\xi}\\frac{\\partial x}{\\partial \\eta}$, is a product of two linear polynomials minus another such product. Thus, $\\det(J)$ is a quadratic polynomial in $(\\xi, \\eta)$.\n4.  The inverse of the Jacobian is $J^{-1} = \\frac{1}{\\det(J)} \\text{adj}(J)$, where $\\text{adj}(J)$ is the adjugate matrix of $J$. The entries of $\\text{adj}(J)$ are the entries of $J$ (with sign changes), which are linear polynomials. Therefore, the entries of $J^{-1}$ are rational functions: a linear polynomial in the numerator and a quadratic polynomial, $\\det(J)$, in the denominator.\n5.  The entries of matrix $B$ (e.g., $\\frac{\\partial N_i}{\\partial x}$) are computed by multiplying entries of $J^{-1}$ (rational functions) with derivatives $\\frac{\\partial N_i}{\\partial \\xi}$ (linear polynomials). The resulting entries of $B$ are rational functions of the form $\\frac{P_2(\\xi, \\eta)}{Q_2(\\xi, \\eta)}$, where $P_2$ and $Q_2$ are quadratic polynomials (specifically, $Q_2 = \\det(J)$).\n6.  The integrand in the parent domain is $I(\\xi, \\eta) = B(\\xi, \\eta)^{\\mathsf T} D B(\\xi, \\eta) t \\det(J)$. A typical entry in the matrix product $B^{\\mathsf T} B$ is a sum of terms like $b_{ki} b_{lj}$. Each such term is a product of two rational functions: $\\frac{P_2}{Q_2} \\times \\frac{R_2}{Q_2} = \\frac{P_2 R_2}{Q_2^2}$, which results in a rational function with a numerator of degree $4$ and a denominator of degree $4$. Let us represent a term in the integrand more precisely. Let $B = \\frac{1}{\\det(J)} \\tilde{B}$, where $\\tilde{B}$ now contains polynomial entries of degree $2$.\nThe integrand is:\n$$\n\\left(\\frac{1}{\\det(J)} \\tilde{B}\\right)^{\\mathsf T} D \\left(\\frac{1}{\\det(J)} \\tilde{B}\\right) t \\det(J) = \\frac{1}{(\\det(J))^2} \\tilde{B}^{\\mathsf T} D \\tilde{B} t \\det(J) = \\frac{\\tilde{B}^{\\mathsf T} D \\tilde{B} t}{\\det(J)}\n$$\nThe matrix $\\tilde{B}$ has entries which are polynomials of degree $2$ in $(\\xi, \\eta)$. The product $\\tilde{B}^{\\mathsf T} \\tilde{B}$ will thus have entries that are polynomials of degree $4$. So, the numerator $\\tilde{B}^{\\mathsf T} D \\tilde{B} t$ is a matrix of polynomials of degree $4$. The denominator is $\\det(J)$, a polynomial of degree $2$.\nThe integrand is a matrix of rational functions of the form $\\frac{P_4(\\xi, \\eta)}{P_2(\\xi, \\eta)}$. In general, such a rational function is not a polynomial. A quadrature rule designed for exact integration of polynomials cannot, in general, integrate such a function exactly, regardless of its polynomial degree $p$.\n\nTherefore, for Case II, no finite-degree polynomial-exact quadrature rule can guarantee exact integration of the stiffness matrix in the general case of a curved-sided element.\n\n**Evaluation of Options**\n\n*   **A.

The resulting matrix is diagonal, as expected for a lumped matrix.\n- If $i=j$, the summation has only one non-zero term, which occurs when $k=i$:\n$$ M_{ii} \\approx \\rho\\,t \\sum_{k=1}^{6} w_k \\delta_{ik} \\delta_{ik} = \\rho\\,t \\, w_i \\delta_{ii} \\delta_{ii} = \\rho\\,t\\,w_i $$\nThus, the diagonal entries of the lumped mass matrix are given by $M_{ii} = \\rho\\,t\\,w_i$.\n\nNow, we verify the two required properties using this relationship.\n\nProperty (i): Every diagonal entry is strictly positive ($M_{ii}  0$).\nSince $M_{ii} = \\rho\\,t\\,w_i$, and mass density $\\rho$ and thickness $t$ are positive physical quantities, this condition requires $w_i  0$. The problem statement specifies that the quadrature rule assigns a \"positive quadrature weight $w_a$ to each node\", so this condition is met by definition of the lumping procedure.\n\nProperty (ii): The sum of diagonal entries equals the total mass ($\\sum_{i=1}^{6} M_{ii} = \\rho\\,t\\,A$).\nLet us sum the diagonal entries:\n$$ \\sum_{i=1}^{6} M_{ii} = \\sum_{i=1}^{6} \\rho\\,t\\,w_i = \\rho\\,t \\sum_{i=1}^{6} w_i $$\nThe problem states that the quadrature weights are chosen such that $\\sum_{a=1}^{6} w_a = A$. Substituting this condition yields:\n$$ \\sum_{i=1}^{6} M_{ii} = \\rho\\,t\\,A $$\nThis condition is also met by the definition of the procedure.\n\nTherefore, any set of diagonal masses $M_{ii}$ derived from a nodal quadrature with positive weights $w_i$ that sum to $A$ will satisfy both properties. We now evaluate each given option against these two properties directly.\n\n**Option-by-Option Analysis**\n\n**A. $M_{ii}=\\rho\\,t\\,\\dfrac{A}{6}$ for each of the $6$ nodes.**\n- Property (i): Since $\\rho  0$, $t  0$, and $A  0$, the mass for each node $M_{ii} = \\rho\\,t\\frac{A}{6}$ is strictly positive. This property is satisfied.\n- Property (ii): The sum of the diagonal entries is:\n$$ \\sum_{i=1}^{6} M_{ii} = 6 \\times \\left( \\rho\\,t\\,\\frac{A}{6} \\right) = \\rho\\,t\\,A $$\nThis is equal to the total element mass. This property is satisfied.\n_Verdict_: **Correct**.\n\n**B. $M_{ii}=0$ for each of the $3$ vertex nodes and $M_{jj}=\\rho\\,t\\,\\dfrac{A}{3}$ for each of the $3$ midside nodes.**\n- Property (i): The mass assigned to the vertex nodes is $M_{ii} = 0$. This is not strictly positive. The problem demands that *every* diagonal entry be strictly positive. This property is violated.\n_Verdict_: **Incorrect**.\n\n**C. $M_{ii}=\\rho\\,t\\,\\dfrac{A}{12}$ for each of the $3$ vertex nodes and $M_{jj}=\\rho\\,t\\,\\dfrac{A}{4}$ for each of the $3$ midside nodes.**\n- Property (i): The masses for the vertex nodes are $\\rho\\,t\\frac{A}{12}  0$. The masses for the midside nodes are $\\rho\\,t\\frac{A}{4}  0$. All $6$ diagonal entries are strictly positive. This property is satisfied.\n- Property (ii): The sum of the diagonal entries is:\n$$ \\sum_{\\text{all}} M_{kk} = 3 \\times \\left( \\rho\\,t\\,\\frac{A}{12} \\right) + 3 \\times \\left( \\rho\\,t\\,\\frac{A}{4} \\right) $$\n$$ = \\rho\\,t \\left( \\frac{3A}{12} + \\frac{3A}{4} \\right) = \\rho\\,t \\left( \\frac{A}{4} + \\frac{3A}{4} \\right) = \\rho\\,t \\left( \\frac{4A}{4} \\right) = \\rho\\,t\\,A $$\nThis is equal to the total element mass. This property is satisfied.\n_Verdict_: **Correct**. This lumping scheme corresponds to quadrature weights of $w_{\\text{vertex}} = A/12$ and $w_{\\text{midside}} = A/4$. All weights are positive, and their sum is $3(A/12) + 3(A/4) = A$.\n\n**D. $M_{ii}=\\rho\\,t\\,\\dfrac{A}{3}$ for each of the $3$ vertex nodes and $M_{jj}=-\\,\\rho\\,t\\,\\dfrac{A}{12}$ for each of the $3$ midside nodes.**\n- Property (i): The mass assigned to the midside nodes is $M_{jj} = -\\rho\\,t\\frac{A}{12}$, which is negative. This violates the condition that every diagonal entry must be strictly positive. Negative mass is also physically nonsensical. This property is violated.\n- Property (ii): Let us check the sum for completeness.\n$$ \\sum_{\\text{all}} M_{kk} = 3 \\times \\left( \\rho\\,t\\,\\frac{A}{3} \\right) + 3 \\times \\left( -\\rho\\,t\\,\\frac{A}{12} \\right) $$\n$$ = \\rho\\,t\\,A - \\rho\\,t\\,\\frac{3A}{12} = \\rho\\,t\\,A - \\rho\\,t\\,\\frac{A}{4} = \\frac{3}{4}\\rho\\,t\\,A $$\nThe sum is not equal to the total mass $\\rho\\,t\\,A$. This property is also violated.\n_Verdict_: **Incorrect**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{AC}$$", "id": "2608129"}]}
