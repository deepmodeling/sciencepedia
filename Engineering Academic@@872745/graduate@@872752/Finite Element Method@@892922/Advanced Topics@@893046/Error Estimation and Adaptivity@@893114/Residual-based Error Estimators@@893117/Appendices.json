It provides all necessary information to determine the finite element solution and the resulting residual.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. I will proceed with a full solution.\n\nThe finite element space $V_h$ for the given mesh has nodes at $x_0=0$, $x_1=\\tfrac{1}{2}$, and $x_2=1$. Due to the homogeneous Dirichlet conditions $u_h(0)=u_h(1)=0$, the space $V_h$ is one-dimensional, spanned by a single basis function, the \"hat\" function $\\phi_1(x)$ centered at the interior node $x_1=\\tfrac{1}{2}$. This basis function is defined as:\n$$\n\\phi_1(x) = \\begin{cases} 2x & \\text{if } x \\in [0, \\tfrac{1}{2}] \\\\ 2(1-x) & \\text{if } x \\in [\\tfrac{1}{2}, 1] \\\\ 0 & \\text{otherwise} \\end{cases}\n$$\nThe finite element solution $u_h(x)$ can be written as $u_h(x) = c_1 \\phi_1(x)$, where $c_1$ is a scalar coefficient to be determined. The Galerkin condition requires testing against all functions in $V_h$, which is satisfied by testing against the basis function $\\phi_1(x)$.\n$$\n\\int_{0}^{1} (c_1 \\phi_1(x))' (\\phi_1(x))' dx = \\int_{0}^{1} f(x) \\phi_1(x) dx\n$$\nThis simplifies to a linear equation for $c_1$:\n$$\nc_1 \\left( \\int_{0}^{1} |\\phi_1'(x)|^2 dx \\right) = \\int_{0}^{1} f(x) \\phi_1(x) dx\n$$\nWe compute the integrals. The derivative of the basis function is:\n$$\n\\phi_1'(x) = \\begin{cases} 2 & \\text{if } x \\in (0, \\tfrac{1}{2}) \\\\ -2 & \\text{if } x \\in (\\tfrac{1}{2}, 1) \\end{cases}\n$$\nThe integral on the left-hand side is:\n$$\n\\int_{0}^{1} |\\phi_1'(x)|^2 dx = \\int_{0}^{1/2} (2)^2 dx + \\int_{1/2}^{1} (-2)^2 dx = 4 \\cdot \\frac{1}{2} + 4 \\cdot \\frac{1}{2} = 4\n$$\nThe integral on the right-hand side is:\n$$\n\\int_{0}^{1} f(x) \\phi_1(x) dx = \\int_{0}^{1} (2 + \\sin(2\\pi x)) \\phi_1(x) dx = \\int_{0}^{1} 2\\phi_1(x) dx + \\int_{0}^{1} \\sin(2\\pi x) \\phi_1(x) dx\n$$\nThe first term is $2\\int_{0}^{1} \\phi_1(x) dx$. The integral $\\int_{0}^{1} \\phi_1(x) dx$ represents the area of the triangle defined by $\\phi_1(x)$, which has a base of length 1 and a height of 1. This area is $\\tfrac{1}{2} \\cdot 1 \\cdot 1 = \\tfrac{1}{2}$. Thus, the term evaluates to $2 \\times \\tfrac{1}{2} = 1$.\nThe second term is zero due to symmetry. The function $\\phi_1(x)$ is even with respect to $x=\\tfrac{1}{2}$, while the function $\\sin(2\\pi x)$ is odd with respect to $x=\\tfrac{1}{2}$ (since $\\sin(2\\pi(\\tfrac{1}{2}-z)) = \\sin(\\pi - 2\\pi z) = \\sin(2\\pi z)$ and $\\sin(2\\pi(\\tfrac{1}{2}+z)) = \\sin(\\pi + 2\\pi z) = -\\sin(2\\pi z)$). The integral of their product over the interval $[0,1]$, which is symmetric about $x=1/2$, is zero.\nTherefore, the right-hand side integral evaluates to $1$.\n\nThe equation for $c_1$ becomes $4c_1 = 1$, which gives $c_1 = \\tfrac{1}{4}$. The finite element solution is:\n$$\nu_h(x) = \\frac{1}{4} \\phi_1(x) = \\begin{cases} \\frac{1}{2}x & \\text{if } x \\in [0, \\tfrac{1}{2}] \\\\ \\frac{1}{2}(1-x) & \\text{if } x \\in [\\tfrac{1}{2}, 1] \\end{cases}\n$$\nNow we address the first task: computing the strong element residual $r_K(x) = f(x) + u_h''(x)$.\nThe function $u_h(x)$ is linear on the interior of each element $K \\in \\{K_{1}, K_{2}\\}$. Consequently, its second derivative $u_h''(x)$ is identically zero for all $x \\in K_1 \\cup K_2$.\n$$\nu_h''(x) = 0 \\quad \\text{for } x \\in (0,\\tfrac{1}{2}) \\cup (\\tfrac{1}{2},1)\n$$\nThus, the strong element residual on the interior of each element is simply the forcing function $f(x)$:\n$$\nr_K(x) = f(x) + 0 = 2 + \\sin(2\\pi x) \\quad \\text{for } x \\in K\n$$\nThis result is valid for both $K_1 = (0,\\tfrac{1}{2})$ and $K_2 = (\\tfrac{1}{2},1)$. This completes the first task.\n\nNext, we address the second task: determining the scaling of $\\|r_K\\|_{L^{\\infty}(K)}$ with a variable element length $h_K$.\nFrom the previous step, we have established that for any element $K$ in any mesh, the strong element residual for a piecewise linear approximation is given by $r_K(x) = f(x)$ for $x \\in K$. The magnitude in the $L^{\\infty}(K)$-norm is therefore:\n$$\n\\|r_K\\|_{L^{\\infty}(K)} = \\sup_{x \\in K} |r_K(x)| = \\sup_{x \\in K} |f(x)|\n$$\nWe are asked how this quantity scales as the element size $h_K$ tends to zero. Let us consider a sequence of meshes where $h_K \\to 0$. For any element $K$ in such a mesh, let $x_K$ be a point in $K$. As $h_K \\to 0$, the interval $K$ shrinks to a point. Since the forcing function $f(x) = 2 + \\sin(2\\pi x)$ is continuous everywhere, the supremum of $|f(x)|$ over a shrinking interval $K$ converges to the value of $|f|$ at the limit point.\n$$\n\\lim_{h_K \\to 0} \\|r_K\\|_{L^{\\infty}(K)} = \\lim_{h_K \\to 0} \\sup_{x \\in K} |f(x)| = |f(x^*)|\n$$\nwhere $x^*$ is the point to which the element $K$ contracts.\nIn general, for any non-zero point $x^*$, $|f(x^*)|$ is a positive constant. For our specific $f(x)$, $|f(x)| \\ge 2 - 1 = 1$ for all $x$. A quantity that converges to a non-zero constant as a parameter $h_K$ goes to zero is said to be of order zero with respect to that parameter. This can be written as $O(h_K^0)$, or simply $O(1)$.\nThe scaling law is therefore of the form $C \\cdot h_K^{\\alpha}$ with $\\alpha=0$. The monomial expressing this dependence is $h_K^0$. This reflects the fundamental property that for piecewise linear elements, the strong interior residual does not converge to zero in the $L^{\\infty}$-norm; it simply becomes the local value of the source term.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{h_{K}^{0}}$$", "id": "2594006"}, {"introduction": "Beyond the interior of elements, error estimators must also account for how well the numerical solution satisfies the boundary conditions.

This contribution, which we shall denote as $\\eta_N$, is defined as the magnitude of the boundary residual, $R_N$, multiplied by the square root of the length of the adjacent element, $h$. Specifically, for the last element $K_2 = (x_1, x_2)$, its length is $h_2 = x_2 - x_1$. The boundary contribution at $x=x_2=1$ is thus $\\eta_N = |R_N| h_2^{1/2}$.\n\nThe boundary residual $R_N$ at $x=1$ is defined as the mismatch between the imposed flux and the discrete flux. The imposed flux is given by the Neumann boundary condition, $A(1)u'(1)=g$. The discrete flux, derived from the finite element solution $u_h$, is $A(1)u_h'(1)$. Therefore, the residual is:\n$$R_N = g - A(1)u_h'(1)$$\nWe shall now compute the components of this expression.\n\nFirst, we determine the derivative of the finite element approximation, $u_h'(1)$. The function $u_h$ is continuous and piecewise linear. On the last element, $K_2 = (x_1, x_2) = (0.35, 1)$, its derivative is constant and equal to the slope of the line segment connecting the points $(x_1, u_h(x_1))$ and $(x_2, u_h(x_2))$. The given nodal values are $u_h(0.35)=0.09$ and $u_h(1)=0.46$.\nThe derivative on this element is:\n$$u_h'(x) = \\frac{u_h(x_2) - u_h(x_1)}{x_2 - x_1} = \\frac{0.46 - 0.09}{1 - 0.35} = \\frac{0.37}{0.65}$$\nTo work with exact fractions, we write this as:\n$$u_h'(1) = \\frac{37/100}{65/100} = \\frac{37}{65}$$\nThe notation $u_h'(1)$ signifies the derivative of $u_h$ on the element adjacent to the boundary point $x=1$.\n\nSecond, we evaluate the diffusion coefficient $A(x)$ at the boundary point $x=1$.

Taking the constant $C_R=1$:\nOn $K_1$: $h_{K_1}=\\frac{1}{2}$, $u_h''(x)=-\\frac{1}{4}$. The residual is $R_{K_1} = x - \\frac{1}{4}$.\n$\\eta_{K_1}^2 = (\\frac{1}{2})^2 \\int_0^{1/2} (x-\\frac{1}{4})^2 dx = \\frac{1}{4} \\left[ \\frac{(x-1/4)^3}{3} \\right]_0^{1/2} = \\frac{1}{12} \\left[ (\\frac{1}{4})^3 - (-\\frac{1}{4})^3 \\right] = \\frac{1}{12} \\left( \\frac{2}{64} \\right) = \\frac{1}{384}$.\nOn $K_2$: $h_{K_2}=\\frac{1}{2}$, $u_h''(x)=-\\frac{3}{4}$.

Taking $C_J=1$, the single interior node is at $x_i = \\frac{1}{2}$. The local length scale is $h_{1/2} = (h_{K_1}+h_{K_2})/2 = \\frac{1}{2}$.\nThe jump is $[u_h'](\\frac{1}{2}) = u_h'|_{K_2}(\\frac{1}{2}) - u_h'|_{K_1}(\\frac{1}{2})$.\n$u_h'(x)$ on $K_1$ is $\\frac{3}{16} - \\frac{x}{4}$, so $u_h'(\\frac{1}{2}^-) = \\frac{3}{16} - \\frac{1}{8} = \\frac{1}{16}$.\n$u_h'(x)$ on $K_2$ is $\\frac{7}{16} - \\frac{3x}{4}$, so $u_h'(\\frac{1}{2}^+) = \\frac{7}{16} - \\frac{3}{8} = \\frac{1}{16}$.\nThe jump $[u_h'](\\frac{1}{2}) = \\frac{1}{16} - \\frac{1}{16} = 0$. This is a known superconvergence property for quadratic elements on a uniform mesh with a linear source term.\nSo, $\\eta_{1/2}^2 = 0$.\n\nThe global estimator is $\\eta^2 = \\eta_{K_1}^2 + \\eta_{K_2}^2 + \\eta_{1/2}^2 = \\frac{1}{384} + \\frac{1}{384} + 0 = \\frac{2}{384} = \\frac{1}{192}$.\nThus, $\\eta = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{192}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{64 \\cdot 3}} = \\frac{1}{8\\sqrt{3}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{24}$.\n\nThe true energy error is $\\|e\\|_E = \\|u-u_h\\|_E$.
