The data provided are physically consistent and complete for the prescribed estimation method. For example, the values for $E$ and $\\nu$ are typical for steel. The problem is not trivial, as it requires deriving the appropriate modulus for the given conditions. It does not contain contradictions or fallacies.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is deemed valid. A solution will be formulated based on the provided instructions.\n\nThe penalty formulation relates the normal contact traction $t_n$ to the penetration $g_n$ through the penalty parameter $\\epsilon$:\n$$t_n = \\epsilon g_n$$\nTo limit the maximum penetration to a value $g_{\\max}$, the traction at this penetration will be $t_{n, \\max} = \\epsilon g_{\\max}$.\n\nThe problem provides a crucial, non-standard directive for estimation: \"Assume that a representative contact traction scale is set by the local normal stiffness times the imposed displacement.\" We denote the local normal stiffness per unit area as $k_{loc}$ and the imposed punch displacement as $\\Delta$. This directive is expressed as:\n$$t_{n, \\text{rep}} = k_{loc} \\Delta$$\nTo ensure the penetration does not exceed $g_{\\max}$, we equate this representative traction with the maximum allowable traction, $t_{n, \\max}$.\n$$t_{n, \\text{rep}} = t_{n, \\max}$$\n$$k_{loc} \\Delta = \\epsilon g_{\\max}$$\nThis equation allows us to solve for the required penalty parameter $\\epsilon$:\n$$\\epsilon = \\frac{k_{loc} \\Delta}{g_{\\max}}$$\nThe next step is to determine the local stiffness $k_{loc}$. The problem instructs us to model this stiffness as arising from the compressive deformation of a column of material of height $h$. The stiffness $k_{loc}$ is the ratio of the normal stress (traction) to the normal displacement that generates it. For a column of height $h$, the compressive strain is $\\varepsilon_{yy} = \\delta_y / h$, where $\\delta_y$ is the compression. The corresponding normal stress is $\\sigma_{yy} = M \\varepsilon_{yy}$, where $M$ is the appropriate modulus. The stiffness is therefore:\n$$k_{loc} = \\frac{\\sigma_{yy}}{\\delta_y} = \\frac{M \\varepsilon_{yy}}{\\varepsilon_{yy} h} = \\frac{M}{h}$$\nThe problem is set in plane strain. The analogy of compressing a column implies a state of uniaxial strain in the vertical direction ($y$-direction), as the surrounding material constrains lateral expansion. Thus, we have $\\varepsilon_{yy} \\neq 0$, but $\\varepsilon_{xx} = 0$. By definition of plane strain, we also have $\\varepsilon_{zz} = 0$.

The stress component $\\sigma_{yy}$ is:\n$$\\sigma_{yy} = \\lambda \\varepsilon_{yy} + 2\\mu \\varepsilon_{yy} = (\\lambda + 2\\mu) \\varepsilon_{yy}$$\nThe effective modulus is $M = \\lambda + 2\\mu$, which is the P-wave modulus.

The tangent stiffness matrix for the sliding regime is:\n$$ \\mathbf{K}_{\\mathrm{alg}} = S \\cdot \\mathbf{P} $$\nwhere $S = \\frac{k_t \\mu R_n}{\\|\\mathbf{t}_t^{\\mathrm{tr}}\\|}$ is a scalar factor and $\\mathbf{P} = \\left( \\mathbf{I} - \\frac{\\mathbf{t}_t^{\\mathrm{tr}} (\\mathbf{t}_t^{\\mathrm{tr}})^T}{\\|\\mathbf{t}_t^{\\mathrm{tr}}\\|^2} \\right)$ is a projection matrix. The matrix $\\mathbf{P}$ projects vectors onto the direction perpendicular to the trial force $\\mathbf{t}_t^{\\mathrm{tr}}$. As a rank-1 projection matrix in a 2D space, its eigenvalues are $1$ and $0$.\nThe eigenvalues of $\\mathbf{K}_{\\mathrm{alg}}$ are therefore the eigenvalues of $\\mathbf{P}$ scaled by the factor $S$.\nThe eigenvalues of $\\mathbf{K}_{\\mathrm{alg}}$ are $\\lambda_1 = S \\times 1 = S$ and $\\lambda_2 = S \\times 0 = 0$.\nThe largest eigenvalue is $\\lambda_{\\max} = S$.\n\nLet us compute the value of $S$:\n$$ S = \\frac{k_t \\mu R_n}{\\|\\mathbf{t}_t^{\\mathrm{tr}}\\|} = \\frac{(4.0 \\times 10^{4}) \\times 360}{200\\sqrt{5}} = \\frac{1.44 \\times 10^7}{200\\sqrt{5}} = \\frac{72000}{\\sqrt{5}} \\text{ N/m} $$\nNumerically, this value is:\n$$ S \\approx \\frac{72000}{2.2360679...} \\approx 32200.75 \\text{ N/m} $$\nThe problem requires rounding the answer to four significant figures.\n$$ \\lambda_{\\max} \\approx 32200 \\text{ N/m} $$\nIn standard scientific notation this is $3.220 \\times 10^4$ N/m.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{3.220 \\times 10^{4}}$$", "id": "2586601"}]}
