Therefore, it is natural to represent $p_h(x)$ using the master-side shape functions $N_1(x)=1-x$ and $N_2(x)=x$:\n$$\np_h^{\\mathrm{N2S}}(x) = c_1 N_1(x) + c_2 N_2(x)\n$$\nwhere $c_1$ and $c_2$ are the nodal traction values at the master nodes ($x=0$ and $x=1$).\nUsing the results from the slave node evaluation:\nAt $x=0$: $p_h^{\\mathrm{N2S}}(0) = c_1 N_1(0) + c_2 N_2(0) = c_1$.

The discrete traction field is $p_h^{\\mathrm{S2S}}(x)=1$ for all $x \\in [0,1]$. This is because the space of trial functions (piecewise constants) contains the exact solution (a constant). The projection of the exact solution onto this space is the solution itself. The error is:\n$$\nE(p_h^{\\mathrm{S2S}}) = \\left(\\int_{0}^{1}(1-1)^{2}\\,\\mathrm{d}x\\right)^{1/2} = 0\n$$\n\n**3) Mortar Method**\n\nThe problem states that the mortar discretization \"preserves constants\". This is a fundamental property of well-formulated mortar methods, ensuring they pass the patch test for constant fields. Formally, it means that for a constant traction field $p(x) = p_0$, the corresponding discrete traction field $p_h^{\\mathrm{M}}(x)$ is exactly $p_0$.\nLet's confirm why this must be the case. The method seeks $p_h^{\\mathrm{M}}$ in a space of multiplier functions $M_h$ such that for all test functions $w_h$ in the master space $W_h = \\text{span}\\{N_1, N_2\\}$, the following holds:\n$$\n\\int_0^1 p_h^{\\mathrm{M}}(x) w_h(x) dx = \\int_0^1 p_0 w_h(x) dx\n$$\nA constant-preserving method requires that the constant function itself is an element of the multiplier space $M_h$. If $p_0 \\in M_h$, then setting $p_h^{\\mathrm{M}}(x) = p_0$ trivially satisfies the weak form:\n$$\n\\int_0^1 p_0 w_h(x) dx = \\int_0^1 p_0 w_h(x) dx\n$$\nAssuming the method is well-posed (i.e., the solution is unique), this must be the solution. Hence, $p_h^{\\mathrm{M}}(x) = p_0$ (or $1$ in our case).\nTherefore, the discrete traction field is $p_h^{\\mathrm{M}}(x) = 1$. The error is:\n$$\nE(p_h^{\\mathrm{M}}) = \\left(\\int_{0}^{1}(1-1)^{2}\\,\\mathrm{d}x\\right)^{1/2} = 0\n$$\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nAll three specified contact discretizations pass the traction patch test for a constant pressure field, meaning they reproduce the exact constant solution perfectly. The normalized $L^2$ error for each method is zero.\n$$\nE(p_{h}^{\\mathrm{N2S}}) = 0\n$$\n$$\nE(p_{h}^{\\mathrm{S2S}}) = 0\n$$\n$$\nE(p_{h}^{\\mathrm{M}}) = 0\n$$\nThe maximum of these errors is therefore also zero.\n$$\nE_{\\max} = \\max\\{0, 0, 0\\} = 0\n$$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0}$$", "id": "2584061"}, {"introduction": "Real-world engineering problems rarely involve perfectly flat contact surfaces, making the analysis of curved interfaces essential.

It is self-contained, scientifically grounded, and admits a unique, meaningful solution. We shall proceed with its formal derivation.\n\nThe problem is divided into two parts. First, we must determine the order of the pointwise geometric gap error resulting from the isoparametric approximation of the master boundary. Second, we must use this result within a Strang-type error estimate to derive the final convergence rate for the displacement field in the V-norm, or energy norm.\n\nLet us begin with the first task: the quantification of the geometric gap error.\nThe geometric gap error is defined as $e_{g}(x) := g_{n}(x) - g_{n,h}(x)$. The problem states that in the reference configuration, the exact normal gap $g_{n}(x)$ is zero for all points $x$ on the slave boundary $\\Gamma_{s}$. This implies that in this specific configuration, $\\Gamma_{s}$ is a subset of the master boundary $\\Gamma_{m}$. The gap error therefore simplifies to $e_{g}(x) = -g_{n,h}(x)$.\n\nThe computed gap $g_{n,h}(x)$ is defined as the projection of the vector connecting a point $x \\in \\Gamma_{s}$ to its closest-point projection on the approximate master boundary, $p_{\\Gamma_{m,h}}(x)$, onto the slave normal $\\boldsymbol{n}_{s}(x)$. That is, $g_{n,h}(x) := \\boldsymbol{n}_{s}(x) \\cdot \\left(p_{\\Gamma_{m,h}}(x) - x\\right)$.\nConsequently, the geometric error is $e_{g}(x) = - \\boldsymbol{n}_{s}(x) \\cdot \\left(p_{\\Gamma_{m,h}}(x) - x\\right)$.\n\nTo find the pointwise bound $\\|e_{g}\\|_{L^{\\infty}(\\Gamma_{s})}$, we take the absolute value and apply the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality in $\\mathbb{R}^{2}$:\n$$\n|e_{g}(x)| = |\\boldsymbol{n}_{s}(x) \\cdot \\left(p_{\\Gamma_{m,h}}(x) - x\\right)| \\le \\|\\boldsymbol{n}_{s}(x)\\| \\, \\|p_{\\Gamma_{m,h}}(x) - x\\|\n$$\nBy definition, $\\boldsymbol{n}_{s}(x)$ is a unit normal vector, so its Euclidean norm $\\|\\boldsymbol{n}_{s}(x)\\|$ is equal to $1$. This simplifies the inequality to:\n$$\n|e_{g}(x)| \\le \\|p_{\\Gamma_{m,h}}(x) - x\\|\n$$\nThe term $\\|p_{\\Gamma_{m,h}}(x) - x\\|$ is the Euclidean distance from the point $x$ to the approximate boundary $\\Gamma_{m,h}$. Since $x \\in \\Gamma_{s}$ and $\\Gamma_{s} \\subseteq \\Gamma_{m}$, $x$ is a point on the exact master boundary $\\Gamma_{m}$. Thus, $\\|p_{\\Gamma_{m,h}}(x) - x\\|$ is the distance from a point on the exact boundary to the approximate boundary.\n\nStandard results from the theory of isoparametric finite element approximation of boundaries state that for a boundary $\\Gamma_m$ of class $C^{N}$ (here $N=3$) approximated by a piecewise polynomial curve $\\Gamma_{m,h}$ of degree $r_g$ on a quasiuniform mesh of size $h$, the pointwise distance between the two curves is of order $h^{r_g+1}$, provided $N \\ge r_g+1$. The condition given, $\\Gamma_m \\in C^3$, is sufficient for typical element degrees (e.g., $r_g=1, 2$). The Hausdorff distance $d_{H}(\\Gamma_{m}, \\Gamma_{m,h})$ is bounded by $C h^{r_g+1}$, which implies:\n$$\n\\sup_{x \\in \\Gamma_{m}} \\|x - p_{\\Gamma_{m,h}}(x)\\| \\le C h^{r_{g}+1}\n$$\nfor a constant $C$ independent of $h$. Since $\\Gamma_s \\subseteq \\Gamma_m$, this bound holds for all $x \\in \\Gamma_s$. Therefore, we have $|e_g(x)| \\le C h^{r_g+1}$ for all $x \\in \\Gamma_s$. Taking the supremum over $\\Gamma_s$, we conclude the first part of the problem:\n$$\n\\|e_{g}\\|_{L^{\\infty}(\\Gamma_{s})} = \\mathcal{O}(h^{r_{g}+1})\n$$\n\nNow, we proceed to the second task: deriving the convergence rate exponent $s(k_{u}, r_{g})$.\nThe analysis of finite element methods involving 'variational crimes', such as the geometric approximation in this contact problem, is classically performed using the Second Strang Lemma or its generalizations for variational inequalities. The total error in the energy norm is bounded by the sum of two terms: the best-approximation error and the consistency error.\n$$\n\\|u - u_{h}\\|_{V} \\le C \\left( \\inf_{v_{h} \\in V_{h}} \\|u - v_{h}\\|_{V} + \\sup_{w_{h} \\in V_{h}, \\|w_{h}\\|_{V}=1} |R_{h}(w_{h})| \\right)\n$$\nHere, $u$ is the exact solution, $u_h$ is the discrete solution, $V_h$ is the finite element space for displacements, and $R_h$ is the consistency residual functional.\n\nThe first term is the best-approximation error. The problem states that the displacement field is approximated by elements of degree $k_u$ and that the exact solution $u$ possesses sufficient regularity, such that the best-approximation error in the energy norm has the optimal rate:\n$$\n\\inf_{v_{h} \\in V_{h}} \\|u - v_{h}\\|_{V} = \\mathcal{O}(h^{k_{u}})\n$$\nThe second term represents the consistency error arising from the geometric approximation of the contact boundary.

Thus, the order of the $L^2$-norm of the error is the same as the order of the $L^{\\infty}$-norm:\n$$\n\\|e_{g}\\|_{L^{2}(\\Gamma_{s})} = \\mathcal{O}(h^{r_{g}+1})\n$$\nThe consistency error term is therefore of order $\\mathcal{O}(h^{r_{g}+1})$.\n\nCombining the two error contributions, the total error estimate becomes:\n$$\n\\|u - u_{h}\\|_{V} \\le C_{1} h^{k_{u}} + C_{2} h^{r_{g}+1}\n$$\nThe asymptotic convergence rate as $h \\to 0$ is governed by the slower of the two terms, which corresponds to the smaller exponent. Therefore, the overall error is $\\mathcal{O}(h^{s(k_{u}, r_{g})})$, where the exponent $s$ is the minimum of the two exponents:\n$$\ns(k_{u}, r_{g}) = \\min(k_{u}, r_{g}+1)\n$$\nThis result illustrates a fundamental principle in the finite element analysis of contact problems: the accuracy of the geometric approximation can become a bottleneck for the overall accuracy of the solution. To preserve the optimal convergence rate of a higher-order displacement approximation (degree $k_u$), the geometric approximation must be of a sufficiently high degree $r_g$ such that $r_g+1 \\ge k_u$.

Assume small deformations of the slave side and that the master is perfectly rigid, so only $\\mathbf{x}_s$ changes during the solution.\n\nA common implementation computes a closest-point mapping by projecting $\\mathbf{x}_s$ onto a single smooth parametric patch of the master and uses the unique unit normal $\\mathbf{n}(\\mathbf{y})$ at the closest point $\\mathbf{y} \\in \\Gamma_M$ to define $g(\\mathbf{x}_s) = \\mathbf{n}(\\mathbf{y}) \\cdot (\\mathbf{x}_s - \\mathbf{y})$. However, near edges and corners of $\\Gamma_M$, the smooth-patch assumption fails: the projection may lie on an edge shared by multiple facets or at a vertex, and the normal direction becomes non-unique, which can lead to non-physical jumps, loss of convergence, or incorrect active-set decisions when solving the KKT system with Newton-type methods.\n\nStarting from first principles, use the definition of the closest point as a minimizer of Euclidean distance,\n$$\n\\mathbf{y}^\\star(\\mathbf{x}_s) \\in \\arg\\min_{\\mathbf{y} \\in \\Gamma_M} \\|\\mathbf{x}_s - \\mathbf{y}\\|,\n$$\nand the fact that for a polyhedral $\\Gamma_M$ the normal is uniquely defined on the relative interior of a facet but is set-valued on edges and vertices (normal cone), to analyze failure cases of the closest-point mapping near edges/corners and to propose a robust, variationally consistent, and Newton-friendly procedure based on facet-wise search with fallback projections.\n\nWhich of the following statements correctly identify failure mechanisms and specify a robust procedure that preserves the inequality constraint in the sense of variational inequalities and allows a consistent linearization for Newton or semismooth Newton methods?\n\nA. Perform a facet-wise orthogonal projection: for each candidate triangular facet, compute the orthogonal projection of $\\mathbf{x}_s$ onto the facet’s plane and its barycentric coordinates; accept the projected point if the barycentric coordinates are all nonnegative (interior). If not, orthogonally project onto each of the facet’s edges; if the edge projection lies outside the segment, take the nearest endpoint (vertex). Build a set of candidate points across all neighboring facets, edges, and vertices discovered by a broad-phase search, and select $\\mathbf{y}^\\star$ as the candidate with minimal Euclidean distance to $\\mathbf{x}_s$. This eliminates reliance on a single smooth parameterization and resolves edge/corner projection without ambiguity in the location of $\\mathbf{y}^\\star$.\n\nB. To avoid normal non-uniqueness at edges, freeze the normal to that of the previously active facet and disallow facet switching; i.e., always project onto the last-contacted facet even if the closest point migrates to an adjacent facet. This ensures continuity of the normal and guarantees variational consistency of the nonpenetration constraint.\n\nC. When $\\mathbf{y}^\\star$ lies on an edge or a vertex, define the admissible set of contact normals by the normal cone $N_{\\Gamma_M}(\\mathbf{y}^\\star)$, equivalently the convex cone spanned by the adjacent facet normals $\\{\\mathbf{n}_i\\}$. Enforce the unilateral contact either as a single inequality in an unknown normal $\\mathbf{n} \\in N_{\\Gamma_M}(\\mathbf{y}^\\star)$ or, equivalently, as multiple facet-wise inequalities $g_i(\\mathbf{x}_s)=\\mathbf{n}_i \\cdot (\\mathbf{x}_s-\\mathbf{y}^\\star) \\ge 0$ with one Lagrange multiplier $\\lambda_i \\ge 0$ per adjacent facet and complementarity $\\lambda_i g_i(\\mathbf{x}_s)=0$, together with a consistent semismooth Newton linearization using a Clarke generalized derivative. This yields a well-posed direction of constraint at edges/corners consistent with variational inequalities.\n\nD. Replace the polyhedral surface by a globally smoothed signed distance field obtained by fitting a $C^2$ spline through the mesh, and always use the gradient of this field as the contact normal. This guarantees a unique normal at edges/corners and preserves the exact nonpenetration constraint for the original polyhedral geometry.\n\nE. For robustness in Newton iterations, hold the contact classification (interior-to-facet, on-edge, at-vertex) and the associated active set fixed within an inner Newton linearization and update them only between outer iterations, switching classification only if a trial step violates the current classification beyond a small trust-region threshold. This produces a consistent tangent operator across iterations and prevents oscillations due to instantaneous switching near edges/corners.\n\nSelect all that apply.", "solution": "The user requires an analysis of procedures for handling frictionless unilateral contact with a rigid polyhedral body in the context of the finite element method. The core of the problem lies in the non-smooth nature of the master surface $\\Gamma_M$, which leads to a non-unique contact normal at edges and vertices. This invalidates simple contact formulations that assume a smooth surface and causes numerical difficulties for Newton-type solvers. A robust procedure must correctly identify the closest point of contact, formulate the non-penetration constraint in a variationally consistent manner, and be amenable to a robust numerical solver.\n\nThe problem statement has been validated and is found to be scientifically sound, well-posed, and free of any invalidating flaws. It presents a standard, yet advanced, topic in computational contact mechanics. We will proceed with a solution based on first principles.\n\nThe state of the system is governed by the principle of minimum potential energy, subject to the non-penetration constraint $g(\\mathbf{x}_s) \\ge 0$. The constraint is enforced using a Lagrange multiplier $\\lambda$, which represents the magnitude of the contact normal force. The Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions provide the complete formulation:\n$$ g(\\mathbf{x}_s) \\ge 0, \\quad \\lambda \\ge 0, \\quad \\lambda\\, g(\\mathbf{x}_s) = 0 $$\nHere, $g(\\mathbf{x}_s)$ is the gap function. For a general point $\\mathbf{x}_s$, the closest point $\\mathbf{y}^\\star$ on the master surface $\\Gamma_M$ is the solution to a minimization problem:\n$$ \\mathbf{y}^\\star(\\mathbf{x}_s) \\in \\arg\\min_{\\mathbf{y} \\in \\Gamma_M} \\|\\mathbf{x}_s - \\mathbf{y}\\| $$\nThe gap vector is then $\\mathbf{g} = \\mathbf{x}_s - \\mathbf{y}^\\star$. From the theory of projection onto convex sets (or, in this case, the boundary of a convex set), the gap vector must lie in the normal cone to $\\Gamma_M$ at $\\mathbf{y}^\\star$, i.e., $\\mathbf{x}_s - \\mathbf{y}^\\star \\in N_{\\Gamma_M}(\\mathbf{y}^\\star)$. The contact force vector, which acts in the opposite direction, must therefore be in the negative of the normal cone, which is the standard direction for a repulsive contact force. The gap function $g(\\mathbf{x}_s)$ is the signed distance, typically defined as $g(\\mathbf{x}_s) = \\mathbf{n} \\cdot (\\mathbf{x}_s - \\mathbf{y}^\\star)$, where $\\mathbf{n}$ is the contact normal. The core difficulty is that the normal cone, and thus the direction $\\mathbf{n}$, is not a single vector at edges and vertices.\n\nA robust method must therefore consist of three main components:\n$1$. A robust geometric algorithm to find the unique closest point $\\mathbf{y}^\\star$.\n$2$. A variationally consistent formulation of the contact constraint and force at $\\mathbf{y}^\\star$, especially when it lies on a non-smooth feature.\n$3$. A stable numerical scheme (e.g., a modified Newton method) to solve the resulting non-smooth, nonlinear system of equations.\n\nWe now evaluate each option against these principles.\n\n**Option A Analysis**\nThis option describes a detailed geometric algorithm for finding the closest point $\\mathbf{y}^\\star$ on a triangulated surface. The procedure involves:\n$1$. Projecting $\\mathbf{x}_s$ orthogonally onto the plane of a triangle.\n$2$. Checking if the projection lies inside the triangle using barycentric coordinates.\n$3$. If not, projecting onto the triangle's edges (which are line segments).\n$4$. If the projection is outside an edge segment, selecting the closest vertex.\n$5$. Repeating for all candidate facets and choosing the point that gives the absolute minimum distance.\n\nThis hierarchical projection method (plane $\\to$ edge $\\to$ vertex) is a standard and mathematically sound way to implement the $\\arg\\min$ operator for a polyhedral mesh. It correctly finds the unique location of $\\mathbf{y}^\\star$ without ambiguity, thus resolving the geometric part of the problem that arises from naive smooth-patch assumptions. It correctly identifies a failure mechanism (reliance on single smooth parameterization) and provides a robust procedure for the geometric search. This is an essential first step in any robust contact algorithm for polyhedral bodies.\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\n**Option B Analysis**\nThis option suggests \"freezing\" the contact normal, using the normal of the previously active facet when the closest point moves to an edge or a new facet. The stated goal is to ensure continuity of the normal vector. While this does make the normal vector continuous in time or across iterations, it is fundamentally inconsistent with the physics and variational principles of contact. The contact force must be normal to the constraint surface at the *current* point of contact. By using an \"old\" normal, the resulting contact force vector $\\mathbf{F}_c = -\\lambda \\mathbf{n}_{\\text{old}}$ may not be in the admissible set of directions (the normal cone) at the current contact point $\\mathbf{y}^\\star$. This can lead to the force vector having a component that pulls the node *into* the rigid body along an adjacent facet, violating the non-penetration constraint it is supposed to enforce. This is a non-physical, ad-hoc fix that sacrifices accuracy and variational consistency for numerical convenience.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**Option C Analysis**\nThis option addresses the central issue of the non-unique normal at edges and vertices. It correctly identifies the normal cone, $N_{\\Gamma_M}(\\mathbf{y}^\\star)$, as the set of all possible directions for the vector $(\\mathbf{x}_s - \\mathbf{y}^\\star)$. At an edge, this cone is spanned by the normals of the two adjacent facets, $\\{\\mathbf{n}_1, \\mathbf{n}_2\\}$. At a vertex, it is spanned by the normals of all facets meeting there, $\\{\\mathbf{n}_i\\}$. The option proposes enforcing the contact constraint as a set of multiple inequalities, one for each facet $i$ defining the feature:\n$$ g_i(\\mathbf{x}_s) = \\mathbf{n}_i \\cdot (\\mathbf{x}_s - \\mathbf{y}^\\star) \\ge 0 $$\nEach inequality is paired with its own non-negative Lagrange multiplier $\\lambda_i \\ge 0$ and a complementarity condition $\\lambda_i g_i = 0$. The total contact force is then effectively a positive linear combination of the facet normals, which is precisely a vector in the normal cone. This is the correct, variationally consistent way to formulate the problem. Furthermore, it correctly points to the use of a semismooth Newton method with a Clarke generalized derivative to solve the resulting non-smooth KKT system. This approach transforms the non-differentiable problem into one that can be solved with robust, rapidly converging numerical methods.\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\n**Option D Analysis**\nThis option suggests replacing the exact polyhedral geometry with a globally smooth $C^2$ approximation, such as a spline-based signed distance field. The benefit is that the gradient of this field provides a unique, continuously varying normal everywhere. However, the critical flaw in this option is the claim that it \"preserves the exact nonpenetration constraint for the original polyhedral geometry.\" This is a contradiction. A smooth surface cannot be identical to a polyhedral surface containing sharp edges and corners. Smoothing an edge either \"rounds it off\", which would permit penetration of the original sharp corner, or \"pads it out\", which would create an artificial gap and prevent contact where it should occur on the original surface. Therefore, this method does not solve the stated problem but rather replaces it with a different, approximated problem.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**Option E Analysis**\nThis option addresses the numerical solution of the KKT system, which is a key part of a \"Newton-friendly\" procedure. When a slave node's position is near an edge or vertex, a small change in its position during a Newton iteration can cause the closest point classification to \"flicker\" between adjacent facets or between a facet and an edge. This leads to drastic changes in the system's tangent stiffness matrix, which can cause oscillations (zig-zagging) and failure of the Newton-Raphson method to converge. The proposed strategy is to \"[hold] the contact classification... fixed within an inner Newton linearization and update them only between outer iterations.\" This is a description of a robust active-set strategy. By freezing the set of active constraints for a series of \"inner\" Newton iterations, the solver works on a locally smooth problem and can converge robustly. The \"outer\" loop then updates the contact state (the active set) based on the result, and a new inner loop begins. This prevents the solver from getting stuck in oscillations and is a standard technique for improving the robustness and convergence of contact algorithms.\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\nIn summary, Options A, C, and E describe correct and complementary components of a complete, robust, and modern algorithm for handling polyhedral contact. Option A covers the geometric search, Option C covers the variationally consistent formulation, and Option E covers the robust numerical solution strategy.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{ACE}$$", "id": "2572507"}]}
