Consider anti-plane shear (Mode III) deformation with out-of-plane displacement $u(r,\\theta)$ governed by the Laplace equation $\\nabla^2 u = 0$ in the wedge, with no body forces. This anti-plane shear setting is a canonical local model for stress computation near geometric singularities and is widely used to construct local singular enrichment for the extended finite element method (XFEM).

It is a standard problem in linear elasticity and fracture mechanics. We proceed with the solution.\n\nThe governing equation for the out-of-plane displacement $u(r, \\theta)$ in the anti-plane shear case is the two-dimensional Laplace equation, $\\nabla^2 u = 0$. In polar coordinates $(r, \\theta)$, this equation is expressed as:\n$$ \\frac{1}{r} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial r} \\left( r \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial r} \\right) + \\frac{1}{r^2} \\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial \\theta^2} = 0 $$\nWe seek a non-trivial solution using the method of separation of variables. We assume the displacement field has the form $u(r, \\theta) = F(r)G(\\theta)$. Substituting this into the Laplace equation yields:\n$$ \\frac{1}{r} G(\\theta) \\frac{d}{d r} \\left( r \\frac{dF}{d r} \\right) + \\frac{1}{r^2} F(r) \\frac{d^2 G}{d \\theta^2} = 0 $$\nMultiplying by $\\frac{r^2}{F(r)G(\\theta)}$ allows for the separation of the variables:\n$$ \\frac{r}{F(r)} \\frac{d}{d r} \\left( r \\frac{dF}{d r} \\right) = - \\frac{1}{G(\\theta)} \\frac{d^2 G}{d \\theta^2} $$\nThe left side is a function of $r$ only, while the right side is a function of $\\theta$ only. For this equality to hold for all $r$ and $\\theta$ in the domain, both sides must be equal to a constant. Let us denote this separation constant as $k$.\nThis leads to two ordinary differential equations:\n1.  Angular part: $\\frac{d^2 G}{d \\theta^2} + k G(\\theta) = 0$\n2.  Radial part: $r \\frac{d}{d r} \\left( r \\frac{dF}{d r} \\right) - k F(r) = 0$, which can be expanded to $r^2 \\frac{d^2 F}{d r^2} + r \\frac{dF}{d r} - k F(r) = 0$.\n\nLet us first analyze the angular equation. The boundary conditions are given as $u(r, 0) = 0$ and $u(r, \\omega) = 0$. For a non-trivial solution where $F(r) \\not\\equiv 0$, these conditions must be satisfied by the angular function $G(\\theta)$, so we have $G(0) = 0$ and $G(\\omega) = 0$.\nThe general solution of $G''(\\theta) + k G(\\theta) = 0$ depends on the sign of $k$.\nIf $k = 0$, the solution is $G(\\theta) = A \\theta + B$. The condition $G(0) = 0$ implies $B=0$. The condition $G(\\omega) = 0$ implies $A \\omega = 0$, which means $A=0$ since $\\omega > 0$. This gives the trivial solution $G(\\theta) = 0$, which is not of interest.\nIf $k  0$, let $k = -\\lambda^2$ where $\\lambda > 0$. The solution is $G(\\theta) = A \\sinh(\\lambda \\theta) + B \\cosh(\\lambda \\theta)$. The condition $G(0) = 0$ implies $B=0$. The condition $G(\\omega) = 0$ implies $A \\sinh(\\lambda \\omega) = 0$. Since $\\lambda > 0$ and $\\omega > 0$, $\\sinh(\\lambda \\omega) \\neq 0$, so we must have $A=0$. Again, this leads to the trivial solution.\nIf $k > 0$, let $k = \\lambda^2$ where $\\lambda > 0$. The general solution is $G(\\theta) = A \\sin(\\lambda \\theta) + B \\cos(\\lambda \\theta)$.\nApplying the boundary condition $G(0) = 0$:\n$G(0) = A \\sin(0) + B \\cos(0) = B = 0$.\nThe solution must be of the form $G(\\theta) = A \\sin(\\lambda \\theta)$.\nApplying the second boundary condition $G(\\omega) = 0$:\n$G(\\omega) = A \\sin(\\lambda \\omega) = 0$.\nFor a non-trivial solution, we need $A \\neq 0$. This requires that $\\sin(\\lambda \\omega) = 0$. This condition is met when $\\lambda \\omega$ is an integer multiple of $\\pi$.\n$$ \\lambda \\omega = n \\pi, \\quad \\text{for } n \\in \\mathbb{Z} $$\nThis gives the admissible values for the parameter $\\lambda$:\n$$ \\lambda_n = \\frac{n \\pi}{\\omega} $$\nSince $\\lambda$ was defined as positive, and negative values of $n$ only flip the sign of the eigenfunction $\\sin(\\lambda_n \\theta)$ which can be absorbed into the constant $A$, we can restrict $n$ to be a positive integer, $n \\in \\mathbb{N} = \\{1, 2, 3, \\ldots\\}$.\nThe imposition of two boundary conditions on the second-order ordinary differential equation for $G(\\theta)$ constitutes a Sturm-Liouville eigenvalue problem. Such problems are known to possess a discrete spectrum of eigenvalues, in this case the values of $k = \\lambda_n^2$. This is precisely why the boundary conditions lead to a discrete family of admissible exponents.\n\nNow, we solve the radial equation with $k = \\lambda_n^2$:\n$$ r^2 F_n''(r) + r F_n'(r) - \\lambda_n^2 F_n(r) = 0 $$\nThis is a Cauchy-Euler equation. We seek solutions of the form $F_n(r) = r^p$. Substituting this form into the equation gives the indicial equation:\n$$ p(p-1) + p - \\lambda_n^2 = 0 \\implies p^2 - \\lambda_n^2 = 0 \\implies p = \\pm \\lambda_n $$\nThe general solution for the radial part is thus:\n$$ F_n(r) = C_1 r^{\\lambda_n} + C_2 r^{-\\lambda_n} $$\nThe problem requires the displacement field $u(r, \\theta)$ to be bounded as $r \\to 0^+$. Since $\\lambda_n = \\frac{n \\pi}{\\omega} > 0$ for $n \\in \\mathbb{N}$ and $\\omega \\in (0, 2\\pi]$, the term $r^{-\\lambda_n}$ diverges as $r \\to 0^+$. To ensure boundedness of the solution, its coefficient must be zero, so we set $C_2 = 0$.\nThe physically acceptable radial solution is therefore $F_n(r) = C_1 r^{\\lambda_n}$.\n\nCombining the radial and angular parts, the separable eigenfunctions bounded at the origin are of the form:\n$$ u_n(r, \\theta) = A_n r^{\\lambda_n} \\sin(\\lambda_n \\theta) $$\nwhere $A_n$ are constants and the admissible exponents $\\lambda_n$ are given by the derived expression. The general solution is a superposition of these eigenfunctions:\n$$ u(r, \\theta) = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} A_n r^{\\frac{n \\pi}{\\omega}} \\sin\\left(\\frac{n \\pi}{\\omega} \\theta\\right) $$\nThe problem asks for the closed-form analytic expression for the admissible exponents $\\lambda$ as a function of the integer mode index $n$ and the wedge angle $\\omega$. Based on our derivation, this expression is:\n$$ \\lambda = \\frac{n \\pi}{\\omega} $$\nThe exponent $\\lambda$ is dimensionless, as $n$ and $\\pi$ are dimensionless numbers and $\\omega$ is an angle in radians, which is also a dimensionless quantity.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{n \\pi}{\\omega}}$$", "id": "2602453"}, {"introduction": "Building on the fundamental derivation, this practice explores a more common engineering scenario involving traction-free surfaces, such as those at the corner of an unloaded structural component [@problem_id:2602467].

The estimation is to be performed using a sequence of measured energy norm errors, $e_k$, corresponding to a sequence of characteristic mesh sizes, $h_k$, on geometrically graded meshes.

It is scientifically grounded in the well-established theory of finite element analysis for singular problems. The premises are factually sound, the objective is clearly defined, and the provided test cases are numerically plausible scenarios. We shall proceed with the derivation and implementation of the required procedure.\n\nThe theoretical foundation is the a priori error estimate for the energy norm of the error, which, for linear finite elements ($p=1$) on a geometrically graded mesh with grading exponent $\\beta$, is given by:\n$$\ne_h \\equiv \\| \\nabla(u - u_h) \\|_{L^2(\\Omega)} \\approx C h^{\\alpha}\n$$\nHere, $u$ is the exact solution, $u_h$ is the FE approximation, $h$ is the characteristic mesh size near the singularity, and $C$ is a constant independent of $h$.

The convergence rate $\\alpha$ is the slope of the line in the log-log plot of error versus mesh size.\n\nDirectly applying linear regression to all data points $(x_k, y_k)$ is naive, as numerical data is often contaminated. Coarser meshes (larger $h_k$) may not be in the asymptotic regime where the theory holds, and all measurements can be subject to small perturbations. The problem mandates a robust procedure to mitigate these issues.\n\nThe prescribed robust strategy involves analyzing suffixes of the data sequence. The rationale is that the asymptotic error estimate is more accurate for smaller $h_k$, which correspond to the final entries in a sequence of progressively refined meshes. We consider all suffixes of length $m \\geq 3$, where a minimum of 3 points is required for a minimally robust statistical analysis (e.g., to compute a standard deviation of pairwise slopes).\n\nFor each candidate suffix, consisting of the last $m$ data points, we evaluate its quality using two metrics:\n1.  **Goodness of Fit**: This measures how well the points in the suffix adhere to a linear model. We perform a linear least-squares regression on the $(\\ln h, \\ln e)$ data for the suffix to find an estimated slope $\\widehat{\\alpha}_m$ and intercept $\\widehat{c}_m$. The quality of this fit is quantified by the Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE):\n    $$\n    R_m = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{m} \\sum_{i=N-m+1}^{N} \\left( \\ln(e_i) - (\\widehat{\\alpha}_m \\ln(h_i) + \\widehat{c}_m) \\right)^2}\n    $$\n2.  **Stability of Convergence Rate**: This measures the consistency of the convergence rate within the suffix. We compute the local, pairwise slopes between consecutive points:\n    $$\n    s_i = \\frac{\\ln(e_{i+1}) - \\ln(e_i)}{\\ln(h_{i+1}) - \\ln(h_i)}\n    $$\n    for points $i$ and $i+1$ within the suffix. The stability is then measured by the standard deviation, $V_m$, of these pairwise slopes. A small $V_m$ indicates that the convergence rate is stable across the refinement levels included in the suffix.\n\nTo select the \"best\" suffix, we must balance these two criteria. A smaller RMSE and a smaller standard deviation of slopes are both desirable. We define a simple, unweighted cost function, $J_m$, for each suffix of length $m$:\n$$\nJ_m = R_m + V_m\n$$\nThe suffix that minimizes this cost function is deemed the most reliable representation of the asymptotic behavior. The slope $\\widehat{\\alpha}$ from the linear fit on this optimal suffix is selected as our best estimate of the convergence rate.\n\nOnce the optimal rate $\\widehat{\\alpha}$ is determined, we must account for the saturation effect imposed by the polynomial degree of the basis functions. The true rate $\\alpha$ cannot exceed $p=1$. Therefore, we clip our estimated rate:\n$$\n\\widehat{\\alpha}_{\\text{clip}} = \\min(\\widehat{\\alpha}, 1.0)\n$$\nFinally, we invert the relation $\\widehat{\\alpha}_{\\text{clip}} = \\beta \\widehat{\\lambda}$ to find the estimate for the singularity exponent:\n$$\n\\widehat{\\lambda} = \\frac{\\widehat{\\alpha}_{\\text{clip}}}{\\beta}\n$$\nThis completes the design of the robust estimation procedure.
