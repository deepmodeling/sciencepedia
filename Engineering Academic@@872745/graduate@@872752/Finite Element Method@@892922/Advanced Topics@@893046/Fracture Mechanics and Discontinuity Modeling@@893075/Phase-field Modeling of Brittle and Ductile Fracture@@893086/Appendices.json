A valid model must be constructed within an energy-minimization framework for a quasi-static, small-strain process. The phase-field variable $d$ ranges from $d=0$ (intact) to $d=1$ (fully broken).\n\nThe general form of the potential energy is $\\Pi[\\mathbf{u}, d] = \\Psi_e[\\mathbf{u}, d] + \\Psi_f[d]$, where $\\Psi_e$ is the elastic energy and $\\Psi_f$ is the fracture energy. The elastic energy density $\\psi_e$ is a function of the strain tensor $\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}$ and the damage field $d$. The stress tensor is derived as $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma} = \\partial_{\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}} \\psi_e$. The evolution of damage is governed by the principle of minimum potential energy, subject to the irreversibility constraint $\\dot{d} \\ge 0$. The four requirements are: (i) degradation of tensile energy only, (ii) thermodynamic consistency (irreversibility and non-negative dissipation), (iii) no damage under homogeneous compression, and (iv) numerical well-posedness for the finite element method (FEM) implementation.\n\nLet us analyze each option against these requirements.\n\n**Option A)**\nThis option proposes a degradation function $g(d)=(1-d)^2+\\kappa$ with a small residual stiffness parameter $0  \\kappa \\ll 1$. It employs a spectral decomposition of the elastic energy density into tensile $\\psi^{+}(\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon})$ and compressive $\\psi^{-}(\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon})$ parts. The degraded energy density is implicitly $\\psi_e(\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}, d) = g(d)\\psi^{+}(\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon})+\\psi^{-}(\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon})$. The stress is consistently defined as $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}=\\partial_{\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}}\\psi_e$. Irreversibility is enforced via a history field $H(\\mathbf{x},t)=\\max_{\\tau\\le t}\\psi^{+}(\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}(\\mathbf{x},\\tau))$, which acts as the damage driver.\n\n- **(i) Tensile degradation only:** This is satisfied. The spectral split isolates the energy contribution from tensile principal strains into $\\psi^{+}(\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon})$, and only this part is degraded by the function $g(d)$.\n- **(ii) Thermodynamic consistency:** The use of a history field $H(t)$, which is non-decreasing by definition, ensures that damage evolution is irreversible, satisfying $\\dot{d} \\ge 0$. The dissipation rate is proportional to $-g'(d)\\psi^{+}\\dot{d}$. Since $\\psi^{+} \\ge 0$ and $\\dot{d} \\ge 0$, non-negative dissipation requires $g'(d) \\le 0$. For $g(d)=(1-d)^2+\\kappa$, the derivative is $g'(d) = -2(1-d)$, which is non-positive for $d \\in [0,1]$. Both conditions are met.\n- **(iii) No damage under compression:** In a state of homogeneous compression, all principal strains are non-positive. Consequently, the tensile energy part is zero: $\\psi^{+}(\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon})=0$. This means the history field $H$ does not increase, and thus no damage evolution occurs. The stress reduces to $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}=\\partial_{\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}}\\psi^{-}(\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon})$, representing the undamaged elastic response. This requirement is met.\n- **(iv) Numerical well-posedness:** As damage approaches its maximum value, $d \\to 1$, the degradation function approaches a small positive value, $g(1) = \\kappa  0$. This residual stiffness ensures that the acoustic tensor and the corresponding tangent stiffness matrix in the FEM model remain positive definite (coercive), preventing numerical singularity and ill-conditioning. This requirement is met.\n\nAll four requirements are satisfied.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**Option B)**\nThis option proposes a degradation function $g(d)=1-d$ applied to the total elastic energy $\\psi(\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon})$ without a tension-compression split. The model is explicitly stated to be reversible, meaning the condition $\\dot{d} \\ge 0$ is not enforced.\n\n- **(i) Tensile degradation only:** This is violated. The model degrades the entire elastic energy, including the response to compression, which is physically incorrect for fracture.\n- **(ii) Thermodynamic consistency:** This is violated. The problem explicitly states that $d$ may decrease, which violates the irreversibility constraint $\\dot{d} \\ge 0$. This would imply crack 'healing' upon unloading, which is unphysical for brittle/ductile fracture and violates the second law of thermodynamics in this context as it would allow for negative dissipation.\n- **(iii) No damage under compression:** This is violated. Since the total elastic energy is used as the driver, compressive states ($\\psi  0$) would cause stiffness degradation and damage growth.\n- **(iv) Numerical well-posedness:** As $d \\to 1$, $g(d) \\to 0$. There is no residual stiffness, which leads to singular tangent matrices in fully cracked regions, causing severe numerical convergence issues. This requirement is violated.\n\nThis model fails on all criteria.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**Option C)**\nThis option uses a degradation function $g(d)=(1-d)^2$ and a spectral split for the stress, implying an energy of the form $\\psi_e = g(d)\\psi^{+} + \\psi^{-}$. However, it crucially uses the *total* elastic energy $\\psi(\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon})=\\psi^{+}+\\psi^{-}$ for the history field, $H(\\mathbf{x},t)=\\max_{\\tau\\le t}\\psi(\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}(\\mathbf{x},\\tau))$.\n\n- **(i) Tensile degradation only:** The structure of the stored energy $\\psi_e$ correctly degrades only the tensile part.\n- **(ii) Thermodynamic consistency:** The use of a history field ensures $\\dot{d} \\ge 0$. The derivative $g'(d)=-2(1-d) \\le 0$ ensures non-negative dissipation. This requirement is met.\n- **(iii) No damage under compression:** This is violated. Under pure compression, $\\psi^{+} = 0$ but $\\psi^{-}  0$. The history field is based on the total energy $\\psi = \\psi^{-}$, so it would increase under sufficient compression, leading to damage growth. This is a critical physical inconsistency.\n- **(iv) Numerical well-posedness:** The degradation function is $g(d)=(1-d)^2$, so $g(1)=0$. The lack of a residual stiffness parameter $\\kappa$ leads to singular tangent matrices, violating this requirement.\n\nThis model fails on requirements (iii) and (iv).\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**Option D)**\nThis option proposes a volumetric-deviatoric split, degrading only the positive part of the volumetric energy, $\\psi_{\\mathrm{vol}}^{+}$. The form of the energy is $\\psi(\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon},d)=g(d)\\,\\psi_{\\mathrm{vol}}^{+}(\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon})+\\psi_{\\mathrm{vol}}^{-}(\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon})+\\psi_{\\mathrm{dev}}(\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon})$.\n\n- **(i) Tensile degradation only:** This is not fully satisfied. While this model correctly avoids damage under pure compression, it fails to initiate damage under loading states that are tensile but volume-preserving, such as pure shear. In pure shear, $\\mathrm{tr}(\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon})=0$, so $\\psi_{\\mathrm{vol}}^{+}=0$, and the model predicts no damage. However, pure shear induces principal tensile stresses and should cause fracture in many materials. Therefore, this model does not correctly \"degrade stiffness only under tensile loading\" in the general sense. The spectral split is superior in this regard.\n- **(ii) Thermodynamic consistency:** This is satisfied, assuming a standard monotone decreasing $g(d)$. The history is taken on $\\psi_{\\mathrm{vol}}^{+}$, correctly enforcing irreversibility for the chosen driver.\n- **(iii) No damage under compression:** This is satisfied. Under homogeneous compression, $\\mathrm{tr}(\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon})0$, so $\\psi_{\\mathrm{vol}}^{+}=0$, and no damage evolution occurs.\n- **(iv) Numerical well-posedness:** The problem does not specify the function $g(d)$. If it lacks a residual stiffness term (i.e., $g(1)=0$), this requirement would be violated. However, the failure on physical grounds in point (i) is sufficient to disqualify this option as a general-purpose fracture model.\n\nThis model has a fundamental physical shortcoming compared to spectral models.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**Option E)**\nThis option describes a model with a spectral split and defines the degradation function $g(d)$ by its properties: monotone decreasing, $g(0)=1$, $g(1)=\\kappa$ for $0\\kappa\\ll 1$, and additionally $g'(0)=0$. Irreversibility is enforced via a more formal Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) complementarity formulation.\n\n- **(i) Tensile degradation only:** This is satisfied due to the use of the spectral split $\\psi^{\\pm}$, identical to option A.\n- **(ii) Thermodynamic consistency:** This is satisfied. A KKT formulation is the rigorous mathematical framework for enforcing the inequality constraint $\\dot{d} \\ge 0$. The condition that $g(d)$ is monotone decreasing ensures non-negative dissipation.\n- **(iii) No damage under compression:** This is satisfied. The spectral split ensures the damage driver is zero under compression.\n- **(iv) Numerical well-posedness:** This is satisfied. The property $g(1)=\\kappa  0$ provides the residual stiffness necessary to keep the tangent operator coercive. The additional property $g'(0)=0$ is a refinement that improves numerical performance by ensuring a truly elastic response at the onset of loading, but is not strictly necessary to meet the problem's stated requirements.\n\nThis option describes a set of properties that constitute a state-of-the-art, robust, and well-posed phase-field fracture model. All four requirements are met.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\nIn summary, both options A and E describe modeling choices that satisfy all specified requirements. They represent two widely accepted and robust formulations for phase-field fracture, with minor differences in the choice of $g(d)$ and the method of enforcing irreversibility (history field vs. abstract KKT conditions, which are conceptually linked).", "answer": "$$\\boxed{AE}$$", "id": "2587041"}, {"introduction": "With the conceptual framework in place, we can now focus on the core mechanics of the model: the constitutive relationship between stress and strain.

This condition is found by setting the partial derivative of $\\Psi$ with respect to $d$ to zero:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial \\Psi}{\\partial d} = 2(1-d)(-1) \\frac{1}{2}E\\varepsilon^2 + \\frac{G_c}{\\ell}d = 0\n$$\n$$\n-(1-d)E\\varepsilon^2 + \\frac{G_c}{\\ell}d = 0\n$$\nSolving for the equilibrium phase-field value $d$ as a function of strain $\\varepsilon$:\n$$\nd\\left(E\\varepsilon^2 + \\frac{G_c}{\\ell}\\right) = E\\varepsilon^2 \\quad \\implies \\quad d(\\varepsilon) = \\frac{E\\varepsilon^2}{E\\varepsilon^2 + G_c/\\ell}\n$$\nThe nominal stress $\\sigma$ in the degraded material is given by the derivative of the elastic energy density with respect to strain, scaled by the degradation function:\n$$\n\\sigma = \\frac{\\partial (g(d)\\psi_e)}{\\partial \\varepsilon} = g(d) \\frac{\\partial \\psi_e}{\\partial \\varepsilon} = (1-d)^2 E \\varepsilon\n$$\nSubstituting the equilibrium expression for $d(\\varepsilon)$ into the stress relation requires first evaluating $(1-d)$:\n$$\n1 - d(\\varepsilon) = 1 - \\frac{E\\varepsilon^2}{E\\varepsilon^2 + G_c/\\ell} = \\frac{E\\varepsilon^2 + G_c/\\ell - E\\varepsilon^2}{E\\varepsilon^2 + G_c/\\ell} = \\frac{G_c/\\ell}{E\\varepsilon^2 + G_c/\\ell}\n$$\nNow, we obtain the stress as an explicit function of strain:\n$$\n\\sigma(\\varepsilon) = \\left(\\frac{G_c/\\ell}{E\\varepsilon^2 + G_c/\\ell}\\right)^2 E\\varepsilon = \\frac{(G_c/\\ell)^2 E \\varepsilon}{(E\\varepsilon^2 + G_c/\\ell)^2}\n$$\nThe critical stress $\\sigma_c$ is the maximum value of $\\sigma(\\varepsilon)$, which corresponds to the onset of material softening. We find this peak by setting the derivative of $\\sigma(\\varepsilon)$ with respect to $\\varepsilon$ to zero:\n$$\n\\frac{\\mathrm{d}\\sigma}{\\mathrm{d}\\varepsilon} = (G_c/\\ell)^2 E \\frac{\\mathrm{d}}{\\mathrm{d}\\varepsilon} \\left[ \\frac{\\varepsilon}{(E\\varepsilon^2 + G_c/\\ell)^2} \\right] = 0\n$$\nApplying the quotient rule for differentiation:\n$$\n1 \\cdot (E\\varepsilon^2 + G_c/\\ell)^2 - \\varepsilon \\cdot 2(E\\varepsilon^2 + G_c/\\ell)(2E\\varepsilon) = 0\n$$\nAssuming $\\varepsilon \\neq 0$, we can divide by $(E\\varepsilon^2 + G_c/\\ell)$:\n$$\n(E\\varepsilon^2 + G_c/\\ell) - 4E\\varepsilon^2 = 0\n$$\n$$\nG_c/\\ell - 3E\\varepsilon^2 = 0\n$$\nThis gives the critical strain $\\varepsilon_c$ at which the stress is maximum:\n$$\n\\varepsilon_c^2 = \\frac{G_c}{3E\\ell} \\quad \\implies \\quad \\varepsilon_c = \\sqrt{\\frac{G_c}{3E\\ell}}\n$$\nSubstituting $\\varepsilon_c$ back into the expression for $\\sigma(\\varepsilon)$ yields the critical stress $\\sigma_c$:\n$$\n\\sigma_c = \\sigma(\\varepsilon_c) = \\frac{(G_c/\\ell)^2 E \\varepsilon_c}{(E\\varepsilon_c^2 + G_c/\\ell)^2} = \\frac{(G_c/\\ell)^2 E \\sqrt{G_c/(3E\\ell)}}{(E(G_c/(3E\\ell)) + G_c/\\ell)^2}\n$$\nThe denominator simplifies to:\n$$\n\\left(\\frac{G_c}{3\\ell} + \\frac{G_c}{\\ell}\\right)^2 = \\left(\\frac{4G_c}{3\\ell}\\right)^2 = \\frac{16}{9}\\left(\\frac{G_c}{\\ell}\\right)^2\n$$\nTherefore, the critical stress is:\n$$\n\\sigma_c = \\frac{(G_c/\\ell)^2 E \\sqrt{G_c/(3E\\ell)}}{\\frac{16}{9}(G_c/\\ell)^2} = \\frac{9}{16} E \\sqrt{\\frac{G_c}{3E\\ell}} = \\frac{9}{16} \\sqrt{E^2 \\frac{G_c}{3E\\ell}} = \\frac{9}{16} \\sqrt{\\frac{EG_c}{3\\ell}}\n$$\nThis can be written as:\n$$\n\\sigma_c = \\frac{3\\sqrt{3}}{16}\\sqrt{\\frac{EG_c}{\\ell}}\n$$\nThis result shows the scaling of $\\sigma_c$ with $E$, $G_c$, and $\\ell$, as requested.\n\n**Part 2: Isolated Crack Profile and Width**\n\nFor an isolated crack in an infinite domain under zero load, the elastic energy term is zero ($\\psi_e=0$). The total energy is purely due to the fracture regularization term. We must minimize:\n$$\n\\mathcal{E}[d] = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} G_c \\gamma_\\ell(d,d') \\mathrm{d}x = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} G_c \\left( \\frac{d^2}{2\\ell} + \\frac{\\ell (d')^2}{2} \\right) \\mathrm{d}x\n$$\nThe corresponding Euler-Lagrange equation for the minimizer $d(x)$ is:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial \\mathcal{L}}{\\partial d} - \\frac{\\mathrm{d}}{\\mathrm{d}x}\\left(\\frac{\\partial \\mathcal{L}}{\\partial d'}\\right) = 0 \\quad \\text{where } \\mathcal{L} = G_c \\left( \\frac{d^2}{2\\ell} + \\frac{\\ell (d')^2}{2} \\right)\n$$\n$$\nG_c\\frac{d}{\\ell} - \\frac{\\mathrm{d}}{\\mathrm{d}x}(G_c\\ell d') = 0 \\quad \\implies \\quad \\frac{d}{\\ell} - \\ell d'' = 0\n$$\n$$\nd''(x) - \\frac{1}{\\ell^2}d(x) = 0\n$$\nThis is a standard homogeneous second-order linear ordinary differential equation. Its general solution is $d(x) = C_1 e^{x/\\ell} + C_2 e^{-x/\\ell}$. We apply the boundary conditions: $d(0)=1$ and $\\lim_{|x|\\to\\infty}d(x)=0$.\n- For the solution to decay as $x \\to \\infty$, we must have $C_1=0$. Thus, for $x \\ge 0$, $d(x) = C_2 e^{-x/\\ell}$.\n- For the solution to decay as $x \\to -\\infty$, we must have $C_2=0$. Thus, for $x \\le 0$, $d(x) = C_1 e^{x/\\ell}$.\nCombining these and enforcing continuity and symmetry ($d(x)=d(-x)$), the solution takes the form $d(x) = C e^{-|x|/\\ell}$. Applying the condition at the center, $d(0)=1$:\n$$\nC e^{-|0|/\\ell} = C = 1 \\implies d(x) = e^{-|x|/\\ell}\n$$\nThe full width at half maximum, $w$, is the distance between the two points where $d(x) = \\frac{1}{2}$. Let $x_h  0$ be the point where this condition is met:\n$$\nd(x_h) = e^{-x_h/\\ell} = \\frac{1}{2}\n$$\nTaking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n$$\n-\\frac{x_h}{\\ell} = \\ln\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) = -\\ln(2) \\quad \\implies \\quad x_h = \\ell\\ln(2)\n$$\nBy symmetry, the other point is at $-x_h$. The full width $w$ is the distance between these points:\n$$\nw = x_h - (-x_h) = 2x_h = 2\\ell\\ln(2)\n$$\n\n**Part 3: Calibration Formulas for $G_c$ and $\\ell$**\n\nWe have derived two key relationships connecting the model parameters ($\\ell, G_c$) to measurable quantities ($w, \\sigma_c, E$):\n1.  $\\sigma_c = \\frac{3\\sqrt{3}}{16}\\sqrt{\\frac{EG_c}{\\ell}}$\n2.  $w = 2\\ell\\ln(2)$\n\nWe now algebraically manipulate these equations to express $\\ell$ and $G_c$ in terms of $E$, $\\sigma_c$, and $w$.\nFrom equation (2), we can directly solve for the length scale $\\ell$:\n$$\n\\ell = \\frac{w}{2\\ln(2)}\n$$\nNext, we rearrange equation (1) to solve for $G_c$:\n$$\n\\sqrt{\\frac{EG_c}{\\ell}} = \\frac{16\\sigma_c}{3\\sqrt{3}}\n$$\nSquaring both sides gives:\n$$\n\\frac{EG_c}{\\ell} = \\left(\\frac{16\\sigma_c}{3\\sqrt{3}}\\right)^2 = \\frac{256\\sigma_c^2}{27}\n$$\n$$\nG_c = \\frac{256\\sigma_c^2 \\ell}{27E}\n$$\nFinally, we substitute the expression for $\\ell$ from our first calibration formula into this equation for $G_c$ to eliminate $\\ell$:\n$$\nG_c = \\frac{256\\sigma_c^2}{27E} \\left(\\frac{w}{2\\ln(2)}\\right) = \\frac{128\\sigma_c^2 w}{27E\\ln(2)}\n$$\nThe final calibration formulas are:\n$$\n\\ell = \\frac{w}{2\\ln(2)} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad G_c = \\frac{128\\sigma_c^2 w}{27E\\ln(2)}\n$$\nThese formulas allow for the direct computation of the phase-field model parameters from experimental measurements.\n\n**Part 4: Implementation**\nThe program requires implementing the derived calibration formulas for the provided test cases.
