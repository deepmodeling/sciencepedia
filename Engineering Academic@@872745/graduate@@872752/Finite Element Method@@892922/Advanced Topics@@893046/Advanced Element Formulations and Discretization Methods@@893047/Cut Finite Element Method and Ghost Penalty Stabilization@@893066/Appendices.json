The problem is well-posed and contains all necessary information for a unique solution. We will proceed by determining the dimension of each space, $V_{h}^{\\mathrm{fit}}$ and $V_{h}^{\\mathrm{cut}}$, according to their definitions. The dimension of a finite element space is equal to the number of its basis functions, which, in the context of Lagrange elements, is the number of degrees of freedom (nodes) before the application of any essential boundary conditions.\n\nFirst, we determine the dimension of the fitted space, $\\dim V_{h}^{\\mathrm{fit}}$.\nThe physical domain is given as $\\Omega=(0.48, 0.52)$. The length of this domain is $L = 0.52 - 0.48 = 0.04$. The target element size for the fitted mesh is specified as $h = \\frac{1}{4} = 0.25$.\nThe definition of the fitted mesh states that it is constructed by partitioning $\\Omega$ into subintervals of length at most $h$. Since the total length of the domain $L=0.04$ is less than the maximum allowed element size $h=0.25$, the entire domain $\\Omega$ is treated as a single finite element. This element is the interval $[0.48, 0.52]$.\nThe finite element space is composed of continuous, piecewise-linear functions. For a single linear element, the basis functions are uniquely determined by the nodal values at its vertices. The vertices of the element $[0.48, 0.52]$ are the points $0.48$ and $0.52$.\nThese two points are the nodes of the fitted mesh. The number of degrees of freedom is therefore $2$.\nThus, the dimension of the fitted space is:\n$$\n\\dim V_{h}^{\\mathrm{fit}} = 2\n$$\n\nNext, we determine the dimension of the unfitted (cut) space, $\\dim V_{h}^{\\mathrm{cut}}$.\nThis space is built upon a background mesh covering the computational domain $\\widetilde{\\Omega}=(0,1)$. This background mesh is a uniform partition with mesh size $h=\\frac{1}{4}$. The nodes of the background mesh are located at $\\{0, \\frac{1}{4}, \\frac{1}{2}, \\frac{3}{4}, 1\\}$, which correspond to the numerical values $\\{0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1\\}$.\nThe background elements are the intervals between these nodes: $I_1 = (0, 0.25)$, $I_2 = (0.25, 0.5)$, $I_3 = (0.5, 0.75)$, and $I_4 = (0.75, 1)$.\n\nAccording to the definition of $V_{h}^{\\mathrm{cut}}$, we must first identify the \"active elements\", which are the background elements whose intersection with the physical domain $\\Omega=(0.48, 0.52)$ is non-empty. We check each background element:\n- Intersection with $I_1$: $(0, 0.25) \\cap (0.48, 0.52) = \\emptyset$.\n- Intersection with $I_2$: $(0.25, 0.5) \\cap (0.48, 0.52) = (0.48, 0.5)$. This intersection is non-empty, so $I_2$ is an active element.\n- Intersection with $I_3$: $(0.5, 0.75) \\cap (0.48, 0.52) = (0.5, 0.52)$. This intersection is non-empty, so $I_3$ is an active element.\n- Intersection with $I_4$: $(0.75, 1) \\cap (0.48, 0.52) = \\emptyset$.\n\nThe set of active elements is $\\{I_2, I_3\\}$. The \"active degrees of freedom\" are defined as those associated with *all* vertices of the active elements.\n- The vertices of active element $I_2 = (0.25, 0.5)$ are the nodes at $0.25$ and $0.5$.\n- The vertices of active element $I_3 = (0.5, 0.75)$ are the nodes at $0.5$ and $0.75$.\n\nThe set of all active nodes is the union of the sets of vertices from all active elements: $\\{0.25, 0.5\\} \\cup \\{0.5, 0.75\\} = \\{0.25, 0.5, 0.75\\}$.\nThe number of distinct active nodes is $3$. The dimension of the unfitted space is the number of these active degrees of freedom. The mention of ghost penalty stabilization is a distraction, as the problem correctly states it does not add degrees of freedom.\nThus, the dimension of the unfitted space is:\n$$\n\\dim V_{h}^{\\mathrm{cut}} = 3\n$$\n\nFinally, we compute the required difference, $D$:\n$$\nD = \\dim V_{h}^{\\mathrm{cut}} - \\dim V_{h}^{\\mathrm{fit}} = 3 - 2 = 1\n$$\nThe difference is an integer, and no rounding is necessary.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{1}\n$$", "id": "2551896"}, {"introduction": "The power of CutFEM to handle complex geometries on simple meshes comes with a significant challenge: numerical instability arising from arbitrarily small intersections between the mesh and the domain.
