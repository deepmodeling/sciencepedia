The sampling period is $T$, and the sampling frequency is $\\Omega_s = 2\\pi/T$.\n3.  A strict non-aliasing condition holds: $\\Omega_b  \\pi/T$, which is equivalent to $\\Omega_b  \\Omega_s/2$.\n4.  The signal is sampled using an impulse train, resulting in a sampled signal whose continuous-time Fourier transform, $X_s(j\\Omega)$, is a periodic repetition of $X_c(j\\Omega)$. Specifically, $X_s(j\\Omega) = \\frac{1}{T} \\sum_{k=-\\infty}^{\\infty} X_c(j(\\Omega - k\\Omega_s))$.\n5.  Reconstruction is achieved with a lowpass filter with passband edge $\\Omega_p$ and stopband edge $\\Omega_{s1}$.\n6.

It is well-posed, as the constraints are sufficient to determine a unique maximum for the quantity of interest. The language is objective and precise. Therefore, the problem is deemed valid and a solution can be constructed.\n\nThe spectrum of the sampled signal, $X_s(j\\Omega)$, consists of scaled copies of the original spectrum, $X_c(j\\Omega)$, centered at integer multiples of the sampling frequency $\\Omega_s$. The baseband component (for $k=0$) occupies the frequency interval $[-\\Omega_b, \\Omega_b]$. The first spectral images (for $k=\\pm 1$) are centered at $\\Omega = \\pm \\Omega_s$.

The frequency range between the end of the baseband spectrum and the beginning of the first positive-frequency image is called the guard band. The baseband spectrum ends at $\\Omega = \\Omega_b$. The first image begins at $\\Omega = \\Omega_s - \\Omega_b$. The guard band is the interval $(\\Omega_b, \\Omega_s - \\Omega_b)$.\n\nA lowpass filter used for perfect reconstruction must satisfy two conditions:\n1.  It must pass the entire baseband spectrum without distortion. For an ideal lowpass filter, this implies its passband must cover the interval $[-\\Omega_b, \\Omega_b]$. Considering only positive frequencies, the passband edge $\\Omega_p$ must satisfy the condition $\\Omega_p \\geq \\Omega_b$.\n2.  It must completely eliminate all spectral images. This means its stopband must begin at or before the start of the first image. Considering the first positive-frequency image, the stopband edge $\\Omega_{s1}$ must satisfy the condition $\\Omega_{s1} \\leq \\Omega_s - \\Omega_b$. This is consistent with the constraint provided in the problem statement.\n\nThe transition band of the filter is the frequency range $[\\Omega_p, \\Omega_{s1}]$, and its width is defined as $\\Delta \\Omega = \\Omega_{s1} - \\Omega_p$.

The minimum value of $\\Omega_p$ is $\\Omega_b$. Substituting these extremal values into the expression for $\\Delta \\Omega$ gives the maximal possible transition band width, which we denote as $\\Delta \\Omega_{\\text{max}}$.\nSetting $(\\Omega_{s1})_{\\text{max}} = \\Omega_s - \\Omega_b$ and $(\\Omega_p)_{\\text{min}} = \\Omega_b$, we obtain:\n$$\n\\Delta \\Omega_{\\text{max}} = (\\Omega_s - \\Omega_b) - \\Omega_b = \\Omega_s - 2\\Omega_b\n$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be expressed as a function of $T$ and $\\Omega_b$.

It is the maximal frequency range that the transition band of the reconstruction filter can occupy while still ensuring perfect recovery of the original signal. This width is non-zero only because of the oversampling condition $\\Omega_b  \\pi/T$. If sampling occurs at the Nyquist rate, $\\Omega_b = \\pi/T$, then $\\Delta \\Omega_{\\text{max}} = 2\\pi/T - 2(\\pi/T) = 0$, which corresponds to the requirement of an ideal brick-wall filter.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\frac{2\\pi}{T} - 2\\Omega_b}\n$$", "id": "2878695"}, {"introduction": "While filter design often focuses on passband and stopband specifications, a more holistic view quantifies the total error introduced by a non-ideal interpolator.

A rigorous solution can be derived. We proceed.\n\nThe solution requires analyzing the signal in the frequency domain at each stage of the conversion process. Let $\\omega$ denote the frequency variable in radians per sample for the signal at the intermediate stage (after upsampling and before downsampling).\n\n1.  **Upsampling by $L$**: The input signal $x[n]$ with spectrum $X(\\exp(j\\omega_x))$ is upsampled to produce $v[n]$. The spectrum of $v[n]$ is given by $V(\\exp(j\\omega)) = X(\\exp(j\\omega L))$. The original spectrum of $x[n]$, which was bandlimited to $[-\\omega_b, \\omega_b]$, is compressed by a factor of $L$ to occupy the band $[-\\omega_b/L, \\omega_b/L]$. Additionally, $L-1$ spectral images (replicas) are created, centered at frequencies $2\\pi k/L$ for $k=1, 2, ..., L-1$. The magnitude of these images is also bounded by $1$.\n\n2.  **Filtering**: The signal $v[n]$ is passed through the lowpass filter $H(\\exp(j\\omega))$ to produce $w[n]$. The spectrum is $W(\\exp(j\\omega)) = H(\\exp(j\\omega))V(\\exp(j\\omega))$. The purpose of this filter is twofold:\n    - It must pass the desired baseband component, which is the compressed version of the original signal's spectrum residing in $[-\\omega_b/L, \\omega_b/L]$.\n    - It must attenuate all spurious content, which includes the spectral images created by upsampling and any components that would cause aliasing upon downsampling.\n\n3.  **Downsampling by $M$**: The filtered signal $w[n]$ is downsampled to produce the output $y[n]$. The spectrum $Y(\\exp(j\\omega_y))$ is given by the aliasing formula:\n    $$Y(\\exp(j\\omega_y)) = \\frac{1}{M} \\sum_{k=0}^{M-1} W(\\exp(j\\frac{\\omega_y - 2\\pi k}{M}))$$\n    The term for $k=0$ represents the desired output spectrum, while the terms for $k=1, \\dots, M-1$ represent aliased components.\n\nTo satisfy the problem's requirements, the filter $H(\\exp(j\\omega))$ must be specified such that all spurious content is attenuated to a level of $\\delta$. This requires defining the passband and stopband edges, $\\Omega_p$ and $\\Omega_s$, as stringently as possible, which in turn defines the transition width $\\Delta\\omega$.\n\n**Passband Requirement**: The filter must preserve the baseband component of $V(\\exp(j\\omega))$, which is non-zero in the interval $[-\\omega_b/L, \\omega_b/L]$. Therefore, this entire interval must lie within the filter's passband. The tightest specification that satisfies this is to set the passband edge precisely at the edge of the signal's bandwidth:\n$$\\Omega_p = \\frac{\\omega_b}{L}$$\n\n**Stopband Requirement**: The filter's stopband must attenuate all unwanted frequency components to prevent them from appearing as spurious content in the output. There are two sources of such components at the filter's input $V(\\exp(j\\omega))$:\n1.  **Imaging from Upsampling**: The first spectral image lies in the frequency band $[2\\pi/L - \\omega_b/L, 2\\pi/L + \\omega_b/L]$. To attenuate this image, the filter's stopband must begin at or before the lower edge of this band. This imposes the constraint:\n    $$\\Omega_s \\leq \\frac{2\\pi}{L} - \\frac{\\omega_b}{L}$$\n2.  **Aliasing from Downsampling**: To prevent any aliasing in the output signal $y[n]$, the signal $w[n]$ entering the downsampler must be bandlimited to the Nyquist frequency of the output sample rate, which is $\\pi/M$. Any energy in $W(\\exp(j\\omega))$ at frequencies $|\\omega| \\geq \\pi/M$ will fold into the baseband $[-\\pi, \\pi]$ of the output signal spectrum $Y(\\exp(j\\omega_y))$. To bound all such spurious content, the filter's stopband must begin at or before $\\pi/M$. This imposes the constraint:\n    $$\\Omega_s \\leq \\frac{\\pi}{M}$$\n\nTo guarantee that both imaging and aliasing artifacts are suppressed, the filter's stopband must satisfy both constraints simultaneously. Thus, the stopband edge must be chosen to satisfy:\n$$\\Omega_s \\leq \\min\\left(\\frac{2\\pi}{L} - \\frac{\\omega_b}{L}, \\frac{\\pi}{M}\\right)$$\nTo allow for the widest possible transition band for a given passband requirement (which makes the filter easier to implement), one would choose the largest possible value for $\\Omega_s$. The tightest specification for the stopband, which defines the region that must be attenuated, is therefore:\n$$\\Omega_s = \\min\\left(\\frac{2\\pi}{L} - \\frac{\\omega_b}{L}, \\frac{\\pi}{M}\\right)$$\n\nThe problem asks for the smallest admissible transition width, $\\Delta\\omega = \\Omega_s - \\Omega_p$. This is the frequency range between the required passband edge and the required stopband edge. Using the expressions derived for $\\Omega_p$ and $\\Omega_s$:\n$$\\Delta\\omega = \\Omega_s - \\Omega_p = \\min\\left(\\frac{2\\pi}{L} - \\frac{\\omega_b}{L}, \\frac{\\pi}{M}\\right) - \\frac{\\omega_b}{L}$$\nThe given feasibility condition $\\omega_b/L \\leq \\pi/M$ and the inherent condition $\\omega_b  \\pi$ (which implies $2\\omega_b/L  2\\pi/L$) ensure that $\\Delta\\omega \\geq 0$.
