To understand how the spectral content of these vibrations evolves, the engineer employs a Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT).

This practice challenges you to differentiate between true frequency resolution, dictated by the analysis window's length and shape, and the sampling density of the spectrum, which is increased by zero-padding before computing the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT). Mastering this distinction is essential for the correct interpretation of STFT spectrograms and for avoiding common analytical errors [@problem_id:2903431].", "problem": "A discrete-time signal $x[n]$ is analyzed by the short-time Fourier transform (STFT), that is, by first multiplying $x[n]$ with a finite-duration window $w[n-n_{0}]$ of length $L$ at a fixed time index $n_{0}$ and then computing its frequency content. You are told that the discrete Fourier transform (DFT) used in each STFT frame is implemented either with no zero-padding or with zero-padding by an integer factor. Consider the following concrete setup for a single frame centered at $n_{0}$:\n\n- The signal in this frame is $x[n]=\\cos(\\omega_{1} n)+\\cos(\\omega_{2} n)$ with $\\omega_{1}=0.2\\pi$ and $\\omega_{2}=0.21\\pi$ (in radians per sample), and both cosines have equal amplitude.\n- The analysis window is rectangular with $w[n]=1$ for $n\\in\\{0,1,\\dots,L-1\\}$ and $w[n]=0$ otherwise, with $L=128$.\n- Two DFT configurations are considered for the windowed frame: $N_{1}=L$ (no zero-padding) and $N_{2}=Q L$ (zero-padding by factor $Q=16$), both computed by feeding the same length-$L$ windowed data and padding with zeros to the specified DFT length.\n\nYour task is to decide which statements correctly explain why zero-padding before the fast Fourier transform (FFT) in the STFT increases the sampling density in frequency without increasing true resolution, and to formalize the distinction between these two notions starting from first principles and definitions in Fourier analysis.\n\nSelect all options that are correct.\n\nA. Increasing $N$ from $N_{1}$ to $N_{2}$ narrows the mainlobe of the window’s spectral response, thereby improving the ability to resolve the two tones in a single frame.\n\nB. For fixed $x[n]$ and $w[n]$, changing $N$ only changes the frequency sampling grid $\\omega_{k}=2\\pi k/N$ at which the same continuous-frequency transform of the windowed data is evaluated; hence zero-padding increases sampling density $\\Delta\\omega=2\\pi/N$ but does not alter the underlying continuous transform.\n\nC. Zero-padding reduces spectral leakage caused by a rectangular window, because it inserts zeros that suppress sidelobes in frequency.\n\nD. Zero-padding can improve peak localization for a single sinusoid within a frame by providing more densely sampled values of the same spectrum, enabling sub-bin interpolation, even though it does not increase the ability to separate two closely spaced sinusoids when their separation is below a window-dependent width.\n\nE. For the rectangular window of length $L$, the distance between the first zeros of the window’s magnitude spectrum $|W(\\omega)|$ is $4\\pi/L$, which is independent of $N$, so the two tones at $0.2\\pi$ and $0.21\\pi$ cannot be resolved in a single frame by zero-padding alone.", "solution": "The problem requires an analysis of the effects of zero-padding in the context of the Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT), specifically discerning between frequency resolution and frequency sampling density. We must validate the provided statements based on first principles of digital signal processing.\n\nLet the discrete-time signal be $x[n]$. A single frame of the STFT is obtained by multiplying the signal by a window function $w[n]$ of length $L$. The resulting windowed signal is $y[n] = x[n]w[n]$, which is non-zero only for $n \\in \\{0, 1, \\dots, L-1\\}$, assuming the window starts at $n=0$ without loss of generality.\n\nThe continuous-frequency representation of this windowed segment is its Discrete-Time Fourier Transform (DTFT):\n$$ Y(\\omega) = \\sum_{n=-\\infty}^{\\infty} y[n] e^{-j\\omega n} = \\sum_{n=0}^{L-1} y[n] e^{-j\\omega n} $$\nThis function $Y(\\omega)$ is continuous in frequency $\\omega$. The shape of $Y(\\omega)$ is what contains all information about the spectrum of the analyzed segment, including its potential to resolve closely spaced frequency components.\n\nThe Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) is a computational tool that samples the DTFT. An $N$-point DFT of a sequence computes $N$ samples of its DTFT at the discrete frequencies $\\omega_k = \\frac{2\\pi k}{N}$ for $k \\in \\{0, 1, \\dots, N-1\\}$.\n\n**Zero-padding** is the process of appending zeros to the $L$-point sequence $y[n]$ to create a longer sequence of length $N > L$. Let this new sequence be $y_p[n]$:\n$$ y_p[n] = \\begin{cases} y[n],  0 \\le n  L \\\\ 0,  L \\le n  N \\end{cases} $$\nThe DTFT of the zero-padded sequence $y_p[n]$ is identical to the DTFT of the original sequence $y[n]$, because the added zeros do not contribute to the sum:\n$$ Y_p(\\omega) = \\sum_{n=0}^{N-1} y_p[n] e^{-j\\omega n} = \\sum_{n=0}^{L-1} y[n] e^{-j\\omega n} = Y(\\omega) $$\nTherefore, zero-padding does not change the underlying continuous spectrum $Y(\\omega)$. It only changes the set of frequencies at which this spectrum is sampled by the DFT. By increasing $N$, we decrease the spacing $\\Delta\\omega_k = 2\\pi/N$ between frequency samples, thereby obtaining a more densely sampled, or interpolated, version of the *same* continuous spectrum $Y(\\omega)$.\n\n**Frequency resolution** is the ability to distinguish between two closely spaced spectral components. In the context of the STFT, this is determined by the spreading effect of the window function. The windowing operation $y[n] = x[n]w[n]$ corresponds to convolution in the frequency domain: $Y(\\omega) = \\frac{1}{2\\pi} X(\\omega) * W(\\omega)$, where $W(\\omega)$ is the DTFT of the window $w[n]$. For a sinusoidal signal, this convolution replaces each ideal spectral impulse with a shifted replica of the window's spectrum, $W(\\omega)$. The ability to resolve two sinusoids depends on the width of the mainlobe of $W(\\omega)$.\n\nFor the given rectangular window of length $L=128$, the DTFT is $W(\\omega) = e^{-j\\omega(L-1)/2} \\frac{\\sin(\\omega L/2)}{\\sin(\\omega/2)}$. The mainlobe of its magnitude spectrum, $|W(\\omega)|$, is defined by its first nulls. These nulls occur when $\\omega L/2 = \\pm\\pi$, which means $\\omega = \\pm 2\\pi/L$. The resolution, according to the Rayleigh criterion, is the minimum frequency separation required to place the peak of one component on the first null of the other, which is $\\Delta\\omega_{\\text{res}} = 2\\pi/L$.\nFor $L=128$, this resolution is $\\Delta\\omega_{\\text{res}} = 2\\pi/128 = \\pi/64 \\approx 0.015625\\pi$.\n\nThe given signal has components at $\\omega_1 = 0.2\\pi$ and $\\omega_2 = 0.21\\pi$. Their separation is $\\Delta\\omega_{\\text{signal}} = \\omega_2 - \\omega_1 = 0.01\\pi$.\nSince $\\Delta\\omega_{\\text{signal}}  \\Delta\\omega_{\\text{res}}$, the two spectral components are not resolvable with this window length. Their mainlobes will overlap to such a degree that they appear as a single peak in the underlying continuous spectrum $Y(\\omega)$. Zero-padding, which only provides more samples of this same unresolved spectrum, cannot separate them.\n\nNow, we evaluate each statement.\n\n**A. Increasing $N$ from $N_{1}$ to $N_{2}$ narrows the mainlobe of the window’s spectral response, thereby improving the ability to resolve the two tones in a single frame.**\nThis assertion is fundamentally flawed. The spectral characteristics of the window, specifically its mainlobe width, are determined exclusively by the window's definition in the time domain—its functional form and its length $L$. The mainlobe width of the rectangular window spectrum is proportional to $1/L$. It is entirely independent of the DFT length $N$. Since zero-padding does not change $L$, it does not narrow the mainlobe or improve frequency resolution.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**B. For fixed $x[n]$ and $w[n]$, changing $N$ only changes the frequency sampling grid $\\omega_{k}=2\\pi k/N$ at which the same continuous-frequency transform of the windowed data is evaluated; hence zero-padding increases sampling density $\\Delta\\omega=2\\pi/N$ but does not alter the underlying continuous transform.**\nThis statement is a precise and correct description of the effect of zero-padding. The \"continuous-frequency transform\" is the DTFT, $Y(\\omega)$, which is determined by the windowed data $y[n]=x[n]w[n]$ and is not altered by appending zeros. The DFT simply provides samples of $Y(\\omega)$ at frequencies $\\omega_k = 2\\pi k/N$. Increasing $N$ makes the sampling grid denser, meaning the sampling interval $\\Delta\\omega = 2\\pi/N$ decreases. This does not change $Y(\\omega)$ itself.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**C. Zero-padding reduces spectral leakage caused by a rectangular window, because it inserts zeros that suppress sidelobes in frequency.**\nSpectral leakage is a direct consequence of the sidelobes in the window's spectrum, $W(\\omega)$. The height of these sidelobes is, like the mainlobe width, a function of the window's type and length $L$. A rectangular window has high sidelobes, leading to significant leakage. Zero-padding does not alter the window function or its length, and thus has no effect on the structure of $W(\\omega)$ or its sidelobes. To reduce leakage, one must choose a different window function (e.g., a Hann or Hamming window), not perform zero-padding.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. Zero-padding can improve peak localization for a single sinusoid within a frame by providing more densely sampled values of the same spectrum, enabling sub-bin interpolation, even though it does not increase the ability to separate two closely spaced sinusoids when their separation is below a window-dependent width.**\nThis statement correctly identifies a key benefit of zero-padding and contrasts it with its inability to improve resolution. If a spectral peak's true frequency does not coincide with a DFT bin, its energy is distributed among neighboring bins. By providing a denser sampling of the DTFT, zero-padding gives more points along the spectral peak's shape, allowing the maximum of these samples to be a better approximation of the true peak's frequency and magnitude. This is an improvement in \"peak localization\". The statement correctly qualifies this by affirming that this does not help resolve sinusoids whose separation is less than the resolution limit imposed by the window.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**E. For the rectangular window of length $L$, the distance between the first zeros of the window’s magnitude spectrum $|W(\\omega)|$ is $4\\pi/L$, which is independent of $N$, so the two tones at $0.2\\pi$ and $0.21\\pi$ cannot be resolved in a single frame by zero-padding alone.**\nThe first zeros of $|W(\\omega)|$ are at $\\omega = \\pm 2\\pi/L$. The distance between them, which is the mainlobe width, is indeed $(2\\pi/L) - (-2\\pi/L) = 4\\pi/L$. This width is solely dependent on $L$, not $N$. As calculated previously, the Rayleigh resolution limit is $\\Delta\\omega_{\\text{res}} = 2\\pi/L \\approx 0.015625\\pi$. The signal's frequency separation is $\\Delta\\omega_{\\text{signal}} = 0.01\\pi$. Since $\\Delta\\omega_{\\text{signal}}  \\Delta\\omega_{\\text{res}}$, the tones are unresolvable. Because resolution is independent of $N$, zero-padding cannot remedy this. The statement is entirely correct in its reasoning and conclusion.\n**Verdict: Correct.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{BDE}$$", "id": "2903431"}, {"introduction": "Having explored the STFT's properties and implementation details, we now apply it to analyze a canonical non-stationary signal: the linear chirp.
