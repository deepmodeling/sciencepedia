It is a standard problem in the theory of nonlinear systems. We may proceed with the solution.\n\nThe problem requires us to find the $p$-th order Volterra kernel, $h_p(\\tau_1, \\ldots, \\tau_p)$, for a system whose input-output relationship is described by a memoryless polynomial of degree $P$. We are given two equivalent representations for the system output $y(t)$ for an arbitrary input $x(t)$.\n\nThe first representation is the Volterra series of order $P$:\n$$ y(t) = \\sum_{p=1}^{P} \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty}\\cdots\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} h_p(\\tau_1,\\ldots,\\tau_p)\\,\\prod_{k=1}^{p} x(t-\\tau_k)\\, \\mathrm{d}\\tau_1\\cdots \\mathrm{d}\\tau_p $$\nThe second representation is the memoryless polynomial:\n$$ y(t) = \\sum_{p=1}^{P} a_p\\, x(t)^{p} $$\nThe coefficients $a_p$ are real constants, and the kernels $h_p(\\tau_1, \\ldots, \\tau_p)$ are symmetric with respect to their arguments.\n\nSince these two expressions for $y(t)$ must be identical for any input signal $x(t)$, the operators acting on $x(t)$ of each order $p$ must be equivalent. Therefore, for each integer $p$ from $1$ to $P$, we can equate the $p$-th order terms from both series:\n$$ \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty}\\cdots\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} h_p(\\tau_1,\\ldots,\\tau_p)\\,\\prod_{k=1}^{p} x(t-\\tau_k)\\, \\mathrm{d}\\tau_1\\cdots \\mathrm{d}\\tau_p = a_p\\, x(t)^{p} $$\nOur objective is to determine the distribution $h_p(\\tau_1, \\ldots, \\tau_p)$ that satisfies this identity for any $x(t)$. To achieve this, we will express the right-hand side of the equation in a form that resembles the Volterra integral operator on the left-hand side.\n\nWe utilize the sifting property of the Dirac delta distribution, $\\delta(\\tau)$, which is defined by its action as a linear functional on a space of test functions. For a continuous function $f(\\tau)$, this property is:\n$$ f(t_0) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} f(\\tau) \\delta(\\tau - t_0) \\, \\mathrm{d}\\tau $$\nApplying this property to the function $x(t-\\tau)$ with $t_0=0$, we can write $x(t)$ as:\n$$ x(t) = x(t-0) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} x(t-\\tau) \\delta(\\tau) \\, \\mathrm{d}\\tau $$\nThe term $x(t)^p$ on the right-hand side of our identity can now be expressed as a product of $p$ such integrals. To avoid confusion of integration variables, we use distinct dummy variables $\\tau_1, \\ldots, \\tau_p$ for each factor:\n$$ x(t)^p = \\left( \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} x(t-\\tau_1) \\delta(\\tau_1) \\, \\mathrm{d}\\tau_1 \\right) \\left( \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} x(t-\\tau_2) \\delta(\\tau_2) \\, \\mathrm{d}\\tau_2 \\right) \\cdots \\left( \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} x(t-\\tau_p) \\delta(\\tau_p) \\, \\mathrm{d}\\tau_p \\right) $$\nBy Fubini's theorem, we can combine this product of integrals into a single $p$-dimensional integral:\n$$ x(t)^p = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty}\\cdots\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\left( \\prod_{k=1}^{p} x(t-\\tau_k) \\delta(\\tau_k) \\right) \\, \\mathrm{d}\\tau_1\\cdots \\mathrm{d}\\tau_p $$\nRearranging the terms inside the integral, we get:\n$$ x(t)^p = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty}\\cdots\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\left( \\prod_{j=1}^{p} \\delta(\\tau_j) \\right) \\left( \\prod_{k=1}^{p} x(t-\\tau_k) \\right) \\, \\mathrm{d}\\tau_1\\cdots \\mathrmd\\tau_p $$\nNow, we substitute this integral representation back into the identity for the $p$-th order term:\n$$ \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty}\\cdots\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} h_p(\\tau_1,\\ldots,\\tau_p)\\,\\prod_{k=1}^{p} x(t-\\tau_k)\\, \\mathrm{d}\\tau_1\\cdots \\mathrm{d}\\tau_p = a_p \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty}\\cdots\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\left( \\prod_{j=1}^{p} \\delta(\\tau_j) \\right) \\left( \\prod_{k=1}^{p} x(t-\\tau_k) \\right) \\, \\mathrm{d}\\tau_1\\cdots \\mathrm{d}\\tau_p $$\nThis can be rewritten as:\n$$ \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty}\\cdots\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\left[ h_p(\\tau_1,\\ldots,\\tau_p) - a_p \\prod_{j=1}^{p} \\delta(\\tau_j) \\right] \\left( \\prod_{k=1}^{p} x(t-\\tau_k) \\right) \\, \\mathrm{d}\\tau_1\\cdots \\mathrm{d}\\tau_p = 0 $$\nThis equation must hold for any arbitrary input signal $x(t)$. The family of functions generated by $\\prod_{k=1}^{p} x(t-\\tau_k)$ is sufficiently rich that for the integral to be zero for all choices of $x(t)$, the expression in the square brackets must be zero. This is a fundamental principle in the theory of integral operators, leading to the uniqueness of the symmetric kernel. Therefore, we conclude that:\n$$ h_p(\\tau_1,\\ldots,\\tau_p) - a_p \\prod_{j=1}^{p} \\delta(\\tau_j) = 0 $$\nThis gives the explicit form of the $p$-th order Volterra kernel:\n$$ h_p(\\tau_1,\\ldots,\\tau_p) = a_p \\prod_{j=1}^{p} \\delta(\\tau_j) = a_p \\delta(\\tau_1) \\delta(\\tau_2) \\cdots \\delta(\\tau_p) $$\nWe must verify this result against the problem's conditions.\nFirst, the kernel must be symmetric. The product of univariate delta functions $\\delta(\\tau_1) \\delta(\\tau_2) \\cdots \\delta(\\tau_p)$ is invariant under any permutation of the variables $\\tau_1, \\ldots, \\tau_p$. Thus, the derived kernel is symmetric.\nSecond, we must show that the kernel is concentrated on the set where $\\tau_1=\\cdots=\\tau_p=0$. The product of delta functions $\\prod_{j=1}^{p} \\delta(\\tau_j)$ is non-zero only at the point where all arguments are simultaneously zero, i.e., at $(\\tau_1, \\ldots, \\tau_p) = (0, \\ldots, 0)$. The support of this distributional kernel is the single point set $\\{(0, \\ldots, 0)\\}$, the origin of the $\\mathbb{R}^p$ space of time-lag variables. This point trivially satisfies the condition $\\tau_1=\\cdots=\\tau_p=0$. Thus, the kernel is indeed concentrated at the origin, which proves that the system is memoryless, as expected. An effect at time $t$, $y(t)$, depends only on the input at the same instant, $x(t)$. This physical property is mathematically encoded by having Volterra kernels whose support is concentrated at the origin of the $\\tau$-space.\n\nThe derived expression is a single closed-form analytic expression for the kernel, valid for all $p=1, \\ldots, P$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{a_p \\prod_{k=1}^{p} \\delta(\\tau_k)}\n$$", "id": "2887125"}, {"introduction": "Having established the kernel representation for a memoryless system, we now add a crucial element: memory, in the form of a linear time-invariant (LTI) filter.

Summing all parts for $x^{3}[n]$ and grouping by frequency:\n- At $\\omega_{1}$: $(\\frac{3A^{3}}{4} + \\frac{3AB^{2}}{2})\\cos(\\omega_{1} n) = \\frac{3A}{4}(A^{2}+2B^{2})\\cos(\\omega_{1} n)$\n- At $\\omega_{2}$: $(\\frac{3B^{3}}{4} + \\frac{3A^{2}B}{2})\\cos(\\omega_{2} n) = \\frac{3B}{4}(B^{2}+2A^{2})\\cos(\\omega_{2} n)$\n- At $3\\omega_{1}$: $\\frac{A^{3}}{4}\\cos(3\\omega_{1} n)$\n- At $3\\omega_{2}$: $\\frac{B^{3}}{4}\\cos(3\\omega_{2} n)$\n- At $2\\omega_{1} \\pm \\omega_{2}$: $\\frac{3A^{2}B}{4}\\cos((2\\omega_{1}\\pm\\omega_{2})n)$\n- At $\\omega_{1} \\pm 2\\omega_{2}$: $\\frac{3AB^{2}}{4}\\cos((\\omega_{1}\\pm 2\\omega_{2})n)$\n\nThus, $y_{3}[n] = \\gamma x^{3}[n]$ contains third harmonics at $3\\omega_{1}$ and $3\\omega_{2}$, third-order intermodulation products at $|2\\omega_{1}-\\omega_{2}|$, $2\\omega_{1}+\\omega_{2}$, $|\\omega_{1}-2\\omega_{2}|$, and $\\omega_{1}+2\\omega_{2}$, and also contributes to the fundamental frequencies $\\omega_{1}$ and $\\omega_{2}$.\n\n**Total Output Signal, $y[n]$**\nThe total output $y[n] = y_{1}[n] + y_{2}[n] + y_{3}[n]$ is the sum of all derived components. Explicitly, the distinct angular frequencies generated are:\n$0$ (DC), $\\omega_{1}$, $\\omega_{2}$, $2\\omega_{1}$, $2\\omega_{2}$, $|\\omega_{1}-\\omega_{2}|$, $\\omega_{1}+\\omega_{2}$, $3\\omega_{1}$, $3\\omega_{2}$, $|2\\omega_{1}-\\omega_{2}|$, $2\\omega_{1}+\\omega_{2}$, $|\\omega_{1}-2\\omega_{2}|$, and $\\omega_{1}+2\\omega_{2}$.\n\nCombining all terms, the final expression for $y[n]$ is a sum of cosines. The terms at $\\omega_{1}$ and $\\omega_{2}$ receive contributions from both the first and third order parts of the series.
