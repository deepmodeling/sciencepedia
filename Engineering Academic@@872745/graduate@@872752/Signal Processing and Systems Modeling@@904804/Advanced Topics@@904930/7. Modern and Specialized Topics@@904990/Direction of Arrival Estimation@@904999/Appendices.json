It is a complete and consistent problem statement. Therefore, the problem is valid and a solution will be furnished.\n\nWe begin by modeling the phase of the signal received at each sensor. For a ULA with its axis along the $x$-axis, the position of the $n$-th sensor (for $n \\in \\{0, 1, \\dots, N-1\\}$) can be given by the vector $\\mathbf{p}_n = (nd, 0, 0)$, assuming the first sensor ($n=0$) is at the origin. A plane wave arriving from a direction $\\theta$ relative to broadside (the $y$-axis) has a unit direction vector $\\mathbf{u}(\\theta) = (\\sin(\\theta), \\cos(\\theta), 0)$ in the $xy$-plane.\n\nThe path length difference for the wave to travel to sensor $n$ relative to the reference sensor at the origin is the projection of the sensor's position vector onto the wave's direction vector:\n$$ \\Delta L_n = \\mathbf{p}_n \\cdot \\mathbf{u}(\\theta) = nd\\sin(\\theta) $$\nThis path difference corresponds to a time delay of $\\tau_n = \\frac{\\Delta L_n}{c} = \\frac{nd\\sin(\\theta)}{c}$, where $c$ is the speed of propagation. For a narrowband signal with carrier angular frequency $\\omega = 2\\pi f = \\frac{2\\pi c}{\\lambda}$, this time delay induces a phase shift relative to the reference sensor:\n$$ \\phi_n(\\theta) = -\\omega \\tau_n = -2\\pi \\frac{c}{\\lambda} \\frac{nd\\sin(\\theta)}{c} = -2\\pi n \\frac{d}{\\lambda}\\sin(\\theta) $$\nThe inter-sensor phase progression is the phase difference between any two adjacent sensors, for example, sensor $n$ and sensor $n-1$:\n$$ \\Delta\\phi(\\theta) = \\phi_n(\\theta) - \\phi_{n-1}(\\theta) = \\left(-2\\pi n \\frac{d}{\\lambda}\\sin(\\theta)\\right) - \\left(-2\\pi(n-1)\\frac{d}{\\lambda}\\sin(\\theta)\\right) = -2\\pi \\frac{d}{\\lambda}\\sin(\\theta) $$\nThis phase progression is the fundamental quantity that the array measures to distinguish directions. An alternative angle $\\theta'$ produces the same measurement as the true angle $\\theta$ if the received signal vectors are indistinguishable. This occurs if the inter-sensor phase progressions are identical up to an integer multiple of $2\\pi$, due to the periodic nature of phase. The condition is therefore:\n$$ \\Delta\\phi(\\theta') = \\Delta\\phi(\\theta) + 2\\pi k $$\nwhere $k$ is an integer. The case $k=0$ trivially leads to $\\sin(\\theta') = \\sin(\\theta)$, which implies $\\theta'=\\theta$ within the primary visible region, corresponding to the true DOA.

We must find if there are any non-zero integers $k$ that satisfy this constraint.\n\nLet's test integer values of $k \\neq 0$:\nCase $k=1$:\n$$ \\sin(\\theta') = \\sin(10^{\\circ}) - 1.25 $$\nGiven that the maximum value of $\\sin(10^{\\circ})$ is approximately $0.1736$, the result is $\\sin(\\theta') \\approx 0.1736 - 1.25 = -1.0764$. Since $-1.0764  -1$, there is no real angle $\\theta'$ that satisfies this condition.\n\nCase $k=-1$:\n$$ \\sin(\\theta') = \\sin(10^{\\circ}) - 1.25(-1) = \\sin(10^{\\circ}) + 1.25 $$\nThe result is $\\sin(\\theta') \\approx 0.1736 + 1.25 = 1.4236$. Since $1.4236  1$, there is no real angle $\\theta'$ that satisfies this condition.\n\nFor any other non-zero integer $k$, where $|k| \\ge 1$:\n$$ |\\sin(\\theta') - \\sin(10^{\\circ})| = |k \\times 1.25| \\ge 1.25 $$\nBy the reverse triangle inequality, we have:\n$$ |\\sin(\\theta')| \\geq ||\\sin(\\theta') - \\sin(10^{\\circ})| - |\\sin(10^{\\circ})|| \\ge |1.25 - \\sin(10^{\\circ})| $$\nSince $\\sin(10^{\\circ}) \\approx 0.1736$, this gives:\n$$ |\\sin(\\theta')| \\ge |1.25 - 0.1736| = 1.0764 $$\nAs $|\\sin(\\theta')| \\ge 1.0764  1$, it is impossible for $\\sin(\\theta')$ to be in the valid range of $[-1, 1]$ for any non-zero integer $k$.\n\nTherefore, for the given inter-element spacing of $d=0.8\\lambda$, the true Direction of Arrival $\\theta=10^{\\circ}$ does not produce any ambiguous replicas in the visible region $\\theta' \\in [-90^{\\circ}, 90^{\\circ}]$.

It represents a standard problem in array signal processing, specifically Direction-of-Arrival (DOA) estimation using the root-MUSIC algorithm. The provided information is sufficient and consistent for deriving a unique solution.\n\nThe task is to find the DOAs of $K=2$ signals impinging on an $N=8$ sensor Uniform Linear Array (ULA). The core of the method lies in the orthogonality between the signal steering vectors and the noise subspace. The root-MUSIC algorithm operationalizes this by finding the roots of a polynomial derived from the projection onto the noise subspace.\n\nFirst, we derive the coefficients $c_k$ of the root-MUSIC polynomial $p(z)$. The problem defines this polynomial as $p(z) = \\mathbf{a}^{\\mathsf{H}}(z) \\mathbf{P}_n \\mathbf{a}(z)$. For the purpose of finding roots, we form the standard root-MUSIC polynomial which is analytic in the complex plane, by replacing the conjugate transpose $\\mathbf{a}^{\\mathsf{H}}(z)$ with the standard transpose $\\mathbf{a}^{\\mathsf{T}}(z^{-1})$. This is equivalent on the unit circle where $z^{-1} = z^*$.\nThe polynomial is thus formulated as:\n$$\np(z) \\triangleq \\mathbf{a}^{\\mathsf{T}}(z^{-1}) \\mathbf{P}_n \\mathbf{a}(z)\n$$\nwhere $\\mathbf{a}(z) = \\begin{bmatrix} 1  z^{-1}  \\dots  z^{-7} \\end{bmatrix}^{\\mathsf{T}}$. The vector $\\mathbf{a}^{\\mathsf{T}}(z^{-1})$ is $\\begin{bmatrix} 1  z  \\dots  z^7 \\end{bmatrix}$. Expanding the polynomial expression:\n$$\np(z) = \\sum_{m=0}^{7} \\sum_{l=0}^{7} z^{m} (\\mathbf{P}_n)_{ml} z^{-l} = \\sum_{m=0}^{7} \\sum_{l=0}^{7} (\\mathbf{P}_n)_{ml} z^{m-l}\n$$\nTo match the requested form $p(z) = \\sum_{k=-7}^{7} c_k z^{-k}$, we group terms by powers of $z$. Let's first define a polynomial $P(z) = \\sum_{j=-7}^{7} C_j z^j$. Comparing with the expression above, the coefficient $C_j$ for the term $z^j$ is obtained by setting $j=m-l$:\n$$\nC_j = \\sum_{m-l=j, \\, 0 \\le m,l \\le 7} (\\mathbf{P}_n)_{ml}\n$$\nThe problem specifies that the columns of the noise subspace projection matrix $\\mathbf{E}_n$ are DFT vectors. The projection matrix is $\\mathbf{P}_n = \\mathbf{E}_n \\mathbf{E}_n^{\\mathsf{H}} = \\sum_{i \\in S_n} \\mathbf{e}_i \\mathbf{e}_i^{\\mathsf{H}}$, where $S_n=\\{0,2,3,4,5,6\\}$. The $(m,l)$-th element of $\\mathbf{P}_n$ is:\n$$\n(\\mathbf{P}_n)_{ml} = \\sum_{i \\in S_n} (\\mathbf{e}_i)_m (\\mathbf{e}_i)_l^* = \\sum_{i \\in S_n} \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{8}} \\exp\\left(-j \\frac{2\\pi}{8} i m\\right) \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{8}} \\exp\\left(j \\frac{2\\pi}{8} i l\\right) = \\frac{1}{8} \\sum_{i \\in S_n} \\exp\\left(j \\frac{\\pi}{4} i (l-m)\\right)\n$$\nThis shows that $(\\mathbf{P}_n)_{ml}$ depends only on the difference $l-m$. Thus, $\\mathbf{P}_n$ is a Toeplitz matrix. Let $r_{l-m} = (\\mathbf{P}_n)_{ml}$. Then $C_j$, the coefficient of $z^j$, is the sum of elements on the $(-j)$-th diagonal of $\\mathbf{P}_n$. Since all elements on this diagonal are equal to $r_{-j}$, and there are $8-|j|$ such elements:\n$$\nC_j = (8-|j|) r_{-j}\n$$\nThe requested polynomial is $p(z) = \\sum_{k=-7}^{7} c_k z^{-k}$. By setting $z^{-k} = z^j$, we have $j=-k$. The coefficient $c_k$ is then equal to $C_{-k}$:\n$$\nc_k = C_{-k} = (8-|-k|)r_{-(-k)} = (8-|k|)r_k\n$$\nwhere $r_k = \\frac{1}{8} \\sum_{i \\in S_n} \\exp(j \\frac{\\pi}{4} i k)$.\n\nThe DFT vectors form a complete orthonormal basis, so the projection onto the noise subspace $\\mathbf{P}_n$ and the projection onto the signal subspace $\\mathbf{P}_s$ sum to the identity matrix: $\\mathbf{P}_n + \\mathbf{P}_s = \\mathbf{I}$. The signal subspace is spanned by DFT vectors with indices in $S_s=\\{1,7\\}$.\nThus, $(\\mathbf{P}_n)_{ml} = \\delta_{ml} - (\\mathbf{P}_s)_{ml}$, where $\\delta_{ml}$ is the Kronecker delta. The diagonal elements $r_k$ of $\\mathbf{P}_n$ are:\n$$\nr_k = \\delta_{k,0} - \\frac{1}{8} \\sum_{i \\in S_s} \\exp\\left(j \\frac{\\pi}{4} i k\\right)\n$$\nSubstituting $S_s = \\{1,7\\}$:\n$$\nr_k = \\delta_{k,0} - \\frac{1}{8} \\left( \\exp\\left(j \\frac{\\pi}{4} k\\right) + \\exp\\left(j \\frac{7\\pi}{4} k\\right) \\right) = \\delta_{k,0} - \\frac{1}{8} \\left( \\exp\\left(j \\frac{\\pi}{4} k\\right) + \\exp\\left(-j \\frac{\\pi}{4} k\\right) \\right) = \\delta_{k,0} - \\frac{2}{8} \\cos\\left(\\frac{\\pi k}{4}\\right)\n$$\nSo, $r_k = \\delta_{k,0} - \\frac{1}{4}\\cos\\left(\\frac{\\pi k}{4}\\right)$. The closed-form expression for the coefficients $c_k$ is:\n$$\nc_k = (8-|k|) \\left( \\delta_{k,0} - \\frac{1}{4}\\cos\\left(\\frac{\\pi k}{4}\\right) \\right), \\quad k \\in \\{-7, \\dots, 7\\}\n$$\nThis completes the first part of the problem.\n\nFor the second part, we must find the two roots of $p(z)$ on the unit circle. The MUSIC principle states that for a true DOA angle $\\theta$, its corresponding steering vector $\\mathbf{a}(z)$ (with $z=\\exp(j\\pi\\sin\\theta)$) is orthogonal to the noise subspace. This means $\\mathbf{a}(z)$ must lie in the signal subspace.\nThe problem states that the signal subspace is spanned by the DFT vectors $\\mathbf{e}_1$ and $\\mathbf{e}_7$. A DFT vector $\\mathbf{e}_i$ has elements $(\\mathbf{e}_i)_n = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{8}}\\exp(-j\\frac{2\\pi i n}{8})$. This is proportional to a steering vector $\\mathbf{a}(z_i)$ where $z_i=\\exp(j\\frac{2\\pi i}{8})$, since $(\\mathbf{a}(z_i))_n = (z_i)^{-n} = \\exp(-j\\frac{2\\pi i n}{8})$.\nTherefore, the steering vectors corresponding to the true DOAs must be proportional to the basis vectors of the signal subspace, which are $\\mathbf{e}_1$ and $\\mathbf{e}_7$. This implies that the true signal steering vectors are precisely those corresponding to the DFT indices $1$ and $7$. The roots on the unit circle are therefore:\n$$\nz_1 = \\exp\\left(j\\frac{2\\pi \\cdot 1}{8}\\right) = \\exp\\left(j\\frac{\\pi}{4}\\right)\n$$\n$$\nz_2 = \\exp\\left(j\\frac{2\\pi \\cdot 7}{8}\\right) = \\exp\\left(j\\frac{7\\pi}{4}\\right) = \\exp\\left(-j\\frac{\\pi}{4}\\right)\n$$\nThese roots must nullify the polynomial $p(z)$, a fact which can be verified by substituting them into the expression $\\sum c_k z^{-k}$ with the coefficients derived above.\n\nFinally, we map these roots to the DOA angles $\\theta_1$ and $\\theta_2$ using the given relations $z=\\exp(j\\psi)$ and $\\psi=\\pi\\sin(\\theta)$.\nFor the root $z_1 = \\exp(j\\frac{\\pi}{4})$:\nThe phase is $\\psi_1 = \\arg(z_1) = \\frac{\\pi}{4}$.\n$$\n\\frac{\\pi}{4} = \\pi \\sin(\\theta_1) \\implies \\sin(\\theta_1) = \\frac{1}{4}\n$$\n$$\n\\theta_1 = \\arcsin\\left(\\frac{1}{4}\\right) = \\arcsin(0.25)\n$$\nFor the root $z_2 = \\exp(-j\\frac{\\pi}{4})$:\nThe phase is $\\psi_2 = \\arg(z_2) = -\\frac{\\pi}{4}$.\n$$\n-\\frac{\\pi}{4} = \\pi \\sin(\\theta_2) \\implies \\sin(\\theta_2) = -\\frac{1}{4}\n$$\n$$\n\\theta_2 = \\arcsin\\left(-\\frac{1}{4}\\right) = -\\arcsin(0.25)\n$$\nTo provide the answer in degrees, we convert from radians:\n$$\n\\theta_1 = \\arcsin(0.25) \\times \\frac{180}{\\pi} \\approx 14.47751...^{\\circ}\n$$\n$$\n\\theta_2 = -\\arcsin(0.25) \\times \\frac{180}{\\pi} \\approx -14.47751...^{\\circ}\n$$\nRounding to four significant figures, the DOAs are $\\theta_1 = 14.48^{\\circ}$ and $\\theta_2 = -14.48^{\\circ}$.

A standard choice for this parameter count is $P_k = k(2M-k)$, which represents the number of real parameters to specify a $k$-dimensional subspace in $\\mathbb{C}^M$.\n\nWe will now compute the values of AIC and MDL for $k=0, 1, 2, \\dots$ using the provided eigenvalues:\n$\\lambda = [16.00, 9.00, 4.00, 1.10, 1.08, 1.05, 1.03, 0.99, 0.98, 0.97, 0.95, 0.94]$.\n\nLet's compute the values for $k=2, 3, 4$ where the minimum is expected to lie, based on the sharp drop in eigenvalue magnitude after $\\lambda_3$.\nFor $k=2$: Number of noise eigenvalues is $M-k=10$.\n$A_2 = \\frac{1}{10}\\sum_{i=3}^{12} \\lambda_i = \\frac{13.09}{10} = 1.309$\n$G_2 = \\left(\\prod_{i=3}^{12} \\lambda_i\\right)^{1/10} \\approx 1.1725$\n$L(2) = N(M-2)\\ln(A_2/G_2) = 300 \\cdot 10 \\cdot \\ln(1.309/1.1725) \\approx 330.40$\n$P_2 = 2(2 \\cdot 12 - 2) = 44$\n$\\mathrm{AIC}(2) = 2 \\cdot L(2) + 2P_2 = 2 \\cdot 330.40 + 2 \\cdot 44 = 660.8 + 88 = 748.8$\n$\\mathrm{MDL}(2) = L(2) + \\frac{1}{2}P_2\\ln(N) = 330.40 + \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot 44 \\cdot \\ln(300) \\approx 330.40 + 125.48 = 455.88$\n\nFor $k=3$: Number of noise eigenvalues is $M-k=9$.\n$A_3 = \\frac{1}{9}\\sum_{i=4}^{12} \\lambda_i = \\frac{9.09}{9} = 1.01$\n$G_3 = \\left(\\prod_{i=4}^{12} \\lambda_i\\right)^{1/9} \\approx 1.0086$\n$L(3) = N(M-3)\\ln(A_3/G_3) = 300 \\cdot 9 \\cdot \\ln(1.01/1.0086) \\approx 3.83$\n$P_3 = 3(2 \\cdot 12 - 3) = 63$\n$\\mathrm{AIC}(3) = 2 \\cdot L(3) + 2P_3 = 2 \\cdot 3.83 + 2 \\cdot 63 = 7.66 + 126 = 133.66$\n$\\mathrm{MDL}(3) = L(3) + \\frac{1}{2}P_3\\ln(N) = 3.83 + \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot 63 \\cdot \\ln(300) \\approx 3.83 + 179.67 = 183.50$\n\nFor $k=4$: Number of noise eigenvalues is $M-k=8$.\n$A_4 = \\frac{1}{8}\\sum_{i=5}^{12} \\lambda_i = \\frac{7.99}{8} = 0.99875$\n$G_4 = \\left(\\prod_{i=5}^{12} \\lambda_i\\right)^{1/8} \\approx 0.9977$\n$L(4) = N(M-4)\\ln(A_4/G_4) = 300 \\cdot 8 \\cdot \\ln(0.99875/0.9977) \\approx 2.59$\n$P_4 = 4(2 \\cdot 12 - 4) = 80$\n$\\mathrm{AIC}(4) = 2 \\cdot L(4) + 2P_4 = 2 \\cdot 2.59 + 2 \\cdot 80 = 5.18 + 160 = 165.18$\n$\\mathrm{MDL}(4) = L(4) + \\frac{1}{2}P_4\\ln(N) = 2.59 + \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot 80 \\cdot \\ln(300) \\approx 2.59 + 228.15 = 230.74$\n\nSummarizing the results:\n- AIC values: $\\mathrm{AIC}(2)=748.8, \\mathrm{AIC}(3)=133.66, \\mathrm{AIC}(4)=165.18$.\n- MDL values: $\\mathrm{MDL}(2)=455.88, \\mathrm{MDL}(3)=183.50, \\mathrm{MDL}(4)=230.74$.\n\nBoth functions exhibit a clear minimum at $k=3$. Therefore, both criteria estimate the number of sources to be $3$.\n$$ \\widehat{K}_{\\mathrm{AIC}} = 3 $$\n$$ \\widehat{K}_{\\mathrm{MDL}} = 3 $$\n\nThe problem asks for an explanation if the estimates differ. In this case, they do not. This outcome is due to the distinct separation of the eigenvalues into two groups: $\\{\\lambda_1, \\lambda_2, \\lambda_3\\}$ are significantly larger than the noise level, while $\\{\\lambda_4, \\dots, \\lambda_{12}\\}$ are clustered around a value of $\\sigma^2 \\approx 1$. This large gap between $\\lambda_3=4.00$ and $\\lambda_4=1.10$ causes the likelihood term, $L(k)$, to drop precipitously from $L(2) \\approx 330$ to $L(3) \\approx 4$. For $k \\ge 3$, $L(k)$ remains small. The penalty terms, $2P_k$ for AIC and $\\frac{1}{2}P_k\\ln(N)$ for MDL, increase quadratically with $k$. The combination of a sharp drop in the likelihood term followed by the monotonic increase of the penalty term creates an unambiguous minimum at $k=3$ for both criteria.\n\nA discrepancy would arise if the eigenvalue decay were more gradual. The MDL penalty, containing the factor $\\ln(N)$, is more severe for larger $k$ than the AIC penalty. Consequently, MDL is a consistent estimator that favors simpler models, and it is a general property that $\\widehat{K}_{\\mathrm{MDL}} \\le \\widehat{K}_{\\mathrm{AIC}}$. If the drop in the likelihood term between $k=3$ and $k=4$ were less pronounced, it might be possible for AIC to select $k=4$ while the stricter MDL criterion would still select $k=3$.
