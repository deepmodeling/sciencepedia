Therefore, the PSD at the sampler input remains unchanged:\n$$S_{u}(f) = S_{0} \\quad \\text{for } |f| \\leq 100\\,\\mathrm{kHz}, \\text{ and } S_{u}(f) = 0 \\text{ otherwise.}$$\nThe total bandwidth of this signal is $B = 100\\,\\mathrm{kHz}$.\n\nNext, this continuous-time signal $u(t)$ is sampled by an ideal analog-to-digital converter at a sampling rate $F_{s} = 200\\,\\mathrm{kHz}$. The sampling period is $T_{s} = 1/F_{s}$. The relationship between the PSD of the continuous-time signal $S_u(f)$ and the PSD of the resulting discrete-time signal $u_d[n]$, denoted $S_{u_d}(e^{j\\Omega})$, is given by the periodic summation formula:\n$$S_{u_d}(e^{j\\Omega}) = \\frac{1}{T_{s}} \\sum_{k=-\\infty}^{\\infty} S_{u}\\left(f - kF_{s}\\right),$$\nwhere $\\Omega = 2\\pi f T_{s}$ is the normalized discrete-time frequency.

The original frequency range $[-\\pi, \\pi]$ is divided into $M$ zones. The zone $|\\Omega| \\leq \\pi/M$ becomes the new baseband without aliasing. The power from all other zones, $|\\Omega|  \\pi/M$, aliases into this baseband.

Taking the complex conjugate of both sides of this relation yields $\\overline{H(\\exp(j(-\\pi + \\delta_{k})))} = H(\\exp(j(\\pi - \\delta_{k})))$.\nSubstituting this into the expression for $D_k$:\n$$\nD_{k} = H(\\exp(j(\\pi - \\delta_{k}))) + n(\\pi - \\delta_{k}) - H(\\exp(j(\\pi - \\delta_{k}))) - \\overline{n(-\\pi + \\delta_{k})}\n$$\nThe terms involving the true DTFT $H$ cancel out, which is the principle of this diagnostic test. We are left with an expression that depends only on the measurement disturbances:\n$$\nD_{k} = n(\\pi - \\delta_{k}) - \\overline{n(-\\pi + \\delta_{k})}\n$$\nNow we compute the squared magnitude, $|D_{k}|^{2}$:\n$$\n|D_{k}|^{2} = \\left| n(\\pi - \\delta_{k}) - \\overline{n(-\\pi + \\delta_{k})} \\right|^{2}\n$$\nUsing the property $|z|^2 = z\\overline{z}$, we have:\n$$\n|D_{k}|^{2} = \\left( n(\\pi - \\delta_{k}) - \\overline{n(-\\pi + \\delta_{k})} \\right) \\left( \\overline{n(\\pi - \\delta_{k})} - n(-\\pi + \\delta_{k}) \\right)\n$$\nExpanding this product gives:\n$$\n|D_{k}|^{2} = |n(\\pi - \\delta_{k})|^{2} - n(\\pi - \\delta_{k})n(-\\pi + \\delta_{k}) - \\overline{n(-\\pi + \\delta_{k})}\\overline{n(\\pi - \\delta_{k})} + |\\overline{n(-\\pi + \\delta_{k})}|^{2}\n$$\nSince $|z|^2 = |\\overline{z}|^2$, this simplifies to:\n$$\n|D_{k}|^{2} = |n(\\pi - \\delta_{k})|^{2} + |n(-\\pi + \\delta_{k})|^{2} - \\left( n(\\pi - \\delta_{k})n(-\\pi + \\delta_{k}) + \\overline{n(\\pi - \\delta_{k})n(-\\pi + \\delta_{k})} \\right)\n$$\nNow we take the expectation of $|D_{k}|^{2}$:\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}[|D_{k}|^{2}] = \\mathbb{E}[|n(\\pi - \\delta_{k})|^{2}] + \\mathbb{E}[|n(-\\pi + \\delta_{k})|^{2}] - \\mathbb{E}[n(\\pi - \\delta_{k})n(-\\pi + \\delta_{k}) + \\overline{n(\\pi - \\delta_{k})n(-\\pi + \\delta_{k})}]\n$$\nWe are given that $\\mathbb{E}[|n(\\omega)|^{2}] = \\sigma^{2}$ for any frequency sample $\\omega$. Therefore,\n$\\mathbb{E}[|n(\\pi - \\delta_{k})|^{2}] = \\sigma^{2}$ and $\\mathbb{E}[|n(-\\pi + \\delta_{k})|^{2}] = \\sigma^{2}$.\nThe frequencies $\\omega_{k,1} = \\pi - \\delta_k$ and $\\omega_{k,2} = -\\pi + \\delta_k$ are distinct for all $k \\in \\{0, 1, \\ldots, K-1\\}$. For $k>0$, this is trivial as $\\delta_k = k\\Delta > 0$ and $K\\Delta \\ll \\pi$. For $k=0$, $\\delta_0=0$ and we have $\\omega_{0,1}=\\pi$ and $\\omega_{0,2}=-\\pi$. These are distinct frequency values in the specified interval $(-\\pi, \\pi]$.\nAccording to the problem statement, for distinct frequencies $\\omega_a \\neq \\omega_b$, the random variables $n(\\omega_a)$ and $n(\\omega_b)$ are independent. Therefore, $n(\\pi - \\delta_{k})$ and $n(-\\pi + \\delta_{k})$ are independent random variables.\nWe are also given that the disturbances are zero-mean, i.e., $\\mathbb{E}[n(\\omega)] = 0$ for all $\\omega$.\nFor the cross-term expectation, independence allows us to write:\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}[n(\\pi - \\delta_{k})n(-\\pi + \\delta_{k})] = \\mathbb{E}[n(\\pi - \\delta_{k})] \\mathbb{E}[n(-\\pi + \\delta_{k})] = 0 \\cdot 0 = 0\n$$\nSince the expectation of the cross-term is zero, the expectation of its complex conjugate is also zero. Thus, the expectation of the entire subtracted term is zero.\nSo, for each $k$, we have:\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}[|D_k|^2] = \\sigma^2 + \\sigma^2 - 0 = 2\\sigma^2\n$$\nThis result is independent of the index $k$. Now we can compute the expectation of $S_K$:\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}[S_{K}] = \\frac{1}{K} \\sum_{k=0}^{K-1} \\mathbb{E}\\left[|D_k|^2\\right] = \\frac{1}{K} \\sum_{k=0}^{K-1} 2\\sigma^2\n$$\nThe sum consists of $K$ identical terms, so the sum is $K \\cdot 2\\sigma^{2}$.\n$$\n\\mathbbE}[S_{K}] = \\frac{1}{K} (K \\cdot 2\\sigma^{2}) = 2\\sigma^{2}\n$$\nThis is the final closed-form expression for the expectation of the diagnostic statistic.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{2\\sigma^{2}}\n$$", "id": "2851316"}]}
