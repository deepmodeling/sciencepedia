The model has $p=2$ terms.\n\n**Part 1: Determination of the Annihilating Polynomial Coefficients**\n\nThe fundamental principle of Prony's method is that a signal composed of $p$ complex exponentials is annihilated by a linear predictor of order $p$. This is mathematically expressed as a homogeneous linear constant-coefficient difference equation:\n$$x[n] + a_{1}x[n-1] + \\dots + a_{p}x[n-p] = 0$$\nfor $n \\ge p$. The coefficients $a_1, \\dots, a_p$ define the Prony polynomial $P(z) = z^p + a_1 z^{p-1} + \\dots + a_p$.\n\nFor this problem, $p=2$, so the difference equation is:\n$$x[n] + a_{1}x[n-1] + a_{2}x[n-2] = 0$$\nThis equation must hold for $n \\ge 2$. We are given samples up to $x[3]$, so we can form a system of two linear equations using $n=2$ and $n=3$ to solve for the two unknown coefficients, $a_1$ and $a_2$.\n\nFor $n=2$:\n$$x[2] + a_{1}x[1] + a_{2}x[0] = 0$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$13 + a_{1}(5) + a_{2}(2) = 0 \\implies 5a_{1} + 2a_{2} = -13$$\n\nFor $n=3$:\n$$x[3] + a_{1}x[2] + a_{2}x[1] = 0$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$35 + a_{1}(13) + a_{2}(5) = 0 \\implies 13a_{1} + 5a_{2} = -35$$\n\nWe have the following system of linear equations:\n$$\n\\begin{cases}\n5a_{1} + 2a_{2} = -13 \\\\\n13a_{1} + 5a_{2} = -35\n\\end{cases}\n$$\nTo solve this system, we can use elimination. Multiply the first equation by $5$ and the second by $2$:\n$$\n\\begin{cases}\n25a_{1} + 10a_{2} = -65 \\\\\n26a_{1} + 10a_{2} = -70\n\\end{cases}\n$$\nSubtracting the first new equation from the second yields:\n$$(26a_{1} - 25a_{1}) + (10a_{2} - 10a_{2}) = -70 - (-65)$$\n$$a_{1} = -5$$\nSubstitute $a_{1} = -5$ into the first original equation:\n$$5(-5) + 2a_{2} = -13$$\n$$-25 + 2a_{2} = -13$$\n$$2a_{2} = 12$$\n$$a_{2} = 6$$\nThus, the coefficients of the annihilating polynomial are $a_{1} = -5$ and $a_{2} = 6$. The polynomial is $P(z) = z^2 - 5z + 6$.\n\n**Part 2: Determination of the Roots $z_1$ and $z_2$**\n\nThe roots of the annihilating polynomial $P(z)$ are the modes $z_k$ of the exponential model. We must find the roots of $P(z) = z^2 - 5z + 6 = 0$.\nBy factoring the quadratic polynomial, we get:\n$$(z - 2)(z - 3) = 0$$\nThe roots are $z=2$ and $z=3$. The problem requires ordering them such that $z_1  z_2$. As the roots are real, this ordering is unambiguous.\nTherefore, we have:\n$$z_{1} = 2$$\n$$z_{2} = 3$$\n\n**Part 3: Determination of the Amplitudes $c_1$ and $c_2$**\n\nThe model is now specified as $x[n] = c_{1}(2)^{n} + c_{2}(3)^{n}$. The problem asks to compute amplitudes $(c_1, c_2)$ by minimizing the least-squares error $\\sum_{n=0}^{3} |x[n] - (c_{1} z_{1}^{n} + c_{2} z_{2}^{n})|^{2}$.\nSince the problem states that the data comes from an exact two-term model and we have correctly identified the modes, the least-squares error will be zero. This implies that the model equations are satisfied exactly for all given data points. One does not need to form the full normal equations for this overdetermined system. It is sufficient to solve the system of linear equations for $(c_1, c_2)$ using any two data points. The simplest choice is to use $n=0$ and $n=1$.\n\nFor $n=0$:\n$$x[0] = c_{1}(2)^{0} + c_{2}(3)^{0} \\implies 2 = c_{1} + c_{2}$$\nFor $n=1$:\n$$x[1] = c_{1}(2)^{1} + c_{2}(3)^{1} \\implies 5 = 2c_{1} + 3c_{2}$$\n\nWe solve the $2 \\times 2$ system:\n$$\n\\begin{cases}\nc_{1} + c_{2} = 2 \\\\\n2c_{1} + 3c_{2} = 5\n\\end{cases}\n$$\nFrom the first equation, $c_{1} = 2 - c_{2}$. Substituting this into the second equation:\n$$2(2 - c_{2}) + 3c_{2} = 5$$\n$$4 - 2c_{2} + 3c_{2} = 5$$\n$$c_{2} = 1$$\nSubstituting $c_2 = 1$ back into the expression for $c_1$:\n$$c_{1} = 2 - 1 = 1$$\nThus, the amplitudes are $c_{1} = 1$ and $c_{2} = 1$.\n\nTo verify, we check if this solution correctly predicts the other data points:\nFor $n=2$: $x[2] = (1)(2)^2 + (1)(3)^2 = 4 + 9 = 13$, which is correct.\nFor $n=3$: $x[3] = (1)(2)^3 + (1)(3)^3 = 8 + 27 = 35$, which is also correct.\nThe solution is consistent with all given data.\n\nThe requested parameters are: $a_{1}=-5$, $a_{2}=6$, $z_{1}=2$, $z_{2}=3$, $c_{1}=1$, $c_{2}=1$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n-5  6  2  3  1  1\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "2889623"}, {"introduction": "Moving from deterministic signals to stochastic processes, the Autoregressive (AR) model is a cornerstone of modern spectral estimation. This practice builds crucial intuition by directly connecting the algebraic properties of an AR model to the geometric features of its power spectral density (PSD). By analyzing a second-order AR process, you will see how the location of the model's poles in the complex $z$-plane dictates the location, sharpness, and bandwidth of the corresponding spectral peaks, providing a tangible link between theory and practice [@problem_id:2889646].", "problem": "Consider a real, wide-sense stationary autoregressive of order two (AR(2)) process defined by the difference equation $x[n] + a_1 x[n-1] + a_2 x[n-2] = e[n]$, where $e[n]$ is zero-mean, white, Gaussian driving noise with variance $\\sigma_e^2 \\in (0,\\infty)$. The associated autoregressive polynomial is $A(z) = 1 + a_1 z^{-1} + a_2 z^{-2}$. The power spectral density (PSD) of an all-pole process is inversely proportional to $|A(\\exp(j\\omega))|^2$. Let the coefficients be $a_1 = -0.95$ and $a_2 = 0.9025$.\n\nUsing only first principles about the pole locations of $A(z)$, the structure of all-pole spectra, and the definition of full width at half maximum (FWHM) for spectral peaks, do the following:\n\n- Compute the two poles of $A(z)$ in the complex $z$-plane and express them in polar form.\n- Identify the frequency (in radians per sample) at which the dominant spectral peak of the PSD occurs.\n- Under the narrowband assumption appropriate for pole radius close to unity, derive from the factorized form of $A(\\exp(j\\omega))$ an analytic expression for the $3$ decibel (dB) FWHM (that is, the frequency separation between the two frequencies where the PSD falls to one-half of its peak value) around the identified peak, and then evaluate it numerically.\n\nExpress the final $3$ dB bandwidth as a single number in radians per sample and round your answer to four significant figures.

The poles of the system are the zeros of $A(z)$, found by solving the characteristic equation $z^2 + a_1 z + a_2 = 0$. For the process to be wide-sense stationary, the poles must lie inside the unit circle. With $a_1 = -0.95$ and $a_2 = 0.9025$, the stability conditions ($|a_2|  1$, $a_1 + a_2  -1$, and $a_1 - a_2  1$) are satisfied.\n\nFirst, we compute the poles. For a real AR($2$) process with complex poles, the poles form a complex conjugate pair, $p_{1,2} = r e^{\\pm j\\theta}$. The characteristic polynomial can be written as:\n$$ (z - r e^{j\\theta})(z - r e^{-j\\theta}) = z^2 - (2r\\cos\\theta)z + r^2 = z^2 + a_1 z + a_2 $$\nBy comparing coefficients, we find:\n$$ a_2 = r^2 \\implies r = \\sqrt{0.9025} = 0.95 $$\n$$ a_1 = -2r\\cos\\theta \\implies -0.95 = -2(0.95)\\cos\\theta \\implies \\cos\\theta = \\frac{1}{2} \\implies \\theta = \\frac{\\pi}{3} \\text{ radians} $$\nThe two poles are therefore:\n$$ p_1 = 0.95 e^{j\\pi/3} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad p_2 = 0.95 e^{-j\\pi/3} $$\n\nSecond, we identify the spectral peak frequency. The power spectral density (PSD) of the AR($2$) process is $P_x(\\omega) = \\frac{\\sigma_e^2}{|A(e^{j\\omega})|^2}$. The peaks in the PSD occur where the denominator is at a minimum, which happens when the point $e^{j\\omega}$ on the unit circle is closest to one of the poles. For poles close to the unit circle ($r \\approx 1$), the PSD exhibits a sharp peak at the frequency corresponding to the pole angle. Therefore, the dominant spectral peak occurs at:\n$$ \\omega_{\\text{peak}} = \\theta = \\frac{\\pi}{3} \\text{ radians per sample} $$\n\nThird, we derive and compute the 3 dB bandwidth (FWHM). The 3 dB bandwidth is the frequency width between the two points where the PSD drops to half of its peak value. This is equivalent to finding the frequencies $\\omega$ where the denominator $|A(e^{j\\omega})|^2$ is twice its minimum value. Under the narrowband assumption for a pole $p_1 = re^{j\\theta}$ with $r$ close to 1, the spectrum near $\\omega = \\theta$ is dominated by the factor $|1 - p_1 e^{-j\\omega}|^2$.
