It presents a standard, non-trivial problem in Fourier analysis that requires derivation from first principles, which is an acceptable and rigorous task. We shall proceed with the solution.\n\nThe problem requires a three-part derivation concerning the Continuous-Time Fourier Transform (CTFT) of a Gaussian pulse and its modulated form. We will address each part sequentially. The given CTFT definition is $X(\\omega) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} x(t) \\exp(-\\mathrm{j}\\omega t) \\mathrm{d}t$.\n\nFirst, we derive the closed-form expression for $X(\\omega)$, the CTFT of $x(t) = \\exp(-t^2 / (2\\sigma^2))$.\nBy definition:\n$$\nX(\\omega) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{t^2}{2\\sigma^2}\\right) \\exp(-\\mathrm{j}\\omega t) \\mathrm{d}t\n$$\nWe combine the terms in the exponent:\n$$\nX(\\omega) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{t^2}{2\\sigma^2} - \\mathrm{j}\\omega t\\right) \\mathrm{d}t\n$$\nTo evaluate this integral, we complete the square for the argument of the exponential.

This implies $\\mathrm{d}u = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}\\sigma} \\mathrm{d}t$, or $\\mathrm{d}t = \\sqrt{2}\\sigma \\mathrm{d}u$. The integration over $t$ from $-\\infty$ to $+\\infty$ corresponds to an integration path in the complex $u$-plane parallel to the real axis. Since the integrand $\\exp(-u^2)$ is an entire function (analytic everywhere in the complex plane) and decays to zero as $\\mathrm{Re}(u) \\to \\pm\\infty$, we can, by Cauchy's Integral Theorem, shift the contour of integration to the real axis without changing the value of the integral. The integral becomes:\n$$\n\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\exp(-u^2) (\\sqrt{2}\\sigma \\, \\mathrm{d}u) = \\sqrt{2}\\sigma \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\exp(-u^2) \\mathrm{d}u\n$$\nThis is a standard Gaussian integral, whose value is a known fact: $\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\exp(-u^2) \\mathrm{d}u = \\sqrt{\\pi}$.

The problem requires this derivation from first principles, without invoking transform properties.\nUsing the definition of the CTFT for $y(t)$:\n$$\nY(\\omega) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} y(t) \\exp(-\\mathrm{j}\\omega t) \\mathrm{d}t = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\left[x(t) \\exp(\\mathrm{j}\\omega_0t)\\right] \\exp(-\\mathrm{j}\\omega t) \\mathrm{d}t\n$$\nCombining the exponential terms:\n$$\nY(\\omega) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} x(t) \\exp(\\mathrm{j}\\omega_0t - \\mathrm{j}\\omega t) \\mathrm{d}t = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} x(t) \\exp(-\\mathrm{j}(\\omega - \\omega_0)t) \\mathrm{d}t\n$$\nWe recognize this integral. It has the exact same form as the integral defining $X(\\omega)$, but with the frequency variable $\\omega$ replaced by $(\\omega - \\omega_0)$.\n$$\nX(\\omega') = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} x(t) \\exp(-\\mathrm{j}\\omega' t) \\mathrm{d}t\n$$\nBy setting $\\omega' = \\omega - \\omega_0$, we see that $Y(\\omega) = X(\\omega - \\omega_0)$.\nTherefore, using our previously derived result for $X(\\omega)$, we immediately obtain the expression for $Y(\\omega)$:\n$$\nY(\\omega) = \\sigma\\sqrt{2\\pi} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\sigma^2(\\omega - \\omega_0)^2}{2}\\right)\n$$\nThis derivation uses only the definition of the CTFT as required.\n\nThird, we determine the magnitude spectrum $|Y(\\omega)|$ and analyze the effect of modulation.\nThe expression for $Y(\\omega)$ is a product of a positive real constant $\\sigma\\sqrt{2\\pi}$ (since $\\sigma0$) and a real-valued exponential function. The argument of the exponential, $-\\frac{\\sigma^2(\\omega - \\omega_0)^2}{2}$, is always real and non-positive for real $\\omega$, $\\omega_0$, and $\\sigma$. Consequently, the exponential term is always a real number in the interval $(0, 1]$. Therefore, $Y(\\omega)$ is a strictly positive real function for all $\\omega$.\nThe magnitude of a positive real number is the number itself. Thus:\n$$\n|Y(\\omega)| = Y(\\omega) = \\sigma\\sqrt{2\\pi} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\sigma^2(\\omega - \\omega_0)^2}{2}\\right)\n$$\nTo analyze the effect of modulation, we compare $|Y(\\omega)|$ with the magnitude spectrum of the original signal, $|X(\\omega)|$. From our first derivation, $X(\\omega)$ is also a positive real function, so $|X(\\omega)| = X(\\omega) = \\sigma\\sqrt{2\\pi} \\exp(-\\frac{\\sigma^2\\omega^2}{2})$.\nThe function $|X(\\omega)|$ is a Gaussian envelope centered at frequency $\\omega = 0$.\nThe function $|Y(\\omega)|$ is a Gaussian envelope of identical shape and amplitude, but centered at frequency $\\omega = \\omega_0$.\nThe relationship is simply $|Y(\\omega)| = |X(\\omega - \\omega_0)|$.\nThis demonstrates that the modulation of the time-domain signal $x(t)$ by the complex sinusoid $\\exp(\\mathrm{j}\\omega_0 t)$ results purely in a frequency shift of its spectrum by the amount $\\omega_0$. The shape of the Gaussian magnitude envelope, determined by its amplitude $\\sigma\\sqrt{2\\pi}$ and its width parameter $\\sigma$ in the exponent, is not affected in any way beyond this translation. There is no distortion, scaling, or other modification of the envelope's form.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\sigma\\sqrt{2\\pi} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\sigma^2(\\omega - \\omega_0)^2}{2}\\right)}\n$$", "id": "2861885"}, {"introduction": "The convolution theorem, which transforms a convolution operation in the time domain into a simple multiplication in the frequency domain, is arguably the most important property of the Fourier transform for systems analysis.

The problem is not trivial and requires correct application of several mathematical techniques, including complex contour integration.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is deemed valid. We proceed with a complete solution.\n\nThe problem consists of three parts. We shall address them in sequence.\n\n**Part 1: Derivation of the Frequency-Domain Convolution Property**\n\nLet $z(t) = x(t)y(t)$. We seek to find an expression for its CTFT, $Z(\\omega)$, in terms of $X(\\omega)$ and $Y(\\omega)$. By definition:\n$$Z(\\omega) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} z(t)\\,\\exp(-j \\omega t)\\,dt = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} x(t)y(t)\\,\\exp(-j \\omega t)\\,dt$$\nWe can express one of the signals, say $x(t)$, using its inverse Fourier transform representation:\n$$x(t) = \\frac{1}{2\\pi}\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} X(\\lambda)\\,\\exp(j \\lambda t)\\,d\\lambda$$\nHere, $\\lambda$ is a dummy variable of integration for frequency. Substituting this into the expression for $Z(\\omega)$:\n$$Z(\\omega) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\left( \\frac{1}{2\\pi}\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} X(\\lambda)\\,\\exp(j \\lambda t)\\,d\\lambda \\right) y(t)\\,\\exp(-j \\omega t)\\,dt$$\nWe can rearrange the terms:\n$$Z(\\omega) = \\frac{1}{2\\pi}\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} X(\\lambda) y(t)\\,\\exp(j \\lambda t)\\,\\exp(-j \\omega t)\\,d\\lambda\\,dt$$\nNow, we wish to interchange the order of integration. This step requires justification. According to Fubini's theorem, the interchange is permitted if the integral of the absolute value of the integrand over the entire domain is finite. This would require $\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} |X(\\lambda) y(t)|\\,d\\lambda\\,dt  \\infty$, which simplifies to $\\left(\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} |y(t)|\\,dt\\right) \\left(\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} |X(\\lambda)|\\,d\\lambda\\right)  \\infty$. While the first term is finite for $y(t) \\in L^1(\\mathbb{R})$, the second term is not guaranteed to be finite for an arbitrary $X(\\omega)$ corresponding to an $x(t) \\in L^1(\\mathbb{R})$. However, the resulting property holds more broadly, sometimes interpreted in the sense of distributions. For this derivation, we proceed formally, and we will find in Part 2 that for the specific functions given, the final integral is well-defined and convergent.\n\nProceeding with the interchange of integration order:\n$$Z(\\omega) = \\frac{1}{2\\pi}\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} X(\\lambda) \\left( \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} y(t)\\,\\exp(-j(\\omega - \\lambda)t)\\,dt \\right) d\\lambda$$\nWe recognize the inner integral as the definition of the Fourier transform of $y(t)$, evaluated at the frequency $\\omega - \\lambda$:\n$$\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} y(t)\\,\\exp(-j(\\omega - \\lambda)t)\\,dt = Y(\\omega - \\lambda)$$\nSubstituting this back, we obtain the desired expression:\n$$Z(\\omega) = \\frac{1}{2\\pi}\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} X(\\lambda) Y(\\omega - \\lambda) d\\lambda$$\nThis shows that multiplication in the time domain corresponds to convolution in the frequency domain, scaled by a factor of $\\frac{1}{2\\pi}$. This is the convolution integral $(X * Y)(\\omega)$, so $Z(\\omega) = \\frac{1}{2\\pi}(X * Y)(\\omega)$.\n\n**Part 2: Evaluation via Frequency-Domain Convolution**\n\nFirst, we compute the Fourier transforms of the given signals $x(t)$ and $y(t)$. For $x(t) = \\exp(-at)u(t)$ with $a0$:\n$$X(\\omega) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\exp(-at)u(t)\\,\\exp(-j\\omega t)\\,dt = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\exp(-at)\\,\\exp(-j\\omega t)\\,dt$$\n$$X(\\omega) = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\exp(-(a+j\\omega)t)\\,dt = \\left[ \\frac{\\exp(-(a+j\\omega)t)}{-(a+j\\omega)} \\right]_{0}^{\\infty}$$\nSince $a0$, the real part of the exponent's coefficient is negative, so $\\lim_{t\\to\\infty} \\exp(-at)|\\exp(-j\\omega t)| = 0$. Thus, the upper limit evaluates to $0$.\n$$X(\\omega) = 0 - \\frac{\\exp(0)}{-(a+j\\omega)} = \\frac{1}{a+j\\omega}$$\nBy identical reasoning for $y(t) = \\exp(-bt)u(t)$ with $b0$:\n$$Y(\\omega) = \\frac{1}{b+j\\omega}$$\nNow we use the result from Part 1 to compute $Z(\\omega) = \\mathcal{F}\\{x(t)y(t)\\}$:\n$$Z(\\omega) = \\frac{1}{2\\pi}\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} X(\\lambda) Y(\\omega - \\lambda) d\\lambda = \\frac{1}{2\\pi}\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{a+j\\lambda} \\cdot \\frac{1}{b+j(\\omega-\\lambda)} d\\lambda$$\nTo evaluate this integral, we employ the method of residues from complex analysis.

We have $d\\lambda = \\frac{ds}{j}$.\n$$Z(\\omega) = \\frac{1}{2\\pi} \\int_{-j\\infty}^{j\\infty} \\frac{1}{a+s} \\cdot \\frac{1}{b+j\\omega-s} \\frac{ds}{j} = \\frac{1}{2\\pi j} \\int_{-j\\infty}^{j\\infty} \\frac{1}{(s+a)(b+j\\omega-s)} ds$$\nLet the integrand in the complex $s$-plane be $g(s) = \\frac{1}{(s+a)(b+j\\omega-s)}$. This function has two simple poles:\n1. $s_1 = -a$\n2. $s_2 = b+j\\omega$\nSince $a0$, the pole $s_1$ is in the left half-plane (LHP). Since $b0$, the real part of $s_2$ is positive, so $s_2$ is in the right half-plane (RHP).\n\nWe can evaluate the integral along the imaginary axis by closing the contour. Let us choose a contour $C_L$ in the LHP, consisting of the segment from $-jR$ to $jR$ along the imaginary axis and a semicircle $\\Gamma_L$ of radius $R$ in the LHP, centered at the origin. The contour is traversed counter-clockwise. For large $|s|$, $|g(s)| \\sim \\frac{1}{|s|^2}$. Therefore, the integral over the semicircle $\\Gamma_L$ vanishes as $R \\to \\infty$ by Jordan's Lemma.\n$$\\lim_{R\\to\\infty} \\int_{\\Gamma_L} g(s) ds = 0$$\nThe integral along the closed contour $C_L$ is given by the residue theorem:\n$$\\oint_{C_L} g(s) ds = 2\\pi j \\sum (\\text{Residues inside } C_L)$$\nThe only pole inside $C_L$ is $s_1 = -a$. The residue of $g(s)$ at this pole is:\n$$\\text{Res}(g(s), s_1=-a) = \\lim_{s\\to -a} (s+a) g(s) = \\lim_{s\\to -a} \\frac{1}{b+j\\omega-s} = \\frac{1}{b+j\\omega-(-a)} = \\frac{1}{a+b+j\\omega}$$\nTherefore, $\\oint_{C_L} g(s) ds = 2\\pi j \\left( \\frac{1}{a+b+j\\omega} \\right)$.\nSince the integral over the arc vanishes, the integral along the imaginary axis is equal to the integral over the closed contour:\n$$\\int_{-j\\infty}^{j\\infty} g(s) ds = \\frac{2\\pi j}{a+b+j\\omega}$$\nFinally, we substitute this back into our expression for $Z(\\omega)$:\n$$Z(\\omega) = \\frac{1}{2\\pi j} \\left( \\frac{2\\pi j}{a+b+j\\omega} \\right) = \\frac{1}{a+b+j\\omega}$$\n\n**Part 3: Direct Time-Domain Calculation and Comparison**\n\nWe now compute the CTFT of $z(t) = x(t)y(t)$ directly.\n$$z(t) = (\\exp(-at)u(t))(\\exp(-bt)u(t)) = \\exp(-at)\\exp(-bt)u(t)^2$$\nSince $u(t)^2 = u(t)$, we have:\n$$z(t) = \\exp(-(a+b)t)u(t)$$\nThis signal has the same form as $x(t)$ and $y(t)$, with the decay parameter being $a+b$. Since $a0$ and $b0$, it follows that $a+b0$. We can therefore find its CTFT by direct analogy with the calculation for $X(\\omega)$, replacing $a$ with $(a+b)$:\n$$Z(\\omega) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\exp(-(a+b)t)u(t) \\exp(-j\\omega t) dt = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\exp(-((a+b)+j\\omega)t) dt$$\n$$Z(\\omega) = \\left[ \\frac{\\exp(-((a+b)+j\\omega)t)}{-((a+b)+j\\omega)} \\right]_{0}^{\\infty}$$\nAs before, the term at the upper limit $t\\to\\infty$ is zero because $a+b0$.\n$$Z(\\omega) = 0 - \\frac{1}{-((a+b)+j\\omega)} = \\frac{1}{(a+b)+j\\omega}$$\nThis result is identical to the one obtained in Part 2. The consistency of the results validates both the frequency-domain convolution property and our specific calculations.\n\nThe final answer is the closed-form expression for the CTFT of the product signal $x(t)y(t)$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{1}{a+b+j\\omega}}$$", "id": "2861880"}]}
