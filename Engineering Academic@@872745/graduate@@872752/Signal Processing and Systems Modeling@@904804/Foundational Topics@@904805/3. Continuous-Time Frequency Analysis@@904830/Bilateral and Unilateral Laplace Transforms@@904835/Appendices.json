The ROC is the left-half plane $\\text{Re}(s)  0$.\n\n**Analysis and Contrast**\n\nThe poles of all four transforms $X_{k}(s)$ are located at $s = \\pm jb$. These locations are determined by the complex exponential components $\\exp(\\pm jbt)$ that constitute the sinusoidal signals. The Laplace transform of a pure complex exponential $\\exp(a_0 t)$ has a pole at $s=a_0$. Here, the sinusoidal signals are linear combinations of complex exponentials with $a_0 = \\pm jb$, so the poles are at $s = \\pm jb$. The multiplication by a step function does not alter the location of these poles; it only determines the region of convergence.\n\nThe signals $x_{1}(t)$ and $x_{2}(t)$ are right-sided, as they are non-zero only for $t \\ge 0$. Correspondingly, their ROCs, $\\text{Re}(s)  0$, are right-half planes. The vertical line $\\text{Re}(s)=0$ that forms the boundary of the ROC is determined by the real part of the poles. Since the poles $\\pm jb$ lie on this boundary, the ROC is the open half-plane to the right of the poles.\n\nConversely, the signals $x_{3}(t)$ and $x_{4}(t)$ are left-sided, as they are non-zero only for $t \\le 0$. Their ROCs, $\\text{Re}(s)  0$, are left-half planes. The ROC is the open half-plane to the left of the poles.\n\nThis demonstrates a fundamental property of the bilateral Laplace transform: right-sided signals have ROCs that are right-half planes (or extend to the right from the rightmost pole), while left-sided signals have ROCs that are left-half planes (or extend to the left from the leftmost pole). The poles themselves are intrinsic to the behavior of the function over time, independent of its duration.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{s}{s^2+b^2}  \\frac{b}{s^2+b^2}  -\\frac{s}{s^2+b^2}  -\\frac{b}{s^2+b^2} \\end{pmatrix}}$$", "id": "2854548"}, {"introduction": "While the bilateral transform is a powerful tool for general system analysis, the unilateral transform is uniquely suited for solving initial-value problems.

Therefore, the Region of Convergence is the open half-plane $\\operatorname{Re}(s)  -1$.\n\n**Part 2: Inverse Transform by Partial Fraction Expansion**\nThe given transform is $X(s) = \\frac{2s+5}{(s+1)(s+2)^2}$. We express this function using partial fraction decomposition. The presence of a simple pole at $s=-1$ and a repeated pole of order $2$ at $s=-2$ dictates the form:\n$$\nX(s) = \\frac{A}{s+1} + \\frac{B}{s+2} + \\frac{C}{(s+2)^2}.\n$$\nTo find the coefficients $A$, $B$, and $C$, we clear the denominator:\n$$\n2s+5 = A(s+2)^2 + B(s+1)(s+2) + C(s+1).\n$$\nThis equation is a polynomial identity, valid for all $s$. We determine the coefficients without using a pre-memorized derivative formula.\n\nFirst, we find the coefficient $A$ for the simple pole by multiplying by $(s+1)$ and evaluating at $s=-1$:\n$$\nA = \\left. (s+1)X(s) \\right|_{s=-1} = \\left. \\frac{2s+5}{(s+2)^2} \\right|_{s=-1} = \\frac{2(-1)+5}{(-1+2)^2} = \\frac{3}{1} = 3.\n$$\nNext, we find the coefficient $C$ of the highest-order term for the repeated pole by multiplying by $(s+2)^2$ and evaluating at $s=-2$:\n$$\nC = \\left. (s+2)^2 X(s) \\right|_{s=-2} = \\left. \\frac{2s+5}{s+1} \\right|_{s=-2} = \\frac{2(-2)+5}{-2+1} = \\frac{1}{-1} = -1.\n$$\nTo find the remaining coefficient $B$, we substitute the known values of $A$ and $C$ into the polynomial identity and evaluate at a convenient point, for example $s=0$:\n$$\n2(0)+5 = A(0+2)^2 + B(0+1)(0+2) + C(0+1)\n$$\n$$\n5 = A(4) + B(2) + C(1).\n$$\nSubstituting $A=3$ and $C=-1$:\n$$\n5 = (3)(4) + 2B + (-1)\n$$\n$$\n5 = 12 + 2B - 1\n$$\n$$\n5 = 11 + 2B \\implies 2B = -6 \\implies B = -3.\n$$\nThus, the partial fraction expansion is:\n$$\nX(s) = \\frac{3}{s+1} - \\frac{3}{s+2} - \\frac{1}{(s+2)^2}.\n$$\nNow we compute the inverse Laplace transform term by term, using standard transform pairs consistent with a causal signal.\nThe inverse transform of $\\frac{1}{s+a}$ is $\\exp(-at)u(t)$.\nThe inverse transform of $\\frac{1}{(s+a)^2}$ is $t\\exp(-at)u(t)$.\nApplying these to our expression:\n$$\nx(t) = \\mathcal{L}^{-1}\\left\\{\\frac{3}{s+1}\\right\\} - \\mathcal{L}^{-1}\\left\\{\\frac{3}{s+2}\\right\\} - \\mathcal{L}^{-1}\\left\\{\\frac{1}{(s+2)^2}\\right\\}\n$$\n$$\nx(t) = 3\\exp(-t)u(t) - 3\\exp(-2t)u(t) - t\\exp(-2t)u(t).\n$$\nCombining the terms, we get for $t \\ge 0$:\n$$\nx(t) = (3\\exp(-t) - 3\\exp(-2t) - t\\exp(-2t))u(t).\n$$\n\n**Part 3: Inverse Transform by Bromwich Integral and Residue Theorem**\nThe inverse Laplace transform is given by the Bromwich integral:\n$$\nx(t) = \\frac{1}{2\\pi \\mathrm{i}} \\int_{\\gamma - \\mathrm{i}\\infty}^{\\gamma + \\mathrm{i}\\infty} X(s) \\exp(s t) ds,\n$$\nwhere the path of integration $\\operatorname{Re}(s) = \\gamma$ lies within the ROC. Since the ROC is $\\operatorname{Re}(s)  -1$, we can choose any $\\gamma  -1$.\nFor $t \\ge 0$, we close the integration contour with a semicircular arc in the left half-plane. By Jordan's lemma, the integral over this arc vanishes as its radius tends to infinity, because $|X(s)| \\to 0$ as $|s| \\to \\infty$. The integral is then given by the sum of the residues of the integrand $f(s) = X(s)\\exp(st)$ at the poles enclosed by the contour. The enclosed poles are $s=-1$ and $s=-2$.\nBy the residue theorem:\n$$\nx(t) = \\sum \\operatorname{Res} \\left[ X(s) \\exp(st) \\right]_{\\text{at enclosed poles}}.\n$$\nThe integrand is $f(s) = \\frac{(2s+5)\\exp(st)}{(s+1)(s+2)^2}$.\n\n1.  Residue at the simple pole $s=-1$:\n    $$\n    \\operatorname{Res}_{s=-1}[f(s)] = \\lim_{s \\to -1} (s+1) f(s) = \\lim_{s \\to -1} \\frac{(2s+5)\\exp(st)}{(s+2)^2}\n    $$\n    $$\n    = \\frac{(2(-1)+5)\\exp(-t)}{(-1+2)^2} = \\frac{3\\exp(-t)}{1^2} = 3\\exp(-t).\n    $$\n2.  Residue at the pole $s=-2$ of order $m=2$:\n    We use the general formula for a residue at a pole of order $m$:\n    $$\n    \\operatorname{Res}_{s=s_0}[f(s)] = \\frac{1}{(m-1)!} \\lim_{s \\to s_0} \\frac{d^{m-1}}{ds^{m-1}} \\left[ (s-s_0)^m f(s) \\right].\n    $$\n    Here, $s_0=-2$ and $m=2$.\n    $$\n    \\operatorname{Res}_{s=-2}[f(s)] = \\frac{1}{(2-1)!} \\lim_{s \\to -2} \\frac{d}{ds} \\left[ (s+2)^2 \\frac{(2s+5)\\exp(st)}{(s+1)(s+2)^2} \\right]\n    $$\n    $$\n    = \\lim_{s \\to -2} \\frac{d}{ds} \\left[ \\frac{(2s+5)\\exp(st)}{s+1} \\right].\n    $$\n    Applying the quotient rule for differentiation:\n    $$\n    \\frac{d}{ds} \\left[ \\frac{u(s)}{v(s)} \\right] = \\frac{u'(s)v(s) - u(s)v'(s)}{[v(s)]^2},\n    $$\n    with $u(s) = (2s+5)\\exp(st)$ and $v(s)=s+1$.\n    $u'(s) = 2\\exp(st) + (2s+5)t\\exp(st) = (2+t(2s+5))\\exp(st)$.\n    $v'(s) = 1$.\n    The derivative is:\n    $$\n    \\frac{(2+t(2s+5))\\exp(st)(s+1) - (2s+5)\\exp(st)(1)}{(s+1)^2}.\n    $$\n    Evaluating the limit as $s \\to -2$:\n    $$\n    \\operatorname{Res}_{s=-2}[f(s)] = \\frac{(2+t(2(-2)+5))\\exp(-2t)(-2+1) - (2(-2)+5)\\exp(-2t)}{(-2+1)^2}\n    $$\n    $$\n    = \\frac{(2+t(1))\\exp(-2t)(-1) - (1)\\exp(-2t)}{(-1)^2}\n    $$\n    $$\n    = \\frac{(-2-t)\\exp(-2t) - \\exp(-2t)}{1} = (-2-t-1)\\exp(-2t) = (-3-t)\\exp(-2t).\n    $$\nFor $t \\ge 0$, the inverse transform is the sum of the residues:\n$$\nx(t) = \\operatorname{Res}_{s=-1}[f(s)] + \\operatorname{Res}_{s=-2}[f(s)] = 3\\exp(-t) + (-3-t)\\exp(-2t)\n$$\n$$\nx(t) = 3\\exp(-t) - 3\\exp(-2t) - t\\exp(-2t).\n$$\nFor $t  0$, the contour is closed in the right half-plane, which contains no poles.
