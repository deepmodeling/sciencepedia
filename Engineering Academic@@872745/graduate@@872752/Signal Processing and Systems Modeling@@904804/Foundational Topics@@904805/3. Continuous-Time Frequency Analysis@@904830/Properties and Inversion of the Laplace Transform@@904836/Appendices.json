A solution will be derived in accordance with the specified constraints.\n\nThe solution proceeds by directly applying the definition of the bilateral Laplace transform to the given signal $f(t)$.\n\nThe Laplace transform $F(s)$ is given by the integral:\n$$\nF(s) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} f(t)\\,\\exp(-s t)\\,dt\n$$\nSubstituting the expression for the signal $f(t) = \\exp(a t)\\,u(t)$:\n$$\nF(s) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\exp(a t)\\,u(t)\\,\\exp(-s t)\\,dt\n$$\nThe unit step function $u(t)$ is zero for $t  0$ and one for $t \\ge 0$. This property reduces the interval of integration from $(-\\infty, \\infty)$ to $[0, \\infty)$:\n$$\nF(s) = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\exp(a t)\\,(1)\\,\\exp(-s t)\\,dt\n$$\nWe combine the exponential terms in the integrand:\n$$\nF(s) = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\exp\\left((a - s)t\\right)\\,dt\n$$\nThis is an improper integral of a complex exponential function. The antiderivative of $\\exp\\left((a - s)t\\right)$ with respect to $t$ is $\\frac{1}{a-s}\\exp\\left((a - s)t\\right)$, provided $a-s \\neq 0$. Evaluating this integral gives:\n$$\nF(s) = \\left[ \\frac{\\exp\\left((a - s)t\\right)}{a-s} \\right]_{t=0}^{t \\to \\infty} = \\frac{1}{a-s} \\left( \\lim_{t \\to \\infty} \\exp\\left((a - s)t\\right) - \\exp(0) \\right)\n$$\nThe evaluation depends on the convergence of the limit term. The problem states that the transform is defined by the absolutely convergent integral. We must therefore determine the condition for absolute convergence. The integral converges absolutely if:\n$$\n\\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\left| \\exp\\left((a - s)t\\right) \\right| \\,dt  \\infty\n$$\nUsing the property that for any complex number $z$, $|\\exp(z)| = \\exp(\\Re(z))$, we have:\n$$\n\\left| \\exp\\left((a - s)t\\right) \\right| = \\exp\\left(\\Re\\left((a-s)t\\right)\\right)\n$$\nSince $t$ is a real, non-negative variable in the integration interval, we can write:\n$$\n\\exp\\left(\\Re\\left((a-s)t\\right)\\right) = \\exp\\left( (\\Re(a) - \\Re(s))t \\right)\n$$\nThe absolute convergence condition becomes:\n$$\n\\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\exp\\left( (\\Re(a) - \\Re(s))t \\right) \\,dt  \\infty\n$$\nThis is an integral of a real exponential function. This integral converges if and only if the coefficient of $t$ in the exponent is strictly negative. Thus, we require:\n$$\n\\Re(a) - \\Re(s)  0\n$$\nThis inequality simplifies to:\n$$\n\\Re(s)  \\Re(a)\n$$\nThis inequality defines the Region of Convergence (ROC). It is the open right half-plane in the complex $s$-plane, to the right of the vertical line defined by $\\Re(s) = \\Re(a)$.\n\nNow we can complete the evaluation of $F(s)$. The condition $\\Re(s)  \\Re(a)$ ensures that the limit $\\lim_{t \\to \\infty} \\exp\\left((a - s)t\\right)$ evaluates to $0$. This is because the magnitude of the term, $|\\exp\\left((a - s)t\\right)| = \\exp\\left( (\\Re(a) - \\Re(s))t \\right)$, tends to $0$ as $t \\to \\infty$ since its exponent's coefficient is negative.\nWith this condition, the expression for $F(s)$ becomes:\n$$\nF(s) = \\frac{1}{a-s} (0 - 1) = -\\frac{1}{a-s} = \\frac{1}{s-a}\n$$\nThis completes part (1) of the problem.\n\nFor part (2), we must determine the abscissa of convergence, $\\sigma_c$. The problem statement defines the ROC as the set $\\{\\; s \\in \\mathbb{C}\\,:\\,\\Re(s)  \\sigma_c \\;\\}$. From our derivation, the ROC is the set $\\{\\; s \\in \\mathbb{C}\\,:\\,\\Re(s)  \\Re(a) \\;\\}$. By direct comparison, we identify the abscissa of convergence as:\n$$\n\\sigma_c = \\Re(a)\n$$\nThis completes part (2).\n\nFor part (3), we interpret the result. The magnitude of the signal $f(t)$ for $t \\ge 0$ is given by $|f(t)| = |\\exp(at)| = \\exp(\\Re(a)t)$. The term $\\Re(a)$ represents the exponential growth rate of the signal's envelope. If $\\Re(a)  0$, the signal grows exponentially. If $\\Re(a)  0$, it decays. If $\\Re(a) = 0$, it has a constant-amplitude envelope.\nThe Laplace transform integral involves the product $f(t)\\exp(-st)$. The magnitude of this product is $|f(t)\\exp(-st)| = \\exp(\\Re(a)t) \\exp(-\\Re(s)t) = \\exp((\\Re(a)-\\Re(s))t)$. For the integral $\\int_0^\\infty |f(t)\\exp(-st)| dt$ to converge, the integrand must decay to zero as $t \\to \\infty$. This requires the overall exponential rate, $\\Re(a) - \\Re(s)$, to be negative. Thus, we need $\\Re(s)  \\Re(a)$. This means the exponential decay rate $\\Re(s)$ provided by the transform kernel $\\exp(-st)$ must be greater than the signal's own growth rate $\\Re(a)$ to ensure the product is an overall decaying function of time, making its integral over $[0, \\infty)$ finite.\nThe boundary line $\\Re(s) = \\sigma_c = \\Re(a)$ is excluded from the ROC precisely because absolute convergence fails on this line. If $\\Re(s) = \\Re(a)$, the integral for absolute convergence becomes:\n$$\n\\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\exp\\left( (\\Re(a) - \\Re(a))t \\right) \\,dt = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\exp(0) \\,dt = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} 1 \\,dt\n$$\nThis integral diverges to infinity. Therefore, the Laplace transform integral does not converge absolutely on the boundary of the ROC. The definition of the ROC for the bilateral Laplace transform is conventionally taken as the open set where absolute convergence holds, which guarantees the analyticity of $F(s)$ within that region.\n\nThe final answer consists of the closed-form expression for $F(s)$ and the value of $\\sigma_c$.\n$F(s) = \\frac{1}{s-a}$\n$\\sigma_c = \\Re(a)$", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n\\frac{1}{s-a}  \\Re(a)\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "2894454"}, {"introduction": "While direct integration is fundamental, most practical inversion problems involve rational functions, for which partial fraction expansion is the method of choice.

Region of Convergence (ROC)**\n\nThe given Laplace transform is $F(s)=\\frac{1}{s\\bigl(1-\\exp(-sT)\\bigr)}$. The term $\\frac{1}{1-\\exp(-sT)}$ is recognizable as the sum of a geometric series. Specifically, the series $\\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} r^k$ converges to $\\frac{1}{1-r}$ if and only if its common ratio $r$ satisfies $|r|1$.\n\nIn our case, the common ratio is $r = \\exp(-sT)$. We require $|\\exp(-sT)|  1$. Let the complex variable $s$ be written as $s = \\sigma + j\\omega$, where $\\sigma = \\operatorname{Re}(s)$ and $\\omega = \\operatorname{Im}(s)$ are real numbers. The condition becomes:\n$$\n|\\exp(-(\\sigma + j\\omega)T)|  1\n$$\nUsing properties of the exponential function:\n$$\n|\\exp(-\\sigma T) \\exp(-j\\omega T)| = |\\exp(-\\sigma T)| \\cdot |\\exp(-j\\omega T)|  1\n$$\nThe magnitude of a complex exponential with a purely imaginary argument is always $1$: $|\\exp(-j\\omega T)| = \\sqrt{\\cos^2(-\\omega T) + \\sin^2(-\\omega T)} = 1$. The expression $\\exp(-\\sigma T)$ is real since $\\sigma$ and $T$ are real. The condition simplifies to:\n$$\n\\exp(-\\sigma T)  1\n$$\nSince the exponential function $\\exp(x)$ is strictly increasing, we can take the natural logarithm of both sides without changing the inequality's direction.\n$$\n\\ln(\\exp(-\\sigma T))  \\ln(1)\n$$\n$$\n-\\sigma T  0\n$$\nGiven that $T0$, we can divide by $-T$ and reverse the inequality sign:\n$$\n\\sigma  0\n$$\nThus, the region of convergence for the geometric series, and hence for $F(s)$, is the right half-plane $\\operatorname{Re}(s)  0$.\n\nFor any $s$ in this ROC, we can write $F(s)$ as an infinite series:\n$$\nF(s) = \\frac{1}{s} \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} \\left(\\exp(-sT)\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{s} \\exp(-skT)\n$$\nThe inverse Laplace transform is a linear operator.

This ensures that the corresponding sum of time-domain functions converges to the correct inverse transform $f(t)$.\n\n**2. Inverse Laplace Transform of $F(s)$**\n\nWe shall find $f(t) = \\mathcal{L}^{-1}\\{F(s)\\}$ by applying the linearity and time-shift properties to the series representation derived above.\n$$\nf(t) = \\mathcal{L}^{-1}\\left\\{ \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{s} \\exp(-skT) \\right\\} = \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} \\mathcal{L}^{-1}\\left\\{ \\frac{\\exp(-skT)}{s} \\right\\}\n$$\nWe use two fundamental results:\n- The inverse Laplace transform of $G(s) = \\frac{1}{s}$ is the unit step function, $g(t) = u(t)$.\n- The time-shift property states that for a constant $a \\ge 0$, $\\mathcal{L}^{-1}\\{\\exp(-as)G(s)\\} = g(t-a)u(t-a)$. When $g(t)$ is already causal, as $u(t)$ is, this simplifies to $g(t-a)$.\n\nLet us apply this to each term in the sum. For the $k$-th term, we have the transform $\\frac{\\exp(-skT)}{s}$. Here, the shift is $a=kT$. Since $k \\ge 0$ and $T0$, the shift $kT$ is non-negative. The function to be shifted is $\\mathcal{L}^{-1}\\{\\frac{1}{s}\\} = u(t)$.\nTherefore, the inverse transform of the $k$-th term is:\n$$\n\\mathcal{L}^{-1}\\left\\{ \\frac{\\exp(-skT)}{s} \\right\\} = u(t-kT)\n$$\nSumming over all $k \\ge 0$ gives the time-domain expression for $f(t)$:\n$$\nf(t) = \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} u(t-kT)\n$$\nThis function is a staircase function. For any given $t$, the argument of the step function, $t-kT$, is non-negative only for $k \\le \\frac{t}{T}$. The sum is therefore finite for any finite $t$. For $t \\in [nT, (n+1)T)$ where $n$ is a non-negative integer, exactly $n+1$ terms (for $k=0, 1, \\dots, n$) are equal to $1$, yielding $f(t)=n+1$.\n\n**3. Periodicity of $f(t)$**\n\nA signal $g(t)$ is periodic with period $P0$ if $g(t+P)=g(t)$ for all $t \\in \\mathbb{R}$. We test if our-derived signal $f(t) = \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} u(t-kT)$ satisfies this condition for any $P0$.\nLet's choose a simple value for $t$, for example $t=0$.\n$f(0) = u(0) + u(-T) + u(-2T) + \\dots = 1 + 0 + 0 + \\dots = 1$.\nNow, consider $f(0+P) = f(P)$. As $P0$, there is some non-negative integer $n$ such that $P \\in [nT, (n+1)T)$. The value of the function is $f(P) = n+1$. For periodicity, we would require $f(P)=f(0)$, which means $n+1=1$, implying $n=0$. This restricts any potential period $P$ to the interval $(0, T)$.\nLet us test such a $P \\in (0, T)$. Consider $t=T-P$. Note that $t=(T-P) \\in (0,T)$.\n$f(t) = f(T-P) = 1$.\nNow, $f(t+P) = f((T-P)+P) = f(T) = u(T) + u(0) + u(-T) + \\dots = 1+1+0+\\dots = 2$.\nSince $f(t+P)=2$ and $f(t)=1$, we have $f(t+P) \\neq f(t)$.\nThe signal $f(t)$ is a monotonically non-decreasing function for $t \\ge 0$. It is not constant, and therefore cannot be periodic.\nConclusion: The signal $f(t)$ is not periodic.\n\n**4. Causality of $f(t)$**\n\nA signal $g(t)$ is causal if $g(t)=0$ for all $t0$. We will establish causality from two perspectives.\n\n- **From the time-domain expression for $f(t)$**:\nOur expression is $f(t) = \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} u(t-kT)$. The unit step function $u(\\tau)$ is zero for $\\tau  0$. Each term $u(t-kT)$ is therefore zero if $t-kT  0$, which is equivalent to $t  kT$.\nIn the summation, the index $k$ takes non-negative integer values $k=0, 1, 2, \\dots$. The constant $T$ is given as $T0$. Thus, the product $kT$ is always non-negative ($kT \\ge 0$).\nIf we consider any time $t0$, the condition $tkT$ is satisfied for all $k \\ge 0$.\nConsequently, for any $t0$, every term $u(t-kT)$ in the summation is zero. The sum is therefore zero.\n$$\nf(t) = \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} 0 = 0 \\quad \\text{for all } t0.\n$$\nBy definition, the signal $f(t)$ is causal.\n\n- **From the Region of Convergence of $F(s)$**:\nThe problem states that $f(t)$ is a right-sided signal. For right-sided signals, the ROC of the Laplace transform is a right half-plane of the form $\\operatorname{Re}(s)  \\sigma_{\\text{max}}$, where $\\sigma_{\\text{max}}$ is the real part of the rightmost pole of $F(s)$.\nA right-sided signal is causal if and only if its ROC is a right half-plane to the right of all its poles and includes $\\operatorname{Re}(s)  0$.\nThe poles of $F(s) = \\frac{1}{s(1-\\exp(-sT))}$ are the values of $s$ for which the denominator is zero. This occurs if $s=0$ or $1-\\exp(-sT)=0$.\nThe condition $1-\\exp(-sT)=0$ implies $\\exp(-sT)=1$. Writing $s=\\sigma+j\\omega$, this is $\\exp(-\\sigma T)\\exp(-j\\omega T)=1$. Taking the magnitude gives $\\exp(-\\sigma T)=1$, which for $T0$ requires $\\sigma=0$. The phase condition $\\exp(-j\\omega T)=1$ implies $-\\omega T = 2\\pi n$ for some integer $n$. Thus, the poles are at $s_n = j\\frac{2\\pi n}{T}$ for $n \\in \\mathbb{Z}$.\nThese poles all lie on the imaginary axis ($\\operatorname{Re}(s)=0$). The pole at $s=0$ has order $2$, as $\\lim_{s \\to 0} s^2 F(s) = \\lim_{s \\to 0} \\frac{s}{1-\\exp(-sT)} = \\lim_{s \\to 0} \\frac{1}{T\\exp(-sT)} = \\frac{1}{T} \\neq 0$.\nThe rightmost real part of any pole is $\\sigma_{\\text{max}}=0$.\nWe determined the ROC to be $\\operatorname{Re}(s)0$. This region is indeed the half-plane to the right of all poles. For a right-sided signal, this property is equivalent to causality. The analysis confirms $f(t)$ is causal.\nThe final expression for $f(t)$ is the summation of shifted unit step functions.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} u(t-kT)}\n$$", "id": "2894380"}]}
