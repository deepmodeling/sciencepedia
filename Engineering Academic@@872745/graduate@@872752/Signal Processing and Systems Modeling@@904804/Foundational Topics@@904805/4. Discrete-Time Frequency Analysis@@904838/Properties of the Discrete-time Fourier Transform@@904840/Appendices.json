It is a well-posed, scientifically grounded problem from the field of signal processing that can be solved from first principles as requested. I will proceed with a full derivation.\n\nThe DTFT of the sequence $x[n]$ is given by the definition:\n$$\nX(e^{j\\omega}) = \\sum_{n=-\\infty}^{\\infty} x[n] e^{-j\\omega n}\n$$\nGiven the definition of $x[n]$, the sequence is non-zero only for $n$ from $0$ to $N-1$, where its value is $1$. Therefore, the infinite summation reduces to a finite one:\n$$\nX(e^{j\\omega}) = \\sum_{n=0}^{N-1} (1) \\cdot e^{-j\\omega n} = \\sum_{n=0}^{N-1} (e^{-j\\omega})^n\n$$\nThis is a finite geometric series of the form $\\sum_{k=0}^{M-1} r^k$, with $M=N$ and the common ratio $r = e^{-j\\omega}$.\n\nThe sum of a finite geometric series is given by the formula:\n$$\n\\sum_{k=0}^{M-1} r^k = \\frac{1 - r^M}{1 - r}\n$$\nThis formula is valid for any complex number $r$ such that $r \\neq 1$.\n\nFirst, consider the case where $r = 1$. This occurs when $e^{-j\\omega} = 1$, which implies that $\\omega$ is an integer multiple of $2\\pi$, i.e., $\\omega = 2\\pi k$ for $k \\in \\mathbb{Z}$. In this specific case, the summation becomes:\n$$\nX(e^{j(2\\pi k)}) = \\sum_{n=0}^{N-1} (e^{-j2\\pi k})^n = \\sum_{n=0}^{N-1} (1)^n = \\sum_{n=0}^{N-1} 1 = N\n$$\nNow, for the general case where $r \\neq 1$, which means $\\omega \\neq 2\\pi k$ for any $k \\in \\mathbb{Z}$, we apply the geometric series formula with $r = e^{-j\\omega}$ and $M = N$:\n$$\nX(e^{j\\omega}) = \\frac{1 - (e^{-j\\omega})^N}{1 - e^{-j\\omega}} = \\frac{1 - e^{-j\\omega N}}{1 - e^{-j\\omega}}\n$$\nTo express this result in the required form of a real amplitude term multiplied by a linear-phase term, we employ a standard algebraic manipulation. We factor out a term from the numerator and the denominator to create expressions that can be related to the sine function using Euler's identity.\n\nFactor out $e^{-j\\omega N/2}$ from the numerator and $e^{-j\\omega/2}$ from the denominator:\n$$\nX(e^{j\\omega}) = \\frac{e^{-j\\omega N/2} (e^{j\\omega N/2} - e^{-j\\omega N/2})}{e^{-j\\omega/2} (e^{j\\omega/2} - e^{-j\\omega/2})}\n$$\nThe complex exponential term simplifies to:\n$$\n\\frac{e^{-j\\omega N/2}}{e^{-j\\omega/2}} = e^{-j\\omega \\frac{N}{2} + j\\omega \\frac{1}{2}} = e^{-j\\omega \\frac{N-1}{2}}\n$$\nThis is the linear-phase term, as its phase, $\\phi(\\omega) = -\\omega(N-1)/2$, is a linear function of $\\omega$.\n\nNext, we use Euler's formula, which states that $\\sin(\\theta) = \\frac{e^{j\\theta} - e^{-j\\theta}}{2j}$. This implies $e^{j\\theta} - e^{-j\\theta} = 2j\\sin(\\theta)$. Applying this to the remaining parts of the expression:\n- For the numerator term: $e^{j\\omega N/2} - e^{-j\\omega N/2} = 2j\\sin(\\omega N/2)$.\n- For the denominator term: $e^{j\\omega/2} - e^{-j\\omega/2} = 2j\\sin(\\omega/2)$.\n\nSubstitute these back into the expression for $X(e^{j\\omega})$:\n$$\nX(e^{j\\omega}) = e^{-j\\omega \\frac{N-1}{2}} \\frac{2j\\sin(\\omega N/2)}{2j\\sin(\\omega/2)}\n$$\nThe $2j$ terms in the numerator and denominator cancel out, yielding the purely real amplitude term. Combining the parts, we get:\n$$\nX(e^{j\\omega}) = e^{-j\\omega \\frac{N-1}{2}} \\frac{\\sin(\\omega N/2)}{\\sin(\\omega/2)}\n$$\nThis expression is valid for $\\omega \\neq 2\\pi k$. We must verify that the limit of this expression as $\\omega \\to 2\\pi k$ matches the value $N$ that we derived by direct summation. By periodicity, we only need to check the limit as $\\omega \\to 0$. We use the small-angle approximation $\\sin(x) \\approx x$ for $x \\to 0$, or more formally, L'Hôpital's rule:\n$$\n\\lim_{\\omega \\to 0} X(e^{j\\omega}) = \\left(\\lim_{\\omega \\to 0} e^{-j\\omega \\frac{N-1}{2}}\\right) \\left(\\lim_{\\omega \\to 0} \\frac{\\sin(\\omega N/2)}{\\sin(\\omega/2)}\\right)\n$$\nThe first limit is $1$. For the second limit:\n$$\n\\lim_{\\omega \\to 0} \\frac{\\sin(\\omega N/2)}{\\sin(\\omega/2)} = \\lim_{\\omega \\to 0} \\frac{\\frac{d}{d\\omega} \\sin(\\omega N/2)}{\\frac{d}{d\\omega} \\sin(\\omega/2)} = \\lim_{\\omega \\to 0} \\frac{(N/2)\\cos(\\omega N/2)}{(1/2)\\cos(\\omega/2)} = \\frac{(N/2)\\cos(0)}{(1/2)\\cos(0)} = N\n$$\nThe limit as $\\omega \\to 0$ is $N$, which is consistent with the direct summation result. Thus, the derived expression, interpreted as a continuous function by defining its value at the removable singularities by its limit, is valid for all $\\omega \\in \\mathbb{R}$.\n\nThe final expression is the product of the linear-phase term $e^{-j\\omega(N-1)/2}$ and the real-valued amplitude function $\\frac{\\sin(\\omega N/2)}{\\sin(\\omega/2)}$, which is known as the periodic sinc function or the Dirichlet kernel.

The magnitude of the common ratio is:\n$$|r| = |a e^{-j\\omega}| = |a| |e^{-j\\omega}|$$\nThe term $|e^{-j\\omega}|$ is the magnitude of a complex exponential with a purely imaginary argument.

The magnitude is maximized when the denominator is minimized. This occurs when $\\cos(\\theta_a - \\omega) = 1$, which means $\\omega = \\theta_a + 2k\\pi$ for any integer $k$. At these frequencies, the maximum magnitude is $|X|_{max} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - 2|a| + |a|^2}} = \\frac{1}{1-|a|}$. As $|a|$ approaches $1$, this maximum value approaches infinity, and the peak in the spectrum becomes sharper.\n3.  **Dependence on $\\arg(a) = \\theta_a$**: The parameter $\\theta_a$ determines the location of the spectral features. As shown above, the magnitude spectrum has its maximum at frequencies $\\omega = \\theta_a + 2k\\pi$.

Let us assume that there exists a Bounded-Input Bounded-Output (BIBO) stable linear time-invariant (LTI) system with an impulse response $h[n]$ whose DTFT is given by $H(e^{j\\omega}) = j\\omega$ over the principal interval $\\omega \\in (-\\pi, \\pi]$.\n\nAccording to the problem statement, two fundamental properties must hold for such a system:\n$1$. For an LTI system to be BIBO-stable, its impulse response $h[n]$ must be absolutely summable. That is, the sum $S = \\sum_{n=-\\infty}^{\\infty} |h[n]|$ must be finite, $S  \\infty$.\n$2$. For any absolutely summable sequence $h[n]$, its DTFT, defined as $H(e^{j\\omega}) = \\sum_{n=-\\infty}^{\\infty} h[n] e^{-j\\omega n}$, is necessarily a continuous and $2\\pi$-periodic function of the angular frequency $\\omega$.\n\nThe DTFT is inherently periodic with period $2\\pi$, meaning $H(e^{j\\omega}) = H(e^{j(\\omega+2\\pi)})$ for all $\\omega$. We are given the target frequency response $H(e^{j\\omega}) = j\\omega$ on the interval $(-\\pi, \\pi]$. We must consider the periodic extension of this function to all real $\\omega$. Let us denote this periodic function as $H_p(e^{j\\omega})$.\n\nIf the system were BIBO-stable, $H_p(e^{j\\omega})$ would have to be continuous for all $\\omega$. Let us examine the continuity of $H_p(e^{j\\omega})$ at the boundary points of the principal interval, for instance, at $\\omega = \\pi$.\nFor a function to be continuous at a point, its left-hand limit, right-hand limit, and value at the point must all exist and be equal.\n\nThe left-hand limit of $H_p(e^{j\\omega})$ as $\\omega$ approaches $\\pi$ is:\n$$\n\\lim_{\\omega \\to \\pi^-} H_p(e^{j\\omega}) = \\lim_{\\omega \\to \\pi^-} j\\omega = j\\pi\n$$\nDue to the $2\\pi$-periodicity, the right-hand limit at $\\omega = \\pi$ must be equal to the right-hand limit at $\\omega = \\pi - 2\\pi = -\\pi$.\n$$\n\\lim_{\\omega \\to \\pi^+} H_p(e^{j\\omega}) = \\lim_{\\omega \\to -\\pi^+} H_p(e^{j\\omega})\n$$\nWithin the interval $(-\\pi, \\pi]$, the function is defined as $j\\omega$.
