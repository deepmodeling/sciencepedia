First, we factor the denominator. Let $w = z^{-1}$. The denominator is $1 - \\frac{3}{4}w + \\frac{1}{8}w^2$. The roots of this quadratic are found by solving $\\frac{1}{8}w^2 - \\frac{3}{4}w + 1 = 0$, or $w^2 - 6w + 8 = 0$. This factors as $(w-2)(w-4)=0$, giving roots $w_1=2$ and $w_2=4$.\nThe poles of $H(z)$ are the values of $z$ for which $z^{-1}$ equals a root of the denominator polynomial. Thus, the poles are $p_1 = w_1^{-1} = \\frac{1}{2}$ and $p_2 = w_2^{-1} = \\frac{1}{4}$.\nThe factored form of the denominator is $(1 - \\frac{1}{2}z^{-1})(1 - \\frac{1}{4}z^{-1})$. Let's verify: $(1 - \\frac{1}{2}z^{-1})(1 - \\frac{1}{4}z^{-1}) = 1 - \\frac{1}{4}z^{-1} - \\frac{1}{2}z^{-1} + \\frac{1}{8}z^{-2} = 1 - \\frac{3}{4}z^{-1} + \\frac{1}{8}z^{-2}$. This is correct.\nSo, we can write $H(z)$ as:\n$$H(z) = \\frac{1 + \\frac{1}{2}z^{-1}}{(1 - \\frac{1}{2}z^{-1})(1 - \\frac{1}{4}z^{-1})}$$\nWe expand this into partial fractions:\n$$H(z) = \\frac{A}{1 - \\frac{1}{2}z^{-1}} + \\frac{B}{1 - \\frac{1}{4}z^{-1}}$$\nThe coefficients (residues of the expansion) are found as follows:\n$$A = \\left.\\left(1 - \\frac{1}{2}z^{-1}\\right)H(z)\\right|_{z^{-1}=2} = \\left.\\frac{1 + \\frac{1}{2}z^{-1}}{1 - \\frac{1}{4}z^{-1}}\\right|_{z^{-1}=2} = \\frac{1 + \\frac{1}{2}(2)}{1 - \\frac{1}{4}(2)} = \\frac{2}{1 - \\frac{1}{2}} = 4$$\n$$B = \\left.\\left(1 - \\frac{1}{4}z^{-1}\\right)H(z)\\right|_{z^{-1}=4} = \\left.\\frac{1 + \\frac{1}{2}z^{-1}}{1 - \\frac{1}{2}z^{-1}}\\right|_{z^{-1}=4} = \\frac{1 + \\frac{1}{2}(4)}{1 - \\frac{1}{2}(4)} = \\frac{3}{1 - 2} = -3$$\nThus, the system function is:\n$$H(z) = \\frac{4}{1 - \\frac{1}{2}z^{-1}} - \\frac{3}{1 - \\frac{1}{4}z^{-1}}$$\n\n**Causal Realization**\nA causal LTI system has an impulse response $h[n]$ that is zero for $n  0$. Such a sequence is called right-sided. The ROC for a right-sided sequence is the exterior of a circle passing through the outermost pole. The poles are at $z=\\frac{1}{2}$ and $z=\\frac{1}{4}$. The outermost pole is at $z=\\frac{1}{2}$. Therefore, the ROC for the causal system is $|z|  \\frac{1}{2}$.\n\nWe use the geometric series formula, which is a direct consequence of the z-transform definition. For a right-sided geometric sequence $x[n] = a^n u[n]$, the z-transform is:\n$$X(z) = \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} a^n z^{-n} = \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} (az^{-1})^n = \\frac{1}{1-az^{-1}}$$\nThis series converges if and only if $|az^{-1}|  1$, which defines the ROC as $|z|  |a|$.\n\nApplying this to our terms in $H(z)$:\n1. The term $\\frac{4}{1 - \\frac{1}{2}z^{-1}}$ has $a=\\frac{1}{2}$. For it to correspond to a right-sided sequence, its ROC must be $|z|  \\frac{1}{2}$. This is consistent with the overall causal ROC. Its inverse transform is $4(\\frac{1}{2})^n u[n]$.\n2. The term $\\frac{-3}{1 - \\frac{1}{4}z^{-1}}$ has $a=\\frac{1}{4}$. For it to correspond to a right-sided sequence, its ROC must be $|z|  \\frac{1}{4}$. The overall ROC $|z|  \\frac{1}{2}$ is a subset of this region, so this term also corresponds to a right-sided sequence. Its inverse transform is $-3(\\frac{1}{4})^n u[n]$.\n\nThe ROC for the sum of two sequences is the intersection of their individual ROCs. The intersection of $|z|  \\frac{1}{2}$ and $|z|  \\frac{1}{4}$ is $|z|  \\frac{1}{2}$. This confirms the consistency of our choice. The impulse response for the causal system is the sum of the inverse transforms:\n$$h_{causal}[n] = 4\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^n u[n] - 3\\left(\\frac{1}{4}\\right)^n u[n]$$\n\n**Anticausal Realization**\nAn anticausal LTI system has an impulse response $h[n]$ that is zero for $n  -1$. The problem asks for the impulse response based on a left-sided geometric series. A purely left-sided sequence, where $h[n]=0$ for $n \\ge 0$, is a special case of an anitcausal sequence. The ROC for such a system is the interior of a circle passing through the innermost pole. The innermost pole is at $z=\\frac{1}{4}$. Therefore, the ROC for the anticausal system is $|z|  \\frac{1}{4}$.\n\nWe derive the z-transform for a left-sided sequence $x[n] = -a^n u[-n-1]$. This sequence is non-zero only for $n \\le -1$.\n$$X(z) = \\sum_{n=-\\infty}^{-1} (-a^n) z^{-n} = -\\sum_{k=1}^{\\infty} a^{-k}z^{k} = -\\sum_{k=1}^{\\infty} (a^{-1}z)^k$$\nThis is a geometric series that converges if $|a^{-1}z|  1$, which defines the ROC as $|z|  |a|$. The sum is:\n$$X(z) = -\\frac{a^{-1}z}{1-a^{-1}z} = -\\frac{z/a}{1-z/a} = -\\frac{z}{a-z} = \\frac{z}{z-a} = \\frac{1}{1-az^{-1}}$$\nSo, the transform pair is $\\mathcal{Z}\\{-a^n u[-n-1]\\} = \\frac{1}{1-az^{-1}}$, with ROC $|z|  |a|$.\n\nApplying this to our terms in $H(z)$:\n1. The term $\\frac{4}{1 - \\frac{1}{2}z^{-1}}$ has $a=\\frac{1}{2}$. For it to correspond to a left-sided sequence, its ROC must be $|z|  \\frac{1}{2}$. The overall anticausal ROC $|z|  \\frac{1}{4}$ is a subset of this region. Its inverse transform is $4 \\times (-(\\frac{1}{2})^n u[-n-1]) = -4(\\frac{1}{2})^n u[-n-1]$.\n2. The term $\\frac{-3}{1 - \\frac{1}{4}z^{-1}}$ has $a=\\frac{1}{4}$. For it to correspond to a left-sided sequence, its ROC must be $|z|  \\frac{1}{4}$. This is consistent with the overall anticausal ROC. Its inverse transform is $-3 \\times (-(\\frac{1}{4})^n u[-n-1]) = 3(\\frac{1}{4})^n u[-n-1]$.\n\nThe ROC for the overall anticausal system is the intersection of the individual ROCs $|z|  \\frac{1}{2}$ and $|z|  \\frac{1}{4}$, which is $|z|  \\frac{1}{4}$. This choice makes the entire impulse response left-sided. The impulse response for the anticausal system is:\n$$h_{anticausal}[n] = -4\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^n u[-n-1] + 3\\left(\\frac{1}{4}\\right)^n u[-n-1]$$\nThis can be written as:\n$$h_{anticausal}[n] = \\left(-4\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^n + 3\\left(\\frac{1}{4}\\right)^n\\right) u[-n-1]$$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} \\left(4\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^n - 3\\left(\\frac{1}{4}\\right)^n\\right)u[n]  \\left(-4\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^n + 3\\left(\\frac{1}{4}\\right)^n\\right)u[-n-1] \\end{pmatrix}}$$", "id": "2897318"}, {"introduction": "This exercise integrates the concepts of system representation and transform properties into a complete analysis of a Linear Time-Invariant (LTI) system.

The poles of $H(z)$ are the roots of the denominator polynomial, found by setting $1 - \\frac{1}{2}z^{-1} = 0$, which yields $z = \\frac{1}{2}$.\n-   The system is **causal**. For a rational transfer function, causality implies that the impulse response $h[n]$ is right-sided, and the ROC must be the exterior of a circle passing through the outermost pole. Here, this implies the ROC is $|z| > \\frac{1}{2}$.\n-   The system is **BIBO stable**. For an LTI system, stability requires that the ROC of $H(z)$ includes the unit circle, $|z|=1$.\nThe region $|z| > \\frac{1}{2}$ contains the unit circle. Thus, both conditions are satisfied, and the ROC for $H(z)$ is unambiguously determined to be $|z| > \\frac{1}{2}$.\n\n**2.

We find its $z$-transform using linearity.\n$$X(z) = \\mathcal{Z}\\{\\delta[n-3]\\} - \\mathcal{Z}\\left\\{\\left(\\frac{4}{5}\\right)^{n}u[n]\\right\\}$$\nFor the first term, the transform of the Kronecker delta is $\\mathcal{Z}\\{\\delta[n]\\} = 1$. Using the time-shift property:\n$$\\mathcal{Z}\\{\\delta[n-3]\\} = z^{-3}$$\nThe ROC for this term is the entire $z$-plane except for $z=0$.\n\nFor the second term, we use the standard transform pair for a right-sided exponential sequence: $\\mathcal{Z}\\{a^n u[n]\\} = \\frac{1}{1-az^{-1}}$ with ROC $|z| > |a|$. For $a = \\frac{4}{5}$:\n$$\\mathcal{Z}\\left\\{\\left(\\frac{4}{5}\\right)^{n}u[n]\\right\\} = \\frac{1}{1 - \\frac{4}{5}z^{-1}}$$\nThe ROC for this term is $|z| > \\frac{4}{5}$.\n\nCombining the two terms, we have:\n$$X(z) = z^{-3} - \\frac{1}{1 - \\frac{4}{5}z^{-1}}$$\nThe ROC of $X(z)$ is the intersection of the individual ROCs: $(\\mathbb{C} \\setminus \\{0\\}) \\cap \\{z \\in \\mathbb{C} : |z| > \\frac{4}{5}\\}$. The intersection is simply $|z| > \\frac{4}{5}$.\n\n**3. Derivation of the Output Transform $Y(z)$ and its ROC**\n\nNow we compute $Y(z) = H(z)X(z)$:\n$$Y(z) = \\left(\\frac{1 + \\frac{1}{4}z^{-1}}{1 - \\frac{1}{2}z^{-1}}\\right) \\left(z^{-3} - \\frac{1}{1 - \\frac{4}{5}z^{-1}}\\right)$$\nThe ROC of $Y(z)$ is the intersection of the ROCs of $H(z)$ and $X(z)$, provided there is no pole-zero cancellation on the boundary of the intersection.\n$$ROC_Y = ROC_H \\cap ROC_X = \\{z \\in \\mathbb{C} : |z| > \\frac{1}{2}\\} \\cap \\{z \\in \\mathbb{C} : |z| > \\frac{4}{5}\\}$$\nSince $\\frac{4}{5} > \\frac{1}{2}$, the intersection is $|z| > \\frac{4}{5}$. This is consistent with the fact that the output $y[n]$ is a right-sided sequence (as it results from a causal system with a right-sided input), for which the ROC must be the exterior of the outermost pole of $Y(z)$. The poles of $Y(z)$ are the union of the poles of $H(z)$ and $X(z)$, which are at $z=\\frac{1}{2}$ and $z=\\frac{4}{5}$. The outermost pole is at $z=\\frac{4}{5}$, so the ROC is indeed $|z| > \\frac{4}{5}$.\n\nTo find the final closed-form expression for $Y(z)$, we combine the terms into a single rational function.
