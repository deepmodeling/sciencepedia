The derivation must first establish a general relationship between $Y(z)$ and $X(z)$, and then apply this relationship to the specific signal using a partial fraction expansion technique.\n\nFirst, we establish the general relationship between the $Z$-transform of a signal $x[n]$ and its decimated version $y[n] = x[Mn]$. The bilateral $Z$-transform of $y[n]$ is defined as:\n$$\nY(z) = \\sum_{n=-\\infty}^{\\infty} y[n] z^{-n}\n$$\nSubstituting $y[n] = x[Mn]$ into the definition, we have:\n$$\nY(z) = \\sum_{n=-\\infty}^{\\infty} x[Mn] z^{-n}\n$$\nThis sum cannot be directly related to $X(z) = \\sum_{k=-\\infty}^{\\infty} x[k] z^{-k}$ because the summation index is $n$, while the argument of $x$ is $Mn$. To proceed, we introduce an auxiliary signal $v[n]$ which is zero everywhere except at integer multiples of $M$:\n$$\nv[n] = \\begin{cases} x[n] & \\text{if } n = kM \\text{ for some integer } k \\\\ 0 & \\text{otherwise} \\end{cases}\n$$\nThe decimated signal $y[n]$ is then a compressed version of $v[n]$, specifically $y[n] = v[Mn]$. Let us find the $Z$-transform of $v[n]$, denoted $V(z)$:\n$$\nV(z) = \\sum_{n=-\\infty}^{\\infty} v[n] z^{-n} = \\sum_{k=-\\infty}^{\\infty} x[kM] z^{-kM}\n$$\nBy comparing this with the expression for $Y(z)$, we can see that:\n$$\nV(z) = \\sum_{k=-\\infty}^{\\infty} x[Mk] (z^M)^{-k} = Y(z^M)\n$$\nNow we relate $V(z)$ to $X(z)$. The signal $v[n]$ can be expressed as the product of $x[n]$ and a pulse train sequence $p[n]$ that is $1$ at multiples of $M$ and $0$ otherwise. This pulse train can be represented using the $M$-th roots of unity:\n$$\np[n] = \\frac{1}{M} \\sum_{k=0}^{M-1} (e^{j \\frac{2\\pi k}{M}})^n\n$$\nThus, $v[n] = x[n] p[n]$.

Therefore:\n$$\nV(z) = \\frac{1}{M} \\sum_{k=0}^{M-1} X(z e^{-j \\frac{2\\pi k}{M}})\n$$\nSince $Y(z^M) = V(z)$, we can find $Y(z)$ by replacing $z$ with $z^{1/M}$ in the expression for $V(z)$, using the principal branch for the root as specified:\n$$\nY(z) = V(z^{1/M}) = \\frac{1}{M} \\sum_{k=0}^{M-1} X(z^{1/M} e^{-j \\frac{2\\pi k}{M}})\n$$\nThis is the general expression for the $Z$-transform of a decimated signal.\n\nNext, we apply this result to the specific signal $x[n] = a^n u[n]$ with $|a|<1$.

Let $w_k = z^{1/M} e^{-j \\frac{2\\pi k}{M}}$.

Let $c = a z^{-1/M}$ and $\\omega_k = e^{j \\frac{2\\pi k}{M}}$ for $k=0, 1, \\dots, M-1$. The sum is $\\sum_{k=0}^{M-1} \\frac{1}{1 - c \\omega_k}$.\nConsider the polynomial $P(s) = s^M - c^M$. Its roots are $s_k = c \\omega_k$ for $k=0, \\dots, M-1$.\nWe can write the partial fraction expansion of the rational function $\\frac{g(s)}{P(s)}$.

Using the formula $A_k = \\frac{g(s_k)}{P'(s_k)}$:\n$$\nA_k = \\frac{M s^{M-1}}{\\frac{d}{ds}(s^M - c^M)} \\bigg|_{s=c\\omega_k} = \\frac{M s^{M-1}}{M s^{M-1}} \\bigg|_{s=c\\omega_k} = 1\n$$\nAll coefficients are $A_k = 1$. Thus, we have the identity:\n$$\n\\frac{M s^{M-1}}{s^M - c^M} = \\sum_{k=0}^{M-1} \\frac{1}{s - c \\omega_k}\n$$\nTo match the form of our sum, we can manipulate this identity. Let us set $s=1$:\n$$\n\\frac{M}{1 - c^M} = \\sum_{k=0}^{M-1} \\frac{1}{1 - c \\omega_k}\n$$\nThis expression is exactly the sum we need to evaluate, multiplied by $M$. Therefore:\n$$\n\\sum_{k=0}^{M-1} \\frac{1}{1 - c \\omega_k} = \\frac{M}{1 - c^M}\n$$\nSubstituting this back into the expression for $Y(z)$:\n$$\nY(z) = \\frac{1}{M} \\left( \\frac{M}{1 - c^M} \\right) = \\frac{1}{1 - c^M}\n$$\nFinally, we substitute back $c = a z^{-1/M}$:\n$$\nc^M = (a z^{-1/M})^M = a^M (z^{-1/M})^M = a^M z^{-1}\n$$\nThis gives the closed-form expression for $Y(z)$:\n$$\nY(z) = \\frac{1}{1 - a^M z^{-1}}\n$$\nThis result is consistent with the direct calculation of the $Z$-transform of $y[n] = x[Mn] = a^{Mn}u[Mn] = (a^M)^n u[n]$, which is a geometric sequence with ratio $a^M$.

The decimation is by a factor of $M=3$, so $y[m] = x[3m]$.\n\nThe definition of $Y[q]$ is:\n$$Y[q] = \\sum_{m=0}^{3} y[m] \\exp\\left(-j \\frac{2\\pi}{4}qm\\right)$$\nSubstitute the definition of $y[m]$:\n$$Y[q] = \\sum_{m=0}^{3} x[3m] \\exp\\left(-j \\frac{\\pi}{2}qm\\right)$$\nNow, substitute the inverse DFT expression for $x[n]$ with $n=3m$:\n$$x[3m] = \\frac{1}{12} \\sum_{k=0}^{11} X[k] \\exp\\left(j \\frac{2\\pi}{12}k(3m)\\right) = \\frac{1}{12} \\sum_{k=0}^{11} X[k] \\exp\\left(j \\frac{\\pi}{2}km\\right)$$\nSubstituting this into the expression for $Y[q]$ gives a double summation:\n$$Y[q] = \\sum_{m=0}^{3} \\left( \\frac{1}{12} \\sum_{k=0}^{11} X[k] \\exp\\left(j \\frac{\\pi}{2}km\\right) \\right) \\exp\\left(-j \\frac{\\pi}{2}qm\\right)$$\nWe can combine the exponentials and switch the order of summation:\n$$Y[q] = \\frac{1}{12} \\sum_{k=0}^{11} X[k] \\left( \\sum_{m=0}^{3} \\exp\\left(j \\frac{\\pi}{2}(k-q)m\\right) \\right)$$\nThe inner summation is a geometric series.

The sum of the geometric series is $\\frac{r^4-1}{r-1}$, where $r = \\exp(j \\frac{\\pi}{2}(k-q))$.

The tedious numerical calculation involving the specific values of $X[k]$ would only serve to confirm this logical conclusion. For example, to find $Y[0]$, one would compute $y[m]$ for $m \\in \\{0, 1, 2, 3\\}$, sum them, and find this sum to be identical to $\\widehat{Y}[0]$ derived from $X[0], X[4], X[8]$. The consistency is built into the mathematical structure of the DFT and the decimation process itself. The instructions to perform the synthesis and separate analysis path constitute a thorough verification protocol, and a proper execution of this protocol must mathematically lead to a zero error. No numerical approximation is involved, so the computed error must be exactly zero.\nThe specific numerical values of $X[k]$ are irrelevant to the final value of $E$, as the identity $Y[q] = \\widehat{Y}[q]$ holds for any arbitrary $X[k]$.

This condition is:\n$$\\left|\\frac{\\omega - 2\\pi k}{M}\\right| \\le \\frac{\\pi}{M} \\implies |\\omega - 2\\pi k| \\le \\pi$$\nGiven that $\\omega \\in (-\\pi, \\pi]$:\n-   For $k=0$: $|\\omega| \\le \\pi$, which is true for all $\\omega$ in its domain. Thus, the $k=0$ term is always included in the sum.\n-   For $k \\in \\{1, 2, \\dots, M-1\\}$: The term $2\\pi k$ is a multiple of $2\\pi$. The distance from $\\omega$ to $2\\pi k$ is minimized when $k=1$ and $\\omega=\\pi$, where $|\\pi - 2\\pi| = \\pi$. For any other $\\omega \\in (-\\pi, \\pi)$ and any $k \\ge 1$, we have $|\\omega - 2\\pi k| > \\pi$. At the boundary point $\\omega=\\pi$, the condition $|\\pi - 2\\pi k| \\le \\pi$ is only met for $k=1$. However, this is a single point of measure zero and does not affect the integral properties of the PSD. At $\\omega=-\\pi$ (not included in the problem domain, but as a limit), $|\\-\\pi - 2\\pi k| > \\pi$. Thus, for all practical purposes over the continuous frequency domain, only the $k=0$ term contributes. This is the explicit function of the ideal anti-aliasing filter: to eliminate all aliasing components.\n\nThe sum therefore collapses to a single term corresponding to $k=0$:\n$$S_{y}\\!\\left(e^{j\\omega}\\right) = \\frac{1}{M} S_{v}\\!\\left(e^{j\\frac{\\omega}{M}}\\right)$$\nThe frequency argument for $S_{v}$ is now $\\frac{\\omega}{M}$. Since $\\omega \\in (-\\pi, \\pi]$, we have $\\frac{\\omega}{M} \\in (-\\frac{\\pi}{M}, \\frac{\\pi}{M}]$. This range is entirely within the passband $[-\\frac{\\pi}{M}, \\frac{\\pi}{M}]$ of the anti-aliasing filter. Therefore, we can use the expression for $S_{v}$ in its passband:\n$$S_{v}\\!\\left(e^{j\\frac{\\omega}{M}}\\right) = S_{x}\\!\\left(e^{j\\frac{\\omega}{M}}\\right) = \\frac{\\sigma_{w}^{2}}{1 - 2\\rho\\cos\\left(\\frac{\\omega}{M}\\right) + \\rho^{2}}$$\nSubstituting this back into the expression for $S_{y}\\!\\left(e^{j\\omega}\\right)$, we obtain the final analytical expression for the PSD of the decimated signal $y[n]$:\n$$S_{y}\\!\\left(e^{j\\omega}\\right) = \\frac{1}{M} \\frac{\\sigma_{w}^{2}}{1 - 2\\rho\\cos\\left(\\frac{\\omega}{M}\\right) + \\rho^{2}}$$\nThis expression is valid for $\\omega \\in (-\\pi, \\pi]$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{\\sigma_{w}^{2}}{M \\left(1 - 2\\rho\\cos\\left(\\frac{\\omega}{M}\\right) + \\rho^{2}\\right)}}$$", "id": "2863344"}]}
