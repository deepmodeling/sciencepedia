{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "Effective communication in engineering relies on precise and unambiguous language. In control theory, block diagrams serve as this language, and a robust notational syntax is essential for accurate modeling and analysis. This first practice focuses on the cornerstone of diagrammatic algebra—the summing junction—to ensure your representations are clear, consistent, and immune to layout-dependent errors [@problem_id:2690564].", "problem": "A single-input single-output Linear Time-Invariant (LTI) plant with transfer function $G(s)$ is driven by the algebraic sum of a commanded input $u(s)$ and an exogenous disturbance $d(s)$, so that the input to the plant is $v(s)$ and the output is $y(s)$ with $y(s)=G(s)\\,v(s)$ and $v(s)=u(s)+d(s)$. You wish to draw a block diagram and then perform block diagram algebra (series/parallel combinations, moving pick-off points, relocating summing junctions) without incurring sign errors. In particular, you want an annotation policy for the summing junction(s) and signal arrows that is invariant under such manipulations and makes the node equations unambiguous.\n\nStarting only from the definitions that a summing junction implements an algebraic sum of signed inputs and that a block implements a linear mapping of its input to its output, which of the following annotation policies correctly specifies signal directions and polarities at summing junctions so that algebraic reduction yields $y(s)=G(s)\\,[u(s)+d(s)]$ without sign ambiguity?\n\nA. Draw all inputs to a summing junction with arrowheads pointing into the node and the node’s output with an arrow pointing away. Place an explicit $+$ or $-$ label adjacent to each incoming line at the node, interpreted in the local node equation $v(s)=\\sum_i \\sigma_i x_i(s)$ with $\\sigma_i\\in\\{+1,-1\\}$, independent of where the line enters the circle. For the disturbance addition in $v(s)=u(s)+d(s)$, label both $u(s)$ and $d(s)$ with $+$ at the node. If a signal must be routed in the opposite geometric direction, keep the arrow consistent with the signal flow and, if needed, insert an explicit gain of $-1$ on the line rather than encoding sign in arrow direction.\n\nB. Omit all $+$ and $-$ labels. Interpret any line entering the summing junction from the left as positive, from the right as negative, from the top as positive, and from the bottom as negative; rely on this spatial convention to determine the algebraic signs.\n\nC. Do not place $+$ or $-$ labels on inputs. Use arrow direction to encode polarity: any line with an arrow pointing into the summing junction is treated as positive and any line with an arrow pointing away from the summing junction is treated as negative; the node output arrow may be either into or away from the node depending on convenience.\n\nD. Place a single $+$ sign inside the summing circle to indicate that the junction performs addition. If subtraction is needed, allow the later algebraic reduction to introduce negative signs into block gains rather than annotating the junction.\n\nE. Draw all inputs with arrows into the summing junction and place a $+$ on the output line to indicate a positive output sense. For any subtractive input, draw its arrow away from the junction; do not place a $-$ label at the node and avoid explicit $-1$ gains on lines.", "solution": "The problem requires the identification of a correct and unambiguous annotation policy for block diagrams, specifically for summing junctions, within the context of linear time-invariant (LTI) systems. A valid policy must ensure that the mathematical relationships are preserved and clearly represented, independent of the geometric layout of the diagram, and that the diagram remains consistent under standard block diagram algebraic manipulations. The system is defined by the equations $y(s)=G(s)\\,v(s)$ and $v(s)=u(s)+d(s)$.\n\nA block diagram is a graphical language for representing systems of equations. To be effective, its syntax must be unambiguous. The fundamental principles are:\n1.  Arrows on signal lines represent the direction of causality or signal flow. An arrow points from a source node or block output to a destination node or block input. This convention must be inviolable.\n2.  A summing junction represents an algebraic summation. Its output signal is a linear combination of its input signals.\n\nWe will now evaluate each proposed annotation policy against these principles and the criteria of unambiguity and invariance.\n\n**Option A Evaluation**\nThis policy states:\n- All inputs to a summing junction have arrows pointing into the node.\n- The output has an arrow pointing away from the node.\n- An explicit $+$ or $-$ label is placed adjacent to each input's arrowhead to denote its sign in the summation, $v(s)=\\sum_i \\sigma_i x_i(s)$ where $\\sigma_i \\in \\{+1, -1\\}$.\n- For geometric rerouting, signal flow direction (the arrow) is preserved, and sign inversion is accomplished with a gain block of $-1$, not by reversing the arrow.\n\nThis policy establishes a clear and orthogonal set of representations:\n- Signal flow (causality) is exclusively encoded by the arrow direction.\n- Algebraic sign is exclusively encoded by the $+$ or $-$ labels at the junction inputs.\n\nThis separation prevents any ambiguity. The meaning of the diagram is independent of the spatial arrangement of the lines. For the given equation $v(s)=u(s)+d(s)$, both the $u(s)$ and $d(s)$ signals would have arrows pointing into the junction, each accompanied by a $+$ sign. The resulting signal $v(s)$ would have an arrow pointing away. This correctly and uniquely represents the specified algebra. This policy is the standard convention used in control systems engineering precisely because it is robust, unambiguous, and invariant to diagrammatic transformations.\n\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\n**Option B Evaluation**\nThis policy states that signs are determined by the geometric direction from which a line enters the junction (left/top $= +$, right/bottom $= -$), with no explicit labels.\n\nThis policy is fatally flawed. Firstly, it is ambiguous. What is the sign of a line that enters at a $45^\\circ$ angle? The Cartesian reference (left/right, top/bottom) is arbitrary and ill-defined. Secondly, and more critically, it makes the mathematical meaning of the diagram dependent on its graphical layout. A simple redrawing of the diagram for aesthetic clarity could inadvertently change the signs of the inputs, thus altering the system equations the diagram is meant to represent. This violates the principle of invariance. For any serious engineering work, a notational system must be robust to such trivial changes in presentation.\n\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**Option C Evaluation**\nThis policy states that arrow direction encodes polarity: an arrow pointing into the junction is positive, and an arrow pointing away is negative. The output arrow's direction is supposedly flexible.\n\nThis policy is perhaps the most flawed, as it completely corrupts the fundamental meaning of arrows in a block diagram. The primary role of an arrow is to indicate the direction of signal flow. By co-opting this role to also represent algebraic sign, the policy creates irresolvable ambiguity. If an arrow pointing away from a junction represents a negative input, how does one distinguish it from the junction's actual output, which *must* flow away from the junction? The statement that \"the output arrow may be either into or away from the node\" is nonsensical and violates the principle of causality. A node's output cannot flow into itself. This policy fails to provide a consistent way to distinguish inputs from outputs, and thus cannot form a coherent graphical language.\n\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**Option D Evaluation**\nThis policy suggests placing a single $+$ inside the summing circle to indicate addition and avoiding junction annotations for subtraction, instead relying on explicit gain blocks of $-1$ upstream.\n\nWhile it is true that any subtraction $a-b$ can be written as an addition $a+(-b)$, and one can always insert a block of gain $-1$ to generate $-b$ from $b$, this policy is incomplete and restrictive as a general rule. It fails to define how to annotate a junction that performs both addition and subtraction, for example, $w(s) = x(s) + y(s) - z(s)$. The standard policy (A) handles this with ease by labeling the inputs $x(s)$ and $y(s)$ with $+$ and $z(s)$ with $-$. Policy (D) forces the diagram to be cluttered with additional gain blocks of $-1$ for every subtraction, which is inefficient. A robust notational system should provide a direct way to represent common operations like subtraction at the junction itself. Thus, this policy is an impoverished subset of the superior policy described in (A).\n\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**Option E Evaluation**\nThis policy states that subtractive inputs are indicated by drawing their arrows *away* from the junction, while additive inputs have arrows pointing in.\n\nThis policy suffers from the same fundamental defect as option C: it conflates algebraic sign with the direction of signal flow. An arrow pointing away from a junction must, by convention, represent an output signal. Using it to represent a negative input makes it impossible to distinguish a negative input from an output. In an equation like $v(s) = u(s) - d(s)$, the signals $u(s)$ and $d(s)$ are both causal inputs to the mathematical operation of subtraction that produces $v(s)$. The graphical representation must reflect this. Having the arrow for $d(s)$ point away from the junction incorrectly depicts $d(s)$ as an effect or output of the junction, when it is in fact a cause or input. This leads to logical and graphical inconsistency.\n\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\nIn summary, only Option A provides a logically sound, unambiguous, and robust framework for annotating block diagrams that is consistent with the established principles of control theory. It correctly separates the representation of signal causality (arrows) from algebraic operations (signs).", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2690564"}, {"introduction": "The canonical negative feedback loop is arguably the most important structure in all of control theory.

I will now proceed with the solution.\n\nThe analysis will be conducted in two parts as required: first using Mason's Gain Formula, and second using algebraic block-diagram reduction.\n\n**Method 1: Mason’s Gain Formula (MGF)**\n\nMason's Gain Formula is given by $T(s) = \\frac{1}{\\Delta(s)} \\sum_{k} P_k(s) \\Delta_k(s)$, where $P_k$ are the forward path gains, $\\Delta$ is the graph determinant, and $\\Delta_k$ are the path cofactors.\n\n1.  **Forward Paths ($P_k$)**: A forward path is a path from the input node $n_0$ to the output node $n_5$ that does not traverse any node more than once.\n    -   Path 1 ($P_1$): Through the upper branch, $n_0 \\rightarrow n_1 \\rightarrow n_2 \\rightarrow n_5$. The path gain is the product of the branch gains: $P_1(s) = G_1(s) G_2(s) \\cdot 1 = G_1(s)G_2(s)$.\n    -   Path 2 ($P_2$): Through the lower branch, $n_0 \\rightarrow n_3 \\rightarrow n_4 \\rightarrow n_5$. The path gain is: $P_2(s) = G_3(s) G_4(s) \\cdot 1 = G_3(s)G_4(s)$.\n    There are two forward paths.\n\n2.  **Individual Loops ($L_i$)**: A loop is a path that starts and ends at the same node.\n    -   Loop 1 ($L_1$): The feedback loop in the upper branch, $n_1 \\rightarrow n_2 \\rightarrow n_1$. The gain of this loop is $L_1(s) = G_2(s) \\cdot (-H_1(s)) = -G_2(s)H_1(s)$. The negative sign comes from the specified negative feedback.\n    -   Loop 2 ($L_2$): The feedback loop in the lower branch, $n_3 \\rightarrow n_4 \\rightarrow n_3$. The gain of this loop is $L_2(s) = G_4(s) \\cdot (-H_2(s)) = -G_4(s)H_2(s)$.\n    There are two loops. As stated in the problem, these loops are non-touching because they do not share any nodes. Loop $L_1$ involves nodes $\\{n_1, n_2\\}$ and loop $L_2$ involves nodes $\\{n_3, n_4\\}$.\n\n3.  **Graph Determinant ($\\Delta$)**: The determinant is calculated as $\\Delta = 1 - (\\sum L_i) + (\\sum L_i L_j) - \\dots$.\n    -   Sum of individual loop gains: $\\sum L_i = L_1(s) + L_2(s) = -G_2(s)H_1(s) - G_4(s)H_2(s)$.\n    -   Sum of gain products of non-touching loop pairs: There is only one pair of non-touching loops, ($L_1, L_2$). The product is $L_1(s)L_2(s) = (-G_2(s)H_1(s))(-G_4(s)H_2(s)) = G_2(s)H_1(s)G_4(s)H_2(s)$.\n    -   Therefore, the determinant is:\n        $$ \\Delta(s) = 1 - (L_1(s) + L_2(s)) + (L_1(s)L_2(s)) $$\n        $$ \\Delta(s) = 1 - (-G_2(s)H_1(s) - G_4(s)H_2(s)) + G_2(s)H_1(s)G_4(s)H_2(s) $$\n        $$ \\Delta(s) = 1 + G_2(s)H_1(s) + G_4(s)H_2(s) + G_2(s)H_1(s)G_4(s)H_2(s) $$\n        This can be factored as $\\Delta(s) = (1 + G_2(s)H_1(s))(1 + G_4(s)H_2(s))$.\n\n4.  **Path Cofactors ($\\Delta_k$)**: $\\Delta_k$ is the determinant of the subgraph formed by removing all loops that touch the $k$-th forward path.\n    -   For path $P_1$ (nodes $n_0, n_1, n_2, n_5$): This path touches loop $L_1$ (at nodes $n_1, n_2$) but does not touch loop $L_2$. Therefore, $\\Delta_1$ is calculated with only loop $L_2$.\n        $$ \\Delta_1(s) = 1 - L_2(s) = 1 - (-G_4(s)H_2(s)) = 1 + G_4(s)H_2(s) $$\n    -   For path $P_2$ (nodes $n_0, n_3, n_4, n_5$): This path touches loop $L_2$ (at nodes $n_3, n_4$) but does not touch loop $L_1$. Therefore, $\\Delta_2$ is calculated with only loop $L_1$.\n        $$ \\Delta_2(s) = 1 - L_1(s) = 1 - (-G_2(s)H_1(s)) = 1 + G_2(s)H_1(s) $$\n\n5.  **Total Transfer Function ($T(s)$)**:\n    $$ T(s) = \\frac{P_1(s)\\Delta_1(s) + P_2(s)\\Delta_2(s)}{\\Delta(s)} $$\n    $$ T(s) = \\frac{G_1(s)G_2(s)(1 + G_4(s)H_2(s)) + G_3(s)G_4(s)(1 + G_2(s)H_1(s))}{(1 + G_2(s)H_1(s))(1 + G_4(s)H_2(s))} $$\n\n**Method 2: Block-Diagram Reduction**\n\nThe system structure consists of two independent branches connected in parallel. The input $R(s)$ is fed to both branches, and their outputs are summed at node $n_5$ to produce $Y(s)$. By the principle of superposition, the overall transfer function $T(s)$ is the sum of the transfer functions of the two parallel branches, $T_1(s)$ and $T_2(s)$.\n$$ T(s) = T_1(s) + T_2(s) $$\n\n1.  **Transfer Function of Branch 1 ($T_1(s)$)**:\n    This branch has a block $G_1(s)$ in series with a feedback structure. The feedback loop involves the forward transfer function $G_2(s)$ and the feedback transfer function $H_1(s)$. The standard formula for a negative feedback loop is $\\frac{G}{1+GH}$.\n    -   The transfer function of the feedback portion (from node $n_1$ to node $n_2$) is $\\frac{G_2(s)}{1+G_2(s)H_1(s)}$.\n    -   This feedback system is in series with the preceding block $G_1(s)$. The transfer function of series components is their product.\n    -   Therefore, the transfer function of the entire upper branch is:\n        $$ T_1(s) = G_1(s) \\cdot \\frac{G_2(s)}{1 + G_2(s)H_1(s)} = \\frac{G_1(s)G_2(s)}{1 + G_2(s)H_1(s)} $$\n\n2.  **Transfer Function of Branch 2 ($T_2(s)$)**:\n    This branch is structurally identical to the first. By analogy, we replace $G_1, G_2, H_1$ with $G_3, G_4, H_2$.\n    -   The transfer function of the feedback portion is $\\frac{G_4(s)}{1+G_4(s)H_2(s)}$.\n    -   This is in series with $G_3(s)$.\n    -   Therefore, the transfer function of the entire lower branch is:\n        $$ T_2(s) = G_3(s) \\cdot \\frac{G_4(s)}{1 + G_4(s)H_2(s)} = \\frac{G_3(s)G_4(s)}{1 + G_4(s)H_2(s)} $$\n\n3.  **Total Transfer Function ($T(s)$)**:\n    Summing the transfer functions of the two parallel branches gives:\n    $$ T(s) = T_1(s) + T_2(s) = \\frac{G_1(s)G_2(s)}{1 + G_2(s)H_1(s)} + \\frac{G_3(s)G_4(s)}{1 + G_4(s)H_2(s)} $$\n    To verify this against the MGF result, we can place this expression over a common denominator:\n    $$ T(s) = \\frac{G_1(s)G_2(s)(1 + G_4(s)H_2(s))}{(1 + G_2(s)H_1(s))(1 + G_4(s)H_2(s))} + \\frac{G_3(s)G_4(s)(1 + G_2(s)H_1(s))}{(1 + G_2(s)H_1(s))(1 + G_4(s)H_2(s))} $$\n    $$ T(s) = \\frac{G_1(s)G_2(s)(1 + G_4(s)H_2(s)) + G_3(s)G_4(s)(1 + G_2(s)H_1(s))}{(1 + G_2(s)H_1(s))(1 + G_4(s)H_2(s))} $$\nThis expression is identical to the one derived using Mason's Gain Formula. The independent verification is successful. The structure of the final expression confirms that the total system response is the sum of the responses of two independent, parallel subsystems.", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{\\frac{G_{1}(s)G_{2}(s)(1 + G_{4}(s)H_{2}(s)) + G_{3}(s)G_{4}(s)(1 + G_{2}(s)H_{1}(s))}{(1 + G_{2}(s)H_{1}(s))(1 + G_{4}(s)H_{2}(s))}} $$", "id": "2690600"}]}
