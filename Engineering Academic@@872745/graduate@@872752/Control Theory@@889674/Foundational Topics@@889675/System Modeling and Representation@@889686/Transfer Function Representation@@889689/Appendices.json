We will proceed with the solution.\n\nThe problem is divided into two parts. First, a general derivation concerning the inverse Laplace transform of a function with a higher-order pole. Second, a specific calculation of a system's step response.\n\nPart 1: Derivation of the Time-Domain Contribution of a Pole\n\nWe begin with the Bromwich inversion integral for a function $F(s)$, which defines the inverse Laplace transform $\\mathcal{L}^{-1}\\{F(s)\\}(t) = f(t)$:\n$$ f(t) = \\frac{1}{2\\pi i}\\int_{\\gamma-i\\infty}^{\\gamma+i\\infty} F(s)\\exp(s t)\\,ds, \\quad t0 $$\nwhere the path of integration is a vertical line in the complex plane to the right of all singularities of $F(s)$.

Cauchy's Residue Theorem then states that the integral is equal to $2\\pi i$ times the sum of the residues of the integrand $F(s)\\exp(s t)$ at all poles enclosed by the contour.\n$$ f(t) = \\sum_{j} \\text{Res}\\left( F(s)\\exp(s t), s_j \\right) $$\nwhere $s_j$ are the poles of $F(s)$.\n\nThe problem asks for the time-domain contribution associated with a pole of order $k \\ge 1$ at $s=p$. Specifically, it asks to show how a singular term proportional to $(s-p)^{-k}$ in $F(s)$ generates a time-domain term. Let us consider the specific term in the partial fraction expansion of $F(s)$ corresponding to the highest-order singularity at $s=p$. This term can be written as $A(s-p)^{-k}$ for some constant $A$. We seek the inverse Laplace transform of this term, which is given by the residue of $A(s-p)^{-k}\\exp(s t)$ at the pole $s=p$.\n\nThe pole at $s=p$ is of order $k$. The residue of a function $\\phi(s)$ at a pole $s_0$ of order $m$ is given by the formula:\n$$ \\text{Res}(\\phi(s), s_0) = \\frac{1}{(m-1)!} \\lim_{s\\to s_0} \\frac{d^{m-1}}{ds^{m-1}}\\left[ (s-s_0)^m \\phi(s) \\right] $$\nIn our case, $\\phi(s) = A(s-p)^{-k}\\exp(s t)$ and the pole is $s_0=p$ of order $m=k$. Applying the formula:\n$$ \\text{Res}\\left( \\frac{A}{(s-p)^k}\\exp(s t), p \\right) = \\frac{1}{(k-1)!} \\lim_{s\\to p} \\frac{d^{k-1}}{ds^{k-1}}\\left[ (s-p)^k \\frac{A}{(s-p)^k}\\exp(s t) \\right] $$\n$$ = \\frac{1}{(k-1)!} \\lim_{s\\to p} \\frac{d^{k-1}}{ds^{k-1}}\\left[ A\\exp(s t) \\right] $$\nWe must compute the $(k-1)$-th derivative of $A\\exp(s t)$ with respect to $s$. The variable of differentiation is $s$, so $t$ is treated as a constant.\n$$ \\frac{d}{ds} \\exp(s t) = t\\exp(s t) $$\n$$ \\frac{d^2}{ds^2} \\exp(s t) = t^2\\exp(s t) $$\nBy induction, the $n$-th derivative is:\n$$ \\frac{d^n}{ds^n} \\exp(s t) = t^n\\exp(s t) $$\nFor $n=k-1$, we have:\n$$ \\frac{d^{k-1}}{ds^{k-1}}\\left[ A\\exp(s t) \\right] = A t^{k-1}\\exp(s t) $$\nTaking the limit as $s \\to p$ is trivial, as the expression is continuous in $s$:\n$$ \\lim_{s\\to p} \\left[ A t^{k-1}\\exp(s t) \\right] = A t^{k-1}\\exp(p t) $$\nSubstituting this back into the residue expression gives the time-domain contribution:\n$$ \\text{Contribution} = \\frac{A}{(k-1)!} t^{k-1}\\exp(p t) $$\nThis demonstrates that a singular term $A(s-p)^{-k}$ in the $s$-domain produces a time-domain term proportional to $t^{k-1}\\exp(p t)$. The exact proportionality constant is $A/((k-1)!)$. This derivation uses only the residue theorem and differentiation, as required. The use of the Taylor series of the exponential function provides an alternative, equivalent path. Expanding $\\exp(st)$ around $s=p$:\n$$ \\exp(st) = \\exp(pt)\\exp((s-p)t) = \\exp(pt) \\sum_{j=0}^\\infty \\frac{((s-p)t)^j}{j!} $$\nThe integrand is $\\frac{A}{(s-p)^k} \\exp(st)$. The residue is the coefficient of the $(s-p)^{-1}$ term in its Laurent series.\n$$ \\frac{A}{(s-p)^k} \\exp(pt) \\left( 1 + (s-p)t + \\dots + \\frac{t^{k-1}}{(k-1)!}(s-p)^{k-1} + \\dots \\right) $$\nThe term with $(s-p)^{-1}$ is obtained by multiplying $\\frac{A}{(s-p)^k}$ with the term containing $(s-p)^{k-1}$ from the series expansion:\n$$ \\frac{A}{(s-p)^k} \\cdot \\exp(pt) \\cdot \\frac{t^{k-1}}{(k-1)!}(s-p)^{k-1} = \\left( A \\frac{t^{k-1}}{(k-1)!} \\exp(pt) \\right) \\frac{1}{s-p} $$\nThe coefficient, which is the residue, is $A \\frac{t^{k-1}}{(k-1)!} \\exp(pt)$, confirming the result.\n\nPart 2: Calculation of the Unit-Step Response\n\nWe are given the transfer function $G(s) = \\frac{6}{(s+1)^3}$ and a unit-step input $R(s) = \\frac{1}{s}$.

A system is defined as BIBO stable if and only if every bounded input produces a bounded output. For an LTI system, a necessary and sufficient condition for BIBO stability is that its impulse response $g(t)$ is absolutely integrable, i.e., $\\int_{0}^{\\infty} |g(t)| dt  \\infty$. This condition, in the Laplace domain, is equivalent to all poles of the transfer function $G(s)$ having strictly negative real parts (i.e., they must lie in the open left-half of the complex s-plane).\n\nThe transfer function of the given system is $G(s) = \\frac{s+2}{s(s+1)(s+3)}$. The poles are the roots of the denominator, which are $s_1=0$, $s_2=-1$, and $s_3=-3$. The pole at $s_1=0$ does not have a strictly negative real part; it lies on the imaginary axis. Therefore, the system is not BIBO stable. This type of pole is an ideal integrator.\n\nTo see this from the definition of the impulse response, we first find $g(t) = \\mathcal{L}^{-1}\\{G(s)\\}$. The partial fraction expansion of $G(s)$ is:\n$$\nG(s) = \\frac{K_1}{s} + \\frac{K_2}{s+1} + \\frac{K_3}{s+3}\n$$\nwhere\n$K_1 = [sG(s)]_{s=0} = \\frac{2}{3}$,\n$K_2 = [(s+1)G(s)]_{s=-1} = \\frac{1}{(-1)(2)} = -\\frac{1}{2}$,\n$K_3 = [(s+3)G(s)]_{s=-3} = \\frac{-1}{(-3)(-2)} = -\\frac{1}{6}$.\nThe impulse response for $t \\ge 0$ is:\n$$\ng(t) = \\frac{2}{3} - \\frac{1}{2}\\exp(-t) - \\frac{1}{6}\\exp(-3t)\n$$\nThe absolute integrability condition is violated because as $t \\to \\infty$, $g(t)$ approaches a constant value of $\\frac{2}{3}$. The integral $\\int_{0}^{\\infty} |g(t)| dt$ diverges, confirming the system is not BIBO stable.\n\nThe failure of BIBO stability is evident in the step response $y(t)$ we derived:\n$$\ny(t) = \\frac{2}{3}t - \\frac{5}{9} + \\frac{1}{2}\\exp(-t) + \\frac{1}{18}\\exp(-3t)\n$$\nThe input $u(t)$ is bounded, as $|u(t)|=1$ for $t \\ge 0$. However, the output $y(t)$ is unbounded. As $t \\to \\infty$, the exponential terms decay to zero, but the term $\\frac{2}{3}t$ grows linearly without bound. This term is precisely what causes the output to be unbounded.\n\nThis unbounded behavior occurs because the system contains an integrator (the pole at $s=0$), and the input contains a non-zero direct-current (DC) component. The step input has a DC value of $1$. The integrator in the system, represented by the term $\\frac{K_1}{s} = \\frac{2/3}{s}$ in the expansion of $G(s)$, integrates this DC component of the input. In the Laplace domain, the interaction between the integrator and the step input (DC component) manifests as a product of terms $\\frac{1}{s} \\cdot \\frac{1}{s} = \\frac{1}{s^2}$. The inverse Laplace transform of this is a ramp function, $t$. The term $\\frac{2}{3}t$ in the output is the direct result of the system's integrator with gain $\\frac{2}{3}$ acting on the unit step input. Any bounded input with a non-zero DC component will similarly cause a ramp-like, unbounded output from an ideal integrator, thus violating BIBO stability.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{y(t) = \\frac{2}{3}t - \\frac{5}{9} + \\frac{1}{2}\\exp(-t) + \\frac{1}{18}\\exp(-3t)}\n$$", "id": "2755941"}]}
