All premises are scientifically sound, the data provided is complete and consistent, and the question is well-posed. We shall proceed with the solution.\n\nThe system is given in state-space form, $\\dot{x}(t) = A\\,x(t) + B\\,u(t)$, where the state vector $x(t) \\in \\mathbb{R}^4$ is expressed in a basis of eigenvectors of the matrix $A$. The provided system matrices are:\n$$ A = \\mathrm{diag}(-3, -1, 2, 4) $$\n$$ B = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ -1 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix} $$\nThe eigenvalues of $A$ are the diagonal entries: $\\lambda_1 = -3$, $\\lambda_2 = -1$, $\\lambda_3 = 2$, and $\\lambda_4 = 4$. Since $A$ is diagonal, the standard basis vectors $e_1, e_2, e_3, e_4$ are the eigenvectors corresponding to these eigenvalues, respectively.\n\nThe state equations can be written as a set of decoupled first-order differential equations for each component of the state vector $x(t) = \\begin{pmatrix} x_1(t)  x_2(t)  x_3(t)  x_4(t) \\end{pmatrix}^T$:\n$$ \\dot{x}_1(t) = -3 x_1(t) + 1 \\cdot u(t) $$\n$$ \\dot{x}_2(t) = -1 x_2(t) - 1 \\cdot u(t) $$\n$$ \\dot{x}_3(t) = 2 x_3(t) + 0 \\cdot u(t) $$\n$$ \\dotx_4(t) = 4 x_4(t) + 0 \\cdot u(t) $$\nA state variable, or mode, is controllable if the control input $u(t)$ can influence its dynamics. From the equations above, it is immediately apparent that the dynamics of $x_3(t)$ and $x_4(t)$ are entirely independent of the control input $u(t)$. The solutions to these are $x_3(t) = x_3(0) \\exp(2t)$ and $x_4(t) = x_4(0) \\exp(4t)$. If the initial conditions $x_3(0)$ or $x_4(0)$ are non-zero, there is no control input $u(t)$ that can drive these states to the origin. Therefore, the system cannot be steered to an arbitrary final state, and it is by definition uncontrollable. The uncontrollable modes correspond to the states $x_3$ and $x_4$, which are associated with the eigenspaces of eigenvalues $\\lambda_3=2$ and $\\lambda_4=4$. This is a direct consequence of the third and fourth rows of the input matrix $B$ being zero in this eigenbasis representation.\n\nTo provide a more formal justification using a core definition, we can utilize the Popov-Belevitch-Hautus (PBH) test. The PBH test states that the pair $(A, B)$ is controllable if and only if the matrix $[\\lambda I - A \\quad B]$ has full row rank ($n=4$) for every eigenvalue $\\lambda$ of $A$. Let us test this condition for the eigenvalue $\\lambda_3 = 2$:\n$$ [\\lambda_3 I - A \\quad B] = [2I - A \\quad B] = \\left[ \\begin{pmatrix} 2  0  0  0 \\\\ 0  2  0  0 \\\\ 0  0  2  0 \\\\ 0  0  0  2 \\end{pmatrix} - \\begin{pmatrix} -3  0  0  0 \\\\ 0  -1  0  0 \\\\ 0  0  2  0 \\\\ 0  0  0  4 \\end{pmatrix} \\quad \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ -1 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\right] $$\n$$ = \\left[ \\begin{pmatrix} 5  0  0  0 \\\\ 0  3  0  0 \\\\ 0  0  0  0 \\\\ 0  0  0  -2 \\end{pmatrix} \\quad \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ -1 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\right] = \\begin{pmatrix} 5  0  0  0  1 \\\\ 0  3  0  0  -1 \\\\ 0  0  0  0  0 \\\\ 0  0  0  -2  0 \\end{pmatrix} $$\nThe third row of this matrix is entirely zero. Consequently, its rank is less than $4$. The condition for controllability fails. A similar result is obtained for $\\lambda_4 = 4$. This confirms that the system is uncontrollable.\n\nThe problem then requires the computation of the rank of the Kalman controllability matrix $\\mathcal{C} = [B \\quad AB \\quad A^2B \\quad A^3B]$. We will construct this matrix column by column.\nThe first column is $B$:\n$$ B = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ -1 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix} $$\nThe second column is $AB$:\n$$ AB = \\begin{pmatrix} -3  0  0  0 \\\\ 0  -1  0  0 \\\\ 0  0  2  0 \\\\ 0  0  0  4 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ -1 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} -3 \\\\ 1 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix} $$\nThe third column is $A^2B = A(AB)$:\n$$ A^2B = \\begin{pmatrix} -3  0  0  0 \\\\ 0  -1  0  0 \\\\ 0  0  2  0 \\\\ 0  0  0  4 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} -3 \\\\ 1 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 9 \\\\ -1 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix} $$\nThe fourth column is $A^3B = A(A^2B)$:\n$$ A^3B = \\begin{pmatrix} -3  0  0  0 \\\\ 0  -1  0  0 \\\\ 0  0  2  0 \\\\ 0  0  0  4 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} 9 \\\\ -1 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} -27 \\\\ 1 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix} $$\nNow, assemble the controllability matrix $\\mathcal{C}$:\n$$ \\mathcal{C} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1  -3  9  -27 \\\\ -1  1  -1  1 \\\\ 0  0  0  0 \\\\ 0  0  0  0 \\end{pmatrix} $$\nTo find the rank of $\\mathcal{C}$, we determine the number of linearly independent columns (or rows). The third and fourth rows are zero vectors, which means the rank of $\\mathcal{C}$ is at most $2$. We inspect the first two columns, $v_1 = \\begin{pmatrix} 1  -1  0  0 \\end{pmatrix}^T$ and $v_2 = \\begin{pmatrix} -3  1  0  0 \\end{pmatrix}^T$. These two vectors are not scalar multiples of each other, and thus are linearly independent. For example, the determinant of the submatrix formed by their non-zero components is $1(1) - (-3)(-1) = 1 - 3 = -2 \\neq 0$.\nSince there are at least two linearly independent columns and the rank cannot exceed $2$, the rank of the controllability matrix $\\mathcal{C}$ is exactly $2$. This is consistent with our earlier finding that the system has two controllable modes and two uncontrollable modes. The rank of the controllability matrix is equal to the dimension of the controllable subspace, which in this case is $2$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{2}$$", "id": "2700306"}, {"introduction": "The dual concept to controllability is observability—the ability to deduce the internal state of a system from its outputs.
