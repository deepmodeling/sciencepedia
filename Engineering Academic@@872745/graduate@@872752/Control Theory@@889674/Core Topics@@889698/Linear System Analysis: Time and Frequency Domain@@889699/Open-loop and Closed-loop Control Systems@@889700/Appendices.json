It is a well-posed, scientifically grounded problem in classical control theory. All necessary data are provided, and there are no internal contradictions or ambiguities. I shall proceed to solve it.\n\nThe system is a unity negative-feedback loop with plant $P(s) = \\frac{1}{s(s+2)}$ and controller $C(s) = k$. The open-loop transfer function is $L(s) = C(s)P(s) = \\frac{k}{s(s+2)}$. The closed-loop poles are the roots of the characteristic equation, which is given by $1 + L(s) = 0$.\nSubstituting the expression for $L(s)$, we obtain:\n$$1 + \\frac{k}{s(s+2)} = 0$$\nThis can be rewritten as:\n$$s(s+2) + k = 0$$\n$$s^2 + 2s + k = 0$$\nThe root locus is the set of all complex numbers $s$ that satisfy this equation for some real, non-negative gain $k \\ge 0$. To derive the locus from first principles, we rearrange the equation to express $k$ as a function of $s$:\n$$k(s) = -s(s+2)$$\nFor a point $s$ to be on the root locus, the value $k(s)$ it produces must be a real, non-negative number. Let $s = \\sigma + j\\omega$, where $\\sigma$ is the real part and $\\omega$ is the imaginary part of $s$. We substitute this into the expression for $k$:\n$$k(\\sigma + j\\omega) = -(\\sigma + j\\omega)(\\sigma + j\\omega + 2)$$\n$$k = -[(\\sigma(\\sigma+2) - \\omega^2) + j(\\omega(\\sigma+2) + \\sigma\\omega)]$$\n$$k = -(\\sigma^2 + 2\\sigma - \\omega^2) - j(2\\sigma\\omega + 2\\omega)$$\n$$k = -(\\sigma^2 + 2\\sigma - \\omega^2) - j(2\\omega(\\sigma+1))$$\nFor $k$ to be a real number, its imaginary part must be zero:\n$$\\text{Im}\\{k\\} = -2\\omega(\\sigma+1) = 0$$\nThis condition is satisfied if and only if $\\omega=0$ or $\\sigma=-1$. These two conditions define all possible locations for the root locus in the complex plane.\n\nFurthermore, for $s$ to be on the root locus for $k \\ge 0$, the real value of $k$ must be non-negative:\n$$\\text{Re}\\{k\\} = -(\\sigma^2 + 2\\sigma - \\omega^2) \\ge 0$$\nThis is equivalent to the condition:\n$$\\sigma^2 + 2\\sigma - \\omega^2 \\le 0$$\nWe now analyze the two branches derived from the imaginary part condition.\n\nCase 1: $\\omega=0$ (The locus is on the real axis)\nIf $\\omega=0$, the non-negativity condition for $k$ simplifies to:\n$$\\sigma^2 + 2\\sigma \\le 0$$\n$$\\sigma(\\sigma+2) \\le 0$$\nThis inequality holds for $\\sigma$ in the closed interval $[-2, 0]$. Thus, the segment of the real axis between $s=-2$ and $s=0$ is part of the root locus. These points correspond to the open-loop poles of the system, which are the closed-loop poles when $k=0$.\n\nCase 2: $\\sigma=-1$ (The locus is on a vertical line)\nIf $\\sigma=-1$, the non-negativity condition for $k$ becomes:\n$$(-1)^2 + 2(-1) - \\omega^2 \\le 0$$\n$$1 - 2 - \\omega^2 \\le 0$$\n$$-1 - \\omega^2 \\le 0$$\nThis inequality is satisfied for all real values of $\\omega$. Therefore, the entire vertical line defined by $\\text{Re}(s) = -1$ is part of the root locus.\n\nSummary of the root locus geometry:\nThe root locus consists of two parts: the real-axis segment $[-2, 0]$ and the vertical line $\\text{Re}(s) = -1$.\nFor $k=0$, the poles are at $s=-2$ and $s=0$. As $k$ increases, the poles move along the real axis toward each other. They meet at the point where the two branches intersect, which is $s=-1$. To find the value of $k$ at this breakaway point, we substitute $s=-1$ into the equation for $k$:\n$$k = -(-1)(-1+2) = -(-1)(1) = 1$$\nFor $k  1$, the poles become a complex-conjugate pair and move away from the real axis along the line $\\text{Re}(s)=-1$. As $k \\to \\infty$, the poles $s = -1 \\pm j\\sqrt{k-1}$ move towards infinity along this vertical line, so $|s| \\to \\infty$. This describes the limiting behavior.\n\nNow, we determine the gain $k$ that yields a damping ratio of $\\zeta = 0.5$.\nThe standard characteristic equation for a second-order system is:\n$$s^2 + 2\\zeta\\omega_n s + \\omega_n^2 = 0$$\nwhere $\\zeta$ is the damping ratio and $\\omega_n$ is the natural frequency.\nOur system's characteristic equation is:\n$$s^2 + 2s + k = 0$$\nBy comparing the coefficients of the two equations, we establish the following identities:\n$$2\\zeta\\omega_n = 2 \\implies \\zeta\\omega_n = 1$$\n$$\\omega_n^2 = k$$\nWe are given the condition that the damping ratio is $\\zeta = 0.5$. Substituting this value into the first identity:\n$$0.5 \\cdot \\omega_n = 1 \\implies \\omega_n = \\frac{1}{0.5} = 2$$\nNow, using the second identity, we can find the required gain $k$:\n$$k = \\omega_n^2 = 2^2 = 4$$\nFor this gain, the system is underdamped, which is consistent with the complex poles found on the root locus for $k  1$.

It is therefore deemed valid. We shall proceed with the analysis.\n\nThe problem requires a two-part analysis: first, an assessment of the internal stability of a unity-feedback control system, and second, the computation of a specific time-domain response.\n\nFirst, we address the question of internal stability. The analysis must be based on first principles, starting from the defining algebraic equations of the feedback loop. The system is described by the following equations in the Laplace domain, assuming zero initial conditions:\n$$\nY(s) = P(s)[U(s) + D(s)]\n$$\n$$\nU(s) = C(s)E(s)\n$$\n$$\nE(s) = R(s) - Y(s)\n$$\nHere, $Y(s)$ is the plant output, $U(s)$ is the control signal, $E(s)$ is the error signal, $R(s)$ is the reference input, and $D(s)$ is the disturbance input. The plant and controller transfer functions are given as $P(s) = \\frac{1}{s-2}$ and $C(s) = \\frac{s-2}{s+4}$.\n\nInternal stability requires that every transfer function from any exogenous input ($R(s)$, $D(s)$) to any internal signal ($Y(s)$, $E(s)$, $U(s)$) be stable. That is, all poles of these transfer functions must lie in the open left-half of the complex plane.\n\nWe derive the transfer functions for the internal signals $Y(s)$ and $U(s)$ in terms of the external inputs $R(s)$ and $D(s)$. First, we solve for the output $Y(s)$ by substituting the expressions for $U(s)$ and $E(s)$:\n$$\nY(s) = P(s)[C(s)(R(s) - Y(s)) + D(s)]\n$$\n$$\nY(s) = P(s)C(s)R(s) - P(s)C(s)Y(s) + P(s)D(s)\n$$\nCollecting terms with $Y(s)$:\n$$\nY(s)(1 + P(s)C(s)) = P(s)C(s)R(s) + P(s)D(s)\n$$\nThus, the output is:\n$$\nY(s) = \\frac{P(s)C(s)}{1 + P(s)C(s)} R(s) + \\frac{P(s)}{1 + P(s)C(s)} D(s)\n$$\nNext, we solve for the control signal $U(s)$. We start from $U(s) = C(s)E(s) = C(s)(R(s) - Y(s))$ and substitute the expression for $Y(s)$:\n$$\nU(s) = C(s) \\left( R(s) - \\left[ \\frac{P(s)C(s)}{1 + P(s)C(s)} R(s) + \\frac{P(s)}{1 + P(s)C(s)} D(s) \\right] \\right)\n$$\n$$\nU(s) = C(s) \\left( \\frac{1 + P(s)C(s) - P(s)C(s)}{1 + P(s)C(s)} R(s) - \\frac{P(s)}{1 + P(s)C(s)} D(s) \\right)\n$$\n$$\nU(s) = \\frac{C(s)}{1 + P(s)C(s)} R(s) - \\frac{P(s)C(s)}{1 + P(s)C(s)} D(s)\n$$\nNow we compute the term $1 + P(s)C(s)$.

From reference $R(s)$ to output $Y(s)$:\n    $$T_{YR}(s) = \\frac{P(s)C(s)}{1 + P(s)C(s)} = \\frac{1/(s+4)}{(s+5)/(s+4)} = \\frac{1}{s+5}$$\n    This transfer function is stable, with a pole at $s=-5$.\n\n2.  From disturbance $D(s)$ to output $Y(s)$:\n    $$T_{YD}(s) = \\frac{P(s)}{1 + P(s)C(s)} = \\frac{1/(s-2)}{(s+5)/(s+4)} = \\frac{s+4}{(s-2)(s+5)}$$\n    This transfer function is **unstable** due to the pole at $s=2$, which originates from the unstable plant pole that was cancelled in the loop gain calculation.\n\n3.  From reference $R(s)$ to control $U(s)$:\n    $$T_{UR}(s) = \\frac{C(s)}{1 + P(s)C(s)} = \\frac{(s-2)/(s+4)}{(s+5)/(s+4)} = \\frac{s-2}{s+5}$$\n    This transfer function is stable, with a pole at $s=-5$.\n\n4.  From disturbance $D(s)$ to control $U(s)$:\n    $$T_{UD}(s) = -\\frac{P(s)C(s)}{1 + P(s)C(s)} = -\\frac{1/(s+4)}{(s+5)/(s+4)} = -\\frac{1}{s+5}$$\n    This transfer function is stable, with a pole at $s=-5$.\n\nSince the transfer function $T_{YD}(s)$ possesses a pole in the right-half plane (at $s=2$), the system is **not internally stable**. A bounded disturbance $d(t)$ can lead to an unbounded output $y(t)$. The unstable pole of the plant $P(s)$ is unobservable from the reference input $r(t)$ but is observable from the disturbance input $d(t)$.\n\nFor the second part of the problem, we must compute the time-domain expression for the plant state $x_p(t)$, which is given to be equal to the plant output $y(t)$. The conditions are $r(t) = 0$ (so $R(s)=0$) and $d(t) = \\exp(-t)$ for $t \\ge 0$. The Laplace transform of the disturbance is $D(s) = \\mathcal{L}\\{\\exp(-t)\\} = \\frac{1}{s+1}$.\n\nSince $R(s)=0$, the output $Y(s)$ is given by:\n$$\nY(s) = T_{YD}(s) D(s) = \\left( \\frac{s+4}{(s-2)(s+5)} \\right) \\left( \\frac{1}{s+1} \\right) = \\frac{s+4}{(s-2)(s+1)(s+5)}\n$$\nTo find the inverse Laplace transform $y(t)$, we perform a partial fraction expansion of $Y(s)$:\n$$\nY(s) = \\frac{A}{s-2} + \\frac{B}{s+1} + \\frac{C}{s+5}\n$$\nWe compute the residues $A$, $B$, and $C$:\n$$\nA = \\lim_{s \\to 2} (s-2)Y(s) = \\left. \\frac{s+4}{(s+1)(s+5)} \\right|_{s=2} = \\frac{2+4}{(2+1)(2+5)} = \\frac{6}{3 \\cdot 7} = \\frac{2}{7}\n$$\n$$\nB = \\lim_{s \\to -1} (s+1)Y(s) = \\left. \\frac{s+4}{(s-2)(s+5)} \\right|_{s=-1} = \\frac{-1+4}{(-1-2)(-1+5)} = \\frac{3}{(-3)(4)} = -\\frac{1}{4}\n$$\n$$\nC = \\lim_{s \\to -5} (s+5)Y(s) = \\left. \\frac{s+4}{(s-2)(s+1)} \\right|_{s=-5} = \\frac{-5+4}{(-5-2)(-5+1)} = \\frac{-1}{(-7)(-4)} = -\\frac{1}{28}\n$$\nSo, the expanded form of $Y(s)$ is:\n$$\nY(s) = \\frac{2/7}{s-2} - \\frac{1/4}{s+1} - \\frac{1/28}{s+5}\n$$\nTaking the inverse Laplace transform term by term gives $y(t)$ for $t \\ge 0$:\n$$\ny(t) = \\frac{2}{7}\\mathcal{L}^{-1}\\left\\{\\frac{1}{s-2}\\right\\} - \\frac{1}{4}\\mathcal{L}^{-1}\\left\\{\\frac{1}{s+1}\\right\\} - \\frac{1}{28}\\mathcal{L}^{-1}\\left\\{\\frac{1}{s+5}\\right\\}\n$$\n$$\ny(t) = \\frac{2}{7}\\exp(2t) - \\frac{1}{4}\\exp(-t) - \\frac{1}{28}\\exp(-5t)\n$$\nThe problem states that the plant state $x_p(t)$ is equal to the plant output $y(t)$.

For constant steady state $(\\dot{x} = 0)$,\n$$\n0 = A x_{\\mathrm{ss}} + B u_{\\mathrm{ss}}, \\quad y_{\\mathrm{ss}} = C x_{\\mathrm{ss}}.\n$$\nSolving $x_{\\mathrm{ss}} = -A^{-1} B u_{\\mathrm{ss}}$ (since $A$ is nonsingular) gives\n$$\ny_{\\mathrm{ss}} = C x_{\\mathrm{ss}} = - C A^{-1} B \\, u_{\\mathrm{ss}}.\n$$\nTo enforce $y_{\\mathrm{ss}} = r$ for arbitrary constant $r$, choose $u_{\\mathrm{ss}} = N r$ with\n$$\nN = \\left( - C A^{-1} B \\right)^{-1}.\n$$\nWe compute $A^{-1} B$ by solving $A v = B$:\n$$\n\\begin{bmatrix} 0  1 \\\\ -2  -3 \\end{bmatrix} \\begin{bmatrix} v_{1} \\\\ v_{2} \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{bmatrix}\n\\;\\; \\Rightarrow \\;\\; v_{2} = 0, \\; -2 v_{1} = 1 \\;\\; \\Rightarrow \\;\\; v_{1} = -\\frac{1}{2}.\n$$\nThus $A^{-1} B = \\begin{bmatrix} -\\frac{1}{2} \\\\ 0 \\end{bmatrix}$ and\n$$\n- C A^{-1} B = - \\begin{bmatrix} 1  0 \\end{bmatrix} \\begin{bmatrix} -\\frac{1}{2} \\\\ 0 \\end{bmatrix} = \\frac{1}{2},\n$$\nso\n$$\nN = \\left( \\frac{1}{2} \\right)^{-1} = 2.\n$$\n\nTo compare dynamical behavior, consider the tracking error $e(t) = y(t) - r(t)$ under the open-loop feedforward $u(t) = N r(t)$ for the unit step $r(t) = 1 \\cdot \\mathbf{1}_{\\{t \\ge 0\\}}$ and zero initial state $x(0) = 0$. For $t \\ge 0$, $u(t) = N$. The state obeys $\\dot{x} = A x + B N$ with constant input, and the steady state satisfies $x_{\\mathrm{ss}} = -A^{-1} B N$ and $y_{\\mathrm{ss}} = C x_{\\mathrm{ss}} = r = 1$. The error dynamics are given by\n$$\n\\dot{e}(t) = \\frac{d}{dt} \\left( C x(t) - r \\right) = C \\dot{x}(t) = C A x(t) + C B N = C A \\left( x(t) - x_{\\mathrm{ss}} \\right),\n$$\nsince $C B N = - C A x_{\\mathrm{ss}}$. Therefore $e(t)$ evolves under the homogeneous dynamics governed by $A$, and its poles are the eigenvalues of $A$, which are the roots of $s^{2} + 3 s + 2 = 0$, namely\n$$\ns_{\\mathrm{ol},1} = -1, \\quad s_{\\mathrm{ol},2} = -2.\n$$\n\nCollecting the requested quantities in the prescribed order:\n- $k_{1} = -2 + \\sqrt{5}$,\n- $k_{2} = -2 + \\sqrt{5}$,\n- $s_{\\mathrm{cl},1} = -1$,\n- $s_{\\mathrm{cl},2} = -\\sqrt{5}$,\n- $N = 2$,\n- $s_{\\mathrm{ol},1} = -1$,\n- $s_{\\mathrm{ol},2} = -2$.\n\nThis shows that the state-feedback LQR shifts one pole from $-2$ to $-\\sqrt{5}$ while leaving the other at $-1$, whereas the purely open-loop feedforward error dynamics retain the plant’s open-loop poles $-1$ and $-2$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix}-2+\\sqrt{5}  -2+\\sqrt{5}  -1  -\\sqrt{5}  2  -1  -2\\end{pmatrix}}$$", "id": "2730005"}]}
