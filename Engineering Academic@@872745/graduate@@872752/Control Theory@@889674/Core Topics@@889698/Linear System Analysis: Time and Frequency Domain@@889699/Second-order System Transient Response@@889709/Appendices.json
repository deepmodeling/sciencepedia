It represents a fundamental problem in the analysis of linear time-invariant systems. We may proceed with the solution.\n\nThe impulse response of a causal LTI system, denoted as $g(t)$, is the inverse Laplace transform of its transfer function $G(s)$. The problem provides the transfer function for a standard second-order system:\n$$G(s)=\\dfrac{\\omega_{n}^{2}}{s^{2}+2\\zeta \\omega_{n} s+\\omega_{n}^{2}}$$\nwhere $\\omega_{n}0$ is the natural frequency and $\\zeta \\in (0,1)$ specifies the underdamped case. We are tasked to find $g(t) = \\mathcal{L}^{-1}\\{G(s)\\}$.\n\nTo find the inverse transform, we must first manipulate the denominator by completing the square:\n$$s^{2}+2\\zeta \\omega_{n} s+\\omega_{n}^{2} = (s^{2}+2\\zeta \\omega_{n} s + (\\zeta\\omega_{n})^{2}) - (\\zeta\\omega_{n})^{2} + \\omega_{n}^{2} = (s+\\zeta\\omega_{n})^{2} + \\omega_{n}^{2}(1-\\zeta^{2})$$\nSince $\\zeta \\in (0,1)$, the term $1-\\zeta^{2}$ is positive. We define the damped natural frequency, $\\omega_{d}$, as:\n$$\\omega_{d} = \\omega_{n}\\sqrt{1-\\zeta^{2}}$$\nWith this definition, the transfer function becomes:\n$$G(s) = \\dfrac{\\omega_{n}^{2}}{(s+\\zeta\\omega_{n})^{2} + \\omega_{d}^{2}}$$\nTo match the standard Laplace transform pair for a damped sinusoid, $\\mathcal{L}\\{\\exp(-at)\\sin(bt)\\} = \\dfrac{b}{(s+a)^{2}+b^{2}}$, we adjust the numerator:\n$$G(s) = \\dfrac{\\omega_{n}^{2}}{\\omega_{d}} \\cdot \\dfrac{\\omega_{d}}{(s+\\zeta\\omega_{n})^{2} + \\omega_{d}^{2}}$$\nThe inverse Laplace transform is now identifiable by inspection. For a causal system where $g(t)=0$ for $t0$, we have:\n$$g(t) = \\dfrac{\\omega_{n}^{2}}{\\omega_{d}} \\exp(-\\zeta\\omega_{n} t) \\sin(\\omega_{d} t), \\quad t \\ge 0$$\nSubstituting the expressions for $\\omega_{d}$, we obtain the full expression for $g(t)$:\n$$g(t) = \\dfrac{\\omega_{n}^{2}}{\\omega_{n}\\sqrt{1-\\zeta^{2}}} \\exp(-\\zeta\\omega_{n} t) \\sin\\left(\\omega_{n}\\sqrt{1-\\zeta^{2}} t\\right) = \\dfrac{\\omega_{n}}{\\sqrt{1-\\zeta^{2}}} \\exp(-\\zeta\\omega_{n} t) \\sin\\left(\\omega_{n}\\sqrt{1-\\zeta^{2}} t\\right)$$\nThis expression is in the required canonical form $g(t)=A \\exp(-\\alpha t)\\sin(\\beta t)$, with the parameters identified as:\n$$A = \\dfrac{\\omega_{n}}{\\sqrt{1-\\zeta^{2}}}, \\quad \\alpha = \\zeta\\omega_{n}, \\quad \\beta = \\omega_{n}\\sqrt{1-\\zeta^{2}}$$\n\nNext, we compute the initial slope $g'(0^{+})$.

Second, the derived expression for $y(t)$ is used to analytically determine if overshoot is possible.\n\nPart 1: Derivation of the Step Response $y(t)$\n\nThe input-output relationship for a linear time-invariant (LTI) system in the Laplace domain is given by:\n$$\nY(s) = G(s) U(s)\n$$\nwhere $Y(s)$ is the Laplace transform of the output $y(t)$, $G(s)$ is the system's transfer function, and $U(s)$ is the Laplace transform of the input $u(t)$.\n\nThe system is subjected to a unit step input, $u(t) = 1$ for $t \\ge 0$.

This requires a partial fraction expansion. The expression for $Y(s)$ has a simple pole at $s = 0$ and a repeated pole of order $2$ at $s = -\\omega_n$. The expansion has the form:\n$$\nY(s) = \\frac{A}{s} + \\frac{B}{s + \\omega_n} + \\frac{C}{(s + \\omega_n)^{2}}\n$$\nThe coefficients $A$, $B$, and $C$ are determined as follows.\n\nThe coefficient $A$ is found using the residue method for the simple pole at $s=0$:\n$$\nA = \\lim_{s \\to 0} s Y(s) = \\lim_{s \\to 0} \\frac{\\omega_n^{2}}{(s + \\omega_n)^{2}} = \\frac{\\omega_n^{2}}{(0 + \\omega_n)^{2}} = \\frac{\\omega_n^{2}}{\\omega_n^{2}} = 1\n$$\nThe coefficient $C$ is found for the highest-order term of the repeated pole at $s=-\\omega_n$:\n$$\nC = \\lim_{s \\to -\\omega_n} (s + \\omega_n)^{2} Y(s) = \\lim_{s \\to -\\omega_n} \\frac{\\omega_n^{2}}{s} = \\frac{\\omega_n^{2}}{-\\omega_n} = -\\omega_n\n$$\nThe coefficient $B$ is found for the lower-order term of the repeated pole:\n$$\nB = \\lim_{s \\to -\\omega_n} \\frac{1}{(2-1)!} \\frac{d}{ds} \\left[ (s + \\omega_n)^{2} Y(s) \\right] = \\lim_{s \\to -\\omega_n} \\frac{d}{ds} \\left( \\frac{\\omega_n^{2}}{s} \\right)\n$$\n$$\nB = \\lim_{s \\to -\\omega_n} \\left( -\\frac{\\omega_n^{2}}{s^{2}} \\right) = -\\frac{\\omega_n^{2}}{(-\\omega_n)^{2}} = -\\frac{\\omega_n^{2}}{\\omega_n^{2}} = -1\n$$\nSubstituting the coefficients $A=1$, $B=-1$, and $C=-\\omega_n$ back into the expansion gives:\n$$\nY(s) = \\frac{1}{s} - \\frac{1}{s + \\omega_n} - \\frac{\\omega_n}{(s + \\omega_n)^{2}}\n$$\nThe time-domain response $y(t)$ is the inverse Laplace transform of $Y(s)$.

The input is a unit step, and the DC gain of the system is $G(0) = \\frac{\\omega_n^2}{\\omega_n^2} = 1$. Therefore, the final value of the output is $\\lim_{t \\to \\infty} y(t) = 1$. Overshoot would imply that $y(t)  1$ for some time $t  0$.\n\nWe can analyze this from first principles by examining the derivative of $y(t)$. An overshoot would require the function $y(t)$ to increase past $y=1$ and then decrease, which necessitates that its derivative, $\\dot{y}(t)$, must be zero at some peak time $t_p  0$ where $y(t_p)  1$.\n\nLet's compute the derivative of $y(t)$:\n$$\n\\dot{y}(t) = \\frac{d}{dt} \\left[ 1 - (1 + \\omega_n t)e^{-\\omega_n t} \\right]\n$$\nUsing the product rule for the second term:\n$$\n\\dot{y}(t) = 0 - \\left[ (\\omega_n)e^{-\\omega_n t} + (1 + \\omega_n t)(-\\omega_n e^{-\\omega_n t}) \\right]\n$$\n$$\n\\dot{y}(t) = - \\left[ \\omega_n e^{-\\omega_n t} - \\omega_n e^{-\\omega_n t} - \\omega_n^2 t e^{-\\omega_n t} \\right]\n$$\n$$\n\\dot{y}(t) = \\omega_n^2 t e^{-\\omega_n t}\n$$\nWe analyze the sign of $\\dot{y}(t)$ for $t \\ge 0$. The parameter $\\omega_n$ is given as $\\omega_n  0$, so $\\omega_n^2  0$. The exponential term $e^{-\\omega_n t}$ is strictly positive for all finite $t$. The time variable $t$ is non-negative, $t \\ge 0$.\nTherefore, for all $t  0$, every factor in the expression for $\\dot{y}(t)$ is strictly positive. This means $\\dot{y}(t)  0$ for all $t  0$. At $t=0$, $\\dot{y}(0) = 0$.\n\nSince the derivative $\\dot{y}(t)$ is non-negative for all $t \\ge 0$, the function $y(t)$ is monotonically non-decreasing. The system starts at rest, which we can verify: $y(0) = 1 - (1 + 0)e^0 = 1 - 1 = 0$. The function $y(t)$ starts at $0$ and increases monotonically towards its final value of $1$. A monotonically increasing function can never exceed its limiting value.\n\nThus, $y(t) \\le 1$ for all $t \\ge 0$. No overshoot is possible for a critically damped second-order system.

We can thus find a root by searching for the first time $t>0$ where $f_\\alpha(t) \\ge 0$.\n    A simple and effective bracketing algorithm starts with a small interval $[0, \\Delta t]$ and iteratively expands it. We set $t_{low} = 0$ and check the sign of $f_\\alpha(t)$ at $t_{high} = k\\Delta t$ for $k=1, 2, \\dots$. A suitable step size $\\Delta t$ should be chosen relative to the system's characteristic time, such as $\\Delta t = c/\\omega_n$ for some small constant $c$. Once we find a $t_{high}$ for which $f_\\alpha(t_{high}) \\ge 0$, the bracket is established as $[t_{low}, t_{high}]$.\n\n2.  **Root Finding**: Once a bracket $[a, b]$ is found, a reliable numerical root-finding algorithm can be employed. The Brent-Dekker method, implemented in `scipy.optimize.brentq`, is an excellent choice. It combines the speed of secant/interpolation methods with the robustness of bisection, guaranteeing convergence if a valid bracket is provided. This method will find the root $t_\\alpha$ to a high degree of precision.\n\nThe rise time is then computed as $t_r = t_{0.9} - t_{0.1}$.
