It presents a standard exercise in Lyapunov stability theory, a fundamental topic in the study of dynamical systems and control theory. All definitions provided are standard and correct. The system $\\dot{x}=-x^3$ is a simple, well-defined nonlinear system. The problem is self-contained, providing all necessary information for its solution. It does not violate any physical laws, contain contradictions, or rely on subjective claims. Therefore, the problem is deemed valid.\n\nThe solution proceeds by addressing the four required steps.\n\nStep 1: Propose a Lyapunov candidate $V(x)$.\nWe seek a polynomial function $V(x)$ of minimal degree that is continuously differentiable ($C^{1}$) and positive definite. A polynomial is positive definite only if its lowest-degree term is of even power with a positive coefficient.\nA polynomial of degree $0$ is a constant, which cannot satisfy $V(0)=0$ and $V(x)0$ for $x\\neq 0$.\nA polynomial of degree $1$, $V(x)=ax$ for $a\\neq 0$, is not positive definite as it takes both positive and negative values.\nThus, the minimal possible degree is $2$. Let us consider a general candidate of degree $2$: $V(x) = cx^{2}$ for some constant $c$. For $V(x)$ to be positive definite, we require $c0$.\nLet us check if such a function can certify stability. The derivative of $V(x)$ along the trajectories of $\\dot{x}=-x^{3}$ is:\n$$\n\\dot{V}(x) = \\frac{dV}{dx}\\dot{x} = (2cx)(-x^{3}) = -2cx^{4}\n$$\nSince $c0$, the term $-2c$ is strictly negative. For any $x\\neq 0$, $x^{4}0$, which implies $\\dot{V}(x)0$. This satisfies the condition for a Lyapunov function. Therefore, a polynomial of degree $2$ is sufficient.\nA simple and valid choice is to set the constant $c=\\frac{1}{2}$. This choice simplifies the expression for $\\dot{V}(x)$.\nThe proposed Lyapunov candidate is $V(x) = \\frac{1}{2}x^{2}$. This function is a polynomial, and thus is continuously differentiable everywhere.\n\nStep 2: Verify positive definiteness of $V(x)$.\nThe proposed function is $V(x) = \\frac{1}{2}x^{2}$.\n- At the origin: $V(0) = \\frac{1}{2}(0)^{2} = 0$. This condition is met.\n- For any $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$ such that $x \\neq 0$, it is a fact that $x^{2}  0$. Since $\\frac{1}{2}$ is a positive constant, their product is positive: $V(x) = \\frac{1}{2}x^{2}  0$.\nBoth conditions for positive definiteness are satisfied.\n\nStep 3: Compute $\\dot{V}(x)$ and verify its sign condition.\nThe time derivative of $V(x)$ along the system trajectories is computed using the chain rule:\n$$\n\\dot{V}(x) = \\frac{d}{dt}V(x(t)) = \\frac{dV}{dx}\\frac{dx}{dt} = \\frac{dV}{dx}\\dot{x}\n$$\nWith $V(x) = \\frac{1}{2}x^{2}$ and $\\dot{x} = -x^{3}$, we have:\n$$\n\\frac{dV}{dx} = \\frac{d}{dx}\\left(\\frac{1}{2}x^{2}\\right) = x\n$$\nSubstituting this into the expression for $\\dot{V}(x)$:\n$$\n\\dot{V}(x) = (x)(-x^{3}) = -x^{4}\n$$\nNow, we must verify that $\\dot{V}(x)  0$ for all $x \\neq 0$. The term $x^{4}$ is the fourth power of a real number. For any $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$ such that $x \\neq 0$, we have $x^{4}  0$. Consequently, $\\dot{V}(x) = -x^{4}  0$ for all $x \\neq 0$.\nThe condition on $\\dot{V}(x)$ is satisfied. The function $V(x)=\\frac{1}{2}x^2$ is a strict Lyapunov function for the given system.\n\nStep 4: Exhibit explicit comparison functions.\nWe must find class $\\mathcal{K}_{\\infty}$ functions $\\alpha_{1}$, $\\alpha_{2}$, and $\\alpha_{3}$ satisfying the inequalities. Let $s = |x|$. We have $V(x) = \\frac{1}{2}x^{2} = \\frac{1}{2}|x|^{2} = \\frac{1}{2}s^{2}$ and $\\dot{V}(x) = -x^{4} = -|x|^{4} = -s^{4}$.\nThe inequalities are:\n1. $\\alpha_{1}(s) \\le \\frac{1}{2}s^{2}$\n2. $\\frac{1}{2}s^{2} \\le \\alpha_{2}(s)$\n3. $-s^{4} \\le -\\alpha_{3}(s)$, which is equivalent to $\\alpha_{3}(s) \\le s^{4}$\n\nWe select simple power functions of the form $\\alpha(s) = cs^{p}$ with $c0$ and $p0$. Such functions are continuous, strictly increasing on $[0,\\infty)$, satisfy $\\alpha(0)=0$, and diverge to $\\infty$ as $s\\to\\infty$, thus belonging to class $\\mathcal{K}_{\\infty}$.\n\n- For $\\alpha_{1}(s)$: We need $\\alpha_1(s) \\le \\frac{1}{2}s^2$. We can choose $\\alpha_{1}(s) = \\frac{1}{2}s^{2}$. This function is of class $\\mathcal{K}_{\\infty}$ (with $c=\\frac{1}{2}$, $p=2$) and satisfies the inequality with equality.\n- For $\\alpha_{2}(s)$: We need $\\frac{1}{2}s^2 \\le \\alpha_2(s)$. We can choose $\\alpha_{2}(s) = \\frac{1}{2}s^{2}$. This is the same function as $\\alpha_1(s)$, is of class $\\mathcal{K}_{\\infty}$, and satisfies the inequality with equality. We could also choose $\\alpha_{2}(s) = s^{2}$ or any function $cs^2$ with $c \\ge \\frac{1}{2}$.\n- For $\\alpha_{3}(s)$: We need $\\alpha_3(s) \\le s^4$. We can choose $\\alpha_{3}(s) = s^{4}$. This function is of class $\\mathcal{K}_{\\infty}$ (with $c=1$, $p=4$) and satisfies the inequality with equality.\n\nOur explicit choices are:\n- $\\alpha_{1}(s) = \\frac{1}{2}s^{2}$\n- $\\alpha_{2}(s) = \\frac{1}{2}s^{2}$\n- $\\alpha_{3}(s) = s^{4}$\n\nThese functions satisfy all required properties.\n\nConclusion:\nWe have constructed a strict Lyapunov function $V(x) = \\frac{1}{2}x^{2}$ for the system $\\dot{x}=-x^3$ with equilibrium at the origin. The existence of such a function proves that the origin is an asymptotically stable equilibrium point. Furthermore, the existence of the class $\\mathcal{K}_{\\infty}$ functions $\\alpha_1, \\alpha_2, \\alpha_3$ satisfying the specified bounds proves that the origin is globally asymptotically stable.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\frac{1}{2}x^{2}}\n$$", "id": "2721650"}, {"introduction": "While a strictly negative definite derivative of a Lyapunov function proves asymptotic stability, many systems only satisfy a weaker condition where the derivative is negative semi-definite.

We shall proceed with the solution, addressing each task in sequence.\n\nTask A. Analysis of Stability Conditions.\n\nAn equilibrium point, taken to be the origin $x=0$, of the autonomous system $\\dot{x}=f(x)$ where $x \\in \\mathbb{R}^{2}$ is said to be stable in the sense of Lyapunov if for any given $\\epsilon  0$, there exists a $\\delta(\\epsilon)  0$ such that if $\\|x(0)\\|  \\delta$, then $\\|x(t)\\|  \\epsilon$ for all $t \\ge 0$.\n\nSufficient conditions for Lyapunov stability of the origin can be established using a continuously differentiable candidate Lyapunov function $V:\\mathbb{R}^{2} \\to \\mathbb{R}_{\\ge 0}$. The conditions are as follows:\n$1$. $V(x)$ is positive definite in a neighborhood $D$ of the origin. This means $V(0)=0$ and $V(x)  0$ for all $x \\in D \\setminus \\{0\\}$.\n$2$. The time derivative of $V(x)$ along the system's trajectories, $\\dot{V}(x) = \\nabla V(x) \\cdot f(x)$, is negative semi-definite in $D$. This means $\\dot{V}(x) \\le 0$ for all $x \\in D$.\n\nThese conditions guarantee stability because the level sets of $V(x)$ form closed boundaries around the origin. A trajectory starting inside a level set $V(x)=c$ must remain within the set $\\{x \\mid V(x) \\le c\\}$ for all future time, since $\\dot{V}(x) \\le 0$ prevents the value of $V(x(t))$ from increasing. This directly implies that by choosing a sufficiently small initial neighborhood (defined by a small level of $V$), the trajectory can be confined within any larger, desired neighborhood, thus satisfying the definition of Lyapunov stability.\n\nThese conditions do not, by themselves, guarantee asymptotic stability. An equilibrium is asymptotically stable if it is stable and all trajectories starting sufficiently close to it converge to it as $t \\to \\infty$. The condition $\\dot{V}(x) \\le 0$ allows for the possibility that $\\dot{V}(x)=0$ along trajectories that are not the equilibrium point itself. If a trajectory enters a region where $\\dot{V}(x)=0$ and remains there, the value of $V(x)$ ceases to decrease, and the trajectory may converge to a point or a set other than the origin.\n\nTo guarantee asymptotic stability, an additional condition is required. This is provided by LaSalle's Invariance Principle (LIP). Let $\\Omega \\subset D$ be a compact, positively invariant set with respect to $\\dot{x}=f(x)$. Let $V(x)$ be a continuously differentiable function such that $\\dot{V}(x) \\le 0$ in $\\Omega$. Let $E = \\{x \\in \\Omega \\mid \\dot{V}(x) = 0\\}$. According to LIP, any solution starting in $\\Omega$ approaches $M$, the largest invariant set contained in $E$. Therefore, the additional structural property required to conclude asymptotic stability of the origin is that the largest invariant set $M$ contained in $\\{x \\mid \\dot{V}(x)=0\\}$ must consist only of the origin, i.e., $M=\\{0\\}$.\n\nTask B. Analysis of the Specific System.\n\nThe system under consideration is given by the equations:\n$$\n\\dot x_{1}=-x_{1}^{3}\n$$\n$$\n\\dot x_{2}=0\n$$\nThe proposed candidate Lyapunov function is $V(x) = \\frac{1}{2}(x_{1}^{2}+x_{2}^{2})$.\n\nFirst, we verify the properties of $V(x)$.\n- **Positive definiteness**: $V(0,0) = \\frac{1}{2}(0^{2}+0^{2}) = 0$. For any $x=(x_{1},x_{2})^{\\top} \\neq (0,0)^{\\top}$, at least one of $x_{1}$ or $x_{2}$ is non-zero. Since $x_{1}^{2} \\ge 0$ and $x_{2}^{2} \\ge 0$, their sum $x_{1}^{2}+x_{2}^{2}$ is strictly positive. Thus, $V(x)  0$ for all $x \\neq 0$. The function is positive definite on all of $\\mathbb{R}^{2}$.\n- **Radial unboundedness**: The function $V(x)$ can be written as $V(x) = \\frac{1}{2}\\|x\\|_{2}^{2}$. As $\\|x\\|_{2} \\to \\infty$, it is clear that $V(x) \\to \\infty$. The function is radially unbounded.\n\nNext, we compute the derivative of $V$ along the system's trajectories:\n$$\n\\dot{V}(x) = \\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial x_{1}}\\dot{x}_{1} + \\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial x_{2}}\\dot{x}_{2} = (x_{1})(-x_{1}^{3}) + (x_{2})(0) = -x_{1}^{4}\n$$\nSince $x_{1}^{4} \\ge 0$ for all $x_{1} \\in \\mathbb{R}$, we have $\\dot{V}(x) \\le 0$ for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}^{2}$. The derivative is negative semi-definite.\n\nThe existence of a positive definite, radially unbounded function $V(x)$ with $\\dot{V}(x) \\le 0$ is sufficient to conclude that the origin is stable in the sense of Lyapunov. The radial unboundedness ensures that the level sets are compact, and thus any trajectory is bounded for all time.\n\nTo assess asymptotic stability, we apply LaSalle's Invariance Principle. We define the set $E$ where $\\dot{V}(x)=0$:\n$$\nE = \\{ x \\in \\mathbb{R}^{2} \\mid \\dot{V}(x)=0 \\} = \\{ x \\in \\mathbb{R}^{2} \\mid -x_{1}^{4}=0 \\} = \\{ x \\in \\mathbb{R}^{2} \\mid x_{1}=0 \\}\n$$\nThis set is the $x_{2}$-axis.\n\nNow, we find the largest invariant set $M$ contained in $E$. A trajectory $x(t)$ that remains in $E$ must satisfy $x_{1}(t)=0$ for all $t$. If $x_{1}(t)=0$, then its time derivative must also be zero, $\\dot{x}_{1}(t)=0$. The first system equation is $\\dot{x}_{1} = -x_{1}^{3}$. Substituting $x_{1}=0$ gives $0=-0^{3}$, which is satisfied. The second system equation is $\\dot{x}_{2}=0$, which integrates to $x_{2}(t)=C$, where $C$ is a constant. Thus, any trajectory of the form $x(t)=(0, C)^{\\top}$ is a valid trajectory of the system and lies entirely within $E$. The set of all such points is the entire $x_{2}$-axis. Therefore, the largest invariant set $M$ contained in $E$ is $E$ itself:\n$$\nM = \\{ x \\in \\mathbb{R}^{2} \\mid x_{1}=0 \\}\n$$\nAccording to LIP, all trajectories of the system converge to this set $M$. Since $M$ is not the singleton set $\\{0\\}$, the origin is not asymptotically stable. The system is stable, but not asymptotically stable. Any trajectory starting at $x(0)=(\\alpha, \\beta)^{\\top}$ will converge to the point $(0, \\beta)^{\\top}$ on the $x_{2}$-axis.\n\nTask C. Explicit Calculation of Trajectory Limit.\n\nWe are given the system of differential equations with initial conditions $x(0)=(\\alpha, \\beta)^{\\top}$:\n$1$. $\\dot{x}_{1} = -x_{1}^{3}$, with $x_{1}(0) = \\alpha$.\n$2$. $\\dot{x}_{2} = 0$, with $x_{2}(0) = \\beta$.\n\nFrom the second equation, $\\dot{x}_{2}(t)=0$, we integrate to find $x_{2}(t) = C$ for some constant $C$. Using the initial condition $x_{2}(0)=\\beta$, we determine that $C=\\beta$. Therefore, $x_{2}(t)=\\beta$ for all $t \\ge 0$.\n\nThe first equation, $\\frac{dx_{1}}{dt} = -x_{1}^{3}$, is a separable ordinary differential equation.\nIf $\\alpha=0$, then $x_{1}(0)=0$ is an equilibrium for this equation, so $x_{1}(t)=0$ for all $t$.\nIf $\\alpha \\neq 0$, we can separate variables:\n$$\n\\frac{dx_{1}}{x_{1}^{3}} = -dt\n$$\nIntegrating both sides from $t=0$ to $t$:\n$$\n\\int_{\\alpha}^{x_{1}(t)} s^{-3} ds = \\int_{0}^{t} -1 d\\tau\n$$\n$$\n\\left[ -\\frac{1}{2}s^{-2} \\right]_{\\alpha}^{x_{1}(t)} = -t\n$$\n$$\n-\\frac{1}{2x_{1}(t)^{2}} + \\frac{1}{2\\alpha^{2}} = -t\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{1}{2x_{1}(t)^{2}} = t + \\frac{1}{2\\alpha^{2}}\n$$\n$$\nx_{1}(t)^{2} = \\frac{1}{2t + \\frac{1}{\\alpha^{2}}} = \\frac{\\alpha^{2}}{2\\alpha^{2}t + 1}\n$$\nTaking the square root, we must choose the sign that matches the initial condition $x_{1}(0)=\\alpha$.\n$$\nx_{1}(t) = \\frac{\\alpha}{\\sqrt{2\\alpha^{2}t + 1}}\n$$\nThis formula also correctly yields $x_{1}(t)=0$ for the case $\\alpha=0$.\n\nNow we compute the limit of the solution $x(t)=(x_{1}(t), x_{2}(t))^{\\top}$ as $t \\to \\infty$.\nThe limit of the first component is:\n$$\n\\lim_{t\\to\\infty} x_{1}(t) = \\lim_{t\\to\\infty} \\frac{\\alpha}{\\sqrt{2\\alpha^{2}t + 1}} = 0\n$$\nThe limit of the second component is:\n$$\n\\lim_{t\\to\\infty} x_{2}(t) = \\lim_{t\\to\\infty} \\beta = \\beta\n$$\nThus, the limit of the trajectory is:\n$$\n\\lim_{t\\to\\infty} x(t) = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ \\beta \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThis result confirms the conclusion from Task B that every trajectory converges to a point on the $x_{2}$-axis, specifically to the point determined by its initial $x_{2}$ value.

This implies $2x_2 \\neq 0$, or $x_2 \\neq 0$.\nThe control law is:\n$$\nu(x_1, x_2) = -\\frac{(-2x_1^2 + 2x_1x_2) + \\sqrt{(-2x_1^2 + 2x_1x_2)^2 + (2x_2)^4}}{2x_2}\n$$\nSimplifying the expression:\n$$\nu(x_1, x_2) = -\\frac{-2x_1^2 + 2x_1x_2 + \\sqrt{4x_1^2(x_2-x_1)^2 + 16x_2^4}}{2x_2}\n$$\n$$\nu(x_1, x_2) = -\\frac{-2x_1^2 + 2x_1x_2 + 2\\sqrt{x_1^2(x_2-x_1)^2 + 4x_2^4}}{2x_2}\n$$\n$$\nu(x_1, x_2) = -\\frac{-x_1^2 + x_1x_2 + \\sqrt{x_1^2(x_2-x_1)^2 + 4x_2^4}}{x_2}\n$$\n\nCase 2: $L_gV(x) = 0$. This implies $x_2 = 0$.\nAccording to the formula, the control law is:\n$$\nu(x_1, 0) = 0\n$$\n\nThe problem requires a continuous control law. We must verify that the expression for $u(x_1, x_2)$ is continuous as $x_2 \\to 0$. We evaluate the limit of the expression from Case 1 as $x_2 \\to 0$. This yields an indeterminate form of type $\\frac{0}{0}$:\n$$\n\\lim_{x_2 \\to 0} -\\frac{-x_1^2 + x_1x_2 + \\sqrt{x_1^2(x_2-x_1)^2 + 4x_2^4}}{x_2}\n$$\nAs $x_2 \\to 0$, the numerator approaches $-x_1^2 + \\sqrt{x_1^2(-x_1)^2} = -x_1^2 + \\sqrt{x_1^4} = -x_1^2 + x_1^2 = 0$.\nApplying L'Hôpital's rule by differentiating the numerator and denominator with respect to $x_2$ (treating $x_1$ as a constant) is complicated. A simpler algebraic manipulation is preferred. Multiply by the conjugate of the numerator:\n$$\nu = -\\frac{\\left(-x_1^2 + x_1x_2 + \\sqrt{\\dots}\\right)}{x_2} \\times \\frac{\\left(-x_1^2 + x_1x_2 - \\sqrt{\\dots}\\right)}{\\left(-x_1^2 + x_1x_2 - \\sqrt{\\dots}\\right)}\n$$\n$$\nu = -\\frac{(-x_1^2 + x_1x_2)^2 - (x_1^2(x_2-x_1)^2 + 4x_2^4)}{x_2(-x_1^2 + x_1x_2 - \\sqrt{x_1^2(x_2-x_1)^2 + 4x_2^4})}\n$$\nThe numerator expands to $x_1^2(x_1-x_2)^2 - x_1^2(x_2-x_1)^2 - 4x_2^4 = -4x_2^4$.\n$$\nu = -\\frac{-4x_2^4}{x_2(-x_1^2 + x_1x_2 - \\sqrt{\\dots})} = \\frac{4x_2^3}{-x_1^2 + x_1x_2 - \\sqrt{x_1^2(x_2-x_1)^2 + 4x_2^4}}\n$$\nTaking the limit as $x_2 \\to 0$:\n$$\n\\lim_{x_2 \\to 0} u(x_1, x_2) = \\frac{0}{-x_1^2 - \\sqrt{x_1^4}} = \\frac{0}{-2x_1^2} = 0\n$$\nfor any $x_1 \\neq 0$. If $x_1=0$, then $L_fV=0$ and $u(0, x_2) = -\\frac{\\sqrt{(2x_2)^4}}{2x_2} = -\\frac{4x_2^2}{2x_2} = -2x_2$, which also approaches $0$ as $x_2 \\to 0$.\nSince the limit is $0$ in all cases, which matches the definition for $x_2=0$, the synthesized control law is continuous everywhere.\n\nThe complete, explicit control law is given by the piecewise function.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\nu(x_1, x_2) = \\begin{cases} -\\frac{-x_1^2 + x_1x_2 + \\sqrt{x_1^2(x_2-x_1)^2 + 4x_2^4}}{x_2}  \\text{if } x_2 \\neq 0 \\\\ 0  \\text{if } x_2 = 0 \\end{cases}\n}\n$$", "id": "2721666"}]}
