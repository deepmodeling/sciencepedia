## Applications and Interdisciplinary Connections

The preceding chapters have established the theoretical foundations of the circle and Popov criteria, grounded in the principles of Lyapunov stability and passivity. These frequency-domain tools provide [sufficient conditions](@entry_id:269617) for the [absolute stability](@entry_id:165194) of feedback interconnections containing a linear time-invariant (LTI) system and a static, memoryless nonlinearity confined to a specific sector. This chapter transitions from theory to practice, exploring how these powerful criteria are applied in diverse engineering contexts and how they connect to other fundamental concepts in control theory and dynamical systems.

Our focus will be on demonstrating the utility and versatility of these methods. We will begin by examining how common nonlinear phenomena encountered in engineering systems, such as [actuator saturation](@entry_id:274581) and dead-zones, can be rigorously modeled using sector bounds. Subsequently, we will present case studies that apply the criteria to certify stability and quantify performance limits. Finally, we will broaden our perspective to explore advanced techniques and the rich interplay between [absolute stability](@entry_id:165194) theory, [robust control](@entry_id:260994), and other analytical frameworks. The objective is not to re-derive the core principles, but to illuminate their application, demonstrating their role as indispensable tools for the analysis and design of [nonlinear control systems](@entry_id:167557).

### Modeling and Analysis of Common Engineering Nonlinearities

A crucial first step in applying [absolute stability](@entry_id:165194) criteria is to represent the system's nonlinear components within the sector-bound framework. Many physical devices and phenomena exhibit nonlinear behavior that, while complex, can be effectively captured by such bounds for the purpose of stability analysis.

#### Actuator Saturation

Perhaps the most ubiquitous nonlinearity in [control systems](@entry_id:155291) is [actuator saturation](@entry_id:274581). Physical actuators—such as motors, valves, and amplifiers—have finite operational ranges and cannot produce outputs beyond certain physical limits. A [standard model](@entry_id:137424) for this behavior is the saturation function. For a desired control signal $v(t)$, the actual actuator output $u(t)$ might be described by $\phi(v) = \mathrm{sat}_{M}(kv)$, where $k$ is a nominal gain in the linear region and $M$ is the saturation level. Despite the presence of a sharp "corner" at the onset of saturation, this nonlinearity can be contained within a simple sector. The ratio $\phi(v)/v$ takes a value of $k$ in the linear region ($|kv| \le M$) and decreases towards zero as $|v| \to \infty$ in the saturated region. Therefore, for any saturation level $M0$, the function is contained within the tight sector $[0, k]$. This crucial observation allows a system with [actuator saturation](@entry_id:274581) to be analyzed using the circle or Popov criteria for the sector $[0, k]$, independent of the specific value of the saturation limit $M$ [@problem_id:2689022]. This class of nonlinearities includes both "hard" saturation (piecewise linear) and "soft" saturation models, such as $\phi(v) = v/(1+|v|/u_{\max})$, both of which are bounded by the sector $[0, 1]$ when the linear-region gain is unity [@problem_id:2689988].

#### Dead-Zone

Another common nonlinearity, particularly in mechanical systems and valves, is the dead-zone. In such systems, a certain minimum input signal is required before any output is produced. A symmetric dead-zone can be modeled as $\phi(e) = 0$ for $|e| \le \delta$ and $\phi(e) = k(e - \delta \mathrm{sgn}(e))$ for $|e|  \delta$, where $\delta$ is the dead-zone width and $k$ is the slope outside the dead-zone. Although the function is "inactive" near the origin, its graph still lies between the lines of slope $0$ and slope $k$. Consequently, for any dead-zone width $\delta \ge 0$, the nonlinearity is contained within the sector $[0, k]$. This enables the direct application of the Popov criterion to certify stability for systems containing components with dead-zones [@problem_id:2689054].

#### Relay and Discontinuous Control

On-off controllers, or relays, represent a class of intentionally discontinuous nonlinearities. A simple relay may be modeled as $\phi(y) = M \mathrm{sgn}(y)$ for some amplitude $M0$. Such a function is passive, satisfying the condition $y\phi(y) \ge 0$ for all $y$. This corresponds to the limiting sector $[0, \infty)$. The circle and Popov criteria remain applicable in this unbounded case. For the sector $[0, \infty)$, the critical disk of the [circle criterion](@entry_id:173992) becomes the entire closed left half-plane. The stability condition thus simplifies to the requirement that the plant $G(s)$ be strictly positive real (SPR), meaning $\mathrm{Re}[G(j\omega)]  0$ for all $\omega$. The Popov criterion provides a less conservative condition, requiring the existence of a multiplier parameter $q \ge 0$ such that $\mathrm{Re}[(1+j\omega q)G(j\omega)]  0$. The key insight is that even for discontinuous nonlinearities, these rigorous stability tools are valid, provided the nonlinearity can be confined to a sector [@problem_id:2689032].

#### Smooth Nonlinearities

The framework is not limited to piecewise-linear or [discontinuous functions](@entry_id:139518). Smooth nonlinearities, such as the [sigmoid function](@entry_id:137244) $\phi(y) = M \tanh(ay)$ common in models of neural networks and biological processes, can also be analyzed. The slope of this function, $\phi(y)/y$, achieves its maximum value of $Ma$ at the origin and decreases as $|y|$ increases. Thus, the tightest global sector containing this nonlinearity is $[0, Ma]$. This allows for the analysis of systems with smooth, saturating characteristics using the same set of tools [@problem_id:2689009].

### Application Case Studies: Certifying Absolute Stability

Once a nonlinearity is characterized by a sector bound, the circle and Popov criteria can be applied to derive concrete stability guarantees.

#### Case Study: Circle Criterion for a Saturated System

Consider a stable second-order plant $G(s) = \frac{k}{(s+1)(s+2)}$ in a [negative feedback loop](@entry_id:145941) with a standard [saturation nonlinearity](@entry_id:271106), which belongs to the sector $[0, 1]$. Since the plant is stable, the [circle criterion](@entry_id:173992) for this sector requires that the Nyquist plot of $G(j\omega)$ remain strictly to the right of the vertical line at $\mathrm{Re}(z) = -1/1 = -1$. This condition, $\mathrm{Re}[G(j\omega)]  -1$ for all $\omega \ge 0$, can be solved analytically. By finding the frequency at which $\mathrm{Re}[G(j\omega)]$ reaches its minimum value, we can determine the supremum gain $k_{\max}$ for which the stability condition holds. For this specific plant, this analysis yields a precise upper bound on the gain $k$ that guarantees [absolute stability](@entry_id:165194) for any [actuator saturation](@entry_id:274581) level [@problem_id:2689029].

#### Case Study: Comparing Circle and Popov Criteria

The Popov criterion leverages the time-invariance of the nonlinearity to often provide less conservative results than the [circle criterion](@entry_id:173992). This can be illustrated clearly with an example. Consider a plant $G(s) = -1/4 + 1/((s+1)(s+2))$ in feedback with a sigmoid nonlinearity $\phi(y)=M\tanh(ay)$, which belongs to the sector $[0, Ma]$. Applying the [circle criterion](@entry_id:173992) yields a maximum certified sector width $k_{\mathrm{circ}}^{\star}$. Applying the Popov criterion, which involves optimizing over the multiplier parameter $q \ge 0$, yields a different maximum width, $k_{\mathrm{Popov}}^{\star}$. For this system, a detailed calculation reveals that $k_{\mathrm{Popov}}^{\star}  k_{\mathrm{circ}}^{\star}$. This demonstrates that by exploiting additional structural information—time-invariance—the Popov criterion can certify stability for a larger range of nonlinearities than the [circle criterion](@entry_id:173992), which only assumes sector-[boundedness](@entry_id:746948) [@problem_id:2689009].

### Extensions and Advanced Techniques

The fundamental principles of the circle and Popov criteria can be extended to handle a wider array of system configurations and problem types.

#### Loop Transformation for General Sectors

The criteria are most straightforwardly applied when the nonlinearity sector is of the form $[0, k]$ or $[k_1, k_2]$ with $k_1  0$. When the sector spans the origin, as in $[k_1, k_2]$ with $k_1  0  k_2$, a powerful technique known as **[loop transformation](@entry_id:751487)** is employed. The nonlinearity $\varphi(y)$ is rewritten as the sum of a linear term and a new nonlinearity: $\varphi(y) = k_1 y + \psi(y)$. The linear term $k_1 y$ is then algebraically absorbed into the linear part of the system. This results in an equivalent feedback loop between a new LTI plant, $G_t(s) = \frac{G(s)}{1+k_1G(s)}$, and the new nonlinearity $\psi(y)$, which now conveniently lies in the sector $[0, k_2 - k_1]$. The standard circle and Popov criteria can then be applied to this transformed system. This demonstrates the flexibility of the framework in accommodating more complex sector bounds [@problem_id:2689021].

#### Discrete-Time Systems

The theory of [absolute stability](@entry_id:165194) is not confined to [continuous-time systems](@entry_id:276553). Parallel criteria exist for [discrete-time systems](@entry_id:263935) described by transfer functions $G(z)$. In this context, the stability boundary is the unit circle, $z = e^{j\omega}$, instead of the [imaginary axis](@entry_id:262618).
- The **discrete-time [circle criterion](@entry_id:173992)** states that for a nonlinearity in the sector $[k_1, k_2]$, the [frequency response](@entry_id:183149) plot of $G(e^{j\omega})$ must avoid a critical disk defined by the points $-1/k_1$ and $-1/k_2$ on the real axis, with an additional encirclement condition if the plant is unstable. For a stable plant and a sector $[k_1, k_2]$ with $k_10$, the plot must remain outside this disk [@problem_id:2689017].
- Similarly, the **discrete-time Popov criterion** provides a less conservative test for nonlinearities in the sector $[0, k]$. It requires the existence of a real parameter $\alpha \ge 0$ such that for all $\omega \in [0, 2\pi)$, the following inequality holds: $\mathrm{Re}\left\{(1+\alpha e^{-j\omega})G(e^{j\omega})\right\}  -1/k$. These extensions ensure that the same rigorous analysis can be applied to [digital control systems](@entry_id:263415) [@problem_id:2689027].

### Interdisciplinary Connections and Broader Context

The circle and Popov criteria are deeply connected to several other major areas of control and [systems theory](@entry_id:265873), providing a bridge between classical and modern approaches.

#### Connection to Lyapunov Theory and Disturbance Rejection

The frequency-domain criteria have a profound connection to Lyapunov's second method. The Kalman-Yakubovich-Popov (KYP) lemma, which underpins these criteria, guarantees that if the frequency-domain inequality is satisfied, a quadratic Lyapunov function of the form $V(x) = x^T P x$ exists for the system state $x$. This Lyapunov function can be used for more than just proving stability. For instance, given a [first-order system](@entry_id:274311) with dynamics $\dot{x} = -2x - \varphi(x)$, where $\varphi$ is in the sector $[0,1]$, the [circle criterion](@entry_id:173992) is satisfied and the KYP lemma yields the Lyapunov function $V(x) = x^2$. If the system is now subjected to a bounded external disturbance $w(t)$ with $|w(t)| \le \bar{w}$, the derivative of the Lyapunov function becomes $\dot{V}(x) \le -4x^2 + 2|x|\bar{w}$. By analyzing the region where $\dot{V}(x) \le 0$, we can compute a positively [invariant set](@entry_id:276733)—a region of the state space from which trajectories cannot escape. This demonstrates how the principles of [absolute stability](@entry_id:165194) can be extended to analyze the robustness of a system to external disturbances and to estimate regions of attraction [@problem_id:2738236].

#### Connection to Robust Control and IQCs

Absolute stability analysis can be viewed as a precursor to modern robust control. The nonlinearity within a sector can be interpreted as a form of uncertainty. This perspective allows for powerful integrations.

- **Local Stability as a Robustness Problem:** For a smooth nonlinearity $\varphi(y)$ with derivative $k = \varphi'(0)$ at the origin, we can analyze [local stability](@entry_id:751408) by linearizing the system. The [linearization error](@entry_id:751298), $r(y) = \varphi(y) - ky$, can itself be bounded within a new sector, e.g., $[\alpha-k, \beta-k]$, based on the bounds $[\alpha, \beta]$ on the slope $\varphi'(y)$. The original nonlinear system is thus transformed into a feedback loop between a nominal linear system and a sector-bounded "uncertainty" $r(y)$. Absolute stability tools like the [circle criterion](@entry_id:173992) can then be applied to this new system to provide a rigorous guarantee of *local* stability, a significant improvement over simply checking the eigenvalues of the linearized system [@problem_id:2720570].

- **Robustness to Plant Uncertainty:** The geometric nature of the [circle criterion](@entry_id:173992) lends itself to analyzing systems with both nonlinearities and traditional LTI plant uncertainty. If a plant has a nominal transfer function $L(s)$ and a [multiplicative uncertainty](@entry_id:262202) $W(s)\Delta(s)$ with $\|\Delta\|_{\infty} \le 1$, the true [frequency response](@entry_id:183149) $L_{true}(j\omega)$ lies in a disk of radius $\|L(j\omega)W(j\omega)\|$ centered at the nominal point $L(j\omega)$. For robust [absolute stability](@entry_id:165194), this entire uncertainty disk must remain outside the critical circle for all frequencies. This translates to the condition that the distance from the nominal Nyquist plot to the critical circle must be greater than the radius of the uncertainty disk. This elegant geometric condition unifies the analysis of nonlinear and linear uncertainties [@problem_id:2689001].

- **Integral Quadratic Constraints (IQC):** The ideas of sector bounds and Popov multipliers are foundational concepts within the modern and more general framework of Integral Quadratic Constraints (IQC). An IQC is a constraint on the behavior of an uncertainty or nonlinearity, expressed as an integral of a quadratic form of the input and output signals. Sector bounds and the [monotonicity](@entry_id:143760) property exploited by the Popov criterion can both be formulated as IQCs. The IQC framework allows for the combination of multiple such constraints (e.g., a gain bound and a [monotonicity](@entry_id:143760) constraint) by taking conic combinations of their respective multipliers. This often yields a much more accurate description of the nonlinearity's behavior and, consequently, a significantly less conservative stability test. For example, for the plant $G(s)=2/(s+1)$, the standard small-gain (or [circle criterion](@entry_id:173992)) approach fails for nonlinearities with slope $k \ge 0.5$. However, because $G(s)$ is strictly positive real, the Popov criterion—a specific type of IQC analysis—proves stability for *any* slope $k0$, perfectly illustrating the power of exploiting additional structural information [@problem_id:2754148] [@problem_id:2720570].

#### Relationship with Other Stability Methods

Finally, it is instructive to place the circle and Popov criteria in the context of other stability analysis techniques.

- **Heuristic vs. Rigorous Analysis:** The describing function (DF) method is a popular heuristic for predicting the existence and characteristics of [limit cycles](@entry_id:274544). It approximates the nonlinearity with an amplitude-dependent gain. In contrast, the circle and Popov criteria provide rigorous mathematical proofs. If an [absolute stability](@entry_id:165194) criterion is satisfied for a given sector, it guarantees that no limit cycles can exist for any nonlinearity in that sector. Consequently, any limit cycle predicted by the DF method under these conditions must be an artifact of the method's underlying approximations [@problem_id:2699650].

- **General vs. Specialized Tools:** For [low-dimensional systems](@entry_id:145463), particularly planar (second-order) systems, classical tools like the Bendixson-Dulac theorem can sometimes provide stronger results. For instance, for a damped second-order system, the Bendixson-Dulac theorem might prove the absence of limit cycles for any sector-bounded nonlinearity, whereas the [circle criterion](@entry_id:173992) might only certify stability for a finite range of sector bounds. This highlights that while the circle and Popov criteria can be conservative, their immense power lies in their generality: they apply to LTI systems of *any* order, making them indispensable for the analysis of complex, high-dimensional engineering systems where specialized low-order methods are not applicable [@problem_id:2719205].

In summary, the circle and Popov criteria are not merely abstract theoretical constructs. They are practical, versatile, and foundational tools that enable engineers to reason rigorously about systems containing challenging nonlinear components. Their applications range from modeling and analysis of common actuators to the design of controllers robust to both nonlinear effects and plant uncertainty, and they serve as a conceptual gateway to the most advanced topics in modern control theory.
