In this region, $h(x)=2$. The sharpest possible analysis for the linear system corresponds to choosing $c$ and $d$ such that $\\gamma=2$. For example, completing the square for the linear case $\\dot{V}=-2x^2+xu$ gives $-2x^2+xu = -x^2 + \\frac{1}{4}u^2 - (x-\\frac{1}{2}u)^2 \\le -x^2+\\frac{1}{4}u^2$. This corresponds to $c=1, d=1/4$, for which $\\gamma=c+\\frac{1}{4d} = 1+\\frac{1}{4(1/4)}=2$.\n\nAdopting the value $\\gamma=2$ from the linearization, we now determine the largest radius $r$ for which this choice is valid for the nonlinear system. We must satisfy:\n$$\n2 \\le \\min_{0  |x| \\le r} h(x)\n$$\nWe evaluate the minimum of $h(x)$ over the domain $0  |x| \\le r$:\n- If $0  r \\le 1$: The function $h(x)$ is constant and equal to $2$ on this interval. So, $\\min_{0  |x| \\le r} h(x) = 2$. The condition is $2 \\le 2$, which is true. This confirms that any radius $r \\le 1$ is valid.\n- If $r  1$: The function $h(x)$ is equal to $2$ on $(0, 1]$ and decreases as $2/|x|$ on $(1, r]$. The minimum value on $(0, r]$ is attained at $|x|=r$, so $\\min_{0  |x| \\le r} h(x) = \\frac{2}{r}$. The condition becomes $2 \\le \\frac{2}{r}$, which simplifies to $r \\le 1$. This contradicts the assumption that $r  1$.\n\nTherefore, an ISS inequality with constants derived from a sharp analysis of the linearization can only be certified for a radius $r \\le 1$. The largest such radius is $r=1$.\n\n**Step 3: Counterexample to Global ISS**\n\nTo show the system is not globally ISS, we must provide a bounded input $u(t)$ that leads to an unbounded state trajectory $x(t)$.\nConsider an initial state $x(0)$ such that $x(0)  1$. For any $x  1$, the system dynamics are $\\dot{x} = -2\\,\\mathrm{sat}(x) + u = -2(1) + u = u-2$.\n\nLet us choose a constant input $u(t) = 3$ for all $t \\ge 0$. This input is bounded. Since $u=3  2$, the derivative is $\\dot{x} = 3-2 = 1$.\nIf we choose an initial condition in the region where this dynamic applies, for instance $x(0)=2$, the solution is:\n$$\nx(t) = x(0) + \\int_0^t 1 \\,d\\tau = 2+t\n$$\nAs $t \\to \\infty$, $x(t) \\to \\infty$. The state trajectory is unbounded, despite the input being bounded. This demonstrates that the system is not globally Input-to-State Stable.
