The givens are a scalar nonlinear system described by the ordinary differential equation $\\dot{x} = -x^{3}$ where the state is $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$. The equilibrium point under investigation is the origin, $x=0$. The task is to analyze stability using Lyapunov's indirect and direct methods, and then to compute a specific hitting time $T$ for a trajectory initialized at $x(0) = x_{0}$ to reach the closed ball $\\{x \\in \\mathbb{R}: |x| \\le r\\}$, given $|x_{0}| > r > 0$. The problem is scientifically grounded in control theory, is mathematically well-posed, internally consistent, and contains sufficient information for a unique solution. The problem is therefore deemed valid and a solution may proceed.\n\nFirst, we analyze the stability using Lyapunov's indirect method, also known as stability by linearization. The nonlinear system is given by $\\dot{x} = f(x)$, where the vector field is $f(x) = -x^{3}$. To linearize the system around the equilibrium point $x_e = 0$, we compute the Jacobian matrix of $f(x)$ evaluated at this point. In this scalar case, the Jacobian is the first derivative:\n$$\nJ(x) = \\frac{df}{dx} = \\frac{d}{dx}(-x^{3}) = -3x^{2}\n$$\nThe matrix $A$ of the linearized system $\\dot{\\delta x} = A \\delta x$ is obtained by evaluating the Jacobian at the equilibrium point $x_e=0$:\n$$\nA = J(0) = -3(0)^{2} = 0\n$$\nThe linearized system is therefore $\\dot{\\delta x} = 0$. The eigenvalue of the matrix $A$ is $\\lambda = 0$. Lyapunov's indirect method states that if the real part of any eigenvalue of the linearization matrix $A$ is zero, then the method is inconclusive. One cannot determine the stability properties (stability, asymptotic stability, or instability) of the nonlinear system's equilibrium point from its linearization. Thus, this first analysis fails to provide a conclusion.\n\nNext, we proceed with Lyapunov's direct method. We must construct a suitable Lyapunov candidate function $V(x)$. A standard choice, motivated by the concept of energy, is a quadratic function of the state. Let us propose the function:\n$$\nV(x) = \\frac{1}{2}x^{2}\n$$\nThis function must be checked for the required properties. It is continuously differentiable. It is positive definite, as $V(0) = 0$ and $V(x) > 0$ for all $x \\neq 0$. It is also radially unbounded, since $V(x) \\to \\infty$ as $|x| \\to \\infty$. Now, we compute the time derivative of $V(x)$ along the trajectories of the system $\\dot{x} = -x^{3}$:\n$$\n\\dot{V}(x) = \\frac{dV}{dt} = \\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial x} \\frac{dx}{dt} = \\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial x} \\dot{x}\n$$\nThe partial derivative is $\\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial x} = x$. Substituting this and the system dynamics, we find:\n$$\n\\dot{V}(x) = (x)(-x^{3}) = -x^{4}\n$$\nThe time derivative $\\dot{V}(x)$ is negative definite, because $\\dot{V}(0) = 0$ and $\\dot{V}(x)  0$ for all $x \\neq 0$. Since we have found a positive definite, radially unbounded Lyapunov function $V(x)$ for which its time derivative $\\dot{V}(x)$ is negative definite, we can conclude that the equilibrium point $x=0$ is globally asymptotically stable.\n\nThe problem requires a differential equation in terms of the Lyapunov function $V$ alone. We have the relations $V = \\frac{1}{2}x^{2}$ and $\\dot{V} = -x^{4}$. From the first relation, we can write $x^{2} = 2V$. Substituting this into the expression for $\\dot{V}$, we obtain:\n$$\n\\dot{V} = -(x^{2})^{2} = -(2V)^{2} = -4V^{2}\n$$\nThis is the required scalar differential equation for $V(t)$.\n\nFinally, we must quantify the convergence time $T$. We are asked to find the time it takes for a trajectory starting at $x(0) = x_{0}$ to enter the set $|x| \\le r$, where it is given that $|x_{0}| > r > 0$. The initial condition for the Lyapunov function is $V(0) = V_{0} = \\frac{1}{2}x_{0}^{2}$. The trajectory enters the specified region at time $T$, at which point $|x(T)| = r$. The value of the Lyapunov function at this time is $V(T) = V_{r} = \\frac{1}{2}r^{2}$. We solve the differential equation $\\frac{dV}{dt} = -4V^{2}$ by separation of variables:\n$$\n\\frac{dV}{V^{2}} = -4 dt\n$$\nWe integrate this equation from the initial time $t=0$ to the final time $t=T$:\n$$\n\\int_{V_{0}}^{V_{r}} V^{-2} dV = \\int_{0}^{T} -4 dt\n$$\nPerforming the integration yields:\n$$\n\\left[ -V^{-1} \\right]_{V_{0}}^{V_{r}} = \\left[ -4t \\right]_{0}^{T}\n$$\n$$\n-\\frac{1}{V_{r}} - \\left(-\\frac{1}{V_{0}}\\right) = -4T - 0\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{1}{V_{0}} - \\frac{1}{V_{r}} = -4T\n$$\nSolving for the hitting time $T$:\n$$\nT = \\frac{1}{4} \\left( \\frac{1}{V_{r}} - \\frac{1}{V_{0}} \\right)\n$$\nNow, substitute the expressions for $V_{r}$ and $V_{0}$ in terms of $r$ and $x_{0}$:\n$$\nT = \\frac{1}{4} \\left( \\frac{1}{\\frac{1}{2}r^{2}} - \\frac{1}{\\frac{1}{2}x_{0}^{2}} \\right)\n$$\n$$\nT = \\frac{1}{4} \\left( \\frac{2}{r^{2}} - \\frac{2}{x_{0}^{2}} \\right)\n$$\nSimplifying this expression gives the final analytical result for the hitting time:\n$$\nT = \\frac{1}{2} \\left( \\frac{1}{r^{2}} - \\frac{1}{x_{0}^{2}} \\right)\n$$\nThis is the exact time required for the state to travel from an initial value $x_{0}$ to the boundary of the region defined by $|x| \\le r$.

This is equivalent to finding the largest $\\rho^{\\star}$ such that the sublevel set $\\Omega_{\\rho^{\\star}} = \\{x \\in \\mathbb{R}^2 : V(x) \\le \\rho^{\\star}\\}$ is contained entirely within the region where $\\dot{V}(x) \\le 0$.\n\nLet us analyze the condition $\\dot{V}(x) \\le 0$:\n$$\n-x_1^2 - x_2^2 + \\frac{1}{2}x_1^3 \\le 0\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{1}{2}x_1^3 \\le x_1^2 + x_2^2\n$$\nThis inequality can be rewritten as:\n$$\n-x_1^2(1 - \\frac{1}{2}x_1) - x_2^2 \\le 0\n$$\nWe examine the term $(1 - \\frac{1}{2}x_1)$.\nIf $x_1 \\le 2$, then $1 - \\frac{1}{2}x_1 \\ge 0$. In this case, $-x_1^2(1 - \\frac{1}{2}x_1) \\le 0$. Since $-x_2^2 \\le 0$, their sum is always less than or equal to zero.\nTherefore, the condition $\\dot{V}(x) \\le 0$ is satisfied for all $x$ such that $x_1 \\le 2$.\n\nThe problem now reduces to finding the largest $\\rho^{\\star} > 0$ for which the sublevel set (an ellipse) $\\Omega_{\\rho^{\\star}} = \\{x : \\frac{1}{4}x_1^2 + \\frac{1}{2}x_2^2 \\le \\rho^{\\star}\\}$ is contained in the half-plane $\\{x : x_1 \\le 2\\}$. For this inclusion to hold, the maximum value of $x_1$ within the set $\\Omega_{\\rho^{\\star}}$ must be less than or equal to $2$.\n\nThe boundary of the sublevel set is the ellipse $\\frac{1}{4}x_1^2 + \\frac{1}{2}x_2^2 = \\rho^{\\star}$. The maximum value of $x_1$ on this ellipse occurs when $x_2=0$. Substituting $x_2=0$ into the equation of the ellipse, we find:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{4}x_1^2 = \\rho^{\\star} \\implies x_1^2 = 4\\rho^{\\star} \\implies x_1 = \\pm 2\\sqrt{\\rho^{\\star}}\n$$\nThe maximum value of $x_1$ is $x_{1,\\text{max}} = 2\\sqrt{\\rho^{\\star}}$.\nWe enforce the constraint $x_{1,\\text{max}} \\le 2$:\n$$\n2\\sqrt{\\rho^{\\star}} \\le 2 \\implies \\sqrt{\\rho^{\\star}} \\le 1\n$$\nSince $\\rho^{\\star} > 0$, this implies $\\rho^{\\star} \\le 1$.\nThe largest value of $\\rho^{\\star}$ satisfying this condition is $\\rho^{\\star} = 1$.\n\nFor $\\rho^{\\star}=1$, every point $x \\in \\Omega_1$ satisfies $V(x) \\le 1$, which implies $\\frac{1}{4}x_1^2 \\le \\frac{1}{4}x_1^2 + \\frac{1}{2}x_2^2 \\le 1$, so $x_1^2 \\le 4$, or $-2 \\le x_1 \\le 2$. As established, for any $x_1$ in this range, $\\dot{V}(x) \\le 0$. Thus, $\\Omega_1$ is an invariant set and an estimate of the domain of attraction. The largest such scalar is $\\rho^{\\star} = 1$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{1}$$", "id": "2721953"}]}
