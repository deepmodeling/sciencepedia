We shall proceed with its solution.\n\nThe objective is to analyze the behavior of a second-order system under a sliding mode control law. This involves two main tasks: first, deriving the reaching condition dynamics, and second, analyzing the stability of the system on the sliding manifold.\n\nThe system is described by the state equations:\n$$\n\\dot{x}_{1} = x_{2}\n$$\n$$\n\\dot{x}_{2} = -\\lambda x_{2} + u\n$$\nwhere $\\lambda  0$ is a physical damping constant. The sliding variable is defined as a linear combination of the states:\n$$\ns = \\lambda x_{1} + x_{2}\n$$\nThe control input is a discontinuous function of the sliding variable:\n$$\nu = -k \\mathrm{sign}(s)\n$$\nwhere the gain $k  0$.\n\nFirst, we compute the time derivative of the sliding variable, $\\dot{s}$.

Next, we substitute the specified control law $u = -k \\mathrm{sign}(s)$ into the expression for $\\dot{s}$:\n$$\n\\dot{s} = -k \\mathrm{sign}(s)\n$$\nThis first-order differential equation describes the dynamics of the system state approaching the sliding manifold $s=0$. This is the reaching phase dynamics.\n\nTo analyze the stability of the reaching phase, we use a Lyapunov-like approach by examining the product $s\\dot{s}$. This product must be strictly negative for any state not on the sliding manifold (i.e., for $s \\neq 0$) to guarantee that the state trajectory is always directed towards the manifold.\nWe form the product:\n$$\ns\\dot{s} = s(-k \\mathrm{sign}(s)) = -k (s \\cdot \\mathrm{sign}(s))\n$$\nWe use the fundamental property of the sign function, which states that for any real number $z$, the product $z \\cdot \\mathrm{sign}(z)$ is equal to the absolute value $|z|$. Applying this property to our expression with $z=s$, we obtain:\n$$\ns\\dot{s} = -k|s|\n$$\nThis is the required explicit expression for $s\\dot{s}$.\n\nNow, we determine the conditions that ensure $s\\dot{s}  0$ for all $s \\neq 0$. The expression is $s\\dot{s} = -k|s|$. For any $s \\neq 0$, the absolute value $|s|$ is strictly positive. The problem specifies that the control gain $k$ is also a positive constant, $k  0$. Therefore, the product $-k|s|$ is the product of a strictly negative number ($-k$) and a strictly positive number ($|s|$), which is always strictly negative.\n$$\ns\\dot{s} = -k|s|  0 \\quad \\text{for all } s \\neq 0\n$$\nThe condition required to ensure this inequality is $k  0$. This condition is satisfied by the problem's premise.\n\nNext, we analyze the reduced-order dynamics on the sliding manifold, which is defined by the condition $s=0$. On this manifold, the states are constrained by the relation:\n$$\ns = \\lambda x_{1} + x_{2} = 0 \\quad \\implies \\quad x_{2} = -\\lambda x_{1}\n$$\nThe dynamics of the system, when confined to this manifold, are referred to as the sliding dynamics. To find these dynamics, we substitute the constraint into the system's state equations. We use the first state equation:\n$$\n\\dot{x}_{1} = x_{2}\n$$\nSubstituting $x_{2} = -\\lambda x_{1}$ into this equation gives the reduced-order dynamics in terms of the state $x_{1}$:\n$$\n\\dot{x}_{1} = -\\lambda x_{1}\n$$\nThis is a standard first-order linear time-invariant system. For such a system to be asymptotically stable, its pole must be in the open left-half of the complex plane. The pole of this system is $-\\lambda$. Thus, the condition for asymptotic stability is:\n$$\n-\\lambda  0 \\quad \\implies \\quad \\lambda  0\n$$\nThis condition is also satisfied by the problem's premise, which states that $\\lambda$ is a positive physical constant.\n\nIn summary, the condition for the reaching phase to be stable is $k  0$, and the condition for the sliding phase to be asymptotically stable is $\\lambda  0$.
