It describes a canonical double integrator system, which is a fundamental model in control theory. All definitions and equations are standard and consistent. The requirement to solve from first principles is a valid pedagogical constraint. Therefore, the problem is valid, and we may proceed with the solution.\n\nThe system can be written in the standard control-affine form $\\dot{x} = f(x) + g(x)u$ with output $y = h(x)$.\nBy inspection of the given equations, we identify the components:\nThe state vector is $x = \\begin{pmatrix} x_1 \\\\ x_2 \\end{pmatrix}$.\nThe drift vector field is $f(x) = \\begin{pmatrix} x_2 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}$.\nThe control vector field is $g(x) = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}$.\nThe output function is $h(x) = x_1$.\n\nThe relative degree, denoted by $r$, is defined as the smallest positive integer for which the input $u$ appears when differentiating the output $y$ successively with respect to time. Formally, it is the smallest integer $r$ such that $L_g L_f^{r-1} h(x) \\neq 0$ for all $x$ in a domain of interest, where $L_f h(x)$ is the Lie derivative of the scalar field $h$ along the vector field $f$.\n\nThe Lie derivative of a scalar function $\\phi(x)$ along a vector field $v(x)$ is given by $L_v \\phi(x) = \\frac{\\partial \\phi}{\\partial x} v(x)$.\n\nWe now differentiate the output $y$ with respect to time along the system's trajectories:\n$$\n\\dot{y} = \\frac{d}{dt} h(x(t)) = \\frac{\\partial h}{\\partial x} \\dot{x} = \\frac{\\partial h}{\\partial x} (f(x) + g(x)u) = L_f h(x) + L_g h(x) u\n$$\nLet us compute the terms $L_f h(x)$ and $L_g h(x)$.\nThe Jacobian of $h(x)$ is $\\frac{\\partial h}{\\partial x} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1  0 \\end{pmatrix}$.\n\nWe first check the term multiplying the input $u$, which is $L_g h(x)$:\n$$\nL_g h(x) = \\frac{\\partial h}{\\partial x} g(x) = \\begin{pmatrix} 1  0 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix} = 1 \\cdot 0 + 0 \\cdot 1 = 0\n$$\nSince $L_g h(x) = 0$, the input $u$ does not appear in the first derivative of the output. The relative degree must be greater than $1$. The first derivative is:\n$$\n\\dot{y} = L_f h(x) = \\frac{\\partial h}{\\partial x} f(x) = \\begin{pmatrix} 1  0 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} x_2 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix} = 1 \\cdot x_2 + 0 \\cdot 0 = x_2\n$$\n\nWe must now differentiate the output a second time:\n$$\n\\ddot{y} = \\frac{d}{dt} (\\dot{y}) = \\frac{d}{dt} (L_f h(x))\n$$\nSince $\\dot{y}$ is a function of state, we apply the chain rule again:\n$$\n\\ddot{y} = \\frac{\\partial (L_f h(x))}{\\partial x} \\dot{x} = \\frac{\\partial (L_f h(x))}{\\partial x} (f(x) + g(x)u) = L_f(L_f h(x)) + L_g(L_f h(x)) u\n$$\nThis expression is commonly written as $\\ddot{y} = L_f^2 h(x) + L_g L_f h(x) u$.\n\nTo determine if the input $u$ appears, we must compute the term $L_g L_f h(x)$. We have already found that $L_f h(x) = x_2$. Let us define a new scalar function $\\phi(x) = L_f h(x) = x_2$. The Jacobian of this new function is $\\frac{\\partial \\phi}{\\partial x} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0  1 \\end{pmatrix}$.\nNow we compute its Lie derivative along $g(x)$:\n$$\nL_g L_f h(x) = L_g \\phi(x) = \\frac{\\partial \\phi}{\\partial x} g(x) = \\begin{pmatrix} 0  1 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix} = 0 \\cdot 0 + 1 \\cdot 1 = 1\n$$\nSince $L_g L_f h(x) = 1$, which is non-zero for any state $x \\in \\mathbb{R}^2$, the input $u$ appears explicitly in the second time derivative of the output. The smallest integer for which this occurs is $r=2$. Therefore, the relative degree of the system is $2$ everywhere in the state space.\n\nThe expression for the second derivative of the output is:\n$$\n\\ddot{y} = L_f^2 h(x) + L_g L_f h(x) u = L_f(x_2) + 1 \\cdot u\n$$\nTo complete this, $L_f(x_2) = \\frac{\\partial(x_2)}{\\partial x} f(x) = \\begin{pmatrix} 0  1 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} x_2 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix} = 0$.\nThus, we find $\\ddot{y} = u$, which is consistent with the initial state equations, as $\\ddot{y} = \\frac{d}{dt}(\\dot{y}) = \\frac{d}{dt}(x_2) = \\dot{x}_2 = u$.\n\nImplications of the relative degree $r=2$:\n1. The value $r=2$ signifies that the output $y$ must be differentiated exactly two times along the system's trajectories before the control input $u$ exerts an explicit, instantaneous influence. The effect of the input is \"delayed\" by two integrators from the standpoint of the output.\n2. The relative degree $r=2$ is equal to the dimension of the state space, $n=2$. When $r = n$, the system is said to possess no zero dynamics, or its zero dynamics are trivial. Zero dynamics represent the internal behavior of the system when the output is constrained to be zero for all time, i.e., $y(t) \\equiv 0$. For this system, $y(t) = x_1(t) \\equiv 0$. Differentiating, we get $\\dot{y}(t) = \\dot{x}_1(t) = x_2(t) \\equiv 0$. Thus, constraining the output to zero forces the entire state vector $x$ to be the zero vector. The dynamics that remain under this constraint are simply $\\dot{x}=0$, which are trivial. The absence of non-trivial zero dynamics implies that the system is fully linearizable via state feedback and a coordinate transformation, and there is no hidden or unobservable internal state evolution when controlling the output.\n\nThe relative degree is $2$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{2}$$", "id": "2739636"}, {"introduction": "Moving from an abstract model to a physical one, this practice applies the concept of relative degree to the dynamics of a damped pendulum.

For $k=1$, $L_g h(x_0) = 0$.\n2.  For $k=2$, $L_g L_f h(x_0) = 2x_{1,0} = 0$.\n3.  For $r=3$, $L_g L_f^{3-1} h(x_0) = L_g L_f^2 h(x_0) = 4x_{2,0} \\neq 0$.\nTherefore, at any point $x_0$ where $x_{1,0}=0$ and $x_{2,0} \\neq 0$, the relative degree is $r=3$.\n\nExplanation of the Difference and Analysis at $x_0=(0,0)$:\nThe relative degree of a nonlinear system is not necessarily a global property; it can be state-dependent. The reason for the change in relative degree from $r=2$ to $r=3$ resides in the nonlinear output function $y=x_1^2$. The expression $L_g L_f h(x) = 2x_1$ can be interpreted as the \"gain\" through which the input $u$ affects the second derivative of the output. When $x_1 \\neq 0$, this pathway is open, and the effect of control is felt at the second derivative level ($r=2$). When $x_1=0$, this pathway is blocked. Such a point is a singularity for the input-output relationship. At this singularity, we must investigate higher-order derivatives to find the first connection between input and output. The next pathway is governed by $L_g L_f^2 h(x) = 4x_2$. If $x_2 \\neq 0$ (while $x_1=0$), this new pathway is open, and the effect of control is first felt at the third derivative level ($r=3$).\n\nAt the equilibrium point of the unforced system, $x_0=(0,0)$, we have both $x_{1,0}=0$ and $x_{2,0}=0$. Let us evaluate the coefficients at this point:\n$$\nL_g L_f h(0,0) = 2x_{1,0} = 0\n$$\n$$\nL_g L_f^2 h(0,0) = 4x_{2,0} = 0\n$$\nBoth coefficients are zero. To check if a finite relative degree exists, one must continue differentiating. A systematic calculation shows that $L_g L_f^{k-1} h(x)$ will always be a linear combination of $x_1$ and $x_2$. For instance, $L_g L_f^3 h(x) = -8x_1$ and $L_g L_f^4 h(x) = -16x_2$. Consequently, at the point $x_0=(0,0)$, we have $L_g L_f^{k-1} h(0,0) = 0$ for all integers $k \\ge 1$. This means no finite integer $r$ satisfies the definition of relative degree. Therefore, at the equilibrium point $x_0=(0,0)$, the relative degree is undefined or, more commonly, said to be infinite.\n\nThe final results for the specified regions are $r=2$ for $x_{1,0} \\neq 0$ and $r=3$ for $x_{1,0}=0, x_{2,0} \\neq 0$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n2  3\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "2739602"}]}
