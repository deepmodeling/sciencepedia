It is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and contains all necessary information for its resolution. I will proceed with the solution.\n\nThe problem requires the completion of two tasks. First, the construction of the explicit solution to the given transport equation. Second, the application of the lifting method to transform the problem with an inhomogeneous boundary condition into one with a homogeneous boundary condition and an in-domain source.\n\n**Task 1: Explicit Solution via Method of Characteristics**\n\nThe governing partial differential equation is the one-dimensional linear transport equation:\n$$\nu_{t}(x,t) + u_{x}(x,t) = 0, \\quad x \\in (0,1), t0.\n$$\nThis equation states that the directional derivative of the solution $u(x,t)$ along the vector $(1,1)$ in the $(t,x)$-plane is zero. This implies that the solution $u$ is constant along the characteristic curves defined by $\\frac{dx}{dt} = 1$. The solutions to this ordinary differential equation are the family of parallel lines $x-t = C$, where $C$ is a constant.\n\nConsequently, the general solution of the PDE is of the form $u(x,t) = F(x-t)$ for some function $F$. The specific form of $F$ is determined by the initial and boundary conditions. To find the value of $u$ at a point $(x,t)$ in the domain $x \\in (0,1), t0$, we must trace the characteristic line $x'-t' = x-t$ back to where it intersects the boundary of the domain, which consists of the initial line $\\{ (x',0) | x' \\in (0,1) \\}$ and the inflow boundary $\\{ (0,t') | t'  0 \\}$.\n\nCase 1: The characteristic intersects the initial line.\nThis occurs if the point $(x-t, 0)$ lies on the initial line segment, which requires $0  x-t  1$. Given $x \\in (0,1)$ and $t0$, this corresponds to the region defined by $t  x  1$. In this region, the solution value is determined by the initial condition $u_0(x)$:\n$$\nu(x,t) = u(x-t, 0) = u_0(x-t).\n$$\n\nCase 2: The characteristic intersects the inflow boundary.\nThis occurs if the point $(0, t-x)$ lies on the inflow boundary, which requires $t-x  0$, or $x  t$. Given $x \\in (0,1)$ and $t0$, this corresponds to the region $0  x  t$. In this region, the solution value is determined by the boundary condition $g(t)$:\n$$\nu(x,t) = u(0, t-x) = g(t-x).\n$$\n\nWe can combine these two cases using the indicator function $\\mathbf{1}_{E}(y)$, which is $1$ if $y \\in E$ and $0$ otherwise. For any point $(x,t)$ with $x \\in (0,1)$ and $t0$, one of two conditions, $xt$ or $xt$, will hold (we neglect the line $x=t$ of measure zero).\nThe condition $t  x  1$ is equivalent to $x \\in (t,1)$.\nThe condition $0  x  t$ is equivalent to $x \\in (0,t)$.\nNote that if $t \\ge 1$, the interval $(t,1)$ is empty, so $\\mathbf{1}_{(t,1)}(x) = 0$ for all $x \\in (0,1)$. In this scenario, $x  t$ for all $x \\in (0,1)$, and the solution is determined entirely by the boundary data $g$. The expression remains correct.\n\nTherefore, the explicit closed-form solution is:\n$$\nu(x,t) = u_0(x-t) \\mathbf{1}_{(t,1)}(x) + g(t-x) \\mathbf{1}_{(0,t)}(x).\n$$\nThis expression is the complete solution in terms of the initial data $u_0$ and boundary data $g$. The problem refers to this as the \"semigroup solution,\" which is appropriate as this form can be derived from the Duhamel's principle applied to the abstract evolution equation with boundary control, although the method of characteristics provides the most direct path to this explicit formula.\n\n**Task 2: Lifting Method**\n\nThe second task is to find a lifting profile $\\ell(x)$ and a source term $q(x,t)$ for the transformed variable $z(x,t) = u(x,t) - \\ell(x)g(t)$. The purpose of this transformation is to obtain an equivalent system for $z(x,t)$ that has a homogeneous boundary condition at $x=0$.\n\nFirst, we impose the condition $z(0,t)=0$. Substituting the definition of $z(x,t)$ and the given boundary condition $u(0,t)=g(t)$:\n$$\nz(0,t) = u(0,t) - \\ell(0)g(t) = g(t) - \\ell(0)g(t) = (1 - \\ell(0))g(t).\n$$\nFor $z(0,t)$ to be zero for any locally absolutely continuous function $g(t)$, we must enforce the condition on the profile $\\ell(x)$:\n$$\n\\ell(0) = 1.\n$$\nNext, we derive the PDE for $z(x,t)$. We compute the partial derivatives of $u(x,t) = z(x,t) + \\ell(x)g(t)$:\n$$\nu_t(x,t) = z_t(x,t) + \\ell(x)g'(t),\n$$\n$$\nu_x(x,t) = z_x(x,t) + \\ell'(x)g(t).\n$$\nSubstituting these into the original PDE $u_t+u_x=0$:\n$$\n(z_t(x,t) + \\ell(x)g'(t)) + (z_x(x,t) + \\ell'(x)g(t)) = 0.\n$$\nRearranging the terms, we obtain the PDE for $z(x,t)$:\n$$\nz_t(x,t) + z_x(x,t) = -\\ell'(x)g(t) - \\ell(x)g'(t).\n$$\nThe right-hand side is the equivalent in-domain source term, which the problem denotes as $q(x,t)$:\n$$\nq(x,t) = -\\ell'(x)g(t) - \\ell(x)g'(t).\n$$\nThe problem asks for an explicit spatial profile $\\ell(x)$. We have the condition $\\ell(0)=1$. There are infinitely many functions in $H^1(0,1)$ that satisfy this. A guiding principle in such problems is to select the simplest possible function that satisfies the requirements, so as not to introduce unnecessary complexity into the resulting equation.\n\nThe simplest non-trivial choice is a constant function. Let us set $\\ell(x) = 1$ for all $x \\in (0,1)$.\nThis function clearly satisfies $\\ell(0)=1$ and is in $H^1(0,1)$ (in fact, it is in $C^\\infty[0,1]$). Its derivative is $\\ell'(x) = 0$.\n\nWith this choice, the source term $q(x,t)$ simplifies significantly:\n$$\nq(x,t) = -(0)g(t) - (1)g'(t) = -g'(t).\n$$\nThe existence of $g'(t)$ as a locally square-integrable function is guaranteed by the given condition $g \\in H^1_{\\mathrm{loc}}([0,\\infty))$. This choice of $\\ell(x)=1$ results in a source term that is spatially uniform, which is a considerable simplification for further analysis. This is the canonical choice for this type of problem.\n\nIn summary:\n1. The explicit solution is $u(x,t) = u_0(x-t) \\mathbf{1}_{(t,1)}(x) + g(t-x) \\mathbf{1}_{(0,t)}(x)$.\n2. The lifting profile is $\\ell(x) = 1$.\n3.

It is impossible to find a finite constant $\\kappa_{\\infty}$ that satisfies this inequality.\nAs a concrete counterexample, consider the initial state $x_{0} = (\\sin(x), 0)$.

Admissibility in this sense is intrinsically linked to energy dissipation, which is absent in this system.\n\nFinally, we compute the exact minimal finite-time admissibility constant $\\kappa(\\tau)$. By definition, $\\kappa(\\tau)$ is the smallest constant for which the following inequality holds for all $x_{0} \\in H$:\n$$\n\\int_{0}^{\\tau} \\|C\\,T(t) x_{0}\\|_{Y}^{2}\\,dt \\le \\kappa(\\tau)\\, \\|x_{0}\\|_{H}^{2}.\n$$\nThis is equivalent to finding the squared norm of the operator $\\mathcal{G}_{\\tau}: H \\to L^{2}(0,\\tau; Y)$ defined by $(\\mathcal{G}_{\\tau}x_{0})(t) = C T(t) x_{0}$. The squared norm is\n$$\n\\kappa(\\tau) = \\sup_{\\substack{x_{0} \\in H \\\\ \\|x_{0}\\|_{H}=1}} \\int_{0}^{\\tau} \\|C\\,T(t) x_{0}\\|_{Y}^{2}\\,dt.\n$$\nSubstituting $C=I_{H}$ and $Y=H$:\n$$\n\\kappa(\\tau) = \\sup_{\\substack{x_{0} \\in H \\\\ \\|x_{0}\\|_{H}=1}} \\int_{0}^{\\tau} \\|T(t) x_{0}\\|_{H}^{2}\\,dt.\n$$\nUsing the established isometry property $\\|T(t)x_{0}\\|_{H}^{2} = \\|x_{0}\\|_{H}^{2}$:\n$$\n\\kappa(\\tau) = \\sup_{\\substack{x_{0} \\in H \\\\ \\|x_{0}\\|_{H}=1}} \\int_{0}^{\\tau} \\|x_{0}\\|_{H}^{2}\\,dt.\n$$\nFor any $x_{0}$ on the unit sphere of $H$, we have $\\|x_{0}\\|_{H}^{2}=1$. The expression becomes\n$$\n\\kappa(\\tau) = \\int_{0}^{\\tau} 1\\,dt.\n$$\nEvaluating this elementary integral gives\n$$\n\\kappa(\\tau) = \\tau.\n$$\nThis relation holds for any non-zero initial state $x_{0}$, meaning the supremum is attained for all $x_{0} \\in H \\setminus \\{0\\}$. The minimal constant $\\kappa(\\tau)$ is therefore precisely $\\tau$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\tau}\n$$", "id": "2695936"}]}
