The task is to determine the initial response of this model to a step strain, a classic problem in materials mechanics. All terms ($E_1$, $E_2$, $\\eta$, SLS model, Heaviside function, Dirac delta) are standard and well-defined. The constitutive laws are correct. The stated physical constraints, particularly the continuity of dashpot deformation to avoid infinite stress, are physically sound and essential for obtaining a unique, well-posed solution. The problem is scientifically grounded, self-contained, well-posed, and objective. It is a standard exercise in applying first principles of mechanics to a composite material model.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem statement is valid. I will proceed with the derivation of the solution.\n\n### Derivation\nThe model consists of two branches in parallel. The total strain $\\epsilon(t)$ is applied to both branches.\nBranch 1: Maxwell element (spring $E_{1}$ in series with dashpot $\\eta$).\nBranch 2: Spring with modulus $E_{2}$.\n\nThe applied strain is a step function: $\\epsilon(t) = \\epsilon_{0}H(t)$.\nAt any time $t0$, the strain is constant: $\\epsilon(t) = \\epsilon_{0}$. Thus, for $t=0^{+}$, we have $\\epsilon(0^{+}) = \\epsilon_{0}$.\n\nLet us analyze the state of the system at the instant $t=0^{+}$.\n\n**Analysis of the Parallel Spring ($E_{2}$)**\nThe strain in this spring is equal to the total strain, $\\epsilon_{E_{2}}(t) = \\epsilon(t)$.\nAt $t=0^{+}$, the strain is $\\epsilon_{E_{2}}(0^{+}) = \\epsilon(0^{+}) = \\epsilon_{0}$.\nThe stress in this spring is given by the constitutive relation $\\sigma_{E_{2}}(t) = E_{2}\\,\\epsilon_{E_{2}}(t)$.\nTherefore, at $t=0^{+}$, the stress is $\\sigma_{E_{2}}(0^{+}) = E_{2}\\epsilon_{0}$.\n\n**Analysis of the Maxwell Branch**\nThe strain in the Maxwell branch is also equal to the total strain, $\\epsilon_{M}(t) = \\epsilon(t)$. At $t=0^{+}$, $\\epsilon_{M}(0^{+}) = \\epsilon_{0}$.\nThis branch consists of a spring ($E_{1}$) and a dashpot ($\\eta$) in series. The strains are additive:\n$$ \\epsilon_{M}(t) = \\epsilon_{s}(t) + \\epsilon_{d}(t) $$\nAt $t=0^{+}$, this means $\\epsilon_{0} = \\epsilon_{s}(0^{+}) + \\epsilon_{d}(0^{+})$.\n\nThe crucial element is the dashpot. Its constitutive law is $\\sigma_{d}(t) = \\eta \\dot{\\epsilon}_{d}(t)$, where $\\dot{\\epsilon}_{d}(t) = \\frac{d\\epsilon_{d}}{dt}$.\nThe problem specifies that there can be no impulsive (Dirac delta) stress. An instantaneous jump in the dashpot strain $\\epsilon_{d}(t)$ from $\\epsilon_{d}(0^{-})=0$ to a non-zero value $\\epsilon_{d}(0^{+})$ would imply that the strain rate $\\dot{\\epsilon}_{d}(t)$ contains a Dirac delta term, specifically $\\dot{\\epsilon}_{d}(t) = \\epsilon_{d}(0^{+})\\delta(t) + \\dots$. This would produce an impulsive stress $\\sigma_{d}(t) = \\eta \\epsilon_{d}(0^{+})\\delta(t) + \\dots$, which is forbidden by the problem's physical admissibility conditions.\n\nTherefore, the strain in the dashpot must be a continuous function of time at $t=0$.\nGiven that the bar is unstrained for $t0$, we have $\\epsilon_{d}(0^{-}) = 0$.\nBy continuity, the strain in the dashpot at $t=0^{+}$ must be:\n$$ \\epsilon_{d}(0^{+}) = 0 $$\nThis is a key result. A dashpot behaves as a rigid link under an instantaneous application of strain.\n\nNow we can determine the strain in the Maxwell spring. From the additive strain relation:\n$$ \\epsilon_{s}(0^{+}) = \\epsilon_{0} - \\epsilon_{d}(0^{+}) = \\epsilon_{0} - 0 = \\epsilon_{0} $$\nSo, at $t=0^{+}$, the entire strain in the Maxwell branch is taken up by the spring.\n\nThe stress in the Maxwell branch, $\\sigma_{M}(t)$, is the same for both the spring and the dashpot in series: $\\sigma_{M}(t) = \\sigma_{s}(t) = \\sigma_{d}(t)$.\nAt $t=0^{+}$, we can calculate this stress from the spring $E_{1}$:\n$$ \\sigma_{M}(0^{+}) = \\sigma_{s}(0^{+}) = E_{1}\\epsilon_{s}(0^{+}) = E_{1}\\epsilon_{0} $$\nThis stress is finite, which is consistent with the initial assumptions.\n\nNow, let us find the total stress on the bar at $t=0^{+}$. The total stress is the sum of stresses in the parallel branches:\n$$ \\sigma(t) = \\sigma_{M}(t) + \\sigma_{E_{2}}(t) $$\nAt $t=0^{+}$, we have:\n$$ \\sigma(0^{+}) = \\sigma_{M}(0^{+}) + \\sigma_{E_{2}}(0^{+}) = E_{1}\\epsilon_{0} + E_{2}\\epsilon_{0} = (E_{1}+E_{2})\\epsilon_{0} $$\nThe instantaneous modulus of the SLS model is therefore $E_{\\text{inst}} = E_{1}+E_{2}$.\n\nFinally, let us check for consistency with the dashpot constitutive law at $t=0^{+}$. We have $\\sigma_{d}(0^{+}) = \\sigma_{M}(0^{+}) = E_{1}\\epsilon_{0}$.\nFrom $\\sigma_{d}(t) = \\eta \\dot{\\epsilon}_{d}(t)$, we can determine the initial rate of strain in the dashpot:\n$$ \\dot{\\epsilon}_{d}(0^{+}) = \\frac{\\sigma_{d}(0^{+})}{\\eta} = \\frac{E_{1}\\epsilon_{0}}{\\eta} $$\nThis is a finite, well-defined value. It represents the rate at which the dashpot starts to deform immediately after the load is applied, allowing the stress in the Maxwell arm to relax over time. All conditions are internally consistent.\n\nSummary of initial conditions at $t=0^{+}$:\n- $\\epsilon_{d}(0^{+}) = 0$\n- $\\epsilon_{s}(0^{+}) = \\epsilon_{0}$\n- $\\sigma_{M}(0^{+}) = E_{1}\\epsilon_{0}$\n- $\\sigma(0^{+}) = (E_{1}+E_{2})\\epsilon_{0}$\n- $\\dot{\\epsilon}_{d}(0^{+}) = E_{1}\\epsilon_{0}/\\eta$\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. $\\epsilon_{s}(0^{+})=\\epsilon_{0}$, $\\epsilon_{d}(0^{+})=0$, $\\sigma_{M}(0^{+})=E_{1}\\,\\epsilon_{0}$, $\\sigma(0^{+})=(E_{1}+E_{2})\\,\\epsilon_{0}$, and $\\dot{\\epsilon}_{d}(0^{+})=\\sigma_{M}(0^{+})/\\eta=E_{1}\\epsilon_{0}/\\eta$; there is no Dirac delta in $\\sigma_{M}$.**\nThis option presents a set of values for the initial conditions.\n- $\\epsilon_{s}(0^{+})=\\epsilon_{0}$: Correct, as derived.\n- $\\epsilon_{d}(0^{+})=0$: Correct, as derived from the no-impulsive-stress condition.\n- $\\sigma_{M}(0^{+})=E_{1}\\,\\epsilon_{0}$: Correct, from $\\sigma_{M}(0^{+}) = E_{1}\\epsilon_{s}(0^{+})$.\n- $\\sigma(0^{+})=(E_{1}+E_{2})\\,\\epsilon_{0}$: Correct, from the sum of parallel branch stresses.\n- $\\dot{\\epsilon}_{d}(0^{+})=E_{1}\\epsilon_{0}/\\eta$: Correct, from the dashpot constitutive law.\n- no Dirac delta in $\\sigma_{M}$: Correct, as $\\sigma_{M}(0^{+})$ is finite.\nEvery statement in this option aligns perfectly with our rigorous derivation.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. $\\epsilon_{s}(0^{+})=0$, $\\epsilon_{d}(0^{+})=\\epsilon_{0}$, and the Maxwell branch responds with an impulsive stress $\\sigma_{M}(t)=C\\,\\delta(t)$ for some finite constant $C$ so that $\\sigma(0^{+})=E_{2}\\,\\epsilon_{0}$ remains finite.**\n- $\\epsilon_{s}(0^{+})=0$ and $\\epsilon_{d}(0^{+})=\\epsilon_{0}$: Incorrect.

It is a standard problem in the theory of linear viscoelasticity that tests fundamental principles, including model derivation, determination of material functions, and the relationship between them. The problem is valid and a solution will be provided.\n\nFirst, we derive the differential constitutive equation for the Standard Linear Solid (SLS) model. The total shear stress $\\sigma(t)$ is the sum of the stresses in the two parallel branches. Let the strain in both branches be $\\gamma(t)$.\nThe first branch is a spring with shear modulus $G_{0}$, so its stress is $\\sigma_{A}(t) = G_{0}\\gamma(t)$.\nThe second branch is a Maxwell element with stress $\\sigma_{B}(t)$. The total stress is $\\sigma(t) = \\sigma_{A}(t) + \\sigma_{B}(t) = G_{0}\\gamma(t) + \\sigma_{B}(t)$.\nThe Maxwell element consists of a spring with modulus $G_{1}$ and a dashpot with viscosity $\\eta$ in series. The strain in the Maxwell element is the sum of the strains in its components: $\\gamma(t) = \\gamma_{1}(t) + \\gamma_{d}(t)$. The stress is uniform throughout the series element, so $\\sigma_{B}(t) = G_{1}\\gamma_{1}(t)$ and $\\sigma_{B}(t) = \\eta \\dot{\\gamma}_{d}(t)$, where the dot denotes a time derivative.\nFrom these relations, we have $\\gamma_{1}(t) = \\sigma_{B}(t)/G_{1}$ and $\\dot{\\gamma}_{d}(t) = \\sigma_{B}(t)/\\eta$. Differentiating the strain sum with respect to time gives $\\dot{\\gamma}(t) = \\dot{\\gamma}_{1}(t) + \\dot{\\gamma}_{d}(t) = \\frac{\\dot{\\sigma}_{B}(t)}{G_{1}} + \\frac{\\sigma_{B}(t)}{\\eta}$.\nTo obtain the overall constitutive equation, we substitute $\\sigma_{B}(t) = \\sigma(t) - G_{0}\\gamma(t)$ and $\\dot{\\sigma}_{B}(t) = \\dot{\\sigma}(t) - G_{0}\\dot{\\gamma}(t)$ into the Maxwell element's equation:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{G_{1}}(\\dot{\\sigma}(t) - G_{0}\\dot{\\gamma}(t)) + \\frac{1}{\\eta}(\\sigma(t) - G_{0}\\gamma(t)) = \\dot{\\gamma}(t)\n$$\nMultiplying by $G_{1}\\eta$ and rearranging terms gives the differential constitutive equation:\n$$\n\\eta \\dot{\\sigma}(t) + G_{1} \\sigma(t) = \\eta(G_{0}+G_{1})\\dot{\\gamma}(t) + G_{0}G_{1}\\gamma(t)\n$$\nOr, more commonly, by dividing by $G_1$:\n$$\n\\sigma(t) + \\frac{\\eta}{G_{1}}\\dot{\\sigma}(t) = G_{0}\\gamma(t) + \\eta\\frac{G_{0}+G_{1}}{G_{1}}\\dot{\\gamma}(t)\n$$\n\nNext, we determine the relaxation modulus $G(t)$, which is the stress response $\\sigma(t)$ to a unit step strain, $\\gamma(t) = H(t)$. For $t0$, $\\gamma(t)=1$ and $\\dot{\\gamma}(t)=\\delta(t)$, where $H(t)$ is the Heaviside step function and $\\delta(t)$ is the Dirac delta function.

The long-term stress is $G_{\\infty} = G_{0}$. The characteristic time, known as the relaxation time, is $\\tau_{\\epsilon} = \\eta/G_{1}$. The constant $C$ is found from the initial condition at $t=0^{+}$. The instantaneous response is purely elastic, with both springs acting in parallel, so $G(0^{+}) = G_{0}+G_{1}$. Thus, $G_{0}+G_{1} = G_{0} + C$, which gives $C=G_{1}$. The relaxation modulus is:\n$$\nG(t) = \\left(G_{0} + G_{1}\\exp\\left(-\\frac{t}{\\tau_{\\epsilon}}\\right)\\right)H(t) \\quad \\text{with} \\quad \\tau_{\\epsilon} = \\frac{\\eta}{G_{1}}\n$$\n\nNow, we determine the creep compliance $J(t)$, the strain response $\\gamma(t)$ to a unit step stress, $\\sigma(t) = H(t)$. For $t0$, $\\sigma(t)=1$ and $\\dot{\\sigma}(t)=0$. The constitutive equation becomes:\n$$\nG_{1} = \\eta(G_{0}+G_{1})\\dot{\\gamma}(t) + G_{0}G_{1}\\gamma(t)\n$$\nThis is a first-order non-homogeneous ODE for $\\gamma(t) = J(t)$. The solution is of the form $J(t) = J_{\\infty} + K \\exp(-t/\\tau_{\\sigma})$. The long-term strain $J_{\\infty}$ is found when $\\dot{\\gamma} \\to 0$, giving $G_{1} = G_{0}G_{1}J_{\\infty}$, so $J_{\\infty} = 1/G_{0}$. The characteristic time, the retardation time $\\tau_{\\sigma}$, is found from the homogeneous equation's coefficient ratio: $\\tau_{\\sigma} = \\frac{\\eta(G_{0}+G_{1})}{G_{0}G_{1}}$. The initial strain at $t=0^{+}$ corresponds to the instantaneous elastic response, $J(0^{+}) = 1/(G_{0}+G_{1})$. Therefore, $1/(G_{0}+G_{1}) = 1/G_{0} + K$, which gives $K = \\frac{1}{G_{0}+G_{1}} - \\frac{1}{G_{0}} = -\\frac{G_{1}}{G_{0}(G_{0}+G_{1})}$.

The convolution integral is a constant value of $1$.\n\nThe implication of this result pertains to the invertibility of the linear viscoelastic operators. In the Laplace domain, the constitutive relation can be expressed via transfer functions, e.g., $\\bar{\\sigma}(s) = G(s)\\bar{\\gamma}(s)$, where for the operators to be inverses of each other, the corresponding transfer functions must satisfy $G(s)J(s)=1$. The convolution calculated, $I(t) = \\int_0^t G(t-\\tau)\\dot{J}(\\tau)d\\tau = H(t)$, is the time-domain representation of this fundamental operator identity. Taking the Laplace transform gives $\\mathcal{L}\\{G(t)\\}\\mathcal{L}\\{\\dot{J}(t)\\} = \\mathcal{L}\\{H(t)\\} = 1/s$. Since $\\mathcal{L}\\{\\dot{J}(t)\\} = s\\mathcal{L}\\{J(t)\\}$, this gives $\\mathcal{L}\\{G(t)\\}s\\mathcal{L}\\{J(t)\\} = 1/s$. With the transfer functions defined as $G(s)=s\\mathcal{L}\\{G(t)\\}$ and $J(s)=s\\mathcal{L}\\{J(t)\\}$, the identity is equivalent to $(G(s)/s)J(s)=1/s$, which proves the expected relation $G(s)J(s)=1$. The inversion is well-posed, meaning the response is stable and unique, under the physical condition that all material parameters are positive: $G_{0}0$, $G_{1}0$, and $\\eta0$. These conditions ensure that the poles of the transfer functions lie on the negative real axis in the s-plane, corresponding to decaying (stable) exponential responses in the time domain.\n\nThe final result for the value of the integral for $t0$ is an exact number.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{1}\n$$", "id": "2918588"}, {"introduction": "The true power of viscoelastic models lies in their ability to describe real materials.

It is scientifically grounded, free of ambiguity, and contains all necessary information for a unique solution. We shall proceed with the derivation and solution.\n\nThe foundation of our analysis is the theory of linear viscoelasticity for an isotropic solid under small strains. The material is modeled as a generalized Maxwell model, which consists of an equilibrium spring placed in parallel with a set of Maxwell elements. In this specific problem, there are two such Maxwell elements.\n\nLet us begin by deriving the necessary theoretical expressions for the relaxation modulus and the complex modulus.\n\nA generalized Maxwell model with an equilibrium spring and $N$ Maxwell branches in parallel has a total stress $\\sigma(t)$ that is the sum of the stresses in each parallel component when subjected to a uniform strain $\\epsilon(t)$.\n$$\n\\sigma(t) = \\sigma_{\\infty}(t) + \\sum_{k=1}^{N} \\sigma_{k}(t)\n$$\nHere, $\\sigma_{\\infty}(t)$ is the stress in the equilibrium spring, defined by Hooke's law:\n$$\n\\sigma_{\\infty}(t) = G_{\\infty} \\epsilon(t)\n$$\nwhere $G_{\\infty}$ is the equilibrium modulus. Each Maxwell branch $k$ consists of a spring (modulus $G_k$) and a dashpot (viscosity $\\eta_k$) in series. The constitutive equation for the stress $\\sigma_k(t)$ in the $k$-th branch is given by the first-order ordinary differential equation:\n$$\n\\dot{\\sigma}_k(t) + \\frac{1}{\\tau_k} \\sigma_k(t) = G_k \\dot{\\epsilon}(t)\n$$\nwhere $\\tau_k = \\eta_k / G_k$ is the relaxation time of the branch.\n\nFirst, we derive the uniaxial relaxation modulus, $G(t)$. This is defined as the stress response to a unit step strain, $\\epsilon(t) = \\epsilon_0 H(t)$, where $H(t)$ is the Heaviside step function. Consequently, the strain rate is $\\dot{\\epsilon}(t) = \\epsilon_0 \\delta(t)$, where $\\delta(t)$ is the Dirac delta function. The modulus is $G(t) = \\sigma(t) / \\epsilon_0$.\n\nFor the equilibrium spring, the stress response is $\\sigma_{\\infty}(t) = G_{\\infty} \\epsilon_0 H(t)$. For the $k$-th Maxwell branch, we must solve:\n$$\n\\dot{\\sigma}_k(t) + \\frac{1}{\\tau_k} \\sigma_k(t) = G_k \\epsilon_0 \\delta(t)\n$$\nAssuming the system is at rest for $t  0$, integrating this equation from $t=0^-$ to $t=0^+$ yields the initial condition $\\sigma_k(0^+) = G_k \\epsilon_0$. For $t  0$, the equation becomes homogeneous, $\\dot{\\sigma}_k(t) + (1/\\tau_k) \\sigma_k(t) = 0$, with the solution $\\sigma_k(t) = G_k \\epsilon_0 e^{-t/\\tau_k}$.\n\nSumming the stress contributions from the equilibrium spring and the two specified Maxwell branches ($N=2$), the total stress for $t \\ge 0$ is:\n$$\n\\sigma(t) = G_{\\infty} \\epsilon_0 + G_1 \\epsilon_0 e^{-t/\\tau_1} + G_2 \\epsilon_0 e^{-t/\\tau_2}\n$$\nDividing by $\\epsilon_0$, we obtain the relaxation modulus $G(t)$:\n$$\nG(t) = G_{\\infty} + G_1 e^{-t/\\tau_1} + G_2 e^{-t/\\tau_2}\n$$\n\nNext, we derive the complex modulus, $G^*(\\omega) = G'(\\omega) + i G''(\\omega)$. This is obtained by considering the steady-state response to a sinusoidal strain, $\\epsilon(t) = \\hat{\\epsilon} e^{i\\omega t}$. The stress will also be sinusoidal, $\\sigma(t) = \\hat{\\sigma} e^{i\\omega t}$, and the complex modulus is the ratio of their phasors, $G^*(\\omega) = \\hat{\\sigma} / \\hat{\\epsilon}$.\n\nFor the equilibrium spring, the complex modulus is simply $G^*_{\\infty}(\\omega) = G_{\\infty}$. For the $k$-th Maxwell branch, we substitute the sinusoidal forms of stress and strain into its constitutive equation:\n$$\ni\\omega \\hat{\\sigma}_k e^{i\\omega t} + \\frac{1}{\\tau_k} \\hat{\\sigma}_k e^{i\\omega t} = G_k (i\\omega \\hat{\\epsilon} e^{i\\omega t})\n$$\nSolving for the branch's complex modulus $G_k^*(\\omega) = \\hat{\\sigma}_k / \\hat{\\epsilon}$ gives:\n$$\nG_k^*(\\omega) = G_k \\frac{i\\omega\\tau_k}{1+i\\omega\\tau_k} = G_k \\frac{i\\omega\\tau_k(1-i\\omega\\tau_k)}{1+(\\omega\\tau_k)^2} = G_k \\frac{(\\omega\\tau_k)^2 + i\\omega\\tau_k}{1+(\\omega\\tau_k)^2}\n$$\nThe total complex modulus is the sum of the parallel components:\n$$\nG^*(\\omega) = G^*_{\\infty}(\\omega) + G^*_{1}(\\omega) + G^*_{2}(\\omega) = G_{\\infty} + G_1 \\frac{i\\omega\\tau_1}{1+i\\omega\\tau_1} + G_2 \\frac{i\\omega\\tau_2}{1+i\\omega\\tau_2}\n$$\nSeparating this into its real and imaginary parts yields the storage modulus, $G'(\\omega)$, and the loss modulus, $G''(\\omega)$:\n$$\nG'(\\omega) = \\text{Re}[G^*(\\omega)] = G_{\\infty} + G_1 \\frac{(\\omega\\tau_1)^2}{1+(\\omega\\tau_1)^2} + G_2 \\frac{(\\omega\\tau_2)^2}{1+(\\omega\\tau_2)^2}\n$$\n$$\nG''(\\omega) = \\text{Im}[G^*(\\omega)] = G_1 \\frac{\\omega\\tau_1}{1+(\\omega\\tau_1)^2} + G_2 \\frac{\\omega\\tau_2}{1+(\\omega\\tau_2)^2}\n$$\nThe derived expressions for $G(t)$, $G'(\\omega)$, and $G''(\\omega)$ are all linear with respect to the unknown model parameters $\\boldsymbol{\\theta} = [G_{\\infty}, G_1, G_2]^\\top$. This allows us to formulate the inversion as a linear least-squares problem.\n\nThe objective is to minimize the weighted sum of squared residuals:\n$$\nJ(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}) = \\alpha_t \\lVert A_t \\boldsymbol{\\theta} - \\mathbf{y}_t \\rVert_2^2 + \\alpha_f \\lVert A_f \\boldsymbol{\\theta} - \\mathbf{y}_f \\rVert_2^2\n$$\nLet there be $M_t$ time-domain measurements at times $t_i$ and $M_f$ frequency-domain measurements at angular frequencies $\\omega_j$.

It combines both storage and loss modulus data. We construct a $(2M_f) \\times 3$ matrix $A_f$ and a $(2M_f) \\times 1$ vector $\\mathbf{y}_f$. We stack the $G'$ data first, then the $G''$ data.\nFor $j=1, \\dots, M_f$, the $j$-th row of $A_f$ (corresponding to $G'(\\omega_j)$) is:\n$$\n[A_f]_{j,:} = \\begin{bmatrix} 1  \\frac{(\\omega_j\\tau_1)^2}{1+(\\omega_j\\tau_1)^2}  \\frac{(\\omega_j\\tau_2)^2}{1+(\\omega_j\\tau_2)^2} \\end{bmatrix}\n$$\nThe $(j+M_f)$-th row of $A_f$ (corresponding to $G''(\\omega_j)$) is:\n$$\n[A_f]_{j+M_f,:} = \\begin{bmatrix} 0  \\frac{\\omega_j\\tau_1}{1+(\\omega_j\\tau_1)^2}  \\frac{\\omega_j\\tau_2}{1+(\\omega_j\\tau_2)^2} \\end{bmatrix}\n$$\nThe data vector $\\mathbf{y}_f$ is formed by concatenating the measured $G'(\\omega_j)$ and $G''(\\omega_j)$ values.\n\nThe total objective function $J(\\boldsymbol{\\theta})$ can be minimized by solving a single augmented linear least-squares problem:\n$$\n\\min_{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}} \\left\\lVert \\begin{bmatrix} \\sqrt{\\alpha_t} A_t \\\\ \\sqrt{\\alpha_f} A_f \\end{bmatrix} \\boldsymbol{\\theta} - \\begin{bmatrix} \\sqrt{\\alpha_t} \\mathbf{y}_t \\\\ \\sqrt{\\alpha_f} \\mathbf{y}_f \\end{bmatrix} \\right\\rVert_2^2\n$$\nLet $A_{stack} = \\begin{bmatrix} \\sqrt{\\alpha_t} A_t \\\\ \\sqrt{\\alpha_f} A_f \\end{bmatrix}$ and $\\mathbf{y}_{stack} = \\begin{bmatrix} \\sqrt{\\alpha_t} \\mathbf{y}_t \\\\ \\sqrt{\\alpha_f} \\mathbf{y}_f \\end{bmatrix}$. The problem reduces to finding the least-squares solution $\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}}$ to the system $A_{stack} \\boldsymbol{\\theta} \\approx \\mathbf{y}_{stack}$.
