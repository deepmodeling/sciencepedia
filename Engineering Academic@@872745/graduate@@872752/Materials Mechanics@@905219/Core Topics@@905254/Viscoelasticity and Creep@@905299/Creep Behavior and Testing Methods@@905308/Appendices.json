It presents a standard, albeit simplified, theoretical exercise in materials mechanics concerning diffusion creep. All necessary physical relationships are provided as foundational scaling laws.

The derivation will be based exclusively on the provided foundations.\n\nThe uniaxial strain rate $\\dot{\\varepsilon}$ is of the same order as the volumetric strain rate $\\dot{\\varepsilon}_{\\mathrm{vol}}$. The provided relationship is:\n$$\n\\dot{\\varepsilon} \\sim \\Omega\\,\\nabla\\cdot \\mathbf{J}_a\n$$\nwhere $\\Omega$ is the atomic volume and $\\mathbf{J}_a$ is the atomic flux. The term $\\nabla\\cdot \\mathbf{J}_a$ represents the net rate of atom accumulation or depletion per unit volume.\n\nThe atomic flux $\\mathbf{J}_a$ is given by Fick's first law formulated in terms of the chemical potential gradient $\\nabla \\mu_a$:\n$$\n\\mathbf{J}_a = - \\frac{D c_a}{k_B T}\\nabla \\mu_a\n$$\nHere, $D$ is the relevant diffusivity, $c_a \\approx \\Omega^{-1}$ is the atomic concentration, $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant, and $T$ is the absolute temperature. The magnitude of the flux can be written as:\n$$\n|\\mathbf{J}_a| \\sim \\frac{D (\\Omega^{-1})}{k_B T} |\\nabla \\mu_a| = \\frac{D}{\\Omega k_B T} |\\nabla \\mu_a|\n$$\nThe chemical potential gradient is driven by the hydrostatic stress gradient, $\\nabla \\sigma_h$, according to the given relation $\\nabla \\mu_a \\sim \\Omega\\,\\nabla \\sigma_h$. Under uniaxial stress $\\sigma$, the stress gradient across a grain of size $d$ is given to scale as $|\\nabla \\sigma_h| \\sim \\sigma/d$.

The strain is generated by the divergence of flux, but this divergence only occurs within the grain boundaries. We can find the average strain rate by weighting the local strain rate by the volume fraction of the region where it occurs.\n\nThe volume fraction of grain boundaries, $f_{gb}$, can be estimated from the given scaling for grain-boundary area per unit volume, $A_{gb}/V \\sim 1/d$. The volume of the boundaries per unit total volume is this area times the boundary thickness $\\delta$:\n$$\nf_{gb} = \\frac{V_{gb}}{V_{total}} = \\frac{A_{gb} \\delta}{V_{total}} \\sim \\frac{\\delta}{d}\n$$\nThe divergence of flux *within the grain boundary path* also scales with the characteristic length of the path, which is the grain size $d$. So, $(\\nabla\\cdot \\mathbf{J}_a)_{gb} \\sim | \\mathbf{J}_a | / d$.\n\nThe average strain rate $\\dot{\\varepsilon}_{Coble}$ for the bulk material is the local strain rate within the boundaries, $\\Omega (\\nabla\\cdot \\mathbf{J}_a)_{gb}$, multiplied by the volume fraction $f_{gb}$ where this occurs:\n$$\n\\dot{\\varepsilon}_{Coble} \\sim \\left[ \\Omega (\\nabla\\cdot \\mathbf{J}_a)_{gb} \\right] \\times f_{gb} \\sim \\left( \\Omega \\frac{|\\mathbf{J}_a|}{d} \\right) \\left( \\frac{\\delta}{d} \\right)\n$$\nSubstituting the expression for $|\\mathbf{J}_a|$ with $D=D_{gb}$:\n$$\n\\dot{\\varepsilon}_{Coble} \\sim \\left[ \\Omega \\frac{1}{d} \\left( \\frac{D_{gb} \\sigma}{k_B T d} \\right) \\right] \\left( \\frac{\\delta}{d} \\right) = \\frac{\\Omega D_{gb} \\delta \\sigma}{k_B T d^3}\n$$\nThus, for Coble creep, the steady-state strain rate is proportional to the inverse cube of the grain size:\n$$\n\\dot{\\varepsilon}_{Coble} \\propto d^{-3}\n$$\n\n**Calculation of the Change in Creep Rate**\n\nNow, we compute the multiplicative factor by which $\\dot{\\varepsilon}$ changes when the grain size is doubled from $d_1 = d$ to $d_2 = 2d$.

Mass conservation links the divergence of flux to the volumetric strain rate and, after geometrical averaging for equiaxed grains, yields the well-tested scaling laws\n$$\n\\dot{\\varepsilon}_{\\mathrm{NH}} \\sim C_{\\mathrm{NH}}\\,\\frac{D_{L}\\,\\Omega}{k_{B} T}\\,\\frac{\\sigma}{d^{2}}, \n\\qquad\n\\dot{\\varepsilon}_{\\mathrm{Cob}} \\sim C_{\\mathrm{Cob}}\\,\\frac{D_{gb}\\,\\delta\\,\\Omega}{k_{B} T}\\,\\frac{\\sigma}{d^{3}},\n$$\nwhere $C_{\\mathrm{NH}}$ and $C_{\\mathrm{Cob}}$ are dimensionless geometric constants appropriate to equiaxed grains, $D_{L}$ is the lattice diffusivity, and $D_{gb}\\,\\delta$ is the grain-boundary diffusivity–width product. These expressions embody the rate-limiting vacancy transport by lattice diffusion (Nabarro–Herring) and boundary diffusion (Coble), respectively.\n\nFor dislocation-controlled steady-state creep at high temperature, the phenomenological Norton relation encapsulates the steady dislocation glide/climb kinetics and obstacle dynamics:\n$$\n\\dot{\\varepsilon}_{\\mathrm{disl}} = A_{d}\\,\\sigma^{n}\\,\\exp\\!\\left(-\\frac{Q_{d}}{R T}\\right),\n$$\nwith the given pre-exponential $A_{d}$, stress exponent $n$, and activation energy $Q_{d}$. This form is consistent with dislocation climb control because the exponential temperature dependence reflects the underlying vacancy diffusion energetics.\n\nWe now compute each rate numerically with the provided data.\n\nGiven:\n- $T = 1100\\ \\mathrm{K}$,\n- $\\sigma = 60\\ \\mathrm{MPa} = 6.0\\times 10^{7}\\ \\mathrm{Pa}$,\n- $d = 5.0\\times 10^{-6}\\ \\mathrm{m}$,\n- $D_{L} = 6.0\\times 10^{-18}\\ \\mathrm{m}^{2}\\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1}$,\n- $D_{gb}\\,\\delta = 5.0\\times 10^{-24}\\ \\mathrm{m}^{3}\\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1}$,\n- $\\Omega = 1.09\\times 10^{-29}\\ \\mathrm{m}^{3}$,\n- $k_{B} T = (1.380649\\times 10^{-23})(1100) = 1.5187139\\times 10^{-20}\\ \\mathrm{J}$,\n- $d^{2} = (5.0\\times 10^{-6})^{2} = 2.5\\times 10^{-11}\\ \\mathrm{m}^{2}$,\n- $d^{3} = (5.0\\times 10^{-6})^{3} = 1.25\\times 10^{-16}\\ \\mathrm{m}^{3}$,\n- $C_{\\mathrm{NH}} = 10.0$, $C_{\\mathrm{Cob}} = 130.0$.\n\n1) Nabarro–Herring diffusion creep:\n$$\n\\dot{\\varepsilon}_{\\mathrm{NH}} \n= C_{\\mathrm{NH}}\\,\\frac{D_{L}\\,\\Omega\\,\\sigma}{k_{B} T\\,d^{2}}\n= 10.0\\cdot\\frac{(6.0\\times 10^{-18})(1.09\\times 10^{-29})(6.0\\times 10^{7})}{(1.5187139\\times 10^{-20})(2.5\\times 10^{-11})}.\n$$\nCompute the numerator:\n$$\n(6.0\\times 10^{-18})(1.09\\times 10^{-29})(6.0\\times 10^{7})\n= 3.924\\times 10^{-39}.\n$$\nCompute the denominator:\n$$\n(1.5187139\\times 10^{-20})(2.5\\times 10^{-11}) = 3.79678475\\times 10^{-31}.\n$$\nHence\n$$\n\\dot{\\varepsilon}_{\\mathrm{NH}} = 10.0\\times \\frac{3.924\\times 10^{-39}}{3.79678475\\times 10^{-31}} \n= 10.0\\times 1.033546\\times 10^{-8}\n= 1.033546\\times 10^{-7}\\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1}.\n$$\n\n2) Coble diffusion creep:\n$$\n\\dot{\\varepsilon}_{\\mathrm{Cob}} \n= C_{\\mathrm{Cob}}\\,\\frac{D_{gb}\\,\\delta\\,\\Omega\\,\\sigma}{k_{B} T\\,d^{3}}\n= 130.0\\cdot\\frac{(5.0\\times 10^{-24})(1.09\\times 10^{-29})(6.0\\times 10^{7})}{(1.5187139\\times 10^{-20})(1.25\\times 10^{-16})}.\n$$\nCompute the numerator:\n$$\n(5.0\\times 10^{-24})(1.09\\times 10^{-29})(6.0\\times 10^{7})\n= 3.27\\times 10^{-45}.\n$$\nCompute the denominator:\n$$\n(1.5187139\\times 10^{-20})(1.25\\times 10^{-16}) = 1.898392375\\times 10^{-36}.\n$$\nHence\n$$\n\\dot{\\varepsilon}_{\\mathrm{Cob}} = 130.0\\times \\frac{3.27\\times 10^{-45}}{1.898392375\\times 10^{-36}}\n= 130.0\\times 1.72111\\times 10^{-9}\n= 2.23744\\times 10^{-7}\\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1}.\n$$\nTherefore, for the given $d$ and $T$, grain-boundary diffusion (Coble) is the governing diffusion-creep mechanism, since $\\dot{\\varepsilon}_{\\mathrm{Cob}}  \\dot{\\varepsilon}_{\\mathrm{NH}}$.\n\n3) Dislocation creep (Norton relation):\nGiven $A_{d} = 1.00\\times 10^{-28}\\ \\mathrm{Pa}^{-n}\\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1}$, $n=4.5$, $Q_{d} = 2.80\\times 10^{5}\\ \\mathrm{J}\\ \\mathrm{mol}^{-1}$, and $R=8.314\\ \\mathrm{J}\\ \\mathrm{mol}^{-1}\\ \\mathrm{K}^{-1}$,\n$$\n\\dot{\\varepsilon}_{\\mathrm{disl}} \n= A_{d}\\,\\sigma^{n}\\,\\exp\\!\\left(-\\frac{Q_{d}}{R T}\\right).\n$$\nCompute the Arrhenius factor:\n$$\n\\frac{Q_{d}}{R T} = \\frac{2.80\\times 10^{5}}{(8.314)(1100)} \\approx 30.62,\n\\quad\n\\exp\\!\\left(-\\frac{Q_{d}}{R T}\\right) \\approx \\exp(-30.62) \\approx 5.03\\times 10^{-14}.\n$$\nCompute $\\sigma^{n}$:\n$$\n\\sigma^{4.5} = (6.0\\times 10^{7})^{4.5} = 10^{35.00168} \\approx 1.00388\\times 10^{35}.\n$$\nTherefore,\n$$\n\\dot{\\varepsilon}_{\\mathrm{disl}} \n= (1.00\\times 10^{-28})(1.00388\\times 10^{35})(5.03\\times 10^{-14})\n= (1.00388\\times 10^{7})(5.03\\times 10^{-14})\n\\approx 5.0495\\times 10^{-7}\\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1}.\n$$\n\nFinally, the requested ratio is\n$$\n\\mathcal{R} = \\frac{\\dot{\\varepsilon}_{\\mathrm{disl}}}{\\max(\\dot{\\varepsilon}_{\\mathrm{NH}},\\dot{\\varepsilon}_{\\mathrm{Cob}})}\n= \\frac{5.0495\\times 10^{-7}}{2.23744\\times 10^{-7}} \\approx 2.26.\n$$\n\nThus, under the stated conditions, the predicted steady-state dislocation-creep rate is about $2.26$ times the governing diffusion-creep rate (Coble), so dislocation creep is faster.
