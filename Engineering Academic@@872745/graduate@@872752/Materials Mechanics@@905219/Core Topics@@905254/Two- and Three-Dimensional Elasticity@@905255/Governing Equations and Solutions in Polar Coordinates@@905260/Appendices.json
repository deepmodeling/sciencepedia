Equilibrium Equation**\nFor an axisymmetric state in polar coordinates, the radial equilibrium equation including a radial body force per unit volume, $F_r$, is:\n$$ \\frac{d\\sigma_r}{dr} + \\frac{\\sigma_r - \\sigma_\\theta}{r} + F_r = 0 $$\nThe centrifugal body force is $F_r = \\rho \\omega^2 r$.

Kinematic and Constitutive Relations**\nThe kinematic relations for an axisymmetric problem connect the radial strain $\\epsilon_r$ and hoop strain $\\epsilon_\\theta$ to the radial displacement $u_r(r)$:\n$$ \\epsilon_r = \\frac{du_r}{dr}, \\quad \\epsilon_\\theta = \\frac{u_r}{r} $$\nThe constitutive law for a linear elastic, isotropic material under plane stress ($\\sigma_z = 0$) is given by:\n$$ \\epsilon_r = \\frac{1}{E}(\\sigma_r - \\nu\\sigma_\\theta) $$\n$$ \\epsilon_\\theta = \\frac{1}{E}(\\sigma_\\theta - \\nu\\sigma_r) $$\nThese can be inverted to express stress in terms of strain:\n$$ \\sigma_r = \\frac{E}{1-\\nu^2}(\\epsilon_r + \\nu\\epsilon_\\theta) $$\n$$ \\sigma_\\theta = \\frac{E}{1-\\nu^2}(\\epsilon_\\theta + \\nu\\epsilon_r) $$\n\n**3.

This will yield a single ordinary differential equation in terms of the displacement $u_r(r)$.\n$$ \\frac{d}{dr}\\left[r \\frac{E}{1-\\nu^2}\\left(\\frac{du_r}{dr} + \\nu\\frac{u_r}{r}\\right)\\right] - \\frac{E}{1-\\nu^2}\\left(\\frac{u_r}{r} + \\nu\\frac{du_r}{dr}\\right) + \\rho \\omega^2 r^2 = 0 $$\nAfter differentiation and algebraic simplification, this reduces to the following non-homogeneous Cauchy-Euler equation:\n$$ r^2\\frac{d^2u_r}{dr^2} + r\\frac{du_r}{dr} - u_r = -\\frac{\\rho \\omega^2 (1-\\nu^2)}{E}r^3 $$\n\n**4. Solution of the Differential Equation**\nThe general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution $u_h(r)$ and a particular solution $u_p(r)$.\nThe homogeneous equation is $r^2 u_h'' + r u_h' - u_h = 0$. Assuming a solution of the form $u_h = C r^m$ leads to the characteristic equation $m^2 - 1 = 0$, with roots $m = \\pm 1$. Thus, $u_h(r) = C_1 r + C_2 r^{-1}$.\nFor the particular solution, we assume a form $u_p(r) = A r^3$. Substituting into the non-homogeneous equation yields:\n$$ A(6r^3) + A(3r^3) - A(r^3) = -\\frac{\\rho \\omega^2 (1-\\nu^2)}{E}r^3 \\implies 8A = -\\frac{\\rho \\omega^2 (1-\\nu^2)}{E} $$\nSo, $A = -\\frac{\\rho \\omega^2 (1-\\nu^2)}{8E}$.

Application of Boundary Conditions**\nThe constants $C_1$ and $C_2$ are determined from the boundary conditions.\n- At the center of the disk ($r=0$), the displacement must be finite. The term $C_2/r$ would be infinite unless $C_2=0$. Therefore, to satisfy boundedness, we must have $C_2=0$.\n- The radial stress at the free outer edge ($r=a$) is zero: $\\sigma_r(a)=0$. We first find the expression for $\\sigma_r(r)$ using the simplified displacement $u_r(r) = C_1 r - \\frac{\\rho \\omega^2 (1-\\nu^2)}{8E}r^3$:\n$$ \\sigma_r(r) = \\frac{E}{1-\\nu^2}\\left[ \\left(C_1 - \\frac{3\\rho \\omega^2 (1-\\nu^2)}{8E}r^2\\right) + \\nu \\left(C_1 - \\frac{\\rho \\omega^2 (1-\\nu^2)}{8E}r^2\\right) \\right] $$\n$$ \\sigma_r(r) = \\frac{E(1+\\nu)}{1-\\nu^2}C_1 - \\frac{\\rho \\omega^2 (3+\\nu)}{8}r^2 = \\frac{E}{1-\\nu}C_1 - \\frac{\\rho \\omega^2 (3+\\nu)}{8}r^2 $$\nApplying $\\sigma_r(a)=0$:\n$$ 0 = \\frac{E}{1-\\nu}C_1 - \\frac{\\rho \\omega^2 (3+\\nu)}{8}a^2 \\implies C_1 = \\frac{(1-\\nu)}{E}\\frac{\\rho \\omega^2 (3+\\nu)}{8}a^2 $$\n\n**6. Derivation of Hoop Stress and Its Maximum**\nNow we derive the expression for the hoop stress, $\\sigma_\\theta(r)$:\n$$ \\sigma_\\theta(r) = \\frac{E}{1-\\nu^2}\\left[ \\left(C_1 - \\frac{\\rho \\omega^2 (1-\\nu^2)}{8E}r^2\\right) + \\nu \\left(C_1 - \\frac{3\\rho \\omega^2 (1-\\nu^2)}{8E}r^2\\right) \\right] $$\n$$ \\sigma_\\theta(r) = \\frac{E(1+\\nu)}{1-\\nu^2}C_1 - \\frac{\\rho \\omega^2 (1+3\\nu)}{8}r^2 = \\frac{E}{1-\\nu}C_1 - \\frac{\\rho \\omega^2 (1+3\\nu)}{8}r^2 $$\nSubstituting the solved value for the term containing $C_1$:\n$$ \\sigma_\\theta(r) = \\frac{\\rho \\omega^2 (3+\\nu)}{8}a^2 - \\frac{\\rho \\omega^2 (1+3\\nu)}{8}r^2 $$\n$$ \\sigma_\\theta(r) = \\frac{\\rho \\omega^2}{8}\\left[ (3+\\nu)a^2 - (1+3\\nu)r^2 \\right] $$\nTo find the maximum value of $\\sigma_\\theta(r)$ in the domain $0 \\le r \\le a$, we examine its derivative with respect to $r$:\n$$ \\frac{d\\sigma_\\theta}{dr} = -\\frac{\\rho \\omega^2}{8}[2(1+3\\nu)r] = -\\frac{\\rho \\omega^2 (1+3\\nu)}{4}r $$\nGiven that $\\rho  0$ and $0 \\le \\nu  \\tfrac{1}{2}$, the coefficient $(1+3\\nu)$ is strictly positive. Thus, $\\frac{d\\sigma_\\theta}{dr} \\le 0$ for $r \\ge 0$. This indicates that $\\sigma_\\theta(r)$ is a monotonically decreasing function of $r$. Its maximum value must therefore occur at $r=0$.\nThe location of the maximum hoop stress is the center of the disk, $r=0$. The maximum value is:\n$$ \\sigma_{\\theta,\\max} = \\sigma_\\theta(0) = \\frac{\\rho \\omega^2}{8}\\left[ (3+\\nu)a^2 - 0 \\right] = \\frac{\\rho \\omega^2 a^2 (3+\\nu)}{8} $$\n\n**7.
