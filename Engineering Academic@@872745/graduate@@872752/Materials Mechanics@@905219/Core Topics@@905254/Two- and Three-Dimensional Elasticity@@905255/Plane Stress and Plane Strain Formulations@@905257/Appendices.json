We will derive this for plane stress and plane strain conditions.\n\nFirst, we consider the case of plane stress.\nThe defining condition for plane stress is that the stress components normal to the $x$-$y$ plane are zero. This means $\\sigma_{z} = \\tau_{xz} = \\tau_{yz} = 0$. Applying this to the general $3$D compliance matrix allows us to extract the in-plane relationships:\n$$ \\epsilon_{x} = \\frac{1}{E} ( \\sigma_{x} - \\nu \\sigma_{y} ) $$\n$$ \\epsilon_{y} = \\frac{1}{E} ( -\\nu \\sigma_{x} + \\sigma_{y} ) $$\n$$ \\gamma_{xy} = \\frac{2(1+\\nu)}{E} \\tau_{xy} $$\nIn matrix form using Voigt notation, this is:\n$$\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n\\epsilon_{x} \\\\\n\\epsilon_{y} \\\\\n\\gamma_{xy}\n\\end{pmatrix}\n=\n\\frac{1}{E}\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n1 & -\\nu & 0 \\\\\n-\\nu & 1 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 2(1+\\nu)\n\\end{pmatrix}\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n\\sigma_{x} \\\\\n\\sigma_{y} \\\\\n\\tau_{xy}\n\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe plane stress stiffness matrix, $\\boldsymbol{D}^{\\text{(plane stress)}}$, is obtained by inverting this compliance matrix.

The squared term $(\\bar{\\epsilon}_{xx}+\\bar{\\epsilon}_{yy})^2$ is also non-negative.\nTherefore, $\\Delta U_0 = U_0^{PE} - U_0^{PS} \\ge 0$.\n\nThe total strain energy per unit thickness in plane strain is greater than or equal to that in plane stress. Equality, $\\Delta U_0 = 0$, holds if and only if $\\nu=0$ or $\\bar{\\epsilon}_{xx}+\\bar{\\epsilon}_{yy}=0$.\n\nThe physical reason for this result lies in the nature of the constraints. The plane strain condition, $\\epsilon_{zz}=0$, is a kinematic constraint that prevents the material from deforming in the thickness direction. If $\\bar{\\epsilon}_{xx}+\\bar{\\epsilon}_{yy} \\ne 0$ and $\\nu \\ne 0$, the material has a natural tendency to deform in the $z$-direction due to the Poisson effect. Preventing this deformation requires a stress $\\sigma_{zz} = \\lambda(\\bar{\\epsilon}_{xx}+\\bar{\\epsilon}_{yy})$, which in turn stiffens the in-plane response. The plane stress condition, $\\sigma_{zz}=0$, allows this Poisson deformation to occur freely ($\\epsilon_{zz} \\ne 0$), representing a \"relaxed\" or less constrained state. For the same imposed in-plane strain, the more constrained (stiffer) system stores more energy.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. For any given uniform in-plane strains $\\,\\bar{\\epsilon}_{xx},\\bar{\\epsilon}_{yy},\\bar{\\epsilon}_{xy}\\,$, the total strain energy in plane strain is greater than or equal to that in plane stress, with equality if and only if $\\,\\bar{\\epsilon}_{xx}+\\bar{\\epsilon}_{yy}=0\\,$; the additional out-of-plane kinematic constraint in plane strain prevents Poisson relaxation, increasing stored energy.**\n- The statement that plane strain energy is greater than or equal to plane stress energy is **Correct**.\n- The physical explanation that the additional kinematic constraint prevents Poisson relaxation and increases stored energy is **Correct**.\n- The condition for equality, \"if and only if $\\bar{\\epsilon}_{xx}+\\bar{\\epsilon}_{yy}=0$\", is incomplete. As derived, equality also holds if $\\nu=0$. For a generic material where $\\nu \\neq 0$ is implicitly assumed, this condition would be correct. Despite this minor imprecision, the statement captures the essential physics and is the most accurate among the choices.\nVerdict: **Correct** (with a minor qualification on the completeness of the equality condition).\n\n**B. The total strain energies are identical for plane stress and plane strain whenever the same in-plane boundary displacements are prescribed, because the in-plane strain field is the same in both cases and out-of-plane behavior does not enter the energy.**\n- The claim that energies are identical is false, as shown by the derivation of $\\Delta U_0$.\n- The reason given, that out-of-plane behavior does not enter the energy, is also false. The out-of-plane components $\\epsilon_{zz}$ and $\\sigma_{zz}$ are coupled to the in-plane components and affect the total stored energy.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**C. The total strain energy in plane stress exceeds that in plane strain for the same prescribed in-plane boundary displacements, because setting $\\,\\sigma_{zz}=0\\,$ removes a load path and forces the in-plane stresses to carry more energy.**\n- The claim that plane stress energy exceeds plane strain energy is the opposite of the correct result.\n- The reasoning is flawed. The plane stress condition $\\sigma_{zz}=0$ represents a *less* constrained state, which is more compliant and stores *less* energy for a given imposed deformation compared to the more constrained plane strain case.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. The ordering of total strain energy depends on the sign of Poisson’s ratio: plane strain stores more energy if $\\,\\nu>0\\,$, but plane stress stores more energy if $\\,\\nu<0\\,$ because auxetic materials expand laterally and relieve constraint.**\n- The energy difference $\\Delta U_0$ depends on $\\nu^2$, not $\\nu$. The sign of Poisson's ratio does not affect the ordering; plane strain energy is always greater than or equal to plane stress energy for any $\\nu$ in the valid range, including negative values (auxetic materials).\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\nConclusion: Option A is the only statement that correctly identifies the relationship between the energies and provides the correct physical justification, despite a minor imprecision in its \"if and only if\" condition. It is the correct answer.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2908563"}]}
