It presents a standard exercise in engineering plasticity using a consistent and realistic dataset for low-carbon steel. All necessary parameters and data are provided, and there are no internal contradictions or violations of fundamental principles. The problem is valid and a solution will be provided.\n\nFirst, we clarify the operational definition of the $0.2\\%$ offset proof stress. The total strain $\\varepsilon$ is additively decomposed into an elastic component $\\varepsilon_e$ and a plastic component $\\varepsilon_p$, such that $\\varepsilon = \\varepsilon_e + \\varepsilon_p$. The elastic strain is related to the stress $\\sigma$ by Hooke's law, $\\varepsilon_e = \\sigma/E$, where $E$ is the Young's modulus. The plastic strain is therefore given by $\\varepsilon_p = \\varepsilon - \\sigma/E$. The $0.2\\%$ offset criterion defines the proof stress, denoted $\\sigma_y$, as the stress level at which the magnitude of the plastic strain reaches the value $0.002$. To find this stress from an experimental stress-strain curve, one must find the intersection of the curve $\\sigma(\\varepsilon)$ with the line defined by the condition $\\varepsilon_p = \\pm 0.002$. This is equivalent to solving the system:\n$$\n\\sigma = f(\\varepsilon) \\quad (\\text{experimental curve})\n$$\n$$\n\\varepsilon - \\frac{\\sigma}{E} = \\varepsilon_p^{\\text{offset}}\n$$\nwhere $\\varepsilon_p^{\\text{offset}} = 0.002$ for tension and $\\varepsilon_p^{\\text{offset}} = -0.002$ for compression. The second equation can be rewritten as $\\sigma = E(\\varepsilon - \\varepsilon_p^{\\text{offset}})$. This offset line is parallel to the initial elastic loading line, $\\sigma = E\\varepsilon$, but shifted along the strain axis by the amount $\\varepsilon_p^{\\text{offset}}$.\n\nFor the virgin material, loading starts from $(\\varepsilon, \\sigma) = (0, 0)$. The offset line for determining the initial proof stress $\\sigma_{y0}$ is $\\sigma = E(\\varepsilon - 0.002)$.\nFor reloading from an unloaded state with residual plastic strain $\\varepsilon_p^{\\text{res}}$ at $(\\varepsilon, \\sigma) = (\\varepsilon_p^{\\text{res}}, 0)$, the subsequent plastic strain is referenced to this new state. For forward reloading, the proof stress $\\sigma_y^{\\text{fwd}}$ is found at a plastic strain of $\\varepsilon_p^{\\text{res}} + 0.002$, so the offset line is $\\sigma = E(\\varepsilon - (\\varepsilon_p^{\\text{res}} + 0.002))$. For reverse loading, the proof stress $\\sigma_y^{\\text{rev}}$ is found at a plastic strain of $\\varepsilon_p^{\\text{res}} - 0.002$, so the offset line is $\\sigma = E(\\varepsilon - (\\varepsilon_p^{\\text{res}} - 0.002))$.\n\nThe Young's modulus is given as $E = 210\\,\\mathrm{GPa} = 210 \\times 10^3\\,\\mathrm{MPa}$. The initial data points $(0,0)$, $(0.0005, 105)$, and $(0.0010, 210)$ confirm this value, as the slope is $\\frac{210\\,\\mathrm{MPa}}{0.0010} = 210 \\times 10^3\\,\\mathrm{MPa}$.\n\nDetermination of the initial proof stress $\\sigma_{y0}$:\nThe offset line is $\\sigma = 210000(\\varepsilon - 0.002)$. We must find the intersection of this line with the virgin stress-strain curve. The provided data appears to have been constructed such that one of the points lies on this intersection. We check the point $(\\varepsilon, \\sigma) = (0.0034286, 300\\,\\mathrm{MPa})$.\nThe strain on the offset line corresponding to $\\sigma = 300\\,\\mathrm{MPa}$ is $\\varepsilon = \\frac{\\sigma}{E} + 0.002 = \\frac{300}{210000} + 0.002 = \\frac{1}{700} + 0.002 \\approx 0.00142857 + 0.002 = 0.00342857$. This value is negligibly different from the given strain of $0.0034286$. Thus, the point $(0.0034286,\\,300\\,\\mathrm{MPa})$ represents the intersection.\nThe initial $0.2\\%$ proof stress is $\\sigma_{y0} = 300\\,\\mathrm{MPa}$.\n\nDetermination of the residual plastic strain after prestrain:\nThe specimen is loaded to $(\\varepsilon_{\\text{max}}, \\sigma_{\\text{max}}) = (0.0120, 420\\,\\mathrm{MPa})$ and then unloaded elastically to $\\sigma = 0$. The elastic strain recovered during unloading is $\\Delta\\varepsilon_e = \\frac{\\Delta\\sigma}{E} = \\frac{0 - 420\\,\\mathrm{MPa}}{210000\\,\\mathrm{MPa}} = -0.002$.\nThe total strain at the unloaded state is $\\varepsilon_{\\text{res}} = \\varepsilon_{\\text{max}} + \\Delta\\varepsilon_e = 0.0120 - 0.002 = 0.0100$. This matches the provided unloaded state $(\\varepsilon, \\sigma) = (0.0100, 0)$. At this point, the stress is zero, so the elastic strain is zero. The entire remaining strain is plastic.\nThe residual plastic strain is $\\varepsilon_p^{\\text{res}} = 0.0100$.\n\nDetermination of the reverse proof stress $\\sigma_{y}^{\\text{rev}}$:\nReverse loading starts from $(\\varepsilon, \\sigma) = (0.0100, 0)$. The offset line for reverse yielding is $\\sigma = E(\\varepsilon - (\\varepsilon_p^{\\text{res}} - 0.002)) = 210000(\\varepsilon - (0.0100 - 0.002)) = 210000(\\varepsilon - 0.008)$.\nWe examine the provided reverse-loading data point $(\\varepsilon, \\sigma) = (0.0067143, -270\\,\\mathrm{MPa})$. The strain on the offset line for $\\sigma = -270\\,\\mathrm{MPa}$ is $\\varepsilon = \\frac{\\sigma}{E} + 0.008 = \\frac{-270}{210000} + 0.008 \\approx -0.00128571 + 0.008 = 0.00671429$. This value is consistent with the given strain of $0.0067143$. Thus, this point is the reverse yield point.\nThe reverse proof stress is $\\sigma = -270\\,\\mathrm{MPa}$. The problem specifies using its magnitude, so $\\sigma_{y}^{\\text{rev}} = 270\\,\\mathrm{MPa}$.\n\nDetermination of the forward proof stress $\\sigma_{y}^{\\text{fwd}}$:\nForward reloading also starts from $(\\varepsilon, \\sigma) = (0.0100, 0)$. The offset line is $\\sigma = E(\\varepsilon - (\\varepsilon_p^{\\text{res}} + 0.002)) = 210000(\\varepsilon - (0.0100 + 0.002)) = 210000(\\varepsilon - 0.012)$.\nWe examine the provided forward-reloading data point $(\\varepsilon, \\sigma) = (0.0137143, 360\\,\\mathrm{MPa})$. The strain on the offset line for $\\sigma = 360\\,\\mathrm{MPa}$ is $\\varepsilon = \\frac{\\sigma}{E} + 0.012 = \\frac{360}{210000} + 0.012 \\approx 0.00171429 + 0.012 = 0.01371429$. This value is consistent with the given strain of $0.0137143$. Thus, this point is the forward reload yield point.\nThe forward proof stress is $\\sigma_{y}^{\\text{fwd}} = 360\\,\\mathrm{MPa}$.\n\nComputation of the Bauschinger ratio $\\beta$:\nThe Bauschinger ratio is defined as $\\beta = \\frac{\\sigma_{y}^{\\text{rev}}-\\sigma_{y0}}{\\sigma_{y}^{\\text{fwd}}-\\sigma_{y0}}$. Substituting the determined values:\n$$\n\\beta = \\frac{270\\,\\mathrm{MPa} - 300\\,\\mathrm{MPa}}{360\\,\\mathrm{MPa} - 300\\,\\mathrm{MPa}} = \\frac{-30\\,\\mathrm{MPa}}{60\\,\\mathrm{MPa}} = -0.5\n$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to three significant figures. Thus, $\\beta = -0.500$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{-0.500}$$", "id": "2867506"}, {"introduction": "Building on the observation of the Bauschinger effect, this exercise challenges you to think like a material modeler.

The Bauschinger effect manifests as an anomalously early yield upon reverse loading, here evidenced by $|\\sigma_{c}^{\\mathrm{rev}}| \\ll \\sigma_{y0}$. To separate elastic from inelastic contributions, determine $E$ from the linear unloading/reloading segments and compute the instantaneous plastic strain as $\\varepsilon^{p} = \\varepsilon - \\sigma/E$ along the loop. Identify reverse yield points as the first departures from the linear elastic slope. For a uniaxial yield function with combined hardening, the tensile and compressive reverse yield stresses are related to the current backstress $\\alpha$ and the current radius $\\sigma_{y0}+R$; solving these relations with the measured $\\sigma_{t}^{\\mathrm{rev}} = +430\\ \\mathrm{MPa}$ and $\\sigma_{c}^{\\mathrm{rev}} = -110\\ \\mathrm{MPa}$ gives $\\alpha = 160\\ \\mathrm{MPa}$ and $R = 70\\ \\mathrm{MPa}$.\n\nB. The Bauschinger effect increases the magnitude of reverse yield relative to the virgin yield, so $|\\sigma_{c}^{\\mathrm{rev}}| > \\sigma_{y0}$. Elastic contributions need not be separated if the loop closes. The kinematic and isotropic parts are then obtained by $\\alpha = \\tfrac{1}{2}\\left(\\sigma_{t}^{\\mathrm{rev}} - \\sigma_{c}^{\\mathrm{rev}}\\right)$ and $R = \\tfrac{1}{2}\\left(\\sigma_{t}^{\\mathrm{rev}} + \\sigma_{c}^{\\mathrm{rev}}\\right) - \\sigma_{y0}$, which yield $\\alpha = 270\\ \\mathrm{MPa}$ and $R = -40\\ \\mathrm{MPa}$.\n\nC. The Bauschinger effect is irrelevant when there is nonzero elastic unloading. The elastic and kinematic contributions are separated by the enclosed area of the hysteresis loop, because area equals the kinematic hardening energy. The backstress $\\alpha$ is obtained from the area divided by the loop width, and the isotropic hardening $R$ from the area divided by the loop height; no use of $E$ or yield points is needed.\n\nD. The Bauschinger effect appears only after the stress passes through zero; therefore the backstress equals the stress at reversal, $\\alpha \\approx 100\\ \\mathrm{MPa}$. The isotropic hardening level is then the half-width of the loop minus this value, giving $R \\approx 170\\ \\mathrm{MPa}$. Separation of elastic effects is unnecessary because the unloading slope equals $E$.\n\nE. The Bauschinger effect manifests as a reduced reverse yield magnitude. To separate elastic and plastic strains, one must integrate the unloading path to obtain elastic strain without using $E$.

The concepts of additive strain decomposition, linear elasticity, and combined kinematic/isotropic hardening are standard. The Bauschinger effect is a well-established phenomenon. The problem is well-posed; it provides sufficient data to determine the two unknown internal state variables, $\\alpha$ and $R$, within the specified model. The language is objective and uses standard nomenclature. All numerical values are physically realistic for a metallic material such as steel. The condition $\\sigma_{\\max} = 420\\ \\mathrm{MPa} > \\sigma_{y0} = 200\\ \\mathrm{MPa}$ confirms that plastic deformation occurs as stated. The observation of reverse yield at $|\\sigma_{c}^{\\mathrm{rev}}| = 110\\ \\mathrm{MPa}  \\sigma_{y0} = 200\\ \\mathrm{MPa}$ is the hallmark of the Bauschinger effect and is consistent with the model. The formulation does not contain contradictions, ambiguities, or scientifically unsound premises.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem statement is valid. A rigorous solution can be derived.\n\n**Derivation of Solution**\n\nThe foundation of the model is the one-dimensional yield condition, which defines the elastic domain. For combined isotropic and kinematic hardening, the yield function $f$ is given by:\n$$ f(\\sigma, \\alpha, R) = |\\sigma - \\alpha| - (\\sigma_{y0} + R) $$\nThe material remains elastic as long as $f  0$. Plastic flow initiates when $f = 0$. Here, $\\sigma$ is the applied uniaxial stress, $\\alpha$ is the backstress (the center of the elastic domain), and $\\sigma_y = \\sigma_{y0} + R$ is the current yield strength (the radius of the elastic domain in stress space, relative to the center $\\alpha$).\n\nThe boundary of the elastic range is defined by the two conditions:\n1.  Yield in tension: $\\sigma_t - \\alpha = \\sigma_{y0} + R$\n2.  Yield in compression: $\\sigma_c - \\alpha = -(\\sigma_{y0} + R)$\n\nThis gives the tensile and compressive yield limits as a function of the internal state variables $\\alpha$ and $R$:\n$$ \\sigma_t = \\alpha + (\\sigma_{y0} + R) $$\n$$ \\sigma_c = \\alpha - (\\sigma_{y0} + R) $$\n\nThe problem provides the measured yield limits after a certain loading history: $\\sigma_{t}^{\\mathrm{rev}} = +430\\ \\mathrm{MPa}$ and $\\sigma_{c}^{\\mathrm{rev}} = -110\\ \\mathrm{MPa}$. These correspond to the values of $\\sigma_t$ and $\\sigma_c$ for the material's current state. We thus have a system of two linear equations for the two unknowns, $\\alpha$ and $R$:\n1.  $430\\ \\mathrm{MPa} = \\alpha + (\\sigma_{y0} + R)$\n2.  $-110\\ \\mathrm{MPa} = \\alpha - (\\sigma_{y0} + R)$\n\nTo solve for $\\alpha$, we add the two equations:\n$$ (430\\ \\mathrm{MPa}) + (-110\\ \\mathrm{MPa}) = [\\alpha + (\\sigma_{y0} + R)] + [\\alpha - (\\sigma_{y0} + R)] $$\n$$ 320\\ \\mathrm{MPa} = 2\\alpha $$\n$$ \\alpha = \\frac{320\\ \\mathrm{MPa}}{2} = 160\\ \\mathrm{MPa} $$\n\nTo solve for the current yield radius, $\\sigma_{y0} + R$, we subtract the second equation from the first:\n$$ (430\\ \\mathrm{MPa}) - (-110\\ \\mathrm{MPa}) = [\\alpha + (\\sigma_{y0} + R)] - [\\alpha - (\\sigma_{y0} + R)] $$\n$$ 540\\ \\mathrm{MPa} = 2(\\sigma_{y0} + R) $$\n$$ \\sigma_{y0} + R = \\frac{540\\ \\mathrm{MPa}}{2} = 270\\ \\mathrm{MPa} $$\n\nThe isotropic hardening component $R$ is the increase in this radius over the initial value $\\sigma_{y0} = 200\\ \\mathrm{MPa}$:\n$$ R = (270\\ \\mathrm{MPa}) - \\sigma_{y0} = 270\\ \\mathrm{MPa} - 200\\ \\mathrm{MPa} = 70\\ \\mathrm{MPa} $$\nThe derived values are $\\alpha = 160\\ \\mathrm{MPa}$ and $R = 70\\ \\mathrm{MPa}$.\n\n**Evaluation of Options**\n\nA. The Bauschinger effect is correctly described as early yielding upon load reversal, as evidenced by $|\\sigma_{c}^{\\mathrm{rev}}| = 110\\ \\mathrm{MPa}  \\sigma_{y0} = 200\\ \\mathrm{MPa}$. The procedure for separating elastic and plastic strains, $\\varepsilon^{p} = \\varepsilon - \\sigma/E$, is the direct application of the model's fundamental assumptions. Defining yield points as the departure from linear elastic slope is the correct experimental and theoretical procedure. The relations for tensile and compressive yield limits are correctly identified. The subsequent calculation yields $\\alpha = \\frac{1}{2}(430 - 110)\\ \\mathrm{MPa} = 160\\ \\mathrm{MPa}$ and $\\sigma_{y0} + R = \\frac{1}{2}(430 - (-110))\\ \\mathrm{MPa} = 270\\ \\mathrm{MPa}$, which gives $R = 270\\ \\mathrm{MPa} - 200\\ \\mathrm{MPa} = 70\\ \\mathrm{MPa}$. The option's formulas and values are entirely correct. **Correct**.\n\nB. The Bauschinger effect is incorrectly described as *increasing* the magnitude of reverse yield. This contradicts experimental facts and the provided data, where $|\\sigma_{c}^{\\mathrm{rev}}|  \\sigma_{y0}$. The proposed formulas for the hardening variables are incorrect. The formula given for $\\alpha$, which is $\\alpha = \\tfrac{1}{2}\\left(\\sigma_{t}^{\\mathrm{rev}} - \\sigma_{c}^{\\mathrm{rev}}\\right)$, actually calculates the current yield radius $\\sigma_{y0}+R$. The formula for $R$, derived from $R = \\tfrac{1}{2}\\left(\\sigma_{t}^{\\mathrm{rev}} + \\sigma_{c}^{\\mathrm{rev}}\\right) - \\sigma_{y0}$, uses the expression for $\\alpha$ as if it were the radius. The formulas are swapped and misidentified, leading to incorrect values of $\\alpha = 270\\ \\mathrm{MPa}$ and $R = -40\\ \\mathrm{MPa}$. **Incorrect**.\n\nC. The claim that the Bauschinger effect is \"irrelevant when there is nonzero elastic unloading\" is fundamentally false; the effect is observable precisely *after* unloading and upon reloading in the reverse direction. The assertion that the area of the hysteresis loop equals \"kinematic hardening energy\" is physically unfounded. The loop area represents the plastic work dissipated as heat, $W_p = \\oint \\sigma d\\varepsilon^p$. The procedures to calculate $\\alpha$ and $R$ from the loop area, width, and height are ad hoc and have no basis in plasticity theory. **Incorrect**.\n\nD. The Bauschinger effect does not \"appear only after the stress passes through zero.\" It is a state-dependent property of the material resulting from prior plastic strain, which manifests as soon as reverse loading begins. The claim that the backstress $\\alpha$ equals the stress at reversal ($\\sigma = 100\\ \\mathrm{MPa}$) is arbitrary and incorrect; the stress at which unloading begins is an experimenter's choice and has no direct physical relation to the internal variable $\\alpha$. This incorrect assumption leads to a wrong value for $\\alpha$ and consequently for $R$. **Incorrect**.\n\nE. The description of the Bauschinger effect as a \"reduced reverse yield magnitude\" is correct. However, the statement that elastic and plastic strains must be separated by integrating the unloading path \"without using $E$\" is nonsensical and contradicts the definition of linear elasticity, $\\varepsilon^e = \\sigma/E$. The calculation for $\\alpha$ as the half-sum of reverse yield stresses is correct and gives $\\alpha = 160\\ \\mathrm{MPa}$. However, the statement that isotropic hardening $R$ is \"the initial yield stress itself\" ($R = 200\\ \\mathrm{MPa}$) confuses the hardening variable with the initial material property $\\sigma_{y0}$.

The problem is declared valid.\n\n(a) Derivation of Stabilized Stress Amplitude\n\nA stabilized, symmetric, strain-controlled cycle is characterized by the condition that all state variables are periodic, with a sign reversal after each half-cycle due to the symmetric loading $\\varepsilon \\in [-\\varepsilon_a, \\varepsilon_a]$. At the strain extrema, we have:\nAt $\\varepsilon = \\varepsilon_a$: $\\sigma = \\sigma_a$, $\\alpha = \\alpha_a$, $\\varepsilon^p = \\varepsilon^p_a$.\nAt $\\varepsilon = -\\varepsilon_a$: $\\sigma = -\\sigma_a$, $\\alpha = -\\alpha_a$, $\\varepsilon^p = -\\varepsilon^p_a$.\n\nAt these reversal points, the material is at a state of plastic flow. The von Mises yield condition, $|\\sigma - \\alpha| = \\sigma_y$, must hold.\nAt the tensile peak ($\\sigma_a$, $\\alpha_a$): $\\sigma_a - \\alpha_a = \\sigma_y$.\nAt the compressive peak ($-\\sigma_a$, $-\\alpha_a$): $(-\\sigma_a) - (-\\alpha_a) = -\\sigma_y$, which is equivalent to $\\sigma_a - \\alpha_a = \\sigma_y$.\nThus, we have our first relation:\n$$ \\sigma_a = \\sigma_y + \\alpha_a $$\n\nNext, we analyze the evolution of the backstress $\\alpha$ over a half-cycle, for instance, the tensile loading path from $\\varepsilon = -\\varepsilon_a$ to $\\varepsilon = \\varepsilon_a$. During this path, the plastic strain $\\varepsilon^p$ increases from $-\\varepsilon^p_a$ to $\\varepsilon^p_a$, so $\\mathrm{d}\\varepsilon^p > 0$. The accumulated plastic strain increment is $\\mathrm{d}p = |\\mathrm{d}\\varepsilon^p| = \\mathrm{d}\\varepsilon^p$. The Armstrong-Frederick hardening law becomes:\n$$ \\frac{\\mathrm{d}\\alpha}{\\mathrm{d}\\varepsilon^p} = C - \\gamma \\alpha $$\nThis is a first-order linear ordinary differential equation for $\\alpha(\\varepsilon^p)$. We integrate it over the tensile half-cycle, where $\\alpha$ evolves from $-\\alpha_a$ to $\\alpha_a$ as $\\varepsilon^p$ evolves from $-\\varepsilon^p_a$ to $\\varepsilon^p_a$. The change in plastic strain over the half-cycle is $\\Delta\\varepsilon^p = \\varepsilon^p_a - (-\\varepsilon^p_a) = 2\\varepsilon^p_a$.\n$$ \\int_{-\\alpha_a}^{\\alpha_a} \\frac{\\mathrm{d}\\alpha}{C - \\gamma \\alpha} = \\int_{-\\varepsilon^p_a}^{\\varepsilon^p_a} \\mathrm{d}\\varepsilon^p = 2\\varepsilon^p_a $$\nThe integral on the left yields:\n$$ \\left[ -\\frac{1}{\\gamma} \\ln(C - \\gamma \\alpha) \\right]_{-\\alpha_a}^{\\alpha_a} = -\\frac{1}{\\gamma} \\left( \\ln(C - \\gamma \\alpha_a) - \\ln(C + \\gamma \\alpha_a) \\right) = \\frac{1}{\\gamma} \\ln\\left(\\frac{C + \\gamma \\alpha_a}{C - \\gamma \\alpha_a}\\right) $$\nFor plastic flow to occur with positive hardening, we must have $d\\sigma/d\\varepsilon > 0$, which implies $d\\alpha/d\\varepsilon^p > 0$, so $C - \\gamma\\alpha > 0$, or $\\alpha  C/\\gamma$. This condition is met as $\\alpha$ saturates at a value less than $C/\\gamma$.\nEquating the two expressions for the integral:\n$$ \\frac{1}{\\gamma} \\ln\\left(\\frac{C + \\gamma \\alpha_a}{C - \\gamma \\alpha_a}\\right) = 2\\varepsilon^p_a \\implies \\frac{C + \\gamma \\alpha_a}{C - \\gamma \\alpha_a} = \\exp(2\\gamma\\varepsilon^p_a) $$\nSolving for $\\alpha_a$:\n$$ C + \\gamma \\alpha_a = (C - \\gamma \\alpha_a)\\exp(2\\gamma\\varepsilon^p_a) $$\n$$ \\alpha_a \\gamma (1 + \\exp(2\\gamma\\varepsilon^p_a)) = C (\\exp(2\\gamma\\varepsilon^p_a) - 1) $$\n$$ \\alpha_a = \\frac{C}{\\gamma} \\frac{\\exp(2\\gamma\\varepsilon^p_a) - 1}{\\exp(2\\gamma\\varepsilon^p_a) + 1} = \\frac{C}{\\gamma} \\tanh(\\gamma\\varepsilon^p_a) $$\nThis is the second relation, connecting backstress amplitude $\\alpha_a$ to plastic strain amplitude $\\varepsilon^p_a$.\n\nThe third relation comes from the additive decomposition of strain at the tensile peak:\n$$ \\varepsilon_a = \\varepsilon^e_a + \\varepsilon^p_a $$\nUsing linear elasticity, $\\varepsilon^e_a = \\sigma_a/E$.\n$$ \\varepsilon_a = \\frac{\\sigma_a}{E} + \\varepsilon^p_a $$\n\nWe now have a system of three equations for the three unknowns $\\sigma_a$, $\\alpha_a$, and $\\varepsilon^p_a$. By substitution, we derive a single nonlinear equation for $\\varepsilon^p_a$:\n$$ \\varepsilon_a = \\frac{\\sigma_y + \\alpha_a}{E} + \\varepsilon^p_a = \\frac{\\sigma_y}{E} + \\frac{1}{E}\\left(\\frac{C}{\\gamma}\\tanh(\\gamma\\varepsilon^p_a)\\right) + \\varepsilon^p_a $$\n$$ \\varepsilon_a - \\frac{\\sigma_y}{E} = \\varepsilon^p_a + \\frac{C}{E\\gamma}\\tanh(\\gamma\\varepsilon^p_a) $$\nWe solve this equation numerically for $\\varepsilon^p_a$ using the given parameters: $E = 210000\\,\\mathrm{MPa}$, $\\sigma_y = 350\\,\\mathrm{MPa}$, $C = 50000\\,\\mathrm{MPa}$, $\\gamma = 80$, and $\\varepsilon_a = 0.006$.\n$$ \\frac{\\sigma_y}{E} = \\frac{350}{210000} = \\frac{1}{600} \\approx 0.001667 $$\n$$ \\frac{C}{E\\gamma} = \\frac{50000}{210000 \\times 80} = \\frac{5}{168} \\approx 0.029762 $$\nThe equation is:\n$$ 0.006 - \\frac{1}{600} = \\varepsilon^p_a + \\frac{5}{168}\\tanh(80\\varepsilon^p_a) \\implies 0.004333\\dots = \\varepsilon^p_a + 0.029762\\tanh(80\\varepsilon^p_a) $$\nSolving this numerically yields $\\varepsilon^p_a \\approx 0.00351748$.\nUsing this value, we compute the other quantities:\n$$ \\alpha_a = \\frac{50000}{80}\\tanh(80 \\times 0.00351748) = 625\\tanh(0.2813984) \\approx 171.378\\,\\mathrm{MPa} $$\n$$ \\sigma_a = \\sigma_y + \\alpha_a = 350 + 171.378 = 521.378\\,\\mathrm{MPa} $$\nThe stabilized stress loop width is $\\Delta\\sigma = 2\\sigma_a$.\n$$ \\Delta\\sigma = 2 \\times 521.378 = 1042.756\\,\\mathrm{MPa} $$\nRounding to four significant figures, $\\Delta\\sigma = 1043\\,\\mathrm{MPa}$.\n\n(b) Mean Stress Relaxation\n\nWe now analyze the evolution of mean stress $\\sigma_m(N)$ with cycle number $N$. The mean stress is coupled to the mean backstress: $\\sigma_m = \\alpha_m$. We must therefore determine the evolution of $\\alpha_m$ on a cycle-by-cycle basis. We track the values of the backstress at the compressive reversal points, $\\alpha_{min}^{(N)}$, from cycle $N$ to $N+1$.\nThe evolution of backstress over a tensile half-cycle from $(\\alpha_{min}^{(N)})$ to $(\\alpha_{max}^{(N)})$ and a compressive half-cycle from $(\\alpha_{max}^{(N)})$ to $(\\alpha_{min}^{(N+1)})$ is governed by:\n$$ C - \\gamma\\alpha_{max}^{(N)} = (C - \\gamma\\alpha_{min}^{(N)})\\exp(-\\gamma \\Delta p_{tens}) $$\n$$ C + \\gamma\\alpha_{min}^{(N+1)} = (C + \\gamma\\alpha_{max}^{(N)})\\exp(-\\gamma \\Delta p_{comp}) $$\nTo linearize the evolution, we assume that for small mean stresses, the plastic strain range per half-cycle remains approximately constant and equal to its value in the stabilized symmetric loop, i.e., $\\Delta p_{tens} \\approx \\Delta p_{comp} \\approx 2\\varepsilon^p_a$.\nLet $X = \\exp(-2\\gamma\\varepsilon^p_a)$. The equations become:\n$$ C - \\gamma\\alpha_{max}^{(N)} = (C - \\gamma\\alpha_{min}^{(N)}) X $$\n$$ C + \\gamma\\alpha_{min}^{(N+1)} = (C + \\gamma\\alpha_{max}^{(N)}) X $$\nFrom the first equation, we express $\\alpha_{max}^{(N)}$:\n$$ \\gamma\\alpha_{max}^{(N)} = C(1-X) + \\gamma\\alpha_{min}^{(N)}X $$\nSubstituting this into the second equation:\n$$ C + \\gamma\\alpha_{min}^{(N+1)} = \\left[ C + C(1-X) + \\gamma\\alpha_{min}^{(N)}X \\right] X $$\n$$ C + \\gamma\\alpha_{min}^{(N+1)} = \\left[ C(2-X) + \\gamma\\alpha_{min}^{(N)}X \\right] X = C(2X-X^2) + \\gamma\\alpha_{min}^{(N)}X^2 $$\n$$ \\gamma\\alpha_{min}^{(N+1)} = C(2X-X^2-1) + \\gamma\\alpha_{min}^{(N)}X^2 = -C(1-X)^2 + \\gamma\\alpha_{min}^{(N)}X^2 $$\nThis is a linear recurrence relation for $\\alpha_{min}^{(N)}$. The fixed point is $\\alpha_{min}^{*} = -\\frac{C}{\\gamma}\\frac{(1-X)^2}{1-X^2} = -\\frac{C}{\\gamma}\\frac{1-X}{1+X} = -\\frac{C}{\\gamma}\\tanh(\\gamma\\varepsilon_a^p) = -\\alpha_a$.\nLet $\\delta\\alpha_{min}^{(N)} = \\alpha_{min}^{(N)} - \\alpha_{min}^{*} = \\alpha_{min}^{(N)} + \\alpha_a$. The recurrence for the deviation is:\n$$ \\delta\\alpha_{min}^{(N+1)} = \\delta\\alpha_{min}^{(N)} X^2 $$\nThe mean backstress is $\\alpha_m = (\\alpha_{min}+\\alpha_{max})/2$. From the yield conditions, $\\sigma_{min} - \\alpha_{min} = -\\sigma_y$ and $\\sigma_{max} - \\alpha_{max} = \\sigma_y$, we find $2\\sigma_m = \\alpha_{min}+\\alpha_{max} = 2\\alpha_m$.\nUsing the relation for $\\alpha_{max}^{(N)}$, we find $\\alpha_m^{(N)}$:\n$$ \\alpha_m^{(N)} = \\frac{1}{2}(\\alpha_{min}^{(N)} + \\alpha_{max}^{(N)}) = \\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\alpha_{min}^{(N)} + \\frac{C}{\\gamma}(1-X) + \\alpha_{min}^{(N)}X\\right) = \\frac{1+X}{2}\\alpha_{min}^{(N)} + \\frac{C}{2\\gamma}(1-X) $$\nThis shows a linear relationship between $\\alpha_m^{(N)}$ and $\\alpha_{min}^{(N)}$. Thus, the deviation of the mean backstress, $\\delta\\alpha_m^{(N)} = \\alpha_m^{(N)} - 0$, must also decay with the same factor $X^2$ per cycle.\n$$ \\alpha_m^{(N+1)} = \\alpha_m^{(N)} X^2 = \\alpha_m^{(N)} (\\exp(-2\\gamma\\varepsilon^p_a))^2 = \\alpha_m^{(N)} \\exp(-4\\gamma\\varepsilon^p_a) $$\nThe mean stress evolution is therefore:\n$$ \\sigma_m(N) = \\sigma_m(0) (\\exp(-4\\gamma\\varepsilon^p_a))^N = \\sigma_m(0) \\exp(-4\\gamma\\varepsilon^p_a N) $$\nBy comparison with the specified form $\\sigma_m(N) = \\sigma_m(0) \\exp(-rN)$, we identify the decay constant $r$:\n$$ r = 4\\gamma\\varepsilon^p_a $$\nUsing the numerical values $\\gamma=80$ and $\\varepsilon^p_a \\approx 0.00351748$:\n$$ r = 4 \\times 80 \\times 0.00351748 = 320 \\times 0.00351748 \\approx 1.12559 $$\nRounding to four significant figures, $r = 1.126$. This quantity is dimensionless per cycle.\n\nThe final answers are $\\Delta\\sigma = 1043\\,\\mathrm{MPa}$ and $r=1.126$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n1043  1.126\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "2867524"}]}
