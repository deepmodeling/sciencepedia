It is scientifically sound, internally consistent, and contains all necessary definitions and conditions for its resolution. The validity is confirmed, and I will proceed with the derivation.\n\nThe fundamental relationship is the plastic flow rule, which dictates that the plastic strain increment, $\\Delta\\varepsilon^{p}$, is normal to the surface of the plastic potential, $g$:\n$$\n\\Delta\\varepsilon^{p} = \\Delta\\lambda \\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial \\sigma}\n$$\nwhere $\\Delta\\lambda \\ge 0$ is the plastic multiplier and $\\sigma$ is the Cauchy stress tensor. The plastic potential $g$ is given as a function of the stress invariants $p$ and $q$, so $g = g(p(\\sigma), q(\\sigma))$.

The hydrostatic pressure is $p = -\\frac{1}{3}\\mathrm{tr}(\\sigma)$. Its derivative is:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial \\sigma} = -\\frac{1}{3}\\mathbf{I}\n$$\nwhere $\\mathbf{I}$ is the second-order identity tensor.\nThe deviatoric stress invariant is $q = \\sqrt{\\frac{3}{2}}\\|\\mathrm{dev}\\,\\sigma\\|$, where $\\mathbf{s} = \\mathrm{dev}\\,\\sigma = \\sigma + p\\mathbf{I}$. A more direct approach is to differentiate $q^2 = \\frac{3}{2}\\mathbf{s}:\\mathbf{s}$:\n$$\n2q\\frac{\\partial q}{\\partial \\sigma} = \\frac{3}{2} \\frac{\\partial (\\mathbf{s}:\\mathbf{s})}{\\partial \\sigma} = \\frac{3}{2} \\left(2\\mathbf{s} : \\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{s}}{\\partial \\sigma}\\right) = 3\\mathbf{s}:\\frac{\\partial(\\sigma - \\frac{1}{3}\\mathrm{tr}(\\sigma)\\mathbf{I})}{\\partial \\sigma}\n$$\nThe derivative $\\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{s}}{\\partial \\sigma}$ is the fourth-order deviatoric projection tensor, $\\mathbb{P}_{\\mathrm{dev}}$. The contraction of a deviatoric tensor $\\mathbf{s}$ with this projection tensor yields the tensor itself, $\\mathbf{s}:\\mathbb{P}_{\\mathrm{dev}} = \\mathbf{s}$.

The plastic volumetric strain increment, $\\Delta\\varepsilon_v^p = \\mathrm{tr}(\\Delta\\varepsilon^p)$, is found by taking the trace of the expression above:\n$$\n\\Delta\\varepsilon_{v}^{p} = \\mathrm{tr}\\left[\\Delta\\lambda \\left( \\frac{1}{3}M_{g}(\\psi)\\mathbf{I} + \\frac{3}{2q}\\mathbf{s} \\right)\\right] = \\Delta\\lambda \\left( \\frac{1}{3}M_{g}(\\psi)\\mathrm{tr}(\\mathbf{I}) + \\frac{3}{2q}\\mathrm{tr}(\\mathbf{s}) \\right)\n$$\nUsing the identities $\\mathrm{tr}(\\mathbf{I})=3$ and the definition $\\mathrm{tr}(\\mathbf{s})=0$, this simplifies to:\n$$\n\\Delta\\varepsilon_{v}^{p} = \\Delta\\lambda \\left( \\frac{1}{3}M_{g}(\\psi) \\cdot 3 + 0 \\right) = \\Delta\\lambda M_{g}(\\psi)\n$$\nNext, we calculate the von Mises equivalent plastic shear strain increment, $\\Delta\\varepsilon_s^p = \\sqrt{\\frac{2}{3}}\\|\\mathrm{dev}\\,\\Delta\\varepsilon^p\\|$. First, the deviatoric part of $\\Delta\\varepsilon^p$ is:\n$$\n\\mathrm{dev}(\\Delta\\varepsilon^p) = \\mathrm{dev}\\left[ \\Delta\\lambda \\left( \\frac{1}{3}M_{g}(\\psi)\\mathbf{I} + \\frac{3}{2q}\\mathbf{s} \\right) \\right] = \\Delta\\lambda \\left( \\mathrm{dev}\\left(\\frac{1}{3}M_{g}(\\psi)\\mathbf{I}\\right) + \\mathrm{dev}\\left(\\frac{3}{2q}\\mathbf{s}\\right) \\right)\n$$\nThe deviator of an isotropic tensor is zero ($\\mathrm{dev}(c\\mathbf{I})=\\mathbf{0}$), and the deviator of a deviatoric tensor is the tensor itself ($\\mathrm{dev}(\\mathbf{s})=\\mathbf{s}$). This gives:\n$$\n\\mathrm{dev}(\\Delta\\varepsilon^p) = \\Delta\\lambda \\left( \\mathbf{0} + \\frac{3}{2q}\\mathbf{s} \\right) = \\Delta\\lambda \\frac{3}{2q}\\mathbf{s}\n$$\nNow, we find its Frobenius norm:\n$$\n\\|\\mathrm{dev}(\\Delta\\varepsilon^p)\\| = \\left\\| \\Delta\\lambda \\frac{3}{2q}\\mathbf{s} \\right\\| = \\Delta\\lambda \\frac{3}{2q} \\|\\mathbf{s}\\|\n$$\nFrom the definition $q = \\sqrt{\\frac{3}{2}}\\|\\mathbf{s}\\|$, we have $\\|\\mathbf{s}\\| = q\\sqrt{\\frac{2}{3}}$.

Assuming a plastic increment requires $\\Delta\\lambda  0$, we can cancel this term:\n$$\n\\frac{\\Delta\\varepsilon_{v}^{p}}{\\Delta\\varepsilon_{s}^{p}} = \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda M_{g}(\\psi)}{\\Delta\\lambda} = M_{g}(\\psi)\n$$\nThe problem provides the expression $M_{g}(\\psi) = \\dfrac{6\\sin\\psi}{3-\\sin\\psi}$. Therefore, the ratio is:\n$$\n\\frac{\\Delta\\varepsilon_{v}^{p}}{\\Delta\\varepsilon_{s}^{p}} = \\frac{6\\sin\\psi}{3-\\sin\\psi}\n$$\nWe analyze the limiting cases as requested.\nFor the case of zero dilatancy, $\\psi \\to 0$:\n$$\n\\lim_{\\psi \\to 0} \\frac{6\\sin\\psi}{3-\\sin\\psi} = \\frac{6\\sin(0)}{3-\\sin(0)} = \\frac{0}{3} = 0\n$$\nThis signifies isochoric (volume-preserving) plastic flow, as expected.\nFor the associated flow case, $\\psi \\to \\phi$, where the plastic potential has the same form as the yield criterion:\n$$\n\\frac{\\Delta\\varepsilon_{v}^{p}}{\\Delta\\varepsilon_{s}^{p}} \\to \\frac{6\\sin\\phi}{3-\\sin\\phi}\n$$\nThis expression is $M(\\phi)$, the slope of the Mohr-Coulomb yield surface in the $(p,q)$-plane under triaxial compression.

The operator $\\mathbb{C}^{ep}$ possesses major symmetry, i.e., $\\mathbb{C}^{ep}_{ijkl} = \\mathbb{C}^{ep}_{klij}$, if and only if the correction term is symmetric. The elastic stiffness $\\mathbb{C}^{e}$ is symmetric. The correction term is $\\frac{(\\mathbb{C}^e : R_g) \\otimes (\\mathbb{C}^e : R_f)}{H_{ep}}$. This term is symmetric if the tensors $\\mathbb{C}^e : R_g$ and $\\mathbb{C}^e : R_f$ are proportional.\nWe have $\\mathbb{C}^e : R_f = \\sqrt{6}GN + \\beta K \\mathbb{I}$ and $\\mathbb{C}^e : R_g = \\sqrt{6}GN + \\beta_g K \\mathbb{I}$. These two second-order tensors are proportional if and only if their coefficients for the linearly independent basis tensors $N$ and $\\mathbb{I}$ are proportional. This requires $\\beta K = \\beta_g K$. Since $K0$, this implies $\\beta = \\beta_g$.\nThis corresponds to the associated flow rule, where $g$ is identical to $f$ (up to an arbitrary constant, so $R_f = R_g$). The antisymmetry indicator $A$ (and thus $a$) is zero if and only if $\\beta = \\beta_g$, assuming the denominator is non-zero. This provides an analytical confirmation for the condition of symmetry. The condition for $\\mathbb{C}^{ep}$ to be symmetric is $\\beta = \\beta_g$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{3\\sqrt{2} K (\\beta - \\beta_{g})}{3G + \\beta \\beta_{g} K}}$$", "id": "2867078"}]}
