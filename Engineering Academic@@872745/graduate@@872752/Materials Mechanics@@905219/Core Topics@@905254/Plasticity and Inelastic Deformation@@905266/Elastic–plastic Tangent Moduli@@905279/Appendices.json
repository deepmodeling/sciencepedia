A rigorous solution will be developed from the specified first principles.\n\nWe begin by establishing the constitutive framework.\nThe total strain $\\varepsilon$ is the sum of the elastic strain $\\varepsilon^e$ and the plastic strain $\\varepsilon^p$:\n$$ \\varepsilon = \\varepsilon^e + \\varepsilon^p $$\nIn rate (or incremental) form, this is:\n$$ d\\varepsilon = d\\varepsilon^e + d\\varepsilon^p $$\nThe stress $\\sigma$ is related to the elastic strain by Hooke's law:\n$$ \\sigma = E \\varepsilon^e \\implies d\\sigma = E d\\varepsilon^e $$\nThe yield condition for uniaxial tension with linear isotropic hardening states that plastic flow occurs when the stress $\\sigma$ reaches the current yield strength $\\sigma_Y$. The yield strength evolves from its initial value $\\sigma_y$ as a function of the accumulated plastic strain, which in this uniaxial case is simply $\\varepsilon^p$. The yield function $f$ is given by:\n$$ f(\\sigma, \\varepsilon^p) = |\\sigma| - \\sigma_Y = 0 $$\nwhere $\\sigma_Y = \\sigma_y + H\\varepsilon^p$. For monotonic tension, $\\sigma > 0$, so we write:\n$$ f(\\sigma, \\varepsilon^p) = \\sigma - (\\sigma_y + H\\varepsilon^p) = 0 $$\nDuring plastic loading, the state must remain on the yield surface, which implies the consistency condition $df = 0$:\n$$ df = \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial \\sigma} d\\sigma + \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial \\varepsilon^p} d\\varepsilon^p = 0 $$\nFrom the yield function, we compute the partial derivatives:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial \\sigma} = 1 $$\n$$ \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial \\varepsilon^p} = -H $$\nSubstituting these into the consistency condition gives:\n$$ d\\sigma - H d\\varepsilon^p = 0 \\implies d\\varepsilon^p = \\frac{d\\sigma}{H} $$\nThis result is consistent with the associative flow rule, where the plastic strain increment is normal to the yield surface, $d\\varepsilon^p = d\\lambda \\, \\partial f / \\partial \\sigma = d\\lambda$, making the plastic multiplier increment $d\\lambda = d\\sigma/H$.\n\nNow, we derive the elastic–plastic tangent modulus, $E^{\\text{ep}} = d\\sigma/d\\varepsilon$. We combine the incremental relations:\n$$ d\\varepsilon = d\\varepsilon^e + d\\varepsilon^p $$\nSubstitute $d\\varepsilon^e = d\\sigma/E$ and $d\\varepsilon^p = d\\sigma/H$:\n$$ d\\varepsilon = \\frac{d\\sigma}{E} + \\frac{d\\sigma}{H} = d\\sigma \\left( \\frac{1}{E} + \\frac{1}{H} \\right) = d\\sigma \\left( \\frac{E+H}{EH} \\right) $$\nSolving for the ratio $d\\sigma/d\\varepsilon$:\n$$ E^{\\text{ep}} = \\frac{d\\sigma}{d\\varepsilon} = \\left( \\frac{E+H}{EH} \\right)^{-1} = \\frac{EH}{E+H} $$\nThis is the expression for the uniaxial elastic–plastic tangent modulus. It is a constant for the given model.\n\nNext, we calculate the stress $\\sigma$ and the moduli at the total strain $\\varepsilon = 0.005$.\nFirst, we find the strain at first yield, $\\varepsilon_y$:\n$$ \\varepsilon_y = \\frac{\\sigma_y}{E} = \\frac{300 \\times 10^6 \\text{ Pa}}{210 \\times 10^9 \\text{ Pa}} = \\frac{1}{700} \\approx 0.0014286 $$\nSince $\\varepsilon = 0.005 > \\varepsilon_y$, the material is in the plastic regime. The stress-strain relation in this regime is linear with slope $E^{\\text{ep}}$. The equation of this line, starting from the point $(\\varepsilon_y, \\sigma_y)$, is:\n$$ \\sigma = \\sigma_y + E^{\\text{ep}} (\\varepsilon - \\varepsilon_y) $$\nWe use consistent units of GPa for moduli and stress. Thus, $\\sigma_y = 0.3$ GPa, $E = 210$ GPa, $H = 1$ GPa.\nFirst, compute $E^{\\text{ep}}$:\n$$ E^{\\text{ep}} = \\frac{(210)(1)}{210+1} = \\frac{210}{211} \\text{ GPa} $$\nNow compute the stress $\\sigma$ at $\\varepsilon = 0.005$:\n$$ \\sigma = 0.3 + \\frac{210}{211} \\left( 0.005 - \\frac{1}{700} \\right) = 0.3 + \\frac{210}{211} \\left( \\frac{5}{1000} - \\frac{1}{700} \\right) $$\n$$ \\sigma = 0.3 + \\frac{210}{211} \\left( \\frac{35 - 10}{7000} \\right) = 0.3 + \\frac{210}{211} \\left( \\frac{25}{7000} \\right) = 0.3 + \\frac{5250}{1477000} $$\nTo avoid intermediate rounding, we proceed symbolically:\n$$ \\sigma = \\sigma_y + \\frac{EH}{E+H} \\left( \\varepsilon - \\frac{\\sigma_y}{E} \\right) = \\frac{\\sigma_y(E+H) + EH\\varepsilon - H\\sigma_y}{E+H} = \\frac{E\\sigma_y + EH\\varepsilon}{E+H} = \\frac{E(\\sigma_y + H\\varepsilon)}{E+H} $$\nSubstituting numerical values:\n$$ \\sigma = \\frac{210 (0.3 + 1 \\times 0.005)}{210+1} = \\frac{210(0.305)}{211} = \\frac{64.05}{211} \\text{ GPa} $$\n$$ \\sigma \\approx 0.3035545 \\text{ GPa} $$\nThe secant modulus $E^{\\text{sec}}$ is defined as $\\sigma/\\varepsilon$:\n$$ E^{\\text{sec}} = \\frac{\\sigma}{\\varepsilon} = \\frac{64.05/211}{0.005} = \\frac{64.05}{211 \\times 0.005} = \\frac{64.05}{1.055} \\text{ GPa} $$\n$$ E^{\\text{sec}} \\approx 60.7109 \\text{ GPa} $$\nThe values for the final answer rounded to four significant figures are:\n- $E^{\\text{ep}} = \\frac{210}{211} \\text{ GPa} \\approx 0.99526 \\text{ GPa} \\to 0.9953 \\text{ GPa}$.\n- $E^{\\text{sec}} \\approx 60.7109 \\text{ GPa} \\to 60.71 \\text{ GPa}$.\n\nFinally, we address which modulus better predicts the next small stress increment.\nThe incremental constitutive relation for continued plastic loading is, by definition, $d\\sigma = E^{\\text{ep}} d\\varepsilon$. For small but finite increments $\\Delta\\varepsilon$, this provides the first-order approximation $\\Delta\\sigma \\approx E^{\\text{ep}} \\Delta\\varepsilon$. The elastic–plastic tangent modulus $E^{\\text{ep}}$ is the derivative of the stress-strain curve, $\\sigma(\\varepsilon)$, at the current state. It therefore represents the instantaneous stiffness of the material at that point.\nThe secant modulus, $E^{\\text{sec}} = \\sigma/\\varepsilon$, represents the slope of a line from the origin $(0,0)$ to the current point $(\\varepsilon, \\sigma)$ on the stress-strain curve. It is an average stiffness over the entire strain history from the initial state.\nThe stress-strain curve is non-linear (in fact, bi-linear). Using the secant modulus to predict a stress increment, $\\Delta\\sigma_{pred} = E^{\\text{sec}} \\Delta\\varepsilon$, would be equivalent to approximating the curve locally by a line passing through the origin. Since plastic deformation has significantly reduced the material's stiffness, $E^{\\text{ep}} \\ll E^{\\text{sec}}  E$. Consequently, the secant modulus would grossly overestimate the stress increment corresponding to a further small strain increment.\nTherefore, from first principles—the definition of a derivative as a local linear approximation—the elastic–plastic tangent modulus $E^{\\text{ep}}$ is the correct and superior predictor for the incremental stress response under continued plastic loading.\n\nThe final requested numerical values are $E^{\\text{sec}} = 60.71$ GPa and $E^{\\text{ep}} = 0.9953$ GPa.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n60.71  0.9953\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "2883001"}, {"introduction": "Material response under cyclic loading or strain path changes reveals complexities not seen in monotonic tension, such as the Bauschinger effect.

A solution will be provided.\n\n## Solution Derivation\n\nThe constitutive framework for one-dimensional, rate-independent plasticity with linear kinematic hardening is founded on the following set of equations. The total strain rate, $\\dot{\\varepsilon}$, is the sum of the elastic and plastic strain rates:\n$$\n\\dot{\\varepsilon} = \\dot{\\varepsilon}^e + \\dot{\\varepsilon}^p\n$$\nThe stress rate, $\\dot{\\sigma}$, is related to the elastic strain rate via Hooke's law:\n$$\n\\dot{\\sigma} = E \\dot{\\varepsilon}^e\n$$\nThe yield condition is defined by the function $f(\\sigma, \\alpha)$, where $\\sigma$ is the stress and $\\alpha$ is the backstress, which represents the center of the yield surface. For a uniaxial state with an initial yield stress of $\\sigma_{y0}$:\n$$\nf(\\sigma, \\alpha) = |\\sigma - \\alpha| - \\sigma_{y0} \\le 0\n$$\nPlastic flow occurs only when the stress state is on the yield surface, i.e., $f(\\sigma, \\alpha) = 0$. The plastic strain rate is given by an associative flow rule:\n$$\n\\dot{\\varepsilon}^p = \\dot{\\lambda} \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial \\sigma} = \\dot{\\lambda} \\, \\mathrm{sgn}(\\sigma-\\alpha)\n$$\nwhere $\\dot{\\lambda} \\ge 0$ is the plastic multiplier. The evolution of the backstress is governed by the linear kinematic hardening rule:\n$$\n\\dot{\\alpha} = H' \\dot{\\varepsilon}^p\n$$\nwhere $H'$ is the constant kinematic hardening modulus. The loading/unloading conditions (Kuhn-Tucker conditions) are $\\dot{\\lambda} \\ge 0$, $f \\le 0$, and $\\dot{\\lambda} f = 0$. When plastic flow is active, the stress state must remain on the yield surface, which imposes the consistency condition, $\\dot{f} = 0$.\n\n### Tangent Modulus for Unloading ($D_{\\mathrm{unload}}$)\nThe problem describes a state where the material has been loaded plastically in tension and the strain direction is then reversed. At the point of reversal, the stress state $(\\sigma, \\alpha)$ lies on the yield surface, satisfying $f(\\sigma, \\alpha) = 0$. An infinitesimal strain increment in the reverse direction ($\\dot{\\varepsilon}  0$) causes the stress to decrease, moving the stress state into the interior of the yield surface ($f  0$). According to the Kuhn-Tucker conditions, this means there is no plastic flow, so the plastic multiplier $\\dot{\\lambda}$ must be zero.\nWith $\\dot{\\lambda} = 0$, the plastic strain rate is zero:\n$$\n\\dot{\\varepsilon}^p = 0\n$$\nThe strain rate decomposition then simplifies to:\n$$\n\\dot{\\varepsilon} = \\dot{\\varepsilon}^e\n$$\nSubstituting this into Hooke's law gives the relationship between the total strain rate and the stress rate:\n$$\n\\dot{\\sigma} = E \\dot{\\varepsilon}^e = E \\dot{\\varepsilon}\n$$\nThe tangent modulus is defined as the coefficient relating the strain rate to the stress rate, $D = \\frac{\\dot{\\sigma}}{\\dot{\\varepsilon}}$. Therefore, the tangent modulus for immediate unloading is the Young's modulus:\n$$\nD_{\\mathrm{unload}} = E\n$$\nThis response is purely elastic.\n\n### Tangent Modulus for Reverse Plastic Flow ($E^{\\text{ep}}_{\\mathrm{reload}}$)\nAfter the initial elastic unloading, the stress continues to decrease until it reaches the yield surface on the opposite side. At this point, reverse plastic flow initiates. Let us assume the initial loading was in tension, so at the point of reversal, $\\sigma > \\alpha$. For reverse loading, the stress becomes compressive relative to the backstress, i.e., $\\sigma  \\alpha$. Thus, $\\mathrm{sgn}(\\sigma-\\alpha) = -1$.\nThe yield function during reverse plastic flow is:\n$$\nf(\\sigma, \\alpha) = -(\\sigma - \\alpha) - \\sigma_{y0} = 0\n$$\nThe associative flow rule gives:\n$$\n\\dot{\\varepsilon}^p = \\dot{\\lambda} \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial \\sigma} = \\dot{\\lambda}(-1) = -\\dot{\\lambda}\n$$\nThe hardening rule becomes:\n$$\n\\dot{\\alpha} = H' \\dot{\\varepsilon}^p = -H' \\dot{\\lambda}\n$$\nDuring active plastic flow, the consistency condition $\\dot{f}=0$ must hold:\n$$\n\\dot{f} = \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial \\sigma}\\dot{\\sigma} + \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial \\alpha}\\dot{\\alpha} = 0\n$$\nThe partial derivatives are $\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial \\sigma} = -1$ and $\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial \\alpha} = 1$. The consistency condition is therefore:\n$$\n(-1)\\dot{\\sigma} + (1)\\dot{\\alpha} = 0 \\implies \\dot{\\sigma} = \\dot{\\alpha}\n$$\nSubstituting the hardening rule, we find a relation for the stress rate in terms of the plastic multiplier:\n$$\n\\dot{\\sigma} = -H' \\dot{\\lambda} \\implies \\dot{\\lambda} = -\\frac{\\dot{\\sigma}}{H'}\n$$\nNote that since $\\dot{\\sigma}$ will be negative during compressive loading and $H' > 0$, we have $\\dot{\\lambda} > 0$ as required.\n\nNow, we combine these relations. The stress rate is given by Hooke's law applied to the elastic part of the strain:\n$$\n\\dot{\\sigma} = E \\dot{\\varepsilon}^e = E(\\dot{\\varepsilon} - \\dot{\\varepsilon}^p)\n$$\nSubstituting $\\dot{\\varepsilon}^p = -\\dot{\\lambda}$ gives:\n$$\n\\dot{\\sigma} = E(\\dot{\\varepsilon} + \\dot{\\lambda})\n$$\nNow substitute the expression for $\\dot{\\lambda}$ from the consistency condition:\n$$\n\\dot{\\sigma} = E\\left(\\dot{\\varepsilon} - \\frac{\\dot{\\sigma}}{H'}\\right)\n$$\nWe now solve for $\\dot{\\sigma}$ in terms of $\\dot{\\varepsilon}$:\n$$\n\\dot{\\sigma} = E\\dot{\\varepsilon} - \\frac{E}{H'}\\dot{\\sigma}\n$$\n$$\n\\dot{\\sigma}\\left(1 + \\frac{E}{H'}\\right) = E\\dot{\\varepsilon}\n$$\n$$\n\\dot{\\sigma}\\left(\\frac{H' + E}{H'}\\right) = E\\dot{\\varepsilon}\n$$\n$$\n\\dot{\\sigma} = \\left(\\frac{E H'}{E + H'}\\right)\\dot{\\varepsilon}\n$$\nThe elastic–plastic tangent modulus for reloading, $E^{\\text{ep}}_{\\mathrm{reload}}$, is the coefficient of $\\dot{\\varepsilon}$. This is also known as the consistent tangent modulus for this one-dimensional problem.\n$$\nE^{\\text{ep}}_{\\mathrm{reload}} = \\frac{E H'}{E + H'}\n$$\nThis expression is independent of the amount of prior plastic strain, as required by the problem statement.

This quantity, denoted $\\lambda_{\\min}^{*}$, determines the onset of material localization via the loss of strong ellipticity condition.\n\nThe problem is validated and deemed to be scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. All necessary data, definitions, and mathematical relations are provided. The analysis follows established principles of continuum mechanics, specifically regarding material stability. I shall proceed with a complete solution.\n\nThe core of the problem is to compute $\\lambda_{\\min}^{*} = \\min_{n \\in \\mathcal{N}} \\lambda_{\\min}\\big(Q(n)\\big)$. This task can be decomposed into three primary steps:\n1.  For each given $6 \\times 6$ Voigt stiffness matrix $C^{\\text{ep},V}$, construct the corresponding fourth-order tangent modulus tensor $C^{\\text{ep}}_{ikjl}$.\n2.  Define the discrete set of unit direction vectors $\\mathcal{N}$ over which the minimization will be performed.\n3.  For each direction $n \\in \\mathcal{N}$, assemble the acoustic tensor $Q(n)$ and find its smallest eigenvalue, $\\lambda_{\\min}(Q(n))$. The overall minimum across all directions is the desired result $\\lambda_{\\min}^{*}$.\n\n**Step 1: Construction of the Fourth-Order Tangent Modulus Tensor**\n\nThe acoustic tensor for a direction $n$ is defined by $Q_{ij}(n) = n_{k} C^{\\text{ep}}_{ikjl} n_{l}$, where summation is implied over repeated indices $k,l \\in \\{1,2,3\\}$. The components of the fourth-order tensor $C^{\\text{ep}}$ must be derived from the provided $6 \\times 6$ Voigt matrix $C^{\\text{ep},V}$. The problem provides a specific, albeit non-standard, mapping rule that must be followed strictly.\n\nThe components are given by the formula:\n$$\nC^{\\text{ep}}_{ikjl} = \\frac{C^{\\text{ep},V}_{I J}}{s_{I} \\, s_{J}}\n$$\nHere, $I$ and $J$ are the Voigt indices corresponding to the tensor index pairs $(i,k)$ and $(j,l)$, respectively. The shear factor vector is $s = [1,1,1,2,2,2]$. The Voigt index mapping, based on the problem description and using $1$-based indices for clarity, is established as follows:\n- Normal components: $1 \\leftrightarrow (1,1)$, $2 \\leftrightarrow (2,2)$, $3 \\leftrightarrow (3,3)$\n- Shear components (symmetric): $4 \\leftrightarrow (2,3) \\text{ or } (3,2)$, $5 \\leftrightarrow (1,3) \\text{ or } (3,1)$, $6 \\leftrightarrow (1,2) \\text{ or } (2,1)$.\n\nFor implementation, we use $0$-based indices. The mapping from a tensor index pair $(i,k)$ (with $i,k \\in \\{0,1,2\\}$) to a Voigt index $I \\in \\{0,1,2,3,4,5\\}$ is implemented via a lookup function or a pre-computed map. Since $C^{\\text{ep},V}$ is symmetric and the index mapping is symmetric with respect to its arguments (e.g., the pair $(i,k)$ maps to the same Voigt index as $(k,i)$), the resulting acoustic tensor $Q(n)$ will be symmetric, ensuring real eigenvalues.\n\nA four-dimensional array representing $C^{\\text{ep}}_{ikjl}$ will be constructed once for each test case. For each set of indices $(i,k,j,l)$, the corresponding Voigt indices $I$ and $J$ are determined, and the tensor component is computed using the given formula.\n\n**Step 2: Definition of the Direction Set**\n\nThe search for the minimum eigenvalue is performed over a discrete set of directions $\\mathcal{N}$. This set is formed by normalizing all non-zero vectors with integer components in $\\{-1, 0, 1\\}$.\nThe set of un-normalized vectors is $\\mathcal{S} = \\{ (a,b,c) \\in \\{-1,0,1\\}^{3} \\setminus \\{(0,0,0)\\} \\}$. This set contains $3^3 - 1 = 26$ vectors.\nThe set of normalized directions is then $\\mathcal{N} = \\left\\{ \\frac{s}{\\lVert s \\rVert_{2}} : s \\in \\mathcal{S} \\right\\}$.\nThe algorithm will iterate through each of these $26$ distinct directions. Although $Q(n)=Q(-n)$, which introduces redundancy, the small size of the set makes explicit iteration over all $26$ directions computationally trivial and robust.\n\n**Step 3: Computation of the Minimum Eigenvalue**\n\nFor each test case and for each direction $n \\in \\mathcal{N}$, the following sequence is executed:\na. The $3 \\times 3$ acoustic tensor $Q(n)$ is assembled. Its components $Q_{ij}$ are computed by contracting the pre-computed fourth-order tensor $C^{\\text{ep}}$ with the direction vector $n$:\n$$\nQ_{ij}(n) = \\sum_{k=0}^{2} \\sum_{l=0}^{2} n_k C^{\\text{ep}}_{ikjl} n_l\n$$\nThis operation is efficiently performed using Einstein summation, for instance, via `numpy.einsum`.\n\nb. The eigenvalues of the symmetric matrix $Q(n)$ are calculated. The smallest of these is $\\lambda_{\\min}(Q(n))$.\n\nc. A running minimum, initialized to a large value, is updated with $\\lambda_{\\min}(Q(n))$. After iterating through all $n \\in \\mathcal{N}$, this running minimum holds the value of $\\lambda_{\\min}^{*}$.\n\nThe procedure is repeated for each of the three provided $C^{\\text{ep},V}$ matrices. For case 1 (isotropic material), the Lamé parameters $\\lambda$ and $\\mu$ must first be calculated from the given Young's modulus $E = 210$ GPa and Poisson's ratio $\\nu = 0.3$.\n- $\\mu = \\frac{E}{2(1+\\nu)} = \\frac{210}{2(1.3)} \\approx 80.769231$ GPa\n- $\\lambda = \\frac{E \\nu}{(1+\\nu)(1-2\\nu)} = \\frac{210 \\cdot 0.3}{(1.3)(0.4)} \\approx 121.153846$ GPa\n\nThe final results are rounded to six decimal places as required.", "answer": "```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom itertools import product\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Computes the minimum eigenvalue of the acoustic tensor over a discrete set of directions\n    for three given elastic-plastic tangent stiffness matrices in Voigt form.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # --- Step 1: Define Test Cases and Constants ---\n\n    # Case 1: Isotropic elastic material\n    E = 210.0  # GPa\n    nu = 0.3\n    mu = E / (2 * (1 + nu))\n    lmbda = (E * nu) / ((1 + nu) * (1 - 2 * nu))\n    \n    C_ep_V1 = np.zeros((6, 6))\n    C_ep_V1[0, 0] = C_ep_V1[1, 1] = C_ep_V1[2, 2] = lmbda + 2 * mu\n    C_ep_V1[0, 1] = C_ep_V1[0, 2] = C_ep_V1[1, 2] = lmbda\n    C_ep_V1[1, 0] = C_ep_V1[2, 0] = C_ep_V1[2, 1] = lmbda\n    C_ep_V1[3, 3] = C_ep_V1[4, 4] = C_ep_V1[5, 5] = mu\n\n    # Case 2: Anisotropic stable material\n    C_ep_V2 = np.array([\n        [180, 70, 60, 0, 0, 0],\n        [70, 160, 50, 0, 0, 0],\n        [60, 50, 140, 0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 45, 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 35, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 25]\n    ], dtype=float)\n\n    # Case 3: Anisotropic near-localization material\n    C_ep_V3 = np.array([\n        [180, 70, 60, 0, 0, 0],\n        [70, 160, 50, 0, 0, 0],\n        [60, 50, 140, 0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 45, 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 35, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, -2]\n    ], dtype=float)\n\n    test_cases = [C_ep_V1, C_ep_V2, C_ep_V3]\n\n    # Shear factor vector for engineering shear strain\n    s_factors = np.array([1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2], dtype=float)\n\n    # --- Step 2: Define Discrete Set of Directions ---\n    S = [vec for vec in product([-1, 0, 1], repeat=3) if not all(v == 0 for v in vec)]\n    N_directions = [np.array(s_vec) / np.linalg.norm(s_vec) for s_vec in S]\n\n    # --- Step 3: Helper function for Voigt index mapping ---\n    voigt_map = np.array([[0, 5, 4], [5, 1, 3], [4, 3, 2]], dtype=int)\n    def get_voigt_index(i, k):\n        # Maps a pair of 0-based tensor indices to a 0-based Voigt index.\n        # The mapping is symmetric: (i,k) maps identically to (k,i).\n        return voigt_map[i, k]\n\n    results = []\n    \n    # --- Step 4: Main computation loop for each test case ---\n    for C_voigt in test_cases:\n        # Construct the 3x3x3x3 fourth-order tensor C_ikjl\n        C_tensor = np.zeros((3, 3, 3, 3))\n        for i, k, j, l in product(range(3), repeat=4):\n            I = get_voigt_index(i, k)\n            J = get_voigt_index(j, l)\n            C_tensor[i, k, j, l] = C_voigt[I, J] / (s_factors[I] * s_factors[J])\n\n        lambda_star_min = float('inf')\n\n        # Find min eigenvalue over all directions\n        for n in N_directions:\n            # Construct the 3x3 acoustic tensor Q(n)\n            # Q_ij = n_k * C_ikjl * n_l\n            Q_n = np.einsum('k,ikjl,l-ij', n, C_tensor, n)\n            \n            # Find the minimum eigenvalue of Q(n)\n            # eigvalsh is used for symmetric matrices\n            min_eig_n = np.linalg.eigvalsh(Q_n).min()\n            \n            # Update the overall minimum\n            if min_eig_n  lambda_star_min:\n                lambda_star_min = min_eig_n\n        \n        results.append(lambda_star_min)\n        \n    # --- Step 5: Format and print the final output ---\n    formatted_results = [f\"{r:.6f}\" for r in results]\n    print(f\"[{','.join(formatted_results)}]\")\n\nsolve()\n```", "id": "2883031"}]}
