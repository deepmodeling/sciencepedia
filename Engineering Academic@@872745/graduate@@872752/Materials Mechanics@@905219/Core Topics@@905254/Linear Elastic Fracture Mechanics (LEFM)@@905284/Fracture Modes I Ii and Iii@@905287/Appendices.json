It represents a canonical problem in Linear Elastic Fracture Mechanics (LEFM) and admits a unique, analytical solution. We will proceed with the derivation.\n\nThe problem requires the derivation of the Mode I stress intensity factor, $K_I$, for an infinite plate with a central crack of length $2a$ subjected to a remote uniaxial tensile stress $\\sigma$. The solution will be developed using the Westergaard complex potential method, which is particularly effective for Mode I crack problems.\n\nIn two-dimensional linear elasticity, the stress field can be expressed in terms of a complex analytic function, the Westergaard stress function $Z(z)$, where $z = x + iy$. The stress components are given by:\n$$ \\sigma_{xx} = \\text{Re}[Z(z)] - y \\, \\text{Im}[Z'(z)] $$\n$$ \\sigma_{yy} = \\text{Re}[Z(z)] + y \\, \\text{Im}[Z'(z)] $$\n$$ \\tau_{xy} = -y \\, \\text{Re}[Z'(z)] $$\nwhere $Z'(z)$ is the derivative of $Z(z)$ with respect to $z$.\n\nFor a crack lying on the x-axis from $x=-a$ to $x=a$ in an infinite plate subjected to a remote biaxial tensile stress $\\sigma$ (i.e., $\\sigma_{xx}^{\\infty} = \\sigma$ and $\\sigma_{yy}^{\\infty} = \\sigma$), an appropriate stress function is:\n$$ Z(z) = \\frac{\\sigma z}{\\sqrt{z^2 - a^2}} $$\nWe must verify that this function satisfies the boundary conditions.\nFirst, consider the far-field behavior as $|z| \\to \\infty$. The term $\\sqrt{z^2 - a^2} = z\\sqrt{1 - a^2/z^2} \\approx z(1 - \\frac{1}{2} \\frac{a^2}{z^2}) \\approx z$. Thus, $Z(z) \\to \\frac{\\sigma z}{z} = \\sigma$. As $|z| \\to \\infty$, $y \\, \\text{Im}[Z'(z)]$ and $y \\, \\text{Re}[Z'(z)]$ both tend to zero, so the stresses become $\\sigma_{xx} \\to \\text{Re}[\\sigma] = \\sigma$ and $\\sigma_{yy} \\to \\text{Re}[\\sigma] = \\sigma$. This confirms the remote biaxial stress field.\n\nSecond, consider the crack faces. The crack faces are defined by $y=0$ for $|x|  a$. The traction vector on these surfaces has components $\\sigma_{yy}$ and $\\tau_{xy}$. At $y=0$, the stress expressions simplify to $\\sigma_{yy} = \\text{Re}[Z(x)]$ and $\\tau_{xy} = 0$. For $|x|  a$, the argument of the square root, $x^2 - a^2$, is negative. Therefore, $\\sqrt{x^2 - a^2} = i\\sqrt{a^2 - x^2}$. The stress function on the crack faces becomes:\n$$ Z(x) = \\frac{\\sigma x}{i\\sqrt{a^2 - x^2}} = -i \\frac{\\sigma x}{\\sqrt{a^2 - x^2}} $$\nThis is a purely imaginary number, so its real part is zero: $\\text{Re}[Z(x)] = 0$. Consequently, $\\sigma_{yy} = 0$ on the crack faces. As $\\tau_{xy}$ is also zero, the crack faces are traction-free, as required.\n\nThe problem, however, specifies a remote *uniaxial* stress $\\sigma_{yy}^{\\infty} = \\sigma$, with $\\sigma_{xx}^{\\infty} = 0$. We can obtain this state by superposing a uniform, non-singular stress field of $\\sigma_{xx} = -\\sigma$ onto the biaxial solution. The principle of superposition is valid in linear elasticity. This added constant stress field does not generate any tractions on the horizontal crack faces and does not introduce any singularities. Therefore, the singular part of the stress field near the crack tips, which defines the stress intensity factor, is solely determined by the original Westergaard function $Z(z)$.\n\nThe stress intensity factor $K_I$ is defined by the amplitude of the singular stress field near the crack tip. Let us analyze the field near the right crack tip at $z=a$. We introduce a local polar coordinate system $(r, \\theta)$ centered at the tip, such that $z-a = re^{i\\theta}$. For small $r$, we can approximate the term $z^2-a^2$:\n$$ z^2 - a^2 = (z-a)(z+a) = (re^{i\\theta})(2a + re^{i\\theta}) \\approx 2are^{i\\theta} $$\nSubstituting this into the stress function $Z(z)$, and approximating $z \\approx a$ in the numerator, we find the asymptotic form of $Z(z)$ as $z \\to a$:\n$$ Z(z) \\approx \\frac{\\sigma a}{\\sqrt{2are^{i\\theta}}} = \\frac{\\sigma \\sqrt{a}}{\\sqrt{2r}} e^{-i\\theta/2} $$\nThe definition of the Mode I stress intensity factor relates it to the stress component $\\sigma_{yy}$ directly ahead of the crack tip (i.e., at $\\theta=0$) via the relation:\n$$ \\sigma_{yy}(r, \\theta=0) = \\frac{K_I}{\\sqrt{2\\pi r}} \\quad \\text{as } r \\to 0 $$\nWe now compute the stress $\\sigma_{yy}$ from our Westergaard function in this region. Ahead of the crack tip, we have $y=0$ and $x  a$. This corresponds to $\\theta = 0$ in our local coordinate system. For $y=0$, we have $\\sigma_{yy} = \\text{Re}[Z(x)]$. Using the asymptotic form of $Z(z)$ with $\\theta=0$:\n$$ Z(z)|_{\\theta=0} \\approx \\frac{\\sigma \\sqrt{a}}{\\sqrt{2r}} $$\nThis expression is purely real, so $\\sigma_{yy}(r, \\theta=0) = \\text{Re}[Z] \\approx \\frac{\\sigma \\sqrt{a}}{\\sqrt{2r}}$.\nBy equating the general definition of the singular stress field with the result derived from our specific stress function, we have:\n$$ \\frac{K_I}{\\sqrt{2\\pi r}} = \\frac{\\sigma \\sqrt{a}}{\\sqrt{2r}} $$\nSolving for $K_I$ yields the final expression:\n$$ K_I = \\sigma \\sqrt{\\pi a} $$\nThis result gives the mode I stress intensity factor in terms of the remote stress $\\sigma$ and half the crack length $a$.

Therefore, the problem is deemed valid and a full solution can be constructed.\n\nThe solution proceeds by, first, computing the hydrostatic stress for pure Mode I loading, then for pure Mode II loading, and finally, taking their difference. The hydrostatic stress, $\\sigma_m$, is defined as one-third of the trace of the stress tensor, $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}$. In a $3$D Cartesian or polar-cylindrical coordinate system, this is $\\sigma_m = \\frac{1}{3}(\\sigma_{11} + \\sigma_{22} + \\sigma_{33})$. In polar coordinates $(r, \\theta, z)$, this is $\\sigma_m = \\frac{1}{3}(\\sigma_{rr} + \\sigma_{\\theta\\theta} + \\sigma_{zz})$.\n\nWe are given the condition of plane strain, which stipulates that the strain in the out-of-plane direction is zero, i.e., $\\varepsilon_{zz}=0$. From the constitutive equations of linear isotropic elasticity (Generalized Hooke's Law), the strain $\\varepsilon_{zz}$ is related to the stress components by:\n$$ \\varepsilon_{zz} = \\frac{1}{E} \\left[ \\sigma_{zz} - \\nu (\\sigma_{xx} + \\sigma_{yy}) \\right] $$\nwhere $E$ is Young's modulus. The sum of the in-plane normal stresses is an invariant under coordinate rotation, so $\\sigma_{xx} + \\sigma_{yy} = \\sigma_{rr} + \\sigma_{\\theta\\theta}$.

The out-of-plane stress $\\sigma_{zz}^{(II)}$ is thus:\n$$ \\sigma_{zz}^{(II)}(r, 0) = \\nu \\left[ \\sigma_{rr}^{(II)}(r, 0) + \\sigma_{\\theta\\theta}^{(II)}(r, 0) \\right] = \\nu (0+0) = 0 $$\nThe hydrostatic stress for Mode II at $\\theta=0$ is:\n$$ \\sigma_{m}^{(II)}(r, 0) = \\frac{1}{3} \\left[ \\sigma_{rr}^{(II)}(r, 0) + \\sigma_{\\theta\\theta}^{(II)}(r, 0) + \\sigma_{zz}^{(II)}(r, 0) \\right] = \\frac{1}{3}(0+0+0) = 0 $$\nA more profound result is that the sum of the in-plane normal stresses for Mode II, $\\sigma_{rr}^{(II)} + \\sigma_{\\theta\\theta}^{(II)}$, is identically zero for all angles $\\theta$. This implies that under plane strain, $\\sigma_{zz}^{(II)}$ is also identically zero, and thus the hydrostatic stress $\\sigma_{m}^{(II)}$ is zero everywhere within the LEFM singular field.\n\nFinally, we compute the required difference, $\\Delta \\sigma_{m}(r)$:\n$$ \\Delta \\sigma_{m}(r) = \\sigma_{m}^{(I)}(r, 0) - \\sigma_{m}^{(II)}(r, 0) = \\frac{2(1+\\nu)}{3} \\frac{K_{I}}{\\sqrt{2 \\pi r}} - 0 $$\n$$ \\Delta \\sigma_{m}(r) = \\frac{2(1+\\nu) K_{I}}{3\\sqrt{2 \\pi r}} $$\n\nBased on this derivation, we can assert that for a positive Mode I stress intensity factor ($K_I>0$), which corresponds to an opening crack, the hydrostatic stress ahead of the tip is large and positive (tensile). In contrast, the hydrostatic stress for Mode II loading under plane strain is zero. Thus, Mode I loading generates a significantly larger hydrostatic stress on the forward ray.\n\nThe implication for ductile fracture in metals is profound. The growth of microscopic voids, a key mechanism in ductile fracture, is driven by hydrostatic tension. The high hydrostatic stress (often quantified by stress triaxiality, $\\sigma_m/\\sigma_e$, where $\\sigma_e$ is the equivalent stress) generated under Mode I loading strongly promotes void growth and subsequent coalescence, leading to crack extension. The absence of hydrostatic stress in Mode II (for plane strain) means it is far less effective at driving this failure mechanism. This is a primary reason why Mode I is generally considered the most critical and damaging loading mode for fracture in engineering structures made of ductile materials.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\frac{2(1+\\nu)K_{I}}{3\\sqrt{2\\pi r}}}\n$$", "id": "2887566"}]}
