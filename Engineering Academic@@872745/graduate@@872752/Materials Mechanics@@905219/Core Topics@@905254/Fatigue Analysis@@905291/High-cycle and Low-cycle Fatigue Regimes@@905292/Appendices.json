The effective residual stress is modeled as an average over a near-surface region, weighted by an exponential influence function $w(z) = (1/L)\\exp(-z/L)$, where $L$ is the influence depth. The total effective mean stress, $\\sigma_{m,\\mathrm{eff}}$, is the sum of the applied mean stress, $\\sigma_m$, and this averaged residual stress:\n$$\n\\sigma_{m,\\mathrm{eff}} = \\sigma_{m} + \\int_{0}^{\\infty} w(z)\\,\\sigma_{\\mathrm{res}}(z)\\,dz\n$$\nWe evaluate the integral:\n$$\n\\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{L} e^{-z/L} \\left(-\\sigma_{r0} e^{-z/\\alpha}\\right) dz = -\\frac{\\sigma_{r0}}{L} \\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\exp\\left(-z\\left(\\frac{1}{\\alpha} + \\frac{1}{L}\\right)\\right) dz\n$$\nThe integral of $\\exp(-ax)$ from $0$ to $\\infty$ is $1/a$. Here, the coefficient in the exponent is $a = \\frac{1}{\\alpha} + \\frac{1}{L} = \\frac{L+\\alpha}{\\alpha L}$. Thus, the integral evaluates to $\\frac{\\alpha L}{\\alpha+L}$. The contribution from the residual stress is therefore:\n$$\n-\\frac{\\sigma_{r0}}{L} \\left( \\frac{\\alpha L}{\\alpha+L} \\right) = -\\sigma_{r0} \\frac{\\alpha}{\\alpha+L}\n$$\nThe effective mean stress is then given by:\n$$\n\\sigma_{m,\\mathrm{eff}} = \\sigma_{m} - \\sigma_{r0} \\frac{\\alpha}{\\alpha+L}\n$$\n\nNext, we establish the load-side Smith–Watson–Topper (SWT) parameter, $P_{\\mathrm{load}}$. This parameter is defined as the product of the maximum effective stress, $\\sigma_{\\max,\\mathrm{eff}}$, and the total strain amplitude, $\\varepsilon_{a}$. The maximum effective stress is the sum of the effective mean stress and the applied stress amplitude, $\\sigma_{a}$:\n$$\n\\sigma_{\\max,\\mathrm{eff}} = \\sigma_{m,\\mathrm{eff}} + \\sigma_{a}\n$$\nThe total strain amplitude, $\\varepsilon_{a}$, is the sum of its elastic and plastic parts, $\\varepsilon_{e,a}$ and $\\varepsilon_{p,a}$, which are given by Hooke's law and the cyclic Ramberg–Osgood relation, respectively:\n$$\n\\varepsilon_{a} = \\varepsilon_{e,a} + \\varepsilon_{p,a} = \\frac{\\sigma_{a}}{E} + \\left(\\frac{\\sigma_{a}}{K'}\\right)^{1/n'}\n$$\nwhere $E$ is the elastic modulus, $K'$ is the cyclic strength coefficient, and $n'$ is the cyclic strain hardening exponent. Combining these expressions, the load-side parameter is:\n$$\nP_{\\mathrm{load}} = \\sigma_{\\max,\\mathrm{eff}} \\cdot \\varepsilon_{a} = \\left(\\sigma_{m} - \\sigma_{r0} \\frac{\\alpha}{\\alpha+L} + \\sigma_{a}\\right) \\left(\\frac{\\sigma_{a}}{E} + \\left(\\frac{\\sigma_{a}}{K'}\\right)^{1/n'}\\right)\n$$\nThis parameter represents the severity of the applied loading condition.\n\nNow, we derive the material-side SWT parameter, $P_{\\mathrm{mat}}(N)$, which quantifies the material's resistance to fatigue as a function of the number of cycles to failure, $N$. The SWT model postulates that failure occurs when the load-side parameter equals the material-side parameter for a given life. The material-side parameter is established from fully-reversed ($\\sigma_m = 0$) loading conditions. Its value for a life of $N$ cycles is determined using the total strain–life relation (Manson–Coffin–Basquin):\n$$\n\\varepsilon_{a}(N) = \\frac{\\sigma'_{f}}{E}(2N)^{b} + \\varepsilon'_{f}(2N)^{c}\n$$\nwhere $\\sigma'_f$ and $b$ are the fatigue strength coefficient and exponent, and $\\varepsilon'_f$ and $c$ are the fatigue ductility coefficient and exponent. The term $2N$ represents the number of reversals to failure. For the material side, the maximum stress $\\sigma_{\\max}$ corresponds to the stress amplitude $\\sigma_a$. The stress amplitude corresponding to a life $N$ is given by the elastic term of the strain-life relation (Basquin's law):\n$$\n\\sigma_{a}(N) = \\sigma'_{f}(2N)^{b}\n$$\nThus, $P_{\\mathrm{mat}}(N)$ is the product of this stress amplitude and the total strain amplitude at life $N$:\n$$\nP_{\\mathrm{mat}}(N) = \\sigma_{a}(N) \\cdot \\varepsilon_{a}(N) = \\left(\\sigma'_{f}(2N)^{b}\\right) \\left(\\frac{\\sigma'_{f}}{E}(2N)^{b} + \\varepsilon'_{f}(2N)^{c}\\right)\n$$\nExpanding this gives the final expression for the material's resistance:\n$$\nP_{\\mathrm{mat}}(N) = \\frac{(\\sigma'_{f})^2}{E}(2N)^{2b} + \\sigma'_{f}\\varepsilon'_{f}(2N)^{b+c}\n$$\n\nThe core of the life prediction is solving the nonlinear scalar equation $P_{\\mathrm{mat}}(N) = P_{\\mathrm{load}}$ for $N$:\n$$\n\\frac{(\\sigma'_{f})^2}{E}(2N)^{2b} + \\sigma'_{f}\\varepsilon'_{f}(2N)^{b+c} = \\left(\\sigma_{m} - \\sigma_{r0} \\frac{\\alpha}{\\alpha+L} + \\sigma_{a}\\right) \\left(\\frac{\\sigma_{a}}{E} + \\left(\\frac{\\sigma_{a}}{K'}\\right)^{1/n'}\\right)\n$$\nThe left-hand side is a monotonically decreasing function of $N$ since the exponents $b=-0.09$ and $c=-0.6$ are negative, ensuring $2b < 0$ and $b+c < 0$. The right-hand side is a constant for each given test case. This structure guarantees a unique, positive solution for $N$, which can be found using a numerical root-finding algorithm.\n\nFinally, the fatigue regime is classified based on the relative contributions of elastic and plastic strain to the total strain amplitude at the predicted life, $N$. The elastic strain amplitude component in the Manson-Coffin-Basquin equation is $\\varepsilon_{e,a}(N) = (\\sigma'_{f}/E)(2N)^b$, and the plastic component is $\\varepsilon_{p,a}(N) = \\varepsilon'_{f}(2N)^c$. The regime is declared high-cycle fatigue if the elastic strain component is dominant or equal, and low-cycle fatigue otherwise. The indicator variable $H$ is defined as:\n$$\nH=1 \\quad \\text{if} \\quad \\left(\\frac{\\sigma'_{f}}{E}\\right)(2N)^{b} \\ge \\varepsilon'_{f}(2N)^{c} \\quad \\text{(High-Cycle Fatigue)}\n$$\n$$\nH=0 \\quad \\text{if} \\quad \\left(\\frac{\\sigma'_{f}}{E}\\right)(2N)^{b} < \\varepsilon'_{f}(2N)^{c} \\quad \\text{(Low-Cycle Fatigue)}\n$$\n\nThe computational procedure for each test case is as follows:\n1. Define all material constants: $E=210000 \\ \\mathrm{MPa}$, $\\sigma'_{f}=1100 \\ \\mathrm{MPa}$, $b=-0.09$, $\\varepsilon'_{f}=0.5$, $c=-0.6$, $K'=1000 \\ \\mathrm{MPa}$, $n'=0.2$.\n2. For a given test case $(\\sigma_{a}, \\sigma_{m}, \\sigma_{r0}, \\alpha, L)$, calculate the constant $P_{\\mathrm{load}}$.\n3. Define the function $f(N) = P_{\\mathrm{mat}}(N) - P_{\\mathrm{load}}$.\n4. Numerically solve the equation $f(N)=0$ to find the cycles to failure $N$.\n5. Round $N$ to the nearest integer.\n6. Evaluate the high-cycle fatigue criterion at the calculated $N$ to determine the integer indicator $H$.\n7. Store the resulting pair $[N, H]$.\nThis procedure will be implemented for all specified test cases.", "answer": "```python\n# The complete and runnable Python 3 code goes here.\n# Imports must adhere to the specified execution environment.\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy.optimize import root_scalar\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves the fatigue life prediction problem for a suite of test cases.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Material constants (common to all test cases)\n    E = 210000.  # Elastic modulus in MPa\n    sig_f_prime = 1100.  # Fatigue strength coefficient in MPa\n    b = -0.09        # Fatigue strength exponent\n    eps_f_prime = 0.5    # Fatigue ductility coefficient (dimensionless)\n    c = -0.6         # Fatigue ductility exponent\n    K_prime = 1000.  # Cyclic strength coefficient in MPa\n    n_prime = 0.2    # Cyclic strain hardening exponent\n\n    # Test suite: each case is a tuple (sigma_a, sigma_m, sigma_r0, alpha, L)\n    # Units: (MPa, MPa, MPa, mm, mm)\n    test_cases = [\n        (250., 100., 200., 0.1, 0.05),  # Case A\n        (700., 200., 300., 0.1, 0.2),   # Case B\n        (250., 200., 300., 0.2, 0.2),   # Case C\n        (350., 50., 200., 0.05, 0.1),   # Case D\n    ]\n\n    results = []\n    \n    for case in test_cases:\n        sig_a, sig_m, sig_r0, alpha, L = case\n\n        # Step 1: Calculate the effective mean stress\n        sig_m_eff = sig_m - sig_r0 * (alpha / (alpha + L))\n\n        # Step 2: Calculate the load-side SWT parameter, P_load\n        sig_max_eff = sig_m_eff + sig_a\n        \n        # Total strain amplitude from Ramberg-Osgood\n        eps_a = (sig_a / E) + (sig_a / K_prime)**(1 / n_prime)\n        \n        P_load = sig_max_eff * eps_a\n\n        # Step 3: Define the function for the material-side SWT parameter, P_mat(N)\n        # We need to solve P_mat(N) - P_load = 0\n        def p_mat_func(N):\n            reversals = 2. * N\n            if reversals  1.: # Life must be at least half a cycle\n                reversals = 1.\n            \n            p_mat = ((sig_f_prime**2) / E) * (reversals)**(2 * b) + \\\n                    (sig_f_prime * eps_f_prime) * (reversals)**(b + c)\n            return p_mat - P_load\n\n        # Step 4: Solve for N using a numerical root-finder\n        # The equation is well-behaved and monotonic.
