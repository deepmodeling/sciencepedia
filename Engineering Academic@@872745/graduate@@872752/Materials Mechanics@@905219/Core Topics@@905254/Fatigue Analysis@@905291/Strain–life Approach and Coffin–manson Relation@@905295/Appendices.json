The results are then compared against theoretical expectations derived from the elastic branch of the strain–life curve, characterized by the exponent $b$.\n\nFirst, it is essential to establish the theoretical foundation. The elastic strain amplitude, $\\Delta\\epsilon_{e}/2$, is related to the reversals to failure, $2N_f$, by the Basquin relation:\n$$\n\\frac{\\Delta\\epsilon_{e}}{2} = \\frac{\\sigma'_f}{E} (2N_f)^b\n$$\nwhere $\\sigma'_f$ is the fatigue strength coefficient, $E$ is the modulus of elasticity, and $b$ is the fatigue strength exponent.\n\nThe Smith–Watson–Topper parameter, $P$, for fully reversed, uniaxial loading ($\\sigma_{mean} = 0$), is defined as the product of the maximum stress, $\\sigma_{max}$, and the strain amplitude, $\\Delta\\epsilon/2$.

After processing all cases, format the collected results into a single string representing a list of lists, as specified.\n\nThis procedure constitutes a complete and rigorous approach to solving the problem as stated.", "answer": "```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calibrates a power-law fatigue model for several datasets and reports\n    the results as specified in the problem statement.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Define the test cases from the problem statement.\n    test_cases = [\n        {\n            \"b\": -0.095,\n            \"data\": [\n                (1.881, 500), (1.389, 2000), (1.054, 10000),\n                (0.760, 50000), (0.608, 200000), (0.422, 1000000)\n            ]\n        },\n        {\n            \"b\": -0.08,\n            \"data\": [\n                (2.713, 1000), (0.898, 1000000)\n            ]\n        },\n        {\n            \"b\": -0.12,\n            \"data\": [\n                (2.133, 200), (1.540, 1000), (1.234, 5000),\n                (1.105, 20000), (0.814, 100000)\n            ]\n        },\n        {\n            \"b\": -0.06,\n            \"data\": [\n                (0.695, 5000000), (0.631, 10000000), (0.578, 20000000)\n            ]\n        }\n    ]\n\n    results = []\n    \n    for case in test_cases:\n        b = case[\"b\"]\n        data = np.array(case[\"data\"])\n        \n        P = data[:, 0]  # Smith–Watson–Topper parameter in MPa\n        Nf = data[:, 1] # Cycles to failure\n        \n        # Step 1: Define logarithmic variables\n        # x = ln(2 * N_f)\n        # y = ln(P)\n        x = np.log(2 * Nf)\n        y = np.log(P)\n        \n        n = float(len(x))\n        x_bar = np.mean(x)\n        y_bar = np.mean(y)\n        \n        # Step 2: Estimate slope b_P and intercept ln_P_f_prime\n        numerator = np.sum((x - x_bar) * (y - y_bar))\n        denominator = np.sum((x - x_bar)**2)\n        \n        b_P = numerator / denominator\n        ln_P_f_prime = y_bar - b_P * x_bar\n        \n        P_f_prime = np.exp(ln_P_f_prime)\n        \n        # Step 3: Compute RMSE_P in MPa\n        P_predicted = P_f_prime * (2 * Nf)**b_P\n        rmse_P = np.sqrt(np.mean((P - P_predicted)**2))\n        \n        # Step 4: Compute differences and the boolean flag\n        d1 = b_P - b\n        d2 = b_P - (2 * b)\n        c = bool(np.abs(d2) = 0.03)\n        \n        # Collect results for the current case\n        case_results = [b_P, d1, d2, rmse_P, c]\n        results.append(case_results)\n\n    # Final print statement in the exact required format.\n    # The string representation of a list of lists.\n    print(f\"[{','.join(map(str, results))}]\")\n\nsolve()\n```", "id": "2920101"}]}
