The framework is linear elastic fracture mechanics (LEFM), modified to account for short-crack behavior.\n\nThe fundamental tenet of LEFM for fatigue crack growth is that propagation occurs when the stress intensity factor range, $\\Delta K$, exceeds a material threshold, $\\Delta K_{\\mathrm{th}}$. In this problem, closure effects are accounted for by using an effective (closure-corrected) long-crack threshold, $\\Delta K_{\\mathrm{eff,th}}$. For a long crack of length $a$ in an infinite plate ($Y=1$), the threshold condition is:\n$$ \\Delta K_{\\mathrm{eff,th}} = \\Delta\\sigma_{\\mathrm{th,long}}(a)\\,\\sqrt{\\pi a} $$\nwhere $\\Delta\\sigma_{\\mathrm{th,long}}(a)$ is the threshold stress range for a long crack of length $a$. This equation predicts that as $a \\to 0$, the required stress for propagation, $\\Delta\\sigma_{\\mathrm{th,long}}(a)$, would approach infinity, which is physically incorrect. The threshold stress for a specimen with no crack (or a vanishingly small crack) must be finite and is given by the smooth-specimen fatigue limit, $\\Delta\\sigma_w$.\n\nTo resolve this inconsistency, we introduce an intrinsic material length, $a_0$, as proposed by El Haddad, Smith, and Topper. This parameter modifies the crack length term in the LEFM equation. The physical crack length $a$ is replaced by an effective crack length $(a+a_0)$. The unified threshold condition for a crack of any length $a$ is then postulated to be:\n$$ \\Delta K_{\\mathrm{eff,th}} = \\Delta\\sigma_{\\mathrm{th}}(a)\\,\\sqrt{\\pi (a+a_0)} $$\nHere, $\\Delta\\sigma_{\\mathrm{th}}(a)$ is the threshold stress range for a crack of length $a$. This single expression must satisfy two boundary conditions:\n$1$. For long cracks, where $a \\gg a_0$, we have $(a+a_0) \\approx a$.

The inputs $p_0$ (in $\\mathrm{MPa}$) and $a_w$ (in $\\mathrm{m}$) ensure that the resulting $K_{\\mathrm{op}}$ is in units of $\\mathrm{MPa}\\sqrt{\\mathrm{m}}$.\n\n**2. Calculation of the Minimum Element Size ($h_{\\min}$)**\n\nThe minimum element size, $h_{\\min}$, is based on resolving the Irwin plastic zone size, $r_p$. The size of this zone depends on the stress state, specified as either plane stress or plane strain.\n\nThe plastic zone radius, $r_p$, is given by:\n-   For plane stress: $r_p^{\\mathrm{(ps)}} = \\frac{1}{2\\pi} \\left(\\frac{K_{\\max}}{\\sigma_y}\\right)^2$\n-   For plane strain: $r_p^{\\mathrm{(pe)}} = \\frac{1}{6\\pi} \\left(\\frac{K_{\\max}}{\\sigma_y}\\right)^2$\n\nwhere $K_{\\max}$ is the maximum applied stress intensity factor and $\\sigma_y$ is the material's yield strength. Given the units of $K_{\\max}$ ($\\mathrm{MPa}\\sqrt{\\mathrm{m}}$) and $\\sigma_y$ ($\\mathrm{MPa}$), the ratio $(K_{\\max}/\\sigma_y)^2$ has units of $\\mathrm{m}$, and thus $r_p$ is calculated in meters.\n\nThe problem specifies a meshing rule where the plastic zone must be resolved by $N$ elements. The minimum element size along the crack face is then:\n$$\nh_{\\min} = \\frac{r_p}{N}\n$$\nWith the fixed value $N=10$, the formula is $h_{\\min} = r_p/10$. The resulting value of $h_{\\min}$ is in meters. To meet the output requirement, this value must be converted to millimeters by multiplying by $1000$:\n$$\nh_{\\min} \\,[\\mathrm{mm}] = \\left( \\frac{r_p \\,[\\mathrm{m}]}{10} \\right) \\times 1000\n$$\n\n**Computational Implementation**\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy.special import gamma\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Computes the crack opening SIF (K_op) and minimum element size (h_min)\n    for a suite of test cases based on principles of linear elastic fracture mechanics.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Test suite defined in the problem statement.\n    test_cases = [\n        {'id': 'A', 'p0': 50.0, 'aw': 1.0e-3, 'm': 1.5, 'Kmax': 20.0, 'sigma_y': 600.0, 'condition': 'plane strain'},\n        {'id': 'B', 'p0': 200.0, 'aw': 1.0e-5, 'm': 0.5, 'Kmax': 10.0, 'sigma_y': 300.0, 'condition': 'plane stress'},\n        {'id': 'C', 'p0': 80.0, 'aw': 5.0e-4, 'm': 5.0, 'Kmax': 30.0, 'sigma_y': 1000.0, 'condition': 'plane strain'},\n        {'id': 'D', 'p0': 120.0, 'aw': 2.0e-4, 'm': 2.0, 'Kmax': 2.0, 'sigma_y': 1500.0, 'condition': 'plane stress'},\n    ]\n    \n    # Number of elements across the plastic zone\n    N = 10\n\n    results = []\n    \n    for case in test_cases:\n        p0 = case['p0']\n        aw = case['aw']\n        m = case['m']\n        kmax = case['Kmax']\n        sigma_y = case['sigma_y']\n        condition = case['condition']\n        \n        # 1.
