Under strain control, because the cycle is symmetric and rate-independent with zero mean, the stabilized trajectory in the $\\sigma$–$\\varepsilon$ plane is closed over one period. The area enclosed is strictly positive, demonstrating nonzero plastic dissipation.

It describes a well-posed problem in the theory of plasticity, grounded in established experimental observations and theoretical models. The data provided are consistent and physically plausible. We may therefore proceed with the derivation of a solution.\n\nThe problem asks to decompose the material's hardening response into isotropic and kinematic components based on uniaxial tension-compression yield data. We use a one-dimensional model of combined isotropic-kinematic hardening. The yield function $f$ defines the elastic domain in stress space.
