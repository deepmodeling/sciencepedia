A solution will be formulated.\n\nThe task is to derive the expression for the Mode I fracture energy, $G_I$, by integrating the given traction-separation law, $t_n(\\delta_n)$, over the entire separation process. The definition provided is:\n$$G_I = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} t_n(\\delta_n)\\, \\mathrm{d}\\delta_n$$\nThe function $t_n(\\delta_n)$ is defined piecewise.

The derived expression, $G_I = \\frac{1}{3}\\sigma_c\\delta_c$, relates this energy to the two fundamental parameters of the cohesive law: the cohesive strength $\\sigma_c$ (the maximum stress the interface can withstand) and the critical separation $\\delta_c$ (the separation distance at which the interface fails completely). The product $\\sigma_c\\delta_c$ defines the area of a bounding rectangle for the traction-separation curve. The factor of $\\frac{1}{3}$ is a shape factor that arises directly from the quadratic nature of the specified cohesive law, which can be written as $t_n(\\delta_n) = \\sigma_c(1-\\delta_n/\\delta_c)^2$. For comparison, a simple linear (triangular) cohesive law yields a shape factor of $\\frac{1}{2}$. The initial slope of this law at $\\delta_n=0$ is $t_n'(0) = -2\\sigma_c/\\delta_c$, indicating immediate softening from the onset of separation, while the slope at complete failure, $t_n'(\\delta_c)=0$, is zero.

The corresponding interfacial interpenetration is $\\delta = \\sigma / K_{0} = -p_{\\max} / K_{0}$. The magnitude of this interpenetration is $|\\delta| = p_{\\max} / K_{0}$. The constraint requires this magnitude to not exceed $\\delta_{\\text{allow}}$:\n$$ |\\delta| = \\frac{p_{\\max}}{K_{0}} \\le \\delta_{\\text{allow}} $$\nThis inequality yields a lower bound on $K_{0}$:\n$$ K_{0} \\ge \\frac{p_{\\max}}{\\delta_{\\text{allow}}} $$\n\nConstraint 2: Artificial compliance limit.\nThe total compliance of the structure is $C_{\\text{total}} = d\\Delta/d\\sigma$. From the relation $\\Delta = \\sigma(L/E + 1/K_{0})$, we find:\n$$ C_{\\text{total}} = \\frac{L}{E} + \\frac{1}{K_{0}} $$\nThis total compliance is the sum of the bulk compliance, $C_{\\text{bulk}} = L/E$, and the compliance introduced by the interface, $C_{\\text{interface}} = 1/K_{0}$. The constraint states that the artificial compliance from the interface must not exceed a fraction $\\eta$ of the bulk compliance:\n$$ C_{\\text{interface}} \\le \\eta C_{\\text{bulk}} $$\nSubstituting the expressions for the compliances:\n$$ \\frac{1}{K_{0}} \\le \\eta \\frac{L}{E} $$\nThis gives a second lower bound on $K_{0}$:\n$$ K_{0} \\ge \\frac{E}{\\eta L} $$\nTo satisfy both constraints simultaneously, $K_{0}$ must be greater than or equal to both lower bounds. The minimal required cohesive stiffness is the maximum of these two bounds:\n$$ K_{0, \\text{min}} = \\max\\left(\\frac{p_{\\max}}{\\delta_{\\text{allow}}}, \\frac{E}{\\eta L}\\right) $$\nThe two constraints formalize the need for a sufficiently high cohesive stiffness $K_{0}$. A high $K_{0}$ ensures that under compressive loading, non-physical interpenetration is limited (Constraint 1), and that the overall structural response is not unduly softened by the presence of the interface, thus maintaining modeling fidelity to a nearly monolithic body (Constraint 2). The design task is to find the minimum $K_{0}$ that is \"stiff enough\" to satisfy both a performance criterion (interpenetration) and a modeling fidelity criterion (compliance).\n\nPart 3: Numerical Evaluation\n\nWe evaluate the minimal stiffness $K_{0, \\text{min}}$ and the corresponding sensitivity $S(K_{0, \\text{min}})$ using the numerical values: $L=0.50\\,\\text{m}$, $E=210\\,\\text{GPa}=210 \\times 10^{9}\\,\\text{Pa}$, $p_{\\max}=100\\,\\text{MPa}=100 \\times 10^{6}\\,\\text{Pa}$, $\\delta_{\\text{allow}}=1.0\\times 10^{-7}\\,\\text{m}$, and $\\eta=0.050$.\n\nFirst, we calculate the two lower bounds for $K_{0}$.\nFrom the interpenetration constraint:\n$$ K_{0,1} = \\frac{p_{\\max}}{\\delta_{\\text{allow}}} = \\frac{100 \\times 10^{6}\\,\\text{Pa}}{1.0 \\times 10^{-7}\\,\\text{m}} = 1.0 \\times 10^{15}\\,\\text{Pa}\\,\\text{m}^{-1} $$\nFrom the artificial compliance constraint:\n$$ K_{0,2} = \\frac{E}{\\eta L} = \\frac{210 \\times 10^{9}\\,\\text{Pa}}{0.050 \\times 0.50\\,\\text{m}} = \\frac{210 \\times 10^{9}\\,\\text{Pa}}{0.025\\,\\text{m}} = 8.4 \\times 10^{12}\\,\\text{Pa}\\,\\text{m}^{-1} $$\nThe minimal allowable stiffness is the maximum of these two values:\n$$ K_{0, \\text{min}} = \\max(1.0 \\times 10^{15}, 8.4 \\times 10^{12})\\,\\text{Pa}\\,\\text{m}^{-1} = 1.0 \\times 10^{15}\\,\\text{Pa}\\,\\text{m}^{-1} $$\nThe interpenetration constraint is the governing one.\n\nNow, we evaluate the sensitivity $S$ at this value of $K_{0, \\text{min}}$ using the derived expression $S(K_{0}) = (1 + K_{0}L/E)^{-1}$. First, calculate the dimensionless term in the denominator:\n$$ \\frac{K_{0, \\text{min}} L}{E} = \\frac{(1.0 \\times 10^{15}\\,\\text{Pa}\\,\\text{m}^{-1}) \\times (0.50\\,\\text{m})}{210 \\times 10^{9}\\,\\text{Pa}} = \\frac{0.5 \\times 10^{15}}{2.1 \\times 10^{11}} \\approx 2380.952 $$\nNow substitute this value into the sensitivity expression:\n$$ S(K_{0, \\text{min}}) = \\frac{1}{1 + 2380.952} = \\frac{1}{2381.952} \\approx 0.000419823 $$\nRounding to four significant figures, the sensitivity is $0.0004198$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{4.198 \\times 10^{-4}}$$", "id": "2871467"}, {"introduction": "A significant challenge in simulating fracture with local softening models is the pathological dependence of results on the finite element mesh size.

It represents a standard exercise in the computational modeling of material failure, specifically addressing the issue of mesh regularization in cohesive zone models. I will therefore proceed with the solution.\n\nFirst, let us address the origin of mesh-size dependence in local softening models. The fundamental issue arises from the interpretation of the constitutive law. In a standard continuum damage or plasticity model, the softening stress-strain curve, $\\sigma(\\varepsilon)$, is assumed to be a material property, independent of any discretization parameter like the finite element size $h$.\n\nWhen fracture localizes into a band of width $h$, the total energy dissipated in this band, $W_{diss}$, to create a new crack surface of area $A$ is the product of the energy density (energy per unit volume) and the volume of the localization band, $V = A h$. The energy density, $g$, is the area under the stress-strain curve, $g = \\int_{0}^{\\varepsilon_f} \\sigma(\\varepsilon) d\\varepsilon$, where $\\varepsilon_f$ is the strain at complete failure. Thus, $W_{diss} = g \\cdot (A h)$.\n\nThe fracture energy, $G_c$, is defined as the energy dissipated per unit area of the newly created crack surface. Therefore, $G_c = W_{diss} / A = g h$. Since $g$ is considered a material constant, this relationship shows that the calculated fracture energy $G_c$ is directly proportional to the mesh size $h$. As the mesh is refined ($h \\to 0$), the numerically predicted energy dissipation converges to zero. This is a non-physical result, as fracture is an energy-dissipative process with a finite, non-zero energy requirement. This pathological dependence on the discretization is known as mesh-size dependence.\n\nThe Cohesive Zone Model (CZM) presented in this problem resolves this issue through a specific form of regularization. Instead of defining a stress-strain law, it defines a traction-separation law, $T(\\delta)$, which governs the interface. The fracture energy $G_c$ is defined as an integral over the separation $\\delta$, making it an intrinsic material property. The link to the continuum is established via the relation $\\delta = \\varepsilon h$. This effectively makes the material's stress-strain response dependent on $h$, in such a way that the total dissipated energy remains constant.\n\nNow, we derive the expression for the complete decohesion separation, $\\delta_c$. The problem defines a triangular traction-separation law.\n\nLet us define the law piecewise.\nFor the initial linear elastic segment, where $0 \\le \\delta \\le \\delta_0$, the traction $T$ is given by:\n$$T(\\delta) = K_0 \\delta$$\nAt the separation $\\delta_0$, the traction reaches its peak value, $f_t$:\n$$f_t = T(\\delta_0) = K_0 \\delta_0$$\nFrom this, we can express the separation at peak traction, $\\delta_0$, as:\n$$\\delta_0 = \\frac{f_t}{K_0}$$\nFor the linear softening branch, where $\\delta_0  \\delta \\le \\delta_c$, the traction decreases linearly from $f_t$ at $\\delta_0$ to $0$ at $\\delta_c$. The equation of this line is:\n$$T(\\delta) = f_t \\left( \\frac{\\delta_c - \\delta}{\\delta_c - \\delta_0} \\right)$$\nThe problem states that the fracture energy, $G_c$, is defined as the area under the softening branch of this law. This corresponds to the area of a triangle with height $f_t$ and base $(\\delta_c - \\delta_0)$.\n$$G_c \\equiv \\int_{\\delta_0}^{\\delta_c} T(\\delta) d\\delta = \\frac{1}{2} (\\delta_c - \\delta_0) f_t$$\nWe are tasked to find $\\delta_c$.

Our goal is to express $\\delta_c$ solely in terms of the given independent parameters $h$, $f_t$, $G_c$, and $\\hat{K}$. To do this, we must substitute the expression for $\\delta_0$.\n\nWe previously established that $\\delta_0 = f_t / K_0$. The problem provides the regularization for the initial cohesive stiffness, $K_0$, as a function of the mesh size $h$ and a mesh-independent constant $\\hat{K}$:\n$$K_0 = \\frac{\\hat{K}}{h}$$\nSubstituting this regularization into the expression for $\\delta_0$:\n$$\\delta_0 = \\frac{f_t}{K_0} = \\frac{f_t}{(\\hat{K}/h)} = \\frac{f_t h}{\\hat{K}}$$\nNow, we substitute this mesh-dependent expression for $\\delta_0$ back into our equation for $\\delta_c$:\n$$\\delta_c(h) = \\frac{f_t h}{\\hat{K}} + \\frac{2 G_c}{f_t}$$\nThis is the final analytical expression for the complete decohesion separation $\\delta_c$ as a function of the specified parameters.
