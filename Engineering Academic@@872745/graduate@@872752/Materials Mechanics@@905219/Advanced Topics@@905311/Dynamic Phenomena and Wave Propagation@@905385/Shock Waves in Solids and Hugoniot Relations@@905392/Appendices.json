In this limit, the empirical relation $U_s = c_0 + s u_p$ shows that the shock speed approaches the intercept value:\n$$ \\lim_{u_p \\to 0} U_s = c_0 $$\nA shock of infinitesimally small amplitude is, by definition, an acoustic wave. Therefore, $c_0$ represents the speed of sound waves in the material under zero-pressure conditions.\n\nTo derive an expression for the bulk modulus $K$, we must relate the stress to the strain. The longitudinal strain across the shock is $\\epsilon_{xx} = 1 - \\frac{\\rho_0}{\\rho}$. From the mass conservation equation, $\\rho_0 U_s = \\rho (U_s - u_p)$, we find $\\frac{\\rho_0}{\\rho} = \\frac{U_s - u_p}{U_s} = 1 - \\frac{u_p}{U_s}$. Thus, the longitudinal strain is:\n$$ \\epsilon_{xx} = \\frac{u_p}{U_s} $$\nIn the context of shock physics, particularly at high pressures, it is a common and useful approximation to equate the longitudinal stress $\\sigma_{xx}$ with the hydrostatic pressure $P$. This is the hydrodynamic approximation, where shear stresses are considered negligible. The volumetric strain $\\theta$ is defined as $\\theta = 1 - V/V_0 = 1 - \\rho_0/\\rho$, which for one-dimensional strain is equal to the longitudinal strain, $\\theta=\\epsilon_{xx}$.\n\nThe adiabatic bulk modulus is defined as $K = \\rho \\left(\\frac{\\partial P}{\\partial \\rho}\\right)_S$. In the limit of small strains, this can be written as $K \\approx \\frac{P}{\\theta}$.

An isotropic linear elastic solid is characterized by two independent moduli, for instance, the bulk modulus $K$ and the shear modulus $\\mu$. Such a solid supports longitudinal waves (P-waves) and transverse waves (S-waves).\n\nA planar shock induces a state of one-dimensional strain. In the small-amplitude limit, this becomes a one-dimensional elastic wave, which is a longitudinal wave. Therefore, a more physically rigorous interpretation for a solid is that the experimentally measured zero-amplitude wave speed $c_0$ corresponds to the longitudinal wave speed $c_L$. The speed of longitudinal waves is given by $c_L = \\sqrt{\\frac{K + \\frac{4}{3}\\mu}{\\rho_0}}$.\n\nThe presence of a finite shear modulus ($\\mu  0$) provides additional resistance to compression under uniaxial strain, which is why the longitudinal modulus $M = K + \\frac{4}{3}\\mu$ is greater than the bulk modulus $K$. Consequently, the longitudinal wave speed $c_L$ is always greater than the bulk sound speed $c_B = \\sqrt{K/\\rho_0}$ (assuming $\\mu0$). The interpretation in Part 1, identifying $c_0$ as $c_B$, is therefore a simplification that is only exact for a fluid ($\\mu=0$).\n\nThe problem asks for an alternative expression for $K$ obtained by equating $c_0$ with the longitudinal wave speed. We set $c_0 = c_L$:\n$$ c_0 = \\sqrt{\\frac{K + \\frac{4}{3}\\mu}{\\rho_0}} $$\nTo find an expression for $K$, we rearrange this equation:\n$$ c_0^2 = \\frac{K + \\frac{4}{3}\\mu}{\\rho_0} $$\n$$ \\rho_0 c_0^2 = K + \\frac{4}{3}\\mu $$\nSolving for $K$ yields the alternative symbolic expression:\n$$ K = \\rho_0 c_0^2 - \\frac{4}{3}\\mu $$\nThis expression explicitly shows that if one accounts for the shear rigidity of the solid, the bulk modulus $K$ is smaller than the value $\\rho_0 c_0^2$ calculated from the hydrodynamic approximation. This is consistent, as $\\rho_0 c_0^2$ would represent the longitudinal modulus $M = K + \\frac{4}{3}\\mu$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{73.0}\n$$", "id": "2917217"}, {"introduction": "The previous exercise utilized the fitted parameters $c_0$ and $s$ from the linear shock-particle velocity model.
