In the context of a cohesive law, this corresponds to the area under the traction-separation curve, $\\sigma(\\delta)$, along the damage (softening) path. We will analyze each case separately.\n\nCase 1: Triangular Cohesive Law\n\nFor the triangular law, the traction-separation relation is defined as follows: at $\\delta = 0$, the traction immediately reaches its peak value, $\\sigma_{\\max}$. It then decreases linearly to $0$ as the separation increases to a critical value $\\delta_{c}$. A graph of $\\sigma$ versus $\\delta$ is a right-angled triangle with vertices at $(0, 0)$, $(0, \\sigma_{\\max})$, and $(\\delta_{c}, 0)$.

First, an initial linear elastic loading from $(\\delta, \\sigma) = (0, 0)$ to $(\\delta_{0}, \\sigma_{\\max})$. The problem explicitly states that only the subsequent softening segment contributes irreversibly to $G_{c}$. This is a critical distinction. Work done during the elastic loading phase is, by definition, recoverable and does not contribute to the work of fracture, $G_{c}$.\n\nThe softening segment begins at the point of damage initiation, $(\\delta_{0}, \\sigma_{\\max})$, and ends at complete failure, $(\\delta_{f}, 0)$. The traction decreases linearly between these two points.

This area is a triangle. The height of this triangle is the peak traction, $\\sigma_{\\max}$. The base of the triangle corresponds to the change in separation during the softening phase, which is $\\Delta\\delta = \\delta_{f} - \\delta_{0}$. Using the given relation $\\delta_{f} = \\delta_{0} + \\delta_{c}$, we find the base to be:\n$$\n\\Delta\\delta = (\\delta_{0} + \\delta_{c}) - \\delta_{0} = \\delta_{c}\n$$\nThe value $\\delta_{c}$ is specifically defined as the characteristic softening separation, consistent with this calculation.\n\nNow, we calculate the area of this softening triangle, which is equal to $G_{c}$:\n$$\nG_{c} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\text{base} \\times \\text{height} = \\frac{1}{2} \\delta_{c} \\sigma_{\\max}\n$$\nThis equation is identical to the one derived for the triangular cohesive law. Therefore, solving for $\\sigma_{\\max}$ gives the same result:\n$$\n\\sigma_{\\max} = \\frac{2 G_{c}}{\\delta_{c}}\n$$\nIn both models, the peak traction is related to the fracture energy and the characteristic softening length by the same expression. This is a direct consequence of how $G_c$ and $\\delta_c$ are defined: in both cases, they define a triangular area representing the work of fracture, where the base is $\\delta_c$ and the height is $\\sigma_{\\max}$.

According to Irwin's crack closure integral, the energy released to create a new crack surface is precisely the work required to close that same surface. Consider a crack advancing by a small length $\\Delta a$ over a width $b$. The newly created crack area is $\\Delta A = b \\Delta a$. The energy released is $\\Delta E = G \\Delta A = G b \\Delta a$. This energy is equal to the work, $\\Delta W_{\\text{closure}}$, needed to close the crack faces over this new area.\n\nWithin a finite element framework using coincident nodes at the crack front, the VCCT provides a computationally efficient means to estimate this work. Let the crack tip be at a node $i$. For the crack to advance to the next node, $i+1$, the constraint holding node $i$ closed must be released. Let the nodal forces holding the coincident nodes at tip $i$ together be $F_x$ (tangential) and $F_y$ (normal). Upon crack extension, node $i$ is now behind the new tip $i+1$, and its two coincident parts separate. Let the relative displacements be $\\Delta u$ (sliding) and $\\Delta v$ (opening).\n\nAssuming linear elasticity, the force at node $i$ decreases linearly from its initial value to zero as the displacement increases from zero to its final value. The work done by the system is therefore the product of the average force and the final displacement. The work done to create the new crack surface, which is equal to the energy released, is:\n$$ \\Delta W_{\\text{release}} = \\frac{1}{2} F_x \\Delta u + \\frac{1}{2} F_y \\Delta v $$\nThis work is the total energy released, $\\Delta E$.

Mode I (opening mode) is associated with the work done by the normal force $F_y$ through the opening displacement $\\Delta v$. Mode II (sliding mode) is associated with the work done by the tangential force $F_x$ through the sliding displacement $\\Delta u$.\nThe expressions for the mode-separated energy release rates are therefore:\n$$ G_I = \\frac{F_y \\Delta v}{2 b \\Delta a} $$\n$$ G_{II} = \\frac{F_x \\Delta u}{2 b \\Delta a} $$\nThe problem states that the quantities $(F_x, F_y)$ are the forces at the crack tip and $(\\Delta u, \\Delta v)$ are the displacements one element behind the tip.
