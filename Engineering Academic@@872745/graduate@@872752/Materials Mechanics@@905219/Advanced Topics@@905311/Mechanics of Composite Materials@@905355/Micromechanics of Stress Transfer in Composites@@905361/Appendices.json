Its claims are scientifically grounded and its structure is logical. We proceed directly to the derivation.\n\nThe constitutive relation for a linear elastic material is given by Hooke's Law. In Voigt notation, the strain vector $\\{\\varepsilon\\}$ and stress vector $\\{\\sigma\\}$ are related by the compliance matrix $[\\mathbf{S}]$ as $\\{\\varepsilon\\} = [\\mathbf{S}] \\{\\sigma\\}$, where $\\{\\sigma\\} = (\\sigma_{11}, \\sigma_{22}, \\sigma_{33}, \\sigma_{23}, \\sigma_{13}, \\sigma_{12})^{\\mathsf{T}}$ and $\\{\\varepsilon\\} = (\\varepsilon_{11}, \\varepsilon_{22}, \\varepsilon_{33}, \\gamma_{23}, \\gamma_{13}, \\gamma_{12})^{\\mathsf{T}}$. The engineering shear strains are defined as $\\gamma_{ij} = 2\\varepsilon_{ij}$ for $i \\neq j$.\n\nFor a transversely isotropic material with the $x_3$-axis as the axis of rotational symmetry, there are five independent elastic constants. The compliance matrix $[\\mathbf{S}]$ has a specific structure due to this symmetry. We construct this matrix by considering elemental loading cases.\n\nFirst, consider a uniaxial tensile stress $\\sigma_{33}$ applied along the fiber axis, with all other stress components being zero. The resulting strains are, by definition of the engineering constants:\n$\\varepsilon_{33} = \\frac{1}{E_L} \\sigma_{33}$\n$\\varepsilon_{11} = -\\nu_{L3} \\varepsilon_{33} = -\\frac{\\nu_{L3}}{E_L} \\sigma_{33}$\n$\\varepsilon_{22} = -\\nu_{L2} \\varepsilon_{33} = -\\frac{\\nu_{L2}}{E_L} \\sigma_{33}$\nDue to rotational symmetry about the $x_3$-axis, the response in the $x_1$ and $x_2$ directions must be identical. Thus, we must have $\\nu_{L3} = \\nu_{L2} = \\nu_{LT}$.\nFrom the matrix relation $\\varepsilon_i = \\sum_{j=1}^6 S_{ij} \\sigma_j$, these definitions immediately yield the compliance components:\n$S_{33} = \\frac{1}{E_L}$\n$S_{13} = -\\frac{\\nu_{LT}}{E_L}$\n$S_{23} = -\\frac{\\nu_{LT}}{E_L}$\n\nSecond, consider a uniaxial tensile stress $\\sigma_{11}$ applied in the transverse plane, with all other stress components zero. The resulting strains are:\n$\\varepsilon_{11} = \\frac{1}{E_T} \\sigma_{11}$\n$\\varepsilon_{22} = -\\nu_{T1} \\varepsilon_{11} = -\\frac{\\nu_{T1}}{E_T} \\sigma_{11}$\n$\\varepsilon_{33} = -\\nu_{T3} \\varepsilon_{11} = -\\frac{\\nu_{T3}}{E_T} \\sigma_{11}$\nThe constant $\\nu_{T1}$ represents Poisson's ratio in the transverse plane ($x_1-x_2$) and is denoted $\\nu_{TT}$. The constant $\\nu_{T3}$ is the Poisson's ratio characterizing contraction in the $x_3$ direction due to tension in the $x_1$ direction; it is denoted $\\nu_{TL}$. Due to isotropy in the transverse plane, a tensile stress $\\sigma_{22}$ would produce analogous strains, implying $E_1=E_2=E_T$ and $\\nu_{T1}=\\nu_{T2}=\\nu_{TT}$. These loading cases give the following compliance components:\n$S_{11} = \\frac{1}{E_T}$\n$S_{22} = \\frac{1}{E_T}$\n$S_{21} = -\\frac{\\nu_{TT}}{E_T}$\n$S_{31} = -\\frac{\\nu_{TL}}{E_T}$\n$S_{32} = -\\frac{\\nu_{TL}}{E_T}$\nThe compliance matrix $[\\mathbf{S}]$ must be symmetric, so $S_{ij} = S_{ji}$. This implies $S_{31} = S_{13}$, which leads to the reciprocity relation:\n$-\\frac{\\nu_{TL}}{E_T} = -\\frac{\\nu_{LT}}{E_L} \\implies \\nu_{TL} E_L = \\nu_{LT} E_T$\nThis relation demonstrates that $\\nu_{TL}$ is not an independent constant.\n\nThird, consider pure shear stresses. A shear stress $\\sigma_{23}$ produces a shear strain $\\gamma_{23} = \\frac{1}{G_{LT}} \\sigma_{23}$. This provides $S_{44} = \\frac{1}{G_{LT}}$. By symmetry, a shear stress $\\sigma_{13}$ gives $\\gamma_{13} = \\frac{1}{G_{LT}} \\sigma_{13}$, thus $S_{55} = S_{44} = \\frac{1}{G_{LT}}$.\nA shear stress $\\sigma_{12}$ in the transverse plane gives a shear strain $\\gamma_{12} = \\frac{1}{G_{TT}} \\sigma_{12}$, giving $S_{66} = \\frac{1}{G_{TT}}$. For an isotropic plane, the shear modulus is related to the Young's modulus and Poisson's ratio by $G_{TT} = \\frac{E_T}{2(1+\\nu_{TT})}$. This parameter is therefore not independent.\n\nThe normal and shear components are uncoupled for a TI material aligned with the coordinate axes. The complete compliance matrix $[\\mathbf{S}]$ is:\n$$\n[\\mathbf{S}] = \\begin{pmatrix}\n\\frac{1}{E_T}  -\\frac{\\nu_{TT}}{E_T}  -\\frac{\\nu_{LT}}{E_L}  0  0  0 \\\\\n-\\frac{\\nu_{TT}}{E_T}  \\frac{1}{E_T}  -\\frac{\\nu_{LT}}{E_L}  0  0  0 \\\\\n-\\frac{\\nu_{LT}}{E_L}  -\\frac{\\nu_{LT}}{E_L}  \\frac{1}{E_L}  0  0  0 \\\\\n0  0  0  \\frac{1}{G_{LT}}  0  0 \\\\\n0  0  0  0  \\frac{1}{G_{LT}}  0 \\\\\n0  0  0  0  0  \\frac{2(1+\\nu_{TT})}{E_T}\n\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe stiffness matrix $[\\mathbf{C}]$ is the inverse of $[\\mathbf{S}]$.

A solution will be derived.\n\nThe governing equation for the out-of-plane displacement $w$ in an isotropic, linear elastic material under antiplane shear is derived from the equilibrium equation $\\nabla \\cdot \\boldsymbol{\\sigma} = 0$. The only non-zero stress components are $\\tau_{xz} = G \\frac{\\partial w}{\\partial x}$ and $\\tau_{yz} = G \\frac{\\partial w}{\\partial y}$, where $G$ is the shear modulus. The equilibrium equation reduces to $\\frac{\\partial \\tau_{xz}}{\\partial x} + \\frac{\\partial \\tau_{yz}}{\\partial y} = 0$. Since the shear modulus is constant within each phase (matrix or inclusion), this becomes Laplace's equation for the displacement field:\n$$ \\nabla^2 w = \\frac{\\partial^2 w}{\\partial x^2} + \\frac{\\partial^2 w}{\\partial y^2} = 0 $$\nThis equation holds in both the inclusion ($r  a$) and the matrix ($r  a$). Due to the cylindrical geometry, we work in polar coordinates $(r, \\theta)$, where $x=r\\cos\\theta$ and $y=r\\sin\\theta$. The governing equation is:\n$$ \\nabla^2 w = \\frac{1}{r} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial r} \\left(r \\frac{\\partial w}{\\partial r}\\right) + \\frac{1}{r^2} \\frac{\\partial^2 w}{\\partial \\theta^2} = 0 $$\nThe far-field boundary condition is $w \\to \\gamma_0 y = \\gamma_0 r \\sin\\theta$ as $r \\to \\infty$.\n\nWe propose solutions for the displacement field inside the inclusion, $w_i(r,\\theta)$ for $r \\le a$, and in the matrix, $w_m(r,\\theta)$ for $r \\ge a$.\n\nFor the matrix ($r \\ge a$), the solution must approach the far-field behavior. The general solution consists of the uniform field plus a perturbation that must decay as $r \\to \\infty$. Guided by the $\\sin\\theta$ dependence of the far-field condition, we seek a solution of the form:\n$$ w_m(r, \\theta) = \\gamma_0 r \\sin\\theta + D_m r^{-1} \\sin\\theta $$\nThis form satisfies Laplace's equation and the far-field condition. The term $D_m r^{-1} \\sin\\theta$ represents the perturbation due to the inclusion.\n\nFor the inclusion ($r \\le a$), the displacement must remain finite at the origin ($r=0$). This eliminates terms like $r^{-n}$ and $\\ln(r)$. The solution must match the angular dependence of the exterior field at the boundary. Therefore, we propose a solution of the form:\n$$ w_i(r, \\theta) = C_i r \\sin\\theta $$\nThis form satisfies Laplace's equation and is regular at the origin.\n\nThe unknown coefficients $C_i$ and $D_m$ are determined by applying the perfect bonding conditions at the interface $r=a$.\n1.  **Continuity of displacement**: $w_m(a, \\theta) = w_i(a, \\theta)$\n    $$ \\gamma_0 a \\sin\\theta + D_m a^{-1} \\sin\\theta = C_i a \\sin\\theta $$\n    Dividing by $a\\sin\\theta$ (for $\\theta \\ne 0, \\pi$) yields:\n    $$ \\gamma_0 + D_m a^{-2} = C_i \\quad (1) $$\n2.  **Continuity of traction**: The only non-zero traction component on the cylindrical surface is the radial shear stress, $\\tau_{rz}$.

The non-zero strain components are $\\epsilon_{xz}^{(i)}$ and $\\epsilon_{yz}^{(i)}$.\nSince $w_i = C_i y$, the derivatives are $\\frac{\\partial w_i}{\\partial x} = 0$ and $\\frac{\\partial w_i}{\\partial y} = C_i$.\nThe strains are $\\epsilon_{xz}^{(i)} = \\frac{1}{2}\\frac{\\partial w_i}{\\partial x} = 0$ and $\\epsilon_{yz}^{(i)} = \\frac{1}{2}\\frac{\\partial w_i}{\\partial y} = \\frac{1}{2} C_i$.\nThe strain state is thus determined by the coefficient $C_i$. We take the limit of $C_i$ as $G_i \\to \\infty$:\n$$ \\lim_{G_i \\to \\infty} C_i = \\lim_{G_i \\to \\infty} \\frac{2 G_m \\gamma_0}{G_m + G_i} = 0 $$\nSince $C_i \\to 0$, the strain component $\\epsilon_{yz}^{(i)} \\to 0$. All strain components in the inclusion are zero in this limit. This is consistent with the definition of a rigid body, which does not deform.\n\n(b) To compute the perturbation stress field in the matrix for the rigid-inclusion limit ($G_i \\to \\infty$), we first identify the perturbation displacement, $w^{\\mathrm{pert}}$.

It is a standard, albeit simplified, exercise in inverse parameter estimation within the field of materials mechanics. A solution will be provided based on the specified first principles.\n\n**Derivation and Solution**\n\nThe problem requires a two-part solution where the two unknowns, $\\tau_i$ and $E_m$, are estimated from two independent sets of experimental data. The derivations are presented sequentially.\n\n**1. Estimation of Interfacial Shear Strength ($\\tau_i$)**\n\nThe estimation of $\\tau_i$ is based on the single-fiber fragmentation test data. The core assumption is the constant shear-lag model.\n\nConsider a single fiber of radius $r$ embedded in a matrix. At a fiber break, the axial stress in the fiber is zero. Stress is built up along the fiber length $x$ away from the break via shear stress $\\tau_i$ at the fiber-matrix interface. An axial force balance on a differential fiber element of length $dx$ yields:\n$$\ndF_f = \\tau_i \\cdot dA_s\n$$\nwhere $dF_f$ is the change in axial force in the fiber and $dA_s = 2\\pi r \\, dx$ is the interfacial surface area of the element. The axial force is related to the fiber stress $\\sigma_f$ by $F_f = \\sigma_f A_f$, where $A_f = \\pi r^2$ is the fiber cross-sectional area. Thus, $dF_f = A_f d\\sigma_f$. Substituting this into the force balance gives:\n$$\n(\\pi r^2) d\\sigma_f = \\tau_i (2\\pi r) dx\n$$\nRearranging gives the gradient of the fiber stress:\n$$\n\\frac{d\\sigma_f}{dx} = \\frac{2\\tau_i}{r}\n$$\nSince $\\tau_i$ and $r$ are assumed constant, the stress profile is linear: $\\sigma_f(x) = \\frac{2\\tau_i}{r}x$, where $x$ is the distance from the fiber break.\n\nThe process of fragmentation continues until the fragments are too short to be broken further. A fragment of length $\\ell$ can be broken only if the maximum stress at its center reaches the fiber's ultimate tensile strength, $\\sigma_{fu}$. The stress at the center ($x=\\ell/2$) is built up from both ends, reaching a maximum of:\n$$\n\\sigma_{f,\\text{max}} = \\frac{2\\tau_i}{r} \\left(\\frac{\\ell}{2}\\right) = \\frac{\\tau_i \\ell}{r}\n$$\nThe condition for a new break to be possible is $\\sigma_{f,\\text{max}} \\ge \\sigma_{fu}$. This defines a critical length, $\\ell_c$, below which no further breakage can occur:\n$$\n\\ell_c = \\frac{\\sigma_{fu} r}{\\tau_i}\n$$\nThe problem stipulates that the measured saturated fragment lengths, $\\{\\ell_i\\}$, are samples from an exponential probability distribution with a mean equal to this critical length, $\\ell_c$. For an exponential distribution, the maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) for its mean is the sample arithmetic mean. Therefore, we estimate the critical length, $\\hat{\\ell}_c$, by computing the average of the observed fragment lengths:\n$$\n\\hat{\\ell}_c = \\langle \\ell \\rangle = \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{i=1}^N \\ell_i\n$$\nBy substituting this estimator into the equation for the critical length and rearranging, we obtain the estimator for the interfacial shear strength:\n$$\n\\hat{\\tau}_i = \\frac{\\sigma_{fu} r}{\\hat{\\ell}_c} = \\frac{\\sigma_{fu} r}{\\langle \\ell \\rangle}\n$$\n\n**2. Estimation of Matrix Modulus ($E_m$)**\n\nThe estimation of $E_m$ is based on the measured overall composite modulus, $E_c$. The governing principle is the iso-strain assumption, which is the foundation of the 'rule of mixtures' for the longitudinal modulus of a continuous, aligned fiber composite.\n\nThe iso-strain condition states that the strain is uniform throughout the composite and its constituents under axial loading:\n$$\n\\epsilon_c = \\epsilon_f = \\epsilon_m = \\epsilon\n$$\nThe total axial force on the composite, $F_c$, is the sum of the forces carried by the fibers, $F_f$, and the matrix, $F_m$:\n$$\nF_c = F_f + F_m\n$$\nDividing by the total cross-sectional area of the composite, $A_c$, gives the relationship for the overall stress, $\\sigma_c$:\n$$\n\\sigma_c = \\frac{F_c}{A_c} = \\frac{F_f}{A_c} + \\frac{F_m}{A_c} = \\sigma_f \\frac{A_f}{A_c} + \\sigma_m \\frac{A_m}{A_c}\n$$\nFor a unidirectional composite, the area fractions are equal to the volume fractions: $V_f = A_f/A_c$ and $V_m = A_m/A_c = 1 - V_f$. The stress equation becomes:\n$$\n\\sigma_c = \\sigma_f V_f + \\sigma_m (1 - V_f)\n$$\nUsing the linear elastic constitutive relation $\\sigma = E\\epsilon$ for each component:\n$$\nE_c \\epsilon_c = (E_f \\epsilon_f) V_f + (E_m \\epsilon_m) (1 - V_f)\n$$\nGiven the iso-strain condition, the strain term $\\epsilon$ cancels from the equation, yielding the rule of mixtures:\n$$\nE_c = E_f V_f + E_m (1 - V_f)\n$$\nThis equation can be rearranged to solve for the unknown matrix modulus, $E_m$, using the measured value of $E_c$ and the known properties $E_f$ and $V_f$:\n$$\nE_m (1 - V_f) = E_c - E_f V_f \\implies E_m = \\frac{E_c - E_f V_f}{1 - V_f}\n$$\n\n**3. Computational Procedure**\n\nThe two estimations are decoupled under the stated assumptions. The procedure is as follows for each test case:\n1.
