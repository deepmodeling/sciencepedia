There are no contradictions, missing data, or scientifically unsound premises. The problem is therefore deemed valid and a solution can be formulated.\n\nThe Schmid factor, $m$, is defined by the geometric relationship between the applied stress axis and the slip system. For a slip plane with unit normal $\\hat{\\mathbf{n}}$ and a slip direction with unit vector $\\hat{\\mathbf{d}}$, subjected to a uniaxial stress along a direction defined by the unit vector $\\hat{\\mathbf{s}}$, the Schmid factor is:\n$$m = |\\cos(\\phi) \\cos(\\lambda)|$$\nwhere $\\phi$ is the angle between the loading axis $\\hat{\\mathbf{s}}$ and the slip plane normal $\\hat{\\mathbf{n}}$, and $\\lambda$ is the angle between the loading axis $\\hat{\\mathbf{s}}$ and the slip direction $\\hat{\\mathbf{d}}$.\n\nThe cosine terms can be expressed using the dot product of the respective vectors. Let the loading axis be represented by the vector $\\mathbf{s}=[123]$, the slip plane normal by $\\mathbf{n}=[hkl]$, and the slip direction by $\\mathbf{d}=[uvw]$.

For a tensile axis $\\mathbf{l}=[l_1, l_2, l_3]$, a slip plane normal $\\mathbf{n}=(n_1, n_2, n_3)$, and a slip direction $\\mathbf{s}=[s_1, s_2, s_3]$, the Schmid factor is calculated as:\n$$ m = \\frac{| \\mathbf{l} \\cdot \\mathbf{n} |}{||\\mathbf{l}|| \\cdot ||\\mathbf{n}||} \\frac{| \\mathbf{l} \\cdot \\mathbf{s} |}{||\\mathbf{l}|| \\cdot ||\\mathbf{s}||} $$\nFor FCC crystals, the slip planes are of the $\\{111\\}$ family and slip directions are of the $\\langle 110 \\rangle$ family. We must find the maximum Schmid factor for each of the three given loading axes by examining all $12$ possible slip systems.\n\nCase 1: Tension along $\\mathbf{l}_1 = [001]$. The yield stress is $\\sigma_1 = 180$ MPa.\nThe norm is $||\\mathbf{l}_1|| = \\sqrt{0^2+0^2+1^2} = 1$. The slip plane normals are of the form $\\{111\\}$, so for any such plane, e.g., $\\mathbf{n}=(111)$, its norm is $||\\mathbf{n}||=\\sqrt{1^2+1^2+1^2}=\\sqrt{3}$. The dot product is $|\\mathbf{l}_1 \\cdot \\mathbf{n}| = |(0)(1)+(0)(1)+(1)(1)|=1$. Thus, $|\\cos(\\phi)| = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}}$ for all four $\\{111\\}$ planes.\nSlip directions are of the form $\\langle 110 \\rangle$, with norm $||\\mathbf{s}||=\\sqrt{1^2+1^2+0^2}=\\sqrt{2}$. To maximize $m$, we need a non-zero dot product $|\\mathbf{l}_1 \\cdot \\mathbf{s}|$. For $\\mathbf{s}=[uvw]$, this is $|w|$. The slip directions with non-zero $w$ components are $[101]$, $[10\\bar{1}]$, $[011]$, and $[0\\bar{1}1]$, for which $|w|=1$. For these, $|\\cos(\\lambda)| = \\frac{1}{1 \\cdot \\sqrt{2}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}$.\nWe must check if these directions lie in any $\\{111\\}$ plane (i.e., $\\mathbf{n} \\cdot \\mathbf{s} = 0$). For example, for the plane $\\mathbf{n}=(111)$, the direction $\\mathbf{s}=[10\\bar{1}]$ satisfies $(111)\\cdot[10\\bar{1}] = 1+0-1 = 0$.\nThe maximum Schmid factor is the product:\n$$ m_1 = \\max(|\\cos(\\phi)\\cos(\\lambda)|) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}} \\cdot \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{6}} $$\nThere are $8$ slip systems that share this maximum Schmid factor.\n\nCase 2: Tension along $\\mathbf{l}_2 = [011]$. The yield stress is $\\sigma_2 = 160$ MPa.\nThe norm is $||\\mathbf{l}_2|| = \\sqrt{0^2+1^2+1^2} = \\sqrt{2}$.\nFor the slip plane $\\mathbf{n}=(111)$, which has norm $||\\mathbf{n}||=\\sqrt{3}$, the dot product is $\\mathbf{l}_2 \\cdot \\mathbf{n} = 0+1+1=2$. So $|\\cos(\\phi)| = \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{2}\\sqrt{3}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{\\sqrt{3}}$. Planes like $(1\\bar{1}1)$ would give $\\cos(\\phi)=0$.\nFor the slip direction $\\mathbf{s}=[\\bar{1}10]$, which has norm $||\\mathbf{s}||=\\sqrt{2}$ and lies in the $(111)$ plane, the dot product is $\\mathbf{l}_2 \\cdot \\mathbf{s} = 0+1+0=1$. So $|\\cos(\\lambda)| = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}\\sqrt{2}} = \\frac{1}{2}$.\nThe resulting Schmid factor for this system is:\n$$m = |\\cos(\\phi)\\cos(\\lambda)| = \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{\\sqrt{3}} \\cdot \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2\\sqrt{3}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{6}}$$\nSystematic check of all $12$ slip systems confirms that this is the maximum value.\n$$ m_2 = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{6}} $$\nThere are $4$ slip systems sharing this maximum value.\n\nCase 3: Tension along $\\mathbf{l}_3 = [111]$. The yield stress is $\\sigma_3 = 300$ MPa.\nThe norm is $||\\mathbf{l}_3|| = \\sqrt{1^2+1^2+1^2} = \\sqrt{3}$.\nIf the slip plane is $\\mathbf{n}=(111)$, it is parallel to the loading axis. Thus $\\phi=0$, but any slip direction $\\mathbf{s}$ in this plane is orthogonal to the loading axis, so $\\lambda=90^\\circ$ and $\\cos(\\lambda)=0$. Hence, $m=0$ for all systems on the $(111)$ plane.\nConsider another plane, e.g., $\\mathbf{n}=(1\\bar{1}1)$, with norm $||\\mathbf{n}||=\\sqrt{3}$. The dot product is $\\mathbf{l}_3 \\cdot \\mathbf{n} = 1-1+1=1$.

The dot product is $\\mathbf{l}_3 \\cdot \\mathbf{s} = -1-1+0=-2$. Thus, $|\\cos(\\lambda)| = \\frac{|-2|}{\\sqrt{3}\\sqrt{2}} = \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{6}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{\\sqrt{3}}$.\nThe resulting Schmid factor for this system is:\n$$m = |\\cos(\\phi)\\cos(\\lambda)| = \\frac{1}{3} \\cdot \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{\\sqrt{3}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{3\\sqrt{3}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{6}}{9}$$\nSystematic check reveals this is the maximum value.\n$$ m_3 = \\frac{\\sqrt{6}}{9} $$\nThere are $6$ slip systems sharing this maximum value.\n\nPart 2: Least-Squares Estimate of Critical Resolved Shear Stress, $\\hat{\\tau}_c$\nWe are to find $\\hat{\\tau}_c$ that minimizes the sum of squared residuals $S = \\sum_{i=1}^{3} (\\sigma_i m_i - \\tau_c)^2$. Setting the derivative with respect to $\\tau_c$ to zero gives:\n$$ \\frac{dS}{d\\tau_c} = \\sum_{i=1}^{3} -2(\\sigma_i m_i - \\tau_c) = 0 \\implies \\sum \\sigma_i m_i - 3\\tau_c = 0 $$\nThe least-squares estimate is the arithmetic mean of the observed resolved shear stresses:\n$$ \\hat{\\tau}_c = \\frac{1}{3} \\sum_{i=1}^{3} \\sigma_i m_i $$\nLet us compute the products $\\sigma_i m_i$:\n- For $i=1$: $\\sigma_1 m_1 = 180 \\cdot \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{6}} = \\frac{180}{\\sqrt{6}}$ MPa.\n- For $i=2$: $\\sigma_2 m_2 = 160 \\cdot \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{6}} = \\frac{160}{\\sqrt{6}}$ MPa.\n- For $i=3$: $\\sigma_3 m_3 = 300 \\cdot \\frac{\\sqrt{6}}{9} = \\frac{100\\sqrt{6}}{3} = \\frac{100 \\cdot 6}{3\\sqrt{6}} = \\frac{200}{\\sqrt{6}}$ MPa.\nNow, we compute $\\hat{\\tau}_c$:\n$$ \\hat{\\tau}_c = \\frac{1}{3} \\left( \\frac{180}{\\sqrt{6}} + \\frac{160}{\\sqrt{6}} + \\frac{200}{\\sqrt{6}} \\right) = \\frac{1}{3} \\left( \\frac{540}{\\sqrt{6}} \\right) = \\frac{180}{\\sqrt{6}} \\text{ MPa} $$\n$\\hat{\\tau}_c = 30\\sqrt{6}$ MPa, which is approximately $73.48$ MPa.\n\nPart 3: Evaluation of the Fractional Deviation $D$\nThe fractional deviation $D$ is defined as:\n$$ D = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{3}\\sum_{i=1}^{3}\\left(\\frac{\\sigma_i m_i - \\hat{\\tau}_c}{\\hat{\\tau}_c}\\right)^{2}} $$\nWe calculate the individual terms in the summation:\n- Term 1: $\\frac{\\sigma_1 m_1 - \\hat{\\tau}_c}{\\hat{\\tau}_c} = \\frac{\\frac{180}{\\sqrt{6}} - \\frac{180}{\\sqrt{6}}}{\\frac{180}{\\sqrt{6}}} = 0$.\n- Term 2: $\\frac{\\sigma_2 m_2 - \\hat{\\tau}_c}{\\hat{\\tau}_c} = \\frac{\\frac{160}{\\sqrt{6}} - \\frac{180}{\\sqrt{6}}}{\\frac{180}{\\sqrt{6}}} = \\frac{-20/\\sqrt{6}}{180/\\sqrt{6}} = -\\frac{20}{180} = -\\frac{1}{9}$.\n- Term 3: $\\frac{\\sigma_3 m_3 - \\hat{\\tau}_c}{\\hat{\\tau}_c} = \\frac{\\frac{200}{\\sqrt{6}} - \\frac{180}{\\sqrt{6}}}{\\frac{180}{\\sqrt{6}}} = \\frac{20/\\sqrt{6}}{180/\\sqrt{6}} = \\frac{20}{180} = \\frac{1}{9}$.\nThe sum of squares is:\n$$ \\sum_{i=1}^{3}\\left(\\frac{\\sigma_i m_i - \\hat{\\tau}_c}{\\hat{\\tau}_c}\\right)^{2} = (0)^2 + \\left(-\\frac{1}{9}\\right)^2 + \\left(\\frac{1}{9}\\right)^2 = \\frac{1}{81} + \\frac{1}{81} = \\frac{2}{81} $$\nNow, we compute $D$:\n$$ D = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{3} \\cdot \\frac{2}{81}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{2}{243}} $$\nNumerically, $D \\approx 0.0907218...$.
