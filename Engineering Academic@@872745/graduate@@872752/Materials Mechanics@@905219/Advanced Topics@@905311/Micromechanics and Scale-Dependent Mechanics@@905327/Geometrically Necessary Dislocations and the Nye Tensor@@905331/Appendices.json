However, the function $u_{3}$ is multi-valued at the origin, manifested by the fact that the angle $\\theta(x_{1}, x_{2})$ increases by $2\\pi$ upon completion of any circuit around the origin. Consequently, its derivatives must be treated as distributions.\n\nThe fundamental connection between the dislocation density and the displacement field is established through the Burgers circuit. The Burgers vector $\\mathbf{b}$ is the closure failure of a lattice circuit, which in the continuum limit corresponds to the line integral of the elastic distortion around a closed loop $C$:\n$$\nb_{i} = \\oint_{C} d u_{i} = \\oint_{C} (\\partial_{l}u_{i}) \\,dx_{l} = \\oint_{C} \\beta^{e}_{il}\\,dx_{l}\n$$\nFor the given screw dislocation, the Burgers vector is $\\mathbf{b} = (0,0,b)$.

If the loop $C$ does not enclose the origin, the integral is zero.\n\nWe can relate this line integral to a surface integral of the dislocation density using Stokes' theorem in the $x_{1}$-$x_{2}$ plane. Let $A$ be the area enclosed by the curve $C$.\n$$\n\\oint_{C} \\left( \\beta^{e}_{31}\\,dx_{1} + \\beta^{e}_{32}\\,dx_{2} \\right) = \\iint_{A} \\left( \\partial_{1}\\beta^{e}_{32} - \\partial_{2}\\beta^{e}_{31} \\right) \\,dx_{1}dx_{2}\n$$\nThe integrand is precisely $\\alpha_{33}(x_{1}, x_{2})$.

The integral of $\\delta(x_{1}, x_{2})$ over any area containing the origin is $1$, and zero otherwise.\nFrom this, we conclude that the dislocation density component $\\alpha_{33}$ on any plane of constant $x_{3}$ is:\n$$\n\\alpha_{33}(x_{1}, x_{2}) = b\\,\\delta(x_{1})\\delta(x_{2})\n$$\nSince the dislocation line is infinite and straight along the $x_{3}$-axis, this distribution is independent of $x_{3}$. Therefore, the expression $\\alpha_{33} = b\\,\\delta(x_{1})\\delta(x_{2})$ represents the dislocation density distribution in $\\mathbb{R}^{3}$. It describes a line density of magnitude $b$ concentrated on the $x_{3}$-axis.\n\nIn summary, the components of $\\alpha_{i3}$ are:\n$\\alpha_{13} = 0$\n$\\alpha_{23} = 0$\n$\\alpha_{33} = b\\,\\delta(x_{1})\\delta(x_{2})$\n\nThe final answer should be presented as a row matrix.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 & b\\,\\delta(x_{1})\\delta(x_{2}) \\end{pmatrix}}\n$$", "id": "2889219"}, {"introduction": "While the Nye tensor effectively captures the net geometric effect of dislocations, it does not uniquely determine the underlying plastic slip activity that generated them.

We now compute this derivative using the provided profile $\\Omega_{z}(x) = \\frac{\\Delta \\theta}{2} \\mathrm{erf}\\left(\\frac{x}{\\sqrt{2}\\,\\ell}\\right)$.\nUsing the chain rule and the identity $\\frac{d}{du}\\mathrm{erf}(u) = \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{\\pi}}\\exp(-u^{2})$:\n$$ \\frac{d\\Omega_z}{dx} = \\frac{\\Delta \\theta}{2} \\cdot \\frac{d}{dx}\\left[\\mathrm{erf}\\left(\\frac{x}{\\sqrt{2}\\,\\ell}\\right)\\right] = \\frac{\\Delta \\theta}{2} \\cdot \\left[ \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{\\pi}} \\exp\\left(-\\left(\\frac{x}{\\sqrt{2}\\,\\ell}\\right)^2\\right) \\right] \\cdot \\frac{d}{dx}\\left(\\frac{x}{\\sqrt{2}\\,\\ell}\\right) $$\n$$ \\frac{d\\Omega_z}{dx} = \\frac{\\Delta \\theta}{\\sqrt{\\pi}} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{x^2}{2\\ell^2}\\right) \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}\\,\\ell} = \\frac{\\Delta \\theta}{\\sqrt{2\\pi}\\,\\ell} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{x^2}{2\\ell^2}\\right) $$\nThe true nonzero component of the dislocation density is therefore:\n$$ \\alpha_{xz}^{\\text{true}}(x) = -\\frac{\\Delta \\theta}{\\sqrt{2\\pi}\\,\\ell} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{x^2}{2\\ell^2}\\right) $$\nThis is a Gaussian function centered at $x=0$. The peak is at $x=0$:\n$$ \\alpha_{\\text{peak}}^{\\text{true}} = \\alpha_{xz}^{\\text{true}}(0) = -\\frac{\\Delta \\theta}{\\sqrt{2\\pi}\\,\\ell} $$\nThe magnitude of the true peak is $|\\alpha_{\\text{peak}}^{\\text{true}}| = \\frac{|\\Delta \\theta|}{\\sqrt{2\\pi}\\,\\ell}$.\n\nStage 2: Determine the measured dislocation density.\nThe measured rotation field is the convolution of the true field with the top-hat kernel: $\\Omega_z^{\\text{meas}}(x) = (\\Omega_z * h_{\\Delta})(x)$. The measured dislocation density is derived from this averaged field:\n$$ \\alpha_{xz}^{\\text{meas}}(x) = -\\frac{d}{dx} \\Omega_z^{\\text{meas}}(x) = -\\frac{d}{dx}\\left( \\Omega_z * h_{\\Delta} \\right)(x) $$\nUsing the property of convolution that differentiation can be passed to either function, $\\frac{d}{dx}(f*g) = (\\frac{df}{dx}*g)$, we have:\n$$ \\alpha_{xz}^{\\text{meas}}(x) = -\\left( \\frac{d\\Omega_z}{dx} * h_{\\Delta} \\right)(x) $$\nSince we found that $\\alpha_{xz}^{\\text{true}}(x) = -\\frac{d\\Omega_z}{dx}$, we can write:\n$$ \\alpha_{xz}^{\\text{meas}}(x) = \\left( \\alpha_{xz}^{\\text{true}} * h_{\\Delta} \\right)(x) $$\nThe measured dislocation density is the convolution of the true dislocation density with the averaging kernel. The peak measured value occurs at $x=0$ due to the symmetry of both $\\alpha_{xz}^{\\text{true}}(x)$ and $h_{\\Delta}(x)$.\n$$ \\alpha_{\\text{peak}}^{\\text{meas}} = \\alpha_{xz}^{\\text{meas}}(0) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\alpha_{xz}^{\\text{true}}(\\tau) h_{\\Delta}(0-\\tau) d\\tau $$\nSince $h_{\\Delta}(x)$ is an even function, $h_{\\Delta}(-\\tau) = h_{\\Delta}(\\tau)$.\n$$ \\alpha_{\\text{peak}}^{\\text{meas}} = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\alpha_{xz}^{\\text{true}}(\\tau) h_{\\Delta}(\\tau) d\\tau = \\int_{-\\Delta/2}^{\\Delta/2} \\left( -\\frac{\\Delta \\theta}{\\sqrt{2\\pi}\\,\\ell} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\tau^2}{2\\ell^2}\\right) \\right) \\frac{1}{\\Delta} d\\tau $$\n$$ \\alpha_{\\text{peak}}^{\\text{meas}} = -\\frac{\\Delta \\theta}{\\Delta \\sqrt{2\\pi}\\,\\ell} \\int_{-\\Delta/2}^{\\Delta/2} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\tau^2}{2\\ell^2}\\right) d\\tau $$\nTo evaluate the integral, we relate it to the error function. Let $u = \\frac{\\tau}{\\sqrt{2}\\,\\ell}$, so $d\\tau = \\sqrt{2}\\,\\ell\\,du$. The integration limits for $u$ are from $-\\frac{\\Delta}{2\\sqrt{2}\\,\\ell}$ to $\\frac{\\Delta}{2\\sqrt{2}\\,\\ell}$.\n$$ \\int_{-\\Delta/2}^{\\Delta/2} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\tau^2}{2\\ell^2}\\right) d\\tau = \\int_{-\\frac{\\Delta}{2\\sqrt{2}\\,\\ell}}^{\\frac{\\Delta}{2\\sqrt{2}\\,\\ell}} \\exp(-u^2) (\\sqrt{2}\\,\\ell\\,du) = \\sqrt{2}\\,\\ell \\int_{-\\frac{\\Delta}{2\\sqrt{2}\\,\\ell}}^{\\frac{\\Delta}{2\\sqrt{2}\\,\\ell}} \\exp(-u^2) du $$\nUsing the definition $\\int_0^a \\exp(-u^2)du = \\frac{\\sqrt{\\pi}}{2}\\mathrm{erf}(a)$ and the evenness of the integrand:\n$$ = \\sqrt{2}\\,\\ell \\cdot 2 \\int_{0}^{\\frac{\\Delta}{2\\sqrt{2}\\,\\ell}} \\exp(-u^2) du = \\sqrt{2}\\,\\ell \\cdot 2 \\cdot \\frac{\\sqrt{\\pi}}{2} \\mathrm{erf}\\left(\\frac{\\Delta}{2\\sqrt{2}\\,\\ell}\\right) = \\sqrt{2\\pi}\\,\\ell \\cdot \\mathrm{erf}\\left(\\frac{\\Delta}{2\\sqrt{2}\\,\\ell}\\right) $$\nSubstituting this result back into the expression for $\\alpha_{\\text{peak}}^{\\text{meas}}$:\n$$ \\alpha_{\\text{peak}}^{\\text{meas}} = -\\frac{\\Delta \\theta}{\\Delta \\sqrt{2\\pi}\\,\\ell} \\left( \\sqrt{2\\pi}\\,\\ell \\cdot \\mathrm{erf}\\left(\\frac{\\Delta}{2\\sqrt{2}\\,\\ell}\\right) \\right) = -\\frac{\\Delta \\theta}{\\Delta} \\mathrm{erf}\\left(\\frac{\\Delta}{2\\sqrt{2}\\,\\ell}\\right) $$\nThe magnitude of the measured peak is $|\\alpha_{\\text{peak}}^{\\text{meas}}| = \\frac{|\\Delta \\theta|}{\\Delta} \\mathrm{erf}\\left(\\frac{\\Delta}{2\\sqrt{2}\\,\\ell}\\right)$.\n\nStage 3: Calculate the fractional underestimation.\nThe fractional underestimation $U(\\Delta,\\ell)$ is defined as:\n$$ U(\\Delta,\\ell) = 1 - \\frac{|\\alpha_{\\text{peak}}^{\\text{meas}}|}{|\\alpha_{\\text{peak}}^{\\text{true}}|} $$\nSubstituting the derived magnitudes:\n$$ \\frac{|\\alpha_{\\text{peak}}^{\\text{meas}}|}{|\\alpha_{\\text{peak}}^{\\text{true}}|} = \\frac{\\frac{|\\Delta \\theta|}{\\Delta} \\mathrm{erf}\\left(\\frac{\\Delta}{2\\sqrt{2}\\,\\ell}\\right)}{\\frac{|\\Delta \\theta|}{\\sqrt{2\\pi}\\,\\ell}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{2\\pi}\\,\\ell}{\\Delta} \\mathrm{erf}\\left(\\frac{\\Delta}{2\\sqrt{2}\\,\\ell}\\right) $$\nTherefore, the fractional underestimation is:\n$$ U(\\Delta,\\ell) = 1 - \\frac{\\sqrt{2\\pi}\\,\\ell}{\\Delta} \\mathrm{erf}\\left(\\frac{\\Delta}{2\\sqrt{2}\\,\\ell}\\right) $$\nThis is the final closed-form expression.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{1 - \\frac{\\sqrt{2\\pi}\\ell}{\\Delta} \\mathrm{erf}\\left(\\frac{\\Delta}{2\\sqrt{2}\\ell}\\right)}$$", "id": "2889172"}]}
