The core of the problem lies in the principle of scale separation, which is fundamental to any homogenization theory. The first-order theory is valid only when the characteristic length scale of the microstructure, $a$, is significantly smaller than the characteristic length scale of the macroscopic strain field variation. We will formalize this condition.\n\nLet the macroscopic position vector be denoted by $\\mathbf{x}$ and the macroscopic strain tensor field be $\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}(\\mathbf{x})$. First-order homogenization schemes, based on a Representative Volume Element (RVE), approximate the strain field within the RVE as uniform, equal to the macroscopic strain $\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}$ at the centroid of the RVE. This approximation neglects the gradient of the macroscopic strain, $\\nabla\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}(\\mathbf{x})$, across the RVE. The accuracy of this approximation depends on how much $\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}(\\mathbf{x})$ actually varies over the RVE domain.\n\nWe use a first-order Taylor expansion of the macroscopic strain field $\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}(\\mathbf{x})$ around a point $\\mathbf{x}_0$, which we can take as the center of the RVE. For a point $\\mathbf{x}$ within the RVE, where $\\mathbf{x} = \\mathbf{x}_0 + \\Delta\\mathbf{x}$ and the magnitude of the displacement vector $\\|\\Delta\\mathbf{x}\\|$ is on the order of the RVE size (which is comparable to the unit cell size $a$), the strain is:\n$$ \\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}(\\mathbf{x}_0 + \\Delta\\mathbf{x}) \\approx \\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}(\\mathbf{x}_0) + \\nabla\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}|_{\\mathbf{x}_0} \\cdot \\Delta\\mathbf{x} $$\nHere, $\\nabla\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}$ is the third-order tensor representing the gradient of the strain field.\n\nThe variation of the strain across the RVE, $\\Delta\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}$, is the difference between the strain at a point and the strain at the center:\n$$ \\Delta\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon} = \\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}(\\mathbf{x}_0 + \\Delta\\mathbf{x}) - \\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}(\\mathbf{x}_0) \\approx \\nabla\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}|_{\\mathbf{x}_0} \\cdot \\Delta\\mathbf{x} $$\nTo quantify this variation in a relative sense, we consider the ratio of the norm of the strain variation to the norm of the strain itself.

Let us denote this scale by $L_{\\varepsilon}^{-1}$. Thus, the relative variation of strain across one unit cell is proportional to $a \\cdot L_{\\varepsilon}^{-1}$.\n\nThe problem states that the macroscopic domain is a curved structure with a characteristic radius of curvature $R$. In such a scenario, for instance, under bending, the strain field typically varies linearly with the distance from a neutral surface. A classic example is a beam bent with radius $R$, where the axial strain is given by $\\varepsilon \\approx z/R$, with $z$ being the coordinate perpendicular to the neutral axis. The gradient of this strain is $\\frac{d\\varepsilon}{dz} = \\frac{1}{R}$. In a more general three-dimensional context, for deformations dominated by macroscopic curvature, the dominant component of the strain gradient scales with $1/R$. Therefore, it is justified to state that the characteristic inverse length scale of strain variation is of the order of $1/R$:\n$$ L_{\\varepsilon}^{-1} \\sim \\frac{1}{R} $$\nSubstituting this into our expression for the relative strain variation, we conclude that this variation is of the order of $a/R$. This ratio of two characteristic lengths, the microscopic length $a$ and the macroscopic length $R$, forms a natural dimensionless parameter that quantifies the separation of scales. We define this scale-separation parameter as:\n$$ \\eta = \\frac{a}{R} $$\nThis parameter must be small, $\\eta \\ll 1$, for the first-order homogenization to be valid.\n\nThe problem then provides a model for the relative error, $\\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{rel}}$, in a macroscopic quantity of interest (such as homogenized stiffness or stress) which arises from neglecting the strain gradient. This error is given by the inequality:\n$$ \\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{rel}} \\leq C\\,\\eta $$\nwith the constant $C$ specified as $C = 1$. Thus, the error model simplifies to:\n$$ \\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{rel}} \\leq \\eta $$\nA design tolerance is specified, requiring that the relative error must not exceed a value $\\delta = 3.0 \\times 10^{-2}$. This imposes the following constraint:\n$$ \\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{rel}} \\le \\delta $$\nCombining this design constraint with the error model, we obtain the condition that must be satisfied for the homogenization scheme to be considered sufficiently accurate:\n$$ \\eta \\le \\delta $$\nThe maximum admissible value of the scale-separation parameter, $\\eta_{\\max}$, is the value at which this inequality is saturated.

The volume average $\\hat{C}(L)$ behaves like the sample mean of $N_{\\mathrm{eff}}$ approximately independent random variables, each with variance $\\sigma^2$. The standard CLT states that the variance of a sample mean of $N$ variables is the pointwise variance divided by $N$. Applying this principle here:\n$$\n\\mathrm{Var}[\\hat{C}(L)] \\approx \\frac{\\text{pointwise variance}}{N_{\\mathrm{eff}}} = \\frac{\\sigma^2}{L^d/V_c} = \\frac{\\sigma^2 V_c}{L^d}\n$$\nThis provides a physical justification for the $L^{-d}$ scaling and confirms our integral evaluation.\n\nNow, we can find the coefficient of variation, $\\mathrm{CoV}[\\hat{C}(L)]$:\n$$\n\\mathrm{CoV}[\\hat{C}(L)] = \\frac{\\sqrt{\\mathrm{Var}[\\hat{C}(L)]}}{\\mathbb{E}[\\hat{C}(L)]} \\approx \\frac{\\sqrt{\\frac{\\sigma^2 V_c}{L^d}}}{\\mu} = \\frac{\\sigma}{\\mu} \\sqrt{\\frac{V_c}{L^d}}\n$$\nUsing the definition of the pointwise coefficient of variation, $\\beta = \\sigma/\\mu$, we get:\n$$\n\\mathrm{CoV}[\\hat{C}(L)] \\approx \\beta \\left( \\frac{V_c}{L^d} \\right)^{1/2}\n$$\nThis is the asymptotic scaling of the CoV with $L$.\n\nFinally, we establish the RVE criterion for a side length $L = L_{\\mathrm{RVE}}(\\epsilon)$ by setting the CoV to be less than or equal to a prescribed small tolerance $\\epsilon$. To find the minimum size, we use equality:\n$$\n\\mathrm{CoV}[\\hat{C}(L_{\\mathrm{RVE}})] = \\beta \\left( \\frac{V_c}{L_{\\mathrm{RVE}}^d} \\right)^{1/2} = \\epsilon\n$$\nWe now solve for $L_{\\mathrm{RVE}}$. Restoring the tensor indices $ijkl$:\n$$\n\\beta_{ijkl} \\left( \\frac{V_{c}^{(ijkl)}}{L_{\\mathrm{RVE}}^d} \\right)^{1/2} = \\epsilon\n$$\nSquaring both sides:\n$$\n(\\beta_{ijkl})^2 \\frac{V_{c}^{(ijkl)}}{L_{\\mathrm{RVE}}^d} = \\epsilon^2\n$$\nRearranging to solve for $L_{\\mathrm{RVE}}^d$:\n$$\nL_{\\mathrm{RVE}}^d = V_{c}^{(ijkl)} \\frac{(\\beta_{ijkl})^2}{\\epsilon^2} = V_{c}^{(ijkl)} \\left(\\frac{\\beta_{ijkl}}{\\epsilon}\\right)^2\n$$\nTaking the $d$-th root of both sides provides the final expression for the RVE side length:\n$$\nL_{\\mathrm{RVE}}(\\epsilon) = \\left[ V_{c}^{(ijkl)} \\left(\\frac{\\beta_{ijkl}}{\\epsilon}\\right)^2 \\right]^{1/d}\n$$\nThis expression quantitatively defines the minimum size of a hypercubic volume element such that its averaged stiffness property is representative of the ensemble average property to within a statistical tolerance $\\epsilon$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\left[ V_{c}^{(ijkl)} \\left(\\frac{\\beta_{ijkl}}{\\epsilon}\\right)^2 \\right]^{\\frac{1}{d}}}\n$$", "id": "2913631"}]}
