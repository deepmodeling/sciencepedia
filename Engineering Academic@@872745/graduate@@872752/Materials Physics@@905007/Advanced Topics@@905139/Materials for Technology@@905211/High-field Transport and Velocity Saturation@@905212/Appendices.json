I will proceed with the derivation.\n\nThe starting point is the nonparabolic dispersion relation for an electron in the conduction band, given by the Kane model:\n$$E\\left(1+\\alpha E\\right)=\\frac{\\hbar^{2}k^{2}}{2m^{*}_{0}}$$\nHere, $E$ is the electron kinetic energy, $k$ is the wavevector magnitude, $\\alpha$ is the nonparabolicity parameter, and $m^{*}_{0}$ is the band-edge conductivity effective mass.\n\nTo find the group velocity $v$, we must first compute the derivative $\\frac{\\partial E}{\\partial k}$. We differentiate the dispersion relation implicitly with respect to $k$, recognizing that $E$ is a function of $k$.\n$$\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial k}\\left(E+\\alpha E^{2}\\right) = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial k}\\left(\\frac{\\hbar^{2}k^{2}}{2m^{*}_{0}}\\right)$$\nApplying the chain rule to the left side and differentiating the right side yields:\n$$\\left(1+2\\alpha E\\right)\\frac{\\partial E}{\\partial k} = \\frac{\\hbar^{2}}{2m^{*}_{0}}(2k) = \\frac{\\hbar^{2}k}{m^{*}_{0}}$$\nSolving for $\\frac{\\partial E}{\\partial k}$, we obtain:\n$$\\frac{\\partial E}{\\partial k} = \\frac{\\hbar^{2}k}{m^{*}_{0}\\left(1+2\\alpha E\\right)}$$\nThe group velocity $v$ is defined as $v=\\frac{1}{\\hbar}\\frac{\\partial E}{\\partial k}$. Substituting our expression for $\\frac{\\partial E}{\\partial k}$:\n$$v = \\frac{1}{\\hbar}\\left(\\frac{\\hbar^{2}k}{m^{*}_{0}\\left(1+2\\alpha E\\right)}\\right) = \\frac{\\hbar k}{m^{*}_{0}\\left(1+2\\alpha E\\right)}$$\nThe problem defines the energy-dependent conductivity effective mass, $m^{*}(E)$, through the relation $v=\\frac{\\hbar k}{m^{*}(E)}$. By comparing this definition with our derived expression for the group velocity, we can identify $m^{*}(E)$:\n$$\\frac{\\hbar k}{m^{*}(E)} = \\frac{\\hbar k}{m^{*}_{0}\\left(1+2\\alpha E\\right)}$$\nThis immediately gives the expression for the energy-dependent effective mass:\n$$m^{*}(E) = m^{*}_{0}\\left(1+2\\alpha E\\right)$$\nTo find the ratio $\\frac{m^{*}(E)}{m^{*}(0)}$, we first evaluate $m^{*}(E)$ at the conduction-band minimum, where $E=0$.\n$$m^{*}(0) = m^{*}_{0}\\left(1+2\\alpha(0)\\right) = m^{*}_{0}$$\nThis confirms that $m^{*}_{0}$ is indeed the effective mass at the band edge, as its name implies.

Hot electrons are carriers that have gained significant kinetic energy from a strong applied electric field, such that their energy $E$ is much greater than the thermal energy $k_B T$. Our derived relation $m^{*}(E) = m^{*}_{0}(1+2\\alpha E)$ demonstrates that the effective mass of an electron increases linearly with its kinetic energy.\nAccording to the semiclassical equation of motion, an electron's acceleration is inversely proportional to its mass. As an electron is accelerated by a high field and gains energy, its effective mass increases. This increased inertia makes the electron progressively more difficult to accelerate further. Consequently, the mobility $\\mu$, which relates drift velocity to the electric field and is inversely dependent on effective mass (e.g., in the Drude model, $\\mu=q\\tau_p/m^{*}$), decreases for high-energy electrons. This effect is a primary cause of velocity saturation, a phenomenon where the average drift velocity of carriers in a semiconductor ceases to increase with the electric field, approaching a constant limiting value at very high fields. The energy-dependence of the effective mass is therefore a critical factor limiting the performance of electronic devices operating under high-field conditions.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{1.2}$$", "id": "2482447"}, {"introduction": "Having established that an electron's properties can change at high energies, we now explore a direct consequence: velocity saturation.

For all test cases, the exponent $\\beta-\\alpha \\le 0$, which ensures that for large $T_{e}$, the linear term $-C_{2}T_{e}$ dominates and $f(T_{e})$ becomes negative.\nThe derivative of the function is $f'(T_{e}) = C_{1}(\\beta - \\alpha)T_{e}^{\\beta-\\alpha-1} - C_{2}$. For the given parameters where $\\beta - \\alpha \\le 0$, $f'(T_e) < 0$ for all $T_{e} \\ge T_{L}$, indicating that $f(T_{e})$ is a monotonically decreasing function in the domain of interest.\nTherefore, a unique root for $T_{e} > T_{L}$ is guaranteed to exist. A robust bracketing root-finder, such as the Brent-Dekker method, is suitable for finding this root.
