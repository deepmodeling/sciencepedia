This field marks the threshold at which it becomes energetically favorable for the first magnetic flux vortex to penetrate the superconductor. The criterion for this transition is that the change in the appropriate thermodynamic potential, upon introducing a single vortex, is zero. For a process at a fixed external magnetic field $\\mathbf{H}$ and temperature, the relevant potential is the Gibbs free energy, $G$.\n\nIn Gaussian units, the Gibbs free energy of a magnetic body in an external field $\\mathbf{H}$ is given by $G = F - \\frac{1}{4\\pi} \\int_V \\mathbf{H} \\cdot \\mathbf{B} \\, dV$, where $F$ is the Helmholtz free energy and $\\mathbf{B}$ is the magnetic induction inside the material. We consider a long, straight vortex line of length $L$ and calculate the change in Gibbs free energy, $\\Delta G$, when it is introduced into a sample that was initially in the Meissner state (where $\\mathbf{B}=0$ everywhere inside).\n\nThe change in Gibbs free energy is $\\Delta G = G_{vortex} - G_{Meissner}$.\nThe Meissner state has magnetic induction $\\mathbf{B}=0$ inside the bulk, so its magnetic contribution to the Gibbs energy (relative to the zero-field superconducting state) is $G_{Meissner} = F_{Meissner}$.\nWhen one vortex is present, the Helmholtz free energy increases by the vortex self-energy, $F_{vortex} = F_{Meissner} + L\\varepsilon_{vortex}$, where $\\varepsilon_{vortex}$ is the self-energy per unit length of the vortex. The local magnetic induction is now $\\mathbf{b}(\\mathbf{r})$, the field of the vortex itself. The change in Gibbs free energy is therefore:\n$$ \\Delta G = (F_{Meissner} + L\\varepsilon_{vortex}) - \\frac{1}{4\\pi}\\int_V \\mathbf{H} \\cdot \\mathbf{b} \\, dV - F_{Meissner} $$\nSince the applied field $\\mathbf{H}$ is uniform and parallel to the vortex axis (let's say the $z$-axis), the integral becomes $\\mathbf{H} \\cdot \\int_V \\mathbf{b} \\, dV = H \\hat{\\mathbf{z}} \\cdot (L \\int_S \\mathbf{b} \\, d^2r)$, where the integral is over the cross-sectional area $S$. The integral $\\int_S \\mathbf{b} \\cdot \\hat{\\mathbf{z}} \\, d^2r$ is the total magnetic flux $\\Phi$ carried by the vortex. This flux is quantized: $\\Phi = \\phi_0 = \\frac{hc}{2e}$.\n\nThe change in Gibbs free energy per unit length of the vortex, $\\Delta g = \\Delta G/L$, is thus:\n$$ \\Delta g = \\varepsilon_{vortex} - \\frac{H \\phi_0}{4\\pi} $$\nThe lower critical field $H_{c1}$ is defined as the applied field $H$ at which $\\Delta g = 0$.\n$$ 0 = \\varepsilon_{vortex} - \\frac{H_{c1} \\phi_0}{4\\pi} \\implies H_{c1} = \\frac{4\\pi \\varepsilon_{vortex}}{\\phi_0} $$\nThe core of the problem reduces to calculating the vortex line energy $\\varepsilon_{vortex}$. This energy is composed of the kinetic energy of the circulating supercurrents and the energy of the associated magnetic field. We analyze this within the London model, which is valid for distances $r$ from the vortex core such that $r \\gg \\xi$, where $\\xi$ is the coherence length. For a type-II superconductor, $\\kappa = \\lambda/\\xi \\gg 1$, so this model is applicable over a wide range of distances.\n\nIn the London limit, the magnetic induction $\\mathbf{b}$ of a single vortex line along the $z$-axis is described by the equation:\n$$ \\mathbf{b} - \\lambda^2 \\nabla^2 \\mathbf{b} = \\phi_0 \\delta^{(2)}(\\mathbf{r}) \\hat{\\mathbf{z}} $$\nwhere $\\lambda$ is the London penetration depth and $\\delta^{(2)}(\\mathbf{r})$ is the two-dimensional Dirac delta function, representing the flux-carrying singularity at the vortex core. For cylindrical symmetry, where $\\mathbf{b} = b(r)\\hat{\\mathbf{z}}$, the equation for $r0$ is a modified Bessel equation. The physically acceptable solution, which decays as $r \\to \\infty$, is:\n$$ b(r) = \\frac{\\phi_0}{2\\pi\\lambda^2} K_0\\left(\\frac{r}{\\lambda}\\right) $$\nwhere $K_0$ is the modified Bessel function of the second kind of order zero.\n\nThe Helmholtz free energy per unit length, $\\varepsilon_{vortex}$, is the integral of the energy density over the sample cross-section. The energy density consists of the magnetic field energy and the supercurrent kinetic energy. In the London model, this can be expressed as:\n$$ \\varepsilon_{vortex} = \\int \\left[ \\frac{b^2}{8\\pi} + \\frac{\\lambda^2}{8\\pi}(\\nabla \\times \\mathbf{b})^2 \\right] d^2r $$\nThe London model and the expression for $b(r)$ are singular at $r=0$ and are only valid for $r \\gg \\xi$.

The energy of the core, $\\varepsilon_{core}$, for $r \\le \\xi$, where the order parameter is suppressed.\n\nWe calculate $\\varepsilon_{out}$ by integrating the energy density from $r=\\xi$ to infinity.\n$$ \\varepsilon_{out} = \\int_{\\xi}^{\\infty} 2\\pi r dr \\frac{1}{8\\pi} \\left[ b(r)^2 + \\lambda^2|\\nabla \\times \\mathbf{b}|^2 \\right] $$\nUsing $|\\nabla \\times \\mathbf{b}| = |\\frac{db}{dr}|$ and the property of Bessel functions $\\frac{d}{dx}K_0(x) = -K_1(x)$, we have $|\\nabla \\times \\mathbf{b}| = \\frac{\\phi_0}{2\\pi\\lambda^3} K_1(\\frac{r}{\\lambda})$.\n$$ \\varepsilon_{out} = \\frac{1}{4} \\left(\\frac{\\phi_0}{2\\pi\\lambda^2}\\right)^2 \\int_{\\xi}^{\\infty} r dr \\left[ K_0^2\\left(\\frac{r}{\\lambda}\\right) + K_1^2\\left(\\frac{r}{\\lambda}\\right) \\right] $$\nA known integral identity is $\\int x(K_0^2(x)+K_1^2(x))dx = -xK_0(x)K_1(x)$.

This logarithmic term arises from the slow decay of the fields and currents far from the vortex core.\n\nThe core energy, $\\varepsilon_{core}$, accounts for the energy cost of suppressing the superconducting order parameter to zero at the center of the vortex. A detailed calculation requires the full Ginzburg-Landau theory. However, for large $\\kappa$, this contribution is small compared to the logarithmically large $\\varepsilon_{out}$. It is standard practice to treat its contribution to the total energy as an additive constant. This is physically justified because $\\varepsilon_{core}$ is proportional to the condensation energy density $H_c^2/8\\pi$ integrated over the core volume $\\sim \\pi\\xi^2$, which results in a term of the form $(\\frac{\\phi_0}{4\\pi\\lambda})^2 \\times (\\text{constant})$. The problem statement instructs us to encapsulate this short-distance physics in a dimensionless constant $c$ of order unity.\n\nThe total line energy of the vortex is the sum of the two contributions:\n$$ \\varepsilon_{vortex} = \\varepsilon_{out} + \\varepsilon_{core} = \\left(\\frac{\\phi_0}{4\\pi\\lambda}\\right)^2 (\\ln\\kappa + c) $$\nThe principal approximations made are:\n1.  **London Limit**: The use of the London model is valid for a type-II superconductor where $\\kappa = \\lambda/\\xi \\gg 1$, as the fields and currents extend over a region of size $\\lambda$ which is much larger than the core size $\\xi$.\n2.  **Core Energy Approximation**: Treating the core energy as a constant term $c$ is a valid leading-order approximation for large $\\kappa$, where the $\\ln\\kappa$ term is dominant. The constant $c$ absorbs the complexities of the core structure.\n\nFinally, we substitute the expression for $\\varepsilon_{vortex}$ into the formula for $H_{c1}$:\n$$ H_{c1} = \\frac{4\\pi}{\\phi_0} \\varepsilon_{vortex} = \\frac{4\\pi}{\\phi_0} \\left(\\frac{\\phi_0}{4\\pi\\lambda}\\right)^2 (\\ln\\kappa + c) $$\n$$ H_{c1} = \\frac{4\\pi}{\\phi_0} \\frac{\\phi_0^2}{16\\pi^2\\lambda^2} (\\ln\\kappa + c) $$\nSimplifying this expression yields the final result for the lower critical field:\n$$ H_{c1} = \\frac{\\phi_0}{4\\pi\\lambda^2} (\\ln\\kappa + c) $$\nThis expression shows that the field required to introduce a vortex depends on the fundamental flux quantum $\\phi_0$, the macroscopic length scales $\\lambda$ and $\\kappa = \\lambda/\\xi$, and a constant $c$ that accounts for the core physics.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{\\phi_{0}}{4\\pi\\lambda^{2}} (\\ln\\kappa + c)}$$", "id": "3021307"}]}
