The derivation must be based on fundamental principles of Ginzburg-Landau (GL) theory and London electrodynamics.\n\nThe state of a superconductor is described by a complex order parameter, $\\psi(\\mathbf{r})$, where $|\\psi(\\mathbf{r})|^2$ is proportional to the density of superconducting charge carriers (Cooper pairs). The behavior of $\\psi$ and the magnetic field is governed by the GL equations, which are derived from minimizing the GL free energy functional. Two fundamental length scales emerge from this theory: the coherence length $\\xi$, over which $\\psi$ can vary significantly, and the London penetration depth $\\lambda$, the characteristic length for the decay of magnetic fields inside the superconductor. Their ratio defines the Ginzburg-Landau parameter, $\\kappa = \\lambda/\\xi$.\n\nLet us begin with the upper critical induction, $\\mu_{0}H_{c2}$. This is the field at which superconductivity is destroyed by the external magnetic field, marking the transition from the mixed (vortex) state to the normal state. At this transition, the order parameter $\\psi$ is infinitesimally small. We can therefore use the linearized GL equation, which neglects higher-order terms in $\\psi$:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{2m^*} (-i\\hbar\\nabla - q\\mathbf{A})^2 \\psi = -\\alpha \\psi\n$$\nHere, $q=2e$ and $m^*=2m_e$ are the charge and effective mass of a Cooper pair, respectively, $\\mathbf{A}$ is the magnetic vector potential, and $\\alpha$ is a temperature-dependent GL coefficient. At $T=0$, $\\alpha$ is a negative constant. The coherence length $\\xi$ is defined by the relation $\\xi^2 = -\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2m^*\\alpha}$. Substituting this into the linearized GL equation gives:\n$$\n\\frac{-\\hbar^2}{2m^*\\xi^2} (-i\\nabla - \\frac{2e}{\\hbar}\\mathbf{A})^2 \\psi = \\psi\n$$\nThis equation is formally identical to the time-independent Schrödinger equation for a particle of charge $2e$ and mass $m^*$ in a uniform magnetic field $\\mathbf{B} = \\nabla \\times \\mathbf{A}$. The eigenvalues of the kinetic energy operator on the left-hand side are the Landau levels:\n$$\nE_n = (n + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega_c\n$$\nwhere $\\omega_c = \\frac{qB}{m^*} = \\frac{2eB}{m^*}$ is the cyclotron frequency. A non-trivial solution for $\\psi$ exists only if $-\\alpha$ is equal to one of these energy eigenvalues. To find the maximum possible field $B=B_{c2}=\\mu_0 H_{c2}$ that can sustain superconductivity, we must consider the lowest possible energy state, which corresponds to the ground state $n=0$.\n$$\n-\\alpha = E_0 = \\frac{1}{2}\\hbar\\omega_c = \\frac{1}{2}\\hbar\\frac{2eB_{c2}}{m^*} = \\frac{\\hbar e B_{c2}}{m^*}\n$$\nNow, we express $-\\alpha$ in terms of the coherence length $\\xi(0)$: $-\\alpha = \\frac{\\hbar^2}{2m^*\\xi(0)^2}$. Equating the two expressions for $-\\alpha$ yields:\n$$\n\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2m^*\\xi(0)^2} = \\frac{\\hbar e B_{c2}(0)}{m^*}\n$$\nSolving for $B_{c2}(0) = \\mu_0 H_{c2}(0)$, we get:\n$$\n\\mu_0 H_{c2}(0) = \\frac{\\hbar}{2e\\xi(0)^2}\n$$\nThe magnetic flux quantum is defined as $\\Phi_0 = h/(2e) = 2\\pi\\hbar/(2e)$. Therefore, $\\hbar/(2e) = \\Phi_0/(2\\pi)$. Substituting this, we arrive at the expression for the upper critical induction:\n$$\n\\mu_0 H_{c2}(0) = \\frac{\\Phi_0}{2\\pi\\xi(0)^2}\n$$\n\nNext, we derive the expression for the lower critical induction, $\\mu_{0}H_{c1}$. This is the field at which it first becomes energetically favorable for magnetic flux to penetrate the superconductor in the form of a quantized vortex line. Each vortex carries a single flux quantum, $\\Phi_0$. The condition for the entry of the first vortex is that the change in the Gibbs free energy per unit length, $\\Delta \\mathcal{G}$, upon creating the vortex is zero or negative.\n$$\n\\Delta \\mathcal{G} = \\epsilon_L - B \\cdot M_{Meissner} \\cdot (\\text{Area}) \\rightarrow \\Delta \\mathcal{G} = \\epsilon_L - \\Phi_0 H\n$$\nThe term $\\epsilon_L$ is the self-energy per unit length of the vortex line, representing the energy cost of its creation. The term $\\Phi_0 H$ represents the work done by the external field $H$ as one flux quantum $\\Phi_0$ enters the sample. At the critical field $H_{c1}$, this energy balance is at equilibrium, so $\\Delta \\mathcal{G} = 0$, which gives the relation:\n$$\n\\epsilon_L = \\Phi_0 H_{c1}\n$$\nThe line energy $\\epsilon_L$ arises from the kinetic energy of the circulating supercurrents and the energy of the trapped magnetic field. For a Type II superconductor with a large Ginzburg-Landau parameter ($\\kappa \\gg 1$), we can use London theory to estimate this energy. The energy per unit length stored in the magnetic field and supercurrents outside the vortex core (of radius $\\sim \\xi$) is found by integrating the energy density from $r=\\xi$ to $r=\\infty$. This gives the dominant, logarithmic term:\n$$\n\\epsilon_{L, \\text{outside}} \\approx \\frac{\\Phi_0^2}{4\\pi\\mu_0\\lambda^2} \\ln\\left(\\frac{\\lambda}{\\xi}\\right) = \\frac{\\Phi_0^2}{4\\pi\\mu_0\\lambda^2} \\ln(\\kappa)\n$$\nThe problem specifies using \"the standard core-energy correction\". The normal-state core of the vortex has an energy cost associated with the loss of condensation energy. This core energy contribution adds a constant term to the line energy expression. A widely accepted approximation for the total line energy for large $\\kappa$ is:\n$$\n\\epsilon_L \\approx \\frac{\\Phi_0^2}{4\\pi\\mu_0\\lambda^2} (\\ln\\kappa + C)\n$$\nwhere $C$ is a constant of order unity. We will use the standard value $C \\approx 0.5$.\nSubstituting this into our energy balance equation $\\Phi_0 H_{c1} = \\epsilon_L$, we find:\n$$\n\\Phi_0 H_{c1}(0) = \\frac{\\Phi_0^2}{4\\pi\\mu_0\\lambda(0)^2} (\\ln\\kappa + 0.5)\n$$\nSolving for the lower critical induction $B_{c1}(0) = \\mu_0 H_{c1}(0)$:\n$$\n\\mu_0 H_{c1}(0) = \\frac{\\Phi_0}{4\\pi\\lambda(0)^2} (\\ln\\kappa(0) + 0.5)\n$$\nwhere $\\kappa(0) = \\lambda(0)/\\xi(0)$.\n\nNow, we perform the numerical evaluation for the given material with $\\lambda(0) = 120\\,\\mathrm{nm}$ and $\\xi(0) = 10.0\\,\\mathrm{nm}$. We use the value $\\Phi_0 = 2.067833848 \\times 10^{-15}\\,\\mathrm{T\\cdot m^2}$.\n\nFirst, we calculate the Ginzburg-Landau parameter $\\kappa(0)$:\n$$\n\\kappa(0) = \\frac{\\lambda(0)}{\\xi(0)} = \\frac{120\\,\\mathrm{nm}}{10.0\\,\\mathrm{nm}} = 12.0\n$$\nThe type of superconductivity is determined by $\\kappa$. A superconductor is Type I if $\\kappa  1/\\sqrt{2}$ and Type II if $\\kappa  1/\\sqrt{2}$. Since $1/\\sqrt{2} \\approx 0.707$, our value of $\\kappa = 12.0$ indicates that the material is a Type II superconductor. Therefore, the parameter $n$ in the final answer is $n=2$.\n\nNext, we calculate the upper critical induction $\\mu_0 H_{c2}(0)$:\n$$\n\\mu_0 H_{c2}(0) = \\frac{\\Phi_0}{2\\pi\\xi(0)^2} = \\frac{2.067833848 \\times 10^{-15}\\,\\mathrm{T\\cdot m^2}}{2\\pi (10.0 \\times 10^{-9}\\,\\mathrm{m})^2} = \\frac{2.067833848 \\times 10^{-15}}{2\\pi \\times 1.00 \\times 10^{-16}}\\,\\mathrm{T}\n$$\n$$\n\\mu_0 H_{c2}(0) \\approx 3.29109\\,\\mathrm{T}\n$$\nRounding to four significant figures, we get $\\mu_0 H_{c2}(0) = 3.291\\,\\mathrm{T}$.\n\nFinally, we calculate the lower critical induction $\\mu_0 H_{c1}(0)$:\n$$\n\\mu_0 H_{c1}(0) = \\frac{\\Phi_0}{4\\pi\\lambda(0)^2} (\\ln(12.0) + 0.5)\n$$\nUsing $\\lambda(0) = 120 \\times 10^{-9}\\,\\mathrm{m}$ and $\\ln(12.0) \\approx 2.484907$:\n$$\n\\mu_0 H_{c1}(0) = \\frac{2.067833848 \\times 10^{-15}\\,\\mathrm{T\\cdot m^2}}{4\\pi (120 \\times 10^{-9}\\,\\mathrm{m})^2} (2.484907 + 0.5)\n$$\n$$\n\\mu_0 H_{c1}(0) = \\frac{2.067833848 \\times 10^{-15}}{4\\pi \\times 1.44 \\times 10^{-14}} (2.984907)\\,\\mathrm{T} \\approx 0.034109\\,\\mathrm{T}\n$$\nRounding to four significant figures, we get $\\mu_0 H_{c1}(0) = 0.03411\\,\\mathrm{T}$.\n\nThe final results are $\\mu_0 H_{c1}(0) = 0.03411\\,\\mathrm{T}$, $\\mu_0 H_{c2}(0) = 3.291\\,\\mathrm{T}$, and the material is Type II ($n=2$).", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 0.03411  3.291  2 \\end{pmatrix}}\n$$", "id": "2869191"}, {"introduction": "The hallmark of a Type II superconductor is the formation of a mixed state, where an external magnetic field penetrates the material as a regular array of quantized flux vortices.

There are no contradictions, ambiguities, or missing data. All assumptions are standard idealizations in the physics of superconductivity. Therefore, the problem is valid, and a solution will be presented.\n\nThe problem requires the derivation of the intervortex distance, or lattice constant $a$, in a triangular Abrikosov vortex lattice as a function of the magnetic induction $B$.\n\nFirst, we address the relationship between the macroscopic magnetic induction $B$ and the microscopic vortex structure. According to the problem statement, the magnetic field is uniform, and the total magnetic flux passing through an area $A$ is given by $\\Phi = BA$. In a type II superconductor in the mixed state, this flux is carried by a quantized number of vortices, $N_v$. Each vortex carries a single magnetic flux quantum, $\\Phi_0$. Thus, the total flux is also $\\Phi = N_v \\Phi_0$. By equating these two expressions for the total flux, we find $BA = N_v \\Phi_0$.\n\nThe areal density of vortices, $n_v$, is defined as the number of vortices per unit area, $n_v = N_v/A$. From the previous relation, we obtain the expression for the vortex areal density as provided in the problem statement:\n$$ n_v = \\frac{B}{\\Phi_0} $$\n\nNext, we must relate this physical quantity $n_v$ to the geometric properties of the vortex lattice. The problem specifies that the vortices form a perfect two-dimensional triangular lattice. The lattice constant $a$ is the distance between any two nearest-neighbor vortices. In a triangular lattice, the primitive unit cell, which contains exactly one lattice point (one vortex), is a rhombus with side length $a$ and internal angles of $\\frac{\\pi}{3}$ radians ($60^\\circ$) and $\\frac{2\\pi}{3}$ radians ($120^\\circ$).\n\nThe area of this primitive unit cell, $A_{\\text{cell}}$, can be calculated using the formula for the area of a parallelogram: $|\\vec{v}_1 \\times \\vec{v}_2|$, where $\\vec{v}_1$ and $\\vec{v}_2$ are the primitive lattice vectors. For a triangular lattice with spacing $a$, we can define these vectors as $\\vec{v}_1 = (a, 0)$ and $\\vec{v}_2 = (a \\cos(\\frac{\\pi}{3}), a \\sin(\\frac{\\pi}{3})) = (a/2, a\\sqrt{3}/2)$. The area of the cell is then the magnitude of the determinant of the matrix formed by these vectors:\n$$ A_{\\text{cell}} = \\left| \\det \\begin{pmatrix} a  a/2 \\\\ 0  a\\sqrt{3}/2 \\end{pmatrix} \\right| = \\left| a \\cdot \\frac{a\\sqrt{3}}{2} - 0 \\cdot \\frac{a}{2} \\right| = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} a^2 $$\nThe areal density of vortices, $n_v$, is the reciprocal of the area per vortex. Since there is one vortex per primitive cell, $n_v$ is the reciprocal of $A_{\\text{cell}}$:\n$$ n_v = \\frac{1}{A_{\\text{cell}}} = \\frac{1}{\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}a^2} = \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{3}a^2} $$\nNow we have two expressions for $n_v$.

One specimen is a clean, isotropic type I superconductor; the other is a clean, isotropic type II superconductor with weak pinning. Both samples are shaped so that, along the field direction, they are well-approximated as ellipsoids. The measurements are performed at fixed low temperature, in conditions where surface barriers and irreversible effects can be neglected, and the Meissner response is reversible until the onset of flux entry. The magnetic response is recorded as the magnetization $M$ versus the applied field $H_{\\mathrm{a}}$. The demagnetization factor $N$ (dimensionless, along the field axis) is known for each ellipsoid from its geometry, with $0 \\le N \\le 1$.\n\nStarting only from magnetostatics and the defining properties of superconducting states (perfect diamagnetism in the Meissner state for both types, and the existence of a thermodynamic critical field $H_{\\mathrm{c}}$ for type I; a lower critical field $H_{\\mathrm{c1}}$ for the onset of vortices and an upper critical field $H_{\\mathrm{c2}}$ for the destruction of superconductivity for type II), reason how the sample geometry affects the measured $M(H_{\\mathrm{a}})$ curves and how to transform the data to obtain intrinsic material parameters.\n\nWhich of the following statements are correct?\n\nA. In the Meissner state of either a type I or a type II superconductor, an ellipsoidal sample exhibits a linear relation between $M$ and $H_{\\mathrm{a}}$ with slope $\\mathrm{d}M/\\mathrm{d}H_{\\mathrm{a}} = -1/(1-N)$, so that a larger $N$ makes the measured diamagnetic slope more negative in magnitude.\n\nB.

Thus, dividing the observed onset field by $(1-N)$ yields the corresponding intrinsic entry field.\n\nC. For a type II superconductor, the same $(1-N)$ rescaling used for the onset also applies to the upper critical field: the intrinsic $H_{\\mathrm{c2}}$ is obtained by dividing the applied field where $M$ vanishes by $(1-N)$.\n\nD.

The intrinsic properties of the material are described by the relationship between $M$ and $H_{\\mathrm{i}}$, whereas experiments measure $M$ as a function of the controllable external field $H_{\\mathrm{a}}$.\n\n1.  **Meissner State (Type I and Type II):**\n    In the Meissner state, the superconductor exhibits perfect diamagnetism, expelling the magnetic flux density from its interior. The condition is $B_{\\mathrm{i}} = 0$. In a system of units where $B = \\mu_0 (H+M)$, this implies a relationship between the internal field and magnetization: $H_{\\mathrm{i}} + M = 0$, or $M = -H_{\\mathrm{i}}$.\n    Substituting this into the magnetostatic relation:\n    $$H_{\\mathrm{i}} = H_{\\mathrm{a}} - N(-H_{\\mathrm{i}}) = H_{\\mathrm{a}} + N H_{\\mathrm{i}}$$\n    Solving for $H_{\\mathrm{i}}$ gives:\n    $$H_{\\mathrm{i}}(1 - N) = H_{\\mathrm{a}} \\implies H_{\\mathrm{i}} = \\frac{H_{\\mathrm{a}}}{1 - N}$$\n    The measured magnetization $M$ as a function of the applied field $H_{\\mathrm{a}}$ is therefore:\n    $$M = -H_{\\mathrm{i}} = -\\frac{H_{\\mathrm{a}}}{1 - N}$$\n    This linear relationship holds for both superconductor types as long as they are in the Meissner state.

The problem states we can neglect surface barriers, so the relevant fields are the bulk critical fields.\n    - For a Type I superconductor, this occurs when $H_{\\mathrm{i}}$ reaches the thermodynamic critical field, $H_{\\mathrm{c}}$. The sample enters the intermediate state. The corresponding applied field, $H_{\\mathrm{a}}^{\\mathrm{on}}$, is found by setting $H_{\\mathrm{i}} = H_{\\mathrm{c}}$ in the expression from the Meissner state:\n      $$H_{\\mathrm{c}} = \\frac{H_{\\mathrm{a}}^{\\mathrm{on}}}{1 - N} \\implies H_{\\mathrm{a}}^{\\mathrm{on}} = (1 - N) H_{\\mathrm{c}}$$\n    - For a Type II superconductor, this occurs when $H_{\\mathrm{i}}$ reaches the lower critical field, $H_{\\mathrm{c1}}$. The sample enters the mixed (vortex) state. The logic is identical:\n      $$H_{\\mathrm{c1}} = \\frac{H_{\\mathrm{a}}^{\\mathrm{on}}}{1 - N} \\implies H_{\\mathrm{a}}^{\\mathrm{on}} = (1 - N) H_{\\mathrm{c1}}$$\n\n3.  **Upper Critical Field $H_{\\mathrm{c2}}$ (Type II):**\n    The upper critical field $H_{\\mathrm{c2}}$ is defined as the field at which superconductivity is completely destroyed and the material becomes normal. At this transition, the magnetization $M$ vanishes.\n    At the transition point, $M=0$. The general magnetostatic relation $H_{\\mathrm{i}} = H_{\\mathrm{a}} - N M$ simplifies to:\n    $$H_{\\mathrm{i}} = H_{\\mathrm{a}} - N(0) = H_{\\mathrm{a}}$$\n    The physical condition for the transition is that the internal field must equal the intrinsic upper critical field, $H_{\\mathrm{i}} = H_{\\mathrm{c2}}$. Therefore, the measured applied field at which the transition occurs is exactly $H_{\\mathrm{c2}}$:\n    $$H_{\\mathrm{a}} = H_{\\mathrm{c2}}$$\n    The demagnetization factor does not affect the measurement of $H_{\\mathrm{c2}}$.\n\n4.  **Intermediate State (Type I):**\n    For an ellipsoid in the intermediate state, the internal field $H_{\\mathrm{i}}$ is pinned at the thermodynamic critical field, $H_{\\mathrm{i}} = H_{\\mathrm{c}}$. This state exists for applied fields in the range $(1-N)H_{\\mathrm{c}} \\le H_{\\mathrm{a}} \\le H_{\\mathrm{c}}$. Using the magnetostatic relation:\n    $$H_{\\mathrm{c}} = H_{\\mathrm{a}} - N M$$\n    Solving for the magnetization $M$ as a function of the applied field $H_{\\mathrm{a}}$ yields:\n    $$N M = H_{\\mathrm{a}} - H_{\\mathrm{c}} \\implies M(H_{\\mathrm{a}}) = \\frac{H_{\\mathrm{a}} - H_{\\mathrm{c}}}{N} = \\frac{1}{N} H_{\\mathrm{a}} - \\frac{H_{\\mathrm{c}}}{N}$$\n    This shows a linear dependence of $M$ on $H_{\\mathrm{a}}$ with a slope of $1/N$.\n\n**Option-by-Option Analysis**\n\n**A. In the Meissner state of either a type I or a type II superconductor, an ellipsoidal sample exhibits a linear relation between $M$ and $H_{\\mathrm{a}}$ with slope $\\mathrm{d}M/\\mathrm{d}H_{\\mathrm{a}} = -1/(1-N)$, so that a larger $N$ makes the measured diamagnetic slope more negative in magnitude.**\nAs derived, in the Meissner state, $M(H_{\\mathrm{a}}) = -H_{\\mathrm{a}}/(1-N)$. The slope is indeed $\\mathrm{d}M/\\mathrm{d}H_{\\mathrm{a}} = -1/(1-N)$. The magnitude of this slope is $|-1/(1-N)| = 1/(1-N)$. Since $0 \\le N  1$, as $N$ increases, the denominator $(1-N)$ decreases, causing the magnitude $1/(1-N)$ to increase. An increased magnitude of a negative slope means it becomes more negative (e.g., from $-2$ to $-5$). The statement is correct.\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\n**B. The applied field at which flux first enters the sample is reduced by geometry: for a type I superconductor it occurs at $H_{\\mathrm{a}}^{\\mathrm{on}} = (1-N)\\,H_{\\mathrm{c}}$, and for a type II superconductor it occurs at $H_{\\mathrm{a}}^{\\mathrm{on}} = (1-N)\\,H_{\\mathrm{c1}}$ (neglecting surface barriers). Thus, dividing the observed onset field by $(1-N)$ yields the corresponding intrinsic entry field.**\nOur derivation shows that the onset applied field is indeed $H_{\\mathrm{a}}^{\\mathrm{on}} = (1-N)H_{\\mathrm{c}}$ for type I and $H_{\\mathrm{a}}^{\\mathrm{on}} = (1-N)H_{\\mathrm{c1}}$ for type II. Since $N  0$ for any non-infinite needle shape, the factor $(1-N)$ is less than $1$, so the onset field is reduced. To find the intrinsic field ($H_{\\mathrm{c}}$ or $H_{\\mathrm{c1}}$) from the measured onset field $H_{\\mathrm{a}}^{\\mathrm{on}}$, one must compute $H_{\\mathrm{a}}^{\\mathrm{on}} / (1-N)$. This is precisely what the statement claims.\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\n**C. For a type II superconductor, the same $(1-N)$ rescaling used for the onset also applies to the upper critical field: the intrinsic $H_{\\mathrm{c2}}$ is obtained by dividing the applied field where $M$ vanishes by $(1-N)$.**\nOur analysis of the $H_{\\mathrm{c2}}$ transition shows that because $M=0$ at this point, the internal field equals the applied field: $H_{\\mathrm{i}} = H_{\\mathrm{a}}$. The intrinsic transition occurs at $H_{\\mathrm{i}} = H_{\\mathrm{c2}}$, which means the measured applied field is directly $H_{\\mathrm{a}} = H_{\\mathrm{c2}}$. No rescaling is necessary. The statement's claim that one must divide the observed field by $(1-N)$ is false.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**D. A general geometry correction valid beyond the Meissner regime is to reconstruct the internal magnetic field $H_{\\mathrm{i}}$ from the data using $H_{\\mathrm{i}} = H_{\\mathrm{a}} - N\\,M(H_{\\mathrm{a}})$ at each measurement point and then replot $M$ as a function of $H_{\\mathrm{i}}$. This procedure collapses the curves onto the intrinsic $M(H)$ of the material (for an ellipsoid in reversible equilibrium), restoring the correct positions of $H_{\\mathrm{c}}$, $H_{\\mathrm{c1}}$, and $H_{\\mathrm{c2}}$ on the field axis.**\nThe intrinsic physics of a material relates its response (magnetization $M$) to the field it actually experiences (internal field $H_{\\mathrm{i}}$). The function $M(H_{\\mathrm{i}})$ is the fundamental material property. The relation $H_{\\mathrm{i}} = H_{\\mathrm{a}} - N M$ is a general magnetostatic result for ellipsoids, valid as long as $M$ is uniform, which is the case for reversible states in an ellipsoid. Therefore, taking measured data pairs $(H_{\\mathrm{a}}, M)$ and computing $H_{\\mathrm{i}}$ for each point allows one to reconstruct the intrinsic $M(H_{\\mathrm{i}})$ curve from the experimental $M(H_{\\mathrm{a}})$ curve. This is the standard and correct procedure for correcting for demagnetization effects. It correctly places all critical fields ($H_{\\mathrm{c}}$, $H_{\\mathrm{c1}}$, $H_{\\mathrm{c2}}$) at their intrinsic values on the new field axis $H_{\\mathrm{i}}$.\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\n**E. In the type I intermediate state of an ellipsoidal sample, $M(H_{\\mathrm{a}})$ between the onset of flux entry and the fully normal state is independent of $N$ because the superconducting domains screen the field locally, making the macroscopic demagnetization irrelevant.**\nOur derivation for the intermediate state showed that $M(H_{\\mathrm{a}}) = (H_{\\mathrm{a}} - H_{\\mathrm{c}})/N$. This expression clearly shows that the magnetization is dependent on the demagnetization factor $N$. Specifically, the slope of the $M(H_{\\mathrm{a}})$ curve in this region is $1/N$. The premise that local screening makes the macroscopic effect irrelevant is a physical misinterpretation; the average magnetization over the entire sample volume is what generates the demagnetizing field. The statement is false.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{ABD}$$", "id": "2869235"}]}
