In a two-dimensional system of area $A$, the allowed wavevectors $\\mathbf{k}$ form a grid in k-space. The area per state (including spin) is given by $(2\\pi)^2/A$. Accounting for a spin degeneracy of $g_s$, the density of states in k-space is uniform.\n\nThe number of states $d N$ within an infinitesimal annulus in k-space, from radius $k$ to $k+dk$, is given by the area of the annulus, $2\\pi k \\, dk$, multiplied by the density of states in k-space:\n$$\ndN = g_s \\frac{A}{(2\\pi)^2} (2\\pi k \\, dk) = g_s \\frac{A}{2\\pi} k \\, dk\n$$\nThe energy dispersion relation is given as $\\varepsilon = \\frac{\\hbar^2 k^2}{2 m^\\ast}$. We can relate energy and wavevector. Differentiating this expression gives:\n$$\nd\\varepsilon = \\frac{\\hbar^2 (2k)}{2 m^\\ast} dk = \\frac{\\hbar^2 k}{m^\\ast} dk \\implies k \\, dk = \\frac{m^\\ast}{\\hbar^2} d\\varepsilon\n$$\nSubstituting this into the expression for $dN$:\n$$\ndN = g_s \\frac{A}{2\\pi} \\left( \\frac{m^\\ast}{\\hbar^2} d\\varepsilon \\right) = \\frac{g_s A m^\\ast}{2\\pi \\hbar^2} d\\varepsilon\n$$\nThe density of states, $D(\\varepsilon) = dN/d\\varepsilon$, is therefore constant for a 2DEG:\n$$\nD(\\varepsilon) = \\frac{g_s A m^\\ast}{2\\pi \\hbar^2}\n$$\nGiven $g_s=2$, this simplifies to:\n$$\nD(\\varepsilon) = \\frac{A m^\\ast}{\\pi \\hbar^2}\n$$\nAt zero temperature ($T=0$), electrons occupy all available energy states up to the Fermi energy, $E_F$. The total number of electrons, $N$, is the integral of the DOS up to $E_F$:\n$$\nN = \\int_0^{E_F} D(\\varepsilon) d\\varepsilon = \\int_0^{E_F} \\frac{A m^\\ast}{\\pi \\hbar^2} d\\varepsilon = \\frac{A m^\\ast}{\\pi \\hbar^2} E_F\n$$\nThe areal density is $n=N/A$. Thus, we have the relation:\n$$\nn = \\frac{N}{A} = \\frac{m^\\ast}{\\pi \\hbar^2} E_F\n$$\nSolving for the Fermi energy in terms of the density $n$:\n$$\nE_F = \\frac{\\pi \\hbar^2 n}{m^\\ast}\n$$\nThe total kinetic energy, $E$, of the system is the integral of the energy of each state, $\\varepsilon$, multiplied by the number of states at that energy, $D(\\varepsilon) d\\varepsilon$, up to the Fermi energy:\n$$\nE = \\int_0^{E_F} \\varepsilon D(\\varepsilon) d\\varepsilon = \\int_0^{E_F} \\varepsilon \\left( \\frac{A m^\\ast}{\\pi \\hbar^2} \\right) d\\varepsilon = \\frac{A m^\\ast}{\\pi \\hbar^2} \\left[ \\frac{\\varepsilon^2}{2} \\right]_0^{E_F} = \\frac{A m^\\ast}{2\\pi \\hbar^2} E_F^2\n$$\nThe kinetic energy per particle is $E/N$:\n$$\n\\frac{E}{N} = \\frac{\\frac{A m^\\ast}{2\\pi \\hbar^2} E_F^2}{\\frac{A m^\\ast}{\\pi \\hbar^2} E_F} = \\frac{1}{2} E_F\n$$\nSubstituting the expression for $E_F$ in terms of $n$, we obtain the final result for part (a):\n$$\n\\frac{E}{N} = \\frac{1}{2} \\left( \\frac{\\pi \\hbar^2 n}{m^\\ast} \\right) = \\frac{\\pi \\hbar^2 n}{2 m^\\ast}\n$$\n\n**(b) Density-Scaling Exponents $\\alpha_{2\\mathrm{D}}$ and $\\alpha_{3\\mathrm{D}}$**\n\nFor the 2DEG, the result from part (a) is $\\frac{E}{N} = \\left(\\frac{\\pi \\hbar^2}{2 m^\\ast}\\right) n$. This is a relationship of the form $E/N \\propto n^{\\alpha_{2\\mathrm{D}}}$. By direct inspection, the exponent is:\n$$\n\\alpha_{2\\mathrm{D}} = 1\n$$\nFor the 3DEG, we perform an analogous derivation. The number of states up to a Fermi wavevector $k_F$ is $N = g_s \\frac{V}{(2\\pi)^3} (\\frac{4}{3}\\pi k_F^3)$, where $V$ is the volume. The volume density is $n_{3\\mathrm{D}} = N/V$, so $n_{3\\mathrm{D}} \\propto k_F^3$, which implies $k_F \\propto n_{3\\mathrm{D}}^{1/3}$.\nThe Fermi energy is $E_F = \\frac{\\hbar^2 k_F^2}{2m^\\ast}$, so $E_F \\propto k_F^2 \\propto (n_{3\\mathrm{D}}^{1/3})^2 = n_{3\\mathrm{D}}^{2/3}$.\nThe energy per particle for a 3DEG is found to be $E/N = \\frac{3}{5}E_F$. Therefore, the energy per particle scales with density as:\n$$\n\\frac{E}{N} \\propto E_F \\propto n_{3\\mathrm{D}}^{2/3}\n$$\nThe problem uses $n$ to denote density generically. Thus, the scaling exponent for the 3D case is:\n$$\n\\alpha_{3\\mathrm{D}} = \\frac{2}{3}\n$$\nThe three quantities to be reported are the energy per particle for the 2DEG, $\\alpha_{2\\mathrm{D}}$, and $\\alpha_{3\\mathrm{D}}$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{\\pi \\hbar^2 n}{2 m^\\ast} & 1 & \\frac{2}{3} \\end{pmatrix}}\n$$", "id": "3022937"}, {"introduction": "While we often model a 2DEG as being confined to a single electronic subband, this is only an approximation valid at low carrier densities. This exercise delves into the quantum mechanical origins of the 2DEG by considering its confinement within a quantum well, which creates a ladder of discrete subbands. You will calculate the critical carrier density at which electrons begin to populate the second subband, a crucial threshold that marks the limit of the strictly two-dimensional approximation and is vital for device engineering.

The in-plane dispersion in each subband is $E = E_n + \\hbar^2 k^2/(2 m^*)$, where $E_n$ is the $n$-th subband minimum, and the two-dimensional density of states per subband for a parabolic band is energy-independent.

It is a standard problem in the physics of low-dimensional electron systems. We shall proceed with its formal derivation.\n\nThe system is a two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) confined along one dimension in an infinitely deep square quantum well of width $L$. The electron energy spectrum consists of a series of subbands, where for each subband $n$ (with $n = 1, 2, 3, \\ldots$), the energy dispersion is given by:\n$$E(k) = E_n + \\frac{\\hbar^2 k^2}{2 m^*}$$\nHere, $E_n$ is the energy minimum of the $n$-th subband, $m^*$ is the effective mass, and $k$ is the magnitude of the in-plane wavevector.\n\nThe problem states that the two-dimensional density of states (DOS) for a single subband is constant with respect to energy. To be rigorous, we first derive this. The number of states $dN$ in k-space within an annulus of radius $k$ and thickness $dk$ is proportional to the area of this annulus, $2\\pi k \\, dk$. For a system of area $A$, the number of states per unit area is $\\frac{2\\pi k \\, dk}{(2\\pi)^2/A} = \\frac{A k \\, dk}{2\\pi}$. The density of states per unit energy, per unit area is $D(E) = \\frac{1}{A} \\frac{dN}{dE} = \\frac{1}{A} \\frac{dN}{dk} \\frac{dk}{dE}$. From the dispersion relation, $E - E_n = \\frac{\\hbar^2 k^2}{2m^*}$, we find $k = \\frac{\\sqrt{2m^*(E-E_n)}}{\\hbar}$. Differentiating gives $\\frac{dE}{dk} = \\frac{\\hbar^2 k}{m^*}$, so $\\frac{dk}{dE} = \\frac{m^*}{\\hbar^2 k}$.\nSubstituting this into the expression for the DOS:\n$$D(E) = \\frac{1}{A} \\frac{A k}{2\\pi} \\left(\\frac{m^*}{\\hbar^2 k}\\right) = \\frac{m^*}{2\\pi\\hbar^2}$$\nThis is indeed a constant for $E \\ge E_n$. This DOS is for one spin state and one valley. Accounting for spin degeneracy $g_s$ and valley degeneracy $g_v$, the total DOS for the $n$-th subband is:\n$$D_n(E) = g_s g_v \\frac{m^*}{2\\pi\\hbar^2} \\quad \\text{for } E \\ge E_n$$\nand $D_n(E) = 0$ for $E < E_n$. This can be written compactly using the Heaviside step function $\\Theta(x)$ as $D_n(E) = g_s g_v \\frac{m^*}{2\\pi\\hbar^2} \\Theta(E - E_n)$.\n\nAt zero temperature ($T=0$), electrons occupy all available energy states up to the Fermi energy, $E_F$. The sheet carrier density in the $n$-th subband, $n_n$, is obtained by integrating the subband DOS from its minimum $E_n$ up to $E_F$:\n$$n_n = \\int_{E_n}^{E_F} D_n(E) dE = \\int_{E_n}^{E_F} g_s g_v \\frac{m^*}{2\\pi\\hbar^2} dE$$\nSince the integrand is constant over the integration range, this yields:\n$$n_n = g_s g_v \\frac{m^*}{2\\pi\\hbar^2} (E_F - E_n), \\quad \\text{for } E_F \\ge E_n$$\nIf $E_F < E_n$, the subband is empty and $n_n = 0$. The total sheet carrier density $n_s$ is the sum over all occupied subbands: $n_s = \\sum_n n_n$.\n\nThe problem asks for the critical sheet density $n_{s,\\mathrm{crit}}$ at which the second subband ($n=2$) begins to populate. This occurs precisely when the Fermi energy $E_F$ becomes equal to the energy minimum of the second subband, $E_2$.\n$$E_F = E_2$$\nAt this critical point, only the subbands with energy minima $E_n \\le E_2$ can be populated. In this case, this includes the first subband ($n=1$) and the second subband ($n=2$). However, for the second subband, the occupancy $n_2$ is:\n$$n_2 = g_s g_v \\frac{m^*}{2\\pi\\hbar^2} (E_F - E_2) = g_s g_v \\frac{m^*}{2\\pi\\hbar^2} (E_2 - E_2) = 0$$\nThus, at the onset of its population, the second subband contains zero electrons. All higher subbands ($n > 2$) are also empty. Therefore, the total carrier density $n_s$ is comprised entirely of electrons in the first subband:\n$$n_{s,\\mathrm{crit}} = n_1$$\nWe calculate $n_1$ by setting $E_F = E_2$ in its population formula:\n$$n_{s,\\mathrm{crit}} = g_s g_v \\frac{m^*}{2\\pi\\hbar^2} (E_2 - E_1)$$\nThe subband energies for an infinite quantum well of width $L$ are given as:\n$$E_n = E_c + \\frac{\\hbar^2 \\pi^2 n^2}{2 m^* L^2}$$\nwhere $E_c$ is a constant reference energy.

The effective mass $m^*$ cancels. The reduced Planck constant squared $\\hbar^2$ cancels. One factor of $\\pi$ in the numerator cancels with the $\\pi$ in the denominator. This yields the final expression:\n$$n_{s,\\mathrm{crit}} = g_s g_v \\frac{1}{2} \\left( \\frac{3\\pi}{2 L^2} \\right) = \\frac{3\\pi g_s g_v}{4 L^2}$$\nThis result shows that the critical density is determined only by the quantum well width $L$ and the degeneracies $g_s$ and $g_v$, and is independent of the effective mass $m^*$.
