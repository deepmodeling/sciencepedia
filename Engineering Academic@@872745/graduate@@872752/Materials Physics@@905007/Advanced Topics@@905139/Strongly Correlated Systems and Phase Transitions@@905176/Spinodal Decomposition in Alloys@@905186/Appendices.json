The forward Euler scheme is unconditionally unstable for these growing modes. The problem deliberately circumvents this well-known difficulty by restricting the analysis to the physically stable (decaying) modes. This does not invalidate the problem; it makes it a focused exercise on a specific aspect of the numerical analysis. The problem is self-contained and free of contradictions.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. A rigorous solution will be developed.\n\n**Task 1: Linearization of the Cahn-Hilliard Equation**\nThe Cahn-Hilliard equation is given by\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial c}{\\partial t} = \\nabla \\cdot (M \\nabla \\mu) = M \\nabla^2 \\mu\n$$\nsince $M$ is a constant. The chemical potential is $\\mu = f'(c) - \\kappa \\nabla^2 c$.

The partial derivatives become $\\frac{\\partial c}{\\partial t} = \\frac{\\partial \\phi}{\\partial t}$ and $\\nabla^n c = \\nabla^n \\phi$ for $n0$. The equation for $\\phi$ is\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial \\phi}{\\partial t} = M \\nabla^2 f'(c_0 + \\phi) - M\\kappa \\nabla^4 \\phi.\n$$\nFor small $\\phi$, we perform a Taylor expansion of $f'(c_0 + \\phi)$ about $c_0$ and keep terms up to first order in $\\phi$:\n$$\nf'(c_0 + \\phi) \\approx f'(c_0) + f''(c_0) \\phi.\n$$\nSubstituting this into the equation for $\\phi$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial \\phi}{\\partial t} = M \\nabla^2 (f'(c_0) + f''(c_0) \\phi) - M\\kappa \\nabla^4 \\phi.\n$$\nSince $f'(c_0)$ is a constant, its Laplacian is zero, $\\nabla^2 f'(c_0) = 0$.

Let $\\phi_{\\mathbf{i}}^n$ be the value of $\\phi$ at grid point $\\mathbf{i}$ and time step $n$.

We consider a single Fourier mode of the form $\\phi_{\\mathbf{i}}^n = (G(\\mathbf{k}))^n \\exp(I \\mathbf{k} \\cdot \\mathbf{x}_{\\mathbf{i}})$, where $\\mathbf{k}$ is the wavevector, $\\mathbf{x}_{\\mathbf{i}}$ is the position vector, $I=\\sqrt{-1}$, and $G(\\mathbf{k})$ is the amplification factor.\n\nThe action of the standard second-order central-difference Laplacian on this mode yields its eigenvalue $\\hat{L}(\\mathbf{k})$:\n$$\n\\mathcal{L}_d(\\exp(I \\mathbf{k} \\cdot \\mathbf{x}_{\\mathbf{i}})) = \\hat{L}(\\mathbf{k}) \\exp(I \\mathbf{k} \\cdot \\mathbf{x}_{\\mathbf{i}}),\n$$\nwith\n$$\n\\hat{L}(\\mathbf{k}) = \\sum_{j=1}^d \\frac{\\exp(I k_j \\Delta x) + \\exp(-I k_j \\Delta x) - 2}{(\\Delta x)^2} = \\frac{2}{(\\Delta x)^2}\\sum_{j=1}^d (\\cos(k_j\\Delta x) - 1) = -\\frac{4}{(\\Delta x)^2}\\sum_{j=1}^d \\sin^2\\left(\\frac{k_j \\Delta x}{2}\\right).\n$$\nSubstituting the Fourier mode into the discrete equation gives an expression for the amplification factor:\n$$\n\\frac{G(\\mathbf{k}) - 1}{\\Delta t} = M f''(c_0) \\hat{L}(\\mathbf{k}) - M\\kappa (\\hat{L}(\\mathbf{k}))^2.\n$$\nLet $P(\\mathbf{k}) = M f''(c_0) \\hat{L}(\\mathbf{k}) - M\\kappa (\\hat{L}(\\mathbf{k}))^2$. Then $G(\\mathbf{k}) = 1 + \\Delta t P(\\mathbf{k})$. For linear stability, we require $|G(\\mathbf{k})| \\le 1$, which for real $P(\\mathbf{k})$ is $-2 \\le \\Delta t P(\\mathbf{k}) \\le 0$.\n\nA discrete mode is decaying if its growth rate $P(\\mathbf{k})$ is negative. This corresponds to the physically stable modes. For such modes, the condition $\\Delta t P(\\mathbf{k}) \\le 0$ is satisfied for any $\\Delta t  0$. The stability is thus governed by the condition $\\Delta t P(\\mathbf{k}) \\ge -2$, or $\\Delta t \\le -2/P(\\mathbf{k})$. This must hold for all decaying modes. The most restrictive condition comes from the mode with the most negative (minimum) value of $P(\\mathbf{k})$, so we require $\\Delta t \\le -2/\\min_{\\mathbf{k}} P(\\mathbf{k})$, where the minimum is taken over all decaying modes.\n\nLet $S(\\mathbf{k}) = \\sum_{j=1}^d \\sin^2(k_j\\Delta x/2)$. The range of $S$ is $[0, d]$. We can write $\\hat{L}(\\mathbf{k}) = - \\frac{4}{(\\Delta x)^2} S(\\mathbf{k})$.

This is a downward-opening parabola in $S$. Decaying modes are those for which $P(S)  0$, which occurs when $S  \\frac{|f''(c_0)|(\\Delta x)^2}{4\\kappa}$. The vertex of the parabola is at $S_{vertex} = \\frac{|f''(c_0)|(\\Delta x)^2}{8\\kappa}$, which is less than the threshold for decaying modes. On the interval corresponding to decaying modes, $P(S)$ is a strictly decreasing function of $S$. Thus, its minimum occurs at the maximum possible value of $S$, which is $S_{max}=d$. This corresponds to the highest-frequency mode, where $k_j\\Delta x = \\pi$ for all $j=1, \\dots, d$.\n\nThe minimum value of $P(S)$ is therefore\n$$\nP_{min} = P(d) = \\frac{4d M |f''(c_0)|}{(\\Delta x)^2} - \\frac{16d^2 M \\kappa}{(\\Delta x)^4}.\n$$\nThe stability condition is $\\Delta t \\le -2/P_{min}$:\n$$\n\\Delta t \\le \\frac{-2}{\\frac{4d M |f''(c_0)|}{(\\Delta x)^2} - \\frac{16d^2 M \\kappa}{(\\Delta x)^4}} = \\frac{2}{\\frac{16d^2 M \\kappa}{(\\Delta x)^4} - \\frac{4d M |f''(c_0)|}{(\\Delta x)^2}}.\n$$\nFactoring the denominator gives the general stability condition:\n$$\n\\Delta t \\le \\frac{2(\\Delta x)^4}{4d M (4d \\kappa - |f''(c_0)|(\\Delta x)^2)} = \\frac{(\\Delta x)^4}{2d M (4d \\kappa - |f''(c_0)|(\\Delta x)^2)}.\n$$\n\n**Task 3: Calculation of Maximum Time Step**\nWe use the derived condition for $d=2$:\n$$\n\\Delta t_{\\max} = \\frac{(\\Delta x)^4}{4 M (8 \\kappa - |f''(c_0)|(\\Delta x)^2)}.\n$$\nThe given parameters are:\n- $M = 1.0 \\times 10^{-14} \\ \\mathrm{m}^{5}/(\\mathrm{J}\\,\\mathrm{s})$\n- $\\kappa = 1.0 \\times 10^{-10} \\ \\mathrm{J}/\\mathrm{m}$\n- $|f''(c_0)| = |-5.0 \\times 10^{7}| = 5.0 \\times 10^{7} \\ \\mathrm{J}/\\mathrm{m}^{3}$\n- $\\Delta x = 1.0 \\times 10^{-9} \\ \\mathrm{m}$\n\nFirst, we compute the components of the expression.\nThe numerator is $(\\Delta x)^4 = (1.0 \\times 10^{-9} \\ \\mathrm{m})^4 = 1.0 \\times 10^{-36} \\ \\mathrm{m}^4$.\nThe terms in the denominator are:\n- $8 \\kappa = 8 \\times (1.0 \\times 10^{-10} \\ \\mathrm{J}/\\mathrm{m}) = 8.0 \\times 10^{-10} \\ \\mathrm{J}/\\mathrm{m}$.\n- $|f''(c_0)|(\\Delta x)^2 = (5.0 \\times 10^{7} \\ \\mathrm{J}/\\mathrm{m}^3) \\times (1.0 \\times 10^{-9} \\ \\mathrm{m})^2 = 5.0 \\times 10^7 \\times 1.0 \\times 10^{-18} \\ \\mathrm{J}/\\mathrm{m} = 5.0 \\times 10^{-11} \\ \\mathrm{J}/\\mathrm{m}$.\n- The term in parenthesis is $(8 \\kappa - |f''(c_0)|(\\Delta x)^2) = 8.0 \\times 10^{-10} - 0.5 \\times 10^{-10} = 7.5 \\times 10^{-10} \\ \\mathrm{J}/\\mathrm{m}$.\n- The full denominator is $4 M (7.5 \\times 10^{-10} \\ \\mathrm{J}/\\mathrm{m}) = 4 \\times (1.0 \\times 10^{-14} \\ \\mathrm{m}^5/(\\mathrm{J}\\,\\mathrm{s})) \\times (7.5 \\times 10^{-10} \\ \\mathrm{J}/\\mathrm{m}) = 30 \\times 10^{-24} \\ \\mathrm{m}^4/\\mathrm{s} = 3.0 \\times 10^{-23} \\ \\mathrm{m}^4/\\mathrm{s}$.\n\nNow, we compute the maximum time step:\n$$\n\\Delta t_{\\max} = \\frac{1.0 \\times 10^{-36} \\ \\mathrm{m}^4}{3.0 \\times 10^{-23} \\ \\mathrm{m}^4/\\mathrm{s}} = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 10^{-13} \\ \\mathrm{s} \\approx 0.3333... \\times 10^{-13} \\ \\mathrm{s}.\n$$\nExpressing this in standard scientific notation and rounding to three significant figures:\n$$\n\\Delta t_{\\max} = 3.33 \\times 10^{-14} \\ \\mathrm{s}.\n$$", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{3.33 \\times 10^{-14}}\n$$", "id": "2861283"}, {"introduction": "The ultimate test of a physical theory is its ability to describe and predict experimental results.

For example, the format is $[\\,\\kappa_{1},M_{0,1},\\kappa_{2},M_{0,2},\\kappa_{3},M_{0,3}\\,]$, where each entry is a decimal number with six significant figures.", "solution": "The problem statement has been validated and found to be scientifically sound, well-posed, and self-contained. It describes a standard data analysis task in the study of spinodal decomposition using the linearized Cahn-Hilliard theory. We will therefore proceed with a formal solution. The data provided, however, appear to be noise-free and constructed to yield exact integer or simple rational results for the model parameters, which is a pedagogical simplification not typical of real experimental data.\n\nThe fundamental objective is to extract the mobility coefficient $M_{0}$ and the gradient-energy coefficient $\\kappa$ from simulated small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) data. The theoretical framework is the Cahn-Hilliard equation, which describes the time evolution of a conserved order parameter, in this case, the composition field $c(\\mathbf{r}, t)$. The equation is a statement of local mass conservation, $\\frac{\\partial c}{\\partial t} = -\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{J}$, where the flux $\\mathbf{J}$ is taken to be proportional to the gradient of a generalized chemical potential $\\mu$: $\\mathbf{J} = -M \\nabla \\mu$. Here, $M$ is the mobility.\n\nThe chemical potential $\\mu$ is derived from the Ginzburg-Landau free-energy functional $F[c]$, which for an inhomogeneous system is given by:\n$$F[c] = \\int_V \\left( f(c) + \\frac{\\kappa}{2} (\\nabla c)^2 \\right) dV$$\nHere, $f(c)$ is the bulk free-energy density, and the term $\\frac{\\kappa}{2} (\\nabla c)^2$ penalizes sharp changes in composition, with $\\kappa  0$ being the gradient-energy coefficient. The chemical potential is the variational derivative of the free energy with respect to composition, $\\mu = \\frac{\\delta F}{\\delta c}$, which yields:\n$$\\mu = \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial c} - \\kappa \\nabla^2 c$$\nCombining these gives the full Cahn-Hilliard equation:\n$$\\frac{\\partial c}{\\partial t} = \\nabla \\cdot \\left( M \\left( \\nabla \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial c} - \\kappa \\nabla^3 c \\right) \\right)$$\nFor the early stages of spinodal decomposition, we consider small composition fluctuations $\\delta c(\\mathbf{r}, t) = c(\\mathbf{r}, t) - c_0$ around the average composition $c_0$. We linearize the equation by expanding $\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial c}$ around $c_0$ and assuming a constant mobility $M_0$. The term $\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial c}$ becomes $f'(c_0) + f''(c_0)\\delta c + \\dots$. The constant term $f'(c_0)$ has zero gradient and does not contribute to the dynamics. The linearized equation for the fluctuation $\\delta c$ is:\n$$\\frac{\\partial (\\delta c)}{\\partial t} = M_0 \\nabla^2(f''(c_0)\\delta c - \\kappa \\nabla^2 (\\delta c)) = M_0 f''(c_0) \\nabla^2 (\\delta c) - M_0 \\kappa \\nabla^4 (\\delta c)$$\nWe solve this linear partial differential equation by transforming to Fourier space. A fluctuation is decomposed into its Fourier modes $c_{\\mathbf{k}}(t)$: $\\delta c(\\mathbf{r}, t) = \\int c_{\\mathbf{k}}(t) e^{i\\mathbf{k}\\cdot\\mathbf{r}} d\\mathbf{k}$. The spatial derivatives become powers of the wavevector magnitude $k=|\\mathbf{k}|$: $\\nabla^2 \\rightarrow -k^2$ and $\\nabla^4 \\rightarrow k^4$. The equation for each mode $c_{\\mathbf{k}}(t)$ is:\n$$\\frac{d c_{\\mathbf{k}}}{dt} = \\left( -M_0 f''(c_0) k^2 - M_0 \\kappa k^4 \\right) c_{\\mathbf{k}}(t)$$\nThis is a first-order ordinary differential equation with solution $c_{\\mathbf{k}}(t) = c_{\\mathbf{k}}(0) \\exp(\\sigma(k)t)$, where the amplification factor or growth rate $\\sigma(k)$ is:\n$$\\sigma(k) = -M_0 k^2 (f''(c_0) + \\kappa k^2)$$\nSpinodal decomposition occurs inside the spinodal region of the phase diagram, where the bulk free energy has a negative curvature, i.e., $f''(c_0)  0$. This negative curvature provides the thermodynamic driving force for phase separation. We define the positive quantity $A \\equiv -f''(c_0)$. With this, the growth rate becomes:\n$$\\sigma(k) = M_0 k^2 (A - \\kappa k^2)$$\nThis is a quartic function of $k$. At low $k$, the growth is dominated by the $k^2$ term, and at high $k$, the $k^4$ term, representing the gradient energy penalty, dominates and suppresses growth.\n\nThe problem provides experimental data $g(k)$, defined as the slope of $\\ln I(k,t)$ with respect to time $t$. The scattered intensity $I(k,t)$ in a SAXS experiment is proportional to the structure factor, which for early times is proportional to $|c_{\\mathbf{k}}(t)|^2$. Thus:\n$$I(k,t) \\propto |c_{\\mathbf{k}}(t)|^2 \\propto |\\exp(\\sigma(k)t)|^2 = \\exp(2\\sigma(k)t)$$\nSo, $\\ln I(k,t) = \\ln I_0(k) + 2\\sigma(k)t$. The slope is $g(k) = \\frac{d}{dt}[\\ln I(k,t)] = 2\\sigma(k)$. Therefore, we obtain the experimental growth rate as $\\sigma(k) = g(k)/2$.\n\nOur task is to fit the theoretical model $\\sigma(k) = s_0k^2 - s_1k^4$ to these experimental $\\sigma(k)$ values, where we identify $s_0 = M_0 A$ and $s_1 = M_0 \\kappa$. This is a linear least-squares problem. For each data point $(k_i, \\sigma_i)$, we have an equation $\\sigma_i = s_0 k_i^2 - s_1 k_i^4$. Given a set of $N$ data points, we can construct the linear system $Y = X\\beta$, where $Y$ is the column vector of $\\sigma_i$ values, $X$ is the $N \\times 2$ design matrix with rows $[k_i^2, -k_i^4]$, and $\\beta$ is the vector of coefficients $[s_0, s_1]^T$. The solution $\\beta$ that minimizes the sum of squared residuals is given by $\\beta = (X^T X)^{-1} X^T Y$.\n\nOnce the parameters $s_0$ and $s_1$ are determined from the fit, we must find the wavenumber of the fastest growing mode, $k_m$, and its corresponding growth rate, $\\sigma_m$. These are found by maximizing $\\sigma(k)$:\n$$\\frac{d\\sigma}{dk} = \\frac{d}{dk}(s_0 k^2 - s_1 k^4) = 2s_0k - 4s_1k^3 = 2k(s_0 - 2s_1k^2) = 0$$\nThis yields the peak wavenumber $k_m = \\sqrt{\\frac{s_0}{2s_1}}$. The peak growth rate is then:\n$$\\sigma_m = \\sigma(k_m) = s_0 k_m^2 - s_1 k_m^4 = s_0\\left(\\frac{s_0}{2s_1}\\right) - s_1\\left(\\frac{s_0}{2s_1}\\right)^2 = \\frac{s_0^2}{2s_1} - \\frac{s_0^2}{4s_1} = \\frac{s_0^2}{4s_1}$$\nThe problem instructs us to use these fitted $k_m$ and $\\sigma_m$, along with the given value of $A$, to find $\\kappa$ and $M_0$. By substituting the definitions of $s_0$ and $s_1$ into the expressions for $k_m$ and $\\sigma_m$, we find the theoretical relations:\n$$k_m = \\sqrt{\\frac{M_0 A}{2 M_0 \\kappa}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{A}{2\\kappa}} \\quad \\implies \\quad \\kappa = \\frac{A}{2k_m^2}$$\n$$\\sigma_m = \\frac{(M_0 A)^2}{4 M_0 \\kappa} = \\frac{M_0 A^2}{4\\kappa}$$\nFrom the second relation, we can express $M_0$ as:\n$$M_0 = \\frac{4\\kappa\\sigma_m}{A^2} = \\frac{4\\left(\\frac{A}{2k_m^2}\\right)\\sigma_m}{A^2} = \\frac{2\\sigma_m}{A k_m^2}$$\nWe will apply this procedure to each of the three datasets provided.\n\nFor each dataset:\n$1$. The experimental data $g(k_i)$ are converted to $\\sigma_i = g(k_i)/2$.\n$2$. The parameters $s_0$ and $s_1$ are found by performing a linear least-squares fit of $\\sigma_i$ to the model $s_0 k_i^2 - s_1 k_i^4$.\n$3$. The peak wavenumber $k_m$ and growth rate $\\sigma_m$ are calculated from the fitted $s_0$ and $s_1$.\n$4$. The physical parameters $\\kappa$ and $M_0$ are calculated using the fitted $k_m$, $\\sigma_m$, and the provided value of $A$.\n$5$. The final values for $\\kappa$ and $M_0$ are rounded to six significant figures. All units must be consistent; with $k$ in $\\mathrm{nm^{-1}}$, $g(k)$ in $\\mathrm{s^{-1}}$, and $A$ in $\\mathrm{eV/nm^3}$, the resulting $\\kappa$ will be in $\\mathrm{eV/nm}$ and $M_0$ in $\\mathrm{nm^5/(eV \\cdot s)}$.", "answer": "```python\n# The complete and runnable Python 3 code goes here.\n# Imports must adhere to the specified execution environment.\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef format_sigfigs(num, sig_figs):\n    \"\"\"\n    Formats a number to a specified number of significant figures.\n    \"\"\"\n    if num == 0:\n        return '0.' + '0' * (sig_figs - 1)\n    \n    # Use scientific notation to find the order of magnitude\n    order_of_magnitude = np.floor(np.log10(abs(num)))\n    \n    # Number of decimal places needed for f-string formatting\n    decimal_places = sig_figs - 1 - int(order_of_magnitude)\n    \n    if decimal_places >= 0:\n        return f'{num:.{decimal_places}f}'\n    else:\n        # Handles cases where the number is large and rounding affects digits\n        # before the decimal point.\n        return f'{round(num, decimal_places):.0f}'\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves the problem for all test cases by fitting the Cahn-Hilliard\n    linear theory model to the provided SAXS data.\n    \"\"\"\n    test_cases = [\n        {\n            \"k_values\": np.array([0.05, 0.08, 0.10, 0.12, 0.16]),\n            \"g_values\": np.array([0.0004375, 0.0008704, 0.001, 0.0008064, -0.0014336]),\n            \"A\": 0.020\n        },\n        {\n            \"k_values\": np.array([0.01, 0.03, 0.045, 0.06, 0.09, 0.12]),\n            \"g_values\": np.array([0.0000156, 0.0001116, 0.0001598775, 0.0000576, -0.0013284, -0.0059904]),\n            \"A\": 0.008\n        },\n        {\n            \"k_values\": np.array([0.10, 0.16, 0.22, 0.30, 0.40]),\n            \"g_values\": np.array([0.0009, 0.00190464, 0.00249664, 0.0009, -0.0096]),\n            \"A\": 0.050\n        }\n    ]\n\n    results = []\n    \n    for case in test_cases:\n        k = case[\"k_values\"]\n        g = case[\"g_values\"]\n        A = case[\"A\"]\n\n        # Step 1: Calculate experimental sigma(k) from g(k)\n        # g(k) = 2 * sigma(k)\n        sigma = g / 2.0\n\n        # Step 2: Fit sigma(k) = s0*k^2 - s1*k^4 using linear least squares.\n        # This is equivalent to solving the linear system Y = X*beta for beta,\n        # where Y = sigma, X has columns k^2 and -k^4, and beta = [s0, s1]^T.\n        k_squared = k**2\n        k_quartic = k**4\n        \n        # Design matrix X for the model sigma = s0*(k^2) + s1*(-k^4)\n        X = np.vstack([k_squared, -k_quartic]).T\n\n        # Solve for coefficients [s0, s1]\n        try:\n            coeffs = np.linalg.lstsq(X, sigma, rcond=None)[0]\n            s0 = coeffs[0]\n            s1 = coeffs[1]\n        except np.linalg.LinAlgError:\n            # This case should not be reached with the given valid data.\n            results.extend([\"Error\", \"Error\"])\n            continue\n\n        # Step 3: Compute peak wavenumber k_m and peak growth rate sigma_m\n        if s0 = 0 or s1 = 0:\n            # Physically unrealistic parameters, cannot calculate k_m\n            results.extend([\"Error\", \"Error\"])\n            continue\n            \n        k_m_squared = s0 / (2.0 * s1)\n        sigma_m = s0**2 / (4.0 * s1)\n        \n        # Step 4: Extract kappa and M0 using the fitted k_m, sigma_m, and given A.\n        # kappa = A / (2 * k_m^2)\n        # M0 = 2 * sigma_m / (A * k_m^2)\n        kappa = A / (2.0 * k_m_squared)\n        M0 = (2.0 * sigma_m) / (A * k_m_squared)\n\n        # Step 5: Format results to six significant figures\n        kappa_str = format_sigfigs(kappa, 6)\n        M0_str = format_sigfigs(M0, 6)\n        \n        results.append(kappa_str)\n        results.append(M0_str)\n\n    # Final print statement in the exact required format.\n    print(f\"[{','.join(results)}]\")\n\nsolve()\n```", "id": "2861313"}]}
