We will address each lattice type systematically. The volume of the primitive cell is given by the formula $V_{p} = \\left|\\boldsymbol{a}_{1} \\cdot \\left(\\boldsymbol{a}_{2} \\times \\boldsymbol{a}_{3}\\right)\\right|$, where $\\{\\boldsymbol{a}_{1}, \\boldsymbol{a}_{2}, \\boldsymbol{a}_{3}\\}$ is a set of primitive vectors. This volume is also equal to the absolute value of the determinant of the matrix whose columns (or rows) are the components of the primitive vectors.\n\nPrimitive Cubic ($P$) Lattice\nThe primitive cubic lattice consists of points at the vertices of a conventional cubic cell of side length $a$. A lattice point is located at the origin of our coordinate system. A simple and convenient choice for the primitive vectors is to align them with the Cartesian axes, spanning the edges of the conventional cubic cell:\n$$\n\\boldsymbol{a}_{1} = a\\hat{\\boldsymbol{x}} = \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\n$$\n\\boldsymbol{a}_{2} = a\\hat{\\boldsymbol{y}} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ a \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\n$$\n\\boldsymbol{a}_{3} = a\\hat{\\boldsymbol{z}} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ a \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nAny lattice point in the $P$ lattice can be expressed as $\\boldsymbol{R} = m_{1}a\\hat{\\boldsymbol{x}} + m_{2}a\\hat{\\boldsymbol{y}} + m_{3}a\\hat{\\boldsymbol{z}}$ for integers $m_{1}, m_{2}, m_{3}$. With our choice of primitive vectors, this is simply $\\boldsymbol{R} = m_{1}\\boldsymbol{a}_{1} + m_{2}\\boldsymbol{a}_{2} + m_{3}\\boldsymbol{a}_{3}$, which perfectly matches the definition of a Bravais lattice generated by $\\{\\boldsymbol{a}_{1}, \\boldsymbol{a}_{2}, \\boldsymbol{a}_{3}\\}$. For this choice, the primitive cell is the conventional cubic cell itself.\n\nThe volume of the primitive cell, $V_{p,P}$, is:\n$$\nV_{p,P} = \\left|\\boldsymbol{a}_{1} \\cdot \\left(\\boldsymbol{a}_{2} \\times \\boldsymbol{a}_{3}\\right)\\right| = \\left| \\det \\begin{pmatrix} a & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & a & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & a \\end{pmatrix} \\right| = \\left|a^{3}\\right| = a^{3}\n$$\nThe dimensionless ratio $r_{P}$ is:\n$$\nr_{P} = \\frac{V_{p,P}}{a^{3}} = \\frac{a^{3}}{a^{3}} = 1\n$$\nThis is consistent with the fact that the conventional cell of a primitive lattice contains exactly one lattice point ($8$ corners $\\times \\frac{1}{8}$ per corner $= 1$).\n\nBody-Centered Cubic ($I$) Lattice\nThe body-centered cubic lattice has points at the corners of the conventional cubic cell and one additional point at the center of the cube, i.e., at coordinates $\\frac{a}{2}(\\hat{\\boldsymbol{x}} + \\hat{\\boldsymbol{y}} + \\hat{\\boldsymbol{z}})$ relative to a corner. A convenient set of primitive vectors connects the lattice point at the origin to three of the eight nearest-neighbor body-center points.

For example, the body-center point at $\\frac{a}{2}(\\hat{\\boldsymbol{x}} + \\hat{\\boldsymbol{y}} + \\hat{\\boldsymbol{z}})$ is generated by taking $n_1=1, n_2=1, n_3=1$, since $\\boldsymbol{a}_{1} + \\boldsymbol{a}_{2} + \\boldsymbol{a}_{3} = \\frac{a}{2}(\\hat{\\boldsymbol{x}} + \\hat{\\boldsymbol{y}} + \\hat{\\boldsymbol{z}})$. A corner point, e.g., at $a\\hat{\\boldsymbol{x}}$, is generated by $n_1=0, n_2=1, n_3=1$, since $\\boldsymbol{a}_{2} + \\boldsymbol{a}_{3} = \\frac{a}{2}(2\\hat{\\boldsymbol{x}}) = a\\hat{\\boldsymbol{x}}$.

A convenient set of primitive vectors connects the lattice point at the origin to the centers of the three faces that meet at that origin:\n$$\n\\boldsymbol{a}_{1} = \\frac{a}{2}(\\hat{\\boldsymbol{y}} + \\hat{\\boldsymbol{z}}) = \\frac{a}{2}\\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 1 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\n$$\n\\boldsymbol{a}_{2} = \\frac{a}{2}(\\hat{\\boldsymbol{x}} + \\hat{\\boldsymbol{z}}) = \\frac{a}{2}\\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\n$$\n\\boldsymbol{a}_{3} = \\frac{a}{2}(\\hat{\\boldsymbol{x}} + \\hat{\\boldsymbol{y}}) = \\frac{a}{2}\\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nTo justify this choice, we note that the face-center point at $\\frac{a}{2}(\\hat{\\boldsymbol{x}} + \\hat{\\boldsymbol{y}})$ is simply $\\boldsymbol{a}_{3}$ (with $n_1=0, n_2=0, n_3=1$). A corner point, e.g., at $a\\hat{\\boldsymbol{x}}$, is generated by the combination $-\\boldsymbol{a}_{1} + \\boldsymbol{a}_{2} + \\boldsymbol{a}_{3} = \\frac{a}{2}(-\\hat{\\boldsymbol{y}}-\\hat{\\boldsymbol{z}} + \\hat{\\boldsymbol{x}}+\\hat{\\boldsymbol{z}} + \\hat{\\boldsymbol{x}}+\\hat{\\boldsymbol{y}}) = \\frac{a}{2}(2\\hat{\\boldsymbol{x}}) = a\\hat{\\boldsymbol{x}}$ (with $n_1=-1, n_2=1, n_3=1$). Since all basis points of the conventional cell (corners and face-centers) can be reached, this set of vectors generates the entire $F$ lattice.\n\nThe volume of the primitive cell, $V_{p,F}$, is:\n$$\nV_{p,F} = \\left| \\det \\left( \\frac{a}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\right) \\right| = \\left(\\frac{a}{2}\\right)^{3} \\left| \\det \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\right|\n$$\nThe determinant evaluates to $0 - 1(0-1) + 1(1-0) = 1 + 1 = 2$.\n$$\nV_{p,F} = \\frac{a^{3}}{8} \\cdot |2| = \\frac{a^{3}}{4}\n$$\nThe dimensionless ratio $r_{F}$ is:\n$$\nr_{F} = \\frac{V_{p,F}}{a^{3}} = \\frac{a^{3}/4}{a^{3}} = \\frac{1}{4}\n$$\nThis is consistent with the fact that the conventional cell of an FCC lattice contains four lattice points ($1$ from corners $+ 6$ faces $\\times \\frac{1}{2}$ per face $= 4$).\n\nCombining the results, the ordered triple of ratios $(r_{P}, r_{I}, r_{F})$ is $(1, 1/2, 1/4)$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 1 & \\frac{1}{2} & \\frac{1}{4} \\end{pmatrix}}\n$$", "id": "2973745"}, {"introduction": "Experimental techniques like X-ray and electron diffraction probe the geometry of a crystal in reciprocal space, not direct space.

A basis $\\{\\mathbf{a}, \\mathbf{b}\\}$ is reduced if it satisfies the following two conditions:\n$1.$ $|\\mathbf{a}| \\le |\\mathbf{b}|$\n$2.$ $2|\\mathbf{a} \\cdot \\mathbf{b}| \\le |\\mathbf{a}|^2$\n\nFor our choice, $\\mathbf{a} = (0.52, 0)$ and $\\mathbf{b} = (0.26, 0.26\\sqrt{3})$.\nWe have $|\\mathbf{a}|^2 = 0.2704$ and $|\\mathbf{b}|^2 = 0.2704$.\nCondition 1: $|\\mathbf{a}| \\le |\\mathbf{b}|$ becomes $\\sqrt{0.2704} \\le \\sqrt{0.2704}$, which is true.\nCondition 2: We compute the scalar product $\\mathbf{a} \\cdot \\mathbf{b} = (0.52)(0.26) + (0)(0.26\\sqrt{3}) = 0.1352$.\nThe condition is $2|0.1352| \\le 0.2704$, which simplifies to $0.2704 \\le 0.2704$. This is also true.\nBoth conditions are satisfied. Therefore, the basis defined by $\\mathbf{a}_r = (0.52, 0)$ and $\\mathbf{b}_r = (0.26, 0.26\\sqrt{3})$ is a valid Minkowski-reduced primitive basis.\n\nNext, we classify the Bravais lattice. The classification depends on the relations between the lengths of the basis vectors and the angle between them.\nThe lengths are $|\\mathbf{a}_r| = \\sqrt{0.2704} = 0.52$ and $|\\mathbf{b}_r| = \\sqrt{0.2704} = 0.52$. Thus, $|\\mathbf{a}_r|=|\\mathbf{b}_r|$.\nThe angle $\\theta$ between $\\mathbf{a}_r$ and $\\mathbf{b}_r$ is determined by:\n$$ \\cos\\theta = \\frac{\\mathbf{a}_r \\cdot \\mathbf{b}_r}{|\\mathbf{a}_r||\\mathbf{b}_r|} = \\frac{0.1352}{(0.52)(0.52)} = \\frac{0.1352}{0.2704} = \\frac{1}{2} $$\nThis gives $\\theta = \\arccos(\\frac{1}{2}) = \\frac{\\pi}{3}$ radians, or $60^\\circ$.\nA two-dimensional lattice with primitive basis vectors of equal length and an inter-vector angle of $60^\\circ$ is by definition a hexagonal lattice.\n\nFinally, we compute the area $A$ of the primitive unit cell spanned by the reduced basis vectors $\\mathbf{a}_r = (a_x, a_y)$ and $\\mathbf{b}_r = (b_x, b_y)$. The area is given by the magnitude of the determinant of the matrix formed by these vectors:\n$$ A = |\\det(\\mathbf{a}_r, \\mathbf{b}_r)| = |a_x b_y - a_y b_x| $$\nSubstituting the components of our reduced basis:\n$$ A = |(0.52)(0.26\\sqrt{3}) - (0)(0.26)| = 0.52 \\times 0.26 \\times \\sqrt{3} = 0.1352\\sqrt{3} $$\nThe numerical value is required, rounded to four significant figures. Using $\\sqrt{3} \\approx 1.73205$:\n$$ A \\approx 0.1352 \\times 1.73205 \\approx 0.2341732... $$\nRounding to four significant figures gives $A \\approx 0.2342$. The units are $\\mathrm{nm}^2$.", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{0.2342} $$", "id": "2804121"}]}
