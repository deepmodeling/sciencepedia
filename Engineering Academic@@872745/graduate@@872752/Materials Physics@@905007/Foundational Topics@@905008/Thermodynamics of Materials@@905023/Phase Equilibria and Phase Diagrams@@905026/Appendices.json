No rounding is required.", "solution": "The problem requires the derivation of the Gibbs Phase Rule and its application to a specific binary system, followed by an interpretation of the phase diagram topology near a three-phase equilibrium point. We approach this problem with rigor, starting from first principles of chemical thermodynamics.\n\nFirst, we derive the general expression for the number of degrees of freedom, $F$, for a system in thermodynamic equilibrium. The degrees of freedom represent the number of independent intensive variables that can be changed simultaneously without altering the number of phases present.\n\nConsider a heterogeneous system containing $C$ chemically independent components distributed among $P$ distinct phases. The state of each phase is defined by its temperature $T$, pressure $p$, and the mole fractions of its components.\n\nThe total number of intensive variables required to describe the entire system is determined as follows:\n1.  The temperature $T$ and pressure $p$ are system-wide variables, common to all phases in thermal and mechanical equilibrium. This accounts for $2$ variables.\n2.  Within each phase, the composition is specified by the mole fractions of the components, $x_{i}^{\\phi}$, where $i$ denotes the component ($1, 2, ..., C$) and $\\phi$ denotes the phase ($1, 2, ..., P$). For each phase, the sum of mole fractions must be unity: $\\sum_{i=1}^{C} x_{i}^{\\phi} = 1$. Therefore, for each of the $P$ phases, we only need to specify $C-1$ mole fractions to fully define its composition.\n3.  The total number of independent composition variables for all $P$ phases is thus $P(C-1)$.\n\nCombining these, the total number of intensive variables to potentially specify is $V = P(C-1) + 2$.\n\nNext, we account for the constraints imposed by the condition of thermodynamic equilibrium. For multiple phases to coexist in equilibrium, the chemical potential, $\\mu_{i}^{\\phi}$, of each component $i$ must be equal in every phase $\\phi$. The chemical potential is defined as the partial molar Gibbs free energy, $\\mu_{i}^{\\phi} = \\left(\\frac{\\partial G^{\\phi}}{\\partial n_{i}^{\\phi}}\\right)_{T, p, n_{j \\neq i}}$.\n\nThe equilibrium conditions are:\n$$\\mu_{1}^{1} = \\mu_{1}^{2} = \\dots = \\mu_{1}^{P}$$\n$$\\mu_{2}^{1} = \\mu_{2}^{2} = \\dots = \\mu_{2}^{P}$$\n$$\\vdots$$\n$$\\mu_{C}^{1} = \\mu_{C}^{2} = \\dots = \\mu_{C}^{P}$$\n\nFor each component $i$, there are $P-1$ independent equations relating its chemical potentials across the $P$ phases. Since there are $C$ components, the total number of constraining equilibrium equations is $E = C(P-1)$.\n\nThe number of degrees of freedom, $F$, is the difference between the total number of variables and the number of constraints:\n$$F = V - E = [P(C-1) + 2] - [C(P-1)]$$\n$$F = PC - P + 2 - PC + C$$\n$$F = C - P + 2$$\nThis is the Gibbs Phase Rule for a system where both temperature and pressure are considered as potential variables.\n\nThe problem specifies a system under isobaric conditions, meaning the pressure $p$ is held constant. This imposes one additional constraint on the system, or equivalently, removes one variable from consideration. The resulting number of degrees of freedom, often called the reduced or condensed degrees of freedom $F'$, is:\n$$F' = F - 1 = (C - P + 2) - 1$$\n$$F' = C - P + 1$$\nThis reduced phase rule is applicable to condensed systems or any system where pressure is fixed, and the remaining variables are temperature and composition.\n\nWe now specialize to the case given in the problem: a binary system ($C=2$) with three phases in equilibrium ($P=3$) at a fixed pressure $p$. Applying the reduced phase rule:\n$$F' = 2 - 3 + 1$$\n$$F' = 0$$\n\nThe number of degrees of freedom is zero.\n\nThe interpretation of this result is as follows. A value of $F'=0$ signifies an invariant equilibrium. In the context of a temperature-composition ($T-x$) phase diagram constructed at constant pressure, this means that the three phases can coexist only at a single, uniquely determined temperature, the invariant temperature, $T_{inv}$. Furthermore, at this temperature, the compositions of each of the three coexisting phases are also fixed.\n\nLet the three phases be $\\alpha$, $\\beta$, and $\\gamma$. At $T_{inv}$, their compositions are fixed at $x_{\\alpha}$, $x_{\\beta}$, and $x_{\\gamma}$. On a $T-x$ diagram, this invariant equilibrium is represented by a horizontal line segment at $T=T_{inv}$. This line is often called a three-phase tie-line or an invariant reaction line. The endpoints of this line segment and one point within it correspond to the fixed compositions of the three phases. Any overall system composition that lies between the minimum and maximum of $\\{x_{\\alpha}, x_{\\beta}, x_{\\gamma}\\}$ at this temperature will separate into a mixture of these three phases. Thus, the locus of the three-phase equilibrium on a $T-x$ section is a line.\n\nThis invariant line serves as the boundary for adjacent two-phase regions. For any two phases to be in equilibrium (e.g., $\\alpha+\\beta$), the reduced phase rule gives $F' = C - P + 1 = 2 - 2 + 1 = 1$. This means that a two-phase equilibrium in a binary system at constant pressure has one degree of freedom; it can exist over a range of temperatures, with phase compositions changing along phase boundary lines (solvus, solidus, liquidus lines).\n\nThere are $\\binom{3}{2} = \\frac{3!}{2!1!} = 3$ possible two-phase equilibria that can be formed from the three phases: $\\alpha+\\beta$, $\\beta+\\gamma$, and $\\alpha+\\gamma$. These three two-phase regions meet at the invariant horizontal line. Consequently, the phase boundaries that define these two-phase regions must emanate from the three points on the invariant line corresponding to the compositions $x_{\\alpha}$, $x_{\\beta}$, and $x_{\\gamma}$. Arbitrarily close to, but not at, the invariant temperature, the system will be in one of these two-phase regions. Within these regions, the compositions of the two equilibrium phases are given by the intersections of a horizontal tie-line (at that temperature) with the phase boundaries. As the temperature approaches $T_{inv}$, these tie-lines converge toward the single invariant three-phase line, and the phase compositions approach their fixed values of $x_{\\alpha}$, $x_{\\beta}$, and $x_{\\gamma}$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0}$$", "id": "2847130"}, {"introduction": "While the Phase Rule dictates the geometry of equilibrium, the Gibbs free energy of mixing dictates its origin.

The solution is stable if the free energy curve is convex, i.e., if its second derivative is positive.
