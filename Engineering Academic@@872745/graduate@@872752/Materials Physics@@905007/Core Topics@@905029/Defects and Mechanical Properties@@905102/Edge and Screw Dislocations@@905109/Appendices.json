The configuration is stable when the magnitude of the horizontal separation $|x^{\\ast}|$ is equal to the vertical separation $s$. This corresponds to the line joining the two dislocations making an angle of $45^{\\circ}$ with the glide planes. The problem asks for \"the stable equilibrium horizontal separation $x^{\\ast}$\". Since separation is a measure of distance, it is a non-negative quantity. Both stable positions $x^{\\ast}=s$ and $x^{\\ast}=-s$ correspond to the same physical separation distance of $s$. By convention, we report the positive value.\n\nThe condition for the formation of a static dipole is the existence of stable equilibrium points under zero external stress, which we have found.
