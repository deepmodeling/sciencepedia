This first exercise [@problem_id:2815189] provides a foundational practice in the crystallography of cross-slip, requiring you to apply geometric principles to determine the specific pathways available to a screw dislocation. By identifying the valid cross-slip planes within a face-centered cubic lattice, you will gain a concrete understanding of why non-planar slip is a selective, not arbitrary, process.", "problem": "A perfect screw dislocation in a face-centered cubic (fcc) crystal has Burgers vector $\\mathbf{b} = \\frac{a}{2}[1,-1,0]$ and an initial glide plane $(111)$. Using first principles of crystallography and dislocation theory, reason from the following bases:\n\n- In an fcc crystal, the close-packed slip planes are the $\\{111\\}$ family and the close-packed slip directions are the $\\langle 110 \\rangle$ family.\n- A direction $[u,v,w]$ lies in a plane $(h,k,l)$ if and only if $hu + kv + lw = 0$ in a cubic lattice.\n- A screw dislocation has local line direction $\\mathbf{t}$ parallel to $\\mathbf{b}$, and cross-slip of a screw segment can occur only onto a plane that contains the same slip direction (hence the same $\\mathbf{b}$), because the dislocation core can spread into either of the planes that contain that direction.\n\nDetermine all $\\{111\\}$ planes that contain the slip direction $[1,-1,0]$, thereby identifying the distinct cross-slip plane(s) accessible from $(111)$ for this screw segment. Then, construct the unique proper rotation in real space that preserves $\\mathbf{b}$ (i.e., a rotation about the axis $\\hat{\\mathbf{b}} = \\mathbf{b}/|\\mathbf{b}|$) and maps the unit normal of the initial plane $(111)$ to the unit normal of the identified cross-slip plane. Let the rotation angle magnitude be $\\theta \\in [0,\\pi]$, so that only the minimal nonnegative rotation magnitude is reported. Give $\\theta$ as a closed-form analytical expression in radians. Do not approximate numerically. The final reported answer must be only the single quantity $\\theta$.", "solution": "The problem statement is first subjected to validation.\n\nStep 1: Extracted Givens.\n- Crystal structure: face-centered cubic ($fcc$)\n- Dislocation type: perfect screw\n- Burgers vector: $\\mathbf{b} = \\frac{a}{2}[1,-1,0]$\n- Initial glide plane: $(111)$\n- Stipulated slip systems: planes of the $\\{111\\}$ family and directions of the $\\langle 110 \\rangle$ family.\n- Geometric condition for a direction $[u,v,w]$ to lie in a plane $(h,k,l)$: $hu + kv + lw = 0$.\n- Screw dislocation property: dislocation line direction $\\mathbf{t}$ is parallel to its Burgers vector $\\mathbf{b}$.\n- Cross-slip condition: the cross-slip plane must contain the direction of the Burgers vector.\n- Required transformation: a proper rotation that preserves $\\mathbf{b}$ (i.e., rotation about the axis parallel to $\\mathbf{b}$) and maps the unit normal of the initial plane $(111)$ to the unit normal of the cross-slip plane.\n- Constraint on rotation angle: the magnitude $\\theta$ must be in the range $[0, \\pi]$.\n\nStep 2: Validation of Problem Statement.\nThe problem is a well-defined exercise in crystallographic analysis of dislocation behavior, a core topic in materials physics. It is scientifically grounded in established dislocation theory and the geometry of cubic crystals. All premises are factually correct, and the terminology is precise and objective. The problem provides a complete set of conditions required to determine a unique solution. It does not suffer from any listed invalidity flaws such as scientific unsoundness, ambiguity, or missing information.\n\nStep 3: Verdict and Action.\nThe problem is valid. A rigorous solution will be developed.\n\nThe solution proceeds in two stages: first, identification of the cross-slip plane, and second, determination of the required rotation angle.\n\nThe Burgers vector for the screw dislocation is $\\mathbf{b} = \\frac{a}{2}[1,-1,0]$. The slip direction is parallel to the vector component of $\\mathbf{b}$, which is $\\mathbf{d} = [1,-1,0]$. According to the problem statement, a screw dislocation can cross-slip from its initial glide plane to another plane only if that new plane also contains the slip direction, which is defined by $\\mathbf{b}$. The available slip planes are those belonging to the $\\{111\\}$ family.\n\nWe must identify which planes of the $\\{111\\}$ family contain the direction $\\mathbf{d} = [1,-1,0]$. A direction with components $[u,v,w]$ lies within a plane with Miller indices $(h,k,l)$ if the dot product of the direction vector and the plane normal vector is zero. For a cubic system, the normal to the plane $(h,k,l)$ is the vector $[h,k,l]$. The condition is thus $hu + kv + lw = 0$.\nSubstituting the components of our direction, $[u,v,w] = [1,-1,0]$, we obtain the condition for a plane $(h,k,l)$:\n$$h(1) + k(-1) + l(0) = 0$$\n$$h - k = 0 \\implies h = k$$\nWe seek planes from the $\\{111\\}$ family whose Miller indices satisfy this condition. The planes in the $\\{111\\}$ family are those with normals whose components are permutations of $\\{\\pm 1, \\pm 1, \\pm 1\\}$. The condition $h=k$ restricts our search to planes of the form $(h,h,l)$.\nThe distinct planes (noting that $(h,k,l)$ and $(\\bar{h},\\bar{k},\\bar{l})$ are parallel and thus represent the same geometric plane) satisfying this are:\n1. $(111)$\n2. $(11\\bar{1})$\nThe initial glide plane is given as $(111)$, which is consistent with our analysis. Therefore, the only other plane in the $\\{111\\}$ family onto which this screw dislocation can cross-slip is the $(11\\bar{1})$ plane.\n\nNext, we must determine the angle $\\theta$ of the rotation that maps the normal of the initial plane to the normal of the cross-slip plane, with the rotation axis being parallel to the Burgers vector direction $\\mathbf{d}$.\n\nThe rotation axis is along the unit vector $\\hat{\\mathbf{d}}$:\n$$\\hat{\\mathbf{d}} = \\frac{[1,-1,0]}{\\sqrt{1^2 + (-1)^2 + 0^2}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}[1,-1,0]$$\nThe normal to the initial plane, $P_1 = (111)$, is $\\mathbf{n}_1 = [1,1,1]$. The corresponding unit normal vector is:\n$$\\hat{\\mathbf{n}}_1 = \\frac{[1,1,1]}{\\sqrt{1^2 + 1^2 + 1^2}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}}[1,1,1]$$\nThe normal to the cross-slip plane, $P_2 = (11\\bar{1})$, is $\\mathbf{n}_2 = [1,1,-1]$. The corresponding unit normal vector is:\n$$\\hat{\\mathbf{n}}_2 = \\frac{[1,1,-1]}{\\sqrt{1^2 + 1^2 + (-1)^2}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}}[1,1,-1]$$\nThe rotation is performed about the axis $\\hat{\\mathbf{d}}$. The angle of this rotation, $\\theta$, is the angle between the projections of $\\hat{\\mathbf{n}}_1$ and $\\hat{\\mathbf{n}}_2$ onto the plane perpendicular to the rotation axis $\\hat{\\mathbf{d}}$.\nHowever, as established earlier, the slip direction $\\mathbf{d}$ lies within both slip planes. This implies that the direction vector $\\mathbf{d}$ is orthogonal to both plane normals, $\\mathbf{n}_1$ and $\\mathbf{n}_2$. We can verify this:\n$$\\mathbf{n}_1 \\cdot \\mathbf{d} = [1,1,1] \\cdot [1,-1,0] = 1 - 1 + 0 = 0$$\n$$\\mathbf{n}_2 \\cdot \\mathbf{d} = [1,1,-1] \\cdot [1,-1,0] = 1 - 1 + 0 = 0$$\nSince both normal vectors are orthogonal to the rotation axis, they lie entirely within the plane of rotation. Therefore, the angle of rotation $\\theta$ required to map $\\hat{\\mathbf{n}}_1$ to $\\hat{\\mathbf{n}}_2$ is simply the angle between the two unit vectors themselves. This angle is determined from their dot product:\n$$\\cos(\\theta) = \\hat{\\mathbf{n}}_1 \\cdot \\hat{\\mathbf{n}}_2$$\n$$\\cos(\\theta) = \\left(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}}[1,1,1]\\right) \\cdot \\left(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}}[1,1,-1]\\right) = \\frac{1}{3} \\left( (1)(1) + (1)(1) + (1)(-1) \\right)$$\n$$\\cos(\\theta) = \\frac{1}{3}(1+1-1) = \\frac{1}{3}$$\nThe problem asks for the angle $\\theta$ in the range $[0,\\pi]$. This is found by taking the inverse cosine:\n$$\\theta = \\arccos\\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right)$$\nThis is the exact, closed-form analytical expression for the required rotation angle magnitude.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\arccos\\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right)}$$", "id": "2815189"}, {"introduction": "With the geometric rules established, we now turn to the forces that drive dislocation motion.

A complete solution will now be derived.\n\nThe cross-slipped dislocation embryo on the cross plane is a line segment of initial length $L$ pinned at its endpoints. Under the influence of the resolved shear stress $\\tau$, this segment will attempt to bow out. This outward motion is driven by the Peach-Koehler force and opposed by the line tension of the dislocation.\n\nThe Peach-Koehler force, $f_{PK}$, is the force exerted per unit length on a dislocation line by a stress field. For a shear stress $\\tau$ acting on the slip plane containing a dislocation with Burgers vector of magnitude $b$, the force per unit length is directed normal to the dislocation line within the slip plane and has a magnitude:\n$$f_{PK} = \\tau b$$\nThis force acts to expand the bowed-out segment.\n\nThe line tension, $\\Gamma$, is an effective energy per unit length of the dislocation. When the line is curved, the line tension creates a restoring force per unit length, $f_{\\Gamma}$, analogous to the pressure difference across a curved interface due to surface tension. This force is directed towards the center of curvature and is given by:\n$$f_{\\Gamma} = \\frac{\\Gamma}{\\rho}$$\nwhere $\\rho$ is the local radius of curvature of the dislocation line.\n\nFor the bowed segment to be in a state of mechanical equilibrium, these two forces must balance at every point along its length:\n$$f_{PK} = f_{\\Gamma}$$\n$$\\tau b = \\frac{\\Gamma}{\\rho}$$\nSince $\\tau$, $b$, and $\\Gamma$ are all constants, this equilibrium condition dictates that the radius of curvature $\\rho$ must be constant along the entire segment. A line of constant radius of curvature is an arc of a circle. The equilibrium radius is:\n$$\\rho_{\\text{eq}} = \\frac{\\Gamma}{\\tau b}$$\n\nThe dislocation segment is pinned at two points separated by a distance $L$. As it bows out, it forms a circular arc. The maximum possible extent of this bowing occurs when the segment forms a semicircle, at which point its diameter is the pinning distance $L$. The radius of curvature in this specific configuration, $\\rho_{\\text{sc}}$, is:\n$$\\rho_{\\text{sc}} = \\frac{L}{2}$$\nThis semicircular configuration represents the state of maximum curvature and thus the state of maximum restoring force from line tension for a given pinning distance $L$. The maximum restoring force per unit length is:\n$$f_{\\Gamma, \\max} = \\frac{\\Gamma}{\\rho_{\\text{sc}}} = \\frac{\\Gamma}{L/2} = \\frac{2\\Gamma}{L}$$\n\nThe problem asks for the condition under which the embryo becomes \"self-sustaining and expands.\" This describes the transition from a stable bow-out to an unstable, continuous expansion, which is characteristic of a Frank-Read source. This unstable expansion occurs if the driving force from the applied stress is greater than or equal to the maximum possible restoring force that the line tension can exert. The critical condition is met when the driving force just balances this maximum restoring force:\n$$f_{PK} \\ge f_{\\Gamma, \\max}$$\n$$\\tau b \\ge \\frac{2\\Gamma}{L}$$\nThis inequality defines the condition for the activation of the cross-slipped segment as a dislocation source on the cross plane. For a given stress $\\tau$, the source will operate if the pinning length $L$ is sufficiently large. To find the minimum required length, we rearrange the inequality to solve for $L$:\n$$L \\ge \\frac{2\\Gamma}{\\tau b}$$\nTherefore, the minimum constricted length, $L_{\\min}$, required for the embryo to be self-sustaining is the length at which this equality is met:\n$$L_{\\min} = \\frac{2\\Gamma}{\\tau b}$$\n\nNow, we evaluate this expression numerically using the provided values.
