It is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and requires the application of fundamental definitions to derive a relationship and perform a calculation. The data provided are consistent and sufficient for the tasks.\n\nThe solution is partitioned into two tasks as specified.\n\n**Task 1: Derivation of the Charge Transition Level Shift**\n\nThe formation energy of a defect $X$ in charge state $q$ is a function of the Fermi level $E_{F}$, given by the general expression:\n$$E_{f}(X^q; E_{F}) = E_{\\text{tot}}(X^q) - \\sum_{i} n_{i} \\mu_{i} + q E_{F}$$\nwhere $E_{\\text{tot}}(X^q)$ is the total energy of the supercell containing the defect, $\\sum_{i} n_{i} \\mu_{i}$ represents the sum of chemical potentials of constituent atoms, and $E_F$ is the Fermi level referenced to the VBM. We can write this as a linear function of $E_{F}$:\n$$E_{f}(X^q; E_{F}) = E_{f}(X^q; E_{F}=0) + qE_{F}$$\nwhere $E_{f}(X^q; E_{F}=0)$ is the formation energy at the VBM.\n\nThe charge transition level $\\varepsilon(q_1/q_2)$ is defined as the Fermi level at which the formation energies of the two charge states are equal:\n$$E_{f}(X^{q_1}; E_{F}=\\varepsilon) = E_{f}(X^{q_2}; E_{F}=\\varepsilon)$$\n$$E_{f}(X^{q_1}; 0) + q_1 \\varepsilon = E_{f}(X^{q_2}; 0) + q_2 \\varepsilon$$\nSolving for $\\varepsilon$ gives:\n$$\\varepsilon(q_1/q_2) = \\frac{E_{f}(X^{q_1}; 0) - E_{f}(X^{q_2}; 0)}{q_2 - q_1}$$\nFor the isolated phosphorus donor, $D = P_{\\mathrm{Si}}$, the donor transition is from charge state $q_2=0$ to $q_1=+1$. The corresponding transition level, $\\varepsilon_{D}$, is:\n$$\\varepsilon_{D} \\equiv \\varepsilon(D^{+1}/D^0) = \\frac{E_{f}(D^{+1}; 0) - E_{f}(D^0; 0)}{0 - 1} = E_{f}(D^0; 0) - E_{f}(D^{+1}; 0)$$\n\nNext, we consider the complex, $C = (P_{\\mathrm{Si}}-V_{\\mathrm{Si}})$.\n**Assumption:** The \"donor-like\" transition on the complex corresponds to the phosphorus atom transitioning from $P_{\\mathrm{Si}}^{+1}$ to $P_{\\mathrm{Si}}^0$, while the silicon vacancy, $V_{\\mathrm{Si}}$, acts as a spectator, remaining in a fixed charge state $q_V$.\nUnder this assumption, the complex transitions from an initial charge state $Q_2 = (0) + q_V = q_V$ to a final charge state $Q_1 = (+1) + q_V$. The transition level for the complex, $\\varepsilon_{C}$, is then:\n$$\\varepsilon_{C} \\equiv \\varepsilon(C^{1+q_V}/C^{q_V}) = E_{f}(C^{q_V}; 0) - E_{f}(C^{1+q_V}; 0)$$\n\nThe shift, $\\Delta \\varepsilon$, is the difference between the complex's level and the isolated donor's level:\n$$\\Delta \\varepsilon = \\varepsilon_{C} - \\varepsilon_{D}$$\n\nTo express this in terms of binding energies, we use the provided definition for the binding energy, $E_b(Q)$, of a complex in total charge state $Q$. Since the binding energy resulting from Coulombic and short-range interactions is independent of the Fermi level, we can write:\n$$E_{b}(Q) = \\left[ E_{f}(D^{q_D}; 0) + E_{f}(V^{q_V}; 0) \\right] - E_{f}(C^Q; 0)$$\nwhere the charges of the isolated constituents, $q_D$ and $q_V$, must sum to the total charge of the complex, $Q = q_D + q_V$. We rearrange this to express the complex formation energy:\n$$E_{f}(C^Q; 0) = E_{f}(D^{q_D}; 0) + E_{f}(V^{q_V}; 0) - E_b(Q)$$\n\nWe apply this to the two relevant charge states of the complex:\nFor $Q_1 = 1+q_V$, the constituents are $D^{+1}$ and $V^{q_V}$.\n$$E_{f}(C^{1+q_V}; 0) = E_{f}(D^{+1}; 0) + E_{f}(V^{q_V}; 0) - E_b(1+q_V)$$\nFor $Q_2 = q_V$, the constituents are $D^0$ and $V^{q_V}$.\n$$E_{f}(C^{q_V}; 0) = E_{f}(D^0; 0) + E_{f}(V^{q_V}; 0) - E_b(q_V)$$\n\nNow, substitute these expressions back into the formula for $\\varepsilon_C$:\n$$\\varepsilon_{C} = \\left[ E_{f}(D^0; 0) + E_{f}(V^{q_V}; 0) - E_b(q_V) \\right] - \\left[ E_{f}(D^{+1}; 0) + E_{f}(V^{q_V}; 0) - E_b(1+q_V) \\right]$$\nThe term $E_{f}(V^{q_V}; 0)$ cancels, and we can group the remaining terms:\n$$\\varepsilon_{C} = \\left[ E_{f}(D^0; 0) - E_{f}(D^{+1}; 0) \\right] - E_b(q_V) + E_b(1+q_V)$$\nRecognizing that the term in brackets is the definition of $\\varepsilon_D$:\n$$\\varepsilon_{C} = \\varepsilon_{D} + E_b(1+q_V) - E_b(q_V)$$\nThe shift $\\Delta \\varepsilon = \\varepsilon_{C} - \\varepsilon_{D}$ is therefore:\n$$\\Delta \\varepsilon = E_b(1+q_V) - E_b(q_V)$$\nThis expression represents the shift of the donor-like transition level of the complex relative to the isolated donor, expressed in terms of the binding energies of the complex in its final and initial charge states.\n\n**Task 2: Calculation of the Binding Energy of the Neutral Complex**\n\nThe binding energy $E_b(Q)$ of the complex $(P_{\\mathrm{Si}}-V_{\\mathrm{Si}})$ in total charge state $Q$ is given by the difference between the sum of formation energies of its isolated constituents and the formation energy of the complex.\n$$E_{b}(Q) = \\left[ E_{f}(P_{\\mathrm{Si}}^{q_P}) + E_{f}(V_{\\mathrm{Si}}^{q_V}) \\right] - E_{f}((P_{\\mathrm{Si}}-V_{\\mathrm{Si}})^{Q})$$\nwhere $q_P + q_V = Q$.\n\nWe are asked to compute the binding energy of the neutral complex, for which $Q=0$. The problem provides formation energies for $P_{\\mathrm{Si}}^{+1}$ and $V_{\\mathrm{Si}}^{-1}$. The sum of their charges is $(+1) + (-1) = 0$, which matches the total charge of the neutral complex. Therefore, these are the correct constituent charge states to consider.\n\nThe calculation is to be performed using the energies provided at $E_F = 0.56\\,\\mathrm{eV}$:\n- $E_{f}(P_{\\mathrm{Si}}^{+1}; E_{F}=0.56\\,\\mathrm{eV}) = 2.83\\,\\mathrm{eV}$\n- $E_{f}(V_{\\mathrm{Si}}^{-1}; E_{F}=0.56\\,\\mathrm{eV}) = 3.12\\,\\mathrm{eV}$\n- $E_{f}((P_{\\mathrm{Si}}-V_{\\mathrm{Si}})^{0}; E_{F}=0.56\\,\\mathrm{eV}) = 5.50\\,\\mathrm{eV}$\n\nUsing the binding energy formula for $Q=0$:\n$$E_{b}(0) = \\left[ E_{f}(P_{\\mathrm{Si}}^{+1}; E_F) + E_{f}(V_{\\mathrm{Si}}^{-1}; E_F) \\right] - E_{f}((P_{\\mathrm{Si}}-V_{\\mathrm{Si}})^{0}; E_F)$$\nSubstitute the provided numerical values:\n$$E_{b}(0) = (2.83\\,\\mathrm{eV} + 3.12\\,\\mathrm{eV}) - 5.50\\,\\mathrm{eV}$$\n$$E_{b}(0) = 5.95\\,\\mathrm{eV} - 5.50\\,\\mathrm{eV}$$\n$$E_{b}(0) = 0.45\\,\\mathrm{eV}$$\n\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures.

The mobility $\\mu$ is given by $\\mu = e \\langle \\tau \\rangle / m^{\\ast}$, where $\\langle \\tau \\rangle$ is the appropriately averaged relaxation time. The mobility's temperature dependence is dominated by that of $\\langle \\tau \\rangle$. According to the Boltzmann transport theory for a nondegenerate gas with a parabolic band structure, the conductivity $\\sigma$ is given by:\n$$ \\sigma = -\\frac{2 e^2}{3m^*} \\int_0^\\infty \\varepsilon \\tau(\\varepsilon) g(\\varepsilon) \\frac{\\partial f_0}{\\partial \\varepsilon} d\\varepsilon $$\nHere, $\\tau(\\varepsilon)$ is the energy-dependent relaxation time, $g(\\varepsilon)$ is the density of states, and $f_0(\\varepsilon)$ is the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution function. For a three-dimensional system with a single parabolic band, $g(\\varepsilon) \\propto \\varepsilon^{1/2}$. The normalized distribution function is $f_0(\\varepsilon) = \\frac{n}{N_c(T)} \\exp(-\\varepsilon/k_B T)$, where $n$ is the constant carrier concentration and $N_c(T) \\propto T^{3/2}$ is the effective density of states in the conduction band.

For a parabolic band, $v(\\varepsilon) = \\sqrt{2\\varepsilon/m^*} \\propto \\varepsilon^{1/2}$. For scattering from a screened Coulomb potential, the transport cross-section $\\sigma_{\\mathrm{tr,ii}}$ has a leading dependence of $\\varepsilon^{-2}$. The problem states that any logarithmic correction factor can be treated as constant. Therefore,\n    $$ \\frac{1}{\\tau_{\\mathrm{ii}}(\\varepsilon)} \\propto v(\\varepsilon)\\sigma_{\\mathrm{tr,ii}}(\\varepsilon) \\propto \\varepsilon^{1/2} \\varepsilon^{-2} = \\varepsilon^{-3/2} $$\n    This gives the energy dependence of the relaxation time as $\\tau_{\\mathrm{ii}}(\\varepsilon) = A \\varepsilon^{3/2}$, where $A$ is a constant. We substitute this into our integral for mobility:\n    $$ \\mu_{\\mathrm{ii}}(T) \\propto T^{-5/2} \\int_0^\\infty \\varepsilon^{3/2} (A \\varepsilon^{3/2}) \\exp(-\\varepsilon/k_B T) d\\varepsilon = A T^{-5/2} \\int_0^\\infty \\varepsilon^3 \\exp(-\\varepsilon/k_B T) d\\varepsilon $$\n    Performing the substitution $x = \\varepsilon/(k_B T)$, the integral becomes $(k_B T)^4 \\int_0^\\infty x^3 e^{-x} dx = (k_B T)^4 \\Gamma(4)$. The integral's temperature dependence is $T^4$.\n    Thus, the temperature dependence of the mobility is:\n    $$ \\mu_{\\mathrm{ii}}(T) \\propto T^{3/2} $$\n\n2.  **Acoustic-Phonon-Limited Mobility ($\\mu_{\\mathrm{ac}}$)**\n    For deformation-potential scattering by acoustic phonons in the equipartition regime ($k_B T \\gg \\hbar\\omega_{\\mathrm{phonon}}$), the scattering rate is proportional to the density of final electronic states and the number of available phonons. The number of phonons is proportional to the absolute temperature $T$. The density of final states is proportional to $\\varepsilon^{1/2}$. The matrix element is constant for this mechanism. Therefore:\n    $$ \\frac{1}{\\tau_{\\mathrm{ac}}(\\varepsilon)} \\propto T \\cdot \\varepsilon^{1/2} $$\n    This gives $\\tau_{\\mathrm{ac}}(\\varepsilon, T) = B T^{-1} \\varepsilon^{-1/2}$, where $B$ is a constant.

We seek to compute $n_{\\mathrm{eff}}(T) = \\frac{d \\ln \\mu_{\\mathrm{tot}}}{d \\ln T}$.\nTaking the natural logarithm of the expression for $\\mu_{\\mathrm{tot}}$ is not direct. Instead, we differentiate the reciprocal sum with respect to $\\ln T$:\n$$ \\frac{d}{d \\ln T} \\left(\\frac{1}{\\mu_{\\mathrm{tot}}}\\right) = \\frac{d}{d \\ln T} \\left(\\frac{1}{\\mu_{\\mathrm{ii}}}\\right) + \\frac{d}{d \\ln T} \\left(\\frac{1}{\\mu_{\\mathrm{ac}}}\\right) $$\nUsing the chain rule, for any mobility $\\mu(T)$, $\\frac{d(\\mu^{-1})}{d\\ln T} = -\\mu^{-2} \\frac{d\\mu}{d\\ln T}$.

Second, we calculate the hydrogenic ground-state energy and combine it with the lowest valley-orbit eigenvalue to find the total ground-state energy.\n\n**Part a) Eigenvalues of the Valley-Orbit Coupling Matrix**\n\nThe central-cell Hamiltonian, $H_{vo}$, describes the coupling between the six equivalent conduction-band valleys. We are given the basis states corresponding to the valleys along the $\\pm k_{x}$, $\\pm k_{y}$, and $\\pm k_{z}$ directions, which we denote as $\\{|+\\!x\\rangle, |-\\!x\\rangle, |+\\!y\\rangle, |-\\!y\\rangle, |+\\!z\\rangle, |-\\!z\\rangle\\}$. The Hamiltonian matrix in this basis is constructed according to the provided rules:\n$1.$ An intravalley energy shift $v_{0}$ for each valley, which corresponds to the diagonal elements.\n$2.$ A coupling $v_{1}$ between opposite valleys on the same crystallographic axis (e.g., between $|+\\!x\\rangle$ and $|-\\!x\\rangle$).\n$3.$ A coupling $v_{2}$ between any two valleys on perpendicular axes (e.g., between $|+\\!x\\rangle$ and $|\\pm y\\rangle$).\n\nThe resulting $6 \\times 6$ Hermitian matrix is:\n$$\nH_{vo} =\n\\begin{pmatrix}\nv_{0} & v_{1} & v_{2} & v_{2} & v_{2} & v_{2} \\\\\nv_{1} & v_{0} & v_{2} & v_{2} & v_{2} & v_{2} \\\\\nv_{2} & v_{2} & v_{0} & v_{1} & v_{2} & v_{2} \\\\\nv_{2} & v_{2} & v_{1} & v_{0} & v_{2} & v_{2} \\\\\nv_{2} & v_{2} & v_{2} & v_{2} & v_{0} & v_{1} \\\\\nv_{2} & v_{2} & v_{2} & v_{2} & v_{1} & v_{0}\n\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\n\nTo find the eigenvalues, we construct symmetry-adapted linear combinations (SALCs) of the valley basis states that transform according to the irreducible representations of the tetrahedral point group ($T_{d}$), which are $A_{1}$ (nondegenerate), $E$ (doubly degenerate), and $T_{2}$ (triply degenerate).\n\nFor the $T_{2}$ representation, the basis functions are odd with respect to reflection in a plane bisecting the crystallographic axes (e.g., $k_x \\to -k_x$). An example of such a state is $|\\psi_{T_2,x}\\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(|+\\!x\\rangle - |-\\!x\\rangle)$. Let us operate on this state with $H_{vo}$:\n$$\nH_{vo} (|+\\!x\\rangle - |-\\!x\\rangle) = (v_{0} |+\\!x\\rangle + v_{1} |-\\!x\\rangle + v_{2}\\sum_{j \\neq x} |\\psi_j\\rangle) - (v_{1} |+\\!x\\rangle + v_{0} |-\\!x\\rangle + v_{2}\\sum_{j \\neq x} |\\psi_j\\rangle)\n$$\nThe sums over perpendicular valleys, $\\sum_{j \\neq x} |\\psi_j\\rangle$, are identical and cancel. This leaves:\n$$\nH_{vo} (|+\\!x\\rangle - |-\\!x\\rangle) = (v_{0} - v_{1}) |+\\!x\\rangle - (v_{0} - v_{1}) |-\\!x\\rangle = (v_{0} - v_{1}) (|+\\!x\\rangle - |-\\!x\\rangle)\n$$\nThe eigenvalue for the $T_{2}$ states is thus $E_{T_2} = v_{0} - v_{1}$. This eigenvalue is triply degenerate, corresponding to similar states constructed from the $y$ and $z$ valleys.\n\nFor the remaining states, which are even, we can form combinations like $|\\phi_x\\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(|+\\!x\\rangle + |-\\!x\\rangle)$. Operating with $H_{vo}$ on this state gives:\n$$\nH_{vo} |\\phi_x\\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} H_{vo} (|+\\!x\\rangle + |-\\!x\\rangle) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} [(v_{0}+v_{1})(|+\\!x\\rangle + |-\\!x\\rangle) + 2v_{2}(|+\\!y\\rangle + |-\\!y\\rangle + |+\\!z\\rangle + |-\\!z\\rangle)]\n$$\n$$\nH_{vo} |\\phi_x\\rangle = (v_{0}+v_{1})|\\phi_x\\rangle + 2\\sqrt{2}v_{2}(|\\phi_y\\rangle + |\\phi_z\\rangle)\n$$\nBy symmetry, we have a $3 \\times 3$ matrix problem for the $\\{|\\phi_x\\rangle, |\\phi_y\\rangle, |\\phi_z\\rangle\\}$ basis:\n$$\nH'_{vo} = \n\\begin{pmatrix}\nv_{0}+v_{1} & 2v_{2} & 2v_{2} \\\\\n2v_{2} & v_{0}+v_{1} & 2v_{2} \\\\\n2v_{2} & 2v_{2} & v_{0}+v_{1}\n\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe fully symmetric $A_{1}$ state is $|\\psi_{A_1}\\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}}(|\\phi_x\\rangle + |\\phi_y\\rangle + |\\phi_z\\rangle)$. The corresponding eigenvalue is the sum of the elements in any row:\n$$\nE_{A_1} = (v_{0}+v_{1}) + 2v_{2} + 2v_{2} = v_{0} + v_{1} + 4v_{2}\n$$\nThe other two eigenvalues of this $3 \\times 3$ matrix correspond to the doubly degenerate $E$ representation. We can find them by considering a state orthogonal to the $A_1$ state, for instance $|\\psi_{E}\\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(|\\phi_x\\rangle - |\\phi_y\\rangle)$.\n$$\nH'_{vo} |\\psi_{E}\\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}[(v_{0}+v_{1})|\\phi_x\\rangle + 2v_{2}(|\\phi_y\\rangle+|\\phi_z\\rangle)] - \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}[2v_{2}(|\\phi_x\\rangle+|\\phi_z\\rangle) + (v_{0}+v_{1})|\\phi_y\\rangle]\n$$\n$$\n= \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}[(v_{0}+v_{1}-2v_{2})|\\phi_x\\rangle - (v_{0}+v_{1}-2v_{2})|\\phi_y\\rangle] = (v_{0}+v_{1}-2v_{2})|\\psi_{E}\\rangle\n$$\nThe eigenvalue for the $E$ states is thus $E_{E} = v_{0} + v_{1} - 2v_{2}$.\n\nIn summary, the three distinct symbolic eigenvalues are:\n$E_{A_1} = v_{0} + v_{1} + 4v_{2}$\n$E_{E} = v_{0} + v_{1} - 2v_{2}$\n$E_{T_2} = v_{0} - v_{1}$\n\n**Part b) Total Ground-State Energy**\n\nThe total energy of a donor state is the sum of the hydrogenic binding energy, $E_{1s,H}$, and the valley-orbit energy correction. The ground state corresponds to the lowest total energy. First, we compute the numerical values for the valley-orbit eigenvalues using $v_{0}=-1.2\\,\\mathrm{meV}$, $v_{1}=-1.8\\,\\mathrm{meV}$, and $v_{2}=-1.5\\,\\mathrm{meV}$:\n$E_{A_1} = -1.2 + (-1.8) + 4(-1.5) = -1.2 - 1.8 - 6.0 = -9.0\\,\\mathrm{meV}$\n$E_{E} = -1.2 + (-1.8) - 2(-1.5) = -1.2 - 1.8 + 3.0 = 0.0\\,\\mathrm{meV}$\n$E_{T_2} = -1.2 - (-1.8) = -1.2 + 1.8 = 0.6\\,\\mathrm{meV}$\nThe lowest energy level due to valley-orbit interaction is the nondegenerate $A_{1}$ state, $E_{A_1} = -9.0\\,\\mathrm{meV}$.\n\nNext, we calculate the hydrogenic binding energy, $E_{1s,H}$. The binding energy for a hydrogenic system scales with the effective mass $m^{\\ast}$ and the square of the dielectric constant $\\varepsilon_{r}$. Using the provided vacuum ground-state energy of hydrogen, $E_{H} = -13.605693\\,\\mathrm{eV}$:\n$$\nE_{1s,H} = E_{H} \\frac{m^{\\ast}/m_{0}}{(\\varepsilon_{r})^{2}}\n$$\nWe first calculate the isotropized effective mass ratio $m^{\\ast}/m_{0}$:\n$$\n\\frac{m^{\\ast}}{m_{0}} = \\left( \\left(\\frac{m_{l}}{m_{0}}\\right) \\left(\\frac{m_{t}}{m_{0}}\\right)^{2} \\right)^{1/3} = \\left( (0.916)(0.190)^{2} \\right)^{1/3} = (0.916 \\times 0.0361)^{1/3} = (0.0330676)^{1/3} \\approx 0.320984\n$$\nNow, we compute $E_{1s,H}$ using $\\varepsilon_{r} = 11.7$:\n$$\nE_{1s,H} = (-13.605693\\,\\mathrm{eV}) \\frac{0.320984}{(11.7)^{2}} = (-13.605693\\,\\mathrm{eV}) \\frac{0.320984}{136.89} \\approx -0.031902\\,\\mathrm{eV}\n$$\nConverting to millielectronvolts ($1\\,\\mathrm{eV} = 1000\\,\\mathrm{meV}$):\n$$\nE_{1s,H} \\approx -31.902\\,\\mathrm{meV}\n$$\nThe total ground-state energy, $E_{GS}$, is the sum of the hydrogenic energy and the energy of the $A_1$ valley-orbit state:\n$$\nE_{GS} = E_{1s,H} + E_{A_1} = -31.902\\,\\mathrm{meV} + (-9.0\\,\\mathrm{meV}) = -40.902\\,\\mathrm{meV}\n$$\nRounding to three significant figures as requested, we obtain the final answer for the ground-state energy.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{-40.9}\n$$", "id": "2815859"}]}
