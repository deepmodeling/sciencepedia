It represents a standard exercise in semiconductor physics. We will now proceed with the derivation from first principles as requested.\n\nThe concentration of electrons, $n$, in the conduction band and the concentration of holes, $p$, in the valence band are given in the nondegenerate (Maxwell-Boltzmann) limit by the following fundamental expressions:\n$$n = N_C \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_C - E_F}{k_B T}\\right)$$\n$$p = N_V \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_F - E_V}{k_B T}\\right)$$\nHere, $N_C$ and $N_V$ are the effective densities of states in the conduction and valence bands, respectively, $E_C$ and $E_V$ are the energies of the band edges, $E_F$ is the Fermi level, $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant, and $T$ is the absolute temperature.\n\nFirst, we derive the equilibrium relation between $n$ and $p$. This is achieved by computing the product $np$:\n$$np = \\left(N_C \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_C - E_F}{k_B T}\\right)\\right) \\left(N_V \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_F - E_V}{k_B T}\\right)\\right)$$\n$$np = N_C N_V \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_C - E_F + E_F - E_V}{k_B T}\\right)$$\nThe Fermi level $E_F$ cancels in the exponent, leading to:\n$$np = N_C N_V \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_C - E_V}{k_B T}\\right)$$\nThe energy difference $E_g = E_C - E_V$ is the semiconductor bandgap energy. Therefore, the product becomes:\n$$np = N_C N_V \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_g}{k_B T}\\right)$$\nAt a fixed temperature $T$, the right side of this equation is a constant, as $N_C$, $N_V$, and $E_g$ are material parameters that depend on temperature but not on doping or the Fermi level. This constant is defined as the square of the intrinsic carrier concentration, $n_i^2$. The intrinsic concentration $n_i$ is the concentration of electrons (or holes) in an undoped (intrinsic) semiconductor, where $n = p = n_i$. Thus, we have established the law of mass action for semiconductors:\n$$np = n_i^2$$\nThis is the first required relation.\n\nSecond, we formulate the condition of global charge neutrality. The semiconductor is electrically neutral in its entirety. The total density of positive charge must equal the total density of negative charge. The sources of positive charge are holes (concentration $p$) and ionized donor atoms (concentration $N_D^+$). The sources of negative charge are electrons (concentration $n$) and ionized acceptor atoms (concentration $N_A^-$). The neutrality condition is therefore:\n$$p + N_D^+ = n + N_A^-$$\nThe problem specifies the assumption of complete ionization for the shallow dopants. This implies that every donor atom has lost its electron, and every acceptor atom has gained an electron. Mathematically, this means:\n$$N_D^+ = N_D$$\n$$N_A^- = N_A$$\nwhere $N_D$ and $N_A$ are the total concentrations of donor and acceptor atoms, respectively. Substituting these into the neutrality equation yields the second required relation for a compensated semiconductor with full ionization:\n$$p + N_D = n + N_A$$\n\nThird, we must solve this system of two equations for the two unknowns, $n$ and $p$:\n1. $np = n_i^2$\n2. $p + N_D = n + N_A$\n\nWe can express $p$ from the first equation as $p = \\frac{n_i^2}{n}$ and substitute it into the second equation:\n$$\\frac{n_i^2}{n} + N_D = n + N_A$$\nTo eliminate the fraction, we multiply the entire equation by $n$ (noting that $n \\neq 0$):\n$$n_i^2 + nN_D = n^2 + nN_A$$\nRearranging this into a standard quadratic form, $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$, with $x=n$, gives:\n$$n^2 + n(N_A - N_D) - n_i^2 = 0$$\nThis is a quadratic equation for the electron concentration $n$. We solve it using the quadratic formula, $n = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$, where $a=1$, $b = N_A - N_D$, and $c = -n_i^2$:\n$$n = \\frac{-(N_A - N_D) \\pm \\sqrt{(N_A - N_D)^2 - 4(1)(-n_i^2)}}{2}$$\n$$n = \\frac{N_D - N_A \\pm \\sqrt{(N_D - N_A)^2 + 4n_i^2}}{2}$$\nSince the electron concentration $n$ is a physical quantity, it must be positive. The term under the square root, $\\sqrt{(N_D - N_A)^2 + 4n_i^2}$, is strictly greater than $|N_D - N_A|$. If we choose the negative sign, the numerator $(N_D - N_A) - \\sqrt{(N_D - N_A)^2 + 4n_i^2}$ would be negative, yielding an unphysical negative concentration. Therefore, we must select the positive root:\n$$n = \\frac{N_D - N_A + \\sqrt{(N_D - N_A)^2 + 4n_i^2}}{2}$$\nThis can be written more elegantly as:\n$$n = \\frac{N_D - N_A}{2} + \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{N_D - N_A}{2}\\right)^2 + n_i^2}$$\nTo find the hole concentration $p$, we can follow a symmetrical procedure. From the neutrality equation, we express $n = p + N_D - N_A$. Substituting into the mass-action law $np = n_i^2$:\n$$(p + N_D - N_A)p = n_i^2$$\n$$p^2 + p(N_D - N_A) - n_i^2 = 0$$\nSolving this quadratic equation for $p$ yields:\n$$p = \\frac{-(N_D - N_A) \\pm \\sqrt{(N_D - N_A)^2 - 4(1)(-n_i^2)}}{2}$$\n$$p = \\frac{N_A - N_D \\pm \\sqrt{(N_A - N_D)^2 + 4n_i^2}}{2}$$\nAgain, for $p$ to be a physically meaningful positive quantity, we must take the positive root:\n$$p = \\frac{N_A - N_D + \\sqrt{(N_A - N_D)^2 + 4n_i^2}}{2}$$\nThis can be written as:\n$$p = \\frac{N_A - N_D}{2} + \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{N_A - N_D}{2}\\right)^2 + n_i^2}$$\nThese are the exact, closed-form expressions for the electron and hole concentrations under the given assumptions.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n\\frac{N_D - N_A}{2} + \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{N_D - N_A}{2}\\right)^2 + n_i^2} & \\frac{N_A - N_D}{2} + \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{N_A - N_D}{2}\\right)^2 + n_i^2}\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "2836467"}, {"introduction": "The derivation in our first exercise relied on the Maxwell-Boltzmann approximation, which assumes a non-degenerate carrier gas.

We may proceed to the solution.\n\nThe objective is to find upper bounds for the relative error of the Maxwell-Boltzmann (MB) approximation for electron and hole concentrations in a nondegenerate semiconductor.\n\nFirst, consider the electron concentration $n$. It is given by\n$$n = \\int_{E_{c}}^{\\infty} D_{c}(E) f_{FD}(E) dE$$\nwhere $D_c(E) = C_c \\sqrt{E-E_c}$ for $E \\ge E_c$ is the density of states with $C_c = \\frac{(2m_c^*)^{3/2}}{2\\pi^2\\hbar^3}$, and $f_{FD}(E) = [1 + \\exp((E - E_{f})/(k_{B} T))]^{-1}$ is the Fermi-Dirac distribution.\n\nThe Maxwell-Boltzmann approximation is $n_{MB} = \\int_{E_{c}}^{\\infty} D_{c}(E) f_{MB}(E) dE$, where $f_{MB}(E) = \\exp(-(E - E_{f})/(k_{B} T))$.\n\nLet us expand the Fermi-Dirac distribution. Define $x = (E - E_{f})/(k_{B} T)$. For electrons in the conduction band, $E \\ge E_c$. The nondegeneracy condition $\\eta = (E_f - E_c)/(k_B T)  0$ implies $E_f  E_c$. Thus, $E - E_f  E_c - E_f  0$, which ensures $x  0$ and $\\exp(-x)  1$.\nWe can write $f_{FD}(E)$ as:\n$$f_{FD}(E) = \\frac{1}{1 + e^{x}} = \\frac{e^{-x}}{e^{-x} + 1}$$\nUsing the geometric series expansion for $(1+u)^{-1} = \\sum_{j=0}^{\\infty} (-u)^j$ with $u=e^{-x}$, we get:\n$$f_{FD}(E) = e^{-x} \\sum_{j=0}^{\\infty} (-1)^j (e^{-x})^j = \\sum_{j=1}^{\\infty} (-1)^{j-1} e^{-jx}$$\nThe first term ($j=1$) of this series is $e^{-x} = f_{MB}(E)$.

To evaluate $I_j$, we perform a change of variables to $\\epsilon = (E-E_c)/(k_B T)$. Then $E = E_c + \\epsilon k_B T$ and $dE = k_B T d\\epsilon$.

We have:\n$$p = \\int_{-\\infty}^{E_{v}} D_{v}(E) [1 - f_{FD}(E)] dE$$\nwhere $D_v(E) = C_v \\sqrt{E_v - E}$ and $C_v = \\frac{(2m_v^*)^{3/2}}{2\\pi^2\\hbar^3}$.\nThe term $1-f_{FD}(E)$ is the probability of a state at energy $E$ being occupied by a hole:\n$$1 - f_{FD}(E) = 1 - \\frac{1}{1 + e^x} = \\frac{e^x}{1 + e^x} = \\frac{1}{1+e^{-x}}$$\nwhere $x=(E-E_f)/(k_B T)$. For holes in the valence band, $E \\le E_v$. The nondegeneracy condition $\\eta' = (E_v - E_f)/(k_B T)  0$ implies $E_f  E_v$. Thus, $E-E_f  E_v - E_f  0$, which ensures $x  0$ and $e^x  1$.\nThe MB approximation for the hole occupation probability is $\\exp(x) = \\exp((E-E_f)/(k_B T))$. We expand $1-f_{FD}(E)$ in a geometric series using $u=e^x$:\n$$1-f_{FD}(E) = \\frac{e^x}{1+e^x} = e^x \\sum_{j=0}^{\\infty} (-1)^j (e^x)^j = \\sum_{j=1}^{\\infty} (-1)^{j-1} e^{jx}$$\nThe first term ($j=1$) is the MB approximation. By complete analogy with the electron case, we can write $p = \\sum_{j=1}^{\\infty} (-1)^{j-1} J_j$, where $p_{MB} = J_1$. The integral $J_j$ is:\n$$J_j = \\int_{-\\infty}^{E_{v}} D_v(E) \\exp\\left(\\frac{j(E-E_f)}{k_B T}\\right) dE$$\nLet $\\epsilon = (E_v-E)/(k_B T)$.

The exponent becomes:\n$$\\frac{j(E-E_f)}{k_B T} = \\frac{j(E-E_v+E_v-E_f)}{k_B T} = -j\\epsilon + j\\eta'$$\nThe integral for $J_j$ becomes:\n$$J_j = \\int_{\\infty}^{0} C_v (k_B T)^{1/2} \\epsilon^{1/2} \\cdot \\exp(-j\\epsilon+j\\eta') \\cdot (-k_B T d\\epsilon) = C_v(k_B T)^{3/2} e^{j\\eta'} \\int_0^\\infty \\epsilon^{1/2} e^{-j\\epsilon} d\\epsilon$$\nThis integral is identical in form to the one for $I_j$.

It is scientifically grounded in the principles of semiconductor physics, well-posed, and provides a complete and consistent set of data and physical models for a meaningful solution. We shall proceed with the derivation and numerical implementation.\n\nThe objective is to determine the temperature $T_{0.1}$ at which the electron concentration $n$ in a donor-doped semiconductor reaches $90\\%$ of the total donor concentration $N_D$, and then to calculate the corresponding minority carrier (hole) concentration $p$ at this temperature.\n\nFirst, we must establish a self-consistent equation for the electron concentration $n$ as a function of temperature $T$. The problem specifies the charge neutrality condition in the freeze-out regime for an n-type semiconductor with uncompensated donors is to be approximated as:\n$$\nn = N_D^+\n$$\nwhere $N_D^+$ is the concentration of ionized donors. The concentration of holes $p$ is considered negligible for the purpose of establishing charge neutrality at the low temperatures relevant to ionization freeze-out.\n\nThe electron concentration $n$ is given by the nondegenerate statistical mechanics model:\n$$\nn = N_C(T)\\,\\exp\\!\\left(-\\frac{E_C - E_F}{k_B T}\\right)\n\\quad\\quad (1)\n$$\nwhere $N_C(T)$ is the effective density of states in the conduction band, $E_C$ is the conduction band energy minimum, $E_F$ is the Fermi level, $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant, and $T$ is the absolute temperature.\n\nThe concentration of ionized donors, $N_D^+$, is given by the total donor concentration $N_D$ multiplied by the probability that a donor state is empty (ionized). Using the provided Fermi-Dirac statistics for donors with energy level $E_D$ and degeneracy $g_D$:\n$$\nN_D^+ = N_D \\left(1 - f_D\\right) = N_D \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{1 + g_D \\exp\\left(\\frac{E_D - E_F}{k_B T}\\right)}\\right) = N_D \\frac{g_D \\exp\\left(\\frac{E_D - E_F}{k_B T}\\right)}{1 + g_D \\exp\\left(\\frac{E_D - E_F}{k_B T}\\right)}\n\\quad\\quad (2)\n$$\n\nTo find an expression for $n(T)$ that does not depend on the Fermi level $E_F$, we must eliminate $E_F$ from these equations. From equation $(1)$, we can write:\n$$\n\\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_C - E_F}{k_B T}\\right) = \\frac{n}{N_C(T)}\n$$\nThis is equivalent to $\\exp\\left(\\frac{E_F}{k_B T}\\right) = \\frac{n}{N_C(T)} \\exp\\left(\\frac{E_C}{k_B T}\\right)$.\nNow we rewrite the exponential term in equation $(2)$:\n$$\n\\exp\\left(\\frac{E_D - E_F}{k_B T}\\right) = \\exp\\left(\\frac{E_D}{k_B T}\\right) \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_F}{k_B T}\\right) = \\exp\\left(\\frac{E_D}{k_B T}\\right) \\frac{N_C(T)}{n} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_C}{k_B T}\\right) = \\frac{N_C(T)}{n} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_C - E_D}{k_B T}\\right)\n$$\nLet $\\Delta E_D = E_C - E_D$ be the donor ionization energy. The term becomes $\\frac{N_C(T)}{n} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta E_D}{k_B T}\\right)$.\n\nSubstituting this back into the charge neutrality condition $n = N_D^+$ gives:\n$$\nn = N_D \\frac{g_D \\frac{N_C(T)}{n} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta E_D}{k_B T}\\right)}{1 + g_D \\frac{N_C(T)}{n} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta E_D}{k_B T}\\right)}\n$$\nMultiplying the numerator and denominator of the fraction by $n$ yields:\n$$\nn = N_D \\frac{g_D N_C(T) \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta E_D}{k_B T}\\right)}{n + g_D N_C(T) \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta E_D}{k_B T}\\right)}\n$$\nThis can be rearranged into a quadratic equation for $n$:\n$$\nn \\left(n + g_D N_C(T) \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta E_D}{k_B T}\\right)\\right) = N_D g_D N_C(T) \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta E_D}{k_B T}\\right)\n$$\n$$\nn^2 + n \\left(g_D N_C(T) \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta E_D}{k_B T}\\right)\\right) - N_D g_D N_C(T) \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta E_D}{k_B T}\\right) = 0\n$$\nFor numerical stability, it is preferable to multiply the entire equation by $\\exp\\left(\\frac{\\Delta E_D}{k_B T}\\right)$, which gives an equivalent form:\n$$\nn^2 \\exp\\left(\\frac{\\Delta E_D}{k_B T}\\right) + n g_D N_C(T) - N_D g_D N_C(T) = 0\n$$\nThis is a standard quadratic equation of the form $A n^2 + B n + C = 0$, with coefficients:\n$A = \\exp\\left(\\frac{\\Delta E_D}{k_B T}\\right)$\n$B = g_D N_C(T)$\n$C = -N_D g_D N_C(T)$\n\nThe physically valid (positive) solution for $n$ is given by the quadratic formula:\n$$\nn(T) = \\frac{-B + \\sqrt{B^2 - 4AC}}{2A} = \\frac{-g_D N_C(T) + \\sqrt{\\left(g_D N_C(T)\\right)^2 + 4 \\exp\\left(\\frac{\\Delta E_D}{k_B T}\\right) N_D g_D N_C(T)}}{2 \\exp\\left(\\frac{\\Delta E_D}{k_B T}\\right)}\n$$\nThis expression provides the electron concentration $n$ as an explicit function of temperature $T$ and the material parameters.\n\nThe problem requires finding the temperature $T_{0.1}$ where the electron concentration is $10\\%$ below the full saturation value, i.e., $n(T_{0.1}) = 0.9 N_D$. This defines a nonlinear equation for $T$:\n$$\nf(T) = n(T) - 0.9 N_D = 0\n$$\nThis equation must be solved numerically for $T_{0.1}$ within the specified search interval of $[1, 600]\\ \\mathrm{K}$. A bracketed root-finding method, such as the Brent-Dekker method, is appropriate. As $T \\to 0$, $n(T) \\to 0$, so $f(T) \\to -0.9 N_D$. As $T$ becomes large, donors become fully ionized, $n(T) \\to N_D$, so $f(T) \\to 0.1 N_D$. A root is guaranteed to exist.\n\nOnce $T_{0.1}$ is determined, the minority carrier (hole) concentration $p(T_{0.1})$ is found using the law of mass action, $np = n_i^2$, where $n_i$ is the intrinsic carrier concentration.\n$$\np(T_{0.1}) = \\frac{n_i^2(T_{0.1})}{n(T_{0.1})}\n$$\nGiven $n(T_{0.1}) = 0.9 N_D$, we have:\n$$\np(T_{0.1}) = \\frac{n_i^2(T_{0.1})}{0.9 N_D}\n$$\nThe intrinsic concentration squared, $n_i^2(T)$, is given by:\n$$\nn_i^2(T) = N_C(T) N_V(T) \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_g(T)}{k_B T}\\right)\n$$\nwhere $N_V(T)$ is the effective density of states in the valence band and $E_g(T)$ is the temperature-dependent bandgap. The problem provides the necessary expressions:\n-   $N_C(T) = 2 \\left(\\frac{2 \\pi m_e^\\ast k_B T}{h^2}\\right)^{3/2}$ and $N_V(T) = 2 \\left(\\frac{2 \\pi m_h^\\ast k_B T}{h^2}\\right)^{3/2}$, where $k_B$ must be in SI units ($\\mathrm{J/K}$) for dimensional consistency.\n-   $E_g(T) = E_g(0) - \\frac{\\alpha T^2}{T + \\beta}$, where energies are in $\\mathrm{eV}$ and $k_B$ in the exponential term must be in $\\mathrm{eV/K}$.\n\nThe numerical procedure is as follows:\n1.  For each test case, define all material constants ($N_D, \\Delta E_D, g_D, E_g(0), \\alpha, \\beta, m_e^\\ast, m_h^\\ast$). Convert densities to SI units ($\\mathrm{m}^{-3}$).\n2.  Implement functions for $N_C(T)$, $N_V(T)$, $E_g(T)$, and the derived $n(T)$.\n3.  Define the root-finding function $f(T) = n(T) - 0.9 N_D$.\n4.  Use a numerical solver to find the root $T_{0.1}$ of $f(T)=0$ in the interval $[1, 600]\\ \\mathrm{K}$.\n5.  At $T_{0.1}$, calculate $N_C(T_{0.1})$, $N_V(T_{0.1})$, and $E_g(T_{0.1})$.\n6.  Compute $n_i^2(T_{0.1})$.\n7.  Compute $p(T_{0.1}) = n_i^2(T_{0.1}) / (0.9 N_D)$.\n8.
