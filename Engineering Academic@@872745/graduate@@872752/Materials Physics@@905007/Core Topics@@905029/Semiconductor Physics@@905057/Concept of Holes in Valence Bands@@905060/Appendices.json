Therefore, a solution will be provided.\n\nThe problem requires the derivation of two quantities: the ratio of hole populations in the heavy-hole and light-hole bands, and a transport effective mass. This will be approached in two parts, starting from the fundamental definitions as instructed.\n\nPart 1: Derivation of the hole population ratio $p_{hh}/p_{lh}$.\n\nThe concentration of holes, $p_i$, in a given subband $i$ (where $i$ represents either heavy holes, $hh$, or light holes, $lh$) is determined by integrating the product of the density of states per unit volume, $g_i(E)$, and the probability of a state at energy $E$ being occupied by a hole, $f_h(E)$.

This expression is valid for $E \\le E_v$.\n\nThe hole distribution function $f_h(E)$ is the probability that a state at energy $E$ is empty of an electron, which is $1$ minus the Fermi-Dirac distribution $f_e(E)$:\n$$\nf_h(E) = 1 - f_e(E) = 1 - \\frac{1}{\\exp\\left(\\frac{E-E_F}{k_B T}\\right) + 1} = \\frac{1}{\\exp\\left(\\frac{E_F-E}{k_B T}\\right) + 1}\n$$\nThe problem states that the hole gas is non-degenerate, with the Fermi level $E_F$ satisfying $E_v - E_F \\gg k_B T$. For any energy $E$ in the valence band, $E \\le E_v$. This implies that $E_F - E = (E_F - E_v) + (E_v - E)$ is a large negative value in units of $k_B T$.

To express it solely in terms of $m_{hh}$ and $m_{lh}$, we must use the relationship between the hole populations and their masses derived in Part 1. We found that $p_i \\propto (m_i)^{3/2}$. Let $p_{hh} = C(m_{hh})^{3/2}$ and $p_{lh} = C(m_{lh})^{3/2}$ for some constant $C$.\nSubstituting these into the expression for $m_{tr}$:\n$$\nm_{tr} = \\frac{C(m_{hh})^{3/2} + C(m_{lh})^{3/2}}{\\frac{C(m_{hh})^{3/2}}{m_{hh}} + \\frac{C(m_{lh})^{3/2}}{m_{lh}}}\n$$\nThe constant $C$ cancels from the numerator and denominator:\n$$\nm_{tr} = \\frac{(m_{hh})^{3/2} + (m_{lh})^{3/2}}{(m_{hh})^{3/2-1} + (m_{lh})^{3/2-1}} = \\frac{m_{hh}^{3/2} + m_{lh}^{3/2}}{m_{hh}^{1/2} + m_{lh}^{1/2}}\n$$\nThis is the final expression for the transport effective mass, expressed, as required, in terms of only the heavy-hole and light-hole effective masses.

Therefore, the function $\\mathcal{F}(\\varepsilon)$ becomes:\n$$\\mathcal{F}(\\varepsilon) \\propto \\tau \\cdot \\left(\\frac{2\\varepsilon}{m_h^*}\\right) \\cdot (C \\varepsilon^{1/2}) \\cdot f_h(\\varepsilon) \\propto \\varepsilon^{3/2} f_h(\\varepsilon)$$\nSubstituting $f_h(\\varepsilon) \\propto \\exp(-\\varepsilon/k_B T)$:\n$$\\mathcal{F}(\\varepsilon) \\propto \\varepsilon^{3/2} \\exp(-\\varepsilon/k_B T)$$\nNow we can compute the ratio of integrals for the average transported kinetic energy:\n$$\\frac{\\langle \\varepsilon \\mathcal{F}(\\varepsilon) \\rangle}{\\langle \\mathcal{F}(\\varepsilon) \\rangle} = \\frac{\\int_0^\\infty \\varepsilon \\cdot \\varepsilon^{3/2} \\exp(-\\varepsilon/k_B T) d\\varepsilon}{\\int_0^\\infty \\varepsilon^{3/2} \\exp(-\\varepsilon/k_B T) d\\varepsilon} = \\frac{\\int_0^\\infty \\varepsilon^{5/2} \\exp(-\\varepsilon/k_B T) d\\varepsilon}{\\int_0^\\infty \\varepsilon^{3/2} \\exp(-\\varepsilon/k_B T) d\\varepsilon}$$\nThese integrals are of the form of the Gamma function, $\\int_0^\\infty x^n e^{-ax} dx = \\frac{\\Gamma(n+1)}{a^{n+1}}$.\nNumerator: $(k_B T)^{7/2} \\Gamma(7/2)$\nDenominator: $(k_B T)^{5/2} \\Gamma(5/2)$\nThe ratio is:\n$$\\frac{(k_B T)^{7/2} \\Gamma(7/2)}{(k_B T)^{5/2} \\Gamma(5/2)} = k_B T \\frac{\\Gamma(7/2)}{\\Gamma(5/2)} = k_B T \\frac{(5/2)\\Gamma(5/2)}{\\Gamma(5/2)} = \\frac{5}{2} k_B T$$\nThe Seebeck coefficient is thus:\n$$S_p = \\frac{1}{eT} \\left( \\frac{5}{2} k_B T - \\mu_p \\right)$$\nAnd the Peltier coefficient is:\n$$\\Pi_p = S_p T = \\frac{1}{e} \\left( \\frac{5}{2} k_B T - \\mu_p \\right)$$\nThis expression depends on the hole chemical potential $\\mu_p$. The next step is to relate $\\mu_p$ to the given hole concentration $p$. The concentration is given by the integral of the density of states multiplied by the distribution function:\n$$p = \\int_0^\\infty g(\\varepsilon) f_h(\\varepsilon) d\\varepsilon = \\int_0^\\infty C \\varepsilon^{1/2} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\varepsilon-\\mu_p}{k_B T}\\right) d\\varepsilon$$\n$$p = C \\exp\\left(\\frac{\\mu_p}{k_B T}\\right) \\int_0^\\infty \\varepsilon^{1/2} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\varepsilon}{k_B T}\\right) d\\varepsilon$$\nThe integral evaluates to $(k_B T)^{3/2} \\Gamma(3/2) = (k_B T)^{3/2} \\frac{\\sqrt{\\pi}}{2}$. Substituting the constant $C=\\frac{(2m_h^*)^{3/2}}{2\\pi^2\\hbar^3}$:\n$$p = \\frac{(2m_h^*)^{3/2}}{2\\pi^2\\hbar^3} \\exp\\left(\\frac{\\mu_p}{k_B T}\\right) (k_B T)^{3/2} \\frac{\\sqrt{\\pi}}{2} = 2\\left(\\frac{m_h^* k_B T}{2\\pi \\hbar^2}\\right)^{3/2} \\exp\\left(\\frac{\\mu_p}{k_B T}\\right)$$\nThe pre-factor is, by definition, the effective density of states in the valence band, $N_V$:\n$$N_V = 2\\left(\\frac{m_h^* k_B T}{2\\pi \\hbar^2}\\right)^{3/2}$$\nThus, we have the required relation:\n$$p = N_V \\exp\\left(\\frac{\\mu_p}{k_B T}\\right)$$\nFrom this, we solve for $\\mu_p$:\n$$\\frac{\\mu_p}{k_B T} = \\ln\\left(\\frac{p}{N_V}\\right) \\implies \\mu_p = k_B T \\ln\\left(\\frac{p}{N_V}\\right)$$\nSubstituting this expression for $\\mu_p$ into our formula for $\\Pi_p$:\n$$\\Pi_p = \\frac{1}{e} \\left( \\frac{5}{2} k_B T - k_B T \\ln\\left(\\frac{p}{N_V}\\right) \\right) = \\frac{k_B T}{e} \\left( \\frac{5}{2} - \\ln\\left(\\frac{p}{N_V}\\right) \\right)$$\nThis can be written as:\n$$\\Pi_p = \\frac{k_B T}{e} \\left( \\frac{5}{2} + \\ln\\left(\\frac{N_V}{p}\\right) \\right)$$\nNow we can compute the numerical value using the provided data:\n$T = 300\\,\\mathrm{K}$\n$p = 1.0 \\times 10^{16}\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-3}$\n$N_V = 1.04 \\times 10^{19}\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-3}$\n$e = 1.602176634 \\times 10^{-19}\\,\\mathrm{C}$\n$k_B = 1.380649 \\times 10^{-23}\\,\\mathrm{J\\,K^{-1}}$\n\nFirst, we calculate the thermal voltage $k_B T/e$:\n$$\\frac{k_B T}{e} = \\frac{(1.380649 \\times 10^{-23}\\,\\mathrm{J\\,K^{-1}}) \\times (300\\,\\mathrm{K})}{1.602176634 \\times 10^{-19}\\,\\mathrm{C}} \\approx 0.025852\\,\\mathrm{V}$$\nNext, we calculate the argument of the logarithm:\n$$\\frac{N_V}{p} = \\frac{1.04 \\times 10^{19}\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-3}}{1.0 \\times 10^{16}\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-3}} = 1040$$\nThe natural logarithm is $\\ln(1040) \\approx 6.947$.\nSubstituting these values into the expression for $\\Pi_p$:\n$$\\Pi_p \\approx (0.025852\\,\\mathrm{V}) \\left( 2.5 + 6.947 \\right) = (0.025852\\,\\mathrm{V}) \\times (9.447) \\approx 0.24424\\,\\mathrm{V}$$\nRounding to three significant figures, the Peltier coefficient is $0.244\\,\\mathrm{V}$.\n\nFinally, we address the physical meaning of the Peltier coefficient. Throughout this derivation, we have treated the hole as a quasiparticle with positive charge $q=+e$. The Peltier coefficient $\\Pi_p$ is defined as the heat current density per unit electric current density, $\\Pi_p = J_Q/J$, under isothermal conditions. Therefore, it represents the amount of heat energy transported per unit of charge. The quantity $e \\Pi_p$ is the average heat transported per moving hole. Our derived expression $e \\Pi_p = (\\frac{5}{2} k_B T - \\mu_p)$ shows that this heat consists of two components. The term $\\frac{5}{2} k_B T$ is the average kinetic energy of the holes that contribute to the current, which is larger than the thermal average kinetic energy of $\\frac{3}{2} k_B T$ because higher-energy holes are more mobile and contribute disproportionately to the current. The term $-\\mu_p = E_F - E_V$ is the potential energy required to create a hole at the band edge relative to the Fermi level. Therefore, the Peltier coefficient represents the average transported thermal energy of a charge carrier relative to the chemical potential, divided by its charge.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.244}$$", "id": "2810452"}]}
