We classify these points by examining the Hessian matrix of second derivatives:\n$$ H(\\mathbf{k}) = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{\\partial^2 \\varepsilon_{0}}{\\partial k_{x}^2}  0 \\\\ 0  \\frac{\\partial^2 \\varepsilon_{0}}{\\partial k_{y}^2} \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 2t \\cos k_{x}  0 \\\\ 0  2t \\cos k_{y} \\end{pmatrix} $$\n\n-   At $\\mathbf{k} = (0,0)$ (the $\\Gamma$ point):\n    $H(0,0) = \\begin{pmatrix} 2t  0 \\\\ 0  2t \\end{pmatrix}$. The eigenvalues are both positive. This is a local minimum, corresponding to the bottom of the band. The energy is $\\varepsilon_{min} = \\varepsilon_{0}(0,0) = -4t$.\n\n-   At $\\mathbf{k} = (\\pi,\\pi)$ (the $M$ point):\n    $H(\\pi,\\pi) = \\begin{pmatrix} -2t  0 \\\\ 0  -2t \\end{pmatrix}$. The eigenvalues are both negative. This is a local maximum, corresponding to the top of the band.

In both cases, the eigenvalues have opposite signs. These are saddle points. The energy at these points is identical: $\\varepsilon_{saddle} = \\varepsilon_{0}(0,\\pi) = \\varepsilon_{0}(\\pi,0) = 0$.\n\nThe problem specifies that the van Hove energy is the energy at the saddle points. Thus, the van Hove energy is $E_{vH} = 0$.\n\n**2. Analysis of the Fermi Surface Topology**\n\nThe Fermi surface is the contour in $\\mathbf{k}$-space defined by $\\varepsilon_{0}(\\mathbf{k}) = \\mu$, or $\\cos k_x + \\cos k_y = -\\mu/(2t)$. We analyze its topology as the chemical potential $\\mu$ is tuned through $E_{vH} = 0$.\n\n-   For $\\mu  0$ (e.g., $-4t  \\mu  0$):\n    The band is less than half-filled. The equation is $\\cos k_x + \\cos k_y = C$ with $C  0$. The Fermi surface is a closed, diamond-like contour centered around the band minimum at $\\mathbf{k}=(0,0)$. This is conventionally termed an \"electron-like\" pocket.\n\n-   For $\\mu = 0$ ($E_{vH}$):\n    The equation becomes $\\cos k_x + \\cos k_y = 0$. This surface passes through the saddle points $(\\pi,0)$ and $(0,\\pi)$. The contour is a square with vertices at $(\\pm\\pi, 0)$ and $(0, \\pm\\pi)$, which connects across the boundaries of the BZ. This topology supports \"open orbits\" for an electron moving in a magnetic field perpendicular to the plane.\n\n-   For $\\mu  0$ (e.g., $0  \\mu  4t$):\n    The band is more than half-filled. The equation is $\\cos k_x + \\cos k_y = C$ with $C  0$. It is more convenient to describe the unoccupied states (holes). The holes occupy states around the band maximum at $\\mathbf{k}=(\\pi,\\pi)$. The Fermi surface, viewed as the boundary of the sea of holes, is a closed contour centered on $(\\pi,\\pi)$. This is a \"hole-like\" pocket. The electron Fermi surface itself becomes an open, connected network.\n\nTherefore, as $\\mu$ increases through $E_{vH}=0$, a topological change, known as a Lifshitz transition, occurs. The Fermi surface topology transitions from a closed electron pocket to open orbits, and then to a closed hole pocket (or, equivalently, an open electron surface).\n\n**3. Analysis of the Density of States**\n\nThe density of states (DOS) per unit area is given by\n$$ N(E) = \\frac{1}{(2\\pi)^2} \\int_{\\text{BZ}} d^2k\\, \\delta(E - \\varepsilon_0(\\mathbf{k})) = \\frac{1}{(2\\pi)^2} \\oint_{\\varepsilon_0(\\mathbf{k})=E} \\frac{dl}{|\\nabla_{\\mathbf{k}} \\varepsilon_0(\\mathbf{k})|} $$\nA singularity is expected at $E = E_{vH} = 0$ because the denominator $|\\nabla_{\\mathbf{k}} \\varepsilon_0(\\mathbf{k})|$ vanishes at the saddle points.\nLet us analyze the DOS contribution from the vicinity of a saddle point, for instance, $\\mathbf{k}_s = (0,\\pi)$. Let $\\mathbf{k} = \\mathbf{k}_s + \\mathbf{q}$. For small $\\mathbf{q}=(q_x, q_y)$, we expand the energy:\n$$ \\varepsilon_0(\\mathbf{k}) = -2t(\\cos q_x + \\cos(\\pi+q_y)) = -2t(\\cos q_x - \\cos q_y) $$\n$$ \\approx -2t\\left( (1-\\frac{q_x^2}{2}) - (1-\\frac{q_y^2}{2}) \\right) = t(q_y^2 - q_x^2) $$\nThe DOS contribution for energy $E$ near $E_{vH}=0$ is proportional to the integral:\n$$ N(E) \\propto \\int d q_x \\int d q_y \\, \\delta(E - t(q_y^2 - q_x^2)) $$\nThis is a standard integral for a 2D saddle point. Let $\\epsilon = E/t$. The integral becomes $\\int dq_x \\int dq_y \\, \\delta(\\epsilon - (q_y^2 - q_x^2))$. This integral evaluates to a function that diverges logarithmically as $\\epsilon \\to 0$. Specifically, $N(E) \\propto -\\ln|E - E_{vH}|$.\n\nThus, the DOS for the 2D square lattice exhibits a symmetric logarithmic divergence at the energy of the saddle points.\n\n**4. Evaluation of Options**\n\nWe now evaluate each statement based on our derivations.\n\n*   **A. As $\\mu$ increases from negative to positive through the van Hove energy, the Fermi surface changes from a closed electron-like pocket around $\\mathbf{k}=(0,0)$ to a closed hole-like pocket around $\\mathbf{k}=(\\pi,\\pi)$. The two-dimensional density of states $N(E)$ exhibits a logarithmic divergence at $E$ equal to the van Hove energy due to the saddle points at $\\mathbf{k}=(\\pi,0)$ and $\\mathbf{k}=(0,\\pi)$.**\n    This statement is fully consistent with our analysis. The description of the Fermi surface topology change is a correct characterization of the Lifshitz transition. The statement about the logarithmic divergence of the DOS at the saddle point energy is also correct. **Correct.**\n\n*   **B. As $\\mu$ crosses the van Hove energy, the Fermi surface remains a single simply connected closed contour centered at $\\mathbf{k}=(0,0)$, and $N(E)$ is analytic through the van Hove energy with a finite cusp but no divergence.**\n    This statement is incorrect on two counts. First, the Fermi surface topology fundamentally changes, it does not remain a closed contour around $\\mathbf{k}=(0,0)$ for $\\mu  0$. Second, $N(E)$ is not analytic; it possesses a logarithmic divergence, which is stronger than a finite cusp. **Incorrect.**\n\n*   **C. As $\\mu$ crosses the van Hove energy, the Fermi surface opens into open orbits that traverse the Brillouin Zone for all $\\mu$ above the van Hove energy, and $N(E)$ vanishes as $|E|^{1/2}$ at the van Hove energy.**\n    This statement is incorrect. Open orbits are characteristic of the Fermi surface precisely *at* the van Hove energy $\\mu=0$, not for all $\\mu  0$. For $\\mu  0$, the topology is more accurately described by closed hole pockets. Furthermore, $N(E)$ diverges logarithmically, it does not vanish as $|E|^{1/2}$. **Incorrect.**\n\n*   **D. The Fermi surface topology does not change across the van Hove energy because saddle points do not affect topology; however, $N(E)$ diverges as $1/|E|$ at the van Hove energy.**\n    This statement is flagrantly incorrect. The premise that saddle points do not affect topology is fundamentally false; they are the very cause of such topological transitions. The claim that the DOS diverges as $1/|E|$ is also incorrect; the divergence is logarithmic. **Incorrect.**\n\nOnly statement A provides a correct and physically sound description of the phenomena.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2810725"}]}
