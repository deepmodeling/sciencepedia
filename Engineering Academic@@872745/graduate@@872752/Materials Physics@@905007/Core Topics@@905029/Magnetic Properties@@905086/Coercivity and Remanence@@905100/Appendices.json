The analysis must be performed on the descending branch of the hysteresis loop, starting from positive saturation. According to the problem statement, the magnetization $M$ remains constant at its saturation value, $M = +M_s$, until the internal magnetic field $H_{\\text{int}}$ reaches the switching threshold of $-H_k$. All calculations will be performed under this condition, with a final check to ensure the events occur prior to or at the point of magnetization reversal. All quantities are in SI units.\n\nThe fundamental relationships provided are:\nThe internal magnetic field:\n$$H_{\\text{int}} = H_{\\text{app}} - N M$$\nThe magnetic flux density (induction):\n$$B = \\mu_{0}(H_{\\text{int}} + M)$$\nThe intrinsic induction (magnetic polarization):\n$$J = \\mu_{0}M$$\n\nOn the descending branch starting from positive saturation, the magnetization is fixed at $M = +M_s$. This holds as long as the internal field $H_{\\text{int}}$ has not reached the negative switching threshold, i.e., $H_{\\text{int}}  -H_k$.\n\nFirst, we determine the apparent coercivity of induction, $H_{cB}$. This is defined as the magnitude of the reverse applied field, $H_{\\text{app}}$, at which the induction $B$ becomes zero. We set $B=0$ in its defining equation:\n$$B = \\mu_{0}(H_{\\text{int}} + M) = 0$$\nThis implies that the condition for zero induction is:\n$$H_{\\text{int}} + M = 0 \\quad \\implies \\quad H_{\\text{int}} = -M$$\nOn the descending branch, we have $M = +M_s$. Thus, the internal field at which $B=0$ is:\n$$H_{\\text{int}} = -M_s$$\nTo find the corresponding applied field, we substitute this value into the expression for the internal field:\n$$H_{\\text{int}} = H_{\\text{app}} - N M$$\n$$-M_s = H_{\\text{app}} - N(+M_s)$$\nSolving for $H_{\\text{app}}$ gives the applied field at which $B$ is zero:\n$$H_{\\text{app}} = N M_s - M_s = (N-1)M_s$$\nThe coercivity $H_{cB}$ is the magnitude of this applied field. Since the demagnetizing factor $N$ is in the range $0 \\le N \\le 1$, the term $(N-1)$ is less than or equal to zero. Therefore, $H_{\\text{app}} = (N-1)M_s$ is a non-positive value, consistent with a reverse field. The magnitude is:\n$$H_{cB} = |(N-1)M_s| = -(N-1)M_s = (1-N)M_s$$\nThis result is valid only if the magnetization has not yet switched. Switching occurs when $H_{\\text{int}} = -H_k$. The zero-crossing of $B$ occurs when $H_{\\text{int}} = -M_s$. The problem imposes the constraint $H_k \\ge M_s$, which is equivalent to $|-H_k| \\ge |-M_s|$. As $H_{\\text{app}}$ becomes more negative, $H_{\\text{int}}$ also becomes more negative. Therefore, the internal field reaches the value $-M_s$ before or at the same time it reaches $-H_k$. Thus, the magnetization is indeed $+M_s$ when $B=0$, and the calculation of $H_{cB}$ is valid.\n\nSecond, we determine the apparent intrinsic coercivity, $H_{cJ}$. This is defined as the magnitude of the reverse applied field at which the intrinsic induction $J$ becomes zero. The condition $J=0$ implies:\n$$J = \\mu_{0}M = 0 \\quad \\implies \\quad M = 0$$\nFor the specified ideal rectangular hysteresis loop, the magnetization is never zero; it switches abruptly from $M=+M_s$ to $M=-M_s$. The problem statement clarifies that $H_{cJ}$ corresponds to the applied field at which this reversal occurs. The condition for reversal on the descending branch is that the internal field reaches the negative switching threshold:\n$$H_{\\text{int}} = -H_k$$\nAt the instant just before switching, the magnetization is still $M=+M_s$. We use the relation for the internal field to find the required applied field:\n$$H_{\\text{int}} = H_{\\text{app}} - N M$$\n$$-H_k = H_{\\text{app}} - N(+M_s)$$\nSolving for the applied field at the point of switching:\n$$H_{\\text{app}} = N M_s - H_k$$\nThe intrinsic coercivity $H_{cJ}$ is the magnitude of this applied field:\n$$H_{cJ} = |N M_s - H_k|$$\nGiven the constraint $H_k \\ge M_s$ and the property $0 \\le N \\le 1$, it follows that $N M_s \\le M_s \\le H_k$. Therefore, the expression $N M_s - H_k$ is non-positive. Its magnitude is:\n$$H_{cJ} = -(N M_s - H_k) = H_k - N M_s$$\nThis is the apparent coercivity related to magnetization reversal, as measured by an external apparatus controlling $H_{\\text{app}}$.\n\nThe final result is the two-component row vector containing $H_{cB}$ and $H_{cJ}$.\n$$H_{cB} = (1-N)M_s$$\n$$H_{cJ} = H_k - NM_s$$\nBoth expressions have units of amperes per meter (A/m), consistent with magnetic field strength.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} (1-N)M_s  H_k - NM_s \\end{pmatrix}}$$", "id": "2808811"}, {"introduction": "The Stoner-Wohlfarth model provides a static, zero-temperature picture of coercivity, but in reality, thermal energy plays a decisive role in magnetization reversal.
