It contains all necessary information for a unique solution. We shall proceed with the derivation as requested.\n\nThe problem requires a three-part analysis for a transition-metal complex with a $d^6$ electronic configuration in an octahedral ligand field.\n\nFirst, we must derive the energy offsets of the $t_{2g}$ and $e_{g}$ orbitals with respect to the barycenter. Let the energy of the barycenter be the reference energy, set to $0$. Let $E_{t_{2g}}$ and $E_{e_{g}}$ be the energies of the $t_{2g}$ and $e_{g}$ levels, respectively. The degeneracies are $g_{t_{2g}} = 3$ and $g_{e_{g}} = 2$.\n\nThe conservation of the barycenter (the energy-weighted mean of the levels) is expressed as:\n$$g_{t_{2g}} E_{t_{2g}} + g_{e_{g}} E_{e_{g}} = 0$$\nSubstituting the degeneracies, we have:\n$$3 E_{t_{2g}} + 2 E_{e_{g}} = 0 \\quad (1)$$\n\nThe total energy separation between the levels is given as the crystal field splitting parameter, $\\Delta$:\n$$E_{e_{g}} - E_{t_{2g}} = \\Delta \\quad (2)$$\n\nWe have a system of two linear equations with two unknowns, $E_{t_{2g}}$ and $E_{e_{g}}$. From equation $(2)$, we express $E_{e_{g}}$ as $E_{e_{g}} = E_{t_{2g}} + \\Delta$. Substituting this into equation $(1)$:\n$$3 E_{t_{2g}} + 2 (E_{t_{2g}} + \\Delta) = 0$$\n$$3 E_{t_{2g}} + 2 E_{t_{2g}} + 2\\Delta = 0$$\n$$5 E_{t_{2g}} = -2\\Delta$$\n$$E_{t_{2g}} = -\\frac{2}{5}\\Delta = -0.4\\Delta$$\n\nSubstituting this result back into the expression for $E_{e_{g}}$:\n$$E_{e_{g}} = \\left(-\\frac{2}{5}\\Delta\\right) + \\Delta = \\frac{3}{5}\\Delta = +0.6\\Delta$$\nThus, the $t_{2g}$ orbitals are stabilized by an energy of $0.4\\Delta$ and the $e_{g}$ orbitals are destabilized by an energy of $0.6\\Delta$ relative to the barycenter.\n\nSecond, we compute the Ligand Field Stabilization Energy (LFSE) for the high-spin and low-spin configurations of a $d^6$ ion. The LFSE is calculated as the sum of the energies of the electrons in the split orbitals.\n$$ \\text{LFSE} = n_{t_{2g}} \\cdot E_{t_{2g}} + n_{e_{g}} \\cdot E_{e_{g}} = n_{t_{2g}}(-0.4\\Delta) + n_{e_{g}}(+0.6\\Delta) $$\nwhere $n_{t_{2g}}$ and $n_{e_{g}}$ are the electron occupancies of the respective orbitals.\n\nFor the high-spin (HS) configuration, electrons occupy orbitals to maximize total spin, according to Hund's rule. For a $d^6$ ion, this results in the configuration $(t_{2g})^4(e_g)^2$.\nThe occupancies are $n_{t_{2g}}^{\\text{HS}} = 4$ and $n_{e_{g}}^{\\text{HS}} = 2$.\nThe LFSE for the high-spin state is:\n$$ \\text{LFSE}_{\\text{HS}} = 4(-0.4\\Delta) + 2(+0.6\\Delta) = -1.6\\Delta + 1.2\\Delta = -0.4\\Delta $$\n\nFor the low-spin (LS) configuration, electrons first fill the lower-energy $t_{2g}$ orbitals completely.

The total energy includes the LFSE and the spin-pairing energy, $P$. The total stabilization energy, $E_{\\text{stab}}$, is the sum of the LFSE and the change in pairing energy relative to the spherically symmetric free ion ground state.\nThe ground state configuration of a free $d^6$ ion, by Hund's rule, has one pair of electrons.\n\nIn the high-spin $(t_{2g})^4(e_g)^2$ configuration, there is one electron pair (in one of the $t_{2g}$ orbitals). The number of pairs is the same as in the free ion, so the change in pairing energy is $0$.\n$$ E_{\\text{stab}}^{\\text{HS}} = \\text{LFSE}_{\\text{HS}} + 0 \\cdot P = -0.4\\Delta $$\n\nIn the low-spin $(t_{2g})^6(e_g)^0$ configuration, there are three electron pairs.

We can therefore use the multipole expansion of the potential in powers of $r/R$.

The $d$-orbitals are states of definite parity (even, or gerade, $g$). The matrix element $\\langle \\psi | H' | \\psi \\rangle$ is non-zero only for even-parity terms in $H'$. The term $(r/R)^l P_l$ has parity $(-1)^l$. Consequently, only terms with even $l$ can contribute to the first-order energy shifts of the $d$-levels. This eliminates $l=1, 3, 5, \\dots$ from consideration.\n\nLet's inspect the first few even-$l$ terms.\nThe $l=0$ term:\n$H'_{l=0} = \\frac{eq}{R} (r/R)^0 \\sum_j P_0(\\hat{\\boldsymbol{r}} \\cdot \\hat{\\boldsymbol{R}}_j) = \\frac{eq}{R} N$, where $N$ is the number of ligands ($N=6$ for octahedral, $N=4$ for tetrahedral).

We will construct the $2 \\times 2$ Hamiltonian matrix in the basis $\\{ |^{4}T_{1g}(F)\\rangle, |^{4}T_{1g}(P)\\rangle \\}$.\n\nThe matrix elements are $H_{ij} = \\langle i | H | j \\rangle = \\langle i | H_{\\text{Coul}} | j \\rangle + \\langle i | H_{\\text{CF}} | j \\rangle$, for $i,j \\in \\{ |^{4}T_{1g}(F)\\rangle, |^{4}T_{1g}(P)\\rangle \\}$.\n\nThe Coulomb Hamiltonian, $H_{\\text{Coul}}$, describes the electron-electron repulsion in the free ion. Its eigenfunctions are the Russell-Saunders terms. Thus, $H_{\\text{Coul}}$ is diagonal in a basis of free-ion states. The states $|^{4}T_{1g}(F)\\rangle$ and $|^{4}T_{1g}(P)\\rangle$ are constructed from the corresponding $|^{4}F\\rangle$ and $|^{4}P\\rangle$ free-ion terms. Therefore, $H_{\\text{Coul}}$ is also diagonal in this symmetry-adapted basis.\nThe diagonal elements are the energies of the free-ion terms. By convention, the ground term energy is set to zero. Thus, $\\langle ^{4}T_{1g}(F) | H_{\\text{Coul}} | ^{4}T_{1g}(F) \\rangle = E_F = 0$.\nThe energy of the $^{4}P$ term relative to the $^{4}F$ term is given as $15B$. Thus, $\\langle ^{4}T_{1g}(P) | H_{\\text{Coul}} | ^{4}T_{1g}(P) \\rangle = E_P = 15B$.\nThe off-diagonal elements are zero: $\\langle ^{4}T_{1g}(F) | H_{\\text{Coul}} | ^{4}T_{1g}(P) \\rangle = 0$.\n\nThe crystal field Hamiltonian, $H_{\\text{CF}}$, acts as a perturbation. For $d$-electrons in an octahedral field, the potential can be expanded in spherical harmonics. The part of the potential that lifts degeneracy without just shifting all energies is constructed from spherical tensors of rank $k=4$. This operator is invariant under the operations of the octahedral group, meaning it transforms as the totally symmetric representation $A_{1g}$. The matrix elements of $H_{\\text{CF}}$ are proportional to the crystal field strength parameter $\\Delta$.\nLet's denote the matrix elements of $H_{\\text{CF}}$ as $\\langle L' | H_{\\text{CF}} | L \\rangle = q_{L'L}\\Delta$, where $L, L'$ correspond to the F ($L=3$) and P ($L=1$) terms. This gives the matrix for $H_{\\text{CF}}$ in our basis:\n$$ H_{\\text{CF}} = \\begin{pmatrix} q_{FF}\\Delta  q_{FP}\\Delta \\\\ q_{PF}\\Delta  q_{PP}\\Delta \\end{pmatrix} $$\nSince $H_{\\text{CF}}$ is a Hermitian operator, its matrix representation is Hermitian. For real basis functions, this matrix is symmetric, so $q_{PF} = q_{FP}$.\n\nCombining the matrices for $H_{\\text{Coul}}$ and $H_{\\text{CF}}$, the total Hamiltonian matrix is:\n$$ H_{T_{1g}}(\\Delta, B) = \\begin{pmatrix} E_F + q_{FF}\\Delta  q_{FP}\\Delta \\\\ q_{FP}\\Delta  E_P + q_{PP}\\Delta \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} q_{FF}\\Delta  q_{FP}\\Delta \\\\ q_{FP}\\Delta  15B + q_{PP}\\Delta \\end{pmatrix} $$\nThis confirms the general form presented in the problem statement.\n\nNext, we must explain why $q_{PP}=0$. The parameter $q_{PP}$ corresponds to the first-order energy shift of the $^{4}P$ term due to the crystal field. This matrix element is $\\langle ^{4}T_{1g}(P) | H_{\\text{CF}} | ^{4}T_{1g}(P) \\rangle$. The operator $H_{\\text{CF}}$ acts as a spherical tensor of rank $k=4$. The state $|^{4}P\\rangle$ has orbital angular momentum $L=1$. The Wigner-Eckart theorem imposes selection rules on the matrix elements of tensor operators. For a diagonal matrix element $\\langle \\alpha L M | T^{(k)}_q | \\alpha L M \\rangle$ to be non-zero, the angular momenta must satisfy the triangle inequality $|L-L| \\le k \\le L+L$, which simplifies to $k \\le 2L$. In our case, $k=4$ and $L=1$. The condition becomes $4 \\le 2(1)$, or $4 \\le 2$, which is false. Therefore, the matrix element must be zero.\nThe problem provides a definition for $q_{LL'}$ which contains a $6j$-symbol, $\\begin{Bmatrix} L'  4  L \\\\ 2  2  2 \\end{Bmatrix}$. For the term $q_{PP}$, we have $L=L'=1$. The $6j$-symbol becomes $\\begin{Bmatrix} 1  4  1 \\\\ 2  2  2 \\end{Bmatrix}$. For a $6j$-symbol $\\{j_1 j_2 j_3; j_4 j_5 j_6\\}$ to be non-zero, the angular momenta in each of the four corresponding triads must satisfy triangle inequalities. One such triad is $(j_1, j_2, j_3)$, which for our case is $(1, 4, 1)$. The triangle inequality $|j_1-j_2| \\le j_3 \\le j_1+j_2$ must hold. Substituting the values gives $|1-4| \\le 1 \\le 1+4$, which is $3 \\le 1 \\le 5$. The condition $3 \\le 1$ is not satisfied. Thus, the $6j$-symbol is identically zero, which forces $q_{PP}=0$.\n\nWith $q_{PP}=0$, the Hamiltonian matrix simplifies to:\n$$ H_{T_{1g}} = \\begin{pmatrix} q_{FF}\\Delta  q_{FP}\\Delta \\\\ q_{FP}\\Delta  15B \\end{pmatrix} $$\n\nTo find the energy eigenvalues, we solve the characteristic equation $\\det(H_{T_{1g}} - E \\cdot I) = 0$, where $E$ represents the eigenvalues and $I$ is the $2 \\times 2$ identity matrix.\n$$ \\det \\begin{pmatrix} q_{FF}\\Delta - E  q_{FP}\\Delta \\\\ q_{FP}\\Delta  15B - E \\end{pmatrix} = 0 $$\n$$ (q_{FF}\\Delta - E)(15B - E) - (q_{FP}\\Delta)^2 = 0 $$\n$$ E^2 - (15B + q_{FF}\\Delta)E + 15B(q_{FF}\\Delta) - (q_{FP}\\Delta)^2 = 0 $$\nThis is a quadratic equation in $E$. The solutions are given by the quadratic formula:\n$$ E = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} $$\nwith $a=1$, $b=-(15B + q_{FF}\\Delta)$, and $c=15B(q_{FF}\\Delta) - (q_{FP}\\Delta)^2$.\n$$ E = \\frac{(15B + q_{FF}\\Delta) \\pm \\sqrt{(-(15B + q_{FF}\\Delta))^2 - 4(1)(15B q_{FF}\\Delta - q_{FP}^2\\Delta^2)}}{2} $$\nLet's simplify the discriminant:\n$$ \\sqrt{(15B + q_{FF}\\Delta)^2 - 60B q_{FF}\\Delta + 4q_{FP}^2\\Delta^2} $$\n$$ = \\sqrt{(15B)^2 + 30B q_{FF}\\Delta + (q_{FF}\\Delta)^2 - 60B q_{FF}\\Delta + 4q_{FP}^2\\Delta^2} $$\n$$ = \\sqrt{(15B)^2 - 30B q_{FF}\\Delta + (q_{FF}\\Delta)^2 + 4q_{FP}^2\\Delta^2} $$\n$$ = \\sqrt{(15B - q_{FF}\\Delta)^2 + 4q_{FP}^2\\Delta^2} $$\nSubstituting this back into the solution for $E$ gives the two energy eigenvalues, which we denote $E_-$ and $E_+$. They are conventionally ordered by energy, with $E_-$ being the lower energy.\n$$ E_{\\pm} = \\frac{1}{2} \\left[ 15B + q_{FF}\\Delta \\pm \\sqrt{(15B - q_{FF}\\Delta)^2 + 4q_{FP}^2\\Delta^2} \\right] $$\nThe ordered pair of eigenvalues, from lower to higher energy, is $(E_-, E_+)$.\n$E_{-} = \\frac{1}{2} \\left( 15B + q_{FF}\\Delta - \\sqrt{(15B - q_{FF}\\Delta)^2 + 4q_{FP}^2\\Delta^2} \\right)$\n$E_{+} = \\frac{1}{2} \\left( 15B + q_{FF}\\Delta + \\sqrt{(15B - q_{FF}\\Delta)^2 + 4q_{FP}^2\\Delta^2} \\right)$\nThese are the final analytic closed-form expressions for the energies of the two $^{4}T_{1g}$ states.", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{1}{2} \\left( 15B + q_{FF}\\Delta - \\sqrt{(15B - q_{FF}\\Delta)^{2} + 4q_{FP}^{2}\\Delta^{2}} \\right)  \\frac{1}{2} \\left( 15B + q_{FF}\\Delta + \\sqrt{(15B - q_{FF}\\Delta)^{2} + 4q_{FP}^{2}\\Delta^{2}} \\right) \\end{pmatrix}} $$", "id": "2811476"}]}
