It is scientifically grounded, free of contradictions, and contains all necessary information for a rigorous derivation. The problem is therefore deemed **valid**. We proceed to the solution.\n\n(a) The assumptions of the Einstein model for the vibrational properties of a crystalline solid are as follows:\n$1$. The solid is composed of $N$ identical atoms arranged in a regular crystal lattice.\n$2$. Each atom vibrates about its fixed equilibrium lattice site. The vibrations of different atoms are assumed to be entirely independent of one another.\n$3$. The motion of each atom is isotropic and can be decomposed into three independent one-dimensional simple harmonic oscillators, corresponding to the three spatial dimensions. Consequently, the entire solid is modeled as a collection of $3N$ independent one-dimensional quantum harmonic oscillators (QHOs).\n$4$. All $3N$ of these QHOs are assumed to vibrate with the same, single characteristic angular frequency, denoted as $\\omega_{E}$. This is the central and most drastic simplification of the model.\n\n(b) The derivation of the heat capacity $C_{V}(T)$ proceeds from the fundamental principles provided.\n\nFirst, we determine the canonical partition function for a single one-dimensional quantum harmonic oscillator, $Z_{1}$. The energy levels are given as $E_{n} = \\hbar \\omega_{E} \\left(n + \\frac{1}{2}\\right)$ for $n \\in \\{0, 1, 2, \\dots\\}$. The partition function $Z_{1}$ is the sum over all states:\n$$Z_{1} = \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} \\exp(-\\beta E_{n}) = \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} \\exp\\left(-\\beta \\hbar \\omega_{E} \\left(n + \\frac{1}{2}\\right)\\right)$$\nwhere $\\beta = 1/(k_{B}T)$. We can factor out the term independent of the summation index $n$:\n$$Z_{1} = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\beta \\hbar \\omega_{E}}{2}\\right) \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} \\exp(-n \\beta \\hbar \\omega_{E}) = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\beta \\hbar \\omega_{E}}{2}\\right) \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} \\left[\\exp(-\\beta \\hbar \\omega_{E})\\right]^{n}$$\nThe sum is a geometric series of the form $\\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} x^{n} = 1/(1-x)$ with $x = \\exp(-\\beta \\hbar \\omega_{E})$. The condition for convergence, $|x| < 1$, is satisfied since $T > 0$, which implies $\\beta \\hbar \\omega_{E} > 0$ and $\\exp(-\\beta \\hbar \\omega_{E}) < 1$. Therefore, the partition function for a single oscillator is:\n$$Z_{1} = \\frac{\\exp(-\\beta \\hbar \\omega_{E}/2)}{1 - \\exp(-\\beta \\hbar \\omega_{E})}$$\n\nAccording to the model assumptions, the solid consists of $3N$ independent and identical (and distinguishable by their lattice sites) oscillators. The total partition function of the system, $Z$, is the product of the individual partition functions:\n$$Z = (Z_{1})^{3N} = \\left[ \\frac{\\exp(-\\beta \\hbar \\omega_{E}/2)}{1 - \\exp(-\\beta \\hbar \\omega_{E})} \\right]^{3N}$$\nFor the calculation of thermodynamic properties, it is more convenient to work with the natural logarithm of the partition function:\n$$\\ln Z = 3N \\ln Z_{1} = 3N \\left[ \\ln\\left(\\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\beta \\hbar \\omega_{E}}{2}\\right)\\right) - \\ln\\left(1 - \\exp(-\\beta \\hbar \\omega_{E})\\right) \\right]$$\n$$\\ln Z = 3N \\left[ -\\frac{\\beta \\hbar \\omega_{E}}{2} - \\ln\\left(1 - \\exp(-\\beta \\hbar \\omega_{E})\\right) \\right]$$\n\nNext, we calculate the total internal energy $U$ of the solid using the relation $U = -\\frac{\\partial \\ln Z}{\\partial \\beta}$:\n$$U = -\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\beta} \\left( 3N \\left[ -\\frac{\\beta \\hbar \\omega_{E}}{2} - \\ln\\left(1 - \\exp(-\\beta \\hbar \\omega_{E})\\right) \\right] \\right)$$\n$$U = -3N \\left[ -\\frac{\\hbar \\omega_{E}}{2} - \\frac{1}{1 - \\exp(-\\beta \\hbar \\omega_{E})} \\cdot (-\\exp(-\\beta \\hbar \\omega_{E})) \\cdot (-\\hbar \\omega_{E}) \\right]$$\n$$U = -3N \\left[ -\\frac{\\hbar \\omega_{E}}{2} - \\frac{\\hbar \\omega_{E} \\exp(-\\beta \\hbar \\omega_{E})}{1 - \\exp(-\\beta \\hbar \\omega_{E})} \\right]$$\n$$U = 3N \\hbar \\omega_{E} \\left[ \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{\\exp(-\\beta \\hbar \\omega_{E})}{1 - \\exp(-\\beta \\hbar \\omega_{E})} \\right]$$\nTo simplify the fraction, we can multiply the numerator and denominator by $\\exp(\\beta \\hbar \\omega_{E})$:\n$$\\frac{\\exp(-\\beta \\hbar \\omega_{E})}{1 - \\exp(-\\beta \\hbar \\omega_{E})} = \\frac{1}{\\exp(\\beta \\hbar \\omega_{E}) - 1}$$\nThe internal energy becomes:\n$$U = 3N \\hbar \\omega_{E} \\left[ \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{\\exp(\\beta \\hbar \\omega_{E}) - 1} \\right] = \\frac{3N \\hbar \\omega_{E}}{2} + \\frac{3N \\hbar \\omega_{E}}{\\exp(\\beta \\hbar \\omega_{E}) - 1}$$\nThe first term is the constant zero-point energy of the crystal, which does not depend on temperature.\n\nFinally, we find the heat capacity at constant volume, $C_{V} = \\left(\\frac{\\partial U}{\\partial T}\\right)_{V}$.

We will proceed with a full derivation and analysis.\n\n### Derivation\nWe begin from first principles of the canonical ensemble. The energy levels of a single quantum harmonic oscillator of angular frequency $\\omega_E$ are given by $E_n = \\hbar \\omega_E (n + 1/2)$, where $n=0, 1, 2, ...$.\n\nThe partition function for a single mode is:\n$$Z_1 = \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} e^{-\\beta E_n} = \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} e^{-\\beta \\hbar \\omega_E (n + 1/2)} = e^{-\\beta \\hbar \\omega_E/2} \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} (e^{-\\beta \\hbar \\omega_E})^n$$\nThis is a geometric series, which converges to:\n$$Z_1 = \\frac{e^{-\\beta \\hbar \\omega_E/2}}{1 - e^{-\\beta \\hbar \\omega_E}} = \\frac{1}{2 \\sinh(\\beta \\hbar \\omega_E/2)}$$\nwhere $\\beta = 1/(k_B T)$.\n\nThe average energy of a single mode is:\n$$\\langle E \\rangle_1 = -\\frac{\\partial \\ln Z_1}{\\partial \\beta} = -\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\beta} \\left[ -\\frac{\\beta \\hbar \\omega_E}{2} - \\ln(1 - e^{-\\beta \\hbar \\omega_E}) \\right]$$\n$$\\langle E \\rangle_1 = \\frac{\\hbar \\omega_E}{2} + \\frac{\\hbar \\omega_E e^{-\\beta \\hbar \\omega_E}}{1 - e^{-\\beta \\hbar \\omega_E}} = \\frac{\\hbar \\omega_E}{2} + \\frac{\\hbar \\omega_E}{e^{\\beta \\hbar \\omega_E} - 1}$$\nThe constant-volume heat capacity for a single mode, $C_{V}^{(\\mathrm{mode})}$, is the derivative of the average energy with respect to temperature:\n$$C_{V}^{(\\mathrm{mode})} = \\frac{\\partial \\langle E \\rangle_1}{\\partial T} = \\frac{\\partial \\langle E \\rangle_1}{\\partial \\beta} \\frac{d\\beta}{dT} = \\left[ -\\frac{(\\hbar \\omega_E)^2 e^{\\beta \\hbar \\omega_E}}{(e^{\\beta \\hbar \\omega_E} - 1)^2} \\right] \\left( -\\frac{1}{k_B T^2} \\right)$$\n$$C_{V}^{(\\mathrm{mode})} = k_B \\left( \\frac{\\hbar \\omega_E}{k_B T} \\right)^2 \\frac{e^{\\hbar \\omega_E / k_B T}}{(e^{\\hbar \\omega_E / k_B T} - 1)^2}$$\nLet us define the Einstein temperature $\\Theta_E = \\hbar\\omega_E/k_B$. The expression becomes:\n$$C_{V}^{(\\mathrm{mode})} = k_B \\left(\\frac{\\Theta_E}{T}\\right)^2 \\frac{e^{\\Theta_E/T}}{\\left(e^{\\Theta_E/T} - 1\\right)^2}$$\nThe problem states that each atom contributes $3$ independent modes.

The constant-volume heat capacity per atom, $C_{V}^{(\\mathrm{atom})}$, is the sum of the contributions of the $3$ independent harmonic modes associated with that atom, and the molar constant-volume heat capacity per mole of atoms is $C_{V,m} = N_A\\, C_{V}^{(\\mathrm{atom})}$.**\n\nThe first part of the statement is correct by the principle of extensivity for independent subsystems. Energy and heat capacity are additive, so $C_{V}^{(\\mathrm{atom})}$ is the sum of the heat capacities of its $3$ modes.\nThe second part of the statement provides the definition of a molar quantity based on a per-particle quantity. A mole of atoms contains $N_A$ atoms. Therefore, the heat capacity of one mole of atoms is the heat capacity per atom, $C_{V}^{(\\mathrm{atom})}$, multiplied by Avogadro's number, $N_A$. This correctly defines $C_{V,m}$ as the heat capacity per mole of atoms. The statement is entirely correct.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. Because all atoms have the same Einstein frequency, the per-atom and molar constant-volume heat capacities are identical: $C_{V}^{(\\mathrm{atom})} = C_{V,m}$.**\n\nThis statement is fundamentally incorrect. $C_{V}^{(\\mathrm{atom})}$ is a quantity per atom, with units of energy per temperature (e.g., Joules/Kelvin). $C_{V,m}$ is a quantity per mole of atoms, with units of energy per mole per temperature (e.g., Joules/(mol⋅Kelvin)). They are related by Avogadro's number, $N_A$, as established in option A: $C_{V,m} = N_A C_{V}^{(\\mathrm{atom})}$. Since $N_A \\approx 6.022 \\times 10^{23} \\text{mol}^{-1}$ is not a dimensionless unity, the two quantities are not identical. The premise \"Because all atoms have the same Einstein frequency\" is irrelevant to the claimed equality and does not justify it.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. Using the ideal-gas constant $R$ defined by $R = N_A k_B$, the high-temperature limits in the Einstein model satisfy $C_{V}^{(\\mathrm{atom})} \\to 3 k_B$ and $C_{V,m} \\to 3 R$.**\n\nWe must evaluate the high-temperature limit ($T \\to \\infty$). This corresponds to the limit $\\Theta_E/T \\to 0$. Let $x = \\Theta_E/T$.\n$$C_{V}^{(\\mathrm{mode})} = k_B x^2 \\frac{e^x}{(e^x - 1)^2}$$\nFor small $x$, we use the Taylor expansion $e^x \\approx 1 + x + \\frac{x^2}{2} + \\dots$.\nThe denominator becomes $(e^x - 1)^2 \\approx (x + \\frac{x^2}{2})^2 = x^2(1 + \\frac{x}{2})^2 \\approx x^2$. The numerator is $e^x \\approx 1$.\nSo, in the limit $x \\to 0$:\n$$C_{V}^{(\\mathrm{mode})} \\to k_B$$\nThis is the classical equipartition theorem result for one harmonic oscillator (which has two quadratic degrees of freedom, for kinetic and potential energy, each contributing $k_B/2$).\nUsing this limit, we find the limits for the other quantities:\n1.  $C_{V}^{(\\mathrm{atom})} = 3 \\, C_{V}^{(\\mathrm{mode})} \\to 3 \\, k_B$. This part is correct.\n2.  $C_{V,m} = N_A \\, C_{V}^{(\\mathrm{atom})} \\to N_A (3 \\, k_B) = 3 (N_A k_B)$. Given $R = N_A k_B$, this becomes $3R$. This part is also correct.\nThe statement matches the derived high-temperature limits, which represent the classical Law of Dulong and Petit.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**D. For a crystalline solid with $p$ atoms per formula unit, the molar constant-volume heat capacity per mole of formula units is $C_{V,m}^{(\\mathrm{formula})} = p N_A\\, C_{V}^{(\\mathrm{atom})}$ at all temperatures, and in the classical high-temperature limit $C_{V,m}^{(\\mathrm{formula})} \\to 3 p R$.**\n\nA \"mole of formula units\" contains $N_A$ formula units. Since each formula unit contains $p$ atoms, one mole of formula units contains a total of $p N_A$ atoms.\nThe total heat capacity of this system is the number of atoms multiplied by the heat capacity per atom.\nTotal $C_V = (p N_A) \\times C_{V}^{(\\mathrm{atom})}$.\nThe molar heat capacity per mole of formula units, $C_{V,m}^{(\\mathrm{formula})}$, is this total heat capacity divided by $1$ mole.\nThus, $C_{V,m}^{(\\mathrm{formula})} = p N_A C_{V}^{(\\mathrm{atom})}$. This relation holds at all temperatures, as it is based on the definitions of the quantities. The first part of the statement is correct.\nFor the high-temperature limit, we substitute the limit for $C_{V}^{(\\mathrm{atom})}$ from our analysis of option C: $C_{V}^{(\\mathrm{atom})} \\to 3k_B$.\n$C_{V,m}^{(\\mathrm{formula})} \\to p N_A (3 k_B) = 3p (N_A k_B)$.\nUsing the definition $R = N_A k_B$, the limit becomes $3pR$. This confirms the second part of the statement. Therefore, the entire statement is correct.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**E. To convert a molar constant-volume heat capacity into a per-atom value, multiply by Avogadro’s number: $C_{V}^{(\\mathrm{atom})} = N_A\\, C_{V,m}$.**\n\nThis statement expresses a relationship that is the inverse of the correct one. As established in the analysis of option A, the relationship between the molar heat capacity (per mole of atoms) and the per-atom heat capacity is $C_{V,m} = N_A C_{V}^{(\\mathrm{atom})}$.\nTo find the per-atom value from the molar value, one must divide by Avogadro's number:\n$C_{V}^{(\\mathrm{atom})} = \\frac{C_{V,m}}{N_A}$.\nMultiplying a molar quantity by $N_A$ yields the total quantity for one mole, not the per-particle quantity.

It is more convenient to calculate this via $\\beta$, using $C_V = \\frac{\\partial U}{\\partial \\beta} \\frac{d\\beta}{dT} = \\frac{\\partial U}{\\partial \\beta} \\left(-\\frac{1}{k_B T^2}\\right) = -k_B \\beta^2 \\frac{\\partial U}{\\partial \\beta}$.\nDifferentiating $U$ with respect to $\\beta$:\n$$\\frac{\\partial U}{\\partial \\beta} = 3N \\hbar \\omega_E \\left[(-1)\\left(\\exp(\\beta \\hbar \\omega_E) - 1\\right)^{-2} \\cdot \\exp(\\beta \\hbar \\omega_E) \\cdot (\\hbar \\omega_E)\\right] = -3N(\\hbar \\omega_E)^2 \\frac{\\exp(\\beta \\hbar \\omega_E)}{(\\exp(\\beta \\hbar \\omega_E) - 1)^2}$$\nThus, the heat capacity is:\n$$C_V = -k_B \\beta^2 \\left[-3N(\\hbar \\omega_E)^2 \\frac{\\exp(\\beta \\hbar \\omega_E)}{(\\exp(\\beta \\hbar \\omega_E) - 1)^2}\\right] = 3N k_B (\\beta \\hbar \\omega_E)^2 \\frac{\\exp(\\beta \\hbar \\omega_E)}{(\\exp(\\beta \\hbar \\omega_E) - 1)^2}$$\nThe problem defines a characteristic temperature $T^{\\ast}$ where $C_V(T^{\\ast})$ equals one-half of the Dulong-Petit limit, $C_V(T^{\\ast}) = \\frac{1}{2} (3N k_B)$. We set up the equation:\n$$\\frac{1}{2} (3N k_B) = 3N k_B \\left(\\frac{\\hbar \\omega_E}{k_B T^{\\ast}}\\right)^2 \\frac{\\exp\\left(\\frac{\\hbar \\omega_E}{k_B T^{\\ast}}\\right)}{\\left(\\exp\\left(\\frac{\\hbar \\omega_E}{k_B T^{\\ast}}\\right) - 1\\right)^2}$$\nLet us define the dimensionless variable $x^{\\ast} = \\frac{\\hbar \\omega_E}{k_B T^{\\ast}}$. The equation simplifies to:\n$$\\frac{1}{2} = (x^{\\ast})^2 \\frac{\\exp(x^{\\ast})}{(\\exp(x^{\\ast}) - 1)^2}$$\nThis is a transcendental equation for $x^{\\ast}$. A plot of the right-hand side as a function of $x^{\\ast}$ shows that it is a monotonically decreasing function for $x^{\\ast} > 0$, ensuring that there is a unique positive solution for $x^{\\ast}$. Let us denote this unique numerical constant by $x_0$. The crucial insight is that this value $x_0$ is universal for any substance within the Einstein model; it does not depend on $\\omega_E$ or any other material-specific parameter.\nTherefore, for any sample, we have the relation:\n$$x_0 = \\frac{\\hbar \\omega_E}{k_B T^{\\ast}}$$\nThis implies that $T^{\\ast}$ is directly proportional to the Einstein frequency $\\omega_E$:\n$$T^{\\ast} = \\frac{\\hbar}{k_B x_0} \\omega_E \\implies T^{\\ast} \\propto \\omega_E$$\nNext, we relate $\\omega_E$ to the atomic mass $m$. The oscillator's angular frequency is given by $\\omega_E = \\sqrt{k_{ifc}/m}$, where $k_{ifc}$ is the interatomic force constant. The problem states that $k_{ifc}$ is independent of isotopic mass. Thus, $\\omega_E$ is inversely proportional to the square root of the atomic mass:\n$$\\omega_E \\propto m^{-1/2}$$\nCombining the two proportionalities, we find the dependence of $T^{\\ast}$ on the atomic mass:\n$$T^{\\ast} \\propto m^{-1/2}$$\nNow, we can compare the two samples, A and B. For sample A, the mass is $m_A = m$ and the characteristic temperature is $T^{\\ast}_A$. For sample B, the mass is $m_B = m + \\Delta m$ and the characteristic temperature is $T^{\\ast}_B$. Using the proportionality, we form a ratio:\n$$\\frac{T^{\\ast}_B}{T^{\\ast}_A} = \\left(\\frac{m_B}{m_A}\\right)^{-1/2} = \\sqrt{\\frac{m_A}{m_B}}$$\nSubstituting the expressions for the masses:\n$$\\frac{T^{\\ast}_B}{T^{\\ast}_A} = \\sqrt{\\frac{m}{m + \\Delta m}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{\\Delta m}{m}}} = \\left(1 + \\frac{\\Delta m}{m}\\right)^{-1/2}$$\nThe problem asks for the fractional shift in the characteristic temperature, which is $\\frac{T^{\\ast}_B - T^{\\ast}_A}{T^{\\ast}_A}$.\n$$\\frac{T^{\\ast}_B - T^{\\ast}_A}{T^{\\ast}_A} = \\frac{T^{\\ast}_B}{T^{\\ast}_A} - 1 = \\left(1 + \\frac{\\Delta m}{m}\\right)^{-1/2} - 1$$\nThis is the final expression, given entirely in terms of the fractional mass change $\\Delta m/m$, as required.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\left(1 + \\frac{\\Delta m}{m}\\right)^{-\\frac{1}{2}} - 1}\n$$", "id": "2817503"}]}
