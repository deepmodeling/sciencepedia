We will proceed with the derivation from first principles as requested.\n\nThe first step is to establish the primitive lattice vectors for the direct and reciprocal lattices of a simple cubic (SC) structure.

This corresponds to the smallest nonzero value of the sum of squares of integers, $h^2 + k^2 + l^2$. The case $(h,k,l)=(0,0,0)$ gives $\\mathbf{G} = \\mathbf{0}$, which corresponds to the undiffracted beam ($q=0$). The smallest nonzero value of $h^2+k^2+l^2$ is $1$, which occurs when one index is $\\pm 1$ and the other two are $0$.

Validation:**\nThe problem is scientifically grounded in the principles of X-ray crystallography. It is well-posed, providing sufficient data to distinguish between the proposed structures. The language is objective and precise. The physical scenario and data are realistic. The core of the problem lies in applying the concept of the structure factor and the associated selection rules for different Bravais lattices. The problem is valid.\n\n### Step 2: Derivation and Analysis\n\nThe fundamental principle for determining the crystal structure from diffraction data is the analysis of the structure factor, $F_{hkl}$. For a crystal with a basis, the structure factor for a reflection indexed by Miller indices $(h,k,l)$ is given by:\n$$F_{hkl} = \\sum_{j=1}^{N} f_j e^{i 2\\pi (h x_j + k y_j + l z_j)}$$\nwhere the sum is over all $N$ atoms in the unit cell, $(x_j, y_j, z_j)$ are the fractional coordinates of the $j$-th atom, and $f_j$ is its atomic form factor. The intensity of the diffracted beam is proportional to $|F_{hkl}|^2$.\n\nA key diagnostic tool is the presence or absence of certain reflections due to destructive interference from atoms at specific positions. These are known as systematic extinctions or selection rules, which are characteristic of the Bravais lattice. For cubic lattices indexed on a conventional cell:\n- **Simple Cubic (SC):** All $(h,k,l)$ reflections are allowed.\n- **Body-Centered Cubic (BCC):** Reflections are allowed only if the sum $h+k+l$ is an even integer.\n- **Face-Centered Cubic (FCC):** Reflections are allowed only if the indices $h,k,l$ are all even or all odd (i.e., not of mixed parity).\n\nThe experimental data show non-zero intensities for the $(100)$ and $(110)$ reflections: $I_{100} = 1.00$ and $I_{110} = 3.58$. The presence of these reflections provides a powerful constraint on the possible Bravais lattice.\n\n- For the $(100)$ reflection: $h=1, k=0, l=0$. The indices are of mixed parity. Also, the sum $h+k+l=1$ is odd.\n- For the $(110)$ reflection: $h=1, k=1, l=0$. The indices are of mixed parity. The sum $h+k+l=2$ is even.\n\nThe observation of a non-zero $(100)$ intensity proves that the Bravais lattice cannot be BCC (since $h+k+l$ is odd) and cannot be FCC (since the indices are of mixed parity). Therefore, the underlying Bravais lattice must be simple cubic.\n\nWe now evaluate each option based on this conclusion.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A) Rock-salt (NaCl-type): face-centered cubic Bravais lattice with a two-atom basis.**\nThe rock-salt structure is based on an FCC Bravais lattice. According to the FCC selection rules, reflections are forbidden if the Miller indices $(h,k,l)$ are of mixed parity. Both $(100)$ and $(110)$ have mixed-parity indices. Therefore, for an NaCl-type structure, the intensities $I_{100}$ and $I_{110}$ must be zero. The experimental data show $I_{100}=1.00$ and $I_{110}=3.58$. This is a direct contradiction.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**B) Cesium chloride (CsCl-type): simple cubic Bravais lattice with a two-atom basis at $(0,0,0)$ and $(\\tfrac{1}{2},\\tfrac{1}{2},\\tfrac{1}{2})$.**\nThis structure is based on a simple cubic (SC) Bravais lattice. An SC lattice does not have any systematic extinctions based on the parity of $(h,k,l)$. Therefore, the observation of $(100)$, $(110)$, and $(111)$ reflections is permitted. Let's perform a quantitative check.\nThe basis consists of atom A at $(0,0,0)$ and atom B at $(\\tfrac{1}{2},\\tfrac{1}{2},\\tfrac{1}{2})$. Their atomic form factors are $f_A$ and $f_B$. The structure factor is:\n$$F_{hkl} = f_A e^{i 2\\pi (0)} + f_B e^{i 2\\pi (h/2 + k/2 + l/2)} = f_A + f_B e^{i \\pi (h+k+l)}$$\nWe analyze two cases for the sum $h+k+l$:\n- If $h+k+l$ is even: $F_{hkl} = f_A + f_B$.\n- If $h+k+l$ is odd: $F_{hkl} = f_A - f_B$.\n\nThe intensities are proportional to $|F_{hkl}|^2$:\n- For $(100)$: $h+k+l=1$ (odd). $I_{100} \\propto |f_A(q_{100}) - f_B(q_{100})|^2$.\n- For $(110)$: $h+k+l=2$ (even). $I_{110} \\propto |f_A(q_{110}) + f_B(q_{110})|^2$.\n- For $(111)$: $h+k+l=3$ (odd). $I_{111} \\propto |f_A(q_{111}) - f_B(q_{111})|^2$.\n\nThe theory predicts that the intensities $I_{100}$ and $I_{111}$ should be nearly equal, as both are proportional to $|f_A - f_B|^2$. The atomic form factors $f_j(q)$ decrease with increasing scattering vector magnitude $q = (2\\pi/a)\\sqrt{h^2+k^2+l^2}$, so we expect $I_{111}$ to be slightly smaller than $I_{100}$.\nThe experimental data are $I_{100} = 1.00$ and $I_{111} = 1.02$. These values are equal to within $2\\%$, which is well within the stated experimental uncertainty of $5\\%$. The slight discrepancy from the theoretical expectation ($I_{111} < I_{100}$) is negligible given the uncertainty.\n\nThe intensity ratio $\\frac{I_{110}}{I_{100}}$ provides a further check. Neglecting the small dependence of form factors on $q$ for this qualitative check, the ratio is:\n$$\\frac{I_{110}}{I_{100}} \\approx \\frac{|f_A + f_B|^2}{|f_A - f_B|^2} = \\frac{3.58}{1.00} = 3.58$$\nTaking the square root gives $\\frac{|f_A + f_B|}{|f_A - f_B|} \\approx \\sqrt{3.58} \\approx 1.89$. Assuming $f_A$ and $f_B$ are real and positive, and letting $r = f_B/f_A$, we get $\\frac{1+r}{1-r} \\approx 1.89$, which yields a ratio of form factors $r \\approx 0.31$. This is a physically reasonable value for an ionic crystal AB.\nThe CsCl structure is fully consistent with the experimental data.\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\n**C) Body-centered cubic of a single element (one atom per primitive cell; identical scatterers).**\nThis structure is based on a BCC Bravais lattice. The selection rule for BCC is that $h+k+l$ must be even.\n- For $(100)$, $h+k+l=1$ (odd), so this reflection is forbidden.\n- For $(111)$, $h+k+l=3$ (odd), so this reflection is forbidden.\nThe model predicts $I_{100}=0$ and $I_{111}=0$, which contradicts the data ($I_{100}=1.00$, $I_{111}=1.02$). Furthermore, this option contradicts the problem statement that the crystal is a \"binary ionic crystal AB,\" not a single element.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**D) Zinc blende (ZnS-type): face-centered cubic Bravais lattice with a two-atom basis at $(0,0,0)$ and $(\\tfrac{1}{4},\\tfrac{1}{4},\\tfrac{1}{4})$.**\nLike the rock-salt structure, the zinc blende structure is based on an FCC Bravais lattice. The selection rules are the same: reflections are forbidden for mixed-parity indices. As established for option A, the observation of reflections $(100)$ and $(110)$ with non-zero intensity rules out an FCC Bravais lattice.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe presence of the $(100)$ reflection, which has mixed-parity indices $(1,0,0)$ and an odd sum $h+k+l=1$, definitively rules out any structure based on an FCC or BCC Bravais lattice. This eliminates options A, C, and D. Option B, the CsCl structure, is based on a simple cubic Bravais lattice, which allows the $(100)$, $(110)$, and $(111)$ reflections.

For a diffraction event occurring at a Bragg angle $\\theta$, the magnitude of the scattering vector, which is equal to the magnitude of the reciprocal lattice vector $\\mathbf{G}_{hkl}$, is related to the magnitude of the incident wavevector $k = |\\mathbf{k}| = 2\\pi/\\lambda$:\n$$\n|\\mathbf{G}_{hkl}| = 2k \\sin\\theta\n$$\nLet a fundamental reflection $(h_1, k_1, l_1)$ be excited by the wavelength $\\lambda_1 = \\lambda$. Let a spurious reflection $(h_2, k_2, l_2)$ be excited by the harmonic contamination $\\lambda_2 = \\lambda/2$. The corresponding wavevectors have magnitudes $k_1 = 2\\pi/\\lambda$ and $k_2 = 2\\pi/(\\lambda/2) = 4\\pi/\\lambda = 2k_1$.\n\nFor these two reflections to appear at the same scattering angle $2\\theta$, they must satisfy Bragg's law at the same Bragg angle $\\theta$.\nFor the fundamental reflection:\n$$\n|\\mathbf{G}_{h_1k_1l_1}| = 2k_1 \\sin\\theta = 2 \\left( \\frac{2\\pi}{\\lambda} \\right) \\sin\\theta\n$$\nFor the harmonic reflection:\n$$\n|\\mathbf{G}_{h_2k_2l_2}| = 2k_2 \\sin\\theta = 2 \\left( \\frac{4\\pi}{\\lambda} \\right) \\sin\\theta\n$$\nBy comparing these two expressions, we obtain the relationship between the magnitudes of the reciprocal lattice vectors:\n$$\n|\\mathbf{G}_{h_2k_2l_2}| = 2 |\\mathbf{G}_{h_1k_1l_1}|\n$$\nFor a cubic crystal system with lattice parameter $a$, the magnitude of the reciprocal lattice vector $\\mathbf{G}_{hkl}$ is given by:\n$$\n|\\mathbf{G}_{hkl}| = \\frac{2\\pi}{a} \\sqrt{h^2 + k^2 + l^2}\n$$\nSubstituting this into our derived relationship yields:\n$$\n\\frac{2\\pi}{a} \\sqrt{h_2^2 + k_2^2 + l_2^2} = 2 \\left( \\frac{2\\pi}{a} \\sqrt{h_1^2 + k_1^2 + l_1^2} \\right)\n$$\nSquaring both sides gives the general condition on the Miller indices for coincident reflections:\n$$\nh_2^2 + k_2^2 + l_2^2 = 4 (h_1^2 + k_1^2 + l_1^2)\n$$\nNext, we apply the selection rules for a face-centered cubic (FCC) lattice, which state that a reflection $(h,k,l)$ is allowed only if the Miller indices $h,k,l$ are all even or all odd. We must find all allowed fundamental reflections $(h_1, k_1, l_1)$ with $N_1 = h_1^2 + k_1^2 + l_1^2 \\leq 20$ for which there exists an allowed spurious reflection $(h_2, k_2, l_2)$ satisfying $N_2 = h_2^2 + k_2^2 + l_2^2 = 4N_1$.\n\nA straightforward solution for the index pairing is $(h_2, k_2, l_2) = (2h_1, 2k_1, 2l_1)$. Let us verify this pairing against the FCC selection rules.\n- If $(h_1, k_1, l_1)$ has indices that are all odd, then $(2h_1, 2k_1, 2l_1)$ will have indices that are all even. Both are allowed FCC reflections.\n- If $(h_1, k_1, l_1)$ has indices that are all even, then $(2h_1, 2k_1, 2l_1)$ will also have indices that are all even. Both are allowed FCC reflections.\nThus, for any allowed FCC reflection $(h_1, k_1, l_1)$, the reflection $(2h_1, 2k_1, 2l_1)$ is also an allowed FCC reflection and satisfies the coincident angle condition. Consequently, all allowed fundamental reflections will have a coincident spurious partner.\n\nThe allowed fundamental FCC reflections $(hkl)$ for which $h^2+k^2+l^2 \\leq 20$ are (listing only one representative from each family of planes):\n-   $(111)$ family: $1^2+1^2+1^2=3$. Spurious partner is $(222)$. ($2^2+2^2+2^2 = 12 = 4 \\times 3$)\n-   $(200)$ family: $2^2+0^2+0^2=4$. Spurious partner is $(400)$. ($4^2+0^2+0^2 = 16 = 4 \\times 4$)\n-   $(220)$ family: $2^2+2^2+0^2=8$. Spurious partner is $(440)$. ($4^2+4^2+0^2 = 32 = 4 \\times 8$)\n-   $(311)$ family: $3^2+1^2+1^2=11$.

($4^2+4^2+4^2 = 48 = 4 \\times 12$)\n-   $(400)$ family: $4^2+0^2+0^2=16$. Spurious partner is $(800)$. ($8^2+0^2+0^2 = 64 = 4 \\times 16$)\n-   $(331)$ family: $3^2+3^2+1^2=19$. Spurious partner is $(662)$. ($6^2+6^2+2^2 = 76 = 4 \\times 19$)\n-   $(420)$ family: $4^2+2^2+0^2=20$. Spurious partner is $(840)$. ($8^2+4^2+0^2 = 80 = 4 \\times 20$)\n\n**2) Filter Thickness Calculation**\n\nThe attenuation of X-ray intensity through a material of thickness $t$ is described by the Beer-Lambert law: $I_{\\text{out}} = I_{\\text{in}} \\exp(-\\mu t)$, where $\\mu$ is the linear attenuation coefficient.\n\nLet the incident and transmitted intensities of the fundamental be $I_{\\text{in}}(\\lambda)$ and $I_{\\text{out}}(\\lambda)$, and for the harmonic be $I_{\\text{in}}(\\lambda/2)$ and $I_{\\text{out}}(\\lambda/2)$. The attenuation coefficients are $\\mu_1 = \\mu(\\lambda)$ and $\\mu_2 = \\mu(\\lambda/2)$.\nThe transmitted intensities are:\n$$\nI_{\\text{out}}(\\lambda) = I_{\\text{in}}(\\lambda) \\exp(-\\mu_1 t)\n$$\n$$\nI_{\\text{out}}(\\lambda/2) = I_{\\text{in}}(\\lambda/2) \\exp(-\\mu_2 t)\n$$\nWe require the ratio of the transmitted intensities to be less than or equal to $q$:\n$$\n\\frac{I_{\\text{out}}(\\lambda/2)}{I_{\\text{out}}(\\lambda)} \\leq q\n$$\nSubstituting the expressions for the transmitted intensities:\n$$\n\\frac{I_{\\text{in}}(\\lambda/2) \\exp(-\\mu_2 t)}{I_{\\text{in}}(\\lambda) \\exp(-\\mu_1 t)} \\leq q\n$$\nThe ratio of incident intensities is given as $r = I_{\\text{in}}(\\lambda/2) / I_{\\text{in}}(\\lambda)$. The inequality becomes:\n$$\nr \\exp(-(\\mu_2 - \\mu_1)t) \\leq q\n$$\nTo find the minimum thickness $t$, we solve the equality:\n$$\nr \\exp(-(\\mu_2 - \\mu_1)t) = q\n$$\n$$\n\\exp(-(\\mu_2 - \\mu_1)t) = \\frac{q}{r}\n$$\nTaking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n$$\n-(\\mu_2 - \\mu_1)t = \\ln\\left(\\frac{q}{r}\\right)\n$$\nSolving for $t$:\n$$\nt = -\\frac{\\ln(q/r)}{\\mu_2 - \\mu_1} = \\frac{\\ln(r/q)}{\\mu_2 - \\mu_1}\n$$\nNow, we substitute the given numerical values:\n$r = 2.0 \\times 10^{-2}$\n$q = 1.0 \\times 10^{-5}$\n$\\mu_1 = 1.20\\,\\text{mm}^{-1}$\n$\\mu_2 = 6.50\\,\\text{mm}^{-1}$\n\nThe ratio $r/q$ is:\n$$\n\\frac{r}{q} = \\frac{2.0 \\times 10^{-2}}{1.0 \\times 10^{-5}} = 2.0 \\times 10^3 = 2000\n$$\nThe difference in attenuation coefficients is:\n$$\n\\mu_2 - \\mu_1 = 6.50\\,\\text{mm}^{-1} - 1.20\\,\\text{mm}^{-1} = 5.30\\,\\text{mm}^{-1}\n$$\nThe minimum thickness $t$ is therefore:\n$$\nt = \\frac{\\ln(2000)}{5.30\\,\\text{mm}^{-1}} \\approx \\frac{7.6009}{5.30\\,\\text{mm}^{-1}} \\approx 1.43413\\,\\text{mm}\n$$\nRounding to three significant figures, the minimum filter thickness is $1.43\\,\\text{mm}$.\n\n**3) Alternative Harmonic Mitigation Strategy**\n\nAn alternative strategy to mitigate harmonic contamination is to use a harmonic rejection mirror in the beamline. This optical element is a flat, smooth mirror (e.g., silicon or a rhodium-coated substrate) set at a small grazing angle of incidence $\\theta_i$ to the X-ray beam. The principle of operation is total external reflection. The critical angle for total external reflection, $\\theta_c$, is energy-dependent, approximately scaling as $\\theta_c \\propto \\lambda \\propto 1/E$, where $E$ is the photon energy. The fundamental energy, corresponding to $\\lambda$, has a larger critical angle than the harmonic energy, corresponding to $\\lambda/2$. By setting the angle of incidence $\\theta_i$ to be between the critical angles of the fundamental and the harmonic ($\\theta_c(\\lambda/2) < \\theta_i < \\theta_c(\\lambda)$), the fundamental beam undergoes total reflection with high efficiency, while the harmonic beam has an angle of incidence greater than its critical angle and is thus poorly reflected, passing through the mirror or being absorbed. This provides effective filtering of the unwanted higher-energy harmonic.", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{1.43} $$", "id": "2803838"}]}
