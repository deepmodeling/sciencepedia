It represents a standard, albeit simplified, model of tracer self-diffusion in a crystalline solid, which is a fundamental topic in materials physics. All necessary parameters and physical constants are provided, and the required assumptions are explicitly stated. Therefore, we may proceed with a formal derivation and solution.\n\nThe problem asks for an explicit expression for the tracer diffusivity, $D^{\\ast}(T)$, derived from first principles, and its subsequent numerical evaluation. We shall construct the argument in a logical sequence, beginning with the connection between macroscopic diffusion and the microscopic random walk of atoms.\n\nFirst, we define diffusivity macroscopically. For diffusion under a concentration gradient, Fick's first law states that the flux of tracer atoms, $J^{\\ast}$, is proportional to the negative of the concentration gradient, $\\nabla C^{\\ast}$. The constant of proportionality is the tracer diffusion coefficient, or diffusivity, $D^{\\ast}$.\n$$J^{\\ast} = -D^{\\ast} \\nabla C^{\\ast}$$\nOur goal is to derive a microscopic expression for this phenomenological coefficient, $D^{\\ast}$.\n\nThe microscopic picture of diffusion is a random walk. For a particle executing a random walk in three dimensions, the mean-square displacement, $\\langle R^2 \\rangle$, after a time $t$ is related to the diffusivity by the Einstein-Smoluchowski relation:\n$$\\langle R^2 \\rangle = 6 D t$$\nIn our case, the diffusing entities are tracer atoms, so we have $\\langle R^2 \\rangle = 6 D^{\\ast} t$. The mean-square displacement can also be expressed in terms of the number of jumps, $n$, and the length of each jump, $l$. For a truly random walk, $\\langle R^2 \\rangle = n l^2$. However, in vacancy-mediated diffusion, the jumps are not uncorrelated. After an atom jumps into a vacancy, there is a higher-than-random probability that its next jump will be back into the same vacancy, as the vacancy is now located at the site the atom just vacated. This backward correlation reduces the net displacement. This effect is quantified by the tracer correlation factor, $f$. For tracer self-diffusion via the vacancy mechanism in an FCC lattice, the problem provides $f = 0.7815$. The corrected expression for the mean-square displacement of the tracer atom is:\n$$\\langle R^2 \\rangle = f n l^2$$\nThe total number of jumps, $n$, made by a single tracer atom in time $t$ is $n = \\Gamma t$, where $\\Gamma$ is the average jump frequency of that atom. Substituting this into the previous equation gives:\n$$\\langle R^2 \\rangle = f \\Gamma t l^2$$\nBy equating the microscopic and macroscopic expressions for $\\langle R^2 \\rangle$, we find the relationship between $D^{\\ast}$ and the microscopic jump parameters:\n$$6 D^{\\ast} t = f \\Gamma t l^2$$\n$$D^{\\ast} = \\frac{1}{6} f \\Gamma l^2$$\nThis expression is fundamental, but incomplete. We must now determine the jump frequency $\\Gamma$ and the jump distance $l$.\n\nThe jump distance, $l$, is the nearest-neighbor distance in the FCC lattice. In an FCC unit cell with lattice parameter $a$, atoms touch along the face diagonal. The length of the face diagonal is $a\\sqrt{2}$. This distance corresponds to twice the nearest-neighbor distance, $2l$.\n$$2l = a\\sqrt{2} \\implies l = \\frac{a}{\\sqrt{2}}$$\nTherefore, $l^2 = \\frac{a^2}{2}$.\n\nThe average jump frequency of a specific tracer atom, $\\Gamma$, is the product of three factors: ($1$) the number of nearest-neighbor sites, which is the coordination number $z$; ($2$) the probability, $X_v$, that any given neighboring site is occupied by a vacancy; and ($3$) the rate, $\\omega$, at which an atom successfully exchanges positions with an adjacent vacancy.\n$$\\Gamma = z X_v \\omega$$\nWe must now derive expressions for $X_v$ and $\\omega$.\n\nThe equilibrium vacancy concentration (atomic fraction), $X_v = n_v / (N+n_v)$ where $n_v$ is the number of vacancies and $N$ is the number of atoms, is determined by minimizing the Gibbs free energy of the crystal with respect to $n_v$. The change in free energy upon introducing $n_v$ vacancies is $\\Delta G = n_v H_v - T\\Delta S$, where $H_v$ is the vacancy formation enthalpy. The entropy change has two parts: a configurational term $S_{conf}$ from arranging the vacancies, and a non-configurational (vibrational) term, which the problem instructs us to neglect.\nThe configurational entropy is given by the Boltzmann formula $S_{conf} = k_B \\ln W$, where $W$ is the number of ways to arrange $n_v$ vacancies on $N_{sites} = N+n_v$ lattice sites:\n$$W = \\binom{N+n_v}{n_v} = \\frac{(N+n_v)!}{N! n_v!}$$\nThe free energy to be minimized is thus:\n$$\\Delta G(n_v) = n_v H_v - k_B T \\ln\\left(\\frac{(N+n_v)!}{N! n_v!}\\right)$$\nTo find the equilibrium $n_v$, we set the derivative with respect to $n_v$ to zero: $\\frac{\\partial(\\Delta G)}{\\partial n_v} = 0$. Using Stirling's approximation for the derivative of a factorial, $\\frac{d(\\ln x!)}{dx} \\approx \\ln x$, we obtain:\n$$H_v - k_B T \\left[ \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial n_v} (\\ln((N+n_v)!) - \\ln(n_v!)) \\right] = 0$$\n$$H_v - k_B T \\left[ \\ln(N+n_v) - \\ln(n_v) \\right] = 0$$\n$$H_v = k_B T \\ln\\left(\\frac{N+n_v}{n_v}\\right) = k_B T \\ln\\left(\\frac{1}{X_v}\\right)$$\nSolving for the vacancy fraction $X_v$:\n$$X_v = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{H_v}{k_B T}\\right)$$\nThe probability that a neighbor site is vacant is simply $X_v$.\n\nNext, we address the jump rate $\\omega$. An atom adjacent to a vacancy can jump into it if it has sufficient thermal energy to overcome the energy barrier for migration, $E_m$. This process is modeled using an Arrhenius expression, where the rate is the product of a vibrational attempt frequency, $\\nu$, and a Boltzmann factor representing the probability of having the required activation energy:\n$$\\omega = \\nu \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_m}{k_B T}\\right)$$\nNow we assemble all the pieces. Substituting the expressions for $\\Gamma$, $X_v$, $\\omega$, and $l^2$ into our equation for $D^{\\ast}$:\n$$D^{\\ast} = \\frac{1}{6} f l^2 \\Gamma = \\frac{1}{6} f \\left(\\frac{a^2}{2}\\right) (z X_v \\omega)$$\n$$D^{\\ast} = \\frac{1}{12} f z a^2 \\left( \\exp\\left(-\\frac{H_v}{k_B T}\\right) \\right) \\left( \\nu \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_m}{k_B T}\\right) \\right)$$\nCombining the exponential terms, we arrive at the final explicit expression for the tracer diffusivity:\n$$D^{\\ast}(T) = \\frac{1}{12} f z \\nu a^2 \\exp\\left(-\\frac{H_v + E_m}{k_B T}\\right)$$\nThis expression takes the classic Arrhenius form $D^{\\ast} = D_0 \\exp(-Q/k_B T)$, where the pre-exponential factor is $D_0 = \\frac{1}{12} f z \\nu a^2$ and the activation energy for diffusion is $Q = H_v + E_m$.\n\nFinally, we evaluate this expression numerically using the provided parameters:\n$f = 0.7815$\n$z = 12$ (for FCC)\n$\\nu = 5.0 \\times 10^{12}\\,\\text{s}^{-1}$\n$a = 3.60 \\times 10^{-10}\\,\\text{m}$\n$H_v = 1.10\\,\\text{eV}$\n$E_m = 0.65\\,\\text{eV}$\n$T = 1000\\,\\text{K}$\n$k_B = 8.617333262 \\times 10^{-5}\\,\\text{eV}\\,\\text{K}^{-1}$\n\nFirst, calculate the activation energy $Q$:\n$$Q = H_v + E_m = 1.10\\,\\text{eV} + 0.65\\,\\text{eV} = 1.75\\,\\text{eV}$$\nNext, calculate the dimensionless exponent $Q / (k_B T)$:\n$$\\frac{Q}{k_B T} = \\frac{1.75\\,\\text{eV}}{(8.617333262 \\times 10^{-5}\\,\\text{eV}\\,\\text{K}^{-1})(1000\\,\\text{K})} \\approx 20.3073$$\nNow compute the Boltzmann factor:\n$$\\exp\\left(-\\frac{Q}{k_B T}\\right) = \\exp(-20.3073) \\approx 1.5159 \\times 10^{-9}$$\nThen compute the pre-exponential factor, $D_0$:\n$$D_0 = \\frac{1}{12} f z \\nu a^2 = \\frac{1}{12} (0.7815) (12) (5.0 \\times 10^{12}\\,\\text{s}^{-1}) (3.60 \\times 10^{-10}\\,\\text{m})^2$$\n$$D_0 = (0.7815) (5.0 \\times 10^{12}\\,\\text{s}^{-1}) (1.296 \\times 10^{-19}\\,\\text{m}^2)$$\n$$D_0 = 5.06412 \\times 10^{-7}\\,\\text{m}^2\\,\\text{s}^{-1}$$\nFinally, we compute $D^{\\ast}(T=1000\\,\\text{K})$:\n$$D^{\\ast} = D_0 \\exp\\left(-\\frac{Q}{k_B T}\\right) = (5.06412 \\times 10^{-7}\\,\\text{m}^2\\,\\text{s}^{-1}) (1.5159 \\times 10^{-9})$$\n$$D^{\\ast} \\approx 7.6766 \\times 10^{-16}\\,\\text{m}^2\\,\\text{s}^{-1}$$\nRounding the result to three significant figures, we obtain the final answer.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{7.68 \\times 10^{-16}}$$", "id": "2814557"}, {"introduction": "While Fick's first law suggests that atoms always flow down a concentration gradient, this is an oversimplification true only for ideal solutions.
