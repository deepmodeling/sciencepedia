There is no ambiguity or subjective content.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is scientifically sound, well-posed, objective, and complete. It is a standard problem in computational engineering. The problem is deemed **valid**. A solution will be furnished.\n\nThe Colebrook equation is a transcendental equation, meaning it cannot be solved for the friction factor $f$ through direct algebraic manipulation. Consequently, a numerical root-finding or iterative method is necessary. We shall employ the fixed-point iteration method, which is robust and efficient for this particular problem.\n\nTo apply fixed-point iteration, we must rearrange the equation into the form $f = g(f)$. A suitable rearrangement is obtained by isolating $f$ on one side. First, we invert the initial equation:\n$$\n\\sqrt{f} = \\frac{1}{-2\\,\\log_{10}\\!\\left(\\frac{\\epsilon/D}{3.7} + \\frac{2.51}{Re\\,\\sqrt{f}}\\right)}\n$$\nSquaring both sides yields the desired fixed-point form:\n$$\nf = \\frac{1}{\\left[-2\\,\\log_{10}\\!\\left(\\frac{\\epsilon/D}{3.7} + \\frac{2.51}{Re\\,\\sqrt{f}}\\right)\\right]^2}\n$$\nThis gives us an iterative scheme where the next approximation for $f$, denoted $f_{k+1}$, is calculated from the current approximation, $f_k$:\n$$\nf_{k+1} = g(f_k) = \\frac{1}{\\left[-2\\,\\log_{10}\\!\\left(\\frac{\\epsilon/D}{3.7} + \\frac{2.51}{Re\\,\\sqrt{f_k}}\\right)\\right]^2}\n$$\nThis iteration is guaranteed to converge to the unique positive root for any physically reasonable initial guess $f_0 > 0$. The derivative of the iteration function, $|g'(f)|$, is less than $1$ over the domain of interest, satisfying the condition for convergence of a contraction mapping.\n\nThe algorithm is as follows:\n1.  For each given pair of $(Re, \\epsilon/D)$, define the constants $C_1 = \\frac{\\epsilon/D}{3.7}$ and $C_2 = \\frac{2.51}{Re}$.\n2.  The iteration function is then $f_{k+1} = \\frac{1}{4 \\left[ \\log_{10}(C_1 + C_2/\\sqrt{f_k}) \\right]^2}$.\n3.  Choose an initial guess for the friction factor, $f_0$. A value of $f_0 = 0.02$ is a common and effective starting point, as it lies within the typical range for turbulent flow friction factors found on the Moody diagram.\n4.  Iterate using the formula for $f_{k+1}$ until the change between successive iterates is negligible, i.e., $|f_{k+1} - f_k| < \\tau$, where $\\tau$ is a small tolerance (e.g., $10^{-10}$).\n5.  The final converged value, $f$, is then rounded to $8$ decimal places as specified.\n\nThis procedure will be implemented for each of the four test cases provided.
