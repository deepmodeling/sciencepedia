Your tasks must start from the fundamental conservation laws and well-tested mathematical facts, and proceed by deriving the similarity reduction to a boundary-value ordinary differential equation, then converting it into a numerically tractable initial-value problem with an unknown initial slope that you determine by enforcing an asymptotic boundary condition.\n\nBegin with the following foundations.\n\n- The steady, two-dimensional, incompressible boundary-layer equations consist of the continuity equation and the streamwise momentum equation written in Cartesian coordinates:\n  - Continuity: $\\dfrac{\\partial u}{\\partial x} + \\dfrac{\\partial v}{\\partial y} = 0$.\n  - Streamwise momentum: $u \\dfrac{\\partial u}{\\partial x} + v \\dfrac{\\partial u}{\\partial y} = \\nu \\dfrac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial y^2}$, where $\\nu$ is the kinematic viscosity and $u(x,y)$ and $v(x,y)$ are the velocity components in the streamwise and wall-normal directions, respectively.\n\n- The boundary conditions are no-slip and no-penetration at the wall and uniform free stream far from the wall:\n  - At the wall $y = 0$: $u(x,0) = 0$, $v(x,0) = 0$.\n  - As $y \\to \\infty$: $u(x,y) \\to U_\\infty$, where $U_\\infty$ is the constant free-stream speed.\n\nTasks to complete:\n\n1. From the governing equations and boundary conditions above, introduce a similarity variable and stream function of the form\n   - $\\psi(x,y) = \\sqrt{\\nu U_\\infty x}\\, f(\\eta)$,\n   - $\\eta = y \\sqrt{\\dfrac{U_\\infty}{\\nu x}}$,\n   and use the definitions $u = \\dfrac{\\partial \\psi}{\\partial y}$ and $v = -\\dfrac{\\partial \\psi}{\\partial x}$ to reduce the partial differential equations to a single boundary-value ordinary differential equation for $f(\\eta)$ together with boundary conditions in the similarity coordinate. You must provide the logical steps that justify that the resulting equation and boundary conditions are dimensionless and do not depend explicitly on $x$, $y$, or on physical parameters other than through the similarity variables.\n\n2. Convert the boundary-value ordinary differential equation into a system of first-order initial-value equations using auxiliary variables (for example, by defining $f = y_1$, $f' = y_2$, and $f'' = y_3$), and identify the unknown initial condition at $\\eta = 0$ that plays the role of a shooting parameter.

Propose an update procedure based on a one-dimensional root-finding method that uses only function evaluations (no derivatives with respect to the shooting parameter are required) to adjust the unknown initial condition. Your update rule must be justified from first principles of root finding for nonlinear equations, and must terminate when a user-specified tolerance in the far-field residual is met. You should discuss how to handle the fact that the computational domain in $\\eta$ is truncated at a finite $\\eta_{\\max}$ and how this affects the residual definition.\n\n4.

Conversion to an Initial-Value Problem (IVP)\n\nThe third-order boundary-value problem (BVP) is converted into a system of three first-order ODEs for numerical integration. We define a state vector $\\mathbf{y}(\\eta) = [y_1, y_2, y_3]^T$, where $y_1 = f$, $y_2 = f'$, and $y_3 = f''$. The system is:\n$$\n\\frac{d}{d\\eta} \\begin{pmatrix} y_1 \\\\ y_2 \\\\ y_3 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} y_2 \\\\ y_3 \\\\ -\\frac{1}{2} y_1 y_3 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe boundary conditions at $\\eta = 0$ provide two of the three required initial conditions:\n$$ y_1(0) = f(0) = 0, \\quad y_2(0) = f'(0) = 0 $$\nThe third initial condition, $y_3(0) = f''(0)$, is unknown. This value, which we denote as $s$, becomes the **shooting parameter**. We guess a value for $s$, solve the IVP from $\\eta=0$ to a large value $\\eta_{\\max}$ that approximates infinity, and check if the far-field boundary condition, $y_2(\\eta_{\\max}) \\approx 1$, is met.\n\n### 3. Update Procedure: The Secant Method\n\nTo find the correct value of $s$ that satisfies the far-field condition, we seek the root of the residual function $R(s) = y_2(\\eta_{\\max}; s) - 1$. The Secant method is a derivative-free root-finding algorithm suitable for this task. Starting with two initial guesses, $s_0$ and $s_1$, it iteratively refines the guess using the update rule:\n$$ s_{k+1} = s_k - R(s_k) \\frac{s_k - s_{k-1}}{R(s_k) - R(s_{k-1})} $$\nThe process continues until the magnitude of the residual, $|R(s_{k+1})|$, is less than a specified tolerance $\\varepsilon$. The choice of $\\eta_{\\max}$ is a compromise: it must be large enough for the solution to be effectively asymptotic, but finite for computational feasibility. The specified test cases use values of $\\eta_{\\max}$ that are generally sufficient for the given tolerances.\n\n### 4.
