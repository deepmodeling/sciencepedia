In this frame, the flow is steady.\n- Upstream (in front of the surge): The fluid approaches the jump with velocity $v_s$ and depth $y_0$.\n- Downstream (behind the surge): The fluid moves away from the jump with velocity $(v_s - u_1)$ and depth $y_1$.\n\nThe conservation of mass (continuity equation) for a channel of unit width is:\n$$\nv_s y_0 = (v_s - u_1) y_1\n$$\nThe conservation of momentum equation is:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{2} g y_0^2 - \\frac{1}{2} g y_1^2 = (v_s - u_1)^2 y_1 - v_s^2 y_0\n$$\nUsing the continuity equation, we can write $\\rho Q_{rel} = \\rho v_s y_0 = \\rho(v_s - u_1) y_1$.
