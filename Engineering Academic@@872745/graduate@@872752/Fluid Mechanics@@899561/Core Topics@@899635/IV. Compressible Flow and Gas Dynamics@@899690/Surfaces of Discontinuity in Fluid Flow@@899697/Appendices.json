By applying the conservation laws, you will derive this maximum heat release, which corresponds to the downstream flow reaching sonic velocity ($M_2=1$).", "problem": "A stationary deflagration front is modeled as a one-dimensional, steady surface of discontinuity in a flow of a compressible, ideal gas. Reactants enter the front at state 1 and exit as products at state 2. The process involves an exothermic chemical reaction, which is modeled as a net heat addition, $q$, per unit mass of the fluid.\n\nThe flow across this front is governed by the following conservation laws, expressed in the reference frame of the stationary front:\n1.  **Mass Conservation:** $\\rho_1 u_1 = \\rho_2 u_2$\n2.  **Momentum Conservation:** $p_1 + \\rho_1 u_1^2 = p_2 + \\rho_2 u_2^2$\n3.  **Energy Conservation:** $h_1 + \\frac{1}{2} u_1^2 + q = h_2 + \\frac{1}{2} u_2^2$\n\nHere, $\\rho$ is the density, $u$ is the fluid velocity, $p$ is the pressure, and $h$ is the specific enthalpy. Subscripts 1 and 2 refer to the upstream (unburnt) and downstream (burnt) states, respectively. The gas is considered ideal, satisfying $p = \\rho R T$ and $h = c_p T$, where $R$ is the specific gas constant, $T$ is the temperature, and $c_p$ is the specific heat at constant pressure. The ratio of specific heats is $\\gamma = c_p/c_v$. The speed of sound is $a = \\sqrt{\\gamma R T}$, and the Mach number is $M = u/a$.\n\nFor a given subsonic upstream state ($M_1  1$), a physically realizable steady downstream state can only be achieved if the amount of heat added, $q$, does not exceed a certain critical value, $q_{max}$. If $q  q_{max}$, the flow is said to be thermally choked, and no steady-state solution exists. This maximum heat addition corresponds to the case where the downstream flow becomes sonic ($M_2=1$), a state known as a Chapman-Jouguet deflagration.\n\nYour task is to derive a closed-form expression for the maximum possible heat release, $q_{max}$, as a function of the upstream Mach number $M_1$, the upstream temperature $T_1$, the specific heat at constant pressure $c_p$, and the ratio of specific heats $\\gamma$.", "solution": "The derivation begins with the fundamental conservation equations for mass, momentum, and energy across the stationary deflagration front. The goal is to relate the heat addition $q$ to the change in Mach number from $M_1$ to $M_2$.\n\nFirst, we rewrite the conservation equations in terms of Mach number.\nThe momentum equation is $p_1 + \\rho_1 u_1^2 = p_2 + \\rho_2 u_2^2$. Using $u^2 = M^2 a^2 = M^2 (\\gamma p / \\rho)$, we can write $\\rho u^2 = \\gamma p M^2$.\nSo, $p_1(1 + \\gamma M_1^2) = p_2(1 + \\gamma M_2^2)$. This gives the pressure ratio:\n$$\n\\frac{p_2}{p_1} = \\frac{1 + \\gamma M_1^2}{1 + \\gamma M_2^2}\n$$\nNext, we combine the mass conservation equation, $\\rho_1 u_1 = \\rho_2 u_2$, with the ideal gas law, $p = \\rho R T$.\n$\\frac{p_1 u_1}{R T_1} = \\frac{p_2 u_2}{R T_2} \\implies \\frac{p_1 M_1 a_1}{T_1} = \\frac{p_2 M_2 a_2}{T_2}$.\nUsing $a = \\sqrt{\\gamma R T}$, we get $\\frac{p_1 M_1 \\sqrt{\\gamma R T_1}}{T_1} = \\frac{p_2 M_2 \\sqrt{\\gamma R T_2}}{T_2}$.\nThis simplifies to $\\frac{p_1 M_1}{\\sqrt{T_1}} = \\frac{p_2 M_2}{\\sqrt{T_2}}$, which yields the temperature ratio:\n$$\n\\frac{T_2}{T_1} = \\left(\\frac{p_2}{p_1} \\frac{M_2}{M_1}\\right)^2\n$$\nSubstituting the pressure ratio into the temperature ratio expression:\n$$\n\\frac{T_2}{T_1} = \\left(\\frac{1 + \\gamma M_1^2}{1 + \\gamma M_2^2} \\frac{M_2}{M_1}\\right)^2\n$$\nNow, consider the energy equation: $h_1 + \\frac{1}{2} u_1^2 + q = h_2 + \\frac{1}{2} u_2^2$.\nUsing $h=c_p T$ and noting that the stagnation enthalpy is $h_0 = h + \\frac{1}{2}u^2$, we have $h_{01} + q = h_{02}$.\nThe stagnation temperature is $T_0 = T(1 + \\frac{\\gamma-1}{2}M^2)$, since $c_p = \\frac{\\gamma R}{\\gamma-1}$ and $a^2 = \\gamma R T$, so $\\frac{u^2}{2 c_p T} = \\frac{M^2 a^2}{2 c_p T} = \\frac{M^2 \\gamma R T}{2 \\frac{\\gamma R}{\\gamma-1} T} = \\frac{\\gamma-1}{2}M^2$.\nThe energy equation becomes $c_p T_{01} + q = c_p T_{02}$, which we can write as:\n$$\nq = c_p (T_{02} - T_{01}) = c_p T_1 \\left( \\frac{T_{02}}{T_1} - \\frac{T_{01}}{T_1} \\right)\n$$\n$$\nq = c_p T_1 \\left[ \\frac{T_2}{T_1} \\left(1 + \\frac{\\gamma-1}{2}M_2^2\\right) - \\left(1 + \\frac{\\gamma-1}{2}M_1^2\\right) \\right]\n$$\nTo simplify, let's define a dimensionless heat addition $Q = \\frac{q}{c_p T_1}$.\n$$\nQ = \\frac{T_2}{T_1} \\left(1 + \\frac{\\gamma-1}{2}M_2^2\\right) - \\left(1 + \\frac{\\gamma-1}{2}M_1^2\\right)\n$$\nSubstitute the expression for $T_2/T_1$:\n$$\nQ = \\left(\\frac{1 + \\gamma M_1^2}{1 + \\gamma M_2^2} \\frac{M_2}{M_1}\\right)^2 \\left(1 + \\frac{\\gamma-1}{2}M_2^2\\right) - \\left(1 + \\frac{\\gamma-1}{2}M_1^2\\right)\n$$\nThis equation relates the heat addition $Q$ to the upstream Mach number $M_1$ and the downstream Mach number $M_2$. For a fixed $M_1$, we want to find the maximum possible value of $Q$, which we denote $Q_{max}$. This corresponds to finding the maximum of the right-hand side with respect to $M_2$.

Let's find the extremum of $f(M_2)$ by differentiating with respect to $M_2^2$ for simplicity. Let $x = M_2^2$.\n$f(x) = \\frac{x (1 + \\frac{\\gamma-1}{2}x)}{(1+\\gamma x)^2}$.\n$$\n\\frac{df}{dx} = \\frac{\\left(1+(\\gamma-1)x\\right)(1+\\gamma x)^2 - x\\left(1+\\frac{\\gamma-1}{2}x\\right) \\cdot 2\\gamma(1+\\gamma x)}{(1+\\gamma x)^4}\n$$\nSetting the numerator to zero:\n$$\n\\left(1+(\\gamma-1)x\\right)(1+\\gamma x) - 2\\gamma x\\left(1+\\frac{\\gamma-1}{2}x\\right) = 0\n$$\n$$\n1 + \\gamma x + (\\gamma-1)x + \\gamma(\\gamma-1)x^2 - 2\\gamma x - \\gamma(\\gamma-1)x^2 = 0\n$$\n$$\n1 + (\\gamma + \\gamma - 1 - 2\\gamma)x = 0 \\implies 1 - x = 0\n$$\nSo, the extremum occurs at $x = 1$, which means $M_2^2 = 1$ or $M_2=1$. A check of the second derivative (or the sign of the first derivative around $x=1$) confirms this is a maximum. This corresponds to the Chapman-Jouguet condition.\n\nNow we find $Q_{max}$ by substituting $M_2=1$ into the expression for $Q$:\n$$\nQ_{max} + \\left(1 + \\frac{\\gamma-1}{2}M_1^2\\right) = \\frac{(1+\\gamma M_1^2)^2}{M_1^2} \\left[ \\frac{1^2 \\left(1 + \\frac{\\gamma-1}{2}\\cdot 1^2\\right)}{(1+\\gamma \\cdot 1^2)^2} \\right]\n$$\n$$\nQ_{max} + \\left(1 + \\frac{\\gamma-1}{2}M_1^2\\right) = \\frac{(1+\\gamma M_1^2)^2}{M_1^2} \\frac{\\left(\\frac{\\gamma+1}{2}\\right)}{(1+\\gamma)^2} = \\frac{(1+\\gamma M_1^2)^2}{2(1+\\gamma)M_1^2}\n$$\nNow, we solve for $Q_{max}$:\n$$\nQ_{max} = \\frac{(1+\\gamma M_1^2)^2}{2(1+\\gamma)M_1^2} - \\left(1 + \\frac{\\gamma-1}{2}M_1^2\\right)\n$$\nTo simplify, find a common denominator:\n$$\nQ_{max} = \\frac{(1+2\\gamma M_1^2 + \\gamma^2 M_1^4) - (1 + \\frac{\\gamma-1}{2}M_1^2) \\cdot 2(1+\\gamma)M_1^2}{2(1+\\gamma)M_1^2}\n$$\n$$\nQ_{max} = \\frac{1+2\\gamma M_1^2 + \\gamma^2 M_1^4 - \\left[2(1+\\gamma)M_1^2 + (\\gamma-1)(1+\\gamma)M_1^4\\right]}{2(1+\\gamma)M_1^2}\n$$\n$$\nQ_{max} = \\frac{1+2\\gamma M_1^2 + \\gamma^2 M_1^4 - (2+2\\gamma)M_1^2 - (\\gamma^2-1)M_1^4}{2(1+\\gamma)M_1^2}\n$$\n$$\nQ_{max} = \\frac{1 + (2\\gamma - 2 - 2\\gamma)M_1^2 + (\\gamma^2 - \\gamma^2 + 1)M_1^4}{2(1+\\gamma)M_1^2}\n$$\n$$\nQ_{max} = \\frac{1 - 2M_1^2 + M_1^4}{2(1+\\gamma)M_1^2} = \\frac{(1-M_1^2)^2}{2(1+\\gamma)M_1^2}\n$$\nFinally, we convert the dimensionless heat release $Q_{max}$ back to the dimensional quantity $q_{max}$ using the definition $Q = q/(c_p T_1)$:\n$$\nq_{max} = c_p T_1 Q_{max} = c_p T_1 \\frac{(1-M_1^2)^2}{2(1+\\gamma)M_1^2}\n$$\nThis is the final expression for the maximum heat release.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{c_p T_1 \\frac{(1-M_1^2)^2}{2(1+\\gamma)M_1^2}}\n$$", "id": "614151"}, {"introduction": "In contrast to subsonic deflagrations, detonations are powerful, supersonic combustion waves sustained by a leading shock.
