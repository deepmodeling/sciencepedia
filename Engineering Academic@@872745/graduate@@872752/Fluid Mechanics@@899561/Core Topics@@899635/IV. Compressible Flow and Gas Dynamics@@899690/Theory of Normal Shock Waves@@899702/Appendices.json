For a given supersonic upstream flow with Mach number $M_1 > 1$ and a specific heat ratio $\\gamma$, these algebraic relations mathematically permit two possible, distinct downstream states. Let's label these as Solution A and Solution B.\n\nSolution A corresponds to the physically observed outcome, where the downstream flow is subsonic, i.e., the downstream Mach number is $M_{2,A}  1$.\n\nSolution B is a second mathematical possibility, where the downstream flow is supersonic, i.e., the downstream Mach number is $M_{2,B}  1$. Although this solution satisfies the conservation laws, it is not observed in nature.\n\nTo understand why Solution B is unphysical and unstable, consider a thought experiment. A point source in the downstream region, far from the shock front, generates a single, infinitesimal pressure disturbance (a sound wave) that propagates upstream towards the stationary shock front. Analyze the ability of this disturbance to reach the shock front for each of the two mathematical solutions.\n\nBased on this analysis of causality, which of the following statements correctly describes the relationship between the downstream flow and the shock front's position?\n\nA. In both Solution A and Solution B, the disturbance reaches the shock front, indicating that the shock position is always influenced by downstream conditions.\n\nB.

In both Solution A and Solution B, the disturbance is swept away downstream, indicating that the shock position is independent of downstream conditions in both cases.\n\nE. The ability of the disturbance to reach the shock depends on the specific heat ratio $\\gamma$ and cannot be determined in general for both solutions without its numerical value.", "solution": "Consider a stationary normal shock located at a fixed position in the laboratory (shock) frame. Let the flow direction be along increasing $x$, with the downstream region at $x>0$. Let a small, infinitesimal pressure disturbance be generated at some point $x=L>0$ in the downstream region and attempt to propagate upstream (toward decreasing $x$) to reach the shock.\n\nFor small-amplitude acoustic disturbances in a uniform flow of speed $u$ with local sound speed $c$, linearized compressible flow theory states that the two characteristic (signal) speeds in the laboratory frame are:\n$$\n\\frac{dx}{dt}=u\\pm c\n$$\nThe upstream-propagating acoustic mode is the one with:\n$$\n\\frac{dx}{dt}=u-c\n$$\nFor a disturbance originating downstream to reach the stationary shock at $x=0$, it must move toward decreasing $x$, i.e., $\\frac{dx}{dt}0$. Applied to the downstream state, this condition is:\n$$\n\\frac{dx}{dt}=u_{2}-c_{2}0\n$$\nwhere $u_{2}$ and $c_{2}$ denote the downstream flow speed and speed of sound, respectively. Introducing the downstream Mach number $M_{2}=u_{2}/c_{2}$, this condition is equivalent to:\n$$\nu_{2}-c_{2}0 \\iff \\frac{u_{2}}{c_{2}}1 \\iff M_{2}1\n$$\n\nApply this to the two mathematical solutions admitted by the Rankine-Hugoniot relations:\n\n1) Solution A (physically observed): $M_{2,A}1$. Then\n$$\nu_{2,A}-c_{2,A}0\n$$\nso the upstream-propagating acoustic disturbance has negative laboratory-frame velocity and can travel from $x=L>0$ to $x=0$. Hence, the disturbance reaches the shock, and the shock position can be causally influenced by downstream conditions.\n\n2) Solution B (mathematical but unphysical): $M_{2,B}>1$. Then\n$$\nu_{2,B}-c_{2,B}>0\n$$\nso even the upstream-propagating acoustic mode is convected downstream in the laboratory frame. The disturbance cannot reach the shock; it is swept away toward increasing $x$. Therefore, the shock position cannot be causally influenced by downstream conditions in this case.\n\nThus, only Solution A permits causal influence of the downstream flow on the shock front, while Solution B does not. This causality argument explains why the supersonic-downstream branch is unphysical and unstable: it cannot accommodate downstream feedback to the discontinuity.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice is that in Solution A the disturbance reaches the shock, whereas in Solution B it is swept away downstream.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1795400"}, {"introduction": "The shock tube is a classic apparatus used to generate and analyze shock waves and high-temperature gas phenomena.
