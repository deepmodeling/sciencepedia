The flow is initially along a flat wall at $y=0$ for $x0$. At $x=0$, the wall turns inward at an angle $\\alpha$, such that for $x0$ the wall is aligned with the line $y = -x \\tan \\alpha$. This geometry creates a decelerating flow region, which can lead to boundary layer separation.\n\nThe flow outside the boundary layer is irrotational and can be described by potential flow theory. For a flow into a corner of this type, the free-stream velocity along the wall is given by $U_e(x) = C x^m$, where $x$ is the distance from the corner at $x=0$, and $C$ is a constant. The exponent $m$ is determined by the turning angle $\\alpha$.\n\nTo analyze the boundary layer development, we use an approximate integral method based on Thwaites' correlation. The momentum thickness $\\theta(x)$ is governed by the relation:\n$$\n\\frac{d}{dx}(U_e^6 \\theta^2) = K \\nu U_e^5\n$$\nwhere $K$ is an empirical constant, which we take to be $K = \\frac{9}{20}$.

We will solve this by first relating the potential flow exponent $m$ to the angle $\\alpha$, then solving the given integral boundary layer equation to find the momentum thickness $\\theta(x)$, using this to calculate the separation parameter $\\lambda$, and finally applying the separation criterion to find $\\alpha$.\n\n**Step 1: Relate the potential flow exponent $m$ to the corner angle $\\alpha$.**\n\nThe flow is in a region bounded by two walls meeting at the origin. For $x0$, the wall is at $y=0$. For $x0$, the wall is at $y=-x\\tan\\alpha$. The total angle of the corner occupied by the fluid is $\\pi + \\alpha$.
