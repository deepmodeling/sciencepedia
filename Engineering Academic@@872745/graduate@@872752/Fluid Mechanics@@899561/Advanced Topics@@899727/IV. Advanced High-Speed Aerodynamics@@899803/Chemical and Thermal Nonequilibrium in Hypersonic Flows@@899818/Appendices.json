Due to the shock compression, the gas will eventually relax to a new downstream equilibrium state ($x \\to \\infty$) characterized by a temperature $T_2$.\n\nIn the region immediately following the shock ($x0$), the gas is in thermal nonequilibrium. The translational-rotational temperature, $T$, is assumed to adjust instantaneously to the post-shock value $T_2$, while the vibrational temperature, $T_v$, relaxes from its upstream value over a finite distance.\n\nThe evolution of the specific vibrational energy, $e_v$, is governed by the steady-state energy-source equation:\n$$\n\\frac{d}{dx}(\\rho u e_v) = \\omega_v\n$$\nwhere $\\rho$ is the gas density, $u$ is the flow velocity, and $\\omega_v$ is the vibrational energy source term given by the Landau-Teller model:\n$$\n\\omega_v = \\rho \\frac{e_{v,eq}(T) - e_v(T_v)}{\\tau_v}\n$$\nHere, $e_v(T_v)$ is the specific vibrational energy at the vibrational temperature $T_v$, $e_{v,eq}(T)$ is the specific vibrational energy that would exist if it were in equilibrium with the local translational-rotational temperature $T$, and $\\tau_v$ is the vibrational relaxation time.\n\nFor this weak shock problem, make the following simplifying assumptions for the relaxation zone ($x  0$):\n1.
