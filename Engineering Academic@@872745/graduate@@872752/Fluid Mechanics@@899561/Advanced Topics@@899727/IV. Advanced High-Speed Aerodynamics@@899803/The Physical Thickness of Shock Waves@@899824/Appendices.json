The fluid's behavior is described by a power-law model. In a reference frame where the shock is stationary, the upstream (pre-shock) state is characterized by density $\\rho_1$ and supersonic velocity $u_1$. The downstream (post-shock) state has a subsonic velocity $u_2$.\n\nWithin the shock layer, the balance between convective momentum transport and viscous stress can be modeled. For an ideal gas medium, this balance simplifies, relating the longitudinal viscous stress $\\tau_{xx}$ to the local fluid velocity $u$ via the equation:\n$$\n\\tau_{xx} = \\rho_1 (u-u_1)(u-u_2)\n$$\nThis relation is a consequence of the Rankine-Hugoniot relations applied locally within the shock structure.
