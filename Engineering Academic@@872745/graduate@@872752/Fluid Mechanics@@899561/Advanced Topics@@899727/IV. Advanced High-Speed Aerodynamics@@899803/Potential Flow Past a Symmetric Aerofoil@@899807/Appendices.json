The aerofoil is at a small angle of attack $\\alpha$ to the freestream. The shape of the aerofoil's upper and lower surfaces are given by $y_s(x) = \\pm y_t(x)$, where the half-thickness distribution is a parabolic profile given by:\n$$y_t(x) = 4h \\left(\\frac{x}{c}\\right) \\left(1-\\frac{x}{c}\\right)$$\nHere, $h$ is the maximum half-thickness, and it is assumed that $h \\ll c$ and $\\alpha$ is small.\n\nWithin the framework of linearized potential flow theory (thin aerofoil theory), the flow is modeled by placing singularities (sources and vortices) on the chord line ($y=0$, for $0 \\le x \\le c$). The horizontal perturbation velocity, $u(x)$, on the upper surface of the aerofoil is the sum of a component due to the aerofoil's thickness, $u_q(x)$, and a component due to its lifting properties (angle of attack), $u_\\gamma(x)$.\n\nThe perturbation velocity due to thickness is given by the Cauchy Principal Value integral:\n$$u_q(x) = \\frac{1}{2\\pi} \\int_0^c \\frac{q(\\xi)}{x-\\xi} d\\xi$$\nwhere the source strength distribution is related to the aerofoil shape by $q(x) = 2U_\\infty \\frac{dy_t}{dx}$.\n\nThe perturbation velocity due to lift on the upper surface is given by $u_\\gamma(x) = \\frac{\\gamma(x)}{2}$, where $\\gamma(x)$ is the vortex sheet strength.
