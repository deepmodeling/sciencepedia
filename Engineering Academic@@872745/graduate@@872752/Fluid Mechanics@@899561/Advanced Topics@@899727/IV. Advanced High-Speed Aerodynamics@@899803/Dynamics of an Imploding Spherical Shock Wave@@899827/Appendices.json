This shock wave is described by the Guderley self-similar solution. At a particular instant, just as the shock front reaches a radius $R_c$, its velocity is $U_{Gud}$.\n\nThis shock front encounters a spherical contact discontinuity at $r = R_c$. The region $r  R_c$ is filled with a different ideal gas (Gas 2) with initial density $\\rho_{02}$ and adiabatic index $\\gamma_2$. The two gases are initially at rest and in pressure equilibrium, with a pressure $p_0$ that is negligible compared to the pressures generated by the shock.\n\nThe physical properties of the two gases ($\\rho_{01}, \\gamma_1, \\rho_{02}, \\gamma_2$) have been meticulously chosen to satisfy a specific impedance matching condition: when the incident Guderley shock strikes the contact discontinuity, no wave (neither a shock nor a rarefaction wave) is reflected back into Gas 1. As a result, a single shock wave is transmitted into Gas 2.\n\nFor a strong shock propagating with velocity $U_s$ into a stationary ideal gas with adiabatic index $\\gamma$ and initial density $\\rho_0$, the Rankine-Hugoniot relations yield the post-shock fluid velocity $u$ and pressure $p$:\n$$u = \\frac{2}{\\gamma+1} U_s$$\n$$p = \\frac{2}{\\gamma+1} \\rho_0 U_s^2$$\n\nAssuming the interaction occurs over a timescale where the curvature of the shock fronts can be neglected, derive an expression for the initial velocity of the transmitted shock, $U_T$, in terms of the incident Guderley shock velocity $U_{Gud}$ and the adiabatic indices $\\gamma_1$ and $\\gamma_2$.", "solution": "Let's denote the initial state of Gas 1 as $(p_0, \\rho_{01})$ and Gas 2 as $(p_0, \\rho_{02})$. The problem states that the initial pressure $p_0$ is negligible, which is consistent with the strong shock approximation. The gases are initially at rest, so their velocity $u_0 = 0$.\n\nFirst, consider the state of Gas 1 immediately behind the incident Guderley shock, just before it interacts with the contact discontinuity. Let's call this Region 1. The shock moves with velocity $U_{Gud}$ into stationary Gas 1. Using the given strong shock relations with $\\gamma = \\gamma_1$ and $\\rho_0 = \\rho_{01}$:\n\nThe fluid velocity in Region 1 is:\n$$u_1 = \\frac{2}{\\gamma_1+1} U_{Gud}$$\n\nThe pressure in Region 1 is:\n$$p_1 = \\frac{2}{\\gamma_1+1} \\rho_{01} U_{Gud}^2$$\n\nNext, we analyze the interaction at the contact discontinuity at $r=R_c$. The problem's central condition is that no wave is reflected back into Gas 1. This implies that the state of Gas 1 on the upstream side of the contact discontinuity remains $(u_1, p_1)$ as the interaction proceeds. The flow is undisturbed behind the transmitted shock's point of origin.\n\nA contact discontinuity is a boundary across which the normal velocity and pressure must be continuous. Let the transmitted shock moving into Gas 2 create a state (Region 2) with fluid velocity $u_2$ and pressure $p_2$. The contact discontinuity itself will move with the local fluid velocity. For continuity across the moving contact discontinuity, we must have:\n$$u_2 = u_1$$\n$$p_2 = p_1$$\n\nNow, consider the transmitted shock. It propagates into Gas 2, which is stationary ($u_0=0$) and has properties $\\gamma_2$ and $\\rho_{02}$. Let the velocity of this transmitted shock be $U_T$.
