While we typically associate this with heating from below, this thought experiment challenges that simple notion by considering a fluid with a negative coefficient of thermal expansion. This practice forces a return to first principles to determine the conditions that truly lead to gravitational instability, moving beyond rote memorization to a deeper conceptual understanding. [@problem_id:1784701]", "problem": "In the study of fluid dynamics, Rayleigh-Bénard convection describes the phenomenon where a fluid, when heated from below, develops a characteristic pattern of convection cells. This process is fundamentally driven by a density gradient established by a temperature gradient in the presence of a gravitational field.\n\nConsider a thin, horizontal layer of a special incompressible fluid confined between two large, parallel plates separated by a small distance. The fluid is subject to a uniform gravitational field pointing vertically downward. The coefficient of volume thermal expansion, $\\alpha$, is defined by the relation $\\rho \\approx \\rho_0 [1 - \\alpha(T - T_0)]$, where $\\rho$ is the fluid density at temperature $T$, and $\\rho_0$ is the reference density at a reference temperature $T_0$. For most common fluids, $\\alpha$ is positive, meaning they become less dense when heated.\n\nHowever, the specific fluid in this problem exhibits an anomalous behavior: its coefficient of volume thermal expansion $\\alpha$ is a negative constant over the entire range of temperatures considered.\n\nTo induce Rayleigh-Bénard convection in this specific fluid layer, which of the following heating configurations is required?\n\nA. The bottom plate must be maintained at a higher temperature than the top plate. This is because heating a fluid always decreases its density, causing it to rise.\n\nB. The top plate must be maintained at a higher temperature than the bottom plate. This is because denser fluid must be situated above less dense fluid for a gravitational instability to occur.\n\nC. It is impossible to induce convection in such a fluid, as a negative coefficient of thermal expansion inherently stabilizes the fluid against temperature gradients.\n\nD. The bottom plate must be maintained at a higher temperature than the top plate, but only if the gravitational field is sufficiently weak.\n\nE.
