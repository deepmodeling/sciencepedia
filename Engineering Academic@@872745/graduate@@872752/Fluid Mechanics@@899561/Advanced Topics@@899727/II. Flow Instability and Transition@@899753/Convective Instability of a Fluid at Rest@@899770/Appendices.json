When the temperature difference $\\Delta T = T_0 - T_1$ is sufficiently large, the quiescent state becomes unstable and convection begins. This phenomenon is known as Darcy-Bénard convection.\n\nWithin the Boussinesq approximation, the state of marginal stability (the onset of convection) for disturbances of the form $f(z)e^{i(k_x x + k_y y)}$ is described by the following system of linear, non-dimensionalized ordinary differential equations for the amplitude of the vertical velocity, $W(z)$, and the temperature perturbation, $\\Theta(z)$:\n$$\n\\left(\\frac{d^2}{dz^2} - a^2\\right) \\Theta(z) = -W(z)\n$$\n$$\n\\left(\\frac{d^2}{dz^2} - a^2\\right) W(z) = -Ra_D \\, a^2 \\, \\Theta(z)\n$$\nHere, $z \\in [0, 1]$ is the dimensionless vertical coordinate, $a$ is the dimensionless horizontal wavenumber of the disturbance, and $Ra_D$ is the Darcy-Rayleigh number, defined as:\n$$\nRa_D = \\frac{g \\alpha (\\Delta T) K d}{\\nu \\kappa_m}\n$$\nwhere $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity, $\\alpha$ is the thermal expansion coefficient, $K$ is the permeability of the porous medium, $\\nu$ is the kinematic viscosity of the fluid, and $\\kappa_m$ is the effective thermal diffusivity of the saturated medium.\n\nThe boundary conditions are as follows:\n1.

Under the Oberbeck–Boussinesq approximation, the conduction state has a linear temperature profile and stationary fluid. Consider the linear stability of this conduction state with respect to infinitesimal normal modes of horizontal wavenumber $k$ and growth rate $\\sigma$. The plates are impermeable and the velocity satisfies the same mechanical boundary conditions at both plates (either both no-slip or both stress-free). The thermal boundary condition at each plate is either isothermal (Dirichlet) or isoflux (Neumann).

Neumann thermal conditions replace the perturbation temperature Dirichlet condition by a homogeneous normal-derivative condition, which admits a vertically uniform thermal eigenfunction.

Neumann thermal conditions lead to exactly the same linear eigenvalue problem as Dirichlet conditions after linearization about the conduction state, so both $Ra_c$ and $k_c$ are unchanged.\n\nC. Neumann thermal conditions increase both $k_c$ and $Ra_c$ relative to isothermal conditions, because fixing the heat flux makes the boundaries thermally more restrictive and thereby stabilizes short waves.\n\nD. Neumann thermal conditions change the temperature boundary condition to a homogeneous normal-derivative condition and make convection easier to trigger (lower $Ra_c$), but the minimum of the neutral curve shifts to shorter horizontal wavelengths (larger $k_c$) than in the isothermal case.", "solution": "We begin from the Oberbeck–Boussinesq equations for an incompressible fluid under gravity $g \\,\\hat{\\boldsymbol{z}}$, written in dimensional form for velocity $\\boldsymbol{u}$, pressure $p$, temperature $T$, kinematic viscosity $\\nu$, thermal diffusivity $\\kappa$, and thermal expansion coefficient $\\alpha$:\n$$\n\\nabla \\cdot \\boldsymbol{u} = 0, \\quad\n\\rho_0 \\left( \\frac{\\partial \\boldsymbol{u}}{\\partial t} + \\boldsymbol{u}\\cdot \\nabla \\boldsymbol{u} \\right) = -\\nabla p + \\mu \\nabla^2 \\boldsymbol{u} + \\rho_0 g \\alpha (T-T_\\mathrm{ref}) \\,\\hat{\\boldsymbol{z}},\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial t} + \\boldsymbol{u}\\cdot \\nabla T = \\kappa \\nabla^2 T.\n$$\nIn the conduction base state, $\\boldsymbol{u}_0=\\boldsymbol{0}$ and $T_0(z)$ is linear: $T_0(z)=T_b - \\beta z$ with constant gradient $\\beta0$ set by the imposed thermal boundary conditions.

Neutral stability corresponds to $\\Re(\\sigma)=0$, and in particular to stationary onset, $\\sigma=0$, in classical Rayleigh–Bénard convection.\n\nThe mechanical boundary conditions at $z=0$ and $z=1$ are imposed as either no-slip ($W=DW=0$) or stress-free ($W=D^2 W=0$). The thermal boundary conditions for the perturbation depend on whether the plates are isothermal or isoflux. For isothermal plates, the total temperature is fixed at the plate, so the perturbation must vanish: $\\Theta=0$. For isoflux plates, the normal heat flux is fixed; the base state already satisfies the specified constant flux, and the linear perturbation must not change it, so the normal derivative of the perturbation temperature must vanish: $D\\Theta=0$.\n\nThus, the eigenvalue problem is modified by replacing the Dirichlet condition $\\Theta=0$ at $z=0,1$ with the homogeneous Neumann condition $D\\Theta=0$ at $z=0,1$, while keeping the same velocity boundary conditions for $W$.\n\nThis change has two key consequences for the spectrum:\n\n- Vertical thermal eigenfunctions: Under Dirichlet conditions, the vertical Laplacian eigenfunctions for $\\Theta$ exclude a vertically uniform mode; the smallest admissible vertical wavenumber is of order $\\pi$ (for stress-free velocity the associated $W$ typically aligns with $\\sin(n\\pi z)$, with $n\\ge 1$). Under Neumann conditions, a vertically uniform thermal mode is admissible ($\\Theta$ constant in $z$, i.e., vertical wavenumber $n=0$), consistent with $D\\Theta=0$ at $z=0,1$. This reduces the effective total squared wavenumber in the thermal diffusion operator from $k^2 + n^2 \\pi^2$ (with $n\\ge 1$) to $k^2 + n^2 \\pi^2$ with $n$ allowed to be $0$.\n\n- Long-wave tendency: Because thermal diffusion enters as a stabilizing term $\\left(D^2 - k^2\\right)\\Theta$ and the coupling to buoyancy scales with $Ra$, allowing $n=0$ removes the lowest vertical diffusion penalty on $\\Theta$. Minimization of the neutral stability condition with respect to $k$ therefore shifts toward smaller $k$, and in the stress-free case reaches the endpoint $k_c \\to 0$ (a long-wave critical mode). In the no-slip case, viscous constraints on $W$ still enforce a finite vertical shear, so $k_c$ remains finite but is smaller than in the isothermal case.\n\nA complementary energy-based view corroborates this. At stationary onset ($\\sigma=0$) the linear temperature equation gives, after multiplying by $\\Theta$ and integrating over $z \\in [0,1]$,\n$$\n\\int_0^1 |\\nabla \\Theta|^2 \\, dz - \\left[ \\Theta \\, D\\Theta \\right]_{z=0}^{z=1} + \\int_0^1 W \\Theta \\, dz = 0.\n$$\nUnder Dirichlet conditions, $\\Theta=0$ at the boundaries, so the boundary term vanishes and the smallest admissible bulk diffusion penalty is set by the lowest nontrivial vertical mode ($n\\ge 1$). Under Neumann conditions, $D\\Theta=0$ at the boundaries, the boundary term also vanishes, but now the admissible space for $\\Theta$ includes the vertically uniform mode, which minimizes $\\int_0^1 |\\nabla \\Theta|^2 \\, dz$ subject to coupling to $W$. This again shows a reduced stabilizing diffusion contribution, favoring longer horizontal wavelengths and lowering the threshold.\n\nTaken together, replacing isothermal with isoflux thermal boundary conditions:\n\n- Modifies the eigenvalue problem by imposing $D\\Theta=0$ at the plates instead of $\\Theta=0$.\n- Lowers $Ra_c$ relative to the isothermal case for the same mechanical boundary conditions (convection is more easily triggered).\n- Shifts the most unstable horizontal scale to larger planform size (smaller $k_c$); in the stress-free case the minimum occurs at $k_c \\to 0$, whereas in the no-slip case $k_c$ remains finite but is smaller than with isothermal boundaries.\n\nWe now evaluate the options.\n\nOption A: This states that Neumann conditions replace Dirichlet for $\\Theta$, admit a vertically uniform thermal mode, shift the neutral curve toward long waves with $k_c$ decreased (with $k_c \\to 0$ for stress-free plates), and lower $Ra_c$ compared with isothermal for the same velocity boundary conditions. This matches the analysis above: the eigenvalue problem indeed changes $\\Theta$ boundary conditions to $D\\Theta=0$, the admissible $n=0$ thermal mode promotes long waves, and the diffusion penalty is reduced, lowering $Ra_c$. Verdict: Correct.\n\nOption B: This claims no change in the eigenvalue problem and no change in $Ra_c$ or $k_c$. This is incorrect because the thermal boundary conditions explicitly change from $\\Theta=0$ to $D\\Theta=0$, which alters the admissible eigenfunctions and the neutral curves.\n\nOption C: This claims increases in both $k_c$ and $Ra_c$ due to “more restrictive” boundaries. Physically and mathematically, the fixed-flux boundary is not more restrictive in the sense of damping temperature perturbations; it allows nonzero $\\Theta$ at the walls and admits the $n=0$ mode, which reduces the stabilizing effect of thermal diffusion. Empirically and by the reasoning above, $Ra_c$ decreases and $k_c$ decreases. Verdict: Incorrect.\n\nOption D: This claims the correct modification of the boundary condition and a decrease in $Ra_c$ but asserts that the neutral minimum shifts to shorter waves (larger $k_c$). This contradicts the presence of the admissible $n=0$ thermal mode and the long-wave tendency documented above.

Since the integrand is symmetric in $k,n$, we have $C_{12}=C_{21}$.\n$C_{12} = 2 \\int_0^1 \\beta(\\zeta) \\sin(\\pi\\zeta)\\sin(2\\pi\\zeta) \\,d\\zeta = \\int_0^{1/2} \\sin(\\pi\\zeta)\\sin(2\\pi\\zeta) \\,d\\zeta - \\int_{1/2}^1 \\sin(\\pi\\zeta)\\sin(2\\pi\\zeta) \\,d\\zeta$.\nUsing the identity $\\sin A \\sin B = \\frac{1}{2}(\\cos(A-B)-\\cos(A+B))$:\n$\\sin(\\pi\\zeta)\\sin(2\\pi\\zeta) = \\frac{1}{2}(\\cos(\\pi\\zeta)-\\cos(3\\pi\\zeta))$.\n$\\int_0^{1/2} \\frac{1}{2}(\\cos(\\pi\\zeta)-\\cos(3\\pi\\zeta)) \\,d\\zeta = \\frac{1}{2}\\left[\\frac{\\sin(\\pi\\zeta)}{\\pi}-\\frac{\\sin(3\\pi\\zeta)}{3\\pi}\\right]_0^{1/2} = \\frac{1}{2}\\left[\\left(\\frac{1}{\\pi}-\\frac{-1}{3\\pi}\\right)-0\\right] = \\frac{1}{2}\\frac{4}{3\\pi} = \\frac{2}{3\\pi}$.\n$\\int_{1/2}^1 \\frac{1}{2}(\\cos(\\pi\\zeta)-\\cos(3\\pi\\zeta)) \\,d\\zeta = \\frac{1}{2}\\left[\\frac{\\sin(\\pi\\zeta)}{\\pi}-\\frac{\\sin(3\\pi\\zeta)}{3\\pi}\\right]_{1/2}^1 = \\frac{1}{2}\\left[0-\\left(\\frac{1}{\\pi}-\\frac{-1}{3\\pi}\\right)\\right] = -\\frac{2}{3\\pi}$.\nSo, $C_{12} = \\frac{2}{3\\pi} - (-\\frac{2}{3\\pi}) = \\frac{4}{3\\pi}$.\n\n**4. Solving for the Rayleigh Number**\n\nThe system of equations for $B_1, B_2$ becomes:\n$$ B_1(\\pi^2+a^2) = A_2 C_{12} $$\n$$ B_2((2\\pi)^2+a^2) = A_1 C_{21} $$\nNow we combine these with the relations from the first projected equation:\n$A_1(\\pi^2+a^2)^2 = R a^2 B_1 = R a^2 \\frac{A_2 C_{12}}{\\pi^2+a^2}$\n$A_2((2\\pi)^2+a^2)^2 = R a^2 B_2 = R a^2 \\frac{A_1 C_{21}}{(2\\pi)^2+a^2}$\nThis gives the linear system for $(A_1, A_2)$:\n$$ A_1(\\pi^2+a^2)^3 - (R a^2 C_{12}) A_2 = 0 $$\n$$ -(R a^2 C_{21}) A_1 + A_2((2\\pi)^2+a^2)^3 = 0 $$\nFor a non-trivial solution $(A_1, A_2)$, the determinant of the coefficient matrix must be zero:\n$$ (\\pi^2+a^2)^3 ((2\\pi)^2+a^2)^3 - (R a^2)^2 C_{12} C_{21} = 0 $$\nSince $C_{12} = C_{21} = 4/(3\\pi)$, we have $C_{12}C_{21}=(4/(3\\pi))^2$.\n$$ (R a^2)^2 \\left(\\frac{4}{3\\pi}\\right)^2 = ((\\pi^2+a^2)(4\\pi^2+a^2))^3 $$\nTaking the positive square root (since $R$ must be positive for this instability):\n$$ R a^2 \\frac{4}{3\\pi} = ((\\pi^2+a^2)(4\\pi^2+a^2))^{3/2} $$\n$$ R(a) = \\frac{3\\pi}{4a^2} ((\\pi^2+a^2)(4\\pi^2+a^2))^{3/2} $$\n\n**5.
