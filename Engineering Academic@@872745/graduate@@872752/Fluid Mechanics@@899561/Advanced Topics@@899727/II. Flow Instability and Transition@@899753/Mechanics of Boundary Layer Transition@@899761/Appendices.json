Primes denote differentiation with respect to $y$. The flow is unstable if the imaginary part of the wave speed, $c_i$, is positive. A necessary condition for inviscid instability is Rayleigh's inflection point criterion, which states that $U''(y)$ must be zero for some $y$ in the flow domain.\n\nConsider the family of Falkner-Skan boundary layer profiles, which are similarity solutions described by the pressure gradient parameter $\\beta$. For this family of flows, an inflection point exists only for adverse pressure gradients, i.e., $\\beta  0$.

This exercise investigates this \"bypass\" transition pathway by modeling the flow near the leading edge of a blunt body, where the \"lift-up effect\" can cause certain disturbances to amplify their energy dramatically over short times. Your task is to perform a scaling analysis to determine how the maximum possible energy amplification scales with the governing Reynolds number, providing crucial insight into receptivity and transition in practical engineering applications [@problem_id:564972].", "problem": "In the study of hydrodynamic stability, the classical eigenvalue analysis (e.g., Orr-Sommerfeld theory) predicts the asymptotic fate of small disturbances. However, for many shear flows, disturbances can experience significant transient energy amplification over short time scales, even if all eigenmodes are stable. This phenomenon, known as transient growth, is a key mechanism in the bypass transition to turbulence.\n\nThe energy amplification factor is defined as $G(t) = E(t)/E(0)$, where $E(t)$ is the kinetic energy of a disturbance field at time $t$. The maximum possible amplification for a given flow is $G_{max} = \\max_{\\phi_0} \\max_{t>0} G(t)$, where the maximization is over all possible initial disturbances $\\phi_0$ with initial energy $E(0)$. It is known that $G_{max}$ often follows a scaling law of the form $G_{max} \\propto Re^k$ for some characteristic Reynolds number $Re$.\n\nConsider a two-dimensional, incompressible, steady boundary layer flow near the stagnation point of a blunt body with a nose radius of curvature $R_n$. This flow can be modeled by the Hiemenz similarity solution. The key features of this base flow are:\n1.  The velocity at the edge of the boundary layer is $U_e(x) = Kx$, where $x$ is the distance along the surface from the stagnation point and $K$ is a constant velocity gradient.\n2.  The characteristic thickness of the boundary layer, $\\delta$, is constant and scales as $\\delta \\sim \\sqrt{\\nu/K}$, where $\\nu$ is the kinematic viscosity of the fluid.\n\nThe dominant mechanism for transient growth in such a boundary layer is the \"lift-up effect,\" where initial streamwise vortices generate elongated, high-amplitude streamwise velocity structures called streaks.
