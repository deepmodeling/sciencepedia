We assume that $c_1 > c_2$, a condition that allows for the existence of a lateral wave (or head wave).\n\nFor a point source and a receiver both located in the slower medium (medium 2), a wave can travel from the source to the interface, propagate along the interface in the faster medium (medium 1), and then radiate back into the slower medium to the receiver.
