This exercise solidifies the application of the basic logarithmic profile in a canonical setting.", "problem": "Consider a fully developed, incompressible, turbulent plane Couette flow between two infinite parallel plates separated by a distance $h$. The bottom plate at $y=0$ is stationary, while the top plate at $y=h$ moves with a constant velocity $U_w$ in the x-direction. The flow is driven solely by the motion of the top plate, with no imposed pressure gradient. The fluid has density $\\rho$ and kinematic viscosity $\\nu$.\n\nIn the turbulent regime at high Reynolds numbers, a logarithmic velocity profile is observed near the walls. This \"law of the wall\" is given by:\n$$ u^+ = \\frac{1}{\\kappa} \\ln(y^+) + B $$\nwhere $u^+ = u/u_\\tau$ is the dimensionless velocity, $y^+ = y u_\\tau / \\nu$ is the dimensionless distance from the wall, and $u_\\tau = \\sqrt{\\tau_w/\\rho}$ is the friction velocity, with $\\tau_w$ being the spatially constant wall shear stress. $\\kappa$ is the von Kármán constant and $B$ is a dimensionless constant.\n\nAssume that:\n1. The law of the wall holds in the regions near both the stationary and the moving plates. For the region near the moving plate, the velocity relative to the plate, $U_w - u(y)$, and the distance from that plate, $h-y$, should be used.\n2. The velocity profile is symmetric in the sense that the velocity at the centerline, $y=h/2$, is exactly half the velocity of the moving plate, i.e., $u(h/2) = U_w/2$.\n\nThe relationship between the skin friction coefficient, $C_f = \\frac{\\tau_w}{\\frac{1}{2}\\rho U_w^2}$, and the Reynolds number, $Re = \\frac{U_w h}{\\nu}$, can be expressed by an implicit equation. It can be shown that this equation can be arranged into the form:\n$$ \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{C_f}} = A \\ln(Re \\sqrt{C_f}) + D $$\nwhere $A$ and $D$ are constants that depend on $\\kappa$ and $B$.\n\nYour task is to derive an expression for the constant $D$ in terms of $\\kappa$, $B$, and fundamental mathematical constants.", "solution": "The derivation begins by applying the law of the wall and the symmetry condition to find an implicit relation for the flow parameters. This relation is then manipulated into the target form to identify the constant $D$.\n\nFirst, we write the law of the wall for the velocity profile near the bottom stationary plate ($y=0$):\n$$ \\frac{u(y)}{u_\\tau} = \\frac{1}{\\kappa} \\ln\\left(\\frac{y u_\\tau}{\\nu}\\right) + B $$\nwhere $u_\\tau = \\sqrt{\\tau_w/\\rho}$ is the friction velocity, which is constant across the flow.\n\nNext, we apply the symmetry condition given in the problem statement: at the centerline $y=h/2$, the velocity is $u(h/2) = U_w/2$. Substituting these values into the law of the wall equation yields:\n$$ \\frac{U_w/2}{u_\\tau} = \\frac{1}{\\kappa} \\ln\\left(\\frac{(h/2) u_\\tau}{\\nu}\\right) + B $$\nThis can be simplified to:\n$$ \\frac{U_w}{2u_\\tau} = \\frac{1}{\\kappa} \\ln\\left(\\frac{h u_\\tau}{2\\nu}\\right) + B $$\nThis equation implicitly relates the wall velocity $U_w$ and the friction velocity $u_\\tau$. (Note: Applying the law of the wall from the top plate with the symmetry condition would yield the same equation, showing consistency.)\n\nThe next step is to express this relation in terms of the skin friction coefficient $C_f$ and the Reynolds number $Re$. The definitions are:\n$$ C_f = \\frac{\\tau_w}{\\frac{1}{2}\\rho U_w^2} = \\frac{\\rho u_\\tau^2}{\\frac{1}{2}\\rho U_w^2} = 2\\left(\\frac{u_\\tau}{U_w}\\right)^2 \\implies \\frac{U_w}{u_\\tau} = \\sqrt{\\frac{2}{C_f}} $$\n$$ Re = \\frac{U_w h}{\\nu} $$\n\nSubstitute these definitions into our implicit relation.
