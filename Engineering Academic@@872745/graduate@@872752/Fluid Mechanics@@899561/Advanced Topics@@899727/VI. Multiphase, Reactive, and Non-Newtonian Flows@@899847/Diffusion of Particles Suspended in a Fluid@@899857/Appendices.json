This practice explores a canonical problem where particle diffusion is balanced by a constant drift (convection) and a first-order reaction at a boundary.

The particles also exhibit random thermal motion, which is characterized by a diffusion coefficient $D$.\n\nThe particles can be absorbed at the surface $x=0$ through a first-order chemical reaction. The number of particles reacting per unit area per unit time is given by $k C(0)$, where $k$ is the reaction rate constant (with units of velocity) and $C(x)$ is the particle concentration at position $x$.

The transition from the right-moving state to the left-moving state occurs with a constant rate $k_{RL}$.
