## Introduction
Multiphase flows, where distinct phases like gas, liquid, and solid flow together, are ubiquitous in nature and industry. From steam generators in power plants to bubbly flows in bioreactors and sprays in internal [combustion](@entry_id:146700) engines, their behavior governs the efficiency, safety, and performance of countless processes. However, the inherent complexity arising from the dynamic interfaces between phases makes their direct simulation intractable. The central challenge lies in developing mathematical models that can capture the essential physics of [interphase](@entry_id:157879) exchange of mass, momentum, and energy in a computationally feasible manner. This article addresses this knowledge gap by providing a structured overview of the principal mixing models used to analyze multiphase systems.

Finally, the "Hands-On Practices" section offers a chance to engage directly with the core concepts through guided problem-solving, solidifying your understanding of these powerful analytical tools.

## Principles and Mechanisms

The analysis of multiphase flows necessitates the development of mathematical models that can capture the complex interactions between different phases. These models are constructed upon fundamental principles of mechanics and thermodynamics, but they invariably involve averaging procedures and closure relations to become computationally tractable. This chapter delves into the core principles and mechanisms that underpin modern [multiphase flow](@entry_id:146480) modeling, progressing from simplified mixture concepts to comprehensive multi-fluid frameworks and the intricate closure laws they require.

### Macroscopic Mixture Models: From Homogeneous Flow to Drift-Flux

The most straightforward approach to modeling a multiphase mixture is to treat it as a single "pseudo-fluid" with effective properties derived from its constituents. This is the central idea of the **Homogeneous Equilibrium Model (HEM)**. In this model, all phases are assumed to be in perfect thermal and [mechanical equilibrium](@entry_id:148830), meaning they share the same temperature, pressure, and, most critically, the same velocity. The mixture's properties, such as density and enthalpy, are typically defined as mass- or volume-weighted averages of the individual phase properties.

Despite its simplicity, the HEM can provide valuable insights, particularly for flows where the phases are well-mixed and move in unison. A key illustration of its application arises when considering the thermodynamic behavior of a two-phase mixture, such as steam and water, undergoing a [throttling process](@entry_id:146484). The temperature change with pressure during a constant-enthalpy expansion is described by the Joule-Thomson coefficient, $\mu_{JT} = (\partial T / \partial P)_h$. For a single-phase fluid, this coefficient depends on the fluid's [equation of state](@entry_id:141675). However, for a two-phase mixture under the HEM assumptions, the situation simplifies remarkably. Within the [saturation dome](@entry_id:140414), the temperature is solely a function of pressure, $T = T_{sat}(P)$. Consequently, the partial derivative becomes a [total derivative](@entry_id:137587), $\mu_{JT,mix} = dT_{sat}/dP$. This derivative is precisely described by the Clausius-Clapeyron equation, which relates the slope of the saturation curve to the latent heat of vaporization ($h_{fg}$) and the [specific volume](@entry_id:136431) change upon vaporization ($v_{fg}$). This leads to the elegant result that the Joule-Thomson coefficient for the mixture is not a function of the quality (vapor mass fraction) but is determined entirely by the thermodynamic properties at the given saturation state [@problem_id:570499]:
$$
\mu_{JT,mix} = \frac{T_{sat} v_{fg}}{h_{fg}}
$$
This demonstrates how, under equilibrium assumptions, the complex behavior of a two-phase mixture can be described by fundamental [thermodynamic relations](@entry_id:139032), treating the mixture as a single entity.

While the HEM is useful, its core assumption of zero relative velocity (no-slip) between phases is often too restrictive. A significant improvement is offered by the **Drift-Flux Model**, which retains the concept of a single mixture [momentum equation](@entry_id:197225) but allows for relative motion. This framework is particularly powerful for [separated flows](@entry_id:754694) like bubbly or [slug flow](@entry_id:151327). The key is to distinguish between different mixture velocities. The **center-of-volume velocity**, or **mixture volumetric flux** ($j$), is the total volume passing through a unit area per unit time, defined as $j = \alpha_g u_g + \alpha_l u_l$ for a gas-liquid flow. In contrast, the **center-of-mass velocity** ($u_m$) describes the motion of the mixture's center of mass and is defined by the total momentum flux: $u_m = (\alpha_g \rho_g u_g + \alpha_l \rho_l u_l) / \rho_m$, where $\rho_m = \alpha_g \rho_g + \alpha_l \rho_l$ is the mixture density.

These two velocities are not identical when the phases have different densities and velocities. The difference between them is directly related to the **drift velocity**, which quantifies the relative motion. For instance, the gas drift velocity, $u_{gj} = u_g - j$, represents the velocity of the gas phase relative to a plane moving at the center-of-volume velocity. A fundamental derivation shows that the difference between the center-of-mass and center-of-volume velocities can be expressed concisely in terms of this drift velocity [@problem_id:570558]:
$$
u_m - j = \frac{\alpha_g(\rho_g - \rho_l)}{\rho_m} u_{gj}
$$
This relationship is crucial: it reveals that the transport of momentum (represented by $u_m$) and the transport of volume (represented by $j$) are different processes whenever there is slip ($u_{gj} \neq 0$) and a [density contrast](@entry_id:157948) ($\rho_g \neq \rho_l$). The drift-flux model exploits this by solving a single [momentum equation](@entry_id:197225) for the mixture (using $u_m$) while using a separate [algebraic closure](@entry_id:151964) law to relate the drift velocity to local flow parameters, thus capturing the essential physics of slip without the complexity of a full two-fluid model.

### Averaging Techniques for Variable-Density and Turbulent Flows

To derive macroscopic governing equations for multiphase or turbulent flows, where properties fluctuate rapidly in time and space, we must employ an averaging procedure. The traditional method is **Reynolds averaging**, where any flow variable $\phi$ is decomposed into a time-averaged mean $\overline{\phi}$ and a fluctuation $\phi'$, such that $\phi = \overline{\phi} + \phi'$. While effective for constant-density flows, this approach becomes cumbersome when density $\rho$ also fluctuates, as is typical in multiphase systems or compressible turbulence. The averaged continuity and momentum equations contain terms like $\overline{\rho' \mathbf{u}'}$, which complicate the formulation.

To simplify the equations for variable-density flows, **Favre averaging**, or mass-weighted averaging, is introduced. The Favre average of a quantity $\phi$ is defined as $\widetilde{\phi} = \overline{\rho \phi} / \overline{\rho}$. A variable is then decomposed as $\phi = \widetilde{\phi} + \phi''$, where $\phi''$ is the Favre fluctuation. The key advantage of this method is that the density-weighted average of the fluctuation is zero by definition: $\overline{\rho \phi''} = 0$. This property elegantly simplifies the averaged governing equations. For example, the averaged [continuity equation](@entry_id:145242) becomes $\frac{\partial \overline{\rho}}{\partial t} + \nabla \cdot (\overline{\rho} \widetilde{\mathbf{u}}) = 0$, which has the same form as the instantaneous equation for a [compressible fluid](@entry_id:267520), but in terms of averaged quantities.

Applying Favre averaging to the convective momentum flux term, $\rho u_i u_j$, reveals the origin of the turbulent stress terms in the Favre-averaged framework. By substituting the decomposition $u_i = \widetilde{u}_i + u_i''$ and averaging, we obtain [@problem_id:570526]:
$$
\overline{\rho u_i u_j} = \overline{\rho} \widetilde{u}_i \widetilde{u}_j + \overline{\rho u_i'' u_j''}
$$
The first term on the right-hand side represents the convection of mean momentum by the Favre-averaged flow. The second term, $\mathcal{T}_{ij} = \overline{\rho u_i'' u_j''}$, is the **Favre-averaged Reynolds stress tensor**. This is an unclosed term that represents the transport of momentum by turbulent fluctuations and must be modeled to close the system of equations.

Although Favre fluctuations simplify the governing equations, it is important to understand their relationship to standard Reynolds fluctuations. The simple time average of a Favre fluctuation, $\overline{\phi''}$, is generally not zero. For the velocity field, a direct relationship can be established between the Reynolds and Favre averages. The Reynolds-averaged velocity can be expressed in terms of the Favre-averaged velocity and the turbulent mass flux correlation, $\overline{\rho' u_i'}$. This leads to an expression for the time average of the Favre velocity fluctuation [@problem_id:570554]:
$$
\overline{u_i''} = \overline{u_i} - \widetilde{u_i} = -\frac{\overline{\rho' u_i'}}{\overline{\rho}}
$$
This shows that the difference between the two mean velocities—and thus the mean of the Favre fluctuation—is directly tied to the correlation between density and velocity fluctuations, a quantity that represents the [turbulent transport](@entry_id:150198) of mass.

### The Two-Fluid Model and the Closure Problem

For flows with significant mechanical and thermal non-equilibrium, the most comprehensive approach is the **two-fluid model**. In this framework, each phase is treated as an interpenetrating continuum, and a separate set of averaged conservation equations (mass, momentum, and energy) is solved for each phase. The interaction between the phases is accounted for through **interfacial exchange terms** that appear as sources or sinks in the conservation equations. For a two-phase system, the momentum equation for phase $k$ will take the general form:
$$
\frac{\partial (\alpha_k \rho_k \mathbf{u}_k)}{\partial t} + \nabla \cdot (\alpha_k \rho_k \mathbf{u}_k \mathbf{u}_k) = -\alpha_k \nabla P + \nabla \cdot (\alpha_k \boldsymbol{\tau}_k) + \alpha_k \rho_k \mathbf{g} + \mathbf{M}_k + \Gamma_k \mathbf{u}_{ik}
$$
Here, $\alpha_k$, $\rho_k$, and $\mathbf{u}_k$ are the [volume fraction](@entry_id:756566), density, and velocity of phase $k$. The term $\mathbf{M}_k$ represents the total [interfacial momentum transfer](@entry_id:181476) per unit volume due to forces like drag, lift, and virtual mass. The final term accounts for momentum transferred due to phase change, where $\Gamma_k$ is the mass transfer rate and $\mathbf{u}_{ik}$ is the velocity at the interface.

The central challenge of the two-fluid model is the **[closure problem](@entry_id:160656)**: the interfacial exchange terms, such as $\mathbf{M}_k$, and the turbulent stress terms (like $\overline{\rho u_i'' u_j''}$) are unknown and must be described by [constitutive relations](@entry_id:186508), or **closure laws**. These laws are physically-based models that relate the unknown terms to the resolved, large-scale flow variables. The fidelity of a [two-fluid model](@entry_id:139846) simulation depends almost entirely on the quality of these closure relations.

### Modeling Interfacial Momentum Exchange: Non-Drag Forces

The [interfacial momentum transfer](@entry_id:181476), $\mathbf{M}_k$, is the sum of all forces exerted by one phase on another. While the drag force, which opposes the relative motion between phases, is often dominant, several **non-drag forces** are critical for accurately predicting the behavior of dispersed phases.

A primary example is the **virtual mass force** (or [added mass](@entry_id:267870) force). This force arises because a dispersed element (like a bubble or particle) accelerating through a continuous fluid must also accelerate a certain volume of the surrounding fluid. This added inertia manifests as an extra force on the particle. The magnitude of this effect can be quantified by calculating the kinetic energy of the fluid set in motion by the particle. For the idealized case of a solid sphere of radius $R$ accelerating in an unbounded, inviscid, irrotational fluid of density $\rho_f$, the kinetic energy imparted to the fluid can be calculated via a surface integral of the [velocity potential](@entry_id:262992) over the sphere's surface. Relating this kinetic energy to an effective "virtual mass," $m_{vm}$, through $T = \frac{1}{2} m_{vm} |\vec{U}|^2$, yields the classic result [@problem_id:570566]:
$$
m_{vm} = \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{4}{3} \pi R^3 \rho_f \right)
$$
The virtual mass is equal to half the mass of the fluid displaced by the sphere. The corresponding force is $F_{vm} = -m_{vm} \frac{d}{dt}(\mathbf{u}_d - \mathbf{u}_c)$, proportional to the relative acceleration.

Translating this microscopic concept into the macroscopic two-fluid framework requires careful formulation of the acceleration term to ensure the model is objective (i.e., gives the same physical results regardless of the observer's [inertial reference frame](@entry_id:165094)). A naive formulation might use the difference of the material derivatives of the two phases. However, a physically rigorous derivation shows that the continuous phase acceleration must be evaluated along the [dispersed phase](@entry_id:748551) path. The difference between these two formulations reveals a critical correction term necessary for Galilean invariance [@problem_id:570519]. This correction, $\Delta\mathbf{a} = -(\mathbf{u}_d - \mathbf{u}_c) \cdot \nabla \mathbf{u}_c$, depends on the [relative velocity](@entry_id:178060) and the [velocity gradient](@entry_id:261686) of the continuous phase, highlighting the subtle complexities in [upscaling](@entry_id:756369) from particle-scale physics to continuum-scale models.

Another crucial non-drag force is the **lift force**, which acts perpendicular to the direction of [relative motion](@entry_id:169798). It is particularly important in sheared flows, causing particles or bubbles to migrate across [streamlines](@entry_id:266815). The origin of lift lies in the micro-[hydrodynamics](@entry_id:158871) of the flow around the particle. In a [shear flow](@entry_id:266817), the velocity difference across the particle creates a pressure imbalance. Furthermore, a viscous fluid will exert a torque on the particle. For a torque-free, neutrally buoyant sphere in a low-Reynolds-number linear [shear flow](@entry_id:266817), the sphere will be induced to rotate. The equilibrium angular velocity of the sphere, $\mathbf{\Omega}$, is exactly half of the local fluid [vorticity](@entry_id:142747), $\boldsymbol{\omega} = \nabla \times \mathbf{u}_c$ [@problem_id:570536]:
$$
\mathbf{\Omega} = \frac{1}{2} \boldsymbol{\omega}
$$
This induced rotation, coupled with the [translational motion](@entry_id:187700), is a fundamental mechanism that generates lift forces (such as the Saffman lift) and drives the lateral migration of the [dispersed phase](@entry_id:748551).

### Turbulent and Phase-Change Induced Momentum Transfer

In turbulent flows, averaging the momentum equations introduces new terms that require modeling. The **[turbulent dispersion](@entry_id:197290) force** is a prime example. This is not a fundamental physical force but rather an emergent effect of averaging, describing the tendency of the [dispersed phase](@entry_id:748551) to migrate due to correlations between turbulent velocity fluctuations and volume fraction fluctuations. If one starts with a linear model for the instantaneous drag force and applies Reynolds averaging, the mean drag force contains a term involving the correlation $\overline{\alpha_p' (\mathbf{u}_c' - \mathbf{u}_p')}$. This term represents the [turbulent dispersion](@entry_id:197290) force. By employing a [gradient-diffusion hypothesis](@entry_id:156064) to model the turbulent fluxes (e.g., $\overline{\alpha_p' \mathbf{u}_c'} = -\mathcal{D}_{cp} \nabla \overline{\alpha}_p$), one can derive an explicit expression for this force. The result shows that the force is typically directed up the gradient of the continuous phase [volume fraction](@entry_id:756566), effectively causing particles to diffuse from regions of high particle concentration to low concentration [@problem_id:570488].

Momentum exchange is also intrinsically linked to **[interphase mass transfer](@entry_id:151239)**, such as [evaporation](@entry_id:137264) or condensation. When mass is transferred from a liquid to a vapor phase, it carries momentum with it. This must be accounted for as [source and sink](@entry_id:265703) terms in the respective momentum equations. The velocity of the mass being transferred, $\mathbf{u}^*$, is a key modeling choice. A physically consistent model for $\mathbf{u}^*$ can be derived by enforcing the principle that the model should not artificially create or destroy the kinetic energy of the mean flow. This thermodynamic constraint—requiring the power supplied by the momentum source terms to equal the rate of change of kinetic energy due to mass addition/removal—leads to a specific form for the transfer velocity. For a two-phase system, it dictates that the transferred mass should carry the arithmetic average of the phase velocities [@problem_id:570471]:
$$
\mathbf{u}^* = \frac{1}{2}(\mathbf{u}_v + \mathbf{u}_l)
$$
The momentum [source term](@entry_id:269111) for the vapor phase due to evaporation at a rate $\Gamma_v$ is therefore $\mathbf{S}_v = \Gamma_v \mathbf{u}^* = \Gamma_v \frac{1}{2}(\mathbf{u}_v + \mathbf{u}_l)$.

### Modeling Flow Morphology: Interfacial Area Transport

In many dispersed flows, such as bubbly flows, sprays, and emulsions, the size distribution of the dispersed elements is not static but evolves dynamically through **coalescence** (merging) and **breakage** (splitting). This evolution of the flow's morphology is critical as it directly affects the interfacial area, which in turn governs the rates of interfacial heat, mass, and [momentum transfer](@entry_id:147714).

To model this evolution, one can introduce a [transport equation](@entry_id:174281) for the **interfacial area concentration**, $a_i$ (the total interfacial area per unit volume). This equation takes the form of a conservation law:
$$
\frac{\partial a_i}{\partial t} + \nabla \cdot (\mathbf{u}_i a_i) = S_a
$$
where $\mathbf{u}_i$ is the interfacial velocity and $S_a$ is the net source term due to changes in morphology. The [closure problem](@entry_id:160656) here is to model $S_a = R_C + R_B$, where $R_C$ is the rate of area change from [coalescence](@entry_id:147963) (a sink, so $R_C \lt 0$) and $R_B$ is the rate from breakage (a source, $R_B \gt 0$).

These source terms are constructed by modeling the underlying microscopic events. For instance, in a turbulent [bubbly flow](@entry_id:151342), coalescence can be modeled as a result of random collisions driven by turbulent velocity fluctuations. The rate of collisions depends on the bubble [number density](@entry_id:268986) and their relative velocity, which can be related to the turbulent kinetic energy dissipation rate, $\epsilon$. Breakage can be modeled as a result of bubble impacts with [turbulent eddies](@entry_id:266898) of comparable size. The frequency of breakage events for a given bubble depends on the energy of these eddies. By quantifying the change in surface area for each coalescence and breakage event (e.g., two bubbles of diameter $d$ merging, or one bubble splitting into two smaller ones) and multiplying by the event frequency, one can formulate expressions for $R_C$ and $R_B$. These expressions will depend on local macroscopic flow variables like the [dispersed phase](@entry_id:748551) volume fraction $\alpha_d$, the interfacial area concentration $a_i$, and the turbulence dissipation rate $\epsilon$ [@problem_id:570589]. This approach, known as the **Population Balance Equation (PBE)** method, provides a powerful and mechanistic way to connect the micro-scale physics of particle interaction to the macro-scale evolution of the [multiphase flow](@entry_id:146480).
