The gas film is a ternary mixture consisting of component A, and two other components, B and C, which are non-volatile and are present as a stagnant mixture. The system is maintained at constant temperature $T$ and pressure $P$. You may assume the gas mixture behaves as an ideal gas, and thus the total molar concentration $c$ is constant.\n\nThe molar fluxes $N_i$ and mole fraction gradients $dx_i/dz$ in a one-dimensional ternary system are related by the Maxwell-Stefan equations:\n$$\n\\frac{dx_A}{dz} = \\frac{x_A N_B - x_B N_A}{c D_{AB}} + \\frac{x_A N_C - x_C N_A}{c D_{AC}}\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{dx_B}{dz} = \\frac{x_B N_A - x_A N_B}{c D_{AB}} + \\frac{x_B N_C - x_C N_B}{c D_{BC}}\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{dx_C}{dz} = \\frac{x_C N_A - x_A N_C}{c D_{AC}} + \\frac{x_C N_B - x_B N_C}{c D_{BC}}\n$$\nwhere $z$ is the spatial coordinate perpendicular to the liquid-gas interface, $x_i$ is the mole fraction of species $i$, and $D_{ij}$ is the constant binary diffusion coefficient for the pair $i-j$. The sum of mole fractions is unity: $x_A + x_B + x_C = 1$.\n\nThe coordinate system is defined such that the liquid-gas interface is at $z=0$ and the outer edge of the gas film is at $z=\\delta$. The boundary conditions for the mole fraction of component A are given as $x_A(z=0) = x_{A0}$ and $x_A(z=\\delta) = x_{A\\delta}$.\n\nSince components B and C are stagnant, their molar fluxes are zero: $N_B = 0$ and $N_C = 0$.

We substitute these conditions into the Maxwell-Stefan equations for components B and C.\n\nFor component B:\n$$\n\\frac{dx_B}{dz} = \\frac{x_B N_A - x_A (0)}{c D_{AB}} + \\frac{x_B (0) - x_C (0)}{c D_{BC}} = \\frac{x_B N_A}{c D_{AB}}\n$$\n\nFor component C:\n$$\n\\frac{dx_C}{dz} = \\frac{x_C N_A - x_A (0)}{c D_{AC}} + \\frac{x_C (0) - x_B (0)}{c D_{BC}} = \\frac{x_C N_A}{c D_{AC}}\n$$\n\nNext, we use the experimental observation that the ratio of mole fractions of B and C is constant:\n$$\n\\frac{x_B(z)}{x_C(z)} = \\alpha\n$$\nThis implies $x_B(z) = \\alpha x_C(z)$. We can differentiate this relationship with respect to $z$:\n$$\n\\frac{dx_B}{dz} = \\alpha \\frac{dx_C}{dz}\n$$\nNow, substitute the expressions for the gradients from the Maxwell-Stefan equations:\n$$\n\\frac{x_B N_A}{c D_{AB}} = \\alpha \\left( \\frac{x_C N_A}{c D_{AC}} \\right)\n$$\nSubstitute $x_B = \\alpha x_C$ into the left side:\n$$\n\\frac{\\alpha x_C N_A}{c D_{AB}} = \\frac{\\alpha x_C N_A}{c D_{AC}}\n$$\nSince component A is evaporating, its flux $N_A$ is non-zero.

Therefore, we can cancel these terms, which yields a condition on the diffusion coefficients:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{D_{AB}} = \\frac{1}{D_{AC}} \\implies D_{AB} = D_{AC}\n$$\nThis means that for the ratio $x_B/x_C$ to remain constant, the diffusivity of A into B must be the same as the diffusivity of A into C.
