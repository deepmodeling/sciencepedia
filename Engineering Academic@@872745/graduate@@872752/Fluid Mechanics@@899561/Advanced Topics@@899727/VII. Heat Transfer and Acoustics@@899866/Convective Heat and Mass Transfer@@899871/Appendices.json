The surface contains a single vapor-trapping conical cavity with a mouth radius of $R$. This cavity acts as a nucleation site for boiling.\n\nThe analysis of boiling incipience from this cavity is to be based on the following physical model:\n\n1.  The temperature profile in the superheated liquid layer adjacent to the heated wall is described by a parabolic relation:\n    $$ \\frac{T(y) - T_{sat}}{T_w - T_{sat}} = \\left(1 - \\frac{y}{\\delta_t}\\right)^2 $$\n    where $y$ is the distance normal to the surface, $T_w$ is the wall temperature, and $\\delta_t$ is the thermal boundary layer thickness.

A spherical vapor nucleus of radius $r$ requires a specific temperature $T_v$ to be in thermodynamic equilibrium with the surrounding liquid.

The criterion for a nucleus to grow into a macroscopic bubble (i.e., boiling incipience) is that the liquid temperature at the crest of the nucleus, $T(y=r)$, must be equal to or greater than the required equilibrium temperature of the nucleus, $T_v(r)$.\n5.
