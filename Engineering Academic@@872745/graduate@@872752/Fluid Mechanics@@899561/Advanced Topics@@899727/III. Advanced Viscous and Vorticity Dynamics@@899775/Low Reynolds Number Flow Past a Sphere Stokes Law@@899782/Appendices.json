As a test, a prototype robot is placed in a large, stationary tank of a sample fluid. The robot has a radius $r$ and is made of a material that allows a set of external electromagnets to exert a constant horizontal force $F_{mag}$ on it.\n\nUnder the influence of this force, the robot accelerates briefly and then reaches a constant terminal velocity, moving horizontally through the fluid. The motion occurs at a very low Reynolds number, meaning the viscous drag force from the fluid is accurately described by Stokes' law: $F_{drag} = 6 \\pi \\eta r v$, where $\\eta$ is the dynamic viscosity of the fluid and $v$ is the speed of the robot.\n\nDetermine a closed-form analytic expression for the power $P$ that the magnetic field expends on the robot, which is subsequently dissipated as heat into the fluid, to maintain this constant velocity.

The problem is to determine the correction to the drag force on Sphere 1 due to the presence of Sphere 2.\n\nThe flow is characterized by a very low Reynolds number, so the governing equations are the Stokes equations. The interactions between the spheres can be analyzed using the method of reflections. To facilitate the analysis, you are given the following established results from low-Reynolds-number hydrodynamics:\n\n1.
