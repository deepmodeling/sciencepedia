For Stokes flow, governed by the biharmonic equation $\\nabla^4 \\psi = 0$ for the stream function $\\psi$, a sharp corner can induce an infinite sequence of eddies, known as Moffatt eddies.\n\nConsider a symmetric flow in a wedge defined by two rigid walls at angles $\\theta = \\pm \\alpha$ in a cylindrical coordinate system $(r, \\theta)$. The no-slip boundary condition applies at the walls. For wedge half-angles $\\alpha$ above a critical value $\\alpha_c \\approx 73.1^\\circ$, the solution for the stream function near the corner vertex ($r=0$) is dominated by an eigenfunction corresponding to a complex eigenvalue $\\lambda = p+iq$. The stream function takes the form:\n$$\n\\psi(r, \\theta) = \\operatorname{Re}\\left[ A r^{\\lambda+1} f(\\theta) \\right]\n$$\nwhere $A$ is a complex constant determined by the flow conditions far from the corner, and $f(\\theta)$ is a complex-valued eigenfunction satisfying the boundary conditions. The real part of the eigenvalue, $p$, is positive. The imaginary part, $q$, is also taken to be positive without loss of generality.\n\nThe presence of the term $r^{iq} = e^{iq\\ln r} = \\cos(q\\ln r) + i\\sin(q\\ln r)$ within the solution gives rise to a spatially oscillatory structure, manifesting as a cascade of eddies of decreasing size and intensity as one approaches the corner at $r=0$. These eddies are geometrically self-similar. Let the eddies be indexed by $n=1, 2, 3, \\dots$ with the first eddy being the largest and furthest from the corner, and subsequent eddies getting progressively smaller and closer to the vertex.\n\nThe circulation of the $n$-th eddy is defined as $\\Gamma_n = \\oint_{C_n} \\mathbf{u} \\cdot d\\mathbf{l}$, where $\\mathbf{u}$ is the velocity field and $C_n$ is the separatrix (a streamline with $\\psi=0$) enclosing the eddy.\n\nBased on the structure of the stream function and the principle of self-similarity, derive the constant ratio of circulations, $\\mathcal{R} = \\Gamma_{n+1}/\\Gamma_n$, between successive eddies in the cascade. Express your answer as a closed-form analytic expression in terms of $p = \\operatorname{Re}(\\lambda)$ and $q = \\operatorname{Im}(\\lambda)$.", "solution": "The problem asks for the ratio of circulations $\\mathcal{R} = \\Gamma_{n+1}/\\Gamma_n$ for successive Moffatt eddies. The solution can be found by analyzing the scaling properties of the flow based on the given form of the stream function.\n\n**1. Geometric Scaling of Eddies**\n\nThe eddies are regions of closed streamlines nested within each other. The boundaries of these eddies (separatrices), as well as their centers, are determined by the oscillatory nature of the stream function $\\psi$. The oscillatory behavior comes from the term $r^{iq} = e^{iq \\ln r}$.\nLet's analyze the flow along the centerline $\\theta=0$. Due to symmetry, $f(\\theta)$ is a real-valued function on the centerline (or more generally, its phase is constant). Let $A f(0) = K e^{i\\phi_0}$, where $K$ and $\\phi_0$ are real constants.\nThe stream function on the centerline is:\n$$\n\\psi(r, 0) = \\operatorname{Re}\\left[ (K e^{i\\phi_0}) r^{p+1+iq} \\right] = \\operatorname{Re}\\left[ K r^{p+1} e^{i(q\\ln r + \\phi_0)} \\right] = K r^{p+1} \\cos(q\\ln r + \\phi_0)\n$$\nThe stagnation points on the centerline, which separate the eddies, are located at radial positions $r_n$ where $\\psi(r_n, 0) = 0$. This occurs when the cosine term is zero:\n$$\nq\\ln r_n + \\phi_0 = \\frac{\\pi}{2} + n\\pi\n$$\nfor integer $n$. We can order the stagnation points such that larger $n$ corresponds to smaller $r_n$ (closer to the vertex). Let's define the sequence for $n=1, 2, \\dots$.\n$$\n\\ln r_n = \\frac{1}{q} \\left( \\frac{\\pi}{2} - \\phi_0 - n\\pi \\right)\n$$\nThe relationship between the radial positions of two successive stagnation points is:\n$$\n\\ln r_{n+1} - \\ln r_n = \\frac{1}{q} (-\\pi) \\implies \\ln\\left(\\frac{r_{n+1}}{r_n}\\right) = -\\frac{\\pi}{q}\n$$\nThe ratio of the radial positions is therefore:\n$$\n\\frac{r_{n+1}}{r_n} = e^{-\\pi/q}\n$$\nSince the eddies are geometrically self-similar, any characteristic linear dimension $L_n$ (like the eddy \"diameter\" or the radial position of the eddy center) must scale in the same way. Thus, the geometric scaling ratio for successive eddies is:\n$$\n\\frac{L_{n+1}}{L_n} = e^{-\\pi/q}\n$$\n\n**2. Scaling of Circulation**\n\nThe circulation $\\Gamma_n$ is the integral of velocity around the separatrix $C_n$. Due to the self-similarity of the flow structure within each eddy, the circulation $\\Gamma_n$ must be proportional to the characteristic velocity $U_n$ and the characteristic length $L_n$ of the eddy: $\\Gamma_n \\propto U_n L_n$. A more direct approach uses the relation between circulation and the stream function.\n\nFor a 2D flow, all dimensionless quantities related to the flow pattern within an eddy are identical due to self-similarity. Let's non-dimensionalize the stream function for the $n$-th eddy by its maximum value within that eddy, $\\psi_{max,n}$, and its characteristic size, $L_n$. Let $\\mathbf{x}^* = \\mathbf{x}/L_n$ and $\\psi_n^*(\\mathbf{x}^*) = \\psi(\\mathbf{x})/\\psi_{max,n}$.\nThe velocity is $\\mathbf{u} = (\\frac{\\partial\\psi}{\\partial y}, -\\frac{\\partial\\psi}{\\partial x})$. A characteristic velocity is $U_n \\sim \\psi_{max,n}/L_n$.\nThe circulation is $\\Gamma_n = \\oint_{C_n} \\mathbf{u} \\cdot d\\mathbf{l}$.\nIn non-dimensional terms: $d\\mathbf{l} = L_n d\\mathbf{l}^*$, and $\\mathbf{u} = U_n \\mathbf{u}^* \\propto (\\psi_{max,n}/L_n) \\mathbf{u}^*$.\n$$\n\\Gamma_n \\propto \\left(\\frac{\\psi_{max,n}}{L_n}\\right) L_n \\oint_{C_n^*} \\mathbf{u}^* \\cdot d\\mathbf{l}^* = \\psi_{max,n} \\times (\\text{a dimensionless constant})\n$$\nSince the dimensionless integral is the same for all eddies due to self-similarity, we have a direct proportionality:\n$$\n\\Gamma_n \\propto \\psi_{max,n}\n$$\n\n**3. Scaling of the Maximum Stream Function**\n\nNow, we need to find how $\\psi_{max,n}$ scales with the eddy number $n$. The eddy center $(r_c, \\theta_c)$ is where $\\psi$ is maximum. The radial position of the center of the $n$-th eddy, $r_{c,n}$, must scale with its size $L_n$, so $r_{c,n} \\propto L_n$.\nThe magnitude of the stream function is given by the amplitude of the expression $\\psi = \\operatorname{Re}\\left[ A r^{\\lambda+1} f(\\theta) \\right]$. The dominant non-oscillatory radial dependence is $r^{p+1}$.\nSo, the maximum value of the stream function in the $n$-th eddy will scale as:\n$$\n\\psi_{max,n} \\propto (r_{c,n})^{p+1} \\propto L_n^{p+1}\n$$\n\n**4. Combining the Scaling Laws**\n\nWe can now find the ratio of circulations:\n$$\n\\mathcal{R} = \\frac{\\Gamma_{n+1}}{\\Gamma_n} = \\frac{\\psi_{max,n+1}}{\\psi_{max,n}} = \\left( \\frac{L_{n+1}}{L_n} \\right)^{p+1}\n$$\nSubstituting the geometric scaling ratio from step 1:\n$$\n\\mathcal{R} = \\left( e^{-\\pi/q} \\right)^{p+1} = e^{-\\frac{\\pi(p+1)}{q}}\n$$\nThis is the constant ratio of circulations for successive Moffatt eddies, expressed in terms of the real and imaginary parts of the dominant complex eigenvalue $\\lambda$. Note that this ratio is independent of the driving flow strength, encapsulated by the constant $A$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{e^{-\\frac{\\pi(p+1)}{q}}}\n$$", "id": "476954"}, {"introduction": "The ideal sharp corner is a mathematical abstraction; real-world corners are always smoothed to some degree.

The corresponding term in the series gives rise to an infinite sequence of eddies.\n\nNow, consider a more realistic scenario where the sharp vertex is replaced by a smooth, rounded boundary with a small, characteristic radius of curvature $a$. The flow is driven by a symmetric external process that, in the absence of the corner singularity, would induce a local straining flow. For a sharp corner, this driving flow would correspond to a particular solution of the form $\\psi_{ext} = K r^2 (\\cos(2\\theta) - \\cos(2\\alpha))$, where $K$ is a constant representing the strength of the straining motion.\n\nFor the rounded corner, the full stream function $\\psi(r, \\theta)$ must be regular everywhere. For distances far from the corner ($r \\gg a$), the solution is well-approximated by the sharp-corner solution, which is a superposition of the driving flow and the leading Moffatt eddy mode:\n$$\n\\psi(r,\\theta) \\approx K r^2 (\\cos(2\\theta) - \\cos(2\\alpha)) + \\text{Re}[C_1 r^{\\lambda_1} f_1(\\theta)]\n$$\nThe complex coefficient $C_1$ depends on the driving strength $K$ and the rounding radius $a$.\n\nAssuming the relationship between the magnitude of the coefficient of the first Moffatt eddy, $|C_1|$, and the rounding radius $a$ can be expressed as a power law of the form $|C_1| \\propto a^\\beta$ for small $a$, derive the value of the exponent $\\beta$.

The stream function $\\psi$ is a function of the coordinates $(r, \\theta)$ and depends on the parameters $K$, $a$, and the corner angle $\\alpha$. We can write this functional dependence as $\\psi(r, \\theta; K, a, \\alpha)$.\n\nThe governing equation for the stream function is the biharmonic equation, $\\nabla^4 \\psi = 0$.

From the expression $\\psi_{ext} = K r^2 (\\dots)$, we can deduce the dimension of $K$: $[K] = [\\psi]/[r^2] = (L^2/T) / L^2 = 1/T$.\n\nLet us define dimensionless variables. We can scale the lengths by the corner radius $a$ and the stream function in a way that eliminates the parameters $K$ and $a$ from the problem.\nDefine the dimensionless radial coordinate $\\tilde{r}$ and the dimensionless stream function $\\tilde{\\psi}$:\n$$\n\\tilde{r} = \\frac{r}{a}\n$$\n$$\n\\tilde{\\psi} = \\frac{\\psi}{K a^2}\n$$\nThe angle $\\theta$ is already dimensionless.\n\nNow, we express the biharmonic equation in terms of these dimensionless variables.\nThe Laplacian in polar coordinates is $\\nabla^2 = \\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial r^2} + \\frac{1}{r}\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial r} + \\frac{1}{r^2}\\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial \\theta^2}$.\nSince $r = a\\tilde{r}$, we have $\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial r} = \\frac{1}{a}\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\tilde{r}}$.\nThe Laplacian transforms as:\n$$\n\\nabla^2 = \\frac{1}{a^2}\\left(\\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial \\tilde{r}^2} + \\frac{1}{\\tilde{r}}\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\tilde{r}} + \\frac{1}{\\tilde{r}^2}\\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial \\theta^2}\\right) = \\frac{1}{a^2}\\tilde{\\nabla}^2\n$$\nThe biharmonic operator then transforms as $\\nabla^4 = (\\frac{1}{a^2}\\tilde{\\nabla}^2)^2 = \\frac{1}{a^4}\\tilde{\\nabla}^4$.\n\nThe governing equation $\\nabla^4 \\psi = 0$ becomes:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{a^4} \\tilde{\\nabla}^4 (K a^2 \\tilde{\\psi}) = 0\n$$\nSince $K$ and $a$ are constants, we have:\n$$\n\\frac{K a^2}{a^4} \\tilde{\\nabla}^4 \\tilde{\\psi} = 0 \\implies \\tilde{\\nabla}^4 \\tilde{\\psi} = 0\n$$\nThe boundary conditions also become dimensionless. The no-slip condition $\\psi=0$ on the rounded corner (which has characteristic size $a$) becomes $\\tilde{\\psi}=0$ on a boundary of characteristic size $\\tilde{r}=1$.
