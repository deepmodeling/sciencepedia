This exercise [@problem_id:1767847] probes this fundamental concept by considering a fluid in solid-body rotation.

The container is initially at rest. It is then spun about its central vertical axis with a constant angular velocity $\\Omega$. After a sufficient amount of time, the entire body of fluid rotates with the container as a rigid body, a state known as solid-body rotation. In this state, the free surface of the fluid assumes a parabolic shape.\n\nConsider a small, imaginary tetrahedron-shaped fluid element located at an arbitrary point within the bulk of the rotating fluid (i.e., not on the free surface or in contact with the container walls). Is the thermodynamic pressure acting on the faces of this element isotropic? Select the best explanation from the choices below.\n\nA. No, the pressure is not isotropic. The centrifugal force, which acts radially outward, creates a higher pressure in the radial direction compared to other directions.\n\nB. No, the pressure is not isotropic. Any fluid motion, including solid-body rotation, necessarily induces viscous shear stresses between adjacent fluid layers, making the total stress state anisotropic.\n\nC. Yes, the pressure remains isotropic. In solid-body rotation, there is no relative motion or deformation between adjacent fluid particles, which means no viscous shear stresses are generated. The stress state is therefore purely compressive and uniform in all directions at any given point.\n\nD. Yes, the pressure remains isotropic, but its value is direction-dependent. The pressure in the radial direction is greater than in the vertical direction at the same point.\n\nE. The concept of pressure is ill-defined for a moving fluid.
