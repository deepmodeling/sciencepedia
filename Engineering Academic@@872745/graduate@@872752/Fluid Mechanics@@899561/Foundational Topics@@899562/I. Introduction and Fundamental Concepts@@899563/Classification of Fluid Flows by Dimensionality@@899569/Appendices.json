A velocity field can have multiple non-zero components but still be classified as one-dimensional.

Mastering this distinction is the first step toward correctly classifying any flow field you encounter.", "problem": "Consider a simplified model for an ocean current driven by a steady, uniform wind in a very large, deep ocean. We establish a coordinate system where the $x$-axis points East, the $y$-axis points North, and the $z$-axis points vertically upwards, with $z=0$ at the mean sea level. In this model, under the influence of wind stress and the Coriolis effect, the horizontal water velocity vector, $\\mathbf{v}$, is found to be independent of the horizontal positions $x$ and $y$. The velocity vector has components only in the horizontal plane, but these components, $u$ (Eastward) and $v$ (Northward), vary with the vertical coordinate $z$. The velocity field is thus described by the functional form $\\mathbf{v}(z) = u(z)\\hat{\\mathbf{i}} + v(z)\\hat{\\mathbf{j}}$.\n\nBased on the standard classification of fluid flows, how would you categorize the dimensionality of this velocity field?\n\nA.

Dependence is assessed with respect to the actual vector field, not just the scalar components in a particular curvilinear basis, because basis vectors may themselves vary with position.\n\nThe given velocity field in cylindrical coordinates is\n$$\n\\mathbf{v}(r,\\theta,z)=C_{1} z\\,\\hat{\\mathbf{r}}(\\theta)+C_{2}\\,\\hat{\\mathbf{k}}.\n$$\nHere $\\hat{\\mathbf{r}}$ depends on the azimuthal coordinate $\\theta$, with the standard identity $\\hat{\\mathbf{r}}(\\theta)=\\cos\\theta\\,\\hat{\\mathbf{i}}+\\sin\\theta\\,\\hat{\\mathbf{j}}$.
