This problem illustrates the distinction between the mechanical energy balance (the extended Bernoulli equation) and the total energy balance (the Steady Flow Energy Equation, SFEE).\n\n**Background:**\n\nThe Steady Flow Energy Equation (SFEE) is a statement of the first law of thermodynamics for an open system (control volume) operating at steady state. For a system with one inlet (1) and one outlet (2), it is written per unit mass as:\n$$ q - w_s = (h_2 - h_1) + \\frac{1}{2}(V_2^2 - V_1^2) + g(z_2 - z_1) $$\nHere, $q$ is the heat added to the fluid per unit mass, $w_s$ is the shaft work done by the fluid per unit mass (e.g., in a turbine), $h$ is the specific enthalpy, $V$ is the fluid velocity, $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity, and $z$ is the elevation. For an incompressible fluid, the change in specific enthalpy is given by $dh = c_p dT + \\frac{1}{\\rho} dp$, where $c_p$ is the specific heat capacity at constant pressure, $T$ is temperature, $\\rho$ is density, and $p$ is pressure.\n\nThe extended Bernoulli equation is a mechanical energy balance that accounts for gains (pumps) and losses (friction, fittings) of mechanical energy.\n\n**Problem Statement:**\n\nA pump with a known hydraulic efficiency $\\eta_p$ is used to transfer an incompressible liquid of density $\\rho$ and specific heat capacity $c_p$ from a large lower reservoir to a large upper reservoir. The free surfaces of the reservoirs are open to the atmosphere. The difference in the free surface elevations is a height $H$. The entire piping system and pump casing are perfectly insulated, preventing any heat exchange with the surroundings. Due to viscosity, the flow experiences a total frictional head loss of $h_L$ over the length of the pipe. The acceleration due to gravity is $g$.\n\nStarting from the general form of the Steady Flow Energy Equation, derive a symbolic expression for the temperature increase of the fluid, $\\Delta T = T_{out} - T_{in}$, as it flows from the lower reservoir to the upper reservoir. Your final expression should be in terms of $g$, $H$, $h_L$, $c_p$, and $\\eta_p$.", "solution": "Starting from the Steady Flow Energy Equation per unit mass for one inlet (1) and one outlet (2):\n$$q - w_s = (h_2 - h_1) + \\tfrac12\\bigl(V_2^2 - V_1^2\\bigr) + g(z_2 - z_1).$$\n1. Insulation implies $q=0$. Large reservoirs at both ends imply $V_1=V_2\\simeq0$. Since surfaces are open to atmosphere, $p_1=p_2$.
