## Introduction
The integral forms of the [conservation of mass](@entry_id:268004), [linear momentum](@entry_id:174467), and angular momentum are foundational pillars of fluid mechanics. They provide a robust and versatile framework for analyzing fluid systems on a macroscopic scale, offering powerful insights without the need for solving the complex differential equations that govern the flow at every point. This control-volume approach is indispensable for engineers and scientists who need to determine global quantities like forces, torques, and flow rates in complex systems, from simple pipe bends to advanced rocket engines.

This article addresses the fundamental challenge of applying basic physical laws, originally stated for a fixed quantity of matter, to a continuous flow of fluid observed within a specific region. It bridges the gap between abstract principles and practical problem-solving. Over the subsequent chapters, you will gain a comprehensive understanding of this powerful methodology. The article begins with the **Principles and Mechanisms**, deriving the conservation laws from discrete particle mechanics and establishing the crucial mathematical link provided by the Reynolds Transport Theorem. Following this, the **Applications and Interdisciplinary Connections** chapter demonstrates the extraordinary versatility of these laws across engineering, rheology, thermodynamics, and even astrophysics. Finally, a series of **Hands-On Practices** will allow you to solidify your knowledge by applying these integral methods to solve realistic, challenging problems.

## Principles and Mechanisms

The [integral conservation laws](@entry_id:202878) of mass, momentum, and angular momentum form the bedrock of fluid dynamics, providing a powerful framework for analyzing [fluid motion](@entry_id:182721) without requiring a detailed point-by-point solution of the flow field. These laws are statements about the bulk behavior of fluid within a finite region, known as a **control volume**. This chapter will develop these principles from their fundamental origins, establish the mathematical machinery required for their application, and demonstrate their utility through a range of physical scenarios, from simple engineering systems to complex turbulent flows.

### From Particles to the Continuum: The Origin of Conservation Laws

The continuum model of a fluid, wherein properties such as density and velocity are defined as continuous fields, is a powerful idealization. Its justification stems from a coarse-graining of an underlying system of discrete particles. The fundamental laws of mechanics, applied to this discrete system, give rise to the familiar conservation laws of [continuum mechanics](@entry_id:155125).

Consider a system of interacting particles governed by Newton's laws. The mass of the system is inherently conserved. The [total linear momentum](@entry_id:173071) changes only in response to the sum of external forces, as [internal forces](@entry_id:167605) between any two particles cancel out due to Newton's third law ($\mathbf{f}_{ij} = -\mathbf{f}_{ji}$). Similarly, the total angular momentum changes in response to external torques. If we further assume that the internal forces are **[central forces](@entry_id:267832)**—that is, the force $\mathbf{f}_{ij}$ acts along the line connecting particles $i$ and $j$—then the [internal forces](@entry_id:167605) exert no net torque on the system, and angular momentum is conserved in the absence of external torques.

The transition to a continuum involves averaging these particle properties over small volumes. Through a formal mathematical procedure such as mollification, one can define a continuous **mass density field** $\rho(\mathbf{x},t)$ and a **linear momentum density field** $\rho(\mathbf{x},t)\mathbf{v}(\mathbf{x},t)$ from the discrete particle masses and velocities. As demonstrated through rigorous derivation [@problem_id:2871737], applying this process to the particle-level conservation laws yields the continuum conservation laws in their local, [differential form](@entry_id:174025).

A crucial insight from this bottom-up derivation concerns the origin of stress. The external forces on the particles (like gravity) manifest as a **body force field** $\mathbf{b}(\mathbf{x},t)$ in the continuum description. The internal, inter-particle forces give rise to the concept of **internal stress**. The net effect of these microscopic forces across an imaginary surface within the fluid is what we macroscopically identify as the **[traction vector](@entry_id:189429)**, and their spatial variation is captured by the divergence of the **Cauchy stress tensor**, $\nabla \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma}$. The concept of [surface traction](@entry_id:198058) does not exist at the fundamental particle level; it emerges as a continuum representation of [internal forces](@entry_id:167605) [@problem_id:2871690] [@problem_id:2871737].

Furthermore, the assumption of [central forces](@entry_id:267832) at the particle level has a profound consequence for the continuum model: it ensures that the resulting Cauchy stress tensor is symmetric ($\boldsymbol{\sigma} = \boldsymbol{\sigma}^T$). As we will see, the symmetry of the stress tensor is precisely the condition required to satisfy the local [balance of angular momentum](@entry_id:181848) in a classical continuum. Thus, the [symmetry of stress](@entry_id:181684) is not an independent postulate but can be understood as a direct consequence of the physical nature of the microscopic interactions.

### The Reynolds Transport Theorem: A Kinematic Foundation

The fundamental laws of mechanics are typically stated for a fixed collection of matter, which we call a **material volume** or system. As this material volume moves and deforms with the fluid, the domain of integration for any property contained within it changes with time. The **Reynolds Transport Theorem (RTT)** is the fundamental kinematic tool that relates the time rate of change of an integral over a material volume to integrals over a fixed or arbitrarily moving **[control volume](@entry_id:143882)** (CV).

Let $\phi(\mathbf{x},t)$ be any intensive property of the fluid (e.g., density $\rho$, or a component of momentum density $\rho v_i$). Let $\Phi(t)$ be the total amount of this property within a material volume $V_m(t)$:
$$ \Phi(t) = \int_{V_m(t)} \phi(\mathbf{x},t) \, dV $$
The RTT states that the time derivative of $\Phi(t)$ is:
$$ \frac{d\Phi}{dt} = \frac{d}{dt} \int_{V_m(t)} \phi \, dV = \int_{V_m(t)} \left( \frac{\partial \phi}{\partial t} + \nabla \cdot (\phi \mathbf{v}) \right) dV $$
where $\mathbf{v}(\mathbf{x},t)$ is the [fluid velocity](@entry_id:267320) field. The term $\frac{\partial \phi}{\partial t}$ is the local rate of change at a fixed point, while $\nabla \cdot (\phi \mathbf{v})$ accounts for the net flux of $\phi$ out of a differential volume due to [fluid motion](@entry_id:182721).

More generally, for a control volume $CV(t)$ whose surface moves with a velocity $\mathbf{w}(\mathbf{x},t)$, the RTT takes the form:
$$ \frac{d}{dt} \int_{CV(t)} \phi \, dV = \int_{CV(t)} \frac{\partial \phi}{\partial t} \, dV + \int_{\partial CV(t)} \phi \mathbf{w} \cdot \mathbf{n} \, dA $$
Here, $\mathbf{n}$ is the outward-pointing unit normal to the control surface $\partial CV(t)$. The first term on the right is the rate of change due to local variations of the field $\phi$ within the volume, and the second term is the rate of change due to the motion of the boundary itself. By combining this with the [material derivative](@entry_id:266939) form of the RTT, we arrive at the most common form used for deriving the conservation laws:
$$ \frac{d}{dt} \int_{V_m(t)} \phi \, dV = \frac{d}{dt} \int_{CV(t)} \phi \, dV + \int_{\partial CV(t)} \phi (\mathbf{v} - \mathbf{w}) \cdot \mathbf{n} \, dA $$
This equation provides a direct link between the Lagrangian perspective (following a material volume) and the Eulerian perspective (observing a control volume).

For these mathematical operations to be valid, certain regularity conditions on the [control volume](@entry_id:143882) and the fields are necessary. Rigorously, the derivation of the RTT requires that the [control volume](@entry_id:143882) boundary be sufficiently smooth, for instance, a **Lipschitz domain**. This ensures that the outward normal $\mathbf{n}$ is defined almost everywhere and that the [divergence theorem](@entry_id:145271) is applicable. The mappings describing the motion of the [control volume](@entry_id:143882) boundary must also be differentiable in time. Various specific sets of assumptions, such as defining the volume motion via a $C^1$ family of bi-Lipschitz maps or describing the boundary as a piecewise $C^1$ surface, are sufficient to justify the theorem without pathological issues like line or corner terms in the flux integrals [@problem_id:2871713].

### The Integral Conservation Laws for a Control Volume

By combining the physical postulates of conservation for a material volume with the kinematic Reynolds Transport Theorem, we can derive the [integral conservation laws](@entry_id:202878) in their most useful form, applied to a general [control volume](@entry_id:143882). For simplicity, we will present the laws for a **fixed [control volume](@entry_id:143882)** ($CV$), where the boundary velocity $\mathbf{w} = \mathbf{0}$.

#### Conservation of Mass

The postulate is that the mass of a material volume is constant:
$$ \frac{d}{dt} \int_{V_m(t)} \rho \, dV = 0 $$
Applying the RTT with $\phi = \rho$ and a fixed [control volume](@entry_id:143882) that instantaneously coincides with the material volume gives:
$$ \frac{d}{dt} \int_{CV} \rho \, dV + \int_{CS} \rho (\mathbf{v} \cdot \mathbf{n}) \, dA = 0 $$
This is the **integral form of the conservation of mass**, also known as the continuity equation. It states that the rate of increase of mass inside the control volume must equal the net rate of mass flowing into the [control volume](@entry_id:143882) across its surface ($CS = \partial CV$). For a **steady flow**, where properties do not change with time at any point, the first term vanishes, and the equation simplifies to state that the mass flow rate in equals the [mass flow rate](@entry_id:264194) out.

#### Conservation of Linear Momentum

The postulate is Newton's second law for a material volume: the rate of change of its [total linear momentum](@entry_id:173071) equals the sum of all forces acting on it.
$$ \frac{d}{dt} \int_{V_m(t)} \rho \mathbf{v} \, dV = \sum \mathbf{F} $$
The forces are categorized as **body forces** (acting on the volume, e.g., gravity) and **[surface forces](@entry_id:188034)** (acting on the boundary, e.g., pressure and viscous stresses). Thus, $\sum \mathbf{F} = \int_{CV} \rho \mathbf{b} \, dV + \mathbf{F}_{surf}$. Applying the RTT with $\phi = \rho \mathbf{v}$ yields the **[integral momentum equation](@entry_id:272259)**:
$$ \frac{d}{dt} \int_{CV} \rho \mathbf{v} \, dV + \int_{CS} \rho \mathbf{v} (\mathbf{v} \cdot \mathbf{n}) \, dA = \sum \mathbf{F} $$
This powerful equation states that the sum of all forces acting on the fluid within the [control volume](@entry_id:143882) equals the rate of change of momentum stored inside the [control volume](@entry_id:143882) plus the net rate of [momentum flux](@entry_id:199796) out of the [control volume](@entry_id:143882). In many engineering applications, one is interested in the force exerted *by* the fluid *on* a solid object (e.g., a pipe bend, a turbine blade). By choosing the [control volume](@entry_id:143882) to enclose the object and the fluid in contact with it, the term $\sum \mathbf{F}$ includes this reaction force, which can then be calculated from the momentum fluxes at the inlets and outlets.

#### Conservation of Angular Momentum

The postulate for angular momentum states that the rate of change of the [total angular momentum](@entry_id:155748) of a material volume about a fixed origin equals the sum of all external torques (moments) about that same origin.
$$ \frac{d}{dt} \int_{V_m(t)} (\mathbf{r} \times \rho \mathbf{v}) \, dV = \sum \mathbf{M} $$
where $\mathbf{r}$ is the position vector from the origin. The torques arise from body forces and [surface forces](@entry_id:188034): $\sum \mathbf{M} = \int_{CV} (\mathbf{r} \times \rho \mathbf{b}) \, dV + \mathbf{M}_{surf}$. Applying the RTT with $\phi = \mathbf{r} \times \rho \mathbf{v}$ gives the **[integral angular momentum equation](@entry_id:188680)**:
$$ \frac{d}{dt} \int_{CV} (\mathbf{r} \times \rho \mathbf{v}) \, dV + \int_{CS} (\mathbf{r} \times \rho \mathbf{v}) (\mathbf{v} \cdot \mathbf{n}) \, dA = \sum \mathbf{M} $$
This equation is fundamental for analyzing rotating fluid machinery (pumps, turbines) and for calculating the reaction torques required to hold fluid-carrying structures stationary. For instance, to compute the reaction torque needed to hold a complex pipe fixture in place, one can define a control volume surrounding the fixture and evaluate the net flux of angular momentum through the inlet and outlet ports. The resultant moment from the momentum fluxes must be balanced by the reaction torque from the support [@problem_id:541290].

### The Localization Procedure and the Symmetry of Stress

While the integral laws are powerful for [global analysis](@entry_id:188294), deriving the local differential equations that govern the flow at every point requires a **localization argument** [@problem_id:2871690]. The procedure relies on the postulate that the integral law must hold for *any* arbitrary sub-volume within the flow.

By first using the Reynolds Transport Theorem and then the **Divergence Theorem** to convert all [surface integrals](@entry_id:144805) into [volume integrals](@entry_id:183482), each [integral conservation law](@entry_id:175062) can be written in the form:
$$ \int_{V} f(\mathbf{x}, t) \, dV = 0 $$
where $V$ is an arbitrary volume. If the integrand $f(\mathbf{x},t)$ is a continuous function, the only way for this integral to be zero for any choice of $V$ (no matter how small) is if the integrand itself is zero everywhere. This is the essence of the localization argument, which yields the local differential equations of [fluid motion](@entry_id:182721).

-   **Mass:** The continuity equation $\frac{\partial \rho}{\partial t} + \nabla \cdot (\rho \mathbf{v}) = 0$ is obtained directly from localizing the integral [mass balance](@entry_id:181721).
-   **Linear Momentum:** To localize the momentum equation, we must first express the surface force in a form suitable for the [divergence theorem](@entry_id:145271). This requires the **Cauchy Postulate**, which states that the [traction vector](@entry_id:189429) $\mathbf{t}(\mathbf{n})$ is a linear function of the [normal vector](@entry_id:264185) $\mathbf{n}$, given by $\mathbf{t}(\mathbf{n}) = \boldsymbol{\sigma} \cdot \mathbf{n}$ (or $\boldsymbol{\sigma}^T \cdot \mathbf{n}$, by convention). The second-order tensor $\boldsymbol{\sigma}$ is the Cauchy stress tensor. This step is essential; without it, the [surface integral](@entry_id:275394) of traction cannot be converted into a volume integral of the [divergence of stress](@entry_id:185633), and the localization cannot be completed [@problem_id:2871690]. The resulting local momentum equation is $\frac{\partial(\rho \mathbf{v})}{\partial t} + \nabla \cdot (\rho \mathbf{v} \otimes \mathbf{v}) = \rho \mathbf{b} + \nabla \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma}$.
-   **Angular Momentum:** Applying the localization procedure to the angular momentum balance, and substituting in the local [linear momentum equation](@entry_id:262110), yields the algebraic condition $\boldsymbol{\epsilon} : \boldsymbol{\sigma}^T = \mathbf{0}$, where $\boldsymbol{\epsilon}$ is the permutation tensor. This is equivalent to stating that the stress tensor must be symmetric, $\boldsymbol{\sigma} = \boldsymbol{\sigma}^T$. This confirms, at the continuum level, the conclusion reached from the microscopic viewpoint assuming [central forces](@entry_id:267832) [@problem_id:2871737].

For flows with discontinuities, such as [shock waves](@entry_id:142404), the localization procedure is adapted by applying the integral laws to a small "pillbox" control volume straddling the discontinuity, leading to the **Rankine-Hugoniot jump conditions** [@problem_id:2871690].

### Applications in Inertial and Non-Inertial Frames

The true power of the [integral conservation laws](@entry_id:202878) is revealed in their application to a wide array of physical problems.

#### Forces, Torques, and Unsteady Analysis

In many steady-state engineering problems, the goal is to determine the net forces or torques on a body. The integral momentum and angular momentum equations are perfectly suited for this. A common strategy involves defining a control volume whose boundaries are aligned with solid surfaces (where velocities are known) and cross sections of the flow where velocity profiles can be reasonably assumed.

For example, consider a channel flow where fluid is removed through porous walls. The mass removal causes the [mean velocity](@entry_id:150038) and thus the [momentum flux](@entry_id:199796) to decrease along the channel. An application of the integral mass and linear momentum equations to a differential [control volume](@entry_id:143882) reveals that the axial pressure gradient required to drive the flow is altered not only by viscous wall shear but also by this change in convective momentum [@problem_id:541209].

The unsteady terms in the integral laws are crucial for analyzing transient phenomena. For a fluid spinning down in a cylinder that is suddenly stopped, the [integral angular momentum equation](@entry_id:188680) can be integrated over the entire spin-down time ($t=0$ to $t=\infty$). The initial angular momentum is known, and the final angular momentum is zero. The total change in the fluid's angular momentum must equal the **[angular impulse](@entry_id:166396)** (time integral of torque) exerted by the cylinder wall on the fluid. This provides a direct way to calculate the total impulse without needing to solve for the complex, time-evolving [velocity field](@entry_id:271461) during the transient process [@problem_id:541203].

#### Analysis in Non-Inertial Frames

When the [control volume](@entry_id:143882) is defined within a non-inertial (accelerating or rotating) reference frame, the statement of Newton's second law must be modified to include **fictitious forces**. For a frame accelerating linearly with $\mathbf{a}_0$ and rotating with [angular velocity](@entry_id:192539) $\boldsymbol{\omega}$, the [integral momentum equation](@entry_id:272259) becomes:
$$ \frac{d}{dt} \int_{CV} \rho \mathbf{v}_r \, dV + \int_{CS} \rho \mathbf{v}_r (\mathbf{v}_r \cdot \mathbf{n}) \, dA = \sum \mathbf{F}_{real} - \int_{CV} \rho \left( \mathbf{a}_0 + 2\boldsymbol{\omega} \times \mathbf{v}_r + \boldsymbol{\omega} \times (\boldsymbol{\omega} \times \mathbf{r}) \right) dV $$
where $\mathbf{v}_r$ is the fluid velocity relative to the [non-inertial frame](@entry_id:275577).

A particularly important special case is **[rigid-body motion](@entry_id:265795)**, where the fluid is stationary relative to the [non-inertial frame](@entry_id:275577) ($\mathbf{v}_r = \mathbf{0}$). In this state, the momentum fluxes vanish, and the equation simplifies to a balance between real forces (pressure, gravity) and fictitious forces. The local form of this balance is $\nabla p = \rho (\mathbf{g} - \mathbf{a}_{eff})$, where $\mathbf{a}_{eff}$ represents the sum of all frame accelerations. This "hydrostatic" balance in a [non-inertial frame](@entry_id:275577) determines the pressure field and the shape of any free surfaces. For instance, the free surface of a liquid in a linearly accelerating tank becomes a tilted plane whose angle $\theta$ is given by $\tan(\theta) = a_x/g$ [@problem_id:541219]. Similarly, the parabolic shape of the free surface in a rotating container and the height difference in a rotating U-tube [manometer](@entry_id:138596) are direct consequences of this balance between pressure gradient, gravity, and the centrifugal acceleration [@problem_id:541254].

#### Advanced Applications to Turbulent Flows

Integral methods retain their utility even in the complex realm of turbulent flows. By applying the conservation laws to the **Reynolds-averaged** velocity and pressure fields, we can derive relationships between the bulk properties of a turbulent flow. This approach is powerful when combined with physically motivated hypotheses about the flow structure.

For example, in a turbulent buoyant plume, one can assume simplified "top-hat" profiles for velocity and buoyancy and model the mixing with ambient fluid via an **[entrainment hypothesis](@entry_id:191683)**, which relates the inflow velocity at the plume's edge to the local centerline velocity. Applying the integral balances of mass, momentum, and buoyancy to a thin slice of the plume allows for the derivation of a set of ordinary differential equations governing the growth of the plume's width and the evolution of its centerline velocity. Solving these equations yields scaling laws that describe how the plume's volume flux grows with height [@problem_id:541240]. A similar analysis can be applied to a turbulent swirling jet, where the conserved quantities of axial and angular [momentum flux](@entry_id:199796) can be related to the fluxes of kinetic energy and the decay of swirl intensity, providing invaluable insight into the flow's large-scale structure [@problem_id:541287]. In these advanced scenarios, the [integral conservation laws](@entry_id:202878) serve as fundamental constraints that shape the global behavior of the flow, even when the detailed turbulent fluctuations are intractably complex.
