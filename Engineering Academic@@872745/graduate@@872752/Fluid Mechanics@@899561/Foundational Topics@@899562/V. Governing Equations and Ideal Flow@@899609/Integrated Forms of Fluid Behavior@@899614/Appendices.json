This exercise, [@problem_id:542235], provides a hands-on derivation of the Taylor-Aris dispersion coefficient, a cornerstone of transport phenomena. By integrating the advection-diffusion equation across a pipe's cross-section, you will see how the combination of a parabolic velocity profile and radial molecular diffusion results in an effective axial dispersion far greater than diffusion alone, elegantly simplifying a complex 3D problem into a manageable 1D model.", "problem": "Consider the transport of a solute in a long, circular pipe of radius $R$. The fluid moves with a steady, incompressible, and fully developed laminar flow, characterized by the parabolic Poiseuille velocity profile $u(r) = U_{max} \\left(1 - \\frac{r^2}{R^2}\\right)$, where $r$ is the radial coordinate and $U_{max}$ is the maximum velocity at the centerline. The mean velocity is $U = U_{max}/2$.\n\nThe concentration of the solute, $C(t, x, r)$, is governed by the advection-diffusion equation. Assuming the system is axisymmetric and that axial diffusion is negligible compared to axial convection, but radial diffusion is significant, the transport equation in a frame of reference moving with the mean velocity $U$ is:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial C}{\\partial t} + u'(r) \\frac{\\partial C}{\\partial x'} = D \\left( \\frac{1}{r} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial r} \\left( r \\frac{\\partial C}{\\partial r} \\right) \\right)\n$$\nHere, $x' = x - Ut$ is the axial coordinate in the moving frame, $u'(r) = u(r) - U = U\\left(1 - 2\\frac{r^2}{R^2}\\right)$ is the velocity profile relative to the mean velocity, and $D$ is the molecular diffusion coefficient of the solute.\n\nAfter an initial transient period, the transport process can be simplified. A quasi-steady state is reached in the radial direction, where the radial diffusive flux balances the effects of differential advection. This leads to a concentration profile where the radial variation, $C' = C - C_m$, is proportional to the local axial gradient of the cross-sectionally averaged concentration, $\\frac{\\partial C_m}{\\partial x'}$. The averaged concentration is defined as $C_m(t, x') = \\frac{1}{\\pi R^2} \\int_0^R C(t, x', r) 2\\pi r dr$.\n\nThis simplification allows one to model the evolution of the cross-sectionally averaged concentration $C_m$ with an effective one-dimensional advection-diffusion equation:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial C_m}{\\partial t} = K \\frac{\\partial^2 C_m}{\\partial x'^2}\n$$\nThis equation describes the dispersion of the solute slug as viewed from the frame moving at the mean velocity $U$. Your task is to derive the total effective axial dispersion coefficient, $K$, also known as the Taylor-Aris dispersion coefficient.\n\nAssume the following:\n1.  The quasi-steady balance between differential advection and radial diffusion is given by:\n    $$\n    u'(r) \\frac{\\partial C_m}{\\partial x'} \\approx D \\frac{1}{r} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial r} \\left( r \\frac{\\partial C'}{\\partial r} \\right)\n    $$\n    where $C' = C - C_m$. For this calculation, you can treat $\\frac{\\partial C_m}{\\partial x'}$ as a constant with respect to $r$.\n2.  There is no flux of solute at the pipe wall ($r=R$) and at the centerline ($r=0$), so $\\frac{\\partial C}{\\partial r} = 0$ at these locations.\n3.  The average of the concentration deviation $C'$ over the cross-section is zero by definition: $\\int_0^R C'(r) 2\\pi r dr = 0$.\n4.  The effective diffusive flux in the moving frame is $J_{eff} = \\frac{1}{\\pi R^2} \\int_0^R u'(r) C'(r) 2\\pi r dr$, and it is related to the effective dispersion coefficient via Fick's law: $J_{eff} = -K_{Taylor} \\frac{\\partial C_m}{\\partial x'}$. The total effective dispersion coefficient is the sum of this Taylor dispersion term and the molecular diffusion: $K = D + K_{Taylor}$.\n\nDerive the expression for the total effective axial dispersion coefficient $K$ in terms of the mean velocity $U$, pipe radius $R$, and molecular diffusion coefficient $D$.", "solution": "We denote $G=\\frac{\\partial C_m}{\\partial x'}$ (constant in $r$).
