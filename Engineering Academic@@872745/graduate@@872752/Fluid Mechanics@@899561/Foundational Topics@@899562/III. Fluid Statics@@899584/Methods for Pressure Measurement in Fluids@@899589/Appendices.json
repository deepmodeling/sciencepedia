These devices rely on the subtle deformation of a micro-diaphragm, but their behavior is governed by a complex interplay of multiple physical phenomena. This advanced practice guides you through the process of modeling a capacitive MEMS sensor by accounting for non-linear mechanical effects like membrane stretching, the compressibility of a sealed reference gas, and the resulting change in capacitance. Developing a relationship between the measured capacitance and the applied external pressure is a crucial step in sensor design and calibration, showcasing the multi-physics challenges in contemporary instrument science [@problem_id:568383].", "problem": "A micro-electro-mechanical system (MEMS) for measuring absolute pressure consists of a flexible circular diaphragm of radius $a$ and thickness $h$, made from a material with Young's modulus $E$ and Poisson's ratio $\\nu$. The diaphragm is clamped at its edges and is suspended over a fixed, rigid backplate, creating an initial gap of height $g_0$. The volume between the diaphragm and the backplate is hermetically sealed, trapping a gas at an initial absolute pressure $P_{ref,0}$. This sealed volume acts as a reference pressure cavity. The diaphragm and the backplate form a parallel-plate capacitor, whose capacitance $C$ changes as the diaphragm deflects under an external absolute pressure $P_{ext}$. The permittivity of the gas in the gap is $\\epsilon$.\n\nFor a comprehensive model of this sensor, three physical effects must be considered:\n1.  **Large Diaphragm Deflection:** The deflection $w(r)$ of the diaphragm from its initial flat position, where $r$ is the radial coordinate, is approximated by the profile $w(r) = w_c(1 - r^2/a^2)^2$, with $w_c$ being the maximum deflection at the center ($r=0$). Due to large deflections, membrane stretching becomes significant. The relationship between the net uniform pressure difference across the diaphragm, $\\Delta P$, and the center deflection $w_c$ is given by:\n    $$ \\Delta P = K_b w_c + K_s w_c^3 $$\n    where $K_b = C_1 \\frac{E h^3}{a^4(1-\\nu^2)}$ is the bending stiffness coefficient and $K_s = C_2 \\frac{E h}{a^4(1-\\nu^2)}$ is the stretching stiffness coefficient. $C_1$ and $C_2$ are given dimensionless constants determined by the plate geometry and boundary conditions.\n\n2.  **Gas Compressibility:** As the diaphragm deflects, the volume of the sealed cavity changes, causing the reference pressure $P_{ref}$ to change. Assume the compression/expansion of the trapped gas is an isothermal process.
