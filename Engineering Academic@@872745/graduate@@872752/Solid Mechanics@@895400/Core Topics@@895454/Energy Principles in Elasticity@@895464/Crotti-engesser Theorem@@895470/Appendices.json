Before using the theorem, the analyst is advised to verify whether the internal power is conservative so that a scalar energy potential governs the stress–strain response, and to ensure that reciprocity and path independence are not violated by dissipation. Starting from the principle of virtual work and the definition of conservative work, assess the following candidate checklist items and common beliefs about applicability.\n\nUse as base the following fundamentals only:\n- Principle of virtual work: the internal virtual work is $\\,\\delta W_{\\mathrm{int}} = \\int_{\\Omega} \\boldsymbol{\\sigma} : \\delta \\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}\\,\\mathrm{d}V\\,$, equated to external virtual work under equilibrium.\n- Conservative constitutive behavior admits a scalar strain energy density $\\,\\Psi(\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon})\\,$ with $\\,\\boldsymbol{\\sigma} = \\partial \\Psi / \\partial \\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}\\,$ so that $\\,\\delta W_{\\mathrm{int}} = \\delta \\int_{\\Omega} \\Psi(\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon})\\,\\mathrm{d}V\\,$ is an exact differential. Equivalently, if the stress–strain mapping is one-to-one and convex, the complementary energy $\\,\\Psi^{\\ast}(\\boldsymbol{\\sigma})\\,$ exists with $\\,\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon} = \\partial \\Psi^{\\ast} / \\partial \\boldsymbol{\\sigma}\\,$.\n- In dissipative inelasticity, the power splits as $\\,\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}:\\dot{\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}} = \\dot{U} + \\mathcal{D}\\,$ with $\\,\\mathcal{D} \\ge 0\\,$ the dissipation rate. In this case, total internal work depends on the loading path unless $\\,\\mathcal{D} \\equiv 0\\,$ along the path.\n\nWhich options below comprise valid checklist items or correctly identify misconceptions regarding the use of the Crotti–Engesser theorem for plasticity or damage models?\n\nA. Confirm that the constitutive response is hyperelastic or, equivalently, conservative: there exists a strictly convex, continuously differentiable complementary energy $\\,\\Psi^{\\ast}(\\boldsymbol{\\sigma})\\,$ such that $\\,\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon} = \\partial_{\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}}\\Psi^{\\ast}(\\boldsymbol{\\sigma})\\,$ at all material points, that loading is pathwise monotone with no unloading so that the mapping $\\,\\boldsymbol{\\sigma} \\leftrightarrow \\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}\\,$ is one-to-one, that the tangent compliance $\\,\\mathbb{S} = \\partial \\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}/\\partial \\boldsymbol{\\sigma}\\,$ is symmetric and positive definite in the regime of interest, and that work-conjugate stress–strain measures are used. Under these conditions the internal virtual work is an exact differential and the Crotti–Engesser theorem is applicable.\n\nB. In rate-independent associated plasticity, the convexity of the plastic potential alone guarantees that Crotti–Engesser holds globally even under arbitrary cyclic loading, provided the net load trend is increasing. Therefore, one only needs to check convexity of the plastic potential; the existence of a conservative elastic energy can be ignored.\n\nC. A symmetric secant stiffness matrix at the structural level suffices to justify Crotti–Engesser, regardless of whether the material stores energy or dissipates it; even with softening one can rely on secant quantities, because the theorem does not require positive definiteness or path independence.\n\nD. If a Helmholtz free energy $\\,\\Psi(\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon},d)\\,$ exists for an isotropic scalar damage model with damage variable $\\,d\\,$, Crotti–Engesser applies even when $\\,\\partial^{2}\\Psi/\\partial \\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}^{2}\\,$ loses positive definiteness and the response exhibits snap-back, because an energy still exists; reciprocity and path independence then follow.\n\nE.

This means that the work done by internal forces is conservative and can be described by a scalar potential function, either the strain energy $U(\\mathbf{q})$ or the complementary energy $U^*(\\mathbf{P})$. This implies that the work done is path-independent, which is only true if there is no energy dissipation ($\\mathcal{D} \\equiv 0$).

Correct.** This option provides a comprehensive and accurate list of the mathematical conditions that define a hyperelastic material suitable for the theorem's application: existence of a strictly convex complementary energy potential, a one-to-one stress-strain mapping (ensured by monotone loading without unloading), and a symmetric, positive definite tangent compliance tensor. These are precisely the requirements for the theorem to hold.\n\n-   **B. Incorrect.** This is a common misconception. While associated plasticity involves a convex plastic potential, the process is fundamentally dissipative. Any loading path involving plastic flow results in a non-zero dissipation ($\\mathcal{D} > 0$), making the work path-dependent. Cyclic loading creates hysteresis, which is the hallmark of a non-conservative system. The existence of a potential for the *flow rule* does not imply the existence of a potential for the *total work*.\n\n-   **C. Incorrect.** This option contains multiple errors. The theorem's validity is related to the symmetry of the *tangent* modulus, not the *secant* modulus. Path independence is a non-negotiable prerequisite, not an optional feature. Furthermore, the loss of positive definiteness (softening) leads to instabilities where the energy potential is non-convex, invalidating the theorem's simple application.\n\n-   **D. Incorrect.** The existence of a Helmholtz free energy function $\\Psi(\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}, d)$ is a concept from thermodynamics, not a guarantee of mechanical conservativeness. The evolution of the damage variable $d$ is an irreversible, dissipative process. As long as damage grows, energy is dissipated, and the theorem cannot be applied.\n\n-   **E. Correct.** This option presents a physically grounded checklist that is equivalent to the mathematical conditions in option A. It correctly emphasizes the need for conservative internal power (i.e., work derived from a potential), the use of work-conjugate variables, symmetric and positive definite tangent moduli (ensuring integrability and stability), and, crucially, the absence of dissipation ($\\mathcal{D} = 0$).
