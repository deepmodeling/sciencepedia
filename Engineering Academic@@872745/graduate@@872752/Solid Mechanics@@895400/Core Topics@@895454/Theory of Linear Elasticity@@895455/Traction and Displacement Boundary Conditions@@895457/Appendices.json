A complete solution will be provided.\n\n**Derivation**\n\nThe fundamental law governing the relationship between internal stresses and surface forces is the balance of linear momentum. For a body in static equilibrium with no body forces, the differential form of this law is $\\nabla \\cdot \\boldsymbol{\\sigma} = \\mathbf{0}$. The integral form of this same law, when applied to an infinitesimal tetrahedron element, yields Cauchy's traction theorem. This theorem states that the traction vector $t$ acting on a surface with an outward unit normal $n$ is given by a linear transformation of the normal vector by the stress tensor $\\sigma$. In indicial notation, this is $t_i = \\sigma_{ji}n_j$. We will use this theorem, as it is a direct consequence of the requested fundamental principle.\n\nThe Cauchy stress tensor $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}$ and the unit normal vector $n$ are given in a Cartesian basis as:\n$$\n\\boldsymbol{\\sigma} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\sigma_{1} & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & \\sigma_{2} & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & \\sigma_{3} \\end{pmatrix}, \\quad n = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\\\ \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nAccording to Cauchy's traction theorem, the traction vector $t(n)$ is the product of the stress tensor and the normal vector:\n$$\nt(n) = \\boldsymbol{\\sigma} n = \\begin{pmatrix} \\sigma_{1} & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & \\sigma_{2} & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & \\sigma_{3} \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\\\ \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{\\sigma_{1}}{\\sqrt{2}} \\\\ \\frac{\\sigma_{2}}{\\sqrt{2}} \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nNext, we decompose the traction vector $t(n)$ into its normal and tangential components. The traction vector is the sum of its projection onto the normal vector $n$ (the normal component, $t_{\\mathrm{norm}}$) and its projection onto the plane perpendicular to $n$ (the tangential or shear component, $t_{\\mathrm{tan}}$):\n$$\nt(n) = t_{\\mathrm{norm}} + t_{\\mathrm{tan}}\n$$\nThe normal component is the projection of $t(n)$ onto the direction of $n$. Its vector form is given by $t_{\\mathrm{norm}} = (t(n) \\cdot n)n$. The scalar part, $t(n) \\cdot n$, is the magnitude of the normal traction (positive for tension, negative for compression). We compute this scalar first:\n$$\nt(n) \\cdot n = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{\\sigma_{1}}{\\sqrt{2}} \\\\ \\frac{\\sigma_{2}}{\\sqrt{2}} \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\cdot \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\\\ \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix} = \\left(\\frac{\\sigma_{1}}{\\sqrt{2}}\\right)\\left(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\right) + \\left(\\frac{\\sigma_{2}}{\\sqrt{2}}\\right)\\left(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\right) + (0)(0) = \\frac{\\sigma_{1}}{2} + \\frac{\\sigma_{2}}{2} = \\frac{\\sigma_{1} + \\sigma_{2}}{2}\n$$\nThe magnitude of the normal traction is therefore $|t(n) \\cdot n| = \\left|\\frac{\\sigma_{1} + \\sigma_{2}}{2}\\right|$.\n\nThe tangential component vector $t_{\\mathrm{tan}}$ is found by subtracting the normal component vector from the total traction vector:\n$$\nt_{\\mathrm{tan}} = t(n) - t_{\\mathrm{norm}} = t(n) - (t(n) \\cdot n)n\n$$\n$$\nt_{\\mathrm{tan}} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{\\sigma_{1}}{\\sqrt{2}} \\\\ \\frac{\\sigma_{2}}{\\sqrt{2}} \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix} - \\left(\\frac{\\sigma_{1} + \\sigma_{2}}{2}\\right) \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\\\ \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\n$$\nt_{\\mathrm{tan}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\begin{pmatrix} \\sigma_{1} - \\frac{\\sigma_{1} + \\sigma_{2}}{2} \\\\ \\sigma_{2} - \\frac{\\sigma_{1} + \\sigma_{2}}{2} \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{1}{2\\sqrt{2}} \\begin{pmatrix} 2\\sigma_{1} - \\sigma_{1} - \\sigma_{2} \\\\ 2\\sigma_{2} - \\sigma_{1} - \\sigma_{2} \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{1}{2\\sqrt{2}} \\begin{pmatrix} \\sigma_{1} - \\sigma_{2} \\\\ \\sigma_{2} - \\sigma_{1} \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{\\sigma_{1} - \\sigma_{2}}{2\\sqrt{2}} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ -1 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe magnitude of the tangential (shear) traction, $\\|t_{\\mathrm{tan}}\\|$, is the Euclidean norm of this vector:\n$$\n\\|t_{\\mathrm{tan}}\\| = \\left\\| \\frac{\\sigma_{1} - \\sigma_{2}}{2\\sqrt{2}} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ -1 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\right\\| = \\left| \\frac{\\sigma_{1} - \\sigma_{2}}{2\\sqrt{2}} \\right| \\sqrt{1^{2} + (-1)^{2} + 0^{2}} = \\frac{|\\sigma_{1} - \\sigma_{2}|}{2\\sqrt{2}} \\sqrt{2} = \\frac{|\\sigma_{1} - \\sigma_{2}|}{2}\n$$\nNow we compute the required ratio $r$:\n$$\nr = \\frac{\\|t_{\\mathrm{tan}}\\|}{|t(n)\\cdot n|} = \\frac{\\frac{|\\sigma_{1} - \\sigma_{2}|}{2}}{\\left|\\frac{\\sigma_{1} + \\sigma_{2}}{2}\\right|} = \\frac{|\\sigma_{1} - \\sigma_{2}|}{|\\sigma_{1} + \\sigma_{2}|}\n$$\nThis expression is well-defined provided that the denominator is non-zero, i.e., $\\sigma_{1} + \\sigma_{2} \\neq 0$. If $\\sigma_{1} = -\\sigma_{2}$, the normal traction on this specific plane is zero, and the ratio $r$ is undefined.\n\n**Physical Interpretation in the Context of Boundary Conditions**\nIn solid mechanics, boundary value problems require specifying conditions on the boundary of the domain. These conditions are typically of two types: traction or displacement.\n1.  **Traction Boundary Conditions (Neumann type):** These prescribe the traction vector $t$ on a portion of the boundary. The normal component, $(t \\cdot n)$, represents a normal force per unit area, causing tension or compression. For example, a pressure loading on a surface is a prescribed normal traction. The tangential component, $t_{\\mathrm{tan}}$, represents a shear force per unit area, tending to slide material layers relative to one another. An example is a frictional force acting along a surface.\n2.  **Displacement Boundary Conditions (Dirichlet type):** These prescribe the displacement vector $u$ on a portion of the boundary. For instance, a fixed boundary has $\\boldsymbol{u} = \\mathbf{0}$. A roller support might constrain the normal component of displacement ($\\boldsymbol{u} \\cdot \\boldsymbol{n} = 0$) while leaving the tangential displacement free.\n\nThe normal and tangential components of traction are crucial because in a well-posed problem, one cannot simultaneously prescribe traction and displacement in the same direction at the same boundary point. If the normal displacement is prescribed (e.g., a surface is in contact with a rigid, frictionless wall), the normal traction becomes a reaction force determined by the solution. Conversely, if the normal traction is prescribed (e.g., a surface is exposed to a known pressure), the normal displacement is an unknown to be found. The same principle applies to tangential components. This duality is fundamental to formulating and solving problems in elasticity.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\frac{|\\sigma_{1} - \\sigma_{2}|}{|\\sigma_{1} + \\sigma_{2}|}}\n$$", "id": "2706166"}, {"introduction": "A well-posed boundary value problem in elasticity must have a solution that is both unique and physically stable, which is critically dependent on the correct application of boundary conditions.

Consider the following modeling variants and claims about existence, uniqueness, and physical plausibility of the static solution.\n\nSelect all options that are correct. Each option asserts both an example and the mechanism.\n\nA. A horizontal bar with no body force, $b=0$, is subjected to a prescribed axial force $P>0$ at $x=L$ via the traction $\\bar{t}(L)=P/A$. The left end $x=0$ is physically clamped and should be modeled by $u(0)=0$, but is mistakenly modeled as traction-free, $\\bar{t}(0)=0$. Then the static boundary-value problem has no solution, because global equilibrium requires $\\int_{\\partial \\Omega} \\bar{t}\\,dS + \\int_{\\Omega} b\\,dV = 0$, yet the resultant of the applied tractions equals $P\\neq 0$. The mechanism is violation of balance of linear momentum for a static configuration; the bar would undergo rigid-body acceleration in reality.\n\nB. The same bar with $b=0$ is loaded by equal and opposite end tractions $\\bar{t}(L)=P/A$ and $\\bar{t}(0)=-P/A$, while no displacement boundary condition is imposed anywhere (the physical clamp is replaced by a traction). Then the strain and stress fields are unique, but the displacement field is nonunique: $u(x)$ is determined only up to an arbitrary additive constant. The mechanism is the presence of a rigid-body translation mode when only traction (natural) boundary conditions are imposed and the resultant force and moment vanish.\n\nC. A vertical bar of length $L$ with body force $b=\\rho g>0$ uniformly downward (with $\\rho$ the density and $g$ the gravitational acceleration) has both ends mistakenly modeled as traction-free, $\\bar{t}(0)=0$ and $\\bar{t}(L)=0$, although physically the top end should be clamped, $u(0)=0$. Then the static boundary-value problem has no solution, because integrating $\\dfrac{d\\sigma}{dx} + \\rho g = 0$ gives $\\sigma(x)=-\\rho g x + C$, and applying $\\sigma(0)=0$ and $\\sigma(L)=0$ forces $\\rho g L = 0$, a contradiction for $L>0$ and $\\rho g>0$. The mechanism is that the nonzero resultant body force $\\int_{\\Omega} b\\,dV$ is unbalanced by surface tractions in statics.\n\nD. In the setting of option B, if one additionally imposes $u(x^\\star)=0$ at a single point $x^\\star \\in (0,L)$ (while keeping the end tractions unchanged), the displacement field remains nonunique. The mechanism is that fixing a single point is insufficient to eliminate the rigid-body mode in a one-dimensional bar under pure traction loading.\n\nChoose all that apply: A, B, C, D.", "solution": "We proceed from the fundamental governing equations and definitions, and analyze each option in turn using balance laws, constitutive relations, and boundary conditions.\n\nGeneral one-dimensional setup.

Alternatively, from the field equations: with $b=0$, equilibrium implies $\\sigma(x)=C$ for some constant $C$. The boundary conditions demand $\\sigma(0) = -\\bar{t}(0)=0$ and $\\sigma(L) = \\bar{t}(L)=P/A$, which are incompatible unless $P=0$. Therefore there is no static stress field that satisfies both end conditions. Physically, the nonzero resultant force $P$ would cause rigid-body acceleration; in a purely static formulation this manifests as nonexistence (ill-posedness). Verdict: Correct.\n\nOption B. Data: $b=0$, $\\bar{t}(L)=P/A$, $\\bar{t}(0)=-P/A$, and no displacement boundary condition.

Field solution: $b=0$ implies $\\sigma(x)=C$, a constant. Enforcing $\\sigma(L)=\\bar{t}(L)=P/A$ and $\\sigma(0)=-\\bar{t}(0)=P/A$ consistently yields $C=P/A$. Then $\\dfrac{du}{dx} = \\sigma/E = (P/A)/E$, so $u(x) = \\left(\\dfrac{P}{AE}\\right) x + C_0$ for an arbitrary constant $C_0$. The stress $\\sigma$ and strain $\\varepsilon$ are unique, but the displacement has an undetermined additive constant $C_0$, which is precisely the one-dimensional rigid-body translation. This nonuniqueness is the standard consequence of a pure traction problem with vanishing resultant force and moment. Verdict: Correct.\n\nOption C. Data: vertical bar with body force $b=\\rho g>0$ downward, and both ends traction-free: $\\bar{t}(0)=0$, $\\bar{t}(L)=0$ (erroneously modeling a physically clamped top as free).

The first condition gives $C=0$, and the second gives $-\\rho g\\, L = 0$, which is impossible for $L>0$ and $\\rho g>0$. Equivalently, the global equilibrium condition fails:\n$$\nA\\,\\bar{t}(L) + A\\,\\bar{t}(0) + \\int_0^L A\\, (\\rho g)\\, dx \\;=\\; 0 + 0 + A\\,\\rho g\\, L \\;\\neq\\; 0.\n$$\nThus, no static solution exists. Physically, the weight is unbalanced, so in reality the body would accelerate; the static model is ill-posed under these boundary conditions. Verdict: Correct.\n\nOption D. This option augments the setting of option B by fixing the displacement at a single internal point $x^\\star \\in (0,L)$: $u(x^\\star)=0$. The difference of any two displacement solutions $\\tilde{u}(x)$ under the same tractions with $b=0$ satisfies the homogeneous problem with zero tractions; by the uniqueness theorem (or by the energy argument), this implies $\\tilde{\\varepsilon} = \\dfrac{d\\tilde{u}}{dx} = 0$ everywhere, hence $\\tilde{u}(x) = C_0$, a spatially constant rigid-body translation. Imposing $u(x^\\star)=0$ for both solutions enforces $\\tilde{u}(x^\\star)=0$, which forces $C_0=0$. Therefore the displacement field becomes unique.
