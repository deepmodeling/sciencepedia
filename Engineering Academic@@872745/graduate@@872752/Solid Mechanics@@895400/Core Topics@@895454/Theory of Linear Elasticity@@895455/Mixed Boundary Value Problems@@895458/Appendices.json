It is a well-posed problem in one-dimensional linear elasticity, grounded in fundamental principles of solid mechanics, and is free of any scientific or logical flaws. We shall proceed with its formal derivation and solution.\n\nThe derivation begins from the first principles of continuum mechanics.\nFirst, consider the balance of linear momentum, which in a one-dimensional static case without body forces, reduces to local force equilibrium. Let $\\sigma(x)$ be the axial normal stress field and $A$ be the constant cross-sectional area. The axial force at any cross-section $x$ is $F(x) = A\\sigma(x)$. For a differential element of the bar between $x$ and $x+dx$, equilibrium requires that the sum of forces is zero. Thus, $F(x+dx) - F(x) = 0$. Dividing by $dx$ and taking the limit as $dx \\to 0$ gives the differential form of equilibrium:\n$$\n\\frac{dF}{dx} = 0 \\implies \\frac{d}{dx}(A\\sigma(x)) = 0\n$$\nSince the area $A$ is constant, this simplifies to $\\frac{d\\sigma}{dx} = 0$.\n\nSecond, we employ the constitutive relation for a linearly elastic material, which is Hooke's law. For uniaxial stress, this is:\n$$\n\\sigma(x) = E \\varepsilon(x)\n$$\nwhere $E$ is the Young's modulus and $\\varepsilon(x)$ is the axial strain.\n\nThird, we use the kinematic relation for small strains, which connects the strain field $\\varepsilon(x)$ to the displacement field $u(x)$:\n$$\n\\varepsilon(x) = \\frac{du}{dx}\n$$\n\nSubstituting the kinematic and constitutive relations into the equilibrium equation yields the governing ordinary differential equation (ODE) for the displacement $u(x)$.\n$$\n\\frac{d}{dx} \\left( E \\frac{du}{dx} \\right) = 0\n$$\nSince the bar is homogeneous, $E$ is constant. The product $EA$ is the constant axial rigidity. The governing ODE for $x \\in (0,L)$ is therefore:\n$$\nEA \\frac{d^2u}{dx^2} = 0 \\implies \\frac{d^2u}{dx^2} = 0\n$$\n\nNext, we must establish the boundary conditions.\nAt the left end, $x=0$, the bar is rigidly fixed. This means the displacement at this point is zero. This constitutes a Dirichlet boundary condition:\n$$\nu(0) = 0\n$$\nAt the right end, $x=L$, we must perform a force balance. The internal force exerted by the bar at this boundary is $A\\sigma(L)$. This internal force must balance the externally applied forces. The external forces consist of the applied dead load $P$ acting in the positive $x$-direction and the force from the linear spring. The spring is stretched by an amount equal to the displacement of the bar's end, $u(L)$, so it exerts a restoring force $F_{spring} = k u(L)$ in the negative $x$-direction. The force balance equation at $x=L$ is:\n$$\nA\\sigma(L) = P - k u(L)\n$$\nSubstituting $\\sigma(L) = E \\varepsilon(L) = E \\frac{du}{dx}\\big|_{x=L}$, we obtain the boundary condition at $x=L$:\n$$\nAE \\frac{du}{dx}\\bigg|_{x=L} = P - k u(L)\n$$\nThis can be rewritten into the standard form of a mixed (or Robin) boundary condition:\n$$\nAE \\frac{du}{dx}\\bigg|_{x=L} + k u(L) = P\n$$\n\nWe now solve the boundary value problem, which consists of the ODE $\\frac{d^2u}{dx^2} = 0$ subject to the two boundary conditions.\nIntegrating the ODE twice with respect to $x$ gives the general solution for the displacement field:\n$$\n\\frac{du}{dx} = C_1\n$$\n$$\nu(x) = C_1 x + C_2\n$$\nwhere $C_1$ and $C_2$ are constants of integration determined by the boundary conditions.\nApplying the first boundary condition, $u(0)=0$:\n$$\nu(0) = C_1(0) + C_2 = 0 \\implies C_2 = 0\n$$\nThe solution simplifies to $u(x) = C_1 x$. The derivative is $\\frac{du}{dx} = C_1$.\nNow, we apply the second boundary condition at $x=L$:\n$$\nAE (C_1) + k (C_1 L) = P\n$$\nFactoring out $C_1$:\n$$\nC_1 (AE + k L) = P\n$$\nSolving for $C_1$:\n$$\nC_1 = \\frac{P}{AE + k L}\n$$\nSubstituting this constant back into the expression for $u(x)$, we obtain the final closed-form solution for the axial displacement:\n$$\nu(x) = \\frac{P x}{AE + k L}\n$$\n\nFinally, we examine the asymptotic behavior of this solution.\nCase 1: The limit of a vanishingly weak spring, $k \\to 0^{+}$.\nIn this limit, the solution becomes:\n$$\n\\lim_{k \\to 0^{+}} u(x) = \\lim_{k \\to 0^{+}} \\frac{P x}{AE + k L} = \\frac{P x}{AE}\n$$\nThe boundary condition at $x=L$ transforms as:\n$$\n\\lim_{k \\to 0^{+}} \\left( AE \\frac{du}{dx}\\bigg|_{x=L} + k u(L) = P \\right) \\implies AE \\frac{du}{dx}\\bigg|_{x=L} = P\n$$\nThis is a Neumann boundary condition, specifying that the internal force $A\\sigma(L)$ must equal the applied external force $P$. Our derived solution $u(x) = Px/(AE)$ correctly satisfies this, as $du/dx = P/(AE)$, and thus $AE (P/(AE)) = P$. This corresponds to the standard solution for a bar fixed at one end and subjected to an axial force at the other.\n\nCase 2: The limit of an infinitely stiff spring, $k \\to \\infty$.\nTo analyze this limit properly, we look at the displacement at the boundary, $u(L)$:\n$$\nu(L) = \\frac{P L}{AE + k L}\n$$\nAs $k \\to \\infty$, the denominator grows without bound, so:\n$$\n\\lim_{k \\to \\infty} u(L) = 0\n$$\nThis implies that for any finite $x \\in [0,L]$, the displacement $u(x) = \\frac{x}{L} u(L)$ also approaches zero:\n$$\n\\lim_{k \\to \\infty} u(x) = 0\n$$\nThe boundary condition at $x=L$ can be rewritten as $\\frac{AE}{k}\\frac{du}{dx}\\big|_{x=L} + u(L) = \\frac{P}{k}$. As $k \\to \\infty$, both $\\frac{AE}{k}$ and $\\frac{P}{k}$ tend to zero, and the condition reduces to:\n$$\nu(L) = 0\n$$\nThis is a Dirichlet boundary condition, representing a rigid fixture. The solution $u(x)=0$ for $x \\in [0,L]$ correctly describes a bar fixed at both ends ($u(0)=0$ and $u(L)=0$) with the force $P$ being applied directly at the fixed support at $x=L$. The force $P$ is transmitted entirely to the support at $x=L$, and the bar itself remains undeformed.\n\nThe derived solution for $u(x)$ thus correctly encapsulates the physics of the problem and smoothly transitions to the well-known simpler boundary models in the appropriate asymptotic limits.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\frac{P x}{E A + k L}}\n$$", "id": "2662862"}, {"introduction": "Moving from a specific model to a general principle, this exercise explores the profound consequences of symmetry in linear elasticity.

All premises are factually correct within the framework of continuum mechanics, and all terms are formally defined. The problem is self-contained and free of ambiguity. It is valid.\n\nSolution:\nThe problem requires the derivation of a reciprocal identity between two distinct elastostatic states, (A) and (B). This identity is a form of Betti's theorem. We will derive this from the fundamental principles provided.\n\nLet $\\sigma^{(\\mathrm{A})}_{ij}$ and $\\varepsilon^{(\\mathrm{A})}_{ij}$ be the stress and strain tensors for state A, and $\\sigma^{(\\mathrm{B})}_{ij}$ and $\\varepsilon^{(\\mathrm{B})}_{ij}$ be those for state B. The core of the reciprocal theorem lies in the symmetry of the work done by one state's stresses on the other state's strains.\n\nConsider the integral of the product of the stress tensor from state A and the strain tensor from state B over the domain $\\Omega$:\n$$ W_{\\mathrm{AB}} = \\int_{\\Omega} \\sigma^{(\\mathrm{A})}_{ij} \\varepsilon^{(\\mathrm{B})}_{ij} \\, dV $$\nSubstituting the constitutive relation $\\sigma^{(\\mathrm{A})}_{ij} = C_{ijkl}\\varepsilon^{(\\mathrm{A})}_{kl}$, we have:\n$$ W_{\\mathrm{AB}} = \\int_{\\Omega} C_{ijkl} \\varepsilon^{(\\mathrm{A})}_{kl} \\varepsilon^{(\\mathrm{B})}_{ij} \\, dV $$\nWe are given the major symmetry of the elasticity tensor, $C_{ijkl} = C_{klij}$. Applying this symmetry, we can write:\n$$ W_{\\mathrm{AB}} = \\int_{\\Omega} C_{klij} \\varepsilon^{(\\mathrm{A})}_{kl} \\varepsilon^{(\\mathrm{B})}_{ij} \\, dV $$\nThe expression $C_{klij} \\varepsilon^{(\\mathrm{A})}_{kl} \\varepsilon^{(\\mathrm{B})}_{ij}$ is a scalar, so we can reorder the terms: $\\varepsilon^{(\\mathrm{A})}_{kl} (C_{klij} \\varepsilon^{(\\mathrm{B})}_{ij})$. The term in parentheses is simply the stress tensor for state B, with indices $(k,l)$, since $\\sigma^{(\\mathrm{B})}_{kl} = C_{klrs} \\varepsilon^{(\\mathrm{B})}_{rs}$. So we have $\\varepsilon^{(\\mathrm{A})}_{kl} \\sigma^{(\\mathrm{B})}_{kl}$.\nTherefore, we have established the reciprocity of the internal virtual work:\n$$ \\int_{\\Omega} \\sigma^{(\\mathrm{A})}_{ij} \\varepsilon^{(\\mathrm{B})}_{ij} \\, dV = \\int_{\\Omega} \\sigma^{(\\mathrm{B})}_{ij} \\varepsilon^{(\\mathrm{A})}_{ij} \\, dV $$\n\nNext, we relate these volume integrals to work done by external forces on the boundary. Consider the left-hand side. Using the strain-displacement relation $\\varepsilon^{(\\mathrm{B})}_{ij} = \\tfrac{1}{2}(u^{(\\mathrm{B})}_{i,j} + u^{(\\mathrm{B})}_{j,i})$ and the symmetry of the stress tensor $\\sigma^{(\\mathrm{A})}_{ij} = \\sigma^{(\\mathrm{A})}_{ji}$:\n$$ \\int_{\\Omega} \\sigma^{(\\mathrm{A})}_{ij} \\varepsilon^{(\\mathrm{B})}_{ij} \\, dV = \\int_{\\Omega} \\sigma^{(\\mathrm{A})}_{ij} u^{(\\mathrm{B})}_{i,j} \\, dV $$\nUsing the product rule for differentiation, $(\\sigma^{(\\mathrm{A})}_{ij} u^{(\\mathrm{B})}_i)_{,j} = \\sigma^{(\\mathrm{A})}_{ij,j} u^{(\\mathrm{B})}_i + \\sigma^{(\\mathrm{A})}_{ij} u^{(\\mathrm{B})}_{i,j}$.\nThe equilibrium equation for state A is $\\sigma^{(\\mathrm{A})}_{ij,j} = 0$. Thus, $\\sigma^{(\\mathrm{A})}_{ij} u^{(\\mathrm{B})}_{i,j} = (\\sigma^{(\\mathrm{A})}_{ij} u^{(\\mathrm{B})}_i)_{,j}$.\nThe integral becomes:\n$$ \\int_{\\Omega} (\\sigma^{(\\mathrm{A})}_{ij} u^{(\\mathrm{B})}_i)_{,j} \\, dV $$\nBy applying the divergence theorem, this volume integral is converted to a surface integral over the boundary $\\Gamma$:\n$$ \\int_{\\Gamma} \\sigma^{(\\mathrm{A})}_{ij} u^{(\\mathrm{B})}_i n_j \\, dS $$\nwhere $n_j$ is the outward unit normal to the surface. The traction vector on the boundary for state A is defined as $t^{(\\mathrm{A})}_i = \\sigma^{(\\mathrm{A})}_{ij} n_j$. So the integral is the external work:\n$$ \\int_{\\Gamma} t^{(\\mathrm{A})}_i u^{(\\mathrm{B})}_i \\, dS $$\nBy performing the exact same steps for the right-hand side of our reciprocity relation (swapping A and B), we find:\n$$ \\int_{\\Omega} \\sigma^{(\\mathrm{B})}_{ij} \\varepsilon^{(\\mathrm{A})}_{ij} \\, dV = \\int_{\\Gamma} t^{(\\mathrm{B})}_i u^{(\\mathrm{A})}_i \\, dS $$\nEquating the two expressions for external work gives Betti's reciprocal theorem:\n$$ \\int_{\\Gamma} t^{(\\mathrm{A})}_i u^{(\\mathrm{B})}_i \\, dS = \\int_{\\Gamma} t^{(\\mathrm{B})}_i u^{(\\mathrm{A})}_i \\, dS $$\nNow we apply the specific boundary conditions of the problem. The boundary $\\Gamma$ is the union of $\\Gamma_u$ and $\\Gamma_t$.\nOn $\\Gamma_u$, we have $u^{(\\mathrm{A})}_i = 0$ and $u^{(\\mathrm{B})}_i = 0$.\nThe integrals over $\\Gamma$ can be split:\n$$ \\int_{\\Gamma_u} t^{(\\mathrm{A})}_i u^{(\\mathrm{B})}_i \\, dS + \\int_{\\Gamma_t} t^{(\\mathrm{A})}_i u^{(\\mathrm{B})}_i \\, dS = \\int_{\\Gamma_u} t^{(\\mathrm{B})}_i u^{(\\mathrm{A})}_i \\, dS + \\int_{\\Gamma_t} t^{(\\mathrm{B})}_i u^{(\\mathrm{A})}_i \\, dS $$\nDue to the zero displacement conditions on $\\Gamma_u$, the integrals over $\\Gamma_u$ vanish on both sides. We are left with:\n$$ \\int_{\\Gamma_t} t^{(\\mathrm{A})}_i u^{(\\mathrm{B})}_i \\, dS = \\int_{\\Gamma_t} t^{(\\mathrm{B})}_i u^{(\\mathrm{A})}_i \\, dS $$\nLet us evaluate the left-hand side. The traction for state A is given as $t^{(\\mathrm{A})}_i(x) = P\\,e_{k,i}\\,\\delta_{\\Gamma}(x-x_a)$, where $e_{k,i} = \\delta_{ik}$ is the Kronecker delta.\n$$ \\int_{\\Gamma_t} P\\,\\delta_{ik}\\,\\delta_{\\Gamma}(x-x_a) u^{(\\mathrm{B})}_i(x) \\, dS $$\nUsing the sifting property of the Dirac delta distribution $\\delta_{\\Gamma}$, this integral evaluates to:\n$$ P\\,\\delta_{ik}\\,u^{(\\mathrm{B})}_i(x_a) = P\\,u^{(\\mathrm{B})}_k(x_a) $$\nNow, let us evaluate the right-hand side.

These material properties are piecewise constant.\n\nThe displacement field $u(x)$ is found by integrating the strain from the clamped end at $x=0$, where the displacement is zero, i.e., $u(0)=0$.\n$$u(x) = \\int_0^x \\epsilon(\\xi) d\\xi$$\n\nFor Segment 1 ($x \\in [0, L_1]$):\nThe strain is $\\epsilon_1(x) = \\frac{s}{E_1} + \\alpha_1(T_1(x) - T_{\\mathrm{ref}})$.\nSubstituting the expression for $T_1(x)$:\n$$\\epsilon_1(x) = \\frac{s}{E_1} + \\alpha_1\\left(T_0 - \\frac{q}{k_1}x - T_{\\mathrm{ref}}\\right) = \\left(\\frac{s}{E_1} + \\alpha_1(T_0 - T_{\\mathrm{ref}})\\right) - \\frac{\\alpha_1q}{k_1}x$$\nThe displacement $u_1(x)$ is the integral from $0$ to $x$:\n$$u_1(x) = \\int_0^x \\left[ \\left(\\frac{s}{E_1} + \\alpha_1(T_0 - T_{\\mathrm{ref}})\\right) - \\frac{\\alpha_1q}{k_1}\\xi \\right] d\\xi$$\n$$u_1(x) = \\left(\\frac{s}{E_1} + \\alpha_1(T_0 - T_{\\mathrm{ref}})\\right)x - \\frac{\\alpha_1q}{2k_1}x^2$$\n\nFor Segment 2 ($x \\in [L_1, L]$):\nThe displacement $u_2(x)$ is the sum of the displacement at the interface, $u_1(L_1)$, and the additional displacement accumulated from $L_1$ to $x$:\n$$u_2(x) = u_1(L_1) + \\int_{L_1}^x \\epsilon_2(\\xi) d\\xi$$\nFirst, calculate the displacement at the interface $x=L_1$:\n$$u_1(L_1) = \\left(\\frac{s}{E_1} + \\alpha_1(T_0 - T_{\\mathrm{ref}})\\right)L_1 - \\frac{\\alpha_1q}{2k_1}L_1^2$$\nThe strain in segment 2 is $\\epsilon_2(x) = \\frac{s}{E_2} + \\alpha_2(T_2(x) - T_{\\mathrm{ref}})$. Using the convenient form for $T_2(x)$:\n$$\\epsilon_2(x) = \\frac{s}{E_2} + \\alpha_2\\left(\\left(T_0 - \\frac{qL_1}{k_1}\\right) - \\frac{q}{k_2}(x-L_1) - T_{\\mathrm{ref}}\\right)$$\nGroup the constant terms:\n$$\\epsilon_2(x) = \\left(\\frac{s}{E_2} + \\alpha_2\\left(T_0 - T_{\\mathrm{ref}} - \\frac{qL_1}{k_1}\\right)\\right) - \\frac{\\alpha_2q}{k_2}(x-L_1)$$\nNow, integrate this strain from $L_1$ to $x$:\n$$\\int_{L_1}^x \\epsilon_2(\\xi) d\\xi = \\int_{L_1}^x \\left[ \\left(\\frac{s}{E_2} + \\alpha_2\\left(T_0 - T_{\\mathrm{ref}} - \\frac{qL_1}{k_1}\\right)\\right) - \\frac{\\alpha_2q}{k_2}(\\xi-L_1) \\right] d\\xi$$\n$$= \\left(\\frac{s}{E_2} + \\alpha_2\\left(T_0 - T_{\\mathrm{ref}} - \\frac{qL_1}{k_1}\\right)\\right)(x-L_1) - \\frac{\\alpha_2q}{2k_2}(x-L_1)^2$$\nCombining results, the displacement in segment 2 is:\n$$u_2(x) = u_1(L_1) + \\left(\\frac{s}{E_2} + \\alpha_2\\left(T_0 - T_{\\mathrm{ref}} - \\frac{qL_1}{k_1}\\right)\\right)(x-L_1) - \\frac{\\alpha_2q}{2k_2}(x-L_1)^2$$\n\nSubstituting the expression for $u_1(L_1)$ gives the complete expression for $u_2(x)$.
