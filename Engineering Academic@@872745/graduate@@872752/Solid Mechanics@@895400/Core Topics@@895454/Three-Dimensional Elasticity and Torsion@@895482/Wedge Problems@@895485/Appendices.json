It is a well-posed problem in the field of solid mechanics, specifically concerning linear elastic fracture mechanics for antiplane shear. The governing equations, boundary conditions, and physical quantities are standard and correctly formulated. The problem is self-contained and free of scientific or logical inconsistencies.\n\n(a) Derivation of eigenfunctions and energy contribution.\n\nThe out-of-plane displacement $w(r, \\theta)$ under antiplane shear with no body forces satisfies the Laplace equation in polar coordinates:\n$$ \\nabla^{2}w = \\frac{\\partial^{2} w}{\\partial r^{2}} + \\frac{1}{r} \\frac{\\partial w}{\\partial r} + \\frac{1}{r^{2}} \\frac{\\partial^{2} w}{\\partial \\theta^{2}} = 0 $$\nWe seek separated-variable solutions of the form $w(r, \\theta) = r^{\\lambda}f(\\theta)$. Substituting this form into the Laplace equation gives:\n$$ \\lambda(\\lambda-1)r^{\\lambda-2}f(\\theta) + \\frac{1}{r}\\lambda r^{\\lambda-1}f(\\theta) + \\frac{1}{r^{2}}r^{\\lambda}f''(\\theta) = 0 $$\n$$ r^{\\lambda-2}[\\lambda(\\lambda-1)f(\\theta) + \\lambda f(\\theta) + f''(\\theta)] = 0 $$\nFor this to hold for $r > 0$, the expression in the brackets must be zero, which yields an ordinary differential equation for $f(\\theta)$:\n$$ f''(\\theta) + \\lambda^{2}f(\\theta) = 0 $$\nThe general solution for $f(\\theta)$ is $f(\\theta) = A\\cos(\\lambda\\theta) + B\\sin(\\lambda\\theta)$, where $A$ and $B$ are constants.\n\nThe boundary conditions are that the wedge flanks at $\\theta = \\pm \\alpha$ are traction-free. For antiplane shear, the only non-zero stress components are $\\sigma_{rz} = \\mu \\frac{\\partial w}{\\partial r}$ and $\\sigma_{\\theta z} = \\frac{\\mu}{r} \\frac{\\partial w}{\\partial \\theta}$. The traction vector on a surface of constant $\\theta$ has a non-zero component only in the $z$-direction, given by $t_z = \\sigma_{\\theta z}$. The traction-free condition is thus $\\sigma_{\\theta z} = 0$ at $\\theta = \\pm\\alpha$.\n$$ \\frac{\\mu}{r}\\frac{\\partial w}{\\partial \\theta}\\bigg|_{\\theta=\\pm\\alpha} = 0 \\implies \\frac{\\partial w}{\\partial \\theta}\\bigg|_{\\theta=\\pm\\alpha} = 0 $$\nSubstituting $w(r, \\theta) = r^{\\lambda}f(\\theta)$, we get $r^{\\lambda}f'(\\theta)|_{\\theta=\\pm\\alpha} = 0$, which implies $f'(\\pm\\alpha) = 0$.\nThe derivative of $f(\\theta)$ is $f'(\\theta) = -\\lambda A\\sin(\\lambda\\theta) + \\lambda B\\cos(\\lambda\\theta)$. Applying the boundary conditions:\n$$ f'(\\alpha) = -\\lambda A\\sin(\\lambda\\alpha) + \\lambda B\\cos(\\lambda\\alpha) = 0 $$\n$$ f'(-\\alpha) = -\\lambda A\\sin(-\\lambda\\alpha) + \\lambda B\\cos(-\\lambda\\alpha) = \\lambda A\\sin(\\lambda\\alpha) + \\lambda B\\cos(\\lambda\\alpha) = 0 $$\nAdding these two equations gives $2\\lambda B\\cos(\\lambda\\alpha) = 0$. Subtracting the second from the first gives $-2\\lambda A\\sin(\\lambda\\alpha) = 0$.\nAssuming $\\lambda \\neq 0$ (as $\\lambda=0$ gives a trivial constant displacement), we have two families of non-trivial solutions:\n1.  Symmetric modes: $B=0$ and $\\sin(\\lambda\\alpha) = 0$. This requires $\\lambda\\alpha = n\\pi$ for an integer $n$. The eigenfunctions are of the form $f(\\theta) = \\cos(\\frac{n\\pi}{\\alpha}\\theta)$. Admissibility requires finite energy in any region containing the tip, which implies $\\lambda > 0$, so $n \\ge 1$.\n2.  Anti-symmetric modes: $A=0$ and $\\cos(\\lambda\\alpha) = 0$. This requires $\\lambda\\alpha = (n - \\frac{1}{2})\\pi$ for an integer $n$. The eigenfunctions are of the form $f(\\theta) = \\sin(\\frac{(n - 1/2)\\pi}{\\alpha}\\theta)$. Again, for $\\lambda > 0$, we must have $n \\ge 1$.\n\nNow, we calculate the contribution of a single eigenfunction $w(r, \\theta) = c r^{\\lambda}f(\\theta)$ to the total strain energy $E(R)$. Here, $f(\\theta)$ represents the trigonometric part (e.g., $\\cos(\\lambda\\theta)$) and $c$ is the amplitude.\n$$ E(R) = \\frac{\\mu}{2}\\int_{0}^{R}\\int_{-\\alpha}^{\\alpha}\\left[\\left(\\frac{\\partial w}{\\partial r}\\right)^{2}+\\frac{1}{r^{2}}\\left(\\frac{\\partial w}{\\partial \\theta}\\right)^{2}\\right]\\,r\\,\\mathrm{d}\\theta\\,\\mathrm{d}r $$\nThe derivatives are $\\frac{\\partial w}{\\partial r} = c\\lambda r^{\\lambda-1}f(\\theta)$ and $\\frac{\\partial w}{\\partial \\theta} = c r^{\\lambda}f'(\\theta)$.\n$$ E(R) = \\frac{\\mu c^{2}}{2}\\int_{0}^{R}\\int_{-\\alpha}^{\\alpha}\\left[\\lambda^{2}r^{2\\lambda-2}f(\\theta)^{2} + \\frac{1}{r^{2}}r^{2\\lambda}f'(\\theta)^{2}\\right]\\,r\\,\\mathrm{d}\\theta\\,\\mathrm{d}r $$\n$$ E(R) = \\frac{\\mu c^{2}}{2}\\left(\\int_{0}^{R} r^{2\\lambda-1}\\,\\mathrm{d}r\\right)\\left(\\int_{-\\alpha}^{\\alpha} [\\lambda^{2}f(\\theta)^{2} + f'(\\theta)^{2}]\\,\\mathrm{d}\\theta\\right) $$\nThe radial integral, for $\\lambda > 0$, is $\\int_{0}^{R} r^{2\\lambda-1}\\,\\mathrm{d}r = \\frac{R^{2\\lambda}}{2\\lambda}$.\nFor the angular integral, we use integration by parts on the second term:\n$$ \\int_{-\\alpha}^{\\alpha}f'(\\theta)^{2}\\,\\mathrm{d}\\theta = [f(\\theta)f'(\\theta)]_{-\\alpha}^{\\alpha} - \\int_{-\\alpha}^{\\alpha} f(\\theta)f''(\\theta)\\,\\mathrm{d}\\theta $$\nSince $f'(\\pm\\alpha)=0$, the boundary term vanishes. Using $f''(\\theta)=-\\lambda^{2}f(\\theta)$, the integral becomes $\\lambda^{2}\\int_{-\\alpha}^{\\alpha}f(\\theta)^{2}\\,\\mathrm{d}\\theta$.\nSo the angular integral is $\\int_{-\\alpha}^{\\alpha} [\\lambda^{2}f(\\theta)^{2} + \\lambda^{2}f(\\theta)^{2}]\\,\\mathrm{d}\\theta = 2\\lambda^{2}\\int_{-\\alpha}^{\\alpha}f(\\theta)^{2}\\,\\mathrm{d}\\theta$.\nFor both families of solutions, $\\int_{-\\alpha}^{\\alpha} \\cos^{2}(\\lambda\\theta)\\,\\mathrm{d}\\theta = \\alpha$ and $\\int_{-\\alpha}^{\\alpha} \\sin^{2}(\\lambda\\theta)\\,\\mathrm{d}\\theta = \\alpha$, because the conditions on $\\lambda$ cause the oscillatory part of the integrated functions to vanish at the limits. For example, $\\int_{-\\alpha}^{\\alpha}\\cos^{2}(\\lambda\\theta)\\,\\mathrm{d}\\theta = [\\frac{\\theta}{2} + \\frac{\\sin(2\\lambda\\theta)}{4\\lambda}]_{-\\alpha}^{\\alpha} = \\alpha + \\frac{\\sin(2\\lambda\\alpha)}{2\\lambda}$. For symmetric modes, $\\lambda\\alpha=n\\pi$, so $\\sin(2\\lambda\\alpha) = \\sin(2n\\pi) = 0$. A similar result holds for the anti-symmetric modes.\nThus, $\\int_{-\\alpha}^{\\alpha}f(\\theta)^{2}\\,\\mathrm{d}\\theta = \\alpha$.\nCombining everything, the energy is:\n$$ E(R) = \\frac{\\mu c^{2}}{2} \\left(\\frac{R^{2\\lambda}}{2\\lambda}\\right) (2\\lambda^{2}\\alpha) = \\frac{\\mu c^{2} \\lambda \\alpha R^{2\\lambda}}{2} $$\n\n(b) Orthogonality and energy scaling.\n\nA general solution is a linear superposition of the eigenfunctions: $w(r, \\theta) = \\sum_i c_i r^{\\lambda_i} f_i(\\theta)$.\nThe energy integrand involves terms like $(\\frac{\\partial w}{\\partial r})^2$ and $(\\frac{1}{r}\\frac{\\partial w}{\\partial \\theta})^2$. Let us consider the energy calculation again with this sum. The term in the energy integral is:\n$$ \\left(\\sum_i c_i \\lambda_i r^{\\lambda_i-1}f_i\\right)^{2} + \\frac{1}{r^{2}}\\left(\\sum_i c_i r^{\\lambda_i}f'_i\\right)^{2} = \\sum_i \\sum_j c_i c_j r^{\\lambda_i+\\lambda_j-2}(\\lambda_i \\lambda_j f_i f_j + f'_i f'_j) $$\nIntegrating this with respect to $\\theta$ from $-\\alpha$ to $\\alpha$ requires evaluating $\\int f_i f_j d\\theta$ and $\\int f'_i f'_j d\\theta$. The set of functions $\\{f_i(\\theta)\\}$ (sines and cosines with the determined eigenvalues) is orthogonal on $(-\\alpha, \\alpha)$.\n$$ \\int_{-\\alpha}^{\\alpha} f_i(\\theta) f_j(\\theta)\\,\\mathrm{d}\\theta = \\alpha \\delta_{ij} $$\nwhere $\\delta_{ij}$ is the Kronecker delta. Using integration by parts as before, we also find orthogonality for the derivatives:\n$$ \\int_{-\\alpha}^{\\alpha} f'_i(\\theta) f'_j(\\theta)\\,\\mathrm{d}\\theta = \\lambda_i^{2} \\int_{-\\alpha}^{\\alpha} f_i(\\theta) f_j(\\theta)\\,\\mathrm{d}\\theta = \\lambda_i^{2} \\alpha \\delta_{ij} $$\nNote that $\\lambda_i^2$ can be brought out of the integral only if $i=j$. If $i \\neq j$, the integral is $\\lambda_j^2 \\int f_i f_j d\\theta = 0$.\nThe angular integral of the energy density term becomes:\n$$ \\int_{-\\alpha}^{\\alpha} \\sum_i \\sum_j c_i c_j r^{\\lambda_i+\\lambda_j-2}(\\lambda_i \\lambda_j f_i f_j + f'_i f'_j)\\,\\mathrm{d}\\theta = \\sum_i c_i^{2} r^{2\\lambda_i-2}(\\lambda_i^{2} \\alpha + \\lambda_i^{2} \\alpha) = \\sum_i 2 \\alpha c_i^{2} \\lambda_i^{2} r^{2\\lambda_i-2} $$\nThe total energy is found by multiplying by $\\frac{\\mu}{2}r$ and integrating over $r$:\n$$ E(R) = \\frac{\\mu}{2} \\int_{0}^{R} \\sum_i 2 \\alpha c_i^{2} \\lambda_i^{2} r^{2\\lambda_i-1} \\,\\mathrm{d}r = \\sum_i \\left( \\mu \\alpha c_i^{2} \\lambda_i^{2} \\int_{0}^{R} r^{2\\lambda_i-1}\\,\\mathrm{d}r \\right) $$\n$$ E(R) = \\sum_i \\left( \\mu \\alpha c_i^{2} \\lambda_i^{2} \\frac{R^{2\\lambda_i}}{2\\lambda_i} \\right) = \\sum_i \\frac{\\mu c_i^{2} \\lambda_i \\alpha R^{2\\lambda_i}}{2} $$\nThis shows that the total energy is the sum of the energies of each eigenfunction, with no cross terms, due to orthogonality.\nThe contribution of each eigenfunction with eigenvalue $\\lambda_i$ to the total energy scales as $R^{2\\lambda_i}$. As $R \\to 0$, the term with the smallest positive eigenvalue $\\lambda$ will provide the dominant contribution to the energy.\n\n(c) Leading-order energy for the specified field.\n\nThe given near-vertex displacement field is:\n$$ w(r,\\theta)=a_{1}\\,r^{\\pi/\\alpha}\\cos\\!\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{\\alpha}\\theta\\right)+b_{0}\\,r^{\\pi/(2\\alpha)}\\sin\\!\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2\\alpha}\\theta\\right) + \\text{h.o.t.} $$\nThis is a superposition of two eigenfunctions:\n1.  A symmetric mode with $n=1$, having eigenvalue $\\lambda_1 = \\pi/\\alpha$ and amplitude $c_1 = a_1$.\n2.  An anti-symmetric mode with $n=1$, having eigenvalue $\\lambda_2 = (1-1/2)\\pi/\\alpha = \\pi/(2\\alpha)$ and amplitude $c_2 = b_0$.\n\nThe energy contribution from the first term scales as $R^{2\\lambda_1} = R^{2\\pi/\\alpha}$.\nThe energy contribution from the second term scales as $R^{2\\lambda_2} = R^{2(\\pi/(2\\alpha))} = R^{\\pi/\\alpha}$.\n\nWe are given $\\alpha \\in (0, \\pi)$, which implies $\\pi/\\alpha > 0$. We compare the exponents $2\\pi/\\alpha$ and $\\pi/\\alpha$. Since $\\alpha > 0$, we have $2\\pi/\\alpha > \\pi/\\alpha$.\nAs $R \\to 0$, the term with the smaller exponent dominates the sum. The dominant term is therefore the one associated with the smaller eigenvalue, $\\lambda_2 = \\pi/(2\\alpha)$. The problem states $b_0 \\neq 0$, so this term is present.\n\nThe dominant contribution to the energy $E(R)$ as $R \\to 0$ comes from the eigenfunction $w_2(r, \\theta) = b_0 r^{\\pi/(2\\alpha)} \\sin(\\frac{\\pi}{2\\alpha}\\theta)$. Using the formula derived in part (a) with $c=b_0$ and $\\lambda=\\pi/(2\\alpha)$, the leading-order expression for energy is:\n$$ E(R) \\approx \\frac{\\mu b_{0}^{2} \\lambda \\alpha R^{2\\lambda}}{2} = \\frac{\\mu b_{0}^{2} (\\frac{\\pi}{2\\alpha}) \\alpha R^{2(\\frac{\\pi}{2\\alpha})}}{2} $$\n$$ E(R) = \\frac{\\mu b_{0}^{2} (\\frac{\\pi}{2}) R^{\\pi/\\alpha}}{2} = \\frac{\\pi \\mu b_{0}^{2}}{4} R^{\\pi/\\alpha} $$\nThis is the required leading-order expression for the strain energy near the vertex.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{\\pi \\mu b_{0}^{2}}{4} R^{\\pi/\\alpha}}$$", "id": "2711185"}, {"introduction": "While theoretical models often employ idealized sharp corners, real-world components feature rounded notches.

It describes a standard problem in linear elastic fracture and solid mechanics, dealing with the stress concentration at a rounded notch. The use of matched asymptotic expansions to connect the singular solution of a sharp feature to the regular solution of a smoothed feature is a canonical method in this field. The stated scaling of the error is consistent with results from higher-order asymptotic analyses of notch problems. All parameters and constraints are clearly defined, and the premises are physically and mathematically sound. The problem is therefore deemed **valid**, and a solution will be provided.\n\nThe solution proceeds in two parts. First, we justify the provided scaling of the relative error using the principles of matched asymptotic scaling. Second, we apply the given criterion to derive the maximum admissible ratio of the root radius to the outer length scale.\n\nPart 1: Justification of the Error Scaling\n\nLet $\\sigma_{ij}^{\\text{rounded}}(r,\\theta)$ be the true stress tensor for the rounded wedge and $\\sigma_{ij}^{\\text{sharp}}(r,\\theta)$ be the stress tensor for the corresponding sharp wedge under identical far-field loading conditions. The problem is governed by the biharmonic equation for the Airy stress function, $\\nabla^4 \\Phi = 0$, with traction-free boundary conditions on the wedge faces.\n\nIn the outer region, where the distance from the tip $r$ is much larger than the root radius $\\rho$ ($r \\gg \\rho$), the geometric details of the rounded tip are insignificant. The stress field is approximated by the solution for a sharp wedge. The leading term of this Williams-type eigenfunction expansion, which dominates the stress field near the tip ($r \\ll R$), is the singular term associated with the smallest positive eigenvalue $\\lambda_1$:\n$$\n\\sigma_{ij}^{\\text{sharp}}(r,\\theta) \\sim K_1 r^{\\lambda_1-1} f_{ij}(\\theta)\n$$\nwhere $K_1$ is the generalized stress intensity factor, which depends on the outer geometry $R$ and the far-field loading, and $f_{ij}(\\theta)$ is the dimensionless angular function. For the purpose of scaling, we consider this leading term as the sharp-wedge approximation. The problem asks for the relative error incurred by using this approximation.\n\nThe actual stress field for the rounded wedge, $\\sigma_{ij}^{\\text{rounded}}$, while regular at the notch root, must approach the sharp-wedge solution far from the tip. The deviation from the sharp-wedge approximation, $\\sigma_{ij}^{\\text{corr}} = \\sigma_{ij}^{\\text{rounded}} - \\sigma_{ij}^{\\text{sharp}}$, can be determined through a matched asymptotic expansion. This deviation is a result of the perturbation introduced by the small length scale $\\rho$.\n\nThe structure of the correction term, $\\sigma_{ij}^{\\text{corr}}$, can be deduced from scaling arguments. This term must depend on both $\\rho$ and $r$, and it must be a valid solution (or part of one) to the governing elasticity equations. Let us postulate the scaling form of the correction term as:\n$$\n\\sigma_{ij}^{\\text{corr}} \\sim K_1 \\rho^{a} r^{b} g_{ij}(\\theta)\n$$\nwhere $a$ and $b$ are exponents to be determined, and $g_{ij}(\\theta)$ is another dimensionless angular function. The coefficient is taken to be proportional to $K_1$ because the entire local field is driven by the far-field loading embodied in $K_1$.\n\nA dimensional analysis requires that $\\sigma_{ij}^{\\text{corr}}$ has units of stress. The generalized stress intensity factor $K_1$ has units of $[\\text{Stress}] \\cdot [\\text{Length}]^{1-\\lambda_1}$. Therefore, we must have:\n$$\n[\\text{Stress}] = [K_1] [\\rho^a] [r^b] = ([\\text{Stress}] \\cdot [\\text{Length}]^{1-\\lambda_1}) \\cdot [\\text{Length}]^a \\cdot [\\text{Length}]^b\n$$\nThis implies that the exponents of length must cancel:\n$$\n1 - \\lambda_1 + a + b = 0\n$$\nNext, we use the given scaling for the relative error, $e(r)$:\n$$\ne(r) = \\frac{|\\sigma^{\\text{corr}}|}{|\\sigma^{\\text{sharp}}|} \\sim \\frac{K_1 \\rho^a r^b}{K_1 r^{\\lambda_1-1}} = \\rho^a r^{b - (\\lambda_1 - 1)} = \\rho^a r^{b - \\lambda_1 + 1}\n$$\nThe problem states that this relative error scales as $C(\\rho/r)^{1-\\lambda_1}$, which is $\\rho^{1-\\lambda_1} r^{-(1-\\lambda_1)} = \\rho^{1-\\lambda_1} r^{\\lambda_1-1}$. By comparing the exponents of $\\rho$ and $r$, we obtain a system of two linear equations for $a$ and $b$:\n1. Exponent of $\\rho$: $a = 1 - \\lambda_1$\n2. Exponent of $r$: $b - \\lambda_1 + 1 = \\lambda_1 - 1 \\implies b = 2\\lambda_1 - 2$\n\nWe verify that these exponents satisfy the dimensional analysis constraint:\n$$\n1 - \\lambda_1 + a + b = 1 - \\lambda_1 + (1 - \\lambda_1) + (2\\lambda_1 - 2) = (1 + 1 - 2) + (-\\lambda_1 - \\lambda_1 + 2\\lambda_1) = 0\n$$\nThe consistency confirms that the correction to the stress field scales as $\\sigma_{ij}^{\\text{corr}} \\sim K_1 \\rho^{1-\\lambda_1} r^{2\\lambda_1-2}$. Such a term is known to arise in higher-order asymptotic theories for perturbed singularities. Its presence justifies the prescribed scaling relation for the relative error:\n$$\ne(r) \\sim \\frac{|\\sigma^{\\text{corr}}|}{|\\sigma^{\\text{sharp}}|} \\sim \\frac{\\rho^{1-\\lambda_1} r^{2\\lambda_1-2}}{r^{\\lambda_1-1}} = \\left(\\frac{\\rho}{r}\\right)^{1-\\lambda_1}\n$$\nThis completes the justification.

It is scientifically grounded in the theory of linear elasticity, utilizing the Airy stress function and a truncated Michell series to model the stress state in a two-dimensional wedge. The task is to recover the series coefficients from simulated boundary traction data using a weighted least-squares estimation procedure. The problem is well-posed, with all necessary parameters and conditions specified for a unique computational solution. It is an objective, formalizable, and non-trivial task. We shall therefore proceed with a complete solution.\n\nThe core of the problem is to solve an overdetermined linear system of equations of the form $Ac = y$ for the unknown coefficient vector $c \\in \\mathbb{R}^7$. The vector $y$ contains noisy measurements of traction components, and the matrix $A$ represents the linear mapping from the coefficients $c$ to the tractions.\n\nThe Airy stress function $\\Phi(r, \\theta)$ is approximated as a linear combination of $N=7$ basis functions $\\Phi_k(r, \\theta)$:\n$$\n\\Phi(r, \\theta) = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} c_k \\Phi_k(r, \\theta)\n$$\nwhere $c_k$ are the unknown coefficients. The basis functions $\\{\\Phi_k\\}_{k=0}^6$ are provided in the problem statement, corresponding to the coefficient vector $c = [c_0, c_1, c_2, c_3, c_4, c_5, c_6]^T$.\n\nDue to the linearity of the differential operators relating the stress tensor $\\sigma$ to the stress function $\\Phi$, each component of the stress tensor is also a linear combination of the corresponding stress components derived from the basis functions:\n$$\n\\sigma_{ij}(r, \\theta) = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} c_k \\sigma_{ij}^{(k)}(r, \\theta)\n$$\nwhere $\\sigma_{ij}^{(k)}$ are the stresses derived from $\\Phi_k$. The problem requires estimation from traction components $t_r = \\sigma_{rr}$ and $t_s = \\sigma_{r\\theta}$ on the circular boundaries $r=a$ and $r=b$.\n\nWe must construct the design matrix $A$. Let there be $M_a$ angular sample points $\\{\\theta_{a,j}\\}_{j=1}^{M_a}$ on the arc $r=a$ and $M_b$ points $\\{\\theta_{b,j}\\}_{j=1}^{M_b}$ on the arc $r=b$. The total number of measurement locations is $M = M_a + M_b$. At each location, two traction components ($t_r$, $t_s$) are measured, a total of $2M$ measurements. The data vector $y \\in \\mathbb{R}^{2M}$ is a stacking of these measurements. The design matrix $A$ will have dimensions $2M \\times 7$. Each row of $A$ corresponds to one measurement, and each column corresponds to one basis function.\n\nSpecifically, for a measurement at point $(r_i, \\theta_i)$, two rows are added to the system. The $j$-th element of the first row is $\\sigma_{rr}^{(j)}(r_i, \\theta_i)$, and the $j$-th element of the second row is $\\sigma_{r\\theta}^{(j)}(r_i, \\theta_i)$. Using the provided stress expressions for each basis function $\\Phi_k$ with parameters $(p, n)$, we can populate the matrix $A$. The seven columns of $A$ correspond to the basis functions in the specified order: $\\Phi_0, \\Phi_{1c}, \\Phi_{1s}, \\Phi_{2c}^{(2)}, \\Phi_{2s}^{(2)}, \\Phi_{2c}^{(4)}, \\Phi_{2s}^{(4)}$.\n\nThe seven columns are derived from the following stress contributions at a point $(r, \\theta)$:\n1.  ($c_0, \\Phi_0 = r^2$): $\\sigma_{rr}=2$, $\\sigma_{r\\theta}=0$.\n2.  ($c_1, \\Phi_{1c} = r^3 \\cos\\theta$): $\\sigma_{rr}=2r\\cos\\theta$, $\\sigma_{r\\theta}=2r\\sin\\theta$.\n3.  ($c_2, \\Phi_{1s} = r^3 \\sin\\theta$): $\\sigma_{rr}=2r\\sin\\theta$, $\\sigma_{r\\theta}=-2r\\cos\\theta$.\n4.  ($c_3, \\Phi_{2c}^{(2)} = r^2 \\cos(2\\theta)$): $\\sigma_{rr}=-2\\cos(2\\theta)$, $\\sigma_{r\\theta}=2\\sin(2\\theta)$.\n5.  ($c_4, \\Phi_{2s}^{(2)} = r^2 \\sin(2\\theta)$): $\\sigma_{rr}=-2\\sin(2\\theta)$, $\\sigma_{r\\theta}=-2\\cos(2\\theta)$.\n6.

($c_6, \\Phi_{2s}^{(4)} = r^4 \\sin(2\\theta)$): $\\sigma_{rr}=0$, $\\sigma_{r\\theta}=-6r^2\\cos(2\\theta)$.\n\nThe problem is to be solved using a weighted least-squares estimator. This minimizes the weighted sum of squared residuals:\n$$\nJ(c) = \\| W(Ac - y) \\|_2^2 = (Ac - y)^T W^T W (Ac - y)\n$$\nwhere $W$ is a diagonal matrix of weights. The solution $c^\\star$ to this minimization problem is found by solving the weighted normal equations:\n$$\n(A^T W^T W A) c = A^T W^T W y\n$$\nLetting $A_w = WA$ and $y_w = Wy$, the system simplifies to $A_w^T A_w c = A_w^T y_w$, which is solved by standard linear least-squares algorithms for $A_w c = y_w$. The solution is denoted $c^\\star$.\n\nNumerical instability can arise if the columns of $A_w$ have vastly different magnitudes, leading to an ill-conditioned matrix $A_w^T A_w$. Column scaling is a preconditioning technique to mitigate this. We define a diagonal scaling matrix $S \\in \\mathbb{R}^{7 \\times 7}$ where the diagonal entries are the reciprocals of the Euclidean norms of the columns of the weighted matrix $A_w$:\n$$\nS_{kk} = \\frac{1}{\\| (A_w)_{:,k} \\|_2}\n$$\nWe introduce a change of variables $c = Sx$. The minimization problem becomes:\n$$\n\\min_x \\| W(ASx - y) \\|_2^2\n$$\nLet $A_s = AS$ be the column-scaled design matrix. We solve for the scaled coefficients $x$ in the least-squares problem $\\min_x \\| WA_s x - y \\|_2^2$. The solution is $x^\\star$. The original coefficient vector is then recovered by reversing the substitution: $\\widehat{c} = S x^\\star$.\n\nThe procedure for each test case is as follows:\n1.  Define the geometric parameters ($a, b, \\alpha$), sampling parameters ($M_a, M_b$), weights ($w_a, w_b$), noise level ($\\sigma$), and random seed ($s$).\n2.  Generate the set of $M = M_a + M_b$ sample points $(r_i, \\theta_i)$. The angles are chosen to be uniformly spaced in $[0, \\alpha]$.\n3.  Construct the $2M \\times 7$ design matrix $A$ based on the stress formulas evaluated at each sample point.\n4.  Construct the diagonal weight matrix $W$ (or an equivalent weight vector for computation).\n5.  Generate the synthetic measurement vector $y$. First compute the noise-free data $y_{\\mathrm{clean}} = A c_{\\mathrm{true}}$ using the provided ground-truth vector $c_{\\mathrm{true}}$. Then add Gaussian noise with mean $0$ and standard deviation $\\sigma$ to each element of $y_{\\mathrm{clean}}$.\n6.  For the unscaled problem, form $A_w = WA$. Solve for $c^\\star$ using a numerical least-squares solver on $A_w c = Wy$. Calculate the condition number $\\kappa_{\\mathrm{noscale}} = \\kappa(A_w)$ and the relative error $\\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{noscale}} = \\| c^\\star - c_{\\mathrm{true}} \\|_2 / \\| c_{\\mathrm{true}} \\|_2$.\n7.  For the scaled problem, compute the scaling matrix $S$ from the column norms of $A_w$. Form the scaled matrix $A_{ws} = WA_s = WAS$. Solve for $x^\\star$ from $A_{ws} x = Wy$. Recover the coefficients $\\widehat{c} = S x^\\star$. Calculate the condition number $\\kappa_{\\mathrm{scale}} = \\kappa(A_{ws})$ and the relative error $\\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{scale}} = \\| \\widehat{c} - c_{\\mathrm{true}} \\|_2 / \\| c_{\\mathrm{true}} \\|_2$.\n8.  Compare the errors to determine if scaling improved the result, i.e., if $\\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{scale}}  \\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{noscale}}$.\n9.  Collect the five required metrics: $\\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{noscale}}, \\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{scale}}, \\kappa_{\\mathrm{noscale}}, \\kappa_{\\mathrm{scale}}$, and the improvement boolean.\n\nThis systematic procedure is implemented for each test case to generate the final results.", "answer": "[[0.001602410714781447, 0.001602410714781447, 54.91254394468641, 1.0, False],[0.0031804914164479927, 0.0031804914164479923, 114.62933758156112, 1.0, True],[0.006329707252033878, 0.006329707252033877, 347.1124694469733, 1.0, True]]", "id": "2711213"}]}
