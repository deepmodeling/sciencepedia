It is self-contained, scientifically grounded, and well-posed. The validation is affirmative, and I will proceed with the solution.\n\nThe problem requires a solution for the torsion of a prismatic bar with a circular cross-section using Saint-Venant's semi-inverse method. The bar has a radius $a$ and is subjected to end torques $T$. The longitudinal axis is the $z$-axis.\n\nFirst, we establish the displacement field. Following Saint-Venant's hypothesis for pure torsion, the displacement of a point $(x,y,z)$ is assumed to be composed of a rigid rotation of the cross-section about the $z$-axis, proportional to the distance $z$ from one end, and a longitudinal displacement or \"warping\" that is independent of $z$. For a small angle of twist per unit length, $\\alpha$, the displacement components $(u_x, u_y, u_z)$ are:\n$$\nu_x = -\\alpha z y \\\\\nu_y = \\alpha z x \\\\\nu_z = \\psi(x,y)\n$$\nHere, $\\psi(x,y)$ is the warping function, which describes the out-of-plane deformation of the cross-section.\n\nNext, we compute the components of the infinitesimal strain tensor, $\\varepsilon_{ij} = \\frac{1}{2}(\\frac{\\partial u_i}{\\partial x_j} + \\frac{\\partial u_j}{\\partial x_i})$.\n$$\n\\varepsilon_{xx} = \\frac{\\partial u_x}{\\partial x} = 0 \\\\\n\\varepsilon_{yy} = \\frac{\\partial u_y}{\\partial y} = 0 \\\\\n\\varepsilon_{zz} = \\frac{\\partial u_z}{\\partial z} = \\frac{\\partial \\psi(x,y)}{\\partial z} = 0 \\\\\n\\varepsilon_{xy} = \\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\frac{\\partial u_x}{\\partial y} + \\frac{\\partial u_y}{\\partial x}\\right) = \\frac{1}{2}(-\\alpha z + \\alpha z) = 0\n$$\nThe only non-vanishing strain components are the shear strains related to the $z$-direction:\n$$\n\\varepsilon_{xz} = \\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\frac{\\partial u_x}{\\partial z} + \\frac{\\partial u_z}{\\partial x}\\right) = \\frac{1}{2}\\left(-\\alpha y + \\frac{\\partial \\psi}{\\partial x}\\right) \\\\\n\\varepsilon_{yz} = \\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\frac{\\partial u_y}{\\partial z} + \\frac{\\partial u_z}{\\partial y}\\right) = \\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\alpha x + \\frac{\\partial \\psi}{\\partial y}\\right)\n$$\n\nFor a homogeneous, isotropic, linearly elastic material, Hooke's law relates stress $\\sigma_{ij}$ to strain $\\varepsilon_{ij}$. As all normal strain components and $\\varepsilon_{xy}$ are zero, the trace of the strain tensor $\\varepsilon_{kk} = \\varepsilon_{xx} + \\varepsilon_{yy} + \\varepsilon_{zz} = 0$. Consequently, all normal stress components $\\sigma_{xx}, \\sigma_{yy}, \\sigma_{zz}$ are zero, and the shear stress $\\sigma_{xy}$ is also zero. The only non-zero stress components are:\n$$\n\\sigma_{xz} = 2G\\varepsilon_{xz} = G\\left(\\frac{\\partial \\psi}{\\partial x} - \\alpha y\\right) \\\\\n\\sigma_{yz} = 2G\\varepsilon_{yz} = G\\left(\\frac{\\partial \\psi}{\\partial y} + \\alpha x\\right)\n$$\nwhere $G$ is the shear modulus.\n\nThese stress components must satisfy the equations of equilibrium, $\\frac{\\partial \\sigma_{ij}}{\\partial x_j} = 0$, in the absence of body forces. The first two equilibrium equations (in the $x$ and $y$ directions) are satisfied identically since all stress components are independent of $z$. The third equilibrium equation (in the $z$ direction) is:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial \\sigma_{xz}}{\\partial x} + \\frac{\\partial \\sigma_{yz}}{\\partial y} + \\frac{\\partial \\sigma_{zz}}{\\partial z} = 0\n$$\nSubstituting the expressions for the stresses:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}\\left[G\\left(\\frac{\\partial \\psi}{\\partial x} - \\alpha y\\right)\\right] + \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}\\left[G\\left(\\frac{\\partial \\psi}{\\partial y} + \\alpha x\\right)\\right] = 0\n$$\nAs $G$ and $\\alpha$ are constants, this simplifies to:\n$$\nG\\left(\\frac{\\partial^2 \\psi}{\\partial x^2} - 0\\right) + G\\left(\\frac{\\partial^2 \\psi}{\\partial y^2} + 0\\right) = 0\n$$\nThis yields Laplace's equation for the warping function over the cross-sectional domain $\\mathcal{D}$:\n$$\n\\nabla^2 \\psi = \\frac{\\partial^2 \\psi}{\\partial x^2} + \\frac{\\partial^2 \\psi}{\\partial y^2} = 0 \\quad \\text{for } (x,y) \\in \\mathcal{D}\n$$\n\nThe boundary condition is that the lateral surface of the bar is traction-free. The traction vector on this surface is given by $\\boldsymbol{t} = \\boldsymbol{\\sigma} \\boldsymbol{n}$, where $\\boldsymbol{n}$ is the outward unit normal vector to the boundary curve $\\partial\\mathcal{D}$. For the component of traction along the $z$-axis, we must have $t_z = 0$.\n$$\nt_z = \\sigma_{xz} n_x + \\sigma_{yz} n_y = 0\n$$\nFor a circular cross-section of radius $a$, the boundary is the circle $x^2 + y^2 = a^2$, and the outward unit normal has components $n_x = x/a$ and $n_y = y/a$. Substituting this and the stress expressions into the boundary condition gives:\n$$\nG\\left(\\frac{\\partial \\psi}{\\partial x} - \\alpha y\\right)\\frac{x}{a} + G\\left(\\frac{\\partial \\psi}{\\partial y} + \\alpha x\\right)\\frac{y}{a} = 0\n$$\n$$\n\\left(\\frac{\\partial \\psi}{\\partial x}\\right)x - \\alpha yx + \\left(\\frac{\\partial \\psi}{\\partial y}\\right)y + \\alpha xy = 0\n$$\n$$\nx\\frac{\\partial \\psi}{\\partial x} + y\\frac{\\partial \\psi}{\\partial y} = 0\n$$\nThis boundary condition can be expressed in polar coordinates $(r, \\theta)$ as $r\\frac{\\partial \\psi}{\\partial r} = 0$ on the boundary $r=a$. Since $r=a \\neq 0$, the condition simplifies to $\\frac{\\partial \\psi}{\\partial r} = 0$ at $r=a$.\n\nThe governing boundary-value problem for $\\psi$ is thus:\nPDE: $\\nabla^2 \\psi = 0$ for $r  a$.\nBC: $\\frac{\\partial \\psi}{\\partial r} = 0$ at $r=a$.\n\nTo deduce whether $\\psi$ vanishes, we use Green's first identity over the domain $\\mathcal{D}$:\n$$\n\\iint_{\\mathcal{D}} (\\psi \\nabla^2 \\psi + |\\nabla \\psi|^2) \\,dA = \\oint_{\\partial\\mathcal{D}} \\psi \\frac{\\partial \\psi}{\\partial n} \\,ds\n$$\nHere, $\\frac{\\partial \\psi}{\\partial n}$ is the normal derivative, which is $\\frac{\\partial \\psi}{\\partial r}$. Since $\\nabla^2 \\psi = 0$ in $\\mathcal{D}$ and $\\frac{\\partial \\psi}{\\partial r} = 0$ on $\\partial\\mathcal{D}$, the identity reduces to:\n$$\n\\iint_{\\mathcal{D}} |\\nabla \\psi|^2 \\,dA = 0\n$$\nThe integrand $|\\nabla \\psi|^2 = (\\frac{\\partial \\psi}{\\partial x})^2 + (\\frac{\\partial \\psi}{\\partial y})^2$ is non-negative. For its integral over the domain to be zero, the integrand must be identically zero throughout the domain. Therefore, $\\nabla \\psi = 0$ for all $(x,y)$ in the cross-section. This implies that $\\psi(x,y)$ must be a constant. A constant warping represents a rigid-body translation along the $z$-axis, which induces no stress and can be set to zero without loss of generality, as specified in the problem statement. Thus, for a circular cross-section:\n$$\n\\psi(x,y) = 0\n$$\nThis signifies that circular cross-sections do not warp under torsion.\n\nWith $\\psi=0$, the stress components simplify to:\n$$\n\\sigma_{xz} = -G \\alpha y \\\\\n\\sigma_{yz} = G \\alpha x\n$$\nThe resultant torque $T$ on the cross-section is the integral of the moments produced by these shear stresses:\n$$\nT = \\iint_{\\mathcal{D}} (x \\sigma_{yz} - y \\sigma_{xz}) \\,dA = \\iint_{\\mathcal{D}} (x(G \\alpha x) - y(-G \\alpha y)) \\,dA = G \\alpha \\iint_{\\mathcal{D}} (x^2 + y^2) \\,dA\n$$\nThe integral is the polar moment of inertia $J$ of the circular cross-section. In polar coordinates:\n$$\nJ = \\int_0^{2\\pi} \\int_0^a r^2 \\cdot r \\,dr \\,d\\theta = 2\\pi \\left[\\frac{r^4}{4}\\right]_0^a = \\frac{\\pi a^4}{2}\n$$\nThus, $T = G \\alpha J$, which relates the twist per unit length $\\alpha$ to the applied torque $T$:\n$$\n\\alpha = \\frac{T}{GJ} = \\frac{2T}{G\\pi a^4}\n$$\nTo find the shear stress distribution, we express the stresses in cylindrical coordinates.

We may proceed to the solution.\n\n**Derivation from First Principles**\n\nThe Saint-Venant theory of torsion for a prismatic bar is based on a semi-inverse method. We start with a kinematic assumption for the displacement field and then use the fundamental equations of elasticity to determine the unknown functions.\n\n1.  **Kinematic Assumption**: The displacement vector $\\boldsymbol{u} = (u_x, u_y, u_z)$ is assumed to have the form corresponding to a rigid rotation of each cross-section about the $z$-axis, superimposed with an axial displacement or \"warping\", $\\psi(x, y)$, which is uniform along the length of the bar. Let $\\alpha$ be the constant rate of twist (angle of twist per unit length). The displacement components are:\n    $$u_x = -\\alpha z y$$\n    $$u_y = \\alpha z x$$\n    $$u_z = \\psi(x, y)$$\n    This assumption inherently allows for warping and does not presume that plane sections remain plane.\n\n2.  **Strain Field**: Using the small strain definitions, $\\epsilon_{ij} = \\frac{1}{2}(\\frac{\\partial u_i}{\\partial x_j} + \\frac{\\partial u_j}{\\partial x_i})$, we find the components of the strain tensor:\n    $$\\epsilon_{xx} = \\epsilon_{yy} = \\epsilon_{zz} = \\epsilon_{xy} = 0$$\n    The only non-zero strains are the shear components:\n    $$\\epsilon_{xz} = \\frac{1}{2} \\left( \\frac{\\partial u_x}{\\partial z} + \\frac{\\partial u_z}{\\partial x} \\right) = \\frac{1}{2} \\left( -\\alpha y + \\frac{\\partial \\psi}{\\partial x} \\right)$$\n    $$\\epsilon_{yz} = \\frac{1}{2} \\left( \\frac{\\partial u_y}{\\partial z} + \\frac{\\partial u_z}{\\partial y} \\right) = \\frac{1}{2} \\left( \\alpha x + \\frac{\\partial \\psi}{\\partial y} \\right)$$\n\n3.  **Constitutive Law**: For a homogeneous, linear elastic, and isotropic material, Hooke's Law is $\\sigma_{ij} = 2G \\epsilon_{ij} + \\lambda \\delta_{ij} \\epsilon_{kk}$. Since the trace of the strain tensor $\\epsilon_{kk} = \\epsilon_{xx} + \\epsilon_{yy} + \\epsilon_{zz} = 0$, all normal stresses are zero: $\\sigma_{xx} = \\sigma_{yy} = \\sigma_{zz} = 0$. The stress $\\sigma_{xy}$ is also zero. The only non-vanishing stress components are:\n    $$\\sigma_{xz} = 2G \\epsilon_{xz} = G \\left( \\frac{\\partial \\psi}{\\partial x} - \\alpha y \\right)$$\n    $$\\sigma_{yz} = 2G \\epsilon_{yz} = G \\left( \\frac{\\partial \\psi}{\\partial y} + \\alpha x \\right)$$\n    where $G$ is the shear modulus.\n\n4.  **Equilibrium**: In the absence of body forces, the equilibrium equations are $\\nabla \\cdot \\boldsymbol{\\sigma} = \\boldsymbol{0}$. The equations in the $x$ and $y$ directions are identically satisfied. The equation in the $z$ direction is:\n    $$\\frac{\\partial \\sigma_{zx}}{\\partial x} + \\frac{\\partial \\sigma_{zy}}{\\partial y} + \\frac{\\partial \\sigma_{zz}}{\\partial z} = 0$$\n    Substituting the expressions for the stresses:\n    $$\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} \\left[ G \\left( \\frac{\\partial \\psi}{\\partial x} - \\alpha y \\right) \\right] + \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y} \\left[ G \\left( \\frac{\\partial \\psi}{\\partial y} + \\alpha x \\right) \\right] = 0$$\n    $$G \\left( \\frac{\\partial^2 \\psi}{\\partial x^2} - 0 \\right) + G \\left( \\frac{\\partial^2 \\psi}{\\partial y^2} + 0 \\right) = 0$$\n    This simplifies to Laplace's equation for the warping function over the cross-sectional domain $\\Omega$:\n    $$\\nabla^2 \\psi = \\frac{\\partial^2 \\psi}{\\partial x^2} + \\frac{\\partial^2 \\psi}{\\partial y^2} = 0$$\n    Thus, $\\psi(x, y)$ must be a harmonic function.\n\n5.  **Boundary Condition**: The lateral surface of the bar is traction-free. The traction vector on the boundary $\\partial \\Omega$ of the cross-section is given by $\\boldsymbol{t} = \\boldsymbol{\\sigma} \\cdot \\boldsymbol{n}$, where $\\boldsymbol{n} = (n_x, n_y, 0)$ is the outward unit normal vector. The component of traction normal to the cross-section must be zero:\n    $$t_z = \\sigma_{zx} n_x + \\sigma_{zy} n_y = 0$$\n    Substituting the stress expressions:\n    $$G \\left( \\frac{\\partial \\psi}{\\partial x} - \\alpha y \\right) n_x + G \\left( \\frac{\\partial \\psi}{\\partial y} + \\alpha x \\right) n_y = 0$$\n    Rearranging gives the Neumann boundary condition for $\\psi$:\n    $$\\left( \\frac{\\partial \\psi}{\\partial x} n_x + \\frac{\\partial \\psi}{\\partial y} n_y \\right) = \\alpha (y n_x - x n_y)$$\n    This can be written compactly as:\n    $$\\frac{\\partial \\psi}{\\partial n} = \\nabla\\psi \\cdot \\boldsymbol{n} = \\alpha (y n_x - x n_y) \\quad \\text{on } \\partial\\Omega$$\n\n6.  **Analysis for Circular vs. Non-Circular Cross-Sections**:\n    -   **Circular Cross-Section**: For a circle of radius $R$ centered at the origin, the boundary is $x^2 + y^2 = R^2$. The outward unit normal is $\\boldsymbol{n} = (x/R, y/R)$. Substituting $n_x = x/R$ and $n_y = y/R$ into the boundary condition term:\n        $$y n_x - x n_y = y \\left( \\frac{x}{R} \\right) - x \\left( \\frac{y}{R} \\right) = \\frac{xy - xy}{R} = 0$$\n        The boundary condition thus reduces to a homogeneous Neumann condition:\n        $$\\frac{\\partial \\psi}{\\partial n} = 0 \\quad \\text{on } \\partial\\Omega$$\n        For Laplace's equation $\\nabla^2 \\psi = 0$ in a simply-connected domain, a homogeneous Neumann condition implies that the solution must be a constant, $\\psi(x,y) = C$. A constant axial displacement is a rigid body translation and does not contribute to stress or relative deformation. It can be set to zero without loss of generality. Thus, for a circular cross-section, there is no warping.\n    -   **Non-Circular Cross-Section**: For a general shape, the term $y n_x - x n_y$ is not identically zero on the boundary. For example, for a square with a side on the line $x=a$, we have $n_x=1$ and $n_y=0$, so $y n_x - x n_y = y$. The boundary condition is inhomogeneous, forcing a non-constant solution for $\\psi(x,y)$ and thus non-zero warping.\n\n**Option-by-Option Analysis**\n\n**A.** Kinematic: small strains; prismatic, simply connected cross-section; cross-sections undergo rigid-body rotation about the $z$-axis with a spatially uniform twist rate and an additional axial displacement (warping) that is an a priori unknown function over the cross-section; no restriction that plane sections remain plane. Constitutive: homogeneous, linear elastic, isotropic; only shear stresses compatible with torsion are present; lateral surface is traction-free; ends carry a resultant torque $T$ with no other resultants. Explanation: Equilibrium with no body forces and compatibility, combined with linear isotropic shear response, yield a harmonic warping field whose boundary condition involves the outward unit normal $\\boldsymbol{n}=(n_x,n_y)$ on the cross-sectional boundary. The boundary condition reduces to $(\\nabla \\psi)\\cdot \\boldsymbol{n} = \\alpha(y\\,n_x - x\\,n_y)$, where $\\psi(x,y)$ is the warping function and $\\alpha$ is the twist rate.

For noncircular boundaries, $y\\,n_x - x\\,n_y \\neq 0$ in general, producing a nontrivial harmonic solution and thus nonzero warping.\n\n-   This option correctly lists the kinematic and constitutive assumptions of Saint-Venant torsion. The explanation correctly identifies that the warping function $\\psi$ is harmonic and provides the correct form of the boundary condition. It then correctly explains that this boundary condition becomes homogeneous for a circular section, leading to zero warping, but is inhomogeneous for non-circular sections, leading to nonzero warping. This matches the first-principles derivation perfectly.\n-   **Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B.** Kinematic: small strains; prismatic; plane cross-sections remain plane and perpendicular to the axis for any cross-section shape; no warping is permitted. Constitutive: homogeneous, linear elastic, isotropic. Explanation: Since warping is kinematically forbidden, warping is $0$ for any cross-section, circular or not.\n\n-   This option makes a fundamentally incorrect kinematic assumption. Postulating that plane sections remain plane ($\\psi = \\text{constant}$) is an over-simplification that, for a general non-circular cross-section, violates the traction-free boundary condition on the lateral surface. It is inconsistent with the equations of elasticity. The elementary theory that makes this assumption is known to be inaccurate for non-circular shafts.\n-   **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C.** Kinematic: small strains; prismatic; cross-sections may warp. Constitutive: homogeneous, linear elastic, orthotropic with distinct shear moduli in planes $xz$ and $yz$. Explanation: Geometric circular symmetry alone is sufficient to force $0$ warping for a circular cross-section, regardless of material anisotropy, whereas noncircular cross-sections warp.\n\n-   The explanation is false. If the material is orthotropic with shear moduli $G_{xz}$ and $G_{yz}$, the equilibrium equation becomes $G_{xz} \\frac{\\partial^2 \\psi}{\\partial x^2} + G_{yz} \\frac{\\partial^2 \\psi}{\\partial y^2} = 0$. The boundary condition on a circular section becomes $\\frac{1}{R}(G_{xz} x \\frac{\\partial \\psi}{\\partial x} + G_{yz} y \\frac{\\partial \\psi}{\\partial y}) = \\frac{\\alpha xy}{R}(G_{xz} - G_{yz})$. If $G_{xz} \\neq G_{yz}$, the right-hand side is non-zero, creating an inhomogeneous boundary condition that leads to non-zero warping. Therefore, geometric symmetry is not sufficient; material isotropy (or a special type of anisotropy) is also required for warping to vanish.\n-   **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D.** Kinematic: small strains; prismatic; cross-sections may warp; twist rate need not be uniform along $z$. Constitutive: homogeneous, linear elastic, isotropic. Boundary condition is relaxed to allow nonzero shear traction on the lateral surface provided its resultant over the surface is $0$. Explanation: Warping vanishes for circles because the applied torque is uniform about the axis; for noncircular shapes, warping arises from nonuniform torque transmission.\n\n-   This option incorrectly describes the classical Saint-Venant problem. Assuming a non-uniform twist rate ($\\alpha = \\alpha(z)$) or relaxing the traction-free boundary condition changes the problem fundamentally. The classical setup requires $\\alpha$ to be constant and the lateral surface to be strictly traction-free. The explanation provided is vague and not based on the rigorous mathematical derivation stemming from equilibrium and boundary conditions.\n-   **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\nBased on the analysis, only option A provides a correct and complete account of the Saint-Venant torsion theory and the specific behavior of warping in circular and non-circular cross-sections.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2926965"}, {"introduction": "The practical utility of the Saint-Venant method hinges on Saint-Venant's Principle, which states that the effects of a localized, self-equilibrated load diminish rapidly with distance.

Conclude that the slowest decay is governed by the smallest positive eigenvalue $\\lambda_1$ of that problem, via $k_1 = \\sqrt{\\lambda_1}$, excluding rigid modes. Explain why the base torsion solution does not alter these decay rates for the superposed perturbation under the given assumptions.\n\nDesign a computational experiment in which the observable is the amplitude of the perturbation measured on a cross-section at distance $z$ from $z = 0$. Define the observable amplitude $A(z)$ as the $L^2$ norm over $\\Omega$ of the perturbation’s shear traction field on the cross-section at position $z$, normalized by its value at $z = 0$. Under the mode decomposition, argue that for sufficiently large $z$ the amplitude satisfies\n$$\nA(z) \\sim \\mathrm{e}^{-k_1 z},\n$$\nand the corresponding elastic energy density integrated over $\\Omega$ scales like\n$$\n\\mathcal{E}(z) \\sim \\mathrm{e}^{-2 k_1 z}.\n$$\nHence, two direct observables to quantify decay rates are $A(z)$ and $\\mathcal{E}(z)$, and the slope of $\\ln A(z)$ versus $z$ gives $-k_1$.\n\nFor implementation and testability, restrict $\\Omega$ to a rectangle of side lengths $a$ and $b$ (in $\\mathrm{m}$), aligned with the $x$ and $y$ axes, and compute $k_1$ by obtaining the smallest positive eigenvalue of the Neumann Laplacian on that rectangle (you may use analytical separation of variables or a numerical method of your choice). Then, for a given distance $z$ (in $\\mathrm{m}$), predict the observables\n$$\nA(z) = \\mathrm{e}^{-k_1 z}, \\quad \\mathcal{E}(z) = \\mathrm{e}^{-2 k_1 z}.\n$$\nAll distances must be handled in $\\mathrm{m}$, and the outputs $A(z)$ and $\\mathcal{E}(z)$ are dimensionless.\n\nImplement a program that, for each test case $(a,b,z)$, computes and returns the pair $[A(z), \\mathcal{E}(z)]$.\n\nTest Suite:\n- Case 1 (happy path, moderate size): $(a,b,z) = (\\,0.2\\,\\mathrm{m},\\,0.2\\,\\mathrm{m},\\,0.5\\,\\mathrm{m}\\,)$.\n- Case 2 (anisotropy in cross-section): $(a,b,z) = (\\,0.4\\,\\mathrm{m},\\,0.2\\,\\mathrm{m},\\,0.5\\,\\mathrm{m}\\,)$.\n- Case 3 (slender in $b$ but long reach into the bar): $(a,b,z) = (\\,1.0\\,\\mathrm{m},\\,0.1\\,\\mathrm{m},\\,1.0\\,\\mathrm{m}\\,)$.\n- Case 4 (large cross-section, short distance): $(a,b,z) = (\\,2.0\\,\\mathrm{m},\\,2.0\\,\\mathrm{m},\\,0.1\\,\\mathrm{m}\\,)$.\n\nYour program should produce a single line of output containing the results as a comma-separated list enclosed in square brackets. Each test case’s result must be a two-element sublist in the order $[A(z),\\mathcal{E}(z)]$. There must be no spaces anywhere in the line. For example, the output format must look like\n$$\n[\\,[A_1,\\mathcal{E}_1],[A_2,\\mathcal{E}_2],[A_3,\\mathcal{E}_3],[A_4,\\mathcal{E}_4]\\,].\n$$", "solution": "The problem presented is a standard exercise in the application of Saint-Venant's principle to a prismatic bar within the framework of linear elasticity. The validity of the problem statement is confirmed, as it is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. We shall proceed with the derivation and subsequent computation.\n\nThe mechanics of the bar are governed by the three-dimensional equations of linear elasticity. With no body forces, the equilibrium equation for the stress tensor $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}$ is $\\nabla \\cdot \\boldsymbol{\\sigma} = \\mathbf{0}$. The material is homogeneous and isotropic, so Hooke's law relates stress to the strain tensor $\\boldsymbol{\\epsilon}$ by $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma} = \\lambda_L \\mathrm{tr}(\\boldsymbol{\\epsilon})\\mathbf{I} + 2\\mu\\boldsymbol{\\epsilon}$, where $\\lambda_L$ and $\\mu$ are the Lamé parameters. The strain is derived from the displacement field $\\mathbf{u}$ via the linear kinematic relation $\\boldsymbol{\\epsilon} = \\frac{1}{2}(\\nabla \\mathbf{u} + (\\nabla \\mathbf{u})^T)$.\n\nThe problem concerns a self-equilibrated perturbation superposed on a pure torsion state. Due to the linearity of the governing equations, the principle of superposition applies. The base torsion solution and the perturbation solution can be analyzed independently. The perturbation displacement field $\\mathbf{u}_p$ must satisfy the governing equations with zero traction on the lateral surfaces of the bar and a self-equilibrated traction distribution on the end face at $z=0$. Saint-Venant's principle posits that such localized, self-equilibrated loads produce effects that decay with distance from the point of application.\n\nTo formalize this, we seek solutions for the perturbation field of the form $\\mathbf{u}(\\mathbf{x}) = \\mathbf{v}(x,y) e^{-kz}$, which represents a mode of deformation that decays exponentially along the bar's axis, the $z$-axis. Substituting this ansatz into the Navier equations of elasticity, $\\mu \\nabla^2 \\mathbf{u} + (\\lambda_L + \\mu) \\nabla(\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{u}) = \\mathbf{0}$, results in a two-dimensional generalized eigenvalue problem for the decay rate squared, $k^2$, on the cross-section $\\Omega$.\n\nA complete derivation using displacement potentials (for instance, the Papkovich-Neuber representation) demonstrates that the problem of finding the admissible decay rates $k$ can be reduced, under appropriate conditions, to solving for the eigenvalues of the two-dimensional scalar Laplacian operator on the cross-section $\\Omega$. The boundary condition of zero traction on the lateral surface, $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}\\mathbf{n} = \\mathbf{0}$ where $\\mathbf{n}$ is the normal to the boundary $\\partial\\Omega$ in the $x$-$y$ plane, translates to homogeneous Neumann boundary conditions for the underlying potential functions. Thus, we must solve the eigenproblem:\n$$\n-\\nabla^2 \\psi = \\lambda \\psi \\quad \\text{in } \\Omega\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial \\psi}{\\partial n} = 0 \\quad \\text{on } \\partial\\Omega\n$$\nwhere $\\nabla^2 = \\partial^2/\\partial x^2 + \\partial^2/\\partial y^2$. This problem yields a spectrum of non-negative eigenvalues $0 = \\lambda_0  \\lambda_1 \\leq \\lambda_2 \\leq \\dots$. The decay rates are related to these eigenvalues by $k_n = \\sqrt{\\lambda_n}$.\n\nThe eigenvalue $\\lambda_0=0$, corresponding to a constant eigenfunction, gives $k_0=0$. This zero decay rate corresponds to rigid-body modes. The condition that the end load perturbation is self-equilibrated (zero resultant force and moment) is an orthogonality condition. It ensures that the expansion of the end load into the system's eigenmodes does not contain components corresponding to the non-decaying rigid-body motions. Therefore, the perturbation solution is a superposition of modes with positive decay rates $k_n = \\sqrt{\\lambda_n}$ for $n \\ge 1$. For sufficiently large distances $z$ from the end face, the mode with the smallest positive decay rate will dominate the behavior of the solution. This slowest decay rate is $k_1 = \\sqrt{\\lambda_1}$, where $\\lambda_1$ is the smallest positive eigenvalue of the Neumann-Laplacian on $\\Omega$.\n\nThe observables $A(z)$ and $\\mathcal{E}(z)$ are defined based on the perturbation field. $A(z)$ is the normalized $L^2$ norm of the shear tractions $(\\sigma_{xz}, \\sigma_{yz})$ on the cross-section at $z$. For large $z$, the stress components are dominated by the first mode, so $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}_{\\text{pert}} \\sim e^{-k_1 z}$. The $L^2$ norm involves an integral of $\\sigma_{xz}^2 + \\sigma_{yz}^2 \\sim e^{-2k_1 z}$. Taking the square root, after normalization, yields $A(z) \\sim e^{-k_1 z}$. The elastic energy density $W = \\frac{1}{2}\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}:\\boldsymbol{\\epsilon}$ involves products of stress and strain components, both of which decay as $e^{-k_1 z}$. Thus, $W \\sim e^{-2k_1 z}$, and its integral over the cross-section, $\\mathcal{E}(z)$, also follows this scaling. The problem statement defines $A(z)$ and $\\mathcal{E}(z)$ as the limiting forms $A(z) = e^{-k_1 z}$ and $\\mathcal{E}(z) = e^{-2k_1 z}$, which we will use for computation.\n\nFor the specified rectangular cross-section $\\Omega = [0, a] \\times [0, b]$, the eigenvalue problem is solved by separation of variables. Let $\\psi(x,y) = X(x)Y(y)$. The boundary value problem separates into two one-dimensional Sturm-Liouville problems:\n$X''(x) + \\lambda_x X(x) = 0$ with $X'(0) = X'(a) = 0$.\n$Y''(y) + \\lambda_y Y(y) = 0$ with $Y'(0) = Y'(b) = 0$.\nThe solutions yield eigenvalues $\\lambda_{x,m} = (\\frac{m\\pi}{a})^2$ for $m=0, 1, 2, \\dots$ and $\\lambda_{y,n} = (\\frac{n\\pi}{b})^2$ for $n=0, 1, 2, \\dots$. The eigenvalues for the two-dimensional problem are the sums $\\lambda_{m,n} = \\lambda_{x,m} + \\lambda_{y,n} = (\\frac{m\\pi}{a})^2 + (\\frac{n\\pi}{b})^2$.\n\nThe smallest eigenvalue is $\\lambda_{0,0} = 0$, which is excluded. The smallest positive (non-zero) eigenvalue, $\\lambda_1$, is found by choosing $(m,n)$ to be either $(1,0)$ or $(0,1)$:\n$$\n\\lambda_1 = \\min(\\lambda_{1,0}, \\lambda_{0,1}) = \\min\\left(\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{a}\\right)^2, \\left(\\frac{\\pi}{b}\\right)^2\\right) = \\pi^2 \\min\\left(\\frac{1}{a^2}, \\frac{1}{b^2}\\right) = \\frac{\\pi^2}{(\\max(a,b))^2}\n$$\nThe slowest decay rate is therefore:\n$$\nk_1 = \\sqrt{\\lambda_1} = \\frac{\\pi}{\\max(a,b)}\n$$\nThis result is physically intuitive: the characteristic length for decay is governed by the largest dimension of the cross-section.\n\nWith this, we can compute the observables for the given test cases. For each triplet $(a,b,z)$, we first find $k_1 = \\pi/\\max(a,b)$ and then compute $A(z) = e^{-k_1 z}$ and $\\mathcal{E}(z) = e^{-2k_1 z}$.", "answer": "```python\n# The complete and runnable Python 3 code goes here.\n# Imports must adhere to the specified execution environment.\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Computes the decay observables for self-equilibrated end perturbations\n    on a prismatic bar with a rectangular cross-section.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define the test cases from the problem statement.\n    # Each case is a tuple (a, b, z) where a and b are the side lengths\n    # of the rectangular cross-section in meters, and z is the distance\n    # along the bar in meters.\n    test_cases = [\n        (0.2, 0.2, 0.5),  # Case 1\n        (0.4, 0.2, 0.5),  # Case 2\n        (1.0, 0.1, 1.0),  # Case 3\n        (2.0, 2.0, 0.1),  # Case 4\n    ]\n\n    results = []\n    for case in test_cases:\n        a, b, z = case\n\n        # The slowest decay rate k1 is determined by the largest dimension of the\n        # cross-section, according to the solution of the Neumann-Laplacian\n        # eigenvalue problem on a rectangle.\n        # k1 = sqrt(lambda1) where lambda1 = pi^2 / (max(a,b))^2.\n        # So, k1 = pi / max(a,b).\n        d_max = max(a, b)\n        k1 = np.pi / d_max\n\n        # The amplitude of the perturbation A(z) is assumed to decay as exp(-k1*z).\n        # This is the asymptotic behavior for large z, dominated by the slowest mode.\n        A_z = np.exp(-k1 * z)\n\n        # The integrated elastic energy density E(z) decays as exp(-2*k1*z) because\n        # energy density is quadratic in stress/strain fields, which themselves\n        # decay as exp(-k1*z).\n        E_z = np.exp(-2 * k1 * z)\n\n        results.append([A_z, E_z])\n\n    # Final print statement in the exact required format.\n    # The format is a single line: [[A_1,E_1],[A_2,E_2],[A_3,E_3],[A_4,E_4]]\n    # with no spaces.\n    output_str = f\"[[{results[0][0]},{results[0][1]}],[{results[1][0]},{results[1][1]}],[{results[2][0]},{results[2][1]}],[{results[3][0]},{results[3][1]}]\"\n    print(output_str)\n\nsolve()\n```", "id": "2683210"}]}
