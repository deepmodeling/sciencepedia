The problem is well-posed, scientifically grounded, and contains all necessary information for its solution. We will proceed methodically through the specified tasks.\n\nFirst, we derive the strong form of the boundary value problem (BVP) for the normalized Prandtl stress function $\\psi$. The analysis begins with the fundamental equations of linear elasticity. In Saint-Venant torsion, the only non-zero stress components are the shear stresses $\\tau_{xz}$ and $\\tau_{yz}$. The equilibrium equation in the absence of body forces, $\\nabla \\cdot \\boldsymbol{\\sigma} = \\mathbf{0}$, reduces to a single non-trivial equation in the longitudinal direction:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial \\tau_{xz}}{\\partial x} + \\frac{\\partial \\tau_{yz}}{\\partial y} = 0\n$$\nThis equation implies that the two-dimensional vector field $(\\tau_{xz}, \\tau_{yz})$ is divergence-free. This condition is a necessary prerequisite for the introduction of a scalar potential, which is the Prandtl stress function $\\phi(x,y)$. The stresses are defined in terms of $\\phi$ as:\n$$\n\\tau_{xz} = \\frac{\\partial \\phi}{\\partial y}, \\qquad \\tau_{yz} = -\\frac{\\partial \\phi}{\\partial x}\n$$\nWith these definitions, the equilibrium equation is satisfied identically, provided $\\phi$ is of class $C^2$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}\\left(\\frac{\\partial \\phi}{\\partial y}\\right) + \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}\\left(-\\frac{\\partial \\phi}{\\partial x}\\right) = \\frac{\\partial^2 \\phi}{\\partial x \\partial y} - \\frac{\\partial^2 \\phi}{\\partial y \\partial x} = 0\n$$\nThe governing partial differential equation for $\\phi$ arises not from equilibrium, but from the strain compatibility conditions. The kinematics of Saint-Venant torsion specify the displacement field as $u_x = -k z y$, $u_y = k z x$, and $u_z = w(x,y)$, where $w(x,y)$ is the warping function. The corresponding non-zero engineering shear strains are $\\gamma_{xz} = -k y + \\frac{\\partial w}{\\partial x}$ and $\\gamma_{yz} = k x + \\frac{\\partial w}{\\partial y}$.\nFor a homogeneous, isotropic, linearly elastic material, the stress-strain relations are $\\tau_{xz} = G \\gamma_{xz}$ and $\\tau_{yz} = G \\gamma_{yz}$. Substituting the definitions of $\\phi$ gives:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{G}\\frac{\\partial \\phi}{\\partial y} = -k y + \\frac{\\partial w}{\\partial x} \\implies \\frac{\\partial w}{\\partial x} = \\frac{1}{G}\\frac{\\partial \\phi}{\\partial y} + k y\n$$\n$$\n-\\frac{1}{G}\\frac{\\partial \\phi}{\\partial x} = k x + \\frac{\\partial w}{\\partial y} \\implies \\frac{\\partial w}{\\partial y} = -\\frac{1}{G}\\frac{\\partial \\phi}{\\partial x} - k x\n$$\nFor the warping function $w(x,y)$ to exist, the mixed second partial derivatives must be equal: $\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}(\\frac{\\partial w}{\\partial x}) = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}(\\frac{\\partial w}{\\partial y})$. Applying this condition:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}\\left(\\frac{1}{G}\\frac{\\partial \\phi}{\\partial y} + k y\\right) = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}\\left(-\\frac{1}{G}\\frac{\\partial \\phi}{\\partial x} - k x\\right)\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{1}{G}\\frac{\\partial^2 \\phi}{\\partial y^2} + k = -\\frac{1}{G}\\frac{\\partial^2 \\phi}{\\partial x^2} - k\n$$\nThis simplifies to the Poisson equation for the Prandtl stress function:\n$$\n\\nabla^2 \\phi = \\frac{\\partial^2 \\phi}{\\partial x^2} + \\frac{\\partial^2 \\phi}{\\partial y^2} = -2 G k\n$$\nThe boundary condition comes from the requirement that the lateral surface of the bar is traction-free. The traction vector on a surface with outward normal $\\mathbf{n} = (n_x, n_y, 0)$ has a $z$-component $t_z = \\tau_{xz} n_x + \\tau_{yz} n_y$. Setting $t_z = 0$ on the boundary $\\partial A$ of the cross-section yields:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial \\phi}{\\partial y} n_x - \\frac{\\partial \\phi}{\\partial x} n_y = 0 \\quad \\text{on } \\partial A\n$$\nThis expression is the dot product of $\\nabla \\phi$ with the tangent vector to the boundary, which means that the directional derivative of $\\phi$ along the boundary is zero. Thus, $\\phi$ must be constant on $\\partial A$. For a simply connected domain $A$, this constant can be set to zero without loss of generality. So, $\\phi = 0$ on $\\partial A$.\nNow, we introduce the normalized function $\\psi = \\phi / (Gk)$. The BVP for $\\psi$ is obtained by substitution:\n$$\n\\nabla^2 (Gk \\psi) = -2 Gk \\implies \\nabla^2 \\psi = -2 \\quad \\text{in } A\n$$\n$$\nGk \\psi = 0 \\implies \\psi = 0 \\quad \\text{on } \\partial A\n$$\nThis is the strong form of the BVP. To derive the weak form, we multiply the PDE by an arbitrary test function $\\eta \\in H_0^1(A)$ and integrate over the domain $A$. The space $H_0^1(A)$ is the correct choice, as functions in this space and their weak first derivatives are square-integrable, and they vanish on the boundary $\\partial A$.\n$$\n\\int_A (-\\nabla^2 \\psi) \\eta \\, dA = \\int_A 2 \\eta \\, dA\n$$\nUsing Green's first identity (integration by parts) on the left-hand side:\n$$\n\\int_A \\nabla \\psi \\cdot \\nabla \\eta \\, dA - \\oint_{\\partial A} \\eta (\\nabla \\psi \\cdot \\mathbf{n}) \\, ds = \\int_A 2 \\eta \\, dA\n$$\nSince $\\eta \\in H_0^1(A)$, it is zero on the boundary $\\partial A$. The boundary integral therefore vanishes. The weak form is: find $\\psi \\in H_0^1(A)$ such that for all test functions $\\eta \\in H_0^1(A)$:\n$$\n\\int_A \\nabla \\psi \\cdot \\nabla \\eta \\, dA = \\int_A 2 \\eta \\, dA\n$$\nThis has the structure $a(\\psi, \\eta) = l(\\eta)$, with a bilinear form $a(\\psi, \\eta) = \\int_A \\nabla \\psi \\cdot \\nabla \\eta \\, dA$ and a linear functional $l(\\eta) = \\int_A 2 \\eta \\, dA$.\n\nSecond, we express the torsional rigidity $J$ in terms of $\\psi$. The applied torque $T$ is the resultant of the shear stresses over the cross-section:\n$$\nT = \\int_A (x \\tau_{yz} - y \\tau_{xz}) \\, dA\n$$\nSubstituting the definitions in terms of $\\phi$:\n$$\nT = \\int_A \\left(x \\left(-\\frac{\\partial \\phi}{\\partial x}\\right) - y \\left(\\frac{\\partial \\phi}{\\partial y}\\right)\\right) \\, dA = -\\int_A \\left(x \\frac{\\partial \\phi}{\\partial x} + y \\frac{\\partial \\phi}{\\partial y}\\right) \\, dA\n$$\nWe use the product rule for divergence: $\\nabla \\cdot (\\mathbf{F}\\phi) = \\phi(\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{F}) + \\mathbf{F} \\cdot \\nabla\\phi$. Let the vector field be $\\mathbf{F} = \\mathbf{r} = (x, y)$. Then $\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{r} = 2$. The integrand is $\\mathbf{r} \\cdot \\nabla\\phi$. Rearranging the product rule gives $\\mathbf{r} \\cdot \\nabla\\phi = \\nabla \\cdot (\\mathbf{r}\\phi) - 2\\phi$. Substituting this into the integral for $T$:\n$$\nT = -\\int_A (\\nabla \\cdot (\\mathbf{r}\\phi) - 2\\phi) \\, dA = 2\\int_A \\phi \\, dA - \\int_A \\nabla \\cdot (\\mathbf{r}\\phi) \\, dA\n$$\nBy the divergence theorem, the second integral is converted to a boundary integral:\n$$\n\\int_A \\nabla \\cdot (\\mathbf{r}\\phi) \\, dA = \\oint_{\\partial A} (\\mathbf{r}\\phi) \\cdot \\mathbf{n} \\, ds\n$$\nSince $\\phi = 0$ on the boundary $\\partial A$, this boundary contribution is identically zero. Therefore, the torque simplifies to:\n$$\nT = 2\\int_A \\phi \\, dA\n$$\nThe torsional rigidity $J$ is defined by $T = Gk J$. Substituting the expression for $T$ and the relation $\\phi = Gk \\psi$:\n$$\nGk J = 2\\int_A (Gk \\psi) \\, dA = 2 Gk \\int_A \\psi \\, dA\n$$\nThus, the torsional rigidity is given by the area integral:\n$$\nJ = 2\\int_A \\psi \\, dA\n$$\n\nThird, we specialize to the elliptical cross-section defined by $x^2/a^2 + y^2/b^2 \\le 1$. We must solve the BVP: $\\nabla^2 \\psi = -2$ in the ellipse, and $\\psi = 0$ on its boundary. We propose a solution of the form:\n$$\n\\psi(x, y) = C \\left(\\frac{x^2}{a^2} + \\frac{y^2}{b^2} - 1\\right)\n$$\nwhere $C$ is a constant. This form correctly satisfies the boundary condition $\\psi=0$ on $x^2/a^2 + y^2/b^2 = 1$. We determine $C$ by substituting this ansatz into the PDE. The partial derivatives are:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial^2 \\psi}{\\partial x^2} = C \\frac{2}{a^2}, \\qquad \\frac{\\partial^2 \\psi}{\\partial y^2} = C \\frac{2}{b^2}\n$$\nThe Laplacian is $\\nabla^2 \\psi = 2C(\\frac{1}{a^2} + \\frac{1}{b^2}) = 2C \\frac{a^2+b^2}{a^2b^2}$. Equating this to $-2$:\n$$\n2C \\frac{a^2+b^2}{a^2b^2} = -2 \\implies C = - \\frac{a^2b^2}{a^2+b^2}\n$$\nThe normalized stress function for the elliptical cross-section is:\n$$\n\\psi(x,y) = -\\frac{a^2b^2}{a^2+b^2} \\left(\\frac{x^2}{a^2} + \\frac{y^2}{b^2} - 1\\right)\n$$\nNow, we calculate the torsional rigidity $J = 2 \\int_A \\psi \\, dA$:\n$$\nJ = 2 \\int_A \\left(-\\frac{a^2b^2}{a^2+b^2}\\right) \\left(\\frac{x^2}{a^2} + \\frac{y^2}{b^2} - 1\\right) \\, dx dy\n$$\n$$\nJ = -\\frac{2a^2b^2}{a^2+b^2} \\int_A \\left(\\frac{x^2}{a^2} + \\frac{y^2}{b^2} - 1\\right) \\, dx dy\n$$\nTo evaluate the integral, we use the transformation to generalized polar coordinates: $x = a\\rho\\cos\\theta$, $y = b\\rho\\sin\\theta$. The Jacobian of this transformation is $ab\\rho$. The domain of integration becomes $\\rho \\in [0, 1]$, $\\theta \\in [0, 2\\pi]$. The integrand becomes $\\rho^2 - 1$.\n$$\nJ = -\\frac{2a^2b^2}{a^2+b^2} \\int_0^{2\\pi} \\int_0^1 (\\rho^2-1)(ab\\rho) \\, d\\rho d\\theta\n$$\n$$\nJ = -\\frac{2a^3b^3}{a^2+b^2} \\int_0^{2\\pi} \\left[ \\int_0^1 (\\rho^3-\\rho) \\, d\\rho \\right] d\\theta\n$$\nThe inner integral is:\n$$\n\\int_0^1 (\\rho^3-\\rho) \\, d\\rho = \\left[ \\frac{\\rho^4}{4} - \\frac{\\rho^2}{2} \\right]_0^1 = \\frac{1}{4} - \\frac{1}{2} = -\\frac{1}{4}\n$$\nSubstituting this back:\n$$\nJ = -\\frac{2a^3b^3}{a^2+b^2} \\int_0^{2\\pi} \\left(-\\frac{1}{4}\\right) d\\theta = \\frac{a^3b^3}{2(a^2+b^2)} \\int_0^{2\\pi} d\\theta = \\frac{a^3b^3}{2(a^2+b^2)} (2\\pi)\n$$\nThe final result for the torsional rigidity of an elliptical cross-section is:\n$$\nJ = \\frac{\\pi a^3 b^3}{a^2 + b^2}\n$$\nThis expression is dimensionally consistent, with units of length to the fourth power, as required for a rigidity parameter.
