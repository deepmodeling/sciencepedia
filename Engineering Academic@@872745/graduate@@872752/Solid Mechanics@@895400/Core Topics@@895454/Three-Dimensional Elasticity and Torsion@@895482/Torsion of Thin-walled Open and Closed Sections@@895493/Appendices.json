It represents a standard exercise in the mechanics of materials concerning the torsion of thin-walled members. We will proceed with its systematic solution.\n\nThe objective is to derive the Saint-Venant torsional constants for a thin-walled tube in both its closed and open (slit) configurations and then to compute the ratio of these constants. The defining relationship for the Saint-Venant torsional constant $J$ is given by $T = G J \\theta'$, where $T$ is the applied torque, $G$ is the shear modulus, and $\\theta'$ is the rate of twist per unit length.\n\nFirst, we consider the closed tube, for which we use Bredt's theory for thin-walled closed sections. The torsional constant, which we shall denote $J_{\\text{before}}$, can be derived from the relationship between torque, shear flow, and the rate of twist. The general formula for the torsional constant of a thin-walled closed section is:\n$$ J = \\frac{4 A_m^2}{\\oint \\frac{ds}{t}} $$\nwhere $A_m$ is the area enclosed by the midline of the cross-section's wall, $t$ is the wall thickness, and the integral is taken along the midline contour $s$.\n\nFor the given circular tube with mean radius $R$ and uniform thickness $t$:\nThe area enclosed by the midline is $A_m = \\pi R^2$.\nThe thickness $t$ is constant.\nThe path of integration is the circumference of the midline, so $\\oint ds = 2 \\pi R$.\n\nSubstituting these into the formula for $J$:\n$$ J_{\\text{before}} = \\frac{4 (\\pi R^2)^2}{\\frac{2 \\pi R}{t}} = \\frac{4 \\pi^2 R^4 t}{2 \\pi R} $$\nSimplifying this expression yields the torsional constant for the closed tube:\n$$ J_{\\text{before}} = 2 \\pi R^3 t $$\n\nNext, we consider the open tube, created by cutting a longitudinal slit of width $\\delta$. The problem states that the total midline length of the resulting open curved strip is $2 \\pi R - \\delta$. This geometry constitutes an open thin-walled section. For such sections, the torsional stiffness is drastically reduced compared to their closed counterparts.\n\nThe torsional constant of an open thin-walled section is found by summing the torsional constants of its constituent rectangular parts. In this case, the entire section can be treated as a single, long, narrow rectangular strip that has been curved. Under the thin-wall assumption ($R \\gg t$), the effect of curvature on the Saint-Venant torsional constant is negligible. The problem can therefore be simplified by \"unrolling\" the curved strip into a flat rectangle.\n\nThe dimensions of this equivalent rectangular strip are:\nLength: $b = 2 \\pi R - \\delta$.\nThickness: $t$.\n\nThe Saint-Venant torsional constant for a narrow rectangular cross-section ($b \\gg t$) is given by the well-established formula:\n$$ J \\approx \\frac{1}{3} b t^3 $$\nThis is a standard result from the theory of elasticity and is highly accurate for the thin-walled case where $b/t$ is large. Given the problem's assumption that $R \\gg t$, it follows that $b \\approx 2 \\pi R \\gg t$, which justifies the use of this formula.\n\nSubstituting the dimensions of our strip, we find the torsional constant for the open section, $J_{\\text{after}}$:\n$$ J_{\\text{after}} = \\frac{1}{3} (2 \\pi R - \\delta) t^3 $$\n\nFinally, we compute the required ratio, $J_{\\text{after}} / J_{\\text{before}}$:\n$$ \\frac{J_{\\text{after}}}{J_{\\text{before}}} = \\frac{\\frac{1}{3} (2 \\pi R - \\delta) t^3}{2 \\pi R^3 t} $$\nWe proceed with algebraic simplification of this ratio:\n$$ \\frac{J_{\\text{after}}}{J_{\\text{before}}} = \\frac{(2 \\pi R - \\delta) t^3}{3 \\cdot (2 \\pi R^3 t)} = \\frac{(2 \\pi R - \\delta) t^2}{6 \\pi R^3} $$\nThis expression is the final simplified result. It correctly shows that the torsional stiffness of the open section is proportional to $t^3$, whereas the stiffness of the closed section is proportional to $t$, leading to a dramatic reduction in stiffness, as indicated by the ratio's dependence on $(t/R)^2$, which is a very small quantity.", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{\\frac{(2 \\pi R - \\delta) t^2}{6 \\pi R^3}} $$", "id": "2705347"}, {"introduction": "After observing the relative weakness of open sections, it becomes crucial to understand how their torsional stiffness is calculated.

It is a standard problem in the mechanics of thin-walled structures and its validation is affirmative. We proceed with the solution.\n\nThe problem is to be solved from first principles of local force equilibrium and the defining properties of Saint-Venant torsion for a single-cell, thin-walled, closed section.\n\nPart 1: Continuity of Shear Flow\n\nWe begin by considering the equilibrium of an infinitesimal element of the wall. Let $s$ be the coordinate along the median line of the wall's cross-section, and let $z$ be the coordinate along the longitudinal axis of the member, which is coaxial with the applied torque $T$. The wall has a thickness $t(s)$.\n\nConsider an element of the wall defined by the intervals $[s, s+ds]$ and $[z, z+dz]$. The forces acting on this element in the $z$-direction arise from the normal stress $\\sigma_z$ acting on the faces at $z$ and $z+dz$, and the shear stress $\\tau_{sz}$ acting on the faces at $s$ and $s+ds$. For equilibrium, the sum of all forces in the $z$-direction must be zero.\n\nThe force from normal stress on the face at $z$ is $\\sigma_z(z) t(s) ds$. The force on the face at $z+dz$ is $-\\sigma_z(z+dz) t(s) ds$.\nThe force from shear stress on the face at $s$ is $-\\tau_{sz}(s) t(s) dz$. The force on the face at $s+ds$ is $\\tau_{sz}(s+ds) t(s+ds) dz$.\n\nSumming these forces yields:\n$$(\\sigma_z(z) - \\sigma_z(z+dz)) t(s) ds + (\\tau_{sz}(s+ds) t(s+ds) - \\tau_{sz}(s) t(s)) dz = 0$$\nDividing by the volume of the element, $ds \\, dz$, and taking the limit as $ds \\to 0$ and $dz \\to 0$, we obtain the differential equation of equilibrium in the $z$-direction:\n$$-\\frac{\\partial \\sigma_z}{\\partial z} t(s) + \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial s}(\\tau_{sz} t) = 0$$\n\nThe shear flow, $q(s)$, is defined as the product of the average shear stress $\\tau(s)$ and the wall thickness $t(s)$, so $q(s) = \\tau(s) t(s)$. Note that for Saint-Venant torsion, the shear stress $\\tau_{sz}$ is independent of $z$. The equilibrium equation becomes:\n$$\\frac{dq}{ds} = t(s) \\frac{d\\sigma_z}{dz}$$\n\nA defining property of Saint-Venant torsion is that it induces no axial normal stress; that is, $\\sigma_z = 0$ everywhere. Consequently, the term $\\frac{d\\sigma_z}{dz}$ is zero. The equilibrium equation thus simplifies to:\n$$\\frac{dq}{ds} = 0$$\nThis equation states that the rate of change of shear flow along the perimeter is zero. Integrating this equation with respect to $s$ shows that the shear flow $q$ must be constant along any continuous segment of the wall.\n\nThe problem states there are \"no discrete point forces or couples applied at the corner\". The absence of any external axial force concentrated at the corner means that the equilibrium principle must hold across the junction. Therefore, the shear flow cannot change as we cross the corner. If we denote the shear flow immediately before the corner in panel $1$ as $q_1$ and immediately after the corner in panel $2$ as $q_2$, it must be that $q_1 = q_2$. This establishes that the shear flow $q$ cannot have a finite jump across the sharp corner. The shear flow $q$ is constant throughout the entire closed section.\n\nPart 2: Ratio of Shear Stresses\n\nHaving established the continuity of shear flow, $q_1 = q_2$, we now use the relationship between shear flow $q$, shear stress $\\tau$, and wall thickness $t$. As given, this relationship is $q(s) = \\tau(s) t(s)$.\n\nIn panel $1$, immediately adjacent to the corner, the wall thickness is $t_1$ and the shear stress is $\\tau_1$. The shear flow is:\n$$q_1 = \\tau_1 t_1$$\nIn panel $2$, also immediately adjacent to the corner, the wall thickness is $t_2$ and the shear stress is $\\tau_2$. The shear flow is:\n$$q_2 = \\tau_2 t_2$$\nFrom the equilibrium condition derived in Part 1, we equate the shear flows:\n$$q_1 = q_2$$\n$$\\tau_1 t_1 = \\tau_2 t_2$$\nThe problem requires the ratio $\\frac{\\tau_2}{\\tau_1}$. We rearrange the equation to solve for this ratio:\n$$\\frac{\\tau_2}{\\tau_1} = \\frac{t_1}{t_2}$$\nThis result indicates that the shear stress is inversely proportional to the wall thickness, which is a classic result in the analysis of thin-walled closed sections under torsion. The stress is higher in the thinner portion of the wall to maintain a constant flow of shear force.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{t_1}{t_2}}$$", "id": "2705289"}]}
