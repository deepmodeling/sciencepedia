It is scientifically grounded in the established theory of linear elasticity, is well-posed with sufficient information for a unique solution, and is expressed in objective, formal language. There are no contradictions, ambiguities, or factual unsoundness. The problem requires a standard, albeit detailed, derivation of a quantity of physical interest from a fundamental solution in solid mechanics. I will now proceed to the derivation.\n\nThe objective is to find the hydrostatic stress, defined as $\\frac{1}{3}\\sigma_{kk}$, for the displacement field generated by a point force $F_j$ at the origin of an unbounded isotropic elastic solid. This displacement field is the Kelvin solution.\n\nThe Kelvin solution for the displacement $u_i$ at a point with position vector $x_k$ due to a point force $F_j$ at the origin is given by:\n$$ u_i(x) = \\frac{1}{16\\pi\\mu(1-\\nu)} \\left( (3-4\\nu)\\frac{\\delta_{ij} F_j}{r} + \\frac{x_i x_j F_j}{r^3} \\right) $$\nHere, $\\mu$ is the shear modulus, $\\nu$ is Poisson's ratio, $r = (x_k x_k)^{1/2}$ is the distance from the origin, and $\\delta_{ij}$ is the Kronecker delta.

To find the stress, we first need the strain tensor, $\\epsilon_{ij}$, which is derived from the displacement field using the linearized strain-displacement relation:\n$$ \\epsilon_{ij} = \\frac{1}{2}(u_{i,j} + u_{j,i}) $$\nwhere the comma denotes partial differentiation (e.g., $u_{i,j} = \\frac{\\partial u_i}{\\partial x_j}$). The quantity of interest for hydrostatic stress is the volumetric strain or dilatation, $\\epsilon_{kk}$, which is the trace of the strain tensor.\n$$ \\epsilon_{kk} = \\epsilon_{11} + \\epsilon_{22} + \\epsilon_{33} = u_{k,k} = \\frac{\\partial u_k}{\\partial x_k} $$\nWe proceed by computing the divergence of the displacement field $u_k$.

Therefore:\n$$ \\frac{1}{3}\\sigma_{kk} = -\\frac{1}{3} \\frac{1+\\nu}{4\\pi(1-\\nu)} \\frac{F_j x_j}{r^3} = -\\frac{1+\\nu}{12\\pi(1-\\nu)} \\frac{F_j x_j}{r^3} $$\nThis expression reveals the dependencies requested. The dependence on Poisson's ratio $\\nu$ is captured by the term $\\frac{1+\\nu}{1-\\nu}$. For most materials, $0 \\le \\nu < 0.5$, so this factor is positive and increases with $\\nu$.\nThe dependence on the orientation between the force vector $\\vec{F}$ (with components $F_j$) and the position vector $\\vec{x}$ (with components $x_j$) is contained in the scalar product $F_j x_j = \\vec{F} \\cdot \\vec{x}$.

The hydrostatic stress is thus proportional to $\\frac{\\cos\\theta}{r^2}$. It is tensile (negative) in the direction of the force and compressive (positive) opposite to the force, and vanishes on the plane through the origin normal to the force vector.\n\nThe final expression is the derived formula for the hydrostatic stress.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{-\\frac{1+\\nu}{12\\pi(1-\\nu)} \\frac{F_j x_j}{r^3}}\n$$", "id": "2652620"}, {"introduction": "Real-world engineering problems often involve boundaries, such as the surface of the earth or a machine component.

The governing principle is to superpose the field of the primary singularity (the Kelvin solution for the applied force) with the fields of a system of image singularities placed in the non-physical domain ($z  0$). These image singularities are chosen such that their combined traction on the boundary ($z=0$) precisely cancels the traction produced by the primary source, thus satisfying the traction-free boundary condition.\n\nFor a point force $P$ acting in the positive $z$-direction at the origin on the surface of the half-space $z \\ge 0$, the correct solution is obtained by considering a force $P$ at a small depth $c$ (at position $(0,0,c)$) and then taking the limit as $c \\to 0$. The image system required to annul the tractions on the plane $z=0$ is complex, involving not just an image force, but also a force doublet and a center of dilatation at the image point $(0,0,-c)$.

Consequently, any displacement field obtained by superposition of such point-load responses, including the uniformly loaded disc, inherits an overall scaling factor $(1-\\nu^{2})/E$.\n- Thus, for fixed $E$, larger $\\nu$ reduces all vertical displacements proportionally through the factor $(1-\\nu^{2})$. However, the normalized spatial distribution $w(\\rho)/w(0)$ is independent of $\\nu$, because the $(1-\\nu^{2})/E$ factor cancels out in the ratio at every $\\rho$. In particular, the comparative settlement ratio for different radii at fixed $P$ is independent of $\\nu$, as derived above.\n\nTherefore, the requested ratio of central settlements for the same total load distributed over different radii is the simple dimensionless expression $\\dfrac{a_{2}}{a_{1}}$, and the role of $\\nu$ is to scale the overall magnitude of displacements without altering their normalized radial distribution on the surface under axisymmetric normal loading constructed from the Kelvin solution.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\dfrac{a_{2}}{a_{1}}}$$", "id": "2652590"}]}
