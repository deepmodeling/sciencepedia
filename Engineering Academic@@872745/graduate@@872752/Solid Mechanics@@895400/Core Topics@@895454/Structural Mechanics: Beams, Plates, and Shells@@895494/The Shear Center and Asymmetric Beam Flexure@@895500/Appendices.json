The beam axis is along $x$, and the cross-section lies in the $y$–$z$ plane. The web midline coincides with $z=0$ and extends from $y=-h/2$ to $y=+h/2$. The flanges lie at $y=\\pm h/2$ and extend from $z=0$ (at the web) to $z=b$ (free tips). The section is symmetric about the horizontal axis $y=0$.\n\nA vertical shear force $V$ acts in the $+y$ direction.

The geometry, loading conditions, and objectives are clearly defined and scientifically sound. All provided information is consistent and sufficient for deriving a unique solution from first principles. Therefore, the problem is deemed valid and a full reasoned solution is presented below.\n\nThe objective is to find the horizontal offset, $e$, of the shear center from the centroid for the given thin-walled channel section. The cross-section is symmetric about the horizontal axis $y=0$, which is therefore the horizontal centroidal axis. The applied vertical shear force $V$ is in the $+y$ direction, so bending occurs about the horizontal centroidal axis (the neutral axis).\n\nFirst, we calculate the second moment of area, $I$, about the horizontal centroidal axis ($y=0$). The cross-section consists of a vertical web and two horizontal flanges. Using the thin-walled approximation ($t \\ll h, t \\ll b$), we neglect the flanges' second moment of area about their own axes and terms of order $\\mathcal{O}(t^2)$ and higher.\nThe second moment of area of the web is:\n$$I_{\\text{web}} = \\int_{-h/2}^{h/2} y^2 (t \\, dy) = t \\left[\\frac{y^3}{3}\\right]_{-h/2}^{h/2} = \\frac{t h^3}{12}$$\nThe second moment of area of the two flanges is calculated using the parallel axis theorem, where the area of each flange is $A_f = b t$ and their distance from the $y=0$ axis is $h/2$:\n$$I_{\\text{flanges}} = 2 \\times (A_f) \\times \\left(\\frac{h}{2}\\right)^2 = 2 (b t) \\left(\\frac{h^2}{4}\\right) = \\frac{b t h^2}{2}$$\nThe total second moment of area is the sum:\n$$I = I_{\\text{web}} + I_{\\text{flanges}} = \\frac{t h^3}{12} + \\frac{b t h^2}{2} = \\frac{t h^2}{12}(h + 6b)$$\n\nNext, we determine the shear flow distribution, $q(s)$, using the formula $q = VQ/I$. Let's analyze the top flange. We define a coordinate $s$ starting from the free tip ($z=b$) and increasing towards the web ($z=0$). For a point at a distance $s$ from the tip, the first moment of area, $Q$, of the section beyond this point is:\n$$Q_{\\text{flange}}(s) = (\\text{Area}) \\times (\\text{y-distance to neutral axis}) = (s t) \\times \\left(\\frac{h}{2}\\right) = \\frac{s t h}{2}$$\nThe shear flow in the top flange is:\n$$q_{\\text{flange}}(s) = \\frac{V Q_{\\text{flange}}(s)}{I} = \\frac{V}{I} \\left(\\frac{s t h}{2}\\right) = \\frac{V t h s}{2I}$$\nThis shear flow is directed from the free tip towards the web, i.e., in the $-z$ direction. The total horizontal force, $F_f$, in the top flange is the integral of the shear flow along its width:\n$$F_f = \\int_0^b q_{\\text{flange}}(s) \\, ds = \\int_0^b \\frac{V t h s}{2I} \\, ds = \\frac{V t h}{2I} \\left[\\frac{s^2}{2}\\right]_0^b = \\frac{V t h b^2}{4I}$$\nBy symmetry, the shear flow in the bottom flange has the same magnitude distribution but is directed from the web towards the free tip (in the $+z$ direction). This results in a horizontal force of the same magnitude $F_f$ in the $+z$ direction.\n\nThese two horizontal forces, one in the top flange and one in the bottom flange, are separated by a vertical distance $h$. They form a couple, creating an internal twisting moment, $M_{\\text{int}}$, about any point in the cross-section. The magnitude of this moment is:\n$$M_{\\text{int}} = F_f \\times h = \\frac{V t h^2 b^2}{4I}$$\nThe direction of this internal moment is clockwise when viewed from the positive $x$-axis.\n\nThe shear center is the point $(y_{SC}, z_{SC})$ through which the external shear force $V$ must pass to produce bending with no twisting. By symmetry, the shear center must lie on the $y=0$ axis, so $y_{SC}=0$. The moment produced by the external force $V$ applied at the shear center must balance the internal twisting moment $M_{\\text{int}}$. Let's take moments about the centerline of the web ($z=0$). The shear flow in the web acts along this line and thus produces no moment about it. The moment from the flange forces is $M_{\\text{int}}$. The external force $V$ acting at $z=z_{SC}$ produces a moment $M_{\\text{ext}} = V \\times (-z_{SC})$ about $z=0$. The term $-z_{SC}$ is the moment arm, and it must be positive as $z_{SC}$ will be negative to produce a counter-clockwise moment to balance the clockwise $M_{int}$.\nEquating the moments:\n$$V(-z_{SC}) = M_{\\text{int}} = \\frac{V t h^2 b^2}{4I}$$\nSolving for $z_{SC}$, the horizontal coordinate of the shear center:\n$$z_{SC} = -\\frac{t h^2 b^2}{4I}$$\nSubstituting the expression for $I$:\n$$z_{SC} = -\\frac{t h^2 b^2}{4 \\left(\\frac{t h^2}{12}(h + 6b)\\right)} = -\\frac{b^2}{\\frac{1}{3}(h + 6b)} = -\\frac{3b^2}{h+6b}$$\n\nThe problem requires the offset, $e$, from the centroid to the shear center. We must first find the centroid's horizontal coordinate, $z_C$. The total area of the section is $A = A_{\\text{web}} + A_{\\text{flanges}} = ht + 2bt = t(h+2b)$. The first moment of area of the section about the $y$-axis ($z=0$) is:\n$$S_y = \\int z \\, dA = \\int_{\\text{web}} z \\, dA + \\int_{\\text{flanges}} z \\, dA$$\nThe web is at $z=0$, so its contribution is zero. For the two flanges:\n$$S_y = 2 \\times \\int_0^b z (t \\, dz) = 2t \\left[\\frac{z^2}{2}\\right]_0^b = t b^2$$\nThe centroid coordinate $z_C$ is:\n$$z_C = \\frac{S_y}{A} = \\frac{t b^2}{t(h+2b)} = \\frac{b^2}{h+2b}$$\n\nFinally, the offset $e$ is defined as the signed horizontal offset from the centroid to the shear center, positive towards negative $z$. This corresponds to $e = z_C - z_{SC}$.\n$$e = z_C - z_{SC} = \\frac{b^2}{h+2b} - \\left(-\\frac{3b^2}{h+6b}\\right) = \\frac{b^2}{h+2b} + \\frac{3b^2}{h+6b}$$\nTo combine these terms, we find a common denominator:\n$$e = b^2 \\left( \\frac{(h+6b) + 3(h+2b)}{(h+2b)(h+6b)} \\right)$$\n$$e = b^2 \\left( \\frac{h+6b+3h+6b}{(h+2b)(h+6b)} \\right) = b^2 \\left( \\frac{4h+12b}{(h+2b)(h+6b)} \\right)$$\nFactoring out a $4$ from the numerator gives the final expression for $e$:\n$$e = \\frac{4b^2(h+3b)}{(h+2b)(h+6b)}$$\nThis is the required closed-form expression for the offset of the shear center from the centroid, in terms of $b$ and $h$ only.

Consider the total strain energy $U$ of the beam under the applied end shear of fixed magnitude $V$ whose line of action is at eccentricity $e$ from a candidate point $S$ in the section. For a very slender beam, the end shear produces:\n- bending-type shear flow over the cross-section accommodating the resultant $V$, and\n- a Saint-Venant torsional moment $T=V e$ about the $z$-axis whenever the line of action does not pass through the shear center.\n\nDecomposing the total strain energy as $U=U_{b}+U_{s}+U_{t}$, where $U_{b}$ is the bending (normal-stress) energy, $U_{s}$ is the shear (bending-shear) energy, and $U_{t}$ is the Saint-Venant torsion energy, only $U_{t}$ depends on $e$ in the linear theory. Specifically, the torsional strain energy for a uniform prismatic member is\n$$\nU_{t}=\\int_{0}^{L}\\frac{T^{2}}{2 G J}\\,dx=\\frac{(V e)^{2} L}{2 G J}.\n$$\nThe bending and bending-shear parts, $U_{b}$ and $U_{s}$, depend on $V$ and the cross-section but not on $e$ because translating the line of action of a pure resultant $V$ within the cross-section does not alter the internal bending moment distribution along the beam; it only adds a torsional moment $T$.\n\nThe minimum of $U$ with respect to $e$ at fixed $V$ satisfies\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial U}{\\partial e}=\\frac{\\partial U_{t}}{\\partial e}=\\frac{V^{2} e\\, L}{G J}=0,\n$$\nwhich implies the minimizing eccentricity $e^{\\ast}=0$. Equivalently, the minimizing configuration is characterized by zero Saint-Venant torsional moment, $T=0$. This is the defining condition of the shear center $S$: it is the point in the cross-section such that when $V$ is applied through $S$, no Saint-Venant torsion and thus no twist occurs. Hence, to find $S$, we must locate the point about which the internal bending-type shear flow caused by $V$ has zero net torque.\n\n2) Thin-walled open-section shear flow under a transverse shear. For a thin-walled open section with midline coordinate $s$ and tangent along the wall, the shear flow $q(s)$ generated by a transverse shear $(V_{x},V_{y})$ in the absence of torsion satisfies the well-tested equilibrium relation\n$$\n\\frac{dq}{ds}=\\frac{V_{y}}{I_{x}}\\,t\\,(y-\\bar{y})-\\frac{V_{x}}{I_{y}}\\,t\\,(x-\\bar{x}),\n$$\nwith boundary condition $q=0$ at each free end of the open wall. This follows from balancing the incremental change in flow over an infinitesimal wall segment with the shear resultant carried by the area “accumulated” up to that point and is a standard result in thin-walled beam theory (it is the differential form of the familiar $q=VQ/(I t)$ when integrated from a free edge).\n\nWe will use two independent shear cases to characterize $S$, but because $S$ is unique, it suffices to determine that the zero-torque condition holds when $S$ coincides with the inner corner $O$ for either case. Without loss of generality, consider $V=(0,V_{y})$ acting through the point $S$ we test.\n\n3) Geometry, centroid, and moments for the $L$-section.

The $z$-component of the moment of a tangential line load $q\\,\\mathbf{t}$ at position $\\mathbf{r}=(x,y)$ is $M_{z}=\\int (x\\,q_{y}-y\\,q_{x})\\,ds$, where $q_{x}$ and $q_{y}$ are the components of the line load in the $x$ and $y$ directions, and $ds$ is the element of midline length.\n\n- On the vertical leg, the tangent is along $+\\hat{\\mathbf{y}}$, so $q_{x}=0$ and $q_{y}=q_{v}(y)$. Along this leg, $x=0$ (to leading order in $t$), hence the integrand $x\\,q_{y}$ vanishes pointwise and the vertical leg contributes zero torque about $O$.\n\n- On the horizontal leg, the tangent is along $+\\hat{\\mathbf{x}}$, so $q_{x}=q_{h}(x)$ and $q_{y}=0$. Along this leg, $y=0$ (to leading order), hence the integrand $-y\\,q_{x}$ vanishes pointwise and the horizontal leg contributes zero torque about $O$.\n\nTherefore, the total torque about $O$ produced by the bending-type shear flow for $V=(0,V_{y})$ is\n$$\nM_{z}^{(b)}(O;V_{y})=0.\n$$\nBy the same reasoning, for $V=(V_{x},0)$ the torque about $O$ is also zero. Thus, when the shear resultant acts through the corner $O$, the internal bending-type shear flow generates no net torque about $O$ for any direction of $V$, which implies that the Saint-Venant torsional moment $T$ is identically zero. This realizes the minimizing condition $e^{\\ast}=0$ from Step 1, so the shear center $S$ coincides with the inner corner $O$.\n\n5) Coordinates of the shear center relative to the centroid.
