A solution will be furnished.\n\nThe solution proceeds by first determining the strain field from the prescribed kinematics and then using the constitutive equations to find the stress field.\n\nAccording to the kinematic assumptions of Kirchhoff-Love theory, the in-plane displacement components $u(x,y,z)$ and $v(x,y,z)$ at a distance $z$ from the mid-surface are related to the mid-surface deflections $w(x,y)$ by:\n$$\nu(x,y,z) = u_0(x,y) - z \\frac{\\partial w}{\\partial x}\n$$\n$$\nv(x,y,z) = v_0(x,y) - z \\frac{\\partial w}{\\partial y}\n$$\nwhere $u_0$ and $v_0$ are the in-plane displacements of the mid-surface ($z=0$). The problem specifies no net in-plane force resultants, which for this pure bending scenario implies that the mid-surface strains are zero. This is achieved by setting $u_0=0$ and $v_0=0$.\n\nThe linear strain components $\\epsilon_{xx}$, $\\epsilon_{yy}$, and $\\gamma_{xy}$ are derived from the displacement field:\n$$\n\\epsilon_{xx} = \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x} = -z \\frac{\\partial^{2} w}{\\partial x^{2}}\n$$\n$$\n\\epsilon_{yy} = \\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial y} = -z \\frac{\\partial^{2} w}{\\partial y^{2}}\n$$\n$$\n\\gamma_{xy} = \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial y} + \\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial x} = -2z \\frac{\\partial^{2} w}{\\partial x \\partial y}\n$$\nThe prescribed deflection is $w(x,y) = \\frac{1}{2} \\kappa x^{2}$.

The problem specifies a state of plane stress, meaning $\\sigma_{zz} = 0$. The general 3D Hooke's Law for an isotropic material simplifies under plane stress to the following for the in-plane strains:\n$$\n\\epsilon_{xx} = \\frac{1}{E} (\\sigma_{xx} - \\nu \\sigma_{yy})\n$$\n$$\n\\epsilon_{yy} = \\frac{1}{E} (\\sigma_{yy} - \\nu \\sigma_{xx})\n$$\nWe have a system of two equations for the two unknown stresses, $\\sigma_{xx}$ and $\\sigma_{yy}$.

Substituting this into the second constitutive equation yields:\n$$\n0 = \\frac{1}{E} (\\sigma_{yy} - \\nu \\sigma_{xx}) \\implies \\sigma_{yy} = \\nu \\sigma_{xx}\n$$\nThis demonstrates that although the strain $\\epsilon_{yy}$ is zero, the stress $\\sigma_{yy}$ is not, due to the Poisson effect. Now, we substitute this relation into the first constitutive equation:\n$$\n\\epsilon_{xx} = \\frac{1}{E} (\\sigma_{xx} - \\nu (\\nu \\sigma_{xx})) = \\frac{\\sigma_{xx}}{E} (1 - \\nu^{2})\n$$\nSolving for $\\sigma_{xx}$ gives the stress in terms of the strain $\\epsilon_{xx}$:\n$$\n\\sigma_{xx} = \\frac{E}{1 - \\nu^{2}} \\epsilon_{xx}\n$$\nFinally, substituting the expression for the strain, $\\epsilon_{xx}(z) = -\\kappa z$, we obtain the stress distribution through the plate thickness.

If numerical values were required, stress would be in pascals, provided $E$ is in pascals and all lengths are in meters.\n\nFor the second task, we verify this result.

A solution will be derived.\n\n**Derivation**\n\nAccording to Kirchhoff–Love plate theory, the twisting moment resultant $M_{xy}$ is related to the transverse displacement $w(x,y)$ by the constitutive relation:\n$$M_{xy}(x,y) = -D(1-\\nu) \\frac{\\partial^2 w}{\\partial x \\partial y}$$\nThe flexural rigidity $D$ and the term $(1-\\nu)$ are both positive constants for any physical material (for isotropic materials, $0 \\le \\nu  0.5$). Therefore, the sign of $M_{xy}(x,y)$ is opposite to the sign of the mixed partial derivative $\\frac{\\partial^2 w}{\\partial x \\partial y}$, which represents the twist curvature of the plate surface.\n\nThe problem features a high degree of symmetry. The geometry (square), the boundary conditions (simply supported on all sides), and the loading (uniform) are all symmetric with respect to reflections about the plate's midlines, $x=a/2$ and $y=a/2$. This symmetry of the problem setup dictates that the solution for the deflection, $w(x,y)$, must also possess these symmetries.\n\nLet us analyze the consequences of the symmetry with respect to the line $x=a/2$. This symmetry means that the deflection at a point $(a/2 - \\delta, y)$ is the same as at its reflection $(a/2 + \\delta, y)$:\n$$w(a/2 - \\delta, y) = w(a/2 + \\delta, y)$$\nfor any $0 \\le \\delta \\le a/2$. In other words, $w(x,y)$ is an even function of the coordinate $x$ about the line $x=a/2$.\n\nLet's consider the partial derivative of $w$ with respect to $y$, which we denote as $v(x,y) = \\frac{\\partial w}{\\partial y}$. Differentiating the symmetry relation with respect to $y$, we find:\n$$\\frac{\\partial w}{\\partial y}(a/2 - \\delta, y) = \\frac{\\partial w}{\\partial y}(a/2 + \\delta, y)$$\nThis shows that $v(x,y)$ is also an even function of $x$ about the line $x=a/2$.\n\nNow, let's consider the derivative of $v(x,y)$ with respect to $x$. The derivative of an even function is an odd function. Therefore, $\\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial x} = \\frac{\\partial^2 w}{\\partial x \\partial y}$ must be an odd function of $x$ about the line $x=a/2$. An odd function $f(\\xi)$ about $\\xi=0$ satisfies $f(-\\xi) = -f(\\xi)$, which implies $f(0)=0$. For our case, centered at $x=a/2$, this means:\n$$\\frac{\\partial^2 w}{\\partial x \\partial y}\\bigg|_{x=a/2} = 0$$\nFurthermore, being an odd function implies that $\\frac{\\partial^2 w}{\\partial x \\partial y}$ changes sign upon crossing the line $x=a/2$.\n\nBy an identical argument, the symmetry of the problem with respect to the line $y=a/2$ implies that $w(x,y)$ is an even function of $y$ about $y=a/2$. Consequently, $\\frac{\\partial^2 w}{\\partial x \\partial y}$ must be an odd function of $y$ about the line $y=a/2$. This leads to the conclusion that:\n$$\\frac{\\partial^2 w}{\\partial x \\partial y}\\bigg|_{y=a/2} = 0$$\nand that $\\frac{\\partial^2 w}{\\partial x \\partial y}$ changes sign upon crossing the line $y=a/2$.\n\nSince $M_{xy}$ is directly proportional to $-\\frac{\\partial^2 w}{\\partial x \\partial y}$, it follows that $M_{xy}$ must vanish on both midlines, $x=a/2$ and $y=a/2$, and must change sign upon crossing either of these lines.\n\nTo determine the sign of $M_{xy}$ in the four quadrants defined by these midlines, we can examine the behavior of the plate near a corner, for example, the corner at $(0,0)$. The plate is supported at the edges but loaded downwards in the interior. This causes the corners to have a tendency to lift up. To maintain zero deflection on the supports, downward reaction forces must act at the corners. These corner forces are generated by the twisting moments. A downward force at the corner $(0,0)$ requires $M_{xy}$ to be negative there. A more formal way is to analyze the solution for $w(x,y)$ obtained via a double Fourier series (Navier's solution), which satisfies the simply supported boundary conditions ($w=0, M_n=0$ on the boundary):\n$$w(x,y) = \\sum_{m=1,3,...}^{\\infty} \\sum_{n=1,3,...}^{\\infty} W_{mn} \\sin\\left(\\frac{m\\pi x}{a}\\right) \\sin\\left(\\frac{n\\pi y}{a}\\right)$$\nwhere the coefficients $W_{mn}$ are positive for a downward load $q0$. Taking the mixed partial derivative:\n$$\\frac{\\partial^2 w}{\\partial x \\partial y} = \\sum_{m,n \\text{ odd}} W_{mn} \\left(\\frac{m\\pi}{a}\\right)\\left(\\frac{n\\pi}{a}\\right) \\cos\\left(\\frac{m\\pi x}{a}\\right) \\cos\\left(\\frac{n\\pi y}{a}\\right)$$\nIn the first quadrant, $\\{0  x  a/2, 0  y  a/2\\}$, the arguments of the cosine functions are in the interval $(0, \\pi/2)$. Thus, $\\cos(\\frac{m\\pi x}{a})  0$ and $\\cos(\\frac{n\\pi y}{a})  0$ for all $m,n$. Since $W_{mn}$ are all positive, the entire sum is positive. Therefore, $\\frac{\\partial^2 w}{\\partial x \\partial y}  0$ in this quadrant.\nThis implies $M_{xy} = -D(1-\\nu)\\frac{\\partial^2 w}{\\partial x \\partial y}  0$.\n\nFrom the odd symmetry property of $M_{xy}$ about the midlines, the full sign distribution is:\n-   In quadrant $\\{0xa/2, 0ya/2\\}$: $M_{xy}  0$.\n-   In quadrant $\\{a/2xa, 0ya/2\\}$: $M_{xy}$ must have the opposite sign to the adjacent quadrant, so $M_{xy}  0$.\n-   In quadrant $\\{0xa/2, a/2ya\\}$: $M_{xy}$ must have the opposite sign, so $M_{xy}  0$.\n-   In quadrant $\\{a/2xa, a/2ya\\}$: $M_{xy}$ must be negative, being opposite in sign to its neighbors.\n\nFinally, we consider the behavior across the diagonals. The problem's symmetries also include reflections about the diagonals $y=x$ and $y=a-x$. Symmetry about $y=x$ implies that $w(x,y) = w(y,x)$. Differentiating this relation gives $\\frac{\\partial^2 w(x,y)}{\\partial x \\partial y} = \\frac{\\partial^2 w(y,x)}{\\partial y \\partial x}$. This means the value of the mixed derivative at a point $(x,y)$ is the same as at its reflection $(y,x)$. Thus, the function $\\frac{\\partial^2 w}{\\partial x \\partial y}$ is symmetric with respect to the line $y=x$. This implies $M_{xy}$ is also symmetric, i.e., $M_{xy}(x,y) = M_{xy}(y,x)$. A function that is symmetric with respect to a line is not, in general, zero on that line, nor does it necessarily change sign. Therefore, there is no symmetry requirement for $M_{xy}$ to vanish or change sign on the diagonals.\n\n**Option-by-Option Analysis**\n\n-   **A**: This statement claims $M_{xy}$ vanishes along the diagonals and changes sign. This is incorrect. The symmetry is of an even type, not odd, with respect to the diagonals. It also incorrectly states the signs in the triangular regions. **Incorrect**.\n\n-   **B**: This statement correctly identifies that $M_{xy}$ vanishes on the midlines $x=a/2$ and $y=a/2$ and changes sign across them, due to mirror symmetries. It correctly states the sign distribution: $M_{xy}0$ in the bottom-left and top-right quadrants, and $M_{xy}0$ in the other two. It also correctly states that there is no symmetry requirement for $M_{xy}$ to vanish or change sign across the diagonals. This aligns perfectly with our derivation. **Correct**.\n\n-   **C**: This statement claims $M_{xy}$ is identically zero. This is a naive interpretation of symmetry and is incorrect. The series solution explicitly shows that $M_{xy}$ is non-zero. For instance, at the corners, $M_{xy}$ takes on its maximum absolute values. **Incorrect**.\n\n-   **D**: This statement claims $M_{xy}=0$ along the simply supported edges. This is false; the Fourier series for $M_{xy}$ on an edge is not identically zero. It also incorrectly claims there is no interior line where $M_{xy}$ must vanish, contradicting the proven fact that it vanishes on the midlines $x=a/2$ and $y=a/2$. **Incorrect**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2691494"}]}
