No numerical rounding is required.", "solution": "The problem statement is subjected to validation and is found to be valid. It is a well-posed, scientifically grounded problem from the field of solid mechanics. All necessary data and definitions are provided, and there are no internal contradictions or ambiguities. The problem requires the derivation of the internal bending moment in a cantilever beam using fundamental principles of static equilibrium.\n\nThe derivation proceeds as follows. We will analyze a free-body diagram of a portion of the beam and apply the equilibrium equations.\n\nThe problem specifies the analysis of the free body of the segment to the right of a cut at an arbitrary position $x=a$, where $0 \\le a \\le L$. This segment spans from $x=a$ to the free end at $x=L$.\n\nThe forces and moments acting on this free-body segment are:\n$1$. The external point load of magnitude $P$ applied at the free end, $x=L$. This force acts in the negative $y$-direction (downwards).\n$2$. The internal actions at the cut face at $x=a$. These are the effects of the left portion of the beam (from $x=0$ to $x=a$) on the right portion. These actions consist of an internal shear force, which we denote as $V(a)$, and an internal bending moment, $M(a)$.\n\nThe problem requires a specific sign convention for the bending moment $M(a)$: a positive value of $M(a)$ must correspond to a hogging action, which means the top fibers of the beam are in tension. For a horizontal beam, this corresponds to the beam being bent into a shape that is concave down. Let us analyze the direction of the moment vector $M(a)$ on our chosen free body (the right segment). A hogging moment is one that would cause tension in the top fibers of the material to the left of the cut. This requires a clockwise moment couple to be acting on the face of the left segment at $x=a$. By Newton's third law, the moment exerted by the left segment on the right segment must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction. Therefore, the internal moment $M(a)$ on the free-body diagram of the right segment is a counter-clockwise moment.\n\nThe problem further states that for the purpose of writing equilibrium equations, counter-clockwise moments are to be taken as positive. This is consistent with our finding; a physically positive (hogging) moment $M(a)$ corresponds to a mathematically positive (counter-clockwise) term in the equilibrium equation.\n\nWe now apply the condition of static rotational equilibrium to the free-body segment. The sum of moments about any point must be zero. We choose to sum the moments about the point located at the cut, $(x=a, y=0)$. This choice is strategic as the internal shear force $V(a)$ passes through this point, and thus its moment is zero, simplifying the equation.\n\nThe rotational equilibrium equation is:\n$$ \\sum M_{\\text{at } x=a} = 0 $$\n\nThe moments acting on the segment are:\n$1$. The internal bending moment $M(a)$ at the cut. According to our sign convention, we consider it positive, so it contributes $+M(a)$ to the sum.\n$2$. The moment produced by the external load $P$. The force $P$ acts at $x=L$. The lever arm of this force with respect to the point $x=a$ is the distance $(L-a)$. Since the force $P$ is directed downwards, it creates a clockwise moment about $x=a$. In a system where counter-clockwise is positive, this moment is negative. Its value is $-P(L-a)$.\n\nSubstituting these terms into the equilibrium equation gives:\n$$ M(a) - P(L-a) = 0 $$\n\nSolving for the internal bending moment $M(a)$, we obtain the expression:\n$$ M(a) = P(L-a) $$\n\nThis is the closed-form expression for the internal bending moment at any section $x=a$ along the cantilever beam. It is expressed in terms of the given parameters $P$, $L$, and $a$. The units are Newton-meters, as required, since $P$ is in Newtons and $(L-a)$ is in meters. The expression correctly shows that the moment is maximum at the fixed support ($a=0$), where $M(0) = PL$, and zero at the free end ($a=L$), where $M(L) = 0$. Since $P>0$ and $L \\ge a$, the value of $M(a)$ is non-negative, which is consistent with the physical expectation that a downward end load on a cantilever beam produces a hogging moment throughout its length.", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{P(L-a)} $$", "id": "2617201"}, {"introduction": "With the internal bending moment established, we can now predict the beam's physical deformation.

Its derivative, the slope $\\theta(x)$, is a quadratic function, and its second derivative, the curvature $\\kappa(x)$, is a linear function of $x$. The curvature is proportional to the moment, which decreases linearly from a maximum at the clamped support ($x=0$) to zero at the free end ($x=L$). Consequently, the rate of change of the slope is greatest near the support and diminishes towards the tip. This means the slope accumulates most rapidly in the region nearest the support.

One-point reduced integration of only the shear term can introduce a zero-energy (hourglass) mode in meshes of more than one element if no stabilization or mixed/assumed-strain projection is used, but for the single-element clamped cantilever no such mode is activated by the boundary conditions.**\n\nA zero-energy mode is a non-trivial deformation pattern that produces zero strain energy. For the reduced-integration element, the energy is zero if both bending and shear strains are zero at their integration points. For a general two-node element, this means $\\theta'(x) = 0$ (constant everywhere) and $\\gamma(L/2)=0$.\n$1$. Bending strain: $\\theta' = (\\theta_2-\\theta_1)/L = 0 \\implies \\theta_1 = \\theta_2$.\n$2$. Shear strain at midpoint: $\\gamma(L/2) = (w_2-w_1)/L - (\\theta_1+\\theta_2)/2 = 0$.\nSubstituting $\\theta_1=\\theta_2$ into the shear strain condition gives $(w_2-w_1)/L - \\theta_1 = 0$, or $w_2-w_1 = L\\theta_1$.\nThis defines the spurious shear mode. For our specific clamped cantilever problem, the boundary conditions are $w_1=0$ and $\\theta_1=0$.\nApplying these BCs to the zero-energy mode conditions:\n$\\theta_1=0 \\implies \\theta_2=0$.\n$w_2-w_1 = L\\theta_1 \\implies w_2-0 = L \\cdot 0 \\implies w_2=0$.\nThus, the only way for the mode to exist is if all DOFs are zero, which is the trivial solution. The clamped boundary condition has constrained, or \"locked out,\" the zero-energy mode. In a larger mesh, especially with unconstrained boundaries, this mode can manifest and pollute the solution.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**D. A consistent alternative to reduced/selective integration that avoids both locking and potential hourglassing is a mixed formulation or assumed-strain method in which the shear strain $\\gamma(x) = w'(x) - \\theta(x)$ is interpolated in a lower-order space and statically condensed, equivalently projecting $\\gamma$ in an average sense; this restores consistency and optimal convergence.**\n\nThis statement accurately describes a class of modern, advanced finite element techniques. Mixed formulations treat strains as independent fields, enforcing compatibility through Lagrange multipliers. Assumed-strain methods directly modify the strain-displacement matrix $\\mathbf{B}$ by assuming a lower-order strain field within the element. For the linear element discussed, assuming a constant shear strain $\\gamma_0$ throughout the element and relating it to the nodal displacements via an integral projection leads to a formulation identical to that from one-point reduced integration. However, the theoretical framework is more general and powerful. These methods are designed to satisfy the inf-sup (or LBB) stability condition, which provides mathematical proof against both locking and spurious zero-energy modes, thereby restoring optimal convergence rates. The statement is a correct and standard summary of these advanced methods.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**E. Replacing the shear correction factor $\\kappa$ by a smaller empirical value while keeping full integration for the shear term alleviates locking without compromising variational consistency or mesh convergence, and is therefore a reliable remedy for slender beams.**\n\nThe shear correction factor $\\kappa$ (e.g., $\\kappa=5/6$ for a rectangular section) is a physically-derived parameter meant to equate the strain energy of the one-dimensional Timoshenko beam with that of the full three-dimensional elastic body under pure shear. Arbitrarily altering $\\kappa$ to fix a locking problem caused by a poor choice of interpolation functions is an ad-hoc procedure. It breaks the link between the numerical model and the physical theory it is supposed to represent. This compromises variational consistency, as the modified energy functional no longer corresponds to the original beam theory. While it might \"work\" for a particular problem or mesh, it is not a robust or reliable method, and its convergence properties are not guaranteed to be optimal or even predictable. Such a technique is generally considered poor practice in modern computational mechanics.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{ABCD}$$", "id": "2617166"}]}
