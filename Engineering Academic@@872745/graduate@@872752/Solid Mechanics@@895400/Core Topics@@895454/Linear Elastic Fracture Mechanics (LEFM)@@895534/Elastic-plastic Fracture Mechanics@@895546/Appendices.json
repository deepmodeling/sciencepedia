The $J$-integral is defined as the energy release rate in a non-linear elastic material. For a linear elastic material, the energy release rate is denoted by $G$. Under the assumption that the material behavior is linear elastic, the $J$-integral is equivalent to $G$.\n$$J = G$$\nFor a mode I crack in an isotropic linear elastic material under plane strain conditions, the energy release rate $G$ is related to the stress intensity factor $K_I$ by the following expression:\n$$G = \\frac{1 - \\nu^2}{E} K_I^2$$\nwhere $E$ is the Young's modulus and $\\nu$ is the Poisson's ratio.\n\nThe problem specifies small-scale yielding. This assumption is crucial. It implies that the region of plastic deformation at the crack tip is small and contained within a much larger, surrounding elastic field. This remote elastic field is uniquely characterized by the stress intensity factor $K_I$. Because the $J$-integral is path-independent, we can evaluate it along a contour far from the crack tip, residing entirely within the region of elastic behavior. On such a contour, the material is effectively linear elastic, and the relationship between $J$ and the far-field parameter $K_I$ must be the same as the linear elastic one. Therefore, for small-scale yielding in plane strain, the appropriate correlation is:\n$$J = \\frac{1 - \\nu^2}{E} K_I^2$$\nThis relation connects the elastic-plastic parameter $J$, which characterizes the near-tip fields (the HRR fields), to the linear elastic parameter $K_I$, which characterizes the remote loading.\n\nNext, we use this correlation to estimate the value of $J$. The given values are:\n$K_I = 50\\,\\text{MPa}\\sqrt{\\text{m}} = 50 \\times 10^6\\,\\text{Pa}\\,\\text{m}^{1/2}$\n$E = 210\\,\\text{GPa} = 210 \\times 10^9\\,\\text{Pa}$\n$\\nu = 0.30$\n\nSubstituting these values into the equation for $J$:\n$$J = \\frac{1 - (0.30)^2}{210 \\times 10^9\\,\\text{Pa}} (50 \\times 10^6\\,\\text{Pa}\\,\\text{m}^{1/2})^2$$\n$$J = \\frac{1 - 0.09}{210 \\times 10^9} (2500 \\times 10^{12})\\,\\frac{\\text{Pa}^2 \\cdot \\text{m}}{\\text{Pa}}$$\n$$J = \\frac{0.91 \\times 2500 \\times 10^{12}}{210 \\times 10^9}\\,\\text{Pa} \\cdot \\text{m}$$\nThe units of $\\text{Pa} \\cdot \\text{m}$ are equivalent to $(\\text{N}/\\text{m}^2) \\cdot \\text{m} = \\text{N} \\cdot \\text{m} / \\text{m}^2 = \\text{J}/\\text{m}^2$.\n$$J = \\frac{2275}{210} \\times 10^3\\,\\frac{\\text{J}}{\\text{m}^2}$$\n$$J \\approx 10.8333... \\times 10^3\\,\\frac{\\text{J}}{\\text{m}^2}$$\nThe problem requires the answer in units of $\\text{kJ}/\\text{m}^2$.\n$$J \\approx 10.8333...\\,\\frac{\\text{kJ}}{\\text{m}^2}$$\nRounding to four significant figures gives $J = 10.83\\,\\text{kJ}/\\text{m}^2$.\n\nNow, we must justify the small-scale yielding assumption by estimating the plastic zone size. We use a standard Irwin-based estimate for the plane strain plastic zone size, $r_p$. This size can be approximated by considering the region where the effective stress exceeds the yield strength, $\\sigma_y$. A commonly used estimate for the maximum extent of the plastic zone under plane strain is:\n$$r_p \\approx \\frac{1}{3\\pi} \\left(\\frac{K_I}{\\sigma_y}\\right)^2$$\nWe are given $K_I = 50\\,\\text{MPa}\\sqrt{\\text{m}}$ and the yield strength $\\sigma_y = 500\\,\\text{MPa}$.\nThe ratio $\\frac{K_I}{\\sigma_y}$ is:\n$$\\frac{K_I}{\\sigma_y} = \\frac{50\\,\\text{MPa}\\sqrt{\\text{m}}}{500\\,\\text{MPa}} = 0.1\\,\\text{m}^{1/2}$$\nNow, we calculate the plastic zone size:\n$$r_p \\approx \\frac{1}{3\\pi} (0.1\\,\\text{m}^{1/2})^2 = \\frac{0.01}{3\\pi}\\,\\text{m} \\approx 0.00106\\,\\text{m}$$\nThis corresponds to a plastic zone size of approximately $1.06\\,\\text{mm}$. The condition for small-scale yielding is that this plastic zone size must be much smaller than other relevant geometric dimensions of the cracked body, such as the crack length $a$ and the ligament width. Since the problem describes a \"wide plate,\" we can assume that its characteristic dimensions are orders of magnitude larger than $1.06\\,\\text{mm}$ (e.g., several centimeters). Therefore, the condition $r_p \\ll a$ is satisfied, and the assumption of small-scale yielding is justified.\n\nFinally, we discuss the implications of this estimate and the hardening exponent $n$ on the accuracy of the $J-K$ correlation. The correlation $J = (1 - \\nu^2)K_I^2/E$ is fundamentally a linear elastic concept extended to an elastic-plastic material under the restrictive assumption of SSY. Its accuracy depends directly on the validity of this assumption.\n\nThe primary factor governing the accuracy is the size of the plastic zone, $r_p$, relative to a characteristic geometric length, $L$ (e.g., crack length $a$). As long as the ratio $r_p/L$ is small (typically less than $0.02 - 0.05$), the remote elastic $K_I$-field remains largely unperturbed by the crack-tip plasticity, and it correctly dictates the energy flow rate, $J$, into the plastic zone. Our estimate of $r_p \\approx 1.06\\,\\text{mm}$ supports this condition for a typical 'wide plate' geometry. If the load (and thus $K_I$) were to increase, $r_p$ would grow quadratically, and the SSY assumption, along with the accuracy of the $J-K$ correlation, would eventually break down. At that point, $J$ would become greater than the value predicted from $K_I$.\n\nThe hardening exponent $n=10$ characterizes the material's post-yield behavior within the HRR field. The stresses in the HRR solution are singular as $r^{-1/(n+1)}$, which for $n=10$ is $r^{-1/11}$. A larger value of $n$ signifies a material that strain-hardens less (approaching elastic-perfectly plastic behavior as $n \\to \\infty$). This affects the distribution and magnitude of stress and strain *within* the plastic zone. However, for a fixed $J$, the internal field structure changes with $n$, but the validity of the SSY $J-K$ correlation itself is not strongly dependent on $n$. The correlation connects the far-field loading ($K_I$) to the near-tip field amplitude ($J$). As long as the plasticity is contained (SSY holds), this connection is robust. The value of $n$ is critical for describing the state inside the plastic zone and becomes particularly important when SSY breaks down and more complex elastic-plastic analyses are required, but it is a secondary factor affecting the accuracy of the $J-K$ relationship within the SSY regime. The dominant constraint on accuracy remains the relative size of the plastic zone.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{10.83}$$", "id": "2634215"}, {"introduction": "While the $J$-integral is a powerful theoretical construct, its physical significance is best grasped by relating it to a tangible quantity: the size of the plastic zone at the crack tip.

Round your reported $ \\eta $ to three significant figures.", "solution": "The core of the problem is to establish a characteristic length scale associated with the plastic deformation zone near a crack tip. Within the framework of elastic-plastic fracture mechanics, the HRR field solution describes the asymptotic stress and strain distributions near the crack tip. The intensity of this field is characterized by the $J$-integral. For a material that exhibits plastic flow, the yield stress, $\\sigma_y$, represents the material's intrinsic resistance to the onset of significant plastic deformation. Therefore, the essential physical quantities that govern the scale of the plastic zone are the driving force, characterized by $J$, and the material resistance, characterized by $\\sigma_y$.\n\nWe will use dimensional analysis to construct a length scale from these two parameters. Let the fundamental physical dimensions be mass ($M$), length ($L$), and time ($T$).\n\nThe $J$-integral has units of energy per unit area. Energy has dimensions of force times distance, and force has dimensions of mass times acceleration.\n$$[J] = \\frac{[\\text{Energy}]}{[\\text{Area}]} = \\frac{[F][L]}{[L]^2} = \\frac{[M][L][T]^{-2}[L]}{[L]^2} = [M][T]^{-2}$$\nThe given units are $\\text{N/m}$, which correspond to force per unit length, confirming this dimensional form.\n\nThe yield stress, $\\sigma_y$, has units of force per unit area (pressure).\n$$[\\sigma_y] = \\frac{[\\text{Force}]}{[\\text{Area}]} = \\frac{[M][L][T]^{-2}}{[L]^2} = [M][L]^{-1}[T]^{-2}$$\nThe given units are $\\text{MPa}$, which are equivalent to $10^6\\,\\text{N/m}^2$, confirming this dimensional form.\n\nWe seek a characteristic length scale, $r_p$, which must have the dimension of length, $[L]$. Let us propose a relationship of the form $r_p \\propto J^a \\sigma_y^b$, where $a$ and $b$ are exponents to be determined. The dimensions must be consistent:\n$$[L]^1 [M]^0 [T]^0 = ([M][T]^{-2})^a ([M][L]^{-1}[T]^{-2})^b$$\n$$[L]^1 [M]^0 [T]^0 = [M]^a [T]^{-2a} [M]^b [L]^{-b} [T]^{-2b}$$\n$$[L]^1 [M]^0 [T]^0 = [M]^{a+b} [L]^{-b} [T]^{-2(a+b)}$$\nBy equating the exponents for each fundamental dimension, we obtain a system of linear equations:\n1. For mass ($M$): $a + b = 0$\n2. For length ($L$): $-b = 1$\n3. For time ($T$): $-2(a+b) = 0$\n\nFrom equation (2), we find $b = -1$. Substituting this into equation (1) gives $a + (-1) = 0$, which yields $a = 1$. Equation (3) is satisfied by these values, confirming consistency.\nTherefore, the only combination of $J$ and $\\sigma_y$ that produces a quantity with the dimension of length is $J^1 \\sigma_y^{-1} = J/\\sigma_y$.\nThis leads to the definition of the characteristic plastic length scale:\n$$r_p = C \\frac{J}{\\sigma_y}$$\nwhere $C$ is a dimensionless constant of order unity. For a \"crude estimate\" as requested, we take $C=1$, yielding the widely used definition:\n$$r_p = \\frac{J}{\\sigma_y}$$\nThis length scale represents the size of the region where stresses are elevated to the order of the yield stress and where substantial plastic dissipation occurs.\n\nNext, we form the dimensionless measure $\\eta$ by normalizing this length scale by the relevant geometric dimension of the specimen, which is the uncracked ligament $b$:\n$$\\eta = \\frac{r_p}{b} = \\frac{J}{b \\sigma_y}$$\nThe condition of small-scale yielding (SSY) is applicable when the zone of plasticity is much smaller than the characteristic geometric dimensions of the cracked body. In this case, the condition is $r_p \\ll b$, which is equivalent to $\\eta \\ll 1$. If this condition holds, the plastic zone is considered to be confined or \"contained\" by a surrounding elastic field, and linear elastic fracture mechanics concepts remain approximately valid for describing the far-field.\n\nWe now compute the values of $r_p$ and $\\eta$ using the provided data. It is critical to use a consistent set of units.

The calculated value $\\eta = 0.000125$ is substantially less than unity ($\\eta \\ll 1$). This indicates that the characteristic plastic length scale $r_p$ is more than three orders of magnitude smaller than the uncracked ligament $b$. Specifically, $b/r_p = 20 / 0.0025 = 8000$. The plastic deformation is therefore highly localized to a very small region near the crack tip, embedded within a much larger, predominantly elastic body. Consequently, the assumption of small-scale yielding is very likely to be valid for this specimen at this load level.\n\nThe problem requires the final answer for $\\eta$ to be rounded to three significant figures. The calculated value $0.000125$ has exactly three significant figures ($1$, $2$, $5$).

Under these conditions, the J-integral, $J$, serves as the single parameter that characterizes the intensity of the near-tip fields.\n\nThe fundamental parameters governing the local mechanical state are the loading intensity, $J$, which has units of energy per unit area or force per unit length ($[F][L]^{-1}$), and the material's resistance to plastic flow, represented by the uniaxial yield stress, $\\sigma_{y}$, which has units of force per unit area ($[F][L]^{-2}$).
