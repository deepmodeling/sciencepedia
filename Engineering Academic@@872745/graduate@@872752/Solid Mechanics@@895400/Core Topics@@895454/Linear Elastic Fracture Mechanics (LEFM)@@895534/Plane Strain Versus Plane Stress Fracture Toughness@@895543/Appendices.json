The problem is well-posed, self-contained, and objective. It provides all necessary information to apply the established criterion for a valid $K_{Ic}$ measurement. No contradictions, ambiguities, or factual inaccuracies are present.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. A complete solution will be provided.\n\n**Solution Derivation**\nThe fundamental premise of linear elastic fracture mechanics (LEFM) is that the plastic deformation at the crack tip is confined to a zone that is small compared to the overall dimensions of the specimen and the crack length. This is the condition of \"small-scale yielding.\"\n\nThe state of stress at the crack tip dictates the fracture behavior. A thin specimen allows for through-thickness contraction, leading to a state of plane stress ($\\sigma_{zz} \\approx 0$). A thick specimen constrains this out-of-plane deformation, inducing a triaxial state of stress near the crack tip where $\\sigma_{zz} \\approx \\nu(\\sigma_{xx}+\\sigma_{yy})$. This is a state of plane strain ($\\epsilon_{zz} = 0$). This triaxial stress state elevates the local stress required for yielding and reduces the size of the plastic zone, promoting brittle fracture.\n\nThe plane-strain fracture toughness, $K_{Ic}$, is considered a true material property, independent of specimen geometry, provided that plane-strain conditions dominate at fracture. To ensure this, standardized testing procedures, such as ASTM E399, impose a minimum requirement on the specimen thickness, $B$.\n\nThe size of the plastic zone, $r_p$, ahead of the crack tip can be estimated. For plane stress conditions, the radius of the plastic zone is approximated by the Irwin model as:\n$$ r_p \\approx \\frac{1}{2\\pi} \\left( \\frac{K_I}{\\sigma_y} \\right)^2 $$\nFor a measurement to be considered a valid $K_{Ic}$, the specimen thickness $B$ (and also the crack length $a$) must be significantly larger than the plastic zone size to ensure through-thickness constraint. The empirically established criterion for ensuring dominant plane-strain conditions is:\n$$ B \\geq 2.5 \\left( \\frac{K_{Ic}}{\\sigma_y} \\right)^2 $$\nThis requirement ensures that the plastic zone size is a small fraction of the specimen thickness, thereby maintaining the triaxial constraint necessary for a plane-strain condition.\n\nThe problem asks for the minimum required specimen thickness, $B_{min}$, for the given material properties. We use the limiting case of the inequality:\n$$ B_{min} = 2.5 \\left( \\frac{K_{Ic}}{\\sigma_y} \\right)^2 $$\nWe are given the values:\n- $K_{Ic} = 50\\,\\text{MPa}\\sqrt{\\text{m}}$\n- $\\sigma_y = 800\\,\\text{MPa}$\n\nSubstituting these values into the equation:\n$$ B_{min} = 2.5 \\left( \\frac{50\\,\\text{MPa}\\sqrt{\\text{m}}}{800\\,\\text{MPa}} \\right)^2 $$\nThe units $\\text{MPa}$ cancel out, leaving the result in meters:\n$$ B_{min} = 2.5 \\left( \\frac{50}{800} \\right)^2 \\text{m} $$\n$$ B_{min} = 2.5 \\left( \\frac{1}{16} \\right)^2 \\text{m} $$\n$$ B_{min} = 2.5 \\left( \\frac{1}{256} \\right) \\text{m} $$\n$$ B_{min} \\approx 0.009765625\\,\\text{m} $$\nThe problem requires the answer to be expressed in millimeters.

Your solution must adhere to the following modeling framework, which is grounded in first principles and dimensional consistency.\n\nBase the derivation on these fundamental facts:\n- Griffith energy balance equates the energy release rate $G$ to the crack driving force, with the Linear Elastic Fracture Mechanics (LEFM) relation $G = K^2/E^{\\prime}$, where $E^{\\prime}$ is the effective elastic modulus for the prevailing stress state.\n- In a cohesive zone model with fixed work of separation per unit new crack area $W_0$ (the area under the traction–separation law), the intrinsic material toughness $G_c$ equals $W_0$, independent of thickness.\n- Reduced crack-tip constraint with decreasing thickness transitions the elastic response between plane strain and plane stress and increases the efficacy of cohesive-zone shielding.
