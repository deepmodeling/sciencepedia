It is well-posed; the givens are sufficient and consistent for deriving a unique solution for the requested quantities. The material properties are realistic for a metallic material like steel. The crucial assumption of a constant stress ratio $\\kappa = -4$ in the plastic zone is explicitly stated as an empirical in-situ measurement and is to be taken as given. While a simplification, it does not introduce a logical contradiction or scientific fallacy; instead, it provides a definite path to a solution for the specified stress state, bypassing a full incremental analysis. The problem is objective and all terms are formally defined. It is not trivial and requires correct application of fundamental principles.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is deemed **valid**. A solution will be formulated.\n\nThe solution proceeds in two parts as requested: first, the derivation of the equivalent plastic strain distribution, and second, the computation of the total plastic work per unit length.\n\nThe analysis begins with the axisymmetric radial equilibrium equation in cylindrical coordinates, with no body forces:\n$$ \\frac{d\\sigma_r}{dr} + \\frac{\\sigma_r - \\sigma_\\theta}{r} = 0 $$\nThe problem states that within the plastic annulus ($a \\le r \\le c$), the stress ratio $\\sigma_\\theta(r)/\\sigma_r(r) = \\kappa = -4$ is constant. Substituting $\\sigma_\\theta = -4\\sigma_r$ into the equilibrium equation yields:\n$$ \\frac{d\\sigma_r}{dr} + \\frac{\\sigma_r - (-4\\sigma_r)}{r} = 0 \\implies \\frac{d\\sigma_r}{dr} + \\frac{5\\sigma_r}{r} = 0 $$\nThis is a separable first-order ordinary differential equation. Separating variables and integrating:\n$$ \\frac{d\\sigma_r}{\\sigma_r} = -5 \\frac{dr}{r} \\implies \\int \\frac{d\\sigma_r}{\\sigma_r} = -5 \\int \\frac{dr}{r} \\implies \\ln|\\sigma_r| = -5\\ln|r| + \\ln(C_1) $$\nwhere $\\ln(C_1)$ is the constant of integration. This gives the solution for the radial stress distribution:\n$$ \\sigma_r(r) = C_1 r^{-5} $$\nThe von Mises equivalent stress, $\\sigma_{eq}$, under plane stress conditions ($\\sigma_z = 0$) is defined as:\n$$ \\sigma_{eq} = \\sqrt{\\sigma_r^2 + \\sigma_\\theta^2 - \\sigma_r \\sigma_\\theta} $$\nSubstituting $\\sigma_\\theta = -4\\sigma_r$:\n$$ \\sigma_{eq} = \\sqrt{\\sigma_r^2 + (-4\\sigma_r)^2 - \\sigma_r(-4\\sigma_r)} = \\sqrt{\\sigma_r^2 + 16\\sigma_r^2 + 4\\sigma_r^2} = \\sqrt{21\\sigma_r^2} = \\sqrt{21}|\\sigma_r| $$\nFor a cylinder under internal pressure, the radial stress is compressive, so $\\sigma_r < 0$ and $|\\sigma_r| = -\\sigma_r$. Thus:\n$$ \\sigma_{eq}(r) = -\\sqrt{21} \\sigma_r(r) = -\\sqrt{21} C_1 r^{-5} $$\nThe constant $C_1$ is determined from the condition at the elastic-plastic interface, $r=c$. At this radius, plastic deformation has just begun, so the equivalent plastic strain $\\varepsilon_{p}^{eq}(c) = 0$. According to the linear hardening law, the equivalent stress must be equal to the initial yield stress:\n$$ \\sigma_{eq}(c) = \\sigma_{y0} + H \\varepsilon_{p}^{eq}(c) = \\sigma_{y0} $$\nEquating this with the expression for $\\sigma_{eq}(c)$:\n$$ \\sigma_{y0} = -\\sqrt{21} C_1 c^{-5} \\implies C_1 = -\\frac{\\sigma_{y0} c^5}{\\sqrt{21}} $$\nSubstituting $C_1$ back into the expression for $\\sigma_{eq}(r)$:\n$$ \\sigma_{eq}(r) = -\\sqrt{21} \\left(-\\frac{\\sigma_{y0} c^5}{\\sqrt{21}}\\right) r^{-5} = \\sigma_{y0} \\left(\\frac{c}{r}\\right)^5 $$\nThis is the distribution of equivalent stress in the plastic annulus $a \\le r \\le c$.\n\nNow, we derive the equivalent plastic strain distribution, $\\varepsilon_{p}^{eq}(r)$, using the linear hardening law $\\sigma_{eq} = \\sigma_{y0} + H\\varepsilon_{p}^{eq}$:\n$$ \\varepsilon_{p}^{eq}(r) = \\frac{\\sigma_{eq}(r) - \\sigma_{y0}}{H} = \\frac{\\sigma_{y0}\\left(\\frac{c}{r}\\right)^5 - \\sigma_{y0}}{H} $$\n$$ \\varepsilon_{p}^{eq}(r) = \\frac{\\sigma_{y0}}{H} \\left[ \\left(\\frac{c}{r}\\right)^5 - 1 \\right] $$\nThis completes the first part of the problem.\n\nFor the second part, we compute the total plastic work per unit axial length, $W_p$. This is found by integrating the plastic work density, $w_p(r)$, over the area of the plastic annulus.\n$$ W_p = \\int_{A_p} w_p(r) \\, dA = \\int_a^c w_p(r) (2\\pi r) \\, dr $$\nThe plastic work density $w_p(r)$ is given by the integral of the equivalent stress over the equivalent plastic strain:\n$$ w_p(r) = \\int_0^{\\varepsilon_{p}^{eq}(r)} \\sigma_{eq}(\\varepsilon) \\, d\\varepsilon = \\int_0^{\\varepsilon_{p}^{eq}(r)} (\\sigma_{y0} + H\\varepsilon) \\, d\\varepsilon = \\sigma_{y0} \\varepsilon_{p}^{eq}(r) + \\frac{1}{2} H \\left(\\varepsilon_{p}^{eq}(r)\\right)^2 $$\nAn alternative and simpler expression for $w_p(r)$ can be found by substituting $\\varepsilon_{p}^{eq} = (\\sigma_{eq} - \\sigma_{y0})/H$:\n$$ w_p(r) = \\sigma_{y0} \\frac{\\sigma_{eq}(r) - \\sigma_{y0}}{H} + \\frac{1}{2} H \\left(\\frac{\\sigma_{eq}(r) - \\sigma_{y0}}{H}\\right)^2 = \\frac{1}{2H} \\left[2\\sigma_{y0}\\sigma_{eq}(r) - 2\\sigma_{y0}^2 + \\sigma_{eq}(r)^2 - 2\\sigma_{y0}\\sigma_{eq}(r) + \\sigma_{y0}^2\\right] $$\n$$ w_p(r) = \\frac{1}{2H} \\left( \\sigma_{eq}(r)^2 - \\sigma_{y0}^2 \\right) $$\nUsing $\\sigma_{eq}(r) = \\sigma_{y0} (c/r)^5$:\n$$ w_p(r) = \\frac{1}{2H} \\left[ \\left(\\sigma_{y0} \\left(\\frac{c}{r}\\right)^5\\right)^2 - \\sigma_{y0}^2 \\right] = \\frac{\\sigma_{y0}^2}{2H} \\left[ \\left(\\frac{c}{r}\\right)^{10} - 1 \\right] $$\nWe can now integrate to find $W_p$:\n$$ W_p = \\int_a^c \\frac{\\sigma_{y0}^2}{2H} \\left[ \\left(\\frac{c}{r}\\right)^{10} - 1 \\right] (2\\pi r) \\, dr = \\frac{\\pi \\sigma_{y0}^2}{H} \\int_a^c \\left( c^{10}r^{-10} - 1 \\right) r \\, dr $$\n$$ W_p = \\frac{\\pi \\sigma_{y0}^2}{H} \\int_a^c (c^{10}r^{-9} - r) \\, dr $$\nPerforming the integration:\n$$ W_p = \\frac{\\pi \\sigma_{y0}^2}{H} \\left[ c^{10} \\frac{r^{-8}}{-8} - \\frac{r^2}{2} \\right]_a^c = \\frac{\\pi \\sigma_{y0}^2}{H} \\left[ \\left(-\\frac{c^{10}c^{-8}}{8} - \\frac{c^2}{2}\\right) - \\left(-\\frac{c^{10}a^{-8}}{8} - \\frac{a^2}{2}\\right) \\right] $$\n$$ W_p = \\frac{\\pi \\sigma_{y0}^2}{H} \\left[ -\\frac{c^2}{8} - \\frac{4c^2}{8} + \\frac{c^{10}}{8a^8} + \\frac{a^2}{2} \\right] = \\frac{\\pi \\sigma_{y0}^2}{H} \\left[ \\frac{c^{10}}{8a^8} - \\frac{5c^2}{8} + \\frac{4a^2}{8} \\right] $$\n$$ W_p = \\frac{\\pi \\sigma_{y0}^2}{8H} \\left( \\frac{c^{10}}{a^8} - 5c^2 + 4a^2 \\right) $$\nNow, we substitute the numerical values, ensuring consistent units (SI: Pascals for stress, meters for length).\n$\\sigma_{y0} = 300\\,\\text{MPa} = 3 \\times 10^8\\,\\text{Pa}$\n$H = 1.2\\,\\text{GPa} = 1.2 \\times 10^9\\,\\text{Pa}$\n$a = 0.05\\,\\text{m}$\n$c = 0.10\\,\\text{m}$\n\nFirst, evaluate the term in parenthesis, which has units of $\\text{m}^2$:\n$$ \\frac{c^{10}}{a^8} = c^2 \\left(\\frac{c}{a}\\right)^8 = (0.10\\,\\text{m})^2 \\left(\\frac{0.10}{0.05}\\right)^8 = (0.01\\,\\text{m}^2) (2^8) = 0.01 \\times 256\\,\\text{m}^2 = 2.56\\,\\text{m}^2 $$\n$$ 5c^2 = 5 \\times (0.10\\,\\text{m})^2 = 0.05\\,\\text{m}^2 $$\n$$ 4a^2 = 4 \\times (0.05\\,\\text{m})^2 = 4 \\times 0.0025\\,\\text{m}^2 = 0.01\\,\\text{m}^2 $$\nThe bracketed term is:\n$$ (2.56 - 0.05 + 0.01)\\,\\text{m}^2 = 2.52\\,\\text{m}^2 $$\nNow, calculate the pre-factor:\n$$ \\frac{\\pi \\sigma_{y0}^2}{8H} = \\frac{\\pi (3 \\times 10^8\\,\\text{Pa})^2}{8 (1.2 \\times 10^9\\,\\text{Pa})} = \\frac{\\pi \\times 9 \\times 10^{16}\\,\\text{Pa}^2}{9.6 \\times 10^9\\,\\text{Pa}} = \\frac{9\\pi}{9.6} \\times 10^7\\,\\text{Pa} $$\nThe total plastic work per unit length $W_p$ has units of $\\text{Pa} \\cdot \\text{m}^2 = (\\text{N}/\\text{m}^2) \\cdot \\text{m}^2 = \\text{N}$, which is equivalent to $\\text{J}/\\text{m}$.\n$$ W_p = \\left(\\frac{9\\pi}{9.6} \\times 10^7\\right) \\times 2.52 \\approx 7.4219 \\times 10^7\\,\\text{J/m} $$\nThe problem requires the answer in kilojoules per meter ($\\text{kJ/m}$).\n$$ W_p = 7.4219 \\times 10^7\\,\\text{J/m} = 74219\\,\\text{kJ/m} $$\nRounding to three significant figures, we get $74200\\,\\text{kJ/m}$.
