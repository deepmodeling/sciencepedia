A uniform hydrostatic pressure $p$ is applied on all bounding surfaces. A slowly increasing torque $T$ is applied about the shaft axis.

The setup is a standard combined loading problem.

A solution will be derived.\n\n**Derivation**\n\nThe state of stress at any point within the shaft is determined by the superposition of the stress states induced by the hydrostatic pressure and the applied torque.\n\n1.  **Stress from Hydrostatic Pressure:** A uniform hydrostatic pressure $p$ applied to all surfaces of an isotropic body induces a purely spherical stress state, provided the body is free of other constraints. The stress tensor due to pressure, $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}^{(p)}$, is:\n    $$\n    \\boldsymbol{\\sigma}^{(p)} = \\begin{pmatrix} -p  0  0 \\\\ 0  -p  0 \\\\ 0  0  -p \\end{pmatrix} = -p \\boldsymbol{I}\n    $$\n    where $\\boldsymbol{I}$ is the second-order identity tensor. This is true for any coordinate system.\n\n2.  **Stress from Torsion:** According to the Saint-Venant theory for pure torsion of a solid circular shaft, the only non-zero stress component in a cylindrical coordinate system $(r, \\theta, z)$ is the shear stress $\\tau_{\\theta z}$. This stress varies linearly with the radial distance $r$ from the center of the shaft:\n    $$\n    \\tau_{\\theta z}(r) = \\frac{T r}{J}\n    $$\n    where $J$ is the polar second moment of area of the circular cross-section, given by $J = \\frac{\\pi R^4}{2}$. The stress tensor due to torque, $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}^{(T)}$, is:\n    $$\n    \\boldsymbol{\\sigma}^{(T)} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0  0  0 \\\\ 0  0  \\tau_{\\theta z} \\\\ 0  \\tau_{\\theta z}  0 \\end{pmatrix}\n    $$\n\n3.  **Total Stress State:** The total Cauchy stress tensor, $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}$, is the sum $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}^{(p)} + \\boldsymbol{\\sigma}^{(T)}$:\n    $$\n    \\boldsymbol{\\sigma} = \\begin{pmatrix} -p  0  0 \\\\ 0  -p  \\tau_{\\theta z} \\\\ 0  \\tau_{\\theta z}  -p \\end{pmatrix}\n    $$\n\n4.  **Cauchy Stress Decomposition:** The problem mandates the use of stress decomposition into spherical (hydrostatic) and deviatoric parts. The stress tensor $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}$ is decomposed as $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma} = \\boldsymbol{\\sigma}_m + \\boldsymbol{s}$, where $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}_m$ is the spherical part and $\\boldsymbol{s}$ is the deviatoric part.\n    - The mean (hydrostatic) stress, $\\sigma_m$, is one-third of the trace of the stress tensor:\n      $$\n      \\sigma_m = \\frac{1}{3} \\text{tr}(\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}) = \\frac{1}{3}(\\sigma_{rr} + \\sigma_{\\theta\\theta} + \\sigma_{zz}) = \\frac{1}{3}(-p - p - p) = -p\n      $$\n    - The spherical stress tensor is $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}_m = \\sigma_m \\boldsymbol{I}$:\n      $$\n      \\boldsymbol{\\sigma}_m = \\begin{pmatrix} -p  0  0 \\\\ 0  -p  0 \\\\ 0  0  -p \\end{pmatrix}\n      $$\n      This is identical to the stress induced by the pressure alone.\n    - The deviatoric stress tensor is $\\boldsymbol{s} = \\boldsymbol{\\sigma} - \\boldsymbol{\\sigma}_m$:\n      $$\n      \\boldsymbol{s} = \\begin{pmatrix} -p  0  0 \\\\ 0  -p  \\tau_{\\theta z} \\\\ 0  \\tau_{\\theta z}  -p \\end{pmatrix} - \\begin{pmatrix} -p  0  0 \\\\ 0  -p  0 \\\\ 0  0  -p \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0  0  0 \\\\ 0  0  \\tau_{\\theta z} \\\\ 0  \\tau_{\\theta z}  0 \\end{pmatrix}\n      $$\n      This demonstrates that the deviatoric part of the stress is entirely due to the applied torque and is completely independent of the hydrostatic pressure $p$.\n\n5.  **Pressure-Insensitive Yield Criterion:** The problem states the material is \"pressure-insensitive\". This is a defining characteristic of metal plasticity. It means that the yield condition depends only on the deviatoric stress tensor $\\boldsymbol{s}$, not on the mean stress $\\sigma_m$. The von Mises yield criterion is a standard representation for such behavior. It states that yielding commences when the effective stress, $\\sigma_{\\text{eff}}$, reaches the uniaxial yield stress, $\\sigma_y$. The effective stress is defined in terms of the second invariant of the deviatoric stress tensor, $J_2 = \\frac{1}{2} s_{ij}s_{ij}$.\n    $$\n    \\sigma_{\\text{eff}} = \\sqrt{3 J_2} = \\sigma_y\n    $$\n    For our deviatoric stress tensor, $J_2$ is calculated as:\n    $$\n    J_2 = \\frac{1}{2} \\left[ (s_{rr})^2 + (s_{\\theta\\theta})^2 + (s_{zz})^2 + 2(s_{r\\theta})^2 + 2(s_{\\theta z})^2 + 2(s_{zr})^2 \\right] = \\frac{1}{2} [0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 2(\\tau_{\\theta z})^2 + 0] = \\tau_{\\theta z}^2\n    $$\n    The von Mises yield criterion thus becomes:\n    $$\n    \\sqrt{3 \\tau_{\\theta z}^2} = \\sqrt{3} |\\tau_{\\theta z}| = \\sigma_y\n    $$\n    This condition for yielding is completely independent of the hydrostatic pressure $p$. The other problem specifications, \"associative elastic-plastic flow rule with plastic incompressibility,\" are consistent with and reinforce this conclusion, as a yield function dependent only on deviatoric stress guarantees plastic incompressibility under an associative flow rule.\n\n6.  **Location and Torque at First Yield:** Yielding will first occur at the location where the yield criterion is first met. The driving term in the criterion is the shear stress $\\tau_{\\theta z}(r) = \\frac{Tr}{J}$. This value is zero at the center ($r=0$) and maximal at the outer surface of the shaft ($r=R$). Therefore, yielding must initiate at $r=R$.\n    The shear stress at the surface is $\\tau_{\\theta z}(R) = \\frac{TR}{J} = \\frac{TR}{\\pi R^4 / 2} = \\frac{2T}{\\pi R^3}$.\n    Let $T_y$ be the torque at which first yield occurs. At this point, the maximum shear stress satisfies the yield criterion:\n    $$\n    \\sqrt{3} \\left( \\frac{2T_y}{\\pi R^3} \\right) = \\sigma_y\n    $$\n    Solving for the yield torque $T_y$:\n    $$\n    T_y = \\frac{\\pi R^3}{2} \\frac{\\sigma_y}{\\sqrt{3}}\n    $$\n    This expression for $T_y$ is identical to the case of pure torsion with no hydrostatic pressure ($p=0$).\n\n**Evaluation of Options**\n\n-   **A. A confining hydrostatic pressure $p$ raises the torsional yield torque because it adds to the shear resistance. The first-yield torque is $T_y=\\dfrac{\\pi R^3}{2}\\dfrac{\\sigma_y+p}{\\sqrt{3}}$, and yielding initiates at $r=R$.**\n    The reasoning is fundamentally incorrect for a pressure-insensitive material. The formula incorrectly incorporates $p$ into the yield torque. **Incorrect**.\n\n-   **B. A confining hydrostatic pressure $p$ does not alter the torsional yield condition in a pressure-insensitive metal because yielding depends only on deviatoric stress. The first-yield torque is $T_y=\\dfrac{\\pi R^3}{2}\\dfrac{\\sigma_y}{\\sqrt{3}}$, identical to the $p=0$ case, and yielding initiates at $r=R$.**\n    The reasoning is precisely correct: for a pressure-insensitive material, yield depends only on the deviatoric stress, which is unaffected by hydrostatic pressure. The derived formula for $T_y$ and the location of first yield ($r=R$) both match our derivation perfectly. **Correct**.\n\n-   **C. A confining hydrostatic pressure $p$ lowers the torsional yield torque because it increases the compressive principal stresses. The first-yield torque is $T_y=\\dfrac{\\pi R^3}{2}\\left(\\dfrac{\\sigma_y}{\\sqrt{3}}-p\\right)$, and yielding initiates at $r=R$.**\n    The reasoning is incorrect because the effect of principal stress magnitude (and thus hydrostatic pressure) is explicitly excluded from pressure-insensitive yield criteria. The formula is incorrect. **Incorrect**.\n\n-   **D. A confining hydrostatic pressure $p$ leaves the value of $T_y$ unchanged but shifts the location of first yielding to the center $r=0$ due to radial pressure effects.**\n    The statement that $T_y$ is unchanged is correct. However, the claim that the yielding location shifts to $r=0$ is false. The driving stress for yield, $\\tau_{\\theta z}$, is zero at the center and maximum at the surface. Hydrostatic pressure does not alter this fact.

A solution will be derived.\n\nThe fundamental relationship between the applied torque $T$ and the shear stress distribution $\\tau(r)$ over a circular cross-section of radius $R$ is given by the integral of the moment due to shear stress over the area $A$. For an annular element of area $dA = 2\\pi r \\, dr$ at radius $r$, the total torque is:\n$$\nT = \\int_{A} r \\tau(r) \\, dA = \\int_{0}^{R} r \\tau(r) (2\\pi r \\, dr) = 2\\pi \\int_{0}^{R} r^2 \\tau(r) \\, dr\n$$\nThis is the required starting point.\n\nFirst, we determine the elastic limit torque, which we denote as $T_{y}$. In the elastic regime, the shear stress is proportional to the radius, $\\tau_{e}(r) = Cr$ for some constant $C$. Yielding initiates when the maximum shear stress at the outer surface ($r=R$) reaches the yield stress $\\tau_{y}$.\n$$\n\\tau_{e}(R) = CR = \\tau_{y} \\implies C = \\frac{\\tau_{y}}{R}\n$$\nThus, the stress distribution at the onset of yielding is:\n$$\n\\tau_{e}(r) = \\frac{\\tau_{y}}{R} r\n$$\nThe elastic limit torque $T_{y}$ is the torque corresponding to this stress state:\n$$\nT_{y} = 2\\pi \\int_{0}^{R} r^2 \\left(\\frac{\\tau_{y}}{R} r\\right) dr = \\frac{2\\pi\\tau_{y}}{R} \\int_{0}^{R} r^3 dr\n$$\nEvaluating the integral gives:\n$$\nT_{y} = \\frac{2\\pi\\tau_{y}}{R} \\left[ \\frac{r^4}{4} \\right]_{0}^{R} = \\frac{2\\pi\\tau_{y}}{R} \\frac{R^4}{4} = \\frac{\\pi}{2} \\tau_{y} R^3\n$$\n\nNext, we determine the fully plastic torque, $T_{p}$.

An elastic shaft of radius $R_{e}$ carrying a torque $T^{\\star}$ has a maximum shear stress at its outer surface.

The relationship between the applied torque and the resulting twist is given by the integral equilibrium equation:\n$$T(\\kappa) = 2\\pi \\int_{a}^{R} \\tau(r, \\kappa) r^2 dr$$\nwhere the shear stress $\\tau(r, \\kappa)$ under monotonic loading ($\\kappa \\ge 0$) is defined by the constitutive law:\n$$\\tau(r, \\kappa) = \\min\\big(G(r)\\gamma(r), \\tau_y(r)\\big)$$\nThe shear strain, $\\gamma(r)$, is given by the kinematic relation for Saint-Venant torsion of a circular section as $\\gamma(r) = \\kappa r$. Substituting this into the stress relation gives:\n$$\\tau(r, \\kappa) = \\min\\big(G(r)\\kappa r, \\tau_y(r)\\big)$$\nWe are tasked with finding the value of $\\kappa$ that satisfies the equation $T(\\kappa) = T_{\\mathrm{app}}$.\n\nThe problem specifies a numerical approach using a one-dimensional discretization into $N$ uniform annular cells. The integral for the torque is approximated using a midpoint quadrature rule. The cross-section is divided into $N$ annuli, each of width $\\Delta r = (R-a)/N$. The midpoint radius of the $i$-th annulus (for $i=0, \\dots, N-1$) is $r_i = a + (i + 1/2)\\Delta r$. At these midpoints, the material properties are taken as constant within each annulus, $G_i = G(r_i)$ and $\\tau_{y,i} = \\tau_y(r_i)$. The discretized stress in the $i$-th annulus is:\n$$\\tau_i(\\kappa) = \\min\\big(G_i \\kappa r_i, \\tau_{y,i}\\big)$$\nThe total torque is then approximated by the summation:\n$$T_{\\text{num}}(\\kappa) = 2\\pi \\sum_{i=0}^{N-1} \\tau_i(\\kappa) r_i^2 \\Delta r$$\nOur objective reduces to solving the nonlinear algebraic equation for $\\kappa$:\n$$f(\\kappa) = T_{\\text{num}}(\\kappa) - T_{\\mathrm{app}} = 0$$\nThe function $T_{\\text{num}}(\\kappa)$ is a monotonically non-decreasing function of $\\kappa$, since $\\tau_i(\\kappa)$ is a monotonically non-decreasing function for each $i$. This property makes the root-finding problem well-suited for the bisection method. First, we must check for feasibility. A solution for $\\kappa$ exists only if the applied torque $T_{\\mathrm{app}}$ does not exceed the fully plastic torque, $T_{\\mathrm{fp}}$. The fully plastic torque corresponds to the state where the shear stress equals the yield stress everywhere in the cross-section, $\\tau(r) = \\tau_y(r)$. Its discretized form is:\n$$T_{\\mathrm{fp}} = 2\\pi \\sum_{i=0}^{N-1} \\tau_{y,i} r_i^2 \\Delta r$$\nIf $T_{\\mathrm{app}} > T_{\\mathrm{fp}}$, no solution exists within the framework of rate-independent perfect plasticity. All test cases provided are assumed to be feasible.\n\nThe bisection algorithm requires finding a bracket $[\\kappa_a, \\kappa_b]$ such that $f(\\kappa_a)$ and $f(\\kappa_b)$ have opposite signs.\n1. A natural lower bound is $\\kappa_a = 0$. For this value, $T_{\\text{num}}(0) = 0$, so $f(0) = -T_{\\mathrm{app}}$. Since $T_{\\mathrm{app}} \\ge 0$, we have $f(0) \\le 0$.\n2. An upper bound $\\kappa_b$ must be found such that $f(\\kappa_b) > 0$, which means $T_{\\text{num}}(\\kappa_b) > T_{\\mathrm{app}}$. As long as $T_{\\mathrm{app}}  T_{\\mathrm{fp}}$, such a $\\kappa_b$ can always be found. A simple strategy is to start with a guestimate for $\\kappa_b$ and increase it (e.g., by doubling) until the condition is met.\n3. Once the bracket is established, the bisection method iteratively halves the interval while keeping the root bracketed, converging to the solution for $\\kappa$ with a specified tolerance.\n\nThis general algorithm is applied to each test case.\n\n**Case A Analysis**: $a = 0\\,\\mathrm{m}$, $R = 0.02\\,\\mathrm{m}$, $G(r) = 28\\times 10^{9} + 8\\times 10^{9}\\,\\frac{r}{R}\\ \\mathrm{Pa}$, $\\tau_{y}(r) = 200\\times 10^{6}\\ \\mathrm{Pa}$, $T_{\\mathrm{app}} = 500\\,\\mathrm{N\\cdot m}$.\nThis is a solid shaft with linearly graded shear modulus. A preliminary check can determine if yielding occurs. If the response is purely elastic, $\\tau(r) = G(r)\\kappa r$. The torque is $T_{el}(\\kappa) = \\kappa \\cdot 2\\pi \\int_0^R G(r) r^3 dr$. Evaluating this integral gives the torsional rigidity. For the given parameters, a fully elastic response would require $\\kappa \\approx 0.0578\\,\\mathrm{rad/m}$. At this twist, the maximum shear stress occurs at $r=R$ and is $\\tau_{\\max} = G(R)\\kappa R \\approx 41.6\\,\\mathrm{MPa}$, which is well below the yield stress $\\tau_y = 200\\,\\mathrm{MPa}$. Thus, the shaft remains entirely elastic, and the numerical solver should converge to the purely elastic solution.\n\n**Case B Analysis**: $a = 0.005\\,\\mathrm{m}$, $R = 0.02\\,\\mathrm{m}$, $r_c = 0.012\\,\\mathrm{m}$, piecewise constant $G(r)$, $\\tau_y = 120\\,\\mathrm{MPa}$, $T_{\\mathrm{app}} = 1600\\,\\mathrm{N\\cdot m}$.\nThis is a hollow composite shaft. The fully plastic torque is $T_{\\mathrm{fp}} \\approx 1979\\,\\mathrm{N\\cdot m}$. The torque at which first yield occurs (at $r=R$) is $T_{yield} \\approx 1448\\,\\mathrm{N\\cdot m}$. Since $T_{yield}  T_{\\mathrm{app}}  T_{\\mathrm{fp}}$, the shaft is partially yielded. An analytical solution is cumbersome, validating the necessity of the numerical approach.\n\n**Case C Analysis**: $a = 0\\,\\mathrm{m}$, $R = 0.02\\,\\mathrm{m}$, $G=30\\,\\mathrm{GPa}$, $\\tau_y=100\\,\\mathrm{MPa}$, $T_{\\mathrm{app}}=1600\\,\\mathrm{N\\cdot m}$.\nThis is a solid shaft with uniform properties. The fully plastic torque is $T_{\\mathrm{fp}} = 2\\pi\\tau_y R^3 / 3 \\approx 1675.5\\,\\mathrm{N\\cdot m}$. The applied torque $T_{\\mathrm{app}}=1600\\,\\mathrm{N\\cdot m}$ is approximately $95.5\\%$ of $T_{\\mathrm{fp}}$. This indicates the shaft is heavily plastic, with only a small elastic core. An analytical solution for this classic problem relates the torque to the radius of the elastic core, $r_{el}$: $T = T_{\\mathrm{fp}} - (\\pi/6)\\tau_y r_{el}^3$. Solving for $r_{el}$ yields $r_{el} \\approx 0.0113\\,\\mathrm{m}$. The twist is then $\\kappa = \\tau_y/(G r_{el}) \\approx 0.2949\\,\\mathrm{rad/m}$. The numerical method is expected to yield a result very close to this analytical value.\n\nThe numerical implementation will now follow this validated procedure.", "answer": "```python\n# The complete and runnable Python 3 code goes here.\n# Imports must adhere to the specified execution environment.\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy.optimize import bisect\n\ndef solve_for_kappa(a, R, N, G_func, tau_y_func, T_app):\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves for the twist per unit length kappa for a given shaft configuration and torque.\n    \n    Args:\n        a (float): Inner radius (m).\n        R (float): Outer radius (m).\n        N (int): Number of discretization annuli.\n        G_func (callable): Function G(r, R) for shear modulus (Pa).\n        tau_y_func (callable or float): Function tau_y(r, R) or constant for yield stress (Pa).\n        T_app (float): Applied torque (N*m).\n        \n    Returns:\n        float: The calculated twist per unit length kappa (rad/m).\n    \"\"\"\n    delta_r = (R - a) / N\n    # Midpoint radii of the N annuli\n    r = a + (np.arange(N) + 0.5) * delta_r\n\n    # Evaluate material properties at midpoints\n    G_vals = G_func(r, R)\n    \n    if callable(tau_y_func):\n        tau_y_vals = tau_y_func(r, R)\n    else:  # Handle constant yield stress\n        tau_y_vals = np.full_like(r, tau_y_func)\n\n    # Pre-calculate for efficiency\n    r_sq_delta_r = r**2 * delta_r\n\n    def torque_function(kappa):\n        \"\"\"Calculates the total torque for a given kappa.\"\"\"\n        if kappa  0:\n            return -torque_function(-kappa) # Assume symmetric response for negative kappa\n        \n        # Stress at each annulus based on elastic-perfectly plastic model\n        tau_elastic = G_vals * kappa * r\n        tau = np.minimum(tau_elastic, tau_y_vals)\n        \n        # Total torque from numerical integration\n        T_num = 2 * np.pi * np.sum(tau * r_sq_delta_r)\n        return T_num\n\n    # Feasibility check against fully plastic torque\n    T_fp = 2 * np.pi * np.sum(tau_y_vals * r_sq_delta_r)\n    if T_app > T_fp * (1 + 1e-9): # Add tolerance for numerical precision\n        # Problem statement implies feasible cases; this is for robustness.\n        return np.nan\n\n    # Objective function for the root-finder: f(kappa) = T(kappa) - T_app = 0\n    def objective_func(kappa):\n        return torque_function(kappa) - T_app\n\n    # Bisection method to find the root kappa\n    kappa_low = 0.0\n    \n    # Establish a search bracket [kappa_low, kappa_high]\n    # T(kappa) is monotonic, so is objective_func\n    kappa_high = 0.1  # Initial guess for the upper bound\n    # Ensure T(kappa_high) > T_app\n    while objective_func(kappa_high)  0:\n        if kappa_high > 1e6: # Safety break to prevent infinite loop\n            # This could happen if T_app is very close to or greater than T_fp\n            # and numerical precision issues arise.\n            return np.nan \n        kappa_high *= 2.0\n        \n    # Find the root using SciPy's bisection solver\n    try:\n        kappa_sol = bisect(objective_func, kappa_low, kappa_high, xtol=1e-12, rtol=1e-12)\n    except ValueError:\n        # This can happen if the bracket is not valid, e.g., if T_app is very close to T_fp\n        # and precision issues make objective_func(kappa_high)  0.\n        # This indicates a very high kappa.
