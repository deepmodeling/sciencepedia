A polynomial tensor field is said to be of total degree $m$ if its components are bivariate polynomials in $(x,y)$ of total degree at most $m$, with at least one component having a degree of exactly $m$.\n\nFirst, consider the link between stress and strain. If the stress field $\\sigma_{kl}$ is of polynomial degree $n$, its components are polynomials of degree at most $n$. Since the compliance tensor $S_{ijkl}$ has constant components, the strain components $\\varepsilon_{ij}$ are linear combinations of the stress components. Therefore, the strain field $\\varepsilon_{ij}$ must also be a polynomial field of degree $n$. This is because the problem requires the ability to represent any generic stress field of degree $n$, for which no fortuitous cancellation of highest-order terms can be assumed. So, we have:\n$$ \\deg(\\sigma_{ij}) = n \\implies \\deg(\\varepsilon_{ij}) = n $$\n\nNext, we establish the link between displacement and strain. Let the displacement field $u_i$ be a polynomial field of degree $p$. The strain components are obtained by taking first-order partial derivatives of the displacement components. The differentiation of a polynomial of degree $p$ with respect to a coordinate variable results in a polynomial of degree at most $p-1$. Consequently:\n$$ \\deg(u_i) = p \\implies \\deg(\\varepsilon_{ij}) \\le p-1 $$\n\nTo represent a stress field of degree $n$, we must be able to generate a strain field of degree $n$. Combining the two degree relationships, we must have:\n$$ n = \\deg(\\varepsilon_{ij}) \\le p-1 $$\nThis implies a necessary condition on the degree $p$ of the displacement field:\n$$ p \\ge n+1 $$\nThis shows that the minimal required degree for the displacement polynomial, $p_n$, must be at least $n+1$.\n\nNow, we must demonstrate that a displacement field of degree $p = n+1$ is also sufficient. This requires showing that for any kinematically admissible strain field $\\varepsilon_{ij}$ of degree $n$, a corresponding displacement field $u_i$ of degree $n+1$ exists. The displacement components are found by integrating the strain components. For example, $u_1$ and $u_2$ can be constructed as:\n$$ u_1(x,y) = \\int \\varepsilon_{11}(x,y) \\, dx + f_1(y) $$\n$$ u_2(x,y) = \\int \\varepsilon_{22}(x,y) \\, dy + f_2(x) $$\nThe functions of integration, $f_1(y)$ and $f_2(x)$, are determined by satisfying the shear strain relation, $2\\varepsilon_{12} = \\partial_y u_1 + \\partial_x u_2$. The problem statement guarantees that such a single-valued displacement field exists by positing that the strain field is kinematically admissible (i.e., it satisfies the Saint-Venant compatibility conditions).\n\nIf a strain component, say $\\varepsilon_{11}$, is a polynomial of degree $n$, its indefinite integral with respect to $x$ will be a polynomial of degree at most $n+1$. A systematic integration procedure shows that the functions $f_1(y)$ and $f_2(x)$ will also be polynomials of degree at most $n+1$. The overall displacement solution is determined up to a rigid body motion, which for small strains is a polynomial field of degree $1$. The highest degree of the displacement field is therefore $n+1$, which comes from the integration of the degree-$n$ strain field.\n\nSince a displacement field of degree $p \\ge n+1$ is necessary, and a field of degree $p = n+1$ is sufficient, the minimal required polynomial degree is exactly $p_n = n+1$.\n\nWe apply this general result to the cases specified:\n-   **Uniform stress field ($n=0$):** The stress components are constants. The minimal required displacement degree is $p_0 = 0+1 = 1$. The displacement field is linear.\n-   **Linear stress field ($n=1$):** The stress components are linear polynomials.
