This vector is $(0, Y_0, 0)$. We rotate this vector by $\\theta$ about the $X$-axis and add it back to the point on the rotation axis.\n    The rotation of vector $(0, Y_0, 0)$ is:\n    $$ \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & \\cos\\theta & -\\sin\\theta \\\\ 0 & \\sin\\theta & \\cos\\theta \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ Y_0 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ Y_0 \\cos\\theta \\\\ Y_0 \\sin\\theta \\end{pmatrix} $$\n    The new position $\\mathbf{P}=(X,Y,Z)$ is found by adding this rotated vector to the point $(X_0, 0, Z_0)$ on the rotation axis:\n    $$ X = X_0 + 0 = X_0 $$\n    $$ Y = 0 + Y_0 \\cos\\theta = Y_0 \\cos\\theta $$\n    $$ Z = Z_0 + Y_0 \\sin\\theta $$\n\n3.  **Deformed Image Coordinates and Mapping:**\n    We now find the new image coordinates $\\mathbf{p}=(x,y)$ by projecting the new 3D point $\\mathbf{P}$ onto the image plane. We first express $X,Y,Z$ in terms of the reference image coordinates $(x_0, y_0)$:\n    $$ X = \\frac{x_0 Z_0}{f} $$\n    $$ Y = \\frac{y_0 Z_0}{f} \\cos\\theta $$\n    $$ Z = Z_0 + \\frac{y_0 Z_0}{f} \\sin\\theta = Z_0 \\left( 1 + \\frac{y_0}{f} \\sin\\theta \\right) $$\n    The new image coordinates $(x,y)$ are:\n    $$ x = f \\frac{X}{Z} = f \\frac{\\frac{x_0 Z_0}{f}}{Z_0 \\left( 1 + \\frac{y_0}{f} \\sin\\theta \\right)} = \\frac{x_0}{1 + \\frac{y_0}{f} \\sin\\theta} $$\n    $$ y = f \\frac{Y}{Z} = f \\frac{\\frac{y_0 Z_0}{f} \\cos\\theta}{Z_0 \\left( 1 + \\frac{y_0}{f} \\sin\\theta \\right)} = \\frac{y_0 \\cos\\theta}{1 + \\frac{y_0}{f} \\sin\\theta} $$\n    This provides the mapping from $(x_0, y_0)$ to $(x, y)$.\n\n4.  **Strain Tensor Calculation:**\n    To find the infinitesimal strain tensor, we first compute the deformation gradient tensor $\\mathbf{F}$ at the image center $(x_0, y_0) = (0, 0)$.\n    $$ \\mathbf{F} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{\\partial x}{\\partial x_0} & \\frac{\\partial x}{\\partial y_0} \\\\ \\frac{\\partial y}{\\partial x_0} & \\frac{\\partial y}{\\partial y_0} \\end{pmatrix} $$\n    The required partial derivatives are:\n    $$ \\frac{\\partial x}{\\partial x_0} = \\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{y_0}{f} \\sin\\theta} $$\n    $$ \\frac{\\partial x}{\\partial y_0} = -\\frac{x_0 \\left( \\frac{1}{f} \\sin\\theta \\right)}{\\left( 1 + \\frac{y_0}{f} \\sin\\theta \\right)^2} $$\n    $$ \\frac{\\partial y}{\\partial x_0} = 0 $$\n    $$ \\frac{\\partial y}{\\partial y_0} = \\frac{\\cos\\theta \\left( 1 + \\frac{y_0}{f} \\sin\\theta \\right) - y_0 \\cos\\theta \\left( \\frac{1}{f} \\sin\\theta \\right)}{\\left( 1 + \\frac{y_0}{f} \\sin\\theta \\right)^2} = \\frac{\\cos\\theta}{\\left( 1 + \\frac{y_0}{f} \\sin\\theta \\right)^2} $$\n    Evaluating these at $(x_0, y_0) = (0, 0)$:\n    $$ \\frac{\\partial x}{\\partial x_0}\\bigg|_{(0,0)} = 1 \\quad , \\quad \\frac{\\partial x}{\\partial y_0}\\bigg|_{(0,0)} = 0 $$\n    $$ \\frac{\\partial y}{\\partial x_0}\\bigg|_{(0,0)} = 0 \\quad , \\quad \\frac{\\partial y}{\\partial y_0}\\bigg|_{(0,0)} = \\cos\\theta $$\n    The deformation gradient tensor at the image center is:\n    $$ \\mathbf{F}\\big|_{(0,0)} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & \\cos\\theta \\end{pmatrix} $$\n    The displacement gradient tensor $\\mathbf{J}$ is $\\mathbf{F} - \\mathbf{I}$, where $\\mathbf{I}$ is the identity matrix.\n    $$ \\mathbf{J}\\big|_{(0,0)} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & \\cos\\theta \\end{pmatrix} - \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & \\cos\\theta - 1 \\end{pmatrix} $$\n    The infinitesimal strain tensor $\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}$ is the symmetric part of $\\mathbf{J}$:\n    $$ \\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon} = \\frac{1}{2} (\\mathbf{J} + \\mathbf{J}^T) = \\frac{1}{2} \\left( \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & \\cos\\theta - 1 \\end{pmatrix} + \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & \\cos\\theta - 1 \\end{pmatrix}^T \\right) = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & \\cos\\theta - 1 \\end{pmatrix} $$\n    From this tensor, we identify the components a $2$D DIC algorithm would report at the center:\n    $$ \\varepsilon_{xx} = 0 $$\n    $$ \\varepsilon_{yy} = \\cos\\theta - 1 $$\n    $$ \\varepsilon_{xy} = 0 $$\n    This non-zero strain $\\varepsilon_{yy}$ is a fictitious strain, an artifact of projecting a $3$D motion onto a $2$D plane.\n\n5.  **Stereo DIC Justification:**\n    Stereo DIC uses two or more cameras to reconstruct the three-dimensional coordinates $(X,Y,Z)$ of the specimen surface in both its reference and deformed states. By tracking the $3$D positions of material points, it directly measures the $3$D displacement field $\\mathbf{U}(\\mathbf{P}_0) = \\mathbf{P} - \\mathbf{P}_0$.\n    The motion described in the problem is a pure rigid-body rotation. By definition, a rigid-body motion preserves the distance between any two points within the body. Therefore, it induces no physical strain.\n    An ideal stereo DIC system, by correctly reconstructing the $3$D geometry, would identify the transformation as a rigid-body motion. The calculation of strain from the reconstructed $3$D field would correctly yield a zero strain tensor everywhere on the specimen. The fictitious strains arise in $2$D DIC precisely because it cannot distinguish between true in-plane deformation and the apparent deformation caused by out-of-plane motion. Stereo DIC is designed specifically to overcome this limitation. Thus, stereo DIC would report zero strain.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 0 & \\cos\\theta - 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}}\n$$", "id": "2630444"}]}
