The language used is objective and precise, devoid of ambiguity. The constraints given are physically realistic for such a model. There are no internal contradictions, missing information, or violations of physical principles.\n\nThe verdict is that the problem is valid. We proceed with the derivation.\n\nThe traction-separation law, $\\sigma(\\delta)$, where $\\sigma$ is the normal cohesive traction and $\\delta$ is the normal opening displacement, is defined in two parts.\n\nPart 1: The initial linear elastic branch for $0 \\le \\delta \\le \\delta_p$.\nThe relationship is given by the stiffness $K_0$:\n$$ \\sigma(\\delta) = K_0 \\delta $$\nThis linear relationship holds up to the peak traction $\\sigma_c$, which is reached at the opening displacement $\\delta_p$.

However, there is a critical imprecision in the statement. The Dugdale condition is physically motivated by the requirement that the stress field remains bounded at the crack tip. In the model, the physical crack of length $2a$ is replaced by a fictitious, longer crack of length $2c$, with cohesive forces acting on the newly created faces in the regions $a  |x|  c$. The stress singularity is thus moved from the physical crack tip $x=a$ to the fictitious crack tip $x=c$. The Dugdale condition is the requirement that the stress singularity at this fictitious tip is nullified, which is mathematically expressed as the net Mode I stress intensity factor (SIF) at the fictitious tip being zero, i.e., $K_{I}^{\\text{net}}(x=c)=0$.\n\nThe condition stated in the problem, $K_{I}^{\\text{net}}(x=a)=0$, is physically incorrect or at best trivially satisfied. The point $x=a$ is not a crack tip in the model's formulation; it is an interior point of the fictitious crack of length $2c$. The stress intensity factor is, by definition, a measure of the singularity at a crack tip. At any other point, it is not defined or is zero. Therefore, imposing $K_{I}^{\\text{net}}(x=a)=0$ provides no information for determining the unknown length $c$.\n\nI will proceed by correcting this flaw and solving the problem using the physically correct Dugdale condition, $K_{I}^{\\text{net}}(x=c)=0$, which is the standard procedure and clearly the intended problem.\n\nThe problem can be solved using the principle of superposition. We consider a fictitious crack of total length $2c$ centered on the $x$-axis. The original problem is equivalent to this crack being subjected to a specific pressure distribution $p(x)$ on its faces, such that the boundary conditions of the original problem are recovered.\n\n1.  A remote tensile stress $\\sigma_{\\infty}$ is equivalent to applying a uniform opening pressure $p_{1}(x) = \\sigma_{\\infty}$ on the crack faces $|x|  c$.\n2.

The problem is scientifically grounded in solid mechanics, well-posed, objective, and contains sufficient information for a rigorous analysis. The problem is deemed valid.\n\n**Derivation of the Global Response and Stability Condition**\n\nThe system is governed by two fundamental relations:\n1.  Force equilibrium across the interface: $F = A\\,T(\\delta)$\n2.  Kinematic compatibility for the series system: $\\Delta = \\delta + \\frac{FL}{EA}$\n\nBy substituting the force-equilibrium relation into the kinematic compatibility equation, we express the total displacement $\\Delta$ as a function of the interface opening $\\delta$:\n$$ \\Delta(\\delta) = \\delta + \\frac{A\\,T(\\delta)L}{EA} = \\delta + \\frac{L}{E}T(\\delta) $$\nThe global force $F$ is also a function of $\\delta$: $F(\\delta) = A\\,T(\\delta)$.\nThe global force-displacement response $F(\\Delta)$ is thus described parametrically in terms of $\\delta$. To analyze its shape and stability, we examine its derivative, $\\frac{dF}{d\\Delta}$. Using the chain rule, this is given by:\n$$ \\frac{dF}{d\\Delta} = \\frac{dF/d\\delta}{d\\Delta/d\\delta} $$\nThe required derivatives with respect to $\\delta$ are:\n$$ \\frac{dF}{d\\delta} = A\\,\\frac{dT}{d\\delta} = A\\,T'(\\delta) $$\n$$ \\frac{d\\Delta}{d\\delta} = 1 + \\frac{L}{E}\\frac{dT}{d\\delta} = 1 + \\frac{L}{E}T'(\\delta) $$\nThus, the slope of the global force-displacement curve is:\n$$ \\frac{dF}{d\\Delta} = \\frac{A\\,T'(\\delta)}{1 + \\frac{L}{E}T'(\\delta)} $$\nA snap-back instability under displacement control occurs when the total displacement $\\Delta$ decreases as the internal degree of freedom $\\delta$ continues to increase. Mathematically, this corresponds to the condition $\\frac{d\\Delta}{d\\delta}  0$.\n$$ \\frac{d\\Delta}{d\\delta}  0 \\implies 1 + \\frac{L}{E}T'(\\delta)  0 $$\nOn a softening branch of the cohesive law, $T'(\\delta)  0$. The condition for snap-back becomes:\n$$ \\frac{L}{E}T'(\\delta)  -1 \\implies T'(\\delta)  -\\frac{E}{L} $$\nSince $T'(\\delta)$ is negative, this is equivalent to:\n$$ |T'(\\delta)|  \\frac{E}{L} $$\nWe can express this condition in terms of stiffness. The tangent stiffness of the cohesive interface is $k_c(\\delta) = A\\,T'(\\delta)$, which is negative during softening. The stiffness of the elastic bar is $k_e = \\frac{EA}{L}$. The snap-back condition is $|T'(\\delta)|  \\frac{E}{L}$. Multiplying by the area $A$ (which is a positive constant), we get:\n$$ |A\\,T'(\\delta)|  \\frac{EA}{L} \\implies |k_c(\\delta)|  k_e $$\nSnap-back occurs if, at any point on the softening branch, the magnitude of the negative tangent stiffness of the cohesive interface exceeds the stiffness of the surrounding elastic structure.\n\nWith this framework, we evaluate each statement.\n\n**Option-by-Option Analysis**\n\n**A. Under hard displacement control (effectively infinite machine stiffness), a necessary and sufficient condition for snap-back in $F(\\Delta)$ is that at some opening $\\delta$ on the softening branch the magnitude of the cohesive tangent stiffness exceeds the bar stiffness, i.e., $\\lvert A\\,T'(\\delta)\\rvert  E A / L$; equivalently, the cohesive softening slope is steeper in magnitude than the elastic stiffness of the surrounding structure.**\n\nThis statement claims the condition for snap-back is $\\lvert A\\,T'(\\delta)\\rvert  E A / L$. My derivation above shows this is precisely the condition for $\\frac{d\\Delta}{d\\delta}  0$, which defines snap-back. The phrase \"hard displacement control\" correctly implies that $\\Delta$ is the controlled parameter. The interpretation of the cohesive tangent stiffness as $A\\,T'(\\delta)$ and the bar stiffness as $EA/L$ is correct. The statement is a necessary and sufficient condition.\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\n**B. For a Dugdale cohesive law with a perfectly plastic plateau $T(\\delta)=\\sigma_{c}$ for $0\\delta\\delta_{c}$, there is no snap-back prior to reaching $\\delta=\\delta_{c}$; under displacement control the global response exhibits a force plateau $F(\\Delta)=A\\,\\sigma_{c}$ up to $\\delta=\\delta_{c}$, after which $F$ drops as the interface fully decoheres.**\n\nFor the Dugdale model, in the range $0  \\delta  \\delta_c$, we have $T(\\delta) = \\sigma_c$, a constant. Therefore, the derivative $T'(\\delta) = 0$. The condition for snap-back, $|T'(\\delta)|  E/L$, becomes $0  E/L$, which is false. Thus, there is no snap-back in this region. The force is $F = A\\,\\sigma_c$, which is constant. The slope of the global response is $\\frac{dF}{d\\Delta} = \\frac{A \\cdot 0}{1 + (L/E) \\cdot 0} = 0$. This confirms a force plateau. At $\\delta = \\delta_c$, the interface fails and traction drops to $0$. This causes the force $F$ in the bar to drop to $0$. The statement's description of the behavior is entirely accurate.\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\n**C. Under load control, the onset of cohesive softening with $T'(\\delta)0$ causes a loss of stability at a limit point of the global response, independent of $E A/L$; thus the descending branch cannot be followed in load control in this series system.**\n\nUnder load control, the force $F$ is the independent variable. Instability occurs at a limit point, where the system can no longer sustain an increase in load. This happens at the maximum achievable force. The force is $F(\\delta) = A\\,T(\\delta)$. The maximum force occurs when $\\frac{dF}{d\\delta} = A\\,T'(\\delta) = 0$. This condition corresponds to the peak of the cohesive traction law, which is precisely the onset of softening. The value of $\\delta$ where this occurs depends only on the function $T(\\delta)$, not on the bar's properties $E, A, L$. Therefore, the loss of stability is indeed independent of $EA/L$. In a load-controlled test, once the peak force is reached, any further deformation occurs at a lower force capacity, leading to uncontrolled, dynamic failure. It is not possible to stably trace the descending (softening) branch.\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\n**D. Cohesive laws with a mild initial softening slope (small negative $T'(\\delta)$ near the onset of softening), such as an exponential softening with gentle initial tangent, can avoid snap-back provided the bar is sufficiently stiff so that $\\lvert A\\,T'(\\delta)\\rvert  E A / L$ over the range of $\\delta$ traversed; the detailed shape of $T(\\delta)$ matters through how steep the softening becomes relative to the elastic stiffness.**\n\nThis statement describes the condition for stable softening (avoiding snap-back), which from our derivation is $|A\\,T'(\\delta)|  EA/L$. A \"mild\" softening slope means $|T'(\\delta)|$ is small. A \"stiff\" bar means $EA/L$ is large. Both factors make the inequality more likely to be satisfied, thus preventing snap-back. The statement correctly identifies that the stability depends on the competition between the rate of cohesive softening and the bar stiffness. The description is fully consistent with the derived stability condition.\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\n**E. Increasing the compliance of the surrounding structure (reducing $E A/L$) suppresses snap-back under displacement control by making the global force–displacement curve more monotonic in $\\Delta$.**\n\nThe compliance of the bar is $L/(EA)$, the inverse of its stiffness $k_e = EA/L$. Increasing compliance means reducing the stiffness $EA/L$. The condition for snap-back is $|A\\,T'(\\delta)|  EA/L$. If we reduce $EA/L$, the right side of the inequality becomes smaller, making it *easier* to satisfy the condition. Therefore, increasing compliance *promotes* snap-back, rather than suppressing it. A more compliant structure is more prone to snap-back instability. The statement claims the opposite.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**F. If $T(\\delta)$ is strictly decreasing for all $\\delta0$ (no initial hardening), then snap-back cannot occur under displacement control because $F$ is a monotonic function of $\\delta$.**\n\nThe premise is $T'(\\delta)  0$ for all $\\delta  0$. The conclusion is that snap-back cannot occur. The reason given is that $F(\\delta) = A\\,T(\\delta)$ is monotonic. While it is true that $F(\\delta)$ is monotonic decreasing, this is not the criterion for snap-back. The criterion is whether $T'(\\delta)$ is sufficiently negative to satisfy $|T'(\\delta)|  E/L$. A cohesive law can be strictly decreasing but have a very steep initial slope. For example, $T(\\delta) = T_{max} \\exp(-\\alpha \\delta)$ has $T'(\\delta) = -\\alpha T_{max} \\exp(-\\alpha \\delta)$, which is always negative. At $\\delta=0$, the slope magnitude is $|T'(0)| = \\alpha T_{max}$. If $\\alpha T_{max}  E/L$, snap-back will occur from the very beginning of the process. The reasoning provided in the statement is flawed, and the conclusion is false.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{ABCD}$$", "id": "2632178"}]}
