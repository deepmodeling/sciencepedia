It is based on the standard mathematical framework of quantitative texture analysis in solid mechanics and materials science. All definitions and conditions are formally provided, enabling a rigorous derivation. The problem is therefore valid.\n\nThe problem consists of two parts. I shall address each in sequence.\n\nPart 1: The nature of the Orientation Distribution Function (ODF) for a random texture.\n\nAn ODF, $f(g)$, is the probability density function for crystal orientations $g \\in SO(3)$ with respect to the normalized Haar measure $\\mu$. The probability of finding an orientation within a measurable subset $A \\subset SO(3)$ is given by the integral\n$$ \\mathbb{P}(A) = \\int_{A} f(g)\\,\\mathrm{d}\\mu(g) $$\nThe problem defines a random texture as one for which this probability is equal to the Haar measure of the set, $\\mu(A)$.\n$$ \\mathbb{P}(A) = \\mu(A) $$\nThe Haar measure of a set $A$ can also be written in integral form as\n$$ \\mu(A) = \\int_{A} 1 \\cdot \\mathrm{d}\\mu(g) $$\nBy equating the two expressions for $\\mathbb{P}(A)$, we have\n$$ \\int_{A} f(g)\\,\\mathrm{d}\\mu(g) = \\int_{A} 1 \\cdot \\mathrm{d}\\mu(g) $$\nThis equality must hold for any measurable set $A \\subset SO(3)$. By the fundamental properties of measures (specifically, the uniqueness of the Radon-Nikodym derivative), if two absolutely continuous measures have the same value on all measurable sets, their densities with respect to the base measure must be equal almost everywhere. In this case, the density of the probability measure $\\mathbb{P}$ is $f(g)$, and the density of the measure $\\mu$ with respect to itself is the constant function $1$. Therefore, we must have\n$$ f(g) = 1 $$\nfor $\\mu$-almost every $g \\in SO(3)$. The total probability is conserved, as $\\int_{SO(3)} 1 \\cdot \\mathrm{d}\\mu(g) = \\mu(SO(3)) = 1$. This completes the first part of the proof.\n\nNext, we consider the effect of crystal symmetry. The crystal lattice is invariant under a finite set of rotations, which form a point group $S \\subset SO(3)$ of order $|S|$. This means orientations $g$ and $gs$ for any $s \\in S$ are physically indistinguishable. Consequently, the ODF must be invariant under the right action of the crystal symmetry group, consistent with the definition in the main text:\n$$ f(g s) = f(g) \\quad \\forall s \\in S, \\forall g \\in SO(3) $$\nThe set of all orientations is partitioned into equivalence classes of the form $\\{gs \\mid s \\in S\\}$. A fundamental zone (FZ) is a subset of $SO(3)$ that contains exactly one representative from each equivalence class (ignoring boundaries). Due to the invariance of the Haar measure, the measure of the fundamental zone is $\\mu(\\text{FZ}) = \\mu(SO(3)) / |S| = 1/|S|$.\n\nThe normalization condition for the symmetric ODF $f(g)$ can be related to an integral over the FZ. The integral over the whole group can be expressed as an integral over the FZ, accounting for the $|S|$ equivalent orientations for each point in the FZ:\n$$ 1 = \\int_{SO(3)} f(g)\\,\\mathrm{d}\\mu(g) = |S| \\int_{\\text{FZ}} f(g)\\,\\mathrm{d}\\mu(g) $$\nSo, $\\int_{\\text{FZ}} f(g)\\,\\mathrm{d}\\mu(g) = 1/|S|$. For a random texture, where $f(g)=1$ on $SO(3)$, its value is also $1$ within the FZ. The integral is $\\int_{\\text{FZ}} 1 \\cdot \\mathrm{d}\\mu(g) = \\mu(\\text{FZ}) = 1/|S|$, which is consistent.\n\nIn practice, it is common to define a \"symmetry-reduced\" ODF, let us call it $f_{\\text{FZ}}(g)$, which is defined only on the FZ and is normalized such that $\\int_{\\text{FZ}} f_{\\text{FZ}}(g)\\,\\mathrm{d}\\mu(g) = 1$. Comparing this with the previous integral relation, we see the relationship must be $f_{\\text{FZ}}(g) = |S|f(g)$ for $g \\in \\text{FZ}$. For a random texture where $f(g)=1$, the symmetry-reduced constant value is $f_{\\text{FZ}}(g) = |S|$. This value is often expressed in \"multiples of random distribution\" (MRD), where a value of $1$ MRD corresponds to $f(g)=1$.\n\nTo extend this representation back to $SO(3)$, we are given a function $f_{\\text{FZ}}$ on the FZ and must define $f(g)$ for all $g \\in SO(3)$. Any $g$ can be written as $g = g_0 s$ for some $s \\in S$ and $g_0 \\in \\text{FZ}$. The extension is defined by $f(g) = \\frac{1}{|S|} f_{\\text{FZ}}(g_0)$. If we start with the constant value $f_{\\text{FZ}}(g) = |S|$ in the FZ, this construction gives $f(g) = \\frac{1}{|S|} |S| = 1$ for all $g \\in SO(3)$, which is the correct ODF for a random texture.\n\nPart 2: Computation of the pole figure for a random texture.\n\nThe pole figure density $p(\\mathbf{u})$ is defined as:\n$$ p(\\mathbf{u}) = \\int_{SO(3)} f(g)\\,\\delta(\\mathbf{u}-g\\,\\mathbf{h})\\,\\mathrm{d}\\mu(g) $$\nFor a random texture, we substitute $f(g) = 1$:\n$$ p(\\mathbf{u}) = \\int_{SO(3)} \\delta(\\mathbf{u}-g\\,\\mathbf{h})\\,\\mathrm{d}\\mu(g) $$\nFirst, we demonstrate that $p(\\mathbf{u})$ must be a constant function on the sphere $\\mathbb{S}^2$. Let $k \\in SO(3)$ be an arbitrary rotation. We evaluate $p(k\\mathbf{u})$:\n$$ p(k\\mathbf{u}) = \\int_{SO(3)} \\delta(k\\mathbf{u}-g\\,\\mathbf{h})\\,\\mathrm{d}\\mu(g) $$\nThe delta function has the property $\\delta(k\\mathbf{v}) = \\delta(\\mathbf{v})$ for any rotation $k$ since it is an isometry (Jacobian is $1$). A more formal way is to say $\\delta(k\\mathbf{u}-g\\mathbf{h}) = \\delta(k(\\mathbf{u}-k^{-1}g\\mathbf{h}))$ and use the property of delta distributions under diffeomorphisms. So,\n$$ p(k\\mathbf{u}) = \\int_{SO(3)} \\delta(\\mathbf{u}-k^{-1}g\\,\\mathbf{h})\\,\\mathrm{d}\\mu(g) $$\nWe perform a change of integration variable $g' = k^{-1}g$. This implies $g = kg'$. The Haar measure $\\mu$ is left-invariant, so $\\mathrm{d}\\mu(g) = \\mathrm{d}\\mu(kg') = \\mathrm{d}\\mu(g')$. The integration is over the entire group, so the domain is unchanged. The integral becomes:\n$$ p(k\\mathbf{u}) = \\int_{SO(3)} \\delta(\\mathbf{u}-g'\\mathbf{h})\\,\\mathrm{d}\\mu(g') $$\nThe right-hand side is precisely the definition of $p(\\mathbf{u})$. Thus, we have shown that $p(k\\mathbf{u}) = p(\\mathbf{u})$ for any rotation $k \\in SO(3)$ and any $\\mathbf{u} \\in \\mathbb{S}^2$. Since $SO(3)$ acts transitively on $\\mathbb{S}^2$, this implies $p(\\mathbf{u})$ must be constant for all $\\mathbf{u} \\in \\mathbb{S}^2$. Let us denote this constant value by $C$, so $p(\\mathbf{u}) = C$.\n\nTo find the value of $C$, we integrate $p(\\mathbf{u})$ over the entire sphere $\\mathbb{S}^2$. The pole figure is a probability distribution, so its integral must be $1$. We verify this from the definitions:\n$$ \\int_{\\mathbb{S}^2} p(\\mathbf{u})\\,\\mathrm{d}\\sigma(\\mathbf{u}) = \\int_{\\mathbb{S}^2} \\left[ \\int_{SO(3)} f(g)\\,\\delta(\\mathbf{u}-g\\,\\mathbf{h})\\,\\mathrm{d}\\mu(g) \\right] \\mathrm{d}\\sigma(\\mathbf{u}) $$\nSince the integrand is non-negative, we can apply Fubini's theorem to switch the order of integration:\n$$ = \\int_{SO(3)} f(g) \\left[ \\int_{\\mathbb{S}^2} \\delta(\\mathbf{u}-g\\,\\mathbf{h})\\,\\mathrm{d}\\sigma(\\mathbf{u}) \\right] \\mathrm{d}\\mu(g) $$\nThe inner integral is over $\\mathbb{S}^2$. For any fixed $g$, the vector $\\mathbf{v} = g\\mathbf{h}$ is a point on the sphere. The problem states that $\\int_{\\mathbb{S}^2} \\delta(\\mathbf{u}-\\mathbf{v})\\,\\mathrm{d}\\sigma(\\mathbf{u}) = 1$ for any fixed $\\mathbf{v}$. Thus, the inner integral evaluates to $1$ for all $g$.\nThe expression simplifies to:\n$$ = \\int_{SO(3)} f(g) \\cdot 1 \\,\\mathrm{d}\\mu(g) = \\int_{SO(3)} f(g)\\,\\mathrm{d}\\mu(g) $$\nThis is the normalization condition for the ODF, which is equal to $1$.\nSo, we have established that $\\int_{\\mathbb{S}^2} p(\\mathbf{u})\\,\\mathrm{d}\\sigma(\\mathbf{u}) = 1$.\nSubstituting $p(\\mathbf{u}) = C$, we obtain:\n$$ \\int_{\\mathbb{S}^2} C\\,\\mathrm{d}\\sigma(\\mathbf{u}) = C \\int_{\\mathbb{S}^2} \\mathrm{d}\\sigma(\\mathbf{u}) = 1 $$\nThe integral $\\int_{\\mathbb{S}^2} \\mathrm{d}\\sigma(\\mathbf{u})$ is the total surface area of the unit sphere, which is $4\\pi$.\n$$ C \\cdot (4\\pi) = 1 $$\nSolving for $C$ gives:\n$$ C = \\frac{1}{4\\pi} $$\nThe measure $\\sigma$ is the surface-area measure on the unit sphere, so its integral $\\int_{\\mathbb{S}^2} \\mathrm{d}\\sigma(\\mathbf{u})$ has units of solid angle (steradians, sr). Thus, $p(\\mathbf{u})$ has units of $\\mathrm{sr}^{-1}$. The constant value of the pole figure density for a random texture is $\\frac{1}{4\\pi} \\, \\mathrm{sr}^{-1}$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{1}{4\\pi}}$$", "id": "2693607"}, {"introduction": "The primary reason for studying texture is its profound influence on a material's anisotropic properties.

There are no scientific or factual unsoundness, no contradictions, no ambiguities, and no reliance on subjective claims. The problem is a non-trivial, standard exercise in computational materials science.\n\nStep 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. I will proceed with a complete solution.\n\nSolution\n\nThe task is to derive a computable formulation for the orientation-dependent Taylor factor $M(\\mathbf{R})$ and its polycrystal average $\\overline{M}$, and then to provide a numerical value for $\\overline{M}$ for an FCC polycrystal under uniaxial tension.\n\nThe Taylor factor $M(\\mathbf{R})$ is defined via a minimization problem, which is recognized as the primal form of a linear program. A more computationally convenient formulation is obtained by considering the dual problem, which connects to the principle of maximum plastic work.\n\nThe plastic work rate per unit volume is given by $W = \\mathbf{S} : \\mathbf{D}^p$, where $\\mathbf{S}$ is the deviatoric stress tensor. Under the Taylor hypothesis, $\\mathbf{D}^p = \\mathbf{D}$. The work rate can also be expressed as the sum of work dissipated on all slip systems: $W = \\sum_{s=1}^{12} \\tau_s \\dot{\\gamma}_s$, where $\\tau_s = \\mathbf{S} : \\mathbf{m}_s(\\mathbf{R})$ is the resolved shear stress on system $s$. For rate-independent plasticity, slip on system $s$ is active ($\\dot{\\gamma}_s \\neq 0$) only if the resolved shear stress reaches a critical value, $\\tau_c$. Thus, $\\tau_s = \\tau_c \\operatorname{sgn}(\\dot{\\gamma}_s)$ for active systems. Substituting this into the work expression yields $W = \\sum_{s=1}^{12} \\tau_c \\operatorname{sgn}(\\dot{\\gamma}_s) \\dot{\\gamma}_s = \\tau_c \\sum_{s=1}^{12} |\\dot{\\gamma}_s|$.\n\nEquating the two expressions for the work rate, we have $\\mathbf{S} : \\mathbf{D} = \\tau_c \\sum_{s=1}^{12} |\\dot{\\gamma}_s|$. We can rearrange this to find an expression for the total shear: $\\sum_{s=1}^{12} |\\dot{\\gamma}_s| = \\frac{\\mathbf{S} : \\mathbf{D}}{\\tau_c}$.\n\nSubstituting this into the definition of $M(\\mathbf{R})$:\n$$\nM(\\mathbf{R}) = \\frac{1}{\\dot{\\varepsilon}_{\\mathrm{eq}}} \\min_{\\{\\dot{\\gamma}_s\\}} \\left\\{ \\frac{\\mathbf{S} : \\mathbf{D}}{\\tau_c} \\right\\} \\quad \\text{s.t.} \\quad \\sum_{s=1}^{12} \\dot{\\gamma}_s \\mathbf{m}_s(\\mathbf{R}) = \\mathbf{D}.\n$$\nThe stress $\\mathbf{S}$ must satisfy the yield criterion for all slip systems. The Schmid law states that for any system $s$ (active or inactive), the magnitude of the resolved shear stress cannot exceed the critical value: $|\\tau_s| = |\\mathbf{S} : \\mathbf{m}_s(\\mathbf{R})| \\le \\tau_c$.\n\nLet us define a normalized deviatoric stress $\\mathbf{\\Sigma} = \\mathbf{S} / \\tau_c$ and a normalized strain-rate tensor $\\mathbf{U} = \\mathbf{D} / \\dot{\\varepsilon}_{\\mathrm{eq}}$. The Taylor factor becomes $M(\\mathbf{R}) = \\mathbf{\\Sigma} : \\mathbf{U}$. The yield condition becomes $|\\mathbf{\\Sigma} : \\mathbf{m}_s(\\mathbf{R})| \\le 1$ for all $s = 1, \\dots, 12$.\n\nAccording to the principle of maximum plastic work (as formulated by Bishop and Hill), for a given strain rate $\\mathbf{D}$, the operative stress state is the one that maximizes the plastic work rate, from all stress states that satisfy the yield criterion. This establishes the dual problem: $M(\\mathbf{R})$ is the maximum value of $\\mathbf{\\Sigma} : \\mathbf{U}$ over all allowable stress states $\\mathbf{\\Sigma}$.\n\nThus, the computable formulation for $M(\\mathbf{R})$ is given by the following linear program:\n$$\nM(\\mathbf{R}) = \\max_{\\mathbf{\\Sigma}} \\{ \\mathbf{\\Sigma} : \\mathbf{U} \\} \\quad \\text{subject to:} \\quad\n\\begin{cases}\n\\mathrm{tr}(\\mathbf{\\Sigma}) = 0 \\\\\n|\\mathbf{\\Sigma} : \\mathbf{m}_s(\\mathbf{R})| \\le 1 \\quad \\text{for } s = 1, \\dots, 12.\n\\end{cases}\n$$\nThe variables of this optimization problem are the $5$ independent components of the deviatoric stress tensor $\\mathbf{\\Sigma}$. The objective function is linear in these components, and there are $2 \\times 12 = 24$ linear inequality constraints.\n\nFor the given uniaxial tensile loading, $\\dot{\\varepsilon}_{\\mathrm{eq}} = \\dot{\\varepsilon}$, so the normalized strain-rate tensor is:\n$$\n\\mathbf{U} = \\frac{\\mathbf{D}}{\\dot{\\varepsilon}_{\\mathrm{eq}}} = \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2  0  0 \\\\ 0  -1/2  0 \\\\ 0  0  1 \\end{pmatrix}.\n$$\n\nThe polycrystal Taylor factor $\\overline{M}$ is the statistical average of $M(\\mathbf{R})$ over all orientations, assuming a random texture. The formulation is the integral:\n$$\n\\overline{M} = \\int_{\\mathrm{SO}(3)} M(\\mathbf{R})\\, d\\mu(\\mathbf{R}).\n$$\nTo evaluate this integral, the orientation space $\\mathrm{SO}(3)$ is parameterized, for example, by Euler angles $(\\phi_1, \\Phi, \\phi_2)$. The invariant Haar measure is $d\\mu(\\mathbf{R}) = \\frac{1}{8\\pi^2} \\sin(\\Phi) d\\phi_1 d\\Phi d\\phi_2$. The integral becomes:\n$$\n\\overline{M} = \\frac{1}{8\\pi^2} \\int_0^{2\\pi} \\int_0^\\pi \\int_0^{2\\pi} M(\\phi_1, \\Phi, \\phi_2) \\sin(\\Phi) \\,d\\phi_1 \\,d\\Phi \\,d\\phi_2.\n$$\n\nThis integral is computed numerically. The procedure is as follows:\n$1$. The orientation space is discretized into a set of $N$ orientations $\\{\\mathbf{R}_k\\}_{k=1}^N$, with corresponding volume fractions or weights $w_k$.\n$2$. For each orientation $\\mathbf{R}_k$, the $12$ Schmid tensors $\\mathbf{m}_s(\\mathbf{R}_k)$ are computed. The FCC slip systems $\\{\\mathbf{d}_s, \\mathbf{n}_s\\}_{s=1}^{12}$ are standard crystallographic vectors.\n$3$. For each $\\mathbf{R}_k$, the linear programming problem for $M(\\mathbf{R}_k)$ is solved to find the orientation-dependent Taylor factor.\n$4$.
