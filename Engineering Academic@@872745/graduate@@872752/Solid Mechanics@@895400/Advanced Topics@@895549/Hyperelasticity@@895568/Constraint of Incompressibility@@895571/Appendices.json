The problem is therefore deemed valid. We shall proceed with the derivation.\n\nThe fundamental relationship between the principal Cauchy stresses $\\sigma_i$ and the strain-energy density function $W$ for an isotropic, incompressible hyperelastic material is a cornerstone of constitutive theory. For such a material, the stress tensor is determined only up to an arbitrary hydrostatic pressure, which we denote by $p$. This indeterminate pressure arises as a Lagrange multiplier to enforce the kinematic constraint of incompressibility.\n\nThe relationship for the principal Cauchy stresses $\\sigma_i$ in terms of the principal stretches $\\lambda_i$ and the strain-energy density $W(\\lambda_1, \\lambda_2, \\lambda_3)$ is given by:\n$$\n\\sigma_i = \\lambda_i \\frac{\\partial W}{\\partial \\lambda_i} - p\n$$\nfor $i \\in \\{1, 2, 3\\}$.

Consequently, the total principal stretches $\\lambda_i$ are identical to the isochoric principal stretches $\\bar{\\lambda}_i$.
