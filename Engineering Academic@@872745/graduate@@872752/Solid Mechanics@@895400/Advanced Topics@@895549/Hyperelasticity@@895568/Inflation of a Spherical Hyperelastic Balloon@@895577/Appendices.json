The balloon is modeled as a thin membrane, implying a state of plane stress can be assumed. Due to spherical symmetry, the deformation is characterized by an equi-biaxial stretch $\\lambda$ in the two tangential directions (meridional and circumferential). Let the principal stretches be $\\lambda_1, \\lambda_2, \\lambda_3$. We have $\\lambda_1 = \\lambda_2 = \\lambda$. The material is incompressible, so the determinant of the deformation gradient tensor $F$ must be unity. In terms of principal stretches, this is $J = \\det(F) = \\lambda_1 \\lambda_2 \\lambda_3 = 1$. Substituting the tangential stretches, we find $\\lambda^2 \\lambda_3 = 1$, which gives the stretch in the thickness direction as $\\lambda_3 = \\lambda^{-2}$.\n\nThe deformed radius $r$ and thickness $h$ are related to their undeformed counterparts $R_0$ and $H$ by these stretches:\n$$r = \\lambda R_0$$\n$$h = \\lambda_3 H = \\lambda^{-2} H$$\n\nNext, we establish the stress state using the given neo-Hookean strain-energy function, $W = \\frac{\\mu}{2}(I_1 - 3)$. The first invariant of the left Cauchy-Green tensor $B = FF^T$ is $I_1 = \\text{tr}(B) = \\lambda_1^2 + \\lambda_2^2 + \\lambda_3^2$. For our deformation, this becomes:\n$$I_1 = \\lambda^2 + \\lambda^2 + (\\lambda^{-2})^2 = 2\\lambda^2 + \\lambda^{-4}$$\nThe Cauchy stress tensor $\\sigma$ for an incompressible hyperelastic material is given by $\\sigma = -p \\mathbf{I} + 2\\frac{\\partial W}{\\partial I_1}B$, where $p$ is a hydrostatic pressure that enforces the incompressibility constraint and $\\mathbf{I}$ is the identity tensor. For the neo-Hookean model, $\\frac{\\partial W}{\\partial I_1} = \\frac{\\mu}{2}$. Thus, the stress tensor is $\\sigma = -p \\mathbf{I} + \\mu B$. In the principal directions, the stresses are:\n$$\\sigma_1 = -p + \\mu \\lambda_1^2 = -p + \\mu \\lambda^2$$\n$$\\sigma_2 = -p + \\mu \\lambda_2^2 = -p + \\mu \\lambda^2$$\n$$\\sigma_3 = -p + \\mu \\lambda_3^2 = -p + \\mu \\lambda^{-4}$$\nThe tangential stresses $\\sigma_1$ and $\\sigma_2$ are equal, let us denote this by $\\sigma_t$. The membrane assumption implies that the stress normal to the surface is zero, i.e., $\\sigma_3=0$. This is the plane stress condition. Setting $\\sigma_3=0$ allows us to find the unknown pressure $p$:\n$$0 = -p + \\mu \\lambda^{-4} \\implies p = \\mu \\lambda^{-4}$$\nSubstituting this expression for $p$ back into the equation for the tangential stress $\\sigma_t$:\n$$\\sigma_t = -\\mu \\lambda^{-4} + \\mu \\lambda^2 = \\mu(\\lambda^2 - \\lambda^{-4})$$\nThe relationship between the internal pressure $P$ and the tangential stress in a thin spherical membrane is given by the equilibrium equation (or Laplace's law for a membrane):\n$$P = \\frac{2 \\sigma_t h}{r}$$\nSubstituting the expressions for $\\sigma_t$, $h$, and $r$ in terms of $\\lambda$:\n$$P(\\lambda) = \\frac{2 \\left[ \\mu(\\lambda^2 - \\lambda^{-4}) \\right] \\left[ H \\lambda^{-2} \\right]}{ \\lambda R_0 } = \\frac{2 \\mu H}{R_0} \\frac{(\\lambda^2 - \\lambda^{-4})\\lambda^{-2}}{\\lambda}$$\nSimplifying the expression yields the required pressure-stretch relation:\n$$P(\\lambda) = \\frac{2 \\mu H}{R_0} \\frac{1 - \\lambda^{-6}}{\\lambda} = \\frac{2 \\mu H}{R_0} (\\lambda^{-1} - \\lambda^{-7})$$\n\nSecond, we compute the initial tangent modulus, which is the derivative of $P$ with respect to $\\lambda$, evaluated at the undeformed state $\\lambda=1$. We differentiate $P(\\lambda)$:\n$$\\frac{dP}{d\\lambda} = \\frac{d}{d\\lambda} \\left[ \\frac{2 \\mu H}{R_0} (\\lambda^{-1} - \\lambda^{-7}) \\right] = \\frac{2 \\mu H}{R_0} \\left( -1 \\cdot \\lambda^{-2} - (-7) \\cdot \\lambda^{-8} \\right)$$\n$$\\frac{dP}{d\\lambda} = \\frac{2 \\mu H}{R_0} (7\\lambda^{-8} - \\lambda^{-2})$$\nEvaluating this derivative at $\\lambda=1$:\n$$\\left.\\frac{dP}{d\\lambda}\\right|_{\\lambda=1} = \\frac{2 \\mu H}{R_0} (7(1)^{-8} - (1)^{-2}) = \\frac{2 \\mu H}{R_0} (7 - 1) = \\frac{12 \\mu H}{R_0}$$\n\nThird, we verify this result using linear membrane theory for an incompressible solid. In small-strain linear elasticity, for an isotropic material, Young's modulus $E$ and shear modulus $\\mu$ (often denoted $G$) are related by $E=2\\mu(1+\\nu)$, where $\\nu$ is Poisson's ratio. For an incompressible material, $\\nu=0.5$, which gives $E = 2\\mu(1+0.5) = 3\\mu$.\nUnder a state of plane stress ($\\sigma_z=0$) with equi-biaxial tension ($\\sigma_x = \\sigma_y = \\sigma_t$), the linear elastic stress-strain relations are:\n$$\\epsilon_t = \\epsilon_x = \\frac{1}{E}(\\sigma_x - \\nu \\sigma_y) = \\frac{\\sigma_t}{E}(1-\\nu)$$\nFor $\\nu=0.5$, the tangential strain is $\\epsilon_t = \\frac{\\sigma_t}{2E}$. Substituting $E=3\\mu$, we find $\\epsilon_t = \\frac{\\sigma_t}{6\\mu}$. This gives the stress-strain relation $\\sigma_t = 6\\mu \\epsilon_t$.\nThe engineering strain for small deformations is $\\epsilon_t = \\lambda - 1$. Therefore, $\\sigma_t = 6\\mu(\\lambda-1)$.\nThe linearized force balance equation uses the undeformed geometry:\n$$P(2\\pi R_0 H) = \\sigma_t(2\\pi R_0^2)$$\nNo, this is incorrect. The pressure acts on the area $\\pi R_0^2$ and is balanced by the stress resultant integrated over the circumference $2\\pi R_0$. The correct equilibrium equation is $P \\pi R_0^2 = \\sigma_t (2\\pi R_0 H)$, which simplifies to:\n$$P = \\frac{2\\sigma_t H}{R_0}$$\nSubstituting the linear stress-strain relation into this pressure equation gives the linearized pressure-stretch relation:\n$$P(\\lambda) = \\frac{2H}{R_0} \\left[ 6\\mu(\\lambda-1) \\right] = \\frac{12 \\mu H}{R_0}(\\lambda-1)$$\nThe slope of this linear function is constant:\n$$\\frac{dP}{d\\lambda} = \\frac{12 \\mu H}{R_0}$$\nThis result from linear theory is identical to the initial tangent modulus derived from the full non-linear hyperelastic theory at $\\lambda=1$.

This allows determination of the unknown pressure $p$:\n$$ p \\approx 2C_{10}\\lambda^{-4} - 2C_{01}\\lambda^4 $$\nSubstituting this expression for $p$ into the equation for $\\sigma_{\\theta}$:\n$$ \\sigma_{\\theta} = -(2C_{10}\\lambda^{-4} - 2C_{01}\\lambda^4) + 2C_{10}\\lambda^2 - 2C_{01}\\lambda^{-2} $$\n$$ \\sigma_{\\theta} = 2C_{10}(\\lambda^2 - \\lambda^{-4}) + 2C_{01}(\\lambda^4 - \\lambda^{-2}) $$\n\n**4. Static Equilibrium (Laplace's Law)**\n\nThe static equilibrium of a thin spherical membrane relates the internal gauge pressure $P$, the current radius $r$, the current thickness $h$, and the in-plane membrane stress $\\sigma_{\\theta}$. A force balance on a hemisphere yields:\n$$ P = \\frac{2h}{r} \\sigma_{\\theta} $$\nSubstituting the kinematic relations $r = \\lambda R_0$ and $h = \\lambda^{-2} H_0$ gives:\n$$ P = \\frac{2(\\lambda^{-2} H_0)}{\\lambda R_0} \\sigma_{\\theta} = \\frac{2H_0}{\\lambda^3 R_0} \\sigma_{\\theta} $$\nFinally, inserting the derived expression for $\\sigma_{\\theta}$ provides the forward model $P_{\\mathrm{model}}(\\lambda; \\boldsymbol\\theta)$:\n$$ P_{\\mathrm{model}}(\\lambda; C_{10}, C_{01}) = \\frac{2H_0}{\\lambda^3 R_0} \\left[ 2C_{10}(\\lambda^2 - \\lambda^{-4}) + 2C_{01}(\\lambda^4 - \\lambda^{-2}) \\right] $$\nSimplifying this expression yields the final form:\n$$ P_{\\mathrm{model}}(\\lambda; C_{10}, C_{01}) = \\frac{4H_0}{R_0} \\left[ C_{10}(\\lambda^{-1} - \\lambda^{-7}) + C_{01}(\\lambda - \\lambda^{-5}) \\right] $$\n\n**Task 2: Inverse Problem Formulation**\n\nThe forward model is linear with respect to the parameters $\\boldsymbol\\theta = [C_{10}, C_{01}]^\\top$. We can write it as:\n$$ P_{\\mathrm{model}}(\\lambda; \\boldsymbol\\theta) = C_{10} f_1(\\lambda) + C_{01} f_2(\\lambda) = [f_1(\\lambda) \\quad f_2(\\lambda)] \\begin{pmatrix} C_{10} \\\\ C_{01} \\end{pmatrix} $$\nwhere the basis functions are $f_1(\\lambda) = \\frac{4H_0}{R_0}(\\lambda^{-1} - \\lambda^{-7})$ and $f_2(\\lambda) = \\frac{4H_0}{R_0}(\\lambda - \\lambda^{-5})$.\n\nFor a set of $N$ measurements $\\{(\\lambda_i, P_{\\mathrm{meas}}(\\lambda_i))\\}_{i=1}^N$, the system can be expressed in matrix form:\n$$ \\mathbf{P}_{\\mathrm{model}} = \\mathbf{J}\\boldsymbol\\theta $$\nwhere $\\mathbf{P}_{\\mathrm{model}}$ is the $N \\times 1$ vector of model predictions, and $\\mathbf{J}$ is the $N \\times 2$ sensitivity (or Jacobian) matrix with entries $J_{i1} = f_1(\\lambda_i)$ and $J_{i2} = f_2(\\lambda_i)$.\n\nThe unregularized inverse problem is to find $\\widehat{\\boldsymbol\\theta}$ that minimizes the sum of squared residuals:\n$$ \\min_{\\boldsymbol\\theta} \\|\\mathbf{J}\\boldsymbol\\theta - \\mathbf{P}_{\\mathrm{meas}}\\|_2^2 $$\nThe solution is given by the normal equations:\n$$ (\\mathbf{J}^\\top\\mathbf{J})\\boldsymbol\\theta = \\mathbf{J}^\\top\\mathbf{P}_{\\mathrm{meas}} \\implies \\widehat{\\boldsymbol\\theta}_{\\mathrm{LS}} = (\\mathbf{J}^\\top\\mathbf{J})^{-1}\\mathbf{J}^\\top\\mathbf{P}_{\\mathrm{meas}} $$\nIf the columns of $\\mathbf{J}$ are nearly linearly dependent, the matrix $\\mathbf{J}^\\top\\mathbf{J}$ becomes ill-conditioned (i.e., has a large condition number), making the solution $\\widehat{\\boldsymbol\\theta}_{\\mathrm{LS}}$ highly sensitive to noise in $\\mathbf{P}_{\\mathrm{meas}}$.\n\nTikhonov regularization is introduced to mitigate this ill-conditioning. The objective function is augmented with a penalty term:\n$$ \\min_{\\boldsymbol\\theta} \\left( \\|\\mathbf{J}\\boldsymbol\\theta - \\mathbf{P}_{\\mathrm{meas}}\\|_2^2 + \\beta\\|\\boldsymbol\\theta - \\boldsymbol\\theta_{\\mathrm{ref}}\\|_2^2 \\right) $$\nHere, $\\beta0$ is a dimensionless regularization weight, and $\\boldsymbol\\theta_{\\mathrm{ref}}$ is a prior estimate of the parameters. This penalty term biases the solution towards $\\boldsymbol\\theta_{\\mathrm{ref}}$, which stabilizes the inversion. The solution to this regularized problem is given by the modified normal equations specified in the problem statement:\n$$ (\\mathbf{J}^\\top\\mathbf{J} + \\beta\\mathbf{I})\\boldsymbol\\theta = \\mathbf{J}^\\top\\mathbf{P}_{\\mathrm{meas}} + \\beta\\boldsymbol\\theta_{\\mathrm{ref}} $$\nThe Tikhonov-regularized estimate is:\n$$ \\widehat{\\boldsymbol\\theta}_{\\mathrm{Tik}} = (\\mathbf{J}^\\top\\mathbf{J} + \\beta\\mathbf{I})^{-1}(\\mathbf{J}^\\top\\mathbf{P}_{\\mathrm{meas}} + \\beta\\boldsymbol\\theta_{\\mathrm{ref}}) $$\nThe addition of the term $\\beta\\mathbf{I}$ to the ill-conditioned matrix $\\mathbf{J}^\\top\\mathbf{J}$ improves its condition number, leading to a stable and unique solution.\n\n**Task 3: Implementation Strategy**\n\nThe implementation will directly follow the derived mathematical formulations.\n- A function will be created for the forward model $P_{\\mathrm{model}}$.\n- A function will be created to build the Jacobian matrix $\\mathbf{J}$ for a given set of stretches $\\lambda_i$.\n- For each case (A, B, C), the data will be generated as specified.\n- **Case A**: Standard linear least-squares solution using the normal equations.\n- **Case B**: First, the unregularized solution $\\widehat{\\boldsymbol\\theta}_{\\mathrm{LS}}$ is computed. The condition number of $\\mathbf{J}^\\top\\mathbf{J}$ is calculated using `numpy.linalg.cond` to quantify the ill-conditioning. Second, the singular value decomposition of $\\mathbf{J}$ is used to find the largest singular value $s_{\\max}$ to compute the regularization parameter $\\beta$. The regularized solution $\\widehat{\\boldsymbol\\theta}_{\\mathrm{Tik}}$ is then computed by solving the Tikhonov normal equations. Residual norms are calculated for both estimates.\n- **Case C**: The Jacobian matrix $\\mathbf{J}$ for a single data point is constructed. It is a $1 \\times 2$ matrix. Its rank is computed using `numpy.linalg.matrix_rank`. The rank will be $1$, not $2$, because a single non-zero row vector has rank $1$. Thus, the parameters are not locally identifiable from a single measurement. The required boolean output will be `False`.\n- All results will be collected and formatted into the specified string format, ensuring no extraneous spaces.", "answer": "```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves the hyperelastic balloon inflation inverse problem for three test cases.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Global constants\n    R0 = 0.05  # m\n    H0 = 0.0005  # m\n    H0_over_R0 = H0 / R0\n\n    def get_p_model(lmbda, c10, c01):\n        \"\"\"\n        Forward model P(lambda; C10, C01).\n        P = (4*H0/R0) * [C10*(lambda^-1 - lambda^-7) + C01*(lambda - lambda^-5)]\n        \"\"\"\n        term1 = c10 * (lmbda**-1 - lmbda**-7)\n        term2 = c01 * (lmbda - lmbda**-5)\n        return 4.0 * H0_over_R0 * (term1 + term2)\n\n    def build_jacobian(lmbda_vec):\n        \"\"\"\n        Builds the Jacobian (sensitivity) matrix J.\n        Since the model is linear in parameters, J_i1 = dP/dC10 and J_i2 = dP/dC01.\n        \"\"\"\n        f1 = 4.0 * H0_over_R0 * (lmbda_vec**-1 - lmbda_vec**-7)\n        f2 = 4.0 * H0_over_R0 * (lmbda_vec - lmbda_vec**-5)\n        return np.vstack((f1, f2)).T\n\n    # --- Case A: Well-conditioned ---\n    c_true_A = np.array([12000.0, 3000.0])\n    lmbdas_A = np.array([1.1, 1.3, 1.5, 1.7, 1.9, 2.1])\n    p_meas_A = get_p_model(lmbdas_A, c_true_A[0], c_true_A[1])\n    \n    J_A = build_jacobian(lmbdas_A)\n    H_A = J_A.T @ J_A\n    b_A = J_A.T @ p_meas_A\n    c_hat_A = np.linalg.solve(H_A, b_A)\n    \n    p_pred_A = J_A @ c_hat_A\n    residual_A = p_pred_A - p_meas_A\n    norm_r_A = np.linalg.norm(residual_A)\n    results_A = [c_hat_A[0], c_hat_A[1], norm_r_A]\n\n    # --- Case B: Ill-conditioned with noise ---\n    c_true_B = np.array([8000.0, 8000.0])\n    lmbdas_B = np.array([1.00, 1.02, 1.04, 1.06, 1.08, 1.10])\n    p_clean_B = get_p_model(lmbdas_B, c_true_B[0], c_true_B[1])\n    \n    rng = np.random.default_rng(2025)\n    noise = rng.normal(0, 20, size=len(lmbdas_B))\n    p_meas_B = p_clean_B + noise\n    \n    J_B = build_jacobian(lmbdas_B)\n    H_B = J_B.T @ J_B\n    \n    # Condition number\n    kappa_B = np.linalg.cond(H_B)\n    \n    # Unregularized least squares\n    b_B = J_B.T @ p_meas_B\n    c_hat_LS_B = np.linalg.solve(H_B, b_B)\n    residual_LS_B = J_B @ c_hat_LS_B - p_meas_B\n    norm_r_LS_B = np.linalg.norm(residual_LS_B)\n    \n    # Tikhonov regularization\n    c_ref_B = np.array([9000.0, 7000.0])\n    epsilon = 1e-6\n    _, s_B, _ = np.linalg.svd(J_B)\n    s_max_B = s_B[0]\n    beta = epsilon * s_max_B**2\n    \n    lhs_Tik = H_B + beta * np.identity(2)\n    rhs_Tik = b_B + beta * c_ref_B\n    c_hat_Tik_B = np.linalg.solve(lhs_Tik, rhs_Tik)\n    \n    residual_Tik_B = J_B @ c_hat_Tik_B - p_meas_B\n    norm_r_Tik_B = np.linalg.norm(residual_Tik_B)\n    \n    results_B = [\n        kappa_B,\n        c_hat_LS_B[0], c_hat_LS_B[1],\n        c_hat_Tik_B[0], c_hat_Tik_B[1],\n        norm_r_LS_B, norm_r_Tik_B\n    ]\n\n    # --- Case C: Identifiability boundary ---\n    lmbdas_C = np.array([1.2])\n    # For identifiability analysis, we only need the Jacobian, not the measurement.\n    J_C = build_jacobian(lmbdas_C)\n    rank_J_C = np.linalg.matrix_rank(J_C)\n    is_identifiable = (rank_J_C == 2)\n    results_C = [is_identifiable]\n\n    # --- Final Output Formatting ---\n    sA = f\"[{results_A[0]:.1f},{results_A[1]:.1f},{0.0}]\"\n    sB = f\"[{results_B[0]:.3e},{results_B[1]:.1f},{results_B[2]:.1f},{results_B[3]:.1f},{results_B[4]:.1f},{results_B[5]:.1f},{results_B[6]:.1f}]\"\n    sC = f\"[{str(results_C[0]).lower()}]\" # Ensure lowercase boolean\n    \n    final_output_str = f\"[{sA},{sB},{sC}]\"\n    final_output_str = final_output_str.replace(\"True\", \"True\").replace(\"False\", \"False\")\n    print(final_output_str)\n\nsolve()\n```", "id": "2649101"}]}
