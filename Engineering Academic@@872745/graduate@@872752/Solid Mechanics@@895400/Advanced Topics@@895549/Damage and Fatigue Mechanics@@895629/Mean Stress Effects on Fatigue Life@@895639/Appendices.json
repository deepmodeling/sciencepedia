A fully reversed cycle is one that is perfectly symmetric about a zero stress level. This fundamental definition leads to several equivalent mathematical conditions:\n1.  The mean stress must be zero: $\\sigma_m = 0$.\n2.  Substituting the definition of $\\sigma_m$, we get $\\frac{\\sigma_{\\max} + \\sigma_{\\min}}{2} = 0$, which implies $\\sigma_{\\max} + \\sigma_{\\min} = 0$, or $\\sigma_{\\max} = -\\sigma_{\\min}$. This means the maximum and minimum stresses must have equal magnitude and opposite sign.\n3.  From the definition of the stress ratio $R$, if $\\sigma_{\\max} = -\\sigma_{\\min}$ (and $\\sigma_{\\max} \\neq 0$), then $R = \\frac{\\sigma_{\\min}}{\\sigma_{\\max}} = \\frac{-\\sigma_{\\max}}{\\sigma_{\\max}} = -1$.\n4.

From the fundamental definitions $\\sigma_{a} = (\\sigma_{\\max} - \\sigma_{\\min})/2$ and $\\sigma_{m} = (\\sigma_{\\max} + \\sigma_{\\min})/2$, we find $\\sigma_{\\max} = \\sigma_m + \\sigma_a$ and $\\sigma_{\\min} = \\sigma_m - \\sigma_a$.

This provides three sets of corrected data, each with $M=8$ points of the form $(\\sigma_{a,\\mathrm{eq}}, N)$.\n\nFinally, we compute the residual scatter for each model.
