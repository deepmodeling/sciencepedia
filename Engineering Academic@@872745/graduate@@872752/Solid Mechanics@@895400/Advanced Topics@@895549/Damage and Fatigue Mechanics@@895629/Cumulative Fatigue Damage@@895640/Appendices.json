It is based on established principles of solid mechanics, specifically the high-cycle fatigue behavior of metals described by a power-law stress-life (S-N) relationship (Basquin's relation) and the Palmgren-Miner linear damage accumulation rule. The provided data are sufficient and consistent for determining the two parameters of the power-law model and subsequently solving for the unknown stress amplitude. The values of stress and life are physically realistic for steel. The problem is therefore deemed valid and a solution will be provided.\n\nThe stress-life relationship in the high-cycle fatigue regime is given by a power law, commonly known as Basquin's equation. This can be expressed as:\n$$ S_a = A (N_f)^b $$\nwhere $S_a$ is the stress amplitude, $N_f$ is the number of cycles to failure, and $A$ and $b$ are material constants.\n\nThe two given data points, $(S_{a,1}, N_{f,1})$ and $(S_{a,2}, N_{f,2})$, can be used to determine the exponent $b$.\nWe have the system of two equations:\n$$ S_{a,1} = A (N_{f,1})^b $$\n$$ S_{a,2} = A (N_{f,2})^b $$\nDividing the first equation by the second eliminates the constant $A$:\n$$ \\frac{S_{a,1}}{S_{a,2}} = \\left(\\frac{N_{f,1}}{N_{f,2}}\\right)^b $$\nTo solve for $b$, we take the natural logarithm of both sides:\n$$ \\ln\\left(\\frac{S_{a,1}}{S_{a,2}}\\right) = b \\ln\\left(\\frac{N_{f,1}}{N_{f,2}}\\right) $$\nThus, the exponent $b$ is:\n$$ b = \\frac{\\ln(S_{a,1}/S_{a,2})}{\\ln(N_{f,1}/N_{f,2})} $$\nSubstituting the given values, $S_{a,1} = 350 \\ \\text{MPa}$, $N_{f,1} = 6.0 \\times 10^{5}$ cycles, $S_{a,2} = 250 \\ \\text{MPa}$, and $N_{f,2} = 5.0 \\times 10^{6}$ cycles:\n$$ b = \\frac{\\ln(350/250)}{\\ln(6.0 \\times 10^{5} / 5.0 \\times 10^{6})} = \\frac{\\ln(1.4)}{\\ln(0.12)} $$\n\nNext, we apply the Palmgren-Miner linear damage accumulation rule. The rule states that failure occurs when the cumulative damage $D$ reaches unity. The damage $D$ is the sum of the cycle ratios for each loading condition:\n$$ D = \\sum_i \\frac{n_i}{N_{f,i}} = 1 $$\nIn this problem, the service loading consists of $B = 12$ identical blocks, each with $n = 1.20 \\times 10^{5}$ cycles at a constant stress amplitude $S_a$. The total number of cycles applied is $n_{total} = B \\times n$. The number of cycles to failure at this stress amplitude is $N_f(S_a)$.\nThe damage equation simplifies to:\n$$ D = \\frac{n_{total}}{N_f(S_a)} = \\frac{B \\times n}{N_f(S_a)} = 1 $$\nTherefore, the shaft must be designed to have a fatigue life $N_f$ equal to the total number of applied cycles:\n$$ N_f(S_a) = B \\times n = 12 \\times (1.20 \\times 10^{5}) = 1.44 \\times 10^{6} \\ \\text{cycles} $$\n\nNow we must find the stress amplitude $S_a$ that corresponds to this required life $N_f(S_a)$. We can relate the unknown stress state $(S_a, N_f)$ to one of the known test points, for instance $(S_{a,1}, N_{f,1})$, using the S-N relation:\n$$ \\frac{S_a}{S_{a,1}} = \\left(\\frac{N_f}{N_{f,1}}\\right)^b $$\nSolving for $S_a$:\n$$ S_a = S_{a,1} \\left(\\frac{N_f}{N_{f,1}}\\right)^b $$\nSubstituting the numerical values:\n$$ S_a = 350 \\ \\text{MPa} \\times \\left(\\frac{1.44 \\times 10^{6}}{6.0 \\times 10^{5}}\\right)^{\\frac{\\ln(1.4)}{\\ln(0.12)}} $$\n$$ S_a = 350 \\times (2.4)^{\\frac{\\ln(1.4)}{\\ln(0.12)}} $$\nWe compute the values of the exponent and the final stress:\n$b \\approx \\frac{0.3364722}{ -2.1202635} \\approx -0.1586938$\n$$ S_a \\approx 350 \\times (2.4)^{-0.1586938} \\approx 350 \\times (0.87068) \\approx 304.738 \\ \\text{MPa} $$\nRounding to three significant figures as required, the maximum allowable stress amplitude is $S_a = 305 \\ \\text{MPa}$.\n\nThe second part of the problem requires determination of the logarithmic sensitivity of life to stress, $\\partial \\ln N_f / \\partial \\ln S_a$. We start with the S-N relation in logarithmic form:\n$$ \\ln(S_a) = \\ln(A) + b \\ln(N_f) $$\nRearranging for $\\ln(N_f)$:\n$$ \\ln(N_f) = \\frac{1}{b} (\\ln(S_a) - \\ln(A)) $$\nDifferentiating with respect to $\\ln(S_a)$ yields the sensitivity:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial \\ln(N_f)}{\\partial \\ln(S_a)} = \\frac{1}{b} $$\nThe sensitivity is the inverse of the Basquin exponent $b$.\n$$ \\frac{\\partial \\ln(N_f)}{\\partial \\ln(S_a)} = \\frac{1}{b} = \\frac{\\ln(N_{f,1}/N_{f,2})}{\\ln(S_{a,1}/S_{a,2})} = \\frac{\\ln(0.12)}{\\ln(1.4)} \\approx \\frac{-2.1202635}{0.3364722} \\approx -6.3015 $$\nThe interpretation of this result is that for small relative changes, $\\frac{\\Delta N_f}{N_f} \\approx \\frac{1}{b} \\frac{\\Delta S_a}{S_a}$. The large negative value demonstrates that fatigue life is highly sensitive to changes in stress amplitude. A $1\\%$ increase in stress amplitude ($\\frac{\\Delta S_a}{S_a} = 0.01$) leads to an approximate $6.3\\%$ decrease in fatigue life ($\\frac{\\Delta N_f}{N_f} \\approx -6.3 \\times 0.01 = -0.063$).

The closure term is $\\Delta K_{\\mathrm{cl}} = \\eta \\Delta K_{H}$.\nTo map this to damage, we find the ratio of the retarded growth rate to the standard growth rate. The assumption that crack length $a$ is approximately constant makes this ratio independent of $a$:\n$$\\phi = \\frac{(da/dN)_{\\text{ret}}}{(da/dN)} = \\frac{C(\\Delta K_{L} - \\eta \\Delta K_{H})^m}{C(\\Delta K_{L})^m} = \\left(\\frac{Y S_{L} \\sqrt{\\pi a} - \\eta Y S_{H} \\sqrt{\\pi a}}{Y S_{L} \\sqrt{\\pi a}}\\right)^{m} = \\left(1 - \\eta \\frac{S_{H}}{S_{L}}\\right)^{m}$$\nThis factor $\\phi$ represents the reduction in the rate of damage accumulation. The damage contribution from the low-stress block in the $H \\rightarrow L$ sequence is thus modified:\n$$D_{L, \\text{ret}} = \\phi \\cdot \\frac{n_{L}}{N_{f}(S_{L})} = \\left(1 - \\eta \\frac{S_{H}}{S_{L}}\\right)^{m} \\frac{n_{L}}{N_{f}(S_{L})}$$\nThe total nonlinear damage for the $H \\rightarrow L$ sequence is the sum of the contributions:\n$$D^{\\mathrm{nl}}_{H\\rightarrow L} = D_{H} + D_{L, \\text{ret}} = \\frac{n_{H}}{N_{f}(S_{H})} + \\left(1 - \\eta \\frac{S_{H}}{S_{L}}\\right)^{m} \\frac{n_{L}}{N_{f}(S_{L})}$$\n\nFinally, we compute the required difference, $\\Delta D^{\\ast}$:\n$$\\Delta D^{\\ast} = D^{\\mathrm{nl}}_{H\\rightarrow L} - D^{\\mathrm{nl}}_{L\\rightarrow H}$$\n$$= \\left[ \\frac{n_{H}}{N_{f}(S_{H})} + \\left(1 - \\eta \\frac{S_{H}}{S_{L}}\\right)^{m} \\frac{n_{L}}{N_{f}(S_{L})} \\right] - \\left[ \\frac{n_{L}}{N_{f}(S_{L})} + \\frac{n_{H}}{N_{f}(S_{H})} \\right]$$\nThe terms associated with the high-stress block, $n_{H}/N_{f}(S_{H})$, cancel out:\n$$\\Delta D^{\\ast} = \\left(1 - \\eta \\frac{S_{H}}{S_{L}}\\right)^{m} \\frac{n_{L}}{N_{f}(S_{L})} - \\frac{n_{L}}{N_{f}(S_{L})} = \\frac{n_{L}}{N_{f}(S_{L})} \\left[ \\left(1 - \\eta \\frac{S_{H}}{S_{L}}\\right)^{m} - 1 \\right]$$\nSubstitute $N_{f}(S_L) = K\\,S_{L}^{-b}$:\n$$\\Delta D^{\\ast} = \\frac{n_{L} S_{L}^{b}}{K} \\left[ \\left(1 - \\eta \\frac{S_{H}}{S_{L}}\\right)^{m} - 1 \\right]$$\nNow we substitute the given numerical values:\n$n_{L} = 1.0 \\times 10^{5}$\n$S_{L} = 300\\,\\mathrm{MPa}$\n$K = 1.0 \\times 10^{18}$\n$b = 5$\n$\\eta = 0.4$\n$S_{H} = 450\\,\\mathrm{MPa}$\n$m = 3$\n\nFirst, we evaluate the term for the low-stress block damage fraction:\n$$\\frac{n_{L} S_{L}^{b}}{K} = \\frac{(1.0 \\times 10^{5}) \\times (300)^{5}}{1.0 \\times 10^{18}} = \\frac{10^{5} \\times (3 \\times 10^{2})^{5}}{10^{18}} = \\frac{10^{5} \\times 3^{5} \\times 10^{10}}{10^{18}} = \\frac{243 \\times 10^{15}}{10^{18}} = 0.243$$\nNext, we evaluate the retardation factor term in the brackets:\n$$ \\left(1 - \\eta \\frac{S_{H}}{S_{L}}\\right)^{m} - 1 = \\left(1 - 0.4 \\times \\frac{450}{300}\\right)^{3} - 1 = \\left(1 - 0.4 \\times 1.5\\right)^{3} - 1 = (1 - 0.6)^{3} - 1 = (0.4)^{3} - 1 $$\n$$ (0.4)^{3} - 1 = 0.064 - 1 = -0.936 $$\nFinally, we compute $\\Delta D^{\\ast}$:\n$$ \\Delta D^{\\ast} = (0.243) \\times (-0.936) = -0.227448 $$\nRounding the result to four significant figures as requested gives:\n$$ \\Delta D^{\\ast} \\approx -0.2274 $$\nThe negative sign indicates, as expected, that the high-to-low sequence is less damaging than the low-to-high sequence, due to the retardation effect of the overload.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{-0.2274}$$", "id": "2628854"}]}
