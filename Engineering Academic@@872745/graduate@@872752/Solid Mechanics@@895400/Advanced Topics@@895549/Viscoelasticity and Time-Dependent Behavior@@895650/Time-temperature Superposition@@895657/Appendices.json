By working through this problem [@problem_id:2703375], you will gain hands-on experience in the full workflow, from raw data to a quantitative model of thermorheological behavior.", "problem": "You are given small-signal linear viscoelastic frequency-sweep measurements of the loss tangent, denoted by $\\tan\\delta(\\omega,T)$, where $\\omega$ is the angular frequency and $T$ is the temperature. In linear viscoelasticity, $\\tan\\delta$ is defined as the ratio $\\tan\\delta = G''/G'$, where $G'$ is the storage modulus and $G''$ is the loss modulus. Under the principle of time-temperature superposition for thermorheologically simple materials, frequency spectra at different temperatures are related by a purely horizontal shift in the $\\log_{10}\\omega$ domain. Let $T_r$ denote a reference temperature. The horizontal shift factor $a_T$ is defined by aligning the spectra at temperature $T$ to the reference spectrum at $T_r$ via the mapping $\\omega \\mapsto a_T\\,\\omega$. In particular, if the peak frequency of $\\tan\\delta(\\omega,T)$ at temperature $T$ is $\\omega_p(T)$, and the peak frequency at $T_r$ is $\\omega_p(T_r)$, then a fundamental and experimentally robust estimate of the shift factor is obtained by peak alignment:\n$$\na_T = \\frac{\\omega_p(T_r)}{\\omega_p(T)}.\n$$\nThe Williams–Landel–Ferry (WLF) relation connects the logarithm (base-$10$) of the shift factor $a_T$ to the temperature difference $(T - T_r)$ through two material constants. Your task is to compute $a_T$ for each temperature in each dataset by peak alignment and then identify the two WLF constants by fitting the standard WLF relation in base-$10$ logarithm. You must neither assume nor use any formula that directly gives the constants from $(T,a_T)$ pairs; instead, fit the two-parameter WLF relation in base-$10$ logarithm by minimizing the sum of squared residuals across the available temperatures.\n\nAll temperatures are in degrees Celsius, and all angular frequencies are in radians per second. When you report the final WLF constants, $C_1$ is dimensionless and $C_2$ must be reported in degrees Celsius. Round each constant to three decimal places for output.\n\nTest suite (three datasets).

It presents a standard data analysis task in the field of polymer rheology and solid mechanics, based on established principles of time-temperature superposition and the Williams–Landel–Ferry (WLF) relation. All necessary data and definitions are provided, and there are no internal contradictions or ambiguities. The problem is therefore deemed valid and a solution will be provided.\n\nThe objective is to determine the two material constants, $C_1$ and $C_2$, of the Williams–Landel–Ferry (WLF) equation for three distinct datasets. This is accomplished by first calculating the experimental shift factors, $a_T$, and then performing a nonlinear least-squares regression to fit the WLF model to the data.\n\nThe standard form of the WLF equation, using logarithm base-$10$, relates the temperature-dependent shift factor $a_T$ to the temperature $T$ and a chosen reference temperature $T_r$:\n$$\n\\log_{10}(a_T) = -\\frac{C_1 (T - T_r)}{C_2 + (T - T_r)}\n$$\nHere, $C_1$ is a dimensionless constant and $C_2$ is a constant with units of temperature, given here in degrees Celsius. These are the two parameters we must determine.\n\nThe first step is to calculate the experimental values of the shift factor, $a_T$, for each given temperature $T$. The problem provides the definition based on the alignment of the peak frequency, $\\omega_p$, of the loss tangent, $\\tan\\delta$:\n$$\na_T = \\frac{\\omega_p(T_r)}{\\omega_p(T)}\n$$\nFor each dataset, we are given a set of temperatures $\\{T_i\\}$, the corresponding measured peak frequencies $\\{\\omega_p(T_i)\\}$, and a reference temperature $T_r$. First, the peak frequency at the reference temperature, $\\omega_p(T_r)$, is identified from the supplied data. Then, for each temperature $T_i$ in the set, the shift factor $a_{T_i}$ is computed. Subsequently, the base-$10$ logarithm, $\\log_{10}(a_{T_i})$, is calculated. This procedure yields a set of data pairs $(x_i, y_i)$, where the independent variable is $x_i = T_i - T_r$ and the dependent variable is $y_i = \\log_{10}(a_{T_i})$. The problem requires including the data point for $T=T_r$, which corresponds to the origin $(0, 0)$ since $a_{T_r}=1$ and $\\log_{10}(1)=0$.\n\nThe second step is to determine the optimal values of $C_1$ and $C_2$ by fitting the WLF model to these experimental data pairs. The problem specifies that this must be done by minimizing the sum of squared residuals, $S$. The residual for each data point $i$ is the difference between the experimental value $y_i$ and the value predicted by the model, $f(x_i; C_1, C_2)$:\n$$\nr_i = y_i - f(x_i; C_1, C_2) = \\log_{10}(a_{T_i}) - \\left( -\\frac{C_1 (T_i - T_r)}{C_2 + (T_i - T_r)} \\right)\n$$\nThe sum of squared residuals is therefore:\n$$\nS(C_1, C_2) = \\sum_{i} r_i^2 = \\sum_{i} \\left[ \\log_{10}(a_{T_i}) + \\frac{C_1 (T_i - T_r)}{C_2 + (T_i - T_r)} \\right]^2\n$$\nFinding the parameters $C_1$ and $C_2$ that minimize $S$ is a nonlinear least-squares problem, as the model is a nonlinear function of the parameter $C_2$. This optimization will be performed numerically for each of the three datasets using a suitable algorithm, such as the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm, which is implemented in the `scipy.optimize.curve_fit` function.\n\nFor each dataset, the procedure is as follows:\n1.  Extract the reference temperature $T_r$, the array of temperatures $\\{T_i\\}$, and the array of peak frequencies $\\{\\omega_p(T_i)\\}$.\n2.  Identify $\\omega_p(T_r)$ from the data.\n3.  Compute the array of shift factors $\\{a_{T_i}\\}$ and their base-$10$ logarithms $\\{\\log_{10}(a_{T_i})\\}$.\n4.  Construct the array of temperature differences $\\{T_i-T_r\\}$.\n5.  Perform a nonlinear regression using the WLF model to find the best-fit values for $C_1$ and $C_2$.\n6.

For the second term, we replace the variable temperature $T$ with the specific temperature $\\tilde{T}_{r}$:\n$$\n\\log_{10} a(T \\to \\tilde{T}_{r}) = \\left( -C_{1}\\,\\frac{T - T_{r}}{C_{2} + (T - T_{r})} \\right) - \\left( -C_{1}\\,\\frac{\\tilde{T}_{r} - T_{r}}{C_{2} + (\\tilde{T}_{r} - T_{r})} \\right)\n$$\nFactoring out $-C_{1}$ and combining the two fractions yields:\n$$\n\\log_{10} a(T \\to \\tilde{T}_{r}) = -C_{1} \\left[ \\frac{T - T_{r}}{C_{2} + T - T_{r}} - \\frac{\\tilde{T}_{r} - T_{r}}{C_{2} + \\tilde{T}_{r} - T_{r}} \\right]\n$$\nTo combine the fractions, we find a common denominator:\n$$\n\\log_{10} a(T \\to \\tilde{T}_{r}) = -C_{1} \\left[ \\frac{(T - T_{r})(C_{2} + \\tilde{T}_{r} - T_{r}) - (\\tilde{T}_{r} - T_{r})(C_{2} + T - T_{r})}{(C_{2} + T - T_{r})(C_{2} + \\tilde{T}_{r} - T_{r})} \\right]\n$$\nLet us expand the numerator:\nNumerator $= (TC_{2} + T\\tilde{T}_{r} - TT_{r} - T_{r}C_{2} - T_{r}\\tilde{T}_{r} + T_{r}^{2}) - (\\tilde{T}_{r}C_{2} + \\tilde{T}_{r}T - \\tilde{T}_{r}T_{r} - T_{r}C_{2} - T_{r}T + T_{r}^{2})$\nAfter distributing the negative sign and canceling terms, the numerator simplifies significantly:\nNumerator $= TC_{2} - \\tilde{T}_{r}C_{2} = C_{2}(T - \\tilde{T}_{r})$\nSubstituting this simplified numerator back into the expression gives:\n$$\n\\log_{10} a(T \\to \\tilde{T}_{r}) = -C_{1} \\frac{C_{2}(T - \\tilde{T}_{r})}{(C_{2} + T - T_{r})(C_{2} + \\tilde{T}_{r} - T_{r})}\n$$\nOur goal is to show that this expression has the same WLF form with respect to the new reference temperature $\\tilde{T}_{r}$:\n$$\n\\log_{10} a(T \\to \\tilde{T}_{r}) = -\\tilde{C}_{1} \\frac{T - \\tilde{T}_{r}}{\\tilde{C}_{2} + (T - \\tilde{T}_{r})}\n$$\nTo match the forms, we manipulate the denominator of our derived expression. Let us rewrite the term $(C_{2} + T - T_{r})$ by adding and subtracting $\\tilde{T}_{r}$:\n$$\nC_{2} + T - T_{r} = (C_{2} + \\tilde{T}_{r} - T_{r}) + (T - \\tilde{T}_{r})\n$$\nLet us define a new constant $\\tilde{C}_{2} = C_{2} + \\tilde{T}_{r} - T_{r}$. With this definition, the term becomes $\\tilde{C}_{2} + (T - \\tilde{T}_{r})$.\nSubstituting this back into our expression for $\\log_{10} a(T \\to \\tilde{T}_{r})$:\n$$\n\\log_{10} a(T \\to \\tilde{T}_{r}) = -C_{1} \\frac{C_{2}(T - \\tilde{T}_{r})}{(\\tilde{C}_{2} + (T - \\tilde{T}_{r}))(C_{2} + \\tilde{T}_{r} - T_{r})}\n$$\nRecognizing that the second factor in the denominator is our defined $\\tilde{C}_{2}$, we have:\n$$\n\\log_{10} a(T \\to \\tilde{T}_{r}) = -C_{1} \\frac{C_{2}(T - \\tilde{T}_{r})}{(\\tilde{C}_{2} + (T - \\tilde{T}_{r})) \\tilde{C}_{2}}\n$$\nRearranging this gives:\n$$\n\\log_{10} a(T \\to \\tilde{T}_{r}) = - \\left( \\frac{C_{1}C_{2}}{\\tilde{C}_{2}} \\right) \\frac{T - \\tilde{T}_{r}}{\\tilde{C}_{2} + (T - \\tilde{T}_{r})}\n$$\nThis expression is now in the WLF form with respect to $\\tilde{T}_{r}$. By comparing this with the target form, we identify the new constants $\\tilde{C}_{1}$ and $\\tilde{C}_{2}$:\n$$\n\\tilde{C}_{1} = \\frac{C_{1}C_{2}}{\\tilde{C}_{2}} = \\frac{C_{1}C_{2}}{C_{2} + \\tilde{T}_{r} - T_{r}}\n$$\n$$\n\\tilde{C}_{2} = C_{2} + \\tilde{T}_{r} - T_{r}\n$$\nThis completes the derivation part of the problem.\n\nNow, we proceed to the numerical calculation. The given values are:\n$C_{1} = 17.44$\n$C_{2} = 51.6\\,\\mathrm{K}$\nThe initial reference temperature is the glass transition temperature, $T_{r} = T_{g}$.\nThe new reference temperature is $\\tilde{T}_{r} = T_{g} + 30\\,\\mathrm{K}$.\n\nThe difference in temperature is $\\Delta T = \\tilde{T}_{r} - T_{r} = (T_{g} + 30\\,\\mathrm{K}) - T_{g} = 30\\,\\mathrm{K}$.\nWe use the derived formula for $\\tilde{C}_{1}$ to calculate its new value:\n$$\n\\tilde{C}_{1} = \\frac{C_{1}C_{2}}{C_{2} + (\\tilde{T}_{r} - T_{r})} = \\frac{17.44 \\times 51.6}{51.6 + 30}\n$$\nCalculating the numerator and the denominator:\n$$\n\\tilde{C}_{1} = \\frac{899.904}{81.6}\n$$\nPerforming the division:\n$$\n\\tilde{C}_{1} \\approx 11.028235...\n$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures. The fifth significant figure is $8$, which is greater than or equal to $5$, so we round up the fourth significant figure.\n$$\n\\tilde{C}_{1} \\approx 11.03\n$$\nThis is the required numerical value for the transformed coefficient.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{11.03}\n$$", "id": "2703437"}]}
