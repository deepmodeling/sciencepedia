The derivation must be based on first principles of continuum mechanics.\n\nFirst, we validate the problem statement.\n**Step 1: Extract Givens**\n- **Geometry:** A prismatic bar occupying the spatial domain $x \\in [0, L]$ with constant cross-sectional area $A$.\n- **Stress Field:** A spatially uniform axial Cauchy stress $\\mathbf{\\sigma}$, where the only non-zero component is $\\sigma_{xx} = \\sigma(t)$.\n- **Velocity Field:** A spatially defined axial velocity field $\\mathbf{v}$, where the only non-zero component is $v_x(x,t) = \\alpha(t)x$.\n- **Assumptions:** Eulerian description, neglect of body forces and couple stresses.\n- **Task:** Derive the instantaneous internal power $P_{\\mathrm{int}}(t)$ in terms of $\\sigma(t), \\alpha(t), A, L$.\n\n**Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens**\nThe problem is scientifically grounded, using standard definitions from continuum mechanics (Cauchy stress, rate-of-deformation, principle of virtual power). It is well-posed, as all necessary information for the calculation is provided. The language is objective and precise. While the prescribed fields $\\mathbf{\\sigma}(t)$ and $\\mathbf{v}(x,t)$ may not satisfy Cauchy's equation of motion for a material with non-zero density ($\\rho \\neq 0$) and arbitrary $\\alpha(t)$, the problem does not require a full dynamic analysis. It asks for the evaluation of the internal power functional for the *given* fields. This is a standard and valid exercise in mechanics to test the understanding of kinematic and power concepts. Therefore, the problem is deemed valid.\n\n**Derivation of Internal Power**\n\nThe internal power, $P_{\\mathrm{int}}$, represents the rate at which mechanical work is done by stresses on the deforming material within its volume, $V$. It is defined as the volume integral of the stress power density, $w$.\n$$\nP_{\\mathrm{int}} = \\int_V w \\, dV\n$$\nThe local stress power density, $w$, is given by the double-dot product of the Cauchy stress tensor, $\\mathbf{\\sigma}$, and the rate-of-deformation tensor, $\\mathbf{D}$.\n$$\nw = \\mathbf{\\sigma} : \\mathbf{D}\n$$\nTo proceed, we must first determine the rate-of-deformation tensor $\\mathbf{D}$ from the given velocity field.\n\nThe velocity field is given in an Eulerian description as $\\mathbf{v}(x,t) = \\alpha(t)x \\mathbf{e}_x$, where $\\mathbf{e}_x$ is the unit vector along the bar's axis. In Cartesian coordinates $(x_1, x_2, x_3) = (x, y, z)$, the velocity vector components are $v_1 = \\alpha(t)x_1$, $v_2 = 0$, and $v_3 = 0$.\n\nThe velocity gradient tensor, $\\mathbf{L}$, is defined by its components $L_{ij} = \\frac{\\partial v_i}{\\partial x_j}$. We compute its components:\n$$\nL_{11} = \\frac{\\partial v_1}{\\partial x_1} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}(\\alpha(t)x) = \\alpha(t)\n$$\nAll other components of $\\mathbf{L}$ are zero since $v_2$ and $v_3$ are zero, and $v_1$ does not depend on $x_2$ or $x_3$. Thus, the velocity gradient tensor is:\n$$\n\\mathbf{L} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\alpha(t)  0  0 \\\\ 0  0  0 \\\\ 0  0  0 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe rate-of-deformation tensor, $\\mathbf{D}$, is the symmetric part of the velocity gradient tensor: $\\mathbf{D} = \\frac{1}{2}(\\mathbf{L} + \\mathbf{L}^T)$. Since $\\mathbf{L}$ is already a symmetric tensor in this case, we have $\\mathbf{D} = \\mathbf{L}$.\n$$\n\\mathbf{D} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\alpha(t)  0  0 \\\\ 0  0  0 \\\\ 0  0  0 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe term $\\alpha(t)$ is recognized as the rate of axial stretching, $D_{xx}$.\n\nThe stress field is a uniform uniaxial stress $\\sigma(t)$ along the $x$-axis. The Cauchy stress tensor is given by:\n$$\n\\mathbf{\\sigma} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\sigma(t)  0  0 \\\\ 0  0  0 \\\\ 0  0  0 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThis follows from the problem statement of a \"uniaxial bar\" subject to \"axial Cauchy stress\".\n\nNow we can compute the stress power density, $w = \\mathbf{\\sigma} : \\mathbf{D}$, as required by the problem's emphasis on clarifying this step. The double-dot product is the sum of the products of corresponding components:\n$$\nw = \\sum_{i=1}^{3} \\sum_{j=1}^{3} \\sigma_{ij} D_{ij} = \\sigma_{11}D_{11} + \\sigma_{22}D_{22} + \\sigma_{33}D_{33} + 2\\sigma_{12}D_{12} + 2\\sigma_{13}D_{13} + 2\\sigma_{23}D_{23}\n$$\nSubstituting the components of $\\mathbf{\\sigma}$ and $\\mathbf{D}$:\n$$\nw = \\sigma(t) \\cdot \\alpha(t) + 0 \\cdot 0 + 0 \\cdot 0 + 2 \\cdot 0 \\cdot 0 + ... = \\sigma(t) \\alpha(t)\n$$\nThis is the local rate of work per unit volume being done on the material.\n\nFinally, to find the total internal power, $P_{\\mathrm{int}}$, we integrate this density over the entire volume of the bar. The volume element is $dV = A \\, dx$. The bar extends from $x=0$ to $x=L$.\n$$\nP_{\\mathrm{int}}(t) = \\int_V w \\, dV = \\int_V \\sigma(t) \\alpha(t) \\, dV\n$$\nSince both $\\sigma(t)$ and $\\alpha(t)$ are spatially uniform (independent of $x$), they can be taken outside the integral.\n$$\nP_{\\mathrm{int}}(t) = \\sigma(t) \\alpha(t) \\int_V dV\n$$\nThe total volume $V$ of the prismatic bar is its cross-sectional area $A$ multiplied by its length $L$, so $V = A L$.\n$$\nP_{\\mathrm{int}}(t) = \\sigma(t) \\alpha(t) (A L)\n$$\nThis provides the instantaneous internal power for the entire bar. The units are $(\\text{Force}/\\text{Area}) \\times (1/\\text{Time}) \\times (\\text{Area} \\times \\text{Length}) = (\\text{Force} \\times \\text{Length}) / \\text{Time}$, which corresponds to Power (e.g., Watts in SI units), as requested.\n\nA brief physical interpretation of the sign of $P_{\\mathrm{int}}$: The term $\\alpha(t)$ represents the axial strain rate. If the stress $\\sigma(t)$ and strain rate $\\alpha(t)$ have the same sign (e.g., tension and elongation, or compression and shortening), then $P_{\\mathrm{int}} > 0$. This signifies that power is being supplied to the material, increasing its internal energy (either as stored elastic energy or dissipated as heat). If they have opposite signs (e.g., tension during shortening), then $P_{\\mathrm{int}}  0$, signifying that the material is releasing energy and doing work on its surroundings.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\sigma \\alpha A L}\n$$", "id": "2691185"}, {"introduction": "The power supplied to a material is not monolithic; it partitions into energy that is stored and can be recovered, and energy that is dissipated, typically as heat.

It is a standard exercise in continuum mechanics. Therefore, I will proceed with the solution.\n\nSolution:\n\nThe solution is constructed in three parts as requested by the problem statement.\n\nPart 1: Derivation of the dissipation rate $D(t)$ and proof of non-negativity.\n\nThe internal dissipation rate per unit volume, $D(t)$, is defined as:\n$$D(t) = \\sigma(t)\\,\\dot{\\varepsilon}(t) - \\dot{\\psi}(t)$$\nFirst, we find the material time derivative of the Helmholtz free energy, $\\dot{\\psi}(t)$. The free energy is given as $\\psi(\\varepsilon) = \\frac{1}{2} E\\,\\varepsilon^{2}$. Using the chain rule for differentiation with respect to time $t$:\n$$\\dot{\\psi}(t) = \\frac{d\\psi}{d\\varepsilon} \\frac{d\\varepsilon}{dt} = \\left(\\frac{d}{d\\varepsilon} \\left(\\frac{1}{2} E\\,\\varepsilon^{2}\\right)\\right) \\dot{\\varepsilon}(t) = (E\\,\\varepsilon(t))\\,\\dot{\\varepsilon}(t)$$\nNext, we substitute the constitutive equation for stress, $\\sigma(t) = E\\,\\varepsilon(t) + \\eta\\,\\dot{\\varepsilon}(t)$, and the expression for $\\dot{\\psi}(t)$ into the definition of $D(t)$:\n$$D(t) = \\left(E\\,\\varepsilon(t) + \\eta\\,\\dot{\\varepsilon}(t)\\right)\\,\\dot{\\varepsilon}(t) - \\left(E\\,\\varepsilon(t)\\,\\dot{\\varepsilon}(t)\\right)$$\nExpanding the first term gives:\n$$D(t) = E\\,\\varepsilon(t)\\,\\dot{\\varepsilon}(t) + \\eta\\,\\left(\\dot{\\varepsilon}(t)\\right)^{2} - E\\,\\varepsilon(t)\\,\\dot{\\varepsilon}(t)$$\nThe terms involving the Young's modulus $E$ cancel, leaving the final expression for the dissipation rate:\n$$D(t) = \\eta\\,\\left(\\dot{\\varepsilon}(t)\\right)^{2}$$\nThis is the explicit expression for $D(t)$ in terms of $\\dot{\\varepsilon}(t)$ and $\\eta$. The physical meaning is clear: for a Kelvin-Voigt material, dissipation is solely due to the viscous part of the stress.\n\nTo show that $D(t)$ is nonnegative for all times, we analyze this expression. The viscosity $\\eta$ is a physical material constant representing resistance to flow, and for passive materials, it must be non-negative, i.e., $\\eta \\ge 0$. The term $(\\dot{\\varepsilon}(t))^{2}$ is the square of the strain rate, which is a real-valued function of time. The square of any real number is always non-negative. Therefore, the product of two non-negative quantities is also non-negative:\n$$D(t) = \\eta\\,\\left(\\dot{\\varepsilon}(t)\\right)^{2} \\ge 0 \\quad \\text{for all } t$$\nThis satisfies the Clausius–Duhem inequality, confirming the thermodynamic consistency of the Kelvin–Voigt model.\n\nPart 2: Derivation of the dissipated energy per cycle, $W_{\\mathrm{diss}}$.\n\nThe energy dissipated per unit volume over one cycle of duration $T = 1/f$ is given by the integral:\n$$W_{\\mathrm{diss}} = \\int_{0}^{T} D(t)\\,dt = \\int_{0}^{1/f} \\eta\\,\\left(\\dot{\\varepsilon}(t)\\right)^{2}\\,dt$$\nFirst, we must determine the strain rate, $\\dot{\\varepsilon}(t)$, from the prescribed strain function $\\varepsilon(t) = \\varepsilon_{0}\\,\\sin(2\\pi f\\,t)$:\n$$\\dot{\\varepsilon}(t) = \\frac{d}{dt} \\left(\\varepsilon_{0}\\,\\sin(2\\pi f\\,t)\\right) = 2\\pi f\\,\\varepsilon_{0}\\,\\cos(2\\pi f\\,t)$$\nNow, substitute this expression for $\\dot{\\varepsilon}(t)$ into the integral for $W_{\\mathrm{diss}}$:\n$$W_{\\mathrm{diss}} = \\int_{0}^{1/f} \\eta\\,\\left(2\\pi f\\,\\varepsilon_{0}\\,\\cos(2\\pi f\\,t)\\right)^{2}\\,dt$$\n$$W_{\\mathrm{diss}} = \\int_{0}^{1/f} \\eta\\,(2\\pi f\\,\\varepsilon_{0})^{2}\\,\\cos^{2}(2\\pi f\\,t)\\,dt$$\nThe terms $\\eta$, $(2\\pi f\\,\\varepsilon_{0})^{2}$ are constants with respect to time, so they can be moved outside the integral:\n$$W_{\\mathrm{diss}} = 4\\pi^{2} f^{2} \\varepsilon_{0}^{2} \\eta \\int_{0}^{1/f} \\cos^{2}(2\\pi f\\,t)\\,dt$$\nTo evaluate the integral, we use the trigonometric identity $\\cos^{2}(\\theta) = \\frac{1}{2}(1 + \\cos(2\\theta))$.

It is a well-defined exercise in computational continuum mechanics that is scientifically grounded, self-contained, and objective. It addresses the important topic of numerical dissipation in hypoelastic and hyperelastic constitutive model implementations under large deformation. The provided equations, numerical schemes, and parameters are consistent and allow for a unique solution.\n\nThe problem requires the implementation and comparison of three different objective stress update schemes for an isotropic elastic solid subjected to finite simple shear. The core task is to compute the numerical internal dissipation, $\\mathcal{D}_{\\text{int}}$, generated by each scheme. This dissipation is defined as the difference between the total stress power (work input per unit volume), $W_{\\text{in}}$, and the change in the stored elastic energy density, $\\Delta\\Psi$, over the deformation process.\n\nThe deformation is a plane simple shear with a constant velocity gradient $\\mathbf{L}$, given by:\n$$\n\\mathbf{L} = \\begin{bmatrix} 0  \\dot{\\gamma}  0 \\\\ 0  0  0 \\\\ 0  0  0 \\end{bmatrix}\n$$\nwhere $\\dot{\\gamma}$ is the constant shear rate. The rate of deformation tensor $\\mathbf{D}$ and the spin tensor $\\mathbf{W}$ are the symmetric and skew-symmetric parts of $\\mathbf{L}$, respectively. The deformation gradient evolves according to $\\dot{\\mathbf{F}}=\\mathbf{L}\\mathbf{F}$ with $\\mathbf{F}(0)=\\mathbf{I}$. For a time interval $[0, T]$, this results in $\\mathbf{F}(t) = \\mathbf{I} + t\\mathbf{L}$.\n\nThe change in stored energy, $\\Delta\\Psi$, is determined by a specified Hencky-type energy function, $\\Psi(\\mathbf{h})$, which depends on the logarithmic strain $\\mathbf{h} = \\log\\mathbf{V}$, where $\\mathbf{V}$ is the left stretch tensor from the polar decomposition $\\mathbf{F}=\\mathbf{R}\\mathbf{V}$. The function is:\n$$\n\\Psi(\\mathbf{h}) = G\\,\\mathrm{dev}(\\mathbf{h}):\\mathrm{dev}(\\mathbf{h}) + \\frac{\\kappa}{2}\\left(\\mathrm{tr}(\\mathbf{h})\\right)^2\n$$\nFor simple shear, the deformation is volume-preserving ($\\det\\mathbf{F}=1$), which implies $\\mathrm{tr}(\\mathbf{h})=\\log(\\det\\mathbf{V})=\\log(\\det\\mathbf{F})=0$. Thus, the stored energy simplifies to $\\Psi(\\mathbf{h}) = G\\,\\mathrm{dev}(\\mathbf{h}):\\mathrm{dev}(\\mathbf{h})$. Since the process starts from an undeformed state ($\\mathbf{F}(0)=\\mathbf{I}$, $\\mathbf{h}(0)=\\mathbf{0}$), the total change in stored energy is $\\Delta\\Psi = \\Psi(\\mathbf{h}(T))$. This value is computed once for each test case based on the final deformation $\\mathbf{F}(T)$ and is common to all three schemes. The numerical implementation requires a robust method for polar decomposition of $\\mathbf{F}$ to find $\\mathbf{h} = \\log\\mathbf{V}$, which is accomplished via the spectral decomposition of the left Cauchy-Green tensor $\\mathbf{B}=\\mathbf{F}\\mathbf{F}^\\mathsf{T}$.\n\nThe stress power, $W_{\\text{in}}$, is computed by numerically integrating $\\boldsymbol{\\tau}:\\mathbf{D}$ over the time interval $[0, T]$ using the midpoint rule:\n$$\nW_{\\text{in}} \\approx \\sum_{n=0}^{N-1} \\boldsymbol{\\tau}_{n+\\frac{1}{2}} : \\mathbf{D}\\,\\Delta t\n$$\nwhere $\\boldsymbol{\\tau}_{n+\\frac{1}{2}}$ is the Kirchhoff stress tensor approximated at the midpoint of each time step $[t_n, t_{n+1}]$. The method for obtaining $\\boldsymbol{\\tau}_{n+\\frac{1}{2}}$ differs for each of the three schemes.\n\nThe three schemes are implemented as follows:\n\n1.  **Jaumann Rate Scheme:** This is a hypoelastic model where the Jaumann rate of the Kirchhoff stress is proportional to the rate of deformation: $\\stackrel{\\triangle}{\\boldsymbol{\\tau}} = 2G\\,\\mathbf{D}$. This objective rate is defined as $\\stackrel{\\triangle}{\\boldsymbol{\\tau}} = \\dot{\\boldsymbol{\\tau}} + \\boldsymbol{\\tau}\\mathbf{W} - \\mathbf{W}\\boldsymbol{\\tau}$. This gives a first-order ordinary differential equation for the stress tensor $\\boldsymbol{\\tau}$. We integrate this ODE using the explicit midpoint (second-order Runge-Kutta) method. At each time step from $\\boldsymbol{\\tau}_n$, we compute a trial stress at the midpoint, $\\boldsymbol{\\tau}_{n+\\frac{1}{2}}$, which is then used both to calculate the stress power increment for that step and to complete the full-step update to $\\boldsymbol{\\tau}_{n+1}$.\n\n2.  **Green–Naghdi Rate Scheme:** This scheme also uses a corotational rate, but one based on the spin of the material rotation $\\mathbf{R}$ from the polar decomposition, $\\boldsymbol{\\Omega}=\\dot{\\mathbf{R}}\\mathbf{R}^\\mathsf{T}$. The constitutive law is $\\stackrel{\\nabla}{\\boldsymbol{\\tau}} = 2G\\,\\mathbf{D}$, where $\\stackrel{\\nabla}{\\boldsymbol{\\tau}}=\\dot{\\boldsymbol{\\tau}}+\\boldsymbol{\\tau}\\boldsymbol{\\Omega}-\\boldsymbol{\\Omega}\\boldsymbol{\\tau}$. This is numerically implemented in a rotationally-neutralized framework by evolving the corotated stress $\\mathbf{S}=\\mathbf{R}^\\mathsf{T}\\boldsymbol{\\tau}\\mathbf{R}$. The evolution equation becomes $\\dot{\\mathbf{S}} = 2G (\\mathbf{R}^\\mathsf{T}\\mathbf{D}\\mathbf{R})$. We integrate this using an explicit scheme where the rate is evaluated at the midpoint time $t_{n+\\frac{1}{2}}$, requiring the polar decomposition of $\\mathbf{F}_{n+\\frac{1}{2}}$. The mid-step stress $\\boldsymbol{\\tau}_{n+\\frac{1}{2}}$ for the power calculation is constructed by a prescribed rule involving a mid-step update of $\\mathbf{S}_{n+\\frac{1}{2}}$ and rotation back to the spatial frame using $\\mathbf{R}_{n+\\frac{1}{2}}$.\n\n3.  **Logarithmic Scheme:** This approach defines the stress directly from the strain state at any given time, making it a hyperelastic model. The Kirchhoff stress is given by $\\boldsymbol{\\tau} = 2G\\,\\mathrm{dev}(\\mathbf{h})$. To calculate the stress power, the stress tensor $\\boldsymbol{\\tau}_{n+\\frac{1}{2}}$ is computed by first finding the deformation gradient $\\mathbf{F}_{n+\\frac{1}{2}}$ at the midpoint of the time step, performing a polar decomposition to find the logarithmic strain $\\mathbf{h}_{n+\\frac{1}{2}}$, and then evaluating the constitutive relation. Although this model is elastic by construction, the definition of stress power via $\\boldsymbol{\\tau}:\\mathbf{D}$ (rather than the energetically conjugate $\\boldsymbol{\\tau}:\\dot{\\mathbf{h}}$) can lead to non-zero dissipation in the discrete setting, which this calculation will quantify. We expect this dissipation to be small, reflecting the numerical integration error.\n\nFor each test case defined by total shear $\\gamma_{\\text{tot}}$ and number of steps $N$, we compute $\\mathcal{D}_{\\text{int}} = W_{\\text{in}} - \\Delta\\Psi$ for each of the three schemes. The final output is a list of these computed dissipation values.", "answer": "```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef polar_decomposition(F):\n    \"\"\"\n    Computes the polar decomposition F = R V and logarithmic strain h = log(V).\n    \n    Args:\n        F (np.ndarray): 3x3 a single deformation gradient.\n        \n    Returns:\n        tuple: A tuple containing:\n            R (np.ndarray): 3x3 rotation tensor.\n            V (np.ndarray): 3x3 left stretch tensor.\n            h (np.ndarray): 3x3 Hencky (logarithmic) strain tensor.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Using float64 for precision in eigen decomposition\n    B = F @ F.T\n    \n    try:\n        # Use eigh for symmetric matrices\n        evals, evecs = np.linalg.eigh(B.astype(np.float64))\n    except np.linalg.LinAlgError:\n        # Failsafe for singular matrices, though not expected here\n        return np.eye(3), np.eye(3), np.zeros((3, 3))\n\n    # Clamp small negative eigenvalues that can arise from numerical noise\n    evals[evals  0] = 0\n    \n    # Calculate V from spectral decomposition of B\n    sqrt_evals = np.sqrt(evals)\n    V = evecs @ np.diag(sqrt_evals) @ evecs.T\n\n    # Calculate h = log(V)\n    # Use log of eigenvalues of B, which is more stable than log(sqrt_evals)\n    log_h_evals = 0.5 * np.log(evals, where=evals>0, out=np.zeros_like(evals))\n    h = evecs @ np.diag(log_h_evals) @ evecs.T\n\n    # Calculate R = F V^{-1}\n    inv_sqrt_evals = 1.0 / sqrt_evals\n    inv_sqrt_evals[~np.isfinite(inv_sqrt_evals)] = 0 # Handle division by zero if an eigenvalue is 0\n    V_inv = evecs @ np.diag(inv_sqrt_evals) @ evecs.T\n    R = F @ V_inv\n\n    return R, V, h\n\ndef calculate_dissipation_jaumann(N, dt, G, D, W, delta_psi):\n    \"\"\"Calculates dissipation for the Jaumann rate scheme.\"\"\"\n    tau = np.zeros((3, 3))\n    W_in = 0.0\n\n    # Explicit midpoint (RK2) method for ODE: d(tau)/dt = f(tau, t)\n    for _ in range(N):\n        # f(tau) = 2*G*D -
