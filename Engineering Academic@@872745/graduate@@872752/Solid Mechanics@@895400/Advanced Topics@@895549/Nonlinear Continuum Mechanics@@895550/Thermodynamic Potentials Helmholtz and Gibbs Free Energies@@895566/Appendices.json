This quantity represents the strain energy density stored in the material at equilibrium, which can also be written as $\\frac{1}{2}\\sigma_0\\varepsilon_{eq}$.\n\n5) We are asked to evaluate $\\Delta e$ for $E = 210\\,\\mathrm{GPa}$ and $\\sigma_0 = 210\\,\\mathrm{MPa}$. We must use consistent units. Let's use SI units:\n$E = 210\\,\\mathrm{GPa} = 210 \\times 10^9\\,\\mathrm{Pa}$.\n$\\sigma_0 = 210\\,\\mathrm{MPa} = 210 \\times 10^6\\,\\mathrm{Pa}$.\nThe unit of energy density is Joules per cubic meter, $\\mathrm{J/m^3}$, which is equivalent to Pascals, $\\mathrm{Pa}$.\n$$\n\\Delta e = \\frac{1}{2}\\frac{\\sigma_0^2}{E} = \\frac{1}{2} \\frac{(210 \\times 10^6\\,\\mathrm{Pa})^2}{210 \\times 10^9\\,\\mathrm{Pa}} = \\frac{1}{2} \\frac{210^2 \\times 10^{12}}{210 \\times 10^9} \\,\\mathrm{Pa} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 210 \\times 10^3 \\,\\mathrm{Pa}.\n$$\n$$\n\\Delta e = 105 \\times 10^3 \\,\\mathrm{J/m^3}.\n$$\nThe problem requires the answer in kilojoules per cubic meter, $\\mathrm{kJ/m^3}$. Since $1\\,\\mathrm{kJ} = 10^3\\,\\mathrm{J}$, we have\n$$\n\\Delta e = 105 \\,\\mathrm{kJ/m^3}.\n$$\nThe final answer must be rounded to four significant figures. This gives $105.0$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{105.0}$$", "id": "2702115"}]}
