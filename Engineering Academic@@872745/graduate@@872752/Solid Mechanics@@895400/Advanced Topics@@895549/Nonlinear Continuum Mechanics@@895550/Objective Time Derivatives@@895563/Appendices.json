The problem is otherwise a standard, well-posed exercise in continuum mechanics and is therefore deemed valid. We proceed with the solution by systematically addressing the five specified tasks.\n\n1) Computation of Deformation-Rate and Spin Tensors\n\nThe velocity gradient tensor $L$ is given as\n$$L = \\begin{bmatrix} 0 & \\dot{\\gamma} & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\end{bmatrix}$$\nThe deformation-rate tensor $D$ is the symmetric part of $L$, and the spin tensor $W$ is the skew-symmetric part of $L$.\n$$ D = \\frac{1}{2}(L + L^T) $$\n$$ W = \\frac{1}{2}(L - L^T) $$\nThe transpose of $L$ is\n$$ L^T = \\begin{bmatrix} 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ \\dot{\\gamma} & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\end{bmatrix} $$\nTherefore, the deformation-rate tensor is\n$$ D = \\frac{1}{2} \\left( \\begin{bmatrix} 0 & \\dot{\\gamma} & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\end{bmatrix} + \\begin{bmatrix} 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ \\dot{\\gamma} & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\end{bmatrix} \\right) = \\frac{\\dot{\\gamma}}{2} \\begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 & 0 \\\\ 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\end{bmatrix} $$\nAnd the spin tensor is\n$$ W = \\frac{1}{2} \\left( \\begin{bmatrix} 0 & \\dot{\\gamma} & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\end{bmatrix} - \\begin{bmatrix} 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ \\dot{\\gamma} & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\end{bmatrix} \\right) = \\frac{\\dot{\\gamma}}{2} \\begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 & 0 \\\\ -1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\end{bmatrix} $$\n\n2) Derivation of Objective Stress Rates\n\nObjective time rates are necessary to formulate constitutive laws in a manner that is independent of the observer's rigid body motion. A corotational rate of a second-rank tensor $\\sigma$ is of the general form $\\sigma^\\circ = \\dot{\\sigma} + \\sigma\\Omega_s - \\Omega_s\\sigma$, where $\\dot{\\sigma}$ is the material time derivative and $\\Omega_s$ is a spin tensor that characterizes the rotation of the reference frame in which the rate is measured.\n\nThe Jaumann rate, denoted $\\sigma^{\\circ}$, uses the spin tensor $W$ as its rotational generator. $W$, being the skew-symmetric part of the velocity gradient, represents the instantaneous rate of rotation of the principal axes of the deformation rate tensor $D$.\n$$ \\sigma^{\\circ} = \\dot{\\sigma} + \\sigma W - W\\sigma $$\n\nThe Green–Naghdi rate, denoted $\\sigma^{\\circ}_{GN}$, uses the spin of the material axes, $\\Omega = \\dot{R}R^T$, where $R$ is the rotation tensor from the polar decomposition of the deformation gradient, $F=RU$. This spin tensor describes the rotation of the material itself.\n$$ \\sigma^{\\circ}_{GN} = \\dot{\\sigma} + \\sigma\\Omega - \\Omega\\sigma $$\n\nThe Truesdell rate, denoted $\\sigma^{\\circ}_T$ or $\\overset{\\triangle}{\\sigma}$, is a Lie derivative-based rate. It is defined as the push-forward of the material time derivative of the 2nd Piola-Kirchhoff stress tensor $S$. The relationship between Cauchy stress $\\sigma$ and $S$ is $S = J F^{-1}\\sigma(F^{-1})^T$, where $J=\\det(F)$. The Truesdell rate is given by $\\sigma^{\\circ}_T = \\frac{1}{J} F \\dot{S} F^T$. A direct calculation yields its form in terms of Eulerian quantities:\n$$ \\sigma^{\\circ}_T = \\dot{\\sigma} - L\\sigma - \\sigma L^T + (\\text{tr}(L))\\sigma $$\nSince $\\text{tr}(L) = \\text{tr}(D)$, it can also be written as:\n$$ \\sigma^{\\circ}_T = \\dot{\\sigma} - L\\sigma - \\sigma L^T + (\\text{tr}(D))\\sigma $$\nThis rate is associated with a coordinate system that is convected with the material. The velocity gradient tensor $L$ itself is the rotational generator in this more complex formulation.\n\n3) Material Rotation Rate for Simple Shear\n\nFor simple shear, the motion is described by $x_1 = X_1 + \\Gamma(t)X_2$, $x_2 = X_2$, $x_3 = X_3$, where $\\Gamma(t) = \\int_0^t \\dot{\\gamma}(s)\\,ds$ is the accumulated shear. The deformation gradient $F = \\partial x / \\partial X$ is\n$$ F(t) = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & \\Gamma(t) & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 1 \\end{bmatrix} $$\nThe polar decomposition is $F=RU$. The rotation tensor $R$ can be found by requiring the right stretch tensor $U = R^T F$ to be symmetric. Let $R$ be a rotation in the $x_1$-$x_2$ plane by an angle $\\theta(t)$.\n$$ R = \\begin{bmatrix} \\cos\\theta & \\sin\\theta & 0 \\\\ -\\sin\\theta & \\cos\\theta & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 1 \\end{bmatrix} $$\nThen $U = R^T F$ is\n$$ U = \\begin{bmatrix} \\cos\\theta & -\\sin\\theta & 0 \\\\ \\sin\\theta & \\cos\\theta & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 1 \\end{bmatrix} \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & \\Gamma & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 1 \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} \\cos\\theta & \\Gamma\\cos\\theta-\\sin\\theta & 0 \\\\ \\sin\\theta & \\Gamma\\sin\\theta+\\cos\\theta & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 1 \\end{bmatrix} $$\nSymmetry of $U$ requires $U_{12} = U_{21}$, so $\\Gamma\\cos\\theta - \\sin\\theta = \\sin\\theta$, which simplifies to $\\tan\\theta = \\Gamma/2$.\nThe material rotation rate tensor is $\\Omega = \\dot{R}R^T$. For a planar rotation, this simplifies to\n$$ \\Omega = \\dot{\\theta} \\begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 & 0 \\\\ -1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\end{bmatrix} $$\nWe find $\\dot{\\theta}$ by differentiating $\\theta = \\arctan(\\Gamma/2)$ with respect to time $t$:\n$$ \\dot{\\theta} = \\frac{d}{dt}\\left(\\arctan\\left(\\frac{\\Gamma}{2}\\right)\\right) = \\frac{1}{1+(\\Gamma/2)^2} \\cdot \\frac{\\dot{\\Gamma}}{2} $$\nSince $\\dot{\\Gamma} = \\dot{\\gamma}$, we have\n$$ \\dot{\\theta} = \\frac{1}{1+\\Gamma^2/4} \\cdot \\frac{\\dot{\\gamma}}{2} = \\frac{4}{4+\\Gamma^2} \\cdot \\frac{\\dot{\\gamma}}{2} = \\frac{2\\dot{\\gamma}}{4+\\Gamma^2} $$\nThus, the material rotation rate is\n$$ \\Omega = \\frac{2\\dot{\\gamma}(t)}{4+\\Gamma(t)^2} \\begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 & 0 \\\\ -1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\end{bmatrix} $$\n\n4) Specialization of Objective Rate Components\n\nWe now compute the $11$-component of each objective stress rate for the given simple shear flow and stress state $\\sigma$.\n\nJaumann rate: $(\\sigma^{\\circ})_{11} = \\dot{\\sigma}_{11} + (\\sigma W)_{11} - (W\\sigma)_{11}$.\nThe term $(W\\sigma)_{11} = \\sum_k W_{1k}\\sigma_{k1} = W_{11}\\sigma_{11} + W_{12}\\sigma_{21} = (0)(\\sigma_{11}) + (\\dot{\\gamma}/2)(\\sigma_{12}) = \\frac{\\dot{\\gamma}}{2}\\sigma_{12}$.\nThe term $(\\sigma W)_{11} = \\sum_k \\sigma_{1k}W_{k1} = \\sigma_{11}W_{11} + \\sigma_{12}W_{21} = (\\sigma_{11})(0) + (\\sigma_{12})(-\\dot{\\gamma}/2) = -\\frac{\\dot{\\gamma}}{2}\\sigma_{12}$.\nSo, $(\\sigma^{\\circ})_{11} = \\dot{\\sigma}_{11} - \\frac{\\dot{\\gamma}}{2}\\sigma_{12} - \\frac{\\dot{\\gamma}}{2}\\sigma_{12} = \\dot{\\sigma}_{11} - \\dot{\\gamma}\\sigma_{12}$.\n\nGreen–Naghdi rate: $(\\sigma^{\\circ}_{GN})_{11} = \\dot{\\sigma}_{11} + (\\sigma\\Omega)_{11} - (\\Omega\\sigma)_{11}$.\nThis has the same structure as the Jaumann rate, with $W$ replaced by $\\Omega$. Let $\\omega = \\dot{\\theta} = \\frac{2\\dot{\\gamma}}{4+\\Gamma^2}$.\n$(\\Omega\\sigma)_{11} = \\omega\\sigma_{12}$.\n$(\\sigma\\Omega)_{11} = -\\omega\\sigma_{12}$.\nSo, $(\\sigma^{\\circ}_{GN})_{11} = \\dot{\\sigma}_{11} - \\omega\\sigma_{12} - \\omega\\sigma_{12} = \\dot{\\sigma}_{11} - 2\\omega\\sigma_{12} = \\dot{\\sigma}_{11} - \\frac{4\\dot{\\gamma}}{4+\\Gamma^2}\\sigma_{12}$.\n\nTruesdell rate: $(\\sigma^{\\circ}_T)_{11} = \\dot{\\sigma}_{11} - (L\\sigma)_{11} - (\\sigma L^T)_{11} + (\\text{tr}(D))\\sigma_{11}$.\nFor simple shear, $\\text{tr}(D)=0$.\n$(L\\sigma)_{11} = \\sum_k L_{1k}\\sigma_{k1} = L_{11}\\sigma_{11} + L_{12}\\sigma_{21} = (0)(\\sigma_{11}) + (\\dot{\\gamma})(\\sigma_{12}) = \\dot{\\gamma}\\sigma_{12}$.\n$(\\sigma L^T)_{11} = \\sum_k \\sigma_{1k}(L^T)_{k1} = \\sigma_{11}L^T_{11} + \\sigma_{12}L^T_{21} = (\\sigma_{11})(0) + (\\sigma_{12})(\\dot{\\gamma}) = \\dot{\\gamma}\\sigma_{12}$.\nSo, $(\\sigma^{\\circ}_T)_{11} = \\dot{\\sigma}_{11} - \\dot{\\gamma}\\sigma_{12} - \\dot{\\gamma}\\sigma_{12} = \\dot{\\sigma}_{11} - 2\\dot{\\gamma}\\sigma_{12}$.\n\n5) Discussion of Differences\n\nThe three rates provide different expressions for the objective rate of the normal stress component $\\sigma_{11}$:\n$$ (\\sigma^{\\circ})_{11} = \\dot{\\sigma}_{11} - \\dot{\\gamma}\\sigma_{12} $$\n$$ (\\sigma^{\\circ}_{GN})_{11} = \\dot{\\sigma}_{11} - \\left(\\frac{4\\dot{\\gamma}}{4+\\Gamma^2}\\right)\\sigma_{12} $$\n$$ (\\sigma^{\\circ}_T)_{11} = \\dot{\\sigma}_{11} - 2\\dot{\\gamma}\\sigma_{12} $$\nThe differences arise from the different physical or mathematical interpretations of the \"rate of rotation\" used to correct the material time derivative $\\dot{\\sigma}$.\n\nThe Jaumann rate uses the spin $W$, which is a local, instantaneous measure of fluid rotation based on the velocity field. It predicts a coupling between $\\dot{\\sigma}_{11}$ and $\\sigma_{12}$ that is linear in $\\dot{\\gamma}$.\n\nThe Truesdell rate, which is an upper-convected rate for this incompressible flow, predicts a coupling term that is twice as large as that from the Jaumann rate. This stronger coupling is characteristic of models often associated with viscoelastic fluids where stress is convected and stretched by the flow field.\n\nThe Green–Naghdi rate uses the spin $\\Omega$ of the material line elements themselves. The coupling coefficient, $\\frac{4\\dot{\\gamma}}{4+\\Gamma^2}$, depends on the total accumulated shear $\\Gamma$. At the start of deformation ($\\Gamma=0$), the coefficient is $\\dot{\\gamma}$, so $(\\sigma^{\\circ}_{GN})_{11}$ matches $(\\sigma^{\\circ})_{11}$. However, as $\\Gamma \\to \\infty$, the coupling term vanishes. This reflects the physical idea that material fibers align with the shear direction and their rate of rotation approaches zero at large shear, thereby decoupling the normal stress evolution from the shear stress. The choice of objective rate is not a matter of pure mathematics but depends on the physical behavior of the material being modeled.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\dot{\\sigma}_{11} - \\dot{\\gamma}\\sigma_{12}}\n$$", "id": "2666495"}, {"introduction": "Having observed that different objective rates yield distinct results, a crucial question arises: under what physical conditions do they coincide?

A solution will be derived.\n\n### Derivation of the Governing Condition\n\nThe objective is to find the conditions under which $W = \\Omega_{GN}$. We begin by expressing the spatial velocity gradient $L$ in terms of the polar decomposition constituents $R$ and $U$.\n\nStart with the definition of $L$:\n$$L = \\dot{F} F^{-1}$$\nSubstitute $F = R U$:\n$$\\dot{F} = \\frac{d}{dt}(RU) = \\dot{R}U + R\\dot{U}$$\nThe inverse of $F$ is $F^{-1} = (RU)^{-1} = U^{-1}R^{-1}$. Since $R$ is orthogonal, $R^{-1} = R^T$.\n$$L = (\\dot{R}U + R\\dot{U})(U^{-1}R^T) = \\dot{R}UU^{-1}R^T + R\\dot{U}U^{-1}R^T$$\nThis simplifies to:\n$$L = \\dot{R}R^T + R(\\dot{U}U^{-1})R^T$$\nRecognizing the Green-Naghdi spin $\\Omega_{GN} = \\dot{R}R^T$, we have:\n$$L = \\Omega_{GN} + R(\\dot{U}U^{-1})R^T$$\nNow, we find an expression for the spin tensor $W$:\n$$W = \\frac{1}{2}(L - L^T)$$\nFirst, we find $L^T$:\n$$L^T = (\\Omega_{GN} + R(\\dot{U}U^{-1})R^T)^T = \\Omega_{GN}^T + (R(\\dot{U}U^{-1})R^T)^T$$\nThe spin tensor $\\Omega_{GN} = \\dot{R}R^T$ is skew-symmetric. This is proven by differentiating the identity $I = RR^T$:\n$$0 = \\dot{I} = \\dot{R}R^T + R\\dot{R}^T = \\Omega_{GN} + \\Omega_{GN}^T$$\nThus, $\\Omega_{GN}^T = -\\Omega_{GN}$.\nThe second term becomes $(R(\\dot{U}U^{-1})R^T)^T = R (\\dot{U}U^{-1})^T R^T$. Since $U$ and $\\dot{U}$ are symmetric, we have $(U^{-1})^T = U^{-1}$ and $\\dot{U}^T = \\dot{U}$. So, $(\\dot{U}U^{-1})^T = (U^{-1})^T\\dot{U}^T = U^{-1}\\dot{U}$.\n$$L^T = -\\Omega_{GN} + R(U^{-1}\\dot{U})R^T$$\nNow, we substitute $L$ and $L^T$ into the expression for $W$:\n$$W = \\frac{1}{2} \\left[ (\\Omega_{GN} + R(\\dot{U}U^{-1})R^T) - (-\\Omega_{GN} + R(U^{-1}\\dot{U})R^T) \\right]$$\n$$W = \\frac{1}{2} \\left[ 2\\Omega_{GN} + R(\\dot{U}U^{-1} - U^{-1}\\dot{U})R^T \\right]$$\n$$W = \\Omega_{GN} + \\frac{1}{2} R(\\dot{U}U^{-1} - U^{-1}\\dot{U})R^T$$\nThe condition $W = \\Omega_{GN}$ is therefore satisfied if and only if the second term is zero:\n$$\\frac{1}{2} R(\\dot{U}U^{-1} - U^{-1}\\dot{U})R^T = 0$$\nSince $R$ is an invertible transformation, this is equivalent to:\n$$\\dot{U}U^{-1} - U^{-1}\\dot{U} = 0$$\nRight-multiplying by $U$ gives:\n$$\\dot{U} - U^{-1}\\dot{U}U = 0$$\nLeft-multiplying by $U$ gives:\n$$U\\dot{U} - \\dot{U}U = 0$$\nThis is the commutator of $U$ and $\\dot{U}$:\n$$[U, \\dot{U}] = 0$$\nThus, the condition $W = \\Omega_{GN}$ is necessary and sufficient for the right stretch tensor $U$ to commute with its material time derivative $\\dot{U}$. We will now evaluate each option against this condition.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. The right stretch tensor $U$ is constant in time (possibly spatially varying), i.e., $\\dot{U} = 0$.**\nIf $\\dot{U} = 0$ (the zero tensor), the commutator is:\n$$[U, \\dot{U}] = [U, 0] = U \\cdot 0 - 0 \\cdot U = 0$$\nThe condition $[U, \\dot{U}]=0$ is satisfied. Therefore, this is a sufficient condition.\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\n**B. The left Cauchy–Green tensor $B = F F^{T}$ is coaxial with the rate of deformation $D$ at each time, i.e., $[B,D] = B D - D B = 0$.**\nWe must check if this condition implies $[U, \\dot{U}]=0$.\nFirst, express $B$ and $D$ in terms of $U$ and its derivatives.\n$B = FF^T = (RU)(RU)^T = RUU^TR^T = RU^2R^T$ since $U$ is symmetric.\nFor $D = \\frac{1}{2}(L+L^T)$, using our expressions for $L$ and $L^T$:\n$$D = \\frac{1}{2} \\left[ (\\Omega_{GN} + R(\\dot{U}U^{-1})R^T) + (-\\Omega_{GN} + R(U^{-1}\\dot{U})R^T) \\right] = \\frac{1}{2} R (\\dot{U}U^{-1} + U^{-1}\\dot{U}) R^T$$\nThe condition $[B, D] = 0$ becomes:\n$$[RU^2R^T, \\frac{1}{2} R (\\dot{U}U^{-1} + U^{-1}\\dot{U}) R^T] = 0$$\nUsing the identity $[SAS^{-1}, SBS^{-1}] = S[A,B]S^{-1}$ for any invertible tensor $S$, we can pre-multiply by $R^T$ and post-multiply by $R$ to get the equivalent condition:\n$$[U^2, \\frac{1}{2}(\\dot{U}U^{-1} + U^{-1}\\dot{U})] = 0$$\nLet's analyze this in the principal basis of $U$, where $U$ is diagonal with eigenvalues $\\lambda_k > 0$. The components of a tensor $A$ in this basis are $A_{ij}$. Then $[U, \\dot{U}] = 0$ is equivalent to $(\\lambda_i - \\lambda_j)\\dot{U}_{ij}=0$ for all $i,j$.\nThe components of the tensor $D_M = \\frac{1}{2}(\\dot{U}U^{-1} + U^{-1}\\dot{U})$ are $(D_M)_{ij} = \\frac{1}{2}(\\dot{U}_{ij}/\\lambda_j + \\dot{U}_{ij}/\\lambda_i) = \\frac{\\dot{U}_{ij}}{2} \\frac{\\lambda_i+\\lambda_j}{\\lambda_i\\lambda_j}$.\nThe condition $[U^2, D_M]=0$ has components $(\\lambda_i^2 - \\lambda_j^2)(D_M)_{ij}=0$. Substituting $(D_M)_{ij}$:\n$$(\\lambda_i - \\lambda_j)(\\lambda_i + \\lambda_j) \\left( \\frac{\\dot{U}_{ij}}{2} \\frac{\\lambda_i+\\lambda_j}{\\lambda_i\\lambda_j} \\right) = 0$$\nSince $\\lambda_k > 0$, the terms $\\lambda_i+\\lambda_j$ and $\\lambda_i\\lambda_j$ are strictly positive. The condition simplifies to:\n$$(\\lambda_i - \\lambda_j)\\dot{U}_{ij} = 0$$\nThis is precisely the component form of the condition $[U, \\dot{U}]=0$. Thus, $[B, D]=0$ is a necessary and sufficient condition for $[U, \\dot{U}]=0$. Therefore, it is a sufficient condition for $W = \\Omega_{GN}$.\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\n**C. The motion is a homogeneous simple shear at constant shear rate.**\nFor a simple shear with constant rate $k$, the deformation gradient is $F = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & kt & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$.\nThe right Cauchy-Green tensor is $C=F^T F = U^2 = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & kt \\\\ kt & 1+(kt)^2 \\end{pmatrix}$ in the shear plane. The principal directions of $U$ (and $U^2$) are given by the eigenvectors of this matrix. The eigenvectors depend on $kt$, and thus rotate with time. As shown in the general derivation of our governing condition, $[U, \\dot{U}]=0$ is equivalent to the principal directions of $U$ being stationary (unless eigenvalues are equal, which is not the case here). Since the principal directions of $U$ rotate in simple shear, we must have $[U, \\dot{U}] \\neq 0$. Thus $W \\neq \\Omega_{GN}$.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**D. The right stretch is spherical at all times, $U(t) = \\lambda(t) I$ with $\\lambda(t) > 0$.**\nIn this case, $U(t) = \\lambda(t)I$ and $\\dot{U}(t) = \\dot{\\lambda}(t)I$. The identity tensor $I$ commutes with any tensor.\n$$[U, \\dot{U}] = [\\lambda(t)I, \\dot{\\lambda}(t)I] = \\lambda(t)\\dot{\\lambda}(t)[I, I] = \\lambda(t)\\dot{\\lambda}(t)(I \\cdot I - I \\cdot I) = 0$$\nThe condition $[U, \\dot{U}]=0$ is satisfied. This is a sufficient condition.\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\n**E. The spatial spin vanishes identically, $W(t) = 0$.**\nThis condition states that the motion is irrotational. We need to check if $W=0$ implies $W=\\Omega_{GN}$. This simplifies to checking if $W=0$ implies $\\Omega_{GN}=0$.\nFrom our general expression $W = \\Omega_{GN} + \\frac{1}{2} R(\\dot{U}U^{-1} - U^{-1}\\dot{U})R^T$, setting $W=0$ gives:\n$$\\Omega_{GN} = -\\frac{1}{2} R(\\dot{U}U^{-1} - U^{-1}\\dot{U})R^T = \\frac{1}{2} R(U^{-1}\\dot{U} - \\dot{U}U^{-1})R^T$$\nFor $\\Omega_{GN}$ to be zero, we require $U^{-1}\\dot{U} - \\dot{U}U^{-1} = 0$, which is equivalent to $[U, \\dot{U}]=0$. So, the question reduces to: Does $W=0$ imply $[U, \\dot{U}]=0$?\nThe answer is no. It is possible to construct an irrotational flow ($W=0$) where the principal axes of the right stretch tensor $U$ rotate. For example, consider a flow where the rate of deformation tensor $D$ has principal axes that rotate in space. If we set $L=D$ (so $W=0$), the resulting strain field, characterized by $U$, will generally feature rotating principal axes. If the principal axes of $U$ rotate, then $[U, \\dot{U}] \\neq 0$. In this case, $\\Omega_{GN}$ would be non-zero, meaning $W=0 \\neq \\Omega_{GN}$. Therefore, $W(t)=0$ is not a sufficient condition.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**F. The principal directions of $U$ are time-invariant, equivalently $[U,\\dot{U}] = U \\dot{U} - \\dot{U} U = 0$ at each time.**\nThe problem statement itself provides the equivalence that time-invariant principal directions of $U$ correspond to the condition $[U,\\dot{U}]=0$. Our initial derivation established that $[U, \\dot{U}]=0$ is the necessary and sufficient condition for $W=\\Omega_{GN}$. Therefore, this statement is by definition a sufficient condition.\n**Verdict: Correct**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{ABDF}$$", "id": "2666491"}, {"introduction": "In this capstone practice, theory is put to the test within the framework of constitutive modeling.

Substituting equation (B) into this result yields a single second-order ODE for $\\sigma_{xx}$:\n$$ \\ddot{\\sigma}_{xx} = \\dot{\\gamma}(G\\dot{\\gamma} - \\dot{\\gamma}\\sigma_{xx}) = G\\dot{\\gamma}^2 - \\dot{\\gamma}^2\\sigma_{xx} $$\n$$ \\ddot{\\sigma}_{xx} + \\dot{\\gamma}^2\\sigma_{xx} = G\\dot{\\gamma}^2 $$\nThis is a standard non-homogeneous second-order linear ODE with constant coefficients. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution $\\sigma_{xx,h}$ and a particular solution $\\sigma_{xx,p}$.\nThe homogeneous equation is $\\ddot{\\sigma}_{xx} + \\dot{\\gamma}^2\\sigma_{xx} = 0$, with general solution $\\sigma_{xx,h}(t) = C_1 \\cos(\\dot{\\gamma}t) + C_2 \\sin(\\dot{\\gamma}t)$.\nFor the particular solution, we try a constant $\\sigma_{xx,p} = K$. Substituting into the ODE gives $\\dot{\\gamma}^2 K = G\\dot{\\gamma}^2$, which implies $K=G$.\nThe complete general solution for $\\sigma_{xx}(t)$ is:\n$$ \\sigma_{xx}(t) = C_1 \\cos(\\dot{\\gamma}t) + C_2 \\sin(\\dot{\\gamma}t) + G $$\nWe determine the constants $C_1$ and $C_2$ from the initial conditions $\\sigma_{xx}(0)=0$ and $\\sigma_{xy}(0)=0$.\nFrom $\\sigma_{xx}(0)=0$:\n$$ \\sigma_{xx}(0) = C_1 \\cos(0) + C_2 \\sin(0) + G = C_1 + G = 0 \\implies C_1 = -G $$\nFrom equation (A), $\\dot{\\sigma}_{xx}(0) = \\dot{\\gamma}\\sigma_{xy}(0) = 0$.
