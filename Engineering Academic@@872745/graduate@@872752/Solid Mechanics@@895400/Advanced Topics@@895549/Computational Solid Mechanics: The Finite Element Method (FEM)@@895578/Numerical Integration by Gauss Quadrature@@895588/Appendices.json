The $1$-point Gauss-Legendre rule integrates polynomials of degree up to $2n-1 = 2(1)-1=1$ exactly.

The $2$-point rule integrates polynomials of degree up to $2n-1 = 2(2)-1=3$ exactly. Since the integrand's degree is $0$, and $0 \\le 3$, the $2$-point rule also provides the exact result.\n\nConclusion: Both the $1$-point and $2$-point Gaussian quadrature rules yield the exact value for the stiffness coefficient, $k_e = \\frac{EA}{L}$.

The only remaining unconstrained degree-of-freedom is $d_2$. The single-degree-of-freedom (SDOF) system is governed by the $(2,2)$ components of the mass and stiffness matrices.\nThe reduced scalar stiffness is $k = K^e_{22} = \\frac{EA}{L}$.\nFor the consistent mass case, the reduced scalar mass is $m_{cons} = M^e_{cons, 22} = \\frac{2\\rho A L}{6} = \\frac{\\rho A L}{3}$.\nFor the lumped mass case, the reduced scalar mass is $m_{lump} = M^e_{lump, 22} = \\frac{\\rho A L}{2}$.\n\n4. Eigenfrequency Ratio Calculation\n\nThe equation of motion for the SDOF system is $m\\ddot{d}_2 + k d_2 = 0$. The circular eigenfrequency is $\\omega = \\sqrt{k/m}$.\nFor the consistent mass model:\n$$\\omega_{cons} = \\sqrt{\\frac{k}{m_{cons}}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{EA/L}{\\rho A L/3}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{3E}{\\rho L^2}}$$\nFor the lumped mass model:\n$$\\omega_{lump} = \\sqrt{\\frac{k}{m_{lump}}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{EA/L}{\\rho A L/2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{2E}{\\rho L^2}}$$\nThe required ratio of the lumped-mass eigenfrequency to the consistent-mass eigenfrequency is:\n$$ \\frac{\\omega_{lump}}{\\omega_{cons}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{\\frac{2E}{\\rho L^2}}}{\\sqrt{\\frac{3E}{\\rho L^2}}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{2}{3}} $$\nThis is the final, simplified exact expression.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\sqrt{\\frac{2}{3}}}\n$$", "id": "2665799"}]}
