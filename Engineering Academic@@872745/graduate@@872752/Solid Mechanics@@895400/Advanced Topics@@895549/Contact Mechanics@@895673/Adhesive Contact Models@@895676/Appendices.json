It is scientifically sound, well-posed, objective, and contains no discernible flaws. A solution will be provided.\n\n**Derivation of the Work of Adhesion**\nThe work of adhesion, $w$, is defined as the reversible work required per unit area to separate an interface into two free surfaces. For a reversible, isothermal process, the work done on the system, $W$, is equal to the change in the Helmholtz free energy of the system, $\\Delta F$. The work of adhesion is this work per unit area, $w = \\frac{\\Delta F}{A}$.\n\nWe consider a system with an initial state and a final state.\nThe initial state is the two solids, solid $1$ and solid $2$, in perfect contact, forming an interface of area $A$. The total surface/interfacial free energy of the system in this configuration is due to the interface.\n$$F_{initial} = \\gamma_{12} A$$\nThe final state is the two solids completely separated, exposing two new free surfaces, one of solid $1$ and one of solid $2$, each with area $A$. The interface no longer exists. The total surface free energy of the system in this separated state is the sum of the energies of the two newly created surfaces.\n$$F_{final} = \\gamma_1 A + \\gamma_2 A$$\nThe change in the Helmholtz free energy of the system during this separation process is:\n$$\\Delta F = F_{final} - F_{initial} = (\\gamma_1 A + \\gamma_2 A) - \\gamma_{12} A = (\\gamma_1 + \\gamma_2 - \\gamma_{12})A$$\nThe reversible work per unit area, $w$, required to achieve this separation is therefore:\n$$w = \\frac{\\Delta F}{A} = \\frac{(\\gamma_1 + \\gamma_2 - \\gamma_{12})A}{A}$$\nThis yields the Dupré equation for the work of adhesion:\n$$w = \\gamma_1 + \\gamma_2 - \\gamma_{12}$$\n\n**Numerical Evaluation**\nWe are given the following values for the surface and interfacial energies:\n- $\\gamma_1 = 0.8 \\, \\text{J/m}^2$\n- $\\gamma_2 = 1.2 \\, \\text{J/m}^2$\n- $\\gamma_{12} = 1.5 \\, \\text{J/m}^2$\n\nSubstituting these values into the derived expression for $w$:\n$$w = (0.8 + 1.2 - 1.5) \\, \\text{J/m}^2$$\n$$w = (2.0 - 1.5) \\, \\text{J/m}^2$$\n$$w = 0.5 \\, \\text{J/m}^2$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures.\n$$w = 0.5000 \\, \\text{J/m}^2$$\n\n**Discussion of Physical Interpretation and Implications**\nThe calculated work of adhesion is $w = 0.5000 \\, \\text{J/m}^2$. The sign of $w$ is positive.\n\nA positive work of adhesion ($w > 0$) signifies that the adhered state, where the interface is formed, is energetically more favorable (i.e., has a lower total free energy) than the separated state. Consequently, external energy must be supplied to the system to overcome the attractive forces between the surfaces and separate them. This is the definition of adhesion. If $w$ were negative, the surfaces would repel each other, and the adhered state would be unstable, leading to spontaneous separation.\n\nThe work of adhesion is a critical parameter in continuum models of adhesive contact, such as the JKR and DMT theories, which extend the non-adhesive Hertzian contact theory. These models describe the elastic contact between typically spherical bodies and predict the pull-off force, $F_{pull-off}$, which is the maximum tensile force the contact can sustain before separation.\n\nIn both the JKR model (for soft, compliant materials with large adhesion range) and the DMT model (for stiff materials with small adhesion range), the pull-off force is directly proportional to the work of adhesion, $w$, and the effective radius of curvature, $R$.\n- For the JKR model: $F_{pull-off}^{JKR} = \\frac{3}{2}\\pi R w$\n- For the DMT model: $F_{pull-off}^{DMT} = 2\\pi R w$\n\nThe positive value of $w$ computed here ($w = 0.5000 \\, \\text{J/m}^2$) implies that a finite, non-zero pull-off force is required to separate the two solids. This is the signature of an adhesive contact. A zero or negative work of adhesion would imply a zero pull-off force, reducing the contact behavior to the purely repulsive (non-adhesive) Hertz model. Therefore, the calculated value confirms that the interaction between solid $1$ and solid $2$ is indeed adhesive, and a measurable pull-off phenomenon would be predicted by quantitative contact mechanics theories.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{0.5000}\n$$", "id": "2613428"}, {"introduction": "With the work of adhesion $w$ defined, we can explore how it is incorporated into contact mechanics models. The two canonical limits are the Johnson-Kendall-Roberts (JKR) model for compliant contacts and the Derjaguin-Muller-Toporov (DMT) model for stiff contacts. This practice focuses on the dimensionless Tabor parameter, $\\mu$, a critical tool that compares the scales of elastic deformation and adhesive interaction to determine which regime a given contact falls into [@problem_id:2613368].", "problem": "A rigid sphere of radius $R$ approaches an elastic half-space characterized by the plane-strain reduced modulus $E^*$. The interface is adhesive with work of adhesion $w$ and a finite range of surface forces $z_0$. In adhesive contact mechanics, the transition between the Johnson–Kendall–Roberts (JKR) and Derjaguin–Muller–Toporov (DMT) asymptotic regimes is governed by a single dimensionless parameter that compares the elastic deformation induced at the contact edge by adhesion with the range $z_0$ of the surface forces.\n\nStarting from core definitions and well-tested facts of contact and fracture mechanics (energetic balance at the crack-like contact edge and the existence of a cohesive zone with traction scale set by $w$ and range $z_0$), derive a dimensionally and physically consistent expression for this dimensionless transition parameter $\\mu$ in terms of $R$, $E^*$, $w$, and $z_0$.

This parameter compares the characteristic elastic deformation induced by adhesion at the contact edge to the range $z_0$ of the surface forces.\n\nWe begin from two well-tested facts:\n1. The interfacial traction scale associated with adhesion is set by the ratio of the work of adhesion to the interaction range, so the cohesive traction scale is $\\sigma_0 \\sim w / z_0$.\n2. In linear elastic response, a representative elastic strain scale under surface traction is of the order of $\\sigma_0 / E^*$, with corresponding displacement scales proportional to geometry-dependent lengths.\n\nNear the edge of a spherical contact of radius of curvature $R$, the local gap between the sphere and the plane behaves quadratically with distance $x$ from the edge, i.e., $h(x) \\sim x^2 / R$. The surface force field is effective across a distance $z_0$, so a cohesive (adhesive) zone of extent $x \\sim \\rho$ is expected to satisfy $h(\\rho) \\sim z_0$, giving $\\rho \\sim (R z_0)^{1/2}$. While this geometric estimate identifies a natural outer length scale for adhesive interactions, the elastic singular field at the edge means the actual stress and displacement fields in the cohesive zone must be obtained from a crack-tip balance: the stress intensity from the cohesive tractions cancels the elastic singularity and the energy release rate equals the work of adhesion. In a Dugdale-type cohesive-zone construction consistent with Linear Elastic Fracture Mechanics (LEFM), with cohesive traction $\\sigma_0$ and range $z_0$ such that $w = \\sigma_0 z_0$, this balance leads to a single dimensionless measure of adhesion versus elasticity that can only depend on $R$, $E^*$, $w$, and $z_0$.\n\nBy dimensional analysis (Buckingham $\\Pi$ theorem) using $[R]=\\mathrm{L}$, $[E^*]=\\mathrm{M}\\,\\mathrm{L}^{-1}\\mathrm{T}^{-2}$, $[w]=\\mathrm{M}\\,\\mathrm{T}^{-2}$, and $[z_0]=\\mathrm{L}$, one constructs a unique dimensionless group that is consistent with the LEFM/cohesive-zone balance at the edge and that monotonically increases with increasing curvature radius $R$ and work of adhesion $w$, and decreases with increasing compliance (smaller $E^*$) and larger interaction range $z_0$.

This exercise challenges you to compare the pull-off force in the compliant (JKR), stiff (DMT), and rigid (Bradley) limits, and to explain the underlying physical mechanism. Understanding how elastic compliance allows the system to store and release strain energy is key to grasping why the JKR pull-off force is lower than the DMT value [@problem_id:2613421].", "problem": "A rigid spherical lens of radius $R$ is brought into adhesive contact with a rigid flat in a vacuum. The work of adhesion (energy per unit newly created surface area) between the materials is $w0$. Consider three modeling limits for the normal pull-off force (the most negative load sustainable in quasi-static loading just before catastrophic detachment): (i) a rigid-body limit using the Bradley construction, (ii) the Derjaguin–Muller–Toporov (DMT) limit for short-range forces acting outside a Hertzian elastic contact, and (iii) the Johnson–Kendall–Roberts (JKR) limit in which adhesion acts within the contact and the contact edge is treated as a crack satisfying a Griffith energy balance.\n\nAssume linear elasticity for deformable bodies with effective plane-strain modulus $E^{\\ast}$ when needed, conservative surface forces, axisymmetry, and quasi-static loading under negligible damping. The work of adhesion $w$ is defined as the reversible work per unit area to separate two surfaces from molecular contact to infinite separation. The Bradley construction for rigid bodies may be obtained from the Derjaguin approximation, in which the normal force between curved rigid surfaces is related to the interaction free energy per unit area between parallel plates by a geometrical factor. In energy-based adhesive contact, the crack-like contact edge satisfies a Griffith balance $G=w$ at equilibrium, where $G$ is the energy release rate, and loss of stability at pull-off corresponds to a limit point in the load–configuration response.\n\nWhich option most accurately states the magnitudes of the pull-off forces in the Bradley, DMT, and JKR limits for a sphere of radius $R$ on a flat with work of adhesion $w$, and correctly explains mechanistically why elasticity reduces or enhances the magnitude relative to the rigid-body value?\n\nA. The rigid-body (Bradley) and DMT pull-offs are equal to $2\\pi R w$, while the JKR pull-off is $\\tfrac{3}{2}\\pi R w$; the reduction in the JKR limit occurs because elastic deformation screens the edge tractions, lowering the energy release rate so that detachment happens at a smaller external tensile force.\n\nB.

For any finite Tabor parameter, the pull-off remains at the rigid-body value $2\\pi R w$ because elasticity redistributes stresses without altering the net adhesive force at detachment; only the separation at which detachment occurs is affected, not the peak tensile load.", "solution": "The problem statement is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. It poses a standard question in the field of adhesive contact mechanics, relying on established theories (Bradley, DMT, JKR) and definitions ($w$, $E^*$, $R$). All provided information is consistent and sufficient for deriving a solution. The problem is valid.\n\nWe will now derive the pull-off force for each of the three theoretical limits and analyze the underlying physical mechanisms.\n\n1.  **Bradley (Rigid-Body) Limit**\n\nThe Bradley model considers the adhesion between two perfectly rigid bodies. The force is found by integrating the intermolecular pair potentials between all atoms of the two bodies. The Derjaguin approximation provides a powerful simplification, relating the force $F$ between a sphere of radius $R$ and a flat surface to the interaction energy per unit area, $W_{flat}(h)$, between two parallel flat surfaces at separation $h$. The relation is:\n$$F(h) = 2\\pi R W_{flat}(h)$$\nThe work of adhesion, $w$, is defined as the work required to separate two unit areas of surfaces from their equilibrium contact separation $h_{eq}$ to infinity. By convention, the interaction energy at infinite separation is zero, so $w = W_{flat}(\\infty) - W_{flat}(h_{eq}) = -W_{flat}(h_{eq})$. The pull-off force, $F_{pull-off}$, is the maximum attractive (negative) force, which occurs at the equilibrium separation.\n$$F_{Bradley} = \\max(-F(h)) = -F(h_{eq}) = -2\\pi R W_{flat}(h_{eq})$$\nSubstituting $W_{flat}(h_{eq}) = -w$, we obtain the magnitude of the Bradley pull-off force:\n$$F_{Bradley} = 2\\pi R w$$\n\n2.  **DMT (Derjaguin–Muller–Toporov) Limit**\n\nThe DMT model is appropriate for stiff materials (high $E^*$) and long-range adhesive forces. It models the system by superposing two components: the elastic repulsive force, described by Hertz theory, and an adhesive attractive force. A key assumption of the DMT model is that the adhesive forces act outside the mechanical contact area, in the region where the surfaces are separated by a small gap. Furthermore, the surface profile outside the contact zone is assumed to be identical to the non-adhesive Hertzian profile.\n\nThe total force $P$ is the sum of the elastic Hertzian force $P_{elastic}$ and the adhesive force $P_{adhesive}$:\n$$P = P_{elastic} + P_{adhesive}$$\nThe adhesive force is calculated by integrating the surface interactions over the region external to the contact area $a$. This calculation, under the DMT assumptions, yields an adhesive force that is constant and independent of the contact radius $a$:\n$$P_{adhesive} = -2\\pi R w$$\nThe elastic force is the standard Hertzian force for a contact radius $a$: $P_{elastic} = \\frac{K a^3}{R}$, where $K = \\frac{4}{3}E^*$. The total load is:\n$$P(a) = \\frac{Ka^3}{R} - 2\\pi R w$$\nPull-off occurs at the point of instability where the surfaces separate catastrophically. In the DMT model, this happens as the contact area shrinks to zero ($a \\to 0$). In this limit, the elastic contribution vanishes, $P_{elastic} \\to 0$. The pull-off load is thus:\n$$P_{pull-off} = -2\\pi R w$$\nThe magnitude of the DMT pull-off force is:\n$$F_{DMT} = 2\\pi R w$$\nThis is identical to the rigid-body Bradley value. The physical interpretation is that for stiff systems, the elastic deformation is negligible in determining the adhesive interaction, which is dominated by long-range forces acting over a region whose geometry is essentially undeformed.\n\n3.  **JKR (Johnson–Kendall–Roberts) Limit**\n\nThe JKR model is suited for compliant materials (low $E^*$) with short-range adhesive forces. In this model, adhesion is assumed to act only within the area of contact. The effect of adhesion is to create tensile stresses at the edge of the contact, which pull the surfaces together and increase the contact area compared to the Hertzian case for a given load.\n\nThe model is based on an energy balance. The contact edge is treated as a crack tip, and for equilibrium, the energy release rate $G$ associated with an infinitesimal advance of the crack (i.e., shrinkage of the contact area) must be balanced by the work of adhesion $w$. Instability, and thus pull-off, occurs at a limit point in the load-displacement response where this balance can no longer be maintained under quasi-static conditions.\n\nThe derivation from energy minimization leads to the following relationship between the applied load $P$ and the contact radius $a$:\n$$P(a) = \\frac{Ka^3}{R} - \\sqrt{6\\pi K w a^3}$$\nTo find the pull-off force, we must find the minimum value of $P(a)$, which corresponds to the maximum sustainable tensile load. We differentiate $P(a)$ with respect to $a$ and set the result to zero:\n$$\\frac{dP}{da} = \\frac{3Ka^2}{R} - \\frac{3}{2} \\sqrt{6\\pi K w a} = 0$$\nSolving for the contact radius $a$ at pull-off yields:\n$$a_{pull-off}^3 = \\frac{9\\pi^2 w^2 R^2 K}{4 K^2} = \\frac{9 \\pi w R^2}{8 K}$$\nThis expression for $a_{pull-off}^3$ must have a typo in the algebra. Let's re-calculate.\n$$\\frac{3Ka^2}{R} = \\frac{3}{2}\\sqrt{6\\pi K w a} \\implies \\frac{Ka^2}{R} = \\frac{1}{2}\\sqrt{6\\pi K w a^{1/2}} \\implies \\frac{K^2 a^4}{R^2} = \\frac{1}{4} (6\\pi K w a) \\implies a^3 = \\frac{6\\pi K w R^2}{4 K^2} = \\frac{3\\pi w R^2}{2K}$$\nSubstituting this value of $a^3$ back into the expression for $P(a)$:\n$$P_{pull-off} = \\frac{K}{R} \\left( \\frac{3\\pi w R^2}{2K} \\right) - \\sqrt{6\\pi K w \\left( \\frac{3\\pi w R^2}{2K} \\right)}$$\n$$P_{pull-off} = \\frac{3}{2}\\pi R w - \\sqrt{9\\pi^2 w^2 R^2} = \\frac{3}{2}\\pi R w - 3\\pi R w = -\\frac{3}{2}\\pi R w$$\nThe magnitude of the JKR pull-off force is:\n$$F_{JKR} = \\frac{3}{2}\\pi R w = 1.5\\pi R w$$\nThis is smaller than the rigid-body value. The reason is that the material's compliance allows it to store elastic strain energy. This energy is released as the contact area shrinks. Following the Griffith fracture analogy, the strain energy release rate $G$ must equal the work of adhesion $w$ for separation to occur. Because the stored elastic energy contributes to $G$, a smaller contribution is needed from the potential of the external load. Consequently, the external tensile force required to initiate catastrophic separation is lower than in the rigid case.\n\n**Summary of Force Magnitudes:**\n*   Bradley (rigid): $F_{Bradley} = 2\\pi R w$\n*   DMT (stiff elastic): $F_{DMT} = 2\\pi R w$\n*   JKR (compliant elastic): $F_{JKR} = \\frac{3}{2}\\pi R w$\n\nNow we evaluate the given options.\n\n**A.** \"The rigid-body (Bradley) and DMT pull-offs are equal to $2\\pi R w$, while the JKR pull-off is $\\tfrac{3}{2}\\pi R w$; the reduction in the JKR limit occurs because elastic deformation screens the edge tractions, lowering the energy release rate so that detachment happens at a smaller external tensile force.\"\nThe force magnitudes provided are correct. The explanation, however, is incorrect. Elastic compliance does not lower the energy release rate; it contributes to it, allowing the criterion $G=w$ to be met at a lower external force. **Incorrect**.\n\n**B.** \"The DMT pull-off exceeds the rigid-body value due to elastic flattening that increases the area under attractive tractions outside the contact, and the JKR pull-off equals the rigid-body value; thus elasticity does not change pull-off in the JKR limit.\"\nThe claims about force magnitudes are false. $F_{DMT} = F_{Bradley}$, and $F_{JKR}  F_{Bradley}$. **Incorrect**.\n\n**C.** \"The rigid-body pull-off is $\\pi R w$, the DMT pull-off is $2\\pi R w$, and the JKR pull-off is $3\\pi R w$; elasticity always enhances pull-off because it increases the real area of contact.\"\nThe force magnitudes for Bradley and JKR are incorrect. The claim that elasticity always enhances pull-off is also false, as shown by the JKR result. **Incorrect**.\n\n**D.** \"The DMT pull-off equals the rigid-body (Bradley) value $2\\pi R w$ because adhesive tractions act primarily outside the Hertzian contact and are insensitive to elastic compliance at detachment, whereas the JKR pull-off is smaller, $\\tfrac{3}{2}\\pi R w$, because elastic compliance concentrates energy release at the contact edge; the Griffith condition $G=w$ is met at a lower external tensile force when the body can store and release elastic strain energy near the crack-like edge.\"\nThis statement has the correct force magnitudes: $F_{DMT} = F_{Bradley} = 2\\pi R w$ and $F_{JKR} = \\frac{3}{2}\\pi R w$. The explanation for the DMT result is correct; it correctly identifies the model's assumption that adhesive forces act outside the contact and are thus insensitive to compliance at the point of detachment ($a \\to 0$). The explanation for the JKR result is also correct and physically precise. It correctly invokes the Griffith energy balance ($G=w$) and explains that the stored elastic energy contributes to $G$, thus reducing the required external force for detachment. **Correct**.\n\n**E.** \"For any finite Tabor parameter, the pull-off remains at the rigid-body value $2\\pi R w$ because elasticity redistributes stresses without altering the net adhesive force at detachment; only the separation at which detachment occurs is affected, not the peak tensile load.\"\nThis statement is false.
