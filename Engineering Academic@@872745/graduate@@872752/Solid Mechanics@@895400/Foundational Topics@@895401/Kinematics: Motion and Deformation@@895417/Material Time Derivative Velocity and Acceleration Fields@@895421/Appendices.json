The problem is well-posed and scientifically sound, as it is based on fundamental principles of continuum mechanics. We will proceed with a rigorous derivation.\n\nThe material time derivative, also known as the total or substantial derivative, is defined as:\n$$\n\\frac{D\\phi}{Dt} = \\frac{\\partial \\phi}{\\partial t} + v \\cdot \\nabla \\phi\n$$\nHere, $\\frac{\\partial \\phi}{\\partial t}$ is the local rate of change of the field at a fixed spatial point $x$, and $v \\cdot \\nabla \\phi$ is the convective rate of change, which accounts for the change in the field due to the motion of the material particle through a spatially varying field.\n\nWe must compute each term separately.\n\nFirst, we determine the velocity field $v(x,t)$. The motion is given by $x(X,t) = c + Q(t)(X - c)$, where $X$ is the material coordinate of a particle and $x$ is its spatial position at time $t$. The point $c$ is a fixed center of rotation. The velocity of a material particle is the time derivative of its position, holding $X$ constant:\n$$\nv(X,t) = \\dot{x}(X,t) = \\frac{d}{dt} [c + Q(t)(X - c)]\n$$\nSince $c$ is a fixed point, its time derivative is zero. Thus,\n$$\nv(X,t) = \\dot{Q}(t)(X - c)\n$$\nThis expression for velocity is in terms of the material coordinate $X$. To be useful in the material derivative formula, it must be expressed in terms of the spatial coordinate $x$. We rearrange the motion equation to express $(X - c)$ in terms of $(x - c)$. Since $Q(t)$ is an orthogonal tensor, its inverse is its transpose, $Q(t)^{-1} = Q(t)^{T}$.\n$$\nx - c = Q(t)(X - c) \\implies X - c = Q(t)^{T}(x - c)\n$$\nSubstituting this into the velocity expression gives the velocity field in spatial form:\n$$\nv(x,t) = \\dot{Q}(t) [Q(t)^{T}(x - c)] = [\\dot{Q}(t)Q(t)^{T}](x - c)\n$$\nThe term $\\dot{Q}(t)Q(t)^{T}$ is the definition of the angular velocity tensor, $W(t)$. The axial vector of this skew-symmetric tensor is the angular velocity vector $\\omega(t)$, such that $W(t)a = \\omega(t) \\times a$ for any vector $a$. Therefore, the velocity field is:\n$$\nv(x,t) = W(t)(x - c) = \\omega(t) \\times (x - c)\n$$\nThis is the standard expression for the velocity of a point in a body undergoing rigid rotation about a point $c$.\n\nNext, we evaluate the two terms of the material derivative. The scalar field is given as $\\phi(x,t) = f(r)$, where $r = \\|x - c\\|$ and the function $f$ has no explicit time dependence.\n\nThe first term is the partial time derivative, $\\frac{\\partial \\phi}{\\partial t}$. This derivative is taken at a fixed spatial position $x$. Since the function $f$ does not depend explicitly on time $t$, and its argument $r = \\|x - c\\|$ is a function of the spatial coordinate $x$ only, the scalar field $\\phi$ has no explicit time dependence. Therefore:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial \\phi}{\\partial t} = 0\n$$\n\nThe second term is the convective part, $v \\cdot \\nabla \\phi$. We first compute the gradient of the scalar field, $\\nabla \\phi$. Using the chain rule:\n$$\n\\nabla \\phi = \\nabla f(r) = \\frac{df}{dr} \\nabla r = f'(r) \\nabla r\n$$\nThe gradient of $r = \\|x - c\\| = \\sqrt{(x - c) \\cdot (x - c)}$ is:\n$$\n\\nabla r = \\nabla \\left( \\sqrt{(x - c) \\cdot (x - c)} \\right) = \\frac{1}{2r} \\nabla [ (x - c) \\cdot (x - c) ] = \\frac{1}{2r} [2(x-c)] = \\frac{x-c}{r}\n$$\nSo, the gradient of the scalar field is:\n$$\n\\nabla \\phi = f'(r) \\frac{x - c}{\\|x - c\\|}\n$$\nNow, we compute the dot product of the velocity field and the gradient of $\\phi$:\n$$\nv \\cdot \\nabla \\phi = [\\omega(t) \\times (x - c)] \\cdot \\left[ f'(r) \\frac{x - c}{\\|x - c\\|} \\right]\n$$\nThis can be rewritten as:\n$$\nv \\cdot \\nabla \\phi = \\frac{f'(r)}{\\|x - c\\|} \\left( [\\omega(t) \\times (x - c)] \\cdot (x - c) \\right)\n$$\nThe expression $[\\omega(t) \\times (x - c)]$ yields a vector that is, by definition of the cross product, orthogonal to both $\\omega(t)$ and $(x - c)$. The dot product of any vector with a vector orthogonal to it is zero. Specifically, for any two vectors $A$ and $B$, the vector $A \\times B$ is perpendicular to $B$, so $(A \\times B) \\cdot B = 0$. In our case, $A = \\omega(t)$ and $B = (x - c)$. Thus:\n$$\n[\\omega(t) \\times (x - c)] \\cdot (x - c) = 0\n$$\nConsequently, the convective term is zero:\n$$\nv \\cdot \\nabla \\phi = 0\n$$\n\nCombining the two terms, we find the material time derivative:\n$$\n\\frac{D\\phi}{Dt} = \\frac{\\partial \\phi}{\\partial t} + v \\cdot \\nabla \\phi = 0 + 0 = 0\n$$\n\nThe physical interpretation of this result is direct. The material derivative $D\\phi/Dt$ measures the rate of change of $\\phi$ as experienced by a moving material particle. The scalar field $\\phi$ is defined to be a function only of the distance $r$ from the center of rotation $c$. For a rigid rotation about $c$, every material particle maintains a constant distance from $c$. Let $x(X,t)$ be the position of a particle. Its distance from $c$ is $\\|x(X,t) - c\\| = \\|Q(t)(X - c)\\|$. Since $Q(t)$ is an orthogonal tensor, it preserves the norm, so $\\|Q(t)(X - c)\\| = \\|X - c\\|$, which is a constant for a given particle $X$. Since the particle's distance $r$ never changes, and $\\phi$ depends only on $r$, the value of $\\phi$ for that particle is constant throughout the motion. Therefore, its rate of change with time, the material derivative, must be zero.

Then $(\\mathbf{v} \\cdot \\nabla)\\mathbf{v} = -\\omega(t)^2 \\mathbf{x}_{\\perp}$.\n\nCombining the two terms, the acceleration field is:\n$$\n\\mathbf{a}(\\mathbf{x},t) = \\dot{\\omega}(t)(\\mathbf{e}_z \\times \\mathbf{x}) - \\omega(t)^2 \\mathbf{x}_{\\perp}\n$$\nThe instantaneous direction of motion is parallel to $\\mathbf{v} = \\omega(t)(\\mathbf{e}_z \\times \\mathbf{x})$. The first term, $\\dot{\\omega}(t)(\\mathbf{e}_z \\times \\mathbf{x})$, is evidently parallel to the velocity vector and represents the tangential acceleration, responsible for the change in the magnitude of the velocity. The second term, $-\\omega(t)^2 \\mathbf{x}_{\\perp}$, is the centripetal acceleration. It is directed radially inward toward the $z$-axis and is orthogonal to the velocity vector, since $\\mathbf{v} \\cdot \\mathbf{x}_{\\perp} = \\omega(t)(-y,x,0) \\cdot (x,y,0) = \\omega(t)(-yx+xy) = 0$. This component is responsible for the change in the direction of the velocity.\n\n**2) Pathline Analysis**\n\nThe pathline $\\mathbf{x}(t)$ is the solution to $d\\mathbf{x}/dt = \\mathbf{v}(\\mathbf{x},t)$ with $\\mathbf{x}(0)=\\mathbf{x}_0=(x_0,y_0,z_0)$.

Using the initial condition $z(0)=z_0$, we get $z(t)=z_0$ for all $t$. This shows the motion is confined to the plane $z=z_0$.\n\nTo demonstrate that the path is a circle, consider the squared radial distance from the $z$-axis, $R(t)^2 = x(t)^2+y(t)^2$. Its time derivative is:\n$$\n\\frac{d(R^2)}{dt} = \\frac{d(x^2+y^2)}{dt} = 2x\\frac{dx}{dt} + 2y\\frac{dy}{dt} = 2x(-\\omega y) + 2y(\\omega x) = 0\n$$\nSince the derivative is zero, $R(t)^2$ is a constant. Therefore, $R(t)^2 = R(0)^2 = x_0^2+y_0^2$, which is defined as $R_0^2$. Thus, $R(t) = R_0$. The pathline is a circle of radius $R_0$ in the plane $z=z_0$.\n\nTo find the angular position $\\theta(t)$, we use polar coordinates in the $xy$-plane: $x(t) = R_0 \\cos(\\theta(t))$ and $y(t) = R_0 \\sin(\\theta(t))$. Differentiating $x(t)$ with respect to time:\n$$\n\\frac{dx}{dt} = -R_0 \\sin(\\theta(t)) \\frac{d\\theta}{dt}\n$$\nWe also have $\\frac{dx}{dt} = -\\omega(t)y = -\\omega(t)R_0 \\sin(\\theta(t))$. Equating these two expressions for $dx/dt$:\n$$\n-R_0 \\sin(\\theta(t)) \\frac{d\\theta}{dt} = -\\omega(t)R_0 \\sin(\\theta(t))\n$$\nFor $R_0>0$ and for times when $\\sin(\\theta(t)) \\neq 0$, we find $\\frac{d\\theta}{dt} = \\omega(t)$. This relation holds true even when $\\sin(\\theta(t))=0$ by continuity (checking the $dy/dt$ equation confirms this). Integrating this from $0$ to $t$:\n$$\n\\int_{0}^{t} \\frac{d\\theta}{d\\tau} d\\tau = \\int_{0}^{t} \\omega(\\tau) d\\tau \\implies \\theta(t) - \\theta(0) = \\int_{0}^{t} \\omega(\\tau) d\\tau\n$$\nLetting $\\theta_0$ be the initial angle such that $x_0=R_0\\cos\\theta_0$ and $y_0=R_0\\sin\\theta_0$, the angular position is:\n$$\n\\theta(t) = \\theta_0 + \\int_{0}^{t} \\omega(\\tau) d\\tau\n$$\n\n**3) Streamline Analysis**\n\nA streamline at a fixed time $t^{\\ast}$ is a curve $\\mathbf{r}(s) = (x(s), y(s), z(s))$ defined by the differential equation $\\frac{d\\mathbf{r}}{ds} = \\mathbf{v}(\\mathbf{r}(s), t^{\\ast})$. Let $\\omega^{\\ast} = \\omega(t^{\\ast})$, which is a constant with respect to the curve parameter $s$. The component equations are:\n$$\n\\frac{dx}{ds} = -\\omega^{\\ast} y \\\\\n\\frac{dy}{ds} = \\omega^{\\ast} x \\\\\n\\frac{dz}{ds} = 0\n$$\nThese are formally identical to the pathline equations for a constant angular velocity $\\omega^{\\ast}$. The solution is of the same form. From $dz/ds=0$, each streamline lies in a plane $z=\\text{constant}$. The squared radial distance $x^2+y^2$ is also constant along the curve, as shown by:\n$$\n\\frac{d(x^2+y^2)}{ds} = 2x\\frac{dx}{ds} + 2y\\frac{dy}{ds} = 2x(-\\omega^{\\ast} y) + 2y(\\omega^{\\ast} x) = 0\n$$\nTherefore, the streamlines are circles centered on the $z$-axis in planes parallel to the $xy$-plane. The pathlines are also such circles. Consequently, as geometric sets of points, the family of streamlines at any time $t^{\\ast}$ coincides with the family of pathlines.\n\n**4) Curvature and Torsion**\n\nThe pathline is a regular space curve parameterized by time $t$:\n$$\n\\mathbf{x}(t) = (R_0 \\cos(\\theta(t)), R_0 \\sin(\\theta(t)), z_0)\n$$\nwhere $\\dot{\\theta}(t) = \\omega(t)$.

The vector $\\dot{\\mathbf{x}} \\times \\ddot{\\mathbf{x}}$ is purely in the $\\mathbf{e}_z$ direction. The pathline $\\mathbf{x}(t)$ lies entirely in the plane $z=z_0$.

The definition of the material acceleration is the material time derivative of the velocity field:\n$$ \\boldsymbol{a} = \\frac{D\\boldsymbol{v}}{Dt} = \\frac{\\partial \\boldsymbol{v}}{\\partial t} + (\\boldsymbol{v}\\cdot\\nabla)\\boldsymbol{v} $$\nThe local or partial time derivative of $\\boldsymbol{v}$ is:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial \\boldsymbol{v}}{\\partial t} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t}(\\gamma(t)y\\,\\boldsymbol{e}_{1}) = \\dot{\\gamma}(t)y\\,\\boldsymbol{e}_{1} $$\nThe convective term is $(\\boldsymbol{v}\\cdot\\nabla)\\boldsymbol{v}$. The operator $(\\boldsymbol{v}\\cdot\\nabla)$ is:\n$$ \\boldsymbol{v}\\cdot\\nabla = v_1 \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} + v_2 \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y} + v_3 \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z} = (\\gamma y) \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} + (0) \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y} + (0) \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z} = \\gamma y \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} $$\nApplying this operator to $\\boldsymbol{v}$:\n$$ (\\boldsymbol{v}\\cdot\\nabla)\\boldsymbol{v} = \\left(\\gamma y \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}\\right)(\\gamma y\\,\\boldsymbol{e}_{1}) = \\boldsymbol{0} $$\nThis is zero because the velocity field $\\boldsymbol{v}$ does not depend on the spatial coordinate $x$.\nThus, the acceleration field is purely local:\n$$ \\boldsymbol{a}(\\boldsymbol{x},t) = \\dot{\\gamma}(t)y\\,\\boldsymbol{e}_{1} $$\n\nNext, we compute the velocity gradient tensor $\\boldsymbol{L}(\\boldsymbol{x},t)$, defined as $\\boldsymbol{L} = \\nabla\\boldsymbol{v}$. In Cartesian coordinates, its components are $L_{ij} = \\partial v_i / \\partial x_j$, where $(x_1, x_2, x_3) = (x, y, z)$.\nThe only non-zero component derivative is:\n$$ L_{12} = \\frac{\\partial v_1}{\\partial x_2} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}(\\gamma y) = \\gamma(t) $$\nAll other components $L_{ij}$ are zero. The matrix representation of $\\boldsymbol{L}$ is:\n$$ [\\boldsymbol{L}] = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & \\gamma(t) & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} $$\nIn tensor form, $\\boldsymbol{L} = \\gamma(t) \\boldsymbol{e}_1 \\otimes \\boldsymbol{e}_2$.\n\nThe rate-of-deformation tensor $\\boldsymbol{D}$ is the symmetric part of $\\boldsymbol{L}$:\n$$ \\boldsymbol{D} = \\frac{1}{2}(\\boldsymbol{L} + \\boldsymbol{L}^{\\mathsf{T}}) $$\nThe transpose of $\\boldsymbol{L}$ is $[\\boldsymbol{L}]^{\\mathsf{T}} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ \\gamma(t) & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$.\n$$ [\\boldsymbol{D}] = \\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\begin{pmatrix} 0 & \\gamma & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} + \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ \\gamma & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}\\right) = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & \\gamma/2 & 0 \\\\ \\gamma/2 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} $$\n\nThe spin tensor $\\boldsymbol{W}$ is the skew-symmetric part of $\\boldsymbol{L}$:\n$$ \\boldsymbol{W} = \\frac{1}{2}(\\boldsymbol{L} - \\boldsymbol{L}^{\\mathsf{T}}) $$\n$$ [\\boldsymbol{W}] = \\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\begin{pmatrix} 0 & \\gamma & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} - \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ \\gamma & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}\\right) = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & \\gamma/2 & 0 \\\\ -\\gamma/2 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} $$\n\nNext, we calculate the gradient of the acceleration, $\\nabla \\boldsymbol{a}$. The components of this tensor are $(\\nabla \\boldsymbol{a})_{ij} = \\partial a_i / \\partial x_j$. We have $\\boldsymbol{a} = \\dot{\\gamma}y\\,\\boldsymbol{e}_1$, so $a_1 = \\dot{\\gamma}y$, $a_2 = 0$, $a_3 = 0$.\nThe only non-zero partial derivative is:\n$$ (\\nabla \\boldsymbol{a})_{12} = \\frac{\\partial a_1}{\\partial y} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}(\\dot{\\gamma}y) = \\dot{\\gamma}(t) $$\nThe matrix representation of $\\nabla \\boldsymbol{a}$ is:\n$$ [\\nabla\\boldsymbol{a}] = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & \\dot{\\gamma}(t) & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} $$\n\nNow, we must verify the identity $\\nabla \\boldsymbol{a} = \\dot{\\boldsymbol{L}} + \\boldsymbol{L}^2$ by explicitly calculating the right-hand side. The term $\\dot{\\boldsymbol{L}}$ is the material time derivative of $\\boldsymbol{L}$:\n$$ \\dot{\\boldsymbol{L}} = \\frac{D\\boldsymbol{L}}{Dt} = \\frac{\\partial \\boldsymbol{L}}{\\partial t} + (\\boldsymbol{v}\\cdot\\nabla)\\boldsymbol{L} $$\nThe components of $\\boldsymbol{L}$ are $L_{12} = \\gamma(t)$ and all others are zero. These components are functions of time only and do not vary with spatial position. Therefore, the spatial gradient of each component is zero, i.e., $\\partial L_{ij}/\\partial x_k = 0$ for all $i,j,k$. This implies that the convective term is zero:\n$$ (\\boldsymbol{v}\\cdot\\nabla)\\boldsymbol{L} = \\boldsymbol{0} $$\nSo, the material derivative simplifies to the partial time derivative:\n$$ \\dot{\\boldsymbol{L}} = \\frac{\\partial \\boldsymbol{L}}{\\partial t} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t}(\\gamma(t)\\,\\boldsymbol{e}_1 \\otimes \\boldsymbol{e}_2) = \\dot{\\gamma}(t)\\,\\boldsymbol{e}_1 \\otimes \\boldsymbol{e}_2 $$\nThe matrix representation of $\\dot{\\boldsymbol{L}}$ is:\n$$ [\\dot{\\boldsymbol{L}}] = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & \\dot{\\gamma}(t) & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} $$\nThe final term to calculate is $\\boldsymbol{L}^2 = \\boldsymbol{L}\\boldsymbol{L}$. Using matrix multiplication:\n$$ [\\boldsymbol{L}^2] = [\\boldsymbol{L}][\\boldsymbol{L}] = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & \\gamma & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & \\gamma & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} $$\nSo, $\\boldsymbol{L}^2$ is the zero tensor.\nCombining these results, we find the right-hand side of the identity:\n$$ \\dot{\\boldsymbol{L}} + \\boldsymbol{L}^2 = \\dot{\\gamma}(t)\\,\\boldsymbol{e}_1 \\otimes \\boldsymbol{e}_2 + \\boldsymbol{0} = \\dot{\\gamma}(t)\\,\\boldsymbol{e}_1 \\otimes \\boldsymbol{e}_2 $$\nIts matrix is $[\\dot{\\boldsymbol{L}} + \\boldsymbol{L}^2] = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & \\dot{\\gamma} & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$.\nComparing this with our direct calculation of $\\nabla\\boldsymbol{a}$, we see that $[\\nabla\\boldsymbol{a}] = [\\dot{\\boldsymbol{L}} + \\boldsymbol{L}^2]$. The identity is thus explicitly verified for this motion.\n\nThe final task is to compute the Frobenius norm of the tensor $\\nabla \\boldsymbol{a} - \\dot{\\boldsymbol{L}} - \\boldsymbol{L}^2$.\nBased on our verification, this tensor is the zero tensor:\n$$ \\nabla \\boldsymbol{a} - \\dot{\\boldsymbol{L}} - \\boldsymbol{L}^2 = \\boldsymbol{0} $$\nThe Frobenius norm of a tensor $\\boldsymbol{T}$ with components $T_{ij}$ is given by $\\|\\boldsymbol{T}\\|_F = \\sqrt{\\sum_{i,j} |T_{ij}|^2}$. For the zero tensor, all components are $0$, so its Frobenius norm is:\n$$ \\|\\boldsymbol{0}\\|_F = \\sqrt{0^2 + 0^2 + \\dots + 0^2} = 0 $$\nThe units of all terms in the tensor expression $\\nabla \\boldsymbol{a} - \\dot{\\boldsymbol{L}} - \\boldsymbol{L}^2$ are $\\mathrm{s}^{-2}$. Therefore, the resulting norm also has units of $\\mathrm{s}^{-2}$. The numerical value is zero.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{0}\n$$", "id": "2659112"}]}
