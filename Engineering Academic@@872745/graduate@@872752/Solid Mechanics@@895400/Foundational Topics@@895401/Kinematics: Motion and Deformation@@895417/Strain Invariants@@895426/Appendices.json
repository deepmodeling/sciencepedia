The validation of the problem statement has confirmed its scientific soundness and well-posedness. We proceed with the derivation.\n\nThe fundamental relationship between a second-order tensor in three-dimensional space and its principal invariants is expressed through its characteristic equation. For the right Cauchy–Green tensor $\\mathbf{C}$, the eigenvalues $x$ are the roots of the equation $\\det(\\mathbf{C} - x\\mathbf{I}) = 0$, where $\\mathbf{I}$ is the identity tensor. This equation can be written as a cubic polynomial whose coefficients are determined by the principal invariants $(I_{1}, I_{2}, I_{3})$:\n$$x^{3} - I_{1}x^{2} + I_{2}x - I_{3} = 0$$\nThe invariants are defined in terms of the eigenvalues $x_1, x_2, x_3$ of $\\mathbf{C}$ as the elementary symmetric polynomials:\n$$I_{1} = x_{1} + x_{2} + x_{3}$$\n$$I_{2} = x_{1}x_{2} + x_{2}x_{3} + x_{3}x_{1}$$\n$$I_{3} = x_{1}x_{2}x_{3}$$\nThe problem defines the principal stretches $\\lambda_{1}, \\lambda_{2}, \\lambda_{3}$ as the positive square roots of the eigenvalues of $\\mathbf{C}$.

For the given $\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}$:\n$$ j_{1} = \\mathrm{tr}(\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}) = 0 + 0 + 0 = 0 $$\nTherefore, the linearized theory predicts no change in the invariants to first order in strain:\n$I_{1} \\approx 3$, $I_{2} \\approx 3$, $I_{3} \\approx 1$.\n\nLet us compare this with our exact results:\n$\\Delta I_{1} = I_{1} - 3 = \\gamma^{2}$\n$\\Delta I_{2} = I_{2} - 3 = \\gamma^{2}$\n$\\Delta I_{3} = I_{3} - 1 = 0$\nThe exact changes in $I_1$ and $I_2$ are of order $\\gamma^{2}$, while the change in $I_3$ is identically zero. Because the components of $\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}$ are of order $\\gamma$, the changes in invariants are of second order in strain components. The linearized theory result, which predicts zero first-order change, is therefore consistent with the exact calculation. The non-zero terms $\\gamma^2$ are second-order effects, which are neglected in the linearized approximation.\n\nPhysical Interpretation:\nThe infinitesimal strain tensor $\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}$ corresponds to a state of pure shear in the $\\mathbf{e}_1-\\mathbf{e}_2$ plane. The condition $\\mathrm{tr}(\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon})=0$ signifies that, to first order, the deformation is volume-preserving. The invariants $I_1$ and $I_2$ are related to length and area changes, respectively. The prediction $\\Delta I_1 \\approx 0$ and $\\Delta I_2 \\approx 0$ from the linearized theory implies that simple shear, at the infinitesimal level, does not produce extension of line elements aligned with the coordinate axes or change in the area of coordinate planes. The deformation is purely a change in angle between the basis vectors $\\mathbf{e}_1$ and $\\mathbf{e}_2$.\n\nThe exact results show that $I_{1} > 3$ and $I_{2} > 3$ for any non-zero $\\gamma$. This reflects the fact that finite simple shear does cause stretching of certain material fibers (e.g., those oriented along the diagonal direction in the $\\mathbf{e}_1-\\mathbf{e}_2$ plane), a second-order effect captured by the term $\\gamma^2$. The fact that $I_3 = 1$ exactly confirms that the deformation is perfectly isochoric (volume-preserving) for any value of $\\gamma$, not just in the infinitesimal limit. The linearized model correctly captures the lack of first-order effects on volume, length, and area, while the full non-linear theory is required to describe the second-order stretching effects inherent in finite shear.", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{ \\begin{pmatrix} 3 + \\gamma^{2} & 3 + \\gamma^{2} & 1 \\end{pmatrix} } $$", "id": "2689524"}, {"introduction": "The final step in harnessing strain invariants for practical application is to use them in constitutive modeling, where the strain energy is often expressed as a function $W(I_1, I_2, I_3)$.
