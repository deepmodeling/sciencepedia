A principal direction $\\boldsymbol{n}$ is characterized by the property that the stress vector $\\boldsymbol{t} = \\boldsymbol{\\sigma}\\boldsymbol{n}$ is parallel to $\\boldsymbol{n}$. Let an in-plane principal direction be defined by the angle $\\theta_p$ with the $x$-axis, so its components are $n_x = \\cos(\\theta_p)$ and $n_y = \\sin(\\theta_p)$. The eigenvalue equation $(\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}_{2D} - \\sigma_p \\boldsymbol{I}_{2D}) \\boldsymbol{n} = \\boldsymbol{0}$ provides the system of equations:\n$$\n(\\sigma_x - \\sigma_p)\\cos(\\theta_p) + \\tau_{xy}\\sin(\\theta_p) = 0\n$$\n$$\n\\tau_{xy}\\cos(\\theta_p) + (\\sigma_y - \\sigma_p)\\sin(\\theta_p) = 0\n$$\nTo find a relationship for $\\theta_p$ that is independent of $\\sigma_p$, we can substitute an expression for $\\sigma_p$ from the first equation into the second.

The characteristic equation is $\\det(\\boldsymbol{\\sigma} - \\sigma_p \\boldsymbol{I}) = 0$:\n$$\n\\begin{vmatrix}\n\\sigma_x - \\sigma_p & \\tau_{xy} & 0 \\\\\n\\tau_{xy} & \\sigma_y - \\sigma_p & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & -\\sigma_p\n\\end{vmatrix} = 0\n$$\nExpanding the determinant along the third row gives:\n$$\n(-\\sigma_p) \\left| \\begin{matrix} \\sigma_x - \\sigma_p & \\tau_{xy} \\\\ \\tau_{xy} & \\sigma_y - \\sigma_p \\end{matrix} \\right| = 0\n$$\nThis equation is satisfied if either factor is zero.\n1.  $-\\sigma_p = 0$, which gives the principal stress $\\sigma_3 = 0$.\n2.  The determinant is zero, which is precisely the characteristic equation for the in-plane stresses that we already solved. This yields the principal stresses $\\sigma_1$ and $\\sigma_2$.\n\nTherefore, for the three-dimensional plane-stress state, the three principal stresses are the two in-plane principal stresses $\\sigma_1$ and $\\sigma_2$ derived before, and a third principal stress $\\sigma_3 = 0$.\n\nThe principal direction corresponding to $\\sigma_3=0$ is found by solving $(\\boldsymbol{\\sigma} - 0\\cdot\\boldsymbol{I})\\boldsymbol{n}_3 = \\boldsymbol{0}$, or $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}\\boldsymbol{n}_3 = \\boldsymbol{0}$. Let $\\boldsymbol{n}_3 = (n_x, n_y, n_z)^T$.\n$$\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n\\sigma_x & \\tau_{xy} & 0 \\\\\n\\tau_{xy} & \\sigma_y & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 0\n\\end{pmatrix}\n\\begin{pmatrix} n_x \\\\ n_y \\\\ n_z \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThis gives the system $\\sigma_x n_x + \\tau_{xy} n_y = 0$ and $\\tau_{xy} n_x + \\sigma_y n_y = 0$. Unless the determinant $\\sigma_x\\sigma_y - \\tau_{xy}^2$ is zero (which means one of the in-plane principal stresses is also zero), the only solution is $n_x=0$ and $n_y=0$. The third equation $0 \\cdot n_z = 0$ is always satisfied, so $n_z$ can be any non-zero value. Normalizing the eigenvector gives $\\boldsymbol{n}_3 = (0, 0, 1)^T$, which is the direction of the $z$-axis, $\\boldsymbol{e}_z$.\n\nIn summary, the 3D analysis confirms that the in-plane principal stresses $\\sigma_1, \\sigma_2$ and their directions (which lie in the $xy$-plane) are two of the three principal values. The third principal stress is $\\sigma_3=0$, and its principal direction is normal to the plane of analysis, i.e., the $z$-direction.\n\nThe problem asks for the maximum principal stress, $\\sigma_{\\max}$. This is the algebraically largest of the three principal stresses: $\\sigma_{\\max} = \\max(\\sigma_1, \\sigma_2, \\sigma_3)$.\nBy definition, $\\sigma_1$ is the larger root from the quadratic formula (with the plus sign), so $\\sigma_1 \\ge \\sigma_2$. The three principal stresses are:\n$$\n\\sigma_1 = \\frac{\\sigma_x + \\sigma_y}{2} + \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{\\sigma_x - \\sigma_y}{2}\\right)^{2} + \\tau_{xy}^{2}}\n$$\n$$\n\\sigma_2 = \\frac{\\sigma_x + \\sigma_y}{2} - \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{\\sigma_x - \\sigma_y}{2}\\right)^{2} + \\tau_{xy}^{2}}\n$$\n$$\n\\sigma_3 = 0\n$$\nThe maximum principal stress is therefore $\\sigma_{\\max} = \\max(\\sigma_1, \\sigma_3) = \\max(\\sigma_1, 0)$. In many engineering contexts, particularly under tensile-dominant loading, $\\sigma_1$ is positive and is therefore the maximum. However, if the in-plane state is entirely compressive (e.g., biaxial compression), $\\sigma_1$ can be negative, in which case the maximum principal stress is $\\sigma_3=0$. The problem asks for a single expression for $\\sigma_{\\max}$. While an expression involving a max function or absolute value could be constructed to be formally correct in all cases, the term \"maximum principal stress\" in this context conventionally refers to the expression for $\\sigma_1$, the more tensile of the in-plane stresses. We will adhere to this widespread convention for the final answer.\nThus, the expression for the maximum principal stress is taken to be the expression for $\\sigma_1$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\frac{\\sigma_x + \\sigma_y}{2} + \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{\\sigma_x - \\sigma_y}{2}\\right)^{2} + \\tau_{xy}^{2}}}\n$$", "id": "2674861"}, {"introduction": "This final practice explores the important and conceptually rich topic of degenerate stress states, where principal stresses are not all distinct.

The eigenvalue problem is given by $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}\\boldsymbol{n} = \\lambda\\boldsymbol{n}$, where $\\lambda$ is a principal stress and $\\boldsymbol{n}$ is the corresponding principal direction. In matrix form, this is $([\\sigma] - \\lambda[I])[\\boldsymbol{n}] = \\boldsymbol{0}$. The principal stresses are the roots of the characteristic equation $\\det([\\sigma] - \\lambda[I]) = 0$.\n$$ \\det \\begin{pmatrix} \\sigma_0 - \\lambda & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & \\sigma_0 - \\lambda & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & -\\lambda \\end{pmatrix} = 0 $$\n$$ (\\sigma_0 - \\lambda)(\\sigma_0 - \\lambda)(-\\lambda) = 0 $$\n$$ -\\lambda(\\sigma_0 - \\lambda)^2 = 0 $$\nThe roots of this equation, which are the principal stresses, are $\\lambda = \\sigma_0$ (with algebraic multiplicity $2$) and $\\lambda = 0$. By convention, we order them as $\\sigma_1 \\ge \\sigma_2 \\ge \\sigma_3$.\nThus, the principal stresses are:\n$$ \\sigma_1 = \\sigma_0, \\quad \\sigma_2 = \\sigma_0, \\quad \\sigma_3 = 0 $$\n\nTo find the principal directions, we find the eigenvectors for each distinct eigenvalue.\n\nFor the principal stress $\\sigma_3 = 0$:\n$$ ([\\sigma] - 0[I])[\\boldsymbol{n}^{(3)}] = \\boldsymbol{0} $$\n$$ \\begin{pmatrix} \\sigma_0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & \\sigma_0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} n_1 \\\\ n_2 \\\\ n_3 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix} $$\nThis system of equations yields $\\sigma_0 n_1 = 0$ and $\\sigma_0 n_2 = 0$. Since $\\sigma_0 > 0$, we must have $n_1=0$ and $n_2=0$. The component $n_3$ is arbitrary. The normalized eigenvector, or principal direction, is therefore $\\boldsymbol{n}^{(3)} = \\boldsymbol{e}_3$.\n\nFor the repeated principal stress $\\sigma_1 = \\sigma_2 = \\sigma_0$:\n$$ ([\\sigma] - \\sigma_0[I])[\\boldsymbol{n}] = \\boldsymbol{0} $$\n$$ \\begin{pmatrix} \\sigma_0 - \\sigma_0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & \\sigma_0 - \\sigma_0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 - \\sigma_0 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} n_1 \\\\ n_2 \\\\ n_3 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix} $$\n$$ \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & -\\sigma_0 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} n_1 \\\\ n_2 \\\\ n_3 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix} $$\nThis gives a single equation, $-\\sigma_0 n_3 = 0$, which implies $n_3=0$. The components $n_1$ and $n_2$ are unconstrained. Any vector of the form $\\boldsymbol{n} = n_1\\boldsymbol{e}_1 + n_2\\boldsymbol{e}_2$ is an eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue $\\sigma_0$.\n\nThe degeneracy in the principal directions arises because the eigenvalue $\\sigma_0$ has a geometric multiplicity of $2$, matching its algebraic multiplicity. The eigenvalue problem does not uniquely specify a direction; instead, it defines a two-dimensional subspace of eigenvectors, known as an eigenspace. This eigenspace is the principal subspace associated with the principal stress $\\sigma_0$. It is characterized as the set of all vectors orthogonal to $\\boldsymbol{n}^{(3)} = \\boldsymbol{e}_3$. This is precisely the plane spanned by the basis vectors $\\boldsymbol{e}_1$ and $\\boldsymbol{e}_2$. Therefore, any direction lying within the $\\boldsymbol{e}_1\\boldsymbol{e}_2$-plane is a principal direction corresponding to the principal stress $\\sigma_0$. The physical meaning is a state of equibiaxial tension in the plane.\n\nPart 2: Deviatoric Stress and Second Invariant $J_2$\n\nThe deviatoric stress tensor $\\boldsymbol{s}$ is defined by $\\boldsymbol{s}=\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}-\\tfrac{1}{3}I_1\\,\\boldsymbol{I}$.\nFirst, we compute the first invariant of stress, $I_1 = \\operatorname{tr}(\\boldsymbol{\\sigma})$.\n$$ I_1 = \\operatorname{tr}([\\sigma]) = \\sigma_0 + \\sigma_0 + 0 = 2\\sigma_0 $$\nAlternatively, $I_1$ is the sum of the principal stresses: $I_1 = \\sigma_1 + \\sigma_2 + \\sigma_3 = \\sigma_0 + \\sigma_0 + 0 = 2\\sigma_0$.\n\nThe hydrostatic part of the stress is $\\frac{1}{3}I_1\\boldsymbol{I}$, which has the matrix representation:\n$$ [\\sigma_m] = \\frac{1}{3}I_1[I] = \\frac{2\\sigma_0}{3} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{2}{3}\\sigma_0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & \\frac{2}{3}\\sigma_0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & \\frac{2}{3}\\sigma_0 \\end{pmatrix} $$\nThe deviatoric stress tensor is then:\n$$ [s] = [\\sigma] - [\\sigma_m] = \\begin{pmatrix} \\sigma_0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & \\sigma_0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} - \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{2}{3}\\sigma_0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & \\frac{2}{3}\\sigma_0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & \\frac{2}{3}\\sigma_0 \\end{pmatrix} $$\n$$ [s] = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{1}{3}\\sigma_0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & \\frac{1}{3}\\sigma_0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & -\\frac{2}{3}\\sigma_0 \\end{pmatrix} $$\nThe second invariant of the deviatoric stress tensor, $J_2$, is defined as $J_2=\\tfrac{1}{2}\\boldsymbol{s}:\\boldsymbol{s}$. The double dot product $\\boldsymbol{s}:\\boldsymbol{s}$ is the sum of the squares of the tensor components, $s_{ij}s_{ij}$.\n$$ \\boldsymbol{s}:\\boldsymbol{s} = s_{11}^2 + s_{22}^2 + s_{33}^2 = \\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\sigma_0\\right)^2 + \\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\sigma_0\\right)^2 + \\left(-\\frac{2}{3}\\sigma_0\\right)^2 $$\n$$ \\boldsymbol{s}:\\boldsymbol{s} = \\frac{1}{9}\\sigma_0^2 + \\frac{1}{9}\\sigma_0^2 + \\frac{4}{9}\\sigma_0^2 = \\frac{6}{9}\\sigma_0^2 = \\frac{2}{3}\\sigma_0^2 $$\nTherefore, $J_2$ is:\n$$ J_2 = \\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\frac{2}{3}\\sigma_0^2\\right) = \\frac{1}{3}\\sigma_0^2 $$\n\nAs a verification, $J_2$ can also be computed from the principal stresses:\n$$ J_2 = \\frac{1}{6}\\left[ (\\sigma_1-\\sigma_2)^2 + (\\sigma_2-\\sigma_3)^2 + (\\sigma_3-\\sigma_1)^2 \\right] $$\nSubstituting $\\sigma_1 = \\sigma_0$, $\\sigma_2 = \\sigma_0$, and $\\sigma_3 = 0$:\n$$ J_2 = \\frac{1}{6}\\left[ (\\sigma_0-\\sigma_0)^2 + (\\sigma_0-0)^2 + (0-\\sigma_0)^2 \\right] $$\n$$ J_2 = \\frac{1}{6}\\left[ 0^2 + \\sigma_0^2 + (-\\sigma_0)^2 \\right] = \\frac{1}{6}(2\\sigma_0^2) = \\frac{1}{3}\\sigma_0^2 $$\nThe results are consistent. The quantity $J_2$ has units of stress squared, which would be $\\text{Pa}^2$ if $\\sigma_0$ is in Pascals.\nThe final value is derived.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{1}{3}\\sigma_0^2}$$", "id": "2674890"}]}
