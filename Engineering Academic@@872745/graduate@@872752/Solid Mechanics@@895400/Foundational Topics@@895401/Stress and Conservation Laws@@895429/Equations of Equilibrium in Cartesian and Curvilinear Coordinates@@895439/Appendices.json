The problem concerns a long cylinder far from the ends, which, by Saint-Venant's principle, implies the stress state is also independent of the axial coordinate $z$, so $\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z} (\\cdot) = 0$.\n\nApplying these conditions to the equilibrium equations:\nThe $\\theta$-equation simplifies to $\\frac{\\partial \\sigma_{r\\theta}}{\\partial r} + \\frac{2\\sigma_{r\\theta}}{r} = 0$. This can be rewritten as $\\frac{1}{r^2} \\frac{d}{dr}(r^2 \\sigma_{r\\theta}) = 0$. Integrating gives $r^2 \\sigma_{r\\theta} = C_1$, where $C_1$ is a constant. Since the tractions on the inner and outer surfaces are purely normal pressures, the shear stress $\\sigma_{r\\theta}$ must be zero at $r=r_i$ and $r=r_o$. This requires $C_1 = 0$, so $\\sigma_{r\\theta} = 0$ everywhere. Similarly, axisymmetry would imply $\\sigma_{\\theta z}=0$.\n\nThe $z$-equation simplifies to $\\frac{d \\sigma_{rz}}{dr} + \\frac{\\sigma_{rz}}{r} = 0$. This can be rewritten as $\\frac{1}{r}\\frac{d}{dr}(r \\sigma_{rz}) = 0$. Integrating gives $r \\sigma_{rz} = C_2$. The boundary conditions are that the surfaces $r=r_i$ and $r=r_o$ are subjected to pressure loading only, meaning there are no shear tractions. Thus, $\\sigma_{rz}(r_i) = 0$ and $\\sigma_{rz}(r_o) = 0$. Either condition suffices to show that $C_2 = 0$, and therefore $\\sigma_{rz} = 0$ everywhere. This addresses the suppression of the $\\sigma_{rz}$ component.\n\nThe only remaining nontrivial equilibrium equation is the $r$-component, which becomes the governing differential equation for radial balance:\n$$ \\frac{d \\sigma_{rr}}{dr} + \\frac{\\sigma_{rr} - \\sigma_{\\theta\\theta}}{r} = 0 $$\n\n2) Solution for radial and hoop stresses.\nThe radial equilibrium equation is a single equation with two unknown functions, $\\sigma_{rr}(r)$ and $\\sigma_{\\theta\\theta}(r)$. The problem is statically indeterminate. To solve it, we must introduce further relations from elasticity theory. The strain-displacement relations for the axisymmetric case are $\\epsilon_{rr} = \\frac{du_r}{dr}$ and $\\epsilon_{\\theta\\theta} = \\frac{u_r}{r}$, where $u_r$ is the radial displacement. These lead to a compatibility equation: $\\frac{d}{dr}(r\\epsilon_{\\theta\\theta}) = \\epsilon_{rr}$.\nFor a general plane problem with no body forces, the compatibility of strains requires that $\\nabla^2(\\sigma_{rr} + \\sigma_{\\theta\\theta}) = 0$. For the present axisymmetric case, this simplifies to $\\frac{1}{r}\\frac{d}{dr}\\left(r\\frac{d}{dr}(\\sigma_{rr} + \\sigma_{\\theta\\theta})\\right) = 0$. Integrating twice gives $\\sigma_{rr} + \\sigma_{\\theta\\theta} = C_1\\ln(r) + 2A$. For the displacement field to be single-valued in a hollow cylinder, the logarithmic term must be absent, so $C_1=0$. Thus, $\\sigma_{rr} + \\sigma_{\\theta\\theta} = 2A$, where $A$ is a constant.\n\nWe now have a system of two equations:\n(i) $\\sigma_{\\theta\\theta} - \\sigma_{rr} = r \\frac{d\\sigma_{rr}}{dr}$ (from equilibrium)\n(ii) $\\sigma_{\\theta\\theta} + \\sigma_{rr} = 2A$ (from compatibility)\nAdding (i) and (ii): $2\\sigma_{\\theta\\theta} = 2A + r \\frac{d\\sigma_{rr}}{dr}$.\nSubtracting (i) from (ii): $2\\sigma_{rr} = 2A - r \\frac{d\\sigma_{rr}}{dr}$, which gives $r\\frac{d\\sigma_{rr}}{dr} + 2\\sigma_{rr} = 2A$. This is a first-order linear ordinary differential equation for $\\sigma_{rr}$. Multiplying by an integrating factor of $r$ gives $r^2\\frac{d\\sigma_{rr}}{dr} + 2r\\sigma_{rr} = 2Ar$, which is $\\frac{d}{dr}(r^2\\sigma_{rr}) = 2Ar$. Integrating with respect to $r$ yields $r^2\\sigma_{rr} = Ar^2 - B$, where $-B$ is the constant of integration.\nThe general solution for the radial stress is thus:\n$$ \\sigma_{rr}(r) = A - \\frac{B}{r^2} $$\nSubstituting this into $\\sigma_{\\theta\\theta} = 2A - \\sigma_{rr}$ gives the hoop stress:\n$$ \\sigma_{\\theta\\theta}(r) = A + \\frac{B}{r^2} $$\nThese are the well-known Lamé equations. The constants $A$ and $B$ are determined from the boundary conditions on tractions. The pressure $p$ corresponds to a compressive normal stress, so $\\sigma_{rr} = -p$.\nAt $r=r_i$, $\\sigma_{rr}(r_i) = -p_i \\implies A - \\frac{B}{r_i^2} = -p_i$.\nAt $r=r_o$, $\\sigma_{rr}(r_o) = -p_o \\implies A - \\frac{B}{r_o^2} = -p_o$.\nThis is a linear system for $A$ and $B$. Subtracting the second equation from the first yields $B\\left(\\frac{1}{r_o^2} - \\frac{1}{r_i^2}\\right) = p_o - p_i$, which gives $B = \\frac{(p_i - p_o)r_i^2 r_o^2}{r_o^2 - r_i^2}$.\nSubstituting $B$ back into the second equation gives $A = -p_o + \\frac{B}{r_o^2} = -p_o + \\frac{(p_i - p_o)r_i^2}{r_o^2 - r_i^2} = \\frac{-p_o(r_o^2-r_i^2) + p_i r_i^2 - p_o r_i^2}{r_o^2 - r_i^2}$, which simplifies to $A = \\frac{p_i r_i^2 - p_o r_o^2}{r_o^2 - r_i^2}$.\n\n3) Determination of axial stress $\\sigma_{zz}$ from global equilibrium.\nFor this part, we must use only equilibrium principles as instructed. We consider a free-body diagram of a portion of the cylinder, including one of the closed ends, cut by a plane at $z=\\text{constant}$ far from the ends. Let the $z$-axis be the axis of the cylinder. The net force in the $z$-direction on this free body must be zero.\nThe forces acting in the $z$-direction are:\ni) The force exerted by the internal pressure $p_i$ on the inner face of the end cap. This force is $F_{p_i} = p_i \\cdot (\\pi r_i^2)$.\nii) The force exerted by the external pressure $p_o$ on the outer face of the end cap. This force is $F_{p_o} = -p_o \\cdot (\\pi r_o^2)$.\niii) The force resulting from the axial stress $\\sigma_{zz}$ acting on the annular cross-section of the pipe at the cut. As we are far from the ends, $\\sigma_{zz}$ is uniform over the cross-section. The area of the cross-section is $\\pi(r_o^2 - r_i^2)$. This force is $F_{\\sigma_z} = -\\sigma_{zz} \\cdot \\pi(r_o^2 - r_i^2)$, where the negative sign indicates it opposes the pressure forces for a tensile $\\sigma_{zz}$.\n\nThe condition for static equilibrium in the $z$-direction is $\\sum F_z = 0$:\n$$ p_i \\pi r_i^2 - p_o \\pi r_o^2 - \\sigma_{zz} \\pi(r_o^2 - r_i^2) = 0 $$\nWe can cancel the common factor of $\\pi$ and solve for $\\sigma_{zz}$:\n$$ \\sigma_{zz} (r_o^2 - r_i^2) = p_i r_i^2 - p_o r_o^2 $$\nThis gives the uniform axial stress:\n$$ \\sigma_{zz} = \\frac{p_i r_i^2 - p_o r_o^2}{r_o^2 - r_i^2} $$\nIt is noteworthy that this expression for $\\sigma_{zz}$ is identical to the constant $A$ derived in Part 2.

To express this in curvilinear coordinates, we use tensor components and the covariant derivative.\n\nThe proposed procedure in option A is as follows:\n(1) Compute scale factors $h_i = \\sqrt{g_{ii}}$. This is a correct first step to characterize the geometry of the coordinate system.\n(2) Form Christoffel symbols using simplified formulas for orthogonal coordinates. These formulas are correct and streamline the calculation, as demonstrated by the sample calculations above.\n(3) Choose a tensor representation (e.g., contravariant $\\sigma^{ij}$, mixed $\\sigma^{i}{}_j$, or physical components). This choice determines the specific form of the divergence operator but does not change the physics. This is a necessary and correct step.\n(4) Write the covariant divergence. The equation for the contravariant components, $(\\nabla\\cdot\\boldsymbol{\\sigma})^i = \\sigma^{ij}{}_{;j} = \\dfrac{\\partial\\sigma^{ij}}{\\partial q^{j}}+\\Gamma^{i}{}_{kj}\\sigma^{kj}+\\Gamma^{j}{}_{kj}\\sigma^{ik}$, is the standard and correct expression for the divergence of a symmetric second-rank tensor field.

This final step involves substituting the calculated Christoffel symbols and the stress/body force components into the divergence formula for each value of $i=1,2,3$ to yield the three scalar equilibrium equations. This is the correct conclusion of the procedure.\n\nThe entire procedure is logically sound and mathematically correct.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\nA) The list of nonzero Christoffel symbols is correct, as verified by direct calculation. The five-step procedure to derive the equilibrium equations is methodologically sound and uses correct tensor calculus formulas.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\nB) The list of Christoffel symbols is incorrect. For example, it lists $\\Gamma^{\\mu}{}_{\\mu\\nu}=+\\dfrac{\\nu}{\\mu^{2}-\\nu^{2}}$, while the correct sign is negative. The proposed procedure, which omits the connection terms (Christoffel symbols) from the divergence operator, is fundamentally incorrect. The divergence of a tensor in curvilinear coordinates is not the partial derivative of its components.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\nC) The list of Christoffel symbols is incorrect. It falsely claims that symbols with mixed lower indices, like $\\Gamma^{\\mu}{}_{\\mu\\nu}$, are zero. The proposed procedure involves an arbitrary and unjustified approximation of the covariant divergence, which is not a valid simplification.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\nD) The premise that all Christoffel symbols with a $\\phi$ index vanish because the metric is independent of $\\phi$ is false. As shown in the derivation, symbols like $\\Gamma^{\\phi}{}_{\\mu\\phi}$, $\\Gamma^{\\mu}{}_{\\phi\\phi}$, and $\\Gamma^{\\nu}{}_{\\phi\\phi}$ are nonzero. The procedural recommendation to use a Euclidean divergence formula is also fundamentally incorrect, as it ignores the curvature of the coordinate system.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\nBased on this analysis, only option A provides both the correct Christoffel symbols and the correct methodology.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2636644"}]}
