{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "The Kronecker delta, $\\delta_{ij}$, is more than just a notational convenience; it's an operator that performs index substitution. This exercise focuses on its most fundamental role: the \"sifting property,\" where contracting a tensor with $\\delta_{ij}$ effectively renames an index. Mastering this manipulation is the first step toward fluency in tensor algebra, allowing for the simplification of complex expressions that arise in fields like solid mechanics. [@problem_id:2654067]", "problem": "In linearized solid mechanics, fourth-order tensors arise naturally, for example as material stiffness tensors mapping second-order strain to second-order stress. Work in a Cartesian basis and adopt the Einstein summation convention (ESC), where any index that appears exactly twice in a single term is understood to be summed over its full range. Consider a generic fourth-order tensor $T_{ijk\\ell}$ and the product $T_{ijk\\ell}\\,\\delta_{im}\\,\\delta_{jn}\\,\\delta_{kp}\\,\\delta_{\\ell q}$, where $\\delta_{ab}$ is the Kronecker delta. Simplify this product to an expression that makes explicit which indices are free and which have been summed, expressing your result as a reindexed tensor. Then, state the general rule that justifies renaming dummy indices under the Einstein summation convention. Provide your final simplified expression as a single tensorial expression in index notation. No numerical approximation or units are required.", "solution": "The problem requires the simplification of the tensor product $T_{ijk\\ell}\\,\\delta_{im}\\,\\delta_{jn}\\,\\delta_{kp}\\,\\delta_{\\ell q}$ within a Cartesian framework using the Einstein summation convention (ESC).\n\nFirst, the problem statement is subjected to validation. The problem is scientifically sound, as it is based on the standard principles of tensor algebra and index notation, which are fundamental to solid mechanics and physics. It is well-posed, providing all necessary definitions (ESC, Kronecker delta) and a clear objective. The problem is objective and free of any non-scientific or ambiguous language. It is a complete and consistent problem, asking for a standard manipulation that has a unique and verifiable solution. Therefore, the problem is deemed valid and a rigorous solution will be constructed.\n\nThe expression to be simplified is $T_{ijk\\ell}\\,\\delta_{im}\\,\\delta_{jn}\\,\\delta_{kp}\\,\\delta_{\\ell q}$.\nIn accordance with the Einstein summation convention, an index appearing exactly twice in a term implies summation over its range (from $1$ to $3$ in a three-dimensional Cartesian space). In the given expression, the indices $i, j, k,$ and $\\ell$ are dummy (summation) indices. The indices $m, n, p,$ and $q$ each appear only once, and are therefore free indices. The final result will be a fourth-order tensor whose components are functions of these free indices.\n\nThe simplification relies on the fundamental \"sifting\" property of the Kronecker delta, $\\delta_{ab}$. This property states that for any tensor $A_{...i...}$, the contraction with $\\delta_{ij}$ results in the substitution of the index $i$ with $j$:\n$$A_{...i...}\\,\\delta_{ij} = A_{...j...}$$\nThis operation effectively sums over the index $i$, and due to the nature of the Kronecker delta (which is $1$ if indices are equal and $0$ otherwise), the only non-zero term in the sum is the one where $i$ is equal to $j$.\n\nWe apply this property sequentially to the given expression. The associativity of multiplication allows the contractions to be performed in any order.\n\n1.  Consider the contraction over the index $i$:\n    $$ (T_{ijk\\ell}\\,\\delta_{im})\\,\\delta_{jn}\\,\\delta_{kp}\\,\\delta_{\\ell q} $$\n    Applying the sifting property to the term in parentheses, the summation over $i$ replaces the index $i$ in the tensor $T_{ijk\\ell}$ with the index $m$. The expression simplifies to:\n    $$ T_{mjk\\ell}\\,\\delta_{jn}\\,\\delta_{kp}\\,\\delta_{\\ell q} $$\n\n2.  Next, we perform the contraction over the index $j$:\n    $$ (T_{mjk\\ell}\\,\\delta_{jn})\\,\\delta_{kp}\\,\\delta_{\\ell q} $$\n    The summation over $j$ replaces the index $j$ in $T_{mjk\\ell}$ with the index $n$. This yields:\n    $$ T_{mnk\\ell}\\,\\delta_{kp}\\,\\delta_{\\ell q} $$\n\n3.  The process continues with the contraction over the index $k$:\n    $$ (T_{mnk\\ell}\\,\\delta_{kp})\\,\\delta_{\\ell q} $$\n    The summation over $k$ replaces the index $k$ in $T_{mnk\\ell}$ with the index $p$, resulting in:\n    $$ T_{mnp\\ell}\\,\\delta_{\\ell q} $$\n\n4.  Finally, we perform the last contraction over the index $\\ell$:\n    $$ T_{mnp\\ell}\\,\\delta_{\\ell q} $$\n    The summation over $\\ell$ replaces the index $\\ell$ in $T_{mnp\\ell}$ with the index $q$. The final simplified expression is:\n    $$ T_{mnpq} $$\n\nThe result, $T_{mnpq}$, is the original tensor $T$ with its indices $i, j, k, \\ell$ relabeled to $m, n, p, q$, respectively. The operation as a whole acts as an identity transformation on the tensor's components, merely changing the names of the indices.\n\nThe problem also requires a statement of the rule for renaming dummy indices. A dummy index is a summation index and acts as a bound variable. Its specific symbol is arbitrary and does not affect the value of the expression. The general rule is: **A dummy index appearing in a term may be replaced by any other symbol that is not already in use as either a free index or another dummy index within that same term.** For example, the scalar product $v_i w_i$ is identical to $v_k w_k$, but one cannot write $v_j w_j$ if $j$ is a free index in a larger expression, such as in $A_{jk} v_i w_i$. Renaming $i$ to $j$ would result in $A_{jk} v_j w_j$, which implies a double summation over $j$ and fundamentally alters the expression's meaning and tensorial order. The uniqueness of the index symbol within a term is mandatory for clarity and correctness.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{T_{mnpq}}$$", "id": "2654067"}, {"introduction": "Tensor expressions can often be simplified to fundamental scalars that reveal underlying geometric or physical properties.

As the index sets $\\{i, j, k\\}$ and $\\{p\\}$ are disjoint, the overall operation can be decomposed into a product of two independent summations.

If any two indices are identical, $\\varepsilon_{ijk} = 0$, and thus the corresponding term in the sum is $0^{2} = 0$. Therefore, we only need to consider the terms where $(i,j,k)$ is a permutation of $(1,2,3)$.\n\nThe total number of permutations of three distinct symbols is $3! = 3 \\times 2 \\times 1 = 6$. These are the only combinations of $(i,j,k)$ that yield a non-zero contribution to the sum. We categorize these permutations:\n1. Even (or cyclic) permutations of $(1,2,3)$: These are the triples $(1,2,3)$, $(2,3,1)$, and $(3,1,2)$. For these, by definition, $\\varepsilon_{ijk} = +1$.

The value of the summand $\\varepsilon_{ijk}^{2}$ for each of these is $(-1)^{2} = 1$.\n\nIn every case where the summand is non-zero, its value is precisely $1$.
