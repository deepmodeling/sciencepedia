The relationship between the Second Piola-Kirchhoff stress $S$, the Green-Lagrange strain $E$, and the stored-energy function $W$ is fundamental.

It represents a standard, well-posed question in continuum mechanics. We will proceed to derive the solution and evaluate the options.\n\nThe fundamental premise of a hyperelastic material is that the stress work rate is equal to the rate of change of a stored elastic energy function $W(E)$. This is stated as:\n$$S : \\dot{E} = \\dot{W}$$\nSince $W$ is a function of the state variable $E$, its material time derivative $\\dot{W}$ is given by the chain rule:\n$$\\dot{W} = \\frac{\\partial W}{\\partial E} : \\dot{E}$$\nwhere $\\partial W / \\partial E$ is the gradient of the scalar field $W$ with respect to its second-order tensor argument $E$. Comparing the two expressions, we have:\n$$\\left( S - \\frac{\\partial W}{\\partial E} \\right) : \\dot{E} = 0$$\nSince this relation must hold for any arbitrary strain rate tensor $\\dot{E}$, the term in the parenthesis must be the zero tensor. This gives the core constitutive relation for hyperelasticity:\n$$S(E) = \\frac{\\partial W}{\\partial E}$$\nThe inverse problem is thus: given the stress-strain function $S(E)$, find the potential $W(E)$. This is possible if and only if $S(E)$ is a conservative field.\n\nOn a simply-connected domain, such as the open, convex set $\\mathcal{D}$, a vector (or tensor) field is conservative if and only if its curl vanishes. In the context of tensor fields, this condition translates to the symmetry of the derivative of the field. Let us write the components:\n$$S_{ij}(E) = \\frac{\\partial W(E)}{\\partial E_{ij}}$$\nThe integrability condition is the equality of mixed partial derivatives (Clairaut's theorem), assuming sufficient smoothness of $W$:\n$$\\frac{\\partial^2 W}{\\partial E_{ij} \\partial E_{kl}} = \\frac{\\partial^2 W}{\\partial E_{kl} \\partial E_{ij}}$$\nSubstituting the constitutive relation, we get:\n$$\\frac{\\partial S_{ij}}{\\partial E_{kl}} = \\frac{\\partial S_{kl}}{\\partial E_{ij}}$$\nThe term $H_{ijkl} := \\partial S_{ij}/\\partial E_{kl}$ is the material tangent stiffness tensor. The condition for the existence of $W$ is therefore $H_{ijkl} = H_{klij}$. This is known as the **major symmetry** of the stiffness tensor. It is distinct from the minor symmetries, $H_{ijkl} = H_{jikl}$ and $H_{ijkl} = H_{ijlk}$, which arise from the symmetry of the stress tensor $S$ and strain tensor $E$, respectively, and hold for any material law relating these symmetric tensors, not just hyperelastic ones.\n\nIf the major symmetry holds, the line integral of $S$ is path-independent. $W(E)$ can then be uniquely determined (up to an arbitrary constant) by integrating from a reference state, typically $E=0$, along any path $\\Gamma$:\n$$W(E) = W(0) + \\int_{\\Gamma(0 \\to E)} S(E') : dE'$$\nThe condition $H_{ijkl} = H_{klij}$ is equivalent to the statement that the integral of $S(E) : dE$ around any closed loop in $\\mathcal{D}$ is zero.\n\nNow, we evaluate each option.\n\n**A. The inverse problem is to find a scalar field $W: \\mathcal{D} \\to \\mathbb{R}$ such that $S(E) = \\partial W / \\partial E$ in the sense that $dW(E)[\\delta E] = S(E) : \\delta E$ for all virtual strains $\\delta E$. On a convex $\\mathcal{D}$ with $S$ continuously differentiable, $W$ can be recovered (up to an additive constant fixed by $W(0)=0$) by a line integral $W(E) = \\int_{\\Gamma(0 \\to E)} S(E) : dE$ that is independent of the path $\\Gamma$ if and only if $\\oint S(E) : dE = 0$ for every closed loop in $\\mathcal{D}$, equivalently if and only if the tangent $H_{ijkl}(E) := \\partial S_{ij}/\\partial E_{kl}$ satisfies the major symmetry $H_{ijkl} = H_{klij}$ almost everywhere in $\\mathcal{D}$.**\nThis statement correctly formulates the inverse problem and the relationship $S = \\partial W / \\partial E$. It correctly states the equivalences between path-independence of the line integral, the condition that all closed-loop integrals vanish, and the major symmetry condition $H_{ijkl} = H_{klij}$. These equivalences hold on a simply connected domain like the convex set $\\mathcal{D}$. The phrase \"almost everywhere\" is slightly loose for a smooth function $S$, where the condition would hold everywhere, but this does not invalidate the core logical chain. The statement is fundamentally correct.\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\n**B. It is sufficient for the existence of $W(E)$ that $S(E)$ be symmetric, i.e., $S_{ij}(E) = S_{ji}(E)$ for all $E \\in \\mathcal{D}$; no further differential constraints on $S(E)$ are required.**\nThe symmetry of the Second Piola-Kirchhoff stress tensor, $S_{ij} = S_{ji}$, is a general property derived from the balance of angular momentum and is inherent to it being conjugate to the symmetric Green-Lagrange strain tensor. This property is necessary but by no means sufficient for the existence of a stored energy function $W(E)$. As derived above, the sufficiency condition is a differential constraint on $S(E)$—the major symmetry of its tangent modulus. This statement explicitly denies the need for such a constraint.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**C. The necessary and sufficient integrability condition for the existence of $W(E)$ is that the tangent $H_{ijkl}(E) := \\partial S_{ij}/\\partial E_{kl}$ satisfy only the minor symmetries $H_{ijkl} = H_{jikl} = H_{ijlk}$; the major symmetry $H_{ijkl} = H_{klij}$ is not needed.**\nThe minor symmetries $H_{ijkl} = H_{jikl}$ and $H_{ijkl} = H_{ijlk}$ are consequences of the symmetries of the stress tensor $S$ and the strain tensor $E$, respectively. They do not ensure integrability. The necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of $W(E)$ is precisely the major symmetry, $H_{ijkl} = H_{klij}$. This statement incorrectly substitutes the minor symmetries for the required major symmetry.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. Knowledge of $S(E)$ along a single smooth loading path from $E=0$ to each target $E \\in \\mathcal{D}$ is sufficient to uniquely reconstruct $W(E)$ throughout $\\mathcal{D}$, even if measurements along other closed loops in $\\mathcal{D}$ produce nonzero values of $\\oint S : dE$.**\nThe existence of a state function $W(E)$ is conditional on the work done, $\\int S:dE$, being path-independent. A non-zero value for a closed-loop integral, $\\oint S : dE \\neq 0$, is the definitive proof that the field $S$ is non-conservative and that no such potential function $W(E)$ exists. In such a case, the material exhibits dissipation (e.g., plasticity, viscoplasticity), and the energy change depends on the process path, not just the initial and final states. Therefore, one cannot reconstruct a state function that does not exist.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**E. If $S(E)$ is continuously differentiable on the convex set $\\mathcal{D}$ and satisfies $\\partial S_{ij}/\\partial E_{kl} = \\partial S_{kl}/\\partial E_{ij}$ for all indices and all $E \\in \\mathcal{D}$, then for any $E_{0} \\in \\mathcal{D}$ the definition $W(E) = W(E_{0}) + \\int_{\\Gamma(E_{0} \\to E)} S : dE$ is path-independent and yields $S = \\partial W/\\partial E$; conversely, if $W$ exists with $S = \\partial W/\\partial E$, then the stated symmetry holds on $\\mathcal{D}$.**\nThis statement correctly formulates the necessary and sufficient condition. The condition $\\partial S_{ij}/\\partial E_{kl} = \\partial S_{kl}/\\partial E_{ij}$ is the component form of the major symmetry. The statement correctly claims that this condition (the \"if\" part) is sufficient on a convex (and thus simply-connected) set for the line integral to be path-independent, thus defining a potential $W$ such that $S = \\partial W/\\partial E$. It also correctly states the converse (the \"only if\" part), that the existence of $W$ implies this symmetry by the equality of mixed partials (Clairaut's theorem), given that $S$ is continuously differentiable. The statement is a complete and accurate representation of the integrability condition.\nVerdict: **Correct**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{AE}$$", "id": "2629874"}, {"introduction": "A direct consequence of a material's response being governed by a state function is that no net energy is dissipated in a closed deformation cycle.

The definition of an elastic solid is provided as one for which a stored strain energy density function $\\psi(\\varepsilon)$ exists, making the Cauchy stress $\\sigma$ a function of only the current strain $\\varepsilon$, and for which mechanical dissipation in any closed process is zero. The task is to identify a sound testing protocol and the corresponding correct and complete criterion to test for this defined elasticity, based on the net mechanical work per unit volume, $\\oint \\sigma \\,\\mathrm{d}\\varepsilon$.\n\nThe problem is scientifically grounded in the principles of continuum mechanics and the thermodynamics of solids. The provided definition of elasticity is a standard one-dimensional formulation of hyperelasticity, which is a conservative, rate-independent material model. The question is well-posed, objective, and contains sufficient information to determine a correct answer from first principles. There are no scientific flaws, ambiguities, or contradictions in the problem setup. Therefore, the problem statement is valid.\n\nWe proceed to derive the solution from first principles.\nThe definition of elasticity requires the existence of a strain energy density function $\\psi(\\varepsilon)$ such that the stress $\\sigma$ is uniquely determined by the strain $\\varepsilon$. In a thermodynamically consistent framework, the stress is the derivative of the strain energy with respect to strain:\n$$ \\sigma(\\varepsilon) = \\frac{\\mathrm{d}\\psi}{\\mathrm{d}\\varepsilon} $$\nThis relationship implies that stress is a single-valued function of strain, which is the hallmark of rate-independent behavior.\n\nThe mechanical work done per unit volume, $W$, during a deformation process from a strain state $\\varepsilon_A$ to a strain state $\\varepsilon_B$ is given by the integral of stress with respect to strain:\n$$ W_{A \\to B} = \\int_{\\varepsilon_A}^{\\varepsilon_B} \\sigma(\\varepsilon') \\,\\mathrm{d}\\varepsilon' $$\nIf the material is elastic in the sense defined, we can substitute the expression for stress:\n$$ W_{A \\to B} = \\int_{\\varepsilon_A}^{\\varepsilon_B} \\frac{\\mathrm{d}\\psi}{\\mathrm{d}\\varepsilon'} \\,\\mathrm{d}\\varepsilon' = \\psi(\\varepsilon_B) - \\psi(\\varepsilon_A) $$\nThis result shows that for an elastic material, the work done depends only on the initial and final states of strain, not on the path taken between them. Such a system is an example of a conservative system.\n\nThe question focuses on a closed cycle, where the process starts and ends at the same strain state, say $\\varepsilon_1$. For such a cycle, the net work done per unit volume is represented by the line integral over the closed path in the stress-strain diagram:\n$$ W_{cycle} = \\oint \\sigma \\,\\mathrm{d}\\varepsilon $$\nFor an elastic material, since the initial and final states are identical ($\\varepsilon_A = \\varepsilon_B = \\varepsilon_1$), the net work done is:\n$$ W_{cycle} = \\psi(\\varepsilon_1) - \\psi(\\varepsilon_1) = 0 $$\nThus, the existence of a strain energy function $\\psi(\\varepsilon)$ is a **sufficient** condition for the net work in any closed cycle to be zero.\n\nConversely, according to the fundamental theorem of calculus for line integrals (in one dimension), if the integral of a function $\\sigma(\\varepsilon)$ over *any* arbitrary closed path is zero ($\\oint \\sigma \\,\\mathrm{d}\\varepsilon = 0$), then $\\sigma(\\varepsilon)\\,\\mathrm{d}\\varepsilon$ must be an exact differential of some potential function, which we call $\\psi(\\varepsilon)$. This means a function $\\psi(\\varepsilon)$ must exist such that $\\sigma = \\mathrm{d}\\psi/\\mathrm{d}\\varepsilon$. The existence of such a function is the definition of elasticity provided in the problem. Therefore, the condition $\\oint \\sigma \\,\\mathrm{d}\\varepsilon = 0$ for all closed cycles is also a **necessary** condition for elasticity.\n\nIn summary, the criterion $\\oint \\sigma \\,\\mathrm{d}\\varepsilon = 0$ for all closed cycles is both necessary and sufficient for a material to be elastic under the given definition.\n\nAn experimental protocol to test this criterion must create a closed loop and be conducted under conditions that isolate the elastic response. The problem assumes isothermal conditions and negligible inertia, which are achieved by performing the test quasi-statically (i.e., at a very slow, near-zero rate). A slow rate is also essential to eliminate any rate-dependent effects, such as viscoplasticity or viscoelasticity, which would otherwise cause dissipation ($\\oint \\sigma \\,\\mathrm{d}\\varepsilon > 0$) and confound the test for pure elasticity. A symmetric, strain-controlled triangular waveform that loads and unloads the material through both tension and compression is a standard and effective protocol for creating a closed cycle around the origin.\n\nWe now evaluate each option.\n\nA. This option proposes a strain-controlled, symmetric triangular waveform performed slowly to ensure quasi-static and isothermal conditions. This is a sound experimental protocol. It states that for every such closed cycle, the loop area $\\oint \\sigma \\,\\mathrm{d}\\varepsilon$ must be zero. This is the correct test, as the property must hold for any cycle, not just one. It correctly claims this condition is both necessary and sufficient for the existence of a strain energy density $\\psi(\\varepsilon)$ with $\\sigma = \\partial \\psi / \\partial \\varepsilon$. This logic is perfectly aligned with the thermodynamic first principles derived above. The use of the partial derivative is formally correct and reduces to the total derivative in this one-dimensional case.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\nB. This option proposes a stress-controlled sinusoidal protocol. While this is a valid way to cycle a material, its criterion is flawed. It claims that for an elastic solid, $\\oint \\sigma \\,\\mathrm{d}\\varepsilon = 0$ only if the mean stress $\\sigma_m$ is zero. This is false. For a truly elastic material, the stress-strain response is a single curve, and any closed cycle, regardless of its center point $(\\sigma_m, \\varepsilon_m)$, will simply trace back and forth along this curve, enclosing zero area. The net work in a closed cycle for an elastic solid is always zero, independent of mean stress. The premise that path asymmetry causes dissipation in an elastic solid is fundamentally incorrect.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\nC. This option proposes testing at a finite frequency, which is contrary to the requirement of a quasi-static process needed to isolate the rate-independent elastic response. It then claims that a Maxwell-type viscoelastic solid could also show $\\oint \\sigma \\,\\mathrm{d}\\varepsilon = 0$, making the test non-diagnostic. This is a complete misrepresentation of viscoelasticity. At any finite frequency (non-zero rate), a viscoelastic material will exhibit hysteresis due to its viscous component, leading to energy dissipation where $\\oint \\sigma \\,\\mathrm{d}\\varepsilon > 0$. Zero loop area at a finite frequency would imply the absence of viscous effects, which is characteristic of elasticity, not a confounding factor from viscoelasticity. The only way a Maxwell model gives zero loop area is in the quasi-static limit ($\\omega \\to 0$), where it behaves like its purely elastic component.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\nD. This option proposes an asymmetric loading path from $\\varepsilon=0$ to $\\varepsilon=+\\varepsilon_{\\max}$ and back to $\\varepsilon=+\\varepsilon_r$ where $\\varepsilon_r > 0$. This is not a closed cycle, as the start point ($\\varepsilon=0$) and end point ($\\varepsilon=\\varepsilon_r$) are different. The use of the closed-loop integral symbol $\\oint$ is therefore inappropriate. The net work for this open path, $\\int_0^{\\varepsilon_r} \\sigma \\,\\mathrm{d}\\varepsilon$, is generally non-zero even for an elastic material, as it represents the change in stored strain energy $\\psi(\\varepsilon_r) - \\psi(0)$. The claim that the net work must be zero is false.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\nE. This option states that $\\oint \\sigma \\,\\mathrm{d}\\varepsilon=0$ is sufficient but not necessary for elasticity. This directly contradicts the provided problem definition and fundamental thermodynamics. The definition explicitly states that for an elastic solid, \"mechanical dissipation vanishes in any closed process,\" which mathematically means $\\oint \\sigma \\,\\mathrm{d}\\varepsilon = 0$. Therefore, zero loop area is a necessary condition. The statement that \"some elastic solids may exhibit $\\oint \\sigma \\,\\mathrm{d}\\varepsilon>0$\" is a contradiction in terms. The alternative criterion proposed regarding stiffness is also flawed, as it confuses linearity with elasticity.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\nBased on this rigorous analysis, Option A is the only one that provides a scientifically sound protocol and a correct, complete criterion consistent with first principles.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2629918"}, {"introduction": "Having established the conditions for elasticity, we can apply the concept to derive constitutive laws from a given energy potential.

We work with the energy density (energy per unit reference volume) and define a modified stored-energy function, $\\tilde{W}$:\n$$\n\\tilde{W}(\\boldsymbol{F}, p) = W(\\boldsymbol{C}(\\boldsymbol{F})) - p(J(\\boldsymbol{F}) - 1)\n$$\nThe second Piola-Kirchhoff stress tensor, $\\boldsymbol{S}$, is energetically conjugate to the right Cauchy-Green tensor, $\\boldsymbol{C}$. Its relationship to the stored energy function is given by:\n$$\n\\boldsymbol{S} = 2 \\frac{\\partial \\tilde{W}}{\\partial \\boldsymbol{C}}\n$$\nWe substitute the expression for $\\tilde{W}$. Note that $J = \\det(\\boldsymbol{F}) = \\sqrt{\\det(\\boldsymbol{C})}$.\n$$\n\\boldsymbol{S} = 2 \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\boldsymbol{C}} \\left[ \\frac{\\mu}{2}(\\operatorname{tr}\\boldsymbol{C} - 3) - p(\\sqrt{\\det\\boldsymbol{C}} - 1) \\right]\n$$\nThis requires us to compute two tensor derivatives.\nFirst, the derivative of the trace of $\\boldsymbol{C}$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial (\\operatorname{tr}\\boldsymbol{C})}{\\partial \\boldsymbol{C}} = \\boldsymbol{I}\n$$\nwhere $\\boldsymbol{I}$ is the second-order identity tensor.\nSecond, the derivative of the determinant of $\\boldsymbol{C}$. Using Jacobi's formula, $\\frac{\\partial (\\det\\boldsymbol{A})}{\\partial \\boldsymbol{A}} = (\\det\\boldsymbol{A})\\boldsymbol{A}^{-\\mathsf{T}}$, and noting that $\\boldsymbol{C}$ is symmetric, we have $\\frac{\\partial (\\det\\boldsymbol{C})}{\\partial \\boldsymbol{C}} = (\\det\\boldsymbol{C})\\boldsymbol{C}^{-1}$.\nNow we can find the derivative of $J = \\sqrt{\\det\\boldsymbol{C}}$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial J}{\\partial \\boldsymbol{C}} = \\frac{\\partial (\\det\\boldsymbol{C})^{1/2}}{\\partial \\boldsymbol{C}} = \\frac{1}{2}(\\det\\boldsymbol{C})^{-1/2} \\frac{\\partial (\\det\\boldsymbol{C})}{\\partial \\boldsymbol{C}} = \\frac{1}{2J} (J^2 \\boldsymbol{C}^{-1}) = \\frac{J}{2} \\boldsymbol{C}^{-1}\n$$\nSubstituting these derivatives back into the expression for $\\boldsymbol{S}$:\n$$\n\\boldsymbol{S} = 2 \\left[ \\frac{\\mu}{2} \\boldsymbol{I} - p \\left( \\frac{J}{2} \\boldsymbol{C}^{-1} \\right) \\right] = \\mu \\boldsymbol{I} - p J \\boldsymbol{C}^{-1}\n$$\nThis is the general expression for the second Piola-Kirchhoff stress. The problem states that the incompressibility constraint $J=1$ holds. Applying this constraint simplifies the expression for $\\boldsymbol{S}$:\n$$\n\\boldsymbol{S} = \\mu \\boldsymbol{I} - p \\boldsymbol{C}^{-1}\n$$\nThe problem requires the Cauchy stress tensor $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}$, which is the true stress in the deformed configuration. The relationship between the Cauchy stress $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}$ and the second Piola-Kirchhoff stress $\\boldsymbol{S}$ is given by a push-forward operation:\n$$\n\\boldsymbol{\\sigma} = \\frac{1}{J} \\boldsymbol{F} \\boldsymbol{S} \\boldsymbol{F}^{\\mathsf{T}}\n$$\nAgain, substituting $J=1$:\n$$\n\\boldsymbol{\\sigma} = \\boldsymbol{F} \\boldsymbol{S} \\boldsymbol{F}^{\\mathsf{T}}\n$$\nWe now substitute the expression for $\\boldsymbol{S}$:\n$$\n\\boldsymbol{\\sigma} = \\boldsymbol{F} (\\mu \\boldsymbol{I} - p \\boldsymbol{C}^{-1}) \\boldsymbol{F}^{\\mathsf{T}} = \\mu \\boldsymbol{F} \\boldsymbol{I} \\boldsymbol{F}^{\\mathsf{T}} - p \\boldsymbol{F} \\boldsymbol{C}^{-1} \\boldsymbol{F}^{\\mathsf{T}}\n$$\nLet us simplify the two terms on the right-hand side.\nThe first term contains $\\boldsymbol{F}\\boldsymbol{F}^{\\mathsf{T}}$, which is by definition the left Cauchy-Green tensor $\\boldsymbol{b}$.\n$$\n\\mu \\boldsymbol{F} \\boldsymbol{F}^{\\mathsf{T}} = \\mu \\boldsymbol{b}\n$$\nFor the second term, we use the definition $\\boldsymbol{C} = \\boldsymbol{F}^{\\mathsf{T}}\\boldsymbol{F}$, which implies $\\boldsymbol{C}^{-1} = (\\boldsymbol{F}^{\\mathsf{T}}\\boldsymbol{F})^{-1} = \\boldsymbol{F}^{-1}(\\boldsymbol{F}^{\\mathsf{T}})^{-1} = \\boldsymbol{F}^{-1}\\boldsymbol{F}^{-\\mathsf{T}}$.\n$$\np \\boldsymbol{F} \\boldsymbol{C}^{-1} \\boldsymbol{F}^{\\mathsf{T}} = p \\boldsymbol{F} (\\boldsymbol{F}^{-1}\\boldsymbol{F}^{-\\mathsf{T}}) \\boldsymbol{F}^{\\mathsf{T}} = p (\\boldsymbol{F}\\boldsymbol{F}^{-1}) (\\boldsymbol{F}^{-\\mathsf{T}}\\boldsymbol{F}^{\\mathsf{T}}) = p \\boldsymbol{I} \\boldsymbol{I} = p\\boldsymbol{I}\n$$\nCombining the simplified terms yields the final expression for the Cauchy stress tensor:\n$$\n\\boldsymbol{\\sigma} = \\mu \\boldsymbol{b} - p \\boldsymbol{I}\n$$\nThis is the constitutive equation for an incompressible neo-Hookean material. The physical meaning of the Lagrange multiplier $p$ is that of an indeterminate hydrostatic pressure. It is not a material parameter but a field variable that adjusts itself to maintain the kinematic constraint of incompressibility.\nTo show explicitly how $p$ enforces the constraint, consider the stationarity of the modified energy functional $\\Pi = \\int \\tilde{W} dV_0$ with respect to variations in the field $p$. The first variation $\\delta_p \\Pi$ must be zero:\n$$\n\\delta_p \\Pi = \\int_{V_0} \\frac{\\partial \\tilde{W}}{\\partial p} \\delta p \\, dV_0 = \\int_{V_0} -(J-1) \\delta p \\, dV_0 = 0\n$$\nSince this must hold for any arbitrary variation $\\delta p$, the term multiplying it must vanish pointwise. This directly yields the constraint equation:\n$$\nJ - 1 = 0 \\quad \\implies \\quad J = 1\n$$\nThus, the Lagrange multiplier $p$ is precisely the field whose governing equation is the incompressibility constraint itself.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\boldsymbol{\\sigma} = \\mu \\boldsymbol{b} - p \\boldsymbol{I}}$$", "id": "2629895"}]}
