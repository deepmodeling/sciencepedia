It describes a classic scenario of thermally activated surface diffusion, formulated using fundamental principles of statistical mechanics and kinetics.

Basis (i) gives the attempt frequency, $\\nu$, which is the rate at which the adatom attempts to cross the energy barrier from its local potential well. Basis (ii) uses the canonical Boltzmann distribution to define the probability of a successful attempt. A successful attempt requires the adatom to possess thermal energy equal to or greater than the migration energy barrier, $E_{m}$. The probability, $P_{\\text{success}}$, for such an event is given by the Boltzmann factor:\n$$ P_{\\text{success}} = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_{m}}{k_{B}T}\\right) $$\nwhere $k_{B}$ is the Boltzmann constant and $T$ is the absolute temperature.

It is a standard exercise in the statistical mechanics of transport phenomena, specifically the theory of random walks. All necessary parameters and conditions are provided, and the problem is well-posed. We shall proceed with the derivation.\n\nThe starting point is the definition of the two-dimensional diffusion coefficient, $D$, which relates the mean-squared displacement (MSD) of a particle to time, $t$, in the long-time limit:\n$$ D = \\lim_{t \\to \\infty} \\frac{\\langle |\\vec{r}(t) - \\vec{r}(0)|^2 \\rangle}{4t} $$\nFor convenience, let the origin of our coordinate system coincide with the initial position of the adatom, so $\\vec{r}(0) = \\vec{0}$. The displacement vector at time $t$ is then $\\vec{R}(t) = \\vec{r}(t)$. The effective diffusion coefficient, $D_{\\mathrm{eff}}$, is therefore:\n$$ D_{\\mathrm{eff}} = \\lim_{t \\to \\infty} \\frac{\\langle |\\vec{R}(t)|^2 \\rangle}{4t} $$\nThe total displacement $\\vec{R}(t)$ is the vector sum of all individual displacements from both hopping and exchange events that occur within the time interval $[0, t]$. Let $N_h(t)$ be the number of hopping events and $N_x(t)$ be the number of exchange events in this interval. Let $\\vec{s}_{h,i}$ be the displacement vector for the $i$-th hopping event and $\\vec{s}_{x,j}$ be the displacement vector for the $j$-th exchange event. The total displacement is:\n$$ \\vec{R}(t) = \\sum_{i=1}^{N_h(t)} \\vec{s}_{h,i} + \\sum_{j=1}^{N_x(t)} \\vec{s}_{x,j} $$\nWe must now compute the mean-squared displacement, $\\langle |\\vec{R}(t)|^2 \\rangle = \\langle \\vec{R}(t) \\cdot \\vec{R}(t) \\rangle$. The expectation value $\\langle \\dots \\rangle$ denotes an average over all possible stochastic trajectories, which includes averaging over the number of events of each type and the random directions of each step.\n$$ \\langle |\\vec{R}(t)|^2 \\rangle = \\left\\langle \\left( \\sum_{i=1}^{N_h(t)} \\vec{s}_{h,i} + \\sum_{j=1}^{N_x(t)} \\vec{s}_{x,j} \\right) \\cdot \\left( \\sum_{k=1}^{N_h(t)} \\vec{s}_{h,k} + \\sum_{l=1}^{N_x(t)} \\vec{s}_{x,l} \\right) \\right\\rangle $$\nExpanding the dot product gives four terms:\n$$ \\langle |\\vec{R}(t)|^2 \\rangle = \\left\\langle \\sum_{i,k=1}^{N_h(t)} \\vec{s}_{h,i} \\cdot \\vec{s}_{h,k} \\right\\rangle + \\left\\langle \\sum_{j,l=1}^{N_x(t)} \\vec{s}_{x,j} \\cdot \\vec{s}_{x,l} \\right\\rangle + 2\\left\\langle \\sum_{i=1}^{N_h(t)} \\sum_{j=1}^{N_x(t)} \\vec{s}_{h,i} \\cdot \\vec{s}_{x,j} \\right\\rangle $$\nAccording to the problem statement, all displacement events are uncorrelated. This implies that for any two distinct events, the expectation of their dot product is the dot product of their expectations: $\\langle \\vec{s}_{\\alpha, i} \\cdot \\vec{s}_{\\beta, j} \\rangle = \\langle \\vec{s}_{\\alpha, i} \\rangle \\cdot \\langle \\vec{s}_{\\beta, j} \\rangle$ for $(\\alpha, i) \\neq (\\beta, j)$.\nSince the step directions are uniformly random for both processes, the average displacement for any single step is the zero vector: $\\langle \\vec{s}_{h,i} \\rangle = \\vec{0}$ and $\\langle \\vec{s}_{x,j} \\rangle = \\vec{0}$ for all $i, j$.\nConsequently, all cross-terms in the sums where the indices are different vanish. For example, in the first term, $\\langle \\vec{s}_{h,i} \\cdot \\vec{s}_{h,k} \\rangle = 0$ for $i \\neq k$. The same applies to the second term. The third term vanishes entirely because $\\langle \\vec{s}_{h,i} \\cdot \\vec{s}_{x,j} \\rangle = \\langle \\vec{s}_{h,i} \\rangle \\cdot \\langle \\vec{s}_{x,j} \\rangle = \\vec{0} \\cdot \\vec{0} = 0$, as the two mechanisms are independent.\nThe expression for the MSD therefore simplifies to include only the diagonal terms ($i=k$ and $j=l$):\n$$ \\langle |\\vec{R}(t)|^2 \\rangle = \\left\\langle \\sum_{i=1}^{N_h(t)} |\\vec{s}_{h,i}|^2 + \\sum_{j=1}^{N_x(t)} |\\vec{s}_{x,j}|^2 \\right\\rangle $$\nThe magnitudes of the displacement vectors are given as fixed constants: $|\\vec{s}_{h,i}| = a_h$ and $|\\vec{s}_{x,j}| = a_x$. Thus, $|\\vec{s}_{h,i}|^2 = a_h^2$ and $|\\vec{s}_{x,j}|^2 = a_x^2$.\n$$ \\langle |\\vec{R}(t)|^2 \\rangle = \\left\\langle N_h(t) a_h^2 + N_x(t) a_x^2 \\right\\rangle $$\nBy the linearity of the expectation operator, this becomes:\n$$ \\langle |\\vec{R}(t)|^2 \\rangle = a_h^2 \\langle N_h(t) \\rangle + a_x^2 \\langle N_x(t) \\rangle $$\nThe problem states that hopping and exchange are independent Poisson processes with rates $k_h$ and $k_x$, respectively. The mean number of events for a Poisson process with rate $\\lambda$ over a time interval $t$ is $\\langle N(t) \\rangle = \\lambda t$. Applying this to our two processes:\n$$ \\langle N_h(t) \\rangle = k_h t $$\n$$ \\langle N_x(t) \\rangle = k_x t $$\nSubstituting these results into the expression for the MSD, we obtain:\n$$ \\langle |\\vec{R}(t)|^2 \\rangle = a_h^2 (k_h t) + a_x^2 (k_x t) = (k_h a_h^2 + k_x a_x^2)t $$\nThis demonstrates that the MSD grows linearly with time, which is the hallmark of diffusive motion. The long-time limit is therefore trivial.\nFinally, we compute the effective diffusion coefficient using its definition:\n$$ D_{\\mathrm{eff}} = \\lim_{t \\to \\infty} \\frac{(k_h a_h^2 + k_x a_x^2)t}{4t} $$\nThe factor of $t$ cancels, yielding the final expression:\n$$ D_{\\mathrm{eff}} = \\frac{k_h a_h^2 + k_x a_x^2}{4} $$\nThis result can be interpreted as the sum of the individual diffusion coefficients contributed by each independent mechanism, $D_{\\mathrm{eff}} = D_h + D_x$, where $D_h = \\frac{k_h a_h^2}{4}$ and $D_x = \\frac{k_x a_x^2}{4}$.
