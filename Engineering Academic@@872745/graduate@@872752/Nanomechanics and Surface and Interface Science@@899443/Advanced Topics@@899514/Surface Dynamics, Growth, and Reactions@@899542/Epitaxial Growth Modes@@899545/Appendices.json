It is not incomplete, contradictory, unrealistic, or trivial.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is deemed valid. A solution will be furnished.\n\nThe equilibrium configuration of a system is determined by the minimization of its total free energy. In the context of a film deposited on a substrate, the wetting behavior is governed by the balance of surface and interfacial energies. The change in free energy per unit area, $\\Delta\\gamma$, when the substrate surface is covered by a film is given by the replacement of the substrate-vapor interface with a film-substrate and a film-vapor interface.\n$$\n\\Delta\\gamma = (\\gamma_{fs} + \\gamma_{fv}) - \\gamma_{sv}\n$$\nThe condition for spontaneous spreading, or complete wetting, is that this change must be non-positive, $\\Delta\\gamma \\le 0$. This means it is energetically favorable for the film to cover the substrate. This condition, $\\gamma_{sv} \\ge \\gamma_{fs} + \\gamma_{fv}$, corresponds to the Frank-van der Merwe (layer-by-layer) growth mode.\n\nConversely, if $\\Delta\\gamma  0$, or $\\gamma_{sv}  \\gamma_{fs} + \\gamma_{fv}$, it is energetically unfavorable to wet the substrate, and the film will form three-dimensional islands to minimize its contact area with the substrate. This corresponds to the Volmer-Weber (island) growth mode.\n\nThe Stranski–Krastanov mode involves initial layer-by-layer growth followed by island formation. This transition is typically driven by the accumulation of elastic strain energy due to lattice mismatch between the film and substrate. The problem statement explicitly requires that this strain energy be considered negligible. Therefore, we only need to distinguish between the Frank-van der Merwe and Volmer-Weber modes based on the surface and interfacial energies.\n\nLet us evaluate the wetting condition using the given data:\n-   $\\gamma_{sv} = 1.8\\,\\mathrm{J/m^2}$\n-   $\\gamma_{fv} = 1.2\\,\\mathrm{J/m^2}$\n-   $\\gamma_{fs} = 0.5\\,\\mathrm{J/m^2}$\n\nWe compare $\\gamma_{sv}$ with the sum $\\gamma_{fs} + \\gamma_{fv}$:\n$$\n\\gamma_{fs} + \\gamma_{fv} = 0.5\\,\\mathrm{J/m^2} + 1.2\\,\\mathrm{J/m^2} = 1.7\\,\\mathrm{J/m^2}\n$$\nSince $\\gamma_{sv} = 1.8\\,\\mathrm{J/m^2}$ and $\\gamma_{fs} + \\gamma_{fv} = 1.7\\,\\mathrm{J/m^2}$, we find that:\n$$\n\\gamma_{sv}  \\gamma_{fs} + \\gamma_{fv}\n$$\nThis inequality ($1.8  1.7$) signifies that the system's free energy is minimized when the high-energy substrate-vapor interface is replaced by the lower-energy combination of a film-substrate and a film-vapor interface. This condition corresponds to complete wetting. The expected epitaxial growth mode is therefore Frank-van der Merwe (layer-by-layer growth).\n\nThe equilibrium contact angle, $\\theta$, is determined by the balance of horizontal forces at the three-phase (solid-liquid-vapor) contact line, as described by Young's equation:\n$$\n\\gamma_{sv} = \\gamma_{fs} + \\gamma_{fv} \\cos(\\theta)\n$$\nSolving for $\\cos(\\theta)$ yields:\n$$\n\\cos(\\theta) = \\frac{\\gamma_{sv} - \\gamma_{fs}}{\\gamma_{fv}}\n$$\nSubstituting the provided numerical values:\n$$\n\\cos(\\theta) = \\frac{1.8 - 0.5}{1.2} = \\frac{1.3}{1.2}\n$$\nThis calculation results in $\\cos(\\theta) \\approx 1.0833$. The range of the cosine function is $[-1, 1]$. A value of $\\cos(\\theta)  1$ is not mathematically possible for a real angle $\\theta$. This physical unfulfillment of Young's equation indicates that no static equilibrium with a finite contact angle can be achieved. The horizontal force component pulling the film to spread ($\\gamma_{sv} - \\gamma_{fs}$) is greater than the maximum cohesive force of the film's surface tension that resists spreading ($\\gamma_{fv}$). This results in an unbalanced force that drives the film to spread completely over the substrate, forming a uniform layer. For such a case of complete wetting, the equilibrium contact angle is, by definition, exactly zero.\n\nTherefore, the system exhibits complete wetting, the growth mode is Frank-van der Merwe, and the equilibrium contact angle is $\\theta = 0$ radians.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{0}\n$$", "id": "2771241"}, {"introduction": "In many real systems, the lattice mismatch between the film and substrate introduces significant elastic strain, a factor often ignored in purely surface-energy-based analyses.

It represents a standard calculation in the theory of elasticity as applied to thin films and is directly relevant to the study of epitaxial growth phenomena. I will proceed with the derivation.\n\nThe objective is to derive the elastic strain energy per unit area, $U(h)$, stored in a coherent, biaxially strained thin film of thickness $h$. Let us establish a coordinate system where the film lies in the $x-y$ plane, with the interface at $z=0$ and the free surface at $z=h$.\n\nThe problem states that the film is grown coherently on a substrate with a uniform in-plane misfit strain $f$. This imposes a uniform biaxial strain state on the film. The in-plane normal strains are therefore equal to the misfit strain:\n$$ \\varepsilon_{xx} = f $$\n$$ \\varepsilon_{yy} = f $$\nDue to the biaxial symmetry, the in-plane shear strains are zero: $\\varepsilon_{xy} = 0$. The problem also states a \"spatially uniform strain state\", which means all strain components are constant throughout the film thickness.\n\nThe film has a traction-free surface, which means the stress component normal to this surface is zero, i.e., $\\sigma_{zz}=0$ at $z=h$. The given condition of a uniform strain state is interpreted as implying this condition holds throughout the entire film thickness, which is the standard plane-stress approximation for a thin film. Thus, we have:\n$$ \\sigma_{zz} = 0 $$\nBy symmetry, the other shear stresses are also zero: $\\sigma_{xz} = \\sigma_{yz} = 0$.\n\nWe use the constitutive relations for a linear isotropic elastic material (Hooke's Law).

The equations become identical:\n$$ f = \\frac{1}{E} [ \\sigma_{\\parallel} - \\nu \\sigma_{\\parallel} ] = \\frac{\\sigma_{\\parallel}}{E} (1-\\nu) $$\nSolving for the in-plane stress, we find:\n$$ \\sigma_{xx} = \\sigma_{yy} = \\sigma_{\\parallel} = \\frac{E f}{1-\\nu} $$\n\nNow, we determine the strain in the out-of-plane direction, $\\varepsilon_{zz}$, using the third constitutive equation with $\\sigma_{zz} = 0$ and $\\sigma_{xx} = \\sigma_{yy} = \\sigma_{\\parallel}$:\n$$ \\varepsilon_{zz} = \\frac{1}{E} [ 0 - \\nu (\\sigma_{\\parallel} + \\sigma_{\\parallel}) ] = -\\frac{2\\nu \\sigma_{\\parallel}}{E} $$\nSubstituting the expression for $\\sigma_{\\parallel}$:\n$$ \\varepsilon_{zz} = -\\frac{2\\nu}{E} \\left( \\frac{E f}{1-\\nu} \\right) = - \\frac{2\\nu f}{1-\\nu} $$\n\nThe elastic strain energy density, $u$, is given by the general formula $u = \\frac{1}{2} \\sigma_{ij} \\varepsilon_{ij}$. In our case, with non-zero components only for $\\sigma_{xx}$, $\\sigma_{yy}$, $\\varepsilon_{xx}$, $\\varepsilon_{yy}$, and $\\varepsilon_{zz}$ (but importantly, $\\sigma_{zz}=0$), this simplifies to:\n$$ u = \\frac{1}{2} (\\sigma_{xx}\\varepsilon_{xx} + \\sigma_{yy}\\varepsilon_{yy} + \\sigma_{zz}\\varepsilon_{zz}) $$\nSince $\\sigma_{zz}=0$, the third term vanishes.\n$$ u = \\frac{1}{2} (\\sigma_{xx}\\varepsilon_{xx} + \\sigma_{yy}\\varepsilon_{yy}) $$\nSubstituting the expressions for the stresses and strains:\n$$ u = \\frac{1}{2} \\left( \\left(\\frac{E f}{1-\\nu}\\right) f + \\left(\\frac{E f}{1-\\nu}\\right) f \\right) = \\frac{1}{2} \\left( 2 \\frac{E f^2}{1-\\nu} \\right) $$\n$$ u = \\frac{E f^2}{1-\\nu} $$\nThis expression for the strain energy per unit volume is uniform throughout the film.\n\nThe total elastic strain energy per unit area of the film, $U(h)$, is obtained by integrating the strain energy density $u$ over the film thickness $h$:\n$$ U(h) = \\int_0^h u \\, dz $$\nSince $u$ is uniform with respect to $z$:\n$$ U(h) = u \\cdot h = \\frac{E f^2 h}{1-\\nu} $$\nThis is the desired analytical expression for the elastic strain energy per unit area.\n\nAn additional assumption made here is the interpretation of the \"spatially uniform strain state\" to justify the plane-stress condition ($\\sigma_{zz}=0$) throughout the entire film thickness.

Your explanation will not be graded numerically; only the numerical value of $R$ will be graded.", "solution": "The problem statement has been evaluated and is determined to be valid. It is scientifically grounded in the principles of surface kinetics, specifically the Arrhenius-type behavior of atomic hopping in epitaxial growth. The problem is well-posed, providing all necessary constants and conditions to derive a unique and meaningful numerical answer. It is objective and free of ambiguity.\n\nThe task is to derive and calculate the ratio $R$ of the interlayer to the intralayer hopping rates for adatoms on a crystalline surface. We begin with the provided Arrhenius form for a thermally activated hopping rate, $k$:\n\n$$k = \\nu_0 \\exp\\!\\left(-\\frac{E_a}{k_B T}\\right)$$\n\nwhere $\\nu_0$ is the attempt frequency, $E_a$ is the activation energy barrier for the hop, $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant, and $T$ is the absolute temperature.\n\nFirst, we define the intralayer hopping rate, which we denote as $k_{intra}$. This process corresponds to an adatom hopping on a flat terrace. The activation barrier for this process is given as $E_D$. Therefore, the rate is:\n\n$$k_{intra} = \\nu_0 \\exp\\!\\left(-\\frac{E_D}{k_B T}\\right)$$\n\nNext, we define the interlayer hopping rate, denoted as $k_{inter}$. This process corresponds to a downward hop of an adatom over a step edge. The problem states that this process has an additional Ehrlich-Schwoebel (ES) barrier, $E_{ES}$. Thus, the total activation barrier for the interlayer hop is $E_D + E_{ES}$. The rate is:\n\n$$k_{inter} = \\nu_0 \\exp\\!\\left(-\\frac{E_D + E_{ES}}{k_B T}\\right)$$\n\nWe are given that the attempt frequency, $\\nu_0$, is identical for both processes. This is a crucial simplification.\n\nThe problem asks for the ratio $R$ of the interlayer to the intralayer hopping rates. We define this ratio as:\n\n$$R = \\frac{k_{inter}}{k_{intra}}$$\n\nSubstituting the expressions for $k_{inter}$ and $k_{intra}$ into this definition yields:\n\n$$R = \\frac{\\nu_0 \\exp\\!\\left(-\\frac{E_D + E_{ES}}{k_B T}\\right)}{\\nu_0 \\exp\\!\\left(-\\frac{E_D}{k_B T}\\right)}$$\n\nThe attempt frequency $\\nu_0$ cancels from the numerator and denominator. We can then use the property of exponents, $\\exp(a-b) = \\exp(a)/\\exp(b)$, to simplify the expression:\n\n$$R = \\exp\\!\\left(-\\frac{E_D + E_{ES}}{k_B T} - \\left(-\\frac{E_D}{k_B T}\\right)\\right)$$\n$$R = \\exp\\!\\left(\\frac{-E_D - E_{ES} + E_D}{k_B T}\\right)$$\n$$R = \\exp\\!\\left(-\\frac{E_{ES}}{k_B T}\\right)$$\n\nThis is the final symbolic expression for the ratio $R$. It demonstrates that the ratio of rates depends only on the additional ES barrier and not on the base diffusion barrier $E_D$.\n\nNow, we must evaluate this expression numerically using the provided values:\n- $E_{ES} = 0.12\\,\\mathrm{eV}$\n- $T = 550\\,\\mathrm{K}$\n- $k_B = 8.617333262 \\times 10^{-5}\\,\\mathrm{eV\\,K^{-1}}$\n\nFirst, we calculate the thermal energy, $k_B T$:\n\n$$k_B T = (8.617333262 \\times 10^{-5}\\,\\mathrm{eV\\,K^{-1}}) \\times (550\\,\\mathrm{K})$$\n$$k_B T \\approx 0.04739533\\,\\mathrm{eV}$$\n\nNext, we calculate the dimensionless exponent $-\\frac{E_{ES}}{k_B T}$:\n\n$$-\\frac{E_{ES}}{k_B T} = -\\frac{0.12\\,\\mathrm{eV}}{0.04739533\\,\\mathrm{eV}} \\approx -2.53191$$\n\nFinally, we calculate the ratio $R$:\n\n$$R = \\exp(-2.53191) \\approx 0.079513$$\n\nThe problem requires the result to be rounded to three significant figures.\n\n$$R \\approx 0.0795$$\n\nRegarding the expected epitaxial morphology, the derived ratio $R$ is significantly less than $1$. This indicates that the rate of interlayer transport (an adatom hopping down to a lower layer) is substantially suppressed compared to the rate of intralayer transport (an adatom moving on the same terrace). Specifically, an adatom is approximately $1 / 0.0795 \\approx 12.6$ times more likely to hop on its current terrace than to descend a step edge.\nThis kinetic limitation is the hallmark of the Ehrlich-Schwoebel effect. Adatoms arriving on an upper terrace are kinetically trapped there, increasing their local concentration and promoting the nucleation of new islands on top of existing, incomplete layers. This process prevents the system from achieving smooth, layer-by-layer growth (Frank-van der Merwe mode), which would be the thermodynamically favored outcome if wetting conditions are good ($ \\gamma_s  \\gamma_f + \\gamma_i $, where $\\gamma_s$, $\\gamma_f$, and $\\gamma_i$ are the substrate, film, and interface surface energies, respectively). Instead, the ES barrier drives the system towards a three-dimensional morphology characterized by the formation of mounds or \"wedding cakes.\" This phenomenon is a form of kinetic roughening. It is important to distinguish this from the thermodynamically-driven islanding of the Volmer-Weber mode (poor wetting) or the Stranski-Krastanov mode (strain-induced islanding after initial layer-by-layer growth). The morphology here is 3D due to kinetic constraints, not thermodynamic preference.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.0795}$$", "id": "2771235"}]}
