The inverse Hooke's law is $\\varepsilon_{ij} = S_{ijkl} \\sigma_{kl}$. Substituting the expression for the uniaxial stress tensor, we get\n$$\n\\varepsilon_{ij} = S_{ijkl} (\\sigma_{nn} n_k n_l) = \\sigma_{nn} S_{ijkl} n_k n_l.\n$$\nThe longitudinal strain $\\varepsilon_{nn}$ is the projection of the strain tensor $\\varepsilon_{ij}$ onto the direction $\\mathbf{n}$, given by $\\varepsilon_{nn} = \\varepsilon_{ij} n_i n_j$. Substituting the expression for $\\varepsilon_{ij}$ yields\n$$\n\\varepsilon_{nn} = (\\sigma_{nn} S_{ijkl} n_k n_l) n_i n_j = \\sigma_{nn} (S_{ijkl} n_i n_j n_k n_l).\n$$\nThis is the required expression for $\\varepsilon_{nn}$ in terms of $\\sigma_{nn}$ and $S_{ijkl}$.\n\nFrom the definition of Young's modulus, $E(\\mathbf{n}) = \\sigma_{nn} / \\varepsilon_{nn}$, we can write\n$$\n\\frac{1}{E(\\mathbf{n})} = \\frac{\\varepsilon_{nn}}{\\sigma_{nn}} = S_{ijkl} n_i n_j n_k n_l.\n$$\nWe now specialize this formula to the direction $\\mathbf{n} = \\mathbf{e}_2$, which corresponds to the vector $(0, 1, 0)$. The components of this vector are $n_1=0$, $n_2=1$, and $n_3=0$. The quadruple product $n_i n_j n_k n_l$ is non-zero only when all indices are equal to $2$. Thus, the sum reduces to a single term:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{E(\\mathbf{e}_2)} = S_{2222} n_2 n_2 n_2 n_2 = S_{2222} (1)^4 = S_{2222}.\n$$\nTo evaluate this, we must relate the tensor component $S_{2222}$ to the component of the compliance matrix in Voigt notation, $S_{22}$. For indices $i, j, k, l \\in \\{1, 2, 3\\}$, the conversion is direct: $S_{ijkl} = S_{\\alpha\\beta}$, where $\\alpha$ corresponds to the pair $(ij)$ and $\\beta$ to $(kl)$. For $(ij)=(22)$, the Voigt index is $\\alpha=2$. For $(kl)=(22)$, the Voigt index is $\\beta=2$. Therefore, $S_{2222} = S_{22}$.\nFrom our calculated compliance matrix, we have $S_{22} = -1/50$ GPa$^{-1}$.\n$$\n\\frac{1}{E(\\mathbf{e}_2)} = -\\frac{1}{50} \\text{ GPa}^{-1}.\n$$\nInverting this expression gives the Young's modulus along the $\\mathbf{e}_2$ direction:\n$$\nE(\\mathbf{e}_2) = -50 \\text{ GPa}.\n$$\nThe value rounded to three significant figures is $-50.0$ GPa.\n\nFinally, we must explain the physical meaning of this negative Young's modulus. The Young's modulus $E = \\sigma/\\varepsilon$ characterizes the stiffness of a material in tension or compression. A positive value, which is observed for all stable materials, signifies that a tensile stress ($\\sigma>0$) induces an elongation ($\\varepsilon>0$), and a compressive stress ($\\sigma0$) induces a contraction ($\\varepsilon0$). A negative Young's modulus, such as $E(\\mathbf{e}_2) = -50$ GPa, implies the opposite: a tensile stress would cause the material to contract, and a compressive stress would cause it to expand. This behavior is indicative of a profound mechanical instability. Any perturbation would lead to a runaway deformation, causing the material to either implode under tension or explode under compression, as such deformation would release stored energy. This is a violation of thermodynamic stability. The fundamental condition for stability is that the strain-energy density, $U = \\frac{1}{2} \\varepsilon_{ij} C_{ijkl} \\varepsilon_{kl}$, must be a positive definite quadratic form. For a simple uniaxial strain $\\varepsilon_{22}$ along the $\\mathbf{e}_2$ axis, the energy density is $U = \\frac{1}{2} C_{2222} \\varepsilon_{22}^2$. Given $C_{2222} = C_{22} = -50$ GPa, the energy density becomes $U = -25 \\varepsilon_{22}^2$, which is negative for any nonzero strain $\\varepsilon_{22}$. This confirms that the state of zero strain is an unstable equilibrium (an energy maximum), and the negative Young's modulus is a direct physical consequence of this violation of the positive definiteness condition for the stiffness tensor.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{-50.0}\n$$", "id": "2769815"}, {"introduction": "For a stable, anisotropic crystal, mechanical properties such as the shear modulus are not single values but depend critically on orientation.

It presents a standard problem in the mechanics of crystalline solids: the determination of elastic constants from acoustic wave speed measurements. The provided data and physical framework are consistent with established principles of continuum mechanics and crystal physics. We may proceed with the solution.\n\nThe task is to determine the three independent elastic stiffness constants of a cubic crystal, $C_{11}$, $C_{12}$, and $C_{44}$, by solving a linear least-squares problem constructed from ultrasonic velocity measurements.\n\nThe derivation must begin from first principles, as stipulated. The governing equations are the linear elastic constitutive law and the equation of motion. In the absence of body forces, the equation of motion is:\n$$\n\\rho \\frac{\\partial^2 u_i}{\\partial t^2} = \\frac{\\partial \\sigma_{ij}}{\\partial x_j}\n$$\nwhere $\\rho$ is the mass density, $u_i(\\mathbf{x}, t)$ is the displacement vector field, and $\\sigma_{ij}$ is the Cauchy stress tensor. The stress is related to the strain $\\varepsilon_{kl} = \\frac{1}{2}(\\partial_k u_l + \\partial_l u_k)$ through the generalized Hooke's law:\n$$\n\\sigma_{ij} = C_{ijkl} \\varepsilon_{kl}\n$$\nwhere $C_{ijkl}$ is the fourth-rank stiffness tensor.\n\nWe seek a plane-wave solution of the form:\n$$\nu_i(\\mathbf{x}, t) = U_i \\exp[i(k n_j x_j - \\omega t)]\n$$\nHere, $U_i$ is the constant polarization vector, $k$ is the wave number, $\\mathbf{n}$ is the unit vector in the direction of propagation, and $\\omega$ is the angular frequency. The phase velocity is $v = \\omega/k$.\n\nSubstituting the plane-wave ansatz into the equation of motion yields the Christoffel equation. First, we compute the derivatives:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial u_i}{\\partial t} = -i\\omega U_i \\exp(\\dots) \\implies \\frac{\\partial^2 u_i}{\\partial t^2} = -\\omega^2 U_i \\exp(\\dots)\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial u_k}{\\partial x_l} = ik n_l U_k \\exp(\\dots) \\implies \\varepsilon_{kl} = \\frac{1}{2} (ik n_l U_k + ik n_k U_l) \\exp(\\dots)\n$$\n$$\n\\sigma_{ij} = C_{ijkl} \\frac{i k}{2} (n_l U_k + n_k U_l) \\exp(\\dots)\n$$\nUsing the major symmetries of the stiffness tensor ($C_{ijkl} = C_{ijlk}$), this simplifies to:\n$$\n\\sigma_{ij} = i k C_{ijkl} n_l U_k \\exp(\\dots)\n$$\nThen, the divergence of stress becomes:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial \\sigma_{ij}}{\\partial x_j} = (i k n_j) (i k C_{ijkl} n_l U_k) \\exp(\\dots) = -k^2 C_{ijkl} n_j n_l U_k \\exp(\\dots)\n$$\nSubstituting these back into the equation of motion:\n$$\n\\rho (-\\omega^2 U_i) \\exp(\\dots) = -k^2 C_{ijkl} n_j n_l U_k \\exp(\\dots)\n$$\nCanceling common terms and rearranging gives:\n$$\n(C_{ijkl} n_j n_l) U_k = \\rho \\frac{\\omega^2}{k^2} U_i = \\rho v^2 U_i\n$$\nThis is the Christoffel eigenvalue equation, $\\Gamma_{ik} U_k = \\rho v^2 U_i$, where the Christoffel matrix $\\Gamma_{ik}$ is defined as $\\Gamma_{ik} = C_{ijkl} n_j n_l$. The eigenvalues $\\lambda = \\rho v^2$ yield the phase velocities of the three possible wave modes for a given propagation direction $\\mathbf{n}$.\n\nFor a cubic crystal, the stiffness tensor $C_{ijkl}$ has only three independent components: $C_{1111}=C_{11}$, $C_{1122}=C_{12}$, and $C_{2323}=C_{44}$ (in Voigt notation). The components of the Christoffel matrix $\\Gamma_{ik}$ for a general propagation direction $\\mathbf{n}=(n_1, n_2, n_3)$ are:\n$$\n\\Gamma_{11} = C_{11} n_1^2 + C_{44} (n_2^2 + n_3^2) = (C_{11}-C_{44})n_1^2 + C_{44} \\\\\n\\Gamma_{22} = C_{11} n_2^2 + C_{44} (n_1^2 + n_3^2) = (C_{11}-C_{44})n_2^2 + C_{44} \\\\\n\\Gamma_{33} = C_{11} n_3^2 + C_{44} (n_1^2 + n_2^2) = (C_{11}-C_{44})n_3^2 + C_{44} \\\\\n\\Gamma_{12} = \\Gamma_{21} = (C_{12} + C_{44}) n_1 n_2 \\\\\n\\Gamma_{13} = \\Gamma_{31} = (C_{12} + C_{44}) n_1 n_3 \\\\\n\\Gamma_{23} = \\Gamma_{32} = (C_{12} + C_{44}) n_2 n_3\n$$\nWe now evaluate this matrix for the specified high-symmetry directions.\n\n1.  Direction $\\mathbf{n} = [100]$, so $n_1=1, n_2=0, n_3=0$.\nThe Christoffel matrix becomes diagonal:\n$$\n\\Gamma = \\begin{pmatrix} C_{11}  0  0 \\\\ 0  C_{44}  0 \\\\ 0  0  C_{44} \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe eigenvalues $\\lambda = \\rho v^2$ are $C_{11}$ and $C_{44}$ (doubly degenerate).\n-   $\\rho v_L^2 = C_{11}$: This corresponds to the longitudinal mode ($L$) with polarization $\\mathbf{U} || [100]$.\n-   $\\rho v_T^2 = C_{44}$: This corresponds to the two degenerate transverse modes ($T$) with polarizations in the plane orthogonal to $[100]$.\nThis yields two linear equations:\n-   $[100], L$: $C_{11} = \\rho v^2$\n-   $[100], T$: $C_{44} = \\rho v^2$\n\n2.  Direction $\\mathbf{n} = [110]$, so $n_1 = 1/\\sqrt{2}, n_2 = 1/\\sqrt{2}, n_3=0$.\nThe Christoffel matrix is:\n$$\n\\Gamma = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{1}{2}(C_{11}+C_{44})  \\frac{1}{2}(C_{12}+C_{44})  0 \\\\ \\frac{1}{2}(C_{12}+C_{44})  \\frac{1}{2}(C_{11}+C_{44})  0 \\\\ 0  0  C_{44} \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nOne eigenvalue is immediately read off: $\\lambda_1 = C_{44}$. The corresponding eigenvector is $[001]$, which is transverse to $[110]$. This is the $T2$ mode.\n-   $\\rho v_{T2}^2 = C_{44}$: This is the transverse mode $T2$ with polarization $\\mathbf{U} || [001]$.\nThe other two eigenvalues are found from the upper-left $2 \\times 2$ block:\n$$\n\\lambda_{2,3} = \\frac{1}{2}(C_{11}+C_{44}) \\pm \\frac{1}{2}(C_{12}+C_{44})\n$$\n-   $\\lambda_L = \\frac{1}{2}(C_{11}+C_{12}+2C_{44})$. The eigenvector is parallel to $[110]$. This is the longitudinal mode ($L$). Thus, $\\rho v_L^2 = \\frac{1}{2} C_{11} + \\frac{1}{2} C_{12} + C_{44}$.\n-   $\\lambda_{T1} = \\frac{1}{2}(C_{11}-C_{12})$. The eigenvector is parallel to $[1\\bar{1}0]$. This is the transverse mode ($T1$). Thus, $\\rho v_{T1}^2 = \\frac{1}{2} C_{11} - \\frac{1}{2} C_{12}$.\nThis yields three linear equations:\n-   $[110], L$: $\\frac{1}{2} C_{11} + \\frac{1}{2} C_{12} + C_{44} = \\rho v^2$\n-   $[110], T1$: $\\frac{1}{2} C_{11} - \\frac{1}{2} C_{12} = \\rho v^2$\n-   $[110], T2$: $C_{44} = \\rho v^2$\n\n3.  Direction $\\mathbf{n} = [111]$, so $n_1 = n_2 = n_3 = 1/\\sqrt{3}$.\nThe Christoffel matrix is symmetric with equal diagonal and equal off-diagonal elements:\n$$\n\\Gamma = \\frac{1}{3} \\begin{pmatrix} C_{11}+2C_{44}  C_{12}+C_{44}  C_{12}+C_{44} \\\\ C_{12}+C_{44}  C_{11}+2C_{44}  C_{12}+C_{44} \\\\ C_{12}+C_{44}  C_{12}+C_{44}  C_{11}+2C_{44} \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe eigenvalues are $\\lambda_L = \\frac{1}{3}(C_{11}+2C_{12}+4C_{44})$ (longitudinal mode, eigenvector parallel to $[111]$) and a degenerate eigenvalue $\\lambda_T = \\frac{1}{3}(C_{11}-C_{12}+C_{44})$ (transverse modes, eigenvectors in the plane orthogonal to $[111]$).\nThis yields two linear equations:\n-   $[111], L$: $\\frac{1}{3} C_{11} + \\frac{2}{3} C_{12} + \\frac{4}{3} C_{44} = \\rho v^2$\n-   $[111], T$: $\\frac{1}{3} C_{11} - \\frac{1}{3} C_{12} + \\frac{1}{3} C_{44} = \\rho v^2$\n\nWe can now construct a linear system $A \\mathbf{x} = \\mathbf{y}$ for the unknown vector $\\mathbf{x} = [C_{11}, C_{12}, C_{44}]^T$. For each measurement $m$ of velocity $v_m$ for a given direction and mode, we have a row in the matrix $A$ and a corresponding entry in the vector $\\mathbf{y}$. Let $y_m = \\rho v_m^2$. The coefficients $(a_m, b_m, c_m)$ for the equation $a_m C_{11} + b_m C_{12} + c_m C_{44} = y_m$ are:\n-   $([100], L)$: $(1, 0, 0)$\n-   $([100], T)$: $(0, 0, 1)$\n-   $([110], L)$: $(1/2, 1/2, 1)$\n-   $([110], T1)$: $(1/2, -1/2, 0)$\n-   $([110], T2)$: $(0, 0, 1)$\n-   $([111], L)$: $(1/3, 2/3, 4/3)$\n-   $([111], T)$: $(1/3, -1/3, 1/3)$\n\nFor each test case, we assemble the matrix $A$ and vector $\\mathbf{y}$ from the provided measurements. Since the system may be overdetermined, we solve for $\\mathbf{x}$ in the least-squares sense, minimizing the Euclidean norm of the residual, $\\|A\\mathbf{x} - \\mathbf{y}\\|_2$. A numerically stable method for this is to use Singular Value Decomposition (SVD), as implemented in `numpy.linalg.lstsq`. The solution vector $\\mathbf{x}$ provides the estimates for $(C_{11}, C_{12}, C_{44})$ in Pascals. These are converted to Gigapascals (GPa) by dividing by $10^9$ and rounding to three decimal places as required.
