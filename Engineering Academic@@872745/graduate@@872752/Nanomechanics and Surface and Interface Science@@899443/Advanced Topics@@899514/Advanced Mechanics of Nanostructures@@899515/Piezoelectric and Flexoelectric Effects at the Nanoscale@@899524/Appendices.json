The analysis will proceed by applying the constraints imposed by the group's generators on the tensor components. The starting point is the transformation law for a third-rank polar tensor under an orthogonal transformation $a_{ij}$:\n$$d'_{ijk} = a_{ip}a_{jq}a_{kr}d_{pqr}$$\nFor a symmetry operation of the crystal, invariance requires $d'_{ijk}=d_{ijk}$. We are also given that the tensor is symmetric in its last two indices, $d_{ijk}=d_{ikj}$.\n\nFirst, we apply the constraint from a right-handed rotation by $\\frac{\\pi}{2}$ about the $\\hat{\\boldsymbol{z}}$-axis, represented by the matrix:\n$$a^{(C_{4})}=\\begin{pmatrix} 0 & -1 & 0\\\\ 1 & \\phantom{-}0 & 0\\\\ 0 & \\phantom{-}0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$$\nThe non-zero elements are $a_{12}=-1$, $a_{21}=1$, and $a_{33}=1$. The invariance condition $d_{ijk} = a_{ip}a_{jq}a_{kr}d_{pqr}$ yields a set of equations. We evaluate these for various components $(i,j,k)$.\n\nFor example, for the component $d_{111}$:\n$d_{111} = a_{1p}a_{1q}a_{1r}d_{pqr} = a_{12}a_{12}a_{12}d_{222} = (-1)^3 d_{222} = -d_{222}$.\nAnd for $d_{222}$:\n$d_{222} = a_{2p}a_{2q}a_{2r}d_{pqr} = a_{21}a_{21}a_{21}d_{111} = (1)^3 d_{111} = d_{111}$.\nCombining $d_{111}=-d_{222}$ and $d_{222}=d_{111}$ implies $d_{111}=-d_{111}$, hence $d_{111}=0$ and consequently $d_{222}=0$.\n\nA systematic application of this procedure for all unique components considering the symmetry $d_{ijk}=d_{ikj}$ yields the following constraints from the $C_4$ rotation:\n1.  Components that are zero:\n    $d_{111}=d_{222}=0$.\n    $d_{122}=d_{211}=0$. The transformation gives $d_{122}=-d_{211}$ and $d_{211}=d_{122}$, which forces both to zero.\n    $d_{112}=d_{221}=0$. Using $d_{ijk}=d_{ikj}$, this also means $d_{121}=d_{212}=0$.\n    $d_{133}=d_{233}=0$. The transformation gives $d_{133}=-d_{233}$ and $d_{233}=d_{133}$, forcing both to zero.\n    $d_{313}=d_{323}=0$. Transformation gives $d_{313}=-d_{323}$ and $d_{323}=d_{313}$. This implies $d_{313}=d_{323}=0$. By index symmetry, $d_{331}=d_{332}=0$.\n    $d_{312}=0$. Transformation gives $d_{312}=-d_{321}$.

Factor is $(1)(1)(1)=1$. Invariant.\n$d_{322}$: The indices $(3,2,2)$ contain two $2$s. Factor is $(1)(-1)(-1)=1$. Invariant. The relation $d_{311}=d_{322}$ is preserved.\n$d_{333}$: No index $2$. Invariant.\n$d_{131}$: No index $2$. Invariant.\n$d_{232}$: Two indices $2$. Factor is $(-1)(1)(-1)=1$. Invariant. The relation $d_{131}=d_{232}$ is preserved.\n$d_{123}$: One index $2$. Factor is $(1)(-1)(1)=-1$. The condition is $d_{123}=-d_{123}$, which implies $d_{123}=0$.\n$d_{213}$: One index $2$. Factor is $(-1)(1)(1)=-1$. The condition is $d_{213}=-d_{213}$, which implies $d_{213}=0$. This is consistent with $d_{123}=0$ and the $C_4$ relation $d_{123}=-d_{213}$.\n\nAfter applying both symmetry operations, the final set of non-zero components is:\n$d_{131}=d_{113}$, $d_{232}=d_{223}$, $d_{311}$, $d_{322}$, $d_{333}$.\nSubject to the relations:\n$d_{311}=d_{322}$.\n$d_{131}=d_{232}$ (which is equivalent to $d_{113}=d_{223}$ via suffix symmetry).\n\nThere are $3$ independent non-zero piezoelectric coefficients. To represent this in matrix form, we use the Voigt notation where the pair of indices $(jk)$ is contracted to a single index $J$:\n$(11)\\to 1$, $(22)\\to 2$, $(33)\\to 3$, $(23)\\text{ or }(32)\\to 4$, $(13)\\text{ or }(31)\\to 5$, $(12)\\text{ or }(21)\\to 6$.\nThe tensor components $d_{ijk}$ map to the matrix components $d_{iJ}$.\n$d_{311} \\to d_{31}$\n$d_{322} \\to d_{32}$\n$d_{333} \\to d_{33}$\n$d_{113} \\to d_{15}$\n$d_{223} \\to d_{24}$\n\nThe relations between tensor components translate to relations between matrix elements:\n$d_{311}=d_{322} \\implies d_{31}=d_{32}$.\n$d_{113}=d_{223} \\implies d_{15}=d_{24}$.\n\nAll other components $d_{iJ}$ are zero. For example, $d_{36} \\leftrightarrow d_{312}$, which we found to be zero. $d_{14} \\leftrightarrow d_{123}$, also zero. We can now assemble the $3 \\times 6$ matrix $[d_{iJ}]$:\n$$[d_{iJ}] = \\begin{pmatrix} d_{11} & d_{12} & d_{13} & d_{14} & d_{15} & d_{16} \\\\ d_{21} & d_{22} & d_{23} & d_{24} & d_{25} & d_{26} \\\\ d_{31} & d_{32} & d_{33} & d_{34} & d_{35} & d_{36} \\end{pmatrix}$$\nSubstituting the non-zero components and the relations, we get:\n$$[d_{iJ}] = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & d_{15} & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 & d_{24} & 0 & 0 \\\\ d_{31} & d_{32} & d_{33} & 0 & 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & d_{15} & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 & d_{15} & 0 & 0 \\\\ d_{31} & d_{31} & d_{33} & 0 & 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$$\nThe three independent symbolic constants are conventionally denoted as $d_{15}$, $d_{31}$, and $d_{33}$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & d_{15} & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 & d_{15} & 0 & 0 \\\\ d_{31} & d_{31} & d_{33} & 0 & 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}}$$", "id": "2783846"}, {"introduction": "Beyond identifying the allowed tensor components, a crucial skill is to quantitatively estimate the magnitude of electromechanical effects in realistic scenarios.

Under a DC bias, oxygen vacancies can drift and redistribute, changing the local lattice parameter via the Vegard effect (strain per unit fractional concentration change) and producing an out-of-plane surface displacement that can mimic a piezoelectric signal. At the same time, any truly elastic electromechanical response (piezoelectric and/or flexoelectric) is expected to be essentially instantaneous on experimental timescales far below the contact resonance and not governed by diffusive kinetics.\n\nConsider a film with the following properties at room temperature: thickness $L = 40\\,\\mathrm{nm}$, oxygen vacancy diffusion coefficient $D_{v} = 1.0 \\times 10^{-16}\\,\\mathrm{m^{2}\\,s^{-1}}$, and Vegard coefficient $\\beta = 0.02$ (dimensionless).

This is a phonon-mediated process, occurring on timescales of lattice vibrations, which are typically in the order of $10^{-13}\\,\\mathrm{s}$ to $10^{-12}\\,\\mathrm{s}$. For the AC frequencies used in PFM (typically $\\mathrm{Hz}$ to $\\mathrm{MHz}$ range), which are far below the material's optical phonon frequencies and the AFM's contact resonance $f_c$, this response can be considered instantaneous and frequency-independent. The amplitude of this response is, to a first approximation, linear with the applied AC voltage $V_{\\mathrm{ac}}$.\n\n2.  **Ionic Response (Vacancy Migration)**: This response is governed by the drift and diffusion of charged defects, in this case, oxygen vacancies. Such a process is described by transport equations (e.g., the Nernst-Planck equation). The characteristic time, $\\tau$, for vacancies to diffuse across a characteristic length scale, such as the film thickness $L$, is given by the dimensional relation derived from the diffusion equation, $\\frac{\\partial c}{\\partial t} = D \\nabla^2 c$. This time scales as:\n    $$ \\tau \\approx \\frac{L^2}{D_{v}} $$\n    The characteristic frequency, $f_{knee}$, associated with this relaxation process is the inverse of this characteristic time:\n    $$ f_{knee} \\approx \\frac{1}{\\tau} \\approx \\frac{D_{v}}{L^2} $$\n    At driving frequencies $f \\ll f_{knee}$, the vacancies have sufficient time to move in response to the field, contributing to the measured displacement. At frequencies $f \\gg f_{knee}$, the vacancies are too slow to follow the oscillating field and are effectively immobile, so their contribution to the AC response vanishes. This behavior is characteristic of a low-pass filter or a Debye-like relaxation.\n\n**Calculation of Characteristic Time and Frequency**\nUsing the given parameters:\n- $L = 40\\,\\mathrm{nm} = 4 \\times 10^{-8}\\,\\mathrm{m}$\n- $D_{v} = 1.0 \\times 10^{-16}\\,\\mathrm{m^{2}\\,s^{-1}}$\n\nThe characteristic time is:\n$$ \\tau \\approx \\frac{(4 \\times 10^{-8}\\,\\mathrm{m})^2}{1.0 \\times 10^{-16}\\,\\mathrm{m^{2}\\,s^{-1}}} = \\frac{16 \\times 10^{-16}\\,\\mathrm{m^2}}{1.0 \\times 10^{-16}\\,\\mathrm{m^{2}\\,s^{-1}}} = 16\\,\\mathrm{s} $$\nThe characteristic frequency is:\n$$ f_{knee} \\approx \\frac{1}{\\tau} = \\frac{1}{16\\,\\mathrm{s}} = 0.0625\\,\\mathrm{Hz} $$\nThis calculated frequency is on the order of $10^{-1}\\,\\mathrm{Hz}$ (as $0.01 < 0.0625 < 0.1$).\n\n**Evaluation of Options**\n\n**A. Sweep the PFM AC drive frequency $f$ from $0.01\\,\\mathrm{Hz}$ to $100\\,\\mathrm{Hz}$...**\nThis option proposes a frequency-domain spectroscopy measurement.\n- **Elastic Response**: The statement that a purely elastic response will have a frequency-independent amplitude and a phase near zero (in-phase with the drive) is correct, as this response is effectively instantaneous on these timescales.\n- **Ionic Response**: The statement that an ionic contribution will exhibit a low-pass roll-off in amplitude and an increasing phase lag is the correct description of a relaxation process. The vacancies can follow the field at low frequencies but not at high frequencies.\n- **Knee Frequency**: The option predicts a knee frequency of order $10^{-1}\\,\\mathrm{Hz}$. Our calculation yields $f_{knee} \\approx 0.0625\\,\\mathrm{Hz}$, which is indeed of order $10^{-1}\\,\\mathrm{Hz}$. The proposed frequency sweep range from $0.01\\,\\mathrm{Hz}$ to $100\\,\\mathrm{Hz}$ is perfectly suited to observe this transition, as it spans frequencies both below and above the calculated $f_{knee}$.\nTherefore, this protocol is a standard and scientifically sound method for distinguishing the two contributions.\n\n**B. At fixed frequency $f = 10\\,\\mathrm{kHz}$, ramp the AC amplitude $V_{\\mathrm{ac}}$ from $0.1\\,\\mathrm{V}$ to $3\\,\\mathrm{V}$ and monitor the PFM amplitude nonlinearity...**\nThis option proposes an amplitude sweep at a single, high frequency.\n- The chosen frequency $f = 10\\,\\mathrm{kHz}$ is much greater than the calculated ionic knee frequency ($10000\\,\\mathrm{Hz} \\gg 0.0625\\,\\mathrm{Hz}$). At this frequency, the contribution from oxygen vacancy migration to the AC signal will be negligible, as the ions are too slow to respond. The measurement would therefore be sensitive almost exclusively to the elastic response.\n- The claim that nonlinearity is a unique signature of an ionic response is incorrect. In ferroelectric materials (a common class of perovskites exhibiting piezoelectricity), large AC voltages can induce domain wall motion and switching, which results in a highly nonlinear and hysteretic amplitude response. Therefore, observing nonlinearity at large $V_{\\mathrm{ac}}$ does not distinguish an ionic mechanism from a ferroelectric elastic mechanism. Conversely, the absence of nonlinearity would not rule out the presence of ions, it would only indicate that the dominant response at this high frequency is linear.\nThis protocol is fundamentally flawed as it cannot reliably separate the two mechanisms.\n\n**C. Apply a DC step $V_{0}$ for a dwell time $t_{d} \\gg 1\\,\\mathrm{s}$, then set $V_{\\mathrm{dc}}$ back to zero and monitor the off-field PFM amplitude...**\nThis option proposes a time-domain relaxation measurement.\n- **Protocol Logic**: Applying a DC bias for a sufficiently long time ($t_d$) allows the mobile ions to redistribute, creating a quasi-static strain state. For significant redistribution, $t_{d}$ must be comparable to or longer than the characteristic diffusion time, $\\tau$. Upon removal of the DC bias, this ionically-induced strain will relax back to equilibrium via diffusion. This relaxation is a slow process governed by $\\tau$. The purely elastic response, in contrast, vanishes instantaneously with the removal of the field and has no such \"memory\" or slow relaxation. Monitoring the PFM signal after removing the DC bias is thus a direct probe of this slow relaxation.\n- **Time Scale**: The option suggests a relaxation time \"on the order of a few seconds\". Our calculation yields $\\tau \\approx 16\\,\\mathrm{s}$. The value $16\\,\\mathrm{s}$ qualifies as being \"on the order of a few seconds\" in the context of distinguishing it from an instantaneous elastic effect. More importantly, it is a slow, measurable relaxation. The condition $t_{d} \\gg 1\\,\\mathrm{s}$ is consistent with needing a dwell time on the order of $\\tau$ to induce the effect in the first place.\nThis protocol correctly utilizes the different temporal \"memory\" of the two mechanisms and is scientifically sound.\n\n**D. At fixed frequency $f = 30\\,\\mathrm{kHz}$ and fixed $V_{\\mathrm{ac}}$, increase the tip load (normal force) by a factor of $2$ and monitor the increase in PFM amplitude...**\nThis option proposes investigating the dependence on mechanical load.\n- The claim is that an ionic response is indicated by a larger amplitude at larger load, while an elastic response is load-independent.\n- This premise is fundamentally incorrect. The elastic PFM signal is **not** generally load-independent. The magnitude of the piezoelectric response depends on the quality of the electrical and mechanical contact, which changes with load. More significantly, the flexoelectric effect is a response to a strain gradient. The strain gradient beneath an AFM tip is a strong function of the contact mechanics (Hertzian or otherwise) and thus is highly dependent on the applied load. Therefore, a load-dependent signal is expected for the elastic response itself, especially if flexoelectricity is present.\n- The effect of load on the ionic response is also complex, potentially altering diffusion barriers or contact potentials, and cannot be assumed a priori to simply increase with load.\nBecause the premise regarding the load-independence of the elastic signal is false, this protocol does not provide an unambiguous method for distinguishing the two contributions.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{AC}$$", "id": "2783893"}]}
