It is a well-posed problem in solid-state physics, grounded in established scientific principles, with sufficient and consistent data for a unique solution. We may proceed with the derivation.\n\nThe tracer self-diffusion coefficient, $D_T$, is derived by combining three fundamental concepts: the equilibrium concentration of point defects, the rate of atomic jumps via transition-state theory, and the random-walk model of diffusion.\n\nFirst, we determine the equilibrium concentration of vacancies, $X_v$. The formation of a vacancy changes the Gibbs free energy of the crystal. The Gibbs free energy of formation is $G_f = E_f - T S_f$, where $E_f$ is the vacancy formation energy and $S_f$ is the vacancy formation entropy. The problem specifies that the formation entropy contribution is negligible, which simplifies the free energy to $G_f \\approx E_f$. The equilibrium fraction of vacant lattice sites, $X_v$, is given by the Boltzmann factor for creating a defect:\n$$X_v = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{G_f}{k_B T}\\right) \\approx \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_f}{k_B T}\\right)$$\nHere, $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant and $T$ is the absolute temperature. This expression is valid for a dilute concentration of vacancies, $X_v \\ll 1$, an assumption given in the problem.\n\nSecond, we formulate the rate of atomic jumps. An atom can diffuse only if an adjacent lattice site is vacant. The rate at which a specific atom jumps into a specific neighboring vacancy is given by transition-state theory. This jump rate, $\\omega$, is characterized by an activation energy barrier, the migration energy $E_m$, and an attempt frequency, $\\nu$.\n$$\\omega = \\nu \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_m}{k_B T}\\right)$$\nThe total jump frequency of a tracer atom, $\\Gamma_T$, is the product of this intrinsic jump rate, $\\omega$, and the probability that a neighboring site is vacant. For a face-centered cubic (FCC) lattice, each atom has $z=12$ nearest neighbors. In the dilute limit, the probability of finding a vacancy at any one of the $z$ neighboring sites is $z X_v$. Therefore, the total jump frequency for a tracer atom is:\n$$\\Gamma_T = z X_v \\omega$$\nSubstituting the expressions for $X_v$ and $\\omega$:\n$$\\Gamma_T = z \\nu \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_f}{k_B T}\\right) \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_m}{k_B T}\\right) = z \\nu \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_f + E_m}{k_B T}\\right)$$\n\nThird, we use the Einstein relation for diffusion in a three-dimensional crystal lattice. The diffusion coefficient, $D$, is related to the mean squared jump distance, $d^2$, and the jump frequency, $\\Gamma$, by:\n$$D = \\frac{1}{6} \\Gamma d^2$$\nFor tracer diffusion, we must account for the fact that successive jumps of an atom via the vacancy mechanism are not independent. A tracer atom that has just exchanged with a vacancy has a higher-than-random probability of jumping back into the same vacancy. This correlation reduces the net displacement. The effect is quantified by the correlation factor, $f$. The tracer self-diffusion coefficient $D_T$ is thus:\n$$D_T = \\frac{1}{6} f \\Gamma_T d^2$$\n\nFor the FCC lattice, the nearest-neighbor jump distance $d$ is half the diagonal of a face of the conventional cubic cell. This relates $d$ to the lattice parameter $a$ as $d = a/\\sqrt{2}$. Consequently, $d^2 = a^2/2$.\nSubstituting the expressions for $\\Gamma_T$ and $d^2$ into the equation for $D_T$:\n$$D_T = \\frac{1}{6} f \\left( z \\nu \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_f + E_m}{k_B T}\\right) \\right) \\left( \\frac{a^2}{2} \\right)$$\nWith $z=12$ for the FCC lattice, we simplify the expression:\n$$D_T = \\frac{1}{6} f (12) \\nu \\frac{a^2}{2} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_f + E_m}{k_B T}\\right)$$\n$$D_T = f \\nu a^2 \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_f + E_m}{k_B T}\\right)$$\nThis is the final analytical expression for the tracer self-diffusion coefficient. It is of the Arrhenius form $D_T = D_0 \\exp(-Q/k_B T)$, with a pre-exponential factor $D_0 = f \\nu a^2$ and an activation energy for diffusion $Q = E_f + E_m$.\n\nWe now evaluate this expression numerically using the provided parameters:\n- Correlation factor: $f = 0.78$\n- Attempt frequency: $\\nu = 10^{13} \\ \\mathrm{s^{-1}}$\n- Lattice parameter: $a = 0.36 \\ \\mathrm{nm} = 0.36 \\times 10^{-9} \\ \\mathrm{m}$\n- Vacancy formation energy: $E_f = 1.2 \\ \\mathrm{eV}$\n- Vacancy migration energy: $E_m = 0.7 \\ \\mathrm{eV}$\n- Temperature: $T = 1000 \\ \\mathrm{K}$\n- Boltzmann constant: $k_B = 8.617333262 \\times 10^{-5} \\ \\mathrm{eV\\,K^{-1}}$\n\nFirst, calculate the total activation energy $Q$:\n$$Q = E_f + E_m = 1.2 \\ \\mathrm{eV} + 0.7 \\ \\mathrm{eV} = 1.9 \\ \\mathrm{eV}$$\nNext, calculate the thermal energy $k_B T$:\n$$k_B T = (8.617333262 \\times 10^{-5} \\ \\mathrm{eV\\,K^{-1}}) \\times (1000 \\ \\mathrm{K}) \\approx 0.086173 \\ \\mathrm{eV}$$\nNow, compute the exponential term:\n$$\\frac{Q}{k_B T} = \\frac{1.9 \\ \\mathrm{eV}}{0.086173 \\ \\mathrm{eV}} \\approx 22.048$$\n$$\\exp\\left(-\\frac{Q}{k_B T}\\right) = \\exp(-22.048) \\approx 2.405 \\times 10^{-10}$$\nNext, calculate the pre-exponential factor $D_0$:\n$$D_0 = f \\nu a^2 = (0.78) \\times (10^{13} \\ \\mathrm{s^{-1}}) \\times (0.36 \\times 10^{-9} \\ \\mathrm{m})^2$$\n$$D_0 = (0.78) \\times (10^{13} \\ \\mathrm{s^{-1}}) \\times (1.296 \\times 10^{-19} \\ \\mathrm{m^2})$$\n$$D_0 \\approx 1.011 \\times 10^{-6} \\ \\mathrm{m^2\\,s^{-1}}$$\nFinally, combine these results to find $D_T$:\n$$D_T = D_0 \\exp\\left(-\\frac{Q}{k_B T}\\right) \\approx (1.011 \\times 10^{-6} \\ \\mathrm{m^2\\,s^{-1}}) \\times (2.405 \\times 10^{-10})$$\n$$D_T \\approx 2.431 \\times 10^{-16} \\ \\mathrm{m^2\\,s^{-1}}$$\nRounding the result to $3$ significant figures as requested gives:\n$$D_T = 2.43 \\times 10^{-16} \\ \\mathrm{m^2\\,s^{-1}}$$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{2.43 \\times 10^{-16}}$$", "id": "2784728"}, {"introduction": "While the random walk is a powerful model for diffusion, the movement of a tracer atom via the vacancy mechanism is not truly random.

Moreover, the nearest-neighbor displacement length per successful atom–vacancy exchange, denoted by $l$, is engineered to be identical across the three lattices by appropriate choice of lattice parameter. Under these conditions, the net rate of successful atom–vacancy exchanges per atom, denoted by $\\Gamma_{0}$, is experimentally found to be the same for the three specimens.\n\nStarting from the definition of the diffusion coefficient in terms of the long-time limit of the mean-squared displacement and the continuous-time random walk model, explain physically why the tracer correlation factor $f$ for vacancy-mediated diffusion satisfies $f1$, and why its value depends on lattice topology for face-centered cubic (fcc), body-centered cubic (bcc), and hexagonal close-packed (hcp) crystals.\n\nFor the purpose of quantifying the effect of the correlation factor alone, take the canonical monovacancy tracer correlation factors to be $f_{\\mathrm{fcc}}=0.7815$, $f_{\\mathrm{bcc}}=0.7272$, and, for in-plane (basal) displacements in an ideal hexagonal close-packed (hcp) crystal, $f_{\\mathrm{hcp,basal}}=0.7815$.

It will be addressed in three parts as requested: first, the physical origin of the correlation factor being less than unity; second, its dependence on lattice topology; and third, a quantitative comparison for the specified crystal structures.\n\nThe starting point is the definition of the tracer diffusion coefficient, $D_T^*$, derived from the long-time limit of the mean-squared displacement (MSD), $\\langle |\\vec{R}(t)|^2 \\rangle$, in a three-dimensional system:\n$$D_T^* = \\lim_{t \\to \\infty} \\frac{\\langle |\\vec{R}(t)|^2 \\rangle}{6t}$$\nIn the framework of a random walk on a lattice, the total displacement vector $\\vec{R}$ after $N$ jumps is the sum of the individual jump vectors $\\vec{r}_i$, $\\vec{R}(N) = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\vec{r}_i$. The MSD can be expanded as:\n$$\\langle |\\vec{R}(N)|^2 \\rangle = \\left\\langle \\left( \\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\vec{r}_i \\right) \\cdot \\left( \\sum_{j=1}^{N} \\vec{r}_j \\right) \\right\\rangle = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\langle |\\vec{r}_i|^2 \\rangle + 2 \\sum_{i=1}^{N-1} \\sum_{j=i+1}^{N} \\langle \\vec{r}_i \\cdot \\vec{r}_j \\rangle$$\nIf all jump vectors have the same length $l$, this becomes $\\langle |\\vec{R}(N)|^2 \\rangle = Nl^2 + 2l^2 \\sum_{ij} \\langle \\cos\\theta_{ij} \\rangle$, where $\\theta_{ij}$ is the angle between jump $i$ and jump $j$. For a truly random walk, successive jumps are uncorrelated, meaning $\\langle \\cos\\theta_{ij} \\rangle = 0$ for $i \\neq j$. The MSD for an uncorrelated walk is $\\langle |\\vec{R}(N)|^2 \\rangle_{\\text{random}} = Nl^2$. The number of jumps in time $t$ is $N = \\Gamma t$, where $\\Gamma$ is the jump rate. The diffusion coefficient for this uncorrelated walk would be $D_{\\text{random}} = \\frac{\\Gamma l^2}{6}$.\n\nThe first part of the problem asks why the tracer correlation factor $f$ is less than $1$. In vacancy-mediated diffusion, a tracer atom moves by exchanging its position with a neighboring vacancy. After the tracer atom completes its first jump, $\\vec{r}_1$, into the vacancy, the vacancy now occupies the site just abandoned by the tracer. For the tracer atom to make its next jump, it must again exchange with a vacancy. The probability that the vacancy involved in the first jump is still adjacent to the tracer atom is nearly $1$. The probability of finding a different vacancy at any other specific neighboring site is equal to the equilibrium vacancy concentration, $X_v$, which is a very small number (e.g., $X_v \\sim 10^{-4}$ even near the melting point). Consequently, there is a very high probability that the tracer atom's next jump, $\\vec{r}_2$, will be a reversal of the first, i.e., $\\vec{r}_2 = -\\vec{r}_1$, as the atom jumps back into the same vacancy. This introduces a strong negative correlation between consecutive jumps, meaning the average value $\\langle \\vec{r}_1 \\cdot \\vec{r}_2 \\rangle$ is negative. This negative correlation reduces the net displacement over many jumps. The actual MSD is thus smaller than the MSD for a purely random walk. The correlation factor $f$ is defined to quantify this reduction:\n$$D_T^* = f \\cdot D_{\\text{random}} = f \\left( \\frac{\\Gamma l^2}{6} \\right)$$\nSince the correlation between successive jumps is predominantly negative, this necessarily reduces the effectiveness of the random walk in producing a net displacement, and thus, the correlation factor $f$ must be less than $1$.\n\nThe second part of the problem asks why $f$ depends on lattice topology. The magnitude of the correlation is determined by the probability of a reverse jump. This probability, in turn, is controlled by the rate at which the vacancy, after its exchange with the tracer, migrates away from the tracer atom. If the vacancy can easily diffuse away, the \"memory\" of the initial jump direction is lost more quickly, and the walk becomes more random, leading to a value of $f$ closer to $1$. The efficiency of the vacancy's escape is a direct function of the lattice geometry, specifically the coordination number $z$ (the number of nearest neighbors) and the connectivity of the lattice sites.\nFor example, in a face-centered cubic (fcc) lattice ($z=12$), any two nearest-neighbor sites share $4$ common nearest neighbors. After a tracer-vacancy exchange, if the vacancy jumps to one of these $4$ shared sites, it is still a nearest neighbor to the tracer atom, keeping the probability of a reverse tracer jump high.\nIn contrast, in a body-centered cubic (bcc) lattice ($z=8$), any two nearest-neighbor sites share $0$ common nearest neighbors. This means that if the vacancy makes a single jump to any site other than the one occupied by the tracer atom, it is no longer a nearest neighbor of that tracer. The probability of the vacancy returning to induce a reverse tracer jump is thereby significantly reduced compared to the fcc case.\nThe hexagonal close-packed (hcp) crystal has an anisotropic structure. While its coordination number is also $z=12$, the arrangement of neighbors is different from fcc, which leads to different jump probabilities in different crystallographic directions. This results in an anisotropic correlation factor (i.e., $f$ is a tensor). The fact that $f_{\\mathrm{hcp,basal}} = f_{\\mathrm{fcc}}$ is a known result stemming from the identical atomic arrangement within the close-packed planes of both structures.\nIn summary, because the number of escape routes for the vacancy and the probability of it remaining adjacent to the tracer depend critically on the coordination number and site connectivity, the correlation factor $f$ is a distinct property of each lattice topology.\n\nFor the final, quantitative part, the problem states that the diffusion coefficient $D$ is proportional to $f$ under the given conditions where the atom-vacancy exchange rate $\\Gamma_0$ and the jump length $l$ are fixed. This is consistent with the expression $D_T^* = \\frac{1}{6} \\Gamma_0 l^2 f$ for cubic lattices, where the term $\\frac{1}{6} \\Gamma_0 l^2$ serves as the constant of proportionality. We are asked to find the multiplicative factor by which the tracer diffusion coefficient in the fcc crystal, $D_{\\mathrm{fcc}}$, exceeds that in the bcc crystal, $D_{\\mathrm{bcc}}$. This factor is simply the ratio of their diffusion coefficients:\n$$ \\frac{D_{\\mathrm{fcc}}}{D_{\\mathrm{bcc}}} $$\nGiven the proportionality $D \\propto f$, the constant of proportionality cancels out in the ratio:\n$$ \\frac{D_{\\mathrm{fcc}}}{D_{\\mathrm{bcc}}} = \\frac{f_{\\mathrm{fcc}}}{f_{\\mathrm{bcc}}} $$\nWe substitute the given numerical values for the correlation factors: $f_{\\mathrm{fcc}} = 0.7815$ and $f_{\\mathrm{bcc}} = 0.7272$.\n$$ \\frac{D_{\\mathrm{fcc}}}{D_{\\mathrm{bcc}}} = \\frac{0.7815}{0.7272} \\approx 1.074669967 $$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to $4$ significant figures.
