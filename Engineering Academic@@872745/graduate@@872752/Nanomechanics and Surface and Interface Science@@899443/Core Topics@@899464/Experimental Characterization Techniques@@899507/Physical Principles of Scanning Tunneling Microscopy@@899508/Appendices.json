A rigorous analysis of each statement is now possible and required.\n\n**Derivation and Evaluation**\n\nFirst, we must calculate the decay constant $\\kappa$. The formula is $\\kappa = \\sqrt{2m\\Phi}/\\hbar$. Using the values for the electron mass $m \\approx 9.109 \\times 10^{-31}\\,\\mathrm{kg}$, the reduced Planck constant $\\hbar \\approx 1.054 \\times 10^{-34}\\,\\mathrm{J \\cdot s}$, and the barrier height $\\Phi = 4.0\\,\\mathrm{eV} \\approx 4.0 \\times 1.602 \\times 10^{-19}\\,\\mathrm{J}$:\n$$\n\\kappa = \\frac{\\sqrt{2 \\times (9.109 \\times 10^{-31}\\,\\mathrm{kg}) \\times (4.0 \\times 1.602 \\times 10^{-19}\\,\\mathrm{J})}}{1.054 \\times 10^{-34}\\,\\mathrm{J \\cdot s}} \\approx 1.025 \\times 10^{10}\\,\\mathrm{m^{-1}}\n$$\nThis is equivalent to $\\kappa \\approx 10.25\\,\\mathrm{nm^{-1}}$. For practical purposes, the approximation $\\kappa \\approx 10\\,\\mathrm{nm^{-1}}$ is reasonable. The characteristic length scale for current decay is $1/(2\\kappa) \\approx 1/(20.5\\,\\mathrm{nm^{-1}}) \\approx 0.049\\,\\mathrm{nm}$ or $49\\,\\mathrm{pm}$. This means the current changes by a factor of $e$ for every change in distance of approximately $49\\,\\mathrm{pm}$.\n\nNow, we evaluate each statement.\n\n**Option A Evaluation:**\nThe statement claims $\\kappa\\approx 10\\,\\mathrm{nm}^{-1}$, which our calculation confirms as a good approximation.\nThe surface has a peak-to-valley amplitude of $100\\,\\mathrm{pm}$, so the height deviation from the mean is $\\Delta h = \\pm 50\\,\\mathrm{pm}$. In constant-height mode, the tip-sample distance $z$ changes by $\\Delta z = \\mp 50\\,\\mathrm{pm}$. The current is $I(z) \\propto e^{-2\\kappa z}$. The change in current relative to the current at the mean height $I_{mean}$ is $I/I_{mean} = e^{-2\\kappa \\Delta z}$. For the peaks and valleys, $\\Delta z = \\mp 50\\,\\mathrm{pm} = \\mp 0.05\\,\\mathrm{nm}$.\nThe exponent is $-2\\kappa \\Delta z = -2(10.25\\,\\mathrm{nm^{-1}})(\\mp 0.05\\,\\mathrm{nm}) = \\pm 1.025$. So the current change factor is $e^{\\pm 1.025} \\approx e^{\\pm 1}$. This part is correct.\nThe peak-to-valley current ratio would be $I_{peak}/I_{valley} = e^{1.025} / e^{-1.025} = e^{2.05} \\approx 7.77$. The statement uses the phrasing \"valley-to-peak\" and gives a value of $e^2 \\approx 7.4$. Assuming \"peak-to-valley\" was intended, the value is acceptably close.\nNext, we analyze the noise from vertical vibrations. For small fluctuations $\\delta z$, the fractional current fluctuation is $\\delta I / I \\approx |d(\\ln I)/dz|\\, \\delta z = 2\\kappa\\,\\delta z$. The RMS fractional noise is $ (\\delta I / I)_{\\mathrm{rms}} = 2\\kappa\\,\\delta z_{\\mathrm{rms}} = 2(10.25\\,\\mathrm{nm^{-1}})(10\\,\\mathrm{pm}) = 2(10.25\\,\\mathrm{nm^{-1}})(0.01\\,\\mathrm{nm}) = 0.205$, or $20.5\\%$. The statement's approximation of $0.2$ ($20\\%$) is correct.\nThe current noise from vibrations is $\\delta I_{vib, \\mathrm{rms}} = I_0 \\times 0.205 = (1.0\\,\\mathrm{nA}) \\times 0.205 = 205\\,\\mathrm{pA}$. This value is much larger than the preamplifier noise $\\delta I_{\\mathrm{rms}} = 5\\,\\mathrm{pA}$. Thus, the statement that the vibration contribution exceeds the preamplifier contribution is correct.\nFinally, the description of the constant-current mode—that the feedback suppresses in-band current noise by adjusting $z$ and transferring disturbances to the height signal—is a correct qualitative description of the principle of operation.\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\n**Option B Evaluation:**\nThe statement analyzes the performance of the constant-current mode. The spatial period of the corrugation is $a=0.30\\,\\mathrm{nm}$. The scan speed is $v=300\\,\\mathrm{nm/s}$. The temporal frequency $f$ at which the feedback must respond to track the topography is given by $f=v/a$.\n$$\nf = \\frac{300\\,\\mathrm{nm/s}}{0.30\\,\\mathrm{nm}} = 1000\\,\\mathrm{s^{-1}} = 1.0\\,\\mathrm{kHz}\n$$\nThis frequency is exactly equal to the feedback loop's bandwidth, $f_b=1.0\\,\\mathrm{kHz}$.\nFor a first-order system with signal frequency $f=f_b$, the response amplitude is attenuated by a factor of $1/\\sqrt{1+(f/f_b)^2} = 1/\\sqrt{1+1^2} = 1/\\sqrt{2}$. The phase lag is $\\arctan(f/f_b) = \\arctan(1) = \\pi/4$.\nThis means that in the constant-current image, the measured amplitude of the $100\\,\\mathrm{pm}$ corrugation will be reduced to $100/\\sqrt{2} \\approx 70.7\\,\\mathrm{pm}$, a significant underestimation. The phase lag will cause features to appear shifted laterally, which constitutes a \"smearing\" or distortion of the image.\nConstant-height imaging does not rely on the feedback loop to track topography during a scan line. It is therefore not limited by the feedback bandwidth $f_b$. At this scan speed, it would provide an un-smeared current map of the surface, which represents higher fidelity or \"intrinsic lateral resolution\". The caveat that the tip must not crash is essential and correct, as constant-height mode carries a higher risk of collision on non-flat surfaces.\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\n**Option C Evaluation:**\nThis statement claims constant-current imaging *always* yields higher resolution. This is false. As demonstrated in the analysis of option B, at high scan speeds where $f \\gtrsim f_b$, the feedback response limits the resolution of constant-current imaging, and constant-height imaging can provide a higher-fidelity map.\nThe second part of the statement claims that feedback \"cancels all contributions from the local density of states (LDOS), isolating pure geometry\". This is fundamentally incorrect. The tunneling current is $I \\propto \\rho_s e^{-2\\kappa z}$. In constant-current mode, the feedback adjusts $z$ to keep $I$ constant. This implies that $\\rho_s e^{-2\\kappa z} = \\text{constant}$. Solving for the recorded height $z$ gives $z(x,y) \\propto \\frac{1}{2\\kappa}\\ln[\\rho_s(x,y)] + h(x,y)$, where $h(x,y)$ is the true geometric height. The recorded image is thus a convolution of topography and electronic structure. It does not isolate geometry.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**Option D Evaluation:**\nThis statement claims the risk of tip crash is \"negligible regardless of the chosen approach height\". This is patently false and dangerous. The risk of a crash is critically dependent on the average tip-sample distance. If the average gap is set to be comparable to or smaller than the peak height of the corrugation (here, $50\\,\\mathrm{pm}$), a crash is not only possible but certain. For example, if the average gap is set to $40\\,\\mathrm{pm}$, the tip will collide with the $50\\,\\mathrm{pm}$ peaks.\nThe reasoning provided, \"because exponential tunneling ensures that repulsive forces are never encountered\", is also incorrect. At very small separations (typically $< 0.2\\,\\mathrm{nm}$), short-range Pauli and ionic core repulsion forces dominate over the forces associated with tunneling. These strong repulsive forces are precisely what constitute a \"crash\".\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**Option E Evaluation:**\nThis statement claims that if topography is flat, \"constant-current images are immune to such [LDOS] variations\". This is the same fundamental error as in option C. If topography is flat, the constant-current condition $I=\\text{constant}$ requires $\\rho_s(x,y) e^{-2\\kappa z(x,y)} = \\text{constant}$. This leads to a recorded height signal $z(x,y) \\propto \\ln[\\rho_s(x,y)]$. Thus, variations in LDOS are directly mapped into apparent height variations in the constant-current image. Such images are not \"immune\" to LDOS; they are sensitive to it.\nThe second part, that constant-height maps will show contrast, is correct. With $z=\\text{constant}$, the current signal is $I(x,y) \\propto \\rho_s(x,y)$, directly mapping the LDOS. However, the falsity of the first claim makes the entire statement incorrect.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{AB}$$", "id": "2783070"}]}
