Interfacial free energies are defined as reversible excess Gibbs free energies per unit area.\n\nStarting from fundamental definitions and the principle of minimum Gibbs free energy at fixed $T$ and droplet volume, consider a reversible, infinitesimal advance of the three-phase contact line that converts an area $dA$ of solid–vapor into solid–liquid while changing the liquid–vapor area accordingly. Use this variational argument to obtain the mechanical equilibrium condition at the contact line. Then, using a reversible thermodynamic cycle that separates a unit area of the solid–liquid interface into solid–vapor plus liquid–vapor interfaces, express the work of adhesion in terms of interfacial free energies, and combine your results to obtain an explicit expression for the solid–liquid interfacial free energy in terms of the solid–vapor interfacial free energy, the liquid–vapor interfacial free energy, and the equilibrium contact angle.\n\nFor a particular solid–liquid–vapor system at $T=298\\ \\mathrm{K}$, independent measurements give the following values:\n- solid–vapor interfacial free energy: $\\gamma_{sv} = 0.500\\ \\mathrm{J\\,m^{-2}}$,\n- liquid–vapor interfacial free energy: $\\gamma_{lv} = 0.07280\\ \\mathrm{J\\,m^{-2}}$,\n- equilibrium contact angle of the sessile droplet: $\\theta = 60.00^{\\circ}$ (angle in degrees).\n\nUsing your derived expression, compute the solid–liquid interfacial free energy $\\gamma_{sl}$ for this system.

It is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and contains all necessary information for a complete solution. We shall proceed with the derivation and calculation as requested.\n\nThe fundamental principle governing the equilibrium state of the system at constant temperature $T$, pressure $P$, and fixed droplet volume $V$ is the minimization of the total Gibbs free energy, $G$. For this three-phase system, the total Gibbs free energy includes contributions from the bulk phases and the interfaces. As the bulk properties are fixed, the equilibrium shape of the droplet is determined by the minimization of the total interfacial free energy, which is the sum of the free energies of the three interfaces: solid–liquid (sl), solid–vapor (sv), and liquid–vapor (lv).\n\nLet $A_{sl}$, $A_{sv}$, and $A_{lv}$ be the areas of the solid–liquid, solid–vapor, and liquid–vapor interfaces, respectively. Let $\\gamma_{sl}$, $\\gamma_{sv}$, and $\\gamma_{lv}$ be the corresponding interfacial free energies per unit area. The total interfacial Gibbs free energy is:\n$$G_{interface} = \\gamma_{sl} A_{sl} + \\gamma_{sv} A_{sv} + \\gamma_{lv} A_{lv}$$\nWe consider a reversible, infinitesimal advance of the three-phase contact line along the rigid solid substrate. Let this displacement be parameterized by a distance $d\\xi$. Let the total length of the contact line be $L$. This displacement converts an area $dA = Ld\\xi$ of the solid–vapor interface into a solid–liquid interface.\nThe change in the solid–liquid interface area is $dA_{sl} = Ld\\xi$.\nThe change in the solid–vapor interface area is $dA_{sv} = -Ld\\xi$.\nThe liquid is in contact with the solid at an angle $\\theta$, the equilibrium contact angle. The displacement of the contact line by $d\\xi$ results in a change in the liquid–vapor interface area. From the geometry of the contact line, this change is $dA_{lv} = (L \\cos\\theta) d\\xi$.\n\nThe differential change in the total interfacial Gibbs free energy, $dG_{interface}$, for this virtual displacement is:\n$$dG_{interface} = \\gamma_{sl} dA_{sl} + \\gamma_{sv} dA_{sv} + \\gamma_{lv} dA_{lv}$$\nSubstituting the expressions for the differential areas, we obtain:\n$$dG_{interface} = \\gamma_{sl} (Ld\\xi) + \\gamma_{sv} (-Ld\\xi) + \\gamma_{lv} (L d\\xi \\cos\\theta)$$\n$$dG_{interface} = (\\gamma_{sl} - \\gamma_{sv} + \\gamma_{lv} \\cos\\theta) Ld\\xi$$\nAt equilibrium, the total interfacial free energy must be at a minimum with respect to such variations. Therefore, $dG_{interface} = 0$ for any arbitrary non-zero displacement $d\\xi$. This requires the term in the parenthesis to be zero:\n$$\\gamma_{sl} - \\gamma_{sv} + \\gamma_{lv} \\cos\\theta = 0$$\nThis can be rearranged to give the mechanical equilibrium condition at the contact line, known as Young's equation:\n$$\\gamma_{sv} = \\gamma_{sl} + \\gamma_{lv} \\cos\\theta$$\nThis equation represents the balance of interfacial tensions projected onto the solid surface.\n\nNext, we define the work of adhesion, $W_{ad}$, which is the reversible work required per unit area to separate a solid–liquid interface, creating a solid–vapor and a liquid–vapor interface in its place. Consider a thermodynamic cycle for a unit area of interface.\nThe initial state is a solid–liquid interface of unit area. Its contribution to the Gibbs free energy is $G_{initial} = \\gamma_{sl} \\times 1$.\nThe final state consists of a solid–vapor interface of unit area and a liquid–vapor interface of unit area. The Gibbs free energy is $G_{final} = (\\gamma_{sv} \\times 1) + (\\gamma_{lv} \\times 1)$.\nThe work done on the system, which is the work of adhesion, is equal to the change in Gibbs free energy, $W_{ad} = \\Delta G = G_{final} - G_{initial}$.\nTherefore, the work of adhesion is given by the Dupré equation:\n$$W_{ad} = \\gamma_{sv} + \\gamma_{lv} - \\gamma_{sl}$$\nThe problem requires an explicit expression for the solid–liquid interfacial free energy, $\\gamma_{sl}$, in terms of $\\gamma_{sv}$, $\\gamma_{lv}$, and $\\theta$. Young's equation, which we derived as the first result, already provides this relationship directly upon rearrangement. The instruction to \"combine your results\" is somewhat superfluous, as Young's equation is the direct consequence of the variational argument and contains all the necessary terms. Simple algebraic manipulation of Young's equation yields the required expression:\n$$\\gamma_{sl} = \\gamma_{sv} - \\gamma_{lv} \\cos\\theta$$\nFor completeness, combining this with the Dupré equation yields the Young-Dupré equation for the work of adhesion: $W_{ad} = (\\gamma_{sl} + \\gamma_{lv} \\cos\\theta) + \\gamma_{lv} - \\gamma_{sl} = \\gamma_{lv}(1 + \\cos\\theta)$. This is a useful relation, but the expression for $\\gamma_{sl}$ itself is derived solely from Young's equation.\n\nFinally, we compute the numerical value for $\\gamma_{sl}$ using the provided data:\n- Solid–vapor interfacial free energy: $\\gamma_{sv} = 0.500\\ \\mathrm{J\\,m^{-2}}$\n- Liquid–vapor interfacial free energy: $\\gamma_{lv} = 0.07280\\ \\mathrm{J\\,m^{-2}}$\n- Equilibrium contact angle: $\\theta = 60.00^{\\circ}$\n\nFirst, we calculate the cosine of the angle. For $\\theta = 60.00^{\\circ}$, the cosine is $\\cos(60.00^{\\circ})$. The angle $60^{\\circ}$ is a fundamental angle whose cosine is exactly $0.5$. Given the precision, we will take $\\cos(60.00^{\\circ})$ as $0.5$ for the primary calculation.\n$$\\cos(60.00^{\\circ}) = 0.5$$\nNow, substitute the values into the derived expression for $\\gamma_{sl}$:\n$$\\gamma_{sl} = 0.500\\ \\mathrm{J\\,m^{-2}} - (0.07280\\ \\mathrm{J\\,m^{-2}}) \\times 0.5$$\n$$\\gamma_{sl} = 0.500\\ \\mathrm{J\\,m^{-2}} - 0.03640\\ \\mathrm{J\\,m^{-2}}$$\n$$\\gamma_{sl} = 0.4636\\ \\mathrm{J\\,m^{-2}}$$\nThe problem requires the final answer to be expressed in units of $\\mathrm{mJ\\,m^{-2}}$. The conversion is $1\\ \\mathrm{J} = 1000\\ \\mathrm{mJ}$.\n$$\\gamma_{sl} = 0.4636 \\times 1000\\ \\mathrm{mJ\\,m^{-2}} = 463.6\\ \\mathrm{mJ\\,m^{-2}}$$\nThe problem also mandates that the answer be rounded to four significant figures.

It is a well-posed problem in the thermodynamics of curved interfaces, resting on established principles of statistical mechanics and surface science. It is free of contradiction, ambiguity, and scientific unsoundness. We shall proceed with its solution.\n\nThe system is a spherical liquid droplet of radius $R$ in equilibrium with its vapor. The system is held at constant temperature $T$ and chemical potential $\\mu$. For an open system at constant $T$ and $\\mu$, the state of thermodynamic equilibrium corresponds to a minimum of the grand potential, $\\Omega$. The total grand potential of the system, $\\Omega_{\\text{total}}$, is the sum of contributions from the interior liquid phase (in), the exterior vapor phase (out), and the spherical interface (s) separating them:\n$$\n\\Omega_{\\text{total}} = \\Omega_{\\text{in}} + \\Omega_{\\text{out}} + \\Omega_{\\text{s}}\n$$\nFor a homogeneous bulk phase, the grand potential is given by $\\Omega = -pV$, where $p$ is the pressure and $V$ is the volume.
