It is a standard problem in surface crystallography. I will proceed with a rigorous derivation.\n\nThe problem requires the derivation of two quantities for a $(\\sqrt{3}\\times\\sqrt{3})R30^{\\circ}$ reconstruction on an fcc$(111)$ surface: the ratio of primitive-cell areas, $A_{\\mathrm{recon}}/A_{1\\times 1}$, and the number of substrate atoms in the reconstructed primitive cell, $N_{\\mathrm{recon}}$.\n\nFirst, we establish the properties of the unreconstructed, or $(1\\times 1)$, surface. The problem states that the fcc$(111)$ surface forms a two-dimensional hexagonal Bravais lattice. Let the primitive vectors of this lattice be $\\mathbf{a}_{1}$ and $\\mathbf{a}_{2}$. We are given that they have equal length, which we denote as $s = |\\mathbf{a}_{1}| = |\\mathbf{a}_{2}|$, and the angle between them is $\\theta = 60^{\\circ}$. The area of the primitive cell of this $(1\\times 1)$ surface, $A_{1\\times 1}$, is given by the magnitude of the cross product of its primitive vectors:\n$$A_{1\\times 1} = |\\mathbf{a}_{1} \\times \\mathbf{a}_{2}| = |\\mathbf{a}_{1}| |\\mathbf{a}_{2}| \\sin(\\theta) = s^2 \\sin(60^{\\circ}) = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}s^2$$\n\nNext, we analyze the reconstructed surface. The notation $(\\sqrt{3}\\times\\sqrt{3})R30^{\\circ}$ specifies the relationship between the primitive vectors of the reconstructed lattice, $\\mathbf{b}_{1}$ and $\\mathbf{b}_{2}$, and the substrate lattice vectors, $\\mathbf{a}_{1}$ and $\\mathbf{a}_{2}$. The relationship is a linear transformation, which can be expressed in matrix form:\n$$\n\\begin{pmatrix} \\mathbf{b}_{1} \\\\ \\mathbf{b}_{2} \\end{pmatrix} = M \\begin{pmatrix} \\mathbf{a}_{1} \\\\ \\mathbf{a}_{2} \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} M_{11}  M_{12} \\\\ M_{21}  M_{22} \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} \\mathbf{a}_{1} \\\\ \\mathbf{a}_{2} \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nwhere $M_{ij}$ are integers.

Let us find a vector in the new lattice by applying the scaling and rotation to one of the substrate vectors, for instance $\\mathbf{a}_{1}$.

The problem specifies the condition of atom conservation in the surface layer (no adatoms, vacancies, or intermixing). This means the number density of atoms, $\\sigma$, is constant across the surface.\nThe $(1\\times 1)$ unit cell is primitive by definition, and its corresponding lattice is a Bravais lattice of substrate atoms. Therefore, the $(1\\times 1)$ primitive cell contains exactly one atom, $N_{1\\times 1} = 1$.\nThe atom number density is $\\sigma = \\frac{N_{1\\times 1}}{A_{1\\times 1}} = \\frac{1}{A_{1\\times 1}}$.\nThe number of atoms in the reconstructed cell is its area multiplied by this density:\n$$ N_{\\mathrm{recon}} = \\sigma \\times A_{\\mathrm{recon}} = \\left(\\frac{1}{A_{1\\times 1}}\\right) A_{\\mathrm{recon}} = \\frac{A_{\\mathrm{recon}}}{A_{1\\times 1}} $$\nFrom our previous result, this ratio is $3$.\n$$ N_{\\mathrm{recon}} = 3 $$\nTherefore, the reconstructed primitive cell contains $3$ substrate atoms.\n\nThe final answer is a two-component row vector comprising the area ratio and the number of atoms.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n3  3\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "2792154"}, {"introduction": "Once a real-space model of a reconstructed surface is proposed, it must be validated against experimental observation.

The intensity of a diffracted beam corresponding to the reciprocal lattice vector $\\mathbf{G}=H\\,\\mathbf{b}_1'+K\\,\\mathbf{b}_2'$ is proportional to $|F(H,K)|^2$.\n\nThe structure factor is given by the sum over the atoms in the unit cell basis:\n$$\nF(H,K)=\\sum_{j} f_j\\,\\exp\\!\\big(i\\,\\mathbf{G}\\cdot\\mathbf{r}_j\\big)\n$$\nThe basis consists of two atoms:\n1.  Atom 1 at $\\mathbf{r}_1 = (0,0)$ with scattering amplitude $f_1=f$.\n2.  Atom 2 at $\\mathbf{r}_2 = (a_x/2, a_y)$ with scattering amplitude $f_2=\\alpha f e^{i\\phi}$.\n\nThe problem states to use the approximations $\\alpha\\simeq 1$ and $\\phi\\simeq 0$, so $f_2 \\simeq f$. The structure factor becomes:\n$$\nF(H,K) \\simeq f\\exp(i\\,\\mathbf{G}\\cdot\\mathbf{r}_1) + f\\exp(i\\,\\mathbf{G}\\cdot\\mathbf{r}_2)\n$$\nLet us compute the dot products $\\mathbf{G}\\cdot\\mathbf{r}_j$.\nThe reciprocal lattice vector is $\\mathbf{G} = H(2\\pi/a_x)\\hat{\\mathbf{x}} + K(\\pi/a_y)\\hat{\\mathbf{y}}$.\n\nFor atom 1, at $\\mathbf{r}_1=(0,0)$:\n$$\n\\mathbf{G}\\cdot\\mathbf{r}_1 = \\left( H\\frac{2\\pi}{a_x}\\hat{\\mathbf{x}} + K\\frac{\\pi}{a_y}\\hat{\\mathbf{y}} \\right) \\cdot (0\\hat{\\mathbf{x}}+0\\hat{\\mathbf{y}}) = 0\n$$\n\nFor atom 2, at $\\mathbf{r}_2=(a_x/2, a_y)$:\n$$\n\\mathbf{G}\\cdot\\mathbf{r}_2 = \\left( H\\frac{2\\pi}{a_x}\\hat{\\mathbf{x}} + K\\frac{\\pi}{a_y}\\hat{\\mathbf{y}} \\right) \\cdot \\left( \\frac{a_x}{2}\\hat{\\mathbf{x}} + a_y\\hat{\\mathbf{y}} \\right) = \\left(H\\frac{2\\pi}{a_x}\\right)\\left(\\frac{a_x}{2}\\right) + \\left(K\\frac{\\pi}{a_y}\\right)(a_y) = H\\pi + K\\pi = \\pi(H+K)\n$$\n\nSubstituting these into the structure factor expression:\n$$\nF(H,K) \\simeq f\\exp(i \\cdot 0) + f\\exp(i\\pi(H+K)) = f(1 + e^{i\\pi(H+K)})\n$$\nSince $H$ and $K$ are integers, the sum $H+K$ is also an integer. We analyze the value of $e^{i\\pi(H+K)}$:\n- If $H+K$ is an even integer, $H+K=2n$, then $e^{i\\pi(2n)} = \\cos(2n\\pi) + i\\sin(2n\\pi) = 1$.\n- If $H+K$ is an odd integer, $H+K=2n+1$, then $e^{i\\pi(2n+1)} = \\cos((2n+1)\\pi) + i\\sin((2n+1)\\pi) = -1$.\n\nThis leads to two cases for the structure factor and the corresponding intensity $I(H,K) \\propto |F(H,K)|^2$:\n\n1.  **$H+K$ is even**:\n    $F(H,K) \\simeq f(1+1) = 2f$.\n    $I(H,K) \\propto |2f|^2 = 4|f|^2$. These spots are **strong**. This occurs when $H$ and $K$ are both even, or when $H$ and $K$ are both odd.\n\n2.  **$H+K$ is odd**:\n    $F(H,K) \\simeq f(1-1) = 0$.\n    $I(H,K) \\propto 0$. These spots are systematically absent, or **weak**. This occurs when one of $H, K$ is even and the other is odd.\n\nThe question specifically asks about the \"half-order spots\". The reconstruction from a $(1\\times 1)$ to a $(1\\times 2)$ surface doubles the periodicity along the $\\mathbf{a}_2$ direction. In reciprocal space, this creates new diffraction spots located halfway between the original spots along the corresponding reciprocal direction. The original spots correspond to integer indices in the unreconstructed reciprocal lattice, which means they correspond to even integer values of $K$ in the reconstructed indexing scheme (since $\\mathbf{b}_2=2\\mathbf{b}_2'$). The new \"half-order\" spots are therefore those with an odd integer value for $K$.\n\nWe must analyze the intensity of spots for $K$ odd:\n- If $H$ is **odd**, then $H+K$ is (odd + odd) = even. In this case, $I(H,K)$ is **strong**.\n- If $H$ is **even**, then $H+K$ is (even + odd) = odd. In this case, $I(H,K)$ is **weak** (zero in this model).\n\nTherefore, for the half-order spots ($K$ is odd), those with an odd index $H$ are strong, while those with an even index $H$ are weak.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. New half-order spots appear along the doubling direction; among these, spots with $K$ odd and $H$ even are strong, while those with $K$ odd and $H$ odd are weak.**\nThis statement is incorrect. Our derivation shows the opposite: for $K$ odd, spots with $H$ odd are strong and spots with $H$ even are weak.\n\n**B. New half-order spots appear along the doubling direction; among these, spots with $K$ odd and $H$ odd are strong, while those with $K$ odd and $H$ even are weak.**\nThis statement is correct. The $(1\\times 2)$ reconstruction introduces new half-order spots. Our analysis of the structure factor confirms that for $K$ odd, the spots with $H$ odd are strong, and those with $H$ even are weak due to destructive interference.\n\n**C. No half-order spots appear; only the intensities of integer-order spots change due to surface relaxation.**\nThis statement is incorrect. Any reconstruction that increases the size of the real-space unit cell must, by the principles of Fourier analysis, introduce new, more closely spaced spots in the diffraction pattern (reciprocal space). A $(1\\times 2)$ reconstruction necessarily creates half-order spots.\n\n**D. Half-order spots appear along the doubling direction and have comparable intensities irrespective of $H$ parity when $K$ is odd.**\nThis statement is incorrect. The presence of a basis of more than one atom within the unit cell introduces a structure factor that modulates the intensities of the diffraction spots. Our calculation shows a systematic dependence on the parity of $H$ (for odd $K$), leading to a clear \"strong vs. weak\" pattern, not comparable intensities.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2864379"}, {"introduction": "First-principles calculations, particularly Density Functional Theory (DFT), are indispensable tools for determining the stability and electronic properties of reconstructed surfaces.
