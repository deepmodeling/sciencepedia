It is scientifically grounded in the principles of colloid and interface science, specifically the Derjaguin-Landau-Verwey-Overbeek (DLVO) theory. The problem is well-posed, providing all necessary parameters and constants ($A_{132}$, $R$, $h$, $T$, $k_B$) for a unique solution. The language is objective and precise. The condition for the Derjaguin approximation, $h \\ll R$, is explicitly stated and is satisfied by the given numerical values ($2\\ \\mathrm{nm} \\ll 500\\ \\mathrm{nm}$), ensuring the problem is self-consistent. Therefore, I will proceed with the derivation and calculation.\n\nThe task is to derive the non-retarded van der Waals (vdW) interaction energy, $U_{\\text{vdW}}(h)$, between a sphere of radius $R$ and a planar semi-infinite half-space, separated by a distance $h$. We begin, as instructed, from the interaction between two planar half-spaces.\n\nThe interaction free energy per unit area, $W(h)$, between two semi-infinite parallel flat plates separated by a distance $h$ in a medium is given by the Lifshitz theory. In the non-retarded limit, this can be expressed using the Hamaker constant. For a system composed of material $1$ (sphere), material $2$ (plane), and an intervening medium $3$, the effective Hamaker constant is $A_{132}$. The interaction energy per unit area between two flat plates of materials $1$ and $2$ across medium $3$ is:\n$$\nW_{132}(h) = -\\frac{A_{132}}{12\\pi h^{2}}\n$$\nThis expression arises from summing the pairwise London dispersion potentials ($w(r) = -C/r^{6}$) over all atom pairs in the two interacting bodies.\n\nTo find the interaction between a curved surface (the sphere) and a flat surface (the plane), we employ the Derjaguin approximation. This geometric approximation is valid when the radius of curvature of the surfaces is much larger than the separation distance, i.e., $R \\gg h$. In our case, $R = 500\\ \\mathrm{nm}$ and $h = 2\\ \\mathrm{nm}$, so the condition $h/R = 2/500 = 0.004 \\ll 1$ is satisfied. The approximation relates the force, $F(h)$, between the curved bodies to the interaction energy per unit area, $W(h)$, between two infinite parallel plates at the same separation $h$. The sphere-plane geometry can be treated as a stack of infinitesimal annular rings of the sphere's surface interacting with the plane. The force is given by:\n$$\nF(h) = 2\\pi R W_{132}(h)\n$$\nSubstituting the expression for $W_{132}(h)$, we obtain the force as a function of separation:\n$$\nF(h) = 2\\pi R \\left( -\\frac{A_{132}}{12\\pi h^{2}} \\right) = -\\frac{A_{132} R}{6 h^{2}}\n$$\nThe interaction potential energy, $U_{\\text{vdW}}(h)$, is defined as the work done in bringing the sphere from an infinite separation to a separation $h$. It is calculated by integrating the force from $\\infty$ to $h$. Let us be precise about the sign. The force is $F(h) = -dU/dh$. The force we calculated, $F(h) = -A_{132}R/(6h^2)$, is attractive (negative sign). The potential energy should thus decrease as the bodies approach.\n$U(h) - U(\\infty) = -\\int_{\\infty}^h F(D) dD$.

The electrostatic component, $V_{EDL}$, arises from the overlap of the electrical double layers (EDLs) that form at the charged surface-electrolyte interface. The structure of the EDL and the resulting interaction are governed by the Poisson-Boltzmann equation. The surface charge density $\\sigma$ serves as a boundary condition for this equation, determining the surface electrical potential $\\psi_0$. For a given electrolyte composition (i.e., fixed ionic strength and thus a fixed Debye length, $\\kappa^{-1}$), the magnitude and range of the repulsive potential energy, $V_{EDL}$, are monotonically increasing functions of the magnitude of the surface potential, $|\\psi_0|$. The Grahame equation relates $\\sigma$ and $\\psi_0$, showing that $|\\psi_0|$ is a monotonically increasing function of $|\\sigma|$. Therefore, a larger magnitude of surface charge density leads to a stronger electrostatic repulsion between two identical surfaces at any given separation.\nIn this case, $|\\sigma(\\mathrm{pH}=8)| \\approx 0.1586\\ \\mathrm{C\\,m^{-2}}$ is substantially larger than $|\\sigma(\\mathrm{pH}=5)| \\approx 0.01457\\ \\mathrm{C\\,m^{-2}}$. Consequently, increasing the $\\mathrm{pH}$ from $5$ to $8$ significantly enhances the electrostatic repulsion between the surfaces.\n\nFinally, we compute the dimensionless ratio $R$:\n$$ R = \\frac{|\\sigma(\\mathrm{pH}=8)|}{|\\sigma(\\mathrm{pH}=5)|} $$\nSubstituting the expression $\\sigma = -e\\,\\Gamma\\,\\alpha$, the constants $e$ and $\\Gamma$ cancel out:\n$$ R = \\frac{|-e\\,\\Gamma\\,\\alpha(\\mathrm{pH}=8)|}{|-e\\,\\Gamma\\,\\alpha(\\mathrm{pH}=5)|} = \\frac{\\alpha(\\mathrm{pH}=8)}{\\alpha(\\mathrm{pH}=5)} $$\nUsing the exact fractional forms for $\\alpha$ derived earlier:\n$$ R = \\frac{\\frac{100}{101}}{\\frac{1}{11}} = \\frac{100}{101} \\times 11 = \\frac{1100}{101} $$\nCalculating the numerical value:\n$$ R \\approx 10.891089... $$\nRounding to four significant figures, we obtain the final answer.\n$$ R = 10.89 $$", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{10.89}\n$$", "id": "2768566"}]}
