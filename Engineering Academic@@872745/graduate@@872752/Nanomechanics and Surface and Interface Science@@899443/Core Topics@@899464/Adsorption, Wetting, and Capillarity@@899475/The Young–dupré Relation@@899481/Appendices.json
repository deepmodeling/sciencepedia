It determines whether a liquid will spread over a solid surface ($S \\ge 0$) or form a droplet with a finite contact angle ($S  0$).\n\nThe equilibrium contact angle, $\\theta_Y$, is related to the work of adhesion and the liquid-vapor surface tension through the Young-Dupré equation:\n$$W_{\\mathrm{ad}} = \\gamma_{LV}(1 + \\cos\\theta_Y)$$\n\nUsing the provided thermodynamic definitions and the Young-Dupré equation, derive an expression for the spreading coefficient, $S$, that is a function of only the liquid-vapor surface tension, $\\gamma_{LV}$, and the equilibrium contact angle, $\\theta_Y$.", "solution": "1.

The calculation shows that $W_{\\mathrm{ad}}^{\\mathrm{hydrox}} > W_{\\mathrm{ad}}^{\\mathrm{pristine}}$, meaning adhesion between water and alumina is significantly stronger after hydroxylation. This can be explained by the change in intermolecular forces at the interface.\n\nA dehydroxylated alumina surface, terminated by $\\mathrm{Al-O-Al}$ bridges, interacts with water primarily through van der Waals forces and some Lewis acid-base interactions. These interactions are weaker and less specific than hydrogen bonds.\n\nWhen the surface is hydroxylated, it becomes covered with terminal hydroxyl groups ($\\mathrm{Al-OH}$). These surface groups can now act as both donors and acceptors of hydrogen bonds, allowing them to integrate directly into the extensive hydrogen-bond network of liquid water. This creates a dense network of strong, directional hydrogen bonds at the solid-liquid interface. Since hydrogen bonds are significantly stronger than the other non-covalent interactions, their formation greatly increases the total adhesive energy between the solid and the liquid. The large calculated increase in the work of adhesion ($\\approx 43.7\\ \\mathrm{mJ}\\ \\mathrm{m}^{-2}$) is the macroscopic manifestation of the collective energy of these newly formed interfacial hydrogen bonds. Stronger adhesion promotes wetting, which is observed as a sharp decrease in the contact angle from $75.0^\\circ$ to $30.0^\\circ$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n90.60  134.3\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "2945751"}, {"introduction": "Interfacial properties are not static but are functions of the system's thermodynamic state, critically depending on variables like temperature.
