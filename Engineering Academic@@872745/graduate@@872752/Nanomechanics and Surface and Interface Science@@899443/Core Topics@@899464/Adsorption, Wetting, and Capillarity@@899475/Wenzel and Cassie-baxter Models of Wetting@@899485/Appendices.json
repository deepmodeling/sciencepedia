We shall proceed by applying the principle of virtual work, which states that for a system in equilibrium, the change in its total free energy for any infinitesimal virtual displacement is zero.\n\nThe total Gibbs free energy, $G$, of the three-phase system (solid, liquid, vapor) is the sum of the energies of the interfaces:\n$$\nG = A_{SL}\\gamma_{SL} + A_{SV}\\gamma_{SV} + A_{LV}\\gamma_{LV}\n$$\nwhere $A_{SL}$, $A_{SV}$, and $A_{LV}$ are the areas of the solid-liquid, solid-vapor, and liquid-vapor interfaces, respectively, and $\\gamma_{SL}$, $\\gamma_{SV}$, and $\\gamma_{LV}$ are their corresponding interfacial tensions (free energies per unit area).\n\nWe consider a virtual displacement of the three-phase contact line that results in an infinitesimal increase, $\\mathrm{d}A$, in the projected area of the wetted solid surface.

It is a standard problem in the physics of wetting on textured surfaces. All supplied data are physically reasonable.

The system is a sessile droplet on a composite surface in mechanical equilibrium. The equilibrium state corresponds to a minimum in the total free energy of the system for a fixed liquid volume. Following the problem's directive, we consider an infinitesimal outward virtual displacement of the macroscopic three-phase contact line. Let this displacement cause an increase in the projected wetted area by an amount $dA$. The total free energy of the system, $E$, is the sum of the energies of all interfaces:\n$$E = A_{LV} \\gamma_{LV} + A_{SL} \\gamma_{SL} + A_{SV} \\gamma_{SV}$$\nwhere $A_{LV}$, $A_{SL}$, and $A_{SV}$ are the total areas of the liquid-vapor, solid-liquid, and solid-vapor interfaces, and $\\gamma_{LV}$, $\\gamma_{SL}$, and $\\gamma_{SV}$ are the corresponding interfacial tensions.\n\nAt equilibrium, the change in total free energy $dE$ for such a virtual displacement at constant volume must be zero.\n$$dE = \\gamma_{LV} dA_{LV} + \\gamma_{SL} dA_{SL} + \\gamma_{SV} dA_{SV} = 0$$\n\nWe must evaluate the change in each interfacial area, $dA_{ij}$, resulting from the increase in projected contact area, $dA$.\n$1$. The solid-liquid interface area, $A_{SL}$, increases as the droplet contact area expands over the solid portions of the texture. By definition of the solid fraction $\\phi_{s}$, this change is $dA_{SL} = \\phi_{s} \\, dA$.\n$2$. The solid-vapor interface area, $A_{SV}$, decreases by the same amount, as the wetted solid regions are no longer in contact with vapor. Thus, $dA_{SV} = -\\phi_{s} \\, dA$.\n$3$. The total liquid-vapor area, $A_{LV}$, is composed of two parts: the area of the spherical cap of the droplet, $A_{cap}$, and the area of the liquid-vapor interface trapped over the air pockets within the contact area, $A_{trapped}$. The change $dA_{LV}$ is thus $dA_{LV} = dA_{cap} + dA_{trapped}$.\nFor a spherical cap of constant volume, a change in base area $dA$ is related to a change in surface area $dA_{cap}$ by the macroscopic contact angle $\\theta^{*}$. This well-known result from the calculus of variations gives $dA_{cap} = (\\cos\\theta^{*}) \\, dA$.\nThe area of the trapped liquid-vapor interface increases as the contact area expands over the air/vapor regions of the texture. By definition, this change is $dA_{trapped} = (1 - \\phi_{s}) \\, dA$.\nCombining these, the total change in liquid-vapor area is $dA_{LV} = (\\cos\\theta^{*}) \\, dA + (1 - \\phi_{s}) \\, dA$.\n\nSubstituting these differential area changes back into the equilibrium condition $dE = 0$:\n$$\\gamma_{LV} \\left( (\\cos\\theta^{*}) \\, dA + (1 - \\phi_{s}) \\, dA \\right) + \\gamma_{SL} (\\phi_{s} \\, dA) + \\gamma_{SV} (-\\phi_{s} \\, dA) = 0$$\nSince $dA$ is a non-zero differential area, we can divide the entire equation by $dA$:\n$$\\gamma_{LV} (\\cos\\theta^{*} + 1 - \\phi_{s}) + \\phi_{s} (\\gamma_{SL} - \\gamma_{SV}) = 0$$\nRearranging to solve for $\\gamma_{LV} \\cos\\theta^{*}$:\n$$\\gamma_{LV} \\cos\\theta^{*} = - \\gamma_{LV} (1 - \\phi_{s}) - \\phi_{s} (\\gamma_{SL} - \\gamma_{SV})$$\n$$\\gamma_{LV} \\cos\\theta^{*} = \\phi_{s} (\\gamma_{SV} - \\gamma_{SL}) - \\gamma_{LV} (1 - \\phi_{s})$$\nWe are given Young's law for the chemically identical smooth solid: $\\gamma_{SV} - \\gamma_{SL} = \\gamma_{LV} \\cos \\theta_{Y}$.

A value of $\\phi_{s} \\approx 0.092$ signifies that only approximately $9.2\\%$ of the projected area beneath the droplet is in contact with the solid, while the remaining $90.8\\%$ is suspended over air pockets. This is a characteristic feature of superhydrophobic surfaces. To evaluate its feasibility, we consider a simple, idealized microtexture geometry: a square array of cylindrical micropillars.

The solid fraction $\\phi_{s}$ for such a geometry is the ratio of the pillar top area to the unit cell area:\n$$\\phi_{s} = \\frac{\\pi R^{2}}{L^{2}}$$\nUsing our calculated value for $\\phi_{s}$:\n$$0.09166 = \\pi \\left(\\frac{R}{L}\\right)^{2}$$\nSolving for the aspect ratio $R/L$:\n$$\\frac{R}{L} = \\sqrt{\\frac{0.09166}{\\pi}} \\approx \\sqrt{0.02917} \\approx 0.1708$$\nThis implies a pitch-to-radius ratio of $L/R \\approx 5.85$, or a pitch-to-diameter ratio of $L/(2R) \\approx 2.93$. This means the center-to-center distance between pillars is roughly three times the pillar diameter. Such geometric parameters are not only plausible but are typical for microfabricated surfaces engineered for superhydrophobicity using techniques like photolithography and etching.

The energy change is $\\gamma_{LV}(1-\\phi_{s})\\,\\mathrm{d}A_{\\mathrm{proj}}$.\n\nThe total change in substrate energy for the Cassie-Baxter model is the sum of these two contributions:\n$$ \\mathrm{d}G_{\\mathrm{sub,CB}} = [\\phi_{s}(\\gamma_{SL} - \\gamma_{SV}) + \\gamma_{LV}(1-\\phi_{s})] \\mathrm{d}A_{\\mathrm{proj}} $$\nThe total free energy change, $\\mathrm{d}G_{\\mathrm{CB}}$, is:\n$$ \\mathrm{d}G_{\\mathrm{CB}} = \\mathrm{d}G_{\\mathrm{sub,CB}} + \\mathrm{d}G_{\\mathrm{cap}} = [\\phi_{s}(\\gamma_{SL} - \\gamma_{SV}) + \\gamma_{LV}(1-\\phi_{s}) + \\gamma_{LV} \\cos\\theta^{*}_{\\mathrm{CB}}] \\mathrm{d}A_{\\mathrm{proj}} $$\nAt equilibrium, $\\mathrm{d}G_{\\mathrm{CB}} = 0$.\n$$ \\phi_{s}(\\gamma_{SL} - \\gamma_{SV}) + \\gamma_{LV}(1-\\phi_{s}) + \\gamma_{LV} \\cos\\theta^{*}_{\\mathrm{CB}} = 0 $$\n$$ \\gamma_{LV} \\cos\\theta^{*}_{\\mathrm{CB}} = -\\phi_{s}(\\gamma_{SL} - \\gamma_{SV}) - \\gamma_{LV}(1-\\phi_{s}) = \\phi_{s}(\\gamma_{SV} - \\gamma_{SL}) - \\gamma_{LV}(1-\\phi_{s}) $$\nSubstituting Young's relation:\n$$ \\gamma_{LV} \\cos\\theta^{*}_{\\mathrm{CB}} = \\phi_{s}(\\gamma_{LV} \\cos\\theta_{Y}) - \\gamma_{LV}(1-\\phi_{s}) $$\nThis yields the Cassie-Baxter equation:\n$$ \\cos\\theta^{*}_{\\mathrm{CB}} = \\phi_{s} \\cos\\theta_{Y} - (1-\\phi_{s}) = \\phi_{s} \\cos\\theta_{Y} + \\phi_{s} - 1 $$\n\nNumerical Computation:\nGiven parameters are $\\theta_{Y}=120^{\\circ}$, $r=1.3$, and $\\phi_{s}=0.08$.\nFirst, $\\cos\\theta_{Y} = \\cos(120^{\\circ}) = -0.5$.\nFor the Wenzel state:\n$$ \\cos\\theta^{*}_{\\mathrm{W}} = r \\cos\\theta_{Y} = 1.3 \\times (-0.5) = -0.65 $$\nFor the Cassie-Baxter state:\n$$ \\cos\\theta^{*}_{\\mathrm{CB}} = \\phi_{s} \\cos\\theta_{Y} + \\phi_{s} - 1 = 0.08 \\times (-0.5) + 0.08 - 1 = -0.04 + 0.08 - 1 = 0.04 - 1 = -0.96 $$\nRounded to four significant figures, we have $\\cos\\theta^{*}_{\\mathrm{W}} = -0.6500$ and $\\cos\\theta^{*}_{\\mathrm{CB}} = -0.9600$.\n\nComparison of Interfacial Free Energy:\nWe must compare the change in interfacial free energy per unit projected area for the textured region when it goes from a dry (solid-vapor) state to a wet state (Wenzel or Cassie-Baxter).\nThe initial energy per unit projected area, $E_{\\mathrm{dry}}$, for a dry surface with roughness $r$ is $E_{\\mathrm{dry}} = r \\gamma_{SV}$.\n\nFor the Wenzel state, the entire rough surface is wetted. The final energy per unit projected area is $E_{\\mathrm{W}} = r \\gamma_{SL}$.\nThe change in energy per unit projected area is:\n$$ \\Delta E_{\\mathrm{W}} = E_{\\mathrm{W}} - E_{\\mathrm{dry}} = r \\gamma_{SL} - r \\gamma_{SV} = r(\\gamma_{SL} - \\gamma_{SV}) = -r \\gamma_{LV} \\cos\\theta_{Y} $$\n\nFor the Cassie-Baxter state, the final interface is a composite. The final energy per unit projected area is the sum of energies of the solid-liquid tops, the remaining solid-vapor grooves, and the new liquid-vapor interface spanning the grooves.\nActual area of solid-liquid interface = $\\phi_{s} \\times (\\text{projected area})$.\nActual area of trapped liquid-vapor interface = $(1-\\phi_{s}) \\times (\\text{projected area})$.\nActual area of solid-vapor interface in grooves = $(r - \\phi_{s}) \\times (\\text{projected area})$.\nThe final energy per unit projected area is $E_{\\mathrm{CB}} = \\phi_{s}\\gamma_{SL} + (r-\\phi_{s})\\gamma_{SV} + (1-\\phi_{s})\\gamma_{LV}$.\nThe change in energy per unit projected area is:\n$$ \\Delta E_{\\mathrm{CB}} = E_{\\mathrm{CB}} - E_{\\mathrm{dry}} = [\\phi_{s}\\gamma_{SL} + (r-\\phi_{s})\\gamma_{SV} + (1-\\phi_{s})\\gamma_{LV}] - r\\gamma_{SV} $$\n$$ \\Delta E_{\\mathrm{CB}} = \\phi_{s}\\gamma_{SL} - \\phi_{s}\\gamma_{SV} + (1-\\phi_{s})\\gamma_{LV} = \\phi_{s}(\\gamma_{SL} - \\gamma_{SV}) + (1-\\phi_{s})\\gamma_{LV} $$\n$$ \\Delta E_{\\mathrm{CB}} = -\\phi_{s} \\gamma_{LV} \\cos\\theta_{Y} + (1-\\phi_{s}) \\gamma_{LV} = \\gamma_{LV}(1 - \\phi_{s} - \\phi_{s}\\cos\\theta_{Y}) $$\n\nNow we compare $\\Delta E_{\\mathrm{W}}$ and $\\Delta E_{\\mathrm{CB}}$ using the given numerical values. We can compare the dimensionless quantities $\\Delta E / \\gamma_{LV}$.\n$$ \\frac{\\Delta E_{\\mathrm{W}}}{\\gamma_{LV}} = -r \\cos\\theta_{Y} = -1.3 \\times (-0.5) = 0.65 $$\n$$ \\frac{\\Delta E_{\\mathrm{CB}}}{\\gamma_{LV}} = 1 - \\phi_s(1+\\cos\\theta_{Y}) = 1 - 0.08(1 - 0.5) = 1 - 0.08(0.5) = 1 - 0.04 = 0.96 $$\nSince $0.65  0.96$, we have $\\Delta E_{\\mathrm{W}}  \\Delta E_{\\mathrm{CB}}$. The Wenzel state has a lower interfacial free energy per unit projected area and is therefore the more stable state. This corresponds to the integer $s=0$.\n\nThe final answer is composed of the row matrix containing the computed values for $\\cos\\theta^{*}_{\\mathrm{W}}$, $\\cos\\theta^{*}_{\\mathrm{CB}}$, and the stability indicator $s$.\n$\\cos\\theta^{*}_{\\mathrm{W}} = -0.6500$\n$\\cos\\theta^{*}_{\\mathrm{CB}} = -0.9600$\n$s=0$", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{ \\begin{pmatrix} -0.6500  -0.9600  0 \\end{pmatrix} } $$", "id": "2797321"}]}
