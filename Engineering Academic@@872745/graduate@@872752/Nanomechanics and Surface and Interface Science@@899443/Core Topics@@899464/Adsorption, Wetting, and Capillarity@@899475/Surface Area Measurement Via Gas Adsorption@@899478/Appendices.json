It is deemed valid. A solution will be provided.\n\nThe assumptions given—uniform sites, no lateral interactions, monolayer adsorption—define the Langmuir model. At equilibrium, the rate of adsorption equals the rate of desorption. Alternatively, and more fundamentally, the chemical potential of the gas phase, $\\mu_{\\mathrm{gas}}$, must equal that of the adsorbed phase, $\\mu_{\\mathrm{ads}}$.\n\nThe chemical potential of the gas phase is given as\n$$ \\mu_{\\mathrm{gas}} = \\mu_{\\mathrm{gas}}^{0} + k_B T \\ln p $$\nwhere $\\mu_{\\mathrm{gas}}^{0}$ is the standard chemical potential of the gas, $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant, and $T$ is the absolute temperature.\n\nFor the adsorbed phase (an ideal lattice gas), the chemical potential is given by\n$$ \\mu_{\\mathrm{ads}} = \\mu_{\\mathrm{ads}}^{0} + k_B T \\ln\\left(\\frac{\\theta}{1-\\theta}\\right) $$\nwhere $\\mu_{\\mathrm{ads}}^{0}$ is the standard chemical potential of the adsorbed phase (related to the adsorption energy), and $\\theta = n/n_m$ is the fractional surface coverage, with $n$ being the amount adsorbed and $n_m$ being the monolayer capacity.\n\nAt equilibrium, $\\mu_{\\mathrm{gas}} = \\mu_{\\mathrm{ads}}$:\n$$ \\mu_{\\mathrm{gas}}^{0} + k_B T \\ln p = \\mu_{\\mathrm{ads}}^{0} + k_B T \\ln\\left(\\frac{\\theta}{1-\\theta}\\right) $$\nRearranging gives\n$$ \\ln\\left(\\frac{\\theta}{1-\\theta}\\right) = \\frac{\\mu_{\\mathrm{gas}}^{0} - \\mu_{\\mathrm{ads}}^{0}}{k_B T} + \\ln p $$\nLet $K = \\exp\\left(\\frac{\\mu_{\\mathrm{gas}}^{0} - \\mu_{\\mathrm{ads}}^{0}}{k_B T}\\right)$. This equilibrium constant $K$ is the affinity parameter. The equation becomes:\n$$ \\frac{\\theta}{1-\\theta} = Kp $$\nSolving for $\\theta$ yields the Langmuir isotherm:\n$$ \\theta = \\frac{Kp}{1+Kp} $$\nTo find $n_m$, we substitute $\\theta = n/n_m$:\n$$ \\frac{n}{n_m} = \\frac{Kp}{1+Kp} $$\nTo create a linear relationship from experimentally accessible variables ($p$ and $n$), we rearrange this equation. A common and useful linearization is obtained by taking the reciprocal and manipulating the expression:\n$$ \\frac{n_m}{n} = \\frac{1+Kp}{Kp} = \\frac{1}{Kp} + 1 $$\nMultiplying by $p$ gives:\n$$ \\frac{p n_m}{n} = \\frac{1}{K} + p $$\n$$ \\frac{p}{n} = \\frac{p}{n_m} + \\frac{1}{n_m K} $$\nThis equation is of the linear form $y = mx + c$, where $y = \\frac{p}{n}$, $x = p$, the slope is $m = \\frac{1}{n_m}$, and the y-intercept is $c = \\frac{1}{n_m K}$. The monolayer capacity $n_m$ can be determined from the slope of a plot of $\\frac{p}{n}$ versus $p$, without needing to know the affinity parameter $K$.\n\nNext, we process the experimental data to fit this linear model.\nThe given data $(p, n)$ are transformed into $(p, p/n)$:\n- $p = 5$, $n = 0.005995504 \\implies p/n \\approx 833.950$\n- $p = 10$, $n = 0.011982027 \\implies p/n \\approx 834.590$\n- $p = 20$, $n = 0.023928215 \\implies p/n \\approx 835.835$\n- $p = 40$, $n = 0.047713717 \\implies p/n \\approx 838.342$\n- $p = 60$, $n = 0.071357779 \\implies p/n \\approx 840.850$\n- $p = 80$, $n = 0.094861658 \\implies p/n \\approx 843.342$\n- $p = 100$, $n = 0.118226595 \\implies p/n \\approx 845.842$\n\nLet $x_i = p_i$ and $y_i = (p/n)_i$. A linear regression is performed on these $N=7$ data points to find the slope $m$.\nThe slope of the best-fit line is calculated as:\n$$ m = \\frac{N \\sum(x_i y_i) - (\\sum x_i)(\\sum y_i)}{N \\sum(x_i^2) - (\\sum x_i)^2} $$\nUsing the data:\n$\\sum x_i = 315$\n$\\sum y_i \\approx 5872.751$\n$\\sum x_i^2 = 22125$\n$\\sum x_i y_i \\approx 265268.5$\n\nPlugging these sums into the formula gives:\n$$ m = \\frac{7 \\times (265268.5) - (315) \\times (5872.751)}{7 \\times (22125) - (315)^2} = \\frac{1856879.5 - 1849923.9...}{154875 - 99225} = \\frac{6955.5...}{55650} \\approx 0.12499... $$\nA precise calculation yields $m \\approx 0.1249927$.\nThe monolayer capacity is the reciprocal of the slope:\n$$ n_m = \\frac{1}{m} \\approx \\frac{1}{0.1249927} \\approx 8.00045\\,\\mathrm{mmol\\,g^{-1}} $$\nRounding to four significant figures, we get $n_m = 8.000\\,\\mathrm{mmol\\,g^{-1}}$.\n\nFinally, we discuss the bias introduced by attractive lateral interactions. The Langmuir model assumes an interaction energy $\\omega = 0$ between adjacent adsorbates. For attractive interactions, $\\omega  0$. A first-order correction for this is the Fowler-Guggenheim model, where the isotherm is:\n$$ Kp = \\left(\\frac{\\theta}{1-\\theta}\\right) \\exp\\left(\\frac{z\\omega\\theta}{k_B T}\\right) $$\nwhere $z$ is the coordination number of an adsorption site.\nThe linearized Langmuir plot for this model is no longer linear. We analyze its initial behavior at low coverage ($\\theta \\to 0$, $p \\to 0$). The equation for the plot becomes:\n$$ \\frac{p}{n} = \\frac{p}{n_m \\theta} = \\frac{1}{n_m K(1-\\theta)}\\exp\\left(\\frac{z\\omega\\theta}{k_B T}\\right) $$\nThe slope of the plot $\\frac{p}{n}$ vs $p$ is $\\frac{d(p/n)}{dp}$. In the limit $p \\to 0$ (and $\\theta \\to 0$), this slope can be shown to be:\n$$ m_{est} = \\lim_{p \\to 0} \\frac{d(p/n)}{dp} = \\frac{1}{n_m}\\left(1 + \\frac{z\\omega}{k_B T}\\right) $$\nThe Langmuir analysis assumes the slope is $m = 1/n_m$. The linear regression on experimental data provides an estimate of the slope, $m_{est}$. The estimated monolayer capacity is $n_{m,est} = 1/m_{est}$.\n$$ n_{m,est} = \\frac{n_m}{1 + \\frac{z\\omega}{k_B T}} $$\nFor attractive interactions, $\\omega  0$. Since $z$, $k_B$, and $T$ are all positive, the term $\\frac{z\\omega}{k_B T}$ is negative. The denominator $(1 + \\frac{z\\omega}{k_B T})$ is therefore less than $1$. Consequently:\n$$ n_{m,est} > n_m $$\nThe estimate $n_{m,est}$ obtained by the non-interacting linearization is an **overestimate** of the true monolayer capacity $n_m$. The sign of the bias is positive.\nThe leading-order dependence of the bias, $\\Delta n_m = n_{m,est} - n_m$, on the interaction parameter can be found using the Taylor expansion $(1+x)^{-1} \\approx 1-x$ for small $x$:\n$$ n_{m,est} = n_m \\left(1 + \\frac{z\\omega}{k_B T}\\right)^{-1} \\approx n_m \\left(1 - \\frac{z\\omega}{k_B T}\\right) $$\nThe bias is:\n$$ \\Delta n_m = n_{m,est} - n_m \\approx -n_m \\frac{z\\omega}{k_B T} $$\nThe bias is directly proportional to the interaction parameter $\\omega$ (and inversely proportional to temperature $T$). The \"coverage\" dependence in the question likely refers to the fact that this analysis is based on the low-coverage limit.

The combination of a steep initial uptake in the isotherm (characteristic of IUPAC Type I isotherms) and a positive intercept on a t-plot is a classic and unambiguous indicator of the presence of micropores (pores of width less than $2\\,\\mathrm{nm}$). The stated non-linearity in the BET plot is the expected consequence of applying the BET model, which assumes layer-by-layer adsorption on an open surface, to a material where micropore filling is a dominant mechanism at low relative pressures. All provided data are internally consistent and scientifically sound. The problem is well-posed, asking for the correct interpretation and procedural choice based on established principles of surface science. The terminology is precise and objective. Therefore, the problem is valid.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. A full solution will be derived.\n\n**Derivation of Principles**\n\nThe Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) equation describes multilayer adsorption on a non-porous, energetically uniform surface. It is formulated as:\n$$ \\frac{x}{n(1-x)} = \\frac{1}{n_m C} + \\frac{C-1}{n_m C} x $$\nwhere $x$ is the relative pressure $P/P_0$, $n$ is the amount of gas adsorbed at pressure $P$, $n_m$ is the monolayer capacity (the amount of gas required to form a single molecular layer on the surface), and $C$ is the Brunauer constant, related to the net heat of adsorption in the first layer. A plot of the transformed quantity $x/(n(1-x))$ versus $x$ should yield a straight line, from whose slope $S = (C-1)/(n_m C)$ and intercept $I = 1/(n_m C)$ one can calculate $n_m$ and $C$. The specific surface area, $A_{BET}$, is then derived from $n_m$.\n\nThe core assumptions of the BET model are violated in the case of microporous materials. The steep initial uptake observed for $x \\lesssim 0.05$ is not due to monolayer formation but to micropore filling, a process where pores are filled at low pressures due to the enhanced adsorption potential from overlapping pore walls. Applying the BET equation to data points from this region is physically incorrect and will lead to an erroneous, often overestimated, surface area.\n\nThe t-plot method confirms this interpretation. A t-plot is constructed by plotting the amount adsorbed, $n$, against the statistical thickness, $t$, of the adsorbed film as determined from a standard isotherm on a non-porous reference material. For a material containing micropores, the plot exhibits a characteristic deviation from the origin: a positive intercept on the $n$-axis, which quantifies the amount of adsorbate in the micropores. The subsequent linear portion of the plot corresponds to multilayer adsorption on the external surface (including mesopore walls, if present), the slope of which is proportional to this external area. The observation of a \"positive intercept at $t=0$\" is a direct and definitive diagnosis of microporosity.\n\nGiven the confirmed presence of micropores, a meaningful BET surface area can only be obtained if the fitting range for the linear regression is carefully chosen to exclude the low-pressure region dominated by micropore filling. Modern IUPAC guidelines mandate a set of consistency criteria for selecting a valid range:\n1.  The chosen range must yield a positive value for the $C$ constant, as a negative $C$ is physically meaningless.\n2.  The quantity $n(1-x)$ must increase monotonically with $x$ over the chosen range. This is a mathematical consequence of the BET model and serves as a consistency check.\n3.  The pressure corresponding to the calculated monolayer coverage ($n_m$) must fall within the selected pressure range.\n\nThe non-linearity (\"upward curvature\") in the BET plot is the direct manifestation of the breakdown of the BET model's assumptions over a wide pressure range for this material. One must find a limited range where the model is a reasonable approximation for adsorption on the non-microporous parts of the surface.\n\n**Option-by-Option Analysis**\n\n**A) Include as much low-pressure data as possible to capture the monolayer, e.g., fit over $0.01 \\le x \\le 0.30$. If the least-squares line yields a negative Brunauer constant $C$ but high $R^2$, accept the fit because the curvature is slight and the monolayer is necessarily at very low $x$.**\nThis option is fundamentally incorrect. The process at $x=0.01$ is micropore filling, not monolayer formation as assumed by the BET model. Including these points is a violation of physical principles. A negative $C$ constant is physically nonsensical, indicating an invalid fit, regardless of the correlation coefficient $R^2$. Accepting such a result is a serious scientific error.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**B) Use the t-plot’s positive intercept to diagnose microporosity, then restrict the BET fit to the subset of points that satisfy physically consistent criteria (e.g., monotonic increase of $n(1-x)$ with $x$, positive $C$, and a monolayer point within the selected $x$ window). Exclude the low-$x$ region where micropore filling dominates (typically $x \\lesssim 0.07$ for nitrogen at $77\\,\\mathrm{K}$) and stop the fit before any onset of capillary condensation (e.g., $x \\lesssim 0.20$). Report the BET area from this adjusted range and, if needed, the external surface area from the t-plot slope.**\nThis option describes the correct and rigorous procedure according to modern standards (e.g., IUPAC 2015 recommendations). It correctly uses the t-plot for diagnosis, acknowledges the limitation of the BET model, and applies the necessary consistency criteria (often called the Rouquerol criteria) to find a physically meaningful fitting range. It correctly identifies the need to exclude the low-pressure micropore filling region and the higher-pressure region where other phenomena like capillary condensation may begin. The mention of using the t-plot to determine the external surface area is also correct and represents a complete characterization approach.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**C) First run a Barrett–Joyner–Halenda (BJH) analysis to remove micropore effects numerically, then extend the BET fit to a wide range $0.30 \\le x \\le 0.80$ to maximize linearity; the higher-$x$ data stabilize the slope and reduce noise from the low-$x$ region.**\nThis option demonstrates a profound misunderstanding of the techniques. The BJH method is used to calculate mesopore size distributions from the desorption branch of an isotherm in the capillary condensation regime (typically $x  0.4$). It has no function in \"removing micropore effects\" for a BET analysis. Furthermore, applying the BET equation in the range $0.30 \\le x \\le 0.80$ is a severe error, as this region is dominated by multilayer growth far from the monolayer and, increasingly, by capillary condensation in mesopores, which violates the BET assumptions entirely.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D) Force linearity in the BET plot by preferentially weighting low-$x$ points so the fit passes through the origin, accept $C \\to \\infty$ as a limiting case of strong adsorption, and compute the surface area from any resulting slope–intercept pair since microporosity only affects the very first few data points.**\nThis option proposes a series of arbitrary and incorrect manipulations. Forcing the fit through the origin is an unjustified constraint that corresponds to the special case of an infinite $C$ constant, which may not be appropriate. Preferentially weighting the low-pressure points is the exact opposite of the correct procedure for a microporous material, as this is the most physically invalid region for the BET model. The assertion that microporosity affects only \"the very first few data points\" is a gross oversimplification; its influence creates the non-linearity that complicates the analysis over a broader range. This approach prioritizes mathematical expediency over physical reality.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2790011"}, {"introduction": "A truly proficient experimentalist not only analyzes data but designs the experiment itself to yield the highest quality results.

Minimizing the uncertainty in $n_m$ requires minimizing the uncertainty in the measurement of the dependent variable, which is fundamentally determined by the uncertainty in the adsorbed amount, $n$.\n\nFirst, let's estimate the expected monolayer capacity for the given material. The specific surface area $S$ is related to the specific monolayer capacity $n_{m,s}$ (in mol/g) by:\n$$S = n_{m,s} N_A s$$\nGiven $S \\approx 800\\,\\mathrm{m^2\\,g^{-1}}$, $N_A = 6.022\\times 10^{23}\\,\\mathrm{mol^{-1}}$, and $s = 0.162\\,\\mathrm{nm^2} = 1.62 \\times 10^{-19}\\,\\mathrm{m^2}$, we find:\n$$n_{m,s} = \\frac{S}{N_A s} = \\frac{800\\,\\mathrm{m^2\\,g^{-1}}}{(6.022\\times 10^{23}\\,\\mathrm{mol^{-1}})(1.62 \\times 10^{-19}\\,\\mathrm{m^2})} \\approx 8.20 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{mol/g}$$\nFor a sample mass $m_s = 0.10\\,\\mathrm{g}$, the total monolayer capacity is $N_m = n_{m,s} m_s \\approx 8.20 \\times 10^{-4}\\,\\mathrm{mol}$. The mass of the adsorbed monolayer is $m_{mono} = N_m M_{\\mathrm{N_2}} = (8.20 \\times 10^{-4}\\,\\mathrm{mol})(28.01\\,\\mathrm{g/mol}) \\approx 0.023\\,\\mathrm{g} = 23000\\,\\mu\\mathrm{g}$. The amount adsorbed at each point in the BET range ($x = 0.05-0.30$) will be of this order of magnitude.\n\nWe will now analyze each option.\n\n**Option C: Volumetric plan: choose $V_d = 50\\,\\mathrm{cm^3}$, sample mass $m_s = 0.02\\,\\mathrm{g}$, acquire $N = 11$ points but concentrated at $x > 0.80$...**\n\nThis plan is fundamentally flawed.\n1.  **Incorrect Pressure Range:** The standard BET analysis is valid in the relative pressure range of approximately $x=0.05$ to $x=0.35$ for nitrogen on many materials. Measuring points at $x > 0.80$ is incorrect for determining the monolayer capacity via the standard BET equation, as capillary condensation dominates in this range for a mesoporous material.\n2.  **Poor Parameter Choices:** In volumetric analysis, the amount adsorbed is calculated by subtracting the amount of unadsorbed gas in the dead volume from the total amount of gas dosed. To minimize uncertainty, one must minimize the magnitude and uncertainty of the subtracted amount. This plan selects the largest dead volume, $V_d = 50\\,\\mathrm{cm^3}$, which maximizes the quantity of unadsorbed gas and thus maximizes the propagated uncertainty from pressure and temperature measurements. It also uses a small sample mass ($m_s = 0.02\\,\\mathrm{g}$), which minimizes the signal (adsorbed amount), leading to a poor signal-to-noise ratio. The justifications given are irrelevant to the goal of minimizing uncertainty.\n\nVerdict: **Incorrect**. This plan violates standard procedure and makes choices that maximize, rather than minimize, uncertainty.\n\n**Option D: Gravimetric plan: choose $m_s = 0.005\\,\\mathrm{g}$, neglect buoyancy correction..., use unweighted regression...**\n\nThis plan is also fundamentally flawed.\n1.  **Neglecting Buoyancy:** The buoyancy correction accounts for the upward force exerted by the surrounding gas on the sample. The mass equivalent of this buoyancy force is $m_B = V_s \\rho_{gas}(P, T)$, where $V_s$ is the skeletal volume of the sample and $\\rho_{gas}$ is the gas density. Let's estimate its magnitude. For silica, density is $\\rho_{silica} \\approx 2.2\\,\\mathrm{g/cm^3}$, so for $m_s = 0.005\\,\\mathrm{g}$, $V_s \\approx 0.005/2.2 \\approx 0.0023\\,\\mathrm{cm^3}$. At $T=77\\,\\mathrm{K}$ and maximum pressure $P = 0.30 \\cdot 760\\,\\mathrm{Torr} = 228\\,\\mathrm{Torr}$, the $\\mathrm{N_2}$ gas density is $\\rho_{gas} \\approx 1.34\\,\\mathrm{kg/m^3} = 0.00134\\,\\mathrm{g/cm^3}$. The buoyancy mass is $m_B \\approx (0.0023\\,\\mathrm{cm^3})(0.00134\\,\\mathrm{g/cm^3}) \\approx 3.1\\,\\mu\\mathrm{g}$. The total mass adsorbed for a full monolayer would be $m_{mono} = (23000\\,\\mu\\mathrm{g}) \\cdot (0.005/0.10) = 1150\\,\\mu\\mathrm{g}$. The buoyancy correction is $\\sim 3.1\\,\\mu\\mathrm{g}$, which is over $15$ times the balance noise ($\\sigma_m = 0.2\\,\\mu\\mathrm{g}$). Neglecting it introduces a significant, pressure-dependent systematic error that will lead to an inaccurate value of $n_m$.\n2.  **Small Sample Mass:** Using a very small sample mass ($m_s=0.005\\,\\mathrm{g}$) makes the measurement more susceptible to small absolute errors like the buoyancy effect and balance drift. While the justification about diffusion is physically plausible in some cases, the problem states that mass transfer limitations are negligible, rendering this point moot.\n3.  **Unweighted Regression:** Since the buoyancy force is pressure-dependent, the uncertainty in its correction would also be pressure-dependent, making unweighted regression statistically inappropriate.\n\nVerdict: **Incorrect**. This plan introduces a significant systematic error and uses a sample mass that is too small for a high-precision measurement.\n\n**Option A: Volumetric plan: choose $V_d = 5\\,\\mathrm{cm^3}$, sample mass $m_s = 0.10\\,\\mathrm{g}$... unweighted linear regression...**\n\nThis plan represents a reasonable strategy for the volumetric method.\n1.  **Good Parameter Choices:** It correctly selects the smallest available dead volume ($V_d = 5\\,\\mathrm{cm^3}$) to minimize the amount of unadsorbed gas. It also uses a substantial sample mass ($m_s = 0.10\\,\\mathrm{g}$) to maximize the signal (total adsorbed amount). These choices are consistent with minimizing measurement uncertainty.\n2.  **Limitation of the Method:** The volumetric method is indirect. It determines the adsorbed amount $n_{ads}$ by difference: $n_{ads} = n_{dosed} - n_{unadsorbed}$. This \"difference of large numbers\" can amplify uncertainties. The uncertainty in $n_{unadsorbed} = PV_d/RT$ is significant, especially due to the uncertainty in the dead volume calibration, $\\sigma_{V_d} = 0.05\\,\\mathrm{cm^3}$. This corresponds to a relative uncertainty $\\sigma_{V_d}/V_d = 0.05/5 = 1\\%$. This propagates as a major systematic error into the determination of $n_{ads}$ at each point. Furthermore, errors in the dosing steps are cumulative, increasing the uncertainty for points at higher pressures.\n\nVerdict: While this is the best possible plan utilizing the given volumetric instrument, its inherent methodological limitations suggest it may not be the overall best option. It is a contender that must be compared with the best gravimetric plan.\n\n**Option B: Gravimetric plan: choose $m_s = 0.10\\,\\mathrm{g}$, measure and use the skeletal volume $V_s$ for buoyancy correction..., perform a weighted linear regression...**\n\nThis plan represents the state-of-the-art for high-precision adsorption measurements.\n1.  **Direct Measurement:** The gravimetric method directly measures the mass uptake, $\\Delta m$. For a high-surface-area sample with $m_s = 0.10\\,\\mathrm{g}$, the expected adsorbed mass is large (${\\sim}23000\\,\\mu\\mathrm{g}$). The balance noise is very low ($\\sigma_m = 0.2\\,\\mu\\mathrm{g}$), providing an extremely high intrinsic signal-to-noise ratio.\n2.  **Proper Correction:** The plan correctly identifies the need for buoyancy correction and proposes to apply it. The uncertainty in this correction must be evaluated. The correction is $m_B = V_s \\rho_{gas}$. The main uncertainty in this term comes from $\\sigma_{V_s}=0.002\\,\\mathrm{cm^3}$. The skeletal volume is $V_s \\approx 0.10\\,\\mathrm{g} / (2.2\\,\\mathrm{g/cm^3}) \\approx 0.045\\,\\mathrm{cm^3}$. The uncertainty in the buoyancy mass correction is $\\sigma_{m_B} \\approx \\rho_{gas} \\sigma_{V_s}$. At $P=228\\,\\mathrm{Torr}$, $\\sigma_{m_B} \\approx (0.00134\\,\\mathrm{g/cm^3})(0.002\\,\\mathrm{cm^3}) \\approx 2.7\\,\\mu\\mathrm{g}$. This uncertainty is larger than the balance noise but still a very small fraction (${\\sim}0.01\\%$) of the total adsorbed mass signal.\n3.  **Optimal Statistical Treatment:** The use of a weighted linear regression is the statistically correct procedure to obtain the best estimate for the fit parameters and their uncertainty. The weights are the inverse of the variance of the dependent variable at each point. Since the uncertainty of the buoyancy correction is pressure-dependent, the total uncertainty per point is not constant. Acknowledging this and using the appropriate regression technique is critical for minimizing the final uncertainty in $n_m$.\n\n**Comparison of Plan A and Plan B:**\n\n*   **Error Source:** Gravimetric is a direct measurement of adsorbed mass, while volumetric is an indirect measurement by difference. Direct measurements are generally more precise.\n*   **Random Noise:** The random noise in the gravimetric measurement is dominated by the balance noise, $\\sigma_m = 0.2\\,\\mu\\mathrm{g}$. The random noise in the volumetric measurement comes from pressure and temperature fluctuations in both the dosing manifold and the sample cell; its propagation leads to a significantly larger noise floor, on the order of ${\\sim}1.5\\,\\mu\\mathrm{g}$ equivalent mass, and this error accumulates with each dose.\n*   **Systematic Error:** The dominant systematic error in the volumetric plan is from the dead volume uncertainty $\\sigma_{V_d}$, which translates to a pressure-dependent error in the amount adsorbed of up to ${\\sim}50\\,\\mu\\mathrm{g}$ equivalent mass in the BET range. The dominant systematic error in the gravimetric plan is from the skeletal volume uncertainty $\\sigma_{V_s}$, which translates to an error in the buoyancy correction of up to ${\\sim}2.7\\,\\mu\\mathrm{g}$. The systematic error is an order of magnitude smaller for the gravimetric method.\n*   **Data Analysis:** Plan B proposes the use of weighted linear regression, which is a more rigorous and accurate statistical method than the unweighted regression proposed in Plan A, especially when per-point errors are not constant.\n\nConclusion: Due to its direct measurement principle, lower random noise, smaller systematic errors, and use of a more sophisticated statistical analysis, the gravimetric plan (B) is unequivocally superior to the volumetric plan (A) for minimizing the combined standard uncertainty in $n_m$.\n\nVerdict: **Correct**. This is the optimal experimental plan among the choices provided.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2789942"}]}
