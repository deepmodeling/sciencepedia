{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "Aliasing is often first encountered through visual illusions like the 'wagon-wheel effect,' where a rapidly spinning wheel appears to slow down, stop, or even rotate backward on film. This phenomenon, known as the stroboscopic effect, is a perfect physical analogy for aliasing in signal processing. This exercise lets you quantify this effect, calculating the apparent frequency and direction of rotation of a dot on a spinning disk when viewed under a strobe light, providing an intuitive foundation for more abstract signal processing concepts [@problem_id:1695489].", "problem": "In a dark room, a flat, circular disk of negligible thickness is rotating in a counter-clockwise direction about its center at a constant frequency of $f_0 = 30$ Hz. A single, small reflective dot is painted on the edge of the disk. At time $t=0$, the dot is located at the 3 o'clock position (the rightmost point on its circular path). The disk is illuminated by a stroboscopic light, which produces instantaneous flashes at a constant frequency of $f_s = 40$ Hz. An observer, whose perception is constructed solely from the sequence of these flashes, observes the dot. Due to the stroboscopic effect, the dot will appear to be rotating at a new, constant frequency, which we define as the apparent frequency, $f_{app}$.\n\nDetermine the value of this apparent frequency, $f_{app}$. By convention, a positive frequency corresponds to counter-clockwise rotation (the original direction), and a negative frequency corresponds to clockwise rotation (the reversed direction).\n\nExpress your answer in Hz. Your answer should be a single real number.", "solution": "Let the disk rotate with angular speed $\\omega_{0} = 2\\pi f_{0}$ and the strobe flash with period $T_{s} = \\frac{1}{f_{s}}$. The angular advance of the dot between successive flashes is\n$$\n\\Delta \\theta = \\omega_{0} T_{s} = 2\\pi \\frac{f_{0}}{f_{s}}.\n$$\nThe observer perceives positions modulo $2\\pi$, so the effective step per flash is\n$$\n\\Delta \\theta_{\\text{app}} = \\Delta \\theta - 2\\pi m,\n$$\nwhere $m \\in \\mathbb{Z}$ is chosen so that $\\Delta \\theta_{\\text{app}} \\in (-\\pi, \\pi]$, corresponding to the slowest apparent motion. The apparent angular speed is then\n$$\n\\omega_{\\text{app}} = \\Delta \\theta_{\\text{app}} f_{s},\n$$\nand the corresponding apparent frequency is\n$$\nf_{\\text{app}} = \\frac{\\omega_{\\text{app}}}{2\\pi} = \\left(\\frac{\\Delta \\theta_{\\text{app}}}{2\\pi}\\right) f_{s} = \\left(\\frac{f_{0}}{f_{s}} - m\\right) f_{s} = f_{0} - m f_{s}.\n$$\nTo determine $m$, choose the integer that makes $|f_{\\text{app}}|$ minimal, equivalently $m = \\operatorname{round}\\!\\left(\\frac{f_{0}}{f_{s}}\\right)$. With $f_{0} = 30$ and $f_{s} = 40$,\n$$\n\\frac{f_{0}}{f_{s}} = \\frac{30}{40} = \\frac{3}{4},\n$$\nso $m = 1$. Therefore,\n$$\nf_{\\text{app}} = 30 - 1 \\cdot 40 = -10.\n$$\nThe negative sign indicates clockwise apparent rotation. This also matches the per-flash step: $\\Delta \\theta = 2\\pi \\cdot \\frac{3}{4} = \\frac{3\\pi}{2}$, which is equivalent to $-\\frac{\\pi}{2}$, i.e., a clockwise step of a quarter turn per flash, yielding $f_{\\text{app}} = -10$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{-10}$$", "id": "1695489"}, {"introduction": "Moving from visual analogies to practical engineering, aliasing is a critical concern in digital monitoring and data acquisition systems. When a sensor samples a physical process—like the rotation of an engine component—at a rate less than twice the component's frequency, the resulting digital data will misrepresent the true behavior. This practice problem simulates such a scenario, challenging you to calculate the incorrect, 'aliased' frequency that a monitoring system would report, highlighting the importance of the Nyquist-Shannon sampling theorem in real-world applications [@problem_id:1695469].", "problem": "A mechanical component in an engine testing rig is rotating at a constant frequency of $f_{rot} = 170$ Hz. A digital monitoring system uses a sensor to record the component's angular position. The sensor samples the position at a rate of $f_s = 200$ Hz. Due to limitations in the data acquisition hardware, this sampling rate cannot be changed. The monitoring software, which assumes that the input signal frequency is less than or equal to half the sampling rate, will consequently display an aliased frequency for the component's rotation based on the sampled data. What is the magnitude of this aliased frequency? Express your answer in Hz, and round to three significant figures.", "solution": "We use the sampling/aliasing principle: when a continuous-time sinusoid of frequency $f$ is sampled at rate $f_{s}$, its discrete-time spectrum contains replicas at $f - k f_{s}$ for all integers $k$. The frequency observed by a system that assumes the input is band-limited to the Nyquist interval $[0, \\frac{f_{s}}{2}]$ is the baseband alias given by\n$$\nf_{\\text{alias}}=\\left|f - k f_{s}\\right|,\n$$\nwhere $k \\in \\mathbb{Z}$ is chosen so that $f_{\\text{alias}} \\in \\left[0, \\frac{f_{s}}{2}\\right]$.\n\nGiven $f_{\\text{rot}}=170$ and $f_{s}=200$, first note the Nyquist frequency:\n$$\n\\frac{f_{s}}{2}=100.\n$$\nSince $f_{\\text{rot}} \\in \\left(\\frac{f_{s}}{2}, f_{s}\\right)$, choose $k=1$ to fold into the Nyquist interval:\n$$\nf_{\\text{alias}}=\\left|f_{\\text{rot}}-1\\cdot f_{s}\\right|=\\left|170-200\\right|=30.\n$$\nThis lies within $\\left[0, \\frac{f_{s}}{2}\\right]$, so it is the magnitude reported by the monitoring software.

This specific case, where $f_0 = f_s/2$, leads to a unique and informative type of aliasing that is fundamental to understanding digital signals. In this problem, you will work backward from a distinctive, alternating digital sequence to determine the original signal's frequency, solidifying your understanding of the Nyquist frequency as the highest frequency that can be unambiguously captured by a given sampling rate [@problem_id:1695509].", "problem": "An audio engineer is testing an Analog-to-Digital Converter (ADC).
