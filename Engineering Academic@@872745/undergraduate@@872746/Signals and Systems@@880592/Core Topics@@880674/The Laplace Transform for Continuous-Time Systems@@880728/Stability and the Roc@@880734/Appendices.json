For a rational $H(z)$, the Region of Convergence (ROC) is an annulus in the $z$-plane bounded by pole magnitudes and cannot include any pole.\n\nStandard properties for rational LTI systems:\n- If $h[n]$ is right-sided (causal), then the ROC is of the form $|z|r_{\\max}$, where $r_{\\max}$ is the magnitude of the outermost pole.\n- If $h[n]$ is left-sided (anti-causal), then the ROC is of the form $|z|r_{\\min}$, where $r_{\\min}$ is the magnitude of the innermost pole.\n- If $h[n]$ is two-sided (non-causal), then the ROC is a ring between poles: $r_{\\min}|z|r_{\\max}$.\n- BIBO stability holds if and only if the impulse response is absolutely summable, which for rational systems is equivalent to the ROC including the unit circle $|z|=1$.\n\nWith poles at magnitudes $0.8$ and $1.2$, the only possible ROCs are:\n1) $|z|1.2$ (right-sided/causal).

This matches option C. All other options either assert stability with an ROC that excludes the unit circle or claim the system cannot be stable because of a pole outside the unit circle, which is incorrect for non-causal two-sided realizations as long as the unit circle lies in the ROC and no pole lies on it.\n\nThus, the correct choice is C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1754186"}, {"introduction": "Building on the previous concepts, this final practice requires you to work backward from a critical design constraint: stability. Given a system's transfer function, you must first deduce the correct ROC that guarantees a stable system and then determine the unique, non-causal impulse response associated with it [@problem_id:1754167]. This task integrates partial fraction expansion with the rules of the inverse Z-transform for different types of ROCs, a key skill in filter analysis and implementation.", "problem": "A discrete-time Linear Time-Invariant (LTI) system, used in a specialized signal filtering application, is characterized by its rational z-transform, which defines the system's transfer function $H(z)$. The transfer function is given by:\n$$H(z) = \\frac{1}{(1 - 0.5z^{-1})(1 - 3z^{-1})}$$\nIt is known from system design specifications that this filter must be stable. The Region of Convergence (ROC) of $H(z)$ is the set of complex numbers $z$ for which the z-transform sum converges. Your task is to determine the unique impulse response $h[n]$ of this stable system.\n\nFor your final answer, use the notation $u[n]$ to represent the discrete-time unit step function, which is defined as $u[n] = 1$ for $n \\geq 0$ and $u[n] = 0$ for $n  0$.

The boundaries of the ROC are determined by the poles of the system. For a system with two real-valued poles at $0.5$ and $3$, there are three possible ROCs:\n1. $|z|  3$: The ROC is outside the outermost pole. This corresponds to a causal, unstable system because the ROC does not include the unit circle.\n2. $|z|  0.5$: The ROC is inside the innermost pole. This corresponds to an anti-causal, unstable system because the ROC does not include the unit circle.\n3. $0.5  |z|  3$: The ROC is an annular region between the two poles. This corresponds to a two-sided, stable system because the unit circle ($|z|=1$) is contained within this region.\n\nSince the problem states that the system is stable, its ROC must be $0.5  |z|  3$.\n\nTo find the impulse response $h[n]$, we first perform a partial fraction expansion of $H(z)$.\n$$H(z) = \\frac{A}{1 - 0.5z^{-1}} + \\frac{B}{1 - 3z^{-1}}$$\nWe solve for the coefficients $A$ and $B$.\nTo find $A$, we multiply $H(z)$ by $(1 - 0.5z^{-1})$ and evaluate at the value of $z^{-1}$ that makes this term zero, which is $z^{-1}=2$.\n$$A = \\left. \\frac{1}{(1-3z^{-1})} \\right|_{z^{-1}=2} = \\frac{1}{1 - 3(2)} = \\frac{1}{1 - 6} = -\\frac{1}{5}$$\nTo find $B$, we multiply $H(z)$ by $(1 - 3z^{-1})$ and evaluate at $z^{-1}=1/3$.\n$$B = \\left. \\frac{1}{(1-0.5z^{-1})} \\right|_{z^{-1}=1/3} = \\frac{1}{1 - 0.5(1/3)} = \\frac{1}{1 - 1/6} = \\frac{1}{5/6} = \\frac{6}{5}$$\nSo, the partial fraction expansion is:\n$$H(z) = \\underbrace{\\frac{-1/5}{1 - 0.5z^{-1}}}_{H_1(z)} + \\underbrace{\\frac{6/5}{1 - 3z^{-1}}}_{H_2(z)}$$\nNow, we find the inverse z-transform of each term, keeping the overall ROC ($0.5  |z|  3$) in mind.\n\nFor the first term, $H_1(z)$, the pole is at $z=0.5$. The ROC for the entire system, $0.5  |z|  3$, satisfies $|z|0.5$. An ROC of the form $|z||a|$ corresponds to a right-sided (causal) sequence. The standard inverse z-transform pair is:\n$$a^n u[n] \\quad \\Leftrightarrow \\quad \\frac{1}{1-az^{-1}}, \\quad \\text{for ROC } |z||a|$$\nApplying this pair with $a=0.5$, we get the inverse transform of $H_1(z)$:\n$$h_1[n] = -\\frac{1}{5} (0.5)^n u[n]$$\n\nFor the second term, $H_2(z)$, the pole is at $z=3$.
