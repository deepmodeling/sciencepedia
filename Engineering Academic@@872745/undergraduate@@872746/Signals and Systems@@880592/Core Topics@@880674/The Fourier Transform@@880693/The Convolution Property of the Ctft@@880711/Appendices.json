While both the system and the output are non-causal, the non-causality of the output is not the *reason* for the non-causality of the system. A causal system with a non-causal input (one that exists for $t < 0$) can produce a non-causal output. The reasoning is flawed.\nC. A complex transfer function is typical for most systems and does not in itself determine causality. Causality is determined by the properties of its inverse Fourier transform, $h(t)$. False.\nD. This statement is correct. We have explicitly shown that the impulse response $h(t)$ is non-zero for $t < 0$, which is the definition of a non-causal system.\nE. The impulse response is not a product of a causal function and a decaying exponential. It is non-zero for $t<0$. Therefore, the system is not causal.
