The filter's behavior is fully characterized by its impulse response, which describes the system's output when the input is a single, infinitesimally brief pulse at time zero.\n\nThe impulse response for this specific filter is given by the discrete-time signal $h[n] = a^{n} u[n]$, where $n$ is the integer time index.

The ESD, denoted $E_h(\\omega)$, is defined as the squared magnitude of the Discrete-Time Fourier Transform (DTFT) of the signal. Let $H(\\omega)$ be the DTFT of $h[n]$. Then, the ESD is given by $E_h(\\omega) = |H(\\omega)|^2$.\n\nFirst, we must compute the DTFT of $h[n]$. The definition of the DTFT is:\n$$H(\\omega) = \\sum_{n=-\\infty}^{\\infty} h[n] \\exp(-j\\omega n)$$\nSubstituting the given signal $h[n] = a^{n} u[n]$ into the formula:\n$$H(\\omega) = \\sum_{n=-\\infty}^{\\infty} a^{n} u[n] \\exp(-j\\omega n)$$\nThe unit step function $u[n]$ is zero for $n < 0$ and one for $n \\ge 0$.

A geometric series of the form $\\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} r^k$ converges to $\\frac{1}{1-r}$ if and only if $|r| < 1$.\n\nLet's check the magnitude of the common ratio $r$:\n$$|r| = |a \\exp(-j\\omega)| = |a| \\cdot |\\exp(-j\\omega)|$$\nThe magnitude of the complex exponential $\\exp(-j\\omega)$ is always 1, because $|\\exp(-j\\omega)| = |\\cos(-\\omega) + j\\sin(-\\omega)| = \\sqrt{\\cos^2(\\omega) + \\sin^2(\\omega)} = 1$.\nTherefore, $|r| = |a|$. The problem statement specifies that $|a| < 1$, so the convergence condition is met. We can apply the formula for the sum of an infinite geometric series:\n$$H(\\omega) = \\frac{1}{1 - a \\exp(-j\\omega)}$$\nNow that we have the DTFT, $H(\\omega)$, we can find the ESD, $E_h(\\omega)$, by calculating its squared magnitude.\n$$E_h(\\omega) = |H(\\omega)|^2 = \\left| \\frac{1}{1 - a \\exp(-j\\omega)} \\right|^2 = \\frac{|1|^2}{|1 - a \\exp(-j\\omega)|^2} = \\frac{1}{|1 - a \\exp(-j\\omega)|^2}$$\nTo compute the squared magnitude of the denominator, we use the property that for any complex number $z$, $|z|^2 = z \\cdot z^*$, where $z^*$ is the complex conjugate.\nLet $z = 1 - a \\exp(-j\\omega)$. Then its complex conjugate is $z^* = 1 - a \\exp(+j\\omega)$, since $a$ is real.\n$$|1 - a \\exp(-j\\omega)|^2 = (1 - a \\exp(-j\\omega))(1 - a \\exp(j\\omega))$$\nExpanding this product:\n$$= 1 - a \\exp(j\\omega) - a \\exp(-j\\omega) + (a \\exp(-j\\omega))(a \\exp(j\\omega))$$\n$$= 1 - a(\\exp(j\\omega) + \\exp(-j\\omega)) + a^2 \\exp(0)$$\n$$= 1 - a(\\exp(j\\omega) + \\exp(-j\\omega)) + a^2$$\nUsing Euler's formula, we know that $\\cos(\\omega) = \\frac{\\exp(j\\omega) + \\exp(-j\\omega)}{2}$, which implies $\\exp(j\\omega) + \\exp(-j\\omega) = 2\\cos(\\omega)$.\nSubstituting this into the expression:\n$$|1 - a \\exp(-j\\omega)|^2 = 1 + a^2 - 2a\\cos(\\omega)$$\nFinally, we substitute this result back into the expression for the ESD:\n$$E_h(\\omega) = \\frac{1}{1 + a^2 - 2a\\cos(\\omega)}$$\nThis is the final expression for the energy spectral density of the given impulse response.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{1}{1 + a^{2} - 2a\\cos(\\omega)}}$$", "id": "1717189"}, {"introduction": "Moving to the continuous-time domain, this problem explores how the arrangement of a signal in time impacts its frequency content.
