We first identify the poles and zeros of $H(s)$. The zeros are the roots of the numerator polynomial, located at $s=1$ and $s=-2$. The poles are the roots of the denominator polynomial, located at $s=-1$ and $s=-3$. As the poles are at $-1$ and $-3$, they both lie in the open left half-plane (LHP), specifically $\\text{Re}(s)  0$. This is consistent with the condition that the causal LTI system must be stable.\n\nA causal, stable LTI system is defined as minimum-phase if all of its zeros also lie in the open LHP. We examine the zeros of $H(s)$: one zero is at $s=-2$, which is in the LHP. The other zero is at $s=1$, which is in the open right half-plane (RHP), as $\\text{Re}(s)  0$. Therefore, the structural feature that prevents $H(s)$ from being minimum-phase is the presence of this RHP zero at $s=1$.\n\nThe task is to find a decomposition $H(s) = H_{\\text{min}}(s)H_{\\text{ap}}(s)$, where $H_{\\text{min}}(s)$ is minimum-phase and $H_{\\text{ap}}(s)$ is an all-pass filter. An all-pass filter $H_{\\text{ap}}(s)$ is, by definition, a stable transfer function for which the magnitude of its frequency response is constant and equal to unity for all real frequencies $\\omega$, i.e., $|H_{\\text{ap}}(j\\omega)|=1$.\n\nThe underlying principle for this decomposition is that the squared magnitude of the frequency response, $|H(j\\omega)|^2$, depends on the locations of the poles and zeros, but it is invariant to the sign of the real part of these poles and zeros. Specifically, for any pole or zero $p_k$ or $z_k$, the squared magnitude response contains terms of the form $|j\\omega - z_k|^2$ and $1/|j\\omega - p_k|^2$. For a real zero at $s=z_0=\\sigma_0$, the magnitude contribution is from the factor $(s-\\sigma_0)$. On the imaginary axis $s=j\\omega$, the squared magnitude is $|j\\omega - \\sigma_0|^2 = \\omega^2 + \\sigma_0^2$. If we reflect this zero across the imaginary axis to $s=-\\sigma_0$, the new factor is $(s+\\sigma_0)$, and its squared magnitude is $|j\\omega + \\sigma_0|^2 = \\omega^2 + \\sigma_0^2$. The magnitudes are identical. This allows us to replace an RHP zero with a LHP zero without altering the magnitude response $|H(j\\omega)|$.\n\nWe construct the minimum-phase factor $H_{\\text{min}}(s)$ by taking all poles and LHP zeros of $H(s)$ and reflecting all RHP zeros of $H(s)$ into the LHP.\nThe poles of $H(s)$ are at $s=-1$ and $s=-3$, both in the LHP. So the denominator of $H_{\\text{min}}(s)$ is $(s+1)(s+3)$.\nThe LHP zero of $H(s)$ is at $s=-2$. This is retained in $H_{\\text{min}}(s)$.\nThe RHP zero of $H(s)$ is at $s=1$. This must be reflected into the LHP to $s=-1$.\nThus, the numerator of $H_{\\text{min}}(s)$ is $(s+2)(s+1)$.\n\nCombining these, the minimum-phase factor is:\n$$H_{\\text{min}}(s) = \\frac{(s+2)(s+1)}{(s+1)(s+3)} = \\frac{s+2}{s+3}$$\nThis system $H_{\\text{min}}(s)$ is stable (pole at $s=-3$ is in LHP) and minimum-phase (zero at $s=-2$ is in LHP).\n\nNext, we construct the all-pass factor $H_{\\text{ap}}(s)$ using the required relation $H(s) = H_{\\text{min}}(s)H_{\\text{ap}}(s)$. We solve for $H_{\\text{ap}}(s)$:\n$$H_{\\text{ap}}(s) = \\frac{H(s)}{H_{\\text{min}}(s)} = \\frac{\\frac{(s-1)(s+2)}{(s+1)(s+3)}}{\\frac{s+2}{s+3}}$$\n$$H_{\\text{ap}}(s) = \\frac{(s-1)(s+2)}{(s+1)(s+3)} \\cdot \\frac{s+3}{s+2} = \\frac{s-1}{s+1}$$\nThis is the candidate for our all-pass filter. We must verify its properties.\n$1$. Stability: The pole of $H_{\\text{ap}}(s)$ is at $s=-1$, which is in the LHP. The filter is stable.\n$2$. All-pass magnitude response: We evaluate its magnitude on the imaginary axis, $s=j\\omega$:\n$$|H_{\\text{ap}}(j\\omega)| = \\left|\\frac{j\\omega-1}{j\\omega+1}\\right| = \\frac{|j\\omega-1|}{|j\\omega+1|}$$\nThe magnitude of the numerator is $|-1+j\\omega| = \\sqrt{(-1)^2 + \\omega^2} = \\sqrt{1+\\omega^2}$.\nThe magnitude of the denominator is $|1+j\\omega| = \\sqrt{1^2 + \\omega^2} = \\sqrt{1+\\omega^2}$.\n$$|H_{\\text{ap}}(j\\omega)| = \\frac{\\sqrt{1+\\omega^2}}{\\sqrt{1+\\omega^2}} = 1$$\nThe magnitude is unity for all real $\\omega$. Thus, $H_{\\text{ap}}(s) = \\frac{s-1}{s+1}$ is indeed a stable, all-pass filter.\n\nThe decomposition is therefore:\n$$H(s) = \\underbrace{\\left(\\frac{s+2}{s+3}\\right)}_{H_{\\text{min}}(s)} \\underbrace{\\left(\\frac{s-1}{s+1}\\right)}_{H_{\\text{ap}}(s)}$$\nThe nonminimum-phase component within this factorization is the all-pass factor $H_{\\text{ap}}(s)$. It is this factor that contains the RHP zero at $s=1$ from the original system $H(s)$ and contributes all of the \"non-minimum\" phase shift to the total phase response, while having a unity gain.\n\nThe final expressions are:\n$H_{\\text{min}}(s) = \\frac{s+2}{s+3}$\n$H_{\\text{ap}}(s) = \\frac{s-1}{s+1}$", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{aligned}\nH_{\\text{min}}(s) = \\frac{s+2}{s+3} \\\\\nH_{\\text{ap}}(s) = \\frac{s-1}{s+1}\n\\end{aligned}\n}\n$$", "id": "2880812"}]}
