A filter must be causal to operate in real-time, meaning its output cannot depend on future inputs. It must also be stable to ensure that a bounded input signal always produces a bounded output. This exercise provides a foundational check, using the Z-transform to verify if a given filter's transfer function and its associated Region of Convergence (ROC) satisfy these two essential properties [@problem_id:1746807].", "problem": "An engineer is designing a real-time digital filter to process an incoming stream of sensor data. The filter is a Linear Time-Invariant (LTI) system whose input-output relationship is characterized by the transfer function $H(z)$ in the Z-domain.

Let $k = -n$. As $n$ goes from $0$ to $-\\infty$, the new index $k$ goes from $0$ to $\\infty$. Substituting $n = -k$ into the sum:\n$$ S = \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} 2^{-k} = \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^k $$\nThis is a standard geometric series of the form $\\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} r^k$ with the common ratio $r = 1/2$.
