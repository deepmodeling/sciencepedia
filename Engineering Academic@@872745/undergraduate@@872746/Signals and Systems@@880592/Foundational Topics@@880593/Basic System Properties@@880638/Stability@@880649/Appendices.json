This is a second-order linear time-invariant system. The stability of such a system is determined by the roots of its characteristic equation, which correspond to the poles of its transfer function.\n\nFirst, let's analyze the homogeneous equation, which describes the system's natural response:\n$$\ny_h''(t) + 9y_h(t) = 0\n$$\nTo find the solution, we assume a solution of the form $y_h(t) = e^{st}$ and substitute it into the equation, which gives the characteristic equation:\n$$\ns^2 + 9 = 0\n$$\nSolving for $s$, we get:\n$$\ns^2 = -9 \\implies s = \\pm j3\n$$\nThe roots of the characteristic equation are purely imaginary and distinct ($s_1 = j3$, $s_2 = -j3$).

In the context of Bounded-Input, Bounded-Output (BIBO) stability, a system is stable if all poles are in the left half of the complex s-plane. If any pole is in the right half-plane, the system is unstable. If there are distinct poles on the imaginary axis (and no poles in the right-half plane), the system is marginally stable. Our system fits this description.\n\nA marginally stable system exhibits an unbounded output when subjected to a bounded input signal whose frequency content matches one of the system's natural frequencies (the imaginary part of the poles). This phenomenon is known as resonance. The natural frequencies of our system correspond to the magnitudes of the imaginary parts of the poles, which is $\\omega_n = 3$ rad/s.\n\nTherefore, an input signal with an angular frequency of $\\omega = 3$ rad/s will cause resonance and produce an unbounded output.
