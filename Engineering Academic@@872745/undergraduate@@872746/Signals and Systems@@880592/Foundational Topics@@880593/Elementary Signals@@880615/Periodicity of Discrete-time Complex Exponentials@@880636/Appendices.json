The signals $x_A[n]$ and $x_B[n]$ are the homogeneous solutions to their respective Linear Constant-Coefficient Difference Equations (LCCDEs). The fundamental period of the sum of two periodic signals is the least common multiple (lcm) of their individual fundamental periods. Our first step is to find the fundamental periods of $x_A[n]$ and $x_B[n]$.\n\nA general second-order homogeneous LCCDE of the form $x[n] + a_1 x[n-1] + a_2 x[n-2] = 0$ has a characteristic equation $r^2 + a_1 r + a_2 = 0$. The nature of the solution $x[n]$ depends on the roots of this equation. For an oscillatory (sinusoidal) solution, the roots must be a complex conjugate pair with magnitude 1. Let the roots be $r_{1,2} = e^{\\pm j\\omega_0}$. The characteristic equation is then $(r - e^{j\\omega_0})(r - e^{-j\\omega_0}) = r^2 - (e^{j\\omega_0} + e^{-j\\omega_0})r + 1 = r^2 - (2\\cos\\omega_0)r + 1 = 0$.

The fundamental period is the smallest positive integer $N_0$ that satisfies this relationship when the fraction $k/N$ is reduced to its lowest terms (i.e., $\\gcd(k, N) = 1$). In that case, the fundamental period is $N_0 = N$.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze Subsystem A**\n\nThe characteristic equation for the LCCDE $x_A[n] - \\alpha x_A[n-1] + x_A[n-2] = 0$ is $r^2 - \\alpha r + 1 = 0$. The roots for an oscillatory solution are $e^{\\pm j\\omega_A}$, and the sum of the roots $2\\cos(\\omega_A)$ must equal $\\alpha$.\nGiven $\\alpha = \\frac{1-\\sqrt{5}}{2}$, we have:\n$$ 2\\cos(\\omega_A) = \\frac{1-\\sqrt{5}}{2} \\implies \\cos(\\omega_A) = \\frac{1-\\sqrt{5}}{4} $$\nThis value corresponds to the angle $\\omega_A = \\frac{3\\pi}{5}$, since $\\cos(3\\pi/5) = -\\cos(2\\pi/5) = -\\frac{\\sqrt{5}-1}{4}$.\n\nTo find the fundamental period $N_A$, we compute the ratio of the frequency to $2\\pi$:\n$$ \\frac{\\omega_A}{2\\pi} = \\frac{3\\pi/5}{2\\pi} = \\frac{3}{10} $$\nSince $\\gcd(3, 10) = 1$, the fraction is irreducible.

Since $\\gcd(5, 12) = 1$, the fraction is irreducible. The fundamental period of $x_B[n]$ is therefore $N_B = 12$.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the Period of the Composite Signal**\n\nThe composite signal is $z[n] = x_A[n] + x_B[n]$. The signal $x_A[n]$ is periodic with fundamental period $N_A = 10$, and the signal $x_B[n]$ is periodic with fundamental period $N_B = 12$.\nThe fundamental period of the sum of two periodic signals is the least common multiple (lcm) of their individual fundamental periods.\n$$ N_z = \\text{lcm}(N_A, N_B) = \\text{lcm}(10, 12) $$\nTo calculate the lcm, we can use the prime factorization of each number:\n$$ 10 = 2^1 \\cdot 5^1 $$\n$$ 12 = 2^2 \\cdot 3^1 $$\nThe lcm is found by taking the highest power of each prime factor present in either factorization and multiplying them together.\n$$ \\text{lcm}(10, 12) = 2^{\\max(1,2)} \\cdot 3^{\\max(0,1)} \\cdot 5^{\\max(1,0)} = 2^2 \\cdot 3^1 \\cdot 5^1 = 4 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 5 = 60 $$\nThus, the fundamental period of the composite signal $z[n]$ is 60.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{60}$$", "id": "1741207"}, {"introduction": "In theoretical work, we often assume perfect precision, but real-world digital systems operate with finite-precision numbers.

This means the value is greater than halfway between the two representable numbers, so we must round up.\nThe 23rd bit of the fraction is `0`.
