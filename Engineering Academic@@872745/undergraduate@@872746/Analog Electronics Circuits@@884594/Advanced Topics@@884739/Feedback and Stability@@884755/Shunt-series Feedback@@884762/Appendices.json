The feedback factor is defined as the ratio of the feedback signal to the output signal, $\\beta = I_f / I_o$.\n\nTo find $\\beta$ for a given feedback network, we must follow a specific procedure based on the feedback topology. For a current-shunt topology (also known as shunt-series), the output signal is a current ($I_o$) that is sampled in series, and the feedback signal is a current ($I_f$) that is mixed in shunt at the input.\n\nThe procedure to calculate $\\beta$ is as follows:\n1.  Isolate the passive feedback network.\n2.  Apply the output signal, the current $I_o$, to the output port of the feedback network. The output port is where the network connects to the main amplifier to sample the output signal.\n3.  Set the input port of the feedback network to the condition seen by the feedback signal. Since the mixing is in shunt (current mixing), the input node is a summing junction for currents. The ideal impedance of a current-summing node is zero. Therefore, we short-circuit the input port of the feedback network to ground.\n4.  Calculate the resulting feedback current, $I_f$, that flows out of the short-circuited input port.\n5.  The feedback factor is the ratio $\\beta = I_f / I_o$.\n\nLet's apply this procedure to the given circuit.\n\nThe feedback network consists of the resistors $R_S$ and $R_F$.\nThe output signal is the drain/source current $I_o$. This current is sampled by being passed through the source resistor $R_S$. Thus, the output port of the feedback network is the node connected to the MOSFET's source terminal (the junction of $R_S$ and $R_F$).\nThe feedback signal $I_f$ is fed to the gate terminal. Thus, the input port of the feedback network is the node corresponding to the gate.\n\nNow, we analyze the isolated feedback network. We apply a test current $I_o$ into the source node. We short-circuit the gate node to ground. We then find the current $I_f$ flowing from the source node through $R_F$ to the grounded gate node.\n\nAt the source node, the applied current $I_o$ splits and flows through two paths to ground:\n1.  Through resistor $R_S$ directly to ground.\n2.  Through resistor $R_F$ to the gate node, which is connected to ground.\n\nThe current flowing through the path with $R_F$ is the feedback current $I_f$. The two resistors $R_S$ and $R_F$ are in parallel with respect to the applied current $I_o$, as both provide a path from the source node to ground (one directly, one via the shorted input port).\n\nWe can find the feedback current $I_f$ using the current divider rule. The total current $I_o$ flowing into the source node is divided between the parallel branches containing $R_F$ and $R_S$. The current in the branch with $R_F$ is given by:\n$$\nI_f = I_o \\left( \\frac{\\text{resistance of the other branch}}{\\text{sum of branch resistances}} \\right)\n$$\nIn our case, the \"other branch\" has resistance $R_S$, and the sum of resistances is $R_F + R_S$.\n$$\nI_f = I_o \\left( \\frac{R_S}{R_F + R_S} \\right)\n$$\nBy definition, the feedback factor is $\\beta = I_f / I_o$.
