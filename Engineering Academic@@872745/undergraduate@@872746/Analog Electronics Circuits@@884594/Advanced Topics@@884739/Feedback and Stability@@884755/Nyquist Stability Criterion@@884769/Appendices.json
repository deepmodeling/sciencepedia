As defined in the main text, the number of unstable (right-half-plane) closed-loop poles $Z$ is given by the formula:\n$$\nZ = P - N\n$$\nwhere $P$ is the number of unstable open-loop poles and $N$ is the number of counter-clockwise (CCW) encirclements of the critical point $(-1, 0)$ by the Nyquist plot of the open-loop transfer function $L(s) = K G(s)$.\n\nThe plant $G(s)$ is given as open-loop stable, which means it has no poles in the right-half plane. Therefore, $P=0$. For the closed-loop system to be stable, we require $Z=0$. Substituting these values into the criterion gives $0 = 0 - N$, which simplifies to the condition $N=0$. The system is stable if and only if the Nyquist plot of $L(s)$ does not encircle the critical point $(-1, 0)$.\n\nThe plot of $L(s) = K G(s)$ is a scaled version of the plot of $G(s)$. An encirclement of $-1$ by the $L(s)$ plot is equivalent to an encirclement of the point $-1/K$ by the $G(s)$ plot. So, for stability, the plot of $G(s)$ must not encircle the point $-1/K$.\n\nThe description of the $G(j\\omega)$ plot—starting at $0.5$, crossing the negative real axis at $-2.5$, looping back to cross at $-0.8$, and returning to the origin—implies that the full Nyquist contour of $G(s)$ creates a clockwise loop that encloses the segment of the real axis between $-2.5$ and $-0.8$. A clockwise encirclement corresponds to $N=-1$ (one counter-clockwise encirclement in the negative sense).\n\nThe system will be unstable if the point $-1/K$ falls inside this enclosed segment, which would result in $N=-1$ and thus $Z = P - N = 0 - (-1) = 1$ unstable pole. The condition for instability is therefore:\n$$\n-2.5  -\\frac{1}{K}  -0.8\n$$\nMultiplying by $-1$ reverses the inequalities:\n$$\n0.8  \\frac{1}{K}  2.5\n$$\nSince $K$ is positive, we can take the reciprocal of all parts, which again reverses the inequalities:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{2.5}  K  \\frac{1}{0.8}\n$$\n$$\n0.4  K  1.25\n$$\nThis is the range of $K$ for which the system is unstable.
