This practice explores the direct and observable consequence of this design choice: a \"clipped\" output waveform where the peaks are flattened. Understanding why this occurs is crucial for correctly interpreting oscilloscope readings and analyzing the real-world behavior of your oscillator circuit [@problem_id:1309361].", "problem": "An electronics student is designing and building a Hartley oscillator for a radio frequency application. The circuit uses an inverting amplifier with a voltage gain of magnitude $A$ and a feedback network. The feedback network consists of a capacitor $C$ in parallel with two series-connected inductors, $L_1$ and $L_2$, where the connection point between the inductors is grounded. The output of the amplifier is connected to the end of inductor $L_1$, and the input to the amplifier is taken from the end of inductor $L_2$. The product of the amplifier's gain and the feedback network's transfer function at the oscillation frequency is known as the loop gain, denoted $A\\beta$.\n\nUpon powering the circuit, the student observes the output voltage on an oscilloscope. Instead of a pure sine wave, the output is a sine wave that is clearly \"clipped,\" meaning its positive and negative peaks are flattened as if limited. Assuming the circuit is oscillating at the intended frequency and the amplifier's phase shift is correct for oscillation, which of the following statements best explains this observation?\n\nA. The magnitude of the loop gain, $|A\\beta|$, is exactly 1.\n\nB. The magnitude of the loop gain, $|A\\beta|$, is significantly less than 1.\n\nC. The magnitude of the loop gain, $|A\\beta|$, is significantly greater than 1.\n\nD. The phase shift provided by the feedback network is exactly $0^\\circ$.", "solution": "To determine the cause of the clipped sine wave output, we must analyze the conditions for starting and sustaining oscillations in an electronic oscillator. The analysis relies on the Barkhausen criterion.\n\nThe Barkhausen criterion for sustained, stable oscillation states two conditions:\n1. The total phase shift around the feedback loop must be an integer multiple of $360^\\circ$ (or $0^\\circ$).\n2. The magnitude of the loop gain, $|A\\beta|$, must be exactly equal to 1 at the frequency of oscillation.\n\nIn a practical oscillator, for oscillations to begin, they must build up from the tiny, random electronic noise present in the circuit. For this small noise signal to be amplified and grow into a steady oscillation, the magnitude of the loop gain, $|A\\beta|$, must be slightly greater than 1. If $|A\\beta|$ were exactly 1, there would be no net gain to grow the amplitude. If $|A\\beta|$ were less than 1, any initial perturbation would decay, and oscillations would cease.\n\nTherefore, a practical oscillator is always designed with a small-signal loop gain $|A\\beta| > 1$.\n\nAs the oscillations start and the amplitude of the signal increases, the amplifier will eventually begin to exhibit non-linear behavior. Specifically, as the input signal to the amplifier becomes large, its output will be limited by the circuit's power supply rails. This phenomenon is called saturation or clipping.\n\nWhen the output waveform is visibly clipped, it is direct evidence that the signal amplitude has grown large enough to drive the amplifier into its saturation region during the peaks of the cycle. This strong saturation happens when the initial, small-signal loop gain $|A\\beta|$ is not just slightly greater than 1, but *significantly* greater than 1. A large loop gain causes the amplitude to grow rapidly and substantially, leading to hard limiting (clipping) at the power supply rails.\n\nThe oscillation amplitude stabilizes at the point where the non-linear clipping effect effectively reduces the *average* gain of the amplifier over one full cycle, such that the average value of the loop gain magnitude becomes exactly 1. However, the cause of this clipping is the initial condition where the small-signal gain is much larger than what is needed for ideal, linear oscillation.\n\nLet's analyze the given options:\nA. If $|A\\beta|$ were exactly 1, the circuit would sustain a perfect sine wave of a constant amplitude (assuming it was already oscillating). It would not, by itself, cause the amplitude to grow and clip. This represents the *average* condition in the clipped state, not the *cause* of the clipping.\nB. If $|A\\beta| < 1$, any oscillation would die out. No signal would be produced.\nC. If $|A\\beta|$ is significantly greater than 1, oscillations will start robustly and the amplitude will grow until it is limited by the amplifier's saturation. This results in a clipped sine wave. This matches the observation.\nD. A Hartley oscillator built with an inverting amplifier (which provides a $180^\\circ$ phase shift) requires the feedback network to provide an additional $180^\\circ$ phase shift to achieve a total loop phase of $360^\\circ$. A $0^\\circ$ phase shift from the feedback network would result in a total phase of $180^\\circ$, which corresponds to negative feedback and would suppress oscillations. Therefore, this option is incorrect.\n\nBased on this reasoning, the clipped output is a clear indication that the small-signal loop gain is significantly larger than unity.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1309361"}]}
