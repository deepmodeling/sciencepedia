The circuit is powered by a single DC voltage supply, $V_{CC}$, and has a resistor, $R_C$, connected between the supply and the transistor's collector terminal. The emitter is connected directly to the ground reference.\n\nIn this configuration, the possible DC operating points $(V_{CE}, I_C)$, where $V_{CE}$ is the collector-emitter voltage and $I_C$ is the collector current, are all located on a straight line on the $I_C$ vs. $V_{CE}$ plot. This line is known as the DC load line. The power dissipated by the transistor itself is given by the product $P_D = V_{CE} \\cdot I_C$.

Applying Kirchhoff's Voltage Law (KVL) to the collector-emitter loop of the circuit, we start at the supply voltage $V_{CC}$, go through the collector resistor $R_C$, and then across the transistor from collector to emitter. This gives the relationship:\n$$V_{CC} = I_C R_C + V_{CE}$$\nThis equation defines the DC load line. It represents the constraint on the possible values of $I_C$ and $V_{CE}$.\n\nThe power dissipated by the transistor, $P_D$, is the product of the voltage across it ($V_{CE}$) and the current through it ($I_C$):\n$$P_D = V_{CE} I_C$$\n\nOur goal is to maximize this function $P_D$ subject to the constraint of the load line equation. To do this, we can express $P_D$ as a function of a single variable, either $V_{CE}$ or $I_C$. Let's express it in terms of $V_{CE}$. From the load line equation, we can solve for $I_C$:\n$$I_C = \\frac{V_{CC} - V_{CE}}{R_C}$$\nNow, substitute this expression for $I_C$ into the power dissipation equation:\n$$P_D(V_{CE}) = V_{CE} \\left( \\frac{V_{CC} - V_{CE}}{R_C} \\right)$$\n$$P_D(V_{CE}) = \\frac{1}{R_C} (V_{CC}V_{CE} - V_{CE}^2)$$\nThis equation describes the transistor's power dissipation as a quadratic function of $V_{CE}$. The function is a downward-opening parabola (due to the $-V_{CE}^2$ term), which means it has a single maximum value.\n\nTo find the value of $V_{CE}$ that maximizes $P_D$, we take the derivative of $P_D(V_{CE})$ with respect to $V_{CE}$ and set it to zero:\n$$\\frac{dP_D}{dV_{CE}} = \\frac{d}{dV_{CE}} \\left[ \\frac{1}{R_C} (V_{CC}V_{CE} - V_{CE}^2) \\right]$$\n$$\\frac{dP_D}{dV_{CE}} = \\frac{1}{R_C} (V_{CC} - 2V_{CE})$$\nSetting the derivative to zero to find the extremum:\n$$\\frac{1}{R_C} (V_{CC} - 2V_{CE}) = 0$$\nSince $R_C \\neq 0$, this implies:\n$$V_{CC} - 2V_{CE} = 0$$\n$$V_{CE} = \\frac{V_{CC}}{2}$$\nThis is the collector-emitter voltage at which the power dissipation is maximum. This result is general for a resistive load line.\n\nNow we can find the maximum power, $P_{D,max}$. We can first find the corresponding current $I_C$ by substituting $V_{CE} = V_{CC}/2$ back into the load line equation:\n$$I_C = \\frac{V_{CC} - (V_{CC}/2)}{R_C} = \\frac{V_{CC}/2}{R_C} = \\frac{V_{CC}}{2R_C}$$\nThen, the maximum power is:\n$$P_{D,max} = V_{CE} \\cdot I_C = \\left(\\frac{V_{CC}}{2}\\right) \\left(\\frac{V_{CC}}{2R_C}\\right) = \\frac{V_{CC}^2}{4R_C}$$\n\nFinally, we substitute the given numerical values: $V_{CC} = 15.0\\,\\text{V}$ and $R_C = 250\\,\\Omega$.\n$$P_{D,max} = \\frac{(15.0\\,\\text{V})^2}{4 \\cdot (250\\,\\Omega)} = \\frac{225\\,\\text{V}^2}{1000\\,\\Omega}$$\n$$P_{D,max} = 0.225\\,\\text{W}$$\nThe value is already expressed to three significant figures, so no further rounding is needed.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.225}$$", "id": "1329590"}]}
