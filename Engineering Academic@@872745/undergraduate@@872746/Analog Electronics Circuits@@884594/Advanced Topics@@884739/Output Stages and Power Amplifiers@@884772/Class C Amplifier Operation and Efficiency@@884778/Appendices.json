The active device in such an amplifier is biased so that it conducts for significantly less than half of the input signal's cycle. This mode of operation causes the output current (e.g., collector or drain current) to flow in short, periodic pulses.\n\nTo recover a sinusoidal output voltage from these current pulses, a resonant tank circuit is employed as the load. This circuit functions as a high-quality band-pass filter, which is tuned to select the fundamental frequency component of the current pulses while rejecting all higher-order harmonics.\n\nConsider a Class C amplifier designed to operate with an input signal that results in output current pulses repeating at a fundamental frequency of $f_0 = 1.00$ MHz. The parallel resonant tank circuit consists of an inductor and a capacitor. A high-quality capacitor with a fixed capacitance of $C = 250$ pF is used in the tank.
