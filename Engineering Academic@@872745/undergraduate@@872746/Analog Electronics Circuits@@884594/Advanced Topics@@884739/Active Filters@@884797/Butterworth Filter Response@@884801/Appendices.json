The roll-off rate describes how quickly the filter attenuates signals as frequency increases.\n\nFirst, let's recall the magnitude of the frequency response, $|H(j\\omega)|$, for a general N-th order Butterworth low-pass filter. It is given by the formula:\n$$ |H(j\\omega)| = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 + \\left(\\frac{\\omega}{\\omega_c}\\right)^{2N}}} $$\nwhere $N$ is the order of the filter, $\\omega$ is the angular frequency of the input signal, and $\\omega_c$ is the cutoff frequency of the filter.\n\nThe gain in decibels, $G_{dB}$, is defined as $20 \\log_{10}(|H(j\\omega)|)$.
