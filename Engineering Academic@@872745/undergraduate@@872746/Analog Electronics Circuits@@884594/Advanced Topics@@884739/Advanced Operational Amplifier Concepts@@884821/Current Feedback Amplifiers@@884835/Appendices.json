The goal is to buffer and amplify the video signal before it is fed into an Analog-to-Digital Converter (ADC). Due to the high bandwidth requirements of the video signal, a Current-Feedback Amplifier (CFA) is selected for the design.\n\nThe CFA is configured as a non-inverting voltage amplifier. The feedback network is composed of a feedback resistor, $R_f$, connected from the output to the inverting input, and a gain-setting resistor, $R_g$, connected from the inverting input to ground.

We will use the ideal model of the CFA as described in the problem statement.\n\nFirst, let's establish the relationships based on the ideal CFA model in a non-inverting configuration.\n1. The input signal $v_{in}$ is applied to the high-impedance non-inverting input terminal (+). Thus, the voltage at this terminal is $v_{+} = v_{in}$.\n2. The internal unity-gain buffer of the CFA ensures that the voltage at the inverting input terminal (-) tracks the voltage at the non-inverting terminal. Therefore, $v_{-} = v_{+} = v_{in}$.\n3. The inverting input is the output of this buffer and acts as a low-impedance node. The current, let's call it $i_{-}$, which flows from this node into the main amplifier's transimpedance stage, determines the output voltage.\n4. The relationship between this current and the output voltage is given by the open-loop transimpedance gain, $Z_T$. That is, $v_{out} = Z_T i_{-}$. In the ideal case, $Z_T \\to \\infty$. This implies that for any finite output voltage, the error current $i_{-}$ must be zero.\n\nNow, we apply Kirchhoff's Current Law (KCL) at the inverting input node, $v_{-}$. The sum of currents leaving the node must be zero.\nThe current flowing from the node toward the output terminal through the feedback resistor $R_f$ is $\\frac{v_{-} - v_{out}}{R_f}$.\nThe current flowing from the node toward ground through the gain-setting resistor $R_g$ is $\\frac{v_{-} - 0}{R_g}$.\nSince $i_{-} = 0$ in the ideal case, the KCL equation is:\n$$\n\\frac{v_{-} - v_{out}}{R_f} + \\frac{v_{-}}{R_g} = 0\n$$\nNow, substitute the ideal buffer condition, $v_{-} = v_{in}$:\n$$\n\\frac{v_{in} - v_{out}}{R_f} + \\frac{v_{in}}{R_g} = 0\n$$\nOur goal is to find the closed-loop gain $A_v = v_{out} / v_{in}$.
