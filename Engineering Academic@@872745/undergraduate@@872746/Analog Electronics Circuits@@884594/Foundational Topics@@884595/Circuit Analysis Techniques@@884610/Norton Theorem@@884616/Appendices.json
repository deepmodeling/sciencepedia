We need to find the values of these two parameters for the circuit as viewed from terminals A and B.\n\n**Step 1: Find the Norton Current ($I_N$)**\n\nThe Norton current $I_N$ is the current that flows from terminal A to terminal B when these two terminals are connected by an ideal short circuit. When terminals A and B are shorted, the resistor $R_1$ is bypassed, as both of its ends are at the same potential.\n\nThe circuit then simplifies to the voltage source $V_s$ connected in series with only the resistor $R_2$. The current flowing out of the positive terminal of the source, through the short from A to B, and then through $R_2$ back to the negative terminal is determined by Ohm's Law.\n\nThe total resistance in this simplified loop is just $R_2$.
