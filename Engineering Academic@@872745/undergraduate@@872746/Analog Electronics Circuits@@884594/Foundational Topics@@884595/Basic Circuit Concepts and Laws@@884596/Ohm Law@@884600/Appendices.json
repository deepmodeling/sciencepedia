This practice problem models a common scenario in electronic devices where multiple modules share a single power source.

The total current drawn from the battery by both modules operating simultaneously is measured to be $I_{total}$. Determine the analytical expression for the current, $I_{B}$, that flows through Module B. Your answer should be expressed in terms of the given parameters $V$, $R_{A}$, and $I_{total}$.", "solution": "The problem describes a simple parallel circuit. We can solve for the current through Module B, $I_B$, by applying Ohm's Law and Kirchhoff's Current Law.\n\nFirst, we identify the key characteristics of a parallel circuit. The voltage across each component connected in parallel is the same and is equal to the source voltage. Therefore, the voltage across Module A, $V_A$, and the voltage across Module B, $V_B$, are both equal to the battery voltage $V$.\n$$V_A = V_B = V$$\n\nNext, we can use Ohm's Law, which states that the current flowing through a resistor is equal to the voltage across it divided by its resistance ($I = V/R$). We can apply this law to Module A, for which we know both the voltage $V$ and the resistance $R_A$. The current through Module A, which we denote as $I_A$, is given by:\n$$I_A = \\frac{V_A}{R_A} = \\frac{V}{R_A}$$\n\nNow, we apply Kirchhoff's Current Law (KCL) to the circuit. KCL states that the sum of currents entering a node (or junction) must equal the sum of currents leaving that node. In this circuit, the total current $I_{total}$ from the battery enters the junction where the two modules are connected, and it splits into the currents $I_A$ and $I_B$. Therefore, we can write:\n$$I_{total} = I_A + I_B$$\n\nOur goal is to find an expression for $I_B$. We can rearrange the KCL equation to solve for $I_B$:\n$$I_B = I_{total} - I_A$$\n\nFinally, we substitute the expression for $I_A$ that we found using Ohm's Law into the rearranged KCL equation. This will give us the final expression for $I_B$ in terms of the given parameters $V$, $R_A$, and $I_{total}$.\n$$I_B = I_{total} - \\frac{V}{R_A}$$\nThis expression represents the current flowing through Module B.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{I_{total} - \\frac{V}{R_{A}}}$$", "id": "1321900"}, {"introduction": "This final practice elevates our analysis to a more complex and widely used circuit: the Wheatstone bridge.
