This exercise challenges you to think about the fundamental definition of a current source—an element that supplies a constant current regardless of the voltage across its terminals. By considering how the voltage responds as the load resistance changes, you can solidify your understanding of the crucial difference between an ideal current source and an ideal voltage source [@problem_id:1310429].", "problem": "An electronics engineering student is characterizing a two-terminal device that is designed to function as an ideal current source. This ideal source is specified to supply a constant, non-zero direct current, $I_0$, regardless of the circuit connected to it. For the test, the student connects the ideal current source to a variable load resistor, whose resistance can be adjusted and is denoted by $R_L$. The student measures the voltage, $V_S$, that develops across the terminals of the current source as they sweep the resistance $R_L$ from a value infinitesimally greater than zero up to a very large, near-infinite value.\n\nWhich of the following statements best describes the behavior of the voltage $V_S$ across the ideal current source as the load resistance $R_L$ is increased from near-zero to a very large value?\n\nA. The voltage $V_S$ starts near zero and increases proportionally with the resistance $R_L$.\n\nB. The voltage $V_S$ remains constant at a non-zero value regardless of the resistance $R_L$.\n\nC. The voltage $V_S$ starts at a very large value and decreases as the resistance $R_L$ increases.\n\nD. The voltage $V_S$ is always zero because an ideal current source has zero internal resistance.\n\nE. The voltage $V_S$ is initially non-zero and increases, but it approaches a finite maximum value as the resistance $R_L$ becomes very large.", "solution": "Let the ideal current source supply a constant direct current of magnitude $I_0$, independent of the voltage across it. The load resistor with resistance $R_L$ is connected directly across the source’s terminals, so the voltage across the source equals the voltage across the resistor:\n$$V_S = V_R$$\nBy Kirchhoff’s current law applied at the node pair connecting only the source and the resistor, the current through the resistor must equal the source current (there is no other branch):\n$$I_R = I_0$$\nApplying Ohm’s law to the resistor gives\n$$V_R = I_R R_L = I_0 R_L$$\nTherefore,\n$$V_S = I_0 R_L$$\nAs $R_L \\to 0^+$, $V_S \\to 0$. As $R_L$ increases, $V_S$ increases proportionally with slope $I_0$. As $R_L \\to \\infty$, $V_S \\to \\infty$, i.e., there is no finite maximum voltage for an ideal current source. Hence the correct qualitative description is that $V_S$ starts near zero and increases proportionally with $R_L$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1310429"}, {"introduction": "Ideal voltage sources are the cornerstone of many circuits, providing a constant potential difference.
