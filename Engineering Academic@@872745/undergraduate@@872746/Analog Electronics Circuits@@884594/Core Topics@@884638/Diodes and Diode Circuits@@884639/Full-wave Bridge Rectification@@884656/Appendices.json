[@problem_id:1306380]", "problem": "An electronics technician is building a power supply using a full-wave bridge rectifier. The circuit consists of a transformer, a diode bridge, and a load resistor. The transformer has a primary winding connected to a standard Alternating Current (AC) mains supply and a secondary winding that is center-tapped. The secondary winding has output terminals labeled A and B, and a center-tap terminal labeled CT.\n\nThe diode bridge consists of four ideal diodes: D1, D2, D3, and D4. The AC inputs of the bridge are connected to terminals A and B of the transformer. The positive DC output of the bridge is taken from the junction of the D1 and D2 cathodes, and the negative DC output is taken from the junction of the D3 and D4 anodes. A load resistor, $R_L$, is connected across these positive and negative DC output terminals.\n\nDuring assembly, a wiring error is made. The technician correctly connects the center-tap CT of the transformer to the circuit's earth ground. However, they also connect the negative DC output terminal of the bridge rectifier to the same earth ground point. Assume the transformer and diodes are ideal components (zero winding resistance, zero diode forward resistance, infinite reverse resistance, and a forward voltage drop of $V_f$).\n\nWhich of the following statements most accurately describes the operational behavior and consequences of this specific wiring configuration?\n\nA. The circuit will function as a normal full-wave bridge rectifier, producing a DC voltage across the load, but the peak output voltage will be halved compared to a non-center-tapped transformer with the same total secondary voltage.\n\nB. The circuit will behave as a standard center-tapped full-wave rectifier, utilizing diodes D1 and D2 on alternate half-cycles, while diodes D3 and D4 remain reverse-biased and play no role in the circuit's operation.\n\nC. The circuit will act as a half-wave rectifier, where the load receives power only during the positive half-cycles of the secondary voltage, and catastrophic failure is unlikely.\n\nD. During each AC half-cycle, one half of the transformer's secondary winding will be short-circuited through one of the lower diodes (D3 or D4), leading to a hazardous overcurrent condition likely to destroy the diode and/or the transformer.\n\nE. The load resistor $R_L$ is effectively bypassed, causing the output voltage to be zero, but no damage will occur to the transformer or the diodes as no current can flow.", "solution": "Define node voltages with the center-tap as the reference ground: set $V_{\\mathrm{CT}}=0$. Let the transformer half-secondary instantaneous emf be $v_{s}(t)$, so the end-terminal voltages relative to the center tap are\n$$\nV_{A}=v_{s}(t), \\qquad V_{B}=-v_{s}(t).\n$$\nThe bridge is oriented so that $D_{1},D_{2}$ have their cathodes at the positive DC node $V_{+}$ and anodes at $A$ and $B$, respectively; $D_{3},D_{4}$ have their anodes at the negative DC node $V_{-}$ and cathodes at $A$ and $B$, respectively. By the miswiring, $V_{-}$ is tied to earth and $V_{\\mathrm{CT}}$ is also tied to earth, hence\n$$\nV_{-}=V_{\\mathrm{CT}}=0.\n$$\nIdeal diode conduction criteria with a constant forward drop $V_{f}$ are:\n- A diode conducts if its anode-to-cathode voltage satisfies $V_{\\text{anode}}-V_{\\text{cathode}}\\geq V_{f}$.\n- It is off if $V_{\\text{anode}}-V_{\\text{cathode}}V_{f}$.\n\nAnalyze each half-cycle.\n\nCase 1: $v_{s}(t)0$ (terminal $A$ positive, $B$ negative). Then\n$$\nV_{A}=v_{s}0, \\qquad V_{B}=-v_{s}0.\n$$\nLower diodes:\n- $D_{3}$ has anode at $V_{-}=0$ and cathode at $V_{A}=v_{s}0$, so $0-v_{s}0V_{f}$; $D_{3}$ is reverse-biased (off).\n- $D_{4}$ has anode at $0$ and cathode at $-v_{s}0$, so $0-(-v_{s})=v_{s}$.

Therefore, during this half-cycle, one half of the secondary is effectively shorted through $D_{4}$, creating a hazardous overcurrent.\n\nSimultaneously, the upper diode $D_{1}$ has anode at $V_{A}=v_{s}$ and cathode at $V_{+}$; it would conduct to supply the load if $v_{s}-V_{+}\\geq V_{f}$. However, the dominant effect is the short-circuit path just identified, which overwhelms normal operation and leads to destructive current.\n\nCase 2: $v_{s}(t)0$ (terminal $B$ positive, $A$ negative). Then\n$$\nV_{A}=v_{s}0, \\qquad V_{B}=-v_{s}0.\n$$\nLower diodes:\n- $D_{4}$ has anode at $0$ and cathode at $V_{B}0$, so $0-V_{B}0$; $D_{4}$ is reverse-biased (off).\n- $D_{3}$ has anode at $0$ and cathode at $V_{A}0$, so $0- V_{A}=-v_{s}0$. For any $-v_{s}\\geq V_{f}$, $D_{3}$ is forward-biased (on).\n\nWith $D_{3}$ on, node $A$ is clamped by $0 - V_{A}=V_{f}\\Rightarrow V_{A}=-V_{f}$, conflicting with the transformer's imposed $V_{A}=v_{s}$. The loop around the upper half-winding and $D_{3}$ is\n$$\n\\text{CT}\\to D_{3}\\to A \\to \\text{upper half-winding} \\to \\text{CT},\n$$\nfor which KVL requires\n$$\nv_{s} + V_{f} + 0 = 0 \\;\\Rightarrow\\; v_{s}=-V_{f},\n$$\nwhich again cannot be satisfied for a general sinusoid with zero series impedance. The result is, analogously, a short-circuit of the upper half of the secondary through $D_{3}$ with hazardous overcurrent.\n\nConclusion. In each AC half-cycle, one of the lower diodes ($D_{4}$ when $v_{s}0$, $D_{3}$ when $v_{s}0$) forward-biases and, together with the corresponding half of the transformer secondary, forms a near-zero-impedance loop. Under the ideal assumptions (zero winding resistance and zero diode forward resistance except the fixed drop $V_{f}$), the current demanded by KVL is unbounded whenever $|v_{s}| \\neq V_{f}$, indicating a short-circuit condition that will lead to destructive overcurrent in real hardware. This exactly matches statement D; the other options either predict normal operation, half-wave behavior, or no-damage conditions, none of which are consistent with the diode biasing and KVL analysis above.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "1306380"}]}
