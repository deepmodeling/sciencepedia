Before we can estimate specific parameters, we need to select an appropriate model family.

Both systems are initially at rest. To probe their behavior, the engineer applies a unit step input, $u(t) = 1$ for $t \\ge 0$, to each system and records the output response, $y(t)$.\n\nFor System A, the recorded data shows that at the moment the step input is applied ($t=0$), the output immediately begins to change, exhibiting a distinct, non-zero rate of change.\n\nFor System B, the data shows that at $t=0$, the output's rate of change is precisely zero. The response is \"flat\" at the very beginning before it starts to curve upwards.\n\nThe engineer intends to model these systems using the simplest possible structures that are consistent with these observations. The candidate models are a standard first-order model, $G_1(s) = \\frac{K_1}{\\tau s + 1}$, and a strictly proper second-order model, $G_2(s) = \\frac{K_2 \\omega_n^2}{s^2 + 2\\zeta\\omega_n s + \\omega_n^2}$, where all parameters ($K_1, \\tau, K_2, \\omega_n, \\zeta$) are positive real constants.\n\nBased on these initial observations of the step responses, which of the following conclusions is the most appropriate?\n\nA.

It is impossible to distinguish between these models based only on the initial slope of the step response.", "solution": "We analyze the initial behavior of the step responses using Laplace-domain tools. For an LTI system with transfer function $G(s)$ and a unit step input $u(t)=1$ for $t \\ge 0$, the Laplace transform of the input is $U(s)=\\frac{1}{s}$. The output in the Laplace domain is\n$$\nY(s)=G(s)U(s)=\\frac{G(s)}{s}.\n$$\nThe initial value theorem gives\n$$\ny(0^{+})=\\lim_{s \\to \\infty} s Y(s)=\\lim_{s \\to \\infty} G(s).\n$$\nFor strictly proper systems, $\\lim_{s \\to \\infty} G(s)=0$, so $y(0^{+})=0$.

Using the initial value theorem for derivatives,\n$$\ny'(0^{+})=\\lim_{s \\to \\infty} s\\left[sY(s)-y(0^{+})\\right].\n$$\nSince $y(0^{+})=0$, this reduces to\n$$\ny'(0^{+})=\\lim_{s \\to \\infty} s^{2} Y(s)=\\lim_{s \\to \\infty} s G(s).\n$$\n\nEvaluate for the first-order model:\n$$\ns G_{1}(s)=\\frac{s K_{1}}{\\tau s+1} \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad \\lim_{s \\to \\infty} s G_{1}(s)=\\frac{K_{1}}{\\tau},\n$$\nwhich is positive and finite because $K_{1}0$ and $\\tau0$. Thus a first-order system exhibits a nonzero initial slope for a unit step input.\n\nEvaluate for the strictly proper second-order model:\n$$\ns G_{2}(s)=\\frac{s K_{2}\\omega_{n}^{2}}{s^{2}+2\\zeta \\omega_{n} s+\\omega_{n}^{2}} \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad \\lim_{s \\to \\infty} s G_{2}(s)=\\lim_{s \\to \\infty} \\frac{K_{2}\\omega_{n}^{2}}{s}=0,\n$$\nso a strictly proper second-order system has zero initial slope for a unit step input, regardless of $\\zeta$.\n\nTherefore, the observation that System A has a distinct nonzero initial rate of change is consistent with a first-order system, while System B’s zero initial slope is consistent with a strictly proper second-order system.
