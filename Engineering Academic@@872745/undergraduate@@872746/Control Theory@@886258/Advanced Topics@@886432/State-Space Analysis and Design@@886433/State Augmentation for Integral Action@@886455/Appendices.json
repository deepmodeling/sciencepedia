This exercise is crucial for developing an intuition for how each component, from mass and damping to the integral gain $k_{I}$, shapes the overall system behavior.", "problem": "An automotive engineer is designing an active suspension system for one corner of a vehicle. The system's vertical dynamics are modeled as a mass $m$ (representing a quarter of the vehicle's chassis mass) supported by a spring of stiffness $k$ and a damper with coefficient $c$. An actuator provides a control force $u(t)$ to adjust the suspension. The vertical displacement of the mass from its desired equilibrium height is denoted by $y(t)$. The governing equation of motion for this system is given by:\n$$m\\frac{d^{2}y}{dt^{2}} + c\\frac{dy}{dt} + ky = u(t)$$\nTo ensure that the vehicle maintains its design ride height and eliminates any steady-state error caused by constant disturbances (such as changes in passenger load), the engineer implements a controller with integral action. This is achieved by augmenting the system's state (position $y(t)$ and velocity $\\dot{y}(t)$) with an integral state variable, $x_I(t)$, defined as the time integral of the position, $x_I(t) = \\int y(t) \\,dt$.\n\nThe control force is then generated by a full state-feedback law based on this augmented state:\n$$u(t) = -k_{1}y(t) - k_{2}\\frac{dy}{dt}(t) - k_{I}x_{I}(t)$$\nwhere $k_{1}$, $k_{2}$, and $k_{I}$ are the constant feedback gains for the proportional, derivative, and integral terms, respectively.\n\nFind the characteristic polynomial of the resulting closed-loop control system.
