The temperature of the instrument, $T(t)$, evolves according to the first-order differential equation:\n$$\n\\frac{dT(t)}{dt} = -\\alpha (T(t) - T_{amb}) + \\gamma U(t)\n$$\nwhere $T_{amb}$ is the constant ambient temperature of the spacecraft's interior. The positive constant $\\alpha$ is the heat transfer coefficient, representing how quickly the instrument loses heat to its surroundings. The positive constant $\\gamma$ is the heating gain, which relates the control input $U(t)$ (power supplied to a resistive heater) to the rate of temperature change.\n\nTo maintain the instrument at a desired setpoint temperature $T_{sp}$, a proportional controller is used. The control law for the heater power is:\n$$\nU(t) = k (T_{sp} - T(t))\n$$\nwhere $k$ is the proportional feedback gain to be determined.\n\nFor analysis, it is convenient to define a state variable $x(t) = T(t) - T_{amb}$, which represents the temperature deviation from the ambient.
