This scenario, as modeled in this problem, represents a system where the state variables are decoupled—meaning they evolve independently of one another. Calculating the state transition matrix $\\Phi(t) = \\exp(At)$ for such a system is remarkably simple, as it involves exponentiating each diagonal element individually. This exercise provides a clear and intuitive foundation, directly linking the system's eigenvalues (the diagonal entries of $A$) to the exponential modes of the system's response [@problem_id:1619032].", "problem": "Consider a simplified model of two independent, uncoupled thermal systems.
