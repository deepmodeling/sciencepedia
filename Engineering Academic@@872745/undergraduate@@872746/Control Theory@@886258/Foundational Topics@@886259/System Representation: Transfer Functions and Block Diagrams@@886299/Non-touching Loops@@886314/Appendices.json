The system has a main signal path that proceeds sequentially through nodes $n_1, n_2, n_3,$ and $n_4$. In addition to this forward path, the system contains three feedback loops, whose gains are given by transfer functions in the Laplace domain. The loops are defined by the paths they trace through the system's nodes:\n\n- **Loop 1:** A local feedback loop that starts at node $n_1$ and returns to node $n_1$. Its gain is $L_1(s) = G_1(s) H_1(s)$.\n- **Loop 2:** A feedback loop that starts at node $n_2$, passes through node $n_1$, and returns to node $n_2$. Its gain is $L_2(s) = G_2(s) H_2(s)$.\n- **Loop 3:** A feedback loop that starts at node $n_3$, passes through node $n_2$, and returns to node $n_3$. Its gain is $L_3(s) = G_3(s) H_3(s)$.\n\nThe denominator of the system's overall transfer function, $\\Delta(s)$, is determined by the system's loops.

Two loops are defined as non-touching if they do not share any common nodes.\n\nBased on the provided description of the loops and the nodes they involve, determine the expression for the term $\\sum L_i L_j$.
