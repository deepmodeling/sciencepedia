The superposition principle is composed of two fundamental properties: additivity and homogeneity.\n- **Additivity**: If an input $x_1(t)$ produces an output $y_1(t)$ and an input $x_2(t)$ produces an output $y_2(t)$, then the input $x_1(t) + x_2(t)$ must produce the output $y_1(t) + y_2(t)$.\n- **Homogeneity (or Scaling)**: If an input $x(t)$ produces an output $y(t)$, then for any real scalar constant $\\alpha$, the input $\\alpha x(t)$ must produce the output $\\alpha y(t)$.\n\nConsider a common type of sensor system whose output signal $y(t)$ is related to its input physical measurement $x(t)$ by the following equation:\n$$y(t) = m x(t) + b$$\nwhere $m$ and $b$ are non-zero real constants.

The fundamental idea is that the total expansion of an object subjected to a non-uniform temperature field can be found by integrating the expansion of its infinitesimal parts.\n\nFirst, let's analyze Scenario A. The rod of initial length $L_0$ is heated uniformly by a temperature difference $\\Delta T$. The total elongation, $\\Delta L_A$, is given by the standard formula for linear thermal expansion:\n$$ \\Delta L_A = \\alpha L_0 \\Delta T $$\nwhere $\\alpha$ is the coefficient of linear thermal expansion of the material. This equation serves as our reference, relating the measured quantity $\\Delta L_A$ to the physical parameters of the system. We can rearrange it to express the product of the physical constants as:\n$$ \\alpha \\Delta T = \\frac{\\Delta L_A}{L_0} $$\n\nNext, we analyze Scenario B. The temperature is not uniform but varies with position $x$ along the rod. The temperature at any point $x$ is given by $T(x) = T_0 + 2\\Delta T \\left(\\frac{x}{L_0}\\right)^2$.

The elongation of this small segment, which we can call $d(\\Delta L_B)$, is governed by the same principle of linear expansion. The initial length of this segment is $dx$, and it experiences a local temperature change of $\\Delta T(x)$. Thus, its expansion is:\n$$ d(\\Delta L_B) = \\alpha \\cdot (\\text{length}) \\cdot (\\text{temperature change}) = \\alpha \\cdot (dx) \\cdot \\Delta T(x) $$\nSubstituting the expression for $\\Delta T(x)$:\n$$ d(\\Delta L_B) = \\alpha \\left( 2\\Delta T \\left(\\frac{x}{L_0}\\right)^2 \\right) dx $$\n\nTo find the total elongation $\\Delta L_B$ of the entire rod, we must sum (integrate) the elongations of all such infinitesimal segments from one end of the rod ($x=0$) to the other ($x=L_0$):\n$$ \\Delta L_B = \\int_0^{L_0} d(\\Delta L_B) = \\int_0^{L_0} \\alpha \\cdot 2\\Delta T \\left(\\frac{x}{L_0}\\right)^2 dx $$\nSince $\\alpha$, $\\Delta T$, and $L_0$ are constants with respect to the integration variable $x$, we can pull them out of the integral:\n$$ \\Delta L_B = \\frac{2 \\alpha \\Delta T}{L_0^2} \\int_0^{L_0} x^2 dx $$\nNow, we evaluate the definite integral:\n$$ \\int_0^{L_0} x^2 dx = \\left[ \\frac{x^3}{3} \\right]_0^{L_0} = \\frac{L_0^3}{3} - 0 = \\frac{L_0^3}{3} $$\nSubstituting this result back into the expression for $\\Delta L_B$:\n$$ \\Delta L_B = \\frac{2 \\alpha \\Delta T}{L_0^2} \\left( \\frac{L_0^3}{3} \\right) = \\frac{2}{3} \\alpha \\Delta T L_0 $$\nThe problem asks for the answer to be expressed in terms of $\\Delta L_A$.
