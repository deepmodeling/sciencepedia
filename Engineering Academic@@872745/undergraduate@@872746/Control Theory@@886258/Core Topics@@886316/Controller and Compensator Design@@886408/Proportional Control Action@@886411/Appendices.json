The controller manipulates a steam valve, which represents the Controller Output (CO). The CO can range from 0% (fully closed) to 100% (fully open). The temperature measurement is the Process Variable (PV), which is monitored over a specific calibrated range.\n\nA key tuning parameter for this type of controller is the Proportional Band (PB). The PB is defined as the percentage of the PV's measurement range over which a 100% change in the CO will occur. For this particular reactor, the control engineer has set the PB to 40%.\n\nThe proportional gain, $K_p$, is the dimensionless parameter used in the controller's fundamental algorithm, which relates the change in controller output to the error (the difference between the setpoint and the PV). The standard relationship between the dimensionless proportional gain $K_p$ and the Proportional Band (expressed in percent, PB%) is given by the formula $K_p = \\frac{100\\%}{\\text{PB}\\%}$.\n\nCalculate the dimensionless proportional gain $K_p$ that corresponds to the specified Proportional Band setting of 40%.", "solution": "The proportional-only controller uses the standard relationship between proportional gain and proportional band: when PB is expressed as a fraction of the PV range (i.e., as a unitless decimal), the gain is the reciprocal of PB. This follows from the given percentage-based formula by converting to fractional form.\n\nLet the fractional proportional band be denoted by $PB_{f}$, defined as the percentage PB divided by 100, so it is a unitless fraction of full scale. The given PB is forty percent, thus\n$$\nPB_{f} = 0.40 = \\frac{2}{5}.\n$$\nUsing the standard relation in fractional form,\n$$\nK_{p} = \\frac{1}{PB_{f}}.\n$$\nSubstitute $PB_{f} = \\frac{2}{5}$:\n$$\nK_{p} = \\frac{1}{\\frac{2}{5}} = \\frac{5}{2} = 2.5.\n$$\nTherefore, the dimensionless proportional gain corresponding to a proportional band of forty percent is $K_{p} = 2.5$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{2.5}$$", "id": "1602483"}, {"introduction": "A core skill for a control engineer is to deduce system properties from experimental observations.
