This first exercise focuses on using the Distributive Theorem to expand a compact Product-of-Sums (POS) expression into its equivalent Sum-of-Products (SOP) form. Mastering this mechanical conversion is essential, as the SOP form is a prerequisite for many design and analysis techniques, including Karnaugh map simplification and programmable logic array implementation [@problem_id:1930221].", "problem": "In digital logic design, Boolean expressions are often manipulated to achieve a standard form, which simplifies analysis and implementation. One such standard form is the Sum-of-Products (SOP) form. An expression is in SOP form if it is a sum (OR operations) of one or more product terms (AND operations of literals). For instance, $XY' + YZ$ is an SOP expression.\n\nConsider a Boolean function $F$ that depends on five input variables: $A$, $B$, $C$, $D$, and $E$. The function is initially represented by the following compact expression:\n\n$$F = (X + Y')(Z + W'V)$$\n\nwhere $X$, $Y$, $Z$, $W$, and $V$ are placeholders for the five input variables in alphabetical order, i.e., $X=A$, $Y=B$, $Z=C$, $W=D$, and $V=E$. In this notation, the plus symbol ($+$) denotes the logical OR operation, concatenation of variables (e.g., $W'V$) denotes the logical AND operation, and the prime symbol (e.g., $Y'$) denotes the logical NOT (complement) operation.\n\nConvert the given expression for $F$ into its equivalent standard Sum-of-Products (SOP) form.", "solution": "We are given the Boolean function in placeholder form:\n$$F = (X + Y')(Z + W'V),$$\nwith the mapping $X=A$, $Y=B$, $Z=C$, $W=D$, and $V=E$.

This exercise challenges you to use the Distributive Theorem in reverse by factoring out common terms from a Sum-of-Products expression, a technique directly analogous to factoring in conventional algebra.
