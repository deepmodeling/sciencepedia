The alarm, denoted by the function $F$, is activated ($F=1$) based on the state of four sensors that measure different physical parameters. A high reading from a sensor corresponds to a logic value of 1, and a low reading corresponds to a logic value of 0.\n\nThe sensors are:\n-   `X`: Pressure sensor\n-   `Y`: Temperature sensor\n-   `Z`: pH level sensor\n-   `W`: Coolant flow rate sensor\n\nThe initial design specification for the alarm logic is given by the Boolean expression in sum-of-products form:\n$$F(X, Y, Z, W) = X'Y + XZ + YZ + Y'W + ZW$$\nHere, a primed variable like $X'$ represents the logical NOT of $X$.\n\nFor a more cost-effective and efficient hardware implementation, you are tasked with simplifying this logic to its minimal sum-of-products form using Boolean algebra.

The term $ZW$ is also redundant because it is covered by the remaining terms. We can prove this algebraically. A term is covered if every case where it is true is also a case where another part of the expression is true.\nLet's analyze the term $ZW$ by expanding it with the variable $Y$:\n$$ZW = ZW(Y + Y') = YZW + Y'ZW$$\nNow we can see if each of these new parts is covered by other terms in the expression $F = X'Y + XZ + Y'W$:\n1.  Consider the part $Y'ZW$. The term $Y'W$ is present in the expression. By the absorption law ($A + AB = A$), we have $Y'W + Y'ZW = Y'W(1+Z) = Y'W$. This means the $Y'ZW$ part is completely covered by the $Y'W$ term.\n2.  Consider the part $YZW$. This part is covered by the combination of $X'Y$ and $XZ$. The consensus of $X'Y$ and $XZ$ is $YZ$. This implies that the function $X'Y + XZ$ logically covers $YZ$. Since $YZW$ is a subset of $YZ$ (i.e., if $YZW=1$, then $YZ=1$), it is also covered by $X'Y + XZ$.\n\nSince both components of $ZW$ (namely $Y'ZW$ and $YZW$) are already covered by other terms in the expression, the entire term $ZW$ is redundant and can be removed.\n\nThis leaves us with the minimal sum-of-products form:\n$$F = X'Y + XZ + Y'W$$\nNo further simplifications are possible among these terms.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{X'Y+XZ+Y'W}$$", "id": "1924591"}]}
