It has two data inputs, $I_0$ and $I_1$, a single select line $S$, and one output $F$. The entire circuit is constructed exclusively from 2-input NOR gates. The circuit's structure is defined by the following connections:\n\n1.  An inverter for the select line $S$ is implemented using a NOR gate with its inputs tied together, producing the signal $S_{inv}$.\n2.  A NOR gate takes $S$ and $I_0$ as inputs to produce an intermediate signal $A$.\n3.  A second NOR gate takes $S_{inv}$ and $I_1$ as inputs to produce an intermediate signal $B$.\n4.  A final NOR gate takes $A$ and $B$ as inputs to produce the final output $F$.\n\nAnalyze this specific NOR-gate implementation for static hazards. A static hazard is a condition where a single input variable changes, and the output, which should remain at a constant logic level, momentarily transitions to the opposite level before settling back.

The circuit is free from all static hazards for any transition of the select line $S$.", "solution": "The primary task is to determine if the specified NOR-gate circuit exhibits any static hazards when the select line $S$ changes its state. To do this, we must first derive the Boolean expression for the output $F$ and then analyze it under the conditions relevant to static hazards.\n\n**Step 1: Derive the Boolean expression for the output F.**\n\nThe circuit is described in four parts. Let's translate each part into a Boolean expression.\n\n1.  The inverter for the select line $S$ produces $S_{inv}$. A NOR gate with tied inputs acts as a NOT gate.\n    $$S_{inv} = \\overline{S+S} = \\overline{S}$$\n\n2.  The intermediate signal $A$ is the NOR of $S$ and $I_0$.\n    $$A = \\overline{S+I_0}$$\n\n3.  The intermediate signal $B$ is the NOR of $S_{inv}$ and $I_1$. Substituting the expression for $S_{inv}$:\n    $$B = \\overline{S_{inv}+I_1} = \\overline{\\overline{S}+I_1}$$\n\n4.  The final output $F$ is the NOR of $A$ and $B$.\n    $$F = \\overline{A+B}$$\n\nNow, substitute the expressions for $A$ and $B$ into the expression for $F$:\n$$F = \\overline{(\\overline{S+I_0}) + (\\overline{\\overline{S}+I_1})}$$\n\nTo simplify this expression, we apply De Morgan's Law ($\\overline{X+Y} = \\overline{X} \\cdot \\overline{Y}$):\n$$F = \\overline{(\\overline{S+I_0})} \\cdot \\overline{(\\overline{\\overline{S}+I_1})}$$\n\nApplying the law of double negation ($\\overline{\\overline{X}} = X$):\n$$F = (S+I_0) \\cdot (\\overline{S}+I_1)$$\n\nThis is the simplified Product-of-Sums (POS) expression for the circuit's output. This function represents a 2-to-1 multiplexer, as can be verified:\n- If $S=0$, $F = (0+I_0)(\\overline{0}+I_1) = (I_0)(1+I_1) = I_0 \\cdot 1 = I_0$.\n- If $S=1$, $F = (1+I_0)(\\overline{1}+I_1) = (1)(0+I_1) = 1 \\cdot I_1 = I_1$.\nThe circuit correctly selects $I_0$ when $S=0$ and $I_1$ when $S=1$.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze for a static-1 hazard.**\n\nA static-1 hazard occurs if the output is supposed to remain at logic 1 during a transition of $S$ but momentarily glitches to 0. For the output $F$ to be intended to be 1 for both $S=0$ and $S=1$, the data inputs must be set accordingly.\n- When $S=0$, we need $F=I_0=1$.\n- When $S=1$, we need $F=I_1=1$.\nThus, we must test for a static-1 hazard under the condition $I_0=1$ and $I_1=1$.\n\nLet's substitute these input values into our derived expression:\n$$F = (S+1) \\cdot (\\overline{S}+1)$$\nUsing the Boolean identity $X+1=1$:\n$$F = (1) \\cdot (1) = 1$$\nUnder these conditions ($I_0=1, I_1=1$), the output $F$ simplifies to a constant 1. The expression is independent of $S$. Therefore, no transition of $S$ can cause the output to change, and the circuit has no static-1 hazard. This eliminates options A and C.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze for a static-0 hazard.**\n\nA static-0 hazard occurs if the output is supposed to remain at logic 0 during a transition of $S$ but momentarily glitches to 1. For the output $F$ to be intended to be 0 for both $S=0$ and $S=1$, the data inputs must be set as follows:\n- When $S=0$, we need $F=I_0=0$.\n- When $S=1$, we need $F=I_1=0$.\nThus, we must test for a static-0 hazard under the condition $I_0=0$ and $I_1=0$.\n\nLet's substitute these input values into our derived expression:\n$$F = (S+0) \\cdot (\\overline{S}+0)$$\nUsing the Boolean identity $X+0=X$:\n$$F = S \\cdot \\overline{S}$$\nThe expression $F = S\\overline{S}$ is the canonical example of a function with a static-0 hazard. Ideally, $S\\overline{S}$ is always 0. However, in a real circuit, the signal $\\overline{S}$ is generated from $S$ by an inverter (in our case, the first NOR gate), which has a finite propagation delay.\n\nConsider the transition of $S$ from 0 to 1.\n- At time $t<0$, $S=0$ and $\\overline{S}=1$. $F = 0 \\cdot 1 = 0$.\n- At some time $t_{glitch}$, $S$ has just become 1, but due to the inverter's delay, the signal $\\overline{S}$ has not yet become 0; it is still 1. For a brief moment, the inputs to the final logical AND operation are both 1.\n- During this glitch period, $F = 1 \\cdot 1 = 1$.\n- Shortly after, at time $t>t_{glitch}$, the inverter output updates, so $\\overline{S}$ becomes 0. The output returns to $F = 1 \\cdot 0 = 0$.\n\nThis temporary 0 -> 1 -> 0 pulse is a static-0 hazard. It occurs when $I_0=0$, $I_1=0$, and the select line $S$ transitions. This finding matches option B. Option D is incorrect because the hazard does not occur when the inputs are different. Option E is incorrect because a hazard has been found.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1974635"}, {"introduction": "In modern high-speed electronics, speed is as important as correctness.
