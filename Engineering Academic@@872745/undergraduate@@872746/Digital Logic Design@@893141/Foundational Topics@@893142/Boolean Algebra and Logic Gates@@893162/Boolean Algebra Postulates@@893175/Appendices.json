This first practice challenges you to simplify a logic expression for a hypothetical smart greenhouse controller by applying fundamental postulates like the idempotent and absorption laws.

The system's primary function is to manage a water valve, which is activated (output $V=1$) based on the logic derived from three different sensor inputs:\n- $M$: A soil moisture sensor signal. $M=1$ signifies dry soil, and $M=0$ signifies moist soil.\n- $T$: A timer signal. $T=1$ indicates the system is within a pre-scheduled watering time window, and $T=0$ indicates it is not.\n- $O$: A manual override signal. $O=1$ when a manual 'on' switch is pressed, and $O=0$ otherwise.\n\nA junior engineer has drafted an initial, unoptimized logic function for the valve controller based on these inputs. The function is given by the following Boolean expression:\n$$V(M, T, O) = (M' \\cdot T) + O + (M' \\cdot T) + T'$$\n\nIn this expression, the multiplication dot ($\\cdot$) represents the logical AND operation, the plus sign ($+$) represents the logical OR operation, and the prime symbol (e.g., $X'$) denotes the logical NOT (complement) of a variable.\n\nTo create a more efficient and cost-effective circuit, this expression must be simplified to its minimal sum-of-products form.
