The target function, which depends on four input variables $A$, $B$, $C$, and $D$, is given by the expression $F(A, B, C, D) = (A+B)(C+D)$. In this expression, the plus sign ($+$) denotes the logical OR operation, and the adjacent parentheses denote the logical AND operation.\n\nThe only components available to the student are 2-input NOR gates. A 2-input NOR gate with inputs $X$ and $Y$ produces an output equivalent to $\\overline{X+Y}$.\n\nCalculate the minimum number of 2-input NOR gates required to correctly implement the function $F(A, B, C, D)$.", "solution": "We need to implement the Boolean function $F(A,B,C,D) = (A+B)(C+D)$ using only 2-input NOR gates, each realizing $\\overline{X+Y}$ for inputs $X$ and $Y$.\n\nApply De Morgan's law to express $F$ directly in terms of NOR operations:\n$$\nF = (A+B)(C+D)\n= \\overline{\\overline{(A+B)(C+D)}}\n= \\overline{\\overline{A+B} + \\overline{C+D}}.\n$$\nThis expression shows that $F$ can be obtained as the NOR of the two intermediate signals $\\overline{A+B}$ and $\\overline{C+D}$.\n\nImplementation using 2-input NOR gates:\n1) Compute $N_{1} = \\overline{A+B}$ with one NOR gate taking inputs $A$ and $B$.\n2) Compute $N_{2} = \\overline{C+D}$ with one NOR gate taking inputs $C$ and $D$.\n3) Compute $F = \\overline{N_{1} + N_{2}}$ with one NOR gate taking inputs $N_{1}$ and $N_{2}$.\n\nThus, $F$ is realized with exactly $3$ NOR gates.\n\nTo show minimality, consider any circuit with at most two 2-input NOR gates. Let the first gate’s output depend on at most two of $\\{A,B,C,D\\}$. The second (final) NOR gate can take as inputs either:\n- the first gate’s output and one primary input, so the final output depends on at most three distinct primary inputs; or\n- two primary inputs, in which case the first gate is unused; or\n- two gate outputs, which is impossible with only one prior gate.\n\nTherefore, with only two NOR gates, the output can depend on at most three variables. However, $F$ depends on all four variables: for example, fixing $(B,C,D)=(0,1,0)$ yields $F=A$; fixing $(A,C,D)=(0,1,0)$ yields $F=B$; fixing $(A,B,D)=(1,0,0)$ yields $F=C$; fixing $(A,B,C)=(1,0,0)$ yields $F=D$. Hence at least three NOR gates are necessary, and since three suffice, the minimum is $3$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{3}$$", "id": "1969642"}, {"introduction": "Building on the fundamentals, we now tackle a more complex design: a 3-input even parity checker. This problem moves beyond simple expression conversion to modular circuit synthesis, where you must first construct intermediate logic functions using NOR gates. Successfully solving this demonstrates the hierarchical approach to digital design, a crucial skill for creating sophisticated systems from simple components [@problem_id:1969655].", "problem": "In digital logic design, NOR gates are considered universal gates because any Boolean function can be implemented using only NOR gates. Consider a 3-input digital circuit with inputs designated as $A$, $B$, and $C$.

Note that zero is considered an even number.\n\nDetermine the minimum number of 2-input NOR gates required to implement this 3-input even parity checker.", "solution": "The goal is to find the minimum number of 2-input NOR gates to implement a 3-input even parity checker.\n\nFirst, let's establish the truth table for the function. The output $P$ is '1' if the number of '1's in the inputs $\\{A, B, C\\}$ is even (0 or 2).\n\n| A | B | C | Number of '1's | Output P |\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n| 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 (even)       | 1        |\n| 0 | 0 | 1 | 1 (odd)        | 0        |\n| 0 | 1 | 0 | 1 (odd)        | 0        |\n| 0 | 1 | 1 | 2 (even)       | 1        |\n| 1 | 0 | 0 | 1 (odd)        | 0        |\n| 1 | 0 | 1 | 2 (even)       | 1        |\n| 1 | 1 | 0 | 2 (even)       | 1        |\n| 1 | 1 | 1 | 3 (odd)        | 0        |\n\nThis truth table corresponds to the 3-input XNOR function. The odd parity function corresponds to the 3-input XOR function ($A \\oplus B \\oplus C$). Our even parity function $P$ is the complement of the odd parity function. Therefore, the Boolean expression for $P$ is:\n$$P = (A \\oplus B \\oplus C)'$$\nwhere $\\oplus$ denotes the XOR operation.\n\nUsing the properties of XOR and XNOR (denoted by $\\odot$), we know that $(X \\oplus Y)' = X \\odot Y$. Applying this to our expression:\n$$P = ((A \\oplus B) \\oplus C)' = (A \\oplus B) \\odot C$$\nThis expression breaks the problem down into two stages:\n1.  First, compute $X = A \\oplus B$.\n2.  Then, compute $P = X \\odot C$.\n\nWe need to implement these two stages using only 2-input NOR gates.\n\n**Stage 1: Implementation of 2-input XOR ($X = A \\oplus B$)**\n\nA standard and efficient way to build an XOR gate from NOR gates is to first build an XNOR gate and then invert its output. A 2-input XNOR gate, $A \\odot B = (A'B + AB')'$, can be implemented with 4 NOR gates as follows, where $G_i$ represents the output of gate $i$:\nLet's analyze the circuit:\n$G_1 = A \\text{ NOR } B = (A+B)'$\n$G_2 = A \\text{ NOR } G_1 = (A + (A+B)')' = A'(A+B) = A'B$\n$G_3 = B \\text{ NOR } G_1 = (B + (A+B)')' = B'(A+B) = AB'$\n$G_4 = G_2 \\text{ NOR } G_3 = (A'B + AB')' = A \\odot B$\n\nSo, a 2-input XNOR requires 4 NOR gates. To get the XOR function, $A \\oplus B$, we must invert the output of the XNOR gate. An inverter is created with one NOR gate by tying its inputs together:\n$X = G_4' = G_4 \\text{ NOR } G_4 = (A \\odot B)' = A \\oplus B$\n\nThus, implementing the 2-input XOR function ($X = A \\oplus B$) requires $4 + 1 = 5$ NOR gates.\n\n**Stage 2: Implementation of 2-input XNOR ($P = X \\odot C$)**\n\nAs derived in the previous step, a 2-input XNOR gate can be constructed from 4 NOR gates. We use the output $X$ from Stage 1 and the input $C$ as inputs to this XNOR block.\n$G_5 = X \\text{ NOR } C$\n$G_6 = X \\text{ NOR } G_5$\n$G_7 = C \\text{ NOR } G_5$\n$P = G_8 = G_6 \\text{ NOR } G_7 = X \\odot C$\n\nThis stage requires 4 NOR gates.\n\n**Total Gate Count**\n\nThe total minimum number of gates is the sum of the gates from both stages. No gates can be shared between these two modular blocks in a way that reduces the total count.\nTotal Gates = (Gates for $A \\oplus B$) + (Gates for $X \\odot C$)\nTotal Gates = 5 + 4 = 9.\n\nBy virtue of symmetry, an equivalent implementation would be $A \\oplus (B \\odot C)$, which would require 4 gates for the XNOR block and 5 gates for the XOR block, again totaling 9 gates. This modular approach is a standard method for constructing such circuits and yields the minimum number of gates.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{9}$$", "id": "1969655"}, {"introduction": "Our final practice bridges the gap between ideal logic and the physical reality of electronics by examining the SR latch, a fundamental memory element built from cross-coupled NOR gates.

The latch is implemented using two identical cross-coupled 2-input NOR gates. The output of the first NOR gate is designated Q, and its inputs are the R signal and the output of the second NOR gate. The output of the second NOR gate is conventionally the complement of Q, and its inputs are the S signal and the output Q.\n\nThe key timing characteristics of the circuit are as follows:\n- The propagation delay of each NOR gate, $t_{pd}$, is $0.50$ ns.\n- The hold time requirement for the latch, $t_h$, is defined as the minimum time interval by which the de-assertion of the two inputs must be separated to guarantee a predictable, stable output. For this particular latch design, it is established that $t_h = t_{pd}$. A failure to meet this hold time results in the latch entering a metastable state.\n- The metastability time constant of the latch, $\\tau$, is $0.20$ ns.\n\nInitially, both inputs S and R are at a logic low (0), and the latch is in a stable state. Due to a fault condition in the upstream circuitry, both S and R are simultaneously asserted to logic high (1). Shortly after, the signals are de-asserted (returned to logic low).

The R signal transitions from high to low at time $t_R = 10.35$ ns.\n\nWhen the latch enters a metastable state, the probability $P$ that it remains in this indeterminate state after a waiting time $t_{wait}$ is described by the exponential decay model $P(t_{wait}) = \\exp(-t_{wait}/\\tau)$.
