By identifying the flawed step in the reasoning, you will reinforce your understanding of why these rules are not just conventions, but are essential for preserving logical equivalence during simplification.", "problem": "A junior digital systems designer is tasked with creating the logic for a safety-critical pump controller. The pump, represented by the output `P`, should turn on (`P=1`) under the following condition: the system's primary sensor indicates low water level (`L=0`), OR the primary sensor indicates a normal water level (`L=1`) AND a manual override command (`M=1`) is issued by an operator. The designer uses `L'` to represent the case where the water level is low.\n\nThe designer documents the following four-step simplification process for the control logic:\n1.  **Initial Expression Formulation**: Based on the verbal description, the logic is captured as `P = L' + L · M`.\n2.  **Term Grouping**: The designer regroups the terms to prioritize the operation on the `L` and `L'` variables, rewriting the expression as `P = (L' + L) · M`.\n3.  **Complement Law Application**: The designer simplifies the grouped term `(L' + L)` to `1`, leading to the expression `P = 1 · M`.\n4.  **Identity Law Application**: The designer performs the final simplification, concluding that `P = M`.\n\nThe final simplified logic, `P = M`, implies that the pump's operation is solely dependent on the manual override command, which contradicts the initial requirement that the pump should also turn on when the water level is low. Which step in the designer's simplification process contains the fundamental logical error that leads to this incorrect conclusion?\n\nA. Step 1: The initial expression `P = L' + L · M` does not correctly model the verbal description of the system's requirements.\n\nB. Step 2: The regrouping of `L' + L · M` into `(L' + L) · M` is based on an incorrect application of algebraic laws.\n\nC. Step 3: The simplification of the term `(L' + L)` to `1` is an invalid operation in Boolean algebra.\n\nD. Step 4: The simplification of the term `1 · M` to `M` is an invalid operation in Boolean algebra.", "solution": "Translate the requirement into Boolean algebra. The pump output is on when the level is low or when the level is normal and there is a manual override. Using $L'$ to denote low level (the complement of $L$), the natural expression is\n$$\nP=L'+L\\cdot M.\n$$\nThis matches the specification: if $L=0$ then $L'=1$ so the first term forces $P=1$; if $L=1$ then $L'=0$ and the expression reduces to $P=M$, so the pump turns on only when $M=1$.\n\nEvaluate each simplification step:\n- Step 1 is correct, as just shown.\n- Step 2 rewrites $L' + L\\cdot M$ as $(L' + L)\\cdot M$. This is not a valid Boolean algebra transformation. The correct distributive identity is\n$$\nX + YZ = (X+Y)(X+Z),\n$$\nnot $(X+Y)Z$. Applying the correct identity with $X=L'$, $Y=L$, $Z=M$ gives\n$$\nL' + L\\cdot M = (L'+L)(L'+M) = 1\\cdot(L'+M) = L'+M,\n$$\nwhich is not equal to $(L'+L)\\cdot M = 1\\cdot M = M$ in general. Therefore Step 2 is the fundamental logical error: it misapplies the distributive law.\n- Step 3 uses the complement law $L'+L=1$, which is valid.\n- Step 4 uses the identity law $1\\cdot M=M$, which is also valid.\n\nThus, the incorrect conclusion arises from the invalid regrouping in Step 2.
