A value of 1 indicates the sensor is 'ON' (detecting a condition), and a value of 0 indicates it is 'OFF'. An alarm, represented by the output F, is triggered (F=1) under specific conditions. The system logic dictates that the alarm must be activated if sensor C is ON. Alternatively, the alarm is also activated if sensor A is OFF while sensor B is ON. Otherwise, the alarm remains OFF (F=0).\n\nYour task is to design a logic circuit that implements this safety protocol. The design must exclusively use 2-input NAND gates.

Using De Morgan on the sum,\n$$\nB'+A=(BA')',\n$$\nso $Y$ is the output of a NAND fed by $B$ and $A'$.\n\nThus a NAND-only implementation is:\n- Invert $A$ to get $A'$ using a NAND inverter: $\\operatorname{NAND}(A,A)=A'$.\n- Form $Y=(BA')'$ with a NAND: $\\operatorname{NAND}(B,A')$.\n- Invert $C$ to get $C'$ using a NAND inverter: $\\operatorname{NAND}(C,C)=C'$.\n- Produce $F$ as the NAND of $C'$ and $Y$: $F=\\operatorname{NAND}(C', (BA')')=\\big[C'(B'+A)\\big]'=C+BA'$.\n\nGate count: two inverters (for $A'$ and $C'$) plus two NANDs for combining, totaling $4$ two-input NAND gates.\n\nTo see minimality, note that $F$ is negative-unate in $A$ and positive-unate in $B$ and $C$. In a NAND-only network each gate contributes one inversion along a signal’s path. Achieving negative unateness for $A$ requires an odd inversion count on $A$’s path, which necessitates at least one explicit inversion of $A$ before the two-level NAND structure. Simultaneously, preserving positive unateness for $C$ requires an even inversion count on $C$’s path; feeding $C$ only into the final NAND would yield a single inversion (odd), so $C$ must be inverted once before the final NAND (or pass through an additional NAND level), which adds another gate. Together with the final combination and the $BA'$ term formation, this forces at least $4$ two-input NAND gates.
