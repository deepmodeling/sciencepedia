We can rearrange the terms inside the parentheses.\n$$G = \\overline{X \\oplus Y \\oplus X \\oplus Z} = \\overline{(X \\oplus X) \\oplus (Y \\oplus Z)}$$\n\nA key property of the XOR operation is that any variable XORed with itself is 0, i.e., $X \\oplus X = 0$.\n$$G = \\overline{0 \\oplus (Y \\oplus Z)}$$\n\nAnother property of XOR is that any variable XORed with 0 is the variable itself, i.e., $0 \\oplus P = P$.\n$$G = \\overline{Y \\oplus Z}$$\n\nFinally, by the definition of the XNOR operation, $\\overline{Y \\oplus Z} = Y \\odot Z$.\nSo, we have derived the general simplification identity:\n$$(X \\odot Y) \\odot (X \\odot Z) = Y \\odot Z$$\n\nNow we can apply this identity to the original function $F(A, B, C, D) = (A \\odot (B \\odot C)) \\odot (A \\odot D)$.\nBy setting $X=A$, $Y=B \\odot C$, and $Z=D$, the function simplifies to:\n$$F(A, B, C, D) = Y \\odot Z = (B \\odot C) \\odot D$$\n\nThe simplified expression for the function is $F = (B \\odot C) \\odot D$.\n\nThe final step is to determine the minimum number of 2-input XNOR gates required to implement this simplified function.
