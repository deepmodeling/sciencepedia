{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "This first practice exercise places you in the role of a systems engineer designing a safety protocol for an industrial reactor. The goal is to translate a set of operational rules, including a redundant safety measure, into a Boolean expression and then simplify it. This problem [@problem_id:1907242] is an excellent starting point because it demonstrates a key aspect of the absorption theorem: its applicability to compound expressions, not just single variables. You will learn to recognize the pattern $X + XY = X$ even when $X$ represents a more complex term like $(A+B)$.", "problem": "A safety control system for an industrial chemical reactor is being designed. The system relies on three binary sensor inputs to determine whether to initiate an emergency shutdown procedure. The inputs are represented by Boolean variables:\n- $A=1$ if the reactor temperature is above the critical threshold, and $A=0$ otherwise.\n- $B=1$ if the reactor pressure is above the critical threshold, and $B=0$ otherwise.\n- $C=1$ if a manual emergency shutdown override has been activated by an operator, and $C=0$ otherwise.\n\nThe shutdown signal, denoted by the Boolean function $S(A, B, C)$, is activated (i.e., $S=1$) according to the following logic specified by the lead engineer:\n\"The system must shut down if the temperature or the pressure is above its critical threshold. Additionally, as a redundant measure, the system must also shut down if both of the following conditions are met simultaneously: (1) the temperature or the pressure is above its critical threshold, and (2) the manual emergency shutdown override has been activated.\"\n\nYour task is to analyze this specification and derive the simplest possible Boolean expression for the shutdown signal $S(A, B, C)$. In your expression, use the `+` symbol for the logical OR operation and implicit multiplication for the logical AND operation (e.g., $XY$ for $X$ AND $Y$).", "solution": "Let $A$, $B$, and $C$ be Boolean variables as defined. Translating the engineer’s specification into Boolean logic:\n- The condition \"shut down if the temperature or the pressure is above its critical threshold\" gives the term $A + B$.\n- The additional redundant condition \"shut down if both (temperature or pressure above threshold) and (manual override activated)\" gives the term $(A + B)C$.\nCombining these with logical OR, the shutdown signal is\n$$S(A,B,C) = (A + B) + (A + B)C.$$\nTo simplify, let $X = A + B$. Then\n$$S = X + XC.$$\nBy the absorption law of Boolean algebra, $X + XY = X$ for any Boolean variables $X$ and $Y$. Using this with $Y = C$, we obtain\n$$S = X = A + B.$$\nEquivalently, using distribution and identity: $X + XC = X(1 + C)$ and since $1 + C = 1$, this yields $S = X \\cdot 1 = X = A + B$. Thus the simplest expression is $A + B$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A+B}$$", "id": "1907242"}, {"introduction": "Understanding the precise conditions under which a mathematical theorem applies is just as important as knowing the theorem itself. This exercise [@problem_id:1907259] presents a common error made by students learning Boolean algebra, where the absorption law is misapplied to an expression of the form $X + X'Y$. By analyzing this mistake, you will sharpen your understanding of why the absorption law works and solidify your ability to distinguish a valid application from an invalid one. This critical thinking is essential for avoiding subtle but significant errors in circuit design.", "problem": "A student in an introductory digital logic design course is simplifying a Boolean expression as part of a circuit optimization task. In one of their simplification steps, they take the expression $F(X, Y) = X + X'Y$ and reduce it to $F(X, Y) = X$. The student justifies this step by claiming it is a direct application of the Absorption Law.\n\nWhich of the following statements provides the most accurate and fundamental explanation for the logical error in the student's reasoning?\n\nA. The simplification is incorrect because the Absorption Law, which is correctly stated as $A + AB = A$, cannot be applied. The student's expression $X + X'Y$ does not match the required form, as the second term's Boolean product must contain the variable $X$ itself, not its complement $X'$.\n\nB. The student mistakenly applied the Idempotent Law ($A+A=A$) instead of the Absorption Law.\n\nC. The student's reasoning is flawed because the expression $X + X'Y$ cannot be simplified further and must be left in its original form.\n\nD. The simplification is incorrect because the correct law to apply is the Distributive Law, which simplifies the expression to $F(X,Y)=Y$ because $X+X'$ cancels out.\n\nE. The student has confused the Absorption Law with its dual form, $A(A+B)=A$, which is the only version that allows for a complement to be present.", "solution": "We start by recalling the Absorption Law and its dual in Boolean algebra:\n$$A + AB = A \\quad \\text{and} \\quad A(A + B) = A.$$\nIn both identities, the literal $A$ appears unchanged in both the isolated term and as a factor in the product term. Specifically, the law requires the same variable (not its complement) to appear as the common factor.\n\nConsider the student's expression $F(X,Y) = X + X'Y$. To apply the Absorption Law $A + AB = A$, the second term would need to be of the form $XY$, not $X'Y$. Since the product term contains $X'$ instead of $X$, the expression $X + X'Y$ does not match the required form of the Absorption Law. Therefore, the law cannot be directly applied, which is the fundamental error in the student's reasoning.\n\nTo see the correct simplification path and to confirm that $X + X'Y \\neq X$ in general, use the distributive identity $a + bc = (a + b)(a + c)$:\n$$X + X'Y = (X + X')(X + Y).$$\nUsing the complementarity law $X + X' = 1$, we get\n$$(X + X')(X + Y) = 1 \\cdot (X + Y) = X + Y,$$\nby the identity law $1 \\cdot Z = Z$. Thus the correct simplification is $X + X'Y = X + Y$, not $X$.\n\nA concrete counterexample also demonstrates the student's result is not generally valid: if $X = 0$ and $Y = 1$, then\n$$X + X'Y = 0 + 1 \\cdot 1 = 1 \\neq 0 = X.$$\n\nTherefore, the most accurate and fundamental explanation is that the Absorption Law cannot be applied because the given expression does not match its required form; the second term must contain $X$, not $X'$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1907259"}, {"introduction": "Real-world circuit simplification is rarely a one-step process.
