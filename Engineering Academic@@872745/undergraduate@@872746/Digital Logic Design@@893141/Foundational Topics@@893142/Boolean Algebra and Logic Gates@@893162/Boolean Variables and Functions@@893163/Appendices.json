The sensors are:\n- Sensor $A$: Detects altitude. $A=1$ if altitude is too high, $A=0$ otherwise.\n- Sensor $B$: Detects battery level. $B=1$ if the battery is critically low, $B=0$ otherwise.\n- Sensor $C$: Detects proximity to an obstacle. $C=1$ if an obstacle is too close, $C=0$ otherwise.\n\nThe RTH command, represented by a Boolean function $F$, is activated ($F=1$) if and only if any one of the following four specific combinations of sensor readings occurs:\n1. Altitude is not too high, battery is not critically low, and an obstacle is too close.\n2. Altitude is not too high, battery is critically low, and an obstacle is too close.\n3. Altitude is too high, battery is not critically low, and no obstacle is too close.\n4. Altitude is too high, battery is not critically low, and an obstacle is too close.\n\nTo implement the logic for the RTH command efficiently, engineers must derive the corresponding Boolean expression for $F$ in terms of $A$, $B$, and $C$ that has the absolute minimum number of literals. A literal is defined as a variable or its complement (e.g., $A$ or $\\neg A$). Assume the simplified expression is required to be in a sum-of-products form.

Therefore at least two product terms are required.

Learning to correctly identify and notate these conditions is the first step toward creating highly optimized and efficient logic circuits.", "problem": "A safety monitoring system for an industrial pump is being designed. The system uses three binary sensors to determine whether to trigger an emergency shutdown. The sensors are for Pressure (`P`), Temperature (`T`), and Vibration (`V`). Each sensor outputs a `0` for a normal reading and a `1` for a high/abnormal reading. The shutdown signal, `S`, is `1` if an emergency shutdown is required and `0` otherwise.\n\nThe three sensor outputs are treated as a 3-bit binary number `PTV`, where `P` is the Most Significant Bit (MSB) and `V` is the Least Significant Bit (LSB). The system's behavior is dictated by the following critical design specifications:\n\n1.  A known faulty state, corresponding to the input `(P=0, T=0, V=1)`, must always trigger a shutdown.\n2.  A normal startup transient, corresponding to the input `(P=1, T=0, V=0)`, must never trigger a shutdown.\n3.  The input combination `(P=1, T=1, V=1)` is considered physically impossible due to mechanical constraints in the pump. The system's response to this input is therefore irrelevant, and it can be treated as a \"don't care\" condition.\n4.  For all other possible input combinations not explicitly mentioned above, the system is considered to be operating in a safe state, and the shutdown signal must be `0`.\n\nYour task is to express the shutdown logic function `S(P, T, V)` in the canonical sum-of-minterms notation. The expression should explicitly list the decimal indices of the minterms for which the function `S` must be true and the decimal indices of the \"don't care\" minterms. The required format is `Σm(...) + d(...)`, where the first list contains the true minterms and the second list contains the don't care minterms.", "solution": "We treat the three sensor outputs as a 3-bit binary number $PTV$ with $P$ as the most significant bit (weight $4$), $T$ as the middle bit (weight $2$), and $V$ as the least significant bit (weight $1$).

Its index is $i=4\\cdot 1 + 2\\cdot 0 + 0 = 4$, so it is not included in the true minterms and is not a don't care.\n- The input $(P,T,V)=(1,1,1)$ is physically impossible, so it is a don't care. Its index is $i=4\\cdot 1 + 2\\cdot 1 + 1 = 7$, so minterm $m_{7}$ is included in the don't care set.\n- All other input combinations not mentioned are safe and must yield $S=0$, so no other minterms are included in the sum or the don't care set.\n\nEnumerating all $8$ combinations confirms that only index $1$ is a true minterm, and only index $7$ is a don't care.
