The variables and their complements are left unchanged.\n\nConsider the Boolean Consensus Theorem for three variables $X$, $Y$, and $Z$. One form of this theorem is given by the identity:\n$$XY + X'Z + YZ = XY + X'Z$$\n\nYour task is to first derive the dual of this theorem.

The principle of duality states that we must interchange AND operators with OR operators, and OR operators with AND operators. In the expression $XY$, the AND operator is implicit.\n\nThe original identity is:\n$$ (X \\cdot Y) + (X' \\cdot Z) + (Y \\cdot Z) = (X \\cdot Y) + (X' \\cdot Z) $$\n\nTo find the dual, we replace each `·` with `+` and each `+` with `·`.\n\nLet's transform the left-hand side (LHS):\nOriginal LHS: $(X \\cdot Y) + (X' \\cdot Z) + (Y \\cdot Z)$\nDual of LHS: $(X + Y) \\cdot (X' + Z) \\cdot (Y + Z)$\n\nNow, let's transform the right-hand side (RHS):\nOriginal RHS: $(X \\cdot Y) + (X' \\cdot Z)$\nDual of RHS: $(X + Y) \\cdot (X' + Z)$\n\nSo, the dual identity to be verified is:\n$$ (X+Y)(X'+Z)(Y+Z) = (X+Y)(X'+Z) $$\n\nNext, we construct a truth table to verify this dual identity.
