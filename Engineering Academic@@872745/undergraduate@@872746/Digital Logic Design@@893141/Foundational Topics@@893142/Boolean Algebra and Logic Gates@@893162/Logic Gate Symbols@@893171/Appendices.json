Therefore, the single gate that directly implements $F$ is a three-input NAND gate.\n\nIn ANSI (distinctive-shape) symbols, an AND gate is depicted as having a straight (flat) input side and a curved output side. A small circle (bubble) placed at the output of this shape denotes logical inversion at the output.

Neither equals $\\overline{A \\cdot B \\cdot C}$.\n- Option E: An AND gate without an output bubble computes $A \\cdot B \\cdot C$, not its complement.\n\nTherefore, the correct ANSI gate description for $F=\\overline{A \\cdot B \\cdot C}$ is Option A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1944596"}, {"introduction": "Beyond recognizing basic gates, a key skill is understanding how simple modifications to their symbols alter their function.

This exercise addresses a common real-world scenario: how to correctly handle unused inputs on a logic gate to ensure the circuit functions reliably and predictably. Solving this requires you to think beyond the symbol and consider the underlying algebraic properties of the gate's operation. [@problem_id:1944570]", "problem": "In digital circuit design, it is common to have integrated circuits (ICs) with more inputs than required for a specific application. To ensure predictable and reliable operation, these unused inputs must be terminated correctly. Consider a scenario where a designer has access to 4-input NAND gates and 4-input NOR gates but needs to implement a 3-input NAND function and a 3-input NOR function using them.\n\nLet the three active inputs be $A$, $B$, and $C$. To convert a 4-input gate into a 3-input gate, the single unused input must be connected in a way that does not alter the intended 3-input logic function. For the purposes of this problem, \"Logic High\" refers to connecting the input to the positive supply voltage ($V_{CC}$), representing a binary '1'. \"Logic Low\" refers to connecting the input to ground (GND), representing a binary '0'.\n\nBelow is a list of proposed procedures for handling the unused input on a 4-input gate to realize a 3-input function of the same type (e.g., 4-input NAND becomes 3-input NAND).\n\nA.

For either the NAND or NOR gate, leave the unused input disconnected (floating).\n\nIdentify all the procedures from the list that correctly and reliably implement the desired 3-input logic function. Your answer should be a string containing the uppercase letters of all valid options in alphabetical order.", "solution": "To determine which procedures are valid, we must analyze the Boolean expressions for each case and see if the 4-input gate behaves as a 3-input gate of the same type. Let the three active inputs be $A$, $B$, and $C$, and the unused input be $D$.\n\nFirst, let's analyze the 4-input NAND gate. The Boolean expression for a 4-input NAND gate is $Y = \\overline{A \\cdot B \\cdot C \\cdot D}$. The desired function is a 3-input NAND, which has the expression $Y = \\overline{A \\cdot B \\cdot C}$. For the 4-input gate to behave as a 3-input gate, we need the effect of input $D$ to be neutral. This means we must find a value for $D$ such that $\\overline{A \\cdot B \\cdot C \\cdot D}$ simplifies to $\\overline{A \\cdot B \\cdot C}$. This requires the expression inside the inversion, $A \\cdot B \\cdot C \\cdot D$, to be equivalent to $A \\cdot B \\cdot C$. The identity element for the AND ($\\cdot$) operation is 1. If we set $D=1$ (Logic High), the expression becomes $Y = \\overline{A \\cdot B \\cdot C \\cdot 1} = \\overline{A \\cdot B \\cdot C}$. This is the correct 3-input NAND function. Therefore, procedure **A** is valid. If we set $D=0$ (Logic Low), the expression becomes $Y = \\overline{A \\cdot B \\cdot C \\cdot 0} = \\overline{0} = 1$. The output is permanently fixed at Logic High, which is not the desired 3-input NAND function. Therefore, procedure **B** is invalid.\n\nNext, let's analyze the 4-input NOR gate. The Boolean expression for a 4-input NOR gate is $Y = \\overline{A + B + C + D}$. The desired function is a 3-input NOR, which has the expression $Y = \\overline{A + B + C}$. For the 4-input gate to behave as a 3-input gate, we need the expression inside the inversion, $A + B + C + D$, to be equivalent to $A + B + C$. The identity element for the OR ($+$) operation is 0. If we set $D=0$ (Logic Low), the expression becomes $Y = \\overline{A + B + C + 0} = \\overline{A + B + C}$. This is the correct 3-input NOR function. Therefore, procedure **D** is valid. If we set $D=1$ (Logic High), the expression becomes $Y = \\overline{A + B + C + 1} = \\overline{1} = 0$. The output is permanently fixed at Logic Low, which is not the desired 3-input NOR function. Therefore, procedure **C** is invalid.\n\nNow, let's analyze the procedure of connecting the unused input to one of the active inputs. Let's tie input $D$ to input $A$, so $D = A$.\nFor the NAND gate, the expression becomes $Y = \\overline{A \\cdot B \\cdot C \\cdot A}$. According to the idempotent law of Boolean algebra ($X \\cdot X = X$), we have $A \\cdot A = A$. So, the expression simplifies to $Y = \\overline{A \\cdot B \\cdot C}$. This correctly implements a 3-input NAND function.\nFor the NOR gate, the expression becomes $Y = \\overline{A + B + C + A}$. According to the idempotent law ($X + X = X$), we have $A + A = A$. So, the expression simplifies to $Y = \\overline{A + B + C}$. This correctly implements a 3-input NOR function.\nSince this method works for both types of gates, procedure **E** is valid.\n\nFinally, let's analyze the case of leaving the input floating. In practical digital electronics, especially with Complementary Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor (CMOS) and Transistor-Transistor Logic (TTL) families, a floating input does not have a defined logic level. It can be susceptible to noise and may cause the gate to oscillate or draw excessive current, leading to unpredictable behavior and potential damage to the IC. It is a fundamentally unreliable design practice. Therefore, procedure **F** is invalid.\n\nIn summary, the valid procedures are A (NAND input to Logic High), D (NOR input to Logic Low), and E (tying the unused input to an active input for either gate).", "answer": "$$\\boxed{ADE}$$", "id": "1944570"}]}
