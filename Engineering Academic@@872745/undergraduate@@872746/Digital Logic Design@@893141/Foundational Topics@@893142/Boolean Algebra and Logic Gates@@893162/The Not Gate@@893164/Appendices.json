This problem moves beyond ideal logic to the practical realm of circuit analysis and fault diagnosis. By analyzing a CMOS inverter with a \"stuck-open\" fault, you will learn to connect abstract logical states to concrete physical realities like voltage levels and high-impedance states, a crucial skill for any hardware engineer [@problem_id:1969985].", "problem": "A standard Complementary Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor (CMOS) inverter is a fundamental building block in digital electronics. It consists of a p-channel Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor (PMOS) transistor in the pull-up network and an n-channel Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor (NMOS) transistor in the pull-down network. The inverter is powered by a supply voltage $V_{DD}$ with respect to a ground reference of 0 V. The input voltage is $V_{in}$ and the output voltage is $V_{out}$. The NMOS transistor has a positive threshold voltage $V_{Tn}$, and the PMOS transistor has a negative threshold voltage $V_{Tp}$.\n\nConsider a scenario where a specific inverter on a chip has a manufacturing defect. The PMOS transistor is \"stuck-open,\" meaning it behaves as a perfect open circuit between its source and drain terminals, regardless of the input voltage. The output of this faulty inverter is connected to an external load, which can be modeled by a resistor $R_U$ connected between the output node and $V_{DD}$, and a resistor $R_D$ connected between the output node and ground.\n\nThe input to this faulty inverter, $V_{in}$, is held steady at 0 V. For this analysis, assume the NMOS transistor functions as an ideal switch, acting as a perfect open circuit when in its cutoff state and a perfect short circuit when \"on.\"\n\nDetermine the steady-state output voltage $V_{out}$. Your answer should be a symbolic expression in terms of $V_{DD}$, $R_U$, and $R_D$.", "solution": "The problem asks for the steady-state output voltage $V_{out}$ of a faulty CMOS inverter. The input voltage is given as $V_{in} = 0$ V.\n\nFirst, we analyze the state of the two transistors that form the inverter under the given conditions.\n\n1.  **PMOS Transistor State:**\n    The problem states that the PMOS transistor is \"stuck-open.\" This is a fault condition which means it acts as a perfect open circuit, creating an infinite resistance between its source (connected to $V_{DD}$) and its drain (the output node $V_{out}$). This state is independent of the input voltage. Therefore, the pull-up network is disconnected from the output node.\n\n2.  **NMOS Transistor State:**\n    The NMOS transistor's state depends on its gate-to-source voltage, $V_{GS,n}$. The gate of the NMOS is connected to the inverter input, so its gate voltage is $V_G = V_{in} = 0$ V. The source of the NMOS is connected to ground, so its source voltage is $V_S = 0$ V.\n    The gate-to-source voltage is calculated as:\n    $$V_{GS,n} = V_G - V_S = 0 \\text{ V} - 0 \\text{ V} = 0 \\text{ V}$$\n    An NMOS transistor turns on (enters the linear or saturation region) only if its gate-to-source voltage exceeds its threshold voltage, i.e., $V_{GS,n}  V_{Tn}$. The problem states that $V_{Tn}$ is a positive value.\n    Since $V_{GS,n} = 0$ V, the condition $V_{GS,n}  V_{Tn}$ is not met. Therefore, the NMOS transistor is in the **cutoff** region. According to the ideal switch model specified in the problem, a transistor in the cutoff state acts as a perfect open circuit. This means there is an infinite resistance between the NMOS transistor's drain (the output node $V_{out}$) and its source (ground).\n\n3.  **Output Node Analysis:**\n    We have established that:\n    - The PMOS transistor provides an open circuit between $V_{DD}$ and $V_{out}$.\n    - The NMOS transistor provides an open circuit between $V_{out}$ and ground.\n    This means the output node $V_{out}$ is electrically disconnected from the inverter's internal power and ground connections. The output is in a high-impedance state (often denoted as 'Z') with respect to the inverter's own pull-up and pull-down networks.\n\n4.  **Effect of the External Load:**\n    The output voltage is not indeterminate because it is connected to an external load network. This network consists of a resistor $R_U$ connected between $V_{out}$ and $V_{DD}$, and a resistor $R_D$ connected between $V_{out}$ and ground.\n    Since the inverter itself presents an open circuit to the output node, the entire circuit seen from the output node simplifies to just the external load network. This network is a simple voltage divider. The resistors $R_U$ and $R_D$ are in series across the total potential difference of $V_{DD} - 0 = V_{DD}$.\n\n5.  **Calculating the Output Voltage:**\n    The output voltage $V_{out}$ is the voltage at the node between $R_U$ and $R_D$. We can find this using the voltage divider formula:\n    $$V_{out} = V_{DD} \\times \\frac{\\text{Resistance from the node to ground}}{\\text{Total series resistance}}$$\n    In this case, the resistance from the node to ground is $R_D$, and the total series resistance is $R_U + R_D$.\n    Plugging these into the formula gives:\n    $$V_{out} = V_{DD} \\frac{R_D}{R_U + R_D}$$\n    This is the final expression for the steady-state output voltage.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{V_{DD} \\frac{R_D}{R_U + R_D}}$$", "id": "1969985"}]}
