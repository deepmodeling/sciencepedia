A central warning light on the dashboard is designed to illuminate if a fault is detected in *at least one* of these four subsystems.\n\nAssuming each sensor's output is independent and can be either `0` or `1`, determine the total number of distinct four-signal combinations from the sensors that will cause the warning light to illuminate.", "solution": "Each subsystem's sensor output is binary, so each sensor has $2$ possible outputs. With four independent sensors, the multiplication principle gives the total number of four-signal combinations as\n$$\n2^{4}.\n$$\nThe warning light illuminates if at least one sensor outputs $1$. Using the complement principle, the number of combinations that do not trigger the light corresponds to the case with no faults, i.e., all four outputs are $0$, which is exactly\n$$\n1\n$$\ncombination.\n\nTherefore, the number of combinations that do trigger the warning light is\n$$\n2^{4} - 1 = 16 - 1 = 15.\n$$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{15}$$", "id": "1970234"}, {"introduction": "While it's easy to think of logic gates as fundamental building blocks, some gates are \"universal\" and can be used to construct any other logic function.
