The device's central microcontroller needs to manage two primary independent hardware resources: a set of radio frequency channels for communication and a section of memory for storing sensor data.\n\nThe specifications are as follows:\n1.  The device must be capable of selecting one of $C$ distinct radio frequency channels. The total number of available channels is $C = 150$.\n2.  The device uses a memory module that contains $M$ unique, addressable locations for data logging. The total number of memory locations is $M = 4096$.\n\nTo manage these resources, the microcontroller uses two separate, dedicated hardware registers: a 'Channel Selection Register' to store the identifier of the currently selected channel, and a 'Memory Address Register' to store the address of the memory location being accessed. Each register must be able to hold a unique binary code for every possible state it needs to represent (i.e., every channel or every memory address).\n\nCalculate the minimum total number of binary bits (flip-flops) required to construct both the Channel Selection Register and the Memory Address Register.", "solution": "To represent $N$ distinct states in binary using a register, the minimum number of bits $k$ required is the smallest integer such that $2^{k} \\geq N$, equivalently $k = \\lceil \\log_{2}(N) \\rceil$.
