For a 6-bit word $b_{5}b_{4}b_{3}b_{2}b_{1}b_{0}$, if $b_{5}=0$ the value is the usual unsigned sum, and if $b_{5}=1$ the value is negative, equal to the negative of the two's complement magnitude.\n\nRegister $R1$ has $011011_{2}$ with most significant bit $0$, hence it is nonnegative and its value is computed by positional weights:\n$$\n\\operatorname{val}(R1)=0\\cdot 2^{5}+1\\cdot 2^{4}+1\\cdot 2^{3}+0\\cdot 2^{2}+1\\cdot 2^{1}+1\\cdot 2^{0}=16+8+2+1=27.\n$$\n\nRegister $R2$ has $101010_{2}$ with most significant bit $1$, hence it is negative.

This practice explores the crucial distinction between signed and unsigned numbers, a common source of bugs in low-level programming. By performing a single binary addition and analyzing the outcome from both perspectives, you will learn to calculate results for unsigned types and to identify arithmetic overflow for signed types—a critical skill for ensuring the correctness of digital computations.", "problem": "A custom-designed 8-bit microprocessor for an embedded system represents signed integers using the two's complement format. The Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) within this processor is tasked with adding two values originating from different system status registers. The two values are provided as the hexadecimal numbers `B4` and `9A`. Your task is to perform this addition as the ALU would. After the addition, the 8-bit binary result is used for two separate purposes: as an unsigned integer for a checksum calculation, and for an overflow check on the signed operation.\n\nDetermine:\n1. The value of the 8-bit sum when interpreted as an *unsigned* integer, expressed in decimal.\n2. A single binary digit indicating the status of the arithmetic overflow flag for the *signed* addition (1 if an overflow occurs, 0 if it does not).\n\nProvide these two values as a pair, in the order specified.", "solution": "We model the ALU operation as 8-bit addition modulo $2^{8}$. Let the two given 8-bit operands be interpreted as hexadecimal numbers B4 and 9A. Converting to decimal for ease of arithmetic:\n$$\n\\text{B4} = 11 \\cdot 16 + 4 = 180, \\quad \\text{9A} = 9 \\cdot 16 + 10 = 154.\n$$\nThe arithmetic sum in unbounded integers is\n$$\n180 + 154 = 334.\n$$\nSince the ALU is 8-bit, the stored result is the sum modulo $2^{8}$:\n$$\ns \\equiv 334 \\pmod{2^{8}} \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad s = 334 - 256 = 78.\n$$\nEquivalently in hexadecimal, $\\text{B4} + \\text{9A} = \\text{14E}$, and the 8-bit result is the lower byte $\\text{4E}$, which is $4 \\cdot 16 + 14 = 78$ in decimal. Thus, when interpreted as an unsigned 8-bit integer, the sum is $78$.\n\nFor the signed overflow flag in two’s complement, overflow occurs if and only if the two addends have the same sign and the result has the opposite sign. In 8-bit two’s complement, the sign bit is the most significant bit. The binary forms are\n$$\n\\text{B4} = 10110100_{2}, \\quad \\text{9A} = 10011010_{2}, \\quad \\text{result} = 01001110_{2}.\n$$\nBoth inputs have sign bit $1$ (they are negative), while the 8-bit result has sign bit $0$ (it appears nonnegative). Therefore, an overflow has occurred, and the overflow flag is $1$. This is consistent with interpreting the inputs as signed values $-76$ and $-102$, whose true sum is $-178$, which lies outside the representable 8-bit two’s complement range $[-128, 127]$.\n\nThe required pair is the unsigned 8-bit sum in decimal and the overflow flag bit, in that order.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix}78  1\\end{pmatrix}}$$", "id": "1960891"}, {"introduction": "This final practice moves beyond direct calculation to probe the deeper relationship between arithmetic and logical operations. By seeking a number that satisfies the unusual condition $A + B = A \\oplus B$, you will discover the fundamental role that carry bits play in distinguishing binary addition from a simple bitwise XOR.

Your task is to find the unique non-zero 4-bit number $B$ that not only satisfies the condition $A + B = A \\oplus B$, but also has the largest possible magnitude (absolute value) among all solutions. The addition is performed using 4-bit two's complement arithmetic, meaning any carry-out from the most significant bit position is discarded. The operation $\\oplus$ denotes the bitwise Exclusive OR (XOR). Express your final answer for $B$ as a 4-bit binary string.", "solution": "Let the two 4-bit numbers be $A = a_3a_2a_1a_0$ and $B = b_3b_2b_1b_0$. We are given the condition $A + B = A \\oplus B$.\n\nLet's analyze the relationship between binary addition and the bitwise XOR operation at each bit position $i$. For a full adder at bit position $i$, the sum bit $s_i$ and the carry-out $c_{i+1}$ are given by:\n$$s_i = a_i \\oplus b_i \\oplus c_i$$\n$$c_{i+1} = (a_i \\land b_i) \\lor (a_i \\land c_i) \\lor (b_i \\land c_i)$$\nwhere $c_i$ is the carry-in to the $i$-th position. The carry-in to the least significant bit, $c_0$, is always 0.\n\nThe result of the bitwise XOR operation at position $i$ is $x_i = a_i \\oplus b_i$.\n\nThe problem states that the final sum $S = s_3s_2s_1s_0$ must be identical to the final XOR result $X = x_3x_2x_1x_0$. This means that for each bit position $i \\in \\{0, 1, 2, 3\\}$, we must have $s_i = x_i$.\n\nSubstituting the expressions for $s_i$ and $x_i$:\n$$a_i \\oplus b_i \\oplus c_i = a_i \\oplus b_i$$\n\nFor this equality to hold, the carry-in to each stage, $c_i$, must be 0. Let's verify this for all bit positions.\n- For $i=0$: $s_0 = a_0 \\oplus b_0 \\oplus c_0$. Since $c_0=0$, we get $s_0 = a_0 \\oplus b_0$, which is always equal to $x_0$. This holds regardless of $A$ or $B$.\n- For $i=1$: $s_1 = a_1 \\oplus b_1 \\oplus c_1$. For $s_1 = x_1$, we must have $c_1 = 0$.\n- For $i=2$: $s_2 = a_2 \\oplus b_2 \\oplus c_2$. For $s_2 = x_2$, we must have $c_2 = 0$.\n- For $i=3$: $s_3 = a_3 \\oplus b_3 \\oplus c_3$. For $s_3 = x_3$, we must have $c_3 = 0$.\n\nSo, the condition $A+B=A\\oplus B$ is equivalent to the condition that all internal carries generated during addition must be zero: $c_1=c_2=c_3=0$.\n\nNow we use the carry propagation formula, $c_{i+1} = (a_i \\land b_i) \\lor (c_i \\land (a_i \\oplus b_i))$.\n- We need $c_1=0$. The formula gives $c_1 = (a_0 \\land b_0) \\lor (c_0 \\land (a_0 \\oplus b_0))$. Since $c_0=0$, this simplifies to $c_1 = a_0 \\land b_0$. Thus, we must have $a_0 \\land b_0 = 0$.\n- We need $c_2=0$. The formula gives $c_2 = (a_1 \\land b_1) \\lor (c_1 \\land (a_1 \\oplus b_1))$. Since we require $c_1=0$, this simplifies to $c_2 = a_1 \\land b_1$. Thus, we must have $a_1 \\land b_1 = 0$.\n- By induction, for the condition $c_i=0$ to propagate, we must have $a_{i-1} \\land b_{i-1} = 0$ for all $i=1, 2, 3$. This also applies for the carry-out from the MSB, $c_4$, needing $a_3 \\land b_3 = 0$.\n\nTherefore, the condition $A+B=A\\oplus B$ is fully equivalent to the bitwise condition $A \\land B = 0000_2$.\n\nWe are given $A=0110_2$. Let $B=b_3b_2b_1b_0$. We apply the condition $A \\land B = 0$:\n$$(0110)_2 \\land (b_3b_2b_1b_0)_2 = (0000)_2$$\nThis gives us a set of conditions for the bits of $B$:\n- Bit 0: $0 \\land b_0 = 0$. This is always true, so $b_0$ can be 0 or 1.\n- Bit 1: $1 \\land b_1 = 0$. This implies $b_1$ must be 0.\n- Bit 2: $1 \\land b_2 = 0$. This implies $b_2$ must be 0.\n- Bit 3: $0 \\land b_3 = 0$. This is always true, so $b_3$ can be 0 or 1.\n\nSo, any number $B$ of the form $b_300b_0$ is a valid solution. The problem specifies that $B$ must be non-zero, so $B \\neq 0000_2$. The possible non-zero values for $B$ are:\n1.  $B = 0001_2$ (when $b_3=0, b_0=1$)\n2.  $B = 1000_2$ (when $b_3=1, b_0=0$)\n3.  $B = 1001_2$ (when $b_3=1, b_0=1$)\n\nThe problem asks for the solution with the largest magnitude (absolute value). We need to find the decimal value of each possibility in 4-bit 2's complement representation.\n- For $B = 0001_2$: The sign bit is 0, so it is a positive number. Its decimal value is 1. The magnitude is $|1| = 1$.\n- For $B = 1000_2$: The sign bit is 1, so it is a negative number. Its value is $-2^{3} = -8$. (This is the most negative number in 4-bit 2's complement). The magnitude is $|-8| = 8$.\n- For $B = 1001_2$: The sign bit is 1, so it is a negative number. To find its value, we take the 2's complement: invert the bits ($0110$) and add 1, which gives $0111_2 = 7$. Thus, the value of $1001_2$ is $-7$. The magnitude is $|-7| = 7$.\n\nComparing the magnitudes $\\{1, 8, 7\\}$, the largest magnitude is 8. This corresponds to the binary number $B = 1000_2$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{1000}$$", "id": "1960951"}]}
