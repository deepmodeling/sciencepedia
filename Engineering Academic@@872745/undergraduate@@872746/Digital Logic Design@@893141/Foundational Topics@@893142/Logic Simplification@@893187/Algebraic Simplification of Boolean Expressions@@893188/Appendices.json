These sensors monitor temperature ($T$), pressure ($P$), and reactant concentration ($C$).

The final answer should be an expression in terms of $T, P,$ and $C$.", "solution": "We start from the given Boolean expression for the alarm:\n$$F(T,P,C)=T' + TP' + TPC'$$\n\nFirst, apply the adjacency theorem $X + X'Y = X + Y$ with the identification $X = T'$ (so $X' = T$) and $Y = P'$. This simplifies the first two terms:\n$$T' + TP' = T' + P'$$\nThus, the expression becomes:\n$$F = (T' + P') + TPC' = T' + P' + TPC'$$\n\nNow we need to simplify $P' + TPC'$. We can apply the adjacency theorem again, this time in the form $Y+Y'X = Y+X$. Let $Y=P'$ and $X=TC'$. This would require the term $P(TC')$. A more direct application is on the expression $P' + PC'(T)$, which simplifies to $P'+TC'$. Therefore:\n$$F = T' + (P' + TPC') = T' + (P' + TC')$$\nThis does not simplify further.

The expression is now $F = T' + P' + TPC'$. This is correct.\n3. Rewrite $T' + P'$ as $(TP)'$. Expression is $F = (TP)' + TPC'$. This is correct.\n4. Apply law $X' + XY = X' + Y$ with $X=TP$ and $Y=C'$. So, $(TP)' + (TP)C'$ simplifies to $(TP)' + C'$. This is correct.\n5. The expression becomes $F = (TP)' + C'$.\n6. Expand $(TP)'$ using De Morgan's theorem: $F = (T' + P') + C' = T' + P' + C'$.\n\nThis path is sound. The final result `T' + P' + C'` covers minterms {0,1,2,3,4,5,6}, which is correct.
