This exercise challenges you to translate a functional specification—in this case, a comparison between two input bits—into a pattern of zeros on a 4-variable K-map. By identifying and grouping these zeros, you will derive the minimal POS circuit for a common logic function, bridging the gap between abstract rules and concrete logic.

Otherwise, the output is LOGIC 1.\n\nYour task is to determine the minimal Product-of-Sums (POS) expression for the output function $F(A, B, C, D)$. Use a Karnaugh map for the simplification.
