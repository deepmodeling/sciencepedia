We will use the Quine-McCluskey tabular method.\n\n**Step 1: Group Minterms by Number of 1s**\n\nFirst, we list the minterms in their 4-bit binary representation and group them by the number of '1's in the binary string.\n\n-   Group 0 (0 ones):\n    -   $m_0 = 0000$\n-   Group 1 (1 one):\n    -   $m_1 = 0001$\n    -   $m_2 = 0010$\n-   Group 2 (2 ones):\n    -   $m_5 = 0101$\n    -   $m_6 = 0110$\n-   Group 3 (3 ones):\n    -   $m_7 = 0111$\n    -   $m_{13} = 1101$\n\n**Step 2: Generate Prime Implicants**\n\nNext, we combine minterms from adjacent groups that differ by only one bit. A '-' indicates the position of the differing bit.\n\n-   Combining Group 0 and Group 1:\n    -   $m_0, m_1 \\rightarrow 000-$\n    -   $m_0, m_2 \\rightarrow 00-0$\n-   Combining Group 1 and Group 2:\n    -   $m_1, m_5 \\rightarrow 0-01$\n    -   $m_2, m_6 \\rightarrow 0-10$\n-   Combining Group 2 and Group 3:\n    -   $m_5, m_7 \\rightarrow 01-1$\n    -   $m_5, m_{13} \\rightarrow -101$\n    -   $m_6, m_7 \\rightarrow 011-$\n\nWe then attempt to combine these new terms. For example, to combine $(0,1)$ and $(2,3)$, they must have the same '-' position and differ by one bit elsewhere. In our list, no two terms have the same '-' position, so no further combinations are possible.\n\nThis means all the terms we found are Prime Implicants (PIs). Let's list them and their corresponding algebraic terms:\n-   $PI_1$: $m(0,1) \\rightarrow 000- \\implies \\bar{W}\\bar{X}\\bar{Y}$\n-   $PI_2$: $m(0,2) \\rightarrow 00-0 \\implies \\bar{W}\\bar{X}\\bar{Z}$\n-   $PI_3$: $m(1,5) \\rightarrow 0-01 \\implies \\bar{W}\\bar{Y}Z$\n-   $PI_4$: $m(2,6) \\rightarrow 0-10 \\implies \\bar{W}Y\\bar{Z}$\n-   $PI_5$: $m(5,7) \\rightarrow 01-1 \\implies \\bar{W}XZ$\n-   $PI_6$: $m(5,13) \\rightarrow -101 \\implies X\\bar{Y}Z$\n-   $PI_7$: $m(6,7) \\rightarrow 011- \\implies \\bar{W}XY$\n\n**Step 3: Construct the Prime Implicant Chart**\n\nWe create a chart with minterms as columns and PIs as rows to identify essential prime implicants.\n\n| PI (covers) | $m_0$ | $m_1$ | $m_2$ | $m_5$ | $m_6$ | $m_7$ | $m_{13}$ |\n| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |\n| $PI_1$ (0,1) | X | X | | | | | |\n| $PI_2$ (0,2) | X | | X | | | | |\n| $PI_3$ (1,5) | | X | | X | | | |\n| $PI_4$ (2,6) | | | X | | X | | |\n| $PI_5$ (5,7) | | | | X | | X | |\n| $PI_6$ (5,13)| | | | X | | | X |\n| $PI_7$ (6,7) | | | | | X | X | |\n\n**Step 4: Identify Essential Prime Implicants (EPIs)**\n\nAn EPI is a PI that covers a minterm no other PI covers. We look for columns with only a single 'X'.\n-   The column for minterm $m_{13}$ has only one 'X', corresponding to $PI_6$.\n-   Therefore, $PI_6 (X\\bar{Y}Z)$ is an Essential Prime Implicant.\n\n$PI_6$ covers minterms $m_5$ and $m_{13}$. We add $PI_6$ to our minimal expression and remove these minterms from the list of minterms to be covered. The remaining minterms are $\\{0, 1, 2, 6, 7\\}$.\n\n**Step 5: Create and Analyze the Reduced Prime Implicant Chart**\n\nWe now create a new chart for the remaining minterms and PIs. We do not include any PIs that only covered minterms now handled by the EPIs. All PIs except $PI_6$ are still candidates as they cover at least one of the remaining minterms.\n\n| PI (covers) | $m_0$ | $m_1$ | $m_2$ | $m_6$ | $m_7$ |\n| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |\n| $PI_1$ (0,1) | X | X | | | |\n| $PI_2$ (0,2) | X | | X | | |\n| $PI_3$ (1,5) | | X | | | | (covers $m_1$)\n| $PI_4$ (2,6) | | | X | X | |\n| $PI_5$ (5,7) | | | | | X | (covers $m_7$)\n| $PI_7$ (6,7) | | | | X | X |\n\nIn this reduced chart, there are no columns with a single 'X'. This indicates a cyclic covering problem, which we can solve using Petrick's method or a branching analysis. All candidate PIs ($PI_1, PI_2, PI_3, PI_4, PI_5, PI_7$) are 3-literal terms, so they have the same cost. A minimal solution will be one that uses the fewest PIs.\n\n**Step 6: Solve the Cyclic Covering Problem (Petrick's Method)**\n\nWe write a Boolean expression $P$ which is true when all remaining minterms are covered. Each clause corresponds to a minterm, and the variables in the clause are the PIs that cover it.\n$P = (PI_1+PI_2)(PI_1+PI_3)(PI_2+PI_4)(PI_4+PI_7)(PI_5+PI_7)$\n\nWe expand this expression into a sum-of-products form:\n$P = \\underbrace{(PI_1+PI_2)(PI_1+PI_3)}_{PI_1+PI_2PI_3} \\underbrace{(PI_4+PI_7)(PI_5+PI_7)}_{PI_7+PI_4PI_5}$\n$P = (PI_1+PI_2PI_3)(PI_2+PI_4)(PI_7+PI_4PI_5)$\n\nLet's expand the first two terms:\n$(PI_1+PI_2PI_3)(PI_2+PI_4) = PI_1PI_2+PI_1PI_4+PI_2PI_3PI_2+PI_2PI_3PI_4$\nUsing $A \\cdot A = A$, this simplifies to:\n$= PI_1PI_2+PI_1PI_4+PI_2PI_3+PI_2PI_3PI_4$\nUsing absorption $A+AB=A$, $PI_2PI_3+PI_2PI_3PI_4 = PI_2PI_3$.\nSo, $(PI_1+PI_2PI_3)(PI_2+PI_4) = PI_1PI_2+PI_1PI_4+PI_2PI_3$.\n\nNow multiply by the last term $(PI_7+PI_4PI_5)$:\n$P = (PI_1PI_2+PI_1PI_4+PI_2PI_3)(PI_7+PI_4PI_5)$\n$P = PI_1PI_2PI_7 + PI_1PI_4PI_7 + PI_2PI_3PI_7 + PI_1PI_2PI_4PI_5 + PI_1PI_4PI_4PI_5 + PI_2PI_3PI_4PI_5$\nUsing $A \\cdot A = A$, $PI_1PI_4PI_4PI_5 = PI_1PI_4PI_5$.\n\nSo, $P = PI_1PI_2PI_7 + PI_1PI_4PI_7 + PI_2PI_3PI_7 + PI_1PI_2PI_4PI_5 + PI_1PI_4PI_5 + PI_2PI_3PI_4PI_5$\nApply absorption again:\n$PI_1PI_4PI_5$ absorbs $PI_1PI_2PI_4PI_5$.\nThe final expression is:\n$P = PI_1PI_2PI_7 + PI_1PI_4PI_7 + PI_2PI_3PI_7 + PI_1PI_4PI_5 + PI_2PI_3PI_4PI_5$\n\nEach product term in $P$ represents a valid set of PIs to cover the remaining minterms. We seek the terms with the minimum number of PIs.\n-   $PI_1PI_2PI_7$ (3 PIs)\n-   $PI_1PI_4PI_7$ (3 PIs)\n-   $PI_2PI_3PI_7$ (3 PIs)\n-   $PI_1PI_4PI_5$ (3 PIs)\n-   $PI_2PI_3PI_4PI_5$ (4 PIs)\n\nThe minimal solutions for the reduced problem are the four sets with 3 PIs each.\n\n**Step 7: Final Count of Minimal Expressions**\n\nEach of these four sets, when combined with the essential prime implicant $PI_6$, forms a distinct minimal SOP expression for the original function $F$.\nThe four minimal solutions are:\n1.  $F = PI_6 + PI_1 + PI_2 + PI_7 = X\\bar{Y}Z + \\bar{W}\\bar{X}\\bar{Y} + \\bar{W}\\bar{X}\\bar{Z} + \\bar{W}XY$\n2.  $F = PI_6 + PI_1 + PI_4 + PI_7 = X\\bar{Y}Z + \\bar{W}\\bar{X}\\bar{Y} + \\bar{W}Y\\bar{Z} + \\bar{W}XY$\n3.  $F = PI_6 + PI_2 + PI_3 + PI_7 = X\\bar{Y}Z + \\bar{W}\\bar{X}\\bar{Z} + \\bar{W}\\bar{Y}Z + \\bar{W}XY$\n4.  $F = PI_6 + PI_1 + PI_4 + PI_5 = X\\bar{Y}Z + \\bar{W}\\bar{X}\\bar{Y} + \\bar{W}Y\\bar{Z} + \\bar{W}XZ$\n\nAll these expressions have 1 EPI and 3 other PIs, for a total of 4 PIs. Since all PIs are 3-literal terms, all four expressions have the same minimal literal count of $4 \\times 3 = 12$.\n\nTherefore, there are 4 distinct minimal SOP expressions for the function.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{4}$$", "id": "1970777"}]}
