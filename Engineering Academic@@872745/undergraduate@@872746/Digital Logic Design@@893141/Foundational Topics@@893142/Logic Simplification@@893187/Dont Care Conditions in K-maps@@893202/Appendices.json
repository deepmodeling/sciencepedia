The state of the thruster's pre-ignition chamber is monitored by a 4-bit digital word, represented by the variables $A, B, C, D$, where $A$ is the Most Significant Bit (MSB) and $D$ is the Least Significant Bit (LSB).\n\nThe thruster is designed to be fired only when the chamber is in one specific, stable state. A logic circuit outputs a \"Safe-to-Fire\" signal, $F$, which must be HIGH (logic 1) if and only if the state is $ABCD = 1101$.\n\nFurthermore, engineering analysis has identified a critically unstable state, $ABCD = 1111$. To guarantee safety, the \"Safe-to-Fire\" signal $F$ must be LOW (logic 0) for this specific state.\n\nFor all other 14 possible 4-bit states, the system is in a transient phase where firing is not initiated. As the \"Safe-to-Fire\" signal's value is irrelevant during these transient states, they can be treated as don't-care conditions in the logic design.\n\nDetermine the minimal Sum-of-Products (SOP) expression for the \"Safe-to-Fire\" signal $F$ in terms of the input variables $A, B, C, and D$.", "solution": "The problem asks for the minimal Sum-of-Products (SOP) expression for a 4-input logic function $F(A, B, C, D)$. We can solve this using a Karnaugh map (K-map).\n\nFirst, let's summarize the function's output based on the problem description. The inputs are $A, B, C, D$, where $A$ is the MSB. We can represent the 4-bit input as a decimal minterm number.\n\n1.  The output $F$ is 1 for the input state $ABCD = 1101$. This corresponds to the decimal value $1 \\cdot 2^3 + 1 \\cdot 2^2 + 0 \\cdot 2^1 + 1 \\cdot 2^0 = 8 + 4 + 0 + 1 = 13$. So, $F=1$ for minterm $m_{13}$.\n\n2.  The output $F$ is 0 for the input state $ABCD = 1111$. This corresponds to the decimal value $1 \\cdot 2^3 + 1 \\cdot 2^2 + 1 \\cdot 2^1 + 1 \\cdot 2^0 = 8 + 4 + 2 + 1 = 15$. So, $F=0$ for minterm $m_{15}$.\n\n3.  For all other 14 states, the output is a don't-care, denoted by $X$.\n\nNow, we can construct a 4-variable K-map. We'll use $AB$ to label the rows and $CD$ to label the columns, following Gray code ordering (00, 01, 11, 10).\n\nThe K-map is populated as follows:\n-   Place a '1' in the cell corresponding to minterm $m_{13}$ (row $AB=11$, column $CD=01$).\n-   Place a '0' in the cell corresponding to minterm $m_{15}$ (row $AB=11$, column $CD=11$).\n-   Place 'X's in all other 14 cells.\n\nThe resulting K-map is:\n$$\n\\begin{array}{c|c|c|c|c|}\n\\multicolumn{1}{c}{} & \\multicolumn{4}{c}{CD} \\\\\n\\cline{3-5}\n\\multicolumn{1}{c}{AB} & 00 & 01 & 11 & 10 \\\\\n\\cline{2-5}\n00 & X & X & X & X \\\\\n\\cline{2-5}\n01 & X & X & X & X \\\\\n\\cline{2-5}\n11 & X & 1 & 0 & X \\\\\n\\cline{2-5}\n10 & X & X & X & X \\\\\n\\cline{2-5}\n\\end{array}\n$$\n\nOur goal is to find the largest possible group (or groups) of adjacent cells that cover all the '1's on the map. We can use the 'X's to make the group larger, but we must not include any '0's. In this case, we only need to cover the single '1' at cell $m_{13}$.\n\nLet's examine possible groupings for the '1' at $m_{13}$:\n-   **Group of 16:** Not possible as it would have to include the '0' at $m_{15}$.\n-   **Groups of 8:** We can form a group of 8 if eight adjacent cells contain the '1' and seven 'X's, and no '0's.\n    -   Consider the block of 8 cells where the variable $C$ is 0. These are the two columns corresponding to $CD=00$ and $CD=01$. This group consists of minterms $\\{m_0, m_1, m_4, m_5, m_8, m_9, m_{12}, m_{13}\\}$. This group contains our '1' (at $m_{13}$) and seven 'X's. It does not contain the '0' at $m_{15}$. Therefore, this is a valid group. The variable that is constant in this group is $C=0$, so the term for this group is $\\overline{C}$.\n    -   Consider the block where $A=1$ (rows $AB=10, 11$). This contains $\\{m_8, m_9, m_{11}, m_{10}, m_{12}, m_{13}, m_{15}, m_{14}\\}$. This group is invalid because it includes the '0' at $m_{15}$.\n    -   Other possible groups of 8 (for $B=1$ or $D=1$) will also include the cell $m_{15}$ and are thus invalid.\n\n-   **Groups of 4 or 2:** We could form smaller groups, for example, a group of 4 covering $\\{m_1, m_5, m_9, m_{13}\\}$, which gives the term $\\overline{C}D$. However, the goal is to find the minimal SOP expression, which requires finding the largest possible prime implicants. The group of 8 we found (giving $\\overline{C}$) is larger than any possible group of 4 or 2.\n\nSince the single '1' on the map is covered by the prime implicant $\\overline{C}$, and this is the largest possible grouping, it is the essential prime implicant that forms the minimal SOP expression.\n\nThus, the minimal SOP expression for the \"Safe-to-Fire\" signal is $F(A, B, C, D) = \\overline{C}$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\overline{C}}$$", "id": "1930513"}, {"introduction": "Next, we examine a common scenario in digital design where system-level constraints render a large portion of possible inputs invalid.
