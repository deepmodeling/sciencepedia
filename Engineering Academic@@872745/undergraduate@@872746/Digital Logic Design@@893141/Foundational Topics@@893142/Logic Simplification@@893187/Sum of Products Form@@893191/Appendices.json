The Sum of Products is a standard representation of a logical expression where product terms (inputs connected by AND operations) are connected by sum operations (OR operations).

We perform a case analysis on $W_1$ because of its larger weight.\n\n1) Case $W_{1}=1$: The sum is $S = 2 + W_{2} + W_{3} + W_{4}$. The condition $S \\ge 3$ becomes $W_{2} + W_{3} + W_{4} \\ge 1$. This is true if at least one of $W_2, W_3,$ or $W_4$ is 1. This part of the function is represented by the Boolean expression $W_{1}(W_{2} + W_{3} + W_{4})$, which expands to the SOP form $W_{1}W_{2} + W_{1}W_{3} + W_{1}W_{4}$.\n\n2) Case $W_{1}=0$: The sum is $S = W_{2} + W_{3} + W_{4}$.

Applying this theorem is equivalent to adding redundant terms that can help simplify the expression through other rules.
