This exercise demonstrates that the idealized rules of digital logic have important physical limitations.", "problem": "In digital logic design, a basic bistable memory element can be constructed from two cross-coupled NOR gates. This circuit is known as a Set-Reset (SR) latch. Let the two inputs be S (Set) and R (Reset), and the two outputs be Q and $\\overline{Q}$. The top NOR gate receives inputs R and $\\overline{Q}$ and produces the output Q. The bottom NOR gate receives inputs S and Q and produces the output $\\overline{Q}$. The logical behavior of a two-input NOR gate is such that its output is 1 if and only if both of its inputs are 0; otherwise, its output is 0.\n\nConsider an SR latch that is initially stable in the RESET state, where S=0 and R=1. Following this, the inputs are changed to the normally forbidden state where S=1 and R=1 for a brief period. Finally, both inputs are simultaneously de-asserted, returning to the quiescent state of S=0 and R=0.\n\nWhich of the following statements best describes the final, stable state of the outputs Q and $\\overline{Q}$ after this sequence of operations?\n\nA. The latch will reliably return to its initial RESET state (Q=0, $\\overline{Q}$=1).\n\nB. The latch will reliably transition to the SET state (Q=1, $\\overline{Q}$=0).\n\nC. The latch enters a state where both outputs Q and $\\overline{Q}$ are permanently held at 1.\n\nD. The outputs Q and $\\overline{Q}$ will oscillate indefinitely between 0 and 1, never reaching a stable state.\n\nE. The final state is indeterminate; the latch will settle into either the SET or RESET state based on minute, unpredictable differences in gate propagation delays.", "solution": "Let the two cross-coupled NOR equations be\n$$Q=\\overline{R+\\overline{Q}},\\qquad \\overline{Q}=\\overline{S+Q},$$\nwhere $+$ denotes logical OR and the overline denotes logical NOT.\n\nInitial condition: $S=0$, $R=1$. Then\n$$Q=\\overline{1+\\overline{Q}}=0,$$\nand with $Q=0$,\n$$\\overline{Q}=\\overline{0+0}=1.$$\nThus the latch is in RESET with $(Q,\\overline{Q})=(0,1)$.\n\nForbidden input condition: $S=1$, $R=1$.

The equilibrium equations become\n$$Q=\\overline{0+\\overline{Q}}=\\overline{\\overline{Q}},\\qquad \\overline{Q}=\\overline{0+Q}=\\overline{Q}.$$\nChecking possible steady states:\n- If $Q=1$, then $\\overline{Q}=\\overline{0+1}=0$ and $Q=\\overline{0+0}=1$ are consistent, giving the SET state.\n- If $Q=0$, then $\\overline{Q}=\\overline{0+0}=1$ and $Q=\\overline{0+1}=0$ are consistent, giving the RESET state.\n- The states $(Q,\\overline{Q})=(0,0)$ and $(1,1)$ are inconsistent with the equations for $S=R=0$.\n\nImmediately after $S$ and $R$ fall to $0$, both NOR gates momentarily see both their inputs at $0$ (since both outputs were $0$), so each gate tends to drive its output to $1$. Due to the cross-coupling, both outputs cannot remain $1$; an infinitesimal asymmetry in propagation delays or noise causes one output to reach $1$ first, which then forces the other to $0$. Because the prior state was erased during $S=R=1$, there is no deterministic bias. Therefore, the latch settles into either SET or RESET unpredictably, determined by minute, uncontrollable timing differences.\n\nThus, the final stable state is indeterminate and depends on propagation-delay skews, matching option E.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{E}$$", "id": "1915637"}, {"introduction": "While basic latches are powerful, synchronous systems require state changes to happen at precise moments, synchronized by a clock signal.
