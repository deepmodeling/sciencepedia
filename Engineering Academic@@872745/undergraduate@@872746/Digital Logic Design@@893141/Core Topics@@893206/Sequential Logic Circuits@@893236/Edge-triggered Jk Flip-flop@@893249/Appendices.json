The behavior of the flip-flop is described by the characteristic equation $Q_{next} = J\\overline{Q} + \\overline{K}Q$. The inputs are defined by the connections $J = \\overline{Q}$ and $K = Q$.\n\nTo determine the state diagram, we must analyze the next state, $Q_{next}$, for each possible current state, $Q$. There are two possible current states: $Q=0$ and $Q=1$.\n\n**Case 1: Current state is $Q=0$.**\nIf the current state is $Q=0$, its inversion is $\\overline{Q}=1$.\nWe can determine the values of the inputs $J$ and $K$ based on the given connections:\n$J = \\overline{Q} = 1$\n$K = Q = 0$\nNow, we substitute these values of $J$, $K$, and $Q$ into the characteristic equation to find the next state, $Q_{next}$:\n$Q_{next} = J\\overline{Q} + \\overline{K}Q$\n$Q_{next} = (1)(\\overline{0}) + (\\overline{0})(0)$\n$Q_{next} = (1)(1) + (1)(0)$\n$Q_{next} = 1 + 0$\n$Q_{next} = 1$\nThus, when the current state is 0, the state after the next active clock edge will be 1. This corresponds to a state transition from 0 to 1.\n\n**Case 2: Current state is $Q=1$.**\nIf the current state is $Q=1$, its inversion is $\\overline{Q}=0$.\nWe determine the values of the inputs $J$ and $K$:\n$J = \\overline{Q} = 0$\n$K = Q = 1$\nNext, we substitute these values into the characteristic equation:\n$Q_{next} = J\\overline{Q} + \\overline{K}Q$\n$Q_{next} = (0)(\\overline{1}) + (\\overline{1})(1)$\n$Q_{next} = (0)(0) + (0)(1)$\n$Q_{next} = 0 + 0$\n$Q_{next} = 0$\nThus, when the current state is 1, the state after the next active clock edge will be 0. This corresponds to a state transition from 1 to 0.\n\n**Summary and State Diagram:**\nWe can summarize these findings in a state table:\n| Current State (Q) | J Input ($=\\overline{Q}$) | K Input ($=Q$) | Next State (Q_next) |\n|:-----------------:|:----------------------:|:--------------:|:-------------------:|\n| 0                 | 1                      | 0              | 1                   |\n| 1                 | 0                      | 1              | 0                   |\n\nThe state diagram derived from this table shows a transition from state 0 to state 1, and a transition from state 1 back to state 0. This means the output $Q$ changes its value on every positive clock edge. This behavior is known as \"toggling\".\n\nComparing this behavior to the given options:\n- Option A describes a system that toggles its state (0 to 1, and 1 to 0). This matches our analysis.\n- Option B describes a system that always transitions to 1 (0 to 1, and 1 to 1). This is incorrect.\n- Option C describes a system that always transitions to 0 (0 to 0, and 1 to 0). This is incorrect.\n- Option D describes a system that holds its state (0 to 0, and 1 to 1).
