This equation expresses the next state of the flip-flop, denoted as $Q(t+1)$, as a Boolean function of its current state, $Q(t)$, and its control inputs.\n\nConsider a standard Set-Reset (SR) flip-flop. Its behavior is defined by two inputs, $S$ (Set) and $R$ (Reset), and is governed by the following rules:\n- **Set:** When $S=1$ and $R=0$, the next state is forced to 1, so $Q(t+1) = 1$.\n- **Reset:** When $S=0$ and $R=1$, the next state is forced to 0, so $Q(t+1) = 0$.\n- **Hold:** When $S=0$ and $R=0$, the flip-flop maintains its current state, so $Q(t+1) = Q(t)$.\nThe input condition $S=1, R=1$ is considered invalid and is not used in normal operation.
