The behavior of this latch is defined as follows:\n- When the gate input G is HIGH (logic 1), the latch is in \"transparent\" mode, and the output Q follows the state of the data input D.\n- When the gate input G is LOW (logic 0), the latch is in \"opaque\" mode, and the output Q holds its last value, ignoring any changes at the D input.\n\nConsider a specific implementation of this latch that has a uniform propagation delay, $t_{pd} = 2 \\text{ ns}$. This means that any change at the inputs (D or G) that results in a change at the output Q will see that change reflected at Q only after a delay of $t_{pd}$.\n\nThe inputs D and G are subjected to a sequence of transitions over time, starting from $t=0$.

This type of fault analysis is a crucial skill for hardware debugging, testing, and robust design, forcing you to connect the latch's high-level function to its gate-level implementation [@problem_id:1968091].", "problem": "A gated D latch is constructed using NAND gates as follows. The primary inputs are a data line `D` and an enable line `E`. An inverter, built from a NAND gate with its inputs tied together, generates `D_bar = NOT(D)`. The outputs of the latch are `Q` and `Q_bar`. The internal structure consists of two main parts:\n1.  A pair of input steering NAND gates: The first gate computes `S_bar = NAND(D, E)`, and the second computes `R_bar = NAND(D_bar, E)`.\n2.  A cross-coupled Set-Reset (SR) latch core: This is made of two NAND gates where `Q = NAND(S_bar, Q_bar)` and `Q_bar = NAND(R_bar, Q)`.\n\nConsider a scenario where a manufacturing defect causes a specific input pin to be permanently stuck-at-1 (tied to logic HIGH).
