Let the register bits be denoted by $R_7, R_6, \\dots, R_0$, where the serial data is input to $R_7$ and the serial data is output from $R_0$. The system operates based on a master clock, `CLK_M`, which has a period of $T$.\n\nThe register's operation is governed by a control signal, `LOAD_EN`, and two derived clocks, `CLK_L` and `CLK_S`.\n- When `LOAD_EN` is high (logical '1'), the register is in \"Load Mode\". It serially loads data from an input line `DATA_IN` using the clock `CLK_L`.\n- When `LOAD_EN` is low (logical '0'), the register is in \"Shift Mode\". It serially shifts its contents out to the `DATA_OUT` line using the clock `CLK_S`. During Shift Mode, the serial input to $R_7$ is held at a constant logical '0'.\n\nThe clocks are defined as follows:\n- `CLK_L` is identical to `CLK_M`. Its rising edges occur at $t = T, 2T, 3T, \\dots$.\n- `CLK_S` is a clock with a period of $2T$.

The data on the `DATA_IN` line is stable before each rising edge of `CLK_L`.\n\nThe system remains in Load Mode for exactly 8 cycles of `CLK_L`. Immediately after the 8th rising edge of `CLK_L`, the `LOAD_EN` signal transitions to low and remains low thereafter, putting the system into Shift Mode.
