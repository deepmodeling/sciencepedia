An essential characteristic of this circuit is its operational constraint: for any valid state, exactly one of the four input lines is at a high logic level ('1'), while the other three are at a low logic level ('0'). The circuit's function is to produce a 2-bit binary number on its outputs, $Y_1Y_0$, that corresponds to the numerical index of the active input line. In this output, $Y_1$ serves as the most significant bit and $Y_0$ as the least significant bit. For instance, if input $I_2$ is the active line (i.e., $I_2 = 1$), the resulting binary output is '10' (so $Y_1=1$ and $Y_0=0$).\n\nDetermine the fully simplified Boolean expression for the least significant output bit, $Y_0$, as a function of the four inputs.
