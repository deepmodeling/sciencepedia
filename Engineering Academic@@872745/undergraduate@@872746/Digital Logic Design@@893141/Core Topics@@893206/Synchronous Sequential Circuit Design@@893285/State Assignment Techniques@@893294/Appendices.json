The lead engineer has decided to use a 3-bit binary encoding scheme for the state representation.\n\nYour task is to determine the total number of possible, unique state assignments. An assignment is considered unique if it differs from another by having at least one state assigned to a different binary code.

This practice asks you to apply this key heuristic, which aims to simplify logic by assigning adjacent binary codes (those with a Hamming distance of 1) to states that transition between each other frequently. This exercise will bridge the gap between theory and application, allowing you to evaluate competing assignments and select the one that best optimizes a critical path in a circuit.", "problem": "A digital design engineer is developing a controller for a specialized robotic arm. The controller's behavior is modeled as a Finite State Machine (FSM) with three distinct operational states: `IDLE`, `GRASP`, and `MOVE`. Based on operational analysis, the transition from the `GRASP` state to the `MOVE` state occurs with the highest frequency and is therefore a critical path for logic optimization.\n\nTo implement the FSM, two state variables, $Q_1$ and $Q_0$, are used. The engineer is evaluating two different binary state assignments to determine which one is more optimal. An optimal assignment, in this context, is one that satisfies the adjacency principle for the most frequent transition (`GRASP` to `MOVE`), as this generally leads to simpler combinational logic for the next-state decoder.\n\nThe two proposed state assignments are as follows:\n\n**Assignment A:**\n- `IDLE`:  $Q_1Q_0 = 00$\n- `GRASP`: $Q_1Q_0 = 10$\n- `MOVE`:  $Q_1Q_0 = 11$\n\n**Assignment B:**\n- `IDLE`:  $Q_1Q_0 = 00$\n- `GRASP`: $Q_1Q_0 = 01$\n- `MOVE`:  $Q_1Q_0 = 10$\n\nGiven the goal of optimizing the `GRASP` to `MOVE` transition, which of the following statements correctly evaluates the two assignments based on the adjacency principle?\n\nA.
