This is a classic application where a Mealy machine is designed to recognize a specific pattern in an input stream and signal its detection with an output. This problem [@problem_id:1968914] illustrates how states are strategically defined to act as a memory, tracking progress towards finding the target sequence, which is a cornerstone of digital logic design.", "problem": "A digital controller is being designed to monitor a serial binary data stream. The controller must be implemented as a Mealy finite-state machine. A Mealy machine is a type of finite-state machine where the output is a function of both the present state and the current input.\n\nThe machine has a single binary input, `X`, and a single binary output, `Z`. The machine's function is to detect a specific sequence of inputs. The output `Z` must be '1' for exactly one clock cycle, occurring at the same time as the final input of the target sequence. The target sequence is three consecutive '1's (`111`).\n\nA crucial design constraint is that a detected sequence cannot overlap with the beginning of a new one. For example, if the input stream is `111111`, the machine should detect the first `111` sequence and output a `1`, and then detect the second `111` sequence and output another `1`. The output sequence for this input would be `001001`. After a `111` sequence is detected and the output `Z` is asserted to `1`, the machine must fully reset its count and begin searching for a new, entirely separate sequence of three `1`s.\n\nThe states of the minimal Mealy machine required for this task can be defined based on the history of consecutive '1's received:\n- `S_0`: The initial or 'reset' state. No consecutive '1's have been seen, or the sequence was just broken by an input of '0'.\n- `S_1`: The state indicating that the last input was the first '1' in a potential sequence (i.e., the input history ends in `...01`).\n- `S_2`: The state indicating that the last two inputs were consecutive '1's (i.e., the input history ends in `...011`).\n\nGiven that the machine is currently in state `S_2`, determine the next state and the corresponding output `Z` if the next input `X` is '1'.\n\nA) Next State: `S_0`, Output: `0`\n\nB) Next State: `S_1`, Output: `1`\n\nC) Next State: `S_2`, Output: `1`\n\nD) Next State: `S_0`, Output: `1`\n\nE) Next State: `S_2`, Output: `0`", "solution": "A Mealy machine is defined by a next-state function $\\delta(\\text{state},X)$ and an output function $\\lambda(\\text{state},X)$, both depending on the present state and current input $X \\in \\{0,1\\}$.\n\nBy definition of the states:\n- $S_{2}$ means the last two inputs were consecutive ones. If the next input is $X=1$, then the last three inputs are $111$.\n- The specification requires that upon detecting $111$, the output $Z$ must be $1$ exactly on the clock cycle of the third $1$. In a Mealy machine, this means $\\lambda(S_{2},1)=1$.\n- The non-overlap constraint requires a full reset after detection, so the next state must be $S_{0}$, i.e., $\\delta(S_{2},1)=S_{0}$.\n\nTherefore, for input $X=1$ when in state $S_{2}$, the transition is to $S_{0}$ with output $Z=1$, which matches option D.\n\nThis also reproduces the example trace for input $111111$: starting at $S_{0}$, the third $1$ causes $(S_{2},1)\\to(S_{0},Z=1)$, then the next three $1$s repeat the same, yielding output $001001$ as specified.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "1968914"}]}
