In any real-world digital circuit, a change at an input doesn't instantaneously appear at the output.

This is a cornerstone of timing analysis, essential for determining the maximum operating speed of a circuit.", "problem": "In the design of a specialized high-speed data path arbiter, a critical control signal $F$ is generated based on four inputs: $A$, $B$, $C$, and $D$. The logical relationship is defined by the Boolean expression $F = (A+B) \\cdot (C+D)$. The circuit is implemented using a network of standard two-input logic gates. Based on the technology library being used, the propagation delay for any two-input OR gate is $t_{p,\\text{OR}} = 1.35$ nanoseconds (ns), and the propagation delay for any two-input AND gate is $t_{p,\\text{AND}} = 0.95$ ns.\n\nFor a correct timing analysis, it is essential to determine the time it takes for a change in an input to affect the final output.

For a change at input $B$ to affect $F$, the path is\n$$B \\rightarrow X=A+B \\rightarrow F=X\\cdot Y.$$\nThis path traverses one OR gate and then one AND gate.\n\nFor the change at $B$ to be reflected at $F$, the other input of the AND gate must be at the non-controlling value. Since the controlling value for AND is $0$, we require $Y=C+D=1$ held stable during the transition; this sensitizes the path so that changes in $X$ propagate to $F$.\n\nTherefore, the total propagation delay from $B$ to $F$ is the sum of the propagation delays of the OR gate generating $X$ and the AND gate generating $F$:\n$$t_{B\\to F}=t_{p,\\text{OR}}+t_{p,\\text{AND}}.$$\nSubstituting the given values,\n$$t_{B\\to F}=1.35+0.95=2.30.$$\nThe required unit is nanoseconds, so the numerical value is $2.30$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{2.30}$$", "id": "1939407"}, {"introduction": "Building upon the basic concept of delay, it's crucial to recognize that propagation delays are not always uniform.
