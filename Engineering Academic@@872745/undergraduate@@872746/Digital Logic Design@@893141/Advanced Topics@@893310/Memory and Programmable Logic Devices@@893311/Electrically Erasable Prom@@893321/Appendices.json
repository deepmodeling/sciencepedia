Because the address was changed only $12 \\text{ ns}$ before the falling edge, the decoder may not have fully switched to 0xABCD when $\\overline{WE}$ went low. In practice, with this violation, the device can select the previously addressed location (0xABCC) when the write is initiated.\n- All other timing (data setup to the rising edge, address hold after the rising edge, and pulse width) is satisfied, so the write operation proceeds and completes reliably once initiated.\n\nTherefore, the byte 0x55 is written to the old address 0xABCC, while the intended address 0xABCD remains unchanged at its prior value 0xFF.\n\nHence, after the faulty write, the stored data are (0x55 at 0xABCC, 0xFF at 0xABCD), which corresponds to option C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1932077"}]}
