The PAL has 3 inputs, denoted as $A, B, C$, and 2 outputs, denoted as $F_1, F_2$.\n\nThe internal architecture of this PAL is as follows:\n-   The inputs to the programmable AND array are provided by six input lines, $L_1, L_2, L_3, L_4, L_5, L_6$, which correspond to $\\bar{A}, A, \\bar{B}, B, \\bar{C}, C$, respectively.\n-   The programmable AND array consists of four AND gates, which generate four product terms: $P_1, P_2, P_3, P_4$. Each AND gate can be connected to any of the six input lines via fuses. A fuse is either `intact` (connection exists) or `blown` (connection is broken). To form a product term, only the fuses corresponding to the variables in that term remain intact. If a product term consists of a single variable, only the fuse for that variable's input line is left intact for the corresponding AND gate.\n-   The OR array is fixed. The outputs are defined by hardwired connections to the product terms as follows:\n    -   $F_1 = P_1 + P_2$\n    -   $F_2 = P_3 + P_4$\n\nThe desired functionality is given by the following Boolean expressions:\n-   $F_1(A, B, C) = \\bar{A}B + C$\n-   $F_2(A, B, C) = A\\bar{B} + BC$\n\nYou are tasked with determining the correct configuration of fuses that must remain intact to realize these functions. All other fuses are assumed to be blown. A set of intact fuses for a single product term is denoted by a set of pairs `(Product Term, Input Line)`.
