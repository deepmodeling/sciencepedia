The Espresso heuristic logic minimization algorithm is applied to this cover. During the EXPAND phase of the algorithm, the implicant $p = A'B'C$ is selected for expansion. The EXPAND procedure attempts to create a larger implicant (a prime implicant) by removing as many literals as possible from $p$, one at a time, while ensuring the resulting product term remains a valid implicant of the function.

We apply the EXPAND phase to $p=A'B'C$.\n\nFirst, determine the minterms covered by $p$: since $A=0$, $B=0$, $C=1$, we have that $p$ covers exactly minterm $1$. To expand, remove literals one at a time, checking that the resulting product covers only minterms in $F_{ON}\\cup F_{DC}$.\n\n- Remove $A'$: obtain $B'C$. This covers minterms with $B=0$, $C=1$, i.e., $\\{1,5\\}$. Since $\\{1,5\\}\\subseteq\\{1,4,5,7\\}$, this is a valid implicant.\n\n- Remove $B'$: obtain $A'C$.

Two minterms are adjacent if they differ in exactly one variable. For parity, flipping any single variable toggles the parity. Therefore, for any ON-set minterm (odd parity), all of its Hamming-distance-1 neighbors lie in the OFF-set (even parity). Consequently, any attempt to expand a minterm by dropping one literal would necessarily include its adjacent OFF-set minterm, which is not allowed. Hence no minterm can be expanded; each initial minterm is already a prime implicant.\n\nIn IRREDUNDANT_COVER, an implicant is essential if it is the only implicant covering some ON minterm. Here, each ON minterm is covered only by its identical cube in the initial SOP; no other cube covers it, so each cube is essential and cannot be removed without leaving that minterm uncovered. Therefore, the cover cannot be reduced below eight terms. The REDUCE operation does not alter the cover because there is no overlap to exploit.\n\nThus, the final cover contains 8 product terms, and the fundamental reason EXPAND does not change the cover is that every ON-set minterm is adjacent only to OFF-set minterms, so any expansion would illegally cover the OFF-set.
