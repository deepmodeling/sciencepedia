Let's check for stability by calculating the next state $(Y_1, Y_2)$:\n$$Y_1 = (1)(0) + (0)(0) = 0$$\n$$Y_2 = (0)(1) + (1)(0) = 0$$\nSince $(Y_1, Y_2) = (0, 0)$, which is equal to the present state, the initial configuration is stable.\n\n**Step 2: First Input Change**\nThe input $x_1$ changes from 0 to 1, so the new input is $(x_1, x_2) = (1, 0)$. The present state is still $(y_1, y_2) = (0, 0)$. We calculate the next state:\n$$Y_1 = (0)(0) + (0)(0) = 0$$\n$$Y_2 = (1)(1) + (1)(0) = 1$$\nThe next state is $(Y_1, Y_2) = (0, 1)$. Since this is different from the present state, the circuit is unstable and transitions to the state $(0, 1)$. Now we check if $(0, 1)$ is stable for the input $(1, 0)$. Present state is $(y_1, y_2) = (0, 1)$:\n$$Y_1 = (0)(1) + (0)(0) = 0$$\n$$Y_2 = (1)(1) + (1)(1) = 1$$\nThe next state is $(Y_1, Y_2) = (0, 1)$, which is the same as the present state. So, the circuit stabilizes at $(0, 1)$.\n\n**Step 3: Second Input Change**\nThe input $x_1$ changes back from 1 to 0, so the input is again $(x_1, x_2) = (0, 0)$. The circuit is starting from its new stable state, $(y_1, y_2) = (0, 1)$.

The behavior of the circuit is described by a single external input `x` and two internal state variables, `y_1` and `y_2`. The next-state equations for the circuit, which dictate the future state `(Y_1, Y_2)` based on the input `x` and the present state `(y_1, y_2)`, are given by:\n\n$Y_1 = x$\n$Y_2 = x$\n\nInitially, the system is in a long-held stable state where the input `x` is `0` and the state variables `(y_1, y_2)` are `(0, 0)`. At time `t_0`, the input `x` instantaneously changes from `0` to `1` and remains `1`.\n\nDue to physical variations in the circuit wiring and logic gates, the propagation delay for the state variable `y_1` is not necessarily equal to that of `y_2`. This means that when both `y_1` and `y_2` are required to change, one might change before the other.\n\nIdentify the two possible sequences of present states `(y_1, y_2)` that the circuit can transition through as it moves from its initial state to its new final stable state, considering the different possible propagation delays.\n\nA.

We can verify this using the next-state equations.\nFor `x = 0`, the equations become:\n$Y_1 = 0$\n$Y_2 = 0$\nSince the next state `(Y_1, Y_2) = (0, 0)` is the same as the present state `(y_1, y_2) = (0, 0)`, the state is indeed stable.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Effect of the Input Change**\nAt time `t_0`, the input `x` changes from `0` to `1`. The circuit is still in the present state `(y_1, y_2) = (0, 0)`. The total state of the system is `(x, y_1, y_2) = (1, 0, 0)`.\nWe calculate the next state `(Y_1, Y_2)` using the new input `x = 1`:\n$Y_1 = 1$\n$Y_2 = 1$\nThe next state is `(Y_1, Y_2) = (1, 1)`.\n\n**Step 3: Identify the Race Condition**\nThe present state is `(y_1, y_2) = (0, 0)` and the next state is `(Y_1, Y_2) = (1, 1)`. Since both state variables must change (`y_1: 0 \\to 1` and `y_2: 0 \\to 1`), a race condition exists. We must analyze the two possible outcomes based on which variable changes first.\n\n**Step 4: Trace Path 1 (Assume `y_1` changes first)**\nIf `y_1` has a shorter propagation delay, it will change from `0` to `1` before `y_2` does.\n- The state `(y_1, y_2)` transitions from `(0, 0)` to an intermediate state `(1, 0)`.\n- Now, the circuit is in the present state `(y_1, y_2) = (1, 0)` with the input `x = 1`. The total state is `(x, y_1, y_2) = (1, 1, 0)`. We must calculate the next state from this intermediate point.\n- Using the next-state equations with `x = 1`:\n  $Y_1 = 1$\n  $Y_2 = 1$\n- The next state is `(Y_1, Y_2) = (1, 1)`. The present state is `(1, 0)`. The circuit will now transition from `(1, 0)` to `(1, 1)`. This is a stable transition as only `y_2` changes.\n- Once the circuit reaches `(y_1, y_2) = (1, 1)` with `x=1`, let's check for stability. The next state is `(Y_1, Y_2)=(1, 1)`, which is the same as the present state. So, `(1, 1)` is the final stable state.\n\nThe sequence of states for Path 1 is: `(0, 0) \\to (1, 0) \\to (1, 1)`.\n\n**Step 5: Trace Path 2 (Assume `y_2` changes first)**\nIf `y_2` has a shorter propagation delay, it will change from `0` to `1` before `y_1` does.\n- The state `(y_1, y_2)` transitions from `(0, 0)` to an intermediate state `(0, 1)`.\n- Now, the circuit is in the present state `(y_1, y_2) = (0, 1)` with the input `x = 1`. The total state is `(x, y_1, y_2) = (1, 0, 1)`. We calculate the next state from this point.\n- Using the next-state equations with `x = 1`:\n  $Y_1 = 1$\n  $Y_2 = 1$\n- The next state is `(Y_1, Y_2) = (1, 1)`. The present state is `(0, 1)`. The circuit will now transition from `(0, 1)` to `(1, 1)`. This is a stable transition as only `y_1` changes.\n- The circuit reaches `(y_1, y_2) = (1, 1)`, which we already determined is a stable state for `x = 1`.\n\nThe sequence of states for Path 2 is: `(0, 0) \\to (0, 1) \\to (1, 1)`.\n\n**Step 6: Conclusion**\n- Both possible paths, arising from the different propagation delays, lead to the same final stable state `(1, 1)`. This type of race is known as a non-critical race.\n- The two possible sequences of states are:\n  - Path 1: `(0,0) -> (1,0) -> (1,1)`\n  - Path 2: `(0,0) -> (0,1) -> (1,1)`\n- Comparing this result with the given options, we find that it matches option A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1911054"}, {"introduction": "After analyzing how circuits behave and identifying potential timing hazards, the next step is to design circuits that are robust and reliable.
