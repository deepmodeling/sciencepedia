This first exercise provides a foundational analysis of a TTL totem-pole output stage operating under no-load conditions. By applying a simplified model for the active components, you will calculate the typical output HIGH voltage ($V_{OH}$) and gain insight into why this voltage is inherently lower than the supply voltage $V_{CC}$—a defining characteristic of classic TTL logic [@problem_id:1972524].", "problem": "Consider a standard Transistor-Transistor Logic (TTL) gate featuring a totem-pole output stage. You are tasked with estimating the typical output HIGH voltage, $V_{OH}$, for this gate when it is not connected to any load (an open-circuit condition).\n\nFor the output to be in the HIGH state, the internal logic of the gate drives the totem-pole stage such that the upper pull-up transistor is active, and the lower pull-down transistor is in cutoff. In this configuration, the upper transistor, a Bipolar Junction Transistor (BJT), acts as an emitter-follower. A widely used simplified model for analysis under no-load conditions assumes that the base of this pull-up transistor is biased at the supply potential, $V_{CC}$.

We can determine this voltage by analyzing the potential drops along the path from a point of known voltage to the output terminal.\n\nAccording to the problem description, when the output is HIGH, the upper pull-up transistor is active and its base is held at the supply potential, $V_{CC}$. The output terminal, where $V_{OH}$ is measured, is connected to the emitter of this transistor through a series diode. This establishes a path from the base of the transistor to the output. We can apply Kirchhoff's Voltage Law (KVL) along this path.\n\nLet's denote the voltage at the base of the pull-up transistor as $V_{base}$. The problem states that for this simplified model, $V_{base} = V_{CC}$. The path from the base to the output involves two voltage drops in series: the base-emitter junction of the transistor, $V_{BE(on)}$, and the forward-biased series diode, $V_{D(on)}$.\n\nThe KVL equation for this path can be written as:\n$$V_{base} - V_{BE(on)} - V_{D(on)} = V_{OH}$$\n\nWe are given the following values:\n$V_{CC} = 5.0 \\, \\text{V}$\n$V_{BE(on)} = 0.7 \\, \\text{V}$\n$V_{D(on)} = 0.7 \\, \\text{V}$\n\nSubstituting the value of $V_{base} = V_{CC}$ into our KVL equation, we get:\n$$V_{OH} = V_{CC} - V_{BE(on)} - V_{D(on)}$$\n\nNow, we can substitute the numerical values into this expression to find $V_{OH}$:\n$$V_{OH} = 5.0 \\, \\text{V} - 0.7 \\, \\text{V} - 0.7 \\, \\text{V}$$\n$$V_{OH} = 5.0 \\, \\text{V} - 1.4 \\, \\text{V}$$\n$$V_{OH} = 3.6 \\, \\text{V}$$\n\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to two significant figures.

This practice explores the behavior of a TTL NAND gate when its pull-down transistor fails and becomes an open circuit. By analyzing the gate's response across all input combinations, you will see how the complementary \"push-pull\" action of the totem-pole is disrupted, leading to the important and distinct concept of a high-impedance or \"floating\" output state [@problem_id:1972508].", "problem": "Consider a standard two-input Transistor-Transistor Logic (TTL) NAND gate. The circuit consists of a multi-emitter input transistor (Q1), a phase-splitter transistor (Q2), and a totem-pole output stage. The totem-pole stage is composed of an upper pull-up transistor (Q3), a diode (D1), and a lower pull-down transistor (Q4). The output of the gate is taken from the node between the diode D1 and the collector of Q4.\n\nSuppose a manufacturing defect causes a specific internal fault in the gate. The lower pull-down transistor, Q4, fails in such a way that it behaves as a permanent open circuit between its collector and emitter terminals. The rest of the gate's components, including all other transistors and resistors, function correctly according to their design specifications. A logic HIGH corresponds to the supply voltage $V_{CC}$ and a logic LOW corresponds to ground (0 V).\n\nAnalyze the behavior of this faulty gate. Which of the following statements most accurately describes the logical and electrical state of the output terminal Y for all possible input combinations (A, B)?\n\nA. The gate output Y will be permanently stuck at a logic HIGH level, regardless of the inputs A and B.\nB. The gate output Y will be permanently stuck at a logic LOW level, regardless of the inputs A and B.\nC. The gate will function as a perfect AND gate.\nD. The gate will function correctly as a NAND gate for all input combinations except when both inputs A and B are HIGH, in which case the output Y will be in a high-impedance (floating) state.\nE. The gate will function correctly as a NAND gate for all input combinations. The specified fault has no effect on the gate's logical output.", "solution": "We model a standard TTL two-input NAND gate with a totem-pole output stage. Let the inputs be $A$ and $B$, and the output be $Y$. In a fault-free gate, the logic function is $Y=\\overline{AB}$. The totem-pole stage consists of an upper pull-up path through the transistor $Q_{3}$ and series diode $D_{1}$, and a lower pull-down path through $Q_{4}$ to ground. The phase-splitter $Q_{2}$ drives $Q_{3}$ and $Q_{4}$ in complementary fashion:\n- For any input combination with at least one input LOW, the multi-emitter input transistor $Q_{1}$ biases $Q_{2}$ OFF. This turns $Q_{3}$ ON (pull-up active) and $Q_{4}$ OFF (pull-down inactive), yielding $Y$ HIGH via the path $V_{CC} \\to Q_{3} \\to D_{1} \\to Y$.\n- For both inputs HIGH, $Q_{1}$ biases $Q_{2}$ ON. This turns $Q_{3}$ OFF and $Q_{4}$ ON, providing an active pull-down to ground so that $Y$ is LOW.\n\nNow impose the specified fault: $Q_{4}$ is permanently open between its collector and emitter. All other devices operate correctly.\n\nAnalyze each input case:\n\n1) Case where $\\overline{AB}=1$ (i.e., at least one of $A$ or $B$ is LOW). As in the fault-free case, $Q_{2}$ is OFF, $Q_{3}$ is ON, and the path $V_{CC} \\to Q_{3} \\to D_{1} \\to Y$ actively sources current. The diode $D_{1}$ is forward-biased in this pull-up condition, so $Y$ is driven to a logic HIGH. The state of $Q_{4}$ is irrelevant because with $Q_{2}$ OFF the intended pull-down is OFF and, in any case, the $Q_{4}$ collector-emitter path is open. Therefore, $Y$ is a valid HIGH in all input cases where $AB=0$.\n\n2) Case $A=B=1$. In the fault-free gate, $Q_{2}$ would turn $Q_{3}$ OFF and $Q_{4}$ ON, actively pulling $Y$ LOW. Under the fault, $Q_{3}$ still turns OFF, but $Q_{4}$ cannot conduct to ground because its collector-emitter path is an open circuit. The diode $D_{1}$, being in series with $Q_{3}$’s emitter and oriented to conduct only when $Q_{3}$ is sourcing current, is reverse-biased or otherwise non-conducting when $Q_{3}$ is OFF. Hence, there is no active path from $V_{CC}$ to $Y$ and no active path from $Y$ to ground. Therefore, the output node $Y$ is undriven, i.e., in a high-impedance (floating) state. Any residual leakage paths (for example, through junction leakages) are not designed drive paths and do not provide a valid logic LOW.\n\nCombining these results:\n- For $AB=0$, the gate behaves as a correct NAND: $Y$ is driven HIGH by $Q_{3}$ through $D_{1}$.\n- For $AB=1$, the intended LOW cannot be produced because $Q_{4}$ is open; with $Q_{3}$ OFF and $D_{1}$ non-conducting, $Y$ is left floating (high-impedance).\n\nThis behavior matches the statement that the gate functions correctly as a NAND gate for all input combinations except when both inputs are HIGH, in which case the output is high-impedance.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate choice is D.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "1972508"}, {"introduction": "Real-world components don't always behave like their ideal counterparts, and their characteristics can change over time.
