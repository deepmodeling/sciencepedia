The first gate has inputs designated as A and B, and the second gate has inputs designated as C and D. Both gates are designed with open-collector outputs.

A single pull-up resistor is connected between this node Y and the high voltage supply, Vcc (which represents a logic '1').

This allows multiple peripheral devices to signal an interrupt to a central processor on a single wire. The bus is formed by connecting the outputs of several logic gates, each with an open-collector output. An open-collector output can either pull the line down to a logic '0' (ground) or effectively disconnect itself, presenting a high-impedance state.

The bus line's state is indeterminate and will be randomly determined by thermal noise.", "solution": "The problem asks for the state of a wired-AND bus line when its pull-up resistor has failed and no connected gates are actively driving the line.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Wired-AND Configuration**\nA wired-AND bus is a common digital logic technique where the outputs of several open-collector or open-drain gates are connected together. The logical function is that the bus line is HIGH (logic '1') if and only if ALL gate outputs are in their non-asserted state. If any single gate asserts its output, it pulls the entire bus line LOW (logic '0'). This is logically equivalent to an AND function of the individual outputs.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Role of the Open-Collector Output**\nAn open-collector output stage of a logic gate has two states:\n1.  **Active Low State**: The output transistor is turned on, creating a low-resistance path from the output pin to ground. This actively pulls the bus line down to a logic '0' voltage level.\n2.  **High-Impedance State (Inactive State)**: The output transistor is turned off. In this state, the gate's output pin is effectively disconnected from the internal circuitry. It neither pulls the line to ground nor pushes it to the supply voltage. It presents a very high impedance to the bus.\n\nCrucially, an open-collector gate can only pull the line LOW. It cannot drive it HIGH.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Role of the Pull-Up Resistor**\nThe pull-up resistor is essential for the correct operation of a wired-AND bus. Its function is to provide a default HIGH state. When all open-collector gates are in their high-impedance state, there is no active device pulling the bus line low. The pull-up resistor then provides a path for current from the supply voltage ($V_{CC}$) to the bus line, \"pulling\" the voltage of the line up to $V_{CC}$, which corresponds to a logic '1'.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the Fault Condition**\nThe problem states that the pull-up resistor has failed and is now an open circuit. This means there is no longer a connection from the bus line to the supply voltage $V_{CC}$ through this resistor.\n\nThe problem also specifies that at the moment in question, none of the peripheral devices are asserting an interrupt. This means all connected open-collector gates are in their high-impedance (inactive) state.\n\n**Step 5: Determine the Resulting Bus State**\nWith all gates in their high-impedance state, none are pulling the line LOW.\nWith the pull-up resistor being an open circuit, nothing is pulling the line HIGH.\n\nTherefore, the bus line is not connected to any voltage source (neither $V_{CC}$ nor ground) through a low-resistance path. It is completely disconnected from any driving circuitry. This condition is, by definition, a high-impedance state, often referred to as \"floating.\"\n\nLet's evaluate the given options:\nA. The bus line cannot be at logic '0' because no gate is actively pulling it to ground.\nB. The bus line cannot be at logic '1' because the pull-up resistor, which is responsible for this state, has failed.\nC. The bus line is not being driven HIGH or LOW. This correctly describes a high-impedance or floating state.\nD. Oscillation would typically require some form of feedback or an input to a gate being in a metastable region, causing the gate's output to toggle. While a floating line *fed into* another gate's input can cause issues, the state of the line *itself* is not inherently oscillatory; it is simply floating.\nE. While thermal noise exists, it does not define the logical or electrical state. The defining characteristic is the lack of a low-impedance path to any voltage rail, which is the definition of high-impedance.\n\nThus, the correct description of the bus line's state is high-impedance or floating.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1977723"}]}
