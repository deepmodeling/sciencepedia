One arm is a wide cylindrical reservoir with a cross-sectional area $A_1$, and the other is a narrow cylindrical tube with a cross-sectional area $A_2$. Both arms are open to the atmosphere initially, and the manometric fluid, of constant density $\\rho$, sits at the same equilibrium level in both.\n\nThe gas inlet is connected to the top of the wide reservoir. The increased gas pressure pushes the fluid down by a distance $h_1$ in the reservoir and causes it to rise by a distance $h_2$ in the narrow tube, relative to the initial equilibrium level. The gauge pressure of the gas is the difference between the gas pressure and the atmospheric pressure.\n\nIn many practical applications where the reservoir is very large compared to the narrow tube (i.e., $A_1 \\gg A_2$), the drop in the fluid level in the reservoir, $h_1$, is considered negligible.
