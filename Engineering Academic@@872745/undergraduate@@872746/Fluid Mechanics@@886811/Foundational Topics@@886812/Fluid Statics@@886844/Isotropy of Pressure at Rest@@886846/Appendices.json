This practice guides you through a classic proof using a small, wedge-shaped fluid element to represent a point. By applying the principles of static equilibrium ($\\sum \\mathbf{F} = 0$), you will see how the pressures on the different faces of the element must relate to each other and why they must become equal as the element shrinks to an infinitesimal point [@problem_id:1767797].", "problem": "To analyze the behavior of fluid pressure at a point, investigators model a small region of fluid as a two-dimensional wedge. Consider such a wedge of a static, incompressible fluid with uniform density $\\rho$. The wedge-shaped fluid element has a horizontal base of infinitesimal length $dx$ and a vertical side of infinitesimal length $dy$. A uniform gravitational field, with acceleration of magnitude $g$, acts vertically downwards. Let $p_y$ be the pressure acting on the horizontal face, $p_x$ be the pressure on the vertical face, and $p_s$ be the pressure on the slanted hypotenuse. Assume the pressure is uniform over each respective face.\n\nBy applying the condition of static equilibrium to the forces acting on this fluid element, one can derive a relationship between the pressures on the different faces. It is found that the difference between the pressure on the slanted face and the pressure on the vertical face can be written in the form $p_s - p_x = A \\cdot \\rho g dx$ and the difference between the pressure on the slanted face and the pressure on the horizontal face can be written in the form $p_s - p_y = B \\cdot \\rho g dy$.
