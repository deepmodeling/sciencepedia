This transport manifests as an apparent stress on the mean flow, known as the Reynolds shear stress. This exercise moves beyond pure calculation to develop the physical intuition for the origin of this stress in a boundary layer, a crucial step in understanding how turbulence shapes mean velocity profiles [@problem_id:1766193].", "problem": "Consider a turbulent boundary layer that forms when a fluid with constant density $\\rho$ flows over a large, stationary flat plate. The mean flow is predominantly in the positive $x$-direction, parallel to the plate, and the $y$-direction is normal to the plate, with $y=0$ at the plate's surface. Within this boundary layer, the instantaneous velocity components can be decomposed into a time-averaged mean component and a fluctuating component: $u = U(y) + u'$ and $v = V(y) + v'$. For this two-dimensional boundary layer flow, the mean velocity component normal to the wall is zero, so $V(y) = 0$. The term $\\tau_{xy, \\text{turb}} = -\\rho \\overline{u'v'}$ is known as the Reynolds shear stress, where the overbar denotes a time average. This term represents the transport of $x$-momentum in the $y$-direction due to the turbulent velocity fluctuations.\n\nBased on the physical mechanism of momentum transport by turbulent eddies in a boundary layer, which of the following statements correctly describes the nature of the Reynolds shear stress?\n\nA. The Reynolds shear stress is positive. This is because fluid parcels moving away from the wall ($v'0$) generally come from slower-moving regions, resulting in $u'0$, while parcels moving towards the wall ($v'0$) come from faster-moving regions, resulting in $u'0$. In both cases, the product $u'v'$ tends to be negative, making $-\\rho \\overline{u'v'}$ positive.\n\nB. The Reynolds shear stress is negative. This is because fluid parcels moving away from the wall ($v'0$) are accelerated by the faster-moving fluid above, leading to $u'0$, while parcels moving towards the wall ($v'0$) are decelerated, leading to $u'0$. In both cases, the product $u'v'$ tends to be positive, making $-\\rho \\overline{u'v'}$ negative.\n\nC. The Reynolds shear stress is zero. This is because the velocity fluctuations $u'$ and $v'$ are random, chaotic motions. Over a sufficiently long time, positive and negative values of the product $u'v'$ will cancel each other out, leading to a zero average, $\\overline{u'v'}=0$.\n\nD. The Reynolds shear stress is positive. This is because fluid parcels moving away from the wall ($v'0$) generally come from faster-moving regions, resulting in $u'0$, while parcels moving towards the wall ($v'0$) come from slower-moving regions, resulting in $u'0$. The product $u'v'$ tends to be positive, and the negative sign in the definition is a convention that can be ignored for physical interpretation.\n\nE. The sign of the Reynolds shear stress is indeterminate without knowing the specific fluid properties or flow velocity. The correlation between $u'$ and $v'$ could be positive, negative, or zero depending on the Reynolds number.", "solution": "We decompose the instantaneous velocities as $u=U(y)+u'$ and $v=V(y)+v'$ with $V(y)=0$ for a two-dimensional, statistically steady boundary layer. The Reynolds shear stress is defined by\n$$\n\\tau_{xy,\\text{turb}}=-\\rho\\,\\overline{u'v'}.\n$$\nIn a zero-pressure-gradient boundary layer over a flat plate, the mean profile satisfies $U=U(y)$ with $dU/dy0$ for $y0$ (the streamwise mean velocity increases away from the wall).\n\nFrom the Reynolds-averaged $x$-momentum equation and the definition of total shear stress,\n$$\n\\tau_{\\text{tot}}(y)=\\mu\\,\\frac{dU}{dy}-\\rho\\,\\overline{u'v'},\n$$\nand, away from strong accelerations, $\\tau_{\\text{tot}}$ decreases approximately linearly from the wall value $\\tau_{w}0$ to near zero outside the boundary layer. Since $\\mu\\,dU/dy0$ where $dU/dy0$, the turbulent contribution must satisfy $-\\rho\\,\\overline{u'v'}\\geq 0$ in most of the boundary layer to provide the dominant part of $\\tau_{\\text{tot}}$ (except very near the wall where viscous stress dominates).

Because $dU/dy0$ and $\\nu_{t}0$, it follows that $-\\rho\\,\\overline{u'v'}0$, equivalently $\\overline{u'v'}0$.\n\nThe sign can also be deduced from the physical correlation induced by mean shear. Consider a reference level $y$:\n1) For upward-moving fluctuations ($v'0$), fluid parcels typically originate from below, where the mean speed is smaller, so at level $y$ they have $u'0$. Thus $u'v'0$.\n2) For downward-moving fluctuations ($v'0$), parcels typically originate from above, where the mean speed is larger, so at level $y$ they have $u'0$. Thus $u'v'0$.\nIn both dominant event types, the product $u'v'$ is negative, so the average $\\overline{u'v'}0$, implying $-\\rho\\,\\overline{u'v'}0$.\n\nTherefore, the Reynolds shear stress is positive in the sense of $-\\rho\\,\\overline{u'v'}0$ throughout most of the boundary layer, and the correct qualitative explanation is that upward motions carry low-momentum fluid upward while downward motions carry high-momentum fluid downward, yielding a negative correlation $\\overline{u'v'}$ and thus a positive turbulent shear stress. This corresponds to option A and rules out B (incorrect sign), C (the correlation does not average to zero because the mean shear induces systematic correlation), D (the stated correlation signs are incorrect and the negative sign cannot be ignored), and E (the sign is determined by the mean shear in a canonical turbulent boundary layer, not by specific fluid properties).", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1766193"}]}
