Frazil ice consists of small, suspended ice crystals that form in the water column. The scientists propose a \"zero-dimensional\" one-equation model, which describes the evolution of the volume fraction of ice, denoted by $\\alpha$ (a dimensionless quantity representing the volume of ice per unit volume of water-ice mixture), within a representative control volume of the river.\n\nThe model assumes that the rate of change of the ice volume fraction, $\\frac{d\\alpha}{dt}$, is determined by a balance between a production term, $P$, and a destruction term, $D$. The governing equation is:\n$$ \\frac{d\\alpha}{dt} = P - D $$\nThe production of ice is due to continuous supercooling and is modeled as a constant rate, $P = k_P$, where $k_P$ is the production rate constant with units of inverse seconds.\n\nThe destruction of ice is attributed to two primary mechanisms:\n1.  Mechanical breakup due to turbulence, which is assumed to be proportional to the ice volume fraction itself: $D_m = k_m \\alpha$, where $k_m$ is the mechanical destruction rate constant.\n2.  Buoyancy-driven removal, where the buoyant ice crystals rise and are removed from the control volume. This rate is modeled as being proportional to the net buoyancy force per unit volume of the mixture. This force is generated by the density difference between water and ice. The destruction rate from this mechanism is given by $D_b = k_b (\\rho_w - \\rho_i) g \\alpha$, where $k_b$ is the buoyancy removal rate constant, $\\rho_w$ is the density of water, $\\rho_i$ is the density of ice, and $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity.\n\nThe total destruction rate is the sum of these two effects, $D = D_m + D_b$.\n\nAssuming the system reaches a steady state where the ice volume fraction no longer changes with time, determine the steady-state ice volume fraction, $\\alpha_{ss}$.
