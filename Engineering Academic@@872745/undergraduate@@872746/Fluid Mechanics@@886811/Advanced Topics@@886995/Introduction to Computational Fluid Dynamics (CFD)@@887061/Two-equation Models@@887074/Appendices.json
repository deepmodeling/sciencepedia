Thus, the linear eddy-viscosity closure cannot generate the anisotropy of cross-plane normal stresses required to drive the turbulence-induced secondary vortices.\n\nConsequently, the fundamental reason standard two-equation Boussinesq models fail to predict these secondary flows is that they inherently enforce isotropy of the turbulent normal stresses in the cross-stream plane when the mean secondary flow is absent, eliminating the necessary source term for $\\Omega_{x}$.
