When the air flows past the wire, a phenomenon known as Aeolian tone generation occurs, producing a distinct \"singing\" sound. The fundamental frequency of this sound, $f$, is found to be related to the airflow speed, $U$, and the wire's diameter, $D$. This relationship is characterized by a dimensionless group, which we will call the Aero-acoustic constant, $C_{ae}$, defined as $C_{ae} = \\frac{fD}{U}$. For a wide range of flow conditions relevant to this application, this constant can be approximated as $C_{ae} = 0.21$.\n\nAn engineer is testing a prototype with a wire of diameter $D = 2.0$ mm.

By working through this problem, you will see how the relationship between wavelength and obstacle size governs the performance of noise mitigation strategies.", "problem": "A research facility is conducting an acoustic analysis of a stationary jet engine. The primary noise source can be modeled as a point source located at a height $h_S = 4.0 \\text{ m}$ above the ground. To shield a sensitive instrument array from the engine's noise, a very long and tall rigid acoustic barrier is constructed. The barrier has a height of $h_B = 10.0 \\text{ m}$ and is located at a horizontal distance of $L = 20.0 \\text{ m}$ from the engine's noise source. The instrument array is positioned at a height $h_R = 2.0 \\text{ m}$ above the ground and at a horizontal distance of $D = 30.0 \\text{ m}$ behind the barrier, placing it within the barrier's geometric shadow.\n\nA simplified diffraction model is proposed to estimate the sound intensity in the shadow region. According to this model, the sound intensity $I_{shadow}$ at a point in the geometric shadow is related to the intensity $I_{free}$ that would be present at the same point without the barrier by the relation:\n$$I_{shadow} = \\frac{C}{N^2} I_{free}$$\nwhere $C$ is a dimensionless constant of proportionality and $N$ is the Fresnel number. This model is considered valid for cases where $N > 1$. The Fresnel number is defined as $N = \\frac{2 \\delta}{\\lambda}$, where $\\lambda$ is the wavelength of the sound and $\\delta$ is the path length difference between the path taken by the diffracted sound wave over the top of the barrier and the direct, line-of-sight path from the source to the receiver (which is blocked by the barrier).
