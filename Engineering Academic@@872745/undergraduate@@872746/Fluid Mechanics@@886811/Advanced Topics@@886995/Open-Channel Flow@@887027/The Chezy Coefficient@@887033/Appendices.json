They have constructed a long, straight prototype channel with a rectangular cross-section of constant width $b = 3.50$ m. The channel is laid with a constant longitudinal bed slope of $S = 0.0016$. During a test, water is introduced into the channel and is allowed to flow until it reaches a uniform flow condition, where the flow depth remains constant along the length of the channel. A measurement under these uniform flow conditions indicates a water depth of $y = 0.75$ m.

This conceptual problem challenges you to think critically about the physical assumptions that underpin the Chezy formula [@problem_id:1798162]. By analyzing why it is inappropriate for pressurized pipe flow, you will solidify your grasp of the fundamental difference between gravity-driven open-channel flow and pressure-driven closed-conduit flow.", "problem": "The average velocity, $V$, of steady, uniform flow in an open channel can be estimated using the empirical Chezy formula, given by:\n$$V = C \\sqrt{R_h S_0}$$\nwhere $C$ is the Chezy coefficient which accounts for surface roughness, $R_h$ is the hydraulic radius defined as the cross-sectional area of flow divided by the wetted perimeter, and $S_0$ is the slope of the channel bed.\n\nConsider an engineer who is new to fluid dynamics and attempts to apply this formula to analyze the flow in a long, straight, pressurized water main that is flowing completely full. Which of the following statements provides the most fundamental physical reason why the Chezy formula, in its standard form, is inappropriate for this application?\n\nA. The formula uses the channel bed slope $S_0$ as the driving gradient, which is valid for gravity-driven open-channel flow but not for pressurized pipe flow where the driving force is a pressure gradient that is independent of the pipe's physical slope.\n\nB. For a full pipe, the hydraulic radius $R_h$ becomes a constant value (one-fourth of the pipe diameter), which invalidates the underlying assumptions used to derive the variable relationship in the formula.\n\nC. The Chezy coefficient $C$ is a dimensional constant derived from experiments in open channels with a free surface, making it numerically incorrect for closed-conduit flow.\n\nD. The Chezy formula is only valid for laminar flow regimes, while the flow in a pressurized water main is almost always turbulent.\n\nE. The formula assumes the wetted perimeter is in contact with a solid boundary, but in a full pipe, there is no \"free surface,\" meaning the wetted perimeter is the entire circumference.", "solution": "We begin with the given empirical formula for steady, uniform open-channel flow:\n$$V = C \\sqrt{R_h S_0},$$\nwhere $V$ is the average velocity, $C$ is the Chezy coefficient, $R_h$ is the hydraulic radius, and $S_0$ is the bed slope. In uniform open-channel flow, the fundamental force balance states that the component of gravity along the channel is balanced by boundary shear, which implies that the energy grade line slope equals the water surface slope and the bed slope:\n$$S_f = S = S_0.$$\nThus, in open-channel uniform flow, $S_0$ correctly represents the driving head loss gradient.\n\nFor pressurized full-pipe flow, the driving mechanism is a streamwise pressure gradient rather than a component of weight due to a free surface. The appropriate energy equation between two sections for steady, incompressible flow is\n$$z_{1} + \\frac{p_{1}}{\\rho g} + \\frac{V^{2}}{2g} = z_{2} + \\frac{p_{2}}{\\rho g} + \\frac{V^{2}}{2g} + h_{L},$$\nso that the head loss per unit length defines the friction slope\n$$S_{f} \\equiv \\frac{h_{L}}{L} = -\\frac{1}{\\rho g}\\frac{dp}{dx},$$\nwhich is the true driving gradient for fully filled, pressurized pipe flow. Importantly, $S_{f}$ is determined by the pressure field (and flow resistance) and is generally independent of the pipe’s geometric slope $S_{0}$. For example, a horizontal pressurized pipe has $S_{0} = 0$ but can sustain nonzero flow when $\\frac{dp}{dx} \\neq 0$, so using $S_{0}$ as the driving gradient would incorrectly give $V = 0$.\n\nThe standard resistance relation for pipe flow, written in terms of hydraulic radius, is the Darcy–Weisbach form:\n$$S_{f} = \\frac{f V^{2}}{8 g R_{h}},$$\nsince for a circular pipe $D = 4 R_{h}$ and $S_{f} = f V^{2} / (2 g D)$. Solving for $V$ gives\n$$V = \\sqrt{\\frac{8 g R_{h} S_{f}}{f}}.$$\nComparing this with Chezy’s form shows an equivalence only if one replaces $S_{0}$ by $S_{f}$ and identifies\n$$C = \\sqrt{\\frac{8 g}{f}}.$$\nTherefore, the essential incompatibility of the Chezy formula “in its standard form” for pressurized pipe flow is the use of $S_{0}$ rather than the correct driving gradient $S_{f}$ (or equivalently $-\\frac{1}{\\rho g}\\frac{dp}{dx}$). This is the most fundamental physical reason.\n\nWe briefly address the other options:\n- Option B: While $R_{h} = \\frac{D}{4}$ for a full circular pipe, this constancy does not invalidate the physics; it simply fixes geometry. It is not the fundamental reason.\n- Option C: Although $C$ is empirical and originally calibrated for open channels, it can be related to $f$ via $C = \\sqrt{\\frac{8 g}{f}}$; the dimensionality is not the fundamental issue.\n- Option D: Chezy-type relations are intended for turbulent resistance; the statement that it is only valid for laminar flow is incorrect.\n- Option E: The fully wetted perimeter is already accommodated through $R_{h}$; the absence of a free surface is not the fundamental issue—rather, it is the incorrect driving slope.\n\nThus, the most fundamental reason is that the Chezy formula in standard form uses $S_{0}$ (bed slope) instead of the pressure-driven energy gradient appropriate for pressurized full-pipe flow.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1798162"}, {"introduction": "Beyond simple analysis, engineering often involves making optimal design choices.
