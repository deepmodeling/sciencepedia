We can express the velocity $v$ as $v = q/y$. Substituting this into the specific energy equation eliminates $v$:\n$$E = y + \\frac{(q/y)^2}{2g} = y + \\frac{q^2}{2gy^2}$$\nThis equation gives the specific energy in terms of the depth $y$ and the constant discharge per unit width $q$.\n\nNext, we introduce the Froude number, $Fr$:\n$$Fr = \\frac{v}{\\sqrt{gy}}$$\nSquaring the Froude number gives:\n$$Fr^2 = \\frac{v^2}{gy}$$\nWe can substitute $v = q/y$ into this equation as well:\n$$Fr^2 = \\frac{(q/y)^2}{gy} = \\frac{q^2}{gy^3}$$\nThis equation relates the flow depth $y$ to the Froude number $Fr$ for a given $q$. We can rearrange it to solve for $y$:\n$$y^3 = \\frac{q^2}{g Fr^2} \\implies y = \\left(\\frac{q^2}{g}\\right)^{1/3} Fr^{-2/3}$$\n\nNow we have two ways to proceed. One way is to express the specific energy $E$ entirely as a function of $Fr$ and constants. To do this, we can first an express the velocity head term, $v^2/(2g)$, in terms of $y$ and $Fr$. From the definition of $Fr^2$, we have $v^2 = Fr^2 g y$.\nSubstituting this into the specific energy equation:\n$$E = y + \\frac{Fr^2 g y}{2g} = y \\left(1 + \\frac{Fr^2}{2}\\right)$$\nNow, we can substitute the expression for $y$ in terms of $Fr$:\n$$E = \\left[ \\left(\\frac{q^2}{g}\\right)^{1/3} Fr^{-2/3} \\right] \\left(1 + \\frac{Fr^2}{2}\\right)$$\nSince $(q^2/g)^{1/3}$ is a constant for both channels, the specific energy $E$ is proportional to the term $Fr^{-2/3} \\left(1 + \\frac{Fr^2}{2}\\right)$. We need to compare the value of this term for Channel A ($Fr_A = 0.5$) and Channel B ($Fr_B = 2.0$).\n\nLet's calculate the ratio of the specific energies, $E_B / E_A$:\n$$\\frac{E_B}{E_A} = \\frac{y_B \\left(1 + \\frac{Fr_B^2}{2}\\right)}{y_A \\left(1 + \\frac{Fr_A^2}{2}\\right)}$$\nWe know the ratio of the depths from the relation $y \\propto Fr^{-2/3}$:\n$$\\frac{y_B}{y_A} = \\frac{Fr_B^{-2/3}}{Fr_A^{-2/3}} = \\left(\\frac{Fr_A}{Fr_B}\\right)^{2/3}$$\nSubstituting the given values $Fr_A=0.5$ and $Fr_B=2.0$:\n$$\\frac{y_B}{y_A} = \\left(\\frac{0.5}{2.0}\\right)^{2/3} = \\left(\\frac{1}{4}\\right)^{2/3} = \\frac{1}{4^{2/3}} = \\frac{1}{(16)^{1/3}}$$\nNow we substitute this depth ratio and the Froude numbers back into the specific energy ratio expression:\n$$\\frac{E_B}{E_A} = \\left(\\frac{1}{16^{1/3}}\\right) \\frac{\\left(1 + \\frac{2.0^2}{2}\\right)}{\\left(1 + \\frac{0.5^2}{2}\\right)} = \\left(\\frac{1}{16^{1/3}}\\right) \\frac{1 + 2}{1 + 0.125} = \\left(\\frac{1}{16^{1/3}}\\right) \\frac{3}{1.125} = \\left(\\frac{1}{16^{1/3}}\\right) \\frac{3}{9/8} = \\frac{1}{16^{1/3}} \\frac{24}{9} = \\frac{8}{3 \\cdot 16^{1/3}}$$\nTo simplify $16^{1/3}$, we can write $16 = 8 \\times 2$:\n$$16^{1/3} = (8 \\times 2)^{1/3} = 8^{1/3} \\times 2^{1/3} = 2 \\cdot 2^{1/3} = 2\\sqrt[3]{2}$$\nSubstituting this back into the ratio:\n$$\\frac{E_B}{E_A} = \\frac{8}{3 \\cdot (2\\sqrt[3]{2})} = \\frac{4}{3\\sqrt[3]{2}}$$\nTo determine if this ratio is greater or less than 1, we can compare the numerator and the denominator. We compare $4$ and $3\\sqrt[3]{2}$. Let's cube both values to remove the cube root.\n$$4^3 = 64$$\n$$(3\\sqrt[3]{2})^3 = 3^3 \\cdot (\\sqrt[3]{2})^3 = 27 \\cdot 2 = 54$$\nSince $64  54$, it follows that $4  3\\sqrt[3]{2}$. Therefore, the numerator is larger than the denominator.\n$$\\frac{E_B}{E_A}  1$$\nThis implies that $E_B  E_A$, or equivalently, $E_A  E_B$.\n\nThis result shows that for a given discharge per unit width, the specific energy is not symmetric around the critical point ($Fr=1$). The flow in the supercritical regime ($Fr_B=2.0$) has a higher specific energy than the flow in the subcritical regime ($Fr_A=0.5$). The relationship is independent of the specific value of $q$, so option D is incorrect. Option C is only true for alternate depths, which would require $E_A = E_B$ by definition, but this is what we seek to determine. Our calculation shows they are not equal.
