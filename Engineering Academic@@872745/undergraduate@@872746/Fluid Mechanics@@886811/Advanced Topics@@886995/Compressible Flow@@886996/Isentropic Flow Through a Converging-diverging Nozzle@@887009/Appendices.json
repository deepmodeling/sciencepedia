This exercise [@problem_id:1767638] challenges you to apply the area-velocity relation for isentropic flow. By analyzing the relationship between area change and velocity change for both subsonic and supersonic regimes, you will uncover the crucial reason why flow can only become sonic at the throat and not within the converging section.", "problem": "A large reservoir containing a gas at rest (Mach number effectively zero) is connected to the inlet of a well-designed converging-diverging nozzle. The gas flows from the reservoir, through the nozzle, and exits to a region of low pressure. The flow process through the nozzle can be considered steady and isentropic.\n\nConsider the physical behavior of the gas as it moves through the converging section of this nozzle (the section between the reservoir inlet and the throat). Is it possible for the flow to become supersonic (Mach number > 1) within this converging section? Select the option below that provides the correct answer and the most accurate physical justification.\n\nA. Yes, because a converging geometry always causes an increase in flow velocity, regardless of the Mach number.\n\nB. No, because the governing principles of one-dimensional isentropic flow dictate that a supersonic stream ($M > 1$) decelerates in a converging channel. Therefore, a flow cannot accelerate from subsonic to supersonic within that converging section.\n\nC. Yes, if the pressure ratio across the nozzle is large enough, the flow can be forced to become supersonic at any point in the converging section.\n\nD. No, because the flow velocity must be zero at the nozzle wall due to the no-slip condition, which prevents the bulk flow from reaching supersonic speeds in a converging geometry.", "solution": "For steady, one-dimensional, isentropic flow in a quasi-one-dimensional nozzle, let $A$ be the local cross-sectional area, $V$ the bulk speed, $\\rho$ the density, $p$ the pressure, and $a$ the local speed of sound.

For subsonic flow ($M1$), the factor $(M^{2}-1)0$, hence\n$$\n\\frac{dV}{V} = \\frac{dA/A}{M^{2}-1}  0,\n$$\nwhich shows that a subsonic stream accelerates in a converging passage. However, as long as $M1$, this acceleration cannot produce $M>1$ within the converging section. The transition to $M=1$ must occur where $dA=0$, i.e., at an extremum of area. From\n$$\n\\frac{dA}{A} = \\left(M^{2}-1\\right)\\frac{dV}{V},\n$$\nif $dA=0$ and $dV\\neq 0$, the only possibility is $M=1$. Thus, choking (reaching $M=1$) occurs at the minimum area (the throat). To achieve $M>1$ and further acceleration, the area must increase downstream ($dA>0$), i.e., in the diverging section. Conversely, if one imagined $M>1$ within the converging part ($dA0$), then $(M^{2}-1)>0$ would imply $\\frac{dV}{V}0$, i.e., deceleration, contradicting the requirement to accelerate from subsonic to supersonic in that region.\n\nTherefore, starting from a reservoir with effectively zero Mach number, the flow accelerates through the converging section but remains subsonic up to the throat, where $M=1$. It cannot become supersonic within the converging section under steady, isentropic conditions. This directly supports option B. Options A and C ignore the area–Mach relation, and D invokes the no-slip condition at the wall, which is irrelevant to the inviscid, isentropic, quasi-one-dimensional core flow considered here.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1767638"}, {"introduction": "Having established that the flow can reach a Mach number of $M=1$ at the throat, we can now determine the specific state of the gas at this critical point.
