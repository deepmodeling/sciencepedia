For parallel shear flows, where the mean velocity is of the form $\\vec{V} = (U(y), 0, 0)$, the stability to two-dimensional infinitesimal disturbances can be investigated using the Orr-Sommerfeld equation. This equation governs the complex amplitude of the streamfunction perturbation, $\\phi(y)$, and is given by:\n\n$$ \\left(\\frac{d^2}{dy^2} - k^2\\right)^2 \\phi = i k \\text{Re} \\left[ (U(y) - c)\\left(\\frac{d^2}{dy^2} - k^2\\right)\\phi - U''(y)\\phi \\right] $$\n\nHere, $y$ is the coordinate transverse to the flow, $k$ is the dimensionless wavenumber of the disturbance, $\\text{Re}$ is the Reynolds number, and $c$ is the complex wavespeed of the disturbance. The flow is considered unstable if any disturbance mode exists for which the imaginary part of $c$ is positive. The second derivative of the mean velocity profile is denoted by $U''(y) = \\frac{d^2U}{dy^2}$. The equation is typically solved with no-slip boundary conditions ($\\phi=0$ and $d\\phi/dy=0$) at the solid walls.\n\nConsider the case of plane Couette flow, where a fluid is confined between two infinite parallel plates, one stationary and the other moving with a constant velocity. This setup generates a linear mean velocity profile, $U(y) = Ay + B$, where $A$ and $B$ are constants. It is a well-established theoretical result that plane Couette flow is stable to infinitesimal disturbances for all Reynolds numbers.\n\nWithout attempting to solve the Orr-Sommerfeld equation, identify the fundamental reason for the universal stability of plane Couette flow according to linear theory.\n\nA. The viscous dissipation term on the left-hand side of the equation is always dominant for any disturbance, regardless of the Reynolds number, ensuring all perturbations are damped out.\n\nB.

For a linear profile, $U''(y)\\equiv 0$ everywhere, so there is no inflection point and hence no inviscid instability.\n\nIn the viscous (Orr-Sommerfeld) setting, the same $U''(y)$ term is the only one that can enable the primary instability mechanism (inflectional/curvature-driven transfer) by coupling the disturbance to the mean shear in a way that can produce exponential growth. When $U''(y)=0$, this coupling vanishes, leaving only advection by $U(y)-c$ (which by itself does not change the disturbance energy) opposed by the dissipative operator on the left-hand side, which damps disturbances. Consequently, with the curvature term identically zero for plane Couette flow, there is no linear mechanism available in the Orr-Sommerfeld framework to extract energy from the mean flow to drive exponential growth, and all infinitesimal disturbances decay.\n\nTherefore, the fundamental reason for universal linear stability of plane Couette flow is the vanishing of $U''(y)$ for its linear mean profile, which removes the only term in the Orr-Sommerfeld/Rayleigh formulation capable of driving instability.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1778263"}, {"introduction": "Having explored the theoretical criteria for instability, we can now apply these tools to a classic and physically important problem: the instability of a planar jet.
