We will contrast a co-rotating system with a counter-rotating one, using a simplified version of Rayleigh's criterion for inviscid fluids, which links instability to the radial gradient of angular momentum. While this is a simplification, it powerfully illustrates the core physical mechanism: counter-rotation creates a much more \"adverse\" angular momentum profile that strongly promotes the centrifugal instability. This exercise provides a deeper conceptual grasp of why the system becomes unstable, moving beyond dimensionless numbers to the underlying physics of centrifugal forces and angular momentum conservation [@problem_id:1796801].", "problem": "A Taylor-Couette apparatus consists of two long, independently rotating concentric cylinders with an incompressible fluid filling the gap between them.

The flow can transition from a simple laminar state to a more complex state containing Taylor vortices.\n\nThe onset of this centrifugal instability is primarily governed by a condition first identified by Lord Rayleigh for inviscid fluids. The Rayleigh criterion suggests that the flow is susceptible to instability if the square of the specific angular momentum decreases with the radial distance from the axis of rotation.
