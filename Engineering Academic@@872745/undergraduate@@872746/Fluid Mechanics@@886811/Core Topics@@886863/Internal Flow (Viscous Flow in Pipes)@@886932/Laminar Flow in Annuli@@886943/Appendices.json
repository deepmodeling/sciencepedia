However, let's analyze the sign of $f'(\\kappa)$ for $\\kappa \\in (0, 1)$. Both terms in the derivative are composed of squares and are thus positive, so we are subtracting two positive quantities.\nTo determine the sign, it's helpful to analyze the behavior of the two terms separately. Let $T_1(\\kappa) = \\frac{4\\kappa}{(1-\\kappa^2)^2}$ and $T_2(\\kappa) = \\frac{1}{\\kappa(\\ln \\kappa)^2}$.\n- As $\\kappa \\to 0^+$, $T_1 \\to 0$ and $T_2 \\to \\infty$ (since $\\lim_{\\kappa\\to 0^+} \\kappa(\\ln \\kappa)^2 = 0$).

More careful analysis shows that $T_1(\\kappa) < T_2(\\kappa)$ for $\\kappa$ approaching 1.\nIn fact, for the entire domain $\\kappa \\in (0,1)$, it can be shown that $\\frac{4\\kappa}{(1-\\kappa^2)^2} < \\frac{1}{\\kappa(\\ln \\kappa)^2}$. Therefore, $f'(\\kappa)$ is always negative.\n\nSince the derivative $f'(\\kappa)$ is always negative for $\\kappa \\in (0, 1)$, the function $f(\\kappa)$ is a strictly decreasing function over its entire domain. A strictly decreasing function achieves its maximum value at the lowest possible value of its argument. In this case, the domain is $(0,1)$, so the maximum is approached in the limit as $\\kappa \\to 0$.\n\nLet's check the limits of $f(\\kappa)$:\n- As $\\kappa \\to 0^+$, $f(\\kappa) \\to \\frac{1+0}{1-0} + \\frac{1}{-\\infty} = 1$.\n- As $\\kappa \\to 1^-$, $f(\\kappa) = \\frac{1+\\kappa^2}{1-\\kappa^2} + \\frac{1}{\\ln(\\kappa)} = \\frac{(1+\\kappa^2)\\ln \\kappa + (1-\\kappa^2)}{(1-\\kappa^2)\\ln\\kappa}$. Using L'Hôpital's rule or a Taylor expansion, this limit evaluates to 0.\n\nThe function $f(\\kappa)$ decreases from a value of 1 at $\\kappa=0$ to 0 at $\\kappa=1$. The maximum value is at $\\kappa=0$.\nPhysically, $\\kappa=0$ corresponds to an annulus where the inner radius is zero, which is simply a circular pipe of area $A$. The additional inner wall in an annulus for any $\\kappa > 0$ introduces more wetted perimeter and thus more viscous drag, reducing the flow rate compared to a simple pipe of the same cross-sectional area and pressure gradient.\n\nTherefore, the volumetric flow rate is maximized in the limit $\\kappa \\to 0$.
