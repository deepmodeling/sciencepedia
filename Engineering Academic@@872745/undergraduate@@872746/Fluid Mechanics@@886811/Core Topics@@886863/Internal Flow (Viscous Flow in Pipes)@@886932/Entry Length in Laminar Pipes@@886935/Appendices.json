The device contains a long, straight, circular micro-channel through which a buffer solution flows. For the sorting mechanism to function correctly, the fluid flow must be fully developed, meaning the velocity profile is stable and no longer changes with distance along the channel. The transition from a uniform velocity profile at the entrance to a fully developed profile occurs over a region known as the hydrodynamic entry length, denoted as $L_e$.\n\nThe flow regime is characterized by the Reynolds number, a dimensionless quantity given by $\\text{Re}$.

A viscous dielectric fluid is used as the coolant, which flows through smooth, circular pipes to dissipate heat from processors. The flow is maintained in the laminar regime to ensure silent and predictable operation.

The evolution of the velocity profile from uniform to parabolic involves a change in the fluid's momentum flux, which requires an additional pressure drop beyond that caused by wall friction. By applying the integral momentum equation to a control volume, you will derive an expression for this \"extra\" pressure loss, connecting the abstract concept of the momentum-flux correction factor, $\\beta$, to a measurable physical quantity [@problem_id:1753783].", "problem": "An incompressible fluid of constant density $\\rho$ flows from a large reservoir into a long, horizontal, circular pipe of constant cross-sectional area $A$. At the pipe inlet (section 1), the velocity profile is approximately uniform. Far downstream, in the fully developed region (section 2), the velocity profile has changed to its final, stable shape. The average velocity, defined as the volumetric flow rate divided by the area, is constant along the pipe and is denoted by $V_{avg}$.\n\nThe momentum-flux correction factor, $\\beta$, is a dimensionless quantity that accounts for the non-uniformity of the velocity profile when calculating the axial momentum flow rate. It is defined as $\\beta = \\frac{1}{A V_{avg}^2} \\int_A u^2 dA$, where $u$ is the local axial velocity. Let $\\beta_1$ be the value of this factor at the inlet and $\\beta_2$ be its value in the fully developed region.\n\nThe total pressure drop from the inlet to the fully developed section is the result of forces needed to overcome viscous friction at the pipe walls and to change the momentum flux of the fluid as the velocity profile evolves.
