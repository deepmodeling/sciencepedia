This problem shifts focus from calculation to physical reasoning, exploring the concept of the Kutta condition.

[@problem_id:1801113]", "problem": "An aerospace engineer is analyzing the flow over a newly designed cambered airfoil in a steady, inviscid, incompressible flow within a wind tunnel. The airfoil is set at its \"zero-lift angle of attack,\" denoted as $\\alpha_{L=0}$, which is the specific angle of attack at which the net aerodynamic lift produced by the airfoil is precisely zero. The Kutta-Joukowski theorem states that the lift per unit span, $L'$, is given by the expression $L' = \\rho_{\\infty} U_{\\infty} \\Gamma$, where $\\rho_{\\infty}$ is the freestream fluid density, $U_{\\infty}$ is the freestream velocity, and $\\Gamma$ is the circulation around the airfoil. Given that the lift is zero, it follows that the circulation $\\Gamma$ must also be zero.\n\nWhich of the following statements provides the most accurate physical justification for why the circulation $\\Gamma$ becomes zero at this particular angle of attack for a cambered airfoil?\n\nA. At the zero-lift angle of attack, the pressure difference between the upper and lower surfaces of the airfoil becomes exactly zero at every point along the chord. This implies that the flow velocities on both surfaces are identical, leading to zero circulation.\n\nB. The zero-lift angle of attack orients the airfoil such that the freestream velocity vector $U_{\\infty}$ is perfectly parallel to the airfoil's chord line, creating a symmetric flow pattern that cannot support circulation.\n\nC. At any angle of attack, a physically realistic flow must leave the sharp trailing edge smoothly. This requirement, known as the Kutta condition, is satisfied by a unique value of circulation. The zero-lift angle of attack is the specific orientation where this unique circulation value required to ensure smooth flow off the trailing edge is precisely zero.\n\nD. According to vortex dynamics, the total circulation in the fluid, including the airfoil and its wake, must be conserved at zero. At the zero-lift angle of attack, the wake contains no shed vortices, which forces the circulation bound to the airfoil to also be zero.\n\nE. At the zero-lift angle of attack, the fluid's boundary layer remains fully attached to the airfoil surface. This absence of flow separation is the primary reason for the nullification of circulation.", "solution": "By the Kutta-Joukowski theorem, the lift per unit span is \n$$L'=\\rho_{\\infty} U_{\\infty} \\Gamma.$$\nTherefore, $L'=0$ implies $\\Gamma=0$. The question asks for the physical mechanism that makes $\\Gamma$ vanish at the specific angle of attack $\\alpha_{L=0}$ for a cambered airfoil.\n\nIn inviscid potential flow with a sharp trailing edge, the circulation is not arbitrary; it is selected by the Kutta condition, which requires that the flow leaves the sharp trailing edge smoothly (trailing-edge stagnation point located at the edge, finite velocity there). For any given geometric angle of attack $\\alpha$ and camber-line geometry, imposing the Kutta condition uniquely fixes $\\Gamma$. In thin airfoil theory, the result is the linear relation\n$$c_{l}=2\\pi\\left(\\alpha-\\alpha_{L=0}\\right),$$\nwhere $c_{l}$ is the lift coefficient, $\\alpha$ is the geometric angle of attack, and $\\alpha_{L=0}$ depends solely on the camber-line slope distribution. Using $c_{l}=\\frac{L'}{\\frac{1}{2}\\rho_{\\infty}U_{\\infty}^{2}c}$ and $L'=\\rho_{\\infty}U_{\\infty}\\Gamma$, one obtains\n$$\\Gamma=\\frac{1}{2}U_{\\infty}c\\,c_{l}.$$\nHence, at $\\alpha=\\alpha_{L=0}$, one has $c_{l}=0$ and thus $\\Gamma=0$. The vanishing of $\\Gamma$ at this angle is therefore a direct consequence of the Kutta condition selecting the unique circulation consistent with smooth flow off the trailing edge; at this particular orientation that unique value happens to be zero.\n\nNow assess the options:\n\n- A is incorrect because zero net lift requires the chordwise integral of the pressure difference to vanish, not pointwise equality. One can have nonzero local pressure differences that integrate to zero; thus local velocities on upper and lower surfaces need not be identical everywhere, even when $\\Gamma=0$.\n\n- B is incorrect because for a cambered airfoil $\\alpha_{L=0}$ is generally not zero; the freestream being parallel to the chord does not ensure zero lift for cambered shapes. The zero-lift angle is set by camber through the Kutta-conditioned solution, not by simple alignment.\n\n- C is correct: the Kutta condition uniquely determines $\\Gamma$ for each $\\alpha$; at $\\alpha_{L=0}$ that unique value is $\\Gamma=0$.\n\n- D is incorrect because appealing to total circulation conservation and absence of shed vortices is not the mechanism that fixes the bound circulation in steady flow about an airfoil. The selection of $\\Gamma$ arises from the Kutta condition at the trailing edge, not from a requirement that the wake contain no vortices.\n\n- E is incorrect because attached flow does not imply zero circulation; many attached flows have nonzero lift and circulation. Attachment is not the mechanism that sets $\\Gamma=0$.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate physical justification is that the Kutta condition uniquely selects the circulation, and at $\\alpha_{L=0}$ that selected circulation is zero, corresponding to option C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1801113"}, {"introduction": "The concept of circulation offers a macroscopic, elegant way to quantify lift, but lift itself is fundamentally a force caused by pressure differences. This exercise bridges these two perspectives by tasking you to derive lift from first principles—integrating the pressure distribution over a surface—and comparing it to the lift calculated via a circulation model. Through this process, using a simplified velocity field and Bernoulli's principle, you can see how the abstract idea of circulation is directly tied to the integrated effect of the fluid's velocity and pressure acting on the body's surface.
