The fluid enters with a total mass flow rate $\\dot{m}$ and has a velocity that is purely directed along the axis of rotation, meaning it has no angular momentum upon entry. The fluid then splits into two equal streams, flowing outwards along the two halves of the base section. At each end of the base, a distance $L$ from the axis, the fluid makes a smooth 90-degree turn and flows along one of the parallel arms. The arms are oriented to be parallel to the axis of rotation. The fluid from both arms exits into the surrounding environment.\n\nAssuming the flow process is steady with respect to the rotating tube and that frictional effects are negligible, determine the magnitude of the external torque required to maintain the tube's constant angular velocity.
