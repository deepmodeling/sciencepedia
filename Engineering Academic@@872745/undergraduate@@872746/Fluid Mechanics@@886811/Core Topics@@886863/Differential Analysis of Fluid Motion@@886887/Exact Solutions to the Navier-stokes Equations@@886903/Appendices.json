This exercise is a fantastic opportunity to see how modifying a single boundary condition can significantly alter a flow profile and to appreciate how classical solutions can be adapted to model more complex and modern physical phenomena.", "problem": "In the design of modern microfluidic devices, surface effects can become dominant, and the traditional no-slip boundary condition might not accurately describe the fluid behavior at a solid-liquid interface. A more realistic model for fluid flow over certain specially treated or superhydrophobic surfaces is the Navier slip condition, where the fluid velocity at the wall is proportional to the local shear stress.\n\nConsider the steady, laminar flow of an incompressible fluid with constant dynamic viscosity $\\mu$ between two infinite, stationary, parallel plates separated by a distance $H$. The flow is driven by a constant, favorable pressure gradient, $\\frac{dp}{dx} = -G$, where $G$ is a positive constant.\n\nA Cartesian coordinate system is set up such that the plates are normal to the $y$-axis, with the bottom plate at $y=0$ and the top plate at $y=H$.
