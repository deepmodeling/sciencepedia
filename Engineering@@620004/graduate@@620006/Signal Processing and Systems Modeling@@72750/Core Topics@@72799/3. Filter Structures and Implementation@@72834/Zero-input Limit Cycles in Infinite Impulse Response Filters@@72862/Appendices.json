It describes a standard scenario of quantization-induced limit cycles in digital signal processing. All parameters and definitions are provided, forming a complete and consistent problem statement. There are no violations of fundamental principles, logical contradictions, or ambiguities. The problem is valid.\n\nWe now proceed to the solution. The recursive relation for the filter output is given by\n$$y[n] = Q(a\\,y[n-1])$$\nwhere the quantizer $Q(\\cdot)$ maps its input to the nearest integer multiple of the step size $\\Delta$. This implies that the output sequence $y[n]$ can only take values from the set $\\{k\\Delta \\mid k \\in \\mathbb{Z}\\}$.\n\nIt is convenient to analyze the system in terms of an integer-valued sequence $k[n]$ defined as $y[n] = k[n] \\Delta$. Substituting this into the system equation, we find:\n$$k[n]\\Delta = Q(a \\cdot k[n-1]\\Delta)$$\nUsing the definition of the quantizer $Q(x) = \\Delta \\cdot \\operatorname{round}_{\\mathrm{even}}(x/\\Delta)$, we have\n$$k[n]\\Delta = \\Delta \\cdot \\operatorname{round}_{\\mathrm{even}}\\!\\left(\\frac{a \\cdot k[n-1]\\Delta}{\\Delta}\\right)$$\nDividing by $\\Delta$ (since $\\Delta = 2^{-10} \\ne 0$), we obtain the recurrence relation for the integer sequence $k[n]$:\n$$k[n] = \\operatorname{round}_{\\mathrm{even}}\\!\\big(a \\cdot k[n-1]\\big)$$\nThe initial condition is $y[-1] = 3\\Delta$, which corresponds to an initial integer state of $k[-1] = 3$.

We denote one period of this orbit as $\\{y_{\\infty}[k]\\}_{k=0}^{P-1}$.
