The final answer for the impulse response $h[n]$ must be expressed in closed form using the unit step sequence $u[n]$.\n\nStep 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\nThe problem is scientifically grounded, being a canonical problem in digital signal processing. It is well-posed because the transfer function $H(z)$ combined with a specified region of convergence (ROC) uniquely determines the impulse response $h[n]$. The problem is objective and uses precise mathematical language. There are no contradictions, missing information, or violations of physical or mathematical principles. The constraint to derive the solution from first principles is a pedagogical requirement, not a flaw; it ensures that a fundamental understanding is demonstrated, rather than rote application of a formula.\n\nStep 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. I will now proceed with a rigorous derivation.\n\nThe task is to find the impulse response $h[n]$ corresponding to the given transfer function $H(z)$ and its ROC. The impulse response is the inverse $z$-transform of the transfer function, $h[n] = \\mathcal{Z}^{-1}\\{H(z)\\}$.\n\nThe transfer function $H(z)$ is a rational function of $z^{-1}$. A direct inversion from its current form is not straightforward. We must first decompose $H(z)$ into a sum of simpler terms using partial fraction expansion. Let us write $H(z)$ as:\n$$ H(z) = \\frac{A}{1-0.8\\,z^{-1}} + \\frac{B}{1-0.5\\,z^{-1}} $$\nTo find the coefficient $A$, we can use the cover-up method. Multiply both sides by $(1-0.8\\,z^{-1})$ and evaluate at the value of $z^{-1}$ that makes this term zero, which is $z^{-1} = 1/0.8$.\n$$ A = \\left. \\frac{1}{1-0.5\\,z^{-1}} \\right|_{z^{-1}=1/0.8} = \\frac{1}{1-0.5 \\cdot \\frac{1}{0.8}} = \\frac{1}{1 - \\frac{1/2}{4/5}} = \\frac{1}{1 - \\frac{5}{8}} = \\frac{1}{3/8} = \\frac{8}{3} $$\nSimilarly, to find the coefficient $B$, we multiply by $(1-0.5\\,z^{-1})$ and evaluate at $z^{-1} = 1/0.5 = 2$.\n$$ B = \\left. \\frac{1}{1-0.8\\,z^{-1}} \\right|_{z^{-1}=2} = \\frac{1}{1-0.8 \\cdot 2} = \\frac{1}{1-1.6} = \\frac{1}{-0.6} = \\frac{1}{-3/5} = -\\frac{5}{3} $$\nThus, the partial fraction expansion of $H(z)$ is:\n$$ H(z) = \\frac{8/3}{1-0.8\\,z^{-1}} - \\frac{5/3}{1-0.5\\,z^{-1}} $$\nBy the linearity of the $z$-transform, the inverse transform of the sum is the sum of the inverse transforms:\n$$ h[n] = \\mathcal{Z}^{-1}\\{H(z)\\} = \\frac{8}{3}\\mathcal{Z}^{-1}\\left\\{\\frac{1}{1-0.8\\,z^{-1}}\\right\\} - \\frac{5}{3}\\mathcal{Z}^{-1}\\left\\{\\frac{1}{1-0.5\\,z^{-1}}\\right\\} $$\nWe must now find the inverse transform of each term based on first principles. Consider a generic term of the form $\\frac{1}{1-a z^{-1}}$. We rely on the formula for the sum of a geometric series: $\\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} r^k = \\frac{1}{1-r}$, which converges for $|r|1$.\n\nLet us analyze the transform pair for a right-sided exponential sequence $x[n] = a^n u[n]$. The unit step function $u[n]$ is defined as $1$ for $n \\ge 0$ and $0$ for $n  0$. The $z$-transform is:\n$$ \\mathcal{Z}\\{a^n u[n]\\} = \\sum_{n=-\\infty}^{\\infty} (a^n u[n]) z^{-n} = \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} a^n z^{-n} = \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} (a z^{-1})^n $$\nThis is a geometric series with ratio $r = a z^{-1}$. The series converges if and only if $|a z^{-1}|  1$, which is equivalent to $|z|  |a|$. When it converges, its sum is $\\frac{1}{1 - a z^{-1}}$. Therefore, we have the fundamental transform pair for a right-sided sequence:\n$$ \\mathcal{Z}\\{a^n u[n]\\} = \\frac{1}{1 - a z^{-1}}, \\quad \\text{ROC: } |z|  |a| $$\nThe problem specifies the overall ROC as $|z|0.8$. This region is exterior to a circle of radius $0.8$.\nFor the first term, $\\frac{1}{1-0.8\\,z^{-1}}$, the pole is at $z=0.8$. The given ROC, $|z|0.8$, corresponds to the region outside this pole. This matches the condition for a right-sided sequence with $a=0.8$. Consequently,\n$$ \\mathcal{Z}^{-1}\\left\\{\\frac{1}{1-0.8\\,z^{-1}}\\right\\} = (0.8)^n u[n] $$\nFor the second term, $\\frac{1}{1-0.5\\,z^{-1}}$, the pole is at $z=0.5$. The overall ROC $|z|0.8$ inherently satisfies the condition $|z|0.5$. This also corresponds to a right-sided sequence, with $a=0.5$. Thus,\n$$ \\mathcal{Z}^{-1}\\left\\{\\frac{1}{1-0.5\\,z^{-1}}\\right\\} = (0.5)^n u[n] $$\nCombining these results using linearity, we obtain the impulse response $h[n]$:\n$$ h[n] = \\frac{8}{3}(0.8)^n u[n] - \\frac{5}{3}(0.5)^n u[n] $$\nThis can be written more compactly as:\n$$ h[n] = \\left( \\frac{8}{3}(0.8)^n - \\frac{5}{3}(0.5)^n \\right) u[n] $$\nFinally, we must confirm that the resulting $h[n]$ is a right-sided sequence. A sequence $x[n]$ is defined as right-sided if there exists an integer $N_1$ such that $x[n]=0$ for all $nN_1$. In our derived expression for $h[n]$, the presence of the unit step function $u[n]$ ensures that $h[n]=0$ for all $n0$. This satisfies the definition of a right-sided sequence (specifically, a causal sequence, which is a subset of right-sided sequences). This result is consistent with the general principle that a rational transfer function with an ROC of the form $|z|  r_{\\text{max}}$, where $r_{\\text{max}}$ is the magnitude of the outermost pole, corresponds to a causal impulse response. Here, the outermost pole is at $z=0.8$, and the ROC is correctly given as $|z|0.8$.

If any eigenvalue has a magnitude greater than $1$, the system is internally unstable.\n3.  **Input-Output Stability:** A common definition of Bounded-Input Bounded-Output (BIBO) stability requires all poles of the transfer function $H(z)$ to lie strictly inside the unit circle. The problem specifies a related but weaker condition: the frequency response $H(e^{j\\omega})$ must exist and be bounded for all $\\omega \\in \\mathbb{R}$. This implies that $H(z)$ has no poles on the unit circle $|z|=1$.\n4.  **Pole-Zero Cancellation:** The poles of $H(z)$ are a subset of the eigenvalues of $A$. An eigenvalue of $A$ fails to be a pole of $H(z)$ if it is \"cancelled.\" This cancellation occurs if the mode associated with that eigenvalue is either uncontrollable or unobservable. A realization is called \"minimal\" if all its modes are both controllable and observable. In non-minimal realizations, pole-zero cancellations can occur.\n5.  **State Response:** For zero initial conditions ($x[0]=0$) and an impulse input ($u[k]=\\delta[k]$), the state vector evolves as $x[k] = A^{k-1}B$ for $k \\ge 1$. The state diverges if $\\|x[k]\\| \\to \\infty$ as $k \\to \\infty$. This occurs if an unstable mode (an eigenvalue $\\lambda$ with $|\\lambda|1$) is excited by the input.\n\nThe central issue is that an internally unstable system (having an eigenvalue $|\\lambda| > 1$) can appear stable from an input-output perspective if the unstable mode is unobservable or uncontrollable, leading to a pole-zero cancellation in $H(z)$.\n\nWe now evaluate each option.\n\n**Option A**\n\n- **(i) Explanation:** \"Exact pole-zero cancellation can hide unstable internal dynamics in non-minimal realizations because the canceled pole corresponds to an unobservable or uncontrollable mode with respect to the input-output map. BIBO stability depends only on $H(z)$, not on modes that have been canceled from the input-output perspective.\" This explanation is a correct and precise statement of fact in linear systems theory. A non-minimal realization contains modes that do not affect the input-output relationship, and if such a mode is unstable, internal instability is \"hidden\" from the transfer function.\n- **(ii) Realization:**\n    $A=\\begin{bmatrix} p  0 \\\\ 1  0 \\end{bmatrix},\\ B=\\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{bmatrix},\\ C=\\begin{bmatrix} 1  -p \\end{bmatrix},\\ D=0,$ with $|p|1$.\n    - **Internal Stability:** The characteristic polynomial is $\\det(zI-A) = \\det\\begin{pmatrix} z-p  0 \\\\ -1  z \\end{pmatrix} = z(z-p) = 0$. The eigenvalues are $\\lambda_1 = p$ and $\\lambda_2 = 0$. Since $|p|1$, the system is internally unstable.\n    - **Transfer Function:**\n    $$ H(z) = C(zI-A)^{-1}B = \\begin{bmatrix} 1  -p \\end{bmatrix} \\frac{1}{z(z-p)} \\begin{bmatrix} z  0 \\\\ 1  z-p \\end{bmatrix} \\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{bmatrix} $$\n    $$ H(z) = \\frac{1}{z(z-p)} \\begin{bmatrix} 1  -p \\end{bmatrix} \\begin{bmatrix} z \\\\ 1 \\end{bmatrix} = \\frac{z-p}{z(z-p)} = \\frac{1}{z} $$\n    A pole-zero cancellation at $z=p$ has occurred. The resulting $H(z) = 1/z$ has its only pole at $z=0$, which is inside the unit circle. The frequency response is $H(e^{j\\omega}) = e^{-j\\omega}$, which has a constant magnitude of $1$ and is therefore bounded for all $\\omega$.\n    - **State Divergence:** For $u[k]=\\delta[k]$ and $x[0]=0$, the state is $x[k] = A^{k-1}B$ for $k \\ge 1$.\n    $x[1] = B = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{bmatrix}$.\n    $x[2] = AB = \\begin{bmatrix} p  0 \\\\ 1  0 \\end{bmatrix} \\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} p \\\\ 1 \\end{bmatrix}$.\n    $x[3] = A^2B = \\begin{bmatrix} p  0 \\\\ 1  0 \\end{bmatrix} \\begin{bmatrix} p \\\\ 1 \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} p^2 \\\\ p \\end{bmatrix}$.\n    By induction, for $k \\ge 2$, $x[k] = \\begin{bmatrix} p^{k-1} \\\\ p^{k-2} \\end{bmatrix}$. Since $|p|1$, $\\|x[k]\\|$ grows without bound as $k \\to \\infty$. The state diverges.\n- **Verdict for A:** The explanation is correct, and the provided realization satisfies all conditions: it is internally unstable, its frequency response is bounded, and its state diverges for the given impulse input, perfectly demonstrating how pole-zero cancellation masks internal instability. **Correct**.\n\n**Option B**\n\n- **(i) Explanation:** \"If $H(z)$ simplifies by exact pole-zero cancellation to a transfer function without poles outside the unit circle, then every realization that implements it must be internally stable; internal instability cannot occur when $H(e^{j\\omega})$ is bounded.\" This statement is fundamentally incorrect. It claims that input-output stability implies internal stability, which is false. The existence of a single counterexample is sufficient to disprove this general statement.\n- **(ii) Realization:** The option claims that \"no counterexample exists.\" Option A provides precisely such a counterexample.\n- **Verdict for B:** The explanation is false. **Incorrect**.\n\n**Option C**\n\n- **(i) Explanation:** \"Exact pole-zero cancellation can hide unstable internal dynamics, but only if the unstable mode is directly driven by the input.\" The phrasing \"directly driven by the input\" corresponds to the concept of controllability. For the state to diverge from $x[0]=0$, the unstable mode must indeed be controllable (excited by the input). However, the example provided contradicts this.\n- **(ii) Realization:**\n    $A=\\begin{bmatrix} p  0 \\\\ 0  0 \\end{bmatrix},\\ B=\\begin{bmatrix} 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{bmatrix},\\ C=\\begin{bmatrix} 1  0 \\end{bmatrix},\\ D=0,$ with $|p|1$.\n    - **Internal Stability:** The eigenvalues of the diagonal matrix $A$ are $\\lambda_1 = p$ and $\\lambda_2 = 0$. Since $|p|1$, the system is internally unstable.\n    - **Transfer Function:**\n    $$ H(z) = \\begin{bmatrix} 1  0 \\end{bmatrix} \\begin{bmatrix} (z-p)^{-1}  0 \\\\ 0  z^{-1} \\end{bmatrix} \\begin{bmatrix} 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} 1  0 \\end{bmatrix} \\begin{bmatrix} 0 \\\\ z^{-1} \\end{bmatrix} = 0 $$\n    The frequency response is $H(e^{j\\omega}) = 0$, which is bounded.\n    - **State Divergence:** For $u[k]=\\delta[k]$ and $x[0]=0$, the state evolves as $x_1[k+1] = px_1[k]$ and $x_2[k+1] = u[k]$.\n    $x[0] = \\begin{bmatrix} 0 \\\\ 0 \\end{bmatrix}$.\n    $x_1[0]=0$, so $x_1[k]=0$ for all $k \\ge 0$. The unstable mode is not excited.\n    $x_2$ evolves as: $x_2[1] = u[0]=1$, $x_2[k]=0$ for $k \\ge 2$.\n    The state sequence is $x[0]=\\begin{bmatrix}0\\\\0\\end{bmatrix}, x[1]=\\begin{bmatrix}0\\\\1\\end{bmatrix}, x[k]=\\begin{bmatrix}0\\\\0\\end{bmatrix}$ for $k \\ge 2$.\n    The state does not diverge; it is bounded. The unstable mode associated with $p$ is uncontrollable.\n- **Verdict for C:** The realization fails to meet the criterion of a diverging state. **Incorrect**.\n\n**Option D**\n\n- **(i) Explanation:** \"Exact pole-zero cancellation does not affect internal stability...\" This part is trivially true, as internal stability depends only on matrix $A$. However, the explanation then fails to correctly link pole-zero cancellation to the phenomenon of a stable transfer function from an unstable system. It treats them as separate issues, which is misleading. Pole-zero cancellation is the very mechanism that \"masks\" the instability in the transfer function.\n- **(ii) Realization:**\n    $A=\\begin{bmatrix} p  0 \\\\ 1  0 \\end{bmatrix},\\ B=\\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{bmatrix},\\ C=\\begin{bmatrix} 1  0 \\end{bmatrix},\\ D=0,$ with $|p|1$.\n    - **Internal Stability:** Same $A$ as in Option A. Eigenvalues are $p$ and $0$. The system is internally unstable.\n    - **Transfer Function:**\n    $$ H(z) = C(zI-A)^{-1}B = \\begin{bmatrix} 1  0 \\end{bmatrix} \\frac{1}{z(z-p)} \\begin{bmatrix} z  0 \\\\ 1  z-p \\end{bmatrix} \\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{bmatrix} $$\n    $$ H(z) = \\frac{1}{z(z-p)} \\begin{bmatrix} 1  0 \\end{bmatrix} \\begin{bmatrix} z \\\\ 1 \\end{bmatrix} = \\frac{z}{z(z-p)} = \\frac{1}{z-p} $$\n    There is no cancellation of the unstable pole at $z=p$. The pole associated with the unstable eigenvalue $p$ is present in the transfer function. The system is BIBO unstable.\n    - **Frequency Response:** $H(e^{j\\omega})=\\frac{1}{e^{j\\omega}-p}$. Since $|e^{j\\omega}|=1$ and $|p|1$, the denominator is never zero. The magnitude is $|H(e^{j\\omega})|=\\frac{1}{|e^{j\\omega}-p|} \\le \\frac{1}{|p|-1}$, so it is bounded.\n    - **State Divergence:** The matrices $A$ and $B$ are identical to those in Option A. As shown previously, the state $x[k]$ diverges.\n    - **Analysis:** Although this realization is internally unstable, has a bounded frequency response, and a diverging state, it does **not** demonstrate the principle of *masking* instability via pole-zero cancellation. The unstable mode at $z=p$ is fully visible as a pole in $H(z)$. Therefore, the example is irrelevant to the central claim about pole-zero cancellation hiding instability.\n- **Verdict for D:** The explanation is poor, and the provided realization does not exhibit the phenomenon of pole-zero cancellation masking an unstable mode, which is the core concept under discussion. **Incorrect**.\n\nBased on the analysis, only Option A provides both a correct theoretical explanation and a valid, illustrative example.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2891641"}]}
