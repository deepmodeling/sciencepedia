This hands-on process of reducing nested feedback loops and combining parallel paths is essential for deriving the effective transfer function that governs the system's behavior [@problem_id:2690586].", "problem": "Consider a single-input single-output negative-feedback control system composed of linear time-invariant (LTI) subsystems in the Laplace domain. Let the reference be $R(s)$, the output be $Y(s)$, and the outer-loop sensor be $H(s)$, combined at a summing junction forming the error signal $E(s)$ by $E(s) = R(s) - H(s) Y(s)$. The forward network inside the loop comprises two parallel branches that share the common error input $E(s)$ and contribute additively to the output $Y(s)$. The branches are described as follows.\n\nBranch 1: The error $E(s)$ is first processed by a prefilter $A_{1}(s)$ to produce $U_{1}(s)$. At an internal summing junction, a local feedback signal is subtracted from $U_{1}(s)$ to produce $X_{1}(s)$. The local feedback signal is obtained by passing the branch internal output $Z_{1}(s)$ through a local sensor $K_{1}(s)$, so that $X_{1}(s) = U_{1}(s) - K_{1}(s) Z_{1}(s)$. The internal output is then $Z_{1}(s) = G_{1}(s) X_{1}(s)$, and the branch’s contribution to the plant output is $Y_{1}(s) = B_{1}(s) Z_{1}(s)$.\n\nBranch 2: Analogously, the error $E(s)$ is processed by $A_{2}(s)$ to produce $U_{2}(s)$; a local feedback from $Z_{2}(s)$ through $K_{2}(s)$ forms $X_{2}(s) = U_{2}(s) - K_{2}(s) Z_{2}(s)$; the internal output is $Z_{2}(s) = G_{2}(s) X_{2}(s)$; and the branch contribution to the plant output is $Y_{2}(s) = B_{2}(s) Z_{2}(s)$.\n\nThe plant output is the sum of the branch outputs, $Y(s) = Y_{1}(s) + Y_{2}(s)$. All transfer functions $A_{i}(s)$, $B_{i}(s)$, $G_{i}(s)$, $K_{i}(s)$ for $i \\in \\{1,2\\}$, and $H(s)$ are proper rational functions of $s$, and all summing operations are linear.\n\nUsing only the definitions of signals, linearity, and the algebra of summing junctions and series/parallel interconnections in the Laplace domain, derive the effective forward transfer function $F_{\\mathrm{eq}}(s)$ seen by the outer loop, defined as $F_{\\mathrm{eq}}(s) \\equiv \\dfrac{Y(s)}{E(s)}$ when treating $H(s)$ as part of the feedback path. Express your final answer as a single closed-form analytic expression in terms of $A_{1}(s)$, $B_{1}(s)$, $G_{1}(s)$, $K_{1}(s)$, $A_{2}(s)$, $B_{2}(s)$, $G_{2}(s)$, and $K_{2}(s)$. No numerical evaluation is required, and no rounding is needed. The final expression must be simplified so that it contains no internal signals.", "solution": "We start from the foundational representation of linear time-invariant (LTI) systems in the Laplace domain, where interconnections are expressed by algebraic equations among Laplace-transformed signals. Series interconnections correspond to multiplicative transfer functions, parallel interconnections correspond to additive outputs, and feedback interconnections are expressed by subtractive summing junctions that algebraically relate signals.\n\nDefine the error signal by the outer summing junction as $E(s) = R(s) - H(s) Y(s)$. To derive the forward transfer seen by the outer loop, we treat $E(s)$ as the input to the forward network and $Y(s)$ as its output, without closing the outer loop (that is, we refrain from substituting $E(s)$ into this equation and instead compute $Y(s)$ as a function of $E(s)$).\n\nWe now write the signal equations for each branch using only summation and series relations.\n\nBranch 1:\n1.

The forward element gives $Z_{1}(s) = G_{1}(s) X_{1}(s)$.\n4. The branch output contribution to the plant output is $Y_{1}(s) = B_{1}(s) Z_{1}(s)$.\n\nWe eliminate internal signals $U_{1}(s)$ and $X_{1}(s)$ to express $Z_{1}(s)$ directly in terms of $E(s)$.

The two interconnections possess identical closed-loop transfer functions from reference $r$ to output $y$.\n\nTask 2: Derivation of the transfer function from $r$ to $u$.\nThe plant input $U(s)$ is related to the error signal $E(s)$ by $U(s) = C(s)E(s)$. The error signal is $E(s) = R(s) - Y(s)$. Substituting $Y(s) = T(s)R(s)$, we get $E(s) = R(s) - T(s)R(s) = (1 - T(s))R(s)$.\nTherefore, $U(s) = C(s)(1 - T(s))R(s)$.\nThe transfer function from $r$ to $u$ is $T_{ru}(s) = \\frac{U(s)}{R(s)} = C(s)(1 - T(s))$.\nAn alternative, more direct derivation starts from $E(s) = \\frac{R(s)}{1+C(s)P(s)}$. Since $U(s) = C(s)E(s)$, it follows that:\n$$T_{ru}(s) = \\frac{U(s)}{R(s)} = \\frac{C(s)}{1 + C(s)P(s)}$$\n\nFor Interconnection A:\n$$T_{ru, A}(s) = \\frac{C_{A}(s)}{1 + L_{A}(s)} = \\frac{4 \\frac{s + 2}{s - 2}}{1 + 4} = \\frac{4}{5} \\frac{s + 2}{s - 2}$$\nThe pole set of $T_{ru, A}(s)$ is the set of values of $s$ for which the denominator is zero. The only pole is at $s = 2$. Pole set: $\\{2\\}$.\n\nFor Interconnection B:\n$$T_{ru, B}(s) = \\frac{C_{B}(s)}{1 + L_{B}(s)} = \\frac{4}{1 + 4} = \\frac{4}{5}$$\nThis transfer function is a constant and has no finite poles. Its pole set is the empty set $\\emptyset$.\n\nTask 3: Internal stability analysis.\nAn interconnection is defined as internally stable if and only if every transfer function between well-posed internal signals is stable. A transfer function is stable if all its poles lie in the open left-half of the complex plane ($\\text{Re}(s)  0$). We must examine the transfer functions from the external input $r$ to the internal signals, such as the error $e$, the plant input $u$, and the output $y$.\n\nFor Interconnection A:\nWe have already found one internal transfer function:\n$$T_{ru, A}(s) = \\frac{4(s + 2)}{5(s - 2)}$$\nThis transfer function has a pole at $s = 2$. Since this pole is in the right-half plane (RHP), this transfer function is unstable. According to the provided definition, the existence of even one unstable internal transfer function is sufficient to declare the entire system internally unstable.\nTherefore, Interconnection A is internally unstable.\n\nFor Interconnection B:\nThe plant and controller are $P_B(s) = 1$ and $C_B(s) = 4$. Both are stable. The closed-loop characteristic polynomial is $1 + C_B(s)P_B(s) = 5$, which has no roots. Thus, there are no closed-loop poles. We examine the key internal transfer functions:\n- $T_{ry, B}(s) = T_{B}(s) = \\frac{4}{5}$ (Stable)\n- $T_{ru, B}(s) = \\frac{4}{5}$ (Stable)\n- $T_{re, B}(s) = \\frac{E(s)}{R(s)} = \\frac{1}{1 + L_B(s)} = \\frac{1}{5}$ (Stable)\nAll other internal transfer functions (e.g., from disturbances at the plant input or output to any internal signal) will also be constants, as no dynamics exist within the system blocks. Since all possible internal transfer functions are stable, Interconnection B is internally stable.\n\nExplanation of the difference:\nThe two interconnections have identical input-output transfer functions $T(s)$ due to a phenomenon known as unstable pole-zero cancellation in Interconnection A. The controller $C_{A}(s)$ has an unstable pole at $s = 2$, and the plant $P_{A}(s)$ has a non-minimum phase zero at the same location $s = 2$. In the product $C_{A}(s)P_{A}(s)$, these terms cancel algebraically: $(s-2)/(s-2) = 1$ for $s \\neq 2$. This cancellation makes the unstable mode associated with the pole at $s=2$ unobservable from the output $y$ when the input is $r$.\nHowever, this unstable mode is not eliminated from the system; it is merely hidden from the input-output map. The signal $u(t)$ is generated by the controller $C_A(s)$, which is itself unstable. The transfer function $T_{ru, A}(s)$ reflects this, as its pole at $s=2$ is inherited from $C_A(s)$. Any non-zero initial condition or disturbance can excite this unstable mode, causing the internal signal $u(t)$ to grow without bounds, e.g., as $k \\exp(2t)$, even if the output $y(t)$ remains bounded. Physical actuators driven by $u(t)$ would saturate or fail. This condition is the definition of internal instability.\nInterconnection B has no such cancellations and all its components are stable, leading to an internally stable system.\n\nTask 4: Computation of the stability score S.\nThe stability score $S$ is defined as $S = 1$ if and only if the internally stable interconnection is Interconnection B, and $S = 0$ otherwise.\nFrom the analysis in Task 3, we have determined that Interconnection B is internally stable and Interconnection A is internally unstable.\nTherefore, the condition \"the internally stable interconnection is Interconnection B\" is true.\nThis yields $S = 1$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{1}$$", "id": "2909087"}]}
