It is well-posed, with all necessary definitions and data provided to determine a unique solution for the indicators $c$ and $s$. The language is objective and precise. The problem is a standard exercise in determining system properties from the impulse response and is free of any conceptual or logical flaws.\n\n**Conclusion:** The problem is valid. We will proceed with a solution derived from first principles as demanded.\n\n**Causality Analysis**\nAn LTI system is defined as causal if and only if its impulse response $h(t)$ is zero for all negative time, i.e., $h(t)=0$ for all $t < 0$. We must examine the given impulse response $h(t)=\\exp(-t)\\,u(t)+2\\,\\exp(t)\\,u(-t)$ for $t < 0$.\n\nThe unit step function $u(t)$ is defined as $u(t)=0$ for $t < 0$. Consequently, the first term, $\\exp(-t)\\,u(t)$, is equal to $0$ for all $t < 0$.\n\nThe function $u(-t)$ is defined by the behavior of its argument. Based on the definition of $u(t)$:\n- $u(-t) = 1$ if $-t \\ge 0$, which is equivalent to $t \\le 0$.\n- $u(-t) = 0$ if $-t < 0$, which is equivalent to $t > 0$.\n\nFor any $t < 0$, we have $u(t)=0$ and $u(-t)=1$. Substituting these into the expression for $h(t)$:\n$$h(t) = \\exp(-t) \\cdot 0 + 2\\,\\exp(t) \\cdot 1 = 2\\,\\exp(t) \\quad \\text{for } t < 0$$\nSince $\\exp(t)$ is strictly positive for all real $t$, the term $2\\,\\exp(t)$ is non-zero for $t < 0$. For instance, at $t=-1$, $h(-1)=2\\,\\exp(-1) \\ne 0$. The condition $h(t)=0$ for all $t<0$ is violated.\nTherefore, the system is not causal. The causality indicator is $c=0$.\n\n**Bounded-Input Bounded-Output (BIBO) Stability Analysis**\nAn LTI system is defined as BIBO stable if and only if its impulse response $h(t)$ is absolutely integrable, meaning the following condition holds:\n$$\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} |h(t)| \\, dt < \\infty$$\nWe must evaluate this integral for the given $h(t)$. The function $h(t)$ can be expressed piecewise:\n- For $t > 0$: $u(t)=1$ and $u(-t)=0$. Thus, $h(t)=\\exp(-t)$.\n- For $t < 0$: $u(t)=0$ and $u(-t)=1$. Thus, $h(t)=2\\,\\exp(t)$.\n- For $t = 0$: $u(0)=1$ and $u(-0)=1$. Thus, $h(0)=\\exp(0)+2\\,\\exp(0)=1+2=3$.\n\nThe integral can be split at $t=0$:\n$$\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} |h(t)| \\, dt = \\int_{-\\infty}^{0} |h(t)| \\, dt + \\int_{0}^{\\infty} |h(t)| \\, dt$$\nNote that the value at the single point $t=0$ does not affect the value of the definite integral.\n\nFor the interval $(-\\infty, 0)$, $h(t) = 2\\,\\exp(t)$. Since $\\exp(t) > 0$ for all $t$, $|h(t)|=2\\,\\exp(t)$.\n$$\\int_{-\\infty}^{0} |h(t)| \\, dt = \\int_{-\\infty}^{0} 2\\,\\exp(t) \\, dt = 2 \\left[ \\exp(t) \\right]_{-\\infty}^{0} = 2 (\\exp(0) - \\lim_{t\\to-\\infty} \\exp(t)) = 2(1-0) = 2$$\n\nFor the interval $(0, \\infty)$, $h(t) = \\exp(-t)$. Since $\\exp(-t) > 0$ for all $t$, $|h(t)|=\\exp(-t)$.\n$$\\int_{0}^{\\infty} |h(t)| \\, dt = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\exp(-t) \\, dt = \\left[ -\\exp(-t) \\right]_{0}^{\\infty} = - (\\lim_{t\\to\\infty} \\exp(-t) - \\exp(0)) = -(0-1) = 1$$\n\nThe total integral is the sum of the parts:\n$$\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} |h(t)| \\, dt = 2 + 1 = 3$$\nSince the integral evaluates to the finite value $3$, the system is absolutely integrable.\nTherefore, the system is BIBO stable. The stability indicator is $s=1$.\n\n**Final Calculation**\nThe problem requires the calculation of the scalar code $\\kappa = 10\\,s+c$.\nUsing the derived values $s=1$ and $c=0$:\n$$\\kappa = 10(1) + 0 = 10$$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{10}$$", "id": "2857380"}, {"introduction": "A stable transfer function is a desirable property, but does it guarantee that the underlying physical system is well-behaved? This exercise explores the critical distinction between external (input-output) stability and internal stability using a state-space representation [@problem_id:2857287].

By definition, bounded-input bounded-output (BIBO) stability for a continuous-time LTI system means that for every bounded input $u(t)$, the output $y(t)$ remains bounded for all $t \\ge 0$. A well-tested criterion for single-input single-output rational transfer functions is that BIBO stability holds if and only if all poles of $G(s)$ lie strictly in the open left half-plane.\n\nFrom the simplified expression,\n\n$$\nG(s)=\\frac{2s+3}{(s+1)(s+2)},\n$$\n\nthe poles are at $s=-1$ and $s=-2$, both strictly in the open left half-plane. Therefore, the input-output map is BIBO stable.\n\nInternal (asymptotic) stability for the state-space model is defined by the requirement that the homogeneous solution $\\dot{x}(t)=A x(t)$ satisfies $\\lim_{t\\to\\infty} x(t)=0$ for all initial conditions $x(0)$. A well-tested criterion is that this holds if and only if all eigenvalues of $A$ have strictly negative real parts. The eigenvalues of $A$ are read off the diagonal entries:\n\n$$\n\\lambda_{1}=-1,\\quad \\lambda_{2}=-2,\\quad \\lambda_{3}=1.\n$$\n\nSince $\\lambda_{3}=1$ has positive real part, the internal dynamics are unstable. In particular, the mode associated with the third state grows like $\\exp(t)$ for nonzero initial conditions along that mode.\n\nThis establishes the discrepancy: the system is BIBO stable as an input-output map but internally unstable as a state-space realization.\n\nStep 3: Identify the canceled unstable factor and non-minimality. The characteristic polynomial of $A$ is\n\n$$\n\\det(s I - A)=(s+1)(s+2)(s-1).\n$$\n\nYet the transfer function simplifies to have denominator $(s+1)(s+2)$, indicating that the factor $(s-1)$ associated with the unstable eigenvalue at $s=1$ is absent from the input-output map. In the state-space to transfer-function relation using\n\n$$\nG(s)=\\frac{C\\,\\operatorname{adj}(s I - A)\\,B + \\det(s I - A)\\,D}{\\det(s I - A)},\n$$\n\nany unobservable or uncontrollable mode produces a common factor between the numerator and denominator that cancels. Here, because the third state is neither actuated nor measured (the third entries of $B$ and $C$ are zero), the unstable factor $(s-1)$ cancels between numerator and denominator, yielding the reduced denominator $(s+1)(s+2)$. This exact cancellation signifies that the realization is non-minimal: it contains an internally unstable but unobservable and uncontrollable mode that does not appear in the input-output behavior.\n\nTherefore, the constructed realization satisfies the requirements: the transfer function is BIBO stable, the internal dynamics are unstable, and the unstable factor $(s-1)$ is canceled in the transfer function.

We begin by validating the problem and then proceed with the solution as requested. The problem as stated is scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and contains all necessary information for a unique solution. It is a standard problem in classical control theory.\n\nA continuous-time LTI system with a rational transfer function is BIBO stable if and only if all poles of its transfer function lie strictly in the open left half-plane of the complex $s$-plane, i.e., for any pole $p$, $\\text{Re}(p) < 0$. The Routh-Hurwitz stability criterion provides a method to determine whether all roots of a polynomial have negative real parts without explicitly computing the roots.\n\nFor a general real-coefficient polynomial, the characteristic equation, given by $P(s) = a_n s^n + a_{n-1} s^{n-1} + \\dots + a_1 s + a_0 = 0$, the Routh-Hurwitz test involves constructing a Routh array. The first two rows of the array are formed by the coefficients of the polynomial:\nRow $1$: $a_n, a_{n-2}, a_{n-4}, \\dots$\nRow $2$: $a_{n-1}, a_{n-3}, a_{n-5}, \\dots$\nSubsequent rows are computed based on the elements of the two preceding rows. For an element in row $i$ and column $j$, say $c_{i,j}$, located below elements $c_{i-2,j}$ and $c_{i-1,j}$, it is calculated using the first column elements $c_{i-2,1}$ and $c_{i-1,1}$ as:\n$c_{i,j} = \\frac{c_{i-1,1} c_{i-2,j+1} - c_{i-2,1} c_{i-1,j+1}}{c_{i-1,1}}$.\nThe Routh-Hurwitz criterion states that the number of roots of the polynomial with positive real parts is equal to the number of sign changes in the first column of the completed Routh array. For a system to be stable, all its characteristic poles must be in the left half-plane, which requires that all elements in the first column of the Routh array must be non-zero and have the same sign.\n\nNow, we apply this to the given system. The open-loop transfer function is $G(s) = \\frac{K(s+\\frac{12}{25})}{(s+1)(s+2)(s+3)(s+4)}$. For a unity-feedback loop, the closed-loop transfer function is $T(s) = \\frac{G(s)}{1+G(s)}$.
