It presents a standard exercise in the manipulation of block diagrams for linear time-invariant systems. The premises are consistent and sufficient for a unique solution. We may therefore proceed with the derivation.\n\nThe objective is to find a compensating transfer function, denoted by $K(s)$, that equates the outputs of two different system configurations. The first configuration is described by the output equation\n$$y_1(t) = G\\{u(t)\\} + v(t)$$\nwhere $G\\{\\cdot\\}$ is the time-domain operator corresponding to the transfer function $G(s)$, $u(t)$ is the reference input, and $v(t)$ is an additive output disturbance.\n\nThe second configuration moves the disturbance to the input side, resulting in an output equation\n$$y_2(t) = G\\{u(t) + \\hat{v}(t)\\}$$\nwhere the modified disturbance $\\hat{v}(t)$ is related to the original disturbance $v(t)$ via the compensator $K(s)$ such that their Laplace transforms satisfy $\\hat{V}(s) = K(s)V(s)$.\n\nFor the two configurations to be equivalent, their outputs must be identical for all admissible inputs $u(t)$ and disturbances $v(t)$. This means we must have $y_1(t) = y_2(t)$, which implies their Laplace transforms must also be equal, $Y_1(s) = Y_2(s)$.\n\nWe begin by finding the Laplace-domain representation for each configuration.\nFor the first configuration, applying the one-sided Laplace transform $\\mathcal{L}\\{\\cdot\\}$ to the output equation gives:\n$$Y_1(s) = \\mathcal{L}\\{G\\{u(t)\\} + v(t)\\}$$\nBy the linearity of the Laplace transform:\n$$Y_1(s) = \\mathcal{L}\\{G\\{u(t)\\}\\} + \\mathcal{L}\\{v(t)\\}$$\nGiven zero initial conditions, the output of the block $G(s)$ in the Laplace domain is the product of its transfer function and the Laplace transform of its input. Thus, $\\mathcal{L}\\{G\\{u(t)\\}\\} = G(s)U(s)$. The expression for the output is:\n$$Y_1(s) = G(s)U(s) + V(s)$$\n\nFor the second configuration, the input to the block $G(s)$ is $u(t) + \\hat{v}(t)$. Let this composite input be $w(t) = u(t) + \\hat{v}(t)$. The output is $y_2(t) = G\\{w(t)\\}$. In the Laplace domain, this becomes:\n$$Y_2(s) = G(s)W(s)$$\nwhere $W(s) = \\mathcal{L}\\{w(t)\\} = \\mathcal{L}\\{u(t) + \\hat{v}(t)\\}$. Using linearity again:\n$$W(s) = U(s) + \\hat{V}(s)$$\nSubstituting the definition of the compensator, $\\hat{V}(s) = K(s)V(s)$:\n$$W(s) = U(s) + K(s)V(s)$$\nThe output for the second configuration is therefore:\n$$Y_2(s) = G(s)\\left(U(s) + K(s)V(s)\\right) = G(s)U(s) + G(s)K(s)V(s)$$\n\nEquating the two output expressions, $Y_1(s) = Y_2(s)$:\n$$G(s)U(s) + V(s) = G(s)U(s) + G(s)K(s)V(s)$$\nThe term $G(s)U(s)$ cancels from both sides, leaving:\n$$V(s) = G(s)K(s)V(s)$$\nThis can be rearranged to $(1 - G(s)K(s))V(s) = 0$. As this equality must hold for any arbitrary disturbance $v(t)$ (and thus for any $V(s)$), the coefficient of $V(s)$ must be identically zero.\n$$1 - G(s)K(s) = 0$$\nFrom this, we solve for the compensating transfer function $K(s)$:\n$$K(s) = \\frac{1}{G(s)}$$\nThe compensator required to move an additive output disturbance to the input is the inverse of the system's transfer function.\n\nThe problem requires a derivation starting from the governing differential equation. The transfer function $G(s)$ is derived by applying the Laplace transform to the given differential equation:\n$$\\tau \\frac{d y(t)}{d t} + y(t) = k\\, x(t)$$\nApplying the Laplace transform on both sides yields:\n$$\\mathcal{L}\\left\\{\\tau \\frac{d y(t)}{d t} + y(t)\\right\\} = \\mathcal{L}\\{k\\, x(t)\\}$$\nUsing the linearity property and the differentiation property of the Laplace transform, $\\mathcal{L}\\{\\frac{dy}{dt}\\} = sY(s) - y(0)$:\n$$\\tau (sY(s) - y(0)) + Y(s) = kX(s)$$\nThe problem specifies zero initial conditions, so $y(0) = 0$. The equation simplifies to:\n$$\\tau sY(s) + Y(s) = kX(s)$$\nFactoring out $Y(s)$:\n$$Y(s)(\\tau s + 1) = kX(s)$$\nThe transfer function $G(s)$ is defined as the ratio of the output transform to the input transform, $G(s) = \\frac{Y(s)}{X(s)}$:\n$$G(s) = \\frac{k}{\\tau s + 1}$$\nThis confirms the expression given in the problem statement.\n\nNow we can find the explicit form of $K(s)$:\n$$K(s) = \\frac{1}{G(s)} = \\frac{1}{\\frac{k}{\\tau s + 1}} = \\frac{\\tau s + 1}{k}$$\nThis can also be written as $K(s) = \\frac{\\tau}{k}s + \\frac{1}{k}$.\n\nFinally, we must analyze the properties of this compensator.\n1.  **Nontriviality**: The compensator $K(s)$ would be trivial if it were a simple unity gain, $K(s) = 1$. This would require $\\frac{\\tau s + 1}{k} = 1$, which implies $\\tau s + 1 = k$. For this polynomial identity to hold, the coefficients of each power of $s$ must be equal. This gives $\\tau = 0$ and $1 = k$. However, the problem specifies $\\tau  0$, so the condition $\\tau=0$ is not met. Therefore, $K(s)$ is always a nontrivial compensator under the problem's constraints. More specifically, since $\\tau  0$ and $k \\neq 0$, $K(s)$ is a dynamic operator (frequency-dependent) and not a simple constant gain.\n\n2.  **Properness and Causal Implementability**: A transfer function $H(s) = \\frac{N(s)}{D(s)}$ is defined as **proper** if the degree of the numerator polynomial, $\\text{deg}(N(s))$, is less than or equal to the degree of the denominator polynomial, $\\text{deg}(D(s))$. A system is causally implementable as a linear time-invariant operator if and only if its transfer function is proper.\n    For our compensator, $K(s) = \\frac{\\tau s + 1}{k}$:\n    - The numerator polynomial is $N(s) = \\tau s + 1$. Since $\\tau  0$, its degree is $\\text{deg}(N(s)) = 1$.\n    - The denominator polynomial is $D(s) = k$. Since $k \\neq 0$, it is a non-zero constant, and its degree is $\\text{deg}(D(s)) = 0$.\n    Because $\\text{deg}(N(s)) = 1  \\text{deg}(D(s)) = 0$, the transfer function $K(s)$ is **improper**. An improper transfer function corresponds to a non-causal system, which cannot be implemented in real time because its output depends on future values of the input (in this case, it contains a pure differentiator term, $\\frac{\\tau}{k}s$).\n\n    The question asks for the conditions under which $K(s)$ would be proper. For $K(s)$ to be proper, we would require $\\text{deg}(N(s)) \\le \\text{deg}(D(s))$, which is $1 \\le 0$. This is impossible. The only way to satisfy the properness condition would be to reduce the degree of the numerator to $0$. This requires the coefficient of the highest power of $s$ in the numerator to be zero. The condition is thus $\\tau = 0$.\n    If we were to assume $\\tau = 0$, the original system becomes $y(t) = kx(t)$, a simple static gain with $G(s) = k$. The compensator would then be $K(s) = \\frac{1}{k}$, which is a constant. A constant gain is a proper transfer function ($\\text{deg}(N(s))=0, \\text{deg}(D(s))=0$) and is causally implementable.\n    In conclusion, under the strict given condition $\\tau  0$, the required compensator $K(s)$ is always improper and non-causal. The condition required for it to become proper and causally implementable is $\\tau = 0$, but this would fundamentally change the original system from dynamic to static.\nThe final required expression is for $K(s)$ as derived from the problem statement.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{\\tau s + 1}{k}}$$", "id": "2855704"}, {"introduction": "Stability is the foremost requirement for any feedback system, and block diagrams are our primary tool for its analysis.

Effective negative feedback occurs when an odd number of these are negative (e.g., $\\sigma=+1$, $k_c0$, $K_p0$). Effective positive feedback occurs when an even number (zero or two) are negative (e.g., $\\sigma=+1$, $k_c0$, $K_p0$).\n\nFor asymptotic stability, all closed-loop poles must lie in the open left half of the complex plane, which means their real parts must be strictly negative.

The equation becomes:\n$$\\tau \\frac{dy}{dt} + y = K, \\quad y(0)=0$$\nThis is a first-order linear non-homogeneous ordinary differential equation. The solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution, $y_h(t)$, and the particular solution, $y_p(t)$.\nThe homogeneous equation is $\\tau \\frac{dy_h}{dt} + y_h = 0$, which has the solution $y_h(t) = C \\exp(-t/\\tau)$ for some constant $C$.\nFor the particular solution, since the forcing term is a constant $K$, we assume a constant solution $y_p(t) = A$. Substituting this into the differential equation gives $\\tau(0) + A = K$, so $A=K$.\nThe general solution is $y(t) = y_h(t) + y_p(t) = C \\exp(-t/\\tau) + K$.\nTo find the constant $C$, we apply the initial condition $y(0)=0$:\n$$y(0) = C \\exp(0) + K = C+K = 0 \\implies C = -K$$\nThus, the unit-step response of the system is:\n$$y(t) = K - K \\exp(-t/\\tau) = K(1 - \\exp(-t/\\tau)), \\quad t \\ge 0$$\nThe final value, or steady-state value, of the output is:\n$$y_{ss} = \\lim_{t \\to \\infty} y(t) = \\lim_{t \\to \\infty} K(1 - \\exp(-t/\\tau)) = K$$\nThe $2\\%$-settling time, $t_s$, is defined as the time after which the output $y(t)$ remains within the range $[y_{ss} - 0.02 y_{ss}, y_{ss} + 0.02 y_{ss}]$, which is $[0.98 K, 1.02 K]$.\nSince $K0$ and $\\tau0$, the output $y(t)$ starts at $y(0)=0$ and increases monotonically towards its asymptote $K$.
