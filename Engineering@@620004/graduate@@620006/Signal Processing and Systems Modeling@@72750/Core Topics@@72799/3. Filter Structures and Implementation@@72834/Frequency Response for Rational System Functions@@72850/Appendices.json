It is a standard problem in the analysis of linear time-invariant (LTI) systems, requiring the application of fundamental principles of Laplace and Fourier transforms. The provided system function and ROC are consistent with the theory of bilateral Laplace transforms. All terms are precisely defined. The problem is therefore deemed valid. We proceed to the solution.\n\nThe frequency response of a continuous-time LTI system, denoted $H(j\\omega)$, is defined as the Fourier transform of its impulse response $h(t)$:\n$$\nH(j\\omega) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} h(t) \\exp(-j\\omega t) \\, dt\n$$\nThe bilateral Laplace transform of $h(t)$ is given by:\n$$\nH(s) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} h(t) \\exp(-st) \\, dt\n$$\nwhere $s = \\sigma + j\\omega$ is a complex variable. By direct comparison of these two definitions, it is evident that the frequency response $H(j\\omega)$ is the evaluation of the Laplace transform $H(s)$ on the imaginary axis, i.e., for $s = j\\omega$ (or $\\sigma = 0$).\n\nThis evaluation is valid if and only if the integral defining the Laplace transform converges for $s=j\\omega$. The set of all values of $s$ for which this integral converges is the region of convergence (ROC). Therefore, a necessary and sufficient condition for the frequency response $H(j\\omega)$ to exist for all real $\\omega$ is that the ROC of $H(s)$ must contain the imaginary axis, $\\Re(s) = 0$.\n\nThe specified ROC for the given system is the vertical strip $-2 < \\Re(s) < 1$. We must check if the line $\\Re(s) = 0$ lies within this region. The condition is $-2 < 0 < 1$, which is a true statement. Consequently, the imaginary axis is contained in the ROC, and the frequency response $H(j\\omega)$ exists for all $\\omega \\in \\mathbb{R}$. This also implies the system is Bounded-Input, Bounded-Output (BIBO) stable, which in turn guarantees that its frequency response is a bounded function of $\\omega$. We can now proceed to compute $N$.\n\nThe frequency response is obtained by substituting $s = j\\omega$ into $H(s)$:\n$$\nH(j\\omega) = \\frac{j\\omega + 3}{(j\\omega + 2)(j\\omega - 1)}\n$$\nTo find the essential supremum of the magnitude $|H(j\\omega)|$, we will first compute the magnitude squared, $|H(j\\omega)|^2$. The magnitude of a ratio of complex numbers is the ratio of their magnitudes.\n$$\n|H(j\\omega)| = \\frac{|3 + j\\omega|}{|2 + j\\omega| | -1 + j\\omega|}\n$$\nThe magnitude squared is therefore:\n$$\n|H(j\\omega)|^2 = \\frac{|3 + j\\omega|^2}{|2 + j\\omega|^2 |-1 + j\\omega|^2} = \\frac{3^2 + \\omega^2}{(2^2 + \\omega^2)((-1)^2 + \\omega^2)} = \\frac{9 + \\omega^2}{(4 + \\omega^2)(1 + \\omega^2)}\n$$\nTo find the maximum value of this expression, it is convenient to make the substitution $x = \\omega^2$.

This maximum corresponds to the maximum of $f(x)$ for $x \\ge 0$. We find this maximum by analyzing the derivative of $f(x)$ with respect to $x$. Using the quotient rule for differentiation, $\\frac{d}{dx}\\left(\\frac{u}{v}\\right) = \\frac{u'v - uv'}{v^2}$:\n$$\n\\frac{df}{dx} = \\frac{(1)(x^2 + 5x + 4) - (x + 9)(2x + 5)}{(x^2 + 5x + 4)^2}\n$$\nThe sign of the derivative is determined by its numerator:\n$$\n(x^2 + 5x + 4) - (2x^2 + 5x + 18x + 45) = x^2 + 5x + 4 - 2x^2 - 23x - 45 = -x^2 - 18x - 41\n$$\nSo, the derivative is:\n$$\n\\frac{df}{dx} = \\frac{-(x^2 + 18x + 41)}{(x^2 + 5x + 4)^2}\n$$\nThe denominator $(x^2 + 5x + 4)^2$ is always positive. For the domain of interest, $x \\ge 0$, the terms in the numerator's parenthesis $x^2$, $18x$, and $41$ are all non-negative (and their sum is strictly positive). Thus, the numerator $-(x^2 + 18x + 41)$ is strictly negative for all $x \\ge 0$.\nSince $\\frac{df}{dx} < 0$ for all $x \\ge 0$, the function $f(x)$ is strictly decreasing over its entire domain $x \\in [0, \\infty)$. The maximum value of a strictly decreasing function on a closed interval occurs at the left endpoint. Therefore, the maximum of $f(x)$ occurs at $x = 0$.\n\nThe maximum value of $|H(j\\omega)|^2$ is $f(0)$:\n$$\n\\max_{x \\ge 0} f(x) = f(0) = \\frac{0 + 9}{(0 + 4)(0 + 1)} = \\frac{9}{4}\n$$\nThis maximum corresponds to $\\omega^2 = 0$, or $\\omega = 0$.

Thus, $H_{\\min}(s)$ represents a stable system.\nThe nonminimum-phase system is defined as $H_{\\mathrm{nmp}}(s) \\triangleq H_{\\min}(s)\\,A(s)$. Substituting the given expressions:\n$$H_{\\mathrm{nmp}}(s) = \\frac{s + 3}{(s + 1)(s + 4)} \\cdot \\frac{s - 3}{s + 3}$$\nA pole-zero cancellation occurs at $s = -3$.

Since these poles are in the open left-half plane, $H_{\\mathrm{nmp}}(s)$ also represents a stable system.\n\nA system is minimum-phase if all its zeros also lie in the open left-half plane. A system is nonminimum-phase if it has at least one zero in the open right-half plane.\nThe zero of $H_{\\min}(s)$ is the root of the numerator, $s+3 = 0$, which is $z_1 = -3$. This lies in the open left-half plane, so $H_{\\min}(s)$ is a minimum-phase system.\nThe zero of $H_{\\mathrm{nmp}}(s)$ is the root of its numerator, $s-3=0$, which is $z_1 = 3$. This zero lies in the open right-half plane, so $H_{\\mathrm{nmp}}(s)$ is a nonminimum-phase system.\n\nA rational function is proper if the degree of the numerator polynomial is less than or equal to the degree of the denominator polynomial.\nFor $H_{\\min}(s) = \\frac{s + 3}{s^2 + 5s + 4}$, the degree of the numerator is $1$ and the degree of the denominator is $2$.

Since $1 \\le 2$, this function is also proper.\nAll initial classifications are thus justified.\n\nSecond, we prove the identity of the magnitude responses, $|H_{\\min}(\\mathrm{j}\\omega)| = |H_{\\mathrm{nmp}}(\\mathrm{j}\\omega)|$, by explicit calculation. The frequency response is found by substituting $s = \\mathrm{j}\\omega$.\nFor the minimum-phase system:\n$$H_{\\min}(\\mathrm{j}\\omega) = \\frac{\\mathrm{j}\\omega + 3}{(\\mathrm{j}\\omega + 1)(\\mathrm{j}\\omega + 4)}$$\nThe magnitude is the ratio of the magnitudes of the numerator and denominator:\n$$|H_{\\min}(\\mathrm{j}\\omega)| = \\frac{|\\mathrm{j}\\omega + 3|}{|\\mathrm{j}\\omega + 1| \\cdot |\\mathrm{j}\\omega + 4|}$$\nUsing the definition of complex magnitude $|x + \\mathrm{j}y| = \\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}$:\n$$|\\mathrm{j}\\omega + 3| = \\sqrt{3^2 + \\omega^2} = \\sqrt{9 + \\omega^2}$$\n$$|\\mathrm{j}\\omega + 1| = \\sqrt{1^2 + \\omega^2} = \\sqrt{1 + \\omega^2}$$\n$$|\\mathrm{j}\\omega + 4| = \\sqrt{4^2 + \\omega^2} = \\sqrt{16 + \\omega^2}$$\nCombining these results, we obtain the magnitude response:\n$$|H_{\\min}(\\mathrm{j}\\omega)| = \\frac{\\sqrt{9 + \\omega^2}}{\\sqrt{1 + \\omega^2} \\sqrt{16 + \\omega^2}}$$\nNow, for the nonminimum-phase system:\n$$H_{\\mathrm{nmp}}(\\mathrm{j}\\omega) = \\frac{\\mathrm{j}\\omega - 3}{(\\mathrm{j}\\omega + 1)(\\mathrm{j}\\omega + 4)}$$\nIts magnitude is:\n$$|H_{\\mathrm{nmp}}(\\mathrm{j}\\omega)| = \\frac{|\\mathrm{j}\\omega - 3|}{|\\mathrm{j}\\omega + 1| \\cdot |\\mathrm{j}\\omega + 4|}$$\nThe magnitude of the numerator is:\n$$|\\mathrm{j}\\omega - 3| = |-3 + \\mathrm{j}\\omega| = \\sqrt{(-3)^2 + \\omega^2} = \\sqrt{9 + \\omega^2}$$\nThe denominator magnitude is identical to that of $H_{\\min}(\\mathrm{j}\\omega)$.

This is expected, as $H_{\\mathrm{nmp}}(s)$ is derived from $H_{\\min}(s)$ by multiplication with an all-pass factor $A(s)$, which by definition has unity magnitude for all $\\omega$.\n\nThird, we derive the phase difference $\\Delta\\varphi(\\omega) \\triangleq \\arg(H_{\\mathrm{nmp}}(\\mathrm{j}\\omega)) - \\arg(H_{\\min}(\\mathrm{j}\\omega))$.\nFrom the relation $H_{\\mathrm{nmp}}(\\mathrm{j}\\omega) = H_{\\min}(\\mathrm{j}\\omega)A(\\mathrm{j}\\omega)$ and the property of the complex argument $\\arg(z_1 z_2) = \\arg(z_1) + \\arg(z_2)$, we have:\n$$\\arg(H_{\\mathrm{nmp}}(\\mathrm{j}\\omega)) = \\arg(H_{\\min}(\\mathrm{j}\\omega)) + \\arg(A(\\mathrm{j}\\omega))$$\nRearranging gives the desired phase difference:\n$$\\Delta\\varphi(\\omega) = \\arg(H_{\\mathrm{nmp}}(\\mathrm{j}\\omega)) - \\arg(H_{\\min}(\\mathrm{j}\\omega)) = \\arg(A(\\mathrm{j}\\omega))$$\nWe must now find the argument of the all-pass filter's frequency response, $A(\\mathrm{j}\\omega)$.\n$$A(\\mathrm{j}\\omega) = \\frac{\\mathrm{j}\\omega - 3}{\\mathrm{j}\\omega + 3} = \\frac{-3 + \\mathrm{j}\\omega}{3 + \\mathrm{j}\\omega}$$\nThe argument of a ratio of complex numbers $\\frac{z_N}{z_D}$ is $\\arg(z_N) - \\arg(z_D)$.
