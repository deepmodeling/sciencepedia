Note that by definition, $A_{m-1}^\\sharp(z) = z^{-(m-1)}A_{m-1}(z^{-1})$.\n\nWe now verify the properties of this recursion, starting with the initial condition $A_0(z) = 1$.\n1.  **Monic property ($a_{m,0}=1$):** Assume $A_{m-1}(z)$ is monic ($a_{m-1,0}=1$). In the recursion, $A_{m-1}(z)$ contributes its constant term, 1, to the constant term of $A_m(z)$. The second term, $k_m z^{-1} A_{m-1}^\\sharp(z)$, is of order 1 or higher in $z^{-1}$, so it has no constant term. Thus, $a_{m,0} = a_{m-1,0} = 1$. The monic property is preserved at each step. (The problem's notation $A_m(0)$ is interpreted as evaluating the constant term of the polynomial in $z^{-1}$.)\n\n2.  **Last coefficient property ($a_{m,m}=k_m$):** The coefficient $a_{m,m}$ corresponds to the term $z^{-m}$. The polynomial $A_{m-1}(z)$ is of order $m-1$, so it does not contribute. The $z^{-m}$ term must come from $k_m z^{-1} A_{m-1}^\\sharp(z)$. The reversed polynomial is $A_{m-1}^\\sharp(z) = \\sum_{i=0}^{m-1} a_{m-1,m-1-i}z^{-i}$. The coefficient of $z^{-(m-1)}$ in $A_{m-1}^\\sharp(z)$ is $a_{m-1, (m-1)-(m-1)} = a_{m-1,0}$. Since $A_{m-1}(z)$ is monic, $a_{m-1,0}=1$. Therefore, the coefficient of $z^{-m}$ in the term $k_m z^{-1} A_{m-1}^\\sharp(z)$ is $k_m \\cdot a_{m-1,0} = k_m \\cdot 1 = k_m$. This confirms the property.\n\n3.  **Schur stability (minimum-phase):** To show that all zeros of $A_m(z)$ are strictly inside the unit circle if $|k_i|<1$ for all $i$, we analyze the corresponding polynomial in $z$, $P_m(z) = z^m A_m(z)$. The zeros of $P_m(z)$ (for $z \\neq 0$) are identical to the zeros of $A_m(z)$. The recursion for $P_m(z)$ is $P_m(z) = z P_{m-1}(z) + k_m P_{m-1}^\\#(z)$, where $P_{m-1}^\\#(z) = z^{m-1}P_{m-1}(z^{-1})$ is the reciprocal polynomial.\n    We apply Rouche's theorem. Let $f(z) = z P_{m-1}(z)$ and $g(z) = k_m P_{m-1}^\\#(z)$. On the unit circle $|z|=1$, we have $|f(z)| = |P_{m-1}(z)|$. Also, since coefficients are real, $|P_{m-1}^\\#(z)| = |z^{m-1}P_{m-1}(z^{-1})| = |P_{m-1}(z^*)| = |P_{m-1}(z)|$. Thus, on the unit circle, $|g(z)| = |k_m| |P_{m-1}(z)| = |k_m| |f(z)|$.\n    Given $|k_m|<1$, we have $|g(z)| < |f(z)|$ on $|z|=1$, provided $P_{m-1}(z)$ has no zeros on the unit circle (which is true by induction from the stable base case $P_0(z)=1$). By Rouche's theorem, $P_m(z) = f(z)+g(z)$ has the same number of zeros inside the unit circle as $f(z) = z P_{m-1}(z)$. By inductive hypothesis, $P_{m-1}(z)$ has $m-1$ zeros inside the unit circle. The function $f(z)$ has these $m-1$ zeros plus one zero at $z=0$. Thus $f(z)$ has $m$ zeros inside the unit circle. Therefore, $P_m(z)$ also has $m$ zeros inside the unit circle, proving stability.\n\n4.  **Relation on the unit circle:** For any real-coefficient polynomial $A_m(z)$, on the unit circle $z=e^{\\mathrm{j}\\omega}$, we have $|A_m^\\sharp(z)|^2 = |z^{-m}A_m(z^{-1})|^2 = |z|^{-2m}|A_m(z^*)|^2 = |A_m(z)^*|^2 = |A_m(z)|^2$. This shows the magnitudes are equal. The question also implies a relation between stages. From the recursion, on the unit circle:\n    $|A_m(z)|^2 = |A_{m-1}(z) + k_m z^{-1} A_{m-1}^\\sharp(z)|^2$.\n    Using $|A_{m-1}^\\sharp(z)|=|A_{m-1}(z)|$ and $|z^{-1}|=1$, this expands to:\n    $|A_m(e^{\\mathrm{j}\\omega})|^2 = |A_{m-1}(e^{\\mathrm{j}\\omega})|^2(1+|k_m|^2) + 2 k_m \\text{Re}\\{e^{-\\mathrm{j}\\omega} A_{m-1}^\\sharp(e^{\\mathrm{j}\\omega}) A_{m-1}(e^{\\mathrm{j}\\omega})^*\\}$.\n\n**Part 2: Computation of $A_3(z)$**\n\nWe are given the reflection coefficients $k_1=\\frac{1}{2}$, $k_2=-\\frac{1}{3}$, $k_3=\\frac{1}{4}$.

This is equivalent to the two conditions $-1 < \\hat{k}_m$ and $\\hat{k}_m < 1$ holding for all $m$.\n\nFirst, we analyze the condition $\\hat{k}_m < 1$. The set of representable values is specified for a $Q$-bit fractional part in two's complement. The maximum representable value is $(2^Q-1) \\cdot 2^{-Q} = 1 - 2^{-Q}$.
