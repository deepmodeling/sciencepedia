We shall proceed with its solution from first principles.\n\nThe system function, denoted as $H(z)$, is the $z$-transform of the impulse response of a linear time-invariant (LTI) system. For a system with a set of zeros $\\{z_m\\}$ and poles $\\{p_k\\}$, the system function is of the form:\n$$H(z) = K \\frac{\\prod_m (z - z_m)}{\\prod_k (z - p_k)}$$\nwhere $K$ is a constant gain factor.\n\nThe provided information specifies the locations of the zeros and the pole:\n- Zeros are at $z_1 = 1$ and $z_2 = -1$.\n- A single pole is at $p_1 = 0.9$.\n- The gain is an arbitrary nonzero real constant $K$, with $K \\in \\mathbb{R}\\setminus\\{0\\}$.\n\nSubstituting these values into the general form, we construct the system function for the given system:\n$$H(z) = K \\frac{(z - 1)(z - (-1))}{z - 0.9} = K \\frac{(z - 1)(z + 1)}{z - 0.9} = K \\frac{z^2 - 1}{z - 0.9}$$\n\nThe frequency response of a discrete-time system, $H(\\exp(j\\omega))$, is the Discrete-Time Fourier Transform (DTFT) of its impulse response. A fundamental relationship in signal processing states that if the region of convergence (ROC) of the system function $H(z)$ includes the unit circle, $|z|=1$, then the frequency response is obtained by evaluating $H(z)$ on the unit circle. That is, $H(\\exp(j\\omega)) = H(z)|_{z=\\exp(j\\omega)}$.\n\nThe problem states that the system is causal and Bounded-Input Bounded-Output (BIBO) stable. For a rational system function, BIBO stability is equivalent to the ROC including the unit circle. The single pole is at $z=0.9$, which is inside the unit circle. For a causal system, the ROC is the region outside the outermost pole, so the ROC is $|z|  0.9$. This region contains the unit circle, $|z|=1$, which is consistent with the stability requirement. Thus, the evaluation of $H(z)$ on the unit circle is justified.\n\nThe frequency response is:\n$$H(\\exp(j\\omega)) = K \\frac{(\\exp(j\\omega))^2 - 1}{\\exp(j\\omega) - 0.9} = K \\frac{\\exp(j2\\omega) - 1}{\\exp(j\\omega) - 0.9}$$\nWe are required to find the magnitude of this response at the angular frequencies $\\omega=0$ and $\\omega=\\pi$.\n\nCase 1: DC response, $\\omega=0$.\nThe point on the unit circle corresponding to $\\omega=0$ is $z = \\exp(j \\cdot 0) = \\cos(0) + j\\sin(0) = 1$.

Specifically, it is proportional to the product of distances from the zeros, divided by the product of distances from the poles. A zero at a point $z_m$ in the $z$-plane forces the system function $H(z_m)$ to be zero. If a zero lies directly on the unit circle, at $z_m = \\exp(j\\omega_0)$, the distance from this zero to the point $\\exp(j\\omega_0)$ is zero. Consequently, the numerator of the magnitude expression becomes zero, and the frequency response magnitude $|H(\\exp(j\\omega_0))|$ is exactly zero.\n\nIn this problem, the system has zeros at $z=1$ and $z=-1$.\n1.  The zero at $z=1$ corresponds to the frequency $\\omega=0$ (DC). The result $|H(\\exp(j0))|=0$ signifies that the system completely blocks, or places a \"notch\" at, the DC component of any input signal. This demonstrates perfect selectivity against DC.\n2.  The zero at $z=-1$ corresponds to the Nyquist frequency $\\omega=\\pi$. The result $|H(\\exp(j\\pi))|=0$ signifies that the system completely blocks the highest possible frequency component in the discrete-time baseband. This demonstrates perfect selectivity against the Nyquist frequency.\n\nThe pole at $z=0.9$ is close to the zero at $z=1$. This proximity causes the response to rise sharply for frequencies just above $\\omega=0$, creating a very narrow and deep notch at DC. This configuration is characteristic of a filter designed to eliminate specific frequency components, in this case, DC and the Nyquist frequency, while passing other frequencies.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n0  0\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "2873524"}, {"introduction": "While zeros on the unit circle create nulls, poles positioned near the imaginary axis (for continuous-time systems) or the unit circle (for discrete-time systems) are responsible for creating resonant peaks.

Therefore, the problem is valid, and we proceed to a rigorous solution.\n\nWe begin from first principles. The system is modeled by a second-order all-pole transfer function $H(z)$ with a complex-conjugate pair of poles. Let the poles be $p_1 = r e^{j\\theta}$ and $p_2 = r e^{-j\\theta}$. For a causal and stable system, the poles must lie inside the unit circle, which requires $|r|1$. The transfer function is given by:\n$$H(z) = \\frac{G}{(z - p_1)(z - p_2)} = \\frac{G}{(z - r e^{j\\theta})(z - r e^{-j\\theta})}$$\nwhere $G$ is a constant gain factor.\n\nThe discrete-time frequency response is obtained by evaluating $H(z)$ on the unit circle, where $z = e^{j\\omega}$ and $\\omega$ is the angular frequency in radians per sample.\n$$H(e^{j\\omega}) = \\frac{G}{(e^{j\\omega} - r e^{j\\theta})(e^{j\\omega} - r e^{-j\\theta})}$$\nWe are interested in the magnitude of this response.

Consequently, for frequencies $\\omega$ in the vicinity of the pole angle $\\theta$, the distance $|e^{j\\omega} - r e^{j\\theta}|$ to the pole $p_1$ changes very rapidly, while the distance $|e^{j\\omega} - r e^{-j\\theta}|$ to the conjugate pole $p_2$ is much larger and varies slowly. The resonance peak is therefore dominated by the minimum of the distance to the closer pole, which occurs when $\\omega$ is approximately equal to $\\theta$. The problem states that the observed resonance is at $\\omega_0$. Thus, it is a well-justified approximation for a high-Q (narrowband) resonance to set the pole angle estimate to the measured resonance frequency: $\\theta = \\omega_0$.\n\nUnder this narrowband assumption, we analyze the magnitude squared near the resonance, $\\omega = \\theta + \\delta\\omega$, where $\\delta\\omega$ is a small frequency deviation.

We must solve this equation for $r$.\n$$\\Delta \\sqrt{r} = 1-r$$\nSquaring both sides yields:\n$$\\Delta^2 r = (1-r)^2 = 1 - 2r + r^2$$\nRearranging into a standard quadratic form $ar^2+br+c=0$:\n$$r^2 - (2+\\Delta^2)r + 1 = 0$$\nUsing the quadratic formula, $r = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}$:\n$$r = \\frac{(2+\\Delta^2) \\pm \\sqrt{(-(2+\\Delta^2))^2 - 4(1)(1)}}{2} = \\frac{2+\\Delta^2 \\pm \\sqrt{4+4\\Delta^2+\\Delta^4 - 4}}{2}$$\n$$r = \\frac{2+\\Delta^2 \\pm \\sqrt{4\\Delta^2+\\Delta^4}}{2} = \\frac{2+\\Delta^2 \\pm \\Delta\\sqrt{4+\\Delta^2}}{2}$$\nSince the system is stable, the pole radius must satisfy $r1$. The solution with the plus sign would produce $r = 1 + \\frac{\\Delta^2}{2} + \\frac{\\Delta\\sqrt{4+\\Delta^2}}{2}  1$, which corresponds to an unstable system. We must therefore choose the minus sign:\n$$r = \\frac{2+\\Delta^2 - \\Delta\\sqrt{4+\\Delta^2}}{2}$$\nThis is the derived explicit estimate for $r$ in terms of $\\Delta$.\n\nWe are given the measured values: $\\omega_0 = 1.3728$ and $B = 0.024$.\nThe pole angle is estimated as $\\theta = \\omega_0 = 1.3728$ radians.\nThe half-width is $\\Delta = B/2 = 0.024/2 = 0.012$.\nNow, we substitute $\\Delta = 0.012$ into the expression for $r$:\n$$r = \\frac{2+(0.012)^2 - (0.012)\\sqrt{4+(0.012)^2}}{2}$$\n$$r = \\frac{2+0.000144 - 0.012\\sqrt{4+0.000144}}{2}$$\n$$r = \\frac{2.000144 - 0.012\\sqrt{4.000144}}{2}$$\n$$r = \\frac{2.000144 - 0.012 \\times (2.00003599955...)}{2}$$\n$$r = \\frac{2.000144 - 0.02400043199...}{2}$$\n$$r = \\frac{1.976143568...}{2} = 0.988071784...$$\nRounding to six significant figures, we get $r \\approx 0.988072$.\n\nThe final estimated parameters for the pole pair are $r = 0.988072$ and $\\theta = 1.3728$ radians.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 0.988072  1.3728 \\end{pmatrix}}$$", "id": "2873534"}]}
