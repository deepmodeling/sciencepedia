A rigorous derivation will now be provided.\n\nThe mean squared error $J$ is defined as the expectation of the squared error:\n$$J = \\mathbb{E}\\{(X - q(X))^2\\} = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} (x-q(x))^2 f_{X}(x) dx$$\nSubstituting the given PDF and the structure of the quantizer, the expression for $J$ becomes a function of the parameters $\\{m_1, m_2, m_3, t_1, t_2\\}$:\n$$J(m_1, m_2, m_3, t_1, t_2) = \\int_{-1}^{t_1} (x - m_1)^2 \\frac{1}{2} dx + \\int_{t_1}^{t_2} (x - m_2)^2 \\frac{1}{2} dx + \\int_{t_2}^{1} (x - m_3)^2 \\frac{1}{2} dx$$\nTo minimize $J$, we must find the stationary points by setting the partial derivatives of $J$ with respect to each parameter to zero.\n\nFirst, we derive the necessary conditions for the optimal representation levels $\\{m_1, m_2, m_3\\}$. We differentiate $J$ with respect to each $m_i$ and set the result to zero:\n$$\\frac{\\partial J}{\\partial m_1} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial m_1} \\left[ \\frac{1}{2} \\int_{-1}^{t_1} (x - m_1)^2 dx \\right] = \\frac{1}{2} \\int_{-1}^{t_1} 2(x - m_1)(-1) dx = -\\int_{-1}^{t_1} (x - m_1) dx = 0$$\nThis implies $\\int_{-1}^{t_1} x dx = m_1 \\int_{-1}^{t_1} dx$, which gives the optimal $m_1$ as the conditional mean of $X$ given $X \\in R_1$:\n$$m_1 = \\frac{\\int_{-1}^{t_1} x dx}{\\int_{-1}^{t_1} dx} = \\frac{\\frac{1}{2}[x^2]_{-1}^{t_1}}{[x]_{-1}^{t_1}} = \\frac{\\frac{1}{2}(t_1^2 - 1)}{t_1 + 1} = \\frac{t_1 - 1}{2}$$\nBy identical reasoning for $m_2$ and $m_3$:\n$$\\frac{\\partial J}{\\partial m_2} = -\\int_{t_1}^{t_2} (x - m_2) dx = 0 \\implies m_2 = \\frac{\\int_{t_1}^{t_2} x dx}{\\int_{t_1}^{t_2} dx} = \\frac{\\frac{1}{2}(t_2^2 - t_1^2)}{t_2 - t_1} = \\frac{t_1 + t_2}{2}$$\n$$\\frac{\\partial J}{\\partial m_3} = -\\int_{t_2}^{1} (x - m_3) dx = 0 \\implies m_3 = \\frac{\\int_{t_2}^{1} x dx}{\\int_{t_2}^{1} dx} = \\frac{\\frac{1}{2}(1 - t_2^2)}{1 - t_2} = \\frac{1 + t_2}{2}$$\nThese are the centroid conditions for optimality.\n\nNext, we derive the necessary conditions for the optimal decision thresholds $\\{t_1, t_2\\}$. We differentiate $J$ with respect to each $t_j$.

This yields:\n$$t_1 = \\frac{m_1 + m_2}{2}$$\nSimilarly, for $t_2$:\n$$\\frac{\\partial J}{\\partial t_2} = \\frac{1}{2} (t_2 - m_2)^2 - \\frac{1}{2} (t_2 - m_3)^2 = 0$$\nWith $m_2 < t_2 < m_3$, we find $t_2 - m_2 = -(t_2 - m_3)$, which gives:\n$$t_2 = \\frac{m_2 + m_3}{2}$$\nThese are the nearest-neighbor conditions for optimality.\n\nThe problem possesses symmetry. The PDF $f_X(x)$ is an even function on a symmetric interval $[-1, 1]$. For such a distribution, the optimal quantizer must be symmetric about the origin. This means its structure must be anti-symmetric, $q(x) = -q(-x)$. This symmetry implies $t_2 = -t_1$, $m_3 = -m_1$, and $m_2 = -m_2$, which forces $m_2=0$. This greatly simplifies the system of equations.\n\nLet us apply the symmetry conditions to the optimality equations.\n$m_2=0$.\nThe condition $t_1 = \\frac{m_1+m_2}{2}$ becomes $t_1 = \\frac{m_1}{2}$.\nThe condition $m_1 = \\frac{t_1-1}{2}$ becomes $m_1 = \\frac{(m_1/2) - 1}{2}$.\nSolving for $m_1$:\n$$2m_1 = \\frac{m_1}{2} - 1 \\implies \\frac{3}{2}m_1 = -1 \\implies m_1 = -\\frac{2}{3}$$\nFrom this, we find the other parameters for the optimal quantizer:\n$$t_1 = \\frac{m_1}{2} = \\frac{-2/3}{2} = -\\frac{1}{3}$$\n$$m_2 = 0$$\n$$m_3 = -m_1 = \\frac{2}{3}$$\n$$t_2 = -t_1 = \\frac{1}{3}$$\nThe optimal parameters are $(m_{1},m_{2},m_{3},t_{1},t_{2}) = (-\\frac{2}{3}, 0, \\frac{2}{3}, -\\frac{1}{3}, \\frac{1}{3})$.\n\nNext, we construct the uniform-spacing $3$-level quantizer on $[-1,1]$.\nThe total length of the interval is $1 - (-1) = 2$.\nFor $3$ regions of equal width, each region has a width of $\\Delta = \\frac{2}{3}$.\nThe decision thresholds, denoted by $\\tilde{t}_i$, are the boundaries of these regions:\n$$\\tilde{t}_1 = -1 + \\Delta = -1 + \\frac{2}{3} = -\\frac{1}{3}$$\n$$\\tilde{t}_2 = -1 + 2\\Delta = -1 + \\frac{4}{3} = \\frac{1}{3}$$\nThe decision regions are therefore $R_1 = [-1, -1/3)$, $R_2 = [-1/3, 1/3)$, and $R_3 = [1/3, 1]$.\nThe representation levels, denoted by $\\tilde{m}_i$, are the midpoints of these regions:\n$$\\tilde{m}_1 = \\frac{-1 + (-\\frac{1}{3})}{2} = \\frac{-4/3}{2} = -\\frac{2}{3}$$\n$$\\tilde{m}_2 = \\frac{-\\frac{1}{3} + \\frac{1}{3}}{2} = 0$$\n$$\\tilde{m}_3 = \\frac{\\frac{1}{3} + 1}{2} = \\frac{4/3}{2} = \\frac{2}{3}$$\nThe parameters for the uniform-spacing quantizer are $(\\tilde{m}_{1},\\tilde{m}_{2},\\tilde{m}_{3},\\tilde{t}_{1},\\tilde{t}_{2}) = (-\\frac{2}{3}, 0, \\frac{2}{3}, -\\frac{1}{3}, \\frac{1}{3})$.\nIt is a known result that for a uniformly distributed source, the optimal scalar quantizer is a uniform quantizer.

First, we will derive a general expression for the mean quantization error $\\mathbb{E}[e]$ for a symmetric probability density function $f_X(x)$, and then we will specialize this result to compute the exact mean error for a uniform distribution over a single quantization interval.\n\nPart 1: General Derivation for Symmetric PDF\n\nWe are given the quantization error $e(x) = Q(x) - x$, where the truncation quantizer is defined as $Q(x) = \\Delta \\lfloor x/\\Delta \\rfloor$ for a step size $\\Delta > 0$. The mean quantization error is the expected value of the error random variable $e(X) = Q(X) - X$.

Over each such interval, $Q(x)$ is constant and equal to $k\\Delta$. We can thus partition the real line into disjoint quantization bins $[k\\Delta, (k+1)\\Delta)$ for all integers $k \\in \\mathbb{Z}$ and express the integral as an infinite sum of integrals over these bins:\n$$ \\mathbb{E}[e] = \\sum_{k=-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\int_{k\\Delta}^{(k+1)\\Delta} (k\\Delta - x) f_X(x) \\,dx $$\nThis expression gives the mean error in terms of a sum of integrals over the quantization bins, as required by the first part of the problem.\n\nNext, we must show that for a symmetric PDF, where $f_X(x) = f_X(-x)$, this mean error is nonzero. We will do this by pairing the terms in the sum. Let us pair the term for index $k$ with the term for index $j = -k-1$. This pairing covers all integers exhaustively as $k$ ranges from $0$ to $\\infty$. Let $I_k$ be the integral for a given index $k$:\n$$ I_k = \\int_{k\\Delta}^{(k+1)\\Delta} (k\\Delta - x) f_X(x) \\,dx $$\nThe integral for index $j = -k-1$ is:\n$$ I_{-k-1} = \\int_{(-k-1)\\Delta}^{-k\\Delta} ((-k-1)\\Delta - x) f_X(x) \\,dx $$\nIn this second integral, let us perform a substitution $u = -x$, which implies $x = -u$ and $dx = -du$. The limits of integration change from $x = (-k-1)\\Delta$ to $u = (k+1)\\Delta$, and from $x = -k\\Delta$ to $u = k\\Delta$. Using the symmetry of the PDF, $f_X(x) = f_X(-u) = f_X(u)$, the integral becomes:\n$$ I_{-k-1} = \\int_{(k+1)\\Delta}^{k\\Delta} (-(k+1)\\Delta + u) f_X(u) (-du) = \\int_{k\\Delta}^{(k+1)\\Delta} (u - (k+1)\\Delta) f_X(u) \\,du $$\nNow we sum the paired terms $I_k$ and $I_{-k-1}$.

This demonstrates that truncation quantization introduces a systematic bias (a non-zero mean error), even for symmetrically distributed signals.\n\nPart 2: Specialization to Uniform Distribution over One Bin\n\nWe are now asked to specialize this result to the case where $X$ is uniformly distributed over a single quantization bin, $X \\sim \\mathrm{Uniform}([m\\Delta, (m+1)\\Delta))$ for some fixed integer $m$.\nThe PDF for this distribution is:\n$$ f_X(x) = \\begin{cases} \\frac{1}{(m+1)\\Delta - m\\Delta} = \\frac{1}{\\Delta} & \\text{for } x \\in [m\\Delta, (m+1)\\Delta) \\\\ 0 & \\text{otherwise} \\end{cases} $$\nWe use our derived expression for the mean error:\n$$ \\mathbb{E}[e] = \\sum_{k=-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\int_{k\\Delta}^{(k+1)\\Delta} (k\\Delta - x) f_X(x) \\,dx $$\nSince $f_X(x)$ is zero everywhere except for the interval $[m\\Delta, (m+1)\\Delta)$, all terms in the summation are zero except for the term where $k=m$. The sum thus collapses to a single integral:\n$$ \\mathbb{E}[e] = \\int_{m\\Delta}^{(m+1)\\Delta} (m\\Delta - x) f_X(x) \\,dx $$\nSubstituting the value of the PDF, $f_X(x) = 1/\\Delta$, into this integral:\n$$ \\mathbb{E}[e] = \\int_{m\\Delta}^{(m+1)\\Delta} (m\\Delta - x) \\frac{1}{\\Delta} \\,dx $$\nWe now compute this definite integral:\n$$ \\mathbb{E}[e] = \\frac{1}{\\Delta} \\left[ m\\Delta x - \\frac{x^2}{2} \\right]_{m\\Delta}^{(m+1)\\Delta} $$\n$$ = \\frac{1}{\\Delta} \\left( \\left( m\\Delta(m+1)\\Delta - \\frac{((m+1)\\Delta)^2}{2} \\right) - \\left( m\\Delta(m\\Delta) - \\frac{(m\\Delta)^2}{2} \\right) \\right) $$\n$$ = \\frac{\\Delta^2}{\\Delta} \\left( \\left( m(m+1) - \\frac{(m+1)^2}{2} \\right) - \\left( m^2 - \\frac{m^2}{2} \\right) \\right) $$\n$$ = \\Delta \\left( \\frac{2m(m+1) - (m+1)^2}{2} - \\frac{m^2}{2} \\right) $$\n$$ = \\Delta \\left( \\frac{(m+1)(2m - (m+1))}{2} - \\frac{m^2}{2} \\right) = \\Delta \\left( \\frac{(m+1)(m-1)}{2} - \\frac{m^2}{2} \\right) $$\n$$ = \\Delta \\left( \\frac{m^2 - 1}{2} - \\frac{m^2}{2} \\right) = \\Delta \\left( \\frac{m^2 - 1 - m^2}{2} \\right) = -\\frac{\\Delta}{2} $$\nThe result is independent of the specific bin index $m$ and matches the general result for symmetric distributions, although the uniform distribution on a single bin $[m\\Delta, (m+1)\\Delta)$ is not symmetric about the origin (unless $m=-1/2$, which is not an integer). The calculation demonstrates that the average error within any single truncation bin is consistently $-\\Delta/2$.", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{-\\frac{\\Delta}{2}} $$"}]}
