Let us define the complex function $C(\\omega) = 1 - a \\exp(\\mathrm{j}\\,\\omega)$. Its complex conjugate is $C^*(\\omega) = (1 - a \\exp(\\mathrm{j}\\,\\omega))^* = 1 - a^* (\\exp(\\mathrm{j}\\,\\omega))^* = 1 - a^* \\exp(-\\mathrm{j}\\,\\omega)$.\nSubstituting these into the frequency response expression, we get:\n$$H_1(\\exp(\\mathrm{j}\\,\\omega)) = \\frac{\\exp(-\\mathrm{j}\\,\\omega) C(\\omega)}{C^*(\\omega)}$$\nThis form confirms the all-pass property, as $|H_1(\\exp(\\mathrm{j}\\,\\omega))| = |\\exp(-\\mathrm{j}\\,\\omega)| \\frac{|C(\\omega)|}{|C^*(\\omega)|} = 1 \\cdot \\frac{|C(\\omega)|}{|C(\\omega)|} = 1$.\nThe phase angle of the frequency response, $\\Theta(\\omega) = \\arg(H_1(\\exp(\\mathrm{j}\\,\\omega)))$, can be found from the sum of the arguments of the terms:\n$$\\Theta(\\omega) = \\arg(\\exp(-\\mathrm{j}\\,\\omega)) + \\arg(C(\\omega)) - \\arg(C^*(\\omega))$$\nSince $\\arg(C^*(\\omega)) = -\\arg(C(\\omega))$, we have:\n$$\\Theta(\\omega) = -\\omega + 2\\arg(C(\\omega)) = -\\omega + 2\\arg(1 - a \\exp(\\mathrm{j}\\,\\omega))$$\nLet $a = r \\exp(\\mathrm{j}\\,\\phi)$, where $r = |a|$ and $\\phi = \\arg(a)$.

The numerator $1 - |a|^2$ is a positive constant. Therefore, $\\tau(\\omega)$ is maximized when its denominator is minimized. The denominator is $D(\\omega) = 1 + |a|^2 - 2|a|\\cos(\\omega + \\arg(a))$. To minimize $D(\\omega)$, we must maximize the term $\\cos(\\omega + \\arg(a))$. The maximum value of the cosine function is $1$, which occurs when its argument is an integer multiple of $2\\pi$.\n$$\\omega_p + \\arg(a) = 2k\\pi, \\quad k \\in \\mathbb{Z}$$\nThis gives the peak frequency $\\omega_p = -\\arg(a) + 2k\\pi$. The pole of the system is $p = a^* = |a|\\exp(-\\mathrm{j}\\arg(a))$, so its angle is $-\\arg(a)$. Thus, the peak group delay frequency $\\omega_p$ is indeed aligned with the angle of the pole. The function $\\cos(\\cdot)$ has a unique maximum over any interval of length $2\\pi$, so the peak frequency is unique within a principal interval like $[-\\pi, \\pi]$.\nThe peak value of the group delay, $\\tau_{\\text{peak}}$, is found by substituting $\\cos(\\omega_p + \\arg(a)) = 1$ into the expression for $\\tau(\\omega)$:\n$$\\tau_{\\text{peak}} = \\frac{1 - |a|^2}{1 - 2|a|(1) + |a|^2} = \\frac{1 - |a|^2}{(1-|a|)^2} = \\frac{(1-|a|)(1+|a|)}{(1-|a|)^2} = \\frac{1+|a|}{1-|a|}$$\nThis completes item 2). The peak value depends only on the magnitude of $a$.\n\nFor item 3), we are given the design requirements: a peak group delay $\\tau_p > 1$ occurring at an angular frequency $\\omega_p$. From our analysis in item 2), we have two conditions:\n$$ \\tau_p = \\frac{1+|a|}{1-|a|} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\omega_p = -\\arg(a) $$\nWe can solve the first equation for $|a|$:\n$$\\tau_p(1-|a|) = 1+|a|$$\n$$\\tau_p - \\tau_p|a| = 1+|a|$$\n$$\\tau_p - 1 = |a|(1+\\tau_p)$$\n$$|a| = \\frac{\\tau_p - 1}{\\tau_p + 1}$$\nThe condition $\\tau_p > 1$ ensures that $0 < |a| < 1$, which is consistent with the stability requirement. From the second equation, we have $\\arg(a) = -\\omega_p$.\nThe parameter $a$ can be constructed from its magnitude $|a|$ and argument $\\arg(a)$ using the polar form $a = |a|\\exp(\\mathrm{j}\\,\\arg(a))$:\n$$a = \\left(\\frac{\\tau_p - 1}{\\tau_p + 1}\\right) \\exp(-\\mathrm{j}\\,\\omega_p)$$\nThis is the required closed-form expression for $a$.\n\nFor item 4), we discuss the trade-off for a real parameter $a \\in (-1, 1)$.\nIf $a \\in \\mathbb{R}$, then $\\arg(a)$ is either $0$ (for $a>0$) or $\\pi$ (for $a<0$).\nThe peak delay is $\\tau_{\\text{peak}} = \\frac{1+|a|}{1-|a|}$. As $|a| \\to 1$, $\\tau_{\\text{peak}} \\to \\infty$.\nIf $a \\to 1^-$, we have $|a| \\to 1$ and $\\arg(a) = 0$. The group delay peak occurs at $\\omega_p = 0$ (DC) and its height becomes very large. The delay expression near $\\omega=0$ can be approximated as a Lorentzian function $\\tau(\\omega) \\approx \\frac{2(1-a)}{(1-a)^2 + a\\omega^2}$. The bandwidth of this peak, characterized by its half-width, is proportional to $1-a$. Thus, as $a$ approaches $1$, the peak delay becomes higher but also much narrower. In the time domain, the pole at $z=a$ approaches the unit circle at $z=1$. This causes the system's impulse response, which contains a term $a^n$, to decay very slowly, leading to poor transient response and long settling times.\nIf $a \\to -1^+$, we have $|a| \\to 1$ and $\\arg(a) = \\pi$. The group delay peak occurs at $\\omega_p = \\pi$ (Nyquist frequency). A similar analysis shows that the peak becomes infinitely high and narrow as $a$ approaches $-1$. In the time domain, the pole at $z=a$ approaches $z=-1$, causing the impulse response, with its term $a^n = (-|a|)^n$, to be a slowly decaying alternating sequence.\nThe fundamental trade-off is this: achieving a very large group delay at a specific frequency requires placing a pole very close to the unit circle. This inevitably leads to a sharp, narrow-band peak in the group delay profile and a slow-settling (nearly unstable) response in the time domain. High selectivity in group delay comes at the cost of reduced bandwidth and poor time-domain performance.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\left(\\frac{\\tau_p - 1}{\\tau_p + 1}\\right) \\exp(-\\mathrm{j}\\,\\omega_p)}$$", "id": "2851787"}, {"introduction": "While designing a single filter section is instructive, practical applications often require approximating a complex, arbitrary group delay curve.

It addresses a standard topic in digital signal processing, namely, the effects of coefficient quantization on the performance of an all-pass filter. All provided definitions and parameters are consistent with established theory. We may therefore proceed with a full solution. The problem asks for two derivations: the first-order sensitivity of pole locations and an upper bound on the magnitude response deviation.\n\nFirst, we analyze the sensitivity of the pole locations. The poles of the ideal filter\n$$\nH(z) = \\frac{r^{2} - 2 r \\cos(\\theta) z^{-1} + z^{-2}}{1 - 2 r \\cos(\\theta) z^{-1} + r^{2} z^{-2}}\n$$\nare the roots of the denominator polynomial $D(z) = 1 - 2 r \\cos(\\theta) z^{-1} + r^{2} z^{-2}$. To find these roots, we solve $D(z)=0$, which is equivalent to solving the characteristic polynomial in positive powers of $z$, $P(z) = z^2 D(z) = z^2 - 2r\\cos(\\theta)z + r^2 = 0$. The roots are a complex conjugate pair $p = r \\exp(j\\theta)$ and $p^* = r \\exp(-j\\theta)$, as $0 < r < 1$ and $0 < \\theta < \\pi$.\nThe denominator can be written in factored form as $D(z) = (1 - p z^{-1})(1 - p^* z^{-1})$.\n\nThe implemented filter has a perturbed denominator $\\widetilde{D}(z) = D(z) + \\Delta D(z)$, where $\\Delta D(z) = \\Delta d_0 + \\Delta d_1 z^{-1} + \\Delta d_2 z^{-2}$. The perturbed pole $\\tilde{p} = p + \\Delta p$ must be a root of $\\widetilde{D}(\\tilde{p}) = 0$. Using a first-order Taylor series expansion around the original pole $p$, we have:\n$$\n\\widetilde{D}(p + \\Delta p) \\approx \\widetilde{D}(p) + \\widetilde{D}'(p) \\Delta p = 0\n$$\nSince $p$ is a root of the ideal denominator, $D(p)=0$, we have $\\widetilde{D}(p) = D(p) + \\Delta D(p) = \\Delta D(p)$. For the derivative, a first-order approximation uses the unperturbed polynomial: $\\widetilde{D}'(p) \\approx D'(p)$. The pole perturbation $\\Delta p$ is thus given by:\n$$\n\\Delta p \\approx -\\frac{\\Delta D(p)}{D'(p)}\n$$\nThe error polynomial evaluated at the pole $p$ is $\\Delta D(p) = \\Delta d_0 + \\Delta d_1 p^{-1} + \\Delta d_2 p^{-2}$.\nThe derivative of the denominator is $D'(z) = p z^{-2}(1-p^*z^{-1}) + p^*z^{-2}(1-pz^{-1})$. Evaluating at $z=p$:\n$$\nD'(p) = p p^{-2}(1 - p^* p^{-1}) = p^{-1}(1 - p^* p^{-1}) = \\frac{p-p^*}{p^2}\n$$\nThe difference between the poles is $p - p^* = r \\exp(j\\theta) - r \\exp(-j\\theta) = 2jr\\sin(\\theta)$.\nSubstituting this into the expression for $\\Delta p$:\n$$\n\\Delta p \\approx -\\frac{\\Delta D(p)}{(p-p^*)p^{-2}} = -\\frac{\\Delta d_0 + \\Delta d_1 p^{-1} + \\Delta d_2 p^{-2}}{2jr\\sin(\\theta)p^{-2}} = -\\frac{\\Delta d_0 p^2 + \\Delta d_1 p + \\Delta d_2}{2jr\\sin(\\theta)}\n$$\nThe problem asks for the magnitude of this perturbation. Taking the magnitude and using the triangle inequality:\n$$\n|\\Delta p| \\approx \\frac{|\\Delta d_0 p^2 + \\Delta d_1 p + \\Delta d_2|}{2r\\sin(\\theta)} \\le \\frac{|\\Delta d_0||p^2| + |\\Delta d_1||p| + |\\Delta d_2|}{2r\\sin(\\theta)}\n$$\nUsing $|p| = r$ and the uniform quantization error bound $|\\Delta d_k| \\le \\Delta/2$ for $k \\in \\{0, 1, 2\\}$:\n$$\n|\\Delta p| \\le \\frac{(\\Delta/2)r^2 + (\\Delta/2)r + (\\Delta/2)}{2r\\sin(\\theta)} = \\frac{(1+r+r^2)\\Delta}{4r\\sin(\\theta)}\n$$\nThis expression provides the first-order upper bound on the magnitude of the pole displacement due to coefficient quantization, as a function of $r$, $\\theta$, and $\\Delta$.\n\nNext, we derive an upper bound on the magnitude deviation from unity, $\\sup_{\\omega} \\left||\\widetilde{H}(\\exp(j\\omega))| - 1\\right|$.\nThe ideal filter is all-pass, so $|H(\\exp(j\\omega))|=1$ for all $\\omega \\in \\mathbb{R}$. This implies that for $z = \\exp(j\\omega)$, the magnitudes of the numerator and denominator are equal: $|N(z)| = |D(z)|$. The deviation of the perturbed filter's magnitude response from unity is $||\\widetilde{H}(z)| - 1|$. By the reverse triangle inequality, this deviation is bounded by the magnitude of the function's perturbation:\n$$\n||\\widetilde{H}(z)| - 1| = ||\\widetilde{H}(z)| - |H(z)|| \\le |\\widetilde{H}(z) - H(z)|\n$$\nThe perturbation in the transfer function is $\\Delta H(z) = \\widetilde{H}(z) - H(z)$:\n$$\n\\Delta H(z) = \\frac{N(z) + \\Delta N(z)}{D(z) + \\Delta D(z)} - \\frac{N(z)}{D(z)} = \\frac{D(z)\\Delta N(z) - N(z)\\Delta D(z)}{D(z)(D(z) + \\Delta D(z))}\n$$\nFor a first-order perturbation analysis, we assume the coefficient errors are small, which implies that $|\\Delta D(z)| \\ll |D(z)|$. Thus, in the denominator of the error term, we can approximate $D(z) + \\Delta D(z) \\approx D(z)$. This yields:\n$$\n\\Delta H(z) \\approx \\frac{D(z)\\Delta N(z) - N(z)\\Delta D(z)}{D(z)^2}\n$$\nTaking the magnitude and applying the triangle inequality:\n$$\n|\\Delta H(z)| \\le \\frac{|D(z)||\\Delta N(z)| + |N(z)||\\Delta D(z)|}{|D(z)|^2}\n$$\nOn the unit circle, $z=\\exp(j\\omega)$, we have $|N(z)|=|D(z)|$. The inequality simplifies to:\n$$\n|\\Delta H(z)| \\le \\frac{|D(z)|(|\\Delta N(z)| + |\\Delta D(z)|)}{|D(z)|^2} = \\frac{|\\Delta N(z)| + |\\Delta D(z)|}{|D(z)|}\n$$\nTo obtain a uniform upper bound, we must find the supremum of the right-hand side over all $\\omega$. This involves finding the maximum value of the numerator and the minimum value of the denominator.\nFor the numerator, for $z=\\exp(j\\omega)$:\n$$\n|\\Delta N(z)| = |\\Delta n_0 + \\Delta n_1 z^{-1} + \\Delta n_2 z^{-2}| \\le |\\Delta n_0| + |\\Delta n_1| + |\\Delta n_2| \\le \\frac{\\Delta}{2} + \\frac{\\Delta}{2} + \\frac{\\Delta}{2} = \\frac{3\\Delta}{2}\n$$\nSimilarly, $|\\Delta D(z)| \\le 3\\Delta/2$. The sum is bounded by $|\\Delta N(z)| + |\\Delta D(z)| \\le 3\\Delta$.\n\nFor the denominator $|D(z)|$, we must find its minimum value, $\\inf_{\\omega, \\theta} |D(\\exp(j\\omega))|$.\n$|D(\\exp(j\\omega))| = |(1-p\\exp(-j\\omega))(1-p^*\\exp(-j\\omega))| = |1-p\\exp(-j\\omega)| \\cdot |1-p^*\\exp(-j\\omega))|$.\nThe distance from the point 1 on the complex plane to a point on a circle of radius $r$ centered at the origin is minimized when the point lies on the real axis. By the reverse triangle inequality, $|1-z_0| \\ge |1|-|z_0|$. Thus, for any complex number $z_0$ with $|z_0|=r$, we have $|1-z_0| \\ge 1-r$.\nApplying this to both terms in our denominator:\n$|1-p\\exp(-j\\omega)| \\ge 1-|p| = 1-r$\n$|1-p^*\\exp(-j\\omega))| \\ge 1-|p^*| = 1-r$\nTherefore, a uniform lower bound for the denominator's magnitude is:\n$$\n|D(\\exp(j\\omega))| \\ge (1-r)^2 \\quad \\forall \\omega \\in \\mathbb{R}, \\theta \\in (0, \\pi)\n$$\nCombining the bounds for the numerator and denominator, we arrive at the uniform upper bound for the magnitude deviation:\n$$\n\\sup_{\\omega \\in \\mathbb{R}} \\left|\\,|\\widetilde{H}(\\exp(j\\omega))| - 1\\,\\right| \\le \\sup_{\\omega \\in \\mathbb{R}} |\\Delta H(\\exp(j\\omega))| \\le \\frac{3\\Delta}{(1-r)^2}\n$$\nThis expression provides the required analytic upper bound in terms of $r$ and $\\Delta$.", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{\\frac{3\\Delta}{(1-r)^2}} $$", "id": "2851748"}]}
