A fundamental property of the DFT states that for any real-valued sequence of length $N$, its transform exhibits conjugate symmetry: $P[k] = P^*[N-k]$, where $P^*$ is the complex conjugate of $P$.\nIn our case, $N=4$ and we consider $k=2$. The symmetry condition becomes $P[2] = P^*[4-2] = P^*[2]$. A complex number is equal to its own conjugate if and only if it is purely real. Therefore, $P[2]$ must be a real number.

We address them in sequence.\n\nTask 1: Derivation of Orthogonality and DFT Relationship\n\nFirst, we must derive the orthogonality relation for the complex exponential basis $\\{b_r[n]\\}$. The inner product of two complex sequences $u[n]$ and $v[n]$ over the interval $n \\in \\{0, 1, \\dots, N-1\\}$ is defined as $\\sum_{n=0}^{N-1} u[n] v^*[n]$.

We evaluate this sum for two cases.\n\nCase 1: $k = l \\pmod N$.\nIn this case, the difference $k-l$ is an integer multiple of $N$. The ratio becomes $\\alpha = \\exp\\left(j\\frac{2\\pi}{N} \\cdot (mN)\\right) = \\exp(j2\\pi m) = 1$ for some integer $m$. The summation becomes:\n$$\n\\sum_{n=0}^{N-1} 1^n = \\sum_{n=0}^{N-1} 1 = N.\n$$\n\nCase 2: $k \\neq l \\pmod N$.\nIn this case, $k-l$ is not a multiple of $N$, so the ratio $\\alpha \\neq 1$. The sum of a finite geometric series is given by the formula $\\frac{1-\\alpha^N}{1-\\alpha}$. The term $\\alpha^N$ is:\n$$\n\\alpha^N = \\left(\\exp\\left(j\\frac{2\\pi}{N}(k-l)\\right)\\right)^N = \\exp(j2\\pi(k-l)).\n$$\nSince $k$ and $l$ are integers, $k-l$ is an integer. Thus, $\\exp(j2\\pi(k-l)) = \\cos(2\\pi(k-l)) + j\\sin(2\\pi(k-l)) = 1$. The numerator of the sum formula becomes $1-1=0$. Since the denominator $1-\\alpha$ is non-zero, the sum is $0$.\n\nCombining both cases, we obtain the orthogonality relation:\n$$\n\\sum_{n=0}^{N-1} \\exp\\left(j\\frac{2\\pi}{N}(k-l)n\\right) =\n\\begin{cases}\nN, & \\text{if } k=l \\pmod N \\\\\n0, & \\text{if } k\\neq l \\pmod N\n\\end{cases}\n$$\nThis can be written compactly using the Kronecker delta as $N \\delta_{k,l}$ for $k,l \\in \\{0, 1, \\dots, N-1\\}$.\n\nNext, we use this result to show that for a sequence $x[n] = \\sum_{r=0}^{N-1} a_r \\exp\\left(j \\frac{2\\pi}{N} r n\\right)$, its DFT is $X[k] = N a_k$.\nStarting with the definition of the DFT:\n$$\nX[k] = \\sum_{n=0}^{N-1} x[n] \\exp\\left(-j \\frac{2\\pi}{N} k n\\right).\n$$\nSubstitute the given form of $x[n]$:\n$$\nX[k] = \\sum_{n=0}^{N-1} \\left( \\sum_{r=0}^{N-1} a_r \\exp\\left(j \\frac{2\\pi}{N} r n\\right) \\right) \\exp\\left(-j \\frac{2\\pi}{N} k n\\right).\n$$\nThe DFT, being a summation, is a linear operator. **The linearity property is invoked here**, allowing us to interchange the order of the two finite summations and to pull the coefficient $a_r$, which does not depend on $n$, outside the inner sum:\n$$\nX[k] = \\sum_{r=0}^{N-1} a_r \\left( \\sum_{n=0}^{N-1} \\exp\\left(j \\frac{2\\pi}{N} r n\\right) \\exp\\left(-j \\frac{2\\pi}{N} k n\\right) \\right).\n$$\nThe inner summation can be rewritten as:\n$$\n\\sum_{n=0}^{N-1} \\exp\\left(j \\frac{2\\pi}{N} (r-k) n\\right).\n$$\nThis is precisely the orthogonality sum we derived previously. It evaluates to $N$ if $r=k$ and $0$ if $r \\neq k$. Using the Kronecker delta notation, the inner sum is $N \\delta_{r,k}$.\nSubstituting this back into the expression for $X[k]$:\n$$\nX[k] = \\sum_{r=0}^{N-1} a_r (N \\delta_{r,k}).\n$$\nThe Kronecker delta $\\delta_{r,k}$ causes all terms in the summation over $r$ to become zero, except for the single term where $r=k$. The summation thus collapses to this one term:\n$$\nX[k] = a_k \\cdot N.\n$$\nThis completes the derivation required by the first task.\n\nTask 2: Application to the specific construction\n\nWe are given $N=12$ and the sequence $x[n] = \\sum_{r \\in \\mathcal{R}} a_r b_r[n]$ with $\\mathcal{R}=\\{0,3,6,9\\}$ and coefficients $a_0 = 1$, $a_3 = 2 - j$, $a_6 = -1/2$, $a_9 = 2 + j$. For all other indices $r \\in \\{0, ..., 11\\} \\setminus \\mathcal{R}$, the coefficients $a_r$ are zero.\n\nApplying the result from Task 1, $X[k] = 12 a_k$. The non-zero DFT values $X[k]$ will only occur for $k \\in \\mathcal{R}$.\nThe non-zero DFT bins are:\n$$\nX[0] = 12 a_0 = 12(1) = 12.\n$$\n$$\nX[3] = 12 a_3 = 12(2 - j) = 24 - 12j.\n$$\n$$\nX[6] = 12 a_6 = 12\\left(-\\frac{1}{2}\\right) = -6.\n$$\n$$\nX[9] = 12 a_9 = 12(2 + j) = 24 + 12j.\n$$\nFor all other $k \\in \\{1,2,4,5,7,8,10,11\\}$, $a_k=0$, so $X[k]=0$.\n\nNext, we must justify why $x[n]$ is a real-valued sequence. A time-domain sequence is real if and only if its synthesis coefficients $a_k$ (in the complex exponential basis) exhibit conjugate symmetry, i.e., $a_k = a_{N-k}^*$ for all $k$. Here, the indices are taken modulo $N$. Let us verify this condition for the given coefficients with $N=12$.\n- For $k=0$: $a_0 = a_{12-0}^* = a_0^*$. We have $a_0=1$, which is real, so $1=1^*$. This holds.\n- For $k=3$: $a_3 = a_{12-3}^* = a_9^*$. We have $a_3 = 2-j$ and $a_9 = 2+j$. $a_9^* = (2+j)^* = 2-j$. The condition $a_3 = a_9^*$ holds.\n- For $k=6$: $a_6 = a_{12-6}^* = a_6^*$. We have $a_6=-1/2$, which is real, so $-1/2=(-1/2)^*$. This holds.\n- For other $k$, for instance $k=1$, we need $a_1=a_{11}^*$. Since $a_1=0$ and $a_{11}=0$, this gives $0=0^*$, which is true. This holds for all $k$ for which $a_k=0$.\nSince the condition $a_k = a_{N-k}^*$ is satisfied for all $k \\in \\{0, 1, \\dots, 11\\}$, the sequence $x[n]$ must be real-valued.\n\nFinally, we explain and confirm the conjugate-symmetry relation for the DFT of a real sequence. For a real sequence $x[n]$, its DFT $X[k]$ must satisfy $X[k] = X_{N-k}^*$. This is a direct consequence of the DFT definition.\nWe confirm this for our computed DFT bins:\n- For $k=0$: $X[0] = X_{12-0}^* = X_0^*$. We have $X[0]=12$, which is real. $12=12^*$. Confirmed.\n- For $k=3$: $X[3] = X_{12-3}^* = X_9^*$. We have $X[3] = 24-12j$ and $X[9]=24+12j$. Taking the conjugate of $X[9]$ gives $X[9]^* = (24+12j)^* = 24-12j$. Thus, $X[3]=X_9^*$. Confirmed.\n- For $k=6$: $X[6] = X_{12-6}^* = X_6^*$. We have $X[6]=-6$, which is real. $-6=(-6)^*$. Confirmed.\nThe conjugate symmetry property is fully confirmed for the computed DFT.\n\nThe problem requires reporting the value of $|X[3]|$.\n$$\n|X[3]| = |24 - 12j| = \\sqrt{24^2 + (-12)^2} = \\sqrt{576 + 144} = \\sqrt{720}.\n$$\nTo simplify the radical, we find the largest perfect square factor of $720$.\n$$\n720 = 72 \\times 10 = (8 \\times 9) \\times (2 \\times 5) = 16 \\times 9 \\times 5 = 144 \\times 5.\n$$\nTherefore, the exact value is:\n$$\n|X[3]| = \\sqrt{144 \\times 5} = \\sqrt{144} \\sqrt{5} = 12\\sqrt{5}.\n$$", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{12\\sqrt{5}}\n$$", "id": "2896294"}, {"introduction": "The properties of the DFT are not merely theoretical; they are indispensable tools for solving practical engineering problems.

We seek a sequence $x[n]$ that is real-valued for $n \\in \\{0, 1, \\dots, 7\\}$. Let its DFT be $Y[k]$. The condition that $x[n]$ is real imposes Hermitian symmetry on its DFT: $Y[k] = Y^{*}[(N-k) \\bmod N]$.

The cost function is a sum of non-negative squared-magnitude terms. It can be minimized by setting each term to zero. This requires that the DFT of our solution, $Y[k]$, must match the given values $X[k]$ for all $k \\in \\mathcal{S}$.\nThus, any solution that minimizes the least-squares criterion must satisfy:\n$Y[0] = X[0] = 4$\n$Y[1] = X[1] = 2 - j2$\n$Y[3] = X[3] = 2$\n$Y[4] = X[4] = 0$\n\nThese constraints must be compatible with the Hermitian symmetry imposed by the realness of $x[n]$.

Since $a$ and $b$ are real, the minimum value of $a^2+b^2$ is $0$, which occurs if and only if $a=0$ and $b=0$.\nThis proves that the unique minimal-energy solution sets the unspecified unique-half bin, $Y[2]$, to the specific value $0 + j0 = 0$.\n\nTherefore, for the unique minimum-energy real sequence $x[n]$, its DFT $Y[k]$ is completely determined as:\n$Y[0] = 4$\n$Y[1] = 2 - j2$\n$Y[2] = 0$\n$Y[3] = 2$\n$Y[4] = 0$\n$Y[5] = 2$\n$Y[6] = 0$\n$Y[7] = 2 + j2$\n\nFinally, we compute the value of the time-domain sample $x[2]$ using the inverse DFT formula:\n$$\nx[n] = \\frac{1}{N}\\sum_{k=0}^{N-1} Y[k] \\exp\\left(j\\,\\frac{2\\pi}{N}kn\\right)\n$$\nFor $N=8$ and $n=2$, this becomes:\n$$\nx[2] = \\frac{1}{8}\\sum_{k=0}^{7} Y[k] \\exp\\left(j\\,\\frac{2\\pi}{8}k \\cdot 2\\right) = \\frac{1}{8}\\sum_{k=0}^{7} Y[k] \\exp\\left(j\\,\\frac{\\pi k}{2}\\right)\n$$\nWe evaluate the sum term by term:\n\\begin{align*} \\sum_{k=0}^{7} Y[k] \\exp\\left(j\\,\\frac{\\pi k}{2}\\right) &= Y[0]\\exp(0) + Y[1]\\exp\\left(j\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\right) + Y[2]\\exp(j\\pi) + Y[3]\\exp\\left(j\\frac{3\\pi}{2}\\right) \\\\ & \\quad + Y[4]\\exp(j2\\pi) + Y[5]\\exp\\left(j\\frac{5\\pi}{2}\\right) + Y[6]\\exp(j3\\pi) + Y[7]\\exp\\left(j\\frac{7\\pi}{2}\\right) \\\\ &= 4(1) + (2 - j2)(j) + (0)(-1) + (2)(-j) \\\\ & \\quad + (0)(1) + (2)(j) + (0)(-1) + (2 + j2)(-j) \\\\ &= 4 + (2j - 2j^2) + 0 - 2j + 0 + 2j + 0 + (-2j - 2j^2) \\\\ &= 4 + (2j + 2) - 2j + 2j + (-2j + 2) \\\\ &= (4+2+2) + (2j-2j+2j-2j) \\\\ &= 8 + 0j \\\\ &= 8 \\end{align*}\nSubstituting this sum back into the expression for $x[2]$:\n$$\nx[2] = \\frac{1}{8}(8) = 1\n$$\nThe value of the sample $x[2]$ for the unique minimal-energy sequence is $1$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{1}\n$$", "id": "2896328"}]}
