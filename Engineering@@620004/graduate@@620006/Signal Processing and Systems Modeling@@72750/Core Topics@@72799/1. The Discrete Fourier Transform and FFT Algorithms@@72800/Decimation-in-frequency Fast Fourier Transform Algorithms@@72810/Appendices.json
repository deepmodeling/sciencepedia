The implementation is specified as in-place, and the butterfly operations are organized into contiguous groups.\n\nThe decimation-in-frequency algorithm works by recursively splitting a Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) of size $M$ into two DFTs of size $M/2$. At each stage of the recursion, a set of butterfly operations is performed. For an $N$-point radix-$2$ DIF FFT, there are $\\log_2(N)$ stages.
