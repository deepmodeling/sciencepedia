Let $p = (n-m) \\pmod{N}$. This implies $m = (n-p) \\pmod{N}$. As $m$ ranges over a complete period from $0$ to $N-1$, the variable $p$ also ranges over a complete period. Therefore, we can replace the summation over $m$ with a summation over $p$:\n$$R_{xx}[k] = \\sum_{n=0}^{N-1} x[n] \\sum_{p=0}^{N-1} x^{\\ast}[p] \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\mathrm{j}2\\pi k(n-p)}{N}\\right)$$\nWe can separate the exponential term:\n$$R_{xx}[k] = \\sum_{n=0}^{N-1} x[n] \\sum_{p=0}^{N-1} x^{\\ast}[p] \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\mathrm{j}2\\pi kn}{N}\\right) \\exp\\left(\\frac{\\mathrm{j}2\\pi kp}{N}\\right)$$\nRearranging the terms by factoring out expressions that do not depend on the inner summation variable $p$:\n$$R_{xx}[k] = \\sum_{n=0}^{N-1} x[n] \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\mathrm{j}2\\pi kn}{N}\\right) \\left( \\sum_{p=0}^{N-1} x^{\\ast}[p] \\exp\\left(\\frac{\\mathrm{j}2\\pi kp}{N}\\right) \\right)$$\nWe recognize the first part of the expression as the definition of the DFT of $x[n]$, which is $X[k]$:\n$$\\sum_{n=0}^{N-1} x[n] \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\mathrm{j}2\\pi kn}{N}\\right) = X[k]$$\nThe second part of the expression, the term in parentheses, can be related to $X[k]$ as well.
