The convolution theorem for the DFT states that the DFT of the circular convolution of two signals is the product of their individual DFTs. Let $x_N[n]$ and $h_N[n]$ be two signals of length $N$. Their $N$-point circular convolution is defined as:\n$$(x_N \\circledast_N h_N)[n] = \\sum_{m=0}^{N-1} x_N[m] h_N[(n-m) \\pmod N]$$\nThe theorem states:\n$$DFT\\{(x_N \\circledast_N h_N)[n]\\} = X_N[k] H_N[k]$$\nThis implies that we can compute circular convolution by transforming the signals to the frequency domain, multiplying them, and transforming back:\n$$(x_N \\circledast_N h_N)[n] = IDFT\\{X_N[k] H_N[k]\\}$$\nThe core of the procedure is to use this property to compute linear convolution.\n\nHere is the step-by-step procedure:\n\n**(i) Minimal Transform Length and (iii) Zero-Padding to Avoid Aliasing**\n\nLet the signal $x[n]$ have support starting at index $n_{x,min}$ and ending at $n_{x,max}$. The length of the signal is $L_x = n_{x,max} - n_{x,min} + 1$. Similarly, let $h[n]$ have support on $[n_{h,min}, n_{h,max}]$ and length $L_h = n_{h,max} - n_{h,min} + 1$.\n\nThe linear convolution $y[n] = (x * h)[n]$ is a finite-length signal. Its support starts at $n_{y,min} = n_{x,min} + n_{h,min}$ and ends at $n_{y,max} = n_{x,max} + n_{h,max}$. The length of the resulting signal $y[n]$ is $L_y = n_{y,max} - n_{y,min} + 1 = L_x + L_h - 1$.\n\nCircular convolution of length $N$ is related to linear convolution by the expression:\n$$(x_N \\circledast_N h_N)[n] = \\sum_{m=-\\infty}^{\\infty} y[n-mN]$$\nThis shows that the circular convolution is a time-aliased version of the linear convolution. To ensure that the result of an $N$-point circular convolution is identical to the linear convolution for its entire duration, we must prevent the non-zero parts of the shifted copies $y[n-mN]$ from overlapping. Since the linear convolution $y[n]$ has a length of $L_y = L_x + L_h - 1$, we must choose a transform length $N$ such that $N \\ge L_y$.\n\nThe minimal valid DFT length is therefore:\n$$N_{min} = L_x + L_h - 1$$\nTo use an $N$-point DFT where $N \\ge N_{min}$, we must extend the original signals $x[n]$ and $h[n]$ to this length. This is accomplished by zero-padding.\n\n**(ii) Reindexing to Zero-Based Arrays**\n\nThe DFT is formally defined for signals on the index interval $[0, N-1]$. Our signals $x[n]$ and $h[n]$ have arbitrary supports. We must re-index them to create new zero-based signals, which we will denote as $x_p[n]$ and $h_p[n]$, of length $N$.\n\nFor $x[n]$ supported on $[n_{x,min}, n_{x,max}]$, we create $x_p[n]$ of length $N$:\n$$x_p[n] = \\begin{cases} x[n + n_{x,min}] & \\text{for } 0 \\le n < L_x \\\\ 0 & \\text{for } L_x \\le n < N \\end{cases}$$\nSimilarly, for $h[n]$ supported on $[n_{h,min}, n_{h,max}]$, we create $h_p[n]$ of length $N$:\n$$h_p[n] = \\begin{cases} h[n + n_{h,min}] & \\text{for } 0 \\le n < L_h \\\\ 0 & \\text{for } L_h \\le n < N \\end{cases}$$\nThese padded signals $x_p[n]$ and $h_p[n]$ are the inputs to the DFT.\n\nThe full computational sequence is:\n1. Compute the $N$-point DFTs: $X_p[k] = DFT\\{x_p[n]\\}$ and $H_p[k] = DFT\\{h_p[n]\\}$.\n2. Multiply in the frequency domain: $Y_p[k] = X_p[k] H_p[k]$.\n3. Compute the $N$-point inverse DFT: $y_p[n] = IDFT\\{Y_p[k]\\}$. The resulting signal $y_p[n]$ contains the values of the linear convolution for $n \\in [0, L_y-1]$.\n\n**(iv) Mapping the Inverse-Transform Result Back to Original Time Indices**\n\nThe computed signal $y_p[n]$ is supported on $[0, N-1]$, with its non-zero part contained within $[0, L_y-1]$. This signal represents the values of the true linear convolution output $y[n]$, but on a zero-based index. We must map these values back to the correct support of $y[n]$, which is $[n_{y,min}, n_{y,max}]$.\n\nThe starting index of the convolution is $n_{y,min} = n_{x,min} + n_{h,min}$. The mapping is a simple index shift:\n$$y[n] = y_p[n - n_{y,min}] = y_p[n - (n_{x,min} + n_{h,min})]$$\nThis provides the final linear convolution result $y[n]$ on its correct support interval.\n\n**Application to the Specific Problem**\n\nWe are given:\n- $x[n]$ supported on $[-2, 1]$ with values $\\{x[-2]=2, x[-1]=-1, x[0]=3, x[1]=1\\}$.\n- $h[n]$ supported on $[3, 6]$ with values $\\{h[3]=1, h[4]=0, h[5]=-2, h[6]=4\\}$.\n\nFirst, we determine the properties of the signals:\n- For $x[n]$: $n_{x,min} = -2$, $n_{x,max} = 1$. The length is $L_x = 1 - (-2) + 1 = 4$.\n- For $h[n]$: $n_{h,min} = 3$, $n_{h,max} = 6$. The length is $L_h = 6 - 3 + 1 = 4$.\n\nNext, we apply the procedure:\n\n1.  **Determine Minimal DFT Length:**\n    $N_{min} = L_x + L_h - 1 = 4 + 4 - 1 = 7$. We will use $N=7$.\n\n2.  **Reindex and Pad:**\n    We create zero-based signals $x_p[n]$ and $h_p[n]$ of length $N=7$.\n    - For $x_p[n]$, the values are $x[n-2]$ for $n \\in [0,3]$:\n      $x_p[0] = x[-2] = 2$\n      $x_p[1] = x[-1] = -1$\n      $x_p[2] = x[0] = 3$\n      $x_p[3] = x[1] = 1$\n      $x_p[4]=x_p[5]=x_p[6]=0$.\n      Thus, the sequence is $x_p = \\{2, -1, 3, 1, 0, 0, 0\\}$.\n    - For $h_p[n]$, the values are $h[n+3]$ for $n \\in [0,3]$:\n      $h_p[0] = h[3] = 1$\n      $h_p[1] = h[4] = 0$\n      $h_p[2] = h[5] = -2$\n      $h_p[3] = h[6] = 4$\n      $h_p[4]=h_p[5]=h_p[6]=0$.\n      Thus, the sequence is $h_p = \\{1, 0, -2, 4, 0, 0, 0\\}$.\n\n3.  **Determine Output Mapping:**\n    We need to compute the sample $y[4]$. First, we find the support of the output $y[n]$.\n    $n_{y,min} = n_{x,min} + n_{h,min} = -2 + 3 = 1$.\n    The mapping from the computed sequence $y_p[n]$ to $y[n]$ is $y[n] = y_p[n-1]$.\n    Therefore, the desired sample $y[4]$ corresponds to $y_p[4-1] = y_p[3]$.\n\n4.  **Compute the Required Sample:**\n    The sequence $y_p[n]$ is the result of the $7$-point circular convolution of $x_p[n]$ and $h_p[n]$. We compute $y_p[3]$ directly from this definition:\n    $$y_p[3] = (x_p \\circledast_7 h_p)[3] = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} x_p[m] h_p[(3-m) \\pmod 7]$$\n    We expand the sum term by term for $m=0, 1, ..., 6$. The sum is non-zero only for $m \\in [0,3]$ since $x_p[m]=0$ for $m > 3$.\n    - $m=0$: $x_p[0] h_p[(3-0) \\pmod 7] = x_p[0] h_p[3] = (2)(4) = 8$.\n    - $m=1$: $x_p[1] h_p[(3-1) \\pmod 7] = x_p[1] h_p[2] = (-1)(-2) = 2$.\n    - $m=2$: $x_p[2] h_p[(3-2) \\pmod 7] = x_p[2] h_p[1] = (3)(0) = 0$.\n    - $m=3$: $x_p[3] h_p[(3-3) \\pmod 7] = x_p[3] h_p[0] = (1)(1) = 1$.\n    - $m=4,5,6$: The terms are zero because $x_p[m]=0$.\n\n    Summing the contributions:\n    $$y_p[3] = 8 + 2 + 0 + 1 = 11$$\n    Since $y[4] = y_p[3]$, the final answer is $11$.

According to the provided runtime model, the cost of one such FFT is:\n$$C_{DFT}(N_1) \\approx c \\, N_1 \\log_2 N_1$$\nThe total cost for convolution is therefore:\n$$C_{conv}(N_1) \\approx 3 c \\, N_1 \\log_2 N_1$$\nSubstituting $N_1 = 100000 = 10^5$:\n$$C_{conv}(N_1) \\approx 3 c \\cdot 10^5 \\cdot \\log_2(10^5) = 3 c \\cdot 10^5 \\cdot 5 \\log_2(10)$$\nUsing the approximation $\\log_2(10) \\approx 3.3219$:\n$$C_{conv}(N_1) \\approx 15 c \\cdot 10^5 \\cdot (3.3219) \\approx 4.983 \\times 10^6 \\cdot c$$\n\n**Case 2: Prime Length $N_2 = 100003$**\nFor a prime length such as $N_2 = 100003$, the DFT must be computed using an algorithm like Bluestein’s. The cost model for one such DFT is given as:\n$$C_{DFT}(N_2) \\approx 3 c \\, P \\log_2 P$$\nwhere $P$ is the smallest power of two satisfying $P \\geq 2N_2 - 1$. First, we compute the required value of $P$:\n$$2N_2 - 1 = 2(100003) - 1 = 200006 - 1 = 200005$$\nWe must find the smallest integer $k$ such that $2^k \\geq 200005$.\nWe know $2^{17} = 131072$ and $2^{18} = 262144$.\nTherefore, the smallest power of two is $P = 2^{18} = 262144$.\nThe cost of a single prime-length DFT of size $N_2$ is:\n$$C_{DFT}(N_2) \\approx 3 c \\cdot P \\cdot \\log_2(P) = 3 c \\cdot 262144 \\cdot \\log_2(2^{18}) = 3 c \\cdot 262144 \\cdot 18 = 14155776c$$\nThe total cost for convolution using this prime length is three times this amount:\n$$C_{conv}(N_2) \\approx 3 \\cdot C_{DFT}(N_2) = 3 \\cdot (3 c \\, P \\log_2 P) = 9 c \\, P \\log_2 P$$\n$$C_{conv}(N_2) \\approx 9 c \\cdot 262144 \\cdot 18 = 42467328c \\approx 4.247 \\times 10^7 \\cdot c$$\n\n**Comparison of Runtimes**\nTo quantify the difference, we compute the ratio of the two costs:\n$$\\frac{C_{conv}(N_2)}{C_{conv}(N_1)} = \\frac{9 c \\, P \\log_2 P}{3 c \\, N_1 \\log_2 N_1} = \\frac{3 P \\log_2 P}{N_1 \\log_2 N_1}$$\nSubstituting the calculated values:\n$$\\frac{C_{conv}(N_2)}{C_{conv}(N_1)} \\approx \\frac{4.247 \\times 10^7 \\cdot c}{4.983 \\times 10^6 \\cdot c} \\approx 8.52$$\nThis result indicates that choosing the prime length $N_2$ makes the computation approximately $8.5$ times slower than choosing the highly composite length $N_1$. In other words, choosing $N_1$ yields a speedup of roughly a factor of $8.5$.\n\n**Evaluation of Options**\n\n-   **A. Choosing $N_1 = 100000$ instead of $N_2 = 100003$ yields roughly an order-of-magnitude speedup (on the order of $8\\times$ to $9\\times$) in the FFT component, which directly translates to a similar speedup in the overall convolution runtime at these sizes.**\n    Our calculation shows a speedup factor of approximately $8.5$, which is squarely in the range of \"$8\\times$ to $9\\times$\". This is reasonably described as \"roughly an order-of-magnitude\". The problem states that the total convolution cost is dominated by the FFT costs, so the speedup in the FFT component directly determines the overall speedup. This statement is consistent with our derivation.\n    **Verdict: Correct.**\n\n-   **B. Both choices yield essentially identical runtimes because both are $\\Theta(N \\log N)$; asymptotically and practically there is no significant difference at these sizes.**\n    This is a naive interpretation of asymptotic notation. While many DFT algorithms are broadly categorized as $\\Theta(N \\log N)$, the constant factors hidden by the notation are critically important in practice. The cost model for the prime-length DFT is not $\\Theta(N_2 \\log N_2)$, but rather $\\Theta(P \\log P)$ where $P$ is about twice $N_2$, and it carries a larger multiplicative constant ($9c$ in the total convolution cost vs $3c$). A factor of $8.5$ difference in runtime is by no means \"essentially identical\".\n    **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n-   **C. The prime choice $N_2$ is faster because it avoids mixed-radix factorization overhead and reduces the number of twiddle-factor multiplications.**\n    This claim is contrary to established facts of FFT algorithms and directly contradicted by our calculation. Bluestein's algorithm for prime lengths introduces significant computational overhead by converting a DFT into a convolution, which is then solved using larger FFTs. It is substantially slower than a direct, highly optimized FFT on a smooth-length sequence. The premise of the option is false.\n    **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n-   **D. Any difference in FFT speed is negligible because the pointwise multiplication dominates the cost at these sizes, so the overall convolution runtime is nearly the same for $N_1$ and $N_2$.**\n    This statement directly contradicts a premise of the problem: \"The $O(N)$ costs of pointwise multiplications ... are negligible compared to the FFT costs\". The cost of FFTs, being $\\Theta(N \\log N)$, grows faster than the $\\Theta(N)$ cost of multiplication and is overwhelmingly dominant for large $N$ such as those considered here.\n    **Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2880481"}]}
