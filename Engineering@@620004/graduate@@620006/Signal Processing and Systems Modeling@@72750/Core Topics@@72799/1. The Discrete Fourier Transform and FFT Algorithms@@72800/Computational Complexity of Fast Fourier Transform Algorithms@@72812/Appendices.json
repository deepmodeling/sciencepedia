We proceed with the analysis.\n\nThe problem requires a derivation of computational costs for two methods of computing the DFT for a sequence of length $N=8$, and a detailed breakdown of the radix-$2$ decimation-in-time (DIT) FFT algorithm.\n\nThe cost model is explicitly defined:\n1.  A complex addition or subtraction costs $1$ complex addition.\n2.  A multiplication of a complex number by any twiddle factor $W_N^m$ costs $1$ complex multiplication, irrespective of the value of $m$. Simplifications for $m=0$ or other special cases are forbidden.\n\nLet $A$ denote the total count of complex additions and $M$ denote the total count of complex multiplications.\n\n**Part 1: Direct DFT Computation Cost**\n\nThe definition of the DFT is given as:\n$$\nX[k] = \\sum_{n=0}^{N-1} x[n] W_{N}^{kn}\n$$\nFor a fixed output index $k$, the computation of $X[k]$ involves a sum of $N$ terms.\nEach term, $x[n]W_N^{kn}$, requires one complex multiplication. Given the strict cost model, this is true even for $kn=0$ or other integer multiples of $N$. Thus, for each value of $k$, there are $N$ complex multiplications.\nThe summation of these $N$ complex terms requires $N-1$ complex additions.\n\nSince $k$ ranges from $0$ to $N-1$, there are $N$ such output values to compute. Therefore, the total costs for the direct DFT computation are:\n- Total complex multiplications: $M_{\\text{DFT}} = N \\times N = N^2$.\n- Total complex additions: $A_{\\text{DFT}} = N \\times (N-1)$.\n\nFor $N=8$:\n$$\nM_{\\text{DFT}} = 8^2 = 64\n$$\n$$\nA_{\\text{DFT}} = 8 \\times (8-1) = 8 \\times 7 = 56\n$$\n\n**Part 2: Radix-2 DIT FFT Analysis**\n\nThe radix-$2$ FFT algorithm recursively breaks down a DFT of size $N$ into two DFTs of size $N/2$. For $N=2^v$, this results in $v = \\log_2(N)$ stages of computation. For $N=8$, we have $\\log_2(8) = 3$ stages.\n\nThe core computation in each stage is the \"butterfly\" operation, which combines two intermediate values, say $A$ and $B$, to produce two new values, $A'$ and $B'$:\n$$\nA' = A + W_N^e B\n$$\n$$\nB' = A - W_N^e B\n$$\nwhere $W_N^e$ is the appropriate twiddle factor. This computation can be implemented by first calculating the product $P = W_N^e B$, which costs $1$ complex multiplication. Then, $A' = A + P$ and $B' = A - P$ are computed, which costs $2$ complex additions. Thus, each butterfly operation requires exactly $1$ complex multiplication and $2$ complex additions under the specified cost model.\n\nIn a radix-$2$ FFT of size $N$, each of the $\\log_2(N)$ stages consists of $N/2$ such butterfly operations.\n\n**Butterfly Details for $N=8$ DIT-FFT**\n\nThe DIT-FFT algorithm requires the input sequence $x[n]$ to be reordered by bit-reversing the indices.

We are to compare a single radix-$4$ decimation-in-frequency (DIF) stage with two consecutive radix-$2$ DIF stages, for a Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) of length $N=4M$ where $\\gcd(M,6)=1$.\n\nThe DFT of a sequence $x[n]$ of length $N$ is defined as:\n$$\nX[k] = \\sum_{n=0}^{N-1} x[n] W_N^{nk}, \\quad k = 0, 1, \\dots, N-1\n$$\nwhere $W_N = \\exp(-j2\\pi/N)$ is the primitive $N$-th root of unity. The specified cost model counts complex additions (or subtractions) and non-trivial complex multiplications. Multiplications by $1, -1, j, -j$ are considered trivial (zero cost). This implies that a multiplication by $W_N^r$ is trivial if the exponent $r$ is an integer multiple of $N/4$.\n\nFirst, we analyze the single radix-$4$ DIF stage.\nA radix-$4$ DIF stage decomposes an $N$-point DFT into four $N/4$-point DFTs. The underlying principle involves rewriting the DFT formula to isolate four sub-problems. The output samples $X[k]$ are partitioned according to $k \\pmod 4$. For $q=0,1,2,3$, the components $X[4r+q]$ are given by the $r$-th output of an $N/4$-point DFT operating on a sequence derived from $x[n]$. The pre-processing step for a DIF algorithm involves a \"butterfly\" operation followed by multiplication with \"twiddle factors\".\n\nFor each $n \\in \\{0, 1, \\dots, N/4-1\\}$, a $4$-point butterfly computes four values from four input samples $x[n], x[n+N/4], x[n+N/2], x[n+3N/4]$. Let these be $a,b,c,d$ respectively. The butterfly output is a $4$-point DFT of these samples:\n\\begin{align*}\nd_0[n] &= (a+c) + (b+d) \\\\\nd_1[n] &= (a-c) - j(b-d) \\\\\nd_2[n] &= (a+c) - (b+d) \\\\\nd_3[n] &= (a-c) + j(b-d)\n\\end{align*}\nTo compute these four quantities, one first calculates $(a+c)$, $(a-c)$, $(b+d)$, and $(b-d)$, requiring $4$ complex additions. Then, four more additions are required to combine these intermediate results. Total additions per butterfly: $4+4=8$. Multiplications by $\\pm j$ are trivial and thus have zero cost.\nSince there are $N/4$ such butterflies (for $n=0, \\dots, N/4 - 1$), the total number of additions is $C_{add, \\text{butter}}^{(R4)} = 8 \\times (N/4) = 2N$.\n\nFollowing the butterfly stage, three of the four output streams are multiplied by twiddle factors $W_N^{nq}$:\n\\begin{align*}\ng_0[n] &= d_0[n] \\\\\ng_1[n] &= d_1[n] W_N^n \\\\\ng_2[n] &= d_2[n] W_N^{2n} \\\\\ng_3[n] &= d_3[n] W_N^{3n}\n\\end{align*}\nfor $n = 0, \\dots, N/4-1$. This requires $3 \\times (N/4) = 3N/4$ complex multiplications in total. We must count how many are non-trivial. A multiplication by $W_N^r$ is trivial if $r$ is a multiple of $N/4$.\n\\begin{itemize}\n    \\item For $W_N^n$: The exponent $n$ is in the range $[0, N/4-1]$. It is a multiple of $N/4$ only for $n=0$. This gives $1$ trivial multiplication.\n    \\item For $W_N^{2n}$: The exponent $2n$ is a multiple of $N/4$ if $2n = k \\cdot (N/4)$ for some integer $k$. This is $8n=kN$. Since $N=4M$ with $M$ odd, we have $8n=k(4M)$, or $2n=kM$. As $\\gcd(M,2)=1$, $n$ must be a multiple of $M=N/4$. In the range $n \\in [0, N/4-1]$, only $n=0$ satisfies this. This gives $1$ trivial multiplication.\n    \\item For $W_N^{3n}$: The exponent $3n$ is a multiple of $N/4=M$. So $3n=kM$. Given $\\gcd(M,6)=1$, we have $\\gcd(M,3)=1$. Thus, $n$ must be a multiple of $M=N/4$. Again, only $n=0$ is possible. This gives $1$ trivial multiplication.\n\\end{itemize}\nThe total number of trivial multiplications is $1+1+1=3$. The number of non-trivial multiplications for the radix-$4$ stage is $C_{mult}^{(R4)} = 3N/4 - 3$. The total number of additions is $C_{add}^{(R4)} = 2N$.\n\nNext, we analyze two consecutive radix-$2$ DIF stages.\nA single radix-$2$ DIF stage on an $L$-point sequence involves:\n\\begin{itemize}\n    \\item $L/2$ additions for $x[n]+x[n+L/2]$ and $L/2$ additions for $x[n]-x[n+L/2]$. Total: $L$ additions.\n    \\item $L/2$ twiddle factor multiplications, $(x[n]-x[n+L/2])W_L^n$, for $n=0, \\dots, L/2-1$.\n\\end{itemize}\nFor our problem, we have two stages.\nStage 1: A single radix-$2$ stage on the $N$-point input sequence.\n- Additions: $C_{add, 1}^{(R2)} = N$.\n- Multiplications: $N/2$ twiddle factors $W_N^n$ for $n=0, \\dots, N/2-1$. These are trivial if $n$ is a multiple of $N/4$. In the given range, this occurs for $n=0$ and $n=N/4$. So, there are $2$ trivial multiplications.\n- Non-trivial multiplications: $C_{mult, 1}^{(R2)} = N/2 - 2$.\n\nStage 2: This stage applies a radix-$2$ decomposition to each of the two $N/2$-point outputs from Stage 1. This means two parallel radix-$2$ stages, each operating on a sequence of length $L=N/2$.\n- Additions: For each $N/2$-point stage, there are $N/2$ additions. Since there are two such stages, the total is $C_{add, 2}^{(R2)} = 2 \\times (N/2) = N$.\n- Multiplications: Each stage requires $(N/2)/2 = N/4$ multiplications. Total for two stages is $2 \\times (N/4) = N/2$. The twiddle factors are $W_{N/2}^m = W_N^{2m}$ for $m=0, \\dots, N/4-1$.\n- A multiplication is trivial if the exponent $2m$ is a multiple of $N/4$. As established in the radix-$4$ analysis, this occurs only for $m=0$. Each of the two parallel stages has one trivial multiplication (at $m=0$). Thus, there are $2$ trivial multiplications in total for Stage 2.\n- Non-trivial multiplications: $C_{mult, 2}^{(R2)} = N/2 - 2$.\n\nTotal for two consecutive radix-$2$ stages:\n- Total additions: $C_{add}^{(R2x2)} = C_{add, 1}^{(R2)} + C_{add, 2}^{(R2)} = N + N = 2N$.\n- Total non-trivial multiplications: $C_{mult}^{(R2x2)} = C_{mult, 1}^{(R2)} + C_{mult, 2}^{(R2)} = (N/2 - 2) + (N/2 - 2) = N - 4$.\n\nFinally, we compute the net savings in non-trivial complex multiplications of the radix-$4$ stage relative to the two radix-$2$ stages.\n$$\n\\text{Savings} = C_{mult}^{(R2x2)} - C_{mult}^{(R4)}\n$$\n$$\n\\text{Savings} = (N-4) - \\left(\\frac{3N}{4} - 3\\right)\n$$\n$$\n\\text{Savings} = N - \\frac{3N}{4} - 4 + 3 = \\frac{N}{4} - 1\n$$\nThis expression represents the reduction in computational cost, in terms of non-trivial multiplications, achieved by using a native radix-$4$ decomposition instead of a functionally equivalent pair of radix-$2$ decompositions.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\frac{N}{4} - 1}\n$$", "id": "2859684"}, {"introduction": "Theoretical operation counts provide a guide to an algorithm's efficiency, but actual performance on a physical machine is also governed by factors like memory access patterns.

Penalty incurred.\nThus, $m_{2}=2$.\n\nSubstituting the values:\n$4.10 - 3.74 = 120 \\cdot b \\cdot (2 - 1)$\n$0.36 = 120 b$\n$b = \\frac{0.36}{120} = 0.003$.\n\n**Task 2: Determination of parameters $c, a_{2}, a_{3}, a_{5}$**\nWe use the known value of $b$ and four measurements to form a system of four linear equations. The model can be written as $T - Nbm = c + N \\sum_{r} a_{r}s_{r}$.\n\n1. $N=120$, order $\\langle 2,2,2,3,5\\rangle$: $s_2=3, s_3=1, s_5=1$, $m=1$, $T=3.74$.\n$3.74 - 120(0.003)(1) = c + 120(3a_{2} + a_{3} + a_{5})$\n$3.38 = c + 360a_{2} + 120a_{3} + 120a_{5}$ (I)\n\n2. $N=90$, order $\\langle 2,3,3,5\\rangle$: $s_2=1, s_3=2, s_5=1$, $T=2.63$. Strides: $2$, $2\\cdot3=6$, $2\\cdot3\\cdot3=18 > 16$. So $m=1$.\n$2.63 - 90(0.003)(1) = c + 90(a_{2} + 2a_{3} + a_{5})$\n$2.36 = c + 90a_{2} + 180a_{3} + 90a_{5}$ (II)\n\n3. $N=150$, order $\\langle 2,3,5,5\\rangle$: $s_2=1, s_3=1, s_5=2$, $T=4.97$. Strides: $2$, $2\\cdot3=6$, $2\\cdot3\\cdot5=30 > 16$. So $m=1$.\n$4.97 - 150(0.003)(1) = c + 150(a_{2} + a_{3} + 2a_{5})$\n$4.52 = c + 150a_{2} + 150a_{3} + 300a_{5}$ (III)\n\n4. $N=180$, order $\\langle 2,2,3,3,5\\rangle$: $s_2=2, s_3=2, s_5=1$, $T=5.96$. Strides: $2$, $2\\cdot2=4$, $2\\cdot2\\cdot3=12$, $2\\cdot2\\cdot3\\cdot3=36 > 16$. So $m=1$.\n$5.96 - 180(0.003)(1) = c + 180(2a_{2} + 2a_{3} + a_{5})$\n$5.42 = c + 360a_{2} + 360a_{3} + 180a_{5}$ (IV)\n\nWe solve this system. Subtracting (I) from (IV):\n$(c + 360a_{2} + 360a_{3} + 180a_{5}) - (c + 360a_{2} + 120a_{3} + 120a_{5}) = 5.42 - 3.38$\n$240a_{3} + 60a_{5} = 2.04 \\implies 4a_{3} + a_{5} = 0.034$. (A)\n\nSubtract (II) from (I), (III) and (IV) to eliminate $c$:\n(I)-(II): $270a_{2} - 60a_{3} + 30a_{5} = 1.02 \\implies 9a_{2} - 2a_{3} + a_{5} = 0.034$. (B)\n(IV)-(II): $270a_{2} + 180a_{3} + 90a_{5} = 3.06 \\implies 3a_{2} + 2a_{3} + a_{5} = 0.034$. (C)\n\nFrom (B) and (C): $9a_{2} - 2a_{3} + a_{5} = 3a_{2} + 2a_{3} + a_{5} \\implies 6a_{2} = 4a_{3} \\implies a_{3} = 1.5 a_{2}$.\nSubstitute $a_{3}=1.5a_2$ into (A): $4(1.5a_{2}) + a_{5} = 0.034 \\implies 6a_{2} + a_{5} = 0.034 \\implies a_{5} = 0.034 - 6a_{2}$.\nSubstitute $a_3$ and $a_5$ into (C):\n$3a_{2} + 2(1.5a_{2}) + (0.034 - 6a_{2}) = 0.034$\n$3a_{2} + 3a_{2} - 6a_{2} + 0.034 = 0.034$, which gives $0=0$. This means the equations are not independent, indicating I must use the third equation. Let's use (III)-(II):\n(III)-(II): $60a_{2} - 30a_{3} + 210a_{5} = 2.16 \\implies 2a_{2} - a_{3} + 7a_{5} = 0.072$. (D)\n\nNow substitute $a_3=1.5a_2$ and $a_5=0.034-6a_2$ into (D):\n$2a_{2} - (1.5a_{2}) + 7(0.034 - 6a_{2}) = 0.072$\n$0.5a_{2} + 0.238 - 42a_{2} = 0.072$\n$-41.5a_{2} = 0.072 - 0.238 = -0.166$\n$a_{2} = \\frac{0.166}{41.5} = 0.004$.\n\nFrom this, we find:\n$a_{3} = 1.5 \\cdot a_{2} = 1.5 \\cdot 0.004 = 0.006$.\n$a_{5} = 0.034 - 6 \\cdot a_{2} = 0.034 - 6 \\cdot 0.004 = 0.034 - 0.024 = 0.010$.\n\nFinally, substitute these into (II) to find $c$:\n$2.36 = c + 90(0.004) + 180(0.006) + 90(0.010)$\n$2.36 = c + 0.36 + 1.08 + 0.90$\n$2.36 = c + 2.34 \\implies c = 0.02$.\n\nThe fitted parameters are: $c=0.02$, $a_{2}=0.004$, $a_{3}=0.006$, $a_{5}=0.010$, and $b=0.003$.\n\n**Task 3: Prediction of minimum time for $N_{\\text{new}}=360$**\nFor $N_{\\text{new}}=360=2^{3} \\cdot 3^{2} \\cdot 5^{1}$, we have $s_2=3, s_3=2, s_5=1$.\nThe total execution time is given by:\n$T(360, \\text{plan}) = c + 360(3a_{2} + 2a_{3} + a_{5}) + 360 b m(360, \\text{plan}; 16)$.\n\nTo achieve the minimum time, $T_{\\min}(360)$, we must select the plan that minimizes $m(360, \\text{plan}; 16)$. The stride at each stage is the product of the radices of all preceding stages. To keep this product as small as possible for as many stages as possible, one must order the radices from smallest to largest.\nThe available radices are three $2$s, two $3$s, and one $5$. The optimal plan is $\\langle 2,2,2,3,3,5 \\rangle$.\nLet us calculate $m$ for this plan:\n- Stage 1 (radix 2): stride = $1$\n- Stage 2 (radix 2): stride = $2$\n- Stage 3 (radix 2): stride = $2 \\cdot 2 = 4$\n- Stage 4 (radix 3): stride = $2 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 2 = 8$\n- Stage 5 (radix 3): stride = $2 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 3 = 24 > 16$. Penalty incurred.\n- Stage 6 (radix 5): stride = $2 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 3 = 72 > 16$. Penalty incurred.\nThe minimum number of stages with penalized strides is $m_{\\min}=2$.\n\nNow, we compute $T_{\\min}(360)$ using the fitted parameters and $m_{\\min}=2$:\n$T_{\\min}(360) = 0.02 + 360(3 \\cdot 0.004 + 2 \\cdot 0.006 + 1 \\cdot 0.010) + 360 \\cdot 0.003 \\cdot 2$\n$T_{\\min}(360) = 0.02 + 360(0.012 + 0.012 + 0.010) + 1.08 \\cdot 2$\n$T_{\\min}(360) = 0.02 + 360(0.034) + 2.16$\n$T_{\\min}(360) = 0.02 + 12.24 + 2.16$\n$T_{\\min}(360) = 14.42$.\n\nThe predicted minimum execution time is $14.42$ microseconds.
