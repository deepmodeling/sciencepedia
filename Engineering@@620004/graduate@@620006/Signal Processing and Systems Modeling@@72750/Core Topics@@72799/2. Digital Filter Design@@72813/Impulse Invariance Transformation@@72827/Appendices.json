The derivation must be performed first in the time domain, based on the provided system interconnection, and then confirmed in the frequency domain.\n\nFirst, we validate the problem statement.\nThe givens are:\n1.  A continuous-time linear time-invariant (LTI) system with an absolutely integrable impulse response $h_a(t)$.\n2.

The system interconnection is defined as: an arbitrary discrete-time input $x[n]$ is converted to a continuous-time signal $x_a(t) = \\sum_{n=-\\infty}^{\\infty} x[n]\\, \\delta(t-nT)$. This signal drives the continuous-time system to produce $y_a(t)$. The output of the discrete-time system, $y[n]$, is obtained by sampling the continuous-time output: $y[n]=y_a(nT)$.\n6.

The postulated relationship: $h_d[n]=\\gamma\\, h_a(nT)$.\n\nThe problem is scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and contains no internal contradictions or missing information. All terms are standard in signal processing theory. The question is a formal derivation based on the provided definitions. Thus, the problem is valid.\n\nWe proceed to the solution.\n\n**Time-Domain Derivation**\n\nThe most direct method to find the impulse response $h_d[n]$ of the equivalent discrete-time system is to use a discrete-time impulse as the input and find the corresponding output sequence. Let the input be the unit impulse sequence, $x[n]=\\delta[n]$, where $\\delta[n]=1$ for $n=0$ and $\\delta[n]=0$ for $n \\neq 0$.\n\nAccording to the problem definition, this discrete-time input is used to form the continuous-time signal $x_a(t)$:\n$$\nx_a(t) = \\sum_{k=-\\infty}^{\\infty} x[k]\\, \\delta(t-kT) = \\sum_{k=-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\delta[k]\\, \\delta(t-kT)\n$$\nDue to the properties of the discrete-time impulse $\\delta[k]$, the only non-zero term in the summation is for $k=0$. Thus, the continuous-time input signal becomes:\n$$\nx_a(t) = \\delta[0]\\, \\delta(t-0 \\cdot T) = 1 \\cdot \\delta(t) = \\delta(t)\n$$\nThis signal, a continuous-time Dirac impulse, is the input to the continuous-time LTI system with impulse response $h_a(t)$. The output of this system, $y_a(t)$, is given by the convolution of the input with the impulse response:\n$$\ny_a(t) = x_a(t) * h_a(t) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} x_a(\\tau) h_a(t-\\tau) \\, d\\tau = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\delta(\\tau) h_a(t-\\tau) \\, d\\tau\n$$\nBy the sifting property of the Dirac delta function, this integral evaluates to:\n$$\ny_a(t) = h_a(t-0) = h_a(t)\n$$\nThe problem states that the discrete-time output $y[n]$ is obtained by sampling $y_a(t)$ at integer multiples of the sampling period $T$:\n$$\ny[n] = y_a(nT) = h_a(nT)\n$$\nBy definition, the output of a discrete-time LTI system when the input is the unit impulse sequence $\\delta[n]$ is the system's impulse response, $h_d[n]$. Therefore, we have found that:\n$$\nh_d[n] = h_a(nT)\n$$\nThe problem postulates a relationship of the form $h_d[n]=\\gamma\\, h_a(nT)$. Comparing our derived result with this postulate, we can directly conclude that the scaling constant $\\gamma$ is:\n$$\n\\gamma = 1\n$$\n\n**Frequency-Domain Confirmation**\n\nWe now confirm this result by analyzing the system in the frequency domain. Let's find the frequency response $H_d(\\exp(j\\omega))$ of the discrete-time system.\nThe relationship between the discrete-time input $x[n]$ and the continuous-time input $x_a(t)$ is given. Their Fourier transforms are related. The CTFT of $x_a(t)$ is:\n$$\nX_a(j\\Omega) = \\mathcal{F}\\left\\{\\sum_{n=-\\infty}^{\\infty} x[n]\\, \\delta(t-nT)\\right\\} = \\sum_{n=-\\infty}^{\\infty} x[n]\\, \\mathcal{F}\\{\\delta(t-nT)\\} = \\sum_{n=-\\infty}^{\\infty} x[n]\\, \\exp(-j\\Omega nT)\n$$\nThis expression is the DTFT of $x[n]$, $X_d(\\exp(j\\omega))$, with the substitution $\\omega=\\Omega T$. So, $X_a(j\\Omega) = X_d(\\exp(j\\Omega T))$.\n\nThe output of the continuous-time filter in the frequency domain is $Y_a(j\\Omega) = H_a(j\\Omega) X_a(j\\Omega)$:\n$$\nY_a(j\\Omega) = H_a(j\\Omega) X_d(\\exp(j\\Omega T))\n$$\nThe discrete-time output $y[n]$ is obtained by sampling $y_a(t)$ at $t=nT$. The DTFT of the sampled signal, $Y_d(\\exp(j\\omega))$, is related to the CTFT of the original signal, $Y_a(j\\Omega)$, by the aliasing formula, which is a consequence of the Poisson summation formula:\n$$\nY_d(\\exp(j\\omega)) = \\frac{1}{T} \\sum_{k=-\\infty}^{\\infty} Y_a\\left(j\\left(\\frac{\\omega}{T} - \\frac{2\\pi k}{T}\\right)\\right)\n$$\nSubstituting the expression for $Y_a(j\\Omega)$:\n$$\nY_d(\\exp(j\\omega)) = \\frac{1}{T} \\sum_{k=-\\infty}^{\\infty} H_a\\left(j\\left(\\frac{\\omega}{T} - \\frac{2\\pi k}{T}\\right)\\right) X_d\\left(\\exp\\left(j\\left(\\frac{\\omega}{T} - \\frac{2\\pi k}{T}\\right)T\\right)\\right)\n$$\nThe argument of the exponential in $X_d$ simplifies:\n$$\n\\exp\\left(j\\left(\\frac{\\omega}{T} - \\frac{2\\pi k}{T}\\right)T\\right) = \\exp(j(\\omega - 2\\pi k)) = \\exp(j\\omega)\\exp(-j2\\pi k) = \\exp(j\\omega)\n$$\nsince $k$ is an integer. Thus, the term $X_d(\\exp(j\\omega))$ is independent of the summation index $k$ and can be factored out:\n$$\nY_d(\\exp(j\\omega)) = X_d(\\exp(j\\omega)) \\left[ \\frac{1}{T} \\sum_{k=-\\infty}^{\\infty} H_a\\left(j\\left(\\frac{\\omega}{T} - \\frac{2\\pi k}{T}\\right)\\right) \\right]\n$$\nFor a discrete-time LTI system, we have $Y_d(\\exp(j\\omega)) = H_d(\\exp(j\\omega)) X_d(\\exp(j\\omega))$. By comparing this with the derived expression, we identify the frequency response of the discrete-time system:\n$$\nH_d(\\exp(j\\omega)) = \\frac{1}{T} \\sum_{k=-\\infty}^{\\infty} H_a\\left(j\\left(\\frac{\\omega}{T} - \\frac{2\\pi k}{T}\\right)\\right)\n$$\nTo find the impulse response $h_d[n]$ from this frequency response, we take the inverse DTFT:\n$$\nh_d[n] = \\frac{1}{2\\pi} \\int_{-\\pi}^{\\pi} H_d(\\exp(j\\omega)) \\exp(j\\omega n) \\, d\\omega\n$$\nSubstituting the expression for $H_d(\\exp(j\\omega))$:\n$$\nh_d[n] = \\frac{1}{2\\pi} \\int_{-\\pi}^{\\pi} \\left[ \\frac{1}{T} \\sum_{k=-\\infty}^{\\infty} H_a\\left(j\\left(\\frac{\\omega}{T} - \\frac{2\\pi k}{T}\\right)\\right) \\right] \\exp(j\\omega n) \\, d\\omega\n$$\nExchanging the order of integration and summation:\n$$\nh_d[n] = \\frac{1}{2\\pi T} \\sum_{k=-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\int_{-\\pi}^{\\pi} H_a\\left(j\\left(\\frac{\\omega}{T} - \\frac{2\\pi k}{T}\\right)\\right) \\exp(j\\omega n) \\, d\\omega\n$$\nFor each integral, let's perform a change of variables. Let $\\Omega = \\frac{\\omega}{T} - \\frac{2\\pi k}{T}$. This implies $\\omega = T\\Omega + 2\\pi k$ and $d\\omega = T d\\Omega$. The integration limits for each term change: for $\\omega \\in [-\\pi, \\pi]$, the new limits for $\\Omega$ are $[\\frac{-\\pi}{T} - \\frac{2\\pi k}{T}, \\frac{\\pi}{T} - \\frac{2\\pi k}{T}]$.\nThe integral for a given $k$ becomes:\n$$\n\\int_{\\frac{-\\pi-2\\pi k}{T}}^{\\frac{\\pi-2\\pi k}{T}} H_a(j\\Omega) \\exp(j(T\\Omega + 2\\pi k) n) (T d\\Omega) = T \\int_{\\frac{-\\pi-2\\pi k}{T}}^{\\frac{\\pi-2\\pi k}{T}} H_a(j\\Omega) \\exp(j\\Omega nT) \\exp(j2\\pi kn) d\\Omega\n$$\nSince $k$ and $n$ are integers, $\\exp(j2\\pi kn) = 1$. Substituting this back into the sum for $h_d[n]$:\n$$\nh_d[n] = \\frac{1}{2\\pi T} \\sum_{k=-\\infty}^{\\infty} T \\int_{\\frac{-\\pi-2\\pi k}{T}}^{\\frac{\\pi-2\\pi k}{T}} H_a(j\\Omega) \\exp(j\\Omega nT) d\\Omega\n$$\nThe factors of $T$ cancel. The summation of the integrals over these adjacent intervals covers the entire real line:\n$$\nh_d[n] = \\frac{1}{2\\pi} \\sum_{k=-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\int_{\\frac{-\\pi-2\\pi k}{T}}^{\\frac{\\pi-2\\pi k}{T}} H_a(j\\Omega) \\exp(j\\Omega nT) d\\Omega = \\frac{1}{2\\pi} \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} H_a(j\\Omega) \\exp(j\\Omega nT) d\\Omega\n$$\nThis final integral is the definition of the inverse CTFT of $H_a(j\\Omega)$, evaluated at time $t=nT$. The inverse CTFT corresponding to the given forward transform is $h_a(t) = \\frac{1}{2\\pi}\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} H_a(j\\Omega)\\, \\exp(j\\Omega t)\\, d\\Omega$.\nThus, we find:\n$$\nh_d[n] = h_a(nT)\n$$\nThis frequency-domain analysis confirms the result obtained from the time-domain analysis. Comparing again to the postulate $h_d[n]=\\gamma\\, h_a(nT)$, we confirm that $\\gamma = 1$. It is important to note that this result is a direct consequence of the specific system block diagram defined in the problem.

I will proceed with the solution.\n\n### Step 2: Derivation and Option Analysis\n\nThe relationship between the transfer functions for a strictly proper $H_a(s)$ with distinct poles is derived as follows.\nLet the partial fraction expansion of $H_a(s)$ be:\n$$H_a(s) = \\sum_{k=1}^{N} \\frac{R_k}{s - p_k}$$\nFor a causal and stable filter, $\\text{Re}(p_k)  0$ for all $k$. The impulse response is:\n$$h_a(t) = \\sum_{k=1}^{N} R_k e^{p_k t} u(t)$$\nSampling this response gives the discrete-time impulse response:\n$$h_d[n] = T h_a(nT) = T \\sum_{k=1}^{N} R_k e^{p_k nT} u[n] = T \\sum_{k=1}^{N} R_k (e^{p_k T})^n u[n]$$\nThe Z-transform of $h_d[n]$ is:\n$$H_d(z) = \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} h_d[n] z^{-n} = T \\sum_{k=1}^{N} R_k \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} (e^{p_k T} z^{-1})^n$$\nUsing the geometric series formula, we get:\n$$H_d(z) = T \\sum_{k=1}^{N} \\frac{R_k}{1 - e^{p_k T} z^{-1}} = T \\sum_{k=1}^{N} \\frac{R_k z}{z - e^{p_k T}}$$\nThe poles of $H_a(s)$ at $s=p_k$ are mapped to poles of $H_d(z)$ at $z = e^{p_k T}$. Since $\\text{Re}(p_k)  0$, we have $|e^{p_k T}| = e^{\\text{Re}(p_k)T}  1$, so the stability is preserved.\nThe zeros of $H_d(z)$ are more complex. By combining the terms over a common denominator, we get:\n$$H_d(z) = T \\frac{z \\sum_{k=1}^{N} R_k \\prod_{j \\neq k} (z - e^{p_j T})}{\\prod_{k=1}^{N} (z - e^{p_k T})}$$\nThe zeros of $H_d(z)$ are at $z=0$ and the roots of the polynomial in the numerator. The locations of these zeros depend on the analog poles $p_k$, residues $R_k$, and the sampling period $T$. There is no simple mapping for zeros, and it is a known fact that the minimum-phase property is not always preserved.\n\nNow, we evaluate each option.\n\n**A. For every strictly proper, causal, stable, minimum-phase $H_{a}(s)$ and every $T0$, the impulse-invariant $H_{d}(z)$ is minimum-phase; no counterexample exists.**\nThis statement is incorrect. As will be shown in the analysis of option B, counterexamples do exist where a minimum-phase analog filter results in a non-minimum-phase digital filter via impulse invariance.\n\n**Verdict on A: Incorrect.**\n\n**B. If $H_{a}(s)$ has exactly one real pole at $s=-p$ with $p0$, then for every $T0$ the impulse-invariant $H_{d}(z)$ is minimum-phase. More generally, if $H_{a}(s)$ has exactly two distinct real poles at $s=-p_{1}$ and $s=-p_{2}$ with $p_{1},p_{2}0$ and the residues in the partial fraction expansion of $H_{a}(s)$ are both nonnegative, then for every $T0$ the impulse-invariant $H_{d}(z)$ is minimum-phase. A counterexample when these hypotheses are not satisfied is $H_{a}(s)=\\frac{(s+5)(s+6)}{(s+0.1)(s+0.2)(s+0.3)},\\quad T=1$, for which $H_{a}(s)$ is minimum-phase but the impulse-invariant $H_{d}(z)$ has at least one zero outside the unit circle.**\n\nLet's validate the three parts of this option.\n1.  **One-pole case**: If $H_a(s)$ is strictly proper, stable, and has one pole at $s=-p$ ($p0$), it must be of the form $H_a(s) = \\frac{K}{s+p}$ for some constant $K$. This is an all-pole filter (no finite zeros), so it is minimum-phase. Its impulse response is $h_a(t)=K e^{-pt} u(t)$. The digital transfer function is $H_d(z) = \\frac{TKz}{z - e^{-pT}}$. The only zero is at $z=0$, which is inside the unit disk. Thus, $H_d(z)$ is minimum-phase. This statement is correct.\n\n2.  **Two-pole case with non-negative residues**: Let $H_a(s) = \\frac{R_1}{s+p_1} + \\frac{R_2}{s+p_2}$ with $p_1, p_2  0$, $p_1 \\neq p_2$, and residues $R_1 \\ge 0, R_2 \\ge 0$. The impulse response is $h_a(t) = (R_1 e^{-p_1 t} + R_2 e^{-p_2 t})u(t)$. Since $R_1, R_2 \\ge 0$ and the exponential terms are positive for $t0$, $h_a(t) \\ge 0$ for all $t$. This means $h_d[n] = T h_a(nT) \\ge 0$ for all $n \\ge 0$.\n    The discrete transfer function is $H_d(z) = T(\\frac{R_1 z}{z-e^{-p_1 T}} + \\frac{R_2 z}{z-e^{-p_2 T}})$. Its zeros are $z=0$ and the root of $z(R_1+R_2) - (R_1 e^{-p_2 T} + R_2 e^{-p_1 T}) = 0$. The non-trivial zero is $z_0 = \\frac{R_1 e^{-p_2 T} + R_2 e^{-p_1 T}}{R_1+R_2}$. This is a convex combination of $e^{-p_1 T}$ and $e^{-p_2 T}$. Since $p_1, p_2, T  0$, we have $0  e^{-p_1 T}  1$ and $0  e^{-p_2 T}  1$. A convex combination of two points in the interval $(0, 1)$ must also lie in $(0, 1)$. Thus $0  z_0  1$. All zeros are inside the unit disk, so $H_d(z)$ is minimum-phase. This statement is correct.\n\n3.  **Counterexample**: Consider $H_{a}(s)=\\frac{(s+5)(s+6)}{(s+0.1)(s+0.2)(s+0.3)}$ with $T=1$.\n    - $H_a(s)$ has zeros at $s=-5$ and $s=-6$, which are in the open left half-plane. It is minimum-phase.\n    - Poles are at $s=-0.1, -0.2, -0.3$, so it is stable and strictly proper.\n    - Let's check the residues. Let $H_a(s) = \\frac{R_1}{s+0.1} + \\frac{R_2}{s+0.2} + \\frac{R_3}{s+0.3}$.\n    $R_1 = \\left.\\frac{(s+5)(s+6)}{(s+0.2)(s+0.3)}\\right|_{s=-0.1} = \\frac{(4.9)(5.9)}{(0.1)(0.2)} = 1445.5  0$.\n    $R_2 = \\left.\\frac{(s+5)(s+6)}{(s+0.1)(s+0.3)}\\right|_{s=-0.2} = \\frac{(4.8)(5.8)}{(-0.1)(0.1)} = -2784  0$.\n    $R_3 = \\left.\\frac{(s+5)(s+6)}{(s+0.1)(s+0.2)}\\right|_{s=-0.3} = \\frac{(4.7)(5.7)}{(-0.2)(-0.1)} = 1339.5  0$.\n    The residues are not all non-negative, so the sufficient conditions from part 2 are not met.\n    - Now we check if $H_d(z)$ is non-minimum-phase. The zeros of $H_d(z)$ are $z=0$ and the roots of the polynomial $P(z) = R_1(z-e^{-0.2})(z-e^{-0.3}) + R_2(z-e^{-0.1})(z-e^{-0.3}) + R_3(z-e^{-0.1})(z-e^{-0.2})$.

Therefore, $P(z) \\to +\\infty$ as $z \\to -\\infty$.\n    Since $P(z)  0$ for large negative $z$ and $P(-2)  0$, by the Intermediate Value Theorem, there must be a real root $z_0  -2$. The magnitude of this zero is $|z_0|  2$, which is outside the unit circle. Thus, $H_d(z)$ is non-minimum-phase. The counterexample is valid.\n\nAll parts of this option are correct.\n\n**Verdict on B: Correct.**\n\n**C. If $T$ is sufficiently small so that $T  1/\\max_{k} p_{k}$, then for every strictly proper, causal, stable, minimum-phase $H_{a}(s)$, the impulse-invariant $H_{d}(z)$ is minimum-phase. No counterexample exists for sufficiently small $T$.**\nThe statement that for a sufficiently small sampling period $T$, the minimum-phase property is preserved is indeed correct. As $T \\to 0$, the impulse-invariance mapping of zeros approaches that of the bilinear transform ($z \\approx 1+sT$), which is known to map the left half-plane to the interior of the unit disk. However, this option fails to provide a counterexample as required by the problem statement. It only makes a claim about a situation where counterexamples do *not* exist. Therefore, it does not fully answer the question.\n\n**Verdict on C: Incorrect.** (Fails to provide a counterexample.)\n\n**D. If $H_{a}(s)$ has no repeated poles and all zeros are strictly in the open left half-plane, then for every $T0$ the impulse-invariant $H_{d}(z)$ is minimum-phase. A counterexample exists only when $H_{a}(s)$ has repeated poles; for example, $H_{a}(s)=\\frac{1}{(s+1)^{2}}$ with $T=1$ yields a non-minimum-phase $H_{d}(z)$.**\nThis option makes two claims.\n1.  **Condition**: The counterexample in option B, $H_a(s)=\\frac{(s+5)(s+6)}{(s+0.1)(s+0.2)(s+0.3)}$, has no repeated poles and is minimum-phase, yet for $T=1$ it produces a non-minimum-phase $H_d(z)$. This directly falsifies the first claim.\n2.  **Counterexample**: Let $H_a(s) = \\frac{1}{(s+1)^2}$. This is a minimum-phase filter (all-pole). The impulse response is $h_a(t) = t e^{-t} u(t)$. The discrete impulse response is $h_d[n] = T(nT)e^{-nT}u[n] = nT^2 (e^{-T})^n u[n]$. The Z-transform is $H_d(z) = T^2 \\sum_{n=0}^\\infty n (e^{-T}z^{-1})^n$. Using the identity $\\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} n a^n = \\frac{a}{(1-a)^2}$, with $a=e^{-T}z^{-1}$:\n    $$H_d(z) = T^2 \\frac{e^{-T} z^{-1}}{(1 - e^{-T} z^{-1})^2} = \\frac{T^2 e^{-T} z}{(z - e^{-T})^2}$$\n    The only zero of this function is at $z=0$, which is inside the unit disk. Therefore, $H_d(z)$ is minimum-phase for all $T0$. The provided counterexample is incorrect.\n\nBoth claims in this option are false.\n\n**Verdict on D: Incorrect.**\n\n### Conclusion\n\nOption B is the only one that provides correct sufficient conditions for preserving the minimum-phase property and a valid, verifiable counterexample where the property is not preserved.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2877349"}, {"introduction": "This final practice takes you from theory to computational application by tackling a system identification problem. Given a sampled impulse response, your task is to reverse-engineer the original continuous-time system by estimating its poles [@problem_id:2877423]. This requires implementing a numerical algorithm based on the principles of impulse invariance and confronting the multi-valued nature of the complex logarithm, a crucial step in mapping discrete-time modes back to continuous-time poles.", "problem": "You are given the impulse invariance setting for a continuous-time, linear time-invariant (LTI) rational system with transfer function $H_a(s)$ and impulse response $h_a(t)$. Under uniform sampling with period $T$, the discrete-time impulse response is $h_d[n] = h_a(nT)$ for integer $n \\ge 0$. Assume the continuous-time transfer function $H_a(s)$ is strictly proper with simple poles $\\{p_k\\}_{k=1}^K$ with $\\Re\\{p_k\\}  0$ and residues $\\{R_k\\}_{k=1}^K$, so that the impulse response is a finite sum of exponentials $h_a(t) = \\sum_{k=1}^K R_k e^{p_k t}$. Then $h_d[n] = \\sum_{k=1}^K R_k \\left(e^{p_k T}\\right)^n$. Let $z_k = e^{p_k T}$ denote the discrete-time modes.\n\nFrom the definitions above and the properties of exponentials, the sequence $h_d[n]$ is a finite sum of $K$ complex exponentials, which implies it satisfies a homogeneous linear recurrence with constant coefficients of order $K$ whose characteristic roots are $\\{z_k\\}_{k=1}^K$. This can be exploited to estimate the discrete-time modes $\\{z_k\\}$ from a finite set of samples $\\{h_d[n]\\}_{n=0}^{N-1}$ using a consistent data-driven method such as linear prediction or Prony’s method. Once $\\{z_k\\}$ are estimated, recovering the continuous-time poles requires selecting a logarithm branch because the complex logarithm is multivalued. A physically meaningful and widely used choice consistent with impulse invariance is to select the branch so that the imaginary parts $\\Im\\{p_k\\}$ lie within the open Nyquist band $(-\\pi/T,\\pi/T]$ and the stability constraint $\\Re\\{p_k\\}  0$ holds. The residues $\\{R_k\\}$ can then be obtained by solving a linear system defined by the exponential model for $h_d[n]$.\n\nTask: Develop a complete program that, given measured discrete-time impulse responses $\\{h_d[n]\\}$, the sampling period $T$ in seconds, and the model order $K$, estimates the continuous-time poles $\\{p_k\\}$ and validates them against ground truth using a quantitative criterion. Your program must:\n\n- Implement a robust procedure to estimate the $K$ discrete-time modes $\\{z_k\\}$ from $\\{h_d[n]\\}$ using only the properties above (sum of exponentials implies a linear annihilating filter).\n- Map $\\{z_k\\}$ to continuous-time poles $\\{p_k\\}$ using a branch selection that enforces the imaginary parts in $(-\\pi/T, \\pi/T]$ (angles in radians) and yields $\\Re\\{p_k\\}  0$ when supported by the data.\n- Estimate the residues $\\{R_k\\}$ by least squares from the exponential model implied by the estimated $\\{z_k\\}$.\n- For evaluation, perform an optimal matching between estimated poles and true poles that minimizes the total absolute error in $\\mathbb{C}$, and declare success if the maximum absolute pole error across the matched set is less than or equal to a specified tolerance $\\varepsilon_p$ (in radians per second).\n\nUse the following test suite. For each case, synthesize $h_d[n]$ from the stated ground-truth poles and residues via $h_d[n] = \\sum_{k=1}^K R_k e^{p_k n T}$ for $n \\in \\{0,1,\\dots,N-1\\}$, then apply your estimation procedure.

The final printed output must be exactly one line in the specified list format with booleans.", "solution": "We begin from the fundamental model of a continuous-time, linear time-invariant (LTI) rational system with strictly proper transfer function $H_a(s)$. If $H_a(s)$ has simple poles $\\{p_k\\}_{k=1}^K$ with $\\Re\\{p_k\\}  0$ and residues $\\{R_k\\}_{k=1}^K$, then the impulse response is\n$$\nh_a(t) \\;=\\; \\sum_{k=1}^K R_k e^{p_k t},\n$$\na direct consequence of the partial fraction expansion of rational functions and the linearity and time-invariance of the system. Under impulse invariance sampling with sampling period $T$ (seconds), the discrete-time impulse response is\n$$\nh_d[n] \\;=\\; h_a(nT) \\;=\\; \\sum_{k=1}^K R_k \\left(e^{p_k T}\\right)^n \\;=\\; \\sum_{k=1}^K R_k z_k^n,\n$$\nwhere $z_k = e^{p_k T}$ are the discrete-time modes. This expresses $h_d[n]$ as a finite sum of $K$ complex exponentials. A well-tested fact is that any such sequence obeys a homogeneous linear recurrence of order $K$ with constant coefficients: there exist coefficients $\\{a_\\ell\\}_{\\ell=1}^K$ such that for all $n$ in a valid range,\n$$\nh_d[n + K] + \\sum_{\\ell=1}^K a_\\ell\\, h_d[n + K - \\ell] = 0.\n$$\nThe characteristic polynomial of this recurrence,\n$$\nA(z) = z^K + a_1 z^{K-1} + \\cdots + a_K,\n$$\nhas roots at the discrete-time modes $\\{z_k\\}_{k=1}^K$. This follows from substituting a trial solution $h_d[n] = c z^n$ and obtaining $A(z) = 0$.\n\nPrinciple-based estimation of $\\{z_k\\}$: Given a finite set of measured samples $\\{h_d[n]\\}_{n=0}^{N-1}$ and assuming $N$ is sufficiently larger than $K$, we can form a set of $M = N - K$ linear equations of the recurrence. Denote $y[n] = -h_d[n + K]$ and $X[n, \\ell] = h_d[n + K - (\\ell+1)]$ for $\\ell \\in \\{0,1,\\dots,K-1\\}$ and $n \\in \\{0,1,\\dots,M-1\\}$. The linear system $X a \\approx y$ with $a = [a_1,\\dots,a_K]^\\top$ can be solved in the least-squares sense. Once $a$ is estimated, compute the roots of $A(z)$ to obtain $\\{\\hat{z}_k\\}$.\n\nBranch-consistent recovery of $\\{p_k\\}$: The mapping from $z_k$ to $p_k$ is multi-valued because the complex logarithm is multivalued: for any integer $m$, $\\log(z_k) = \\ln|z_k| + \\mathrm{j}(\\arg(z_k) + 2\\pi m)$ is a valid branch. The physically meaningful branch under impulse invariance assumes that analog frequencies are in the Nyquist band and thus chooses the branch whose imaginary parts lie in $(-\\pi/T,\\pi/T]$. A consistent way to achieve this is:\n- Compute the magnitude $|z_k|$ and principal argument $\\arg(z_k) \\in (-\\pi,\\pi]$.\n- Form $\\hat{p}_k = \\dfrac{\\ln|z_k| + \\mathrm{j}\\,\\arg(z_k)}{T}$, which places $\\Im\\{\\hat{p}_k\\}$ in $(-\\pi/T,\\pi/T]$ due to the principal value of the argument. This delivers the branch selection aligned with the Nyquist band. Because $|z_k| = e^{\\Re\\{p_k\\} T}$, stable continuous-time poles yield $|z_k|  1$ and thus $\\Re\\{\\hat{p}_k\\}  0$ in the absence of noise.\n\nResidue estimation: With $\\{\\hat{z}_k\\}$ in hand, fit residues $\\{\\hat{R}_k\\}$ to the model $h_d[n] \\approx \\sum_{k=1}^K \\hat{R}_k \\hat{z}_k^n$ by solving a linear least-squares problem. Using the Vandermonde-like matrix $V \\in \\mathbb{C}^{N \\times K}$ with entries $V[n,k] = \\hat{z}_k^n$ for $n \\in \\{0,\\dots,N-1\\}$ and $k \\in \\{1,\\dots,K\\}$, solve $V \\hat{R} \\approx h_d$ in the least-squares sense.\n\nMatching and validation: To compare the estimated poles $\\{\\hat{p}_k\\}$ with ground-truth $\\{p_k\\}$, a permutation-invariant comparison is required. Construct the cost matrix $C \\in \\mathbb{R}^{K \\times K}$ with $C_{ij} = |\\hat{p}_j - p_i|$, then solve the linear sum assignment (Hungarian) problem to find the permutation that minimizes the total absolute error. Let $e_{\\max}$ be the maximum absolute error under this optimal pairing. A test case is declared successful if $e_{\\max} \\le \\varepsilon_p$. Here the tolerance is set to $\\varepsilon_p = 1.0 \\times 10^{-1}$ (radians per second), balancing numerical sensitivity and model identifiability.\n\nAlgorithmic and numerical considerations:\n- Data length $N$ must satisfy $N \\ge 2K$ to ensure at least $K$ equations for a $K$-parameter recurrence, and in practice one uses $N \\gg K$ for robustness.\n- The least-squares solution of the annihilating filter coefficients and of the residues should be computed using numerically stable methods (for example, the singular value decomposition) provided by standard linear algebra routines.\n- The principal argument function $\\arg(\\cdot)$ returns values in $(-\\pi,\\pi]$, ensuring the imaginary parts of $\\hat{p}_k$ lie in $(-\\pi/T,\\pi/T]$, consistent with the Nyquist band assumption of impulse invariance. If noise causes small violations of stability (for example, $\\Re\\{\\hat{p}_k\\} > 0$ slightly), the mismatch will typically be minor and can be tolerated within the tolerance.\n- Complex-conjugate pole pairs with conjugate residues generate real $h_d[n]$. The estimator does not need to explicitly enforce conjugacy; it will typically recover approximate conjugate pairs due to the structure of the data.\n\nTest suite construction:\n- Case A uses two real poles with $K = 2$, $T = 0.1$ (seconds), $N = 50$, zero noise, poles $\\{-3.0,\\,-7.0\\}$, residues $\\{2.0,\\,-1.0\\}$. This verifies basic recovery for real exponentials.\n- Case B uses one complex-conjugate pair with $K = 2$, $T = 0.05$ (seconds), $N = 120$, zero noise, poles $\\{-1.0 \\pm 5.0\\,\\mathrm{j}\\}$, residues $\\{1.0 \\mp 0.5\\,\\mathrm{j}\\}$. This verifies branch handling and complex modes.\n- Case C uses a pair near the Nyquist boundary with $K = 2$, $T = 0.05$ (seconds), $N = 200$, zero noise, poles $\\{-0.5 \\pm 60.0\\,\\mathrm{j}\\}$, residues $\\{0.3 \\pm 0.2\\,\\mathrm{j}\\}$. Since $\\pi/T \\approx 62.831853\\ldots$ (radians per second), the imaginary parts lie inside the band, testing sensitivity to near-boundary angles.\n- Case D uses three poles with small additive noise with $K = 3$, $T = 0.02$ (seconds), $N = 200$, $\\sigma = 1.0 \\times 10^{-6}$, poles $\\{-2.0,\\,-0.5 \\pm 20.0\\,\\mathrm{j}\\}$, and residues $\\{1.0,\\,0.6 \\mp 0.2\\,\\mathrm{j}\\}$. This tests multi-mode recovery under slight perturbations.\n\nFinal program behavior: For each case, synthesize $h_d[n]$, estimate $\\{\\hat{z}_k\\}$, map to $\\{\\hat{p}_k\\}$ with branch selection in the Nyquist band, estimate residues $\\{\\hat{R}_k\\}$, perform optimal pole matching with the ground truth, and emit a boolean indicating whether $e_{\\max} \\le \\varepsilon_p$.
