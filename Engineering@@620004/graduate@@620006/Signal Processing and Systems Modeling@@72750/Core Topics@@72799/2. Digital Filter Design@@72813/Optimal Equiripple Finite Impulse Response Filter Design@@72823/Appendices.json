This foundational exercise guides you through the essential process of converting passband ripple ($A_p$) and stopband attenuation ($A_s$) from decibels into their corresponding linear deviation values, $\\delta_p$ and $\\delta_s$, and subsequently determining the correct weight ratio needed to achieve the desired performance balance [@problem_id:2888701]. Mastering this conversion is the first and most critical step in any practical FIR filter design project.", "problem": "A linear-phase optimal equiripple Finite Impulse Response (FIR) lowpass filter is to be designed by weighted minimax (Chebyshev) approximation of the desired magnitude response, which equals unity in the passband and zero in the stopband. The specifications are given in decibels: the passband ripple is at most $A_p = 0.25$ dB, and the minimum stopband attenuation is $A_s = 60$ dB.\n\nStarting from fundamental definitions, proceed as follows:\n- Use the definition of decibels for amplitude ratios, namely that for an amplitude ratio $r$, the level in decibels is $20 \\log_{10}(r)$, to derive the linear passband ripple $\\delta_{p}$ implied by $A_{p}$ by modeling the passband deviation as lying between $1 - \\delta_{p}$ and $1 + \\delta_{p}$.\n- Use the same decibel definition to derive the linear stopband ripple $\\delta_{s}$ implied by $A_{s}$ by modeling the maximum stopband magnitude as $\\delta_{s}$ relative to unity.\n- Using the definition of the weighted minimax criterion for two disjoint bands with constant band-weights, deduce the weight ratio $w_{s}/w_{p}$ required to equalize the maximum weighted errors in the passband and stopband.\n\nCompute the numerical value of $w_{s}/w_{p}$ for the given $A_{p}$ and $A_{s}$, and round your answer to four significant figures.

It represents a standard problem in the field of digital signal processing. We may therefore proceed with a formal solution.\n\nThe problem requires the derivation and computation of the weight ratio $w_s/w_p$ for an optimal equiripple lowpass filter design based on given specifications in decibels. The solution is developed from fundamental principles as specified.\n\nFirst, we determine the linear passband ripple, $\\delta_p$, from the passband ripple specification in decibels, $A_p$. The problem states that the desired magnitude response in the passband is unity, and the actual filter's magnitude response, denoted $|H(\\omega)|$, deviates such that it is bounded between $1 - \\delta_p$ and $1 + \\delta_p$. The decibel level $A_p$ is defined for an amplitude ratio $r$ as $20 \\log_{10}(r)$. For passband ripple, this ratio is taken between the maximum and minimum amplitudes within the passband.\nTherefore, the passband ripple $A_p$ is given by:\n$$ A_p = 20 \\log_{10}\\left(\\frac{1 + \\delta_p}{1 - \\delta_p}\\right) $$\nWe are given $A_p = 0.25 \\, \\text{dB}$.

Let $K = 10^{A_p/20}$.\n$$ K(1 - \\delta_p) = 1 + \\delta_p $$\n$$ K - K\\delta_p = 1 + \\delta_p $$\n$$ K - 1 = \\delta_p (1 + K) $$\n$$ \\delta_p = \\frac{K - 1}{K + 1} = \\frac{10^{A_p/20} - 1}{10^{A_p/20} + 1} $$\n\nNext, we determine the linear stopband ripple, $\\delta_s$, from the minimum stopband attenuation, $A_s$. The desired response in the stopband is zero. The maximum magnitude of the filter in the stopband is denoted by $\\delta_s$. The stopband attenuation $A_s$ is the ratio of the unity reference level in the passband to this maximum stopband level, expressed in decibels.\n$$ A_s = 20 \\log_{10}\\left(\\frac{1}{\\delta_s}\\right) $$\nWe are given $A_s = 60 \\, \\text{dB}$. We solve for $\\delta_s$:\n$$ A_s = -20 \\log_{10}(\\delta_s) $$\n$$ \\frac{A_s}{-20} = \\log_{10}(\\delta_s) $$\nExponentiating both sides with base $10$ yields:\n$$ \\delta_s = 10^{-A_s/20} $$\n\nThe design is based on the weighted minimax criterion, which is the foundation of equiripple filters. The goal is to minimize the maximum weighted approximation error, $|E(\\omega)| = |W(\\omega)[H_d(\\omega) - H(\\omega)]|$, across all specified frequency bands. Here, $H_d(\\omega)$ is the ideal desired response and $W(\\omega)$ is a piecewise-constant weighting function. For an optimal filter, the maximum weighted error is equal in all bands.\nIn the passband, the desired response is $H_d(\\omega) = 1$ and the weighting is $w_p$. The maximum absolute error is $|1 - |H(\\omega)||_{\\max} = \\delta_p$. The maximum weighted error is $w_p \\delta_p$.\nIn the stopband, the desired response is $H_d(\\omega) = 0$ and the weighting is $w_s$. The maximum absolute error is $|0 - |H(\\omega)||_{\\max} = \\delta_s$. The maximum weighted error is $w_s \\delta_s$.\nThe equiripple condition requires these maximum weighted errors to be equal:\n$$ w_p \\delta_p = w_s \\delta_s $$\nFrom this equality, we deduce the required ratio of the stopband weight to the passband weight:\n$$ \\frac{w_s}{w_p} = \\frac{\\delta_p}{\\delta_s} $$\n\nNow, we substitute the expressions for $\\delta_p$ and $\\delta_s$ into this ratio:\n$$ \\frac{w_s}{w_p} = \\frac{1}{10^{-A_s/20}} \\left( \\frac{10^{A_p/20} - 1}{10^{A_p/20} + 1} \\right) $$\nWe are given the numerical values $A_p = 0.25$ and $A_s = 60$.\nFirst, we compute the linear ripples:\nFor the passband:\n$$ \\delta_p = \\frac{10^{0.25/20} - 1}{10^{0.25/20} + 1} = \\frac{10^{0.0125} - 1}{10^{0.0125} + 1} $$\n$10^{0.0125} \\approx 1.02919311$.\n$$ \\delta_p \\approx \\frac{1.02919311 - 1}{1.02919311 + 1} = \\frac{0.02919311}{2.02919311} \\approx 0.01438685 $$\nFor the stopband:\n$$ \\delta_s = 10^{-60/20} = 10^{-3} = 0.001 $$\nFinally, we compute the weight ratio:\n$$ \\frac{w_s}{w_p} = \\frac{\\delta_p}{\\delta_s} \\approx \\frac{0.01438685}{0.001} = 14.38685 $$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures.

It is scientifically grounded in the theory of finite impulse response (FIR) filter design, is free of contradictions or ambiguities, and all terms are standard in the field. I shall proceed to the derivation and analysis.\n\nThe problem asks for an explanation of the empirical order estimation for a linear-phase FIR filter, specifically the formula derived from the windowed-sinc method with Kaiser window calibration, and its relation to the optimal Parks–McClellan (PM) equiripple design.\n\nThe design of a linear-phase FIR filter can be approached by truncating and windowing the ideal impulse response. For a lowpass filter with a cutoff frequency $\\omega_c$, the ideal impulse response is a sinc function:\n$$ h_d[n] = \\frac{\\sin(\\omega_c n)}{\\pi n} $$\nThis response is infinite and non-causal. To create a practical FIR filter of length $N$, we multiply $h_d[n]$ by a finite-length window function $w[n]$ of length $N$. The resulting filter's frequency response $H(e^{j\\omega})$ is the circular convolution of the ideal brick-wall frequency response $H_d(e^{j\\omega})$ and the Discrete-Time Fourier Transform (DTFT) of the window, $W(e^{j\\omega})$.\n\nThis convolution has two primary effects:\n$1$. The sharp discontinuity of the brick-wall filter is smeared, creating a transition band of non-zero width. The width of this transition band, $\\Delta\\omega$, is determined by the width of the mainlobe of $W(e^{j\\omega})$. For a window of length $N$, the mainlobe width is inversely proportional to $N$, i.e., $\\Delta\\omega \\propto \\frac{1}{N}$.\n$2$. The ripples in the passband and stopband are caused by the sidelobes of $W(e^{j\\omega})$. The peak ripple amplitude, $\\delta = \\min(\\delta_p, \\delta_s)$, is determined by the peak sidelobe level of the window's spectrum. The stopband attenuation in decibels, $A$, is related to this ripple by the given definition:\n$$ A = -20\\log_{10}(\\delta) $$\n\nThe Kaiser window is a near-optimal window family that provides a flexible trade-off between mainlobe width and sidelobe level, controlled by a single parameter $\\beta$. Through extensive empirical study, Kaiser established formulas that directly link the filter specifications $(A, \\Delta\\omega)$ to the required filter length $N$. These formulas are:\nFor a given attenuation $A$, the required $\\beta$ is approximately:\n$$ \\beta \\approx \\begin{cases} 0.1102(A - 8.7) & A > 50 \\\\ 0.5842(A - 21)^{0.4} + 0.07886(A - 21) & 21 \\le A \\le 50 \\\\ 0 & A < 21 \\end{cases} $$\nFor a given $\\beta$ (or $A$), the relationship between the filter length $N$ and the transition width $\\Delta\\omega$ is given by:\n$$ N \\approx \\frac{D(\\beta)}{\\Delta\\omega} \\quad \\text{or} \\quad (N-1)\\Delta\\omega \\approx D(\\beta) $$\nwhere $D(\\beta)$ is a factor dependent on $\\beta$. Kaiser found that the quantity $A-8$ is roughly proportional to $(N-1)\\Delta\\omega$. This leads to the celebrated single empirical formula for the filter length $N$:\n$$ N \\approx \\frac{A - 8}{2.285 \\Delta\\omega} $$\nNote that some sources use $7.95$ instead of $8$, and may include a $+1$ term, but the form given is the most common for estimation. This formula provides the necessary filter length for a design using the **Kaiser window method**.\n\nThe Parks–McClellan algorithm, based on the Remez exchange algorithm and the alternation theorem, designs an **optimal** FIR filter in the Chebyshev sense. \"Optimal\" means that for a given filter length $N$, it achieves the minimum possible peak error $\\delta$, or conversely, for given specifications $(\\delta_p, \\delta_s, \\omega_p, \\omega_s)$, it finds the filter with the minimum possible length $N$.\n\nSince the Kaiser window design is suboptimal, the length $N_{Kaiser}$ it requires will be greater than or equal to the length $N_{PM}$ required by the optimal PM algorithm for the same specifications: $N_{Kaiser} \\ge N_{PM}$. Therefore, the Kaiser formula provides an **overestimate** of the required PM filter length. This makes it a very useful and safe starting point for the PM algorithm, which requires an initial guess for the filter order ($N-1$). The overestimate is typically modest, often in the range of $10\\%$ to $20\\%$, because the Kaiser window is a very good approximation to the mathematically optimal discrete prolate spheroidal sequences.\n\nFor multiband filter designs with multiple transition bands (e.g., bandpass or bandstop filters), the design is limited by the most stringent specification. The order estimation formula must use the narrowest transition width, $\\Delta\\omega_{\\min}$, and the highest required attenuation, $A_{\\max} = -20\\log_{10}(\\min(\\delta_i))$, where the minimum is taken over all band ripple specifications. However, this simple estimate has limitations. The PM algorithm allows for weighting errors in different bands, a feature not captured by the window-based formula. Furthermore, if transition bands are close to each other, their spectral characteristics can couple, potentially requiring a higher or lower order than the estimate predicts. This means the estimate is a good first guess but may need iterative refinement.\n\nWith this foundation, let us evaluate the given options.\n\n**A.** The estimate follows by equating the Kaiser window’s mainlobe width to the transition width using $\\,\\Delta\\omega\\approx \\dfrac{2.285\\pi}{N}\\,$ and taking $\\,A=-20\\log_{10}\\!\\big(\\min(\\delta_{p},\\delta_{s})\\big)\\,$. It is an upper bound because equiripple filters always need more taps than windowed designs. For multiband filters, replace $\\,\\Delta\\omega\\,$ by the average of all transition widths to retain accuracy.\n**Incorrect**. The formula $\\Delta\\omega\\approx \\frac{2.285\\pi}{N}$ is incorrect; it is missing the dependency on attenuation $A$. The reasoning that equiripple filters need *more* taps is factually wrong; being optimal, they need *fewer* or equal taps. Using the average transition width for multiband design is also incorrect; the narrowest transition is the limiting factor.\n\n**B.** The estimate is obtained by noting that the transition width scales like $\\,\\Delta\\omega\\propto \\dfrac{1}{N}\\,$ with a Kaiser-calibrated proportionality constant and that the ripple amplitude obeys $\\,A=-20\\log_{10}\\!\\big(\\min(\\delta_{p},\\delta_{s})\\big)\\,$ based on the window’s sidelobe level. This yields an empirical relation of the form $\\,N\\approx \\dfrac{A-8}{2.285\\,\\Delta\\omega}\\,$, which typically overestimates the order needed by the Parks–McClellan equiripple design by between $\\,10\\%\\,$ and $\\,20\\%\\,$ and thus serves as a safe initial guess. For multiband designs, using the smallest transition width across bands and the tightest ripple target provides a conservative start, but the estimate ignores band-weight allocations and coupling between closely spaced transitions, so it can under- or overestimate and may require iterative adjustment.\n**Correct**. This option correctly states the conceptual basis ($\\Delta\\omega \\propto 1/N$, A from sidelobes), provides the correct empirical formula ($N \\approx \\frac{A-8}{2.285\\Delta\\omega}$), accurately characterizes its relationship to the optimal PM design (it is an overestimate, thus a safe initial guess), and correctly describes both the heuristic for multiband designs (use $\\Delta\\omega_{\\min}$ and $A_{\\max}$) and the subtle limitations of this approach (ignoring weights and band coupling).\n\n**C.** The constant $\\,2.285\\,$ derives from the alternation theorem of the Parks–McClellan method, which makes the estimate exact for equiripple filters. Therefore, with $\\,\\Delta\\omega\\,$ chosen as the minimum of all transition widths in a multiband specification, the estimate is exact regardless of band weights.\n**Incorrect**. The constant $2.285$ is from the empirical calibration of the *Kaiser window*, not the *alternation theorem*. The estimate is an approximation for an optimal PM filter, not exact. The claim of exactness regardless of band weights is false, as weights directly influence the final optimal solution.\n\n**D.** The estimate uses the rectangular window mainlobe width $\\,\\Delta\\omega\\approx \\dfrac{4\\pi}{N}\\,$ together with $\\,A=-10\\log_{10}(\\delta_{p}+\\delta_{s})\\,$. It systematically underestimates the Parks–McClellan order and becomes more accurate as the number of bands increases.\n**Incorrect**. The problem specifies a Kaiser window calibration, not a rectangular window. A rectangular window provides a fixed, poor attenuation of approximately $21$ dB and is not a suitable basis for a general estimator. The formula for attenuation is incorrect; it should be $-20\\log_{10}(\\delta)$. An estimate based on a suboptimal window would overestimate, not underestimate, the required optimal order.\n\n**E.** The estimate equates the group-delay dispersion to the passband ripple via Parseval’s theorem to obtain a universal constant in $\\,N\\approx \\dfrac{A}{2.285\\,\\Delta\\omega}\\,$. In multiband scenarios, replacing $\\,\\Delta\\omega\\,$ by the geometric mean of all transition widths yields a conservative estimate.\n**Incorrect**. The physical reasoning provided is nonsensical. Linear-phase FIR filters have constant group delay, so there is no dispersion to equate. Parseval's theorem relates energy and is not used in this context. The formula is missing the crucial \"$-8$\" term. The use of the geometric mean for multiband design is an incorrect heuristic.\n\nTherefore, option B is the only one that is correct in all its scientific claims, formulas, and characterizations.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2888722"}, {"introduction": "Moving beyond initial estimates, a deeper understanding of equiripple design requires appreciating its more subtle behaviors.

The amplitude response $A(\\omega)$ becomes an algebraic polynomial $P(x)$ of degree $L$.\n\nThe specifications for the two filters are transformed as follows:\n-   **LPF**: Passband $[0, \\omega_p] \\rightarrow [\\cos(\\omega_p), 1]$; Stopband $[\\omega_s, \\pi] \\rightarrow [-1, \\cos(\\omega_s)]$.\n-   **HPF**: Stopband $[0, \\omega_s] \\rightarrow [\\cos(\\omega_s), 1]$; Passband $[\\omega_p, \\pi] \\rightarrow [-1, \\cos(\\omega_p)]$.\n\nThe difficulty of the approximation problem, and thus the required polynomial degree $L$ (and filter order $N$), is strongly dependent on the width of the transition region in the $x$ domain. This width is $|\\cos(\\omega_p) - \\cos(\\omega_s)|$.\nUsing the trigonometric identity $\\cos(a) - \\cos(b) = -2\\sin((a+b)/2)\\sin((a-b)/2)$, and defining the center of the transition band as $\\omega_c = (\\omega_p+\\omega_s)/2$, the width becomes:\n$$|\\cos(\\omega_p) - \\cos(\\omega_s)| = 2\\sin(\\omega_c)\\sin(|\\omega_p - \\omega_s|/2) = 2\\sin(\\omega_c)\\sin(\\Delta\\omega/2)$$\nFor a fixed transition width $\\Delta\\omega$, the width of the transition region in the $x$ domain is proportional to $\\sin(\\omega_c)$. A wider transition region in the $x$ domain makes the approximation problem easier, requiring a lower filter order $N$. The function $\\sin(\\omega_c)$ is maximized at $\\omega_c = \\pi/2$.\n\nThis implies that the required filter order depends on the location of the transition band. A filter (LPF or HPF) whose transition band is centered closer to $\\pi/2$ will require a lower order than a filter with the same $\\Delta\\omega$ whose transition band is centered closer to $0$ or $\\pi$. Since the problem does not specify the locations of the bands (i.e., the values of $\\omega_c$), it is not possible to state definitively that LPF or HPF will always require a higher order. For instance, a narrowband LPF (with $\\omega_c$ close to $0$) will require a higher order than a midrange HPF (e.g., with $\\omega_c$ near $\\pi/2 - \\Delta\\omega/2 - \\epsilon$) with the same $\\Delta\\omega$.\n\nThis analysis invalidates any claim that one type of filter *always* requires a strictly higher order than the other. It also invalidates the claim that the orders are *exactly equal* for all specifications, as this is only true if their transition bands are located symmetrically with respect to $\\pi/2$ (i.e., $\\omega_{c,HPF} = \\pi - \\omega_{c,LPF}$), a condition not guaranteed by the problem statement.\n\nThe most accurate general statement is that the orders are determined primarily by the ripple specifications and the transition width $\\Delta\\omega$. Since these are specified to be the same, the filter orders will be very close (\"essentially the same\"). Any differences arise from second-order effects, such as the location of the transition band (as analyzed above) or other subtle behaviors at the band endpoints $\\omega=0$ and $\\omega=\\pi$.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. For identical $\\Delta\\omega$ and identical $\\delta_s/\\delta_p$, the minimum orders are essentially the same for lowpass and highpass; any difference is at most by $1$ tap and is attributable to whether $\\omega=0$ or $\\omega=\\pi$ is realized as an active alternation endpoint, which can shift the extremal count by $1$.**\n-   This statement correctly posits that the orders are \"essentially the same,\" which is consistent with empirical design formulas and first-order theoretical analysis where $N$ is dominated by its inverse relationship with $\\Delta\\omega$.\n-   It attributes small differences to endpoint effects at $\\omega=0$ and $\\omega=\\pi$. This is a valid mechanism for small deviations. For certain band edge configurations, an endpoint might not be an extremum of the error function, which can force an additional extremum to appear elsewhere to satisfy the alternation theorem. This change in the number of required alternations (e.g., from $L+2$ to $L+3$ in a more general context than the problem's simplified premise) can alter the minimum required degree $L$ by $1$, which changes the filter length $N=2L+1$ by $2$. The mention of \"1 tap\" is a minor numerical imprecision, but the physical reason cited is correct.\n-   This option provides the most nuanced and physically sound explanation among the choices.\n-   **Verdict: Correct**\n\n**B. The highpass always requires strictly higher order than the lowpass by a factor proportional to $\\pi/\\Delta\\omega$, because including $\\omega=\\pi$ in the passband imposes an additional constraint that reduces the number of available alternations.**\n-   The claim that highpass *always* requires a higher order is incorrect, as demonstrated by the analysis on transition band location.\n-   The reasoning is flawed. For a Type I FIR filter, the amplitude response $A(\\omega)$ has a derivative $A'(\\omega)$ that is identically zero at $\\omega=0$ and $\\omega=\\pi$ due to its formulation as a cosine series. This is an inherent property, not an \"additional constraint\" that consumes a degree of freedom.\n-   **Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**C. The lowpass always requires strictly higher order than the highpass, because including $\\omega=0$ in the passband forces a flatness condition $A'(\\omega)=0$ at $\\omega=0$ that consumes one degree of freedom and thereby increases the order.**\n-   The claim that lowpass *always* requires a higher order is incorrect.\n-   The reasoning is the same flawed logic as in option B. The condition $A'(0)=0$ is automatically satisfied for any Type I filter and imposes no constraint on the filter coefficients.\n-   **Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**D. The two orders are exactly equal for all specifications with identical $\\Delta\\omega$ and $\\delta_s/\\delta_p$, because the lowpass and highpass problems are related by a trivial frequency reversal symmetry that preserves alternation and endpoint behavior for any linear-phase type.**\n-   This statement is too strong. As shown in the derivation, the orders are only guaranteed to be exactly equal under a specific symmetry condition where the HPF bands are a frequency-reversal of the LPF bands (i.e., centered at $\\pi - \\omega_c$ if the LPF is centered at $\\omega_c$). The problem does not impose this condition, so the orders can differ if the bands are located asymmetrically. Therefore, the claim of equality \"for all specifications\" is false.\n-   **Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**Conclusion**: Option A provides the best characterization. It correctly identifies that the orders are nearly identical and points to a valid physical mechanism (subtleties in the number and location of alternations due to endpoint effects) that can cause small differences.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2888678"}]}
