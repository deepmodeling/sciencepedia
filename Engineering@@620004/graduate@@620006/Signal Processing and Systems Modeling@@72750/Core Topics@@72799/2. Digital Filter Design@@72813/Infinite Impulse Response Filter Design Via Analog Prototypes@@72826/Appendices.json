This practice guides you to connect the characteristic pole locations of Butterworth, Chebyshev Type I, and Bessel filters to a key performance metric: the overshoot in their step response. Understanding this connection is crucial for developing the design intuition needed to select the optimal prototype for a specific application, balancing the need for sharp frequency cutoffs against the requirement for a well-behaved transient response [@problem_id:2877753].", "problem": "An engineer must choose among three analog low-pass infinite impulse response filters realized by classical all-pole prototypes of equal order $N \\ge 3$ and equal $-3\\,\\mathrm{dB}$ corner frequency $\\omega_{c}$: Butterworth, Chebyshev Type I with passband ripple $R_{p}=1\\,\\mathrm{dB}$ (ripple factor $\\epsilon>0$), and Bessel (Thomson).

It is a standard comparison problem in the field of analog filter design, based on established principles of linear systems and control theory. The provided information is self-contained, consistent, and sufficient to arrive at a definitive qualitative ranking. The premises regarding the properties of Butterworth, Chebyshev, and Bessel filters are factually correct textbook knowledge.

No scientific, logical, or structural flaws are detected.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is **valid**. A solution will be derived.\n\n**Derivation of Solution**\nThe percentage overshoot in the step response of a linear time-invariant system is primarily determined by the damping ratio $\\zeta$ of the dominant complex-conjugate pole pair (the pair closest to the imaginary axis). A smaller damping ratio $\\zeta$ implies a larger quality factor $Q = 1/(2\\zeta)$, leading to a more oscillatory response and greater overshoot. The task is to compare the effective damping ratios of the dominant poles for the three filter prototypes, given equal order $N \\ge 3$ and equal $-3\\,\\mathrm{dB}$ frequency $\\omega_c$.\n\n1.  **Chebyshev Type I Filter:** This filter is designed to achieve the sharpest possible frequency roll-off for a given order $N$, at the expense of introducing ripple in the passband. To achieve this steep transition, its poles are strategically placed on an ellipse in the left half-plane. Compared to a Butterworth filter of the same order, the poles of a Chebyshev filter, particularly the dominant pair, are shifted closer to the imaginary axis. This proximity to the imaginary axis corresponds to a smaller damping ratio $\\zeta$ and thus a higher quality factor $Q$. Consequently, the Chebyshev Type I filter will exhibit the most pronounced ringing and the **largest overshoot**.\n\n2.  **Butterworth Filter:** This filter is designed for a maximally flat magnitude response in the passband and a monotonic response overall. Its poles are located on a circle of radius $\\omega_c$ in the left half-plane, equally spaced in angle. This arrangement represents a compromise between frequency selectivity and phase/transient response. The damping of its dominant poles is moderate—less than that of a Bessel filter but significantly more than that of a Chebyshev filter. Therefore, the Butterworth filter will have an overshoot that is **smaller than the Chebyshev filter but larger than the Bessel filter**.\n\n3.  **Bessel (Thomson) Filter:** This filter is optimized for a maximally flat group delay, which is equivalent to the most linear possible phase response in the passband. This design goal is ideal for preserving the waveform of signals. To achieve this property, its poles are positioned far from the imaginary axis, with real parts that are large in magnitude compared to their imaginary parts. This placement results in very large damping ratios $\\zeta$ and, correspondingly, very low quality factors $Q$. The step response of a Bessel filter is therefore very well-behaved, exhibiting minimal or no overshoot. It is the filter with the **smallest overshoot**.\n\nCombining these analyses, the relative ranking of the overshoot magnitudes from largest to smallest is: Chebyshev Type I $>$ Butterworth $>$ Bessel.\n\n**Evaluation of Options**\n\n**A. Chebyshev I > Butterworth > Bessel; because Chebyshev Type I poles are, for given $N$ and $\\omega_{c}$, closer to the imaginary axis and possess larger quality factors than Butterworth, while Bessel poles cluster more toward the negative real axis with lower quality factors, yielding nearly monotonic steps.**\n- **Ranking:** The ranking \"Chebyshev I > Butterworth > Bessel\" is correct.\n- **Justification:** The explanation is entirely correct. It accurately states that Chebyshev Type I poles are closer to the imaginary axis (higher $Q$) than Butterworth poles, leading to more overshoot. It also correctly states that Bessel poles are more distant from the imaginary axis and have lower $Q$, resulting in a nearly monotonic step response (minimal overshoot). This reasoning is precisely in line with the fundamental principles of filter design.\n- **Verdict:** **Correct**.\n\n**B. Butterworth > Chebyshev I > Bessel; because Butterworth poles are on a circle, so they are the least damped, while Chebyshev Type I poles are further left and thus more damped; Bessel remains most damped.**\n- **Ranking:** The ranking \"Butterworth > Chebyshev I > Bessel\" is incorrect.\n- **Justification:** The reasoning is flawed. The statement that \"Chebyshev Type I poles are further left and thus more damped\" than Butterworth poles is the opposite of the truth. To achieve a sharper frequency cutoff, Chebyshev poles are moved *closer* to the imaginary axis, making them *less* damped.\n- **Verdict:** **Incorrect**.\n\n**C. All three have essentially the same overshoot for equal order; overshoot is governed primarily by zeros near the origin and not by pole locations for these all-pole prototypes.**\n- **Ranking:** The claim of equal overshoot is incorrect.\n- **Justification:** The reasoning is fundamentally flawed on two counts. First, the prototypes are explicitly defined as \"all-pole,\" meaning they have no finite zeros, so the claim about zeros is nonsensical. Second, for all-pole systems, the overshoot is almost entirely determined by the pole locations, which differ substantially among these three prototypes, leading to dramatically different transient behaviors.\n- **Verdict:** **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. Bessel > Butterworth > Chebyshev I; because the Bessel emphasis on group delay forces its poles to lie closest to the imaginary axis, increasing ringing relative to Butterworth and Chebyshev Type I.**\n- **Ranking:** The ranking \"Bessel > Butterworth > Chebyshev I\" is the reverse of the correct order.\n- **Justification:** The reasoning is factually incorrect. The design for good group delay (linear phase) requires placing poles *far* from the imaginary axis to achieve high damping, not close to it. Bessel filters are known for their excellent transient response (low overshoot), not for \"increasing ringing.\"\n- **Verdict:** **Incorrect**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2877753"}, {"introduction": "After selecting an analog prototype, the next step is transforming it into the digital domain, a process dominated by two key techniques: impulse invariance and the bilinear transform.

The frequency response of the digital filter, $H_{d}(e^{j\\omega})$, is the Discrete-Time Fourier Transform (DTFT) of $h_{d}[n]$.

An all-pole, strictly proper, stable, causal filter of order $N$ is a well-defined entity, its transfer function having the form $H_a(s) = K / D(s)$, where $D(s)$ is a polynomial of degree $N$ with all roots in the open left-half plane, and $K$ is a constant. The two design methods mentioned are canonical procedures. The question is precise and allows for a definitive, verifiable answer derived from first principles. No flaws from the checklist are present.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. A full solution will be derived.\n\nThe analysis proceeds by examining each design method separately, starting from fundamental definitions. The analog prototype is an all-pole filter of order $N$, so its transfer function is of the form:\n$$H_a(s) = \\frac{K}{\\prod_{k=1}^{N} (s - p_k)}$$\nwhere $K$ is a real constant, and the poles $p_k$ satisfy $\\text{Re}(p_k) < 0$ for all $k \\in \\{1,...,N\\}$, which ensures stability and causality. Being strictly proper implies that the degree of the numerator ($0$) is strictly less than the degree of the denominator ($N$). This means the filter has $N$ zeros at $s = \\infty$.\n\n**Analysis of the Bilinear Transform**\nThe bilinear transform is defined by the substitution:\n$$s = c \\frac{1 - z^{-1}}{1 + z^{-1}} = c \\frac{z - 1}{z + 1}$$\nwhere $c$ is a real, positive constant, typically $c = 2/T$ with $T$ being the sampling period. Applying this substitution to $H_a(s)$ yields the discrete-time transfer function $H(z)$:\n$$H(z) = H_a\\left(c \\frac{z - 1}{z + 1}\\right) = \\frac{K}{\\prod_{k=1}^{N} \\left(c \\frac{z - 1}{z + 1} - p_k\\right)}$$\nTo identify the zeros of $H(z)$, we must simplify this expression into a rational function of $z$. Consider a single term in the denominator product:\n$$c \\frac{z - 1}{z + 1} - p_k = \\frac{c(z - 1) - p_k(z + 1)}{z + 1} = \\frac{(c - p_k)z - (c + p_k)}{z + 1}$$\nSubstituting this back into the expression for $H(z)$:\n$$H(z) = \\frac{K}{\\prod_{k=1}^{N} \\frac{(c - p_k)z - (c + p_k)}{z + 1}} = \\frac{K \\prod_{k=1}^{N} (z + 1)}{\\prod_{k=1}^{N} ((c - p_k)z - (c + p_k))} = \\frac{K (z + 1)^N}{\\prod_{k=1}^{N} ((c - p_k)z - (c + p_k))}$$\nThe numerator of $H(z)$ is $K(z+1)^N$. This shows that $H(z)$ has exactly $N$ zeros, and all of them are located at $z = -1$. This result is structural and does not depend on the specific pole locations $\\{p_k\\}$ or the value of $c$ (and hence $T$), as long as the prototype is all-pole of order $N$.\n\nThe discrete-time frequency $\\omega = \\pi$ corresponds to $z = e^{j\\pi} = -1$. Since $H(z)$ has $N \\geq 1$ zeros at $z=-1$, the value of the transfer function at this point is $H(-1) = 0$. Consequently, the magnitude of the frequency response at $\\omega = \\pi$ is $|H(e^{j\\pi})| = |H(-1)| = 0$.\n\n**Analysis of Impulse Invariance**\nThe impulse invariance method dictates that the discrete-time impulse response, $h[n]$, is a sampled version of the continuous-time impulse response, $h_a(t)$. Let us define $h[n] = h_a(nT)$. (A scaling by $T$ is common but does not affect the location of zeros).\n\nFirst, we find $h_a(t)$ by taking the inverse Laplace transform of $H_a(s)$. Assuming for simplicity that the poles $\\{p_k\\}$ are distinct, we can perform a partial fraction expansion:\n$$H_a(s) = \\sum_{k=1}^{N} \\frac{R_k}{s - p_k}$$\nwhere $R_k$ are the residues. The corresponding impulse response is:\n$$h_a(t) = \\left( \\sum_{k=1}^{N} R_k e^{p_k t} \\right) u(t)$$\nwhere $u(t)$ is the Heaviside step function. Sampling at intervals of $T$ gives:\n$$h[n] = h_a(nT) = \\left( \\sum_{k=1}^{N} R_k e^{p_k nT} \\right) u[n]$$\nThe discrete-time transfer function $H(z)$ is the Z-transform of $h[n]$:\n$$H(z) = \\mathcal{Z}\\{h[n]\\} = \\sum_{k=1}^{N} R_k \\mathcal{Z}\\{ (e^{p_k T})^n u[n] \\} = \\sum_{k=1}^{N} R_k \\frac{1}{1 - e^{p_k T} z^{-1}} = \\sum_{k=1}^{N} \\frac{R_k z}{z - e^{p_k T}}$$\nTo find the zeros of $H(z)$, we combine the terms into a single rational function. Let us factor out the common term $z$:\n$$H(z) = z \\left( \\sum_{k=1}^{N} \\frac{R_k}{z - e^{p_k T}} \\right)$$\nThe summation term, when placed over a common denominator $\\prod_{j=1}^{N} (z - e^{p_j T})$, results in a numerator that is a polynomial in $z$ of degree $N-1$. Let this polynomial be $P_{N-1}(z)$. The full transfer function is:\n$$H(z) = \\frac{z \\cdot P_{N-1}(z)}{\\prod_{k=1}^{N} (z - e^{p_k T})}$$\nThe zeros of $H(z)$ are thus composed of one zero at $z=0$ and the $N-1$ roots of the polynomial $P_{N-1}(z)$. The coefficients of $P_{N-1}(z)$ depend on the residues $R_k$ and poles $p_k$ of the analog filter, as well as the sampling period $T$. In a generic case (i.e., for an arbitrary selection of poles $\\{p_k\\}$), these $N-1$ zeros are not located at $z=0$ or $z=-1$. Thus, there is generically a single zero at $z=0$.\n\nThe gain at $\\omega=\\pi$ is given by $H(z)$ evaluated at $z=-1$:\n$$H(-1) = \\sum_{k=1}^{N} \\frac{R_k (-1)}{-1 - e^{p_k T}} = \\sum_{k=1}^{N} \\frac{R_k}{1 + e^{p_k T}}$$\nSince $\\text{Re}(p_k) < 0$, we have $|e^{p_k T}| = e^{\\text{Re}(p_k) T} < 1$. Thus, $e^{p_k T}$ is never equal to $-1$, and the denominators $1 + e^{p_k T}$ are always non-zero. The sum is a complex-weighted sum of terms that will only equal zero under very specific, non-generic conditions on the residues $R_k$ and poles $p_k$. Therefore, in general, $|H(e^{j\\pi})| = |H(-1)| \\neq 0$. This gain clearly depends on the analog residues $R_k$ and the sampling period $T$.\n\nNow we evaluate each option.\n\nA. For the bilinear-transform-based design of an all-pole $H_{a}(s)$ of order $N$, the discrete-time transfer function has exactly $N$ zeros at $z=-1$, independent of the sampling period $T$, which enforces $|H(e^{j\\pi})|=0$.\nThis statement is a direct consequence of our derivation for the bilinear transform. The numerator is exactly $K(z+1)^N$, establishing $N$ zeros at $z=-1$. This enforces $H(-1)=0$, so the gain at $\\omega=\\pi$ is zero. **Correct**.\n\nB. For the impulse-invariance-based design of an all-pole $H_{a}(s)$, the discrete-time transfer function generically has exactly one zero at $z=0$ and no zeros at $z=-1$; consequently $|H(e^{j\\pi})|$ is generally nonzero and depends on the analog residues and the sampling period $T$.\nThis statement is fully supported by our analysis of the impulse invariance method. The transfer function has the form $z \\cdot P_{N-1}(z) / D_N(z)$, indicating one fixed zero at $z=0$ and $N-1$ other zeros whose locations are parameter-dependent and generically not at $z=0$ or $z=-1$. The gain at $z=-1$ is a sum that is generally non-zero and depends on residues and sampling period. **Correct**.\n\nC. For the impulse-invariance-based design of an all-pole $H_{a}(s)$ of order $N$, there are generically $N$ zeros at $z=0$ because each mapped pole contributes a factor $z$ to the numerator.\nThis reasoning is fallacious. While each term in the partial fraction sum $\\sum \\frac{R_k z}{z - e^{p_k T}}$ has a factor of $z$, when these terms are added together, only a single common factor of $z$ can be taken out from the resulting numerator polynomial. The analysis showed one zero at $z=0$ and $N-1$ other zeros, not $N$ zeros at $z=0$. **Incorrect**.\n\nD. For the bilinear-transform-based design, the analog zeros at $s=\\infty$ map to $z=+1$, so $|H(e^{j\\pi})|$ is generally nonzero.\nThe mapping is $s = c \\frac{z-1}{z+1}$. The point $s=\\infty$ corresponds to the value of $z$ that makes the denominator zero, which is $z+1=0$, or $z=-1$. The point $z=+1$ corresponds to $s=c\\frac{1-1}{1+1}=0$. The premise of the statement is factually wrong. Consequently, the conclusion is also wrong, as established in the analysis for option A. **Incorrect**.\n\nE. If the analog prototype is minimum phase and stable, then impulse invariance always yields $|H(e^{j\\pi})|=0$ because all mapped poles lie strictly inside the unit circle.\nAn all-pole filter has no finite zeros, so the minimum phase condition is trivially satisfied. Stability is given. As shown in the main analysis, the mapped poles $z_k = e^{p_k T}$ indeed lie inside the unit circle, which guarantees the stability of the digital filter. However, this is a non-sequitur for the conclusion that $|H(e^{j\\pi})|=0$. Our formula for $H(-1)$ shows it is generically non-zero. The reasoning is flawed and the conclusion is false. **Incorrect**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{AB}$$", "id": "2877761"}]}
