Consider designing such a filter by windowing the ideal, odd-symmetric impulse response with a Kaiser window. The window parameter is denoted by $\\beta$, and the filter order (one less than the length) is denoted by $N$.

This involves determining the necessary Kaiser window parameter, $\\beta$, and the filter order, $N$, to meet specified performance criteria for passband magnitude ripple, $\\delta$, and transition width, $\\Delta\\omega$.\n\nFirst, we address the derivation of the relationships between the filter specifications $(\\delta, \\Delta\\omega)$ and the design parameters $(\\beta, N)$. The design of a Finite Impulse Response (FIR) filter by the window method involves multiplying an ideal infinite impulse response, $h_d[n]$, with a finite-length window function, $w[n]$. For a Hilbert transformer, the ideal frequency response is $H_d(e^{j\\omega}) = -j \\cdot \\text{sgn}(\\omega)$ for $-\\pi  \\omega  \\pi$. Its corresponding ideal impulse response is non-causal and infinitely long, given by:\n$$\nh_d[n] = \n\\begin{cases}\n\\frac{2}{\\pi n}  \\text{for } n \\text{ odd} \\\\\n0  \\text{for } n \\text{ even}\n\\end{cases}\n$$\nThis response has odd symmetry, i.e., $h_d[-n] = -h_d[n]$.\n\nTo create a causal, linear-phase FIR filter of order $N$ (length $M=N+1$), we truncate and shift this response. The problem specifies a Type-III linear-phase filter, which requires an odd length and odd symmetry. An odd length $M$ implies that the order $N=M-1$ must be an even integer. The odd symmetry condition, $h[n] = -h[N-n]$, is naturally satisfied by windowing a centered version of the odd-symmetric $h_d[n]$ when $N$ is even.\n\nThe performance of the resulting filter is governed by the properties of the window function. The Kaiser window is defined by its length, $M=N+1$, and a parameter, $\\beta$, which controls the trade-off between the main-lobe width and the side-lobe attenuation of its Fourier transform. For FIR filter design, there exist well-established empirical formulas that connect the filter specifications to the Kaiser window parameters.\n\nThe maximum passband ripple, $\\delta$, is primarily determined by the peak side-lobe level of the window's Fourier transform. This is controlled by $\\beta$. The relationship is typically expressed through the required minimum stopband attenuation, $A$, given in decibels by:\n$$ A = -20 \\log_{10}(\\delta) $$\nThe parameter $\\beta$ is then estimated from $A$ using the following empirical formula:\n$$\n\\beta = \n\\begin{cases}\n0.1102(A - 8.7),  A  50 \\\\\n0.5842(A - 21)^{0.4} + 0.07886(A - 21),  21 \\le A \\le 50 \\\\\n0,  A  21\n\\end{cases}\n$$\nThe transition width, $\\Delta\\omega$, is determined by the width of the main lobe of the window's Fourier transform, which is inversely proportional to the filter length $M$. The relationship connecting $N$, $A$, and $\\Delta\\omega$ is given by:\n$$ N \\ge \\frac{A - 8}{2.285 \\Delta\\omega} $$\nThese empirical formulas, though originally derived for low-pass filters, are applicable to the design of Hilbert transformers. The underlying principle is that the convolution of the window's Fourier transform with the discontinuities in the ideal frequency response (at $\\omega=0$ and $\\omega=\\pi$ for a Hilbert transformer) dictates the filter's performance. The ripple is caused by side-lobe leakage, and the transition width is set by the main-lobe width, irrespective of the specific ideal filter type.\n\nNow, we evaluate these expressions for the given specifications: $\\delta = 1.5 \\times 10^{-3}$ and $\\Delta\\omega = 0.08\\pi$.\n\nStep 1: Calculate the required attenuation $A$.\n$$ A = -20 \\log_{10}(1.5 \\times 10^{-3}) $$\n$$ A = -20 (\\log_{10}(1.5) - 3) \\approx -20(0.17609 - 3) = -20(-2.82391) \\approx 56.4782 \\text{ dB} $$\n\nStep 2: Calculate the Kaiser window parameter $\\beta$.\nSince $A \\approx 56.48 \\text{ dB}  50 \\text{ dB}$, we use the first case of the formula for $\\beta$:\n$$ \\beta = 0.1102(A - 8.7) $$\n$$ \\beta = 0.1102(56.4782 - 8.7) = 0.1102(47.7782) \\approx 5.26515764 $$\nRounding to four significant figures as requested, we get $\\beta = 5.265$.\n\nStep 3: Estimate the minimum filter order $N$.\nUsing the formula for $N$ with the calculated value of $A$ and the given $\\Delta\\omega$:\n$$ N \\ge \\frac{A - 8}{2.285 \\Delta\\omega} $$\n$$ N \\ge \\frac{56.4782 - 8}{2.285 \\times 0.08\\pi} = \\frac{48.4782}{0.1828\\pi} \\approx \\frac{48.4782}{0.57428} \\approx 84.417 $$\n\nStep 4: Apply the problem constraints to determine the final value of $N$.\nThe filter order $N$ must be an integer. Furthermore, for a Type-III linear-phase filter, the length $N+1$ must be odd, which implies that the order $N$ must be an even integer. We must therefore choose the smallest even integer that satisfies the condition $N \\ge 84.417$. The integers satisfying this condition are $85, 86, 87, \\dots$. The smallest even integer in this sequence is $86$.\nThus, the required filter order is $N=86$.\n\nThe estimated required parameters for the Kaiser window and the filter order are $\\beta \\approx 5.265$ and $N = 86$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n5.265  86\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "2864565"}, {"introduction": "An ideally designed Hilbert transformer has a purely imaginary frequency response, which is essential for creating a perfect quadrature phase shift.

Even if this sign were corrected, the criterion separates amplitude and phase error, which can be less effective than controlling the complex error directly.\n(iii) **Convexity**: The constraint $||H(e^{j\\omega})| - 1| \\le \\delta$ is not convex. The function $|H(e^{j\\omega})|$ is convex in $h[n]$, but the set of points $x$ satisfying $||x|-1| \\le \\delta$ is not a convex set.

Geometrically, it forces $G(\\omega)$ to lie within a disk of minimum radius centered at $-j$ for all $\\omega \\in \\Omega_p$.

There is no phase-wrapping ambiguity.\n(ii) **Meaningfulness**: For $\\omega  0$, the ideal is $G_d(\\omega) = -j$, so $\\Re\\{G_d(\\omega)\\} = 0$ and $\\Im\\{G_d(\\omega)\\} = -1$. This criterion minimizes the worst-case error in the real and imaginary parts separately. Geometrically, it forces $G(\\omega)$ to lie in a square of minimum side length centered at $-j$. This is a direct and meaningful way to enforce the design goal. The restriction to the positive passband $\\Omega_p^+$ is sufficient due to symmetry: controlling errors for $\\omega  0$ automatically controls them for $\\omega  0$, as shown in the introductory analysis.\n(iii) **Convexity**: The problem is $\\min_{\\mathbf{h}, \\delta} \\delta$ subject to $|\\Re\\{G(\\omega)\\}| \\le \\delta$ and $|\\Im\\{G(\\omega)\\}+1| \\le \\delta$ for all $\\omega \\in \\Omega_p^+$.

Log-magnitude ripple and group-delay deviation**\nThe criterion is to minimize $\\sup_{\\omega \\in \\Omega_p} \\left| \\log |H(e^{j\\omega})| \\right|$ subject to a constraint on the group delay deviation, $\\sup_{\\omega \\in \\Omega_p} \\left| - \\frac{d}{d\\omega}\\angle H(e^{j\\omega}) - D \\right| \\le \\delta$.\n\n(i) **Well-definedness**: The group delay $\\tau_g(\\omega) = - \\frac{d}{d\\omega}\\ \\angle H(e^{j\\omega})$ is defined in terms of the derivative of the unwrapped phase. As with option A, the presence of the phase angle function and its derivative makes the formulation susceptible to wrapping issues and ill-posed for standard numerical optimization.\n(ii) **Meaningfulness**: Constraining the group delay to be near the constant $D$ enforces linear phase, but it does not specify the required phase *offset* of $\\pm \\pi/2$ that characterizes a Hilbert transformer. This criterion is for a general linear-phase filter and is therefore an incomplete specification for a Hilbert transformer.\n(iii) **Convexity**: Neither the log-magnitude function $\\log|H(e^{j\\omega})|$ nor the group delay function $\\tau_g(\\omega)$ are convex or affine functions of the filter coefficients $\\mathbf{h}$. Therefore, this formulation is not a convex optimization problem.\n\nThis option fails on all three properties. **Incorrect**.\n\n**E. Euclidean combination of amplitude and phase deviations**\nThe criterion is to minimize $\\sup_{\\omega \\in \\Omega_p} \\sqrt{ \\left( |H(e^{j\\omega})| - 1 \\right)^2 + \\left( \\angle(e^{j\\omega D} H(e^{j\\omega})) - \\operatorname{sgn}(\\omega)\\pi/2 \\right)^2 }$.\n\n(i) **Well-definedness**: Like options A and D, this criterion uses the ambiguous angle function $\\angle(\\cdot)$ and thus suffers from potential phase-wrapping problems.\n(ii) **Meaningfulness**: This option suffers from the same sign mismatch in the target phase as option A.\n(iii) **Convexity**: This objective function is a composition of non-convex functions (angle, magnitude of magnitude difference) of the filter coefficients $\\mathbf{h}$. The resulting optimization problem is not convex.\n\nThis option fails on all three properties. **Incorrect**.\n\nBased on the rigorous analysis, only options B and C represent well-posed, meaningful, and convexly-formulated criteria for designing a minimax FIR Hilbert transformer.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{BC}$$", "id": "2864574"}]}
