The problem is well-posed and scientifically grounded in the established theory of analog filter design. I will proceed with a solution based on first principles.\n\nThe design specifications for a low-pass filter are given by:\n- The passband edge angular frequency, $\\Omega_p$.\n- The stopband edge angular frequency, $\\Omega_s$.\n- The maximum passband ripple (loss), $A_p$, in decibels ($dB$).\n- The minimum stopband attenuation, $A_s$, in decibels ($dB$).\n\nThe squared magnitude response of a low-pass filter, denoted by $|H(j\\Omega)|^2$, with a nominal passband gain of $1$, must satisfy the following conditions. In the passband, for $0 \\le |\\Omega| \\le \\Omega_p$:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{1 + \\varepsilon^2} \\le |H(j\\Omega)|^2 \\le 1\n$$\nIn the stopband, for $|\\Omega| \\ge \\Omega_s$:\n$$\n|H(j\\Omega)|^2 \\le \\frac{1}{A^2}\n$$\nThe parameters $\\varepsilon$ and $A$ are related to the decibel specifications $A_p$ and $A_s$.\n\nThe passband ripple $A_p$ corresponds to the maximum loss at the passband edge $\\Omega_p$.

The required order $N$ is determined by two key dimensionless parameters: the selectivity factor $k$ and the discrimination factor $k_1$.\n\nThe selectivity factor $k$ is a measure of the transition band steepness:\n$$\nk = \\frac{\\Omega_p}{\\Omega_s}\n$$\nFor a stable low-pass filter, we must have $\\Omega_p  \\Omega_s$, which implies $0  k  1$.\n\nThe discrimination factor $k_1$ relates the passband ripple to the stopband attenuation.

This function can be defined using either the modulus (e.g., $k$) or the parameter $m = k^2$ as its argument. Using modulus notation, the formula is:\n$$\nN \\ge \\frac{K(k) K'(k_1)}{K'(k) K(k_1)}\n$$\nwhere $k' = \\sqrt{1-k^2}$ and $k_1'=\\sqrt{1-k_1^2}$ are the complementary moduli, and $K'(k)$ is the complementary integral, defined as $K(k')$.\n\nMany numerical libraries, including the one used in the provided answer code, expect the parameter $m$ as the argument. In this notation, the formula becomes:\n$$\nN \\ge \\frac{K(k^2) K(1 - k_1^2)}{K(1 - k^2) K(k_1^2)}\n$$\nSince the filter order must be an integer, the minimum order $N$ is the smallest integer that satisfies this inequality. This is found by taking the ceiling of the right-hand side:\n$$\nN = \\left\\lceil \\frac{K(k^2) K(1 - k_1^2)}{K(1 - k^2) K(k_1^2)} \\right\\rceil\n$$\nThe calculation of $K(m)$ is performed using standard numerical routines. The implementation will follow this formula precisely.

The conformal map from the $u$-plane to the $s$-plane via Jacobian elliptic functions places poles on a locus in the left half-plane.

The trend is that the first section(s) near the passband edge have the largest $Q_m$.\n- Dependence on $\\epsilon$: The passband ripple factor $\\epsilon$ sets the equiripple amplitude in the passband. Larger $\\epsilon$ allows more passband variation and drives at least the first few pole pairs closer to the imaginary axis to sharpen selectivity near the passband edge, thereby reducing $\\sigma_m$ and increasing $Q_m = \\sqrt{\\sigma_m^2 + \\omega_m^2}/(2\\sigma_m)$. Thus, for fixed $k$ and $N$, increasing $\\epsilon$ tends to increase $Q_m$, most prominently for small $m$.\n- Dependence on $k$: The elliptic modulus $k$ controls the filter's selectivity.

Hence, increasing $k$ tends to increase the largest $Q_m$ values and accentuate the disparity in Q-factors across the different sections.\n\nThese qualitative trends are consistent with the minimax nature of elliptic rational functions in the magnitude-squared response and with the conformal mapping properties of the Jacobian elliptic functions governing pole-zero placement.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.7684}$$", "id": "2868799"}]}
