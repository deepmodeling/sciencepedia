A solution will be derived from fundamental principles as requested.\n\nThe squared magnitude response of a Chebyshev Type II lowpass filter is characterized by being maximally flat in the passband and equiripple in the stopband. It is defined as:\n$$ |H(j\\Omega)|^2 = \\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{1}{\\epsilon^2 T_n^2(\\Omega_s/\\Omega)}} $$\nwhere $T_n(x)$ is the Chebyshev polynomial of the first kind of order $n$, $\\Omega$ is the frequency variable, $\\Omega_s$ is the stopband edge frequency, and $\\epsilon$ is a parameter that controls the stopband ripple. Note that the argument of the Chebyshev polynomial is $\\Omega_s/\\Omega$.\n\nThe design specifications must be imposed on this response function.\n\nFirst, consider the minimum stopband attenuation, $A_s$. The stopband begins at $\\Omega = \\Omega_s$, and the attenuation for a Type II filter is at its minimum value at this frequency because $|T_n(x)| \\le 1$ for $|x| \\le 1$ and $|T_n(x)|$ grows monotonically for $|x|  1$. The attenuation in decibels is given by $A(\\Omega) = -10\\log_{10}(|H(j\\Omega)|^2)$. At $\\Omega = \\Omega_s$, the argument of the Chebyshev polynomial is $1$. Since $T_n(1) = 1$ for all $n$, the squared magnitude response is:\n$$ |H(j\\Omega_s)|^2 = \\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{1}{\\epsilon^2 T_n^2(1)}} = \\frac{1}{1 + \\epsilon^{-2}} = \\frac{\\epsilon^2}{1 + \\epsilon^2} $$\nThe minimum stopband attenuation $A_s$ is thus related to $\\epsilon$ by:\n$$ A_s = -10\\log_{10}\\left(\\frac{\\epsilon^2}{1+\\epsilon^2}\\right) = 10\\log_{10}\\left(\\frac{1+\\epsilon^2}{\\epsilon^2}\\right) = 10\\log_{10}\\left(1 + \\frac{1}{\\epsilon^2}\\right) $$\nFrom this, we express $1/\\epsilon^2$:\n$$ \\frac{A_s}{10} = \\log_{10}\\left(1 + \\frac{1}{\\epsilon^2}\\right) \\implies 10^{A_s/10} = 1 + \\frac{1}{\\epsilon^2} $$\n$$ \\frac{1}{\\epsilon^2} = 10^{A_s/10} - 1 $$\nWith $A_s = 50\\,\\text{dB}$, we have $1/\\epsilon^2 = 10^{50/10} - 1 = 10^5 - 1$.\n\nSecond, consider the maximum passband loss, $A_p$, which occurs at the passband edge frequency, $\\Omega_p$.\n$$ A_p = -10\\log_{10}(|H(j\\Omega_p)|^2) $$\nSubstituting $\\Omega = \\Omega_p$ into the squared magnitude response equation:\n$$ |H(j\\Omega_p)|^2 = \\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{1}{\\epsilon^2 T_n^2(\\Omega_s/\\Omega_p)}} = 10^{-A_p/10} $$\nWe rearrange this to solve for $T_n^2(\\Omega_s/\\Omega_p)$:\n$$ 1 + \\frac{1}{\\epsilon^2 T_n^2(\\Omega_s/\\Omega_p)} = 10^{A_p/10} $$\n$$ \\frac{1}{\\epsilon^2 T_n^2(\\Omega_s/\\Omega_p)} = 10^{A_p/10} - 1 $$\n$$ T_n^2(\\Omega_s/\\Omega_p) = \\frac{1}{\\epsilon^2(10^{A_p/10} - 1)} $$\nNow, we substitute the previously found expression for $1/\\epsilon^2$:\n$$ T_n^2\\left(\\frac{\\Omega_s}{\\Omega_p}\\right) = (10^{A_s/10} - 1) \\frac{1}{10^{A_p/10} - 1} = \\frac{10^{A_s/10} - 1}{10^{A_p/10} - 1} $$\nLet $x = \\Omega_s/\\Omega_p$.

The zeros of the transfer function $H(s)$ occur at frequencies $\\Omega_z$ where $|H(j\\Omega_z)|^2 = 0$. From the squared magnitude response equation, this corresponds to the condition where the denominator becomes infinite, which happens when $T_n(\\Omega_s/\\Omega) = 0$.\nThe zeros of the Chebyshev polynomial $T_n(x)$ occur at $x_k = \\cos\\left(\\frac{(2k-1)\\pi}{2n}\\right)$ for $k = 1, 2, \\dots, n$.\nThus, the zero frequencies $\\Omega_{z,k}$ satisfy:\n$$ \\frac{\\Omega_s}{\\Omega_{z,k}} = \\cos\\left(\\frac{(2k-1)\\pi}{2n}\\right) $$\nThe problem asks for the normalized zero frequencies $\\Omega_{z,k}/\\Omega_s$.
