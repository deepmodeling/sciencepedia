The derivation must proceed from first principles, specifically the definition of the inverse bilateral Laplace transform, without recourse to standard transform pair tables.\n\nThe given system function is:\n$$\nH(s) = \\frac{2s+3}{(s+1)(s+2)}\n$$\nThe system is specified as causal, which implies two conditions:\n1. The impulse response $h(t)$ is zero for all time $t  0$.\n2. The Region of Convergence (ROC) of $H(s)$ is a right half-plane extending to the right of the rightmost pole.\n\nThe poles of $H(s)$ are the roots of the denominator, which are $s_1 = -1$ and $s_2 = -2$. The rightmost pole is at $s = -1$. Therefore, the ROC for the causal system is $\\mathrm{Re}(s) > -1$.\n\nThe impulse response $h(t)$ is obtained by computing the inverse bilateral Laplace transform of $H(s)$, which is defined by the Bromwich integral:\n$$\nh(t) = \\frac{1}{2\\pi j} \\int_{\\sigma - j\\infty}^{\\sigma + j\\infty} H(s) e^{st} ds\n$$\nwhere the path of integration is a vertical line in the $s$-plane, $s = \\sigma + j\\omega$, located within the ROC. For this problem, the real constant $\\sigma$ must satisfy $\\sigma > -1$.\n\nThe evaluation of this integral is performed by closing the integration contour and applying the residue theorem. The manner in which the contour is closed depends on the sign of the variable $t$.\n\nCase 1: $t  0$.\nFor the integral to converge, we must close the contour in the right half-plane where the real part of $s$ approaches $+\\infty$. This is because the term $e^{st}$ in the integrand decays to zero as $\\mathrm{Re}(s) \\to +\\infty$ when $t  0$. Let us consider a closed contour $C_R$ composed of the vertical line segment from $\\sigma - jR$ to $\\sigma + jR$ and a semicircle arc in the right half-plane, centered at $s=\\sigma$ with radius $R$. As $R \\to \\infty$, the Bromwich integral becomes the integral over the infinite vertical line.\n\nThe integrand is $H(s)e^{st}$. The function $H(s)$ is analytic in the region enclosed by $C_R$, as this region is to the right of the line of integration and thus contains no poles. Consequently, the integrand $H(s)e^{st}$ is analytic within and on the contour $C_R$. By Cauchy's Integral Theorem, the integral over this closed contour is zero:\n$$\n\\oint_{C_R} H(s) e^{st} ds = 0\n$$\nThe integral over the closed contour is the sum of the integral along the vertical line and the integral over the semicircular arc. The system function $H(s)$ is strictly proper, meaning that $|H(s)| \\to 0$ as $|s| \\to \\infty$ at least as fast as $1/|s|$. By Jordan's Lemma, for $t  0$, the integral over the right-hand semicircle vanishes as its radius $R \\to \\infty$.\n$$\n\\lim_{R\\to\\infty} \\int_{\\text{arc}} H(s) e^{st} ds = 0\n$$\nSince the integral over the closed path is zero, it follows that the integral along the infinite vertical line must also be zero.\n$$\nh(t) = \\frac{1}{2\\pi j} \\int_{\\sigma - j\\infty}^{\\sigma + j\\infty} H(s) e^{st} ds = 0 \\quad \\text{for } t  0\n$$\nThis result rigorously confirms the causality condition provided in the problem statement.\n\nCase 2: $t > 0$.\nFor $t > 0$, the term $e^{st}$ decays as $\\mathrm{Re}(s) \\to -\\infty$. Thus, we must close the contour with a semicircular arc in the left half-plane. Let this contour be $C_L$. As the radius $R$ of the arc tends to infinity, this contour $C_L$ (traversed counter-clockwise) encloses both poles of $H(s)$ at $s_1 = -1$ and $s_2 = -2$, because the line of integration $\\mathrm{Re}(s) = \\sigma$ has $\\sigma > -1$.\n\nBy the Residue Theorem, the integral over the closed contour $C_L$ is given by $2\\pi j$ times the sum of the residues of the integrand at the poles enclosed within the contour.\n$$\n\\oint_{C_L} H(s) e^{st} ds = 2\\pi j \\sum_{k} \\text{Res}\\left(H(s) e^{st}, s=s_k\\right)\n$$\nAgain, the integral over the closed contour is the sum of the integral along the vertical line and the integral over the left-hand semicircular arc. For $t > 0$, and since $H(s)$ is strictly proper, Jordan's Lemma ensures that the integral over the left-hand arc vanishes as $R \\to \\infty$.\n$$\n\\lim_{R\\to\\infty} \\int_{\\text{arc}} H(s) e^{st} ds = 0\n$$\nTherefore, the Bromwich integral is equal to the value of the closed-loop integral.\n$$\n\\int_{\\sigma - j\\infty}^{\\sigma + j\\infty} H(s) e^{st} ds = \\oint_{C_L} H(s) e^{st} ds\n$$\nSo, for $t > 0$, the impulse response is:\n$$\nh(t) = \\frac{1}{2\\pi j} \\left( 2\\pi j \\sum_{k} \\text{Res}\\left(H(s) e^{st}, s=s_k\\right) \\right) = \\sum_{k} \\text{Res}\\left(H(s) e^{st}, s=s_k\\right)\n$$\nWe now compute the residues of $F(s) = H(s)e^{st}$ at the simple poles $s_1 = -1$ and $s_2 = -2$.\n\nResidue at $s_1 = -1$:\n$$\n\\text{Res}_1 = \\lim_{s \\to -1} (s - (-1)) H(s) e^{st} = \\lim_{s \\to -1} (s+1) \\frac{2s+3}{(s+1)(s+2)} e^{st}\n$$\n$$\n\\text{Res}_1 = \\lim_{s \\to -1} \\frac{2s+3}{s+2} e^{st} = \\frac{2(-1)+3}{-1+2} e^{-t} = \\frac{1}{1} e^{-t} = e^{-t}\n$$\n\nResidue at $s_2 = -2$:\n$$\n\\text{Res}_2 = \\lim_{s \\to -2} (s - (-2)) H(s) e^{st} = \\lim_{s \\to -2} (s+2) \\frac{2s+3}{(s+1)(s+2)} e^{st}\n$$\n$$\n\\text{Res}_2 = \\lim_{s \\to -2} \\frac{2s+3}{s+1} e^{st} = \\frac{2(-2)+3}{-2+1} e^{-2t} = \\frac{-1}{-1} e^{-2t} = e^{-2t}\n$$\nFor $t > 0$, the impulse response is the sum of these residues:\n$$\nh(t) = \\text{Res}_1 + \\text{Res}_2 = e^{-t} + e^{-2t}\n$$\n\nCombining the results for both cases ($t  0$ and $t > 0$) using the unit step function $u(t)$, which is defined as $u(t)=1$ for $t>0$ and $u(t)=0$ for $t0$, we obtain the complete expression for the impulse response:\n$$\nh(t) = (e^{-t} + e^{-2t}) u(t)\n$$\nThis derivation meticulously follows from the fundamental definition of the inverse Laplace transform and demonstrates how the causality condition and the ROC dictate the structure of the time-domain signal.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{(\\exp(-t) + \\exp(-2t))u(t)}\n$$", "id": "2914300"}, {"introduction": "Moving to the discrete-time domain, the relationship between the system function $H(z)$, its Region of Convergence (ROC), and system properties like causality and stability becomes even more nuanced.

For this series to converge, the variable $z$ must be sufficiently small. The region of convergence must be a disk of the form $|z|  R$. For a rational function, this disk extends from the origin to the pole with the smallest magnitude. In this case, the poles are at $z=2$ and $z=3$, so the smallest pole magnitude is $2$. Therefore, the condition of anticausality restricts the ROC to be $|z|2$.\n\nA Linear Time-Invariant (LTI) system is BIBO stable if and only if its impulse response $h[n]$ is absolutely summable, meaning $\\sum_{n=-\\infty}^{\\infty} |h[n]|  \\infty$. This property is equivalent to the ROC of the system function $H(z)$ including the unit circle, $|z|=1$. The value of the transform on the unit circle is\n$$H(e^{j\\omega}) = \\sum_{n=-\\infty}^{\\infty} h[n] e^{-j\\omega n}.$$\nBy the triangle inequality, its magnitude is bounded:\n$$|H(e^{j\\omega})| = \\left| \\sum_{n=-\\infty}^{\\infty} h[n] e^{-j\\omega n} \\right| \\le \\sum_{n=-\\infty}^{\\infty} |h[n] e^{-j\\omega n}| = \\sum_{n=-\\infty}^{\\infty} |h[n]|.$$\nIf the sum on the right is finite (absolute summability), then the $z$-transform converges for $|z|=1$. Thus, BIBO stability requires the ROC to contain the unit circle.\n\nOf the three possible ROCs, only $|z|2$ contains the unit circle $|z|=1$. Since this is also the only ROC consistent with an anticausal impulse response, the unique valid choice is $|z|2$.\n\nTask 2: Compute the unique impulse response $h[n]$ consistent with the chosen ROC.\n\nWe first perform a partial fraction expansion of $H(z)$. Let $x = z^{-1}$.\n$$H(z) = \\frac{1 - \\frac{1}{2}x}{(1 - 2x)(1 - 3x)} = \\frac{A}{1 - 2x} + \\frac{B}{1 - 3x}.$$\nThe coefficients are found as follows:\n$$A = \\left. \\frac{1 - \\frac{1}{2}x}{1 - 3x} \\right|_{x=1/2} = \\frac{1 - \\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)}{1 - 3\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)} = \\frac{1 - \\frac{1}{4}}{1 - \\frac{3}{2}} = \\frac{\\frac{3}{4}}{-\\frac{1}{2}} = -\\frac{3}{2}.$$\n$$B = \\left. \\frac{1 - \\frac{1}{2}x}{1 - 2x} \\right|_{x=1/3} = \\frac{1 - \\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right)}{1 - 2\\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right)} = \\frac{1 - \\frac{1}{6}}{1 - \\frac{2}{3}} = \\frac{\\frac{5}{6}}{\\frac{1}{3}} = \\frac{5}{2}.$$\nThus, the system function is\n$$H(z) = -\\frac{3}{2} \\frac{1}{1 - 2z^{-1}} + \\frac{5}{2} \\frac{1}{1 - 3z^{-1}}.$$\nWe must find the inverse $z$-transform corresponding to the ROC $|z|2$.

That is, the ROC is of the form $|z| > |p_{max}|$, where $p_{max}$ is the outermost pole of the system.\n\nFor a system to be both causal and BIBO-stable, both conditions must be met simultaneously. This means the ROC must be of the form $|z| > |p_{max}|$ and must also contain the unit circle $|z|=1$. This can only be true if $|p_{max}|  1$. In other words, a rational LTI system is both causal and BIBO-stable if and only if all of its poles lie inside the unit circle.\n\nLet us analyze the poles and zeros of the inverse system $G(z) = \\frac{1-0.9z^{-1}}{1-0.5z^{-1}}$.\nThe poles are the roots of the denominator polynomial:\n$$\n1-0.5z^{-1} = 0 \\implies 1 = 0.5z^{-1} \\implies z = 0.5\n$$\nThe system $G(z)$ has a single pole at $z=0.5$.\nThe zeros are the roots of the numerator polynomial:\n$$\n1-0.9z^{-1} = 0 \\implies 1 = 0.9z^{-1} \\implies z = 0.9\n$$\nThe system $G(z)$ has a single zero at $z=0.9$.\n\nTo check for the existence of a causal, BIBO-stable inverse system, we examine the location of the poles of $G(z)$. The only pole is at $z=0.5$. The magnitude of this pole is $|0.5|=0.5$. Since $0.5  1$, the pole lies strictly inside the unit circle. Therefore, it is possible to specify an ROC for $G(z)$ that makes the system both causal and stable.\n\nThe ROC for a causal system must be $|z| > |p_{max}|$. Here, $|p_{max}|=0.5$, so the ROC for causality is $|z| > 0.5$.\nThis ROC, $|z| > 0.5$, contains the unit circle $|z|=1$, which is the condition for BIBO stability.\nThus, a causal and BIBO-stable inverse system $G(z)$ exists, and its ROC is $|z| > 0.5$. The requirement that the product $G(z)H(z)=1$ holds in a region including the unit circle is also satisfied, as the ROC for a causal and stable $H(z)$ is $|z|>0.9$ and the ROC for a causal and stable $G(z)$ is $|z|>0.5$, so their common ROC is $|z|>0.9$, which includes the unit circle.\n\nFinally, we discuss the implications for deconvolution and sensitivity to noise.\nDeconvolution is the process of recovering an input signal $x[n]$ from a measured output signal $y[n]$, given knowledge of the system $H(z)$. In the $z$-domain, this is achieved by $X(z) = G(z)Y(z)$. Since we have found a causal and stable inverse filter $G(z)$, it is theoretically possible to recover $x[n]$ from $y[n]$ by filtering $y[n]$ with $g[n]$, the impulse response of $G(z)$.\n\nHowever, practical implementation is subject to noise. Let the observed output be $y_{obs}[n] = y[n] + w[n]$, where $w[n]$ is some additive noise. The recovered input will be:\n$$\n\\hat{x}[n] = g[n] * y_{obs}[n] = g[n] * (x[n]*h[n] + w[n]) = (g[n]*h[n])*x[n] + g[n]*w[n] = x[n] + g[n]*w[n]\n$$\nThe error in the reconstruction is the filtered noise, $g[n]*w[n]$. The severity of this error depends on the frequency response of the inverse filter, $G(e^{j\\omega})$. Let us examine it.\n$$\n|G(e^{j\\omega})| = \\left| \\frac{1-0.9e^{-j\\omega}}{1-0.5e^{-j\\omega}} \\right|\n$$\nThe original system $H(z)$ has a pole at $z=0.9$, which is close to the unit circle. This creates a large amplification for frequencies near $\\omega=0$ (DC). Specifically, $|H(e^{j0})| = \\frac{|1-0.5|}{|1-0.9|} = \\frac{0.5}{0.1} = 5$. $H(z)$ acts as a low-pass filter.\nConsequently, its inverse $G(z)$ must perform the opposite operation. It has a zero at $z=0.9$, which creates a deep null near $\\omega=0$. At DC, $|G(e^{j0})| = \\frac{|1-0.9|}{|1-0.5|} = \\frac{0.1}{0.5} = 0.2$. At high frequencies, for example $\\omega=\\pi$, $|G(e^{j\\pi})| = \\frac{|1-0.9(-1)|}{|1-0.5(-1)|} = \\frac{1.9}{1.5} \\approx 1.267$. The inverse filter $G(z)$ acts as a high-pass filter.\n\nThe implication is severe. The original system $H(z)$ strongly attenuates the high-frequency content of the input signal $x[n]$. To recover this content, the inverse filter $G(z)$ must provide significant amplification at high frequencies. If the measurement noise $w[n]$ is broadband (e.g., white noise), its high-frequency components will be greatly amplified by the inverse filter. This amplified noise can easily dominate the restored signal, rendering the deconvolution ineffective. This is a classic example of an ill-conditioned inverse problem. The sensitivity arises because the original system has a pole close to the unit circle, or equivalently, a frequency response that is far from flat. Any attempt to perfectly invert such a system will invariably lead to noise amplification in the frequency bands that the original system attenuated.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\frac{1-0.9z^{-1}}{1-0.5z^{-1}}}\n$$", "id": "2914340"}]}
