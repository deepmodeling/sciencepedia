It is a standard exercise in the analysis of discrete-time systems and is free of any invalidating flaws. We may therefore proceed with a solution.\n\nThe problem asks for the analysis of the discrete-time Fourier transform (DTFT) of the right-sided exponential sequence $x[n]=a^{n} u[n]$, where $a \\in \\mathbb{R}$ and $|a|1$. The unit-step sequence $u[n]$ is defined as $u[n]=1$ for $n \\ge 0$ and $u[n]=0$ for $n  0$. The DTFT is defined as\n$$\nX(\\exp(j\\omega)) = \\sum_{n=-\\infty}^{\\infty} x[n] \\exp(-j\\omega n)\n$$\n\n1) Derivation of the closed-form expression for $X(\\exp(j\\omega))$.\nWe begin by substituting the definition of $x[n]$ into the DTFT formula. The presence of the unit-step sequence $u[n]$ restricts the summation to non-negative values of the index $n$:\n$$\nX(\\exp(j\\omega)) = \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} a^{n} \\exp(-j\\omega n)\n$$\nWe can combine the terms raised to the power of $n$:\n$$\nX(\\exp(j\\omega)) = \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} (a \\exp(-j\\omega))^{n}\n$$\nThis is a geometric series of the form $\\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} r^n$ with the common ratio $r = a \\exp(-j\\omega)$. A standard result from the theory of infinite series states that this series converges to $\\frac{1}{1-r}$ if and only if the magnitude of the common ratio is strictly less than $1$, i.e., $|r|1$. We must verify this condition.\nThe magnitude of the ratio is:\n$$\n|r| = |a \\exp(-j\\omega)| = |a| |\\exp(-j\\omega)|\n$$\nFor any real frequency $\\omega$, Euler's formula gives $\\exp(-j\\omega) = \\cos(-\\omega) + j\\sin(-\\omega) = \\cos(\\omega) - j\\sin(\\omega)$. Its magnitude is $|\\exp(-j\\omega)| = \\sqrt{\\cos^2(\\omega) + (-\\sin(\\omega))^2} = \\sqrt{\\cos^2(\\omega) + \\sin^2(\\omega)} = 1$.\nThus, the condition for convergence becomes $|r| = |a| \\cdot 1 = |a|  1$. This condition is given in the problem statement. Therefore, the series converges for all real $\\omega$, and we can apply the formula for the sum of a convergent geometric series:\n$$\nX(\\exp(j\\omega)) = \\frac{1}{1 - a \\exp(-j\\omega)}\n$$\nThis is the required closed-form expression for the DTFT.\n\n2) Magnitude and Phase.\nTo find the magnitude and phase, we first express the complex denominator in Cartesian form using $\\exp(-j\\omega) = \\cos(\\omega) - j\\sin(\\omega)$:\n$$\nX(\\exp(j\\omega)) = \\frac{1}{1 - a(\\cos(\\omega) - j\\sin(\\omega))} = \\frac{1}{(1 - a\\cos(\\omega)) + j(a\\sin(\\omega))}\n$$\nThe magnitude of a complex number $z = z_r + j z_i$ is $|z| = \\sqrt{z_r^2 + z_i^2}$. The magnitude of $X(\\exp(j\\omega))$ is the reciprocal of the magnitude of its denominator:\n$$\n|X(\\exp(j\\omega))| = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{(1 - a\\cos(\\omega))^2 + (a\\sin(\\omega))^2}}\n$$\nExpanding the terms inside the square root gives:\n$$\n(1 - 2a\\cos(\\omega) + a^2\\cos^2(\\omega)) + a^2\\sin^2(\\omega) = 1 - 2a\\cos(\\omega) + a^2(\\cos^2(\\omega) + \\sin^2(\\omega)) = 1 - 2a\\cos(\\omega) + a^2\n$$\nTherefore, the magnitude is:\n$$\n|X(\\exp(j\\omega))| = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - 2a\\cos(\\omega) + a^2}}\n$$\nThe phase of a complex number $z = z_r + j z_i$ is $\\arg\\{z\\} = \\arctan(z_i/z_r)$. The phase of $X(\\exp(j\\omega))$ is the negative of the phase of its denominator, since the numerator is $1$ (a positive real number with phase $0$):\n$$\n\\arg\\{X(\\exp(j\\omega))\\} = -\\arg\\{(1 - a\\cos(\\omega)) + j(a\\sin(\\omega))\\} = -\\arctan\\left(\\frac{a\\sin(\\omega)}{1-a\\cos(\\omega)}\\right)\n$$\nThe term $1-a\\cos(\\omega)$ is always positive because $|a|1$ implies $|a\\cos(\\omega)| \\le |a|  1$. This ensures the arctangent is well-defined without quadrant ambiguity for the unwrapped phase.\n\nQualitative behavior:\n- Magnitude: The term $-2a\\cos(\\omega)$ in the denominator determines the shape.\n  - If $a  0$, the term is minimized (becomes most negative) when $\\cos(\\omega)=1$, i.e., at $\\omega=0$. This minimizes the denominator and maximizes the magnitude. The spectrum is low-pass, with its peak at $\\omega=0$.\n  - If $a  0$, let $a = -|a|$. The term becomes $+2|a|\\cos(\\omega)$. This term is minimized when $\\cos(\\omega)=-1$, i.e., at $\\omega=\\pi$. This minimizes the denominator and maximizes the magnitude. The spectrum is high-pass, with its peak at $\\omega=\\pi$.\n- Phase: The sign of $a$ in the numerator $a\\sin(\\omega)$ determines the sign of the phase for $\\omega \\in (0, \\pi)$.\n  - If $a  0$, the phase is negative for $\\omega \\in (0, \\pi)$.\n  - If $a  0$, the phase is positive for $\\omega \\in (0, \\pi)$.\n\n3) Maximization of Magnitude.\nTo maximize the magnitude $|X(\\exp(j\\omega))|$, we must minimize the positive function in the denominator, $g(\\omega) = 1 - 2a\\cos(\\omega) + a^2$. We can find the minimum by analyzing the behavior of the term $-2a\\cos(\\omega)$, as the other terms are constant with respect to $\\omega$.\n\n- Case 1: $a  0$. The factor $-2a$ is negative. Thus, to minimize $-2a\\cos(\\omega)$, we must maximize $\\cos(\\omega)$. The maximum value of $\\cos(\\omega)$ is $1$, which occurs at $\\omega = 2k\\pi$ for integer $k$. In the interval $[-\\pi, \\pi)$, this corresponds to $\\omega = 0$.\nThe maximum magnitude is obtained by substituting $\\omega=0$ into the magnitude expression:\n$$\n\\max |X(\\exp(j\\omega))| = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - 2a\\cos(0) + a^2}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - 2a + a^2}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{(1-a)^2}} = \\frac{1}{|1-a|}\n$$\nSince $a  0$ and $|a|1$, we have $0  a  1$, which implies $1-a  0$. Thus, $|1-a|=1-a$. The maximum magnitude is $\\frac{1}{1-a}$.\n\n- Case 2: $a  0$. The factor $-2a$ is positive. Thus, to minimize $-2a\\cos(\\omega)$, we must minimize $\\cos(\\omega)$. The minimum value of $\\cos(\\omega)$ is $-1$, which occurs at $\\omega = (2k+1)\\pi$ for integer $k$. In the interval $[-\\pi, \\pi)$, this corresponds to $\\omega = \\pi$ or $\\omega = -\\pi$. We choose $\\omega = \\pi$.\nThe maximum magnitude is obtained by substituting $\\omega=\\pi$ into the magnitude expression:\n$$\n\\max |X(\\exp(j\\omega))| = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - 2a\\cos(\\pi) + a^2}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - 2a(-1) + a^2}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 + 2a + a^2}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{(1+a)^2}} = \\frac{1}{|1+a|}\n$$\nSince $a  0$ and $|a|1$, we have $-1  a  0$, which implies $1+a  0$. Thus, $|1+a|=1+a$. The maximum magnitude is $\\frac{1}{1+a}$.\n\n- Case 3: $a = 0$. The sequence is $x[n]=\\delta[n]$, the unit impulse. The DTFT is $X(\\exp(j\\omega)) = 1$ for all $\\omega$, so the maximum magnitude is $1$.\n\nWe can combine these results into a single expression. For $a0$, the maximum is $\\frac{1}{1-a} = \\frac{1}{1-|a|}$. For $a0$, the maximum is $\\frac{1}{1+a} = \\frac{1}{1-(-a)} = \\frac{1}{1-|a|}$. For $a=0$, $\\frac{1}{1-|0|} = 1$.\nTherefore, for any $a$ satisfying $|a|1$, the maximum magnitude is given by:\n$$\n\\max_{\\omega \\in \\mathbb{R}} |X(\\exp(j\\omega))| = \\frac{1}{1-|a|}\n$$\nThis is the final expression required.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\frac{1}{1-|a|}}\n$$", "id": "2912118"}, {"introduction": "Once you can analyze a signal's spectrum, the next step is learning to manipulate it.
