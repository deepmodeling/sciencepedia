The existence of two distinct time-domain sequences for a single rational expression of $X(z)$ corresponding to two different, non-overlapping regions of convergence is a classic and definitive feature of the bilateral Z-transform. The provided information is sufficient and consistent to find a unique sequence for each specified ROC.\n3.  **Objective:** The problem is stated using precise, formal mathematical language, devoid of any subjectivity or ambiguity.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. It is a well-defined mathematical problem in the field of signal processing. A solution will be constructed.\n\nThe core of this problem lies in the convergence of the geometric series, which has two distinct forms depending on the magnitude of its ratio. The Z-transform is expressed as a power series in the variable $z^{-1}$. The form of the resulting time-domain sequence $x[n]$ is dictated by the region of convergence (ROC) of this series. The given Z-transform is\n$$\nX(z) = \\frac{1}{1 - 0.6\\,z^{-1}}\n$$\nThis expression is a direct application of the sum of a geometric series. Let the ratio of the series be $r = 0.6\\,z^{-1}$. The sum is $\\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} r^k = \\frac{1}{1-r}$, which converges if and only if $|r|<1$.\n\n**Case A: Causal Sequence, $x_{\\mathrm{c}}[n]$ for ROC $\\{|z|>0.6\\}$**\nThe region of convergence is given by $|z| > 0.6$. This can be rewritten as $\\frac{1}{|z|} < \\frac{1}{0.6}$, or $|z^{-1}| < \\frac{1}{0.6}$. Multiplying by $0.6$ gives $|0.6\\,z^{-1}| < 1$.\nThis condition, $|0.6\\,z^{-1}| < 1$, is precisely the requirement for the convergence of the standard geometric series where the ratio is $r = 0.6\\,z^{-1}$. Therefore, we can directly expand $X(z)$ as a power series in $z^{-1}$:\n$$\nX(z) = \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} (0.6\\,z^{-1})^n = \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} (0.6)^n z^{-n}\n$$\nWe compare this expansion to the definition of the bilateral Z-transform:\n$$\nX(z) = \\sum_{n=-\\infty}^{\\infty} x_{\\mathrm{c}}[n]\\,z^{-n}\n$$\nBy equating the coefficients of $z^{-n}$ for each value of $n$, we find that the sequence $x_{\\mathrm{c}}[n]$ must be:\n-   $x_{\\mathrm{c}}[n] = (0.6)^n$ for $n \\ge 0$\n-   $x_{\\mathrm{c}}[n] = 0$ for $n < 0$\nThis sequence can be expressed compactly using the discrete-time unit step function $u[n]$, which is defined as $u[n]=1$ for $n \\ge 0$ and $u[n]=0$ otherwise. Thus, the sequence for this ROC is:\n$$\nx_{\\mathrm{c}}[n] = (0.6)^n u[n]\n$$\nThis sequence is non-zero only for non-negative time indices $n$. By definition, a sequence $x[n]$ that satisfies $x[n]=0$ for all $n<0$ is a **causal** sequence. The ROC being the exterior of a circle centered at the origin, $|z|>0.6$, is the characteristic ROC for a causal, right-sided sequence.\n\n**Case B: Anti-causal Sequence, $x_{\\mathrm{a}}[n]$ for ROC $\\{|z|<0.6\\}$**\nThe region of convergence is now $|z| < 0.6$. This implies that $|0.6\\,z^{-1}| > 1$. The standard geometric series expansion used in Case A is now divergent. We must manipulate the expression for $X(z)$ to utilize the other form of the geometric series identity, which converges for a ratio with magnitude greater than $1$.\n\nWe rewrite $X(z)$ as follows:\n$$\nX(z) = \\frac{1}{1 - 0.6\\,z^{-1}} = \\frac{1}{-0.6\\,z^{-1}(1 - \\frac{1}{0.6\\,z^{-1}})} = -\\frac{z}{0.6} \\frac{1}{1 - 0.6^{-1}z}\n$$\nThe ROC $|z| < 0.6$ implies $|0.6^{-1}z| < 1$. Let the new ratio be $r' = 0.6^{-1}z$. The condition $|r'|<1$ is satisfied, so we can expand the term $\\frac{1}{1 - r'}$ using the standard geometric series formula:\n$$\nX(z) = -\\frac{z}{0.6} \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} (0.6^{-1}z)^k = - \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} (0.6)^{-1}z \\cdot (0.6^{-1}z)^k = - \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} (0.6)^{-(k+1)} z^{k+1}\n$$\nTo compare this with the Z-transform definition, which is a series in powers of $z^{-1}$, we perform a change of index. Let $n = -(k+1)$.\n-   When $k=0$, $n = -1$.\n-   As $k \\to \\infty$, $n \\to -\\infty$.\n-   The exponent of $z$ is $k+1 = -n$.\n-   The exponent of $0.6$ is $-(k+1) = n$.\nSubstituting these into the summation yields:\n$$\nX(z) = - \\sum_{n=-\\infty}^{-1} (0.6)^n z^{-n} = \\sum_{n=-\\infty}^{-1} \\left( -(0.6)^n \\right) z^{-n}\n$$\nComparing this result to the bilateral Z-transform definition $X(z) = \\sum_{n=-\\infty}^{\\infty} x_{\\mathrm{a}}[n]\\,z^{-n}$, we identify the sequence $x_{\\mathrm{a}}[n]$ by equating coefficients:\n-   $x_{\\mathrm{a}}[n] = -(0.6)^n$ for $n \\le -1$\n-   $x_{\\mathrm{a}}[n] = 0$ for $n \\ge 0$\nTo write this in a compact form, we use the unit step function. The condition $n \\le -1$ is equivalent to $-n-1 \\ge 0$, which corresponds to $u[-n-1]=1$. So, the sequence is:\n$$\nx_{\\mathrm{a}}[n] = -(0.6)^n u[-n-1]\n$$\nThis sequence is non-zero only for negative time indices $n$. A sequence $x[n]$ that satisfies $x[n]=0$ for all $n \\ge 0$ is an **anti-causal** sequence. The ROC being the interior of a circle centered at the origin, $|z|<0.6$, is the characteristic ROC for an anti-causal, left-sided sequence.\n\nIn summary, the specific ROC determines which series expansion is convergent, which in turn dictates the support (the range of non-zero values) of the time-domain sequence. An ROC extending to infinity from a pole corresponds to a causal, right-sided part of the sequence, while an ROC extending inward to zero from a pole corresponds to an anti-causal, left-sided part.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} (0.6)^n u[n] & - (0.6)^n u[-n-1] \\end{pmatrix}}\n$$", "id": "2879332"}, {"introduction": "One of the most direct and intuitive methods for computing the inverse Z-transform of a rational function is long division, which directly generates the power series expansion of $X(z)$.

It requires both direct computation using a standard algorithm and a theoretical analysis of convergence properties, both of which are based on fundamental principles of the $z$-transform.\n\nThe problem asks for two tasks. First, to compute the initial $N=8$ samples of a causal sequence $x[n]$ from its $z$-transform $X(z)$ using the long-division method.

The behavior of the sequence $x[n]$ for large $n$ is determined by the poles of $X(z)$. The poles are the roots of the denominator polynomial set to zero:\n$$1 - 0.5 z^{-1} + 0.25 z^{-2} = 0$$\nMultiplying by $z^2$, we get the characteristic equation:\n$$z^2 - 0.5z + 0.25 = 0$$\nUsing the quadratic formula, the poles $p_1, p_2$ are:\n$$\np_{1,2} = \\frac{0.5 \\pm \\sqrt{(-0.5)^2 - 4(1)(0.25)}}{2} = \\frac{0.5 \\pm \\sqrt{0.25 - 1}}{2} = \\frac{0.5 \\pm \\sqrt{-0.75}}{2} = 0.25 \\pm i \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{4}\n$$\nThese are a complex conjugate pair. The magnitude (radius) of these poles is:\n$$\nr = |p_{1,2}| = \\sqrt{(0.25)^2 + \\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{4}\\right)^2} = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{16} + \\frac{3}{16}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{4}{16}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{4}} = 0.5\n$$\nSince the sequence $x[n]$ is causal, its Region of Convergence (ROC) is the exterior of the circle defined by the outermost pole, i.e., $|z| > 0.5$. The power series $\\sum x[n] z^{-n}$ converges for all $z$ in this region. This is equivalent to convergence for $|z^{-1}| < 1/r = 2$.\n\nThe long-division method generates this power series. Its convergence rate is linked to the pole radius $r$. To formalize this, we express $x[n]$ in its closed form using partial fraction expansion. Let $X(z)$ be written as:\n$$\nX(z) = \\frac{A_1}{1 - p_1 z^{-1}} + \\frac{A_2}{1 - p_2 z^{-1}}\n$$\nThe inverse $z$-transform yields the sequence:\n$$\nx[n] = (A_1 p_1^n + A_2 p_2^n) u[n]\n$$\nFor a general system with $M$ distinct poles $p_k$, the sequence is $x[n] = \\left(\\sum_{k=1}^M A_k p_k^n\\right) u[n]$. The magnitude is bounded by the triangle inequality:\n$$\n|x[n]| = \\left|\\sum_{k=1}^M A_k p_k^n\\right| \\le \\sum_{k=1}^M |A_k| |p_k|^n = \\sum_{k=1}^M |A_k| r_k^n\n$$\nwhere $r_k = |p_k|$. The tail magnitude, which represents the truncation error, is $\\sum_{n=N}^{\\infty} |x[n]|$. A bound on this tail can be found by summing the bound on $|x[n]|$:\n$$\n\\sum_{n=N}^{\\infty} |x[n]| \\le \\sum_{n=N}^{\\infty} \\left(\\sum_{k=1}^M |A_k| r_k^n\\right) = \\sum_{k=1}^M |A_k| \\sum_{n=N}^{\\infty} r_k^n\n$$\nThe inner sum is a geometric series. For $r_k < 1$ (which must be true for a stable system), this converges:\n$$\n\\sum_{n=N}^{\\infty} r_k^n = \\frac{r_k^N}{1 - r_k}\n$$\nThus, we obtain a bound on the tail magnitude:\n$$\n\\sum_{n=N}^{\\infty} |x[n]| \\le \\sum_{k=1}^M |A_k| \\frac{r_k^N}{1 - r_k}\n$$\nThis bound is expressed in terms of the pole radii $r_k$.\n\nTo explain the scaling of this bound as the outermost pole radius $r = \\max_k r_k$ approaches unity from below ($r \\to 1^{-}$), we examine the dominant terms in the bound. For large $N$, the terms with the largest $r_k$ will dominate. Let us assume a single outermost pole (or a complex conjugate pair) at radius $r$. The bound will be strongly influenced by the term $\\frac{r^N}{1-r}$. As $r \\to 1^{-}$, the denominator $(1-r)$ approaches $0$. The residue coefficients $A_k$ also depend on the pole locations, but typically they do not diverge or go to zero in a way that cancels the $(1-r)^{-1}$ term. Therefore, the bound on the tail magnitude scales as:\n$$\n\\text{Tail Magnitude Bound} \\propto \\frac{1}{1-r}\n$$\nThis scaling shows that as poles move closer to the unit circle ($r \\to 1^{-}$), the sequence $x[n]$ decays more slowly, as its envelope $r^n$ stays larger for longer. Consequently, the tail sum $\\sum_{n=N}^{\\infty} |x[n]|$ becomes very large. This implies that the power series converges slowly, and the long-division process becomes computationally inefficient, as a very large number of terms $N$ would be required to achieve a small truncation error. For poles on the unit circle ($r=1$), the system is marginally stable, $x[n]$ does not decay to zero, the tail sum diverges, and the bound correctly becomes infinite. This analysis underscores the crucial relationship between pole locations and system properties like stability and convergence speed.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 1 & \\frac{5}{2} & 1 & -\\frac{1}{8} & -\\frac{5}{16} & -\\frac{1}{8} & \\frac{1}{64} & \\frac{5}{128} \\end{pmatrix}}\n$$", "id": "2879320"}, {"introduction": "Partial Fraction Expansion (PFE) stands as the most powerful and widely used analytical method for inverting rational Z-transforms, providing a closed-form solution for the time-domain signal.

The poles are located at $z_1 = \\frac{3}{10}$, $z_2 = \\frac{9}{10}$, and $z_3 = 2$.\nSince all poles are simple, we can expand $X(z)$ into partial fractions:\n$$\nX(z) = \\frac{A}{1-\\frac{3}{10}z^{-1}} + \\frac{B}{1-\\frac{9}{10}z^{-1}} + \\frac{C}{1-2z^{-1}}\n$$\nThe coefficients $A$, $B$, and $C$ are residues, which can be computed using the following first principles formula for simple poles:\nFor a term $\\frac{K}{1-pz^{-1}}$, the coefficient is $K = \\left. \\left(1-pz^{-1}\\right)X(z) \\right|_{z=p}$.\n\nTo find coefficient $A$, we set $z = z_1 = \\frac{3}{10}$, which is equivalent to $z^{-1} = \\frac{10}{3}$.\n$$\nA = \\left. \\frac{1+\\frac{1}{2}z^{-1}}{\\left(1-\\frac{9}{10}z^{-1}\\right)\\left(1-2z^{-1}\\right)} \\right|_{z^{-1}=\\frac{10}{3}} = \\frac{1+\\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\frac{10}{3}\\right)}{\\left(1-\\frac{9}{10}\\left(\\frac{10}{3}\\right)\\right)\\left(1-2\\left(\\frac{10}{3}\\right)\\right)} = \\frac{1+\\frac{5}{3}}{\\left(1-3\\right)\\left(1-\\frac{20}{3}\\right)} = \\frac{\\frac{8}{3}}{(-2)\\left(-\\frac{17}{3}\\right)} = \\frac{\\frac{8}{3}}{\\frac{34}{3}} = \\frac{8}{34} = \\frac{4}{17}\n$$\nTo find coefficient $B$, we set $z = z_2 = \\frac{9}{10}$, which is equivalent to $z^{-1} = \\frac{10}{9}$.\n$$\nB = \\left. \\frac{1+\\frac{1}{2}z^{-1}}{\\left(1-\\frac{3}{10}z^{-1}\\right)\\left(1-2z^{-1}\\right)} \\right|_{z^{-1}=\\frac{10}{9}} = \\frac{1+\\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\frac{10}{9}\\right)}{\\left(1-\\frac{3}{10}\\left(\\frac{10}{9}\\right)\\right)\\left(1-2\\left(\\frac{10}{9}\\right)\\right)} = \\frac{1+\\frac{5}{9}}{\\left(1-\\frac{1}{3}\\right)\\left(1-\\frac{20}{9}\\right)} = \\frac{\\frac{14}{9}}{\\left(\\frac{2}{3}\\right)\\left(-\\frac{11}{9}\\right)} = \\frac{\\frac{14}{9}}{-\\frac{22}{27}} = -\\frac{14}{9} \\cdot \\frac{27}{22} = -\\frac{14 \\cdot 3}{22} = -\\frac{7 \\cdot 3}{11} = -\\frac{21}{11}\n$$\nTo find coefficient $C$, we set $z = z_3 = 2$, which is equivalent to $z^{-1} = \\frac{1}{2}$.\n$$\nC = \\left. \\frac{1+\\frac{1}{2}z^{-1}}{\\left(1-\\frac{3}{10}z^{-1}\\right)\\left(1-\\frac{9}{10}z^{-1}\\right)} \\right|_{z^{-1}=\\frac{1}{2}} = \\frac{1+\\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)}{\\left(1-\\frac{3}{10}\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)\\right)\\left(1-\\frac{9}{10}\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)\\right)} = \\frac{1+\\frac{1}{4}}{\\left(1-\\frac{3}{20}\\right)\\left(1-\\frac{9}{20}\\right)} = \\frac{\\frac{5}{4}}{\\left(\\frac{17}{20}\\right)\\left(\\frac{11}{20}\\right)} = \\frac{\\frac{5}{4}}{\\frac{187}{400}} = \\frac{5}{4} \\cdot \\frac{400}{187} = \\frac{5 \\cdot 100}{187} = \\frac{500}{187}\n$$\nThus, the partial fraction expansion of $X(z)$ is:\n$$\nX(z) = \\frac{\\frac{4}{17}}{1-\\frac{3}{10}z^{-1}} - \\frac{\\frac{21}{11}}{1-\\frac{9}{10}z^{-1}} + \\frac{\\frac{500}{187}}{1-2z^{-1}}\n$$\nThe next step is to find the inverse $z$-transform of each term. The result depends on the ROC. The bilateral $z$-transform is defined as $X(z) = \\sum_{n=-\\infty}^{\\infty} x[n]z^{-n}$. The convergence of this series defines the ROC. The fundamental transform pairs are derived from the geometric series formula.\nFor a term of the form $\\frac{1}{1-az^{-1}}$, there are two possible inverse transforms:\n1.  A right-sided (causal) sequence: $a^n u[n] \\leftrightarrow \\frac{1}{1-az^{-1}}$, with ROC $|z| > |a|$. This is from the series $\\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} (az^{-1})^n$, which converges when $|az^{-1}|<1$.\n2.  A left-sided (anti-causal) sequence: $-a^n u[-n-1] \\leftrightarrow \\frac{1}{1-az^{-1}}$, with ROC $|z| < |a|$. This is from the series $-\\sum_{n=-\\infty}^{-1} (az^{-1})^n = \\sum_{k=1}^{\\infty} (a^{-1}z)^k$, which converges when $|a^{-1}z|<1$.\n\nWe apply this reasoning to each term, using the given ROC: $\\frac{9}{10} < |z| < 2$.\n\nTerm 1: $\\frac{\\frac{4}{17}}{1-\\frac{3}{10}z^{-1}}$. The pole is at $z = \\frac{3}{10}$. Since the ROC is $|z| > \\frac{9}{10}$, which implies $|z| > \\frac{3}{10}$, this term corresponds to a right-sided sequence.\n$$\n\\mathcal{Z}^{-1}\\left\\{\\frac{\\frac{4}{17}}{1-\\frac{3}{10}z^{-1}}\\right\\} = \\frac{4}{17}\\left(\\frac{3}{10}\\right)^n u[n]\n$$\n\nTerm 2: $-\\frac{\\frac{21}{11}}{1-\\frac{9}{10}z^{-1}}$. The pole is at $z = \\frac{9}{10}$. The ROC is $|z| > \\frac{9}{10}$. This term also corresponds to a right-sided sequence.\n$$\n\\mathcal{Z}^{-1}\\left\\{-\\frac{\\frac{21}{11}}{1-\\frac{9}{10}z^{-1}}\\right\\} = -\\frac{21}{11}\\left(\\frac{9}{10}\\right)^n u[n]\n$$\n\nTerm 3: $\\frac{\\frac{500}{187}}{1-2z^{-1}}$. The pole is at $z=2$. The ROC is $|z| < 2$. This term must correspond to a left-sided sequence.\n$$\n\\mathcal{Z}^{-1}\\left\\{\\frac{\\frac{500}{187}}{1-2z^{-1}}\\right\\} = \\frac{500}{187} \\left(-(2)^n u[-n-1]\\right) = -\\frac{500}{187}(2)^n u[-n-1]\n$$\nBy linearity of the inverse $z$-transform, the total signal $x[n]$ is the sum of these individual components:\n$$\nx[n] = \\frac{4}{17}\\left(\\frac{3}{10}\\right)^n u[n] - \\frac{21}{11}\\left(\\frac{9}{10}\\right)^n u[n] - \\frac{500}{187}(2)^n u[-n-1]\n$$\nThis is the final closed-form expression for the sequence $x[n]$.
