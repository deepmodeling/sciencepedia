It is scientifically grounded in the principles of discrete-time signal processing, well-posed with a unique and meaningful solution, and objective in its formulation. It is a fundamental problem concerning the relationship between the $z$-transform and the Discrete-Time Fourier Transform (DTFT). We will proceed with the derivation as instructed.\n\nThe task is to determine the bilateral $z$-transform and the DTFT of the discrete-time sequence $x[n] = \\delta[n - n_0]$, where $\\delta[\\cdot]$ represents the Kronecker delta function and $n_0$ is an integer. The derivation must begin from the fundamental definitions of the transforms.\n\nFirst, we derive the bilateral $z$-transform, denoted as $X(z)$. The definition of the bilateral $z$-transform of a sequence $x[n]$ is given by the power series:\n$$\nX(z) = \\sum_{n=-\\infty}^{\\infty} x[n] z^{-n}\n$$\nwhere $z$ is a complex variable.\n\nWe substitute the given sequence $x[n] = \\delta[n - n_0]$ into this definition:\n$$\nX(z) = \\sum_{n=-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\delta[n - n_0] z^{-n}\n$$\n\nTo evaluate this summation, we employ the sifting property of the Kronecker delta function. The function $\\delta[n - n_0]$ is equal to $1$ only when its argument is zero, which occurs at $n = n_0$. For all other integer values of $n$, $\\delta[n - n_0]$ is zero. Consequently, the infinite sum collapses to a single term, which is the value of the summand sequence $z^{-n}$ evaluated at the specific index $n = n_0$.\n\nApplying the sifting property, we have:\n$$\nX(z) = z^{-n}|_{n=n_0}\n$$\n\nThis substitution yields the closed-form expression for the $z$-transform:\n$$\nX(z) = z^{-n_0}\n$$\nThe Region of Convergence (ROC) for this transform depends on $n_0$. If $n_0 > 0$, the expression $z^{-n_0}$ is undefined at $z=0$, so the ROC is the entire $z$-plane except for the origin. If $n_0 < 0$, the expression is a positive power of $z$ and is undefined at $z=\\infty$, so the ROC is the entire $z$-plane except for infinity. If $n_0=0$, $X(z)=1$, and the ROC is the entire $z$-plane. In all cases, the ROC includes the unit circle, $|z|=1$, which is a necessary condition for the DTFT to exist.\n\nNext, we are instructed to find the DTFT, $X(\\exp(j\\omega))$, by evaluating the $z$-transform $X(z)$ on the unit circle. The unit circle in the complex $z$-plane is defined by the set of all complex numbers $z$ such that $|z|=1$. These points can be parameterized by the real variable $\\omega$ (frequency in radians) as $z = \\exp(j\\omega)$, where $j = \\sqrt{-1}$.\n\nThe relationship between the DTFT and the $z$-transform is formally expressed as:\n$$\nX(\\exp(j\\omega)) = X(z)|_{z=\\exp(j\\omega)}\n$$\n\nWe substitute $z = \\exp(j\\omega)$ into our derived expression for $X(z) = z^{-n_0}$:\n$$\nX(\\exp(j\\omega)) = \\left( \\exp(j\\omega) \\right)^{-n_0}\n$$\n\nUsing the property of exponents $(a^b)^c = a^{bc}$, we obtain the expression for the DTFT:\n$$\nX(\\exp(j\\omega)) = \\exp(-j\\omega n_0)\n$$\n\nThis completes the derivation as required by the problem statement. The pair of results $(X(z), X(\\exp(j\\omega)))$ represents the transform of the shifted unit sample in the $z$-domain and frequency domain, respectively.

A solution will be formulated.\n\nThe solution proceeds in two parts as requested.\n\n**Part 1: Derivation of the Frequency Response**\n\nThe Discrete-Time Fourier Transform (DTFT) of a discrete-time signal $h[n]$ is defined as:\n$$\nH(\\exp(j\\omega)) = \\sum_{n=-\\infty}^{\\infty} h[n] \\exp(-j\\omega n)\n$$\nThe $z$-transform of the same signal is defined as:\n$$\nH(z) = \\sum_{n=-\\infty}^{\\infty} h[n] z^{-n}\n$$\nA direct comparison of these two definitions reveals that the DTFT is the $z$-transform evaluated on the complex unit circle, where $z = \\exp(j\\omega)$. This is expressed as:\n$$\nH(\\exp(j\\omega)) = H(z)\\Big|_{z=\\exp(j\\omega)}\n$$\nThis evaluation is only valid if the unit circle $|z|=1$ lies within the region of convergence (ROC) of $H(z)$. The problem states the system is causal. For a causal system, the ROC is the region in the complex plane outside the outermost pole. The transfer function $H(z)=\\frac{1- a z^{-1}}{1- b z^{-1}}$ has a single pole at $z=b$. Thus, the ROC is $|z| > |b|$. The problem provides the condition $|b|<1$. Consequently, the ROC $|z|>|b|$ necessarily includes the unit circle $|z|=1$. The existence of the DTFT is therefore guaranteed, and the substitution is valid.\n\nWe are given the transfer function:\n$$\nH(z)=\\frac{1- a z^{-1}}{1- b z^{-1}}\n$$\nTo find the frequency response $H(\\exp(j\\omega))$, we substitute $z = \\exp(j\\omega)$:\n$$\nH(\\exp(j\\omega)) = \\frac{1 - a (\\exp(j\\omega))^{-1}}{1 - b (\\exp(j\\omega))^{-1}}\n$$\nUsing the identity $(\\exp(j\\omega))^{-1} = \\exp(-j\\omega)$, the expression becomes:\n$$\nH(\\exp(j\\omega)) = \\frac{1 - a \\exp(-j\\omega)}{1 - b \\exp(-j\\omega)}\n$$\nThis is the explicit expression for the frequency response of the system.\n\n**Part 2: Characterization of the Unit-Circle Zero**\n\nThe zeros of a system with a rational transfer function $H(z) = \\frac{N(z)}{D(z)}$ are the roots of the numerator polynomial $N(z)$. For the given system, the numerator is:\n$$\nN(z) = 1 - a z^{-1}\n$$\nTo find the zero, we set $N(z)$ to $0$:\n$$\n1 - a z^{-1} = 0\n$$\nAssuming $z \\neq 0$, we can write:\n$$\n1 = a z^{-1} \\implies 1 = \\frac{a}{z}\n$$\nSolving for $z$ gives the location of the zero:\n$$\nz = a\n$$\nThe problem requires this zero to be located on the unit circle. The unit circle in the complex plane is the set of all complex numbers $z$ such that their magnitude is unity, i.e., $|z|=1$.\nApplying this condition to the location of the zero, we must have:\n$$\n|a| = 1\n$$\nAny complex number $a$ satisfying $|a|=1$ can be represented in polar form as $a = r \\exp(j\\vartheta)$, where the modulus $r=|a|=1$ and $\\vartheta$ is the argument or angle. Therefore, the set of all such values for $a$ is given by:\n$$\na = \\exp(j\\vartheta), \\quad \\vartheta \\in \\mathbb{R}\n$$\nHere, $\\vartheta$ is a single real-valued parameter representing the angle in radians.

A complete solution will be provided.\n\n**1) Computation of $x[n]$ via Inverse Z-Transform**\n\nThe inverse Z-transform is given by the contour integral:\n$$\nx[n] = \\frac{1}{2\\pi j} \\oint_{\\mathcal{C}} X(z) z^{n-1} dz\n$$\nwhere $\\mathcal{C}$ is any simple closed contour in the ROC $\\frac{3}{5} < |z| < \\frac{5}{4}$.

Then $x[n] = x_1[n] + x_2[n]$.\n\nThe overall ROC, $\\frac{3}{5} < |z| < \\frac{5}{4}$, is the intersection of the ROCs of the components. The pole of $X_1(z)$ is at $z_1 = \\frac{3}{5}$. The ROC of $X_1(z)$ must be $|z| > \\frac{3}{5}$, corresponding to a right-sided (causal) sequence. The pole of $X_2(z)$ is at $z_2 = \\frac{5}{4}$. The ROC of $X_2(z)$ must be $|z| < \\frac{5}{4}$, corresponding to a left-sided (anti-causal) sequence. We use this physical reasoning to guide the evaluation of the contour integrals.\n\n**Evaluation of $x_1[n]$:**\n$$\nx_1[n] = \\frac{1}{2\\pi j} \\oint_{\\mathcal{C}} \\frac{2z}{z-\\frac{3}{5}} z^{n-1} dz = \\frac{1}{2\\pi j} \\oint_{\\mathcal{C}} \\frac{2z^n}{z-\\frac{3}{5}} dz\n$$\nThe evaluation depends on the value of $n$.\n\nCase $n \\ge 0$: The integrand $f_1(z) = \\frac{2z^n}{z-3/5}$ has a pole at $z=3/5$ (inside $\\mathcal{C}$) and is analytic elsewhere inside $\\mathcal{C}$. To evaluate the integral, we use the Residue Theorem directly. The integral is $2\\pi j$ times the sum of residues inside the contour.\nThe residue of the simple pole is $\\lim_{z \\to 3/5} (z-\\frac{3}{5})\\frac{2z^n}{z-\\frac{3}{5}} = 2(\\frac{3}{5})^n$.\nThus, for $n \\ge 0$, $x_1[n] = 2\\left(\\frac{3}{5}\\right)^n$.\n\nCase $n < 0$: Let $m = -n > 0$. The integrand is $\\frac{2}{z^m(z-\\frac{3}{5})}$. As $|z| \\to \\infty$, the integrand behaves as $\\frac{2}{z^{m+1}}$. The integral over a large circle $\\mathcal{C}_R$ of radius $R$ vanishes as $R \\to \\infty$ since $m+1 \\ge 2$. We can deform $\\mathcal{C}$ to $\\mathcal{C}_R$. The region between $\\mathcal{C}$ and $\\mathcal{C}_R$ does not contain any poles. Thus, $\\oint_{\\mathcal{C}} = \\oint_{\\mathcal{C}_R} \\to 0$ as $R \\to \\infty$.\nThus, for $n < 0$, $x_1[n] = 0$.\nCombining both cases, we find $x_1[n] = 2(\\frac{3}{5})^n u[n]$.\n\n**Evaluation of $x_2[n]$:**\n$$\nx_2[n] = \\frac{1}{2\\pi j} \\oint_{\\mathcal{C}} \\frac{z}{z-\\frac{5}{4}} z^{n-1} dz = \\frac{1}{2\\pi j} \\oint_{\\mathcal{C}} \\frac{z^n}{z-\\frac{5}{4}} dz\n$$\nThe contour $\\mathcal{C}$ is in the ROC and does not encircle the pole at $z_2 = \\frac{5}{4}$.\n\nCase $n < 0$: Let $m = -n > 0$. The integrand is $\\frac{1}{z^m(z-\\frac{5}{4})}$. As $|z| \\to \\infty$, the integrand behaves as $\\frac{1}{z^{m+1}}$, and its integral over a large circle $\\mathcal{C}_R$ vanishes for $m>0$. We deform $\\mathcal{C}$ to a large circle $\\mathcal{C}_R$ with $R > \\frac{5}{4}$. The region between $\\mathcal{C}_R$ and $\\mathcal{C}$ contains the pole at $z=\\frac{5}{4}$. By the residue theorem (noting clockwise traversal of the 'inside' boundary $\\mathcal{C}$):\n$$\n\\oint_{\\mathcal{C}_R} \\frac{z^n}{z-\\frac{5}{4}} dz - \\oint_{\\mathcal{C}} \\frac{z^n}{z-\\frac{5}{4}} dz = 2\\pi j \\cdot \\text{Res}\\left(\\frac{z^n}{z-\\frac{5}{4}}, z=\\frac{5}{4}\\right)\n$$\nAs $R \\to \\infty$, $\\oint_{\\mathcal{C}_R} \\to 0$. The residue of the simple pole is $\\lim_{z \\to 5/4} (z-\\frac{5}{4})\\frac{z^n}{z-\\frac{5}{4}} = (\\frac{5}{4})^n$.\nSo, $- \\oint_{\\mathcal{C}} = 2\\pi j (\\frac{5}{4})^n$.\nThus, for $n < 0$, $x_2[n] = \\frac{1}{2\\pi j} \\oint_{\\mathcal{C}} \\frac{z^n}{z-\\frac{5}{4}} dz = -(\\frac{5}{4})^n$.\n\nCase $n \\ge 0$: The integrand $\\frac{z^n}{z-\\frac{5}{4}}$ is analytic for $|z| < \\frac{5}{4}$. Since the contour $\\mathcal{C}$ is within this region of analyticity, by Cauchy's integral theorem, the integral is zero.\nThus, for $n \\ge 0$, $x_2[n]=0$.\nCombining both cases, we find $x_2[n] = -(\\frac{5}{4})^n u[-n-1]$.\n\n**Total sequence $x[n]$:**\nSumming the components, we obtain the full sequence:\n$$\nx[n] = x_1[n] + x_2[n] = 2\\left(\\frac{3}{5}\\right)^n u[n] - \\left(\\frac{5}{4}\\right)^n u[-n-1]\n$$\n\n**2) Verification using Inverse DTFT**\n\nThe DTFT $X(e^{j\\omega})$ exists because the ROC includes the unit circle. It is obtained by setting $z = e^{j\\omega}$ in $X(z)$. The inverse DTFT is:\n$$\nx[n] = \\frac{1}{2\\pi}\\int_{-\\pi}^{\\pi} X(e^{j\\omega})\\,e^{j\\omega n}\\,d\\omega\n$$\nWe perform a change of variables to evaluate this as a contour integral. Let $z = e^{j\\omega}$. This implies $dz = j e^{j\\omega} d\\omega = jz d\\omega$, so $d\\omega = \\frac{dz}{jz}$. The integration interval $\\omega \\in [-\\pi, \\pi]$ corresponds to a counter-clockwise traversal of the unit circle, $|z|=1$.\nSubstituting these into the inverse DTFT integral:\n$$\nx[n] = \\frac{1}{2\\pi}\\oint_{|z|=1} X(z) z^n \\left(\\frac{dz}{jz}\\right) = \\frac{1}{2\\pi j}\\oint_{|z|=1} X(z) z^{n-1} dz\n$$\nThis is precisely the inverse Z-transform integral, with the contour $\\mathcal{C}$ chosen to be the unit circle $|z|=1$. Since the ROC is $\\frac{3}{5} < |z| < \\frac{5}{4}$, the unit circle is a valid contour.\n\nThe evaluation of this integral proceeds identically to the method in Part 1. The integral is split into two parts:\n$$\nx[n] = \\frac{1}{2\\pi j}\\oint_{|z|=1} \\frac{2z^n}{z-\\frac{3}{5}} dz + \\frac{1}{2\\pi j}\\oint_{|z|=1} \\frac{z^n}{z-\\frac{5}{4}} dz\n$$\n- The first integral corresponds to the pole at $z=\\frac{3}{5}$, which is inside the unit circle. Its evaluation depends on the sign of $n$. For $n \\ge 0$, the integral evaluates to the residue at $z=\\frac{3}{5}$, yielding $2(\\frac{3}{5})^n$. For $n < 0$, it evaluates to $0$. The combined result is $2(\\frac{3}{5})^n u[n]$.\n- The second integral corresponds to the pole at $z=\\frac{5}{4}$, which is outside the unit circle. For $n < 0$, the integral evaluates to the negative of the residue at $z=\\frac{5}{4}$, yielding $-(\\frac{5}{4})^n$. For $n \\ge 0$, it evaluates to $0$. The combined result is $-(\\frac{5}{4})^n u[-n-1]$.\n\nSumming these two results, we recover the same expression for $x[n]$:\n$$\nx[n] = 2\\left(\\frac{3}{5}\\right)^n u[n] - \\left(\\frac{5}{4}\\right)^n u[-n-1]\n$$\nThis verifies the result from Part 1 and demonstrates the fundamental consistency between the Z-transform and the DTFT when the unit circle is within the region of convergence.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{2\\left(\\frac{3}{5}\\right)^n u[n] - \\left(\\frac{5}{4}\\right)^n u[-n-1]}\n$$", "id": "2900345"}]}
