It is well-posed, with sufficient information provided for a unique solution. The language is objective and precise. The premise of asymptotic stability is verifiable: the poles of $H_{0}(s)$ are the roots of the denominator $s^{2}+6s+8=0$, which factors as $(s+2)(s+4)=0$. The poles are at $s=-2$ and $s=-4$. Since both poles lie in the open left-half of the complex plane, the system is indeed asymptotically stable. The problem is free of contradictions, ambiguities, or pseudo-scientific claims.\n\nVerdict: The problem is valid. A solution will be constructed.\n\nThe first objective is to determine the constant $\\alpha$. The input to the system is a unit-step function, denoted $u(t)$, whose Laplace transform is $U(s) = \\frac{1}{s}$. The transfer function of the scaled system is $H(s) = \\alpha H_{0}(s)$. The output of this system, $Y(s)$, is the product of the transfer function and the input transform:\n$$Y(s) = H(s)U(s) = \\alpha H_{0}(s) \\frac{1}{s} = \\alpha \\frac{4(s+1)}{s(s^2+6s+8)}$$\nThe steady-state value of the output, $y_{ss} = \\lim_{t \\to \\infty} y(t)$, can be determined using the Final Value Theorem (FVT) of the Laplace transform. The FVT states that if all poles of $sY(s)$ are in the strict left-half of the complex plane, then $\\lim_{t \\to \\infty} y(t) = \\lim_{s \\to 0} sY(s)$.\nThe function $sY(s)$ is given by:\n$$sY(s) = \\alpha \\frac{4(s+1)}{s^2+6s+8}$$\nThe poles of $sY(s)$ are the roots of $s^2+6s+8=0$, which are $s=-2$ and $s=-4$. Both poles are in the left-half plane, so the FVT is applicable.\nApplying the theorem:\n$$y_{ss} = \\lim_{s \\to 0} sY(s) = \\lim_{s \\to 0} \\alpha \\frac{4(s+1)}{s^2+6s+8}$$\nSubstituting $s=0$ into the expression:\n$$y_{ss} = \\alpha \\frac{4(0+1)}{0^2+6(0)+8} = \\alpha \\frac{4}{8} = \\frac{\\alpha}{2}$$\nThe problem requires this steady-state value to be equal to $1$.\n$$y_{ss} = 1 \\implies \\frac{\\alpha}{2} = 1$$\nSolving for $\\alpha$ yields $\\alpha=2$. This value satisfies the condition $\\alpha>0$.\n\nThe second objective is to find the residues $R_{1}$ and $R_{2}$ for the partial fraction expansion of the normalized transfer function $H(s)$.

Poles and zeros at the origin $z=0$ do not affect this classification.\nFor $H_{\\min}(z) = 1$, there are no poles or zeros other than potentially at the origin or infinity, depending on the interpretation. For a causal finite impulse response (FIR) filter like this, stability is guaranteed and it is conventionally considered minimum-phase as it has no zeros outside the unit circle.\n\nFor $H_{\\text{nm}}(z)$, the pole is determined by the root of the denominator polynomial, $1 - c z^{-1} = 0$, which gives $z=c$. Since $0 < c < 1$, the pole is strictly inside the unit circle, $|c|<1$, which confirms the stability of the causal system. The zero is determined by the root of the numerator polynomial, $z^{-1} - c = 0$, which gives $z = 1/c$. Since $0 < c < 1$, the zero is strictly outside the unit circle, $|1/c| > 1$. The presence of a zero outside the unit circle makes $H_{\\text{nm}}(z)$ a nonminimum-phase system.\n\nNext, we demonstrate that the magnitude responses are identical. The frequency response is obtained by evaluating the transfer function on the unit circle, $z = \\exp(j\\omega)$.\nFor the minimum-phase system:\n$$|H_{\\min}(\\exp(j\\omega))| = |1| = 1$$\nFor the nonminimum-phase system:\n$$H_{\\text{nm}}(\\exp(j\\omega)) = \\frac{\\exp(-j\\omega) - c}{1 - c \\exp(-j\\omega)}$$\nTo find the magnitude, we compute $|H_{\\text{nm}}(\\exp(j\\omega))|$. A direct method is to recognize that the denominator is related to the complex conjugate of the numerator. Let $w = \\exp(-j\\omega) - c$. Since $c$ is real, its complex conjugate is $\\bar{c}=c$, and the conjugate of $\\exp(-j\\omega)$ is $\\exp(j\\omega)$.

Systems with this property are known as all-pass filters.\n\nSecond, we address Task 2 by deriving the difference equations and the unit-step responses.\nFor the minimum-phase system, the input-output relationship in the $z$-domain is $Y_{\\min}(z) = H_{\\min}(z) X(z) = 1 \\cdot X(z) = X(z)$. Applying the inverse $z$-transform yields the difference equation:\n$$y_{\\min}[n] = x[n]$$\nThe input is the unit-step sequence $x[n] = u[n]$, defined as $u[n]=1$ for $n \\ge 0$ and $u[n]=0$ for $n < 0$. The corresponding step response is:\n$$y_{\\min}[n] = u[n]$$\nThe steady-state value as $n \\to \\infty$ is $y_{\\min}[\\infty] = \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} u[n] = 1$.\n\nFor the nonminimum-phase system, the input-output relationship is $Y_{\\text{nm}}(z) = H_{\\text{nm}}(z) X(z)$.\n$$Y_{\\text{nm}}(z) = \\left( \\frac{z^{-1} - c}{1 - c z^{-1}} \\right) X(z)$$\nCross-multiplying gives $Y_{\\text{nm}}(z)(1 - c z^{-1}) = X(z)(z^{-1} - c)$, which expands to $Y_{\\text{nm}}(z) - c z^{-1}Y_{\\text{nm}}(z) = z^{-1}X(z) - cX(z)$.

Consequently, the factor $(1+c)$ is a positive constant greater than $1$. The term $c^n$ is a geometric sequence. Since $0 < c < 1$, this sequence is positive and strictly monotonically decreasing for $n \\ge 0$.\nSpecifically, $c^0=1$, $c^1=c$, $c^2 < c$, and so on. The maximum value of $c^n$ for $n \\ge 0$ occurs at the smallest value of $n$, which is $n=0$.\nTherefore, the maximum of the sequence $D[n]$ also occurs at $n=0$:\n$$\\Delta(c) = \\max_{n \\ge 0} \\left((1+c)c^n\\right) = (1+c)c^0 = 1+c$$\nThis result represents the maximum deviation of the nonminimum-phase response from the final steady-state value, which occurs at time $n=0$ where the response is $y_{\\text{nm}}[0] = 1 - (1+c) = -c$.
