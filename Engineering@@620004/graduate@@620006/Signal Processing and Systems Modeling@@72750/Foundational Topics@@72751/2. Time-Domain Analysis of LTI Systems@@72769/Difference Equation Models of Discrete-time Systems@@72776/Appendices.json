The problem statement is objective and uses precise, unambiguous terminology. All data required for the specified task are provided, and there are no contradictions. The request to use only the LCCDE and initial conditions for a recursive calculation is a standard and valid method for solving such problems. The fact that the initial conditions are non-zero while the input is zero for $$n<0$$ simply means the system was not at rest prior to the application of the impulse, which is a perfectly valid physical scenario.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is deemed **valid**. A solution will be provided.\n\nThe solution requires the direct, recursive application of the given difference equation.

It is a standard problem in the analysis of linear time-invariant (LTI) discrete-time systems and is free of any invalidating flaws. We may proceed with the solution.\n\nThe analysis of a linear, time-invariant, constant-coefficient, homogeneous difference equation begins with the eigenfunction property of LTI systems. For a discrete-time LTI system, an exponential sequence of the form $z^n$ is an eigenfunction, meaning the system's response to this input is the same sequence scaled by a complex constant, the eigenvalue, which is a function of $z$. The homogeneous solution represents the natural modes of the system, which are the sequences that can exist in the system with zero input. These modes are precisely the eigenfunctions that are annihilated by the system operator.\n\nWe assume a solution of the form $y[n] = A z^n$, where $A$ and $z$ are constants. Substituting this into the given difference equation:\n$$\n(A z^n) - 1.2 (A z^{n-1}) + 0.36 (A z^{n-2}) = 0\n$$\nFor a non-trivial solution, we require $A \\neq 0$. We can factor out the common term $A z^{n-2}$:\n$$\nA z^{n-2} (z^2 - 1.2 z + 0.36) = 0\n$$\nSince $A z^{n-2}$ cannot be zero for all $n$ in a non-trivial solution, the term in the parenthesis must be zero. This gives the characteristic equation of the system:\n$$\nz^2 - 1.2 z + 0.36 = 0\n$$\nWe solve this quadratic equation for its roots, $z$. The equation can be rewritten by recognizing it as a perfect square:\n$$\nz^2 - 2(0.6)z + (0.6)^2 = 0\n$$\n$$\n(z - 0.6)^2 = 0\n$$\nThis equation has a repeated root of multiplicity $2$ at $z_1 = z_2 = 0.6$.\n\nWhen a characteristic equation has a repeated root, say $p$, a solution of the form $c_1 p^n$ is one mode of the system. However, a second-order system must have two linearly independent modes. The second mode is not simply $c_2 p^n$. To derive the form of the second solution from first principles, let us define the LTI operator $L$ corresponding to the difference equation:\n$$\nL\\{y[n]\\} = y[n] - 1.2 y[n-1] + 0.36 y[n-2]\n$$\nThe characteristic polynomial is $P(z) = z^2 - 1.2 z + 0.36 = (z - 0.6)^2$. Applying the operator $L$ to the eigenfunction $z^n$ yields:\n$$\nL\\{z^n\\} = z^n - 1.2 z^{n-1} + 0.36 z^{n-2} = z^{n-2}P(z)\n$$\nWe know that for a root $p$ of $P(z)$, we have $L\\{p^n\\} = p^{n-2}P(p) = 0$. For a repeated root, not only is $P(p) = 0$, but also the first derivative of the polynomial is zero at that root: $P'(p) = 0$. Let's differentiate the relation $L\\{z^n\\} = z^{n-2}P(z)$ with respect to $z$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z} L\\{z^n\\} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z} [z^{n-2}P(z)]\n$$\nSince the operator $L$ is linear with constant coefficients, we can interchange the operator and the derivative:\n$$\nL\\left\\{\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z} z^n\\right\\} = (n-2)z^{n-3}P(z) + z^{n-2}P'(z)\n$$\n$$\nL\\{n z^{n-1}\\} = (n-2)z^{n-3}P(z) + z^{n-2}P'(z)\n$$\nNow, we evaluate this expression at the repeated root $z = p = 0.6$. Since $P(0.6) = 0$ and $P'(z) = 2(z-0.6)$, which means $P'(0.6) = 0$, the entire right-hand side becomes zero:\n$$\nL\\{n (0.6)^{n-1}\\} = 0\n$$\nBy linearity, any constant multiple of $n(0.6)^{n-1}$ is also a solution. Multiplying by the constant $0.6$, we find that $L\\{n (0.6)^n\\} = 0$. Thus, the sequence $n(0.6)^n$ is the second linearly independent solution.\n\nThe general homogeneous solution is a linear combination of the two independent modes:\n$$\ny_h[n] = c_1 (0.6)^n + c_2 n(0.6)^n\n$$\nwhere $c_1$ and $c_2$ are arbitrary constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nNext, we classify the system's stability.\nAsymptotic stability concerns the behavior of the zero-input response as $n \\to \\infty$. The system is asymptotically stable if and only if all characteristic roots have magnitudes strictly less than unity, i.e., $|z_k| < 1$ for all $k$. The roots are $z_1 = z_2 = 0.6$. The magnitude is $|0.6| = 0.6$, which is less than $1$. Therefore, the system is asymptotically stable. The modes $(0.6)^n$ and $n(0.6)^n$ both decay to zero as $n \\to \\infty$. The exponential decay of $(0.6)^n$ is faster than the linear growth of $n$, ensuring that $\\lim_{n \\to \\infty} n(0.6)^n = 0$.\n\nBounded-Input Bounded-Output (BIBO) stability requires that for any bounded input, the output is also bounded. For an LTI system, this is equivalent to the condition that the impulse response $h[n]$ is absolutely summable: $\\sum_{n=-\\infty}^{\\infty} |h[n]| < \\infty$. Assuming the system is causal, the impulse response has the same form as the homogeneous solution for $n \\ge 0$, so $h[n] = (k_1(0.6)^n + k_2 n(0.6)^n) u[n]$, where $u[n]$ is the unit step function and $k_1, k_2$ are specific constants. We test for absolute summability:\n$$\n\\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} |h[n]| = \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} |k_1(0.6)^n + k_2 n(0.6)^n| \\le |k_1| \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} (0.6)^n + |k_2| \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} n(0.6)^n\n$$\nThe first sum is a geometric series with ratio $r=0.6$. Since $|r|<1$, it converges to $1/(1-0.6) = 2.5$. The second sum is an arithmetico-geometric series. Its convergence can be confirmed by the ratio test on its terms $a_n = n(0.6)^n$:\n$$\n\\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\left| \\frac{a_{n+1}}{a_n} \\right| = \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\left| \\frac{(n+1)(0.6)^{n+1}}{n(0.6)^n} \\right| = \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\left( \\frac{n+1}{n} \\right) 0.6 = (1) \\cdot 0.6 = 0.6\n$$\nSince the limit $0.6$ is less than $1$, the series $\\sum n(0.6)^n$ converges. As both sums converge, the impulse response $h[n]$ is absolutely summable. Therefore, the system is BIBO stable. The fact that the characteristic roots lie strictly inside the unit circle simultaneously guarantees both asymptotic and BIBO stability for this LTI system.\n\nFinally, the spectral radius, $\\rho$, is defined as the maximum magnitude among all characteristic roots. For this system, the roots are $z_1 = 0.6$ and $z_2 = 0.6$. Their magnitudes are $|z_1|=|0.6|=0.6$ and $|z_2|=|0.6|=0.6$.\nThe maximum of these magnitudes is:\n$$\n\\rho = \\max(|z_1|, |z_2|) = \\max(0.6, 0.6) = 0.6\n$$\nThe condition for asymptotic and BIBO stability can be concisely stated as $\\rho < 1$, which is met in this case.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{0.6}\n$$", "id": "2865609"}, {"introduction": "The theoretical concept of stability has profound practical consequences, especially when implementing digital systems with finite-precision arithmetic.
