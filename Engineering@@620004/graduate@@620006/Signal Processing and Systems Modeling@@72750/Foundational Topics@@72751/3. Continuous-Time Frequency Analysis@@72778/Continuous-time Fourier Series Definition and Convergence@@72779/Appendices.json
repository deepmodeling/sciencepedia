First, the derivation of the real trigonometric Fourier series from the given complex exponential coefficients. Second, a justification of the pointwise convergence of this series at two specified points, based on foundational principles.\n\n**Part 1: Derivation of the Trigonometric Fourier Series**\n\nThe continuous-time signal $x(t)$ is defined by its complex exponential Fourier series coefficients over a period of $T = 2\\pi$, corresponding to a fundamental frequency of $\\omega_0 = \\frac{2\\pi}{T} = 1$. The series is given by:\n$$\nx(t) = \\sum_{k=-\\infty}^{\\infty} c_{k} \\exp(j k t)\n$$\nwith coefficients:\n$$\nc_{0} = 0, \\quad c_{k} = \\frac{1}{j k} \\quad \\text{for } k \\neq 0\n$$\nThe real trigonometric Fourier series has the form:\n$$\nx(t) = \\frac{a_{0}}{2} + \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\big(a_{n} \\cos(n t) + b_{n} \\sin(n t)\\big)\n$$\nThe coefficients $a_0$, $a_n$, and $b_n$ are related to the complex coefficients $c_k$. These relationships are derived by substituting Euler's identities for cosine and sine into the trigonometric series and comparing the result with the complex exponential form. This procedure yields:\n$$\na_{0} = 2 c_{0}\n$$\n$$\na_{n} = c_{n} + c_{-n} \\quad \\text{for } n \\ge 1\n$$\n$$\nb_{n} = j(c_{n} - c_{-n}) \\quad \\text{for } n \\ge 1\n$$\nWe now compute these coefficients using the provided values of $c_k$.\n\nFor the DC component, with $c_0 = 0$:\n$$\na_{0} = 2(0) = 0\n$$\n\nFor the cosine coefficients $a_n$ where $n \\ge 1$:\n$$\nc_{n} = \\frac{1}{jn} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad c_{-n} = \\frac{1}{j(-n)} = -\\frac{1}{jn}\n$$\nTherefore,\n$$\na_{n} = \\frac{1}{jn} + \\left(-\\frac{1}{jn}\\right) = 0\n$$\nAll cosine coefficients are zero, which indicates that $x(t)$ is an odd function.\n\nFor the sine coefficients $b_n$ where $n \\ge 1$:\n$$\nb_{n} = j(c_{n} - c_{-n}) = j\\left(\\frac{1}{jn} - \\left(-\\frac{1}{jn}\\right)\\right) = j\\left(\\frac{2}{jn}\\right) = \\frac{2}{n}\n$$\nSubstituting these coefficients into the trigonometric series form, we obtain the series for $x(t)$:\n$$\nx(t) = \\frac{0}{2} + \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\left(0 \\cdot \\cos(nt) + \\frac{2}{n} \\sin(nt)\\right) = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{2}{n} \\sin(nt)\n$$\n\n**Part 2: Justification of Pointwise Convergence**\n\nThe central task here is to determine the pointwise limit of the series, denoted $S(t)$, at $t=0$ and $t=\\pi/3$. This requires a foundational justification rather than merely stating a convergence theorem.\n\nFirst, we must identify the function $x(t)$ represented by the given Fourier coefficients. The coefficients $c_k \\sim 1/|k|$ for large $|k|$ suggest that the function is discontinuous but piecewise smooth. We can identify the function by considering its derivative, $x'(t)$. The Fourier coefficients of the derivative are $c'_k = jk c_k$. For $k \\neq 0$, we have $c'_k = jk (1/(jk)) = 1$. The DC coefficient $c'_0 = j(0)c_0 = 0$. However, formal differentiation does not always yield a simple result for discontinuous functions. A more rigorous interpretation is that the Fourier series for $x'(t)$ is $\\sum_{k=-\\infty, k \\neq 0}^{\\infty} \\exp(jkt)$. This series can be recognized as the series for a periodic impulse train minus a constant:\n$$\n\\sum_{k=-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\exp(jkt) = 2\\pi \\sum_{m=-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\delta(t-2\\pi m)\n$$\nThus, the series for $x'(t)$ corresponds to $2\\pi \\sum_{m=-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\delta(t-2\\pi m) - 1$. Integrating this distribution gives a function that has a constant slope of $-1$ and jumps of size $2\\pi$ at integer multiples of $2\\pi$. This implies $x(t) = C - t$ over one period, for some constant $C$. The value of $C$ is determined by the DC offset, $c_0=0$.\n$$\nc_0 = \\frac{1}{2\\pi} \\int_{0}^{2\\pi} x(t) dt = \\frac{1}{2\\pi} \\int_{0}^{2\\pi} (C-t) dt = \\frac{1}{2\\pi} \\left[Ct - \\frac{t^2}{2}\\right]_0^{2\\pi} = \\frac{1}{2\\pi} (2\\pi C - 2\\pi^2) = C - \\pi\n$$\nSince $c_0 = 0$, we must have $C=\\pi$. Therefore, the function represented by the series is, on the interval $(0, 2\\pi)$:\n$$\nx(t) = \\pi - t\n$$\nThis function is extended periodically for all $t \\in \\mathbb{R}$. This function is piecewise linear and thus piecewise smooth.\n\nThe convergence of the Fourier series of a piecewise smooth function is governed by Dirichlet's theorem. The proof of this theorem, which constitutes the required justification, rests on the properties of the Dirichlet kernel. The partial sum of the Fourier series is given by the convolution of the function with the Dirichlet kernel $D_N(u) = \\sum_{k=-N}^N \\exp(jku) = \\frac{\\sin((N+1/2)u)}{\\sin(u/2)}$.\nThe symmetric partial sum converges to the average of the left and right-hand limits of the function:\n$$\nS(t) = \\lim_{N\\to\\infty} S_N(t) = \\frac{x(t^+) + x(t^-)}{2}\n$$\nThis result is established by expressing the difference $S_N(t) - \\frac{x(t^+) + x(t^-)}{2}$ as an integral involving the factor $\\sin((N+1/2)u)$. For a piecewise smooth function, the remaining part of the integrand is absolutely integrable, and by the Riemann-Lebesgue lemma, the integral vanishes as $N \\to \\infty$. This fundamental argument justifies applying this convergence criterion.\n\nWe now apply this result to the specified points:\n\n1.  **Convergence at the discontinuity $t=0$:**\n    The point $t=0$ is a jump discontinuity. We must evaluate the left and right-hand limits of $x(t)$ at this point.\n    The right-hand limit is found directly from the function's definition on $(0, 2\\pi)$:\n    $$\n    x(0^+) = \\lim_{t \\to 0^+} (\\pi - t) = \\pi\n    $$\n    The left-hand limit is found by using the periodicity $x(t) = x(t+2\\pi)$:\n    $$\n    x(0^-) = \\lim_{\\epsilon \\to 0^+} x(-\\epsilon) = \\lim_{\\epsilon \\to 0^+} x(2\\pi-\\epsilon) = \\lim_{t \\to (2\\pi)^-} (\\pi - t) = \\pi - 2\\pi = -\\pi\n    $$\n    The series converges to the average of these limits:\n    $$\n    S(0) = \\frac{x(0^+) + x(0^-)}{2} = \\frac{\\pi + (-\\pi)}{2} = 0\n    $$\n\n2.  **Convergence at the smooth point $t=\\pi/3$:**\n    The point $t=\\pi/3$ lies within the interval $(0, 2\\pi)$, where $x(t)$ is continuous and differentiable. At such a point, the left and right-hand limits are equal to the function's value.\n    $$\n    x((\\pi/3)^+) = x((\\pi/3)^-) = x(\\pi/3)\n    $$\n    The series therefore converges to the value of the function at that point:\n    $$\n    S(\\pi/3) = x(\\pi/3) = \\pi - \\frac{\\pi}{3} = \\frac{2\\pi}{3}\n    $$\nThis completes the justification for the pointwise limits.

We find $\\hat{\\sigma}_M(k)$ by considering its action on a single harmonic $f_{k_0}(t) = \\exp(j k_0 t)$, for which $c_k = \\delta_{k,k_0}$.\nThe $n$th partial sum of $f_{k_0}(t)$ is:\n$$S_n f_{k_0}(t) = \\begin{cases} \\exp(j k_0 t) & \\text{if } n \\ge |k_0| \\\\ 0 & \\text{if } n < |k_0| \\end{cases}$$\nThe Fejér mean is:\n$$\\sigma_{M} f_{k_0}(t) = \\frac{1}{M}\\sum_{n=0}^{M-1} S_{n} f_{k_0}(t)$$\nIf $|k_0| \\ge M$, then for all $n \\in \\{0, 1, \\dots, M-1\\}$, we have $n < |k_0|$, so $S_n f_{k_0}(t)=0$. Thus $\\sigma_M f_{k_0}(t) = 0$.\nIf $|k_0| < M$, the terms $S_n f_{k_0}(t)$ in the sum are non-zero only for $n \\ge |k_0|$. The number of such terms is $(M-1) - |k_0| + 1 = M-|k_0|$.\nSo, for $|k_0| < M$:\n$$\\sigma_{M} f_{k_0}(t) = \\frac{1}{M} \\sum_{n=|k_0|}^{M-1} \\exp(j k_0 t) = \\frac{M-|k_0|}{M} \\exp(j k_0 t)$$\nFrom this, we deduce the multiplier for the $\\sigma_M$ operator, which we denote $\\hat{\\sigma}_M(k)$:\n$$\\hat{\\sigma}_M(k) = \\begin{cases} 1 - \\frac{|k|}{M} & \\text{if } |k| < M \\\\ 0 & \\text{if } |k| \\ge M \\end{cases}$$\nThe de la Vallée Poussin mean is defined as $V_{N} f(t) = 2\\,\\sigma_{2N} f(t)-\\sigma_{N} f(t)$. Due to the linearity of the Fourier series and the operators, its multiplier $\\hat{V}_N(k)$ is given by $\\hat{V}_N(k) = 2\\hat{\\sigma}_{2N}(k) - \\hat{\\sigma}_N(k)$. We analyze this in a piecewise manner with respect to $|k|$:\n- For $|k| < N$: Both $|k| < N$ and $|k| < 2N$ hold.\n$$\\hat{V}_N(k) = 2\\left(1 - \\frac{|k|}{2N}\\right) - \\left(1 - \\frac{|k|}{N}\\right) = 2 - \\frac{|k|}{N} - 1 + \\frac{|k|}{N} = 1$$\n- For $N \\le |k| < 2N$:\n$$\\hat{V}_N(k) = 2\\left(1 - \\frac{|k|}{2N}\\right) - 0 = 2 - \\frac{|k|}{N}$$\n- For $|k| \\ge 2N$:\n$$\\hat{V}_N(k) = 2(0) - 0 = 0$$\nIn summary, the de la Vallée Poussin multiplier is a trapezoidal function in the frequency domain:\n$$ \\hat{V}_N(k) = \\begin{cases} 1 & \\text{if } |k| < N \\\\ 2 - \\frac{|k|}{N} & \\text{if } N \\le |k| < 2N \\\\ 0 & \\text{if } |k| \\ge 2N \\end{cases} $$\nNow we compute $V_N f(t)$ for $f(t) = \\cos(mt)$. The Fourier coefficients of $V_N f(t)$ are $c'_k = \\hat{V}_N(k) c_k$. The only non-zero coefficients of $f(t)$ are at $k = \\pm m$.\nGiven $m = \\frac{3N}{2}$, we have $N < m < 2N$. Thus, we are in the second case of the multiplier's definition. The multiplier at the signal's frequency is:\n$$\\hat{V}_N(\\pm m) = 2 - \\frac{| \\pm m |}{N} = 2 - \\frac{m}{N} = 2 - \\frac{3N/2}{N} = 2 - \\frac{3}{2} = \\frac{1}{2}$$\nThe coefficients of $V_N f(t)$ are $c'_m = \\hat{V}_N(m) c_m = \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{1}{4}$ and $c'_{-m} = \\hat{V}_N(-m) c_{-m} = \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{1}{4}$. All other coefficients are zero.\nReconstructing the signal $V_N f(t)$:\n$$V_N f(t) = \\frac{1}{4}\\exp(j m t) + \\frac{1}{4}\\exp(-j m t) = \\frac{1}{2} \\left( \\frac{\\exp(j m t) + \\exp(-j m t)}{2} \\right) = \\frac{1}{2}\\cos(m t)$$\nThe approximation error for the de la Vallée Poussin mean is:\n$$\\|f - V_{N} f\\|_{\\infty} = \\left\\| \\cos(m t) - \\frac{1}{2}\\cos(m t) \\right\\|_{\\infty} = \\left\\| \\frac{1}{2}\\cos(m t) \\right\\|_{\\infty} = \\frac{1}{2} \\sup_{t\\in\\mathbb{R}} |\\cos(m t)| = \\frac{1}{2}$$\n\nFinally, we conclude on the performance and provide the requested ratio.\nWe found $\\|f - S_N f\\|_{\\infty} = 1$ and $\\|f - V_N f\\|_{\\infty} = \\frac{1}{2}$. Clearly, the de la Vallée Poussin mean provides a superior approximation in the uniform norm for this specific signal.\n\nThe reason for this lies in the properties of the spectral multipliers. The partial sum operator $S_N$ corresponds to an ideal \"brick-wall\" low-pass filter with multiplier $\\hat{S}_N(k) = 1$ for $|k| \\le N$ and $0$ otherwise. The signal frequency $m = 3N/2$ falls entirely outside this passband, so the operator completely annihilates the signal, resulting in $S_N f(t) = 0$ and the maximum possible error of $1$.\n\nThe de la Vallée Poussin operator $V_N$, on the other hand, corresponds to a filter with a trapezoidal frequency response. It preserves frequencies $|k| < N$ perfectly ($\\hat{V}_N(k)=1$), but it also has a transition band for $N \\le |k| < 2N$ where the response falls linearly from $1$ to $0$. The signal frequency $m = 3N/2$ is located in the middle of this transition band, where the multiplier is non-zero, specifically $\\hat{V}_N(m)=1/2$. This allows the operator to produce an approximant $V_N f(t) = \\frac{1}{2} f(t)$, which captures half of the original signal's amplitude, thereby reducing the uniform error by a factor of two compared to the partial sum. This smoother frequency roll-off is a general feature of summability methods like the de la Vallée Poussin mean, which are designed to improve convergence properties over simple truncation.\n\nThe ratio of the errors is:\n$$R = \\frac{\\|f-V_{N} f\\|_{\\infty}}{\\|f-S_{N} f\\|_{\\infty}} = \\frac{1/2}{1} = \\frac{1}{2}$$", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\frac{1}{2}}\n$$", "id": "2860364"}]}
