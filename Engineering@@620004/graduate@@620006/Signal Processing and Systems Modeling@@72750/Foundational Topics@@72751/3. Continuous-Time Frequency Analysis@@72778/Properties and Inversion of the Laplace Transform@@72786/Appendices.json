A solution will be derived in accordance with the specified constraints.\n\nThe solution proceeds by directly applying the definition of the bilateral Laplace transform to the given signal $f(t)$.\n\nThe Laplace transform $F(s)$ is given by the integral:\n$$\nF(s) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} f(t)\\,\\exp(-s t)\\,dt\n$$\nSubstituting the expression for the signal $f(t) = \\exp(a t)\\,u(t)$:\n$$\nF(s) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\exp(a t)\\,u(t)\\,\\exp(-s t)\\,dt\n$$\nThe unit step function $u(t)$ is zero for $t  0$ and one for $t \\ge 0$. This property reduces the interval of integration from $(-\\infty, \\infty)$ to $[0, \\infty)$:\n$$\nF(s) = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\exp(a t)\\,(1)\\,\\exp(-s t)\\,dt\n$$\nWe combine the exponential terms in the integrand:\n$$\nF(s) = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\exp\\left((a - s)t\\right)\\,dt\n$$\nThis is an improper integral of a complex exponential function. The antiderivative of $\\exp\\left((a - s)t\\right)$ with respect to $t$ is $\\frac{1}{a-s}\\exp\\left((a - s)t\\right)$, provided $a-s \\neq 0$. Evaluating this integral gives:\n$$\nF(s) = \\left[ \\frac{\\exp\\left((a - s)t\\right)}{a-s} \\right]_{t=0}^{t \\to \\infty} = \\frac{1}{a-s} \\left( \\lim_{t \\to \\infty} \\exp\\left((a - s)t\\right) - \\exp(0) \\right)\n$$\nThe evaluation depends on the convergence of the limit term. The problem states that the transform is defined by the absolutely convergent integral. We must therefore determine the condition for absolute convergence. The integral converges absolutely if:\n$$\n\\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\left| \\exp\\left((a - s)t\\right) \\right| \\,dt  \\infty\n$$\nUsing the property that for any complex number $z$, $|\\exp(z)| = \\exp(\\Re(z))$, we have:\n$$\n\\left| \\exp\\left((a - s)t\\right) \\right| = \\exp\\left(\\Re\\left((a-s)t\\right)\\right)\n$$\nSince $t$ is a real, non-negative variable in the integration interval, we can write:\n$$\n\\exp\\left(\\Re\\left((a-s)t\\right)\\right) = \\exp\\left( (\\Re(a) - \\Re(s))t \\right)\n$$\nThe absolute convergence condition becomes:\n$$\n\\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\exp\\left( (\\Re(a) - \\Re(s))t \\right) \\,dt  \\infty\n$$\nThis is an integral of a real exponential function. This integral converges if and only if the coefficient of $t$ in the exponent is strictly negative. Thus, we require:\n$$\n\\Re(a) - \\Re(s)  0\n$$\nThis inequality simplifies to:\n$$\n\\Re(s)  \\Re(a)\n$$\nThis inequality defines the Region of Convergence (ROC). It is the open right half-plane in the complex $s$-plane, to the right of the vertical line defined by $\\Re(s) = \\Re(a)$.\n\nNow we can complete the evaluation of $F(s)$. The condition $\\Re(s)  \\Re(a)$ ensures that the limit $\\lim_{t \\to \\infty} \\exp\\left((a - s)t\\right)$ evaluates to $0$. This is because the magnitude of the term, $|\\exp\\left((a - s)t\\right)| = \\exp\\left( (\\Re(a) - \\Re(s))t \\right)$, tends to $0$ as $t \\to \\infty$ since its exponent's coefficient is negative.\nWith this condition, the expression for $F(s)$ becomes:\n$$\nF(s) = \\frac{1}{a-s} (0 - 1) = -\\frac{1}{a-s} = \\frac{1}{s-a}\n$$\nThis completes part (1) of the problem.\n\nFor part (2), we must determine the abscissa of convergence, $\\sigma_c$. The problem statement defines the ROC as the set $\\{\\; s \\in \\mathbb{C}\\,:\\,\\Re(s)  \\sigma_c \\;\\}$. From our derivation, the ROC is the set $\\{\\; s \\in \\mathbb{C}\\,:\\,\\Re(s)  \\Re(a) \\;\\}$. By direct comparison, we identify the abscissa of convergence as:\n$$\n\\sigma_c = \\Re(a)\n$$\nThis completes part (2).\n\nFor part (3), we interpret the result. The magnitude of the signal $f(t)$ for $t \\ge 0$ is given by $|f(t)| = |\\exp(at)| = \\exp(\\Re(a)t)$. The term $\\Re(a)$ represents the exponential growth rate of the signal's envelope. If $\\Re(a)  0$, the signal grows exponentially. If $\\Re(a)  0$, it decays. If $\\Re(a) = 0$, it has a constant-amplitude envelope.\nThe Laplace transform integral involves the product $f(t)\\exp(-st)$. The magnitude of this product is $|f(t)\\exp(-st)| = \\exp(\\Re(a)t) \\exp(-\\Re(s)t) = \\exp((\\Re(a)-\\Re(s))t)$. For the integral $\\int_0^\\infty |f(t)\\exp(-st)| dt$ to converge, the integrand must decay to zero as $t \\to \\infty$. This requires the overall exponential rate, $\\Re(a) - \\Re(s)$, to be negative. Thus, we need $\\Re(s)  \\Re(a)$. This means the exponential decay rate $\\Re(s)$ provided by the transform kernel $\\exp(-st)$ must be greater than the signal's own growth rate $\\Re(a)$ to ensure the product is an overall decaying function of time, making its integral over $[0, \\infty)$ finite.\nThe boundary line $\\Re(s) = \\sigma_c = \\Re(a)$ is excluded from the ROC precisely because absolute convergence fails on this line. If $\\Re(s) = \\Re(a)$, the integral for absolute convergence becomes:\n$$\n\\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\exp\\left( (\\Re(a) - \\Re(a))t \\right) \\,dt = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\exp(0) \\,dt = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} 1 \\,dt\n$$\nThis integral diverges to infinity. Therefore, the Laplace transform integral does not converge absolutely on the boundary of the ROC. The definition of the ROC for the bilateral Laplace transform is conventionally taken as the open set where absolute convergence holds, which guarantees the analyticity of $F(s)$ within that region.\n\nThe final answer consists of the closed-form expression for $F(s)$ and the value of $\\sigma_c$.\n$F(s) = \\frac{1}{s-a}$\n$\\sigma_c = \\Re(a)$", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n\\frac{1}{s-a}  \\Re(a)\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "2894454"}, {"introduction": "A primary application of the Laplace transform is in analyzing linear time-invariant (LTI) systems by converting differential equations into algebraic problems.

It is a legitimate, well-posed problem in the field of signal processing and systems modeling. We may proceed to the solution.\n\nThe problem requires finding the impulse response $h(t)$ of a causal LTI system whose Laplace transform is given by\n$$\nF(s) = \\frac{2s+5}{(s+1)(s+2)}.\n$$\nThe solution involves three stages as requested: justification of the partial fraction method, determination of the Region of Convergence (ROC), and calculation of the inverse transform.\n\n**1. Justification of Partial Fraction Expansion and Heaviside's Method**\n\nThe given function $F(s)$ is a rational function of the complex variable $s$, which can be written as $F(s) = \\frac{N(s)}{D(s)}$, where the numerator is $N(s) = 2s+5$ and the denominator is $D(s) = (s+1)(s+2) = s^2+3s+2$.\n\nThe degree of the numerator polynomial is $1$, and the degree of the denominator polynomial is $2$. Since the degree of the numerator is strictly less than the degree of the denominator, $F(s)$ is a strictly proper rational function. A strictly proper rational function can always be decomposed into a sum of partial fractions.\n\nThe poles of $F(s)$ are the roots of the denominator equation $D(s) = 0$.\n$$\n(s+1)(s+2) = 0\n$$\nThis gives two distinct, real poles: $s_1 = -1$ and $s_2 = -2$. Since the poles are simple (i.e., not repeated), the partial fraction expansion of $F(s)$ takes the form\n$$\nF(s) = \\frac{A_1}{s+1} + \\frac{A_2}{s+2}\n$$\nwhere $A_1$ and $A_2$ are the residues of the function at the respective poles. Heaviside's cover-up method is a direct procedure for calculating these residues for simple poles. The residue $A_k$ at a simple pole $s_k$ is given by the formula $A_k = \\lim_{s \\to s_k} (s-s_k) F(s)$. This formal limit operation is what the cover-up method implements. Therefore, because $F(s)$ is a strictly proper rational function with distinct, simple poles, its decomposition into a sum of first-order terms is valid, and Heaviside's method is the correct and applicable technique to find the coefficients.\n\n**2. Determination of the Region of Convergence (ROC)**\n\nThe poles of $F(s)$ are located at $s = -1$ and $s = -2$ in the complex plane. These poles define vertical boundaries for possible ROCs. The three possible ROCs for this function are:\n- $\\text{Re}(s)  -1$\n- $-2  \\text{Re}(s)  -1$\n- $\\text{Re}(s)  -2$\n\nThe problem states that $h(t)$ is the impulse response of a causal system, which implies $h(t) = 0$ for all $t  0$. A fundamental property of the bilateral Laplace transform is that if a signal is right-sided (which includes the case of causal signals), its ROC must be a right-half plane to the right of the rightmost pole.\n\nThe poles are at $s = -1$ and $s = -2$. The rightmost pole is $s_1 = -1$. Consequently, for the causal signal $h(t)$, the ROC must be the region to the right of this pole.\n$$\n\\text{ROC: } \\text{Re}(s)  -1\n$$\n\n**3. Inverse Laplace Transform Calculation**\n\nWith the partial fraction structure and the ROC established, we can compute the inverse transform. First, we find the coefficients $A_1$ and $A_2$ using the Heaviside method.\n\nFor $A_1$, we cover the $(s+1)$ term and evaluate at $s = -1$:\n$$\nA_1 = \\left. (s+1)F(s) \\right|_{s=-1} = \\left. \\frac{2s+5}{s+2} \\right|_{s=-1} = \\frac{2(-1)+5}{-1+2} = \\frac{3}{1} = 3.\n$$\nFor $A_2$, we cover the $(s+2)$ term and evaluate at $s = -2$:\n$$\nA_2 = \\left. (s+2)F(s) \\right|_{s=-2} = \\left. \\frac{2s+5}{s+1} \\right|_{s=-2} = \\frac{2(-2)+5}{-2+1} = \\frac{1}{-1} = -1.\n$$\nThus, the partial fraction expansion is\n$$\nF(s) = \\frac{3}{s+1} - \\frac{1}{s+2}.\n$$\nWe now invert each term using the standard Laplace transform pair $\\mathcal{L}\\{e^{-at}u(t)\\} = \\frac{1}{s+a}$ for $\\text{Re}(s)  -a$, where $u(t)$ is the Heaviside unit step function. The linearity of the inverse Laplace transform allows us to invert the sum term by term.\n\nFor the first term, $\\frac{3}{s+1}$, the pole is at $s = -1$. The ROC is $\\text{Re}(s)  -1$, which corresponds to a causal signal. Its inverse transform is:\n$$\n\\mathcal{L}^{-1}\\left\\{\\frac{3}{s+1}\\right\\} = 3 e^{-t} u(t).\n$$\nFor the second term, $-\\frac{1}{s+2}$, the pole is at $s = -2$. The ROC, $\\text{Re}(s)  -1$, is also to the right of this pole (since if $\\text{Re}(s)  -1$, it is necessarily true that $\\text{Re}(s)  -2$). This also corresponds to a causal signal. Its inverse transform is:\n$$\n\\mathcal{L}^{-1}\\left\\{-\\frac{1}{s+2}\\right\\} = -e^{-2t} u(t).\n$$\nCombining these results, we obtain the impulse response $h(t)$:\n$$\nh(t) = 3e^{-t}u(t) - e^{-2t}u(t).\n$$\nThis expression can be written in a more compact form:\n$$\nh(t) = (3e^{-t} - e^{-2t})u(t).\n$$\nThis function is zero for $t0$, which is consistent with the initial condition of causality.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{(3\\exp(-t) - \\exp(-2t))u(t)}\n$$", "id": "2894382"}, {"introduction": "Building upon the technique for simple poles, this practice addresses a more complex and common scenario in system modeling: the presence of repeated poles in the transfer function.
