In this region, the transform is:\n$$X_{4}(s) = \\frac{1}{2j}\\left(\\frac{1}{jb-s} - \\frac{1}{-jb-s}\\right) = \\frac{1}{2j}\\left(\\frac{-1}{s-jb} - \\frac{-1}{s+jb}\\right) = -\\frac{1}{2j}\\left(\\frac{1}{s-jb} - \\frac{1}{s+jb}\\right) = -\\frac{b}{s^2+b^2}$$\nThe poles of $X_{4}(s)$ are at $s = \\pm jb$. The ROC is the left-half plane $\\text{Re}(s) < 0$.\n\n**Analysis and Contrast**\n\nThe poles of all four transforms $X_{k}(s)$ are located at $s = \\pm jb$. These locations are determined by the complex exponential components $\\exp(\\pm jbt)$ that constitute the sinusoidal signals. The Laplace transform of a pure complex exponential $\\exp(a_0 t)$ has a pole at $s=a_0$. Here, the sinusoidal signals are linear combinations of complex exponentials with $a_0 = \\pm jb$, so the poles are at $s = \\pm jb$. The multiplication by a step function does not alter the location of these poles; it only determines the region of convergence.\n\nThe signals $x_{1}(t)$ and $x_{2}(t)$ are right-sided, as they are non-zero only for $t \\ge 0$. Correspondingly, their ROCs, $\\text{Re}(s) > 0$, are right-half planes. The vertical line $\\text{Re}(s)=0$ that forms the boundary of the ROC is determined by the real part of the poles. Since the poles $\\pm jb$ lie on this boundary, the ROC is the open half-plane to the right of the poles.\n\nConversely, the signals $x_{3}(t)$ and $x_{4}(t)$ are left-sided, as they are non-zero only for $t \\le 0$. Their ROCs, $\\text{Re}(s) < 0$, are left-half planes. The ROC is the open half-plane to the left of the poles.\n\nThis demonstrates a fundamental property of the bilateral Laplace transform: right-sided signals have ROCs that are right-half planes (or extend to the right from the rightmost pole), while left-sided signals have ROCs that are left-half planes (or extend to the left from the leftmost pole). The poles themselves are intrinsic to the behavior of the function over time, independent of its duration.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{s}{s^2+b^2} & \\frac{b}{s^2+b^2} & -\\frac{s}{s^2+b^2} & -\\frac{b}{s^2+b^2} \\end{pmatrix}}$$", "id": "2854548"}, {"introduction": "While the bilateral transform is a powerful analytical tool, the unilateral transform is specifically adapted for solving initial value problems, a common task in engineering and physics.

Here, the argument of $s+a$ is $-\\pi$. So, $s+a = \\rho \\exp(-i\\pi)$.\nThus, $\\sqrt{s+a} = \\sqrt{\\rho} \\exp(-i\\pi/2) = -i\\sqrt{\\rho}$.\nWe parameterize with $s = -a-\\rho$, so $ds = -d\\rho$. The variable $\\rho$ goes from $0$ to $\\infty$.\n$$\n\\int_{\\mathcal{C}_d} \\frac{\\exp(st)}{\\sqrt{s+a}} ds = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\frac{\\exp((-a-\\rho)t)}{-i\\sqrt{\\rho}} (-d\\rho) = \\frac{\\exp(-at)}{i} \\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\rho^{-1/2} \\exp(-\\rho t) d\\rho\n$$\nThe Bromwich integral is therefore:\n$$\n\\int_{\\mathcal{C}_B} = - \\left( \\frac{\\exp(-at)}{i} \\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\rho^{-1/2} \\exp(-\\rho t) d\\rho + \\frac{\\exp(-at)}{i} \\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\rho^{-1/2} \\exp(-\\rho t) d\\rho \\right)\n$$\n$$\n\\int_{\\mathcal{C}_B} = -\\frac{2\\exp(-at)}{i} \\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\rho^{-1/2} \\exp(-\\rho t) d\\rho\n$$\nTo evaluate the remaining integral, we use the substitution $y = \\rho t$, so $\\rho = y/t$ and $d\\rho = dy/t$.\n$$\n\\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\rho^{-1/2} \\exp(-\\rho t) d\\rho = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} (y/t)^{-1/2} \\exp(-y) (dy/t) = t^{1/2} t^{-1} \\int_{0}^{\\infty} y^{-1/2} \\exp(-y) dy = t^{-1/2} \\int_{0}^{\\infty} y^{\\frac{1}{2}-1} \\exp(-y) dy\n$$\nThis last integral is the Gamma function $\\Gamma(1/2)$. Given $\\Gamma(1/2) = \\sqrt{\\pi}$.\n$$\n\\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\rho^{-1/2} \\exp(-\\rho t) d\\rho = t^{-1/2} \\Gamma(1/2) = \\frac{\\sqrt{\\pi}}{\\sqrt{t}}\n$$\nSubstituting this back into the expression for the Bromwich integral:\n$$\n\\int_{\\mathcal{C}_B} = -\\frac{2\\exp(-at)}{i} \\frac{\\sqrt{\\pi}}{\\sqrt{t}}\n$$\nFinally, we find $x(t)$:\n$$\nx(t) = \\frac{1}{2\\pi i} \\int_{\\mathcal{C}_B} = \\frac{1}{2\\pi i} \\left( -\\frac{2\\exp(-at)\\sqrt{\\pi}}{i\\sqrt{t}} \\right) = \\frac{-\\exp(-at)\\sqrt{\\pi}}{\\pi i^2 \\sqrt{t}} = \\frac{\\exp(-at)\\sqrt{\\pi}}{\\pi \\sqrt{t}} = \\frac{\\exp(-at)}{\\sqrt{\\pi t}}\n$$\nThis result is valid for $t > 0$.\n\nCase 2: $t < 0$.\nFor $t < 0$, the term $\\exp(st)$ decays as $\\operatorname{Re}(s) \\to +\\infty$. We close the Bromwich contour with a large semi-circular arc in the right half-plane. The function $X(s)\\exp(st)$ is analytic everywhere inside and on this closed contour (since the branch cut is in the left half-plane). By Cauchy's Integral Theorem, the integral over this closed path is zero. The integral over the semi-circular arc vanishes as its radius tends to infinity for $t<0$. Thus, the Bromwich integral itself must be zero.\n$$\nx(t) = 0 \\quad \\text{for } t < 0\n$$\n\nCombining the results for $t > 0$ and $t < 0$ using the unit-step function $u(t)$ defined as $u(t)=1$ for $t\\ge 0$ and $u(t)=0$ for $t<0$, we obtain the complete solution:\n$$\nx(t) = \\frac{\\exp(-at)}{\\sqrt{\\pi t}} u(t)\n$$\nThis expression represents a function that is zero for negative time and has an integrable singularity at $t=0$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\frac{\\exp(-at) u(t)}{\\sqrt{\\pi t}}}\n$$", "id": "2854529"}]}
