Derivation of the Transfer Function $H(s)$**\n\nTo derive the transfer function $H(s)$, we apply the unilateral Laplace transform to the state-space equations, under the specified condition of zero initial state, i.e., $x(0) = 0$. Let $X(s) = \\mathcal{L}\\{x(t)\\}$, $U(s) = \\mathcal{L}\\{u(t)\\}$, and $Y(s) = \\mathcal{L}\\{y(t)\\}$.\n\nThe Laplace transform of the state equation is:\n$$\ns X(s) - x(0) = A X(s) + B U(s)\n$$\nApplying the zero initial condition $x(0)=0$:\n$$\ns X(s) = A X(s) + B U(s)\n$$\nWe must now solve for the state vector in the frequency domain, $X(s)$.\n$$\ns X(s) - A X(s) = B U(s)\n$$\n$$\n(sI - A) X(s) = B U(s)\n$$\nwhere $I$ is the identity matrix of appropriate dimension ($4 \\times 4$ in this case). Assuming $(sI - A)$ is invertible, which holds for any $s$ that is not an eigenvalue of $A$, we can write:\n$$\nX(s) = (sI - A)^{-1} B U(s)\n$$\nNext, we take the Laplace transform of the output equation:\n$$\nY(s) = C X(s) + D U(s)\n$$\nSubstituting the expression for $X(s)$ into the output equation yields:\n$$\nY(s) = C \\left( (sI - A)^{-1} B U(s) \\right) + D U(s)\n$$\nBy factoring out $U(s)$, we obtain the relationship between the output $Y(s)$ and the input $U(s)$:\n$$\nY(s) = \\left[ C(sI - A)^{-1} B + D \\right] U(s)\n$$\nThe transfer function $H(s)$ is defined as the ratio $Y(s)/U(s)$.

Computation of $H(s)$ and Pole Analysis**\n\nThe problem provides block-structured matrices and specifies $D=0$. The transfer function simplifies to $H(s) = C(sI - A)^{-1} B$. The matrix $(sI - A)$ is:\n$$\nsI - A = \\begin{pmatrix} sI_{2} - A_{o}  0 \\\\ 0  sI_{2} - A_{u} \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nIts inverse is also block-diagonal:\n$$\n(sI - A)^{-1} = \\begin{pmatrix} (sI_{2} - A_{o})^{-1}  0 \\\\ 0  (sI_{2} - A_{u})^{-1} \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nSubstituting the block matrices for $A$, $B$, and $C$ into the formula for $H(s)$:\n$$\nH(s) = \\begin{pmatrix} C_{o}  0 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} (sI_{2} - A_{o})^{-1}  0 \\\\ 0  (sI_{2} - A_{u})^{-1} \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} B_{o} \\\\ B_{u} \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nPerforming the matrix multiplication:\n$$\nH(s) = \\begin{pmatrix} C_{o}(sI_{2} - A_{o})^{-1}  0 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} B_{o} \\\\ B_{u} \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\n$$\nH(s) = C_{o}(sI_{2} - A_{o})^{-1} B_{o} + 0 \\cdot (sI_{2} - A_{u})^{-1} B_{u}\n$$\nThe calculation simplifies to $H(s) = C_{o}(sI_{2} - A_{o})^{-1} B_{o}$. This demonstrates that the subsystem described by $(A_u, B_u)$ is disconnected from the output. We now compute this expression explicitly.\nFirst, we find $(sI_{2} - A_{o})^{-1}$ for $A_{o} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0  1 \\\\ -2  -3 \\end{pmatrix}$:\n$$\nsI_{2} - A_{o} = \\begin{pmatrix} s  -1 \\\\ 2  s+3 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe determinant is $\\det(sI_{2} - A_{o}) = s(s+3) - (-1)(2) = s^{2} + 3s + 2 = (s+1)(s+2)$.\nThe inverse is:\n$$\n(sI_{2} - A_{o})^{-1} = \\frac{1}{s^{2} + 3s + 2} \\begin{pmatrix} s+3  1 \\\\ -2  s \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nNow, we compute $H(s)$ using $C_{o} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1  0 \\end{pmatrix}$ and $B_{o} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}$:\n$$\nH(s) = \\begin{pmatrix} 1  0 \\end{pmatrix} \\left( \\frac{1}{s^{2} + 3s + 2} \\begin{pmatrix} s+3  1 \\\\ -2  s \\end{pmatrix} \\right) \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\n$$\nH(s) = \\frac{1}{s^{2} + 3s + 2} \\begin{pmatrix} 1  0 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ s \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\n$$\nH(s) = \\frac{1}{s^{2} + 3s + 2}\n$$\nThe poles of $H(s)$ are the roots of the denominator, $s^{2} + 3s + 2 = (s+1)(s+2) = 0$. The poles are at $s = -1$ and $s = -2$.\n\nNow we compare these poles to the eigenvalues of the full state matrix $A$. Since $A$ is block-diagonal, its eigenvalues are the union of the eigenvalues of $A_o$ and $A_u$.\nThe eigenvalues of $A_o$ are the roots of $\\det(sI_2 - A_o) = s^2+3s+2=0$, which are $\\lambda_1 = -1$ and $\\lambda_2 = -2$.\nThe matrix $A_{u} = \\begin{pmatrix} -4  1 \\\\ 0  -5 \\end{pmatrix}$ is upper triangular, so its eigenvalues are its diagonal entries: $\\lambda_3 = -4$ and $\\lambda_4 = -5$.\nThe set of eigenvalues of $A$ is $\\{-1, -2, -4, -5\\}$. The set of poles of $H(s)$ is $\\{-1, -2\\}$.\nThe poles associated with the eigenvalues of $A_u$ ($-4$ and $-5$) are absent from the transfer function $H(s)$. This phenomenon is known as pole-zero cancellation and is a direct consequence of the system's structure, specifically its lack of observability.\n\n**3. Observability and Minimal Realization**\n\nA system $(C, A)$ is observable if and only if its observability matrix $\\mathcal{O}$ has full rank, i.e., $\\text{rank}(\\mathcal{O}) = n$, where $n$ is the dimension of the state space. The observability matrix for this $n=4$ system is:\n$$\n\\mathcal{O} = \\begin{pmatrix} C \\\\ CA \\\\ CA^2 \\\\ CA^3 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nGiven $C = \\begin{pmatrix} C_o  0 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1  0  0  0 \\end{pmatrix}$ and $A = \\begin{pmatrix} A_o  0 \\\\ 0  A_u \\end{pmatrix}$.\n$$\nCA = \\begin{pmatrix} 1  0  0  0 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} 0  1  0  0 \\\\ -2  -3  0  0 \\\\ 0  0  -4  1 \\\\ 0  0  0  -5 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0  1  0  0 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\n$$\nCA^2 = (CA)A = \\begin{pmatrix} 0  1  0  0 \\end{pmatrix} A = \\begin{pmatrix} -2  -3  0  0 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe observability matrix is:\n$$\n\\mathcal{O} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1  0  0  0 \\\\ 0  1  0  0 \\\\ -2  -3  0  0 \\\\ \\dots  \\dots  0  0 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nIt is immediately obvious that the last two columns are zero vectors. The rank of $\\mathcal{O}$ is the rank of its first two columns, which is $2$. Since $\\text{rank}(\\mathcal{O}) = 2  4$, the system is not observable.\n\nThe unobservable subspace is the null space of $\\mathcal{O}$. For a vector $x = (x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4)^T$ to be in this subspace, $\\mathcal{O}x=0$. This requires $x_1=0$ and $x_2=0$. Thus, the unobservable subspace is the set of all vectors of the form $(0, 0, x_3, x_4)^T$, which is precisely the state subspace associated with the block $A_u$. Let the state vector be partitioned as $x(t) = \\begin{pmatrix} x_o(t) \\\\ x_u(t) \\end{pmatrix}$. The unobservable subspace corresponds to states where $x_o(t) = 0$.\n\nThe reason these unobservable modes do not contribute to $H(s)$ is found in the output equation itself. The output is $y(t) = C x(t) = \\begin{pmatrix} C_o  0 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} x_o(t) \\\\ x_u(t) \\end{pmatrix} = C_o x_o(t)$. The output $y(t)$ depends exclusively on the state sub-vector $x_o(t)$. Even though dynamics of the subsystem $x_u(t)$ are excited by the input $u(t)$ via $\\dot{x}_u(t) = A_u x_u(t) + B_u u(t)$, the state $x_u(t)$ is never \"seen\" by the output. The modes of this subsystem, which are the eigenvalues of $A_u$, are therefore hidden from the input-output relationship, which is what the transfer function represents.\n\nA minimal realization of a transfer function is a state-space representation that is both controllable and observable. The given realization is not minimal because it is not observable. By restricting the system to its observable part, we obtain a minimal realization. The block-diagonal structure of $A$ and the specific forms of $B$ and $C$ provide a Kalman decomposition into an observable part and an unobservable part. The observable part is defined by $(A_o, B_o, C_o)$. This subsystem corresponds to a realization of order $2$. We must verify that it is minimal. Observability of $(C_o, A_o)$ is confirmed by $\\mathcal{O}_o = \\begin{pmatrix}C_o \\\\ C_o A_o \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1  0 \\\\ 0  1 \\end{pmatrix}$, which has rank $2$. Controllability of $(A_o, B_o)$ is confirmed by $\\mathcal{C}_o = \\begin{pmatrix} B_o  A_o B_o \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0  1 \\\\ 1  -3 \\end{pmatrix}$, which also has rank $2$. Since the $(A_o, B_o, C_o)$ subsystem is both controllable and observable, it constitutes a minimal realization.\n\n**4. Transfer Function of the Minimal Realization, $H_{\\min}(s)$**\n\nThe transfer function of the minimal realization, $H_{\\min}(s)$, is the transfer function of the observable and controllable subsystem $(A_o, B_o, C_o)$. This is precisely the function $H(s)$ we calculated in part 2, where the unobservable dynamics were canceled out.\n$$\nH_{\\min}(s) = C_{o}(sI_{2} - A_{o})^{-1} B_{o} = \\frac{1}{s^{2} + 3s + 2}\n$$\nThis is the required simplified rational function.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\frac{1}{s^{2} + 3s + 2}}\n$$", "id": "2880765"}]}
