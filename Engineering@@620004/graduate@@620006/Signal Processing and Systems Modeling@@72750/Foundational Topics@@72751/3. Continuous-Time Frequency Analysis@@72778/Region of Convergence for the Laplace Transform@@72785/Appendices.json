It is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and contains sufficient, consistent information to determine a unique solution. We will proceed with the analysis.\n\nThe given transfer function is a rational function of the complex variable $s$:\n$$\nH(s) = \\frac{1}{(s+a)(s-b)}\n$$\nThe poles of $H(s)$ are the roots of the denominator, located at $s_1 = -a$ and $s_2 = b$. Since it is given that $a  0$ and $b  0$, the pole $s_1$ is in the left-half of the complex plane, and the pole $s_2$ is in the right-half.\n\nThe region of convergence (ROC) is specified as the vertical strip $-a  \\Re\\{s\\}  b$. This ROC is bounded by the two poles and does not extend to infinity in either direction, which indicates that the corresponding impulse response $h(t)$ must be a two-sided signal.\n\nTo find the impulse response $h(t)$, we first perform a partial fraction expansion of $H(s)$:\n$$\nH(s) = \\frac{A}{s+a} + \\frac{B}{s-b}\n$$\nThe coefficient $A$ is found by the residue method:\n$$\nA = \\lim_{s \\to -a} (s+a)H(s) = \\lim_{s \\to -a} \\frac{1}{s-b} = \\frac{1}{-a-b} = -\\frac{1}{a+b}\n$$\nSimilarly, the coefficient $B$ is:\n$$\nB = \\lim_{s \\to b} (s-b)H(s) = \\lim_{s \\to b} \\frac{1}{s+a} = \\frac{1}{b+a}\n$$\nThus, the expanded transfer function is:\n$$\nH(s) = \\frac{1}{a+b} \\left( \\frac{1}{s-b} - \\frac{1}{s+a} \\right)\n$$\nWe now find the inverse Laplace transform of each term, taking into account the specified ROC, $-a  \\Re\\{s\\}  b$.

A system is causal if its impulse response $h(t) = 0$ for all $t  0$. The derived impulse response contains the term $-\\frac{1}{a+b}\\exp(bt)u(-t)$. The function $u(-t)$ is equal to $1$ for $t  0$ and $0$ for $t  0$. Therefore, for any $t  0$, $h(t) = -\\frac{1}{a+b}\\exp(bt)$, which is non-zero. Since the impulse response is non-zero for $t  0$, the system is noncausal. This is a direct result of the pole at $s=b$ in the right-half plane being associated with a left-sided ROC component.\n\nSecond, BIBO stability. A linear time-invariant system is Bounded-Input Bounded-Output (BIBO) stable if and only if its impulse response is absolutely integrable, i.e., $\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} |h(t)|\\,dt  \\infty$. The problem statement correctly notes that this is equivalent to the ROC of $H(s)$ containing the imaginary axis, $\\Re\\{s\\} = 0$. Given $a  0$ and $b  0$, the ROC $-a  \\Re\\{s\\}  b$ clearly contains the line $\\Re\\{s\\}=0$. To verify this explicitly, we calculate the integral of $|h(t)|$:\n$$\n\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} |h(t)|\\,dt = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\left| -\\frac{1}{a+b} \\left( \\exp(-at)u(t) + \\exp(bt)u(-t) \\right) \\right|\\,dt\n$$\nSince $a  0$ and $b  0$, the factor $\\frac{1}{a+b}$ is positive. The functions $u(t)$ and $u(-t)$ are supported on disjoint intervals $(0, \\infty)$ and $(-\\infty, 0)$ respectively. Both exponential terms are positive on their respective intervals of support. Therefore, the absolute value can be removed and the integral split:\n$$\n\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} |h(t)|\\,dt = \\frac{1}{a+b} \\left( \\int_{-\\infty}^{0} \\exp(bt)\\,dt + \\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\exp(-at)\\,dt \\right)\n$$\nWe evaluate each integral:\n$$\n\\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\exp(-at)\\,dt = \\left[ -\\frac{1}{a}\\exp(-at) \\right]_{0}^{\\infty} = 0 - \\left(-\\frac{1}{a}\\right) = \\frac{1}{a}\n$$\nThis integral converges because $a  0$.\n$$\n\\int_{-\\infty}^{0} \\exp(bt)\\,dt = \\left[ \\frac{1}{b}\\exp(bt) \\right]_{-\\infty}^{0} = \\frac{1}{b} - 0 = \\frac{1}{b}\n$$\nThis integral converges because $b  0$.\nSumming the results:\n$$\n\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} |h(t)|\\,dt = \\frac{1}{a+b} \\left( \\frac{1}{b} + \\frac{1}{a} \\right) = \\frac{1}{a+b} \\left( \\frac{a+b}{ab} \\right) = \\frac{1}{ab}\n$$\nSince $a  0$ and $b  0$, the result $\\frac{1}{ab}$ is a finite positive number.

It presents a standard exercise in the analysis of linear time-invariant systems using the bilateral Laplace transform. All necessary information is provided to determine a unique solution. We may therefore proceed.\n\nThe given Laplace transform is\n$$X(s) = \\frac{s-3}{(s-3)(s+1)}.$$\nFrom a function-theoretic perspective, this expression is identical to the function $X_{simp}(s) = \\frac{1}{s+1}$ for all $s \\in \\mathbb{C}$ except for the point $s=3$, where the original expression is undefined. The Laplace transform is defined by an integral, and the value of a function at a single removable singularity does not alter the value of its integral. Thus, for the purpose of finding the inverse transform, we must consider the simplified form\n$$X(s) = \\frac{1}{s+1}.$$\nThis function has a single pole at $s = -1$.\n\nThe Region of Convergence (ROC) for a rational Laplace transform is always a vertical strip or half-plane bounded by vertical lines passing through the poles. For a function with a single pole at $s = \\sigma_0$, there are two possible ROCs: the right half-plane $\\text{Re}(s)  \\sigma_0$ or the left half-plane $\\text{Re}(s)  \\sigma_0$. In this case, with the pole at $s = -1$, the possible ROCs are $\\text{Re}(s)  -1$ or $\\text{Re}(s)  -1$.\n\nThe problem states that the signal $x(t)$ is right-sided, meaning $x(t) = 0$ for $t  0$. A fundamental property of the bilateral Laplace transform dictates that a right-sided signal must have an ROC that is a right half-plane, defined by $\\text{Re}(s)  \\sigma_{max}$, where $\\sigma_{max}$ is the real part of the rightmost pole of $X(s)$. For the simplified function $X(s) = \\frac{1}{s+1}$, the only pole is at $s=-1$. Therefore, the ROC consistent with a right-sided signal is\n$$\\text{Re}(s)  -1.$$\nTo find the time-domain signal $x(t)$, we must find the inverse Laplace transform of $X(s) = \\frac{1}{s+1}$ for this specific ROC.

This confirms the consistency of our result.\n\nNow, we must explain the effect of the pole-zero cancellation.

For a right-sided signal $x_{nc}(t)$, the ROC would be determined by the rightmost pole, which is at $s = 3$. The ROC would be $\\text{Re}(s)  3$. Using partial fraction expansion, we find\n$$X_{nc}(s) = \\frac{\\frac{1}{4}}{s-3} - \\frac{\\frac{1}{4}}{s+1}.$$\nThe inverse Laplace transform for the ROC $\\text{Re}(s)  3$ is\n$$x_{nc}(t) = \\left(\\frac{1}{4}\\exp(3t) - \\frac{1}{4}\\exp(-t)\\right)u(t).$$\nThe pole-zero cancellation in the original problem at $s = 3$ has two critical consequences:\n\n$1$. Enlargement of the Region of Convergence: The cancellation removes the pole at $s=3$. The rightmost pole of $X(s)$ is now at $s=-1$ instead of $s=3$. Consequently, the ROC for the right-sided signal, which is the half-plane $\\text{Re}(s)  \\sigma_{max}$, is enlarged from $\\text{Re}(s)  3$ to $\\text{Re}(s)  -1$. The set of complex frequencies $s$ for which the transform integral converges is significantly larger.\n\n$2$. Simplification and Stabilization of the Time-Domain Signal: The pole at $s = 3$ in the non-canceled function corresponds to the time-domain term $\\frac{1}{4}\\exp(3t)u(t)$. This term represents an unstable mode, as it grows exponentially without bound as $t \\to \\infty$. By canceling the pole at $s=3$ with a zero at the same location, this unstable mode is eliminated from the system's response. The resulting signal, $x(t) = \\exp(-t)u(t)$, is not only simpler (a single exponential term) but also stable, decaying to zero as $t \\to \\infty$. The pole-zero cancellation effectively removes the component of the signal that grows uncontrollably.\n\nThe final expression for $x(t)$ is thus uniquely determined by the simplified transform and the right-sided condition.", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{\\exp(-t)u(t)} $$", "id": "2900063"}]}
