The concepts of discrete-time systems, operators, and the property of time invariance are fundamental and well-defined within this domain. The problem is scientifically sound.\n- **Well-Posed:** The problem provides all necessary definitions for the system and operators, and it clearly states the tasks to be performed. A unique analytical expression for the discrepancy operator can be derived.

A complete, reasoned solution will now be provided.\n\nThe objective is to determine if the system $T$ defined by $y[n] = (-1)^{n} x[n]$ is time-invariant. The criterion for time invariance is that the output due to a shifted input must be equal to the shifted output. That is, the system is time-invariant if and only if $T\\{S_{n_0}\\{x\\}\\}[n] = S_{n_0}\\{T\\{x\\}\\}[n]$ for all possible input signals $x[n]$ and all integer time shifts $n_0$. We will compute both terms and find the discrepancy $\\Delta_{n_0}\\{x\\}[n]$.\n\nFirst, we compute the output from a time-shifted input. Let the shifted input be $x_1[n] = (S_{n_0}\\{x\\})[n] = x[n - n_0]$. The system $T$ acts on this input $x_1[n]$ to produce an output $y_1[n]$:\n$$y_1[n] = T\\{x_1\\}[n] = (-1)^{n} x_1[n]$$\nSubstituting the definition of $x_1[n]$, we get the first term of the discrepancy operator:\n$$T\\{S_{n_0}\\{x\\}\\}[n] = (-1)^{n} x[n - n_0]$$\n\nSecond, we compute the time-shifted output. The original output of the system for an input $x[n]$ is $y[n] = T\\{x\\}[n] = (-1)^{n} x[n]$. Now, we apply the time-shift operator $S_{n_0}$ to this output signal $y[n]$. The result, let us call it $y_2[n]$, is:\n$$y_2[n] = (S_{n_0}\\{y\\})[n] = y[n - n_0]$$\nTo find the explicit form, we substitute the definition of $y[n]$ into this expression. It is crucial to replace every instance of the time index $n$ in the expression for $y[n]$ with $(n - n_0)$:\n$$S_{n_0}\\{T\\{x\\}\\}[n] = (-1)^{n - n_0} x[n - n_0]$$\n\nNow we can compute the discrepancy operator $\\Delta_{n_0}\\{x\\}[n]$ as defined:\n$$\\Delta_{n_0}\\{x\\}[n] = T\\{S_{n_0}\\{x\\}\\}[n] - S_{n_0}\\{T\\{x\\}\\}[n]$$\n$$\\Delta_{n_0}\\{x\\}[n] = (-1)^{n} x[n - n_0] - (-1)^{n - n_0} x[n - n_0]$$\nWe can factor out the common term $x[n - n_0]$:\n$$\\Delta_{n_0}\\{x\\}[n] = \\left( (-1)^{n} - (-1)^{n - n_0} \\right) x[n - n_0]$$\nTo simplify the expression in the parenthesis, we use the property of exponents $(-1)^{a-b} = (-1)^a (-1)^{-b}$. Since $-1 = (-1)^{-1}$, we have $(-1)^{-b} = (-1)^b$. Thus, $(-1)^{n-n_0} = (-1)^n (-1)^{-n_0} = (-1)^n (-1)^{n_0}$.\nSubstituting this back into the expression for the discrepancy:\n$$\\Delta_{n_0}\\{x\\}[n] = \\left( (-1)^{n} - (-1)^{n} (-1)^{n_0} \\right) x[n - n_0]$$\nFactoring out the term $(-1)^{n}$ yields the final closed-form expression:\n$$\\Delta_{n_0}\\{x\\}[n] = (-1)^{n} \\left( 1 - (-1)^{n_0} \\right) x[n - n_0]$$\n\nFor the system to be time-invariant, $\\Delta_{n_0}\\{x\\}[n]$ must be identically zero for all $x[n]$, all $n$, and all integer shifts $n_0$. This requires the factor $(1 - (-1)^{n_0})$ to be zero for all $n_0 \\in \\mathbb{Z}$.\nIf $n_0$ is an even integer, $n_0 = 2k$ for some integer $k$, then $(-1)^{n_0} = (-1)^{2k} = 1$, and $(1 - (-1)^{n_0}) = 1 - 1 = 0$.\nHowever, if $n_0$ is an odd integer, $n_0 = 2k + 1$, then $(-1)^{n_0} = (-1)^{2k+1} = -1$, and $(1 - (-1)^{n_0}) = 1 - (-1) = 2$.\nSince the factor is not zero for all integer shifts $n_0$, the discrepancy $\\Delta_{n_0}\\{x\\}[n]$ is not identically zero. Therefore, the system $T$ is not time-invariant; it is time-varying.\n\nTo provide a specific counterexample, we must choose an input $x[n]$ and an odd shift $n_0$ such that the result is non-zero. Let us choose a simple non-trivial input, the Kroenecker delta function $x[n] = \\delta[n]$, and an odd shift, $n_0 = 1$.\nThe discrepancy is:\n$$\\Delta_{1}\\{\\delta\\}[n] = (-1)^{n} \\left( 1 - (-1)^{1} \\right) \\delta[n - 1]$$\n$$\\Delta_{1}\\{\\delta\\}[n] = (-1)^{n} \\left( 1 - (-1) \\right) \\delta[n - 1] = 2 (-1)^{n} \\delta[n - 1]$$\nThis expression is zero for all $n \\neq 1$. At $n = 1$, we have:\n$$\\Delta_{1}\\{\\delta\\}[1] = 2 (-1)^{1} \\delta[1 - 1] = -2 \\delta[0] = -2$$\nSince $\\Delta_{1}\\{\\delta\\}[1] = -2 \\neq 0$, we have a specific counterexample that confirms the system is not time-invariant.

The problem does not violate any of the criteria for invalidity. It is a standard, formal problem in system analysis.\n\nStep 3: Verdict and Action.\nThe problem is valid. We proceed with the solution.\n\nThe condition for time invariance with respect to a specific shift $\\tau$ is the commutation of the operator $T$ with the shift operator $S_{\\tau}$:\n$$ (T \\circ S_{\\tau})\\{x\\}(t) = (S_{\\tau} \\circ T)\\{x\\}(t) $$\nWe must evaluate both sides of this equation.\n\nThe left-hand side (LHS) is the operator $T$ applied to the shifted signal $S_{\\tau}x$.\nLet $y(t) = (S_{\\tau}x)(t) = x(t - \\tau)$.\nThen, the LHS is $(T\\{y\\})(t) = y(t^{2}) = x(t^{2} - \\tau)$.\n\nThe right-hand side (RHS) is the shift operator $S_{\\tau}$ applied to the transformed signal $T\\{x\\}$.\nLet $z(t) = (T\\{x\\})(t) = x(t^{2})$.\nThen, the RHS is $(S_{\\tau}\\{z\\})(t) = z(t - \\tau) = x((t-\\tau)^{2})$.\n\nFor the time-invariance condition to hold for a specific $\\tau$, we must have:\n$$ x(t^{2} - \\tau) = x((t-\\tau)^{2}) $$\nThis equality must be satisfied for every admissible signal $x$ and for all $t$ for which the expressions are defined. Since the function $x$ is arbitrary, the only way for this equality to hold universally is if the arguments of the function are identical. If the arguments were different, one could construct a signal $x$ for which the equality fails. For example, if $A \\neq B$, the signal $x(u) = u$ would yield $A \\neq B$.\n\nThus, the condition simplifies to an algebraic identity that must hold for all relevant $t$:\n$$ t^{2} - \\tau = (t-\\tau)^{2} $$\nExpanding the right-hand side gives:\n$$ t^{2} - \\tau = t^{2} - 2t\\tau + \\tau^{2} $$\nSubtracting $t^{2}$ from both sides yields:\n$$ -\\tau = -2t\\tau + \\tau^{2} $$\nRearranging the terms, we obtain:\n$$ 2t\\tau - \\tau - \\tau^{2} = 0 $$\nFactoring out $\\tau$ gives the central condition:\n$$ \\tau(2t - 1 - \\tau) = 0 $$\nThis equation must be satisfied for all values of $t$ in the relevant domain, which we now analyze for each case.\n\nCase A: The domain of $x$ is $\\mathbb{R}$.\nFor any $t, \\tau \\in \\mathbb{R}$, both $t^{2} - \\tau$ and $(t-\\tau)^{2}$ are real numbers. Thus, both sides of the commutation relation are defined for all $t \\in \\mathbb{R}$. The condition $\\tau(2t - 1 - \\tau) = 0$ must therefore hold for all $t \\in \\mathbb{R}$.\nThis leaves two possibilities:\n1. $\\tau = 0$. In this case, the equation becomes $0 \\cdot (2t - 1 - 0) = 0$, which is true for all $t \\in \\mathbb{R}$. So, $\\tau=0$ is a valid solution.\n2. $\\tau \\neq 0$. In this case, we must have $2t - 1 - \\tau = 0$ for all $t \\in \\mathbb{R}$. This implies $t = \\frac{1+\\tau}{2}$. However, this equality cannot hold for all real numbers $t$; it holds only for a single value of $t$. This is a contradiction.\nTherefore, the only value of $\\tau$ for which the condition holds in Case A is $\\tau = 0$. The set of such shifts is $\\{0\\}$.\n\nCase B: The domain of $x$ is $[0, \\infty)$.\nThe output of the system is defined only when the argument of $x$ is non-negative.\nFor the LHS, $x(t^{2} - \\tau)$, we require $t^{2} - \\tau \\ge 0$, or $t^{2} \\ge \\tau$.\nFor the RHS, $x((t-\\tau)^{2})$, we require $(t-\\tau)^{2} \\ge 0$. This condition is always satisfied for any real $t$ and $\\tau$.\nThe commutation relation must hold for all $t$ where both sides are defined, which is the set $D_{\\tau} = \\{t \\in \\mathbb{R} \\mid t^{2} \\ge \\tau\\}$. The condition $\\tau(2t - 1 - \\tau) = 0$ must hold for all $t \\in D_{\\tau}$.\n\nWe analyze the possible values of $\\tau$:\n1. If $\\tau < 0$, then $t^{2} \\ge \\tau$ is true for all $t \\in \\mathbb{R}$. So $D_{\\tau} = \\mathbb{R}$. The analysis is identical to Case A, which requires $\\tau = 0$. This contradicts the assumption $\\tau < 0$. No negative shifts are allowed.\n2. If $\\tau = 0$, then $t^{2} \\ge 0$ is true for all $t \\in \\mathbb{R}$. So $D_{0} = \\mathbb{R}$. The condition becomes $0 \\cdot (2t - 1 - 0) = 0$, which is true for all $t \\in \\mathbb{R}$. Thus, $\\tau=0$ is a valid solution.\n3. If $\\tau > 0$, then the domain is $D_{\\tau} = \\{t \\in \\mathbb{R} \\mid |t| \\ge \\sqrt{\\tau}\\} = (-\\infty, -\\sqrt{\\tau}] \\cup [\\sqrt{\\tau}, \\infty)$. For the condition $\\tau(2t - 1 - \\tau) = 0$ to hold for all $t \\in D_{\\tau}$ with $\\tau \\neq 0$, we must have $2t - 1 - \\tau = 0$. This implies $t = \\frac{1+\\tau}{2}$. However, the domain $D_{\\tau}$ is an infinite set containing more than one point. The equality $t = \\frac{1+\\tau}{2}$ cannot hold for all $t$ in this set. This is a contradiction.\n\nTherefore, in Case B as well, the only value of $\\tau$ for which the condition holds is $\\tau = 0$. The set of such shifts is $\\{0\\}$.\n\nFinal Determination:\nThe set of real shifts $\\tau$ for which $T \\circ S_{\\tau} = S_{\\tau} \\circ T$ holds is $\\{0\\}$ for Case A.\nThe set of real shifts $\\tau$ for which $T \\circ S_{\\tau} = S_{\\tau} \\circ T$ holds is $\\{0\\}$ for Case B.\nThe problem asks for the unique real value $\\tau^{\\star}$ that satisfies the condition in both cases.

From the set $\\left\\{ \\frac{2 \\pi k}{\\omega_{0}} \\mid k \\in \\mathbb{Z} \\right\\}$, the positive values are obtained for $k = 1, 2, 3, \\dots$. The smallest such value corresponds to $k=1$, so $\\tau_{0} = \\frac{2 \\pi}{\\omega_{0}}$.\n\nNext, we define $\\tau_{\\star} = \\frac{\\tau_{0}}{2} = \\frac{1}{2} \\left( \\frac{2 \\pi}{\\omega_{0}} \\right) = \\frac{\\pi}{\\omega_{0}}$.\n\nThe input signal is given as $x(t) = \\exp(-a t^{2})$ for $a>0$.\n\nWe compute the two terms of the commutator output $y(t)$:\nThe first term is $[T S_{\\tau_{\\star}} x](t)$.\n$$\n[S_{\\tau_{\\star}} x](t) = x(t-\\tau_{\\star}) = \\exp(-a(t-\\tau_{\\star})^{2}).\n$$\n$$\n[T S_{\\tau_{\\star}} x](t) = \\cos(\\omega_{0} t) [S_{\\tau_{\\star}} x](t) = \\cos(\\omega_{0} t) \\exp\\left(-a\\left(t - \\frac{\\pi}{\\omega_{0}}\\right)^{2}\\right).\n$$\n\nThe second term is $[S_{\\tau_{\\star}} T x](t)$.\n$$\n[T x](t) = \\cos(\\omega_{0} t) x(t) = \\cos(\\omega_{0} t) \\exp(-at^{2}).\n$$\n$$\n[S_{\\tau_{\\star}} T x](t) = [T x](t - \\tau_{\\star}) = \\cos(\\omega_{0}(t - \\tau_{\\star})) \\exp(-a(t - \\tau_{\\star})^{2}).\n$$\nSubstituting $\\tau_{\\star} = \\frac{\\pi}{\\omega_{0}}$, the trigonometric factor becomes:\n$$\n\\cos(\\omega_{0}(t - \\tau_{\\star})) = \\cos\\left(\\omega_{0}\\left(t - \\frac{\\pi}{\\omega_{0}}\\right)\\right) = \\cos(\\omega_{0} t - \\pi) = -\\cos(\\omega_{0} t).\n$$\nSo, the second term is:\n$$\n[S_{\\tau_{\\star}} T x](t) = -\\cos(\\omega_{0} t) \\exp\\left(-a\\left(t - \\frac{\\pi}{\\omega_{0}}\\right)^{2}\\right).\n$$\n\nFinally, we compute the difference $y(t)$:\n$$\ny(t) = [T S_{\\tau_{\\star}} x](t) - [S_{\\tau_{\\star}} T x](t)\n$$\n$$\ny(t) = \\left( \\cos(\\omega_{0} t) \\exp\\left(-a\\left(t - \\frac{\\pi}{\\omega_{0}}\\right)^{2}\\right) \\right) - \\left( -\\cos(\\omega_{0} t) \\exp\\left(-a\\left(t - \\frac{\\pi}{\\omega_{0}}\\right)^{2}\\right) \\right)\n$$\n$$\ny(t) = \\cos(\\omega_{0} t) \\exp\\left(-a\\left(t - \\frac{\\pi}{\\omega_{0}}\\right)^{2}\\right) + \\cos(\\omega_{0} t) \\exp\\left(-a\\left(t - \\frac{\\pi}{\\omega_{0}}\\right)^{2}\\right)\n$$\n$$\ny(t) = 2 \\cos(\\omega_{0} t) \\exp\\left(-a\\left(t - \\frac{\\pi}{\\omega_{0}}\\right)^{2}\\right).\n$$\nThis is the final closed-form expression for the commutator output.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{2 \\cos(\\omega_{0} t) \\exp\\left(-a\\left(t - \\frac{\\pi}{\\omega_{0}}\\right)^{2}\\right)}\n$$"}]}
