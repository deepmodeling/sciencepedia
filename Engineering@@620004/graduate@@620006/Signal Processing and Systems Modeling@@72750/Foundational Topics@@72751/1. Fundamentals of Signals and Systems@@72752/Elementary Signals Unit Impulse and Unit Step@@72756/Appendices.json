The derivation must first establish a general relationship between $Y(z)$ and $X(z)$, and then apply this relationship to the specific signal using a partial fraction expansion technique.\n\nFirst, we establish the general relationship between the $Z$-transform of a signal $x[n]$ and its decimated version $y[n] = x[Mn]$. The bilateral $Z$-transform of $y[n]$ is defined as:\n$$\nY(z) = \\sum_{n=-\\infty}^{\\infty} y[n] z^{-n}\n$$\nSubstituting $y[n] = x[Mn]$ into the definition, we have:\n$$\nY(z) = \\sum_{n=-\\infty}^{\\infty} x[Mn] z^{-n}\n$$\nThis sum cannot be directly related to $X(z) = \\sum_{k=-\\infty}^{\\infty} x[k] z^{-k}$ because the summation index is $n$, while the argument of $x$ is $Mn$. To proceed, we introduce an auxiliary signal $v[n]$ which is zero everywhere except at integer multiples of $M$:\n$$\nv[n] = \\begin{cases} x[n] & \\text{if } n = kM \\text{ for some integer } k \\\\ 0 & \\text{otherwise} \\end{cases}\n$$\nThe decimated signal $y[n]$ is then a compressed version of $v[n]$, specifically $y[n] = v[Mn]$. Let us find the $Z$-transform of $v[n]$, denoted $V(z)$:\n$$\nV(z) = \\sum_{n=-\\infty}^{\\infty} v[n] z^{-n} = \\sum_{k=-\\infty}^{\\infty} x[kM] z^{-kM}\n$$\nBy comparing this with the expression for $Y(z)$, we can see that:\n$$\nV(z) = \\sum_{k=-\\infty}^{\\infty} x[Mk] (z^M)^{-k} = Y(z^M)\n$$\nNow we relate $V(z)$ to $X(z)$. The signal $v[n]$ can be expressed as the product of $x[n]$ and a pulse train sequence $p[n]$ that is $1$ at multiples of $M$ and $0$ otherwise. This pulse train can be represented using the $M$-th roots of unity:\n$$\np[n] = \\frac{1}{M} \\sum_{k=0}^{M-1} (e^{j \\frac{2\\pi k}{M}})^n\n$$\nThus, $v[n] = x[n] p[n]$. The $Z$-transform $V(z)$ is then:\n$$\nV(z) = \\sum_{n=-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\left( x[n] \\left[ \\frac{1}{M} \\sum_{k=0}^{M-1} e^{j \\frac{2\\pi k n}{M}} \\right] \\right) z^{-n}\n$$\nBy swapping the order of summation, which is permissible under suitable convergence conditions:\n$$\nV(z) = \\frac{1}{M} \\sum_{k=0}^{M-1} \\left( \\sum_{n=-\\infty}^{\\infty} x[n] e^{j \\frac{2\\pi k n}{M}} z^{-n} \\right)\n$$\n$$\nV(z) = \\frac{1}{M} \\sum_{k=0}^{M-1} \\left( \\sum_{n=-\\infty}^{\\infty} x[n] (z e^{-j \\frac{2\\pi k}{M}})^{-n} \\right)\n$$\nThe inner sum is the definition of the $Z$-transform of $x[n]$ evaluated at $z e^{-j \\frac{2\\pi k}{M}}$. Therefore:\n$$\nV(z) = \\frac{1}{M} \\sum_{k=0}^{M-1} X(z e^{-j \\frac{2\\pi k}{M}})\n$$\nSince $Y(z^M) = V(z)$, we can find $Y(z)$ by replacing $z$ with $z^{1/M}$ in the expression for $V(z)$, using the principal branch for the root as specified:\n$$\nY(z) = V(z^{1/M}) = \\frac{1}{M} \\sum_{k=0}^{M-1} X(z^{1/M} e^{-j \\frac{2\\pi k}{M}})\n$$\nThis is the general expression for the $Z$-transform of a decimated signal.\n\nNext, we apply this result to the specific signal $x[n] = a^n u[n]$ with $|a|<1$. The $Z$-transform of $x[n]$ is the sum of a geometric series:\n$$\nX(z) = \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} a^n z^{-n} = \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} (az^{-1})^n = \\frac{1}{1 - az^{-1}}\n$$\nThis transform converges for $|az^{-1}| < 1$, i.e., in the region of convergence (ROC) $|z|>|a|$.\n\nNow we substitute this expression for $X(z)$ into the formula for $Y(z)$. Let $w_k = z^{1/M} e^{-j \\frac{2\\pi k}{M}}$. Then $Y(z) = \\frac{1}{M} \\sum_{k=0}^{M-1} X(w_k)$.\n$$\nX(w_k) = \\frac{1}{1 - a w_k^{-1}} = \\frac{1}{1 - a (z^{1/M} e^{-j \\frac{2\\pi k}{M}})^{-1}} = \\frac{1}{1 - a z^{-1/M} e^{j \\frac{2\\pi k}{M}}}\n$$\nSo, $Y(z)$ becomes:\n$$\nY(z) = \\frac{1}{M} \\sum_{k=0}^{M-1} \\frac{1}{1 - a z^{-1/M} e^{j \\frac{2\\pi k}{M}}}\n$$\nTo simplify this sum as instructed, we use a result from complex analysis related to partial fraction expansion. Let $c = a z^{-1/M}$ and $\\omega_k = e^{j \\frac{2\\pi k}{M}}$ for $k=0, 1, \\dots, M-1$. The sum is $\\sum_{k=0}^{M-1} \\frac{1}{1 - c \\omega_k}$.\nConsider the polynomial $P(s) = s^M - c^M$. Its roots are $s_k = c \\omega_k$ for $k=0, \\dots, M-1$.\nWe can write the partial fraction expansion of the rational function $\\frac{g(s)}{P(s)}$. A useful identity arises from considering $g(s) = M s^{M-1}$:\n$$\n\\frac{M s^{M-1}}{s^M - c^M} = \\sum_{k=0}^{M-1} \\frac{A_k}{s - c \\omega_k}\n$$\nThe coefficients $A_k$ are the residues at the simple poles $s_k$. Using the formula $A_k = \\frac{g(s_k)}{P'(s_k)}$:\n$$\nA_k = \\frac{M s^{M-1}}{\\frac{d}{ds}(s^M - c^M)} \\bigg|_{s=c\\omega_k} = \\frac{M s^{M-1}}{M s^{M-1}} \\bigg|_{s=c\\omega_k} = 1\n$$\nAll coefficients are $A_k = 1$. Thus, we have the identity:\n$$\n\\frac{M s^{M-1}}{s^M - c^M} = \\sum_{k=0}^{M-1} \\frac{1}{s - c \\omega_k}\n$$\nTo match the form of our sum, we can manipulate this identity. Let us set $s=1$:\n$$\n\\frac{M}{1 - c^M} = \\sum_{k=0}^{M-1} \\frac{1}{1 - c \\omega_k}\n$$\nThis expression is exactly the sum we need to evaluate, multiplied by $M$. Therefore:\n$$\n\\sum_{k=0}^{M-1} \\frac{1}{1 - c \\omega_k} = \\frac{M}{1 - c^M}\n$$\nSubstituting this back into the expression for $Y(z)$:\n$$\nY(z) = \\frac{1}{M} \\left( \\frac{M}{1 - c^M} \\right) = \\frac{1}{1 - c^M}\n$$\nFinally, we substitute back $c = a z^{-1/M}$:\n$$\nc^M = (a z^{-1/M})^M = a^M (z^{-1/M})^M = a^M z^{-1}\n$$\nThis gives the closed-form expression for $Y(z)$:\n$$\nY(z) = \\frac{1}{1 - a^M z^{-1}}\n$$\nThis result is consistent with the direct calculation of the $Z$-transform of $y[n] = x[Mn] = a^{Mn}u[Mn] = (a^M)^n u[n]$, which is a geometric sequence with ratio $a^M$. The ROC is $|z| > |a^M|$. Since $|a|<1$ and $M \\geq 2$, we have $|a^M| < |a|$, so the ROC of $Y(z)$ is larger than that of $X(z)$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\frac{1}{1 - a^{M} z^{-1}}}\n$$", "id": "2863301"}, {"introduction": "Having established how decimation causes spectral aliasing, we now turn to a critical engineering application: preventing it.

The derivation must be based on the frequency-domain characterization of the downsampling operation.\n\nLet the complex-valued signal at the output of the anti-aliasing filter be denoted by $x_f[n]$. Its discrete-time Fourier transform (DTFT) is $X_f(\\exp(j\\omega))$. According to the problem statement, this signal is generated by passing a baseband signal $v[n]$ through a low-pass filter. The spectrum of $v[n]$, $V(\\exp(j\\omega))$, has essential support on the interval $[-\\Delta, \\Delta]$. The filter has a magnitude response $|H(\\exp(j\\omega))|$ that is specified to be zero for all frequencies $|\\omega| \\ge \\Delta+\\Delta\\omega$. The output spectrum is $X_f(\\exp(j\\omega)) = H(\\exp(j\\omega))V(\\exp(j\\omega))$. Due to the filter characteristic, the spectrum of the filtered signal $x_f[n]$ is strictly zero for $|\\omega| \\ge \\Delta+\\Delta\\omega$. Therefore, the spectral support of $x_f[n]$ is contained entirely within the open interval $(-\\omega_{max}, \\omega_{max})$, where we define the maximum frequency as $\\omega_{max} = \\Delta+\\Delta\\omega$.\n\nThe signal $x_f[n]$ is then downsampled by an integer factor $M \\ge 1$ to produce the signal $y[n] = x_f[Mn]$. The problem requires using the defining frequency-domain characterization of this operation. The DTFT of the downsampled signal, $Y(\\exp(j\\omega))$, is related to the DTFT of the original signal, $X_f(\\exp(j\\omega))$, by the following expression:\n$$\nY(\\exp(j\\omega)) = \\frac{1}{M} \\sum_{k=0}^{M-1} X_f\\left(\\exp\\left(j\\frac{\\omega - 2\\pi k}{M}\\right)\\right)\n$$\nThis equation represents the spectrum of the downsampled signal as a superposition of $M$ frequency-scaled and shifted copies of the original spectrum.\n\nSpectral aliasing occurs if, for any frequency $\\omega$ in the principal interval $[-\\pi, \\pi]$, more than one term in the summation is non-zero.
