A full analysis will be performed.\n\n**System Analysis**\n\nThe system $S$ is defined by the input-output relationship:\n$$ y(t) = (Sx)(t) = x(t-1) + x(t+1) $$\nWe will examine the properties of linearity, memory, and time invariance based on their foundational definitions.\n\n**1. Linearity**\nA system $S$ is linear if and only if it satisfies both the additivity and homogeneity properties.\nLet $x_1(t)$ and $x_2(t)$ be two arbitrary input signals in $C(\\mathbb{R})$, and let $a \\in \\mathbb{R}$ be an arbitrary scalar.\n\n- **Additivity:** We must check if $S(x_1 + x_2) = S(x_1) + S(x_2)$.\nLet's compute the output for the input $(x_1 + x_2)(t) = x_1(t) + x_2(t)$:\n$$ (S(x_1 + x_2))(t) = (x_1 + x_2)(t-1) + (x_1 + x_2)(t+1) $$\nBy the definition of function addition:\n$$ (S(x_1 + x_2))(t) = [x_1(t-1) + x_2(t-1)] + [x_1(t+1) + x_2(t+1)] $$\nRearranging the terms:\n$$ (S(x_1 + x_2))(t) = [x_1(t-1) + x_1(t+1)] + [x_2(t-1) + x_2(t+1)] $$\nWe recognize that the terms in the brackets are the outputs for $x_1$ and $x_2$ individually:\n$$ (S(x_1 + x_2))(t) = (Sx_1)(t) + (Sx_2)(t) $$\nSince this holds for all $t \\in \\mathbb{R}$, we have $S(x_1 + x_2) = S(x_1) + S(x_2)$.

The homogeneity property is satisfied.\n\nSince both additivity and homogeneity are satisfied, the system $S$ is **linear**.\n\n**2. Memory**\nA system is memoryless if its output $y(t)$ at any time $t_0$ depends only on the input value $x(t_0)$ at that same time. Otherwise, the system has memory.\n\nThe output of the system is given by:\n$$ y(t) = (Sx)(t) = x(t-1) + x(t+1) $$\nTo calculate the output $y(t_0)$ at a specific time $t_0$, we need to know the input values $x(t_0-1)$ and $x(t_0+1)$. These are values of the input at a past time ($t_0-1$) and a future time ($t_0+1$). Since the output depends on input values at times other than the present time $t_0$, the system is not memoryless.\n\nTherefore, the system $S$ **has memory**.\n\n**3. Time Invariance**\nA system $S$ is time-invariant if a time shift in the input signal results in an identical time shift in the output signal. Formally, let $T_\\tau$ be the operator that shifts a signal by $\\tau$, i.e., $(T_\\tau x)(t) = x(t-\\tau)$. A system $S$ is time-invariant if it commutes with $T_\\tau$ for any $\\tau \\in \\mathbb{R}$, which is to say $S T_\\tau = T_\\tau S$. We must verify if $(S(T_\\tau x))(t) = (T_\\tau(Sx))(t)$ for all $t$ and $\\tau$.\n\n- First, we find the output of the system for a shifted input, $x_\\tau(t) = (T_\\tau x)(t) = x(t-\\tau)$.\n$$ (S(T_\\tau x))(t) = (S x_\\tau)(t) = x_\\tau(t-1) + x_\\tau(t+1) $$\nSubstituting the definition of $x_\\tau(t)$:\n$$ (S(T_\\tau x))(t) = x((t-1)-\\tau) + x((t+1)-\\tau) = x(t-\\tau-1) + x(t-\\tau+1) $$\n\n- Second, we find the shifted version of the original output. Let $y(t) = (Sx)(t) = x(t-1) + x(t+1)$.\n$$ (T_\\tau(Sx))(t) = (T_\\tau y)(t) = y(t-\\tau) $$\nSubstituting the definition of $y(t)$:\n$$ (T_\\tau(Sx))(t) = x((t-\\tau)-1) + x((t-\\tau)+1) = x(t-\\tau-1) + x(t-\\tau+1) $$\n\nComparing the two results, we see that $(S(T_\\tau x))(t) = (T_\\tau(Sx))(t)$ for all $t, \\tau \\in \\mathbb{R}$. The system's operation commutes with the time-shift operation.\n\nTherefore, the system $S$ is **time-invariant**.\n\n**Conclusion Summary**\n- The system $S$ is **linear**.\n- The system $S$ **has memory**.\n- The system $S$ is **time-invariant**.\n\n**Option Evaluation**\n\nA. $S$ is nonlinear, memoryless, and time-invariant.\n**Incorrect.** Our analysis shows that $S$ is linear and has memory.\n\nB. $S$ is linear, has memory, and is time-invariant.\n**Correct.** This classification matches our derived properties precisely.\n\nC. $S$ is linear, memoryless, and time-varying.\n**Incorrect.** Our analysis shows that $S$ has memory and is time-invariant.\n\nD. $S$ is nonlinear, has memory, and is time-varying.\n**Incorrect.** Our analysis shows that $S$ is linear and time-invariant.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2909796"}, {"introduction": "Having established the properties of a linear system, we now turn to one incorporating a nonlinear operation.

The problem is self-contained and free of contradictions or logical flaws.\n\n**Verdict:** The problem is valid. We proceed to the solution.\n\nThe problem requires a two-part analysis of the discrete-time operator $T$ defined by $y[n]=T\\{x\\}[n]=\\max\\{x[n],x[n-1]\\}$.\n\n**Part 1: Time-Invariance and Memory**\n\nFirst, we assess whether the system has memory. The definition states a system is memoryless if the output $y[n]$ at any time $n$ depends only on the input $x[n]$ at that same time $n$. The given system is $y[n] = \\max\\{x[n], x[n-1]\\}$. The output $y[n]$ depends on the current input sample $x[n]$ and the previous input sample $x[n-1]$. Since the output is dependent on an input value at a time other than $n$, the system is **not memoryless**; it has memory.\n\nNext, we assess time-invariance. A system is time-invariant if a shift in the input signal results in an identical shift in the output signal. Let $x_{s}[n]=x[n-n_{d}]$ be an arbitrarily shifted input, where $n_{d}$ is an integer delay. The output corresponding to this input is:\n$$y_{s}[n] = T\\{x_{s}\\}[n] = \\max\\{x_{s}[n], x_{s}[n-1]\\} = \\max\\{x[n-n_{d}], x[n-1-n_{d}]\\}$$\nNow, we consider the original output, $y[n] = \\max\\{x[n], x[n-1]\\}$, and shift it by $n_{d}$:\n$$y[n-n_{d}] = \\max\\{x[n-n_{d}], x[(n-n_{d})-1]\\} = \\max\\{x[n-n_{d}], x[n-n_{d}-1]\\}$$\nBy direct comparison, we find that $y_{s}[n] = y[n-n_{d}]$ for all possible inputs $x[n]$ and all integer shifts $n_{d}$. Therefore, the system is **time-invariant**.\n\n**Part 2: Nonlinearity and Computation of $\\Delta$**\n\nA system is linear if it satisfies the superposition principle, which comprises additivity ($T\\{x_{1}+x_{2}\\} = T\\{x_{1}\\} + T\\{x_{2}\\}$) and homogeneity ($T\\{\\alpha x\\} = \\alpha T\\{x\\}$). The problem asks to demonstrate a failure of linearity by computing the discrepancy $\\Delta$, which is structured to test the additivity property. If $\\Delta \\neq 0$, the additivity property fails, and the system is nonlinear.\n\nWe are given the specific inputs:\n- $x_{1}[n]$ is a unit impulse at $n=0$: $x_{1}[0]=1$ and $x_{1}[n]=0$ for $n \\neq 0$.\n- $x_{2}[n]$ is a unit impulse at $n=-1$: $x_{2}[-1]=1$ and $x_{2}[n]=0$ for $n \\neq -1$.\n\nThe evaluation is to be performed at the time index $n_{0}=0$.\n\nLet us compute the three terms required for $\\Delta$.\n\n1.

At $n_{0}=0$, this becomes:\n    $$T\\{x_{1}\\}[0] = y_{1}[0] = \\max\\{x_{1}[0], x_{1}[-1]\\}$$\n    Using the definition of $x_{1}[n]$, we have $x_{1}[0]=1$ and $x_{1}[-1]=0$.\n    $$T\\{x_{1}\\}[0] = \\max\\{1, 0\\} = 1$$\n\n2.  Compute $T\\{x_{2}\\}[n_{0}]$:\n    The output for input $x_{2}[n]$ is $y_{2}[n] = \\max\\{x_{2}[n], x_{2}[n-1]\\}$.

Compute $T\\{x_{1}+x_{2}\\}[n_{0}]$:\n    First, construct the sum of the inputs, let $x_{3}[n] = x_{1}[n] + x_{2}[n]$. This combined signal is:\n    $$x_{3}[n] = \\begin{cases} 1 & \\text{if } n=0 \\text{ or } n=-1 \\\\ 0 & \\text{otherwise} \\end{cases}$$\n    The output for this input is $y_{3}[n] = \\max\\{x_{3}[n], x_{3}[n-1]\\}$.

There are no subjective or ambiguous terms.\n\nStep 3: Verdict and Action.\nThe problem is deemed valid. A full solution will be provided.\n\nA system, represented by an operator $S$, is linear if it satisfies two properties for any admissible inputs $x_1$ and $x_2$ and any scalar $c \\in \\mathbb{R}$:\n1. Additivity: $S[x_1 + x_2] = S[x_1] + S[x_2]$.\n2. Homogeneity: $S[c x_1] = c S[x_1]$.\n\nFor the given operator $S[x](t) = Q_{\\Delta}(x(t))$, these conditions must hold for all $t \\in \\mathbb{R}$. The conditions on the function $Q_{\\Delta}$ are:\n1. Additivity: $Q_{\\Delta}(a+b) = Q_{\\Delta}(a) + Q_{\\Delta}(b)$ for all $a, b \\in \\mathbb{R}$.\n2. Homogeneity: $Q_{\\Delta}(ca) = c Q_{\\Delta}(a)$ for all $c, a \\in \\mathbb{R}$.\n\nTo prove that $S$ is not linear, it is sufficient to provide a single counterexample demonstrating the failure of either property. We will test for additivity.\nLet us choose two constant signals, $x_1(t) = 0.3 \\Delta$ and $x_2(t) = 0.3 \\Delta$.\nFirst, we evaluate the output for each signal individually and sum the results:\n$S[x_1](t) = Q_{\\Delta}(0.3 \\Delta) = \\Delta R(\\frac{0.3 \\Delta}{\\Delta}) = \\Delta R(0.3) = \\Delta \\lfloor 0.3 + 0.5 \\rfloor = \\Delta \\lfloor 0.8 \\rfloor = \\Delta \\cdot 0 = 0$.\n$S[x_2](t) = Q_{\\Delta}(0.3 \\Delta) = 0$.\nThe sum of the outputs is $S[x_1](t) + S[x_2](t) = 0 + 0 = 0$.\n\nNext, we evaluate the output for the sum of the signals:\n$x_1(t) + x_2(t) = 0.3 \\Delta + 0.3 \\Delta = 0.6 \\Delta$.\n$S[x_1+x_2](t) = Q_{\\Delta}(0.6 \\Delta) = \\Delta R(\\frac{0.6 \\Delta}{\\Delta}) = \\Delta R(0.6) = \\Delta \\lfloor 0.6 + 0.5 \\rfloor = \\Delta \\lfloor 1.1 \\rfloor = \\Delta \\cdot 1 = \\Delta$.\n\nWe see that $S[x_1+x_2](t) = \\Delta$ while $S[x_1](t) + S[x_2](t) = 0$. Since $\\Delta > 0$, we have $\\Delta \\neq 0$. Therefore, $S[x_1+x_2] \\neq S[x_1] + S[x_2]$. The additivity property fails. This single counterexample is sufficient to conclude that the operator $S$ is not linear.\n\nNow, we address the second part of the problem. We must find the smallest constant $C$ such that $|E(t)| \\leq C$ for all $t$ and all bounded inputs $x_1, x_2$. This constant $C$ is the supremum of $|E(t)|$ over all possible inputs and time.\n$$C = \\sup_{t, x_1, x_2} |E(t)| = \\sup_{t, x_1, x_2} |Q_{\\Delta}(x_1(t)+x_2(t)) - Q_{\\Delta}(x_1(t)) - Q_{\\Delta}(x_2(t))|$$\nSince the operator $Q_{\\Delta}$ is memoryless (i.e., its output at time $t$ depends only on the input at time $t$), the problem is equivalent to finding the supremum over all possible instantaneous values of the signals. Let $u = x_1(t)$ and $v = x_2(t)$. We seek:\n$$C = \\sup_{u, v \\in \\mathbb{R}} |Q_{\\Delta}(u+v) - Q_{\\Delta}(u) - Q_{\\Delta}(v)|$$\nUsing the definition of $Q_{\\Delta}$, we have:\n$$C = \\sup_{u, v \\in \\mathbb{R}} |\\Delta R\\left(\\frac{u+v}{\\Delta}\\right) - \\Delta R\\left(\\frac{u}{\\Delta}\\right) - \\Delta R\\left(\\frac{v}{\\Delta}\\right)|$$\n$$C = \\Delta \\sup_{u, v \\in \\mathbb{R}} |R\\left(\\frac{u+v}{\\Delta}\\right) - R\\left(\\frac{u}{\\Delta}\\right) - R\\left(\\frac{v}{\\Delta}\\right)|$$\nLet $u' = u/\\Delta$ and $v' = v/\\Delta$. The problem reduces to finding the supremum of the magnitude of the function $f(u', v') = R(u'+v') - R(u') - R(v')$.\n$$f(u',v') = \\left\\lfloor (u'+v') + \\frac{1}{2}\\right\\rfloor - \\left\\lfloor u' + \\frac{1}{2}\\right\\rfloor - \\left\\lfloor v' + \\frac{1}{2}\\right\\rfloor$$\nLet $X = u' + 1/2$ and $Y = v' + 1/2$. The expression transforms to:\n$$f(u',v') = \\left\\lfloor X+Y-\\frac{1}{2} \\right\\rfloor - \\lfloor X \\rfloor - \\lfloor Y \\rfloor$$\nWe can express any real number $z$ as the sum of its integer part, $\\lfloor z \\rfloor$, and its fractional part, $\\{z\\}$, where $0 \\le \\{z\\}  1$. So, let $X = \\lfloor X \\rfloor + \\{X\\}$ and $Y = \\lfloor Y \\rfloor + \\{Y\\}$.\nSubstituting this into the expression for $f(u',v')$:\n$$f(u',v') = \\left\\lfloor (\\lfloor X \\rfloor + \\{X\\}) + (\\lfloor Y \\rfloor + \\{Y\\}) - \\frac{1}{2} \\right\\rfloor - \\lfloor X \\rfloor - \\lfloor Y \\rfloor$$\nSince $\\lfloor X \\rfloor$ and $\\lfloor Y \\rfloor$ are integers, they can be factored out of the outer floor function:\n$$f(u',v') = \\lfloor X \\rfloor + \\lfloor Y \\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\{X\\} + \\{Y\\} - \\frac{1}{2} \\right\\rfloor - \\lfloor X \\rfloor - \\lfloor Y \\rfloor$$\n$$f(u',v') = \\left\\lfloor \\{X\\} + \\{Y\\} - \\frac{1}{2} \\right\\rfloor$$\nThe fractional parts $\\{X\\}$ and $\\{Y\\}$ are restricted to the interval $[0, 1)$. Thus, their sum $\\{X\\} + \\{Y\\}$ is in the interval $[0, 2)$.\nConsequently, the argument of the floor function, $\\{X\\} + \\{Y\\} - 1/2$, is in the interval $[-1/2, 3/2)$.\nThe possible integer values for $\\lfloor z \\rfloor$ where $z \\in [-1/2, 3/2)$ are $-1$, $0$, and $1$.\n- To obtain $f(u',v') = 1$, we need $1 \\le \\{X\\} + \\{Y\\} - 1/2  3/2$, which means $3/2 \\le \\{X\\} + \\{Y\\}  2$. For example, choose $\\{X\\} = 0.8$ and $\\{Y\\} = 0.8$. This corresponds to $u' = 0.3$ and $v' = 0.3$. Our initial counterexample already showed that for these values, the error $E(t)$ is $\\Delta$, so $f(0.3, 0.3) = 1$.\n- To obtain $f(u',v') = -1$, we need $-1/2 \\le \\{X\\} + \\{Y\\} - 1/2  0$, which means $0 \\le \\{X\\} + \\{Y\\}  1/2$. For example, choose $\\{X\\} = 0.2$ and $\\{Y\\} = 0.2$. This corresponds to $X = 0.2$ and $Y = 0.2$, so $u' = X - 1/2 = -0.3$ and $v' = Y - 1/2 = -0.3$. Let's test this.\n$Q_{\\Delta}(-0.3\\Delta) = \\Delta R(-0.3) = \\Delta\\lfloor-0.3+0.5\\rfloor = \\Delta\\lfloor0.2\\rfloor=0$.\n$Q_{\\Delta}(-0.3\\Delta) + Q_{\\Delta}(-0.3\\Delta) = 0$.\n$Q_{\\Delta}(-0.3\\Delta - 0.3\\Delta) = Q_{\\Delta}(-0.6\\Delta) = \\Delta R(-0.6) = \\Delta\\lfloor-0.6+0.5\\rfloor = \\Delta\\lfloor-0.1\\rfloor = -\\Delta$.\nThe error is $E = -\\Delta - 0 = -\\Delta$, so $f(-0.3, -0.3) = -1$.\n- To obtain $f(u',v') = 0$, we need $0 \\le \\{X\\} + \\{Y\\} - 1/2  1$, which means $1/2 \\le \\{X\\} + \\{Y\\}  3/2$.\n\nSince the function $f(u', v')$ can take the values $-1$ and $1$, the supremum of its absolute value is:\n$$\\sup_{u', v' \\in \\mathbb{R}} |f(u',v')| = \\sup |\\{-1, 0, 1\\}| = 1$$\nFinally, we substitute this back into the expression for $C$:\n$$C = \\Delta \\sup_{u', v' \\in \\mathbb{R}} |f(u',v')| = \\Delta \\cdot 1 = \\Delta$$\nThe smallest constant $C$ such that $|E(t)|\\leq C$ is $\\Delta$.", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{\\Delta} $$", "id": "2909780"}]}
