It is well-posed, as the convolution of two piecewise-constant functions with finite support is a well-defined operation leading to a unique and continuous function. The problem is objective and contains no ambiguities or contradictions. All necessary information is provided. Thus, the problem is deemed valid and a solution will be presented.\n\nThe convolution integral is defined as:\n$$y(t) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} x(\\tau) h(t-\\tau) \\,d\\tau$$\nThe functions $x(t)$ and $h(t)$ are rectangular pulses. Specifically:\n- $x(t)$ is a rectangular pulse of height $1$ for $t \\in [0, 1]$, and $0$ otherwise.\n- $h(t)$ is a rectangular pulse of height $1$ for $t \\in [0, 2]$, and $0$ otherwise.\n\nFor the graphical method, we plot $x(\\tau)$ and $h(t-\\tau)$ as functions of the integration variable $\\tau$. The function $x(\\tau)$ is fixed. The function $h(t-\\tau)$ is obtained by first time-reversing $h(\\tau)$ to get $h(-\\tau)$, which is a pulse from $\\tau = -2$ to $\\tau = 0$, and then shifting it by $t$. Thus, $h(t-\\tau)$ is a rectangular pulse of height $1$ over the interval $\\tau \\in [t-2, t]$.\n\nThe value of the convolution integral $y(t)$ is the area of the overlapping region between $x(\\tau)$ and $h(t-\\tau)$ for a given value of $t$. We analyze the problem by considering different intervals for $t$, which correspond to different types of overlap. The integrand, $x(\\tau)h(t-\\tau)$, is equal to $1$ where the supports of the two pulses overlap, and $0$ otherwise. The support of $x(\\tau)$ is $[0, 1]$.\n\nCase 1: $t < 0$\nThe right edge of the sliding pulse $h(t-\\tau)$ is at $\\tau = t$.

The left edge, $\\tau=t-2$, is still to the left of the fixed pulse's right edge, i.e., $t-2 < 1$. This corresponds to the fixed pulse $x(\\tau)$ being fully contained within the support of the sliding pulse $h(t-\\tau)$. The overlap region is the entire support of $x(\\tau)$, which is from $\\tau=0$ to $\\tau=1$.\nThe integral is:\n$$y(t) = \\int_{0}^{1} (1)(1) \\,d\\tau = [\\tau]_{0}^{1} = 1 - 0 = 1$$\n\nCase 4: $2 \\le t < 3$\nThe left edge of $h(t-\\tau)$, $\\tau=t-2$, has entered the support of $x(\\tau)$ (i.e., $t-2 \\ge 0$), while the right edge $\\tau=t$ is far to the right of $x(\\tau)$'s support. The sliding pulse is moving away from the fixed pulse. This interval ends when the left edge of $h(t-\\tau)$ passes the right edge of $x(\\tau)$, i.e., when $t-2 = 1$, or $t=3$. So, this case is for $2 \\le t < 3$. The overlap region is from $\\tau = t-2$ to $\\tau = 1$.\nThe integral is:\n$$y(t) = \\int_{t-2}^{1} (1)(1) \\,d\\tau = [\\tau]_{t-2}^{1} = 1 - (t-2) = 3 - t$$\n\nCase 5: $t \\ge 3$\nThe left edge of the sliding pulse $h(t-\\tau)$, $\\tau=t-2$, has moved past the right edge of the fixed pulse $x(\\tau)$, i.e., $t-2 \\ge 1$. There is no overlap.\n$$y(t) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} 0 \\,d\\tau = 0$$\n\nCombining these results, we can express the output $y(t)$ as a single piecewise-defined function:\n$$y(t) = \\begin{cases} 0 & \\text{for } t < 0 \\\\ t & \\text{for } 0 \\le t < 1 \\\\ 1 & \\text{for } 1 \\le t < 2 \\\\ 3-t & \\text{for } 2 \\le t < 3 \\\\ 0 & \\text{for } t \\ge 3 \\end{cases}$$\nThis result describes a trapezoidal pulse that starts at $t=0$, rises linearly to a value of $1$ at $t=1$, stays constant at $1$ until $t=2$, decreases linearly to $0$ at $t=3$, and is zero elsewhere.

The problem statement correctly defines the bilateral Laplace transform as $H(s) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} h(t)\\exp(-st)dt$.\n\nFirst, we validate the problem statement.\nThe givens are:\n1.  System type: single-input single-output (SISO), continuous-time, linear time-invariant (LTI).\n2.  Initial conditions: zero. This is a standard assumption for transfer function analysis.\n3.  Transfer function: $H(s)=\\frac{3s+5}{(s+1)(s+2)}$.\n4.  Constraint: The system is causal. This is the critical piece of information for determining the impulse response uniquely.\n5.  Methodology: The solution must use the relationship between causality and the ROC, employ partial fraction decomposition, and perform term-by-term inversion of the Laplace transform.\n\nThe problem is scientifically grounded in the theory of signals and systems. It is well-posed, objective, and contains no contradictions or missing information. The request to derive $h(t)$ for a causal system from $H(s)$ is a standard, fundamental problem in this domain. Thus, the problem is valid. We proceed with the solution.\n\nThe poles of the transfer function $H(s)$ are the values of $s$ for which the denominator is zero. The denominator is $(s+1)(s+2)$, so the poles are $s_1 = -1$ and $s_2 = -2$.\n\nA fundamental property of the Laplace transform is that for a causal system, where the impulse response $h(t)$ is zero for all $t < 0$, the region of convergence (ROC) of its Laplace transform $H(s)$ must be a right-half plane. Specifically, the ROC is given by $\\text{Re}(s) > \\sigma_{\\max}$, where $\\sigma_{\\max}$ is the real part of the rightmost pole of $H(s)$.\n\nIn our case, the poles are at $s_1 = -1$ and $s_2 = -2$. The real parts are $\\text{Re}(s_1) = -1$ and $\\text{Re}(s_2) = -2$. The rightmost pole is $s_1 = -1$, as $-1 > -2$. Therefore, the ROC consistent with a causal system is $\\text{Re}(s) > -1$.\n\nNext, we perform a partial fraction expansion of $H(s)$. We express $H(s)$ as a sum of simpler rational functions:\n$$\nH(s) = \\frac{3s+5}{(s+1)(s+2)} = \\frac{A}{s+1} + \\frac{B}{s+2}\n$$\nTo find the coefficient $A$, we use the residue method:\n$$\nA = \\lim_{s \\to -1} (s+1)H(s) = \\lim_{s \\to -1} \\frac{3s+5}{s+2} = \\frac{3(-1)+5}{-1+2} = \\frac{-3+5}{1} = 2\n$$\nTo find the coefficient $B$:\n$$\nB = \\lim_{s \\to -2} (s+2)H(s) = \\lim_{s \\to -2} \\frac{3s+5}{s+1} = \\frac{3(-2)+5}{-2+1} = \\frac{-6+5}{-1} = 1\n$$\nThus, the partial fraction expansion of the transfer function is:\n$$\nH(s) = \\frac{2}{s+1} + \\frac{1}{s+2}\n$$\nNow we must find the inverse Laplace transform of each term. We use the standard Laplace transform pair:\n$$\n\\mathcal{L}^{-1}\\left\\{\\frac{1}{s-a}\\right\\} = \\exp(at)u(t) \\quad \\text{for ROC } \\text{Re}(s) > \\text{Re}(a)\n$$\nwhere $u(t)$ is the Heaviside unit step function, defined as $u(t) = 1$ for $t \\ge 0$ and $u(t) = 0$ for $t < 0$. This transform pair corresponds to a right-sided, or causal, signal.\n\nFor the first term, $\\frac{2}{s+1} = \\frac{2}{s-(-1)}$, we have $a = -1$. The ROC for its causal inverse transform is $\\text{Re}(s) > -1$. This is consistent with the overall ROC of $H(s)$. The inverse transform is:\n$$\n\\mathcal{L}^{-1}\\left\\{\\frac{2}{s+1}\\right\\} = 2\\exp(-t)u(t)\n$$\nFor the second term, $\\frac{1}{s+2} = \\frac{1}{s-(-2)}$, we have $a = -2$. The ROC for its causal inverse transform is $\\text{Re}(s) > -2$. The overall ROC, $\\text{Re}(s) > -1$, is a subset of this region, so the causal inverse is also appropriate here. The inverse transform is:\n$$\n\\mathcal{L}^{-1}\\left\\{\\frac{1}{s+2}\\right\\} = \\exp(-2t)u(t)\n$$\nBy the linearity of the Laplace transform, the impulse response $h(t)$ is the sum of these individual inverse transforms:\n$$\nh(t) = 2\\exp(-t)u(t) + \\exp(-2t)u(t)\n$$\nThis can be written as:\n$$\nh(t) = (2\\exp(-t) + \\exp(-2t))u(t)\n$$\nThe problem asks for an explicit expression for $h(t)$ that is valid for $t \\ge 0$.

A systematic method is to use the controllable canonical form. The transfer function is strictly proper, as the degree of the numerator polynomial ($1$) is less than the degree of the denominator polynomial ($3$), which implies that the direct feedthrough matrix $D$ is zero, as required ($D=0$). The denominator polynomial is $s^3 + a_2 s^2 + a_1 s + a_0$ with $a_2=4$, $a_1=9$, $a_0=10$.

The minimal possible dimension for a state-space realization of $G(s)$ is therefore $3$.\n\nThe McMillan degree of a transfer function is defined as the dimension of any of its minimal state-space realizations. Consequently, the McMillan degree of the given $G(s)$ is $3$.\n\nThis conclusion is confirmed by examining the pole-zero structure of $G(s)$ itself.
