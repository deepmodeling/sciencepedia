The series of squared absolute values must converge: $\\sum_{n=-\\infty}^{\\infty} |x[n]|^2  \\infty$.\n\nWe shall construct such a sequence and then rigorously prove that it satisfies these two conditions. The construction is guided by the well-known convergence properties of p-series, $\\sum_{k=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{k^p}$, which converge for $p  1$ and diverge for $p \\le 1$. We seek a sequence where $|x[n]|$ behaves like $\\frac{1}{|n|^a}$. For absolute summability to fail, we must have $a \\le 1$.

The most straightforward choice is $a=1$.\n\nBased on this reasoning, we propose the following sequence:\n$$x[n] = \\begin{cases} \\frac{1}{n}  \\text{if } n \\neq 0 \\\\ 0  \\text{if } n = 0 \\end{cases}$$\nThe definition sets $x[0]=0$ to avoid the singularity at $n=0$, which is a necessary and trivial step. We now proceed to verify the two required properties for this sequence.\n\nFirst, we prove that the sequence $x[n]$ is not absolutely summable. We must evaluate the series $\\sum_{n=-\\infty}^{\\infty} |x[n]|$.

By the binomial theorem, this is the expansion of $(E-1)^4$.\nTherefore, the characteristic polynomial factors as $P(E) = (E-1)^4$. The equation to solve is $(E-1)^4 x[n] = 0$. This reveals a single characteristic root $r=1$ with multiplicity $m=4$.\n\nWe must now derive the general form of the solution for an LCCDE with a characteristic root $r$ of multiplicity $m$, i.e., $(E-r)^m x[n] = 0$.\n\nThe fundamental eigen-sequence property states that a sequence of the form $x[n] = r^n$ is a solution to $(E-r)x[n]=0$. This is verified directly:\n$$(E-r)r^n = E\\{r^n\\} - r \\cdot r^n = r^{n+1} - r^{n+1} = 0$$\nThis is the solution corresponding to a root of multiplicity $m=1$.\n\nFor a root with multiplicity $m  1$, we must investigate the action of the operator $(E-r)$ on sequences of the form $n^k r^n$. Let us examine the case of $(E-r)^m x[n] = 0$. We will show that the sequences $r^n, n r^n, \\dots, n^{m-1} r^n$ form a basis for the solution space.\n\nConsider the action of the operator $(E-r)$ on the sequence $x[n] = n^k r^n$:\n$$(E-r)\\{n^k r^n\\} = E\\{n^k r^n\\} - r \\cdot n^k r^n = (n+1)^k r^{n+1} - r n^k r^n$$\nFactoring out $r^{n+1}$:\n$$(E-r)\\{n^k r^n\\} = r^{n+1} \\left( (n+1)^k - n^k \\right)$$\nUsing the binomial expansion for $(n+1)^k$:\n$$(n+1)^k - n^k = \\left( \\sum_{j=0}^{k} \\binom{k}{j} n^j \\right) - n^k = \\left( n^k + k n^{k-1} + \\binom{k}{2} n^{k-2} + \\dots + 1 \\right) - n^k$$\n$$= k n^{k-1} + \\binom{k}{2} n^{k-2} + \\dots + 1$$\nThis resulting expression is a polynomial in $n$ of degree $k-1$. Let us denote this polynomial as $Q_{k-1}(n)$.\nSo, $(E-r)\\{n^k r^n\\} = r^{n+1} Q_{k-1}(n)$. This can be rewritten as $r \\cdot (r^n Q_{k-1}(n))$.\n\nThis shows that applying $(E-r)$ to $n^k r^n$ lowers the degree of the polynomial factor by one. Let us apply the operator $(E-r)$ repeatedly.\n$$(E-r)^2 \\{n^k r^n\\} = (E-r) \\{r^{n+1} Q_{k-1}(n)\\} = r(E-r)\\{r^n Q_{k-1}(n)\\}$$\nThe term $(E-r)\\{r^n Q_{k-1}(n)\\}$ will, by the same logic, produce $r^{n+1}$ times a polynomial of degree $k-2$.\nSo, $(E-r)^2 \\{n^k r^n\\} = r \\cdot r^{n+1} Q_{k-2}(n) = r^2 (r^n Q_{k-2}(n))$.\nBy induction, applying the operator $(E-r)$ a total of $k$ times will result in a polynomial of degree $k-k=0$, which is a constant.\n$$(E-r)^k \\{n^k r^n\\} = C \\cdot r^{n+k} = C' \\cdot r^n$$ for some non-zero constant $C'$.\nNow, we apply the operator one more time, for a total of $k+1$ applications:\n$$(E-r)^{k+1} \\{n^k r^n\\} = (E-r) \\{C' r^n\\} = C' (E-r)r^n = C'(r^{n+1} - r \\cdot r^n) = 0$$\nThis demonstrates that for any non-negative integer $k$, the sequence $x[n] = n^k r^n$ is a solution to $(E-r)^{k+1} x[n] = 0$.\n\nFor our problem, $(E-r)^m x[n] = 0$, this means that any sequence $n^k r^n$ where $k+1 \\le m$, or $k \\le m-1$, is a solution.\nThus, the $m$ sequences $r^n$, $n r^n$, $n^2 r^n$, $\\dots$, $n^{m-1} r^n$ are all solutions to $(E-r)^m x[n] = 0$. These $m$ sequences can be shown to be linearly independent. By the principle of superposition for linear homogeneous equations, any linear combination of these solutions is also a solution. This forms the general solution:\n$$x[n] = C_0 r^n + C_1 n r^n + C_2 n^2 r^n + \\dots + C_{m-1} n^{m-1} r^n$$\n$$x[n] = (C_0 + C_1 n + C_2 n^2 + \\dots + C_{m-1} n^{m-1}) r^n$$\nThis completes the required derivation. The polynomial factors $n^k$ up to degree $k=m-1$ are necessary because the operator $(E-r)^m$ annihilates $n^k r^n$ if and only if $k  m$.\n\nPart 2: Application to the Given Equation\n\nThe LCCDE is $(E-1)^4 x[n] = 0$.

Second, to compute the value of $y_{c}[3]$ for the specific length-$4$ sequences provided, using the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) method.\n\nLet us begin with the derivation. The linear convolution of two sequences $x[n]$ and $h[n]$ is defined as:\n$$y_{\\ell}[n] = \\sum_{m=-\\infty}^{\\infty} x[m]h[n-m]$$\nThe Z-transform of the linear convolution, denoted $Y_{\\ell}(z)$, is the product of the individual Z-transforms $X(z)$ and $H(z)$:\n$$Y_{\\ell}(z) = X(z)H(z)$$\nThe $N$-point DFT of a sequence $x[n]$ (assumed to be zero outside $n \\in \\{0, 1, \\dots, N-1\\}$) is defined as:\n$$X[k] = \\sum_{n=0}^{N-1} x[n] W_N^{nk}, \\quad k \\in \\{0, 1, \\dots, N-1\\}$$\nwhere $W_N = \\exp(-j\\frac{2\\pi}{N})$ is the DFT twiddle factor.

The twiddle factor is $W_4 = \\exp(-j\\frac{2\\pi}{4}) = \\exp(-j\\frac{\\pi}{2}) = -j$.\n\nFirst, we compute the $4$-point DFT of $x[n]$, denoted $X[k]$:\n$$X[k] = \\sum_{n=0}^{3} x[n] W_4^{nk}$$\n$X[0] = x[0] + x[1] + x[2] + x[3] = 1 + 2 - 1 + 0 = 2$.\n$X[1] = x[0]W_4^0 + x[1]W_4^1 + x[2]W_4^2 + x[3]W_4^3 = 1(1) + 2(-j) + (-1)(-1) + 0(j) = 1 - 2j + 1 = 2-2j$.\n$X[2] = x[0]W_4^0 + x[1]W_4^2 + x[2]W_4^4 + x[3]W_4^6 = 1(1) + 2(-1) + (-1)(1) + 0(-1) = 1-2-1 = -2$.\n$X[3] = x[0]W_4^0 + x[1]W_4^3 + x[2]W_4^6 + x[3]W_4^9 = 1(1) + 2(j) + (-1)(-1) + 0(-j) = 1+2j+1 = 2+2j$.\nThus, the DFT of $x[n]$ is $X[k] = \\{2, 2-2j, -2, 2+2j\\}$.\n\nNext, we compute the $4$-point DFT of $h[n]$, denoted $H[k]$:\n$$H[k] = \\sum_{n=0}^{3} h[n] W_4^{nk}$$\n$H[0] = h[0] + h[1] + h[2] + h[3] = 2 + 1 + 0 - 1 = 2$.\n$H[1] = h[0]W_4^0 + h[1]W_4^1 + h[2]W_4^2 + h[3]W_4^3 = 2(1) + 1(-j) + 0(-1) + (-1)(j) = 2 - j - j = 2-2j$.\n$H[2] = h[0]W_4^0 + h[1]W_4^2 + h[2]W_4^4 + h[3]W_4^6 = 2(1) + 1(-1) + 0(1) + (-1)(-1) = 2-1+1 = 2$.\n$H[3] = h[0]W_4^0 + h[1]W_4^3 + h[2]W_4^6 + h[3]W_4^9 = 2(1) + 1(j) + 0(-1) + (-1)(-j) = 2+j+j = 2+2j$.\nThus, the DFT of $h[n]$ is $H[k] = \\{2, 2-2j, 2, 2+2j\\}$.\n\nNow, we find $Y_{c}[k]$ by pointwise multiplication, $Y_{c}[k] = X[k]H[k]$:\n$Y_{c}[0] = X[0]H[0] = 2 \\times 2 = 4$.\n$Y_{c}[1] = X[1]H[1] = (2-2j)(2-2j) = 4 - 8j + 4j^2 = 4 - 8j - 4 = -8j$.\n$Y_{c}[2] = X[2]H[2] = (-2)(2) = -4$.\n$Y_{c}[3] = X[3]H[3] = (2+2j)(2+2j) = 4 + 8j + 4j^2 = 4 + 8j - 4 = 8j$.\nSo, $Y_{c}[k] = \\{4, -8j, -4, 8j\\}$.\n\nFinally, we find $y_{c}[n]$ via the inverse DFT. We only need to compute $y_{c}[3]$.\n$$y_{c}[n] = \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{k=0}^{N-1} Y_{c}[k] W_N^{-nk}$$\nFor $n=3$ and $N=4$:\n$$y_{c}[3] = \\frac{1}{4} \\sum_{k=0}^{3} Y_{c}[k] W_4^{-3k}$$\nThe factor $W_4^{-3k}$ is $(W_4^{-3})^k = (\\exp(j\\frac{6\\pi}{4}))^k = (\\exp(j\\frac{3\\pi}{2}))^k = (-j)^k$.\n$$y_{c}[3] = \\frac{1}{4} \\left( Y_{c}[0](-j)^0 + Y_{c}[1](-j)^1 + Y_{c}[2](-j)^2 + Y_{c}[3](-j)^3 \\right)$$\nSubstituting the values of $Y_c[k]$:\n$$y_{c}[3] = \\frac{1}{4} \\left( (4)(1) + (-8j)(-j) + (-4)(-1) + (8j)(j) \\right)$$\n$$y_{c}[3] = \\frac{1}{4} \\left( 4 + 8j^2 + 4 + 8j^2 \\right)$$\nSince $j^2=-1$:\n$$y_{c}[3] = \\frac{1}{4} \\left( 4 - 8 + 4 - 8 \\right)$$\n$$y_{c}[3] = \\frac{1}{4} (-8) = -2$$\nThe value of the third sample of the circular convolution is $-2$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{-2}$$", "id": "2867253"}]}
