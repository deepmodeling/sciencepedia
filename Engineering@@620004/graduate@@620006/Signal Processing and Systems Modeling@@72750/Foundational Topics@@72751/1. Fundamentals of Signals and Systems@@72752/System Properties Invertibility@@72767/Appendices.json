The final answer must be a single closed-form expression for $g[n]$ in terms of $\\delta[\\cdot]$ and $\\alpha$.\n\nValidation assessment:\nThe problem is scientifically grounded, being a fundamental exercise in the theory of discrete-time LTI systems. It is well-posed, providing sufficient and consistent information to determine a unique, stable, and causal inverse system. The language is objective and precise. The problem is free from scientific unsoundness, ambiguity, and is formalizable within the specified domain of signal processing. It is a standard, non-trivial problem that requires rigorous application of first principles as demanded. Therefore, the problem is deemed valid and a solution will be furnished.\n\nThe objective is to find the impulse response $g[n]$ of a causal LTI system that is the inverse of the system with impulse response $h[n] = \\alpha^n u[n]$. The defining property of an inverse system is that the convolution of the original impulse response and the inverse impulse response yields the Kronecker delta function, which is the identity element for convolution:\n$$ (h*g)[n] = \\delta[n] $$\nWe are instructed to use the Z-transform. The convolution property of the Z-transform states that convolution in the time domain corresponds to multiplication in the Z-domain. Let $H(z) = \\mathcal{Z}\\{h[n]\\}$ and $G(z) = \\mathcal{Z}\\{g[n]\\}$. Applying the Z-transform to the defining equation gives:\n$$ H(z)G(z) = \\mathcal{Z}\\{\\delta[n]\\} $$\nThe Z-transform of the Kronecker delta is $1$. Thus, the transfer function of the inverse system, $G(z)$, is given by:\n$$ G(z) = \\frac{1}{H(z)} $$\nFirst, we must compute $H(z)$, the Z-transform of $h[n] = \\alpha^n u[n]$. By the definition of the two-sided Z-transform:\n$$ H(z) = \\sum_{n=-\\infty}^{\\infty} h[n] z^{-n} = \\sum_{n=-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\alpha^n u[n] z^{-n} $$\nSince $u[n] = 0$ for $n  0$ and $u[n] = 1$ for $n \\ge 0$, the summation becomes:\n$$ H(z) = \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} \\alpha^n z^{-n} = \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} (\\alpha z^{-1})^n $$\nThis is a geometric series which converges if and only if $|\\alpha z^{-1}|  1$. This condition defines the Region of Convergence (ROC) as $|z|  |\\alpha|$. Given that $|\\alpha|  1$, the ROC $|z|  |\\alpha|$ includes the unit circle, $|z|=1$, which is consistent with the fact that the original system is stable (a causal system with $h[n]=\\alpha^n u[n]$ is stable if $|\\alpha|1$). The sum of the convergent geometric series is:\n$$ H(z) = \\frac{1}{1 - \\alpha z^{-1}}, \\quad \\text{ROC: } |z|  |\\alpha| $$\nNow we can determine the transfer function $G(z)$ of the inverse system:\n$$ G(z) = \\frac{1}{H(z)} = \\frac{1}{\\frac{1}{1 - \\alpha z^{-1}}} = 1 - \\alpha z^{-1} $$\nThe expression for $G(z)$ is a finite polynomial in $z^{-1}$, so its ROC is the entire z-plane, except for a possible pole at $z=0$. So the ROC is $|z|0$. To find the impulse response $g[n]$, we compute the inverse Z-transform of $G(z)$. By inspection of the terms:\nThe inverse Z-transform of $1$ is $\\delta[n]$.\nThe inverse Z-transform of $z^{-1}$ is $\\delta[n-1]$.\nTherefore, using the linearity of the Z-transform:\n$$ g[n] = \\mathcal{Z}^{-1}\\{1 - \\alpha z^{-1}\\} = \\mathcal{Z}^{-1}\\{1\\} - \\alpha \\mathcal{Z}^{-1}\\{z^{-1}\\} = \\delta[n] - \\alpha \\delta[n-1] $$\nThis provides the closed-form expression for the impulse response of the inverse system.\n\nNext, we must justify the causality and absolute summability of $g[n]$.\nCausality: A discrete-time system is causal if its impulse response $g[n]$ is zero for all $n  0$. The derived impulse response is $g[n] = \\delta[n] - \\alpha \\delta[n-1]$.\nFor any $n  0$, both $\\delta[n]$ and $\\delta[n-1]$ are zero. Specifically, for $n=-1$, $g[-1] = \\delta[-1] - \\alpha \\delta[-2] = 0 - 0 = 0$. For any $n \\le -2$, all terms are zero. Thus, $g[n]=0$ for all $n0$. The system is causal, as required.\n\nAbsolute Summability (Stability): A system is stable if its impulse response is absolutely summable, meaning $\\sum_{n=-\\infty}^{\\infty} |g[n]|  \\infty$.\nWe compute this sum for our derived $g[n]$:\n$$ \\sum_{n=-\\infty}^{\\infty} |g[n]| = \\sum_{n=-\\infty}^{\\infty} |\\delta[n] - \\alpha \\delta[n-1]| $$\nThe expression is non-zero only at $n=0$ and $n=1$.\nFor $n=0$: $|g[0]| = |\\delta[0] - \\alpha \\delta[-1]| = |1 - \\alpha(0)| = 1$.\nFor $n=1$: $|g[1]| = |\\delta[1] - \\alpha \\delta[0]| = |0 - \\alpha(1)| = |-\\alpha| = |\\alpha|$.\nFor all other integers $n$, $g[n] = 0$.\nThe sum is therefore:\n$$ \\sum_{n=-\\infty}^{\\infty} |g[n]| = |g[0]| + |g[1]| = 1 + |\\alpha| $$\nThe problem states that $|\\alpha|  1$. Therefore, the sum is $1 + |\\alpha|  1 + 1 = 2$. Since the sum is finite, the impulse response $g[n]$ is absolutely summable, and the inverse system is stable.\n\nFinally, we must verify the result $(h*g)[n] = \\delta[n]$ by direct evaluation of the convolution sum in the time domain.\n$$ (h*g)[n] = \\sum_{k=-\\infty}^{\\infty} h[k] g[n-k] $$\nSubstitute the expressions for $h[k] = \\alpha^k u[k]$ and $g[n-k] = \\delta[n-k] - \\alpha \\delta[n-k-1]$:\n$$ (h*g)[n] = \\sum_{k=-\\infty}^{\\infty} (\\alpha^k u[k]) (\\delta[n-k] - \\alpha \\delta[n-k-1]) $$\nBy linearity of summation, we can split this into two sums:\n$$ (h*g)[n] = \\sum_{k=-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\alpha^k u[k] \\delta[n-k] - \\alpha \\sum_{k=-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\alpha^k u[k] \\delta[n-k-1] $$\nWe evaluate each sum using the sifting property of the Kronecker delta, which states that $\\sum_k f[k]\\delta[k-k_0] = f[k_0]$.\nFor the first sum, the delta function $\\delta[n-k]$ is non-zero only when $k=n$. Applying the sifting property:\n$$ \\sum_{k=-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\alpha^k u[k] \\delta[n-k] = \\alpha^n u[n] $$\nFor the second sum, the delta function $\\delta[n-k-1]$ is non-zero only when $k=n-1$. Applying the sifting property:\n$$ \\sum_{k=-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\alpha^k u[k] \\delta[n-k-1] = \\alpha^{n-1} u[n-1] $$\nSubstituting these results back into the expression for the convolution:\n$$ (h*g)[n] = \\alpha^n u[n] - \\alpha (\\alpha^{n-1} u[n-1]) = \\alpha^n u[n] - \\alpha^n u[n-1] $$\nNow, we must analyze this result for all integer values of $n$.\nCase 1: $n  0$.\nIn this case, $u[n] = 0$ and $u[n-1] = 0$.\n$(h*g)[n] = \\alpha^n (0) - \\alpha^n (0) = 0$.\n\nCase 2: $n = 0$.\nIn this case, $u[0] = 1$ and $u[-1] = 0$.\n$(h*g)[0] = \\alpha^0 u[0] - \\alpha^0 u[-1] = 1 \\cdot 1 - 1 \\cdot 0 = 1$.\n\nCase 3: $n  0$.\nIn this case, $u[n] = 1$ and $u[n-1] = 1$.\n$(h*g)[n] = \\alpha^n (1) - \\alpha^n (1) = 0$.\n\nComparing these results with the definition of the Kronecker delta $\\delta[n]$:\n$$ \\delta[n] = \\begin{cases} 1,  n=0 \\\\ 0,  n \\neq 0 \\end{cases} $$\nOur evaluated convolution $(h*g)[n]$ matches $\\delta[n]$ for all $n$.

The problem is objective, free of ambiguity, and contains no scientific or logical contradictions. All information required for a solution is provided.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is **valid**. A solution will be derived in accordance with the specified methodology.\n\n### Solution Derivation\nThe transfer function $H(z)$ of the system is the Z-transform of its impulse response $h[n]$.\n$$H(z) = \\mathcal{Z}\\{h[n]\\} = 1 - 2(1-\\varepsilon)\\cos(\\theta)z^{-1} + (1-\\varepsilon)^{2}z^{-2}$$\nThis is a second-order polynomial in $z^{-1}$. The zeros of $H(z)$ are the roots of the corresponding polynomial in $z$, $z^2 - 2(1-\\varepsilon)\\cos(\\theta)z + (1-\\varepsilon)^2 = 0$. The roots are confirmed to be $z = (1-\\varepsilon)\\exp(\\pm j\\theta)$ as stated in the problem. Let $p_1 = (1-\\varepsilon)\\exp(j\\theta)$ and $p_2 = (1-\\varepsilon)\\exp(-j\\theta)$.\n\nThe transfer function can be written in factored form:\n$$H(z) = (1 - p_1 z^{-1})(1 - p_2 z^{-1})$$\nThe inverse system has a transfer function $G(z)$ such that $H(z)G(z)=1$.\n$$G(z) = \\frac{1}{H(z)} = \\frac{1}{(1 - p_1 z^{-1})(1 - p_2 z^{-1})}$$\nThe poles of $G(z)$ are the zeros of $H(z)$, namely $p_1$ and $p_2$. The system $H(z)$ is FIR, thus $h[n]$ has finite support. In contrast, $G(z)$ has poles, so its impulse response $g[n]$ will have infinite support. This answers the first qualitative question.\n\nTo find the impulse response $g[n]$, we perform a partial fraction expansion of $G(z)$ in terms of $z^{-1}$.\n$$G(z) = \\frac{A}{1 - p_1 z^{-1}} + \\frac{B}{1 - p_2 z^{-1}}$$\nThe coefficients $A$ and $B$ are found to be:\n$$A = \\frac{1}{1-p_2/p_1} = \\frac{p_1}{p_1-p_2}$$\n$$B = \\frac{1}{1-p_1/p_2} = \\frac{p_2}{p_2-p_1} = -A\\frac{p_2}{p_1}$$\nLet's compute $p_1-p_2$:\n$$p_1 - p_2 = (1-\\varepsilon)(\\exp(j\\theta) - \\exp(-j\\theta)) = (1-\\varepsilon)(2j\\sin(\\theta))$$\nFor the case where $\\sin(\\theta) \\neq 0$, the coefficients are:\n$$A = \\frac{(1-\\varepsilon)\\exp(j\\theta)}{(1-\\varepsilon)(2j\\sin(\\theta))} = \\frac{\\exp(j\\theta)}{2j\\sin(\\theta)}$$\n$$B = \\frac{(1-\\varepsilon)\\exp(-j\\theta)}{-(1-\\varepsilon)(2j\\sin(\\theta))} = \\frac{-\\exp(-j\\theta)}{2j\\sin(\\theta)}$$\nThe problem specifies a causal inverse system. The condition $0  \\varepsilon  1$ implies that the poles $p_1$ and $p_2$ have magnitude $|p_1| = |p_2| = 1-\\varepsilon  1$. They lie strictly inside the unit circle, so a stable and causal inverse exists. The region of convergence (ROC) for $G(z)$ is $|z|  1-\\varepsilon$.

The task is to design and implement a program for stable inversion of linear time-invariant (LTI) systems and to determine the minimal preview length required for a given accuracy.\n\nThe core of the problem lies in inverting a nonminimum-phase system in a stable manner. A system with transfer function $H(z)$ is nonminimum-phase if its transfer function $H(z)$ has at least one zero $z_0$ such that $|z_0|  1$. A direct causal inverse $H^{-1}(z)$ would have a pole at $z_0$, located outside the unit circle, rendering the inverse filter Bounded-Input Bounded-Output (BIBO) unstable. The technique of stable inversion overcomes this by implementing the unstable part of the inverse filter anti-causally.\n\nThe overall procedure is as follows:\n\n1.  **System Decomposition**: The transfer function's numerator polynomial, $B(z)$, is factored into its minimum-phase and nonminimum-phase components.\n    $$\n    B(z) = B_{\\min}(z) B_{\\mathrm{nmp}}(z)\n    $$\n    This factorization is achieved by finding the roots of $B(z)$, which are the zeros of the system $H(z)$. The zeros are classified based on their magnitude relative to the unit circle.\n    - Zeros $z_i$ with $|z_i|  1$ are minimum-phase. The polynomial $B_{\\min}(z)$ is constructed from these zeros.\n    - Zeros $z_j$ with $|z_j|  1$ are nonminimum-phase. The polynomial $B_{\\mathrm{nmp}}(z)$ is constructed from these zeros.\n    Given that the original polynomial $B(z)$ has real coefficients, any complex roots will appear in conjugate pairs, ensuring that the resulting polynomials $B_{\\min}(z)$ and $B_{\\mathrm{nmp}}(z)$ also have real coefficients.\n\n2.  **Inverse System Construction**: The inverse system $H^{-1}(z)$ is split into two components:\n    $$\n    H^{-1}(z) = \\frac{A(z)}{B(z)} = \\frac{A(z)}{B_{\\min}(z)} \\cdot \\frac{1}{B_{\\mathrm{nmp}}(z)} = G_{\\mathrm{c}}(z) G_{\\mathrm{a}}(z)\n    $$\n    - The causal component, $G_{\\mathrm{c}}(z) = \\frac{A(z)}{B_{\\min}(z)}$, is BIBO stable because its poles (the zeros of $B_{\\min}(z)$) all lie inside the unit circle. It can be implemented using a standard forward-time recursive filter.\n    - The anti-causal component, $G_{\\mathrm{a}}(z) = \\frac{1}{B_{\\mathrm{nmp}}(z)}$, has poles corresponding to the nonminimum-phase zeros of $H(z)$, which lie outside the unit circle. A causal implementation would be unstable. However, a stable anti-causal implementation is possible.\n\n3.  **Anti-Causal Filtering Implementation**: The stable implementation of $G_{\\mathrm{a}}(z)$ is achieved through time reversal. Filtering a sequence $x[n]$ with an anti-causal filter $G_{\\mathrm{a}}(z)$ is equivalent to performing the following three steps:\n    a. Time-reversing the input signal: $x_{\\mathrm{rev}}[n] = x[-n]$.\n    b. Filtering $x_{\\mathrm{rev}}[n]$ with a causal, stable filter $F(z) = G_{\\mathrm{a}}(1/z)$.\n    c. Time-reversing the output of the filter.\n\n    The transfer function of the reversed filter is $F(z) = 1 / B_{\\mathrm{nmp}}(1/z)$. If $z_j$ is a root of $B_{\\mathrm{nmp}}(z)$ with $|z_j|  1$, then $1/z_j$ is a root of $B_{\\mathrm{nmp}}(1/z)$ with $|1/z_j|  1$. Consequently, all poles of $F(z)$ are inside the unit circle, making it a stable, causal filter. The denominator polynomial of $F(z)$ is constructed from the set of roots $\\{1/z_j\\}$, where $\\{z_j\\}$ are the nonminimum-phase zeros of the original system.\n\n4.  **Finite Preview Approximation**: In practice, we operate on finite-length signals. The desired output $y_{\\mathrm{d}}[n]$ is given for $n \\in \\{0, 1, \\dots, T-1\\}$ and is assumed to be zero otherwise. The anti-causal filtering step requires future values of the signal. We approximate this by using a finite preview of length $L$, effectively operating on a signal composed of $y_{\\mathrm{d}}[n]$ followed by $L$ zero-valued samples. The error resulting from this truncation diminishes as $L$ increases. The rate of error decay depends on the impulse response of the reversed filter $F(z)$, which is determined by the pole of $F(z)$ with the largest magnitude, i.e., $\\max_j |1/z_j| = 1/\\min_j |z_j|$.\n\n5.  **Computation of Minimal Preview Length $L_{\\min}$**: To find the minimal preview length $L_{\\min}$ that achieves a specified accuracy $\\varepsilon$, we perform the following steps for each test case:\n    a. A reference input sequence, $u_{\\mathrm{ref}}[n]$, is computed using a sufficiently large preview length, $L_{\\mathrm{ref}}$, chosen to ensure the truncation error is negligible. A value of $L_{\\mathrm{ref}} = 500$ is chosen, as it is significantly larger than the expected time constants of the anti-causal dynamics in all test cases.\n    b. The input sequence $u_L[n]$ is computed for increasing preview lengths $L = 0, 1, 2, \\dots$.\n    c. For each $L$, the maximum absolute error is calculated over the interval of interest:\n       $$\n       E_L = \\max_{n \\in \\{0, \\dots, T-1\\}} |u_L[n] - u_{\\mathrm{ref}}[n]|\n       $$\n    d. The minimal preview length $L_{\\min}$ is the smallest integer $L$ for which $E_L \\le \\varepsilon$. If this condition is not met for any $L \\le L_{\\mathrm{ref}}$, $L_{\\min}$ is reported as $L_{\\mathrm{ref}}$.\n\nThe implementation will utilize `numpy` for polynomial operations (finding roots via `numpy.roots` and reconstructing polynomials via `numpy.poly`) and `scipy.signal.lfilter` for the implementation of the causal digital filters. For a nonminimum-phase system, the overall signal flow to compute the input $u[n]$ from the desired output $y_{\\mathrm{d}}[n]$ is:\n$$\ny_{\\mathrm{d}}[n] \\xrightarrow{\\text{Pad with } L \\text{ zeros}} \\xrightarrow{\\text{Time Reversal}} \\xrightarrow{\\text{Filter with } F(z)} \\xrightarrow{\\text{Time Reversal}} y_{\\mathrm{c}}[n] \\xrightarrow{\\text{Filter with } G_{\\mathrm{c}}(z)} u[n]\n$$\nFor a minimum-phase system, the anti-causal filtering stage is an identity operation, and $L_{\\min}$ is expected to be $0$.", "answer": "```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy import signal\n\ndef calculate_inverse_input(y_d, preview_L, b_coeffs, a_coeffs):\n    \"\"\"\n    Computes the stable inverse input for a given LTI system and desired output.\n\n    Args:\n        y_d (np.ndarray): The desired output sequence.\n        preview_L (int): The number of preview samples.\n        b_coeffs (np.ndarray): Numerator coefficients of the system H(z).\n        a_coeffs (np.ndarray): Denominator coefficients of the system H(z).\n\n    Returns:\n        np.ndarray: The computed stable inverse input sequence.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Factor the numerator B(z) into minimum and non-minimum phase parts.\n    zeros = np.roots(b_coeffs)\n    min_phase_zeros = zeros[np.abs(zeros)  1.0]\n    non_min_phase_zeros = zeros[np.abs(zeros)  1.0]\n\n    b_min_coeffs = np.poly(min_phase_zeros).real if len(min_phase_zeros)  0 else np.array([1.0])\n\n    # Step 2: Apply the anti-causal filter G_a(z) = 1/B_nmp(z).\n    # This is implemented using time reversal.\n    y_extended = np.concatenate((y_d, np.zeros(preview_L)))\n\n    if len(non_min_phase_zeros)  0:\n        # The reversed filter F(z)=G_a(1/z) has poles at 1/z_j, which are stable.\n        reversed_poles = 1.0 / non_min_phase_zeros\n        a_rev = np.poly(reversed_poles).real\n\n        # Implement G_a(z) via time-reversal and filtering with F(z).\n        y_rev = y_extended[::-1]\n        w_rev = signal.lfilter([1.0], a_rev, y_rev)\n        y_c = w_rev[::-1]\n    else:\n        # If the system is minimum-phase, G_a(z) is identity.\n        y_c = y_extended\n\n    # Step 3: Apply the causal filter G_c(z) = A(z)/B_min(z).\n    u = signal.lfilter(a_coeffs, b_min_coeffs, y_c)\n\n    return u\n\ndef find_min_preview_length(y_d, b_coeffs, a_coeffs, epsilon, L_ref):\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the minimum preview length L_min to meet a given error tolerance.\n\n    Args:\n        y_d (np.ndarray): The desired output sequence.\n        b_coeffs (np.ndarray): Numerator coefficients.\n        a_coeffs (np.ndarray): Denominator coefficients.\n        epsilon (float): The error tolerance.\n        L_ref (int): The reference preview length.\n\n    Returns:\n        int: The minimum required preview length L_min.\n    \"\"\"\n    T = len(y_d)\n\n    # If the system is minimum-phase, no preview is needed.\n    zeros = np.roots(b_coeffs)\n    if not np.any(np.abs(zeros)  1.0):\n        return 0\n\n    # Compute the reference input using a large preview length L_ref.\n    u_ref = calculate_inverse_input(y_d, L_ref, b_coeffs, a_coeffs)\n\n    # Search for the minimum L that satisfies the error criterion.\n    for L in range(L_ref + 1):\n        u_L = calculate_inverse_input(y_d, L, b_coeffs, a_coeffs)\n\n        # The error is the max absolute difference over the original signal duration.\n        error = np.max(np.abs(u_L[:T] - u_ref[:T]))\n\n        if error = epsilon:\n            return L\n\n    # If tolerance is not met, return L_ref.\n    return L_ref\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Main function to define test cases and compute the final results.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define desired output signal parameters\n    T = 256\n    f1 = 0.05\n    f2 = 0.12\n    phi = 0.3\n    n = np.arange(T)\n    y_d = np.sin(2 * np.pi * f1 * n) + 0.5 * np.sin(2 * np.pi * f2 * n + phi)\n\n    # Define test suite\n    test_cases = [\n        # Case A: Nonminimum-phase (1 zero outside unit circle)\n        {'b': np.array([1.0, -1.5]), 'a': np.array([1.0, -0.5]), 'eps': 1e-4},\n        # Case B: Minimum-phase\n        {'b': np.array([1.0, -0.3]), 'a': np.array([1.0, -0.5]), 'eps': 1e-6},\n        # Case C: Nonminimum-phase (2 zeros outside unit circle)\n        {'b': np.array([1.0, -2.45, 1.5]), 'a': np.array([1.0, -1.3, 0.42]), 'eps': 1e-4},\n        # Case D: Mixed-phase (1 zero inside, 1 zero outside unit circle)\n        {'b': np.array([1.0, -1.5, 0.44]), 'a': np.array([1.0, -1.1, 0.18]), 'eps': 1e-4},\n    ]\n\n    # Reference preview length, chosen to be sufficiently large for all cases.\n    L_ref = 500\n\n    results = []\n    for case in test_cases:\n        L_min = find_min_preview_length(y_d, case['b'], case['a'], case['eps'], L_ref)\n        results.append(L_min)\n\n    print(f\"[{','.join(map(str, results))}]\")\n\nsolve()\n```", "id": "2909240"}]}
