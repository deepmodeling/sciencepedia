The solution must be derived from first principles.\n\nFirst, we establish the necessary and sufficient condition for BIBO stability for any discrete-time LTI system with a real-valued impulse response $h[n]$. A system is defined as BIBO-stable if every bounded input produces a bounded output. A bounded input $x[n]$ satisfies $|x[n]| \\le M_x < \\infty$ for all $n \\in \\mathbb{Z}$, where $M_x$ is a finite positive constant. The output $y[n]$ must then satisfy $|y[n]| \\le M_y < \\infty$ for all $n \\in \\mathbb{Z}$, where $M_y$ is some other finite positive constant.\n\nThe output $y[n]$ of an LTI system is given by the convolution sum:\n$$y[n] = \\sum_{k=-\\infty}^{\\infty} h[k] x[n-k]$$\nTo find a bound on the output magnitude, we take the absolute value of both sides:\n$$|y[n]| = \\left| \\sum_{k=-\\infty}^{\\infty} h[k] x[n-k] \\right|$$\nApplying the triangle inequality, we get:\n$$|y[n]| \\le \\sum_{k=-\\infty}^{\\infty} |h[k] x[n-k]| = \\sum_{k=-\\infty}^{\\infty} |h[k]| |x[n-k]|$$\nSince the input is bounded, $|x[n-k]| \\le M_x$ for all $k$. Substituting this into the inequality yields:\n$$|y[n]| \\le \\sum_{k=-\\infty}^{\\infty} |h[k]| M_x = M_x \\sum_{k=-\\infty}^{\\infty} |h[k]|$$\nIf the sum $S = \\sum_{k=-\\infty}^{\\infty} |h[k]|$ is finite, i.e., $S < \\infty$, then the output is bounded, $|y[n]| \\le M_x S$. The product $M_x S$ is a finite constant, so we can set $M_y = M_x S$. This shows that the condition that the impulse response is absolutely summable, $S < \\infty$, is a sufficient condition for BIBO stability.\n\nTo demonstrate necessity, we must show that if $S = \\sum_{k=-\\infty}^{\\infty} |h[k]| = \\infty$, the system is not BIBO-stable. To do this, we construct a specific bounded input that produces an unbounded output. Let us choose the input signal $x[n]$ as:\n$$x[n] = \\text{sgn}(h[-n]) = \\begin{cases} 1, & h[-n] > 0 \\\\ -1, & h[-n] < 0 \\\\ 0, & h[-n] = 0 \\end{cases}$$\nThis input is clearly bounded, as $|x[n]| \\le 1$ for all $n$. Now, we examine the output at the specific time instant $n=0$:\n$$y[0] = \\sum_{k=-\\infty}^{\\infty} h[k] x[-k]$$\nWith our choice of $x[n]$, we have $x[-k] = \\text{sgn}(h[k])$. The output at $n=0$ is then:\n$$y[0] = \\sum_{k=-\\infty}^{\\infty} h[k] \\text{sgn}(h[k])$$\nFor any real number $a$, the product $a \\cdot \\text{sgn}(a)$ is equal to $|a|$. Therefore, $h[k] \\text{sgn}(h[k]) = |h[k]|$. The output becomes:\n$$y[0] = \\sum_{k=-\\infty}^{\\infty} |h[k]| = S$$\nBy our assumption, $S$ is infinite. Thus, for the bounded input $x[n]=\\text{sgn}(h[-n])$, the output $y[0]$ is unbounded. This violates the definition of BIBO stability. Consequently, the condition $S = \\sum_{k=-\\infty}^{\\infty} |h[k]| < \\infty$ is also necessary.\n\nThe necessary and sufficient condition for BIBO stability of an LTI system is that its impulse response must be absolutely summable.\n\nWe now apply this condition to the specific system provided, which has the impulse response:\n$$h[n] \\;=\\; \\begin{cases} (1+n)^{-\\alpha}, & n \\geq 0,\\\\ 0, & n<0, \\end{cases}$$\nThe stability condition is $\\sum_{n=-\\infty}^{\\infty} |h[n]| < \\infty$. Since the system is causal ($h[n]=0$ for $n<0$), the sum starts from $n=0$:\n$$\\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} |(1+n)^{-\\alpha}| < \\infty$$\nFor $n \\ge 0$, the term $1+n$ is always positive. Hence, $(1+n)^{-\\alpha}$ is real and positive, and $|(1+n)^{-\\alpha}| = (1+n)^{-\\alpha}$. The stability condition simplifies to:\n$$\\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} (1+n)^{-\\alpha} < \\infty$$\nTo analyze this series, we perform a change of index by letting $k = n+1$. For $n=0$, $k=1$. As $n \\to \\infty$, $k \\to \\infty$. The series becomes:\n$$\\sum_{k=1}^{\\infty} k^{-\\alpha}$$\nThis is a p-series. As per the problem instructions, we must determine its convergence using a first-principles test. We analyze the behavior for different ranges of $\\alpha$.\n\nIf $\\alpha \\le 0$, the term $a_k = k^{-\\alpha}$ does not converge to $0$ as $k \\to \\infty$. If $\\alpha=0$, $a_k = 1$ for all $k$. If $\\alpha < 0$, $a_k = k^{|\\alpha|}$, which diverges to infinity. In either case, since $\\lim_{k \\to \\infty} a_k \\neq 0$, the series diverges by the term test for divergence. Thus, for stability, we must have $\\alpha > 0$.\n\nFor $\\alpha > 0$, consider the function $f(x) = x^{-\\alpha}$ for $x \\ge 1$. This function is continuous, positive, and decreasing on its domain. Therefore, we can apply the integral test for convergence. The series $\\sum_{k=1}^{\\infty} k^{-\\alpha}$ converges if and only if the improper integral $\\int_{1}^{\\infty} x^{-\\alpha} dx$ converges.\n\nWe must evaluate this integral.\nCase 1: The borderline case, $\\alpha = 1$. The integral is:\n$$\\int_{1}^{\\infty} x^{-1} dx = \\lim_{b \\to \\infty} \\int_{1}^{b} \\frac{1}{x} dx = \\lim_{b \\to \\infty} [\\ln(x)]_{1}^{b} = \\lim_{b \\to \\infty} (\\ln(b) - \\ln(1))$$\nSince $\\lim_{b \\to \\infty} \\ln(b) = \\infty$, the integral diverges for $\\alpha=1$. Therefore, the series also diverges for $\\alpha=1$. The system is unstable at this borderline value.\n\nCase 2: $\\alpha > 0$ and $\\alpha \\neq 1$. The integral is:\n$$\\int_{1}^{\\infty} x^{-\\alpha} dx = \\lim_{b \\to \\infty} \\left[ \\frac{x^{-\\alpha+1}}{-\\alpha+1} \\right]_{1}^{b} = \\frac{1}{1-\\alpha} \\lim_{b \\to \\infty} (b^{1-\\alpha} - 1)$$\nThe convergence of this expression depends on the sign of the exponent $1-\\alpha$.\nIf $1-\\alpha > 0$ (i.e., $0 < \\alpha < 1$), then $\\lim_{b \\to \\infty} b^{1-\\alpha} = \\infty$, and the integral diverges.\nIf $1-\\alpha < 0$ (i.e., $\\alpha > 1$), then $\\lim_{b \\to \\infty} b^{1-\\alpha} = 0$. The integral converges to a finite value: $\\frac{1}{1-\\alpha}(0-1) = \\frac{1}{\\alpha-1}$.\n\nCombining all results:\n- For $\\alpha \\le 0$, the series diverges.\n- For $0 < \\alpha \\le 1$, the series diverges.\n- For $\\alpha > 1$, the series converges.\n\nThe system is BIBO-stable if and only if $\\alpha > 1$. The problem asks for the critical threshold $\\alpha_c$ such that stability holds for $\\alpha > \\alpha_c$. Comparing our derived condition with this form, we conclude that the critical threshold is $\\alpha_c = 1$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{1}$$", "id": "2910005"}, {"introduction": "This exercise explores the classic and deeply insightful paradox of the ideal \"brick-wall\" low-pass filter.

Assume the system is BIBO stable, but $\\|h\\|_{1} = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty}|h(\\tau)|\\,d\\tau = \\infty$. We must construct a bounded input $x(t)$ that produces an unbounded output.

Therefore:\n$$ y(0) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty}|h(\\tau)|\\,d\\tau = \\|h\\|_{1} $$\nBy our initial premise for the contradiction, this value is infinite. So, $y(0) = \\infty$. We have found a bounded input that results in an unbounded output. This contradicts the assumption that the system is BIBO stable. Therefore, the premise that $\\|h\\|_{1}$ is infinite must be false. The condition $\\|h\\|_{1} < \\infty$ is necessary for BIBO stability.\n\nThird, we analyze the absolute integrability of the derived impulse response $h(t)$. We must determine if the integral $S = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty}|h(t)|\\,dt$ converges.\n$$ S = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty}\\left|\\frac{\\sin(\\Omega_{c}t)}{\\pi t}\\right|\\,dt = \\frac{1}{\\pi}\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty}\\frac{|\\sin(\\Omega_{c}t)|}{|t|}\\,dt $$\nThe integrand is an even function, so we can write this as:\n$$ S = \\frac{2}{\\pi}\\int_{0}^{\\infty}\\frac{|\\sin(\\Omega_{c}t)|}{t}\\,dt $$\nWe perform a change of variables, letting $u = \\Omega_{c}t$. This gives $t = u/\\Omega_{c}$ and $dt = du/\\Omega_{c}$. The limits of integration do not change.\n$$ S = \\frac{2}{\\pi}\\int_{0}^{\\infty}\\frac{|\\sin(u)|}{u/\\Omega_{c}}\\frac{du}{\\Omega_{c}} = \\frac{2}{\\pi}\\int_{0}^{\\infty}\\frac{|\\sin(u)|}{u}\\,du $$\nTo determine if this integral converges, we express it as a sum of integrals over intervals of length $\\pi$:\n$$ \\int_{0}^{\\infty}\\frac{|\\sin(u)|}{u}\\,du = \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} \\int_{k\\pi}^{(k+1)\\pi} \\frac{|\\sin(u)|}{u}\\,du $$\nFor any integer $k \\ge 0$, the integral of $|\\sin(u)|$ over the interval $[k\\pi, (k+1)\\pi]$ is constant: $\\int_{k\\pi}^{(k+1)\\pi}|\\sin(u)|\\,du = \\int_{0}^{\\pi}\\sin(v)\\,dv = 2$.\nFor $k \\ge 0$, on the interval $u \\in [k\\pi, (k+1)\\pi]$, the term $1/u$ satisfies the inequality $\\frac{1}{(k+1)\\pi} \\le \\frac{1}{u}$. Thus, we can establish a lower bound for each term in the series:\n$$ \\int_{k\\pi}^{(k+1)\\pi} \\frac{|\\sin(u)|}{u}\\,du \\ge \\int_{k\\pi}^{(k+1)\\pi} \\frac{|\\sin(u)|}{(k+1)\\pi}\\,du = \\frac{1}{(k+1)\\pi}\\int_{k\\pi}^{(k+1)\\pi}|\\sin(u)|\\,du = \\frac{2}{(k+1)\\pi} $$\nThe total integral is therefore bounded below by the sum of these terms:\n$$ \\int_{0}^{\\infty}\\frac{|\\sin(u)|}{u}\\,du \\ge \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} \\frac{2}{(k+1)\\pi} = \\frac{2}{\\pi}\\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{k+1} = \\frac{2}{\\pi}\\sum_{j=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{j} $$\nThe series $\\sum_{j=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{j}$ is the harmonic series, which is known to diverge to infinity. By the direct comparison test, since the integral is greater than or equal to a series that diverges to infinity, the integral itself must diverge. Therefore, the value of $S$ is infinite.\n$$ S = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty}\\bigl|h(t)\\bigr|\\,dt = \\infty $$\nThis result implies that the ideal low-pass filter is not BIBO stable.\n\nFourth, we reconcile the time-domain instability with the frequency-domain properties of $H(\\omega)$. The time-domain analysis concluded the system is not BIBO stable because $h(t)$ is not in the space of absolutely integrable functions, $L^1(\\mathbb{R})$. In the frequency domain, the transfer function $H(\\omega)$ is uniformly bounded, with $|H(\\omega)| \\le 1$ for all $\\omega$. This means $H(\\omega)$ belongs to the space of essentially bounded functions, $L^\\infty(\\mathbb{R})$.\nThe apparent conflict is resolved by understanding that different stability definitions correspond to different function space norms.\n1.  **BIBO Stability**: This corresponds to the stability of a system as an operator from the space of bounded functions, $L^\\infty(\\mathbb{R})$, to itself. The condition for an LTI system's stability in this sense is that its impulse response $h(t)$ must be in $L^1(\\mathbb{R})$. Our analysis confirmed $h(t) \\notin L^1(\\mathbb{R})$. The theory of Fourier transforms states that if $h(t) \\in L^1(\\mathbb{R})$, then its transform $H(\\omega)$ must be a continuous function that vanishes at infinity. The given $H(\\omega)$ has jump discontinuities at $\\omega = \\pm\\Omega_{c}$, which is a definitive indicator that its inverse transform $h(t)$ cannot be in $L^1(\\mathbb{R})$.\n2.  **$L^2$ Stability**: This refers to the stability of a system as an operator from the space of finite-energy signals, $L^2(\\mathbb{R})$, to itself. An LTI system is $L^2$-stable if and only if its frequency response $H(\\omega)$ is in $L^\\infty(\\mathbb{R})$. Since $|H(\\omega)| \\le 1$, this condition is met. By Plancherel's theorem, we can relate the energy of the input and output: $\\|y\\|_{2}^{2} \\le \\|H\\|_{\\infty}^{2}\\|x\\|_{2}^{2}$, where $\\| \\cdot \\|_{2}$ is the $L^2$ norm. In this case, $\\|y\\|_{2}^{2} \\le \\|x\\|_{2}^{2}$, meaning the filter does not amplify signal energy. The energy of the impulse response itself is finite:\n$$ \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty}|h(t)|^2\\,dt = \\frac{1}{2\\pi}\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty}|H(\\omega)|^2\\,d\\omega = \\frac{1}{2\\pi}\\int_{-\\Omega_{c}}^{\\Omega_{c}}1^2\\,d\\omega = \\frac{2\\Omega_{c}}{2\\pi} = \\frac{\\Omega_{c}}{\\pi} < \\infty $$\nThis confirms that $h(t) \\in L^2(\\mathbb{R})$.\n\nIn summary, the boundedness of $H(\\omega)$ implies $L^2$-stability, but not BIBO stability. The condition for BIBO stability is the more stringent requirement that $h(t)$ be absolutely integrable ($h(t) \\in L^1(\\mathbb{R})$), which is not satisfied by the ideal low-pass filter. The system is stable in the sense of energy but unstable in the sense of bounded amplitude.\n\nThe final answer required is the value of the integral $S$.

Consequently, the pole $s = -a$ lies on the negative real axis in the complex plane.\nA continuous-time LTI system is asymptotically stable (possesses stable internal dynamics) if and only if all of its poles lie in the open left-half of the complex plane ($\\text{Re}(s) < 0$). Since the only pole is at $-a < 0$, this condition is satisfied. Therefore, the internal dynamics associated with $H_a(s)$ are stable for all $a>0$. This means that any initial conditions in the system would decay to zero over time.\n\n**3. Demonstration of BIBO Instability**\n\nAn LTI system is BIBO stable if and only if its impulse response $h(t)$ is absolutely integrable, meaning $\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} |h(t)| dt < \\infty$. Let us examine our impulse response, $h_a(t) = \\delta'(t) - a\\delta(t) + a^2 \\exp(-at)u(t)$. This is a distribution, not a regular function. The presence of the $\\delta'(t)$ term indicates that the impulse response is not an element of $L^1(\\mathbb{R})$, the space of absolutely integrable functions. The integral $\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} |\\delta'(t)| dt$ is not finite. Therefore, the system is not BIBO stable.\n\nTo demonstrate this directly using the definition of BIBO stability, we must find a bounded input $x(t)$ that produces an unbounded output $y(t)$. The output $y(t)$ is given by the convolution $y(t) = h_a(t) * x(t)$. Substituting the expression for $h_a(t)$:\n$$\ny(t) = \\left(\\delta'(t) - a\\delta(t) + a^2 \\exp(-at)u(t)\\right) * x(t)\n$$\nUsing the properties of convolution with the Dirac delta distribution and its derivative ($\\delta(t) * x(t) = x(t)$ and $\\delta'(t) * x(t) = x'(t) = \\frac{dx(t)}{dt}$), we obtain the output as:\n$$\ny(t) = x'(t) - ax(t) + \\left(a^2 \\exp(-at)u(t)\\right) * x(t)\n$$\nThe component of the impulse response that causes the failure of BIBO stability is $\\delta'(t)$. This term corresponds to a differentiator. The derivative of a bounded function is not necessarily bounded.\n\nLet us choose a bounded input signal whose derivative is unbounded. A suitable example is $x(t) = \\sin(t^2)$. This input is bounded, since $|\\sin(t^2)| \\le 1$ for all $t \\in \\mathbb{R}$. Its derivative is:\n$$\nx'(t) = \\frac{d}{dt}\\sin(t^2) = 2t \\cos(t^2)\n$$\nThe amplitude of $x'(t)$ is $2|t|$, which grows without bound as $t \\to \\infty$. Thus, $x'(t)$ is an unbounded function.\n\nNow, we analyze the output $y(t)$ for this input:\n- The first term is $x'(t) = 2t \\cos(t^2)$, which is unbounded.\n- The second term is $-ax(t) = -a \\sin(t^2)$, which is bounded, since $|-a \\sin(t^2)| \\le a$.\n- The third term is the convolution $y_p(t) = (a^2 \\exp(-at)u(t)) * x(t)$. The impulse response of this sub-system, $h_p(t) = a^2 \\exp(-at)u(t)$, is absolutely integrable for $a>0$:\n  $$\n  \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} |h_p(\\tau)| d\\tau = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} a^2 \\exp(-a\\tau) d\\tau = a^2 \\left[-\\frac{1}{a}\\exp(-a\\tau)\\right]_{0}^{\\infty} = a^2 \\left(0 - (-\\frac{1}{a})\\right) = a < \\infty\n  $$\n  Therefore, this sub-system is BIBO stable. For a bounded input $x(t)$ with $\\sup_t|x(t)| \\le M$, the output is bounded by $|y_p(t)| \\le M \\int |h_p(\\tau)| d\\tau = M \\cdot a$. In our case $M=1$, so $|y_p(t)| \\le a$.\n\nThe total output $y(t) = 2t\\cos(t^2) - a\\sin(t^2) + y_p(t)$ is the sum of an unbounded function ($2t \\cos(t^2)$) and two bounded functions ($-a \\sin(t^2)$ and $y_p(t)$). The resulting function $y(t)$ is therefore unbounded. This explicitly demonstrates that the system is not BIBO stable, as we have found a bounded input that yields an unbounded output. The violation is a direct consequence of the differentiator term $\\delta'(t)$ in the impulse response.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\delta'(t) - a\\delta(t) + a^2\\exp(-at)u(t)}$$", "id": "2909969"}]}
