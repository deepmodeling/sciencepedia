It is scientifically grounded within its mathematical context and does not contain any of the flaws listed in the validation criteria. The terms are unambiguous, and the required analysis is straightforward.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is deemed valid. A full solution will be provided.\n\nLet the output of the system be denoted by $y(t) = (Tx)(t)$. The system is defined by the input-output relationship:\n$$y(t) = x(t) \\cos(t)$$\n\nWe will now analyze the properties of this system based on formal definitions.\n\n**1. Memorylessness**\nA system is defined as **memoryless** if its output at any given time $t_0$ depends exclusively on the input at that same time $t_0$. For our system, the output at an arbitrary time $t_0$ is given by:\n$$y(t_0) = x(t_0) \\cos(t_0)$$\nThe value of $y(t_0)$ is computed using only the value of the input signal $x(t)$ at the instant $t=t_0$ and the value of the function $\\cos(t)$ at the same instant $t_0$. The output does not depend on past values of the input (i.e., $x(\\tau)$ for $\\tau < t_0$) or future values of the input (i.e., $x(\\tau)$ for $\\tau > t_0$). Therefore, the system is memoryless.\nThis corresponds to the indicator $m=1$.\n\n**2. Causality**\nA system is defined as **causal** if its output at any given time $t_0$ depends only on the present and past values of the input signal. Formally, the output $y(t_0)$ must not depend on the input $x(\\tau)$ for any $\\tau > t_0$.\nAs established in the analysis of memorylessness, the output $y(t_0)$ depends only on the input at the present time $t_0$. Since the system's output does not depend on any future values of the input, the condition for causality is satisfied. It is a general principle that any memoryless system is, by definition, also causal. The set of memoryless systems is a proper subset of the set of causal systems. Since we have demonstrated memorylessness, causality follows directly.\nThis corresponds to the indicator $c=1$.\n\n**3. Time-Invariance**\nA system $T$ is defined as **time-invariant** if a time shift in the input signal results in an identical time shift in the output signal. Let $S_{t_0}$ be the time-shift operator, defined by $(S_{t_0}x)(t) = x(t-t_0)$. A system $T$ is time-invariant if and only if the following equality holds for any input signal $x(t)$ and any time shift $t_0 \\in \\mathbb{R}$:\n$$T(S_{t_0}x) = S_{t_0}(Tx)$$\nWe must test if this condition holds for the given system.\n\nFirst, let us compute the left-hand side of the equation. This represents the system's response to a shifted input. The shifted input is $x_1(t) = (S_{t_0}x)(t) = x(t-t_0)$. The output $y_1(t)$ is:\n$$y_1(t) = (Tx_1)(t) = x_1(t) \\cos(t) = x(t-t_0) \\cos(t)$$\n\nNext, let us compute the right-hand side. This represents the shifted version of the original output. The original output is $y(t) = (Tx)(t) = x(t) \\cos(t)$. The shifted output $y_2(t)$ is:\n$$y_2(t) = (S_{t_0}y)(t) = y(t-t_0) = x(t-t_0) \\cos(t-t_0)$$\n\nFor the system to be time-invariant, we must have $y_1(t) = y_2(t)$ for all $t$ and for any choice of $t_0$. This requires:\n$$x(t-t_0) \\cos(t) = x(t-t_0) \\cos(t-t_0)$$\nFor this equality to hold for any arbitrary input signal $x(t)$ (that is not identically zero), we must have:\n$$\\cos(t) = \\cos(t-t_0)$$\nThis condition must be true for all $t \\in \\mathbb{R}$ and all $t_0 \\in \\mathbb{R}$. This is demonstrably false. For example, let $t_0 = \\frac{\\pi}{2}$. The condition becomes $\\cos(t) = \\cos(t - \\frac{\\pi}{2}) = \\sin(t)$, which is not true for all $t$. As another example, let $t = t_0 = \\pi$. The condition would require $\\cos(\\pi) = \\cos(0)$, which implies $-1 = 1$, a clear contradiction.\nSince the condition for time-invariance is not met, the system is not time-invariant. It is **time-varying**.\nThis corresponds to the indicator $v=1$.\n\nIn summary:\n- Memoryless: Yes ($m=1$)\n- Causal: Yes ($c=1$)\n- Time-varying: Yes ($v=1$)\n\nThe resulting row vector is $[1, 1, 1]$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "2909581"}, {"introduction": "Now, let's explore how these properties manifest in Linear Time-Invariant (LTI) systems using the Laplace transform.

It will be solved as follows.\n\nThe system under consideration is a continuous-time LTI system with the Laplace-domain transfer function $H(s) = \\frac{1}{s}$. To analyze its properties, we must first find its impulse response, $h(t)$, by computing the inverse Laplace transform of $H(s)$. The problem's context, involving questions of causality and physical realizability, necessitates the selection of the causal impulse response. A causal LTI system's transfer function has a Region of Convergence (ROC) that is a right-half plane extending to the right of the rightmost pole. The given transfer function $H(s) = \\frac{1}{s}$ has a single pole at $s=0$. Therefore, for the system to be causal, the ROC must be $\\text{Re}(s) > 0$.\n\nThe inverse Laplace transform of $H(s) = \\frac{1}{s}$ for the ROC $\\text{Re}(s) > 0$ is the Heaviside unit step function, $u(t)$.\n$$\nh(t) = \\mathcal{L}^{-1}\\left\\{\\frac{1}{s}\\right\\}(t) = u(t)\n$$\nwhere $u(t)$ is defined as $u(t) = 1$ for $t \\ge 0$ and $u(t) = 0$ for $t < 0$. With the impulse response $h(t)=u(t)$, we can now evaluate the system's properties.\n\n1.  **Memory ($I_M$):** A system is memoryless if and only if its impulse response is of the form $h(t) = k\\,\\delta(t)$ for some constant $k$, where $\\delta(t)$ is the Dirac delta distribution. The impulse response of this system is $h(t) = u(t)$, which is not a scaled delta function. The output of the system is the convolution of the input $x(t)$ with the impulse response: $y(t) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} u(\\tau) x(t-\\tau)\\,\\mathrm{d}\\tau = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} x(t-\\tau)\\,\\mathrm{d}\\tau$. By a change of variables, this is equivalent to $y(t) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{t} x(\\lambda)\\,\\mathrm{d}\\lambda$. This demonstrates that the output at any time $t$ depends on the history of the input values for times $\\lambda \\le t$. Therefore, the system has memory. The corresponding indicator is $I_M = 1$.\n\n2.  **Causality ($I_C$):** A system is causal if and only if its impulse response $h(t)$ is zero for all negative time, i.e., $h(t)=0$ for $t < 0$. By definition, the unit step function $u(t)$ is zero for $t < 0$. Since our impulse response is $h(t) = u(t)$, the system is causal. The indicator is $I_C = 1$.\n\n3.  **Strict Causality ($I_{SC}$):** A system is strictly causal if it is causal and its impulse response $h(t)$ does not contain a $\\delta(t)$ term. We have established that the system is causal. The impulse response $h(t) = u(t)$ does not contain any Dirac delta component. Therefore, the system is strictly causal. An alternative check is to evaluate the limit of the transfer function as $s \\to \\infty$. A system is strictly causal if this limit is zero. For our system, $\\lim_{s \\to \\infty} H(s) = \\lim_{s \\to \\infty} \\frac{1}{s} = 0$, which confirms strict causality. The indicator is $I_{SC} = 1$.\n\n4.  **Properness ($I_P$):** A rational transfer function $H(s) = \\frac{N(s)}{D(s)}$ is defined as proper if the degree of the numerator polynomial, $\\deg N(s)$, is less than or equal to the degree of the denominator polynomial, $\\deg D(s)$. For $H(s) = \\frac{1}{s}$, the numerator is $N(s) = 1$ and the denominator is $D(s) = s$. The degree of the numerator is $\\deg N(s) = 0$, and the degree of the denominator is $\\deg D(s) = 1$. Since $0 \\le 1$, the transfer function is proper. (It is also strictly proper, since $0 < 1$.) The indicator is $I_P = 1$.\n\n5.  **Physical Realizability ($I_R$):** According to the provided convention, a system is physically realizable if it is causal and its transfer function is a proper rational function with a finite number of poles and zeros.\n    - We have established that the system is causal.\n    - We have established that the transfer function $H(s) = \\frac{1}{s}$ is proper and rational.\n    - The transfer function has one pole at $s=0$ and no finite zeros. The number of poles ($1$) and zeros ($0$) is finite.\n    All conditions are met. Thus, the system is physically realizable. The indicator is $I_R = 1$.\n\nFinally, we compute the index $Q$ using the values of the indicators determined above: $I_M=1$, $I_C=1$, $I_{SC}=1$, $I_P=1$, and $I_R=1$.\n$$\nQ = I_M + 2I_C + 4I_{SC} + 8I_P + 16I_R\n$$\nSubstituting the values:\n$$\nQ = 1 + 2(1) + 4(1) + 8(1) + 16(1)\n$$\n$$\nQ = 1 + 2 + 4 + 8 + 16 = 31\n$$\nThe value of the index is $31$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{31}$$", "id": "2909566"}, {"introduction": "Our final practice transitions to the discrete-time domain, the foundation of modern digital signal processing.

There are no physical units in this problem.", "solution": "The problem shall be analyzed in three parts as specified. The validation of the problem statement has been completed and the problem is deemed scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective.\n\nThe first task is to determine if a causal realization of the system with transfer function $H(z)$ exists. The transfer function is given as\n$$\nH(z)=\\frac{1+0.5\\,z^{-1}}{1-1.2\\,z^{-1}+0.36\\,z^{-2}}.\n$$\nA discrete-time LTI system is causal if its impulse response $h[n]$ is zero for all $n < 0$. Such a sequence is termed right-sided. For a rational transfer function, the bilateral $z$-transform of a right-sided sequence has a Region of Convergence (ROC) that is the exterior of a circle passing through the outermost pole, and this ROC includes the point $|z|=\\infty$. Therefore, a causal realization exists if and only if all poles of $H(z)$ lie within a circle of some finite radius and $H(z)$ has no poles at infinity.\n\nTo find the poles of $H(z)$, we find the roots of the denominator polynomial. Setting the denominator to zero, we have\n$$\n1-1.2\\,z^{-1}+0.36\\,z^{-2} = 0.\n$$\nMultiplying by $z^2$ (assuming $z \\neq 0$), we obtain the characteristic equation in terms of positive powers of $z$:\n$$\nz^2 - 1.2z + 0.36 = 0.\n$$\nThis equation is a perfect square:\n$$\n(z-0.6)^2 = 0.\n$$\nThus, there is a double pole at $z=0.6$. The magnitude of the outermost (and only) pole is $|p| = 0.6$. For a causal system, the ROC must be the region outside this pole, i.e., $|z| > 0.6$.\n\nNext, we must verify that the ROC can include $|z|=\\infty$. This is equivalent to checking if $H(z)$ is bounded as $z \\to \\infty$. We evaluate the limit:\n$$\n\\lim_{z \\to \\infty} H(z) = \\lim_{z \\to \\infty} \\frac{1+0.5\\,z^{-1}}{1-1.2\\,z^{-1}+0.36\\,z^{-2}}.\n$$\nAs $z \\to \\infty$, the terms $z^{-1}$ and $z^{-2}$ approach zero. Therefore,\n$$\n\\lim_{z \\to \\infty} H(z) = \\frac{1+0}{1-0+0} = 1.\n$$\nSince this limit is finite, $H(z)$ does not have a pole at $z=\\infty$. The ROC can be chosen as $|z|>0.6$, which is the exterior of the outermost pole and includes $|z|=\\infty$. Consequently, a causal realization of the system exists.\n\nThe second task is to assess if the system is strictly causal. A system is strictly causal if its output at time $n$, $y[n]$, depends only on past inputs, $x[n-k]$ with $k \\geq 1$. It must not depend on the present input, $x[n]$. This can be determined from the system's difference equation.\nThe input-output relationship in the $z$-domain is $Y(z) = H(z)X(z)$. Substituting the expression for $H(z)$:\n$$\nY(z) = \\frac{1+0.5\\,z^{-1}}{1-1.2\\,z^{-1}+0.36\\,z^{-2}} X(z).\n$$\nCross-multiplication yields:\n$$\nY(z)(1-1.2\\,z^{-1}+0.36\\,z^{-2}) = X(z)(1+0.5\\,z^{-1}).\n$$\nExpanding this gives:\n$$\nY(z) - 1.2z^{-1}Y(z) + 0.36z^{-2}Y(z) = X(z) + 0.5z^{-1}X(z).\n$$\nApplying the inverse $z$-transform, and using the property that multiplication by $z^{-k}$ in the $z$-domain corresponds to a time shift to $n-k$ in the time domain, we obtain the difference equation:\n$$\ny[n] - 1.2y[n-1] + 0.36y[n-2] = x[n] + 0.5x[n-1].\n$$\nSolving for the current output $y[n]$:\n$$\ny[n] = x[n] + 0.5x[n-1] + 1.2y[n-1] - 0.36y[n-2].\n$$\nThe right-hand side of this equation contains the term $x[n]$, which represents the present input. The presence of this \"feedthrough\" term means the output $y[n]$ depends directly on the input $x[n]$. Therefore, the system is causal but not strictly causal. This is also evident from the fact that the first term of the impulse response, $h[0]$, is non-zero, as $h[0] = \\lim_{z \\to \\infty} H(z) = 1$.\n\nThe third task is to find the smallest non-negative integer $d$ such that the delayed system $z^{-d}H(z)$ is strictly causal. Let the new transfer function be $G(z) = z^{-d}H(z)$. For $G(z)$ to represent a strictly causal system, its impulse response $g[n]$ must satisfy $g[0]=0$. By the initial value theorem of the $z$-transform, for a causal sequence $g[n]$, its initial value is given by $g[0] = \\lim_{z \\to \\infty} G(z)$.\nThus, we require finding the smallest non-negative integer $d$ such that:\n$$\n\\lim_{z \\to \\infty} G(z) = \\lim_{z \\to \\infty} z^{-d}H(z) = 0.\n$$\nWe have already calculated that $\\lim_{z \\to \\infty} H(z) = 1$. The condition becomes:\n$$\n\\lim_{z \\to \\infty} z^{-d} \\cdot 1 = 0.\n$$\nWe test non-negative integer values for $d$:\nFor $d=0$: $\\lim_{z \\to \\infty} z^0 = 1 \\neq 0$. The system $H(z)$ is not strictly causal.\nFor $d=1$: $\\lim_{z \\to \\infty} z^{-1} = 0$. The condition is satisfied.\nSince we seek the smallest non-negative integer $d$, the minimal value is $d=1$.\n\nAn alternative, equivalent approach is to consider the degrees of the numerator and denominator polynomials of the transfer function when expressed in positive powers of $z$.\n$$\nH(z) = \\frac{z^2(1+0.5\\,z^{-1})}{z^2(1-1.2\\,z^{-1}+0.36\\,z^{-2})} = \\frac{z^2+0.5z}{z^2-1.2z+0.36}.\n$$\nLet $N(z) = z^2+0.5z$ and $D(z) = z^2-1.2z+0.36$. The degree of the numerator is $\\deg(N) = 2$ and the degree of the denominator is $\\deg(D) = 2$. A rational transfer function represents a strictly causal system if and only if $\\deg(N) < \\deg(D)$. Here, $\\deg(N) = \\deg(D)$, so the system is not strictly causal.\nNow consider $G(z) = z^{-d}H(z)$:\n$$\nG(z) = z^{-d} \\frac{z^2+0.5z}{z^2-1.2z+0.36} = \\frac{z^{2-d}+0.5z^{1-d}}{z^2-1.2z+0.36}.\n$$\nThe numerator of $G(z)$ is $N'(z) = z^{2-d}+0.5z^{1-d}$, which has degree $\\deg(N') = 2-d$. For strict causality, we require $\\deg(N') < \\deg(D)$:\n$$\n2-d < 2.\n$$\nThis inequality simplifies to $-d < 0$, or $d > 0$. The smallest non-negative integer $d$ satisfying $d>0$ is $d=1$.
