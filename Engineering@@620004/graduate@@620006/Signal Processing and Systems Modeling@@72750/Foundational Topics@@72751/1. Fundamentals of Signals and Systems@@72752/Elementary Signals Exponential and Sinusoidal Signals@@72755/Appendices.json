The signal $x(t)$ is specified as causal, which implies $x(t) = 0$ for $t  0$. We must derive the result using the definition of the Laplace transform, its linearity property, and Euler's identity.\n\nFirst, we establish the fundamental transform pair for a causal complex exponential function, $f(t) = \\exp(s_0 t) u(t)$, where $s_0$ is a complex constant and $u(t)$ is the Heaviside unit step function. The unilateral Laplace transform is defined as $X(s) = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} x(t) \\exp(-st) dt$.\n$$\n\\mathcal{L}\\{\\exp(s_0 t) u(t)\\} = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\exp(s_0 t) \\exp(-st) dt = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\exp(-(s-s_0)t) dt\n$$\nThis integral converges for $\\text{Re}(s-s_0) > 0$, or $\\text{Re}(s) > \\text{Re}(s_0)$.

To do this, we manipulate the numerator, $s+1$, to contain the term $s-\\sigma_0 = s+2$:\n$$\ns+1 = (s+2) - 1\n$$\nUsing this, we express $X(s)$ as a sum of two terms:\n$$\nX(s) = \\frac{(s+2) - 1}{(s+2)^2+3^2} = \\frac{s+2}{(s+2)^2+3^2} - \\frac{1}{(s+2)^2+3^2}\n$$\nBy linearity of the inverse transform, we can find the inverse of each term separately.\nThe first term, $\\frac{s+2}{(s+2)^2+3^2}$, corresponds directly to the transform of an exponentially damped cosine with $\\sigma_0 = -2$ and $\\omega_0 = 3$.\n$$\n\\mathcal{L}^{-1}\\left\\{\\frac{s+2}{(s+2)^2+3^2}\\right\\} = \\exp(-2t)\\cos(3t)u(t)\n$$\nThe second term is $-\\frac{1}{(s+2)^2+3^2}$.

This demonstrates that the periodicity condition is independent of the phase $\\phi$. We are left with:\n$$2\\pi \\frac{k_{0}}{N} L = 2\\pi m$$\nDividing by $2\\pi$ (which is permissible as it is a non-zero constant), we obtain the condition:\n$$\\frac{k_{0}L}{N} = m$$\nThis equation signifies that the quantity $\\frac{k_{0}L}{N}$ must be an integer.

If $k_0=0$, the signal becomes $x[n] = \\cos(\\phi)$, a constant sequence. For a non-zero constant sequence, the fundamental period is $L=1$. In this special case ($k_0=0$), the condition from Case 1 ($0 \\cdot L = m N$) is satisfied for any $L$ with $m=0$; the smallest positive $L$ is $1$. Thus, for the general non-trivial case where $k_0 \\neq 0$, Case 2 is ruled out.\n\nWe therefore proceed with the condition derived from Case 1: $k_{0}L = mN$. We seek the fundamental period, which is the smallest positive integer $L$ that satisfies this equation for some integer $m$.\nLet $g = \\gcd(k_{0}, N)$ be the greatest common divisor of $k_0$ and $N$. Note that since $N0$, the GCD is well-defined and positive.

Since $k'_{0}$ and $N'$ are coprime, by Euclid's lemma, it must be that $N'$ divides $L$.\nTherefore, $L$ must be an integer multiple of $N'$. We can write $L = q \\cdot N'$ for some integer $q$.\nThe fundamental period is the smallest positive integer $L$. To obtain this, we must choose the smallest positive integer value for $q$, which is $q=1$.\nThis gives the fundamental period $L_{min}$ as:\n$$L = N'$$\nSubstituting the definition of $N'$ back, we get:\n$$L = \\frac{N}{g} = \\frac{N}{\\gcd(k_{0}, N)}$$\nThis derivation is valid for any integer $k_0$. If $k_0$ is negative, say $k_0 = -|k_0|$, the cosine function's even property means $x[n] = \\cos(-2\\pi \\frac{|k_0|}{N} n + \\phi) = \\cos(2\\pi \\frac{|k_0|}{N} n - \\phi)$.
