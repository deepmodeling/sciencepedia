We must begin by validating the problem statement itself.\n\nThe givens are:\n1.  A continuous-time signal has a Fourier transform $X_c(j\\Omega)$ that is zero for $|\\Omega| > \\Omega_b$.\n2.  The sampling period is $T$, and the sampling frequency is $\\Omega_s = 2\\pi/T$.\n3.  A strict non-aliasing condition holds: $\\Omega_b < \\pi/T$, which is equivalent to $\\Omega_b < \\Omega_s/2$.\n4.  The signal is sampled using an impulse train, resulting in a sampled signal whose continuous-time Fourier transform, $X_s(j\\Omega)$, is a periodic repetition of $X_c(j\\Omega)$. Specifically, $X_s(j\\Omega) = \\frac{1}{T} \\sum_{k=-\\infty}^{\\infty} X_c(j(\\Omega - k\\Omega_s))$.\n5.  Reconstruction is achieved with a lowpass filter with passband edge $\\Omega_p$ and stopband edge $\\Omega_{s1}$.\n6.  The stopband must begin no later than the start of the first spectral image, i.e., $\\Omega_{s1} \\leq (\\Omega_s - \\Omega_b)$.\n7.  The transition band width is defined as $\\Delta \\Omega \\triangleq \\Omega_{s1} - \\Omega_p$.\n8.  The objective is to find the maximal value of $\\Delta \\Omega$.\n\nThe problem is scientifically grounded in the principles of the Nyquist-Shannon sampling theorem and filter theory. It is well-posed, as the constraints are sufficient to determine a unique maximum for the quantity of interest. The language is objective and precise. Therefore, the problem is deemed valid and a solution can be constructed.\n\nThe spectrum of the sampled signal, $X_s(j\\Omega)$, consists of scaled copies of the original spectrum, $X_c(j\\Omega)$, centered at integer multiples of the sampling frequency $\\Omega_s$. The baseband component (for $k=0$) occupies the frequency interval $[-\\Omega_b, \\Omega_b]$. The first spectral images (for $k=\\pm 1$) are centered at $\\Omega = \\pm \\Omega_s$. Specifically, the image for $k=1$ occupies the interval $[\\Omega_s - \\Omega_b, \\Omega_s + \\Omega_b]$, and the image for $k=-1$ occupies $[-\\Omega_s - \\Omega_b, -\\Omega_s + \\Omega_b]$.\n\nThe condition $\\Omega_b < \\Omega_s/2$ ensures that there is no overlap between the baseband spectrum and its images. The frequency range between the end of the baseband spectrum and the beginning of the first positive-frequency image is called the guard band. The baseband spectrum ends at $\\Omega = \\Omega_b$. The first image begins at $\\Omega = \\Omega_s - \\Omega_b$. The guard band is the interval $(\\Omega_b, \\Omega_s - \\Omega_b)$.\n\nA lowpass filter used for perfect reconstruction must satisfy two conditions:\n1.  It must pass the entire baseband spectrum without distortion. For an ideal lowpass filter, this implies its passband must cover the interval $[-\\Omega_b, \\Omega_b]$. Considering only positive frequencies, the passband edge $\\Omega_p$ must satisfy the condition $\\Omega_p \\geq \\Omega_b$.\n2.  It must completely eliminate all spectral images. This means its stopband must begin at or before the start of the first image. Considering the first positive-frequency image, the stopband edge $\\Omega_{s1}$ must satisfy the condition $\\Omega_{s1} \\leq \\Omega_s - \\Omega_b$. This is consistent with the constraint provided in the problem statement.\n\nThe transition band of the filter is the frequency range $[\\Omega_p, \\Omega_{s1}]$, and its width is defined as $\\Delta \\Omega = \\Omega_{s1} - \\Omega_p$. We are asked to find the maximal possible value for this width. To maximize $\\Delta \\Omega$, we must maximize the term $\\Omega_{s1}$ and minimize the term $\\Omega_p$, subject to the constraints derived above.\n$$\n\\Delta \\Omega = \\Omega_{s1} - \\Omega_p \\leq (\\Omega_s - \\Omega_b) - \\Omega_b\n$$\nThe maximum value of $\\Omega_{s1}$ is $\\Omega_s - \\Omega_b$. The minimum value of $\\Omega_p$ is $\\Omega_b$. Substituting these extremal values into the expression for $\\Delta \\Omega$ gives the maximal possible transition band width, which we denote as $\\Delta \\Omega_{\\text{max}}$.\n$$\n\\Delta \\Omega_{\\text{max}} = (\\Omega_s - \\Omega_b)_{\\text{max}} - (\\Omega_p)_{\\text{min}}\n$$\nSetting $(\\Omega_{s1})_{\\text{max}} = \\Omega_s - \\Omega_b$ and $(\\Omega_p)_{\\text{min}} = \\Omega_b$, we obtain:\n$$\n\\Delta \\Omega_{\\text{max}} = (\\Omega_s - \\Omega_b) - \\Omega_b = \\Omega_s - 2\\Omega_b\n$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be expressed as a function of $T$ and $\\Omega_b$.

It is the maximal frequency range that the transition band of the reconstruction filter can occupy while still ensuring perfect recovery of the original signal.

A rigorous solution can be derived. We proceed.\n\nThe solution requires analyzing the signal in the frequency domain at each stage of the conversion process. Let $\\omega$ denote the frequency variable in radians per sample for the signal at the intermediate stage (after upsampling and before downsampling).\n\n1.  **Upsampling by $L$**: The input signal $x[n]$ with spectrum $X(\\exp(j\\omega_x))$ is upsampled to produce $v[n]$. The spectrum of $v[n]$ is given by $V(\\exp(j\\omega)) = X(\\exp(j\\omega L))$. The original spectrum of $x[n]$, which was bandlimited to $[-\\omega_b, \\omega_b]$, is compressed by a factor of $L$ to occupy the band $[-\\omega_b/L, \\omega_b/L]$. Additionally, $L-1$ spectral images (replicas) are created, centered at frequencies $2\\pi k/L$ for $k=1, 2, ..., L-1$. The magnitude of these images is also bounded by $1$.\n\n2.  **Filtering**: The signal $v[n]$ is passed through the lowpass filter $H(\\exp(j\\omega))$ to produce $w[n]$. The spectrum is $W(\\exp(j\\omega)) = H(\\exp(j\\omega))V(\\exp(j\\omega))$. The purpose of this filter is twofold:\n    - It must pass the desired baseband component, which is the compressed version of the original signal's spectrum residing in $[-\\omega_b/L, \\omega_b/L]$.\n    - It must attenuate all spurious content, which includes the spectral images created by upsampling and any components that would cause aliasing upon downsampling.\n\n3.  **Downsampling by $M$**: The filtered signal $w[n]$ is downsampled to produce the output $y[n]$. The spectrum $Y(\\exp(j\\omega_y))$ is given by the aliasing formula:\n    $$Y(\\exp(j\\omega_y)) = \\frac{1}{M} \\sum_{k=0}^{M-1} W(\\exp(j\\frac{\\omega_y - 2\\pi k}{M}))$$\n    The term for $k=0$ represents the desired output spectrum, while the terms for $k=1, \\dots, M-1$ represent aliased components.\n\nTo satisfy the problem's requirements, the filter $H(\\exp(j\\omega))$ must be specified such that all spurious content is attenuated to a level of $\\delta$. This requires defining the passband and stopband edges, $\\Omega_p$ and $\\Omega_s$, as stringently as possible, which in turn defines the transition width $\\Delta\\omega$.\n\n**Passband Requirement**: The filter must preserve the baseband component of $V(\\exp(j\\omega))$, which is non-zero in the interval $[-\\omega_b/L, \\omega_b/L]$. Therefore, this entire interval must lie within the filter's passband. The tightest specification that satisfies this is to set the passband edge precisely at the edge of the signal's bandwidth:\n$$\\Omega_p = \\frac{\\omega_b}{L}$$\n\n**Stopband Requirement**: The filter's stopband must attenuate all unwanted frequency components to prevent them from appearing as spurious content in the output. There are two sources of such components at the filter's input $V(\\exp(j\\omega))$:\n1.  **Imaging from Upsampling**: The first spectral image lies in the frequency band $[2\\pi/L - \\omega_b/L, 2\\pi/L + \\omega_b/L]$. To attenuate this image, the filter's stopband must begin at or before the lower edge of this band. This imposes the constraint:\n    $$\\Omega_s \\leq \\frac{2\\pi}{L} - \\frac{\\omega_b}{L}$$\n2.  **Aliasing from Downsampling**: To prevent any aliasing in the output signal $y[n]$, the signal $w[n]$ entering the downsampler must be bandlimited to the Nyquist frequency of the output sample rate, which is $\\pi/M$. Any energy in $W(\\exp(j\\omega))$ at frequencies $|\\omega| \\geq \\pi/M$ will fold into the baseband $[-\\pi, \\pi]$ of the output signal spectrum $Y(\\exp(j\\omega_y))$. To bound all such spurious content, the filter's stopband must begin at or before $\\pi/M$. This imposes the constraint:\n    $$\\Omega_s \\leq \\frac{\\pi}{M}$$\n\nTo guarantee that both imaging and aliasing artifacts are suppressed, the filter's stopband must satisfy both constraints simultaneously. Thus, the stopband edge must be chosen to satisfy:\n$$\\Omega_s \\leq \\min\\left(\\frac{2\\pi}{L} - \\frac{\\omega_b}{L}, \\frac{\\pi}{M}\\right)$$\nTo allow for the widest possible transition band for a given passband requirement (which makes the filter easier to implement), one would choose the largest possible value for $\\Omega_s$. The tightest specification for the stopband, which defines the region that must be attenuated, is therefore:\n$$\\Omega_s = \\min\\left(\\frac{2\\pi}{L} - \\frac{\\omega_b}{L}, \\frac{\\pi}{M}\\right)$$\n\nThe problem asks for the smallest admissible transition width, $\\Delta\\omega = \\Omega_s - \\Omega_p$. This is the frequency range between the required passband edge and the required stopband edge. Using the expressions derived for $\\Omega_p$ and $\\Omega_s$:\n$$\\Delta\\omega = \\Omega_s - \\Omega_p = \\min\\left(\\frac{2\\pi}{L} - \\frac{\\omega_b}{L}, \\frac{\\pi}{M}\\right) - \\frac{\\omega_b}{L}$$\nThe given feasibility condition $\\omega_b/L \\leq \\pi/M$ and the inherent condition $\\omega_b < \\pi$ (which implies $2\\omega_b/L < 2\\pi/L$) ensure that $\\Delta\\omega \\geq 0$. The expression is the final closed-form result.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\min\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{M}, \\frac{2\\pi}{L} - \\frac{\\omega_b}{L}\\right) - \\frac{\\omega_b}{L}}$$", "id": "2878669"}, {"introduction": "While theoretical interpolation often assumes access to an infinite signal sequence, practical applications rely on processing finite blocks of data with computational tools like the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT).

The reconstruction is given by:\n$$ x_{c}(t) = \\sum_{n=-\\infty}^{\\infty} x[n] \\operatorname{sinc}\\left(\\frac{t - nT_{s}}{T_{s}}\\right) $$\nwhere $\\operatorname{sinc}(u) = \\frac{\\sin(\\pi u)}{\\pi u}$ and $T_s = 1/f_s$.

The use of a finite block of $N$ samples is a feature of Procedure $2$, whereas Procedure $1$ is defined with respect to the ideal reconstruction from the entire sample sequence $x[n]$.\n\n**Procedure 2: Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) Zero-Padding Interpolation**\n\nThis procedure operates exclusively on a finite block of $N$ samples, denoted as $\\{x[0], x[1], \\ldots, x[N-1]\\}$.\n1.  It computes the $N$-point DFT:\n    $$ X[k] = \\sum_{n=0}^{N-1} x[n] e^{-j 2\\pi nk/N}, \\quad k = 0, 1, \\ldots, N-1 $$\n2.  It forms a new $LN$-point spectrum $X_{L}[k]$ by inserting $(L-1)N$ zeros into the middle of $X[k]$. This preserves the low-frequency components and sets the higher-frequency components to zero.\n3.  It computes the inverse $LN$-point DFT of $X_{L}[k]$ to obtain the interpolated sequence:\n    $$ x_{L}[m] = \\frac{1}{LN} \\sum_{k=0}^{LN-1} X_{L}[k] e^{j 2\\pi mk/(LN)}, \\quad m = 0, 1, \\ldots, LN-1 $$\n\nThe fundamental characteristic of the DFT is that it implicitly treats the finite data block $\\{x[0], \\ldots, x[N-1]\\}$ as one period of an $N$-periodic discrete-time sequence. Let this periodic sequence be $x_p[n]$, where $x_p[n] = x[n \\pmod N]$.\nProcedure $2$ is known to be equivalent to performing ideal discrete-time interpolation on this periodic sequence $x_p[n]$. This involves upsampling $x_p[n]$ by a factor of $L$ (by inserting $L-1$ zeros between each sample) and then applying an ideal discrete-time low-pass filter with a cutoff frequency of $\\pi/L$. The resulting signal $x_L[m]$ is periodic with period $LN$ and its values at indices $m = rL$ match the original samples, i.e., $x_L[rL] = x[r]$ for $r=0, \\ldots, N-1$.\n\nThe core difference between the two procedures is that Procedure $1$ interpolates the true underlying signal $x_c(t)$ (via its full set of samples $x[n]$), which is generally not periodic. Procedure $2$ interpolates an artificial periodic signal constructed from a finite $N$-sample block. This difference is a form of time-domain aliasing or wrap-around error, where the infinite-support sinc interpolator of Procedure $1$ is effectively replaced by its periodically-summed version (the Dirichlet kernel) in Procedure $2$.\n\nNow, let us evaluate each statement.\n\n**A. For any strictly bandlimited $x_{c}(t)$ with $B < f_{s}/2$ and any contiguous block of $N$ samples, Procedure $2$ produces $x_{L}[m]$ that are exactly equal to the values from Procedure $1$ evaluated at $t = m \\, T_{s} / L$.**\n\nThis statement is **Incorrect**. As established, Procedure $2$ is based on a periodic assumption for the $N$-sample block. Procedure $1$ operates on the true, generally non-periodic signal. The sinc interpolation of Procedure $1$ uses samples from outside the $[0, N-1]$ window to calculate interpolated values inside this window's time-span. For instance, to compute $x_c(0.5 T_s)$, the formula involves $x[0]$, $x[1]$, but also $x[-1]$, $x[2]$, etc., with decreasing weights. Procedure $2$, based on the DFT of only $\\{x[0], \\ldots, x[N-1]\\}$, implicitly assumes that samples outside this block are periodic repetitions, e.g., $x[-1] = x[N-1]$. Since for a general non-periodic signal $x[-1] \\neq x[N-1]$, the two procedures will produce different results. The equality holds only under specific conditions, not for \"any\" bandlimited signal.\n\n**B. Procedure $2$ is mathematically equivalent to ideal bandlimited interpolation of the $N$-periodic extension of the discrete-time sequence, i.e., the sequence obtained by repeating $\\{x[0], \\ldots, x[N-1]\\}$ with period $N$.**\n\nThis statement is **Correct**. This is a standard result in digital signal processing. Let $x_p[n]$ be the periodic extension of the $N$-sample block. \"Ideal bandlimited interpolation\" of a discrete sequence $x_p[n]$ refers to finding a signal that contains the maximum possible frequency content of $x_p[n]$ but is bandlimited to an appropriate sub-band. In the context of upsampling by $L$, this means finding an interpolated sequence whose DTFT is zero for frequencies $|\\omega| > \\pi/L$. This is achieved by creating an upsampled sequence (by inserting $L-1$ zeros between samples of $x_p[n]$) and then applying an ideal discrete-time low-pass filter. This entire process in the time domain is equivalent to zero-padding the DFT of one period of $x_p[n]$ in the frequency domain and then computing the inverse DFT. Therefore, this statement accurately describes Procedure $2$.\n\n**C. Procedures $1$ and $2$ produce exactly the same interpolated samples at all $t = m \\, T_{s} / L$ if $x_{c}(t)$ is exactly periodic with period $N T_{s}$, strictly bandlimited to $B < f_{s}/2$, and the given $N$ samples constitute one full period.**\n\nThis statement is **Correct**. This describes the specific condition under which the periodic assumption of Procedure $2$ matches the reality of Procedure $1$.\nIf $x_{c}(t)$ is periodic with period $T_p = NT_s$, its spectrum is a line spectrum, with non-zero Fourier series coefficients $d_k$ only at frequencies $f_k = k/T_p = k/(NT_s)$. The condition that $x_c(t)$ is bandlimited to $B < f_s/2$ means that $d_k=0$ for all $|f_k| \\ge B$. This implies $|k/(NT_s)| < f_s/2 = 1/(2T_s)$, which simplifies to $|k| < N/2$. The signal is thus a finite sum of complex exponentials (a trigonometric polynomial).\nThe $N$ samples $x[n] = x_{c}(nT_s)$ for $n=0, \\ldots, N-1$ contain all the information about this signal. The $N$-point DFT of these samples, $X[k]$, yields values proportional to the Fourier series coefficients $d_k$ and will be non-zero only for indices $k$ corresponding to frequencies below the bandlimit (i.e., for $|k|<N/2$).\nProcedure $2$ takes this DFT $X[k]$, zero-pads it, and computes the inverse DFT. This is mathematically equivalent to evaluating the original trigonometric polynomial $x_c(t)$ at the new time points $t = m T_s / L$.\nProcedure $1$, ideal bandlimited reconstruction, will also perfectly reconstruct the original signal $x_c(t)$ since the Nyquist criterion is met.\nSince both procedures reconstruct the same signal $x_c(t)$ and evaluate it at the same time instances, their outputs will be identical.\n\n**D. Applying a smooth tapering window to $\\{x[0], \\ldots, x[N-1]\\}$ before computing the DFT removes the circularity inherent in Procedure $2$, so that zero-padding and inverse transforming yields exactly the same interpolated values as Procedure $1$ for nonperiodic data.**\n\nThis statement is **Incorrect**. Windowing is a common technique used to reduce spectral leakage, which arises from the artificial discontinuity at the block edges when the DFT imposes periodicity. A tapering window forces the block values to zero at the ends, making the periodic extension continuous and thus reducing artifacts. However, this is an approximation technique, not a method for exact reconstruction.\nFirst, multiplying the data $x[n]$ by a window function $w[n]$ fundamentally alters the signal being analyzed. The DFT is computed for $x[n]w[n]$, not $x[n]$. In the frequency domain, this corresponds to convolving the true spectrum with the spectrum of the window, leading to spectral smearing. The interpolated result will be an approximation of a smoothed version of the true signal, but not the true signal itself.\nSecond, the claim of \"exactly the same\" is mathematically impossible. Procedure $1$ is defined using an infinite sequence of unmodified samples. No finite-length operation like windowing a block of $N$ samples can perfectly replicate the result of the infinite summation in the sinc interpolation formula for a general non-periodic signal.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{BC}$$", "id": "2878710"}]}
