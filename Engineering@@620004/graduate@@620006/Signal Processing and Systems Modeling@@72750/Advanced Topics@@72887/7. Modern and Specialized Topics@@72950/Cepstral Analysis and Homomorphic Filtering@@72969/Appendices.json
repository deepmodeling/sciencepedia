We are tasked to find the coefficients $c[n]$ of the Laurent series expansion of $C(z)$, which is valid in an annulus containing the unit circle.\n\nThe zeros of $H(z)$ are located at $z = \\alpha$ and $z = \\alpha^{-1}$. Since $\\alpha > 1$, the zero at $z=\\alpha$ is outside the unit circle, and the zero at $z=\\alpha^{-1}$ is inside the unit circle. The function $\\ln H(z)$ is analytic in the annulus $\\alpha^{-1} < |z| < \\alpha$, which contains the unit circle. Therefore, a unique Laurent series expansion for $C(z)$ exists in this region.\n\nUsing the property of the logarithm, we can write $C(z)$ as a sum:\n$$C(z) = \\ln\\left(1 - \\alpha z^{-1}\\right) + \\ln\\left(1 - \\alpha^{-1} z^{-1}\\right)$$\nWe will analyze the contribution of each term to the cepstrum $c[n]$. The total cepstrum is the sum of these contributions, $c[n] = c_{max}[n] + c_{min}[n]$.\n\n(a) Derivation of the complex cepstrum $c[n]$ for $n \\neq 0$.\n\nFirst, consider the term associated with the zero inside the unit circle, $z=\\alpha^{-1}$. This is the minimum-phase component.\n$$C_{min}(z) = \\ln\\left(1 - \\alpha^{-1} z^{-1}\\right)$$\nWe use the provided power-series identity $\\ln(1 - u) = -\\sum_{k=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{u^{k}}{k}$, which is valid for $|u| < 1$. Let $u = \\alpha^{-1} z^{-1}$. The condition for convergence is $|\\alpha^{-1} z^{-1}| < 1$, which simplifies to $|z| > \\alpha^{-1}$. Since $\\alpha > 1$, we have $\\alpha^{-1} < 1$, so the region of convergence $|z| > \\alpha^{-1}$ includes the unit circle. The expansion is:\n$$C_{min}(z) = -\\sum_{k=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{\\left(\\alpha^{-1} z^{-1}\\right)^{k}}{k} = -\\sum_{k=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{\\alpha^{-k}}{k} z^{-k}$$\nThis is a series in negative powers of $z$, corresponding to a causal sequence. By comparing with the definition $C_{min}(z) = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} c_{min}[n] z^{-n}$, we identify the coefficients for positive quefrencies ($n > 0$):\n$$c_{min}[n] = -\\frac{\\alpha^{-n}}{n} \\quad \\text{for } n \\ge 1$$\nFor $n \\le 0$, $c_{min}[n] = 0$. This demonstrates that the zero inside the unit circle contributes to the positive-quefrency coefficients of the cepstrum.\n\nNext, consider the term associated with the zero outside the unit circle, $z=\\alpha$. This is the maximum-phase component.\n$$C_{max}(z) = \\ln\\left(1 - \\alpha z^{-1}\\right)$$\nTo use the given power-series identity, we need an argument with magnitude less than $1$ in the annulus of convergence $\\alpha^{-1} < |z| < \\alpha$. In this region, $|\\alpha z^{-1}| > 1$, so a direct expansion in powers of $\\alpha z^{-1}$ is not valid. Instead, we must use an expansion that converges for $|z| < \\alpha$. This requires rewriting the expression:\n$$1 - \\alpha z^{-1} = -\\alpha z^{-1} \\left(1 - \\alpha^{-1} z\\right)$$\nThe logarithm becomes $C_{max}(z) = \\ln(-\\alpha z^{-1}) + \\ln(1 - \\alpha^{-1} z)$. The term $\\ln(-\\alpha z^{-1})$ contributes to $c[0]$ and can introduce a linear phase component which is handled by the formal definition of the complex cepstrum phase unwrapping. For finding $c[n]$ where $n \\neq 0$, we consider the series expansion of the term $\\ln(1 - \\alpha^{-1} z)$.\nLet $u = \\alpha^{-1} z$. The condition for convergence, $|u| < 1$, becomes $|\\alpha^{-1} z| < 1$, or $|z| < \\alpha$. This region of convergence includes the unit circle. The series expansion is:\n$$\\ln(1 - \\alpha^{-1} z) = -\\sum_{k=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{\\left(\\alpha^{-1} z\\right)^{k}}{k} = -\\sum_{k=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{\\alpha^{-k}}{k} z^{k}$$\nThis is a series in positive powers of $z$, corresponding to an anti-causal sequence. We match this to the negative-quefrency part of the Laurent series for $C_{max}(z) = \\sum_{n=-\\infty}^{-1} c_{max}[n] z^{-n}$. Let $n = -k$, so $k = -n$. The series can be rewritten as:\n$$-\\sum_{n=-1}^{-\\infty} \\frac{\\alpha^{n}}{-n} z^{-n} = \\sum_{n=-\\infty}^{-1} \\frac{\\alpha^{n}}{n} z^{-n}$$\nBy comparing coefficients, we find the contribution to negative quefrencies ($n < 0$):\n$$c_{max}[n] = \\frac{\\alpha^{n}}{n} \\quad \\text{for } n \\le -1$$\nFor $n \\ge 0$, $c_{max}[n] = 0$. This demonstrates that the zero outside the unit circle contributes to the negative-quefrency coefficients.\n\nCombining the results, the total complex cepstrum $c[n] = c_{min}[n] + c_{max}[n]$ for $n \\neq 0$ is:\n$$\nc[n] = \n\\begin{cases} \n-\\dfrac{\\alpha^{-n}}{n} & n > 0 \\\\\n\\dfrac{\\alpha^{n}}{n} & n < 0 \n\\end{cases}\n$$\n\n(b) Verification of symmetry.\n\nWe are asked to verify the symmetry arising from the reciprocal zero pair $\\{\\alpha, \\alpha^{-1}\\}$.

The process involves cepstral analysis and homomorphic filtering.\n\nFirst, we must establish the relationship between the real cepstrum $c_r[n]$ and the complex cepstrum $c[n]$ for a real, minimum-phase signal. The complex cepstrum $c[n]$ is defined as the inverse Discrete-Time Fourier Transform (IDTFT) of the complex logarithm of the signal's spectrum, $\\hat{X}(\\exp(j\\omega)) = \\ln(X(\\exp(j\\omega)))$.

The real cepstrum $c_r[n]$ is the even part of the complex cepstrum $c[n]$. That is, $c_r[n] = \\frac{c[n] + c[-n]}{2}$.\n\nThe condition that the signal $x[n]$ is minimum-phase implies that its complex cepstrum $c[n]$ is causal, meaning $c[n] = 0$ for all $n < 0$. This causality constraint allows for the unique reconstruction of $c[n]$ from $c_r[n]$:\nFor $n=0$: $c_r[0] = \\frac{c[0] + c[0]}{2} = c[0]$. Thus, $c[0] = c_r[0]$.\nFor $n>0$: $c_r[n] = \\frac{c[n] + c[-n]}{2}$. Since $n>0$, $-n<0$, and causality implies $c[-n]=0$. Therefore, $c_r[n] = \\frac{c[n]}{2}$, which gives $c[n] = 2c_r[n]$.\nFor $n<0$: $c[n]=0$ by the minimum-phase (causality) condition.\n\nSo, the complex cepstrum $c[n]$ is constructed as follows:\n$$\nc[n] = \n\\begin{cases}\nc_r[0], & n=0 \\\\\n2c_r[n], & n>0 \\\\\n0, & n<0\n\\end{cases}\n$$\n\nThe problem provides the real cepstrum:\n$$\nc_{r}[n] = \n\\begin{cases}\n\\ln 3, & n=0,\\\\\n1, & n=1 \\text{ or } n=-1,\\\\\n0, & \\text{otherwise}.\n\\end{cases}\n$$\n\nUsing the reconstruction formula, we find the complex cepstrum $c[n]$:\nFor $n=0$: $c[0] = c_r[0] = \\ln 3$.\nFor $n=1$: $c[1] = 2c_r[1] = 2(1) = 2$.\nFor $n > 1$: $c_r[n]=0$, so $c[n] = 2(0) = 0$.\nFor $n<0$: $c[n]=0$.\n\nThus, the complex cepstrum $c[n]$ is a finite-length sequence:\n$$\nc[n] = \n\\begin{cases}\n\\ln 3, & n=0 \\\\\n2, & n=1 \\\\\n0, & \\text{otherwise}\n\\end{cases}\n$$\n\nThe next step is to find the $z$-transform of the complex cepstrum, denoted $\\hat{X}(z)$.\n$$\n\\hat{X}(z) = \\sum_{n=-\\infty}^{\\infty} c[n] z^{-n} = c[0] z^0 + c[1] z^{-1} = \\ln 3 + 2z^{-1}\n$$\n\nAccording to the theory of homomorphic filtering, the $z$-transform of the signal, $X(z)$, is the exponential of $\\hat{X}(z)$:\n$$\nX(z) = \\exp(\\hat{X}(z)) = \\exp(\\ln 3 + 2z^{-1})\n$$\nUsing the property of the exponential function $\\exp(a+b) = \\exp(a)\\exp(b)$, we get:\n$$\nX(z) = \\exp(\\ln 3) \\cdot \\exp(2z^{-1}) = 3\\exp(2z^{-1})\n$$\n\nTo find the time-domain signal $x[n]$, we must compute the inverse $z$-transform of $X(z)$.
