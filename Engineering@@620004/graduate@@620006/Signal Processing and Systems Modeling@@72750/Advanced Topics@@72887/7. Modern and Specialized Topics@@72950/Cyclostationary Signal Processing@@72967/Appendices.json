The problem uses the uncentered autocorrelation $R_x(t,\\tau)=R_{0}(\\tau)\\left[1+\\beta\\cos\\!\\left(2\\pi\\cdot 2 f_{0}\\, t\\right)\\right]$, where the dependency on $t$ is explicit. The cyclic frequencies $\\alpha$ are the frequencies for which the Fourier series coefficients of these periodic functions of $t$ are nonzero.\n\nFirst, we analyze the first-order cyclic statistics derived from the mean function $m_x(t)$. The set of first-order cyclic frequencies is the support set of the cyclic mean, which is the Fourier series of $m_x(t)$. The cyclic mean $M_x(\\alpha)$ is defined as:\n$$M_x(\\alpha) \\triangleq \\lim_{T \\to \\infty} \\frac{1}{T} \\int_{-T/2}^{T/2} m_x(t) \\exp(-j 2\\pi \\alpha t) dt$$\nThe given mean is $m_x(t) = A\\cos(2\\pi f_0 t)$. This function is periodic in $t$ with fundamental period $T_m = 1/f_0$. Using Euler's identity, we express $m_x(t)$ as a sum of complex exponentials:\n$$m_x(t) = A \\left( \\frac{\\exp(j 2\\pi f_0 t) + \\exp(-j 2\\pi f_0 t)}{2} \\right) = \\frac{A}{2} \\exp(j 2\\pi f_0 t) + \\frac{A}{2} \\exp(-j 2\\pi f_0 t)$$\nThis expression is the Fourier series of $m_x(t)$. By direct inspection, the Fourier coefficients $M_x(\\alpha)$ are nonzero only for $\\alpha = f_0$ and $\\alpha = -f_0$, assuming the constant $A$ is nonzero. The coefficients are $M_x(f_0) = A/2$ and $M_x(-f_0) = A/2$. Thus, the set of first-order cyclic frequencies is $\\mathcal{A}_1 = \\{-f_0, f_0\\}$.\n\nSecond, we analyze the second-order cyclic statistics derived from the autocorrelation function $R_x(t, \\tau)$. The set of second-order cyclic frequencies is the support set of the cyclic autocorrelation function, which is the Fourier series of $R_x(t, \\tau)$ with respect to $t$. The cyclic autocorrelation $R_x^{\\alpha}(\\tau)$ is defined as:\n$$R_x^{\\alpha}(\\tau) \\triangleq \\lim_{T \\to \\infty} \\frac{1}{T} \\int_{-T/2}^{T/2} R_x(t, \\tau) \\exp(-j 2\\pi \\alpha t) dt$$\nThe given autocorrelation is $R_x(t, \\tau) = R_0(\\tau)[1 + \\beta\\cos(2\\pi \\cdot 2f_0 t)]$. This function is periodic in $t$ with a fundamental period of $T_R = 1/(2f_0)$. We again use Euler's identity:\n$$R_x(t, \\tau) = R_0(\\tau) \\left[ 1 + \\beta \\left( \\frac{\\exp(j 2\\pi (2f_0) t) + \\exp(-j 2\\pi (2f_0) t)}{2} \\right) \\right]$$\n$$R_x(t, \\tau) = R_0(\\tau) + \\frac{\\beta R_0(\\tau)}{2} \\exp(j 4\\pi f_0 t) + \\frac{\\beta R_0(\\tau)}{2} \\exp(-j 4\\pi f_0 t)$$\nThis is the Fourier series representation of $R_x(t, \\tau)$ in the variable $t$. The coefficients $R_x^{\\alpha}(\\tau)$ are nonzero for $\\alpha = 0$, $\\alpha = 2f_0$, and $\\alpha = -2f_0$, provided that $\\beta \\neq 0$ and $R_0(\\tau)$ is not identically zero. The coefficients are:\n$$R_x^{0}(\\tau) = R_0(\\tau)$$\n$$R_x^{2f_0}(\\tau) = \\frac{\\beta R_0(\\tau)}{2}$$\n$$R_x^{-2f_0}(\\tau) = \\frac{\\beta R_0(\\tau)}{2}$$\nThe presence of a nonzero component at $\\alpha=0$ corresponds to the stationary part of the process. Assuming a non-trivial process, the set of second-order cyclic frequencies is $\\mathcal{A}_2 = \\{-2f_0, 0, 2f_0\\}$.\n\nThe complete set of first-order and second-order cyclic frequencies is the union $\\mathcal{A} = \\mathcal{A}_1 \\cup \\mathcal{A}_2$.\n$$\\mathcal{A} = \\{-f_0, f_0\\} \\cup \\{-2f_0, 0, 2f_0\\} = \\{-2f_0, -f_0, 0, f_0, 2f_0\\}$$\n\nTo justify that $x(t)$ is WSCS, we must demonstrate that $m_x(t)$ and $R_x(t, \\tau)$ are periodic in $t$ with a common period. We have established that $m_x(t)$ is periodic with period $T_m = 1/f_0$, and $R_x(t, \\tau)$ is periodic in $t$ with period $T_R = 1/(2f_0)$. A common period $T_0$ must be an integer multiple of both $T_m$ and $T_R$. $T_0 = n_1 T_m = n_1/f_0$ and $T_0 = n_2 T_R = n_2/(2f_0)$ for some positive integers $n_1, n_2$. This requires $2n_1=n_2$. The smallest positive integers are $n_1=1$ and $n_2=2$, which yields the least common period $T_0 = 1/f_0$. Since both the mean and the autocorrelation function are periodic in $t$ with the common period $T_0=1/f_0$, the process $x(t)$ is, by definition, wide-sense cyclostationary of order up to two.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} -2f_{0} & -f_{0} & 0 & f_{0} & 2f_{0} \\end{pmatrix}}$$", "id": "2862566"}, {"introduction": "One of the most powerful applications of cyclostationary signal processing is its ability to detect signals buried in noise.
