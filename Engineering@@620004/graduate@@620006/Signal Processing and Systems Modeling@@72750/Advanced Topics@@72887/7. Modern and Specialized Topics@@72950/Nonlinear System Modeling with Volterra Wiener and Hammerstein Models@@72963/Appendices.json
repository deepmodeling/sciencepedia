The problem statement defines $y_m[n]$ as:\n$$ y_{m}[n] = \\sum_{k_{1}=0}^{\\infty} \\cdots \\sum_{k_{m}=0}^{\\infty} h_{m}[k_{1}, \\ldots, k_{m}] \\prod_{j=1}^{m} x[n-k_{j}] $$\nThe kernels $h_{m}[k_{1}, \\ldots, k_{m}]$ are given to be symmetric in their arguments and causal, which implies $h_{m}[k_{1}, \\ldots, k_{m}] = 0$ if any index $k_{j} < 0$. This is consistent with the summation lower bounds of $0$.\n\nThe specified input to the system is the unit sample, or Kronecker delta function, $x[n] = \\delta[n]$. This function has the property that $\\delta[k] = 1$ for $k=0$ and $\\delta[k] = 0$ for $k \\neq 0$.\n\nWe substitute this input into the expression for $y_{m}[n]$:\n$$ y_{m}[n] = \\sum_{k_{1}=0}^{\\infty} \\cdots \\sum_{k_{m}=0}^{\\infty} h_{m}[k_{1}, \\ldots, k_{m}] \\prod_{j=1}^{m} \\delta[n-k_{j}] $$\nLet us analyze the product term $\\prod_{j=1}^{m} \\delta[n-k_{j}]$. For this product to be non-zero, every term in the product must be non-zero. Since $\\delta[k]$ is non-zero only at $k=0$, we require that the argument of each Kronecker delta function in the product is equal to zero simultaneously. This imposes the following set of conditions on the summation indices $k_{1}, \\ldots, k_{m}$:\n$$ n-k_{1} = 0 \\implies k_{1} = n $$\n$$ n-k_{2} = 0 \\implies k_{2} = n $$\n$$ \\vdots $$\n$$ n-k_{m} = 0 \\implies k_{m} = n $$\nTherefore, the product term is equal to $1$ if and only if $k_{1} = k_{2} = \\cdots = k_{m} = n$. For any other combination of a set of indices $\\{k_j\\}$, the product is zero.\n$$ \\prod_{j=1}^{m} \\delta[n-k_{j}] = \\begin{cases} 1 & \\text{if } k_{1} = k_{2} = \\cdots = k_{m} = n \\\\ 0 & \\text{otherwise} \\end{cases} $$\nThis property is known as the sifting property. When this product is used within the multi-dimensional summation, it sifts out a single term from the sum. The summations over $k_1, \\ldots, k_m$ collapse, and the only term that survives is the one where all indices are equal to $n$.\n\nSubstituting this result back into the expression for $y_{m}[n]$ yields:\n$$ y_{m}[n] = h_{m}[n, n, \\ldots, n] $$\nThis expression is valid for all integers $n$. If $n < 0$, then at least one argument of the kernel is negative.

For each time index $n \\geq 0$, the value $y[n]$ is the sum of the constant offset $h_0$ and the diagonal elements of all kernels, from order $m=1$ to $m=P$, evaluated at that index $n$. Specifically, $y[n] - h_0 = h_1[n] + h_2[n, n] + \\dots + h_P[n, \\dots, n]$. The constant term $h_0$ itself is revealed as the steady-state value of the response, i.e., $y[n]$ for $n$ larger than the support of all kernels. Fundamentally, the impulse response test probes the system along the main diagonals of its multi-dimensional kernels.\n\n2.  **What is not revealed:** The shortcomings of the unit impulse as a test signal for a nonlinear system are significant.\n    *   Firstly, from a single measurement using $x[n]=\\delta[n]$, one obtains only the *sum* of the diagonal elements, $\\sum_{m=1}^{P} h_{m}[n, \\ldots, n]$, for each $n$. It is impossible to separate the individual contributions $h_{1}[n]$, $h_{2}[n,n]$, etc., from this single experiment. To achieve such a separation, one must apply impulses of varying amplitudes, e.g., $x[n]=A\\delta[n]$, and analyze the output's polynomial dependence on $A$.\n    *   Secondly, and most critically, the test reveals absolutely nothing about the **off-diagonal** elements of the kernels. An off-diagonal element is any value $h_{m}[k_{1}, \\ldots, k_{m}]$ where the indices $k_j$ are not all identical. The sifting property of the impulse product $\\prod_{j=1}^{m} \\delta[n-k_{j}]$ ensures that the system's response is evaluated only at points where $k_{1} = \\cdots = k_{m} = n$. Consequently, the vast majority of the values that define the kernels remain completely unexcited and unobserved. The given symmetry property of the kernels ($h_{m}[k_{1}, \\ldots, k_{m}]$ is invariant to permutation of its arguments) is a standard condition for ensuring a unique kernel representation but provides no mechanism to infer off-diagonal values from the diagonal ones.

Explicitly, the distinct angular frequencies generated are:\n$0$ (DC), $\\omega_{1}$, $\\omega_{2}$, $2\\omega_{1}$, $2\\omega_{2}$, $|\\omega_{1}-\\omega_{2}|$, $\\omega_{1}+\\omega_{2}$, $3\\omega_{1}$, $3\\omega_{2}$, $|2\\omega_{1}-\\omega_{2}|$, $2\\omega_{1}+\\omega_{2}$, $|\\omega_{1}-2\\omega_{2}|$, and $\\omega_{1}+2\\omega_{2}$.\n\nCombining all terms, the final expression for $y[n]$ is a sum of cosines. The terms at $\\omega_{1}$ and $\\omega_{2}$ receive contributions from both the first and third order parts of the series. All other frequency components are generated exclusively by either the second or third order term.\n\nThe complete expression is constructed by summing the components:\n- DC term from $y_{2}[n]$.\n- $\\omega_{1}$ term from $y_{1}[n]$ and $y_{3}[n]$.\n- $\\omega_{2}$ term from $y_{1}[n]$ and $y_{3}[n]$.\n- All other harmonic and intermodulation terms from $y_{2}[n]$ or $y_{3}[n]$ exclusively.\nThe final closed-form expression is assembled below.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{aligned}\n&(\\beta_{0} + \\beta_{1})\\frac{A^{2}+B^{2}}{2} \\\\\n&+ \\left( A\\alpha_{0} + \\frac{3\\gamma A}{4}(A^{2}+2B^{2}) \\right) \\cos(\\omega_{1} n) + A\\alpha_{1} \\cos(\\omega_{1} n - \\omega_{1}) \\\\\n&+ \\left( B\\alpha_{0} + \\frac{3\\gamma B}{4}(B^{2}+2A^{2}) \\right) \\cos(\\omega_{2} n) + B\\alpha_{1} \\cos(\\omega_{2} n - \\omega_{2}) \\\\\n&+ \\frac{A^{2}}{2}\\left( \\beta_{0}\\cos(2\\omega_{1} n) + \\beta_{1}\\cos(2\\omega_{1} n - 2\\omega_{1}) \\right) \\\\\n&+ \\frac{B^{2}}{2}\\left( \\beta_{0}\\cos(2\\omega_{2} n) + \\beta_{1}\\cos(2\\omega_{2} n - 2\\omega_{2}) \\right) \\\\\n&+ AB\\left( \\beta_{0}\\cos((\\omega_{1}-\\omega_{2})n) + \\beta_{1}\\cos((\\omega_{1}-\\omega_{2})n - (\\omega_{1}-\\omega_{2})) \\right) \\\\\n&+ AB\\left( \\beta_{0}\\cos((\\omega_{1}+\\omega_{2})n) + \\beta_{1}\\cos((\\omega_{1}+\\omega_{2})n - (\\omega_{1}+\\omega_{2})) \\right) \\\\\n&+ \\frac{\\gamma A^{3}}{4}\\cos(3\\omega_{1} n) + \\frac{\\gamma B^{3}}{4}\\cos(3\\omega_{2} n) \\\\\n&+ \\frac{3\\gamma A^{2} B}{4}\\cos((2\\omega_{1}-\\omega_{2})n) + \\frac{3\\gamma A^{2} B}{4}\\cos((2\\omega_{1}+\\omega_{2})n) \\\\\n&+ \\frac{3\\gamma AB^{2}}{4}\\cos((\\omega_{1}-2\\omega_{2})n) + \\frac{3\\gamma AB^{2}}{4}\\cos((\\omega_{1}+2\\omega_{2})n)\n\\end{aligned}\n}\n$$", "id": "2887101"}]}
