It is a well-defined and scientifically sound exercise in signal processing theory. A rigorous solution shall be provided.\n\nThe problem requires the derivation of a causal, stable, minimum-phase spectral factor $H(z)$ for a given power spectral density $S(z)$. The relationship between the PSD and the filter transfer function $H(z)$ is given by $S(z) = H(z)H^*(1/z^*)$, where the input is unit-variance white noise. Since the filter coefficients are real, $H^*(z) = H(z^*)$, and the relation simplifies to $S(z) = H(z)H(z^{-1})$ on the unit circle $z=e^{j\\omega}$.\n\nThe given PSD is\n$$\nS(z) = \\frac{(1+0.5\\,z^{-1})(1+0.5\\,z)}{(1-0.8\\,z^{-1})(1-0.8\\,z)}\n$$\nWe must decompose $S(z)$ into its constituent parts to construct $H(z)$.\n\nFirst, let us identify the poles and zeros of $S(z)$.\nThe zeros of $S(z)$ are the roots of the numerator polynomial, given by the product of two factors:\n$1. \\quad 1+0.5z^{-1}=0 \\implies z = -0.5$. This zero is located inside the unit circle, $|z|<1$.\n$2. \\quad 1+0.5z=0 \\implies z = -2$. This zero is located outside the unit circle, $|z|>1$.\nThe zeros of $S(z)$ are at $\\{-0.5, -2\\}$.\n\nThe poles of $S(z)$ are the roots of the denominator polynomial, given by the product of two factors:\n$1. \\quad 1-0.8z^{-1}=0 \\implies z = 0.8$. This pole is located inside the unit circle, $|z|<1$.\n$2. \\quad 1-0.8z=0 \\implies z = \\frac{1}{0.8} = 1.25$. This pole is located outside the unit circle, $|z|>1$.\nThe poles of $S(z)$ are at $\\{0.8, 1.25\\}$.\n\nThe problem requires the filter $H(z)$ to satisfy three conditions:\n$1.$ **Causality and Stability**: For a rational LTI filter, this requires that all of its poles lie strictly inside the unit circle.\n$2.$ **Minimum Phase**: This requires that all of its zeros lie strictly inside the unit circle.\n$3.$ **Real Coefficients**: This is satisfied by constructing $H(z)$ with real coefficients.\n\nTo construct $H(z)$, we must select the appropriate poles and zeros from the set of poles and zeros of $S(z)$.\n- For $H(z)$ to be stable, we must choose the pole that lies inside the unit circle. From the set of poles $\\{0.8, 1.25\\}$, we must select the pole at $z=0.8$. The corresponding term in the denominator of $H(z)$ is $(1-0.8z^{-1})$.\n- For $H(z)$ to be minimum-phase, we must choose the zero that lies inside the unit circle. From the set of zeros $\\{-0.5, -2\\}$, we must select the zero at $z=-0.5$. The corresponding term in the numerator of $H(z)$ is $(1+0.5z^{-1})$.\n\nCombining these factors, we form the transfer function $H(z)$ up to a gain constant $k$:\n$$\nH(z) = k \\frac{1+0.5z^{-1}}{1-0.8z^{-1}}\n$$\nTo determine the value of $k$, we use the factorization identity $S(z) = H(z)H(z^{-1})$ (for real coefficients).\n$$\nH(z)H(z^{-1}) = \\left( k \\frac{1+0.5z^{-1}}{1-0.8z^{-1}} \\right) \\left( k \\frac{1+0.5(z^{-1})^{-1}}{1-0.8(z^{-1})^{-1}} \\right) = k^2 \\frac{(1+0.5z^{-1})(1+0.5z)}{(1-0.8z^{-1})(1-0.8z)}\n$$\nComparing this expression with the given $S(z)$, we see that $k^2 = 1$. Since the filter coefficients are real, $k$ must be a real number, so $k=\\pm 1$. By convention, we select the positive gain, $k=1$.\nTherefore, the causal, stable, minimum-phase spectral factor is:\n$$\nH(z) = \\frac{1+0.5z^{-1}}{1-0.8z^{-1}}\n$$\nThis derivation also serves as the justification for the selection of poles and zeros. The pole at $z=0.8$ ensures stability, while the zero at $z=-0.5$ ensures the minimum-phase property. The rejected pole at $z=1.25$ and zero at $z=-2$ correspond to an anti-causal/unstable filter and a non-minimum-phase component, respectively. These are collected in the $H(z^{-1})$ factor: $H(z^{-1}) = \\frac{1+0.5z}{1-0.8z}$.\n\nFinally, we must verify the identity $S(e^{j\\omega}) = |H(e^{j\\omega})|^2$ and discuss the numerical discrepancy.\nLet us first establish the identity analytically. For $z=e^{j\\omega}$, we have $z^{-1}=e^{-j\\omega}$.\nThe PSD is:\n$$\nS(e^{j\\omega}) = \\frac{(1+0.5 e^{-j\\omega})(1+0.5 e^{j\\omega})}{(1-0.8 e^{-j\\omega})(1-0.8 e^{j\\omega})} = \\frac{1 + 0.5(e^{j\\omega}+e^{-j\\omega}) + 0.25}{1 - 0.8(e^{j\\omega}+e^{-j\\omega}) + 0.64}\n$$\nUsing the identity $e^{j\\omega}+e^{-j\\omega} = 2\\cos(\\omega)$, we get:\n$$\nS(e^{j\\omega}) = \\frac{1 + \\cos(\\omega) + 0.25}{1 - 1.6\\cos(\\omega) + 0.64} = \\frac{1.25 + \\cos(\\omega)}{1.64 - 1.6\\cos(\\omega)}\n$$\nNow we compute the squared magnitude of $H(e^{j\\omega})$:\n$$\n|H(e^{j\\omega})|^2 = \\left| \\frac{1+0.5e^{-j\\omega}}{1-0.8e^{-j\\omega}} \\right|^2 = \\frac{|1+0.5e^{-j\\omega}|^2}{|1-0.8e^{-j\\omega}|^2}\n$$\nThe squared magnitude of the numerator is:\n$$\n|1+0.5e^{-j\\omega}|^2 = (1+0.5\\cos(\\omega) - 0.5j\\sin(\\omega))(1+0.5\\cos(\\omega) + 0.5j\\sin(\\omega)) = (1+0.5\\cos(\\omega))^2 + (0.5\\sin(\\omega))^2\n$$\n$$\n= 1 + \\cos(\\omega) + 0.25\\cos^2(\\omega) + 0.25\\sin^2(\\omega) = 1 + \\cos(\\omega) + 0.25(1) = 1.25 + \\cos(\\omega)\n$$\nThe squared magnitude of the denominator is:\n$$\n|1-0.8e^{-j\\omega}|^2 = (1-0.8\\cos(\\omega) + 0.8j\\sin(\\omega))(1-0.8\\cos(\\omega) - 0.8j\\sin(\\omega)) = (1-0.8\\cos(\\omega))^2 + (0.8\\sin(\\omega))^2\n$$\n$$\n= 1 - 1.6\\cos(\\omega) + 0.64\\cos^2(\\omega) + 0.64\\sin^2(\\omega) = 1 - 1.6\\cos(\\omega) + 0.64(1) = 1.64 - 1.6\\cos(\\omega)\n$$\nThus,\n$$\n|H(e^{j\\omega})|^2 = \\frac{1.25 + \\cos(\\omega)}{1.64 - 1.6\\cos(\\omega)}\n$$\nThis is analytically identical to the expression for $S(e^{j\\omega})$.\n\nRegarding the numerical verification on the grid $\\omega_k$ for $k=0, \\dots, 15$, the maximum absolute discrepancy, $\\max_{k}\\left|S(e^{j\\omega_{k}}) - |H(e^{j\\omega_{k}})|^2\\right|$, is theoretically zero because we have proven the analytical equivalence of the two expressions. In any practical numerical computation implemented on a digital computer, the values of $S(e^{j\\omega_{k}})$ and $|H(e^{j\\omega_{k}})|^2$ would be calculated using finite-precision floating-point arithmetic. This will introduce small round-off errors in the evaluation of trigonometric functions, additions, multiplications, and divisions. Therefore, the computed discrepancy will not be exactly zero but a small value on the order of machine epsilon, which represents the limit of the computer's arithmetic precision. Any observed non-zero discrepancy is an artifact of computation, not a flaw in the underlying mathematical identity.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\frac{1+0.5z^{-1}}{1-0.8z^{-1}}}\n$$", "id": "2906384"}, {"introduction": "Having mastered the standard case, we now explore a critical boundary condition: a system with a zero on the unit circle.

The problem directs us to find the PSD $S_{yy}(e^{j\\omega})$ by taking the limit of $S_{\\rho}(e^{j\\omega})$ as $\\rho \\to 1^{-}$.\n\nThe first principle of spectral factorization is to relate the PSD, which is a function on the unit circle in the complex plane, to the z-transform of the autocorrelation sequence, $S(z)$. We use the substitution for the cosine function based on Euler's identity: $\\cos\\omega = \\frac{1}{2}(e^{j\\omega} + e^{-j\\omega})$. On the unit circle, we let $z = e^{j\\omega}$, which implies $z^{-1} = e^{-j\\omega}$.\n\nSubstituting this into the expression for $S_{\\rho}(e^{j\\omega})$ allows us to find the corresponding rational function $S_{\\rho}(z)$:\n$$S_{\\rho}(z) = 1 - 2\\rho\\left(\\frac{z + z^{-1}}{2}\\right) + \\rho^2$$\n$$S_{\\rho}(z) = 1 - \\rho(z + z^{-1}) + \\rho^2 = 1 - \\rho z - \\rho z^{-1} + \\rho^2$$\nThis Laurent polynomial in $z$ can be factored by inspection into:\n$$S_{\\rho}(z) = (1 - \\rho z)(1 - \\rho z^{-1})$$\nExpanding this product confirms the equality: $(1 - \\rho z)(1 - \\rho z^{-1}) = 1 - \\rho z^{-1} - \\rho z + \\rho^2 = 1 - \\rho(z+z^{-1}) + \\rho^2$. The factorization is correct.\n\nNow, we take the limit as $\\rho \\to 1^{-}$ to find the PSD of the process $y[n]$, denoted $S_{yy}(z)$:\n$$S_{yy}(z) = \\lim_{\\rho \\to 1^{-}} S_{\\rho}(z) = \\lim_{\\rho \\to 1^{-}} (1 - \\rho z)(1 - \\rho z^{-1})$$\n$$S_{yy}(z) = (1 - z)(1 - z^{-1})$$\nThe process $y[n]$ is the output of a causal, linear time-invariant (LTI) filter $H(z)$ driven by unit-variance white noise. For such a system, the output PSD is related to the filter's transfer function by $S_{yy}(z) = H(z)H(z^{-1})$ (for real-coefficient systems).\n\nWe have the factorization $S_{yy}(z) = (1 - z)(1 - z^{-1})$. We must identify a causal spectral factor $H(z)$. A causal filter has an impulse response $h[n]$ that is zero for $n<0$. The z-transform of a causal sequence is a power series in $z^{-1}$.\nFrom our factorization, we have two polynomial factors: $F_1(z) = 1 - z$ and $F_2(z) = 1 - z^{-1}$.\nThe factor $F_1(z) = 1-z$ corresponds to an impulse response $\\delta[n] - \\delta[n+1]$, which is anti-causal.\nThe factor $F_2(z) = 1-z^{-1}$ corresponds to an impulse response $\\delta[n] - \\delta[n-1]$, which is causal.\nTherefore, to satisfy the causality constraint, we must choose $H(z) = 1 - z^{-1}$. We could also choose $H(z) = -(1-z^{-1})$, but the simpler positive form is sufficient.\n\nThis chosen $H(z) = 1 - z^{-1}$ has a zero at $z=1$, which lies on the unit circle as required by the problem statement.\n\nNext, we analyze the stability of $H(z)$ and its inverse.\nFor the filter $H(z) = 1 - z^{-1}$:\nThis is a Finite Impulse Response (FIR) filter. Its impulse response is $h[n] = \\delta[n] - \\delta[n-1]$. A system is Bounded-Input Bounded-Output (BIBO) stable if and only if its impulse response is absolutely summable, i.e., $\\sum_{n=-\\infty}^{\\infty} |h[n]| < \\infty$.\nFor our chosen filter, the sum is:\n$$\\sum_{n=-\\infty}^{\\infty} |h[n]| = |h[0]| + |h[1]| = |1| + |-1| = 2$$\nSince $2 < \\infty$, the filter $H(z)$ is BIBO stable. Alternatively, a causal LTI system is stable if and only if all its poles are strictly inside the unit circle. $H(z) = 1 - z^{-1} = \\frac{z-1}{z}$. This system has one pole at $z=0$, which is inside the unit circle. Thus, it is stable.\n\nFor the inverse filter, $H_{inv}(z)$:\n$$H_{inv}(z) = \\frac{1}{H(z)} = \\frac{1}{1 - z^{-1}}$$\nThe pole of the inverse filter is located where the original filter had a zero, which is at $z=1$.\nFor the inverse filter to be causal, its Region of Convergence (ROC) must be outside the outermost pole. Here, the ROC must be $|z| > 1$.\nA system is BIBO stable if and only if its ROC includes the unit circle. The ROC for the causal inverse, $|z|>1$, does not include the unit circle. Therefore, the causal inverse system is not BIBO stable.\nWe can verify this by examining the impulse response of the causal inverse. The inverse z-transform of $\\frac{1}{1 - z^{-1}}$ for the ROC $|z|>1$ is the unit step function, $h_{inv}[n] = u[n]$.\nThe sum of its absolute values is:\n$$\\sum_{n=-\\infty}^{\\infty} |h_{inv}[n]| = \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} |u[n]| = \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} 1 \\to \\infty$$\nThe sum diverges, confirming that the causal inverse filter is not BIBO stable. The existence of a zero on the unit circle for the original filter $H(z)$ precludes the existence of a stable and causal inverse.\n\nThe problem asks for the explicit closed-form expression for the causal spectral factor $H(z)$.

The condition that $W(\\infty)$ is upper triangular with positive real diagonal entries forces $U$ to be the identity, since $W_{1}(\\infty) U$ must remain upper triangular with strictly positive real diagonal entries; the only constant unitary satisfying this is the identity. Hence the factor above is unique under the stated normalization.\n\nTherefore, the upper-right entry of the normalized minimum-phase right spectral factor is\n$$\nB(z) \\,=\\, 0.3\\,z^{-1}.\n$$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.3\\,z^{-1}}$$", "id": "2906402"}]}
