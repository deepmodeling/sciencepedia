It presents a standard exercise in radar signal processing concerning the ambiguity function, a central concept in the analysis of time-frequency resolution.

The equation is $1 - |\\tau|/T = 1/2$, which gives $|\\tau| = T/2$. The full width is the distance between $\\tau = -T/2$ and $\\tau = T/2$, so $W_{\\tau,R} = T$.\nThe Doppler FWHM, $W_{\\nu,R}$, is found by solving $|A_{x_{R}}(0,\\nu)| = 1/2$.\n$A_{x_{R}}(0,\\nu) = \\text{sinc}(\\nu T)$. The equation is $|\\text{sinc}(\\nu T)| = |\\frac{\\sin(\\pi\\nu T)}{\\pi\\nu T}| = 1/2$. Let $z_h$ be the smallest positive root of $\\sin(z)/z = 1/2$. Numerically, $z_h \\approx 1.89549$. This gives $|\\pi\\nu T| = z_h$, so $|\\nu| = z_h/(\\pi T)$. The full width is $W_{\\nu,R} = 2z_h/(\\pi T)$.\n\nFor the Gaussian pulse:\nThe delay FWHM, $W_{\\tau,G}$, is found from $|A_{x_{G}}(\\tau,0)| = 1/2$.\n$A_{x_{G}}(\\tau,0) = \\exp(-\\tau^2/(8\\sigma_t^2))$. The equation is $\\exp(-\\tau^2/(8\\sigma_t^2)) = 1/2$. Taking the natural logarithm gives $-\\tau^2/(8\\sigma_t^2) = -\\ln(2)$, so $\\tau^2 = 8\\sigma_t^2\\ln(2)$. This gives $|\\tau| = \\sqrt{8\\ln(2)}\\sigma_t = 2\\sqrt{2\\ln(2)}\\sigma_t$. The full width is $W_{\\tau,G} = 4\\sqrt{2\\ln(2)}\\sigma_t$.\nThe Doppler FWHM, $W_{\\nu,G}$, is found from $|A_{x_{G}}(0,\\nu)| = 1/2$.\n$A_{x_{G}}(0,\\nu) = \\exp(-2\\pi^2\\nu^2\\sigma_t^2)$. The equation is $\\exp(-2\\pi^2\\nu^2\\sigma_t^2) = 1/2$. Taking the natural logarithm gives $-2\\pi^2\\nu^2\\sigma_t^2 = -\\ln(2)$, so $\\nu^2 = \\ln(2)/(2\\pi^2\\sigma_t^2)$. This gives $|\\nu| = \\sqrt{\\ln(2)}/(\\sqrt{2}\\pi\\sigma_t)$. The full width is $W_{\\nu,G} = 2\\sqrt{\\ln(2)}/(\\sqrt{2}\\pi\\sigma_t) = \\sqrt{2\\ln(2)}/(\\pi\\sigma_t)$.\n\nNow, we compute the ambiguity footprint areas and the final ratio $R$.\nThe footprint area for the rectangular pulse is:\n$$(W_{\\tau}W_{\\nu})_{R} = W_{\\tau,R} \\cdot W_{\\nu,R} = T \\cdot \\frac{2z_h}{\\pi T} = \\frac{2z_h}{\\pi}.$$\nThe footprint area for the Gaussian pulse is:\n$$(W_{\\tau}W_{\\nu})_{G} = W_{\\tau,G} \\cdot W_{\\nu,G} = \\left(4\\sqrt{2\\ln(2)}\\sigma_t\\right) \\cdot \\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{2\\ln(2)}}{\\pi\\sigma_t}\\right) = \\frac{4(2\\ln(2))}{\\pi} = \\frac{8\\ln(2)}{\\pi}.$$\nThe ratio $R$ is therefore:\n$$R = \\frac{(W_{\\tau}W_{\\nu})_{G}}{(W_{\\tau}W_{\\nu})_{R}} = \\frac{8\\ln(2)/\\pi}{2z_h/\\pi} = \\frac{4\\ln(2)}{z_h}.$$\nSubstituting the numerical values $z_h \\approx 1.89549$ and $\\ln(2) \\approx 0.693147$:\n$$R \\approx \\frac{4 \\times 0.693147}{1.89549} \\approx 1.46277.$$\nRounding to $4$ significant figures, the result is $1.463$.\n\nFinally, a brief comparison of sidelobe behavior at $\\tau = 0$.\nThe Doppler cut of the ambiguity function for the rectangular pulse is $A_{x_R}(0, \\nu) = \\text{sinc}(\\nu T)$. The sinc function exhibits prominent sidelobes which decay slowly, proportional to $1/|\\nu|$. The first sidelobe peak is approximately $-13.5$ dB relative to the main lobe maximum.\nThe Doppler cut for the Gaussian pulse is $A_{x_G}(0, \\nu) = \\exp(-2\\pi^2\\nu^2\\sigma_t^2)$. This is a Gaussian function in the Doppler variable $\\nu$. A Gaussian function has no sidelobes; its magnitude decays monotonically and exponentially from its peak.\nConsequently, the Gaussian pulse is far superior in avoiding Doppler ambiguities, as it does not produce the spurious responses characteristic of the rectangular pulse's sidelobes.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{1.463}$$", "id": "2914727"}, {"introduction": "While the Wigner-Ville Distribution (WVD) offers excellent time-frequency localization for a single signal component, its application to real-world, multi-component signals reveals a significant challenge: the presence of interference or \"cross-terms.\" This exercise delves into the heart of this issue by analyzing a signal composed of two distinct Gaussian atoms.

The oscillatory behavior of this term determines the fringe structure.\n\nThe problem requires us to use the relationship between the WVD and the ambiguity function (AF), given by:\n$$\nW_{s}(t,f) = \\iint_{\\mathbb{R}^{2}} A_{s}(\\tau,\\nu)\\,\\exp\\left(j 2\\pi (\\nu t-\\tau f)\\right)\\,d\\tau\\,d\\nu\n$$\nLike the WVD, the AF, $A_s(\\tau, \\nu)$, is also bilinear.

For two signals $s_1(t)$ and $s_2(t)$, which are time-frequency shifts of each other, their cross-AFs are concentrated around points determined by their time and frequency separations.\nLet $s_1(t)$ be centered at $(t_1, f_1)$ and $s_2(t)$ at $(t_2, f_2)$. The cross-ambiguity function $A_{s_1,s_2}(\\tau,\\nu)$ is known to be a packet localized around the point $(\\tau, \\nu) = (-(t_2-t_1), -(f_2-f_1)) = (-\\Delta t, -\\Delta f)$. Conversely, the cross-ambiguity function $A_{s_2,s_1}(\\tau,\\nu)$ is localized around $(\\tau, \\nu) = (t_2-t_1, f_2-f_1) = (\\Delta t, \\Delta f)$. The auto-terms are localized around the origin $(0,0)$.\n\nThe problem directs us to employ a stationary phase argument. In this context, this means we analyze the contribution to the WVD integral from the regions where the amplitude of the cross-AF is significant. The Fourier transform relationship acts as a bridge: a function localized in one domain corresponds to an oscillatory function (a plane wave) in the transform domain. This is a direct consequence of the shift property of the Fourier transform. For the specific 2D transform given, a shift of the AF, $A(\\tau-\\tau_0, \\nu-\\nu_0)$, results in a phase modulation of its transform:\n$$\n\\iint A(\\tau-\\tau_0, \\nu-\\nu_0) e^{j2\\pi(\\nu t - \\tau f)} d\\tau d\\nu = e^{j2\\pi(\\nu_0 t - \\tau_0 f)} \\iint A(\\tau', \\nu') e^{j2\\pi(\\nu' t - \\tau' f)} d\\tau' d\\nu'\n$$\nWe apply this principle. The cross-AF $A_{s_1,s_2}(\\tau,\\nu)$ is a distribution peaked at $(\\tau_0, \\nu_0) = (-\\Delta t, -\\Delta f)$. Its contribution to the WVD, $W_{s_1,s_2}(t,f)$, is thus dominated by a complex exponential phase factor corresponding to this shift:\n$$\nW_{s_1,s_2}(t,f) \\propto \\exp\\left(j 2\\pi (-\\Delta f \\cdot t - (-\\Delta t) \\cdot f)\\right) = \\exp\\left(-j 2\\pi (\\Delta f t - \\Delta t f)\\right)\n$$\nSimilarly, the cross-AF $A_{s_2,s_1}(\\tau,\\nu)$ is peaked at $(\\tau_0, \\nu_0) = (\\Delta t, \\Delta f)$. Its contribution to the WVD, $W_{s_2,s_1}(t,f)$, is dominated by the corresponding phase factor:\n$$\nW_{s_2,s_1}(t,f) \\propto \\exp\\left(j 2\\pi (\\Delta f \\cdot t - \\Delta t \\cdot f)\\right)\n$$\nThe total interference term in the WVD is the sum of these two contributions. Since $A_{s_2,s_1}(\\tau,\\nu) = A_{s_1,s_2}^*(-\\tau, -\\nu)$, a property which can be derived from first principles, their integrated amplitudes are complex conjugates. Let the proportionality constant for the first term be $C e^{j\\phi}$; then for the second term, it is $C e^{-j\\phi}$. The total interference term is thus:\n$$\nI(t,f) \\approx C e^{j\\phi} \\exp\\left(-j 2\\pi (\\Delta f t - \\Delta t f)\\right) + C e^{-j\\phi} \\exp\\left(j 2\\pi (\\Delta f t - \\Delta t f)\\right)\n$$\n$$\nI(t,f) \\approx 2C \\cos\\left(2\\pi (\\Delta f t - \\Delta t f) - \\phi\\right)\n$$\nThis expression describes the interference fringes as a cosinusoidal pattern in the $(t,f)$-plane. The phase of this oscillation is $\\Phi(t,f) = 2\\pi (\\Delta f t - \\Delta t f) - \\phi$.\n\nFrom this phase function, we determine the periods of the fringes along the time and frequency axes.\nThe period along the time axis, which we denote $T_t$, is the change in $t$ which results in a $2\\pi$ change in phase, while keeping $f$ constant.\n$$\n|\\Phi(t+T_t, f) - \\Phi(t,f)| = |2\\pi \\Delta f (t+T_t) - 2\\pi \\Delta f t| = 2\\pi\n$$\n$$\n|2\\pi \\Delta f T_t| = 2\\pi\n$$\nSince period must be a positive quantity, and we are given $\\Delta f \\neq 0$, we have:\n$$\nT_t = \\frac{1}{|\\Delta f|}\n$$\nThe period along the frequency axis, which we denote $T_f$, is the change in $f$ which results in a $2\\pi$ change in phase, while keeping $t$ constant.\n$$\n|\\Phi(t, f+T_f) - \\Phi(t,f)| = |-2\\pi \\Delta t (f+T_f) - (-2\\pi \\Delta t f)| = 2\\pi\n$$\n$$\n|-2\\pi \\Delta t T_f| = 2\\pi\n$$\nSince $\\Delta t \\neq 0$, the period in frequency is:\n$$\nT_f = \\frac{1}{|\\Delta t|}\n$$\nThese expressions give the fringe periods in terms of the time and frequency separations of the two Gaussian atoms, as required.

Auto-term broadening constraint for a Gaussian auto-term: Suppose that one of the auto-terms of interest is generated by a unit-energy Gaussian-modulated complex exponential\n$$\nx(t)=\\exp\\!\\Big(-\\pi\\,\\frac{t^{2}}{\\sigma_{t}^{2}}\\Big)\\,\\exp\\!\\big(j2\\pi f_{c}t\\big),\n$$\nwith time spread parameter $\\,\\sigma_{t}>0\\,$ and carrier frequency $\\,f_{c}\\in\\mathbb{R}\\,.$ For this auto-term, define its significant ambiguity-domain region as the set\n$$\n\\mathcal{S}_{\\theta}=\\big\\{(\\tau,\\nu): |A_{x}(\\tau,\\nu)|\\ge \\theta\\big\\},\n$$\nfor a given level $\\,\\theta\\in(0,1)\\,.$ Impose the requirement that the kernel does not attenuate the auto-term within $\\,\\mathcal{S}_{\\theta}\\,$ by more than a factor $\\,\\gamma\\in(0,1)\\,$, i.e., $\\,\\Phi(\\tau,\\nu)\\ge \\gamma\\,$ for all $\\,(\\tau,\\nu)\\in\\mathcal{S}_{\\theta}\\,.$\n\nAssume that the parameters $\\,(\\varepsilon,\\theta,\\gamma,\\tau_{0},\\nu_{0})\\,$ are such that it is possible to fulfill both requirements simultaneously, and, among all feasible choices, choose the value of $\\,\\alpha\\,$ that minimizes auto-term broadening (i.e., the smallest $\\,\\alpha\\,$ that still satisfies the cross-term suppression constraint while respecting the auto-term constraint).

The signal is defined as $x(t)=\\exp(-\\pi\\,t^{2}/\\sigma_{t}^{2})\\exp(j2\\pi f_{c}t)$ with an adjustable parameter $\\sigma_t > 0$, but is also specified to be \"unit-energy\". Let us compute the energy $E_x$ of this signal:\n$$\nE_{x} = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} |x(t)|^{2} dt = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\left|\\exp\\left(-\\pi\\,\\frac{t^{2}}{\\sigma_{t}^{2}}\\right)\\right|^{2} dt = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{2\\pi t^{2}}{\\sigma_{t}^{2}}\\right) dt\n$$\nThis is a standard Gaussian integral of the form $\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\exp(-at^2)dt = \\sqrt{\\pi/a}$. Here, $a = 2\\pi/\\sigma_t^2$. The energy is:\n$$\nE_{x} = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\pi}{2\\pi/\\sigma_{t}^{2}}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\sigma_{t}^{2}}{2}} = \\frac{\\sigma_{t}}{\\sqrt{2}}\n$$\nThe condition that the signal is \"unit-energy\" means $E_x=1$, which implies $\\sigma_t/\\sqrt{2}=1$, or $\\sigma_t=\\sqrt{2}$. This contradicts the statement that $\\sigma_t$ is a parameter. However, the problem also specifies that the final answer for $\\alpha$ must not depend on $\\sigma_t$. This strongly suggests that the properties of the auto-term constraint must work out to be independent of $\\sigma_t$. Let us verify this. The constraint depends on the set $\\mathcal{S}_{\\theta}$, which is defined by $|A_x(\\tau,\\nu)| \\ge \\theta$. The ambiguity function's magnitude is $|A_x(\\tau,\\nu)| = E_x \\exp(-\\frac{\\pi}{2}(\\frac{\\tau^2}{\\sigma_t^2} + \\sigma_t^2 \\nu^2)) = \\frac{\\sigma_t}{\\sqrt{2}} \\exp(-\\frac{\\pi}{2}(\\frac{\\tau^2}{\\sigma_t^2} + \\sigma_t^2 \\nu^2))$. If we were to proceed with $\\sigma_t$ as a free parameter, the constraint would depend on it, and so would the final answer for $\\alpha$, contradicting the problem's explicit instruction. The only logical resolution is to conclude that the \"unit-energy\" property is a directive that fixes the signal's energy to $E_x=1$, which in turn fixes $\\sigma_t = \\sqrt{2}$. The description of $\\sigma_t$ as a \"parameter\" is therefore imprecise phrasing, which is disregarded in favor of the more consequential \"unit-energy\" property that makes the problem consistent. The problem is thus deemed valid under this interpretation.\n\nWe proceed to solve the constrained optimization problem. The goal is to find the minimum $\\alpha \\ge 0$ satisfying two constraints.\n\nConstraint 1: Cross-term suppression.\nThe kernel $\\Phi(\\tau,\\nu)=\\exp(-\\alpha\\,\\tau^{2}\\nu^{2})$ must satisfy $\\Phi(\\tau_{0},\\nu_{0}) \\le \\varepsilon$ at the specified point $(\\tau_0, \\nu_0)$.\n$$\n\\exp(-\\alpha\\,\\tau_{0}^{2}\\nu_{0}^{2}) \\le \\varepsilon\n$$\nSince $\\varepsilon \\in (0,1)$, its natural logarithm is negative. Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n$$\n-\\alpha\\,\\tau_{0}^{2}\\nu_{0}^{2} \\le \\ln(\\varepsilon)\n$$\nAssuming the cross-term is not located on the axes, i.e., $\\tau_0 \\neq 0$ and $\\nu_0 \\neq 0$, we can divide by $-\\tau_0^2 \\nu_0^2$. The inequality reverses:\n$$\n\\alpha \\ge -\\frac{\\ln(\\varepsilon)}{\\tau_{0}^{2}\\nu_{0}^{2}} = \\frac{\\ln(1/\\varepsilon)}{\\tau_{0}^{2}\\nu_{0}^{2}}\n$$\nThis establishes a lower bound for $\\alpha$.\n\nConstraint 2: Auto-term preservation.\nThe kernel must satisfy $\\Phi(\\tau,\\nu) \\ge \\gamma$ for all $(\\tau, \\nu)$ in the set $\\mathcal{S}_{\\theta}$. This is equivalent to:\n$$\n\\exp(-\\alpha\\,\\tau^{2}\\nu^{2}) \\ge \\gamma \\quad \\forall (\\tau, \\nu) \\in \\mathcal{S}_{\\theta}\n$$\nTaking the natural logarithm:\n$$\n-\\alpha\\,\\tau^{2}\\nu^{2} \\ge \\ln(\\gamma) \\implies \\alpha\\,\\tau^{2}\\nu^{2} \\le -\\ln(\\gamma) = \\ln(1/\\gamma)\n$$\nThis inequality must hold for all points in $\\mathcal{S}_{\\theta}$. The most stringent condition occurs at the point $(\\tau, \\nu) \\in \\mathcal{S}_{\\theta}$ where the product $\\tau^2\\nu^2$ is maximized. Let this maximum value be denoted $(\\tau^2\\nu^2)_{\\max}$. The constraint on $\\alpha$ becomes:\n$$\n\\alpha \\le \\frac{\\ln(1/\\gamma)}{(\\tau^2\\nu^2)_{\\max}}\n$$\nWe must now determine $(\\tau^2\\nu^2)_{\\max}$. The set $\\mathcal{S}_{\\theta}$ is defined by $|A_{x}(\\tau,\\nu)|\\ge \\theta$. Using the established unit-energy property ($E_x=1$), the ambiguity function magnitude for the specified Gaussian signal is:\n$$\n|A_{x}(\\tau,\\nu)| = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\left(\\frac{\\tau^2}{\\sigma_t^2} + \\sigma_t^2 \\nu^2\\right)\\right)\n$$\nThe inequality defining $\\mathcal{S}_{\\theta}$ is:\n$$\n\\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\left(\\frac{\\tau^2}{\\sigma_t^2} + \\sigma_t^2 \\nu^2\\right)\\right) \\ge \\theta \\implies -\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\left(\\frac{\\tau^2}{\\sigma_t^2} + \\sigma_t^2 \\nu^2\\right) \\ge \\ln(\\theta)\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\tau^2}{\\sigma_t^2} + \\sigma_t^2 \\nu^2 \\le -\\frac{2}{\\pi}\\ln(\\theta) = \\frac{2}{\\pi}\\ln(1/\\theta)\n$$\nWe need to maximize the function $f(\\tau, \\nu) = \\tau^2\\nu^2$ subject to the constraint that $(\\tau,\\nu)$ lies in the elliptical region defined above. Let $u=\\tau^2$ and $v=\\nu^2$. We maximize $g(u,v)=uv$ for $u,v \\ge 0$ subject to $\\frac{u}{\\sigma_t^2} + \\sigma_t^2 v \\le C$, where $C = \\frac{2}{\\pi}\\ln(1/\\theta)$. The maximum must occur on the boundary of the region, $\\frac{u}{\\sigma_t^2} + \\sigma_t^2 v = C$. From this, we express $u = \\sigma_t^2(C - \\sigma_t^2 v)$. Substituting this into $g(u,v)$:\n$$\ng(v) = \\sigma_t^2(C - \\sigma_t^2 v)v = C\\sigma_t^2 v - \\sigma_t^4 v^2\n$$\nTo find the maximum, we differentiate with respect to $v$ and set the result to zero:\n$$\n\\frac{dg}{dv} = C\\sigma_t^2 - 2\\sigma_t^4 v = 0 \\implies v = \\frac{C}{2\\sigma_t^2}\n$$\nThe corresponding value of $u$ is $u = \\sigma_t^2(C - \\sigma_t^2 \\frac{C}{2\\sigma_t^2}) = \\frac{C\\sigma_t^2}{2}$.\nThe maximum value of the product $uv$ is therefore:\n$$\n(\\tau^2\\nu^2)_{\\max} = uv = \\left(\\frac{C\\sigma_t^2}{2}\\right)\\left(\\frac{C}{2\\sigma_t^2}\\right) = \\frac{C^2}{4}\n$$\nCrucially, this maximum value is independent of the parameter $\\sigma_t$. Substituting the expression for $C$:\n$$\n(\\tau^2\\nu^2)_{\\max} = \\frac{1}{4} \\left(\\frac{2}{\\pi}\\ln(1/\\theta)\\right)^2 = \\frac{1}{\\pi^2} (\\ln(1/\\theta))^2\n$$\nNow we can write the upper bound for $\\alpha$:\n$$\n\\alpha \\le \\frac{\\ln(1/\\gamma)}{\\frac{1}{\\pi^2}(\\ln(1/\\theta))^2} = \\frac{\\pi^2 \\ln(1/\\gamma)}{(\\ln(1/\\theta))^2}\n$$\nCombining both constraints, the feasible range for $\\alpha$ is:\n$$\n\\frac{\\ln(1/\\varepsilon)}{\\tau_{0}^{2}\\nu_{0}^{2}} \\le \\alpha \\le \\frac{\\pi^2 \\ln(1/\\gamma)}{(\\ln(1/\\theta))^2}\n$$\nThe problem states to assume that parameters are such that this interval is non-empty. The objective is to find the value of $\\alpha$ that minimizes auto-term broadening, which is explicitly defined as finding \"the smallest $\\alpha$ that still satisfies the cross-term suppression constraint while respecting the auto-term constraint\". This means we must find the minimum value of $\\alpha$ within the derived feasible range.\nThe minimum value of $\\alpha$ in this interval is its lower bound.\nTherefore, the optimal choice for $\\alpha$ is:\n$$\n\\alpha_{\\text{opt}} = \\frac{\\ln(1/\\varepsilon)}{\\tau_{0}^{2}\\nu_{0}^{2}}\n$$\nThis value minimizes the kernel's smoothing effect (by being as small as possible) while precisely meeting the cross-term suppression requirement.
