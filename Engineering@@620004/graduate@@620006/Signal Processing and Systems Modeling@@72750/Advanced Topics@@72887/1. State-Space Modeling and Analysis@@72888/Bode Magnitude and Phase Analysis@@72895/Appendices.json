It is scientifically grounded in the principles of linear systems theory, well-posed with all necessary information provided, and stated objectively. The tasks are standard derivations in the field of signal processing. We shall proceed with the solution.\n\nThe transfer function of the first-order all-pass factor is given by\n$$A(s) = \\frac{s - a}{s + a}$$\nwith the condition that $a > 0$. The frequency response is found by substituting $s = j\\omega$, where $j = \\sqrt{-1}$ and $\\omega$ is the real angular frequency, with $\\omega \\ge 0$.\n$$A(j\\omega) = \\frac{j\\omega - a}{j\\omega + a}$$\n\nFirst, we prove that the Bode magnitude, $|A(j\\omega)|$, is unity for all real $\\omega$. The magnitude of a ratio of complex numbers is the ratio of their magnitudes.\n$$|A(j\\omega)| = \\left| \\frac{j\\omega - a}{j\\omega + a} \\right| = \\frac{|-a + j\\omega|}{|a + j\\omega|}$$\nThe magnitude of a complex number $x + jy$ is $\\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}$. Applying this to the numerator and denominator:\nThe magnitude of the numerator is $|-a + j\\omega| = \\sqrt{(-a)^2 + \\omega^2} = \\sqrt{a^2 + \\omega^2}$.\nThe magnitude of the denominator is $|a + j\\omega| = \\sqrt{a^2 + \\omega^2}$.\nTherefore, the Bode magnitude is the ratio of these two identical quantities:\n$$|A(j\\omega)| = \\frac{\\sqrt{a^2 + \\omega^2}}{\\sqrt{a^2 + \\omega^2}} = 1$$\nThis holds for any real value of $\\omega$. Q.E.D. Because the magnitude is constant and equal to $1$ for all frequencies, this type of filter is called an all-pass filter.\n\nNext, we derive the expression for the Bode phase, $\\phi(\\omega) = \\angle A(j\\omega)$. The phase of a ratio of complex numbers is the phase of the numerator minus the phase of the denominator.\n$$\\phi(\\omega) = \\angle(j\\omega - a) - \\angle(j\\omega + a) = \\angle(-a + j\\omega) - \\angle(a + j\\omega)$$\nThe numerator, $-a + j\\omega$, is a complex number with a negative real part (since $a>0$) and a non-negative imaginary part (since $\\omega \\ge 0$). It lies in the second quadrant of the complex plane. Its phase is given by $\\arctan(\\frac{\\omega}{-a}) + \\pi = \\pi - \\arctan(\\frac{\\omega}{a})$.\nThe denominator, $a + j\\omega$, is a complex number with a positive real part and a non-negative imaginary part. It lies in the first quadrant. Its phase is given by $\\arctan(\\frac{\\omega}{a})$.\nCombining these, the total phase is:\n$$\\phi(\\omega) = \\left( \\pi - \\arctan\\left(\\frac{\\omega}{a}\\right) \\right) - \\arctan\\left(\\frac{\\omega}{a}\\right) = \\pi - 2\\arctan\\left(\\frac{\\omega}{a}\\right)$$\nThis expression for $\\phi(\\omega)$ is continuous for all $\\omega \\ge 0$. At $\\omega = 0$, $\\phi(0) = \\pi - 2\\arctan(0) = \\pi$, which corresponds to $A(j0) = -a/a = -1$. As $\\omega \\to \\infty$, $\\phi(\\infty) \\to \\pi - 2(\\pi/2) = 0$, which corresponds to $A(j\\omega) \\to (j\\omega)/(j\\omega) = 1$. The expression is consistent with the behavior at low and high frequencies.\n\nNow, we compute the group delay, $\\tau_g(\\omega)$, which is defined as the negative derivative of the phase with respect to angular frequency.\n$$\\tau_g(\\omega) = - \\frac{d}{d\\omega} \\phi(\\omega) = - \\frac{d}{d\\omega} \\left( \\pi - 2\\arctan\\left(\\frac{\\omega}{a}\\right) \\right)$$\nThe derivative of the constant $\\pi$ is $0$. The derivative of $\\arctan(u)$ with respect to $\\omega$ is $\\frac{1}{1+u^2} \\frac{du}{d\\omega}$. In our case, $u = \\frac{\\omega}{a}$, so $\\frac{du}{d\\omega} = \\frac{1}{a}$.\n$$\\tau_g(\\omega) = - \\left( 0 - 2 \\cdot \\frac{1}{1 + \\left(\\frac{\\omega}{a}\\right)^2} \\cdot \\frac{1}{a} \\right)$$\n$$\\tau_g(\\omega) = \\frac{2}{a} \\cdot \\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{\\omega^2}{a^2}} = \\frac{2}{a} \\cdot \\frac{a^2}{a^2 + \\omega^2}$$\nSimplifying this expression gives the final form for the group delay:\n$$\\tau_g(\\omega) = \\frac{2a}{a^2 + \\omega^2}$$\n\nFinally, we interpret the frequency dependence of $\\tau_g(\\omega)$ based on the pole-zero geometry. The transfer function $A(s)$ has a zero at $s = a$ and a pole at $s = -a$. The zero is in the right half-plane (RHP) and the pole is in the left half-plane (LHP), positioned symmetrically with respect to the imaginary axis. The frequency response is evaluated along the imaginary axis, $s = j\\omega$.\nThe magnitude $|A(j\\omega)|$ is the ratio of the distance from the point $j\\omega$ to the zero at $s=a$ and the distance from $j\\omega$ to the pole at $s=-a$. Due to the symmetry, these distances are always equal, so their ratio is always $1$.\nThe phase $\\phi(\\omega)$ is the phase of the vector from the zero to $j\\omega$ minus the phase of the vector from the pole to $j\\omega$. As $\\omega$ increases from $0$ to $\\infty$, the phase from the RHP zero decreases from $\\pi$ to $\\pi/2$, while the phase from the LHP pole increases from $0$ to $\\pi/2$. The total phase, $\\phi(\\omega)$, therefore decreases monotonically from $\\pi$ to $0$.\nThe group delay, $\\tau_g(\\omega) = -d\\phi/d\\omega$, is the negative of the slope of the phase plot. Since the phase is a strictly decreasing function of $\\omega$, the group delay is always positive. The phase changes most rapidly for frequencies near the pole and zero. Since the pole and zero are on the real axis, the strongest influence is felt at frequencies near $\\omega = 0$. This is confirmed by our derived expression for $\\tau_g(\\omega) = \\frac{2a}{a^2 + \\omega^2}$, which has its maximum value of $\\frac{2}{a}$ at $\\omega = 0$ and decreases as $\\omega$ increases. The parameter $a$ determines how far the pole and zero are from the imaginary axis; a larger $a$ results in a smaller peak delay that is spread over a wider range of frequencies.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{2a}{a^{2} + \\omega^{2}}}$$", "id": "2856163"}, {"introduction": "In ideal controller design, we can place poles and zeros with perfect precision, but in reality, component tolerances make this impossible.
