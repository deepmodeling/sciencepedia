The polynomials $N(s)$ and $D(s)$ are monic and given by:\n$$N(s) = s^m + b_{m-1}s^{m-1} + \\dots + b_0 = \\prod_{i=1}^{m} (s-z_i)$$\n$$D(s) = s^n + a_{n-1}s^{n-1} + \\dots + a_0 = \\prod_{j=1}^{n} (s-p_j)$$\nHere, $\\{z_i\\}$ are the $m$ open-loop zeros and $\\{p_j\\}$ are the $n$ open-loop poles.

The asymptotes are the straight lines that these branches of the root locus approach for large values of $|s|$.\n\nThe closed-loop characteristic equation is $1 + L(s) = 0$, which can be rewritten as $D(s) + K N(s) = 0$.\n\n**1. Number of Asymptotes**\n\nFor very large $|s|$, the highest power terms of the polynomials dominate. Thus, $N(s) \\approx s^m$ and $D(s) \\approx s^n$. The characteristic equation becomes approximately:\n$$s^n + K s^m \\approx 0$$\nAssuming $s \\neq 0$, we can write:\n$$s^{n-m} \\approx -K$$\nAs the gain $K$ varies from $0$ to $\\infty$, the magnitude of the roots of this equation, $|s|$, also varies from $0$ to $\\infty$. Specifically, $|s| \\approx K^{\\frac{1}{n-m}}$. This indicates that there are $n-m$ branches of the root locus that extend to infinity. Therefore, there are $n-m$ asymptotes.\n\n**2. Angles of Asymptotes**\n\nThe root locus is defined by the angle condition: $\\arg(L(s)) = (2l+1)\\pi$ for any integer $l$.\nFor very large $|s|$, $L(s) \\approx K\\frac{s^m}{s^n} = K s^{m-n}$.\nThe angle condition becomes:\n$$\\arg(K s^{m-n}) = (2l+1)\\pi$$\nSince $K$ is a positive real number, $\\arg(K) = 0$.\n$$\\arg(s^{m-n}) = (m-n)\\arg(s) = (2l+1)\\pi$$\nThe angles $\\theta_a$ of the asymptotes are therefore given by $\\arg(s)$:\n$$\\theta_a = \\frac{(2l+1)\\pi}{m-n} = -\\frac{(2l+1)\\pi}{n-m}$$\nTo express these angles in a more conventional form (between $0$ and $2\\pi$), we can simply absorb the negative sign into the choice of integer $l$. A distinct set of $n-m$ angles is obtained by choosing $l = 0, 1, 2, \\dots, n-m-1$:\n$$\\theta_l = \\frac{(2l+1)\\pi}{n-m}, \\quad l = 0, 1, \\dots, n-m-1$$\n\n**3. Centroid (Real-Axis Intersection) of Asymptotes**\n\nTo find the point where the asymptotes intersect on the real axis, we need a better approximation of $L(s)$ for large $|s|$. We perform polynomial long division of $D(s)$ by $N(s)$, or equivalently, we find the asymptotic expansion of $D(s)/N(s)$.\n$$\\frac{D(s)}{N(s)} = \\frac{s^n + a_{n-1}s^{n-1} + \\dots}{s^m + b_{m-1}s^{m-1} + \\dots}$$\nThe first term of the quotient is $s^{n-m}$. The next term is found from the remainder:\n$$(s^n + a_{n-1}s^{n-1} + \\dots) - s^{n-m}(s^m + b_{m-1}s^{m-1} + \\dots) = (a_{n-1} - b_{m-1})s^{n-1} + \\dots$$\nDividing this remainder by $s^m$ gives the next term of the quotient, $(a_{n-1} - b_{m-1})s^{n-m-1}$.\nSo, for large $|s|$, we have the approximation:\n$$\\frac{D(s)}{N(s)} \\approx s^{n-m} + (a_{n-1} - b_{m-1})s^{n-m-1}$$\nThe characteristic equation is $D(s)/N(s) = -K$.

The sum of the roots of this *asymptotic* characteristic equation represents the sum of the $n-m$ poles that go to infinity.\nLet these asymptotic poles be $s'_1, s'_2, \\dots, s'_{n-m}$. Their sum is:\n$$\\sum_{k=1}^{n-m} s'_k = -(a_{n-1} - b_{m-1})$$\nAlso from Vieta's formulas, for the polynomials $D(s)$ and $N(s)$, we have:\n$$\\sum_{j=1}^{n} p_j = -a_{n-1} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\sum_{i=1}^{m} z_i = -b_{m-1}$$\nSubstituting these into the sum of asymptotic poles:\n$$\\sum_{k=1}^{n-m} s'_k = -(-\\sum p_j - (-\\sum z_i)) = \\sum p_j - \\sum z_i$$\nThe asymptotes are straight lines that emanate from a common point on the real axis, the centroid $\\sigma_a$.
