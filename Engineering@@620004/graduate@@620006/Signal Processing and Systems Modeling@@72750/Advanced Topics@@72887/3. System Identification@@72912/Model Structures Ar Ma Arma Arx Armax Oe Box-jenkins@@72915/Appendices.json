Using first principles of Linear Time-Invariant (LTI) systems and the definition of Bounded-Input Bounded-Output (BIBO) stability, work from the root locations of the characteristic equation $A(z^{-1}) = 0$ to derive explicit algebraic inequalities on $(a_{1}, a_{2})$ that guarantee BIBO stability (i.e., all poles strictly inside the unit circle).\n\nThen, interpret these inequalities geometrically as a region in the $(a_{1}, a_{2})$-plane. Compute the exact area of this stability region.\n\nExpress the final area as an exact value with no units. No rounding is required. Your final answer must be a single real number.", "solution": "The problem asks for the derivation of stability conditions for a second-order autoregressive, AR(2), process. The discrete-time system is described by the linear difference equation:\n$$y_{t} + a_{1} y_{t-1} + a_{2} y_{t-2} = e_{t}$$\nwhere $y_{t}$ is the output, $e_{t}$ is a bounded input, and $a_{1}, a_{2}$ are real-valued coefficients. Using the backshift operator $q^{-1}$ where $q^{-k} y_{t} = y_{t-k}$, the equation is written as:\n$$(1 + a_{1} q^{-1} + a_{2} q^{-2}) y_{t} = e_{t}$$\nThis corresponds to a Linear Time-Invariant (LTI) system. The stability of such a system is determined by the locations of the poles of its transfer function. The Z-transform of the difference equation yields:\n$$(1 + a_{1} z^{-1} + a_{2} z^{-2}) Y(z) = E(z)$$\nThe transfer function $H(z) = \\frac{Y(z)}{E(z)}$ is therefore:\n$$H(z) = \\frac{1}{1 + a_{1} z^{-1} + a_{2} z^{-2}}$$\nThe poles of the system are the values of $z$ for which the denominator is zero. To find the poles, we solve the characteristic equation $1 + a_{1} z^{-1} + a_{2} z^{-2} = 0$. Multiplying by $z^2$ (for $z \\neq 0$) gives the characteristic polynomial in a more convenient form:\n$$P(z) = z^2 + a_{1} z + a_{2} = 0$$\nFor Bounded-Input Bounded-Output (BIBO) stability, all poles of the system, which are the roots of $P(z)$, must lie strictly inside the unit circle in the complex plane. That is, if $p_1$ and $p_2$ are the roots, we must have $|p_1| < 1$ and $|p_2| < 1$.\n\nWe derive the conditions on the real coefficients $(a_{1}, a_{2})$ by analyzing the roots of this quadratic equation. The nature of the roots depends on the discriminant, $\\Delta = a_{1}^2 - 4a_{2}$.\n\nCase 1: Real Roots ($\\Delta \\ge 0$)\nThe roots are real and given by $p_{1,2} = \\frac{-a_{1} \\pm \\sqrt{a_{1}^2 - 4a_{2}}}{2}$. For stability, both roots must lie in the interval $(-1, 1)$.\nThe quadratic $P(z)$ represents an upward-opening parabola. For its roots to be between $-1$ and $1$, the following conditions must be met:\n1. The function must be positive at the boundaries of the interval: $P(1) > 0$ and $P(-1) > 0$.\n   $$P(1) = 1 + a_{1} + a_{2} > 0 \\implies a_{2} > -a_{1} - 1$$\n   $$P(-1) = 1 - a_{1} + a_{2} > 0 \\implies a_{2} > a_{1} - 1$$\n2. The vertex of the parabola, located at $z = -a_1/2$, must lie between the roots. For the roots to be in $(-1,1)$, the vertex must also lie in this interval: $-1 < -a_{1}/2 < 1$, which implies $-2 < a_{1} < 2$.\n\nThese conditions are sufficient. Let's combine them with the real-root condition, $a_{1}^2 - 4a_{2} \\ge 0$, or $a_{2} \\le \\frac{a_{1}^2}{4}$. The stable region for real roots is thus characterized by:\n$$a_2 \\le \\frac{a_1^2}{4}$$\n$$a_2 > -a_1 - 1$$\n$$a_2 > a_1 - 1$$\nThe last two inequalities can be combined into $a_2 > |a_1| - 1$.\n\nCase 2: Complex Conjugate Roots ($\\Delta < 0$)\nThe roots are a complex conjugate pair, $p$ and $\\bar{p}$, given by $p = \\frac{-a_{1}}{2} + i \\frac{\\sqrt{4a_{2} - a_{1}^2}}{2}$.\nFor stability, we require $|p| < 1$. Since $|p|=|\\bar{p}|$, we only need to check one root. The squared modulus is:\n$$|p|^2 = \\left(\\frac{-a_{1}}{2}\\right)^2 + \\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{4a_{2} - a_{1}^2}}{2}\\right)^2 = \\frac{a_{1}^2}{4} + \\frac{4a_{2} - a_{1}^2}{4} = \\frac{4a_{2}}{4} = a_{2}$$\nThe stability condition $|p|^2 < 1$ directly translates to $a_{2} < 1$.\nThe condition for complex roots is $a_{1}^2 - 4a_{2} < 0$, or $a_{2} > \\frac{a_{1}^2}{4}$. Since $a_1$ is real, $a_1^2 \\ge 0$, which implies $a_2 > 0$.\nThus, for complex roots, the stability conditions are $a_{2} > \\frac{a_{1}^2}{4}$ and $a_2 < 1$.\nIt can be shown that these conditions imply $P(1) > 0$ and $P(-1) > 0$:\n$1 \\pm a_1 + a_2 > 1 \\pm a_1 + \\frac{a_1^2}{4} = (1 \\pm \\frac{a_1}{2})^2 \\ge 0$. As equality occurs only on the boundary parabola $a_2 = a_1^2/4$, the strict inequality holds inside the region.\n\nCombining the conditions for both cases provides the complete set of necessary and sufficient conditions for BIBO stability. These are known as the Jury stability criteria for a second-order system.\n1. From Case 1: $1 + a_{1} + a_{2} > 0 \\implies a_{2} > -a_{1} - 1$\n2. From Case 1: $1 - a_{1} + a_{2} > 0 \\implies a_{2} > a_{1} - 1$\n3. From Vieta's formulas, the product of the roots is $p_1 p_2 = a_2$. For stability, $|p_1|<1$ and $|p_2|<1$, which implies $|p_1 p_2| = |a_2| < 1$. This means $-1 < a_2 < 1$. This condition was crucial in Case 2 ($a_2<1$) and is also implied in Case 1, as $a_2 > |a_1|-1$ and $|a_1|<2$ gives $a_2 > -1$.\n\nThe full stability region in the $(a_{1}, a_{2})$-plane is defined by the intersection of these three inequalities:\n$$a_{2} > -a_{1} - 1$$\n$$a_{2} > a_{1} - 1$$\n$$a_{2} < 1$$\nThe inequality $a_{2} > -1$ is redundant, as it is implied by $a_2 > |a_1| - 1 \\ge -1$. The strict inequality holds because if $a_2 = -1$, then $|a_1|=0$, leading to $a_1=0$. The point $(a_1, a_2) = (0, -1)$ lies on the boundary of the region, not within it.\n\nGeometrically, these three linear inequalities define a triangular region in the $(a_{1}, a_{2})$-plane. To find the vertices of this triangle, we find the points where the boundary lines intersect.\n- Intersection of $a_{2} = -a_{1} - 1$ and $a_{2} = a_{1} - 1$:\n  $-a_{1} - 1 = a_{1} - 1 \\implies 2a_{1} = 0 \\implies a_{1} = 0$. This gives $a_{2} = -1$. Vertex is $(0, -1)$.\n- Intersection of $a_{2} = a_{1} - 1$ and $a_{2} = 1$:\n  $1 = a_{1} - 1 \\implies a_{1} = 2$. Vertex is $(2, 1)$.\n- Intersection of $a_{2} = -a_{1} - 1$ and $a_{2} = 1$:\n  $1 = -a_{1} - 1 \\implies a_{1} = -2$. Vertex is $(-2, 1)$.\n\nThe stability region is a triangle with vertices at $(0, -1)$, $(2, 1)$, and $(-2, 1)$.\n\nFinally, we compute the area of this triangle. We can consider the side connecting $(-2, 1)$ and $(2, 1)$ as the base. This base is a horizontal line segment of length:\n$$b = |2 - (-2)| = 4$$\nThe height of the triangle is the perpendicular distance from the third vertex $(0, -1)$ to the line containing the base, $a_{2} = 1$. The height is:\n$$h = |1 - (-1)| = 2$$\nThe area of the triangle is given by the formula $A = \\frac{1}{2} b h$.\n$$A = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 4 \\times 2 = 4$$\nThe area of the stability region is exactly $4$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{4}$$", "id": "2884705"}, {"introduction": "A key insight in system identification is that a given linear stochastic process can often be described by multiple, equivalent model structures.

The theoretical prediction error variance, $V_k$, is the variance of the first term.\n\nThe numerical stability of the inversion is related to how close the MA process is to being non-invertible, which occurs when a root of the characteristic polynomial $C(Z)$ is on the unit circle. This corresponds to the frequency response $C(e^{\\mathrm{i}\\omega})$ being zero at some frequency $\\omega$. The condition number $\\kappa$ of the associated convolution matrix is therefore approximated by the ratio of the maximum to minimum magnitude of the frequency response. A large $\\kappa$ implies ill-conditioning.\n\nThe implementation uses `numpy` for numerical arrays and operations, and `scipy.signal.lfilter` for efficient implementation of the FIR and IIR filtering steps.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy.signal import lfilter\n\ndef execute_case(c_coeffs, sigma_e_sq, k, T, seed):\n    \"\"\"\n    Executes a single test case for the innovation algorithm.\n\n    Args:\n        c_coeffs (list): List of Wold moving-average coefficients [c_0, c_1, ..., c_M].\n        sigma_e_sq (float): Variance of the innovations.\n        k (int): Prediction horizon.\n        T (int): Number of samples for MSE evaluation.\n        seed (int): Seed for the random number generator.\n\n    Returns:\n        list: A list containing [relative_error, log10_kappa].\n    \"\"\"\n    # === Step 1: Initialization ===\n    c = np.array(c_coeffs, dtype=np.float64)\n    sigma_e = np.sqrt(sigma_e_sq)\n    M = len(c) - 1\n    # Total simulation length to accommodate burn-in and k-step lookahead for the last evaluation point\n    simulation_length = M + T + k\n    rng = np.random.default_rng(seed)\n\n    # === Step 2: Data Simulation (y_t = C(z)e_t) ===\n    # Generate i.i.d.
