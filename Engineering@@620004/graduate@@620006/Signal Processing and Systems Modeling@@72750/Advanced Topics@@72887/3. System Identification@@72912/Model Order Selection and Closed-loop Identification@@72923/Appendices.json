The predictor is defined as the conditional expectation of the output $y(t)$ given all information available up to time $t-1$. This information set, denoted by $\\mathcal{I}_{t-1}$, consists of all past and present inputs up to time $t-1$ and all past outputs up to time $t-1$, i.e., $\\mathcal{I}_{t-1} = \\{u(t-1), u(t-2), \\dots, y(t-1), y(t-2), \\dots\\}$. For minimum-variance estimation, the predictor is given by:\n$$\n\\hat{y}(t \\mid t-1) = E[y(t) \\mid \\mathcal{I}_{t-1}]\n$$\nThe corresponding prediction error is defined as $\\varepsilon(t) = y(t) - \\hat{y}(t \\mid t-1)$. By the orthogonality principle, this error must be uncorrelated with any function of the data in $\\mathcal{I}_{t-1}$. In the given problem, the term $e(t)$ is defined as a zero-mean, i.i.d. white noise sequence, independent of past data. This makes $e(t)$ the innovation process, which is the fundamental unpredictable component of the process at time $t$. Therefore, our goal is to show that the prediction error is precisely this innovation term, i.e., $\\varepsilon(t) = e(t)$.\n\nWe start with the ARMAX model equation:\n$$\nA(q) y(t) = B(q) q^{-n_k} u(t) + C(q) e(t)\n$$\nwhere $\\theta$ represents the collection of all coefficients in the polynomials $A(q)$, $B(q)$, and $C(q)$. The core of the derivation is to rearrange this equation to express $y(t)$ as the sum of a term that is predictable from $\\mathcal{I}_{t-1}$ and another term that is unpredictable. The unpredictable term must be $e(t)$.\n\nWe can rearrange the ARMAX equation as follows to isolate $y(t)$:\n$$\ny(t) + \\sum_{i=1}^{n_a} a_i y(t-i) = \\sum_{i=1}^{n_b} b_i u(t-n_k-i) + e(t) + \\sum_{i=1}^{n_c} c_i e(t-i)\n$$\nThis can be written using the shift operator polynomials:\n$$\ny(t) = (1 - A(q)) y(t) + B(q) q^{-n_k} u(t) + (C(q) - 1) e(t) + e(t)\n$$\nNow, we apply the conditional expectation operator $E[\\cdot \\mid \\mathcal{I}_{t-1}]$ to this expression for $y(t)$:\n$$\n\\hat{y}(t \\mid t-1) = E \\left[ (1 - A(q)) y(t) + B(q) q^{-n_k} u(t) + (C(q) - 1) e(t) + e(t) \\mid \\mathcal{I}_{t-1} \\right]\n$$\nBy linearity of expectation, we can consider each term separately:\n$1$. The term $(1-A(q))y(t) = -a_1 y(t-1) - \\dots - a_{n_a} y(t-n_a)$ is a function of past outputs, which are contained in $\\mathcal{I}_{t-1}$.

The term $B(q)q^{-n_k}u(t) = b_1 u(t-n_k-1) + \\dots + b_{n_b} u(t-n_k-n_b)$ is a function of past inputs (assuming $n_k \\ge 1$ as is standard), which are in $\\mathcal{I}_{t-1}$. Thus, it is also known at time $t-1$.\n$3$. The term $(C(q) - 1)e(t) = c_1 e(t-1) + \\dots + c_{n_c} e(t-n_c)$ is a function of past innovations. The crucial assumption is that $C(q)$ is invertible (stable and minimum-phase). This allows us to express past innovations $e(\\tau)$ for $\\tau < t$ in terms of the measured data $\\{y(s), u(s)\\}_{s \\le \\tau}$ via the relation $e(\\tau) = C^{-1}(q) [A(q)y(\\tau) - B(q)q^{-n_k}u(\\tau)]$. Therefore, the sequence $\\{e(t-1), e(t-2), \\dots\\}$ is measurable with respect to the sigma-algebra generated by $\\mathcal{I}_{t-1}$ and is considered known.\n$4$. The term $e(t)$ is, by definition, the innovation at time $t$. It is a zero-mean process and independent of all past information. Therefore, $E[e(t) \\mid \\mathcal{I}_{t-1}] = E[e(t)] = 0$.\n\nCombining these results, we find the predictor:\n$$\n\\hat{y}(t \\mid t-1) = (1 - A(q)) y(t) + B(q) q^{-n_k} u(t) + (C(q) - 1) e(t)\n$$\nFrom this, the prediction error $\\varepsilon(t)$ is:\n$$\n\\varepsilon(t) = y(t) - \\hat{y}(t \\mid t-1) = y(t) - \\left[ (1 - A(q)) y(t) + B(q) q^{-n_k} u(t) + (C(q) - 1) e(t) \\right]\n$$\nSubstituting the ARMAX model relation $y(t) - (1-A(q))y(t) = A(q)y(t)$, we get:\n$$\n\\varepsilon(t) = A(q) y(t) - B(q) q^{-n_k} u(t) - (C(q) - 1) e(t)\n$$\nFrom the ARMAX definition, $A(q) y(t) - B(q) q^{-n_k} u(t) = C(q) e(t)$. Substituting this:\n$$\n\\varepsilon(t) = C(q) e(t) - (C(q) - 1) e(t) = C(q) e(t) - C(q) e(t) + e(t) = e(t)\n$$\nThis confirms that the one-step-ahead prediction error for the ARMAX model is exactly the innovation sequence $e(t)$, i.e., $\\varepsilon(t;\\theta) = e(t)$.\n\nTo obtain the final expression for the predictor $\\hat{y}(t \\mid t-1)$ in terms of the measured signals $\\{y(t), u(t)\\}$, we use the relation $\\hat{y}(t \\mid t-1) = y(t) - \\varepsilon(t) = y(t) - e(t)$. The innovation $e(t)$ must be expressed as a function of the measured data. From the ARMAX model, we have $C(q)e(t) = A(q)y(t) - B(q)q^{-n_k}u(t)$. Since $C(q)$ is invertible, we can write:\n$$\ne(t) = C^{-1}(q) \\left[ A(q) y(t) - B(q) q^{-n_k} u(t) \\right]\n$$\nSubstituting this into the expression for the predictor:\n$$\n\\hat{y}(t \\mid t-1) = y(t) - C^{-1}(q) \\left[ A(q) y(t) - B(q) q^{-n_k} u(t) \\right]\n$$\nFactoring terms with $y(t)$ and $u(t)$ yields the final form of the one-step-ahead predictor:\n$$\n\\hat{y}(t \\mid t-1) = \\left[ 1 - C^{-1}(q) A(q) \\right] y(t) + C^{-1}(q) B(q) q^{-n_k} u(t)\n$$\nThis result can also be written as $\\hat{y}(t \\mid t-1) = C^{-1}(q) \\left[ (C(q)-A(q))y(t) + B(q)q^{-n_k}u(t) \\right]$.\n\nFinally, regarding the closed-loop operation: the derivation of the algebraic form of the predictor shown above relies only on the assumed ARMAX model structure and the statistical properties of the innovation sequence $e(t)$. The existence of a feedback law, such as $u(t) = -K(q) y(t) + r(t)$, imposes a constraint between the $u(t)$ and $y(t)$ sequences but does not alter the mathematical definition of the system as described by the ARMAX equation. The predictor is constructed to be optimal for the given model structure, regardless of how the input signal $u(t)$ is generated. Therefore, the algebraic form of the optimal predictor, expressed as a causal operator on the measured data sequences $\\{u(t), y(t)\\}$, remains identical for both open-loop and closed-loop experiments. The challenges of closed-loop identification relate to ensuring the identifiability of the model parameters (which depends on the controller and external excitation), not to the form of the predictor itself.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\left[ 1 - C^{-1}(q) A(q) \\right] y(t) + C^{-1}(q) B(q) q^{-n_k} u(t)}\n$$", "id": "2883861"}, {"introduction": "Choosing an appropriate model order is as crucial as the parameter estimation itself, as it involves balancing model accuracy with complexity.

It is scientifically grounded in the principles of linear algebra and system identification, specifically low-rank approximation via Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) and the structure of Hankel matrices in subspace identification methods. The problem is well-posed, objective, and contains sufficient information to derive and implement a unique, deterministic algorithm. No contradictions, factual errors, or pseudo-scientific claims are present.\n\nThe task is to devise a principled heuristic for selecting the model order $r$ of a linear time-invariant system from a sequence of its estimated singular values, $\\mathbf{s} = (s_1, s_2, \\dots, s_n)$, where $s_1 \\ge s_2 \\ge \\dots \\ge s_n > 0$. The selection is aided by an external estimate of the noise floor, $\\tau > 0$. The chosen order, $r$, should correspond to the \"knee\" in the singular value plot, which separates the dominant singular values associated with system dynamics from the smaller singular values associated with noise.\n\nA valid model order $r$ implies that the system is best approximated by a rank-$r$ model. Per the Eckart-Young-Mirsky theorem, this retains the first $r$ singular values. Therefore, the division between signal and noise is expected to occur between $s_r$ and $s_{r+1}$. Our goal is to identify this index $r \\in \\{1, \\dots, n-1\\}$.\n\nFirst, a metric must be established to quantify the \"drop\" or \"gap\" between consecutive singular values. Let us consider the gap at index $i$, which is the drop from $s_i$ to $s_{i+1}$. A simple difference, $s_i - s_{i+1}$, is not suitable as it is not scale-invariant; scaling the entire data matrix by a factor $c$ would scale all singular values and their differences by $c$, changing the selected order. A scale-invariant metric is required, as the overall energy of the signals should not influence the deduced model order. The ratio $g_i = s_i / s_{i+1}$ is invariant to such scaling: $(c s_i) / (c s_{i+1}) = s_i / s_{i+1}$. A large ratio $g_i$ signifies a large relative drop, indicating a potential knee. The task thus reduces to finding the index $i$ that maximizes this criterion: $r = \\arg\\max_{i} g_i$.\n\nNext, we must incorporate the noise floor $\\tau$. The foundational assumption is that for a true system of order $r^\\star$, the singular values partition into a \"signal subspace\" and a \"noise subspace\" such that $s_1 \\ge \\dots \\ge s_{r^\\star} \\gg s_{r^\\star+1} \\approx \\dots \\approx s_n \\approx \\tau$. This implies that the most significant drop, the true knee, should ideally occur at an index $i$ where the singular values cross the noise floor. We formalize this by defining a \"straddling\" index $i$ as one for which $s_i > \\tau$ and $s_{i+1} \\le \\tau$.\n\nThe problem states a \"preference\" for such straddling knees. To implement this preference in a principled, non-arbitrary manner, we adopt a lexicographical or two-stage search strategy. This avoids introducing arbitrary weighting parameters.\n\nThe resulting stabilized gap heuristic is as follows:\n\n1.  **Initial Validation**: Check if any signal exists above the noise floor. If the largest singular value $s_1 \\le \\tau$, then all subsequent singular values are also at or below the noise floor. No system dynamics can be distinguished from noise. In this case, the model order must be $r = 0$.\n\n2.  **Primary Search (Straddling Gaps)**: If $s_1 > \\tau$, we proceed. We first identify the set of all straddling indices, $I_{straddle} = \\{ i \\in \\{1, \\dots, n-1\\} \\mid s_i > \\tau \\text{ and } s_{i+1} \\le \\tau \\}$. If this set is non-empty, it means there are one or more locations where the singular values cross the noise floor. Our search for the optimal order is then restricted exclusively to this set, as these are the most physically plausible locations for the knee. The selected order is the one corresponding to the largest gap ratio within this subset:\n    $$ r = \\arg\\max_{i \\in I_{straddle}} \\left(\\frac{s_i}{s_{i+1}}\\right) $$\n\n3.  **Fallback Search (All Gaps)**: If the set $I_{straddle}$ is empty while $s_1 > \\tau$, it implies that all singular values $\\{s_1, \\dots, s_n\\}$ are strictly greater than the noise floor $\\tau$. In this scenario, the noise floor estimate does not aid in partitioning the singular values. As per the problem specification, we must select an order from the \"above-floor region\". The procedure reverts to finding the largest relative drop across all possible indices:\n    $$ r = \\arg\\max_{i \\in \\{1, \\dots, n-1\\}} \\left(\\frac{s_i}{s_{i+1}}\\right) $$\n\n4.  **Tie-Breaking**: In either search stage, if the $\\arg\\max$ operation yields multiple indices with the same maximum gap ratio, a deterministic tie-breaking rule is required. In accordance with the principle of parsimony (Ockham's razor), we select the smallest index. This corresponds to choosing the simplest model (lowest order) that explains the data equally well.\n\nThis algorithm provides a complete, robust, and deterministic method for model order selection that adheres to all specified requirements. It is scale-invariant, privileges physically meaningful features when available, and handles all specified edge cases.", "answer": "```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef select_order(s_values, tau):\n    \"\"\"\n    Selects the system order using a stabilized gap heuristic.\n\n    Args:\n        s_values (list or np.ndarray): A list of strictly positive singular values\n                                      in descending order.\n        tau (float): A positive scalar representing the noise floor.\n\n    Returns:\n        int: The selected model order r.\n    \"\"\"\n    s = np.array(s_values, dtype=float)\n    n = len(s)\n\n    # Edge Case 1: All singular values are at or below the noise floor.\n    # If the largest singular value is not above tau, no signal is detectable.\n    if s[0] <= tau:\n        return 0\n\n    # There is at least one singular value above the noise floor.\n    # Possible orders are 1, ..., n-1.
