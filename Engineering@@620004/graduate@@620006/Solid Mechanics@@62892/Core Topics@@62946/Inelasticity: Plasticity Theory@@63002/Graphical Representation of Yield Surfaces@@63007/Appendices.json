This will be accomplished by first deriving the expressions for $J_2$ and $J_3$ from fundamental definitions and then calculating a defined residual $R$.\n\nThe stress state is characterized in Haigh-Westergaard coordinates by the mean stress $p$, the Mises equivalent stress $q$, and the Lode angle $\\theta$. The principal values of the Cauchy stress tensor $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}$ are $\\sigma_1$, $\\sigma_2$, and $\\sigma_3$, with the ordering $\\sigma_1 \\ge \\sigma_2 \\ge \\sigma_3$. The mean stress is $p = \\frac{1}{3}(\\sigma_1 + \\sigma_2 + \\sigma_3)$. The deviatoric stress tensor is $\\boldsymbol{s} = \\boldsymbol{\\sigma} - p\\boldsymbol{I}$, with principal values $s_i = \\sigma_i - p$ for $i=1, 2, 3$. The sum of the principal deviatoric stresses is zero: $s_1 + s_2 + s_3 = 0$. This equation defines the deviatoric plane, or $\\pi$-plane.\n\nThe second invariant of the deviatoric stress, $J_2$, is defined as $J_2 = \\frac{1}{2}(s_1^2 + s_2^2 + s_3^2)$. The Mises equivalent stress $q$ is defined by the relation $q = \\sqrt{3J_2}$. From this definition, we directly obtain the expression for $J_2$ in terms of $q$:\n$$q^2 = 3J_2 \\implies J_2 = \\frac{q^2}{3}$$\nThis expression is independent of $\\theta$, reflecting the fact that $J_2$ is a measure of the magnitude of the deviatoric stress.\n\nTo derive the expression for the third invariant, $J_3 = \\det(\\boldsymbol{s}) = s_1 s_2 s_3$, we must employ the geometric interpretation of the Lode angle. The angle $\\theta$ is the polar angle on the $\\pi$-plane, measured from the projection of the $s_1$ axis. The state of deviatoric stress is a vector $\\boldsymbol{s}=(s_1,s_2,s_3)$ on this plane. The reference direction for $\\theta$ is the projection of the first principal axis of stress, $\\boldsymbol{e}_1 = (1,0,0)$, onto the $\\pi$-plane. This projected vector is $\\boldsymbol{r}_1 = \\left(\\frac{2}{3}, -\\frac{1}{3}, -\\frac{1}{3}\\right)$, which has a magnitude of $|\\boldsymbol{r}_1| = \\sqrt{2/3}$. The magnitude of the deviatoric stress vector is $|\\boldsymbol{s}| = \\sqrt{s_1^2 + s_2^2 + s_3^2} = \\sqrt{2J_2}$.\n\nThe Lode angle $\\theta$ is the angle between $\\boldsymbol{s}$ and $\\boldsymbol{r}_1$. Thus, $\\cos(\\theta) = \\frac{\\boldsymbol{s}\\cdot\\boldsymbol{r}_1}{|\\boldsymbol{s}||\\boldsymbol{r}_1|}$. The dot product is $\\boldsymbol{s}\\cdot\\boldsymbol{r}_1 = \\frac{2}{3}s_1 - \\frac{1}{3}s_2 - \\frac{1}{3}s_3 = \\frac{1}{3}(2s_1 - (s_2+s_3))$. Since $s_2+s_3=-s_1$, the dot product simplifies to $\\boldsymbol{s}\\cdot\\boldsymbol{r}_1 = \\frac{1}{3}(2s_1 - (-s_1)) = s_1$.\nSubstituting this into the cosine formula yields:\n$$\\cos(\\theta) = \\frac{s_1}{\\sqrt{2J_2}\\sqrt{2/3}} = \\frac{s_1}{2\\sqrt{J_2/3}}$$\nFrom this, we express $s_1$ as $s_1 = 2\\sqrt{J_2/3}\\cos(\\theta)$. Due to the $120^\\circ$ ($2\\pi/3$ radians) cyclic symmetry of the principal axes on the $\\pi$-plane, we obtain expressions for $s_2$ and $s_3$ by shifting the angle:\n$$s_1 = 2\\sqrt{\\frac{J_2}{3}}\\cos(\\theta)$$\n$$s_2 = 2\\sqrt{\\frac{J_2}{3}}\\cos\\left(\\theta - \\frac{2\\pi}{3}\\right)$$\n$$s_3 = 2\\sqrt{\\frac{J_2}{3}}\\cos\\left(\\theta + \\frac{2\\pi}{3}\\right)$$\nWe now compute $J_3$ by taking the product $s_1s_2s_3$:\n$$J_3 = \\left(2\\sqrt{\\frac{J_2}{3}}\\right)^3 \\cos(\\theta)\\cos\\left(\\theta - \\frac{2\\pi}{3}\\right)\\cos\\left(\\theta + \\frac{2\\pi}{3}\\right)$$\nUsing the identity $\\cos(\\alpha)\\cos(\\alpha-\\beta)\\cos(\\alpha+\\beta) = \\frac{1}{4}\\cos(3\\alpha)$ is not correct. The correct identity is $\\cos A \\cos(60^\\circ-A)\\cos(60^\\circ+A) = \\frac{1}{4}\\cos(3A)$. Here, the shift is $120^\\circ$.

Viscoplastic regularization or yield-surface smoothing selects a unique flow direction by replacing the set-valued normal cone with the gradient of a smooth approximation; as the regularization parameter tends to zero, the selected flow direction tends to an element of the Tresca normal cone at the corner.\n\nSelect all that apply.", "solution": "The problem statement will first be validated for scientific soundness, clarity, and completeness.\n\n### Step 1: Extract Givens\n\n- **Solid type**: Homogeneous, isotropic, rate-independent, small-strain.\n- **Model**: Associated plasticity with Tresca yield criterion.\n- **Stress**: Cauchy stress $\\sigma$.\n- **Deviatoric stress**: $s = \\sigma - \\tfrac{1}{3}\\operatorname{tr}(\\sigma)\\,\\mathbf{I}$.\n- **Tresca yield function**: $f(\\sigma) = \\max_{i<j} \\left( \\lvert \\sigma_i - \\sigma_j \\rvert \\right) - 2k$, where $\\sigma_1, \\sigma_2, \\sigma_3$ are principal stresses and $k>0$ is the shear yield strength.\n- **Elastic domain**: $\\mathcal{K} = \\{\\sigma : f(\\sigma) \\le 0\\}$, which is a convex set.\n- **Yield surface geometry**: In the deviatoric $\\pi$-plane, the yield surface is a regular hexagon with flat facets and sharp corners.\n- **Flow rule at smooth points**: $d\\varepsilon^p$ is colinear with the outward normal to the yield surface.\n- **Normal cone definition**: At a boundary point $\\sigma^\\star$, the normal cone is $N_{\\mathcal{K}}(\\sigma^\\star) = \\{ \\eta \\,:\\, \\eta : (\\sigma - \\sigma^\\star) \\le 0 \\text{ for all } \\sigma \\in \\mathcal{K} \\}$.\n- **Associated flow rule (general form)**: At a boundary point $\\sigma^\\star$, the plastic strain rate $d\\varepsilon^p$ must satisfy $d\\varepsilon^p \\in \\lambda\\, N_{\\mathcal{K}}(\\sigma^\\star)$ for some scalar $\\lambda \\ge 0$.\n- **Problem context**: The stress state $\\sigma^\\star$ lies at a sharp corner of the Tresca hexagon in the deviatoric $\\pi$-plane.\n- **Task**: Evaluate the correctness of statements about the set of admissible flow directions and algorithmic selection rules at such a corner.\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\n\nThe problem statement is examined against the criteria for validity.\n\n1.  **Scientifically Grounded**: The problem is set firmly within the framework of classical, rate-independent plasticity theory, a cornerstone of solid mechanics. The concepts presented—Tresca yield criterion, associated flow rule, the use of convex analysis and normal cones for non-smooth yield surfaces, and computational aspects like return mapping and regularization—are all standard, well-established topics in advanced mechanics and computational engineering. The problem is scientifically sound.\n2.  **Well-Posed**: The problem asks for an evaluation of several statements based on the provided definitions and established theory. The definitions given for the Tresca criterion and the normal cone are standard and correct. The question is structured to test the understanding of these concepts. A definite answer for each statement can be derived from the provided framework.\n3.  **Objective**: The language is precise and technical. It uses standard terminology from continuum mechanics and convex analysis without ambiguity or subjective interpretation.\n4.  **Completeness**: All necessary definitions and context (associated plasticity, Tresca criterion, normal cone flow rule) are provided to analyze the statements. No external, unstated assumptions are required beyond \"well-known facts from convex analysis and plasticity,\" which is an acceptable context for a problem at this level.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\n\nThe problem statement is **valid**. It is scientifically sound, well-posed, and based on standard, non-controversial principles of continuum plasticity. The solution will proceed with the analysis of each option.\n\n### Analysis of the Options\n\nThe analysis is based on the theory of associated plasticity for non-smooth, convex yield surfaces. The Tresca yield surface is a convex set defined by the intersection of six linear inequalities in principal stress space, corresponding to its six facets. A corner is a point where two of these inequalities are met as equalities.\n\n**A. At a Tresca corner in the deviatoric $\\pi$-plane, the set of admissible associated plastic flow directions is exactly the convex cone generated by the outward unit normals to the two facets that meet at that corner.**\n\nThis statement is a direct application of the properties of normal cones for convex polyhedra. Let the elastic domain $\\mathcal{K}$ be defined locally near a corner $\\sigma^\\star$ by two active constraints (facets): $f_1(\\sigma) \\le 0$ and $f_2(\\sigma) \\le 0$, where $f_1(\\sigma^\\star) = f_2(\\sigma^\\star) = 0$. The functions $f_1$ and $f_2$ are linear in stress components for the Tresca criterion. The outward normals to these facets are given by their gradients, $\\nabla f_1$ and $\\nabla f_2$. From convex analysis, the normal cone $N_{\\mathcal{K}}(\\sigma^\\star)$ at the intersection of these two half-spaces is the set of all non-negative linear combinations of the individual gradients:\n$$ N_{\\mathcal{K}}(\\sigma^\\star) = \\{ c_1 \\nabla f_1(\\sigma^\\star) + c_2 \\nabla f_2(\\sigma^\\star) \\mid c_1 \\ge 0, c_2 \\ge 0 \\} $$\nThis is precisely the definition of the convex cone spanned by the vectors $\\nabla f_1$ and $\\nabla f_2$. These vectors are constant for each facet and represent the outward normals. Normalizing them to unit vectors does not change the generated cone, as the non-negative scalars $c_1$ and $c_2$ can account for any magnitude. The associated flow rule states $d\\varepsilon^p \\in \\lambda N_{\\mathcal{K}}(\\sigma^\\star)$, so the set of admissible flow directions (for $\\lambda>0$) is indeed this normal cone.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. At a Tresca corner, the associated flow direction is unique and must coincide with the angular bisector of the two adjacent facets in the deviatoric $\\pi$-plane.**\n\nThis statement claims uniqueness. As established in the analysis of option A, the set of admissible flow directions is a cone, which contains an infinite number of vectors. The direction is therefore fundamentally non-unique from the perspective of the flow rule itself. The angular bisector corresponds to the specific case where the coefficients in the conic combination are equal (i.e., $c_1=c_2$ if the normals $\\nabla f_1$ and $\\nabla f_2$ have the same magnitude, which they do for the regular Tresca hexagon). While this is one possible direction within the cone, there is no principle in the problem statement that forces this specific choice. The theory allows for *any* direction in the cone. Therefore, the claim of uniqueness is false.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. In active-set return-mapping implementations of multi-surface plasticity that enforce the Karush–Kuhn–Tucker (KKT) conditions and consistency, the algorithm identifies a set of active facets and computes plastic multipliers for them; when two adjacent facets remain active at a corner, the resulting plastic strain-rate is any conic combination of their facet normals, i.e., an element of the normal cone, so the corner non-uniqueness is represented but does not compromise the uniqueness of the updated stress.**\n\nThis statement describes the behavior of standard computational plasticity algorithms. A return-mapping algorithm finds the updated stress $\\sigma_{n+1}$ by projecting a trial stress $\\sigma^\\text{trial}$ onto the elastic domain $\\mathcal{K}$. Since $\\mathcal{K}$ is a closed convex set, this projection is unique. That is, for any $\\sigma^\\text{trial}$ outside $\\mathcal{K}$, there exists a unique point $\\sigma_{n+1} \\in \\mathcal{K}$ that is closest to it. The KKT conditions for this constrained minimization problem require that the vector pointing from $\\sigma_{n+1}$ to $\\sigma^\\text{trial}$ (the \"return direction\") must lie in the normal cone at $\\sigma_{n+1}$. The plastic strain increment $\\Delta\\varepsilon^p$ is proportional to this return direction.\nIf the projection point $\\sigma_{n+1}$ is at a corner, then $\\Delta\\varepsilon^p$ will be an element of the normal cone at that corner. The algorithm determines the unique coefficients of the conic combination (the plastic multipliers) that satisfy the projection, thus resolving the apparent non-uniqueness of the flow rule for a specific time step. The statement correctly asserts that even though the flow direction is chosen from a cone (representing the \"corner non-uniqueness\"), the final stress update is unique due to the properties of projection onto a convex set. The phrasing \"is any conic combination\" is slightly imprecise but is qualified by \"i.e., an element of the normal cone,\" and the main thrust of the statement is that the algorithm handles the non-uniqueness of the flow rule to produce a unique stress state. This is a correct description of the outcome.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**D. A commonly used numerical tie-breaker at corners is to select the normal that minimizes the plastic dissipation rate $\\sigma : d\\varepsilon^p$ among all admissible normals, which enhances stability.**\n\nThe plastic dissipation rate is defined as $\\mathcal{D} = \\sigma : d\\varepsilon^p$. A fundamental postulate of stable plasticity (Drucker's stability postulate) implies the principle of maximum plastic dissipation. This principle states that for a given plastic strain rate, the actual stress is the one on the yield surface that maximizes $\\mathcal{D}$. Conversely, the constitutive law (associated flow rule) is such that it maximizes dissipation. Choosing a flow direction $d\\varepsilon^p$ from the normal cone that *minimizes* the dissipation $\\sigma^\\star : d\\varepsilon^p$ (for the fixed stress $\\sigma^\\star$ at the corner) would be in direct contradiction to this fundamental principle. Such a choice would not be physically or thermodynamically sound and would likely lead to numerical or physical instabilities, not enhance them.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**E. Viscoplastic regularization or yield-surface smoothing selects a unique flow direction by replacing the set-valued normal cone with the gradient of a smooth approximation; as the regularization parameter tends to zero, the selected flow direction tends to an element of the Tresca normal cone at the corner.**\n\nThis describes a common and powerful technique for dealing with non-smooth yield surfaces. The sharp corners of the Tresca hexagon are \"rounded\" by a smooth function, controlled by a small regularization parameter $\\epsilon$. For any $\\epsilon > 0$, the yield surface is smooth ($C^1$ or smoother), and therefore has a unique outward normal vector (the gradient) at every point. The associated flow rule then provides a unique plastic flow direction. A key result from convex analysis (concerning the convergence of gradients of smooth approximations to the subdifferential of the limit function) confirms that as $\\epsilon \\to 0$, the sequence of unique normals from the regularized surface at points converging to a corner of the original surface will converge to a vector. This limit vector is guaranteed to be an element of the normal cone of the original, non-smooth surface at that corner. The specific element it converges to depends on how the corner is approached. Thus, this method provides a physically and mathematically consistent way to select a unique flow direction that is still compliant with the original non-smooth theory in the limit.\n**Verdict: Correct.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{ACE}$$", "id": "2645194"}]}
