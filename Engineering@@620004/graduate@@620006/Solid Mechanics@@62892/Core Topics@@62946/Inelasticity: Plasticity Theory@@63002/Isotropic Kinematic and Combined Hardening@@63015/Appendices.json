We may proceed to the solution.\n\nThe problem requires the evaluation of the yield condition at a trial stress state within the framework of $J_2$ plasticity with combined isotropic and kinematic hardening. The yield function, denoted by $f$, defines the boundary of the elastic domain in stress space. For combined hardening, this function is expressed in terms of the Cauchy stress tensor $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}$, the backstress tensor $\\boldsymbol{\\alpha}$, and a scalar variable representing the size of the yield surface, $\\sigma_y$, which is a function of an internal hardening variable, for example, the equivalent plastic strain $\\kappa$.\n\nThe general form of the von Mises yield criterion with combined hardening is:\n$$f(\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}, \\boldsymbol{\\alpha}, \\kappa) = \\sigma_{eq}(\\boldsymbol{\\sigma} - \\boldsymbol{\\alpha}) - \\sigma_y(\\kappa) \\le 0$$\nwhere $\\sigma_{eq}$ denotes the von Mises equivalent stress.
