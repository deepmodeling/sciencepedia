After first reaching yield, the following stress path in principal components is imposed while enforcing consistency (i.e., the state remains on the active yield surface as plastic flow occurs).\n\nDefine a two-segment stress path in principal stress space:\n- Segment A ($0\\le \\lambda<1$): \n$$\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}(\\lambda)=\\mathrm{diag}\\big(k,\\,-k,\\,-k+\\delta(1-\\lambda)\\big),$$\nwith a fixed small parameter $0<\\delta<k$.\n- Segment B ($1<\\lambda\\le 1+\\epsilon$): \n$$\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}(\\lambda)=\\mathrm{diag}\\big(k,\\,-k+\\beta(\\lambda-1),\\,-k\\big),$$\nwith $0<\\beta\\ll k$ and some small $\\epsilon>0$.\n\nThis path approaches the point $\\mathrm{diag}(k,\\,-k,\\,-k)$ from Segment A, then leaves it along Segment B.

This implies the plastic strain rate vector lies in the convex cone formed by the normals to the active yield surfaces.\n\n**Evaluation of Statement A**\n\n*   **Crossing an edge:** At $\\lambda=1$, the stress state is $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma} = \\mathrm{diag}(k, -k, -k)$. This point satisfies both $f_A = \\sigma_1 - \\sigma_2 - 2k = 0$ and $f_B = \\sigma_1 - \\sigma_3 - 2k = 0$. This is the definition of an edge on the Tresca yield cylinder. The projection of this edge onto the deviatoric plane is a vertex of the Tresca hexagon. The statement is correct.\n*   **Plastic flow on Segment A ($\\lambda<1$):** The active yield function is $f_A = \\sigma_1 - \\sigma_2 - 2k = 0$. The direction of the normal is given by the gradient $\\frac{\\partial f_A}{\\partial \\boldsymbol{\\sigma}}$, whose principal components are $[\\frac{\\partial f_A}{\\partial \\sigma_1}, \\frac{\\partial f_A}{\\partial \\sigma_2}, \\frac{\\partial f_A}{\\partial \\sigma_3}] = [1, -1, 0]$. Thus, for $\\lambda<1$, $\\dot{\\boldsymbol{\\epsilon}}^p$ is proportional to $[\\,1, -1, 0\\,]$. This matches the statement.\n*   **Plastic flow on Segment B ($\\lambda>1$):** The active yield function is $f_B = \\sigma_1 - \\sigma_3 - 2k = 0$. The direction of the normal is given by $\\frac{\\partial f_B}{\\partial \\boldsymbol{\\sigma}}$, whose principal components are $[1, 0, -1]$. Thus, for $\\lambda>1$, $\\dot{\\boldsymbol{\\epsilon}}^p$ is proportional to $[\\,1, 0, -1\\,]$. This also matches the statement.\n*   **Behavior at the edge ($\\lambda=1$):** As the path transitions from Segment A to Segment B, the plastic flow direction must change from being proportional to $[\\,1, -1, 0\\,]$ to being proportional to $[\\,1, 0, -1\\,]$. This is a finite jump in direction. At the vertex itself, Koiter's rule applies, and any plastic strain rate vector of the form $\\dot{\\boldsymbol{\\epsilon}}^p = \\dot{\\gamma}_A[\\,1, -1, 0\\,] + \\dot{\\gamma}_B[\\,1, 0, -1\\,]$ (for $\\dot{\\gamma}_A, \\dot{\\gamma}_B \\ge 0$) is admissible. The choice of $\\dot{\\gamma}_A$ and $\\dot{\\gamma}_B$ would be determined by the consistency conditions for the prescribed stress rate. The statement correctly describes this behavior.\n\nStatement A is **Correct**.\n\n**Evaluation of Statement B**\n\nThis statement claims the plastic multiplier must become $0$ at the edge, implying a momentary elastic response. The problem explicitly states that \"the state remains on the active yield surface as plastic flow occurs.\" This implies continuous plastic deformation. If the plastic multiplier $\\dot{\\gamma}$ (or both $\\dot{\\gamma}_A$ and $\\dot{\\gamma}_B$) were zero, there would be no plastic flow, $\\dot{\\boldsymbol{\\epsilon}}^p = \\boldsymbol{0}$. The material response would be purely elastic. However, the stress path is prescribed to move along the yield surface, which necessitates plastic flow to satisfy the consistency condition for a perfectly plastic material. There is no physical or mathematical reason for plastic flow to cease at an edge crossing during a continuous plastic loading process. Therefore, the assertion that the plastic multiplier must be zero is incorrect.\n\nStatement B is **Incorrect**.\n\n**Evaluation of Statement C**\n\nThis statement discusses the von Mises yield criterion, which is given by $f(\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}) = J_2(\\boldsymbol{s}) - k^2 = 0$, where $J_2$ is the second invariant of the deviatoric stress tensor $\\boldsymbol{s}$. In principal stress space, this equation defines a smooth, circular cylinder. A circular cylinder has no edges or corners. The normal vector to the von Mises surface is unique at every point. The normal is proportional to the deviatoric stress tensor, $\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial \\boldsymbol{\\sigma}} \\propto \\boldsymbol{s}$. Consequently, for an associated flow rule, the plastic flow direction is always unique and aligned with $\\boldsymbol{s}$. The premise that \"the von Mises surface has corners\" is fundamentally false. Therefore, an analogous vertex crossing with a non-unique flow direction cannot occur.\n\nStatement C is **Incorrect**.\n\n**Evaluation of Statement D**\n\nThis statement claims that plastic incompressibility is preserved for the Tresca model throughout the path. Plastic incompressibility means the plastic volumetric strain rate, $\\dot{\\epsilon}_v^p = \\mathrm{tr}(\\dot{\\boldsymbol{\\epsilon}}^p)$, is zero.\nThe problem states that the yield criterion is \"pressure-insensitive\", meaning the yield function $f$ does not depend on the hydrostatic stress $p = \\frac{1}{3}\\mathrm{tr}(\\boldsymbol{\\sigma})$. A property of any such function $f(\\sigma_1, \\sigma_2, \\sigma_3)$ is that $\\sum_i \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial \\sigma_i} = 0$.\nThe associated flow rule gives $\\dot{\\boldsymbol{\\epsilon}}^p = \\dot{\\gamma} \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial \\boldsymbol{\\sigma}}$. The plastic volumetric strain rate is then:\n$$ \\dot{\\epsilon}_v^p = \\mathrm{tr}(\\dot{\\boldsymbol{\\epsilon}}^p) = \\mathrm{tr}\\left(\\dot{\\gamma} \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial \\boldsymbol{\\sigma}}\\right) = \\dot{\\gamma} \\, \\mathrm{tr}\\left(\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial \\boldsymbol{\\sigma}}\\right) = \\dot{\\gamma} \\left(\\sum_{i=1}^3 \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial \\sigma_i}\\right) = \\dot{\\gamma} \\cdot 0 = 0 $$\nThis holds wherever the flow rule applies. Specifically:\n- On Segment A, the flow direction is proportional to $[\\,1, -1, 0\\,]$. The sum of components is $1-1+0=0$.\n- On Segment B, the flow direction is proportional to $[\\,1, 0, -1\\,]$. The sum of components is $1+0-1=0$.\n- At the edge $(\\lambda=1)$, the flow vector is a non-negative linear combination of the normals: $\\dot{\\boldsymbol{\\epsilon}}^p \\propto \\dot{\\gamma}_A[\\,1, -1, 0\\,] + \\dot{\\gamma}_B[\\,1, 0, -1\\,] = [\\dot{\\gamma}_A+\\dot{\\gamma}_B, -\\dot{\\gamma}_A, -\\dot{\\gamma}_B]$. The sum of the components is $(\\dot{\\gamma}_A+\\dot{\\gamma}_B) - \\dot{\\gamma}_A - \\dot{\\gamma}_B = 0$.\nIn all cases, the plastic volumetric strain rate is zero. Plastic incompressibility is a direct consequence of using an associated flow rule with a pressure-insensitive yield criterion, which is true for Tresca's criterion. This property is maintained throughout the entire plastic loading path, including the edge crossing.\n\nStatement D is **Correct**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{AD}$$", "id": "2706978"}]}
