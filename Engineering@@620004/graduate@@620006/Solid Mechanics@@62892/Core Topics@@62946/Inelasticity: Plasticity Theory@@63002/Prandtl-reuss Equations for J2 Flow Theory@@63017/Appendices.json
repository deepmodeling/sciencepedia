It describes a standard model in continuum plasticity, provides all necessary equations, material parameters, initial conditions, and loading histories. The validation criteria are objective and numerically verifiable. Therefore, the problem is valid, and a solution will be derived from the fundamental principles provided.\n\nThe core of the solution is an incremental update procedure based on a backward Euler integration scheme, commonly known as a return-mapping algorithm. This algorithm consists of an elastic predictor step followed by a plastic corrector step if the yield condition is violated. We will derive this algorithm for the specified one-dimensional case.\n\nLet the state at the beginning of a time increment (step $n$) be known: $(\\sigma_{n}, \\varepsilon^{p}_{n}, \\alpha_{n})$. We are given the total strain at the end of the increment, $\\varepsilon_{n+1}$. Our goal is to compute the state $(\\sigma_{n+1}, \\varepsilon^{p}_{n+1}, \\alpha_{n+1})$.\n\nThe fundamental relations, discretized over the increment from $n$ to $n+1$, are:\n1.  Additive strain decomposition: $\\varepsilon_{n+1} = \\varepsilon^{e}_{n+1} + \\varepsilon^{p}_{n+1}$\n2.  Linear elastic stress-strain relation: $\\sigma_{n+1} = E \\cdot \\varepsilon^{e}_{n+1} = E (\\varepsilon_{n+1} - \\varepsilon^{p}_{n+1})$\n3.  Discrete flow rule: $\\varepsilon^{p}_{n+1} = \\varepsilon^{p}_{n} + \\Delta\\varepsilon^{p} = \\varepsilon^{p}_{n} + \\Delta\\lambda \\cdot \\text{sign}(\\sigma_{n+1})$\n4.  Discrete hardening law: $\\alpha_{n+1} = \\alpha_{n} + \\Delta\\alpha = \\alpha_{n} + \\Delta\\lambda$\n5.  Yield condition: $f_{n+1} = |\\sigma_{n+1}| - (\\sigma_{y0} + H \\alpha_{n+1}) \\le 0$\n6.  Kuhn-Tucker loading/unloading conditions: $\\Delta\\lambda \\ge 0$, $f_{n+1} \\le 0$, $\\Delta\\lambda \\cdot f_{n+1} = 0$\n\nHere, $\\Delta\\lambda$ is the increment in the plastic multiplier, which quantifies the amount of plastic flow within the step. The term $\\text{sign}(\\sigma_{n+1})$ arises from the evaluation of $\\partial f/\\partial \\sigma = \\partial |\\sigma|/\\partial \\sigma$ for the uniaxial case.\n\nThe algorithm proceeds in two main stages for each increment.\n\n**Step 1: Elastic Predictor**\nFirst, we assume the entire strain increment is purely elastic. This is equivalent to setting the plastic multiplier increment to zero, $\\Delta\\lambda = 0$. The resulting \"trial\" state is calculated:\n- Trial plastic strain: $\\varepsilon^{p, \\text{tr}}_{n+1} = \\varepsilon^{p}_{n}$\n- Trial hardening variable: $\\alpha^{\\text{tr}}_{n+1} = \\alpha_{n}$\n- Trial stress: $\\sigma^{\\text{tr}}_{n+1} = E (\\varepsilon_{n+1} - \\varepsilon^{p, \\text{tr}}_{n+1}) = E (\\varepsilon_{n+1} - \\varepsilon^{p}_{n})$\n\n**Step 2: Yield Check and Plastic Corrector**\nNext, we check if this trial stress violates the yield condition defined by the state at the beginning of the increment. We evaluate the yield function at the trial state:\n$$f^{\\text{tr}} = |\\sigma^{\\text{tr}}_{n+1}| - \\sigma_{y}(\\alpha_{n}) = |\\sigma^{\\text{tr}}_{n+1}| - (\\sigma_{y0} + H \\alpha_{n})$$\n\nThere are two possible outcomes:\n\n**Case I: Elastic Step ($f^{\\text{tr}} \\le 0$)**\nIf the trial yield function is not positive, the trial stress is within or on the yield surface. The assumption of an elastic step was correct. The state at the end of the increment is the trial state:\n- $\\sigma_{n+1} = \\sigma^{\\text{tr}}_{n+1}$\n- $\\varepsilon^{p}_{n+1} = \\varepsilon^{p}_{n}$\n- $\\alpha_{n+1} = \\alpha_{n}$\nIn this case, $\\Delta\\lambda = 0$, satisfying the Kuhn-Tucker conditions.\n\n**Case II: Plastic Step ($f^{\\text{tr}} > 0$)**\nIf the trial yield function is positive, the trial stress lies outside the yield surface, which is physically inadmissible. Plastic deformation must occur to return the stress state to the yield surface. The state must be updated such that the consistency condition, $f_{n+1} = 0$, is satisfied. This is the plastic corrector or \"return mapping\" step.\n\nWe must find the non-negative value of $\\Delta\\lambda$ that satisfies the governing equations. Substitute the flow rule (3) into the elastic law (2):\n$$\\sigma_{n+1} = E (\\varepsilon_{n+1} - (\\varepsilon^{p}_{n} + \\Delta\\lambda \\cdot \\text{sign}(\\sigma_{n+1})))$$\nRecognizing that $\\sigma^{\\text{tr}}_{n+1} = E(\\varepsilon_{n+1} - \\varepsilon^{p}_{n})$ and that the direction of stress does not change sign during correction for this simple model, so $\\text{sign}(\\sigma_{n+1}) = \\text{sign}(\\sigma^{\\text{tr}}_{n+1})$, we have:\n$$\\sigma_{n+1} = \\sigma^{\\text{tr}}_{n+1} - E \\cdot \\Delta\\lambda \\cdot \\text{sign}(\\sigma^{\\text{tr}}_{n+1})$$\nTaking the absolute value of both sides gives:\n$$|\\sigma_{n+1}| = |\\sigma^{\\text{tr}}_{n+1}| - E \\cdot \\Delta\\lambda$$\n\nThe final stress must lie on the updated yield surface, so from the yield condition (5) and hardening law (4):\n$$|\\sigma_{n+1}| = \\sigma_{y0} + H \\alpha_{n+1} = \\sigma_{y0} + H (\\alpha_{n} + \\Delta\\lambda)$$\n\nEquating the two expressions for $|\\sigma_{n+1}|$:\n$$|\\sigma^{\\text{tr}}_{n+1}| - E \\cdot \\Delta\\lambda = \\sigma_{y0} + H \\alpha_{n} + H \\cdot \\Delta\\lambda$$\nWe can now solve for the unknown consistency parameter $\\Delta\\lambda$:\n$$|\\sigma^{\\text{tr}}_{n+1}| - (\\sigma_{y0} + H \\alpha_{n}) = (E + H) \\Delta\\lambda$$\nThe left side is precisely the trial yield function, $f^{\\text{tr}}$. Therefore:\n$$\\Delta\\lambda = \\frac{f^{\\text{tr}}}{E + H} = \\frac{|\\sigma^{\\text{tr}}_{n+1}| - (\\sigma_{y0} + H \\alpha_{n})}{E + H}$$\nSince we are in the plastic case ($f^{\\text{tr}} > 0$) and both $E$ and $H$ are non-negative material constants ($E>0$), it follows that $\\Delta\\lambda > 0$, consistent with the Kuhn-Tucker conditions.\n\nWith $\\Delta\\lambda$ determined, the state variables are updated:\n1.  Hardening variable: $\\alpha_{n+1} = \\alpha_{n} + \\Delta\\lambda$\n2.  Plastic strain: $\\varepsilon^{p}_{n+1} = \\varepsilon^{p}_{n} + \\Delta\\lambda \\cdot \\text{sign}(\\sigma^{\\text{tr}}_{n+1})$\n3.  Stress: $\\sigma_{n+1} = E (\\varepsilon_{n+1} - \\varepsilon^{p}_{n+1})$\n\nThis concludes the derivation of the update algorithm. The algorithm is robust and will be implemented to perform the required numerical experiments.

The setup is self-contained and free of contradictions. The problem is well-posed, as the behavior of the specified model under these conditions is uniquely determined. It is expressed in objective, precise language common to the field. The problem is not trivial; it tests a fundamental understanding of the distinction between rate-independent and rate-dependent material behavior.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\n\nThe problem statement is **valid**. A solution will be derived.\n\n### Derivation\n\nThe analysis is based on the standard framework of rate-independent elastoplasticity. The core equations, specialized for a uniaxial stress state, are as follows:\n\n1.  **Additive Strain Decomposition**: The total axial strain rate $\\dot{\\varepsilon}$ is the sum of the elastic strain rate $\\dot{\\varepsilon}^e$ and the plastic strain rate $\\dot{\\varepsilon}^p$.\n    $$ \\dot{\\varepsilon} = \\dot{\\varepsilon}^e + \\dot{\\varepsilon}^p $$\n2.  **Elastic Law (Hooke's Law)**: The axial stress rate $\\dot{\\sigma}$ is related to the elastic strain rate.\n    $$ \\dot{\\sigma} = E \\dot{\\varepsilon}^e $$\n    Combining these two gives the fundamental rate equation:\n    $$ \\dot{\\varepsilon} = \\frac{\\dot{\\sigma}}{E} + \\dot{\\varepsilon}^p \\quad \\implies \\quad \\dot{\\sigma} = E(\\dot{\\varepsilon} - \\dot{\\varepsilon}^p) $$\n3.  **Yield Function and Flow Rule**: The yield criterion for $J_2$ plasticity in uniaxial tension ($\\sigma  0$) is given by $\\Phi \\le 0$. The associative flow rule links the plastic strain rate to the yield function.\n    -   For isotropic hardening: $\\Phi = \\sigma - \\sigma_y(\\alpha) \\le 0$, where $\\sigma_y(\\alpha) = \\sigma_{Y0} + H\\alpha$ is the current yield stress, $\\sigma_{Y0}$ is the initial yield stress, and $\\alpha$ is the equivalent plastic strain. The flow rule gives $\\dot{\\varepsilon}^p = \\dot{\\gamma} \\frac{\\partial \\Phi}{\\partial \\sigma} = \\dot{\\gamma}$, where $\\dot{\\gamma}$ is the plastic multiplier rate. The hardening law is $\\dot{\\alpha} = \\dot{\\varepsilon}^p$.\n    -   For kinematic hardening: $\\Phi = |\\sigma - \\xi| - \\sigma_{Y0} \\le 0$, where $\\xi$ is the backstress. For uniaxial tension, this simplifies to $\\Phi = \\sigma - \\xi - \\sigma_{Y0} \\le 0$. The flow rule gives $\\dot{\\varepsilon}^p = \\dot{\\gamma}$. The linear kinematic hardening law (Prager's rule specialized to 1D) is $\\dot{\\xi} = H_k \\dot{\\varepsilon}^p$.\n\n4.  **Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) Conditions**: These govern plastic flow.\n    -   $\\Phi \\le 0$ (Admissible stress state)\n    -   $\\dot{\\gamma} \\ge 0$ (Non-negative plastic flow)\n    -   $\\dot{\\gamma} \\Phi = 0$ (Complementarity or loading/unloading condition)\n\n5.  **Consistency Condition**: During plastic loading ($\\dot{\\gamma}  0$), the stress state must remain on the yield surface, which requires the rate of change of the yield function to be zero: $\\dot{\\Phi} = 0$.\n\n### Analysis of the Strain-Hold Phase\n\nDuring the hold phase, for $t \\ge t_0$, the total strain is held constant: $\\varepsilon(t) = \\text{constant}$. This implies the total strain rate is zero:\n$$ \\dot{\\varepsilon} = 0 $$\nSubstituting this into the fundamental rate equation gives a direct relationship between the stress rate and the plastic strain rate:\n$$ \\dot{\\sigma} = -E \\dot{\\varepsilon}^p $$\nStress relaxation implies a decrease in stress over time, i.e., $\\dot{\\sigma}  0$. This would require a non-zero plastic strain rate, $\\dot{\\varepsilon}^p  0$. We must now investigate if such a condition is possible.\n\nFor plastic flow to occur ($\\dot{\\varepsilon}^p  0$), the plastic multiplier rate must be positive, $\\dot{\\gamma}  0$. According to the KKT conditions, this requires the stress state to be on the yield surface ($\\Phi = 0$) and to remain there, which invokes the consistency condition $\\dot{\\Phi}=0$.\n\n**Case 1: Linear Isotropic Hardening ($H \\ge 0$)**\nThe yield function is $\\Phi = \\sigma - (\\sigma_{Y0} + H\\alpha) = 0$.\nThe consistency condition is $\\dot{\\Phi} = \\dot{\\sigma} - H\\dot{\\alpha} = 0$.\nWith the hardening law $\\dot{\\alpha} = \\dot{\\varepsilon}^p$, this becomes:\n$$ \\dot{\\sigma} = H \\dot{\\varepsilon}^p $$\nWe now have two simultaneous requirements for the stress rate if plastic flow were to continue during the strain hold:\n1.  From the strain hold condition: $\\dot{\\sigma} = -E \\dot{\\varepsilon}^p$\n2.  From the consistency condition: $\\dot{\\sigma} = H \\dot{\\varepsilon}^p$\n\nEquating these gives:\n$$ -E \\dot{\\varepsilon}^p = H \\dot{\\varepsilon}^p \\quad \\implies \\quad (E+H)\\dot{\\varepsilon}^p = 0 $$\nGiven that $E  0$ and $H \\ge 0$, the sum $(E+H)$ is strictly positive. Therefore, the only possible solution is:\n$$ \\dot{\\varepsilon}^p = 0 $$\nThis implies that the plastic flow must cease. Consequently, the stress rate becomes:\n$$ \\dot{\\sigma} = -E \\dot{\\varepsilon}^p = 0 $$\nThe stress remains constant. No stress relaxation occurs.\n\n**Case 2: Linear Kinematic Hardening ($H_k \\ge 0$)**\nThe yield function is $\\Phi = \\sigma - \\xi - \\sigma_{Y0} = 0$.\nThe consistency condition is $\\dot{\\Phi} = \\dot{\\sigma} - \\dot{\\xi} = 0$.\nWith the hardening law $\\dot{\\xi} = H_k \\dot{\\varepsilon}^p$, this becomes:\n$$ \\dot{\\sigma} = H_k \\dot{\\varepsilon}^p $$\nThis leads to the exact same contradiction as in the isotropic case. We require both $\\dot{\\sigma} = -E \\dot{\\varepsilon}^p$ and $\\dot{\\sigma} = H_k \\dot{\\varepsilon}^p$.\n$$ -E \\dot{\\varepsilon}^p = H_k \\dot{\\varepsilon}^p \\quad \\implies \\quad (E+H_k)\\dot{\\varepsilon}^p = 0 $$\nSince $E  0$ and $H_k \\ge 0$, the sum $(E+H_k)$ is strictly positive. Again, the only solution is:\n$$ \\dot{\\varepsilon}^p = 0 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\dot{\\sigma} = 0 $$\nThe stress remains constant. No stress relaxation occurs, regardless of the hardening type.\n\nThe fundamental reason for this result is the **rate-independent** nature of the model. In such a model, the evolution of internal variables (like plastic strain) is driven by increments in the external load (total strain), not by the passage of time itself. When the external driver is held constant ($\\dot{\\varepsilon} = 0$), all internal evolution must cease. Stress relaxation is an inherently time-dependent phenomenon, which requires a mechanism, such as viscosity, that introduces an intrinsic time scale.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. Under the stated rate-independent Prandtl–Reuss J2 model (no viscosity), after the strain is held constant, the stress is constant in time; no stress relaxation occurs.**\nThis statement is a direct consequence of the derivations above. For both isotropic and kinematic hardening, it was proven that $\\dot{\\sigma} = 0$ during the strain hold. This statement is **Correct**.\n\n**B. The stress decays exponentially with a characteristic time that depends on $E$ and $H$, even without viscosity, because the internal hardening variable evolves under the consistency condition.**\nThis statement is incorrect. The concept of \"exponential decay\" and a \"characteristic time\" is a feature of viscous (rate-dependent) models. The provided model is explicitly rate-independent and has no intrinsic time scale. The derivation showed that the internal hardening variable ceases to evolve ($\\dot{\\alpha}=0$) because plastic flow stops. This statement is **Incorrect**.\n\n**C. Stress relaxes only if the state at the start of the hold is strictly on the yield surface; otherwise it is constant. If on the yield surface, it relaxes to a value strictly below the instantaneous yield stress.**\nThe problem specifies that plastic yielding occurred, so the state at the start of the hold is indeed on the yield surface ($\\Phi=0$). However, the derivation shows that even in this case, stress does *not* relax. The premise \"If on the yield surface, it relaxes\" is false. Therefore, the statement is **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. Replacing isotropic hardening with linear kinematic hardening permits stress relaxation at constant strain, because the backstress evolves even without viscosity.**\nThis statement is incorrect. The analysis for linear kinematic hardening was performed explicitly and led to the same conclusion as for isotropic hardening: $\\dot{\\varepsilon}^p = 0$ and $\\dot{\\sigma}=0$. The backstress $\\xi$ does not evolve because its rate, $\\dot{\\xi} = H_k \\dot{\\varepsilon}^p$, is zero. This statement is **Incorrect**.\n\n**E. The absence of stress relaxation is a direct consequence of rate independence (no intrinsic time scale) and the complementarity conditions; allowing relaxation requires introducing a viscous mechanism (for example, a viscoplastic overstress law or a viscoelastic branch).**\nThis statement provides the correct fundamental explanation for the result. The elastoplastic tangent modulus relates rates, $\\dot{\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}} = \\mathbf{C}^{ep} : \\dot{\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}}$. In a rate-independent framework, if the input rate $\\dot{\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}}$ is zero, the output rate $\\dot{\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}}$ must also be zero. The KKT/complementarity conditions are the mathematical formulation ensuring that no plastic flow can occur if it would lead to a stress state inside the yield surface, which is what relaxation would do. The statement correctly identifies that time-dependent phenomena like relaxation necessitate a viscous component (e.g., viscoplasticity, where flow rate depends on overstress $\\Phi0$, or viscoelasticity) to provide a mechanism for energy dissipation and internal state evolution over time at a fixed macroscopic configuration. This statement is **Correct**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{AE}$$", "id": "2673816"}]}
