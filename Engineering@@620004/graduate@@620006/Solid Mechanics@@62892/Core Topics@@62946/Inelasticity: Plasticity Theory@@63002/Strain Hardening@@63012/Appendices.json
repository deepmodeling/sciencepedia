It represents a standard calculation in the theory of plasticity. I will proceed with the solution.\n\nThe solution begins with the derivation of the relationship between the critical resolved shear stress, $\\tau$, and the dislocation density, $\\rho$.\n\nConsider a mobile dislocation line moving on its slip plane. Its path is obstructed by \"forest\" dislocations that pierce the slip plane. These intersections act as pinning points. Let the average spacing between these pinning points be $L$. In a randomly distributed forest of dislocations with a total line length per unit volume of $\\rho$, a simple geometric argument shows that the average spacing between intersections on a plane is inversely proportional to the square root of the dislocation density. Thus, we have the scaling:\n$$ L \\propto \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\rho}} $$\nAn applied resolved shear stress $\\tau$ on the slip system exerts a Peach-Koehler force per unit length, $f$, on the dislocation, given by $f = \\tau b$, where $b$ is the magnitude of the Burgers vector. This force acts on the segment of length $L$ between two pinning points, causing it to bow out.\n\nThe dislocation line possesses a line tension, $T$, which is its energy per unit length. This line tension opposes the bowing and acts to keep the line straight, analogous to the tension in a string. The line tension is proportional to the shear modulus $\\mu$ and the square of the Burgers vector magnitude, typically approximated as $T \\approx \\frac{1}{2}\\mu b^2$.\n\nFor the bowed segment to be in mechanical equilibrium, the force exerted by the applied stress must be balanced by the restoring force from the line tension. If the segment bows into a circular arc of radius $R$, the equilibrium condition is given by:\n$$ \\tau b L = 2T \\sin(\\theta) $$\nwhere $2\\theta$ is the angle of the arc at the center of curvature. From geometry, the length of the chord is $L = 2R\\sin(\\theta)$. Substituting this into the force balance equation leads to a simplified relation independent of the angle $\\theta$:\n$$ \\tau b (2R\\sin(\\theta)) = 2T \\sin(\\theta) \\implies \\tau = \\frac{T}{bR} $$\nPlastic flow occurs when the dislocation breaks free from its pinning points. This happens at a critical stress, $\\tau_{crss}$, when the bowing becomes unstable. The maximum resistive force from the pinning points is overcome when the bow-out reaches a minimum radius of curvature. This critical configuration is a semicircle, for which the radius of curvature is $R_{min} = L/2$.\n\nSubstituting this critical radius into the equilibrium equation gives the critical resolved shear stress:\n$$ \\tau \\equiv \\tau_{crss} = \\frac{T}{b R_{min}} = \\frac{T}{b(L/2)} = \\frac{2T}{bL} $$\nNow, we substitute the dependencies for $T$ and $L$. Using $T \\propto \\mu b^2$ and $L \\propto 1/\\sqrt{\\rho}$, we find the scaling:\n$$ \\tau \\propto \\frac{\\mu b^2}{b(1/\\sqrt{\\rho})} = \\mu b \\sqrt{\\rho} $$\nThis is the famous Taylor hardening relationship. The proportionality constant, denoted as $\\alpha$ in the problem, is a dimensionless coefficient of order unity (typically $0.2-0.5$) that incorporates the geometric factors in the expressions for $L$ and $T$, as well as the strength of the dislocation junction interaction. The equation is thus written as:\n$$ \\tau = \\alpha \\mu b \\sqrt{\\rho} $$\nThis completes the requested derivation of the scaling.\n\nThe next step is to relate this microscopic critical resolved shear stress on a slip system to the macroscopic uniaxial flow stress, $\\sigma$, of the polycrystal. For a polycrystal with randomly oriented grains, the Taylor factor, $M$, provides this connection. It represents the average geometric factor required to accommodate plastic strain by slip on multiple slip systems in each grain. The relation is:\n$$ \\sigma = M \\tau $$\nCombining the two equations gives the expression for the flow stress:\n$$ \\sigma = M \\alpha \\mu b \\sqrt{\\rho} $$\nNow, we must calculate the numerical value for $\\sigma$ using the provided parameters. The parameters must first be converted to a consistent set of SI units (meters, Pascals, etc.).\n-   $M = 3.06$ (dimensionless)\n-   $\\alpha = 0.35$ (dimensionless)\n-   $\\mu = 26 \\text{ GPa} = 26 \\times 10^9 \\text{ Pa}$\n-   $b = 0.286 \\text{ nm} = 0.286 \\times 10^{-9} \\text{ m}$\n-   $\\rho = 2.5 \\times 10^{14} \\text{ m}^{-2}$\n\nSubstituting these values into the expression for $\\sigma$:\n$$ \\sigma = (3.06)(0.35)(26 \\times 10^9 \\text{ Pa})(0.286 \\times 10^{-9} \\text{ m}) \\sqrt{2.5 \\times 10^{14} \\text{ m}^{-2}} $$\nFirst, evaluate the square root term:\n$$ \\sqrt{2.5 \\times 10^{14} \\text{ m}^{-2}} = \\sqrt{2.5} \\times 10^7 \\text{ m}^{-1} \\approx 1.5811388 \\times 10^7 \\text{ m}^{-1} $$\nNow, substitute this back into the main equation:\n$$ \\sigma = (3.06)(0.35)(26 \\times 10^9)(0.286 \\times 10^{-9})(1.5811388 \\times 10^7) \\text{ Pa} $$\nThe terms $10^9$ and $10^{-9}$ cancel.

Therefore, at the beginning of Step $2$, the material has a yield stress of $\\sigma_y = 300~\\mathrm{MPa}$.\n\nStep $2$ involves applying a pure shear stress $\\tau$ starting from the stress-free state. For a state of pure shear, the stress tensor in a suitable coordinate system is $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & \\tau & 0 \\\\ \\tau & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$.

The translation is described by the backstress tensor, $\\boldsymbol{\\alpha}$. The yield condition is:\n$$\nf = \\sqrt{\\frac{3}{2}(\\mathbf{s} - \\boldsymbol{\\alpha}):(\\mathbf{s} - \\boldsymbol{\\alpha})} - \\sigma_{y0} = 0\n$$\nThe evolution of the backstress is given by the Prager rule:\n$$\n\\mathrm{d}\\boldsymbol{\\alpha} = \\frac{2}{3} C \\, \\mathrm{d}\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}^{p}\n$$\nwhere $\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}^{p}$ is the plastic strain tensor.\n\nStep $1$ is uniaxial tension along, say, the $1$-axis. For monotonic loading, the backstress tensor can be found by integrating the evolution law: $\\boldsymbol{\\alpha} = \\frac{2}{3} C \\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}^{p}$.\nFor uniaxial tension, the plastic strain tensor has the form $\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}^{p} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\varepsilon_{11}^p & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -\\frac{1}{2}\\varepsilon_{11}^p & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & -\\frac{1}{2}\\varepsilon_{11}^p \\end{pmatrix}$ due to plastic incompressibility ($\\mathrm{tr}(\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}^{p}) = 0$).\nThe accumulated equivalent plastic strain $p$ is related to the component $\\varepsilon_{11}^p$ for monotonic uniaxial tension by $p = \\varepsilon_{11}^p$. This can be shown from the definition $p = \\int\\sqrt{\\frac{2}{3}\\mathrm{d}\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}^p:\\mathrm{d}\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}^p}$.\nAt the end of Step $1$, $p=p_1$, so $\\varepsilon_{11}^p = p_1$.

This condition is found by setting the derivative of the load $P$ with respect to the strain $\\epsilon$ equal to zero:\n$$\n\\frac{dP}{d\\epsilon} = 0\n$$\nWe compute the derivative of $P(\\epsilon)$ using the product rule:\n$$\n\\frac{dP}{d\\epsilon} = K A_{0} \\frac{d}{d\\epsilon} \\left( \\epsilon^{n} \\exp(-\\epsilon) \\right) = K A_{0} \\left[ \\left( n \\epsilon^{n-1} \\right) \\exp(-\\epsilon) + \\epsilon^{n} \\left( -\\exp(-\\epsilon) \\right) \\right]\n$$\nFactoring out common terms:\n$$\n\\frac{dP}{d\\epsilon} = K A_{0} \\exp(-\\epsilon) \\epsilon^{n-1} (n - \\epsilon)\n$$\nFor $\\frac{dP}{d\\epsilon} = 0$, given that $K > 0$, $A_{0} > 0$, $\\exp(-\\epsilon) > 0$, and plastic strain $\\epsilon > 0$ (implying $\\epsilon^{n-1}$ is finite and non-zero for $n \\in (0,1)$), the only non-trivial solution is:\n$$\nn - \\epsilon = 0\n$$\nThus, the uniform true strain at the onset of necking, $\\epsilon_{u}$, is:\n$$\n\\epsilon_{u} = n\n$$\nThis is the well-known Considère's criterion for necking instability in a material following the Hollomon law.\n\n(c) Fisher Information Matrix (FIM) and its determinant.\nThe statistical model is given in linearized form:\n$$\n\\ln \\sigma_{i} = \\ln K + n \\ln \\epsilon_{i} + e_{i}\n$$\nwhere $e_{i} \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0, s^{2})$ are independent and identically distributed Gaussian errors. Let $y_{i} = \\ln \\sigma_{i}$, $\\alpha = \\ln K$, and $x_{i} = \\ln \\epsilon_{i}$. The model becomes a simple linear regression:\n$$\ny_{i} = \\alpha + n x_{i} + e_{i}\n$$\nThe parameter vector is $\\boldsymbol{\\theta} = (\\alpha, n)^{\\top}$. The log-likelihood function for the entire dataset of $N$ observations is the sum of the individual log-likelihoods:\n$$\n\\ell(\\boldsymbol{\\theta} | \\mathbf{y}, \\mathbf{x}) = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\ell_{i}(\\boldsymbol{\\theta} | y_{i}, x_{i}) = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\left[ -\\frac{1}{2} \\ln(2\\pi s^{2}) - \\frac{(y_{i} - \\alpha - n x_{i})^{2}}{2s^{2}} \\right]\n$$\nThe Fisher Information Matrix $\\mathrm{FIM}$ for $\\boldsymbol{\\theta}$ is a $2 \\times 2$ matrix whose elements $I_{jk}$ are given by $I_{jk} = -E\\left[\\frac{\\partial^{2}\\ell}{\\partial\\theta_{j}\\partial\\theta_{k}}\\right]$. For a linear model with Gaussian noise, where the regressors are non-stochastic, this simplifies because the second derivatives are not functions of the data $y_{i}$.\n\nFirst, we find the second partial derivatives of the log-likelihood function $\\ell$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial\\ell}{\\partial\\alpha} = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\frac{y_{i} - \\alpha - n x_{i}}{s^{2}} \\implies \\frac{\\partial^{2}\\ell}{\\partial\\alpha^{2}} = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} -\\frac{1}{s^{2}} = -\\frac{N}{s^{2}}\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial\\ell}{\\partial n} = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\frac{x_{i}(y_{i} - \\alpha - n x_{i})}{s^{2}} \\implies \\frac{\\partial^{2}\\ell}{\\partial n^{2}} = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} -\\frac{x_{i}^{2}}{s^{2}} = -\\frac{1}{s^{2}}\\sum_{i=1}^{N} x_{i}^{2}\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial^{2}\\ell}{\\partial\\alpha\\partial n} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial n} \\left( \\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\frac{y_{i} - \\alpha - n x_{i}}{s^{2}} \\right) = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} -\\frac{x_{i}}{s^{2}} = -\\frac{1}{s^{2}}\\sum_{i=1}^{N} x_{i}\n$$\nThe elements of the FIM are the negative of these second derivatives (as they are constants, the expectation operator has no effect):\n$$\nI_{\\alpha\\alpha} = - \\left(-\\frac{N}{s^{2}}\\right) = \\frac{N}{s^{2}}\n$$\n$$\nI_{nn} = - \\left(-\\frac{1}{s^{2}}\\sum_{i=1}^{N} x_{i}^{2}\\right) = \\frac{1}{s^{2}}\\sum_{i=1}^{N} x_{i}^{2}\n$$\n$$\nI_{\\alpha n} = I_{n\\alpha} = - \\left(-\\frac{1}{s^{2}}\\sum_{i=1}^{N} x_{i}\\right) = \\frac{1}{s^{2}}\\sum_{i=1}^{N} x_{i}\n$$\nAssembling these components into the matrix gives the FIM:\n$$\n\\mathrm{FIM} = \\begin{pmatrix} I_{\\alpha\\alpha} & I_{\\alpha n} \\\\ I_{n\\alpha} & I_{nn} \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{1}{s^{2}} \\begin{pmatrix} N & \\sum_{i=1}^{N} x_{i} \\\\ \\sum_{i=1}^{N} x_{i} & \\sum_{i=1}^{N} x_{i}^{2} \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nNext, we compute the determinant of the FIM:\n$$\n\\det(\\mathrm{FIM}) = \\det\\left[ \\frac{1}{s^{2}} \\begin{pmatrix} N & \\sum_{i=1}^{N} x_{i} \\\\ \\sum_{i=1}^{N} x_{i} & \\sum_{i=1}^{N} x_{i}^{2} \\end{pmatrix} \\right]\n$$\nUsing the property $\\det(c \\mathbf{A}) = c^{m} \\det(\\mathbf{A})$ for an $m \\times m$ matrix $\\mathbf{A}$:\n$$\n\\det(\\mathrm{FIM}) = \\left(\\frac{1}{s^{2}}\\right)^{2} \\det \\begin{pmatrix} N & \\sum_{i=1}^{N} x_{i} \\\\ \\sum_{i=1}^{N} x_{i} & \\sum_{i=1}^{N} x_{i}^{2} \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\n$$\n\\det(\\mathrm{FIM}) = \\frac{1}{s^{4}} \\left( N \\left(\\sum_{i=1}^{N} x_{i}^{2}\\right) - \\left(\\sum_{i=1}^{N} x_{i}\\right)^{2} \\right)\n$$\nThis is the required closed-form expression.\n\nFor the discussion on local identifiability: The parameters $\\alpha = \\ln K$ and $n$ are locally identifiable if the FIM is invertible, which requires $\\det(\\mathrm{FIM}) \\neq 0$. The expression for the determinant can be rewritten using the sample variance of the $x_i$ values. Let $\\bar{x} = \\frac{1}{N}\\sum_{i=1}^{N} x_{i}$. Then $N \\sum x_{i}^{2} - (\\sum x_{i})^{2} = N \\sum (x_{i} - \\bar{x})^{2}$. Thus:\n$$\n\\det(\\mathrm{FIM}) = \\frac{N}{s^{4}} \\sum_{i=1}^{N} (x_{i} - \\bar{x})^{2}\n$$\nThis determinant is zero if and only if $\\sum_{i=1}^{N} (x_{i}-\\bar{x})^{2} = 0$, which occurs only if all $x_{i}$ are identical. Since $x_{i} = \\ln \\epsilon_{i}$, this means all strain measurements $\\epsilon_{i}$ would have to be the same. Testing at a single strain value makes it impossible to determine both the intercept and slope of the line in the log-log plot, hence $\\ln K$ and $n$ are not identifiable.\nThe magnitude of $\\det(\\mathrm{FIM})$ quantifies the information content. A larger determinant implies lower variance for the parameter estimates (by the Cramér-Rao bound) and better identifiability.\n1.  **Breadth of the strain interval**: A wider interval $[\\epsilon_{\\min}, \\epsilon_{\\max}]$ allows for a larger spread in the $x_i = \\ln \\epsilon_i$ values. This increases the sum of squared deviations $\\sum (x_{i}-\\bar{x})^{2}$, which in turn increases $\\det(\\mathrm{FIM})$. Therefore, a wider experimental strain range improves parameter identifiability and precision.\n2.  **Distribution of $\\{\\epsilon_{i}\\}$**: For a fixed interval, the distribution of points matters. To maximize $\\det(\\mathrm{FIM})$, one must maximize the variance of the $x_i$ values. This is achieved by concentrating the experimental points at the extremes of the logarithmic strain interval, $[\\ln \\epsilon_{\\min}, \\ln \\epsilon_{\\max}]$. An optimal design would place half the measurements at $\\epsilon_{\\min}$ and the other half at $\\epsilon_{\\max}$.\n\nThe three requested expressions are now determined.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} K n \\epsilon^{n-1} & n & \\frac{1}{s^4} \\left( N \\sum_{i=1}^N x_i^2 - \\left(\\sum_{i=1}^N x_i\\right)^2 \\right) \\end{pmatrix}}\n$$", "id": "2689181"}]}
