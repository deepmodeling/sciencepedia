It is a valid problem in solid mechanics. We proceed to the solution.\n\n### Solution Derivation\nThe problem requires finding the slope of a stress path tangent to the von Mises yield surface at a given stress state. A stress path tangent to the yield surface corresponds to neutral loading. For a material point with stress state $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}$ on the yield surface ($f(\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}) = 0$), any subsequent evolution must satisfy the consistency condition, which states that the rate of change of the yield function must be non-positive, $\\dot{f} \\le 0$. If plastic flow occurs ($\\dot{\\lambda} > 0$), the state must remain on the yield surface, which requires $\\dot{f} = 0$. For neutral loading, where the stress increment is tangential to the yield surface, we also have $\\dot{f} = 0$, but with $\\dot{\\lambda} = 0$.\n\nThe condition $\\dot{f}=0$ is expressed using the chain rule as:\n$$ \\dot{f} = \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial \\boldsymbol{\\sigma}} : \\dot{\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}} = 0 $$\nwhere $\\dot{\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}}$ is the stress rate tensor and ':' denotes the double dot product. This equation defines the tangent plane to the yield surface at $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}$. Any stress rate $\\dot{\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}}$ satisfying this condition represents a neutral loading direction.\n\nFor computational convenience, we use an equivalent form of the yield function based on the second invariant of the deviatoric stress, $J_{2} = \\frac{1}{2} s_{ij}s_{ij} = \\frac{1}{2} \\boldsymbol{s}:\\boldsymbol{s}$. The von Mises yield criterion $f(\\boldsymbol{\\sigma})=0$ is equivalent to $3J_{2} = \\sigma_{y}^{2}$. Since $\\sigma_{y}$ is constant (perfect plasticity), we can define a yield function $g(\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}) = J_{2} - \\frac{\\sigma_{y}^{2}}{3} = 0$. The consistency condition is then $\\dot{g}=0$.\n$$ \\dot{g} = \\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial \\boldsymbol{\\sigma}} : \\dot{\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}} = \\frac{\\partial J_{2}}{\\partial \\boldsymbol{\\sigma}} : \\dot{\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}} = 0 $$\nWe must first compute the gradient of $J_{2}$ with respect to the stress tensor $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}$. In component form:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial J_{2}}{\\partial \\sigma_{kl}} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\sigma_{kl}} \\left( \\frac{1}{2} s_{ij}s_{ij} \\right) = s_{ij} \\frac{\\partial s_{ij}}{\\partial \\sigma_{kl}} $$\nThe deviatoric stress components are given by $s_{ij} = \\sigma_{ij} - \\frac{1}{3}\\delta_{ij}\\sigma_{pp}$, where $\\delta_{ij}$ is the Kronecker delta. Its derivative with respect to $\\sigma_{kl}$ is:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial s_{ij}}{\\partial \\sigma_{kl}} = \\frac{\\partial \\sigma_{ij}}{\\partial \\sigma_{kl}} - \\frac{1}{3}\\delta_{ij} \\frac{\\partial \\sigma_{pp}}{\\partial \\sigma_{kl}} = \\delta_{ik}\\delta_{jl} - \\frac{1}{3}\\delta_{ij}\\delta_{kl} $$\nSubstituting this back into the expression for the gradient of $J_{2}$:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial J_{2}}{\\partial \\sigma_{kl}} = s_{ij} \\left( \\delta_{ik}\\delta_{jl} - \\frac{1}{3}\\delta_{ij}\\delta_{kl} \\right) = s_{kl} - \\frac{1}{3}\\delta_{kl} s_{ii} $$\nBy definition, the trace of the deviatoric stress tensor is zero ($s_{ii}=0$). Therefore, the gradient simplifies to:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial J_{2}}{\\partial \\boldsymbol{\\sigma}} = \\boldsymbol{s} $$\nThe necessary condition for neutral loading is thus reduced to the elegant statement that the stress rate tensor must be orthogonal to the deviatoric stress tensor:\n$$ \\boldsymbol{s} : \\dot{\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}} = 0 $$\nIn component form, this is $s_{ij} \\dot{\\sigma}_{ij} = 0$.\n\nWe now apply this condition to the specific state given in the problem. The deviatoric stress tensor at time $t_{0}$ was previously calculated as:\n$$ \\boldsymbol{s}(t_{0}) = \\begin{pmatrix} 100  0  0 \\\\ 0  -20  0 \\\\ 0  0  -80 \\end{pmatrix} \\text{MPa} $$\nThe problem specifies a stress path in the $(\\sigma_{11}, \\sigma_{22})$ plane. This implies that only the $\\sigma_{11}$ and $\\sigma_{22}$ components of stress are changing. The stress rate tensor $\\dot{\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}}$ therefore has the form:\n$$ \\dot{\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\dot{\\sigma}_{11}  0  0 \\\\ 0  \\dot{\\sigma}_{22}  0 \\\\ 0  0  0 \\end{pmatrix} $$\nThe condition for neutral loading $s_{ij}\\dot{\\sigma}_{ij}=0$ becomes:\n$$ s_{11}\\dot{\\sigma}_{11} + s_{22}\\dot{\\sigma}_{22} + s_{33}\\dot{\\sigma}_{33} + 2s_{12}\\dot{\\sigma}_{12} + \\dots = 0 $$\nSubstituting the known components of $\\boldsymbol{s}$ and $\\dot{\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}}$:\n$$ (100) \\dot{\\sigma}_{11} + (-20) \\dot{\\sigma}_{22} + (-80)(0) + 2(0)(0) + \\dots = 0 $$\n$$ 100 \\dot{\\sigma}_{11} - 20 \\dot{\\sigma}_{22} = 0 $$\nThe problem asks for the slope $m = \\left.\\dfrac{d \\sigma_{22}}{d \\sigma_{11}}\\right|_{t_{0}}$. This slope is equivalent to the ratio of the rates, $\\dfrac{\\dot{\\sigma}_{22}}{\\dot{\\sigma}_{11}}$. From the equation above, we rearrange to find this ratio:\n$$ 20 \\dot{\\sigma}_{22} = 100 \\dot{\\sigma}_{11} $$\n$$ m = \\frac{\\dot{\\sigma}_{22}}{\\dot{\\sigma}_{11}} = \\frac{100}{20} = 5 $$\nThe slope of the stress path tangent to the von Mises yield surface at the specified point is $5$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{5}$$", "id": "2655753"}, {"introduction": "Our final practice bridges the gap between continuum theory and computational implementation, a critical step for modern engineering analysis.

The formulation presented is the standard, textbook model for rate-independent $J_2$ plasticity (von Mises plasticity) with linear isotropic hardening, formulated in the space of deviatoric stress. The yield function $f(\\boldsymbol{\\tau}, \\alpha) = \\|\\boldsymbol{\\tau}\\| - \\sqrt{\\frac{2}{3}} R(\\alpha) = 0$, with $R(\\alpha) = \\sigma_{y0} + H \\alpha$, is equivalent to the classical form $\\sqrt{3 J_2} - R(\\alpha) = 0$, since $J_2 = \\frac{1}{2} \\boldsymbol{\\tau}:\\boldsymbol{\\tau} = \\frac{1}{2} \\|\\boldsymbol{\\tau}\\|^2$. The hardening law, $\\Delta \\alpha = \\sqrt{\\frac{2}{3}} \\Delta \\lambda$, is consistent with the standard definition of the increment of equivalent plastic strain, $\\Delta\\bar{\\varepsilon}^p = \\sqrt{\\frac{2}{3} \\Delta \\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}^p : \\Delta \\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}^p}$, given the associative flow rule where $\\mathbf{n}$ is a unit vector. The problem is well-posed, objective, self-contained, and poses a non-trivial but standard task in computational solid mechanics. It asks for the derivation of a well-known algorithm.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem statement is valid. A full derivation and evaluation of options will be performed.\n\n---\n\nThe objective is to derive the return-mapping algorithm for the given elastoplastic model. The procedure is based on an elastic trial step followed by a plastic correction if the trial state violates the yield condition. All quantities at the beginning of the increment (step $n$) are known: $\\boldsymbol{\\tau}_{n}$, $\\alpha_{n}$. The total strain increment $\\Delta \\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}$ is given.\n\n**1. Elastic Predictor (Trial State)**\nFirst, we assume the entire strain increment is purely elastic, meaning the plastic strain increment $\\Delta \\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}^{p}$ is zero.\nThe trial stress increment is computed from the elastic law:\n$$ \\Delta \\boldsymbol{\\tau}_{\\text{tr}} = 2 G \\Delta \\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}^{\\text{dev}} $$\nThe trial deviatoric stress at the end of the step $n+1$ is then:\n$$ \\boldsymbol{\\tau}_{\\text{tr}} = \\boldsymbol{\\tau}_{n} + \\Delta \\boldsymbol{\\tau}_{\\text{tr}} = \\boldsymbol{\\tau}_{n} + 2 G \\Delta \\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}^{\\text{dev}} $$\nThe internal hardening variable remains unchanged during the trial step: $\\alpha_{\\text{tr}} = \\alpha_{n}$.\n\n**2. Yield Check and Loading Classification**\nWe check if this trial state is admissible by evaluating the yield function $f$.\n$$ f_{\\text{tr}} = f(\\boldsymbol{\\tau}_{\\text{tr}}, \\alpha_{n}) = \\|\\boldsymbol{\\tau}_{\\text{tr}}\\| - \\sqrt{\\tfrac{2}{3}} \\left( \\sigma_{y0} + H \\alpha_{n} \\right) $$\nTwo cases arise:\n- If $f_{\\text{tr}} \\le 0$, the trial state is inside or on the yield surface. The elastic assumption is correct. The step is elastic. We set the state at $n+1$ to the trial state:\n  $$ \\boldsymbol{\\tau}_{n+1} = \\boldsymbol{\\tau}_{\\text{tr}} $$\n  $$ \\alpha_{n+1} = \\alpha_{n} $$\n  This implies $\\Delta \\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}^{p} = \\mathbf{0}$ and thus the plastic multiplier $\\Delta \\lambda = 0$. This covers elastic loading within the yield surface, elastic unloading from a yielded state ($f(\\boldsymbol{\\tau}_n,\\alpha_n)=0, f_{\\text{tr}}0$), and neutral loading ($f(\\boldsymbol{\\tau}_n,\\alpha_n)=0, f_{\\text{tr}}=0$).\n- If $f_{\\text{tr}} > 0$, the trial state is outside the yield surface, which is physically inadmissible. The elastic assumption is incorrect, and plastic flow must occur. This is the plastic loading case.\n\n**3. Plastic Corrector**\nFor the case of plastic loading ($f_{\\text{tr}} > 0$), we must find the final state $(\\boldsymbol{\\tau}_{n+1}, \\alpha_{n+1})$ which lies on the updated yield surface. The stress is updated using the full constitutive relation:\n$$ \\boldsymbol{\\tau}_{n+1} = \\boldsymbol{\\tau}_{n} + 2 G (\\Delta \\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}^{\\text{dev}} - \\Delta \\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}^{p}) $$\nSubstituting $\\boldsymbol{\\tau}_{\\text{tr}} = \\boldsymbol{\\tau}_{n} + 2 G \\Delta \\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}^{\\text{dev}}$, we get:\n$$ \\boldsymbol{\\tau}_{n+1} = \\boldsymbol{\\tau}_{\\text{tr}} - 2 G \\Delta \\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}^{p} $$\nUsing the associative flow rule $\\Delta \\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}^{p} = \\Delta \\lambda \\, \\mathbf{n}$, with $\\mathbf{n} = \\boldsymbol{\\tau}_{n+1} / \\|\\boldsymbol{\\tau}_{n+1}\\|$ evaluated at the final state:\n$$ \\boldsymbol{\\tau}_{n+1} = \\boldsymbol{\\tau}_{\\text{tr}} - 2 G \\Delta \\lambda \\frac{\\boldsymbol{\\tau}_{n+1}}{\\|\\boldsymbol{\\tau}_{n+1}\\|} $$\nRearranging this equation shows that $\\boldsymbol{\\tau}_{n+1}$ and $\\boldsymbol{\\tau}_{\\text{tr}}$ are co-linear:\n$$ \\boldsymbol{\\tau}_{\\text{tr}} = \\boldsymbol{\\tau}_{n+1} \\left( 1 + \\frac{2 G \\Delta \\lambda}{\\|\\boldsymbol{\\tau}_{n+1}\\|} \\right) $$\nThis means they have the same direction, so their unit normal vectors are identical:\n$$ \\mathbf{n} = \\frac{\\boldsymbol{\\tau}_{n+1}}{\\|\\boldsymbol{\\tau}_{n+1}\\|} = \\frac{\\boldsymbol{\\tau}_{\\text{tr}}}{\\|\\boldsymbol{\\tau}_{\\text{tr}}\\|} $$\nThis is the principle of radial return for $J_2$ plasticity. We can thus write the stress update explicitly as:\n$$ \\boldsymbol{\\tau}_{n+1} = \\boldsymbol{\\tau}_{\\text{tr}} - 2 G \\Delta \\lambda \\frac{\\boldsymbol{\\tau}_{\\text{tr}}}{\\|\\boldsymbol{\\tau}_{\\text{tr}}\\|} $$\nThe internal variable is updated according to the hardening law:\n$$ \\alpha_{n+1} = \\alpha_{n} + \\Delta \\alpha = \\alpha_{n} + \\sqrt{\\tfrac{2}{3}} \\Delta \\lambda $$\n\n**4. Consistency Condition and $\\Delta \\lambda$**\nThe final state must lie on the yield surface, so it must satisfy the consistency condition $f(\\boldsymbol{\\tau}_{n+1}, \\alpha_{n+1}) = 0$.\n$$ \\|\\boldsymbol{\\tau}_{n+1}\\| - \\sqrt{\\tfrac{2}{3}} \\left( \\sigma_{y0} + H \\alpha_{n+1} \\right) = 0 $$\nWe need an expression for $\\|\\boldsymbol{\\tau}_{n+1}\\|$. Taking the norm of the stress update equation:\n$$ \\|\\boldsymbol{\\tau}_{n+1}\\| = \\left\\| \\left(1 - \\frac{2G\\Delta\\lambda}{\\|\\boldsymbol{\\tau}_{\\text{tr}}\\|} \\right)\\boldsymbol{\\tau}_{\\text{tr}} \\right\\| = \\left(1 - \\frac{2G\\Delta\\lambda}{\\|\\boldsymbol{\\tau}_{\\text{tr}}\\|} \\right) \\|\\boldsymbol{\\tau}_{\\text{tr}}\\| = \\|\\boldsymbol{\\tau}_{\\text{tr}}\\| - 2G\\Delta\\lambda $$\nThe absolute value is removed because the return map ensures the term in parenthesis is positive. Substituting $\\|\\boldsymbol{\\tau}_{n+1}\\|$ and $\\alpha_{n+1}$ into the consistency condition:\n$$ (\\|\\boldsymbol{\\tau}_{\\text{tr}}\\| - 2G\\Delta\\lambda) - \\sqrt{\\tfrac{2}{3}} \\left( \\sigma_{y0} + H \\left(\\alpha_{n} + \\sqrt{\\tfrac{2}{3}}\\Delta\\lambda\\right) \\right) = 0 $$\nWe group terms with and without $\\Delta\\lambda$:\n$$ \\left( \\|\\boldsymbol{\\tau}_{\\text{tr}}\\| - \\sqrt{\\tfrac{2}{3}} (\\sigma_{y0} + H\\alpha_{n}) \\right) - 2G\\Delta\\lambda - \\sqrt{\\tfrac{2}{3}}H\\sqrt{\\tfrac{2}{3}}\\Delta\\lambda = 0 $$\nThe first term is the trial yield value, $f_{\\text{tr}}$. The second and third terms can be combined:\n$$ f_{\\text{tr}} - \\left( 2G + \\tfrac{2}{3}H \\right) \\Delta\\lambda = 0 $$\nSolving for the plastic multiplier $\\Delta\\lambda$:\n$$ \\Delta\\lambda = \\frac{f_{\\text{tr}}}{2G + \\tfrac{2}{3}H} = \\frac{\\|\\boldsymbol{\\tau}_{\\text{tr}}\\| - \\sqrt{\\tfrac{2}{3}}\\left(\\sigma_{y0} + H\\alpha_{n}\\right)}{2G + \\tfrac{2}{3}H} $$\nSince this case is for $f_{\\text{tr}} > 0$, and $G>0, H\\ge 0$, we have $\\Delta\\lambda>0$, consistent with the KKT conditions.\n\n**Evaluation of Options**\n\n**A.**\n- Elastic predictor $\\boldsymbol{\\tau}_{\\text{tr}}=\\boldsymbol{\\tau}_{n} + 2G\\Delta\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}^{\\text{dev}}$: Correct.\n- Trial yield value $f_{\\text{tr}}=\\|\\boldsymbol{\\tau}_{\\text{tr}}\\|-\\sqrt{\\tfrac{2}{3}}(\\sigma_{y0}+H\\alpha_n)$: Correct.\n- Loading classification based on $f_{\\text{tr}}$: Correct.\n- Plastic corrector using $\\mathbf{n}=\\boldsymbol{\\tau}_{\\text{tr}}/\\|\\boldsymbol{\\tau}_{\\text{tr}}\\|$ and $\\boldsymbol{\\tau}_{n+1}=\\boldsymbol{\\tau}_{\\text{tr}}-2G\\Delta\\lambda\\mathbf{n}$: Correct.\n- Hardening update $\\alpha_{n+1}=\\alpha_n+\\sqrt{\\tfrac{2}{3}}\\Delta\\lambda$: Correct.\n- Closed-form $\\Delta\\lambda = \\frac{\\|\\boldsymbol{\\tau}_{\\text{tr}}\\|-\\sqrt{\\tfrac{2}{3}}(\\sigma_{y0}+H\\alpha_n)}{2G+\\tfrac{2}{3}H}$: Correct.\nThis option accurately describes the entire algorithm as derived from first principles.\n\nVerdict for A: **Correct**.\n\n**B.**\nThis option proposes a different hardening update: $\\alpha_{n+1}=\\alpha_n+\\Delta\\lambda$. This contradicts the hardening law given in the problem statement ($\\Delta\\alpha=\\sqrt{\\tfrac{2}{3}}\\Delta\\lambda$). Consequently, the derived denominator for $\\Delta\\lambda$ is also incorrect. The correct denominator for $\\Delta\\alpha=\\Delta\\lambda$ would be $2G + H\\sqrt{2/3}$, which is also not what is stated ($2G+H$). This option is incorrect on multiple grounds.\n\nVerdict for B: **Incorrect**.\n\n**C.**\nThis option introduces an alternative, but equivalent, yield function. However, a consistent derivation using this alternative function requires different flow and hardening laws than those used in the option. The option incorrectly mixes elements from different formulations, making the overall procedure invalid.\n\nVerdict for C: **Incorrect**.\n\n**D.**\nThis option provides a formula for $\\Delta\\lambda$ where the hardening modulus $H$ is omitted from the denominator. The expression $\\Delta\\lambda = f_{\\text{tr}} / (2G)$ is the exact solution for the special case of perfect plasticity ($H=0$). For the general case of linear hardening ($H>0$), this is an approximation, not the exact closed-form solution derived from the consistency condition as requested by the problem.\n\nVerdict for D: **Incorrect**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2655731"}]}
