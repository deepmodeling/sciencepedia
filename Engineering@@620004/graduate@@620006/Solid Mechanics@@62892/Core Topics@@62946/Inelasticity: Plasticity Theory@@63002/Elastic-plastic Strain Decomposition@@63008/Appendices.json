[@problem_id:2634470]", "problem": "A slender metallic specimen is subjected to a uniaxial tension experiment under small strains. You are tasked with designing and interpreting an unload–reload segment to separate the elastic strain and plastic strain at a specified deformation state. Assume small-strain kinematics with additive elastic–plastic strain decomposition, and assume that unloading and reloading are purely elastic, linear, and reversible. Neglect machine compliance effects so that the measured unloading slope equals the material’s Young’s modulus.\n\nThe specimen is monotonically loaded to a total engineering strain of $\\varepsilon^{\\ast} = 0.0120$.

It is scientifically grounded in the established theory of plasticity for small strains. The principle of additive strain decomposition is a cornerstone of this theory. The concept of elastic unloading following a linear stress-strain path governed by Young's modulus is also a standard and physically realistic assumption for metals. The provided numerical values for stress, strain, and Young's modulus are consistent and physically plausible for a high-strength metallic alloy such as steel. The problem is well-posed, with sufficient information provided to determine a unique solution for the requested quantities. The language is objective and precise, with no ambiguities. Therefore, a solution can be derived.\n\nThe fundamental premise for this problem is the additive decomposition of the total strain, $\\varepsilon$, into its elastic component, $\\varepsilon^{e}$, and its plastic component, $\\varepsilon^{p}$. Under the small-strain assumption, this is expressed as:\n$$ \\varepsilon = \\varepsilon^{e} + \\varepsilon^{p} $$\nThis decomposition is valid at every point during the deformation history, including the specified state of interest, where the total strain is $\\varepsilon^{\\ast}$ and the stress is $\\sigma^{\\ast}$. Thus, we have:\n$$ \\varepsilon^{\\ast} = \\varepsilon^{e} + \\varepsilon^{p} $$\nHere, $\\varepsilon^{e}$ and $\\varepsilon^{p}$ represent the elastic and plastic strain components, respectively, at the state $(\\varepsilon^{\\ast}, \\sigma^{\\ast})$.\n\nThe problem states that the unloading process is purely elastic and linear. This implies that the elastic strain component, $\\varepsilon^{e}$, is related to the stress, $\\sigma$, through Hooke's Law for uniaxial loading:\n$$ \\sigma = E \\varepsilon^{e} $$\nHere, $E$ is the Young's modulus of the material. This relationship holds for the entire elastic domain, and therefore it must hold at the point of unloading, $(\\varepsilon^{\\ast}, \\sigma^{\\ast})$. The elastic strain at this point is the strain that would be recovered upon complete unloading to zero stress. We can thus solve for the elastic strain, $\\varepsilon^{e}$, at the stress level $\\sigma^{\\ast}$:\n$$ \\varepsilon^{e} = \\frac{\\sigma^{\\ast}}{E} $$\nThis equation provides the means to calculate the elastic part of the total strain $\\varepsilon^{\\ast}$.\n\nWith the expression for $\\varepsilon^{e}$ established, we return to the additive decomposition equation to find the plastic strain component, $\\varepsilon^{p}$:\n$$ \\varepsilon^{p} = \\varepsilon^{\\ast} - \\varepsilon^{e} $$\nSubstituting the expression for $\\varepsilon^{e}$ from Hooke's Law, we obtain the final expression for the plastic strain:\n$$ \\varepsilon^{p} = \\varepsilon^{\\ast} - \\frac{\\sigma^{\\ast}}{E} $$\n\nWe now proceed to evaluate these expressions numerically using the provided data.\nThe given values are:\n- $\\varepsilon^{\\ast} = 0.0120$\n- $\\sigma^{\\ast} = 1.050~\\text{GPa}$\n- $E = 210~\\text{GPa}$\n\nFirst, we calculate the elastic strain, $\\varepsilon^{e}$.
