All provided data ($L$, $E$, $I$, $P$) are physically realistic values for a steel beam. The governing equations for strain energy and total potential energy for an Euler–Bernoulli beam under a point load are stated correctly. The problem is self-contained, objective, and scientifically grounded. It is well-posed and asks for a solution based on first principles, a valid and instructive task. No flaws are detected.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict**\nThe problem is valid. We proceed to the solution.\n\n**Part 1: Construction and Justification of Trial Displacement Field**\nThe Rayleigh–Ritz method requires a trial displacement field $w_t(x;a)$ that is kinematically admissible. For a cantilever beam clamped at $x=0$, the essential (or geometric) boundary conditions are zero displacement and zero slope at the clamp. Thus, the trial field must satisfy:\n1. $w_t(0;a) = 0$\n2. $w_t'(0;a) = 0$\n\nAdditionally, for the strain energy functional $U[w] = \\int_{0}^{L} \\frac{1}{2} E I \\left(w''(x)\\right)^{2} \\, dx$ to be well-defined, the trial function must be twice differentiable on the domain $[0, L]$. Finally, the problem specifies a nonzero displacement at the tip, $w(L) \\neq 0$.\n\nWe seek a simple one-parameter polynomial form $w_t(x;a) = a \\cdot f(x)$. The simplest polynomial that satisfies the boundary conditions is a quadratic function. Let us propose the trial field:\n$$w_t(x; a) = a x^2$$\nWe verify its admissibility. The parameter $a$ is the amplitude to be determined.\n- The first boundary condition is satisfied: $w_t(0;a) = a(0)^2 = 0$.\n- The first derivative is $w_t'(x; a) = 2ax$. The second boundary condition is satisfied: $w_t'(0; a) = 2a(0) = 0$.\n- The second derivative is $w_t''(x; a) = 2a$, which is a constant. The function is infinitely differentiable, thus sufficiently smooth for the energy integral.\n- At the tip, $w_t(L;a) = aL^2$, which is nonzero for $a \\neq 0$.\nThis trial function, $w_t(x; a) = a x^2$, is therefore kinematically admissible.\n\n**Part 2: Total Potential Energy and Minimizing Amplitude**\nWe now express the total potential energy $\\Pi$ as a function of the single parameter $a$.\nFirst, we compute the strain energy $U[a]$ for the trial field $w_t(x;a) = ax^2$:\n$$U[a] = \\int_{0}^{L} \\frac{1}{2} E I \\left(w_t''(x)\\right)^{2} \\, dx = \\int_{0}^{L} \\frac{1}{2} E I (2a)^2 \\, dx$$\n$$U[a] = \\frac{1}{2} E I (4a^2) \\int_{0}^{L} dx = 2 E I a^2 [x]_{0}^{L} = 2 E I a^2 L$$\nNext, we compute the potential energy of the external force $P$, which is $-P$ times the displacement at the point of application, $x=L$:\n$$W_{ext} = -P \\cdot w_t(L;a) = -P(aL^2)$$\nThe total potential energy $\\Pi[a]$ is the sum of the strain energy and the potential energy of the external load:\n$$\\Pi[a] = U[a] + W_{ext} = 2 E I a^2 L - P a L^2$$\nTo find the value of $a$ that minimizes $\\Pi$, we apply the principle of minimum total potential energy, which states that the equilibrium configuration corresponds to a stationary point of $\\Pi$. We differentiate $\\Pi[a]$ with respect to $a$ and set the result to zero:\n$$\\frac{d\\Pi}{da} = \\frac{d}{da} (2 E I a^2 L - P a L^2) = 4 E I a L - P L^2 = 0$$\nSolving for $a$, we find the minimizing amplitude $a_{min}$:\n$$4 E I a_{min} L = P L^2$$\n$$a_{min} = \\frac{P L^2}{4 E I L} = \\frac{P L}{4 E I}$$\nTo confirm this corresponds to a minimum, we check the second derivative:\n$$\\frac{d^2\\Pi}{da^2} = 4 E I L$$\nSince $E$, $I$, and $L$ are all positive physical quantities, $\\frac{d^2\\Pi}{da^2} > 0$, confirming that $a_{min}$ indeed minimizes the total potential energy for this trial field.\n\n**Part 3: Lower or Upper Bound Justification**\nThe principle of minimum total potential energy states that the exact solution $w_e(x)$ minimizes the total potential energy functional $\\Pi[w]$ over the infinite-dimensional space of all kinematically admissible functions. Let this true minimum energy be $\\Pi_{exact} = \\Pi[w_e]$.\n\nThe Rayleigh–Ritz method finds an approximate solution $w_R(x)$ by minimizing the same functional $\\Pi[w]$ over a finite-dimensional subspace of kinematically admissible functions, defined by our choice of trial function $w_t(x;a)$. Since this subspace is a constrained subset of the full space of admissible functions, the minimum found within this subspace must be greater than or equal to the true global minimum. This gives the fundamental inequality:\n$$\\Pi[w_R] \\ge \\Pi[w_e]$$\nFor a linear elastic system subjected to a single concentrated force $P$ at the location where displacement is measured, the total potential energy at equilibrium is related to the displacement at that point, $w(L)$. By Clapeyron's theorem, the strain energy is $U = \\frac{1}{2} P w(L)$. The total potential energy is $\\Pi = U - P w(L) = \\frac{1}{2} P w(L) - P w(L) = -\\frac{1}{2} P w(L)$. This relationship holds for both the exact solution $w_e$ and the Ritz approximation $w_R$.\nSubstituting this into the energy inequality, we obtain:\n$$-\\frac{1}{2} P w_R(L) \\ge -\\frac{1}{2} P w_e(L)$$\nThe problem states that the force $P$ is applied in the positive transverse displacement direction, so $P > 0$. We can multiply the inequality by the negative quantity $-2/P$, which reverses the direction of the inequality:\n$$w_R(L) \\le w_e(L)$$\nThis result demonstrates that the tip displacement predicted by the Rayleigh–Ritz method, $w_R(L)$, is a lower bound to the exact tip displacement, $w_e(L)$. The physical interpretation is that the assumed displacement field ($w_t = ax^2$) imposes an artificial constraint on the beam's deformation, making the mathematical model stiffer than the physical beam. A stiffer structure deflects less under the same load.\n\n**Part 4: Numerical Computation of the Bound**\nThe numerical value of the bound is the calculated Ritz tip displacement, $w_R(L)$. We use the minimizing amplitude $a_{min}$ found previously.\n$$w_R(L) = a_{min} L^2 = \\left(\\frac{P L}{4 E I}\\right) L^2 = \\frac{P L^3}{4 E I}$$\nWe now substitute the given numerical values, ensuring consistent units (SI units: N, m, Pa).\n$P = 5.00 \\text{ kN} = 5.00 \\times 10^3 \\text{ N}$\n$L = 2.4 \\text{ m}$\n$E = 200 \\text{ GPa} = 200 \\times 10^9 \\text{ Pa}$\n$I = 6.00 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}^4$\n\nFirst, compute the flexural rigidity $EI$:\n$$E I = (200 \\times 10^9 \\text{ N/m}^2) (6.00 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}^4) = 1200 \\times 10^3 \\text{ N} \\cdot \\text{m}^2 = 1.20 \\times 10^6 \\text{ N} \\cdot \\text{m}^2$$\nNow, compute the displacement $w_R(L)$:\n$$w_R(L) = \\frac{(5.00 \\times 10^3 \\text{ N}) (2.4 \\text{ m})^3}{4 (1.20 \\times 10^6 \\text{ N} \\cdot \\text{m}^2)} = \\frac{(5.00 \\times 10^3) (13.824)}{4.80 \\times 10^6} \\text{ m}$$\n$$w_R(L) = \\frac{69120}{4.80 \\times 10^6} \\text{ m} = 0.0144 \\text{ m}$$\nThe problem requires the answer in millimeters, rounded to three significant figures.\n$$w_R(L) = 0.0144 \\text{ m} \\times \\frac{1000 \\text{ mm}}{1 \\text{ m}} = 14.4 \\text{ mm}$$\nThis value is already expressed to three significant figures.

The total elastic strain energy $U$ of the beam is the sum of the strain energy due to bending, $U_b$, and the strain energy due to shear, $U_s$. The theorem states that the deflection at the point of application of a force $P$, in the direction of that force, is the partial derivative of the total strain energy with respect to that force.\n$$ \\delta_L = \\frac{\\partial U}{\\partial P} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial P} (U_b + U_s) $$\nThe strain energy components are given by:\n$$ U_b = \\int_0^L \\frac{M(x)^2}{2EI(x)} dx \\quad \\text{and} \\quad U_s = \\int_0^L \\frac{V(x)^2}{2kGA} dx $$\nThe deflection is thus:\n$$ \\delta_L = \\left. \\int_0^L \\frac{M(x)}{EI(x)}\\frac{\\partial M(x)}{\\partial P} dx \\right|_{P=0} + \\left. \\int_0^L \\frac{V(x)}{kGA}\\frac{\\partial V(x)}{\\partial P} dx \\right|_{P=0} $$\nThe fictitious load $P$ is set to zero after differentiation.\n\nTo simplify the calculation of internal forces, we establish a coordinate system with variable $s$ originating at the free end ($s=0$ at $x=L$) and increasing towards the fixed end ($s=L$ at $x=0$).

We must evaluate this integral along the specified loading path.\n\nFirst, we determine the key mechanical properties of the bar.\nThe yield force $P_y$ is the force at which the stress in the bar reaches the yield stress $\\sigma_y$:\n$$\nP_y = \\sigma_y A = (300 \\times 10^6 \\ \\text{Pa}) \\times (100 \\times 10^{-6} \\ \\text{m}^2) = 30000 \\ \\text{N}\n$$\nThe axial stiffness $k$ of the bar in the elastic regime is:\n$$\nk = \\frac{EA}{L} = \\frac{(200 \\times 10^9 \\ \\text{Pa})(100 \\times 10^{-6} \\ \\text{m}^2)}{1.0 \\ \\text{m}} = 20 \\times 10^6 \\ \\text{N/m}\n$$\nThe displacement at the onset of yielding, $u_y$, is:\n$$\nu_y = \\frac{P_y}{k} = \\frac{30000 \\ \\text{N}}{20 \\times 10^6 \\ \\text{N/m}} = 1.5 \\times 10^{-3} \\ \\text{m}\n$$\n\nNow, we compute the work done, $W_{\\text{actual}}$, along the specified two-step loading path.\n\nStep 1: Elastic loading to yield.\nIn this step, $P_2=0$ and $P_1$ is increased from $0$ until the total force $P_{\\text{tot}} = P_1$ reaches $P_y$. The force-displacement relationship is linear, $P_{\\text{tot}}(u) = ku$. The work done, $W^{(1)}$, is the area under the force-displacement curve from $u=0$ to $u=u_y$:\n$$\nW^{(1)} = \\int_0^{u_y} P_{\\text{tot}}(u) \\,du = \\int_0^{u_y} ku \\,du = \\frac{1}{2} k u_y^2 = \\frac{1}{2} P_y u_y\n$$\nSubstituting the values:\n$$\nW^{(1)} = \\frac{1}{2} (30000 \\ \\text{N})(1.5 \\times 10^{-3} \\ \\text{m}) = 22.5 \\ \\text{J}\n$$\n\nStep 2: Plastic deformation at constant total force.\nIn this step, the total force is held constant at the yield force, $P_{\\text{tot}} = P_y = 30000 \\ \\text{N}$, while the displacement is increased by an additional amount $\\Delta u_p = 5.0 \\ \\text{mm} = 5.0 \\times 10^{-3} \\ \\text{m}$. The work done in this step, $W^{(2)}$, is:\n$$\nW^{(2)} = \\int_{u_y}^{u_y + \\Delta u_p} P_{\\text{tot}}(u) \\,du = \\int_{u_y}^{u_y + \\Delta u_p} P_y \\,du = P_y \\Delta u_p\n$$\nSubstituting the values:\n$$\nW^{(2)} = (30000 \\ \\text{N})(5.0 \\times 10^{-3} \\ \\text{m}) = 150 \\ \\text{J}\n$$\n\nThe total actual work done, $W_{\\text{actual}}$, is the sum of the work done in both steps:\n$$\nW_{\\text{actual}} = W^{(1)} + W^{(2)} = 22.5 \\ \\text{J} + 150 \\ \\text{J} = 172.5 \\ \\text{J}\n$$\n\nNext, we compute the counterfactual energy $W_{\\text{lin}}$. This is the work that would be done if the system were linear elastic and brought to the same final state. For a linear elastic system, this work equals the stored strain energy and is given by $W_{\\text{lin}} = \\frac{1}{2} P_{\\text{final}} u_{\\text{final}}$, regardless of the path.\nThe final state is characterized by:\nFinal total force: $P_{\\text{tot}}^f = P_1^f + P_2^f = 10 \\ \\text{kN} + 20 \\ \\text{kN} = 30000 \\ \\text{N}$.\nFinal displacement: $u_f = u_y + \\Delta u_p = 1.5 \\times 10^{-3} \\ \\text{m} + 5.0 \\times 10^{-3} \\ \\text{m} = 6.5 \\times 10^{-3} \\ \\text{m}$.\nThe hypothetical linear elastic work is therefore:\n$$\nW_{\\text{lin}} = \\frac{1}{2} P_{\\text{tot}}^f u_f = \\frac{1}{2} (30000 \\ \\text{N})(6.5 \\times 10^{-3} \\ \\text{m}) = 97.5 \\ \\text{J}\n$$\n\nFinally, we compute the discrepancy $\\Delta W$:\n$$\n\\Delta W = W_{\\text{actual}} - W_{\\text{lin}} = 172.5 \\ \\text{J} - 97.5 \\ \\text{J} = 75.0 \\ \\text{J}\n$$\nThe value $75.0$ is already at three significant figures.\n\nThe assumptions used in the linear elastic estimate $W_{\\text{lin}}$ that are violated in the actual scenario are fundamental:\n1.  **Linear Elastic Material Behavior:** The primary violated assumption is that the material is linear elastic throughout the loading process. The actual material is elastic-perfectly plastic, which is a non-linear, inelastic model.\n2.  **Path-Independence of Work (Conservatism):** A direct consequence of linear elasticity is that the work done is a state function, dependent only on the initial and final states, not the loading path. The system is conservative. For the given plastic material, work is path-dependent. The fact that the loading is non-proportional makes this path dependence explicit, and the calculation shows $W_{\\text{actual}} \\neq W_{\\text{lin}}$. A portion of the work is dissipated as heat due to irreversible plastic deformation, meaning the system is non-conservative. The discrepancy $\\Delta W$ is a direct measure of this path-dependent effect. It can be shown that $\\Delta W = \\frac{1}{2}P_y \\Delta u_p$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{75.0}\n$$", "id": "2881838"}]}
