Methodology: The solution must employ the balance of linear and angular momentum, superposition, Saint-Venant’s principle, and the uniqueness theorem for linear elasticity.\n\nNow, I validate the problem.\nThe problem is a standard exercise in the theory of linear elasticity, specifically concerning the application of Saint-Venant’s principle. It is scientifically grounded, as it is based on the well-established equations of continuum mechanics and linear elasticity. The problem is well-posed; the geometry, material properties, and boundary conditions are specified sufficiently to determine a unique stress field (up to a rigid body motion, which is implicitly constrained). The language used is objective and mathematically precise. The problem is not trivial and directly tests the conceptual understanding of how complex load distributions are treated in the far-field. There are no contradictions or factual errors. Therefore, the problem is declared valid.\n\nThe solution proceeds as follows.\nAccording to Saint-Venant's principle, at a distance from the region of load application that is large compared to the dimensions of the loaded area, the stress field depends only on the statically equivalent resultant force and moment of the applied traction, not on the specific details of the traction distribution.\nThe given traction $t_z(x,y)$ at the end $z=0$ can be replaced by its statically equivalent system, consisting of a resultant force $\\mathbf{F}$ and a resultant moment $\\mathbf{M}_O$ with respect to the centroid of the cross-section, which is at the origin $(0,0,0)$.\n\nThe resultant force is purely axial, $\\mathbf{F} = F_z\\,\\mathbf{e}_z$, where $F_z$ is calculated by integrating the traction over the cross-sectional area $A$, which spans from $x=-a$ to $x=a$ and $y=-b$ to $y=b$.\n$$F_z = \\int_A t_z(x,y) \\,dA = \\int_{-b}^{b} \\int_{-a}^{a} p_0 \\left[ 1 + c_1 \\frac{x}{a} + c_2 \\frac{y}{b} + c_3 \\left( \\frac{x^2}{a^2} - \\frac{y^2}{b^2} \\right) \\right] \\,dx\\,dy$$\nWe evaluate the integral term by term. The integrals of terms containing odd powers of $x$ or $y$ over the symmetric rectangular domain are zero.\n$$ \\int_{-b}^{b} \\int_{-a}^{a} c_1 \\frac{x}{a} \\,dx\\,dy = 0 $$\n$$ \\int_{-b}^{b} \\int_{-a}^{a} c_2 \\frac{y}{b} \\,dx\\,dy = 0 $$\nThe integral of the term with $c_3$ is:\n$$ \\int_{-b}^{b} \\int_{-a}^{a} c_3 \\left( \\frac{x^2}{a^2} - \\frac{y^2}{b^2} \\right) \\,dx\\,dy = c_3 \\left[ \\frac{1}{a^2} \\int_A x^2 \\,dA - \\frac{1}{b^2} \\int_A y^2 \\,dA \\right] = c_3 \\left( \\frac{I_y}{a^2} - \\frac{I_x}{b^2} \\right) $$\nThe moments of inertia for the rectangular cross-section are $I_y = \\int_A x^2 \\,dA = \\frac{4a^3b}{3}$ and $I_x = \\int_A y^2 \\,dA = \\frac{4ab^3}{3}$.\nSubstituting these gives:\n$$ c_3 \\left( \\frac{4a^3b/3}{a^2} - \\frac{4ab^3/3}{b^2} \\right) = c_3 \\left( \\frac{4ab}{3} - \\frac{4ab}{3} \\right) = 0 $$\nThus, the only non-zero contribution to the force is from the constant term:\n$$ F_z = \\int_A p_0 \\,dA = p_0 A = p_0 (2a)(2b) = 4ab p_0 $$\n\nThe resultant moment $\\mathbf{M}_O$ about the origin is $\\mathbf{M}_O = \\int_A \\mathbf{r} \\times \\mathbf{t} \\,dA$, where $\\mathbf{r} = x\\,\\mathbf{e}_x + y\\,\\mathbf{e}_y$ and $\\mathbf{t} = t_z\\,\\mathbf{e}_z$.\n$$ \\mathbf{r} \\times \\mathbf{t} = (x\\,\\mathbf{e}_x + y\\,\\mathbf{e}_y) \\times (t_z\\,\\mathbf{e}_z) = y\\,t_z\\,\\mathbf{e}_x - x\\,t_z\\,\\mathbf{e}_y $$\nThe components of the moment are $M_x = \\int_A y\\,t_z \\,dA$ and $M_y = \\int_A -x\\,t_z \\,dA$.\nFor $M_x$:\n$$ M_x = \\int_A y\\,p_0 \\left[ 1 + c_1 \\frac{x}{a} + c_2 \\frac{y}{b} + c_3 \\left( \\frac{x^2}{a^2} - \\frac{y^2}{b^2} \\right) \\right] \\,dA $$\nThe only term that does not integrate to zero is the one with $y^2$:\n$$ M_x = \\int_A y\\,p_0 \\left( c_2 \\frac{y}{b} \\right) \\,dA = \\frac{p_0 c_2}{b} \\int_A y^2 \\,dA = \\frac{p_0 c_2}{b} I_x = \\frac{p_0 c_2}{b} \\left( \\frac{4ab^3}{3} \\right) = \\frac{4ab^2 c_2 p_0}{3} $$\nFor $M_y$:\n$$ M_y = \\int_A -x\\,p_0 \\left[ 1 + c_1 \\frac{x}{a} + c_2 \\frac{y}{b} + c_3 \\left( \\frac{x^2}{a^2} - \\frac{y^2}{b^2} \\right) \\right] \\,dA $$\nThe only non-zero contribution is from the term with $x^2$:\n$$ M_y = \\int_A -x\\,p_0 \\left( c_1 \\frac{x}{a} \\right) \\,dA = -\\frac{p_0 c_1}{a} \\int_A x^2 \\,dA = -\\frac{p_0 c_1}{a} I_y = -\\frac{p_0 c_1}{a} \\left( \\frac{4a^3b}{3} \\right) = -\\frac{4a^2b c_1 p_0}{3} $$\n\nThe far-field stress state $\\sigma_{zz}(x,y)$ is the one that produces these same resultants. This is the well-known solution for combined axial loading and biaxial bending of a prismatic bar:\n$$ \\sigma_{zz}(x,y) = \\frac{F_z}{A} + \\frac{M_x}{I_x}y - \\frac{M_y}{I_y}x $$\nSubstituting the values for the resultants and geometric properties:\n$$ \\sigma_{zz}(x,y) = \\frac{4ab p_0}{4ab} + \\frac{4ab^2 c_2 p_0/3}{4ab^3/3}y - \\frac{-4a^2b c_1 p_0/3}{4a^3b/3}x $$\n$$ \\sigma_{zz}(x,y) = p_0 + \\frac{c_2 p_0}{b}y + \\frac{c_1 p_0}{a}x $$\n$$ \\sigma_{zz}(x,y) = p_0 \\left( 1 + c_1 \\frac{x}{a} + c_2 \\frac{y}{b} \\right) $$\nThis expression represents the stress field far from the end $z=0$. The uniqueness theorem guarantees this is the correct far-field solution, as the stress field due to the self-equilibrated part of the load, $p_0 c_3 (x^2/a^2 - y^2/b^2)$, must decay with distance from the plane of application, becoming negligible at $z=z_0 \\gg a,b$.\n\nFinally, we evaluate this far-field stress at the specified point $(x^{\\star},y^{\\star}) = \\left(\\frac{a}{2},-\\frac{b}{2}\\right)$:\n$$ \\sigma_{zz}\\left(\\frac{a}{2}, -\\frac{b}{2}\\right) = p_0 \\left( 1 + c_1 \\frac{a/2}{a} + c_2 \\frac{-b/2}{b} \\right) $$\n$$ \\sigma_{zz}\\left(\\frac{a}{2}, -\\frac{b}{2}\\right) = p_0 \\left( 1 + \\frac{c_1}{2} - \\frac{c_2}{2} \\right) $$\nThis is the final expression for the stress at the requested point and location.

It is a well-posed boundary value problem, a classic topic in continuum mechanics often used to illustrate Saint-Venant's principle. The problem statement is objective, self-contained, and mathematically formalizable. It is free of scientific inaccuracies, contradictions, or ambiguities.\n\nStep 3: Verdict\nThe problem is valid. A solution will be provided.\n\nThe solution proceeds by addressing the three tasks in order.\n\nTask 1: Argument from First Principles\nThe governing equations of linear elasticity are linear. Therefore, the principle of superposition is applicable. We consider a \"difference\" problem for the displacement field $\\Delta\\mathbf{u} = \\mathbf{u}^{(B)} - \\mathbf{u}^{(A)}$ and its associated strain and stress fields, $\\Delta\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}$ and $\\Delta\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}$. This difference problem is itself a valid problem of linear elasticity.\n\nThe boundary conditions for this difference problem are as follows:\n- On the lateral surface $r=a$ for $z>0$, both original problems specify traction-free conditions. Thus, the traction for the difference problem is also zero: $\\Delta\\mathbf{t}|_{r=a} = \\mathbf{t}^{(B)}|_{r=a} - \\mathbf{t}^{(A)}|_{r=a} = \\mathbf{0} - \\mathbf{0} = \\mathbf{0}$.\n- On the end face $z=0$, the traction for the difference problem is $\\Delta\\mathbf{t}|_{z=0} = \\mathbf{t}^{(B)} - \\mathbf{t}^{(A)}$. Since both original tractions are purely tangential ($t_{\\theta}$), the difference traction is also purely tangential, given by $\\Delta t_{\\theta}(r) = t_{\\theta}^{(B)}(r) - t_{\\theta}^{(A)}(r)$. All other components of traction, $\\Delta t_r$ and $\\Delta t_z$, are zero.\n\nWe must examine the static resultant of the traction $\\Delta t_{\\theta}(r)$ applied at $z=0$. The resultant torque about the $z$-axis is given by:\n$$ \\Delta T = \\int_{0}^{2\\pi} \\int_{0}^{a} r (\\Delta t_{\\theta}(r)) r \\, dr \\, d\\theta = \\int_{0}^{a} 2\\pi r^2 (t_{\\theta}^{(B)}(r) - t_{\\theta}^{(A)}(r)) \\, dr $$\n$$ \\Delta T = \\int_{0}^{a} 2\\pi r^2 t_{\\theta}^{(B)}(r) \\, dr - \\int_{0}^{a} 2\\pi r^2 t_{\\theta}^{(A)}(r) \\, dr = T - T = 0 $$\nThe resultant forces in all directions are also zero because the applied tractions are purely circumferential. Thus, the system of tractions applied to the end face $z=0$ in the difference problem is statically self-equilibrated; its resultant force and resultant moment are both zero.\n\nAccording to Saint-Venant's principle, the stresses and strains due to a self-equilibrated system of loads decay with distance from the region of load application. In this case, the self-equilibrated load is applied at $z=0$. Therefore, the stress field $\\Delta\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}$ must be significant only in a region near the end face $z=0$ and must decay to negligible values as $z$ increases. This confirms the statement in the first task. The uniqueness theorem ensures that this decaying stress field is the only possible solution for the difference problem under the condition that stresses vanish at $z \\to \\infty$.\n\nTask 2: Derivation for Axisymmetric Torsion\nFor a state of axisymmetric torsion, the displacement field has only one non-zero component, $u_{\\theta}$, which depends only on $r$ and $z$: $\\mathbf{u} = u_{\\theta}(r,z)\\mathbf{e}_{\\theta}$. The strain-displacement relations in cylindrical coordinates yield two non-zero strain components:\n$$ \\epsilon_{r\\theta} = \\frac{1}{2} \\left( \\frac{\\partial u_{\\theta}}{\\partial r} - \\frac{u_{\\theta}}{r} \\right), \\quad \\epsilon_{\\theta z} = \\frac{1}{2}\\frac{\\partial u_{\\theta}}{\\partial z} $$\nFor an isotropic, linearly elastic material, the corresponding shear stresses are:\n$$ \\sigma_{r\\theta} = 2G\\epsilon_{r\\theta} = G \\left( \\frac{\\partial u_{\\theta}}{\\partial r} - \\frac{u_{\\theta}}{r} \\right), \\quad \\sigma_{\\theta z} = 2G\\epsilon_{\\theta z} = G\\frac{\\partial u_{\\theta}}{\\partial z} $$\nwhere $G$ is the shear modulus. All other stress components are zero.\nIn the absence of body forces, the equations of equilibrium $\\nabla \\cdot \\boldsymbol{\\sigma} = \\mathbf{0}$ reduce to a single non-trivial equation (the $\\theta$-component):\n$$ \\frac{\\partial \\sigma_{r\\theta}}{\\partial r} + \\frac{\\partial \\sigma_{\\theta z}}{\\partial z} + \\frac{2\\sigma_{r\\theta}}{r} = 0 $$\nSubstituting the stress-displacement relations into the equilibrium equation gives:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial r} \\left[ G \\left( \\frac{\\partial u_{\\theta}}{\\partial r} - \\frac{u_{\\theta}}{r} \\right) \\right] + \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z} \\left[ G \\frac{\\partial u_{\\theta}}{\\partial z} \\right] + \\frac{2}{r} \\left[ G \\left( \\frac{\\partial u_{\\theta}}{\\partial r} - \\frac{u_{\\theta}}{r} \\right) \\right] = 0 $$\nAssuming the shear modulus $G$ is constant, we divide by it and simplify the expression:\n$$ \\left( \\frac{\\partial^2 u_{\\theta}}{\\partial r^2} - \\frac{1}{r}\\frac{\\partial u_{\\theta}}{\\partial r} + \\frac{u_{\\theta}}{r^2} \\right) + \\frac{\\partial^2 u_{\\theta}}{\\partial z^2} + \\left( \\frac{2}{r}\\frac{\\partial u_{\\theta}}{\\partial r} - \\frac{2u_{\\theta}}{r^2} \\right) = 0 $$\n$$ \\frac{\\partial^2 u_{\\theta}}{\\partial r^2} + \\frac{1}{r}\\frac{\\partial u_{\\theta}}{\\partial r} - \\frac{u_{\\theta}}{r^2} + \\frac{\\partial^2 u_{\\theta}}{\\partial z^2} = 0 $$\nThis is the governing partial differential equation for $u_{\\theta}(r,z)$. We seek a separable solution for the disturbance field of the form $u_{\\theta}(r,z) = R(r)\\,\\exp(-kz)$, where $k>0$ ensures decay as $z \\to \\infty$. Substituting this into the PDE yields:\n$$ \\left( R''(r) + \\frac{1}{r}R'(r) - \\frac{R(r)}{r^2} \\right)\\exp(-kz) + R(r) (k^2)\\exp(-kz) = 0 $$\nDividing by $\\exp(-kz)$ gives an ordinary differential equation for $R(r)$:\n$$ R''(r) + \\frac{1}{r}R'(r) + \\left(k^2 - \\frac{1}{r^2}\\right) R(r) = 0 $$\nMultiplying by $r^2$ gives $r^2 R''(r) + r R'(r) + (k^2 r^2 - 1) R(r) = 0$. By letting $x=kr$, this transforms to $x^2 R'' + x R' + (x^2-1)R=0$, which is Bessel's equation of order $\\nu=1$.\nThe general solution for $R(r)$ is $R(r) = C_1 J_1(kr) + C_2 Y_1(kr)$, where $J_1$ and $Y_1$ are Bessel functions of the first and second kind of order $1$.\nThe displacement must be finite at the axis of the cylinder, $r=0$. Since $Y_1(kr) \\to -\\infty$ as $r \\to 0$, physical regularity requires $C_2=0$. Thus, $R(r) = C_1 J_1(kr)$.\nThe lateral surface at $r=a$ is traction-free, which requires $\\sigma_{r\\theta}|_{r=a}=0$. The stress component $\\sigma_{r\\theta}$ is:\n$$ \\sigma_{r\\theta}(r,z) = G \\left( \\frac{\\partial u_{\\theta}}{\\partial r} - \\frac{u_{\\theta}}{r} \\right) = G C_1 \\exp(-kz) \\left( k J_1'(kr) - \\frac{J_1(kr)}{r} \\right) $$\nApplying the boundary condition at $r=a$:\n$$ k J_1'(ka) - \\frac{J_1(ka)}{a} = 0 $$\nWe use the Bessel function identity $x J'_{\\nu}(x) = \\nu J_{\\nu}(x) - x J_{\\nu+1}(x)$. For $\\nu=1$, this is $x J'_1(x) = J_1(x) - x J_2(x)$. Applying this with $x=ka$:\n$$ ka J_1'(ka) = J_1(ka) - ka J_2(ka) \\implies J_1'(ka) = \\frac{J_1(ka)}{ka} - J_2(ka) $$\nSubstituting this into the boundary condition:\n$$ k \\left( \\frac{J_1(ka)}{ka} - J_2(ka) \\right) - \\frac{J_1(ka)}{a} = 0 $$\n$$ \\frac{J_1(ka)}{a} - k J_2(ka) - \\frac{J_1(ka)}{a} = 0 $$\n$$ -k J_2(ka) = 0 $$\nSince we seek a decaying solution ($k \\neq 0$), the eigenvalue condition for the admissible decay rates $k_n$ is $J_2(k_n a) = 0$.\n\nTask 3: Characteristic Decay Length\nThe admissible values for $k a$ are the positive roots of the Bessel function of the second order, $J_2(x)=0$. Let these roots be denoted by $\\lambda_n$, where $n=1, 2, 3, \\ldots$. Thus, $k_n a = \\lambda_n$, which implies $k_n = \\lambda_n / a$.\nThe smallest positive eigenvalue, $k_1$, corresponds to the first positive root, $\\lambda_1$, of $J_2(x)$.\n$$ k_1 = \\frac{\\lambda_1}{a} $$\nFrom standard tables of mathematical functions, the first positive root of $J_2(x)$ is $\\lambda_1 \\approx 5.1356223$.\nThe characteristic decay length $\\ell$ is defined as the reciprocal of the smallest positive decay rate $k_1$:\n$$ \\ell = \\frac{1}{k_1} = \\frac{a}{\\lambda_1} $$\nThe problem asks for the ratio $c = \\ell/a$.\n$$ c = \\frac{\\ell}{a} = \\frac{1}{\\lambda_1} $$\nUsing the value of $\\lambda_1$:\n$$ c = \\frac{1}{5.1356223\\ldots} \\approx 0.194721\\ldots $$\nRounding to four significant figures, we get $c = 0.1947$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{0.1947}\n$$", "id": "2928625"}, {"introduction": "A deep understanding of any scientific principle includes knowing its limitations.

Then, using your expression, explain from first principles why Saint-Venant-type decay holds for sufficiently high transverse modes away from resonance, and why it may fail in the two limiting cases:\n- as $\\omega\\to 0$ for the $n=0$ mode (long-wavelength across the strip), and\n- as $\\omega$ approaches the cutoff from below for any fixed $n\\ge 1$ (near-resonant or near-cutoff behavior).\n\nAnswer requirement: Provide a single closed-form analytic expression for $\\alpha_n(\\omega)$ in terms of $n$, $W$, $\\omega$, and $c_T$ for the evanescent regime. No rounding is required. Do not include units in your final answer.", "solution": "The problem presented is a well-posed boundary value problem in linear elastodynamics and is scientifically sound. We shall proceed with its solution.\n\nThe governing equation for anti-plane shear displacement $w(x,y,t)$ is given as:\n$$\n\\rho \\,\\frac{\\partial^2 w}{\\partial t^2} = \\mu\\left(\\frac{\\partial^2 w}{\\partial x^2} + \\frac{\\partial^2 w}{\\partial y^2}\\right)\n$$\nThis can be rewritten using the shear wave speed $c_T = \\sqrt{\\mu/\\rho}$ as:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{c_T^2}\\,\\frac{\\partial^2 w}{\\partial t^2} = \\frac{\\partial^2 w}{\\partial x^2} + \\frac{\\partial^2 w}{\\partial y^2}\n$$\nThe loading is time-harmonic with circular frequency $\\omega$. This suggests a steady-state solution of the form $w(x,y,t) = W(x,y)\\cos(\\omega t)$. Substituting this ansatz into the governing equation yields:\n$$\n-\\frac{\\omega^2}{c_T^2} W(x,y)\\cos(\\omega t) = \\left(\\frac{\\partial^2 W}{\\partial x^2} + \\frac{\\partial^2 W}{\\partial y^2}\\right)\\cos(\\omega t)\n$$\nFor this to hold for all time $t$, the spatial amplitude $W(x,y)$ must satisfy the Helmholtz equation:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial^2 W}{\\partial x^2} + \\frac{\\partial^2 W}{\\partial y^2} + k^2 W = 0\n$$\nwhere $k = \\omega/c_T$ is the free-space wavenumber.\n\nWe solve this partial differential equation using the method of separation of variables. Let $W(x,y) = X(x)Y(y)$. Substituting this into the Helmholtz equation gives:\n$$\nX''(x)Y(y) + X(x)Y''(y) + k^2 X(x)Y(y) = 0\n$$\nDividing by $X(x)Y(y)$ separates the variables:\n$$\n\\frac{X''(x)}{X(x)} + \\frac{Y''(y)}{Y(y)} + k^2 = 0 \\implies \\frac{Y''(y)}{Y(y)} = - \\frac{X''(x)}{X(x)} - k^2\n$$\nSince the left side depends only on $y$ and the right side depends only on $x$, both sides must equal a separation constant, which we denote as $-\\beta^2$. This yields two ordinary differential equations:\n$$\nY''(y) + \\beta^2 Y(y) = 0\n$$\n$$\nX''(x) + (k^2 - \\beta^2)X(x) = 0\n$$\nThe traction-free boundary conditions at the edges $y=0$ and $y=W$ are $\\tau_{zy}(x,0,t)=0$ and $\\tau_{zy}(x,W,t)=0$. Since $\\tau_{zy} = \\mu\\,\\frac{\\partial w}{\\partial y}$, these conditions imply $\\frac{\\partial w}{\\partial y}(x,0,t) = 0$ and $\\frac{\\partial w}{\\partial y}(x,W,t) = 0$. For our separated solution, this translates to $Y'(0)=0$ and $Y'(W)=0$.\n\nThe general solution to the equation for $Y(y)$ is $Y(y) = A \\cos(\\beta y) + B \\sin(\\beta y)$. Applying the first boundary condition, $Y'(0) = -A\\beta\\sin(0) + B\\beta\\cos(0) = B\\beta = 0$. For a non-trivial solution, we must allow for $\\beta=0$; if $\\beta \\neq 0$, then $B=0$.\nIf $B=0$, the solution is $Y(y) = A\\cos(\\beta y)$. The second boundary condition is $Y'(W) = -A\\beta\\sin(\\beta W) = 0$. For a non-trivial solution ($A \\neq 0$), we must have $\\sin(\\beta W) = 0$, provided $\\beta \\neq 0$. This gives the discrete eigenvalues $\\beta W = n\\pi$ for $n \\in \\mathbb{N}$.\nIf $\\beta=0$, the equation is $Y''(y)=0$, with general solution $Y(y)=Cy+D$. The boundary conditions $Y'(0)=C=0$ and $Y'(W)=C=0$ are satisfied. Thus, $Y(y)=D$ (a constant) is also a valid solution.\nCombining these cases, the eigenvalues are $\\beta_n = \\frac{n\\pi}{W}$ for $n \\in \\mathbb{N}\\cup\\{0\\}$, and the corresponding eigenfunctions, which represent the transverse modal forms, are $Y_n(y) = A_n \\cos(\\frac{n\\pi y}{W})$. The linearity of the problem allows for the general solution to be a superposition of these modes. The given loading at $x=0$ has the form $\\cos(\\frac{n\\pi y}{W})$, which by uniqueness excites only the $n$-th mode.\n\nNow we analyze the equation for $X(x)$ for the $n$-th mode:\n$$\nX_n''(x) - (\\beta_n^2 - k^2)X_n(x) = 0\n$$\nThe behavior of the solution depends on the sign of $\\beta_n^2 - k^2$.\nThe mode is propagating if $\\beta_n^2 - k^2 < 0$, or $\\omega > \\omega_n \\equiv \\frac{n\\pi c_T}{W}$, where $\\omega_n$ is the cut-off frequency of the $n$-th mode.\nThe mode is evanescent if $\\beta_n^2 - k^2 > 0$, or $\\omega < \\omega_n$. This is the regime of interest. In this case, we define a real, non-negative attenuation constant $\\alpha_n$ such that $\\alpha_n^2 = \\beta_n^2 - k^2$. The equation for $X_n(x)$ becomes:\n$$\nX_n''(x) - \\alpha_n^2 X_n(x) = 0\n$$\nThe general solution is $X_n(x) = C e^{\\alpha_n x} + D e^{-\\alpha_n x}$. The problem requires a bounded solution as $x \\to +\\infty$. The term $e^{\\alpha_n x}$ grows without bound, so its coefficient $C$ must be zero. This leaves $X_n(x) = D e^{-\\alpha_n x}$, which describes exponential decay away from the loaded end $x=0$.\nThe attenuation constant $\\alpha_n(\\omega)$ is derived from its definition:\n$$\n\\alpha_n^2 = \\beta_n^2 - k^2 = \\left(\\frac{n\\pi}{W}\\right)^2 - \\left(\\frac{\\omega}{c_T}\\right)^2\n$$\nTaking the positive square root gives the expression for the attenuation constant in the evanescent regime ($\\omega < \\omega_n$):\n$$\n\\alpha_n(\\omega) = \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{n\\pi}{W}\\right)^2 - \\left(\\frac{\\omega}{c_T}\\right)^2}\n$$\n\nThis result allows us to analyze Saint-Venant's principle. In waveguide structures, this principle implies that stresses and strains resulting from a self-equilibrated load decay exponentially with distance from the load. A general load can be decomposed into modes. Propagating modes ($\\omega > \\omega_n$) do not decay, while evanescent modes ($\\omega < \\omega_n$) do. Saint-Venant decay is associated with these evanescent modes.\nFor sufficiently high transverse modes (large $n$), for a fixed frequency $\\omega$, the condition $\\omega < \\omega_n$ is always met. The attenuation constant becomes:\n$$\n\\alpha_n(\\omega) \\approx \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{n\\pi}{W}\\right)^2} = \\frac{n\\pi}{W} \\quad \\text{as } n \\to \\infty\n$$\nSince $\\alpha_n$ grows linearly with $n$, the decay of higher modes, $e^{-\\alpha_n x}$, is extremely rapid. These modes correspond to the fine-scale spatial variations of the load. Far from the source, only the non-decaying propagating modes and the slowest-decaying evanescent modes persist. The rapid decay of higher-order modal components is the mathematical statement of Saint-Venant's principle in this context.\n\nHowever, the principle fails in certain limits:\n1. As $\\omega \\to 0$ for the $n=0$ mode: For $n=0$, the cutoff frequency is $\\omega_0 = 0$. For any $\\omega > 0$, this mode is propagating, not evanescent. The wave number is $k_0 = \\sqrt{k^2 - \\beta_0^2} = k = \\omega/c_T$. The solution propagates without any spatial attenuation. Therefore, there is no spatial decay. The load corresponding to the $n=0$ mode, being uniform across the width, represents a net force and is not self-equilibrated. Saint-Venant's principle is not expected to hold for non-self-equilibrated loads. As $\\omega \\to 0$, $k_0 \\to 0$, and the solution approaches a static linear displacement profile $w(x) \\propto x$, which is unbounded and shows no decay.\n2. As $\\omega \\to \\omega_n^-$ for $n \\ge 1$: In this limit, the frequency approaches the cutoff frequency of the $n$-th mode from below. The mode is still evanescent, but the attenuation constant approaches zero:\n$$\n\\lim_{\\omega \\to \\omega_n^-} \\alpha_n(\\omega) = \\lim_{\\omega \\to (n\\pi c_T/W)^-} \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{n\\pi}{W}\\right)^2 - \\left(\\frac{\\omega}{c_T}\\right)^2} = 0\n$$\nAn attenuation constant of zero implies no decay. The characteristic decay length, $L_d = 1/\\alpha_n$, tends to infinity. The disturbance associated with this mode penetrates arbitrarily far into the waveguide. This \"near-cutoff\" behavior represents a failure of the principle of rapid decay.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{n\\pi}{W}\\right)^{2} - \\left(\\frac{\\omega}{c_T}\\right)^{2}}}$$", "id": "2928670"}]}
