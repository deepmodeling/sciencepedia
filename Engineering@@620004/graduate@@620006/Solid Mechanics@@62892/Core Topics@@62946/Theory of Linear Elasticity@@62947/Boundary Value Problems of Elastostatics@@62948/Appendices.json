{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "Our journey into the hands-on practices of elastostatics begins with the most fundamental concept: the relationship between an object's displacement and its internal deformation, or strain. This exercise challenges you to take a given displacement field and use it to compute the components of the infinitesimal strain tensor. Mastering this kinematic description is the essential first step in analyzing how any solid body responds to loads and deforms, providing the foundation for all subsequent stress analysis. [@problem_id:2620349]", "problem": "Consider a linearly elastic, homogeneous, and simply connected solid body undergoing small deformations so that the linearized kinematics are valid. The displacement field is prescribed as $u_{x}(x,y,z)=a\\,x$, $u_{y}(x,y,z)=b\\,y$, $u_{z}(x,y,z)=c\\,z$, where $a$, $b$, and $c$ are constant real parameters with $|a|,|b|,|c| \\ll 1$. Starting from the fundamental definitions of the displacement gradient, the infinitesimal strain tensor, and the infinitesimal rotation tensor, do the following: compute all components of the infinitesimal strain tensor, compute the volumetric strain (defined as the trace of the infinitesimal strain tensor), compute the infinitesimal rotation tensor to assess whether the deformation is irrotational, and classify the deformation in terms of its volumetric and distortional character by stating algebraic conditions on $a$, $b$, and $c$ under which it is a pure dilatation, an isochoric distortion, or a general triaxial stretch. Use only balance and kinematic principles appropriate to small-strain elastostatics; do not invoke any finite-deformation measures. For grading purposes, report only the volumetric strain as your final answer, expressed symbolically and dimensionlessly. No rounding is required, and there are no physical units to report.", "solution": "The problem presented is valid and represents a fundamental exercise in the kinematics of continuum mechanics. It is well-posed, scientifically sound, and contains sufficient information for a unique solution. We shall proceed with a rigorous derivation.\n\nThe displacement field is provided in Cartesian coordinates $(x, y, z)$ as $\\mathbf{u}(x,y,z)$. Its components are given by:\n$u_x(x,y,z) = a\\,x$\n$u_y(x,y,z) = b\\,y$\n$u_z(x,y,z) = c\\,z$\nwhere $a$, $b$, and $c$ are small, real constants, satisfying $|a|, |b|, |c| \\ll 1$. This condition justifies the use of linearized, or infinitesimal, strain theory.\n\nFirst, we compute the displacement gradient tensor, $\\mathbf{H}$, whose components $H_{ij}$ are defined as the partial derivatives of the displacement components with respect to the spatial coordinates, $H_{ij} = \\frac{\\partial u_i}{\\partial x_j}$. Let $x_1=x$, $x_2=y$, $x_3=z$.\n\nThe components of $\\mathbf{H}$ are:\n$H_{11} = \\frac{\\partial u_x}{\\partial x} = \\frac{\\partial(a\\,x)}{\\partial x} = a$\n$H_{22} = \\frac{\\partial u_y}{\\partial y} = \\frac{\\partial(b\\,y)}{\\partial y} = b$\n$H_{33} = \\frac{\\partial u_z}{\\partial z} = \\frac{\\partial(c\\,z)}{\\partial z} = c$\n\nAll off-diagonal components are zero, for example:\n$H_{12} = \\frac{\\partial u_x}{\\partial y} = \\frac{\\partial(a\\,x)}{\\partial y} = 0$\n$H_{21} = \\frac{\\partial u_y}{\\partial x} = \\frac{\\partial(b\\,y)}{\\partial x} = 0$\nThis holds for all $i \\neq j$. Thus, the displacement gradient tensor is a diagonal matrix:\n$$\n\\mathbf{H} = \\begin{pmatrix} a & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & b & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & c \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe displacement gradient tensor $\\mathbf{H}$ can be decomposed into a symmetric part, the infinitesimal strain tensor $\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}$, and a skew-symmetric part, the infinitesimal rotation tensor $\\boldsymbol{\\omega}$. This is the fundamental Helmholtz decomposition of a second-order tensor: $\\mathbf{H} = \\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon} + \\boldsymbol{\\omega}$.\n\nThe infinitesimal strain tensor $\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}$ is defined as $\\varepsilon_{ij} = \\frac{1}{2} (H_{ij} + H_{ji})$. Since our calculated $\\mathbf{H}$ is already a symmetric matrix ($H_{ij} = H_{ji}$), its skew-symmetric part is zero and its symmetric part is itself.\nTherefore, the infinitesimal strain tensor is identical to the displacement gradient tensor:\n$$\n\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon} = \\mathbf{H} = \\begin{pmatrix} a & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & b & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & c \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe components of the strain tensor are:\n$\\varepsilon_{xx} = a$, $\\varepsilon_{yy} = b$, $\\varepsilon_{zz} = c$.\nThe shear strain components are all zero: $\\varepsilon_{xy} = \\varepsilon_{yz} = \\varepsilon_{zx} = 0$.\n\nNext, we compute the volumetric strain, $\\varepsilon_V$, which is defined as the trace of the infinitesimal strain tensor, $\\varepsilon_V = \\text{tr}(\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon})$.\n$$\n\\varepsilon_V = \\varepsilon_{xx} + \\varepsilon_{yy} + \\varepsilon_{zz}\n$$\nSubstituting the components we have found:\n$$\n\\varepsilon_V = a + b + c\n$$\nThis quantity represents the infinitesimal change in volume per unit original volume.\n\nThe infinitesimal rotation tensor $\\boldsymbol{\\omega}$ is defined as $\\omega_{ij} = \\frac{1}{2} (H_{ij} - H_{ji})$. Since $\\mathbf{H}$ is symmetric, all components of $\\boldsymbol{\\omega}$ are identically zero.\n$$\n\\boldsymbol{\\omega} = \\frac{1}{2} (\\mathbf{H} - \\mathbf{H}^T) = \\frac{1}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} a-a & 0-0 & 0-0 \\\\ 0-0 & b-b & 0-0 \\\\ 0-0 & 0-0 & c-c \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nA zero rotation tensor signifies that the deformation is irrotational. Such a deformation is also called a pure strain or pure stretch.\n\nFinally, we classify the deformation. The strain tensor $\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}$ can be decomposed into a spherical part (related to volume change) and a deviatoric part (related to shape change or distortion).\n$\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon} = \\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}_{\\text{spherical}} + \\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}_{\\text{deviatoric}}$\nThe spherical part is given by $\\frac{1}{3}\\text{tr}(\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon})\\mathbf{I} = \\frac{1}{3}(a+b+c)\\mathbf{I}$.\nThe deviatoric part is $\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}' = \\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon} - \\frac{1}{3}\\text{tr}(\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon})\\mathbf{I}$.\n$$\n\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}' = \\frac{1}{3} \\begin{pmatrix} 2a-b-c & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 2b-a-c & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 2c-a-b \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe deformation is classified as follows:\n$1$. **Pure Dilatation**: A purely volumetric change with no distortion. This occurs when the deviatoric strain tensor is zero, $\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}' = \\mathbf{0}$. This requires that all diagonal elements of $\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}'$ are zero, which leads to the condition $a=b=c$. In this case, there is uniform expansion or contraction in all directions.\n\n$2$. **Isochoric Distortion**: A purely distortional change of shape with no change in volume. \"Isochoric\" means volume-preserving. This occurs when the volumetric strain is zero, $\\varepsilon_V = 0$. The algebraic condition is therefore $a+b+c=0$.\n\n$3$. **General Triaxial Stretch**: This is the most general case for this deformation field, where there is both a change in volume and a change in shape. This occurs when neither of the above two special conditions is met, i.e., when $(a,b,c)$ are not all equal AND $a+b+c \\neq 0$.\n\nThe problem requires a single final answer, which is the symbolic expression for the volumetric strain.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{a+b+c}$$", "id": "2620349"}, {"introduction": "Once we can describe deformation kinematically through strain, the next logical step is to determine the internal forces, or stresses, that arise.
