It is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. All necessary information is provided, and the assumptions are standard for the derivation of the Euler buckling load. The problem is valid. We shall proceed with the solution by following the specified sequence of tasks.\n\na) Formulation of the total potential energy functional $\\Pi[w]$.\n\nThe total potential energy $\\Pi$ is the sum of the internal strain energy, $U$, and the potential energy of the external loads, $\\Omega$. Thus, $\\Pi = U + \\Omega$.\n\nThe strain energy $U$ for an Euler-Bernoulli beam is stored due to bending. It is given by the integral of the bending strain energy density over the length of the strut.\n$$\nU = \\frac{1}{2} \\int_{0}^{L} M(x) \\kappa(x) \\, \\mathrm{d}x\n$$\nwhere $M(x)$ is the internal bending moment and $\\kappa(x)$ is the curvature of the deflected centerline. For a linearly elastic material, the moment is related to the curvature by the constitutive law $M(x) = EI \\kappa(x)$, where $EI$ is the constant bending stiffness.\nUnder the small deflection assumption, the curvature can be approximated as $\\kappa(x) \\approx \\frac{d^2w}{dx^2} = w''(x)$. Substituting these relations gives the strain energy functional:\n$$\nU[w] = \\frac{1}{2} \\int_{0}^{L} EI (w''(x))^2 \\, \\mathrm{d}x\n$$\nThe potential energy of the external compressive load $P$ is $\\Omega = -W$, where $W$ is the work done by the load. The work done is the product of the force $P$ and the axial displacement it acts through, which is the end-shortening $\\Delta$.\n$$\nW = P \\Delta\n$$\nThe end-shortening $\\Delta$ arises because the curved deflected path between $x=0$ and $x=L$ must have the same arc length $L$ as the initially straight strut (neglecting axial stretch), but its projection onto the $x$-axis is shorter. The arc length $ds$ of an infinitesimal segment $dx$ is $ds = \\sqrt{dx^2 + dw^2} = \\sqrt{1 + (w'(x))^2} \\mathrm{d}x$. The total arc length is $S = \\int_0^L \\sqrt{1 + (w'(x))^2} \\, \\mathrm{d}x$. The problem specifies to neglect axial stretching, meaning $S=L$. The shortening $\\Delta$ is the difference between this arc length and the projected chord length, $L$.\n$$\n\\Delta = S - L = \\int_0^L \\left(\\sqrt{1 + (w'(x))^2} - 1\\right) \\mathrm{d}x\n$$\nFor small slopes, $|w'(x)| \\ll 1$, we can use the Taylor expansion $\\sqrt{1+u} \\approx 1 + \\frac{1}{2}u$ for small $u$. Setting $u = (w'(x))^2$, we obtain the end-shortening to quadratic order in $w'(x)$:\n$$\n\\Delta \\approx \\int_0^L \\left( \\left(1 + \\frac{1}{2}(w'(x))^2 \\right) - 1 \\right) \\mathrm{d}x = \\frac{1}{2} \\int_0^L (w'(x))^2 \\, \\mathrm{d}x\n$$\nThe potential of the load $P$ is therefore:\n$$\n\\Omega[w] = -P \\Delta = -\\frac{1}{2} P \\int_0^L (w'(x))^2 \\, \\mathrm{d}x\n$$\nCombining the strain energy and the load potential, the total potential energy functional $\\Pi[w]$ is:\n$$\n\\Pi[w] = U[w] + \\Omega[w] = \\frac{1}{2} \\int_{0}^{L} EI (w''(x))^2 \\, \\mathrm{d}x - \\frac{1}{2} P \\int_{0}^{L} (w'(x))^2 \\, \\mathrm{d}x\n$$\nThis can be written compactly as:\n$$\n\\Pi[w] = \\frac{1}{2} \\int_{0}^{L} \\left[ EI (w''(x))^2 - P (w'(x))^2 \\right] \\mathrm{d}x\n$$\n\nb) Derivation of the Euler–Lagrange equation and natural boundary conditions.\n\nFor equilibrium, the total potential energy must be stationary, which means its first variation must vanish for all kinematically admissible variations. Let $w(x)$ be an equilibrium configuration and $v(x)$ be an arbitrary admissible variation. An admissible variation must satisfy the essential (or geometric) boundary conditions of the problem. For a simply supported strut, the deflection must be zero at the ends: $w(0)=0$ and $w(L)=0$. Thus, $v(x)$ must satisfy $v(0)=0$ and $v(L)=0$.\n\nThe first variation, $\\delta \\Pi$, is computed as:\n$$\n\\delta \\Pi = \\frac{d}{d\\epsilon} \\Pi[w+\\epsilon v] \\bigg|_{\\epsilon=0} = \\int_{0}^{L} \\left[ EI w'' v'' - P w' v' \\right] \\mathrm{d}x = 0\n$$\nTo obtain the Euler-Lagrange equation, we use integration by parts to factor out the variation $v(x)$.\nWe integrate the first term, $\\int (EI w'')v'' \\mathrm{d}x$, by parts twice:\n$$\n\\int_{0}^{L} (EI w'')v'' \\mathrm{d}x = [EI w'' v']_{0}^{L} - \\int_{0}^{L} (EI w''')v' \\mathrm{d}x = [EI w'' v']_{0}^{L} - [EI w''' v]_{0}^{L} + \\int_{0}^{L} (EI w'''')v \\mathrm{d}x\n$$\nWe integrate the second term, $\\int (-P w')v' \\mathrm{d}x$, by parts once:\n$$\n- \\int_{0}^{L} (P w')v' \\mathrm{d}x = -[P w' v]_{0}^{L} + \\int_{0}^{L} (P w'')v \\mathrm{d}x\n$$\nCombining these results, the first variation becomes:\n$$\n\\delta \\Pi = \\int_{0}^{L} (EI w'''' + P w'') v \\, \\mathrm{d}x + [EI w'' v']_{0}^{L} - [EI w''' v - Pw'v]_{0}^{L} = 0\n$$\nSince the variation $v(x)$ must satisfy the essential boundary conditions, $v(0)=v(L)=0$, the boundary term involving $v$ (but not its derivatives) vanishes: $[EI w''' v - Pw'v]_{0}^{L} = 0$.\nThe stationarity condition simplifies to:\n$$\n\\int_{0}^{L} (EI w'''' + P w'') v \\, \\mathrm{d}x + [EI w'' v']_{0}^{L} = 0\n$$\nThis equation must hold for all admissible variations $v(x)$. By the fundamental lemma of calculus of variations, the integrand in the first term must be zero, which gives the Euler-Lagrange equation for equilibrium:\n$$\nEI w''''(x) + P w''(x) = 0\n$$\nThe remaining boundary term must also vanish for any admissible variation:\n$$\n[EI w'' v']_{0}^{L} = (EI w''(L))v'(L) - (EI w''(0))v'(0) = 0\n$$\nSince the slope, and thus $v'(x)$, is not constrained at the pinned supports, $v'(0)$ and $v'(L)$ can be arbitrary. Therefore, their coefficients must be zero. This yields the natural boundary conditions:\n$$\nw''(0) = 0 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad w''(L) = 0\n$$\nPhysically, this corresponds to a zero bending moment ($M=EIw''$) at the supports. The essential boundary conditions are $w(0)=0$ and $w(L)=0$.\n\nc) Analysis of the trivial solution and the second variation.\n\nFirst, we verify that the straight configuration, $w(x) \\equiv 0$, is an equilibrium solution. Substituting $w(x)=0$ into the Euler-Lagrange equation gives $EI(0) + P(0) = 0$, which is satisfied. The boundary conditions $w(0)=0$, $w(L)=0$, $w''(0)=0$, and $w''(L)=0$ are also all satisfied. Hence, $w(x) \\equiv 0$ is an equilibrium solution for any load $P$.\n\nTo analyze the stability of this trivial equilibrium, we examine the second variation of the potential energy, $\\delta^2 \\Pi$. The equilibrium is stable if $\\Pi$ is a local minimum, which requires $\\delta^2 \\Pi > 0$ for all non-zero admissible variations $v(x)$. The second variation is computed by taking the second derivative of $\\Pi[w+\\epsilon v]$ with respect to $\\epsilon$ and evaluating at $\\epsilon=0$ about the equilibrium state $w \\equiv 0$.\n$$\n\\delta^2 \\Pi[w;v] = \\frac{d^2}{d\\epsilon^2} \\Pi[w+\\epsilon v]\\bigg|_{\\epsilon=0} = \\int_0^L \\left[ EI (v'')^2 - P (v')^2 \\right] \\mathrm{d}x\n$$\nNote that for this problem, $\\delta^2 \\Pi$ is independent of the equilibrium configuration $w(x)$.\nFor the trivial solution $w \\equiv 0$ to be stable, and thus the unique solution under the given conservative loading, we must have $\\delta^2 \\Pi[0;v] > 0$ for all $v(x) \\not\\equiv 0$ satisfying $v(0)=v(L)=0$.\nThe condition is:\n$$\n\\int_0^L EI (v'')^2 \\mathrm{d}x - P \\int_0^L (v')^2 \\mathrm{d}x > 0\n$$\nThis can be rearranged to state a condition on the load $P$:\n$$\nP  \\frac{\\int_0^L EI (v'')^2 \\mathrm{d}x}{\\int_0^L (v')^2 \\mathrm{d}x}\n$$\nThis inequality must hold for all admissible functions $v(x)$. The stability of the trivial solution is guaranteed as long as $P$ is less than the minimum possible value of this Rayleigh quotient. The loss of uniqueness occurs precisely when this inequality can be violated, i.e., at the load $P$ for which the minimum value of the quotient is achieved, leading to $\\delta^2 \\Pi = 0$ for the corresponding minimizing function $v(x)$ (the buckling mode). This critical load marks the bifurcation point where non-trivial solutions become possible.\n\nd) Determination of the smallest critical load.\n\nThe critical load $P_{cr}$ is the smallest value of $P$ for which a non-trivial solution to the equilibrium problem exists. This corresponds to the threshold where $\\delta^2\\Pi$ ceases to be positive definite. The governing equation for the buckled shape is the same as the Euler-Lagrange equation derived in part (b):\n$$\nEI w''''(x) + P w''(x) = 0\n$$\nsubject to the boundary conditions $w(0)=w(L)=0$ and $w''(0)=w''(L)=0$.\nLet $k^2 = P/(EI)$, assuming $P>0$. The differential equation becomes:\n$$\nw'''' + k^2 w'' = 0\n$$\nThe characteristic equation is $r^4 + k^2 r^2 = 0$, or $r^2(r^2 + k^2) = 0$. The roots are $r_1=r_2=0$ and $r_3, r_4 = \\pm ik$.\nThe general solution is:\n$$\nw(x) = C_1 \\sin(kx) + C_2 \\cos(kx) + C_3 x + C_4\n$$\nWe apply the four boundary conditions:\n1. $w(0) = 0 \\implies C_2 + C_4 = 0$\n2. $w''(0) = 0 \\implies -k^2 C_2 = 0$. Since we seek a non-trivial solution, $P \\ne 0 \\implies k \\ne 0$, so we must have $C_2=0$.\nFrom $C_2+C_4=0$, we get $C_4=0$.\nThe solution simplifies to $w(x) = C_1 \\sin(kx) + C_3 x$.\n\nNow apply the remaining boundary conditions at $x=L$:\n3. $w(L) = 0 \\implies C_1 \\sin(kL) + C_3 L = 0$\n4. $w''(L) = 0 \\implies -k^2 C_1 \\sin(kL) = 0$.\n\nFrom condition 4, since $k \\ne 0$, either $C_1=0$ or $\\sin(kL)=0$.\nIf $C_1=0$, then from condition 3, $C_3 L = 0$, which implies $C_3=0$. This leads to the trivial solution $w(x) \\equiv 0$.\nTo find a non-trivial solution, we must have $C_1 \\ne 0$, which requires:\n$$\n\\sin(kL) = 0\n$$\nThis is the eigenvalue condition. It is satisfied if $kL = n\\pi$ for any integer $n$.\nIf $\\sin(kL)=0$, condition 3 becomes $C_1(0) + C_3 L = 0$, which implies $C_3 = 0$.\nSo, non-trivial solutions exist when $kL = n\\pi$ for $n=1, 2, 3, \\ldots$ (n=0 corresponds to $k=0$, which is the trivial case). The corresponding solutions (buckling modes) are $w_n(x) = C_1 \\sin(\\frac{n\\pi x}{L})$. The coefficient $C_1$ remains undetermined in this linear analysis.\n\nThe loads at which these non-trivial solutions exist are found by substituting back $k^2 = P/EI$:\n$$\nk^2 L^2 = (n\\pi)^2 \\implies \\frac{P}{EI} L^2 = n^2 \\pi^2\n$$\nSolving for $P$ gives the discrete set of buckling loads:\n$$\nP_n = \\frac{n^2 \\pi^2 EI}{L^2}, \\quad n=1, 2, 3, \\ldots\n$$\nThe problem asks for the smallest load at which non-trivial equilibria bifurcate. This is the lowest of these values, which occurs for $n=1$. This is the critical buckling load, $P_{cr}$.\n$$\nP_{cr} = \\frac{\\pi^2 EI}{L^2}\n$$", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\frac{\\pi^2 EI}{L^2}}\n$$", "id": "2708894"}, {"introduction": "Uniqueness of a solution is a cornerstone of linear elastostatics, a principle you will first re-derive to solidify its foundation.

Applied to our problem, it implies that the integrand $(\\mathbb{C} : \\Delta\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}) : \\Delta\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon} \\ge 0$.

For this deformation:\n$J = \\det(\\lambda\\boldsymbol{I}) = \\lambda^3$.\n$\\boldsymbol{B} = (\\lambda\\boldsymbol{I})(\\lambda\\boldsymbol{I})^{\\mathsf{T}} = \\lambda^2\\boldsymbol{I}$.\nSubstituting these into the stress expression:\n$$\n\\boldsymbol{\\sigma} = \\frac{\\mu}{\\lambda^3}(\\lambda^2\\boldsymbol{I}) + \\left(-\\frac{\\mu}{\\lambda^3} + \\frac{\\kappa \\ln(\\lambda^3)}{\\lambda^3}\\right)\\boldsymbol{I} = \\left(\\frac{\\mu}{\\lambda} - \\frac{\\mu}{\\lambda^3} + \\frac{3\\kappa \\ln \\lambda}{\\lambda^3}\\right)\\boldsymbol{I}\n$$\nThe stress is hydrostatic, $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma} = \\sigma(\\lambda)\\boldsymbol{I}$, where $\\sigma(\\lambda)$ is the scalar stress magnitude.\nFor a homogeneous state, the equilibrium equation $\\nabla \\cdot \\boldsymbol{\\sigma} = \\boldsymbol{0}$ is identically satisfied. Equilibrium must be established via the boundary condition. The traction on the boundary with current normal $\\boldsymbol{n}$ is $\\boldsymbol{t} = \\boldsymbol{\\sigma} \\cdot \\boldsymbol{n} = (\\sigma(\\lambda)\\boldsymbol{I}) \\cdot \\boldsymbol{n} = \\sigma(\\lambda)\\boldsymbol{n}$.\nThe prescribed traction is the follower load $\\boldsymbol{t} = T_0 \\boldsymbol{n}$. Equating the two gives the scalar equilibrium equation:\n$$\n\\sigma(\\lambda) = T_0\n$$\nThis is of the form $s(\\lambda) = T_0$, with the function $s(\\lambda)$ identified as:\n$$\ns(\\lambda) = \\frac{\\mu}{\\lambda} - \\frac{\\mu}{\\lambda^3} + \\frac{3\\kappa \\ln \\lambda}{\\lambda^3}\n$$\nTo analyze the possibility of non-uniqueness, we study the function $s(\\lambda)$ for $\\lambda > 0$. We compute its derivative:\n$$\ns'(\\lambda) = -\\frac{\\mu}{\\lambda^2} + \\frac{3\\mu}{\\lambda^4} - \\frac{9\\kappa \\ln \\lambda}{\\lambda^4} + \\frac{3\\kappa}{\\lambda^4} = \\frac{1}{\\lambda^4} \\left( -\\mu\\lambda^2 + 3\\mu + 3\\kappa - 9\\kappa \\ln \\lambda \\right)\n$$\nExtrema occur when $s'(\\lambda)=0$, which requires the term in parentheses to be zero. Let $g(\\lambda) = -\\mu\\lambda^2 + 3\\mu + 3\\kappa - 9\\kappa \\ln \\lambda$. We need to solve $g(\\lambda)=0$. Let's analyze the behavior of $g(\\lambda)$:\n$$\ng'(\\lambda) = -2\\mu\\lambda - \\frac{9\\kappa}{\\lambda}\n$$\nSince $\\mu > 0$, $\\kappa > 0$, and $\\lambda > 0$, we have $g'(\\lambda)  0$. Thus, $g(\\lambda)$ is a strictly monotonically decreasing function for $\\lambda > 0$.\nLet's check the limits:\n$\\lim_{\\lambda \\to 0^+} g(\\lambda) = \\lim_{\\lambda \\to 0^+} (-9\\kappa \\ln \\lambda) = +\\infty$.\n$\\lim_{\\lambda \\to \\infty} g(\\lambda) = \\lim_{\\lambda \\to \\infty} (-\\mu\\lambda^2) = -\\infty$.\nSince $g(\\lambda)$ is continuous and decreases from $+\\infty$ to $-\\infty$, there exists a unique root $\\lambda_{crit}$ such that $g(\\lambda_{crit})=0$. This corresponds to the unique extremum of $s(\\lambda)$. Since $s'(\\lambda)$ changes from positive (for $\\lambda  \\lambda_{crit}$) to negative (for $\\lambda > \\lambda_{crit}$), this extremum is a global maximum.\nTo show this maximum occurs for $\\lambda > 1$, we evaluate $g(1) = -\\mu + 3\\mu + 3\\kappa - 9\\kappa\\ln(1) = 2\\mu+3\\kappa > 0$. Since $g(1) > 0$ and $g(\\lambda)$ is decreasing, the root $\\lambda_{crit}$ must be greater than $1$.\n\nNow consider the overall shape of $s(\\lambda)$. We have $s(1) = \\mu - \\mu + 0 = 0$. Since $s'(\\lambda)>0$ for $1  \\lambda  \\lambda_{crit}$, the function increases from $s(1)=0$ to a maximum value $s_{max} = s(\\lambda_{crit}) > 0$. For $\\lambda > \\lambda_{crit}$, $s'(\\lambda)  0$ and $\\lim_{\\lambda \\to \\infty} s(\\lambda) = 0$.\nThe function $s(\\lambda)$ rises from $0$ at $\\lambda=1$ to a peak $s_{max}$ at $\\lambda_{crit} > 1$, and then decays back to $0$. Therefore, for any prescribed traction $T_0$ such that $0  T_0  s_{max}$, the equation $s(\\lambda) = T_0$ will have exactly two solutions: one $\\lambda_1 \\in (1, \\lambda_{crit})$ and another $\\lambda_2 \\in (\\lambda_{crit}, \\infty)$. This demonstrates non-uniqueness for the given hydrostatic loading problem.\n\n**Final Calculation**\nWe are given $\\mu = 1\\,\\text{MPa}$, $\\kappa = 10\\,\\text{MPa}$, and $T_{0} = 2.5\\,\\text{MPa}$. The equilibrium equation is:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{\\lambda} - \\frac{1}{\\lambda^3} + \\frac{3(10) \\ln \\lambda}{\\lambda^3} = 2.5\n$$\nTo find the roots $\\lambda_1$ and $\\lambda_2$, we must solve the transcendental equation:\n$$\ns(\\lambda) - 2.5 = 0 \\iff \\frac{1}{\\lambda} - \\frac{1}{\\lambda^3} + \\frac{30 \\ln \\lambda}{\\lambda^3} - 2.5 = 0\n$$\nMultiplying by $\\lambda^3$ gives an equivalent form for numerical root finding:\n$$\nh(\\lambda) = \\lambda^2 - 1 + 30 \\ln \\lambda - 2.5 \\lambda^3 = 0\n$$\nThis equation must be solved numerically.

In a three-dimensional Euclidean space $\\mathbb{R}^3$, the set of all rigid body motions constitutes a finite-dimensional vector space, denoted by $\\mathcal{R}$. Any vector field $\\boldsymbol{u} \\in \\mathcal{R}$ can be expressed in the form:\n$$\\boldsymbol{u}(\\boldsymbol{x}) = \\boldsymbol{c} + \\boldsymbol{\\omega} \\times \\boldsymbol{x}$$\nwhere $\\boldsymbol{c}$ is a constant translation vector and $\\boldsymbol{\\omega}$ is a constant angular velocity vector (representing an infinitesimal rotation). The vector $\\boldsymbol{c}$ has $3$ independent components and the vector $\\boldsymbol{\\omega}$ has $3$ independent components. Therefore, the dimension of the space of rigid body motions $\\mathcal{R}$ in $\\mathbb{R}^3$ is $3+3=6$.\n\nThe nullspace of the problem is the set of functions that are both rigid body motions and members of the admissible space $V$. That is, we seek the dimension of the space $\\mathcal{N} = \\mathcal{R} \\cap V$.\nThe space $V$ is defined as $V := \\{ \\boldsymbol{v} \\in H^{1}(\\Omega;\\mathbb{R}^{3}) : \\text{the trace of } \\boldsymbol{v} \\text{ equals } \\boldsymbol{0} \\text{ on } \\Gamma_{D} \\}$.\nThe functions describing rigid body motions are linear in $\\boldsymbol{x}$, and thus are infinitely differentiable ($C^{\\infty}$) over all of $\\mathbb{R}^3$. Consequently, they belong to the Sobolev space $H^{1}(\\Omega;\\mathbb{R}^{3})$. The only remaining condition for a rigid body motion $\\boldsymbol{u}$ to be in $V$ is that its trace must vanish on $\\Gamma_{D}$.\n\nThe critical piece of information is that $\\Gamma_{D}$ has a surface measure of zero. The trace operator $\\gamma: H^{1}(\\Omega) \\to H^{1/2}(\\partial\\Omega)$ maps functions in the Sobolev space $H^1$ to a space of functions on the boundary, $H^{1/2}$. A defining property of Sobolev spaces like $H^{1/2}(\\partial\\Omega)$ is that functions are considered equivalent if they differ only on a set of measure zero. Imposing a condition on a function in $H^{1/2}(\\partial\\Omega)$ over a set of zero surface measure imposes no actual constraint on the function itself. In other words, the condition that `the trace of v equals 0 on Γ_D` is vacuous because the \"support\" of the constraint has zero measure.\nTherefore, the space $V$ is not a proper subset of $H^{1}(\\Omega;\\mathbb{R}^{3})$; rather, it is identical to it:\n$$V = H^{1}(\\Omega;\\mathbb{R}^{3})$$\nThis is because a standard result of trace theory is that Korn's inequality, which is required for the coercivity of $a(\\cdot,\\cdot)$ and thus for uniqueness, fails if the Dirichlet boundary conditions are not imposed on a part of the boundary with a positive surface measure. The condition on $\\Gamma_D$ is insufficient to eliminate any rigid body motions.\n\nThe problem thus reduces to finding the dimension of the intersection $\\mathcal{R} \\cap H^{1}(\\Omega;\\mathbb{R}^{3})$. As all rigid body motions are smooth functions, they are necessarily in $H^{1}(\\Omega;\\mathbb{R}^{3})$. The intersection is therefore the entire space of rigid body motions, $\\mathcal{R}$.\n$$\\mathcal{N} = \\mathcal{R} \\cap H^{1}(\\Omega;\\mathbb{R}^{3}) = \\mathcal{R}$$\nThe dimension of the nullspace of the problem is the dimension of $\\mathcal{R}$. For a body in $\\mathbb{R}^3$, this dimension is $6$. These $6$ modes correspond to $3$ independent translations and $3$ independent infinitesimal rotations. The system of equations models a body in space with no attachment points (or, more precisely, attachments on a set too small to prevent motion), subject to no external forces. Naturally, this body is free to translate and rotate. Any such rigid motion is a valid, non-trivial solution to the homogeneous problem.\n\nThe counterexample to uniqueness is any non-zero rigid body motion, for example, a pure translation $\\boldsymbol{u}(\\boldsymbol{x}) = \\boldsymbol{e}_1$. This field has zero strain, so $a(\\boldsymbol{u},\\boldsymbol{v})=0$ for all $\\boldsymbol{v}$. Since its trace on a finite set of points is non-zero in general, one might think it is excluded. However, the definition of $V$ within the framework of Sobolev spaces renders such point-wise constraints irrelevant. The dimension of the space of all such counterexamples is $6$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{6}\n$$", "id": "2708899"}]}
