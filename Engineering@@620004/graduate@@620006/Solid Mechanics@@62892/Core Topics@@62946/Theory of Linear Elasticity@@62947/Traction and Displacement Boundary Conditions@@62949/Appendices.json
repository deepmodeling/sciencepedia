A complete solution will be provided.\n\n**Derivation**\n\nThe fundamental law governing the relationship between internal stresses and surface forces is the balance of linear momentum. For a body in static equilibrium with no body forces, the differential form of this law is $\\nabla \\cdot \\sigma = \\mathbf{0}$. The integral form of this same law, when applied to an infinitesimal tetrahedron element, yields Cauchy's traction theorem. This theorem states that the traction vector $t$ acting on a surface with an outward unit normal $n$ is given by a linear transformation of the normal vector by the stress tensor $\\sigma$. In indicial notation, this is $t_i = \\sigma_{ji}n_j$. We will use this theorem, as it is a direct consequence of the requested fundamental principle.\n\nThe Cauchy stress tensor $\\sigma$ and the unit normal vector $n$ are given in a Cartesian basis as:\n$$\n\\sigma = \\begin{pmatrix} \\sigma_{1} & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & \\sigma_{2} & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & \\sigma_{3} \\end{pmatrix}, \\quad n = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\\\ \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nAccording to Cauchy's traction theorem, the traction vector $t(n)$ is the product of the stress tensor and the normal vector:\n$$\nt(n) = \\sigma n = \\begin{pmatrix} \\sigma_{1} & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & \\sigma_{2} & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & \\sigma_{3} \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\\\ \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{\\sigma_{1}}{\\sqrt{2}} \\\\ \\frac{\\sigma_{2}}{\\sqrt{2}} \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nNext, we decompose the traction vector $t(n)$ into its normal and tangential components. The traction vector is the sum of its projection onto the normal vector $n$ (the normal component, $t_{\\mathrm{norm}}$) and its projection onto the plane perpendicular to $n$ (the tangential or shear component, $t_{\\mathrm{tan}}$):\n$$\nt(n) = t_{\\mathrm{norm}} + t_{\\mathrm{tan}}\n$$\nThe normal component is the projection of $t(n)$ onto the direction of $n$. Its vector form is given by $t_{\\mathrm{norm}} = (t(n) \\cdot n)n$. The scalar part, $t(n) \\cdot n$, is the magnitude of the normal traction (positive for tension, negative for compression). We compute this scalar first:\n$$\nt(n) \\cdot n = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{\\sigma_{1}}{\\sqrt{2}} \\\\ \\frac{\\sigma_{2}}{\\sqrt{2}} \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\cdot \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\\\ \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix} = \\left(\\frac{\\sigma_{1}}{\\sqrt{2}}\\right)\\left(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\right) + \\left(\\frac{\\sigma_{2}}{\\sqrt{2}}\\right)\\left(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\right) + (0)(0) = \\frac{\\sigma_{1}}{2} + \\frac{\\sigma_{2}}{2} = \\frac{\\sigma_{1} + \\sigma_{2}}{2}\n$$\nThe magnitude of the normal traction is therefore $|t(n) \\cdot n| = \\left|\\frac{\\sigma_{1} + \\sigma_{2}}{2}\\right|$.\n\nThe tangential component vector $t_{\\mathrm{tan}}$ is found by subtracting the normal component vector from the total traction vector:\n$$\nt_{\\mathrm{tan}} = t(n) - t_{\\mathrm{norm}} = t(n) - (t(n) \\cdot n)n\n$$\n$$\nt_{\\mathrm{tan}} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{\\sigma_{1}}{\\sqrt{2}} \\\\ \\frac{\\sigma_{2}}{\\sqrt{2}} \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix} - \\left(\\frac{\\sigma_{1} + \\sigma_{2}}{2}\\right) \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\\\ \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\n$$\nt_{\\mathrm{tan}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\begin{pmatrix} \\sigma_{1} - \\frac{\\sigma_{1} + \\sigma_{2}}{2} \\\\ \\sigma_{2} - \\frac{\\sigma_{1} + \\sigma_{2}}{2} \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{1}{2\\sqrt{2}} \\begin{pmatrix} 2\\sigma_{1} - \\sigma_{1} - \\sigma_{2} \\\\ 2\\sigma_{2} - \\sigma_{1} - \\sigma_{2} \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{1}{2\\sqrt{2}} \\begin{pmatrix} \\sigma_{1} - \\sigma_{2} \\\\ \\sigma_{2} - \\sigma_{1} \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{\\sigma_{1} - \\sigma_{2}}{2\\sqrt{2}} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ -1 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe magnitude of the tangential (shear) traction, $\\|t_{\\mathrm{tan}}\\|$, is the Euclidean norm of this vector:\n$$\n\\|t_{\\mathrm{tan}}\\| = \\left\\| \\frac{\\sigma_{1} - \\sigma_{2}}{2\\sqrt{2}} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ -1 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\right\\| = \\left| \\frac{\\sigma_{1} - \\sigma_{2}}{2\\sqrt{2}} \\right| \\sqrt{1^{2} + (-1)^{2} + 0^{2}} = \\frac{|\\sigma_{1} - \\sigma_{2}|}{2\\sqrt{2}} \\sqrt{2} = \\frac{|\\sigma_{1} - \\sigma_{2}|}{2}\n$$\nNow we compute the required ratio $r$:\n$$\nr = \\frac{\\|t_{\\mathrm{tan}}\\|}{|t(n)\\cdot n|} = \\frac{\\frac{|\\sigma_{1} - \\sigma_{2}|}{2}}{\\left|\\frac{\\sigma_{1} + \\sigma_{2}}{2}\\right|} = \\frac{|\\sigma_{1} - \\sigma_{2}|}{|\\sigma_{1} + \\sigma_{2}|}\n$$\nThis expression is well-defined provided that the denominator is non-zero, i.e., $\\sigma_{1} + \\sigma_{2} \\neq 0$. If $\\sigma_{1} = -\\sigma_{2}$, the normal traction on this specific plane is zero, and the ratio $r$ is undefined.\n\n**Physical Interpretation in the Context of Boundary Conditions**\nIn solid mechanics, boundary value problems require specifying conditions on the boundary of the domain. These conditions are typically of two types: traction or displacement.\n1.  **Traction Boundary Conditions (Neumann type):** These prescribe the traction vector $t$ on a portion of the boundary. The normal component, $(t \\cdot n)$, represents a normal force per unit area, causing tension or compression. For example, a pressure loading on a surface is a prescribed normal traction. The tangential component, $t_{\\mathrm{tan}}$, represents a shear force per unit area, tending to slide material layers relative to one another. An example is a frictional force acting along a surface.\n2.  **Displacement Boundary Conditions (Dirichlet type):** These prescribe the displacement vector $u$ on a portion of the boundary. For instance, a fixed boundary has $u = \\mathbf{0}$. A roller support might constrain the normal component of displacement ($u \\cdot n = 0$) while leaving the tangential displacement free.\n\nThe normal and tangential components of traction are crucial because in a well-posed problem, one cannot simultaneously prescribe traction and displacement in the same direction at the same boundary point. If the normal displacement is prescribed (e.g., a surface is in contact with a rigid, frictionless wall), the normal traction becomes a reaction force determined by the solution. Conversely, if the normal traction is prescribed (e.g., a surface is exposed to a known pressure), the normal displacement is an unknown to be found. The same principle applies to tangential components. This duality is fundamental to formulating and solving problems in elasticity.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\frac{|\\sigma_{1} - \\sigma_{2}|}{|\\sigma_{1} + \\sigma_{2}|}}\n$$", "id": "2706166"}, {"introduction": "For a boundary value problem in solid mechanics to have a unique, stable solution, the body must be adequately constrained against rigid-body motion.

It is a standard, non-trivial conceptual problem.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem statement is valid. A full solution will be derived.\n\n### Derivation of the Solution\n\nThe solution requires two separate analyses: one for the rigid body modes and one for static determinacy.\n\n**Part 1: Analysis of Rigid Body Modes**\n\nIn a planar ($2$D) problem, the most general infinitesimal rigid body displacement field, $\\mathbf{u}^{RB}$, can be expressed as the sum of a constant translation and an infinitesimal rotation about the origin. In component form, for a point $(x,y)$, this is:\n$$u_{x}^{RB}(x,y) = c_{x} - \\omega y$$\n$$u_{y}^{RB}(x,y) = c_{y} + \\omega x$$\nHere, $(c_{x}, c_{y})$ represents the components of a uniform translation vector, and $\\omega$ is the angle of infinitesimal rotation about the origin $(0,0)$. These three parameters, $c_{x}$, $c_{y}$, and $\\omega$, define the $3$ independent rigid body modes for a planar body: two translations and one rotation.\n\nTo determine how many of these modes are eliminated by the given Dirichlet boundary conditions, we must find which modes are only possible if their defining parameters are zero. We apply the given boundary conditions to the general rigid body displacement field.\n\n1.  **Condition on the left edge ($x=0$):** $u_{x}(0,y)=0$ for all $y \\in [0, H]$.\n    Substituting the rigid body displacement into this condition yields:\n    $$u_{x}^{RB}(0,y) = c_{x} - \\omega y = 0 \\quad \\forall y \\in [0, H]$$\n    This equation expresses that a polynomial in $y$ is zero over an interval. This is only possible if all coefficients of the polynomial are zero.\n    - The coefficient of $y^{1}$ is $-\\omega$, so we must have $\\omega = 0$.\n    - The constant term ($y^{0}$) is $c_{x}$, so we must have $c_{x} = 0$.\n\n2.  **Condition on the bottom edge ($y=0$):** $u_{y}(x,0)=0$ for all $x \\in [0, L]$.\n    Substituting the rigid body displacement into this condition yields:\n    $$u_{y}^{RB}(x,0) = c_{y} + \\omega x = 0 \\quad \\forall x \\in [0, L]$$\n    Similarly, this polynomial in $x$ must be identically zero over the interval $[0, L]$, which means all its coefficients must be zero.\n    - The coefficient of $x^{1}$ is $\\omega$, so we must have $\\omega = 0$.\n    - The constant term ($x^{0}$) is $c_{y}$, so we must have $c_{y} = 0$.\n\nCombining the constraints from both boundary conditions, we find that for a rigid body motion to be compatible with the specified kinematic constraints, its parameters must satisfy $c_{x}=0$, $c_{y}=0$, and $\\omega=0$. This means the only possible rigid body motion is the trivial one, $\\mathbf{u}^{RB} = \\mathbf{0}$. Therefore, all $3$ independent rigid body modes are constrained, or eliminated. The boundary conditions are sufficient to ensure a unique displacement solution for the elasticity problem.\n\n**Part 2: Analysis of Static Determinacy**\n\nA boundary value problem is defined as **statically determinate** if the internal stress field, represented by the Cauchy stress tensor $\\sigma_{ij}$, can be determined everywhere within the body $\\Omega$ using only the equations of equilibrium and the traction boundary conditions on $\\Gamma_{t}$, without recourse to the constitutive law or compatibility equations.\n\nIn the absence of body forces, the quasistatic equilibrium equations in $2$D are:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial \\sigma_{xx}}{\\partial x} + \\frac{\\partial \\sigma_{xy}}{\\partial y} = 0 $$\n$$ \\frac{\\partial \\sigma_{xy}}{\\partial x} + \\frac{\\partial \\sigma_{yy}}{\\partial y} = 0 $$\nThese are two partial differential equations for the three unknown stress components: $\\sigma_{xx}(x,y)$, $\\sigma_{yy}(x,y)$, and $\\sigma_{xy}(x,y)$.\n\nThis system of equations is mathematically underdetermined. There are more unknown functions than there are equations. A unique solution for the stress field cannot be obtained from these equations alone, even with the prescribed tractions on part of the boundary. To obtain a unique solution, one must enforce the compatibility equations for the strain field. The strain field, in turn, is related to the stress field via the constitutive law of the material (in this case, Hooke's law for a linear-elastic material).\n\nSince determining the stress field requires not just static equilibrium but also kinematic compatibility and the stress-strain relationship, the problem is **statically indeterminate**. The specific displacement constraints on $\\Gamma_{u}$ influence the strain field and, consequently, the stress field, making it impossible to determine the stresses from external forces alone. Problems in plane elasticity are generally statically indeterminate, with very specific exceptions (e.g., problems reducible to $1$D, or certain truss/beam idealizations not applicable here).\n\n**Conclusion**\n\n- Exactly $3$ rigid body modes are constrained.\n- The system is statically indeterminate.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n- **A.

The left end $x=0$ is physically clamped and should be modeled by $u(0)=0$, but is mistakenly modeled as traction-free, $\\bar{t}(0)=0$. Then the static boundary-value problem has no solution, because global equilibrium requires $\\int_{\\partial \\Omega} \\bar{t}\\,dS + \\int_{\\Omega} b\\,dV = 0$, yet the resultant of the applied tractions equals $P\\neq 0$. The mechanism is violation of balance of linear momentum for a static configuration; the bar would undergo rigid-body acceleration in reality.\n\nB. The same bar with $b=0$ is loaded by equal and opposite end tractions $\\bar{t}(L)=P/A$ and $\\bar{t}(0)=-P/A$, while no displacement boundary condition is imposed anywhere (the physical clamp is replaced by a traction). Then the strain and stress fields are unique, but the displacement field is nonunique: $u(x)$ is determined only up to an arbitrary additive constant. The mechanism is the presence of a rigid-body translation mode when only traction (natural) boundary conditions are imposed and the resultant force and moment vanish.\n\nC. A vertical bar of length $L$ with body force $b=\\rho g>0$ uniformly downward (with $\\rho$ the density and $g$ the gravitational acceleration) has both ends mistakenly modeled as traction-free, $\\bar{t}(0)=0$ and $\\bar{t}(L)=0$, although physically the top end should be clamped, $u(0)=0$. Then the static boundary-value problem has no solution, because integrating $\\dfrac{d\\sigma}{dx} + \\rho g = 0$ gives $\\sigma(x)=-\\rho g x + C$, and applying $\\sigma(0)=0$ and $\\sigma(L)=0$ forces $\\rho g L = 0$, a contradiction for $L>0$ and $\\rho g>0$. The mechanism is that the nonzero resultant body force $\\int_{\\Omega} b\\,dV$ is unbalanced by surface tractions in statics.\n\nD. In the setting of option B, if one additionally imposes $u(x^\\star)=0$ at a single point $x^\\star \\in (0,L)$ (while keeping the end tractions unchanged), the displacement field remains nonunique.

The boundary conditions demand $\\sigma(0) = -\\bar{t}(0)=0$ and $\\sigma(L) = \\bar{t}(L)=P/A$, which are incompatible unless $P=0$.

Then $\\dfrac{du}{dx} = \\sigma/E = (P/A)/E$, so $u(x) = \\left(\\dfrac{P}{AE}\\right) x + C_0$ for an arbitrary constant $C_0$. The stress $\\sigma$ and strain $\\varepsilon$ are unique, but the displacement has an undetermined additive constant $C_0$, which is precisely the one-dimensional rigid-body translation. This nonuniqueness is the standard consequence of a pure traction problem with vanishing resultant force and moment. Verdict: Correct.\n\nOption C. Data: vertical bar with body force $b=\\rho g>0$ downward, and both ends traction-free: $\\bar{t}(0)=0$, $\\bar{t}(L)=0$ (erroneously modeling a physically clamped top as free). Equilibrium gives\n$$\n\\frac{d\\sigma}{dx} + \\rho g = 0 \\;\\Rightarrow\\; \\sigma(x) = -\\rho g\\, x + C.\n$$\nTraction-free ends imply $\\sigma(0) = -\\bar{t}(0) = 0$ and $\\sigma(L) = \\bar{t}(L) = 0$. The first condition gives $C=0$, and the second gives $-\\rho g\\, L = 0$, which is impossible for $L>0$ and $\\rho g>0$. Equivalently, the global equilibrium condition fails:\n$$\nA\\,\\bar{t}(L) + A\\,\\bar{t}(0) + \\int_0^L A\\, (\\rho g)\\, dx \\;=\\; 0 + 0 + A\\,\\rho g\\, L \\;\\neq\\; 0.\n$$\nThus, no static solution exists. Physically, the weight is unbalanced, so in reality the body would accelerate; the static model is ill-posed under these boundary conditions. Verdict: Correct.\n\nOption D. This option augments the setting of option B by fixing the displacement at a single internal point $x^\\star \\in (0,L)$: $u(x^\\star)=0$. The difference of any two displacement solutions $\\tilde{u}(x)$ under the same tractions with $b=0$ satisfies the homogeneous problem with zero tractions; by the uniqueness theorem (or by the energy argument), this implies $\\tilde{\\varepsilon} = \\dfrac{d\\tilde{u}}{dx} = 0$ everywhere, hence $\\tilde{u}(x) = C_0$, a spatially constant rigid-body translation. Imposing $u(x^\\star)=0$ for both solutions enforces $\\tilde{u}(x^\\star)=0$, which forces $C_0=0$. Therefore the displacement field becomes unique. In one dimension, fixing a single point eliminates the only rigid-body mode (translation). Hence the claim that the displacement remains nonunique is false. Verdict: Incorrect.\n\nSummary. Options A, B, and C are correct; option D is incorrect.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{ABC}$$", "id": "2706155"}]}
