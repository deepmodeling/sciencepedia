It is a standard derivation within the classical theory of linear elasticity. Therefore, a solution will be provided.\n\nThe starting point for this analysis is the set of constitutive equations for a linear, isotropic, elastic material, known as the generalized Hooke's Law. For a general three-dimensional state of stress, the normal strains in the principal directions are related to the principal normal stresses by the following equations:\n$$ \\varepsilon_1 = \\frac{1}{E} [ \\sigma_1 - \\nu(\\sigma_2 + \\sigma_3) ] $$\n$$ \\varepsilon_2 = \\frac{1}{E} [ \\sigma_2 - \\nu(\\sigma_1 + \\sigma_3) ] $$\n$$ \\varepsilon_3 = \\frac{1}{E} [ \\sigma_3 - \\nu(\\sigma_1 + \\sigma_2) ] $$\nHere, $E$ represents the Young's modulus, $\\nu$ is the Poisson's ratio, $\\sigma_i$ are the principal stresses, and $\\varepsilon_i$ are the principal strains.\n\nFor the thick-walled cylinder described in the problem, the geometry is axisymmetric, making it natural to work in a cylindrical coordinate system $(r, \\theta, z)$.

Maximum Stress Analysis**\nFor the radial stress $\\sigma_r(r)$, the term $(1 - b^2/r^2)$ is non-positive for $r \\in [a, b]$. Its value increases from a minimum at $r=a$ to $0$ at $r=b$. Thus, the maximum (least negative) radial stress is $\\sigma_{r,\\max} = \\sigma_r(b) = 0$.\n\nFor the hoop stress $\\sigma_\\theta(r)$, since $p>0$ and $b>a$, the coefficient $\\frac{p a^2}{b^2 - a^2}$ is positive. The term $(1 + b^2/r^2)$ is a positive, monotonically decreasing function of $r$. Therefore, the hoop stress is always tensile ($\\sigma_\\theta > 0$) and its maximum value occurs at the minimum radius, $r=a$.\n$$ \\sigma_{\\theta,\\max} = \\sigma_\\theta(a) = \\frac{p a^2}{b^2 - a^2}\\left(1 + \\frac{b^2}{a^2}\\right) = \\frac{p a^2}{b^2 - a^2}\\left(\\frac{a^2+b^2}{a^2}\\right) = p\\frac{a^2+b^2}{b^2-a^2} $$\nUsing the numerical values $a=10\\,\\mathrm{mm}$, $b=30\\,\\mathrm{mm}$, and $p=300\\,\\mathrm{MPa}$:\n$$ \\sigma_{\\theta,\\max} = (300\\,\\mathrm{MPa})\\frac{(30\\,\\mathrm{mm})^2+(10\\,\\mathrm{mm})^2}{(30\\,\\mathrm{mm})^2-(10\\,\\mathrm{mm})^2} = 300\\frac{900+100}{900-100} = 300\\frac{1000}{800} = 300 \\times 1.25 = 375\\,\\mathrm{MPa} $$\nThe maximum values are:\n$\\sigma_{r,\\max} = 0\\,\\mathrm{MPa}$ at $r=b=30\\,\\mathrm{mm}$.\n$\\sigma_{\\theta,\\max} = 375\\,\\mathrm{MPa}$ at $r=a=10\\,\\mathrm{mm}$.\n\n**4. Sensitivity Analysis**\nWe define the thickness ratio $\\lambda = b/a$ and the dimensionless peak-hoop-stress function $f(\\lambda) = \\sigma_{\\theta,\\max}/p$.\nFrom the expression for $\\sigma_{\\theta,\\max}$, we have:\n$$ f(\\lambda) = \\frac{a^2+b^2}{b^2-a^2} $$\nDividing the numerator and denominator by $a^2$:\n$$ f(\\lambda) = \\frac{1+(b/a)^2}{(b/a)^2-1} = \\frac{1+\\lambda^2}{\\lambda^2-1} $$\nTo find the sensitivity, we differentiate $f(\\lambda)$ with respect to $\\lambda$ using the quotient rule:\n$$ \\frac{\\mathrm{d}f}{\\mathrm{d}\\lambda} = \\frac{(2\\lambda)(\\lambda^2-1) - (\\lambda^2+1)(2\\lambda)}{(\\lambda^2-1)^2} = \\frac{2\\lambda^3 - 2\\lambda - 2\\lambda^3 - 2\\lambda}{(\\lambda^2-1)^2} = \\frac{-4\\lambda}{(\\lambda^2-1)^2} $$\nWe must evaluate this sensitivity at $\\lambda = 3$, which corresponds to the given dimensions ($b/a = 30/10 = 3$).\n$$ S = \\left.\\frac{\\mathrm{d}f}{\\mathrm{d}\\lambda}\\right|_{\\lambda=3} = \\frac{-4(3)}{(3^2-1)^2} = \\frac{-12}{(9-1)^2} = \\frac{-12}{8^2} = \\frac{-12}{64} = -\\frac{3}{16} = -0.1875 $$\nThis value has four significant figures, so no further rounding is needed.\n\n**5. Discussion**\nThe function $f(\\lambda) = \\sigma_{\\theta,\\max}/p$ quantifies the severity of the hoop stress at the bore. The sensitivity $\\mathrm{d}f/\\mathrm{d}\\lambda$ measures how effectively this peak stress is reduced by increasing the wall thickness ratio $\\lambda$.\nThe derivative, $\\mathrm{d}f/\\mathrm{d}\\lambda = -4\\lambda/(\\lambda^2-1)^2$, is always negative for $\\lambda > 1$. This confirms the intuitive fact that making the cylinder wall thicker reduces the peak operating stress.\nHowever, the magnitude of this derivative, $|\\mathrm{d}f/\\mathrm{d}\\lambda|$, approaches $0$ as $\\lambda \\to \\infty$ (specifically, it decays as $4/\\lambda^3$). This indicates a principle of diminishing returns: for an already thick cylinder (large $\\lambda$), adding more material becomes an increasingly inefficient method for reducing the peak stress. The limiting value is $\\lim_{\\lambda\\to\\infty} f(\\lambda) = 1$, meaning the peak hoop stress can never be reduced below the internal pressure $p$ by simply thickening the wall.\nThis inefficiency highlights the qualitative need for and benefit of autofrettage. When a design is constrained by the allowable peak tensile stress, and simply increasing wall thickness is impractical (due to weight, cost, or a high $\\lambda$ value where diminishing returns are significant), autofrettage provides a superior alternative. By inducing a favorable compressive residual stress field at the bore, autofrettage directly counteracts the high tensile stress where it is most critical, thereby increasing the pressure-carrying capacity in a much more material-efficient manner than simply increasing $b$. The small magnitude of the sensitivity at $\\lambda=3$ ($S=-0.1875$) numerically supports this conclusion.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{-0.1875}\n$$", "id": "2680720"}, {"introduction": "The autofrettage process is fundamentally about inducing controlled plastic deformation to create beneficial residual stresses.

The von Mises stress is defined as:\n$$\n\\sigma_v = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{2}\\left[(\\sigma_1-\\sigma_2)^2 + (\\sigma_2-\\sigma_3)^2 + (\\sigma_3-\\sigma_1)^2\\right]}\n$$\nFor a plane stress condition ($\\sigma_z=0$), where $\\sigma_z$ is the intermediate principal stress ($\\sigma_1 > \\sigma_2 > \\sigma_3$), the expression simplifies to $\\sigma_v^2 = \\sigma_1^2 - \\sigma_1\\sigma_3 + \\sigma_3^2$. At $r=a$, we have $\\sigma_1 = \\sigma_\\theta(a)$, $\\sigma_2=0$, and $\\sigma_3 = \\sigma_r(a)$, so this simplification is valid.\nLet $p_{y}^{\\text{von Mises}}$ be the pressure at yield. The principal stresses at $r=a$ are $\\sigma_1 = p_{y}^{\\text{von Mises}} \\frac{b^2+a^2}{b^2-a^2}$ and $\\sigma_3 = -p_{y}^{\\text{von Mises}}$.\n$$\n\\sigma_y^2 = \\left( p_{y}^{\\text{von Mises}} \\frac{b^2+a^2}{b^2-a^2} \\right)^2 - \\left( p_{y}^{\\text{von Mises}} \\frac{b^2+a^2}{b^2-a^2} \\right) (-p_{y}^{\\text{von Mises}}) + (-p_{y}^{\\text{von Mises}})^2\n$$\n$$\n\\sigma_y^2 = (p_{y}^{\\text{von Mises}})^2 \\left[ \\left(\\frac{b^2+a^2}{b^2-a^2}\\right)^2 + \\frac{b^2+a^2}{b^2-a^2} + 1 \\right]\n$$\nCombining the terms in the bracket over a common denominator $(b^2-a^2)^2$:\n$$\n\\frac{(b^2+a^2)^2 + (b^2+a^2)(b^2-a^2) + (b^2-a^2)^2}{(b^2-a^2)^2} = \\frac{(b^4+2a^2b^2+a^4) + (b^4-a^4) + (b^4-2a^2b^2+a^4)}{(b^2-a^2)^2}\n$$\n$$\n= \\frac{3b^4+a^4}{(b^2-a^2)^2}\n$$\nSo, the von Mises criterion becomes:\n$$\n\\sigma_y^2 = (p_{y}^{\\text{von Mises}})^2 \\frac{3b^4+a^4}{(b^2-a^2)^2}\n$$\nSolving for the onset pressure according to von Mises:\n$$\np_{y}^{\\text{von Mises}} = \\sigma_y \\sqrt{\\frac{(b^2-a^2)^2}{3b^4+a^4}} = \\frac{\\sigma_y (b^2-a^2)}{\\sqrt{3b^4+a^4}}\n$$\nFinally, we compute the ratio of the two predictions for the onset pressure:\n$$\n\\frac{p_{y}^{\\text{Tresca}}}{p_{y}^{\\text{von Mises}}} = \\frac{\\frac{\\sigma_y}{2} \\frac{b^2 - a^2}{b^2}}{\\frac{\\sigma_y (b^2-a^2)}{\\sqrt{3b^4+a^4}}} = \\frac{1}{2b^2} \\frac{\\sqrt{3b^4+a^4}}{1} = \\frac{\\sqrt{3b^4+a^4}}{2b^2}\n$$\nTo express this in terms of the nondimensional radius ratio $a/b$, we factor $b^4$ out of the square root:\n$$\n\\frac{p_{y}^{\\text{Tresca}}}{p_{y}^{\\text{von Mises}}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{b^4(3 + a^4/b^4)}}{2b^2} = \\frac{b^2 \\sqrt{3 + (a/b)^4}}{2b^2} = \\frac{\\sqrt{3 + (a/b)^4}}{2}\n$$\nThis is the required final expression for the ratio.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\frac{\\sqrt{3+\\left(\\frac{a}{b}\\right)^4}}{2}}\n$$", "id": "2680768"}]}
