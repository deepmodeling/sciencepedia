It is a standard exercise in the plastic analysis of beams from solid mechanics. All necessary definitions and geometric parameters are provided, and there are no contradictions or ambiguities. The problem is valid and a solution will be provided.\n\nLet us establish a coordinate system where the base of the triangular cross-section, of width $b$, lies on the $x$-axis, extending from $x = -b/2$ to $x = b/2$. The axis of symmetry is the $y$-axis, with the origin at the center of the base. The apex of the triangle is at $(0, h)$. The vertical position is measured by the coordinate $y$, where $y=0$ corresponds to the base.\n\nThe width of the triangle at a height $y$ from the base, denoted $w(y)$, can be determined by considering similar triangles:\n$$\n\\frac{w(y)}{h-y} = \\frac{b}{h} \\implies w(y) = \\frac{b}{h}(h-y)\n$$\nThe total cross-sectional area $A$ is given by:\n$$\nA = \\frac{1}{2}bh\n$$\n\n**1. Determination of the Plastic Neutral Axis ($y_p$)**\n\nThe problem states that the plastic neutral axis (PNA), located at a vertical position $y = y_p$, partitions the cross-sectional area into two equal areas. The total area is $A$, so the area on either side of the PNA must be $A/2$. Let us calculate the area of the region above the PNA ($A_{above}$) and set it equal to $A/2$. This region is a smaller triangle with height $h' = h - y_p$ and base $b' = w(y_p) = \\frac{b}{h}(h-y_p)$.\n\nThe area of this upper triangle is:\n$$\nA_{above} = \\frac{1}{2} b' h' = \\frac{1}{2} \\left[ \\frac{b}{h}(h-y_p) \\right] (h-y_p) = \\frac{b}{2h}(h-y_p)^2\n$$\nAccording to the definition of the PNA, this area must be half of the total area:\n$$\nA_{above} = \\frac{A}{2} = \\frac{1}{2} \\left( \\frac{1}{2}bh \\right) = \\frac{bh}{4}\n$$\nEquating the two expressions for $A_{above}$:\n$$\n\\frac{b}{2h}(h-y_p)^2 = \\frac{bh}{4}\n$$\nSolving for $(h-y_p)$:\n$$\n(h-y_p)^2 = \\frac{bh}{4} \\cdot \\frac{2h}{b} = \\frac{h^2}{2}\n$$\nTaking the square root of both sides (and noting that $h > y_p$):\n$$\nh - y_p = \\sqrt{\\frac{h^2}{2}} = \\frac{h}{\\sqrt{2}}\n$$\nThus, the location of the PNA, measured upward from the base, is:\n$$\ny_p = h - \\frac{h}{\\sqrt{2}} = h\\left(1 - \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\right) = h\\left(1 - \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}\\right)\n$$\n\n**2. Derivation of the Plastic Section Modulus ($Z_p$)**\n\nThe plastic section modulus $Z_p$ is defined as the first moment of the cross-sectional area about the PNA. It can be calculated by integrating over the entire area $A$:\n$$\nZ_p = \\int_A |y - y_p| \\, dA\n$$\nwhere a differential area element $dA$ is given by $dA = w(y) \\, dy$. Substituting the expression for $w(y)$:\n$$\nZ_p = \\int_0^h |y - y_p| \\frac{b}{h}(h-y) \\, dy\n$$\nWe must split the integral at $y = y_p$ to resolve the absolute value:\n$$\nZ_p = \\int_0^{y_p} (y_p - y) \\frac{b}{h}(h-y) \\, dy + \\int_{y_p}^h (y - y_p) \\frac{b}{h}(h-y) \\, dy\n$$\nThe first integral represents the first moment of the area below the PNA ($A_{below}$), and the second integral represents the first moment of the area above the PNA ($A_{above}$). Let's denote them as $Q_{below}$ and $Q_{above}$, respectively.\n$$\nZ_p = Q_{below} + Q_{above}\n$$\nLet us evaluate $Q_{above}$ first. This corresponds to the first moment of the small triangle of height $h' = h-y_p$ about its base (the PNA).\n$$\nQ_{above} = \\int_{y_p}^h (y - y_p) \\frac{b}{h}(h-y) \\, dy\n$$\nLet $u = y-y_p$, so $du = dy$. The limits become $u=0$ to $u=h-y_p$.\n$y-y_p = u$ and $h-y = h-(u+y_p) = (h-y_p) - u$.\n$$\nQ_{above} = \\frac{b}{h} \\int_0^{h-y_p} u((h-y_p)-u) \\, du = \\frac{b}{h} \\left[ (h-y_p)\\frac{u^2}{2} - \\frac{u^3}{3} \\right]_0^{h-y_p}\n$$\n$$\nQ_{above} = \\frac{b}{h} \\left( \\frac{(h-y_p)^3}{2} - \\frac{(h-y_p)^3}{3} \\right) = \\frac{b}{h} \\frac{(h-y_p)^3}{6}\n$$\nSubstituting $h-y_p = h/\\sqrt{2}$:\n$$\nQ_{above} = \\frac{b}{6h} \\left( \\frac{h}{\\sqrt{2}} \\right)^3 = \\frac{b}{6h} \\frac{h^3}{2\\sqrt{2}} = \\frac{bh^2}{12\\sqrt{2}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{2}bh^2}{24}\n$$\nNow, let's evaluate $Z_p$ using the integral expression for both parts combined:\n$$\nZ_p = \\frac{b}{h} \\left[ \\int_0^{y_p} (y_p h - y_p y - hy + y^2) dy + \\int_{y_p}^h (yh - y_p h - y^2 + y_p y) dy \\right]\n$$\n$$\nZ_p = \\frac{b}{h} \\left[ \\left( y_p h y - \\frac{(y_p+h)y^2}{2} + \\frac{y^3}{3} \\right)_0^{y_p} + \\left( \\frac{(h+y_p)y^2}{2} - y_p h y - \\frac{y^3}{3} \\right)_{y_p}^h \\right]\n$$\nEvaluating the first bracket (for $Q_{below}$):\n$$\n\\frac{b}{h} \\left( y_p^2 h - \\frac{(y_p+h)y_p^2}{2} + \\frac{y_p^3}{3} \\right) = \\frac{b y_p^2}{h} \\left( h - \\frac{y_p+h}{2} + \\frac{y_p}{3} \\right) = \\frac{b y_p^2}{6h} (3h - y_p)\n$$\nEvaluating the second bracket (for $Q_{above}$):\n$$\n\\frac{b}{h} \\left[ \\left( \\frac{h^3+y_p h^2}{2} - y_p h^2 - \\frac{h^3}{3} \\right) - \\left( \\frac{h y_p^2+y_p^3}{2} - y_p^2 h - \\frac{y_p^3}{3} \\right) \\right] = \\frac{b}{6h} (h-y_p)^3\n$$\nThis confirms the previous calculation for $Q_{above}$. So, $Z_p = \\frac{b}{6h} [ y_p^2(3h - y_p) + (h-y_p)^3 ]$.\nLet's expand the terms inside the bracket:\n$$\n[y_p^2(3h-y_p)] + [(h-y_p)^3] = (3hy_p^2 - y_p^3) + (h^3 - 3h^2y_p + 3hy_p^2 - y_p^3)\n$$\n$$\n= h^3 - 3h^2y_p + 6hy_p^2 - 2y_p^3\n$$\nSubstitute $y_p = h(1 - 1/\\sqrt{2})$:\n$$\n= h^3 - 3h^2\\left(h\\left(1 - \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\right)\\right) + 6h\\left(h^2\\left(1 - \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\right)^2\\right) - 2\\left(h^3\\left(1 - \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\right)^3\\right)\n$$\n$$\n= h^3 \\left[ 1 - 3\\left(1 - \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\right) + 6\\left(1 - \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{2}} + \\frac{1}{2}\\right) - 2\\left(1 - \\frac{3}{\\sqrt{2}} + \\frac{3}{2} - \\frac{1}{2\\sqrt{2}}\\right) \\right]\n$$\n$$\n= h^3 \\left[ 1 - 3 + \\frac{3}{\\sqrt{2}} + 6\\left(\\frac{3}{2} - \\sqrt{2}\\right) - 2\\left(\\frac{5}{2} - \\frac{7}{2\\sqrt{2}}\\right) \\right]\n$$\n$$\n= h^3 \\left[ -2 + \\frac{3}{\\sqrt{2}} + 9 - 6\\sqrt{2} - 5 + \\frac{7}{\\sqrt{2}} \\right]\n$$\n$$\n= h^3 \\left[ (-2 + 9 - 5) + \\left(\\frac{3}{\\sqrt{2}} - 6\\sqrt{2} + \\frac{7}{\\sqrt{2}}\\right) \\right]\n$$\n$$\n= h^3 \\left[ 2 + \\left(\\frac{10}{\\sqrt{2}} - 6\\sqrt{2}\\right) \\right] = h^3 [ 2 + (5\\sqrt{2} - 6\\sqrt{2}) ] = h^3(2 - \\sqrt{2})\n$$\nFinally, substitute this result back into the expression for $Z_p$:\n$$\nZ_p = \\frac{b}{6h} [h^3(2 - \\sqrt{2})] = \\frac{bh^2}{6}(2 - \\sqrt{2})\n$$\nThe results for $y_p$ and $Z_p$ are exact analytical expressions in terms of $b$ and $h$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} h\\left(1 - \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}\\right) & \\frac{bh^2}{6}(2 - \\sqrt{2}) \\end{pmatrix}}\n$$", "id": "2670750"}, {"introduction": "Real-world structural members are often subjected to both bending moments and axial forces simultaneously.

It is scientifically sound, well-posed, and objective. A solution will now be derived from first principles.\n\n### Derivation of the Solution\n\nThe solution requires enforcing two equilibrium conditions on the fully plastic cross-section: axial force equilibrium and moment equilibrium. The rectangular cross-section has width $b$ and depth $h$. We place a coordinate system with its origin at the centroid, with the $z$-axis aligned with the depth, running from $z = -h/2$ (top fiber) to $z = +h/2$ (bottom fiber). A positive bending moment $M$ causes tension in the region $z > 0$. A positive axial force $N$ is tensile.\n\nThe combined effect of $M$ and $N$ causes the cross-section to become fully plastic. The stress is either $\\sigma_{y}$ (tension) or $-\\sigma_{y}$ (compression). The Plastic Neutral Axis (PNA) is the line where the stress changes sign. Due to the presence of a net axial force $N \\neq 0$, the PNA will be displaced from the centroid. Let the PNA be located at $z = z_{pna}$.\n\nFor a positive tensile force $N > 0$, the tensile area must be larger than the compressive area to provide a net tensile force. This means the PNA must shift into the region that would be purely compressive under bending alone, i.e., $z_{pna} < 0$. Let the shift distance from the centroid be $z_n > 0$, so that $z_{pna} = -z_n$.\n\nThe tensile region extends from $z = -z_n$ to $z = h/2$. Its area is $A_t = b(h/2 - (-z_n)) = b(h/2 + z_n)$.\nThe compressive region extends from $z = -h/2$ to $z = -z_n$. Its area is $A_c = b(-z_n - (-h/2)) = b(h/2 - z_n)$.\n\n**1. Axial Force Equilibrium:**\nThe net axial force $N$ must be balanced by the integrated stress.\n$$N = \\int_A \\sigma \\, dA = \\sigma_y A_t - \\sigma_y A_c$$\nSubstituting the expressions for $A_t$ and $A_c$:\n$$N = \\sigma_y [b(h/2 + z_n) - b(h/2 - z_n)] = \\sigma_y (b h/2 + b z_n - b h/2 + b z_n) = 2 \\sigma_y b z_n$$\nSolving for the PNA shift distance $z_n$:\n$$z_n = \\frac{N}{2 \\sigma_y b}$$\nThis expression relates the PNA shift to the applied axial force $N$. If $N$ is compressive ($N < 0$), $z_n$ becomes negative, indicating a shift in the opposite direction. This formulation is general.\n\n**2. Moment Equilibrium:**\nThe plastic moment capacity, $M_p(N)$, is the resultant moment of the stress distribution calculated about the centroidal axis ($z=0$).\n$$M_p(N) = \\int_A \\sigma \\cdot z \\, dA = \\int_{-h/2}^{-z_n} (-\\sigma_y) z b \\, dz + \\int_{-z_n}^{h/2} (+\\sigma_y) z b \\, dz$$\n$$M_p(N) = -\\sigma_y b \\left[\\frac{z^2}{2}\\right]_{-h/2}^{-z_n} + \\sigma_y b \\left[\\frac{z^2}{2}\\right]_{-z_n}^{h/2}$$\n$$M_p(N) = -\\frac{\\sigma_y b}{2} [(-z_n)^2 - (-h/2)^2] + \\frac{\\sigma_y b}{2} [(h/2)^2 - (-z_n)^2]$$\n$$M_p(N) = -\\frac{\\sigma_y b}{2} (z_n^2 - \\frac{h^2}{4}) + \\frac{\\sigma_y b}{2} (\\frac{h^2}{4} - z_n^2)$$\n$$M_p(N) = \\frac{\\sigma_y b}{2} (-z_n^2 + \\frac{h^2}{4} + \\frac{h^2}{4} - z_n^2) = \\frac{\\sigma_y b}{2} (\\frac{h^2}{2} - 2z_n^2)$$\n$$M_p(N) = \\sigma_y b \\left(\\frac{h^2}{4} - z_n^2\\right)$$\nThis gives the plastic moment capacity as a function of the PNA shift $z_n$.\n\nTo express $M_p(N)$ as a function of $N$, we substitute the expression for $z_n$:\n$$M_p(N) = \\sigma_y b \\left[\\frac{h^2}{4} - \\left(\\frac{N}{2 \\sigma_y b}\\right)^2\\right] = \\sigma_y b \\left(\\frac{h^2}{4} - \\frac{N^2}{4 \\sigma_y^2 b^2}\\right)$$\n$$M_p(N) = \\frac{\\sigma_y b h^2}{4} - \\frac{\\sigma_y b N^2}{4 \\sigma_y^2 b^2} = \\frac{\\sigma_y b h^2}{4} - \\frac{N^2}{4 \\sigma_y b}$$\nThe first term is the plastic moment capacity in the absence of axial force, $M_p(0) = \\frac{\\sigma_y b h^2}{4}$. Thus, the final expression is:\n$$M_p(N) = M_p(0) - \\frac{N^2}{4 \\sigma_y b}$$\n\n### Evaluation of Options\n\n**A. Keep the PNA at the centroid regardless of $N$ to preserve symmetry. The collapse moment is unaffected by $N$, i.e., $M_{p}(N)=M_{p}(0)$.**\nThis is fundamentally incorrect. If the PNA is at the centroid, the tensile and compressive blocks have equal area ($A_t = A_c$). The resultant axial force from the internal stress distribution would be $\\sigma_y(A_t - A_c) = 0$. This cannot be in equilibrium with an external non-zero axial force $N$. Thus, the premise violates axial force equilibrium.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**B. Shift the PNA by a distance $z_{n}$ from the centroid so that axial equilibrium $\\sigma_{y}\\,(A_{t}-A_{c})=N$ holds, where $A_{t}$ and $A_{c}$ are the areas of the tensile and compressive yielded blocks, respectively. Then evaluate the collapse moment by the first moment of the stress distribution about the centroid. For a rectangle this yields**\n**- $z_{n}=N/\\!\\left(2\\,\\sigma_{y}\\,b\\right)$,**\n**- $M_{p}(N)=\\sigma_{y}\\,b\\left(\\dfrac{h^{2}}{4}-z_{n}^{2}\\right)=\\dfrac{\\sigma_{y}\\,b\\,h^{2}}{4}-\\dfrac{N^{2}}{4\\,\\sigma_{y}\\,b}$.**\nThis option correctly states the principle of axial equilibrium $\\sigma_{y}\\,(A_{t}-A_{c})=N$. The derived expression for the PNA shift, $z_{n}=N/\\!\\left(2\\,\\sigma_{y}\\,b\\right)$, matches our derivation. The expression for the plastic moment capacity, $M_{p}(N)=\\sigma_{y}\\,b\\left(\\frac{h^{2}}{4}-z_{n}^{2}\\right)$, also matches our derivation. Finally, the substitution of $z_n$ to get $M_{p}(N)$ as a function of $N$, $\\frac{\\sigma_{y}\\,b\\,h^{2}}{4}-\\frac{N^{2}}{4\\,\\sigma_{y}\\,b}$, is also identical to our result. All parts of this option are consistent with the principles of plastic analysis.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**C. Choose the PNA so that $\\sigma_{y}\\,(A_{t}+A_{c})=N$ and compute the collapse moment as the sum of the block couples measured from the PNA, giving for a rectangle ...**\nThe proposed equilibrium condition $\\sigma_{y}\\,(A_{t}+A_{c})=N$ is incorrect. Since $A_t + A_c = A = bh$ (total area), this condition is $N = \\sigma_y A = N_p$, where $N_p$ is the plastic axial capacity. This describes a state of pure axial yielding with zero moment capacity, not a general case of combined loading. The correct equilibrium equation involves the difference of areas, not the sum. Furthermore, the resulting moment formula contains a positive sign for the $N$-dependent term, which would wrongly imply that axial force *increases* moment capacity.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. Use the elastic neutral axis shift $z_{n}=N/(E\\,A)$... and assume a linear interaction at collapse $M_{p}(N)=M_{p}(0)\\left(1-\\left|N\\right|/N_{p}\\right)$ with $N_{p}=\\sigma_{y}\\,A$.**\nThis option erroneously mixes concepts from elastic and plastic analysis. The shift of the PNA at plastic collapse is determined by the yield stress $\\sigma_y$ and has no dependence on the elastic Young's modulus $E$. The proposed linear interaction formula, while a common approximation for some cross-sections, is not exact for a rectangle. As derived, the correct interaction for a rectangle is parabolic: $M_p(N)/M_p(0) + (N/N_p)^2 = 1$.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2670701"}, {"introduction": "Having mastered the calculation of plastic moment capacity for a cross-section, we now apply this knowledge to predict the failure of an entire structure.

Therefore, the problem is deemed valid and a complete solution will be developed.\n\nThe solution proceeds in three parts as requested.\n\nPart 1: Determination of the fully plastic moment $M_{p}$.\nAt the fully plastic state, the entire cross-section has yielded. For a material that is elastic–perfectly plastic, the stress is everywhere equal to the yield stress, $\\sigma_{y}$, in magnitude. The plastic neutral axis (PNA) is defined as the axis where the stress changes sign. For equilibrium, the total axial force on the cross-section must be zero. This requires that the area in tension, $A_{t}$, equals the area in compression, $A_{c}$.\nFor a rectangular cross-section of width $b$ and depth $h$, the total area is $A = bh$. The condition $A_{t}=A_{c}$ implies that the PNA is located at the geometric centroid, i.e., at mid-depth $h/2$.\nThe cross-section is thus divided into two rectangular areas, each of size $b \\times (h/2)$. One area is under uniform tensile stress $\\sigma_{y}$, and the other is under uniform compressive stress $-\\sigma_{y}$.\nThe magnitude of the resultant force from each stress block is:\n$$F_t = F_c = \\sigma_{y} \\times A_{t} = \\sigma_{y} \\left( b \\frac{h}{2} \\right)$$\nThe centroid of the upper rectangular stress block is at a distance of $h/4$ above the PNA, and the centroid of the lower stress block is at a distance of $h/4$ below the PNA. The lever arm, $d$, between these two resultant forces is thus:\n$$d = \\frac{h}{4} + \\frac{h}{4} = \\frac{h}{2}$$\nThe fully plastic moment, $M_{p}$, is the couple formed by these two forces:\n$$M_{p} = F_t \\times d = \\left( \\sigma_{y} \\frac{bh}{2} \\right) \\left( \\frac{h}{2} \\right) = \\sigma_{y} \\frac{bh^2}{4}$$\nThis can also be expressed in terms of the plastic section modulus, $Z_{p} = \\frac{bh^2}{4}$, such that $M_{p} = \\sigma_{y} Z_{p}$. The shape factor for a rectangle is $S = Z_{p}/Z_{e} = (\\frac{bh^2}{4}) / (\\frac{bh^2}{6}) = 1.5$.\nUsing the given numerical values: $b=100\\,\\mathrm{mm} = 0.1\\,\\mathrm{m}$, $h=200\\,\\mathrm{mm} = 0.2\\,\\mathrm{m}$, and $\\sigma_{y}=250\\,\\mathrm{MPa}=250 \\times 10^6\\,\\mathrm{N/m^2}$.\n$$M_{p} = (250 \\times 10^6 \\,\\mathrm{N/m^2}) \\frac{(0.1\\,\\mathrm{m})(0.2\\,\\mathrm{m})^2}{4} = 250 \\times 10^6 \\times \\frac{0.1 \\times 0.04}{4} = 250 \\times 10^3\\,\\mathrm{N \\cdot m} = 250\\,\\mathrm{kN \\cdot m}$$\n\nPart 2: Application of the kinematic theorem.\nA propped cantilever is statically indeterminate to the first degree. The formation of a collapse mechanism requires one more plastic hinge than the degree of indeterminacy, so $1+1=2$ plastic hinges are needed. For a uniformly distributed load, one hinge forms at the fixed support (point A, $x=0$), where the elastic moment is maximum. The second hinge forms within the span (point C, at $x=x_0$) where there is a local maximum in the bending moment diagram at collapse.\nWe postulate a collapse mechanism with hinges at $x=0$ and $x=x_0$. Let the mechanism be characterized by a small virtual rotation $\\theta_A$ at the fixed support A. The beam segment AC rotates as a rigid body about A, and the segment CB rotates about the simple support B.\nThe downward deflection at the interior hinge C is $\\delta_C = x_0 \\theta_A$.\nThe rotation $\\phi$ of the segment CB about the simple support B is given by $\\phi = \\frac{\\delta_C}{L-x_0} = \\frac{x_0 \\theta_A}{L-x_0}$.\nThe total rotation at the interior hinge C, $\\theta_C$, is the sum of the rotations of the two segments meeting at C:\n$$\\theta_C = \\theta_A + \\phi = \\theta_A + \\frac{x_0 \\theta_A}{L-x_0} = \\theta_A \\left( 1 + \\frac{x_0}{L-x_0} \\right) = \\theta_A \\frac{L}{L-x_0}$$\nThe principle of virtual work states that at collapse, the rate of external work done by the applied loads equals the rate of internal energy dissipated at the plastic hinges. Let the virtual rotation rates be $\\dot{\\theta}_A$, $\\dot{\\phi}$, and $\\dot{\\theta}_C$.\nThe external work rate, $\\dot{W}_{ext}$, is due to the distributed load $w$.\n$$\\dot{W}_{ext} = \\int_0^L w \\dot{\\delta}(x) dx$$\nThe velocity field is $\\dot{\\delta}(x) = x \\dot{\\theta}_A$ for $0 \\le x \\le x_0$ and $\\dot{\\delta}(x) = (L-x)\\dot{\\phi} = (L-x)\\frac{x_0 \\dot{\\theta}_A}{L-x_0}$ for $x_0 \\le x \\le L$.\n$$\\dot{W}_{ext} = w \\dot{\\theta}_A \\left[ \\int_0^{x_0} x dx + \\int_{x_0}^L (L-x) \\frac{x_0}{L-x_0} dx \\right]$$\n$$\\dot{W}_{ext} = w \\dot{\\theta}_A \\left[ \\frac{x_0^2}{2} + \\frac{x_0}{L-x_0} \\left[ Lx - \\frac{x^2}{2} \\right]_{x_0}^L \\right] = w \\dot{\\theta}_A \\left[ \\frac{x_0^2}{2} + \\frac{x_0}{L-x_0} \\frac{(L-x_0)^2}{2} \\right]$$\n$$\\dot{W}_{ext} = w \\dot{\\theta}_A \\left[ \\frac{x_0^2}{2} + \\frac{x_0(L-x_0)}{2} \\right] = w \\dot{\\theta}_A \\frac{Lx_0}{2}$$\nThe internal dissipation rate, $\\dot{W}_{int}$, occurs at the plastic hinges:\n$$\\dot{W}_{int} = M_{p}|\\dot{\\theta}_A| + M_{p}|\\dot{\\theta}_C| = M_{p}\\dot{\\theta}_A + M_{p}\\left(\\dot{\\theta}_A\\frac{L}{L-x_0}\\right) = M_{p}\\dot{\\theta}_A \\left( 1 + \\frac{L}{L-x_0} \\right) = M_{p}\\dot{\\theta}_A \\frac{2L-x_0}{L-x_0}$$\n\nPart 3: Determination of the collapse load $w_c$.\nEquating the external work rate and internal dissipation rate, $\\dot{W}_{ext} = \\dot{W}_{int}$:\n$$w \\dot{\\theta}_A \\frac{Lx_0}{2} = M_{p}\\dot{\\theta}_A \\frac{2L-x_0}{L-x_0}$$\nSolving for $w$ as a function of the hinge location $x_0$:\n$$w(x_0) = \\frac{2 M_p}{L} \\frac{2L-x_0}{x_0(L-x_0)}$$\nAccording to the kinematic (upper-bound) theorem, this expression is an upper bound on the true collapse load. The best upper bound, which is the actual collapse load $w_c$, is found by minimizing $w(x_0)$ with respect to $x_0$. We set the derivative $\\frac{dw}{dx_0}$ to zero. This is equivalent to minimizing the function $f(x_0) = \\frac{2L-x_0}{Lx_0-x_0^2}$.\n$$\\frac{df}{dx_0} = \\frac{(-1)(Lx_0 - x_0^2) - (2L-x_0)(L-2x_0)}{(Lx_0-x_0^2)^2} = 0$$\nThe numerator must be zero:\n$$-Lx_0 + x_0^2 - (2L^2 - 4Lx_0 - Lx_0 + 2x_0^2) = 0$$\n$$-Lx_0 + x_0^2 - 2L^2 + 5Lx_0 - 2x_0^2 = 0$$\n$$-x_0^2 + 4Lx_0 - 2L^2 = 0 \\quad \\implies \\quad x_0^2 - 4Lx_0 + 2L^2 = 0$$\nSolving this quadratic equation for $x_0$:\n$$x_0 = \\frac{4L \\pm \\sqrt{16L^2 - 4(1)(2L^2)}}{2} = \\frac{4L \\pm \\sqrt{8L^2}}{2} = \\frac{4L \\pm 2\\sqrt{2}L}{2} = (2 \\pm \\sqrt{2})L$$\nSince the hinge must lie within the span, $0 < x_0 < L$. The solution $x_0 = (2+\\sqrt{2})L \\approx 3.414L$ is extraneous. The valid location is:\n$$x_0 = (2-\\sqrt{2})L \\approx 0.586L$$\nThe collapse load $w_c$ is found by substituting this value of $x_0$ back into the expression for $w(x_0)$:\n$$w_c = \\frac{2 M_p}{L} \\frac{2L - (2-\\sqrt{2})L}{(2-\\sqrt{2})L(L-(2-\\sqrt{2})L)} = \\frac{2 M_p}{L} \\frac{\\sqrt{2}L}{(2-\\sqrt{2})L(\\sqrt{2}-1)L} = \\frac{2\\sqrt{2}M_p}{L^2(2\\sqrt{2}-2-2+\\sqrt{2})} = \\frac{2\\sqrt{2}M_p}{L^2(3\\sqrt{2}-4)}$$\nRationalizing the denominator:\n$$w_c = \\frac{2\\sqrt{2}M_p}{L^2(3\\sqrt{2}-4)} \\times \\frac{3\\sqrt{2}+4}{3\\sqrt{2}+4} = \\frac{M_p(12+8\\sqrt{2})}{L^2((3\\sqrt{2})^2-4^2)} = \\frac{M_p(12+8\\sqrt{2})}{L^2(18-16)} = \\frac{M_p(12+8\\sqrt{2})}{2L^2} = (6+4\\sqrt{2})\\frac{M_p}{L^2}$$\nNow, we substitute the numerical values: $M_p = 250\\,\\mathrm{kN \\cdot m}$ and $L=6\\,\\mathrm{m}$.\n$$w_c = (6+4\\sqrt{2}) \\frac{250\\,\\mathrm{kN \\cdot m}}{(6\\,\\mathrm{m})^2} = (6+4\\sqrt{2}) \\frac{250}{36} \\,\\mathrm{kN/m}$$\n$$w_c \\approx (11.65685) \\times (6.94444) \\,\\mathrm{kN/m} \\approx 80.95037 \\,\\mathrm{kN/m}$$\nRounding to three significant figures, the plastic collapse load is $81.0\\,\\mathrm{kN/m}$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{81.0}$$", "id": "2670662"}]}
