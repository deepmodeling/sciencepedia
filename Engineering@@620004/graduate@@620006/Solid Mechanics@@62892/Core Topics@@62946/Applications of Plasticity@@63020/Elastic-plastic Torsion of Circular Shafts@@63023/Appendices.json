It is verifiable through standard principles of solid mechanics.\n\nStep 3: Verdict.\nThe problem is valid. A solution will be derived.\n\nThe fundamental relationship between the applied torque $T$ and the shear stress distribution $\\tau(r)$ over a circular cross-section of radius $R$ is given by the integral of the moment due to shear stress over the area $A$. For an annular element of area $dA = 2\\pi r \\, dr$ at radius $r$, the total torque is:\n$$\nT = \\int_{A} r \\tau(r) \\, dA = \\int_{0}^{R} r \\tau(r) (2\\pi r \\, dr) = 2\\pi \\int_{0}^{R} r^2 \\tau(r) \\, dr\n$$\nThis is the required starting point.\n\nFirst, we determine the elastic limit torque, which we denote as $T_{e}$. In the elastic regime, the shear stress is proportional to the radius, $\\tau_{e}(r) = Cr$ for some constant $C$. Yielding initiates when the maximum shear stress at the outer surface ($r=R$) reaches the yield stress $\\tau_{y}$.\n$$\n\\tau_{e}(R) = CR = \\tau_{y} \\implies C = \\frac{\\tau_{y}}{R}\n$$\nThus, the stress distribution at the onset of yielding is:\n$$\n\\tau_{e}(r) = \\frac{\\tau_{y}}{R} r\n$$\nThe elastic limit torque $T_{e}$ is the torque corresponding to this stress state:\n$$\nT_{e} = 2\\pi \\int_{0}^{R} r^2 \\left(\\frac{\\tau_{y}}{R} r\\right) dr = \\frac{2\\pi\\tau_{y}}{R} \\int_{0}^{R} r^3 dr\n$$\nEvaluating the integral gives:\n$$\nT_{e} = \\frac{2\\pi\\tau_{y}}{R} \\left[ \\frac{r^4}{4} \\right]_{0}^{R} = \\frac{2\\pi\\tau_{y}}{R} \\frac{R^4}{4} = \\frac{\\pi}{2} \\tau_{y} R^3\n$$\n\nNext, we determine the fully plastic torque, $T_{p}$. In this state, the material has yielded throughout the entire cross-section. Therefore, the shear stress is equal to the yield stress $\\tau_{y}$ for all $r > 0$. The stress distribution is:\n$$\n\\tau_{p}(r) = \\tau_{y}\n$$\nThe fully plastic torque $T_{p}$ is calculated by integrating with this stress distribution:\n$$\nT_{p} = 2\\pi \\int_{0}^{R} r^2 \\tau_{y} \\, dr = 2\\pi\\tau_{y} \\int_{0}^{R} r^2 dr\n$$\nEvaluating this integral yields:\n$$\nT_{p} = 2\\pi\\tau_{y} \\left[ \\frac{r^3}{3} \\right]_{0}^{R} = \\frac{2\\pi}{3} \\tau_{y} R^3\n$$\n\nNow we use these expressions to find the radii $R_{p}$ and $R_{e}$ for a given required torque capacity $T^{\\star}$.\n\nFor the fully plastic design, the minimum radius $R_{p}$ must provide a fully plastic torque capacity of $T^{\\star}$. We set $T_{p} = T^{\\star}$ and $R = R_{p}$:\n$$\nT^{\\star} = \\frac{2\\pi}{3} \\tau_{y} R_{p}^3\n$$\nSolving for $R_{p}$:\n$$\nR_{p}^3 = \\frac{3 T^{\\star}}{2\\pi \\tau_{y}} \\implies R_{p} = \\left(\\frac{3 T^{\\star}}{2\\pi\\tau_{y}}\\right)^{1/3}\n$$\n\nFor the elastic design, the minimum radius $R_{e}$ must carry the same torque $T^{\\star}$ without the maximum shear stress exceeding $\\tau_{y}$. An elastic shaft of radius $R_{e}$ carrying a torque $T^{\\star}$ has a maximum shear stress at its outer surface. Using the formula for the elastic limit torque $T_e$ with $R=R_e$, we know that the torque corresponding to $\\tau_{max}=\\tau_y$ is $T_e = \\frac{\\pi}{2} \\tau_{y} R_e^3$. For a safe elastic design carrying torque $T^{\\star}$, we must have $T^{\\star} \\leq T_e$.

Second, the torque $T$ for the partially plastic case is formulated. Third, the ratio $T/T_{e}$ is formed and used to solve for the required quantities.\n\nFirst, we determine the elastic limit torque, $T_{e}$. This is the torque at which yielding first occurs. In a fully elastic shaft, the shear stress distribution is linear with radius, given by $\\tau(r) = G \\gamma(r) = G r \\theta'$. The maximum shear stress occurs at the outer surface, $r=R$. Yielding begins when this maximum stress reaches the yield stress, $\\tau(R) = \\tau_{y}$. This gives the twist per unit length at yield as $G R \\theta'_{e} = \\tau_{y}$, or $\\theta'_{e} = \\frac{\\tau_{y}}{GR}$. The stress distribution at the elastic limit is thus $\\tau(r) = \\tau_{y} \\frac{r}{R}$. The corresponding torque $T_{e}$ is found by integrating the stress distribution over the cross-sectional area $A$. For a circular cross-section, the area element is $\\mathrm{d}A = 2\\pi r \\, \\mathrm{d}r$.\n\n$$T_{e} = \\int_{A} \\tau(r) \\, r \\, \\mathrm{d}A = \\int_{0}^{R} \\left(\\tau_{y} \\frac{r}{R}\\right) r (2\\pi r \\, \\mathrm{d}r)$$\n$$T_{e} = \\frac{2\\pi \\tau_{y}}{R} \\int_{0}^{R} r^3 \\, \\mathrm{d}r = \\frac{2\\pi \\tau_{y}}{R} \\left[ \\frac{r^4}{4} \\right]_{0}^{R} = \\frac{2\\pi \\tau_{y} R^4}{4R} = \\frac{\\pi R^3 \\tau_{y}}{2}$$\n\nNext, we consider the partially plastic case where the applied torque $T > T_{e}$. The cross-section consists of an elastic core of radius $c$ ($0 \\le r \\le c$) and a plastic annulus ($c < r \\le R$).\nAt the interface $r=c$, the material is at the point of yielding, so the shear stress is $\\tau(c) = \\tau_{y}$.\nIn the elastic core ($0 \\le r \\le c$), the stress distribution is linear: $\\tau(r) = \\tau_{y} \\frac{r}{c}$.\nIn the plastic annulus ($c < r \\le R$), the material has yielded, and for a perfectly plastic material, the stress is constant at the yield value: $\\tau(r) = \\tau_{y}$.\n\nThe total torque $T$ is the sum of the torque carried by the elastic core ($T_{core}$) and the plastic annulus ($T_{annulus}$).\n\n$$T = T_{core} + T_{annulus} = \\int_{0}^{c} \\tau(r) \\, r \\, (2\\pi r \\, \\mathrm{d}r) + \\int_{c}^{R} \\tau(r) \\, r \\, (2\\pi r \\, \\mathrm{d}r)$$\n$$T = \\int_{0}^{c} \\left(\\tau_{y} \\frac{r}{c}\\right) r (2\\pi r \\, \\mathrm{d}r) + \\int_{c}^{R} \\tau_{y} \\, r \\, (2\\pi r \\, \\mathrm{d}r)$$\n$$T = \\frac{2\\pi \\tau_{y}}{c} \\int_{0}^{c} r^3 \\, \\mathrm{d}r + 2\\pi \\tau_{y} \\int_{c}^{R} r^2 \\, \\mathrm{d}r$$\n$$T = \\frac{2\\pi \\tau_{y}}{c} \\left[ \\frac{r^4}{4} \\right]_{0}^{c} + 2\\pi \\tau_{y} \\left[ \\frac{r^3}{3} \\right]_{c}^{R}$$\n$$T = \\frac{2\\pi \\tau_{y} c^3}{4} + \\frac{2\\pi \\tau_{y}}{3} (R^3 - c^3) = \\frac{\\pi \\tau_{y} c^3}{2} + \\frac{2\\pi \\tau_{y} R^3}{3} - \\frac{2\\pi \\tau_{y} c^3}{3}$$\n$$T = \\frac{2\\pi \\tau_{y} R^3}{3} - \\left(\\frac{2}{3} - \\frac{1}{2}\\right) \\pi \\tau_{y} c^3 = \\frac{2\\pi \\tau_{y} R^3}{3} - \\frac{\\pi \\tau_{y} c^3}{6}$$\nFactoring out the term $\\frac{2\\pi \\tau_{y} R^3}{3}$ yields:\n$$T = \\frac{2\\pi \\tau_{y} R^3}{3} \\left(1 - \\frac{c^3}{4R^3}\\right)$$\n\nNow, we form the ratio $T/T_{e}$ to obtain the required closed-form relation linking the torque ratio to the dimensionless elastic core radius $c/R$.\n\n$$\\frac{T}{T_{e}} = \\frac{\\frac{2\\pi \\tau_{y} R^3}{3} \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{4}\\left(\\frac{c}{R}\\right)^3\\right)}{\\frac{\\pi R^3 \\tau_{y}}{2}} = \\frac{2/3}{1/2} \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{4}\\left(\\frac{c}{R}\\right)^3\\right)$$\n$$\\frac{T}{T_{e}} = \\frac{4}{3} \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{4}\\left(\\frac{c}{R}\\right)^3\\right)$$\nThis is the derived relation.

The discretized stress in the $i$-th annulus is:\n$$\\tau_i(\\kappa) = \\min\\big(G_i \\kappa r_i, \\tau_{y,i}\\big)$$\nThe total torque is then approximated by the summation:\n$$T_{\\text{num}}(\\kappa) = 2\\pi \\sum_{i=0}^{N-1} \\tau_i(\\kappa) r_i^2 \\Delta r$$\nOur objective reduces to solving the nonlinear algebraic equation for $\\kappa$:\n$$f(\\kappa) = T_{\\text{num}}(\\kappa) - T_{\\mathrm{app}} = 0$$\nThe function $T_{\\text{num}}(\\kappa)$ is a monotonically non-decreasing function of $\\kappa$, since $\\tau_i(\\kappa)$ is a monotonically non-decreasing function for each $i$. This property makes the root-finding problem well-suited for the bisection method. First, we must check for feasibility. A solution for $\\kappa$ exists only if the applied torque $T_{\\mathrm{app}}$ does not exceed the fully plastic torque, $T_{\\mathrm{fp}}$. The fully plastic torque corresponds to the state where the shear stress equals the yield stress everywhere in the cross-section, $\\tau(r) = \\tau_y(r)$. Its discretized form is:\n$$T_{\\mathrm{fp}} = 2\\pi \\sum_{i=0}^{N-1} \\tau_{y,i} r_i^2 \\Delta r$$\nIf $T_{\\mathrm{app}} > T_{\\mathrm{fp}}$, no solution exists within the framework of rate-independent perfect plasticity. All test cases provided are assumed to be feasible.\n\nThe bisection algorithm requires finding a bracket $[\\kappa_a, \\kappa_b]$ such that $f(\\kappa_a)$ and $f(\\kappa_b)$ have opposite signs.\n1. A natural lower bound is $\\kappa_a = 0$. For this value, $T_{\\text{num}}(0) = 0$, so $f(0) = -T_{\\mathrm{app}}$. Since $T_{\\mathrm{app}} \\ge 0$, we have $f(0) \\le 0$.\n2. An upper bound $\\kappa_b$ must be found such that $f(\\kappa_b) > 0$, which means $T_{\\text{num}}(\\kappa_b) > T_{\\mathrm{app}}$. As long as $T_{\\mathrm{app}} < T_{\\mathrm{fp}}$, such a $\\kappa_b$ can always be found. A simple strategy is to start with a guestimate for $\\kappa_b$ and increase it (e.g., by doubling) until the condition is met.\n3. Once the bracket is established, the bisection method iteratively halves the interval while keeping the root bracketed, converging to the solution for $\\kappa$ with a specified tolerance.\n\nThis general algorithm is applied to each test case.\n\n**Case A Analysis**: $a = 0\\,\\mathrm{m}$, $R = 0.02\\,\\mathrm{m}$, $G(r) = 28\\times 10^{9} + 8\\times 10^{9}\\,\\frac{r}{R}\\ \\mathrm{Pa}$, $\\tau_{y}(r) = 200\\times 10^{6}\\ \\mathrm{Pa}$, $T_{\\mathrm{app}} = 500\\,\\mathrm{N\\cdot m}$.\nThis is a solid shaft with linearly graded shear modulus. A preliminary check can determine if yielding occurs. If the response is purely elastic, $\\tau(r) = G(r)\\kappa r$. The torque is $T_{el}(\\kappa) = \\kappa \\cdot 2\\pi \\int_0^R G(r) r^3 dr$. Evaluating this integral gives the torsional rigidity. For the given parameters, a fully elastic response would require $\\kappa \\approx 0.0578\\,\\mathrm{rad/m}$. At this twist, the maximum shear stress occurs at $r=R$ and is $\\tau_{\\max} = G(R)\\kappa R \\approx 41.6\\,\\mathrm{MPa}$, which is well below the yield stress $\\tau_y = 200\\,\\mathrm{MPa}$. Thus, the shaft remains entirely elastic, and the numerical solver should converge to the purely elastic solution.\n\n**Case B Analysis**: $a = 0.005\\,\\mathrm{m}$, $R = 0.02\\,\\mathrm{m}$, $r_c = 0.012\\,\\mathrm{m}$, piecewise constant $G(r)$, $\\tau_y = 120\\,\\mathrm{MPa}$, $T_{\\mathrm{app}} = 1600\\,\\mathrm{N\\cdot m}$.\nThis is a hollow composite shaft. The fully plastic torque is $T_{\\mathrm{fp}} \\approx 1979\\,\\mathrm{N\\cdot m}$. The torque at which first yield occurs (at $r=R$) is $T_{yield} \\approx 1448\\,\\mathrm{N\\cdot m}$. Since $T_{yield} < T_{\\mathrm{app}} < T_{\\mathrm{fp}}$, the shaft is partially yielded. An analytical solution is cumbersome, validating the necessity of the numerical approach.\n\n**Case C Analysis**: $a = 0\\,\\mathrm{m}$, $R = 0.02\\,\\mathrm{m}$, $G=30\\,\\mathrm{GPa}$, $\\tau_y=100\\,\\mathrm{MPa}$, $T_{\\mathrm{app}}=1600\\,\\mathrm{N\\cdot m}$.\nThis is a solid shaft with uniform properties. The fully plastic torque is $T_{\\mathrm{fp}} = 2\\pi\\tau_y R^3 / 3 \\approx 1675.5\\,\\mathrm{N\\cdot m}$. The applied torque $T_{\\mathrm{app}}=1600\\,\\mathrm{N\\cdot m}$ is approximately $95.5\\%$ of $T_{\\mathrm{fp}}$. This indicates the shaft is heavily plastic, with only a small elastic core. An analytical solution for this classic problem relates the torque to the radius of the elastic core, $r_{el}$: $T = T_{\\mathrm{fp}} - (\\pi/6)\\tau_y r_{el}^3$. Solving for $r_{el}$ yields $r_{el} \\approx 0.0113\\,\\mathrm{m}$. The twist is then $\\kappa = \\tau_y/(G r_{el}) \\approx 0.2949\\,\\mathrm{rad/m}$. The numerical method is expected to yield a result very close to this analytical value.\n\nThe numerical implementation will now follow this validated procedure.", "answer": "```python\n# The complete and runnable Python 3 code goes here.\n# Imports must adhere to the specified execution environment.\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy.optimize import bisect\n\ndef solve_for_kappa(a, R, N, G_func, tau_y_func, T_app):\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves for the twist per unit length kappa for a given shaft configuration and torque.\n    \n    Args:\n        a (float): Inner radius (m).\n        R (float): Outer radius (m).\n        N (int): Number of discretization annuli.\n        G_func (callable): Function G(r, R) for shear modulus (Pa).\n        tau_y_func (callable or float): Function tau_y(r, R) or constant for yield stress (Pa).\n        T_app (float): Applied torque (N*m).\n        \n    Returns:\n        float: The calculated twist per unit length kappa (rad/m).\n    \"\"\"\n    delta_r = (R - a) / N\n    # Midpoint radii of the N annuli\n    r = a + (np.arange(N) + 0.5) * delta_r\n\n    # Evaluate material properties at midpoints\n    G_vals = G_func(r, R)\n    \n    if callable(tau_y_func):\n        tau_y_vals = tau_y_func(r, R)\n    else:  # Handle constant yield stress\n        tau_y_vals = np.full_like(r, tau_y_func)\n\n    # Pre-calculate for efficiency\n    r_sq_delta_r = r**2 * delta_r\n\n    def torque_function(kappa):\n        \"\"\"Calculates the total torque for a given kappa.\"\"\"\n        if kappa  0:\n            return -torque_function(-kappa) # Assume symmetric response for negative kappa\n        \n        # Stress at each annulus based on elastic-perfectly plastic model\n        tau_elastic = G_vals * kappa * r\n        tau = np.minimum(tau_elastic, tau_y_vals)\n        \n        # Total torque from numerical integration\n        T_num = 2 * np.pi * np.sum(tau * r_sq_delta_r)\n        return T_num\n\n    # Feasibility check against fully plastic torque\n    T_fp = 2 * np.pi * np.sum(tau_y_vals * r_sq_delta_r)\n    if T_app > T_fp * (1 + 1e-9): # Add tolerance for numerical precision\n        # Problem statement implies feasible cases; this is for robustness.\n        return np.nan\n\n    # Objective function for the root-finder: f(kappa) = T(kappa) - T_app = 0\n    def objective_func(kappa):\n        return torque_function(kappa) - T_app\n\n    # Bisection method to find the root kappa\n    kappa_low = 0.0\n    \n    # Establish a search bracket [kappa_low, kappa_high]\n    # T(kappa) is monotonic, so is objective_func\n    kappa_high = 0.1  # Initial guess for the upper bound\n    # Ensure T(kappa_high) > T_app\n    while objective_func(kappa_high)  0:\n        if kappa_high > 1e6: # Safety break to prevent infinite loop\n            # This could happen if T_app is very close to or greater than T_fp\n            # and numerical precision issues arise.\n            return np.nan \n        kappa_high *= 2.0\n        \n    # Find the root using SciPy's bisection solver\n    try:\n        kappa_sol = bisect(objective_func, kappa_low, kappa_high, xtol=1e-12, rtol=1e-12)\n    except ValueError:\n        # This can happen if the bracket is not valid, e.g., if T_app is very close to T_fp\n        # and precision issues make objective_func(kappa_high)  0.\n        # This indicates a very high kappa.
