The plate is subjected to a uniform remote tensile stress $\\sigma$ acting normal to the crack plane.

No numerical evaluation is required.", "solution": "The problem posed is a classical exercise in Linear Elastic Fracture Mechanics (LEFM) and is scientifically valid, well-posed, and objective. It requests the derivation of the Griffith critical stress for an infinite plate with a central crack, starting from energy principles. I will now provide the rigorous derivation.\n\nThe total potential energy of the system, $\\Pi$, is the sum of the stored elastic strain energy, $U_{elastic}$, and the energy of the free surfaces, $U_{surface}$, minus the work done by external forces, $W_{ext}$.\n$$\n\\Pi = U_{elastic} - W_{ext} + U_{surface}\n$$\nThe mechanical potential energy is defined as $\\Pi_{mech} = U_{elastic} - W_{ext}$. Thus, $\\Pi = \\Pi_{mech} + U_{surface}$. For the given problem of a remotely loaded plate under \"dead loading,\" the external stress $\\sigma$ remains constant during crack extension. For a linear elastic system under constant load, the work done is twice the stored strain energy, $W_{ext} = 2 U_{elastic}$. Therefore, the mechanical potential energy is $\\Pi_{mech} = U_{elastic} - 2 U_{elastic} = -U_{elastic}$.\n\nThe energy release rate, $G$, is defined as the rate of decrease of the mechanical potential energy per unit increase in crack area, $A$. For a through-thickness crack of length $2a$ in a plate of unit thickness, the crack area is $A = 2a \\times 1 = 2a$. Consequently, an infinitesimal change in crack area is $dA = 2da$. The definition of $G$ is:\n$$\nG = -\\frac{d\\Pi_{mech}}{dA} = -\\frac{1}{2}\\frac{d\\Pi_{mech}}{da}\n$$\nTo evaluate this derivative, we require the dependence of $\\Pi_{mech}$ on the crack half-length $a$. We consider the change in mechanical potential energy, $\\Delta \\Pi_{mech}$, when a crack of length $2a$ is introduced into a previously uncracked plate. This change is equal to the negative of the change in strain energy, $\\Delta U_{elastic}$.\n$$\n\\Delta \\Pi_{mech}(a) = - \\Delta U_{elastic}(a)\n$$\nA standard and fundamental result in LEFM, derivable from the solution for stresses and displacements around a crack, gives the increase in elastic strain energy stored in an infinite plate of unit thickness due to the introduction of a central crack of length $2a$:\n$$\n\\Delta U_{elastic}(a) = \\frac{\\pi \\sigma^2 a^2}{E'}\n$$\nwhere $\\sigma$ is the remote tensile stress and $E'$ is the reduced modulus. The total mechanical potential energy of the cracked plate can be written as $\\Pi_{mech}(a) = \\Pi_{mech}(0) + \\Delta \\Pi_{mech}(a)$, where $\\Pi_{mech}(0)$ is the energy of the uncracked plate, a constant with respect to $a$.\n$$\n\\Pi_{mech}(a) = \\text{constant} - \\frac{\\pi \\sigma^2 a^2}{E'}\n$$\nWe can now calculate the energy release rate $G$.\n$$\n\\frac{d\\Pi_{mech}}{da} = \\frac{d}{da}\\left(-\\frac{\\pi \\sigma^2 a^2}{E'}\\right) = -\\frac{2\\pi \\sigma^2 a}{E'}\n$$\nSubstituting this into the definition of $G$:\n$$\nG(\\sigma, a) = -\\frac{1}{2} \\left( -\\frac{2\\pi \\sigma^2 a}{E'} \\right) = \\frac{\\pi \\sigma^2 a}{E'}\n$$\nThis is the required expression for the energy release rate.\n\nThe second task is to find the Griffith instability condition. Crack propagation becomes energetically favorable when the energy released by the mechanical system during crack extension is sufficient to supply the energy required to create the new crack surfaces. The resistance to fracture, $R$, is the energy consumed per unit area of crack extension. For the ideal brittle solid considered by Griffith, this is solely the surface energy.\nThe surface energy, $U_{surface}$, is created on two new fracture surfaces. For a crack of length $2a$ and unit thickness, the total area of these two surfaces is $2 \\times (2a \\times 1) = 4a$. Given that $\\gamma_s$ is the surface energy per unit area of a single free surface, the total surface energy is:\n$$\nU_{surface}(a) = 4a\\gamma_s\n$$\nThe fracture resistance $R$ is the rate of change of this surface energy with respect to crack area $A = 2a$:\n$$\nR = \\frac{dU_{surface}}{dA} = \\frac{d(4a\\gamma_s)}{d(2a)} = \\frac{4\\gamma_s da}{2da} = 2\\gamma_s\n$$\nThis critical value is denoted $G_c$, the fracture toughness of the material. So, $G_c = 2\\gamma_s$.\n\nThe instability condition is met when the energy release rate equals or exceeds the fracture resistance: $G \\ge G_c$. The critical condition for the onset of unstable fracture occurs at $G = G_c$, when the remote stress reaches a critical value $\\sigma_c$.\n$$\n\\frac{\\pi \\sigma_c^2 a}{E'} = 2\\gamma_s\n$$\nSolving this equation for the critical stress, $\\sigma_c$, yields the Griffith criterion:\n$$\n\\sigma_c^2 = \\frac{2 E' \\gamma_s}{\\pi a}\n$$\n$$\n\\sigma_c(a, E', \\gamma_s) = \\sqrt{\\frac{2 E' \\gamma_s}{\\pi a}}\n$$\nThis expression represents the critical remote tensile stress required to propagate a pre-existing crack of length $2a$.

Thus, this condition is always satisfied for any crack length $a \\in [0, L]$. This implies that any equilibrium point found will be stable, and any crack growth that occurs will be stable.\n\nQuasi-static crack growth is possible for a crack of length $a$ if the energy release rate is at least equal to the fracture resistance. This is the condition for a net driving force to exist, or to be in equilibrium. This can also be derived by requiring that any infinitesimal crack growth $da > 0$ does not increase the total potential energy, i.e., $d\\Pi_{\\text{total}} \\le 0$. This leads to $B(-G(a) + G_c(a))da \\le 0$, which implies $G(a) \\ge G_c(a)$.\n\nThe set of crack lengths for which stable quasi-static growth can occur is therefore the set of all $a$ for which $G(a) \\ge G_c(a)$.

We can divide by it without changing the inequality direction:\n$$\na \\le \\frac{G_0 - G_{c0}}{r + \\frac{G_0}{L}}\n$$\nSimplifying the expression on the right-hand side:\n$$\na \\le \\frac{L(G_0 - G_{c0})}{rL + G_0}\n$$\nThe right-hand side defines the arrest point, which we may call $a_{\\text{eq}}$. Any crack with an initial length $a_0 < a_{\\text{eq}}$ will grow because $G(a_0) > G_c(a_0)$. The growth is stable and proceeds until the crack length reaches $a_{\\text{eq}}$, at which point $G(a_{\\text{eq}}) = G_c(a_{\\text{eq}})$ and growth arrests.\n\nThe problem asks for the closed interval $[a_{\\min}, a_{\\max}]$ of crack lengths for which stable growth occurs. Crack length must be non-negative, so $a \\ge 0$. The condition for possible growth is $a \\le a_{\\text{eq}}$. The union of these conditions gives the interval $0 \\le a \\le a_{\\text{eq}}$.\nThus, we identify the endpoints of the interval as:\n$a_{\\min} = 0$\n$a_{\\max} = \\frac{L(G_0 - G_{c0})}{rL + G_0}$\n\nThe problem states that the arrest point lies strictly within $[0, L]$. We can verify that $a_{\\max} > 0$ because $L>0$, $G_0 > G_{c0}$, and the denominator is positive. We can also verify that $a_{\\max} < L$:\n$$\n\\frac{L(G_0 - G_{c0})}{G_0 + rL} < L \\iff \\frac{G_0 - G_{c0}}{G_0 + rL} < 1 \\iff G_0 - G_{c0} < G_0 + rL \\iff -G_{c0} < rL\n$$\nThis last inequality is true because $G_{c0} > 0$ and $rL > 0$. Thus, the interval is physically valid and lies within the given domain for $a$.\n\nThe set of crack lengths for which quasi-static growth is stable is the interval $[0, a_{\\max}]$.

It asks for the derivation and implementation of the Virtual Crack Closure Technique (VCCT) for a two-dimensional crack problem. The problem is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and provides all necessary information for a unique solution. We shall proceed with the derivation from first principles as required.\n\nThe energy release rate, denoted by $G$, is a fundamental concept in fracture mechanics. It represents the amount of energy dissipated per unit area of new crack surface created. Formally, it is defined as the negative rate of change of the total potential energy $\\Pi$ of the system with respect to the crack area $A$. For a finite crack extension creating a new area $\\Delta A$, this is expressed as:\n$$\nG = -\\frac{\\Delta \\Pi}{\\Delta A}\n$$\nThe total potential energy $\\Pi$ of an elastic body is the sum of the internal strain energy $U$ and the potential energy of the external loads, which is the negative of the work done by the external forces, $W_{\\text{ext}}$. Thus, $\\Pi = U - W_{\\text{ext}}$.\n\nThe Virtual Crack Closure Technique (VCCT), as stated in the problem, provides a method to calculate the energy released, $\\Delta \\Pi_{\\text{released}} = -\\Delta \\Pi$, by equating it to the mechanical work required to close the newly formed crack faces. Let us consider the process in two steps.\n\nStep 1: The crack extends by a small amount $\\Delta a$. The original crack tip is at position $x$. After extension, the tip is at $x + \\Delta a$. This extension creates new crack surfaces over a length $\\Delta a$. The energy released during this process is $\\Delta \\Pi_{\\text{released}}$.\n\nStep 2: We imagine a virtual process where we close these newly formed crack surfaces. The work done on the system to perform this closure, $W_{\\text{closure}}$, must be equal to the energy that was released when the surfaces were created. This is the core principle of VCCT:\n$$\n\\Delta \\Pi_{\\text{released}} = W_{\\text{closure}}\n$$\nWe need to formalize $W_{\\text{closure}}$. The work is done by forces acting over displacements. The VCCT relies on a key assumption for small crack extensions: the state of stress and displacement around the crack tip does not change significantly. Therefore, we can approximate:\n- The forces required to pull the newly formed crack faces back together are equal to the nodal forces that were holding the material together at the crack tip *before* the extension. These are given as $F_x^{\\mathrm{ahead}}$ and $F_y^{\\mathrm{ahead}}$.\n- The relative displacements that must be closed are the opening and sliding displacements between the nodes on the new crack faces *after* the crack has extended. These are given as $\\delta_x^{\\mathrm{behind}}$ and $\\delta_y^{\\mathrm{behind}}$.\n\nUnder the assumption of linear elasticity, the relationship between force and displacement during the closure process is linear. The work done by a force that increases linearly from $0$ to a final value $F$ over a displacement $\\delta$ is not simply $F \\delta$, but rather the area under the force-displacement curve, which is $\\frac{1}{2}F\\delta$. Therefore, the work required to close the crack is:\n$$\nW_{\\text{closure}} = W_x + W_y = \\frac{1}{2} F_x^{\\mathrm{ahead}} \\delta_x^{\\mathrm{behind}} + \\frac{1}{2} F_y^{\\mathrm{ahead}} \\delta_y^{\\mathrm{behind}}\n$$\nwhere $W_x$ and $W_y$ are the work components associated with the tangential (Mode II) and normal (Mode I) directions, respectively.\n\nThe problem introduces a contact consistency condition: only positive work contributes to the energy release. This is physically motivated by the fact that crack surface interpenetration (a negative displacement for a positive closing force) would not require work; in a real scenario, contact constraints would prevent this. We formalize this by taking only the positive contributions to the work. Let $W_{x,\\text{raw}} = F_x^{\\mathrm{ahead}} \\delta_x^{\\mathrm{behind}}$ and $W_{y,\\text{raw}} = F_y^{\\mathrm{ahead}} \\delta_y^{\\mathrm{behind}}$. The effective work is:\n$$\nW_{\\text{closure}} = \\frac{1}{2} \\left[ \\max(0, W_{x,\\text{raw}}) + \\max(0, W_{y,\\text{raw}}) \\right]\n$$\nNow we can express the energy release rate $G$. The new crack area created is the product of the crack extension length $\\Delta a$ and the out-of-plane thickness $b$.\n$$\n\\Delta A = b \\Delta a\n$$\nSubstituting these expressions into the definition of $G$:\n$$\nG = \\frac{\\Delta \\Pi_{\\text{released}}}{\\Delta A} = \\frac{W_{\\text{closure}}}{b \\Delta a}\n$$\nThis leads to the final discrete expression for the energy release rate based on the provided nodal quantities and the specified contact consistency:\n$$\nG = \\frac{ \\max(0, F_x^{\\mathrm{ahead}} \\delta_x^{\\mathrm{behind}}) + \\max(0, F_y^{\\mathrm{ahead}} \\delta_y^{\\mathrm{behind}}) }{2 b \\Delta a}\n$$\nThis expression satisfies Task 1.\n\nFor Task 2, the algorithm directly follows from this formula:\n1.
