We will proceed in three steps as outlined: determining the stress singularity, analyzing the scaling of energy density, and finally deriving the relationship between the $J$-integral and the stress intensity factor.\n\nFirst, we address the nature of the stress field near the crack tip. The problem stipulates that the Airy stress function, $\\Phi$, which governs the two-dimensional stress state, has a separable form in polar coordinates $(r, \\theta)$ centered at the tip: $\\Phi(r, \\theta) = r^{\\lambda+1}F(\\theta)$. Here, $\\lambda$ is an exponent to be determined. The stress components in polar coordinates are derived from $\\Phi$ as:\n$$\n\\sigma_{rr} = \\frac{1}{r}\\frac{\\partial\\Phi}{\\partial r} + \\frac{1}{r^2}\\frac{\\partial^2\\Phi}{\\partial\\theta^2}\n$$\n$$\n\\sigma_{\\theta\\theta} = \\frac{\\partial^2\\Phi}{\\partial r^2}\n$$\n$$\n\\sigma_{r\\theta} = -\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial r}\\left(\\frac{1}{r}\\frac{\\partial\\Phi}{\\partial\\theta}\\right)\n$$\nSubstituting the assumed form of $\\Phi$ into these relations, we find the radial dependence of the stresses:\n$$\n\\sigma_{rr} = \\frac{1}{r}(\\lambda+1)r^{\\lambda}F(\\theta) + \\frac{1}{r^2}r^{\\lambda+1}F''(\\theta) = r^{\\lambda-1}[(\\lambda+1)F(\\theta) + F''(\\theta)]\n$$\n$$\n\\sigma_{\\theta\\theta} = (\\lambda+1)\\lambda r^{\\lambda-1}F(\\theta)\n$$\n$$\n\\sigma_{r\\theta} = -\\lambda r^{\\lambda-1}F'(\\theta)\n$$\nAll stress components thus share a common radial dependence of $r^{\\lambda-1}$. For a stress singularity to exist as $r \\to 0$, we must have $\\lambda-1 < 0$, which implies $\\lambda < 1$. Furthermore, the total strain energy stored in the body must be finite. The strain energy density, $W$, is quadratic in stress, so $W \\propto \\sigma^2 \\propto (r^{\\lambda-1})^2 = r^{2\\lambda-2}$. The total energy in a small disk of radius $\\epsilon$ around the tip scales as $\\int_0^{\\epsilon} W r dr \\propto \\int_0^{\\epsilon} r^{2\\lambda-2} r dr = \\int_0^{\\epsilon} r^{2\\lambda-1} dr \\propto \\epsilon^{2\\lambda}$. For this energy to be finite and to vanish as $\\epsilon \\to 0$, it is required that $2\\lambda > 0$, or $\\lambda > 0$. Thus, any physically admissible singular solution must have an exponent $\\lambda \\in (0, 1)$.\n\nThe exponent $\\lambda$ is determined as an eigenvalue problem by substituting $\\Phi$ into the governing biharmonic equation, $\\nabla^4\\Phi=0$, and applying boundary conditions. The crack faces at $\\theta=\\pm\\pi$ are traction-free, which means $\\sigma_{\\theta\\theta}(r, \\pm\\pi) = 0$ and $\\sigma_{r\\theta}(r, \\pm\\pi) = 0$. These conditions translate to $F(\\pm\\pi)=0$ and $F'(\\pm\\pi)=0$. The solution of the eigenvalue problem for symmetric (Mode I) fields yields admissible values of $\\lambda_n = n + 1/2$ for any integer $n$. The condition $\\lambda > 0$ restricts us to positive values. The leading-order term in the stress field as $r \\to 0$ corresponds to the strongest singularity, which is associated with the smallest positive value of $\\lambda$. This is $\\lambda = 1/2$, for $n=0$. This is the largest singular exponent. Consequently, the stress field near the crack tip exhibits the characteristic square-root singularity:\n$$\n\\sigma_{ij} \\propto r^{\\lambda-1} = r^{1/2-1} = r^{-1/2}\n$$\n\nSecond, we analyze the scaling of the strain energy density $W$. The amplitude of the singular stress field is characterized by the Mode I stress intensity factor, $K$. By definition, the near-tip stress field is written as:\n$$\n\\sigma_{ij}(r, \\theta) = \\frac{K}{\\sqrt{2\\pi r}} f_{ij}(\\theta) + \\text{higher order terms}\n$$\nwhere $f_{ij}(\\theta)$ are dimensionless angular functions. The scaling is $\\sigma_{ij} \\propto K r^{-1/2}$. The material is linear elastic, so the strain components $\\epsilon_{ij}$ are linearly proportional to the stress components. The constitutive law can be expressed as $\\epsilon_{ij} = S_{ijkl}\\sigma_{kl}$, where the compliance tensor $S_{ijkl}$ depends on the elastic moduli. For an isotropic material, this relationship simplifies such that $\\epsilon_{ij}$ scales with $\\sigma_{ij}/E'$, where $E'$ is the generalized modulus ($E'$ for plane stress is $E$, and for plane strain is $E/(1-\\nu^2)$). Therefore, $\\epsilon_{ij} \\propto K/(E'r^{1/2})$. The strain energy density is given by $W = \\frac{1}{2}\\sigma_{ij}\\epsilon_{ij}$. Using the scaling relations for stress and strain, we deduce the scaling for $W$:\n$$\nW \\propto \\sigma \\cdot \\epsilon \\propto \\left( \\frac{K}{\\sqrt{r}} \\right) \\left( \\frac{K}{E'\\sqrt{r}} \\right) = \\frac{K^2}{E' r}\n$$\nThus, the strain energy density scales as $r^{-1}$ near the crack tip.\n\nThird, we establish the relationship between the $J$-integral, $K$, and the elastic constants. The $J$-integral is defined as\n$$\nJ = \\int_{\\Gamma}\\left(W\\,\\delta_{1j}-\\sigma_{ij}\\,u_{i,1}\\right)n_{j}\\,ds\n$$\nA fundamental property of $J$ in elasticity is its path independence, meaning its value is the same for any counterclockwise contour $\\Gamma$ enclosing the crack tip. In the context of LEFM, $J$ is equal to the energy release rate, $G$. The energy release rate is the amount of potential energy released from the structure per unit area of crack extension. We can calculate $G$ using Irwin's virtual crack closure integral. This method calculates the work done by the stresses on the crack plane that is required to close the crack over an infinitesimal length $\\delta a$. This work must equal the energy released, $G \\cdot \\delta a$ (for a unit thickness).\n$$\nG\\,\\delta a = \\frac{1}{2} \\int_0^{\\delta a} \\sigma_{yy}(x', 0) \\Delta u_y(\\delta a-x') dx'\n$$\nHere, the coordinate $x'$ is measured from the original crack tip along the crack line. $\\sigma_{yy}(x', 0)$ is the opening stress ahead of the original tip, and $\\Delta u_y(\\delta a-x')$ is the crack opening displacement for the extended crack, evaluated at a distance $r' = \\delta a - x'$ from the new tip.\nThe required asymptotic fields for Mode I are:\n$$\n\\sigma_{yy}(r, \\theta=0) = \\frac{K}{\\sqrt{2\\pi r}}\n$$\n$$\n\\Delta u_y(r) = u_y(r, \\pi) - u_y(r, -\\pi) = \\frac{K(\\kappa+1)}{4G_s}\\sqrt{\\frac{2r}{\\pi}}\n$$\nwhere $G_s$ is the shear modulus ($G_s = E/(2(1+\\nu))$) and $\\kappa$ is Muskhelishvili's constant ($\\kappa = 3-4\\nu$ for plane strain, $\\kappa=(3-\\nu)/(1+\\nu)$ for plane stress).\nSubstituting these into the work integral:\n$$\nG\\,\\delta a = \\frac{1}{2} \\int_0^{\\delta a} \\frac{K}{\\sqrt{2\\pi x'}} \\frac{K(\\kappa+1)}{4G_s}\\sqrt{\\frac{2(\\delta a-x')}{\\pi}} dx' = \\frac{K^2(\\kappa+1)}{8\\pi G_s} \\int_0^{\\delta a} \\frac{\\sqrt{\\delta a-x'}}{\\sqrt{x'}} dx'\n$$\nThe integral evaluates to $\\int_0^{\\delta a} \\sqrt{\\frac{\\delta a}{x'} - 1} dx' = \\frac{\\pi \\delta a}{2}$. This is a standard result obtained by the substitution $x' = \\delta a \\sin^2\\phi$.\nSubstituting the result of the integral back into the expression for $G\\,\\delta a$:\n$$\nG\\,\\delta a = \\frac{K^2(\\kappa+1)}{8\\pi G_s} \\left(\\frac{\\pi \\delta a}{2}\\right) = \\frac{K^2(\\kappa+1)}{16G_s} \\delta a\n$$\nThis gives the energy release rate as $G = \\frac{K^2(\\kappa+1)}{16G_s}$. There is an error in the derivation above. Let us re-examine the displacement relation.\nThe correct displacement field is $u_y = \\frac{K}{2G_s}\\sqrt{\\frac{r}{2\\pi}} \\sin(\\frac{\\theta}{2})(\\kappa+1-2\\cos^2(\\frac{\\theta}{2}))$.\nThis gives $\\Delta u_y = u_y(r,\\pi)-u_y(r,-\\pi) = 2 \\frac{K}{2G_s}\\sqrt{\\frac{r}{2\\pi}}(\\kappa+1) = \\frac{K(\\kappa+1)}{G_s}\\sqrt{\\frac{r}{2\\pi}}$.\nThe work integral becomes:\n$$\nG\\,\\delta a = \\frac{1}{2} \\int_0^{\\delta a} \\frac{K}{\\sqrt{2\\pi x'}} \\frac{K(\\kappa+1)}{G_s}\\sqrt{\\frac{\\delta a-x'}{2\\pi}} dx' = \\frac{K^2(\\kappa+1)}{4\\pi G_s} \\int_0^{\\delta a} \\frac{\\sqrt{\\delta a-x'}}{\\sqrt{x'}} dx'\n$$\n$$\nG\\,\\delta a = \\frac{K^2(\\kappa+1)}{4\\pi G_s} \\left(\\frac{\\pi \\delta a}{2}\\right) = \\frac{K^2(\\kappa+1)}{8G_s} \\delta a\n$$\nSo, $G = \\frac{K^2(\\kappa+1)}{8G_s}$. Now, substituting for plane strain: $\\kappa=3-4\\nu$ and $G_s = E/(2(1+\\nu))$.\n$$\nG = \\frac{K^2(3-4\\nu+1)}{8(E/(2(1+\\nu)))} = \\frac{K^2 \\cdot 4(1-\\nu)}{4E/(1+\\nu)} = \\frac{K^2 (1-\\nu)(1+\\nu)}{E} = \\frac{K^2(1-\\nu^2)}{E}\n$$\nThis result is correct. Since $J=G$ for linear elasticity, the final expression for the $J$-integral under plane strain conditions is:\n$$\nJ = \\frac{K^2(1-\\nu^2)}{E}\n$$\nThis expression relates the path-independent contour integral $J$ to the near-tip field parameter $K$ and the material properties $E$ and $\\nu$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\frac{K^2(1-\\nu^2)}{E}}\n$$", "id": "2685172"}, {"introduction": "Real-world components are often subjected to multiple loads simultaneously.

The boundary condition on the crack faces ($y=0$, $|x|<a$) is $\\sigma_{yy} = -p$. The negative sign arises because a positive pressure $p$ exerts a traction that corresponds to a compressive normal stress component.\n\nSuperposition is applied as follows:\nProblem I: An uncracked infinite plane subjected to a uniform far-field stress $\\sigma_{yy} = \\sigma_{\\infty}$. The stress state everywhere in this body is uniform: $\\sigma_{yy} = \\sigma_{\\infty}$, and all other components are zero.

Second, we must account for the fluid pressure $p$, which corresponds to an additional stress of $\\sigma_{yy} = -p$. Therefore, the total normal stress to be applied on the crack faces in Problem II is $\\sigma_{yy} = -(\\sigma_{\\infty} + p)$.
