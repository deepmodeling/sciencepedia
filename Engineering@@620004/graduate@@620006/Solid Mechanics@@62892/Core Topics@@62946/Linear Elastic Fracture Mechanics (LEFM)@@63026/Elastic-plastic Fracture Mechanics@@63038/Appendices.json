Mastering this derivation provides a deep insight into why plasticity blunts the stress singularity observed in linear elastic fracture mechanics.", "problem": "A stationary Mode I crack in a ductile solid under small-scale yielding is considered in plane strain. The constitutive response in the near-tip region is dominated by plasticity and is modeled as isotropic, rate-independent von Mises (J2) plasticity with power-law hardening. The equivalent true stress and equivalent plastic strain satisfy the relation $\\sigma_{e} = K \\, \\epsilon_{p}^{1/n}$, where $K$ is a positive strength parameter and $n>0$ is the strain-hardening exponent. In the asymptotic Hutchinson–Rice–Rosengren (HRR) near-tip region, assume the fields are self-similar and admit radial power-law scalings of the form $\\sigma_{ij}(r,\\theta) \\sim r^{-\\lambda} \\, \\Sigma_{ij}(\\theta)$ and $\\epsilon^{p}_{ij}(r,\\theta) \\sim r^{-\\mu} \\, E^{p}_{ij}(\\theta)$ as $r \\to 0^{+}$, where $\\Sigma_{ij}(\\theta)$ and $E^{p}_{ij}(\\theta)$ are bounded angular functions that do not alter the radial exponents $\\lambda$ and $\\mu$.

No rounding is required, and no units are to be included in the final answer.", "solution": "The derivation proceeds by establishing two independent relationships between the exponents $\\lambda$ and $\\mu$ using the provided physical and constitutive laws.\n\nFirst, a relationship is derived from the power-law constitutive relation. The problem states that in the near-tip region, the equivalent stress $\\sigma_{e}$ and equivalent plastic strain $\\epsilon_{p}$ follow the relation $\\sigma_{e} = K \\, \\epsilon_{p}^{1/n}$. The tensor components of stress and plastic strain have the assumed radial scalings $\\sigma_{ij} \\sim r^{-\\lambda}$ and $\\epsilon_{ij}^{p} \\sim r^{-\\mu}$. The scalar equivalent quantities must share these scalings. Thus, we have:\n$$\n\\sigma_{e} \\propto r^{-\\lambda}\n$$\n$$\n\\epsilon_{p} \\propto r^{-\\mu}\n$$\nSubstituting these scaling relations into the constitutive law gives:\n$$\nr^{-\\lambda} \\propto (r^{-\\mu})^{1/n} = r^{-\\mu/n}\n$$\nFor this proportionality to hold for all $r$ as $r \\to 0^{+}$, the exponents of $r$ must be equal. This yields the first equation relating the exponents:\n$$\n\\lambda = \\frac{\\mu}{n} \\quad \\text{or} \\quad \\mu = n\\lambda\n$$\n\nSecond, a relationship is derived from the properties of the $J$-integral. The problem states that the $J$-integral is path-independent, meaning its value does not depend on the integration path $\\Gamma$ taken around the crack tip. The $J$-integral is defined as:\n$$\nJ = \\int_{\\Gamma} \\left( W \\, dx_2 - T_i \\frac{\\partial u_i}{\\partial x_1} ds \\right)\n$$\nwhere $W$ is the strain energy density, $T_i = \\sigma_{ij} n_j$ is the traction vector on the path $\\Gamma$, and $u_i$ is the displacement vector. In the plastic zone near the tip, the elastic strains are negligible compared to the plastic strains, and the strain energy density $W$ is dominated by the plastic work density $W_p$. For the given power-law material, $W_p$ is:\n$$\nW_p = \\int_0^{\\epsilon_p} \\sigma_e(\\bar{\\epsilon}_p) \\, d\\bar{\\epsilon}_p = \\int_0^{\\epsilon_p} K (\\bar{\\epsilon}_p)^{1/n} \\, d\\bar{\\epsilon}_p = \\frac{K}{1 + 1/n} (\\epsilon_p)^{1 + 1/n} = \\frac{n}{n+1} (K (\\epsilon_p)^{1/n}) \\epsilon_p = \\frac{n}{n+1} \\sigma_e \\epsilon_p\n$$\nThe scaling of $W_p$ is therefore determined by the product of the scalings of $\\sigma_e$ and $\\epsilon_p$:\n$$\nW_p \\propto \\sigma_e \\epsilon_p \\propto (r^{-\\lambda})(r^{-\\mu}) = r^{-(\\lambda+\\mu)}\n$$\nThe second term in the $J$-integral integrand involves the product of traction $T_i$ and displacement gradient $\\partial u_i / \\partial x_1$. The traction $T_i$ scales with stress, $T_i \\propto \\sigma_{ij} \\propto r^{-\\lambda}$. The displacement gradients scale with strain. Since plastic strains dominate, $\\epsilon_{ij} \\approx \\epsilon_{ij}^p \\propto r^{-\\mu}$. From the strain-displacement relation $\\epsilon_{ij} = \\frac{1}{2} (\\partial u_i / \\partial x_j + \\partial u_j / \\partial x_i)$, the displacement gradients must have the same scaling as the strains:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial u_i}{\\partial x_j} \\propto r^{-\\mu}\n$$\nTherefore, the second term in the integrand scales as:\n$$\nT_i \\frac{\\partial u_i}{\\partial x_1} \\propto (r^{-\\lambda})(r^{-\\mu}) = r^{-(\\lambda+\\mu)}\n$$\nBoth terms in the integrand of the $J$-integral have the same radial scaling, $r^{-(\\lambda+\\mu)}$. Now, consider a circular integration path $\\Gamma$ of radius $r$ around the crack tip. The infinitesimal arc length is $ds = r \\, d\\theta$. The $J$-integral is computed as:\n$$\nJ \\propto \\int_0^{2\\pi} (\\text{integrand with scaling } r^{-(\\lambda+\\mu)}) \\cdot (r \\, d\\theta)\n$$\nThe factors of $r$ can be taken out of the integral over $\\theta$:\n$$\nJ \\propto r^{-(\\lambda+\\mu)} \\cdot r = r^{1 - (\\lambda+\\mu)}\n$$\nSince the $J$-integral must be path-independent (i.e., independent of the radius $r$), the exponent of $r$ in its scaling relation must be zero. This provides the second equation:\n$$\n1 - (\\lambda+\\mu) = 0 \\quad \\text{or} \\quad \\lambda + \\mu = 1\n$$\n\nWe now have a system of two linear equations for $\\lambda$ and $\\mu$:\n1. $\\mu = n\\lambda$\n2. $\\lambda + \\mu = 1$\n\nSubstituting the first equation into the second gives:\n$$\n\\lambda + (n\\lambda) = 1 \\implies \\lambda(1+n) = 1 \\implies \\lambda = \\frac{1}{n+1}\n$$\nSubstituting this result back into the first equation yields $\\mu$:\n$$\n\\mu = n\\lambda = n \\left(\\frac{1}{n+1}\\right) = \\frac{n}{n+1}\n$$\nThese are the general expressions for the HRR exponents in terms of the strain-hardening exponent $n$.\n\nFor the specific case of $n=10$, the numerical values are:\n$$\n\\lambda = \\frac{1}{10+1} = \\frac{1}{11}\n$$\n$$\n\\mu = \\frac{10}{10+1} = \\frac{10}{11}\n$$\n\nFinally, we compare the strength of the HRR stress singularity with the linear elastic fracture mechanics (LEFM) singularity. The HRR stress field scales as $\\sigma_{ij} \\sim r^{-\\lambda} = r^{-1/(n+1)}$. The LEFM stress field scales as $\\sigma_{ij} \\sim r^{-1/2}$. For a ductile material undergoing strain hardening, $n>1$. In this problem, $n=10$.\nWe compare the exponents:\n$$\n\\lambda = \\frac{1}{n+1} = \\frac{1}{11}\n$$\nThe LEFM exponent is $1/2$. Since $11 > 2$, it follows that $\\frac{1}{11} < \\frac{1}{2}$.\nA smaller positive exponent in the singularity $r^{-p}$ corresponds to a less severe (weaker) singularity, as the function approaches infinity more slowly as $r \\to 0^{+}$. Therefore, for $n=10$, the HRR stress singularity is weaker than the linear elastic singularity. This blunting of the stress peak is a direct consequence of plastic deformation at the crack tip.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{1}{11} & \\frac{10}{11} \\end{pmatrix}}\n$$", "id": "2634176"}, {"introduction": "In many engineering scenarios, the assumption of small-scale yielding (SSY) provides a powerful bridge between linear elastic and elastic-plastic fracture mechanics.

You will also develop the essential skill of estimating the plastic zone size to quantitatively justify when this simplifying assumption is valid.", "problem": "A wide plate containing a centrally located through-thickness crack is loaded in remote tension such that the stress intensity factor for mode I is $K_I=50\\,\\text{MPa}\\sqrt{\\text{m}}$.

Use this correlation to estimate the value of $J$.

State any intermediate assumptions clearly, and restrict your numerical substitution to the final step.", "solution": "The central task is to relate the stress intensity factor $K_I$ to the $J$-integral under the condition of small-scale yielding (SSY) and then use this relationship to perform calculations and analysis.\n\nFirst, we establish the correlation between the $J$-integral and the stress intensity factor $K_I$. The $J$-integral is defined as the energy release rate in a non-linear elastic material. For a linear elastic material, the energy release rate is denoted by $G$. Under the assumption that the material behavior is linear elastic, the $J$-integral is equivalent to $G$.\n$$J = G$$\nFor a mode I crack in an isotropic linear elastic material under plane strain conditions, the energy release rate $G$ is related to the stress intensity factor $K_I$ by the following expression:\n$$G = \\frac{1 - \\nu^2}{E} K_I^2$$\nwhere $E$ is the Young's modulus and $\\nu$ is the Poisson's ratio.\n\nThe problem specifies small-scale yielding. This assumption is crucial. It implies that the region of plastic deformation at the crack tip is small and contained within a much larger, surrounding elastic field. This remote elastic field is uniquely characterized by the stress intensity factor $K_I$. Because the $J$-integral is path-independent, we can evaluate it along a contour far from the crack tip, residing entirely within the region of elastic behavior. On such a contour, the material is effectively linear elastic, and the relationship between $J$ and the far-field parameter $K_I$ must be the same as the linear elastic one. Therefore, for small-scale yielding in plane strain, the appropriate correlation is:\n$$J = \\frac{1 - \\nu^2}{E} K_I^2$$\nThis relation connects the elastic-plastic parameter $J$, which characterizes the near-tip fields (the HRR fields), to the linear elastic parameter $K_I$, which characterizes the remote loading.\n\nNext, we use this correlation to estimate the value of $J$. The given values are:\n$K_I = 50\\,\\text{MPa}\\sqrt{\\text{m}} = 50 \\times 10^6\\,\\text{Pa}\\,\\text{m}^{1/2}$\n$E = 210\\,\\text{GPa} = 210 \\times 10^9\\,\\text{Pa}$\n$\\nu = 0.30$\n\nSubstituting these values into the equation for $J$:\n$$J = \\frac{1 - (0.30)^2}{210 \\times 10^9\\,\\text{Pa}} (50 \\times 10^6\\,\\text{Pa}\\,\\text{m}^{1/2})^2$$\n$$J = \\frac{1 - 0.09}{210 \\times 10^9} (2500 \\times 10^{12})\\,\\frac{\\text{Pa}^2 \\cdot \\text{m}}{\\text{Pa}}$$\n$$J = \\frac{0.91 \\times 2500 \\times 10^{12}}{210 \\times 10^9}\\,\\text{Pa} \\cdot \\text{m}$$\nThe units of $\\text{Pa} \\cdot \\text{m}$ are equivalent to $(\\text{N}/\\text{m}^2) \\cdot \\text{m} = \\text{N} \\cdot \\text{m} / \\text{m}^2 = \\text{J}/\\text{m}^2$.\n$$J = \\frac{2275}{210} \\times 10^3\\,\\frac{\\text{J}}{\\text{m}^2}$$\n$$J \\approx 10.8333... \\times 10^3\\,\\frac{\\text{J}}{\\text{m}^2}$$\nThe problem requires the answer in units of $\\text{kJ}/\\text{m}^2$.\n$$J \\approx 10.8333...\\,\\frac{\\text{kJ}}{\\text{m}^2}$$\nRounding to four significant figures gives $J = 10.83\\,\\text{kJ}/\\text{m}^2$.\n\nNow, we must justify the small-scale yielding assumption by estimating the plastic zone size. We use a standard Irwin-based estimate for the plane strain plastic zone size, $r_p$. This size can be approximated by considering the region where the effective stress exceeds the yield strength, $\\sigma_y$. A commonly used estimate for the maximum extent of the plastic zone under plane strain is:\n$$r_p \\approx \\frac{1}{3\\pi} \\left(\\frac{K_I}{\\sigma_y}\\right)^2$$\nWe are given $K_I = 50\\,\\text{MPa}\\sqrt{\\text{m}}$ and the yield strength $\\sigma_y = 500\\,\\text{MPa}$.\nThe ratio $\\frac{K_I}{\\sigma_y}$ is:\n$$\\frac{K_I}{\\sigma_y} = \\frac{50\\,\\text{MPa}\\sqrt{\\text{m}}}{500\\,\\text{MPa}} = 0.1\\,\\text{m}^{1/2}$$\nNow, we calculate the plastic zone size:\n$$r_p \\approx \\frac{1}{3\\pi} (0.1\\,\\text{m}^{1/2})^2 = \\frac{0.01}{3\\pi}\\,\\text{m} \\approx 0.00106\\,\\text{m}$$\nThis corresponds to a plastic zone size of approximately $1.06\\,\\text{mm}$. The condition for small-scale yielding is that this plastic zone size must be much smaller than other relevant geometric dimensions of the cracked body, such as the crack length $a$ and the ligament width. Since the problem describes a \"wide plate,\" we can assume that its characteristic dimensions are orders of magnitude larger than $1.06\\,\\text{mm}$ (e.g., several centimeters). Therefore, the condition $r_p \\ll a$ is satisfied, and the assumption of small-scale yielding is justified.\n\nFinally, we discuss the implications of this estimate and the hardening exponent $n$ on the accuracy of the $J-K$ correlation. The correlation $J = (1 - \\nu^2)K_I^2/E$ is fundamentally a linear elastic concept extended to an elastic-plastic material under the restrictive assumption of SSY. Its accuracy depends directly on the validity of this assumption.\n\nThe primary factor governing the accuracy is the size of the plastic zone, $r_p$, relative to a characteristic geometric length, $L$ (e.g., crack length $a$). As long as the ratio $r_p/L$ is small (typically less than $0.02 - 0.05$), the remote elastic $K_I$-field remains largely unperturbed by the crack-tip plasticity, and it correctly dictates the energy flow rate, $J$, into the plastic zone. Our estimate of $r_p \\approx 1.06\\,\\text{mm}$ supports this condition for a typical 'wide plate' geometry. If the load (and thus $K_I$) were to increase, $r_p$ would grow quadratically, and the SSY assumption, along with the accuracy of the $J-K$ correlation, would eventually break down. At that point, $J$ would become greater than the value predicted from $K_I$.\n\nThe hardening exponent $n=10$ characterizes the material's post-yield behavior within the HRR field. The stresses in the HRR solution are singular as $r^{-1/(n+1)}$, which for $n=10$ is $r^{-1/11}$. A larger value of $n$ signifies a material that strain-hardens less (approaching elastic-perfectly plastic behavior as $n \\to \\infty$). This affects the distribution and magnitude of stress and strain *within* the plastic zone. However, for a fixed $J$, the internal field structure changes with $n$, but the validity of the SSY $J-K$ correlation itself is not strongly dependent on $n$. The correlation connects the far-field loading ($K_I$) to the near-tip field amplitude ($J$). As long as the plasticity is contained (SSY holds), this connection is robust. The value of $n$ is critical for describing the state inside the plastic zone and becomes particularly important when SSY breaks down and more complex elastic-plastic analyses are required, but it is a secondary factor affecting the accuracy of the $J-K$ relationship within the SSY regime. The dominant constraint on accuracy remains the relative size of the plastic zone.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{10.83}$$", "id": "2634215"}, {"introduction": "A material's resistance to fracture is not absolute; it strongly depends on the level of stress triaxiality, or 'constraint', at the crack tip, with specimen thickness playing a critical role.

Under these conditions, the J-integral, $J$, serves as the single parameter that characterizes the intensity of the near-tip fields.\n\nThe fundamental parameters governing the local mechanical state are the loading intensity, $J$, which has units of energy per unit area or force per unit length ($[F][L]^{-1}$), and the material's resistance to plastic flow, represented by the uniaxial yield stress, $\\sigma_{y}$, which has units of force per unit area ($[F][L]^{-2}$).

A state of plane strain, characterized by the suppression of out-of-plane strain ($\\epsilon_{zz} \\approx 0$) and consequently high stress triaxiality (high constraint), can only be achieved if the thickness $B$ is substantially larger than the in-plane size of the plastic zone, $\\ell_{p}$.
