The normal stress $\\sigma'_{yy}$ drives Mode I opening, and the shear stress $\\sigma'_{xy}$ drives Mode II sliding. The standard formulas are $K_I = \\sigma_{\\text{normal}}\\sqrt{\\pi a}$ and $K_{II} = \\tau_{\\text{shear}}\\sqrt{\\pi a}$.\n\nThere is a convention regarding the sign of $K_{II}$ based on the relative sliding of the crack faces. The shear stress $\\sigma'_{xy}$ on the positive $y'$ face is in the negative $x'$ direction. For a crack tip at positive $x'$, this corresponds to a negative $K_{II}$, while at negative $x'$ it corresponds to a positive $K_{II}$. However, the problem does not distinguish between crack tips, and standard mixed-mode fracture criteria depend on $K_{II}^2$.

Thus, the angle that maximizes the energy release rate is $\\theta_{\\max} = 0$. This corresponds to the crack being oriented perpendicular to the applied tensile stress, which is the most critical orientation for fracture initiation.\n\nThe final results are collected as requested.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} \\sigma \\sqrt{\\pi a} \\cos^2\\theta & \\sigma \\sqrt{\\pi a} \\sin\\theta \\cos\\theta & \\frac{\\sigma^2 \\pi a (1-\\nu^2)}{E} \\cos^2\\theta & 0 \\end{pmatrix}}\n$$", "id": "2645531"}, {"introduction": "While Griffith's theory provides a powerful global energy balance, it treats the crack tip as a mathematical singularity.

The protocol involves testing geometrically similar specimens. This implies that all linear dimensions are scaled proportionally. Let $s$ be the scaling factor. Then:\n$W \\mapsto sW_0$, $B \\mapsto sB_0$, $S \\mapsto sS_0$, $a \\mapsto sa_0$, $\\rho \\mapsto s\\rho_0$.\nThis means the dimensionless ratios $\\alpha = a/W$, $S/W$, $B/W$, and $\\rho/W$ are held constant throughout the test series. We seek a relation $P_c \\propto W^m$, where the exponent $m$ differs for the two hypotheses.\n\n**Hypothesis (i): Energy-based failure ($G = G_c$)**\nThis hypothesis is the foundation of Linear Elastic Fracture Mechanics (LEFM). For a linear elastic material, the condition $G = G_c$ is equivalent to the stress intensity factor $K_I$ reaching the critical value $K_{Ic}$, the fracture toughness, which is a material constant.\nThe stress intensity factor for a SENB specimen is given by the general form:\n$$K_I = \\frac{P S}{B W^{3/2}} f\\left(\\frac{a}{W}\\right)$$\nwhere $f(a/W)$ is a dimensionless geometry function. Since we maintain geometric similarity, the ratio $a/W = \\alpha$ is constant, and the ratio $S/W$ is also constant. Therefore, the function $f(\\alpha)$ is a constant for the entire family of specimens.\n\nAt the point of failure, $P = P_c$ and $K_I = K_{Ic}$.\n$$K_{Ic} = \\frac{P_c S}{B W^{3/2}} f(\\alpha)$$\nWe can rearrange to solve for the failure load $P_c$:\n$$P_c = K_{Ic} \\frac{B W^{3/2}}{S f(\\alpha)}$$\nNow, we apply the geometric scaling laws: $B \\propto W$ and $S \\propto W$. Let $B = c_B W$ and $S = c_S W$, where $c_B$ and $c_S$ are constants.\n$$P_c = K_{Ic} \\frac{(c_B W) W^{3/2}}{(c_S W) f(\\alpha)} = \\left(\\frac{K_{Ic} c_B}{c_S f(\\alpha)}\\right) W^{3/2}$$\nSince the term in the parentheses is a constant, we find the scaling law:\n$$P_c \\propto W^{3/2}$$\nOn a logarithmic plot, this gives a linear relationship:\n$$\\log(P_c) = \\frac{3}{2}\\log(W) + \\text{constant}$$\nThe slope of $\\log(P_c)$ versus $\\log(W)$ is $m = 3/2$.\n\n**Hypothesis (ii): Stress-based failure ($\\sigma_{\\text{loc}} = \\sigma_{\\text{loc},c}$)**\nThis hypothesis posits that failure initiates when the maximum local stress at the notch root reaches a critical value $\\sigma_{\\text{loc},c}$, a material constant. For a sharp notch with a finite root radius $\\rho$, the peak stress is related to the stress intensity factor $K_I$ by the Creager-Paris approximation:\n$$\\sigma_{\\text{loc}} \\approx \\frac{2 K_I}{\\sqrt{\\pi \\rho}}$$\nAt failure, $\\sigma_{\\text{loc}} = \\sigma_{\\text{loc},c}$ and $P = P_c$. The value of $K_I$ at failure is $K_{I,c}$ (not a material constant here, but its value when the failure condition is met).\n$$\\sigma_{\\text{loc},c} = \\frac{2 K_{I,c}}{\\sqrt{\\pi \\rho}}$$\nSubstituting the expression for $K_{I,c} = \\frac{P_c S}{B W^{3/2}} f(\\alpha)$:\n$$\\sigma_{\\text{loc},c} = \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{\\pi \\rho}} \\left(\\frac{P_c S}{B W^{3/2}} f(\\alpha)\\right)$$\nSolving for $P_c$:\n$$P_c = \\sigma_{\\text{loc},c} \\frac{\\sqrt{\\pi \\rho} B W^{3/2}}{2 S f(\\alpha)}$$\nNow, we apply the geometric scaling laws: $\\rho \\propto W$, $B \\propto W$, and $S \\propto W$. Let $\\rho = c_\\rho W$, $B = c_B W$, and $S = c_S W$.\n$$P_c = \\sigma_{\\text{loc},c} \\frac{\\sqrt{\\pi c_\\rho W} (c_B W) W^{3/2}}{2 (c_S W) f(\\alpha)} = \\left(\\frac{\\sigma_{\\text{loc},c} \\sqrt{\\pi c_\\rho} c_B}{2 c_S f(\\alpha)}\\right) \\frac{W^{1/2} W^1 W^{3/2}}{W}$$\n$$P_c = (\\text{constant}) \\frac{W^3}{W} = (\\text{constant}) W^2$$\nThe scaling law is:\n$$P_c \\propto W^2$$\nOn a logarithmic plot, this gives:\n$$\\log(P_c) = 2\\log(W) + \\text{constant}$$\nThe slope of $\\log(P_c)$ versus $\\log(W)$ is $m=2$.\n\n**Evaluation of Options**\n\n*   **Option A:**\n    This option proposes testing a geometrically similar series where all linear dimensions, including $W, B, S, \\rho$, are scaled proportionally while keeping $\\alpha = a/W$ fixed. It suggests plotting $\\log P_c$ versus $\\log W$. It predicts a slope $m = 3/2$ for a critical $G$ (or $K_{Ic}$) criterion and $m = 2$ for a critical local stress criterion. My derivation confirms these exponents precisely. The protocol is sound, and the analysis is correct. This method provides a clear and robust way to distinguish between the two hypotheses.\n    **Verdict: Correct.**\n\n*   **Option B:**\n    This option proposes scaling $W, S, \\rho$ while keeping the thickness $B$ fixed. This test series is not geometrically similar, as the ratio $B/W$ changes with specimen size. My derivation relied on full geometric similarity. If we re-derive the scaling for this specific protocol:\n    - For hypothesis (i): $P_c \\propto \\frac{B W^{3/2}}{S} \\propto \\frac{(\\text{const}) W^{3/2}}{W} \\propto W^{1/2}$. The slope would be $m=1/2$.\n    - For hypothesis (ii): $P_c \\propto \\frac{\\sqrt{\\rho} B W^{3/2}}{S} \\propto \\frac{\\sqrt{W} (\\text{const}) W^{3/2}}{W} \\propto W^1$. The slope would be $m=1$.\n    The exponents $3/2$ and $2$ cited in this option are incorrect for the experiment described.\n    **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n*   **Option C:**\n    This option proposes the correct experimental protocol (full geometric similarity, same as A). However, it suggests plotting the nominal bending strength $\\sigma_{N,c} = P_c/(B W)$ versus $W$ on a log-log scale. Let us evaluate the predicted slopes.\n    - For hypothesis (i), we have $P_c \\propto W^{3/2}$. With $B \\propto W$, the nominal stress scales as $\\sigma_{N,c} \\propto \\frac{P_c}{BW} \\propto \\frac{W^{3/2}}{W \\cdot W} = W^{-1/2}$. The slope of $\\log \\sigma_{N,c}$ versus $\\log W$ is indeed $-1/2$. This part is correct.\n    - For hypothesis (ii), we have $P_c \\propto W^2$. The nominal stress scales as $\\sigma_{N,c} \\propto \\frac{P_c}{BW} \\propto \\frac{W^2}{W \\cdot W} = W^0 = \\text{constant}$. The slope of $\\log \\sigma_{N,c}$ versus $\\log W$ is $0$.\n    This option incorrectly claims the slope for the critical local stress hypothesis would be $-1$. Thus, the analysis prescribed is flawed.\n    **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n*   **Option D:**\n    This option proposes a test on a single specimen size using cyclic loading. This violates two fundamental requirements of the problem statement: it does not use \"specimen size scaling\" and it is not \"quasi-static\". Cyclic loading introduces fatigue, a different physical phenomenon. Furthermore, the proposed metric $U_c/(B a)$, where $U_c$ is the total energy absorbed, is not a valid proxy for the energy release rate $G_c$. $G_c$ is an incremental quantity defined as the rate of change of potential energy with crack area at the onset of propagation. The protocol is entirely inappropriate for the stated objective.\n    **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\nIn summary, only Option A provides a fully correct and self-consistent protocol, analysis, and interpretation to robustly discriminate between the two failure hypotheses based on size effect.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2645541"}]}
