This exercise returns to first principles, connecting the global energy balance of a cracked body to the applied stress and crack size. By deriving the energy release rate, $G$, directly from the change in potential energy, you will build a robust, fundamental understanding of the driving force for fracture as originally conceived by Griffith. This foundational practice [@problem_id:2650763] is essential before exploring the more convenient formulations introduced by Irwin.", "problem": "A linear elastic, homogeneous, isotropic infinite plate of unit thickness contains a straight central crack of total length $2a$. The plate is subjected to a uniform remote tensile stress $\\sigma$ producing symmetric Mode I opening.

The material is ideally brittle so that the only resistance to crack advance is the creation of new free surface with specific surface energy $\\gamma_{s}$.\n\nUse the following fundamental facts as your starting point:\n- In Linear Elastic Fracture Mechanics (LEFM), by superposition, the field of a cracked infinite plate under a uniform remote stress $\\sigma$ is equivalent to the field of an infinite plate with a traction-free crack whose faces are subjected to a uniform normal pressure $p=\\sigma$, in the absence of any far-field load, plus the uncracked uniform far-field solution.\n- For a straight traction-free crack of length $2a$ in an infinite linear elastic body under a uniform normal pressure $p$ applied on its faces, the exact crack opening displacement $\\delta(x)$ (top face minus bottom face) along the crack line $-a \\le x \\le a$ is\n$$\n\\delta(x) \\;=\\; \\frac{4p}{E'} \\sqrt{a^{2} - x^{2}}.\n$$\n\nStarting from these facts and from the definition of the Energy Release Rate (ERR) $G$ as the decrease of the total potential energy per unit increase of the crack surface area, do the following:\n\n1) Using Clapeyron’s theorem for linear systems, compute the change in potential energy caused by the presence of the crack under the remote stress $\\sigma$ in terms of the work required to build up the crack-face pressure field from $p=0$ to $p=\\sigma$.\n\n2) From this, derive the strain energy release rate $G(\\sigma,a,E')$ for this cracked infinite plate under uniform $\\sigma$.\n\n3) Impose the equilibrium (onset) condition from Griffith’s theory as modified by Irwin, namely that crack advance occurs when the energy release rate equals twice the specific surface energy of the newly created free surfaces, i.e., $G = 2\\gamma_{s}$, and solve for the corresponding critical remote stress $\\sigma_{c}$.\n\nExpress your final answer as a single closed-form analytic expression for $\\sigma_{c}$ in terms of $E$, $\\nu$, $\\gamma_{s}$, and $a$.

It represents a classical derivation in linear elastic fracture mechanics. All necessary data and definitions are provided, and there are no internal contradictions or factual errors. The problem is valid. We shall proceed with the solution.\n\nThe problem is solved in three sequential steps as requested. The plate has unit thickness, which is taken as $b=1$.\n\n1) Computation of the change in potential energy, $\\Delta \\Pi$:\n\nThe problem instructs to use the principle of superposition. The state of the cracked plate under a remote stress $\\sigma$ (State T) is equivalent to the superposition of an uncracked plate under the same remote stress $\\sigma$ (State 0) and an infinite plate with a traction-free crack whose faces are subjected to a uniform normal pressure $p=\\sigma$ (State 1).\n\nThe total potential energy of a linear elastic system is $\\Pi = U - W$, where $U$ is the strain energy and $W$ is the work done by external forces. We are interested in the change in potential energy due to the introduction of the crack, which is $\\Delta \\Pi = \\Pi_{T} - \\Pi_{0}$.\n\nFor a body subjected to constant external loads, a standard result in fracture mechanics states that the change in potential energy due to the introduction of a crack is equal to the negative of the work done by the stresses of the uncracked body acting over the crack opening displacements. This work, in turn, is equal to the strain energy stored in the body if the crack were closed by applying the appropriate tractions to its faces. This corresponds precisely to the strain energy of the superposed problem, State 1, but with a negative sign for the change in potential energy.\n\nThe problem prompts us to use Clapeyron's theorem for the work required to build up the crack-face pressure field from $p=0$ to $p=\\sigma$. This work is exactly the strain energy, $U_{1}$, of State 1. According to Clapeyron's theorem, this strain energy is one-half of the work done by the final crack-face pressures, $\\sigma$, acting through the final crack opening displacements, $\\delta(x)$.\n\nThe change in potential energy is therefore $\\Delta \\Pi = -U_{1}$.\n$$\nU_{1} = \\frac{1}{2} \\int_{S_{c}} \\sigma \\delta(x) \\, dS\n$$\nThe integral is over one of the crack faces. For a plate of unit thickness, the area element $dS$ is $1 \\cdot dx$.

With the pressure on the crack faces being $p=\\sigma$, this becomes $\\delta(x) = \\frac{4\\sigma}{E'} \\sqrt{a^{2} - x^{2}}$. Substituting this into the expression for $U_{1}$:\n$$\nU_{1} = \\frac{1}{2} \\int_{-a}^{a} \\sigma \\left( \\frac{4\\sigma}{E'} \\sqrt{a^{2} - x^{2}} \\right) dx = \\frac{2\\sigma^{2}}{E'} \\int_{-a}^{a} \\sqrt{a^{2} - x^{2}} \\, dx\n$$\nThe integral $\\int_{-a}^{a} \\sqrt{a^{2} - x^{2}} \\, dx$ represents the area of a semicircle of radius $a$, which is $\\frac{1}{2}\\pi a^{2}$.\n$$\nU_{1} = \\frac{2\\sigma^{2}}{E'} \\left( \\frac{\\pi a^{2}}{2} \\right) = \\frac{\\pi \\sigma^{2} a^{2}}{E'}\n$$\nThus, the change in the total potential energy of the system due to the presence of the crack is:\n$$\n\\Delta \\Pi = -\\frac{\\pi \\sigma^{2} a^{2}}{E'}\n$$\n\n2) Derivation of the strain energy release rate, $G$:\n\nThe energy release rate, $G$, is defined as the rate of decrease of total potential energy per unit increase of crack surface area.\n$$\nG = - \\frac{d\\Pi}{dA}\n$$\nThe total potential energy of the cracked plate is $\\Pi(a) = \\Pi_{0} + \\Delta\\Pi(a)$, where $\\Pi_{0}$ is the potential energy of the uncracked plate, which is independent of the crack half-length $a$.\n$$\n\\Pi(a) = \\Pi_{0} - \\frac{\\pi \\sigma^{2} a^{2}}{E'}\n$$\nFor a central crack of length $2a$ in a plate of unit thickness, an infinitesimal, symmetric increase of the crack half-length by $da$ at both tips results in an increase in total crack length of $2da$. This creates two new fracture surfaces, each of area $da \\times 1$. The total new surface area created is $dA = 2 \\cdot da \\cdot 1 = 2da$.\nTherefore, we can write $G$ as:\n$$\nG = - \\frac{d\\Pi}{2da} = - \\frac{1}{2} \\frac{d\\Pi}{da}\n$$\nWe first compute the derivative of $\\Pi$ with respect to $a$:\n$$\n\\frac{d\\Pi}{da} = \\frac{d}{da} \\left( \\Pi_{0} - \\frac{\\pi \\sigma^{2} a^{2}}{E'} \\right) = - \\frac{\\pi \\sigma^{2}}{E'} \\frac{d(a^{2})}{da} = - \\frac{2\\pi \\sigma^{2} a}{E'}\n$$\nSubstituting this into the expression for $G$:\n$$\nG = - \\frac{1}{2} \\left( - \\frac{2\\pi \\sigma^{2} a}{E'} \\right) = \\frac{\\pi \\sigma^{2} a}{E'}\n$$\nThis is the strain energy release rate $G(\\sigma, a, E')$.\n\n3) Determination of the critical stress, $\\sigma_{c}$:\n\nThe problem states that the condition for the onset of crack advance is given by the Griffith-Irwin criterion, $G = 2\\gamma_{s}$. Here, $\\gamma_{s}$ is the specific surface energy, and the factor of $2$ accounts for the creation of two new free surfaces per unit area of crack extension. The term $2\\gamma_{s}$ is also known as the critical energy release rate, $G_{c}$, or the material's fracture energy.\n\nAt the onset of fracture, the remote stress is the critical stress, $\\sigma = \\sigma_{c}$, and the energy release rate equals the fracture energy:\n$$\n\\frac{\\pi \\sigma_{c}^{2} a}{E'} = 2\\gamma_{s}\n$$\nWe solve this equation for $\\sigma_{c}$:\n$$\n\\sigma_{c}^{2} = \\frac{2\\gamma_{s} E'}{\\pi a}\n$$\n$$\n\\sigma_{c} = \\sqrt{\\frac{2\\gamma_{s} E'}{\\pi a}}\n$$\nFinally, we must express the result in terms of the fundamental material constants $E$ and $\\nu$ by substituting the given relation for the plane-strain modulus, $E' = \\frac{E}{1-\\nu^{2}}$.\n$$\n\\sigma_{c} = \\sqrt{\\frac{2\\gamma_{s}}{\\pi a} \\left( \\frac{E}{1-\\nu^{2}} \\right)} = \\sqrt{\\frac{2E\\gamma_{s}}{\\pi a (1-\\nu^{2})}}\n$$\nThis is the final expression for the critical stress. This formula yields the critical stress in Pascals ($Pa$) provided that Young's modulus $E$ is in $Pa$, the specific surface energy $\\gamma_{s}$ is in $J/m^{2}$ (or $N/m$), and the crack half-length $a$ is in $m$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\sqrt{\\frac{2E\\gamma_{s}}{\\pi a (1-\\nu^{2})}}}\n$$", "id": "2650763"}, {"introduction": "Building on the concept of the energy release rate $G$, we now turn to Irwin's pivotal contribution: the equivalence between this global energy parameter and the local stress intensity factor, $K_I$.

A solution will be provided.\n\nThe analysis proceeds by addressing the three specified tasks.\n\n**Symbolic Expression for the Energy Release Rate, $G$**\n\nIn LEFM, the stress field near the tip of a crack under Mode I (tensile) loading is characterized by the Stress Intensity Factor, $K_I$. For a crack of length $a$ subjected to a remote tensile stress $\\sigma$, $K_I$ is given by:\n$$ K_I = Y \\sigma \\sqrt{\\pi a} $$\nHere, $Y$ is a dimensionless geometry correction factor that accounts for the specific configuration of the cracked body. For a central crack in an infinite plate, $Y=1$. For an edge crack in a semi-infinite plate, the value is given as $Y=1.12$.\n\nG. R. Irwin established a relationship between the energy release rate, $G$, and the stress intensity factor, $K_I$. This relationship depends on the state of stress (plane stress or plane strain). For plane strain conditions, the relationship is:\n$$ G = \\frac{K_I^2}{E'} $$\nwhere $E'$ is the effective elastic modulus for plane strain, defined in terms of Young's modulus $E$ and Poisson's ratio $\\nu$ as:\n$$ E' = \\frac{E}{1 - \\nu^2} $$\nSubstituting the expressions for $K_I$ and $E'$ into the equation for $G$ yields the symbolic expression for the energy release rate:\n$$ G = \\frac{(Y \\sigma \\sqrt{\\pi a})^2}{\\frac{E}{1 - \\nu^2}} $$\n$$ G = \\frac{Y^2 \\sigma^2 \\pi a (1 - \\nu^2)}{E} $$\nThis is the required symbolic expression for $G$ in terms of the given parameters.\n\n**Symbolic Expression for Critical Stress, $\\sigma_c(Y)$, and Ratio, $r$**\n\nFracture is predicted to occur when the energy release rate $G$ reaches a critical value, $G_c$, which is a material property.

We collect the terms involving `$K_I^2$` on one side:\n$$\nK_I^2 - \\dfrac{\\sigma^2}{2 \\sigma_Y^2} K_I^2 = \\sigma^2 \\pi a\n$$\n$$\nK_I^2 \\left( 1 - \\dfrac{\\sigma^2}{2 \\sigma_Y^2} \\right) = \\sigma^2 \\pi a\n$$\nIsolating `$K_I^2$` yields:\n$$\nK_I^2 = \\dfrac{\\sigma^2 \\pi a}{1 - \\dfrac{\\sigma^2}{2 \\sigma_Y^2}}\n$$\nTaking the square root gives the final closed-form expression for `$K_I$`. Since the stress intensity factor is physically a positive quantity, we take the positive root:\n$$\nK_I = \\sqrt{\\dfrac{\\sigma^2 \\pi a}{1 - \\dfrac{\\sigma^2}{2 \\sigma_Y^2}}}\n$$\nThis can be rewritten by recognizing that the uncorrected LEFM SIF is `$K_{I,LEFM} = \\sigma \\sqrt{\\pi a}$`:\n$$\nK_I = K_{I,LEFM} \\left( 1 - \\dfrac{\\sigma^2}{2 \\sigma_Y^2} \\right)^{-1/2}\n$$\nThis solution is physically meaningful only when the term in the denominator is positive, which implies `$1 - \\dfrac{\\sigma^2}{2 \\sigma_Y^2} > 0$`, or `$\\sigma  \\sqrt{2} \\sigma_Y$`. This condition defines the limit of applicability of this simplified plasticity correction model.\n\n2) Formulation of the fixed-point iteration.\n\nA fixed-point iteration scheme seeks a solution to an equation of the form `$x = g(x)$` by iterating `$x_{k+1} = g(x_k)$`. We formulate such a scheme for `$K_I$`. As specified, we use the self-consistency relation derived above:\n$$\nK_I = \\sigma \\sqrt{\\pi \\left( a + \\dfrac{1}{2\\pi} \\left( \\dfrac{K_I}{\\sigma_Y} \\right)^2 \\right)}\n$$\nLet `$K_I^{(k)}$` be the estimate of the SIF at iteration `$k$`. The next estimate, `$K_I^{(k+1)}$`, is computed using the mapping function `$g(K_I^{(k)})$`. The iteration is defined as `$K_I^{(k+1)} = g(K_I^{(k)})$`, where the function `$g(K)$` is:\n$$\ng(K) = \\sigma \\sqrt{\\pi a + \\dfrac{K^2}{2 \\sigma_Y^2}}\n$$\nThe problem specifies the initial guess, which is the LEFM solution without plasticity correction:\n$$\nK_I^{(0)} = \\sigma \\sqrt{\\pi a}\n$$\nThe iteration proceeds as `$K_I^{(1)} = g(K_I^{(0)})$`, `$K_I^{(2)} = g(K_I^{(1)})$`, and so on, until convergence is achieved. The fixed point of this iteration, `$K_I = g(K_I)$`, is precisely the equation from which the closed-form solution was derived, ensuring that the iteration converges to the correct value, provided it converges at all. Convergence is guaranteed if the magnitude of the derivative `$|g'(K)|$` is less than `$1$` in the vicinity of the solution. The derivative is `$g'(K) = \\dfrac{\\sigma^2 K}{2 \\sigma_Y^2 g(K)}$`. At the fixed point `$K^*$`, where `$g(K^*) = K^*$`, this simplifies to `$g'(K^*) = \\dfrac{\\sigma^2}{2 \\sigma_Y^2}$`. Thus, convergence is guaranteed if `$\\dfrac{\\sigma^2}{2 \\sigma_Y^2}  1$`, which is the same condition `$\\sigma  \\sqrt{2} \\sigma_Y$` derived previously.\n\n3)  4) Numerical Solver Implementation and Computation.\n\nA numerical solver based on the fixed-point iteration formulated above is implemented to compute the corrected `$K_I$` for the given test cases. The algorithm for each parameter set `$(\\sigma, a, \\sigma_Y)$` is as follows:\n- Initialize the iteration count `$k=0$` and the SIF `$K_I^{(0)} = \\sigma \\sqrt{\\pi a}$`.\n- Loop for a maximum of `$10^4$` iterations:\n  - Compute the next SIF estimate: `$K_I^{(k+1)} = \\sigma \\sqrt{\\pi a + \\frac{(K_I^{(k)})^2}{2 \\sigma_Y^2}}$`.\n  - Check for convergence: if `$|K_I^{(k+1)} - K_I^{(k)}|  10^{-12}$`, the iteration has converged. The loop is terminated, and `$K_I^{(k+1)}$` is the result.\n  - Update for the next iteration: `$K_I^{(k)} \\leftarrow K_I^{(k+1)}$`.\n- If the loop completes without convergence, the final computed value of `$K_I$` is returned.\n\nThis algorithm is implemented in Python, using the `numpy` library for mathematical constants and functions. The results for the four test cases are calculated, reported in units of `$MPa\\cdot\\sqrt{\\mathrm{m}}$`, and rounded to `$6$` decimal places as required.\nThe code for this implementation is provided in the final answer block.", "answer": "```python\n# The complete and runnable Python 3 code goes here.\n# Imports must adhere to the specified execution environment.\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef calculate_corrected_k(sigma, a, sigma_y, tol=1e-12, max_iter=10000):\n    \"\"\"\n    Computes the plasticity-corrected Mode I Stress Intensity Factor (K_I)\n    using a fixed-point iteration scheme.\n\n    Args:\n        sigma (float): Remote tensile stress (MPa).\n        a (float): Crack half-length (m).\n        sigma_y (float): Uniaxial yield stress (MPa).\n        tol (float): Absolute tolerance for convergence.\n        max_iter (int): Maximum number of iterations.\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The converged value of K_I (MPa.sqrt(m)).\n    \"\"\"\n    # Check for the validity of the model's physical assumption\n    # sigma  sqrt(2) * sigma_y\n    if sigma = np.sqrt(2) * sigma_y:\n        # This condition leads to a non-physical result (infinite K_I)\n        # in the closed-form solution.
