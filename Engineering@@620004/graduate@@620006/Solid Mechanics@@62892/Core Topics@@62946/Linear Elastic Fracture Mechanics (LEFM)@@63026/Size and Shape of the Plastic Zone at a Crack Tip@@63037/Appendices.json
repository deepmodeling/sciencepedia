It is a standard, well-posed problem in fracture mechanics that tests understanding of first principles. The solution will now be elaborated.\n\nThe solution proceeds by following the steps outlined in the problem statement.\n\nFirst, the relationship between the J-integral, $J$, and the Mode I stress-intensity factor, $K_I$, is established. For a linear elastic material under small-scale yielding, the J-integral is equivalent to the energy release rate, $G$.\n$$J = G$$\nFor plane strain conditions, the energy release rate is related to the stress-intensity factor by:\n$$G = \\frac{1-\\nu^{2}}{E} K_{I}^{2}$$\nCombining these two relations, we obtain the connection between $J$ and $K_I$:\n$$J = \\frac{1-\\nu^{2}}{E} K_{I}^{2}$$\nThis equation can be rearranged to express $K_I^2$, which will be useful for the subsequent derivation:\n$$K_{I}^{2} = \\frac{JE}{1-\\nu^{2}}$$\n\nSecond, we determine the stress state along the crack line, defined by the angle $\\theta = 0$ in a polar coordinate system $(r, \\theta)$ centered at the crack tip. The linear elastic asymptotic stress field for Mode I loading near the crack tip is given by:\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\sigma_{xx} &= \\frac{K_{I}}{\\sqrt{2\\pi r}} \\cos\\left(\\frac{\\theta}{2}\\right) \\left[1 - \\sin\\left(\\frac{\\theta}{2}\\right)\\sin\\left(\\frac{3\\theta}{2}\\right)\\right] \\\\\n\\sigma_{yy} &= \\frac{K_{I}}{\\sqrt{2\\pi r}} \\cos\\left(\\frac{\\theta}{2}\\right) \\left[1 + \\sin\\left(\\frac{\\theta}{2}\\right)\\sin\\left(\\frac{3\\theta}{2}\\right)\\right] \\\\\n\\tau_{xy} &= \\frac{K_{I}}{\\sqrt{2\\pi r}} \\sin\\left(\\frac{\\theta}{2}\\right) \\cos\\left(\\frac{\\theta}{2}\\right)\\cos\\left(\\frac{3\\theta}{2}\\right)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\nEvaluating these expressions at $\\theta = 0$:\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\sigma_{xx}(r, 0) &= \\frac{K_{I}}{\\sqrt{2\\pi r}} \\cos(0) [1 - \\sin(0)\\sin(0)] = \\frac{K_{I}}{\\sqrt{2\\pi r}} \\\\\n\\sigma_{yy}(r, 0) &= \\frac{K_{I}}{\\sqrt{2\\pi r}} \\cos(0) [1 + \\sin(0)\\sin(0)] = \\frac{K_{I}}{\\sqrt{2\\pi r}} \\\\\n\\tau_{xy}(r, 0) &= \\frac{K_{I}}{\\sqrt{2\\pi r}} \\sin(0) \\cos(0)\\cos(0) = 0\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\nUnder plane strain conditions, the strain in the out-of-plane direction is zero, $\\epsilon_{zz} = 0$. From generalized Hooke's law:\n$$\\epsilon_{zz} = \\frac{1}{E}[\\sigma_{zz} - \\nu(\\sigma_{xx} + \\sigma_{yy})] = 0$$\nThis leads to the plane-strain constraint on the out-of-plane stress:\n$$\\sigma_{zz} = \\nu(\\sigma_{xx} + \\sigma_{yy})$$\nSubstituting the stresses for $\\theta=0$:\n$$\\sigma_{zz}(r, 0) = \\nu\\left(\\frac{K_{I}}{\\sqrt{2\\pi r}} + \\frac{K_{I}}{\\sqrt{2\\pi r}}\\right) = 2\\nu \\frac{K_{I}}{\\sqrt{2\\pi r}}$$\nSince $\\tau_{xy}=0$ along the line $\\theta=0$, the stresses $\\sigma_{xx}$, $\\sigma_{yy}$, and $\\sigma_{zz}$ are the principal stresses. Let $\\sigma_H = \\frac{K_{I}}{\\sqrt{2\\pi r}}$. The principal stresses are $\\sigma_{1} = \\sigma_H$, $\\sigma_{2} = \\sigma_H$, and $\\sigma_{3} = 2\\nu\\sigma_H$. Given $\\nu=0.30$, we have $2\\nu=0.60 < 1$, so the principal stress ordering is $\\sigma_I = \\sigma_{II} = \\sigma_H$ and $\\sigma_{III} = 2\\nu\\sigma_H$.\n\nThird, we apply the yield criteria to determine the forward plastic zone length, $l_p$. Yielding is assumed to occur when the effective stress equals the yield strength, $\\sigma_y$.\n\n(a) Using the von Mises yield criterion. The von Mises effective stress, $\\sigma_v$, is defined as:\n$$\\sigma_{v} = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{2}\\left[(\\sigma_{1}-\\sigma_{2})^{2} + (\\sigma_{2}-\\sigma_{3})^{2} + (\\sigma_{3}-\\sigma_{1})^{2}\\right]}$$\nSubstituting the principal stresses for $\\theta=0$:\n$$\\sigma_{v} = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{2}\\left[(\\sigma_H - \\sigma_H)^{2} + (\\sigma_H - 2\\nu\\sigma_H)^{2} + (2\\nu\\sigma_H - \\sigma_H)^{2}\\right]}$$\n$$\\sigma_{v} = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{2}\\left[0 + (\\sigma_H(1-2\\nu))^{2} + (-\\sigma_H(1-2\\nu))^{2}\\right]} = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{2}\\left[2\\sigma_H^{2}(1-2\\nu)^{2}\\right]}$$\n$$\\sigma_{v} = |\\sigma_H(1-2\\nu)|$$\nSince $\\nu=0.30 < 0.5$, the term $1-2\\nu$ is positive. Thus, $\\sigma_{v} = \\sigma_H(1-2\\nu)$.\nYielding occurs at $r=l_p$ where $\\sigma_v = \\sigma_y$:\n$$\\sigma_{y} = (1-2\\nu)\\frac{K_{I}}{\\sqrt{2\\pi l_p}}$$\nSolving for $l_p$:\n$$l_{p} = \\frac{K_{I}^{2}}{2\\pi \\sigma_{y}^{2}}(1-2\\nu)^{2}$$\nSubstituting the expression for $K_I^2$:\n$$l_{p}^{\\text{vM}} = \\frac{1}{2\\pi \\sigma_{y}^{2}} \\left( \\frac{JE}{1-\\nu^{2}} \\right) (1-2\\nu)^{2} = \\frac{JE(1-2\\nu)^{2}}{2\\pi \\sigma_{y}^{2}(1-\\nu^{2})}$$\n\n(b) Using the Tresca yield criterion. The Tresca criterion states that yielding occurs when the maximum shear stress, $\\tau_{\\text{max}}$, reaches a critical value, which for a uniaxial tension test is $\\sigma_y/2$.\n$$\\tau_{\\text{max}} = \\frac{\\sigma_{I} - \\sigma_{III}}{2} = \\frac{\\sigma_y}{2}$$\nThe maximum and minimum principal stresses at $\\theta=0$ are $\\sigma_I = \\sigma_H$ and $\\sigma_{III} = 2\\nu\\sigma_H$.\n$$\\tau_{\\text{max}} = \\frac{\\sigma_H - 2\\nu\\sigma_H}{2} = \\frac{\\sigma_H(1-2\\nu)}{2}$$\nSetting this equal to the yield condition at $r=l_p$:\n$$\\frac{\\sigma_H(1-2\\nu)}{2} = \\frac{\\sigma_y}{2} \\implies \\sigma_H(1-2\\nu) = \\sigma_y$$\nSubstituting for $\\sigma_H$ at $r=l_p$:\n$$\\frac{K_{I}}{\\sqrt{2\\pi l_p}}(1-2\\nu) = \\sigma_y$$\nThis is identical to the equation derived from the von Mises criterion. Therefore, the expression for $l_p$ is the same:\n$$l_{p}^{\\text{Tresca}} = \\frac{JE(1-2\\nu)^{2}}{2\\pi \\sigma_{y}^{2}(1-\\nu^{2})}$$\n\nFourth, we evaluate the numerical value of $l_p$.\nGiven:\n$J = 2.50 \\times 10^{4}\\ \\mathrm{N/m}$\n$E = 2.10 \\times 10^{11}\\ \\mathrm{Pa}$\n$\\nu = 0.30$\n$\\sigma_{y} = 6.00 \\times 10^{8}\\ \\mathrm{Pa}$\n\nWe calculate the components of the expression for $l_p$:\n$1-\\nu^2 = 1 - (0.30)^2 = 1 - 0.09 = 0.91$\n$(1-2\\nu)^2 = (1 - 2 \\times 0.30)^2 = (1 - 0.60)^2 = (0.40)^2 = 0.16$\n$\\sigma_y^2 = (6.00 \\times 10^8)^2 = 3.60 \\times 10^{17}\\ \\mathrm{Pa}^2$\n\nSubstituting these values into the derived formula for $l_p$:\n$$l_p = \\frac{(2.50 \\times 10^{4}) (2.10 \\times 10^{11}) (0.16)}{2\\pi (3.60 \\times 10^{17}) (0.91)}$$\n$$l_p = \\frac{8.40 \\times 10^{14}}{2.0584 \\times 10^{18}}\\ \\mathrm{m} \\approx 4.0808 \\times 10^{-4}\\ \\mathrm{m}$$\nIn millimeters, this is $l_p \\approx 0.40808\\ \\mathrm{mm}$.\nRounding to three significant figures as requested, the forward plastic zone length is $0.408\\ \\mathrm{mm}$.\n\nFinally, a comment on the sensitivity to the choice of yield criterion. For the specific stress state on the forward crack line ($\\theta=0$) under plane strain, the principal stresses are related by $\\sigma_1 = \\sigma_2$ and $\\sigma_3 = 2\\nu \\sigma_1$. For this particular biaxial state, the von Mises and Tresca yield loci coincide. Both criteria reduce to the same yield condition: $(\\sigma_1 - \\sigma_3) = \\sigma_y$. Consequently, the prediction for the extent of the plastic zone directly ahead of the crack tip, $l_p$, is identical for both criteria. This equivalence is a special condition and does not hold for other directions ($\\theta \\ne 0$). Away from the line of symmetry, the principal stress states are different, and the shapes of the overall plastic zones predicted by von Mises (a smaller, 'bean' shape) and Tresca (a larger, more extended shape) are distinct. The identity of the criteria along $\\theta=0$ is thus a specific consequence of the high level of stress triaxiality and the resulting principal stress state in that location.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{0.408}\n$$", "id": "2685358"}, {"introduction": "The size and shape of the plastic zone are not determined by the applied load alone; they are critically dependent on the level of stress triaxiality, or \"constraint.\" This practice provides a clear and powerful illustration of this principle by comparing the plastic zone size in two different scenarios: plane stress, typical of a thin sheet or at a free surface, and plane strain, found in the interior of a thick plate [@problem_id:2685434].

The Drucker–Prager, tension–compression asymmetric case yields $r_p^{+}\\approx 0.374\\,\\mathrm{mm}$, which is larger by a factor of about $4.86$. The physical reason is that ahead of the crack tip the hydrostatic stress $I_10$ is tensile; for a material stronger in compression than tension ($\\sigma_c\\sigma_t$), the Drucker–Prager parameter $\\alpha0$, making the term $\\alpha I_1$ positive and thereby promoting yield at a lower deviatoric stress. This reduces $S_{\\mathrm{y}}$ and enlarges the forward plastic zone. Conversely, if $\\sigma_c\\sigma_t$ then $\\alpha0$, which would suppress yield in hydrostatic tension and shrink the forward plastic zone relative to the symmetric case.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.374}$$", "id": "2685382"}]}
