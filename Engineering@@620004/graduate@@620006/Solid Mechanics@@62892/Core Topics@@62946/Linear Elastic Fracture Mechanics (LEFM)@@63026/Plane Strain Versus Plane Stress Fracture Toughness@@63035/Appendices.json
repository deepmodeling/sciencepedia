The provided material properties, $\\sigma_{y}=800\\,\\text{MPa}$ and $K_{Ic}=50\\,\\text{MPa}\\sqrt{\\text{m}}$, are physically realistic for high-strength engineering alloys. The problem is well-posed, self-contained, and objective. It provides all necessary information to apply the established criterion for a valid $K_{Ic}$ measurement. No contradictions, ambiguities, or factual inaccuracies are present.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. A complete solution will be provided.\n\n**Solution Derivation**\nThe fundamental premise of linear elastic fracture mechanics (LEFM) is that the plastic deformation at the crack tip is confined to a zone that is small compared to the overall dimensions of the specimen and the crack length. This is the condition of \"small-scale yielding.\"\n\nThe state of stress at the crack tip dictates the fracture behavior. A thin specimen allows for through-thickness contraction, leading to a state of plane stress ($\\sigma_{zz} \\approx 0$). A thick specimen constrains this out-of-plane deformation, inducing a triaxial state of stress near the crack tip where $\\sigma_{zz} \\approx \\nu(\\sigma_{xx}+\\sigma_{yy})$. This is a state of plane strain ($\\epsilon_{zz} = 0$). This triaxial stress state elevates the local stress required for yielding and reduces the size of the plastic zone, promoting brittle fracture.\n\nThe plane-strain fracture toughness, $K_{Ic}$, is considered a true material property, independent of specimen geometry, provided that plane-strain conditions dominate at fracture. To ensure this, standardized testing procedures, such as ASTM E399, impose a minimum requirement on the specimen thickness, $B$.\n\nThe size of the plastic zone, $r_p$, ahead of the crack tip can be estimated. For plane stress conditions, the radius of the plastic zone is approximated by the Irwin model as:\n$$ r_p \\approx \\frac{1}{2\\pi} \\left( \\frac{K_I}{\\sigma_y} \\right)^2 $$\nFor a measurement to be considered a valid $K_{Ic}$, the specimen thickness $B$ (and also the crack length $a$) must be significantly larger than the plastic zone size to ensure through-thickness constraint. The empirically established criterion for ensuring dominant plane-strain conditions is:\n$$ B \\geq 2.5 \\left( \\frac{K_{Ic}}{\\sigma_y} \\right)^2 $$\nThis requirement ensures that the plastic zone size is a small fraction of the specimen thickness, thereby maintaining the triaxial constraint necessary for a plane-strain condition.\n\nThe problem asks for the minimum required specimen thickness, $B_{min}$, for the given material properties. We use the limiting case of the inequality:\n$$ B_{min} = 2.5 \\left( \\frac{K_{Ic}}{\\sigma_y} \\right)^2 $$\nWe are given the values:\n- $K_{Ic} = 50\\,\\text{MPa}\\sqrt{\\text{m}}$\n- $\\sigma_y = 800\\,\\text{MPa}$\n\nSubstituting these values into the equation:\n$$ B_{min} = 2.5 \\left( \\frac{50\\,\\text{MPa}\\sqrt{\\text{m}}}{800\\,\\text{MPa}} \\right)^2 $$\nThe units $\\text{MPa}$ cancel out, leaving the result in meters:\n$$ B_{min} = 2.5 \\left( \\frac{50}{800} \\right)^2 \\text{m} $$\n$$ B_{min} = 2.5 \\left( \\frac{1}{16} \\right)^2 \\text{m} $$\n$$ B_{min} = 2.5 \\left( \\frac{1}{256} \\right) \\text{m} $$\n$$ B_{min} \\approx 0.009765625\\,\\text{m} $$\nThe problem requires the answer to be expressed in millimeters.

The von Mises criterion is expressed in terms of principal stresses ($\\sigma_1, \\sigma_2, \\sigma_3$) as:\n$$ \\sigma_v = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{2}\\left[(\\sigma_1 - \\sigma_2)^2 + (\\sigma_2 - \\sigma_3)^2 + (\\sigma_3 - \\sigma_1)^2\\right]} = \\sigma_y $$\n\nWe now derive the plastic zone radius for each case by evaluating the yield condition at $\\theta=0$.\n\n**1.

However, the present derivation adheres strictly to finding the location where the elastic solution first predicts yield. We will proceed with this directly derived result.\n\n**2. Plane Strain Condition ($\\epsilon_{zz} = 0$)**\nFor plane strain, the out-of-plane stress at $\\theta=0$ is $\\sigma_{zz} = \\nu(\\sigma_{xx} + \\sigma_{yy}) = 2\\nu\\sigma_{yy}$.\nThe principal stresses are $\\sigma_1 = \\sigma_{yy}$, $\\sigma_2 = \\sigma_{xx} = \\sigma_{yy}$, and $\\sigma_3 = \\sigma_{zz} = 2\\nu\\sigma_{yy}$. (Assuming $\\nu < 0.5$, $\\sigma_3$ will be smaller than $\\sigma_1$ and $\\sigma_2$).\nThe von Mises equivalent stress is:\n$$ \\sigma_v = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{2}\\left[(\\sigma_{yy} - \\sigma_{yy})^2 + (\\sigma_{yy} - 2\\nu\\sigma_{yy})^2 + (2\\nu\\sigma_{yy} - \\sigma_{yy})^2\\right]} $$\n$$ \\sigma_v = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{2}\\left[0 + 2\\left(\\sigma_{yy}(1-2\\nu)\\right)^2\\right]} = \\sqrt{\\left(\\sigma_{yy}(1-2\\nu)\\right)^2} = (1-2\\nu)\\sigma_{yy} $$\nsince $1-2\\nu > 0$ for $\\nu=0.3$.\nYielding occurs when $\\sigma_v = \\sigma_y$, which means $(1-2\\nu)\\sigma_{yy} = \\sigma_y$, or $\\sigma_{yy} = \\frac{\\sigma_y}{1-2\\nu}$. The stress required to cause yielding is elevated due to the triaxial stress state.\nWe find the plastic zone radius ahead of the crack, $r_{p}^{(\\text{PE})}$, by setting the LEFM stress equal to this elevated value:\n$$ \\frac{K_I}{\\sqrt{2\\pi r_{p}^{(\\text{PE})}}} = \\frac{\\sigma_y}{1-2\\nu} $$\nSolving for $r_{p}^{(\\text{PE})}$:\n$$ r_{p}^{(\\text{PE})} = \\frac{1}{2\\pi}\\left(\\frac{K_I(1-2\\nu)}{\\sigma_y}\\right)^2 = r_{p}^{(\\text{PS})}(1-2\\nu)^2 $$\n\nNow, we evaluate these quantities using the given data.\nThe term $\\left(\\frac{K_I}{\\sigma_y}\\right)^2$ is:\n$$ \\left(\\frac{K_I}{\\sigma_y}\\right)^2 = \\left(\\frac{40 \\text{ MPa}\\sqrt{\\text{m}}}{600 \\text{ MPa}}\\right)^2 = \\left(\\frac{1}{15}\\right)^2 \\text{m} = \\frac{1}{225} \\text{ m} $$\nThe plane stress plastic zone size is:\n$$ r_{p}^{(\\text{PS})} = \\frac{1}{2\\pi}\\left(\\frac{1}{225}\\right) \\text{ m} = \\frac{1}{450\\pi} \\text{ m} \\approx 0.00070736 \\text{ m} \\approx 0.707 \\text{ mm} $$\nThe plane strain plastic zone size is:\n$$ r_{p}^{(\\text{PE})} = r_{p}^{(\\text{PS})}(1 - 2 \\times 0.30)^2 = r_{p}^{(\\text{PS})}(0.4)^2 = 0.16 \\times r_{p}^{(\\text{PS})} $$\n$$ r_{p}^{(\\text{PE})} \\approx 0.16 \\times 0.707 \\text{ mm} \\approx 0.113 \\text{ mm} $$\n\n**Discussion**\nThe calculated plane stress plastic zone size ($r_{p}^{(\\text{PS})} \\approx 0.707 \\text{ mm}$) and plane strain plastic zone size ($r_{p}^{(\\text{PE})} \\approx 0.113 \\text{ mm}$) are both significantly smaller than the specimen thickness $B=8 \\text{ mm}$.\nAt the free surfaces of the specimen (top and bottom), the condition is plane stress ($\\sigma_{zz}=0$). In the interior, at the mid-plane, the surrounding material constrains out-of-plane deformation, enforcing a condition that approaches plane strain ($\\epsilon_{zz} \\approx 0$). Because the estimated plastic zone sizes are small relative to the thickness, the plastic zone is well-contained within the bulk of the material. This containment effect promotes a high level of stress triaxiality at the mid-plane. Therefore, a state approximating **plane strain** is more likely to prevail at the specimen mid-plane.\n\nTo assess whether the conditions for a valid plane strain fracture toughness ($K_{Ic}$) measurement are met, we use the criterion from ASTM standard E399. This standard requires that the specimen dimensions be large enough to ensure small-scale yielding under dominant plane strain conditions. The requirement is:\n$$ B \\ge 2.5 \\left(\\frac{K_I}{\\sigma_y}\\right)^2 $$\nUsing the given values:\n$$ 2.5 \\left(\\frac{K_I}{\\sigma_y}\\right)^2 = 2.5 \\times \\frac{1}{225} \\text{ m} = \\frac{1}{90} \\text{ m} \\approx 0.0111 \\text{ m} = 11.1 \\text{ mm} $$\nThe criterion demands a specimen thickness of at least $11.1 \\text{ mm}$. The actual thickness is $B = 8 \\text{ mm}$. Since $8 \\text{ mm} < 11.1 \\text{ mm}$, the thickness is insufficient. The conditions for a valid plane strain fracture toughness measurement are **not met** for the given load level.\n\nFinally, we compute the required dimensionless ratio $r_{p}^{(\\text{PS})}/B$:\n$$ \\frac{r_{p}^{(\\text{PS})}}{B} = \\frac{\\frac{1}{450\\pi} \\text{ m}}{0.008 \\text{ m}} = \\frac{1}{450\\pi \\times 0.008} = \\frac{1}{3.6\\pi} \\approx 0.0884194 $$\nRounding to four significant figures, the result is $0.08842$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{0.08842}\n$$", "id": "2669819"}, {"introduction": "Finally, we address the practical consequences of failing to meet the plane-strain criteria.
