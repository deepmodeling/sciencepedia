This first practice focuses on the critical procedure for calculating the $J$-integral from a load-displacement record, which is the cornerstone of elastic-plastic fracture toughness evaluation. By working through the standard methodology, you will solidify your understanding of how to partition the total energy into its elastic and plastic components, a fundamental skill for any materials testing engineer [@problem_id:2643094].", "problem": "A single-edge bend specimen in three-point bending is tested under quasi-static, monotonic loading to characterize crack initiation toughness within the framework of Elastic–Plastic Fracture Mechanics (EPFM). The material behavior at the test temperature is elastic–plastic with small-scale yielding, and plane strain is intended. The test produces a high-fidelity record of load $P$ versus a measured displacement $u$ (either load-line displacement or crack-mouth opening displacement) up to a point shortly before any detectable crack extension. The specimen has thickness $B$, width $W$, a fatigue precrack length $a_0$, and the intact ligament ahead of the crack is thus $b_0 = W - a_0$. You are asked to identify, from first principles, the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) E1820-compliant procedure to evaluate the $J$-integral at this load level, including how to partition $J$ into elastic and plastic contributions based on energy, how to define and extract the plastic work term from the load–displacement record, and how geometry enters. Your answer must specify the correct role and physical meaning of the following quantities and how they are obtained: the plastic area $A_{pl}$ under the load–displacement record, the dimensionless geometry factor $\\eta$, the specimen thickness $B$, and the initial ligament $b_0$. It must also make clear how the elastic part is connected to the Stress Intensity Factor (SIF) $K$ through the appropriate modulus for the plane condition.\n\nWhich option most completely and correctly describes this ASTM E1820 procedure for evaluating $J$ at crack initiation?\n\nA. Use energy partition in EPFM so that $J$ is the sum of an elastic contribution derived from linear-elastic fracture mechanics and a plastic contribution derived from plastic work per newly created crack area. The elastic part is $J_{el} = K^2/E'$, where $E' = E/(1-\\nu^2)$ for plane strain or $E' = E$ for plane stress, and $K$ is obtained from $P$ and the single-edge bend geometry via the standard calibration. The plastic part is $J_{pl} = \\eta\\,A_{pl}/(B\\,b_0)$ for crack initiation (no crack advance), with $\\eta$ taken from the ASTM geometry calibration corresponding to whether $u$ is load-line displacement or crack-mouth opening displacement. Here $A_{pl}$ is the plastic area under the measured $P$–$u$ curve up to the analysis point, computed as the total area $\\int_0^{u} P\\,\\mathrm{d}u$ minus the recoverable elastic area $\\tfrac{1}{2} P^2 C$, with the elastic compliance $C$ estimated from the initial linear portion of the $P$–$u$ record (or from the elastic compliance calibration at $a_0$). The thickness $B$ is the specimen thickness to be used in fracture calculations (replaced by the net thickness if side-grooved), and $b_0 = W-a_0$ is the initial ligament. Numerical integration of the recorded $P$–$u$ and a compliance-based elastic correction are used to obtain $A_{pl}$.\n\nB.

The geometry factor $\\eta$ can be set to $1$ because its effects are absorbed in $C$.", "solution": "The problem statement must first be validated for correctness and solvability.\n\n**Step 1: Extract Givens**\n-   Test: Three-point bending of a single-edge bend specimen.\n-   Loading Conditions: Quasi-static, monotonic.\n-   Objective: Characterize crack initiation toughness using Elastic–Plastic Fracture Mechanics (EPFM).\n-   Material State: Elastic–plastic behavior, small-scale yielding, plane strain intended.\n-   Measurement: Load $P$ versus displacement $u$ (load-line or crack-mouth opening) is recorded. The analysis point is just before detectable crack extension.\n-   Geometry: Specimen thickness $B$, width $W$, initial fatigue precrack length $a_0$.\n-   Derived Geometry: Initial ligament length $b_0 = W - a_0$.\n-   Task: Identify the ASTM E1820-compliant procedure for evaluating the $J$-integral at the analysis point, detailing the roles of plastic area $A_{pl}$, geometry factor $\\eta$, thickness $B$, ligament $b_0$, and the connection of the elastic part to the Stress Intensity Factor (SIF) $K$.\n\n**Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens**\nThe problem is scientifically grounded. It describes a standard experimental procedure in the field of fracture mechanics, governed by the established ASTM E1820 standard. All terms—$J$-integral, EPFM, SIF, single-edge bend specimen, load-displacement record, plane strain, $a_0$, $b_0$, $W$, $B$—are standard and well-defined in solid mechanics.\nThe problem is well-posed: it asks for the correct identification of a standardized, unique procedure.\nThe language is objective and technical.\nThe setup is self-contained and free of contradictions. The relationships described are physically and mathematically sound. For instance, the premise of using the $J$-integral for an elastic-plastic material under small-scale yielding conditions is appropriate. The definition $b_0 = W - a_0$ is correct.\nThe problem is not trivial; it requires a detailed understanding of the energy-based approach to EPFM testing.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem statement is valid. It is a precise and standard question from the field of experimental solid mechanics. A solution will be derived from first principles, and each option will be evaluated.\n\n**Derivation of the Solution**\n\nThe $J$-integral, as an elastic-plastic fracture parameter, quantifies the energy available to drive crack extension. The standard engineering practice, codified in ASTM E1820, is to partition $J$ into elastic and plastic components:\n$$J = J_{el} + J_{pl}$$\nThis decomposition is a cornerstone of the measurement procedure.\n\n1.  **Elastic Contribution ($J_{el}$):**\n    Under small-scale yielding, the elastic strain field far from the crack tip is assumed to be characterized by the stress intensity factor, $K$. The elastic portion of the $J$-integral is then equivalent to the linear-elastic energy release rate, $G$. The relationship is:\n    $$J_{el} = G = \\frac{K^2}{E'}$$\n    where $K$ is the Mode I stress intensity factor calculated for the specimen geometry (single-edge bend) at the given load $P$ and crack length $a_0$ using standard calibration formulas found in ASTM standards. $E'$ is the effective elastic modulus. For the specified condition of plane strain, it is given by:\n    $$E' = \\frac{E}{1 - \\nu^2}$$\n    where $E$ is the Young's modulus and $\\nu$ is the Poisson's ratio. Had the condition been plane stress, one would use $E' = E$.\n\n2.  **Plastic Contribution ($J_{pl}$):**\n    The plastic contribution is related to the plastic work done on the specimen. For standard bend and compact tension geometries, a simplified relationship exists between $J_{pl}$ and the plastic area under the load-displacement curve, $A_{pl}$. The formula is:\n    $$J_{pl} = \\frac{\\eta A_{pl}}{B b_0}$$\n    Let us examine the components of this expression:\n    -   $A_{pl}$: This is the plastic work. It is determined from the experimental $P-u$ curve. The total area under the curve up to the final displacement $u$ is the total work done, $A_{tot} = \\int_0^u P(\\tilde{u}) \\, \\mathrm{d}\\tilde{u}$. From this, the elastically stored (and thus recoverable) energy must be subtracted. This elastic energy corresponds to the area of a triangle formed by unloading from the final point $(u, P)$ along a line with the initial elastic compliance $C$. The elastic energy is $\\frac{1}{2} P u_{el} = \\frac{1}{2} P (P C) = \\frac{1}{2} P^2 C$. The compliance $C$ is found from the initial linear slope of the $P-u$ record ($C = u/P$ in the elastic regime) or from a standard formula for the specimen geometry with crack length $a_0$. Therefore, the plastic area is:\n        $$A_{pl} = \\int_0^u P(\\tilde{u}) \\, \\mathrm{d}\\tilde{u} - \\frac{1}{2} P^2 C$$\n    -   $B$: This is the specimen thickness. For a specimen with side grooves, the net thickness at the groove, $B_N$, is used to correctly account for the area over which fracture occurs.\n    -   $b_0$: This is the initial ligament length, $b_0 = W - a_0$. It is the characteristic dimension of the region experiencing intense plastic deformation. The product $B b_0$ represents the initial area of the uncracked ligament. Normalizing the plastic work $A_{pl}$ by this area provides a measure of energy per unit of ligament area.\n    -   $\\eta$: This is a dimensionless geometry factor. It is not a universal constant. It is a function of the specimen type, the $a/W$ ratio, and the type of displacement measured (load-line versus crack-mouth opening). For deeply cracked bend specimens ($a/W \\gtrapprox 0.5$), $\\eta \\approx 2$ for load-line displacement. For other conditions, its value is given by specific formulas or tables in ASTM E1820.\n\nIn summary, the procedure involves numerical integration of the $P-u$ data, a compliance-based correction to find $A_{pl}$, and the use of tabulated geometry functions for $K$ and $\\eta$ to calculate the two components of $J$.\n\n**Option-by-Option Analysis**\n\n**A. Use energy partition in EPFM so that $J$ is the sum of an elastic contribution derived from linear-elastic fracture mechanics and a plastic contribution derived from plastic work per newly created crack area. The elastic part is $J_{el} = K^2/E'$, where $E' = E/(1-\\nu^2)$ for plane strain or $E' = E$ for plane stress, and $K$ is obtained from $P$ and the single-edge bend geometry via the standard calibration. The plastic part is $J_{pl} = \\eta\\,A_{pl}/(B\\,b_0)$ for crack initiation (no crack advance), with $\\eta$ taken from the ASTM geometry calibration corresponding to whether $u$ is load-line displacement or crack-mouth opening displacement.

The thickness $B$ is the specimen thickness to be used in fracture calculations (replaced by the net thickness if side-grooved), and $b_0 = W-a_0$ is the initial ligament. Numerical integration of the recorded $P$–$u$ and a compliance-based elastic correction are used to obtain $A_{pl}$.**\n\nThis option correctly describes every aspect of the ASTM E1820 procedure as derived from first principles.\n-   The decomposition $J=J_{el}+J_{pl}$ is correct.\n-   The formula for $J_{el}$ including the plane strain-corrected modulus $E'$ is correct.\n-   The formula for $J_{pl}$ using $\\eta$, $A_{pl}$, $B$, and $b_0$ is correct.

This exercise delves into the mechanistic basis of the \"crack blunting line,\" a crucial construction used to separate this blunting behavior from the material's actual fracture resistance on a $J$-$R$ curve. Mastering this concept, which links the $J$-integral to the Crack Tip Opening Displacement (CTOD), is essential for accurately determining the initiation toughness from experimental data [@problem_id:2643148].", "problem": "A laboratory is establishing a rising $J$-$R$ curve (the fracture resistance curve plotted as the energy release rate $J$ versus the crack extension $\\Delta a$) for a ductile, power-law hardening metal using a Single-Edge Bend (SE(B)) geometry under monotonic loading.

It is a standard, well-posed problem in solid mechanics that is scientifically sound and objective. The solution process may proceed.\n\n### Derivation of the Blunting Line Criterion\n\nThe derivation proceeds from first principles as requested.\n\n1.  **Relationship between $J$-Integral and CTOD**: For a crack in a ductile material subjected to loading that causes significant plasticity at the tip, the $J$-integral represents the energy flux into the crack tip region. This energy is dissipated primarily through plastic work. The $J$-integral is directly related to the intensity of the crack tip deformation field. A key measure of this deformation is the Crack Tip Opening Displacement (CTOD), denoted $\\delta_t$. From detailed analyses of the Hutchinson-Rice-Rosengren (HRR) singular fields for a power-law hardening material, it is established that $J$ and $\\delta_t$ are proportional:\n    $$J = m \\, \\sigma_{\\text{flow}} \\, \\delta_t$$\n    Here, $\\sigma_{\\text{flow}}$ is a representative flow stress of the material, which characterizes its resistance to plastic deformation. The parameter $m$ is a dimensionless factor that depends on the strain hardening exponent and the state of stress (constraint) at the crack tip. For many practical applications and as a standard approximation for constructing the blunting line, $m$ is taken to be approximately $1$. Thus, we have the fundamental relationship:\n    $$\\delta_t \\approx \\frac{J}{\\sigma_{\\text{flow}}}$$\n\n2.  **Geometric Model of Blunting**: Crack tip blunting is the process by which a sharp crack deforms into a rounded, U-shaped notch before any actual tearing (material separation) occurs. The apparent crack extension, $\\Delta a$, measured by techniques like the elastic unloading compliance method, does not distinguish between true crack growth and this change in geometry. A simple and widely accepted geometric model for a fully blunted tip assumes a semi-circular profile. In this model, the CTOD, $\\delta_t$, corresponds to the diameter of the semicircle at the position of the original crack plane. The \"advance\" of the crack front is modeled as the radius of this semicircle, $\\rho$.\n    Therefore, the relationship between the apparent crack extension due to blunting and the CTOD is:\n    $$\\Delta a = \\rho = \\frac{\\delta_t}{2}$$\n    This factor of $1/2$ is purely geometric, reflecting the fact that the apparent advance is half of the total opening displacement.\n\n3.  **Construction of the Blunting Line**: By substituting the expression for $\\delta_t$ from step 1 into the geometric relation from step 2, we obtain the equation for the blunting line:\n    $$\\Delta a = \\frac{1}{2} \\left( \\frac{J}{\\sigma_{\\text{flow}}} \\right) = \\frac{J}{2 \\, \\sigma_{\\text{flow}}}$$\n    This equation defines the locus of ($J$, $\\Delta a$) points that correspond to pure blunting without any stable crack tearing.\n\n4.  **Definition of Flow Stress ($\\sigma_{\\text{flow}}$)**: For a material that work-hardens, the stress required to sustain plastic flow increases with strain. The blunting process involves significant plastic strains near the crack tip. Therefore, using the initial yield stress, $\\sigma_y$, is insufficient as it ignores hardening. Using the ultimate tensile strength, $\\sigma_u$, is also inappropriate as it represents the peak stress before necking, a level not uniformly attained in the plastic zone. A more representative value is an average stress over the plastic deformation range. The most common and accepted engineering definition for the flow stress in this context is the arithmetic mean of the yield and ultimate tensile strengths:\n    $$\\sigma_{\\text{flow}} = \\frac{\\sigma_y + \\sigma_u}{2}$$\n    This provides a reasonable estimate of the material's average resistance to plastic flow.\n\n5.  **Applicability**: The entire framework relies on the $J$-integral being the single parameter that characterizes the crack tip state. This condition, known as $J$-dominance, holds under small-scale yielding (where the plastic zone is small compared to specimen dimensions) and for certain geometries under large-scale yielding, provided the loading is monotonic.\n\n### Evaluation of Options\n\n**A. The blunting line is $\\Delta a = \\dfrac{J}{2\\,\\sigma_{\\text{flow}}}$, with $\\sigma_{\\text{flow}} = \\dfrac{\\sigma_y + \\sigma_u}{2}$ or an equivalent representative flow stress (e.g., a Ramberg–Osgood reference stress). Mechanistic basis: for early monotonic blunting without true crack advance, $J$ is work-conjugate to CTOD $\\delta$ so that $\\delta \\approx \\dfrac{J}{\\sigma_{\\text{flow}}}$, and the apparent extension measured by standard compliance methods is $\\Delta a \\approx \\dfrac{\\delta}{2}$, giving the stated line. Valid under $J$-dominant, small-scale yielding conditions.**\n\n- **Analysis**: This option correctly states the equation $\\Delta a = J/(2\\sigma_{\\text{flow}})$, which matches our derivation. It provides a correct and standard definition for $\\sigma_{\\text{flow}}$. Its mechanistic justification, combining the relationship $\\delta \\approx J/\\sigma_{\\text{flow}}$ with the geometric model $\\Delta a \\approx \\delta/2$, is precisely the correct physical reasoning. It also correctly specifies the conditions of validity ($J$-dominance).\n- **Verdict**: Correct.\n\n**B. The blunting line is $\\Delta a = \\dfrac{J}{\\sigma_y}$, taking $\\sigma_{\\text{flow}} = \\sigma_y$ on the grounds that blunting is governed by initial yielding; the factor of $2$ is unnecessary because both crack flanks contribute additively to extension. This holds broadly regardless of hardening or constraint.**\n\n- **Analysis**: This option is incorrect on multiple grounds. First, it omits the geometric factor of $2$ in the denominator. The justification that the factor is \"unnecessary\" is physically baseless. Second, it uses $\\sigma_y$ instead of $\\sigma_{\\text{flow}}$, which is an inaccurate approximation for a work-hardening material. Third, the claim that it holds regardless of hardening or constraint is false; these effects are of primary importance.\n- **Verdict**: Incorrect.\n\n**C. The blunting line is $\\Delta a = \\dfrac{2J}{\\sigma_{\\text{flow}}}$ because two crack flanks move symmetrically, doubling the apparent extension relative to CTOD; $\\sigma_{\\text{flow}}$ may be taken as $\\dfrac{\\sigma_y + \\sigma_u}{2}$.**\n\n- **Analysis**: This option has the factor of $2$ in the numerator, resulting in an equation that is wrong by a factor of $4$. The justification that symmetric flank movement \"doubles\" the apparent extension relative to CTOD is a complete misunderstanding of the geometry. The CTOD *is* the total opening, and the apparent extension is approximately half of it.\n- **Verdict**: Incorrect.\n\n**D. The blunting line is $\\Delta a = \\dfrac{J}{\\sigma_u}$ because the ultimate tensile strength $\\sigma_u$ limits the ligament traction during blunting; this avoids ambiguity in defining $\\sigma_{\\text{flow}}$ and is valid whenever the loading is monotonic.**\n\n- **Analysis**: This option is incorrect. It omits the geometric factor of $2$. While using $\\sigma_u$ might seem to \"avoid ambiguity,\" it is not the most physically representative stress; a flow stress is more appropriate. The claim of validity \"whenever the loading is monotonic\" is overly broad and ignores the crucial requirement of $J$-dominance.\n- **Verdict**: Incorrect.\n\n**E. No blunting line should be used; early $J$-$\\Delta a$ points must be included because the measurement of $\\Delta a$ already accounts for blunting through compliance, and excluding them biases the $J$-$R$ fit at larger $\\Delta a$.**\n\n- **Analysis**: This statement is fundamentally wrong and contradicts the entire purpose of modern fracture toughness testing procedures for ductile materials. The blunting line is essential to distinguish apparent crack extension due to plastic deformation from true crack extension due to material separation (tearing). Including blunting-only data in a fit intended to characterize tearing resistance would contaminate the result and lead to a non-physical characterization of the material's fracture properties. The procedure is designed specifically to *avoid* the bias this option claims would be introduced by exclusion.\n- **Verdict**: Incorrect.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2643148"}, {"introduction": "A measured fracture toughness value, denoted $J_Q$, is only a candidate material property until it is validated.

This task bridges the gap between theoretical concepts of crack-tip constraint and the practical reality of experimental design and data qualification [@problem_id:2643168].", "problem": "A single-specimen elastic unloading compliance resistance curve (R-curve) test following American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) International practice on a metallic alloy produced a provisional J-integral value of $J_{Q}$ at the intersection of the fitted crack growth curve and the blunting line. The specimen is a single-edge bend geometry with thickness $B$ and initial net ligament $b_{0}$. The measured material strengths are the $0.2$ percent offset yield strength $\\sigma_{YS}$ and the ultimate tensile strength $\\sigma_{UTS}$, and the representative flow stress for validity assessment is defined by $\\sigma_{\\text{flow}}=\\left(\\sigma_{YS}+\\sigma_{UTS}\\right)/2$.

If not, assume the geometry must be scaled uniformly so that all in-plane and out-of-plane linear dimensions are multiplied by a single factor $s$ while keeping dimensionless geometry ratios unchanged. Compute the minimum $s$ that will satisfy the size-validity requirements simultaneously for both $B$ and $b_{0}$. Report $s$ as a pure number rounded to four significant figures.", "solution": "The problem presented is a straightforward application of the size-validity criteria stipulated by the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) standard E1820 for determining the plane-strain fracture toughness, $J_{Ic}$. The provisional value $J_{Q}$ can only be qualified as a geometry-independent material property $J_{Ic}$ if the specimen dimensions are sufficiently large to ensure a state of plane-strain dominance at the crack front.\n\nFirst, we must calculate the representative flow stress, $\\sigma_{\\text{flow}}$, which is defined for validity assessment in the problem statement. Using the provided yield strength $\\sigma_{YS}$ and ultimate tensile strength $\\sigma_{UTS}$, we have:\n$$\n\\sigma_{\\text{flow}} = \\frac{\\sigma_{YS} + \\sigma_{UTS}}{2}\n$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$\n\\sigma_{\\text{flow}} = \\frac{620\\ \\mathrm{MPa} + 780\\ \\mathrm{MPa}}{2} = \\frac{1400\\ \\mathrm{MPa}}{2} = 700\\ \\mathrm{MPa}\n$$\nThis is equivalent to $700 \\times 10^{6}\\ \\mathrm{N/m^{2}}$. The provisional toughness is given as $J_{Q} = 165\\ \\mathrm{kJ/m^{2}}$, which must be expressed in base units for consistency: $J_{Q} = 165 \\times 10^{3}\\ \\mathrm{J/m^{2}} = 165 \\times 10^{3}\\ \\mathrm{N/m}$.\n\nThe ASTM E1820 standard dictates that for $J_{Q}$ to be considered a valid $J_{Ic}$, the characteristic dimensions of the specimen—namely the thickness $B$ and the initial ligament $b_{0}$—must both satisfy a size requirement. This requirement ensures that the plastic zone at the crack tip is small compared to the specimen dimensions, thereby maintaining high constraint. The condition is:\n$$\nB, b_{0} > 25 \\frac{J_{Q}}{\\sigma_{\\text{flow}}}\n$$\nLet us compute the minimum required dimension, which we denote as $d_{\\text{min}}$:\n$$\nd_{\\text{min}} = 25 \\frac{J_{Q}}{\\sigma_{\\text{flow}}} = 25 \\frac{165 \\times 10^{3}\\ \\mathrm{N/m}}{700 \\times 10^{6}\\ \\mathrm{N/m^{2}}}\n$$\n$$\nd_{\\text{min}} = 25 \\times \\frac{165}{700} \\times 10^{-3}\\ \\mathrm{m} = \\frac{4125}{700} \\times 10^{-3}\\ \\mathrm{m} \\approx 5.892857 \\times 10^{-3}\\ \\mathrm{m}\n$$\nConverting this to millimeters gives $d_{\\text{min}} \\approx 5.892857\\ \\mathrm{mm}$.\n\nNow we compare this requirement with the actual specimen dimensions:\n- Specimen thickness: $B = 4.80\\ \\mathrm{mm}$\n- Initial ligament: $b_{0} = 5.60\\ \\mathrm{mm}$\n\nThe validity checks are:\n1. Is $B > d_{\\text{min}}$? Is $4.80\\ \\mathrm{mm} > 5.892857\\ \\mathrm{mm}$? This is false.\n2. Is $b_{0} > d_{\\text{min}}$? Is $5.60\\ \\mathrm{mm} > 5.892857\\ \\mathrm{mm}$? This is also false.\n\nSince both dimensions fail to meet the size requirement, the value $J_{Q} = 165\\ \\mathrm{kJ/m^{2}}$ cannot be promoted to a valid plane-strain fracture toughness $J_{Ic}$. The test result is invalid due to insufficient specimen size.\n\nThe second part of the problem requires finding a minimum uniform scaling factor $s$ such that a geometrically similar, larger specimen would produce a valid result. The new dimensions, $B' = sB$ and $b_{0}' = sb_{0}$, must satisfy the validity criteria.\nThe conditions become:\n$$\nsB > 25 \\frac{J_{Q}}{\\sigma_{\\text{flow}}}\n$$\n$$\nsb_{0} > 25 \\frac{J_{Q}}{\\sigma_{\\text{flow}}}\n$$\nThese inequalities can be rewritten for $s$:\n$$\ns > \\frac{d_{\\text{min}}}{B}\n$$\n$$\ns > \\frac{d_{\\text{min}}}{b_{0}}\n$$\nTo satisfy both conditions simultaneously, $s$ must be greater than the maximum of the two required lower bounds:\n$$\ns > \\max\\left(\\frac{d_{\\text{min}}}{B}, \\frac{d_{\\text{min}}}{b_{0}}\\right)\n$$\nThis is equivalent to:\n$$\ns > \\frac{d_{\\text{min}}}{\\min(B, b_{0})}\n$$\nThe smaller of the two initial dimensions is $B = 4.80\\ \\mathrm{mm}$.
