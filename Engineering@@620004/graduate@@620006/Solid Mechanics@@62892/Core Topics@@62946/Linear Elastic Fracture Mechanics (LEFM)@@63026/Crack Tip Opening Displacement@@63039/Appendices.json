The derivation is constrained to rely upon the principle of energy conservation and standard definitions from linear elastic fracture mechanics (LEFM) and cohesive zone models. The most direct and rigorous method that satisfies these constraints is the use of the path-independent J-integral. The J-integral, a fundamental concept in fracture mechanics, quantifies the energy release rate for a crack in an elastic-plastic material. Its path-independence allows us to relate the far-field loading conditions to the near-tip deformation and fracture processes.\n\nFirst, we evaluate the J-integral using a contour, $\\Gamma$, taken far from the crack tip region. The problem states the assumption of small-scale yielding (SSY). Under this assumption, the material response far from the crack is dominated by the linear elastic solution corresponding to a crack of length $2a$. For a through-thickness crack of length $2a$ in an infinite plate under a remote uniform tensile stress $\\sigma$, the mode I stress intensity factor, $K_I$, is given by the standard LEFM expression:\n$$\nK_I = \\sigma \\sqrt{\\pi a}\n$$\nFor a linear elastic material, the J-integral is equivalent to the elastic energy release rate, $G$. The relationship between $J$, $G$, and $K_I$ is given by:\n$$\nJ = G = \\frac{K_I^2}{E'}\n$$\nwhere $E'$ is the effective elastic modulus, defined as $E' = E$ for plane stress and $E' = E/(1-\\nu^2)$ for plane strain. Substituting the expression for $K_I$ into this relation yields the far-field value of the J-integral:\n$$\nJ = \\frac{(\\sigma \\sqrt{\\pi a})^2}{E'} = \\frac{\\pi \\sigma^2 a}{E'}\n$$\nThis expression represents the energy available from the global elastic strain field for a unit extension of the crack.\n\nNext, we evaluate the J-integral using a contour that shrinks down to the crack faces within the plastic or cohesive zone. For a cohesive zone model, the J-integral is interpreted as the work of separation required to create a unit area of new crack surface. This work is performed by the cohesive tractions acting over the crack opening displacements within the process zone ahead of the physical crack tip. In the Dugdale model, the material is idealized as elastic-perfectly plastic, which is represented by a cohesive zone of length $r_p$ ahead of the crack tip at $x=a$. Within this zone, a uniform closing traction equal to the material's yield strength, $\\sigma_Y$, acts on the crack faces.\n\nThe work of separation per unit area of crack advance is formally given by the integral of the traction-separation law, $T(w)$, with respect to the opening displacement, $w$:\n$$\nJ = \\int_{0}^{\\delta_{c}} T(w) \\, dw\n$$\nIn the Dugdale model, the traction is constant, $T(w) = \\sigma_Y$, for any opening $w > 0$. The COD at the original physical crack tip ($x=a$) is defined as $\\delta$. The energy dissipated per unit area of crack advance is therefore the product of the constant cohesive stress, $\\sigma_Y$, and the total opening displacement at the point of initial separation, which is $\\delta$. This provides a direct relationship between the J-integral and the CTOD:\n$$\nJ = \\sigma_Y \\delta\n$$\nThis expression represents the energy dissipated by plastic deformation within the strip-yield zone per unit extension of the crack.\n\nThe path-independence of the J-integral is a statement of energy conservation: the energy released from the far-field must be equal to the energy consumed by the dissipative processes at the crack tip.

The loading is monotonic and quasi-static, and small-scale yielding prevails so that the far-field loading can be characterized by the path-independent $J$-integral $J$. The constitutive response in plane is well represented by a Ramberg–Osgood relation with reference (0.2% offset) yield stress $\\sigma_{0}$, Young’s modulus $E$, Poisson’s ratio $\\nu$, and hardening exponent $n$, with the power-law plasticity dominating near the crack tip once $|\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}|$ exceeds $\\sigma_{0}$. The Crack Tip Opening Displacement (CTOD), denoted $\\delta$, is defined as the relative displacement of the crack flanks at the physical crack tip along the crack plane.\n\nYou are told that, for power-law plasticity in the Hutchinson–Rice–Rosengren self-similar near-tip fields, the scalar amplitude linking the near-tip crack opening profile to $J/\\sigma_{0}$ is a dimensionless number that depends on the level of constraint.

It is well-posed, objective, and self-contained. The provided data are physically realistic for a metallic material. The definition of CTOD \"at the physical crack tip\" is an idealization, but standard in the context of deriving scaling relations from asymptotic fields. The problem is therefore deemed valid.\n\nThe solution proceeds in three parts as requested: derivation of the scaling relation, explanation of the physical difference between plane stress and plane strain, and numerical computation.\n\nFirst, I will derive the scaling relationship for the Crack Tip Opening Displacement, $\\delta$.\nThe problem is situated in the small-scale yielding regime, where the plastic zone at the crack tip is small compared to other geometric dimensions. The behavior of this zone is governed by the far-field loading, which is uniquely characterized by the $J$-integral. The problem states that power-law plasticity dominates near the crack tip. This implies that the elastic properties of the material, such as the Young's modulus $E$, are not primary parameters in determining the structure and magnitude of the deformation field deep within the plastic zone. The dominant physical quantities are those that describe the load on the plastic zone, $J$, and the material's resistance to plastic flow, characterized by the yield stress $\\sigma_{0}$. Other parameters like the hardening exponent $n$ and the Ramberg-Osgood coefficient $\\alpha$ will be absorbed into a dimensionless proportionality constant.\n\nThe CTOD, $\\delta$, is a measure of deformation and has the dimension of length, $[L]$. We must construct a quantity with this dimension from the governing parameters.\nThe $J$-integral, representing energy release rate per unit crack extension, has units of energy per area, or force per length. The dimensions are $[J] = [F L^{-1}]$.\nThe yield stress, $\\sigma_{0}$, has dimensions of pressure, or force per area. The dimensions are $[\\sigma_{0}] = [F L^{-2}]$.\n\nWe postulate a relationship of the form $\\delta \\propto J^a \\sigma_0^b$, where $a$ and $b$ are exponents to be determined. The dimensional homogeneity requires:\n$$ [L^1] = [F L^{-1}]^a [F L^{-2}]^b = F^{a+b} L^{-a-2b} $$\nFor this equation to be valid, the exponents of the fundamental dimensions of force ($F$) and length ($L$) on both sides must be equal.\nEquating exponents for $F$:\n$$ a + b = 0 \\implies b = -a $$\nEquating exponents for $L$:\n$$ -a - 2b = 1 $$\nSubstituting $b = -a$ into the second equation gives:\n$$ -a - 2(-a) = 1 \\implies -a + 2a = 1 \\implies a = 1 $$\nConsequently, $b = -1$.\nThis analysis rigorously demonstrates that the only combination of $J$ and $\\sigma_0$ that yields a quantity with the dimension of length is $J/\\sigma_0$. Therefore, the scaling relation for CTOD must be:\n$$ \\delta = d_n \\frac{J}{\\sigma_0} $$\nHere, $d_n$ is a dimensionless factor that depends on the hardening exponent $n$ and the state of stress (i.e., plane stress or plane strain), as these affect the detailed structure of the near-tip fields. This derivation confirms the premise given in the problem statement. The symbols $c_{\\mathrm{ps}}$ and $c_{\\mathrm{pe}}$ are a special case of $d_n$ for $n=10$.\n\nSecond, I will explain why the proportionality constant differs between plane stress and plane strain.\nThe difference arises from the level of stress triaxiality, or constraint, at the crack tip.\n- **Plane Strain**: This condition, where strain in the thickness direction is zero ($\\epsilon_{zz}=0$), prevails in the interior of thick specimens. To prevent through-thickness contraction, a significant tensile stress, $\\sigma_{zz}$, develops. This leads to a state of high stress triaxiality, quantified by a high ratio of hydrostatic stress $\\sigma_m = (\\sigma_{kk})/3$ to equivalent stress $\\sigma_e$. Plastic flow is governed by the equivalent stress. In a state of high triaxiality, the principal stresses are all large and tensile, which means the in-plane stresses ($\\sigma_{xx}$, $\\sigma_{yy}$) must attain very high values before the differences between them are large enough for the equivalent stress to reach the material's flow stress. This high triaxiality suppresses plastic deformation. The resulting plastic zone is small and confined.\n- **Plane Stress**: This condition, where the through-thickness stress is zero ($\\sigma_{zz}=0$), exists at the free surfaces or in thin specimens. The absence of $\\sigma_{zz}$ results in low stress triaxiality. Yielding is less constrained and occurs at lower levels of in-plane stress. This promotes large-scale plastic deformation. The resulting plastic zone is much larger than in plane strain for the same applied $J$.\n- **Conclusion on CTOD**: The CTOD, $\\delta$, is a direct physical measure of the amount of plastic straining and crack tip blunting. Since plane stress conditions facilitate more extensive plastic flow, a larger crack opening displacement is generated for a given loading level $J$. Conversely, the high constraint of plane strain stifles plastic flow, resulting in a smaller opening. Therefore, for the same $J$ and $\\sigma_0$, we must have $\\delta_{\\mathrm{ps}} > \\delta_{\\mathrm{pe}}$, which is consistent with the given values $c_{\\mathrm{ps}} = 0.78 > c_{\\mathrm{pe}} = 0.44$.\n\nThird, I will compute the numerical difference $\\Delta\\delta = \\delta_{\\mathrm{ps}} - \\delta_{\\mathrm{pe}}$.\nThe relations for the CTOD in plane stress and plane strain are:\n$$ \\delta_{\\mathrm{ps}} = c_{\\mathrm{ps}} \\frac{J}{\\sigma_0} $$\n$$ \\delta_{\\mathrm{pe}} = c_{\\mathrm{pe}} \\frac{J}{\\sigma_0} $$\nThe difference is:\n$$ \\Delta\\delta = \\delta_{\\mathrm{ps}} - \\delta_{\\mathrm{pe}} = (c_{\\mathrm{ps}} - c_{\\mathrm{pe}}) \\frac{J}{\\sigma_0} $$\nThe provided numerical values are:\n$J = 1.20 \\times 10^{5}$ N/m\n$\\sigma_{0} = 400$ MPa $= 400 \\times 10^{6}$ N/m$^2$\n$c_{\\mathrm{ps}} = 0.78$\n$c_{\\mathrm{pe}} = 0.44$\n\nFirst, I compute the characteristic length scale $J/\\sigma_0$:\n$$ \\frac{J}{\\sigma_0} = \\frac{1.20 \\times 10^5 \\text{ N/m}}{400 \\times 10^6 \\text{ N/m}^2} = \\frac{1.20 \\times 10^5}{4.00 \\times 10^8} \\text{ m} = 0.300 \\times 10^{-3} \\text{ m} $$\nNow, I substitute the values into the expression for $\\Delta\\delta$:\n$$ \\Delta\\delta = (0.78 - 0.44) \\times (0.300 \\times 10^{-3} \\text{ m}) $$\n$$ \\Delta\\delta = 0.34 \\times 0.300 \\times 10^{-3} \\text{ m} $$\n$$ \\Delta\\delta = 0.102 \\times 10^{-3} \\text{ m} $$\nThe problem requires the answer to be expressed in millimeters.

You may also use classical small-scale yielding estimates to assess the size of the plastic zone.\n\nStarting from the definitions of the stress intensity factor, the path-independent energy contour integral introduced by James Rice (J-integral), and the notion that the crack tip opening displacement (CTOD) must be governed by the actual near-tip singular field appropriate to the material behavior, analyze the limits in which a $K$-based CTOD correlation is expected to fail for this specimen and how to transition to a framework that remains valid. Select all statements that are scientifically correct and justified by first principles for the given conditions.\n\nA. Based on the plastic zone size under plane strain relative to the ligament, the small-scale yielding assumption is violated; therefore the proportionality of CTOD to a function of $K$ from linear elasticity is not geometry- or constraint-independent. One should transition to a J-integral (J)-based characterization, computing $J$ from the area under the load–displacement curve with an appropriate specimen-dependent factor, and then relate CTOD to $J$ using the Hutchinson–Rice–Rosengren (HRR) near-tip asymptotic field for a power-law hardening solid. If high fidelity is required, include a constraint correction (e.g., via a $Q$-parameter or $T$-stress).\n\nB. The $K$-based CTOD correlation remains valid because the stress intensity factor is path-independent and uniquely characterizes crack tip fields even with extensive plasticity; hence CTOD is always proportional to $K^{2}/E'$ regardless of plastic zone size, where $E' = E/(1-\\nu^2)$.\n\nC. When the crack tip plastic zone occupies a non-negligible fraction of both thickness and ligament, and especially after stable crack advance begins, a cohesive zone model (CZM) with a traction–separation law calibrated from the measured $J$–$R$ or CTOD–$R$ curve provides a more fundamental description of opening and separation and can supplant a $K$-based CTOD correlation.\n\nD.

Under monotonic proportional loading, the J-integral remains path-independent even for large-scale plasticity in a power-law hardening material, and the HRR field links CTOD to $J$ through a material- and hardening-dependent factor with the correct dimensional scaling, so a $J$-based CTOD is appropriate here.\n\nChoose all that apply.", "solution": "The problem requires an analysis of the appropriate fracture mechanics framework for a ductile steel specimen under conditions that suggest significant plastic deformation.

A classical estimate for the plastic zone radius, $r_p$, under plane strain and small-scale yielding (SSY) conditions is given by the Irwin model:\n$$r_p \\approx \\frac{1}{3\\pi} \\left(\\frac{K_I}{\\sigma_y}\\right)^2$$\nSubstituting the provided values:\n$$r_p \\approx \\frac{1}{3\\pi} \\left(\\frac{180\\,\\mathrm{MPa}\\sqrt{\\mathrm{m}}}{600\\,\\mathrm{MPa}}\\right)^2 = \\frac{1}{3\\pi} (0.3\\,\\sqrt{\\mathrm{m}})^2 = \\frac{0.09}{3\\pi}\\,\\mathrm{m} \\approx 0.00955\\,\\mathrm{m} = 9.55\\,\\mathrm{mm}$$\nThe LEFM framework, and thus a $K_I$-based characterization, is considered valid only if the plastic zone is small compared to the relevant geometric lengths, such as the crack length $a$ and the ligament $b$.

This constitutes a clear violation of the small-scale yielding assumption. The ASTM E399 standard for $K_{Ic}$ testing codifies this requirement by stating that specimen dimensions $a$, $B$, and $b$ must all be greater than $2.5(K_Q/\\sigma_y)^2$. For the given values:\n$$2.5 \\left(\\frac{K_I}{\\sigma_y}\\right)^2 = 2.5(0.3)^2\\,\\mathrm{m} = 0.225\\,\\mathrm{m} = 225\\,\\mathrm{mm}$$\nThe specimen dimensions ($a=b=B=25\\,\\mathrm{mm}$) are all significantly smaller than this requirement.\nThe conclusion is inescapable: the problem describes a state of large-scale yielding (LSY), where LEFM is invalid. The provided $K_I$ value is merely a notional quantity calculated from a linear-elastic formula and does not represent the true crack tip field amplitude. The problem statement itself alludes to this by mentioning observations of large strains and crack tip blunting. The problem is therefore scientifically sound and well-posed, as it sets up a scenario to correctly test the limits of LEFM and the transition to elastic-plastic fracture mechanics (EPFM).\n\n**Derivation and Option Analysis**\n\nWith LEFM being invalid, a different framework must be used. For a power-law hardening material under monotonic, proportional loading, deformation theory of plasticity applies. In this context, the J-integral introduced by J.R. Rice is a path-independent parameter that characterizes the crack tip stress and strain fields, even under LSY. The J-integral generalizes the energy release rate concept to non-linear materials.\nThe crack tip fields are described by the Hutchinson–Rice–Rosengren (HRR) singular solution, for which $J$ is the amplitude. A key consequence of the HRR theory is the relationship between $J$ and the crack tip opening displacement (CTOD), denoted $\\delta_t$:\n$$J = m \\sigma_y \\delta_t$$\nwhere $m$ is a dimensionless parameter that depends on the material's hardening behavior and the level of stress triaxiality (constraint) at the crack tip. This relationship provides the necessary link to characterize CTOD in the EPFM regime. Experimentally, $J$ can be determined from the area under the specimen's load versus load-point displacement curve.\n\nNow, I will evaluate each statement.\n\n**A. Based on the plastic zone size under plane strain relative to the ligament, the small-scale yielding assumption is violated; therefore the proportionality of CTOD to a function of $K$ from linear elasticity is not geometry- or constraint-independent. One should transition to a J-integral (J)-based characterization, computing $J$ from the area under the load–displacement curve with an appropriate specimen-dependent factor, and then relate CTOD to $J$ using the Hutchinson–Rice–Rosengren (HRR) near-tip asymptotic field for a power-law hardening solid. If high fidelity is required, include a constraint correction (e.g., via a $Q$-parameter or $T$-stress).**\n\nThis statement is entirely correct. It begins with the correct diagnosis: the SSY assumption is violated due to the large plastic zone. It correctly identifies the consequence: the $K$-based CTOD correlation loses its uniqueness and becomes geometry-dependent. It then proposes the correct solution: transition to a J-integral based framework. It correctly describes both the experimental procedure for measuring $J$ and the theoretical HRR foundation for relating $J$ to CTOD. Finally, it correctly mentions the modern approach to account for higher-order constraint effects using a second parameter like the $Q$-stress, which is necessary for high-fidelity predictions in LSY. Every part of this statement is scientifically sound and appropriate for the problem.\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\n**B. The $K$-based CTOD correlation remains valid because the stress intensity factor is path-independent and uniquely characterizes crack tip fields even with extensive plasticity; hence CTOD is always proportional to $K^{2}/E'$ regardless of plastic zone size, where $E' = E/(1-\\nu^2)$.**\n\nThis statement is fundamentally incorrect. The stress intensity factor $K$ does not uniquely characterize crack tip fields under extensive plasticity; that is the role of the J-integral. The validity of $K$ is strictly limited to the SSY regime. The assertion that CTOD is *always* proportional to $K^2/E'$ is a gross misrepresentation of fracture mechanics principles. The statement confuses the properties of $K$ and $J$.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**C. When the crack tip plastic zone occupies a non-negligible fraction of both thickness and ligament, and especially after stable crack advance begins, a cohesive zone model (CZM) with a traction–separation law calibrated from the measured $J$–$R$ or CTOD–$R$ curve provides a more fundamental description of opening and separation and can supplant a $K$-based CTOD correlation.**\n\nThis statement accurately describes a valid and powerful numerical/analytical technique for modeling fracture. The conditions described (large plastic zone) are precisely where a $K$-based approach fails and more sophisticated models are needed. A CZM, which describes the material separation process through a traction-separation law, is such a model. It is particularly well-suited for modeling ductile tearing (stable crack advance), which is the physical process that follows the state described in the problem. Calibrating the cohesive law against experimental resistance curves (like a $J-R$ curve) is a standard and accepted methodology. A CZM is indeed a valid framework to transition to, supplanting the invalid $K$-based correlation.\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\n**D. Because $\\nu = 0.30$ and $a/W = 0.50$ nominally promote high constraint, the $K$-based CTOD correlation is conservative and should be preferred over a J-integral based approach for any level of plasticity; the J-integral is unnecessary unless unloading occurs.**\n\nThis statement is flawed in its reasoning. While a deeply cracked bend specimen ($a/W = 0.5$) is a high-constraint geometry, this fact does not rescue the validity of the $K$-field in the presence of LSY. High constraint helps to preserve the HRR field (and thus $J$-dominance) to higher load levels, but it does not preserve the LEFM field. Furthermore, claiming the $K$-based correlation is \"conservative\" and \"should be preferred\" is incorrect; using an invalid theoretical framework is not a conservative practice, it is simply wrong. The assertion that the J-integral is unnecessary unless unloading occurs is also false. The primary purpose of the J-integral is to handle non-linear material behavior under monotonic loading. Its path-dependence upon unloading is a limitation, not its sole reason for existence.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**E. Under monotonic proportional loading, the J-integral remains path-independent even for large-scale plasticity in a power-law hardening material, and the HRR field links CTOD to $J$ through a material- and hardening-dependent factor with the correct dimensional scaling, so a $J$-based CTOD is appropriate here.**\n\nThis statement concisely presents the core theoretical justification for using the J-integral in this problem. It correctly states the conditions for the path-independence of $J$ (monotonic loading, deformation plasticity, which includes power-law hardening materials). It correctly identifies the role of the HRR field in linking $J$ and CTOD. It also correctly notes the dependence of the proportionality factor on material properties and confirms the dimensional consistency. The conclusion that a $J$-based CTOD characterization is appropriate is therefore fully justified by these foundational principles of EPFM.\nVerdict: **Correct**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{ACE}$$", "id": "2627058"}]}
