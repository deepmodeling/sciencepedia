The derivation begins with the specified kinematic assumptions, proceeds through the constitutive law and equilibrium equations, and culminates in a specific formula for the given rectangular ring cross-section.\n\nFirst, we establish the circumferential strain distribution, $\\epsilon_\\phi(r)$, as a function of the radial coordinate $r$, measured from the center of curvature. The kinematic hypothesis states that cross-sections, which are initially plane and radial, remain plane and radial after bending. Consider two adjacent cross-sections initially separated by a small angle $d\\phi$. The initial length of a circumferential fiber at radius $r$ is $ds = r \\, d\\phi$. Upon application of a bending moment, the two cross-sections rotate relative to each other by a small angle $d\\psi$ about the neutral axis, which is located at an unknown radius $r_n$. The change in length of the fiber at radius $r$ is the relative displacement due to this rotation, which is approximately $\\delta(ds) = (r - r_n) \\, d\\psi$. The circumferential strain $\\epsilon_\\phi$ is the change in length divided by the original length:\n$$\n\\epsilon_\\phi(r) = \\frac{\\delta(ds)}{ds} = \\frac{(r - r_n) \\, d\\psi}{r \\, d\\phi}\n$$\nFor pure bending of a uniform beam, the relative rotation per unit initial angle, $\\omega = \\frac{d\\psi}{d\\phi}$, is a constant that depends on the applied moment and beam properties. Thus, the strain distribution takes the form:\n$$\n\\epsilon_\\phi(r) = \\omega \\left(\\frac{r - r_n}{r}\\right) = \\omega \\left(1 - \\frac{r_n}{r}\\right)\n$$\nThis equation shows that the strain is zero at $r = r_n$ and varies hyperbolically across the cross-section, a key distinction from the linear strain distribution in straight beams.\n\nSecond, we apply the constitutive law for a linear elastic material, which is Hooke's Law. The problem states that radial stress is negligible ($\\sigma_r \\approx 0$), allowing us to consider a uniaxial stress state in the circumferential direction. The circumferential stress $\\sigma_\\phi$ is related to the strain $\\epsilon_\\phi$ by the elastic modulus $E$:\n$$\n\\sigma_\\phi(r) = E \\, \\epsilon_\\phi(r) = E \\, \\omega \\left(1 - \\frac{r_n}{r}\\right)\n$$\n\nThird, we enforce the equilibrium condition for pure bending. Pure bending is defined by the presence of a net bending moment with no net axial force acting on the cross-section. The condition of zero resultant circumferential force $F_\\phi$ is expressed as an integral of the stress over the cross-sectional area $A$:\n$$\nF_\\phi = \\int_A \\sigma_\\phi(r) \\, dA = 0\n$$\nSubstituting the derived expression for $\\sigma_\\phi(r)$:\n$$\n\\int_A E \\, \\omega \\left(1 - \\frac{r_n}{r}\\right) \\, dA = 0\n$$\nThe elastic modulus $E$ is non-zero, and the kinematic factor $\\omega$ is non-zero for any non-trivial bending deformation. Therefore, the integral itself must be zero:\n$$\n\\int_A \\left(1 - \\frac{r_n}{r}\\right) \\, dA = 0\n$$\nWe can separate this into two integrals:\n$$\n\\int_A dA - \\int_A \\frac{r_n}{r} \\, dA = 0\n$$\nThe radius of the neutral axis, $r_n$, is a constant for a given cross-section and can be factored out of the second integral. The first integral, $\\int_A dA$, is by definition the total area $A$ of the cross-section.\n$$\nA - r_n \\int_A \\frac{1}{r} \\, dA = 0\n$$\nSolving for $r_n$, we obtain the general integral identity for the neutral axis radius in a curved beam:\n$$\nr_n = \\frac{A}{\\int_A \\frac{1}{r} \\, dA}\n$$\nThis expression defines $r_n$ for a curved beam with an arbitrary cross-section under pure bending.\n\nFourth, we specialize this result to the given rectangular ring cross-section. The cross-section has a constant width $b$, an inner radius $r_i$, and an outer radius $r_o$. The area element $dA$ can be written as $dA = b \\, dr$.\nThe total area $A$ is calculated by integrating $dA$ from $r_i$ to $r_o$:\n$$\nA = \\int_{r_i}^{r_o} b \\, dr = b [r]_{r_i}^{r_o} = b(r_o - r_i)\n$$\nThe integral in the denominator is evaluated similarly:\n$$\n\\int_A \\frac{1}{r} \\, dA = \\int_{r_i}^{r_o} \\frac{1}{r} (b \\, dr) = b \\int_{r_i}^{r_o} \\frac{1}{r} \\, dr\n$$\nEvaluating this integral yields:\n$$\nb \\left[\\ln(r)\\right]_{r_i}^{r_o} = b (\\ln(r_o) - \\ln(r_i)) = b \\ln\\left(\\frac{r_o}{r_i}\\right)\n$$\nHere, we use the natural logarithm $\\ln$, and because the problem defines $r_o > r_i$, which are radii and thus positive, the argument of the logarithm is greater than $1$.\n\nFinally, we substitute the expressions for $A$ and $\\int_A (1/r) \\, dA$ back into the general formula for $r_n$:\n$$\nr_n = \\frac{b(r_o - r_i)}{b \\ln\\left(\\frac{r_o}{r_i}\\right)}\n$$\nThe constant width $b$ cancels from the numerator and denominator, as does the elastic modulus $E$ earlier in the derivation.
