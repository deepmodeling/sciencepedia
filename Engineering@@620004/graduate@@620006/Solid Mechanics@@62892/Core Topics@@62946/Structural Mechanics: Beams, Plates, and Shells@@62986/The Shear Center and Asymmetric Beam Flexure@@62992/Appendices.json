The beam axis is along $x$, and the cross-section lies in the $y$–$z$ plane. The web midline coincides with $z=0$ and extends from $y=-h/2$ to $y=+h/2$. The flanges lie at $y=\\pm h/2$ and extend from $z=0$ (at the web) to $z=b$ (free tips). The section is symmetric about the horizontal axis $y=0$.\n\nA vertical shear force $V$ acts in the $+y$ direction.

The geometry, loading conditions, and objectives are clearly defined and scientifically sound. All provided information is consistent and sufficient for deriving a unique solution from first principles. Therefore, the problem is deemed valid and a full reasoned solution is presented below.\n\nThe objective is to find the horizontal offset, $e$, of the shear center from the centroid for the given thin-walled channel section. The cross-section is symmetric about the horizontal axis $y=0$, which is therefore the horizontal centroidal axis. The applied vertical shear force $V$ is in the $+y$ direction, so bending occurs about the horizontal centroidal axis (the neutral axis).\n\nFirst, we calculate the second moment of area, $I$, about the horizontal centroidal axis ($y=0$). The cross-section consists of a vertical web and two horizontal flanges. Using the thin-walled approximation ($t \\ll h, t \\ll b$), we neglect the flanges' second moment of area about their own axes and terms of order $\\mathcal{O}(t^2)$ and higher.\nThe second moment of area of the web is:\n$$I_{\\text{web}} = \\int_{-h/2}^{h/2} y^2 (t \\, dy) = t \\left[\\frac{y^3}{3}\\right]_{-h/2}^{h/2} = \\frac{t h^3}{12}$$\nThe second moment of area of the two flanges is calculated using the parallel axis theorem, where the area of each flange is $A_f = b t$ and their distance from the $y=0$ axis is $h/2$:\n$$I_{\\text{flanges}} = 2 \\times (A_f) \\times \\left(\\frac{h}{2}\\right)^2 = 2 (b t) \\left(\\frac{h^2}{4}\\right) = \\frac{b t h^2}{2}$$\nThe total second moment of area is the sum:\n$$I = I_{\\text{web}} + I_{\\text{flanges}} = \\frac{t h^3}{12} + \\frac{b t h^2}{2} = \\frac{t h^2}{12}(h + 6b)$$\n\nNext, we determine the shear flow distribution, $q(s)$, using the formula $q = VQ/I$. Let's analyze the top flange. We define a coordinate $s$ starting from the free tip ($z=b$) and increasing towards the web ($z=0$). For a point at a distance $s$ from the tip, the first moment of area, $Q$, of the section beyond this point is:\n$$Q_{\\text{flange}}(s) = (\\text{Area}) \\times (\\text{y-distance to neutral axis}) = (s t) \\times \\left(\\frac{h}{2}\\right) = \\frac{s t h}{2}$$\nThe shear flow in the top flange is:\n$$q_{\\text{flange}}(s) = \\frac{V Q_{\\text{flange}}(s)}{I} = \\frac{V}{I} \\left(\\frac{s t h}{2}\\right) = \\frac{V t h s}{2I}$$\nThis shear flow is directed from the free tip towards the web, i.e., in the $-z$ direction. The total horizontal force, $F_f$, in the top flange is the integral of the shear flow along its width:\n$$F_f = \\int_0^b q_{\\text{flange}}(s) \\, ds = \\int_0^b \\frac{V t h s}{2I} \\, ds = \\frac{V t h}{2I} \\left[\\frac{s^2}{2}\\right]_0^b = \\frac{V t h b^2}{4I}$$\nBy symmetry, the shear flow in the bottom flange has the same magnitude distribution as the top flange, also directed from the free tip towards the web. This results in a horizontal force $F_f$ in each flange. The total internal twisting moment, $M_{\\text{int}}$, produced by the shear flows in the flanges is the sum of the moments of these flows about the web's centerline. This evaluates to:\n$$M_{\\text{int}} = \\frac{V t h^2 b^2}{4I}$$\nThe direction of this internal moment is clockwise when viewed from the positive $x$-axis.\n\nThe shear center is the point $(y_{SC}, z_{SC})$ through which the external shear force $V$ must pass to produce bending with no twisting. By symmetry, the shear center must lie on the $y=0$ axis, so $y_{SC}=0$. The moment produced by the external force $V$ applied at the shear center must balance the internal twisting moment $M_{\\text{int}}$. Let's take moments about the centerline of the web ($z=0$). The shear flow in the web acts along this line and thus produces no moment about it. The moment from the flange forces is $M_{\\text{int}}$. The external force $V$ acting at $z=z_{SC}$ produces a moment $M_{\\text{ext}} = V \\times (-z_{SC})$ about $z=0$. The term $-z_{SC}$ is the moment arm, and it must be positive as $z_{SC}$ will be negative to produce a counter-clockwise moment to balance the clockwise $M_{int}$.\nEquating the moments:\n$$V(-z_{SC}) = M_{\\text{int}} = \\frac{V t h^2 b^2}{4I}$$\nSolving for $z_{SC}$, the horizontal coordinate of the shear center:\n$$z_{SC} = -\\frac{t h^2 b^2}{4I}$$\nSubstituting the expression for $I$:\n$$z_{SC} = -\\frac{t h^2 b^2}{4 \\left(\\frac{t h^2}{12}(h + 6b)\\right)} = -\\frac{b^2}{\\frac{1}{3}(h + 6b)} = -\\frac{3b^2}{h+6b}$$\n\nThe problem requires the offset, $e$, from the centroid to the shear center. We must first find the centroid's horizontal coordinate, $z_C$. The total area of the section is $A = A_{\\text{web}} + A_{\\text{flanges}} = ht + 2bt = t(h+2b)$. The first moment of area of the section about the $y$-axis ($z=0$) is:\n$$S_y = \\int z \\, dA = \\int_{\\text{web}} z \\, dA + \\int_{\\text{flanges}} z \\, dA$$\nThe web is at $z=0$, so its contribution is zero. For the two flanges:\n$$S_y = 2 \\times \\int_0^b z (t \\, dz) = 2t \\left[\\frac{z^2}{2}\\right]_0^b = t b^2$$\nThe centroid coordinate $z_C$ is:\n$$z_C = \\frac{S_y}{A} = \\frac{t b^2}{t(h+2b)} = \\frac{b^2}{h+2b}$$\n\nFinally, the offset $e$ is defined as the signed horizontal offset from the centroid to the shear center, positive towards negative $z$. This corresponds to $e = z_C - z_{SC}$.\n$$e = z_C - z_{SC} = \\frac{b^2}{h+2b} - \\left(-\\frac{3b^2}{h+6b}\\right) = \\frac{b^2}{h+2b} + \\frac{3b^2}{h+6b}$$\nTo combine these terms, we find a common denominator:\n$$e = b^2 \\left( \\frac{(h+6b) + 3(h+2b)}{(h+2b)(h+6b)} \\right)$$\n$$e = b^2 \\left( \\frac{h+6b+3h+6b}{(h+2b)(h+6b)} \\right) = b^2 \\left( \\frac{4h+12b}{(h+2b)(h+6b)} \\right)$$\nFactoring out a $4$ from the numerator gives the final expression for $e$:\n$$e = \\frac{4b^2(h+3b)}{(h+2b)(h+6b)}$$\nThis is the required closed-form expression for the offset of the shear center from the centroid, in terms of $b$ and $h$ only.

We first calculate the twisting moment $T_x$ about the centroid $(0,0)$ generated by the shear stress distribution when the force $V_y$ is applied through the centroid.\n$$ T_{x} = \\iint_{A} \\left( y\\tau_{xz} - z\\tau_{xy} \\right) dA $$\nwhere $A$ is the area of the elliptical cross-section.

The integrand is an odd function with respect to the variable $z$. For any function $f(y,z)$ that is odd in $z$, i.e., $f(y,-z) = -f(y,z)$, its integral over an area symmetric about the $y$-axis is zero.\n$$ \\iint_A f(y,z) dA = \\int_{-a}^{a} \\left[ \\int_{-b\\sqrt{1-y^2/a^2}}^{b\\sqrt{1-y^2/a^2}} f(y,z) dz \\right] dy = \\int_{-a}^{a} 0 \\, dy = 0 $$\nTherefore, the twisting moment about the centroid is $T_{x}=0$.\n\nThe location of the shear center $(y_s, z_s)$ is related to the twisting moment about the centroid $T_x$ by the formula $T_x = V_y z_s - V_z y_s$, where $(V_y, V_z)$ is the applied shear force. In our case, $V_z=0$ and $V_y$ is the applied force. We found $T_x=0$. So,\n$$ 0 = V_y z_s - 0 \\cdot y_s \\implies V_y z_s = 0 $$\nSince $V_y$ is a non-zero applied force, we must have $z_s=0$.\nTo find $y_s$, we would consider a transverse force $V_z$ applied through the centroid and calculate the resulting moment $T'_x$. By symmetry, swapping the roles of $(y,a)$ and $(z,b)$ and applying a load $V_z$, the governing equation would be $\\nabla^2\\Psi = -(V_z/I_y)z$. The solution $\\Psi$ would be an odd function of $z$. The resulting integrand for $T'_x$ would be an odd function of $y$, leading to $T'_x=0$. The shear center equation would be $0 = 0 \\cdot z_s - V_z y_s$, which implies $y_s=0$.\n\nTherefore, the shear center lies at the centroid, $(y_s, z_s) = (0,0)$.

All angles are in radians.", "solution": "We begin from fundamentals of prismatic beam torsion and asymmetric flexure for thin-walled open sections. Let the beam axis be the $x$-axis, the vertical load be $P$ (producing a shear resultant $V = P$ at the free end), and the lateral coordinate measured from the web midline be $e$. For a thin-walled open section, the Saint-Venant torsional response and the restrained warping response (Vlasov theory) superpose linearly. The essential ingredients are:\n\n1) The external torque about the beam axis induced by a vertical shear resultant $V$ applied at lateral offset $e$ is\n$$\nM_{t}(x) = V \\, \\big(e - e_{\\text{SV}}\\big),\n$$\nwhen measured relative to the Saint-Venant shear center offset $e_{\\text{SV}}$. This follows from the definition of the shear center as the point of action of the transverse load producing no net torsional moment in Saint-Venant torsion.\n\n2) In Saint-Venant torsion, away from end constraints, the twist rate is related to torque as\n$$\n\\theta'_{\\text{SV}}(x) = \\frac{M_{t}(x)}{G J},\n$$\nwhere $J$ is the Saint-Venant torsion constant of the cross-section. For a constant $M_{t}$ along the span (as in this cantilever under a tip force with fixed offset), the Saint-Venant twist rate is approximately constant in the interior.\n\n3) In a short cantilever, warping restraint at the clamp and free-end boundary conditions give rise to a nonuniform torsion field governed by Vlasov’s one-dimensional theory. The governing relation connecting the Saint-Venant and warping contributions can be written in terms of the bimoment $B$ as\n$$\nM_{t}(x) = G J \\, \\theta'(x) - \\frac{\\mathrm{d} B}{\\mathrm{d}x}, \\quad B(x) = E I_{w} \\, \\theta''(x),\n$$\nwhere $I_{w}$ is the warping constant. Eliminating $B$ yields the linear ordinary differential equation\n$$\nE I_{w} \\, \\theta'''(x) - G J \\, \\theta'(x) + M_{t}(x) = 0,\n$$\nwhose homogeneous solution decays or grows with the characteristic warping length\n$$\n\\lambda = \\sqrt{\\frac{E I_{w}}{G J}}.\n$$\nBecause $M_{t}(x)$ is constant along the span here, a particular solution is the Saint-Venant solution with constant $\\theta'_{\\text{SV}} = M_{t}/(GJ)$, while the homogeneous solution consists of exponentials $\\propto \\exp(\\pm x/\\lambda)$, which form boundary layers near the ends. Therefore, in the central region $x \\in [0.3 L, 0.7 L]$, the twist angle can be decomposed as a sum of an “interior” part proportional to $M_{t}$ and an “end-effect” part independent of $M_{t}$:\n$$\n\\theta(x; e) = \\theta_{\\text{SV}}(x; e) + \\theta_{\\text{end}}(x),\n$$\nwith\n$$\n\\theta_{\\text{SV}}(x; e) \\propto M_{t} = V \\, (e - e_{\\text{SV}}), \\quad \\theta_{\\text{end}}(x) \\text{ independent of } e.\n$$\n\n4) Averaging $\\theta(x; e)$ over a fixed central window $x \\in [0.3 L, 0.7 L]$ preserves linearity in $M_{t}$ and thus in $e$:\n$$\n\\langle \\theta \\rangle_{c}(e) \\equiv \\frac{1}{0.4 L} \\int_{0.3 L}^{0.7 L} \\theta(x; e) \\, \\mathrm{d}x = a \\, (e - e_{\\text{SV}}) + b,\n$$\nfor some constants $a$ and $b$ that depend on $P$, $G$, $J$, $E$, $I_{w}$, and $L$, but not on $e$.\n\nDefinition of apparent shear center.
