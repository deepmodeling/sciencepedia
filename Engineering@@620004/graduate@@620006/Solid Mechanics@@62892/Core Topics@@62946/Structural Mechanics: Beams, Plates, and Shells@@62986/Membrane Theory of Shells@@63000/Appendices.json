This is a standard topic in solid mechanics.\n- **Well-Posedness**: The problem is well-posed. The geometry and loading possess spherical symmetry, which suggests a unique and stable solution for the stress state. The question regarding displacement is also well-posed, requiring a justification based on the structure of the governing equations.\n- **Objectivity and Completeness**: The problem is stated in precise, objective language. For a complete, boundaryless sphere under uniform loading, no boundary conditions are required, thus the problem is self-contained.\n\nThe verdict is that the problem is **valid**. It is a standard, solvable problem in mechanics. We shall proceed with the solution.\n\nThe analysis begins by exploiting the spherical symmetry of both the shell geometry and the applied load. Due to this symmetry, the state of stress and deformation must be identical at every point on the shell's middle surface. Consequently, the membrane stress resultants, $N_{\\theta}$ and $N_{\\phi}$, cannot be functions of the angular coordinates $\\theta$ and $\\phi$. They must be constants over the entire surface. We will now formally demonstrate this by applying the principle of static equilibrium.\n\nLet us consider a free body diagram consisting of a spherical cap cut from the main shell by a plane defined by a constant co-latitude angle $\\theta$. We will enforce equilibrium of forces on this cap in the direction of the axis of symmetry (the z-axis).\n\nTwo sets of forces act on the cap:\n1.  The force resulting from the internal pressure $p$ acting on the curved surface of the cap.\n2.  The force resulting from the meridional membrane stress resultant $N_{\\theta}$ acting along the cut circular edge.\n\nThe total upward force, $F_p$, exerted by the uniform internal pressure $p$ on the cap, when projected onto the z-axis, is equal to the pressure multiplied by the projected area of the cap onto a plane perpendicular to this axis. The projected area is a circle of radius $r = R\\sin\\theta$.\nThe area of this projected circle is $A_{proj} = \\pi r^2 = \\pi (R\\sin\\theta)^2$.\nThus, the force from the pressure in the z-direction is:\n$$F_p = p A_{proj} = p \\pi R^2 \\sin^2\\theta$$\n\nThe meridional stress resultant $N_{\\theta}$ is a force per unit length acting tangentially to the meridian along the cut edge. The total length of the cut edge is its circumference, $L = 2\\pi r = 2\\pi R\\sin\\theta$. The force $N_{\\theta}$ acts at an angle $\\theta$ with respect to the plane of the cut (the xy-plane). The component of this force parallel to the z-axis is $N_{\\theta} \\sin\\theta$. Since $N_{\\theta}$ is tensile (positive), this force acts downward on the cap, balancing the pressure. The total force from the membrane stress resultant in the z-direction, $F_N$, is:\n$$F_N = (N_{\\theta} \\sin\\theta) \\times L = (N_{\\theta} \\sin\\theta)(2\\pi R\\sin\\theta) = 2\\pi R N_{\\theta} \\sin^2\\theta$$\n\nFor static equilibrium in the z-direction, the sum of forces must be zero: $\\sum F_z = 0$.\n$$F_p - F_N = 0$$\n$$p \\pi R^2 \\sin^2\\theta - 2\\pi R N_{\\theta} \\sin^2\\theta = 0$$\nFor any cap where $\\theta \\ne 0$ and $\\theta \\ne \\pi$, we can divide by the common factor $2\\pi R \\sin^2\\theta$:\n$$\\frac{1}{2} p R - N_{\\theta} = 0$$\n$$N_{\\theta} = \\frac{pR}{2}$$\nThis result is independent of the angle $\\theta$ at which the cut was made. This explicitly proves that the meridional stress resultant $N_{\\theta}$ is constant over the entire sphere.\n\nTo find the circumferential stress resultant $N_{\\phi}$, we use the local equilibrium equation in the direction normal to the shell surface. This equation, known as the Laplace-Young equation for membranes, relates the stress resultants to the normal pressure and the principal radii of curvature. For a sphere, both principal radii of curvature are equal to the sphere's radius, $R_1 = R_2 = R$. The equation is:\n$$\\frac{N_{\\theta}}{R_1} + \\frac{N_{\\phi}}{R_2} = p$$\n$$\\frac{N_{\\theta}}{R} + \\frac{N_{\\phi}}{R} = p$$\nSubstituting the derived value for $N_{\\theta}$:\n$$\\frac{1}{R} \\left( \\frac{pR}{2} \\right) + \\frac{N_{\\phi}}{R} = p$$\n$$\\frac{p}{2} + \\frac{N_{\\phi}}{R} = p$$\n$$\\frac{N_{\\phi}}{R} = p - \\frac{p}{2} = \\frac{p}{2}$$\n$$N_{\\phi} = \\frac{pR}{2}$$\nThus, we find that $N_{\\theta} = N_{\\phi}$. This confirms that the membrane field is one of uniform, equi-biaxial tension. The shared value is $N = N_{\\theta} = N_{\\phi} = \\frac{pR}{2}$. This completes the determination of the membrane stress field.\n\nRegarding the second part of the question: the normal displacement $w$ is **not** determined by membrane equilibrium alone.\n\nThe justification is as follows: The equations of static equilibrium, which we have used, relate the externally applied loads ($p$) to the internal stress resultants ($N_{\\theta}$, $N_{\\phi}$). In this case, the system is statically determinate, meaning the stress resultants can be found solely from equilibrium considerations without any reference to material properties or deformation. The displacement variable $w$ does not appear in any of the equilibrium equations.\n\nTo determine the displacement $w$, one must introduce two additional sets of equations:\n1.  **Kinematic Equations (Strain-Displacement Relations)**: These relate the components of membrane strain ($\\epsilon_{\\theta}$, $\\epsilon_{\\phi}$) to the displacement field. For the symmetric expansion of a sphere, the hoop strain is directly related to the radial displacement by $\\epsilon_{\\phi} = \\frac{w}{R}$.\n2.  **Constitutive Equations (Stress-Strain Relations)**: These describe the material behavior, linking the stress resultants to the strains. For a linear elastic, isotropic material, this is Hooke's Law for plane stress, expressed as:\n    $$\\epsilon_{\\theta} = \\frac{1}{Et}(N_{\\theta} - \\nu N_{\\phi})$$\n    $$\\epsilon_{\\phi} = \\frac{1}{Et}(N_{\\phi} - \\nu N_{\\theta})$$\n    where $E$ is the Young's modulus and $\\nu$ is the Poisson's ratio of the material.\n\nOnly by solving the full system of equilibrium, kinematic, and constitutive equations can the displacement $w$ be determined. Its calculation, $w = \\frac{pR^2}{2Et}(1-\\nu)$, clearly depends on material properties ($E, \\nu$) and thickness $t$, which are not part of the equilibrium analysis.

First, we derive the boundary conditions at the edge of the circular opening. Second, we compute the stress concentration factor by reducing the problem to that of a flat plate with a hole.\n\nPart 1: Derivation of the Traction-Free Boundary Condition\n\nIn membrane theory, the state of stress at any point in the shell's middle surface is described by the symmetric membrane stress resultant tensor, $\\mathbf{N}$. The traction vector, $\\mathbf{t}$, which represents the force per unit length acting on a curve within the surface, is given by the Cauchy formula for membranes:\n$$\n\\mathbf{t} = \\mathbf{N} \\cdot \\mathbf{n}\n$$\nwhere $\\mathbf{n}$ is the unit normal vector to the curve, lying in the tangent plane of the shell. A traction-free boundary is one where no external forces are applied. Therefore, the traction vector must be identically zero along this boundary:\n$$\n\\mathbf{t} = \\mathbf{N} \\cdot \\mathbf{n} = \\mathbf{0}\n$$\nThis is the general tensorial form of the traction-free boundary condition.\n\nNow, we specialize this condition to the specific problem. We use a local polar coordinate system $\\{r, \\theta\\}$ centered at the opening, which lies in the tangent plane to the shell at the center of the opening. The boundary of the opening is a circle defined by $r=a$. The outward unit normal vector to this circular boundary, within the tangent plane, is $\\mathbf{n} = \\mathbf{e}_r$, where $\\mathbf{e}_r$ is the radial basis vector.\n\nIn this polar coordinate system, the membrane stress resultant tensor $\\mathbf{N}$ has components $N_{rr}$, $N_{\\theta\\theta}$, and $N_{r\\theta} = N_{\\theta r}$. The tensor can be written in terms of the basis vectors $\\{\\mathbf{e}_r, \\mathbf{e}_\\theta\\}$ as:\n$$\n\\mathbf{N} = N_{rr} (\\mathbf{e}_r \\otimes \\mathbf{e}_r) + N_{r\\theta} (\\mathbf{e}_r \\otimes \\mathbf{e}_\\theta + \\mathbf{e}_\\theta \\otimes \\mathbf{e}_r) + N_{\\theta\\theta} (\\mathbf{e}_\\theta \\otimes \\mathbf{e}_\\theta)\n$$\nWe apply the traction-free condition at the boundary $r=a$ by computing the dot product $\\mathbf{N} \\cdot \\mathbf{n}$:\n$$\n\\mathbf{t} = \\mathbf{N} \\cdot \\mathbf{e}_r = \\left[ N_{rr} (\\mathbf{e}_r \\otimes \\mathbf{e}_r) + N_{r\\theta} (\\mathbf{e}_r \\otimes \\mathbf{e}_\\theta + \\mathbf{e}_\\theta \\otimes \\mathbf{e}_r) + N_{\\theta\\theta} (\\mathbf{e}_\\theta \\otimes \\mathbf{e}_\\theta) \\right] \\cdot \\mathbf{e}_r\n$$\nUsing the orthogonality of the basis vectors, i.e., $\\mathbf{e}_r \\cdot \\mathbf{e}_r = 1$, $\\mathbf{e}_\\theta \\cdot \\mathbf{e}_r = 0$, we find:\n$$\n\\mathbf{t} = N_{rr} (\\mathbf{e}_r) + N_{r\\theta} (\\mathbf{e}_\\theta)\n$$\nThe condition $\\mathbf{t} = \\mathbf{0}$ means $N_{rr} \\mathbf{e}_r + N_{r\\theta} \\mathbf{e}_\\theta = 0 \\mathbf{e}_r + 0 \\mathbf{e}_\\theta$. Since $\\mathbf{e}_r$ and $\\mathbf{e}_\\theta$ form an orthogonal basis, their respective coefficients must be zero. This provides the boundary conditions on the stress resultants at the edge of the opening $r=a$:\n$$\nN_{rr}(r=a, \\theta) = 0\n$$\n$$\nN_{r\\theta}(r=a, \\theta) = 0\n$$\nfor all values of $\\theta$.\n\nPart 2: Calculation of the Stress Concentration Factor\n\nThe problem states that the radius of the opening is much smaller than the radius of the shell, $a \\ll R$. This condition allows us to approximate the curved shell surface in the immediate vicinity of the opening as a flat plane. The geometry of a small spherical cap of radius $a$ is nearly flat, and the governing equations of equilibrium for the membrane, which contain curvature terms like $1/R$, can be simplified by neglecting these terms. The problem thus reduces to that of an infinite flat membrane (a plate) with a central circular hole of radius $a$.\n\nThe far-field stress state in the spherical shell is given as equibiaxial, $N_{\\theta\\theta} = N_{\\phi\\phi} = N_0 = pR/2$. In the context of the local flat plate approximation, this corresponds to a remote biaxial tension where the stress resultants at infinity are $N_{xx} = N_0$ and $N_{yy} = N_0$ in a Cartesian system, or, in polar coordinates, as $r \\to \\infty$:\n$$\nN_{rr} \\to N_0, \\quad N_{\\theta\\theta} \\to N_0, \\quad N_{r\\theta} \\to 0\n$$\nWe must now solve this two-dimensional elasticity problem: an infinite plate with a circular hole of radius $a$, subject to the boundary conditions $N_{rr}(a,\\theta) = 0$, $N_{r\\theta}(a,\\theta) = 0$, and the specified far-field conditions.\n\nThe solution for the stress components around a hole in an infinite plate under general remote biaxial loading ($N_x$, $N_y$) is a classic result from elasticity theory (Kirsch problem). The stress resultants in polar coordinates $\\{r, \\theta\\}$ are:\n$$\nN_{rr}(r,\\theta) = \\frac{N_x+N_y}{2}\\left(1-\\frac{a^2}{r^2}\\right) + \\frac{N_x-N_y}{2}\\left(1-4\\frac{a^2}{r^2}+3\\frac{a^4}{r^4}\\right)\\cos(2\\theta)\n$$\n$$\nN_{\\theta\\theta}(r,\\theta) = \\frac{N_x+N_y}{2}\\left(1+\\frac{a^2}{r^2}\\right) - \\frac{N_x-N_y}{2}\\left(1+3\\frac{a^4}{r^4}\\right)\\cos(2\\theta)\n$$\n$$\nN_{r\\theta}(r,\\theta) = -\\frac{N_x-N_y}{2}\\left(1+2\\frac{a^2}{r^2}-3\\frac{a^4}{r^4}\\right)\\sin(2\\theta)\n$$\nFor our specific case of equibiaxial tension, we have $N_x = N_0$ and $N_y = N_0$. This implies that the term $N_x - N_y = 0$. The equations simplify considerably:\n$$\nN_{rr}(r,\\theta) = \\frac{N_0+N_0}{2}\\left(1-\\frac{a^2}{r^2}\\right) = N_0\\left(1-\\frac{a^2}{r^2}\\right)\n$$\n$$\nN_{\\theta\\theta}(r,\\theta) = \\frac{N_0+N_0}{2}\\left(1+\\frac{a^2}{r^2}\\right) = N_0\\left(1+\\frac{a^2}{r^2}\\right)\n$$\n$$\nN_{r\\theta}(r,\\theta) = 0\n$$\nThis solution correctly satisfies the boundary conditions at $r=a$ ($N_{rr} = N_0(1-1)=0$, $N_{r\\theta}=0$) and the far-field conditions as $r \\to \\infty$ ($N_{rr} \\to N_0$, $N_{\\theta\\theta} \\to N_0$).\n\nThe stress concentration factor $K_t$ is defined as the ratio of the maximum circumferential stress resultant at the edge of the hole to the far-field stress resultant $N_0$:\n$$\nK_t \\equiv \\frac{\\max_{\\theta}\\,N_{\\theta\\theta}(r=a,\\theta)}{N_{0}}\n$$\nWe evaluate $N_{\\theta\\theta}$ at the edge of the hole, $r=a$:\n$$\nN_{\\theta\\theta}(a,\\theta) = N_0\\left(1+\\frac{a^2}{a^2}\\right) = N_0(1+1) = 2N_0\n$$\nThe circumferential stress resultant at the edge of the hole is uniform, i.e., it is independent of the angle $\\theta$.
