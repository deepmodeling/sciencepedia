A solution will be furnished.\n\nThe solution proceeds by first determining the strain field from the prescribed kinematics and then using the constitutive equations to find the stress field.\n\nAccording to the kinematic assumptions of Kirchhoff-Love theory, the in-plane displacement components $u(x,y,z)$ and $v(x,y,z)$ at a distance $z$ from the mid-surface are related to the mid-surface deflections $w(x,y)$ by:\n$$\nu(x,y,z) = u_0(x,y) - z \\frac{\\partial w}{\\partial x}\n$$\n$$\nv(x,y,z) = v_0(x,y) - z \\frac{\\partial w}{\\partial y}\n$$\nwhere $u_0$ and $v_0$ are the in-plane displacements of the mid-surface ($z=0$). The problem specifies no net in-plane force resultants, which for this pure bending scenario implies that the mid-surface strains are zero. This is achieved by setting $u_0=0$ and $v_0=0$.\n\nThe linear strain components $\\epsilon_{xx}$, $\\epsilon_{yy}$, and $\\gamma_{xy}$ are derived from the displacement field:\n$$\n\\epsilon_{xx} = \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x} = -z \\frac{\\partial^{2} w}{\\partial x^{2}}\n$$\n$$\n\\epsilon_{yy} = \\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial y} = -z \\frac{\\partial^{2} w}{\\partial y^{2}}\n$$\n$$\n\\gamma_{xy} = \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial y} + \\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial x} = -2z \\frac{\\partial^{2} w}{\\partial x \\partial y}\n$$\nThe prescribed deflection is $w(x,y) = \\frac{1}{2} \\kappa x^{2}$.

The problem specifies a state of plane stress, meaning $\\sigma_{zz} = 0$. The general 3D Hooke's Law for an isotropic material simplifies under plane stress to the following for the in-plane strains:\n$$\n\\epsilon_{xx} = \\frac{1}{E} (\\sigma_{xx} - \\nu \\sigma_{yy})\n$$\n$$\n\\epsilon_{yy} = \\frac{1}{E} (\\sigma_{yy} - \\nu \\sigma_{xx})\n$$\nWe have a system of two equations for the two unknown stresses, $\\sigma_{xx}$ and $\\sigma_{yy}$. From the kinematic analysis, we know $\\epsilon_{yy}=0$. Substituting this into the second constitutive equation yields:\n$$\n0 = \\frac{1}{E} (\\sigma_{yy} - \\nu \\sigma_{xx}) \\implies \\sigma_{yy} = \\nu \\sigma_{xx}\n$$\nThis demonstrates that although the strain $\\epsilon_{yy}$ is zero, the stress $\\sigma_{yy}$ is not, due to the Poisson effect. Now, we substitute this relation into the first constitutive equation:\n$$\n\\epsilon_{xx} = \\frac{1}{E} (\\sigma_{xx} - \\nu (\\nu \\sigma_{xx})) = \\frac{\\sigma_{xx}}{E} (1 - \\nu^{2})\n$$\nSolving for $\\sigma_{xx}$ gives the stress in terms of the strain $\\epsilon_{xx}$:\n$$\n\\sigma_{xx} = \\frac{E}{1 - \\nu^{2}} \\epsilon_{xx}\n$$\nFinally, substituting the expression for the strain, $\\epsilon_{xx}(z) = -\\kappa z$, we obtain the stress distribution through the plate thickness. This completes the first task.\n$$\n\\sigma_{xx}(z) = - \\frac{E \\kappa z}{1 - \\nu^{2}}\n$$\nThis expression is linear in $z$, indicating compression ($\\sigma_{xx} < 0$) on the top side of the plate ($z > 0$) and tension ($\\sigma_{xx} > 0$) on the bottom side ($z < 0$) for an upward deflection ($\\kappa > 0$), which is physically correct. If numerical values were required, stress would be in pascals, provided $E$ is in pascals and all lengths are in meters.\n\nFor the second task, we verify this result. We form the resultant bending moment $M_x$ by integrating the stress distribution multiplied by the moment arm $z$ over the plate thickness:\n$$\nM_{x} = \\int_{-h/2}^{h/2} \\sigma_{xx}(z) z dz = \\int_{-h/2}^{h/2} \\left( - \\frac{E \\kappa z}{1 - \\nu^{2}} \\right) z dz\n$$\nThe terms independent of $z$ are moved outside the integral:\n$$\nM_{x} = - \\frac{E \\kappa}{1 - \\nu^{2}} \\int_{-h/2}^{h/2} z^{2} dz\n$$\nThe integral evaluates to the second moment of area of a unit-width rectangular cross-section about its centroidal axis:\n$$\n\\int_{-h/2}^{h/2} z^{2} dz = \\left[ \\frac{z^{3}}{3} \\right]_{-h/2}^{h/2} = \\frac{1}{3} \\left( \\left(\\frac{h}{2}\\right)^{3} - \\left(-\\frac{h}{2}\\right)^{3} \\right) = \\frac{1}{3} \\left( \\frac{h^{3}}{8} + \\frac{h^{3}}{8} \\right) = \\frac{h^{3}}{12}\n$$\nSubstituting this result back gives the moment resultant:\n$$\nM_{x} = - \\frac{E \\kappa}{1 - \\nu^{2}} \\left( \\frac{h^{3}}{12} \\right) = - \\frac{E h^{3}}{12(1 - \\nu^{2})} \\kappa\n$$\nNow, we compare this with the standard moment-curvature constitutive relation from classical plate theory:\n$$\nM_{x} = -D \\left( \\frac{\\partial^{2} w}{\\partial x^{2}} + \\nu \\frac{\\partial^{2} w}{\\partial y^{2}} \\right)\n$$\nwhere $D = \\frac{E h^{3}}{12(1 - \\nu^{2})}$ is the flexural rigidity of the plate.

It is a standard problem in the theory of plates, designed to compare a simplified one-dimensional ($1$D) beam model with a more rigorous two-dimensional ($2$D) plate model under the condition of cylindrical bending. We shall proceed with the solution in two parts, as requested.\n\nThe fundamental sign convention for this analysis will be: downward transverse load $q$ is positive, downward deflection $w$ is positive, and a bending moment is positive if it produces tension on the bottom fiber of the plate (sagging). The plate mid-plane is at $z=0$, with $z$ positive upwards. Therefore, tension on the bottom fiber corresponds to $\\sigma_x > 0$ for $z<0$.

A positive bending moment $M_x$ is given by $M_x = \\int_{-h/2}^{h/2} \\sigma_x z dz$.\n\nFirst, we establish the governing equilibrium equations. For a plate element under a transverse load $q$, with fields independent of $y$, the equilibrium equations from plate theory are:\n$$\n\\frac{dQ_x}{dx} + q = 0\n$$\n$$\nQ_x = \\frac{dM_x}{dx}\n$$\nCombining these two equations yields a direct relationship between the bending moment $M_x$ and the applied load $q$:\n$$\n\\frac{d^2M_x}{dx^2} + q = 0\n$$\nThis second-order ordinary differential equation governs the bending moment $M_x(x)$. The boundary conditions for a simply supported plate with no applied edge moments are $M_x(0) = 0$ and $M_x(a) = 0$. This boundary value problem for $M_x(x)$ is statically determinate, meaning its solution depends only on equilibrium and not on the material's constitutive law. Integrating twice gives:\n$$\n\\frac{dM_x}{dx} = -qx + C_1\n$$\n$$\nM_x(x) = -\\frac{q}{2}x^2 + C_1 x + C_2\n$$\nApplying the boundary conditions:\n$M_x(0) = 0 \\implies C_2 = 0$.\n$M_x(a) = 0 \\implies -\\frac{q}{2}a^2 + C_1 a = 0 \\implies C_1 = \\frac{qa}{2}$.\nThus, the bending moment distribution is:\n$$\nM_x(x) = \\frac{q}{2}(ax - x^2)\n$$\nAnd the transverse shear resultant is:\n$$\nQ_x(x) = \\frac{dM_x}{dx} = \\frac{q}{2}(a - 2x)\n$$\nThese results are derived from equilibrium alone and must hold for any valid constitutive model used for the plate. The problem, however, asks to derive these results starting from the deflection $w(x)$, which we shall now do for each model to confirm consistency.\n\nPart 1: The 1D Plate Strip Model\nThis model approximates the plate strip as an Euler-Bernoulli beam of unit width. This implies a state of uniaxial stress, where $\\sigma_y = \\sigma_z = 0$. The stress-strain relation is $\\sigma_x = E\\epsilon_x$.\nThe moment-curvature relation is derived as:\n$M_x = \\int_{-h/2}^{h/2} \\sigma_x z dz = \\int_{-h/2}^{h/2} (E\\epsilon_x) z dz = \\int_{-h/2}^{h/2} E(z\\frac{d^2w}{dx^2}) z dz = E\\frac{d^2w}{dx^2} \\int_{-h/2}^{h/2} z^2 dz = E\\frac{h^3}{12}\\frac{d^2w}{dx^2}$.\nHere, the convention for moment is $M_x = D \\frac{d^2w}{dx^2}$.\nWe define the strip flexural rigidity as $D_{\\text{strip}} = \\frac{Eh^3}{12}$. Thus, $M_x(x) = D_{\\text{strip}} \\frac{d^2w}{dx^2}$.\nThe governing equation for the deflection $w(x)$ is obtained by substituting this into the equilibrium equation $\\frac{d^2M_x}{dx^2} = -q$:\n$$\nD_{\\text{strip}}\\frac{d^4w}{dx^4} = q\n$$\nThe boundary conditions are $w(0)=w(a)=0$ and $M_x(0)=M_x(a)=0$, which implies $\\frac{d^2w}{dx^2}(0)=\\frac{d^2w}{dx^2}(a)=0$.\nIntegrating the governing equation four times and applying the boundary conditions yields the deflection:\n$$\nw(x) = \\frac{q}{24D_{\\text{strip}}}(x^4 - 2ax^3 + a^3x)\n$$\nFrom this, we find the bending moment $M_{x}^{(\\text{strip})}$:\n$$\nM_{x}^{(\\text{strip})}(x) = D_{\\text{strip}}\\frac{d^2w}{dx^2} = D_{\\text{strip}}\\frac{q}{24D_{\\text{strip}}}(12x^2 - 12ax) = \\frac{q}{2}(x^2 - ax)\n$$\nRevisiting the solution of $M_x'' = -q$ gives $M_x(x) = \\frac{q}{2}(ax - x^2)$. The sign is opposite. This is due to inconsistent sign conventions between the equilibrium derivation and the constitutive derivation. Let's use the plate convention $M_x = -D w''$. Then $D w''''=q$ becomes consistent. The solution for $M_x$ from $w$ becomes $M_x = -D\\frac{q}{24D}(12x^2-12ax) = \\frac{q}{2}(ax-x^2)$.\nAnd the shear resultant $Q_{x}^{(\\text{strip})}$:\n$$\nQ_{x}^{(\\text{strip})}(x) = \\frac{dM_{x}^{(\\text{strip})}}{dx} = \\frac{q}{2}(a - 2x)\n$$\nThese expressions match those derived from static equilibrium.\n\nPart 2: The 2D Kirchhoff-Love Plate Model\nFor a long plate with fields independent of $y$, the deflection is $w=w(x)$. This kinematic condition implies that the strain in the $y$-direction is zero, $\\epsilon_y = \\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial y} = 0$. This is a state of plane strain. The stress-strain relations are $\\epsilon_x = \\frac{1}{E}(\\sigma_x - \\nu\\sigma_y)$ and $\\epsilon_y = \\frac{1}{E}(\\sigma_y - \\nu\\sigma_x) = 0$, which gives $\\sigma_y = \\nu\\sigma_x$.\nThe moment-curvature relations for a 2D plate are $M_x = -D(\\frac{\\partial^2 w}{\\partial x^2} + \\nu \\frac{\\partial^2 w}{\\partial y^2})$ and $M_y = -D(\\frac{\\partial^2 w}{\\partial y^2} + \\nu \\frac{\\partial^2 w}{\\partial x^2})$, where the flexural rigidity is $D = \\frac{Eh^3}{12(1-\\nu^2)}$.\nFor $w=w(x)$, these simplify to:\n$$\nM_x = -D\\frac{d^2w}{dx^2}\n$$\nThe governing equation for the plate, $D \\nabla^4 w = q$, reduces to:\n$$\nD\\frac{d^4w}{dx^4} = q\n$$\nThe boundary conditions are identical in form: $w(0)=w(a)=0$ and $M_x(0)=M_x(a)=0$, which again implies $\\frac{d^2w}{dx^2}(0)=\\frac{d^2w}{dx^2}(a)=0$.\nThe entire boundary value problem is structurally identical to that in Part 1. The solution for deflection is:\n$$\nw(x) = \\frac{q}{24D}(x^4 - 2ax^3 + a^3x)\n$$\nNote that the deflection differs from the strip model by a factor of $D_{\\text{strip}}/D = 1-\\nu^2$.\nFrom this deflection, we compute the bending moment $M_{x}^{(2\\text{D})}(x)$:\n$$\nM_{x}^{(2\\text{D})}(x) = -D\\frac{d^2w}{dx^2} = -D\\frac{q}{24D}(12x^2 - 12ax) = \\frac{q}{2}(ax - x^2)\n$$\nThis result is identical to the one obtained for the strip model. Consequently, the shear resultant $Q_{x}^{(2\\text{D})}(x)$ is also identical.\n\nFinal Computation\nWe are asked to compute the ratio $R \\equiv \\frac{M_{x}^{(\\text{strip})}\\!\\left(\\frac{a}{2}\\right)}{M_{x}^{(2\\text{D})}\\!\\left(\\frac{a}{2}\\right)}$.\nFirst, we evaluate the bending moment at the center of the plate, $x=a/2$:\n$$\nM_{x}^{(\\text{strip})}\\!\\left(\\frac{a}{2}\\right) = \\frac{q}{2}\\left(a\\left(\\frac{a}{2}\\right) - \\left(\\frac{a}{2}\\right)^2\\right) = \\frac{q}{2}\\left(\\frac{a^2}{2} - \\frac{a^2}{4}\\right) = \\frac{qa^2}{8}\n$$\n$$\nM_{x}^{(2\\text{D})}\\!\\left(\\frac{a}{2}\\right) = \\frac{q}{2}\\left(a\\left(\\frac{a}{2}\\right) - \\left(\\frac{a}{2}\\right)^2\\right) = \\frac{q}{2}\\left(\\frac{a^2}{2} - \\frac{a^2}{4}\\right) = \\frac{qa^2}{8}\n$$\nBoth models yield the same expression for the bending moment resultant, as the problem is statically determinate for $M_x(x)$. The difference between the models manifests in the deflections and stresses, but not in the moment resultant for these specific boundary conditions.\nThe ratio is therefore:\n$$\nR = \\frac{\\frac{qa^2}{8}}{\\frac{qa^2}{8}} = 1\n$$", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{1}\n$$", "id": "2691460"}, {"introduction": "Beyond quantitative calculation, a deep understanding of physics often comes from qualitative reasoning.

Therefore, the sign of $M_{xy}(x,y)$ is opposite to the sign of the mixed partial derivative $\\frac{\\partial^2 w}{\\partial x \\partial y}$, which represents the twist curvature of the plate surface.\n\nThe problem features a high degree of symmetry. The geometry (square), the boundary conditions (simply supported on all sides), and the loading (uniform) are all symmetric with respect to reflections about the plate's midlines, $x=a/2$ and $y=a/2$. This symmetry of the problem setup dictates that the solution for the deflection, $w(x,y)$, must also possess these symmetries.\n\nLet us analyze the consequences of the symmetry with respect to the line $x=a/2$. This symmetry means that the deflection at a point $(a/2 - \\delta, y)$ is the same as at its reflection $(a/2 + \\delta, y)$:\n$$w(a/2 - \\delta, y) = w(a/2 + \\delta, y)$$\nfor any $0 \\le \\delta \\le a/2$. In other words, $w(x,y)$ is an even function of the coordinate $x$ about the line $x=a/2$.\n\nLet's consider the partial derivative of $w$ with respect to $y$, which we denote as $v(x,y) = \\frac{\\partial w}{\\partial y}$. Differentiating the symmetry relation with respect to $y$, we find:\n$$\\frac{\\partial w}{\\partial y}(a/2 - \\delta, y) = \\frac{\\partial w}{\\partial y}(a/2 + \\delta, y)$$\nThis shows that $v(x,y)$ is also an even function of $x$ about the line $x=a/2$.\n\nNow, let's consider the derivative of $v(x,y)$ with respect to $x$. The derivative of an even function is an odd function. Therefore, $\\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial x} = \\frac{\\partial^2 w}{\\partial x \\partial y}$ must be an odd function of $x$ about the line $x=a/2$. An odd function $f(\\xi)$ about $\\xi=0$ satisfies $f(-\\xi) = -f(\\xi)$, which implies $f(0)=0$. For our case, centered at $x=a/2$, this means:\n$$\\frac{\\partial^2 w}{\\partial x \\partial y}\\bigg|_{x=a/2} = 0$$\nFurthermore, being an odd function implies that $\\frac{\\partial^2 w}{\\partial x \\partial y}$ changes sign upon crossing the line $x=a/2$.\n\nBy an identical argument, the symmetry of the problem with respect to the line $y=a/2$ implies that $w(x,y)$ is an even function of $y$ about $y=a/2$. Consequently, $\\frac{\\partial^2 w}{\\partial x \\partial y}$ must be an odd function of $y$ about the line $y=a/2$. This leads to the conclusion that:\n$$\\frac{\\partial^2 w}{\\partial x \\partial y}\\bigg|_{y=a/2} = 0$$\nand that $\\frac{\\partial^2 w}{\\partial x \\partial y}$ changes sign upon crossing the line $y=a/2$.\n\nSince $M_{xy}$ is directly proportional to $-\\frac{\\partial^2 w}{\\partial x \\partial y}$, it follows that $M_{xy}$ must vanish on both midlines, $x=a/2$ and $y=a/2$, and must change sign upon crossing either of these lines.\n\nTo determine the sign of $M_{xy}$ in the four quadrants defined by these midlines, we can examine the behavior of the plate near a corner, for example, the corner at $(0,0)$. The plate is supported at the edges but loaded downwards in the interior. This causes the corners to have a tendency to lift up. To maintain zero deflection on the supports, downward reaction forces must act at the corners. These corner forces are generated by the twisting moments. A downward force at the corner $(0,0)$ requires $M_{xy}$ to be negative there. A more formal way is to analyze the solution for $w(x,y)$ obtained via a double Fourier series (Navier's solution), which satisfies the simply supported boundary conditions ($w=0, M_n=0$ on the boundary):\n$$w(x,y) = \\sum_{m=1,3,...}^{\\infty} \\sum_{n=1,3,...}^{\\infty} W_{mn} \\sin\\left(\\frac{m\\pi x}{a}\\right) \\sin\\left(\\frac{n\\pi y}{a}\\right)$$\nwhere the coefficients $W_{mn}$ are positive for a downward load $q>0$. Taking the mixed partial derivative:\n$$\\frac{\\partial^2 w}{\\partial x \\partial y} = \\sum_{m,n \\text{ odd}} W_{mn} \\left(\\frac{m\\pi}{a}\\right)\\left(\\frac{n\\pi}{a}\\right) \\cos\\left(\\frac{m\\pi x}{a}\\right) \\cos\\left(\\frac{n\\pi y}{a}\\right)$$\nIn the first quadrant, $\\{0 < x < a/2, 0 < y < a/2\\}$, the arguments of the cosine functions are in the interval $(0, \\pi/2)$. Thus, $\\cos(\\frac{m\\pi x}{a}) > 0$ and $\\cos(\\frac{n\\pi y}{a}) > 0$ for all $m,n$. Since $W_{mn}$ are all positive, the entire sum is positive. Therefore, $\\frac{\\partial^2 w}{\\partial x \\partial y} > 0$ in this quadrant.\nThis implies $M_{xy} = -D(1-\\nu)\\frac{\\partial^2 w}{\\partial x \\partial y} < 0$.\n\nFrom the odd symmetry property of $M_{xy}$ about the midlines, the full sign distribution is:\n-   In quadrant $\\{0<x<a/2, 0<y<a/2\\}$: $M_{xy} < 0$.\n-   In quadrant $\\{a/2<x<a, 0<y<a/2\\}$: $M_{xy}$ must have the opposite sign to the adjacent quadrant, so $M_{xy} > 0$.\n-   In quadrant $\\{0<x<a/2, a/2<y<a\\}$: $M_{xy}$ must have the opposite sign, so $M_{xy} > 0$.\n-   In quadrant $\\{a/2<x<a, a/2<y<a\\}$: $M_{xy}$ must be negative, being opposite in sign to its neighbors.\n\nFinally, we consider the behavior across the diagonals. The problem's symmetries also include reflections about the diagonals $y=x$ and $y=a-x$. Symmetry about $y=x$ implies that $w(x,y) = w(y,x)$. Differentiating this relation gives $\\frac{\\partial^2 w(x,y)}{\\partial x \\partial y} = \\frac{\\partial^2 w(y,x)}{\\partial y \\partial x}$. This means the value of the mixed derivative at a point $(x,y)$ is the same as at its reflection $(y,x)$. Thus, the function $\\frac{\\partial^2 w}{\\partial x \\partial y}$ is symmetric with respect to the line $y=x$. This implies $M_{xy}$ is also symmetric, i.e., $M_{xy}(x,y) = M_{xy}(y,x)$. A function that is symmetric with respect to a line is not, in general, zero on that line, nor does it necessarily change sign. Therefore, there is no symmetry requirement for $M_{xy}$ to vanish or change sign on the diagonals.\n\n**Option-by-Option Analysis**\n\n-   **A**: This statement claims $M_{xy}$ vanishes along the diagonals and changes sign. This is incorrect. The symmetry is of an even type, not odd, with respect to the diagonals. It also incorrectly states the signs in the triangular regions. **Incorrect**.\n\n-   **B**: This statement correctly identifies that $M_{xy}$ vanishes on the midlines $x=a/2$ and $y=a/2$ and changes sign across them, due to mirror symmetries. It correctly states the sign distribution: $M_{xy}<0$ in the bottom-left and top-right quadrants, and $M_{xy}>0$ in the other two. It also correctly states that there is no symmetry requirement for $M_{xy}$ to vanish or change sign across the diagonals. This aligns perfectly with our derivation. **Correct**.\n\n-   **C**: This statement claims $M_{xy}$ is identically zero. This is a naive interpretation of symmetry and is incorrect. The series solution explicitly shows that $M_{xy}$ is non-zero. For instance, at the corners, $M_{xy}$ takes on its maximum absolute values. **Incorrect**.\n\n-   **D**: This statement claims $M_{xy}=0$ along the simply supported edges. This is false; the Fourier series for $M_{xy}$ on an edge is not identically zero. It also incorrectly claims there is no interior line where $M_{xy}$ must vanish, contradicting the proven fact that it vanishes on the midlines $x=a/2$ and $y=a/2$. **Incorrect**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2691494"}]}
