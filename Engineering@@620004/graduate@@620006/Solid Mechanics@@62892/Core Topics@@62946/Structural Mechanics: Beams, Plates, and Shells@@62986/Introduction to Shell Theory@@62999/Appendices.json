This implies that transverse shear strains and the normal strain in the thickness direction are zero. The in-plane components of the Green-Lagrange strain tensor, denoted by $\\varepsilon_{\\alpha\\beta}$ (where Greek indices $\\alpha, \\beta$ range over $\\{1,2\\}$), at a distance $z$ from the mid-surface are linearly related to the mid-surface membrane strains $\\varepsilon^{0}_{\\alpha\\beta}$ and the changes in curvature $\\kappa_{\\alpha\\beta}$. In the context of small strains and small rotations, this relationship is:\n    $$\n    \\varepsilon_{\\alpha\\beta}(z) = \\varepsilon^{0}_{\\alpha\\beta} + z \\kappa_{\\alpha\\beta}\n    $$\n    Here, $z \\in [-h/2, h/2]$, where $h$ is the uniform shell thickness.\n\n2.  **Constitutive Law for Plane Stress**\n    The problem specifies a three-dimensional, linearly elastic, isotropic material. For such a material, the general form of Hooke's law is $\\sigma_{ij} = C_{ijkl}\\varepsilon_{kl}$. The problem also imposes the plane-stress condition, $\\sigma_{33}=0$. Under this condition, the relationship between in-plane stresses $\\sigma_{\\alpha\\beta}$ and in-plane strains $\\varepsilon_{\\alpha\\beta}$ simplifies. Starting from the 3D strain-stress relations $\\varepsilon_{ij} = \\frac{1+\\nu}{E}\\sigma_{ij} - \\frac{\\nu}{E}\\sigma_{kk}\\delta_{ij}$:\n    For the $\\varepsilon_{33}$ component, with $\\sigma_{33}=0$:\n    $$\n    \\varepsilon_{33} = \\frac{1}{E}(0 - \\nu(\\sigma_{11} + \\sigma_{22})) = -\\frac{\\nu}{E}\\sigma_{\\gamma\\gamma}\n    $$\n    The in-plane strain components are given by:\n    $$\n    \\varepsilon_{\\alpha\\beta} = \\frac{1+\\nu}{E}\\sigma_{\\alpha\\beta} - \\frac{\\nu}{E}\\sigma_{\\gamma\\gamma}\\delta_{\\alpha\\beta}\n    $$\n    Inverting this relationship to express stresses in terms of strains yields the plane-stress constitutive law:\n    $$\n    \\sigma_{\\alpha\\beta} = \\frac{E}{1-\\nu^2} \\left[ (1-\\nu)\\varepsilon_{\\alpha\\beta} + \\nu\\varepsilon_{\\gamma\\gamma}\\delta_{\\alpha\\beta} \\right]\n    $$\n    This can be written in indicial notation as $\\sigma_{\\alpha\\beta} = C^{PS}_{\\alpha\\beta\\gamma\\delta}\\varepsilon_{\\gamma\\delta}$, where the fourth-order plane-stress stiffness tensor $C^{PS}_{\\alpha\\beta\\gamma\\delta}$ is given by:\n    $$\n    C^{PS}_{\\alpha\\beta\\gamma\\delta} = \\frac{E}{2(1+\\nu)} \\left( \\delta_{\\alpha\\gamma}\\delta_{\\beta\\delta} + \\delta_{\\alpha\\delta}\\delta_{\\beta\\gamma} \\right) + \\frac{E\\nu}{(1+\\nu)(1-\\nu)} \\delta_{\\alpha\\beta}\\delta_{\\gamma\\delta}\n    $$\n    Note that this tensor is constant because the material is homogeneous.\n\n3.  **Stress Distribution Through the Thickness**\n    By substituting the kinematic relation from step 1 into the plane-stress constitutive law from step 2, we obtain the stress distribution through the thickness as a function of the mid-surface generalized strains:\n    $$\n    \\sigma_{\\alpha\\beta}(z) = C^{PS}_{\\alpha\\beta\\gamma\\delta} \\varepsilon_{\\gamma\\delta}(z) = C^{PS}_{\\alpha\\beta\\gamma\\delta} (\\varepsilon^{0}_{\\gamma\\delta} + z \\kappa_{\\gamma\\delta})\n    $$\n\n4.  **Derivation of Stress Resultants and Moments**\n    The stress resultants (membrane forces) $N_{\\alpha\\beta}$ and bending moments $M_{\\alpha\\beta}$ are defined by integrating the stresses and the first moment of stresses through the shell thickness:\n    $$\n    N_{\\alpha\\beta} = \\int_{-h/2}^{h/2} \\sigma_{\\alpha\\beta}(z) \\, \\mathrm{d}z\n    $$\n    $$\n    M_{\\alpha\\beta} = \\int_{-h/2}^{h/2} z \\sigma_{\\alpha\\beta}(z) \\, \\mathrm{d}z\n    $$\n    Substituting the expression for $\\sigma_{\\alpha\\beta}(z)$:\n    $$\n    N_{\\alpha\\beta} = \\int_{-h/2}^{h/2} C^{PS}_{\\alpha\\beta\\gamma\\delta} (\\varepsilon^{0}_{\\gamma\\delta} + z \\kappa_{\\gamma\\delta}) \\, \\mathrm{d}z = C^{PS}_{\\alpha\\beta\\gamma\\delta} \\left( \\varepsilon^{0}_{\\gamma\\delta} \\int_{-h/2}^{h/2} \\mathrm{d}z + \\kappa_{\\gamma\\delta} \\int_{-h/2}^{h/2} z \\, \\mathrm{d}z \\right)\n    $$\n    $$\n    M_{\\alpha\\beta} = \\int_{-h/2}^{h/2} z C^{PS}_{\\alpha\\beta\\gamma\\delta} (\\varepsilon^{0}_{\\gamma\\delta} + z \\kappa_{\\gamma\\delta}) \\, \\mathrm{d}z = C^{PS}_{\\alpha\\beta\\gamma\\delta} \\left( \\varepsilon^{0}_{\\gamma\\delta} \\int_{-h/2}^{h/2} z \\, \\mathrm{d}z + \\kappa_{\\gamma\\delta} \\int_{-h/2}^{h/2} z^2 \\, \\mathrm{d}z \\right)\n    $$\n    The required integrals are:\n    $$\n    \\int_{-h/2}^{h/2} 1 \\, \\mathrm{d}z = h\n    $$\n    $$\n    \\int_{-h/2}^{h/2} z \\, \\mathrm{d}z = 0\n    $$\n    $$\n    \\int_{-h/2}^{h/2} z^2 \\, \\mathrm{d}z = \\left[\\frac{z^3}{3}\\right]_{-h/2}^{h/2} = \\frac{h^3}{24} - \\left(-\\frac{h^3}{24}\\right) = \\frac{h^3}{12}\n    $$\n    The vanishing of the integral of $z$ over the symmetric domain $[-h/2, h/2]$ demonstrates that for a homogeneous shell (where $C^{PS}$ is independent of $z$) with a geometrically symmetric cross-section, the membrane-bending coupling is zero.\n    Substituting the values of the integrals, we obtain the 2D constitutive relations:\n    $$\n    N_{\\alpha\\beta} = (h C^{PS}_{\\alpha\\beta\\gamma\\delta}) \\varepsilon^{0}_{\\gamma\\delta}\n    $$\n    $$\n    M_{\\alpha\\beta} = \\left(\\frac{h^3}{12} C^{PS}_{\\alpha\\beta\\gamma\\delta}\\right) \\kappa_{\\gamma\\delta}\n    $$\n    Comparing these to the forms required by the problem statement, $N_{\\alpha\\beta} = A_{\\alpha\\beta\\gamma\\delta}\\varepsilon^{0}_{\\gamma\\delta}$ and $M_{\\alpha\\beta} = D_{\\alpha\\beta\\gamma\\delta}\\kappa_{\\gamma\\delta}$, we identify the membrane stiffness tensor $A_{\\alpha\\beta\\gamma\\delta}$ and the bending stiffness tensor $D_{\\alpha\\beta\\gamma\\delta}$:\n    $$\n    A_{\\alpha\\beta\\gamma\\delta} = h C^{PS}_{\\alpha\\beta\\gamma\\delta}\n    $$\n    $$\n    D_{\\alpha\\beta\\gamma\\delta} = \\frac{h^3}{12} C^{PS}_{\\alpha\\beta\\gamma\\delta}\n    $$\n\n5.  **Voigt Notation Representation**\n    To express these relations in matrix form, we use Voigt notation.

This problem [@problem_id:2650142] addresses a critical numerical pathology known as 'shear locking' that arises in thin Reissner-Mindlin shell elements. Diagnosing this issue is essential for any practitioner, as it reveals the subtle but crucial interplay between the physical assumptions of your model and the interpolation scheme used to approximate it.", "problem": "A thin, isotropic shell is modeled with the Reissner–Mindlin kinematics, in which the mid-surface fields are the in-plane displacements, the transverse deflection $w(x,y)$, and the independent rotations $\\theta_x(x,y)$ and $\\theta_y(x,y)$ of the normal fiber. The transverse shear strain components are defined by the kinematic relations $\\gamma_{xz} = \\theta_x - \\partial w/\\partial x$ and $\\gamma_{yz} = \\theta_y - \\partial w/\\partial y$. Consider a pure cylindrical bending state of a flat panel in which the exact continuum solution satisfies the Kirchhoff–Love thin limit $\\gamma_{xz} = \\gamma_{yz} = 0$ everywhere as the thickness $t \\to 0$. The strain energy densities scale as bending energy $\\sim E\\, t^3$ and transverse shear energy $\\sim G\\, t$, where $E$ is Young’s modulus and $G$ is the shear modulus. \n\nA low-order four-node quadrilateral ($Q_4$) Mindlin shell finite element uses bilinear interpolation for $w$, $\\theta_x$, and $\\theta_y$. In a mesh of such elements, consider approximating the cylindrical bending field by nodal interpolation. From first principles, assess the discrete mechanism that can lead to an overly stiff response (locking) in the thin limit, and identify effective numerical remedies.\n\nWhich option most accurately identifies the mechanism of shear locking in this setting and proposes appropriate remedies?\n\nA. Shear locking occurs because, with equal-order bilinear interpolation for $w$, $\\theta_x$, and $\\theta_y$, the discrete field cannot enforce $\\gamma_{xz} = \\theta_x - \\partial w/\\partial x = 0$ and $\\gamma_{yz} = \\theta_y - \\partial w/\\partial y = 0$ pointwise in pure bending; spurious nonzero $\\gamma$ are then penalized by the shear energy, which scales as $G\\, t$ and dominates bending as $t \\to 0$, yielding an artificially stiff response. Remedies include selective or reduced integration applied to the shear terms to soften the spurious constraint, assumed-strain or mixed methods (such as Assumed Natural Strain or Mixed Interpolation of Tensorial Components) that reconstruct compatible shear strains, and the use of higher-order or mixed interpolation to satisfy the thin limit $\\gamma \\to 0$.\n\nB. Shear locking is caused by under-integration that introduces zero-energy shear modes; the correct remedy is to fully integrate all terms so that all shear modes are stabilized, which removes locking in the thin limit.\n\nC.

There are no contradictions.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem statement is valid. A complete solution will be derived.\n\n### Derivation and Analysis\nThe Reissner-Mindlin theory for plates avoids the C1-continuity requirement on the transverse deflection $w$ by treating the rotations of the normal, $\\theta_x$ and $\\theta_y$, as independent degrees of freedom. The transverse shear strains are given by $\\gamma_{xz} = \\theta_x - \\partial w/\\partial x$ and $\\gamma_{yz} = \\theta_y - \\partial w/\\partial y$. The total strain energy $U$ of the plate is the sum of the bending energy $U_b$ and the shear energy $U_s$.\n$$U = U_b + U_s$$\nThe energy densities scale with thickness $t$ as provided: the bending energy $U_b$ is proportional to $t^3$, while the shear energy $U_s$ is proportional to $t$.\n$$U \\approx c_b E t^3 \\int_\\Omega (\\kappa)^2 dA + c_s G t \\int_\\Omega (\\gamma)^2 dA$$\nwhere $\\kappa$ represents curvature terms and $\\gamma$ represents transverse shear strains.\n\nIn the thin plate limit ($t \\to 0$), for the total energy to remain finite and for the solution to be physically meaningful, the shear strain energy must not dominate the bending energy. This means the shear strains must vanish, i.e., $\\gamma_{xz} \\to 0$ and $\\gamma_{yz} \\to 0$. This recovers the kinematic constraint of the Kirchhoff-Love theory. A robust finite element formulation must be able to satisfy this constraint in the thin limit without becoming artificially stiff.\n\nLet us examine the specified four-node quadrilateral ($Q_4$) element. For this element, the fields $w$, $\\theta_x$, and $\\theta_y$ are interpolated from their nodal values using the same set of bilinear shape functions $N_i(\\xi, \\eta)$:\n$$w(\\xi, \\eta) = \\sum_{i=1}^4 N_i(\\xi, \\eta) w_i$$\n$$\\theta_x(\\xi, \\eta) = \\sum_{i=1}^4 N_i(\\xi, \\eta) \\theta_{xi}$$\n$$\\theta_y(\\xi, \\eta) = \\sum_{i=1}^4 N_i(\\xi, \\eta) \\theta_{yi}$$\nLet us consider a pure cylindrical bending state about the $y$-axis. The exact solution has the form:\n$$w(x) = C x^2$$\n$$\\theta_x(x) = \\frac{\\partial w}{\\partial x} = 2 C x$$\n$$\\theta_y(x) = 0$$\nIn this state, $\\gamma_{xz} = \\theta_x - \\partial w/\\partial x = 0$ is satisfied exactly everywhere.\n\nNow, consider how the $Q_4$ element attempts to represent this state. The deflection $w$ is quadratic, while the interpolation $w^h = \\sum N_i w_i$ is only bilinear. The rotation $\\theta_x$ is linear, which *can* be represented by a bilinear interpolation. However, the derivative of the interpolated deflection, $\\partial w^h/\\partial x$, is generally not a field that can match the interpolated rotation $\\theta_x^h$.\n\nTo be more concrete, consider a rectangular element. The derivative $\\partial w^h/\\partial x$ is linear in the local coordinate $\\eta$, while $\\theta_x^h$ is bilinear in both $\\xi$ and $\\eta$. There is a fundamental mismatch between the space of interpolated rotations and the space of derivatives of the interpolated deflection. Consequently, even if we set the nodal values to match the exact pure bending solution, the element will develop spurious, non-zero shear strains $\\gamma_{xz}^h = \\theta_x^h - \\partial w^h/\\partial x \\neq 0$ inside the element.\n\nThis spurious shear strain $\\gamma^h$ is penalized by the shear energy term $U_s$. As $t \\to 0$, the factor $G t$ (or more accurately, the shear stiffness matrix entries which scale with $G t$) becomes very large compared to the bending stiffness (which scales with $E t^3$). The finite element system, in an attempt to minimize the total energy, will strongly suppress *any* deformation that produces non-zero shear strains. Because the element cannot represent pure bending without generating spurious shear strains, it will resist bending deformation altogether. This results in an overly stiff response known as **shear locking**. The element locks into a state of near-zero bending.\n\nEffective remedies aim to break this artificial constraint. These include:\n1.  **Selective Reduced Integration (SRI)**: The spurious shear strains are often oscillatory and vanish at specific points. By evaluating the shear energy term using a lower-order integration rule (e.g., one-point Gauss quadrature for a $Q_4$ element) while fully integrating the bending term, the effect of the spurious strains is nullified, thus \"unlocking\" the element.\n2.  **Assumed Strain Methods**: These methods modify the kinematic formulation. Instead of using the shear strains derived directly from the displacements, a separate, lower-order shear strain field is interpolated (or \"assumed\"). This new field is constructed to be compatible with the bending behavior and to eliminate spurious modes. Examples include the Assumed Natural Strain (ANS) and Mixed Interpolation of Tensorial Components (MITC) methods.\n3.  **Higher-Order or Mixed Interpolation**: Using different (mixed) interpolation orders for the fields can enforce the required kinematic consistency. For example, using quadratic interpolation for rotations but a lower-order, compatible interpolation for the transverse shear (related to the derivatives of $w$) can satisfy the constraint. Higher-order elements themselves can be less prone to locking.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. Shear locking occurs because, with equal-order bilinear interpolation for $w$, $\\theta_x$, and $\\theta_y$, the discrete field cannot enforce $\\gamma_{xz} = \\theta_x - \\partial w/\\partial x = 0$ and $\\gamma_{yz} = \\theta_y - \\partial w/\\partial y = 0$ pointwise in pure bending; spurious nonzero $\\gamma$ are then penalized by the shear energy, which scales as $G\\, t$ and dominates bending as $t \\to 0$, yielding an artificially stiff response. Remedies include selective or reduced integration applied to the shear terms to soften the spurious constraint, assumed-strain or mixed methods (such as Assumed Natural Strain or Mixed Interpolation of Tensorial Components) that reconstruct compatible shear strains, and the use of higher-order or mixed interpolation to satisfy the thin limit $\\gamma \\to 0$.**\n\nThis statement is entirely consistent with the derivation above. It correctly identifies the cause (kinematic inconsistency from equal-order interpolation), the mechanism (penalty effect from shear energy in the thin limit), and the standard, effective classes of remedies (SRI, assumed strain/mixed methods, higher/mixed-order elements).\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. Shear locking is caused by under-integration that introduces zero-energy shear modes; the correct remedy is to fully integrate all terms so that all shear modes are stabilized, which removes locking in the thin limit.**\n\nThis statement reverses cause and effect. Under-integration (specifically, reduced integration for the shear terms) is a *remedy* for shear locking, not its cause. Full integration is what *activates* the locking mechanism by evaluating and penalizing the spurious shear strains. While under-integration can indeed introduce spurious zero-energy modes (hourglassing), this is an entirely different numerical problem that requires separate stabilization, and it is not the cause of locking.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. The mechanism is the Kirchhoff–Love hypothesis that normals remain orthogonal to the mid-surface, which is built into the Reissner–Mindlin kinematics, and becomes invalid for thick shells; increasing the effective shear modulus $G$ as $t \\to 0$ removes the locking.**\n\nThis statement contains multiple fundamental errors. The Reissner-Mindlin theory *relaxes* the Kirchhoff-Love hypothesis by allowing independent rotations, thus permitting transverse shear strain ($\\gamma \\neq 0$). Locking occurs because the finite element formulation *fails* to reproduce the Kirchhoff-Love limit ($\\gamma \\to 0$) in pure bending for thin plates. Furthermore, increasing the shear modulus $G$ would *exacerbate* locking, not remove it, as it increases the penalty on the spurious shear strains.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. Locking is due to membrane–bending coupling induced by curvature in shells; making the coordinate lines orthogonal to eliminate the coupling removes the locking without any change to shear interpolation or integration.**\n\nThis describes membrane locking, a different phenomenon that occurs in *curved* shell elements when the formulation cannot represent a pure bending state without inducing spurious membrane strains. The problem explicitly states we are considering a *flat panel*, so there is no initial curvature and thus no membrane-bending coupling of this type. The issue at hand is shear locking.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**E. Shear locking appears because essential boundary conditions inadvertently set $\\theta_x = \\partial w/\\partial x$ and $\\theta_y = \\partial w/\\partial y$ at the boundary; relaxing these boundary constraints eliminates locking, so no changes to element formulation or integration are necessary.**\n\nShear locking is an inherent pathology of the element's formulation (its interpolation scheme) and manifests throughout the mesh, not just at the boundaries. It will occur in problems with simply supported or free boundaries as well. While inappropriately strong boundary conditions can cause local problems, they are not the fundamental cause of shear locking. The cure requires a modification of the element stiffness itself, not just a change in boundary conditions.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2650142"}]}
