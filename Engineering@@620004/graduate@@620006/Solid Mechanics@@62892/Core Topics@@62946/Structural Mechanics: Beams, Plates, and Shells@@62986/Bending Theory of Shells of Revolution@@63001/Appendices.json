The membrane force resultants, which represent force per unit length of the midsurface, are related to the corresponding membrane stresses by integrating through the shell's constant thickness, $t$. For the meridional and circumferential directions, these relations are:\n$$N_s = \\sigma_s t$$\n$$N_{\\theta} = \\sigma_{\\theta} t$$\nwhere $\\sigma_s$ is the meridional stress and $\\sigma_{\\theta}$ is the circumferential (hoop) stress.\n\nThe material is stated to be homogeneous, isotropic, and linear elastic.

The circumference of the base is $C = 2\\pi r$. A change in radius, corresponding to a radial displacement $u_r$, would lead to a change in circumference $\\Delta C = 2\\pi u_r$.

The loading is a uniform temperature rise $\\Delta T$.\n\nFirst, we establish the governing equations for an axisymmetric membrane shell of revolution. In the absence of any externally applied surface tractions or body forces, the equilibrium equations are fundamental.\n\n1.  **Equilibrium Equations:**\n    For a spherical shell element, the principal radii of curvature are equal, $R_1 = R_2 = R$. The two non-trivial equilibrium equations for an axisymmetric state with no external loads ($p_\\phi = p_\\theta = p_n = 0$) are:\n    -   Meridional equilibrium:\n        $$ \\frac{d}{d\\phi}(N_\\phi \\sin\\phi) - N_\\theta \\cos\\phi = 0 $$\n    -   Normal equilibrium:\n        $$ \\frac{N_\\phi}{R_1} + \\frac{N_\\theta}{R_2} = p_n \\implies \\frac{N_\\phi}{R} + \\frac{N_\\theta}{R} = 0 $$\n    The normal equilibrium equation immediately yields a crucial relationship between the two membrane force resultants:\n    $$ N_\\phi = -N_\\theta $$\n    This expresses the requirement that for a curved membrane with no normal pressure, the effects of the two principal stress resultants must cancel each other out in the normal direction. Substituting this into the meridional equilibrium equation gives:\n    $$ \\frac{d}{d\\phi}(N_\\phi \\sin\\phi) - (-N_\\phi) \\cos\\phi = 0 $$\n    $$ \\frac{d N_\\phi}{d\\phi}\\sin\\phi + N_\\phi \\cos\\phi + N_\\phi \\cos\\phi = 0 $$\n    $$ \\sin\\phi \\frac{d N_\\phi}{d\\phi} + 2N_\\phi \\cos\\phi = 0 $$\n    This is a separable first-order ordinary differential equation for $N_\\phi(\\phi)$:\n    $$ \\frac{dN_\\phi}{N_\\phi} = -2\\frac{\\cos\\phi}{\\sin\\phi}d\\phi = -2\\cot\\phi \\, d\\phi $$\n    Integrating both sides yields:\n    $$ \\ln(N_\\phi) = -2\\ln(\\sin\\phi) + C_1 \\implies N_\\phi(\\phi) = \\frac{C}{\\sin^2\\phi} $$\n    where $C$ is a constant of integration. Consequently, $N_\\theta(\\phi) = -C/\\sin^2\\phi$.\n\n2.  **Regularity Condition at the Pole:**\n    The problem describes a spherical segment bounded by $\\phi = \\phi_0$, which implies it is a cap that includes the pole at $\\phi = 0$. For the physical solution to be valid, the stress resultants must remain finite everywhere within the shell, including at the pole. As $\\phi \\to 0$, the term $\\sin^2\\phi \\to 0$. To prevent $N_\\phi$ and $N_\\theta$ from becoming singular at the pole, the constant of integration $C$ must be zero.\n    $$ C=0 $$\n    Therefore, the only membrane solution that is both regular at the pole and satisfies the equilibrium equations for a spherical shell under no external load is the trivial solution:\n    $$ N_\\phi(\\phi) = 0 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad N_\\theta(\\phi) = 0 $$\n\n3.  **Kinematics, Constitutive Law, and Boundary Conditions:**\n    Let us now analyze the implications of this zero-stress state in the context of the thermal loading and boundary conditions. The linear thermoelastic constitutive relations for the membrane forces are:\n    $$ N_\\phi = \\frac{Et}{1-\\nu^2} [\\epsilon_\\phi + \\nu \\epsilon_\\theta - (1+\\nu)\\alpha\\Delta T] $$\n    $$ N_\\theta = \\frac{Et}{1-\\nu^2} [\\epsilon_\\theta + \\nu \\epsilon_\\phi - (1+\\nu)\\alpha\\Delta T] $$\n    where $\\epsilon_\\phi$ and $\\epsilon_\\theta$ are the total strains. If $N_\\phi = N_\\theta = 0$, we can solve for the strains:\n    $$ \\epsilon_\\phi + \\nu \\epsilon_\\theta = (1+\\nu)\\alpha\\Delta T $$\n    $$ \\epsilon_\\theta + \\nu \\epsilon_\\phi = (1+\\nu)\\alpha\\Delta T $$\n    Solving this system yields $\\epsilon_\\phi(1-\\nu^2) = (1+\\nu)\\alpha\\Delta T(1-\\nu)$, which simplifies to $\\epsilon_\\phi = \\alpha\\Delta T$. Similarly, $\\epsilon_\\theta = \\alpha\\Delta T$.\n    So, the zero-stress membrane state corresponds to a state of uniform strain equal to the free thermal strain:\n    $$ \\epsilon_\\phi = \\epsilon_\\theta = \\alpha\\Delta T $$\n    This is the state of free, unconstrained thermal expansion of the sphere.\n\n    The problem imposes a kinematic constraint at the edge $\\phi = \\phi_0$: \"the in-plane displacement along the edge is constrained so that the edge length does not increase\". This is a condition on the total circumferential strain at the edge, requiring it to be non-positive. For a temperature rise $\\Delta T > 0$, the free expansion would increase the edge length. The constraint means the total circumferential strain at the edge must be zero, $\\epsilon_\\theta(\\phi_0) = 0$.\n    The membrane solution yields $\\epsilon_\\theta(\\phi_0) = \\alpha\\Delta T$. This is in direct conflict with the boundary condition $\\epsilon_\\theta(\\phi_0)=0$ (assuming $\\alpha\\Delta T \\neq 0$).\n\n4.  **Interior Solution and Bending Effects:**\n    This incompatibility demonstrates that a pure membrane stress state cannot satisfy the prescribed boundary condition. In a physical shell with finite bending stiffness (which membrane theory neglects), the kinematic constraint at the edge would be enforced by a combination of membrane forces and bending moments localized near the edge. These edge effects create a \"boundary layer\" where the stress state is complex and involves bending.\n    \n    However, according to Saint-Venant's principle applied to shells, the influence of such self-equilibrating edge loads decays rapidly with distance from the boundary. The stress state in the \"interior\" of the shell, away from this boundary layer, is unaffected by the edge constraint and is correctly described by the pure membrane solution.\n    \n    The question asks for the \"spatially uniform interior membrane stress resultant $N^{\\star}$\". The membrane solution we derived, $N_\\phi = N_\\theta = 0$, is indeed spatially uniform and represents the state in the interior. A nonzero membrane stress field, such as a uniform state $N_\\phi=N_\\theta=N^{\\star} \\neq 0$, would satisfy meridional equilibrium but would violate the fundamental normal equilibrium equation $2N^{\\star}/R=0$, implying the existence of a fictitious normal pressure $p_n=2N^{\\star}/R$ that is not present. Such a solution is inconsistent with the first principles of membrane theory for a surface free of normal traction.\n\n    Therefore, the only valid conclusion under the strict application of membrane theory is that the thermal load induces no membrane stresses in the interior of the shell. The entire effect of the edge constraint is accommodated by a bending-dominated boundary layer, which is outside the scope of membrane theory.
