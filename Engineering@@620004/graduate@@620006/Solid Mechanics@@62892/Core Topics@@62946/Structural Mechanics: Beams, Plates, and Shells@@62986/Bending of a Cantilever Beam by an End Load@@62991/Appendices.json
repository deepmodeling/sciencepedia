It is a well-posed, scientifically grounded problem from the field of solid mechanics. All necessary data and definitions are provided, and there are no internal contradictions or ambiguities. The problem requires the derivation of the internal bending moment in a cantilever beam using fundamental principles of static equilibrium.\n\nThe derivation proceeds as follows. We will analyze a free-body diagram of a portion of the beam and apply the equilibrium equations.\n\nThe problem specifies the analysis of the free body of the segment to the right of a cut at an arbitrary position $x=a$, where $0 \\le a \\le L$. This segment spans from $x=a$ to the free end at $x=L$.\n\nThe forces and moments acting on this free-body segment are:\n$1$. The external point load of magnitude $P$ applied at the free end, $x=L$. This force acts in the negative $y$-direction (downwards).\n$2$. The internal actions at the cut face at $x=a$. These are the effects of the left portion of the beam (from $x=0$ to $x=a$) on the right portion. These actions consist of an internal shear force, which we denote as $V(a)$, and an internal bending moment, $M(a)$.\n\nThe problem requires a specific sign convention for the bending moment $M(a)$: a positive value of $M(a)$ must correspond to a hogging action, which means the top fibers of the beam are in tension. For a horizontal beam, this corresponds to the beam being bent into a shape that is concave down. Let us analyze the direction of the moment vector $M(a)$ on our chosen free body (the right segment). A hogging moment is one that would cause tension in the top fibers of the material to the left of the cut. This requires a clockwise moment couple to be acting on the face of the left segment at $x=a$. By Newton's third law, the moment exerted by the left segment on the right segment must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction. Therefore, the internal moment $M(a)$ on the free-body diagram of the right segment is a counter-clockwise moment.\n\nThe problem further states that for the purpose of writing equilibrium equations, counter-clockwise moments are to be taken as positive. This is consistent with our finding; a physically positive (hogging) moment $M(a)$ corresponds to a mathematically positive (counter-clockwise) term in the equilibrium equation.\n\nWe now apply the condition of static rotational equilibrium to the free-body segment. The sum of moments about any point must be zero. We choose to sum the moments about the point located at the cut, $(x=a, y=0)$. This choice is strategic as the internal shear force $V(a)$ passes through this point, and thus its moment is zero, simplifying the equation.\n\nThe rotational equilibrium equation is:\n$$ \\sum M_{\\text{at } x=a} = 0 $$\n\nThe moments acting on the segment are:\n$1$. The internal bending moment $M(a)$ at the cut. According to our sign convention, we consider it positive, so it contributes $+M(a)$ to the sum.\n$2$. The moment produced by the external load $P$. The force $P$ acts at $x=L$. The lever arm of this force with respect to the point $x=a$ is the distance $(L-a)$. Since the force $P$ is directed downwards, it creates a clockwise moment about $x=a$. In a system where counter-clockwise is positive, this moment is negative. Its value is $-P(L-a)$.\n\nSubstituting these terms into the equilibrium equation gives:\n$$ M(a) - P(L-a) = 0 $$\n\nSolving for the internal bending moment $M(a)$, we obtain the expression:\n$$ M(a) = P(L-a) $$\n\nThis is the closed-form expression for the internal bending moment at any section $x=a$ along the cantilever beam. It is expressed in terms of the given parameters $P$, $L$, and $a$. The units are Newton-meters, as required, since $P$ is in Newtons and $(L-a)$ is in meters. The expression correctly shows that the moment is maximum at the fixed support ($a=0$), where $M(0) = PL$, and zero at the free end ($a=L$), where $M(L) = 0$. Since $P>0$ and $L \\ge a$, the value of $M(a)$ is non-negative, which is consistent with the physical expectation that a downward end load on a cantilever beam produces a hogging moment throughout its length.", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{P(L-a)} $$", "id": "2617201"}, {"introduction": "With the internal moment distribution known, we can now predict the beam's deformed shape using the Euler-Bernoulli hypothesis, which relates moment to curvature.

Its derivative, the slope $\\theta(x)$, is a quadratic function, and its second derivative, the curvature $\\kappa(x)$, is a linear function of $x$. The curvature is proportional to the moment, which decreases linearly from a maximum at the clamped support ($x=0$) to zero at the free end ($x=L$). Consequently, the rate of change of the slope is greatest near the support and diminishes towards the tip. This means the slope accumulates most rapidly in the region nearest the support.

It is a standard, well-posed problem in structural mechanics. A solution will be derived.\n\n### Derivation of Internal Torsional Moment\nTo determine the internal torsional moment $T(z)$ for a cross-section at an arbitrary location $z \\in (0, L)$, we apply the principles of statics to a free-body diagram of the beam segment from $z$ to $L$.\n\nThe external load is the force $\\mathbf{P} = P\\,\\hat{\\mathbf{e}}_2$ applied at the free end $z=L$. The shear center $\\mathcal{S}$ at any cross-section has coordinates $(s_1, s_2)$ relative to the centroid $\\mathcal{C}$ in the $(\\hat{\\mathbf{e}}_1, \\hat{\\mathbf{e}}_2)$ plane. The problem specifies that the load's line of action has an offset $a_1$ along $\\hat{\\mathbf{e}}_1$ from the plane containing the shear-center line and parallel to $\\hat{\\mathbf{e}}_2$. The plane containing the shear center line and parallel to $\\hat{\\mathbf{e}}_2$ is the plane $x_1 = s_1$. Thus, the line of action of the force $\\mathbf{P}$ is at $x_1 = s_1+a_1$.\n\nThe internal torsional moment $T(z)$ is, by definition, the component of the internal moment vector along the longitudinal axis of the beam. For uncoupled bending and torsion, this moment is taken about the axis formed by the locus of the shear centers.\n\nLet us compute the sum of moments about the shear center axis for the segment $[z, L]$. The only external force on this segment is $\\mathbf{P}$ at $z=L$. The position vector of the point of application of the load, relative to the shear center at the same cross-section ($z=L$), has a component in the $\\hat{\\mathbf{e}}_1$ direction equal to $a_1$. Let this relative position vector in the cross-sectional plane be $\\mathbf{r}_{\\text{offset}} = a_1 \\hat{\\mathbf{e}}_1$. The force is $\\mathbf{P} = P \\hat{\\mathbf{e}}_2$.\n\nThe external torque applied at the end $z=L$ about the shear center axis is:\n$$ \\mathbf{T}_{\\text{app}} = \\mathbf{r}_{\\text{offset}} \\times \\mathbf{P} = (a_1 \\hat{\\mathbf{e}}_1) \\times (P \\hat{\\mathbf{e}}_2) = P a_1 (\\hat{\\mathbf{e}}_1 \\times \\hat{\\mathbf{e}}_2) = P a_1 \\hat{\\mathbf{e}}_3 $$\nFor the segment $[z, L]$ to be in static equilibrium, the internal torsional moment at the cut face at $z$ must balance the total external torque applied to the segment. Let the internal torsional moment be $T(z)$. Following the standard convention where the internal resultant at a cut is the static equivalent of the external forces on the remaining segment, the internal torsional moment vector is $\\mathbf{T}(z) = T(z)\\hat{\\mathbf{e}}_3$.\n$$ \\mathbf{T}(z) + \\sum \\mathbf{M}_{\\text{ext forces about S-axis}} = 0 $$\nThis is a common source of confusion in sign conventions. A more direct approach is to state that the internal moment $T(z)\\hat{\\mathbf{e}}_3$ is that which is exerted *by* the material at $z^-$ *onto* the material at $z^+$. On the free body from $z$ to $L$, there acts an internal moment $-T(z)\\hat{\\mathbf{e}}_3$ at the cut surface. Thus, for equilibrium of moments about the shear center axis:\n$$ -T(z)\\hat{\\mathbf{e}}_3 + \\mathbf{T}_{\\text{app}} = \\mathbf{0} $$\n$$ T(z)\\hat{\\mathbf{e}}_3 = \\mathbf{T}_{\\text{app}} = P a_1 \\hat{\\mathbf{e}}_3 $$\nTherefore, the internal torsional moment is:\n$$ T(z) = P a_1 $$\nThis result is independent of $z$, so the internal torsional moment is constant along the beam span, for $z \\in (0, L)$.\n\nFrom this result, the condition for the internal torsional moment to vanish, $T(z)=0$, is $P a_1 = 0$. Assuming a non-trivial load $P \\neq 0$, the condition is $a_1=0$. This means the perpendicular offset of the load's line of action from the shear center must be zero. In other words, the line of action of the transverse force must pass through the shear center $\\mathcal{S}$. This is consistent with the definition of the shear center provided in the problem statement.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. The internal torsional moment $T(z)$ vanishes for all $z\\in(0,L)$ if and only if the line of action of the transverse load passes through the shear center $\\mathcal{S}$ and lies in a principal bending plane. If the load plane is offset from $\\mathcal{S}$ by $a_1$ along $\\hat{\\mathbf{e}}_1$, then, by moment equilibrium about $\\hat{\\mathbf{e}}_3$, $T(z)\\equiv \\big[(\\mathbf{r}_\\mathcal{L}-\\mathbf{r}_\\mathcal{S})\\times \\mathbf{P}\\big]\\cdot \\hat{\\mathbf{e}}_3=P\\,a_1$ for $0<z<L$ (constant in $z$, with sign set by the right-hand rule).**\n\n-   **Analysis**: The first part of the statement provides a condition for zero torsion: \"if and only if the line of action... passes through the shear center $\\mathcal{S}$ and lies in a principal bending plane\". The condition that the load must pass through $\\mathcal{S}$ is correct. The additional condition \"and lies in a principal bending plane\" is problematic. For the given load $\\mathbf{P}=P\\hat{\\mathbf{e}}_2$, its line of action lies in the principal plane $(\\mathcal{C}, \\hat{\\mathbf{e}}_2, \\hat{\\mathbf{e}}_3)$ only if its $x_1$ coordinate is $0$. This is not a general requirement for zero torsion. Torsion is zero solely if the load passes through $\\mathcal{S}$, regardless of whether $\\mathcal{S}$ is on a principal plane through the centroid. However, the second part of the statement is a perfectly correct derivation of the torsional moment from statics. It correctly calculates the torque as the cross product of the lever arm from the shear center and the force, yielding $T(z) = P a_1$. It also correctly states that this torque is constant for $0<z<L$. Among the given options, this one contains the most accurate physical reasoning and the correct mathematical result. The flaw in the first clause is likely a result of imprecise language, but the core physical principle (passing through $\\mathcal{S}$) and the subsequent quantitative analysis are correct.\n-   **Verdict**: **Correct**. Despite the imprecise phrasing in the first clause, this is the only option that presents the correct physical mechanism and mathematical formula derived from statics.\n\n**B. The internal torsional moment $T(z)$ vanishes whenever the load is applied in any principal bending plane, irrespective of whether its line of action passes through $\\mathcal{S}$. If the load plane is offset from $\\mathcal{S}$ by $a_1$, then $T(z)$ grows linearly from $0$ at $z=L$ to $P\\,a_1$ at $z=0$, i.e., $T(z)=P\\,a_1\\,(1-z/L)$.**\n\n-   **Analysis**: The first statement is false. If the load is applied in a principal plane (e.g., through the centroid) and the shear center is not in that plane, a torsional moment will be generated. The claim ignores the fundamental role of the shear center. The second part is also false. The internal torsional moment resulting from a concentrated end torque is constant along the beam, not linearly varying. A linear distribution of moment, $M(z) \\propto (L-z)$, is characteristic of the *bending moment* from a concentrated end force, not the torsional moment.\n-   **Verdict**: **Incorrect**.\n\n**C. The internal torsional moment $T(z)$ vanishes if and only if the line of action passes through the centroid $\\mathcal{C}$. If the load plane is offset by $a_1$, then Saint-Venant torsion gives $T(z)\\equiv G\\,J\\,a_1$ for $0<z<L$, where $G$ is the shear modulus and $J$ is the torsional constant.**\n\n-   **Analysis**: The first statement is false. The special point for avoiding torsion is the shear center $\\mathcal{S}$, not the centroid $\\mathcal{C}$, unless they coincide. The second part is also fundamentally flawed. It confuses the static equilibrium equation for torque ($T=Pa_1$) with the material's constitutive response to torque ($T = GJ \\frac{d\\phi}{dz}$, where $\\frac{d\\phi}{dz}$ is the rate of twist). The formula provided, $T=GJa_1$, is dimensionally and conceptually incorrect.\n-   **Verdict**: **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. The internal torsional moment $T(z)$ vanishes only if $\\mathcal{S}$ coincides with $\\mathcal{C}$ (i.e., $s_1=0$ and $s_2=0$). Otherwise, any transverse load produces torsion, even when applied through $\\mathcal{S}$. For a load plane offset by $a_1$, $T(z)\\equiv P\\,\\sqrt{s_1^2+s_2^2}$ for $0<z<L$, independent of $a_1$.**\n\n-   **Analysis**: This statement is entirely incorrect. The condition for zero torsion is that the load passes through $\\mathcal{S}$; it does not require $\\mathcal{S}$ and $\\mathcal{C}$ to coincide. The claim that any transverse load produces torsion even when applied through $\\mathcal{S}$ contradicts the very definition of the shear center. The formula for $T(z)$ is nonsensical, as it makes the torque independent of the load's offset $a_1$ and instead dependent on the distance between the centroid and shear center.\n-   **Verdict**: **Incorrect**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2617211"}]}
