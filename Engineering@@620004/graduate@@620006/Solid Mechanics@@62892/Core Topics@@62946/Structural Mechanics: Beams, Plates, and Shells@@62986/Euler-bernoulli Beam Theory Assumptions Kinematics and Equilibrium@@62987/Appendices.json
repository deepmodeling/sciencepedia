Assume the Euler–Bernoulli (classical) beam hypotheses: plane cross-sections remain plane and normal to the deflected centerline, and transverse normals do not experience stretching. Let the geometric centroid of each cross-section coincide with the neutral axis.\n\nThree alternative cross-sections are considered, each bending about its strong (symmetric) centroidal axis in response to the same loading:\n- Rectangular section with width $b$ and height $h$.\n- Circular section with diameter $d$.\n- Doubly symmetric I-section with overall height $h_{I}$, flange width $b_{f}$, flange thickness $t_{f}$, and web thickness $t_{w}$, where $0<t_{f}<\\tfrac{1}{2}h_{I}$ and $0<t_{w}<b_{f}$.\n\nTasks:\n1) Starting only from the stated kinematic assumptions, linear elasticity, and force/moment equilibrium of a differential beam element, derive how the normal stress distribution across a cross-section depends on the bending moment and the second moment of area.

It is scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and contains all necessary information for derivation. No flaws are identified. We proceed with the solution.\n\nThe analysis is structured into the three main tasks presented in the problem statement. We use a coordinate system where $x$ is the longitudinal axis of the beam, $y$ is the transverse coordinate in the plane of bending, measured positive upwards from the neutral axis, and $z$ is the coordinate along the width of the cross-section.\n\n1) Normal Stress Distribution, Bending Moment, and Scaling\n\nThe derivation begins from the kinematic assumption of Euler-Bernoulli beam theory: plane cross-sections, initially normal to the beam's longitudinal axis, remain plane and normal to the deflected neutral axis. Let $w(x)$ be the transverse deflection of the neutral axis. For small deflections, the rotation of a cross-section at position $x$ is given by the angle $\\theta(x) \\approx \\frac{dw}{dx}$.\n\nA point at a vertical distance $y$ from the neutral axis experiences a longitudinal displacement $u_x$ due to this rotation. This displacement is given by $u_x(x,y) = -y \\theta(x) = -y \\frac{dw}{dx}$. The negative sign indicates that for a positive rotation (counter-clockwise) and positive $y$ (above the neutral axis), the displacement is in the negative $x$-direction, resulting in compression.\n\nThe longitudinal normal strain $\\varepsilon_{xx}$ is the rate of change of this displacement with respect to $x$:\n$$\n\\varepsilon_{xx}(x,y) = \\frac{\\partial u_x}{\\partial x} = -y \\frac{d^2w}{dx^2}\n$$\nThe quantity $\\kappa(x) = \\frac{d^2w}{dx^2}$ is the curvature of the neutral axis. Thus, the strain distribution is linear across the cross-section:\n$$\n\\varepsilon_{xx}(x,y) = -y \\kappa(x)\n$$\nAssuming the beam material is homogeneous and linearly elastic, it obeys Hooke's Law. The longitudinal normal stress $\\sigma_{xx}$ is related to the strain by the Young's modulus $E$:\n$$\n\\sigma_{xx}(x,y) = E \\varepsilon_{xx}(x,y) = -E \\kappa(x) y\n$$\nThis shows the stress is also distributed linearly across the section height.\n\nThe net axial force on the cross-section must be zero, as the beam is subjected only to transverse loading. The position of the neutral axis is defined by this condition.\n$$\nF_x = \\int_A \\sigma_{xx} dA = \\int_A (-E \\kappa y) dA = -E \\kappa \\int_A y dA = 0\n$$\nSince for a bent beam $E \\neq 0$ and $\\kappa \\neq 0$, it must be that $\\int_A y dA = 0$. This integral is the first moment of area. The condition that it is zero confirms that the origin of the $y$-axis, the neutral axis, must pass through the centroid of the cross-section. The problem statement gives this as a premise.\n\nThe bending moment $M(x)$ at a cross-section is the resultant moment of the normal stresses about the neutral axis (the $z$-axis). With a sign convention where a positive moment induces positive curvature (tension on the bottom, compression on top), we have:\n$$\nM(x) = - \\int_A y \\sigma_{xx} dA\n$$\nSubstituting the expression for $\\sigma_{xx}$:\n$$\nM(x) = - \\int_A y (-E \\kappa y) dA = E \\kappa \\int_A y^2 dA\n$$\nThe integral $\\int_A y^2 dA$ is the second moment of area of the cross-section about the neutral axis, denoted by $I$.\n$$\nI = \\int_A y^2 dA\n$$\nThus, the relationship between bending moment and curvature is $M(x) = E I \\kappa(x)$.\n\nTo find the stress distribution in terms of the bending moment, we substitute $\\kappa = \\frac{M}{EI}$ back into the stress equation:\n$$\n\\sigma_{xx}(x,y) = -E \\left(\\frac{M}{EI}\\right) y = -\\frac{M(x) y}{I}\n$$\nThis is the well-known flexure formula. The maximum magnitude of the normal stress, the extreme-fiber stress $\\sigma_{max}$, occurs at the point farthest from the neutral axis, where $|y|$ is maximum. Let this distance be $c = y_{max}$.\n$$\n\\sigma_{max} = \\frac{M c}{I}\n$$\nFor a fixed bending moment $M$, the extreme-fiber stress $\\sigma_{max}$ is inversely proportional to the second moment of area $I$, i.e., $\\sigma_{max} \\propto \\frac{1}{I}$. It is directly proportional to the distance $c$ from the neutral axis. The section depth, let's call it $h_{depth}$, is related to $c$ (for symmetric sections, $c = h_{depth}/2$). Therefore, the extreme-fiber stress scales with the ratio of section depth to the second moment of area, $\\sigma_{max} \\propto \\frac{c}{I}$.\n\n2) Governing Differential Equation for Deflection\n\nFrom the previous derivation, the moment-curvature relation is $M(x) = E I \\frac{d^2w}{dx^2}$. For a prismatic beam, the flexural rigidity $EI$ is constant.\n\nNext, we consider the equilibrium of a differential element of the beam of length $dx$. Let the distributed transverse load be $q(x)$ (positive upwards) and the internal shear force be $V(x)$. Summing forces in the vertical direction gives $\\frac{dV}{dx} = q(x)$. Summing moments gives $\\frac{dM}{dx} = V(x)$. Combining these, we obtain the relation between the bending moment and the applied load:\n$$\n\\frac{d^2M}{dx^2} = q(x)\n$$\nSubstituting the moment-curvature relationship into this equilibrium equation yields the governing differential equation for the transverse deflection $w(x)$:\n$$\n\\frac{d^2}{dx^2}\\left(E I \\frac{d^2w}{dx^2}\\right) = q(x)\n$$\nSince $E$ and $I$ are constant, this simplifies to:\n$$\nE I \\frac{d^4w}{dx^4} = q(x)\n$$\nFor a simply supported beam of length $L$ under a uniform load $q(x)=q$, where $q$ is a constant, we must solve this equation with boundary conditions $w(0)=0$, $w(L)=0$, $M(0)=0$, and $M(L)=0$. Since $M = EIw''$, the moment conditions are $w''(0)=0$ and $w''(L)=0$. Assuming the load $q$ acts downwards, we set the right-hand side to $-q$ if $w$ is positive upwards.\n$$\nE I \\frac{d^4w}{dx^4} = -q\n$$\nIntegrating four times and applying the boundary conditions yields the deflection curve:\n$$\nw(x) = -\\frac{q}{24EI} (x^4 - 2Lx^3 + L^3x)\n$$\nThe midspan deflection occurs at $x=L/2$:\n$$\nw\\left(\\frac{L}{2}\\right) = -\\frac{q}{24EI} \\left(\\left(\\frac{L}{2}\\right)^4 - 2L\\left(\\frac{L}{2}\\right)^3 + L^3\\left(\\frac{L}{2}\\right)\\right) = -\\frac{5qL^4}{384EI}\n$$\nThe magnitude of the midspan deflection is $|w_{mid}| = \\frac{5qL^4}{384EI}$. This explicitly shows that the deflection is inversely proportional to the Young's modulus $E$ and inversely proportional to the second moment of area $I$.\n\n3) Calculation of Second Moments of Area\n\nWe compute the centroidal second moment of area $I$ about the strong axis from first principles for each specified cross-section.\n\n- **Rectangular section:** Width $b$, height $h$. The centroid is at the geometric center. We integrate over the area by taking horizontal strips of width $b$ and infinitesimal height $dy$.\n$$\nI_{rect} = \\int_A y^2 dA = \\int_{-h/2}^{h/2} y^2 (b \\, dy) = b \\left[ \\frac{y^3}{3} \\right]_{-h/2}^{h/2} = \\frac{b}{3} \\left( \\frac{h^3}{8} - \\left(-\\frac{h^3}{8}\\right) \\right) = \\frac{bh^3}{12}\n$$\n\n- **Circular section:** Diameter $d$, radius $R=d/2$. It is convenient to use polar coordinates $(r, \\theta)$ where $y = r \\sin\\theta$ and $dA = r dr d\\theta$.\n$$\nI_{circ} = \\int_A y^2 dA = \\int_0^{2\\pi} \\int_0^R (r \\sin\\theta)^2 (r dr d\\theta) = \\left(\\int_0^R r^3 dr\\right) \\left(\\int_0^{2\\pi} \\sin^2\\theta d\\theta\\right)\n$$\nThe integrals evaluate to:\n$$\n\\int_0^R r^3 dr = \\frac{R^4}{4}\n\\qquad\n\\int_0^{2\\pi} \\sin^2\\theta d\\theta = \\int_0^{2\\pi} \\frac{1-\\cos(2\\theta)}{2} d\\theta = \\pi\n$$\nSo, $I_{circ} = \\frac{\\pi R^4}{4}$. In terms of diameter $d$, this is:\n$$\nI_{circ} = \\frac{\\pi (d/2)^4}{4} = \\frac{\\pi d^4}{64}\n$$\n\n- **Doubly symmetric I-section:** Height $h_I$, flange width $b_f$, flange thickness $t_f$, web thickness $t_w$. We treat the section as an assembly of a central web and two flanges and use superposition along with the parallel-axis theorem, $I = I_c + A d^2$, where $I_c$ is the second moment of area about the part's own centroidal axis, $A$ is the area of the part, and $d$ is the distance between the part's centroidal axis and the global centroidal axis.\n\nThe web is a rectangle of width $t_w$ and height $h_w = h_I - 2t_f$. Its centroid coincides with the global centroid of the I-section, so the parallel-axis theorem is not needed for the web.\n$$\nI_{web} = \\frac{t_w h_w^3}{12} = \\frac{t_w (h_I - 2t_f)^3}{12}\n$$\nEach flange is a rectangle of width $b_f$ and height $t_f$. The second moment of area of one flange about its own centroidal axis is $I_{flange, c} = \\frac{b_f t_f^3}{12}$. The centroid of each flange is at a distance $d = \\frac{h_I}{2} - \\frac{t_f}{2} = \\frac{h_I - t_f}{2}$ from the global centroidal axis. The area of a flange is $A_f = b_f t_f$.\nBy the parallel-axis theorem, the second moment of area for one flange about the global axis is:\n$$\nI_{one\\_flange} = I_{flange, c} + A_f d^2 = \\frac{b_f t_f^3}{12} + (b_f t_f)\\left(\\frac{h_I - t_f}{2}\\right)^2\n$$\nThe total second moment of area for the I-section is the sum of the contributions from the web and the two flanges:\n$$\nI_{I-section} = I_{web} + 2 \\cdot I_{one\\_flange} = \\frac{t_w (h_I - 2t_f)^3}{12} + 2 \\left[ \\frac{b_f t_f^3}{12} + b_f t_f \\frac{(h_I - t_f)^2}{4} \\right]\n$$\n$$\nI_{I-section} = \\frac{t_w (h_I - 2t_f)^3}{12} + \\frac{b_f t_f^3}{6} + \\frac{b_f t_f (h_I-t_f)^2}{2}\n$$\nThis expression can be simplified for the final answer. An alternative method is to subtract the two void rectangular areas from a large bounding rectangle of width $b_f$ and height $h_I$. The void areas have width $\\frac{b_f-t_w}{2}$ each and height $h_I - 2t_f$. Their centroids are on the main neutral axis.\n$$\nI_{I-section} = I_{total\\_rect} - 2 \\cdot I_{void\\_rect} = \\frac{b_f h_I^3}{12} - 2 \\cdot \\frac{\\left(\\frac{b_f - t_w}{2}\\right) (h_I - 2t_f)^3}{12}\n$$\nThis simplifies to the final expression reported below.\n\n4) Final Expression for the I-section\n\nThe fully simplified, closed-form expression for the centroidal second moment of area of the I-section is:\n$$\nI_{I-section} = \\frac{1}{12} \\left[ b_f h_I^3 - (b_f - t_w)(h_I - 2t_f)^3 \\right]\n$$\nThis expression is provided as the final answer.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{1}{12} \\left( b_{f} h_{I}^{3} - (b_{f} - t_{w})(h_{I} - 2t_{f})^{3} \\right)}$$", "id": "2637250"}, {"introduction": "With the foundational theory in place, this next exercise provides a hands-on application to a classic structural problem.

Do not include any intermediate results in the final answer.", "solution": "The problem as stated is well-posed, scientifically grounded, and contains sufficient information for a unique solution within the framework of Euler-Bernoulli beam theory. We shall proceed directly to the solution.\n\nFirst, we derive the one-dimensional differential equilibrium relations for a beam element. Consider an infinitesimal segment of the beam of length $dx$, located at a coordinate $x$. Let the downward distributed load be $q(x)$. We adopt the sign convention where the shear force $V$ is positive upwards on a positive face, and the bending moment $M$ is positive when it causes compression in the top fibers (counter-clockwise on a positive face). The free-body diagram of the segment from $x$ to $x+dx$ is subject to shear forces $V(x)$ and $V(x+dx)$, bending moments $M(x)$ and $M(x+dx)$, and the external distributed load $q(x)$.\n\nEquilibrium of vertical forces ($\\sum F_y = 0$, with upward as positive) yields:\n$$V(x) - (V(x) + dV) - q(x)dx = 0$$\nwhere $V(x+dx)$ is expanded as $V(x)+dV$. This simplifies to:\n$$-dV - q(x)dx = 0 \\implies \\frac{dV}{dx} = -q(x)$$\n\nEquilibrium of moments about the point at $x+dx$ ($\\sum M_{x+dx} = 0$, with counter-clockwise as positive) yields:\n$$-M(x) + (M(x)+dM) - V(x)dx + q(x)dx \\left(\\frac{dx}{2}\\right) = 0$$\nwhere $M(x+dx)$ is expanded as $M(x)+dM$. Neglecting the higher-order term $q(x)(dx)^2/2$, this simplifies to:\n$$dM - V(x)dx = 0 \\implies \\frac{dM}{dx} = V(x)$$\nThese are the required one-dimensional differential equilibrium relations. Combining them, we obtain the second-order relation $\\frac{d^2M}{dx^2} = \\frac{dV}{dx} = -q(x)$.\n\nNext, we determine the support reactions. The beam is simply supported, with a pin at $x=0$ and a roller at $x=L$. Let the vertical reactions be $R_A$ at $x=0$ and $R_B$ at $x=L$. The total downward force from the distributed load $q(x) = q_1 x$ is:\n$$F_{total} = \\int_0^L q(x) dx = \\int_0^L q_1 x \\, dx = q_1 \\left[\\frac{x^2}{2}\\right]_0^L = \\frac{q_1 L^2}{2}$$\nGlobal vertical force equilibrium requires $R_A + R_B = F_{total} = \\frac{q_1 L^2}{2}$.\nGlobal moment equilibrium about the pin at $x=0$ requires the sum of moments to be zero:\n$$\\sum M_A = R_B L - \\int_0^L x \\, q(x) dx = 0$$\n$$R_B L = \\int_0^L x(q_1 x) dx = q_1 \\int_0^L x^2 dx = q_1 \\left[\\frac{x^3}{3}\\right]_0^L = \\frac{q_1 L^3}{3}$$\nSolving for $R_B$ gives $R_B = \\frac{q_1 L^2}{3}$.\nSubstituting this into the force equilibrium equation gives $R_A = \\frac{q_1 L^2}{2} - R_B = \\frac{q_1 L^2}{2} - \\frac{q_1 L^2}{3} = \\frac{q_1 L^2}{6}$.\n\nNow we integrate the equilibrium relations to find $V(x)$ and $M(x)$.\nFrom $\\frac{dV}{dx} = -q(x) = -q_1 x$, we integrate to get:\n$$V(x) = \\int -q_1 x \\, dx = -\\frac{q_1 x^2}{2} + C_1$$\nThe constant $C_1$ is found from the boundary condition at $x=0$. The shear force just inside the support is equal to the reaction force, so $V(0) = R_A$.\n$$V(0) = -\\frac{q_1 (0)^2}{2} + C_1 = \\frac{q_1 L^2}{6} \\implies C_1 = \\frac{q_1 L^2}{6}$$\nThus, the shear force is $V(x) = \\frac{q_1 L^2}{6} - \\frac{q_1 x^2}{2}$.\n\nFrom $\\frac{dM}{dx} = V(x)$, we integrate to find the bending moment:\n$$M(x) = \\int \\left(\\frac{q_1 L^2}{6} - \\frac{q_1 x^2}{2}\\right) dx = \\frac{q_1 L^2}{6}x - \\frac{q_1 x^3}{6} + C_2$$\nThe constant $C_2$ is found from the boundary condition for the moment.

For $V(x)$, the derivative is $\\frac{dV}{dx} = -q_1 x$. Since $q_1 > 0$, this derivative is zero only at $x=0$, which is not in the open interval $(0, L)$. Thus, there are no interior stationary points for the shear force.\nFor $M(x)$, a stationary point occurs where $\\frac{dM}{dx} = V(x) = 0$.\n$$\\frac{q_1 L^2}{6} - \\frac{q_1 x^2}{2} = 0 \\implies \\frac{q_1 x^2}{2} = \\frac{q_1 L^2}{6} \\implies x^2 = \\frac{L^2}{3}$$\nThe positive solution in the interval $(0, L)$ is $x = \\frac{L}{\\sqrt{3}}$.\nTo classify this point, we examine the second derivative: $\\frac{d^2M}{dx^2} = \\frac{dV}{dx} = -q_1 x$.\nAt $x=\\frac{L}{\\sqrt{3}}$, $\\frac{d^2M}{dx^2} = -q_1 \\frac{L}{\\sqrt{3}}  0$, which indicates that this stationary point is a local maximum.\n\nNext, we seek interior points of contraflexure, where $M(x)=0$ for $x \\in (0, L)$.\n$$M(x) = \\frac{q_1}{6}(L^2 x - x^3) = \\frac{q_1 x}{6}(L^2 - x^2) = \\frac{q_1 x}{6}(L-x)(L+x) = 0$$\nThe roots are $x=0$, $x=L$, and $x=-L$. None of these lie in the open interval $(0, L)$, so there are no interior points of contraflexure.\n\nFinally, we determine the location $x^{\\star}$ of the absolute maximum bending moment on the closed interval $[0, L]$. The candidates for the location of an absolute extremum are the endpoints and any interior critical points.\nThe moment at the endpoints is $M(0) = 0$ and $M(L) = 0$.\nThe moment at the one interior critical point $x=\\frac{L}{\\sqrt{3}}$ is:\n$$M\\left(\\frac{L}{\\sqrt{3}}\\right) = \\frac{q_1}{6}\\left(L^2\\frac{L}{\\sqrt{3}} - \\left(\\frac{L}{\\sqrt{3}}\\right)^3\\right) = \\frac{q_1}{6}\\left(\\frac{L^3}{\\sqrt{3}} - \\frac{L^3}{3\\sqrt{3}}\\right) = \\frac{q_1}{6}\\left(\\frac{2L^3}{3\\sqrt{3}}\\right) = \\frac{q_1 L^3}{9\\sqrt{3}}$$\nSince $q_1  0$ and $L  0$, this value is positive.

The governing differential equation is thus:\n$$\nEIw''(x) = M(x) = -P(L-x)\n$$\nTo find the slope, $w'(x)$, we integrate this equation with respect to $x$:\n$$\nEIw'(x) = \\int -P(L-x) \\, dx = -P \\left( Lx - \\frac{x^2}{2} \\right) + C_1\n$$\nThe integration constant $C_1$ is determined from the boundary condition at the clamped end ($x=0$), where the slope must be zero: $w'(0)=0$.\n$$\nEIw'(0) = -P(0-0) + C_1 = 0 \\implies C_1=0\n$$\nThe expression for the slope along the beam is therefore:\n$$\nw'(x) = -\\frac{P}{EI} \\left( Lx - \\frac{x^2}{2} \\right)\n$$\n\nThird, we analyze the modeling-error tolerance to establish a limit on the maximum allowable slope. The constraint is given by:\n$$\n\\frac{|\\kappa_{\\text{lin}}-\\kappa_{\\text{exact}}|}{|\\kappa_{\\text{lin}}|} \\le \\varepsilon\n$$\nSubstituting the expressions for the linearized and exact curvatures, $\\kappa_{\\text{lin}} = w''(x)$ and $\\kappa_{\\text{exact}} = \\frac{w''(x)}{(1+(w'(x))^2)^{3/2}}$, we have:\n$$\n\\frac{\\left| w''(x) - \\frac{w''(x)}{(1+(w'(x))^2)^{3/2}} \\right|}{|w''(x)|} \\le \\varepsilon\n$$\nFor a non-zero bending moment, $w''(x) \\neq 0$, allowing for cancellation:\n$$\n\\left| 1 - \\frac{1}{(1+(w'(x))^2)^{3/2}} \\right| \\le \\varepsilon\n$$\nSince $(w'(x))^2 \\ge 0$, the term $(1+(w'(x))^2)^{-3/2}$ is always less than or equal to $1$. The expression inside the absolute value is therefore non-negative, and the inequality becomes:\n$$\n1 - (1+(w'(x))^2)^{-3/2} \\le \\varepsilon\n$$\nRearranging to solve for $|w'(x)|$:\n$$\n1 - \\varepsilon \\le (1+(w'(x))^2)^{-3/2}\n$$\n$$\n(1-\\varepsilon)^{-1} \\ge (1+(w'(x))^2)^{3/2}\n$$\n$$\n(1-\\varepsilon)^{-2/3} \\ge 1+(w'(x))^2\n$$\n$$\n(w'(x))^2 \\le (1-\\varepsilon)^{-2/3} - 1\n$$\nThis leads to an upper bound on the magnitude of the slope at any point $x$:\n$$\n|w'(x)| \\le \\sqrt{(1-\\varepsilon)^{-2/3} - 1}\n$$\nThis condition must be satisfied everywhere along the beam, which means it must hold for the maximum absolute slope, $\\max_{x\\in[0,L]} |w'(x)|$.\n\nFourth, we determine the maximum load $P^{\\star}$. We must first find the location and value of the maximum absolute slope from our linear solution. The slope magnitude is:\n$$\n|w'(x)| = \\frac{P}{EI} \\left( Lx - \\frac{x^2}{2} \\right)\n$$\nTo find the maximum of this function on the interval $x \\in [0,L]$, we examine its derivative: $\\frac{d}{dx}|w'(x)| = \\frac{P}{EI}(L-x)$. This derivative is non-negative for all $x \\in [0,L]$, indicating that the slope magnitude is a monotonically increasing function of $x$. The maximum slope thus occurs at the free end, $x=L$.\n$$\n\\max_{x\\in[0,L]} |w'(x)| = |w'(L)| = \\frac{P}{EI} \\left( L^2 - \\frac{L^2}{2} \\right) = \\frac{PL^2}{2EI}\n$$\nThe critical load $P^{\\star}$ is the load for which this maximum slope equals the limit derived from the error tolerance:\n$$\n\\frac{P^{\\star}L^2}{2EI} = \\sqrt{(1-\\varepsilon)^{-2/3} - 1}\n$$\nSolving for $P^{\\star}$:\n$$\nP^{\\star} = \\frac{2EI}{L^2} \\sqrt{(1-\\varepsilon)^{-2/3} - 1}\n$$\nThe second moment of area, $I$, for the rectangular cross-section is $I = \\frac{bh^3}{12}$. Substituting this into the expression for $P^{\\star}$:\n$$\nP^{\\star} = \\frac{2E\\left(\\frac{bh^3}{12}\\right)}{L^2} \\sqrt{(1-\\varepsilon)^{-2/3} - 1} = \\frac{Ebh^3}{6L^2} \\sqrt{(1-\\varepsilon)^{-2/3} - 1}\n$$\nNow we substitute the given numerical values:\n$L=0.50\\,\\mathrm{m}$\n$b=50\\,\\mathrm{mm} = 0.05\\,\\mathrm{m}$\n$h=5\\,\\mathrm{mm} = 0.005\\,\\mathrm{m}$\n$E=210 \\times 10^9\\,\\mathrm{Pa}$\n$\\varepsilon=0.05$\n\nFirst, calculate the term under the square root:\n$$\n\\sqrt{(1-0.05)^{-2/3} - 1} = \\sqrt{(0.95)^{-2/3} - 1} \\approx \\sqrt{1.0348006 - 1} = \\sqrt{0.0348006} \\approx 0.1865385\n$$\nNext, calculate the coefficient:\n$$\n\\frac{Ebh^3}{6L^2} = \\frac{(210 \\times 10^9\\,\\mathrm{Pa})(0.05\\,\\mathrm{m})(0.005\\,\\mathrm{m})^3}{6(0.50\\,\\mathrm{m})^2} = \\frac{(210 \\times 10^9)(0.05)(1.25 \\times 10^{-7})}{6(0.25)} = \\frac{1312.5}{1.5} \\,\\mathrm{N} = 875\\,\\mathrm{N}\n$$\nFinally, we compute the maximum load $P^{\\star}$:\n$$\nP^{\\star} = 875\\,\\mathrm{N} \\times 0.1865385 \\approx 163.221\\,\\mathrm{N}\n$$\nRounding to three significant figures, the maximum allowable tip load is $163\\,\\mathrm{N}$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{163}\n$$", "id": "2637248"}]}
