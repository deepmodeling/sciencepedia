It is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. All necessary data, principles, and definitions are provided, and there are no contradictions or ambiguities. The problem is valid and will be solved as requested.\n\nThe derivation will proceed in two parts, consistent with the prompt. First, the second moment of area, $I_{z}$, for the rectangular cross-section will be computed from its fundamental integral definition. Second, the normal stress distribution, $\\sigma_{x}(y)$, will be derived by synthesizing the principles of kinematics, constitutive behavior, and static equilibrium.\n\nPart 1: Computation of the Second Moment of Area $I_{z}$\n\nThe second moment of area, also known as the moment of inertia of the cross-sectional area, about the centroidal $z$-axis is defined as:\n$$ I_{z} = \\int_{A} y^{2}\\, \\mathrm{d}A $$\nThe origin of the coordinate system is at the centroid of the rectangle. For a rectangular cross-section of width $b$ (constant along the $z$-axis) and height $h$ (along the $y$-axis), the differential area element $\\mathrm{d}A$ at a distance $y$ from the $z$-axis can be expressed as $\\mathrm{d}A = b \\, \\mathrm{d}y$. The integration must be performed over the entire height of the cross-section, for which $y$ ranges from $-\\frac{h}{2}$ to $+\\frac{h}{2}$.\n\nSubstituting the expression for $\\mathrm{d}A$ and the limits of integration, we obtain:\n$$ I_{z} = \\int_{-h/2}^{+h/2} y^{2}(b \\, \\mathrm{d}y) $$\nSince the width $b$ is constant, it can be taken outside the integral:\n$$ I_{z} = b \\int_{-h/2}^{+h/2} y^{2} \\, \\mathrm{d}y $$\nThe indefinite integral of $y^{2}$ is $\\frac{y^{3}}{3}$. Evaluating the definite integral gives:\n$$ I_{z} = b \\left[ \\frac{y^{3}}{3} \\right]_{-h/2}^{+h/2} = b \\left( \\frac{(h/2)^{3}}{3} - \\frac{(-h/2)^{3}}{3} \\right) $$\n$$ I_{z} = b \\left( \\frac{h^{3}}{24} - \\frac{-h^{3}}{24} \\right) = b \\left( \\frac{h^{3}}{24} + \\frac{h^{3}}{24} \\right) = b \\left( \\frac{2h^{3}}{24} \\right) $$\nSimplifying this expression yields the second moment of area for the rectangular cross-section:\n$$ I_{z} = \\frac{bh^{3}}{12} $$\n\nPart 2: Derivation of the Normal Stress Distribution $\\sigma_x(y)$\n\nThe derivation proceeds from the stated fundamental bases.\n\n1.  Kinematic Assumption: The Euler-Bernoulli hypothesis that plane cross-sections remain plane and perpendicular to the deformed longitudinal axis implies that the axial strain $\\varepsilon_{x}$ varies linearly with the distance $y$ from the neutral axis. We may write this relationship as:\n    $$ \\varepsilon_{x}(y) = -\\kappa y $$\n    where $\\kappa$ is the curvature of the beam's longitudinal axis. The neutral axis is the locus of points where $\\varepsilon_{x}=0$. The negative sign is a convention which, combined with the sign convention for the moment resultant, will be shown to be consistent with the problem statement.\n\n2.  Constitutive Law: The material is linearly elastic, described by Hooke's law. For uniaxial stress, this is:\n    $$ \\sigma_{x}(y) = E \\, \\varepsilon_{x}(y) $$\n    Substituting the kinematic relation into the constitutive law gives the stress distribution in terms of the unknown curvature $\\kappa$:\n    $$ \\sigma_{x}(y) = E(-\\kappa y) = -E\\kappa y $$\n    This shows that the normal stress also varies linearly across the cross-section depth.\n\n3.  Static Equilibrium Conditions: For pure bending, the stress distribution must satisfy two equilibrium conditions on any cross-section.\n    \n    a) Zero resultant axial force ($N$):\n    $$ N = \\int_{A} \\sigma_{x} \\, \\mathrm{d}A = 0 $$\n    Substituting the expression for $\\sigma_{x}$:\n    $$ \\int_{A} (-E\\kappa y) \\, \\mathrm{d}A = -E\\kappa \\int_{A} y \\, \\mathrm{d}A = 0 $$\n    Since for a bent beam $E \\neq 0$ and $\\kappa \\neq 0$, this requires $\\int_{A} y \\, \\mathrm{d}A = 0$. This integral is the first moment of area about the $z$-axis. The condition that it is zero confirms that the neutral axis (where $y=0$) must pass through the centroid of the cross-section, which is consistent with the problem setup.\n\n    b) Resultant internal moment equals the applied bending moment $M_{z}$:\n    The differential moment $\\mathrm{d}M_z$ produced by the force $\\mathrm{d}F_x = \\sigma_x \\mathrm{d}A$ acting on an element of area $\\mathrm{d}A$ at a distance $y$ from the $z$-axis is $\\mathrm{d}M_z = -y \\, \\mathrm{d}F_x = -y \\sigma_x \\mathrm{d}A$. The negative sign ensures that a positive (tensile) stress at a positive $y$ creates a negative moment. The total moment is the integral over the area:\n    $$ M_{z} = -\\int_{A} y \\, \\sigma_{x} \\, \\mathrm{d}A $$\n    This sign convention is consistent with the problem's statement: if $M_{z} > 0$, we expect compression ($\\sigma_x < 0$) for $y>0$. In our formula, if $\\sigma_x < 0$ for $y>0$, the integrand $-y\\sigma_x$ is positive, leading to a positive $M_z$. The convention is correct.\n    \n    Now, substitute the expression for stress $\\sigma_x = -E\\kappa y$ into the moment equation:\n    $$ M_{z} = -\\int_{A} y (-E\\kappa y) \\, \\mathrm{d}A = E\\kappa \\int_{A} y^{2} \\, \\mathrm{d}A $$\n    The integral is, by definition, the second moment of area $I_{z}$. Thus:\n    $$ M_{z} = E\\kappa I_{z} $$\n    This equation relates the unknown curvature $\\kappa$ to the applied moment $M_{z}$ and properties of the beam:\n    $$ \\kappa = \\frac{M_{z}}{EI_{z}} $$\n\n4.  Final Stress Expression: To find the final expression for stress, we substitute this result for $\\kappa$ back into the stress equation $\\sigma_{x}(y) = -E\\kappa y$:\n    $$ \\sigma_{x}(y) = -E \\left( \\frac{M_{z}}{EI_{z}} \\right) y $$\n    The Young's modulus $E$ cancels, yielding the general flexure formula:\n    $$ \\sigma_{x}(y) = -\\frac{M_{z} y}{I_{z}} $$\n    Finally, we substitute the expression for $I_{z}$ for a rectangular cross-section, $I_{z} = \\frac{bh^{3}}{12}$, which was derived in the first part:\n    $$ \\sigma_{x}(y) = -\\frac{M_{z} y}{\\frac{bh^{3}}{12}} $$\n    This simplifies to the final required expression for the normal stress distribution in terms of the specified parameters:\n    $$ \\sigma_{x}(y) = -\\frac{12 M_{z} y}{bh^{3}} $$", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{-\\frac{12 M_{z} y}{b h^{3}}} $$", "id": "2677830"}, {"introduction": "In engineering practice, we often work backwards from measurements to infer the loads acting on a structure.

It is a well-posed problem in solid mechanics, grounded in the established principles of Euler-Bernoulli beam theory. All provided data are consistent and physically reasonable. We may proceed with the solution.\n\nThe fundamental kinematic assumption of Euler-Bernoulli beam theory is that the longitudinal strain, $\\varepsilon_{xx}$, varies linearly across the depth of the beam. This can be expressed as a function of the transverse coordinate $y$, which is measured from the centroidal axis (positive upwards):\n$$ \\varepsilon_{xx}(y) = \\varepsilon_0 - \\kappa y $$\nIn this equation, $\\varepsilon_0$ represents the uniform axial strain component, which is the strain at the centroidal axis ($y = 0$). The parameter $\\kappa$ is the curvature of the beam. A non-zero $\\varepsilon_0$ is associated with a net axial force, and a non-zero $\\kappa$ is associated with a net bending moment. The problem states that the strain gauges are located at $y = +h/2$ (top, T), $y = 0$ (middle, M), and $y = -h/2$ (bottom, B).

A value $\\phi  1$ indicates that, under idealized elastic–perfectly plastic behavior with adequate ductility and stability, the cross-section can sustain a moment higher than $M_{y}$ up to $M_{p}$ with redistribution of stresses, enabling the formation of a plastic hinge in a region of pure bending. For the given slender I-section, $\\phi \\approx 1.136$ is relatively close to unity, reflecting that most of the area is concentrated away from the plastic neutral axis in thin flanges and web such that the additional capacity beyond first yield is modest compared to, for example, a solid rectangle (which has a larger $\\phi$). This interpretation assumes no local or lateral–torsional buckling before full plastification, sufficient rotation capacity to develop and maintain the plastic stress block, and no strain hardening or residual stresses.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{1.136}$$", "id": "2677822"}]}
