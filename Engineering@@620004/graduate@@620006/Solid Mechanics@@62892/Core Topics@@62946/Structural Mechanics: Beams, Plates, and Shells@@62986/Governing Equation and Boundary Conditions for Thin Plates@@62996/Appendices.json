It is a well-posed problem within the established framework of classical solid mechanics, specifically the Kirchhoff–Love theory of thin plates. All provided information is self-contained, scientifically sound, and objective. There are no contradictions, ambiguities, or violations of fundamental principles. We may, therefore, proceed with the solution.\n\nThe problem requires the analysis of a given transverse deflection field for a thin plate. The field is given as\n$$\nw(x,y) = w_{0} \\left( 1 - \\frac{x^{2}}{a^{2}} - \\frac{y^{2}}{b^{2}} \\right)\n$$\nwhere $w$, representing the transverse displacement, is a function of the in-plane coordinates $x$ and $y$. The constants $w_{0}$, $a$, and $b$ are given as positive. The deflection $w_{0}$ at the origin $(0,0)$ is the maximum deflection.\n\nThe kinematic relations of the Kirchhoff–Love theory define the plate curvatures in terms of the second partial derivatives of the deflection field. The curvature components are the bending curvatures in the $x$ and $y$ directions, denoted $w_{,xx}$ and $w_{,yy}$ respectively, and the twisting curvature, denoted $w_{,xy}$. These are computed by direct differentiation.\n\nFirst, we compute the first-order partial derivatives of $w(x,y)$, which represent the slopes of the plate's mid-surface:\n$$\nw_{,x} = \\frac{\\partial w}{\\partial x} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} \\left[ w_{0} \\left( 1 - \\frac{x^{2}}{a^{2}} - \\frac{y^{2}}{b^{2}} \\right) \\right] = -w_{0} \\left( \\frac{2x}{a^{2}} \\right) = -\\frac{2w_{0}x}{a^{2}}\n$$\n$$\nw_{,y} = \\frac{\\partial w}{\\partial y} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y} \\left[ w_{0} \\left( 1 - \\frac{x^{2}}{a^{2}} - \\frac{y^{2}}{b^{2}} \\right) \\right] = -w_{0} \\left( \\frac{2y}{b^{2}} \\right) = -\\frac{2w_{0}y}{b^{2}}\n$$\nNext, we compute the second-order partial derivatives to obtain the curvature components.\n\nThe bending curvature in the $x$-direction is:\n$$\nw_{,xx} = \\frac{\\partial^{2} w}{\\partial x^{2}} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} \\left( -\\frac{2w_{0}x}{a^{2}} \\right) = -\\frac{2w_{0}}{a^{2}}\n$$\nThe bending curvature in the $y$-direction is:\n$$\nw_{,yy} = \\frac{\\partial^{2} w}{\\partial y^{2}} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y} \\left( -\\frac{2w_{0}y}{b^{2}} \\right) = -\\frac{2w_{0}}{b^{2}}\n$$\nThe twisting curvature is:\n$$\nw_{,xy} = \\frac{\\partial^{2} w}{\\partial x \\partial y} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y} \\left( -\\frac{2w_{0}x}{a^{2}} \\right) = 0\n$$\n\nNow, we discuss the spatial variation of these curvatures. The expressions for $w_{,xx}$, $w_{,yy}$, and $w_{,xy}$ are constants; they do not depend on the coordinates $x$ or $y$. This signifies that the plate is in a state of uniform curvature. The bending curvatures $w_{,xx}$ and $w_{,yy}$ are constant everywhere, and the twisting curvature $w_{,xy}$ is zero everywhere. The shape described by $w(x,y)$ is an elliptic paraboloid, which is a surface of constant (but generally different) second derivatives.\n\nThe interpretation of these curvatures in terms of bending moments is direct. For a homogeneous, isotropic plate, the bending moments ($M_{x}$, $M_{y}$) and the twisting moment ($M_{xy}$) are related to the curvatures by the constitutive equations:\n$$\nM_{x} = -D (w_{,xx} + \\nu w_{,yy})\n$$\n$$\nM_{y} = -D (w_{,yy} + \\nu w_{,xx})\n$$\n$$\nM_{xy} = -D (1 - \\nu) w_{,xy}\n$$\nwhere $D$ is the flexural rigidity of the plate and $\\nu$ is the Poisson's ratio.\nSubstituting our calculated curvatures:\n$$\nM_{x} = -D \\left( -\\frac{2w_{0}}{a^{2}} - \\nu \\frac{2w_{0}}{b^{2}} \\right) = 2w_{0}D \\left( \\frac{1}{a^{2}} + \\frac{\\nu}{b^{2}} \\right)\n$$\n$$\nM_{y} = -D \\left( -\\frac{2w_{0}}{b^{2}} - \\nu \\frac{2w_{0}}{a^{2}} \\right) = 2w_{0}D \\left( \\frac{1}{b^{2}} + \\frac{\\nu}{a^{2}} \\right)\n$$\n$$\nM_{xy} = -D(1-\\nu)(0) = 0\n$$\nSince the curvatures are constant, the bending moments $M_{x}$ and $M_{y}$ and the twisting moment $M_{xy}$ are also constant throughout the domain defined by the deflection field. This is a state of pure bending.\n\nFinally, we consider the types of boundary restraint compatible with this deflection shape. The boundary of the deflected region is defined by the locus of points where $w(x,y) = 0$.\n$$\nw_{0} \\left( 1 - \\frac{x^{2}}{a^{2}} - \\frac{y^{2}}{b^{2}} \\right) = 0\n$$\nSince $w_{0} > 0$, this implies:\n$$\n\\frac{x^{2}}{a^{2}} + \\frac{y^{2}}{b^{2}} = 1\n$$\nThis is the equation of an ellipse with semi-axes $a$ and $b$. The condition $w=0$ along this contour means the plate must be supported along this elliptical boundary. This corresponds to either a simple support or a clamped support.\n\nTo distinguish between these, we examine the slope normal to the boundary. A clamped boundary requires zero slope normal to the boundary, $\\frac{\\partial w}{\\partial n} = 0$. The gradient vector $\\nabla w = (w_{,x}, w_{,y}) = \\left(-\\frac{2w_{0}x}{a^{2}}, -\\frac{2w_{0}y}{b^{2}}\\right)$. This vector is non-zero everywhere on the elliptical boundary. Thus, the slope is not zero, and the boundary is not clamped.\n\nA simply supported boundary requires the bending moment normal to the boundary, $M_{n}$, to be zero. We have found that the internal moments $M_x$ and $M_y$ are constant and non-zero (assuming realistic material properties). In general, a linear combination of these non-zero constant moments will not be zero all along the elliptical boundary. Therefore, a standard simply supported edge condition is also not satisfied.\n\nThe given deflection field $w(x,y)$ is biharmonic, since $\\nabla^2 w = w_{,xx} + w_{,yy} = -2w_0(\\frac{1}{a^2} + \\frac{1}{b^2})$ is a constant, and therefore $\\nabla^4 w = \\nabla^2(\\nabla^2 w) = 0$. This means the deflection is a solution for an unladen plate ($q=0$). Such a deflection can only be sustained by applying moments at the boundary. Therefore, the compatible boundary condition is one where the plate is supported to enforce $w=0$ along the elliptical contour, and a specific distribution of bending moments is applied along this edge to induce the state of uniform curvature within the plate.\n\nThe question asks for the computation of the curvature components as the final result.\nThe ordered triple of curvature components $(w_{,xx}, w_{,yy}, w_{,xy})$ is:\n$$\n\\left( -\\frac{2w_{0}}{a^{2}}, -\\frac{2w_{0}}{b^{2}}, 0 \\right)\n$$\nThis is the final analytical expression required.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n-\\frac{2w_{0}}{a^{2}} & -\\frac{2w_{0}}{b^{2}} & 0\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "2644351"}, {"introduction": "While kinematic (or essential) boundary conditions like a clamped edge are imposed by direct geometric constraint, natural boundary conditions arise from the force balance at an unconstrained edge.

It is defined as $\\delta W_{int} = -\\delta U$, where $U$ is the strain energy.\n$$ U = \\frac{1}{2} \\int_{\\Omega} M_{\\alpha\\beta} \\kappa_{\\alpha\\beta} \\, dA $$\nThe variation $\\delta U$ is:\n$$ \\delta U = \\int_{\\Omega} M_{\\alpha\\beta} \\, \\delta \\kappa_{\\alpha\\beta} \\, dA $$\nUsing the given kinematic relation $\\kappa_{\\alpha\\beta} = -w_{,\\alpha\\beta}$, the virtual curvature change is $\\delta\\kappa_{\\alpha\\beta} = -(\\delta w)_{,\\alpha\\beta}$.\n$$ \\delta U = - \\int_{\\Omega} M_{\\alpha\\beta} (\\delta w)_{,\\alpha\\beta} \\, dA $$\nTherefore, the internal virtual work is:\n$$ \\delta W_{int} = - \\delta U = \\int_{\\Omega} M_{\\alpha\\beta} (\\delta w)_{,\\alpha\\beta} \\, dA $$\nTo identify the boundary terms, we apply the divergence theorem (integration by parts) twice. First, on the index $\\beta$:\n$$ \\int_{\\Omega} M_{\\alpha\\beta} (\\delta w)_{,\\alpha\\beta} \\, dA = \\int_{\\Omega} (M_{\\alpha\\beta} (\\delta w)_{,\\alpha})_{,\\beta} \\, dA - \\int_{\\Omega} M_{\\alpha\\beta,\\beta} (\\delta w)_{,\\alpha} \\, dA $$\nApplying the divergence theorem to the first term on the right-hand side:\n$$ \\int_{\\Omega} (M_{\\alpha\\beta} (\\delta w)_{,\\alpha})_{,\\beta} \\, dA = \\int_{\\Gamma} M_{\\alpha\\beta} n_{\\beta} (\\delta w)_{,\\alpha} \\, ds $$\nWe define the transverse shear force resultant vector as $Q_\\alpha := M_{\\alpha\\beta,\\beta}$.

The boundary terms must also sum to zero. Let's analyze the boundary integral from $\\delta W_{int}$:\n$$ \\delta W_{int, b} = \\int_{\\Gamma} \\left( M_{\\alpha\\beta} n_{\\beta} (\\delta w)_{,\\alpha} - Q_n \\delta w \\right) ds $$\nWe express the gradient of the virtual displacement $(\\delta w)_{,\\alpha}$ in terms of derivatives normal ($(\\delta w)_{,n}$) and tangential ($(\\delta w)_{,s}$) to the boundary: $(\\delta w)_{,\\alpha} = n_{\\alpha} (\\delta w)_{,n} + s_{\\alpha} (\\delta w)_{,s}$.\nThe first term in the integrand becomes:\n$$ M_{\\alpha\\beta} n_{\\beta} (\\delta w)_{,\\alpha} = M_{\\alpha\\beta} n_{\\beta} (n_{\\alpha} (\\delta w)_{,n} + s_{\\alpha} (\\delta w)_{,s}) = (M_{\\alpha\\beta} n_{\\alpha} n_{\\beta}) (\\delta w)_{,n} + (M_{\\alpha\\beta} s_{\\alpha} n_{\\beta}) (\\delta w)_{,s} $$\nWe define the normal bending moment $M_{nn} := M_{\\alpha\\beta} n_{\\alpha} n_{\\beta}$ and the twisting moment $M_{ns} := M_{\\alpha\\beta} n_{\\alpha} s_{\\beta}$. Due to symmetry of $M_{\\alpha\\beta}$, we also have $M_{ns} = M_{\\alpha\\beta} s_{\\alpha} n_{\\beta}$.\nSo, $M_{\\alpha\\beta} n_{\\beta} (\\delta w)_{,\\alpha} = M_{nn} (\\delta w)_{,n} + M_{ns} (\\delta w)_{,s}$.\nThe boundary integral becomes:\n$$ \\delta W_{int, b} = \\int_{\\Gamma} \\left( M_{nn} \\delta(w_{,n}) + M_{ns} \\frac{\\partial(\\delta w)}{\\partial s} - Q_n \\delta w \\right) ds $$\nWe integrate the term with the tangential derivative by parts along the boundary contour $\\Gamma$:\n$$ \\int_{\\Gamma} M_{ns} \\frac{\\partial(\\delta w)}{\\partial s} \\, ds = [M_{ns} \\delta w]_{\\text{corners}} - \\int_{\\Gamma} \\frac{\\partial M_{ns}}{\\partial s} \\delta w \\, ds $$\nThe problem states to neglect concentrated corner forces, which corresponds to dropping the $[M_{ns} \\delta w]$ term.

The problem states to identify the coefficient of $+\\delta(w_{,n})$ as $M_{nn}$, which matches.\nThe term with $\\delta w$ is $-\\left(Q_n + \\frac{\\partial M_{ns}}{\\partial s}\\right) \\delta w$. This can be written as $+\\left(Q_n + \\frac{\\partial M_{ns}}{\\partial s}\\right) (-\\delta w)$. The problem asks to define the quantity multiplying $-\\delta w$ as the effective shear $V_n$. Therefore:\n$$ V_n := Q_n + \\frac{\\partial M_{ns}}{\\partial s} $$\nWith this definition, the internal boundary virtual work has the form:\n$$ \\delta W_{int, b} =  \\int_{\\Gamma} \\left( M_{nn} \\delta(w_{,n}) - V_n \\delta w \\right) ds $$\nThe boundary segment of the PVW is $\\delta W_{int,b} + \\delta W_{ext,b} = 0$, where $\\delta W_{ext,b} = \\int_{\\Gamma_v} v_n \\delta w ds$.\n$$ \\int_{\\Gamma_v} \\left( M_{nn} \\delta(w_{,n}) - V_n \\delta w \\right) ds + \\int_{\\Gamma_v} v_n \\delta w ds = 0 $$\n$$ \\int_{\\Gamma_v} \\left[ (v_n - V_n) \\delta w + M_{nn} \\delta(w_{,n}) \\right] ds = 0 $$\nSince the virtual displacements $\\delta w$ and its normal derivative $\\delta(w_{,n})$ are arbitrary and independent on $\\Gamma_v$ (the portion of the boundary with natural conditions), their respective coefficients must be zero.

Here $Q_\\alpha := M_{\\alpha\\beta,\\beta}$ is the transverse shear vector, $Q_n := Q_\\alpha n_\\alpha$, and $M_{ns} := n_\\alpha s_\\beta M_{\\alpha\\beta}$. The sign convention is that $v_n>0$ performs positive external virtual work when $\\delta w>0$.**\nThis statement is fully consistent with our derivation. The boundary condition is $V_n = v_n$, the definition of the effective shear $V_n = Q_n + \\frac{\\partial M_{ns}}{\\partial s}$ is correct, the definitions of the components are standard, and the description of the sign convention is accurate for the derivation performed. **Correct**.\n\n**B. The correct natural boundary condition associated with an applied line load per unit length is $Q_n = v_n$; twisting moments never contribute to the virtual work on the boundary, so no tangential derivative of $M_{ns}$ appears.**\nThis is incorrect. The effective shear is $V_n = Q_n + \\frac{\\partial M_{ns}}{\\partial s}$, not just $Q_n$. The twisting moment $M_{ns}$ contributes to the boundary virtual work through the term $\\int M_{ns} \\frac{\\partial(\\delta w)}{\\partial s} ds$, which upon integration by parts yields the $\\frac{\\partial M_{ns}}{\\partial s}$ term. **Incorrect**.\n\n**C. With the outward unit normal $\\boldsymbol{n}$ and $w$ taken positive toward $+x_3$, the correct sign convention at equilibrium is $V_n = -\\,v_n$, because the internal boundary term contains $-V_n\\,\\delta w$.**\nThis is incorrect. As derived, the relation is $V_n = v_n$. The reasoning is flawed: while the internal virtual work term is $-V_n \\delta w$, the external virtual work term is $+v_n \\delta w$. For the sum to be zero, we must have $v_n - V_n = 0$, not $v_n + V_n = 0$. **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. The line load per unit length $v_n(s)$ is conjugate to the edge rotation (slope) and must be enforced by prescribing the bending moment resultant $M_{nn} = v_n$ as the natural boundary condition.**\nThis confuses the work-conjugate pairs. The force $v_n$ is work-conjugate to the displacement $w$. The edge rotation $\\delta(w_{,n})$ is work-conjugate to the normal bending moment $M_{nn}$. The proposed boundary condition $M_{nn} = v_n$ is dimensionally inconsistent (moment vs. force per unit length) and conceptually wrong. **Incorrect**.\n\n**E. For a straight edge $\\Gamma_v$, the effective shear that balances an applied line load is $V_n = Q_n - \\dfrac{\\partial M_{ns}}{\\partial s}$; thus $V_n = v_n$ under the stated sign convention.**\nThis is incorrect.

The problem is a standard exercise in advanced solid mechanics and is well-posed.\n\n### Part 1: Derivation of the Governing PDE for Variable Bending Rigidity\n\nThe problem asks for the governing equation based on moment-curvature relations and moment equilibrium for a Kirchhoff-Love plate.\n\n1.  **Bending Rigidity, $D(x)$**:\n    The bending rigidity $D$ for an isotropic plate is defined as $D = \\frac{Eh^3}{12(1-\\nu^2)}$, where $E$ is Young's modulus, $\\nu$ is Poisson's ratio, and $h$ is the plate thickness.\n    The thickness is given as $h(x) = h_0(1+\\lambda x)$.\n    Thus, the bending rigidity $D$ is a function of $x$:\n    $$D(x) = \\frac{E [h_0(1+\\lambda x)]^3}{12(1-\\nu^2)} = \\left(\\frac{E h_0^3}{12(1-\\nu^2)}\\right) (1+\\lambda x)^3$$\n    Defining $D_0 = \\frac{E h_0^3}{12(1-\\nu^2)}$ as the rigidity at $x=0$, we have:\n    $$D(x) = D_0 (1+\\lambda x)^3$$\n\n2.  **Moment-Curvature Relations**:\n    The bending and twisting moments per unit length ($M_x$, $M_y$, $M_{xy}$) are related to the curvatures of the plate's mid-surface, described by the transverse deflection $w(x,y)$. For a plate with spatially varying rigidity $D(x)$, these are:\n    $$M_x = -D(x) \\left( \\frac{\\partial^2 w}{\\partial x^2} + \\nu \\frac{\\partial^2 w}{\\partial y^2} \\right) = -D(x) (w_{,xx} + \\nu w_{,yy})$$\n    $$M_y = -D(x) \\left( \\frac{\\partial^2 w}{\\partial y^2} + \\nu \\frac{\\partial^2 w}{\\partial x^2} \\right) = -D(x) (w_{,yy} + \\nu w_{,xx})$$\n    $$M_{xy} = -D(x) (1-\\nu) \\frac{\\partial^2 w}{\\partial x \\partial y} = -D(x) (1-\\nu) w_{,xy}$$\n    Note: Some conventions omit the negative sign, which requires a corresponding change in the equilibrium equation. The final PDE is independent of this choice.\n\n3.  **Moment Equilibrium Equation**:\n    The equilibrium of a differential plate element under a transverse load per unit area $q(x,y)$ is given by:\n    $$\\frac{\\partial^2 M_x}{\\partial x^2} + 2 \\frac{\\partial^2 M_{xy}}{\\partial x \\partial y} + \\frac{\\partial^2 M_y}{\\partial y^2} = -q(x,y)$$\n    In this problem, the load is a uniform pressure $q_0$, so $q(x,y) = q_0$.\n\n4.  **Governing PDE**:\n    Substituting the moment-curvature relations into the equilibrium equation, and using $q=q_0$:\n    $$\\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial x^2} \\left[ -D(x) (w_{,xx} + \\nu w_{,yy}) \\right] + 2 \\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial x \\partial y} \\left[ -D(x) (1-\\nu) w_{,xy} \\right] + \\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial y^2} \\left[ -D(x) (w_{,yy} + \\nu w_{,xx}) \\right] = -q_0$$\n    Multiplying the entire equation by $-1$ gives the form commonly presented:\n    $$\\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial x^2}\\Big(D(x)\\,\\big(w_{,xx}+\\nu\\,w_{,yy}\\big)\\Big)+2\\,\\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial x\\,\\partial y}\\Big(D(x)\\,(1-\\nu)\\,w_{,xy}\\Big)+\\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial y^2}\\Big(D(x)\\,\\big(w_{,yy}+\\nu\\,w_{,xx}\\big)\\Big)=q_0$$\n    This is the governing partial differential equation (PDE) for the transverse deflection $w(x,y)$ of a plate with rigidity $D(x)$. If $D$ were constant, it could be factored out of all derivatives, and the equation would simplify to the well-known biharmonic equation, $D \\nabla^4 w = q_0$. Since $D$ depends on $x$, this simplification is not possible.\n\n### Part 2: Perturbation Analysis\n\nWe are given that $|\\lambda|L \\ll 1$, which suggests a regular perturbation expansion in the small parameter $\\lambda$.\n\n1.  **Expansions**:\n    We expand the rigidity $D(x)$ and the deflection $w(x,y)$ in powers of $\\lambda$:\n    $$D(x) = D_0 (1+\\lambda x)^3 = D_0 \\left(1 + 3\\lambda x + 3(\\lambda x)^2 + (\\lambda x)^3\\right)$$\n    Keeping terms up to first order in $\\lambda$:\n    $$D(x) = D_0 [1 + 3\\lambda x + \\mathcal{O}(\\lambda^2)]$$\n    The deflection is expanded as:\n    $$w(x,y) = w_0(x,y) + \\lambda w_1(x,y) + \\mathcal{O}(\\lambda^2)$$\n\n2.  **Hierarchy of Equations**:\n    We substitute these expansions into the governing PDE and collect terms of the same order in $\\lambda$.\n    The operator form of the PDE is $\\mathcal{L}(D, w) = q_0$, where $\\mathcal{L}$ is the linear differential operator.\n    $\\mathcal{L}(D_0[1+3\\lambda x], w_0+\\lambda w_1) = q_0$\n    $\\mathcal{L}(D_0, w_0) + \\lambda \\left[ \\mathcal{L}(D_0, w_1) + \\mathcal{L}(3D_0 x, w_0) \\right] + \\mathcal{O}(\\lambda^2) = q_0$\n\n    **Order $\\mathcal{O}(\\lambda^0) = \\mathcal{O}(1)$**:\n    The terms without $\\lambda$ must balance:\n    $$\\mathcal{L}(D_0, w_0) = q_0$$\n    This corresponds to the case of a uniform plate with constant rigidity $D_0$:\n    $$\\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial x^2}\\Big(D_0\\,\\big(w_{0,xx}+\\nu\\,w_{0,yy}\\big)\\Big)+ \\dots = q_0 \\implies D_0 \\nabla^4 w_0 = q_0$$\n\n    **Order $\\mathcal{O}(\\lambda^1)$**:\n    The coefficients of $\\lambda$ must sum to zero:\n    $$\\mathcal{L}(D_0, w_1) + \\mathcal{L}(3D_0 x, w_0) = 0$$\n    The term $\\mathcal{L}(D_0, w_1)$ becomes $D_0 \\nabla^4 w_1$. The term $\\mathcal{L}(3D_0 x, w_0)$ represents the action of the operator where the rigidity is replaced by $3D_0 x$ and the deflection is $w_0$.\n    $$D_0 \\nabla^4 w_1 + \\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial x^2}\\Big(3D_0x\\,\\big(w_{0,xx}+\\nu\\,w_{0,yy}\\big)\\Big)+2\\,\\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial x\\,\\partial y}\\Big(3D_0x\\,(1-\\nu)\\,w_{0,xy}\\Big)+\\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial y^2}\\Big(3D_0x\\,\\big(w_{0,yy}+\\nu\\,w_{0,xx}\\big)\\Big) = 0$$\n    Factoring out $3D_0$:\n    $$D_0 \\nabla^4 w_1 + 3D_0 \\left\\{ \\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial x^2}\\Big[x\\,\\big(w_{0,xx}+\\nu\\,w_{0,yy}\\big)\\Big]+2\\,\\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial x\\,\\partial y}\\Big[x\\,(1-\\nu)\\,w_{0,xy}\\Big]+\\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial y^2}\\Big[x\\,\\big(w_{0,yy}+\\nu\\,w_{0,xx}\\big)\\Big] \\right\\}=0$$\n    This is the governing equation for the first-order correction $w_1$.\n\n3.  **Boundary Conditions (BCs)**:\n    The plate is simply supported on all four edges ($x=0, L$ and $y=0, B$). This means the deflection $w$ and the normal bending moment $M_{nn}$ are zero on each edge.\n    $w = w_0 + \\lambda w_1 + \\dots = 0$\n    $M_{nn} = M_{nn}^{(0)} + \\lambda M_{nn}^{(1)} + \\dots = 0$\n    These conditions must hold for any small $\\lambda$, so we equate coefficients of powers of $\\lambda$ to zero.\n    For $k \\in \\{0, 1\\}$: $w_k=0$ and $M_{nn}^{(k)}=0$ on all edges.\n\n    **On edges $x=0, L$** (normal vector in $x$-direction, $n=x$):\n    -   $w_0(0,y)=0, w_0(L,y)=0$ and $w_1(0,y)=0, w_1(L,y)=0$.\n    -   $M_x = M_x^{(0)} + \\lambda M_x^{(1)} + \\dots = 0$.\n        With the standard convention $M_x = -D(w_{,xx}+\\nu w_{,yy})$, the moment expansion is:\n        $M_x = -D_0(1+3\\lambda x+\\dots)(w_{0,xx}+\\lambda w_{1,xx} + \\nu(w_{0,yy}+\\lambda w_{1,yy})+\\dots)$\n        $M_x^{(0)} = -D_0(w_{0,xx}+\\nu w_{0,yy})$\n        $M_x^{(1)} = -D_0[w_{1,xx}+\\nu w_{1,yy} + 3x(w_{0,xx}+\\nu w_{0,yy})]$\n        So, the BCs are $M_x^{(0)}=0$ and $M_x^{(1)}=0$ at $x=0,L$.\n\n    **On edges $y=0, B$** (normal vector in $y$-direction, $n=y$):\n    -   $w_0(x,0)=0, w_0(x,B)=0$ and $w_1(x,0)=0, w_1(x,B)=0$.\n    -   $M_y = M_y^{(0)} + \\lambda M_y^{(1)} + \\dots = 0$.\n        $M_y^{(0)} = -D_0(w_{0,yy}+\\nu w_{0,xx})$\n        $M_y^{(1)} = -D_0[w_{1,yy}+\\nu w_{1,xx} + 3x(w_{0,yy}+\\nu w_{0,xx})]$\n        The BCs are $M_y^{(0)}=0$ and $M_y^{(1)}=0$ at $y=0,B$.\n\n### Evaluation of Options\n\n*   **A.
