It is scientifically grounded in the established theory of linear elasticity, is well-posed with sufficient information for a unique solution, and is expressed in objective, formal language. There are no contradictions, ambiguities, or factual unsoundness. The problem requires a standard, albeit detailed, derivation of a quantity of physical interest from a fundamental solution in solid mechanics. I will now proceed to the derivation.\n\nThe objective is to find the hydrostatic stress, defined as $\\frac{1}{3}\\sigma_{kk}$, for the displacement field generated by a point force $F_j$ at the origin of an unbounded isotropic elastic solid. This displacement field is the Kelvin solution.\n\nThe Kelvin solution for the displacement $u_i$ at a point with position vector $x_k$ due to a point force $F_j$ at the origin is given by:\n$$ u_i(x) = \\frac{1}{16\\pi\\mu(1-\\nu)} \\left( (3-4\\nu)\\frac{\\delta_{ij} F_j}{r} + \\frac{x_i x_j F_j}{r^3} \\right) $$\nHere, $\\mu$ is the shear modulus, $\\nu$ is Poisson's ratio, $r = (x_k x_k)^{1/2}$ is the distance from the origin, and $\\delta_{ij}$ is the Kronecker delta.

To find the stress, we first need the strain tensor, $\\epsilon_{ij}$, which is derived from the displacement field using the linearized strain-displacement relation:\n$$ \\epsilon_{ij} = \\frac{1}{2}(u_{i,j} + u_{j,i}) $$\nwhere the comma denotes partial differentiation (e.g., $u_{i,j} = \\frac{\\partial u_i}{\\partial x_j}$). The quantity of interest for hydrostatic stress is the volumetric strain or dilatation, $\\epsilon_{kk}$, which is the trace of the strain tensor.\n$$ \\epsilon_{kk} = \\epsilon_{11} + \\epsilon_{22} + \\epsilon_{33} = u_{k,k} = \\frac{\\partial u_k}{\\partial x_k} $$\nWe proceed by computing the divergence of the displacement field $u_k$.

Therefore:\n$$ \\frac{1}{3}\\sigma_{kk} = -\\frac{1}{3} \\frac{1+\\nu}{4\\pi(1-\\nu)} \\frac{F_j x_j}{r^3} = -\\frac{1+\\nu}{12\\pi(1-\\nu)} \\frac{F_j x_j}{r^3} $$\nThis expression reveals the dependencies requested. The dependence on Poisson's ratio $\\nu$ is captured by the term $\\frac{1+\\nu}{1-\\nu}$. For most materials, $0 \\le \\nu < 0.5$, so this factor is positive and increases with $\\nu$.\nThe dependence on the orientation between the force vector $\\vec{F}$ (with components $F_j$) and the position vector $\\vec{x}$ (with components $x_j$) is contained in the scalar product $F_j x_j = \\vec{F} \\cdot \\vec{x}$.

The hydrostatic stress is thus proportional to $\\frac{\\cos\\theta}{r^2}$. It is tensile (negative) in the direction of the force and compressive (positive) opposite to the force, and vanishes on the plane through the origin normal to the force vector.\n\nThe final expression is the derived formula for the hydrostatic stress.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{-\\frac{1+\\nu}{12\\pi(1-\\nu)} \\frac{F_j x_j}{r^3}}\n$$", "id": "2652620"}, {"introduction": "To model realistic scenarios, such as geotechnical or contact mechanics problems, we must introduce a boundary.

It describes a classical problem in the theory of linear elasticity. All provided information is standard and consistent. The problem is declared valid.\n\nThe derivation of the Boussinesq solution from the Kelvin solution via the method of images is a standard, albeit algebraically intensive, procedure in solid mechanics. The governing principle is to superpose the field of the primary singularity (the Kelvin solution for the applied force) with the fields of a system of image singularities placed in the non-physical domain ($z  0$). These image singularities are chosen such that their combined traction on the boundary ($z=0$) precisely cancels the traction produced by the primary source, thus satisfying the traction-free boundary condition.\n\nFor a point force $P$ acting in the positive $z$-direction at the origin on the surface of the half-space $z \\ge 0$, the correct solution is obtained by considering a force $P$ at a small depth $c$ (at position $(0,0,c)$) and then taking the limit as $c \\to 0$. The image system required to annul the tractions on the plane $z=0$ is complex, involving not just an image force, but also a force doublet and a center of dilatation at the image point $(0,0,-c)$. This procedure yields the Mindlin solution for an interior load. Taking the limit of the Mindlin solution as the depth $c$ approaches zero gives the Boussinesq solution.\n\nThis derivation is a foundational exercise, and its result is a cornerstone of contact mechanics.

For a tangential point force at the surface (the Cerruti problem), the image system consists of (i) a tangential point force, (ii) a normal point force, and (iii) force dipoles at the mirror point. While the full coefficients of this image system can be derived by explicitly satisfying the vanishing-traction boundary conditions, the key point for our purpose is how the Poisson’s ratio $\\nu$ enters the parts of the field that produce cross-coupling between the tangential load direction and the normal displacement component on the boundary.\n\nTo make this precise, decompose fields into volumetric (spherical) and deviatoric parts. In the Kelvin tensor, the two terms have distinct origins: the $\\delta_{ij}/r$ term is associated with the dilatational (spherical) potential and carries the explicit $(3-4\\nu)$ dependence, while the $r_{i}r_{j}/r^{3}$ term is associated with the solenoidal (deviatoric) potential and has no explicit factor of $\\nu$ other than the overall prefactor $1/[16\\pi \\mu (1-\\nu)]$. When the method of images is applied to enforce the zero-traction boundary at $z=0$, the image coefficients of the various singularities depend linearly on $\\nu$ through the Lamé ratio $\\lambda/\\mu = 2\\nu/(1-2\\nu)$, and critically, the image normal force that appears in the tangential-load image system has a coefficient proportional to $(1-2\\nu)$. This can be seen by writing the boundary traction operator in terms of $\\lambda$ and $\\mu$, and solving the linear system for image strengths: the condition that the normal traction vanish on $z=0$ when the real tangential force is present requires a compensating normal image whose amplitude contains the factor $(\\lambda+2\\mu)-2\\mu = \\lambda \\propto \\nu/(1-2\\nu)$, and after algebraic elimination, the net contribution to the boundary-normal displacement from the image system is proportional to $(1-2\\nu)$.\n\nA complementary and rigorous route uses the Maxwell–Betti reciprocity theorem to isolate the dependence on $\\nu$.

Therefore, the cross-coupling $u_{z}^{(A)}$ is proportional to the tangential displacement $u_{x}^{(B)}$ induced by a normal surface load. The latter is a component of the Boussinesq solution, whose $\\nu$-dependence arises through the factor $(1-2\\nu)$ multiplying the in-plane displacement field, whereas the normal displacement in Boussinesq carries a factor $(1-\\nu)$. Thus, by reciprocity, the normal displacement generated by a tangential load must inherit the $(1-2\\nu)$ factor.
