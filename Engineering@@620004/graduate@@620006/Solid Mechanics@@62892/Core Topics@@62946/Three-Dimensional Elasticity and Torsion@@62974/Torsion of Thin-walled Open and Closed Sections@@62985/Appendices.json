The tube is long compared to $R$, and its ends are free of restraint against warping.

It represents a a standard exercise in the mechanics of materials concerning the torsion of thin-walled members. We will proceed with its systematic solution.\n\nThe objective is to derive the Saint-Venant torsional constants for a thin-walled tube in both its closed and open (slit) configurations and then to compute the ratio of these constants. The defining relationship for the Saint-Venant torsional constant $J$ is given by $T = G J \\theta'$, where $T$ is the applied torque, $G$ is the shear modulus, and $\\theta'$ is the rate of twist per unit length.\n\nFirst, we consider the closed tube, for which we use Bredt's theory for thin-walled closed sections. The torsional constant, which we shall denote $J_{\\text{before}}$, can be derived from the relationship between torque, shear flow, and the rate of twist. The general formula for the torsional constant of a thin-walled closed section is:\n$$ J = \\frac{4 A_m^2}{\\oint \\frac{ds}{t}} $$\nwhere $A_m$ is the area enclosed by the midline of the cross-section's wall, $t$ is the wall thickness, and the integral is taken along the midline contour $s$.\n\nFor the given circular tube with mean radius $R$ and uniform thickness $t$:\nThe area enclosed by the midline is $A_m = \\pi R^2$.\nThe thickness $t$ is constant.\nThe path of integration is the circumference of the midline, so $\\oint ds = 2 \\pi R$.\n\nSubstituting these into the formula for $J$:\n$$ J_{\\text{before}} = \\frac{4 (\\pi R^2)^2}{\\frac{2 \\pi R}{t}} = \\frac{4 \\pi^2 R^4 t}{2 \\pi R} $$\nSimplifying this expression yields the torsional constant for the closed tube:\n$$ J_{\\text{before}} = 2 \\pi R^3 t $$\n\nNext, we consider the open tube, created by cutting a longitudinal slit of width $\\delta$. The problem states that the total midline length of the resulting open curved strip is $2 \\pi R - \\delta$. This geometry constitutes an open thin-walled section. For such sections, the torsional stiffness is drastically reduced compared to their closed counterparts.\n\nThe torsional constant of an open thin-walled section is found by summing the torsional constants of its constituent rectangular parts. In this case, the entire section can be treated as a single, long, narrow rectangular strip that has been curved. Under the thin-wall assumption ($R \\gg t$), the effect of curvature on the Saint-Venant torsional constant is negligible. The problem can therefore be simplified by \"unrolling\" the curved strip into a flat rectangle.\n\nThe dimensions of this equivalent rectangular strip are:\nLength: $b = 2 \\pi R - \\delta$.\nThickness: $t$.\n\nThe Saint-Venant torsional constant for a narrow rectangular cross-section ($b \\gg t$) is given by the well-established formula:\n$$ J \\approx \\frac{1}{3} b t^3 $$\nThis is a standard result from the theory of elasticity and is highly accurate for the thin-walled case where $b/t$ is large. Given the problem's assumption that $R \\gg t$, it follows that $b \\approx 2 \\pi R \\gg t$, which justifies the use of this formula.\n\nSubstituting the dimensions of our strip, we find the torsional constant for the open section, $J_{\\text{after}}$:\n$$ J_{\\text{after}} = \\frac{1}{3} (2 \\pi R - \\delta) t^3 $$\n\nFinally, we compute the required ratio, $J_{\\text{after}} / J_{\\text{before}}$:\n$$ \\frac{J_{\\text{after}}}{J_{\\text{before}}} = \\frac{\\frac{1}{3} (2 \\pi R - \\delta) t^3}{2 \\pi R^3 t} $$\nWe proceed with algebraic simplification of this ratio:\n$$ \\frac{J_{\\text{after}}}{J_{\\text{before}}} = \\frac{(2 \\pi R - \\delta) t^3}{3 \\cdot (2 \\pi R^3 t)} = \\frac{(2 \\pi R - \\delta) t^2}{6 \\pi R^3} $$\nThis expression is the final simplified result. It correctly shows that the torsional stiffness of the open section is proportional to $t^3$, whereas the stiffness of the closed section is proportional to $t$, leading to a dramatic reduction in stiffness, as indicated by the ratio's dependence on $(t/R)^2$, which is a very small quantity.", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{\\frac{(2 \\pi R - \\delta) t^2}{6 \\pi R^3}} $$", "id": "2705347"}, {"introduction": "Having seen the immense stiffness of closed sections, a critical engineer must ask: how accurate are the simple formulas we use to model them?

The comparison will be performed via an asymptotic expansion.\n\nFirst, we derive the twist per unit length, $\\theta'_{\\text{thin}}$, for the thin-walled closed-section model. This model is governed by Bredt's formulas, which arise from equilibrium and compatibility considerations.\nThe equilibrium of the applied torque $T$ and the internal shear flow $q$ is given by Bredt's first formula:\n$$\nT = 2 q A_m\n$$\nwhere $A_m$ is the area enclosed by the median line of the cross-section.

Thus, the enclosed area is:\n$$\nA_m = \\pi R_m^2 = \\pi \\left(R - \\frac{t}{2}\\right)^2\n$$\nThe twist per unit length, $\\theta'$, is related to the shear flow through Bredt's second formula, derived from strain compatibility:\n$$\n\\theta' = \\frac{1}{2GA_m} \\oint_s \\frac{q}{t(s)} ds\n$$\nwhere $G$ is the shear modulus, $t(s)$ is the wall thickness as a function of the path coordinate $s$ along the median line, and the integral is taken over the closed contour of the median line. For this problem, the shear flow $q$ and the wall thickness $t$ are constant along the contour. The formula simplifies to:\n$$\n\\theta'_{\\text{thin}} = \\frac{q}{2GA_m t} \\oint_s ds = \\frac{q L_m}{2GA_m t}\n$$\nwhere $L_m = 2\\pi R_m$ is the perimeter of the median line.

For a prismatic bar with a circular annular cross-section, the relationship between torque and twist per unit length is exact and is given by:\n$$\nT = G J \\theta'\n$$\nwhere $J$ is the polar moment of inertia of the cross-section.

It is a well-posed application of the theory of torsion for thin-walled multicell closed sections, with all necessary data and consistent physical principles provided.\n\nThe analysis of a thin-walled multicell section under torsion requires the determination of $n$ unknown constant shear flows, $q_1, q_2, \\dots, q_n$, one for each of the $n$ cells, and the single unknown rate of twist, $\\theta'$, which is common to the entire cross-section. This constitutes a total of $n+1$ unknowns. To solve for these, we must establish $n+1$ independent linear equations derived from two fundamental principles: kinematic compatibility and static equilibrium.\n\nFirst, we establish the $n$ compatibility equations. The rate of twist, $\\theta'$, is related to the shear strain, $\\gamma(s)$, integrated along the midline contour $C_i$ of any closed cell $i$ by the equation:\n$$ 2 G A_{m,i} \\theta' = \\oint_{C_i} \\tau(s) \\, ds $$\nwhere $G$ is the shear modulus, $A_{m,i}$ is the area enclosed by the midline of cell $i$, and $\\tau(s)$ is the shear stress at a point $s$ on the midline. Using the relationship between shear stress and shear flow, $\\tau(s) = q(s)/t(s)$, where $q(s)$ is the local shear flow and $t(s)$ is the wall thickness, the equation becomes:\n$$ 2 G A_{m,i} \\theta' = \\oint_{C_i} \\frac{q(s)}{t(s)} \\, ds $$\nThe cross-section is composed of discrete wall segments, each with constant thickness $t_w$ and length $L_w$. The integral can be replaced by a summation over the walls that form the boundary of cell $i$. The shear flow $q(s)$ on a given wall, denoted $q_w$, depends on which cells it separates. Let us adopt a sign convention where the shear flow $q_i$ is positive for an anticlockwise direction within cell $i$.\nFor an external wall of cell $i$, the local shear flow is simply $q_w = q_i$. For an internal wall shared by cell $i$ and cell $j$, the net shear flow is the superposition of the two cell flows. If we are traversing the boundary of cell $i$ in the anticlockwise direction, the shear flow on the common wall is $q_w = q_i - q_j$.\nThus, the compatibility equation for cell $i$ becomes:\n$$ \\sum_{w \\in \\text{walls of cell } i} q_w \\frac{L_w}{t_w} = 2 G A_{m,i} \\theta' $$\nExpanding $q_w$ for external and internal walls, we get for each cell $i \\in \\{1, \\dots, n\\}$:\n$$ \\sum_{w \\in \\text{ext. walls of } i} q_i \\frac{L_w}{t_w} + \\sum_{j \\neq i, \\text{adj. to } i} \\sum_{w \\in \\text{shared walls } i,j} (q_i - q_j) \\frac{L_w}{t_w} = 2 G A_{m,i} \\theta' $$\nThis can be rearranged by grouping the coefficients of the unknown shear flows $\\{q_j\\}$:\n$$ q_i \\left( \\sum_{w \\in \\text{walls of } i} \\frac{L_w}{t_w} \\right) - \\sum_{j \\neq i, \\text{adj. to } i} q_j \\left( \\sum_{w \\in \\text{shared walls } i,j} \\frac{L_w}{t_w} \\right) - 2 G A_{m,i} \\theta' = 0 $$\nLet us define the flexibility coefficients $\\delta_{ij}$ as follows:\n$$ \\delta_{ii} = \\sum_{w \\in \\text{walls of } i} \\frac{L_w}{t_w} = \\oint_{C_i} \\frac{ds}{t(s)} $$\n$$ \\delta_{ij} = \\sum_{w \\in \\text{shared walls } i,j} \\frac{L_w}{t_w} \\quad (\\text{for } i \\neq j) $$\nWith these definitions, the compatibility equation for cell $i$ is:\n$$ \\delta_{ii} q_i - \\sum_{j \\neq i, \\text{adj. to } i} \\delta_{ij} q_j - 2 G A_{m,i} \\theta' = 0 $$\nThis provides $n$ linear equations for the $n+1$ unknowns.\n\nSecond, we establish the final equation from static equilibrium. The applied external torque $T$ must be balanced by the internal torque generated by the shear flows in all cells. According to Bredt's second formula, the torque produced by a single cell $i$ is $T_i = 2 q_i A_{m,i}$. The total torque is the sum over all cells:\n$$ T = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} T_i = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} 2 q_i A_{m,i} $$\nThis gives the $(n+1)$-th equation:\n$$ \\sum_{i=1}^{n} (2 A_{m,i}) q_i + (0) \\theta' = T $$\n\nWe now have a complete linear system of $n+1$ equations for the $n+1$ unknowns $(q_1, \\dots, q_n, \\theta')$. In matrix form, this system, $M \\mathbf{x} = \\mathbf{b}$, is written as:\n$$\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n\\delta_{11} & -\\delta_{12} & \\cdots & -\\delta_{1n} & -2GA_{m,1} \\\\\n-\\delta_{21} & \\delta_{22} & \\cdots & -\\delta_{2n} & -2GA_{m,2} \\\\\n\\vdots & \\vdots & \\ddots & \\vdots & \\vdots \\\\\n-\\delta_{n1} & -\\delta_{n2} & \\cdots & \\delta_{nn} & -2GA_{m,n} \\\\\n2A_{m,1} & 2A_{m,2} & \\cdots & 2A_{m,n} & 0\n\\end{pmatrix}\n\\begin{pmatrix}\nq_1 \\\\\nq_2 \\\\\n\\vdots \\\\\nq_n \\\\\n\\theta'\n\\end{pmatrix}\n=\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n0 \\\\\n0 \\\\\n\\vdots \\\\\n0 \\\\\nT\n\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe computational procedure is to assemble this matrix $M$ and the vector $\\mathbf{b}$ using the geometric and material properties of the given cross-section, and then solve the system for the unknown vector $\\mathbf{x} = [q_1, \\dots, q_n, \\theta']^T$.\n\nThe algorithm for the program is as follows:\n1.  For each test case, retrieve the number of cells $n$, applied torque $T$, shear modulus $G$, midline areas $\\{A_{m,i}\\}$, and the list of walls.\n2.  Initialize an $(n+1) \\times (n+1)$ matrix $M$ and an $(n+1) \\times 1$ vector $\\mathbf{b}$ with zeros.\n3.  Process each wall $(L_w, t_w, i_\\text{left}, i_\\text{right})$. Let the cell indices be $i$ and $j$. Note that the problem uses 1-based indexing for cells, which must be converted to 0-based for matrix access.\n4.  For each wall, calculate the flexibility contribution $f_w = L_w / t_w$.\n5.  If a wall is external (e.g., $j=0$), it belongs only to cell $i$. Add $f_w$ to the diagonal element $M_{i-1, i-1}$.\n6.  If a wall is internal (separating cells $i$ and $j$), add $f_w$ to both diagonal elements $M_{i-1, i-1}$ and $M_{j-1, j-1}$. Then, subtract $f_w$ from the off-diagonal elements $M_{i-1, j-1}$ and $M_{j-1, i-1}$.\n7.  After processing all walls, the upper-left $n \\times n$ submatrix of $M$ is complete.\n8.  Populate the last column of the first $n$ rows of $M$ with the twist rate coefficients: $M_{k, n} = -2 G A_{m,k+1}$ for $k \\in \\{0, \\dots, n-1\\}$.\n9.  Populate the last row of $M$ with the torque equilibrium coefficients: $M_{n, k} = 2 A_{m,k+1}$ for $k \\in \\{0, \\dots, n-1\\}$.\n10. Set the last element of the right-hand-side vector $\\mathbf{b}$ to the applied torque: $b_n = T$.\n11. Solve the linear system $M \\mathbf{x} = \\mathbf{b}$ for $\\mathbf{x}$. The first $n$ elements of the solution vector $\\mathbf{x}$ are the shear flows $\\{q_i\\}$, and the last element is the rate of twist $\\theta'$.\n12.
