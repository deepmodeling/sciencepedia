The constraint on the derivation method (using first principles and energy considerations) is a pedagogical directive, not a flaw.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\n\nThe problem statement is valid. It is a well-posed, scientifically sound problem in the field of solid mechanics. I will now proceed with the solution.\n\n### Derivation of the Solution\n\nThe problem asks for the limiting behavior of the dominant singularity exponent $\\lambda$ as the V-notch angle $2\\alpha$ approaches zero. This limiting process transforms the V-notch geometry into that of an ideal, sharp crack. Therefore, the physics of the notch-tip field must smoothly transition to the physics of the crack-tip field.\n\nThe analysis will proceed based on two fundamental principles as requested: energy-flux considerations and symmetry.\n\n**1. Energy-Flux Considerations and the Limiting Value of $\\lambda$**\n\nThe problem explicitly directs us to use \"fundamental energy-flux considerations\". In the context of fracture mechanics, this refers to the energy release rate, $G$, associated with crack propagation. For a crack in a linear elastic material, this is equivalent to the path-independent J-integral.\n\nA central tenet of Linear Elastic Fracture Mechanics (LEFM) is that for a crack to exist in a state of impending propagation under some applied load, there must be a finite, non-zero energy release rate. The energy release rate $G$ is calculated from the work done by the stresses on the boundary of a small region surrounding the crack tip as the crack extends.\n\nThe strain energy density, $W$, scales with the square of the stress: $W \\propto \\sigma_{ij}^2$. Given that the near-tip stress field scales as $\\sigma_{ij} \\sim r^{\\lambda-1}$, the strain energy density scales as $W \\sim (r^{\\lambda-1})^2 = r^{2\\lambda-2}$.\n\nThe J-integral is computed along a path $\\Gamma$ enclosing the tip. For a small circular path of radius $r$, the line element $ds$ is proportional to $r$. The integrand of the J-integral contains terms like $W n_1$, where $n_1$ is a component of the normal vector. Thus, the J-integral scales as:\n$$ J \\sim W \\times (\\text{path length}) \\sim (r^{2\\lambda-2}) \\times r = r^{2\\lambda-1} $$\nPath independence of the J-integral means its value must be independent of the radius $r$ of the integration path as $r \\to 0$. For $J$ to be a finite, non-zero constant, the exponent of $r$ must be zero:\n$$ 2\\lambda - 1 = 0 $$\nThis yields:\n$$ \\lambda = \\frac{1}{2} $$\nIf $\\lambda  1/2$, then $2\\lambda-1  0$, and $J \\to 0$ as $r \\to 0$. This corresponds to a zero energy release rate, characteristic of a notch or a smooth corner, but not a sharp crack capable of propagation.\nIf $\\lambda  1/2$, then $2\\lambda-1  0$, and $J \\to \\infty$ as $r \\to 0$. This would imply an infinite energy release from an infinitesimal crack extension, which is physically unrealistic.\n\nThus, the only physically admissible value for the singularity exponent at the tip of a sharp crack in a linear elastic body is $\\lambda = 1/2$. This corresponds to the famous inverse-square-root singularity, $\\sigma_{ij} \\sim r^{-1/2}$, that forms the basis of LEFM and the concept of the stress intensity factor, $K$.\n\nSince the V-notch becomes a crack in the limit $\\alpha \\to 0^{+}$, its singularity exponent $\\lambda(\\alpha)$ must approach the crack-tip value:\n$$ \\lim_{\\alpha \\to 0^{+}} \\lambda(\\alpha) = \\frac{1}{2} $$\n\n**2. Symmetry and the Correction Term**\n\nThe problem asks for the behavior of $\\lambda(\\alpha)$ for small $\\alpha$. The eigenvalue $\\lambda$ is a function of the notch half-angle, $\\alpha$. The physical setup is fully described by the geometry, and the geometry is symmetric with respect to a change in sign of $\\alpha$ (i.e., a V-notch opening \"up\" is physically identical to one opening \"down\"). Consequently, the eigenvalue $\\lambda$ must be an even function of $\\alpha$:\n$$ \\lambda(\\alpha) = \\lambda(-\\alpha) $$\nThe Taylor series expansion of an even function $f(x)$ around $x=0$ contains only even powers of $x$: $f(x) = f(0) + c_2 x^2 + c_4 x^4 + \\dots$.\nApplying this to $\\lambda(\\alpha)$, we can write its expansion for small $\\alpha$ as:\n$$ \\lambda(\\alpha) = \\lambda(0) + C\\alpha^2 + \\mathcal{O}(\\alpha^4) $$\nwhere $C$ is some constant. From our energy argument, we found the limiting value $\\lambda(0) = 1/2$.\nTherefore, the behavior of the leading eigenvalue for a closing notch is:\n$$ \\lambda(\\alpha) = \\frac{1}{2} + C\\alpha^2 + \\mathcal{O}(\\alpha^4) $$\nThis means the deviation of $\\lambda(\\alpha)$ from its limiting value of $1/2$ is of order $\\alpha^2$, which is written as $\\mathcal{O}(\\alpha^2)$.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. $\\lambda(\\alpha)\\to \\tfrac{1}{2}$, and the near-tip fields approach the crack-tip inverse-square-root singularity $\\sigma_{ij}\\sim r^{-1/2}$ with a finite stress intensity factor; moreover, by symmetry, $\\lambda(\\alpha)=\\tfrac{1}{2}+\\mathcal{O}(\\alpha^{2})$ as $\\alpha\\to 0^{+}$.**\nThis statement fully aligns with our derivation.\n1.  The limit $\\lambda(\\alpha) \\to 1/2$ is required for a finite, non-zero energy release rate in the limiting crack geometry.\n2.  This limit correctly implies the $\\sigma_{ij} \\sim r^{\\lambda-1} = r^{1/2-1} = r^{-1/2}$ singularity, which defines a finite stress intensity factor.\n3.  The dependence $\\lambda(\\alpha) = 1/2 + \\mathcal{O}(\\alpha^2)$ is a direct consequence of the reflectional symmetry of the problem geometry with respect to the sign of $\\alpha$.\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\n**B. $\\lambda(\\alpha)\\to 1$, so $\\sigma_{ij}$ remains bounded at the tip and there is no crack-like singularity in the limit; any deviation of $\\lambda$ from $1$ is linear in $\\alpha$.**\nThis statement is incorrect on multiple grounds.\n1.  A limit of $\\lambda \\to 1$ would imply $\\sigma_{ij} \\sim r^{1-1} = r^0$, meaning the stress is bounded at the tip. This corresponds to a blunt notch or smooth surface, not a sharp crack, and would yield a zero energy release rate, contradicting the physics of a crack.\n2.  The leading eigenvalue, which defines the *strongest* singularity, must be the smallest admissible $\\lambda  0$. Since $\\lambda=1/2$ is the physically required value for a crack, it is the leading eigenvalue, not $\\lambda=1$.\n3.  A deviation linear in $\\alpha$ would imply $\\lambda(\\alpha)$ is not an even function, violating the geometric symmetry of the problem.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**C. $\\lambda(\\alpha)\\to 0$, so $\\sigma_{ij}\\sim r^{-1}$ and the energy release rate diverges as the notch closes into a crack.**\nThis statement is physically incorrect.\n1.  A limit of $\\lambda \\to 0$ would imply a singularity of $\\sigma_{ij} \\sim r^{-1}$. As argued previously, this would lead to a divergent energy release rate ($J \\to \\infty$), which is physically inadmissible in linear elasticity. The model would break down. The established LEFM framework, which is experimentally well-verified, is built upon the $\\lambda=1/2$ singularity.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. $\\lambda(\\alpha)\\to \\tfrac{3}{2}$, so $\\sigma_{ij}\\sim r^{+1/2}$ vanishes at the tip and the energy release rate tends to zero as the notch closes into a crack.**\nThis statement describes a non-singular field.\n1.  A limit of $\\lambda \\to 3/2$ implies that the stress $\\sigma_{ij} \\sim r^{1/2}$ vanishes at the tip. This contradicts the very nature of a crack or sharp notch, which is to act as a stress concentrator, not a stress reliever.\n2.  Such a field would indeed have a zero energy release rate ($J \\sim r^{2\\lambda-1} = r^{2(3/2)-1} = r^2 \\to 0$), but this is not the dominant, singular part of the solution that governs fracture. Higher-order, non-singular terms in the Williams expansion have integer or half-integer exponents greater than or equal to $1$, but they do not represent the leading singularity.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2711166"}, {"introduction": "Having established the conceptual link between wedges and cracks, we now turn to the analytical mechanics of deriving the near-tip fields.

For antiplane shear, the only non-zero stress components are $\\sigma_{rz} = \\mu \\frac{\\partial w}{\\partial r}$ and $\\sigma_{\\theta z} = \\frac{\\mu}{r} \\frac{\\partial w}{\\partial \\theta}$. The traction vector on a surface of constant $\\theta$ has a non-zero component only in the $z$-direction, given by $t_z = \\sigma_{\\theta z}$.

Applying the boundary conditions:\n$$ f'(\\alpha) = -\\lambda A\\sin(\\lambda\\alpha) + \\lambda B\\cos(\\lambda\\alpha) = 0 $$\n$$ f'(-\\alpha) = -\\lambda A\\sin(-\\lambda\\alpha) + \\lambda B\\cos(-\\lambda\\alpha) = \\lambda A\\sin(\\lambda\\alpha) + \\lambda B\\cos(\\lambda\\alpha) = 0 $$\nAdding these two equations gives $2\\lambda B\\cos(\\lambda\\alpha) = 0$.

We compare the exponents $2\\pi/\\alpha$ and $\\pi/\\alpha$. Since $\\alpha  0$, we have $2\\pi/\\alpha  \\pi/\\alpha$.\nAs $R \\to 0$, the term with the smaller exponent dominates the sum.

This practice problem bridges the gap between the singular solution for a sharp wedge and the regular stress field in a more realistic rounded notch.

Angles are measured in radians.\n\nNear a sharp wedge tip, the Michell-type separated-variable solution of the biharmonic equation for the Airy stress function predicts an eigenfunction expansion of the stress field in polar coordinates $(r,\\theta)$ centered at the tip, with terms scaling like $r^{\\lambda_k-1}$ for a discrete set of eigenvalues $\\{\\lambda_k\\}_{k\\ge 1}$.

A validity criterion for the sharp-wedge approximation is defined: the relative error $e(r)$ at a specific radius $r=\\eta R$ (with $\\eta \\in (0,1)$) must not exceed a tolerance $\\varepsilon \\in (0,1)$.\n\nValidation Verdict:\nThe problem is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. It describes a standard problem in linear elastic fracture and solid mechanics, dealing with the stress concentration at a rounded notch. The use of matched asymptotic expansions to connect the singular solution of a sharp feature to the regular solution of a smoothed feature is a canonical method in this field. The stated scaling of the error is consistent with results from higher-order asymptotic analyses of notch problems. All parameters and constraints are clearly defined, and the premises are physically and mathematically sound. The problem is therefore deemed **valid**, and a solution will be provided.\n\nThe solution proceeds in two parts. First, we justify the provided scaling of the relative error using the principles of matched asymptotic scaling. Second, we apply the given criterion to derive the maximum admissible ratio of the root radius to the outer length scale.\n\nPart 1: Justification of the Error Scaling\n\nLet $\\sigma_{ij}^{\\text{rounded}}(r,\\theta)$ be the true stress tensor for the rounded wedge and $\\sigma_{ij}^{\\text{sharp}}(r,\\theta)$ be the stress tensor for the corresponding sharp wedge under identical far-field loading conditions. The problem is governed by the biharmonic equation for the Airy stress function, $\\nabla^4 \\Phi = 0$, with traction-free boundary conditions on the wedge faces.\n\nIn the outer region, where the distance from the tip $r$ is much larger than the root radius $\\rho$ ($r \\gg \\rho$), the geometric details of the rounded tip are insignificant. The stress field is approximated by the solution for a sharp wedge. The leading term of this Williams-type eigenfunction expansion, which dominates the stress field near the tip ($r \\ll R$), is the singular term associated with the smallest positive eigenvalue $\\lambda_1$:\n$$\n\\sigma_{ij}^{\\text{sharp}}(r,\\theta) \\sim K_1 r^{\\lambda_1-1} f_{ij}(\\theta)\n$$\nwhere $K_1$ is the generalized stress intensity factor, which depends on the outer geometry $R$ and the far-field loading, and $f_{ij}(\\theta)$ is the dimensionless angular function. For the purpose of scaling, we consider this leading term as the sharp-wedge approximation. The problem asks for the relative error incurred by using this approximation.\n\nThe actual stress field for the rounded wedge, $\\sigma_{ij}^{\\text{rounded}}$, while regular at the notch root, must approach the sharp-wedge solution far from the tip. The deviation from the sharp-wedge approximation, $\\sigma_{ij}^{\\text{corr}} = \\sigma_{ij}^{\\text{rounded}} - \\sigma_{ij}^{\\text{sharp}}$, can be determined through a matched asymptotic expansion. This deviation is a result of the perturbation introduced by the small length scale $\\rho$.\n\nThe structure of the correction term, $\\sigma_{ij}^{\\text{corr}}$, can be deduced from scaling arguments. This term must depend on both $\\rho$ and $r$, and it must be a valid solution (or part of one) to the governing elasticity equations. Let us postulate the scaling form of the correction term as:\n$$\n\\sigma_{ij}^{\\text{corr}} \\sim K_1 \\rho^{a} r^{b} g_{ij}(\\theta)\n$$\nwhere $a$ and $b$ are exponents to be determined, and $g_{ij}(\\theta)$ is another dimensionless angular function. The coefficient is taken to be proportional to $K_1$ because the entire local field is driven by the far-field loading embodied in $K_1$.\n\nA dimensional analysis requires that $\\sigma_{ij}^{\\text{corr}}$ has units of stress. The generalized stress intensity factor $K_1$ has units of $[\\text{Stress}] \\cdot [\\text{Length}]^{1-\\lambda_1}$. Therefore, we must have:\n$$\n[\\text{Stress}] = [K_1] [\\rho^a] [r^b] = ([\\text{Stress}] \\cdot [\\text{Length}]^{1-\\lambda_1}) \\cdot [\\text{Length}]^a \\cdot [\\text{Length}]^b\n$$\nThis implies that the exponents of length must cancel:\n$$\n1 - \\lambda_1 + a + b = 0\n$$\nNext, we use the given scaling for the relative error, $e(r)$:\n$$\ne(r) = \\frac{|\\sigma^{\\text{corr}}|}{|\\sigma^{\\text{sharp}}|} \\sim \\frac{K_1 \\rho^a r^b}{K_1 r^{\\lambda_1-1}} = \\rho^a r^{b - (\\lambda_1 - 1)} = \\rho^a r^{b - \\lambda_1 + 1}\n$$\nThe problem states that this relative error scales as $C(\\rho/r)^{1-\\lambda_1}$, which is $\\rho^{1-\\lambda_1} r^{-(1-\\lambda_1)} = \\rho^{1-\\lambda_1} r^{\\lambda_1-1}$. By comparing the exponents of $\\rho$ and $r$, we obtain a system of two linear equations for $a$ and $b$:\n1. Exponent of $\\rho$: $a = 1 - \\lambda_1$\n2. Exponent of $r$: $b - \\lambda_1 + 1 = \\lambda_1 - 1 \\implies b = 2\\lambda_1 - 2$\n\nWe verify that these exponents satisfy the dimensional analysis constraint:\n$$\n1 - \\lambda_1 + a + b = 1 - \\lambda_1 + (1 - \\lambda_1) + (2\\lambda_1 - 2) = (1 + 1 - 2) + (-\\lambda_1 - \\lambda_1 + 2\\lambda_1) = 0\n$$\nThe consistency confirms that the correction to the stress field scales as $\\sigma_{ij}^{\\text{corr}} \\sim K_1 \\rho^{1-\\lambda_1} r^{2\\lambda_1-2}$. Such a term is known to arise in higher-order asymptotic theories for perturbed singularities. Its presence justifies the prescribed scaling relation for the relative error:\n$$\ne(r) \\sim \\frac{|\\sigma^{\\text{corr}}|}{|\\sigma^{\\text{sharp}}|} \\sim \\frac{\\rho^{1-\\lambda_1} r^{2\\lambda_1-2}}{r^{\\lambda_1-1}} = \\left(\\frac{\\rho}{r}\\right)^{1-\\lambda_1}\n$$\nThis completes the justification. The dimensionless constant $C$ absorbs all proportionality factors and the ratio of angular functions.\n\nPart 2: Derivation of the Maximum Admissible Root Radius\n\nThe quantitative criterion for the validity of the sharp-wedge approximation is that the relative error at a specified radius $r = \\eta R$ must not exceed a tolerance $\\varepsilon$.\n$$\ne(r = \\eta R) \\le \\varepsilon\n$$\nWe substitute $r = \\eta R$ into the error scaling law, treating it as an approximate equality for this analysis:\n$$\ne(\\eta R) = C \\left(\\frac{\\rho}{\\eta R}\\right)^{1-\\lambda_1}\n$$\nApplying the criterion gives the inequality:\n$$\nC \\left(\\frac{\\rho}{\\eta R}\\right)^{1-\\lambda_1} \\le \\varepsilon\n$$\nOur goal is to find the maximum admissible value of the ratio $\\rho/R$. We proceed to solve for this ratio:\n$$\n\\left(\\frac{\\rho}{\\eta R}\\right)^{1-\\lambda_1} \\le \\frac{\\varepsilon}{C}\n$$\nWe can rewrite the left-hand side as:\n$$\n\\left(\\frac{\\rho}{R}\\right)^{1-\\lambda_1} \\left(\\frac{1}{\\eta}\\right)^{1-\\lambda_1} \\le \\frac{\\varepsilon}{C}\n$$\nIsolating the term with the ratio $\\rho/R$:\n$$\n\\left(\\frac{\\rho}{R}\\right)^{1-\\lambda_1} \\le \\frac{\\varepsilon}{C} \\eta^{1-\\lambda_1}\n$$\nThe exponent $1-\\lambda_1$ is positive, since the problem states $0  \\lambda_1  1$. Therefore, we can raise both sides of the inequality to the power of $1/(1-\\lambda_1)$ without changing the direction of the inequality:\n$$\n\\left[ \\left(\\frac{\\rho}{R}\\right)^{1-\\lambda_1} \\right]^{\\frac{1}{1-\\lambda_1}} \\le \\left[ \\frac{\\varepsilon}{C} \\eta^{1-\\lambda_1} \\right]^{\\frac{1}{1-\\lambda_1}}\n$$\nThis simplifies to:\n$$\n\\frac{\\rho}{R} \\le \\left(\\frac{\\varepsilon}{C}\\right)^{\\frac{1}{1-\\lambda_1}} \\left(\\eta^{1-\\lambda_1}\\right)^{\\frac{1}{1-\\lambda_1}}\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\rho}{R} \\le \\eta \\left(\\frac{\\varepsilon}{C}\\right)^{\\frac{1}{1-\\lambda_1}}\n$$\nThe maximum admissible ratio, $(\\rho/R)_{\\max}$, corresponds to the case of equality:\n$$\n\\left(\\frac{\\rho}{R}\\right)_{\\max} = \\eta \\left(\\frac{\\varepsilon}{C}\\right)^{\\frac{1}{1-\\lambda_1}}\n$$\nThis expression provides the maximum root radius relative to the outer length scale for which the sharp-wedge approximation is considered valid at the evaluation radius $r=\\eta R$ within the specified tolerance $\\varepsilon$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\eta \\left(\\frac{\\varepsilon}{C}\\right)^{\\frac{1}{1-\\lambda_1}}}\n$$", "id": "2711217"}]}
