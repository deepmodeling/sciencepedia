The chosen quadratic stress function correctly generates the uniform stress field and satisfies the compatibility equation.\n\n(b) Derivation of the displacement fields $u(x,y)$ and $v(x,y)$.\n\nThe displacements are found by integrating the small-strain kinematic relations, $\\epsilon_{xx} = \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x}$, $\\epsilon_{yy} = \\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial y}$, and $\\gamma_{xy} = \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial y} + \\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial x}$, where the strains are determined from the stresses using Hooke's law for a linear isotropic material.\n\nThe three-dimensional constitutive relations are:\n$$\n\\epsilon_{xx} = \\frac{1}{E}[\\sigma_{xx} - \\nu(\\sigma_{yy} + \\sigma_{zz})]\n$$\n$$\n\\epsilon_{yy} = \\frac{1}{E}[\\sigma_{yy} - \\nu(\\sigma_{xx} + \\sigma_{zz})]\n$$\n$$\n\\epsilon_{zz} = \\frac{1}{E}[\\sigma_{zz} - \\nu(\\sigma_{xx} + \\sigma_{yy})]\n$$\n$$\n\\gamma_{xy} = \\frac{1}{G}\\tau_{xy} = \\frac{2(1+\\nu)}{E}\\tau_{xy}\n$$\nThe given stress state is $\\sigma_{xx} = \\sigma_{x}^{0}$, $\\sigma_{yy} = \\sigma_{y}^{0}$, and $\\tau_{xy} = 0$. Therefore, $\\gamma_{xy} = 0$.\n\nCase 1: Plane Stress ($\\sigma_{zz} = 0$)\n\nUnder plane stress conditions, the strains are:\n$$\n\\epsilon_{xx}^{\\mathrm{ps}} = \\frac{1}{E}(\\sigma_{x}^{0} - \\nu\\sigma_{y}^{0})\n$$\n$$\n\\epsilon_{yy}^{\\mathrm{ps}} = \\frac{1}{E}(\\sigma_{y}^{0} - \\nu\\sigma_{x}^{0})\n$$\nSince the stresses are constant, the strains are also constant.

Integrating gives $f(y) = \\omega_{0} y + u_0$ and $g(x) = -\\omega_{0} x + v_0$. The constants $u_0$ and $v_0$ represent a rigid body translation, and $\\omega_{0}$ is related to a rigid body rotation.

The integration procedure and application of uniqueness conditions are identical to the plane stress case. The resulting displacement field for plane strain is:\n$$\nu^{\\mathrm{pe}}(x,y) = \\epsilon_{xx}^{\\mathrm{pe}} x = \\frac{1+\\nu}{E}((1-\\nu)\\sigma_{x}^{0} - \\nu\\sigma_{y}^{0})x\n$$\n$$\nv^{\\mathrm{pe}}(x,y) = \\epsilon_{yy}^{\\mathrm{pe}} y = \\frac{1+\\nu}{E}((1-\\nu)\\sigma_{y}^{0} - \\nu\\sigma_{x}^{0})y\n$$\n\n(c) Commentary on the differences between the displacement fields.\n\nThe displacement fields for plane stress and plane strain are both linear in the coordinates $x$ and $y$, but the coefficients, representing the uniform strains, differ. The fundamental reason for this difference lies in the treatment of the out-of-plane ($z$-direction) behavior.\n\nIn plane stress, the body is thin and free to deform in the $z$-direction ($\\sigma_{zz}=0$). The in-plane strains are thus only a result of the in-plane stresses $\\sigma_x^0, \\sigma_y^0$ and the direct Poisson contraction/expansion they cause.\n\nIn plane strain, the body is thick and constrained against deformation in the $z$-direction ($\\epsilon_{zz}=0$). To enforce this constraint, a reaction stress $\\sigma_{zz} = \\nu(\\sigma_x^0+\\sigma_y^0)$ develops. This out-of-plane stress itself causes additional in-plane strain through the Poisson effect. For example, the contribution to $\\epsilon_{xx}$ from $\\sigma_{zz}$ is $-\\frac{\\nu}{E}\\sigma_{zz} = -\\frac{\\nu^2}{E}(\\sigma_x^0+\\sigma_y^0)$. This term accounts for the difference between $\\epsilon_{xx}^{\\mathrm{pe}}$ and $\\epsilon_{xx}^{\\mathrm{ps}}$.\n\nConsequently, for a given applied biaxial stress state $\\{\\sigma_x^0, \\sigma_y^0\\}$, a body under plane strain is effectively stiffer in the $x$-$y$ plane than a body under plane stress. This is evident by comparing the strain expressions; the magnitude of strain (and thus displacement) for a given stress is smaller in the plane strain case. For example, under uniaxial tension $\\sigma_x^0 > 0$ with $\\sigma_y^0=0$, the longitudinal strain is $\\epsilon_{xx}^{\\mathrm{ps}}=\\sigma_x^0/E$ for plane stress, but a smaller value $\\epsilon_{xx}^{\\mathrm{pe}}=(1-\\nu^2)\\sigma_x^0/E$ for plane strain, since $0 < \\nu < 0.5$ for most engineering materials.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{1}{E}(\\sigma_{x}^{0} - \\nu\\sigma_{y}^{0})x & \\frac{1}{E}(\\sigma_{y}^{0} - \\nu\\sigma_{x}^{0})y & \\frac{1+\\nu}{E}((1-\\nu)\\sigma_{x}^{0} - \\nu\\sigma_{y}^{0})x & \\frac{1+\\nu}{E}((1-\\nu)\\sigma_{y}^{0} - \\nu\\sigma_{x}^{0})y \\end{pmatrix}}\n$$", "id": "2614037"}, {"introduction": "Beyond simple fields, the Airy stress function method becomes a powerful tool for solving boundary value problems, particularly through the use of polynomial solutions to the biharmonic equation.

Second, determine the tangential displacement $u_{\\theta}$ on the hole boundary, $r=a$.\n\n**Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens**\nThe problem is a classic boundary-value problem in the theory of two-dimensional linear elasticity, commonly known as the Lamé problem for an infinite plate with a pressurized hole.\n- **Scientific Grounding**: The problem is fundamentally sound. It is based on the established principles of continuum mechanics, linear elasticity, and the Airy stress function method. The governing biharmonic equation is correct for this context.\n- **Well-Posedness**: The problem is well-posed. The governing equation, combined with the specified boundary conditions at the hole and at infinity, guarantees the existence of a unique and stable solution for the stress and strain fields.\n- **Objectivity and Clarity**: The problem is stated in precise, objective, and standard terminology of solid mechanics. There is no ambiguity in the definitions of the physical quantities or the boundary conditions.\n- **Completeness**: The problem provides all necessary information (geometry, loading, material properties, and boundary conditions) to arrive at a determinate solution.\n- **Consistency**: The given conditions are not contradictory. The unusual instruction to \"report it in meters\" is a specification of units for the final answer, which is dimensionally a length. It does not create a logical or physical contradiction, as the symbolic answer will have the correct dimensions of length, resulting in meters if all inputs are in consistent SI units.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is deemed valid. A full, reasoned solution will be provided.\n\n**Solution Derivation**\nThe problem exhibits complete rotational symmetry. The geometry (circular hole in an infinite plane), material properties (isotropic), and loading (uniform pressure) are all independent of the angular coordinate $\\theta$. This property is known as axisymmetry. Consequently, all resulting fields—stress, strain, and displacement—must also be axisymmetric. This implies that all field quantities are functions of the radial coordinate $r$ only.\n\nThe governing equation for a 2D elasticity problem in the absence of body forces is the biharmonic equation for the Airy stress function $\\phi$:\n$$ \\nabla^4 \\phi = 0 $$\nIn polar coordinates $(r, \\theta)$, this is written as:\n$$ \\left( \\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial r^2} + \\frac{1}{r} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial r} + \\frac{1}{r^2} \\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial \\theta^2} \\right)^2 \\phi = 0 $$\nDue to axisymmetry, $\\phi$ is a function of $r$ only, $\\phi = \\phi(r)$, so all partial derivatives with respect to $\\theta$ are zero. The biharmonic equation simplifies to:\n$$ \\left( \\frac{d^2}{dr^2} + \\frac{1}{r} \\frac{d}{dr} \\right) \\left( \\frac{d^2\\phi}{dr^2} + \\frac{1}{r} \\frac{d\\phi}{dr} \\right) = 0 $$\nThe general solution to this ordinary differential equation is:\n$$ \\phi(r) = C_1 r^2 \\ln(r) + C_2 r^2 + C_3 \\ln(r) + C_4 $$\nwhere $C_1, C_2, C_3, C_4$ are constants of integration.\n\nThe stress components in polar coordinates are derived from $\\phi(r)$:\n$$ \\sigma_{rr}(r) = \\frac{1}{r} \\frac{d\\phi}{dr} = C_1 (1 + 2\\ln r) + 2C_2 + \\frac{C_3}{r^2} $$\n$$ \\sigma_{\\theta\\theta}(r) = \\frac{d^2\\phi}{dr^2} = C_1 (3 + 2\\ln r) + 2C_2 - \\frac{C_3}{r^2} $$\n$$ \\sigma_{r\\theta}(r) = -\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial r}\\left(\\frac{1}{r}\\frac{\\partial\\phi}{\\partial\\theta}\\right) = 0 $$\nThe condition $\\sigma_{r\\theta}(a,\\theta)=0$ is thus automatically satisfied.\n\nNext, we apply the boundary conditions. The stresses must vanish as $r \\to \\infty$. The terms involving $\\ln(r)$ grow unboundedly as $r \\to \\infty$. To ensure finite stresses at infinity, we must set $C_1=0$. With $C_1=0$, the stresses become:\n$$ \\sigma_{rr}(r) = 2C_2 + \\frac{C_3}{r^2} $$\n$$ \\sigma_{\\theta\\theta}(r) = 2C_2 - \\frac{C_3}{r^2} $$\nApplying the condition that stresses vanish at infinity ($\\sigma_{rr} \\to 0$ as $r \\to \\infty$) requires $2C_2=0$, which implies $C_2=0$.\n\nThe stress field simplifies to:\n$$ \\sigma_{rr}(r) = \\frac{C_3}{r^2} $$\n$$ \\sigma_{\\theta\\theta}(r) = -\\frac{C_3}{r^2} $$\nNow we apply the final boundary condition at the hole's surface, $r=a$:\n$$ \\sigma_{rr}(a) = -p \\implies \\frac{C_3}{a^2} = -p \\implies C_3 = -pa^2 $$\nThe constant $C_4$ does not affect stresses and can be disregarded. The final stress field is:\n$$ \\sigma_{rr}(r) = -p\\frac{a^2}{r^2} $$\n$$ \\sigma_{\\theta\\theta}(r) = p\\frac{a^2}{r^2} $$\n$$ \\sigma_{r\\theta}(r) = 0 $$\n\nThe problem now requires the determination of the tangential displacement $u_{\\theta}$ at $r=a$. For an axisymmetric problem, the displacement vector field takes the form $\\vec{u} = u_r(r) \\hat{e}_r + u_{\\theta}(r) \\hat{e}_{\\theta}$. The strain-displacement relations in polar coordinates are:\n$$ \\epsilon_{rr} = \\frac{\\partial u_r}{\\partial r}, \\quad \\epsilon_{\\theta\\theta} = \\frac{u_r}{r} + \\frac{1}{r}\\frac{\\partial u_{\\theta}}{\\partial \\theta}, \\quad \\gamma_{r\\theta} = \\frac{1}{r}\\frac{\\partial u_r}{\\partial \\theta} + \\frac{\\partial u_{\\theta}}{\\partial r} - \\frac{u_{\\theta}}{r} $$\nFor an axisymmetric deformation, displacement components are independent of $\\theta$, so $\\frac{\\partial u_r}{\\partial \\theta} = 0$ and $\\frac{\\partial u_{\\theta}}{\\partial \\theta} = 0$.\nThe shear strain becomes:\n$$ \\gamma_{r\\theta} = \\frac{d u_{\\theta}}{dr} - \\frac{u_{\\theta}}{r} $$\nThe shear stress $\\sigma_{r\\theta}$ is related to the shear strain $\\gamma_{r\\theta}$ by $\\sigma_{r\\theta} = G \\gamma_{r\\theta}$, where $G$ is the shear modulus. Since we have found that $\\sigma_{r\\theta}(r)=0$ for all $r$, it follows that $\\gamma_{r\\theta}(r)=0$ for all $r$.\nTherefore, the tangential displacement $u_{\\theta}(r)$ must satisfy the differential equation:\n$$ \\frac{d u_{\\theta}}{dr} - \\frac{u_{\\theta}}{r} = 0 \\implies \\frac{d u_{\\theta}}{u_{\\theta}} = \\frac{dr}{r} $$\nIntegrating this equation yields:\n$$ \\ln|u_{\\theta}| = \\ln|r| + \\text{const} \\implies u_{\\theta}(r) = C r $$\nwhere $C$ is a constant. This displacement field, $u_{\\theta} = Cr$, corresponds to a rigid-body rotation of the entire plane about the origin by a small angle $C$. Since there are no applied moments and the body is unconstrained against rotation, any such rigid-body motion is trivial and can be set to zero by choosing a non-rotating reference frame. Physically, the symmetric loading cannot induce a net rotation. Thus, we must set $C=0$.\n\nThis leads to the conclusion that the tangential displacement is identically zero everywhere:\n$$ u_{\\theta}(r, \\theta) = 0 $$\nConsequently, the tangential displacement along the hole boundary $r=a$ is also zero. This result is a direct consequence of the problem's symmetry: a purely radial, symmetric loading on a symmetric body cannot produce a non-symmetric (tangential) response.\n\nFor completeness, the radial displacement $u_r$ can be found. The plane-stress constitutive relations are:\n$$ \\epsilon_{\\theta\\theta} = \\frac{1}{E}(\\sigma_{\\theta\\theta} - \\nu \\sigma_{rr}) = \\frac{1}{E}\\left(p\\frac{a^2}{r^2} - \\nu\\left(-p\\frac{a^2}{r^2}\\right)\\right) = \\frac{pa^2}{Er^2}(1+\\nu) $$\nFrom the strain-displacement relation for axisymmetric fields, $\\epsilon_{\\theta\\theta} = \\frac{u_r}{r}$.\n$$ u_r(r) = r \\epsilon_{\\theta\\theta} = r \\left(\\frac{pa^2}{Er^2}(1+\\nu)\\right) = \\frac{pa^2(1+\\nu)}{Er} $$\nThis confirms a non-zero radial displacement, but as rigorously shown, the tangential displacement is zero.\n\nThe final answer requested is $u_{\\theta}(a,\\theta)$. Based on the derivation, $u_{\\theta}(r,\\theta) = 0$ everywhere. Therefore, at $r=a$:\n$$ u_{\\theta}(a, \\theta) = 0 $$", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{0}\n$$", "id": "2614055"}]}
