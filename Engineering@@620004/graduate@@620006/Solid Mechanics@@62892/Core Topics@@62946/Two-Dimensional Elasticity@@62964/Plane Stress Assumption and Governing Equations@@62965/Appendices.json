This condition arises from the requirement that the strain components must be derivable from a single-valued, continuous displacement field $(u(x,y), v(x,y))$. The starting point is the small-strain kinematic relations:\n$$\n\\epsilon_{xx} = \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x} \\quad (1)\n$$\n$$\n\\epsilon_{yy} = \\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial y} \\quad (2)\n$$\n$$\n\\gamma_{xy} = \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial y} + \\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial x} \\quad (3)\n$$\nTo eliminate the displacements $u$ and $v$, we differentiate these equations. Assuming the displacement field is sufficiently smooth to permit the interchange of differentiation order, we proceed as follows:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial^{2}\\epsilon_{xx}}{\\partial y^{2}} = \\frac{\\partial^{2}}{\\partial y^{2}}\\left(\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x}\\right) = \\frac{\\partial^{3} u}{\\partial x \\partial y^{2}}\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial^{2}\\epsilon_{yy}}{\\partial x^{2}} = \\frac{\\partial^{2}}{\\partial x^{2}}\\left(\\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial y}\\right) = \\frac{\\partial^{3} v}{\\partial y \\partial x^{2}}\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial^{2}\\gamma_{xy}}{\\partial x \\partial y} = \\frac{\\partial^{2}}{\\partial x \\partial y}\\left(\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial y} + \\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial x}\\right) = \\frac{\\partial^{3} u}{\\partial x \\partial y^{2}} + \\frac{\\partial^{3} v}{\\partial y \\partial x^{2}}\n$$\nSumming the first two results demonstrates that their sum is equal to the third result:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial^{2}\\epsilon_{xx}}{\\partial y^{2}} + \\frac{\\partial^{2}\\epsilon_{yy}}{\\partial x^{2}} = \\frac{\\partial^{2}\\gamma_{xy}}{\\partial x \\partial y}\n$$\nThis relation, typically written as $\\frac{\\partial^{2}\\epsilon_{xx}}{\\partial y^{2}} + \\frac{\\partial^{2}\\epsilon_{yy}}{\\partial x^{2}} - \\frac{\\partial^{2}\\gamma_{xy}}{\\partial x \\partial y} = 0$, is the Saint-Venant compatibility condition for plane strain fields.\n\nThe fourth task requires the evaluation of the compatibility residual $C(x,y) \\equiv \\frac{\\partial^{2}\\epsilon_{xx}}{\\partial y^{2}} + \\frac{\\partial^{2}\\epsilon_{yy}}{\\partial x^{2}} - \\frac{\\partial^{2}\\gamma_{xy}}{\\partial x \\partial y}$ for the strain field obtained previously. We compute the necessary second-order partial derivatives:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial \\epsilon_{xx}}{\\partial y} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}\\left(\\frac{2A}{E}(x^{2} - \\nu y^{2})\\right) = -\\frac{4A\\nu}{E}y \\implies \\frac{\\partial^{2}\\epsilon_{xx}}{\\partial y^{2}} = -\\frac{4A\\nu}{E}\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial \\epsilon_{yy}}{\\partial x} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}\\left(\\frac{2A}{E}(y^{2} - \\nu x^{2})\\right) = -\\frac{4A\\nu}{E}x \\implies \\frac{\\partial^{2}\\epsilon_{yy}}{\\partial x^{2}} = -\\frac{4A\\nu}{E}\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial \\gamma_{xy}}{\\partial x} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}\\left(-\\frac{8A(1+\\nu)}{E}xy\\right) = -\\frac{8A(1+\\nu)}{E}y \\implies \\frac{\\partial^{2}\\gamma_{xy}}{\\partial x \\partial y} = -\\frac{8A(1+\\nu)}{E}\n$$\nSubstituting these constant values into the expression for $C(x,y)$:\n$$\nC(x,y) = \\left(-\\frac{4A\\nu}{E}\\right) + \\left(-\\frac{4A\\nu}{E}\\right) - \\left(-\\frac{8A(1+\\nu)}{E}\\right)\n$$\n$$\nC(x,y) = -\\frac{8A\\nu}{E} + \\frac{8A(1+\\nu)}{E} = \\frac{1}{E}(-8A\\nu + 8A + 8A\\nu) = \\frac{8A}{E}\n$$\nThe compatibility residual $C(x,y)$ is a constant, independent of $(x,y)$. Its value at the specific point $(1,1)$ is therefore $\\frac{8A}{E}$.\n\nThe fifth and final task is to explain the implication of a nonzero compatibility residual. The compatibility condition $C(x,y) = 0$ is a necessary condition for a strain field to be derivable from a single-valued, continuous displacement field in a simply connected domain. A nonzero value, $C(x,y) \\neq 0$, signifies that the strain field is \"incompatible\". This means it is mathematically impossible to find a continuous, single-valued displacement field $(u,v)$ that generates such a strain field. Kinematically, this implies that a physical body cannot be deformed into this state without creating material defects: either gaps (cracks) or overlaps (interpenetration). In the language of continuum defect mechanics, a non-zero incompatibility tensor corresponds to a non-zero density of geometrically necessary dislocations. Thus, a stress field satisfying equilibrium is not guaranteed to be a valid solution in elasticity theory; it must also produce a compatible strain field.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{8A}{E}}$$", "id": "2670063"}]}
