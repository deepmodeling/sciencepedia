It is a valid problem in continuum mechanics. We may proceed to the solution.\n\n**Derivation**\n\nThe solution requires three sequential steps: calculation of strain components, kinematic analysis of the motion, and verification of the compatibility condition.\n\n**1. Calculation of Strain Components**\nThe components of the infinitesimal strain tensor, $\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}$, in polar coordinates are defined as follows:\n- Radial normal strain: $\\varepsilon_{rr} = \\frac{\\partial u_r}{\\partial r}$\n- Tangential (hoop) normal strain: $\\varepsilon_{\\theta\\theta} = \\frac{1}{r} \\frac{\\partial u_\\theta}{\\partial \\theta} + \\frac{u_r}{r}$\n- Shear strain: $\\varepsilon_{r\\theta} = \\frac{1}{2} \\left( \\frac{1}{r} \\frac{\\partial u_r}{\\partial \\theta} + \\frac{\\partial u_\\theta}{\\partial r} - \\frac{u_\\theta}{r} \\right)$\n\nThe given displacement field is $u_r = \\alpha r$ and $u_\\theta = \\beta r$. We must first compute the necessary partial derivatives:\n- $\\frac{\\partial u_r}{\\partial r} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial r}(\\alpha r) = \\alpha$\n- $\\frac{\\partial u_r}{\\partial \\theta} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\theta}(\\alpha r) = 0$\n- $\\frac{\\partial u_\\theta}{\\partial r} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial r}(\\beta r) = \\beta$\n- $\\frac{\\partial u_\\theta}{\\partial \\theta} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\theta}(\\beta r) = 0$\n\nSubstituting these derivatives into the strain definitions yields:\n- $\\varepsilon_{rr} = \\alpha$\n- $\\varepsilon_{\\theta\\theta} = \\frac{1}{r}(0) + \\frac{\\alpha r}{r} = \\alpha$\n- $\\varepsilon_{r\\theta} = \\frac{1}{2} \\left( \\frac{1}{r}(0) + \\beta - \\frac{\\beta r}{r} \\right) = \\frac{1}{2}(\\beta - \\beta) = 0$\n\nThe nonzero strain components are $\\varepsilon_{rr} = \\alpha$ and $\\varepsilon_{\\theta\\theta} = \\alpha$. The shear strain $\\varepsilon_{r\\theta}$ is identically zero.\n\n**2. Kinematic Analysis**\nThe motion is analyzed by decomposing the displacement gradient into its symmetric part (strain tensor $\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}$) and its anti-symmetric part (rotation tensor $\\boldsymbol{\\Omega}$).\n\n- **Dilatation (Uniform Extension):** The planar dilatation is the trace of the strain tensor, $\\text{tr}(\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}) = \\varepsilon_{rr} + \\varepsilon_{\\theta\\theta}$.\n  In this case, the dilatation is $\\alpha + \\alpha = 2\\alpha$. Since the strain components are constant, this represents a uniform dilatation (or isotropic expansion/contraction) of the material. This component exists if $\\alpha \\neq 0$.\n\n- **Shear:** The shear deformation is characterized by the off-diagonal terms of the strain tensor. In the $(r,\\theta)$ basis, we found $\\varepsilon_{r\\theta} = 0$. Therefore, there is no shear deformation in this coordinate system.\n\n- **Rigid-Body Rotation:** The infinitesimal rotation of a material element is given by the rotation field $\\omega$, which is half the curl of the displacement field. In 2D, this is a scalar field. The formula for the component of the curl perpendicular to the plane is $(\\nabla \\times \\mathbf{u})_z = \\frac{1}{r}\\frac{\\partial(r u_\\theta)}{\\partial r} - \\frac{1}{r}\\frac{\\partial u_r}{\\partial \\theta}$.\n  We compute the terms:\n  - $\\frac{\\partial(r u_\\theta)}{\\partial r} = \\frac{\\partial(r \\cdot \\beta r)}{\\partial r} = \\frac{\\partial(\\beta r^2)}{\\partial r} = 2\\beta r$\n  - $\\frac{\\partial u_r}{\\partial \\theta} = 0$\n  The rotation field is $\\omega = \\frac{1}{2} (\\nabla \\times \\mathbf{u})_z = \\frac{1}{2} \\left( \\frac{1}{r}(2\\beta r) - 0 \\right) = \\beta$.\n  Since the rotation field $\\omega$ is a constant, $\\beta$, this corresponds to a uniform rigid-body rotation of rate $\\beta$. This component exists if $\\beta \\neq 0$.\n\nIn summary, the motion is a superposition of a uniform dilatation and a rigid-body rotation.\n\n**3. Compatibility Condition Verification**\nThe Saint-Venant compatibility conditions ensure that a strain field can be integrated to yield a single-valued, continuous displacement field. Since our strain field was derived from such a displacement field, it must be compatible. This serves as a consistency check.\nThe compatibility equation for plane problems in polar coordinates is:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial^2 \\varepsilon_{\\theta \\theta}}{\\partial r^2} + \\frac{2}{r} \\frac{\\partial \\varepsilon_{\\theta \\theta}}{\\partial r} - \\frac{1}{r} \\frac{\\partial \\varepsilon_{rr}}{\\partial r} + \\frac{1}{r^2} \\frac{\\partial^2 \\varepsilon_{rr}}{\\partial \\theta^2} = 2 \\left( \\frac{1}{r} \\frac{\\partial^2 \\varepsilon_{r \\theta}}{\\partial r \\partial \\theta} + \\frac{1}{r^2} \\frac{\\partial \\varepsilon_{r \\theta}}{\\partial \\theta} \\right) $$\nOur strain components are $\\varepsilon_{rr} = \\alpha$, $\\varepsilon_{\\theta\\theta} = \\alpha$, and $\\varepsilon_{r\\theta} = 0$. Since $\\alpha$ is a constant, all partial derivatives of $\\varepsilon_{rr}$ and $\\varepsilon_{\\theta\\theta}$ are zero. All derivatives of $\\varepsilon_{r\\theta}$ are also zero.\nSubstituting these into the equation:\n$$ 0 + \\frac{2}{r}(0) - \\frac{1}{r}(0) + \\frac{1}{r^2}(0) = 2 \\left( \\frac{1}{r}(0) + \\frac{1}{r^2}(0) \\right) $$\n$$ 0 = 0 $$\nThe equation is satisfied identically. The strain field is compatible.\n\n**Option-by-Option Analysis**\n\n- **A. $\\varepsilon_{rr}=\\alpha$, $\\varepsilon_{\\theta\\theta}=\\alpha$, $\\varepsilon_{r\\theta}=0$; the motion is a superposition of a uniform dilatation and a rigid-body rotation of rate $\\beta$, with no shear; the strain field is compatible.**\n  - Strain components match our derivation: $\\varepsilon_{rr}=\\alpha$, $\\varepsilon_{\\theta\\theta}=\\alpha$, $\\varepsilon_{r\\theta}=0$.\n  - Kinematic classification is correct: uniform dilatation from $\\alpha$, rigid-body rotation from $\\beta$, and no shear.\n  - Compatibility status is correct.\n  - Verdict: **Correct**.\n\n- **B. $\\varepsilon_{rr}=\\alpha$, $\\varepsilon_{\\theta\\theta}=0$, $\\varepsilon_{r\\theta}=\\beta/2$; the motion exhibits radial extension and shear but no rigid rotation; the strain field is compatible only if $\\beta=0$.**\n  - Strain components are incorrect.

All assumptions—homogeneity, isotropy, linear elasticity, plane stress—are standard and form the basis of countless valid engineering analyses.\n-   **Well-Posedness:** The problem is well-posed. The geometry, material behavior, and boundary conditions are specified completely and consistently, which guarantees the existence of a unique and stable solution.\n-   **Objectivity:** The problem is stated using precise, unambiguous terminology standard to the field of mechanics. There are no subjective or opinion-based elements.\n\nThe problem does not exhibit any of the enumerated flaws. It is scientifically sound, formalizable, complete, and its idealizations (e.g., infinite plate) are appropriate for the context.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is deemed **valid**. A rigorous derivation from first principles will now be undertaken.\n\n**Derivation of Stress Field**\n\nThe geometry of the plate and the applied loading are axisymmetric, meaning they are independent of the angular coordinate $\\theta$. Consequently, the resulting displacement, strain, and stress fields must also be axisymmetric. This leads to substantial simplification:\n-   The radial displacement $u_r$ is a function of $r$ only: $u_r = u_r(r)$.\n-   The tangential displacement $u_\\theta$ is zero: $u_\\theta = 0$.\n-   All partial derivatives with respect to $\\theta$ vanish.\n\nWe proceed by systematically applying the fundamental equations of elasticity as required.\n\n**1. Equilibrium Equations**\nIn polar coordinates, with no body forces, the two-dimensional equilibrium equations are:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial \\sigma_{rr}}{\\partial r} + \\frac{1}{r}\\frac{\\partial \\sigma_{r\\theta}}{\\partial \\theta} + \\frac{\\sigma_{rr} - \\sigma_{\\theta\\theta}}{r} = 0 $$\n$$ \\frac{1}{r}\\frac{\\partial \\sigma_{\\theta\\theta}}{\\partial \\theta} + \\frac{\\partial \\sigma_{r\\theta}}{\\partial r} + \\frac{2\\sigma_{r\\theta}}{r} = 0 $$\nDue to axisymmetry, $\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\theta} = 0$, and due to symmetry, the shear stress $\\sigma_{r\\theta}$ is zero. The second equation is identically satisfied ($0 = 0$), and the first equation simplifies to an ordinary differential equation:\n$$ \\frac{d\\sigma_{rr}}{dr} + \\frac{\\sigma_{rr} - \\sigma_{\\theta\\theta}}{r} = 0 \\quad (1) $$\n\n**2. Strain-Displacement Relations**\nFor an axisymmetric displacement field ($u_r(r)$, $u_\\theta=0$), the strain components are:\n$$ \\epsilon_{rr} = \\frac{du_r}{dr} \\quad (2) $$\n$$ \\epsilon_{\\theta\\theta} = \\frac{u_r}{r} \\quad (3) $$\n$$ \\epsilon_{r\\theta} = \\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\frac{1}{r}\\frac{\\partial u_r}{\\partial \\theta} + \\frac{\\partial u_\\theta}{\\partial r} - \\frac{u_\\theta}{r}\\right) = 0 $$\n\n**3. Constitutive Laws (Hooke's Law for Plane Stress)**\nFor a homogeneous, isotropic, linearly elastic material under plane stress conditions ($\\sigma_{zz}=0$), the stresses are related to the strains by:\n$$ \\sigma_{rr} = \\frac{E}{1-\\nu^2}(\\epsilon_{rr} + \\nu\\epsilon_{\\theta\\theta}) \\quad (4) $$\n$$ \\sigma_{\\theta\\theta} = \\frac{E}{1-\\nu^2}(\\epsilon_{\\theta\\theta} + \\nu\\epsilon_{rr}) \\quad (5) $$\nwhere $E$ is the Young's modulus and $\\nu$ is the Poisson's ratio.\n\n**4. Compatibility and Solution**\nThe compatibility condition ensures that the strain field corresponds to a continuous displacement field. For an axisymmetric problem, this condition is automatically satisfied if the strains are derived from a single-valued displacement function $u_r(r)$. Instead of working with the compatibility equation in terms of stress, we will derive a governing equation for the displacement $u_r(r)$, which implicitly enforces compatibility.\n\nSubstitute the strain-displacement relations, equations $(2)$ and $(3)$, into the constitutive laws, equations $(4)$ and $(5)$:\n$$ \\sigma_{rr} = \\frac{E}{1-\\nu^2}\\left(\\frac{du_r}{dr} + \\nu\\frac{u_r}{r}\\right) \\quad (6) $$\n$$ \\sigma_{\\theta\\theta} = \\frac{E}{1-\\nu^2}\\left(\\frac{u_r}{r} + \\nu\\frac{du_r}{dr}\\right) \\quad (7) $$\nNow, substitute these stress expressions into the equilibrium equation $(1)$. First compute the term $\\sigma_{rr} - \\sigma_{\\theta\\theta}$:\n$$ \\sigma_{rr} - \\sigma_{\\theta\\theta} = \\frac{E}{1-\\nu^2}\\left[ (1-\\nu)\\frac{du_r}{dr} - (1-\\nu)\\frac{u_r}{r} \\right] = \\frac{E}{1+\\nu}\\left(\\frac{du_r}{dr} - \\frac{u_r}{r}\\right) $$\nPlugging this and the expression for $\\sigma_{rr}$ into the equilibrium equation $(1)$:\n$$ \\frac{d}{dr}\\left[\\frac{E}{1-\\nu^2}\\left(\\frac{du_r}{dr} + \\nu\\frac{u_r}{r}\\right)\\right] + \\frac{1}{r}\\left[\\frac{E}{1+\\nu}\\left(\\frac{du_r}{dr} - \\frac{u_r}{r}\\right)\\right] = 0 $$\nThe material constants $E$ and $\\nu$ are non-zero, so we can divide them out.\n$$ \\frac{1}{1-\\nu^2}\\left(\\frac{d^2u_r}{dr^2} + \\frac{\\nu}{r}\\frac{du_r}{dr} - \\frac{\\nu u_r}{r^2}\\right) + \\frac{1}{r(1+\\nu)}\\left(\\frac{du_r}{dr} - \\frac{u_r}{r}\\right) = 0 $$\nMultiplying by $(1-\\nu^2) = (1-\\nu)(1+\\nu)$ gives:\n$$ \\left(\\frac{d^2u_r}{dr^2} + \\frac{\\nu}{r}\\frac{du_r}{dr} - \\frac{\\nu u_r}{r^2}\\right) + (1-\\nu)\\left(\\frac{1}{r}\\frac{du_r}{dr} - \\frac{u_r}{r^2}\\right) = 0 $$\nCombining terms, we obtain the governing differential equation for $u_r(r)$:\n$$ \\frac{d^2u_r}{dr^2} + \\frac{1}{r}\\frac{du_r}{dr} - \\frac{u_r}{r^2} = 0 $$\nThis is a Cauchy-Euler equation. We seek a solution of the form $u_r(r) = C r^m$. Substitution yields the characteristic equation $m(m-1)+m-1 = 0$, or $m^2-1=0$, with roots $m=\\pm 1$. The general solution for the radial displacement is therefore:\n$$ u_r(r) = C_1 r + C_2 \\frac{1}{r} $$\nwhere $C_1$ and $C_2$ are integration constants.\n\nUsing this displacement field, we find the stresses from equations $(6)$ and $(7)$:\n$$ \\frac{du_r}{dr} = C_1 - \\frac{C_2}{r^2} $$\n$$ \\sigma_{rr}(r) = \\frac{E}{1-\\nu^2}\\left[ (C_1 - \\frac{C_2}{r^2}) + \\nu(C_1 + \\frac{C_2}{r^2}) \\right] = \\frac{E(1+\\nu)}{1-\\nu^2}C_1 - \\frac{E(1-\\nu)}{1-\\nu^2}\\frac{C_2}{r^2} $$\n$$ \\sigma_{\\theta\\theta}(r) = \\frac{E}{1-\\nu^2}\\left[ (C_1 + \\frac{C_2}{r^2}) + \\nu(C_1 - \\frac{C_2}{r^2}) \\right] = \\frac{E(1+\\nu)}{1-\\nu^2}C_1 + \\frac{E(1-\\nu)}{1-\\nu^2}\\frac{C_2}{r^2} $$\nSimplifying these yields the Lamé solution form:\n$$ \\sigma_{rr}(r) = A - \\frac{B}{r^2} $$\n$$ \\sigma_{\\theta\\theta}(r) = A + \\frac{B}{r^2} $$\nwhere $A = \\frac{EC_1}{1-\\nu}$ and $B = \\frac{EC_2}{1+\\nu}$ are new constants to be determined from the boundary conditions.\n\n**5. Application of Boundary Conditions**\nThe boundary conditions for this problem are:\n1.  At the hole boundary $r=a$, the radial stress equals the negative of the applied pressure: $\\sigma_{rr}(a) = -p$.\n2.  At infinity ($r \\to \\infty$), the stresses must vanish since there are no remote loads: $\\lim_{r\\to\\infty} \\sigma_{rr}(r) = 0$ and $\\lim_{r\\to\\infty} \\sigma_{\\theta\\theta}(r) = 0$.\n\nApplying the second condition to the expression for $\\sigma_{rr}(r)$:\n$$ \\lim_{r\\to\\infty} \\left( A - \\frac{B}{r^2} \\right) = A = 0 $$\nThus, the constant $A$ must be zero. The stress field simplifies to:\n$$ \\sigma_{rr}(r) = -\\frac{B}{r^2} $$\n$$ \\sigma_{\\theta\\theta}(r) = \\frac{B}{r^2} $$\nNow, applying the first boundary condition at $r=a$:\n$$ \\sigma_{rr}(a) = -\\frac{B}{a^2} = -p $$\nSolving for $B$, we find:\n$$ B = p a^2 $$\nSubstituting this result back into the stress expressions, we obtain the final solution for the stress components.\n\n**Final Stress Expressions**\nThe in-plane stress components in the plate for $r \\ge a$ are:\n$$ \\sigma_{rr}(r) = - \\frac{p a^2}{r^2} $$\n$$ \\sigma_{\\theta\\theta}(r) = \\frac{p a^2}{r^2} $$\nAs expected, the stresses are independent of the angular coordinate $\\theta$ and decay to zero as $r$ approaches infinity. The hoop stress $\\sigma_{\\theta\\theta}$ at the hole boundary ($r=a$) is $\\sigma_{\\theta\\theta}(a) = p$, which is tensile, while the radial stress $\\sigma_{rr}(a)$ is compressive and equal to $-p$, correctly matching the applied pressure.

This suggests a solution of the form $\\Phi(r,\\theta) = f_{0}(r) + f_{2}(r)\\cos(2\\theta)$. The general solution for the stress components, derived from a suitable biharmonic stress function $\\Phi(r,\\theta)$, can be expressed in the following parameterized form:\n$$\n\\sigma_{rr} = (2A + B r^{-2}) + (-2C - 6Dr^{-4} - 4Gr^{-2}) \\cos(2\\theta)\n$$\n$$\n\\sigma_{\\theta\\theta} = (2A - B r^{-2}) + (2C + 6Dr^{-4}) \\cos(2\\theta)\n$$\n$$\n\\sigma_{r\\theta} = -\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial r}\\left(\\frac{1}{r}\\frac{\\partial \\Phi}{\\partial \\theta}\\right) = (2C - 6Dr^{-4} - 2Gr^{-2}) \\sin(2\\theta)\n$$\nThe five unknown constants $A$, $B$, $C$, $D$, and $G$ are determined from the boundary conditions.\n\nThe far-field boundary conditions as $r \\to \\infty$ are $\\sigma_{xx} \\to \\sigma_{0}$, $\\sigma_{yy} \\to 0$, $\\sigma_{xy} \\to 0$. In polar coordinates, this corresponds to:\n$$\n\\sigma_{rr} \\to \\frac{\\sigma_{0}}{2}(1 + \\cos(2\\theta)), \\quad \\sigma_{r\\theta} \\to -\\frac{\\sigma_{0}}{2}\\sin(2\\theta)\n$$\nComparing these with the general stress expressions as $r \\to \\infty$:\n$$\n\\sigma_{rr} \\to 2A - 2C \\cos(2\\theta) \\implies 2A = \\frac{\\sigma_0}{2}, -2C = \\frac{\\sigma_0}{2} \\implies A = \\frac{\\sigma_0}{4}, C = -\\frac{\\sigma_0}{4}\n$$\nThe boundary conditions on the traction-free cavity at $r=a$ are $\\sigma_{rr}(a,\\theta) = 0$ and $\\sigma_{r\\theta}(a,\\theta) = 0$ for all $\\theta$.\n$$\n\\sigma_{rr}(a,\\theta) = (2A + B a^{-2}) + (-2C - 6Da^{-4} - 4Ga^{-2}) \\cos(2\\theta) = 0\n$$\n$$\n\\sigma_{r\\theta}(a,\\theta) = (2C - 6Da^{-4} - 2Ga^{-2}) \\sin(2\\theta) = 0\n$$\nFor these equations to hold for all $\\theta$, the coefficients of the constant and trigonometric terms must vanish independently.\nFrom $\\sigma_{rr}$:\n1) $2A + B a^{-2} = 0 \\implies B = -2Aa^2 = -2\\left(\\frac{\\sigma_0}{4}\\right)a^2 = -\\frac{\\sigma_0 a^2}{2}$\n2) $-2C - 6Da^{-4} - 4Ga^{-2} = 0$\nFrom $\\sigma_{r\\theta}$:\n3) $2C - 6Da^{-4} - 2Ga^{-2} = 0$\n\nWe solve the linear system for $D$ and $G$. Subtracting equation (3) from (2) gives:\n$(-2C - 2C) + (-4G - (-2G))a^{-2} = 0 \\implies -4C - 2Ga^{-2} = 0 \\implies G = -2Ca^2 = -2\\left(-\\frac{\\sigma_0}{4}\\right)a^2 = \\frac{\\sigma_0 a^2}{2}$.\nSubstituting $G$ back into (3):\n$2C - 6Da^{-4} - 2(-2Ca^2)a^{-2} = 0 \\implies 2C - 6Da^{-4} + 4C = 0 \\implies 6C = 6Da^{-4} \\implies D = Ca^4 = -\\frac{\\sigma_0 a^4}{4}$.\n\nNow we have all constants. We can find the circumferential (hoop) stress $\\sigma_{\\theta\\theta}$ on the cavity boundary by substituting $r=a$ and the determined constants into its general expression:\n$$\n\\sigma_{\\theta\\theta}(a,\\theta) = (2A - Ba^{-2}) + (2C + 6Da^{-4}) \\cos(2\\theta)\n$$\n$$\n2A - Ba^{-2} = 2\\left(\\frac{\\sigma_0}{4}\\right) - \\left(-\\frac{\\sigma_0 a^2}{2}\\right)a^{-2} = \\frac{\\sigma_0}{2} + \\frac{\\sigma_0}{2} = \\sigma_0\n$$\n$$\n2C + 6Da^{-4} = 2\\left(-\\frac{\\sigma_0}{4}\\right) + 6\\left(-\\frac{\\sigma_0 a^4}{4}\\right)a^{-4} = -\\frac{\\sigma_0}{2} - \\frac{6\\sigma_0}{4} = -\\frac{\\sigma_0}{2} - \\frac{3\\sigma_0}{2} = -2\\sigma_0\n$$\nTherefore, the hoop stress at the boundary is:\n$$\n\\sigma_{\\theta\\theta}(a,\\theta) = \\sigma_0 - 2\\sigma_0 \\cos(2\\theta) = \\sigma_0(1 - 2\\cos(2\\theta))\n$$\nThe maximum value of this stress occurs when $\\cos(2\\theta)$ is at its minimum, which is $-1$. This happens at $\\theta = \\pi/2$ and $\\theta = 3\\pi/2$.\n$$\n\\left[\\sigma_{\\theta\\theta}\\right]_{\\max} = \\sigma_0(1 - 2(-1)) = 3\\sigma_0\n$$\n\nFinally, we must argue whether this maximum hoop stress under plane strain differs from that under plane stress.\nThe entire derivation of the in-plane stresses $(\\sigma_{rr}, \\sigma_{\\theta\\theta}, \\sigma_{r\\theta})$ proceeded as follows:\n1. Start from the equilibrium equations.\n2. Introduce the Airy stress function $\\Phi$, which satisfies equilibrium by definition.\n3. Enforce strain compatibility via the constitutive law to obtain the governing PDE for $\\Phi$.\nFor an isotropic, linear elastic material with no body forces, this process leads to the biharmonic equation $\\nabla^4\\Phi=0$, regardless of whether the plane strain or plane stress assumption is made. The derivation shows that material constants $E$ and $\\nu$ do not appear in the governing equation for $\\Phi$.\n4. The boundary conditions of the problem are specified purely in terms of tractions (stresses).\n\nSince the governing differential equation for the stress function and the boundary conditions on the stresses are identical for both plane strain and plane stress, the solution for the in-plane stress field must also be identical. The differences between the two states manifest only in the out-of-plane stress and strain components ($\\sigma_{zz}$, $\\varepsilon_{zz}$) and the in-plane strains ($\\varepsilon_{xx}$, $\\varepsilon_{yy}$, $\\varepsilon_{xy}$), which depend on the material constants. However, the in-plane stresses do not.\n\nTherefore, the maximum hoop stress at the cavity boundary is the same in both cases:\n$$\n\\left[\\sigma_{\\theta\\theta}\\right]_{\\max}^{\\text{plane strain}} = 3\\sigma_0\n$$\n$$\n\\left[\\sigma_{\\theta\\theta}\\right]_{\\max}^{\\text{plane stress}} = 3\\sigma_0\n$$\nThe ratio $\\mathcal{R}$ is consequently:\n$$\n\\mathcal{R} = \\frac{\\left[\\sigma_{\\theta\\theta}\\right]_{\\max}^{\\text{plane strain}}}{\\left[\\sigma_{\\theta\\theta}\\right]_{\\max}^{\\text{plane stress}}} = \\frac{3\\sigma_0}{3\\sigma_0} = 1\n$$", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{1}\n$$", "id": "2669605"}]}
