Consider two-dimensional modeling assumptions in solid mechanics: the plane stress assumption and the plane strain assumption. The plane stress assumption postulates that all stress components involving the $z$-direction vanish, while the plane strain assumption postulates that all strain components involving the $z$-direction vanish. Starting from three-dimensional balance of linear momentum and three-dimensional linear isotropic elasticity, and enforcing physically admissible boundary conditions on all surfaces, select the option that provides a correct counterexample geometry and loading in which plane stress is valid but plane strain predictions would be grossly inaccurate, together with a correct first-principles justification for the discrepancy.\n\nA. A thin, wide rectangular plate of thickness $t$, width $W$, and length $L$ with $t/W \\ll 1$ and $t/L \\ll 1$, loaded by a uniform in-plane tensile traction $\\sigma_{0}$ on the ends normal to the $x$-axis. The $z=\\pm t/2$ faces are traction-free. Under three-dimensional balance of linear momentum with negligible body force and traction-free top and bottom faces, a state with $\\sigma_{xz}=\\sigma_{yz}=\\sigma_{zz}=0$ is admissible and the in-plane fields depend only on $\\{x,y\\}$. Three-dimensional linear isotropic elasticity then permits a nonzero out-of-plane strain $\\varepsilon_{zz}$ due to lateral contraction, consistent with plane stress. Imposing plane strain would require $\\varepsilon_{zz}=0$, which in three-dimensional linear isotropic elasticity demands a nonzero through-thickness normal stress $\\sigma_{zz}$ scaling with $\\nu\\,\\sigma_{0}$ on the $z=\\pm t/2$ free surfaces, contradicting the traction-free boundary condition and overpredicting in-plane stiffness by a factor depending on $\\nu$.

The evaluation must be based on the fundamental principles of three-dimensional linear elasticity and equilibrium.\n\nFirst, let us establish the pertinent equations of linear isotropic elasticity. The strain-stress relations (Hooke's Law) are given by:\n$$ \\varepsilon_{ij} = \\frac{1+\\nu}{E} \\sigma_{ij} - \\frac{\\nu}{E} \\sigma_{kk} \\delta_{ij} $$\nwhere $\\varepsilon_{ij}$ are the components of the strain tensor, $\\sigma_{ij}$ are the components of the stress tensor, $E$ is the Young's modulus, $\\nu$ is the Poisson's ratio, and $\\delta_{ij}$ is the Kronecker delta. The term $\\sigma_{kk} = \\sigma_{xx} + \\sigma_{yy} + \\sigma_{zz}$ is the trace of the stress tensor.\nThe equilibrium equations, in the absence of body forces, are:\n$$ \\sigma_{ij,j} = 0 $$\nBoundary conditions involve prescribed tractions on surfaces, where the traction vector $t_i$ on a surface with normal $n_j$ is $t_i = \\sigma_{ij} n_j$.\n\nThe **plane stress assumption** is defined by $\\sigma_{zz} = \\sigma_{xz} = \\sigma_{yz} = 0$. This assumption is physically justified for thin bodies, such as plates with thickness $t$ much smaller than their in-plane dimensions $L$ and $W$. If the large faces of the plate (e.g., at $z = \\pm t/2$) are free of traction, then the boundary conditions are $\\sigma_{zz} = \\sigma_{xz} = \\sigma_{yz} = 0$ on these surfaces. Because the plate is thin, it is argued that these stress components remain negligible throughout the thickness. Under this assumption, the out-of-plane normal strain $\\varepsilon_{zz}$ is generally non-zero due to the Poisson effect:\n$$ \\varepsilon_{zz} = \\frac{1}{E} [ \\sigma_{zz} - \\nu (\\sigma_{xx} + \\sigma_{yy}) ] = -\\frac{\\nu}{E}(\\sigma_{xx} + \\sigma_{yy}) $$\n\nThe **plane strain assumption** is defined by $\\varepsilon_{zz} = \\varepsilon_{xz} = \\varepsilon_{yz} = 0$. This is physically justified for long bodies with a uniform cross-section and loading along their length, where deformation in the long direction is constrained. Forcing $\\varepsilon_{zz} = 0$ requires the development of an out-of-plane normal stress $\\sigma_{zz}$ to prevent the transverse deformation that would otherwise be caused by the Poisson effect. From the constitutive law for $\\varepsilon_{zz}$:\n$$ 0 = \\frac{1}{E} [ \\sigma_{zz} - \\nu (\\sigma_{xx} + \\sigma_{yy}) ] \\implies \\sigma_{zz} = \\nu (\\sigma_{xx} + \\sigma_{yy}) $$\nThis out-of-plane stress is generally non-zero if there are in-plane stresses.\n\nNow, we evaluate each option.\n\n**A. A thin, wide rectangular plate of thickness $t$, width $W$, and length $L$ with $t/W \\ll 1$ and $t/L \\ll 1$, loaded by a uniform in-plane tensile traction $\\sigma_{0}$ on the ends normal to the $x$-axis. The $z=\\pm t/2$ faces are traction-free. ...**\n\nThis option describes the canonical example for a valid plane stress approximation. The geometry is a thin plate ($t \\ll L, W$), and the loading is in-plane. The large faces at $z=\\pm t/2$ are traction-free, which means the boundary conditions are $\\sigma_{zz}(x,y,\\pm t/2) = 0$, $\\sigma_{xz}(x,y,\\pm t/2) = 0$, and $\\sigma_{yz}(x,y,\\pm t/2) = 0$. For a thin plate, it is a very good approximation to assume these stress components are zero throughout the body, i.e., $\\sigma_{zz} \\equiv 0$, $\\sigma_{xz} \\equiv 0$, $\\sigma_{yz} \\equiv 0$. This is the plane stress state. In this state, the plate is free to contract in the thickness direction, and the theory predicts a non-zero strain $\\varepsilon_{zz} = -\\nu(\\sigma_{xx}+\\sigma_{yy})/E$. For the specific loading given, a state of uniaxial stress $\\sigma_{xx} = \\sigma_0$ with all other stress components being zero is an exact solution to the three-dimensional elasticity problem, which satisfies all equations and boundary conditions. In this case, $\\varepsilon_{zz} = -\\nu\\sigma_0/E \\neq 0$.\n\nIf one were to incorrectly apply the plane strain assumption ($\\varepsilon_{zz}=0$), it would require a normal stress $\\sigma_{zz} = \\nu(\\sigma_{xx}+\\sigma_{yy})$ to suppress the thickness change. For the given loading, this would mean a stress of order $\\sigma_{zz} \\approx \\nu\\sigma_0$ must exist throughout the plate. This directly contradicts the physical boundary condition that the faces at $z=\\pm t/2$ are traction-free, and thus $\\sigma_{zz}$ must be zero on these surfaces. A model that requires a non-zero stress on a free surface is physically incorrect. Furthermore, enforcing $\\varepsilon_{zz}=0$ artificially stiffens the material's response in the $xy$-plane. For instance, in uniaxial tension, the effective Young's modulus becomes $E' = E/(1-\\nu^2) > E$. This would lead to a gross underestimation of the in-plane strains for a given stress. The justification provided in this option is entirely correct and derived from first principles.\n\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. An infinitely long, thick-walled circular cylinder subjected to internal pressure, analyzed far from the ends where end effects are negligible. ...**\n\nThis option describes the canonical example for a valid plane strain approximation. The geometry is long and has a constant cross-section, and the loading is uniform along the length. These are the classic conditions where axial strain $\\varepsilon_{zz}$ is constrained, making the plane strain model ($\\varepsilon_{zz} \\approx 0$) the appropriate choice. Consequently, plane stress ($\\sigma_{zz}=0$) would be a poor approximation as it ignores the significant axial stress required to enforce the zero-strain condition. This option presents a scenario where plane strain is valid and plane stress is inaccurate. The problem asks for the reverse.\n\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. A thin plate of thickness $t$ and large in-plane dimensions subjected to uniform in-plane shear traction $\\tau_{xy}$ on its lateral edges, with the $z=\\pm t/2$ faces traction-free. ...**\n\nThis option describes a thin plate, for which plane stress is the appropriate model. The option incorrectly claims, \"Because the plate is thin, plane strain is better than plane stress\". This is a fundamental error. For thin structures with traction-free faces, the plane stress assumption is physically more realistic because the body is free to deform in the thickness direction. The plane strain assumption, which implies constraint in the thickness direction, is inappropriate. While for a state of pure shear, where $\\sigma_{xx}=\\sigma_{yy}=0$, both assumptions would yield $\\varepsilon_{zz}=0$ and $\\sigma_{zz}=0$, the general assertion that plane strain is *better* for a thin plate is false.\n\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. A thin plate whose $z=\\pm t/2$ faces are perfectly bonded to rigid platens that prevent any thickness change, subjected to uniform in-plane tensile displacement in the $x$-direction at its ends. ...**\n\nThis option describes a thin plate, but with a crucial boundary condition: the faces are bonded to rigid platens that prevent thickness change. This kinematic constraint directly imposes the condition that the change in thickness is zero, which means the normal strain in the thickness direction is zero: $\\varepsilon_{zz}=0$. This is, by definition, a state of plane strain. The option correctly identifies that \"The bonding enforces $\\varepsilon_{zz}\\approx 0$\". However, it then incorrectly concludes \"so plane stress is valid\". This is a non-sequitur. The condition $\\varepsilon_{zz}=0$ requires a non-zero stress $\\sigma_{zz}$ to develop, which violates the plane stress assumption ($\\sigma_{zz}=0$). The option further claims that plane strain would produce a \"nonphysical $\\sigma_{zz}$\". This is also incorrect; the stress $\\sigma_{zz}$ is the real, physical reaction force from the rigid platens needed to enforce the $\\varepsilon_{zz}=0$ constraint. Therefore, this is a problem of plane strain, and the reasoning presented is entirely flawed.\n\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\nBased on the analysis, only option A correctly identifies a scenario where plane stress is valid while plane strain is not, and provides a rigorous, physically sound justification for it.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2669587"}, {"introduction": "A key consequence of the plane strain assumption is the development of an out-of-plane normal stress, $\\sigma_{zz}$, even in the absence of any out-of-plane loading.

The relevant stress components are:\n$$ \\sigma_{xx} = \\lambda(\\varepsilon_{xx} + \\varepsilon_{yy}) + 2\\mu\\varepsilon_{xx} = (\\lambda + 2\\mu)\\varepsilon_{xx} + \\lambda\\varepsilon_{yy} $$\n$$ \\sigma_{yy} = \\lambda(\\varepsilon_{xx} + \\varepsilon_{yy}) + 2\\mu\\varepsilon_{yy} = \\lambda\\varepsilon_{xx} + (\\lambda + 2\\mu)\\varepsilon_{yy} $$\n$$ \\sigma_{xy} = 2\\mu\\varepsilon_{xy} $$\n\nThe small-strain kinematic relations connect strains to the displacement field $\\mathbf{u}=(u,v)$:\n$$ \\varepsilon_{xx} = \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x}, \\quad \\varepsilon_{yy} = \\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial y}, \\quad \\varepsilon_{xy} = \\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial y} + \\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial x}\\right) $$\nSubstituting these strains into the stress expressions, and then the stresses into the equilibrium equations, yields the governing equations in terms of displacements.\nFor the first equilibrium equation:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}\\left((\\lambda + 2\\mu)\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x} + \\lambda\\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial y}\\right) + \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}\\left(\\mu\\left(\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial y} + \\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial x}\\right)\\right) = 0 $$\nFor the second equilibrium equation:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}\\left(\\mu\\left(\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial y} + \\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial x}\\right)\\right) + \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}\\left(\\lambda\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x} + (\\lambda + 2\\mu)\\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial y}\\right) = 0 $$\nAssuming the material is homogeneous, $\\lambda$ and $\\mu$ are constants. We can expand and rearrange these equations:\n$$ (\\lambda + 2\\mu)\\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial x^2} + \\lambda\\frac{\\partial^2 v}{\\partial x \\partial y} + \\mu\\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial y^2} + \\mu\\frac{\\partial^2 v}{\\partial y \\partial x} = 0 $$\n$$ \\mu\\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial x \\partial y} + \\mu\\frac{\\partial^2 v}{\\partial x^2} + \\lambda\\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial y \\partial x} + (\\lambda + 2\\mu)\\frac{\\partial^2 v}{\\partial y^2} = 0 $$\nGrouping terms by $u$ and $v$ and using the identity $\\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial x\\partial y} = \\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial y\\partial x}$:\n$$ \\mu\\left(\\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial x^2} + \\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial y^2}\\right) + (\\lambda + \\mu)\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}\\left(\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x} + \\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial y}\\right) = 0 $$\n$$ \\mu\\left(\\frac{\\partial^2 v}{\\partial x^2} + \\frac{\\partial^2 v}{\\partial y^2}\\right) + (\\lambda + \\mu)\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}\\left(\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x} + \\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial y}\\right) = 0 $$\nIn vector notation, where $\\mathbf{u} = (u,v)$, $\\nabla^2$ is the two-dimensional Laplacian operator, and $\\nabla$ is the two-dimensional gradient operator, these equations combine into the Navier equations for plane strain:\n$$ \\mu\\nabla^2\\mathbf{u} + (\\lambda+\\mu)\\nabla(\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{u}) = \\mathbf{0} $$\n\n**Part 2: Determination of the Displacement Field**\n\nThe problem provides Dirichlet boundary conditions over the entire boundary $\\partial\\Omega$:\n$$ \\mathbf{u}(x,y)\\big|_{\\partial\\Omega} = \\big(\\varepsilon_0\\, x,\\; 0,\\; 0\\big) $$\nLet us test the candidate displacement field $\\mathbf{u}(x,y) = (\\varepsilon_0 x, 0, 0)$ over the entire domain $\\Omega$. This field is linear and continuous. By construction, it satisfies the boundary conditions. We must verify if it satisfies the Navier equations.\nLet $u(x,y) = \\varepsilon_0 x$ and $v(x,y) = 0$. We compute the necessary derivatives:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x} = \\varepsilon_0, \\quad \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial y} = 0, \\quad \\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial x^2} = 0, \\quad \\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial y^2} = 0 $$\nAll derivatives of $v(x,y)=0$ are zero.\nThe divergence of the displacement field is $\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{u} = \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x} + \\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial y} = \\varepsilon_0 + 0 = \\varepsilon_0$.\nThe gradient of the divergence is $\\nabla(\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{u}) = \\nabla(\\varepsilon_0) = \\mathbf{0}$.\nThe Laplacian of the displacement vector is $\\nabla^2 \\mathbf{u} = (\\nabla^2 u, \\nabla^2 v) = (0, 0)$.\nSubstituting these into the Navier equation:\n$$ \\mu(\\mathbf{0}) + (\\lambda+\\mu)(\\mathbf{0}) = \\mathbf{0} $$\nThe equation is satisfied. Since the proposed displacement field satisfies both the governing differential equations and the boundary conditions, and the solution to this boundary value problem is unique, this is the correct displacement field:\n$$ \\mathbf{u}(x,y) = (\\varepsilon_0 x, 0, 0) $$\n\n**Part 3: Calculation of Stress Components**\n\nUsing the determined displacement field, we first compute the components of the infinitesimal strain tensor:\n$$ \\varepsilon_{xx} = \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x} = \\varepsilon_0 $$\n$$ \\varepsilon_{yy} = \\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial y} = 0 $$\n$$ \\varepsilon_{xy} = \\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial y} + \\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial x}\\right) = \\frac{1}{2}(0+0) = 0 $$\nThe problem formulation also enforces the plane strain conditions $\\varepsilon_{zz} = \\varepsilon_{xz} = \\varepsilon_{yz} = 0$.\nThe only non-zero strain component is $\\varepsilon_{xx} = \\varepsilon_0$. This corresponds to a state of uniform uniaxial strain.\n\nWe now use the three-dimensional Hooke's law to find the stress components:\n$$ \\sigma_{ij} = \\lambda \\delta_{ij} \\varepsilon_{kk} + 2\\mu \\varepsilon_{ij} $$\nThe trace of the strain tensor is $\\varepsilon_{kk} = \\varepsilon_{xx} + \\varepsilon_{yy} + \\varepsilon_{zz} = \\varepsilon_0 + 0 + 0 = \\varepsilon_0$.\nThe nonzero stress components are the normal stresses:\n$$ \\sigma_{xx} = \\lambda \\varepsilon_{kk} + 2\\mu \\varepsilon_{xx} = \\lambda\\varepsilon_0 + 2\\mu\\varepsilon_0 = (\\lambda + 2\\mu)\\varepsilon_0 $$\n$$ \\sigma_{yy} = \\lambda \\varepsilon_{kk} + 2\\mu \\varepsilon_{yy} = \\lambda\\varepsilon_0 + 2\\mu(0) = \\lambda\\varepsilon_0 $$\n$$ \\sigma_{zz} = \\lambda \\varepsilon_{kk} + 2\\mu \\varepsilon_{zz} = \\lambda\\varepsilon_0 + 2\\mu(0) = \\lambda\\varepsilon_0 $$\nAll shear stress components are zero because the corresponding shear strain components are zero.\n\nTo provide the final answer in terms of Young's modulus $E$ and Poisson's ratio $\\nu$, we use the relations for the LamÃ© parameters:\n$$ \\lambda = \\frac{E\\nu}{(1+\\nu)(1-2\\nu)}, \\quad \\mu = \\frac{E}{2(1+\\nu)} $$\nSubstituting these into the stress expressions:\n$$ \\sigma_{yy} = \\sigma_{zz} = \\lambda\\varepsilon_0 = \\frac{E\\nu\\varepsilon_0}{(1+\\nu)(1-2\\nu)} $$\nFor $\\sigma_{xx}$:\n$$ \\sigma_{xx} = (\\lambda + 2\\mu)\\varepsilon_0 = \\left( \\frac{E\\nu}{(1+\\nu)(1-2\\nu)} + 2 \\cdot \\frac{E}{2(1+\\nu)} \\right)\\varepsilon_0 $$\n$$ \\sigma_{xx} = \\left( \\frac{E\\nu}{(1+\\nu)(1-2\\nu)} + \\frac{E}{1+\\nu} \\right)\\varepsilon_0 $$\nTo combine the terms, we find a common denominator:\n$$ \\sigma_{xx} = \\left( \\frac{E\\nu}{(1+\\nu)(1-2\\nu)} + \\frac{E(1-2\\nu)}{(1+\\nu)(1-2\\nu)} \\right)\\varepsilon_0 $$\n$$ \\sigma_{xx} = \\frac{E(\\nu + 1 - 2\\nu)}{(1+\\nu)(1-2\\nu)}\\varepsilon_0 = \\frac{E(1-\\nu)}{(1+\\nu)(1-2\\nu)}\\varepsilon_0 $$\nThese expressions for $\\sigma_{xx}$, $\\sigma_{yy}$, and $\\sigma_{zz}$ are constant throughout the domain $\\Omega$. Their units are those of pressure (Pascals in the SI system), as $E$ is in Pascals and $\\nu, \\varepsilon_0$ are dimensionless.\n\nThe nonzero stress components are:\n$$ \\sigma_{xx} = \\frac{E(1-\\nu)\\varepsilon_0}{(1+\\nu)(1-2\\nu)} $$\n$$ \\sigma_{yy} = \\frac{E\\nu\\varepsilon_0}{(1+\\nu)(1-2\\nu)} $$\n$$ \\sigma_{zz} = \\frac{E\\nu\\varepsilon_0}{(1+\\nu)(1-2\\nu)} $$", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{ \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{E(1-\\nu)\\varepsilon_0}{(1+\\nu)(1-2\\nu)} & \\frac{E\\nu\\varepsilon_0}{(1+\\nu)(1-2\\nu)} & \\frac{E\\nu\\varepsilon_0}{(1+\\nu)(1-2\\nu)} \\end{pmatrix} } $$", "id": "2669578"}]}
