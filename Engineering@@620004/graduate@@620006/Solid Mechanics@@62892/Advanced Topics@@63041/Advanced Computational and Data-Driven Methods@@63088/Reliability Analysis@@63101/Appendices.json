The final answer must be only that expression.", "solution": "The problem statement is a valid and well-posed exercise in fundamental structural reliability analysis. It is scientifically grounded, requires no external information, and is free of ambiguity. We will proceed to derive the solution from first principles as requested.\n\nThe failure of the tie rod is defined by the limit-state function $g(X) \\leq 0$, where $g(X) = R - X$. The demand $X$ is a Gaussian random variable, $X \\sim \\mathcal{N}(\\mu_{X}, \\sigma_{X}^{2})$, and the resistance $R$ is a deterministic value. The probability of failure, $P_{f}$, is the probability of the failure event:\n$$P_{f} = P(g(X) \\leq 0) = P(R - X \\leq 0) = P(X \\geq R)$$\nTo evaluate this probability, a standard normal random variable $U \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0, 1)$ is introduced through the transformation:\n$$U = \\frac{X - \\mu_{X}}{\\sigma_{X}}$$\nThe failure condition $X \\geq R$ is then expressed in terms of $U$ as:\n$$X \\geq R \\implies \\mu_X + \\sigma_X U \\geq R \\implies U \\geq \\frac{R - \\mu_X}{\\sigma_X}$$\nThe failure probability $P_{f}$ is the area of the tail of the standard normal distribution. Denoting the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of $U$ as $\\Phi(z) = P(U \\leq z)$, we have:\n$$P_{f} = P\\left(U \\geq \\frac{R - \\mu_X}{\\sigma_X}\\right) = 1 - \\Phi\\left(\\frac{R - \\mu_X}{\\sigma_X}\\right)$$\nUsing the symmetry property of the standard normal distribution, $1 - \\Phi(z) = \\Phi(-z)$, we can also write:\n$$P_{f} = \\Phi\\left(-\\frac{R - \\mu_X}{\\sigma_X}\\right)$$\n\n**Step 1: Failure Probability in Terms of Safety Margin**\nThe safety margin, $m$, is defined as the expected value of the limit-state function:\n$$m = E[g(X)] = E[R - X] = R - E[X] = R - \\mu_X$$\nSubstituting this definition into the expression for $P_{f}$:\n$$P_{f} = \\Phi\\left(-\\frac{m}{\\sigma_X}\\right)$$\nThis is the closed-form expression for the failure probability in terms of the safety margin $m$ and the standard deviation $\\sigma_X$.\n\n**Step 2: The Hasofer-Lind Reliability Index**\nThe First-Order Reliability Method (FORM) is formulated in the standard normal space (U-space). The limit-state function is transformed as $G(U) = g(\\mu_X + \\sigma_X U) = (R - \\mu_X) - \\sigma_X U$. The failure surface is defined by $G(U) = 0$, which in this one-dimensional case is the point $u^* = (R - \\mu_X) / \\sigma_X$.\nThe Hasofer-Lind reliability index, $\\beta$, is the minimum distance from the origin of the U-space to the failure surface. For this problem, this distance is:\n$$\\beta = |u^*| = \\left|\\frac{R - \\mu_X}{\\sigma_X}\\right|$$\nAssuming a meaningful design where $R > \\mu_X$, we have $\\beta = (R - \\mu_X) / \\sigma_X$.\nBy substituting $\\beta$ into the expression for $P_{f}$, we recast it as:\n$$P_{f} = \\Phi(-\\beta)$$\nThe relationship between the safety margin $m$ and the reliability index $\\beta$ is $\\beta = m / \\sigma_X$. Geometrically, $m$ represents the distance from the mean demand $\\mu_X$ to the resistance $R$ in the original physical space. The index $\\beta$ represents this same distance, but non-dimensionalized by the standard deviation $\\sigma_X$, and corresponds to the distance from the origin to the failure point in the standard normal space.\n\n**Step 3: Derivation of the Safety Factor**\nWe are given a target failure probability $P_{f} = 10^{-3}$. From the relation $P_{f} = \\Phi(-\\beta)$, we can determine the required reliability index $\\beta$:\n$$10^{-3} = \\Phi(-\\beta)$$\nApplying the inverse standard normal CDF, denoted $\\Phi^{-1}$, to both sides:\n$$-\\beta = \\Phi^{-1}(10^{-3})$$\nUsing the symmetry property $\\Phi^{-1}(p) = -\\Phi^{-1}(1-p)$:\n$$\\beta = -\\Phi^{-1}(10^{-3}) = \\Phi^{-1}(1 - 10^{-3})$$\nNext, we express $\\beta$ in terms of the safety factor $n = R / \\mu_X$ and the coefficient of variation $c_{v} = \\sigma_X / \\mu_X$. Assuming $\\mu_X > 0$:\n$$\\beta = \\frac{R - \\mu_X}{\\sigma_X} = \\frac{\\frac{R}{\\mu_X} - 1}{\\frac{\\sigma_X}{\\mu_X}} = \\frac{n - 1}{c_{v}}$$\nBy equating the two expressions for the required $\\beta$, we can solve for $n$:\n$$\\frac{n - 1}{c_{v}} = \\Phi^{-1}(1 - 10^{-3})$$\n$$n - 1 = c_{v} \\Phi^{-1}(1 - 10^{-3})$$\n$$n = 1 + c_{v} \\Phi^{-1}(1 - 10^{-3})$$\nThis is the final analytical expression for the required safety factor $n$ as a function of the coefficient of variation $c_{v}$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{1 + c_{v} \\Phi^{-1}(1 - 10^{-3})}$$", "id": "2680561"}, {"introduction": "Real-world structures are subject to multiple, independent sources of uncertainty.

Since $R$, $P$, and $F$ are statistically independent, the variance of their linear combination is:\n$$\\sigma_{g}^{2} = \\text{Var}[g] = \\text{Var}[R - k_{P} P - k_{F} F] = \\text{Var}[R] + (-k_{P})^{2} \\text{Var}[P] + (-k_{F})^{2} \\text{Var}[F]$$\nSubstituting the given variances, we have:\n$$\\sigma_{g}^{2} = \\sigma_{R}^{2} + k_{P}^{2} \\sigma_{P}^{2} + k_{F}^{2} \\sigma_{F}^{2}$$\nThe standard deviation of $g$ is therefore $\\sigma_{g} = \\sqrt{\\sigma_{R}^{2} + k_{P}^{2} \\sigma_{P}^{2} + k_{F}^{2} \\sigma_{F}^{2}}$.\n\nFor a linear limit-state function involving only\nGaussian random variables, the FORM reliability index $\\beta$ has a simple closed-form expression. The FORM procedure involves transforming the random variables into standard normal space. The limit-state surface $g=0$ becomes a hyperplane in this space. The reliability index $\\beta$ is the minimum distance from the origin to this hyperplane. This distance is given by the ratio of the mean of the limit-state function to its standard deviation.

Thus, $P(F_2) - P(F_1 \\cap F_2) \\ge 0$, and the expression becomes:\n$$P_{f,L} = P(F_1) + P(F_2) - P(F_1 \\cap F_2)$$\nThe upper bound is:\n$$P_{f,U} = P(F_1) + P(F_2) - \\max_{j<2} P(F_2 \\cap F_j) = P(F_1) + P(F_2) - P(F_1 \\cap F_2)$$\nFor a two-component system, the Ditlevsen lower and upper bounds are identical and equal to the exact probability of failure given by the inclusion-exclusion principle. The problem's request for bounds leads to a single, exact value, because the system has only two components.\n\nThe crucial information provided is that the correlation is $\\rho_{12} = 0.0$. Because the variables $Z_1$ and $Z_2$ are jointly normally distributed, zero correlation implies that they are statistically independent.\nTherefore, the joint probability of failure can be calculated as the product of the individual probabilities:\n$$P(F_1 \\cap F_2) = P(F_1)P(F_2) = \\Phi(-\\beta_1)\\Phi(-\\beta_2)$$\nSubstituting this into the exact expression for $P_f$:\n$$P_f = \\Phi(-\\beta_1) + \\Phi(-\\beta_2) - \\Phi(-\\beta_1)\\Phi(-\\beta_2)$$\n\nWe are given the reliability indices $\\beta_1 = 3.0$ and $\\beta_2 = 3.5$. We first compute the individual probabilities of failure:\n$$P_{f,1} = \\Phi(-3.0) \\approx 0.0013499$$\n$$P_{f,2} = \\Phi(-3.5) \\approx 0.00023263$$\nNow, we calculate the system failure probability:\n$$P_f \\approx 0.0013499 + 0.00023263 - (0.0013499 \\times 0.00023263)$$\n$$P_f \\approx 0.00158253 - 3.1404 \\times 10^{-7}$$\n$$P_f \\approx 0.001582216$$\nRounding the result to four significant figures gives $0.001582$. This is the single value for both the lower and upper Ditlevsen bounds.\n\nQualitatively, the series system failure probability $P_f = P(F_1) + P(F_2) - P(F_1 \\cap F_2)$ depends on the correlation $\\rho_{12}$ through the joint probability term $P(F_1 \\cap F_2)$. The individual failure probabilities $P(F_1)$ and $P(F_2)$ are independent of $\\rho_{12}$. The joint probability $P(F_1 \\cap F_2) = P(Z_1 \\ge \\beta_1, Z_2 \\ge \\beta_2)$ for bivariate normal variables is a monotonically increasing function of the correlation $\\rho_{12}$. Consequently, the system failure probability $P_f$ is a monotonically **decreasing** function of $\\rho_{12}$. As correlation increases from $-1$ to $+1$, the failure modes are more likely to occur together. A high positive correlation means that if one mode fails, the other is also very likely to fail. This reduces the total probability of the *union* of failure events, making the system safer. Conversely, negative or zero correlation means the failure modes behave more independently, increasing the chance that at least one of them will occur. For a series system, positive correlation between failure modes is beneficial.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{0.001582}\n$$", "id": "2680563"}]}
