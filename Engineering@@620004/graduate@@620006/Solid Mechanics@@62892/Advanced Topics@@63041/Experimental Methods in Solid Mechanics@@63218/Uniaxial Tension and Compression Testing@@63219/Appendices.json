A solution will be derived.\n\nThe problem is to establish a procedure for calculating engineering and Cauchy stress from experimental measurements and then to derive their ratio.\n\nFirst, we formalize the definitions provided. The initial cross-sectional area, $A_0$, of the cylindrical specimen is given by its initial diameter $d_0$.\n$$A_0 = \\frac{\\pi}{4} d_0^2$$\nThe engineering stress, $\\sigma_{\\mathrm{eng}}(t)$, is defined as the ratio of the applied axial load $P(t)$ to the original area $A_0$.\n$$\\sigma_{\\mathrm{eng}}(t) = \\frac{P(t)}{A_0} = \\frac{P(t)}{\\frac{\\pi}{4} d_0^2}$$\nTo compute $\\sigma_{\\mathrm{eng}}(t)$, one must measure the initial diameter $d_0$ once before the test and measure the load $P(t)$ continuously during the test.\n\nNext, the Cauchy (or true) stress, $\\sigma(t)$, is defined as the ratio of the applied axial load $P(t)$ to the instantaneous cross-sectional area $A(t)$. Assuming the cross-section remains circular, the instantaneous area is a function of the instantaneous diameter $d(t)$.\n$$A(t) = \\frac{\\pi}{4} d(t)^2$$\nTherefore, the Cauchy stress is given by:\n$$\\sigma(t) = \\frac{P(t)}{A(t)} = \\frac{P(t)}{\\frac{\\pi}{4} d(t)^2}$$\nTo compute $\\sigma(t)$, one must measure both the load $P(t)$ and the diameter $d(t)$ continuously and simultaneously throughout the test. This completes the first part of the problem.\n\nThe second part requires the derivation of the ratio $r(t) = \\sigma(t) / \\sigma_{\\mathrm{eng}}(t)$. Using the expressions derived above:\n$$r(t) = \\frac{\\sigma(t)}{\\sigma_{\\mathrm{eng}}(t)} = \\frac{P(t)/A(t)}{P(t)/A_0}$$\nThe applied load $P(t)$ is a common factor in the numerator and denominator, and thus it cancels out, provided $P(t) \\neq 0$.\n$$r(t) = \\frac{A_0}{A(t)}$$\nThis shows that the ratio of true stress to engineering stress is equivalent to the ratio of the initial cross-sectional area to the current cross-sectional area. Now, substituting the expressions for the areas in terms of their respective diameters:\n$$r(t) = \\frac{\\frac{\\pi}{4} d_0^2}{\\frac{\\pi}{4} d(t)^2}$$\nThe constant factor $\\frac{\\pi}{4}$ also cancels. The expression for the ratio $r(t)$ simplifies to a function of only the measurable geometric quantities $d_0$ and $d(t)$, as required.\n$$r(t) = \\left(\\frac{d_0}{d(t)}\\right)^2$$\nThis completes the derivation.\n\nFinally, we must compute the numerical value of this ratio at the specific instant $t^{\\ast}$. The given data are:\n-   Initial diameter, $d_0 = 10.000$ mm.\n-   Instantaneous diameter at time $t^{\\ast}$, $d(t^{\\ast}) = 9.200$ mm.\n\nThe other data, $P(t^{\\ast}) = 52.0$ kN and $L_0 = 50.00$ mm, are not required for the calculation of the dimensionless ratio $r(t^{\\ast})$, as shown by the derived formula.\n\nSubstituting the numerical values into the expression for $r(t^{\\ast})$:\n$$r(t^{\\ast}) = \\left(\\frac{d_0}{d(t^{\\ast})}\\right)^2 = \\left(\\frac{10.000}{9.200}\\right)^2$$\nPerforming the calculation:\n$$r(t^{\\ast}) = \\left(1.0869565...\\right)^2$$\n$$r(t^{\\ast}) = 1.1814641...$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures.\n$$r(t^{\\ast}) \\approx 1.181$$\nThis result is dimensionless, as expected for a ratio of two quantities with the same units (stress).

Green–Lagrange Strain, $E(t)$:\nThe Green–Lagrange strain tensor $\\mathbf{E}$ is defined in terms of the right Cauchy–Green deformation tensor $\\mathbf{C} = \\mathbf{F}^T \\mathbf{F}$. The definition is:\n$$ \\mathbf{E} = \\frac{1}{2}(\\mathbf{C} - \\mathbf{I}) $$\nwhere $\\mathbf{I}$ is the second-order identity tensor.\nFirst, we compute $\\mathbf{C}$:\n$$ \\mathbf{C} = \\mathbf{F}^T \\mathbf{F} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\lambda & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & \\lambda_2 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & \\lambda_3 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} \\lambda & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & \\lambda_2 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & \\lambda_3 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\lambda^2 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & \\lambda_2^2 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & \\lambda_3^2 \\end{pmatrix} $$\nNow, we can find the Green–Lagrange strain tensor:\n$$ \\mathbf{E} = \\frac{1}{2} \\left( \\begin{pmatrix} \\lambda^2 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & \\lambda_2^2 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & \\lambda_3^2 \\end{pmatrix} - \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} \\right) = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{1}{2}(\\lambda^2 - 1) & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & \\frac{1}{2}(\\lambda_2^2 - 1) & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & \\frac{1}{2}(\\lambda_3^2 - 1) \\end{pmatrix} $$\nThe axial component of the Green–Lagrange strain, $E(t)$, is the $(1,1)$ component of this tensor:\n$$ E(t) = E_{11} = \\frac{1}{2}(\\lambda(t)^2 - 1) = \\frac{1}{2}\\left( \\left(\\frac{L(t)}{L_0}\\right)^2 - 1 \\right) $$\n\n2. Logarithmic (Hencky) Strain, $\\varepsilon_{\\text{true}}(t)$:\nThe logarithmic strain is derived from the rate of deformation tensor, $\\mathbf{D}$. The velocity gradient tensor is $\\mathbf{L} = \\dot{\\mathbf{F}}\\mathbf{F}^{-1}$, and the rate of deformation is its symmetric part, $\\mathbf{D} = \\frac{1}{2}(\\mathbf{L} + \\mathbf{L}^T)$.\n$$ \\dot{\\mathbf{F}} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\dot{\\lambda} & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & \\dot{\\lambda}_2 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & \\dot{\\lambda}_3 \\end{pmatrix}, \\quad \\mathbf{F}^{-1} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1/\\lambda & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1/\\lambda_2 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 1/\\lambda_3 \\end{pmatrix} $$\n$$ \\mathbf{L} = \\dot{\\mathbf{F}}\\mathbf{F}^{-1} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\dot{\\lambda}/\\lambda & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & \\dot{\\lambda}_2/\\lambda_2 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & \\dot{\\lambda}_3/\\lambda_3 \\end{pmatrix} $$\nSince $\\mathbf{L}$ is already symmetric for this coaxial deformation, $\\mathbf{D} = \\mathbf{L}$. The axial component of the rate of deformation is $D_{11} = \\dot{\\lambda}/\\lambda$.\nThe logarithmic strain, also known as true strain, is the time integral of the rate of deformation component from the reference state (time $t=0$, where $L=L_0$ and $\\lambda=1$) to the current time $t$.\n$$ \\varepsilon_{\\text{true}}(t) = \\int_{0}^{t} D_{11}(\\tau) \\, d\\tau = \\int_{0}^{t} \\frac{\\dot{\\lambda}(\\tau)}{\\lambda(\\tau)} \\, d\\tau $$\nChanging the integration variable to the stretch $\\lambda'$, since $d\\lambda' = \\dot{\\lambda} d\\tau$:\n$$ \\varepsilon_{\\text{true}}(t) = \\int_{\\lambda(0)}^{\\lambda(t)} \\frac{1}{\\lambda'} \\, d\\lambda' = \\int_{1}^{\\lambda(t)} \\frac{1}{\\lambda'} \\, d\\lambda' = [\\ln(\\lambda')]^{\\lambda(t)}_{1} = \\ln(\\lambda(t)) - \\ln(1) $$\nThis gives the expression for the axial logarithmic strain:\n$$ \\varepsilon_{\\text{true}}(t) = \\ln(\\lambda(t)) = \\ln\\left(\\frac{L(t)}{L_0}\\right) $$\n\nNumerical Calculation of Discrepancy:\nWe are given that at time $t^\\star$, the stretch is $\\lambda(t^\\star) = 1.2$. We compute the values of both strain measures at this instant.\n$$ E(t^\\star) = \\frac{1}{2}((1.2)^2 - 1) = \\frac{1}{2}(1.44 - 1) = \\frac{1}{2}(0.44) = 0.22 $$\n$$ \\varepsilon_{\\text{true}}(t^\\star) = \\ln(1.2) \\approx 0.18232155679 $$\nThe absolute difference $\\delta$ is:\n$$ \\delta = |\\varepsilon_{\\text{true}}(t^\\star) - E(t^\\star)| = |0.18232155679 - 0.22| = |-0.03767844321| = 0.03767844321 $$\nRounding this result to $4$ significant figures gives:\n$$ \\delta \\approx 0.03768 $$\n\nCommentary on Implications:\nThe computed discrepancy, $\\delta \\approx 0.03768$, represents a relative difference of approximately $17\\%$ with respect to the Green-Lagrange strain, and $21\\%$ with respect to the logarithmic strain, for a modest axial stretch of $\\lambda = 1.2$. This difference is significant and grows non-linearly with strain. Both strain measures converge to the engineering strain $\\epsilon = \\lambda-1$ only in the limit of infinitesimal deformation (i.e., as $\\lambda \\to 1$).\nFor constitutive modeling, the choice of strain measure is critical because a conjugate stress measure must be chosen to ensure that the product of stress and strain rate gives the correct power density. For example, the Cauchy (\"true\") stress is work-conjugate to the rate of deformation $\\mathbf{D}$ (from which $\\varepsilon_{\\text{true}}$ is derived), while the second Piola-Kirchhoff stress is work-conjugate to the rate of the Green-Lagrange strain $\\dot{\\mathbf{E}}$.\nIf material parameters, such as hardening coefficients for a metal plasticity model, are determined by fitting a stress-strain curve, using an inconsistent pairing of stress and strain measures will lead to erroneous parameter values. For example, a constitutive relation for true stress as a function of logarithmic strain is common in metal plasticity (e.g., $\\sigma_{\\text{true}} = K(\\varepsilon_{\\text{true}})^n$). If one were to calibrate the parameters $K$ and $n$ using a plot of true stress versus Green-Lagrange strain, the resulting model would be physically incorrect and would yield inaccurate predictions. The calculated discrepancy $\\delta$ quantifies the magnitude of the error in strain representation, which directly propagates into the parameter identification process and subsequent modeling fidelity.

Let us select Step $4$ for the calculation.\nThe givens for Step $4$ are:\nApplied load, $F_4 = 40.0 \\, \\text{kN} = 40.0 \\times 10^3 \\, \\text{N}$.\nMeasured strains, $\\varepsilon_{A,4} = 0.00177778$ and $\\varepsilon_{B,4} = 0.00139683$.\n\nFirst, calculate the average axial strain, $\\varepsilon_{avg,4}$:\n$$\n\\varepsilon_{avg,4} = \\frac{\\varepsilon_{A,4} + \\varepsilon_{B,4}}{2} = \\frac{0.00177778 + 0.00139683}{2} = \\frac{0.00317461}{2} = 0.001587305\n$$\nNext, calculate the nominal axial stress, $\\sigma_4$:\n$$\n\\sigma_4 = \\frac{F_4}{A} = \\frac{40.0 \\times 10^3 \\, \\text{N}}{1.20 \\times 10^{-4} \\, \\text{m}^2} = \\frac{40.0}{1.20} \\times 10^7 \\, \\frac{\\text{N}}{\\text{m}^2} = \\frac{100}{3} \\times 10^7 \\, \\text{Pa} \\approx 3.3333 \\times 10^8 \\, \\text{Pa}\n$$\nNow, we compute the Young's modulus, $E$:\n$$\nE = \\frac{\\sigma_4}{\\varepsilon_{avg,4}} = \\frac{\\frac{100}{3} \\times 10^7 \\, \\text{Pa}}{0.001587305} \\approx 2.0999983 \\times 10^{11} \\, \\text{Pa}\n$$\nThe problem asks for the answer in gigapascals (GPa), where $1 \\, \\text{GPa} = 10^9 \\, \\text{Pa}$.\n$$\nE \\approx 209.99983 \\, \\text{GPa}\n$$\nUpon closer inspection, the strain data corresponds to exact fractions. For instance, in Step $1$, $\\varepsilon_{A,1} = \\frac{4}{9000}$ and $\\varepsilon_{B,1} \\approx \\frac{11}{31500}$, which leads to an average strain $\\varepsilon_{avg,1} = \\frac{1}{2520}$. The load is $F_1 = 10^4 \\, \\text{N}$, giving a stress $\\sigma_1 = \\frac{10^4 \\, \\text{N}}{1.2 \\times 10^{-4} \\, \\text{m}^2} = \\frac{5}{6} \\times 10^8 \\, \\text{Pa}$. The modulus is then exactly:\n$$\nE = \\frac{\\sigma_1}{\\varepsilon_{avg,1}} = \\frac{\\frac{5}{6} \\times 10^8 \\, \\text{Pa}}{\\frac{1}{2520}} = \\frac{5}{6} \\times 2520 \\times 10^8 \\, \\text{Pa} = 5 \\times 420 \\times 10^8 \\, \\text{Pa} = 2100 \\times 10^8 \\, \\text{Pa} = 2.1 \\times 10^{11} \\, \\text{Pa}\n$$\nThis exact result is $E = 210 \\times 10^9 \\, \\text{Pa}$, or $210 \\, \\text{GPa}$.\n\nRounding the final answer to four significant figures as requested, we get $210.0$ GPa.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{210.0}$$", "id": "2708328"}]}
