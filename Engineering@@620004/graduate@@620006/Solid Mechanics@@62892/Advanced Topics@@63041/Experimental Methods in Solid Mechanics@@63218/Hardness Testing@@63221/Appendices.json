The indentation is a spherical cap. The surface area of a spherical cap is given by the formula:\n$$A_c = 2 \\pi R h$$\nwhere $h$ is the depth of the indentation.\n\nThe depth $h$ must be related to the measurable diameter of the impression on the surface, $d$. Consider the geometry of the indentation. A cross-section through the center of the spherical indenter and the center of the circular impression reveals a right-angled triangle. The vertices of this triangle are the center of the sphere, the center of the circular impression, and any point on the circumference of the impression. The hypotenuse of this triangle is the radius of the sphere, $R$. One leg is the radius of the impression, $r = d/2$. The other leg is the distance from the sphere's center to the plane of the impression, which is $R - h$.\n\nBy the Pythagorean theorem:\n$$R^2 = (R-h)^2 + \\left(\\frac{d}{2}\\right)^2$$\nWe solve for the depth $h$:\n$$R^2 = R^2 - 2Rh + h^2 + \\frac{d^2}{4}$$\n$$2Rh - h^2 = \\frac{d^2}{4}$$\nThis is a quadratic equation for $h$.

By definition (i), hardness is the mean contact pressure, which is the maximum applied load divided by the projected contact area at that load, $A_c$.\n$$H = \\frac{P_{\\max}}{A_c}$$\nTo find $H$, we must first determine the projected contact area $A_c$. The area is a function of the contact depth $h_c$, given by $A_c = A(h_c) = 24.5\\,h_c^2$.\n\nNext, we must find the contact depth $h_c$. The problem states to use the definition for a self-similar sharp indenter (ii). The total measured penetration depth $h_{\\max}$ is the sum of the contact depth $h_c$ and the elastic sinking of the surface at the contact perimeter, $h_s$.\n$$h_{\\max} = h_c + h_s$$\nFor a sharp, self-similar indenter (e.g., conical or pyramidal), the surface displacement profile during elastic unloading is such that the sink-in depth $h_s$ is related to the maximum load $P_{\\max}$ and the contact stiffness $S$ by the constant $\\epsilon$:\n$$h_s = \\epsilon \\frac{P_{\\max}}{S}$$\nCombining these two relations yields the expression for the contact depth $h_c$:\n$$h_c = h_{\\max} - h_s = h_{\\max} - \\epsilon \\frac{P_{\\max}}{S}$$\nWith this expression for $h_c$, we can calculate the contact area $A_c$ and subsequently the hardness $H$.\n\nNow, we address the reduced modulus, $E_r$. The problem requires starting from the axisymmetric elastic contact (Sneddon) relation (iii). For a rigid, flat-ended cylindrical punch of radius $a$ indenting an elastic half-space, the relationship between load $P$ and displacement $h$ is $P = 2aE_r h$, which gives a stiffness $S = dP/dh = 2aE_r$.\n\nFor a non-axisymmetric indenter like the Berkovich pyramid, we use the equivalent circular contact assumption, where the contact area $A_c$ is related to an effective radius $a$ by $A_c = \\pi a^2$. This implies $a = \\sqrt{A_c/\\pi}$. Substituting this into the stiffness relation yields:\n$$S = 2 \\sqrt{\\frac{A_c}{\\pi}} E_r = \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{\\pi}} \\sqrt{A_c} E_r$$\nThe problem specifies a correction factor $\\beta$ to account for the non-axisymmetric geometry.

Hardness is defined as the indentation load, $P$, divided by an area. Although Vickers hardness is formally defined using the surface area of the pyramidal impression, in the context of plasticity theory and for relating it to flow stress, it is taken to be a measure of the mean pressure over the projected contact area, $A_p$. The problem states that $HV$ is reported in pressure units, confirming this interpretation.\n$$\np_{m} = \\frac{P}{A_{p}}\n$$\nWe therefore set the mean contact pressure equal to the given hardness value: $p_{m} = HV$.\n\nThe problem states that for a sharp indenter penetrating a plastic material, the mean contact pressure required to maintain plastic flow is significantly higher than the material's uniaxial yield strength. This elevation is due to the geometric constraint imposed by the indenter on the plastic zone, which generates a large hydrostatic stress component. This phenomenon is quantified by the indentation constraint factor, $C$. The relationship is given as:\n$$\np_{m} = C \\sigma_{\\text{rep}}\n$$\nHere, $\\sigma_{\\text{rep}}$ is a representative flow stress of the material under the complex strain field of indentation.
