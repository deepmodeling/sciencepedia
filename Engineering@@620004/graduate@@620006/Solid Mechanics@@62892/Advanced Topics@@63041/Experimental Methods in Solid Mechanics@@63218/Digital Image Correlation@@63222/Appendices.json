Its corresponding point in the reference image, $\\mathbf{p}_0 = (x_0, y_0)$, is given by the pinhole projection equations:\n    $$ x_0 = f \\frac{X_0}{Z_0} \\quad , \\quad y_0 = f \\frac{Y_0}{Z_0} $$\n    From these, we can express the object-space coordinates in terms of the image-space coordinates:\n    $$ X_0 = \\frac{x_0 Z_0}{f} \\quad , \\quad Y_0 = \\frac{y_0 Z_0}{f} $$\n\n2.  **Rigid-Body Rotation:**\n    The specimen undergoes a pure rotation by an angle $\\theta$ about an axis parallel to the camera's $X$-axis and passing through the specimen centroid, which lies at $(0,0,Z_0)$. To find the new coordinates $\\mathbf{P}=(X,Y,Z)$ of the point $\\mathbf{P}_0$, we consider the vector from a point on the axis of rotation, e.g., $(X_0, 0, Z_0)$, to the point $\\mathbf{P}_0$. This vector is $(0, Y_0, 0)$. We rotate this vector by $\\theta$ about the $X$-axis and add it back to the point on the rotation axis.\n    The rotation of vector $(0, Y_0, 0)$ is:\n    $$ \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & \\cos\\theta & -\\sin\\theta \\\\ 0 & \\sin\\theta & \\cos\\theta \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ Y_0 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ Y_0 \\cos\\theta \\\\ Y_0 \\sin\\theta \\end{pmatrix} $$\n    The new position $\\mathbf{P}=(X,Y,Z)$ is found by adding this rotated vector to the point $(X_0, 0, Z_0)$ on the rotation axis:\n    $$ X = X_0 + 0 = X_0 $$\n    $$ Y = 0 + Y_0 \\cos\\theta = Y_0 \\cos\\theta $$\n    $$ Z = Z_0 + Y_0 \\sin\\theta $$\n\n3.  **Deformed Image Coordinates and Mapping:**\n    We now find the new image coordinates $\\mathbf{p}=(x,y)$ by projecting the new 3D point $\\mathbf{P}$ onto the image plane. We first express $X,Y,Z$ in terms of the reference image coordinates $(x_0, y_0)$:\n    $$ X = \\frac{x_0 Z_0}{f} $$\n    $$ Y = \\frac{y_0 Z_0}{f} \\cos\\theta $$\n    $$ Z = Z_0 + \\frac{y_0 Z_0}{f} \\sin\\theta = Z_0 \\left( 1 + \\frac{y_0}{f} \\sin\\theta \\right) $$\n    The new image coordinates $(x,y)$ are:\n    $$ x = f \\frac{X}{Z} = f \\frac{\\frac{x_0 Z_0}{f}}{Z_0 \\left( 1 + \\frac{y_0}{f} \\sin\\theta \\right)} = \\frac{x_0}{1 + \\frac{y_0}{f} \\sin\\theta} $$\n    $$ y = f \\frac{Y}{Z} = f \\frac{\\frac{y_0 Z_0}{f} \\cos\\theta}{Z_0 \\left( 1 + \\frac{y_0}{f} \\sin\\theta \\right)} = \\frac{y_0 \\cos\\theta}{1 + \\frac{y_0}{f} \\sin\\theta} $$\n    This provides the mapping from $(x_0, y_0)$ to $(x, y)$.\n\n4.  **Strain Tensor Calculation:**\n    To find the infinitesimal strain tensor, we first compute the deformation gradient tensor $\\mathbf{F}$ at the image center $(x_0, y_0) = (0, 0)$.\n    $$ \\mathbf{F} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{\\partial x}{\\partial x_0} & \\frac{\\partial x}{\\partial y_0} \\\\ \\frac{\\partial y}{\\partial x_0} & \\frac{\\partial y}{\\partial y_0} \\end{pmatrix} $$\n    The required partial derivatives are:\n    $$ \\frac{\\partial x}{\\partial x_0} = \\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{y_0}{f} \\sin\\theta} $$\n    $$ \\frac{\\partial x}{\\partial y_0} = -\\frac{x_0 \\left( \\frac{1}{f} \\sin\\theta \\right)}{\\left( 1 + \\frac{y_0}{f} \\sin\\theta \\right)^2} $$\n    $$ \\frac{\\partial y}{\\partial x_0} = 0 $$\n    $$ \\frac{\\partial y}{\\partial y_0} = \\frac{\\cos\\theta \\left( 1 + \\frac{y_0}{f} \\sin\\theta \\right) - y_0 \\cos\\theta \\left( \\frac{1}{f} \\sin\\theta \\right)}{\\left( 1 + \\frac{y_0}{f} \\sin\\theta \\right)^2} = \\frac{\\cos\\theta}{\\left( 1 + \\frac{y_0}{f} \\sin\\theta \\right)^2} $$\n    Evaluating these at $(x_0, y_0) = (0, 0)$:\n    $$ \\frac{\\partial x}{\\partial x_0}\\bigg|_{(0,0)} = 1 \\quad , \\quad \\frac{\\partial x}{\\partial y_0}\\bigg|_{(0,0)} = 0 $$\n    $$ \\frac{\\partial y}{\\partial x_0}\\bigg|_{(0,0)} = 0 \\quad , \\quad \\frac{\\partial y}{\\partial y_0}\\bigg|_{(0,0)} = \\cos\\theta $$\n    The deformation gradient tensor at the image center is:\n    $$ \\mathbf{F}\\big|_{(0,0)} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & \\cos\\theta \\end{pmatrix} $$\n    The displacement gradient tensor $\\mathbf{J}$ is $\\mathbf{F} - \\mathbf{I}$, where $\\mathbf{I}$ is the identity matrix.\n    $$ \\mathbf{J}\\big|_{(0,0)} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & \\cos\\theta \\end{pmatrix} - \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & \\cos\\theta - 1 \\end{pmatrix} $$\n    The infinitesimal strain tensor $\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}$ is the symmetric part of $\\mathbf{J}$:\n    $$ \\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon} = \\frac{1}{2} (\\mathbf{J} + \\mathbf{J}^T) = \\frac{1}{2} \\left( \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & \\cos\\theta - 1 \\end{pmatrix} + \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & \\cos\\theta - 1 \\end{pmatrix}^T \\right) = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & \\cos\\theta - 1 \\end{pmatrix} $$\n    From this tensor, we identify the components a $2$D DIC algorithm would report at the center:\n    $$ \\varepsilon_{xx} = 0 $$\n    $$ \\varepsilon_{yy} = \\cos\\theta - 1 $$\n    $$ \\varepsilon_{xy} = 0 $$\n    This non-zero strain $\\varepsilon_{yy}$ is a fictitious strain, an artifact of projecting a $3$D motion onto a $2$D plane.\n\n5.  **Stereo DIC Justification:**\n    Stereo DIC uses two or more cameras to reconstruct the three-dimensional coordinates $(X,Y,Z)$ of the specimen surface in both its reference and deformed states. By tracking the $3$D positions of material points, it directly measures the $3$D displacement field $\\mathbf{U}(\\mathbf{P}_0) = \\mathbf{P} - \\mathbf{P}_0$.\n    The motion described in the problem is a pure rigid-body rotation. By definition, a rigid-body motion preserves the distance between any two points within the body. Therefore, it induces no physical strain.\n    An ideal stereo DIC system, by correctly reconstructing the $3$D geometry, would identify the transformation as a rigid-body motion. The calculation of strain from the reconstructed $3$D field would correctly yield a zero strain tensor everywhere on the specimen. The fictitious strains arise in $2$D DIC precisely because it cannot distinguish between true in-plane deformation and the apparent deformation caused by out-of-plane motion. Stereo DIC is designed specifically to overcome this limitation. Thus, stereo DIC would report zero strain.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 0 & \\cos\\theta - 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}}\n$$", "id": "2630444"}, {"introduction": "An experimental measurement is incomplete without an understanding of its uncertainty.

Applying the variance propagation rule:\n$$\n\\operatorname{Var}(\\varepsilon_{xx}) = \\operatorname{Var}\\left[ \\frac{1}{12h} \\Big( u_{x,i-2,j} - 8u_{x,i-1,j} + 8u_{x,i+1,j} - u_{x,i+2,j} \\Big) \\right]\n$$\n$$\n\\operatorname{Var}(\\varepsilon_{xx}) = \\left(\\frac{1}{12h}\\right)^{2} \\operatorname{Var}\\Big( u_{x,i-2,j} - 8u_{x,i-1,j} + 8u_{x,i+1,j} - u_{x,i+2,j} \\Big)\n$$\n$$\n\\operatorname{Var}(\\varepsilon_{xx}) = \\frac{1}{144h^{2}} \\Big( (1)^{2}\\operatorname{Var}(u_{x,i-2,j}) + (-8)^{2}\\operatorname{Var}(u_{x,i-1,j}) + (8)^{2}\\operatorname{Var}(u_{x,i+1,j}) + (-1)^{2}\\operatorname{Var}(u_{x,i+2,j}) \\Big)\n$$\nSubstituting $\\operatorname{Var}(u_{x}) = \\sigma_{u}^{2}$ for each term:\n$$\n\\operatorname{Var}(\\varepsilon_{xx}) = \\frac{1}{144h^{2}} \\Big( (1+64+64+1)\\sigma_{u}^{2} \\Big) = \\frac{130\\sigma_{u}^{2}}{144h^{2}} = \\frac{65\\sigma_{u}^{2}}{72h^{2}}\n$$\nThe derivation for the normal strain $\\varepsilon_{yy}$ is analogous. The estimate for $\\varepsilon_{yy}$ is:\n$$\n\\varepsilon_{yy}(i,j) \\approx \\frac{1}{12h} \\Big( u_{y}(i,j-2) - 8u_{y}(i,j-1) + 8u_{y}(i,j+1) - u_{y}(i,j+2) \\Big)\n$$\nThis is a linear combination of the measured displacements $u_{y}$ at four distinct grid nodes, which are uncorrelated. The coefficients are identical to the $\\varepsilon_{xx}$ case. Therefore, the variance is the same:\n$$\n\\operatorname{Var}(\\varepsilon_{yy}) = \\frac{1}{144h^{2}} \\Big( (1)^{2}\\operatorname{Var}(u_{y,i,j-2}) + (-8)^{2}\\operatorname{Var}(u_{y,i,j-1}) + (8)^{2}\\operatorname{Var}(u_{y,i,j+1}) + (-1)^{2}\\operatorname{Var}(u_{y,i,j+2}) \\Big)\n$$\n$$\n\\operatorname{Var}(\\varepsilon_{yy}) = \\frac{1}{144h^{2}} \\Big( (1+64+64+1)\\sigma_{u}^{2} \\Big) = \\frac{130\\sigma_{u}^{2}}{144h^{2}} = \\frac{65\\sigma_{u}^{2}}{72h^{2}}\n$$\nFinally, consider the shear strain $\\varepsilon_{xy}$:\n$$\n\\varepsilon_{xy} = \\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\frac{\\partial u_{x}}{\\partial y}+\\frac{\\partial u_{y}}{\\partial x}\\right)\n$$\nIts estimate at node $(i,j)$ is:\n$$\n\\varepsilon_{xy}(i,j) \\approx \\frac{1}{2} \\left( \\frac{u_{x,i,j-2} - 8u_{x,i,j-1} + 8u_{x,i,j+1} - u_{x,i,j+2}}{12h} + \\frac{u_{y,i-2,j} - 8u_{y,i-1,j} + 8u_{y,i+1,j} - u_{y,i+2,j}}{12h} \\right)\n$$\nLet us define the two derivative terms as $D_{u_x, y} = \\frac{\\partial u_{x}}{\\partial y}$ and $D_{u_y, x} = \\frac{\\partial u_{y}}{\\partial x}$. Then $\\varepsilon_{xy} = \\frac{1}{2}(D_{u_x, y} + D_{u_y, x})$. The variance is given by:\n$$\n\\operatorname{Var}(\\varepsilon_{xy}) = \\operatorname{Var}\\left(\\frac{1}{2}(D_{u_x, y} + D_{u_y, x})\\right) = \\frac{1}{4} \\operatorname{Var}(D_{u_x, y} + D_{u_y, x})\n$$\nUsing the rule $\\operatorname{Var}(A+B) = \\operatorname{Var}(A) + \\operatorname{Var}(B) + 2\\operatorname{Cov}(A,B)$:\n$$\n\\operatorname{Var}(\\varepsilon_{xy}) = \\frac{1}{4} \\Big( \\operatorname{Var}(D_{u_x, y}) + \\operatorname{Var}(D_{u_y, x}) + 2\\operatorname{Cov}(D_{u_x, y}, D_{u_y, x}) \\Big)\n$$\nThe variance of each derivative term is calculated as before. For $D_{u_x, y}$:\n$$\n\\operatorname{Var}(D_{u_x, y}) = \\operatorname{Var}\\left(\\frac{1}{12h} \\sum_{k} c_{k} u_{x,k} \\right) = \\frac{1}{144h^{2}} (1^{2}+(-8)^{2}+8^{2}+(-1)^{2})\\sigma_{u}^{2} = \\frac{130\\sigma_{u}^{2}}{144h^{2}} = \\frac{65\\sigma_{u}^{2}}{72h^{2}}\n$$\nSimilarly, for $D_{u_y, x}$:\n$$\n\\operatorname{Var}(D_{u_y, x}) = \\operatorname{Var}\\left(\\frac{1}{12h} \\sum_{l} d_{l} u_{y,l} \\right) = \\frac{1}{144h^{2}} (1^{2}+(-8)^{2}+8^{2}+(-1)^{2})\\sigma_{u}^{2} = \\frac{130\\sigma_{u}^{2}}{144h^{2}} = \\frac{65\\sigma_{u}^{2}}{72h^{2}}\n$$\nNow, we must evaluate the covariance term, $\\operatorname{Cov}(D_{u_x, y}, D_{u_y, x})$. The term $D_{u_x, y}$ is a linear combination of the random variables $\\{u_{x,i,j-2}, u_{x,i,j-1}, u_{x,i,j+1}, u_{x,i,j+2}\\}$. The term $D_{u_y, x}$ is a linear combination of the random variables $\\{u_{y,i-2,j}, u_{y,i-1,j}, u_{y,i+1,j}, u_{y,i+2,j}\\}$. The nodes involved in these two sets are distinct. More importantly, the problem states that the noise is independent between components, meaning $\\operatorname{Cov}(u_x, u_y) = 0$ for any pair of locations. Since $D_{u_x, y}$ depends only on the noise in the $u_x$ field and $D_{u_y, x}$ depends only on the noise in the $u_y$ field, these two quantities are uncorrelated.\n$$\n\\operatorname{Cov}(D_{u_x, y}, D_{u_y, x}) = 0\n$$\nSubstituting these results back into the expression for $\\operatorname{Var}(\\varepsilon_{xy})$:\n$$\n\\operatorname{Var}(\\varepsilon_{xy}) = \\frac{1}{4} \\left( \\frac{65\\sigma_{u}^{2}}{72h^{2}} + \\frac{65\\sigma_{u}^{2}}{72h^{2}} + 0 \\right) = \\frac{1}{4} \\left( 2 \\cdot \\frac{65\\sigma_{u}^{2}}{72h^{2}} \\right) = \\frac{1}{2} \\frac{65\\sigma_{u}^{2}}{72h^{2}} = \\frac{65\\sigma_{u}^{2}}{144h^{2}}\n$$\nThus, the variances of the three strain components are:\n$\\operatorname{Var}(\\varepsilon_{xx}) = \\frac{65\\sigma_{u}^{2}}{72h^{2}}$\n$\\operatorname{Var}(\\varepsilon_{yy}) = \\frac{65\\sigma_{u}^{2}}{72h^{2}}$\n$\\operatorname{Var}(\\varepsilon_{xy}) = \\frac{65\\sigma_{u}^{2}}{144h^{2}}$", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n\\frac{65\\sigma_{u}^{2}}{72h^{2}} & \\frac{65\\sigma_{u}^{2}}{72h^{2}} & \\frac{65\\sigma_{u}^{2}}{144h^{2}}\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "2630488"}]}
