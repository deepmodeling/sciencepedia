Calculate the analytical critical load, $P_{\\text{cr}} = \\pi^2 EI/L^2$.\n9. Compute the relative error for each $n$: $\\epsilon_n = |P_n - P_{\\text{cr}}|/P_{\\text{cr}}$.\n10. Report the resulting list of relative errors, formatted as specified.\n\nThis procedure will demonstrate the convergence of the finite element solution towards the exact analytical solution as the number of elements $n$ increases. As expected from approximation theory for this type of problem, the numerical model is overly stiff, and thus $P_n$ will approach $P_{\\text{cr}}$ from above.", "answer": "```python\n# The complete and runnable Python 3 code goes here.\n# Imports must adhere to the specified execution environment.\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy import linalg\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Computes the relative error of the FEM buckling load for a pinned-pinned column\n    with respect to the analytical Euler buckling load for various mesh densities.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define physical and material constants in SI units\n    E = 210e9  # Young's modulus in Pa\n    I = 8.1e-6  # Second moment of area in m^4\n    L = 2.0  # Length of the column in m\n\n    # Define the test suite for the number of elements\n    test_cases_n = [1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32]\n\n    # Calculate the analytical first critical buckling load (P_cr)\n    P_cr = (np.pi**2 * E * I) / (L**2)\n\n    results = []\n\n    for n in test_cases_n:\n        # Step 1: Define element properties\n        h = L / n  # Length of one element\n\n        # Step 2: Define the element elastic stiffness matrix (ke)\n        # ke = (E*I/h**3) * ...\n        ke_factor = (E * I) / (h**3)\n        ke = ke_factor * np.array([\n            [12, 6 * h, -12, 6 * h],\n            [6 * h, 4 * h**2, -6 * h, 2 * h**2],\n            [-12, -6 * h, 12, -6 * h],\n            [6 * h, 2 * h**2, -6 * h, 4 * h**2]\n        ])\n\n        # Step 3: Define the element geometric stiffness matrix (ge)\n        # ge = (1/(30*h)) * ...\n        ge_factor = 1 / (30 * h)\n        ge = ge_factor * np.array([\n            [36, 3 * h, -36, 3 * h],\n            [3 * h, 4 * h**2, -3 * h, -h**2],\n            [-36, -3 * h, 36, -3 * h],\n            [3 * h, -h**2, -3 * h, 4 * h**2]\n        ])\n        \n        # Step 4: Assemble the global matrices K and G\n        num_nodes = n + 1\n        num_dofs = 2 * num_nodes\n        K = np.zeros((num_dofs, num_dofs))\n        G = np.zeros((num_dofs, num_dofs))\n\n        for i in range(n):\n            # Determine the global DOFs for the current element\n            dof_indices = np.array([2*i, 2*i + 1, 2*(i+1), 2*(i+1) + 1])\n            # Use np.ix_ to facilitate adding the element matrix to the global matrix\n            ix = np.ix_(dof_indices, dof_indices)\n            K[ix] += ke\n            G[ix] += ge\n\n        # Step 5: Apply boundary conditions (pinned-pinned)\n        # We enforce zero transverse displacement at the first and last nodes.\n        # This corresponds to DOF 0 (at node 0) and DOF 2*n (at node n+1).\n        # We remove the corresponding rows and columns from K and G.\n        \n        # DOFs to remove are the displacement DOFs at the ends.\n        # Using 0-based indexing: node 0's displacement is DOF 0.\n        # Node n's displacement is DOF 2*n.\n        dofs_to_remove = [0, 2*n]\n        \n        K_red = np.delete(K, dofs_to_remove, axis=0)\n        K_red = np.delete(K_red, dofs_to_remove, axis=1)\n\n        G_red = np.delete(G, dofs_to_remove, axis=0)\n        G_red = np.delete(G_red, dofs_to_remove, axis=1)\n\n        # Step 6: Solve the generalized eigenvalue problem K_red * v = P * G_red * v\n        # linalg.eigh returns eigenvalues in ascending order.\n        eigenvalues, eigenvectors = linalg.eigh(K_red, G_red)\n        \n        # The smallest positive eigenvalue is the first numerical buckling load, P_n.\n        P_n = eigenvalues[0]\n\n        # Step 7: Calculate the relative error\n        relative_error = abs(P_n - P_cr) / P_cr\n        results.append(relative_error)\n\n    # Final print statement in the exact required format.\n    formatted_results = [f\"{res:.8f}\" for res in results]\n    print(f\"[{','.join(formatted_results)}]\")\n\nsolve()\n```", "id": "2620892"}]}
