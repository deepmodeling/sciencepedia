The problem is well-posed, with all necessary information provided for a unique derivation of the requested quantities. The language is objective and precise. The principles of stationary potential energy for equilibrium and the second variation for stability are fundamental in mechanics. The problem is a standard exercise in nonlinear mechanics and bifurcation theory.\n\n**Verdict:** The problem is valid.

This is expressed by the condition $\\frac{\\partial \\Pi}{\\partial a} = 0$. We compute the partial derivative of $\\Pi$ with respect to $a$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial \\Pi}{\\partial a} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial a} \\left( \\frac{1}{2}\\,\\alpha\\,a^{2} + \\frac{1}{4}\\,\\beta\\,a^{4} - \\lambda\\,a \\right) = \\alpha\\,a + \\beta\\,a^{3} - \\lambda\n$$\nSetting this derivative to zero yields the equilibrium relation between the load $\\lambda$ and the amplitude $a$:\n$$\n\\lambda = \\alpha\\,a + \\beta\\,a^{3}\n$$\nThis equation describes the set of all equilibrium points, known as the equilibrium path, in the $(\\lambda, a)$ space.\n\n**Task 2: Condition for a Limit Point**\nA limit point, or turning point, on the equilibrium path occurs where the load parameter $\\lambda$ reaches a local extremum with respect to the generalized amplitude $a$. At such a point, the tangent to the equilibrium path in the $(a, \\lambda)$ plane is horizontal, meaning $\\frac{d\\lambda}{da} = 0$. Using the equilibrium relation derived in Task 1:\n$$\n\\frac{d\\lambda}{da} = \\frac{d}{da} (\\alpha\\,a + \\beta\\,a^{3}) = \\alpha + 3\\,\\beta\\,a^{2}\n$$\nSetting this derivative to zero gives the amplitude, which we denote $a_{lim}$, at the limit point:\n$$\n\\alpha + 3\\,\\beta\\,a_{lim}^{2} = 0\n$$\nSolving for $a_{lim}^{2}$:\n$$\na_{lim}^{2} = -\\frac{\\alpha}{3\\beta}\n$$\nFor a real-valued solution for $a_{lim}$ to exist, $a_{lim}^{2}$ must be positive. Since the problem statement specifies that $a$ is real and that $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ are non-zero, we must have:\n$$\n-\\frac{\\alpha}{3\\beta} > 0\n$$\nThis inequality is equivalent to $\\frac{\\alpha}{\\beta} < 0$, which implies that $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ must have opposite signs. This is the algebraic condition for the existence of a limit point.\n\n**Task 3: Magnitude of the Limit Load**\nThe limit load, $\\lambda_{lim}$, is the value of the load parameter $\\lambda$ at the amplitude $a_{lim}$. From Task 2, the amplitude at the limit point satisfies $a_{lim} = \\pm\\sqrt{-\\frac{\\alpha}{3\\beta}}$. We substitute this into the equilibrium equation $\\lambda = \\alpha\\,a + \\beta\\,a^{3}$. It is efficient to factor the expression first:\n$$\n\\lambda_{lim} = a_{lim}(\\alpha + \\beta\\,a_{lim}^{2})\n$$\nSubstituting the expression for $a_{lim}^{2}$:\n$$\n\\lambda_{lim} = a_{lim}\\left(\\alpha + \\beta\\left(-\\frac{\\alpha}{3\\beta}\\right)\\right) = a_{lim}\\left(\\alpha - \\frac{\\alpha}{3}\\right) = \\frac{2\\alpha}{3} a_{lim}\n$$\nNow, substituting the expression for $a_{lim}$:\n$$\n\\lambda_{lim} = \\pm \\frac{2\\alpha}{3} \\sqrt{-\\frac{\\alpha}{3\\beta}}\n$$\nThe problem asks for the magnitude of the extremal load, which is $|\\lambda_{lim}|$. We can find this by squaring $\\lambda_{lim}$:\n$$\n\\lambda_{lim}^{2} = \\left(\\frac{2\\alpha}{3} a_{lim}\\right)^{2} = \\frac{4\\alpha^{2}}{9} a_{lim}^{2} = \\frac{4\\alpha^{2}}{9} \\left(-\\frac{\\alpha}{3\\beta}\\right) = -\\frac{4\\alpha^{3}}{27\\beta}\n$$\nThe magnitude is the positive square root of this expression. The expression under the root is guaranteed to be positive because the condition for the existence of the limit point is $\\alpha\\beta < 0$, which ensures that $-\\frac{\\alpha^{3}}{\\beta} = -\\alpha^{2}\\frac{\\alpha}{\\beta} > 0$.\n$$\n|\\lambda_{lim}| = \\sqrt{-\\frac{4\\alpha^{3}}{27\\beta}} = 2\\sqrt{-\\frac{\\alpha^{3}}{27\\beta}}\n$$\nThis is the closed-form expression for the magnitude of the limit load.\n\n**Task 4: Stability of Equilibrium Branches**\nThe stability of an equilibrium configuration is determined by the sign of the second variation of the total potential energy. For a single degree of freedom system, this is the second derivative $\\frac{\\partial^2 \\Pi}{\\partial a^2}$. An equilibrium point is stable if $\\frac{\\partial^2 \\Pi}{\\partial a^2} > 0$ and unstable if $\\frac{\\partial^2 \\Pi}{\\partial a^2} < 0$. The condition $\\frac{\\partial^2 \\Pi}{\\partial a^2} = 0$ signifies a critical point of neutral stability.\nLet's compute the second derivative:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial^2 \\Pi}{\\partial a^2} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial a} \\left(\\alpha\\,a + \\beta\\,a^{3} - \\lambda\\right) = \\alpha + 3\\,\\beta\\,a^{2}\n$$\nWe observe that this is the same expression as for $\\frac{d\\lambda}{da}$. Thus, the stability condition is directly related to the slope of the equilibrium path in the $(a, \\lambda)$ plane:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial^2 \\Pi}{\\partial a^2} = \\frac{d\\lambda}{da}\n$$\nAt the limit point, $\\frac{d\\lambda}{da} = 0$, which means $\\frac{\\partial^2 \\Pi}{\\partial a^2} = 0$, confirming that it is a point of neutral stability. On either side of a limit point, the value of $a$ is different, and thus the sign of $\\frac{d\\lambda}{da}$ is different. Specifically, $\\frac{d\\lambda}{da}$ changes sign as $a$ passes through $a_{lim}$.\nTherefore, one branch of the equilibrium path approaching the limit point is stable ($\\frac{d\\lambda}{da} > 0$), while the other branch departing from it is unstable ($\\frac{d\\lambda}{da} < 0$). The limit point itself marks the boundary between stable and unstable regions on the continuous equilibrium path. This loss of stability at a maximum or minimum load is characteristic of a limit point instability, often called snap-through buckling in structural mechanics.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{2\\sqrt{-\\frac{\\alpha^{3}}{27\\beta}}}\n$$", "id": "2673018"}, {"introduction": "Building upon the foundational one-degree-of-freedom model, we now apply energy methods to analyze the post-buckling behavior of a continuous structure: a compressed square plate.

In reality, as the load increases further into the post-buckling regime, the shape of the deflection $w(x,y)$ changes. Higher-order harmonics of the fundamental mode become non-negligible, typically causing a flattening of the central portion of the plate. This change in shape alters the distribution of membrane and bending strains, meaning the load-deflection path $N_x(A)$ deviates from the simple parabolic form $N_{\\text{cr}} + K A^{2}$. The coefficient $K$ is therefore only a good predictor for deflections that are very small, typically less than the plate thickness $t$.\n2.  **Inadequacy of Simplified Membrane Field**: The problem assumes specific membrane strain expressions ($\\varepsilon_x = \\frac{1}{2} w_x^2$, etc.) which imply zero in-plane displacements $u$ and $v$ throughout the plate. A more rigorous application of von Kármán theory would satisfy the in-plane equilibrium and compatibility equations, typically through the introduction of an Airy stress function. This would reveal a complex, non-uniform membrane stress field that is not simply proportional to local derivatives of $w$. The single-mode approximation for $w$ cannot simultaneously satisfy these additional constraints. This is particularly relevant for clamped boundaries, where strong in-plane restraining stresses develop near the edges to enforce the boundary conditions, a phenomenon not well captured by the assumed simple deflection mode and simplified strain field. The predicted stiffness $K$ is thus an approximation sensitive to the choice of the mode shape and the simplifications made in the membrane energy calculation.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\frac{52}{3}}\n$$", "id": "2672999"}, {"introduction": "While approximate models are invaluable, some classical problems in mechanics permit a full, exact solution, providing deep insight into nonlinear phenomena.

We use the standard derivatives of elliptic integrals: $\\frac{dK}{dk} = \\frac{E(k)-(1-k^2)K(k)}{k(1-k^2)}$ and $\\frac{dE}{dk} = \\frac{E(k)-K(k)}{k}$.\n\nThe derivative of the normalized load is:\n$$\\frac{d\\hat{P}}{dk} = \\frac{8K(k)}{\\pi^2}\\frac{dK}{dk} = \\frac{8K(k)}{\\pi^2} \\frac{E(k)-(1-k^2)K(k)}{k(1-k^2)}$$\nThe derivative of the normalized end-shortening is:\n$$\\frac{d\\hat{\\delta}}{dk} = -2 \\frac{K\\frac{dE}{dk} - E\\frac{dK}{dk}}{K^2} = -\\frac{2}{K^2} \\left( K\\frac{E-K}{k} - E\\frac{E-(1-k^2)K}{k(1-k^2)} \\right)$$\nPutting these over a common denominator simplifies to:\n$$\\frac{d\\hat{\\delta}}{dk} = \\frac{2}{k(1-k^2)K(k)^2} \\left( E(k)^2 - 2(1-k^2)K(k)E(k) + (1-k^2)K(k)^2 \\right)$$\nThe tangent stiffness is the ratio of these two derivatives:\n$$S(k) = \\frac{\\frac{8K(k)}{\\pi^2} \\frac{E(k)-(1-k^2)K(k)}{k(1-k^2)}}{\\frac{2}{k(1-k^2)K(k)^2} \\left( E(k)^2 - 2(1-k^2)K(k)E(k) + (1-k^2)K(k)^2 \\right)}$$\n$$S(k) = \\frac{4K(k)^3}{\\pi^2} \\frac{E(k)-(1-k^2)K(k)}{E(k)^2 - 2(1-k^2)K(k)E(k) + (1-k^2)K(k)^2}$$\nFor stability under end-shortening (displacement) control, the tangent stiffness $S(k) = \\frac{d\\hat{P}}{d\\hat{\\delta}}$ must be positive. An increase in displacement must require an increase in load. We analyze the signs of the derivatives with respect to the parameter $k$.\nFor $k \\in (0, 1)$, it is a known property of elliptic integrals that $E(k) > (1-k^2)K(k)$, which implies $\\frac{dK}{dk} > 0$. Since $K(k)>0$, it follows that $\\frac{d\\hat{P}}{dk} > 0$.\nIt is also a known property that the ratio $E(k)/K(k)$ is a monotonically decreasing function of $k$. Since $\\hat{\\delta}(k) = 2(1 - E(k)/K(k))$, its derivative $\\frac{d\\hat{\\delta}}{dk}$ must be positive for $k \\in (0, 1)$.\nSince both $\\frac{d\\hat{P}}{dk}$ and $\\frac{d\\hat{\\delta}}{dk}$ are positive for all $k \\in (0, 1)$, their ratio, the tangent stiffness $S(k)$, is also positive throughout the post-buckling path.\nTherefore, the entire symmetric first-mode post-buckling branch is stable under end-shortening control.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\frac{4K(k)^3}{\\pi^2} \\frac{E(k)-(1-k^2)K(k)}{E(k)^2 - 2(1-k^2)K(k)E(k) + (1-k^2)K(k)^2}}\n$$", "id": "2673006"}]}
