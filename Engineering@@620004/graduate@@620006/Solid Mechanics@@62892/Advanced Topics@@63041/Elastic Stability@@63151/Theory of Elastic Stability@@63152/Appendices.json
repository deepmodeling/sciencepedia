It presents a standard, solvable problem in structural mechanics. Therefore, the problem is **valid**. I will proceed to derive the solution.\n\n**Derivation of the Governing Equation**\nWe begin by establishing the balance of moments on a differential element of the column. A free-body diagram of a segment of the column from one end to a position $x$ shows that the internal bending moment $M(x)$ must balance the external moment created by the axial force $P$ acting on the lever arm given by the total lateral deflection $y(x)$. With a standard sign convention where a positive moment causes positive curvature (concave up), the equilibrium equation is:\n$$M(x) + P y(x) = 0$$\nThe problem provides the constitutive relation for an initially curved beam under the small deflection approximation:\n$$M(x) = EI \\left( y''(x) - y_0''(x) \\right)$$\nSubstituting the constitutive relation into the moment equilibrium equation yields the governing ordinary differential equation (ODE) for the total deflection $y(x)$:\n$$EI \\left( y''(x) - y_0''(x) \\right) + P y(x) = 0$$\nThis can be rearranged into a standard form:\n$$EI y''(x) + P y(x) = EI y_0''(x)$$\n\n**Solution of the Governing Equation**\nThe initial out-of-straightness is given as $y_0(x) = \\delta \\sin(\\pi x/L)$. We must find its second derivative, which represents the initial curvature contribution:\n$$y_0'(x) = \\delta \\frac{\\pi}{L} \\cos\\left(\\frac{\\pi x}{L}\\right)$$\n$$y_0''(x) = -\\delta \\left(\\frac{\\pi}{L}\\right)^2 \\sin\\left(\\frac{\\pi x}{L}\\right)$$\nSubstituting this into the right-hand side of the governing ODE gives:\n$$EI y''(x) + P y(x) = -EI \\delta \\left(\\frac{\\pi}{L}\\right)^2 \\sin\\left(\\frac{\\pi x}{L}\\right)$$\nDividing by $EI$, we obtain:\n$$y''(x) + \\frac{P}{EI} y(x) = -\\delta \\left(\\frac{\\pi}{L}\\right)^2 \\sin\\left(\\frac{\\pi x}{L}\\right)$$\nThis is a second-order linear non-homogeneous ODE. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution $y_h(x)$ and a particular solution $y_p(x)$.\nThe homogeneous equation is $y_h'' + (P/EI) y_h = 0$.\nThe particular solution can be found by the method of undetermined coefficients. Given the form of the right-hand side, we assume a particular solution of the form $y_p(x) = A \\sin(\\pi x/L)$. Its second derivative is $y_p''(x) = -A (\\pi/L)^2 \\sin(\\pi x/L)$. Substituting $y_p$ and $y_p''$ into the non-homogeneous ODE:\n$$-A \\left(\\frac{\\pi}{L}\\right)^2 \\sin\\left(\\frac{\\pi x}{L}\\right) + \\frac{P}{EI} A \\sin\\left(\\frac{\\pi x}{L}\\right) = -\\delta \\left(\\frac{\\pi}{L}\\right)^2 \\sin\\left(\\frac{\\pi x}{L}\\right)$$\nFor this equation to hold for all $x$, the coefficients of $\\sin(\\pi x/L)$ must be equal:\n$$A \\left( \\frac{P}{EI} - \\left(\\frac{\\pi}{L}\\right)^2 \\right) = -\\delta \\left(\\frac{\\pi}{L}\\right)^2$$\nSolving for the amplitude $A$:\n$$A = \\frac{-\\delta (\\pi/L)^2}{P/EI - (\\pi/L)^2}$$\nWe introduce the Euler critical load for a perfect pinned-pinned column, $P_{\\mathrm{cr}}$, which corresponds to the first buckling mode. This is the smallest non-zero load for which the perfect column has a non-trivial solution. It is known to be $P_{\\mathrm{cr}} = \\frac{\\pi^2 EI}{L^2}$. Using this definition, we can rewrite the expression for $A$ by factoring $(\\pi/L)^2$ from the denominator:\n$$A = \\frac{-\\delta (\\pi/L)^2}{(\\pi/L)^2 \\left( \\frac{P}{EI(\\pi/L)^2} - 1 \\right)} = \\frac{-\\delta}{\\frac{P}{\\pi^2 EI / L^2} - 1} = \\frac{-\\delta}{P/P_{\\mathrm{cr}} - 1}$$\n$$A = \\frac{\\delta}{1 - P/P_{\\mathrm{cr}}}$$\nThis result is valid for $P \\neq P_{\\mathrm{cr}}$. The particular solution is:\n$$y_p(x) = \\frac{\\delta}{1-P/P_{\\mathrm{cr}}} \\sin\\left(\\frac{\\pi x}{L}\\right)$$\nThe general solution is $y(x) = C_1 \\cos(kx) + C_2 \\sin(kx) + y_p(x)$, where $k=\\sqrt{P/EI}$. Applying the boundary conditions $y(0)=0$ and $y(L)=0$:\n$y(0) = C_1 \\cos(0) + C_2 \\sin(0) + y_p(0) = C_1 + 0 + 0 = 0 \\implies C_1 = 0$.\n$y(L) = C_2 \\sin(kL) + y_p(L) = C_2 \\sin(kL) + \\frac{\\delta}{1-P/P_{\\mathrm{cr}}} \\sin(\\pi) = C_2 \\sin(kL) = 0$.\nFor the prebuckled state where $P  P_{\\mathrm{cr}}$, we have $kL = \\sqrt{P/EI}L = \\pi\\sqrt{P/P_{\\mathrm{cr}}}  \\pi$. For $P0$, $\\sin(kL) \\neq 0$. Therefore, we must have $C_2 = 0$.\nThe homogeneous part of the solution is zero. The total deflection is simply the particular solution:\n$$y(x) = \\frac{\\delta}{1-P/P_{\\mathrm{cr}}} \\sin\\left(\\frac{\\pi x}{L}\\right)$$\n\n**Analysis of Results**\n1.  **Prebuckled Deflection**: The deflection $y(x)$ maintains the same sinusoidal shape as the initial imperfection $y_0(x)$. Its amplitude, however, is magnified by the factor $1/(1-P/P_{\\mathrm{cr}})$. This factor is often called the amplification factor. As the compressive load $P$ approaches the Euler critical load $P_{\\mathrm{cr}}$, this factor grows, and thus the deflection grows.\n2.  **Effective Critical Load**: The problem defines the effective critical load $P_{\\mathrm{eff}}$ as the load at which the deflection amplitude becomes unbounded. The amplitude of our derived solution is $\\frac{\\delta}{1 - P/P_{\\mathrm{cr}}}$. This expression tends to infinity as the denominator approaches zero, which occurs when $1 - P/P_{\\mathrm{cr}} \\to 0$, or $P \\to P_{\\mathrm{cr}}$. Therefore, the effective critical load for this linearized model is $P_{\\mathrm{eff}} = P_{\\mathrm{cr}}$. The initial imperfection does not change the theoretical load at which failure by buckling occurs, but it causes deflections to grow progressively with the load, unlike the perfect column which exhibits bifurcation.\n\n**Evaluation of Options**\n\n*   **Option A**: \"The prebuckled deflection remains in the same sinusoidal mode as the initial curvature and is amplified by the geometric stiffness reduction: $y(x)=\\dfrac{\\delta}{1-P/P_{\\mathrm{cr}}}\\,\\sin\\!\\big(\\pi x/L\\big)$ for $PP_{\\mathrm{cr}}$, and the effective critical load is unchanged from the Euler value $P_{\\mathrm{cr}}$ of the perfect pinned column.\"\n    This statement perfectly matches our derived solution for $y(x)$ and our conclusion about the effective critical load $P_{\\mathrm{eff}} = P_{\\mathrm{cr}}$. The phrase \"amplified by the geometric stiffness reduction\" correctly interprets the physical meaning of the $Py$ term in the governing equation, which acts to reduce the system's resistance to bending.\n    Verdict: **Correct**.\n\n*   **Option B**: \"The prebuckled deflection is $y(x)=\\dfrac{\\delta}{1+P/P_{\\mathrm{cr}}}\\,\\sin\\!\\big(\\pi x/L\\big)$, and the effective critical load is reduced to $P_{\\mathrm{eff}}=P_{\\mathrm{cr}}\\big(1-(\\pi \\delta/L)^2\\big)$ at leading order.\"\n    The deflection formula has a denominator of $1+P/P_{\\mathrm{cr}}$, which implies deflection decreases with increasing compressive load. This is physically incorrect and contradicts our derivation. The conclusion about a reduced effective critical load is also false within the context of this linear model.\n    Verdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n*   **Option C**: \"The prebuckled deflection exhibits mode coupling with a higher harmonic, $y(x)=\\delta\\,\\sin\\!\\big(\\pi x/L\\big)+\\mathcal{O}(P/EI)\\,\\sin\\!\\big(2\\pi x/L\\big)$, while the effective critical load remains equal to $P_{\\mathrm{cr}}$.\"\n    Our solution shows that if the initial imperfection is a single sine mode, the resulting deflection in the linear theory is also purely that same sine mode. No higher harmonics are generated. This statement is therefore incorrect about the shape of the deflection.\n    Verdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n*   **Option D**: \"The prebuckled deflection amplitude decreases with $P$ according to $y(x)=\\dfrac{\\delta\\,(\\pi^2/L^2)}{(\\pi^2/L^2)+P/(E I)}\\,\\sin\\!\\big(\\pi x/L\\big)$, and the effective critical load increases above $P_{\\mathrm{cr}}$ due to initial curvature.\"\n    The deflection formula provided here is equivalent to that in Option B, as shown by algebraic manipulation: $\\frac{\\delta\\,(\\pi^2/L^2)}{(\\pi^2/L^2)+P/(E I)} = \\frac{\\delta}{1 + P/(EI(\\pi/L)^2)} = \\frac{\\delta}{1+P/P_{\\mathrm{cr}}}$.

Choose an admissible trial function $w_{C}(x,y)$ that exactly enforces $w=0$ and the vanishing normal slope on $x=0$, $x=a$, $y=0$, and $y=b$, and evaluate all integrals in closed form to obtain a Rayleigh quotient for $N_{x,\\mathrm{cr}}$.\n\n2) Repeat the derivation for a plate that is simply supported on all edges, using a single-parameter Rayleigh–Ritz approximation with a trial function $w_{S}(x,y)$ that satisfies $w=0$ and vanishing bending moment on the boundaries. Evaluate all integrals and obtain a Rayleigh quotient for $N_{x,\\mathrm{cr}}$ for the simply supported case.\n\n3) Introduce the non-dimensional buckling coefficient\n$$\nK_{x} \\equiv \\dfrac{N_{x,\\mathrm{cr}}\\,b^{2}}{D\\,\\pi^{2}},\n$$\nand let $\\beta \\equiv \\dfrac{a}{b}$. Denote by $K_{x}^{(C)}(\\beta,\\eta)$ and $K_{x}^{(S)}(\\beta,\\eta)$ the coefficients for the clamped and simply supported plates obtained from parts $1)$ and $2)$, respectively. For a square plate under equal biaxial compression, i.e., $\\beta = 1$ and $\\eta = 1$, compute the ratio\n$$\nR \\equiv \\dfrac{K_{x}^{(C)}(1,1)}{K_{x}^{(S)}(1,1)}.\n$$\n\nGive your final answer as an exact rational number with no units.

It represents a standard exercise in the theory of elastic stability of plates. We proceed with the solution.\n\nThe total potential energy of the system is given by $\\Pi = U_{b} - W$, where $U_{b}$ is the bending strain energy and $W$ is the potential of the in-plane forces (work done by the external forces). At the critical buckling load, the second variation of the total potential energy vanishes. For a single-parameter Rayleigh–Ritz approximation, this corresponds to finding the load for which the equilibrium of the deflected plate is neutral. The critical load, $N_{x,\\mathrm{cr}}$, is found using the Rayleigh quotient, which for this problem takes the form $N_{x,\\mathrm{cr}} = U_{b} / (W / N_{x})$.\n\nWe must evaluate the integrals of the given energy functionals for the two specified boundary conditions using appropriate trial functions.\n\n**Part 1: Clamped Plate**\n\nFor a plate clamped on all four edges ($x=0$, $x=a$, $y=0$, $y=b$), the deflection $w(x,y)$ must satisfy $w=0$ and the normal slope $\\partial w/\\partial n = 0$ on the boundary.
