Provide the answer in Pascals. The final answer must be a single closed-form analytic expression.", "solution": "The problem is well-posed and grounded in the classical theory of elastic stability. We shall proceed with its solution.\n\nThe starting point for the linear stability analysis is the Föppl–von Kármán (FvK) equation for the out-of-plane deflection $w(x,y)$ of a thin plate under in-plane loading. The linearized form of this equation is:\n$$ D \\nabla^4 w = N_{xx} \\frac{\\partial^2 w}{\\partial x^2} + 2 N_{xy} \\frac{\\partial^2 w}{\\partial x \\partial y} + N_{yy} \\frac{\\partial^2 w}{\\partial y^2} $$\nwhere $D$ is the bending stiffness and $N_{ij}$ are the membrane force resultants per unit length.\n\nAccording to the problem statement, the sheet is subjected to a uniform in-plane compressive force resultant per unit length, $N > 0$, directed along the $y$-axis. This corresponds to a stress state where the only non-zero component of the force resultant tensor is $N_{yy}$. For compression, this force opposes the increase in displacement gradient, so its contribution to the potential energy leads to a term in the equilibrium equation of the form $-N \\frac{\\partial^2 w}{\\partial y^2}$. Thus, we have $N_{yy} = -N$, and $N_{xx} = N_{xy} = 0$. The governing equation becomes:\n$$ D \\nabla^4 w = -N \\frac{\\partial^2 w}{\\partial y^2} $$\n\nThe problem specifies that we analyze perturbations that are independent of the $x$-coordinate, meaning $w(x,y) = w(y)$. Consequently, all partial derivatives with respect to $x$ are zero. The biharmonic operator $\\nabla^4 = \\left( \\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial x^2} + \\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial y^2} \\right)^2$ simplifies to $\\frac{d^4}{dy^4}$. The governing partial differential equation reduces to a linear, homogeneous ordinary differential equation (ODE):\n$$ D \\frac{d^4 w}{dy^4} + N \\frac{d^2 w}{dy^2} = 0 $$\nThis equation describes the buckling behavior of the sheet for modes that vary only across its width $W$.\n\nThe boundary conditions are given at the edges $y=0$ and $y=W$. These edges are \"simply supported\". In thin plate theory, this implies two conditions at each edge:\n1.  The out-of-plane deflection is zero: $w(0) = 0$ and $w(W) = 0$.\n2.  The bending moment about an axis parallel to the edge is zero. For the edges at $y=0$ and $y=W$, this is the bending moment $M_{yy}$. The constitutive relation for this moment is $M_{yy} = -D \\left( \\frac{\\partial^2 w}{\\partial y^2} + \\nu \\frac{\\partial^2 w}{\\partial x^2} \\right)$. Since $w=w(y)$, this simplifies to $M_{yy} = -D \\frac{d^2 w}{dy^2}$. The boundary condition is therefore $\\frac{d^2 w}{dy^2} = 0$ at $y=0$ and $y=W$.\n\nWe now solve the ODE subject to these four boundary conditions. Let us define a parameter $k^2 = N/D$, which must be positive since $N > 0$ and $D > 0$. The ODE is:\n$$ \\frac{d^4 w}{dy^4} + k^2 \\frac{d^2 w}{dy^2} = 0 $$\nThis is a constant-coefficient ODE. Its characteristic equation is $r^4 + k^2 r^2 = 0$, or $r^2(r^2 + k^2) = 0$. The roots are $r_1=r_2=0$, and $r_3, r_4 = \\pm i k$. The general solution for $w(y)$ is:\n$$ w(y) = C_1 \\cos(ky) + C_2 \\sin(ky) + C_3 y + C_4 $$\nwhere $C_1, C_2, C_3, C_4$ are integration constants. We apply the boundary conditions to find these constants.\nThe second derivative is $w''(y) = -C_1 k^2 \\cos(ky) - C_2 k^2 \\sin(ky)$.\n\nAt $y=0$:\n1.  $w(0) = 0 \\implies C_1 + C_4 = 0$.\n2.  $w''(0) = 0 \\implies -C_1 k^2 = 0$. Since we seek a buckling solution where $N>0$, it follows that $k^2 > 0$, so $k \\neq 0$. Thus, we must have $C_1 = 0$. From the first condition, this implies $C_4=0$.\n\nThe solution simplifies to $w(y) = C_2 \\sin(ky) + C_3 y$. Now we apply the boundary conditions at $y=W$:\n3.  $w(W) = 0 \\implies C_2 \\sin(kW) + C_3 W = 0$.\n4.  $w''(W) = 0 \\implies -C_2 k^2 \\sin(kW) = 0$.\n\nFrom the fourth condition, since $k \\neq 0$, we have either $C_2 = 0$ or $\\sin(kW) = 0$. If $C_2 = 0$, the third condition becomes $C_3 W = 0$, which implies $C_3=0$ because $W>0$. This leads to the trivial solution $w(y)=0$, which corresponds to the unbuckled state. For a non-trivial buckling mode to exist, we must have at least one non-zero coefficient, which requires $\\sin(kW) = 0$.\n\nThe condition $\\sin(kW) = 0$ implies that $kW$ must be an integer multiple of $\\pi$:\n$$ kW = n\\pi, \\quad \\text{for } n \\in \\mathbb{Z} $$\nSince $k = \\sqrt{N/D} > 0$ and $W > 0$, $n$ must be a positive integer, $n \\in \\mathbb{N} = \\{1, 2, 3, \\dots\\}$. This quantizes the possible values of the wavenumber $k$:\n$$ k_n = \\frac{n\\pi}{W} $$\nThese are the discrete transverse wrinkle wavenumbers selected by the boundary conditions.\n\nNow, substituting $\\sin(k_n W) = \\sin(n\\pi) = 0$ back into the third boundary condition, $C_2 \\sin(k_n W) + C_3 W = 0$, we get $C_3 W = 0$, which yields $C_3 = 0$.\nSo for a non-trivial solution, we must have $C_1=C_3=C_4=0$ and $C_2 \\neq 0$. The resulting buckling modes, or eigenfunctions, are:\n$$ w_n(y) = C_n \\sin(k_n y) = C_n \\sin\\left(\\frac{n\\pi y}{W}\\right) $$\nwhere $C_n$ is the arbitrary amplitude of the $n$-th mode.\n\nThe buckling occurs at specific values of the compressive load $N$, which we can now determine. From the definition $k^2 = N/D$, we have a discrete set of buckling loads $N_n$ corresponding to each mode $n$:\n$$ N_n = D k_n^2 = D \\left(\\frac{n\\pi}{W}\\right)^2 $$\nThe problem asks for the critical compressive Cauchy stress, $\\sigma_c(n)$, as a function of the mode number $n$. The force resultant $N$ is related to the uniform stress $\\sigma$ by $N = \\sigma h$. Thus, the buckling stress for mode $n$ is $\\sigma_n = N_n / h$.\n$$ \\sigma_c(n) = \\frac{N_n}{h} = \\frac{D}{h} \\left(\\frac{n\\pi}{W}\\right)^2 $$\nFinally, we substitute the given expression for the bending stiffness, $D = \\frac{E h^3}{12(1-\\nu^2)}$:\n$$ \\sigma_c(n) = \\frac{1}{h} \\left( \\frac{E h^3}{12(1-\\nu^2)} \\right) \\left(\\frac{n\\pi}{W}\\right)^2 $$\nSimplifying this expression gives the final result for the buckling stress as a function of the mode number $n$:\n$$ \\sigma_c(n) = \\frac{E h^2}{12(1-\\nu^2)} \\frac{n^2 \\pi^2}{W^2} $$\nThis can be rewritten to group the terms as follows:\n$$ \\sigma_c(n) = \\frac{\\pi^2 E}{12(1-\\nu^2)} \\left(\\frac{h}{W}\\right)^2 n^2 $$\nThe lowest, and therefore physically most critical, buckling stress occurs for the smallest possible value of $n$, which is $n=1$.

All premises are based on established principles of continuum mechanics and plate theory (Föppl–von Kármán framework). The problem is self-contained, consistent, and well-posed. Thus, it is deemed valid, and a solution is pursued.\n\nPart 1: Qualitative Explanation\n\nThe stability of the flat sheet is determined by the interplay between the stabilizing bending energy and the membrane energy associated with the in-plane pre-stress. A wrinkling instability occurs when a periodic out-of-plane displacement can lower the total potential energy of the system. This is possible only if the membrane energy contribution is negative, which requires the presence of a compressive stress.\n\nWe begin by analyzing the given in-plane stress resultant state. The stress resultant tensor $\\boldsymbol{N}$ is given by:\n$$\n\\boldsymbol{N} = \\begin{pmatrix} N_{xx} & N_{xy} \\\\ N_{yx} & N_{yy} \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & S \\\\ S & 0 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nTo understand the nature of this stress state, we find its principal stresses (eigenvalues) and principal directions (eigenvectors). The characteristic equation is $\\det(\\boldsymbol{N} - \\lambda \\boldsymbol{I}) = 0$:\n$$\n\\det\\begin{pmatrix} -\\lambda & S \\\\ S & -\\lambda \\end{pmatrix} = (-\\lambda)(-\\lambda) - (S)(S) = \\lambda^2 - S^2 = 0\n$$\nThe principal stress resultants are $\\lambda_{1} = S$ and $\\lambda_{2} = -S$. Since $S>0$, $\\lambda_1$ is a tensile stress and $\\lambda_2$ is a compressive stress.\n\nThe principal directions are found from the eigenvectors.\nFor the tensile stress $\\lambda_{1} = S$:\n$$\n(\\boldsymbol{N} - S \\boldsymbol{I})\\boldsymbol{v} = 0 \\implies \\begin{pmatrix} -S & S \\\\ S & -S \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} v_x \\\\ v_y \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\implies -S v_x + S v_y = 0 \\implies v_x = v_y\n$$\nThe eigenvector is proportional to $(1, 1)$, which corresponds to a direction at an angle of $\\theta = \\arctan(1/1) = \\pi/4$ radians, or $45^\\circ$, with respect to the $x$-axis.\n\nFor the compressive stress $\\lambda_{2} = -S$:\n$$\n(\\boldsymbol{N} + S \\boldsymbol{I})\\boldsymbol{v} = 0 \\implies \\begin{pmatrix} S & S \\\\ S & S \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} v_x \\\\ v_y \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\implies S v_x + S v_y = 0 \\implies v_x = -v_y\n$$\nThe eigenvector is proportional to $(1, -1)$, which corresponds to a direction at an angle of $\\theta = \\arctan(-1/1) = -\\pi/4$ radians, or $-45^\\circ$, with respect to the $x$-axis.\n\nThus, the state of pure shear is equivalent to a tensile stress of magnitude $S$ acting along the $+45^\\circ$ direction and a compressive stress of magnitude $S$ acting along the $-45^\\circ$ direction.\n\nThe variational formulation for the potential energy $\\mathcal{E}$ of a pre-stressed plate involves a positive-definite bending energy term, $\\mathcal{U}_B \\propto \\int B (\\nabla^2 w)^2 dA$, and a membrane energy term, $\\mathcal{U}_M \\propto \\int (N_{ij} w_{,i} w_{,j}) dA$. Wrinkling instability is driven by the compressive component of the pre-stress, which can lead to a negative membrane energy contribution ($\\mathcal{U}_M < 0$) that overcomes the stabilizing bending energy. The system seeks to form wrinkles in a direction that maximally relieves the compressive stress. For a wrinkle pattern characterized by a wavevector $\\boldsymbol{k}$, the energy is minimized when $\\boldsymbol{k}$ is aligned with the direction of principal compression. In this case, the direction of principal compression is $-45^\\circ$. Therefore, the most energetically favorable wrinkle pattern will have its wavevector $\\boldsymbol{k}$ oriented at an angle of $-45^\\circ$. The reference to \"$\\pm 45^\\circ$\" in the problem description is understood to identify the two principal axes generic to a pure shear state, with the compressive one being responsible for the instability.\n\nPart 2: Linear Stability Analysis\n\nThe governing equation of motion for the out-of-plane displacement $w(x,y,t)$ of a thin plate with pre-stress, inertia, and damping is:\n$$\n\\rho h \\frac{\\partial^2 w}{\\partial t^2} + c \\frac{\\partial w}{\\partial t} + B \\nabla^4 w = N_{xx} \\frac{\\partial^2 w}{\\partial x^2} + N_{yy} \\frac{\\partial^2 w}{\\partial y^2} + 2 N_{xy} \\frac{\\partial^2 w}{\\partial x \\partial y}\n$$\nSubstituting the given stress resultants ($N_{xx}=0$, $N_{yy}=0$, $N_{xy}=S$):\n$$\n\\rho h \\frac{\\partial^2 w}{\\partial t^2} + c \\frac{\\partial w}{\\partial t} + B \\nabla^4 w = 2S \\frac{\\partial^2 w}{\\partial x \\partial y}\n$$\nWe seek a solution in the form of a normal mode:\n$$\nw(x,y,t) = \\Re\\{A \\exp(\\sigma t + i\\,\\boldsymbol{k}\\cdot\\boldsymbol{x})\\}\n$$\nwhere $\\boldsymbol{k} = (k_x, k_y) = (k\\cos\\theta, k\\sin\\theta)$ is the wavevector and $\\sigma$ is the complex growth rate. Substituting this form into the governing equation yields the following derivatives:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t} \\to \\sigma, \\quad \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} \\to i k_x, \\quad \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y} \\to i k_y, \\quad \\nabla^2 \\to -(k_x^2+k_y^2) = -k^2, \\quad \\nabla^4 \\to k^4\n$$\nThe partial differential equation transforms into an algebraic equation for $\\sigma$:\n$$\n\\rho h \\sigma^2 w + c \\sigma w + B k^4 w = 2S (i k_x)(i k_y) w\n$$\nDividing by $w$ (for a non-trivial solution) and simplifying the right-hand side:\n$$\n\\rho h \\sigma^2 + c \\sigma + B k^4 = -2S k_x k_y\n$$\nSubstituting $k_x = k\\cos\\theta$ and $k_y = k\\sin\\theta$:\n$$\n\\rho h \\sigma^2 + c \\sigma + B k^4 = -2S (k\\cos\\theta)(k\\sin\\theta) = -S k^2 (2\\sin\\theta\\cos\\theta) = -S k^2 \\sin(2\\theta)\n$$\nThis gives the dispersion relation as a quadratic equation for $\\sigma$:\n$$\n\\rho h \\sigma^2 + c \\sigma + (B k^4 + S k^2 \\sin(2\\theta)) = 0\n$$\nThe solutions for $\\sigma$ are given by the quadratic formula:\n$$\n\\sigma = \\frac{-c \\pm \\sqrt{c^2 - 4\\rho h (B k^4 + S k^2 \\sin(2\\theta))}}{2 \\rho h}\n$$\nAn instability corresponds to a positive real part of the growth rate, $\\Re(\\sigma) > 0$. If the discriminant $c^2 - 4\\rho h (B k^4 + S k^2 \\sin(2\\theta))$ is negative, the roots are complex conjugates with real part $\\Re(\\sigma) = -c/(2\\rho h) \\le 0$, which signifies damped oscillations. Thus, for an instability to occur, the discriminant must be non-negative, and the growth rate must be positive. We take the '$+$' sign for the largest possible growth rate:\n$$\n\\sigma = \\frac{-c + \\sqrt{c^2 - 4\\rho h (B k^4 + S k^2 \\sin(2\\theta))}}{2 \\rho h}\n$$\nTo maximize the growth rate $\\sigma$ for a given wavenumber $k$, we must maximize the argument of the square root. This is equivalent to minimizing the term $B k^4 + S k^2 \\sin(2\\theta)$ with respect to the angle $\\theta$.
