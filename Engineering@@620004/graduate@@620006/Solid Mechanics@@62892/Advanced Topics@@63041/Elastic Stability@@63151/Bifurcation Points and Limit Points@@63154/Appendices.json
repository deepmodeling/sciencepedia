At this point, the system is at the brink of instability. Under dead loading, the load $\\Lambda$ is maintained at $\\Lambda_{L1}$, and the system dynamically jumps to the other available stable equilibrium state at this same load.\nThe Maxwell load $\\Lambda_M = 0$ is the load at which the two stable equilibrium \"wells\" have equal potential energy. For any load $\\Lambda > \\Lambda_M$, the $-\\Lambda q$ term in the potential energy expression biases the system, lowering the energy of the well at positive $q$ and raising the energy of the well at negative $q$.\nSince snap-through occurs at $\\Lambda_{L1} = \\frac{2\\sqrt{3}}{9} > 0 = \\Lambda_M$, the jump is from a higher-energy state (the pre-snap equilibrium in the left well) to a lower-energy state (the post-snap equilibrium in the right well). This transition involves a net decrease in the total potential energy of the system, $\\Delta\\Pi < 0$. The released energy is dissipated, typically through viscous damping or emission of stress waves. Therefore, the snap-through is dissipative.\n\nThe final answer requires the ordered pair $(\\Lambda_M, \\Lambda_{L1})$.

This implies that the cross-term coefficient in $\\Pi_2$ must vanish at the critical load:\n$$ k_{12}^{(b)} - N_{\\text{cr}} k_{12}^{(g)} = 0 $$\nAlthough not immediately obvious from the functional forms of $\\psi_1$ and $\\psi_2$, this condition is required for the problem's procedural instruction to be consistent. We must proceed assuming this orthogonality condition holds, as it is implicitly demanded by the problem's structure.\n\nThe quartic part of the energy, $\\Pi_4$, derives from the membrane energy $U_m$. It can be written as a homogeneous quartic polynomial:\n$$ \\Pi_4(A,B) = \\frac{1}{4}d_{1111}A^4 + d_{1112}A^3B + \\frac{3}{2}d_{1122}A^2B^2 + \\dots $$\nThe potential of the point load is $V_P = -P\\,w(0,\\rho=0) = -P(A\\,\\psi_1(0) + B\\,\\psi_2(0))$.\nGiven $\\psi_1(\\rho) = (1-\\rho^2)^2$ and $\\psi_2(\\rho) = (1-2\\rho^2)(1-\\rho^2)^2$, we have $\\psi_1(0)=1$ and $\\psi_2(0)=1$. Thus, $V_P = -P(A+B)$.\n\nAt $N_0 = N_{\\text{cr}}$, the total potential energy is:\n$$ \\Pi(A,B) = \\frac{1}{2} (k_{22}^{(b)} - N_{\\text{cr}}k_{22}^{(g)}) B^2 + \\frac{1}{4}d_{1111}A^4 + d_{1112}A^3B + \\dots - P(A+B) $$\nThe equilibrium state is found by setting the partial derivatives of $\\Pi$ with respect to $A$ and $B$ to zero:\n$1$. $\\dfrac{\\partial\\Pi}{\\partial A} = d_{1111}A^3 + 3d_{1112}A^2B + \\dots - P = 0$\n$2$. $\\dfrac{\\partial\\Pi}{\\partial B} = (k_{22}^{(b)} - N_{\\text{cr}}k_{22}^{(g)}) B + d_{1112}A^3 + \\dots - P = 0$\n\nWe follow the procedure. From equation (2), we solve for $B$. We are interested in the case where $A$ is small and $P$ is of order $A^3$. The term $(k_{22}^{(b)} - N_{\\text{cr}}k_{22}^{(g)})$ is a non-zero constant, as $\\psi_2$ is not a critical mode. Balancing the leading terms in equation (2) (i.e., $B$, $A^3$, $P$), we find that $B$ must be of order $A^3$.\n$$ B = \\frac{P - d_{1112}A^3 - \\dots}{k_{22}^{(b)} - N_{\\text{cr}}k_{22}^{(g)}} = \\mathcal{O}(A^3, P) $$\nThis confirms the relation $B=\\mathcal{O}(A^3)$ provided in the problem statement.\n\nNow, substitute this result into equation (1). Any term involving $B$ will be of higher order. For instance, $3d_{1112}A^2B$ is of order $A^2 \\cdot A^3 = A^5$.\nTo leading order (up to $A^3$), equation (1) becomes:\n$$ d_{1111}A^3 - P = 0 $$\n$$ P = d_{1111}A^3 $$\nThis is the required relationship $P = cA^3 + \\mathcal{O}(A^5)$. By comparison, the cubic coefficient is $c = d_{1111}$.\n\nThe coefficient $d_{1111}$ is determined by the quartic energy term for the primary mode alone:\n$$ \\Pi_4(A,0) = \\frac{1}{4} d_{1111} A^4 $$\nThis term is the membrane strain energy $U_m$ associated with the deflection profile $w = A\\psi_1$:\n$$ U_m[A\\psi_1] = \\frac{1}{4} d_{1111} A^4 $$\nThe final step is to determine the sign of $d_{1111}$, which is the same as the sign of $U_m[A\\psi_1]$.\n\nThe problem explicitly states that \"the membrane energy is positive definite in terms of the nonlinear source $(\\partial w/\\partial r)^2$.\" The membrane energy $U_m$ represents the energy stored by stretching the plate's mid-surface. By the principles of elasticity, this strain energy must be non-negative. It can only be zero if the deformation induces no membrane strains (inextensional deformation).\nFor the given deflection shape $w = A(1-\\rho^2)^2$, the slope $\\partial w/\\partial r$ is non-zero for $A \\neq 0$ and $r \\in (0, a)$. A non-zero slope in a clamped plate necessarily induces mid-plane stretching. Therefore, the membrane strains are non-zero, and the membrane energy $U_m$ must be strictly positive for any non-zero amplitude A.\n$$ U_m[A\\psi_1] > 0 \\quad \\text{for } A \\neq 0 $$\nSince $\\frac{1}{4} d_{1111} A^4 > 0$ and $A^4 > 0$, it follows that $d_{1111} > 0$.\nTherefore, the coefficient $c = d_{1111}$ is positive. The sign is $+1$.\nThis result corresponds to a supercritical (stable) bifurcation, which is the known physical behavior for a clamped circular plate under uniform compression.", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{1} $$", "id": "2618857"}]}
