We shall proceed with a complete solution.\n\nThe problem is divided into two parts. First, we determine the elastic moduli from the given acoustic wave speeds. Second, we derive the Hugoniot Elastic Limit (HEL) using the von Mises yield criterion under conditions of uniaxial strain.\n\nFor an isotropic, linear elastic solid, the equations of motion in the absence of body forces are given by Navier's equation:\n$$ \\rho_{0} \\frac{\\partial^2 \\boldsymbol{u}}{\\partial t^2} = (\\lambda + G)\\nabla(\\nabla \\cdot \\boldsymbol{u}) + G \\nabla^2 \\boldsymbol{u} $$\nwhere $\\boldsymbol{u}$ is the displacement vector, $\\rho_{0}$ is the initial density, and $\\lambda$ and $G$ are the Lamé parameters.

We begin by deriving the expression for the Hugoniot pressure.\n\nThe analysis is performed in a frame of reference co-moving with the steady, planar shock front. The unshocked material (state $0$) flows into the shock at speed $U_{s}$, and the shocked material (state $1$) flows out at speed $U_{s} - u_{p}$.

The problem allows for the approximation that the isentrope is tangent to the Hugoniot at the shocked state. This implies:\n$$\n\\left( \\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial v} \\right)_{S} \\approx \\left( \\frac{\\mathrm{d}p}{\\mathrm{d}v} \\right)_{H}\n$$\nTherefore, the characteristic speed can be computed as:\n$$\nc^{2} \\approx -v^{2} \\left( \\frac{\\mathrm{d}p}{\\mathrm{d}v} \\right)_{H}\n$$\nTo calculate the slope of the Hugoniot, $(\\mathrm{d}p/\\mathrm{d}v)_{H}$, one must differentiate the parametric expressions for $p$ and $v$ with respect to the parameter $u_{p}$ and apply the chain rule:\n$$\n\\left( \\frac{\\mathrm{d}p}{\\mathrm{d}v} \\right)_{H} = \\frac{\\mathrm{d}p/\\mathrm{d}u_{p}}{\\mathrm{d}v/\\mathrm{d}u_{p}}\n$$\nLet $U_{s}' = \\mathrm{d}U_{s}/\\mathrm{d}u_{p}$. The required derivatives are:\n$$\n\\frac{\\mathrm{d}p}{\\mathrm{d}u_{p}} = \\frac{\\mathrm{d}}{\\mathrm{d}u_{p}} (\\rho_{0} U_{s} u_{p}) = \\rho_{0} \\left( U_{s} + u_{p} \\frac{\\mathrm{d}U_{s}}{\\mathrm{d}u_{p}} \\right) = \\rho_{0} (U_{s} + u_{p} U_{s}')\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\mathrm{d}v}{\\mathrm{d}u_{p}} = \\frac{\\mathrm{d}}{\\mathrm{d}u_{p}} \\left[ \\frac{1}{\\rho_{0}} \\left( 1 - \\frac{u_{p}}{U_{s}} \\right) \\right] = -\\frac{1}{\\rho_{0}} \\frac{U_{s} \\cdot 1 - u_{p} \\cdot U_{s}'}{U_{s}^{2}} = -\\frac{1}{\\rho_{0}} \\frac{U_{s} - u_{p} U_{s}'}{U_{s}^{2}}\n$$\nSubstituting these into the expression for the slope gives:\n$$\n\\left( \\frac{\\mathrm{d}p}{\\mathrm{d}v} \\right)_{H} = \\frac{\\rho_{0} (U_{s} + u_{p} U_{s}')}{-\\frac{1}{\\rho_{0}} \\frac{U_{s} - u_{p} U_{s}'}{U_{s}^{2}}} = -\\rho_{0}^{2} U_{s}^{2} \\frac{U_{s} + u_{p} U_{s}'}{U_{s} - u_{p} U_{s}'}\n$$\nNow, one substitutes this slope and the expression for $v$ into the formula for $c^{2}$:\n$$\nc^{2} = -v^{2} \\left( \\frac{\\mathrm{d}p}{\\mathrm{d}v} \\right)_{H} = - \\left[ \\frac{1}{\\rho_{0}} \\left(1 - \\frac{u_{p}}{U_{s}}\\right) \\right]^{2} \\left[ -\\rho_{0}^{2} U_{s}^{2} \\frac{U_{s} + u_{p} U_{s}'}{U_{s} - u_{p} U_{s}'} \\right]\n$$\n$$\nc^{2} = \\frac{1}{\\rho_{0}^{2}} \\frac{(U_{s} - u_{p})^{2}}{U_{s}^{2}} \\rho_{0}^{2} U_{s}^{2} \\frac{U_{s} + u_{p} U_{s}'}{U_{s} - u_{p} U_{s}'}\n$$\nThis simplifies to the final analytical expression for the characteristic speed squared:\n$$\nc(u_{p})^{2} = (U_{s} - u_{p})^{2} \\frac{U_{s} + u_{p} U_{s}'}{U_{s} - u_{p} U_{s}'}\n$$\nwhere $U_s$, $u_p$, and $U_s'$ are all evaluated at the same particle velocity $u_p$.\n\n### Part 3: Numerical Evaluation and Comparison\n\nThe given shock speed–particle speed relation is:\n$$\nU_{s}(u_{p}) = 5200 + 1.3\\,u_{p} + 1.0\\times 10^{-4}\\,u_{p}^{2}\n$$\nIts derivative with respect to $u_{p}$ is:\n$$\nU_{s}'(u_{p}) = \\frac{\\mathrm{d}U_{s}}{\\mathrm{d}u_{p}} = 1.3 + 2.0\\times 10^{-4}\\,u_{p}\n$$\nWe must evaluate $c(u_{p})$ at $u_{p}^{\\ast} = 1500\\,\\mathrm{m/s}$. First, calculate $U_{s}$ and $U_{s}'$ at this value:\n$$\nU_{s}(1500) = 5200 + 1.3(1500) + 1.0\\times 10^{-4}(1500)^{2} = 5200 + 1950 + 225 = 7375\\,\\mathrm{m/s}\n$$\n$$\nU_{s}'(1500) = 1.3 + 2.0\\times 10^{-4}(1500) = 1.3 + 0.3 = 1.6\n$$\nNow, these values are inserted into the expression for $c^{2}$:\n$$\nU_{s} - u_{p}^{\\ast} = 7375 - 1500 = 5875\\,\\mathrm{m/s}\n$$\n$$\nu_{p}^{\\ast} U_{s}' = 1500 \\times 1.6 = 2400\\,\\mathrm{m/s}\n$$\n$$\nc(1500)^{2} = (5875)^{2} \\left( \\frac{7375 + 2400}{7375 - 2400} \\right) = (5875)^{2} \\left( \\frac{9775}{4975} \\right)\n$$\nThe fraction simplifies:\n$$\n\\frac{9775}{4975} = \\frac{391 \\times 25}{199 \\times 25} = \\frac{391}{199}\n$$\nSo, the calculation becomes:\n$$\nc^{2} = (34515625) \\left(\\frac{391}{199}\\right) \\approx 67817132.54\\, (\\mathrm{m/s})^{2}\n$$\nTaking the square root to find the characteristic speed:\n$$\nc(1500) = \\sqrt{67817132.54} \\approx 8235.116\\,\\mathrm{m/s}\n$$\nThe problem requires the answer in $\\mathrm{km/s}$, rounded to four significant figures:\n$$\nc(u_{p}^{\\ast}) \\approx 8.235\\,\\mathrm{km/s}\n$$\nFor the qualitative comparison, the small-signal speed in the undisturbed material corresponds to the limit $u_{p} \\to 0$. From the given relation, this speed is the bulk sound speed $C_{0}$:\n$$\nC_{0} = U_{s}(0) = 5200\\,\\mathrm{m/s} = 5.200\\,\\mathrm{km/s}\n$$\nThe characteristic speed behind the shock, $c(1500) \\approx 8.235\\,\\mathrm{km/s}$, is substantially greater than the initial bulk sound speed $C_{0} = 5.200\\,\\mathrm{km/s}$. This is the expected physical behavior. The material behind a strong shock is significantly compressed and its effective stiffness (bulk modulus) is increased, leading to a higher sound speed compared to the uncompressed state.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{8.235}\n$$", "id": "2684925"}]}
