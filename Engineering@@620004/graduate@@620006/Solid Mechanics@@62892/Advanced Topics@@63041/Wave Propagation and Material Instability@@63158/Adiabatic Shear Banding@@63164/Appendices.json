It is rooted in the first law of thermodynamics as applied to continuum mechanics, a standard framework for analyzing thermomechanical processes such as adiabatic shear banding. The assumptions are standard simplifications used in the field of high-strain-rate plasticity to make the problem tractable while retaining the essential physics. The numerical values provided are physically realistic for metallic alloys under severe plastic deformation. The problem is well-posed, complete, and devoid of internal contradictions or ambiguities.\n\n**Verdict**\nThe problem is deemed **valid**. I will proceed with the solution.\n\n**Derivation of the Evolution Equation**\n\nThe derivation starts from the local form of the first law of thermodynamics for a continuum, which expresses the conservation of energy for a material point:\n$$\n\\rho \\frac{\\mathrm{d}u}{\\mathrm{d}t} = \\boldsymbol{\\sigma} : \\mathbf{D} + \\rho r - \\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{q}\n$$\nHere, $u$ is the specific internal energy (per unit mass), $\\rho$ is the mass density, $t$ is time, $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}$ is the Cauchy stress tensor, $\\mathbf{D}$ is the rate of deformation tensor, $r$ is the specific external heat supply rate (per unit mass), and $\\mathbf{q}$ is the heat flux vector.\n\nWe apply the given assumptions to simplify this equation:\n1.  **Adiabatic Process (Assumption i):** There are no external heat sources ($r=0$) and heat conduction is negligible ($\\mathbf{q}=\\mathbf{0}$). The first law reduces to:\n    $$\n    \\rho \\frac{\\mathrm{d}u}{\\mathrm{d}t} = \\boldsymbol{\\sigma} : \\mathbf{D}\n    $$\n    This states that the rate of change of internal energy density is equal to the mechanical power density supplied to the material.\n\n2.  **Energy Partition:** The specific internal energy $u$ consists of two parts: the thermal energy associated with temperature change and the stored energy of cold work $u_s$ (e.g., energy stored in the dislocation microstructure). With a constant specific heat $c$ (Assumption ii), the rate of change of $u$ is:\n    $$\n    \\frac{\\mathrm{d}u}{\\mathrm{d}t} = c \\frac{\\mathrm{d}T}{\\mathrm{d}t} + \\frac{\\mathrm{d}u_s}{\\mathrm{d}t}\n    $$\n    The mechanical power $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma} : \\mathbf{D}$ can be split into a recoverable elastic part and a dissipative plastic part, $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma} : \\mathbf{D} = \\boldsymbol{\\sigma} : \\mathbf{D}^e + \\boldsymbol{\\sigma} : \\mathbf{D}^p$. Assumption (iii) states that changes in elastic energy are negligible, so the power is almost entirely due to plastic work: $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma} : \\mathbf{D} \\approx \\boldsymbol{\\sigma} : \\mathbf{D}^p \\equiv \\dot{w}_p$, where $\\dot{w}_p$ is the plastic power per unit volume.\n\n3.  **Taylor-Quinney Assumption (Assumption iv):** A constant fraction $\\beta$ of the plastic power $\\dot{w}_p$ is converted into heat, causing a temperature rise. The rate of heat generation per unit volume is thus $\\beta \\dot{w}_p$. This thermal power increases the thermal energy component of the internal energy:\n    $$\n    \\rho c \\frac{\\mathrm{d}T}{\\mathrm{d}t} = \\beta \\dot{w}_p\n    $$\n    The remaining fraction, $(1-\\beta)\\dot{w}_p$, contributes to the rate of increase of stored energy of cold work, $\\rho \\frac{\\mathrm{d}u_s}{\\mathrm{d}t} = (1-\\beta)\\dot{w}_p$. Summing these two equations recovers the simplified first law.\n\n4.  **Simple Shear Kinematics (Assumption v):** For a state of simple shear, the plastic power per unit volume $\\dot{w}_p$ is given by the product of the resolved shear stress $\\tau$ and the plastic shear strain rate $\\dot{\\gamma} = \\frac{\\mathrm{d}\\gamma}{\\mathrm{d}t}$:\n    $$\n    \\dot{w}_p = \\tau \\dot{\\gamma}\n    $$\n    Substituting this into the energy balance equation gives:\n    $$\n    \\rho c \\frac{\\mathrm{d}T}{\\mathrm{d}t} = \\beta \\tau \\dot{\\gamma}\n    $$\n\n5.  **Change of Variable:** The objective is to find the rate of temperature change with respect to strain $\\gamma$, not time $t$. We use the chain rule to relate the time derivative of temperature to its strain derivative:\n    $$\n    \\frac{\\mathrm{d}T}{\\mathrm{d}t} = \\frac{\\mathrm{d}T}{\\mathrm{d}\\gamma} \\frac{\\mathrm{d}\\gamma}{\\mathrm{d}t} = \\frac{\\mathrm{d}T}{\\mathrm{d}\\gamma} \\dot{\\gamma}\n    $$\n    Substituting this expression into our energy equation yields:\n    $$\n    \\rho c \\left( \\frac{\\mathrm{d}T}{\\mathrm{d}\\gamma} \\dot{\\gamma} \\right) = \\beta \\tau \\dot{\\gamma}\n    $$\n    For plastic deformation to occur, the strain rate $\\dot{\\gamma}$ must be non-zero (specifically, $\\dot{\\gamma} > 0$). We can therefore divide both sides by $\\dot{\\gamma}$ to obtain the desired evolution equation:\n    $$\n    \\frac{\\mathrm{d}T}{\\mathrm{d}\\gamma} = \\frac{\\beta \\tau}{\\rho c}\n    $$\nThis concludes the derivation.\n\n**Calculation of Temperature Rise**\n\nWe are asked to find the total temperature rise $\\Delta T$ over a finite plastic strain increment $\\Delta \\gamma$, assuming $\\beta$, $\\tau$, and $\\rho c$ are constant over this increment. We can integrate the derived differential equation:\n$$\n\\int_{T_0}^{T_f} \\mathrm{d}T = \\int_{\\gamma_0}^{\\gamma_f} \\frac{\\beta \\tau}{\\rho c} \\mathrm{d}\\gamma\n$$\nwhere $T_0$ and $\\gamma_0$ are the initial temperature and strain, and $T_f$ and $\\gamma_f$ are the final values. Since the term $\\frac{\\beta \\tau}{\\rho c}$ is constant, it can be taken out of the integral:\n$$\nT_f - T_0 = \\frac{\\beta \\tau}{\\rho c} (\\gamma_f - \\gamma_0)\n$$\nThis gives the expression for the temperature rise $\\Delta T = T_f - T_0$:\n$$\n\\Delta T = \\frac{\\beta \\tau}{\\rho c} \\Delta \\gamma\n$$\nNow, we substitute the provided numerical values:\n-   $\\beta = 0.9$ (dimensionless)\n-   $\\tau = 1.2 \\times 10^{9}\\,\\mathrm{Pa}$\n-   $\\rho c = 3.0 \\times 10^{6}\\,\\mathrm{J}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{K}^{-1}$\n-   $\\Delta \\gamma = 1$ (dimensionless)\n\nIt is critical to verify unit consistency. The unit of stress, Pascal, is $\\mathrm{Pa} = \\mathrm{N}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-2}$. Since $\\mathrm{J} = \\mathrm{N}\\,\\mathrm{m}$, we have $\\mathrm{Pa} = \\mathrm{J}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-3}$. Thus, the units for the expression are:\n$$\n\\frac{[\\text{dimensionless}] \\times [\\mathrm{J}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-3}]}{[\\mathrm{J}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{K}^{-1}]} \\times [\\text{dimensionless}] = \\mathrm{K}\n$$\nThe units are correct.\n\nPerforming the calculation:\n$$\n\\Delta T = \\frac{0.9 \\times (1.2 \\times 10^{9})}{3.0 \\times 10^{6}} \\times 1\n$$\n$$\n\\Delta T = \\frac{1.08 \\times 10^{9}}{3.0 \\times 10^{6}}\n$$\n$$\n\\Delta T = \\left(\\frac{1.08}{3.0}\\right) \\times 10^{(9-6)}\n$$\n$$\n\\Delta T = 0.36 \\times 10^{3}\n$$\n$$\n\\Delta T = 360\\,\\mathrm{K}\n$$\nThe result `360` is an exact number derived from the given data.

It is scientifically sound, well-posed, and requires a solution based on fundamental physical principles. We shall proceed with the derivation and calculation.\n\nThe formation of an adiabatic shear band is governed by the competition between two processes: heat generation from mechanical work and heat conduction away from the band. We are tasked to find the characteristic time scales for each process.\n\nFirst, we consider the thermal diffusion process. The temperature evolution $T(x, t)$ within the band is described by the one-dimensional heat equation:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial t} = \\alpha \\frac{\\partial^2 T}{\\partial x^2}\n$$\nHere, $t$ is time and $x$ is the spatial coordinate across the band thickness. A characteristic time scale, which we shall denote $\\tau_{th}$, can be found by dimensional analysis of this equation. We approximate the derivatives using characteristic quantities. The characteristic length scale for diffusion is the thickness of the band, $h$. The temporal derivative can be approximated as $\\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial t} \\sim \\frac{\\Delta T}{\\tau_{th}}$, and the spatial second derivative as $\\frac{\\partial^2 T}{\\partial x^2} \\sim \\frac{\\Delta T}{h^2}$, where $\\Delta T$ is a characteristic temperature change.\nSubstituting these into the heat equation gives a balance of scales:\n$$\n\\frac{\\Delta T}{\\tau_{th}} \\sim \\alpha \\frac{\\Delta T}{h^2}\n$$\nSolving for the thermal diffusion time scale, $\\tau_{th}$, we obtain:\n$$\n\\tau_{th} = \\frac{h^2}{\\alpha}\n$$\nThis represents the characteristic time required for heat to diffuse across the distance $h$.\n\nNext, we derive the characteristic time scale for mechanical deformation. The problem provides the imposed shear strain rate, $\\dot{\\gamma}$. By definition, the strain rate is the rate of change of strain, $\\gamma$:\n$$\n\\dot{\\gamma} = \\frac{d\\gamma}{dt}\n$$\nA characteristic time scale for the mechanical process, $\\tau_{mech}$, is the time required to accumulate a significant amount of strain. In the context of large plastic deformation and flow localization, it is standard to consider a characteristic strain of order unity, i.e., $\\Delta \\gamma \\sim 1$. Using a finite difference approximation, $\\dot{\\gamma} \\sim \\frac{\\Delta \\gamma}{\\tau_{mech}}$. With $\\Delta \\gamma \\sim 1$, we find the mechanical deformation time scale to be:\n$$\n\\tau_{mech} = \\frac{1}{\\dot{\\gamma}}\n$$\nThis represents the characteristic time over which significant plastic straining occurs.\n\nThe problem requires the calculation of the ratio $R$ of the thermal diffusion time scale to the deformation time scale:\n$$\nR = \\frac{\\tau_{th}}{\\tau_{mech}} = \\frac{h^2 / \\alpha}{1 / \\dot{\\gamma}} = \\frac{h^2 \\dot{\\gamma}}{\\alpha}\n$$\nThis dimensionless ratio compares the time needed for heat to escape the band with the time it takes to generate that heat through deformation. If $R \\gg 1$, deformation is much faster than thermal diffusion, leading to a temperature rise and thermal softening, which are the conditions for *adiabatic* shear.\n\nWe now substitute the given numerical values into the expression for $R$. It is imperative to maintain consistent units (SI units).\nGiven:\n-   $h = 50\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m} = 50 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{m} = 5 \\times 10^{-5}\\,\\mathrm{m}$\n-   $\\alpha = 1.2 \\times 10^{-5}\\,\\mathrm{m}^2/\\mathrm{s}$\n-   $\\dot{\\gamma} = 10^{4}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$\n\nThe calculation proceeds as follows:\n$$\nR = \\frac{(5 \\times 10^{-5}\\,\\mathrm{m})^2 (10^{4}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1})}{1.2 \\times 10^{-5}\\,\\mathrm{m}^2/\\mathrm{s}}\n$$\n$$\nR = \\frac{(25 \\times 10^{-10}\\,\\mathrm{m}^2) (10^{4}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1})}{1.2 \\times 10^{-5}\\,\\mathrm{m}^2/\\mathrm{s}}\n$$\n$$\nR = \\frac{25 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{m}^2 \\cdot \\mathrm{s}^{-1}}{1.2 \\times 10^{-5}\\,\\mathrm{m}^2 \\cdot \\mathrm{s}^{-1}}\n$$\nThe units cancel, confirming that $R$ is a dimensionless quantity.\n$$\nR = \\frac{25 \\times 10^{-6}}{12 \\times 10^{-6}} = \\frac{25}{12}\n$$\n$$\nR = 2.08333...\n$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to three significant figures.\n$$\nR \\approx 2.08\n$$\nThe value $R \\approx 2.08$ is greater than $1$, which confirms that the conditions are favorable for adiabatic shear localization, as heat is generated more rapidly than it is conducted away.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{2.08}$$", "id": "2613647"}]}
