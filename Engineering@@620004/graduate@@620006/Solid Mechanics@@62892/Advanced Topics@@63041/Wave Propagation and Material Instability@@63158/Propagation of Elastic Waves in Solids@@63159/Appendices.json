It presents a classical exercise in continuum mechanics, specifically the theory of elastic waves. We shall proceed with the derivation.\n\nThe fundamental equation governing the motion of a continuous medium is the balance of linear momentum, which in its local form is Cauchy's first law of motion. For a solid of mass density $\\rho$ subjected to a stress field $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}$ and a body force per unit volume $\\mathbf{b}$, this law is expressed as:\n$$ \\nabla \\cdot \\boldsymbol{\\sigma} + \\mathbf{b} = \\rho \\frac{\\partial^2 \\mathbf{u}}{\\partial t^2} $$\nwhere $\\mathbf{u}(\\mathbf{x}, t)$ is the displacement vector field. The problem states that body forces are absent, so $\\mathbf{b} = \\mathbf{0}$. The equation of motion thus simplifies to:\n$$ \\nabla \\cdot \\boldsymbol{\\sigma} = \\rho \\frac{\\partial^2 \\mathbf{u}}{\\partial t^2} $$\n\nThe material is specified as a homogeneous, linear, isotropic, elastic solid undergoing infinitesimal motions. The constitutive relation connecting the stress tensor $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}$ to the infinitesimal strain tensor $\\boldsymbol{\\epsilon}$ for such a material is given by Hooke's law:\n$$ \\boldsymbol{\\sigma} = \\lambda (\\text{tr}(\\boldsymbol{\\epsilon})) \\mathbf{I} + 2\\mu \\boldsymbol{\\epsilon} $$\nwhere $\\lambda$ and $\\mu$ are the Lamé parameters and $\\mathbf{I}$ is the second-order identity tensor. The infinitesimal strain tensor is related to the displacement field by:\n$$ \\boldsymbol{\\epsilon} = \\frac{1}{2} \\left( \\nabla\\mathbf{u} + (\\nabla\\mathbf{u})^T \\right) $$\nThe trace of the strain tensor, $\\text{tr}(\\boldsymbol{\\epsilon})$, represents the volumetric strain and is equal to the divergence of the displacement field, $\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{u}$. Substituting this into the constitutive relation yields:\n$$ \\boldsymbol{\\sigma} = \\lambda (\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{u}) \\mathbf{I} + \\mu \\left( \\nabla\\mathbf{u} + (\\nabla\\mathbf{u})^T \\right) $$\n\nWe now substitute this expression for $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}$ into the equation of motion:\n$$ \\nabla \\cdot \\left[ \\lambda (\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{u}) \\mathbf{I} + \\mu \\left( \\nabla\\mathbf{u} + (\\nabla\\mathbf{u})^T \\right) \\right] = \\rho \\frac{\\partial^2 \\mathbf{u}}{\\partial t^2} $$\nFor a homogeneous material, $\\lambda$ and $\\mu$ are constants. Using the vector calculus identities $\\nabla \\cdot (f \\mathbf{I}) = \\nabla f$ and $\\nabla \\cdot (\\nabla \\mathbf{u} + (\\nabla \\mathbf{u})^T) = \\nabla^2 \\mathbf{u} + \\nabla(\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{u})$, the divergence term expands as:\n$$ \\lambda \\nabla(\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{u}) + \\mu \\nabla^2 \\mathbf{u} + \\mu \\nabla(\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{u}) = (\\lambda + \\mu) \\nabla(\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{u}) + \\mu \\nabla^2 \\mathbf{u} $$\nThis leads to the Navier-Cauchy equation, which is the governing equation for wave propagation in the specified medium:\n$$ (\\lambda + \\mu) \\nabla(\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{u}) + \\mu \\nabla^2 \\mathbf{u} = \\rho \\frac{\\partial^2 \\mathbf{u}}{\\partial t^2} $$\n\nTo find the conditions for plane wave propagation, we seek a solution of the form:\n$$ \\mathbf{u}(\\mathbf{x}, t) = \\mathbf{A} \\exp \\left[ i(\\mathbf{k} \\cdot \\mathbf{x} - \\omega t) \\right] $$\nwhere $\\mathbf{A}$ is the constant polarization vector, $\\mathbf{k}$ is the wave vector, and $\\omega$ is the angular frequency. We compute the necessary derivatives:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial^2 \\mathbf{u}}{\\partial t^2} = -\\omega^2 \\mathbf{u} $$\n$$ \\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{u} = i(\\mathbf{k} \\cdot \\mathbf{A}) \\exp \\left[ i(\\mathbf{k} \\cdot \\mathbf{x} - \\omega t) \\right] = i(\\mathbf{k} \\cdot \\mathbf{u}) $$\n$$ \\nabla(\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{u}) = -\\mathbf{k}(\\mathbf{k} \\cdot \\mathbf{A}) \\exp \\left[ i(\\mathbf{k} \\cdot \\mathbf{x} - \\omega t) \\right] = -\\mathbf{k}(\\mathbf{k} \\cdot \\mathbf{u}) $$\n$$ \\nabla^2 \\mathbf{u} = -|\\mathbf{k}|^2 \\mathbf{u} = -k^2 \\mathbf{u} $$\nSubstituting these derivatives into the Navier-Cauchy equation gives:\n$$ -(\\lambda + \\mu) \\mathbf{k}(\\mathbf{k} \\cdot \\mathbf{u}) - \\mu k^2 \\mathbf{u} = -\\rho \\omega^2 \\mathbf{u} $$\nDividing by the common exponential factor and rearranging, we obtain Christoffel's equation for an isotropic medium, which is the governing condition for plane waves:\n$$ (\\lambda + \\mu) \\mathbf{k}(\\mathbf{k} \\cdot \\mathbf{A}) + \\mu k^2 \\mathbf{A} = \\rho \\omega^2 \\mathbf{A} $$\n\nWe analyze two distinct cases for the orientation of the polarization vector $\\mathbf{A}$ relative to the wave vector $\\mathbf{k}$.\n\nCase 1: Longitudinal (Compressional) Wave\nThe particle displacement is parallel to the direction of wave propagation, i.e., $\\mathbf{A} \\parallel \\mathbf{k}$. This implies $\\mathbf{k} \\cdot \\mathbf{A} = k A$ (assuming $\\mathbf{A}$ and $\\mathbf{k}$ point in the same direction) and $\\mathbf{k} = k \\hat{\\mathbf{k}}$, where $\\hat{\\mathbf{k}}$ is a unit vector. The equation becomes:\n$$ (\\lambda + \\mu) (k \\hat{\\mathbf{k}}) (k A) + \\mu k^2 (A \\hat{\\mathbf{k}}) = \\rho \\omega^2 (A \\hat{\\mathbf{k}}) $$\n$$ \\left( (\\lambda + \\mu) k^2 + \\mu k^2 \\right) A \\hat{\\mathbf{k}} = \\rho \\omega^2 A \\hat{\\mathbf{k}} $$\nSince $A \\neq 0$, we have $(\\lambda + 2\\mu) k^2 = \\rho \\omega^2$. The phase velocity $c_p$ is defined as $\\omega/k$. Thus, we find:\n$$ \\rho c_p^2 = \\lambda + 2\\mu \\implies c_p = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\lambda + 2\\mu}{\\rho}} $$\n\nCase 2: Transverse (Shear) Wave\nThe particle displacement is perpendicular to the direction of wave propagation, i.e., $\\mathbf{A} \\perp \\mathbf{k}$. This means $\\mathbf{k} \\cdot \\mathbf{A} = 0$.

The phase velocity of the transverse wave, $c_s$, is therefore:\n$$ \\rho c_s^2 = \\mu \\implies c_s = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\mu}{\\rho}} $$\n\nThe problem requires the velocities in terms of Young's modulus $E$ and Poisson's ratio $\\nu$. The relations between these constants and the Lamé parameters are:\n$$ \\mu = \\frac{E}{2(1+\\nu)} $$\n$$ \\lambda = \\frac{E \\nu}{(1+\\nu)(1-2\\nu)} $$\nSubstituting these into the expressions for $c_s$ and $c_p$:\nFor the shear wave velocity $c_s$:\n$$ c_s = \\sqrt{\\frac{E}{2\\rho(1+\\nu)}} $$\nFor the compressional wave velocity $c_p$, we first compute $\\lambda + 2\\mu$:\n$$ \\lambda + 2\\mu = \\frac{E \\nu}{(1+\\nu)(1-2\\nu)} + 2 \\left( \\frac{E}{2(1+\\nu)} \\right) = \\frac{E \\nu + E(1-2\\nu)}{(1+\\nu)(1-2\\nu)} = \\frac{E(1-\\nu)}{(1+\\nu)(1-2\\nu)} $$\nThus, the compressional wave velocity is:\n$$ c_p = \\sqrt{\\frac{E(1-\\nu)}{\\rho(1+\\nu)(1-2\\nu)}} $$\n\nFinally, we compute the numerical values using the provided data: $E = 210 \\text{ GPa} = 210 \\times 10^9 \\text{ Pa}$, $\\nu = 0.28$, and $\\rho = 7800 \\text{ kg/m}^3$.\n\nCalculation for $c_s$:\n$$ c_s = \\sqrt{\\frac{210 \\times 10^9}{2(7800)(1+0.28)}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{210 \\times 10^9}{2(7800)(1.28)}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{210 \\times 10^9}{19968}} \\approx 3242.965 \\text{ m/s} $$\nExpressed in km/s and rounded to four significant figures, $c_s = 3.243 \\text{ km/s}$.\n\nCalculation for $c_p$:\n$$ c_p = \\sqrt{\\frac{(210 \\times 10^9)(1-0.28)}{(7800)(1+0.28)(1-2(0.28))}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{(210 \\times 10^9)(0.72)}{(7800)(1.28)(0.44)}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{1.512 \\times 10^{11}}{4392.96}} \\approx 5866.742 \\text{ m/s} $$\nExpressed in km/s and rounded to four significant figures, $c_p = 5.867 \\text{ km/s}$.\n\nThe final requested answer is the row vector containing $c_p$ and $c_s$ in that order.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n5.867 & 3.243\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "2882137"}, {"introduction": "Having established the behavior of waves in an infinite medium, we now introduce a boundary to form a half-space, a model crucial for geophysics and surface acoustics.

I will proceed with a full derivation and solution.\n\nThe solution is structured as follows: First, the governing equations for elastic waves are derived from fundamental principles. Second, these equations are specialized for a two-dimensional surface wave using the method of potentials. Third, the application of traction-free boundary conditions leads to the Rayleigh dispersion equation. Fourth, the existence and uniqueness of a physically admissible solution to this equation are proven. Finally, a numerical algorithm is designed to solve the equation, results are computed for the specified test cases, and the behavior of the wave speed as a function of material properties is discussed.\n\n**1. Governing Equations and Potentials**\n\nThe motion of a continuum is governed by Cauchy's momentum balance equation, which in the absence of body forces is given by:\n$$ \\rho \\frac{\\partial^2 \\mathbf{u}}{\\partial t^2} = \\nabla \\cdot \\boldsymbol{\\sigma} $$\nwhere $\\rho$ is the mass density, $\\mathbf{u}$ is the displacement vector field, and $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}$ is the Cauchy stress tensor.

Two-Dimensional Surface Wave Solution**\n\nWe consider a two-dimensional plane-strain problem where the wave propagates in the $x$-direction along the surface of the half-space $y \\ge 0$, and the displacement is confined to the $xy$-plane. Thus, $\\mathbf{u} = (u_x(x,y,t), u_y(x,y,t), 0)$ and all fields are independent of $z$. The vector potential simplifies to $\\boldsymbol{\\psi} = (0, 0, \\psi(x,y,t))$, and the displacement components are:\n$$ u_x = \\frac{\\partial\\phi}{\\partial x} - \\frac{\\partial\\psi}{\\partial y} \\quad , \\quad u_y = \\frac{\\partial\\phi}{\\partial y} + \\frac{\\partial\\psi}{\\partial x} $$\nWe seek harmonic wave solutions of the form:\n$$ \\phi(x,y,t) = \\Phi(y) e^{i(kx - \\omega t)} $$\n$$ \\psi(x,y,t) = \\Psi(y) e^{i(kx - \\omega t)} $$\nwhere $k$ is the wavenumber and $\\omega$ is the angular frequency.

For the wave to be a surface wave, its amplitude must decay with depth $y \\to \\infty$. This requires the coefficients in the above ODEs to be positive, implying that $c_R < c_s$ and $c_R < c_p$. Since for any physically stable material $\\lambda+2\\mu > \\mu > 0$, we have $c_p > c_s$, so the decay condition simplifies to $c_R < c_s$.\n\nLet us define the real, positive decay constants $q$ and $r$:\n$$ q = k\\sqrt{1 - c_R^2/c_p^2} \\quad , \\quad r = k\\sqrt{1 - c_R^2/c_s^2} $$\nThe decaying solutions for $\\Phi(y)$ and $\\Psi(y)$ are:\n$$ \\Phi(y) = A e^{-qy} \\quad , \\quad \\Psi(y) = B e^{-ry} $$\nwhere $A$ and $B$ are complex constants.\n\n**3. Boundary Conditions and Dispersion Relation**\n\nThe half-space has a traction-free boundary at $y=0$. The traction vector on a surface with normal $\\mathbf{n}$ is $\\mathbf{t} = \\boldsymbol{\\sigma} \\cdot \\mathbf{n}$. For the surface $y=0$, the outward normal is $(0, -1, 0)$, but it is computationally simpler to use the stress components directly: the conditions are $\\sigma_{yy}(x,0,t) = 0$ and $\\sigma_{xy}(x,0,t) = 0$ for all $x$ and $t$.\n\nThe stress components in terms of potentials $\\phi$ and $\\psi$ are:\n$$ \\sigma_{yy} = \\lambda \\nabla^2\\phi + 2\\mu \\left(\\frac{\\partial^2\\phi}{\\partial y^2} + \\frac{\\partial^2\\psi}{\\partial x \\partial y}\\right) $$\n$$ \\sigma_{xy} = \\mu \\left(2\\frac{\\partial^2\\phi}{\\partial x \\partial y} - \\frac{\\partial^2\\psi}{\\partial y^2} + \\frac{\\partial^2\\psi}{\\partial x^2}\\right) $$\nApplying these conditions at $y=0$ yields a system of two linear homogeneous equations for the amplitudes $A$ and $B$:\n$$ \\begin{pmatrix} \\mu (k^2(2 - c_R^2/c_s^2)) & -2i\\mu k r \\\\ -2i\\mu k q & \\mu (k^2(c_R^2/c_s^2 - 2)) \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} A \\\\ B \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix} $$\nLetting $s = (c_R/c_s)^2$, the system becomes:\n$$ \\begin{pmatrix} \\mu k^2 (2 - s) & -2i\\mu k r \\\\ -2i\\mu k q & \\mu k^2 (s - 2) \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} A \\\\ B \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix} $$\nFor a non-trivial solution (i.e., for $A, B$ not both zero), the determinant of the coefficient matrix must be zero:\n$$ (\\mu k^2 (2-s))(\\mu k^2 (s-2)) - (-2i\\mu k r)(-2i\\mu k q) = 0 $$\n$$ -\\mu^2 k^4 (2-s)^2 - 4\\mu^2 k^2 r q = 0 $$\n$$ (2-s)^2 = \\frac{4rq}{k^2} $$\nSubstituting the definitions of $q$ and $r$:\n$$ (2-s)^2 = 4\\sqrt{1-s}\\sqrt{1-s\\kappa} $$\nwhere $\\kappa=c_s^2/c_p^2$. Squaring both sides to remove the radicals yields the Rayleigh characteristic equation:\n$$ (2-s)^4 = 16(1-s)(1-s\\kappa) $$\nThe parameter $\\kappa = c_s^2/c_p^2 = \\mu/(\\lambda+2\\mu)$ can be expressed in terms of Poisson's ratio $\\nu = \\lambda/(2(\\lambda+\\mu))$:\n$$ \\kappa = \\frac{1-2\\nu}{2(1-\\nu)} $$\nThe thermodynamically stable range for $\\nu$ is $(-1, 1/2)$, which corresponds to $\\kappa \\in (0, 3/4)$.\n\n**4. Uniqueness of the Physical Root**\n\nThe characteristic equation can be expanded and rearranged into a polynomial form.\n$ s^4 - 8s^3 + 24s^2 - 32s + 16 = 16 - 16(1+\\kappa)s + 16\\kappa s^2 $.\n$ s^4 - 8s^3 + (24-16\\kappa)s^2 + (16\\kappa-16)s = 0 $.\nThis equation has a trivial root $s=0$, which corresponds to a zero-speed wave and is not physically relevant for propagation. Factoring out $s$ yields the cubic Rayleigh polynomial:\n$$ P(s) = s^3 - 8s^2 + (24-16\\kappa)s - 16(1-\\kappa) = 0 $$\nWe must prove that for each $\\kappa \\in (0, 3/4)$, this polynomial has exactly one root in the interval $s \\in (0,1)$, which corresponds to a physically admissible Rayleigh wave satisfying $0 < c_R < c_s$.\n\n1.  **Behavior at Endpoints**: Let's evaluate $P(s)$ at the endpoints of the interval $(0,1)$.\n    At $s=0$: $P(0) = -16(1-\\kappa)$. Since $\\kappa \\in (0, 3/4)$, $1-\\kappa$ is positive, so $P(0) < 0$.\n    At $s=1$: $P(1) = 1-8+(24-16\\kappa)-16(1-\\kappa) = 1-8+24-16\\kappa-16+16\\kappa = 1$. So $P(1) > 0$.\n    Since $P(s)$ is a continuous function and changes sign from negative to positive over the interval $(0,1)$, the Intermediate Value Theorem guarantees the existence of at least one root in $(0,1)$.\n\n2.  **Monotonicity/Concavity**: To prove uniqueness, we analyze the curvature of $P(s)$. The second derivative is:\n    $$ P'(s) = 3s^2 - 16s + (24-16\\kappa) $$\n    $$ P''(s) = 6s - 16 $$\n    For any $s$ in the interval $(0,1)$, $6s \\in (0,6)$, which means $P''(s) = 6s - 16$ is always negative.\n    Since $P''(s) < 0$ for all $s \\in (0,1)$, the function $P(s)$ is strictly concave on this interval.\n\n3.  **Conclusion**: A strictly concave function that starts below the horizontal axis ($P(0) < 0$) and ends above it ($P(1) > 0$) must cross the axis exactly once within that interval. It cannot turn back to cross a second time without violating the concavity property. Therefore, for any valid Poisson's ratio, there exists exactly one physically admissible Rayleigh wave speed.\n\n**5. Numerical Solution and Discussion**\n\nThe task reduces to finding the unique root of the cubic polynomial $P(s)=0$ in the interval $(0,1)$ for a given $\\kappa(\\nu)$. A robust numerical method is a bracketing root-finder, such as the bisection method or Brent's method. Given that we have a proven bracket $[0,1]$ within which a unique root exists, these methods are guaranteed to converge. We will use Brent's method for its superior convergence rate.\n\nThe algorithm is as follows:\n1.  Given a Poisson's ratio $\\nu \\in (-1, 1/2)$.\n2.  Calculate $\\kappa = (1-2\\nu)/(2(1-\\nu))$.\n3.  Define the cubic function $P(s) = s^3 - 8s^2 + (24-16\\kappa)s - 16(1-\\kappa)$.\n4.  Use Brent's method to find the root $s$ of $P(s)=0$ in the interval $[0,1]$ with a small tolerance (e.g., $10^{-15}$) to ensure high accuracy.\n5.  The desired dimensionless ratio is $c_R/c_s = \\sqrt{s}$.\n\n**Discussion of Results**:\nThe relationship between the wave speed ratio and Poisson's ratio can be analyzed using the implicit function theorem on $P(s, \\kappa)=0$. We find $\\frac{ds}{d\\nu} = \\frac{ds}{d\\kappa}\\frac{d\\kappa}{d\\nu}$. As shown previously, $\\frac{d\\kappa}{d\\nu} < 0$. The derivative $\\frac{ds}{d\\kappa} = -(\\partial P/\\partial\\kappa)/(\\partial P/\\partial s)$. The denominator $\\partial P/\\partial s = P'(s)$, which is positive over most of the range of interest. The numerator $\\partial P/\\partial\\kappa = -16s+16 = 16(1-s)$, which is positive for $s \\in (0,1)$. Thus, $\\frac{ds}{d\\kappa}$ is negative. The product $\\frac{ds}{d\\nu}$ is positive, meaning $s$ (and thus $c_R/c_s$) is an increasing function of $\\nu$.\n\n-   As $\\nu \\to 1/2^-$ (incompressible limit), $\\kappa \\to 0$.

This practice introduces this realism by modeling the solid as viscoelastic, which is accomplished by using complex-valued Lamé moduli that depend on frequency $\\omega$. You will analyze how this energy loss affects the propagation of Rayleigh waves, culminating in a fascinating question: when does the attenuation become so strong that the wave can no longer be considered a propagating mode? This exercise provides critical insight into the physics of damping and its profound effect on guided waves in real-world materials.
