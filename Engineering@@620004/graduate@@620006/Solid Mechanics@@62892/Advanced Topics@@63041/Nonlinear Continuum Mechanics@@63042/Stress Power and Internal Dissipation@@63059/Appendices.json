It is well-posed, as all necessary information for the calculation is provided. The language is objective and precise. While the prescribed fields $\\mathbf{\\sigma}(t)$ and $\\mathbf{v}(x,t)$ may not satisfy Cauchy's equation of motion for a material with non-zero density ($\\rho \\neq 0$) and arbitrary $\\alpha(t)$, the problem does not require a full dynamic analysis. It asks for the evaluation of the internal power functional for the *given* fields. This is a standard and valid exercise in mechanics to test the understanding of kinematic and power concepts. Therefore, the problem is deemed valid.\n\n**Derivation of Internal Power**\n\nThe internal power, $P_{\\mathrm{int}}$, represents the rate at which mechanical work is done by stresses on the deforming material within its volume, $V$. It is defined as the volume integral of the stress power density, $w$.\n$$\nP_{\\mathrm{int}} = \\int_V w \\, dV\n$$\nThe local stress power density, $w$, is given by the double-dot product of the Cauchy stress tensor, $\\mathbf{\\sigma}$, and the rate-of-deformation tensor, $\\mathbf{D}$.\n$$\nw = \\mathbf{\\sigma} : \\mathbf{D}\n$$\nTo proceed, we must first determine the rate-of-deformation tensor $\\mathbf{D}$ from the given velocity field.\n\nThe velocity field is given in an Eulerian description as $\\mathbf{v}(x,t) = \\alpha(t)x \\mathbf{e}_x$, where $\\mathbf{e}_x$ is the unit vector along the bar's axis. In Cartesian coordinates $(x_1, x_2, x_3) = (x, y, z)$, the velocity vector components are $v_1 = \\alpha(t)x_1$, $v_2 = 0$, and $v_3 = 0$.\n\nThe velocity gradient tensor, $\\mathbf{L}$, is defined by its components $L_{ij} = \\frac{\\partial v_i}{\\partial x_j}$. We compute its components:\n$$\nL_{11} = \\frac{\\partial v_1}{\\partial x_1} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}(\\alpha(t)x) = \\alpha(t)\n$$\nAll other components of $\\mathbf{L}$ are zero since $v_2$ and $v_3$ are zero, and $v_1$ does not depend on $x_2$ or $x_3$. Thus, the velocity gradient tensor is:\n$$\n\\mathbf{L} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\alpha(t) & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe rate-of-deformation tensor, $\\mathbf{D}$, is the symmetric part of the velocity gradient tensor: $\\mathbf{D} = \\frac{1}{2}(\\mathbf{L} + \\mathbf{L}^T)$. Since $\\mathbf{L}$ is already a symmetric tensor in this case, we have $\\mathbf{D} = \\mathbf{L}$.\n$$\n\\mathbf{D} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\alpha(t) & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe term $\\alpha(t)$ is recognized as the rate of axial stretching, $D_{xx}$.\n\nThe stress field is a uniform uniaxial stress $\\sigma(t)$ along the $x$-axis. The Cauchy stress tensor is given by:\n$$\n\\mathbf{\\sigma} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\sigma(t) & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThis follows from the problem statement of a \"uniaxial bar\" subject to \"axial Cauchy stress\".\n\nNow we can compute the stress power density, $w = \\mathbf{\\sigma} : \\mathbf{D}$, as required by the problem's emphasis on clarifying this step. The double-dot product is the sum of the products of corresponding components:\n$$\nw = \\sum_{i=1}^{3} \\sum_{j=1}^{3} \\sigma_{ij} D_{ij} = \\sigma_{11}D_{11} + \\sigma_{22}D_{22} + \\sigma_{33}D_{33} + 2\\sigma_{12}D_{12} + 2\\sigma_{13}D_{13} + 2\\sigma_{23}D_{23}\n$$\nSubstituting the components of $\\mathbf{\\sigma}$ and $\\mathbf{D}$:\n$$\nw = \\sigma(t) \\cdot \\alpha(t) + 0 \\cdot 0 + 0 \\cdot 0 + 2 \\cdot 0 \\cdot 0 + ... = \\sigma(t) \\alpha(t)\n$$\nThis is the local rate of work per unit volume being done on the material.\n\nFinally, to find the total internal power, $P_{\\mathrm{int}}$, we integrate this density over the entire volume of the bar. The volume element is $dV = A \\, dx$. The bar extends from $x=0$ to $x=L$.\n$$\nP_{\\mathrm{int}}(t) = \\int_V w \\, dV = \\int_V \\sigma(t) \\alpha(t) \\, dV\n$$\nSince both $\\sigma(t)$ and $\\alpha(t)$ are spatially uniform (independent of $x$), they can be taken outside the integral.\n$$\nP_{\\mathrm{int}}(t) = \\sigma(t) \\alpha(t) \\int_V dV\n$$\nThe total volume $V$ of the prismatic bar is its cross-sectional area $A$ multiplied by its length $L$, so $V = A L$.\n$$\nP_{\\mathrm{int}}(t) = \\sigma(t) \\alpha(t) (A L)\n$$\nThis provides the instantaneous internal power for the entire bar. The units are $(\\text{Force}/\\text{Area}) \\times (1/\\text{Time}) \\times (\\text{Area} \\times \\text{Length}) = (\\text{Force} \\times \\text{Length}) / \\text{Time}$, which corresponds to Power (e.g., Watts in SI units), as requested.\n\nA brief physical interpretation of the sign of $P_{\\mathrm{int}}$: The term $\\alpha(t)$ represents the axial strain rate. If the stress $\\sigma(t)$ and strain rate $\\alpha(t)$ have the same sign (e.g., tension and elongation, or compression and shortening), then $P_{\\mathrm{int}} > 0$. This signifies that power is being supplied to the material, increasing its internal energy (either as stored elastic energy or dissipated as heat). If they have opposite signs (e.g., tension during shortening), then $P_{\\mathrm{int}} < 0$, signifying that the material is releasing energy and doing work on its surroundings.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\sigma \\alpha A L}\n$$", "id": "2691185"}, {"introduction": "Having calculated the total internal power, we now deepen our understanding by asking a more fundamental question: what part of the material's motion is actually responsible for this work?

The internal power per unit volume, or stress power density, is given by the scalar product $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}:\\mathbf{L}$, where $\\mathbf{L}$ is the velocity gradient tensor. The derivation will proceed in three steps as requested.\n\n**Step 1: Kinematic Decomposition**\n\nFirst, we compute the velocity gradient tensor $\\mathbf{L}$, whose components are defined as $L_{ij} = \\frac{\\partial v_i}{\\partial x_j}$. Given the velocity field $\\mathbf{v} = (v_1, v_2, v_3) = (\\dot{\\gamma} x_2, 0, 0)$, the only non-zero component of $\\mathbf{L}$ is:\n$$ L_{12} = \\frac{\\partial v_1}{\\partial x_2} = \\frac{\\partial (\\dot{\\gamma} x_2)}{\\partial x_2} = \\dot{\\gamma} $$\nAll other components $L_{ij}$ are zero. In matrix form, the velocity gradient tensor is:\n$$ \\mathbf{L} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & \\dot{\\gamma} & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} $$\nThe velocity gradient tensor $\\mathbf{L}$ can be uniquely decomposed into its symmetric part, the rate of deformation tensor $\\mathbf{D}$, and its skew-symmetric part, the spin tensor $\\mathbf{W}$.\n\nThe rate of deformation tensor is defined as $\\mathbf{D} = \\frac{1}{2}(\\mathbf{L} + \\mathbf{L}^T)$. Its matrix representation is:\n$$ \\mathbf{D} = \\frac{1}{2} \\left[ \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & \\dot{\\gamma} & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} + \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ \\dot{\\gamma} & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\right] = \\frac{1}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & \\dot{\\gamma} & 0 \\\\ \\dot{\\gamma} & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} $$\nThe non-zero components are $D_{12} = D_{21} = \\frac{\\dot{\\gamma}}{2}$. Note that the trace of $\\mathbf{D}$ is $\\mathrm{tr}(\\mathbf{D}) = D_{11}+D_{22}+D_{33}=0$, which is consistent with the given condition of an incompressible continuum ($\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{v} = \\mathrm{tr}(\\mathbf{D}) = 0$).\n\nThe spin tensor is defined as $\\mathbf{W} = \\frac{1}{2}(\\mathbf{L} - \\mathbf{L}^T)$.

A fundamental consequence of the local balance of angular momentum for such a continuum is that the Cauchy stress tensor must be symmetric, i.e., $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma} = \\boldsymbol{\\sigma}^T$ or in component form, $\\sigma_{ij} = \\sigma_{ji}$.\n\nWe now examine the term $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma} : \\mathbf{W}$. This is the double-dot product of a symmetric tensor ($\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}$) and a skew-symmetric tensor ($\\mathbf{W}$). This product is identically zero. To prove this, we write the product in component form:\n$$ \\boldsymbol{\\sigma} : \\mathbf{W} = \\sigma_{ij} W_{ij} $$\nUsing the properties of symmetry for $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}$ ($\\sigma_{ij} = \\sigma_{ji}$) and skew-symmetry for $\\mathbf{W}$ ($W_{ij} = -W_{ji}$), we have:\n$$ \\sigma_{ij} W_{ij} = \\sigma_{ji} (-W_{ji}) $$\nBy relabeling the summation indices ($i \\leftrightarrow j$), the expression on the right becomes:\n$$ -\\sigma_{ij}W_{ij} $$\nTherefore, we have the equality $\\sigma_{ij}W_{ij} = -\\sigma_{ij}W_{ij}$, which implies $2 \\sigma_{ij}W_{ij} = 0$, and thus $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}:\\mathbf{W} = 0$.\n\nThis result demonstrates that for a classical Cauchy continuum, the spin tensor $\\mathbf{W}$ does not contribute to the internal power density. The entire stress power is due to the rate of deformation tensor $\\mathbf{D}$. Thus, only the symmetric part of the velocity gradient, $\\mathbf{D}$, contributes to the internal power.\n$$ \\mathcal{P}_{int} = \\boldsymbol{\\sigma} : \\mathbf{D} $$\n\n**Step 3: Derivation of the Final Expression**\n\nUsing the conclusion from Step 2, we now compute the internal power per unit volume by calculating $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}:\\mathbf{D}$. In component form:\n$$ \\boldsymbol{\\sigma}:\\mathbf{D} = \\sum_{i,j} \\sigma_{ij} D_{ij} $$\nFrom Step 1, the only non-zero components of $\\mathbf{D}$ are $D_{12}$ and $D_{21}$. The expansion of the sum reduces to:\n$$ \\boldsymbol{\\sigma}:\\mathbf{D} = \\sigma_{12} D_{12} + \\sigma_{21} D_{21} $$\nSubstituting the values $D_{12} = \\frac{\\dot{\\gamma}}{2}$ and $D_{21} = \\frac{\\dot{\\gamma}}{2}$:\n$$ \\boldsymbol{\\sigma}:\\mathbf{D} = \\sigma_{12} \\left(\\frac{\\dot{\\gamma}}{2}\\right) + \\sigma_{21} \\left(\\frac{\\dot{\\gamma}}{2}\\right) $$\nAs established from the balance of angular momentum, the stress tensor is symmetric, so $\\sigma_{12} = \\sigma_{21}$.Substituting this into the expression gives:\n$$ \\boldsymbol{\\sigma}:\\mathbf{D} = \\sigma_{12} \\left(\\frac{\\dot{\\gamma}}{2}\\right) + \\sigma_{12} \\left(\\frac{\\dot{\\gamma}}{2}\\right) = 2 \\sigma_{12} \\left(\\frac{\\dot{\\gamma}}{2}\\right) = \\sigma_{12} \\dot{\\gamma} $$\nAlternatively, one could use the notation $\\sigma_{xy}$ for $\\sigma_{12}$, yielding $\\sigma_{xy} \\dot{\\gamma}$. Both are equivalent. The final expression for the internal power per unit volume is therefore $\\sigma_{12}\\dot{\\gamma}$. The units are stress $(\\mathrm{N\\,m^{-2}})$ times rate $(\\mathrm{s^{-1}})$, which gives $\\mathrm{N\\,m^{-2}\\,s^{-1}} = (\\mathrm{J\\,m^{-1}})\\,\\mathrm{m^{-2}\\,s^{-1}} = \\mathrm{J\\,m^{-3}\\,s^{-1}} = \\mathrm{W\\,m^{-3}}$, as required.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\sigma_{12}\\dot{\\gamma}}$$", "id": "2691176"}, {"introduction": "The mechanical power supplied to a material must be accounted for by the laws of thermodynamics, which dictate its fate as either stored energy or dissipated heat.

Therefore, I will proceed with the solution.\n\nSolution:\n\nThe solution is constructed in three parts as requested by the problem statement.\n\nPart 1: Derivation of the dissipation rate $D(t)$ and proof of non-negativity.\n\nThe internal dissipation rate per unit volume, $D(t)$, is defined as:\n$$D(t) = \\sigma(t)\\,\\dot{\\varepsilon}(t) - \\dot{\\psi}(t)$$\nFirst, we find the material time derivative of the Helmholtz free energy, $\\dot{\\psi}(t)$. The free energy is given as $\\psi(\\varepsilon) = \\frac{1}{2} E\\,\\varepsilon^{2}$. Using the chain rule for differentiation with respect to time $t$:\n$$\\dot{\\psi}(t) = \\frac{d\\psi}{d\\varepsilon} \\frac{d\\varepsilon}{dt} = \\left(\\frac{d}{d\\varepsilon} \\left(\\frac{1}{2} E\\,\\varepsilon^{2}\\right)\\right) \\dot{\\varepsilon}(t) = (E\\,\\varepsilon(t))\\,\\dot{\\varepsilon}(t)$$\nNext, we substitute the constitutive equation for stress, $\\sigma(t) = E\\,\\varepsilon(t) + \\eta\\,\\dot{\\varepsilon}(t)$, and the expression for $\\dot{\\psi}(t)$ into the definition of $D(t)$:\n$$D(t) = \\left(E\\,\\varepsilon(t) + \\eta\\,\\dot{\\varepsilon}(t)\\right)\\,\\dot{\\varepsilon}(t) - \\left(E\\,\\varepsilon(t)\\,\\dot{\\varepsilon}(t)\\right)$$\nExpanding the first term gives:\n$$D(t) = E\\,\\varepsilon(t)\\,\\dot{\\varepsilon}(t) + \\eta\\,\\left(\\dot{\\varepsilon}(t)\\right)^{2} - E\\,\\varepsilon(t)\\,\\dot{\\varepsilon}(t)$$\nThe terms involving the Young's modulus $E$ cancel, leaving the final expression for the dissipation rate:\n$$D(t) = \\eta\\,\\left(\\dot{\\varepsilon}(t)\\right)^{2}$$\nThis is the explicit expression for $D(t)$ in terms of $\\dot{\\varepsilon}(t)$ and $\\eta$. The physical meaning is clear: for a Kelvin-Voigt material, dissipation is solely due to the viscous part of the stress.\n\nTo show that $D(t)$ is nonnegative for all times, we analyze this expression. The viscosity $\\eta$ is a physical material constant representing resistance to flow, and for passive materials, it must be non-negative, i.e., $\\eta \\ge 0$. The term $(\\dot{\\varepsilon}(t))^{2}$ is the square of the strain rate, which is a real-valued function of time. The square of any real number is always non-negative. Therefore, the product of two non-negative quantities is also non-negative:\n$$D(t) = \\eta\\,\\left(\\dot{\\varepsilon}(t)\\right)^{2} \\ge 0 \\quad \\text{for all } t$$\nThis satisfies the Clausius–Duhem inequality, confirming the thermodynamic consistency of the Kelvin–Voigt model.\n\nPart 2: Derivation of the dissipated energy per cycle, $W_{\\mathrm{diss}}$.\n\nThe energy dissipated per unit volume over one cycle of duration $T = 1/f$ is given by the integral:\n$$W_{\\mathrm{diss}} = \\int_{0}^{T} D(t)\\,dt = \\int_{0}^{1/f} \\eta\\,\\left(\\dot{\\varepsilon}(t)\\right)^{2}\\,dt$$\nFirst, we must determine the strain rate, $\\dot{\\varepsilon}(t)$, from the prescribed strain function $\\varepsilon(t) = \\varepsilon_{0}\\,\\sin(2\\pi f\\,t)$:\n$$\\dot{\\varepsilon}(t) = \\frac{d}{dt} \\left(\\varepsilon_{0}\\,\\sin(2\\pi f\\,t)\\right) = 2\\pi f\\,\\varepsilon_{0}\\,\\cos(2\\pi f\\,t)$$\nNow, substitute this expression for $\\dot{\\varepsilon}(t)$ into the integral for $W_{\\mathrm{diss}}$:\n$$W_{\\mathrm{diss}} = \\int_{0}^{1/f} \\eta\\,\\left(2\\pi f\\,\\varepsilon_{0}\\,\\cos(2\\pi f\\,t)\\right)^{2}\\,dt$$\n$$W_{\\mathrm{diss}} = \\int_{0}^{1/f} \\eta\\,(2\\pi f\\,\\varepsilon_{0})^{2}\\,\\cos^{2}(2\\pi f\\,t)\\,dt$$\nThe terms $\\eta$, $(2\\pi f\\,\\varepsilon_{0})^{2}$ are constants with respect to time, so they can be moved outside the integral:\n$$W_{\\mathrm{diss}} = 4\\pi^{2} f^{2} \\varepsilon_{0}^{2} \\eta \\int_{0}^{1/f} \\cos^{2}(2\\pi f\\,t)\\,dt$$\nTo evaluate the integral, we use the trigonometric identity $\\cos^{2}(\\theta) = \\frac{1}{2}(1 + \\cos(2\\theta))$. Let $\\theta = 2\\pi f\\,t$.\n$$\\int_{0}^{1/f} \\cos^{2}(2\\pi f\\,t)\\,dt = \\int_{0}^{1/f} \\frac{1}{2}\\left(1 + \\cos(4\\pi f\\,t)\\right)\\,dt$$\n$$= \\frac{1}{2} \\left[ \\int_{0}^{1/f} 1\\,dt + \\int_{0}^{1/f} \\cos(4\\pi f\\,t)\\,dt \\right]$$\nThe first integral is $\\int_{0}^{1/f} 1\\,dt = [t]_{0}^{1/f} = 1/f$.\nThe second integral is $\\int_{0}^{1/f} \\cos(4\\pi f\\,t)\\,dt = \\left[\\frac{\\sin(4\\pi f\\,t)}{4\\pi f}\\right]_{0}^{1/f} = \\frac{\\sin(4\\pi) - \\sin(0)}{4\\pi f} = \\frac{0 - 0}{4\\pi f} = 0$.\nThus, the value of the integral is:\n$$\\int_{0}^{1/f} \\cos^{2}(2\\pi f\\,t)\\,dt = \\frac{1}{2} \\left(\\frac{1}{f} + 0\\right) = \\frac{1}{2f}$$\nSubstituting this result back into the expression for $W_{\\mathrm{diss}}$:\n$$W_{\\mathrm{diss}} = 4\\pi^{2} f^{2} \\varepsilon_{0}^{2} \\eta \\left(\\frac{1}{2f}\\right)$$\nSimplifying the expression yields the final closed-form result for the dissipated energy per cycle:\n$$W_{\\mathrm{diss}} = 2\\pi^{2} f \\varepsilon_{0}^{2} \\eta$$\nThis expression depends only on the required parameters $\\varepsilon_{0}$, $f$, and $\\eta$.\n\nPart 3: Numerical evaluation of $W_{\\mathrm{diss}}$.\n\nWe use the derived formula and substitute the given numerical values:\n- $f = 2.0$ Hz\n- $\\varepsilon_{0} = 0.010$ (dimensionless)\n- $\\eta = 5.0 \\times 10^{7}$ Pa$\\cdot$s\n\n$$W_{\\mathrm{diss}} = 2\\pi^{2} (2.0) (0.010)^{2} (5.0 \\times 10^{7})$$\nThe units are $(\\text{s}^{-1}) \\cdot (\\text{dimensionless})^{2} \\cdot (\\text{Pa}\\cdot\\text{s}) = \\text{Pa} = \\text{N/m}^{2} = \\text{J/m}^{3}$.\nNow, we compute the numerical value:\n$$W_{\\mathrm{diss}} = 2\\pi^{2} \\times (2.0) \\times (1.0 \\times 10^{-2})^{2} \\times (5.0 \\times 10^{7})$$\n$$W_{\\mathrm{diss}} = 2\\pi^{2} \\times (2.0) \\times (1.0 \\times 10^{-4}) \\times (5.0 \\times 10^{7})$$\n$$W_{\\mathrm{diss}} = (2 \\times 2.0 \\times 5.0) \\times \\pi^{2} \\times 10^{-4} \\times 10^{7}$$\n$$W_{\\mathrm{diss}} = 20.0 \\times \\pi^{2} \\times 10^{3} = 2.0 \\times 10^{4} \\times \\pi^{2} \\text{ J/m}^{3}$$\nUsing the value $\\pi \\approx 3.14159265$, we have $\\pi^{2} \\approx 9.8696044$.\n$$W_{\\mathrm{diss}} = 2.0 \\times 10^{4} \\times 9.8696044 \\text{ J/m}^{3} \\approx 197392.09 \\text{ J/m}^{3}$$\nThe problem requires the answer in kilojoules per cubic meter (kJ/m$^3$).
