I will now proceed with a complete solution.\n\nThe solution is developed in three parts as requested.\n\n1) Computation of $\\boldsymbol{C}, \\boldsymbol{B}, \\boldsymbol{U}, \\boldsymbol{V}$:\nThe deformation gradient $\\boldsymbol{F}$ is given as a diagonal matrix in the orthonormal basis $\\{e_1, e_2, e_3\\}$:\n$$\n\\boldsymbol{F} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\lambda_1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & \\lambda_2 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & \\lambda_3 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nSince $\\boldsymbol{F}$ is a diagonal matrix, its transpose $\\boldsymbol{F}^{\\mathsf{T}}$ is identical to $\\boldsymbol{F}$:\n$$\n\\boldsymbol{F}^{\\mathsf{T}} = \\boldsymbol{F} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\lambda_1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & \\lambda_2 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & \\lambda_3 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe right Cauchy-Green tensor $\\boldsymbol{C}$ is computed as $\\boldsymbol{C} = \\boldsymbol{F}^{\\mathsf{T}}\\boldsymbol{F}$. Given $\\boldsymbol{F}^{\\mathsf{T}}=\\boldsymbol{F}$, this simplifies to $\\boldsymbol{C}=\\boldsymbol{F}^2$:\n$$\n\\boldsymbol{C} = \\boldsymbol{F}^2 = \\begin{pmatrix} \\lambda_1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & \\lambda_2 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & \\lambda_3 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} \\lambda_1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & \\lambda_2 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & \\lambda_3 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\lambda_1^2 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & \\lambda_2^2 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & \\lambda_3^2 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nSimilarly, the left Cauchy-Green tensor $\\boldsymbol{B}$ is computed as $\\boldsymbol{B} = \\boldsymbol{F}\\boldsymbol{F}^{\\mathsf{T}}$. Since $\\boldsymbol{F}=\\boldsymbol{F}^{\\mathsf{T}}$, we find that $\\boldsymbol{B}=\\boldsymbol{C}$:\n$$\n\\boldsymbol{B} = \\boldsymbol{F}\\boldsymbol{F}^{\\mathsf{T}} = \\boldsymbol{F}^2 = \\begin{pmatrix} \\lambda_1^2 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & \\lambda_2^2 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & \\lambda_3^2 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nNext, we determine the right stretch tensor $\\boldsymbol{U} = \\boldsymbol{C}^{1/2}$ and the left stretch tensor $\\boldsymbol{V} = \\boldsymbol{B}^{1/2}$. By definition, $\\boldsymbol{U}$ and $\\boldsymbol{V}$ are the unique positive-definite square roots of $\\boldsymbol{C}$ and $\\boldsymbol{B}$, respectively. For a symmetric positive-definite tensor that is diagonal in a given basis, say $D = \\operatorname{diag}(d_1, d_2, d_3)$ with $d_i > 0$, its unique positive-definite square root is also diagonal, given by $D^{1/2} = \\operatorname{diag}(\\sqrt{d_1}, \\sqrt{d_2}, \\sqrt{d_3})$. The tensor $\\boldsymbol{C}$ is symmetric and diagonal. Its diagonal entries are $\\lambda_i^2$. Since it is given that $\\lambda_i > 0$, we have $\\lambda_i^2 > 0$, which confirms that $\\boldsymbol{C}$ is positive-definite.\nApplying this property to $\\boldsymbol{C}$, we find $\\boldsymbol{U}$:\n$$\n\\boldsymbol{U} = \\boldsymbol{C}^{1/2} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\sqrt{\\lambda_1^2} & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & \\sqrt{\\lambda_2^2} & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & \\sqrt{\\lambda_3^2} \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nSince $\\lambda_i > 0$, we have $\\sqrt{\\lambda_i^2} = \\lambda_i$. Therefore,\n$$\n\\boldsymbol{U} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\lambda_1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & \\lambda_2 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & \\lambda_3 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nSince $\\boldsymbol{B}=\\boldsymbol{C}$, their unique positive-definite square roots must be identical, so $\\boldsymbol{V}=\\boldsymbol{U}$. We note that $\\boldsymbol{U}=\\boldsymbol{V}=\\boldsymbol{F}$. The polar decomposition $\\boldsymbol{F}=\\boldsymbol{R}\\boldsymbol{U}$ thus requires $\\boldsymbol{R}$ to be the identity tensor $\\boldsymbol{I}$, as $\\boldsymbol{F}=\\boldsymbol{I}\\boldsymbol{F}$. The identity tensor $\\boldsymbol{I}$ is indeed an orthogonal tensor ($\\boldsymbol{I}^{\\mathsf{T}}\\boldsymbol{I} = \\boldsymbol{I}$), so this is consistent. A pure stretch corresponds to a deformation with no rotation.\n\n2) Principal Stretches and Directions:\nThe principal stretches are the eigenvalues of the right stretch tensor $\\boldsymbol{U}$, and the principal directions are the corresponding eigenvectors. We have found that $\\boldsymbol{U} = \\operatorname{diag}(\\lambda_1, \\lambda_2, \\lambda_3)$.\nThe eigenvalue problem for $\\boldsymbol{U}$ is $\\boldsymbol{U}\\mathbf{x} = \\mu\\mathbf{x}$, where $\\mu$ is an eigenvalue and $\\mathbf{x}$ is the corresponding eigenvector. In matrix form:\n$$\n\\begin{pmatrix} \\lambda_1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & \\lambda_2 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & \\lambda_3 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} x_1 \\\\ x_2 \\\\ x_3 \\end{pmatrix} = \\mu \\begin{pmatrix} x_1 \\\\ x_2 \\\\ x_3 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThis is equivalent to the system of equations $( \\lambda_i - \\mu ) x_i = 0$ for $i=1,2,3$. For a non-trivial solution $\\mathbf{x} \\neq \\mathbf{0}$, the determinant of the matrix $(\\boldsymbol{U} - \\mu \\boldsymbol{I})$ must be zero: $\\det(\\boldsymbol{U} - \\mu \\boldsymbol{I}) = (\\lambda_1 - \\mu)(\\lambda_2 - \\mu)(\\lambda_3 - \\mu) = 0$.\nThe solutions for $\\mu$, which are the eigenvalues, are precisely $\\mu_1=\\lambda_1$, $\\mu_2=\\lambda_2$, and $\\mu_3=\\lambda_3$. These are the principal stretches.\nThe corresponding eigenvectors are found by substituting each eigenvalue back into the eigenvalue equation.\n- For $\\mu = \\lambda_1$: The equation becomes $(\\lambda_1 - \\lambda_1)x_1=0$, $(\\lambda_2 - \\lambda_1)x_2=0$, and $(\\lambda_3 - \\lambda_1)x_3=0$. If all $\\lambda_i$ are distinct, this forces $x_2=0$ and $x_3=0$, leaving $x_1$ arbitrary. The eigenvector is any non-zero multiple of $(1, 0, 0)^{\\mathsf{T}}$, which is the basis vector $e_1$.\n- For $\\mu = \\lambda_2$: Similarly, the eigenvector is $e_2$.\n- For $\\mu = \\lambda_3$: The eigenvector is $e_3$.\nIf any principal stretches are equal (e.g., $\\lambda_1=\\lambda_2$), the corresponding eigenspace is multi-dimensional. For instance, if $\\lambda_1=\\lambda_2$, any vector in the plane spanned by $\\{e_1, e_2\\}$ is an eigenvector for the eigenvalue $\\lambda_1$. Regardless, the set $\\{e_1, e_2, e_3\\}$ remains a valid orthonormal basis of eigenvectors for $\\boldsymbol{U}$.\nThus, $\\boldsymbol{U}$ and $\\boldsymbol{V}$ are diagonal in the same basis as $\\boldsymbol{F}$, their eigenvectors coincide with the coordinate basis vectors $\\{e_i\\}$, and the principal stretches are $\\lambda_1, \\lambda_2, \\lambda_3$.\n\n3) Special Cases:\n- Biaxial stretch: This case is defined by $\\lambda_3=1$, with $\\lambda_1>0$ and $\\lambda_2>0$ being arbitrary. Applying the general result from part 2), the principal stretches are the diagonal elements of $\\boldsymbol{F}$, so they are $\\lambda_1, \\lambda_2, 1$.\n- Isochoric pure shear in the $e_1-e_2$ plane: This case is defined by the conditions $\\det \\boldsymbol{F}=1$, $\\lambda_3=1$, and $\\lambda_1>0$. The determinant of $\\boldsymbol{F}=\\operatorname{diag}(\\lambda_1, \\lambda_2, \\lambda_3)$ is $\\det \\boldsymbol{F} = \\lambda_1 \\lambda_2 \\lambda_3$. With $\\det \\boldsymbol{F}=1$ and $\\lambda_3=1$, we have $\\lambda_1 \\lambda_2 (1) = 1$, which implies $\\lambda_2 = \\frac{1}{\\lambda_1}$. Since $\\lambda_1 > 0$, it follows that $\\lambda_2 > 0$. The deformation gradient is $\\boldsymbol{F} = \\operatorname{diag}(\\lambda_1, 1/\\lambda_1, 1)$. The principal stretches are therefore $\\lambda_1, \\frac{1}{\\lambda_1}, 1$.\n\nThe final answer requested is the ordered triple of principal stretches for the general case, expressed in terms of $\\lambda_1, \\lambda_2, \\lambda_3$.

It consists of two parts: a derivation of principal strain expressions and a subsequent numerical calculation. We will address each part in sequence.\n\nPart 1: Derivation of Principal Strains\n\nThe principal stretches, denoted by $\\lambda_i$ where $i \\in \\{1, 2, 3\\}$, are the positive singular values of the deformation gradient tensor $\\boldsymbol{F}$. This is directly related to the polar decomposition theorem, which states that $\\boldsymbol{F}$ can be decomposed as $\\boldsymbol{F} = \\boldsymbol{R}\\boldsymbol{U} = \\boldsymbol{V}\\boldsymbol{R}$, where $\\boldsymbol{R}$ is a proper orthogonal tensor representing a rotation, and $\\boldsymbol{U}$ and $\\boldsymbol{V}$ are the symmetric, positive-definite right and left stretch tensors, respectively. The eigenvalues of both $\\boldsymbol{U}$ and $\\boldsymbol{V}$ are the principal stretches $\\lambda_i$. The corresponding eigenvectors define the principal directions of stretch in the reference (for $\\boldsymbol{U}$) and current (for $\\boldsymbol{V}$) configurations.\n\nFirst, we derive the expression for the principal values of the Green–Lagrange strain tensor, $\\boldsymbol{E}$. The tensor $\\boldsymbol{E}$ is defined with respect to the reference configuration. Its definition involves the right Cauchy–Green deformation tensor $\\boldsymbol{C} = \\boldsymbol{F}^{\\mathsf{T}}\\boldsymbol{F}$. Using the polar decomposition $\\boldsymbol{F} = \\boldsymbol{R}\\boldsymbol{U}$, we can express $\\boldsymbol{C}$ as:\n$$\n\\boldsymbol{C} = (\\boldsymbol{R}\\boldsymbol{U})^{\\mathsf{T}}(\\boldsymbol{R}\\boldsymbol{U}) = \\boldsymbol{U}^{\\mathsf{T}}\\boldsymbol{R}^{\\mathsf{T}}\\boldsymbol{R}\\boldsymbol{U}\n$$\nGiven that $\\boldsymbol{R}$ is orthogonal, $\\boldsymbol{R}^{\\mathsf{T}}\\boldsymbol{R} = \\boldsymbol{I}$, where $\\boldsymbol{I}$ is the second-order identity tensor. Since $\\boldsymbol{U}$ is symmetric, $\\boldsymbol{U}^{\\mathsf{T}} = \\boldsymbol{U}$. Therefore, the expression for $\\boldsymbol{C}$ simplifies to:\n$$\n\\boldsymbol{C} = \\boldsymbol{U}\\boldsymbol{I}\\boldsymbol{U} = \\boldsymbol{U}^2\n$$\nThis result shows that $\\boldsymbol{C}$ and $\\boldsymbol{U}$ are coaxial, meaning they share the same principal directions (eigenvectors). If $\\boldsymbol{N}_i$ is an eigenvector of $\\boldsymbol{U}$ corresponding to the eigenvalue $\\lambda_i$, then $\\boldsymbol{U}\\boldsymbol{N}_i = \\lambda_i\\boldsymbol{N}_i$. Consequently, the action of $\\boldsymbol{C}$ on $\\boldsymbol{N}_i$ is:\n$$\n\\boldsymbol{C}\\boldsymbol{N}_i = \\boldsymbol{U}^2\\boldsymbol{N}_i = \\boldsymbol{U}(\\boldsymbol{U}\\boldsymbol{N}_i) = \\boldsymbol{U}(\\lambda_i\\boldsymbol{N}_i) = \\lambda_i(\\boldsymbol{U}\\boldsymbol{N}_i) = \\lambda_i(\\lambda_i\\boldsymbol{N}_i) = \\lambda_i^2\\boldsymbol{N}_i\n$$\nThus, the principal values of $\\boldsymbol{C}$ are $\\lambda_i^2$.\nNow, consider the Green–Lagrange strain tensor, $\\boldsymbol{E} = \\frac{1}{2}(\\boldsymbol{C} - \\boldsymbol{I})$. The principal values of $\\boldsymbol{E}$, denoted $E_i$, are its eigenvalues. Since $\\boldsymbol{E}$ is a linear function of $\\boldsymbol{C}$, it is also coaxial with $\\boldsymbol{C}$ and $\\boldsymbol{U}$. The eigenvalues $E_i$ are found by applying $\\boldsymbol{E}$ to the principal directions $\\boldsymbol{N}_i$:\n$$\n\\boldsymbol{E}\\boldsymbol{N}_i = \\frac{1}{2}(\\boldsymbol{C} - \\boldsymbol{I})\\boldsymbol{N}_i = \\frac{1}{2}(\\boldsymbol{C}\\boldsymbol{N}_i - \\boldsymbol{I}\\boldsymbol{N}_i) = \\frac{1}{2}(\\lambda_i^2\\boldsymbol{N}_i - \\boldsymbol{N}_i) = \\frac{1}{2}(\\lambda_i^2 - 1)\\boldsymbol{N}_i\n$$\nFrom this, we identify the principal values of the Green–Lagrange strain tensor as:\n$$\nE_i = \\frac{1}{2}(\\lambda_i^2 - 1)\n$$\n\nNext, we derive the expression for the principal values of the Almansi strain tensor, $\\boldsymbol{e}$. This tensor is defined with respect to the current configuration via the relation $\\boldsymbol{e} = \\frac{1}{2}(\\boldsymbol{I} - \\boldsymbol{b}^{-1})$, where $\\boldsymbol{b}$ is the left Cauchy–Green deformation tensor, $\\boldsymbol{b} = \\boldsymbol{F}\\boldsymbol{F}^{\\mathsf{T}}$. Using the polar decomposition $\\boldsymbol{F} = \\boldsymbol{V}\\boldsymbol{R}$:\n$$\n\\boldsymbol{b} = (\\boldsymbol{V}\\boldsymbol{R})(\\boldsymbol{V}\\boldsymbol{R})^{\\mathsf{T}} = \\boldsymbol{V}\\boldsymbol{R}\\boldsymbol{R}^{\\mathsf{T}}\\boldsymbol{V}^{\\mathsf{T}}\n$$\nSince $\\boldsymbol{R}\\boldsymbol{R}^{\\mathsf{T}} = \\boldsymbol{I}$ and $\\boldsymbol{V}^{\\mathsf{T}} = \\boldsymbol{V}$, this simplifies to:\n$$\n\\boldsymbol{b} = \\boldsymbol{V}\\boldsymbol{I}\\boldsymbol{V} = \\boldsymbol{V}^2\n$$\nSimilar to the previous case, $\\boldsymbol{b}$ and $\\boldsymbol{V}$ are coaxial. The principal values of $\\boldsymbol{b}$ are the squares of the principal values of $\\boldsymbol{V}$, which are the principal stretches $\\lambda_i$. Thus, the eigenvalues of $\\boldsymbol{b}$ are $\\lambda_i^2$. The principal values of the inverse tensor $\\boldsymbol{b}^{-1}$ are the reciprocals of the principal values of $\\boldsymbol{b}$, which are $\\lambda_i^{-2}$. The principal directions of $\\boldsymbol{b}$ and $\\boldsymbol{e}$, denoted $\\mathbf{n}_i$, are the eigenvectors of $\\boldsymbol{V}$.\nThe principal values of $\\boldsymbol{e}$, denoted $e_i$, are its eigenvalues. Applying $\\boldsymbol{e}$ to its principal directions $\\mathbf{n}_i$:\n$$\n\\boldsymbol{e}\\mathbf{n}_i = \\frac{1}{2}(\\boldsymbol{I} - \\boldsymbol{b}^{-1})\\mathbf{n}_i = \\frac{1}{2}(\\boldsymbol{I}\\mathbf{n}_i - \\boldsymbol{b}^{-1}\\mathbf{n}_i) = \\frac{1}{2}(\\mathbf{n}_i - \\lambda_i^{-2}\\mathbf{n}_i) = \\frac{1}{2}(1 - \\lambda_i^{-2})\\mathbf{n}_i\n$$\nThe principal values of the Almansi strain tensor are therefore:\n$$\ne_i = \\frac{1}{2}(1 - \\lambda_i^{-2})\n$$\nThis completes the required derivations.\n\nPart 2: Numerical Calculation\n\nWe are asked to compute the scalar quantity $S = \\sum_{i=1}^{3} E_i e_i$ for a deformation with principal stretches $\\lambda_1 = 1.3$, $\\lambda_2 = 0.8$, and $\\lambda_3 = 1.1$.\nFirst, let us find a general expression for the product $E_i e_i$:\n$$\nE_i e_i = \\left(\\frac{1}{2}(\\lambda_i^2 - 1)\\right) \\left(\\frac{1}{2}(1 - \\lambda_i^{-2})\\right) = \\frac{1}{4}(\\lambda_i^2 - 1)\\left(1 - \\frac{1}{\\lambda_i^2}\\right)\n$$\n$$\nE_i e_i = \\frac{1}{4}(\\lambda_i^2 - 1)\\left(\\frac{\\lambda_i^2 - 1}{\\lambda_i^2}\\right) = \\frac{1}{4}\\frac{(\\lambda_i^2 - 1)^2}{\\lambda_i^2}\n$$\nNow we substitute the given numerical values for each principal stretch.\n\nFor $\\lambda_1 = 1.3$:\n$$\nE_1 e_1 = \\frac{1}{4}\\frac{(1.3^2 - 1)^2}{1.3^2} = \\frac{1}{4}\\frac{(1.69 - 1)^2}{1.69} = \\frac{1}{4}\\frac{0.69^2}{1.69} = \\frac{1}{4}\\frac{0.4761}{1.69} \\approx 0.070428994\n$$\nFor $\\lambda_2 = 0.8$:\n$$\nE_2 e_2 = \\frac{1}{4}\\frac{(0.8^2 - 1)^2}{0.8^2} = \\frac{1}{4}\\frac{(0.64 - 1)^2}{0.64} = \\frac{1}{4}\\frac{(-0.36)^2}{0.64} = \\frac{1}{4}\\frac{0.1296}{0.64} = 0.050625\n$$\nFor $\\lambda_3 = 1.1$:\n$$\nE_3 e_3 = \\frac{1}{4}\\frac{(1.1^2 - 1)^2}{1.1^2} = \\frac{1}{4}\\frac{(1.21 - 1)^2}{1.21} = \\frac{1}{4}\\frac{0.21^2}{1.21} = \\frac{1}{4}\\frac{0.0441}{1.21} \\approx 0.009111570\n$$\nThe scalar $S$ is the sum of these values:\n$$\nS = \\sum_{i=1}^{3} E_i e_i = E_1 e_1 + E_2 e_2 + E_3 e_3\n$$\n$$\nS \\approx 0.070428994 + 0.050625 + 0.009111570 = 0.130165564\n$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to six significant figures.

Both pipelines have leading-order $\\mathcal{O}(n^3)$ cost for dense $n \\times n$ inputs; forming $\\boldsymbol{C}$ adds a matrix–matrix multiply. Symmetric eigenvalue decomposition has a smaller constant factor than a full SVD. Forming $\\boldsymbol{C} = \\boldsymbol{F}^{\\mathsf{T}} \\boldsymbol{F}$ squares the spectral condition number, so for the smallest $\\lambda_i$, the relative error scales like $\\mathcal{O}(\\kappa_2(\\boldsymbol{F})^2 u)$ via the $\\boldsymbol{C}$-eigen route, versus $\\mathcal{O}(\\kappa_2(\\boldsymbol{F}) u)$ via direct SVD. Hence, for $\\kappa_2(\\boldsymbol{F}) \\approx 3$, either route is acceptable and the $\\boldsymbol{C}$-eigen route can be faster, especially if $\\boldsymbol{C}$ is already available or only invariants are needed; for $\\kappa_2(\\boldsymbol{F}) \\approx 10^8$, prefer SVD to avoid the squaring of the condition number and possible overflow/underflow, and also if orthogonal factors are needed.\n\nB. The $\\boldsymbol{C}$-eigen route has $\\mathcal{O}(n^2)$ cost while SVD is $\\mathcal{O}(n^3)$. Because $\\boldsymbol{C}$ is symmetric, its eigen-decomposition is always more numerically stable, so it should be preferred regardless of conditioning.\n\nC. Both pipelines have leading-order $\\mathcal{O}(n^3)$ cost; forming $\\boldsymbol{C}$ is negligible. The relative error in the smallest $\\lambda_i$ scales as $\\mathcal{O}(\\kappa_2(\\boldsymbol{F}) u)$ for both routes, so stability is essentially the same; implementation convenience should drive the choice.\n\nD. SVD requires $\\mathcal{O}(n^4)$ operations while the $\\boldsymbol{C}$-eigen route is $\\mathcal{O}(n^3)$. The SVD is less stable for small singular values, so for severely ill-conditioned $\\boldsymbol{F}$ it is better to compute $\\lambda_i$ from $\\boldsymbol{C}$.", "solution": "The analysis of this problem proceeds in stages. First, the problem statement itself must be validated for scientific and logical integrity. Only upon confirmation of its validity can a solution be systematically derived.\n\n### Problem Validation\n\n**Step 1: Extract Givens**\n\nThe problem provides the following information and definitions:\n-   **Quantities**: Principal stretches $\\lambda_i$, deformation gradient $\\boldsymbol{F} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{3 \\times 3}$.\n-   **Pipeline (i)**: Compute the right Cauchy–Green tensor $\\boldsymbol{C} = \\boldsymbol{F}^{\\mathsf{T}} \\boldsymbol{F}$, find its eigenvalues $\\mu_i$, and set $\\lambda_i = \\sqrt{\\mu_i}$.\n-   **Pipeline (ii)**: Compute the singular value decomposition (SVD) of $\\boldsymbol{F}$ as $\\boldsymbol{F} = \\boldsymbol{U} \\boldsymbol{\\Sigma} \\boldsymbol{V}^{\\mathsf{T}}$ where $\\boldsymbol{U}, \\boldsymbol{V}$ are orthogonal and $\\boldsymbol{\\Sigma} = \\mathrm{diag}(\\sigma_1, \\sigma_2, \\sigma_3)$, and set $\\lambda_i = \\sigma_i$.\n-   **Numerical Assumptions**:\n    -   Algorithms for symmetric eigenvalue problems and SVD are backward stable.\n    -   Machine roundoff is $u$.\n    -   Spectral norm condition number is $\\kappa_2(\\boldsymbol{F}) = \\|\\boldsymbol{F}\\|_2 \\|\\boldsymbol{F}^{-1}\\|_2$.\n    -   Perturbation bound for symmetric eigenvalues: $|\\delta \\mu_i| \\le \\|\\delta \\boldsymbol{C}\\|_2$.\n    -   Perturbation bound for singular values: $|\\delta \\sigma_i| \\le \\|\\delta \\boldsymbol{F}\\|_2$.\n-   **Deformation Regimes**:\n    -   Regime 1: Moderately conditioned, $\\kappa_2(\\boldsymbol{F}) \\approx 3$.\n    -   Regime 2: Severely conditioned, $\\kappa_2(\\boldsymbol{F}) \\approx 10^8$.\n-   **Task**: Compare the pipelines on leading-order computational cost and relative error scaling for the smallest principal stretch, and provide a practical recommendation.\n\n**Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens**\n\nThe problem statement is scrutinized against criteria for validity.\n\n-   **Scientific Grounding**: The problem is rooted in fundamental principles of continuum mechanics and numerical linear algebra. The definitions of principal stretches via the right Cauchy-Green tensor and the SVD of the deformation gradient are standard and equivalent.

It is a well-posed, scientifically grounded problem that addresses a critical issue in computational mechanics. I will now proceed with the solution derivation.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe analysis will address three aspects: computational complexity, numerical stability of computing the smallest principal stretch, and practical recommendations. For generality, we consider $\\boldsymbol{F} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n \\times n}$, as is standard for complexity analysis.\n\n**1. Computational Cost**\n\n-   **Pipeline (i): The $\\boldsymbol{C}$-eigenvalue route**\n    1.  Formation of $\\boldsymbol{C} = \\boldsymbol{F}^{\\mathsf{T}} \\boldsymbol{F}$: This involves a multiplication of an $n \\times n$ matrix with an $n \\times n$ matrix. Using the standard algorithm, this has a computational cost of $\\mathcal{O}(n^3)$.\n    2.  Eigenvalue decomposition of $\\boldsymbol{C}$: Since $\\boldsymbol{C}$ is a symmetric matrix, specialized algorithms like the symmetric QR algorithm are used. For a dense $n \\times n$ symmetric matrix, the cost is $\\mathcal{O}(n^3)$.\n    The total leading-order cost for this pipeline is $\\mathcal{O}(n^3) + \\mathcal{O}(n^3) = \\mathcal{O}(n^3)$.\n\n-   **Pipeline (ii): The SVD route**\n    1.  Singular Value Decomposition of $\\boldsymbol{F}$: Standard algorithms to compute the SVD of a general dense $n \\times n$ matrix, such as those based on Golub-Kahan-Reinsch methods, have a computational cost of $\\mathcal{O}(n^3)$.\n    The total leading-order cost is $\\mathcal{O}(n^3)$.\n\n-   **Cost Comparison**: Both pipelines have a leading-order complexity of $\\mathcal{O}(n^3)$. However, the constant factors differ. The formation of $\\boldsymbol{C}$ is an explicit matrix multiplication. The constant factor for a symmetric eigensolver is typically smaller than that for an SVD of a general matrix. The overall speed comparison depends on the specific implementation and matrix size. For the given case of $n=3$, the distinction in complexity class is irrelevant, but the number of floating-point operations matters. The $\\boldsymbol{C}$-eigen route involves two major steps (multiplication and eigensolution), while SVD is one.\n\n**2. Numerical Stability and Error Scaling**\n\nWe analyze the relative error in the smallest principal stretch, $\\lambda_{\\min}$, which is equal to the smallest singular value of $\\boldsymbol{F}$, $\\sigma_{\\min}$.\n\n-   **Pipeline (ii): The SVD route**\n    A backward stable SVD algorithm computes the exact singular values $\\hat{\\sigma}_i$ of a perturbed matrix $\\hat{\\boldsymbol{F}} = \\boldsymbol{F} + \\delta \\boldsymbol{F}$, where $\\|\\delta \\boldsymbol{F}\\|_2 \\le c_1 u \\|\\boldsymbol{F}\\|_2$ for some modest constant $c_1$.\n    Using the given perturbation bound $|\\delta \\sigma_i| \\le \\|\\delta \\boldsymbol{F}\\|_2$, the absolute error in $\\sigma_{\\min}$ is bounded:\n    $$|\\delta \\sigma_{\\min}| = |\\hat{\\sigma}_{\\min} - \\sigma_{\\min}| \\le \\|\\delta \\boldsymbol{F}\\|_2 \\le c_1 u \\|\\boldsymbol{F}\\|_2$$\n    The relative error in the smallest singular value is therefore:\n    $$ \\frac{|\\delta \\sigma_{\\min}|}{\\sigma_{\\min}} \\le \\frac{c_1 u \\|\\boldsymbol{F}\\|_2}{\\sigma_{\\min}} $$\n    By definition, the condition number $\\kappa_2(\\boldsymbol{F}) = \\|\\boldsymbol{F}\\|_2 \\|\\boldsymbol{F}^{-1}\\|_2$. Since $\\|\\boldsymbol{F}^{-1}\\|_2 = 1/\\sigma_{\\min}(\\boldsymbol{F})$, we have $\\kappa_2(\\boldsymbol{F}) = \\|\\boldsymbol{F}\\|_2 / \\sigma_{\\min}$. Substituting this into the error bound gives:\n    $$ \\frac{|\\delta \\sigma_{\\min}|}{\\sigma_{\\min}} \\le c_1 u \\kappa_2(\\boldsymbol{F}) $$\n    Thus, the relative error in the smallest stretch scales as $\\mathcal{O}(\\kappa_2(\\boldsymbol{F}) u)$.\n\n-   **Pipeline (i): The $\\boldsymbol{C}$-eigenvalue route**\n    This route involves two steps where numerical error is introduced.\n    1.  **Forming $\\boldsymbol{C}$**: The floating-point computation of $\\boldsymbol{C} = \\boldsymbol{F}^{\\mathsf{T}} \\boldsymbol{F}$ yields a computed matrix $\\hat{\\boldsymbol{C}}$ that is near the true product: $\\hat{\\boldsymbol{C}} = \\boldsymbol{F}^{\\mathsf{T}} \\boldsymbol{F} + \\delta \\boldsymbol{C}_{mult}$. A standard bound for the multiplication error is $\\|\\delta \\boldsymbol{C}_{mult}\\|_2 \\le c_2 u \\|\\boldsymbol{F}^{\\mathsf{T}}\\|_2 \\|\\boldsymbol{F}\\|_2 = c_2 u \\|\\boldsymbol{F}\\|_2^2$.\n    2.  **Solving for eigenvalues**: A backward stable eigensolver computes the exact eigenvalues $\\hat{\\mu}_i$ of a matrix $\\hat{\\boldsymbol{C}} + \\delta \\boldsymbol{C}_{eig}$, where $\\|\\delta \\boldsymbol{C}_{eig}\\|_2 \\le c_3 u \\|\\hat{\\boldsymbol{C}}\\|_2 \\approx c_3 u \\|\\boldsymbol{C}\\|_2 = c_3 u \\|\\boldsymbol{F}\\|_2^2$.\n    The total perturbation on $\\boldsymbol{C}$ is $\\delta \\boldsymbol{C} = \\delta \\boldsymbol{C}_{mult} + \\delta \\boldsymbol{C}_{eig}$. The norm is bounded by $\\|\\delta \\boldsymbol{C}\\|_2 \\le \\|\\delta \\boldsymbol{C}_{mult}\\|_2 + \\|\\delta \\boldsymbol{C}_{eig}\\|_2 \\lesssim (c_2 + c_3) u \\|\\boldsymbol{F}\\|_2^2$.\n    Using Weyl's theorem for the eigenvalue perturbation, $|\\delta \\mu_i| \\le \\|\\delta \\boldsymbol{C}\\|_2$:\n    $$ |\\delta \\mu_{\\min}| \\lesssim \\mathcal{O}(u \\|\\boldsymbol{F}\\|_2^2) $$\n    We need the error in $\\lambda_{\\min} = \\sqrt{\\mu_{\\min}}$. Using first-order perturbation analysis for the square root function, $\\delta \\lambda = \\frac{1}{2\\sqrt{\\mu}} \\delta \\mu$, the relative error in $\\lambda_{\\min}$ is:\n    $$ \\frac{|\\delta \\lambda_{\\min}|}{\\lambda_{\\min}} = \\frac{|\\delta \\mu_{\\min}|}{2 \\mu_{\\min}} $$\n    Substituting the bound for $|\\delta \\mu_{\\min}|$ and using $\\mu_{\\min} = \\lambda_{\\min}^2 = \\sigma_{\\min}^2$:\n    $$ \\frac{|\\delta \\lambda_{\\min}|}{\\lambda_{\\min}} \\lesssim \\frac{\\mathcal{O}(u \\|\\boldsymbol{F}\\|_2^2)}{2 \\sigma_{\\min}^2} = \\mathcal{O}(u) \\frac{\\|\\boldsymbol{F}\\|_2^2}{\\sigma_{\\min}^2} = \\mathcal{O}(u) \\left(\\frac{\\sigma_{\\max}}{\\sigma_{\\min}}\\right)^2 = \\mathcal{O}(u \\cdot \\kappa_2(\\boldsymbol{F})^2) $$\n    Thus, the relative error in the smallest stretch scales as $\\mathcal{O}(\\kappa_2(\\boldsymbol{F})^2 u)$. The explicit formation of $\\boldsymbol{C} = \\boldsymbol{F}^{\\mathsf{T}} \\boldsymbol{F}$ squares the effective condition number of the problem.\n\n**3. Practical Recommendation**\n\n-   **Regime 1: $\\kappa_2(\\boldsymbol{F}) \\approx 3$**\n    -   SVD route error: $\\mathcal{O}(3u)$.\n    -   $\\boldsymbol{C}$-eigen route error: $\\mathcal{O}(3^2 u) = \\mathcal{O}(9u)$.\n    Both errors are small multiples of machine precision $u$. The accuracy loss from squaring the condition number is minimal and acceptable. The choice can be based on other factors. If $\\boldsymbol{C}$ is already computed for constitutive updates (common in hyperelasticity), or only strain invariants are needed, using the $\\boldsymbol{C}$-eigen route is computationally cheaper. If orthogonal factors $\\boldsymbol{U}, \\boldsymbol{V}$ are needed (e.g., for polar decomposition), SVD is necessary anyway.\n\n-   **Regime 2: $\\kappa_2(\\boldsymbol{F}) \\approx 10^8$**\n    -   SVD route error: $\\mathcal{O}(10^8 u)$. For double precision where $u \\approx 10^{-16}$, the relative error is $\\approx 10^{-8}$, implying a loss of about $8$ decimal digits of accuracy. The result is still meaningful.\n    -   $\\boldsymbol{C}$-eigen route error: $\\mathcal{O}((10^8)^2 u) = \\mathcal{O}(10^{16} u)$. For $u \\approx 10^{-16}$, the relative error is $\\mathcal{O}(1)$. This means there is a complete loss of accuracy in the computed smallest stretch; the result is useless.\n    Furthermore, forming $\\boldsymbol{C} = \\boldsymbol{F}^{\\mathsf{T}} \\boldsymbol{F}$ can cause overflow if $\\|\\boldsymbol{F}\\|_2$ is large (e.g., $> 10^{154}$) or underflow and loss of information if singular values are small (e.g., $\\sigma_{\\min} < 10^{-154}$, causing $\\sigma_{\\min}^2$ to underflow to zero).\n    Therefore, for severely ill-conditioned $\\boldsymbol{F}$, the SVD route is the only numerically viable option.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A.** This option correctly states: (1) both pipelines have $\\mathcal{O}(n^3)$ cost; (2) forming $\\boldsymbol{C}$ is an additional matrix multiply; (3) the symmetric eigensolver may have a smaller constant; (4) forming $\\boldsymbol{C}$ squares the condition number, leading to relative error scaling of $\\mathcal{O}(\\kappa_2(\\boldsymbol{F})^2 u)$ versus $\\mathcal{O}(\\kappa_2(\\boldsymbol{F}) u)$ for SVD; (5) the practical recommendations for both moderately and severely conditioned regimes are correct, including the considerations for when $\\boldsymbol{C}$ is available or orthogonal factors are needed, and the risks of overflow/underflow. This option is fully consistent with our derivation. **Correct**.\n\n**B.** This option claims the $\\boldsymbol{C}$-eigen route has $\\mathcal{O}(n^2)$ cost, which is incorrect; both the matrix multiplication and the dense eigensolver are $\\mathcal{O}(n^3)$. It also claims this route is always more stable because $\\boldsymbol{C}$ is symmetric, which is a dangerous oversimplification. It completely ignores the catastrophic instability introduced by *forming* $\\boldsymbol{C}$ from an ill-conditioned $\\boldsymbol{F}$. **Incorrect**.\n\n**C.** This option correctly states the $\\mathcal{O}(n^3)$ cost but incorrectly claims the error scaling is $\\mathcal{O}(\\kappa_2(\\boldsymbol{F}) u)$ for both routes. This is a critical error; it misses the condition number squaring effect, which is the central point of the numerical stability analysis. Consequently, its recommendation to choose based on convenience is unsound. **Incorrect**.\n\n**D.** This option incorrectly states that SVD cost is $\\mathcal{O}(n^4)$. It is $\\mathcal{O}(n^3)$. Its stability claim that SVD is less stable for small singular values and that the $\\boldsymbol{C}$-eigen route is better for ill-conditioned $\\boldsymbol{F}$ is precisely the opposite of the truth. The SVD is the preferred method for accurately computing small singular values of ill-conditioned matrices. **Incorrect**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2675199"}]}
