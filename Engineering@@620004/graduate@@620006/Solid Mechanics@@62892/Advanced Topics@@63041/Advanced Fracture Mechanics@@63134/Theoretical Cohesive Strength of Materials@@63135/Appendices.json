The total potential energy per atom, $U_{\\text{atom}}$, is the sum of the energies of the bonds connected to it, divided by $2$ to correct for double counting. Therefore, the energy per atom is $U_{\\text{atom}}(r) = \\frac{1}{2}(\\phi(r) + \\phi(r)) = \\phi(r)$.\n\nAt equilibrium, the nearest-neighbor separation is $r = r_{0}$. The potential energy per atom at equilibrium is:\n$$\nU_{\\text{atom}}(r_{0}) = \\phi(r_{0}) = D\\left(\\left[1-\\exp\\left(-\\alpha\\left(r_{0}-r_{0}\\right)\\right)\\right]^{2}-1\\right) = D\\left(\\left[1-\\exp(0)\\right]^{2}-1\\right) = D\\left(\\left[1-1\\right]^{2}-1\\right) = -D\n$$\nThis represents the minimum energy state of an atom within the chain.\n\nThe cohesive energy, $E_{\\text{coh}}$, is defined as the energy required per atom to separate the solid into its constituent, non-interacting atoms. This corresponds to the energy needed to increase the interatomic separation from its equilibrium value $r_{0}$ to infinity. The energy of an atom when infinitely separated from its neighbors is given by the reference energy:\n$$\nU_{\\text{atom}}(\\infty) = \\phi(\\infty) = 0\n$$\nThe cohesive energy is thus the difference between the final (separated) energy and the initial (equilibrium) energy:\n$$\nE_{\\text{coh}} = U_{\\text{atom}}(\\infty) - U_{\\text{atom}}(r_{0}) = 0 - (-D) = D\n$$\nThe adopted sign convention is that the cohesive energy is a positive quantity, representing the energy that must be supplied to the system to overcome the atomic bonds. The binding energy of the solid would be the negative of this value, $-D$.\n\n(b) Ideal Tensile Strength\nThe strain energy density, $W$, is defined as the potential energy per unit reference volume. The reference volume per atom is given as $V_{0} = A r_{0}$. The strain energy per atom is $U_{\\text{atom}}(r) = \\phi(r)$. Therefore, the strain energy density as a function of the separation $r$ is:\n$$\nW(r) = \\frac{\\phi(r)}{A r_{0}}\n$$\nThe deformation is described by the stretch $\\lambda$, where $r = \\lambda r_{0}$. The nominal (first Piola-Kirchhoff) stress, $\\sigma$, is the work-conjugate to the stretch $\\lambda$. For uniaxial tension, this relationship is:\n$$\n\\sigma = \\frac{\\partial W}{\\partial \\lambda}\n$$\nWe compute the derivative using the chain rule:\n$$\n\\sigma(\\lambda) = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\lambda} \\left( \\frac{\\phi(\\lambda r_{0})}{A r_{0}} \\right) = \\frac{1}{A r_{0}} \\frac{d\\phi(r)}{dr}\\bigg|_{r=\\lambda r_{0}} \\frac{dr}{d\\lambda}\n$$\nSince $r(\\lambda) = \\lambda r_{0}$, we have $\\frac{dr}{d\\lambda} = r_{0}$. Substituting this into the expression for stress yields:\n$$\n\\sigma(r) = \\frac{1}{A r_{0}} \\frac{d\\phi}{dr} \\cdot r_{0} = \\frac{1}{A} \\frac{d\\phi}{dr}\n$$\nThis shows that the nominal stress is the interatomic force $\\frac{d\\phi}{dr}$ per unit of reference cross-sectional area $A$. We now compute the derivative of the Morse potential:\n$$\n\\frac{d\\phi}{dr} = D \\frac{d}{dr} \\left( \\left[1-\\exp\\left(-\\alpha\\left(r-r_{0}\\right)\\right)\\right]^{2}-1 \\right)\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{d\\phi}{dr} = D \\cdot 2\\left[1-\\exp\\left(-\\alpha\\left(r-r_{0}\\right)\\right)\\right] \\cdot \\left(-\\exp\\left(-\\alpha\\left(r-r_{0}\\right)\\right)\\right) \\cdot (-\\alpha)\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{d\\phi}{dr} = 2D\\alpha \\left[1-\\exp\\left(-\\alpha\\left(r-r_{0}\\right)\\right)\\right]\\exp\\left(-\\alpha\\left(r-r_{0}\\right)\\right)\n$$\nThus, the nominal stress as a function of separation $r$ is:\n$$\n\\sigma(r) = \\frac{2D\\alpha}{A} \\left[ \\exp\\left(-\\alpha\\left(r-r_{0}\\right)\\right) - \\exp\\left(-2\\alpha\\left(r-r_{0}\\right)\\right) \\right]\n$$\nThe ideal tensile strength, $\\sigma_{\\text{ideal}}$, is the maximum value of this stress. To find the maximum, we must find the separation $r^{\\star}$ where the derivative of the stress with respect to $r$ is zero, i.e., $\\frac{d\\sigma}{dr}=0$. This is equivalent to finding the inflection point of the potential energy curve, where $\\frac{d^{2}\\phi}{dr^{2}}=0$.\n$$\n\\frac{d\\sigma}{dr} = \\frac{1}{A} \\frac{d^{2}\\phi}{dr^{2}} = \\frac{2D\\alpha}{A} \\frac{d}{dr} \\left[ \\exp\\left(-\\alpha\\left(r-r_{0}\\right)\\right) - \\exp\\left(-2\\alpha\\left(r-r_{0}\\right)\\right) \\right]\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{d\\sigma}{dr} = \\frac{2D\\alpha}{A} \\left[ -\\alpha\\exp\\left(-\\alpha\\left(r-r_{0}\\right)\\right) - (-2\\alpha)\\exp\\left(-2\\alpha\\left(r-r_{0}\\right)\\right) \\right]\n$$\nSetting $\\frac{d\\sigma}{dr}=0$ at $r=r^{\\star}$:\n$$\n-\\alpha\\exp\\left(-\\alpha\\left(r^{\\star}-r_{0}\\right)\\right) + 2\\alpha\\exp\\left(-2\\alpha\\left(r^{\\star}-r_{0}\\right)\\right) = 0\n$$\nSince $\\alpha \\neq 0$, we can divide by it:\n$$\n2\\exp\\left(-2\\alpha\\left(r^{\\star}-r_{0}\\right)\\right) = \\exp\\left(-\\alpha\\left(r^{\\star}-r_{0}\\right)\\right)\n$$\nLetting $y = \\exp\\left(-\\alpha\\left(r^{\\star}-r_{0}\\right)\\right)$, the equation becomes $2y^2 = y$. As $y$ cannot be zero (since $r^{\\star}$ is finite), we divide by $y$ to obtain $y = \\frac{1}{2}$.\n$$\n\\exp\\left(-\\alpha\\left(r^{\\star}-r_{0}\\right)\\right) = \\frac{1}{2}\n$$\nThis gives the value of the exponential term at the point of maximum stress. The separation $r^{\\star}$ itself is $r^{\\star} = r_{0} + \\frac{\\ln(2)}{\\alpha}$.\n\nFinally, to find the ideal tensile strength $\\sigma_{\\text{ideal}}$, we substitute the condition for maximum stress, $\\exp\\left(-\\alpha\\left(r^{\\star}-r_{0}\\right)\\right)=\\frac{1}{2}$, back into the expression for $\\sigma(r)$:\n$$\n\\sigma_{\\text{ideal}} = \\sigma(r^{\\star}) = \\frac{2D\\alpha}{A} \\left[ \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) - \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^{2} \\right]\n$$\n$$\n\\sigma_{\\text{ideal}} = \\frac{2D\\alpha}{A} \\left[ \\frac{1}{2} - \\frac{1}{4} \\right] = \\frac{2D\\alpha}{A} \\left[ \\frac{1}{4} \\right]\n$$\n$$\n\\sigma_{\\text{ideal}} = \\frac{D\\alpha}{2A}\n$$\nThis is the final expression for the ideal tensile strength of the one-dimensional atomic chain.

At this point, the effective mode II SIF is $k_{II, c} = K_{Ie} \\sin(\\frac{\\theta_s}{2})\\cos^2(\\frac{\\theta_s}{2})$.\nThe energy release rate for this mode II process, $G_{II}$, under plane strain is:\n$$\nG_{II} = \\frac{1-\\nu^2}{E} k_{II}^2\n$$\nThe criterion for emission is $G_{II} = \\Gamma_s = \\gamma_{\\mathrm{us}}$. Substituting the expression for the critical effective SIF, $k_{II,c}$:\n$$\n\\frac{1-\\nu^2}{E} \\left( K_{Ie} \\sin\\left(\\frac{\\theta_s}{2}\\right)\\cos^2\\left(\\frac{\\theta_s}{2}\\right) \\right)^2 = \\gamma_{\\mathrm{us}}\n$$\nSolving for $K_{Ie}^2$, we find the square of the critical SIF for emission:\n$$\nK_{Ie}^2 = \\frac{\\gamma_{\\mathrm{us}} E}{(1-\\nu^2) \\left[ \\sin\\left(\\frac{\\theta_s}{2}\\right)\\cos^2\\left(\\frac{\\theta_s}{2}\\right) \\right]^2}\n$$\nNow we can compute the ratio $R^2 = (\\sigma_{\\mathrm{em}}/\\sigma_{\\mathrm{cl}})^2 = K_{Ie}^2 / K_{Ic}^2$.\n$$\nR^2 = \\frac{ \\frac{\\gamma_{\\mathrm{us}} E}{(1-\\nu^2) \\left[ \\sin\\left(\\frac{\\theta_s}{2}\\right)\\cos^2\\left(\\frac{\\theta_s}{2}\\right) \\right]^2} }{ \\frac{2\\gamma E}{1-\\nu^2} }\n$$\nThe terms involving elastic constants, $E/(1-\\nu^2)$, cancel out, as expected for a ratio of critical loads for two competing mechanisms driven by the same elastic field.\n$$\nR^2 = \\frac{\\gamma_{\\mathrm{us}}}{2\\gamma} \\frac{1}{\\left[ \\sin\\left(\\frac{\\theta_s}{2}\\right)\\cos^2\\left(\\frac{\\theta_s}{2}\\right) \\right]^2}\n$$\nTaking the square root gives the expression for $R$:\n$$\nR = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\gamma_{\\mathrm{us}}}{2\\gamma}} \\frac{1}{\\left| \\sin\\left(\\frac{\\theta_s}{2}\\right)\\cos^2\\left(\\frac{\\theta_s}{2}\\right) \\right|}\n$$\nWe are given the material properties $\\gamma = 1.60\\,\\mathrm{J/m^{2}}$, $\\gamma_{\\mathrm{us}} = 0.250\\,\\mathrm{J/m^{2}}$, and the slip plane angle $\\theta_s = 60^{\\circ}$.
