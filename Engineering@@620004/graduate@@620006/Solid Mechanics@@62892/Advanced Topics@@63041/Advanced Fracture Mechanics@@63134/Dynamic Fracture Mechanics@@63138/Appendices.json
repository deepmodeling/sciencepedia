The problem is a standard, solvable exercise in elastodynamics.\n\nStep 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is **valid**. A solution will be derived.\n\nSolution Derivation\n\nThe one-dimensional elastic wave equation governs the stress $\\sigma(x,t)$. Its general solution, by d'Alembert's principle, is the superposition of a forward-propagating wave $f$ and a backward-propagating wave $g$:\n$$ \\sigma(x,t) = f\\left(t - \\frac{x}{c}\\right) + g\\left(t + \\frac{x}{c}\\right) $$\nThe initial condition of a quiescent bar requires $f(\\xi)=0$ for $\\xi0$ and $g(\\xi)=0$ for $\\xi0$ before any boundary interaction. The traction at $x=0$ generates the forward-propagating wave. Before this wave reflects from $x=L$ and returns to $x=0$ (an event which takes a total time of $2L/c$), the backward wave contribution $g(t)$ at $x=0$ is zero. Thus, from the boundary condition at $x=0$, we have:\n$$ \\sigma(0,t) = f(t) = \\sigma_{\\mathrm{in}}(t) = -s(t) $$\nThis defines the forward-propagating wave for arguments greater than or equal to $0$.\n\nThe boundary condition at the traction-free face $x=L$ is $\\sigma(L,t) = 0$. Substituting this into the general solution:\n$$ \\sigma(L,t) = f\\left(t - \\frac{L}{c}\\right) + g\\left(t + \\frac{L}{c}\\right) = 0 $$\nLet $\\eta = t + L/c$. Then $t = \\eta - L/c$, and the argument of $f$ becomes $\\eta - 2L/c$. This gives a relationship for the reflected wave $g$:\n$$ g(\\eta) = -f\\left(\\eta - \\frac{2L}{c}\\right) $$\nUsing the determined form of $f$, we find the reflected wave:\n$$ g(\\eta) = - \\left( -s\\left(\\eta - \\frac{2L}{c}\\right) \\right) = s\\left(\\eta - \\frac{2L}{c}\\right) $$\nThe incident compressive pulse reflects from the free surface as a tensile pulse of the same shape.\n\nThe total stress field $\\sigma(x,t)$ within the bar, prior to any re-reflection from the $x=0$ boundary, is given by the superposition of the incident and first reflected waves:\n$$ \\sigma(x,t) = f\\left(t - \\frac{x}{c}\\right) + g\\left(t + \\frac{x}{c}\\right) = -s\\left(t - \\frac{x}{c}\\right) + s\\left(t + \\frac{x}{c} - \\frac{2L}{c}\\right) $$\nWe are looking for the maximum tensile (positive) stress. Let $\\xi_1 = t - x/c$ and $\\xi_2 = t + x/c - 2L/c$. The stress is $\\sigma(x,t) = s(\\xi_2) - s(\\xi_1)$. Note that the time lag between the two wave components at a point $x$ is $\\Delta t = \\xi_1 - \\xi_2 = (2L-2x)/c  0$ for $xL$.\n\nMaximum tensile stress occurs through constructive interference. The peak tensile stress is generated when the unloading (tail) sections of the interacting waves superpose. The unloading part of the pulse $s(t)$ occurs for $\\tau_r  t  \\tau_p$ and is characterized by a constant negative slope, $m_f$:\n$$ m_f = \\frac{d}{dt}\\left[\\frac{\\sigma_{0}}{\\tau_{p}-\\tau_{r}}\\left(\\tau_{p}-t\\right)\\right] = -\\frac{\\sigma_{0}}{\\tau_{p}-\\tau_{r}} $$\nWhen both $\\xi_1$ and $\\xi_2$ are within the unloading region $(\\tau_r, \\tau_p)$, the stress at location $x$ becomes a time-independent plateau with magnitude:\n$$ \\sigma_{max}(x) = s(\\xi_2) - s(\\xi_1) = \\int_{\\xi_1}^{\\xi_2} s'(\\xi) \\,d\\xi = m_f (\\xi_2-\\xi_1) = m_f \\left(-\\frac{2L-2x}{c}\\right) $$\nSubstituting the expression for $m_f$:\n$$ \\sigma_{max}(x) = \\left(-\\frac{\\sigma_{0}}{\\tau_{p}-\\tau_{r}}\\right) \\left(-\\frac{2(L-x)}{c}\\right) = \\frac{2\\sigma_{0}(L-x)}{c(\\tau_{p}-\\tau_{r})} $$\nThis tensile stress is a linear function of $x$, increasing as $x$ decreases. Spall nucleates at a location $x_{\\mathrm{sp}}$ where this maximum stress first equals the failure threshold $\\sigma_f$:\n$$ \\sigma_f = \\frac{2\\sigma_{0}(L-x_{\\mathrm{sp}})}{c(\\tau_{p}-\\tau_{r})} $$\nSolving for $x_{\\mathrm{sp}}$ gives the location of the spall plane:\n$$ L-x_{\\mathrm{sp}} = \\frac{c\\sigma_f(\\tau_p - \\tau_r)}{2\\sigma_0} \\implies x_{\\mathrm{sp}} = L - \\frac{c\\sigma_f(\\tau_p - \\tau_r)}{2\\sigma_0} $$\nThe given constraint $c\\,\\frac{\\left(\\tau_{p}-\\tau_{r}\\right)\\sigma_{f}}{\\sigma_{0}} \\le 2L$ ensures that $x_{\\mathrm{sp}} \\ge 0$. The problem statement implies spall occurs for $x \\in (0,L)$, so $x_{\\mathrm{sp}}0$.\n\nThe earliest time $t_{\\mathrm{sp}}$ at which this failure stress $\\sigma_f$ is reached at $x_{\\mathrm{sp}}$ corresponds to the onset of this stress plateau. This occurs when the \"knee\" of the reflected pulse, which marks the beginning of its unloading phase, arrives at $x_{\\mathrm{sp}}$. The trajectory of this knee is defined by its time argument being equal to $\\tau_r$. The argument for the reflected wave is $t + x/c - 2L/c$.\nThus, at the spall event $(x_{\\mathrm{sp}}, t_{\\mathrm{sp}})$:\n$$ t_{\\mathrm{sp}} + \\frac{x_{\\mathrm{sp}}}{c} - \\frac{2L}{c} = \\tau_r $$\nSolving for the spall time $t_{\\mathrm{sp}}$:\n$$ t_{\\mathrm{sp}} = \\tau_r + \\frac{2L - x_{\\mathrm{sp}}}{c} $$\nNow we substitute the expression for $x_{\\mathrm{sp}}$ into this equation:\n$$ t_{\\mathrm{sp}} = \\tau_r + \\frac{1}{c} \\left( 2L - \\left[ L - \\frac{c\\sigma_f(\\tau_p - \\tau_r)}{2\\sigma_0} \\right] \\right) $$\n$$ t_{\\mathrm{sp}} = \\tau_r + \\frac{1}{c} \\left( L + \\frac{c\\sigma_f(\\tau_p - \\tau_r)}{2\\sigma_0} \\right) $$\nSimplifying the expression yields the final result for the spall time:\n$$ t_{\\mathrm{sp}} = \\tau_r + \\frac{L}{c} + \\frac{\\sigma_f(\\tau_p - \\tau_r)}{2\\sigma_0} $$\nThis expression represents the sum of the time for the incident pulse's knee to reach the spall region's vicinity, plus the time for the reflected wave to travel and establish the critical stress state.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\tau_r + \\frac{L}{c} + \\frac{(\\tau_p - \\tau_r)\\sigma_f}{2\\sigma_0}}$$", "id": "2632642"}, {"introduction": "While we often speak of fracture toughness as a material constant, its apparent value during dynamic crack propagation is highly sensitive to the geometry of the component.

All terms, such as energy release rate, stress intensity factor, plane stress, and plane strain, are standard. The provided relationships and definitions are consistent with established theory, notably the work of Freund on dynamic fracture and Irwin's model for plasticity. The stated material behavior (rate-dependent fracture energy) is realistic for polymers. The problem asks for a qualitative comparison based on fundamental principles, and it provides a self-contained set of these principles. There are no scientific or logical contradictions, no missing information, and no reliance on subjective speculation. The problem is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. A solution will be derived.\n\n**Derivation**\n\nThe analysis will address four key aspects, derived from the given principles, to evaluate the options: (1) apparent dynamic toughness, (2) microbranching onset, (3) small-scale yielding validity, and (4) power scaling with thickness.\n\n1.  **Apparent Dynamic Toughness ($K_{\\mathrm{app}}(v)$)**\n    The energy required to advance a crack per unit area, the apparent toughness $G_{c}(v)$, is the sum of the intrinsic fracture energy $\\Gamma(v)$ and the energy dissipated through plastic deformation in the process zone. The extent of this plastic dissipation is related to the size of the plastic zone, $r_p$.\n    The problem states $r_{p} \\sim C\\,K_{I}^{2}/\\sigma_{y}^{2}$ and that the prefactor $C$ is larger for plane stress than for plane strain ($C_{\\text{plane stress}}  C_{\\text{plane strain}}$).\n    This implies that for a given level of applied stress intensity factor $K_I$, the plastic zone is larger in the thin plate (plane stress) than in the thick plate (plane strain).\n    $$ r_{p, \\text{thin}}  r_{p, \\text{thick}} \\quad (\\text{at the same } K_I) $$\n    A larger plastic zone leads to greater energy dissipation through plastic work. Therefore, the total energy required to drive the crack at speed $v$, which is the apparent energy release rate toughness $G_c(v)$, is higher in the thin plate.\n    $$ G_{c, \\text{thin}}(v)  G_{c, \\text{thick}}(v) $$\n    The apparent toughness expressed as a stress intensity factor, $K_{\\mathrm{app}}(v)$, is related to $G_c(v)$ via $G_c(v) = \\alpha(v) K_{\\mathrm{app}}^2(v) / E'$. The primary physical reason for the difference in toughness is the plastic dissipation, which is captured by $G_c(v)$. A higher $G_c(v)$ requires a higher applied load, which translates to a higher measured $K_{\\mathrm{app}}(v)$. Thus, the apparent toughness $K_{\\mathrm{app}}(v)$ is higher in the thin plate under plane stress conditions.\n\n2.  **Microbranching Onset**\n    Microbranching is an instability that occurs when the energy flowing to the crack tip, $G(v)$, significantly exceeds the energy that can be dissipated by the fundamental fracture process, $\\Gamma(v)$. This is often modeled as occurring when $G(v)$ reaches a critical value for branching, let us call it $G_{b}$. We shall assume $G_{b}$ is a material property, independent of specimen geometry and constraint, although it may depend on $v$.\n    The dynamic fracture toughness curves, $G_{c, \\text{thin}}(v)$ and $G_{c, \\text{thick}}(v)$, represent the required energy release rate to sustain a crack at speed $v$. As established, $G_{c, \\text{thin}}(v)  G_{c, \\text{thick}}(v)$ for all $v$. Both functions are typically non-decreasing with $v$.\n    The onset of branching occurs at a speed $v_{\\text{branch}}$ where the material's toughness curve intersects the branching threshold $G_{b}$:\n    $$ G_{c}(v_{\\text{branch}}) = G_{b} $$\n    Since the toughness curve for the thin plate, $G_{c, \\text{thin}}(v)$, lies above the curve for the thick plate, $G_{c, \\text{thick}}(v)$, it will intersect the horizontal line at $G=G_{b}$ at a higher value of $v$.\n    $$ v_{\\text{branch, thin}}  v_{\\text{branch, thick}} $$\n    Therefore, the microbranching onset velocity is higher in the thin plate (plane stress) than in the thick plate (plane strain). The greater plastic dissipation in the thin plate provides a stabilizing effect, requiring a higher crack speed (and thus higher energy input rate) to trigger the instability.\n\n3.  **Small-Scale Yielding (SSY) Condition**\n    The assumption of small-scale yielding is valid when the plastic zone size $r_p$ is significantly smaller than other relevant geometric lengths, such as the crack length $a$ or the uncracked ligament.\n    From the given scaling, $r_{p} \\sim C\\,K_{I}^{2}/\\sigma_{y}^{2}$ with $C_{\\text{plane stress}}  C_{\\text{plane strain}}$. This means that for the same applied $K_I$, the plastic zone is smaller under plane strain conditions (in the thick plate).\n    A smaller plastic zone makes it easier to satisfy the condition $r_p \\ll a$. Consequently, the SSY assumption is more robust and easier to satisfy for the thick plate. In other words, increasing the thickness, which promotes a plane strain state, reduces the plastic zone size for a given $K_I$ and thus makes the SSY condition easier to meet.\n\n4.  **Power Scaling with Thickness**\n    The power flowing to the crack front is given by the definition $P = G(v)\\,B\\,v$. Here, $G(v)$ is the energy flux per unit length of the crack front (i.e., per unit thickness), $B$ is the total length of the crack front (the thickness), and $v$ is the crack speed.\n    If we consider how the total power $P$ changes with thickness $B$ while holding the material behavior $G(v)$ and crack speed $v$ constant (as is done when comparing specimens under the same constraint state), the relationship is one of direct proportionality.\n    $$ P \\propto B $$\n    Thus, the power to the crack front scales linearly with thickness.\n\n**Option-by-Option Analysis**\n\n- **A. In the thin plate (plane stress), the apparent dynamic toughness expressed as a stress intensity, $K_{\\mathrm{app}}(v)$, is higher than in the thick plate (plane strain) due to greater near-tip dissipation; the microbranching onset velocity as a fraction of Rayleigh wave speed is higher in the thin plate than in the thick plate; increasing thickness makes small-scale yielding easier to satisfy; and the power to the crack front scales linearly with thickness.**\n    - Toughness statement: Agrees with conclusion (1). **Correct**.\n    - Microbranching statement: Agrees with conclusion (2).

It is a standard, non-trivial problem in numerical analysis for partial differential equations.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. A solution will be derived.\n\n**Derivation**\n\nThe analysis begins with the stability of the central-difference time integration scheme applied to the semi-discrete equations of motion. The system is $M \\ddot{u} + K u = 0$.\n\nThe central-difference approximation for acceleration at time step $n$ is:\n$$\n\\ddot{u}_n \\approx \\frac{u_{n+1} - 2u_n + u_{n-1}}{(\\Delta t)^2}\n$$\nSubstituting this into the governing equation for a degree of freedom corresponding to a natural frequency $\\Omega$ of the discrete system, we obtain the scalar modal equation:\n$$\n\\frac{d_{n+1} - 2d_n + d_{n-1}}{(\\Delta t)^2} + \\Omega^2 d_n = 0\n$$\nwhere $d_n$ is the modal coordinate at time $t_n = n \\Delta t$. This rearranges to a linear difference equation:\n$$\nd_{n+1} - (2 - \\Omega^2 (\\Delta t)^2) d_n + d_{n-1} = 0\n$$\nFor a stable, non-dissipative scheme, the solution must remain bounded. We seek solutions of the form $d_n = \\lambda^n$. This leads to the characteristic equation:\n$$\n\\lambda^2 - (2 - \\Omega^2 (\\Delta t)^2) \\lambda + 1 = 0\n$$\nFor the solution to remain bounded, the roots $\\lambda$ must satisfy $|\\lambda| \\le 1$. The roots are complex conjugates with magnitude $|\\lambda|=1$ if the discriminant is negative. Stability is lost when the roots become real and one root has a magnitude greater than $1$. This occurs when the term in the parenthesis is less than or equal to $-2$:\n$$\n2 - \\Omega^2 (\\Delta t)^2 \\le -2\n$$\nThis condition is equivalent to $\\Omega^2 (\\Delta t)^2 \\ge 4$. Thus, for stability, we must have:\n$$\n\\Omega \\Delta t  2\n$$\nThis condition must hold for all natural frequencies $\\Omega$ of the discrete system. The time step is therefore limited by the highest frequency, $\\Omega_{\\max}$:\n$$\n\\Delta t \\le \\frac{2}{\\Omega_{\\max}}\n$$\nThe critical time step is therefore $\\Delta t_c = 2 / \\Omega_{\\max}$.\n\nNext, we must determine $\\Omega_{\\max}$ for the specified system: a uniform one-dimensional mesh of linear elements with element size $h$ and a lumped mass matrix.\n\nFor a $1$D bar element of length $h$, cross-sectional area $A$, Young's modulus $E$, and density $\\rho$, the stiffness matrix is $k^e = \\frac{AE}{h} \\begin{pmatrix} 1  -1 \\\\ -1  1 \\end{pmatrix}$. The lumped mass matrix is $m^e = \\frac{\\rho A h}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 1  0 \\\\ 0  1 \\end{pmatrix}$.\n\nConsider an interior node $j$ in a uniform mesh. Its mass is the sum of contributions from the two adjacent elements: $M_j = \\frac{1}{2}\\rho A h + \\frac{1}{2}\\rho A h = \\rho A h$. The force on node $j$ is the sum of forces from the adjacent elements: $F_j = \\frac{AE}{h}(u_{j-1} - u_j) + \\frac{AE}{h}(u_{j+1} - u_j) = \\frac{AE}{h}(u_{j-1} - 2u_j + u_{j+1})$.\n\nThe equation of motion for node $j$ is $M_j \\ddot{u}_j = F_j$:\n$$\n(\\rho A h) \\ddot{u}_j = \\frac{AE}{h}(u_{j-1} - 2u_j + u_{j+1})\n$$\nLet's seek modal solutions of the form $u_j(t) = \\phi_j e^{i\\Omega t}$, where $\\phi_j$ is the mode shape amplitude at node $j$. Substituting this into the equation gives the eigenvalue problem:\n$$\n-\\Omega^2 (\\rho A h) \\phi_j = \\frac{AE}{h}(\\phi_{j-1} - 2\\phi_j + \\phi_{j+1})\n$$\nDividing by $A$ and rearranging:\n$$\n\\Omega^2 = \\frac{E}{\\rho h^2} \\frac{2\\phi_j - \\phi_{j-1} - \\phi_{j+1}}{\\phi_j}\n$$\nThe eigenvectors for a uniform grid are discrete sinusoids, $\\phi_j = \\sin(k x_j) = \\sin(k j h)$, where $k$ is the wavenumber. Substituting this form:\n$$\n\\Omega^2 = \\frac{c^2}{h^2} \\frac{2\\sin(kjh) - \\sin(k(j-1)h) - \\sin(k(j+1)h)}{\\sin(kjh)}\n$$\nUsing the trigonometric identity $\\sin(a \\pm b) = \\sin(a)\\cos(b) \\pm \\cos(a)\\sin(b)$:\n$$\n\\Omega^2 = \\frac{c^2}{h^2} \\frac{2\\sin(kjh) - 2\\sin(kjh)\\cos(kh)}{\\sin(kjh)} = \\frac{2c^2}{h^2}(1 - \\cos(kh))\n$$\nUsing the half-angle identity $1 - \\cos(kh) = 2\\sin^2(kh/2)$:\n$$\n\\Omega^2 = \\frac{4c^2}{h^2} \\sin^2\\left(\\frac{kh}{2}\\right)\n$$\nThe natural frequencies are thus $\\Omega(k) = \\frac{2c}{h} \\left|\\sin\\left(\\frac{kh}{2}\\right)\\right|$. The maximum frequency $\\Omega_{\\max}$ occurs at the highest representable wavenumber $k_{\\max}$ for a discrete mesh of spacing $h$. This corresponds to the shortest possible wavelength, $\\lambda_{\\min} = 2h$, which represents a mode where nodal displacements alternate in sign. The wavenumber is $k_{\\max} = 2\\pi/\\lambda_{\\min} = \\pi/h$.\nSubstituting $k_{\\max}$ into the expression for $\\Omega$:\n$$\n\\Omega_{\\max} = \\frac{2c}{h} \\left|\\sin\\left(\\frac{(\\pi/h)h}{2}\\right)\\right| = \\frac{2c}{h} |\\sin(\\pi/2)| = \\frac{2c}{h}\n$$\nFinally, we substitute this $\\Omega_{\\max}$ into the stability condition for the critical time step:\n$$\n\\Delta t_c = \\frac{2}{\\Omega_{\\max}} = \\frac{2}{2c/h} = \\frac{h}{c}\n$$\nThe problem uses $c_{\\max}$ as the general limiting wave speed, which for the $1$D case is simply $c$. Therefore, the critical time step is:\n$$\n\\Delta t_c = \\frac{h}{c_{\\max}}\n$$\n\n**Option-by-Option Analysis**\n\nA. $\\Delta t_{c} \\approx h / c_{\\max}$: This expression exactly matches the result derived from first principles for a $1$D uniform mesh of linear elements with a lumped mass matrix. The proportionality constant $\\alpha$ is $1$. This option is **Correct**.\n\nB. $\\Delta t_{c} \\approx 2 h / c_{\\max}$: This expression would imply a stability limit of $\\Delta t \\le 1/\\Omega_{\\max}$ or an $\\Omega_{\\max}$ of $c/h$, both of which are inconsistent with the derivation for the central difference method and the given discrete system. This option is **Incorrect**.\n\nC. $\\Delta t_{c} \\approx h / (2 c_{\\max})$: This expression would imply an $\\Omega_{\\max}$ of $4c/h$, which contradicts the derived maximum frequency of $2c/h$ for the lumped-mass system. This option is **Incorrect**.\n\nD. $\\Delta t_{c} \\approx h^{2} / c_{\\max}$: This expression is dimensionally inconsistent. A time step $\\Delta t_{c}$ must have units of time $[T]$. The expression $h^2/c_{\\max}$ has units of $[L]^2 / ([L]/[T]) = [L][T]$, which is not time. On this basis alone, it is fundamentally flawed.
