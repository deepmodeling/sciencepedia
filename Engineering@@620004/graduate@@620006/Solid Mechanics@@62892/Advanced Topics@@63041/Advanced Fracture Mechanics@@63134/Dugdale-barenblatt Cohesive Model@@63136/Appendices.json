It is well-posed, providing a sufficient set of parameters ($\\sigma_c$, $K_0$, $\\delta_c$) and clear definitions to determine the requested quantities ($G_c$, $\\delta_p$). The language used is objective and precise, devoid of ambiguity. The constraints given are physically realistic for such a model. There are no internal contradictions, missing information, or violations of physical principles.\n\nThe verdict is that the problem is valid. We proceed with the derivation.\n\nThe traction-separation law, $\\sigma(\\delta)$, where $\\sigma$ is the normal cohesive traction and $\\delta$ is the normal opening displacement, is defined in two parts.\n\nPart 1: The initial linear elastic branch for $0 \\le \\delta \\le \\delta_p$.\nThe relationship is given by the stiffness $K_0$:\n$$ \\sigma(\\delta) = K_0 \\delta $$\nThis linear relationship holds up to the peak traction $\\sigma_c$, which is reached at the opening displacement $\\delta_p$. By substituting these values into the equation, we establish a direct relation between the parameters:\n$$ \\sigma_c = K_0 \\delta_p $$\nThe problem requires an expression for $\\delta_p$ in terms of the given parameters. From this equation, we can directly solve for $\\delta_p$:\n$$ \\delta_p = \\frac{\\sigma_c}{K_0} $$\nThis is the first required quantity. It depends on $\\sigma_c$ and $K_0$, which is consistent with the problem's requirements.\n\nPart 2: The work of separation, $G_c$.\nThe critical energy release rate, $G_c$, is defined as the work of separation per unit area. This corresponds to the total area under the traction-separation curve, $\\sigma(\\delta)$, from $\\delta=0$ until complete separation at $\\delta=\\delta_c$. Mathematically, this is expressed as the integral:\n$$ G_c = \\int_0^{\\delta_c} \\sigma(\\delta) \\, d\\delta $$\nThe traction-separation law describes a path in the $\\sigma$-$\\delta$ plane. The path starts at the origin $(0, 0)$, proceeds linearly to the peak point $(\\delta_p, \\sigma_c)$, and then decreases linearly to the point $(\\delta_c, 0)$, where the traction vanishes and the surfaces are fully separated. This path forms a triangle with vertices at $(0, 0)$, $(\\delta_p, \\sigma_c)$, and $(\\delta_c, 0)$.\n\nA more formal representation of the full bilinear law is:\n$$\n\\sigma(\\delta) =\n\\begin{cases}\nK_0 \\delta & \\text{if } 0 \\le \\delta \\le \\delta_p \\\\\n\\sigma_c \\left( \\frac{\\delta_c - \\delta}{\\delta_c - \\delta_p} \\right) & \\text{if } \\delta_p < \\delta \\le \\delta_c \\\\\n0 & \\text{if } \\delta > \\delta_c\n\\end{cases}\n$$\nThe integral for $G_c$ can be geometrically interpreted as the area of this triangle. The base of the triangle extends along the $\\delta$-axis from $\\delta=0$ to $\\delta=\\delta_c$, so its length is $\\delta_c$. The height of the triangle is the maximum traction achieved, which is $\\sigma_c$.\n\nThe area of a triangle is given by the formula $\\frac{1}{2} \\times \\text{base} \\times \\text{height}$.

The goal is to analyze the stability of the global force-displacement response, specifically the conditions for snap-back, based on the properties of the cohesive law $T(\\delta)$ and the elastic bar.\n\nFirst, a critical validation of the problem statement is required.\n\n**Problem Validation**\n\nGivens are extracted verbatim:\n- A slender prismatic bar of length $L$, cross-sectional area $A$, and Young’s modulus $E$.\n- A single, zero-thickness cohesive interface opening by a displacement jump $\\delta$.\n- Interface transmits a traction $T(\\delta)$.\n- Bar is subjected to a quasi-static, small-strain, displacement-controlled end shortening $\\Delta$.\n- Left end is fixed.\n- Bar remains linearly elastic.\n- Interface traction is uniform over the cross-section.\n- Resultant axial force is $F$.\n- Inertia and rate effects are neglected.\n- Force equilibrium: $F = A\\,T(\\delta)$.\n- Kinematic compatibility: $\\Delta = \\delta + F L/(E A)$.\n\nThe term \"end shortening $\\Delta$\" is inconsistent with the kinematic compatibility equation $\\Delta = \\delta + F L/(E A)$, where $\\delta$ is an \"opening\" (implying $\\delta \\ge 0$) and $F L/(E A)$ is an elastic elongation for a tensile force $F>0$. In the context of cohesive zone models, opening and positive traction correspond to tension. Therefore, $\\Delta$ must represent a total elongation. This terminological imprecision is noted but does not invalidate the underlying physical and mathematical model, which is standard for a 1D cohesive fracture problem. The problem is scientifically grounded in solid mechanics, well-posed, objective, and contains sufficient information for a rigorous analysis. The problem is deemed valid.\n\n**Derivation of the Global Response and Stability Condition**\n\nThe system is governed by two fundamental relations:\n1.  Force equilibrium across the interface: $F = A\\,T(\\delta)$\n2.  Kinematic compatibility for the series system: $\\Delta = \\delta + \\frac{FL}{EA}$\n\nBy substituting the force-equilibrium relation into the kinematic compatibility equation, we express the total displacement $\\Delta$ as a function of the interface opening $\\delta$:\n$$ \\Delta(\\delta) = \\delta + \\frac{A\\,T(\\delta)L}{EA} = \\delta + \\frac{L}{E}T(\\delta) $$\nThe global force $F$ is also a function of $\\delta$: $F(\\delta) = A\\,T(\\delta)$.\nThe global force-displacement response $F(\\Delta)$ is thus described parametrically in terms of $\\delta$. To analyze its shape and stability, we examine its derivative, $\\frac{dF}{d\\Delta}$. Using the chain rule, this is given by:\n$$ \\frac{dF}{d\\Delta} = \\frac{dF/d\\delta}{d\\Delta/d\\delta} $$\nThe required derivatives with respect to $\\delta$ are:\n$$ \\frac{dF}{d\\delta} = A\\,\\frac{dT}{d\\delta} = A\\,T'(\\delta) $$\n$$ \\frac{d\\Delta}{d\\delta} = 1 + \\frac{L}{E}\\frac{dT}{d\\delta} = 1 + \\frac{L}{E}T'(\\delta) $$\nThus, the slope of the global force-displacement curve is:\n$$ \\frac{dF}{d\\Delta} = \\frac{A\\,T'(\\delta)}{1 + \\frac{L}{E}T'(\\delta)} $$\nA snap-back instability under displacement control occurs when the total displacement $\\Delta$ decreases as the internal degree of freedom $\\delta$ continues to increase. Mathematically, this corresponds to the condition $\\frac{d\\Delta}{d\\delta} < 0$.\n$$ \\frac{d\\Delta}{d\\delta} < 0 \\implies 1 + \\frac{L}{E}T'(\\delta) < 0 $$\nOn a softening branch of the cohesive law, $T'(\\delta) < 0$. The condition for snap-back becomes:\n$$ \\frac{L}{E}T'(\\delta) < -1 \\implies T'(\\delta) < -\\frac{E}{L} $$\nSince $T'(\\delta)$ is negative, this is equivalent to:\n$$ |T'(\\delta)| > \\frac{E}{L} $$\nWe can express this condition in terms of stiffness. The tangent stiffness of the cohesive interface is $k_c(\\delta) = A\\,T'(\\delta)$, which is negative during softening. The stiffness of the elastic bar is $k_e = \\frac{EA}{L}$. The snap-back condition is $|T'(\\delta)| > \\frac{E}{L}$. Multiplying by the area $A$ (which is a positive constant), we get:\n$$ |A\\,T'(\\delta)| > \\frac{EA}{L} \\implies |k_c(\\delta)| > k_e $$\nSnap-back occurs if, at any point on the softening branch, the magnitude of the negative tangent stiffness of the cohesive interface exceeds the stiffness of the surrounding elastic structure.\n\nWith this framework, we evaluate each statement.\n\n**Option-by-Option Analysis**\n\n**A. Under hard displacement control (effectively infinite machine stiffness), a necessary and sufficient condition for snap-back in $F(\\Delta)$ is that at some opening $\\delta$ on the softening branch the magnitude of the cohesive tangent stiffness exceeds the bar stiffness, i.e., $\\lvert A\\,T'(\\delta)\\rvert > E A / L$; equivalently, the cohesive softening slope is steeper in magnitude than the elastic stiffness of the surrounding structure.**\n\nThis statement claims the condition for snap-back is $\\lvert A\\,T'(\\delta)\\rvert > E A / L$. My derivation above shows this is precisely the condition for $\\frac{d\\Delta}{d\\delta} < 0$, which defines snap-back. The phrase \"hard displacement control\" correctly implies that $\\Delta$ is the controlled parameter. The interpretation of the cohesive tangent stiffness as $A\\,T'(\\delta)$ and the bar stiffness as $EA/L$ is correct. The statement is a necessary and sufficient condition.\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\n**B. For a Dugdale cohesive law with a perfectly plastic plateau $T(\\delta)=\\sigma_{c}$ for $0<\\delta<\\delta_{c}$, there is no snap-back prior to reaching $\\delta=\\delta_{c}$; under displacement control the global response exhibits a force plateau $F(\\Delta)=A\\,\\sigma_{c}$ up to $\\delta=\\delta_{c}$, after which $F$ drops as the interface fully decoheres.**\n\nFor the Dugdale model, in the range $0 < \\delta < \\delta_c$, we have $T(\\delta) = \\sigma_c$, a constant. Therefore, the derivative $T'(\\delta) = 0$. The condition for snap-back, $|T'(\\delta)| > E/L$, becomes $0 > E/L$, which is false. Thus, there is no snap-back in this region. The force is $F = A\\,\\sigma_c$, which is constant. The slope of the global response is $\\frac{dF}{d\\Delta} = \\frac{A \\cdot 0}{1 + (L/E) \\cdot 0} = 0$. This confirms a force plateau. At $\\delta = \\delta_c$, the interface fails and traction drops to $0$. This causes the force $F$ in the bar to drop to $0$. The statement's description of the behavior is entirely accurate.\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\n**C. Under load control, the onset of cohesive softening with $T'(\\delta)<0$ causes a loss of stability at a limit point of the global response, independent of $E A/L$; thus the descending branch cannot be followed in load control in this series system.**\n\nUnder load control, the force $F$ is the independent variable. Instability occurs at a limit point, where the system can no longer sustain an increase in load. This happens at the maximum achievable force. The force is $F(\\delta) = A\\,T(\\delta)$. The maximum force occurs when $\\frac{dF}{d\\delta} = A\\,T'(\\delta) = 0$. This condition corresponds to the peak of the cohesive traction law, which is precisely the onset of softening. The value of $\\delta$ where this occurs depends only on the function $T(\\delta)$, not on the bar's properties $E, A, L$. Therefore, the loss of stability is indeed independent of $EA/L$. In a load-controlled test, once the peak force is reached, any further deformation occurs at a lower force capacity, leading to uncontrolled, dynamic failure. It is not possible to stably trace the descending (softening) branch.\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\n**D. Cohesive laws with a mild initial softening slope (small negative $T'(\\delta)$ near the onset of softening), such as an exponential softening with gentle initial tangent, can avoid snap-back provided the bar is sufficiently stiff so that $\\lvert A\\,T'(\\delta)\\rvert < E A / L$ over the range of $\\delta$ traversed; the detailed shape of $T(\\delta)$ matters through how steep the softening becomes relative to the elastic stiffness.**\n\nThis statement describes the condition for stable softening (avoiding snap-back), which from our derivation is $|A\\,T'(\\delta)| < EA/L$. A \"mild\" softening slope means $|T'(\\delta)|$ is small. A \"stiff\" bar means $EA/L$ is large. Both factors make the inequality more likely to be satisfied, thus preventing snap-back. The statement correctly identifies that the stability depends on the competition between the rate of cohesive softening and the bar stiffness. The description is fully consistent with the derived stability condition.\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\n**E. Increasing the compliance of the surrounding structure (reducing $E A/L$) suppresses snap-back under displacement control by making the global force–displacement curve more monotonic in $\\Delta$.**\n\nThe compliance of the bar is $L/(EA)$, the inverse of its stiffness $k_e = EA/L$. Increasing compliance means reducing the stiffness $EA/L$. The condition for snap-back is $|A\\,T'(\\delta)| > EA/L$. If we reduce $EA/L$, the right side of the inequality becomes smaller, making it *easier* to satisfy the condition. Therefore, increasing compliance *promotes* snap-back, rather than suppressing it. A more compliant structure is more prone to snap-back instability. The statement claims the opposite.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**F. If $T(\\delta)$ is strictly decreasing for all $\\delta>0$ (no initial hardening), then snap-back cannot occur under displacement control because $F$ is a monotonic function of $\\delta$.**\n\nThe premise is $T'(\\delta) < 0$ for all $\\delta > 0$. The conclusion is that snap-back cannot occur. The reason given is that $F(\\delta) = A\\,T(\\delta)$ is monotonic. While it is true that $F(\\delta)$ is monotonic decreasing, this is not the criterion for snap-back. The criterion is whether $T'(\\delta)$ is sufficiently negative to satisfy $|T'(\\delta)| > E/L$. A cohesive law can be strictly decreasing but have a very steep initial slope. For example, $T(\\delta) = T_{max} \\exp(-\\alpha \\delta)$ has $T'(\\delta) = -\\alpha T_{max} \\exp(-\\alpha \\delta)$, which is always negative. At $\\delta=0$, the slope magnitude is $|T'(0)| = \\alpha T_{max}$. If $\\alpha T_{max} > E/L$, snap-back will occur from the very beginning of the process. The reasoning provided in the statement is flawed, and the conclusion is false.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{ABCD}$$", "id": "2632178"}, {"introduction": "While cohesive laws effectively model the process of fracture under tension, a robust numerical implementation must also account for what happens when crack faces come into contact under compression.

Numerical methods typically approximate or enforce these conditions.\n\n#### Analysis of Option A\n\n- **Proposed Law**: $t_{n}(g_{n}) = t_{n}^{\\mathrm{coh}}(\\langle g_{n}\\rangle) + k_{p}\\,g_{n}\\,H(-g_{n})$, with tangential traction $t_t = 0$ for $g_n \\le 0$. The Macaulay bracket is $\\langle x\\rangle = \\max(x,0)$ and $H(\\cdot)$ is the Heaviside step function.\n- **Evaluation of the Law**:\n    - For opening ($g_n > 0$): $H(-g_n) = 0$ and $\\langle g_n \\rangle = g_n$. The law becomes $t_n(g_n) = t_n^{\\mathrm{coh}}(g_n)$. This correctly reproduces the cohesive behavior.\n    - For compression/penetration ($g_n < 0$): $\\langle g_n \\rangle = 0$ and $H(-g_n) = 1$. The law becomes $t_n(g_n) = t_n^{\\mathrm{coh}}(0) + k_p g_n$. Typically, a cohesive law has $t_n^{\\mathrm{coh}}(0)=0$. Thus, $t_n(g_n) = k_p g_n$. Since $k_p > 0$ and $g_n < 0$, the resulting traction is compressive ($t_n < 0$), resisting interpenetration. This is the classical penalty method for contact. It allows a small penetration $g_n = t_n/k_p$. The condition $g_n \\ge 0$ is satisfied approximately; as $k_p \\to \\infty$, $g_n \\to 0$ for any finite contact pressure. The frictionless condition $t_t=0$ is correctly stated. This is a valid method.\n- **Evaluation of the Algorithmic Tangent**:\n    - The proposed tangent is $\\dfrac{\\partial t_{n}}{\\partial g_{n}} = t_{n}^{\\mathrm{coh}\\,\\prime}(\\langle g_{n}\\rangle)H(g_{n}) + k_{p}\\,H(-g_{n})$.\n    - Differentiating the proposed law term by term (in a distributional sense, suitable for semi-smooth Newton methods):\n        - $\\dfrac{\\partial}{\\partial g_n} \\left[t_{n}^{\\mathrm{coh}}(\\langle g_{n}\\rangle)\\right] = t_{n}^{\\mathrm{coh}\\,\\prime}(\\langle g_{n}\\rangle) \\dfrac{\\partial\\langle g_{n}\\rangle}{\\partial g_n} = t_{n}^{\\mathrm{coh}\\,\\prime}(\\langle g_{n}\\rangle)H(g_n)$.\n        - $\\dfrac{\\partial}{\\partial g_n} \\left[k_{p}\\,g_{n}\\,H(-g_{n})\\right] = k_{p}H(-g_{n}) + k_{p}g_{n}\\dfrac{\\partial H(-g_{n})}{\\partial g_n} = k_{p}H(-g_{n}) - k_{p}g_{n}\\delta(g_n)$. The term $g_n\\delta(g_n)$ is zero.\n    - Combining these results yields the exact tangent provided in the option.\n    - For opening ($g_n > 0$), the tangent is $t_{n}^{\\mathrm{coh}\\,\\prime}(g_n)$.\n    - For active contact ($g_n < 0$), the tangent is $k_p$.\n- **Evaluation of Properties**: The description is entirely correct. The tangent is piecewise defined. In the active contact set ($g_n < 0$), the normal stiffness is $k_p > 0$, which gives a symmetric positive-definite contribution to the element stiffness matrix. There is a \"kink\" at $g_n = 0$ where the derivative is discontinuous (unless $t_n^{\\mathrm{coh}\\,\\prime}(0) = k_p$), which requires a non-smooth solver strategy like an active-set method.\n- **Verdict**: **Correct**. Option A correctly describes the penalty method for contact coupled with a cohesive law.\n\n#### Analysis of Option B\n\n- **Proposed Law**: $t_{n}(g_{n}) = t_{n}^{\\mathrm{coh}}(|g_{n}|)$.\n- **Evaluation of the Law**:\n    - For opening ($g_n > 0$): $|g_n| = g_n$, so $t_n(g_n) = t_n^{\\mathrm{coh}}(g_n)$. Correct.\n    - For compression ($g_n < 0$): $|g_n| = -g_n > 0$. The law evaluates the cohesive traction at a positive separation value, resulting in a tensile traction ($t_n = t_n^{\\mathrm{coh}}(-g_n) > 0$). This is physically nonsensical. Contact must produce a compressive reaction ($t_n \\le 0$) to resist interpenetration. This law would pull the surfaces into each other upon compression. It fails to enforce non-penetration.\n- **Evaluation of the Algorithmic Tangent**:\n    - The derivative is $\\dfrac{\\partial t_n}{\\partial g_n} = t_{n}^{\\mathrm{coh}\\,\\prime}(|g_n|) \\cdot \\text{sgn}(g_n)$. The claim that the tangent is \"identical to the cohesive tangent everywhere\" is false; for $g_n < 0$, the tangent is $-t_{n}^{\\mathrm{coh}\\,\\prime}(-g_n)$. The claim of smoothness across $g_n=0$ is also false, as the $\\text{sgn}(g_n)$ function causes a jump discontinuity unless $t_{n}^{\\mathrm{coh}\\,\\prime}(0) = 0$.\n- **Verdict**: **Incorrect**. The proposed law is physically wrong for compression and does not enforce non-penetration. The description of the tangent is also erroneous.\n\n#### Analysis of Option C\n\n- **Proposed Law**: An augmented Lagrangian formulation for contact, combined with the cohesive law. The essential idea is to introduce a Lagrange multiplier field $\\lambda_n$ to enforce the contact constraint. The total traction is a sum of cohesive, penalty, and multiplier contributions, active in different regimes. The formulation is given as $t_{n}(g_{n},\\lambda_{n}) = t_{n}^{\\mathrm{coh}}\\!\\left(\\langle g_{n}\\rangle\\right) - \\lambda_{n}\\,H(-g_{n}) + k_{p}\\,g_{n}\\,H(-g_{n})$, supplemented by complementarity conditions.\n- **Evaluation of the Law**: This formulation correctly separates the response. For opening ($g_n > 0$), it reduces to the cohesive law $t_n = t_n^{\\mathrm{coh}}(g_n)$. For active contact ($g_n < 0$), it gives $t_n \\approx -\\lambda_n + k_p g_n$, where $\\lambda_n$ is the Lagrange multiplier (contact pressure) and $k_p g_n$ is a penalty/augmentation term. The purpose of this formulation is to solve for a state $(\\boldsymbol{u}, \\lambda_n)$ that satisfies the variational principle and the KKT (Karush-Kuhn-Tucker) conditions for contact, which are $g_n \\ge 0$, $\\lambda_n \\ge 0$, and $\\lambda_n g_n = 0$. Unlike the pure penalty method, this formulation can satisfy $g_n=0$ exactly in the contact zone for a finite $k_p$ by adjusting $\\lambda_n$. This is a standard and powerful method.\n- **Evaluation of the Algorithmic Tangent and System**: This is a primal-dual (or mixed) formulation, where unknowns include both displacements (primal variables, related to $g_n$) and Lagrange multipliers (dual variables, $\\lambda_n$). The global tangent matrix (Jacobian) for the Newton-Raphson solver will contain blocks for the coupling between these variables. The derivative of the traction-like terms with respect to primal variables (displacements) gives the stiffness part $\\mathbf{K}_{uu}$, while derivatives with respect to dual variables ($\\lambda_n$) give the coupling block $\\mathbf{K}_{u\\lambda}$. The additional equations for the multipliers give $\\mathbf{K}_{\\lambda u}$ and $\\mathbf{K}_{\\lambda\\lambda}$. The resulting system matrix is symmetric but indefinite, a hallmark of saddle-point problems arising from constrained optimization. The effective normal stiffness in the primal block is indeed $\\partial t_n / \\partial g_n = k_p$ for the active contact set. The transition at $g_n=0$ is non-smooth and requires special handling (active-set or semi-smooth methods). The statement that it can exactly eliminate interpenetration is the key advantage of this method over the penalty method.\n- **Verdict**: **Correct**. Option C provides an accurate high-level description of the augmented Lagrangian method for contact, correctly identifying its key features: the use of Lagrange multipliers, the ability to enforce constraints exactly, and the symmetric indefinite nature of the linearized system.\n\n#### Analysis of Option D\n\n- **Proposed Law**: $t_{n}(g_{n}) = t_{n}^{\\mathrm{coh}}(g_{n})$ for $g_{n} \\ge 0$, and $t_{n}(g_{n}) = 0$ for $g_{n} < 0$.\n- **Evaluation of the Law**: This law states that if the surfaces try to interpenetrate ($g_n < 0$), the resisting traction is zero. This allows for free, unlimited interpenetration, which is physically unacceptable and directly violates the problem's goal of enforcing non-penetration. The justification that \"no normal traction is applied under compression\" prevents interpenetration is a logical fallacy; the absence of a resisting force *allows* penetration.\n- **Evaluation of the Algorithmic Tangent**: The tangent stiffness for compression ($g_n < 0$) would be $\\partial t_n / \\partial g_n = 0$. This means the interface would offer no resistance to closing, which can lead to numerical instability and physically meaningless results. The claim that it \"preserves the cohesive element stiffness\" is false; it sets the normal stiffness to zero.\n- **Verdict**: **Incorrect**. The proposed law fails to achieve its stated purpose and is based on flawed physical reasoning.\n\n### Conclusion\nOptions A and C both describe valid, albeit different, standard numerical strategies for incorporating frictionless contact into a cohesive element. Option A describes the penalty method, which is approximate but simple. Option C describes the augmented Lagrangian method, which is more complex but can be exact. Both descriptions of the methods and their numerical consequences are correct. Option B is physically nonsensical, and Option D fails to enforce the non-penetration constraint. Since the problem asks to select all that apply, both A and C are correct.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{AC}$$", "id": "2632215"}]}
