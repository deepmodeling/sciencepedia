An intrinsic, zero-thickness cohesive interface is inserted across a single cross-section at midspan. The cohesive traction–separation relation is assumed to be any of three common parametric forms used in cohesive zone modeling for fracture—bilinear, trapezoidal, or exponential—but in all cases it is smooth at the origin with the same initial tangent stiffness $K_{0}$ (traction per unit separation). Assume the loading is such that the separation remains in the initial linear regime of the traction–separation law.\n\nLet the “global initial tangent stiffness” be the ratio of the axial force to the total end-to-end displacement as the force tends to zero.
