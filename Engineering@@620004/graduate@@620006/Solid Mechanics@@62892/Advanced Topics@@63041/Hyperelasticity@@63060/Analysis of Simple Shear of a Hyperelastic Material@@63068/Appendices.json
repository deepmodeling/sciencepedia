The value of $p^{(N)}$ on each element is determined by enforcing the traction-free boundary condition $\\sigma_{22}=0$ exactly at the element's center.\n\nThe performance of this approximation is measured by the $L_2$-norm of the resulting residual in the normal stress component $\\sigma_{22}$ over the domain $[0, H]$. The residual stress is given by\n$$\n\\sigma_{22}^{(N)}(x_{2}) = -p^{(N)}(x_{2})+2C_{1}-2C_{2}\\left(1+\\gamma(x_{2})^{2}\\right)\n$$\nThe exact pressure that nullifies this stress pointwise is $p_{\\text{exact}}(x_{2})=2C_{1}-2C_{2}\\left(1+\\gamma(x_{2})^{2}\\right)$. The approximate pressure on an element with center $x_{2,c}$ is $p^{(N)}|_{\\text{element}} = 2C_{1}-2C_{2}\\left(1+\\gamma(x_{2,c})^{2}\\right)$.\nThus, the residual stress can be expressed as the difference between the exact and approximate pressures:\n$$\n\\sigma_{22}^{(N)}(x_{2}) = p_{\\text{exact}}(x_2) - p^{(N)}(x_2)\n$$\nSubstituting the expressions for the pressures, we find that the material parameter $C_1$ cancels:\n$$\n\\sigma_{22}^{(N)}(x_{2}) = \\left[2C_{1}-2C_{2}\\left(1+\\gamma(x_{2})^{2}\\right)\\right] - \\left[2C_{1}-2C_{2}\\left(1+\\gamma(x_{2,c})^{2}\\right)\\right] = 2C_{2} \\left[ \\gamma(x_{2,c})^{2} - \\gamma(x_{2})^{2} \\right]\n$$\nThe total residual, $r_N$, is the square root of the integral of the square of this quantity over the domain:\n$$\nr_{N} = \\left( \\int_{0}^{H} \\left( 2C_{2} \\left[ \\gamma(x_{2,c}(x_2))^{2} - \\gamma(x_{2})^{2} \\right] \\right)^{2} dx_{2} \\right)^{1/2}\n$$\nwhere $x_{2,c}(x_2)$ denotes the center of the element containing $x_2$.\n\nTo compute this, we discretize the domain $[0, H]$ into $N$ elements of equal width $h = H/N$. The integral is a sum of integrals over each element:\n$$\nr_{N}^{2} = \\sum_{k=0}^{N-1} \\int_{kh}^{(k+1)h} \\left( 2C_{2} \\right)^{2} \\left[ \\gamma\\left(\\left(k+\\frac{1}{2}\\right)h\\right)^{2} - \\gamma(x_{2})^{2} \\right]^{2} dx_{2}\n$$\nEach integral over an element is computed numerically using a Gauss-Legendre quadrature of order $9$ ($5$ points), which satisfies the problem's requirement of being at least order $5$.\n\nThe analysis concerns the rate at which $r_N$ decreases as $N$ increases. For a piecewise constant approximation of a smooth function based on midpoint evaluation, the error is of order $\\mathcal{O}(h)$. The $L_2$-norm of this error, which corresponds to our residual $r_N$, is expected to be of order $\\mathcal{O}(h)$, or $\\mathcal{O}(1/N)$. Thus, we anticipate $r_N \\approx C/N$ for some constant $C$. The ratio $r_N/r_{2N}$ should then approach $2$. The order of convergence, computed as\n$$\nq_{N\\rightarrow 2N}=\\frac{\\log\\left(r_{N}/r_{2N}\\right)}{\\log(2)}\n$$\nis therefore expected to be approximately $1$ for the test cases where the shear distribution $\\gamma(x_2)$ is not constant.\n\nFor the special case where $B=0$, $\\gamma(x_2)$ is constant. Consequently, $\\gamma(x_{2,c}) = \\gamma(x_2)$ everywhere, the integrand is identically zero, and $r_N = 0$ for all $N$. In this situation, the condition $r_{16} < 10^{-14}$ and $r_{32} < 10^{-14}$ is met, and the convergence order is assigned the sentinel value $q_{16\\rightarrow 32} = 999.0$, as specified.\n\nThe implementation will proceed by calculating $r_{16}$ and $r_{32}$ for each test case and then computing $q_{16\\rightarrow 32}$ using the provided formula and special condition.", "answer": "```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy.integrate import fixed_quad\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Computes the order of convergence for a numerical approximation \n    in a hyperelastic simple shear problem for four test cases.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    test_cases = [\n        # H (m), C1 (Pa), C2 (Pa), A (-), B (-), m (-)\n        {'H': 1.0, 'C1': 80e3, 'C2': 20e3, 'A': 0.5, 'B': 0.3, 'm': 1},\n        {'H': 1.0, 'C1': 50e3, 'C2': 5e3, 'A': 1.2, 'B': 0.4, 'm': 2},\n        {'H': 1.0, 'C1': 30e3, 'C2': 10e3, 'A': 0.7, 'B': 0.0, 'm': 1},\n        {'H': 1.0, 'C1': 100e3, 'C2': 50e3, 'A': 2.0, 'B': 0.8, 'm': 3},\n    ]\n\n    results = []\n    \n    for case in test_cases:\n        # The parameter C1 is not needed for the residual calculation as it cancels out.\n        r_16 = calculate_residual(16, case['H'], case['C2'], case['A'], case['B'], case['m'])\n        r_32 = calculate_residual(32, case['H'], case['C2'], case['A'], case['B'], case['m'])\n\n        if r_16 < 1e-14 and r_32 < 1e-14:\n            q = 999.0\n        else:\n            if r_32 > 0:\n                ratio = r_16 / r_32\n                q = np.log(ratio) / np.log(2.0)\n            else:\n                # This case implies infinite convergence if r_16 was not already near zero.\n                # Assigning the sentinel value is a reasonable choice.\n                q = 999.0\n        results.append(q)\n\n    # Format the output as a comma-separated list in square brackets.\n    print(f\"[{','.join(map(str, results))}]\")\n\ndef calculate_residual(N, H, C2, A, B, m):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the residual error r_N for a given mesh size N and problem parameters.\n    \"\"\"\n    if C2 == 0:\n        return 0.0\n\n    h = H / N\n    total_integral_sq = 0.0\n    \n    m_pi_over_H = m * np.pi / H\n\n    def gamma_sq(x):\n        return (A + B * np.sin(m_pi_over_H * x))**2\n\n    for i in range(N):\n        x_start = i * h\n        x_end = (i + 1) * h\n        x_center = (x_start + x_end) / 2.0\n        \n        gamma_center_sq_val = gamma_sq(x_center)\n        \n        def integrand_func(x):\n            return (gamma_center_sq_val - gamma_sq(x))**2\n\n        # Use 5-point Gauss-Legendre quadrature (exact for polynomials up to degree 9)\n        # This satisfies the \"at least order 5\" requirement.\n        element_integral, _ = fixed_quad(integrand_func, x_start, x_end, n=5)\n        total_integral_sq += element_integral\n            \n    residual = 2.0 * C2 * np.sqrt(total_integral_sq)\n    return residual\n\nsolve()\n```", "id": "2614381"}]}
