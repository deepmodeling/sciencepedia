Let's compute the numerator and denominator using our derived increments (with $d\\lambda_1 > 0$):\n$$ d\\varepsilon_v^p = 2d\\lambda_1 + (-d\\lambda_1 N_\\phi) + (-d\\lambda_1 N_\\phi) = 2d\\lambda_1(1-N_\\phi) $$\n$$ \\sum |d\\varepsilon_i^p| = |2d\\lambda_1| + |-d\\lambda_1 N_\\phi| + |-d\\lambda_1 N_\\phi| = 2d\\lambda_1 + 2d\\lambda_1 N_\\phi = 2d\\lambda_1(1+N_\\phi) $$\nNote that for $\\phi > 0$, $N_\\phi > 1$, so $d\\varepsilon_v^p$ is negative, as expected for dilatant behavior. The ratio becomes:\n$$ \\sin\\psi = -\\frac{2d\\lambda_1(1-N_\\phi)}{2d\\lambda_1(1+N_\\phi)} = \\frac{N_\\phi - 1}{N_\\phi + 1} $$\nNow, we recall the definition of $N_\\phi = \\frac{1+\\sin\\phi}{1-\\sin\\phi}$. Substituting this into our expression for $\\sin\\psi$:\n$$ \\frac{N_\\phi - 1}{N_\\phi + 1} = \\frac{\\frac{1+\\sin\\phi}{1-\\sin\\phi} - 1}{\\frac{1+\\sin\\phi}{1-\\sin\\phi} + 1} = \\frac{(1+\\sin\\phi) - (1-\\sin\\phi)}{(1+\\sin\\phi) + (1-\\sin\\phi)} = \\frac{2\\sin\\phi}{2} = \\sin\\phi $$\nTherefore, we have proven that $\\sin\\psi = \\sin\\phi$. Since the mapping $\\phi \\mapsto \\sin\\phi$ is strictly monotonic for $\\phi \\in [0, \\pi/2)$, it follows that $\\psi = \\phi$. This completes the proof for Part (a).\n\nPart (b): Calculation\n\nWe are given a drained triaxial test on a perfectly plastic material with $\\phi = 30^{\\circ}$ and associated flow. The confining stresses are held constant, so $d\\sigma_2 = d\\sigma_3 = 0$. A total axial strain increment $d\\varepsilon_1 = 1.0 \\times 10^{-3}$ is imposed.\nSince the material is perfectly plastic, the stress state must remain on the yield surface during plastic flow. This requires the consistency condition $df = 0$. The relevant yield surface is $f(\\sigma_1, \\sigma_3) = \\sigma_1 - N_\\phi \\sigma_3 - 2c\\sqrt{N_\\phi} = 0$.\nThe increment of the yield function is:\n$$ df = \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial \\sigma_1}d\\sigma_1 + \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial \\sigma_3}d\\sigma_3 = (1)d\\sigma_1 + (-N_\\phi)d\\sigma_3 = 0 $$\nGiven $d\\sigma_3 = 0$, the consistency condition implies $d\\sigma_1 = 0$.\nWith $d\\sigma_1 = d\\sigma_2 = d\\sigma_3 = 0$, all components of the stress increment tensor $d\\sigma_{ij}$ are zero.\nThe total strain increment is the sum of elastic and plastic parts: $d\\varepsilon_{ij} = d\\varepsilon_{ij}^e + d\\varepsilon_{ij}^p$.\nThe elastic strain increment is given by Hooke's law, $d\\varepsilon_{ij}^e = C_{ijkl}^{-1} d\\sigma_{kl}$. Since $d\\sigma_{kl} = 0$, the elastic strain increment is zero: $d\\varepsilon_{ij}^e = 0$.\nTherefore, the total strain increment is entirely plastic: $d\\varepsilon_{ij} = d\\varepsilon_{ij}^p$.\nThe given axial strain increment is thus the plastic axial strain increment:\n$$ d\\varepsilon_1^p = d\\varepsilon_1 = 1.0 \\times 10^{-3} $$\nFrom the associated flow rule derived in Part (a), we have the ratio of plastic strain increments:\n$$ \\frac{d\\varepsilon_3^p}{d\\varepsilon_1^p} = \\frac{-d\\lambda_1 N_\\phi}{2d\\lambda_1} = -\\frac{N_\\phi}{2} $$\nFor $\\phi = 30^{\\circ}$, we have $\\sin(30^{\\circ}) = 0.5$.\n$$ N_\\phi = \\frac{1 + \\sin(30^{\\circ})}{1 - \\sin(30^{\\circ})} = \\frac{1+0.5}{1-0.5} = \\frac{1.5}{0.5} = 3 $$\nSo, the lateral plastic strain increment is:\n$$ d\\varepsilon_3^p = -\\frac{3}{2} d\\varepsilon_1^p = -1.5 \\times (1.0 \\times 10^{-3}) = -1.5 \\times 10^{-3} $$\nBy axisymmetry, $d\\varepsilon_2^p = d\\varepsilon_3^p$.\nThe plastic volumetric strain increment, $d\\varepsilon_v^p$, is the sum of the principal plastic strain increments:\n$$ d\\varepsilon_v^p = d\\varepsilon_1^p + d\\varepsilon_2^p + d\\varepsilon_3^p = d\\varepsilon_1^p + 2d\\varepsilon_3^p $$\n$$ d\\varepsilon_v^p = (1.0 \\times 10^{-3}) + 2(-1.5 \\times 10^{-3}) = 1.0 \\times 10^{-3} - 3.0 \\times 10^{-3} = -2.0 \\times 10^{-3} $$\nThe negative sign indicates dilation (volume increase), which is consistent with the compression-positive sign convention and a non-zero friction angle.\nThe final numerical answer, rounded to four significant figures, is $-0.002000$.", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{-0.002000} $$", "id": "2674241"}]}
