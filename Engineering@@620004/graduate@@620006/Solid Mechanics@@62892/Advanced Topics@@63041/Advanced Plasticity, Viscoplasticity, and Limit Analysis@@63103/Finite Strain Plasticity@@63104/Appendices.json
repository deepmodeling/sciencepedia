The first Piola-Kirchhoff stress is given as $P = \\tau/\\lambda$. Using the quotient rule for differentiation with respect to $\\lambda$:\n$$ K_{\\mathrm{alg}}^{\\mathrm{F}} = \\frac{d P}{d \\lambda} = \\frac{1}{\\lambda}\\frac{d\\tau}{d\\lambda} - \\frac{\\tau}{\\lambda^2} $$\nTo find $\\frac{d\\tau}{d\\lambda}$, we use the constitutive relations and the consistency condition for the finite strain model. During plastic loading, the yield condition is active: $\\phi = \\tau - (\\tau_{y0} + H\\varepsilon_p) = 0$. The rate form is $d\\phi = 0$:\n$$ d\\tau - H d\\varepsilon_p = 0 \\implies d\\tau = H d\\varepsilon_p $$\nThe Kirchhoff stress is also given by the elastic law $\\tau = E\\varepsilon_e = E(\\varepsilon - \\varepsilon_p) = E(\\ln\\lambda - \\varepsilon_p)$. Differentiating this with respect to $\\lambda$ yields:\n$$ \\frac{d\\tau}{d\\lambda} = E \\left(\\frac{1}{\\lambda} - \\frac{d\\varepsilon_p}{d\\lambda}\\right) $$\nWe have a system of two equations for the rates $\\frac{d\\tau}{d\\lambda}$ and $\\frac{d\\varepsilon_p}{d\\lambda}$. From the consistency condition, $\\frac{d\\varepsilon_p}{d\\lambda} = \\frac{1}{H}\\frac{d\\tau}{d\\lambda}$.

Yield occurs when the stress from purely elastic deformation reaches $\\tau_{y0}$. In the elastic range, $\\varepsilon_p = 0$, so $\\tau = E\\varepsilon_e = E\\ln\\lambda$. The stretch at yield, $\\lambda_y$, is found by setting $\\tau = \\tau_{y0}$:\n$$ E \\ln\\lambda_y = \\tau_{y0} \\implies \\lambda_y = \\exp\\left(\\frac{\\tau_{y0}}{E}\\right) $$\nUsing the given values, $\\frac{\\tau_{y0}}{E} = \\frac{0.300\\,\\mathrm{GPa}}{210\\,\\mathrm{GPa}} = \\frac{1}{700}$.\n$$ \\lambda_y = \\exp\\left(\\frac{1}{700}\\right) \\approx 1.00143 $$\nSince the final stretch $\\lambda=1.20$ is greater than $\\lambda_y$, the material is in the plastic regime.\n\nTo find the stress $\\tau$ at $\\lambda = 1.20$, we solve the system of equations defined by the yield condition and the constitutive law:\n1. $\\tau = \\tau_{y0} + H\\varepsilon_p$\n2. $\\tau = E(\\ln\\lambda - \\varepsilon_p)$\nEquating the expressions for $\\tau$:\n$$ \\tau_{y0} + H\\varepsilon_p = E\\ln\\lambda - E\\varepsilon_p $$\nSolving for the plastic strain $\\varepsilon_p$:\n$$ (E+H)\\varepsilon_p = E\\ln\\lambda - \\tau_{y0} \\implies \\varepsilon_p = \\frac{E\\ln\\lambda - \\tau_{y0}}{E+H} $$\nSubstituting this expression for $\\varepsilon_p$ back into the yield condition to find $\\tau$:\n$$ \\tau = \\tau_{y0} + H\\left(\\frac{E\\ln\\lambda - \\tau_{y0}}{E+H}\\right) = \\frac{\\tau_{y0}(E+H) + H(E\\ln\\lambda - \\tau_{y0})}{E+H} $$\n$$ \\tau = \\frac{E\\tau_{y0} + HE\\ln\\lambda}{E+H} = \\frac{E}{E+H}\\tau_{y0} + \\frac{EH}{E+H}\\ln\\lambda = \\frac{E}{E+H}\\tau_{y0} + E_{t}^{\\mathrm{S}}\\ln\\lambda $$\nThe desired ratio is $r = \\frac{K_{\\mathrm{alg}}^{\\mathrm{F}}}{E_{t}^{\\mathrm{S}}}$. Substituting the derived expressions:\n$$ r = \\frac{(E_{t}^{\\mathrm{S}}-\\tau)/\\lambda^2}{E_{t}^{\\mathrm{S}}} = \\frac{1}{\\lambda^2}\\left(1 - \\frac{\\tau}{E_{t}^{\\mathrm{S}}}\\right) $$\nWe can simplify the term $\\frac{\\tau}{E_{t}^{\\mathrm{S}}}$ using our expression for $\\tau$:\n$$ \\frac{\\tau}{E_{t}^{\\mathrm{S}}} = \\frac{\\frac{E}{E+H}\\tau_{y0} + E_{t}^{\\mathrm{S}}\\ln\\lambda}{E_{t}^{\\mathrm{S}}} = \\left(\\frac{E}{E+H}\\tau_{y0}\\right)\\frac{1}{E_{t}^{\\mathrm{S}}} + \\ln\\lambda $$\nSince $E_{t}^{\\mathrm{S}} = \\frac{EH}{E+H}$, its inverse is $\\frac{1}{E_{t}^{\\mathrm{S}}} = \\frac{E+H}{EH}$.\n$$ \\frac{\\tau}{E_{t}^{\\mathrm{S}}} = \\left(\\frac{E}{E+H}\\tau_{y0}\\right)\\left(\\frac{E+H}{EH}\\right) + \\ln\\lambda = \\frac{\\tau_{y0}}{H} + \\ln\\lambda $$\nThis provides a simple expression for the ratio $r$:\n$$ r = \\frac{1}{\\lambda^2}\\left(1 - \\left(\\frac{\\tau_{y0}}{H} + \\ln\\lambda\\right)\\right) $$\nNow, we substitute the numerical values: $\\lambda = 1.20$, $\\tau_{y0} = 0.300\\,\\mathrm{GPa}$, and $H = 2\\,\\mathrm{GPa}$.\n$$ r = \\frac{1}{(1.20)^2}\\left(1 - \\left(\\frac{0.300}{2} + \\ln(1.20)\\right)\\right) $$\n$$ r = \\frac{1}{1.44}\\left(1 - (0.150 + 0.182321556...)\\right) $$\n$$ r = \\frac{1}{1.44}\\left(1 - 0.332321556...\\right) $$\n$$ r = \\frac{0.667678443...}{1.44} $$\n$$ r \\approx 0.46366558... $$\nRounding to four significant figures, the result is $0.4637$.\nThe ratio $r$ quantifies the combined effect of geometric softening (the term $-\\tau/\\lambda^2$ in $K_{\\mathrm{alg}}^{\\mathrm{F}}$) and kinematic scaling (the factor $1/\\lambda^2$) on the tangent modulus in the finite strain setting, compared to the purely material modulus $E_{t}^{\\mathrm{S}}$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.4637}$$", "id": "2640736"}, {"introduction": "At the heart of any modern computational plasticity code is the \"return mapping\" algorithm, an implicit scheme used to integrate the complex, nonlinear constitutive equations over a finite time step.

All necessary constitutive definitions, kinematic relations, and evolution equations are provided. The language is precise and devoid of subjective claims. The problem is directly related to the specified field of *finite strain plasticity* within *solid mechanics*. There are no internal contradictions or missing information that would prevent a rigorous derivation.\nBased on this analysis, the problem is deemed **valid**. I will now proceed with the solution.\n\nThe objective is to derive the scalar residual function $R(\\Delta\\gamma)$, which, when set to zero, determines the plastic multiplier increment $\\Delta\\gamma$ for a time step from $t_{n}$ to $t_{n+1}$. This is accomplished within the framework of an elastic predictor-plastic corrector algorithm, using a backward Euler integration scheme. We consider the case of plastic loading, where the trial state violates the yield condition.\n\nThe corrector phase begins with the state at $t_{n}$ and the trial state at $t_{n+1}$. The goal is to find the updated state at $t_{n+1}$ that satisfies the yield condition. The state variables to be updated are the Kirchhoff stress $\\boldsymbol{\\tau}_{n+1}$ and the equivalent plastic strain $\\bar{\\varepsilon}^{\\mathrm{p}}_{n+1}$. The unknown driving the update is $\\Delta\\gamma$.\n\nAccording to the backward Euler scheme and the problem's assumptions for associative $J_{2}$ plasticity with the given Neo-Hookean model, the deviatoric Kirchhoff stress $\\mathbf{s}_{n+1}$ is obtained by a radial return of the trial stress $\\mathbf{s}^{\\mathrm{tr}}$ in the deviatoric stress space. This update rule is given by:\n$$\n\\mathbf{s}_{n+1} = \\mathbf{s}^{\\mathrm{tr}} - 2\\mu\\Delta\\gamma \\mathbf{n}_{n+1}\n$$\nThe factor $2\\mu\\Delta\\gamma$ is the magnitude of the correction. The problem explicitly states the assumption that the direction of correction is that of the trial deviatoric stress, $\\mathbf{n}_{n+1} = \\mathbf{s}^{\\mathrm{tr}}/\\|\\mathbf{s}^{\\mathrm{tr}}\\|$.

Thus, the absolute value can be removed, leading to:\n$$\n\\|\\mathbf{s}_{n+1}\\| = \\|\\mathbf{s}^{\\mathrm{tr}}\\| - 2\\mu\\Delta\\gamma\n$$\nNext, we update the accumulated equivalent plastic strain $\\bar{\\varepsilon}^{\\mathrm{p}}$. The evolution is given by the hardening law $\\dot{\\bar\\varepsilon}^{\\mathrm{p}} = \\dot{\\gamma}$. Applying the backward Euler scheme to this rate equation gives:\n$$\n\\frac{\\bar{\\varepsilon}^{\\mathrm{p}}_{n+1} - \\bar{\\varepsilon}^{\\mathrm{p}}_{n}}{\\Delta t} = \\dot{\\gamma}_{n+1}\n$$\nwhere $\\Delta\\gamma = \\dot{\\gamma}_{n+1}\\Delta t$ is the plastic multiplier increment over the step.

Let the updated stress increment be written abstractly as $\\Delta \\boldsymbol{\\tau} = \\mathcal{G}(\\Delta \\boldsymbol{d}; \\mathbf{q}_n)$, where $\\Delta \\boldsymbol{d}$ is the total strain-like increment over $\\Delta t$ in the spatial configuration and $\\mathbf{q}_n$ denotes the internal variables at time $t_n$.

It describes a standard, albeit advanced, topic in computational solid mechanics. The terminology used—Kirchhoff stress, rate-of-deformation, return mapping, Newton's method, consistent tangent—is standard in the field. The setup is a formal abstraction of the computational procedures used in modern finite element analysis codes for problems involving material nonlinearity. The problem is self-contained and provides sufficient information to answer the conceptual question posed. No scientific, logical, or factual flaws are present.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. A detailed solution and evaluation of options will be performed.\n\n**Derivation of the Algorithmic Tangent Modulus and its Role**\n\nThe global equilibrium equations derived from a finite element discretization of the principle of virtual work can be written as a nonlinear system for the unknown nodal displacements $\\mathbf{u}$ at time $t_{n+1}$:\n$$\n\\mathbf{R}(\\mathbf{u}_{n+1}) = \\mathbf{F}_{\\text{ext}, n+1} - \\mathbf{F}_{\\text{int}}(\\mathbf{u}_{n+1}) = \\mathbf{0}\n$$\nHere, $\\mathbf{F}_{\\text{ext}, n+1}$ is the vector of external nodal forces and $\\mathbf{F}_{\\text{int}}(\\mathbf{u}_{n+1})$ is the vector of internal nodal forces, which depends on the stress state at $t_{n+1}$. The internal force vector is assembled from element contributions, typically of the form:\n$$\n\\mathbf{f}_{\\text{int}}^e = \\int_{\\Omega_{e, n+1}} \\mathbf{B}^T \\boldsymbol{\\sigma}_{n+1} \\, dV\n$$\nwhere $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}_{n+1}$ is the Cauchy stress tensor and $\\mathbf{B}$ is the discrete strain-displacement matrix. The problem is posed in terms of Kirchhoff stress $\\boldsymbol{\\tau} = J \\boldsymbol{\\sigma}$, where $J = \\det(\\mathbf{F})$. The fundamental dependency remains: the internal forces depend on the updated stress state, which in turn depends on the nodal displacements $\\mathbf{u}_{n+1}$.\n\nNewton's method solves $\\mathbf{R}(\\mathbf{u}) = \\mathbf{0}$ iteratively. Starting from an estimate $\\mathbf{u}^{(i)}$, a correction $\\delta \\mathbf{u}^{(i+1)}$ is found by solving the linear system:\n$$\n\\mathbf{K}_T^{(i)} \\delta \\mathbf{u}^{(i+1)} = -\\mathbf{R}(\\mathbf{u}^{(i)})\n$$\nwhere $\\mathbf{K}_T^{(i)} = \\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{R}}{\\partial \\mathbf{u}} \\Big|_{\\mathbf{u}^{(i)}}$ is the tangent stiffness matrix, or the Jacobian of the residual vector. The next iterate is then $\\mathbf{u}^{(i+1)} = \\mathbf{u}^{(i)} + \\delta \\mathbf{u}^{(i+1)}$. For the method to exhibit its characteristic asymptotic quadratic rate of convergence, the matrix $\\mathbf{K}_T^{(i)}$ used in the iteration must be the true Jacobian of the residual $\\mathbf{R}$.\n\nThe tangent stiffness matrix is the derivative of the residual:\n$$\n\\mathbf{K}_T = \\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{R}}{\\partial \\mathbf{u}} = -\\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{F}_{\\text{int}}}{\\partial \\mathbf{u}}\n$$\nApplying the chain rule to the element-wise integral, the essential component that emerges is the derivative of the stress tensor with respect to the kinematic variable driving the deformation. In the context of the discretized constitutive update, the stress at time $t_{n+1}$, $\\boldsymbol{\\tau}_{n+1}$, is a function of the strain-like increment for the step, $\\Delta \\boldsymbol{d}$. Let us denote this functional dependence as $\\boldsymbol{\\tau}_{n+1}(\\Delta \\boldsymbol{d})$. The strain increment $\\Delta \\boldsymbol{d}$ is itself a function of the nodal displacements $\\mathbf{u}_{n+1}$.\n\nThe crucial step is an exact linearization. The variation of the internal force vector requires the variation of the stress tensor, which is given by:\n$$\n\\delta \\boldsymbol{\\tau}_{n+1} = \\frac{\\partial \\boldsymbol{\\tau}_{n+1}}{\\partial (\\Delta \\boldsymbol{d})} : \\delta(\\Delta \\boldsymbol{d})\n$$\nThe fourth-order tensor that linearly relates the variation of the stress to the variation of the strain-like increment is defined as the **algorithmic tangent modulus**, $\\mathbb{C}_{\\text{alg}}$:\n$$\n\\mathbb{C}_{\\text{alg}} \\equiv \\frac{\\partial \\boldsymbol{\\tau}_{n+1}}{\\partial (\\Delta \\boldsymbol{d})}\n$$\nSince $\\boldsymbol{\\tau}_{n+1} = \\boldsymbol{\\tau}_n + \\Delta \\boldsymbol{\\tau}(\\Delta \\boldsymbol{d})$, and $\\boldsymbol{\\tau}_n$ is a constant from the previous converged step, this is equivalent to:\n$$\n\\mathbb{C}_{\\text{alg}} = \\frac{\\partial (\\Delta \\boldsymbol{\\tau})}{\\partial (\\Delta \\boldsymbol{d})} = \\frac{\\partial \\mathcal{G}(\\Delta \\boldsymbol{d}; \\mathbf{q}_n)}{\\partial (\\Delta \\boldsymbol{d})}\n$$\nThis derivative must be computed by differentiating through the entire discrete algorithm represented by the function $\\mathcal{G}$. This algorithm includes the elastic predictor step and the plastic corrector (return-mapping) step. In the return mapping, the updated internal variables $\\mathbf{q}_{n+1}$ are themselves functions of the trial state, and thus are implicit functions of $\\Delta \\boldsymbol{d}$. The differentiation must account for this dependency, i.e., it must be *consistent* with the integration algorithm.\n\nWhen this $\\mathbb{C}_{\\text{alg}}$ is used to build the material stiffness part of the global tangent matrix $\\mathbf{K}_T$, the resulting matrix is the exact Jacobian of the discretized global residual vector $\\mathbf{R}$. This is the necessary condition for Newton's method to achieve quadratic convergence near the solution.\n\n**Evaluation of Options**\n\n**A. $\\mathbb{C}_{\\text{alg}}$ is the continuum elastic stiffness tensor evaluated at the updated state, obtained as $\\mathbb{C}_{\\text{alg}} = \\mathbb{C}_{\\text{e}}$, where plastic corrections are ignored in the derivative. Using $\\mathbb{C}_{\\text{e}}$ guarantees quadratic convergence because Newton’s method requires only a symmetric Jacobian.**\nThis is incorrect. Using the elastic tangent modulus $\\mathbb{C}_{\\text{e}}$ when plastic deformation occurs means the tangent stiffness matrix $\\mathbf{K}_T$ is not the true Jacobian of the residual. This leads to a modified Newton method, which generally exhibits a linear rate of convergence, not quadratic. The assertion that only a symmetric Jacobian is needed for quadratic convergence is false; the Jacobian must be exact.\n\n**B. $\\mathbb{C}_{\\text{alg}}$ is the Jacobian of the discretized stress update with respect to the strain-like increment of the step, with the internal variables eliminated through the discrete plastic flow and consistency equations. In components, $\\mathbb{C}_{\\text{alg}} = \\partial \\Delta \\boldsymbol{\\tau} / \\partial \\Delta \\boldsymbol{d}$ evaluated with $\\mathbf{q}_{n+1}$ satisfying the return-mapping equations. When this Jacobian is used inside the global residual linearization, the resulting tangent equals the exact Jacobian of the discretized nonlinear system, which, under standard smoothness and regularity assumptions, yields quadratic convergence of Newton’s method.**\nThis is correct. It precisely defines the algorithmic tangent modulus as the linearization of the discrete constitutive update function, $\\mathbb{C}_{\\text{alg}} = \\partial (\\Delta \\boldsymbol{\\tau}) / \\partial (\\Delta \\boldsymbol{d})$. It correctly states that this derivative must be consistent with the return-mapping algorithm by implicitly accounting for the dependence of the final internal variables $\\mathbf{q}_{n+1}$ on the strain increment $\\Delta \\boldsymbol{d}$. Furthermore, it correctly identifies the consequence: using this specific tangent modulus makes the global tangent stiffness matrix the exact Jacobian of the global residual, which is the mathematical requirement for achieving the asymptotic quadratic convergence rate of Newton's method.\n\n**C. $\\mathbb{C}_{\\text{alg}}$ is defined as the secant modulus $\\mathbb{C}_{\\text{sec}} = \\Delta \\boldsymbol{\\tau} : (\\Delta \\boldsymbol{d})^{-1}$ formed a posteriori from the computed start and end states of the step. Using this secant modulus ensures at least superlinear and typically quadratic convergence for sufficiently small time steps.**\nThis is incorrect. First, the notation $\\Delta \\boldsymbol{\\tau} : (\\Delta \\boldsymbol{d})^{-1}$ is ambiguous for defining a fourth-order tensor. The intended definition is likely $\\Delta \\boldsymbol{\\tau} = \\mathbb{C}_{\\text{sec}} : \\Delta \\boldsymbol{d}$. This defines a secant modulus, not a tangent modulus. A tangent is a derivative, relating infinitesimal changes, while a secant relates finite increments. Using a secant stiffness leads to quasi-Newton methods (like Broyden's method), which typically converge superlinearly, but not quadratically. Quadratic convergence is the signature of a true Newton method using the exact tangent.\n\n**D. $\\mathbb{C}_{\\text{alg}}$ is obtained by differentiating the rate equation $\\dot{\\boldsymbol{\\tau}}$ with respect to $\\boldsymbol{d}$ while holding the plastic multiplier and internal variables fixed at their previous-step values, that is, $\\mathbb{C}_{\\text{alg}} = \\partial \\dot{\\boldsymbol{\\tau}} / \\partial \\boldsymbol{d}\\big|_{\\Delta \\gamma = 0,\\ \\Delta \\mathbf{q} = \\mathbf{0}}$. Because this matches the rate form, Newton’s method attains quadratic convergence.**\nThis is incorrect. This option confuses the algorithmic tangent with the continuum tangent. The algorithmic tangent is derived from the *integrated* form of the constitutive law, not the *rate* form ($\\dot{\\boldsymbol{\\tau}}$). Differentiating the rate equation gives the continuum tangent modulus. Using the continuum tangent in a finite-step implicit algorithm does not yield the exact Jacobian of the discretized system, and thus, quadratic convergence is lost. The condition given, $\\Delta \\gamma = 0$ (zero plastic multiplier increment), explicitly describes an elastic step, so this definition would simply collapse to the elastic tangent, which is incorrect as discussed for option A.\n\n**E. $\\mathbb{C}_{\\text{alg}}$ is any symmetric positive-definite fourth-order tensor chosen to stabilize the iterations. Quadratic convergence of Newton’s method depends only on symmetry and definiteness of the tangent, not on consistency with the discretized constitutive update.**\nThis is fundamentally incorrect. The convergence *rate* of Newton's method is critically dependent on how accurately the iterative matrix approximates the true Jacobian. Quadratic convergence requires the exact Jacobian. The properties of symmetry and positive-definiteness are desirable for the efficiency and robustness of the linear solver used within each Newton iteration, but they do not, by themselves, determine the convergence rate of the outer Newton loop. Any matrix other than the consistent tangent will, in general, destroy the quadratic convergence property.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2640753"}]}
