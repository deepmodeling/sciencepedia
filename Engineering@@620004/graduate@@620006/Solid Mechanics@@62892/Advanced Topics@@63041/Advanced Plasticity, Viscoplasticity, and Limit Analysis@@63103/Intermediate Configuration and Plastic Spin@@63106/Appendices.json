The first is a classical small-strain model, and the second is a finite-strain model based on the multiplicative decomposition of the deformation gradient.\n\nFirst, we analyze the small-strain description. In this framework, the total velocity gradient $l$ is additively decomposed into elastic and plastic parts. The plastic part is the plastic velocity gradient, $L^p$, which is itself decomposed into a symmetric part, the plastic rate of deformation $D^p$, and a skew-symmetric part, the plastic spin $W^p$. In the small-strain approximation, $D^p$ is identified with the rate of the plastic strain tensor, $\\dot{\\varepsilon}^p$. The problem states that the material obeys an associated $J_2$ flow rule. This rule, which takes the form $\\dot{\\varepsilon}^p = \\dot{\\lambda} \\frac{\\partial J_2}{\\partial \\sigma}$ for a scalar multiplier $\\dot{\\lambda}$ and stress tensor $\\sigma$, determines the plastic strain rate $\\dot{\\varepsilon}^p$ (i.e., $D^p$). However, the flow rule provides no information about the plastic spin $W^p$. For a material that is and remains isotropic during plastic flow, there is no development of any material directionality that would cause a plastic spin. Consequently, in the standard phenomenological theory of plasticity for isotropic materials, the plastic spin tensor is constitutively postulated to be zero. This is a fundamental assumption of the model, not a deduction from the flow rule alone. The problem statement guides us to this conclusion by defining the scalar spin $\\omega_p$ for the small-strain case in a manner consistent with the plastic spin tensor vanishing. Therefore, we have:\n$$ W^p = 0 $$\nThis implies that the scalar plastic spin, which is a component of this tensor, is also zero.\n$$ \\omega_p = 0 $$\n\nNext, we analyze the finite-strain description. This model is established on the multiplicative decomposition of the deformation gradient, $F = F^e F^p$, where $F^e$ is the elastic part and $F^p$ is the plastic part. The problem specifies a purely plastic deformation, meaning $F^e = I$ (the identity tensor), and provides the plastic deformation gradient for simple shear as:\n$$ F^p(t) = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & \\gamma(t) \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} $$\nThe plastic velocity gradient, $L^p$, is kinematically defined as $L^p = \\dot{F}^p (F^p)^{-1}$. We first compute the time derivative of $F^p$:\n$$ \\dot{F}^p(t) = \\frac{d}{dt} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & \\gamma(t) \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & \\dot{\\gamma}(t) \\\\ 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} $$\nWe then find the inverse of $F^p$:\n$$ (F^p(t))^{-1} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & -\\gamma(t) \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} $$\nNow, we can compute $L^p$ by matrix multiplication:\n$$ L^p = \\dot{F}^p (F^p)^{-1} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & \\dot{\\gamma} \\\\ 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & -\\gamma \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} (0)(1) + (\\dot{\\gamma})(0) & (0)(-\\gamma) + (\\dot{\\gamma})(1) \\\\ (0)(1) + (0)(0) & (0)(-\\gamma) + (0)(1) \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & \\dot{\\gamma} \\\\ 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} $$\nThis expression for $L^p$ is exact and does not contain any terms in $\\gamma$, so it is trivially the leading-order result.

For the original and gauge-rotated cases:\n$$F_{e}(t) = (\\lambda(t)I) (R_{z}(\\theta(t)))^{-1} = \\lambda(t) R_{z}(-\\theta(t))$$\n$$\\tilde{F}_{e}(t) = F(t) \\tilde{F}_{p}(t)^{-1} = (\\lambda(t)I) (R_{z}(\\phi(t)+\\theta(t)))^{-1} = \\lambda(t) R_{z}(-(\\phi(t)+\\theta(t)))$$\n\n1.  **Kirchhoff Stress $\\tau$**:\n    The Kirchhoff stress $\\tau$ is an isotropic function of the elastic left Cauchy-Green tensor $B_e = F_e F_e^T$. We compute $B_e$ and $\\tilde{B}_e$.\n    $$B_{e}(t) = F_{e}(t) F_{e}(t)^T = (\\lambda(t) R_{z}(-\\theta(t))) (\\lambda(t) R_{z}(-\\theta(t)))^T = \\lambda(t)^{2} R_{z}(-\\theta(t)) R_{z}(-\\theta(t))^T$$\n    Since $R_{z}$ is a rotation matrix, $R_{z}(-\\theta(t)) R_{z}(-\\theta(t))^T = I$. Thus,\n    $$B_{e}(t) = \\lambda(t)^{2} I = (1+t)^{2} I$$\n    Similarly for the gauge-rotated case:\n    $$\\tilde{B}_{e}(t) = \\tilde{F}_{e}(t) \\tilde{F}_{e}(t)^T = (\\lambda(t) R_{z}(-(\\phi+\\theta))) (\\lambda(t) R_{z}(-(\\phi+\\theta)))^T = \\lambda(t)^{2} I$$\n    We find that $\\tilde{B}_{e}(t) = B_{e}(t)$ for all $t$. Since $\\tau$ is a function of $B_e$, i.e., $\\tau = f(B_e)$, it follows immediately that $\\tilde{\\tau} = f(\\tilde{B}_e) = f(B_e) = \\tau$. The Kirchhoff stress history is therefore identical.\n\n2.  **Second Piola-Kirchhoff Stress $S$**:\n    The stress $S$ is given by $S = F_{p}^{-1} S_{e} F_{p}^{-T}$, where $S_e$ is an isotropic function of the elastic right Cauchy-Green tensor $C_e = F_e^T F_e$. We compute $C_e$ and $\\tilde{C}_e$.\n    $$C_{e}(t) = F_{e}(t)^T F_{e}(t) = (\\lambda(t) R_{z}(-\\theta(t)))^T (\\lambda(t) R_{z}(-\\theta(t))) = \\lambda(t)^{2} R_{z}(-\\theta(t))^T R_{z}(-\\theta(t))$$\n    Since $R_z$ is orthogonal, $R_{z}(-\\theta(t))^T R_{z}(-\\theta(t)) = R_z(\\theta(t)) R_z(-\\theta(t)) = R_z(0) = I$. Thus,\n    $$C_{e}(t) = \\lambda(t)^{2} I = (1+t)^{2} I$$\n    Similarly for the gauge-rotated case:\n    $$\\tilde{C}_{e}(t) = \\tilde{F}_{e}(t)^T \\tilde{F}_{e}(t) = (\\lambda(t) R_{z}(-(\\phi+\\theta)))^T (\\lambda(t) R_{z}(-(\\phi+\\theta))) = \\lambda(t)^{2} I$$\n    We find that $\\tilde{C}_{e}(t) = C_{e}(t)$. Since $S_e$ is a function of $C_e$, let's say $S_e = g(C_e)$, it follows that $\\tilde{S}_e = g(\\tilde{C}_e) = g(C_e) = S_e$.\n    Now we compute $S$ and $\\tilde{S}$:\n    $$S(t) = F_{p}(t)^{-1} S_{e}(t) F_{p}(t)^{-T}$$\n    $$ \\tilde{S}(t) = \\tilde{F}_{p}(t)^{-1} \\tilde{S}_{e}(t) \\tilde{F}_{p}(t)^{-T}$$\n    Since $C_e$ is an isotropic tensor ($C_e = cI$), any isotropic tensor function of $C_e$ must also be isotropic. Therefore, $S_e$ must be of the form $S_e = sI$ for some scalar function $s$. The same holds for $\\tilde{S}_e = S_e$.\n    Substituting $S_e = sI$ into the expression for $S$:\n    $$S(t) = R_z(\\theta)^{-1} (sI) (R_z(\\theta)^{-1})^T = s R_z(-\\theta) I R_z(\\theta) = s (R_z(-\\theta)R_z(\\theta)) = sI$$\n    For the gauge-rotated case:\n    $$\\tilde{S}(t) = \\tilde{F}_{p}^{-1} (sI) (\\tilde{F}_{p}^{-1})^T = s (\\tilde{F}_{p}^{-1} (\\tilde{F}_{p}^{-1})^T) = sI$$\n    Therefore, $\\tilde{S}(t) = S(t)$. The second Piola-Kirchhoff stress history is identical.\n\n3.  **Mandel Stress $M$**:\n    The Mandel stress is defined as $M = C_e S_e$. We compute $M$ and $\\tilde{M}$.\n    $$M(t) = C_{e}(t) S_{e}(t)$$\n    $$\\tilde{M}(t) = \\tilde{C}_{e}(t) \\tilde{S}_{e}(t)$$\n    From the previous analysis, we have established that $\\tilde{C}_{e}(t) = C_{e}(t)$ and $\\tilde{S}_{e}(t) = S_{e}(t)$. It follows directly that:\n    $$\\tilde{M}(t) = C_{e}(t) S_{e}(t) = M(t)$$\n    The Mandel stress history is identical. This completes the proof for Task 1. The invariance holds due to the specific kinematics of the problem, which ensure that the intermediate elastic strain measures $B_e$ and $C_e$ are isotropic tensors and are themselves invariant under the prescribed gauge transformation.\n\n**Task 2: Computation of Gauge-Rotated Plastic Spin $\\tilde{W}_{p}(t)$**\n\nThe plastic spin $W_p$ is the skew-symmetric part of the plastic velocity gradient $L_p = \\dot{F}_p F_{p}^{-1}$. For a plastic deformation that is a pure rotation, $F_p \\in \\mathrm{SO}(3)$, this simplifies to $W_p = \\dot{F}_p F_{p}^{T}$.\nWe are asked to compute the gauge-rotated plastic spin $\\tilde{W}_{p}(t)$. The gauge-rotated plastic deformation is:\n$$\\tilde{F}_{p}(t) = R_z(\\psi(t)) \\quad \\text{where} \\quad \\psi(t) = \\phi(t) + \\theta(t) = \\sin t + t^{2}$$\nSince $\\tilde{F}_{p}(t)$ is a pure rotation, we can use the simplified formula:\n$$\\tilde{W}_{p}(t) = \\dot{\\tilde{F}}_{p}(t) \\tilde{F}_{p}(t)^T$$\nFirst, we compute the time derivative of $\\tilde{F}_{p}(t)$ using the chain rule. Let $\\dot{\\psi}(t) = \\frac{d\\psi}{dt} = \\cos t + 2t$.\n$$\\tilde{F}_{p}(t) = \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos(\\psi(t)) & -\\sin(\\psi(t)) & 0 \\\\ \\sin(\\psi(t)) & \\cos(\\psi(t)) & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$$\n$$\\dot{\\tilde{F}}_{p}(t) = \\frac{d}{dt}\\tilde{F}_{p}(t) = \\dot{\\psi}(t) \\begin{pmatrix} -\\sin(\\psi(t)) & -\\cos(\\psi(t)) & 0 \\\\ \\cos(\\psi(t)) & -\\sin(\\psi(t)) & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$$\nThe transpose is:\n$$\\tilde{F}_{p}(t)^T = \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos(\\psi(t)) & \\sin(\\psi(t)) & 0 \\\\ -\\sin(\\psi(t)) & \\cos(\\psi(t)) & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$$\nNow, we perform the matrix multiplication $\\dot{\\tilde{F}}_{p}(t) \\tilde{F}_{p}(t)^T$:\n$$ \\tilde{W}_{p}(t) = \\dot{\\psi}(t) \\begin{pmatrix} -\\sin\\psi & -\\cos\\psi & 0 \\\\ \\cos\\psi & -\\sin\\psi & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos\\psi & \\sin\\psi & 0 \\\\ -\\sin\\psi & \\cos\\psi & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} $$\n$$ \\tilde{W}_{p}(t) = \\dot{\\psi}(t) \\begin{pmatrix} -\\sin\\psi\\cos\\psi + \\cos\\psi\\sin\\psi & -\\sin^2\\psi - \\cos^2\\psi & 0 \\\\ \\cos^2\\psi + \\sin^2\\psi & \\cos\\psi\\sin\\psi - \\sin\\psi\\cos\\psi & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} $$\nUsing the identity $\\sin^2\\psi + \\cos^2\\psi = 1$, the matrix simplifies to:\n$$ \\tilde{W}_{p}(t) = \\dot{\\psi}(t) \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & -1 & 0 \\\\ 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} $$\nSubstituting $\\dot{\\psi}(t) = \\cos t + 2t$:\n$$ \\tilde{W}_{p}(t) = (\\cos t + 2t) \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & -1 & 0 \\\\ 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & -(\\cos t + 2t) & 0 \\\\ \\cos t + 2t & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} $$\nThis expression represents the explicit $3 \\times 3$ matrix for the gauge-rotated plastic spin $\\tilde{W}_{p}(t)$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n0 & -(\\cos t + 2t) & 0 \\\\\n\\cos t + 2t & 0 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 0\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "2649681"}]}
