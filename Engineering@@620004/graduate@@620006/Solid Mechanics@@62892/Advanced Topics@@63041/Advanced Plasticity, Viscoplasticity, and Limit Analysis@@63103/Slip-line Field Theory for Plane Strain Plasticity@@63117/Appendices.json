Consequently, the stress tensor must also represent a state of pure shear, possibly superimposed with a hydrostatic pressure, as hydrostatic pressure does not affect shear components or plastic yielding in the Tresca model.

The radius of curvature of a circle is constant and equal to its radius. Thus, for an $\\alpha$-line, $R = r$.\nThe identity becomes:\n$$\nds_{\\alpha} = r d\\psi\n$$\nTo find the total arc length $s_{\\alpha}(r)$ of a segment, we integrate this expression between the start and end points of the segment.

We use the kinematic relation between the slip-line angle $\\psi$ and the principal stress angle $\\theta$:\n$$\n\\psi = \\theta \\pm \\frac{\\pi}{4}\n$$\nRegardless of the choice of sign, the change in $\\psi$ is equal to the change in $\\theta$:\n$$\nd\\psi = d\\theta \\implies \\Delta\\psi = \\Delta\\theta\n$$\nSubstituting this into our expression for the arc length:\n$$\ns_{\\alpha}(r) = r \\Delta\\theta\n$$\nThis is the required expression for the arc length of the $\\alpha$-line segment.\n\nFor completeness, we note the relation between the change in mean stress $\\Delta p$ and the angle rotation $\\Delta \\theta$ across the fan. From the Hencky relation derived in Part 1, along an $\\alpha$-line (constant $r$), $p+2k\\theta=\\text{constant}$. This relation holds for any point on a given $\\alpha$-line. If we consider two points on this line, $1$ and $2$, then $p_1+2k\\theta_1 = p_2+2k\\theta_2$. This means $p_2-p_1 = -2k(\\theta_2-\\theta_1)$, or $\\Delta p = -2k \\Delta\\theta$.\nThe question concerns the variation *across the fan*, which means moving from one $\\beta$-line to another. For the centered fan geometry, the angle $\\theta$ changes along the $\\alpha$-line. The relation is $p(\\theta_2)-p(\\theta_1) = -2k(\\theta_2-\\theta_1)$. The change in mean pressure $\\Delta p$ in the fan is directly proportional to the rotation $\\Delta\\theta$.

The stress components can be expressed in terms of $p$ and the angle $\\varphi$, which the first principal slip-line ($\\alpha$-line) makes with the $x$-axis:\n$$ \\sigma_{xx} = -p - k \\sin(2\\varphi) $$\n$$ \\sigma_{yy} = -p + k \\sin(2\\varphi) $$\n$$ \\sigma_{xy} =  k \\cos(2\\varphi) $$\nThese must satisfy the two-dimensional equilibrium equations without body forces, $\\frac{\\partial \\sigma_{ij}}{\\partial x_j} = 0$.\nSubstituting the stress expressions into the equilibrium equations and assuming $k$ is constant (homogeneous material), we obtain:\n1. $\\frac{\\partial \\sigma_{xx}}{\\partial x} + \\frac{\\partial \\sigma_{xy}}{\\partial y} = 0 \\implies -\\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial x} - 2k\\cos(2\\varphi)\\frac{\\partial\\varphi}{\\partial x} - 2k\\sin(2\\varphi)\\frac{\\partial\\varphi}{\\partial y} = 0$\n2. $\\frac{\\partial \\sigma_{yx}}{\\partial x} + \\frac{\\partial \\sigma_{yy}}{\\partial y} = 0 \\implies -2k\\sin(2\\varphi)\\frac{\\partial\\varphi}{\\partial x} - \\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial y} + 2k\\cos(2\\varphi)\\frac{\\partial\\varphi}{\\partial y} = 0$\nThis is a system of two first-order partial differential equations for $p(x,y)$ and $\\varphi(x,y)$.\n$$ \\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial x} + 2k\\left(\\cos(2\\varphi)\\frac{\\partial \\varphi}{\\partial x} + \\sin(2\\varphi)\\frac{\\partial \\varphi}{\\partial y}\\right) = 0 $$\n$$ \\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial y} + 2k\\left(\\sin(2\\varphi)\\frac{\\partial \\varphi}{\\partial x} - \\cos(2\\varphi)\\frac{\\partial \\varphi}{\\partial y}\\right) = 0 $$\nThis hyperbolic system has real characteristics, which are the slip-lines. To find them, we seek directions $m = dy/dx$ along which the PDEs reduce to ordinary differential equations (the compatibility relations). This condition leads to a quadratic equation for the characteristic slopes $m$:\n$$ m^{2}\\sin(2\\varphi) + 2m\\cos(2\\varphi) - \\sin(2\\varphi) = 0 $$\nThe roots of this equation are:\n$m_1 = \\tan(\\varphi)$, corresponding to the $\\alpha$-lines.\n$m_2 = -\\cot(\\varphi) = \\tan(\\varphi + \\pi/2)$, corresponding to the $\\beta$-lines.\nAlong these characteristic lines, the compatibility relations, known as Hencky's equations, are found. Along an $\\alpha$-line ($dy/dx = \\tan(\\varphi)$), we find $dp = -2k d\\varphi$, which integrates to:\n$$ p + 2k\\varphi = C_1 \\quad (\\text{along an } \\alpha \\text{-line}) $$\nAlong a $\\beta$-line ($dy/dx = -\\cot(\\varphi)$), we find $dp = 2k d\\varphi$, which integrates to:\n$$ p - 2k\\varphi = C_2 \\quad (\\text{along a } \\beta \\text{-line}) $$\nThese are the required characteristic equations.\n\nSecond, we use a non-dimensionalization argument. Let us define a normalized pressure $P = p/(2k)$. Hencky's equations become:\n$$ P + \\varphi = C_1 / (2k) = C_1^* \\quad (\\text{along an } \\alpha \\text{-line}) $$\n$$ P - \\varphi = C_2 / (2k) = C_2^* \\quad (\\text{along a } \\beta \\text{-line}) $$\nThe geometry of the slip-line field is governed by the angles $\\varphi$ and the boundary conditions. For Prandtl compression between perfectly rough platens, the slip-lines must meet the platens at $\\pm \\pi/4$. Any stress boundary conditions on free surfaces, for example $p=k$, become $P=1/2$ in normalized form. The entire boundary value problem for the dimensionless fields $P(x/H, y/H)$ and $\\varphi(x/H, y/H)$ is independent of the specific values of $H$ and $k$. Consequently, the solution field for the normalized pressure $p/(2k)$ is a universal function of normalized coordinates and does not depend on the magnitude of $k$.\n\nThird, we explain the mapping from uniaxial yield stress $\\sigma_y$ to the shear yield stress $k$. This mapping depends on the chosen yield criterion.\nFor the Tresca criterion, yielding occurs when the maximum shear stress equals $k_T$. In a uniaxial tensile test, the principal stresses are $(\\sigma_y, 0, 0)$, so the maximum shear stress is $\\tau_{\\max} = (\\sigma_y - 0)/2 = \\sigma_y/2$. Therefore, for Tresca:\n$$ k_T = \\frac{\\sigma_y}{2} $$\nFor the von Mises criterion, yielding occurs when the second invariant of the deviatoric stress tensor, $J_2$, reaches a critical value. From a uniaxial test, this value is $J_2 = \\sigma_y^2/3$. The slip-line field theory for a von Mises material under plane strain requires an effective shear yield stress, $k_{VM}$. For plane strain ($\\epsilon_z=0$) with the associated flow rule, one finds $\\sigma_z = (\\sigma_x+\\sigma_y)/2$, where $\\sigma_z$ is the out-of-plane stress. The von Mises criterion $J_2 = \\sigma_y^2/3$ then reduces to $\\frac{1}{4}(\\sigma_1-\\sigma_2)^2 = \\sigma_y^2/3$, where $\\sigma_1, \\sigma_2$ are the in-plane principal stresses. Since the maximum in-plane shear stress is defined as $k = (\\sigma_1-\\sigma_2)/2$, we have $(2k_{VM})^2/4 = \\sigma_y^2/3$, which gives:\n$$ k_{VM} = \\frac{\\sigma_y}{\\sqrt{3}} $$\n\nFinally, we deduce the ratio of the average platen pressures, $\\bar{p}_{\\text{Mises}}/\\bar{p}_{\\text{Tresca}}$.\nThe average pressure $\\bar{p}$ is the total load per unit thickness divided by the contact length. From our non-dimensionalization argument, the normalized average pressure $\\bar{p}/(2k)$ must be a constant, let us call it $C$, that depends only on the geometry of the problem (e.g., aspect ratio of the compressed region) and the boundary conditions (perfectly rough platens). The problem statement specifies the same geometry and boundary conditions for both cases.\n$$ \\frac{\\bar{p}}{2k} = C \\implies \\bar{p} = 2kC $$\nThe constant $C$ is identical for both Tresca and von Mises analyses. Therefore, the average pressures are:\n$$ \\bar{p}_{\\text{Tresca}} = 2k_T C $$\n$$ \\bar{p}_{\\text{Mises}} = 2k_{VM} C $$\nThe ratio is simply the ratio of the respective shear yield stresses:\n$$ \\frac{\\bar{p}_{\\text{Mises}}}{\\bar{p}_{\\text{Tresca}}} = \\frac{2k_{VM}C}{2k_T C} = \\frac{k_{VM}}{k_T} $$\nSubstituting the expressions for $k_T$ and $k_{VM}$ for the same $\\sigma_y$:\n$$ \\frac{\\bar{p}_{\\text{Mises}}}{\\bar{p}_{\\text{Tresca}}} = \\frac{\\sigma_y/\\sqrt{3}}{\\sigma_y/2} = \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{3}} $$\n\nThe physical origin of this discrepancy is that the von Mises and Tresca yield criteria are not identical. In principal stress space, the von Mises cylinder circumscribes the Tresca hexagonal prism. They coincide only for specific stress states like uniaxial or equi-biaxial stress. For general multi-axial stress states, such as those present in plane-strain compression, the von Mises criterion predicts a higher elastic limit. The material is effectively stronger under the von Mises assumption, as reflected by $k_{VM} \\approx 0.577\\sigma_y$ being greater than $k_T = 0.5\\sigma_y$. Consequently, a higher pressure is required to induce and sustain plastic flow throughout the strip.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\frac{2}{\\sqrt{3}}}\n$$", "id": "2685824"}]}
