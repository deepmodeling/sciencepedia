All necessary information is provided for a unique solution.\n\nThe problem requires the derivation of two quantities related to a martensitic phase transformation: the transformation deformation gradient, denoted as $F^{tr}$, and the logarithmic transformation strain tensor, denoted as $E^{tr}_{\\ln}$.\n\nFirst, we determine the transformation deformation gradient $F^{tr}$. The polar decomposition theorem states that any deformation gradient $F$ can be uniquely decomposed into a rotation tensor $R$ and a symmetric, positive-definite right stretch tensor $U$. This is expressed as:\n$$F = RU$$\nIn the context of this problem, we are considering the deformation associated with the phase transformation itself, so we apply this decomposition to the transformation deformation gradient $F^{tr}$:\n$$F^{tr} = R^{tr}U^{tr}$$\nwhere $R^{tr}$ is the rotation associated with the transformation and $U^{tr}$ is the transformation stretch tensor.\n\nThe problem statement provides two critical pieces of information. First, the transformation stretch tensor in the laboratory basis is given as:\n$$U^{tr} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1+\\epsilon_{L} & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$$\nwhere $\\epsilon_{L} > 0$. Second, it is stated that the \"transformation is assumed to occur without any rigid-body rotation relative to the laboratory frame.\" This directly implies that the rotational part of the transformation deformation gradient is the identity tensor, $I$.\n$$R^{tr} = I = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$$\nSubstituting this into the polar decomposition for $F^{tr}$, we find:\n$$F^{tr} = I U^{tr} = U^{tr}$$\nTherefore, the transformation deformation gradient is identical to the given transformation stretch tensor.\n$$F^{tr} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1+\\epsilon_{L} & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$$\n\nNext, we derive the logarithmic transformation strain tensor, $E^{tr}_{\\ln}$. The logarithmic strain, also known as Hencky strain or true strain, is defined in finite deformation theory as the matrix logarithm of the stretch tensor $U$.\n$$E_{\\ln} = \\ln(U)$$\nFor the transformation, this becomes:\n$$E^{tr}_{\\ln} = \\ln(U^{tr})$$\nTo compute the logarithm of the matrix $U^{tr}$, we utilize the fact that for a diagonalizable matrix $A = PDP^{-1}$, its logarithm is given by $\\ln(A) = P \\ln(D) P^{-1}$, where $\\ln(D)$ is the matrix whose entries are the logarithms of the diagonal entries of $D$.\nIn this specific case, the transformation stretch tensor $U^{tr}$ is already a diagonal matrix.\n$$U^{tr} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1+\\epsilon_{L} & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$$\nThe eigenvalues of $U^{tr}$ are its diagonal elements: $\\lambda_1 = 1+\\epsilon_{L}$, $\\lambda_2 = 1$, and $\\lambda_3 = 1$. The matrix logarithm $\\ln(U^{tr})$ is a diagonal matrix whose diagonal entries are the natural logarithms of the eigenvalues of $U^{tr}$.\n$$E^{tr}_{\\ln} = \\ln(U^{tr}) = \\begin{pmatrix} \\ln(1+\\epsilon_{L}) & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & \\ln(1) & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & \\ln(1) \\end{pmatrix}$$\nSince the natural logarithm of $1$ is $0$, i.e., $\\ln(1) = 0$, the logarithmic transformation strain tensor simplifies to:\n$$E^{tr}_{\\ln} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\ln(1+\\epsilon_{L}) & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$$\nThe condition $\\epsilon_L > 0$ ensures that $1+\\epsilon_L > 1$, and thus $\\ln(1+\\epsilon_L)$ is a real, positive number, which is physically consistent with an elongational strain.\n\nThe two requested quantities, $F^{tr}$ and $E^{tr}_{\\ln}$, have been derived in their matrix representations in the laboratory basis as functions of $\\epsilon_L$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\nF^{tr} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1+\\epsilon_{L} & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}, \\quad E^{tr}_{\\ln} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\ln(1+\\epsilon_{L}) & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "2661268"}, {"introduction": "Beyond kinematics, the stress-induced transformation in SMAs is governed by a delicate balance of energy.

For instance, the product of latent heat per mass ($L$) and density ($\\rho$) yields latent heat per volume, which has units of energy per volume (e.g., $\\mathrm{J/m^3}$), equivalent to pressure ($\\mathrm{Pa}$). This is consistent with the product of stress ($\\sigma^{*}$) and dimensionless strain ($\\epsilon_{L}$).\n-   **Verdict**: The problem is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and self-contained. It is therefore deemed **valid**.\n\nProceeding to the solution.\n\nThe problem requires the application of a specific energy balance principle, which dictates that the mechanical work done per unit volume, $W_{v}$, during the forward transformation is equal to the latent heat of transformation per unit volume, $L_{v}$.\n$$W_{v} = L_{v}$$\nWe first formulate the expression for the mechanical work per unit volume. For a uniaxial loading process, the incremental work per unit volume, $dW_v$, done by a stress $\\sigma$ over an infinitesimal strain increment $d\\epsilon$ is given by $dW_v = \\sigma d\\epsilon$.\nThe problem states that the transformation from austenite to martensite occurs at an approximately constant plateau stress, which we denote as $\\sigma^{*}$. The total transformation strain is $\\epsilon_{L}$. Therefore, the total mechanical work per unit volume is the integral of the stress over the transformation strain:\n$$W_{v} = \\int_{0}^{\\epsilon_{L}} \\sigma^{*} d\\epsilon$$\nSince $\\sigma^{*}$ is constant during the transformation plateau:\n$$W_{v} = \\sigma^{*} \\int_{0}^{\\epsilon_{L}} d\\epsilon = \\sigma^{*} \\epsilon_{L}$$\nNext, we formulate the expression for the latent heat per unit volume, $L_{v}$. We are given the latent heat per unit mass, $L$, and the mass density, $\\rho$. The latent heat per unit volume is the product of these two quantities:\n$$L_{v} = L \\times \\rho$$\nNow, we apply the energy balance as specified in the problem statement:\n$$\\sigma^{*} \\epsilon_{L} = L \\rho$$\nWe can solve this equation for the unknown plateau stress $\\sigma^{*}$:\n$$\\sigma^{*} = \\frac{L \\rho}{\\epsilon_{L}}$$\nWe are given the following values:\n-   $L = 20\\,\\mathrm{J/g}$\n-   $\\rho = 6.45\\,\\mathrm{g/cm^{3}}$\n-   $\\epsilon_{L} = 0.06$ (dimensionless)\n\nBefore substituting the numerical values, we must ensure unit consistency.
