The language is objective and formal. The problem does not violate any principles of physics or mathematics, is not incomplete, contradictory, or trivial. It is a standard exercise in the mechanics of phase transformations.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. A solution will be provided.\n\nThe solution proceeds as follows. We first identify the shortest nonzero translation vectors in the parent FCC lattice along the principal directions of the Bain stretch. We then determine the lengths of the corresponding vectors in the product BCT lattice. The ratio of these lengths gives the principal stretches. Finally, the determinant of the stretch tensor, which is the product of the principal stretches, is used to compute the volumetric change.\n\nLet the reference coordinate system be a Cartesian system with orthonormal basis vectors $\\{\\boldsymbol{e}_1, \\boldsymbol{e}_2, \\boldsymbol{e}_3\\}$ aligned with the cubic axes of the austenite FCC lattice: $\\boldsymbol{e}_1 \\parallel [100]_{\\gamma}$, $\\boldsymbol{e}_2 \\parallel [010]_{\\gamma}$, $\\boldsymbol{e}_3 \\parallel [001]_{\\gamma}$.\n\nIn an FCC lattice with lattice parameter $a_{\\gamma}$, the shortest nonzero translation vectors connect a corner atom to an adjacent face-center atom. These vectors are of the family $\\frac{a_{\\gamma}}{2} \\langle 110 \\rangle$.\nThe problem requires us to consider the directions $[110]_{\\gamma}$, $[\\overline{1}10]_{\\gamma}$, and $[001]_{\\gamma}$, which correspond to the principal axes of the Bain stretch tensor $\\boldsymbol{U}_{B}$.\n\n1.  For the direction $[110]_{\\gamma}$, a shortest nonzero translation vector is $\\boldsymbol{v}_1 = \\frac{a_{\\gamma}}{2}[110]_{\\gamma} = \\frac{a_{\\gamma}}{2}(\\boldsymbol{e}_1 + \\boldsymbol{e}_2)$. Its length, which is the interatomic repeat distance along this direction, is $|\\boldsymbol{v}_1| = \\sqrt{(\\frac{a_{\\gamma}}{2})^{2} + (\\frac{a_{\\gamma}}{2})^{2} + 0^{2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{2a_{\\gamma}^{2}}{4}} = \\frac{a_{\\gamma}}{\\sqrt{2}}$.\n\n2.  For the direction $[\\overline{1}10]_{\\gamma}$, a shortest nonzero translation vector is $\\boldsymbol{v}_2 = \\frac{a_{\\gamma}}{2}[\\overline{1}10]_{\\gamma} = \\frac{a_{\\gamma}}{2}(-\\boldsymbol{e}_1 + \\boldsymbol{e}_2)$. Its length is $|\\boldsymbol{v}_2| = \\sqrt{(-\\frac{a_{\\gamma}}{2})^{2} + (\\frac{a_{\\gamma}}{2})^{2} + 0^{2}} = \\frac{a_{\\gamma}}{\\sqrt{2}}$.\n\n3.  For the direction $[001]_{\\gamma}$, the shortest nonzero translation vector connects two corner atoms, for example, the one at the origin to the one at $(0, 0, a_{\\gamma})$. This vector is $\\boldsymbol{v}_3 = a_{\\gamma}[001]_{\\gamma} = a_{\\gamma}\\boldsymbol{e}_3$. Its length is $|\\boldsymbol{v}_3| = \\sqrt{0^{2} + 0^{2} + a_{\\gamma}^{2}} = a_{\\gamma}$.\n\nThe Bain correspondence maps these parent lattice directions to the principal axes of the product BCT lattice. The homogeneous deformation $\\boldsymbol{F}_{B}$ transforms the vectors $\\boldsymbol{v}_1, \\boldsymbol{v}_2, \\boldsymbol{v}_3$ into the shortest nonzero translation vectors of the BCT lattice along the corresponding directions. Let these transformed vectors be $\\boldsymbol{v}'_1, \\boldsymbol{v}'_2, \\boldsymbol{v}'_3$.\n-   $\\boldsymbol{v}_1$ along $[110]_{\\gamma}$ is mapped to $\\boldsymbol{v}'_1$ along $[100]_{\\alpha'}$. The shortest translation vector in a BCT lattice along its $[100]_{\\alpha'}$ axis has length equal to the basal lattice parameter, $a_{\\alpha'}$. Thus, $|\\boldsymbol{v}'_1| = a_{\\alpha'}$.\n-   $\\boldsymbol{v}_2$ along $[\\overline{1}10]_{\\gamma}$ is mapped to $\\boldsymbol{v}'_2$ along $[010]_{\\alpha'}$. The shortest translation vector along the $[010]_{\\alpha'}$ axis also has length $a_{\\alpha'}$. Thus, $|\\boldsymbol{v}'_2| = a_{\\alpha'}$.\n-   $\\boldsymbol{v}_3$ along $[001]_{\\gamma}$ is mapped to $\\boldsymbol{v}'_3$ along $[001]_{\\alpha'}$. The shortest translation vector along the $[001]_{\\alpha'}$ axis has length equal to the axial lattice parameter, $c_{\\alpha'}$. Thus, $|\\boldsymbol{v}'_3| = c_{\\alpha'}$.\n\nThe transformation is a pure stretch along the Bain axes, so the directions of $\\boldsymbol{v}_1, \\boldsymbol{v}_2, \\boldsymbol{v}_3$ are the principal directions of the right stretch tensor $\\boldsymbol{U}_{B}$. The corresponding principal stretches, $\\lambda_1, \\lambda_2, \\lambda_3$, are the eigenvalues of $\\boldsymbol{U}_{B}$. As stated in the problem, the stretch along any given direction is the ratio of the length of the deformed vector to the length of the original vector.\nTherefore, the principal stretches are:\n$\\lambda_1 = \\frac{|\\boldsymbol{v}'_1|}{|\\boldsymbol{v}_1|} = \\frac{a_{\\alpha'}}{a_{\\gamma}/\\sqrt{2}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{2}a_{\\alpha'}}{a_{\\gamma}}$\n$\\lambda_2 = \\frac{|\\boldsymbol{v}'_2|}{|\\boldsymbol{v}_2|} = \\frac{a_{\\alpha'}}{a_{\\gamma}/\\sqrt{2}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{2}a_{\\alpha'}}{a_{\\gamma}}$\n$\\lambda_3 = \\frac{|\\boldsymbol{v}'_3|}{|\\boldsymbol{v}_3|} = \\frac{c_{\\alpha'}}{a_{\\gamma}}$\n\nThis confirms that the principal stretches are the ratios of the BCT lattice parameters to the corresponding FCC interatomic repeat distances along the Bain axes.\n\nThe final task is to compute the volumetric change, which for a pure stretch is $\\det \\boldsymbol{U}_{B} - 1$. The determinant of a tensor is the product of its eigenvalues. In this case, the eigenvalues of $\\boldsymbol{U}_{B}$ are the principal stretches $\\lambda_1, \\lambda_2, \\lambda_3$.\nThus, the volume ratio is:\n$\\det \\boldsymbol{U}_{B} = \\lambda_1 \\lambda_2 \\lambda_3 = \\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{2}a_{\\alpha'}}{a_{\\gamma}}\\right) \\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{2}a_{\\alpha'}}{a_{\\gamma}}\\right) \\left(\\frac{c_{\\alpha'}}{a_{\\gamma}}\\right)$\n$\\det \\boldsymbol{U}_{B} = \\frac{(\\sqrt{2})^{2} (a_{\\alpha'})^{2} c_{\\alpha'}}{(a_{\\gamma})^{3}} = \\frac{2 a_{\\alpha'}^{2} c_{\\alpha'}}{a_{\\gamma}^{3}}$\n\nThe volumetric change is the volume ratio minus one.\nVolumetric Change $= \\det \\boldsymbol{U}_{B} - 1 = \\frac{2 a_{\\alpha'}^{2} c_{\\alpha'}}{a_{\\gamma}^{3}} - 1$.\nThis is the final expression required.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\frac{2 a_{\\alpha'}^{2} c_{\\alpha'}}{a_{\\gamma}^{3}} - 1}\n$$", "id": "2656868"}, {"introduction": "Having quantified the transformation stretch, we can address a crucial question in the theory of martensite: can the parent and product phases coexist along a sharp, stress-free interface known as a habit plane?

We shall proceed with a rigorous application of the principles of continuum mechanics for solid-solid phase transformations.\n\nFirst, we establish a coordinate system. Let the reference configuration be the unstressed austenite phase, a cubic crystal. We choose a Cartesian coordinate system with orthonormal basis vectors $\\{\\mathbf{e}_1, \\mathbf{e}_2, \\mathbf{e}_3\\}$ aligned with the crystallographic axes of the cubic cell. The primitive lattice vectors of the austenite phase can be written as:\n$$ \\mathbf{p}_1 = a_0 \\mathbf{e}_1, \\quad \\mathbf{p}_2 = a_0 \\mathbf{e}_2, \\quad \\mathbf{p}_3 = a_0 \\mathbf{e}_3 $$\nwhere $a_0$ is the lattice parameter of the austenite, given as $a_0 = 3.000\\,\\text{\\AA}$.\n\nThe transformation maps the austenite crystal to a martensite variant. The problem states that the resulting martensite is orthorhombic, and its crystallographic basis vectors are parallel to the austenite basis vectors. The lattice vectors of this martensite variant are therefore:\n$$ \\mathbf{q}_1 = a_m \\mathbf{e}_1, \\quad \\mathbf{q}_2 = b_m \\mathbf{e}_2, \\quad \\mathbf{q}_3 = c_m \\mathbf{e}_3 $$\nwhere the lattice parameters of the martensite are given as $a_m = 2.955\\,\\text{\\AA}$, $b_m = 3.045\\,\\text{\\AA}$, and $c_m = 3.000\\,\\text{\\AA}$.\n\nThe deformation gradient tensor, denoted by $F$, describes the linear transformation that maps the reference lattice vectors $\\mathbf{p}_i$ to the deformed lattice vectors $\\mathbf{q}_i$. It is defined by the relation $\\mathbf{q}_i = F \\mathbf{p}_i$. Expressing this in matrix form with respect to the basis $\\{\\mathbf{e}_1, \\mathbf{e}_2, \\mathbf{e}_3\\}$:\n$$ F \\begin{pmatrix} a_0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & a_0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & a_0 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} a_m & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & b_m & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & c_m \\end{pmatrix} $$\nSolving for $F$, we find:\n$$ F = \\begin{pmatrix} a_m & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & b_m & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & c_m \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{1}{a_0} & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & \\frac{1}{a_0} & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & \\frac{1}{a_0} \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{a_m}{a_0} & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & \\frac{b_m}{a_0} & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & \\frac{c_m}{a_0} \\end{pmatrix} $$\nThese diagonal entries are the principal stretches of the transformation, which we denote as $\\eta_1 = \\frac{a_m}{a_0}$, $\\eta_2 = \\frac{b_m}{a_0}$, and $\\eta_3 = \\frac{c_m}{a_0}$. Thus, $F$ is a diagonal matrix:\n$$ F = \\text{diag}(\\eta_1, \\eta_2, \\eta_3) $$\n\nThe next step is to construct the right stretch tensor $U$. The polar decomposition theorem states that any invertible deformation gradient $F$ can be uniquely decomposed into a rotation $R$ and a symmetric positive-definite right stretch tensor $U$ such that $F = RU$. The stretch tensor is given by $U = \\sqrt{F^T F}$.\nWe first compute the right Cauchy-Green deformation tensor, $C = F^T F$:\n$$ C = F^T F = \\begin{pmatrix} \\eta_1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & \\eta_2 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & \\eta_3 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} \\eta_1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & \\eta_2 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & \\eta_3 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\eta_1^2 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & \\eta_2^2 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & \\eta_3^2 \\end{pmatrix} $$\nThe right stretch tensor $U$ is the unique positive-definite square root of $C$. For a diagonal matrix $C$ with positive entries, its square root is simply the diagonal matrix of the square roots of the entries:\n$$ U = \\sqrt{C} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\sqrt{\\eta_1^2} & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & \\sqrt{\\eta_2^2} & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & \\sqrt{\\eta_3^2} \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\eta_1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & \\eta_2 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & \\eta_3 \\end{pmatrix} $$\nWe have used the fact that the lattice parameters are positive, so $\\eta_i > 0$. In this special case where the crystallographic axes are aligned, the deformation gradient $F$ is already symmetric and positive-definite, meaning it is a pure stretch tensor, so $U = F$ and the rotation part is the identity, $R=I$.\n\nThe eigenvalues of the stretch tensor $U$, denoted $\\lambda_i$, are the roots of the characteristic equation $\\det(U - \\lambda I) = 0$. For a diagonal matrix such as $U$, the eigenvalues are simply the diagonal entries.\nTherefore, the eigenvalues of $U$ are $\\{\\eta_1, \\eta_2, \\eta_3\\}$. We now compute their numerical values:\n$$ \\eta_1 = \\frac{a_m}{a_0} = \\frac{2.955}{3.000} = 0.985 $$\n$$ \\eta_2 = \\frac{b_m}{a_0} = \\frac{3.045}{3.000} = 1.015 $$\n$$ \\eta_3 = \\frac{c_m}{a_0} = \\frac{3.000}{3.000} = 1.000 $$\n\nThe problem requires ordering these eigenvalues as $0 < \\lambda_1 \\le \\lambda_2 \\le \\lambda_3$. Arranging the computed values accordingly:\n$$ \\lambda_1 = 0.985 $$\n$$ \\lambda_2 = 1.000 $$\n$$ \\lambda_3 = 1.015 $$\nThe middle eigenvalue is therefore $\\lambda_2 = 1.000$.\n\nFinally, we must assess whether a compatible, stress-free habit plane can exist between the austenite and this single martensite variant. This is known as a rank-one connection between the identity tensor $I$ (representing austenite) and the transformation stretch tensor $U$ (representing the martensite variant). The crystallographic theory of martensite, particularly the work of Ball and James, provides a necessary and sufficient condition for such a connection to exist. The condition states that an interface is possible if and only if the middle eigenvalue of the transformation stretch tensor $U$ is exactly equal to one.\nThat is, a compatible interface exists if and only if:\n$$ \\lambda_2 = 1 $$\nIn our case, we have found that $\\lambda_2 = 1.000$. This condition is satisfied exactly. Therefore, we conclude that an exact austenite-martensite rank-one connection can exist for this variant, which physically implies the possibility of forming a stress-free, coherent interface (habit plane) between the parent austenite and the product martensite.\n\nThe problem asks for the numerical value of the middle eigenvalue $\\lambda_2$, rounded to six significant figures.
