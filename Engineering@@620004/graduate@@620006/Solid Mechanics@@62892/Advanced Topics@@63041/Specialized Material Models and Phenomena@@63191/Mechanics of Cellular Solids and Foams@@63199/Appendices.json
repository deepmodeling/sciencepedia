The network is random but statistically isotropic, and in the small-strain limit its macroscopic deformation under simple shear is dominated by bending of the cell edges (struts). Assume slenderness $r \\ll l$ so that Euler–Bernoulli beam theory is applicable to strut bending.

It represents a standard problem in the mechanics of cellular solids. We may proceed with a solution.\n\nThe derivation is based on an energy balance principle, where the macroscopic strain energy density stored in a representative volume of the foam is equated to the summation of the strain energy stored in the individual struts within that volume.\n\nLet the foam be subjected to a macroscopic simple shear strain $\\gamma$. The macroscopic elastic strain energy density, $U$, is given by:\n$$U = \\frac{1}{2} G \\gamma^2$$\nwhere $G$ is the macroscopic shear modulus of the foam.\n\nThis macroscopic energy is stored at the microscopic level through the deformation of the constituent struts. The problem states that the dominant deformation mechanism is bending. A macroscopic strain $\\gamma$ induces lateral deflections, $\\delta$, at the ends of the struts. For a strut of length $l$, this deflection scales linearly with the strain and the strut length:\n$$\\delta \\propto \\gamma l$$\nThis deflection causes the strut to bend. According to Euler–Bernoulli beam theory, the curvature, $\\kappa$, of a slender beam is related to its transverse deflection. For a characteristic deflection $\\delta$ over a length $l$, the curvature scales as:\n$$\\kappa \\propto \\frac{\\delta}{l^2}$$\nSubstituting the scaling for $\\delta$, we obtain the first required intermediate scaling for the strut curvature:\n$$\\kappa \\propto \\frac{\\gamma l}{l^2} = \\frac{\\gamma}{l}$$\nThe bending strain energy, $U_{strut}$, stored in a single elastic strut is given by:\n$$U_{strut} = \\frac{1}{2} \\int_{0}^{l} E_s I_s \\kappa(x)^2 dx$$\nwhere $E_s$ is the Young's modulus of the solid material from which the foam is made, and $I_s$ is the second moment of area of the strut's cross-section. Assuming an average curvature $\\kappa$ along the length $l$, the strain energy per strut scales as:\n$$U_{strut} \\propto E_s I_s \\kappa^2 l$$\nThis is the second required intermediate scaling. Substituting the scaling relation for $\\kappa$:\n$$U_{strut} \\propto E_s I_s \\left(\\frac{\\gamma}{l}\\right)^2 l = \\frac{E_s I_s \\gamma^2}{l}$$\nThe total strain energy per unit volume of the foam, $U_{total}$, is the product of the energy per strut and the number of struts per unit volume, $n_e$. Any orientational averaging effects are absorbed into the dimensionless constants as per the problem statement.\n$$U_{total} = n_e U_{strut} \\propto n_e \\frac{E_s I_s \\gamma^2}{l}$$\nEquating the macroscopic and microscopic energy densities, $U = U_{total}$:\n$$\\frac{1}{2} G \\gamma^2 \\propto n_e \\frac{E_s I_s \\gamma^2}{l}$$\nSolving for the macroscopic shear modulus $G$ yields:\n$$G \\propto \\frac{n_e E_s I_s}{l}$$\nNow, we introduce the geometric parameters provided. The number density of struts is $n_e = C_n/l^3$. The strut has a circular cross-section of radius $r$, for which the second moment of area is $I_s = \\frac{\\pi r^4}{4}$. Therefore, $I_s \\propto r^4$. Substituting these into the expression for $G$:\n$$G \\propto \\left(\\frac{C_n}{l^3}\\right) E_s \\frac{r^4}{l} = C_n E_s \\left(\\frac{r}{l}\\right)^4$$\nThe final step is to express this scaling in terms of the foam's relative density, $\\bar{\\rho}$. We are given $\\bar{\\rho} = C_{\\rho}(A/l^2)$, where $A=\\pi r^2$. This gives:\n$$\\bar{\\rho} = C_{\\rho} \\pi \\left(\\frac{r}{l}\\right)^2$$\nThis implies that $(r/l)^2 \\propto \\bar{\\rho}$, and consequently, $(r/l)^4 \\propto \\bar{\\rho}^2$.\nSubstituting this into our expression for $G$:\n$$G \\propto E_s \\bar{\\rho}^2$$\nThe problem requests the scaling in the form $G/G_s$. Using the relationship for an isotropic elastic solid, $E_s = 2G_s(1+\\nu_s)$:\n$$G \\propto 2G_s(1+\\nu_s)\\bar{\\rho}^2$$\nDividing by $G_s$, we get the final scaling form:\n$$\\frac{G}{G_s} \\propto (1+\\nu_s)\\bar{\\rho}^2$$\nComparing this to the specified form $G/G_s \\sim \\alpha \\bar{\\rho}^n$, we can identify the exponent $n=2$. The prefactor $\\alpha$ is a dimensionless constant that depends on $C_n$, $C_\\rho$, and $\\nu_s$.\n\nNext, we must compare this exponent to the one governing the scaling of the macroscopic Young's modulus, $E$. The analysis for $E$ under a macroscopic uniaxial strain $\\varepsilon$ is analogous. The macroscopic strain energy density is $U_E = \\frac{1}{2}E\\varepsilon^2$. The deformation mechanism is still strut bending. The strut end deflections are now driven by the strain $\\varepsilon$, so $\\delta \\propto \\varepsilon l$. The subsequent steps are identical, with $\\varepsilon$ replacing $\\gamma$.\nThe strut curvature scales as $\\kappa \\propto \\varepsilon/l$. The strut bending energy scales as $U_{strut} \\propto E_s I_s \\varepsilon^2/l$. The total energy density is $U_{total} \\propto n_e E_s I_s \\varepsilon^2/l$.\nEquating $\\frac{1}{2}E\\varepsilon^2$ with $U_{total}$ yields:\n$$E \\propto \\frac{n_e E_s I_s}{l}$$\nThis is the same proportionality as derived for $G$. Therefore, the entire subsequent derivation holds, leading to:\n$$E \\propto E_s \\left(\\frac{r}{l}\\right)^4 \\propto E_s \\bar{\\rho}^2$$\nThe scaling exponent for the Young's modulus $E$ is also $n=2$.\nThus, the exponent $n$ for the shear modulus $G$ is equal to the corresponding exponent for the Young's modulus $E$. The fundamental reason for this equality is the shared, dominant deformation mechanism of strut bending, as stipulated in the problem. For any loading condition (shear, tension, compression) where strut bending dominates the foam's elastic response, the macroscopic modulus will scale with the geometric factor $(r/l)^4$, which in turn corresponds to a scaling with the square of the relative density, $\\bar{\\rho}^2$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{2}$$", "id": "2660447"}, {"introduction": "The mechanical properties of cellular solids are exquisitely sensitive to their internal architecture.

It is well-posed, objective, and internally consistent. The assumptions, such as idealized pin joints and slender struts, are standard simplifications in the theoretical analysis of lattice structures. The problem provides all necessary information to perform the requested derivations. There are no contradictions, ambiguities, or factual unsoundness.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict**\nThe problem is valid. A solution will be provided.\n\nThe problem requires a modification to a baseline bending-dominated architecture to make it stretch-dominated. The baseline architecture is a simple cubic lattice of side length $L$ with pin-jointed struts along its $12$ edges. Such a structure is a mechanism; under load, the square faces shear, forcing the struts to bend. This is the origin of its bending-dominated behavior.\n\nTo convert this to a stretch-dominated architecture, the unit cell must be triangulated to create a statically determinate truss. A simple and effective modification is to add bracing members. For a $3$D pin-jointed frame with $j$ joints, stability (static determinacy) requires $b = 3j - 6$ struts, according to Maxwell's criterion. The cubic cell has $j=8$ joints, thus requiring $b = 3(8) - 6 = 18$ struts. The initial cell has $12$ struts. We must add $18 - 12 = 6$ struts. This can be achieved by adding one diagonal strut to each of the $6$ faces of the cube. These added struts have length $\\sqrt{2}L$, which is on the same nominal length scale $L$. The resulting structure is a rigid frame where loads are carried by axial forces in the members.\n\nWe must verify that the relative density scaling is preserved. The relative density $\\bar{\\rho}$ is the ratio of the volume of solid material to the total volume of the unit cell, $\\bar{\\rho} = V_{\\text{solid}}/V_{\\text{cell}}$.\nThe volume of the cell is $V_{\\text{cell}} = L^3$.\nAssuming all struts have the same cross-sectional area $A \\sim t^2$, the solid volume in the modified cell is the sum of the volume of the original $12$ edge struts and the $6$ new face-diagonal struts:\n$$V_{\\text{solid}} = 12 \\cdot (A \\cdot L) + 6 \\cdot (A \\cdot \\sqrt{2}L) = (12+6\\sqrt{2}) A L$$\nThe relative density is therefore:\n$$\\bar{\\rho} = \\frac{(12+6\\sqrt{2}) A L}{L^3} \\sim \\frac{(12+6\\sqrt{2}) t^2 L}{L^3} = (12+6\\sqrt{2}) \\left(\\frac{t}{L}\\right)^2$$\nThus, the relative density scales as $\\bar{\\rho} \\sim (t/L)^2$. The geometric pre-factor has changed from the baseline case, but the power-law dependence is the same. This confirms the validity of the assumption and provides the crucial relationship for the derivations:\n$$\\frac{t}{L} \\sim \\bar{\\rho}^{\\,1/2}$$\n\nNow, we derive the scaling exponents for both architectures. The macroscopic Young's modulus is $E^* = \\sigma^*/\\epsilon$ and the macroscopic yield strength is $\\sigma^*_y$.\n\n**Baseline Bending-Dominated Architecture**\n\n1.  **Effective Modulus, $E^*$**:\n    The macroscopic stress and strain are related to the force $F$ and displacement $\\delta$ at the unit cell level by $\\sigma^* \\sim F/L^2$ and $\\epsilon \\sim \\delta/L$. This gives $E^* = \\sigma^*/\\epsilon \\sim F/(L\\delta)$. The overall stiffness of the cell is $K_{cell} = F/\\delta$, so $E^* \\sim K_{cell}/L$.\n    For a bending-dominated structure, the cell's stiffness is governed by the bending stiffness of its constituent struts. The stiffness of a single strut against a transverse load is $k_{bend} \\sim E_s I / L^3$. The cell stiffness is of the same order, $K_{cell} \\sim k_{bend}$.\n    Therefore, $E^* \\sim \\frac{k_{bend}}{L} \\sim \\frac{E_s I / L^3}{L} = \\frac{E_s I}{L^4}$.\n    With the second moment of area $I \\sim t^4$, we obtain:\n    $$E^* \\sim E_s \\frac{t^4}{L^4} = E_s \\left(\\frac{t}{L}\\right)^4$$\n    Substituting $(t/L) \\sim \\bar{\\rho}^{\\,1/2}$:\n    $$\\frac{E^*}{E_s} \\sim \\left(\\bar{\\rho}^{\\,1/2}\\right)^4 = \\bar{\\rho}^{\\,2}$$\n    Thus, for the bending-dominated case, the exponent is $n_E = 2$.\n\n2.  **Effective Yield Strength, $\\sigma^*_y$**:\n    Failure occurs when the struts yield plastically. In this case, yielding is initiated by the formation of plastic hinges when the bending moment in a strut reaches the yield moment, $M_y \\sim \\sigma_{ys} t^3$. The moment in a strut is related to the transverse force $F_{strut}$ on it by $M \\sim F_{strut}L$. At yield, the force is $F_{strut,y} \\sim M_y/L \\sim \\sigma_{ys}t^3/L$. The macroscopic force on the cell face is of the same order, $F \\sim F_{strut,y}$.\n    The macroscopic yield stress is then:\n    $$\\sigma^*_y \\sim \\frac{F}{L^2} \\sim \\frac{\\sigma_{ys}t^3/L}{L^2} = \\sigma_{ys} \\left(\\frac{t}{L}\\right)^3$$\n    Substituting $(t/L) \\sim \\bar{\\rho}^{\\,1/2}$:\n    $$\\frac{\\sigma^*_y}{\\sigma_{ys}} \\sim \\left(\\bar{\\rho}^{\\,1/2}\\right)^3 = \\bar{\\rho}^{\\,3/2}$$\n    Thus, for the bending-dominated case, the exponent is $n_\\sigma = 3/2$.\n\n**Modified Stretch-Dominated Architecture**\n\n1.  **Effective Modulus, $E^*_{new}$**:\n    In the triangulated, stretch-dominated structure, deformation occurs through axial stretching and compression of the struts. The axial strain in a typical strut, $\\epsilon_{strut}$, is proportional to the macroscopic strain, $\\epsilon_{strut} \\sim \\epsilon$.\n    The axial force in a strut is $F_{strut} = \\epsilon_{strut} \\cdot (E_s A)$. From a force balance at a node, the macroscopic stress $\\sigma^*$ is proportional to the stress in the struts, $\\sigma^* \\sim F_{strut}/L^2$.\n    $$\\sigma^* \\sim \\frac{\\epsilon_{strut} E_s A}{L^2} \\sim \\frac{\\epsilon E_s A}{L^2}$$\n    The effective modulus is $E^*_{new} = \\sigma^*/\\epsilon$:\n    $$E^*_{new} \\sim \\frac{\\epsilon E_s A / L^2}{\\epsilon} = E_s \\frac{A}{L^2}$$\n    With the cross-sectional area $A \\sim t^2$:\n    $$E^*_{new} \\sim E_s \\left(\\frac{t}{L}\\right)^2$$\n    Substituting $(t/L)^2 \\sim \\bar{\\rho}$:\n    $$\\frac{E^*_{new}}{E_s} \\sim \\bar{\\rho}$$\n    Thus, for the new stretch-dominated architecture, the exponent is $n_{E}^{\\text{new}} = 1$.\n\n2.  **Effective Yield Strength, $\\sigma^*_{y,new}$**:\n    Failure occurs when the axial force in a strut reaches the axial yield force, $F_{y,axial} \\sim \\sigma_{ys} A$.\n    The macroscopic yield stress $\\sigma^*_{y,new}$ corresponds to the macroscopic stress when this occurs. From force balance, $\\sigma^*_{y,new} \\sim F_{y,axial}/L^2$.\n    $$\\sigma^*_{y,new} \\sim \\frac{\\sigma_{ys} A}{L^2}$$\n    With $A \\sim t^2$:\n    $$\\sigma^*_{y,new} \\sim \\sigma_{ys} \\left(\\frac{t}{L}\\right)^2$$\n    Substituting $(t/L)^2 \\sim \\bar{\\rho}$:\n    $$\\frac{\\sigma^*_{y,new}}{\\sigma_{ys}} \\sim \\bar{\\rho}$$\n    Thus, for the new stretch-dominated architecture, the exponent is $n_{\\sigma}^{\\text{new}} = 1$.\n\nThe requested exponents for the modified stretch-dominated architecture are $[n_{E}^{\\text{new}}, n_{\\sigma}^{\\text{new}}]$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n1 & 1\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "2660484"}, {"introduction": "Beyond the elastic regime, the behavior of foams under large compressive strains—their plastic collapse—is critical for applications like cushioning and energy absorption.

We integrate this differential equation, with the initial condition that plastic strain is zero at the onset of yielding, which we take to be at $\\epsilon = 0$.\n$$\n\\int_{0}^{\\bar{\\epsilon}_{p}} d\\bar{\\epsilon}_{p}' = \\int_{0}^{\\epsilon} \\beta\\, d\\epsilon'\n$$\nAs $\\beta$ is a constant, the integration gives:\n$$\n\\bar{\\epsilon}_{p} = \\beta\\,\\epsilon\n$$\nSubstituting this into the expression for $\\sigma$, we arrive at the final form for the macroscopic stress as a function of macroscopic strain:\n$$\n\\sigma(\\epsilon) = C\\,\\phi^{3/2}\\,(\\sigma_{y} + H \\beta \\epsilon)\n$$\nThis expression shows that the classic constant-stress plateau, $\\sigma_{plateau} = C\\,\\phi^{3/2}\\,\\sigma_{y}$, is modified by an additional term, $C H \\beta \\phi^{3/2}\\,\\epsilon$, that increases linearly with strain due to material hardening.\n\nThe second task is to determine the initial post-yield tangent slope, $S$, defined as $S \\equiv \\left.\\frac{d\\sigma}{d\\epsilon}\\right|_{\\epsilon \\to 0^{+}}$. We differentiate the derived expression for $\\sigma(\\epsilon)$ with respect to $\\epsilon$:\n$$\n\\frac{d\\sigma}{d\\epsilon} = \\frac{d}{d\\epsilon} \\left[ C\\,\\phi^{3/2}\\,(\\sigma_{y} + H \\beta \\epsilon) \\right] = \\frac{d}{d\\epsilon} \\left[ C\\,\\phi^{3/2}\\,\\sigma_{y} + C H \\beta \\phi^{3/2}\\,\\epsilon \\right]\n$$\nThe term $C\\,\\phi^{3/2}\\,\\sigma_{y}$ is the initial collapse stress and is constant. The derivative is therefore:\n$$\n\\frac{d\\sigma}{d\\epsilon} = C H \\beta \\phi^{3/2}\n$$\nSince this derivative is a constant, its value in the limit $\\epsilon \\to 0^{+}$ is the same. Thus, the initial tangent slope is:\n$$\nS = C H \\beta \\phi^{3/2}\n$$\nThis completes the derivation. The two required expressions have been found in terms of the specified variables.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} C\\,\\phi^{3/2}(\\sigma_{y} + H \\beta \\epsilon) & C H \\beta \\phi^{3/2} \\end{pmatrix}}$$", "id": "2660522"}]}
