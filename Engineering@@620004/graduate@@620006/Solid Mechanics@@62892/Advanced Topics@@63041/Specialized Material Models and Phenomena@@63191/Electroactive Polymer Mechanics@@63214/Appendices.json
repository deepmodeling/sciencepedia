It is well-posed, as the provided information is sufficient and consistent for deriving the requested relationship. The language is objective and precise.

The problem is a straightforward application of these definitions and does not contain any scientific flaws, inconsistencies, or ambiguities. It is a valid problem.\n\nStep 3: Verdict and Action.\nThe problem is deemed valid. A solution will now be derived.\n\nThe deformation of the material is described by the deformation gradient tensor $\\mathbf{F}$. For a homogeneous deformation where the principal axes of stretch are aligned with a Cartesian coordinate system $(x_1, x_2, x_3)$, the deformation gradient tensor can be represented by a diagonal matrix whose components are the principal stretches:\n$$\n\\mathbf{F} = \\begin{pmatrix}\n\\lambda_1 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n0 & \\lambda_2 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & \\lambda_3\n\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nHere, $\\lambda_1$ and $\\lambda_2$ are the principal stretches in the plane of the membrane, and $\\lambda_3$ is the principal stretch in the thickness direction, normal to the plane.\n\nThe problem specifies an equi-biaxial deformation, which means the in-plane stretches are equal. Let this common stretch be $\\lambda$. Thus, we have:\n$$\n\\lambda_1 = \\lambda\n$$\n$$\n\\lambda_2 = \\lambda\n$$\nSubstituting these into the matrix representation of $\\mathbf{F}$ yields:\n$$\n\\mathbf{F} = \\begin{pmatrix}\n\\lambda & 0 & 0 \\\\\n0 & \\lambda & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & \\lambda_3\n\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe problem states that the material is strictly incompressible. In continuum mechanics, the incompressibility constraint is mathematically expressed by the condition that the local volume ratio, $J$, must be equal to $1$ everywhere and for all time. The local volume ratio is defined as the determinant of the deformation gradient tensor:\n$$\nJ = \\det(\\mathbf{F}) = 1\n$$\nWe now compute the determinant of the specific deformation gradient for this problem:\n$$\n\\det(\\mathbf{F}) = (\\lambda)(\\lambda)(\\lambda_3) = \\lambda^{2} \\lambda_3\n$$\nApplying the incompressibility constraint, we set this expression for the determinant equal to $1$:\n$$\n\\lambda^{2} \\lambda_3 = 1\n$$\nThis equation is the direct relationship connecting the in-plane area stretch, which is $(\\lambda \\times \\lambda) = \\lambda^2$, and the thickness stretch $\\lambda_3$. This fulfills the first part of the problem's request.\n\nTo fulfill the second part, we must express the thickness stretch $\\lambda_3$ explicitly as a function of the in-plane principal stretch $\\lambda$. This requires a simple algebraic rearrangement of the derived relationship.

The potential is $-S_p \\lambda_1 - S_p \\lambda_2 = -2S_p\\lambda$.\n\nThe total potential energy density is:\n$$ W_{\\mathrm{tot}}(\\lambda; \\tilde{E}, \\lambda_p) = \\mu\\lambda^2 + \\frac{\\mu}{2}\\lambda^{-4} - 2\\mu(\\lambda_p - \\lambda_p^{-5})\\lambda - \\frac{1}{2}\\epsilon\\tilde{E}^2\\lambda^4 + \\text{const.} $$\n\n**Equilibrium and Stability**\n- **Equilibrium:** The equilibrium stretch $ \\lambda $ is found by minimizing $ W_{\\mathrm{tot}} $ with respect to $ \\lambda $: $ \\partial W_{\\mathrm{tot}}/\\partial\\lambda = 0 $.\n    $$ \\frac{\\partial W_{\\mathrm{tot}}}{\\partial\\lambda} = 2\\mu\\lambda - 2\\mu\\lambda^{-5} - 2\\mu(\\lambda_p - \\lambda_p^{-5}) - 2\\epsilon\\tilde{E}^2\\lambda^3 = 0 $$\n    $$ \\mu(\\lambda - \\lambda^{-5}) - \\mu(\\lambda_p - \\lambda_p^{-5}) = \\epsilon\\tilde{E}^2\\lambda^3 \\quad (\\text{Eq. 1})$$\n    This equation states that the change in mechanical stress due to actuation is balanced by the Maxwell stress.\n\n- **Stability:** Electromechanical instability (pull-in) occurs when the potential energy landscape loses its convexity, i.e., $ \\partial^2W_{\\mathrm{tot}}/\\partial\\lambda^2 = 0 $.\n    $$ \\frac{\\partial^2 W_{\\mathrm{tot}}}{\\partial\\lambda^2} = 2\\mu + 10\\mu\\lambda^{-6} - 6\\epsilon\\tilde{E}^2\\lambda^2 = 0 \\quad (\\text{Eq. 2}) $$\n\nAt the onset of pull-in instability (at stretch $ \\lambda_{PI} $ and field $ \\tilde{E}_{PI} $), both equations must hold. We can eliminate $ \\tilde{E}_{PI} $ to relate $ \\lambda_{PI} $ to $ \\lambda_p $. From Eq. 2:\n$$ \\epsilon\\tilde{E}_{PI}^2 = \\frac{\\mu(1 + 5\\lambda_{PI}^{-6})}{3\\lambda_{PI}^2} $$\nSubstituting this into Eq. 1:\n$$ \\mu(\\lambda_{PI} - \\lambda_{PI}^{-5}) - \\mu(\\lambda_p - \\lambda_p^{-5}) = \\left(\\frac{\\mu(1 + 5\\lambda_{PI}^{-6})}{3\\lambda_{PI}^2}\\right)\\lambda_{PI}^3 $$\nThe shear modulus $ \\mu $ cancels. Simplifying yields the relationship between the pull-in stretch and the pre-stretch:\n$$ \\frac{2}{3}\\lambda_{PI} - \\frac{8}{3}\\lambda_{PI}^{-5} = \\lambda_p - \\lambda_p^{-5} \\quad (\\text{Eq. 3}) $$\nThis shows that increasing $ \\lambda_p $ increases $ \\lambda_{PI} $, meaning pre-stretch mechanically stiffens the membrane and delays pull-in instability.\n\n**Optimization for Maximum Actuation Strain**\nFailure occurs by either pull-in instability or dielectric breakdown.\n- **Dielectric Breakdown:** The current electric field is $ E = \\Phi/h = (\\Phi/H_0)(H_0/h) = \\tilde{E}\\lambda^2 $. The breakdown condition is $ E \\ge E_{\\mathrm{bd}} $, or:\n    $$ \\tilde{E}\\lambda^2 \\ge E_{\\mathrm{bd}} $$\nThe greatest actuation performance is achieved when the system can be driven to the highest possible stretch before failure. This occurs when the two failure modes, pull-in and breakdown, happen simultaneously. Let this optimal point be denoted by ($ \\lambda^*, \\tilde{E}^* $). At this point:\n1.  The stability condition holds: $ \\epsilon(\\tilde{E}^*)^2 = \\frac{\\mu(1 + 5(\\lambda^*)^{-6})}{3(\\lambda^*)^2} $.\n2.  The breakdown condition is met exactly: $ \\tilde{E}^* = E_{\\mathrm{bd}}/(\\lambda^*)^2 $.\n\nEquating the expressions for $ (\\tilde{E}^*)^2 $:\n$$ \\frac{E_{\\mathrm{bd}}^2}{(\\lambda^*)^4} = \\frac{\\mu(1 + 5(\\lambda^*)^{-6})}{3\\epsilon(\\lambda^*)^2} $$\n$$ \\mu((\\lambda^*)^2 + 5(\\lambda^*)^{-4}) = 3\\epsilon E_{\\mathrm{bd}}^2 $$\nLet $ x = (\\lambda^*)^2 $. The equation for the optimal squared stretch $ x $ is:\n$$ \\mu x + 5\\mu x^{-2} = 3\\epsilon E_{\\mathrm{bd}}^2 \\implies x^3 - \\left(\\frac{3\\epsilon E_{\\mathrm{bd}}^2}{\\mu}\\right)x^2 + 5 = 0 $$\n\n**Numerical Calculation**\nFirst, we compute the coefficient using the given material parameters:\n$ \\epsilon = \\epsilon_r\\epsilon_0 = 4 \\times (8.854 \\times 10^{-12}\\,\\mathrm{F/m}) = 3.5416 \\times 10^{-11}\\,\\mathrm{F/m} $\n$$ \\frac{3\\epsilon E_{\\mathrm{bd}}^2}{\\mu} = \\frac{3 \\times (3.5416 \\times 10^{-11}) \\times (100 \\times 10^6)^2}{0.2 \\times 10^6} = \\frac{1.06248 \\times 10^6}{0.2 \\times 10^6} \\approx 5.3124 $$\nThe cubic equation for $ x = (\\lambda^*)^2 $ is:\n$$ x^3 - 5.3124 x^2 + 5 = 0 $$\nSolving this numerically for $ x > 1 $ yields $ x \\approx 5.121 $.\nThis gives the maximum achievable stretch squared. The stretch itself is $ \\lambda^* = \\sqrt{x} \\approx \\sqrt{5.121} \\approx 2.263 $.\n\nNow, we find the optimal pre-stretch $ \\lambda_p $ that allows the system to reach this state. We use Eq. 3 with $ \\lambda_{PI} = \\lambda^* $:\n$$ \\lambda_p - \\lambda_p^{-5} = \\frac{2}{3}\\lambda^* - \\frac{8}{3}(\\lambda^*)^{-5} $$\nSubstituting $ \\lambda^* \\approx 2.263 $:\n$$ \\text{RHS} = \\frac{2}{3}(2.263) - \\frac{8}{3}(2.263)^{-5} \\approx 1.5087 - 2.6667 \\times (0.01684) \\approx 1.5087 - 0.0449 \\approx 1.4638 $$\nWe must now solve $ \\lambda_p - \\lambda_p^{-5} = 1.4638 $.\nSince $ \\lambda_p^{-5} $ is a small positive term, $ \\lambda_p $ will be slightly larger than $1.4638$.\n- For $ \\lambda_p = 1.5 $: $ 1.5 - 1.5^{-5} \\approx 1.368 $.\n- For $ \\lambda_p = 1.6 $: $ 1.6 - 1.6^{-5} \\approx 1.505 $.\n- For $ \\lambda_p = 1.57 $: $ 1.57 - 1.57^{-5} \\approx 1.464 $.\nThe calculation yields an optimal pre-stretch $ \\lambda_p \\approx 1.57 $.\n\n### Step 3: Evaluation of Options\n\n**A. Pre-stretch only deepens the mechanical energy well and monotonically delays instability without any trade-off; therefore, the areal strain at failure is maximized by taking $ \\lambda_p $ as large as possible.**\n**Incorrect.** This statement misses the critical trade-off. While pre-stretch increases mechanical stiffness and delays *pull-in* instability, it also thins the membrane. For a given applied voltage, a thinner membrane experiences a higher electric field ($E=\\Phi/h$), leading to larger Maxwell stresses and a lower threshold for *dielectric breakdown*. This competition creates an optimum, invalidating the claim that $ \\lambda_p $ should be as large as possible.\n\n**B. Pre-stretch increases mechanical stiffness (raising the energy curvature) while thinning the film, which amplifies Maxwell energy under voltage control; this creates a non-monotonic stability limit. The areal strain at failure is maximized when the pull-in field equals the material breakdown field in the current configuration, yielding an optimal equal-biaxial pre-stretch $ \\lambda_p \\approx 1.6 $ for the given parameters.**\n**Correct.** The physical explanation is accurate. Pre-stretch provides mechanical stiffening (stabilizing) but also enhances the electrical load for a given voltage (destabilizing with respect to breakdown), creating a trade-off. The optimization principle stated—equating the pull-in instability condition with the dielectric breakdown condition—is the correct method to find the pre-stretch that allows for the maximum possible actuation stretch. My rigorous calculation gives $ \\lambda_p \\approx 1.57 $, which is very close to the stated $ 1.6 $. The minor discrepancy is likely due to rounding in the option's value or minor variations in model assumptions not detailed in the problem. Among the given choices, this option provides the correct physical reasoning and methodology.\n\n**C. Pre-stretch destabilizes the actuator because it reduces thickness, so the optimal strategy is zero pre-stretch, $ \\lambda_p = 1 $, for maximizing areal strain.**\n**Incorrect.** Pre-stretch, by stiffening the membrane, *stabilizes* it against pull-in instability, allowing it to withstand higher electric fields before snapping. The claim that it is purely destabilizing is false. Zero pre-stretch is generally not optimal, as a small amount of pre-stretch prevents premature pull-in and allows for much larger actuation strains.\n\n**D. The optimal pre-stretch is geometric and universal, independent of $ \\mu $, $ \\epsilon $, or $ E_{\\mathrm{bd}} $, and equals $ \\sqrt{2} $ for any DEA.**\n**Incorrect.** The optimal condition involves a balance between mechanical forces (governed by $ \\mu $) and electrical forces (governed by $ \\epsilon $ and limited by $ E_{\\mathrm{bd}} $). As shown in the derivation, the optimal stretch $ \\lambda^* $ is a function of the parameter group $ \\epsilon E_{\\mathrm{bd}}^2 / \\mu $. The optimal pre-stretch $ \\lambda_p $ in turn depends on $ \\lambda^* $. Therefore, the optimal pre-stretch is material-dependent, not a universal geometric constant.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2635384"}]}
