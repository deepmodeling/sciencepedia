It is a standard problem in continuum mechanics that is scientifically sound, well-posed, and objective. A solution will be provided.\n\nThe solution proceeds in three parts as requested.\n\nPart 1: Derivation of the cubic elasticity tensor $\\mathbb{C}$\nWe begin with the most general elasticity tensor $\\mathbb{C}$ possessing only the inherent minor and major symmetries, which has $21$ independent components. We then impose the constraints required by cubic symmetry. The cubic symmetry group includes, among others, rotations by $\\pi$ about the coordinate axes ($x_1, x_2, x_3$) and a rotation by $\\frac{\\pi}{2}$ about a coordinate axis.\n\nFirst, consider a rotation by $\\pi$ about the $x_3$-axis. The transformation matrix is $\\mathbf{Q} = \\text{diag}(-1, -1, 1)$. The invariance condition $C_{ijkl} = Q_{ip}Q_{jq}Q_{kr}Q_{ls}C_{pqrs}$ must hold. A component $C_{ijkl}$ remains unchanged only if the product $Q_{ii}Q_{jj}Q_{kk}Q_{ll}$ (summation implied, but here indices are fixed) is $+1$. Any component with an odd number of indices equal to $1$ or $2$ will change sign. For instance, $C'_{1113} = Q_{11}Q_{11}Q_{11}Q_{33}C_{1113} = (-1)(-1)(-1)(1)C_{1113} = -C_{1113}$. For invariance, we must have $C_{1113}=0$. Applying this logic for $\\pi$ rotations about all three axes demonstrates that the only non-zero components are of the form $C_{iiii}$, $C_{iijj}$ (with $i \\ne j$), and $C_{ijij}$ (with $i \\ne j$). This is the form for an orthotropic material, which has $9$ independent constants. In Voigt matrix notation, this corresponds to:\n$$\n\\mathbf{C}_{\\text{ortho}} = \\begin{pmatrix} C_{11} & C_{12} & C_{13} & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ C_{12} & C_{22} & C_{23} & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ C_{13} & C_{23} & C_{33} & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 & C_{44} & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & C_{55} & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & C_{66} \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nHere, the Voigt notation mapping is $11 \\to 1$, $22 \\to 2$, $33 \\to 3$, $23 \\to 4$, $13 \\to 5$, $12 \\to 6$. The components are $C_{11}=C_{1111}$, $C_{12}=C_{1122}$, $C_{44}=C_{2323}$, etc.\n\nNext, we impose a higher symmetry of the cubic group, such as a rotation by $\\frac{\\pi}{2}$ about the $x_3$-axis. The transformation matrix is $\\mathbf{Q}$ such that $x_1' = x_2, x_2' = -x_1, x_3' = x_3$. Its components are $Q_{12}=1$, $Q_{21}=-1$, $Q_{33}=1$, and all others are zero.\nApplying the invariance condition $C_{pqrs} = Q_{pi} Q_{qj} Q_{rk} Q_{sl}\\, C_{ijkl}$:\n- For $C_{1111}$: $C_{1111}' = Q_{1i}Q_{1j}Q_{1k}Q_{1l}C_{ijkl} = Q_{12}Q_{12}Q_{12}Q_{12}C_{2222} = C_{2222}$. Invariance requires $C_{1111} = C_{2222}$.\n- By considering a $\\frac{\\pi}{2}$ rotation about the $x_1$-axis, we can similarly show $C_{2222} = C_{3333}$. Thus, $C_{1111} = C_{2222} = C_{3333}$. In Voigt notation, this implies $C_{11}=C_{22}=C_{33}$.\n\n- For $C_{1133}$: $C_{1133}' = Q_{1i}Q_{1j}Q_{3k}Q_{3l}C_{ijkl} = Q_{12}Q_{12}Q_{33}Q_{33}C_{2233} = C_{2233}$. Invariance requires $C_{1133} = C_{2233}$.\n- By symmetry of axis permutations, we must also have $C_{1122} = C_{1133} = C_{2233}$. Due to the major symmetry $C_{iijj}=C_{jji i}$, all off-diagonal normal components are equal. In Voigt notation, this means $C_{12}=C_{13}=C_{23}$.\n\n- For $C_{2323}$: $C_{2323}' = Q_{2i}Q_{3j}Q_{2k}Q_{3l}C_{ijkl} = Q_{21}Q_{33}Q_{21}Q_{33}C_{1313} = (-1)(1)(-1)(1)C_{1313} = C_{1313}$. Invariance requires $C_{2323} = C_{1313}$.\n- By axis permutations, we must also have $C_{1212} = C_{2323} = C_{1313}$. In Voigt notation, this means $C_{44}=C_{55}=C_{66}$.\n\nThe orthotropic matrix thus reduces to the form for a cubic material with $3$ independent constants, $C_{11}$, $C_{12}$, and $C_{44}$:\n$$\n\\mathbf{C} = \\begin{pmatrix} C_{11} & C_{12} & C_{12} & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ C_{12} & C_{11} & C_{12} & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ C_{12} & C_{12} & C_{11} & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 & C_{44} & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & C_{44} & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & C_{44} \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThis is the most general form consistent with cubic symmetry.\n\nPart 2: Compliance matrix $\\mathbb{S}$ and engineering constants\nThe compliance matrix $\\mathbf{S}$ is the inverse of the stiffness matrix $\\mathbf{C}$. Since $\\mathbf{C}$ is block-diagonal, we can invert the blocks separately.\nThe shear part is trivial: the inverse of the diagonal matrix $\\text{diag}(C_{44}, C_{44}, C_{44})$ is $\\text{diag}(1/C_{44}, 1/C_{44}, 1/C_{44})$. This gives $S_{44}=S_{55}=S_{66}=1/C_{44}$.\nFor the normal stress-strain part, we must invert the $3 \\times 3$ matrix:\n$$ \\mathbf{C}_{\\text{norm}} = \\begin{pmatrix} C_{11} & C_{12} & C_{12} \\\\ C_{12} & C_{11} & C_{12} \\\\ C_{12} & C_{12} & C_{11} \\end{pmatrix} $$\nThe determinant is $\\det(\\mathbf{C}_{\\text{norm}}) = (C_{11}-C_{12})^2(C_{11}+2C_{12})$.\nThe inverse matrix $\\mathbf{S}_{\\text{norm}} = \\mathbf{C}_{\\text{norm}}^{-1}$ is found via the adjugate method. The components of $\\mathbf{S}_{\\text{norm}}$ are:\n$$ S_{11} = \\frac{C_{11}^2 - C_{12}^2}{\\det(\\mathbf{C}_{\\text{norm}})} = \\frac{(C_{11}-C_{12})(C_{11}+C_{12})}{(C_{11}-C_{12})^2(C_{11}+2C_{12})} = \\frac{C_{11}+C_{12}}{(C_{11}-C_{12})(C_{11}+2C_{12})} $$\n$$ S_{12} = \\frac{C_{12}^2 - C_{11}C_{12}}{\\det(\\mathbf{C}_{\\text{norm}})} = \\frac{-C_{12}(C_{11}-C_{12})}{(C_{11}-C_{12})^2(C_{11}+2C_{12})} = \\frac{-C_{12}}{(C_{11}-C_{12})(C_{11}+2C_{12})} $$\nThe full compliance matrix $\\mathbf{S}$ has the same structure as $\\mathbf{C}$, with components $S_{11}$, $S_{12}$, and $S_{44}$.\n\nNow we relate these components to the engineering constants for loading along a cube axis. Consider uniaxial tension along the $x_1$-axis, so $\\sigma_1 \\ne 0$ and all other $\\sigma_i=0$. From $\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon} = \\mathbf{S}\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}$:\n- Axial strain: $\\varepsilon_1 = S_{11}\\sigma_1$\n- Transverse strain: $\\varepsilon_2 = S_{12}\\sigma_1$ and $\\varepsilon_3 = S_{12}\\sigma_1$\nYoung's modulus is $E = \\sigma_1/\\varepsilon_1 = 1/S_{11}$.\n$$ E = \\frac{1}{S_{11}} = \\frac{(C_{11}-C_{12})(C_{11}+2C_{12})}{C_{11}+C_{12}} $$\nPoisson's ratio is $\\nu = -\\varepsilon_2/\\varepsilon_1 = -S_{12}/S_{11}$.\n$$ \\nu = -\\frac{S_{12}}{S_{11}} = -\\frac{-C_{12}/((C_{11}-C_{12})(C_{11}+2C_{12}))}{(C_{11}+C_{12})/((C_{11}-C_{12})(C_{11}+2C_{12}))} = \\frac{C_{12}}{C_{11}+C_{12}} $$\nFor pure shear on a coordinate plane, e.g., the $1-2$ plane, we have $\\sigma_6 = \\sigma_{12} \\ne 0$ and other stresses are zero. The engineering shear strain is $\\gamma_{12} = \\varepsilon_6 = S_{66}\\sigma_6$. The shear modulus $G$ is defined as $G = \\sigma_6/\\varepsilon_6 = 1/S_{66}$. Since $S_{66}=S_{44}=1/C_{44}$, we have:\n$$ G = C_{44} $$\nThis result is consistent with the tensorial relation $\\sigma_{12} = 2C_{1212}\\varepsilon_{12}$ and the engineering definition $G = \\sigma_{12}/\\gamma_{12} = \\sigma_{12}/(2\\varepsilon_{12})$, which gives $G=C_{1212}$. For cubic materials, $C_{1212}=C_{44}$ (Voigt).\n\nPart 3: Constraints and distinctions\nFor a general orthotropic material, the compliance matrix is described by $9$ independent engineering constants: $E_1, E_2, E_3, \\nu_{12}, \\nu_{23}, \\nu_{31}, G_{12}, G_{23}, G_{31}$. The compliance matrix is:\n$$ \\mathbf{S}_{\\text{ortho}} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1/E_1 & -\\nu_{12}/E_1 & -\\nu_{13}/E_1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ -\\nu_{21}/E_2 & 1/E_2 & -\\nu_{23}/E_2 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ -\\nu_{31}/E_3 & -\\nu_{32}/E_3 & 1/E_3 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 1/G_{23} & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1/G_{13} & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1/G_{12} \\end{pmatrix} $$\nwhere symmetry requires $\\nu_{ij}/E_i = \\nu_{ji}/E_j$.\nComparing this to the cubic compliance matrix reveals the following constraints for cubic symmetry:\n1.  Diagonal normal components are equal: $S_{11}=S_{22}=S_{33} \\Rightarrow 1/E_1 = 1/E_2 = 1/E_3$, so $E_1=E_2=E_3$.\n2.  Off-diagonal normal components are equal: $S_{12}=S_{13}=S_{23} \\Rightarrow \\nu_{12}/E_1 = \\nu_{13}/E_1 = \\nu_{23}/E_2$. With $E_1=E_2$, this implies $\\nu_{12} = \\nu_{13} = \\nu_{23}$.\n3.  Shear components are equal: $S_{44}=S_{55}=S_{66} \\Rightarrow 1/G_{23} = 1/G_{13} = 1/G_{12}$, so $G_{12}=G_{23}=G_{13}$.\n\nThese constraints reduce the $9$ independent constants of an orthotropic material to $3$ for a cubic material. An orthotropic material, like wood, does not satisfy these equalities.\n\nTo distinguish cubic from isotropic elasticity, we note that an isotropic material has only $2$ independent elastic constants (e.g., $E$ and $\\nu$), with the shear modulus given by the relation $G = E / (2(1+\\nu))$. A cubic material is isotropic if and only if its constants satisfy this additional constraint. Substituting our derived expressions for $E$, $\\nu$, and $G$:\n$$ C_{44} = \\frac{\\frac{(C_{11}-C_{12})(C_{11}+2C_{12})}{C_{11}+C_{12}}}{2\\left(1 + \\frac{C_{12}}{C_{11}+C_{12}}\\right)} = \\frac{\\frac{(C_{11}-C_{12})(C_{11}+2C_{12})}{C_{11}+C_{12}}}{2\\left(\\frac{C_{11}+C_{12}+C_{12}}{C_{11}+C_{12}}\\right)} = \\frac{(C_{11}-C_{12})(C_{11}+2C_{12})}{2(C_{11}+2C_{12})} $$\n$$ C_{44} = \\frac{C_{11}-C_{12}}{2} $$\nThis is known as the isotropy condition for a cubic material. Anisotropy is often quantified by the Zener ratio, $A = 2C_{44}/(C_{11}-C_{12})$, which must equal $1$ for isotropy. Thus, a cubic material is more general than an isotropic one, becoming isotropic only when the material constants satisfy the specific algebraic relation $2C_{44} = C_{11}-C_{12}$.\nThe final answer required is the ordered triple $(E, \\nu, G)$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{(C_{11}-C_{12})(C_{11}+2C_{12})}{C_{11}+C_{12}} & \\frac{C_{12}}{C_{11}+C_{12}} & C_{44} \\end{pmatrix}}\n$$", "id": "2658748"}, {"introduction": "Material symmetry governs not just the form of the stiffness tensor, but also the fundamental modes in which a material can deform.

We shall proceed with the analysis by following the prescribed steps.\n\nThe subject of this problem is a homogeneous linear elastic solid whose material response is characterized by the fourth-order stiffness operator $\\mathbb{C}$. The material possesses transverse isotropy about a fixed unit vector $\\boldsymbol{n}$. This means that the material's properties are invariant under any rotation (proper or improper) belonging to the group $G = \\{\\boldsymbol{R} \\in \\mathrm{O}(3) | \\boldsymbol{R}\\boldsymbol{n} = \\boldsymbol{n}\\}$. The invariance of the stiffness operator is expressed as:\n$$ \\boldsymbol{R} \\cdot (\\mathbb{C} : (\\boldsymbol{R}^T \\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon} \\boldsymbol{R})) \\cdot \\boldsymbol{R}^T = \\mathbb{C} : \\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon} \\quad \\forall \\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon} \\in \\mathrm{Sym}(3), \\forall \\boldsymbol{R} \\in G $$\nThis is equivalent to the condition that $\\mathbb{C}$ must commute with the action of the symmetry group, which in tensorial form is written as $C_{ijkl} = R_{ia} R_{jb} R_{kc} R_{ld} C_{abcd}$ for all $\\boldsymbol{R} \\in G$.\n\nPart 1: Decomposition of the Space of Symmetric Tensors\n\nWe introduce the orthogonal projection operators $\\boldsymbol{P} = \\boldsymbol{n} \\otimes \\boldsymbol{n}$ and $\\boldsymbol{Q} = \\boldsymbol{I} - \\boldsymbol{P}$, where $\\boldsymbol{I}$ is the second-order identity tensor. These projectors are orthogonal, $\\boldsymbol{P}:\\boldsymbol{Q} = 0$, and complete, $\\boldsymbol{P}+\\boldsymbol{Q}=\\boldsymbol{I}$. The space of symmetric second-order tensors, $\\mathrm{Sym}(3)$, can be decomposed into subspaces that are invariant under the action of the symmetry group $G$. Any symmetric tensor $\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}$ can be uniquely decomposed as follows:\n$$ \\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon} = \\boldsymbol{P}\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}\\boldsymbol{P} + (\\boldsymbol{P}\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}\\boldsymbol{Q} + \\boldsymbol{Q}\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}\\boldsymbol{P}) + \\boldsymbol{Q}\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}\\boldsymbol{Q} $$\nThis decomposition separates the tensor into its axial, shear, and planar components. We refine this further.\n\n1.  **Axial Normal Component**: The term $\\boldsymbol{P}\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}\\boldsymbol{P} = (\\boldsymbol{n} \\cdot \\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon} \\boldsymbol{n}) (\\boldsymbol{n} \\otimes \\boldsymbol{n}) = \\varepsilon_{nn} \\boldsymbol{P}$ represents the normal strain component along the symmetry axis $\\boldsymbol{n}$. This forms a one-dimensional invariant subspace spanned by $\\boldsymbol{P}$, corresponding to **(i) axial normal strains**.\n\n2.  **Planar Component**: The term $\\boldsymbol{Q}\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}\\boldsymbol{Q}$ is a symmetric tensor with its range and domain in the plane perpendicular to $\\boldsymbol{n}$. It can be decomposed into an isotropic (trace) part and a deviatoric (traceless) part within that plane.\n    *   The planar trace is $\\mathrm{tr}_{\\perp}(\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}) = \\boldsymbol{Q}:\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}$. The isotropic part is represented by $\\frac{1}{2}(\\boldsymbol{Q}:\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon})\\boldsymbol{Q}$, since $\\mathrm{tr}(\\boldsymbol{Q})=2$. This forms a one-dimensional invariant subspace spanned by $\\boldsymbol{Q}$, corresponding to **(ii) in-plane isotropic normal strains**.\n    *   The deviatoric part is $\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}_{\\mathrm{dev}} = \\boldsymbol{Q}\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}\\boldsymbol{Q} - \\frac{1}{2}(\\boldsymbol{Q}:\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon})\\boldsymbol{Q}$. This is a two-dimensional subspace of traceless symmetric tensors in the transverse plane, corresponding to **(iii) in-plane deviatoric strains**, which includes in-plane shear.\n\n3.  **Axial Shear Component**: The term $\\boldsymbol{P}\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}\\boldsymbol{Q} + \\boldsymbol{Q}\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}\\boldsymbol{P}$ represents the shear interaction between the axial direction and the transverse plane. This forms a two-dimensional invariant subspace corresponding to **(iv) axial shear strains**.\n\nBy Schur's lemma, since these four subspaces are invariant under the symmetry group, the operator $\\mathbb{C}$ cannot map vectors from one subspace to another, and its action within the two-dimensional subspaces (axial shear and in-plane deviatoric strains) is isotropic, i.e., a scalar multiple of the identity on that subspace. The action on the two one-dimensional normal strain subspaces couples them, forming a $2 \\times 2$ block.\n\nPart 2: Stiffness Moduli and Part 3: Spectral Decomposition\n\nWe perform the analysis in a Cartesian basis $\\{\\boldsymbol{e}_1, \\boldsymbol{e}_2, \\boldsymbol{e}_3\\}$ where the axis of symmetry is $\\boldsymbol{n} = \\boldsymbol{e}_3$. The stiffness operator components are the given five independent moduli $C_{11}, C_{33}, C_{12}, C_{13}, C_{44}$. We find the eigenvalues of $\\mathbb{C}$ by examining its action on each invariant subspace. Eigenvalues of a fourth-order tensor are scalars $\\lambda$ such that there exists a non-zero symmetric second-order tensor $\\boldsymbol{E}$ (an eigen-tensor) for which $\\mathbb{C}:\\boldsymbol{E} = \\lambda\\boldsymbol{E}$.\n\n**Shear Mode Eigenvalues**\n\n*   **Axial Shear Eigenvalue ($\\lambda_{\\mathrm{A}}$)**: We consider an eigen-tensor from the axial shear subspace, for instance $\\boldsymbol{E}_{\\mathrm{A}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(\\boldsymbol{e}_1 \\otimes \\boldsymbol{e}_3 + \\boldsymbol{e}_3 \\otimes \\boldsymbol{e}_1)$. The only non-zero components are $E_{13} = E_{31} = 1/\\sqrt{2}$. The stress tensor is $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma} = \\mathbb{C}:\\boldsymbol{E}_{\\mathrm{A}}$. The relevant component is $\\sigma_{13} = C_{13kl}E_{kl} = C_{1313}E_{13} + C_{1331}E_{31}$. In standard Voigt notation, $C_{44} = C_{1313} = C_{2323}$. Using minor symmetries, $\\sigma_{13} = 2C_{44}E_{13}$. Thus, $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma} = 2C_{44}\\boldsymbol{E}_{\\mathrm{A}}$.
