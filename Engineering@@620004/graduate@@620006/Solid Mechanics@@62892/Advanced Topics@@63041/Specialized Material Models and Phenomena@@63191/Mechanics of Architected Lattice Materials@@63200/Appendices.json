The derivation relies solely on the principles of linear algebra and the definitions provided.\n\nLet $\\mathbf{u}$ be the vector of nodal displacement components for the unit cell. For a two-dimensional system ($d=2$) with $n_{n}$ nodes per unit cell, the total number of degrees of freedom is $d n_{n}$.

From any given joint, bars connect to its six nearest neighbors. Due to the periodicity and symmetry of the lattice, we only need to consider the three unique orientations of these bars. These orientations are parallel to the Cartesian axes. Let the standard basis vectors be $\\boldsymbol{e}_1 = (1, 0, 0)^T$, $\\boldsymbol{e}_2 = (0, 1, 0)^T$, and $\\boldsymbol{e}_3 = (0, 0, 1)^T$.
