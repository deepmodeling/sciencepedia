It is a well-posed, scientifically grounded problem from the field of solid mechanics. A full solution will be provided.\n\nThe derivation begins with the equation of motion in a continuous medium, which is an expression of the conservation of linear momentum. In the absence of body forces, this is given by Cauchy's first law of motion:\n$$ \\rho \\frac{\\partial^2 u_i}{\\partial t^2} = \\frac{\\partial \\sigma_{ij}}{\\partial x_j} $$\nwhere $\\rho$ is the mass density, $\\boldsymbol{u}$ is the displacement vector, and $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}$ is the stress tensor. The indices $i, j$ range from $1$ to $3$, and summation over repeated indices is implied.\n\nThe stress tensor is related to the strain tensor $\\boldsymbol{\\epsilon}$ through the linear constitutive relation, or Hooke's law, for an anisotropic solid:\n$$ \\sigma_{ij} = C_{ijkl} \\epsilon_{kl} $$\nwhere $\\boldsymbol{C}$ is the fourth-rank elasticity tensor. For small-amplitude waves, the strain tensor is defined as:\n$$ \\epsilon_{kl} = \\frac{1}{2} \\left( \\frac{\\partial u_k}{\\partial x_l} + \\frac{\\partial u_l}{\\partial x_k} \\right) $$\nSubstituting the strain definition into Hooke's law, and utilizing the major symmetry $C_{ijkl} = C_{klij}$, gives:\n$$ \\sigma_{ij} = C_{ijkl} \\frac{\\partial u_k}{\\partial x_l} $$\nSubstituting this into the equation of motion for a homogeneous medium where $C_{ijkl}$ are constant in space yields the wave equation:\n$$ \\rho \\frac{\\partial^2 u_i}{\\partial t^2} = C_{ijkl} \\frac{\\partial^2 u_k}{\\partial x_j \\partial x_l} $$\nWe seek a plane-wave solution of the form:\n$$ u_i(\\boldsymbol{x}, t) = p_i \\exp[i(k_m x_m - \\omega t)] = p_i \\exp[i(k \\boldsymbol{n} \\cdot \\boldsymbol{x} - \\omega t)] $$\nwhere $p_i$ is the $i$-th component of the polarization vector $\\boldsymbol{p}$, $\\omega$ is the angular frequency, $\\boldsymbol{k}$ is the wave vector with magnitude $k$ and direction $\\boldsymbol{n}$ (a unit vector, so $k_m = k n_m$).\n\nTaking the derivatives of the plane-wave ansatz:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial^2 u_i}{\\partial t^2} = (-\\omega^2) p_i \\exp[\\dots] $$\n$$ \\frac{\\partial^2 u_k}{\\partial x_j \\partial x_l} = (i k n_j)(i k n_l) p_k \\exp[\\dots] = -k^2 n_j n_l p_k \\exp[\\dots] $$\nSubstituting these into the wave equation and cancelling the exponential term results in:\n$$ \\rho \\omega^2 p_i = C_{ijkl} k^2 n_j n_l p_k $$\nIntroducing the phase velocity $v = \\omega/k$, we have $\\omega^2 = v^2 k^2$. Substituting and cancelling $k^2$ gives:\n$$ C_{ijkl} n_j n_l p_k = \\rho v^2 p_i $$\nThis is the acoustic eigenproblem.

The eigenvalues of this system, $\\lambda = \\rho v^2$, determine the phase velocities, and the corresponding eigenvectors $\\boldsymbol{p}$ determine the wave polarizations.\n\nFor a cubic crystal, the non-zero components of the stiffness tensor, in Voigt notation, are $C_{11}$, $C_{12}$, and $C_{44}$. The components of the Christoffel tensor $\\boldsymbol{\\Gamma}$ for a general propagation direction $\\boldsymbol{n} = (n_1, n_2, n_3)$ are:\n$$ \\Gamma_{11} = C_{11} n_1^2 + C_{44} (n_2^2 + n_3^2) = (C_{11}-C_{44})n_1^2 + C_{44} $$\n$$ \\Gamma_{22} = C_{11} n_2^2 + C_{44} (n_1^2 + n_3^2) = (C_{11}-C_{44})n_2^2 + C_{44} $$\n$$ \\Gamma_{33} = C_{11} n_3^2 + C_{44} (n_1^2 + n_2^2) = (C_{11}-C_{44})n_3^2 + C_{44} $$\n$$ \\Gamma_{12} = (C_{12} + C_{44}) n_1 n_2 $$\n$$ \\Gamma_{13} = (C_{12} + C_{44}) n_1 n_3 $$\n$$ \\Gamma_{23} = (C_{12} + C_{44}) n_2 n_3 $$\nWe now solve the eigenproblem $\\boldsymbol{\\Gamma} \\boldsymbol{p} = \\rho v^2 \\boldsymbol{p}$ for the specified high-symmetry directions. In these directions, the modes are not quasi- but are purely longitudinal or transverse.\n\n**Case 1: Propagation along $[100]$**\nThe propagation vector is $\\boldsymbol{n} = (1, 0, 0)$.\nThe Christoffel tensor becomes diagonal:\n$$ \\boldsymbol{\\Gamma}^{[100]} = \\begin{pmatrix} C_{11} & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & C_{44} & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & C_{44} \\end{pmatrix} $$\nThe eigenvalues are $\\lambda_1 = C_{11}$ and $\\lambda_{2,3} = C_{44}$ (degenerate).\nThe corresponding velocities are found from $\\rho v^2 = \\lambda$:\n- For $\\lambda_1 = C_{11}$, the polarization is $\\boldsymbol{p} \\parallel (1, 0, 0)$, which is parallel to $\\boldsymbol{n}$. This is a pure longitudinal (L) mode. The velocity is $v_{\\mathrm{L}}^{[100]} = \\sqrt{C_{11}/\\rho}$.\n- For $\\lambda_{2,3} = C_{44}$, the polarizations are any vectors in the plane orthogonal to $\\boldsymbol{n}$, e.g., $(0, 1, 0)$ and $(0, 0, 1)$. These are pure transverse (T) modes. The velocity is $v_{\\mathrm{T}}^{[100]} = \\sqrt{C_{44}/\\rho}$.\n\n**Case 2: Propagation along $[110]$**\nThe normalized propagation vector is $\\boldsymbol{n} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(1, 1, 0)$.\nThe Christoffel tensor becomes:\n$$ \\boldsymbol{\\Gamma}^{[110]} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{1}{2}(C_{11}+C_{44}) & \\frac{1}{2}(C_{12}+C_{44}) & 0 \\\\ \\frac{1}{2}(C_{12}+C_{44}) & \\frac{1}{2}(C_{11}+C_{44}) & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & C_{44} \\end{pmatrix} $$\nThis matrix is block-diagonal.\n- One eigenvalue is immediately apparent: $\\lambda_1 = C_{44}$. The eigenvector is $\\boldsymbol{p} = (0, 0, 1)$. This polarization is perpendicular to the propagation plane (the $xy$-plane), so it is a pure transverse mode, specifically the out-of-plane mode. The velocity is $v_{\\mathrm{T,out}}^{[110]} = \\sqrt{C_{44}/\\rho}$.\n- The other two eigenvalues come from the top-left $2 \\times 2$ submatrix. The characteristic equation is $(\\frac{1}{2}(C_{11}+C_{44}) - \\lambda)^2 - (\\frac{1}{2}(C_{12}+C_{44}))^2 = 0$.\n  - $\\lambda_2 = \\frac{1}{2}(C_{11}+C_{44} + C_{12}+C_{44}) = \\frac{1}{2}(C_{11}+C_{12}+2C_{44})$. The polarization is $\\boldsymbol{p} \\parallel (1, 1, 0)$, which is parallel to $\\boldsymbol{n}$. This is a pure longitudinal mode. The velocity is $v_{\\mathrm{L}}^{[110]} = \\sqrt{\\frac{C_{11}+C_{12}+2C_{44}}{2\\rho}}$.\n  - $\\lambda_3 = \\frac{1}{2}(C_{11}+C_{44} - (C_{12}+C_{44})) = \\frac{1}{2}(C_{11}-C_{12})$. The polarization is $\\boldsymbol{p} \\parallel (1, -1, 0)$, which is perpendicular to $\\boldsymbol{n}$ and lies in the propagation plane. This is the in-plane pure transverse mode. The velocity is $v_{\\mathrm{T,in}}^{[110]} = \\sqrt{\\frac{C_{11}-C_{12}}{2\\rho}}$.\n\n**Case 3: Propagation along $[111]$**\nThe normalized propagation vector is $\\boldsymbol{n} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}}(1, 1, 1)$.\nThe Christoffel tensor components are $\\Gamma_{ii} = \\frac{1}{3}(C_{11}+2C_{44})$ and $\\Gamma_{ij} = \\frac{1}{3}(C_{12}+C_{44})$ for $i \\neq j$.\n$$ \\boldsymbol{\\Gamma}^{[111]} = \\frac{1}{3} \\begin{pmatrix} C_{11}+2C_{44} & C_{12}+C_{44} & C_{12}+C_{44} \\\\ C_{12}+C_{44} & C_{11}+2C_{44} & C_{12}+C_{44} \\\\ C_{12}+C_{44} & C_{12}+C_{44} & C_{11}+2C_{44} \\end{pmatrix} $$\n- One eigenvector, by symmetry, must correspond to the longitudinal mode with $\\boldsymbol{p} \\parallel (1, 1, 1)$. The corresponding eigenvalue is the sum of any row: $\\lambda_1 = \\frac{1}{3}(C_{11}+2C_{44} + 2(C_{12}+C_{44})) = \\frac{1}{3}(C_{11}+2C_{12}+4C_{44})$. This is the longitudinal mode. The velocity is $v_{\\mathrm{L}}^{[111]} = \\sqrt{\\frac{C_{11}+2C_{12}+4C_{44}}{3\\rho}}$.\n- The other two modes are transverse and degenerate due to the threefold rotational symmetry around the $[111]$ axis. Their eigenvalues can be found using the trace of the matrix: $\\mathrm{Tr}(\\boldsymbol{\\Gamma}) = \\lambda_1 + 2\\lambda_T$.\n  $\\mathrm{Tr}(\\boldsymbol{\\Gamma}) = C_{11}+2C_{44}$.\n  $2\\lambda_T = (C_{11}+2C_{44}) - \\frac{1}{3}(C_{11}+2C_{12}+4C_{44}) = \\frac{1}{3}(2C_{11}-2C_{12}+2C_{44})$.\n  $\\lambda_T = \\frac{1}{3}(C_{11}-C_{12}+C_{44})$.\n  These modes have polarizations in the plane perpendicular to $\\boldsymbol{n}$, so they are pure transverse modes.

A full solution will be provided.\n\nThe power transmission coefficient $T$ for the given four-layer stack will be computed using two independent methods to ensure correctness.\n\n**Method 1: Impedance Transformation Approach**\nThis method involves calculating the effective acoustic impedance at the front of the stack by transforming the load impedance of the substrate layer by layer. The reflection coefficient, and subsequently the transmission coefficient, can then be found.\n\nThe input impedance $Z_{in}$ of a medium with characteristic impedance $Z_m$ and thickness $d$, terminated by a load impedance $Z_L$, is given by:\n$$Z_{in} = Z_m \\frac{Z_L \\cos(k d) + i Z_m \\sin(k d)}{Z_m \\cos(k d) + i Z_L \\sin(k d)}$$\nFor a quarter-wave layer, $k d = \\pi/2$. This implies $\\cos(k d) = 0$ and $\\sin(k d) = 1$. The formula simplifies significantly to:\n$$Z_{in} = Z_m \\frac{i Z_m}{i Z_L} = \\frac{Z_m^2}{Z_L}$$\nThe stack is $A$-$B$-$A$-$B$. The incident medium is $0$ and the substrate is $s$. We are given $Z_0 = Z_A$ and $Z_s = Z_A$.\nThe amplitude reflection coefficient at the first interface (medium $0$ to layer $A$) is $R_{0A} = (Z_A - Z_0)/(Z_A + Z_0) = 0$. This means the wave enters the first layer $A$ without any reflection. The problem is therefore equivalent to calculating the transmission of a wave propagating in a semi-infinite medium $A$ through a stack of $B$-$A$-$B$, which is terminated by a semi-infinite medium $A$.\n\nWe proceed by calculating the input impedance of this effective stack, starting from the load and moving backward.\n1.  The load is the substrate, which has impedance $Z_L = Z_s = Z_A$.\n2.  This load is seen through the last layer, which is layer $B$ of thickness $d_B$. The input impedance at the front of this layer, which we denote $Z_{in,1}$, is:\n    $$Z_{in,1} = \\frac{Z_B^2}{Z_L} = \\frac{Z_B^2}{Z_A}$$\n3.  $Z_{in,1}$ becomes the load for the middle layer, which is layer $A$ of thickness $d_A$. The input impedance at the front of this layer, $Z_{in,2}$, is:\n    $$Z_{in,2} = \\frac{Z_A^2}{Z_{in,1}} = \\frac{Z_A^2}{Z_B^2 / Z_A} = \\frac{Z_A^3}{Z_B^2}$$\n4.  $Z_{in,2}$ is the load for the first layer of our effective stack, layer $B$ of thickness $d_B$. The total input impedance of the $B$-$A$-$B$ stack, $Z_{in,total}$, is:\n    $$Z_{in,total} = \\frac{Z_B^2}{Z_{in,2}} = \\frac{Z_B^2}{Z_A^3 / Z_B^2} = \\frac{Z_B^4}{Z_A^3}$$\nThis is the impedance seen by the wave at the interface between the initial medium $A$ and the first layer $B$. The amplitude reflection coefficient $R$ for the entire stack is therefore:\n$$R = \\frac{Z_{in,total} - Z_A}{Z_{in,total} + Z_A} = \\frac{\\frac{Z_B^4}{Z_A^3} - Z_A}{\\frac{Z_B^4}{Z_A^3} + Z_A} = \\frac{Z_B^4 - Z_A^4}{Z_B^4 + Z_A^4} = - \\frac{(Z_A/Z_B)^4 - 1}{(Z_A/Z_B)^4 + 1}$$\nThe power reflection coefficient $\\mathcal{R}$ is the squared magnitude of $R$:\n$$\\mathcal{R} = |R|^2 = \\left(\\frac{(Z_A/Z_B)^4 - 1}{(Z_A/Z_B)^4 + 1}\\right)^2$$\nSince all media are lossless, the power transmission coefficient $T$ is given by $T = 1 - \\mathcal{R}$.\n$$T = 1 - \\left(\\frac{(Z_A/Z_B)^4 - 1}{(Z_A/Z_B)^4 + 1}\\right)^2$$\n\n**Method 2: Transfer Matrix Method**\nThe transfer matrix $M_j$ for a layer $j$ relates the state vector (pressure $p$, particle velocity $v_z$) at the input of the layer ($z=0$) to the state vector at the output ($z=d_j$):\n$$\\begin{pmatrix} p(0) \\\\ v_z(0) \\end{pmatrix} = M_j \\begin{pmatrix} p(d_j) \\\\ v_z(d_j) \\end{pmatrix}$$\nFor a layer of thickness $d_j$ and impedance $Z_j$, the matrix is:\n$$M_j = \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos(k_j d_j) & i Z_j \\sin(k_j d_j) \\\\ \\frac{i}{Z_j} \\sin(k_j d_j) & \\cos(k_j d_j) \\end{pmatrix}$$\nFor a quarter-wave layer where $k_j d_j = \\pi/2$, this matrix simplifies to:\n$$M_j = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & i Z_j \\\\ \\frac{i}{Z_j} & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$$\nThe total transfer matrix for the $A$-$B$-$A$-$B$ stack is the product of the individual matrices: $M_{total} = M_A M_B M_A M_B = (M_A M_B)^2$. First, we compute the matrix for a single $A$-$B$ unit cell, $M_{AB}$:\n$$M_{AB} = M_A M_B = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & i Z_A \\\\ \\frac{i}{Z_A} & 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & i Z_B \\\\ \\frac{i}{Z_B} & 0 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} (i Z_A)(\\frac{i}{Z_B}) & 0 \\\\ 0 & (\\frac{i}{Z_A})(i Z_B) \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} -\\frac{Z_A}{Z_B} & 0 \\\\ 0 & -\\frac{Z_B}{Z_A} \\end{pmatrix}$$\nThe total matrix for two cells is $M_{total} = (M_{AB})^2$:\n$$M_{total} = \\begin{pmatrix} -\\frac{Z_A}{Z_B} & 0 \\\\ 0 & -\\frac{Z_B}{Z_A} \\end{pmatrix}^2 = \\begin{pmatrix} \\left(\\frac{Z_A}{Z_B}\\right)^2 & 0 \\\\ 0 & \\left(\\frac{Z_B}{Z_A}\\right)^2 \\end{pmatrix}$$\nLet the input (front of the stack) be at $z=0$ and the output (back of the stack) be at $z=L$.

It is deemed **valid**. A solution will be developed.\n\n**Solution Procedure Justification**\nThe governing equation is a linear, second-order partial differential equation of the form $\\mathcal{L}u = \\lambda u$, where $\\mathcal{L}$ is a self-adjoint differential operator with periodic coefficients, and the eigenvalue is related to frequency, $\\lambda \\propto \\omega^2$. Bloch's theorem transforms this into an eigenvalue problem on a single unit cell, where the Bloch wavevector $\\mathbf{k}$ enters as a parameter in the boundary conditions. Standard spectral theory for such operators establishes that the eigenvalues, and thus the band frequencies $\\omega_n(\\mathbf{k})$, are continuous functions of the parameter $\\mathbf{k}$.\n\nA band gap between band $n$ and band $n+1$ along a path exists if and only if the maximum frequency of band $n$ along the path is strictly less than the minimum frequency of band $n+1$ along the same path. Let the path be denoted by $\\mathcal{P}$. The condition for a band gap is:\n$$ \\sup_{\\mathbf{k} \\in \\mathcal{P}} \\omega_n(\\mathbf{k}) < \\inf_{\\mathbf{k} \\in \\mathcal{P}} \\omega_{n+1}(\\mathbf{k}) $$\nSince the path $\\mathcal{P}$ is a compact set (a closed and bounded line segment in $\\mathbb{R}^2$) and the functions $\\omega_n(\\mathbf{k})$ are continuous, the supremum and infimum are attained, and we can replace them with maximum and minimum. Let $\\omega_n^{\\text{max}} = \\max_{\\mathbf{k} \\in \\mathcal{P}} \\omega_n(\\mathbf{k})$ and $\\omega_{n+1}^{\\text{min}} = \\min_{\\mathbf{k} \\in \\mathcal{P}} \\omega_{n+1}(\\mathbf{k})$. A gap exists if $\\omega_n^{\\text{max}} < \\omega_{n+1}^{\\text{min}}$.\n\nThe problem provides only a discrete sampling of these continuous bands. We are explicitly constrained to use *only* this sampled data. The standard, rigorous procedure in this context is to assume that the sampling of $\\mathbf{k}$-points is sufficiently dense to capture the extremal values of the frequency bands along the path. This is a practical assumption in nearly all computational studies of band structures. The procedure is therefore as follows:\n1. For a potential gap between band $n$ and band $n+1$, find the maximum frequency value among all sampled points for band $n$. Let this be $M_n = \\max_{i} \\{\\omega_n(\\mathbf{k}_i)\\}$.\n2. Find the minimum frequency value among all sampled points for band $n+1$. Let this be $m_{n+1} = \\min_{i} \\{\\omega_{n+1}(\\mathbf{k}_i)\\}$.\n3. If $M_n < m_{n+1}$, a band gap is declared to exist. The frequency range of this gap is the open interval $(M_n, m_{n+1})$.\n4. The midgap frequency is calculated as $\\frac{1}{2}(M_n + m_{n+1})$. If $M_n \\ge m_{n+1}$, the bands are considered to be closed (touching or overlapping), and no gap exists.\n\nThis procedure will now be applied to the provided data for bands $n=1, \\dots, 4$.
