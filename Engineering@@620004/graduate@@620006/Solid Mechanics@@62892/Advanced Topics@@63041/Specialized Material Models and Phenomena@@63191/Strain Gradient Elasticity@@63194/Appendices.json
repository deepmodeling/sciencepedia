Strain gradient elasticity is a well-established higher-order continuum theory used to capture size effects in materials. The formulation based on an energy density depending on strain and its gradient, $W(\\varepsilon, \\eta)$, is standard. The use of a variational principle to derive the governing equations and boundary conditions is the fundamental approach in this field. The problem is well-posed as a conceptual query about the mathematical structure of the theory. The language is objective and precise. The problem statement is free from scientific flaws, contradictions, or ambiguities.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. A solution will be derived.\n\n**Derivation of Governing Equation and Boundary Conditions**\n\nThe total potential energy, $\\Pi$, for the bar of cross-sectional area $A$ is the integral of the strain energy density minus the potential of external loads. For a linear, centrosymmetric material, the strain energy density $W$ can be expressed as a quadratic function of the strain $\\varepsilon = u_x$ and the strain gradient $\\eta = u_{xx}$:\n$$ W(\\varepsilon, \\eta) = \\frac{1}{2} E \\varepsilon^2 + \\frac{1}{2} c \\eta^2 = \\frac{1}{2} E (u_x)^2 + \\frac{1}{2} E \\ell^2 (u_{xx})^2 $$\nwhere $E$ is Young's modulus, and $c = E \\ell^2$ is a gradient coefficient, with $\\ell$ being an internal material length scale parameter.\n\nThe total potential energy functional is:\n$$ \\Pi[u] = \\int_{0}^{L} \\left[ A \\left( \\frac{1}{2} E (u_x)^2 + \\frac{1}{2} E \\ell^2 (u_{xx})^2 \\right) - f(x) u \\right] dx - W_{BC} $$\nwhere $f(x)$ is the distributed body force per unit length and $W_{BC}$ is the work done by actions at the boundaries $x=0$ and $x=L$.\n\nThe principle of minimum potential energy requires that the first variation of $\\Pi$ with respect to $u$ vanishes for any admissible variation $\\delta u$, i.e., $\\delta \\Pi = 0$.\n$$ \\delta \\Pi = \\int_{0}^{L} \\left[ A E u_x \\delta(u_x) + A E \\ell^2 u_{xx} \\delta(u_{xx}) - f \\delta u \\right] dx - \\delta W_{BC} = 0 $$\nUsing $\\delta(u_x) = (\\delta u)_x$ and $\\delta(u_{xx}) = (\\delta u)_{xx}$ and applying integration by parts:\n$$ \\int_{0}^{L} A E u_x (\\delta u)_x dx = [A E u_x \\delta u]_{0}^{L} - \\int_{0}^{L} A E u_{xx} \\delta u \\, dx $$\n$$ \\int_{0}^{L} A E \\ell^2 u_{xx} (\\delta u)_{xx} dx = [A E \\ell^2 u_{xx} (\\delta u)_x]_{0}^{L} - [A E \\ell^2 u_{xxx} \\delta u]_{0}^{L} + \\int_{0}^{L} A E \\ell^2 u_{xxxx} \\delta u \\, dx $$\n\nSubstituting these into the expression for $\\delta \\Pi$ and collecting terms yields:\n$$ \\int_{0}^{L} (A E \\ell^2 u_{xxxx} - A E u_{xx} - f) \\delta u \\, dx \\\\ + [ (A E u_x - A E \\ell^2 u_{xxx}) \\delta u ]_{0}^{L} \\\\ + [ A E \\ell^2 u_{xx} (\\delta u)_x ]_{0}^{L} - \\delta W_{BC} = 0 $$\nFor an arbitrary variation $\\delta u$ within the domain $(0, L)$, the integral part must be zero. This gives the governing fourth-order differential equation:\n$$ A E \\ell^2 u_{xxxx} - A E u_{xx} - f = 0 $$\nThe remaining boundary terms must also vanish. The work done by boundary actions involves pairs of conjugate kinematic variables and generalized forces: displacement $u$ and generalized traction $P$, and displacement gradient $u_x$ and higher-order traction (or double force) $M$.\n$$ \\delta W_{BC} = [P \\delta u + M \\delta u_x]_0^L $$\nBy comparing the boundary terms from the integration by parts with $\\delta W_{BC}$, we identify the generalized forces:\n- Generalized traction: $P = A(E u_x - E \\ell^2 u_{xxx})$\n- Higher-order traction: $M = A E \\ell^2 u_{xx}$\n\nAt each boundary point ($x=0$ or $x=L$), the boundary conditions must be specified. For a well-posed problem, at each end, one must specify a condition from each conjugate pair:\n1.  Either prescribe the displacement $u$ (essential boundary condition) OR prescribe the generalized traction $P$ (natural boundary condition).\n2.  Either prescribe the displacement gradient $u_x$ (essential boundary condition) OR prescribe the higher-order traction $M$ (natural boundary condition).\n\nSince the governing equation is of fourth order, a total of four boundary conditions are required to obtain a unique solution (up to a rigid body translation if displacement $u$ is not prescribed at any point). Prescribing $u_x$ at a boundary is a kinematic constraint, thus it is an essential boundary condition. It provides one of the four required data points for a unique solution. Physically, $u_x$ is the axial strain $\\varepsilon$, so prescribing it at a boundary means imposing a known strain there. Its energetic conjugate is the higher-order traction $M=AE\\ell^2 u_{xx}$.\n\n**Option-by-Option Analysis**\n\n**A. In a one-dimensional strain gradient elastic bar, prescribing $u_x$ at a boundary is an essential boundary condition.

Specifying $u_x$ contributes one essential datum at that boundary and, when combined with additional independent data (for example, $u$ or appropriate generalized tractions) so that there are $4$ in total, it leads to a unique solution up to removal of rigid-body translation by fixing one displacement value. Physically, $u_x$ at a boundary is the imposed surface strain, and its energetic conjugate is a higher-order traction (a “double force”) associated with the strain gradient.**\nThis statement is entirely consistent with our derivation.\n- It correctly identifies $u_x$ as an essential boundary condition.\n- It correctly states the order of the governing equation is $4$ and that $4$ boundary conditions are required.\n- It correctly explains that prescribing $u_x$ is one such valid condition.\n- It correctly addresses the uniqueness of the solution and the role of rigid-body translation.\n- It correctly identifies the physical meaning of $u_x$ as strain and its conjugate variable as a higher-order traction (\"double force\").\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. Prescribing $u_x$ at a boundary over-constrains the problem because it simultaneously fixes the displacement and the classical traction there, so it generally destroys existence and does not aid uniqueness.**\nThis statement is incorrect. Prescribing a value for the derivative $u_x$ at a point does not fix the function value $u$ at that point. Furthermore, as shown in the derivation, prescribing $u_x$ is a valid essential boundary condition, not a source of over-constraint.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. Prescribing $u_x$ at a boundary does not affect uniqueness because the governing equation is of order $2$; only displacement or classical traction data matter, as in classical elasticity.**\nThis statement describes classical elasticity (where $\\ell=0$, leading to a second-order equation $-AEu_{xx}=f$), not strain gradient elasticity. The problem explicitly states a theory where the energy depends on the strain gradient, which necessarily leads to a higher-than-second-order governing equation, as derived.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. The physical meaning of prescribing $u_x$ at a boundary is setting a boundary curvature, which pertains only to bending of beams and plates, not to axial bars; therefore it is not an admissible boundary condition in strain gradient elasticity of bars.**\nThis statement incorrectly associates $u_x$ with curvature. In the context of a 1D bar with axial displacement $u(x)$, $u_x$ represents the axial strain. Curvature is related to the second derivative of transverse displacement, which is not the kinematic variable in this problem. The condition is perfectly admissible.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**E. In strain gradient elasticity, prescribing $u_x$ is equivalent to prescribing the classical traction through the linear elastic law, so it should be regarded as a natural, not essential, boundary condition.**\nWhile prescribing $u_x$ is equivalent to prescribing the classical stress $\\sigma = E u_x$, it is fundamentally a kinematic constraint. In the variational framework, boundary conditions on the kinematic fields ($u$ and $u_x$) are essential, whereas conditions on their conjugate forces ($P$ and $M$) are natural. This option incorrectly classifies the boundary condition type. A natural boundary condition would involve specifying $P$ or $M$, which depend on higher derivatives ($u_{xx}$ and $u_{xxx}$) that are not fixed by simply setting $u_x$.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2688451"}, {"introduction": "A clear understanding of the required boundary data is not merely an academic formality; it is critical for ensuring that a problem is well-posed and yields a unique, physically meaningful solution.

The roots are $r=0$ (with multiplicity $2$), $r = \\frac{1}{\\ell}$, and $r = -\\frac{1}{\\ell}$.\nThe general solution for the displacement $u(x)$ is therefore:\n$$\nu(x) = C_1 + C_2 x + C_3 \\exp(x/\\ell) + C_4 \\exp(-x/\\ell)\n$$\nThis can be expressed more conveniently using hyperbolic functions:\n$$\nu(x) = A_1 + A_2 x + A_3 \\cosh(x/\\ell) + A_4 \\sinh(x/\\ell)\n$$\nNow we must impose the boundary conditions $t(0)=0$ and $t(L)=0$. The traction $t$ is given by $t(x) = E(u' - \\ell^2 u''')$. Let us compute the first and third derivatives of $u(x)$:\n$$\nu'(x) = A_2 + \\frac{A_3}{\\ell} \\sinh(x/\\ell) + \\frac{A_4}{\\ell} \\cosh(x/\\ell)\n$$\n$$\nu'''(x) = \\frac{A_3}{\\ell^3} \\sinh(x/\\ell) + \\frac{A_4}{\\ell^3} \\cosh(x/\\ell)\n$$\nSubstituting these into the expression for $t(x)$:\n$$\nt(x) = E \\left[ \\left( A_2 + \\frac{A_3}{\\ell} \\sinh(x/\\ell) + \\frac{A_4}{\\ell} \\cosh(x/\\ell) \\right) - \\ell^2 \\left( \\frac{A_3}{\\ell^3} \\sinh(x/\\ell) + \\frac{A_4}{\\ell^3} \\cosh(x/\\ell) \\right) \\right]\n$$\nThe terms involving hyperbolic functions cancel out:\n$$\nt(x) = E A_2\n$$\nThis reveals that the classical traction $t$ is constant throughout the entire bar. This is a direct consequence of the equilibrium equation, which can be integrated once to give $u''' - \\frac{1}{\\ell^2} u' = \\text{constant}$, which implies $t(x) = -E\\ell^2 \\times \\text{constant}$.\nThe boundary conditions $t(0)=0$ and $t(L)=0$ both lead to the same equation: $E A_2 = 0$. Since the Young's modulus $E$ is non-zero, this requires $A_2=0$.\nThe two prescribed boundary conditions are not independent; they collapse into a single algebraic constraint on the constants of integration.\nThe general solution has four arbitrary constants ($A_1, A_2, A_3, A_4$). The two (nominally) traction boundary conditions provide only one independent constraint ($A_2=0$). Therefore, $4 - 1 = 3$ constants remain undetermined.\nThe family of solutions that satisfy the given conditions is:\n$$\nu(x) = A_1 + A_3 \\cosh(x/\\ell) + A_4 \\sinh(x/\\ell)\n$$\nThis is a three-parameter family of functions, spanned by the basis functions $\\{1, \\cosh(x/\\ell), \\sinh(x/\\ell)\\}$. The dimension of this family of solutions is $3$.\n\nPart 3: Amending the boundary conditions for a well-posed problem.\nThe boundary value problem as specified in part 2) is ill-posed because it is under-determined. A fourth-order differential equation requires four independent boundary conditions for a unique solution (up to rigid-body modes). The provided specification $t(0)=t(L)=0$ only supplies one condition.\nTo formulate a well-posed problem, one must prescribe a total of four independent boundary conditions. In this higher-order theory, at each boundary point ($x=0$ and $x=L$), there are two power-conjugate pairs of variables: $(t, u)$ and $(m, u')$. A well-posed boundary value problem is formed by specifying exactly one variable from each pair at each boundary. This means for $x=0$, one must specify either $t(0)$ or $u(0)$, AND either $m(0)$ or $u'(0)$. A similar choice must be made at $x=L$.\nFor example, to model a bar clamped at $x=0$ and free at $x=L$, one would impose the following four independent boundary conditions, which ensure a unique solution:\n1.  At $x=0$, specified essential (kinematic) conditions: $u(0) = 0$ (no displacement).\n2.  At $x=0$, specified essential (kinematic) conditions: $u'(0) = 0$ (no rotation).\n3.  At $x=L$, specified natural (traction) conditions: $t(L) = 0$ (no classical traction).\n4.  At $x=L$, specified natural (traction) conditions: $m(L) = 0$ (no higher-order traction).\nThis set of four conditions is sufficient to uniquely determine the four constants $A_1, A_2, A_3, A_4$ in the general solution, thus yielding a unique displacement field. For the case of no external loading, as is the case here, this set of conditions yields the unique trivial solution $u(x)=0$.\n\nThe question asks for the dimension found in part 2.

I will therefore proceed with a complete solution.\n\nThe solution is derived by applying the principle of virtual work, which states that the variation of the internal stored energy, $\\delta\\mathcal{U}$, is equal to the virtual work done by external forces, $\\delta\\mathcal{W}_{\\text{ext}}$.\n\nThe total internal stored energy $\\mathcal{U}$ is the integral of the energy density $W$ over the length of the bar:\n$$\n\\mathcal{U} \\;=\\; \\int_{0}^{L} W(\\epsilon, \\epsilon') \\,dx \\;=\\; \\int_{0}^{L} \\left( \\tfrac{1}{2}\\,E\\,\\epsilon^{2} \\;+\\; \\tfrac{1}{2}\\,E\\,\\ell^{2}\\,(\\epsilon')^{2} \\right) dx\n$$\nThe first variation of the total stored energy, which defines the internal virtual work $\\delta\\mathcal{W}_{\\text{int}} = \\delta\\mathcal{U}$, is:\n$$\n\\delta\\mathcal{U} \\;=\\; \\int_{0}^{L} \\delta W(\\epsilon, \\epsilon') \\,dx \\;=\\; \\int_{0}^{L} \\left( \\frac{\\partial W}{\\partial \\epsilon} \\delta\\epsilon \\;+\\; \\frac{\\partial W}{\\partial \\epsilon'} \\delta\\epsilon' \\right) dx\n$$\n\n**1) Identification of Stress Measures and Boundary Terms**\n\nFrom the expression for $\\delta\\mathcal{U}$, we identify the work-conjugate stress measures to the strain $\\epsilon$ and the strain gradient $\\epsilon'$.\nThe classical stress, $\\sigma$, is the work-conjugate to the strain, $\\epsilon$:\n$$\n\\sigma(x) \\;=\\; \\frac{\\partial W}{\\partial \\epsilon} \\;=\\; E\\,\\epsilon(x)\n$$\nThe higher-order stress (also known as a double stress or moment stress), $\\mu$, is the work-conjugate to the strain gradient, $\\epsilon'$:\n$$\n\\mu(x) \\;=\\; \\frac{\\partial W}{\\partial \\epsilon'} \\;=\\; E\\,\\ell^{2}\\,\\epsilon'(x)\n$$\nTo derive the boundary terms, we express the variations of the kinematic variables, $\\delta\\epsilon$ and $\\delta\\epsilon'$, in terms of the variation of the displacement field, $\\delta u$. Since $\\epsilon = u'$ and $\\epsilon' = u''$, we have $\\delta\\epsilon = (\\delta u)'$ and $\\delta\\epsilon' = (\\delta u)''$. The internal virtual work becomes:\n$$\n\\delta\\mathcal{U} \\;=\\; \\int_{0}^{L} \\left( \\sigma (\\delta u)' \\;+\\; \\mu (\\delta u)'' \\right) dx\n$$\nWe apply integration by parts to move the derivatives from the virtual displacement $\\delta u$ to the stress measures.\nThe first term yields: $\\int_{0}^{L} \\sigma (\\delta u)' \\,dx = [\\sigma \\delta u]_{0}^{L} - \\int_{0}^{L} \\sigma' \\delta u \\,dx$.\nThe second term is integrated by parts twice: $\\int_{0}^{L} \\mu (\\delta u)'' \\,dx = [\\mu (\\delta u)']_{0}^{L} - \\int_{0}^{L} \\mu' (\\delta u)' \\,dx = [\\mu (\\delta u)']_{0}^{L} - [\\mu' \\delta u]_{0}^{L} + \\int_{0}^{L} \\mu'' \\delta u \\,dx$.\nCombining these results gives the full expression for the internal virtual work:\n$$\n\\delta\\mathcal{U} \\;=\\; \\int_{0}^{L} (-\\sigma' + \\mu'') \\delta u \\,dx \\;+\\; [(\\sigma - \\mu')\\delta u]_{0}^{L} \\;+\\; [\\mu (\\delta u)']_{0}^{L}\n$$\nThe term $(-\\sigma' + \\mu'')\\delta u$ represents the virtual work of internal body forces. The boundary terms are $[(\\sigma - \\mu')\\delta u]_{0}^{L}$ and $[\\mu (\\delta u)']_{0}^{L}$. These terms are work-conjugate to the virtual displacement $\\delta u$ and the virtual strain $\\delta\\epsilon = (\\delta u)'$ at the boundaries, respectively.\n\n**2) Computation of Stress Measures for the Prescribed Displacement**\n\nA kinematic state $u(x) = u_{0}\\,\\sin(\\frac{\\pi x}{L})$ is prescribed.

Comparing this to the boundary terms of the internal virtual work, $\\delta\\mathcal{U}$, we identify the expressions for the tractions:\nClassical traction: $t(x) = \\sigma(x) - \\mu'(x)$\nHigher-order traction: $q(x) = \\mu(x)$\n\nTo compute $t(x)$, we first need the derivative of the higher-order stress, $\\mu'(x)$:\n$$\n\\mu'(x) \\;=\\; \\frac{d\\mu}{dx} \\;=\\; -E\\,\\ell^{2}\\,u_{0} \\left(\\frac{\\pi}{L}\\right)^{3} \\cos\\!\\left(\\frac{\\pi x}{L}\\right)\n$$\nNow we can write the expression for the classical traction $t(x)$:\n$$\nt(x) \\;=\\; E\\,u_{0}\\,\\frac{\\pi}{L}\\,\\cos\\!\\left(\\frac{\\pi x}{L}\\right) - \\left(-E\\,\\ell^{2}\\,u_{0} \\left(\\frac{\\pi}{L}\\right)^{3} \\cos\\!\\left(\\frac{\\pi x}{L}\\right)\\right)\n$$\n$$\nt(x) \\;=\\; E\\,u_{0}\\,\\frac{\\pi}{L} \\left( 1 + \\ell^{2} \\left(\\frac{\\pi}{L}\\right)^{2} \\right) \\cos\\!\\left(\\frac{\\pi x}{L}\\right)\n$$\nThe higher-order traction $q(x)$ is simply $\\mu(x)$:\n$$\nq(x) \\;=\\; -E\\,\\ell^{2}\\,u_{0} \\left(\\frac{\\pi}{L}\\right)^{2} \\sin\\!\\left(\\frac{\\pi x}{L}\\right)\n$$\nFinally, we evaluate these tractions at the boundary $x=L$:\nFor the classical traction $t(L)$:\n$$\nt(L) \\;=\\; E\\,u_{0}\\,\\frac{\\pi}{L} \\left( 1 + \\ell^{2} \\left(\\frac{\\pi}{L}\\right)^{2} \\right) \\cos\\!\\left(\\frac{\\pi L}{L}\\right) \\;=\\; E\\,u_{0}\\,\\frac{\\pi}{L} \\left( 1 + \\ell^{2} \\left(\\frac{\\pi}{L}\\right)^{2} \\right) \\cos(\\pi)\n$$\nSince $\\cos(\\pi) = -1$, we have:\n$$\nt(L) \\;=\\; -E\\,u_{0}\\,\\frac{\\pi}{L} \\left( 1 + \\ell^{2} \\left(\\frac{\\pi}{L}\\right)^{2} \\right)\n$$\nFor the higher-order traction $q(L)$:\n$$\nq(L) \\;=\\; -E\\,\\ell^{2}\\,u_{0} \\left(\\frac{\\pi}{L}\\right)^{2} \\sin\\!\\left(\\frac{\\pi L}{L}\\right) \\;=\\; -E\\,\\ell^{2}\\,u_{0} \\left(\\frac{\\pi}{L}\\right)^{2} \\sin(\\pi)\n$$\nSince $\\sin(\\pi) = 0$, we have:\n$$\nq(L) \\;=\\; 0\n$$\n\n**4) Commentary on Boundary Implications**\n\nThe prescribed displacement field $u(x) = u_{0}\\,\\sin(\\frac{\\pi x}{L})$ implies that the displacement is zero at both ends of the bar: $u(0)=0$ and $u(L)=0$. Such a condition corresponds to a bar with kinematically fixed ends.\nOur calculation shows that to maintain this specific deformation state, a non-zero classical traction $t(L) = -E\\,u_{0}\\,\\frac{\\pi}{L} (1 + (\\frac{\\pi \\ell}{L})^{2})$ must be applied at the boundary $x=L$. This force is necessary to enforce the zero-displacement condition while accommodating the non-zero strain at the boundary, $\\epsilon(L) = -u_{0}\\frac{\\pi}{L}$.\nConversely, the higher-order traction at the boundary is zero, $q(L)=0$. In strain gradient elasticity, the boundary condition $q=0$ is analogous to a \"moment-free\" or \"strain-free\" condition. It implies that no higher-order generalized force is needed to sustain the strain gradient at the boundary. The sinusoidal displacement profile is such that the strain gradient $\\epsilon'$ is naturally zero at $x=0$ and $x=L$. Since the higher-order stress $\\mu$ is directly proportional to $\\epsilon'$, $\\mu$ is also zero at the boundaries. As $q = \\mu$, the higher-order traction is consequently zero. Therefore, this imposed displacement field is consistent with a set of boundary conditions where displacement is prescribed ($u=0$) and the higher-order traction is zero ($q=0$), analogous to a simply supported beam in classical beam theory.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n-E u_{0} \\frac{\\pi}{L} \\left( 1 + \\ell^{2} \\left( \\frac{\\pi}{L} \\right)^{2} \\right) & 0\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "2688443"}]}
