Derivation of the Biot coefficient $\\alpha$.\n\nThe Biot coefficient $\\alpha$ is derived by comparing the material's response in two idealized hydrostatic loading scenarios.\na) **Drained Test:** A tensile stress $\\sigma$ is applied, while the pore fluid is free to escape, maintaining zero pore pressure ($p=0$). The effective stress is $\\sigma' = \\sigma + \\alpha(0) = \\sigma$. The skeleton's volumetric strain is given by the drained bulk modulus $K_b$: $\\epsilon = \\sigma' / K_b = \\sigma / K_b$.\nb) **Unjacketed Test:** The sample is subjected to a uniform fluid pressure $p$. This corresponds to a compressive total stress $\\sigma = -p$. The pore pressure is also $p$. The effective stress is $\\sigma' = \\sigma + \\alpha p = -p + \\alpha p = -p(1-\\alpha)$. The resulting volumetric strain is $\\epsilon = \\sigma' / K_b = -p(1-\\alpha) / K_b$.\n\nIn the unjacketed test, the solid grains are subjected to a uniform hydrostatic pressure $p$. The strain of the bulk material is therefore determined solely by the compressibility of the solid grains, whose bulk modulus is $K_s$. The strain due to the compressive stress $\\sigma = -p$ is $\\epsilon = \\sigma / K_s = -p / K_s$.\n\nEquating the two expressions for the strain $\\epsilon$ in the unjacketed test:\n$$\n\\frac{-p(1-\\alpha)}{K_b} = \\frac{-p}{K_s}\n$$\nCanceling $-p$ and rearranging for $\\alpha$ yields the classic result:\n$$\n1 - \\alpha = \\frac{K_b}{K_s} \\implies \\alpha = 1 - \\frac{K_b}{K_s}\n$$\nThis identity is consistent with the requirement $0 \\leq \\alpha \\leq 1$ and reduces to $\\alpha=1$ for a highly compliant frame $K_b \\ll K_s$ and to $\\alpha=0$ for a non-porous solid $K_b=K_s$.\n\n2.

A standard mixture-theoretic argument gives the change in fluid content per reference volume as:\n$$\n\\zeta = n\\,\\frac{p}{K_{f}} + ( \\alpha - n )\\,\\frac{p}{K_{s}}.\n$$\nThe first term $n\\,p/K_{f}$ is the contribution of fluid compressibility within the existing pore volume; the second term $(\\alpha - n)\\,p/K_{s}$ accounts for the solid grain compressibility that changes pore volume at fixed bulk volume.

With a finite modulus $M$, the storage equation does not degenerate into a kinematic constraint. All variables $p$, $\\zeta$, and $\\varepsilon_v$ are linked constitutively. There is no physical or mathematical basis to impose $\\zeta = 0$. The increment of fluid content $\\zeta$ can be non-zero, for instance, due to fluid being squeezed out of a deforming control volume. The verdict is **Incorrect**.\n\nE.

Darcy's law, which states that the fluid flux is proportional to the pressure gradient (among other factors), remains valid. Pressure gradients are the primary driver of fluid flow through the porous skeleton in many important problems, such as consolidation, even when the fluid is modeled as incompressible.
