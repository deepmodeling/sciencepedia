Measure the mechanical input impedance seen by the couple actuator and the resulting distributed internal fields. Conclude micropolar behavior if a nonzero compliance (or power intake) associated with the boundary microrotation rate is observed.**\nThis proposed experiment is precisely designed to exploit the key theoretical difference.\n- The boundary condition is a rigid clamp: $\\boldsymbol{u} = \\boldsymbol{0}$ and $\\boldsymbol{\\omega}_y = \\frac{1}{2}(\\partial u_x/\\partial z - \\partial u_z/\\partial x) = 0$ at the beam ends.\n- The applied load is a couple-traction $m_y$ about the axis normal to the cross-section. This load is work-conjugate to the microrotation component $\\phi_y$.\n- **Response in CCS theory:** Since $\\phi_y$ is constrained to be equal to $\\omega_y$, and $\\omega_y$ is kinematically fixed to zero at the boundary, $\\phi_y$ must also be zero at the boundary. Therefore, the applied couple-traction $m_y$ cannot induce a work-conjugate rotation rate $\\dot{\\phi}_y$. The power intake, given by $P = \\int_{\\text{end face}} m_y \\dot{\\phi}_y \\, dS$, must be zero. The system would exhibit infinite impedance to this specific loading.\n- **Response in MP theory:** The microrotation $\\phi_y$ is an independent degree of freedom. Even though $\\boldsymbol{u}=\\boldsymbol{0}$ and $\\boldsymbol{\\omega}_y=\\boldsymbol{0}$ at the boundary, $\\phi_y$ is free to vary. The applied couple-traction $m_y(t)$ can therefore excite a dynamic response in the independent $\\phi_y$ field. This will lead to a non-zero microrotation rate $\\dot{\\phi}_y$ at the boundary, a finite mechanical impedance, and a measurable power intake.\nThis experiment provides a qualitative, \"yes/no\" test for the independence of the microrotation field. A positive result (non-zero power intake) is incompatible with CCS theory but allowed by MP theory.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**D. Glue two identical beams along their lengths to form a composite of doubled thickness $2h$ and perform anti-symmetric four-point bending to impose a large strain gradient through the thickness. Conclude micropolar behavior if the composite beam is stiffer than predicted by classical bending theory.**\nThis is an experiment in bending that induces large strain gradients. The conclusion is drawn if the beam is stiffer than the classical prediction. As explained for option A, both micropolar and constrained couple-stress theories predict such stiffening in the presence of large strain gradients. Therefore, this experiment cannot be used to distinguish between them.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**E. Apply equal and opposite transverse shear forces at the midspan on the top and bottom faces to create a force couple per unit length with zero net transverse force, and measure the resulting deflection field. Conclude micropolar behavior if the shear compliance depends on $h$.**\nThis loading scenario generates a bending moment and associated strain gradients. The test seeks to measure a size-dependent compliance. This is, once again, a test for a size effect. Both higher-order theories predict that material response (stiffness, compliance) will depend on the ratio of a structural dimension ($h$) to an internal material length scale. This test is therefore not specific enough to single out the micropolar model.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2625813"}]}
