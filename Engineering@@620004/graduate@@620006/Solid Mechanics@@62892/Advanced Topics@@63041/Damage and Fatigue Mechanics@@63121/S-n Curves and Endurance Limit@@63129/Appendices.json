Consider a material whose S-N data, plotted as stress amplitude versus number of cycles on a base-$10$ logarithmic scale for both axes, is well represented by a straight line. The measured slope of this line is $-0.095$. \n\nUsing a power-law stress-life relation consistent with such empirical S-N behavior, do the following:\n- Starting from the power-law relation, derive the equation of the S-N line on a log-log plot and show how the slope $-b$ arises.\n- From this base, derive the logarithmic sensitivity of life to stress amplitude changes, in the form $d\\ln N/d\\ln \\sigma_{a}$, and explain how it depends on the slope magnitude.\n- For a finite change, derive an analytic expression for the ratio of lives at two different stress amplitudes in terms of the ratio of the amplitudes and the slope parameter.\n\nFinally, suppose the stress amplitude is reduced by a factor of $0.88$ relative to its original value, while the power-law slope parameter remains unchanged and equal to the magnitude of the measured slope. Compute the corresponding life ratio. Express the life ratio $N_{2}/N_{1}$ as a pure number and round your answer to three significant figures.", "solution": "The problem statement is subjected to validation and is found to be scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. It describes the empirical Basquin relation for high-cycle fatigue, a standard model in solid mechanics. All provided data and requirements are consistent and sufficient for a unique, meaningful solution. Thus, we proceed.\n\nThe relationship between stress amplitude, $\\sigma_a$, and the number of cycles to failure, $N$, in the high-cycle fatigue regime is described by a power law known as Basquin's equation. A common form of this relation is:\n$$ \\sigma_a = C N^{-b} $$\nHere, $C$ is the fatigue strength coefficient and $b$ is the fatigue strength exponent, both of which are material constants. The exponent $b$ is a positive number.\n\nThe first task is to derive the equation of the S-N line on a double-logarithmic plot and relate its slope to the parameter $b$. The problem specifies a base-$10$ logarithmic scale for both axes. We take the $\\log_{10}$ of both sides of Basquin's equation:\n$$ \\log_{10}(\\sigma_a) = \\log_{10}(C N^{-b}) $$\nUsing the properties of logarithms, we expand the right-hand side:\n$$ \\log_{10}(\\sigma_a) = \\log_{10}(C) + \\log_{10}(N^{-b}) $$\n$$ \\log_{10}(\\sigma_a) = \\log_{10}(C) - b \\log_{10}(N) $$\nThis equation is of the form $Y = mX + c$, where the vertical axis coordinate is $Y = \\log_{10}(\\sigma_a)$, the horizontal axis coordinate is $X = \\log_{10}(N)$, the slope is $m = -b$, and the y-intercept is $c = \\log_{10}(C)$. This demonstrates that the power-law relation yields a straight line on a log-log plot of $\\sigma_a$ versus $N$. The slope of this line is indeed $-b$. The problem states the measured slope is $-0.095$. Therefore, the parameter $b$ for this material is $0.095$.\n\nThe second task is to derive the logarithmic sensitivity of life to stress, defined as the derivative $d\\ln N / d\\ln \\sigma_a$. For this derivation, it is more convenient to use the natural logarithm ($\\ln$). We take the natural logarithm of Basquin's equation:\n$$ \\ln(\\sigma_a) = \\ln(C N^{-b}) $$\n$$ \\ln(\\sigma_a) = \\ln(C) - b \\ln(N) $$\nWe are interested in the derivative of $\\ln(N)$ with respect to $\\ln(\\sigma_a)$. We can differentiate the entire equation with respect to $\\ln(\\sigma_a)$:\n$$ \\frac{d}{d\\ln\\sigma_a} \\left( \\ln(\\sigma_a) \\right) = \\frac{d}{d\\ln\\sigma_a} \\left( \\ln(C) - b \\ln(N) \\right) $$\nSince $\\ln(C)$ is a constant, its derivative is zero. Applying the chain rule to the term with $\\ln(N)$:\n$$ 1 = 0 - b \\frac{d\\ln N}{d\\ln \\sigma_a} $$\nSolving for the desired sensitivity gives:\n$$ \\frac{d\\ln N}{d\\ln \\sigma_a} = -\\frac{1}{b} $$\nThis result shows that the logarithmic sensitivity of life to stress is the negative reciprocal of the fatigue strength exponent $b$. This means that a smaller value of $b$ (a shallower slope on the S-N curve) corresponds to a higher sensitivity of fatigue life to changes in stress amplitude. Conversely, a larger $b$ (a steeper slope) indicates that life is less sensitive to stress variations.\n\nThe third task is to derive an expression for the ratio of lives at two different stress amplitudes. Let two states on the S-N curve be $(\\sigma_{a,1}, N_1)$ and $(\\sigma_{a,2}, N_2)$. Both points must satisfy the power-law relation:\n$$ \\sigma_{a,1} = C N_1^{-b} \\quad (1) $$\n$$ \\sigma_{a,2} = C N_2^{-b} \\quad (2) $$\nTo eliminate the constant $C$, we divide equation $(2)$ by equation $(1)$:\n$$ \\frac{\\sigma_{a,2}}{\\sigma_{a,1}} = \\frac{C N_2^{-b}}{C N_1^{-b}} = \\left( \\frac{N_2}{N_1} \\right)^{-b} $$\nWe are required to find the life ratio $N_2/N_1$. We raise both sides of the equation to the power of $-1/b$:\n$$ \\left( \\frac{\\sigma_{a,2}}{\\sigma_{a,1}} \\right)^{-1/b} = \\left( \\left( \\frac{N_2}{N_1} \\right)^{-b} \\right)^{-1/b} $$\n$$ \\frac{N_2}{N_1} = \\left( \\frac{\\sigma_{a,2}}{\\sigma_{a,1}} \\right)^{-1/b} $$\nThis is the required analytic expression. An equivalent form is $\\frac{N_2}{N_1} = \\left( \\frac{\\sigma_{a,1}}{\\sigma_{a,2}} \\right)^{1/b}$.\n\nFinally, we must compute the life ratio $N_2/N_1$ for the given conditions. The stress amplitude is reduced by a factor of $0.88$, which means the ratio of the new stress amplitude to the original is $\\sigma_{a,2}/\\sigma_{a,1} = 0.88$. The power-law slope parameter $b$ is the magnitude of the measured slope, so $b = |-0.095| = 0.095$.\n\nSubstituting these values into the derived expression:\n$$ \\frac{N_2}{N_1} = (0.88)^{-1/0.095} $$\nThe exponent is calculated as $-1 / 0.095 \\approx -10.5263$.\n$$ \\frac{N_2}{N_1} = (0.88)^{-10.5263...} \\approx 3.84053 $$\nRounding the result to three significant figures, we get $3.84$. This means that a $12\\%$ reduction in stress amplitude results in an increase in fatigue life by a factor of approximately $3.84$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{3.84}$$", "id": "2682666"}, {"introduction": "While the Basquin relation is foundational, most engineering components operate under loads with a non-zero mean stress, which significantly affects fatigue life.

Start at $\\sigma_a=300\\,\\text{MPa}$. Use step $d=2\\,\\text{MPa}$ (equal to the load resolution) to maximize resolution. Stop after $n=15$ specimens regardless of reversals. Estimate $\\mu$ as the arithmetic mean of all tested $\\sigma_a$ values, and $\\sigma$ as the sample standard deviation of the tested $\\sigma_a$ values, ignoring failure/runout outcomes.\n\nC. Start at $\\sigma_a=320\\,\\text{MPa}$. Use step $d=40\\,\\text{MPa}$ (greater than twice the anticipated $\\sigma$) to ensure frequent reversals. Stop after the first $6$ reversals. Estimate $\\mu$ as the mean of the stress amplitudes at the reversal points plus a continuity correction of $d/2$, and estimate $\\sigma$ as $d/\\sqrt{2}$, independent of the observed sequence.\n\nD. Start at $\\sigma_a=330\\,\\text{MPa}$. Use step $d=18\\,\\text{MPa}$ (equal to the anticipated $\\sigma$). Stop when $R \\ge 10$ reversals and $n \\ge 12$ specimens have been tested.

This is a standard and widely used procedure in fatigue testing, formally known as a quantal response experiment.\n\n- **Scientifically Grounded:** The entire premise is sound. The staircase method is a well-established technique for estimating the $50\\%$ point (the mean, $\\mu$) of a psychometric or dose-response function. The use of a normal distribution to model the scatter in fatigue strength is a common and accepted assumption, leading to the specified probit model $p(\\sigma_a)=\\Phi((\\sigma_a-\\mu)/\\sigma)$. The defined terms ($R=-1$, runout, stress amplitude) are standard in fatigue analysis. The provided numerical values for $\\mu$ and $\\sigma$ are realistic for a medium-carbon steel.\n- **Well-Posed:** The problem is well-posed. It asks to select the most statistically and practically sound design from a set of options, based on provided information and constraints. The criteria for a good design (start level, step size, stopping rule, estimation method) are clear and relevant to the efficiency and accuracy of the experiment.\n- **Objective:** The language is precise and technical. It relies on established statistical and mechanical principles. There are no subjective or ambiguous statements in the core problem statement.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem statement is scientifically sound, well-posed, and contains sufficient information to be solved. There are no factual errors, contradictions, or unrealistic assumptions. The problem is a valid exercise in statistical experimental design applied to materials engineering.\n\n### Solution Derivation and Option Evaluation\n\nThe task is to evaluate four proposed experimental designs for a staircase fatigue test. The optimal design will efficiently use the limited number of specimens to estimate the mean fatigue strength $\\mu$ with the highest possible precision, adhering to the specified statistical model and practical constraints.\n\nThe key design parameters are:\n1.  **Starting Level ($\\sigma_{a,1}$):** Should be near the expected mean, $\\mu \\approx 300\\,\\text{MPa}$, to avoid wasting specimens in the initial phase of the test.\n2.  **Step Size ($d$):** The choice of $d$ relative to $\\sigma$ is critical. For efficient estimation of $\\mu$, a common recommendation is $d \\approx \\sigma$. If using Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE), a range of $d \\in [0.5\\sigma, 2\\sigma]$ is often considered acceptable, with smaller steps providing more information about the shape of the distribution if the model is correct.\n3.  **Stopping Rule:** Must ensure sufficient data is collected for a reliable estimate. This typically involves a minimum number of total tests, $n$, and/or a minimum number of reversals (a change in the direction of the staircase, e.g., runout followed by failure).\n4.  **Estimation Method:** Must be statistically valid. Given the explicit probit model $p(\\sigma_a)=\\Phi((\\sigma_a-\\mu)/\\sigma)$, the most powerful and theoretically correct method is Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE).\n\n**Evaluation of Option A:**\n- **Start Level:** $\\sigma_a=300\\,\\text{MPa}$. This is the prior estimate for $\\mu$, which is the optimal choice to start the test near the region of interest.\n- **Step Size:** $d=10\\,\\text{MPa}$. Given $\\sigma \\approx 18\\,\\text{MPa}$, the ratio is $d/\\sigma \\approx 10/18 \\approx 0.56$. This value is within the recommended range for efficient staircase testing, especially when MLE is used. It is also a multiple of the $2\\,\\text{MPa}$ resolution, making it practical.\n- **Stopping Rule:** Stop when reversals $R \\ge 15$ and specimens $n \\ge 25$, or if the precision target is met earlier. This is a very strong and robust rule. It ensures the test has adequately explored the region around $\\mu$ (high number of reversals) and a sufficient sample size is collected. The adaptive component (stopping if precision is met) makes the design efficient, avoiding unnecessary tests. The total specimen count is well within the budget of $36$.\n- **Estimation Method:** MLE under the correct probit model $p(\\sigma_a)=\\Phi\\!\\left((\\sigma_a-\\mu)/\\sigma\\right)$. This is the most statistically efficient method, as it uses all data points and is based on the explicitly stated underlying distribution. Confidence intervals from Fisher information or bootstrapping are the standard, correct procedures for assessing precision.\n- **Verdict:** **Correct**. This option describes a textbook example of a well-designed, modern, and statistically rigorous staircase experiment.\n\n**Evaluation of Option B:**\n- **Start Level:** $\\sigma_a=300\\,\\text{MPa}$. Correct.\n- **Step Size:** $d=2\\,\\text{MPa}$. This step size is too small, with $d/\\sigma \\approx 2/18 \\approx 0.11$. It will lead to very long sequences of identical outcomes, making the staircase walk inefficient and slow to collect information about the center of the distribution.\n- **Stopping Rule:** Stop after $n=15$ specimens. This is a small sample size, and ignoring the number of reversals is a serious flaw. The test could terminate before the mean is even bracketed.\n- **Estimation Method:** \"Estimate $\\mu$ as the arithmetic mean of all tested $\\sigma_a$ values... ignoring failure/runout outcomes.\" This is fundamentally incorrect. The sequence of test levels in a staircase procedure is not a random sample; it is a correlated series where each level depends on the previous outcome. Ignoring the outcomes discards the essential information and renders the calculation of a simple arithmetic mean meaningless and biased.\n- **Verdict:** **Incorrect**. This design is flawed in its step size, stopping rule, and most critically, its invalid estimation procedure.\n\n**Evaluation of Option C:**\n- **Start Level:** $\\sigma_a=320\\,\\text{MPa}$. This is about $1.1\\sigma$ above the expected mean, which is an inefficient starting point.\n- **Step Size:** $d=40\\,\\text{MPa}$. This step size is too large, with $d/\\sigma \\approx 40/18 \\approx 2.22$. The test will frequently jump from a level with near-zero failure probability to one with near-100% failure probability, yielding very little information about the slope of the probability curve around $\\mu$.\n- **Stopping Rule:** Stop after $6$ reversals. This is an insufficient amount of data for a precise estimate.\n- **Estimation Method:** The proposed estimation formulas for $\\mu$ and $\\sigma$ are not standard and appear to be incorrect or misapplied versions of approximations related to the much simpler Dixon-Mood method. For example, the estimate $\\sigma = d/\\sqrt{2}$ is not a generally valid formula for this context.\n- **Verdict:** **Incorrect**. This design is poor due to a suboptimal start level, a grossly inefficient step size, a weak stopping rule, and a questionable estimation method.\n\n**Evaluation of Option D:**\n- **Start Level:** $\\sigma_a=330\\,\\text{MPa}$. This is about $1.67\\sigma$ above the mean, a poor and wasteful starting point.\n- **Step Size:** $d=18\\,\\text{MPa}$. This gives $d/\\sigma \\approx 1$, which is a very good choice, often considered optimal for simpler estimators of $\\mu$.\n- **Stopping Rule:** Stop when $R \\ge 10$ and $n \\ge 12$. This is a very small sample size and will likely lead to a low-precision estimate, failing to meet the $5\\,\\text{MPa}$ half-width target.\n- **Estimation Method:** Uses logistic regression. The problem statement explicitly defines the failure probability using the standard normal CDF (a probit model). Using a logistic CDF (a logit model) constitutes a model misspecification. While the logistic and normal CDFs are similar, it is scientifically rigorous to use the model that is known to describe the process. Using the wrong model is a fundamental error.\n- **Verdict:** **Incorrect**. Despite a good choice of step size, this option is flawed due to its poor starting point, weak stopping rule, and, most importantly, its use of an incorrect statistical model for estimation.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nOption A is the only one that proposes a statistically and practically sound design. It correctly specifies all components of the experimental plan: an optimal starting level, a reasonable step size, a robust and efficient stopping rule, and the most powerful and appropriate estimation method (MLE based on the correct probit model).", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2682705"}]}
