It is a well-posed problem in dimensional analysis, grounded in the established empirical framework of fatigue crack growth in solid mechanics. It is free of scientific absurdities, contradictions, and ambiguities. We shall proceed with the derivation.\n\nThe empirical relationship provided, known as the Paris-Erdogan law, describes Stage II fatigue crack growth. It is given by the differential equation:\n$$\n\\frac{da}{dN} = C (\\Delta K)^m\n$$\nHere, $a$ is the crack length, $N$ is the number of load cycles, $\\Delta K$ is the stress intensity factor range, and $C$ and $m$ are material-dependent parameters. Our objective is to determine the fundamental dimensions of the constant $C$.\n\nThe principle of dimensional homogeneity dictates that all terms in a physical equation must have the same dimensions. We will analyze the dimensions of each term in the equation using the SI base dimensions of mass ($M$), length ($L$), and time ($T$).\n\nFirst, we consider the term on the left-hand side, the crack growth rate per cycle, $\\frac{da}{dN}$.\nThe crack length, $a$, has the dimension of length, so its dimension is $[a] = L$.\nThe number of cycles, $N$, is a dimensionless count, so its dimension is $[N] = 1$.\nTherefore, the dimension of the crack growth rate is:\n$$\n\\left[\\frac{da}{dN}\\right] = \\frac{[a]}{[N]} = \\frac{L}{1} = L\n$$\n\nNext, we analyze the right-hand side, $C (\\Delta K)^m$. We must first determine the dimensions of the stress intensity factor range, $\\Delta K$.\nThe problem states that the stress intensity factor has the dimension of stress times the square root of length.\nStress, $\\sigma$, is defined as force per unit area. Force, from Newton's second law, has dimensions of mass times acceleration.\nThe dimension of force is $[\\text{Force}] = [\\text{mass}] \\times [\\text{acceleration}] = M \\cdot (L T^{-2}) = M L T^{-2}$.\nThe dimension of area is $[\\text{Area}] = L^2$.\nThus, the dimension of stress is:\n$$\n[\\sigma] = \\frac{[\\text{Force}]}{[\\text{Area}]} = \\frac{M L T^{-2}}{L^2} = M L^{-1} T^{-2}\n$$\nThe dimension of the stress intensity factor, $\\Delta K$, is then:\n$$\n[\\Delta K] = [\\sigma] \\times [\\sqrt{\\text{length}}] = (M L^{-1} T^{-2}) \\cdot (L^{1/2}) = M L^{-1/2} T^{-2}\n$$\nNow we can determine the dimension of the term $(\\Delta K)^m$:\n$$\n[(\\Delta K)^m] = (M L^{-1/2} T^{-2})^m = M^m L^{-m/2} T^{-2m}\n$$\n\nAccording to the principle of dimensional homogeneity, the dimensions of the left-hand side and right-hand side must be equal:\n$$\n\\left[\\frac{da}{dN}\\right] = [C (\\Delta K)^m] = [C] [(\\Delta K)^m]\n$$\nSubstituting the derived dimensions:\n$$\nL = [C] \\cdot (M^m L^{-m/2} T^{-2m})\n$$\nWe solve this equation for the dimensions of the constant $C$:\n$$\n[C] = \\frac{L}{M^m L^{-m/2} T^{-2m}}\n$$\nBy applying the rules of exponents, we find the fundamental SI base dimensions of $C$:\n$$\n[C] = M^{-m} L^{1 - (-m/2)} T^{-(-2m)} = M^{-m} L^{1 + m/2} T^{2m}\n$$\nThis expression provides the SI base-dimension exponents of $C$ as a function of the Paris exponent $m$.\n\nThe problem also requires an explanation of how the practical units of $C$ depend on $m$. Let the units of $a$ be meters (symbol $\\text{m}$) and the units of $\\Delta K$ be megapascal-root-meter ($\\text{MPa}\\sqrt{\\text{m}}$). From the Paris equation:\n$$\n\\text{units}[C] = \\frac{\\text{units}\\left[\\frac{da}{dN}\\right]}{\\text{units}[(\\Delta K)^m]}\n$$\nThe units of $\\frac{da}{dN}$ are $\\frac{\\text{m}}{\\text{cycle}}$, which we treat as $\\text{m}$ since `cycle` is dimensionless. The units of $(\\Delta K)^m$ are $(\\text{MPa}\\sqrt{\\text{m}})^m$. Therefore, the practical units of $C$ are:\n$$\n\\text{units}[C] = \\frac{\\text{m}}{(\\text{MPa}\\sqrt{\\text{m}})^m} = \\frac{\\text{m}}{(\\text{MPa})^m (\\text{m}^{1/2})^m} = \\text{m}^{1 - m/2} \\cdot \\text{MPa}^{-m}\n$$\nAs is evident, the units of the \"constant\" $C$ are themselves dependent on the exponent $m$.\n\nThe physical reason for this dependence is that the Paris law is a phenomenological, empirical model, not a law derived from fundamental principles. It is a power-law fit to experimental data. The quantity $\\Delta K$ is dimensional. Whenever a dimensional quantity is raised to a variable exponent ($m$) in an empirical fit, the proportionality constant ($C$) must necessarily possess dimensions that depend on that exponent to ensure the equation remains dimensionally consistent. The constant $C$ is thus not a simple constant of proportionality; it is a dimensional scaling parameter whose role is to rectify the dimensions of the equation for a given material's empirically determined $m$. For different materials with different $m$ values, the physical units of the reported $C$ values are different, which is a notorious point of confusion and requires careful attention when comparing material data.\n\nThe final answer required is the expression for the SI base dimensions of $C$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{M^{-m} L^{1 + \\frac{m}{2}} T^{2m}}\n$$"}, {"introduction": "With a firm grasp of the Paris law's structure, we can now use it to make quantitative predictions about a component's fatigue life.

To find the total number of cycles, $N(a_i \\to a_f)$, required to grow the crack from $a_i$ to $a_f$, we must integrate this equation. We begin by separating the variables $a$ and $N$:\n$$ dN = \\frac{da}{C (\\Delta\\sigma)^m \\pi^{m/2} a^{m/2}} $$\nThis can be written as:\n$$ dN = \\frac{1}{C (\\Delta\\sigma)^m \\pi^{m/2}} a^{-m/2} da $$\nWe integrate both sides of the equation.

It is **valid**. A solution will be provided.\n\n**Solution Derivation**\nThe fundamental relationship between the crack growth rate, $da/dN$, and the number of load cycles, $N$, is given by separating variables from the differential form:\n$$ dN = \\frac{da}{da/dN} $$\nTo find the total number of cycles, $N$, required for a crack to grow from an initial length $a_i$ to a final length $a_f$, we must integrate this expression over the crack length interval:\n$$ N = \\int_{a_i}^{a_f} \\frac{1}{da/dN} \\, da $$\nThe rate of fatigue crack growth, $da/dN$, is governed by the Paris-Erdogan law, which relates the growth rate to the range of the stress intensity factor, $\\Delta K$:\n$$ \\frac{da}{dN} = C (\\Delta K)^m $$\nwhere $C$ and $m$ are empirical material constants.\n\nSubstituting the Paris law into the integral for $N$ yields:\n$$ N = \\int_{a_i}^{a_f} \\frac{1}{C (\\Delta K)^m} \\, da $$\nThe stress intensity factor range, $\\Delta K$, is a function of the applied stress range $\\Delta \\sigma$, the crack length $a$, and the geometry of the component. For the specified single-edge-cracked plate, it is given by:\n$$ \\Delta K(a) = Y(\\alpha) \\Delta \\sigma \\sqrt{\\pi a} $$\nwhere $\\alpha = a/W$ and $Y(\\alpha)$ is the dimensionless geometry correction factor, provided as a polynomial:\n$$ Y(\\alpha) = 1.12 - 0.231\\,\\alpha + 10.55\\,\\alpha^2 - 21.72\\,\\alpha^3 + 30.39\\,\\alpha^4 $$\nBy substituting the expression for $\\Delta K(a)$ into the integral for $N$, we obtain the complete integrand:\n$$ N = \\int_{a_i}^{a_f} \\frac{1}{C \\left( Y(a/W) \\Delta \\sigma \\sqrt{\\pi a} \\right)^m} \\, da $$\nThis can be rewritten to isolate the constant terms from the integral:\n$$ N = \\frac{1}{C (\\Delta \\sigma)^m (\\pi)^{m/2}} \\int_{a_i}^{a_f} \\frac{1}{\\left( Y(a/W) \\sqrt{a} \\right)^m} \\, da $$\nDue to the polynomial form of $Y(a/W)$, this integral does not have a general closed-form analytical solution. Therefore, as mandated by the problem, numerical quadrature is the correct and necessary method for its evaluation. We define the integrand function $f(a)$:\n$$ f(a) = \\frac{1}{C \\left( Y(a/W) \\Delta \\sigma \\sqrt{\\pi a} \\right)^m} $$\nThe number of cycles is then $N = \\int_{a_i}^{a_f} f(a) \\, da$. This definite integral will be computed for each test case using a robust numerical quadrature algorithm, ensuring consistent use of SI units for all physical quantities. The crack lengths $a$, $a_i$, $a_f$, and plate width $W$ are in meters ($m$). The stress range $\\Delta \\sigma$ is in megapascals ($MPa$). The Paris constant $C$ is in $\\text{m/cycle} \\cdot (\\text{MPa}\\sqrt{\\text{m}})^{-m}$. The resulting value for $N$ will be a dimensionless quantity representing the number of cycles.", "answer": "```python\n# The complete and runnable Python 3 code goes here.\n# Imports must adhere to the specified execution environment.\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy import integrate\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Computes the number of fatigue cycles for crack growth using numerical integration\n    of the Paris law.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Define the initial and final crack lengths in meters.\n    a_i = 1.0e-3  # m\n    a_f = 1.0e-2  # m\n\n    # Define the test cases from the problem statement.\n    # Each case is a tuple: (W_m, delta_sigma_MPa, C, m)\n    # W_m is the plate width in meters.\n    # delta_sigma_MPa is the stress range in MPa.\n    # C is the Paris law constant in m/cycle * (MPa*sqrt(m))^-m.\n    # m is the Paris law exponent (dimensionless).\n    test_cases = [\n        # Case 1: Happy path\n        (50.0e-3, 100.0, 1.0e-12, 3.0),\n        # Case 2: Reduced stress range\n        (50.0e-3, 50.0, 1.0e-12, 3.0),\n        # Case 3: Increased exponent\n        (50.0e-3, 100.0, 1.0e-12, 4.0),\n        # Case 4: Narrower plate\n        (25.0e-3, 100.0, 1.0e-12, 3.0),\n        # Case 5: Different material constants\n        (40.0e-3, 80.0, 5.0e-13, 3.2),\n    ]\n\n    results = []\n    \n    # Polynomial coefficients for the geometry function Y(alpha), where alpha = a/W.\n    # Y(alpha) = c0 + c1*alpha + c2*alpha^2 + c3*alpha^3 + c4*alpha^4\n    Y_coeffs = np.array([30.39, -21.72, 10.55, -0.231, 1.12])\n\n    def Y(alpha):\n        \"\"\"\n        Computes the geometry correction factor Y for a given alpha = a/W.\n        \"\"\"\n        return np.polyval(Y_coeffs, alpha)\n\n    for case in test_cases:\n        W_m, delta_sigma_MPa, C, m = case\n\n        def integrand(a):\n            \"\"\"\n            Defines the function 1 / (da/dN) to be integrated with respect to crack length 'a'.\n            All units must be consistent (SI/MPa based).\n            \n            Args:\n                a (float): Crack length in meters.\n\n            Returns:\n                float: The value of 1 / (da/dN) in units of cycles/m.\n            \"\"\"\n            # Calculate dimensionless crack length ratio\n            alpha = a / W_m\n\n            # Check if a/W is within the valid range for the geometry function Y.\n            # The problem statement guarantees this, but it is good practice.\n            if not (0 <= alpha <= 0.6):\n                # This should not be reached with the given test cases.\n                # Return infinity to signal an error if quad explores outside the domain.\n                return np.inf\n            \n            # Calculate geometry factor\n            Y_val = Y(alpha)\n            \n            # Calculate stress intensity factor range (MPa*sqrt(m))\n            delta_K = Y_val * delta_sigma_MPa * np.sqrt(np.pi * a)\n            \n            # Calculate crack growth rate (m/cycle) using Paris law\n            da_dN = C * (delta_K ** m)\n            \n            # The function to integrate is the reciprocal of the growth rate\n            return 1.0 / da_dN\n\n        # Perform numerical integration from a_i to a_f\n        # quad returns a tuple (result, error_estimate)\n        N_cycles, _ = integrate.quad(\n            integrand, \n            a_i, \n            a_f,\n            epsabs=1e-9, # Absolute tolerance for high accuracy\n            epsrel=1e-9  # Relative tolerance for high accuracy\n        )\n        \n        results.append(N_cycles)\n\n    # Final print statement must be in the exact required format.\n    # Each value is formatted to six decimal places.\n    print(f\"[{','.join(f'{r:.6f}' for r in results)}]\")\n\nsolve()\n```"}]}
