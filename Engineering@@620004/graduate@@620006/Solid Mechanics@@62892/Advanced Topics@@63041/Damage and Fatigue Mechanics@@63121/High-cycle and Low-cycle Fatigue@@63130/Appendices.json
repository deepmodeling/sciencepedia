The material behavior is idealized as elastic-perfectly plastic with kinematic hardening.\n\nThe total strain, $\\varepsilon$, is decomposed into its elastic, $\\varepsilon_{e}$, and plastic, $\\varepsilon_{p}$, components:\n$$\n\\varepsilon = \\varepsilon_{e} + \\varepsilon_{p}\n$$\nThe stress-strain relationship in the elastic regime is governed by Hooke's Law, $\\sigma = E\\varepsilon_{e}$.\n\nThe dissipated energy per cycle per unit volume, $W_{d}$, is defined as the area enclosed by the stabilized stress-strain ($\\sigma$-$\\varepsilon$) hysteresis loop:\n$$\nW_{d} = \\oint \\sigma\\,\\mathrm{d}\\varepsilon\n$$\nSubstituting the differential form of the strain decomposition, $\\mathrm{d}\\varepsilon = \\mathrm{d}\\varepsilon_{e} + \\mathrm{d}\\varepsilon_{p}$, into the expression for $W_{d}$:\n$$\nW_{d} = \\oint \\sigma\\,(\\mathrm{d}\\varepsilon_{e} + \\mathrm{d}\\varepsilon_{p}) = \\oint \\sigma\\,\\mathrm{d}\\varepsilon_{e} + \\oint \\sigma\\,\\mathrm{d}\\varepsilon_{p}\n$$\nThe first integral, $\\oint \\sigma\\,\\mathrm{d}\\varepsilon_{e}$, represents the work done on the elastic component of the material.

The loading is fully reversed total strain control with amplitude $\\varepsilon_{a}$. The material yields at a stress of magnitude $\\sigma_{y}$. Due to kinematic hardening in a stabilized cycle, yielding occurs at $\\sigma = \\sigma_{y}$ in tension and $\\sigma = -\\sigma_{y}$ in compression, giving a total elastic stress range of $2\\sigma_{y}$.\n\nThe hysteresis loop in the $\\sigma$-$\\varepsilon$ plane takes the shape of a parallelogram. Let us trace the four segments of the loop, starting from the point of maximum tensile strain $(\\varepsilon_{a}, \\sigma_{y})$:\n1.  **Elastic Unloading:** The specimen unloads elastically from $(\\varepsilon_{a}, \\sigma_{y})$. The stress decreases from $\\sigma_{y}$ to $-\\sigma_{y}$. The change in stress is $\\Delta\\sigma = -2\\sigma_{y}$. The corresponding elastic strain change is $\\Delta\\varepsilon_{e} = \\Delta\\sigma/E = -2\\sigma_{y}/E$.  During this segment, $\\mathrm{d}\\varepsilon_{p}=0$.\n2.  **Compressive Plastic Loading:** At $\\sigma = -\\sigma_{y}$, the material yields in compression. The stress remains constant at $-\\sigma_{y}$ while the total strain changes from its value at the start of compressive yield to $-\\varepsilon_{a}$.\n3.  **Elastic Reloading:** From $(-\\varepsilon_{a}, -\\sigma_{y})$, the material reloads elastically. The stress increases from $-\\sigma_{y}$ to $\\sigma_{y}$. The change in stress is $\\Delta\\sigma = 2\\sigma_{y}$, and the elastic strain change is $\\Delta\\varepsilon_{e} = 2\\sigma_{y}/E$. During this segment, $\\mathrm{d}\\varepsilon_{p}=0$.\n4.  **Tensile Plastic Loading:** At $\\sigma=\\sigma_{y}$, the material yields in tension. The stress remains constant at $\\sigma_{y}$ while the total strain changes until it returns to the starting point, $(\\varepsilon_{a}, \\sigma_{y})$.\n\nThe area of this parallelogram, $W_{d}$, can be calculated directly. The height of the parallelogram is the stress range, $\\Delta\\sigma = \\sigma_{y} - (-\\sigma_{y}) = 2\\sigma_{y}$. The width of the plastic straining portions is the plastic strain range, $\\Delta\\varepsilon_{p}$.\nThe total strain amplitude, $\\varepsilon_{a}$, is the sum of the elastic strain amplitude, $\\varepsilon_{e,a}$, and the plastic strain amplitude, $\\varepsilon_{p,a}$:\n$$\n\\varepsilon_{a} = \\varepsilon_{e,a} + \\varepsilon_{p,a}\n$$\nThe elastic strain amplitude corresponds to the change in elastic strain from zero stress to the yield stress, so $\\varepsilon_{e,a} = \\sigma_{y}/E$.\nThe plastic strain range is $\\Delta\\varepsilon_{p} = 2\\varepsilon_{p,a}$.\nThe area of the parallelogram-shaped hysteresis loop is calculated as the product of the stress range and the plastic strain range. This can be visualized as the area of the enclosing rectangle ($2\\sigma_{y} \\times 2\\varepsilon_{a}$) minus the area of the two elastic triangles at the ends, which is equivalent to the area of a rectangle of size $2\\sigma_{y} \\times 2\\varepsilon_{e,a}$.\nTherefore, $W_{d} = (2\\sigma_{y})(2\\varepsilon_{a}) - (2\\sigma_{y})(2\\varepsilon_{e,a}) = 4\\sigma_{y}(\\varepsilon_{a} - \\varepsilon_{e,a}) = 4\\sigma_{y}\\varepsilon_{p,a}$.\nThis confirms that the dissipated energy is proportional to the cyclic yield stress and the plastic strain amplitude.\n\nNow we compute the numerical value.\nGiven:\n$E = 210 \\times 10^{9}\\ \\text{Pa}$\n$\\sigma_{y} = 300 \\times 10^{6}\\ \\text{Pa}$\n$\\varepsilon_{a} = 0.007$\n\nFirst, calculate the elastic and plastic strain amplitudes:\nThe elastic strain amplitude is:\n$$\n\\varepsilon_{e,a} = \\frac{\\sigma_{y}}{E} = \\frac{300 \\times 10^{6}\\ \\text{Pa}}{210 \\times 10^{9}\\ \\text{Pa}} = \\frac{300}{210 \\times 10^{3}} = \\frac{1}{700}\n$$\nThe plastic strain amplitude is:\n$$\n\\varepsilon_{p,a} = \\varepsilon_{a} - \\varepsilon_{e,a} = 0.007 - \\frac{1}{700} = \\frac{7}{1000} - \\frac{1}{700} = \\frac{49 - 10}{7000} = \\frac{39}{7000}\n$$\nNow, calculate the dissipated energy per cycle, $W_{d}$:\n$$\nW_{d} = 4\\sigma_{y}\\varepsilon_{p,a} = 4 \\times (300 \\times 10^{6}\\ \\text{J/m}^{3}) \\times \\left(\\frac{39}{7000}\\right)\n$$\n$$\nW_{d} = \\frac{4 \\times 3 \\times 10^{8} \\times 39}{7 \\times 10^{3}} = \\frac{12 \\times 39}{7} \\times 10^{5} = \\frac{468}{7} \\times 10^{5}\\ \\text{J/m}^{3}\n$$\n$$\nW_{d} \\approx 66.85714 \\times 10^{5}\\ \\text{J/m}^{3} = 6.685714 \\times 10^{6}\\ \\text{J/m}^{3}\n$$\nThe problem requires the answer in units of kilojoules per cubic meter ($\\text{kJ}/\\text{m}^{3}$).

The Coffin-Manson relation, a cornerstone of LCF phenomenology, states that the number of cycles to failure, $N_{f}$, is inversely related to the plastic strain amplitude by a power law: $\\varepsilon_{p,a} \\cdot (N_{f})^{\\beta} = C$, where $\\beta$ and $C$ are material constants. A larger $\\varepsilon_{p,a}$ results in a significantly shorter fatigue life $N_{f}$.\nFurthermore, energy-based fatigue criteria, such as that proposed by Morrow, postulate that failure occurs when the total dissipated energy reaches a critical value, i.e., $N_{f} \\times W_{d} = W_{total}$.\nCombining these concepts, a larger plastic strain amplitude $\\varepsilon_{p,a}$ leads to a larger per-cycle dissipated energy $W_{d}$. This larger energy dissipation per cycle accelerates damage accumulation (e.g., microcrack nucleation and growth), which in turn leads to a lower number of cycles to failure, $N_{f}$. Therefore, $W_{d}$ serves as a direct indicator of the severity of cyclic plastic damage and is inversely correlated with fatigue life.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{6686}\n$$", "id": "2647164"}, {"introduction": "While low-cycle fatigue is often dominated by crack initiation, the life of components in the high-cycle regime is typically governed by crack propagation.
