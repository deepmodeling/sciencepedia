Starting from the core definitions for a bounded periodic scalar signal—namely, that the amplitude is one-half of the peak-to-peak range and that the mean is the arithmetic average of the extreme values—derive expressions for the stress amplitude $\\sigma_a$ and the mean stress $\\sigma_m$ in terms of $\\sigma_{\\max}$ and $\\sigma_{\\min}$, and use these to compute their numerical values for this cycle.

It is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and self-contained, presenting a standard exercise in the mechanical analysis of fatigue loading. All necessary data and definitions are provided, and no contradictions or ambiguities are present.

The problem defines the amplitude as one-half of the peak-to-peak range. The peak-to-peak range is the difference between the maximum and minimum values, which is $\\sigma_{\\max} - \\sigma_{\\min}$. Therefore, the stress amplitude $\\sigma_a$ is given by:\n$$\n\\sigma_a = \\frac{\\sigma_{\\max} - \\sigma_{\\min}}{2}\n$$\nThe problem defines the mean as the arithmetic average of the extreme values. Therefore, the mean stress $\\sigma_m$ is given by:\n$$\n\\sigma_m = \\frac{\\sigma_{\\max} + \\sigma_{\\min}}{2}\n$$\nUsing the provided numerical values, we compute $\\sigma_a$ and $\\sigma_m$:\n$$\n\\sigma_a = \\frac{457\\,\\text{MPa} - (-143\\,\\text{MPa})}{2} = \\frac{457\\,\\text{MPa} + 143\\,\\text{MPa}}{2} = \\frac{600\\,\\text{MPa}}{2} = 300\\,\\text{MPa}\n$$\n$$\n\\sigma_m = \\frac{457\\,\\text{MPa} + (-143\\,\\text{MPa})}{2} = \\frac{457\\,\\text{MPa} - 143\\,\\text{MPa}}{2} = \\frac{314\\,\\text{MPa}}{2} = 157\\,\\text{MPa}\n$$\nNext, we define the stress ratio $R$ as the ratio of the minimum to maximum stress, $R = \\sigma_{\\min} / \\sigma_{\\max}$. We compute its numerical value for the given cycle:\n$$\nR = \\frac{\\sigma_{\\min}}{\\sigma_{\\max}} = \\frac{-143}{457} \\approx -0.31291028...\n$$\nThe problem then requires an articulation of the necessary and sufficient conditions for a fully reversed loading cycle. A fully reversed cycle is one that is perfectly symmetric about a zero stress level. This fundamental definition leads to several equivalent mathematical conditions:\n1.  The mean stress must be zero: $\\sigma_m = 0$.\n2.  Substituting the definition of $\\sigma_m$, we get $\\frac{\\sigma_{\\max} + \\sigma_{\\min}}{2} = 0$, which implies $\\sigma_{\\max} + \\sigma_{\\min} = 0$, or $\\sigma_{\\max} = -\\sigma_{\\min}$. This means the maximum and minimum stresses must have equal magnitude and opposite sign.\n3.  From the definition of the stress ratio $R$, if $\\sigma_{\\max} = -\\sigma_{\\min}$ (and $\\sigma_{\\max} \\neq 0$), then $R = \\frac{\\sigma_{\\min}}{\\sigma_{\\max}} = \\frac{-\\sigma_{\\max}}{\\sigma_{\\max}} = -1$.\n4.

The amplitude equals the maximum stress.\n\nThese four conditions, $\\sigma_m = 0$, $\\sigma_{\\max} = -\\sigma_{\\min}$, $R = -1$, and $\\sigma_a = \\sigma_{\\max}$, are all necessary and sufficient for defining a fully reversed loading cycle.\n\nFinally, we must evaluate the verdict variable $F$, which is $1$ for a fully reversed cycle and $0$ otherwise. We check if the given cycle satisfies these conditions. We calculated $\\sigma_m = 157\\,\\text{MPa}$, which is not equal to $0$. Equivalently, $R \\approx -0.3129$, which is not equal to $-1$.

The evaluation metric is the root-mean-square of the logarithmic amplitude error, $\\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{RMS}}$.

This requires relating the mean stress $\\sigma_m$ to the alternating stress $\\sigma_a$ and the stress ratio $R$. From the fundamental definitions $\\sigma_{a} = (\\sigma_{\\max} - \\sigma_{\\min})/2$ and $\\sigma_{m} = (\\sigma_{\\max} + \\sigma_{\\min})/2$, we find $\\sigma_{\\max} = \\sigma_m + \\sigma_a$ and $\\sigma_{\\min} = \\sigma_m - \\sigma_a$.

This provides three sets of corrected data, each with $M=8$ points of the form $(\\sigma_{a,\\mathrm{eq}}, N)$.\n\nFinally, we compute the residual scatter for each model.
