This is valid.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is deemed **valid** as it is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. It represents a standard exercise in computational solid mechanics. The solution process will now proceed.\n\nThe derivation of the algorithmic tangent modulus, $C_{\\text{alg}}$, requires discretizing the evolution equations in time. We consider a typical time increment from a state at time $t_{n}$ to a state at time $t_{n+1}$. Let the total strain at $t_{n+1}$ be denoted by $\\varepsilon_{n+1}$. We use an implicit backward Euler integration scheme, which is standard for return-mapping algorithms.\n\nThe fundamental relations that must be satisfied at the end of the increment, at state $n+1$, are:\n1.  Strain decomposition: $\\varepsilon_{n+1} = \\varepsilon^{e}_{n+1} + \\varepsilon^{p}_{n+1}$.\n2.  Linear elastic law: $\\sigma_{n+1} = E \\varepsilon^{e}_{n+1}$.\n3.  Associative flow rule: For uniaxial tension, the yield function is $f = \\sigma - \\sigma_y$. The flow direction is $\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial \\sigma} = 1$. The discrete flow rule is $\\varepsilon^{p}_{n+1} - \\varepsilon^{p}_{n} = \\Delta \\varepsilon^{p} = \\Delta\\gamma \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial \\sigma} = \\Delta\\gamma$, where $\\Delta\\gamma \\ge 0$ is the plastic multiplier increment.\n4.  Hardening law: The yield stress evolves as $\\sigma_{y, n+1} = \\sigma_{y0} + H \\varepsilon^{p}_{n+1}$.\n5.  Consistency condition: Since plastic loading is active, the final state must lie on the updated yield surface, so $f_{n+1} = 0$. This gives $\\sigma_{n+1} - \\sigma_{y,n+1} = 0$.\n\nFrom the elastic law and strain decomposition, we express the stress as:\n$$ \\sigma_{n+1} = E (\\varepsilon_{n+1} - \\varepsilon^{p}_{n+1}) $$\nSubstituting the flow rule, $\\varepsilon^{p}_{n+1} = \\varepsilon^{p}_{n} + \\Delta\\gamma$:\n$$ \\sigma_{n+1} = E (\\varepsilon_{n+1} - \\varepsilon^{p}_{n} - \\Delta\\gamma) $$\nWe can identify the elastic trial stress, $\\sigma^{\\text{trial}} = E(\\varepsilon_{n+1} - \\varepsilon^{p}_{n})$, which is the stress that would be obtained if the entire strain increment were elastic. The equation becomes:\n$$ \\sigma_{n+1} = \\sigma^{\\text{trial}} - E \\Delta\\gamma $$\nThis is the \"return-mapping\" equation, geometrically returning the trial stress to the yield surface.\n\nNow, we use the consistency condition to find $\\Delta\\gamma$.\n$$ \\sigma_{n+1} - (\\sigma_{y0} + H \\varepsilon^{p}_{n+1}) = 0 $$\nSubstitute the expressions for $\\sigma_{n+1}$ and $\\varepsilon^{p}_{n+1}$:\n$$ (\\sigma^{\\text{trial}} - E \\Delta\\gamma) - (\\sigma_{y0} + H (\\varepsilon^{p}_{n} + \\Delta\\gamma)) = 0 $$\nWe gather terms to solve for $\\Delta\\gamma$:\n$$ \\sigma^{\\text{trial}} - \\sigma_{y0} - H \\varepsilon^{p}_{n} - E \\Delta\\gamma - H \\Delta\\gamma = 0 $$\nLet $\\sigma_{y,n} = \\sigma_{y0} + H \\varepsilon^{p}_{n}$ be the yield stress at the start of the increment. The equation simplifies to:\n$$ (\\sigma^{\\text{trial}} - \\sigma_{y,n}) - (E+H)\\Delta\\gamma = 0 $$\nThe term $(\\sigma^{\\text{trial}} - \\sigma_{y,n})$ is the value of the yield function evaluated at the trial state, $f^{\\text{trial}}$. Since plastic loading is active, $f^{\\text{trial}} > 0$. Solving for $\\Delta\\gamma$:\n$$ \\Delta\\gamma = \\frac{\\sigma^{\\text{trial}} - \\sigma_{y,n}}{E+H} $$\nNow we have an expression for the plastic multiplier. We can find the final stress $\\sigma_{n+1}$ in terms of the total strain $\\varepsilon_{n+1}$ and the state at $n$. Substitute $\\Delta\\gamma$ back into the stress equation $\\sigma_{n+1} = \\sigma^{\\text{trial}} - E \\Delta\\gamma$:\n$$ \\sigma_{n+1} = \\sigma^{\\text{trial}} - E \\left( \\frac{\\sigma^{\\text{trial}} - \\sigma_{y,n}}{E+H} \\right) $$\nTo simplify, we put everything over a common denominator:\n$$ \\sigma_{n+1} = \\frac{(E+H)\\sigma^{\\text{trial}} - E\\sigma^{\\text{trial}} + E\\sigma_{y,n}}{E+H} $$\n$$ \\sigma_{n+1} = \\frac{H\\sigma^{\\text{trial}} + E\\sigma_{y,n}}{E+H} $$\nThis expression gives the updated stress $\\sigma_{n+1}$ as a function of the trial stress $\\sigma^{\\text{trial}}$ and the yield stress from the previous step $\\sigma_{y,n}$.\n\nThe algorithmic tangent modulus is defined as the derivative of the updated stress $\\sigma_{n+1}$ with respect to the total strain $\\varepsilon_{n+1}$:\n$$ C_{\\text{alg}} = \\frac{d\\sigma_{n+1}}{d\\varepsilon_{n+1}} $$\nTo compute this derivative, we must recall how $\\sigma^{\\text{trial}}$ and $\\sigma_{y,n}$ depend on $\\varepsilon_{n+1}$.\n- The trial stress is $\\sigma^{\\text{trial}} = E(\\varepsilon_{n+1} - \\varepsilon^{p}_{n})$. Its derivative with respect to $\\varepsilon_{n+1}$ is $\\frac{d\\sigma^{\\text{trial}}}{d\\varepsilon_{n+1}} = E$.\n- The yield stress at the start of the step, $\\sigma_{y,n}$, depends only on the state at $t_n$ and is therefore constant with respect to $\\varepsilon_{n+1}$. So, $\\frac{d\\sigma_{y,n}}{d\\varepsilon_{n+1}} = 0$.\n\nNow we differentiate the expression for $\\sigma_{n+1}$:\n$$ C_{\\text{alg}} = \\frac{d}{d\\varepsilon_{n+1}} \\left( \\frac{H\\sigma^{\\text{trial}} + E\\sigma_{y,n}}{E+H} \\right) = \\frac{1}{E+H} \\left( H\\frac{d\\sigma^{\\text{trial}}}{d\\varepsilon_{n+1}} + E\\frac{d\\sigma_{y,n}}{d\\varepsilon_{n+1}} \\right) $$\nSubstituting the derivatives:\n$$ C_{\\text{alg}} = \\frac{1}{E+H} (H \\cdot E + E \\cdot 0) $$\n$$ C_{\\text{alg}} = \\frac{EH}{E+H} $$\nThis is the derived expression for the scalar algorithmic tangent modulus for one-dimensional linear isotropic hardening plasticity.

To analyze the continuity, we compare the two expressions at this transition boundary.\nGiven $E>0$ and the physical constraint $H \\ge 0$, we have $E+H \\ge E$. This implies that the fraction $\\frac{H}{E+H} \\le 1$.\nThe strict inequality $\\frac{H}{E+H}  1$ holds for any finite hardening modulus $H \\ge 0$ and $E>0$.\nConsequently, for any finite $H$:\n$$ \\mathbb{C}_{\\mathrm{alg}}^{\\mathrm{pl}} = E \\left( \\frac{H}{E+H} \\right)  E = \\mathbb{C}_{\\mathrm{alg}}^{\\mathrm{el}} $$\nThe equality $\\mathbb{C}_{\\mathrm{alg}}^{\\mathrm{pl}} = E$ would only be approached in the non-physical limit $H \\to \\infty$, which corresponds to an infinitely strong hardening that prevents any plastic strain from occurring.\nSince $\\mathbb{C}_{\\mathrm{alg}}^{\\mathrm{pl}} \\neq \\mathbb{C}_{\\mathrm{alg}}^{\\mathrm{el}}$ for any physically relevant hardening modulus, the algorithmic tangent modulus $\\mathbb{C}_{\\mathrm{alg}}$ exhibits a jump discontinuity when the material state crosses the yield surface (i.e., when $f_{\\mathrm{tr}}$ passes through zero).\n\nThe physical interpretation of this discontinuity is as follows. The tangent modulus represents the material's stiffness.\n- In the elastic regime, an increment of total strain $\\mathrm{d}\\epsilon$ is entirely accommodated by elastic deformation, $\\mathrm{d}\\epsilon^e = \\mathrm{d}\\epsilon$, leading to a stress increase $\\mathrm{d}\\sigma = E \\mathrm{d}\\epsilon$.\n- Upon yielding, a new, dissipative deformation mechanism—plastic flow—is abruptly activated. An increment of total strain $\\mathrm{d}\\epsilon$ is now partitioned into an elastic part $\\mathrm{d}\\epsilon^e$ and a plastic part $\\mathrm{d}\\epsilon^p$. The stress increase is governed only by the elastic part: $\\mathrm{d}\\sigma = E \\mathrm{d}\\epsilon^e = E(\\mathrm{d}\\epsilon - \\mathrm{d}\\epsilon^p)$. Because some of the imposed strain increment is consumed by permanent plastic flow ($\\mathrm{d}\\epsilon^p > 0$), less is available to generate stress, resulting in a lower effective stiffness.\nThe discontinuity in the tangent modulus from $E$ to $\\frac{EH}{E+H}$ is the mathematical manifestation of this sudden switch in the material's internal response mechanism, a characteristic feature of rate-independent plasticity models with a sharp yield surface.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} E  \\frac{EH}{E+H} \\end{pmatrix}}\n$$", "id": "2694728"}, {"introduction": "The theoretical elegance of the consistent tangent modulus is matched by its practical power, which this hands-on coding exercise demonstrates [@problem_id:2694699].

A total strain increment $\\Delta \\varepsilon = 0.02$ is applied, resulting in a total strain $\\varepsilon_{n+1} = \\varepsilon_n + \\Delta \\varepsilon = 0.02$. The state at step $n+1$, specifically the plastic strain $\\varepsilon^p_{n+1}$, must be determined by solving the constitutive equations. For both models, this requires a local iterative Newton-Raphson scheme. The core of the task is to derive the residual and the consistent Jacobian for this scheme.\n\nFirst, we define a trial state by assuming the step is purely elastic:\n$$ \\varepsilon^{p, \\text{trial}}_{n+1} = \\varepsilon^p_n = 0 $$\n$$ \\sigma^{\\text{trial}}_{n+1} = E (\\varepsilon_{n+1} - \\varepsilon^{p, \\text{trial}}_{n+1}) = E \\varepsilon_{n+1} $$\nWith the given data, $\\sigma^{\\text{trial}}_{n+1} = 210000\\,\\mathrm{MPa} \\times 0.02 = 4200\\,\\mathrm{MPa}$.\n\nThe yield function is $f(\\sigma, \\varepsilon^p) = \\sigma - \\sigma_{y0} - H\\varepsilon^p$. We evaluate it at the trial state:\n$$ f^{\\text{trial}} = f(\\sigma^{\\text{trial}}_{n+1}, \\varepsilon^p_n) = \\sigma^{\\text{trial}}_{n+1} - \\sigma_{y0} - H\\varepsilon^p_n $$\nSince $\\varepsilon^p_n = 0$, $f^{\\text{trial}} = 4200\\,\\mathrm{MPa} - 250\\,\\mathrm{MPa} = 3950\\,\\mathrm{MPa}$.\nAs $f^{\\text{trial}} > 0$, plastic flow occurs in both models.\n\n### Model A: Rate-Independent Elastoplasticity\n\nThis model uses a backward-Euler return mapping algorithm. The objective is to find the plastic strain increment $\\Delta \\varepsilon^p$ such that the state at $n+1$ satisfies the yield condition, $f_{n+1}=0$. The problem specifies using the plastic multiplier increment $\\Delta \\gamma$ as the unknown, with $\\Delta \\varepsilon^p = \\Delta \\gamma$ for this monotonic uniaxial case.\n\nThe state variables at step $n+1$ are functions of $\\Delta \\gamma$:\n$$ \\varepsilon^p_{n+1}(\\Delta \\gamma) = \\varepsilon^p_n + \\Delta \\gamma $$\n$$ \\sigma_{n+1}(\\Delta \\gamma) = E(\\varepsilon_{n+1} - \\varepsilon^p_{n+1}) = E(\\varepsilon_{n+1} - \\varepsilon^p_n - \\Delta \\gamma) $$\n\nThe local problem is to find $\\Delta \\gamma$ that solves the nonlinear (in general) equation posed by the discrete consistency condition, $f_{n+1}=0$. We define a residual function $R(\\Delta \\gamma)$ for the Newton-Raphson method, which is the yield function itself:\n$$ R(\\Delta \\gamma) = f(\\sigma_{n+1}(\\Delta \\gamma), \\varepsilon^p_{n+1}(\\Delta \\gamma)) = \\sigma_{n+1}(\\Delta \\gamma) - \\sigma_{y0} - H \\varepsilon^p_{n+1}(\\Delta \\gamma) $$\nSubstituting the expressions for the state variables:\n$$ R(\\Delta \\gamma) = E(\\varepsilon_{n+1} - \\varepsilon^p_n - \\Delta \\gamma) - \\sigma_{y0} - H(\\varepsilon^p_n + \\Delta \\gamma) $$\n\nThe Newton-Raphson iteration is $\\Delta \\gamma^{(k+1)} = \\Delta \\gamma^{(k)} - (J^{(k)})^{-1} R(\\Delta \\gamma^{(k)})$, where $J$ is the consistent Jacobian, $J = \\frac{dR}{d(\\Delta \\gamma)}$.\n$$ J = \\frac{d}{d(\\Delta \\gamma)} \\left[ E(\\varepsilon_{n+1} - \\varepsilon^p_n - \\Delta \\gamma) - \\sigma_{y0} - H(\\varepsilon^p_n + \\Delta \\gamma) \\right] $$\n$$ J = -E - H $$\nFor linear hardening, this Jacobian is constant.\n\nThe Newton-Raphson algorithm is:\n1. Initialize with $\\Delta \\gamma^{(0)} = 0$.\n2. For iteration $k=0, 1, 2, \\dots$:\n   a. Calculate the residual: $R^{(k)} = E(\\varepsilon_{n+1} - \\varepsilon^p_n - \\Delta \\gamma^{(k)}) - \\sigma_{y0} - H(\\varepsilon^p_n + \\Delta \\gamma^{(k)})$.\n   b. Check for convergence: If $|R^{(k)}|  10^{-9}\\,\\mathrm{MPa}$, stop.\n   c. Calculate the update: $\\delta(\\Delta \\gamma) = -R^{(k)}/J = -R^{(k)}/(-E-H)$.\n   d. Update the solution: $\\Delta \\gamma^{(k+1)} = \\Delta \\gamma^{(k)} + \\delta(\\Delta \\gamma)$.\n\nSince the residual $R(\\Delta \\gamma)$ is a linear function of $\\Delta \\gamma$, the Newton-Raphson method with the exact Jacobian will converge in a single iteration. The number of iterations is therefore $1$ and is independent of the pseudo-time step $\\Delta t$, which does not appear in the rate-independent formulation.\n\n### Model B: Rate-Dependent Viscoplasticity\n\nThis model employs the Perzyna flow rule, discretized using the implicit backward-Euler scheme. The unknown is the viscoplastic strain increment, which we denote $\\Delta \\varepsilon^p$.\nThe flow rule is $\\dot{\\varepsilon}^p = \\dot{\\gamma} = \\eta_v^{-1}\\langle f/\\sigma_{0} \\rangle^m$. The backward-Euler discretization gives:\n$$ \\frac{\\Delta \\varepsilon^p}{\\Delta t} = \\frac{1}{\\eta_v} \\left\\langle \\frac{f(\\sigma_{n+1}, \\varepsilon^p_{n+1})}{\\sigma_0} \\right\\rangle^m $$\nGiven that plastic flow is active, the Macaulay bracket $\\langle \\cdot \\rangle$ is identity. The equation to be solved for $\\Delta \\varepsilon^p$ is:\n$$ \\Delta \\varepsilon^p - \\frac{\\Delta t}{\\eta_v} \\left( \\frac{f_{n+1}}{\\sigma_0} \\right)^m = 0 $$\nThe yield function $f_{n+1}$ depends on $\\Delta \\varepsilon^p$:\n$$ f_{n+1}(\\Delta \\varepsilon^p) = \\sigma_{n+1} - \\sigma_{y0} - H \\varepsilon^p_{n+1} = E(\\varepsilon_{n+1} - (\\varepsilon^p_n + \\Delta \\varepsilon^p)) - \\sigma_{y0} - H(\\varepsilon^p_n + \\Delta \\varepsilon^p) $$\n$$ f_{n+1}(\\Delta \\varepsilon^p) = E\\varepsilon_{n+1} - \\sigma_{y0} - (E+H)\\varepsilon^p_n - (E+H)\\Delta \\varepsilon^p $$\nThe residual for the Newton-Raphson method is:\n$$ R(\\Delta \\varepsilon^p) = \\Delta \\varepsilon^p - \\frac{\\Delta t}{\\eta_v \\sigma_0^m} \\left( E\\varepsilon_{n+1} - \\sigma_{y0} - (E+H)\\varepsilon^p_n - (E+H)\\Delta \\varepsilon^p \\right)^m  = 0 $$\nThe consistent Jacobian required for the Newton solver is $J = \\frac{dR}{d(\\Delta \\varepsilon^p)}$.\n$$ J = 1 - \\frac{\\Delta t}{\\eta_v \\sigma_0^m} \\cdot m \\left( f_{n+1} \\right)^{m-1} \\cdot \\frac{df_{n+1}}{d(\\Delta \\varepsilon^p)} $$\nThe derivative of $f_{n+1}$ with respect to $\\Delta \\varepsilon^p$ is:\n$$ \\frac{df_{n+1}}{d(\\Delta \\varepsilon^p)} = -(E+H) $$\nThus, the Jacobian is:\n$$ J(\\Delta \\varepsilon^p) = 1 + \\frac{\\Delta t \\cdot m \\cdot (E+H)}{\\eta_v \\sigma_0^m} \\left( f_{n+1}(\\Delta \\varepsilon^p) \\right)^{m-1} $$\nFor this problem, $m=2$, so the expression simplifies to:\n$$ J(\\Delta \\varepsilon^p) = 1 + \\frac{2 \\Delta t (E+H)}{\\eta_v \\sigma_0^2} f_{n+1}(\\Delta \\varepsilon^p) $$\n\nThe Newton-Raphson algorithm is:\n1. Initialize with $\\Delta \\varepsilon^{p(0)} = 0$.\n2. For iteration $k=0, 1, 2, \\dots$:\n   a. Calculate $f_{n+1}^{(k)}$ using $\\Delta \\varepsilon^{p(k)}$.\n   b. Calculate the residual: $R^{(k)} = \\Delta \\varepsilon^{p(k)} - \\frac{\\Delta t}{\\eta_v} (f_{n+1}^{(k)}/\\sigma_0)^m$.\n   c. Check for convergence: If $|R^{(k)}|  10^{-12}$, stop.\n   d. Calculate the Jacobian: $J^{(k)} = 1 + \\frac{\\Delta t \\cdot m \\cdot (E+H)}{\\eta_v \\sigma_0^m} (f_{n+1}^{(k)})^{m-1}$.\n   e. Update the solution: $\\Delta \\varepsilon^{p(k+1)} = \\Delta \\varepsilon^{p(k)} - R^{(k)}/J^{(k)}$.\n\nThe Jacobian $J$ and residual $R$ both depend on the pseudo-time step $\\Delta t$. As $\\Delta t$ increases, the problem becomes numerically stiffer (the second term in $J$ dominates), and the nonlinearity of the residual function $R$ becomes more pronounced. This typically leads to an increase in the number of iterations required for convergence from a fixed starting point. Conversely, for very small $\\Delta t$, the function $R(\\Delta \\varepsilon^p)$ is nearly linear, leading to rapid convergence.\n\nThe implementation will follow these derived algorithms.", "answer": "[1,1,1,1,2,2,3,4]", "id": "2694699"}]}
