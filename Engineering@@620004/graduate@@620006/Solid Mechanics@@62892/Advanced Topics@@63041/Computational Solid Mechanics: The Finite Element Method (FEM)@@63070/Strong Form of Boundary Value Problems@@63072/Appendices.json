It presents a standard task in the theory of linear elasticity, which is to derive and apply the Saint-Venant compatibility condition for strain. All necessary definitions and assumptions are provided, and there are no contradictions or ambiguities. Thus, a solution may be attempted.\n\nThe task is to first derive the compatibility condition for a two-dimensional infinitesimal strain field, and then apply it to a specific tensor field.\n\nAn infinitesimal strain field $\\varepsilon$ is said to be compatible if it can be derived from a single-valued, continuous displacement field $u(x,y) = \\big(u_{1}(x,y), u_{2}(x,y)\\big)$. The components of the infinitesimal strain tensor $\\varepsilon$ are defined in terms of the displacement field components as:\n$$\n\\varepsilon_{xx} = \\frac{\\partial u_{1}}{\\partial x}\n$$\n$$\n\\varepsilon_{yy} = \\frac{\\partial u_{2}}{\\partial y}\n$$\n$$\n\\varepsilon_{xy} = \\frac{1}{2} \\left( \\frac{\\partial u_{1}}{\\partial y} + \\frac{\\partial u_{2}}{\\partial x} \\right)\n$$\nThese three equations relate the three components of the strain tensor to the two components of the displacement vector. For a given strain field $(\\varepsilon_{xx}, \\varepsilon_{yy}, \\varepsilon_{xy})$ to be derivable from a displacement field $(u_{1}, u_{2})$, these three relations must hold simultaneously. We can eliminate the displacement components $u_{1}$ and $u_{2}$ by differentiation. The problem assumes sufficient smoothness such that the order of partial differentiation may be interchanged.\n\nWe differentiate $\\varepsilon_{xx}$ twice with respect to $y$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial^2 \\varepsilon_{xx}}{\\partial y^2} = \\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial y^2} \\left( \\frac{\\partial u_{1}}{\\partial x} \\right) = \\frac{\\partial^3 u_{1}}{\\partial y^2 \\partial x}\n$$\nNext, we differentiate $\\varepsilon_{yy}$ twice with respect to $x$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial^2 \\varepsilon_{yy}}{\\partial x^2} = \\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial x^2} \\left( \\frac{\\partial u_{2}}{\\partial y} \\right) = \\frac{\\partial^3 u_{2}}{\\partial x^2 \\partial y}\n$$\nFinally, we differentiate the shear strain component $\\varepsilon_{xy}$ with respect to both $x$ and $y$:\n$$\n2\\frac{\\partial^2 \\varepsilon_{xy}}{\\partial x \\partial y} = \\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial x \\partial y} \\left( \\frac{\\partial u_{1}}{\\partial y} + \\frac{\\partial u_{2}}{\\partial x} \\right) = \\frac{\\partial^3 u_{1}}{\\partial x \\partial y^2} + \\frac{\\partial^3 u_{2}}{\\partial y \\partial x^2}\n$$\nGiven the commutativity of mixed partial derivatives for a smooth displacement field, we have $\\frac{\\partial^3 u_{1}}{\\partial y^2 \\partial x} = \\frac{\\partial^3 u_{1}}{\\partial x \\partial y^2}$ and $\\frac{\\partial^3 u_{2}}{\\partial x^2 \\partial y} = \\frac{\\partial^3 u_{2}}{\\partial y \\partial x^2}$.\n\nBy summing the first two results, we get:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial^2 \\varepsilon_{xx}}{\\partial y^2} + \\frac{\\partial^2 \\varepsilon_{yy}}{\\partial x^2} = \\frac{\\partial^3 u_{1}}{\\partial y^2 \\partial x} + \\frac{\\partial^3 u_{2}}{\\partial x^2 \\partial y}\n$$\nComparing this with the third result, we establish the following necessary condition:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial^2 \\varepsilon_{xx}}{\\partial y^2} + \\frac{\\partial^2 \\varepsilon_{yy}}{\\partial x^2} = 2 \\frac{\\partial^2 \\varepsilon_{xy}}{\\partial x \\partial y}\n$$\nThis is the required scalar differential compatibility condition. A strain field that does not satisfy this equation cannot be generated by any smooth, single-valued displacement field. For a simply connected domain $\\Omega$, this condition is also sufficient.\n\nNow, we must apply this condition to the given symmetric tensor field $E(x,y)$, which has components:\n$$\nE_{xx}(x,y) = 0\n$$\n$$\nE_{yy}(x,y) = 0\n$$\n$$\nE_{xy}(x,y) = xy\n$$\nThe problem requires the evaluation of the compatibility expression, defined as $\\frac{\\partial^2 E_{xx}}{\\partial y^2} + \\frac{\\partial^2 E_{yy}}{\\partial x^2} - 2 \\frac{\\partial^2 E_{xy}}{\\partial x \\partial y}$. We compute the necessary second-order partial derivatives:\n\nFor $E_{xx}$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial E_{xx}}{\\partial y} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}(0) = 0\n\\implies\n\\frac{\\partial^2 E_{xx}}{\\partial y^2} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}(0) = 0\n$$\nFor $E_{yy}$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial E_{yy}}{\\partial x} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}(0) = 0\n\\implies\n\\frac{\\partial^2 E_{yy}}{\\partial x^2} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}(0) = 0\n$$\nFor $E_{xy}$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial E_{xy}}{\\partial y} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}(xy) = x\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial^2 E_{xy}}{\\partial x \\partial y} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} \\left( \\frac{\\partial E_{xy}}{\\partial y} \\right) = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}(x) = 1\n$$\nSubstituting these results into the compatibility expression:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial^2 E_{xx}}{\\partial y^2} + \\frac{\\partial^2 E_{yy}}{\\partial x^2} - 2 \\frac{\\partial^2 E_{xy}}{\\partial x \\partial y} = 0 + 0 - 2(1) = -2\n$$\nThe compatibility condition dictates that for a strain field to be valid, this expression must be identically zero. Here, it evaluates to the non-zero constant $-2$.\n\nThe implication is direct. The compatibility condition is a necessary consequence of the existence of a smooth displacement field $u(x,y)$. Since the given tensor field $E(x,y)$ violates this necessary condition (as $0+0 \\neq 2(1)$), it is an incompatible strain field. Therefore, there exists no single-valued displacement field $u$ for which the infinitesimal strain $\\varepsilon(u)$ is equal to $E$ on any open set where $E$ is defined. The contradiction $0=2$ proves the non-existence of such a field $u$.\n\nThe problem asks for the exact simplified scalar expression resulting from the evaluation.
