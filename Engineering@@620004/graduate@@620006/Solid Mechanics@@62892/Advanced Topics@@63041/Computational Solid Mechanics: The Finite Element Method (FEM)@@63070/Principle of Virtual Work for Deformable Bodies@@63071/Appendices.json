The problem explicitly defines the virtual displacement of the tip, where the force is applied, as $\\delta x_{\\text{tip}} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ \\delta q_1 \\end{pmatrix}$. Adhering strictly to this given condition:\n$$ \\delta W_{\\text{ext}} = F \\cdot \\delta x_{\\text{tip}} = P \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos(q_2) \\\\ \\sin(q_2) \\end{pmatrix} \\cdot \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ \\delta q_1 \\end{pmatrix} = P \\sin(q_2) \\delta q_1 $$\nThis expression can be written as $\\delta W_{\\text{ext}} = \\delta q^T F_{\\text{ext}}$, where $F_{\\text{ext}}(q) = \\begin{pmatrix} P \\sin(q_2) \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}$ is the vector of generalized external forces.\n\nThe equilibrium statement, derived from the PVW ($\\delta W_{\\text{int}} - \\delta W_{\\text{ext}} = 0$) for arbitrary virtual displacements $\\delta q$, requires that the total residual vector $R(q) = F_{\\text{int}}(q) - F_{\\text{ext}}(q)$ must be zero.\n$$ [ (K_{e,11} q_1 + K_{e,12} q_2) - P \\sin(q_2) ] \\delta q_1 + [ (K_{e,21} q_1 + K_{e,22} q_2) - 0 ] \\delta q_2 = 0 $$\nSince this must hold for any $\\delta q_1$ and $\\delta q_2$, the coefficients must vanish, yielding the equilibrium equations:\n$$ R_1(q_1, q_2) = K_{e,11} q_1 + K_{e,12} q_2 - P \\sin(q_2) = 0 $$\n$$ R_2(q_1, q_2) = K_{e,21} q_1 + K_{e,22} q_2 = 0 $$\n\n**2) Existence of a Scalar Potential**\n\nA generalized force vector $F_{\\text{ext}}(q)$ is conservative if and only if it can be expressed as the negative gradient of a scalar potential function $\\Pi(q)$, i.e., $F_{\\text{ext}} = -\\nabla \\Pi$. A necessary condition for the existence of such a potential in a two-dimensional configuration space $(q_1, q_2)$ is the satisfaction of the integrability (or curl-free) condition:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial F_{\\text{ext},1}}{\\partial q_2} = \\frac{\\partial F_{\\text{ext},2}}{\\partial q_1} $$\nFrom the previous section, the generalized external forces are $F_{\\text{ext},1} = P \\sin(q_2)$ and $F_{\\text{ext},2} = 0$. We compute the partial derivatives:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial F_{\\text{ext},1}}{\\partial q_2} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial q_2} (P \\sin(q_2)) = P \\cos(q_2) $$\n$$ \\frac{\\partial F_{\\text{ext},2}}{\\partial q_1} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial q_1} (0) = 0 $$\nThe condition $P \\cos(q_2) = 0$ is not satisfied for arbitrary configurations $(q_1, q_2)$ and non-zero load $P$. Therefore, the follower force is non-conservative, and no scalar potential exists for this load in the specified configuration space.\n\n**3) Consistent Tangent Matrix and its Nonsymmetry**\n\nThe consistent tangent matrix, $K_T$, is obtained by linearizing the equilibrium equations. It is defined as the Jacobian of the residual vector $R(q)$ with respect to the generalized coordinates $q$:\n$$ K_T = \\frac{\\partial R(q)}{\\partial q} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{\\partial R_1}{\\partial q_1} & \\frac{\\partial R_1}{\\partial q_2} \\\\ \\frac{\\partial R_2}{\\partial q_1} & \\frac{\\partial R_2}{\\partial q_2} \\end{pmatrix} $$\nThe residual vector is $R(q) = K_e q - F_{\\text{ext}}(q)$. The tangent matrix is thus $K_T = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial q}(K_e q) - \\frac{\\partial F_{\\text{ext}}(q)}{\\partial q}$.\nThe first term is simply the elastic stiffness matrix $K_e$, since it is constant.\nThe second term is the load stiffness matrix, let us call it $K_L = \\frac{\\partial F_{\\text{ext}}(q)}{\\partial q}$:\n$$ K_L = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{\\partial (P \\sin q_2)}{\\partial q_1} & \\frac{\\partial (P \\sin q_2)}{\\partial q_2} \\\\ \\frac{\\partial (0)}{\\partial q_1} & \\frac{\\partial (0)}{\\partial q_2} \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & P \\cos(q_2) \\\\ 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} $$\nThe total consistent tangent matrix is $K_T(q) = K_e - K_L$:\n$$ K_T(q) = \\begin{pmatrix} K_{e,11} & K_{e,12} - P \\cos(q_2) \\\\ K_{e,21} & K_{e,22} \\end{pmatrix} $$\nThe elastic stiffness matrix $K_e$ is symmetric ($K_{e,12} = K_{e,21}$) because its integrand $N_i''(x) N_j''(x)$ is symmetric in the indices $i, j$.\nThe off-diagonal terms of the tangent matrix are $K_{T,12} = K_{e,12} - P \\cos(q_2)$ and $K_{T,21} = K_{e,21}$.\nSince $K_{e,12} = K_{e,21}$, the tangent matrix is symmetric only if $P \\cos(q_2) = 0$. In general, this is not true. Therefore, $K_T$ is nonsymmetric.\n\n**4) Skew-Symmetric Part of the Tangent Matrix**\n\nWe are asked to evaluate the skew-symmetric part of the consistent tangent matrix at the straight configuration, which corresponds to $q_1=0$ and $q_2=0$. First, we evaluate $K_T$ at $q = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}$. Let this matrix be denoted by $K$.\n$$ K = K_T(0) = \\begin{pmatrix} K_{e,11} & K_{e,12} - P \\cos(0) \\\\ K_{e,21} & K_{e,22} \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} K_{e,11} & K_{e,12} - P \\\\ K_{e,21} & K_{e,22} \\end{pmatrix} $$\nThe components of this matrix are $K_{11} = K_{e,11}$, $K_{12} = K_{e,12} - P$, $K_{21} = K_{e,21}$, and $K_{22} = K_{e,22}$.\nThe skew-symmetric matrix $S$ is defined as $S = \\frac{1}{2}(K - K^T)$. Its unique non-zero entry for $i<j$ is $S_{12}$.\n$$ S_{12} = \\frac{K_{12} - K_{21}}{2} $$\nSubstituting the expressions for $K_{12}$ and $K_{21}$:\n$$ S_{12} = \\frac{(K_{e,12} - P) - K_{e,21}}{2} $$\nUsing the property of symmetry of the elastic stiffness matrix, $K_{e,12} = K_{e,21}$, the expression simplifies:\n$$ S_{12} = \\frac{K_{e,12} - P - K_{e,12}}{2} = \\frac{-P}{2} $$\nThis result depends only on the magnitude of the follower force $P$ and is independent of the beam's material and geometric properties ($E, I, L$), a direct consequence of the non-conservative nature of the load as formulated. The physical unit of $S_{12}$ is force, as it is proportional to $P$, which is measured in Newtons (N).", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{-\\frac{P}{2}} $$", "id": "2676326"}]}
