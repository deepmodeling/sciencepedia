The problem is well-posed, providing all necessary definitions and variables ($L$, $EI(x)$, $q(x)$) to perform the required derivation. The language is objective and precise.\n\nThere is a potential for misinterpretation in the instructions. The problem asks to derive the weak form by operating on the strong form, yet it also states the derivation must begin from the PVW. A standard derivation proceeds from the PVW to establish the weak form, from which the strong form can subsequently be derived under sufficient smoothness assumptions. The reverse path, from strong to weak form, is a common pedagogical exercise to introduce the weak formulation and correctly identify boundary terms. The problem is interpreted as a request for a complete theoretical exposition: first, to establish the strong form from the PVW to demonstrate first-principles grounding, and second, to execute the specified procedure of multiplying the strong form by a test function to derive the weak form and analyze the boundary conditions. This interpretation resolves the apparent procedural conflict, rendering the problem self-contained and logically consistent. The problem is therefore valid.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. The solution will proceed.\n\nThe derivation begins with the Principle of Virtual Work (PVW), which states that for a body in static equilibrium, the internal virtual work done by stresses equals the external virtual work done by applied loads for any kinematically admissible virtual displacement. In the context of the given beam, this is stated as $\\delta W_{\\text{int}} = \\delta W_{\\text{ext}}$.\n\nThe internal virtual work, $\\delta W_{\\text{int}}$, is the work done by the internal moment $M(x)$ through the virtual curvature change $\\delta\\kappa(x)$:\n$$ \\delta W_{\\text{int}} = \\int_{0}^{L} M(x) \\delta\\kappa(x) \\, dx $$\nThe external virtual work, $\\delta W_{\\text{ext}}$, is the work done by the distributed load $q(x)$ through the virtual displacement $\\delta w(x)$:\n$$ \\delta W_{\\text{ext}} = \\int_{0}^{L} q(x) \\delta w(x) \\, dx $$\nWe do not include boundary loads in the initial expression for $\\delta W_{\\text{ext}}$; they will arise naturally from the analysis of $\\delta W_{\\text{int}}$.\n\nLet the arbitrary, kinematically admissible virtual displacement be denoted by the test function $v(x) = \\delta w(x)$. The virtual quantities are related through the kinematic definitions: $\\delta\\kappa(x) = \\delta(w''(x)) = (\\delta w(x))'' = v''(x)$. Substituting the constitutive relation $M(x) = EI(x) w''(x)$, the PVW becomes:\n$$ \\int_{0}^{L} EI(x) w''(x) v''(x) \\, dx = \\int_{0}^{L} q(x) v(x) \\, dx $$\nThis is the weak (or variational) form of the equilibrium equation, assuming boundary conditions are such that no work is done at the boundaries (e.g., for a beam clamped at both ends, where $v(0)=v'(0)=v(L)=v'(L)=0$).\n\nTo derive the strong form from this, we apply integration by parts to the left-hand side to transfer derivatives from the test function $v(x)$ to the trial function $w(x)$.\n$$ \\int_{0}^{L} EI(x) w''(x) v''(x) \\, dx = \\left[ EI(x) w''(x) v'(x) \\right]_{0}^{L} - \\int_{0}^{L} (EI(x) w''(x))' v'(x) \\, dx $$\nApplying integration by parts a second time:\n$$ = \\left[ EI(x) w''(x) v'(x) \\right]_{0}^{L} - \\left( \\left[ (EI(x) w''(x))' v(x) \\right]_{0}^{L} - \\int_{0}^{L} (EI(x) w''(x))'' v(x) \\, dx \\right) $$\n$$ = \\int_{0}^{L} (EI(x) w''(x))'' v(x) \\, dx + \\left[ EI(x) w''(x) v'(x) - (EI(x) w''(x))' v(x) \\right]_{0}^{L} $$\nEquating this to the external virtual work integral gives:\n$$ \\int_{0}^{L} (EI(x) w''(x))'' v(x) \\, dx - \\int_{0}^{L} q(x) v(x) \\, dx = \\left[ (EI(x) w''(x))' v(x) - EI(x) w''(x) v'(x) \\right]_{0}^{L} $$\nBy the fundamental lemma of calculus of variations, if this equality must hold for all sufficiently smooth test functions $v(x)$ that vanish at the boundaries (i.e., $v(0)=v'(0)=v(L)=v'(L)=0$), the boundary terms are zero, and the integral must be zero. This implies the integrand must be zero everywhere in the domain $(0,L)$:\n$$ (EI(x) w''(x))'' = q(x) $$\nThis is the fourth-order ordinary differential equation which is the strong form of the Euler-Bernoulli beam equation.\n\nNow, as per the explicit instruction, we start with this strong form and multiply by an admissible test function $v(x)$ and integrate over the domain $[0,L]$:\n$$ \\int_{0}^{L} (EI(x) w''(x))'' v(x) \\, dx = \\int_{0}^{L} q(x) v(x) \\, dx $$\nWe apply integration by parts to the left-hand side (LHS) to reduce the order of the derivative on $w(x)$.\nFirst integration by parts:\n$$ \\int_{0}^{L} (EI w'')'' v \\, dx = \\left[ (EI w'')' v \\right]_{0}^{L} - \\int_{0}^{L} (EI w'')' v' \\, dx $$\nSecond integration by parts on the remaining integral:\n$$ -\\int_{0}^{L} (EI w'')' v' \\, dx = -\\left( \\left[ (EI w'') v' \\right]_{0}^{L} - \\int_{0}^{L} (EI w'') v'' \\, dx \\right) = \\int_{0}^{L} EI w'' v'' \\, dx - \\left[ EI w'' v' \\right]_{0}^{L} $$\nCombining these results, the LHS becomes:\n$$ \\text{LHS} = \\int_{0}^{L} EI(x) w''(x) v''(x) \\, dx + \\left[ (EI w'')' v \\right]_{0}^{L} - \\left[ EI w'' v' \\right]_{0}^{L} $$\nEquating this with the right-hand side from the weighted-residual statement gives the full weak form including boundary terms:\n$$ \\int_{0}^{L} EI(x) w''(x) v''(x) \\, dx + \\left[ (EI(x) w''(x))' v(x) \\right]_{0}^{L} - \\left[ EI(x) w''(x) v'(x) \\right]_{0}^{L} = \\int_{0}^{L} q(x) v(x) \\, dx $$\nThis is the Galerkin form of the governing equation. The terms evaluated at the boundaries, $x=0$ and $x=L$, are the boundary terms.\n\nWe identify the physical quantities in these terms. The bending moment is $M(x) = EI(x) w''(x)$, and the transverse shear force is $V(x) = (EI(x) w''(x))'$. The boundary terms are therefore:\n$$ \\left[ V(x) v(x) - M(x) v'(x) \\right]_{0}^{L} $$\nThe weak form can be rearranged as:\n$$ \\int_{0}^{L} EI(x) w''(x) v''(x) \\, dx = \\int_{0}^{L} q(x) v(x) \\, dx + \\left[ V(x) v(x) - M(x) v'(x) \\right]_{L} - \\left[ V(x) v(x) - M(x) v'(x) \\right]_{0} $$\nThis equation must hold for any admissible test function $v(x)$. Boundary conditions are classified based on what is specified.\n\n**Essential (or geometric) boundary conditions** are those imposed on the trial function $w(x)$ itself, specifically on the primary variables $w$ (deflection) and $w'$ (slope). To maintain a valid function space, the test function $v(x)$ must satisfy the homogeneous form of these conditions.\n**Natural (or kinetic) boundary conditions** are those involving derivatives of the trial function, specifically the secondary variables $M=EIw''$ (moment) and $V=(EIw'')'$ (shear force). These conditions are not imposed on the trial function space but are satisfied \"naturally\" by the solution to the variational problem.\n\nLet's analyze the common support types at a boundary, say at $x=L$:\n1.  **Clamped (fixed) end**: The physical conditions are no deflection and no slope.\n    -   $w(L)=0$ and $w'(L)=0$.\n    -   These are specifications on the primary variables, so both are **essential** conditions.\n    -   For the formulation, the trial function must satisfy $w(L)=0, w'(L)=0$. The test function must satisfy $v(L)=0, v'(L)=0$. Consequently, the boundary terms at $x=L$, $V(L)v(L)$ and $M(L)v'(L)$, automatically vanish.\n\n2.  **Simply supported (pinned) end**: The physical conditions are no deflection and no bending moment.\n    -   $w(L)=0$ and $M(L)=EI(L)w''(L)=0$.\n    -   $w(L)=0$ is a specification on a primary variable, so it is an **essential** condition. The trial function must satisfy it, and the test function must satisfy $v(L)=0$.\n    -   $M(L)=0$ is a specification on a secondary variable, so it is a **natural** condition.\n    -   At the boundary $x=L$, the term $V(L)v(L)$ vanishes because $v(L)=0$. The term $M(L)v'(L)$ vanishes because the condition of the problem states $M(L)=0$.\n\n3.  **Free end**: The physical conditions are no bending moment and no shear force.\n    -   $M(L)=EI(L)w''(L)=0$ and $V(L)=(EIw'')'(L)=0$.\n    -   Both conditions are on secondary variables, so both are **natural** conditions.\n    -   No conditions are imposed on the trial function's primary variables, $w(L)$ and $w'(L)$. Therefore, the test function's values $v(L)$ and $v'(L)$ are arbitrary. For the boundary terms $V(L)v(L) - M(L)v'(L)$ to vanish for any $v(L)$ and $v'(L)$, the solution $w(x)$ must satisfy $V(L)=0$ and $M(L)=0$.\n\nThe weak form is often written as $a(w,v) = \\mathcal{L}(v)$, where $a(w,v)$ is a symmetric bilinear form and $\\mathcal{L}(v)$ is a linear functional of $v$. From our derivation:\n$$ a(w,v) = \\int_{0}^{L} EI(x) w''(x) v''(x) \\, dx $$\n$$ \\mathcal{L}(v) = \\int_{0}^{L} q(x) v(x) \\, dx + \\left[ Vv - Mv' \\right]_{L} - \\left[ Vv - Mv' \\right]_{0} $$\nThe problem asks specifically for the bilinear form $a(w,v)$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\int_{0}^{L} EI(x) w''(x) v''(x) \\, dx}\n$$", "id": "2679319"}, {"introduction": "Once a problem is cast in a variational form, the Rayleigh-Ritz method provides a powerful systematic procedure for finding an approximate solution.

Define the residual of the strong form as $R(x;a)=-u_h''(x)-p(x)$.\n\nTwo approximate solution strategies are to be compared:\n\n- Point collocation: enforce $R(x_c;a)=0$ at the single collocation point $x_c=1/2$.\n\n- Galerkin method: as a special case of the Weighted Residual Method (WRM), enforce $\\int_0^1 w(x)\\,R(x;a)\\,dx=0$ with the Galerkin weight $w(x)=\\phi(x)$.\n\nDerive, from first principles, the expressions for the coefficients $a_C$ (collocation) and $a_G$ (Galerkin) as functions of $A$ and $n$, and analyze how each responds to the oscillatory load component for large $n$ and for the parity of $n$ (even versus odd). Then select the option that correctly characterizes the sensitivity of point collocation to oscillatory residuals and explains how Galerkin’s integral weighting mitigates this sensitivity, including the correct explicit dependence of $a_C$ and $a_G$ on $A$ and $n$.\n\nOptions:\n\nA. For even $n$, both methods give $a=1/2$. For odd $n$, the collocation method yields $a_C=\\tfrac{1}{2}+\\tfrac{A}{2}\\,\\sin\\!\\big(n\\pi/2\\big)$, while the Galerkin method yields $a_G=\\tfrac{1}{2}+\\dfrac{12A}{(n\\pi)^3}$. Thus, point collocation can respond at $O(1)$ to the oscillatory load depending on where it samples the residual, whereas Galerkin’s integral weighting suppresses high-frequency sensitivity to $O(n^{-3})$.\n\nB. The collocation method always gives $a_C=1/2$ for all $n$, while the Galerkin method gives $a_G=\\tfrac{1}{2}+\\dfrac{12A}{(n\\pi)}$, so Galerkin is more sensitive to high-frequency loading than collocation.\n\nC. For odd $n$, the Galerkin method gives $a_G=1/2$, whereas the collocation method gives $a_C=\\tfrac{1}{2}+\\dfrac{12A}{(n\\pi)^3}$; hence collocation is less sensitive than Galerkin to oscillatory loads at high frequency.\n\nD. For even $n$, Galerkin gives $a_G=\\tfrac{1}{2}+\\dfrac{6A}{(n\\pi)^2}$ due to orthogonality with quadratic weights, while collocation gives $a_C=\\tfrac{1}{2}+\\tfrac{A}{2}$, showing that collocation is uniformly biased by the oscillation.\n\nE. Both methods give identical $a$ for all $n$ because there is only one parameter in the trial space; therefore, the choice of weighting has no effect on the computed coefficient.", "solution": "The problem statement is scientifically sound and well-posed. All necessary information is provided, and the objective is clear. We shall proceed with the derivation.\n\nThe governing equation for the axial bar is given as $-u''(x) = p(x)$ for $x \\in [0,1]$, with boundary conditions $u(0)=0$ and $u(1)=0$. The distributed load is $p(x)=1 + A \\,\\sin(n\\pi x)$.\nWe use a one-parameter trial solution $u_h(x) = a\\,\\phi(x)$, where the shape function is $\\phi(x)=x(1-x)=x-x^2$. This shape function correctly satisfies the essential boundary conditions: $\\phi(0)=0$ and $\\phi(1)=0$.\n\nFirst, we compute the second derivative of the trial solution:\n$$ u_h(x) = a(x-x^2) $$\n$$ u_h'(x) = a(1-2x) $$\n$$ u_h''(x) = -2a $$\nThe residual of the strong form is defined as $R(x;a) = -u_h''(x) - p(x)$. Substituting the expressions for $u_h''(x)$ and $p(x)$:\n$$ R(x;a) = -(-2a) - (1 + A\\,\\sin(n\\pi x)) = 2a - 1 - A\\,\\sin(n\\pi x) $$\n\nWe now derive the coefficient $a$ using the two specified methods.\n\n**1. Point Collocation Method**\n\nThis method requires the residual to be zero at a specific point, $x_c = 1/2$. We set $R(x_c; a_C) = 0$.\n$$ R(1/2; a_C) = 2a_C - 1 - A\\,\\sin(n\\pi \\cdot 1/2) = 0 $$\nSolving for the coefficient $a_C$:\n$$ 2a_C = 1 + A\\,\\sin\\left(\\frac{n\\pi}{2}\\right) $$\n$$ a_C = \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{A}{2}\\,\\sin\\left(\\frac{n\\pi}{2}\\right) $$\nWe analyze this result based on the parity of the integer $n$:\n- If $n$ is an even integer ($n=2k$ for $k \\in \\mathbb{N}$), then $\\sin(n\\pi/2) = \\sin(k\\pi) = 0$. In this case, $a_C = 1/2$.\n- If $n$ is an odd integer ($n=2k-1$ for $k \\in \\mathbb{N}$), then $\\sin(n\\pi/2)$ alternates between $1$ and $-1$. The magnitude of the oscillatory contribution to $a_C$ is $|A/2|$, which is of order $O(1)$ and does not decay as the frequency parameter $n$ increases.\n\n**2. Galerkin Method**\n\nThe Galerkin method enforces that the residual is orthogonal to the space of trial functions. For our one-parameter problem, this means the residual must be orthogonal to the shape function $\\phi(x)$. The weighting function is $w(x)=\\phi(x)=x-x^2$. The condition is $\\int_0^1 w(x)\\,R(x;a_G)\\,dx = 0$.\n$$ \\int_0^1 (x-x^2)\\left[2a_G - 1 - A\\,\\sin(n\\pi x)\\right]dx = 0 $$\nWe can separate the terms:\n$$ (2a_G - 1) \\int_0^1 (x-x^2)dx - A \\int_0^1 (x-x^2)\\sin(n\\pi x)dx = 0 $$\nWe evaluate the two integrals.\nThe first integral is elementary:\n$$ \\int_0^1 (x-x^2)dx = \\left[\\frac{x^2}{2} - \\frac{x^3}{3}\\right]_0^1 = \\frac{1}{2} - \\frac{1}{3} = \\frac{1}{6} $$\nThe second integral, let us denote it $I_n$, requires integration by parts twice:\n$$ I_n = \\int_0^1 (x-x^2)\\sin(n\\pi x)dx $$\nFirst integration by parts ($u=x-x^2$, $dv=\\sin(n\\pi x)dx$):\n$$ I_n = \\left[-(x-x^2)\\frac{\\cos(n\\pi x)}{n\\pi}\\right]_0^1 - \\int_0^1 \\left(-\\frac{\\cos(n\\pi x)}{n\\pi}\\right)(1-2x)dx $$\nThe boundary term is zero because $(x-x^2)$ is zero at $x=0$ and $x=1$.\n$$ I_n = \\frac{1}{n\\pi} \\int_0^1 (1-2x)\\cos(n\\pi x)dx $$\nSecond integration by parts ($u=1-2x$, $dv=\\cos(n\\pi x)dx$):\n$$ I_n = \\frac{1}{n\\pi} \\left( \\left[(1-2x)\\frac{\\sin(n\\pi x)}{n\\pi}\\right]_0^1 - \\int_0^1 \\frac{\\sin(n\\pi x)}{n\\pi}(-2)dx \\right) $$\nThe boundary term is zero because $\\sin(n\\pi)$ and $\\sin(0)$ are zero.\n$$ I_n = \\frac{2}{(n\\pi)^2} \\int_0^1 \\sin(n\\pi x)dx = \\frac{2}{(n\\pi)^2}\\left[-\\frac{\\cos(n\\pi x)}{n\\pi}\\right]_0^1 $$\n$$ I_n = -\\frac{2}{(n\\pi)^3}(\\cos(n\\pi) - \\cos(0)) = -\\frac{2}{(n\\pi)^3}((-1)^n-1) $$\nNow, we substitute this back into the Galerkin equation:\n$$ (2a_G - 1) \\left(\\frac{1}{6}\\right) - A \\left(-\\frac{2}{(n\\pi)^3}((-1)^n-1)\\right) = 0 $$\n$$ \\frac{2a_G - 1}{6} + \\frac{2A}{(n\\pi)^3}((-1)^n-1) = 0 $$\n$$ 2a_G - 1 = - \\frac{12A}{(n\\pi)^3}((-1)^n-1) $$\n$$ a_G = \\frac{1}{2} - \\frac{6A}{(n\\pi)^3}((-1)^n-1) $$\nWe analyze this result based on the parity of $n$:\n- If $n$ is an even integer, $(-1)^n-1 = 0$. In this case, $a_G = 1/2$. This occurs because the symmetric test function $\\phi(x)=x(1-x)$ is orthogonal to the anti-symmetric load component $\\sin(n\\pi x)$ (for even $n$) over the symmetric interval $[0,1]$.\n- If $n$ is an odd integer, $(-1)^n-1 = -2$. In this case,\n$$ a_G = \\frac{1}{2} - \\frac{6A}{(n\\pi)^3}(-2) = \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{12A}{(n\\pi)^3} $$\nThe contribution from the oscillatory load decays rapidly as $O(n^{-3})$ for large $n$.\n\n**Summary of Results**\n- **Collocation:** $a_C = \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{A}{2}\\,\\sin\\left(\\frac{n\\pi}{2}\\right)$. For even $n$, $a_C=\\frac{1}{2}$. For odd $n$, $a_C$ oscillates with an amplitude that does not decay with $n$.\n- **Galerkin:** $a_G = \\frac{1}{2} - \\frac{6A}{(n\\pi)^3}((-1)^n-1)$. For even $n$, $a_G=\\frac{1}{2}$. For odd $n$, $a_G = \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{12A}{(n\\pi)^3}$.\n\nThe point collocation method is sensitive to the local value of the oscillatory load at the collocation point, which can lead to a large, non-decaying error contribution. The Galerkin method, through its integral formulation, effectively filters out high-frequency components of the residual, leading to a much more robust and accurate approximation in the presence of such oscillations. The sensitivity decays rapidly as $O(n^{-3})$.\n\n**Evaluation of Options**\n\n**A. For even $n$, both methods give $a=1/2$. For odd $n$, the collocation method yields $a_C=\\tfrac{1}{2}+\\tfrac{A}{2}\\,\\sin\\!\\big(n\\pi/2\\big)$, while the Galerkin method yields $a_G=\\tfrac{1}{2}+\\dfrac{12A}{(n\\pi)^3}$. Thus, point collocation can respond at $O(1)$ to the oscillatory load depending on where it samples the residual, whereas Galerkin’s integral weighting suppresses high-frequency sensitivity to $O(n^{-3})$.**\n- Statement for even $n$: Correct.

The collocation response is $O(1)$, while the Galerkin response is $O(n^{-3})$.\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\n**B. The collocation method always gives $a_C=1/2$ for all $n$, while the Galerkin method gives $a_G=\\tfrac{1}{2}+\\dfrac{12A}{(n\\pi)}$, so Galerkin is more sensitive to high-frequency loading than collocation.**\n- The expression for $a_C$ is incorrect. It is not always $1/2$.\n- The expression for $a_G$ is incorrect. The decay is $O(n^{-3})$, not $O(n^{-1})$.\n- The conclusion is incorrect.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**C. For odd $n$, the Galerkin method gives $a_G=1/2$, whereas the collocation method gives $a_C=\\tfrac{1}{2}+\\dfrac{12A}{(n\\pi)^3}$; hence collocation is less sensitive than Galerkin to oscillatory loads at high frequency.**\n- The expression for $a_G$ for odd $n$ is incorrect.\n- The expression for $a_C$ is incorrect; it has been confused with the Galerkin result.\n- The conclusion is incorrect.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**D.

Both methods give identical $a$ for all $n$ because there is only one parameter in the trial space; therefore, the choice of weighting has no effect on the computed coefficient.**\n- This statement is fundamentally false. Our derivation explicitly shows $a_C \\neq a_G$ for odd $n$. The choice of weighting scheme (a Dirac delta function for collocation, the shape function itself for Galerkin) is critical and yields different results.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\nOnly option A is consistent with our rigorous derivation.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2679442"}]}
