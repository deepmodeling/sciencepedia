The branch of the bounds for which the matrix (phase 1) is the reference phase is given by:\n$$ K_{\\mathrm{HS}} = K_1 + \\frac{v_2 (K_2 - K_1)}{1 + v_1 \\frac{K_2 - K_1}{K_1 + \\frac{4}{3}G_1}} $$\n$$ G_{\\mathrm{HS}} = G_1 + \\frac{v_2 (G_2 - G_1)}{1 + v_1 \\frac{G_2 - G_1}{G_1 + \\eta_1}} \\quad \\text{where} \\quad \\eta_1 = \\frac{G_1(9K_1+8G_1)}{6(K_1+2G_1)} $$\nThese bounds are known to be the exact solutions for a particular composite geometry (composite spheres assemblage), and they also provide the correct first-order term in volume fraction for a dilute random distribution of spherical inclusions.\n\nWe perform a first-order Taylor expansion of these expressions around $v_2 = 0$. Since $v_1 = 1 - v_2$, we have for any function $f(v_2)$: $f(v_2) \\approx f(0) + f'(0)v_2$.\n\nFor the bulk modulus $K_{\\mathrm{eff}}(v_2) = K_{\\mathrm{HS}}(v_2)$:\nAt $v_2=0$, $K_{\\mathrm{eff}}(0) = K_1$. The first derivative is:\n$$ \\frac{dK_{\\mathrm{eff}}}{dv_2} = \\frac{d}{dv_2} \\left( K_1 + \\frac{v_2 (K_2 - K_1)}{1 + (1-v_2) \\frac{K_2 - K_1}{K_1 + 4/3 G_1}} \\right) $$\nLet $\\delta_K = K_2-K_1$ and $\\alpha = \\frac{\\delta_K}{K_1+4/3 G_1}$.

For the shear modulus, we must show that the expressions from Part 1 and Part 2 are equivalent. This requires showing:\n$$ \\frac{1}{G_1+\\eta_1} = \\frac{S_G}{G_1} = \\frac{6(K_1+2G_1)}{5G_1(3K_1+4G_1)} $$\nLet us compute $G_1+\\eta_1$:\n$$ G_1+\\eta_1 = G_1 + \\frac{G_1(9K_1+8G_1)}{6(K_1+2G_1)} = \\frac{6G_1(K_1+2G_1) + G_1(9K_1+8G_1)}{6(K_1+2G_1)} $$\n$$ = \\frac{6G_1K_1+12G_1^2+9G_1K_1+8G_1^2}{6(K_1+2G_1)} = \\frac{15G_1K_1+20G_1^2}{6(K_1+2G_1)} = \\frac{5G_1(3K_1+4G_1)}{6(K_1+2G_1)} $$\nTaking the reciprocal:\n$$ \\frac{1}{G_1+\\eta_1} = \\frac{6(K_1+2G_1)}{5G_1(3K_1+4G_1)} $$\nThis is precisely the expression for $S_G/G_1$.

It is a standard problem in the micromechanics of composite materials. We shall proceed with the derivation and calculation.\n\nThe Hashin-Shtrikman (HS) bounds for the effective elastic moduli of an isotropic composite are derived from the variational principles of elasticity. These principles state that the strain energy stored in a body under prescribed boundary conditions is an extremum. Specifically, the principle of minimum potential energy provides upper bounds on the effective stiffness moduli, while the principle of minimum complementary energy provides lower bounds. The HS bounds are the tightest possible bounds for an isotropic two-phase composite given only the volume fractions and phase properties, without further information on the microstructure.\n\nThe derivation employs a \"comparison\" or \"reference\" homogeneous material. The bounds are obtained by constructing specific admissible trial fields for displacement or stress, which are based on the exact solution for a single coated sphere subjected to uniform far-field loading.\n\nFirst, we define the properties of the two phases.\nPhase $1$ (matrix): volume fraction $v_1 = 1 - 0.25 = 0.75$, bulk modulus $K_1 = 20$ GPa, shear modulus $G_1 = 8$ GPa.\nPhase $2$ (inclusion): volume fraction $v_2 = 0.25$, bulk modulus $K_2 = 120$ GPa, shear modulus $G_2 = 45$ GPa.\nWe observe that $K_2 > K_1$ and $G_2 > G_1$, so phase $2$ is the stiffer phase and phase $1$ is the softer phase.\n\nDerivation and Calculation of the Hashin-Shtrikman Upper Bound for Bulk Modulus, $K^{\\ast}_{HS+}$\n\nTo derive the upper bound for the effective bulk modulus, $K^{\\ast}$, one can apply the principle of minimum potential energy. The trial displacement field used in the HS methodology corresponds to that of a composite sphere assemblage where the stiffer phase ($2$) forms the matrix (shell) and the softer phase ($1$) forms the core. The relative volumes of core and shell are set to match the overall volume fractions $v_1$ and $v_2$. By solving the elasticity problem for such a composite sphere under hydrostatic loading and requiring self-consistency, one obtains an expression for the effective modulus. This expression is proven to be a rigorous upper bound.\n\nThe resulting formula for the HS upper bound on the bulk modulus is:\n$$\nK^{\\ast}_{HS+} = K_2 + \\frac{v_1}{\\frac{1}{K_1 - K_2} + \\frac{v_2}{K_2 + \\frac{4}{3}G_2}}\n$$\nThis bound is obtained when the stiffer phase ($K_2 > K_1$, $G_2 > G_1$) is chosen as the reference material.\n\nWe now substitute the given numerical values into this expression.

The required statically admissible trial stress field is constructed based on a model where the softer phase ($1$) serves as the matrix for the stiffer phase ($2$). This configuration yields a rigorous lower bound for the effective shear modulus of a statistically isotropic composite.

The isotropic relation between bulk modulus $K_i$, shear modulus $G_i$, and Poisson's ratio $\\nu_i$ is $K_i = \\frac{2G_i(1+\\nu_i)}{3(1-2\\nu_i)}$.\nFor phase 2, with $\\nu_2 = 0.1$, we have $K_2 = \\frac{2G_2(1+0.1)}{3(1-2 \\cdot 0.1)} = \\frac{2.2G_2}{2.4} = \\frac{11}{12}G_2$.\nFor phase 1, $K_1 = \\frac{2G_1(1+\\nu_1)}{3(1-2\\nu_1)}$.\nThe condition $K_2 \\ge K_1$ becomes $\\frac{11}{12}G_2 \\ge \\frac{2G_1(1+\\nu_1)}{3(1-2\\nu_1)}$, which implies $\\frac{G_2}{G_1} \\ge \\frac{8(1+\\nu_1)}{11(1-2\\nu_1)}$.\nFor any physically admissible Poisson's ratio $\\nu_1 \\in (-1, 0.5)$, the right-hand side is a finite positive constant. The problem considers the limit $G_2/G_1 \\to \\infty$, so this condition is satisfied for sufficiently large contrast. The HS bounds are thus applicable.\n\nThe general expressions for the lower ($G^{\\ast}_{-}$) and upper ($G^{\\ast}_{+}$) HS bounds for shear modulus are given by:\n$$ G^{\\ast}_{-} = G_1 + f_2 \\left[ \\frac{1}{G_2 - G_1} + \\frac{6 f_1 (K_1 + 2G_1)}{5 G_1 (3K_1 + 4G_1)} \\right]^{-1} $$\n$$ G^{\\ast}_{+} = G_2 + f_1 \\left[ \\frac{1}{G_1 - G_2} + \\frac{6 f_2 (K_2 + 2G_2)}{5 G_2 (3K_2 + 4G_2)} \\right]^{-1} $$\nwhere $f_1$ and $f_2$ are the volume fractions of the two phases.\n\nWe can simplify the modulus-dependent terms by expressing them through the Poisson's ratio $\\nu_i$. Let's define a helper term $\\alpha_i$:\n$$ \\alpha_i \\equiv \\frac{6 (K_i + 2G_i)}{5 (3K_i + 4G_i)} = \\frac{2(4-5\\nu_i)}{15(1-\\nu_i)} $$\nWith this, the bounds can be written as:\n$$ G^{\\ast}_{-} = G_1 + f_2 \\left[ \\frac{1}{G_2 - G_1} + \\frac{f_1 \\alpha_1}{G_1} \\right]^{-1} $$\n$$ G^{\\ast}_{+} = G_2 + f_1 \\left[ \\frac{1}{G_1 - G_2} + \\frac{f_2 \\alpha_2}{G_2} \\right]^{-1} $$\n\nFirst, we evaluate the asymptotic behavior of the lower bound, $G^{\\ast}_{-}$, as $G_2/G_1 \\to \\infty$. In this limit, the term $1/(G_2-G_1)$ vanishes.\n$$ G^{\\ast}_{-\\,\\text{asym}} = \\lim_{G_2/G_1 \\to \\infty} G^{\\ast}_{-} = G_1 + f_2 \\left[ 0 + \\frac{f_1 \\alpha_1}{G_1} \\right]^{-1} $$\n$$ G^{\\ast}_{-\\,\\text{asym}} = G_1 + f_2 \\frac{G_1}{f_1 \\alpha_1} = G_1 \\left( 1 + \\frac{f_2}{f_1 \\alpha_1} \\right) $$\nSubstituting the expression for $\\alpha_1$:\n$$ G^{\\ast}_{-\\,\\text{asym}} = G_1 \\left( 1 + \\frac{f_2}{f_1} \\frac{15(1-\\nu_1)}{2(4-5\\nu_1)} \\right) = G_1 \\left( 1 + \\frac{15 f_2 (1-\\nu_1)}{2 f_1 (4-5\\nu_1)} \\right) $$\nThis expression shows that the lower bound saturates to a value proportional to $G_1$ and is independent of $G_2$, which is physically expected as the softer phase forms the connected matrix in the model realizing this bound.\n\nNext, we evaluate the asymptotic behavior of the upper bound, $G^{\\ast}_{+}$, as $G_2/G_1 \\to \\infty$.\n$$ G^{\\ast}_{+} = G_2 + f_1 \\left[ \\frac{-1}{G_2 - G_1} + \\frac{f_2 \\alpha_2}{G_2} \\right]^{-1} $$\nTo find the leading-order behavior, we analyze the term in the brackets for large $G_2$:\n$$ \\frac{-1}{G_2(1 - G_1/G_2)} + \\frac{f_2 \\alpha_2}{G_2} = \\frac{1}{G_2} \\left[ -(1 - G_1/G_2)^{-1} + f_2 \\alpha_2 \\right] $$\nUsing the Taylor expansion $(1-x)^{-1} = 1+x+O(x^2)$ for small $x=G_1/G_2$:\n$$ \\frac{1}{G_2} \\left[ -(1 + G_1/G_2 + O((G_1/G_2)^2)) + f_2 \\alpha_2 \\right] = \\frac{1}{G_2} \\left[ f_2 \\alpha_2 - 1 - \\frac{G_1}{G_2} - \\dots \\right] $$\nThe inverse of this term is:\n$$ G_2 \\left( f_2 \\alpha_2 - 1 - \\frac{G_1}{G_2} - \\dots \\right)^{-1} = \\frac{G_2}{f_2 \\alpha_2 - 1} \\left( 1 - \\frac{G_1/G_2}{f_2 \\alpha_2 - 1} - \\dots \\right)^{-1} $$\n$$ = \\frac{G_2}{f_2 \\alpha_2 - 1} \\left( 1 + \\frac{G_1/G_2}{f_2 \\alpha_2 - 1} + \\dots \\right) = \\frac{G_2}{f_2 \\alpha_2 - 1} + O(G_1) $$\nThe leading-order behavior of $G^{\\ast}_{+}$ is thus:\n$$ G^{\\ast}_{+\\,\\text{asym}} = G_2 + f_1 \\left( \\frac{G_2}{f_2 \\alpha_2 - 1} \\right) = G_2 \\left( 1 + \\frac{f_1}{f_2 \\alpha_2 - 1} \\right) $$\nUsing $f_1+f_2=1$:\n$$ G^{\\ast}_{+\\,\\text{asym}} = G_2 \\left( \\frac{f_2 \\alpha_2 - 1 + f_1}{f_2 \\alpha_2 - 1} \\right) = G_2 \\left( \\frac{f_2 \\alpha_2 - f_2}{f_2 \\alpha_2 - 1} \\right) = G_2 \\frac{f_2 (\\alpha_2 - 1)}{f_2 \\alpha_2 - 1} $$\nWe are given $\\nu_2 = 0.1$.
