The bar is loaded in uniaxial tension under displacement control such that the macroscopic (volume-averaged) strain is prescribed as $\\bar{\\varepsilon} = \\Delta/L$, where $\\Delta$ is the imposed end-to-end displacement. Assume no body forces and small strains.

It is a standard problem in the homogenization of heterogeneous materials. We proceed with the derivation and numerical verification.\n\n### Part I: Analytical Derivation of the Homogenized Modulus\n\nThe derivation begins from the fundamental principles of one-dimensional solid mechanics for a bar under uniaxial tension, with no body forces.\n\n$1$. **Equilibrium**: The differential equation for equilibrium is:\n$$\n\\frac{d\\sigma}{dx} = 0\n$$\nwhere $\\sigma(x)$ is the axial stress at position $x$. This equation implies that the stress $\\sigma(x)$ must be constant throughout the bar. Let us denote this constant stress as $\\sigma_0$.\n$$\n\\sigma(x) = \\sigma_0\n$$\n\n$2$. **Homogenized Stress**: The macroscopic, or homogenized, stress $\\langle \\sigma \\rangle$ is defined as the volume average of the microscopic stress field over a representative volume element (RVE). For a one-dimensional periodic material, the RVE is a single unit cell of length $\\ell$. The average is:\n$$\n\\langle \\sigma \\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\ell} \\int_0^\\ell \\sigma(x) dx\n$$\nSince $\\sigma(x) = \\sigma_0$ is constant, the average stress is simply $\\sigma_0$.\n$$\n\\langle \\sigma \\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\ell} \\int_0^\\ell \\sigma_0 dx = \\sigma_0 \\frac{1}{\\ell} \\int_0^\\ell dx = \\sigma_0\n$$\n\n$3$. **Constitutive and Kinematic Relations**: The local constitutive relation is given by Hooke's law:\n$$\n\\sigma(x) = E(y) \\varepsilon(x)\n$$\nwhere $\\varepsilon(x)$ is the local strain and $E(y)$ is the Young's modulus, which varies periodically with the fast coordinate $y = x/\\ell$. The strain is related to the displacement field $u(x)$ by the kinematic equation:\n$$\n\\varepsilon(x) = \\frac{du}{dx}\n$$\nCombining the equilibrium result ($\\sigma(x) = \\sigma_0$) with the constitutive law, we can express the local strain as:\n$$\n\\varepsilon(x) = \\frac{\\sigma_0}{E(x/\\ell)}\n$$\n\n$4$. **Homogenized Strain**: The macroscopic strain $\\bar{\\varepsilon}$ is the average of the local strain over the RVE:\n$$\n\\bar{\\varepsilon} = \\langle \\varepsilon \\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\ell} \\int_0^\\ell \\varepsilon(x) dx\n$$\nAn equivalent definition, consistent with the imposed displacement boundary conditions, is $\\bar{\\varepsilon} = \\Delta/L = (u(L)-u(0))/L$. The connection is established by integrating the local strain:\n$$\nu(L) - u(0) = \\int_0^L \\frac{du}{dx} dx = \\int_0^L \\varepsilon(x) dx = L \\left( \\frac{1}{L} \\int_0^L \\varepsilon(x) dx \\right) = L \\langle \\varepsilon \\rangle_{L}\n$$\nDue to periodicity, the average over the total length $L$ is identical to the average over a single unit cell $\\ell$. Thus, $\\bar{\\varepsilon} = \\langle \\varepsilon \\rangle$.\n\nSubstituting the expression for $\\varepsilon(x)$ from step $3$ into the averaging integral:\n$$\n\\bar{\\varepsilon} = \\frac{1}{\\ell} \\int_0^\\ell \\frac{\\sigma_0}{E(x/\\ell)} dx\n$$\nWe perform a change of variables to the non-dimensional fast coordinate $y = x/\\ell$, which implies $dx = \\ell dy$. The limits of integration for $x$ from $0$ to $\\ell$ correspond to limits for $y$ from $0$ to $1$.\n$$\n\\bar{\\varepsilon} = \\frac{1}{\\ell} \\int_0^1 \\frac{\\sigma_0}{E(y)} (\\ell dy) = \\sigma_0 \\int_0^1 \\frac{1}{E(y)} dy\n$$\n\n$5$. **Homogenized Modulus**: The homogenized modulus $E^{\\text{hom}}$ is defined by the macroscopic constitutive relation:\n$$\n\\langle \\sigma \\rangle = E^{\\text{hom}} \\bar{\\varepsilon}\n$$\nSubstituting our expressions for $\\langle \\sigma \\rangle = \\sigma_0$ and $\\bar{\\varepsilon}$:\n$$\n\\sigma_0 = E^{\\text{hom}} \\left( \\sigma_0 \\int_0^1 \\frac{1}{E(y)} dy \\right)\n$$\nAssuming a non-trivial state of stress ($\\sigma_0 \\neq 0$), we can divide by $\\sigma_0$:\n$$\n1 = E^{\\text{hom}} \\int_0^1 \\frac{1}{E(y)} dy\n$$\nSolving for $E^{\\text{hom}}$, we arrive at the closed-form expression:\n$$\nE^{\\text{hom}} = \\left( \\int_0^1 \\frac{1}{E(y)} dy \\right)^{-1}\n$$\nThis result shows that for a one-dimensional bar in tension, the effective modulus is the harmonic average of the local modulus over the unit cell. This is analogous to springs connected in series, where the compliances (inverse stiffness) are additive.\n\n### Part II: Numerical Verification via Finite Element Method\n\nWe discretize a single unit cell of length $L=1$ into $N_e$ linear two-node finite elements. The length of each element is $h_e = L/N_e$.\n\nThe element stiffness matrix $\\mathbf{k}^e$ for an element connecting nodes $i$ and $j$ is given by:\n$$\n\\mathbf{k}^e = \\int_{\\text{element}} \\mathbf{B}^T (EA) \\mathbf{B} dx\n$$\nFor a linear element, the strain-displacement matrix $\\mathbf{B}$ is $\\mathbf{B} = \\frac{1}{h_e} [-1, 1]$. With cross-sectional area $A$, the stiffness matrix becomes:\n$$\n\\mathbf{k}^e = \\frac{A}{h_e^2} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & -1 \\\\ -1 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} \\int_{x_i}^{x_j} E(x) dx\n$$\nThe integral of the modulus over the element, $\\int_{x_i}^{x_j} E(x) dx$, is computed using a $4$-point Gaussian quadrature rule for high accuracy, as specified.\n\nThe global stiffness matrix $\\mathbf{K}$ is assembled from the element matrices. The system of equations is $\\mathbf{K}\\mathbf{U} = \\mathbf{F}$, where $\\mathbf{U}$ is the vector of nodal displacements and $\\mathbf{F}$ is the vector of external nodal forces.\nThe boundary conditions are $u(0)=0$ and $u(1)=\\bar{\\varepsilon}=1$. We partition the system to solve for the unknown internal displacements. Let the set of unknown displacements be $\\mathbf{U}_R$ and the set of prescribed displacements be $\\mathbf{U}_S = [u_0, u_{N_e}]^T = [0, 1]^T$. The relevant sub-system is:\n$$\n\\mathbf{K}_{RR}\\mathbf{U}_R = -\\mathbf{K}_{RS}\\mathbf{U}_S\n$$\nwhere $\\mathbf{K}_{RR}$ is the submatrix of $\\mathbf{K}$ corresponding to the free degrees of freedom, and $\\mathbf{K}_{RS}$ couples the free and prescribed degrees of freedom.\n\nAfter solving for $\\mathbf{U}_R$ and assembling the full displacement vector $\\mathbf{U}$, the reaction force vector $\\mathbf{F}_S$ is computed as:\n$$\n\\mathbf{F}_S = \\mathbf{K}_{SR}\\mathbf{U}_R + \\mathbf{K}_{SS}\\mathbf{U}_S\n$$\nSpecifically, the reaction force at the right end ($x=1$, node $N_e$) is $R = (\\mathbf{K}\\mathbf{U})_{N_e}$.\nThe average stress is then $\\langle \\sigma \\rangle = R/A$.\n\nThe numerically computed homogenized modulus is defined as:\n$$\nE^{\\text{hom}}_{\\text{FE}} = \\frac{\\langle \\sigma \\rangle}{\\bar{\\varepsilon}} = \\frac{R/A}{\\bar{\\varepsilon}/L}\n$$\nGiven the problem parameters $L=1$, $A=1$, and $\\bar{\\varepsilon}=1$, this simplifies to:\n$$\nE^{\\text{hom}}_{\\text{FE}} = R\n$$\nThe numerical results for the test cases are computed and compared against the analytical values derived from the harmonic average formula to determine the relative error.", "answer": "```python\n# The complete and runnable Python 3 code goes here.\n# Imports must adhere to the specified execution environment.\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy.special import roots_legendre\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Derives and numerically verifies the homogenized modulus for a 1D periodic bar.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # --- Test Case Definitions ---\n    # Each tuple contains the parameters for one case.\n    test_cases = [\n        # Case 1: (f1, E1, E2)\n        (0.3, 100e9, 200e9),\n        # Case 2: (f1, E1, E2) -

The macroscopic strain is a prescribed constant symmetric tensor $E \\in \\mathbb{R}^{2 \\times 2}$ applied at a single macroscopic integration point. The RVE features two isotropic linear elastic phases arranged in a left-right partition: the two elements whose centroids satisfy $x  0.5$ are material $A$, and the two elements with $x \\ge 0.5$ are material $B$. Assume plane strain kinematics. The objective is to set up the microscopic finite element boundary value problem with periodic boundary conditions, solve for the displacement field, and compute the volume-averaged Cauchy stress $\\Sigma = \\langle \\sigma \\rangle$ using numerical quadrature.\n\nFundamental base:\n- Balance of linear momentum without body forces: $\\nabla \\cdot \\sigma = 0$ in the RVE.\n- Kinematics: small strain with $\\varepsilon(u) = \\tfrac{1}{2}\\left(\\nabla u + \\nabla u^{\\mathsf{T}}\\right)$.\n- Constitutive behavior for each phase $p \\in \\{A,B\\}$: isotropic, linear elastic, plane strain, with Young's modulus $E_p$ and Poisson's ratio $\\nu_p$.

I will first verify its validity before proceeding.\n\n### Step 1: Extract Givens\n- **Domain:** Unit square Representative Volume Element (RVE), $|\\Omega|=1$.\n- **Discretization:** $2 \\times 2$ grid of bilinear quadrilateral elements ($9$ nodes, $4$ elements). $2 \\times 2$ Gauss quadrature.\n- **Microstructure:** Two-phase composite. Phase A for elements with centroid $x  0.5$, Phase B for $x \\ge 0.5$.\n- **Physics:** Small-strain, plane strain, linear isotropic elasticity. Balance of linear momentum $\\nabla \\cdot \\sigma = 0$.\n- **Constitutive Law:** Per phase $p \\in \\{A, B\\}$, $\\sigma = D_p \\varepsilon(u)$, with Young's modulus $E_p$ and Poisson's ratio $\\nu_p$.\n- **Boundary Conditions (BCs):** First-order periodic BCs: $u(x^{+}) - u(x^{-}) = E \\, \\Delta X$. The displacement at the origin is fixed: $u(0,0)=0$. The top-right corner node is excluded from direct constraint application to avoid linear dependency. BCs are to be enforced with Lagrange multipliers.\n- **Objective:** Compute the volume-averaged Cauchy stress $\\Sigma = \\langle \\sigma \\rangle$ for a given macroscopic strain tensor $E$.\n- **Averaging Formula:** $\\Sigma = \\frac{1}{|\\Omega|} \\sum_{e} \\sum_{q} \\sigma^{(e)}(x_q) \\, w_q \\, \\det J^{(e)}(x_q)$.\n- **Vector Conventions:** Strain vector is $[\\varepsilon_{xx}, \\varepsilon_{yy}, \\varepsilon_{xy}]^{\\mathsf{T}}$ (using tensorial shear strain).

The governing equations, kinematic assumptions, constitutive relations, and numerical procedures (FEM with periodic BCs) are well-established and form the foundation of multiscale modeling of materials. The problem is scientifically sound.\n- **Well-Posed:** The problem of finding the micro-scale displacement field is a linear boundary value problem. The use of periodic boundary conditions combined with a constraint to eliminate rigid body motion (fixing the displacement at the origin) ensures that the resulting linear system of equations for the nodal displacements has a unique solution. The specified method of using Lagrange multipliers to enforce constraints is a standard and robust technique that leads to a well-posed saddle-point problem.\n- **Objective:** The problem is stated using precise mathematical and engineering terminology. All parameters and objectives are quantitative and unambiguous.\n\nThe problem statement shows no signs of scientific unsoundness, missing information, contradiction, or ambiguity. It is a challenging but valid and well-defined computational problem.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. I will now proceed with the solution.\n\n### Principle-Based Solution Design\n\nThe problem requires solving a microscopic boundary value problem on a Representative Volume Element (RVE) to determine its effective mechanical response. This is achieved using the Finite Element Method (FEM).\n\n**1. Governing Equations**\nThe strong form of the equilibrium equation is the balance of linear momentum, which, in the absence of body forces, is $\\nabla \\cdot \\sigma = 0$ inside the RVE domain $\\Omega$. The problem is closed by a constitutive law, $\\sigma = D(\\varepsilon)$, and a kinematic relation, $\\varepsilon(u) = \\frac{1}{2}(\\nabla u + (\\nabla u)^T)$. The displacement field $u$ is decomposed into a macroscopic part and a periodic fluctuation part: $u(x) = E x + u'(x)$, where $E$ is the prescribed macroscopic strain and $u'$ is periodic on the boundary of the RVE.\n\n**2. Finite Element Discretization**\nThe RVE is a unit square, discretized by a $2 \\times 2$ mesh of $4$-node bilinear quadrilateral elements. This results in $9$ nodes and $18$ degrees of freedom (DOFs), since each node has two displacement components $(u_x, u_y)$. The nodal coordinates are $(0,0), (0.5,0), \\dots, (1,1)$. The elements are numbered and assigned material properties based on the x-coordinate of their centroids. Elements $0$ and $2$ (left column) are material A; elements $1$ and $3$ (right column) are material B.\n\nThe weak form of the equilibrium equation is discretized, leading to a linear system of equations $K U = F_{ext}$, where $K$ is the global stiffness matrix, $U$ is the vector of nodal displacements, and $F_{ext}$ are external nodal forces, which are zero in this context.\n\n**3. Constitutive and Stiffness Matrices**\nFor each phase, which is isotropic and linear elastic under plane strain conditions, the stress vector $\\sigma = [\\sigma_{xx}, \\sigma_{yy}, \\sigma_{xy}]^T$ relates to the strain vector $\\varepsilon = [\\varepsilon_{xx}, \\varepsilon_{yy}, \\varepsilon_{xy}]^T$ via the constitutive matrix $D$. The matrix $D$ is given by:\n$$\nD = \\begin{bmatrix}\n\\lambda+2G  \\lambda  0 \\\\\n\\lambda  \\lambda+2G  0 \\\\\n0  0  2G\n\\end{bmatrix}\n$$\nwhere the Lamé parameters are $\\lambda = \\frac{E \\nu}{(1+\\nu)(1-2\\nu)}$ and $G = \\frac{E}{2(1+\\nu)}$. The term $2G$ in the bottom-right corner is due to the use of tensorial shear strain $\\varepsilon_{xy}$, as $\\sigma_{xy} = 2G \\varepsilon_{xy}$.\n\nThe element stiffness matrix $K^e$ for an element $\\Omega_e$ is computed by integrating over the element volume:\n$$\nK^e = \\int_{\\Omega_e} B^T D B \\,d\\Omega\n$$\nwhere $B$ is the strain-displacement matrix, which relates nodal displacements to strain: $\\varepsilon = B u^e$. The integral is evaluated numerically using $2 \\times 2$ Gauss quadrature. The global stiffness matrix $K$ is assembled by summing the contributions from all element stiffness matrices.\n\n**4. Boundary Conditions and System Solution**\nThe periodic boundary conditions and the fixation of the origin node are imposed as linear constraints on the nodal DOFs. A total of $12$ scalar constraints are defined:\n- $6$ constraints for right-left periodicity on $3$ node pairs. For each pair $(i, j)$, $u_i - u_j = E \\Delta X$.\n- $4$ constraints for top-bottom periodicity on $2$ node pairs.\n- $2$ constraints for fixing the displacement at the origin, $u_0 = 0$.\n\nThese constraints can be written in the matrix form $C U = d$. To solve the system $K U = 0$ subject to these constraints, we employ the method of Lagrange multipliers, which results in the augmented saddle-point system:\n$$\n\\begin{bmatrix} K  C^T \\\\ C  0 \\end{bmatrix}\n\\begin{Bmatrix} U \\\\ \\Lambda \\end{Bmatrix} =\n\\begin{Bmatrix} 0 \\\\ d \\end{Bmatrix}\n$$\nwhere $\\Lambda$ is the vector of Lagrange multipliers. This $30 \\times 30$ system is solved for the global displacement vector $U$ and the multipliers $\\Lambda$.\n\n**5. Stress Averaging**\nWith the nodal displacements $U$ determined, the strain and stress fields can be calculated within each element. The volume-averaged stress $\\Sigma$, which represents the macroscopic stress response, is computed by numerically integrating the stress over the RVE:\n$$\n\\Sigma = \\frac{1}{|\\Omega|} \\sum_{e=1}^{N_{el}} \\int_{\\Omega_e} \\sigma(x) \\, d\\Omega = \\sum_{e=1}^{4} \\sum_{q=1}^{4} \\sigma^{(e)}(x_q) \\, w_q \\, \\det J^{(e)}(x_q)\n$$\nHere, $|\\Omega|=1$, the sum is over all elements $e$ and all Gauss points $q$ within each element. $\\sigma^{(e)}(x_q) = D^e B(x_q) u^e$ is the stress at a Gauss point, $w_q=1$ is the quadrature weight, and $\\det J^{(e)}$ is the determinant of the Jacobian matrix of the isoparametric mapping. The mapping is from a $2 \\times 2$ parent element to a $0.5 \\times 0.5$ physical element. The Jacobian's determinant is therefore constant for each element and equals the ratio of the areas: $\\det J^{(e)} = \\text{Area}_{\\text{physical}} / \\text{Area}_{\\text{parent}} = (0.5 \\times 0.5) / (2 \\times 2) = 0.25 / 4 = 0.0625$. The computed components $[\\Sigma_{xx}, \\Sigma_{yy}, \\Sigma_{xy}]$ for each test case are then collected.\n\nThe entire procedure is implemented in Python using the NumPy library for numerical computations.", "answer": "```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves the computational homogenization problem for five test cases.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    test_cases = [\n        # Test 1 (homogeneous reference)\n        {'E_A': 70e9, 'nu_A': 0.33, 'E_B': 70e9, 'nu_B': 0.33,\n         'E_macro': np.array([[0.001, 0.0002], [0.0002, -0.0005]])},\n        # Test 2 (stiffness contrast under mixed strain)\n        {'E_A': 70e9, 'nu_A': 0.33, 'E_B': 210e9, 'nu_B': 0.30,\n         'E_macro': np.array([[0.001, 0.0002], [0.0002, -0.0005]])},\n        # Test 3 (pure shear)\n        {'E_A': 70e9, 'nu_A': 0.33, 'E_B': 210e9, 'nu_B': 0.30,\n         'E_macro': np.array([[0, 0.001], [0.001, 0]])},\n        # Test 4 (zero macro strain edge case)\n        {'E_A': 70e9, 'nu_A': 0.33, 'E_B': 210e9, 'nu_B': 0.30,\n         'E_macro': np.array([[0, 0], [0, 0]])},\n        # Test 5 (near-incompressible contrast under equi-biaxial strain)\n        {'E_A': 2e9, 'nu_A': 0.49, 'E_B': 70e9, 'nu_B': 0.30,\n         'E_macro': np.array([[0.001, 0], [0, 0.001]])},\n    ]\n\n    results = []\n    for case in test_cases:\n        stress_avg = run_fem_homogenization(case['E_A'], case['nu_A'], case['E_B'], case['nu_B'], case['E_macro'])\n        results.extend(np.round(stress_avg, 6))\n    \n    # Format the final output string exactly as required\n    print(f\"[{','.join(f'{x:.6f}' for x in results)}]\")\n\ndef run_fem_homogenization(E_A, nu_A, E_B, nu_B, E_macro):\n    \"\"\"\n    Performs a single FEM analysis for a given set of material properties and macro strain.\n    \"\"\"\n    # 1.

Define the boundary layer thickness $\\delta$ as the $1/e$ decay length of the first nontrivial Fourier mode, i.e., $\\delta=1/\\kappa_1$.\n\n- Consider three boundary condition idealizations used in first-order computational homogenization: Kinematically Uniform Boundary Conditions (KUBC), Static Uniform Boundary Conditions (SUBC), and Periodic Boundary Conditions (PBC).\n  - For KUBC on a finite strip $[0,L]\\times[0,1]$ with periodicity in $y$, impose $w(0,y)=0$ and $w(L,y)=\\bar{\\gamma}\\,L$.\n  - For SUBC on the same strip, impose a uniform macroscopic traction at $x=0$ equal to $\\bar{t}=\\bar{\\sigma}=\\bar{\\mu}\\,\\bar{\\gamma}$, where $\\bar{\\mu}$ is the volume average of $\\mu(y)$, i.e., the arithmetic mean, and anchor the displacement by $w(L,y)=\\bar{\\gamma}\\,L$ to set the macroscopic shear across the strip; enforce periodicity in $y$. This boundary condition induces a $y$-dependent mismatch of local tractions versus local moduli at $x=0$, which relaxes into the bulk as a boundary layer.\n  - For PBC on a periodic cell, enforce $w$ to be periodic in both $x$ and $y$ up to the macroscopic linear part $\\bar{\\gamma}\\,x$.\n\n- Use the homogenized anisotropic medium and a single-mode approximation of the induced fluctuation field under SUBC to obtain a closed-form expression for the apparent shear modulus $C_{11}^{\\text{app}}$ of the finite strip under each boundary condition, defined by energy equivalence at fixed macroscopic shear $\\bar{\\gamma}$:\n  $$C_{11}^{\\text{app}}=\\frac{2\\,\\mathcal{E}}{\\bar{\\gamma}^2\\,L},$$\n  where $\\mathcal{E}$ is the total stored energy on $[0,L]\\times[0,1]$ of the anisotropic homogenized medium evaluated for the corresponding boundary condition. Show that for KUBC and PBC one has $C_{11}^{\\text{app}}=C_{11}$, while for SUBC the boundary layer yields\n  $$C_{11}^{\\text{app}}=C_{11}\\left[1+\\frac{a_1^2}{2\\,\\kappa_1\\,L}\\left(1-e^{-2\\kappa_1 L}\\right)\\right],$$\n  where $a_1$ is the dimensionless amplitude of the first cosine Fourier coefficient of the normalized traction mismatch at $x=0$, given by\n  $$a_1=\\frac{2}{\\bar{\\gamma}}\\int_0^1\\left(\\frac{\\bar{\\mu}}{\\mu(y)}-1\\right)\\cos\\left(2\\pi y\\right)\\,dy,$$\n  with $\\bar{\\mu}=f\\,\\mu_1+(1-f)\\,\\mu_2$.\n\n- Provide an explicit, algorithmically evaluable expression for $a_1$ in terms of $\\mu_1,\\mu_2,f$ for the bilayer specified above.\n\nImplement a program that, for each test case below, computes and outputs:\n- The boundary layer thickness $\\delta$.\n- The apparent shear modulus under KUBC, $C_{11}^{\\text{app,KUBC}}$.\n- The apparent shear modulus under SUBC, $C_{11}^{\\text{app,SUBC}}$.\n- The apparent shear modulus under PBC, $C_{11}^{\\text{app,PBC}}$.\n\nUse the single-mode approximation described above. All quantities are nondimensional. Your program must aggregate results for all test cases into a single line printed as a JSON-like list of lists in the order $[\\delta, C_{11}^{\\text{app,KUBC}}, C_{11}^{\\text{app,SUBC}}, C_{11}^{\\text{app,PBC}}]$ for each test case, with each floating-point number rounded to six digits after the decimal point.\n\nTest suite (each tuple is $(\\mu_1,\\mu_2,f,L,\\bar{\\gamma})$):\n- Test $1$: $(1.0,50.0,0.3,5.0,0.02)$\n- Test $2$: $(1.0,1.0,0.5,2.0,0.01)$\n- Test $3$: $(0.1,100.0,0.8,3.0,0.05)$\n- Test $4$: $(1.0,100.0,0.5,0.25,0.02)$\n\nFinal output format: Your program should produce a single line containing the results as a comma-separated list of lists enclosed in square brackets, e.g., $[[r_{11},r_{12},r_{13},r_{14}],[r_{21},r_{22},r_{23},r_{24}],\\dots]$, where $r_{ij}$ are the computed floats rounded as specified.", "solution": "We begin with anti-plane elasticity in a laminate characterized by a scalar shear modulus field $\\mu(y)$. The out-of-plane displacement $w(x,y)$ satisfies the equilibrium equation derived from stationarity of the energy\n$$\\mathcal{E}[w]=\\frac{1}{2}\\int_{\\Omega}\\mu(y)\\left(|\\partial_x w|^2+|\\partial_y w|^2\\right)\\,dx\\,dy,$$\nwhich yields\n$$\\partial_x\\!\\left(\\mu(y)\\,\\partial_x w\\right)+\\partial_y\\!\\left(\\mu(y)\\,\\partial_y w\\right)=0.$$\nWe are interested in long-wavelength features along $y$ relative to the period. Classical homogenization for scalar diffusion (or anti-plane shear) in a layered medium that varies in $y$ only leads to an effective homogeneous but anisotropic medium with effective tensor $\\mathbf{C}^{\\ast}=\\mathrm{diag}(C_{11},C_{22})$ acting on the gradient of $w$ in the energy density:\n$$\\mathcal{E}^{\\ast}[w]=\\frac{1}{2}\\int_{\\Omega}\\left(C_{11}\\,|\\partial_x w|^2+C_{22}\\,|\\partial_y w|^2\\right)\\,dx\\,dy.$$\nThe effective moduli follow from series/parallel mixture arguments (or standard cell problems) because transport in the $x$-direction is parallel to the layers while transport in the $y$-direction is perpendicular to the layers. Thus,\n$$C_{11}=\\langle \\mu\\rangle = \\int_0^1 \\mu(y)\\,dy = f\\,\\mu_1+(1-f)\\,\\mu_2,$$\n$$C_{22}=\\left\\langle \\frac{1}{\\mu}\\right\\rangle^{-1}=\\left(\\int_0^1 \\frac{1}{\\mu(y)}\\,dy\\right)^{-1}=\\left(\\frac{f}{\\mu_1}+\\frac{1-f}{\\mu_2}\\right)^{-1}.$$\nTo assess boundary layers, we consider a semi-infinite strip with a small-amplitude, $y$-periodic perturbation at $x=0$. In the homogenized medium, the equilibrium equation becomes\n$$C_{11}\\,\\partial_{xx} w + C_{22}\\,\\partial_{yy} w = 0.$$\nSeeking separable solutions for the fluctuation part of the displacement of the form $w^{\\prime}(x,y)=A_n\\,e^{-\\kappa_n x}\\cos(k_n y)$ with $k_n=2\\pi n$, we obtain\n$$C_{11}\\,\\kappa_n^2 = C_{22}\\,k_n^2 \\quad\\Rightarrow\\quad \\kappa_n = |k_n|\\sqrt{\\frac{C_{22}}{C_{11}}}.$$\nThe $1/e$ decay length of the first nontrivial Fourier mode $n=1$ is\n$$\\delta=\\frac{1}{\\kappa_1}=\\frac{1}{2\\pi}\\sqrt{\\frac{C_{11}}{C_{22}}}.$$\nThis $\\delta$ serves as a quantitative measure of boundary layer thickness.\n\nWe next characterize the boundary conditions. For Kinematically Uniform Boundary Conditions (KUBC), the strip $[0,L]\\times[0,1]$ with periodicity in $y$ is assigned $w(0,y)=0$ and $w(L,y)=\\bar{\\gamma}\\,L$. In the homogenized medium, the unique energy-minimizing solution is $w(x,y)=\\bar{\\gamma}\\,x$, which implies no fluctuation and therefore no boundary layer. For Periodic Boundary Conditions (PBC), a periodic cell with fluctuation periodicity in $x$ and $y$ under macroscopic $w=\\bar{\\gamma}\\,x$ also supports the uniform solution with zero fluctuation. In both cases, the apparent modulus equals $C_{11}$.\n\nFor Static Uniform Boundary Conditions (SUBC), we impose a uniform macroscopic traction $\\bar{t}$ at $x=0$ equal to the macroscopic stress $\\bar{\\sigma}=\\bar{\\mu}\\,\\bar{\\gamma}$, where $\\bar{\\mu}=C_{11}$ is the arithmetic mean. At $x=L$, we impose $w(L,y)=\\bar{\\gamma}\\,L$ to set the macroscopic shear across the strip and ensure well-posedness. At $x=0$, the local traction is $t(0,y)=C_{11}\\,\\partial_x w(0,y)\\equiv \\bar{t}$ in the homogenized description; in the underlying heterogeneous description, this corresponds to a normalized mismatch in local gradient because the actual microscopic traction would be $\\mu(y)\\,\\partial_x w$. To encode the effect of this mismatch while working in the homogenized framework, we prescribe the initial condition for the fluctuation in the $x$-gradient at $x=0$ via its Fourier series. Define the normalized mismatch function\n$$r(y)=\\frac{\\bar{\\mu}}{\\mu(y)}-1,$$\nso that the fluctuation in $x$-gradient at $x=0$ is $\\delta(\\partial_x w)(0,y)=\\bar{\\gamma}\\,r(y)$. The first cosine Fourier coefficient $a_1$ of $r(y)$ is\n$$a_1=\\frac{2}{\\bar{\\gamma}}\\int_{0}^{1}\\delta(\\partial_x w)(0,y)\\,\\cos(2\\pi y)\\,dy=2\\int_{0}^{1}r(y)\\,\\cos(2\\pi y)\\,dy.$$\nFor the bilayer with $\\mu(y)=\\mu_1$ on $y\\in[0,f)$ and $\\mu(y)=\\mu_2$ on $y\\in[f,1)$, we compute $a_1$ explicitly:\n\\begin{align*}\na_1=2\\left[\\int_{0}^{f}\\left(\\frac{\\bar{\\mu}}{\\mu_1}-1\\right)\\cos(2\\pi y)\\,dy+\\int_{f}^{1}\\left(\\frac{\\bar{\\mu}}{\\mu_2}-1\\right)\\cos(2\\pi y)\\,dy\\right]\\\\\n=2\\left[\\left(\\frac{\\bar{\\mu}}{\\mu_1}-1\\right)\\frac{\\sin(2\\pi f)}{2\\pi}+\\left(\\frac{\\bar{\\mu}}{\\mu_2}-1\\right)\\left(0-\\frac{\\sin(2\\pi f)}{2\\pi}\\right)\\right]\\\\\n=\\frac{\\sin(2\\pi f)}{\\pi}\\,\\bar{\\mu}\\left(\\frac{1}{\\mu_1}-\\frac{1}{\\mu_2}\\right).\n\\end{align*}\nUnder the homogenized anisotropic equation, the fluctuation with the first mode evolves as\n$$\\delta(\\partial_x w)(x,y)=\\bar{\\gamma}\\,a_1\\,e^{-\\kappa_1 x}\\cos(2\\pi y),\\qquad \\partial_y w(x,y)=\\bar{\\gamma}\\,a_1\\,\\frac{k_1}{\\kappa_1}\\,e^{-\\kappa_1 x}\\sin(2\\pi y),$$\nwhere the relation between the two follows from the separation ansatz. The extra energy due to the boundary layer beyond the baseline uniform solution is\n\\begin{align*}\n\\Delta \\mathcal{E} = \\frac{1}{2}\\int_{0}^{L}\\int_{0}^{1}\\left[C_{11}\\left(\\delta(\\partial_x w)\\right)^2 + C_{22}\\left(\\partial_y w\\right)^2\\right]\\,dy\\,dx\\\\\n=\\frac{1}{2}\\int_{0}^{L}\\left[C_{11}\\left(\\bar{\\gamma}^2 a_1^2 e^{-2\\kappa_1 x}\\left\\langle \\cos^2(2\\pi y)\\right\\rangle\\right)+ C_{22}\\left(\\bar{\\gamma}^2 a_1^2 \\left(\\frac{k_1}{\\kappa_1}\\right)^2 e^{-2\\kappa_1 x}\\left\\langle \\sin^2(2\\pi y)\\right\\rangle\\right)\\right]dx\\\\\n=\\frac{1}{2}\\int_{0}^{L}\\left[C_{11}\\,\\bar{\\gamma}^2 a_1^2 e^{-2\\kappa_1 x}\\frac{1}{2}+ C_{22}\\,\\bar{\\gamma}^2 a_1^2 \\left(\\frac{k_1}{\\kappa_1}\\right)^2 e^{-2\\kappa_1 x}\\frac{1}{2}\\right]dx\\\\\n=\\frac{1}{4}\\bar{\\gamma}^2 a_1^2 \\int_{0}^{L} e^{-2\\kappa_1 x}\\left(C_{11}+C_{22}\\frac{k_1^2}{\\kappa_1^2}\\right)\\,dx.\n\\end{align*}\nUsing the dispersion relation $C_{11}\\kappa_1^2=C_{22}k_1^2$, we obtain $C_{22}\\,k_1^2/\\kappa_1^2=C_{11}$, and the bracket equals $2C_{11}$. Therefore,\n$$\\Delta \\mathcal{E}=\\frac{1}{4}\\bar{\\gamma}^2 a_1^2\\cdot 2C_{11}\\int_{0}^{L} e^{-2\\kappa_1 x}\\,dx=\\frac{C_{11}\\,\\bar{\\gamma}^2\\,a_1^2}{2}\\cdot \\frac{1-e^{-2\\kappa_1 L}}{2\\kappa_1}.$$\nThe baseline uniform energy is $\\mathcal{E}_0=\\dfrac{1}{2}\\int_0^L\\int_0^1 C_{11}\\,\\bar{\\gamma}^2\\,dy\\,dx=\\dfrac{1}{2}C_{11}\\,\\bar{\\gamma}^2\\,L$. Hence, under SUBC, the apparent modulus defined by $C_{11}^{\\text{app}}=\\dfrac{2(\\mathcal{E}_0+\\Delta \\mathcal{E})}{\\bar{\\gamma}^2\\,L}$ is\n\\begin{align*}\nC_{11}^{\\text{app,SUBC}}=\\frac{2}{\\bar{\\gamma}^2 L}\\left(\\frac{1}{2}C_{11}\\,\\bar{\\gamma}^2\\,L+\\frac{C_{11}\\,\\bar{\\gamma}^2\\,a_1^2}{2}\\cdot \\frac{1-e^{-2\\kappa_1 L}}{2\\kappa_1}\\right)\\\\\n=C_{11}\\left[1+\\frac{a_1^2}{2\\,\\kappa_1\\,L}\\left(1-e^{-2\\kappa_1 L}\\right)\\right].\n\\end{align*}\nFor KUBC and PBC, the solution is uniformly $w=\\bar{\\gamma}\\,x$, thus $C_{11}^{\\text{app,KUBC}}=C_{11}^{\\text{app,PBC}}=C_{11}$.\n\nAlgorithmic summary for each test case $(\\mu_1,\\mu_2,f,L,\\bar{\\gamma})$:\n- Compute $C_{11}=f\\,\\mu_1+(1-f)\\,\\mu_2$.\n- Compute $C_{22}=\\left(\\dfrac{f}{\\mu_1}+\\dfrac{1-f}{\\mu_2}\\right)^{-1}$.\n- Compute $\\kappa_1=2\\pi\\sqrt{C_{22}/C_{11}}$, then $\\delta=1/\\kappa_1=\\dfrac{1}{2\\pi}\\sqrt{C_{11}/C_{22}}$.\n- Compute $a_1=\\dfrac{\\sin(2\\pi f)}{\\pi}\\,C_{11}\\left(\\dfrac{1}{\\mu_1}-\\dfrac{1}{\\mu_2}\\right)$.\n- Compute $C_{11}^{\\text{app,KUBC}}=C_{11}$ and $C_{11}^{\\text{app,PBC}}=C_{11}$.\n- Compute $C_{11}^{\\text{app,SUBC}}=C_{11}\\left[1+\\dfrac{a_1^2}{2\\,\\kappa_1\\,L}\\left(1-e^{-2\\kappa_1 L}\\right)\\right]$.\n\nNumerical considerations: All quantities are nondimensional and positive for $\\mu_1,\\mu_20$ and $f\\in(0,1)$. The expression for $a_1$ vanishes when $\\mu_1=\\mu_2$ or $f\\in\\{0,1\\}$, in which cases $C_{11}^{\\text{app,SUBC}}=C_{11}$. The boundary layer thickness $\\delta$ depends only on the ratio $C_{11}/C_{22}$ and equals the geometric mean of the arithmetic and harmonic means scaled by $1/(2\\pi)$. The results can be computed robustly using standard floating-point arithmetic.\n\nThe final program implements these steps for the specified test suite and prints a single line containing the list of results, each result being a list $[\\delta, C_{11}^{\\text{app,KUBC}}, C_{11}^{\\text{app,SUBC}}, C_{11}^{\\text{app,PBC}}]$ with each entry rounded to six decimal places.", "answer": "```python\n# The complete and runnable Python 3 code goes here.\n# Imports must adhere to the specified execution environment.\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef compute_results(mu1, mu2, f, L, gamma_bar):\n    # Effective moduli of homogenized anisotropic anti-plane medium\n    C11 = f * mu1 + (1.0 - f) * mu2  # arithmetic mean\n    C22 = 1.0 / (f / mu1 + (1.0 - f) / mu2)  # harmonic mean\n\n    # Decay rate and boundary layer thickness for first Fourier mode\n    k1 = 2.0 * np.pi\n    if C11 > 0 and C22 > 0:\n        kappa1 = k1 * np.sqrt(C22 / C11)\n        delta = 1.0 / kappa1\n    else: # Handle edge cases like zero modulus\n        kappa1 = 0\n        delta = float('inf')\n\n    # First cosine coefficient of normalized traction mismatch\n    # a1 = (sin(2*pi*f)/pi) * C11 * (1/mu1 - 1/mu2)\n    if mu1 > 0 and mu2 > 0:\n      a1 = (np.sin(2.0 * np.pi * f) / np.pi) * C11 * (1.0 / mu1 - 1.0 / mu2)\n    else:\n      a1 = 0.0\n\n    # Apparent modulus under KUBC and PBC\n    C11_app_KUBC = C11\n    C11_app_PBC = C11\n\n    # Apparent modulus under SUBC with single-mode boundary layer correction\n    if L > 0 and kappa1 > 1e-9: # Avoid division by zero\n        correction_factor = (a1 ** 2) * (1.0 - np.exp(-2.0 * kappa1 * L)) / (2.0 * kappa1 * L)\n    else:\n        correction_factor = 0.0\n    C11_app_SUBC = C11 * (1.0 + correction_factor)\n\n    return [delta, C11_app_KUBC, C11_app_SUBC, C11_app_PBC]\n\ndef solve():\n    # Define the test cases from the problem statement: (mu1, mu2, f, L, gamma_bar)\n    test_cases = [\n        (1.0, 50.0, 0.3, 5.0, 0.02),\n        (1.0, 1.0, 0.5, 2.0, 0.01),\n        (0.1, 100.0, 0.8, 3.0, 0.05),\n        (1.0, 100.0, 0.5, 0.25, 0.02),\n    ]\n\n    results = []\n    for mu1, mu2, f, L, gamma_bar in test_cases:\n        res = compute_results(mu1, mu2, f, L, gamma_bar)\n        # Round to six decimal places as required\n        res_rounded = [float(f\"{x:.6f}\") for x in res]\n        results.append(res_rounded)\n\n    # Format output as a single-line JSON-like list with no spaces\n    # Convert to string manually to ensure no spaces\n    def list_to_str(lst):\n        return \"[\" + \",\".join(f\"{x:.6f}\" for x in lst) + \"]\"\n    output = \"[\" + \",\".join(list_to_str(r) for r in results) + \"]\"\n    print(output)\n\nsolve()\n```", "id": "2664005"}]}
