The Cauchy stress tensor for uniaxial tension along the direction of the unit vector $e_1$ is given as $\\sigma = \\sigma_0 e_1 \\otimes e_1$, where $\\sigma_0 > 0$ for tension. A slip system is defined by a pair of orthonormal vectors: the slip plane unit normal, $n$, and the slip direction unit vector, $s$, which lies in the slip plane. These vectors are subject to the constraints $|n|=1$, $|s|=1$, and $s \\cdot n = 0$.\n\nThe resolved shear stress, $\\tau$, on this slip system is defined as the projection of the traction vector $t=\\sigma n$ onto the slip direction $s$.\n$$ \\tau = s \\cdot t = s \\cdot (\\sigma n) $$\nSubstituting the expression for the stress tensor $\\sigma$:\n$$ \\tau = s \\cdot ((\\sigma_0 e_1 \\otimes e_1) n) $$\nUsing the property of the tensor product $(a \\otimes b) c = (b \\cdot c) a$, we have:\n$$ (\\sigma_0 e_1 \\otimes e_1) n = \\sigma_0 (e_1 \\cdot n) e_1 $$\nSubstituting this back into the expression for $\\tau$ yields:\n$$ \\tau = s \\cdot (\\sigma_0 (e_1 \\cdot n) e_1) = \\sigma_0 (s \\cdot e_1) (n \\cdot e_1) $$\nThe Schmid factor, $m$, is defined as $m = \\tau / \\sigma_0$, thus:\n$$ m = (s \\cdot e_1) (n \\cdot e_1) $$\nTo find the maximum Schmid factor, we must maximize this expression over all possible orientations of the slip system vectors $n$ and $s$, subject to the constraints $|n|=1$, $|s|=1$, and $s \\cdot n = 0$. The problem states that we must consider all possible crystal orientations. This implies that the pair $(n, s)$ can adopt any orientation in space, as long as a corresponding crystal orientation exists that aligns one of its intrinsic slip systems with this spatial orientation. We will first solve the general geometric optimization problem and then verify its attainability for an FCC crystal.\n\nLet $\\phi$ be the angle between the tensile axis $e_1$ and the slip plane normal $n$, and let $\\lambda$ be the angle between $e_1$ and the slip direction $s$. Both angles are measured in radians. Since $e_1$, $n$, and $s$ are unit vectors, we have:\n$$ n \\cdot e_1 = |n| |e_1| \\cos\\phi = \\cos\\phi $$\n$$ s \\cdot e_1 = |s| |e_1| \\cos\\lambda = \\cos\\lambda $$\nThe Schmid factor is then $m = \\cos\\phi \\cos\\lambda$. Our task is to maximize this function subject to the constraint $s \\cdot n = 0$.\n\nLet us fix the vector $n$ (and thus the angle $\\phi$). We must now find the orientation of the vector $s$ that maximizes $m$. The vector $s$ must be a unit vector lying in the plane perpendicular to $n$. We wish to maximize the term $s \\cdot e_1 = \\cos\\lambda$. Geometrically, this is maximized when $s$ is chosen to be as closely aligned as possible with $e_1$. The vector $s$ is constrained to the slip plane. Therefore, the optimal choice for $s$ is the unit vector in the slip plane that is aligned with the projection of the tensile axis $e_1$ onto that plane.\n\nLet us denote the projection of $e_1$ onto the slip plane as $e_{1,proj}$. This projection is given by $e_{1,proj} = e_1 - (e_1 \\cdot n) n$. The optimal slip direction $s$ is parallel to this projection: $s = \\frac{e_{1,proj}}{|e_{1,proj}|}$. The magnitude of the projection is $|e_{1,proj}| = \\sqrt{|e_1|^2 - (e_1 \\cdot n)^2} = \\sqrt{1 - \\cos^2\\phi} = |\\sin\\phi|$. Assuming $\\phi \\in [0, \\pi/2]$, this is $\\sin\\phi$. For this optimal choice of $s$, the three vectors $e_1$, $n$, and $s$ are coplanar. The angle between $s$ and $n$ is $\\pi/2$. The angle between $e_1$ and $n$ is $\\phi$. Therefore, the angle $\\lambda$ between $e_1$ and $s$ must be $\\lambda = |\\pi/2 - \\phi|$. For $\\phi \\in [0, \\pi/2]$, this is $\\lambda = \\pi/2 - \\phi$.\n\nWith this relationship, we can express the Schmid factor as a function of the single variable $\\phi$:\n$$ m(\\phi) = \\cos\\phi \\cos(\\pi/2 - \\phi) = \\cos\\phi \\sin\\phi $$\nTo find the maximum value of $m(\\phi)$, we can rewrite it as $m(\\phi) = \\frac{1}{2} \\sin(2\\phi)$. The sine function has a maximum value of $1$. Thus, the maximum value of $m$ is attained when $\\sin(2\\phi) = 1$. This occurs when $2\\phi = \\pi/2$, which implies $\\phi = \\pi/4$.\nAt this optimal angle, the value of the Schmid factor is:\n$$ m_{\\max} = \\frac{1}{2} \\sin(2 \\cdot \\pi/4) = \\frac{1}{2} \\sin(\\pi/2) = \\frac{1}{2} $$\nThe corresponding angle $\\lambda$ is $\\lambda = \\pi/2 - \\phi = \\pi/2 - \\pi/4 = \\pi/4$. This demonstrates that the absolute maximum value of the Schmid factor, under the purely geometric constraints, is $1/2$. This maximum is achieved when the tensile axis is oriented at an angle of $\\pi/4$ radians ($45^\\circ$) to both the slip plane normal and the slip direction.\n\nNow, we must address why this maximum is achievable for an FCC crystal. The slip systems in FCC crystals belong to the $\\{111\\}\\langle 110\\rangle$ family. The fact that the crystal orientation is allowed to vary means we can orient the crystal lattice in any manner relative to the fixed tensile axis $e_1$. This is equivalent to fixing the crystal lattice axes and searching for a direction of the tensile axis $T_{cryst}$ in the crystal's coordinate system such that the geometric conditions for maximum Schmid factor are met for one of the crystal's intrinsic slip systems.\n\nLet's select a specific FCC slip system. For instance, the plane $(111)$ and the direction $[\\bar{1}10]$. In the crystal's orthonormal basis, the corresponding unit vectors are:\n$$ n_{cryst} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}}(1, 1, 1) $$\n$$ s_{cryst} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(-1, 1, 0) $$\nOne can verify that $n_{cryst} \\cdot s_{cryst} = 0$. Let the tensile axis in this crystal frame be $T_{cryst} = (t_1, t_2, t_3)$, which must be a unit vector, so $t_1^2 + t_2^2 + t_3^2 = 1$. For the Schmid factor to be maximal, we require the angles $\\phi$ and $\\lambda$ to both be $\\pi/4$. This translates to the following conditions:\n$$ n_{cryst} \\cdot T_{cryst} = \\cos(\\pi/4) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} $$\n$$ s_{cryst} \\cdot T_{cryst} = \\cos(\\pi/4) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} $$\nSubstituting the expressions for $n_{cryst}$ and $s_{cryst}$:\n$$ \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}}(t_1 + t_2 + t_3) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\implies t_1 + t_2 + t_3 = \\sqrt{\\frac{3}{2}} $$\n$$ \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(-t_1 + t_2) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\implies -t_1 + t_2 = 1 $$\nWe now have a system of three equations for the three unknowns $t_1, t_2, t_3$. As demonstrated in the thought process, this system has a unique, real solution for $(t_1, t_2, t_3)$ that satisfies the unit vector constraint $t_1^2 + t_2^2 + t_3^2 = 1$. The existence of such a direction $T_{cryst}$ proves that it is possible to orient an FCC crystal relative to the tensile axis such that one of its slip systems experiences the maximum possible resolved shear stress.\n\nTherefore, the restriction to FCC slip systems does not reduce the maximum achievable Schmid factor from its absolute geometric limit of $1/2$, because the freedom to vary the crystal orientation provides sufficient degrees of freedom to satisfy the optimal geometric conditions.\n\nThe maximal Schmid factor is $m_{\\max} = 1/2$. The corresponding maximal resolved shear stress, $\\tau_{\\max}$, is obtained from its definition:\n$$ \\tau_{\\max} = m_{\\max} \\sigma_0 = \\frac{1}{2} \\sigma_0 $$\n\nThe final answer consists of the maximal Schmid factor $m_{\\max}$ and the maximal resolved shear stress $\\tau_{\\max}$.", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{ \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{1}{2} & \\frac{\\sigma_0}{2} \\end{pmatrix} } $$", "id": "2678663"}, {"introduction": "Once slip begins, a crystal's resistance to further deformation evolves—a phenomenon known as hardening.

The deformation gradient obeys $\\dot{F} = L F$ with $L$ the spatial velocity gradient. The crystal plasticity kinematics postulate $F = F^e F^p$ with $F^p$ mapping the reference to the intermediate lattice configuration and $F^e$ mapping to the current configuration. The plastic velocity gradient is $L^p = \\dot{F}^p \\left(F^p\\right)^{-1}$ and, when expressed in the lattice frame, is modeled as $L^p = \\sum_{\\alpha=1}^{N_s} \\dot{\\gamma}^\\alpha S^\\alpha$, where $S^\\alpha$ are constant lattice-frame Schmid tensors.\n\nThe elastic response is hyperelastic with a stored-energy function $W(C^e)$ and the elastic second Piola–Kirchhoff stress $S^e = 2 \\partial W / \\partial C^e$. In finite-strain crystal plasticity, plastic work in the lattice frame is naturally expressed with the Mandel stress $M = C^e S^e$, which is work-conjugate to the plastic rate $D^p = \\operatorname{sym} L^p$ in the lattice frame. The resolved shear on system $\\alpha$ is $\\tau^\\alpha = M : S^\\alpha$. The rate-dependent law $\\dot{\\gamma}^\\alpha = \\dot{\\gamma}_0 \\left(\\dfrac{|\\tau^\\alpha|}{g^\\alpha}\\right)^m \\operatorname{sign}(\\tau^\\alpha)$ supplies the slip rates.\n\nA consistent time-integration scheme should: \n- perform an elastic predictor by freezing $F^p$ and updating $F^e$ from the known $F$ at the end of the step, \n- evaluate driving stresses in the lattice frame via $M$, \n- perform a viscoplastic corrector that updates $F^p$ through the exponential map of the plastic velocity gradient to respect the multiplicative structure and objectivity, and \n- update the elastic quantities accordingly, including the elastic rotation $R^e$ from the polar decomposition of $F^e$, which defines the crystal orientation. Using the elastic rotation rather than the total rotation is essential because the crystal lattice orientation is determined by the elastic deformation (lattice stretch and rotation), while $F^p$ carries the inelastic shearing that should not reorient the lattice vectors.\n\nThe exponential update $F^p_{n+1} = \\exp\\!\\left(\\int_{t_n}^{t_{n+1}} L^p \\, \\mathrm{d} t\\right) F^p_n$ is the structure-preserving integration of $\\dot{F}^p = L^p F^p$. For first-order accuracy in a backward-Euler sense, one replaces the integral with $\\sum_{\\alpha=1}^{N_s} \\Delta \\gamma^\\alpha S^\\alpha$, where $\\Delta \\gamma^\\alpha$ are slip increments that must satisfy the rate law implicitly, typically solved by Newton iterations. At each corrector iteration, one rebuilds $F^p$, then $F^e = F_{n+1} \\left(F^p\\right)^{-1}$, then refreshes $R^e$ from the polar decomposition $F^e = R^e U^e$, and then recomputes $C^e$, $S^e$, $M$, and $\\tau^\\alpha$ until the residuals $r^\\alpha = \\dfrac{\\Delta \\gamma^\\alpha}{\\Delta t} - \\dot{\\gamma}^\\alpha\\left(\\tau^\\alpha\\right)$ vanish.\n\nWith these principles, we now evaluate each option:\n\nOption A:\n- This option freezes $F^p$ for the elastic predictor, computes $F^{e,\\mathrm{trial}} = F_{n+1} \\left(F^p_n\\right)^{-1}$, and extracts the elastic rotation by polar decomposition. It computes the Mandel stress in terms of $C^e$ and $S^e$, ensuring evaluation of $\\tau^\\alpha$ in the lattice frame. \n- The corrector updates $F^p$ via the exponential map $F^p_{k+1} = \\exp\\!\\left(\\sum_{\\alpha=1}^{N_s} \\Delta \\gamma^\\alpha S^\\alpha\\right) F^p_n$, then updates $F^e$ multiplicatively as $F^e_{k+1} = F_{n+1} \\left(F^p_{k+1}\\right)^{-1}$, and refreshes the elastic rotation by polar decomposition. The residual definition $r^\\alpha = \\dfrac{\\Delta \\gamma^\\alpha}{\\Delta t} - \\dot{\\gamma}^\\alpha\\left(\\tau^\\alpha\\right)$ is consistent with a backward-Euler integration of the rate law. \n- Orientation is updated with the elastic rotation $R^e$ rather than the total rotation, which is consistent with the notion that the lattice orientation is governed by $F^e$.\n- Verdict: Correct.\n\nOption B:\n- Uses the total rotation from the polar decomposition of $F_{n+1}$ to rotate slip systems and computes resolved shears with the spatial Cauchy stress and spatial Schmid tensors. This mixes frames and ignores the lattice pull-back required for $\\tau^\\alpha = M : S^\\alpha$. \n- The plastic update is additive in $F^p$ rather than multiplicative; $F^p_{n+1} = F^p_n + \\sum \\Delta \\gamma^\\alpha S^\\alpha$ does not integrate $\\dot{F}^p = L^p F^p$ correctly and breaks the multiplicative structure and objectivity for finite steps. \n- It keeps $F^e$ fixed to the total polar factors, decoupling $F^e$ from the plastic corrector, which is inconsistent with $F^e = F \\left(F^p\\right)^{-1}$.\n- Orientation is set to the total rotation, not the elastic rotation, which misidentifies the lattice orientation.\n- Verdict: Incorrect.\n\nOption C:\n- Assumes $F^{e,\\mathrm{trial}} = F_{n+1}$ and $F^{p,\\mathrm{trial}} = I$, which disregards the history carried by $F^p_n$ and is inconsistent with the elastic predictor idea that freezes plastic flow, not resets it. \n- Computes resolved shears directly from the Cauchy stress without lattice pull-back, violating the work-conjugacy in the lattice frame. \n- Although it uses an exponential update for $F^p$, it holds $R^e$ fixed as $R^e_n$ during the corrector and updates $F^e$ only once at the end. This prevents consistent recomputation of $M$ and $\\tau^\\alpha$ as $\\Delta \\gamma^\\alpha$ evolve, destroying the implicit coupling needed for the backward-Euler integration.\n- Verdict: Incorrect.\n\nOption D:\n- Begins with a corotational transformation using $R^e_n$, which can be a useful device, but then integrates $F^p$ with a forward-Euler type update $F^p_{n+1} = \\left(I + \\Delta t \\sum \\dot{\\gamma}^\\alpha S^\\alpha\\right) F^p_n$. This linearized update only approximates the exponential map and compromises multiplicativity and objectivity for finite $\\Delta t$. \n- It updates $F^e$ consistently from $F_{n+1}$ and $F^p_{n+1}$, which is good, but then sets the lattice orientation equal to the total rotation from $F_{n+1}$ rather than the elastic rotation from $F^e_{n+1}$, misrepresenting the lattice orientation. \n- Additionally, the resolved shears and stresses are not explicitly guaranteed to be evaluated via the Mandel stress in the lattice frame throughout the corrector.\n- Verdict: Incorrect.\n\nTherefore, the only option that consistently adheres to the kinematics, frame-indifference, lattice-frame flow rule, and structure-preserving updates for $F^p$, $F^e$, and orientation is Option A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2678674"}]}
