The trace of the strain tensor is $\\epsilon_{kk} = \\epsilon_{xx} + \\epsilon_{yy} + \\epsilon_{zz}$.\nTaking the trace of the stress tensor gives:\n$$\n\\sigma_{kk} = \\sigma_{xx} + \\sigma_{yy} + \\sigma_{zz} = (3\\lambda + 2\\mu) \\epsilon_{kk}\n$$\nThus, the hydrostatic stress is directly proportional to the volumetric strain $\\epsilon_{kk}$:\n$$\n\\sigma_H = \\frac{3\\lambda + 2\\mu}{3} \\epsilon_{kk} = K \\epsilon_{kk}\n$$\nwhere $K$ is the bulk modulus.\n\nThe small strain tensor components are defined from the displacement field $\\mathbf{u}$ as:\n$$\n\\epsilon_{ij} = \\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\frac{\\partial u_i}{\\partial x_j} + \\frac{\\partial u_j}{\\partial x_i}\\right)\n$$\nThe problem is specified under plane strain conditions, where, by definition, strains in the $z$-direction are zero: $\\epsilon_{zz} = \\epsilon_{xz} = \\epsilon_{yz} = 0$. The given displacement field, $u_x(x,y)$, $u_y(x,y)$, and $u_z=0$, is consistent with this.\nThe volumetric strain is then $\\epsilon_{kk} = \\epsilon_{xx} + \\epsilon_{yy}$.

The volumetric strain is therefore identically zero:\n$$\n\\epsilon_{kk} = \\epsilon_{xx} + \\epsilon_{yy} + \\epsilon_{zz} = 0\n$$\nThe only non-zero strain components are the shear strains $\\epsilon_{xz}$ and $\\epsilon_{yz}$:\n$$\n\\epsilon_{xz} = \\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\frac{\\partial u_x}{\\partial z} + \\frac{\\partial u_z}{\\partial x}\\right) = \\frac{1}{2} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}\\left(\\frac{b}{2\\pi} \\arctan\\left(\\frac{y}{x}\\right)\\right) = -\\frac{b}{4\\pi} \\frac{y}{x^2+y^2}\n$$\n$$\n\\epsilon_{yz} = \\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\frac{\\partial u_y}{\\partial z} + \\frac{\\partial u_z}{\\partial y}\\right) = \\frac{1}{2} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}\\left(\\frac{b}{2\\pi} \\arctan\\left(\\frac{y}{x}\\right)\\right) = \\frac{b}{4\\pi} \\frac{x}{x^2+y^2}\n$$\nNow we use Hooke's law to find the stress components.

The deformation is purely deviatoric (volume-preserving), meaning the volumetric strain $\\epsilon_{kk}$ is zero everywhere. In an isotropic material, hydrostatic stress is coupled only to volumetric strain. Therefore, a null volumetric strain implies a null hydrostatic stress.

The provided information is sufficient for a full derivation.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\n- The problem is **valid**. A solution will be provided.\n\n**Derivation of Solution**\n\nLet the slip plane be the $xy$-plane. The pinned dislocation segment initially lies along the $x$-axis between $x=-L/2$ and $x=L/2$. Under a resolved shear stress $\\tau$, the dislocation experiences a Peach-Koehler force. The magnitude of this force per unit length is $f_{PK} = \\tau b$. The problem states this force acts normal to the dislocation line. The line tension $\\Gamma$ provides a restoring force that opposes the bowing. For a curved line with local radius of curvature $R$, the restoring force per unit length is $f_{\\Gamma} = \\Gamma/R = \\Gamma \\kappa$, where $\\kappa$ is the curvature.\n\nIn equilibrium, these forces must balance:\n$$f_{PK} = f_{\\Gamma} \\implies \\tau b = \\frac{\\Gamma}{R}$$\nThis implies that the radius of curvature $R$ is constant along the segment:\n$$R = \\frac{\\Gamma}{\\tau b}$$\nA curve with constant curvature is a circular arc.\n\n**1) Equilibrium Bowed Shape $y(x)$**\n\nThe dislocation line segment forms a circular arc passing through the pinning points at $(\\pm L/2, 0)$. By symmetry, the center of the circle must lie on the $y$-axis, at some coordinate $(0, y_c)$. The equation of the circle is $x^2 + (y-y_c)^2 = R^2$.\nSubstituting one of the pinning points, for instance $(L/2, 0)$:\n$$\\left(\\frac{L}{2}\\right)^2 + (0 - y_c)^2 = R^2 \\implies y_c^2 = R^2 - \\frac{L^2}{4}$$\nLet's assume the dislocation bows into the positive $y$-region, so the center of curvature is in the negative $y$-region, $y_c = -\\sqrt{R^2 - L^2/4}$.\nThe equation for the bowed dislocation shape $y(x)$ is the upper part of this circle:\n$$y(x) = y_c + \\sqrt{R^2 - x^2} = -\\sqrt{R^2 - \\frac{L^2}{4}} + \\sqrt{R^2 - x^2}$$\nThis expression satisfies the boundary conditions $y(\\pm L/2) = 0$. Substituting the expression for $R$:\n$$y(x) = \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{\\Gamma}{\\tau b}\\right)^2 - x^2} - \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{\\Gamma}{\\tau b}\\right)^2 - \\frac{L^2}{4}}$$\nThis is the equilibrium shape of the dislocation segment.\n\n**2) Half-Subtended Angle $\\varphi$ and Depinning Condition**\n\nLet us consider the geometry of the circular arc. The half-subtended angle $\\varphi$ is the angle at the center of the circle between the axis of symmetry (the $y$-axis) and the radius to one of the pins. A right-angled triangle is formed by the center $(0, y_c)$, the origin $(0,0)$, and the pin $(L/2, 0)$. The lengths of the sides are $|y_c|$, $L/2$, and the hypotenuse is the radius $R$.\nFrom this triangle, we have:\n$$\\sin(\\varphi) = \\frac{L/2}{R}$$\nSubstituting $R = \\Gamma/(\\tau b)$, we find the dependence of $\\varphi$ on the physical parameters:\n$$\\sin(\\varphi) = \\frac{L/2}{\\Gamma/(\\tau b)} = \\frac{\\tau b L}{2\\Gamma}$$\nDepinning occurs when the stress is high enough that the segment can bypass the obstacles. In this model, this corresponds to the maximum possible bow-out, where the dislocation forms a semicircle of radius $R_{min} = L/2$. For this configuration, the half-suptended angle is $\\varphi = \\pi/2$, and thus $\\sin(\\varphi)=1$. The depinning condition is therefore met when the angle $\\varphi$ reaches $\\pi/2$. This occurs at a critical stress $\\tau_{crit} = 2\\Gamma/(bL)$.\n\n**3) Force on a Pin**\n\nThe problem asks to interpret the force on an obstacle as the resultant of line tension forces from two adjacent arms. This implies a model of a long dislocation line pinned by a series of obstacles. Let us consider one such obstacle (pin). Two symmetric bowed-out arms of the dislocation meet at this pin.\nLet the pin be at the origin and the chord connecting adjacent pins lie on the $x$-axis. The tangent to the left arm at the pin makes an angle $\\varphi_L$ with the positive $x$-axis, and the tangent to the right arm makes an angle $\\varphi_R$. Due to symmetry of bowing, the tangents make an angle with the chord of magnitude $\\varphi$. If the bow-out is in the $+y$ direction, the tangent to the left arm arriving at the pin has an angle related to $\\pi - \\varphi$, and the tangent to the right arm leaving the pin has an angle related to $\\varphi$.\n\nThe force exerted on the pin is the vector sum of the tension forces from each arm. The tension force from an arm pulls the pin towards that arm's segment. Let $\\mathbf{T}_L$ and $\\mathbf{T}_R$ be the tension force vectors from the left and right arms, respectively. The angle between the two tangent vectors at the pin is $\\theta_{total} = (\\pi-\\varphi)-\\varphi = \\pi-2\\varphi$.\nThe resultant force magnitude $F_{pin}$ is given by the vector sum of two forces of magnitude $\\Gamma$ separated by an angle $\\theta_{total}$:\n$$F_{pin} = \\sqrt{\\Gamma^2 + \\Gamma^2 + 2\\Gamma^2 \\cos(\\pi-2\\varphi)} = \\sqrt{2\\Gamma^2(1-\\cos(2\\varphi))}$$\nUsing the identity $1-\\cos(2\\varphi) = 2\\sin^2(\\varphi)$:\n$$F_{pin} = \\sqrt{4\\Gamma^2\\sin^2(\\varphi)} = 2\\Gamma|\\sin(\\varphi)|$$\nSince $\\varphi \\in [0, \\pi/2]$, $\\sin(\\varphi) \\ge 0$. So, the force magnitude is:\n$$F_{pin} = 2\\Gamma\\sin(\\varphi)$$\nThis is the force as a function of $\\varphi$. To express it as a function of $\\Gamma, \\tau, b, L$, we substitute the expression for $\\sin(\\varphi)$ derived in the previous part:\n$$F_{pin} = 2\\Gamma \\left( \\frac{\\tau b L}{2\\Gamma} \\right) = \\tau b L$$\nThis result shows that the force on the pin is equal to the total Peach-Koehler force integrated along the chord length of the segment it supports.\n\n**Maximum Force on a Pin**\n\nFinally, we must compute the maximum possible magnitude of this force. The force on the pin is given by $F_{pin} = 2\\Gamma\\sin(\\varphi)$. This force is maximized when $\\sin(\\varphi)$ is maximized. The physical range for the angle $\\varphi$ is from $0$ (straight dislocation, $\\tau=0$) to $\\pi/2$ (semicircular configuration at the point of depinning). The maximum value of $\\sin(\\varphi)$ over this range is $\\sin(\\pi/2)=1$.\nTherefore, the maximum force on a pin occurs at the depinning condition and is:\n$$F_{pin, max} = 2\\Gamma \\sin(\\pi/2) = 2\\Gamma$$\nThis is the maximum force that the obstacle must withstand to pin the dislocation.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{2\\Gamma}$$", "id": "2630971"}, {"introduction": "In our final practice, we shift from a force-balance perspective to an equivalent and powerful energy-balance approach, applying it to a technologically vital strengthening mechanism.

It is a standard, albeit simplified, problem in materials science that can be solved from first principles as requested. A solution will be derived.\n\n**Derivation of the Critical Resolved Shear Stress**\n\nThe critical condition for the dislocation to shear the precipitate is reached when the work done by the external applied stress, transmitted via the Peach-Koehler force, is equal to the energy required to create the new planar defect surface within the precipitate. We denote the critical resolved shear stress as $\\tau_c$.\n\n$W_{\\mathrm{PK}} = E_{\\mathrm{defect}}$\n\nFirst, we calculate the energy, $E_{\\mathrm{defect}}$, required to create the planar defect. The problem states that the slip plane bisects the spherical precipitate of radius $R$. The resulting intersection is a circle with radius $R$. The area of this defect, $A$, is the area of this circle:\n$$A = \\pi R^2$$\nThe energy per unit area of the defect is $\\gamma$. Thus, the total energy to create the defect is:\n$$E_{\\mathrm{defect}} = \\gamma A = \\gamma \\pi R^2$$\n\nNext, we calculate the work done by the Peach-Koehler force, $W_{\\mathrm{PK}}$, as the dislocation passes through the precipitate. We must strictly adhere to the assumptions provided.\nThe magnitude of the Peach-Koehler force per unit length of the dislocation line is given as $f = \\tau b$.\nThe problem assumes the dislocation line segment interacting with the precipitate is a straight line of length $L$ equal to the diameter of the circular intersection. The diameter of a circle of radius $R$ is $2R$.\n$$L = 2R$$\nThe total force $F$ acting on this segment of the dislocation is the force per unit length multiplied by the length of the segment:\n$$F = f \\cdot L = (\\tau b) \\cdot (2R) = 2\\tau b R$$\nThe problem further assumes that the dislocation advances by a distance $d$ equal to this same diameter.\n$$d = 2R$$\nThe work done, $W_{\\mathrm{PK}}$, is the product of this total force and the distance of advance.\n$$W_{\\mathrm{PK}} = F \\cdot d = (2\\tau b R) \\cdot (2R) = 4\\tau b R^2$$\nThis formulation represents a block-like approximation of the work done.\n\nNow, we equate the work done to the energy cost at the critical stress $\\tau = \\tau_c$:\n$$W_{\\mathrm{PK}} = E_{\\mathrm{defect}}$$\n$$4\\tau_c b R^2 = \\gamma \\pi R^2$$\nWe can solve for the critical resolved shear stress, $\\tau_c$. Note that the term $R^2$ cancels from both sides of the equation. This indicates that, within this simplified model, the critical stress to shear the precipitate is independent of the precipitate's size.\n$$4\\tau_c b = \\gamma \\pi$$\n$$\\tau_c = \\frac{\\pi \\gamma}{4 b}$$\nThis is the derived expression for the critical resolved shear stress based on the problem's stated fundamentals and assumptions.\n\n**Numerical Evaluation of the Minimum Shearing Threshold**\n\nThe problem asks for the minimum shearing threshold. This corresponds to the energetic path of least resistance, which is the creation of the planar defect with the lower energy per unit area, $\\gamma$.\nWe are given:\n$\\gamma_{\\mathrm{APB}} = 0.200\\ \\mathrm{J/m^2}$\n$\\gamma_{\\mathrm{SF}} = 0.120\\ \\mathrm{J/m^2}$\nThe lower value is the stacking fault energy, so we use $\\gamma = \\gamma_{\\mathrm{SF}} = 0.120\\ \\mathrm{J/m^2}$.\nThe Burgers vector magnitude is given as $b = 0.255 \\times 10^{-9}\\ \\mathrm{m}$.\n\nSubstituting these values into the expression for $\\tau_c$:\n$$\\tau_c = \\frac{\\pi \\gamma_{\\mathrm{SF}}}{4 b} = \\frac{\\pi (0.120\\ \\mathrm{J/m^2})}{4 (0.255 \\times 10^{-9}\\ \\mathrm{m})}$$\nThe denominator is $4 \\times (0.255 \\times 10^{-9}\\ \\mathrm{m}) = 1.02 \\times 10^{-9}\\ \\mathrm{m}$.\n$$\\tau_c = \\frac{0.120 \\pi}{1.02 \\times 10^{-9}}\\ \\frac{\\mathrm{J}}{\\mathrm{m^3}}$$\nThe units $\\mathrm{J/m^3}$ are equivalent to $\\mathrm{N/m^2}$ or Pascals ($\\mathrm{Pa}$), which is correct for stress.\n$$\\tau_c = \\frac{0.376991...}{1.02 \\times 10^{-9}}\\ \\mathrm{Pa} \\approx 0.36960 \\times 10^9\\ \\mathrm{Pa}$$\n$$\\tau_c \\approx 3.6960 \\times 10^8\\ \\mathrm{Pa}$$\nTo express the answer in megapascals ($\\mathrm{MPa}$), we use the conversion $1\\ \\mathrm{MPa} = 10^6\\ \\mathrm{Pa}$.\n$$\\tau_c \\approx 369.60\\ \\mathrm{MPa}$$\nRounding to three significant figures, as required by the problem statement:\n$$\\tau_c \\approx 370\\ \\mathrm{MPa}$$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{370}$$", "id": "2630983"}]}
