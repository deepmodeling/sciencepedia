Consequently, these plies also make no contribution to $A_{16}$ and $A_{26}$.\n\nSince the contribution from every ply or pair of plies is zero, the total sum is zero.

The laminate consists of $N$ orthotropic laminae, each with its own orientation angle and thickness. The ultimate goal is to compute specific scalar entries of these global stiffness matrices for a set of test laminates.\n\nStart from the following fundamental base, without using any pre-derived shortcut formulas in the problem statement:\n- Each lamina is modeled as a homogeneous, linearly elastic, orthotropic, plane-stress material.\n- In each lamina’s principal material axes, the two-dimensional stress-strain relation is given by $\\{\\sigma\\} = [Q]\\{\\epsilon\\}$, where $[Q]$ is the reduced stiffness matrix in the lamina axes and $\\{\\sigma\\}$, $\\{\\epsilon\\}$ are the in-plane stress and strain vectors, respectively.\n- The laminate mid-plane is the reference plane at $z = 0$, and the stress resultants per unit width and bending moments per unit width are defined by $\\{N\\} = \\int_{-h/2}^{h/2} \\{\\sigma\\}\\,dz$ and $\\{M\\} = \\int_{-h/2}^{h/2} z\\,\\{\\sigma\\}\\,dz$, where $h$ is the total laminate thickness.\n- Coordinate transformations between lamina axes and laminate axes are performed using proper rotation operators for stress and strain fields under plane stress.\n\nProgram requirements:\n- Your algorithm must assemble $[A]$, $[B]$, and $[D]$ for an arbitrary stacking sequence with variable ply thicknesses and angles, emphasizing numerical stability and unit consistency from first principles. You must implement stable rotation of the reduced stiffness matrix from each ply’s material coordinates to the laminate axes, accumulation of contributions through the thickness using appropriate through-thickness coordinates $z$, and strict unit conversion.\n- All input material moduli must be interpreted in gigapascals ($\\mathrm{GPa}$) and converted to pascals ($\\mathrm{Pa}$). All thicknesses are given in millimetres ($\\mathrm{mm}$) and must be converted to metres ($\\mathrm{m}$). All angles are given in degrees and must be interpreted in degrees (convert internally to radians as needed).\n- The program must output, for each test case, the list $[A_{11}, A_{12}, A_{22}, B_{16}, D_{66}]$ with the following units: $[A]$ in newtons per metre ($\\mathrm{N/m}$), $[B]$ in newtons ($\\mathrm{N}$), and $[D]$ in newton-metre ($\\mathrm{N\\cdot m}$).

It requires the computation of the laminate stiffness matrices $[A]$, $[B]$, and $[D]$ from first principles, based on Classical Lamination Theory (CLT). The provided data, including material properties and laminate stacking sequences, are physically realistic and complete. No scientific or logical flaws are present. Thus, the problem is valid, and a solution is derived as follows.\n\nThe constitutive relation for a laminated composite plate relating stress and moment resultants, $\\{N\\}$ and $\\{M\\}$, to mid-plane strains and curvatures, $\\{\\epsilon^0\\}$ and $\\{\\kappa\\}$, is given by:\n$$\n\\begin{Bmatrix} N \\\\ M \\end{Bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} [A] & [B] \\\\ [B] & [D] \\end{bmatrix} \\begin{Bmatrix} \\epsilon^0 \\\\ \\kappa \\end{Bmatrix}\n$$\nThe matrices $[A]$, $[B]$, and $[D]$ are the extensional, coupling, and bending stiffness matrices, respectively. Our objective is to calculate these matrices for given laminates. The procedure is based on a systematic, layer-by-layer analysis.\n\n**Step 1: Single Lamina Reduced Stiffness Matrix $[Q]$**\n\nEach lamina is an orthotropic material under a state of plane stress. The stress-strain relationship in the lamina's principal material directions (the $1$-$2$ coordinate system) is $\\{\\sigma\\}_{12} = [Q]\\{\\epsilon\\}_{12}$. The matrix $[Q]$ is the reduced stiffness matrix, which is obtained by inverting the reduced compliance matrix $[S]$. The components of $[S]$ are defined by the engineering constants: Young's moduli $E_1$ and $E_2$, shear modulus $G_{12}$, and Poisson's ratio $\\nu_{12}$.\n\nFrom the reciprocity theorem, $\\nu_{12} / E_1 = \\nu_{21} / E_2$, which allows us to find $\\nu_{21} = \\nu_{12} (E_2 / E_1)$. The non-zero elements of the $[Q]$ matrix are then:\n$$\nQ_{11} = \\frac{E_1}{1 - \\nu_{12}\\nu_{21}} \\\\\nQ_{22} = \\frac{E_2}{1 - \\nu_{12}\\nu_{21}} \\\\\nQ_{12} = \\frac{\\nu_{12}E_2}{1 - \\nu_{12}\\nu_{21}} = \\frac{\\nu_{21}E_1}{1 - \\nu_{12}\\nu_{21}} \\\\\nQ_{66} = G_{12}\n$$\nAnd $Q_{16} = Q_{26} = 0$. All input moduli in $\\mathrm{GPa}$ must be converted to $\\mathrm{Pa}$ ($1\\,\\mathrm{GPa} = 10^9\\,\\mathrm{Pa}$).\n\n**Step 2: Transformed Reduced Stiffness Matrix $[\\bar{Q}]$**\n\nEach lamina within the laminate is oriented at a specific angle $\\theta_k$ with respect to the global laminate coordinate system ($x$-$y$). The lamina stiffness matrix must be transformed into this global system. The transformed matrix, $[\\bar{Q}]$, relates stress and strain in the laminate axes: $\\{\\sigma\\}_{xy} = [\\bar{Q}]\\{\\epsilon\\}_{xy}$.\n\nThe transformation is performed using trigonometric functions of the ply angle $\\theta$. The components of $[\\bar{Q}]$ for a ply at angle $\\theta$ can be expressed using the components of $[Q]$ and trigonometric terms, where $c = \\cos\\theta$ and $s = \\sin\\theta$:\n$$\n\\bar{Q}_{11} = Q_{11}c^4 + Q_{22}s^4 + 2(Q_{12} + 2Q_{66})s^2c^2 \\\\\n\\bar{Q}_{22} = Q_{11}s^4 + Q_{22}c^4 + 2(Q_{12} + 2Q_{66})s^2c^2 \\\\\n\\bar{Q}_{12} = (Q_{11} + Q_{22} - 4Q_{66})s^2c^2 + Q_{12}(c^4 + s^4) \\\\\n\\bar{Q}_{66} = (Q_{11} + Q_{22} - 2Q_{12})s^2c^2 + Q_{66}(c^2-s^2)^2 \\\\\n\\bar{Q}_{16} = (Q_{11} - Q_{12} - 2Q_{66})sc^3 - (Q_{22} - Q_{12} - 2Q_{66})s^3c \\\\\n\\bar{Q}_{26} = (Q_{11} - Q_{12} - 2Q_{66})s^3c - (Q_{22} - Q_{12} - 2Q_{66})sc^3\n$$\n\n**Step 3: Laminate Stiffness Matrix Assembly**\n\nThe laminate stiffness matrices $[A]$, $[B]$, and $[D]$ are obtained by integrating the transformed stiffnesses of each ply through the laminate's thickness. The integrals are defined as:\n$$\nA_{ij} = \\int_{-h/2}^{h/2} \\bar{Q}_{ij}(z) \\,dz \\quad , \\quad B_{ij} = \\int_{-h/2}^{h/2} z \\bar{Q}_{ij}(z) \\,dz \\quad , \\quad D_{ij} = \\int_{-h/2}^{h/2} z^2 \\bar{Q}_{ij}(z) \\,dz\n$$\nwhere $z$ is the through-thickness coordinate measured from the laminate mid-plane, and $h$ is the total laminate thickness.\n\nFor a laminate composed of $N$ discrete plies, these integrals become summations over the plies. The coordinate system is defined as follows: the plies are numbered $k=1, 2, \\dots, N$ from the bottom surface to the top surface. The total thickness is $h = \\sum_{k=1}^N h_k$. The laminate bottom surface lies at $z = -h/2$. The z-coordinates of the top and bottom of the $k$-th ply are $z_{k}$ and $z_{k-1}$, where $z_k = -h/2 + \\sum_{j=1}^{k} h_j$.\nThe summations are then:\n$$\nA_{ij} = \\sum_{k=1}^N (\\bar{Q}_{ij})_k (z_k - z_{k-1}) \\\\\nB_{ij} = \\frac{1}{2}\\sum_{k=1}^N (\\bar{Q}_{ij})_k (z_k^2 - z_{k-1}^2) \\\\\nD_{ij} = \\frac{1}{3}\\sum_{k=1}^N (\\bar{Q}_{ij})_k (z_k^3 - z_{k-1}^3)\n$$\nThis summation procedure is performed for all $i,j \\in \\{1,2,6\\}$ to assemble the full $3 \\times 3$ matrices $[A]$, $[B]$, and $[D]$. Finally, the required components ($A_{11}$, $A_{12}$, $A_{22}$, $B_{16}$, $D_{66}$) are extracted. The units of the matrices will be $\\mathrm{N/m}$ for $[A]$, $\\mathrm{N}$ for $[B]$, and $\\mathrm{N \\cdot m}$ for $[D]$, consistent with the use of base SI units ($\\mathrm{Pa}$, $\\mathrm{m}$) in the calculations.
