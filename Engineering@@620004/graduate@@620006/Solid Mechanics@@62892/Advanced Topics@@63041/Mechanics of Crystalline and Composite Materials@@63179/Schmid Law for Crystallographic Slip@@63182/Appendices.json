The resolved shear stress $\\tau_R$ is the scalar projection of the traction vector $\\mathbf{t}$ onto the unit slip direction vector $\\mathbf{s}$: $\\tau_R = \\mathbf{t} \\cdot \\mathbf{s}$.\n\nCombining these steps and substituting the given stress tensor $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}=\\sigma\\,\\mathbf{L}\\otimes\\mathbf{L}$:\n$$ \\tau_R = (\\boldsymbol{\\sigma} \\cdot \\mathbf{n}) \\cdot \\mathbf{s} = ((\\sigma\\,\\mathbf{L}\\otimes\\mathbf{L}) \\cdot \\mathbf{n}) \\cdot \\mathbf{s} $$\nUsing the property of the tensor product $(\\mathbf{a}\\otimes\\mathbf{b})\\cdot\\mathbf{c} = \\mathbf{a}(\\mathbf{b}\\cdot\\mathbf{c})$, we have:\n$$ \\tau_R = (\\sigma\\,\\mathbf{L}(\\mathbf{L}\\cdot\\mathbf{n})) \\cdot \\mathbf{s} = \\sigma (\\mathbf{L}\\cdot\\mathbf{n})(\\mathbf{L}\\cdot\\mathbf{s}) $$\nThe slip condition is $|\\tau_R| \\ge \\tau_c$.

Therefore, slip system S1, $(1\\,1\\,1)[\\bar{1}\\,1\\,0]$, will activate first.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. System $(1\\,\\bar{1}\\,1)[1\\,1\\,0]$ activates first because it has the largest geometric projection; geometry alone determines the onset.**\nThis option refers to system S3. The Schmid factors are $m^{(1)} = \\frac{2}{3\\sqrt{6}} \\approx 0.272$, $m^{(3)} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{6}} \\approx 0.408$, and $m^{(4)} = \\frac{1}{3\\sqrt{6}} \\approx 0.136$. System S3 indeed has the largest Schmid factor (geometric projection). However, the claim that geometry *alone* determines the onset is false. The slip resistance, $\\tau_c$, is crucial. System S3 has the highest activation stress and will activate last among the three candidates.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**B. System $(1\\,1\\,1)[\\bar{1}\\,1\\,0]$ activates first because it minimizes the ratio $\\tau_c/m$ over the listed systems.**\nThis option refers to system S1. As derived above, the first system to activate is the one that possesses the minimum activation stress, $\\sigma_{act} = \\tau_c/m$. Our calculations show $\\sigma_{act}^{(1)} < \\sigma_{act}^{(4)} < \\sigma_{act}^{(3)}$. Thus, system S1 activates first, and the reason provided—that it minimizes the ratio $\\tau_c/m$—is the correct physical principle.\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\n**C. System $(1\\,1\\,\\bar{1})[1\\,\\bar{1}\\,0]$ activates first because it has the smallest $\\tau_c$, regardless of geometric factors.**\nThis option refers to system S4. It correctly notes that $\\tau_c^{(4)} = 50\\,\\mathrm{MPa}$ is the smallest CRSS among the three systems. However, the claim that this is sufficient for activation \"regardless of geometric factors\" is false. System S4 has a very low Schmid factor ($m^{(4)}$), resulting in an activation stress $\\sigma_{act}^{(4)}$ that is higher than that of system S1. The onset of slip depends on the ratio $\\tau_c/m$, not on $\\tau_c$ alone.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. No slip activates until $\\sigma$ reaches $735\\,\\mathrm{MPa}$, at which point $(1\\,\\bar{1}\\,1)[1\\,1\\,0]$ begins to operate because it has the highest geometric factor.**\nThis option refers to system S3. The activation stress for S3 is $\\sigma_{act}^{(3)} = 300\\sqrt{6}\\,\\mathrm{MPa} \\approx 734.8\\,\\mathrm{MPa}$, which is consistent with the stated value of $735\\,\\mathrm{MPa}$. It also correctly notes that S3 has the highest geometric factor. However, it incorrectly asserts that this system activates first. System S1 activates at a much lower stress of $\\approx 220.5\\,\\mathrm{MPa}$.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2683989"}]}
