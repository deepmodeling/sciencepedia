The numerical values are specific, allowing for a unique quantitative answer.\n- **Objective:** The problem statement is formulated with precise, objective language, free of ambiguity, subjectivity, or opinion.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. It is scientifically sound, well-posed, objective, and contains no discernible flaws. A solution will be provided.\n\n**Derivation of the Work of Adhesion**\nThe work of adhesion, $w$, is defined as the reversible work required per unit area to separate an interface into two free surfaces. For a reversible, isothermal process, the work done on the system, $W$, is equal to the change in the Helmholtz free energy of the system, $\\Delta F$. The work of adhesion is this work per unit area, $w = \\frac{\\Delta F}{A}$.\n\nWe consider a system with an initial state and a final state.\nThe initial state is the two solids, solid $1$ and solid $2$, in perfect contact, forming an interface of area $A$. The total surface/interfacial free energy of the system in this configuration is due to the interface.\n$$F_{initial} = \\gamma_{12} A$$\nThe final state is the two solids completely separated, exposing two new free surfaces, one of solid $1$ and one of solid $2$, each with area $A$. The interface no longer exists. The total surface free energy of the system in this separated state is the sum of the energies of the two newly created surfaces.\n$$F_{final} = \\gamma_1 A + \\gamma_2 A$$\nThe change in the Helmholtz free energy of the system during this separation process is:\n$$\\Delta F = F_{final} - F_{initial} = (\\gamma_1 A + \\gamma_2 A) - \\gamma_{12} A = (\\gamma_1 + \\gamma_2 - \\gamma_{12})A$$\nThe reversible work per unit area, $w$, required to achieve this separation is therefore:\n$$w = \\frac{\\Delta F}{A} = \\frac{(\\gamma_1 + \\gamma_2 - \\gamma_{12})A}{A}$$\nThis yields the Dupré equation for the work of adhesion:\n$$w = \\gamma_1 + \\gamma_2 - \\gamma_{12}$$\n\n**Numerical Evaluation**\nWe are given the following values for the surface and interfacial energies:\n- $\\gamma_1 = 0.8 \\, \\text{J/m}^2$\n- $\\gamma_2 = 1.2 \\, \\text{J/m}^2$\n- $\\gamma_{12} = 1.5 \\, \\text{J/m}^2$\n\nSubstituting these values into the derived expression for $w$:\n$$w = (0.8 + 1.2 - 1.5) \\, \\text{J/m}^2$$\n$$w = (2.0 - 1.5) \\, \\text{J/m}^2$$\n$$w = 0.5 \\, \\text{J/m}^2$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures.\n$$w = 0.5000 \\, \\text{J/m}^2$$\n\n**Discussion of Physical Interpretation and Implications**\nThe calculated work of adhesion is $w = 0.5000 \\, \\text{J/m}^2$. The sign of $w$ is positive.\n\nA positive work of adhesion ($w > 0$) signifies that the adhered state, where the interface is formed, is energetically more favorable (i.e., has a lower total free energy) than the separated state. Consequently, external energy must be supplied to the system to overcome the attractive forces between the surfaces and separate them. This is the definition of adhesion. If $w$ were negative, the surfaces would repel each other, and the adhered state would be unstable, leading to spontaneous separation.\n\nThe work of adhesion is a critical parameter in continuum models of adhesive contact, such as the JKR and DMT theories, which extend the non-adhesive Hertzian contact theory. These models describe the elastic contact between typically spherical bodies and predict the pull-off force, $F_{pull-off}$, which is the maximum tensile force the contact can sustain before separation.\n\nIn both the JKR model (for soft, compliant materials and short-range forces) and the DMT model (for stiff materials and long-range forces), the pull-off force is directly proportional to the work of adhesion, $w$, and the effective radius of curvature, $R$.\n- For the JKR model: $F_{pull-off}^{JKR} = \\frac{3}{2}\\pi R w$\n- For the DMT model: $F_{pull-off}^{DMT} = 2\\pi R w$\n\nThe positive value of $w$ computed here ($w = 0.5000 \\, \\text{J/m}^2$) implies that a finite, non-zero pull-off force is required to separate the two solids. This is the signature of an adhesive contact. A zero or negative work of adhesion would imply a zero pull-off force, reducing the contact behavior to the purely repulsive (non-adhesive) Hertz model. Therefore, the calculated value confirms that the interaction between solid $1$ and solid $2$ is indeed adhesive, and a measurable pull-off phenomenon would be predicted by quantitative contact mechanics theories.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{0.5000}\n$$", "id": "2613428"}, {"introduction": "With the concept of work of adhesion established, the next step is to classify the nature of a specific adhesive contact. This practice [@problem_id:2613368] focuses on the celebrated Tabor parameter, $\\mu$, a dimensionless number that elegantly captures the competition between elastic deformation and the range of surface forces. You will derive this parameter from physical reasoning and use it to determine whether a contact falls into the JKR regime (for compliant, \"sticky\" contacts) or the DMT regime (for stiff, long-range-force dominated contacts), a crucial diagnostic skill in contact mechanics.", "problem": "A rigid sphere of radius $R$ approaches an elastic half-space characterized by the plane-strain reduced modulus $E^*$. The interface is adhesive with work of adhesion $w$ and a finite range of surface forces $z_0$. In adhesive contact mechanics, the transition between the Johnson–Kendall–Roberts (JKR) and Derjaguin–Muller–Toporov (DMT) asymptotic regimes is governed by a single dimensionless parameter that compares the elastic deformation induced at the contact edge by adhesion with the range $z_0$ of the surface forces.\n\nStarting from core definitions and well-tested facts of contact and fracture mechanics (energetic balance at the crack-like contact edge and the existence of a cohesive zone with traction scale set by $w$ and range $z_0$), derive a dimensionally and physically consistent expression for this dimensionless transition parameter $\\mu$ in terms of $R$, $E^*$, $w$, and $z_0$.

This parameter compares the characteristic elastic deformation induced by adhesion at the contact edge to the range $z_0$ of the surface forces.\n\nWe begin from two well-tested facts:\n1. The interfacial traction scale associated with adhesion is set by the ratio of the work of adhesion to the interaction range, so the cohesive traction scale is $\\sigma_0 \\sim w / z_0$.\n2. In linear elastic response, a representative elastic strain scale under surface traction is of the order of $\\sigma_0 / E^*$, with corresponding displacement scales proportional to geometry-dependent lengths.\n\nNear the edge of a spherical contact of radius of curvature $R$, the local gap between the sphere and the plane behaves quadratically with distance $x$ from the edge, i.e., $h(x) \\sim x^2 / R$. The surface force field is effective across a distance $z_0$, so a cohesive (adhesive) zone of extent $x \\sim \\rho$ is expected to satisfy $h(\\rho) \\sim z_0$, giving $\\rho \\sim (R z_0)^{1/2}$. While this geometric estimate identifies a natural outer length scale for adhesive interactions, the elastic singular field at the edge means the actual stress and displacement fields in the cohesive zone must be obtained from a crack-tip balance: the stress intensity from the cohesive tractions cancels the elastic singularity and the energy release rate equals the work of adhesion. In a Dugdale-type cohesive-zone construction consistent with Linear Elastic Fracture Mechanics (LEFM), with cohesive traction $\\sigma_0$ and range $z_0$ such that $w = \\sigma_0 z_0$, this balance leads to a single dimensionless measure of adhesion versus elasticity that can only depend on $R$, $E^*$, $w$, and $z_0$.\n\nBy dimensional analysis (Buckingham $\\Pi$ theorem) using $[R]=\\mathrm{L}$, $[E^*]=\\mathrm{M}\\,\\mathrm{L}^{-1}\\mathrm{T}^{-2}$, $[w]=\\mathrm{M}\\,\\mathrm{T}^{-2}$, and $[z_0]=\\mathrm{L}$, one constructs a unique dimensionless group that is consistent with the LEFM/cohesive-zone balance at the edge and that monotonically increases with increasing curvature radius $R$ and work of adhesion $w$, and decreases with increasing material stiffness (larger $E^*$) and larger interaction range $z_0$.

A value of $\\mu \\approx 5.7$ correctly indicates the JKR regime, not the DMT regime as claimed. Furthermore, the DMT regime is inconsistent with the measured pull-off force $P_c$, which we have established is JKR-like. The statement is incorrect in its calculation and its conclusions.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\nD. Even without an independent $w$, one can classify the adhesion regime using only $P_{c}$, $R$, and $E^{*}$, because $P_{c}/(R E^{*})$ is dimensionless and directly equals the Tabor parameter.\nThis statement makes two claims. First, let us check the dimensionality of the group $P_{c}/(R E^{*})$. The units are $[P_c] = \\mathrm{N}$, $[R] = \\mathrm{m}$, and $[E^*] = \\mathrm{N/m^2}$. Thus, the units of $R E^*$ are $\\mathrm{m} \\cdot (\\mathrm{N/m^2}) = \\mathrm{N/m}$. The group $P_{c}/(R E^{*})$ therefore has units of $\\mathrm{N} / (\\mathrm{N/m}) = \\mathrm{m}$. It is not dimensionless. The premise is false. Second, the classification of the regime depends on the Tabor parameter $\\mu$, which is a function of $R, w, E^*$, and $z_0$. There is no fundamental principle by which a parameter constructed only from $P_c, R, E^*$ could be equal to $\\mu$. The work of adhesion $w$ is essential for defining the adhesion energy scale and thus for determining the contact regime. The statement is fundamentally flawed.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\nE. If one adopts a specific cohesive-zone bridging model connecting $\\mu$ to the pull-off force $P_{c}$, then, in principle, the measured $P_{c}$ together with $R$, $E^{*}$, and $w$ determines a unique estimate of $z_{0}$; without such a model, a unique $z_{0}$ cannot be identified from pull-off alone.\nA bridging model provides a monotonic function $f$ such that $P_c / (\\pi R w) = f(\\mu)$. With measured $P_c$ and given $R$ and $w$, the left-hand side is a known number. Since $f$ is monotonic, the equation can be inverted to find a unique value for $\\mu$. Once $\\mu$ is uniquely determined, the definition $\\mu = (R w^2 / (E^{*2} z_0^3))^{1/3}$ can be rearranged to solve for a unique value of $z_0$, since $R, w, E^*$ are all known. The first part of the statement is therefore correct. Without such a model, one can only state that the measured $P_c$ corresponds to a certain range of $\\mu$ values (e.g., $\\mu \\gtrsim 1$ for a JKR-like result). This inequality leads only to a bound on $z_0$ (as in statement B), not a unique value. The second part of the statement is also correct. The entire statement accurately describes the epistemological status of $z_0$ in contact mechanics experiments.\nVerdict: **Correct**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{ABE}$$", "id": "2613401"}]}
