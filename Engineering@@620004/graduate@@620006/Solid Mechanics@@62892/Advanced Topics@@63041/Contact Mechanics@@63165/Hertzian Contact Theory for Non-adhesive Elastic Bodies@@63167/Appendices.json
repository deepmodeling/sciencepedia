We proceed to the solution.\n\n(a) Bound from the linearized surface metric\nThe profile of the spherical indenter is given by $z(r) = R - \\sqrt{R^{2}-r^{2}}$. The derivative with respect to the radial coordinate $r$ is:\n$$\n\\frac{dz}{dr} = \\frac{d}{dr} \\left(R - (R^{2}-r^{2})^{1/2}\\right) = - \\frac{1}{2}(R^{2}-r^{2})^{-1/2}(-2r) = \\frac{r}{\\sqrt{R^{2}-r^{2}}}\n$$\nThe fractional error in the linearized metric assumption, $ds \\approx dr$, is given by the expression $\\epsilon_{m} = \\sqrt{1+\\left(\\frac{dz}{dr}\\right)^{2}}-1$. Substituting the derivative:\n$$\n\\epsilon_{m}(r) = \\sqrt{1 + \\left(\\frac{r}{\\sqrt{R^2 - r^2}}\\right)^2} - 1 = \\sqrt{1 + \\frac{r^2}{R^2 - r^2}} - 1\n$$\nSimplifying the term under the square root:\n$$\n\\epsilon_{m}(r) = \\sqrt{\\frac{R^2 - r^2 + r^2}{R^2 - r^2}} - 1 = \\sqrt{\\frac{R^2}{R^2 - r^2}} - 1 = \\frac{R}{\\sqrt{R^2 - r^2}} - 1 = \\left(1 - \\frac{r^2}{R^2}\\right)^{-1/2} - 1\n$$\nThis error function is monotonically increasing with $r$.

The exact profile is $z_{exact}(r) = R - \\sqrt{R^2 - r^2}$. The worst-case fractional error is evaluated at $r=a$:\n$$\n\\epsilon_{p} = \\left| \\frac{z_{approx}(a) - z_{exact}(a)}{z_{exact}(a)} \\right| = \\left| \\frac{z_{exact}(a) - z_{approx}(a)}{z_{exact}(a)} \\right|\n$$\nThe second form is used because, for small argument, the Taylor series $z_{exact}(r) = \\frac{r^2}{2R} + \\frac{r^4}{8R^3} + \\dots$ shows that $z_{exact}(r) > z_{approx}(r)$ for $r>0$.

Using the governing bound $\\eta_{\\max} = \\sqrt{1 - (1.01)^{-2}}$, we find its square $\\eta_{\\max}^2 = 1 - (1.01)^{-2}$.\nSubstituting this into the sagitta relation:\n$$\n(\\delta/R)_{\\max} = 1 - \\sqrt{1 - \\eta_{\\max}^2} = 1 - \\sqrt{1 - \\left(1 - (1.01)^{-2}\\right)} = 1 - \\sqrt{(1.01)^{-2}}\n$$\nThis simplifies to:\n$$\n(\\delta/R)_{\\max} = 1 - (1.01)^{-1} = 1 - \\frac{1}{1.01} = \\frac{1.01 - 1}{1.01} = \\frac{0.01}{1.01} \\approx 0.00990099\n$$\n\nFinal numerical values\nRounding the results to four significant figures:\n$(a/R)_{\\max} \\approx 0.1404$\n$(\\delta/R)_{\\max} \\approx 0.009901$\n\nThe final result is the pair of these two values.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 0.1404 & 0.009901 \\end{pmatrix}}\n$$", "id": "2646686"}, {"introduction": "The true utility of Hertzian theory is demonstrated when it is applied to the complex geometries found in engineering practice, which rarely involve perfect spheres on flat planes.

According to Hertzian contact theory, the local geometry of two contacting smooth convex bodies can be approximated by an equivalent body of revolution contacting a flat plane. The initial gap $h(x,y)$ between the undeformed surfaces near the point of first contact is described by a quadratic form.\n\nLet a Cartesian coordinate system $(x, y, z)$ be established with its origin at the point of initial contact. The $z$-axis is aligned with the common normal to the surfaces, and the $x$ and $y$ axes lie in the common tangent plane. As per the problem statement, the axes of the cylinders define these orthogonal in-plane directions. Let the axis of cylinder $1$ be parallel to the $y$-axis and the axis of cylinder $2$ be parallel to the $x$-axis.\n\nFor a long cylinder of radius $R$, the principal radii of curvature at a point on its surface are $R$ (in the plane perpendicular to the cylinder axis) and $\\infty$ (in the plane containing the cylinder axis).\n\nFor cylinder $1$ (axis along $y$):\n- Principal radius in the $x-z$ plane: $R_{1x} = R_{1}$.\n- Principal radius in the $y-z$ plane: $R_{1y} = \\infty$.\n\nFor cylinder $2$ (axis along $x$):\n- Principal radius in the $x-z$ plane: $R_{2x} = \\infty$.\n- Principal radius in the $y-z$ plane: $R_{2y} = R_{2}$.\n\nThe local gap function $h(x, y)$ is given by the sum of the profiles of the two bodies:\n$$ h(x,y) \\approx \\frac{x^2}{2 R_{1x}} + \\frac{y^2}{2 R_{1y}} + \\frac{x^2}{2 R_{2x}} + \\frac{y^2}{2 R_{2y}} $$\nSubstituting the principal radii:\n$$ h(x,y) \\approx \\frac{x^2}{2 R_{1}} + \\frac{y^2}{2 (\\infty)} + \\frac{x^2}{2 (\\infty)} + \\frac{y^2}{2 R_{2}} = \\frac{x^2}{2 R_{1}} + \\frac{y^2}{2 R_{2}} $$\nThis quadratic form describes an elliptic paraboloid. The \"two principal curvature sums\" requested in the problem statement are the coefficients of the quadratic terms multiplied by $2$, which are $\\frac{1}{R_{1}}$ and $\\frac{1}{R_{2}}$. This formulation treats the contact as being between a rigid flat plane and an effective elastic body with principal radii of curvature $R_{1}$ and $R_{2}$ along the $x$ and $y$ axes, respectively. The contact patch will be an ellipse with semiaxes $a$ and $b$.\n\nThe problem then specifies that we must consider the case $R_{1} = R_{2} = R$. In this symmetric case, the gap function becomes:\n$$ h(x,y) = \\frac{x^2}{2R} + \\frac{y^2}{2R} = \\frac{x^2+y^2}{2R} $$\nThis is the equation of a circular paraboloid.

For a general function $f(x_1, x_2, \\dots, x_n)$ with independent variables $x_i$ having small standard uncertainties $\\sigma_{x_i}$, the squared relative uncertainty $(\\sigma_f/f)^2$ is given by first-order analysis as:\n$$\\left( \\frac{\\sigma_f}{f} \\right)^2 \\approx \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\left( \\frac{x_i}{f} \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x_i} \\right)^2 \\left( \\frac{\\sigma_{x_i}}{x_i} \\right)^2$$\nApplying this to our expression for $k = k(P, E^*, R)$, the squared relative uncertainty $u_k^2 = (\\sigma_k/k)^2$ is:\n$$u_k^2 \\approx \\left( \\frac{P}{k} \\frac{\\partial k}{\\partial P} \\right)^2 u_P^2 + \\left( \\frac{E^*}{k} \\frac{\\partial k}{\\partial E^*} \\right)^2 u_{E}^2 + \\left( \\frac{R}{k} \\frac{\\partial k}{\\partial R} \\right)^2 u_{R}^2$$\nThe problem states that the load $P$ is exact, so its uncertainty $u_P = 0$. The expression simplifies to:\n$$u_k^2 \\approx \\left( \\frac{E^*}{k} \\frac{\\partial k}{\\partial E^*} \\right)^2 u_{E}^2 + \\left( \\frac{R}{k} \\frac{\\partial k}{\\partial R} \\right)^2 u_{R}^2$$\nThe function for $k$ is a power-law form $k \\propto (E^*)^{2/3} R^{1/3}$. The sensitivity coefficients are the exponents of the variables.\nThe partial derivative with respect to $E^*$ is:\n$$\\frac{\\partial k}{\\partial E^*} = 2 \\left( \\frac{3P}{4} \\right)^{1/3} R^{1/3} \\left( \\frac{2}{3} (E^*)^{-1/3} \\right) = \\frac{2}{3} \\frac{k}{E^*}$$\nSo, the sensitivity coefficient is $\\frac{E^*}{k} \\frac{\\partial k}{\\partial E^*} = \\frac{2}{3}$.\nThe partial derivative with respect to $R$ is:\n$$\\frac{\\partial k}{\\partial R} = 2 \\left( \\frac{3P}{4} \\right)^{1/3} (E^*)^{2/3} \\left( \\frac{1}{3} R^{-2/3} \\right) = \\frac{1}{3} \\frac{k}{R}$$\nSo, the sensitivity coefficient is $\\frac{R}{k} \\frac{\\partial k}{\\partial R} = \\frac{1}{3}$.\nSubstituting these coefficients into the uncertainty equation:\n$$u_k^2 = \\left( \\frac{2}{3} \\right)^2 u_{E}^2 + \\left( \\frac{1}{3} \\right)^2 u_{R}^2 = \\frac{4}{9} u_{E}^2 + \\frac{1}{9} u_{R}^2$$\nTaking the square root gives the relative uncertainty for $k$:\n$$u_k = \\sqrt{\\frac{4}{9} u_{E}^2 + \\frac{1}{9} u_{R}^2} = \\frac{1}{3} \\sqrt{4 u_{E}^2 + u_{R}^2}$$\n\nNext, we derive the expression for the relative uncertainty in the contact radius, $u_a$. The governing equation is $a^3 = \\frac{3PR}{4E^{*}}$, which we can write as:\n$$a = \\left( \\frac{3P}{4} \\right)^{1/3} R^{1/3} (E^*)^{-1/3}$$\nThis is the function $a = a(P, E^*, R)$. We apply the same uncertainty propagation formula. Since $P$ is exact ($u_P=0$) and $E^*$ and $R$ are independent:\n$$u_a^2 = \\left( \\frac{\\sigma_a}{a} \\right)^2 \\approx \\left( \\frac{E^*}{a} \\frac{\\partial a}{\\partial E^*} \\right)^2 u_{E}^2 + \\left( \\frac{R}{a} \\frac{\\partial a}{\\partial R} \\right)^2 u_{R}^2$$\nThe function for $a$ is also a power-law form, $a \\propto R^{1/3} (E^*)^{-1/3}$. The sensitivity coefficients are the exponents.\nThe sensitivity with respect to $E^*$ is $-\\frac{1}{3}$.\nThe sensitivity with respect to $R$ is $\\frac{1}{3}$.\nSubstituting these coefficients into the uncertainty equation:\n$$u_a^2 = \\left( -\\frac{1}{3} \\right)^2 u_{E}^2 + \\left( \\frac{1}{3} \\right)^2 u_{R}^2 = \\frac{1}{9} u_{E}^2 + \\frac{1}{9} u_{R}^2$$\nTaking the square root gives the relative uncertainty for $a$:\n$$u_a = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{9} u_{E}^2 + \\frac{1}{9} u_{R}^2} = \\frac{1}{3} \\sqrt{u_{E}^2 + u_{R}^2}$$\n\nThe problem requires the final answer as a row matrix $(u_{k} \\;\\; u_{a})$. Therefore, the result is:\n$$\\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{1}{3}\\sqrt{4u_{E}^{2} + u_{R}^{2}} & \\frac{1}{3}\\sqrt{u_{E}^{2} + u_{R}^{2}} \\end{pmatrix}$$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{1}{3}\\sqrt{4u_{E}^{2} + u_{R}^{2}} & \\frac{1}{3}\\sqrt{u_{E}^{2} + u_{R}^{2}} \\end{pmatrix}}$$", "id": "2646668"}]}
