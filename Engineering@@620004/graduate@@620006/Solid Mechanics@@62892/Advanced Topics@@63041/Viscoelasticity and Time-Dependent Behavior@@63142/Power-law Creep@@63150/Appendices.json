It presents a standard exercise in dimensional analysis as applied to a fundamental constitutive model in solid mechanics, specifically Norton's power-law for creep. The problem is valid, and a solution will be derived.\n\nThe task is to determine the SI base-unit exponents of the material parameter $A$ in the power-law creep equation. The principle of dimensional homogeneity is the cornerstone of the solution. This principle dictates that any physically meaningful equation must have identical dimensions on both sides of the equality.\n\nThe given constitutive equation is:\n$$ \\dot{\\epsilon}_{c} = A\\,\\sigma^{n} $$\nwhere $\\dot{\\epsilon}_{c}$ is the uniaxial creep strain rate, $\\sigma$ is the uniaxial Cauchy stress, $A$ is the material parameter, and $n$ is the stress exponent.\n\nLet $[X]$ denote the dimensions of a physical quantity $X$. Applying the principle of dimensional homogeneity to the equation gives:\n$$ [\\dot{\\epsilon}_{c}] = [A] [\\sigma]^{n} $$\nTo find the dimensions of $A$, we rearrange this expression:\n$$ [A] = \\frac{[\\dot{\\epsilon}_{c}]}{[\\sigma]^{n}} $$\nWe must now determine the dimensions of $\\dot{\\epsilon}_{c}$ and $\\sigma$ in terms of the fundamental base dimensions of mass ($M$), length ($L$), and time ($T$).\n\nFirst, consider the creep strain rate, $\\dot{\\epsilon}_{c}$. Strain, $\\epsilon$, is defined as a dimensionless kinematic quantity, representing a ratio of lengths (e.g., change in length divided by original length). Therefore, its dimension is unity:\n$$ [\\epsilon] = 1 $$\nThe strain rate is the time derivative of strain, $\\dot{\\epsilon}_{c} = \\frac{d\\epsilon_{c}}{dt}$. The dimensions of the strain rate are thus the dimensions of strain divided by the dimension of time:\n$$ [\\dot{\\epsilon}_{c}] = \\frac{[\\epsilon_{c}]}{[t]} = \\frac{1}{T} = T^{-1} $$\n\nNext, consider the Cauchy stress, $\\sigma$. Stress is defined fundamentally as force per unit area:\n$$ [\\sigma] = \\frac{[\\text{Force}]}{[\\text{Area}]} $$\nThe dimension of area is length squared:\n$$ [\\text{Area}] = L^{2} $$\nAccording to Newton's second law, force is the product of mass and acceleration ($F=ma$).

We can substitute these into the expression for the dimensions of $A$:\n$$ [A] = \\frac{[\\dot{\\epsilon}_{c}]}{[\\sigma]^{n}} = \\frac{T^{-1}}{(M L^{-1} T^{-2})^{n}} $$\nApplying the exponent $n$ to the terms in the denominator yields:\n$$ [A] = \\frac{T^{-1}}{M^{n} L^{-n} T^{-2n}} $$\nBringing the denominator terms to the numerator changes the sign of their exponents, allowing us to combine terms:\n$$ [A] = M^{-n} L^{-(-n)} T^{-1} T^{-(-2n)} = M^{-n} L^{n} T^{2n-1} $$\nThe problem asks for the exponents on the SI base units, which correspond to the fundamental dimensions as follows:\n- Mass ($M$) corresponds to kilograms ($\\mathrm{kg}$).\n- Length ($L$) corresponds to meters ($\\mathrm{m}$).\n- Time ($T$) corresponds to seconds ($\\mathrm{s}$).\n\nThus, the exponents on the SI base units for the parameter $A$ are:\n- Exponent for $\\mathrm{kg}$: $-n$\n- Exponent for $\\mathrm{m}$: $n$\n- Exponent for $\\mathrm{s}$: $2n-1$\n\nThe final answer, as a row matrix of these exponents, is therefore constructed.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} -n & n & 2n-1 \\end{pmatrix}}$$", "id": "2673411"}, {"introduction": "Moving beyond the basic parameters, a robust constitutive model must also adhere to fundamental physical principles.

I will now proceed to the solution.\n\nThe core of the problem lies in the interpretation of the quantity $\\dot{\\epsilon}_{c}$ in the relation $\\dot{\\epsilon}_{c}=A\\,|\\sigma|^{n}$. There are two primary interpretations:\n1.  $\\dot{\\epsilon}_{c}$ represents the signed axial component of the creep strain rate tensor, let us denote this as $\\dot{\\epsilon}_{axial}$.\n2.  $\\dot{\\epsilon}_{c}$ represents a scalar measure of the magnitude of the creep strain rate, such as the von Mises equivalent strain rate, $\\dot{\\epsilon}_{eq}$, which is by definition non-negative.\n\nWe evaluate the given law under both interpretations against the foundational principles.\n\n**Analysis based on Interpretation 1: $\\dot{\\epsilon}_{c}$ is the signed axial creep strain rate $\\dot{\\epsilon}$.**\n\n-   **Principle of Tension–Compression Symmetry**: This principle dictates that the response function for the axial strain rate, $\\dot{\\epsilon}(\\sigma)$, must be an odd function of the axial stress $\\sigma$. That is, $\\dot{\\epsilon}(-\\sigma) = -\\dot{\\epsilon}(\\sigma)$.\n    Let us test the law $\\dot{\\epsilon}(\\sigma) = A\\,|\\sigma|^{n}$.\n    For a tensile stress $\\sigma = +\\sigma_{0}$, the strain rate is $\\dot{\\epsilon}(+\\sigma_{0}) = A\\,|\\sigma_{0}|^{n} = A\\,\\sigma_{0}^{n}$. Since $A>0$ and $\\sigma_{0}>0$, we have $\\dot{\\epsilon}(+\\sigma_{0}) > 0$, which corresponds to elongation.\n    For a compressive stress $\\sigma = -\\sigma_{0}$, the strain rate is $\\dot{\\epsilon}(-\\sigma_{0}) = A\\,|-\\sigma_{0}|^{n} = A\\,\\sigma_{0}^{n}$.\n    We find that $\\dot{\\epsilon}(-\\sigma_{0}) = \\dot{\\epsilon}(+\\sigma_{0})$. This directly violates the oddness requirement, as it should be $\\dot{\\epsilon}(-\\sigma_{0}) = -\\dot{\\epsilon}(+\\sigma_{0})$. The function $f(\\sigma) = A\\,|\\sigma|^{n}$ is an even function, not an odd one. Therefore, this interpretation violates the principle of tension–compression symmetry.\n\n-   **Principle of Nonnegative Dissipation**: The rate of mechanical dissipation per unit volume in uniaxial loading is $D = \\sigma\\dot{\\epsilon}$. The Second Law of Thermodynamics requires $D \\ge 0$.\n    In tension ($\\sigma = +\\sigma_{0} > 0$), we found $\\dot{\\epsilon} = A\\,\\sigma_{0}^{n} > 0$. The dissipation is $D = (+\\sigma_{0})(A\\,\\sigma_{0}^{n}) = A\\,\\sigma_{0}^{n+1} > 0$. This is physically permissible.\n    In compression ($\\sigma = -\\sigma_{0} < 0$), we found $\\dot{\\epsilon} = A\\,\\sigma_{0}^{n} > 0$. The dissipation is $D = (-\\sigma_{0})(A\\,\\sigma_{0}^{n}) = -A\\,\\sigma_{0}^{n+1} < 0$. This implies a negative rate of dissipation, which is a violation of the Second Law of Thermodynamics. The material would be producing work while deforming, which is physically impossible in this context.\n\nConclusion for Interpretation 1: Interpreting $\\dot{\\epsilon}_{c}$ as the signed axial creep strain rate renders the law $\\dot{\\epsilon}_{c} = A\\,|\\sigma|^{n}$ physically and mathematically inconsistent with the stated principles of tension-compression symmetry and nonnegative dissipation.\n\n**Analysis based on Interpretation 2: $\\dot{\\epsilon}_{c}$ is an equivalent (non-negative) strain rate, $\\dot{\\epsilon}_{eq}$.**\n\nIn modern continuum mechanics, creep is described by a tensorial relation between the rate of deformation tensor, $\\mathbf{D}$, and the Cauchy stress tensor, $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}$. For an isotropic material, this relation must be an isotropic tensor function. For incompressible plastic flow, a common and objective form is:\n$$ \\mathbf{D} = \\frac{3}{2}\\frac{\\dot{\\epsilon}_{eq}}{\\sigma_{eq}}\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}' $$\nwhere $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}'$ is the deviatoric stress tensor, $\\sigma_{eq}$ is the von Mises equivalent stress, and $\\dot{\\epsilon}_{eq}$ is the von Mises equivalent strain rate. The equivalent stress is an invariant, defined as $\\sigma_{eq} = \\sqrt{\\frac{3}{2}\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}':\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}'}$. The power law is then written for the scalar equivalent quantities: $\\dot{\\epsilon}_{eq} = f(\\sigma_{eq})$. For Norton's law, this is $\\dot{\\epsilon}_{eq} = A\\,(\\sigma_{eq})^{n}$.\n\nLet us specialize this to the case of uniaxial stress $\\sigma$ in the $x_1$-direction. The stress tensor is $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\sigma & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$.\nThe deviatoric stress is $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}' = \\boldsymbol{\\sigma} - \\frac{1}{3}\\text{tr}(\\boldsymbol{\\sigma})\\mathbf{I} = \\text{diag}(\\frac{2}{3}\\sigma, -\\frac{1}{3}\\sigma, -\\frac{1}{3}\\sigma)$.\nThe equivalent stress is $\\sigma_{eq} = \\sqrt{\\frac{3}{2} \\left[ (\\frac{2}{3}\\sigma)^2 + (-\\frac{1}{3}\\sigma)^2 + (-\\frac{1}{3}\\sigma)^2 \\right]} = \\sqrt{\\frac{3}{2} \\left[ \\frac{4}{9}\\sigma^2 + \\frac{1}{9}\\sigma^2 + \\frac{1}{9}\\sigma^2 \\right]} = \\sqrt{\\frac{3}{2} \\frac{6}{9}\\sigma^2} = \\sqrt{\\sigma^2} = |\\sigma|$.\nThus, for uniaxial stress, the power law for the equivalent strain rate becomes $\\dot{\\epsilon}_{eq} = A\\,(|\\sigma|)^{n} = A\\,|\\sigma|^{n}$.\nThis matches the provided form $\\dot{\\epsilon}_{c}=A\\,|\\sigma|^{n}$ precisely, if we identify $\\dot{\\epsilon}_{c}$ with $\\dot{\\epsilon}_{eq}$. Since $\\dot{\\epsilon}_{eq}$ is a non-negative scalar measure of the rate of creep, this interpretation is self-consistent and consistent with a general, objective, and isotropic tensorial framework. It does not violate any principles. The *signed axial strain rate* must then be derived from the tensorial law:\n$\\dot{\\epsilon}_{axial} = D_{11} = \\frac{3}{2}\\frac{\\dot{\\epsilon}_{eq}}{\\sigma_{eq}}\\sigma'_{11} = \\frac{3}{2}\\frac{A\\,|\\sigma|^{n}}{|\\sigma|}\\left(\\frac{2}{3}\\sigma\\right) = A\\,\\frac{|\\sigma|^{n}}{|\\sigma|}\\sigma = A\\,|\\sigma|^{n-1}\\sigma$.\nThis form, $A\\,\\sigma|\\sigma|^{n-1}$, is an odd function of $\\sigma$ and correctly represents the signed axial strain rate, adhering to tension-compression symmetry.\n\nNow, we evaluate the given options.\n\n**A. The law $\\dot{\\epsilon}_{c}=A\\,|\\sigma|^{n}$ can be consistent with isotropy and tension–compression symmetry provided $\\dot{\\epsilon}_{c}$ is interpreted as an equivalent (always nonnegative) scalar creep measure; it cannot be taken as the signed axial creep strain rate.**\nThis statement is correct. As demonstrated, if $\\dot{\\epsilon}_{c}$ is the equivalent strain rate $\\dot{\\epsilon}_{eq}$, the law $\\dot{\\epsilon}_{eq} = A|\\sigma|^n$ is the correct uniaxial specialization of a general isotropic power law. A proper tensorial formulation then recovers the correct signed axial strain rate which satisfies tension-compression symmetry. The second clause is also correct, as our initial analysis showed that interpreting $\\dot{\\epsilon}_{c}$ as the signed rate leads to contradictions.\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\n**B. If $\\dot{\\epsilon}_{c}$ is interpreted as the signed axial creep strain rate, the absolute value form yields $\\dot{\\epsilon}_{c}$ having the same sign in tension and compression, violating the oddness requirement under load reversal and potentially violating nonnegative dissipation in compression.**\nThis statement is correct. It accurately summarizes the results of our analysis under \"Interpretation 1\". The form $A|\\sigma|^n$ is always non-negative, meaning the predicted strain rate is positive (elongation) for both tension ($\\sigma>0$) and compression ($\\sigma<0$). This violates the oddness requirement $\\dot{\\epsilon}(-\\sigma) = -\\dot{\\epsilon}(\\sigma)$ and leads to negative dissipation $D = \\sigma\\dot{\\epsilon} < 0$ in compression.\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\n**C. If the model is intended to provide the axial (signed) creep strain rate, tension–compression symmetry under isotropy requires an odd mapping of stress, for example a dependence proportional to $\\sigma\\,|\\sigma|^{n-1}$ in uniaxial form; alternatively, a tensorial law that is coaxial with the deviatoric stress and depends on its invariants ensures the correct reversal under $\\sigma\\mapsto-\\sigma$.**\nThis statement is correct. The first part correctly identifies that an odd function is needed to satisfy symmetry, and provides the standard correct form $\\dot{\\epsilon} \\propto \\sigma|\\sigma|^{n-1}$. The second part correctly states the general principle for constructing a proper tensorial law. A law of the form $\\mathbf{D} = \\phi(\\text{invariants})\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}'$ ensures that $\\mathbf{D}$ reverses when $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}'$ reverses (which happens when $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}$ reverses), because the invariants typically used (like $\\sigma_{eq}$) are even functions of the stress components. As shown in the general analysis, this tensorial law correctly specializes to the required uniaxial form.\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\n**D. The use of $|\\sigma|$ in the scalar law violates material frame indifference, because the absolute value is not an objective function of stress.**\nThis statement is incorrect and demonstrates a misunderstanding of objectivity. Material frame indifference requires the constitutive law to be a relationship between objective tensors, expressed as an isotropic tensor function for an isotropic material. A properly formulated law, such as $\\mathbf{D} = f(\\sigma_{eq})\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}'$, is objective because it is constructed from objective tensors ($\\mathbf{D}, \\boldsymbol{\\sigma}'$) and scalar invariants ($\\sigma_{eq}$). In the special case of uniaxial stress, the invariant $\\sigma_{eq}$ becomes equal to $|\\sigma|$, the magnitude of the single non-zero principal stress. The presence of $|\\sigma|$ in the resulting scalar equation is a consequence of applying a fully objective tensorial law to a specific situation, not a violation of objectivity itself. The claim is fallacious.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**E. In uniaxial steady-state creep of isotropic materials, tension–compression symmetry requires that the magnitude of the creep strain rate be larger in compression than in tension for the same $|\\sigma|$ when $n>1$, so using $|\\sigma|$ makes the prediction asymmetric.**\nThis statement is incorrect. The problem explicitly defines tension-compression symmetry as \"reversing $\\sigma$ reverses the axial creep strain rate at the same magnitude\". This means $|\\dot{\\epsilon}(-\\sigma_0)| = |\\dot{\\epsilon}(+\\sigma_0)|$. The magnitude of the strain rate must be *equal* for tension and compression at the same stress magnitude $|\\sigma_0|$. The claim that it must be larger in compression is false and describes an asymmetric material behavior, which is contrary to the stated premise.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\nIn summary, options A, B, and C are correct statements derived from a rigorous application of continuum mechanics principles. Options D and E are based on flawed reasoning or misunderstanding of the fundamental concepts.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{ABC}$$", "id": "2673400"}, {"introduction": "The ultimate test of a constitutive model is its ability to predict complex, real-world behavior.

Differentiating with respect to time gives the strain rate $\\dot{\\varepsilon}(t) = \\dot{L}(t)/L(t)$. The volume preservation condition states that $A(t)L(t) = A_0 L_0$ is constant. This implies $A(t) = A_0 (L_0/L(t))$. From the definition of true strain, $L(t)/L_0 = e^{\\varepsilon(t)}$. Therefore, the current area is $A(t) = A_0 e^{-\\varepsilon(t)}$.\n\n2.  **Equilibrium and Stress**: Under a constant axial force $P$, the Cauchy (true) stress is $\\sigma(t) = P/A(t)$. Substituting the expression for $A(t)$, we get:\n    $$ \\sigma(t) = \\frac{P}{A_0 e^{-\\varepsilon(t)}} = \\frac{P}{A_0} e^{\\varepsilon(t)} $$\n    Letting $\\sigma_0 = P/A_0$ be the initial (engineering) stress, we have $\\sigma(t) = \\sigma_0 e^{\\varepsilon(t)}$. This shows that in a constant force test, the true stress increases as the material deforms.\n\n3.  **Constitutive Behavior**: The problem states a power-law creep relation. We write this as $\\dot{\\varepsilon}(t) = k\\,\\sigma(t)^n$, where $k$ and $n$ are positive material constants ($k>0, n>0$).\n    When damage is included, the strain rate is driven by an effective stress $\\tilde{\\sigma}(t)$.

The constitutive law becomes $\\dot{\\varepsilon}(t) = k\\,\\tilde{\\sigma}(t)^n = k \\left(\\frac{\\sigma(t)}{1-D(t)}\\right)^n$.\n\nTertiary creep is characterized by an accelerating strain rate, meaning $\\ddot{\\varepsilon}(t) = \\frac{d\\dot{\\varepsilon}}{dt} > 0$.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. Under a test in which the axial Cauchy stress $\\sigma$ is externally maintained exactly constant in time, a pure power-law creep model with constant parameters predicts a time-independent $\\dot{\\varepsilon}$ and therefore cannot enter a tertiary stage without additional physics.**\n\n-   **Condition**: The Cauchy stress is held constant, $\\sigma(t) = \\sigma_{\\text{const}}$.\n-   **Model**: The \"pure power-law creep model\" is $\\dot{\\varepsilon}(t) = k\\,\\sigma(t)^n$.\n-   **Analysis**: If $\\sigma(t)$ is constant, and the parameters $k$ and $n$ are constant, then the strain rate $\\dot{\\varepsilon} = k\\,(\\sigma_{\\text{const}})^n$ must also be constant. This scenario describes secondary, or steady-state, creep. Tertiary creep requires $\\ddot{\\varepsilon}(t) > 0$. For a constant $\\dot{\\varepsilon}$, its time derivative $\\ddot{\\varepsilon}$ is exactly $0$. Therefore, this model under this test condition cannot exhibit an accelerating strain rate. To achieve tertiary creep in a constant true stress test, one must introduce additional physical mechanisms not included in the \"pure\" model, such as damage accumulation or dynamic microstructural evolution (e.g., changes in $k$ or $n$ with time or strain).\n-   **Verdict**: **Correct**.\n\n**B. Under a constant axial force $P$ with volume-preserving creep kinematics and no damage, geometric evolution alone implies that $\\sigma(t)$ increases with $\\varepsilon(t)$, so a power-law creep model yields an increasing $\\dot{\\varepsilon}(t)$ that can diverge in finite time.**\n\n-   **Condition**: Constant force $P$, volume-preserving flow, no damage ($D(t)=0$).\n-   **Analysis**: As derived above, $\\sigma(t) = \\sigma_0 e^{\\varepsilon(t)}$. Since the specimen is in tension, it elongates, so $\\varepsilon(t)$ increases with time. Consequently, the true stress $\\sigma(t)$ also increases with time.\n-   The strain rate is $\\dot{\\varepsilon}(t) = k\\,\\sigma(t)^n = k\\,(\\sigma_0 e^{\\varepsilon(t)})^n = (k\\,\\sigma_0^n) e^{n\\varepsilon(t)}$.\n-   Since $\\varepsilon(t)$ increases, $e^{n\\varepsilon(t)}$ increases (as $n>0$), which means $\\dot{\\varepsilon}(t)$ increases. An increasing strain rate is, by definition, a form of tertiary creep. This is often called geometric softening.\n-   To check for divergence in finite time, we solve the differential equation $\\frac{d\\varepsilon}{dt} = C e^{n\\varepsilon}$, where $C=k\\,\\sigma_0^n$. Separating variables gives $e^{-n\\varepsilon}d\\varepsilon = C dt$. Integrating from $t=0$ (with $\\varepsilon(0)=0$) to a failure time $t_f$ (at strain $\\varepsilon_f$):\n    $$ \\int_0^{\\varepsilon_f} e^{-n\\varepsilon} d\\varepsilon = \\int_0^{t_f} C dt \\implies \\left[-\\frac{1}{n}e^{-n\\varepsilon}\\right]_0^{\\varepsilon_f} = C t_f $$\n    $$ \\frac{1}{n}(1 - e^{-n\\varepsilon_f}) = C t_f $$\n    The time to rupture (theoretically, infinite strain, $\\varepsilon_f \\to \\infty$) is $t_f = \\lim_{\\varepsilon_f \\to \\infty} \\frac{1}{nC}(1 - e^{-n\\varepsilon_f}) = \\frac{1}{nC} = \\frac{1}{n k \\sigma_0^n}$.\n    Since this time is finite and positive, the strain diverges in finite time, leading to rupture.\n-   **Verdict**: **Correct**.\n\n**C. If isotropic damage is modeled by $D(t)$ reducing the effective area as $A_{\\mathrm{eff}}(t) = \\big(1-D(t)\\big)\\,A(t)$, then the effective stress driving creep increases as $\\tilde{\\sigma}(t) = \\sigma(t)/\\big(1-D(t)\\big)$. If $\\dot{D}(t)>0$, this accelerates creep under fixed external force $P$ relative to the no-damage case.**\n\n-   **Analysis**: The definition of effective stress is the force $P$ divided by the effective area $A_{\\mathrm{eff}}(t)$:\n    $$ \\tilde{\\sigma}(t) = \\frac{P}{A_{\\mathrm{eff}}(t)} = \\frac{P}{(1-D(t))A(t)} = \\frac{1}{1-D(t)} \\left(\\frac{P}{A(t)}\\right) = \\frac{\\sigma(t)}{1-D(t)} $$\n    This confirms the first part of the statement. The constitutive law is $\\dot{\\varepsilon} = k\\,\\tilde{\\sigma}^n$.\n    -   In the no-damage case ($D=0$): $\\dot{\\varepsilon}_{\\text{no-damage}} = k\\,\\sigma(t)^n$.\n    -   In the damage case ($D>0$): $\\dot{\\varepsilon}_{\\text{damage}} = k\\left(\\frac{\\sigma(t)}{1-D(t)}\\right)^n = (k\\,\\sigma(t)^n) \\frac{1}{(1-D(t))^n}$.\n    So, $\\dot{\\varepsilon}_{\\text{damage}} = \\dot{\\varepsilon}_{\\text{no-damage}} \\cdot (1-D(t))^{-n}$.\n    If damage accumulates, $\\dot{D}(t)>0$, then $D(t)$ increases from $0$. Since $D(t) \\in [0,1)$ and $n>0$, the factor $(1-D(t))^{-n}$ is always greater than $1$ for $D>0$ and increases as $D$ increases. This means that at any given Cauchy stress $\\sigma(t)$, the presence of damage increases the strain rate. This effect combines with the geometric effect (increasing $\\sigma(t)$) to produce even more rapid acceleration. The statement is a correct description of the role of damage.\n-   **Verdict**: **Correct**.\n\n**D. Tertiary creep driven by necking can be captured by a pure power-law creep relation in small-strain geometry (i.e., without accounting for evolving cross-section) simply by choosing an exponent $n>1$.**\n\n-   **Analysis**: The \"small-strain geometry\" assumption implies that changes in the cross-sectional area are negligible, so $A(t) \\approx A_0$. Under a constant force $P$, this means the stress is approximately constant: $\\sigma(t) \\approx P/A_0 = \\sigma_0$.\n-   With a constant stress, the pure power-law relation $\\dot{\\varepsilon} = k\\,\\sigma^n$ yields a constant strain rate: $\\dot{\\varepsilon} \\approx k\\,\\sigma_0^n = \\text{constant}$.\n-   This is secondary creep, not tertiary creep ($\\ddot{\\varepsilon}=0$). The value of the exponent $n$ (whether it is greater than $1$ or not) does not change this conclusion; as long as $n$ is a constant, a constant stress will produce a constant strain rate.\n-   Furthermore, \"necking\" is precisely the geometric instability resulting from the non-uniform reduction of the cross-section, an effect that is explicitly ignored by the \"small-strain geometry\" assumption. The statement is thus self-contradictory.\n-   **Verdict**: **Incorrect**.\n\n**E. If damage is present but the external force $P$ is held constant and the geometry remains uniform (no necking), then the Cauchy stress $\\sigma(t)$ is unaffected by $D(t)$ and tertiary creep cannot occur in a power-law model augmented with the effective area reduction $A_{\\mathrm{eff}}(t) = \\big(1-D(t)\\big)\\,A(t)$.**\n\n-   **Analysis**: This statement contains two claims.\n    1.  \"the Cauchy stress $\\sigma(t)$ is unaffected by $D(t)$\".\n        The evolution of strain is given by $\\dot{\\varepsilon} = k (\\frac{\\sigma(t)}{1-D(t)})^n$. Since $\\sigma(t) = \\sigma_0 e^{\\varepsilon(t)}$, this becomes $\\dot{\\varepsilon} = k (\\frac{\\sigma_0 e^{\\varepsilon(t)}}{1-D(t)})^n$. The rate of strain accumulation, $\\dot{\\varepsilon}$, clearly depends on the damage $D(t)$. Therefore, the integrated strain $\\varepsilon(t)$ depends on the history of damage. Since the Cauchy stress $\\sigma(t)$ is an explicit function of $\\varepsilon(t)$, its time evolution is also affected by $D(t)$. The claim is false.\n    2.  \"tertiary creep cannot occur\".\n        Tertiary creep is an accelerating strain rate, $\\ddot{\\varepsilon}>0$. Let's compute the acceleration.\n        $\\dot{\\varepsilon} = k \\left( \\frac{\\sigma_0 e^{\\varepsilon}}{1-D} \\right)^n$. Taking the logarithm: $\\ln(\\dot{\\varepsilon}) = \\ln(k\\,\\sigma_0^n) + n\\varepsilon - n\\ln(1-D)$.\n        Differentiating with respect to time gives:\n        $$ \\frac{\\ddot{\\varepsilon}}{\\dot{\\varepsilon}} = n\\dot{\\varepsilon} - n \\frac{-\\dot{D}}{1-D} = n\\dot{\\varepsilon} + \\frac{n\\dot{D}}{1-D} $$\n        $$ \\ddot{\\varepsilon} = \\dot{\\varepsilon} \\left( n\\dot{\\varepsilon} + \\frac{n\\dot{D}}{1-D} \\right) $$\n        Since the bar is in tension, $\\dot{\\varepsilon}>0$. The material constants $k,n$ are positive. By premise, damage is present, so we assume it accumulates, $\\dot{D}>0$. Given $D \\in [0,1)$, all terms in the expression for $\\ddot{\\varepsilon}$ are positive. Thus, $\\ddot{\\varepsilon} > 0$. Tertiary creep not only can occur, it is guaranteed by the combined effects of geometric softening and damage accumulation. This claim is also false.\n-   Since both claims are false, the statement is incorrect.\n-   **Verdict**: **Incorrect**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{ABC}$$", "id": "2673385"}]}
