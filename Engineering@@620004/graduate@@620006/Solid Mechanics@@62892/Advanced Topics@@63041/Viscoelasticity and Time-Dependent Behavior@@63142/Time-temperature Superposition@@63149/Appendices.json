Therefore, the problem is deemed valid and a formal solution can be constructed.\n\nThe Williams–Landel–Ferry (WLF) equation describes the temperature dependence of the horizontal shift factor, $a_T$, for thermorheologically simple materials.

All necessary data and definitions are provided, and there are no internal contradictions or ambiguities. The problem is therefore deemed valid and a solution will be provided.\n\nThe objective is to determine the two material constants, $C_1$ and $C_2$, of the Williams–Landel–Ferry (WLF) equation for three distinct datasets.

The measured creep compliance is denoted by $J(t,T)$. The data are plotted as $\\log J$ versus $\\log t$ for temperatures $T$ spanning a narrow range around a chosen reference temperature $T_r$. Using only horizontal time shifts (i.e., replacing $t$ by $t/a_T$ for temperature-dependent shift factors $a_T$), the curves nearly collapse. However, to achieve the best overlap, a small temperature-dependent vertical factor $b_T$ (multiplicative on compliance) improves the collapse, with $b_T$ lying between $0.97$ and $1.04$ across the measured temperatures.

The material is strictly thermorheologically simple, because the high-quality collapse by horizontal shifts proves that vertical adjustments are unnecessary; any residual differences are irrelevant.\n\nB. The material is not strictly thermorheologically simple, because the need for a non-unity vertical factor $b_T$ indicates a small temperature dependence of compliance amplitudes in addition to time scaling; however, because the curve shape is invariant and $b_T$ is close to unity and uniform in time, it can be treated as approximately thermorheologically simple for constructing a master curve with a single horizontal shift factor, and a Williams–Landel–Ferry (WLF) equation may be used to describe $a_T$.\n\nC. The material is strictly thermorheologically simple only if one admits both a horizontal factor $a_T$ and a vertical factor $b_T$ as required by definition; therefore the observation that $b_T \\neq 1$ conclusively confirms thermorheological simplicity.\n\nD.

The concepts of creep compliance, time-temperature superposition, horizontal shift factors ($a_T$), and vertical shift factors ($b_T$) are standard principles in the field of polymer rheology and solid mechanics. The numerical values provided for $b_T$ and the misfit are physically realistic and typical of experimental data for polymers. The problem is well-posed, asking for a correct physical interpretation of a described experimental outcome based on established theory. The language is objective and precise. The problem is self-contained and does not contain scientific flaws, inconsistencies, or ambiguities.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. A full solution will be derived.\n\n**Derivation and Analysis**\n\nThe principle of time-temperature superposition for a thermorheologically simple material states that the effect of changing temperature from a reference $T_r$ to a temperature $T$ is equivalent to scaling the timescale by a factor $a_T(T)$. For creep compliance $J(t,T)$, the strict mathematical form is:\n$$\nJ(t, T) = J(t/a_T, T_r)\n$$\nThis equation implies that on a plot of $\\log J$ versus $\\log t$, the curve for temperature $T$ is identical in shape to the curve for $T_r$ and can be superimposed perfectly upon it by a purely horizontal shift of magnitude $\\log a_T$. This holds if and only if the underlying retardation spectrum $L(\\tau)$ does not change its shape with temperature, and all retardation times $\\tau_i$ scale with the same factor $a_T$: $\\tau_i(T) = a_T \\tau_i(T_r)$.\n\nThe problem states that a better collapse of the data is achieved using a modified relation:\n$$\nJ(t, T) \\approx b_T J(t/a_T, T_r)\n$$\nwhere $b_T$ is a vertical shift factor. Taking the logarithm of both sides gives:\n$$\n\\log J(t, T) \\approx \\log b_T + \\log J(t/a_T, T_r)\n$$\nThis demonstrates that a vertical shift of magnitude $\\log b_T$ is required in addition to the horizontal shift of $\\log a_T$.\n\nThe fact that $b_T \\neq 1$ signifies that the material is **not strictly thermorheologically simple**. The strict definition allows only for a time shift. The presence of $b_T$ indicates a temperature dependence of the compliance amplitudes. In the context of the retardation spectrum, $L(\\tau)$, this implies that the amplitudes of the spectral components (the retardation strengths) have a dependence on temperature, in addition to the temperature dependence of the retardation times.\n\nHowever, the problem provides critical additional information:\n1.  The vertical shift factor $b_T$ is small, close to $1$. This is often the case in polymers and can be related to the temperature and density effects on rubbery modulus, via the relation $b_T \\approx \\frac{\\rho(T_r)T_r}{\\rho(T)T}$. For the given range of temperatures, this factor is expected to be near unity.\n2.  The overlapped curves have \"indistinguishable local slopes\". This implies that the shape of the creep compliance curve on a log-log scale is invariant with temperature. This is a crucial observation, as it suggests that the shape of the retardation spectrum $L(\\tau)$ is also preserved, even if its overall magnitude is scaled by $b_T$. A material is deemed \"thermorheologically complex\" when different retardation mechanisms have different temperature dependencies, leading to a change in the shape of the spectrum and an inability to superimpose the curves even with vertical shifts.\n\nSince the shape is preserved and the vertical correction is small and uniform, the material's behavior is very close to simple. It is standard and accepted practice in polymer physics to consider such materials as **approximately thermorheologically simple**. A high-quality master curve can be constructed, and the temperature dependence of the primary dynamic process, captured by $a_T$, can be modeled using an appropriate equation such as the Williams–Landel–Ferry (WLF) equation.\n\n**Evaluation of Options**\n\n**A. The material is strictly thermorheologically simple, because the high-quality collapse by horizontal shifts proves that vertical adjustments are unnecessary; any residual differences are irrelevant.**\nThis is **Incorrect**. The statement dismisses the quantitative improvement in misfit (from $1.5\\%$ to $0.7\\%$) as \"irrelevant\". This is not a scientifically rigorous approach. The fact that a non-unity vertical shift factor is required explicitly violates the definition of *strict* thermorheological simplicity.\n\n**B. The material is not strictly thermorheologically simple, because the need for a non-unity vertical factor $b_T$ indicates a small temperature dependence of compliance amplitudes in addition to time scaling; however, because the curve shape is invariant and $b_T$ is close to unity and uniform in time, it can be treated as approximately thermorheologically simple for constructing a master curve with a single horizontal shift factor, and a Williams–Landel–Ferry (WLF) equation may be used to describe $a_T$.**\nThis is **Correct**. This option accurately diagnoses the situation. It correctly states that the material is not *strictly* simple due to $b_T \\neq 1$. It correctly identifies the physical meaning of $b_T$ (temperature-dependent amplitudes). Most importantly, it draws the correct practical conclusion based on the observed shape invariance and small magnitude of $b_T$: the material can be treated as *approximately* simple, and the standard procedures for constructing a master curve and modeling $a_T$ (e.g., with WLF) are applicable and justified.\n\n**C. The material is strictly thermorheologically simple only if one admits both a horizontal factor $a_T$ and a vertical factor $b_T$ as required by definition; therefore the observation that $b_T \\neq 1$ conclusively confirms thermorheological simplicity.**\nThis is **Incorrect**. This statement misrepresents the definition of thermorheological simplicity. The strict definition involves only the horizontal shift factor $a_T$. Including $b_T$ is a common but distinct modification. Claiming that the need for $b_T$ *confirms* simplicity is a logical error.\n\n**D. The material is thermorheologically complex, because the need for any vertical adjustment necessarily implies that the retardation spectrum shape changes with temperature; therefore, even with identical slopes and excellent overlap, no master curve should be constructed and no single $a_T$ should be fit.**\nThis is **Incorrect**. This conclusion is too extreme and based on a false premise. A uniform vertical shift does *not* imply a change in the spectrum's *shape*, but rather its *magnitude*. The problem explicitly states that the local slopes are indistinguishable after shifting, which is strong evidence *against* a change in spectral shape. A thermorheologically complex material is one for which superposition fails because the spectral shape changes. Since excellent overlap is achieved here, the material is not complex, and constructing a master curve is the correct procedure.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2703378"}]}
