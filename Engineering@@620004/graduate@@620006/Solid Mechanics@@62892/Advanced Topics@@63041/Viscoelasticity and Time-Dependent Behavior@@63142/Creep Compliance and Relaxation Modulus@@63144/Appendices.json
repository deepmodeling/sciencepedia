The cornerstone of this distinction lies in the terminal (long-time) behavior of these functions, which is dictated by the material's response to sustained loading or deformation.\n\nFirst, we establish the fundamental principles from the theory of linear viscoelasticity.\n\nA **viscoelastic solid** is a material that, under a constant applied stress, eventually reaches a state of finite equilibrium strain. Under a constant applied strain, the stress relaxes to a finite, non-zero equilibrium modulus. In mathematical terms, for a small step stress $\\sigma_0$ and a small step strain $\\varepsilon_0$:\n1.  The creep compliance $J(t) = \\varepsilon(t)/\\sigma_0$ approaches a finite, constant value as time goes to infinity:\n    $$ \\lim_{t \\to \\infty} J(t) = J_e < \\infty $$\n    where $J_e$ is the equilibrium compliance.\n2.  The relaxation modulus $G(t) = \\sigma(t)/\\varepsilon_0$ approaches a non-zero, constant value as time goes to infinity:\n    $$ \\lim_{t \\to \\infty} G(t) = G_e > 0 $$\n    where $G_e$ is the equilibrium modulus.\n\nA **viscoelastic fluid** is a material that, under a constant applied stress, flows indefinitely. Under a constant applied strain, the stress eventually relaxes completely to zero.\n1.  The creep compliance $J(t)$ exhibits a term that grows linearly with time, corresponding to viscous flow. Therefore, it does not approach a finite limit:\n    $$ J(t) \\to J_e^0 + \\frac{t}{\\eta_0} \\quad \\text{as } t \\to \\infty $$\n    where $J_e^0$ is the steady-state recoverable compliance and $\\eta_0$ is the zero-shear-rate viscosity. Thus, $\\lim_{t \\to \\infty} J(t) = \\infty$, with a constant long-time slope $\\mathrm{d}J/\\mathrm{d}t = 1/\\eta_0$.\n2.  The relaxation modulus $G(t)$ decays to zero as time goes to infinity:\n    $$ \\lim_{t \\to \\infty} G(t) = 0 $$\n\nThe transition from transient to terminal behavior is governed by the material's relaxation spectrum, specifically by its longest relaxation time, $\\tau_{\\max}$. To reliably observe the true terminal behavior and avoid misclassification based on transient phenomena (such as a \"false plateau\"), the experimental observation time, $t_{\\text{obs}}$, must be significantly longer than $\\tau_{\\max}$.

Its key elements are correct:\n1.  **Observation Time:** It mandates an observation time $t_{\\text{obs}} \\ge 10\\,\\hat{\\tau}$, where $\\hat{\\tau}$ is an estimate of $\\tau_{\\max}$. Given the pre-screen information $\\tau_{\\max} \\le 10^3 \\ \\mathrm{s}$, a conservative and correct approach is to use $\\hat{\\tau} = 10^3 \\ \\mathrm{s}$. This leads to $t_{\\text{obs}} \\ge 10^4 \\ \\mathrm{s}$. This duration is sufficient to ensure the system has reached its terminal response regime. The suggestion to estimate $\\hat{\\tau}$ from *early* decay data is methodologically poor, as long relaxation times have minimal influence at short times, but the protocol wisely constrains $\\hat{\\tau} \\le 10^3 \\ \\mathrm{s}$ and provides a fallback to the known upper bound.\n2.  **Decision Criteria:** The criteria for classification are practical implementations of the theoretical definitions. For a solid, checking for a plateau in $J(t)$ (change < $2\\%$) and a non-zero plateau in $G(t)$ ($> 5\\%$ of $G(0^+)$) is correct. For a fluid, checking for a linear increase in $J(t)$ and decay of $G(t)$ to near-zero ($< 5\\%$ of $G(0^+)$) is also correct. These criteria are evaluated in the final decade of the experiment $[t_{\\text{obs}}/10, t_{\\text{obs}}]$, which is precisely the time window where the terminal behavior should be manifest.\n3.  **Cross-Validation:** Using both creep and stress relaxation tests provides two independent, but related, measurements to confirm the material's nature, enhancing the reliability of the classification.\n\nDespite the slightly naive suggestion for the pilot test, the core methodology for the main experiment is robust, scientifically correct, and directly addresses the problem.\n**Verdict:** Correct.\n\n**B.

If the initial slope $\\mathrm{d}J/\\mathrm{d}t$ at $t=0^{+}$ is nonzero, classify as a viscoelastic fluid; if it is zero within noise, classify as a viscoelastic solid. Observation beyond $t=\\hat{\\tau}$ is not necessary.**\n\nThis protocol is flawed in every critical aspect.\n1.  **Observable:** The distinction between a solid and a fluid lies in their *long-time* ($t \\to \\infty$) behavior, specifically the slope of $J(t)$. This protocol incorrectly focuses on the *initial* slope at $t=0^+$. For most viscoelastic materials, both solids and fluids, the initial slope $\\mathrm{d}J/\\mathrm{d}t|_{t=0^+}$ is non-zero due to the presence of fast relaxation/retardation modes. It is not a distinguishing feature.\n2.  **Observation Time:** The proposed duration $t_{\\text{obs}}=\\hat{\\tau}$ (i.e., one longest relaxation time) is grossly insufficient. At this time, the transient response is still very significant ($e^{-1} \\approx 0.37$), making it impossible to ascertain the true terminal behavior.\n\nThis protocol is based on a fundamental misunderstanding of viscoelasticity.\n**Verdict:** Incorrect.\n\n**C. Perform only a stress relaxation test for duration $t_{\\text{obs}}=0.1\\,\\hat{\\tau}$, where $\\hat{\\tau}\\leq 10^{3}\\ \\mathrm{s}$ is an upper-bound slow time estimated from the early decay of $G(t)$. If $G(t)$ decreases by more than $10\\%$ in this window, classify as a viscoelastic fluid; otherwise classify as a viscoelastic solid. No creep measurement is required.**\n\nThis protocol is also fundamentally incorrect.\n1.  **Observation Time:** It proposes a test duration of $t_{\\text{obs}}=0.1\\,\\hat{\\tau}$. At best, using $\\hat{\\tau} = 10^3 \\ \\mathrm{s}$, this is $100 \\ \\mathrm{s}$. At $t = 0.1\\,\\tau_{\\max}$, the contribution from the slowest mode has decayed by only about $10\\%$ ($1-e^{-0.1} \\approx 0.095$). It is impossible to distinguish a slow decay to zero (fluid) from a slow decay to a non-zero plateau (solid) on such a short timescale.\n2.  **Decision Criterion:** The criterion is arbitrary. Both viscoelastic solids and fluids will exhibit a decrease in $G(t)$ at short times. The magnitude of this initial drop depends on the distribution of fast relaxation times, not on whether the material is ultimately a solid or a fluid.\n\nThis protocol is scientifically baseless.\n**Verdict:** Incorrect.\n\n**D. Perform both creep and stress relaxation tests, but limit total observation to $t_{\\text{obs}}=10\\,\\tau_{\\min}$, where $\\tau_{\\min}$ is the fastest observed decay time inferred from the early transient of either $J(t)$ or $G(t)$.

The behavior of $G(t)$ at long times is not needed for the decision.**\n\nThis protocol demonstrates a catastrophic confusion of timescales.\n1.  **Observation Time:** It bases the observation time on $\\tau_{\\min}$, the *shortest* relaxation time. The terminal behavior is governed by $\\tau_{\\max}$, the *longest* relaxation time. In a typical polymer, $\\tau_{\\min}$ and $\\tau_{\\max}$ can be separated by many orders of magnitude. An experiment of duration $10\\,\\tau_{\\min}$ would investigate only the most rapid, glassy dynamics and would provide no information whatsoever about the long-time flow or equilibrium properties.\n2.  **Decision Criterion:** Any apparent plateau observed at $t=10\\,\\tau_{\\min}$ would be a transient feature, not the true equilibrium state. This leads to a high probability of misclassifying a fluid as a solid.\n\nThis protocol is built upon a fundamental error in identifying the relevant physical timescale.\n**Verdict:** Incorrect.\n\nIn conclusion, only protocol A describes a scientifically valid method for distinguishing between a viscoelastic solid and a viscoelastic fluid.

The number of ions (counts) in any given region of the spectrum is governed by Poisson statistics.\n\nA crucial task in analyzing APT data is to determine whether a small peak is a real feature corresponding to a specific element or simply a statistical fluctuation of the background. To formalize this, a significance criterion is established.\n\nConsider a peak in the mass spectrum. Let the average background count per mass-to-charge ratio bin be denoted by the symbol $B$. The peak of interest has a width spanning $W$ bins. A peak is defined as statistically significant if its net signal count (total counts in the peak minus the expected background contribution) is greater than or equal to $k$ times the standard deviation of the *total observed count* within the peak region, where $k$ is a dimensionless factor determining the confidence level.\n\nDerive a closed-form analytic expression for the minimum total number of counts, $N_{\\text{peak,min}}$, that a peak must contain to be considered statistically significant, as a function of the parameters $B$, $W$, and $k$.", "solution": "1. Let the total observed counts in the peak region be $N_{\\text{peak}}$. The expected background in $W$ bins is $BW$. By Poisson statistics, the variance of the total observed counts is $\\sigma^2 = N_{\\text{peak}}$, so the standard deviation is $\\sigma = \\sqrt{N_{\\text{peak}}}$.\n\n2. The significance criterion is\n$$\nN_{\\text{peak}} - BW \\ge k \\sqrt{N_{\\text{peak}}}.\n$$\n\n3. Rearrange the equality for the minimum case:\n$$\nN_{\\text{peak}} - k \\sqrt{N_{\\text{peak}}} - BW = 0.\n$$\nLet $x = \\sqrt{N_{\\text{peak}}}$, so the equation becomes a quadratic in $x$: $x^2 - kx - BW = 0$. Solving for $x$ using the quadratic formula and taking the positive root (since $x$ must be real and positive):\n$$\nx = \\frac{k + \\sqrt{k^2 + 4BW}}{2}.\n$$\n\n4. The minimum total number of counts is therefore $N_{\\text{peak,min}} = x^2$.\n$$\nN_{\\text{peak,min}} = \\frac{\\left(k + \\sqrt{k^2 + 4BW}\\right)^2}{4}.\n$$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{\\bigl(k+\\sqrt{k^2+4BW}\\bigr)^2}{4}}$$", "id": "27810"}]}
