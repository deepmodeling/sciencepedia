It is scientifically sound, self-contained, and all terms are formally defined. Therefore, I will proceed with its solution.\n\nThe core of the task is to apply the elastic-viscoelastic correspondence principle (EVCP). This principle dictates that we first solve the equivalent linear elastic problem and then, through a set of formal substitutions, obtain the solution for the linear viscoelastic problem in the Laplace domain.\n\nThe elastic problem is the classic Lamé problem for a thick-walled cylinder under internal pressure $p_0$ and the plane strain condition $\\epsilon_{zz}=0$.\n\nThe governing equations for the elastic problem are as follows:\n\n$1$. Equilibrium in cylindrical coordinates, assuming axisymmetry and no body forces:\n$$ \\frac{d\\sigma_{rr}}{dr} + \\frac{\\sigma_{rr} - \\sigma_{\\theta\\theta}}{r} = 0 $$\n\n$2$. Kinematic relations for small strains, assuming radial displacement $u(r)$ only:\n$$ \\epsilon_{rr} = \\frac{du}{dr}, \\quad \\epsilon_{\\theta\\theta} = \\frac{u}{r} $$\nThe plane strain constraint is $\\epsilon_{zz} = 0$.\n\n$3$. Isotropic linear elastic constitutive relations:\nThe stress components are related to the strain components. For plane strain ($\\epsilon_{zz} = 0$), the relevant relations are:\n$$ \\sigma_{rr} = (\\lambda + 2G)\\epsilon_{rr} + \\lambda\\epsilon_{\\theta\\theta} $$\n$$ \\sigma_{\\theta\\theta} = \\lambda\\epsilon_{rr} + (\\lambda + 2G)\\epsilon_{\\theta\\theta} $$\nwhere $\\lambda$ and $G$ are the Lamé parameters. $G$ is the shear modulus, and $\\lambda$ is related to the bulk modulus $K$ and shear modulus $G$ by $\\lambda = K - \\frac{2}{3}G$.\n\nFirst, we solve for the stress field. The stress distribution for this problem is statically determinate, meaning it can be found from the equilibrium equation and stress boundary conditions alone, without recourse to material properties. The general solution to the equilibrium equation is of the form:\n$$ \\sigma_{rr}(r) = C_1 - \\frac{C_2}{r^2} $$\n$$ \\sigma_{\\theta\\theta}(r) = C_1 + \\frac{C_2}{r^2} $$\nThe constants of integration $C_1$ and $C_2$ are determined from the boundary conditions on stress. For the elastic problem, let the internal pressure be a constant $p_0$. With the sign convention that tensile stress is positive, the boundary conditions are:\n$$ \\sigma_{rr}(r=a) = -p_0 $$\n$$ \\sigma_{rr}(r=b) = 0 $$\n\nApplying these conditions:\n$$ C_1 - \\frac{C_2}{a^2} = -p_0 $$\n$$ C_1 - \\frac{C_2}{b^2} = 0 $$\n\nSolving this system of linear equations for $C_1$ and $C_2$ yields:\n$$ C_1 = \\frac{p_0 a^2}{b^2 - a^2} $$\n$$ C_2 = \\frac{p_0 a^2 b^2}{b^2 - a^2} $$\n\nSubstituting these constants back into the general solution gives the elastic stress field:\n$$ \\sigma_{rr,el}(r) = \\frac{p_0 a^2}{b^2 - a^2} \\left( 1 - \\frac{b^2}{r^2} \\right) $$\n$$ \\sigma_{\\theta\\theta,el}(r) = \\frac{p_0 a^2}{b^2 - a^2} \\left( 1 + \\frac{b^2}{r^2} \\right) $$\n\nNext, we determine the displacement field $u_{el}(r)$. This requires the constitutive law. We can express the strains in terms of stresses. For an isotropic material, the strain difference is related to the stress difference through the shear modulus $G$:\n$$ \\epsilon_{\\theta\\theta} - \\epsilon_{rr} = \\frac{1}{2G}(\\sigma_{\\theta\\theta} - \\sigma_{rr}) $$\nSubstituting the kinematic relations and the stress solutions:\n$$ \\frac{u}{r} - \\frac{du}{dr} = \\frac{1}{2G} \\left( \\left(C_1 + \\frac{C_2}{r^2}\\right) - \\left(C_1 - \\frac{C_2}{r^2}\\right) \\right) = \\frac{C_2}{G r^2} $$\nThis is equivalent to $-\\frac{d}{dr}\\left(\\frac{u}{r}\\right) = \\frac{C_2}{G r^3}$, which is not the most direct route.\n\nA more direct method is to relate strain components to the displacement general solution $u(r) = D_1 r + D_2/r$. This form satisfies the Navier-Cauchy equation for this geometry. The strains are $\\epsilon_{rr} = D_1 - D_2/r^2$ and $\\epsilon_{\\theta\\theta} = D_1 + D_2/r^2$.\nSubstituting into the constitutive law for plane strain gives:\n$$ \\sigma_{rr} = (\\lambda + 2G)(D_1 - D_2/r^2) + \\lambda(D_1 + D_2/r^2) = 2(\\lambda+G)D_1 - 2G\\frac{D_2}{r^2} $$\n$$ \\sigma_{\\theta\\theta} = \\lambda(D_1 - D_2/r^2) + (\\lambda + 2G)(D_1 + D_2/r^2) = 2(\\lambda+G)D_1 + 2G\\frac{D_2}{r^2} $$\nComparing these with the general stress solution $\\sigma_{rr} = C_1 - C_2/r^2$ and $\\sigma_{\\theta\\theta} = C_1 + C_2/r^2$, we identify:\n$$ C_1 = 2(\\lambda+G)D_1 $$\n$$ C_2 = 2G D_2 $$\nFrom this, we solve for the displacement coefficients $D_1$ and $D_2$:\n$$ D_1 = \\frac{C_1}{2(\\lambda+G)}, \\quad D_2 = \\frac{C_2}{2G} $$\nThe elastic displacement field is thus:\n$$ u_{el}(r) = \\frac{C_1}{2(\\lambda+G)} r + \\frac{C_2}{2G} \\frac{1}{r} $$\nThe problem specifies material properties in terms of bulk modulus $K$ and shear modulus $G$. We use the relation $\\lambda = K - \\frac{2}{3}G$. Therefore, the denominator term becomes $2(\\lambda+G) = 2(K - \\frac{2}{3}G + G) = 2(K + \\frac{1}{3}G)$.\nSubstituting the expressions for $C_1$ and $C_2$:\n$$ u_{el}(r) = \\frac{p_0 a^2}{b^2-a^2} \\left[ \\frac{r}{2(K + \\frac{1}{3}G)} + \\frac{b^2}{2Gr} \\right] $$\nThis can be written as:\n$$ u_{el}(r) = \\frac{p_0 a^2}{2(b^2 - a^2)} \\left( \\frac{r}{K + \\frac{1}{3}G} + \\frac{b^2}{rG} \\right) $$\n\nNow we apply the EVCP. The Laplace transform of the viscoelastic solution is obtained by replacing the elastic constants with their corresponding Laplace-domain operators, and the time-dependent loading with its Laplace transform. In this case, the substitutions are:\n$$ p_0 \\rightarrow P(s) = \\mathcal{L}\\{p(t)\\} $$\n$$ K \\rightarrow K_s(s) $$\n$$ G \\rightarrow G_s(s) $$\nThe geometric factors $r$, $a$, $b$ are unchanged.\n\nApplying these substitutions to the elastic solutions for stress and displacement yields the Laplace transforms of the viscoelastic fields.\n\nFor the stress fields, since the elastic expressions are independent of material properties, so are their viscoelastic counterparts in the Laplace domain:\n$$ \\Sigma_{rr}(r,s) = \\frac{P(s) a^2}{b^2 - a^2} \\left( 1 - \\frac{b^2}{r^2} \\right) $$\n$$ \\Sigma_{\\theta\\theta}(r,s) = \\frac{P(s) a^2}{b^2 - a^2} \\left( 1 + \\frac{b^2}{r^2} \\right) $$\n\nFor the displacement field, the moduli are present, so the substitution yields:\n$$ u_s(r,s) = \\frac{P(s) a^2}{2(b^2 - a^2)} \\left( \\frac{r}{K_s(s) + \\frac{1}{3}G_s(s)} + \\frac{b^2}{r G_s(s)} \\right) $$\n\nThese are the required closed-form expressions.

Your procedure must address the handling of boundary conditions, initial conditions, the choice of moduli to substitute, and essential requirements for numerical inversion.\n\nA. Verify small strains, linearity, and quasi-static conditions. Rewrite the elastic solution entirely in terms of $G$ and $K$ so that $\\nu$ need not be assumed time-constant. Take the Laplace transform in time (for causal fields) of the governing equations and boundary data under initial rest, so that the viscoelastic constitutive law becomes multiplication in the Laplace variable $s$: $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}_{s}(\\mathbf{x},s)=\\left(2\\,G_{s}(s)\\,\\mathbb{I}_{\\mathrm{d}}+\\lambda_{s}(s)\\,\\mathbf{I}\\otimes\\mathbf{I}\\right):\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}_{s}(\\mathbf{x},s)$ with $\\lambda_{s}(s)=K_{s}(s)-\\frac{2}{3}G_{s}(s)$.

Replace the elastic Young’s modulus $E$ in the known elastic solution by the complex dynamic modulus $E^{\\ast}(\\omega)=E^{\\prime}(\\omega)+\\mathrm{i}E^{\\prime\\prime}(\\omega)$ obtained from sinusoidal testing, let $s=\\mathrm{i}\\omega$, and recover the time-domain response for arbitrary load histories by applying the inverse Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) to the resulting frequency-domain fields. Initial conditions can be neglected because the FFT enforces periodicity over a chosen time window.\n\nC. Take the known elastic solution written in terms of $E$ and a fixed Poisson’s ratio $\\nu$. Replace $E\\to E_{s}(s)$ in the elastic formulae while keeping $\\nu$ fixed at its elastic value for all $t$, regardless of whether $K(t)$ and $G(t)$ relax differently. Transform only the tractions $\\bar{\\mathbf{t}}(\\mathbf{x},t)$, since displacements on $\\Gamma_{u}$ are kinematic and therefore need not be transformed. Invert by a simple Post-Widder formula without further checks.\n\nD. Compute the Laplace transform of the known static elastic displacement field by multiplying by $1/s$ to account for time integration, then multiply by the Laplace transforms of the loads to obtain $\\mathbf{u}_{s}(\\mathbf{x},s)$, and invert using a fixed-step Gaver-Stehfest method. There is no need to modify the elastic moduli or to impose initial conditions explicitly because the quasi-static assumption renders the correspondence trivial.\n\nE.

Replace $J\\to J_{s}(s)$ in those expressions, leaving any occurrences of $E$ elsewhere unchanged, and then take the inverse Laplace transform by a numerical quadrature along a line parallel to the imaginary axis.

A solution will be derived.\n\nThe core of the problem is the elastic-viscoelastic correspondence principle. This principle arises from applying the Laplace transform to the governing equations of linear viscoelasticity for a body at rest at $t=0$. Let $\\mathcal{L}\\{f(t)\\}(s) = f_s(s) = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} f(t)e^{-st} \\mathrm{d}t$ denote the one-sided Laplace transform.\n\n1.  **Transforming Governing Equations**: The kinematic and equilibrium equations are linear differential operators in space, independent of time. Applying the Laplace transform with respect to time yields equations of identical form in the Laplace domain:\n    -   Kinematics: $\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}_{s}(\\mathbf{x},s) = \\frac{1}{2}(\\nabla \\mathbf{u}_{s}(\\mathbf{x},s) + \\nabla \\mathbf{u}_{s}(\\mathbf{x},s)^{\\top})$\n    -   Equilibrium: $\\nabla\\cdot\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}_{s}(\\mathbf{x},s) + \\mathbf{b}_{s}(\\mathbf{x},s) = \\mathbf{0}$\n    -   Boundary Conditions: $\\mathbf{u}_{s}(\\mathbf{x},s) = \\bar{\\mathbf{u}}_{s}(\\mathbf{x},s)$ on $\\Gamma_{u}$ and $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}_{s}(\\mathbf{x},s)\\cdot\\mathbf{n} = \\bar{\\mathbf{t}}_{s}(\\mathbf{x},s)$ on $\\Gamma_{t}$.\n\n2.  **Transforming the Constitutive Law**: This is the crucial step. The constitutive law is a convolution integral: $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}(t) = \\int_{0}^{t}\\mathbb{C}(t-\\tau):\\dot{\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}}(\\tau)\\,\\mathrm{d}\\tau$.\n    By the convolution theorem for Laplace transforms, $\\mathcal{L}\\{f*g\\} = f_s(s) g_s(s)$. The given law is a convolution of $\\mathbb{C}(t)$ and $\\dot{\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}}(t)$.\n    The transform of the strain rate is $\\mathcal{L}\\{\\dot{\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}}(t)\\} = s\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}_s(s) - \\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}(0)$. Since the body is at rest initially, $\\mathbf{u}(\\mathbf{x},0)=\\mathbf{0}$, which implies $\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}(\\mathbf{x},0)=\\mathbf{0}$. Therefore, $\\mathcal{L}\\{\\dot{\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}}(t)\\} = s\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}_s(s)$.\n    Applying the transform to the constitutive law gives:\n    $$\n    \\boldsymbol{\\sigma}_{s}(s) = \\mathcal{L}\\{\\mathbb{C}(t)\\} : [s \\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}_{s}(s)] = [s \\mathcal{L}\\{\\mathbb{C}(t)\\}] : \\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}_{s}(s)\n    $$\n    Let us define the Laplace-domain viscoelastic modulus tensor as $\\mathbb{C}_{s}(s) = s \\mathcal{L}\\{\\mathbb{C}(t)\\}$. The constitutive law becomes an algebraic relation:\n    $$\n    \\boldsymbol{\\sigma}_{s}(s) = \\mathbb{C}_{s}(s) : \\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}_{s}(s)\n    $$\n    For an isotropic material, $\\mathbb{C}(t) = 2G(t)\\mathbb{I}_{\\mathrm{d}} + \\lambda(t)\\mathbf{I}\\otimes\\mathbf{I}$. By linearity of the Laplace transform:\n    $$\n    \\mathbb{C}_{s}(s) = s \\mathcal{L}\\{2G(t)\\mathbb{I}_{\\mathrm{d}} + \\lambda(t)\\mathbf{I}\\otimes\\mathbf{I}\\} = 2 [s\\mathcal{L}\\{G(t)\\}] \\mathbb{I}_{\\mathrm{d}} + [s\\mathcal{L}\\{\\lambda(t)\\}] \\mathbf{I}\\otimes\\mathbf{I}\n    $$\n    Defining the s-multiplied transformed moduli $G_{s}(s) = s\\mathcal{L}\\{G(t)\\}$, $K_{s}(s) = s\\mathcal{L}\\{K(t)\\}$, and $\\lambda_{s}(s) = s\\mathcal{L}\\{\\lambda(t)\\}$, we have:\n    $$\n    \\mathbb{C}_{s}(s) = 2G_{s}(s)\\mathbb{I}_{\\mathrm{d}} + \\lambda_{s}(s)\\mathbf{I}\\otimes\\mathbf{I}\n    $$\n    and $\\lambda_{s}(s) = K_{s}(s) - \\frac{2}{3}G_{s}(s)$.\n\n3.  **The Correspondence Principle**: The full BVP in the Laplace domain is formally identical to a linear elastic BVP where the constant elastic moduli $G$ and $K$ are replaced by the complex, s-dependent functions $G_{s}(s)$ and $K_{s}(s)$, and the boundary data are replaced by their Laplace transforms. Therefore, if the elastic solution is known, e.g., $\\mathbf{u}_{el}(\\mathbf{x}; G, K; \\bar{\\mathbf{u}}, \\bar{\\mathbf{t}})$, the viscoelastic solution in the Laplace domain is obtained by direct substitution:\n    $$\n    \\mathbf{u}_{s}(\\mathbf{x},s) = \\mathbf{u}_{el}(\\mathbf{x}; G_{s}(s), K_{s}(s); \\bar{\\mathbf{u}}_{s}(s), \\bar{\\mathbf{t}}_{s}(s))\n    $$\n\n4.  **Inversion**: The final step is to recover the time-domain solution $\\mathbf{u}(\\mathbf{x},t)$ by computing the inverse Laplace transform of $\\mathbf{u}_{s}(\\mathbf{x},s)$. This is generally performed numerically using algorithms that evaluate the Bromwich integral along a suitable contour in the complex plane. Verification of the result against short-time and long-time limits via the initial and final value theorems is an essential check.\n\nNow we analyze the provided options based on this derivation.\n\n**A. Verify small strains, linearity, and quasi-static conditions. Rewrite the elastic solution entirely in terms of $G$ and $K$ so that $\\nu$ need not be assumed time-constant. Take the Laplace transform in time (for causal fields) of the governing equations and boundary data under initial rest, so that the viscoelastic constitutive law becomes multiplication in the Laplace variable $s$: $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}_{s}(\\mathbf{x},s)=\\left(2\\,G_{s}(s)\\,\\mathbb{I}_{\\mathrm{d}}+\\lambda_{s}(s)\\,\\mathbf{I}\\otimes\\mathbf{I}\\right):\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}_{s}(\\mathbf{x},s)$ with $\\lambda_{s}(s)=K_{s}(s)-\\frac{2}{3}G_{s}(s)$. Form the Laplace-domain BVP with the same differential operator as elasticity but with $G\\to G_{s}(s)$ and $K\\to K_{s}(s)$, and with transformed loads $\\bar{\\mathbf{u}}_{s}(\\mathbf{x},s)$, $\\bar{\\mathbf{t}}_{s}(\\mathbf{x},s)$. Obtain the Laplace-domain fields by substituting the known elastic solution formulae with the replacements $G\\to G_{s}(s)$, $K\\to K_{s}(s)$ applied algebraically to the closed-form expressions and carrying the transformed boundary data. Compute the inverse Laplace transform\n$$\n\\mathbf{u}(\\mathbf{x},t)=\\mathcal{L}^{-1}\\{\\mathbf{u}_{s}(\\mathbf{x},s)\\}(t)=\\frac{1}{2\\pi\\mathrm{i}}\\int_{\\gamma-\\mathrm{i}\\infty}^{\\gamma+\\mathrm{i}\\infty}\\mathrm{e}^{s t}\\,\\mathbf{u}_{s}(\\mathbf{x},s)\\,\\mathrm{d}s\n$$\nnumerically using a stable Bromwich-contour algorithm (for example, Talbot’s method or the de Hoog method), choosing $\\gamma$ larger than the abscissa of convergence of $G_{s}(s)$ and $K_{s}(s)$. Check a posteriori that the short-time and long-time limits coincide with the elastic solutions using the instantaneous moduli $G(0^{+})$, $K(0^{+})$ and the relaxed moduli $G(\\infty)$, $K(\\infty)$, and that the solution is causal.**\n\nThis option describes the entire procedure correctly and with necessary rigor. It correctly identifies the prerequisites, the transformation of equations and boundary conditions, the correct form of the s-domain constitutive law, and the proper substitutions ($G \\to G_s(s)$, $K \\to K_s(s)$). It makes a crucial point about using $G$ and $K$ instead of $E$ and $\\nu$ to avoid incorrect assumptions about a constant Poisson's ratio, since in general $\\nu_s(s) = \\frac{3K_s(s) - 2G_s(s)}{2(3K_s(s) + G_s(s))}$ is a function of $s$. It specifies robust numerical inversion techniques and the correct integration path. Finally, it includes the essential step of verification.\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\n**B. Replace the elastic Young’s modulus $E$ in the known elastic solution by the complex dynamic modulus $E^{\\ast}(\\omega)=E^{\\prime}(\\omega)+\\mathrm{i}E^{\\prime\\prime}(\\omega)$ obtained from sinusoidal testing, let $s=\\mathrm{i}\\omega$, and recover the time-domain response for arbitrary load histories by applying the inverse Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) to the resulting frequency-domain fields. Initial conditions can be neglected because the FFT enforces periodicity over a chosen time window.**\n\nThis option is flawed. The substitution $s=\\mathrm{i}\\omega$ and use of the complex modulus $E^*(\\omega)$ is appropriate for problems of steady-state sinusoidal response, which are solved using the Fourier transform. It is not the general method for transient problems with arbitrary causal load histories and initial rest conditions, for which the Laplace transform is required. Using FFT for a transient problem is a specialized numerical technique that requires careful windowing and handling of causality, and it does not simply involve replacing $E$ with $E^*(\\omega)$ in the static solution. The claim that initial conditions can be neglected is fundamentally incorrect for a transient problem starting from rest.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**C. Take the known elastic solution written in terms of $E$ and a fixed Poisson’s ratio $\\nu$. Replace $E\\to E_{s}(s)$ in the elastic formulae while keeping $\\nu$ fixed at its elastic value for all $t$, regardless of whether $K(t)$ and $G(t)$ relax differently. Transform only the tractions $\\bar{\\mathbf{t}}(\\mathbf{x},t)$, since displacements on $\\Gamma_{u}$ are kinematic and therefore need not be transformed. Invert by a simple Post-Widder formula without further checks.**\n\nThis option contains multiple severe errors. First, assuming a fixed Poisson's ratio $\\nu$ is generally incorrect unless it can be proven that the ratio $K(t)/G(t)$ is constant, which is a special case not assumed in the problem. If $K$ and $G$ relax differently, the viscoelastic Poisson's ratio is time-dependent. Second, stating that prescribed displacements $\\bar{\\mathbf{u}}$ need not be transformed is a grave error; all time-dependent inputs, including prescribed boundary data, must be transformed. Third, recommending the Post-Widder formula, which is often ill-conditioned, and explicitly advising against further checks is poor scientific practice. Robust numerical inversion is essential.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**D. Compute the Laplace transform of the known static elastic displacement field by multiplying by $1/s$ to account for time integration, then multiply by the Laplace transforms of the loads to obtain $\\mathbf{u}_{s}(\\mathbf{x},s)$, and invert using a fixed-step Gaver-Stehfest method. There is no need to modify the elastic moduli or to impose initial conditions explicitly because the quasi-static assumption renders the correspondence trivial.**\n\nThis procedure is completely wrong. It fundamentally misunderstands the principle. The most critical error is the statement that \"there is no need to modify the elastic moduli.\" The very essence of the correspondence principle is the replacement of elastic moduli with their s-domain viscoelastic counterparts. The suggested method of multiplying a static solution by the transform of the load is baseless. The quasi-static assumption simplifies the momentum equation by dropping the inertia term; it does not trivialize the material's time-dependent response.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**E. Rewrite the elastic solution entirely in terms of the elastic compliance $J=1/E$. Replace $J\\to J_{s}(s)$ in those expressions, leaving any occurrences of $E$ elsewhere unchanged, and then take the inverse Laplace transform by a numerical quadrature along a line parallel to the imaginary axis. Mixed boundary conditions in which the ratio of prescribed tractions to prescribed displacements is time-dependent are not admissible, so enforce purely traction or purely displacement boundaries to ensure validity.**\n\nThis option is also flawed. The instruction to replace $J$ with its transform $J_s(s)$ but \"leaving any occurrences of $E$ elsewhere unchanged\" is a logical contradiction, since $E = 1/J$. All instances of a material property must be replaced consistently. Furthermore, the claim that mixed boundary conditions with time-dependent data are \"not admissible\" is false. The correspondence principle is valid for general mixed boundary conditions, provided the boundary partitions $\\Gamma_u$ and $\\Gamma_t$ are fixed in time, which is the standard assumption.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\nBased on the detailed analysis, Option A is the only one that presents a complete and correct procedure consistent with the principles of linear viscoelasticity and transform methods.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2634945"}]}
