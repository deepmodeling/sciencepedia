The time-dependent strain, $\\varepsilon(t)$, and stress, $\\sigma(t)$, are sinusoidal with the same angular frequency, $\\omega$. We can represent the strain as the reference signal:\n$$ \\varepsilon(t) = \\varepsilon_{0} \\sin(\\omega t) $$\nwhere $\\varepsilon_{0}$ is the strain amplitude.

The task is to implement a specific, quantitative algorithm to determine the linear viscoelastic range (LVR) of a material from simulated Dynamic Mechanical Analysis (DMA) data. The problem is scientifically sound, internally consistent, and contains all necessary information for its resolution. We shall proceed with the solution.\n\nThe core of the problem is to distinguish between linear and nonlinear viscoelastic responses. A material is considered linear viscoelastic if, under a sinusoidal strain input $\\varepsilon(t) = \\varepsilon_{0}\\sin(\\omega t)$, the resultant stress $\\sigma(t)$ is also sinusoidal at the same angular frequency $\\omega$, possibly with a phase shift $\\delta$. This behavior is described by the complex modulus $E^{*}(\\omega) = E'(\\omega) + iE''(\\omega)$, where the storage modulus $E'$ and loss modulus $E''$ are independent of the strain amplitude $\\varepsilon_{0}$. When the material response becomes nonlinear, which typically occurs at larger strain amplitudes, the stress signal becomes distorted. This distortion manifests as the appearance of higher-order harmonics (at frequencies $3\\omega$, $5\\omega$, etc.) in the stress spectrum and a dependency of the apparent moduli $E'$ and $E''$ on $\\varepsilon_{0}$.\n\nThe algorithm to be implemented follows these principles.\n\nFirst, we generate the necessary time-domain signals. A discrete time vector $t$ is created over an integer number of cycles $N_{\\mathrm{cyc}}=8$ with a sufficient number of samples per cycle $N_{\\mathrm{ppc}}=1024$ to prevent aliasing and ensure accurate integration. The total number of points is $N=N_{\\mathrm{ppc}} \\times N_{\\mathrm{cyc}}$, and the total duration is $T = N_{\\mathrm{cyc}} / f$, where $f=1.0\\,\\mathrm{Hz}$ is the test frequency. For each strain amplitude $\\varepsilon_0$ in the specified sweep, the strain signal $\\varepsilon(t) = \\varepsilon_{0}\\sin(\\omega t)$ and its time derivative $\\dot{\\varepsilon}(t) = \\varepsilon_{0}\\omega\\cos(\\omega t)$ are computed, with $\\omega=2\\pi f$. The corresponding stress signal $\\sigma(t)$ is then synthesized using the provided generalized Kelvin-Voigt model with a cubic nonlinearity:\n$$\n\\sigma(t) = E\\,\\varepsilon(t) + \\eta\\,\\dot{\\varepsilon}(t) + k_{3}\\,\\varepsilon(t)^{3}\n$$\nwhere the parameters $E$, $\\eta$, and $k_3$ are given for each test case.\n\nSecond, we analyze the harmonic content of the generated stress signal $\\sigma(t)$. This is achieved by orthogonal projection, which is numerically implemented as a discrete Fourier analysis. For each harmonic of interest, with angular frequency $\\Omega_n = n\\omega$ for $n \\in \\{1, 3, 5\\}$, we compute the sine and cosine projection coefficients:\n$$\nC_{\\sin}(n\\omega) = \\frac{2}{N} \\sum_{i=0}^{N-1} \\sigma(t_i) \\sin(n\\omega t_i)\n$$\n$$\nC_{\\cos}(n\\omega) = \\frac{2}{N} \\sum_{i=0}^{N-1} \\sigma(t_i) \\cos(n\\omega t_i)\n$$\nThese formulae are the discrete-time equivalents of the continuous-time integral definitions provided in the problem, arising from a Riemann sum approximation over $N$ uniform samples. The amplitude of the $n$-th harmonic is then $A_n = \\sqrt{C_{\\sin}(n\\omega)^2 + C_{\\cos}(n\\omega)^2}$.\n\nFrom the fundamental harmonic ($n=1$) projections, the apparent storage and loss moduli are determined as:\n$$\nE'(\\varepsilon_0) = \\frac{C_{\\sin}(\\omega)}{\\varepsilon_0}\n$$\n$$\nE''(\\varepsilon_0) = \\frac{C_{\\cos}(\\omega)}{\\varepsilon_0}\n$$\nThese calculations are performed for every strain amplitude $\\varepsilon_0$ in the sweep.\n\nThird, we apply the two criteria to define the LVR. For each amplitude $\\varepsilon_0$:\n1.  **Harmonic Purity Criterion**: The ratios of the amplitudes of the $3$rd and $5$th harmonics to the fundamental, $R_3 = A_3/A_1$ and $R_5 = A_5/A_1$, must not exceed a tolerance $r_{\\max} = 2.0 \\times 10^{-2}$.\n2.  **Modulus Invariance Criterion**: The relative deviations of the storage and loss moduli from their reference values, $E'_{\\mathrm{ref}}$ and $E''_{\\mathrm{ref}}$ (measured at the lowest strain amplitude $\\varepsilon_{0,\\min}$), must not exceed a tolerance $\\tau_{\\mathrm{mod}} = 1.0 \\times 10^{-1}$. The conditions are:\n    $$\n    \\left|\\frac{E'(\\varepsilon_{0}) - E'_{\\mathrm{ref}}}{E'_{\\mathrm{ref}}}\\right| \\le \\tau_{\\mathrm{mod}} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\left|\\frac{E''(\\varepsilon_{0}) - E''_{\\mathrm{ref}}}{E''_{\\mathrm{ref}}}\\right| \\le \\tau_{\\mathrm{mod}}\n    $$\n\nFinally, the LVR is determined as the largest contiguous range of strain amplitudes, starting from $\\varepsilon_{0,\\min}$, for which both criteria are simultaneously satisfied. The algorithm iterates through the amplitudes in ascending order. The maximum acceptable strain amplitude is the largest value in this contiguous range. If the conditions are not met even for the smallest amplitude, the result is $0.0$. This procedure is systematically applied to each test case to derive the required results.", "answer": "```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves the problem of determining the linear viscoelastic range (LVR)\n    for materials under dynamic loading based on specified criteria.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    def calculate_max_strain(params):\n        \"\"\"\n        Calculates the maximum acceptable strain amplitude for a single test case.\n\n        Args:\n            params (dict): A dictionary containing material and test parameters:\n                           E, eta, k3, f, amplitudes, r_max, tau_mod.\n\n        Returns:\n            float: The maximum acceptable strain amplitude.\n        \"\"\"\n        # Unpack parameters\n        E = params['E']\n        eta = params['eta']\n        k3 = params['k3']\n        f = params['f']\n        amplitudes = params['amplitudes']\n        r_max = params['r_max']\n        tau_mod = params['tau_mod']\n\n        # Simulation parameters\n        N_ppc = 1024\n        N_cyc = 8\n        N = N_ppc * N_cyc\n        \n        # Time and frequency setup\n        omega = 2.0 * np.pi * f\n        T = N_cyc / f\n        dt = T / N\n        t = np.arange(N) * dt\n\n        # Store results for each amplitude\n        results_per_amp = []\n\n        for eps0 in amplitudes:\n            # Generate signals\n            strain = eps0 * np.sin(omega * t)\n            strain_rate = eps0 * omega * np.cos(omega * t)\n            stress = E * strain + eta * strain_rate + k3 * (strain**3)\n\n            harmonic_data = {}\n            for n in [1, 3, 5]:\n                omega_n = n * omega\n                \n                # Orthogonal projection using discrete summation\n                sin_proj = (2.0 / N) * np.sum(stress * np.sin(omega_n * t))\n                cos_proj = (2.0 / N) * np.sum(stress * np.cos(omega_n * t))\n                \n                amplitude_n = np.sqrt(sin_proj**2 + cos_proj**2)\n                \n                harmonic_data[n] = {\n                    'sin_proj': sin_proj,\n                    'cos_proj': cos_proj,\n                    'amp': amplitude_n\n                }\n\n            # Calculate moduli from fundamental harmonic\n            E_prime = harmonic_data[1]['sin_proj'] / eps0\n            E_double_prime = harmonic_data[1]['cos_proj'] / eps0\n\n            results_per_amp.append({\n                'eps0': eps0,\n                'E_prime': E_prime,\n                'E_double_prime': E_double_prime,\n                'A1': harmonic_data[1]['amp'],\n                'A3': harmonic_data[3]['amp'],\n                'A5': harmonic_data[5]['amp']\n            })\n\n        # Apply LVR criteria\n        if not results_per_amp:\n            return 0.0\n\n        # Reference values from the smallest amplitude\n        ref_result = results_per_amp[0]\n        E_prime_ref = ref_result['E_prime']\n        E_double_prime_ref = ref_result['E_double_prime']\n        \n        # Handle potential zero reference values, though not expected here\n        if E_prime_ref == 0.0 or E_double_prime_ref == 0.0:\n            # This case implies a purely viscous or elastic material with zero E' or E''.\n            # The relative error check is ill-defined.
