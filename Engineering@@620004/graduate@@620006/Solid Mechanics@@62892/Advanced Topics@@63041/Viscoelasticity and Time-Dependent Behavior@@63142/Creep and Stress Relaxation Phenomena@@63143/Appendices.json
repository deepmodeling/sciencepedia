It is well-posed, scientifically grounded, and contains all necessary information for its resolution. The premises are consistent with the fundamental principles of solid mechanics. Therefore, the problem is valid, and we proceed with the derivation.\n\nThe behavior of the Maxwell element is governed by the relationships for its constituent components—a linear elastic spring and a linear viscous dashpot—and the rules of their series connection.\n\nThe given relations are:\n1. Spring constitutive law: $\\sigma(t) = E \\epsilon_{s}(t)$\n2. Dashpot constitutive law: $\\sigma(t) = \\eta \\dot{\\epsilon}_{d}(t)$, where $\\dot{\\epsilon}_{d}(t) = \\frac{d\\epsilon_{d}}{dt}$\n3. Series strain additivity: $\\epsilon(t) = \\epsilon_{s}(t) + \\epsilon_{d}(t)$\n\nThe stress $\\sigma(t)$ is uniform across both elements. From relation (1), the spring strain is $\\epsilon_{s}(t) = \\frac{\\sigma(t)}{E}$. Differentiating this with respect to time gives the spring strain rate: $\\dot{\\epsilon}_{s}(t) = \\frac{\\dot{\\sigma}(t)}{E}$. From relation (2), the dashpot strain rate is $\\dot{\\epsilon}_{d}(t) = \\frac{\\sigma(t)}{\\eta}$.\n\nWe differentiate the strain additivity rule (3) with respect to time $t$:\n$$\n\\dot{\\epsilon}(t) = \\dot{\\epsilon}_{s}(t) + \\dot{\\epsilon}_{d}(t)\n$$\nSubstituting the expressions for the individual strain rates yields the governing differential equation for the Maxwell model, which relates the total stress $\\sigma(t)$ to the total strain $\\epsilon(t)$:\n$$\n\\dot{\\epsilon}(t) = \\frac{\\dot{\\sigma}(t)}{E} + \\frac{\\sigma(t)}{\\eta}\n$$\nThis is a first-order linear ordinary differential equation. We can rearrange it into the standard form:\n$$\n\\dot{\\sigma}(t) + \\frac{E}{\\eta}\\sigma(t) = E \\dot{\\epsilon}(t)\n$$\n\nFirst, we derive the creep compliance $J(t)$. A creep experiment involves applying a step stress $\\sigma(t) = \\sigma_{0} H(t)$, where $H(t)$ is the Heaviside step function. We must find the resulting strain $\\epsilon(t)$. For $t > 0$, the stress is constant, $\\sigma(t) = \\sigma_{0}$, which implies $\\dot{\\sigma}(t) = 0$. The governing equation simplifies to:\n$$\n\\dot{\\epsilon}(t) = \\frac{0}{E} + \\frac{\\sigma_{0}}{\\eta} = \\frac{\\sigma_{0}}{\\eta}\n$$\nIntegrating with respect to time from $t=0^{+}$ gives:\n$$\n\\epsilon(t) = \\frac{\\sigma_{0}}{\\eta}t + C\n$$\nThe integration constant $C$ is determined from the initial condition at $t=0^{+}$. At the instant of load application, the viscous dashpot cannot respond, as viscous flow requires finite time. Thus, $\\epsilon_{d}(0^{+}) = 0$. The initial strain response is purely elastic and is borne entirely by the spring:\n$$\n\\epsilon(0^{+}) = \\epsilon_{s}(0^{+}) = \\frac{\\sigma(0^{+})}{E} = \\frac{\\sigma_{0}}{E}\n$$\nEvaluating our solution for $\\epsilon(t)$ at $t=0^{+}$ yields $\\epsilon(0^{+}) = C$. Therefore, $C = \\frac{\\sigma_{0}}{E}$. The strain response for $t \\ge 0$ is:\n$$\n\\epsilon(t) = \\sigma_{0} \\left( \\frac{1}{E} + \\frac{t}{\\eta} \\right)\n$$\nBy definition, the creep compliance $J(t)$ is given by $\\epsilon(t) = J(t)\\sigma_{0}$. Comparing the expressions gives:\n$$\nJ(t) = \\frac{1}{E} + \\frac{t}{\\eta}\n$$\n\nSecond, we derive the relaxation modulus $G(t)$. A stress relaxation experiment involves applying a step strain $\\epsilon(t) = \\epsilon_{0} H(t)$. We must find the resulting stress $\\sigma(t)$. The strain rate is $\\dot{\\epsilon}(t) = \\epsilon_{0} \\delta(t)$, where $\\delta(t)$ is the Dirac delta distribution. Substituting this into the governing equation:\n$$\n\\dot{\\sigma}(t) + \\frac{E}{\\eta}\\sigma(t) = E \\epsilon_{0} \\delta(t)\n$$\nFor $t > 0$, the delta function is zero, and the equation becomes homogeneous:\n$$\n\\dot{\\sigma}(t) + \\frac{E}{\\eta}\\sigma(t) = 0\n$$\nThe solution to this first-order homogeneous ODE is of the form:\n$$\n\\sigma(t) = A \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E}{\\eta}t\\right)\n$$\nThe constant $A$ is the initial stress $\\sigma(0^{+})$. To find this, we integrate the full inhomogeneous ODE from $t=0^{-}$ to $t=0^{+}$. Assuming the system is quiescent for $t<0$, $\\sigma(0^{-})=0$.\n$$\n\\int_{0^{-}}^{0^{+}} \\left(\\dot{\\sigma}(t) + \\frac{E}{\\eta}\\sigma(t)\\right) dt = \\int_{0^{-}}^{0^{+}} E\\epsilon_{0}\\delta(t) dt\n$$\n$$\n[\\sigma(0^{+}) - \\sigma(0^{-})] + \\frac{E}{\\eta} \\int_{0^{-}}^{0^{+}} \\sigma(t) dt = E\\epsilon_{0}\n$$\nThe integral of a non-distributional function $\\sigma(t)$ over an infinitesimal interval is zero. This leaves $\\sigma(0^{+}) = E\\epsilon_{0}$. This initial stress corresponds to the purely elastic response of the spring to the instantaneous strain $\\epsilon_{0}$.\nSubstituting this into the solution for $\\sigma(t)$, we find $A = E\\epsilon_{0}$. The stress response for $t \\ge 0$ is:\n$$\n\\sigma(t) = E\\epsilon_{0} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E}{\\eta}t\\right)\n$$\nBy definition, the relaxation modulus $G(t)$ is given by $\\sigma(t) = G(t)\\epsilon_{0}$. By comparison:\n$$\nG(t) = E \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E}{\\eta}t\\right)\n$$\n\nFinally, we interpret the asymptotic limits.\n\nFor the creep compliance $J(t) = \\frac{1}{E} + \\frac{t}{\\eta}$:\n- The short-time limit is $J(0^{+}) = \\lim_{t \\to 0^{+}} \\left(\\frac{1}{E} + \\frac{t}{\\eta}\\right) = \\frac{1}{E}$. This is the instantaneous elastic compliance. Experimentally, it represents the immediate strain measured upon application of the step load, corresponding to the pure elastic deformation of the material before viscous flow begins.\n- The long-time limit is $J(\\infty) = \\lim_{t \\to \\infty} \\left(\\frac{1}{E} + \\frac{t}{\\eta}\\right) = \\infty$. This indicates that the material flows indefinitely under constant stress, behaving as a viscous fluid. Experimentally, after the initial elastic response, the material would exhibit a constant strain rate, $\\dot{\\epsilon} = \\sigma_{0}/\\eta$, characteristic of steady-state viscous flow.\n\nFor the relaxation modulus $G(t) = E \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E}{\\eta}t\\right)$:\n- The short-time limit is $G(0^{+}) = \\lim_{t \\to 0^{+}} E \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E}{\\eta}t\\right) = E$. This is the instantaneous elastic modulus. Experimentally, it is the peak stress measured immediately upon application of the step strain, before any stress relaxation can occur.\n- The long-time limit is $G(\\infty) = \\lim_{t \\to \\infty} E \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E}{\\eta}t\\right) = 0$. This indicates that the stress completely dissipates over time as the fixed strain is accommodated by viscous flow. Experimentally, this manifests as the stress in the sample decaying asymptotically to zero while being held at a constant deformation.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{1}{E} + \\frac{t}{\\eta} & E \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E t}{\\eta}\\right) \\end{pmatrix}}\n$$", "id": "2627397"}, {"introduction": "Having examined a viscoelastic fluid, we now turn to its counterpart: the viscoelastic solid, best exemplified by the Kelvin-Voigt model.

A complete solution will be provided.\n\nThe analysis proceeds by addressing the three tasks in sequence.\n\nFirst, we derive the governing differential equation for the Kelvin–Voigt model. The model consists of a spring and a dashpot arranged in parallel. This arrangement imposes specific constraints on the kinematics and statics of the system.\n\n$1$. Kinematic Compatibility: For elements in parallel, the strain is the same across each branch and is equal to the total strain of the model. Let $\\varepsilon(t)$ be the total strain, $\\varepsilon_{E}(t)$ be the strain in the spring, and $\\varepsilon_{\\eta}(t)$ be the strain in the dashpot. Then,\n$$ \\varepsilon(t) = \\varepsilon_{E}(t) = \\varepsilon_{\\eta}(t) $$\n\n$2$. Static Additivity: For elements in parallel, the total stress is the sum of the stresses carried by each element. Let $\\sigma(t)$ be the total stress, $\\sigma_{E}(t)$ be the stress in the spring, and $\\sigma_{\\eta}(t)$ be the stress in the dashpot. Then,\n$$ \\sigma(t) = \\sigma_{E}(t) + \\sigma_{\\eta}(t) $$\n\nThe constitutive laws for the individual elements are the linear spring law (Hooke's law) and the linear viscous dashpot law (Newtonian fluid).\n- Spring: $\\sigma_{E}(t) = E \\varepsilon_{E}(t) = E \\varepsilon(t)$\n- Dashpot: $\\sigma_{\\eta}(t) = \\eta \\frac{d\\varepsilon_{\\eta}(t)}{dt} = \\eta \\frac{d\\varepsilon(t)}{dt}$\n\nSubstituting these constitutive relations into the static additivity equation yields the governing differential equation for the Kelvin–Voigt model:\n$$ \\sigma(t) = E \\varepsilon(t) + \\eta \\frac{d\\varepsilon(t)}{dt} $$\nThis completes the first task.\n\nSecond, we solve this differential equation to find the strain response $\\varepsilon(t)$ under a constant applied stress $\\sigma_{0}$ for $t \\ge 0$. The loading condition is $\\sigma(t) = \\sigma_{0}$ for all $t \\ge 0$. The differential equation becomes:\n$$ \\eta \\frac{d\\varepsilon}{dt} + E \\varepsilon = \\sigma_{0} $$\nThis is a first-order linear non-homogeneous ordinary differential equation. We can rearrange it into standard form:\n$$ \\frac{d\\varepsilon}{dt} + \\frac{E}{\\eta} \\varepsilon = \\frac{\\sigma_{0}}{\\eta} $$\nThe initial condition is required for a unique solution. The problem states the body is \"initially quiescent and stress free for $t<0$\". This implies $\\varepsilon(t) = 0$ for $t < 0$. Strain cannot change instantaneously in this model without an infinite stress (as will be discussed later), so strain must be continuous at $t=0$. Therefore, the initial condition is $\\varepsilon(0) = \\varepsilon(0^{-}) = 0$.\n\nThe general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution, $\\varepsilon_{h}(t)$, and a particular solution, $\\varepsilon_{p}(t)$.\nThe homogeneous equation is $\\frac{d\\varepsilon_{h}}{dt} + \\frac{E}{\\eta} \\varepsilon_{h} = 0$. The solution is of the form:\n$$ \\varepsilon_{h}(t) = A \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E}{\\eta} t\\right) $$\nwhere $A$ is a constant of integration.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the forcing term $\\frac{\\sigma_{0}}{\\eta}$ is a constant, we assume a constant particular solution $\\varepsilon_{p}(t) = C$. Substituting into the non-homogeneous equation gives:\n$$ 0 + \\frac{E}{\\eta} C = \\frac{\\sigma_{0}}{\\eta} \\implies C = \\frac{\\sigma_{0}}{E} $$\nSo, the particular solution is $\\varepsilon_{p}(t) = \\frac{\\sigma_{0}}{E}$.\n\nThe general solution for the strain is:\n$$ \\varepsilon(t) = \\varepsilon_{h}(t) + \\varepsilon_{p}(t) = A \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E}{\\eta} t\\right) + \\frac{\\sigma_{0}}{E} $$\nWe apply the initial condition $\\varepsilon(0) = 0$ to determine the constant $A$:\n$$ \\varepsilon(0) = A \\exp(0) + \\frac{\\sigma_{0}}{E} = A + \\frac{\\sigma_{0}}{E} = 0 \\implies A = -\\frac{\\sigma_{0}}{E} $$\nSubstituting the value of $A$ back into the general solution gives the final closed-form expression for the strain response, known as creep:\n$$ \\varepsilon(t) = \\frac{\\sigma_{0}}{E} - \\frac{\\sigma_{0}}{E} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E}{\\eta} t\\right) $$\nThis can be written more compactly as:\n$$ \\varepsilon(t) = \\frac{\\sigma_{0}}{E} \\left(1 - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E t}{\\eta}\\right)\\right) $$\nThis result describes how the material strain gradually increases, or creeps, over time from an initial value of $0$ to an asymptotic equilibrium value of $\\frac{\\sigma_{0}}{E}$, which is the strain the spring would have if it were alone. The characteristic time for this creep process is the retardation time, $\\tau = \\frac{\\eta}{E}$. This completes the second task.\n\nThird, we justify from first principles why the Kelvin–Voigt model cannot capture stress relaxation. A stress relaxation test involves imposing an instantaneous, constant strain $\\varepsilon_{0}$ at $t=0$ and observing the subsequent stress $\\sigma(t)$ for $t > 0$. From first principles, to impose an instantaneous strain $\\varepsilon_{0}$ requires an infinite strain rate, $\\frac{d\\varepsilon}{dt} \\to \\infty$, at $t=0$. According to the dashpot law $\\sigma_{\\eta} = \\eta \\frac{d\\varepsilon}{dt}$, this implies an infinite resistive stress from the dashpot, which is physically impossible. For any $t>0$, the strain is constant ($\\varepsilon(t) = \\varepsilon_{0}$), so the strain rate is zero ($\\frac{d\\varepsilon}{dt} = 0$). The governing equation $\\sigma(t) = E\\varepsilon(t) + \\eta \\frac{d\\varepsilon}{dt}$ then predicts that for $t>0$, the stress is simply $\\sigma(t) = E \\varepsilon_{0}$, a constant. The model thus fails to predict the characteristic decay of stress over time, which defines stress relaxation.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\frac{\\sigma_{0}}{E} \\left(1 - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E t}{\\eta}\\right)\\right)}\n$$", "id": "2627369"}, {"introduction": "To bridge the gap between idealized models and real-world engineering applications, we must advance to more sophisticated descriptions and computational methods.

A rigorous solution will be constructed.\n\nThe derivation proceeds systematically through the four specified tasks.\n\n**1. Derivation of the Evolution Equation for a Maxwell Branch**\n\nThe analysis begins with the kinematic relation for a single Maxwell branch, denoted by subscript $k$:\n$$\n\\varepsilon(t) = \\varepsilon_{k}^{e}(t) + \\varepsilon_{k}^{v}(t)\n$$\nHere, $\\varepsilon(t)$ is the total strain applied to the branch, $\\varepsilon_{k}^{e}(t)$ is the strain in the spring component, and $\\varepsilon_{k}^{v}(t)$ is the strain in the dashpot component.

Discretization and Update Formula for Branch Stress**\n\nWe discretize the derived differential equation over the time interval $[t_{n}, t_{n+1}]$ using the backward Euler method. This implicit scheme evaluates all terms at the end of the interval, $t_{n+1}$.

Substituting this and the update formula for $\\sigma_{k}^{n+1}$ from the previous step gives the total stress update:\n$$\n\\sigma^{n+1} = E_{0}\\,\\varepsilon^{n+1} + \\sum_{k=1}^{N} \\left(\\frac{\\sigma_{k}^{n} + E_{k}\\,\\Delta \\varepsilon}{1 + \\frac{\\Delta t}{\\tau_{k}}}\\right)\n$$\nTo prepare for the next step, we express $\\Delta \\varepsilon = \\varepsilon^{n+1} - \\varepsilon^{n}$:\n$$\n\\sigma^{n+1} = E_{0}\\,\\varepsilon^{n+1} + \\sum_{k=1}^{N} \\frac{\\sigma_{k}^{n} + E_{k}(\\varepsilon^{n+1} - \\varepsilon^{n})}{1 + \\frac{\\Delta t}{\\tau_{k}}}\n$$\n\n**4. Derivation of the Algorithmic Consistent Tangent Modulus**\n\nThe algorithmic tangent modulus, $E_{\\text{alg}}$, is defined as the exact linearization of the stress update rule with respect to the total strain at the end of the step, $\\varepsilon^{n+1}$. All quantities at time $t_n$ (i.e., $\\varepsilon^{n}$ and $\\sigma_{k}^{n}$ for all $k$) are held constant during this differentiation.\n$$\nE_{\\text{alg}} = \\frac{\\partial \\sigma^{n+1}}{\\partial \\varepsilon^{n+1}}\n$$\nWe apply this differentiation to the total stress expression derived in step 3:\n$$\nE_{\\text{alg}} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\varepsilon^{n+1}} \\left( E_{0}\\,\\varepsilon^{n+1} + \\sum_{k=1}^{N} \\frac{\\sigma_{k}^{n} + E_{k}(\\varepsilon^{n+1} - \\varepsilon^{n})}{1 + \\frac{\\Delta t}{\\tau_{k}}} \\right)\n$$\nThe derivative of a sum is the sum of the derivatives. We proceed term-by-term.\nThe derivative of the equilibrium spring contribution is:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\varepsilon^{n+1}} (E_{0}\\,\\varepsilon^{n+1}) = E_{0}\n$$\nFor the summation term, we can move the derivative operator inside the sum:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\varepsilon^{n+1}} \\sum_{k=1}^{N} \\dots = \\sum_{k=1}^{N} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\varepsilon^{n+1}} \\left( \\frac{\\sigma_{k}^{n} + E_{k}(\\varepsilon^{n+1} - \\varepsilon^{n})}{1 + \\frac{\\Delta t}{\\tau_{k}}} \\right)\n$$\nThe denominator $(1 + \\frac{\\Delta t}{\\tau_{k}})$ is constant with respect to $\\varepsilon^{n+1}$. The term $\\sigma_{k}^{n}$ is a history variable and is constant. The term $E_{k}\\,\\varepsilon^{n}$ is also constant. Therefore, the derivative of the numerator is:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\varepsilon^{n+1}} (\\sigma_{k}^{n} + E_{k}\\,\\varepsilon^{n+1} - E_{k}\\,\\varepsilon^{n}) = 0 + E_{k} - 0 = E_{k}\n$$\nThus, the derivative of the term for branch $k$ is:\n$$\n\\frac{E_{k}}{1 + \\frac{\\Delta t}{\\tau_{k}}} = \\frac{E_{k}\\tau_{k}}{\\tau_{k} + \\Delta t}\n$$\nCombining all parts, the final expression for the algorithmic tangent modulus is:\n$$\nE_{\\text{alg}} = E_{0} + \\sum_{k=1}^{N} \\frac{E_{k}}{1 + \\frac{\\Delta t}{\\tau_{k}}} = E_{0} + \\sum_{k=1}^{N} \\frac{E_{k}\\tau_{k}}{\\tau_{k} + \\Delta t}\n$$\nThis is the required closed-form analytical expression for the consistent tangent modulus.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{E_{0} + \\sum_{k=1}^{N} \\frac{E_{k} \\tau_{k}}{\\tau_{k} + \\Delta t}}\n$$", "id": "2627409"}]}
