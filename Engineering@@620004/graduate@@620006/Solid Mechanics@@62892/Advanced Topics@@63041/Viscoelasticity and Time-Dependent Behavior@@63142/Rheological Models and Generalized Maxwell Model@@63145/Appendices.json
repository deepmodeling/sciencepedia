The parameter $\\dot{\\epsilon}_{0}$ is a positive constant strain rate, and $H(t)$ is the Heaviside step function. The analysis will proceed by deriving the governing constitutive equation for each model and then solving it for the specified strain history.

The strain rate for $t>0$ is $\\dot{\\epsilon}(t) = \\frac{d}{dt}(\\dot{\\epsilon}_{0}t) = \\dot{\\epsilon}_{0}$.\n\nFirst, the Maxwell model is considered. This model consists of a linear elastic spring with modulus $E_{M}$ and a linear viscous dashpot with viscosity $\\eta_{M}$ connected in series. For a series connection, the total strain $\\epsilon$ is the sum of the strains in the spring, $\\epsilon_s$, and the dashpot, $\\epsilon_d$, while the stress $\\sigma$ is uniform throughout.\n$$ \\epsilon(t) = \\epsilon_s(t) + \\epsilon_d(t) $$\n$$ \\sigma(t) = \\sigma_s(t) = \\sigma_d(t) $$\nThe constitutive laws for the individual elements are $\\sigma(t) = E_{M}\\epsilon_s(t)$ for the spring and $\\sigma(t) = \\eta_{M}\\dot{\\epsilon}_d(t)$ for the dashpot, where the dot denotes differentiation with respect to time $t$. Differentiating the total strain equation with respect to time gives $\\dot{\\epsilon} = \\dot{\\epsilon}_s + \\dot{\\epsilon}_d$. Substituting the constitutive laws yields the governing ordinary differential equation (ODE) for the Maxwell model:\n$$ \\dot{\\epsilon}(t) = \\frac{\\dot{\\sigma}(t)}{E_{M}} + \\frac{\\sigma(t)}{\\eta_{M}} $$\nFor $t>0$, $\\dot{\\epsilon}(t) = \\dot{\\epsilon}_{0}$. The ODE becomes $\\dot{\\epsilon}_{0} = \\frac{\\dot{\\sigma}(t)}{E_{M}} + \\frac{\\sigma(t)}{\\eta_{M}}$. Defining the relaxation time $\\tau_{M} = \\eta_{M}/E_{M}$, this first-order linear ODE can be written as:\n$$ \\dot{\\sigma}(t) + \\frac{1}{\\tau_{M}}\\sigma(t) = E_{M}\\dot{\\epsilon}_{0} $$\nThe solution is the sum of a homogeneous solution, $\\sigma_h(t) = C\\exp(-t/\\tau_{M})$, and a particular solution. For a constant forcing term, we assume a constant particular solution $\\sigma_p(t) = A$, which gives $A/\\tau_{M} = E_{M}\\dot{\\epsilon}_{0}$, so $A = E_{M}\\dot{\\epsilon}_{0}\\tau_{M} = \\eta_{M}\\dot{\\epsilon}_{0}$. The general solution is $\\sigma(t) = \\eta_{M}\\dot{\\epsilon}_{0} + C\\exp(-t/\\tau_{M})$. The constant $C$ is determined from the initial condition $\\sigma(0^{+})=0$. This yields $0 = \\eta_{M}\\dot{\\epsilon}_{0} + C$, so $C = -\\eta_{M}\\dot{\\epsilon}_{0}$. The stress response for $t>0$ is:\n$$ \\sigma_{M}(t) = \\eta_{M}\\dot{\\epsilon}_{0}\\left(1 - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{t}{\\tau_{M}}\\right)\\right) = \\eta_{M}\\dot{\\epsilon}_{0}\\left(1 - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_{M}}{\\eta_{M}}t\\right)\\right) $$\nAs $t \\to 0^{+}$, a Taylor expansion $\\exp(-x) \\approx 1-x$ gives $\\sigma_{M}(t) \\approx \\eta_{M}\\dot{\\epsilon}_{0}(t/\\tau_{M}) = E_{M}\\dot{\\epsilon}_{0}t = E_{M}\\epsilon(t)$. This indicates an initial purely elastic response, as the dashpot has no time to flow. As $t \\to \\infty$, $\\exp(-t/\\tau_{M}) \\to 0$, so $\\sigma_{M}(t) \\to \\eta_{M}\\dot{\\epsilon}_{0}$. The stress reaches a steady-state value, characteristic of viscous fluid flow where the spring is at a constant extension and all further deformation occurs in the dashpot.\n\nSecond, the Kelvin–Voigt model is analyzed. This model comprises a spring of modulus $E_{K}$ and a dashpot of viscosity $\\eta_{K}$ in a parallel arrangement. For a parallel connection, the strain $\\epsilon$ is the same for both elements, while the total stress $\\sigma$ is the sum of the stresses in the spring, $\\sigma_s$, and the dashpot, $\\sigma_d$.\n$$ \\epsilon(t) = \\epsilon_s(t) = \\epsilon_d(t) $$\n$$ \\sigma(t) = \\sigma_s(t) + \\sigma_d(t) $$\nWith element laws $\\sigma_s(t) = E_{K}\\epsilon(t)$ and $\\sigma_d(t) = \\eta_{K}\\dot{\\epsilon}(t)$, the constitutive equation is algebraic:\n$$ \\sigma(t) = E_{K}\\epsilon(t) + \\eta_{K}\\dot{\\epsilon}(t) $$\nFor $t>0$, we substitute $\\epsilon(t) = \\dot{\\epsilon}_{0}t$ and $\\dot{\\epsilon}(t) = \\dot{\\epsilon}_{0}$ directly into the equation:\n$$ \\sigma_{K}(t) = E_{K}(\\dot{\\epsilon}_{0}t) + \\eta_{K}\\dot{\\epsilon}_{0} = \\dot{\\epsilon}_{0}(E_{K}t + \\eta_{K}) $$\nAs $t \\to 0^{+}$, $\\sigma_{K}(t) \\to \\eta_{K}\\dot{\\epsilon}_{0}$. There is an instantaneous stress response due to the dashpot resisting the onset of motion. As $t \\to \\infty$, the stress grows linearly with time, $\\sigma_{K}(t) \\approx E_{K}\\dot{\\epsilon}_{0}t$, dominated by the spring's response to the increasing strain. This behavior is characteristic of a solid.\n\nThird, the Generalized Maxwell model, represented by a Prony series for the relaxation modulus $E(t)=E_{\\infty}+\\sum_{k=1}^{N}E_{k}\\exp(-t/\\tau_{k})$ for $t>0$, is considered. The stress response is given by the Boltzmann superposition principle:\n$$ \\sigma(t) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{t} E(t-s) \\frac{d\\epsilon(s)}{ds} ds $$\nThe strain rate is $\\frac{d\\epsilon}{ds} = \\frac{d}{ds}(\\dot{\\epsilon}_{0}sH(s)) = \\dot{\\epsilon}_{0}H(s) + \\dot{\\epsilon}_{0}s\\delta(s)$, where $\\delta(s)$ is the Dirac delta function. Since $s\\delta(s) = 0$, we have $\\dot{\\epsilon}(s) = \\dot{\\epsilon}_{0}H(s)$. The integral becomes, for $t>0$:\n$$ \\sigma_{GM}(t) = \\int_{0}^{t} E(t-s) \\dot{\\epsilon}_{0} ds = \\dot{\\epsilon}_{0} \\int_{0}^{t} \\left( E_{\\infty} + \\sum_{k=1}^{N}E_{k}\\exp\\left(-\\frac{t-s}{\\tau_{k}}\\right) \\right) ds $$\nEvaluating the integral term-wise:\n$$ \\int_{0}^{t} E_{\\infty} ds = E_{\\infty}t $$\n$$ \\int_{0}^{t} E_{k}\\exp\\left(-\\frac{t-s}{\\tau_{k}}\\right) ds = E_{k}\\exp\\left(-\\frac{t}{\\tau_{k}}\\right)\\int_{0}^{t}\\exp\\left(\\frac{s}{\\tau_{k}}\\right)ds = E_{k}\\exp\\left(-\\frac{t}{\\tau_{k}}\\right)\\left[\\tau_{k}\\exp\\left(\\frac{s}{\\tau_{k}}\\right)\\right]_{0}^{t} $$\n$$ = E_{k}\\exp\\left(-\\frac{t}{\\tau_{k}}\\right)\\tau_{k}\\left(\\exp\\left(\\frac{t}{\\tau_{k}}\\right) - 1\\right) = E_{k}\\tau_{k}\\left(1 - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{t}{\\tau_{k}}\\right)\\right) $$\nCombining the terms, the stress response for $t>0$ is:\n$$ \\sigma_{GM}(t) = \\dot{\\epsilon}_{0}\\left[ E_{\\infty}t + \\sum_{k=1}^{N}E_{k}\\tau_{k}\\left(1 - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{t}{\\tau_{k}}\\right)\\right) \\right] $$\nAs $t \\to 0^{+}$, using $1-\\exp(-x) \\approx x$, the sum becomes $\\sum_{k=1}^{N}E_{k}\\tau_{k}(t/\\tau_{k}) = t\\sum_{k=1}^{N}E_{k}$. The stress becomes $\\sigma_{GM}(t) \\approx \\dot{\\epsilon}_{0}(E_{\\infty}t + t\\sum E_k) = (E_{\\infty} + \\sum E_k)\\dot{\\epsilon}_{0}t$. This is $\\sigma_{GM}(t) \\approx E(0)\\epsilon(t)$, a purely elastic response with the instantaneous modulus $E(0)$. As $t \\to \\infty$, $\\exp(-t/\\tau_k) \\to 0$. The stress behaves as $\\sigma_{GM}(t) \\approx \\dot{\\epsilon}_{0}\\left( E_{\\infty}t + \\sum_{k=1}^{N}E_{k}\\tau_{k} \\right)$. If $E_{\\infty}>0$, the material behaves as a solid, with stress growing linearly with time.

It is a well-posed problem in the field of solid mechanics, grounded in the established theory of linear viscoelasticity. It is free from scientific error, ambiguity, or contradiction. We shall now proceed with its solution.\n\n### a) Derivation of $G'(\\omega)$ and $G''(\\omega)$\n\nThe relationship between the complex shear modulus $G^\\ast(\\omega)$ and the relaxation modulus $G(t)$ for a linear viscoelastic material is given by the one-sided Fourier transform:\n$$\nG^\\ast(\\omega) = G_{\\infty} + i\\omega \\int_{0}^{\\infty} (G(t) - G_{\\infty}) e^{-i\\omega t} dt\n$$\nwhere $i = \\sqrt{-1}$ is the imaginary unit, $\\omega$ is the angular frequency, and $G_{\\infty} = \\lim_{t\\to\\infty} G(t)$ is the equilibrium modulus.\n\nThe problem specifies the generalized Maxwell model, also known as a Prony series, for the relaxation modulus:\n$$\nG(t) = G_{\\infty} + \\sum_{i=1}^{N} G_{i} e^{-t/\\tau_{i}}\n$$\nwhere $G_{i}$ are the modal shear moduli and $\\tau_{i}$ are the corresponding relaxation times. From this, we have:\n$$\nG(t) - G_{\\infty} = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} G_{i} e^{-t/\\tau_{i}}\n$$\nSubstituting this into the expression for $G^\\ast(\\omega)$:\n$$\nG^\\ast(\\omega) = G_{\\infty} + i\\omega \\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\left( \\sum_{i=1}^{N} G_{i} e^{-t/\\tau_{i}} \\right) e^{-i\\omega t} dt\n$$\nBy linearity of the integral, we can exchange the summation and integration:\n$$\nG^\\ast(\\omega) = G_{\\infty} + \\sum_{i=1}^{N} G_{i} \\left( i\\omega \\int_{0}^{\\infty} e^{-t/\\tau_{i}} e^{-i\\omega t} dt \\right)\n$$\nThe integral is evaluated as:\n$$\n\\int_{0}^{\\infty} e^{-(1/\\tau_{i} + i\\omega)t} dt = \\left[ \\frac{e^{-(1/\\tau_{i} + i\\omega)t}}{-(1/\\tau_{i} + i\\omega)} \\right]_{0}^{\\infty} = 0 - \\frac{1}{-(1/\\tau_{i} + i\\omega)} = \\frac{1}{1/\\tau_{i} + i\\omega} = \\frac{\\tau_{i}}{1 + i\\omega\\tau_{i}}\n$$\nSubstituting this result back into the expression for $G^\\ast(\\omega)$:\n$$\nG^\\ast(\\omega) = G_{\\infty} + \\sum_{i=1}^{N} G_{i} \\frac{i\\omega\\tau_{i}}{1 + i\\omega\\tau_{i}}\n$$\nTo separate the real and imaginary parts, we rationalize the complex fraction:\n$$\n\\frac{i\\omega\\tau_{i}}{1 + i\\omega\\tau_{i}} = \\frac{i\\omega\\tau_{i}(1 - i\\omega\\tau_{i})}{(1 + i\\omega\\tau_{i})(1 - i\\omega\\tau_{i})} = \\frac{i\\omega\\tau_{i} - (i\\omega\\tau_{i})^2}{1 - (i\\omega\\tau_{i})^2} = \\frac{i\\omega\\tau_{i} + \\omega^2\\tau_{i}^2}{1 + \\omega^2\\tau_{i}^2} = \\frac{\\omega^2\\tau_{i}^2}{1 + \\omega^2\\tau_{i}^2} + i \\frac{\\omega\\tau_{i}}{1 + \\omega^2\\tau_{i}^2}\n$$\nThe complex modulus is thus:\n$$\nG^\\ast(\\omega) = G_{\\infty} + \\sum_{i=1}^{N} G_{i} \\left( \\frac{\\omega^2\\tau_{i}^2}{1 + \\omega^2\\tau_{i}^2} + i \\frac{\\omega\\tau_{i}}{1 + \\omega^2\\tau_{i}^2} \\right)\n$$\nBy definition, $G^\\ast(\\omega) = G'(\\omega) + iG''(\\omega)$, where $G'(\\omega)$ is the storage modulus and $G''(\\omega)$ is the loss modulus. Equating the real and imaginary parts yields the desired expressions:\n$$\nG'(\\omega) = G_{\\infty} + \\sum_{i=1}^{N} G_{i} \\frac{\\omega^2\\tau_{i}^2}{1 + \\omega^2\\tau_{i}^2}\n$$\n$$\nG''(\\omega) = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} G_{i} \\frac{\\omega\\tau_{i}}{1 + \\omega^2\\tau_{i}^2}\n$$\nThese expressions clearly demonstrate that for any given frequency $\\omega$ and a prescribed set of relaxation times $\\{\\tau_{i}\\}$, both $G'(\\omega)$ and $G''(\\omega)$ are linear functions of the unknown parameters $\\{G_{i}\\}_{i=1}^{N}$ and $G_{\\infty}$.\n\n### b) Construction of the Linear Least Squares System\n\nWe are tasked with estimating the parameter vector $\\mathbf{x} = [G_{1}, G_{2}, \\dots, G_{N}, G_{\\infty}]^{\\mathsf{T}}$, which has dimensions $(N+1) \\times 1$. The experimental data consists of measurements of storage and loss moduli at a set of $K$ discrete angular frequencies, $\\{\\omega_{k}\\}_{k=1}^{K}$. Let the measured values be $\\{G'_{k, \\text{data}}\\}$ and $\\{G''_{k, \\text{data}}\\}$.\n\nWe construct a single data vector $\\mathbf{y}$ by stacking all $2K$ measurements:\n$$\n\\mathbf{y} = [G'_{1, \\text{data}}, \\dots, G'_{K, \\text{data}}, G''_{1, \\text{data}}, \\dots, G''_{K, \\text{data}}]^{\\mathsf{T}}\n$$\nThis vector has dimensions $2K \\times 1$. The problem is to find $\\mathbf{x}$ that best satisfies the linear system $\\mathbf{A}\\mathbf{x} \\approx \\mathbf{y}$ in a least-squares sense. The system matrix $\\mathbf{A}$, of dimensions $2K \\times (N+1)$, encodes the linear relationships derived in part (a).\n\nThe matrix $\\mathbf{A}$ can be constructed as a vertical concatenation of two blocks, $\\mathbf{A}'$ and $\\mathbf{A}''$, corresponding to the storage and loss modulus equations, respectively:\n$$\n\\mathbf{A} = \\begin{bmatrix} \\mathbf{A}' \\\\ \\mathbf{A}'' \\end{bmatrix}\n$$\nThe block $\\mathbf{A}'$ has dimensions $K \\times (N+1)$. Its elements are the coefficients of the unknowns in the equations for $G'(\\omega_{k})$:\n$$\n(\\mathbf{A}')_{k,j} = \\begin{cases} \\frac{\\omega_{k}^2\\tau_{j}^2}{1 + \\omega_{k}^2\\tau_{j}^2} & \\text{for } j = 1, \\dots, N \\\\ 1 & \\text{for } j = N+1 \\end{cases}\n$$\nThe block $\\mathbf{A}''$ also has dimensions $K \\times (N+1)$. Its elements are the coefficients from the equations for $G''(\\omega_{k})$:\n$$\n(\\mathbf{A}'')_{k,j} = \\begin{cases} \\frac{\\omega_{k}\\tau_{j}}{1 + \\omega_{k}^2\\tau_{j}^2} & \\text{for } j = 1, \\dots, N \\\\ 0 & \\text{for } j = N+1 \\end{cases}\n$$\nThis fully specifies the structure of the overdetermined linear system $\\mathbf{A}\\mathbf{x} \\approx \\mathbf{y}$.\n\n### c) Numerical Implementation Strategy\n\nThe unconstrained linear least-squares problem is to find the vector $\\mathbf{x}$ that minimizes the squared Euclidean norm of the residual, $||\\mathbf{A}\\mathbf{x} - \\mathbf{y}||_2^2$. The standard solution is given by the normal equations:\n$$\n\\mathbf{x} = (\\mathbf{A}^{\\mathsf{T}}\\mathbf{A})^{-1}\\mathbf{A}^{\\mathsf{T}}\\mathbf{y}\n$$\nFor superior numerical stability, direct computation of the inverse $(\\mathbf{A}^{\\mathsf{T}}\\mathbf{A})^{-1}$ is avoided. Instead, methods based on matrix decompositions such as QR or SVD are preferred. The `numpy.linalg.lstsq` function in Python provides a robust implementation for this purpose.\n\nThe implementation will proceed as follows for each test case:\n1.  **Generate Data**: The synthetic data vector $\\mathbf{y}$ is generated using the true model parameters. For Case B, zero-mean Gaussian noise with a specified standard deviation is added to the exact data.\n2.  **Assemble System**: The matrix $\\mathbf{A}$ is constructed based on the estimation relaxation times $\\{\\tau_i\\}$ and the frequency sweep $\\{\\omega_k\\}$. The data vector $\\mathbf{y}$ is stacked.\n3.  **Solve System**: The `numpy.linalg.lstsq` function is called with $\\mathbf{A}$ and $\\mathbf{y}$ to compute the estimated parameter vector $\\mathbf{x}_{\\text{est}}$.\n4.  **Report Results**: The floating-point values in $\\mathbf{x}_{\\text{est}}$ are rounded to the nearest integer to represent the moduli in Pascals, as required. These integer lists are then formatted into the specified final output string.", "answer": "[[100000,200000,150000,50000],[299557,100155],[10,200000,0,100000,0,80000]]", "id": "2681086"}]}
