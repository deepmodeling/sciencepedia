It poses a standard question in continuum mechanics concerning a body under hydrostatic loading. The premises are physically realistic and consistent with the fundamental principles of the field, namely Cauchy's stress principle and the balance of linear momentum. The problem specifies a particular form for the stress tensor, which is a valid simplification for this type of loading, and asks to determine the unknown parameter based on the boundary conditions. The problem is self-contained, providing all necessary information. It is not vague, contradictory, or trivial. The problem is valid.\n\nStep 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. A solution will be provided.\n\nThe first task is to express the boundary traction vector field, denoted $\\boldsymbol{t}$, in terms of the pressure $p$ and the outward unit normal vector $\\boldsymbol{n}$. The traction vector represents the force per unit area acting on a surface. The problem states that a pressure of magnitude $p$ acts *inward* along the *outward* unit normal $\\boldsymbol{n}$. A pressure is a compressive force. By convention in continuum mechanics, the traction vector is defined as positive when it points in the same direction as the outward normal (tension). Since the pressure is compressive and directed inward, it acts in the direction opposite to the outward normal $\\boldsymbol{n}$. Therefore, the traction vector field on the spherical boundary is given by:\n$$\n\\boldsymbol{t} = -p\\,\\boldsymbol{n}\n$$\n\nThe second task is to determine the scalar $q$ in the assumed hydrostatic stress field $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma} = -q\\,\\boldsymbol{I}$ and to verify that this field satisfies the equilibrium conditions.\n\nCauchy's stress principle provides the fundamental relationship between the stress tensor $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}$ at a point and the traction vector $\\boldsymbol{t}$ on an arbitrary surface passing through that point with an outward unit normal $\\boldsymbol{n}$. This relationship is known as Cauchy's formula:\n$$\n\\boldsymbol{t} = \\boldsymbol{\\sigma}\\boldsymbol{n}\n$$\nThis formula must hold at every point on the boundary of the body. We can equate the expression for the traction derived from the physical boundary condition with the expression derived from Cauchy's formula using the assumed form of the stress tensor.\n\nBy substituting $\\boldsymbol{t} = -p\\,\\boldsymbol{n}$ and $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma} = -q\\,\\boldsymbol{I}$ into Cauchy's formula, we obtain:\n$$\n-p\\,\\boldsymbol{n} = (-q\\,\\boldsymbol{I})\\boldsymbol{n}\n$$\nThe action of the second-order identity tensor $\\boldsymbol{I}$ on any vector $\\boldsymbol{n}$ returns the vector itself, i.e., $\\boldsymbol{I}\\boldsymbol{n} = \\boldsymbol{n}$. The equation thus simplifies to:\n$$\n-p\\,\\boldsymbol{n} = -q\\,\\boldsymbol{n}\n$$\nThis can be rewritten as:\n$$\n(q - p)\\boldsymbol{n} = \\boldsymbol{0}\n$$\nwhere $\\boldsymbol{0}$ is the zero vector. Since this relationship must hold for any point on the spherical boundary, it must hold for any non-zero vector $\\boldsymbol{n}$ that is normal to the sphere. This is only possible if the scalar coefficient is zero:\n$$\nq - p = 0 \\implies q = p\n$$\nThus, the boundary condition enforces that the scalar $q$ must be equal to the applied pressure $p$. The resulting Cauchy stress tensor throughout the body is:\n$$\n\\boldsymbol{\\sigma} = -p\\,\\boldsymbol{I}\n$$\n\nFinally, we must verify that this stress field satisfies the condition for static equilibrium throughout the interior of the body. The local form of the balance of linear momentum, also known as the equilibrium equation, states that in the absence of body forces, the divergence of the stress tensor must be zero everywhere in the body:\n$$\n\\nabla \\cdot \\boldsymbol{\\sigma} = \\boldsymbol{0}\n$$\nThe stress tensor we found is $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma} = -p\\,\\boldsymbol{I}$. The problem states that the pressure $p$ is *spatially uniform*, which means $p$ is a constant with respect to the spatial coordinates. Consequently, the stress tensor $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}$ is constant throughout the body. Its components in a Cartesian coordinate system $(x_1, x_2, x_3)$ are $\\sigma_{ij} = -p\\,\\delta_{ij}$, where $\\delta_{ij}$ is the Kronecker delta.\n\nThe $i$-th component of the divergence of the stress tensor is given by $(\\nabla \\cdot \\boldsymbol{\\sigma})_i = \\sum_{j=1}^{3} \\frac{\\partial \\sigma_{ij}}{\\partial x_j}$. Let us compute this:\n$$\n(\\nabla \\cdot \\boldsymbol{\\sigma})_i = \\sum_{j=1}^{3} \\frac{\\partial (-p\\,\\delta_{ij})}{\\partial x_j}\n$$\nSince $p$ is a constant, its partial derivative with respect to any spatial coordinate $x_j$ is zero:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial (-p\\,\\delta_{ij})}{\\partial x_j} = 0\n$$\nTherefore, for each component $i \\in \\{1, 2, 3\\}$:\n$$\n(\\nabla \\cdot \\boldsymbol{\\sigma})_i = \\sum_{j=1}^{3} 0 = 0\n$$\nThis confirms that $\\nabla \\cdot \\boldsymbol{\\sigma} = \\boldsymbol{0}$, and the static equilibrium condition is satisfied throughout the body. The determined stress field is the correct one under the given assumptions. The balance of angular momentum is also satisfied, as a symmetric stress tensor ($\\boldsymbol{\\sigma} = \\boldsymbol{\\sigma}^T$) in the absence of body couples implies zero net torque density. The tensor $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma} = -p\\,\\boldsymbol{I}$ is symmetric, so this condition holds as well.\nThe final expression for the Cauchy stress tensor is $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma} = -p\\,\\boldsymbol{I}$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{-p\\,\\boldsymbol{I}}\n$$", "id": "2621548"}, {"introduction": "Building on the forward problem of calculating traction from a known stress state, this exercise challenges you to solve the inverse problem: reconstructing the entire stress tensor from measured data.

This guarantees that sufficient information is provided to uniquely determine the six independent components of the symmetric stress tensor. The problem is therefore valid.\n\nThe foundation of this problem is Cauchy's stress principle, which postulates that the traction vector $\\boldsymbol{t}$ acting on a surface with unit normal $\\boldsymbol{n}$ at a point $P$ is a function of $P$ and $\\boldsymbol{n}$ only, i.e., $\\boldsymbol{t} = \\boldsymbol{t}(P, \\boldsymbol{n})$.

The cone equation simplifies to:\n$$\nq n_1^2 - p n_2^2 - p n_3^2 = 0 \\quad \\implies \\quad q n_1^2 = p(n_2^2 + n_3^2)\n$$\nThis is the equation of a right circular cone with its axis along $\\boldsymbol{e}_1$. The semi-vertex angle $\\alpha$ is the constant angle between the vector $\\boldsymbol{n}$ and the axis $\\boldsymbol{e}_1$. Thus, we can write $n_1 = \\cos\\alpha$ and $n_2^2 + n_3^2 = \\sin^2\\alpha$. Substituting these into the simplified cone equation gives:\n$$\nq \\cos^2\\alpha = p \\sin^2\\alpha\n$$\nRearranging the terms, we get an expression for $\\tan^2\\alpha$:\n$$\n\\tan^2\\alpha = \\frac{\\sin^2\\alpha}{\\cos^2\\alpha} = \\frac{q}{p}\n$$\nAs the semi-vertex angle is acute, $\\alpha \\in [0, \\pi/2]$, so $\\tan\\alpha$ is non-negative. Taking the square root gives $\\tan\\alpha = \\sqrt{q/p}$. The closed-form expression for $\\alpha$ is therefore:\n$$\n\\alpha = \\arctan\\left(\\sqrt{\\frac{q}{p}}\\right)\n$$\n\n4) Finally, we evaluate $\\alpha$ for the given values: $\\sigma_1 = q = 150\\,\\mathrm{MPa}$ and $\\sigma_2 = \\sigma_3 = -p = -100\\,\\mathrm{MPa}$. This implies $p = 100\\,\\mathrm{MPa}$. The ratio $q/p$ is:\n$$\n\\frac{q}{p} = \\frac{150}{100} = 1.5\n$$\nThe angle $\\alpha$ in radians is:\n$$\n\\alpha = \\arctan\\left(\\sqrt{1.5}\\right)\n$$\nNumerically, $\\sqrt{1.5} \\approx 1.22474487$. Therefore:\n$$\n\\alpha \\approx \\arctan(1.22474487) \\approx 0.88607703\\,\\mathrm{rad}\n$$\nRounding the result to four significant figures, we obtain $\\alpha \\approx 0.8861\\,\\mathrm{rad}$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{0.8861}\n$$", "id": "2621551"}]}
