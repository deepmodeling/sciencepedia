This relationship is mediated by the Cauchy stress tensor $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}$. We will derive this relationship and then apply it to the specific case given.\n\nFirst, we define the components of the Cauchy stress tensor. Let $\\{\\mathbf{e}_r, \\mathbf{e}_\\theta, \\mathbf{e}_z\\}$ be the orthonormal basis at a point in the cylindrical coordinate system. The component $\\sigma_{ij}$ of the stress tensor $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}$ is defined as the $i$-th component of the traction vector acting on a surface element whose outward normal is in the $\\mathbf{e}_j$ direction. With this convention, the traction vector $\\mathbf{t}^{(\\mathbf{e}_j)}$ on the $j$-th coordinate plane is given by:\n$$ \\mathbf{t}^{(\\mathbf{e}_j)} = \\sum_{i} \\sigma_{ij} \\mathbf{e}_i $$\nThe traction vector $\\mathbf{t}$ on a surface with an arbitrary unit normal $\\mathbf{n}$ is then given by the relation $\\mathbf{t} = \\boldsymbol{\\sigma}\\mathbf{n}$, which in component form is:\n$$ t_i = \\sum_{j} \\sigma_{ij} n_j $$\nWe are required to derive this result.\n\nConsider an infinitesimal wedge-shaped volume (a tetrahedron) at a point $P$ in the continuum. Three faces of the tetrahedron are mutually orthogonal, aligned with the local coordinate planes with normals $-\\mathbf{e}_r, -\\mathbf{e}_\\theta, -\\mathbf{e}_z$. Let their areas be $dA_r, dA_\\theta, dA_z$, respectively. The fourth face is the hypotenuse, with area $dA$ and outward unit normal $\\mathbf{n}$. The geometric relations between the areas are $dA_r = (\\mathbf{n} \\cdot \\mathbf{e}_r) dA = n_r dA$, $dA_\\theta = (\\mathbf{n} \\cdot \\mathbf{e}_\\theta) dA = n_\\theta dA$, and $dA_z = (\\mathbf{n} \\cdot \\mathbf{e}_z) dA = n_z dA$.\n\nThe balance of linear momentum for this infinitesimal volume $V$ is given by:\n$$ \\int_{\\partial V} \\mathbf{t} \\, dS + \\int_V \\mathbf{b} \\, dV = \\int_V \\rho \\mathbf{a} \\, dV $$\nwhere $\\mathbf{b}$ is the body force per unit volume, $\\rho$ is the mass density, and $\\mathbf{a}$ is the acceleration.

Substituting this and the area relations into the momentum equation:\n$$ \\mathbf{t}^{(\\mathbf{n})} dA - \\mathbf{t}^{(\\mathbf{e}_r)} n_r dA - \\mathbf{t}^{(\\mathbf{e}_\\theta)} n_\\theta dA - \\mathbf{t}^{(\\mathbf{e}_z)} n_z dA + (\\mathbf{b} - \\rho \\mathbf{a}) dV = \\mathbf{0} $$\nWe divide by $dA$ and take the limit as the volume of the element shrinks to the point $P$. The volume $V$ is of the order of $h^3$, where $h$ is a characteristic length of the tetrahedron, while the area $dA$ is of the order of $h^2$. Therefore, the term containing $dV/dA$ vanishes as $h \\to 0$:\n$$ \\lim_{h \\to 0} \\frac{dV}{dA} = 0 $$\nThe balance equation thus reduces to a relation between the surface tractions:\n$$ \\mathbf{t}^{(\\mathbf{n})} = n_r \\mathbf{t}^{(\\mathbf{e}_r)} + n_\\theta \\mathbf{t}^{(\\mathbf{e}_\\theta)} + n_z \\mathbf{t}^{(\\mathbf{e}_z)} = \\sum_{j} n_j \\mathbf{t}^{(\\mathbf{e}_j)} $$\nNow, we substitute the definition of the stress tensor components, $\\mathbf{t}^{(\\mathbf{e}_j)} = \\sum_{i} \\sigma_{ij} \\mathbf{e}_i$:\n$$ \\mathbf{t}^{(\\mathbf{n})} = \\sum_{j} n_j \\left( \\sum_{i} \\sigma_{ij} \\mathbf{e}_i \\right) = \\sum_{i} \\left( \\sum_{j} \\sigma_{ij} n_j \\right) \\mathbf{e}_i $$\nThe $i$-th component of the traction vector $\\mathbf{t}^{(\\mathbf{n})}$, denoted $t_i$, is therefore:\n$$ t_i = \\sum_{j} \\sigma_{ij} n_j $$\nThis is the component form of Cauchy's stress formula, $\\mathbf{t} = \\boldsymbol{\\sigma}\\mathbf{n}$.\n\nWe now apply this general result to the specific problem. The surface is defined by $r=R$, and the exterior unit normal is $\\mathbf{n} = \\mathbf{e}_r$. In the basis $\\{\\mathbf{e}_r, \\mathbf{e}_\\theta, \\mathbf{e}_z\\}$, the components of this normal vector are $n_r = 1$, $n_\\theta = 0$, and $n_z = 0$.\nThe components of the traction vector $(t_r, t_\\theta, t_z)$ are found by expanding the summation for $i=r, \\theta, z$ and $j=r, \\theta, z$:\n$$ t_r = \\sigma_{rr} n_r + \\sigma_{r\\theta} n_\\theta + \\sigma_{rz} n_z = \\sigma_{rr}(1) + \\sigma_{r\\theta}(0) + \\sigma_{rz}(0) = \\sigma_{rr} $$\n$$ t_\\theta = \\sigma_{\\theta r} n_r + \\sigma_{\\theta\\theta} n_\\theta + \\sigma_{\\theta z} n_z = \\sigma_{\\theta r}(1) + \\sigma_{\\theta\\theta}(0) + \\sigma_{\\theta z}(0) = \\sigma_{\\theta r} $$\n$$ t_z = \\sigma_{zr} n_r + \\sigma_{z\\theta} n_\\theta + \\sigma_{zz} n_z = \\sigma_{zr}(1) + \\sigma_{z\\theta}(0) + \\sigma_{zz}(0) = \\sigma_{zr} $$\nThe traction vector components are thus $(t_r, t_\\theta, t_z) = (\\sigma_{rr}, \\sigma_{\\theta r}, \\sigma_{zr})$.\n\nThe problem requires the result to be expressed in terms of $\\sigma_{rr}$, $\\sigma_{r\\theta}$, and $\\sigma_{rz}$ only. To achieve this, we must invoke the symmetry of the Cauchy stress tensor.\nThe symmetry of the stress tensor, $\\sigma_{ij} = \\sigma_{ji}$, is a consequence of the balance of angular momentum, provided there are no distributed body couples. For an infinitesimal volume element, the net torque must vanish in the limit as the element's size approaches zero. The torques produced by body forces and inertial effects are of a higher differential order than the torques produced by surface tractions (shear stresses). Consequently, in the limit, the sum of torques from surface tractions must be zero. This leads to the condition that the shear stresses on orthogonal planes must be equal, i.e., $\\sigma_{ij} = \\sigma_{ji}$ for $i \\neq j$.\nSpecifically for our cylindrical coordinate system, this implies:\n$$ \\sigma_{\\theta r} = \\sigma_{r\\theta} $$\n$$ \\sigma_{zr} = \\sigma_{rz} $$\n$$ \\sigma_{z\\theta} = \\sigma_{\\theta z} $$\nBy invoking this fundamental property, we can express the components of the traction vector in the required form:\n$$ t_r = \\sigma_{rr} $$\n$$ t_\\theta = \\sigma_{\\theta r} = \\sigma_{r\\theta} $$\n$$ t_z = \\sigma_{zr} = \\sigma_{rz} $$\nTherefore, the ordered triple of traction components $(t_r, t_\\theta, t_z)$ acting on the exterior face of the surface $r=R$ is $(\\sigma_{rr}, \\sigma_{r\\theta}, \\sigma_{rz})$. This result is physically intuitive: the traction on a surface with normal $\\mathbf{e}_r$ is given by the three stress components corresponding to forces on the $r$-plane.", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{ \\begin{pmatrix} \\sigma_{rr} & \\sigma_{r\\theta} & \\sigma_{rz} \\end{pmatrix} } $$", "id": "2619643"}, {"introduction": "For any state of stress, there exist special orientations, known as principal planes, where the material experiences no shear.

The corresponding scalar $\\lambda$ is the eigenvalue, which represents the magnitude of the purely normal stress acting on that plane.
