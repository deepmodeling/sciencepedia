This results in an equivalent stress of $\\sigma_{\\mathrm{eq}}^{(B)} = 75$ MPa. This state will cause the material to yield if its yield strength, $\\sigma_Y$, is less than or equal to $75$ MPa.\nThe analysis demonstrates a core principle of plasticity theory: two stress states with identical hydrostatic pressures can have vastly different effects on yielding. The propensity to induce plastic flow is governed by the deviatoric stress, quantified by measures like $J_{2}$ or $\\sigma_{\\mathrm{eq}}$.\n\nThe final required quantity is the von Mises equivalent stress for state B.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{75}\n$$", "id": "2630214"}, {"introduction": "Bridging theory and practice, this final exercise [@problem_id:2630197] challenges you to formalize the stress decomposition computationally.

The derivation must be constructed from first principles.\n\nWe are given the following as axiomatic truths:\n1. The Cauchy stress tensor $\\sigma$ is symmetric, i.e., $\\sigma = \\sigma^T$.\n2. The decomposition is additive: $\\sigma = \\sigma_{\\text{sph}} + s$.\n3. The spherical part, $\\sigma_{\\text{sph}}$, represents a state of pure volumetric change and is thus isotropic. In three-dimensional space, the only second-order isotropic tensors are scalar multiples of the identity tensor, $I$. Therefore, $\\sigma_{\\text{sph}} = pI$ for some scalar $p$, which we identify as the mean stress.\n4. The deviatoric part, $s$, represents a state of pure shear (isochoric change), or shape change without volume change. This physical property is captured by the mathematical condition that its trace must be zero: $\\operatorname{tr}(s) = 0$.\n5. The decomposition must be defined by linear mappings, which we will derive and prove to be projectors.\n\nFrom these foundational points, we proceed with the derivation.\n\nFirst, we determine the scalar $p$.

To confirm they are projectors, we must show they are idempotent, i.e., $P^2 = P$.\n\nFor $P_{\\text{sph}}$: Let $\\sigma' = P_{\\text{sph}}(\\sigma) = (\\frac{1}{3}\\operatorname{tr}(\\sigma))I$.\n$$ P_{\\text{sph}}(P_{\\text{sph}}(\\sigma)) = P_{\\text{sph}}(\\sigma') = \\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\operatorname{tr}(\\sigma')\\right) I = \\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\operatorname{tr}\\left(\\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\operatorname{tr}(\\sigma)\\right) I\\right)\\right) I $$\n$$ = \\left(\\frac{1}{3} \\cdot \\frac{1}{3}\\operatorname{tr}(\\sigma) \\cdot \\operatorname{tr}(I)\\right) I = \\left(\\frac{1}{9}\\operatorname{tr}(\\sigma) \\cdot 3\\right) I = \\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\operatorname{tr}(\\sigma)\\right) I = P_{\\text{sph}}(\\sigma) $$\nThus, $P_{\\text{sph}}^2 = P_{\\text{sph}}$.\n\nFor $P_{\\text{dev}}$: Let $s = P_{\\text{dev}}(\\sigma)$.\n$$ P_{\\text{dev}}(P_{\\text{dev}}(\\sigma)) = P_{\\text{dev}}(s) = s - \\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\operatorname{tr}(s)\\right) I $$\nSince $\\operatorname{tr}(s) = 0$ by definition of the deviatoric part, this simplifies to:\n$$ P_{\\text{dev}}(s) = s - 0 = s = P_{\\text{dev}}(\\sigma) $$\nThus, $P_{\\text{dev}}^2 = P_{\\text{dev}}$. Both mappings are indeed projectors.\n\nFurthermore, these projectors are orthogonal and form a complete set.\nOrthogonality of the projected components is verified by their double-dot product, $A:B = \\sum_{i,j} A_{ij}B_{ij}$:\n$$ \\sigma_{\\text{sph}} : s = (pI) : (\\sigma - pI) = p(I:\\sigma) - p^2(I:I) $$\nThe double-dot products are $I:\\sigma = \\delta_{ij}\\sigma_{ij} = \\sigma_{ii} = \\operatorname{tr}(\\sigma)$ and $I:I = \\delta_{ij}\\delta_{ij} = \\delta_{ii} = 3$.\nSubstituting these and $p = \\frac{1}{3}\\operatorname{tr}(\\sigma)$:\n$$ \\sigma_{\\text{sph}} : s = \\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\operatorname{tr}(\\sigma)\\right)\\operatorname{tr}(\\sigma) - \\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\operatorname{tr}(\\sigma)\\right)^2 (3) = \\frac{1}{3}(\\operatorname{tr}(\\sigma))^2 - \\frac{1}{9}(\\operatorname{tr}(\\sigma))^2 (3) = \\frac{1}{3}(\\operatorname{tr}(\\sigma))^2 - \\frac{1}{3}(\\operatorname{tr}(\\sigma))^2 = 0 $$\nThe spherical and deviatoric components are orthogonal.\n\nThe projectors are mutually annihilating:\n$$ P_{\\text{sph}}(P_{\\text{dev}}(\\sigma)) = P_{\\text{sph}}(s) = \\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\operatorname{tr}(s)\\right) I = \\left(\\frac{1}{3} \\cdot 0\\right) I = 0 $$\n$$ P_{\\text{dev}}(P_{\\text{sph}}(\\sigma)) = P_{\\text{dev}}(pI) = pI - \\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\operatorname{tr}(pI)\\right)I = pI - \\left(\\frac{1}{3} \\cdot 3p\\right)I = pI - pI = 0 $$\nFinally, the sum of the projectors is the identity mapping, $\\mathcal{I}$:\n$$ (P_{\\text{sph}} + P_{\\text{dev}})(\\sigma) = P_{\\text{sph}}(\\sigma) + P_{\\text{dev}}(\\sigma) = \\sigma_{\\text{sph}} + s = \\sigma = \\mathcal{I}(\\sigma) $$\nThis completes the derivation. The implementation will proceed based on these derived formulas for $P_{\\text{sph}}$ and $P_{\\text{dev}}$ and verify the specified conditions using a numerical tolerance of $\\epsilon=10^{-12}$. The Frobenius norm, $\\|A\\|_F$, is computed as $\\sqrt{A:A}$.\n\nThe implementation will test the following five conditions:\n1.  For hydrostatic loading $\\sigma^{(1)}$, we test if $\\| P_{\\text{sph}}(\\sigma^{(1)}) - \\sigma^{(1)} \\|_F < \\epsilon$ and $\\| P_{\\text{dev}}(\\sigma^{(1)}) \\|_F < \\epsilon$.\n2.  For simple shear $\\sigma^{(2)}$, we test if $\\| P_{\\text{sph}}(\\sigma^{(2)}) \\|_F < \\epsilon$ and $\\| P_{\\text{dev}}(\\sigma^{(2)}) - \\sigma^{(2)} \\|_F < \\epsilon$.\n3.  For a mixed state $\\sigma^{(3)}$, we test if $|\\operatorname{tr}(P_{\\text{dev}}(\\sigma^{(3)}))| < \\epsilon$, $\\| P_{\\text{sph}}(\\sigma^{(3)}) + P_{\\text{dev}}(\\sigma^{(3)}) - \\sigma^{(3)} \\|_F < \\epsilon$, and $|P_{\\text{sph}}(\\sigma^{(3)}) : P_{\\text{dev}}(\\sigma^{(3)})| < \\epsilon$.\n4.  For the zero state $\\sigma^{(4)}$, we test if $\\| P_{\\text{sph}}(\\sigma^{(4)}) \\|_F < \\epsilon$ and $\\| P_{\\text{dev}}(\\sigma^{(4)}) \\|_F < \\epsilon$.\n5.  For a general symmetric state $\\sigma^{(5)}$, we test the projector algebra: idempotence $\\| P_{\\text{sph}}(P_{\\text{sph}}(\\sigma^{(5)})) - P_{\\text{sph}}(\\sigma^{(5)}) \\|_F < \\epsilon$ and $\\| P_{\\text{dev}}(P_{\\text{dev}}(\\sigma^{(5)})) - P_{\\text{dev}}(\\sigma^{(5)}) \\|_F < \\epsilon$; mutual annihilation $\\| P_{\\text{sph}}(P_{\\text{dev}}(\\sigma^{(5)})) \\|_F < \\epsilon$ and $\\| P_{\\text{dev}}(P_{\\text{sph}}(\\sigma^{(5)})) \\|_F < \\epsilon$; orthogonality $|P_{\\text{sph}}(\\sigma^{(5)}) : P_{\\text{dev}}(\\sigma^{(5)})| < \\epsilon$; and completeness $\\| P_{\\text{sph}}(\\sigma^{(5)}) + P_{\\text{dev}}(\\sigma^{(5)}) - \\sigma^{(5)} \\|_F < \\epsilon$.", "answer": "```python\n# The complete and runnable Python 3 code goes here.\n# Imports must adhere to the specified execution environment.\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Derives, implements, and verifies the decomposition of a Cauchy stress tensor\n    into its spherical and deviatoric parts.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Define numerical tolerance and 3x3 identity tensor.\n    TOL = 1e-12\n    I = np.identity(3)\n\n    # --- Test Suite Specification ---\n    s = 12.3\n    tau = 7.5\n\n    # sigma_1: Hydrostatic tension\n    sigma_1 = s * I\n\n    # sigma_2: Simple shear in the x-y plane\n    sigma_2 = np.array([\n        [0.0, tau, 0.0],\n        [tau, 0.0, 0.0],\n        [0.0, 0.0, 0.0]\n    ])\n\n    # sigma_3: Mixed state\n    sigma_3 = np.array([\n        [ 5.0, -1.2, 0.0],\n        [-1.2, -2.0, 3.0],\n        [ 0.0,  3.0, 1.0]\n    ])\n\n    # sigma_4: Zero state\n    sigma_4 = np.zeros((3, 3))\n\n    # sigma_5: General symmetric state for projector algebra checks\n    sigma_5 = np.array([\n        [ 2.2, -0.3, 4.1],\n        [-0.3, -5.7, 0.0],\n        [ 4.1,  0.0, 1.3]\n    ])\n\n    test_tensors = [sigma_1, sigma_2, sigma_3, sigma_4, sigma_5]\n\n    # --- Helper functions for tensor operations ---\n    def tensor_trace(T):\n        return np.trace(T)\n\n    def double_dot(A, B):\n        return np.sum(A * B)\n\n    def frobenius_norm(T):\n        return np.linalg.norm(T)\n\n    # --- Projector Implementations based on Derivation ---\n    def P_sph(sigma):\n        \"\"\"Projects a tensor to its spherical part.\"\"\"\n        p = (1/3) * tensor_trace(sigma)\n        return p * I\n\n    def P_dev(sigma):\n        \"\"\"Projects a tensor to its deviatoric part.\"\"\"\n        return sigma - P_sph(sigma)\n\n    results = []\n\n    # --- Verification Tests ---\n\n    # Test 1: Hydrostatic loading correctness\n    s1_sph = P_sph(sigma_1)\n    s1_dev = P_dev(sigma_1)\n    test1_cond1 = frobenius_norm(s1_sph - sigma_1) < TOL\n    test1_cond2 = frobenius_norm(s1_dev) < TOL\n    results.append(test1_cond1 and test1_cond2)\n\n    # Test 2: Simple shear correctness\n    s2_sph = P_sph(sigma_2)\n    s2_dev = P_dev(sigma_2)\n    test2_cond1 = frobenius_norm(s2_sph) < TOL\n    test2_cond2 = frobenius_norm(s2_dev - sigma_2) < TOL\n    results.append(test2_cond1 and test2_cond2)\n\n    # Test 3: Mixed state decomposition properties\n    s3_sph = P_sph(sigma_3)\n    s3_dev = P_dev(sigma_3)\n    test3_cond1 = abs(tensor_trace(s3_dev)) < TOL\n    test3_cond2 = frobenius_norm(s3_sph + s3_dev - sigma_3) < TOL\n    test3_cond3 = abs(double_dot(s3_sph, s3_dev)) < TOL\n    results.append(test3_cond1 and test3_cond2 and test3_cond3)\n\n    # Test 4: Zero state sanity\n    s4_sph = P_sph(sigma_4)\n    s4_dev = P_dev(sigma_4)\n    test4_cond1 = frobenius_norm(s4_sph) < TOL\n    test4_cond2 = frobenius_norm(s4_dev) < TOL\n    results.append(test4_cond1 and test4_cond2)\n    \n    # Test 5: Projector algebra on a general state\n    s5_sph = P_sph(sigma_5)\n    s5_dev = P_dev(sigma_5)\n    \n    # Idempotence: P(P(s)) = P(s)\n    idemp_sph = frobenius_norm(P_sph(s5_sph) - s5_sph) < TOL\n    idemp_dev = frobenius_norm(P_dev(s5_dev) - s5_dev) < TOL\n    \n    # Mutual annihilation: P_sph(P_dev(s)) = 0 and P_dev(P_sph(s)) = 0\n    annih_sph_dev = frobenius_norm(P_sph(s5_dev)) < TOL\n    annih_dev_sph = frobenius_norm(P_dev(s5_sph)) < TOL\n    \n    # Orthogonality: P_sph(s) : P_dev(s) = 0\n    ortho = abs(double_dot(s5_sph, s5_dev)) < TOL\n    \n    # Completeness: P_sph(s) + P_dev(s) = s\n    complete = frobenius_norm(s5_sph + s5_dev - sigma_5) < TOL\n    \n    results.append(idemp_sph and idemp_dev and annih_sph_dev and annih_dev_sph and ortho and complete)\n\n    # Final print statement in the exact required format.\n    print(f\"[{','.join(map(str, results))}]\")\n\nsolve()\n```", "id": "2630197"}]}
