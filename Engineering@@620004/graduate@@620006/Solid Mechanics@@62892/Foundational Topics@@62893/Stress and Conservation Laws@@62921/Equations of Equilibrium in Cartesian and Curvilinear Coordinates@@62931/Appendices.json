The problem concerns a long cylinder far from the ends, which, by Saint-Venant's principle, implies the stress state is also independent of the axial coordinate $z$, so $\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z} (\\cdot) = 0$.\n\nApplying these conditions to the equilibrium equations:\nThe $\\theta$-equation simplifies to $\\frac{\\partial \\sigma_{r\\theta}}{\\partial r} + \\frac{2\\sigma_{r\\theta}}{r} = 0$. This can be rewritten as $\\frac{1}{r^2} \\frac{d}{dr}(r^2 \\sigma_{r\\theta}) = 0$. Integrating gives $r^2 \\sigma_{r\\theta} = C_1$, where $C_1$ is a constant. Since the tractions on the inner and outer surfaces are purely normal pressures, the shear stress $\\sigma_{r\\theta}$ must be zero at $r=r_i$ and $r=r_o$. This requires $C_1 = 0$, so $\\sigma_{r\\theta} = 0$ everywhere. Similarly, axisymmetry would imply $\\sigma_{\\theta z}=0$.\n\nThe $z$-equation simplifies to $\\frac{d \\sigma_{rz}}{dr} + \\frac{\\sigma_{rz}}{r} = 0$. This can be rewritten as $\\frac{1}{r}\\frac{d}{dr}(r \\sigma_{rz}) = 0$. Integrating gives $r \\sigma_{rz} = C_2$. The boundary conditions are that the surfaces $r=r_i$ and $r=r_o$ are subjected to pressure loading only, meaning there are no shear tractions. Thus, $\\sigma_{rz}(r_i) = 0$ and $\\sigma_{rz}(r_o) = 0$. Either condition suffices to show that $C_2 = 0$, and therefore $\\sigma_{rz} = 0$ everywhere. This addresses the suppression of the $\\sigma_{rz}$ component.\n\nThe only remaining nontrivial equilibrium equation is the $r$-component, which becomes the governing differential equation for radial balance:\n$$ \\frac{d \\sigma_{rr}}{dr} + \\frac{\\sigma_{rr} - \\sigma_{\\theta\\theta}}{r} = 0 $$\n\n2) Solution for radial and hoop stresses.\nThe radial equilibrium equation is a single equation with two unknown functions, $\\sigma_{rr}(r)$ and $\\sigma_{\\theta\\theta}(r)$. The problem is statically indeterminate. To solve it, we must introduce further relations from elasticity theory. The strain-displacement relations for the axisymmetric case are $\\epsilon_{rr} = \\frac{du_r}{dr}$ and $\\epsilon_{\\theta\\theta} = \\frac{u_r}{r}$, where $u_r$ is the radial displacement. These lead to a compatibility equation: $\\frac{d}{dr}(r\\epsilon_{\\theta\\theta}) = \\epsilon_{rr}$.\nFor a general plane problem with no body forces, the compatibility of strains requires that $\\nabla^2(\\sigma_{rr} + \\sigma_{\\theta\\theta}) = 0$. For the present axisymmetric case, this simplifies to $\\frac{1}{r}\\frac{d}{dr}\\left(r\\frac{d}{dr}(\\sigma_{rr} + \\sigma_{\\theta\\theta})\\right) = 0$. Integrating twice gives $\\sigma_{rr} + \\sigma_{\\theta\\theta} = C_1\\ln(r) + 2A$. For the displacement field to be single-valued in a hollow cylinder, the logarithmic term must be absent, so $C_1=0$. Thus, $\\sigma_{rr} + \\sigma_{\\theta\\theta} = 2A$, where $A$ is a constant.\n\nWe now have a system of two equations:\n(i) $\\sigma_{\\theta\\theta} - \\sigma_{rr} = r \\frac{d\\sigma_{rr}}{dr}$ (from equilibrium)\n(ii) $\\sigma_{\\theta\\theta} + \\sigma_{rr} = 2A$ (from compatibility)\nAdding (i) and (ii): $2\\sigma_{\\theta\\theta} = 2A + r \\frac{d\\sigma_{rr}}{dr}$.\nSubtracting (i) from (ii): $2\\sigma_{rr} = 2A - r \\frac{d\\sigma_{rr}}{dr}$, which gives $r\\frac{d\\sigma_{rr}}{dr} + 2\\sigma_{rr} = 2A$. This is a first-order linear ordinary differential equation for $\\sigma_{rr}$. Multiplying by an integrating factor of $r$ gives $r^2\\frac{d\\sigma_{rr}}{dr} + 2r\\sigma_{rr} = 2Ar$, which is $\\frac{d}{dr}(r^2\\sigma_{rr}) = 2Ar$. Integrating with respect to $r$ yields $r^2\\sigma_{rr} = Ar^2 - B$, where $-B$ is the constant of integration.\nThe general solution for the radial stress is thus:\n$$ \\sigma_{rr}(r) = A - \\frac{B}{r^2} $$\nSubstituting this into $\\sigma_{\\theta\\theta} = 2A - \\sigma_{rr}$ gives the hoop stress:\n$$ \\sigma_{\\theta\\theta}(r) = A + \\frac{B}{r^2} $$\nThese are the well-known Lamé equations. The constants $A$ and $B$ are determined from the boundary conditions on tractions. The pressure $p$ corresponds to a compressive normal stress, so $\\sigma_{rr} = -p$.\nAt $r=r_i$, $\\sigma_{rr}(r_i) = -p_i \\implies A - \\frac{B}{r_i^2} = -p_i$.\nAt $r=r_o$, $\\sigma_{rr}(r_o) = -p_o \\implies A - \\frac{B}{r_o^2} = -p_o$.\nThis is a linear system for $A$ and $B$. Subtracting the second equation from the first yields $B\\left(\\frac{1}{r_o^2} - \\frac{1}{r_i^2}\\right) = p_o - p_i$, which gives $B = \\frac{(p_i - p_o)r_i^2 r_o^2}{r_o^2 - r_i^2}$.\nSubstituting $B$ back into the second equation gives $A = -p_o + \\frac{B}{r_o^2} = -p_o + \\frac{(p_i - p_o)r_i^2}{r_o^2 - r_i^2} = \\frac{-p_o(r_o^2-r_i^2) + p_i r_i^2 - p_o r_i^2}{r_o^2 - r_i^2}$, which simplifies to $A = \\frac{p_i r_i^2 - p_o r_o^2}{r_o^2 - r_i^2}$.\n\n3) Determination of axial stress $\\sigma_{zz}$ from global equilibrium.\nFor this part, we must use only equilibrium principles as instructed. We consider a free-body diagram of a portion of the cylinder, including one of the closed ends, cut by a plane at $z=\\text{constant}$ far from the ends. Let the $z$-axis be the axis of the cylinder. The net force in the $z$-direction on this free body must be zero.\nThe forces acting in the $z$-direction are:\ni) The force exerted by the internal pressure $p_i$ on the inner face of the end cap. This force is $F_{p_i} = p_i \\cdot (\\pi r_i^2)$.\nii) The force exerted by the external pressure $p_o$ on the outer face of the end cap. This force is $F_{p_o} = -p_o \\cdot (\\pi r_o^2)$.\niii) The force resulting from the axial stress $\\sigma_{zz}$ acting on the annular cross-section of the pipe at the cut. As we are far from the ends, $\\sigma_{zz}$ is uniform over the cross-section. The area of the cross-section is $\\pi(r_o^2 - r_i^2)$. This force is $F_{\\sigma_z} = -\\sigma_{zz} \\cdot \\pi(r_o^2 - r_i^2)$, where the negative sign indicates it opposes the pressure forces for a tensile $\\sigma_{zz}$.\n\nThe condition for static equilibrium in the $z$-direction is $\\sum F_z = 0$:\n$$ F_{p_i} + F_{p_o} + F_{\\sigma_z} = 0 $$\n$$ p_i \\pi r_i^2 - p_o \\pi r_o^2 - \\sigma_{zz} \\pi(r_o^2 - r_i^2) = 0 $$\nWe can cancel the common factor of $\\pi$ and solve for $\\sigma_{zz}$:\n$$ \\sigma_{zz} (r_o^2 - r_i^2) = p_i r_i^2 - p_o r_o^2 $$\nThis gives the uniform axial stress:\n$$ \\sigma_{zz} = \\frac{p_i r_i^2 - p_o r_o^2}{r_o^2 - r_i^2} $$\nIt is noteworthy that this expression for $\\sigma_{zz}$ is identical to the constant $A$ derived in Part 2.

Therefore, the stress field derived from the given $\\Phi$ is statically admissible.\n\nPart 2: Strain Compatibility\nThe 2D Saint-Venant compatibility condition on the strain tensor components is:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial^2 \\epsilon_{xx}}{\\partial y^2} + \\frac{\\partial^2 \\epsilon_{yy}}{\\partial x^2} = 2 \\frac{\\partial^2 \\epsilon_{xy}}{\\partial x \\partial y}\n$$\nFor a homogeneous, isotropic, linearly elastic material under plane strain, the strain-stress relations (Hooke's law) are:\n$$\n\\epsilon_{xx} = \\frac{1}{E} [(1-\\nu^2)\\sigma_{xx} - \\nu(1+\\nu)\\sigma_{yy}] \\\\\n\\epsilon_{yy} = \\frac{1}{E} [(1-\\nu^2)\\sigma_{yy} - \\nu(1+\\nu)\\sigma_{xx}] \\\\\n\\epsilon_{xy} = \\frac{1+\\nu}{E} \\sigma_{xy}\n$$\nwhere $E$ is Young's modulus and $\\nu$ is Poisson's ratio. The sum of the normal stresses is $\\sigma_{xx} + \\sigma_{yy} = \\nabla^2 \\Phi$. The sum of the normal strains (dilatation $\\theta$) is $\\theta = \\epsilon_{xx} + \\epsilon_{yy} = \\frac{1-2\\nu}{E}(1+\\nu)(\\sigma_{xx}+\\sigma_{yy}) = \\frac{(1+\\nu)(1-2\\nu)}{E}\\nabla^2\\Phi$.\nIn the absence of body forces, the compatibility equations for stresses, known as the Beltrami-Michell equations, reduce to $\\nabla^2 (\\sigma_{xx}+\\sigma_{yy})=0$ for plane stress. For plane strain, the compatibility requires that the dilatation be a harmonic function, $\\nabla^2 \\theta = 0$. Substituting the expression for $\\theta$:\n$$\n\\nabla^2 \\left(\\frac{(1+\\nu)(1-2\\nu)}{E}\\nabla^2\\Phi\\right) = 0\n$$\nFor a homogeneous material, $E$ and $\\nu$ are constants. Thus, we have:\n$$\n\\frac{(1+\\nu)(1-2\\nu)}{E} \\nabla^4 \\Phi = 0\n$$\nwhere $\\nabla^4 = \\nabla^2 \\nabla^2 = \\frac{\\partial^4}{\\partial x^4} + 2\\frac{\\partial^4}{\\partial x^2 \\partial y^2} + \\frac{\\partial^4}{\\partial y^4}$ is the biharmonic operator. This is of the form $c \\, \\nabla^4 \\Phi = 0$ with $c = \\frac{(1+\\nu)(1-2\\nu)}{E}$. For a physically meaningful elastic material, $E>0$ and $-1 < \\nu < 0.5$, which ensures $c \\neq 0$. Therefore, strain compatibility requires that the Airy stress function must satisfy the biharmonic equation:\n$$\n\\nabla^4 \\Phi = 0\n$$\nA stress field satisfying this condition is called kinematically admissible. To show that the given $\\Phi$ does not satisfy strain compatibility, we must show that $\\nabla^4 \\Phi$ is not identically zero in $\\Omega$. We compute its value at the origin. If this value is non-zero, compatibility is violated.\n\nPart 3: Computation of $S = (\\nabla^4 \\Phi)(0,0)$\nWe need to compute $S = \\left(\\frac{\\partial^4}{\\partial x^4} + 2\\frac{\\partial^4}{\\partial x^2 \\partial y^2} + \\frac{\\partial^4}{\\partial y^4}\\right) \\Phi(x,y)$ evaluated at $(x,y)=(0,0)$.\nLet $\\Phi(x,y) = f(x)g(y)$, where $f(x) = (1-x^2)^3$ and $g(y) = (1-y^2)^3$. Then:\n$$\n\\nabla^4 \\Phi = \\frac{d^4 f}{dx^4} g(y) + 2 \\frac{d^2 f}{dx^2} \\frac{d^2 g}{dy^2} + f(x) \\frac{d^4 g}{dy^4}\n$$\nEvaluating at $(0,0)$:\n$$\nS = f^{(4)}(0)g(0) + 2 f''(0)g''(0) + f(0)g^{(4)}(0)\n$$\nWe can find the derivatives at $x=0$ by expanding $f(x)$ as a Maclaurin series:\n$f(x) = (1-x^2)^3 = \\binom{3}{0}1^3 - \\binom{3}{1}1^2(x^2)^1 + \\binom{3}{2}1^1(x^2)^2 - \\binom{3}{3}(x^2)^3 = 1 - 3x^2 + 3x^4 - x^6$.\nThe Maclaurin series is $f(x) = f(0) + f'(0)x + \\frac{f''(0)}{2!}x^2 + \\frac{f'''(0)}{3!}x^3 + \\frac{f^{(4)}(0)}{4!}x^4 + \\dots$.\nBy comparing the coefficients of the polynomial with the series terms:\n- Coefficient of $x^0$: $f(0) = 1$.\n- Coefficient of $x^2$: $\\frac{f''(0)}{2!} = -3 \\implies f''(0) = -3 \\times 2 = -6$.\n- Coefficient of $x^4$: $\\frac{f^{(4)}(0)}{4!} = 3 \\implies f^{(4)}(0) = 3 \\times 24 = 72$.\nDue to symmetry, $g(y)$ has the same form, so $g(0) = 1$, $g''(0) = -6$, and $g^{(4)}(0) = 72$.\nNow we compute $S$:\n$$\nS = (72)(1) + 2(-6)(-6) + (1)(72)\n$$\n$$\nS = 72 + 2(36) + 72 = 72 + 72 + 72 = 216\n$$\nSince $S = (\\nabla^4 \\Phi)(0,0) = 216 \\neq 0$, the biharmonic equation is not satisfied. Thus, the stress field generated by the given $\\Phi$, while statically admissible, is not kinematically admissible and does not represent a valid solution to an elasticity problem in the interior of the domain $\\Omega$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{216}\n$$", "id": "2636649"}]}
