It presents a standard exercise in continuum thermomechanics, specifically the thermodynamics of deformable solids. All terms are defined within this established framework, and the required derivation follows from fundamental principles. The problem is valid.\n\nWe will proceed with the derivation as requested.\n\nThe analysis is based on two fundamental laws of continuum physics: the balance of energy (First Law of Thermodynamics) and the entropy inequality (Second Law of Thermodynamics). We will consistently use the local (or field) forms of these laws. The problem specifies a small-strain setting, which implies that the material density $\\rho$ can be treated as a constant, and there is no distinction between material and spatial derivatives for scalar fields. All thermodynamic quantities are expressed per unit volume.\n\n**Part 1: Derivation of the Rate of Change of Internal Energy Density**\n\nThe local form of the First Law of Thermodynamics, representing the balance of energy, states that the rate of change of internal energy density at a material point is equal to the sum of the stress power (rate of work done by stresses), the heat supplied by internal sources, and the heat entering the point due to conduction. In indicial notation, this is:\n$$ \\dot{e} = \\sigma_{ij} \\dot{\\varepsilon}_{ij} - q_{k,k} + r $$\nHere, $\\dot{e}$ is the rate of change of internal energy density (J/m$^3\\cdot$s), $\\sigma_{ij}$ is the Cauchy stress tensor, $\\dot{\\varepsilon}_{ij}$ is the small-strain rate tensor, $q_{k,k} = \\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{q}$ is the divergence of the heat flux vector $\\mathbf{q}$, and $r$ is the volumetric heat supply rate (W/m$^3$). The term $\\sigma_{ij} \\dot{\\varepsilon}_{ij}$ represents the stress power density. In direct notation, the equation is:\n$$ \\dot{e} = \\boldsymbol{\\sigma} : \\dot{\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}} - \\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{q} + r $$\n\nWe now specialize this general equation to the conditions given in the problem statement.\n1.  The deformation is uniaxial small-strain along the bar's axis. Let this be the $x_1$ direction. The only non-zero component of the Cauchy stress tensor is $\\sigma_{11}$, which is denoted as $\\sigma(t)$. The corresponding strain rate component is $\\dot{\\varepsilon}_{11}$, denoted as $\\dot{\\varepsilon}(t)$. Therefore, the stress power density simplifies significantly:\n    $$ \\boldsymbol{\\sigma} : \\dot{\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}} = \\sigma_{ij} \\dot{\\varepsilon}_{ij} = \\sigma_{11} \\dot{\\varepsilon}_{11} = \\sigma(t)\\dot{\\varepsilon}(t) $$\n    The other terms in the tensor contraction are zero because the corresponding stress components are zero for a state of uniaxial stress.\n\n2.  The bar is perfectly insulated, meaning there is \"no heat flux anywhere in the body or across its boundary\". This translates to the mathematical condition that the heat flux vector is identically zero: $\\mathbf{q} = \\mathbf{0}$. Consequently, its divergence must also be zero:\n    $$ \\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{q} = 0 $$\n\n3.  The volumetric heat supply is given as a function of time, $r(t)$.\n\nSubstituting these specialized conditions into the general form of the First Law, we obtain:\n$$ \\dot{e}(t) = \\sigma(t)\\dot{\\varepsilon}(t) - 0 + r(t) $$\nThis provides the explicit formula for the rate of change of internal energy density under the stated conditions.\n\n**Part 2: Adiabatic and Isentropic Processes**\n\nThe Second Law of Thermodynamics, in the form of the Clausius-Duhem inequality, governs the production of entropy and places restrictions on constitutive relations. The local form of this inequality is:\n$$ \\rho \\dot{s} - \\frac{\\rho r}{T} + \\nabla \\cdot \\left(\\frac{\\mathbf{q}}{T}\\right) \\ge 0 $$\nwhere $s$ is the entropy density per unit mass and $T$ is the absolute temperature. Expanding the divergence term, we get:\n$$ \\rho \\dot{s} - \\frac{\\rho r}{T} + \\frac{1}{T}\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{q} - \\frac{1}{T^2} \\mathbf{q} \\cdot \\nabla T \\ge 0 $$\nFor small strains, we can write this per unit volume using entropy density $s_v = \\rho s$, where $\\dot{s_v} = \\rho \\dot{s}$:\n$$ \\dot{s_v} - \\frac{r}{T} + \\frac{1}{T}\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{q} - \\frac{1}{T^2} \\mathbf{q} \\cdot \\nabla T \\ge 0 $$\nThe total rate of internal dissipation per unit volume, $\\mathcal{D}_{int}$, is the quantity on the left-hand side multiplied by $T$:\n$$ \\mathcal{D}_{int} = T\\dot{s_v} - r + \\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{q} - \\frac{1}{T}\\mathbf{q} \\cdot \\nabla T \\ge 0 $$\nUsing the First Law, $\\dot{e} = \\sigma:\\dot{\\varepsilon} - \\nabla\\cdot\\mathbf{q} + r$, this can be rewritten as the familiar expression $\\mathcal{D}_{int} = \\boldsymbol{\\sigma} : \\dot{\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}} - (\\dot{e} - T\\dot{s_v}) - \\frac{1}{T}\\mathbf{q} \\cdot \\nabla T \\ge 0$.\n\nFor this problem, the condition $\\mathbf{q} = \\mathbf{0}$ simplifies the inequality drastically. The terms $\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{q}$ and $\\mathbf{q} \\cdot \\nabla T$ both vanish. The Clausius-Duhem inequality reduces to:\n$$ T\\dot{s_v} - r \\ge 0 $$\n\nNow, we can identify the thermodynamic conditions for adiabatic and isentropic loading.\n\n**Adiabatic Loading**: An adiabatic process is one in which there is no heat exchange with the surroundings. In a local continuum description, this corresponds to setting both the heat flux and any internal heat sources to zero.\n-   **Conditions**: $\\mathbf{q} = \\mathbf{0}$ and $r(t) = 0$.\n-   **First Law**: Substituting $r=0$ into the result from Part 1 gives:\n    $$ \\dot{e}(t) = \\sigma(t)\\dot{\\varepsilon}(t) $$\n    This means that in an adiabatic process, the rate of work done by the stresses is entirely converted into a change in the material's internal energy.\n-   **Second Law**: Substituting $r=0$ into our simplified Clausius-Duhem inequality ($T\\dot{s_v} - r \\ge 0$) gives:\n    $$ T\\dot{s_v} \\ge 0 $$\n    Since absolute temperature $T$ must be positive, this implies $\\dot{s_v} \\ge 0$. The term $\\mathcal{D}_{mech} = T\\dot{s_v}$ represents the rate of energy dissipation due to internal irreversible mechanisms (e.g., plasticity, viscoelasticity). The Second Law thus states that for any adiabatic process, entropy cannot decrease; it increases if there are internal dissipative effects and remains constant otherwise.\n\n**Isentropic Loading**: An isentropic process is one that is both adiabatic and reversible.\n-   **Conditions**: It must be adiabatic ($\\mathbf{q} = \\mathbf{0}, r = 0$), and it must be internally reversible. Reversibility means that there is no internal dissipation.\n-   **Second Law**: The condition of zero internal dissipation means that the mechanical dissipation rate must be zero:\n    $$ \\mathcal{D}_{mech} = T\\dot{s_v} = 0 $$\n    Because $T>0$, this directly implies that the rate of change of entropy is zero:\n    $$ \\dot{s_v} = 0 $$\n    This is the definition of an isentropic (constant entropy) process.\n-   **First Law**: The relation $\\dot{e}(t) = \\sigma(t)\\dot{\\varepsilon}(t)$ remains the same as for the general adiabatic case. However, the nature of the internal energy change is different. In an isentropic process (e.g., ideal elasticity), the internal energy is stored in a fully recoverable manner, whereas in a general adiabatic process with dissipation, some portion of the stress power is irreversibly converted to heat, increasing both temperature and entropy.\n\nIn summary, the key distinction is that **adiabatic** loading ($\\mathbf{q}=\\mathbf{0}, r=0$) only requires thermal isolation, permitting internal irreversibilities that cause entropy to increase ($\\dot{s_v} \\ge 0$). In contrast, **isentropic** loading requires both thermal isolation and internal reversibility, which forces the entropy to remain constant ($\\dot{s_v} = 0$). An isentropic process is therefore a special, idealized case of an adiabatic process.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\sigma(t)\\dot{\\varepsilon}(t) + r(t)}$$", "id": "2925215"}, {"introduction": "Building on the local energy balance, this exercise [@problem_id:2702487] explores a classic and vital application: the self-heating of materials during rapid plastic deformation.
