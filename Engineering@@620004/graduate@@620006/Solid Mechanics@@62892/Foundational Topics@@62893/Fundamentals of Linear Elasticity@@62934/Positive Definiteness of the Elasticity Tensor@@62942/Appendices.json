It is well-posed, scientifically grounded, and provides all necessary information for a complete analysis. It is therefore valid. We proceed with the solution.\n\nThe problem requires a three-part analysis of a given Kelvin-mapped stiffness matrix $\\mathbf{C}$ to determine its positive definiteness, which is a condition for the thermodynamic stability of the corresponding elastic material.\n\nTask 1: Criterion for Positive Definiteness and Thermodynamic Stability\n\nThe strain energy density $W$ stored in a linear elastic material under a small strain $\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}$ is given by the quadratic form $W(\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}) = \\frac{1}{2}\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon} : \\mathbb{C} : \\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}$. In the provided Kelvin-Voigt representation, this is expressed as $W(\\widehat{\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}}) = \\frac{1}{2}\\widehat{\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}}^{\\mathsf{T}}\\mathbf{C}\\,\\widehat{\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}}$, where $\\mathbf{C}$ is a $6 \\times 6$ symmetric matrix and $\\widehat{\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}}$ is a $6 \\times 1$ vector of strain components.\n\nThe second law of thermodynamics, applied to an isolated mechanical system undergoing an adiabatic process from a stable equilibrium state, dictates that the internal energy cannot decrease. For a deformed elastic body, this internal energy is the strain energy. Thus, for a material to be thermodynamically stable, any non-zero strain state must correspond to a strictly positive strain energy density, i.e., $W > 0$. If $W$ could be zero or negative for some non-zero strain, the material could spontaneously deform without external work input, or even release energy upon deformation, indicating an unstable state.\n\nThe mathematical criterion for a symmetric matrix $\\mathbf{C}$ to be positive definite is that the quadratic form $\\mathbf{x}^{\\mathsf{T}}\\mathbf{C}\\mathbf{x}$ must be strictly positive for all non-zero vectors $\\mathbf{x} \\in \\mathbb{R}^6$. In our context, the vector $\\mathbf{x}$ is the strain vector $\\widehat{\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}}$.\n\nTherefore, the condition for thermodynamic stability, $W(\\widehat{\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}}) > 0$ for all $\\widehat{\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}} \\neq \\mathbf{0}$, translates directly to $\\frac{1}{2}\\widehat{\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}}^{\\mathsf{T}}\\mathbf{C}\\,\\widehat{\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}} > 0$. Since $\\frac{1}{2}$ is a positive scalar, this is equivalent to $\\widehat{\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}}^{\\mathsf{T}}\\mathbf{C}\\,\\widehat{\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}} > 0$ for all $\\widehat{\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}} \\neq \\mathbf{0}$. This is precisely the mathematical definition of positive definiteness for the matrix $\\mathbf{C}$. Thus, the positive definiteness of $\\mathbf{C}$ is the necessary and sufficient condition for the thermodynamic stability of the material model.\n\nTask 2: Sylvester's Criterion\n\nSylvester's criterion states that a symmetric matrix is positive definite if and only if all of its leading principal minors are strictly positive. A leading principal minor of order $k$, denoted $\\Delta_k$, is the determinant of the upper-left $k \\times k$ submatrix. We compute these for the given matrix $\\mathbf{C}$:\n$$\n\\mathbf{C} \\;=\\;\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n20 & 8 & 7 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n8 & 18 & 6 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n7 & 6 & 15 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 0 & 5 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 6 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 7\n\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\n\n$\\Delta_1 = \\det(20) = 20$.\n\n$\\Delta_2 = \\det\\begin{pmatrix} 20 & 8 \\\\ 8 & 18 \\end{pmatrix} = (20)(18) - (8)(8) = 360 - 64 = 296$.\n\n$\\Delta_3 = \\det\\begin{pmatrix} 20 & 8 & 7 \\\\ 8 & 18 & 6 \\\\ 7 & 6 & 15 \\end{pmatrix} = 20(18 \\cdot 15 - 6 \\cdot 6) - 8(8 \\cdot 15 - 6 \\cdot 7) + 7(8 \\cdot 6 - 18 \\cdot 7)$\n$= 20(270 - 36) - 8(120 - 42) + 7(48 - 126)$\n$= 20(234) - 8(78) + 7(-78) = 4680 - 624 - 546 = 3510$.\n\nThe matrix $\\mathbf{C}$ is block-diagonal. This structure simplifies the calculation of the remaining determinants.\nFor $k > 3$, the $k \\times k$ leading principal submatrix is also block-diagonal.\n$\\Delta_4 = \\det\\begin{pmatrix} \\mathbf{C}_{1:3,1:3} & \\mathbf{0} \\\\ \\mathbf{0} & 5 \\end{pmatrix} = \\Delta_3 \\cdot 5 = 3510 \\cdot 5 = 17550$.\n\n$\\Delta_5 = \\det\\begin{pmatrix} \\mathbf{C}_{1:4,1:4} & \\mathbf{0} \\\\ \\mathbf{0} & 6 \\end{pmatrix} = \\Delta_4 \\cdot 6 = 17550 \\cdot 6 = 105300$.\n\n$\\Delta_6 = \\det(\\mathbf{C}) = \\Delta_5 \\cdot 7 = 105300 \\cdot 7 = 737100$.\n\nAll leading principal minors are strictly positive: $\\Delta_1=20$, $\\Delta_2=296$, $\\Delta_3=3510$, $\\Delta_4=17550$, $\\Delta_5=105300$, and $\\Delta_6=737100$. Therefore, according to Sylvester's criterion, the matrix $\\mathbf{C}$ is positive definite.\n\nTask 3: Eigenvalue Analysis\n\nAn alternative, equivalent criterion for a symmetric matrix to be positive definite is that all of its eigenvalues must be strictly positive.\nThe matrix $\\mathbf{C}$ is block-diagonal, of the form $\\mathbf{C} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\mathbf{A} & \\mathbf{0} \\\\ \\mathbf{0} & \\mathbf{B} \\end{pmatrix}$, where\n$$\n\\mathbf{A} = \\begin{pmatrix} 20 & 8 & 7 \\\\ 8 & 18 & 6 \\\\ 7 & 6 & 15 \\end{pmatrix} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\mathbf{B} = \\begin{pmatrix} 5 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 6 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 7 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe eigenvalues of a block-diagonal matrix are the union of the eigenvalues of its constituent blocks.\n\nThe eigenvalues of the diagonal block $\\mathbf{B}$ are its diagonal entries: $\\lambda_4 = 5$, $\\lambda_5 = 6$, and $\\lambda_6 = 7$. These are all positive.\n\nTo find the eigenvalues of block $\\mathbf{A}$, we solve the characteristic equation $\\det(\\mathbf{A} - \\lambda\\mathbf{I}) = 0$:\n$$\n\\det\\begin{pmatrix} 20-\\lambda & 8 & 7 \\\\ 8 & 18-\\lambda & 6 \\\\ 7 & 6 & 15-\\lambda \\end{pmatrix} = 0\n$$\nExpanding the determinant gives the characteristic polynomial:\n$(20-\\lambda)((18-\\lambda)(15-\\lambda) - 36) - 8(8(15-\\lambda) - 42) + 7(48 - 7(18-\\lambda)) = 0$\n$(20-\\lambda)(\\lambda^2 - 33\\lambda + 234) - 8(78 - 8\\lambda) + 7(-78 + 7\\lambda) = 0$\n$-\\lambda^3 + (20+33)\\lambda^2 + (-234-660+64+49)\\lambda + (4680-624-546) = 0$\n$-\\lambda^3 + 53\\lambda^2 - 781\\lambda + 3510 = 0$\n$\\lambda^3 - 53\\lambda^2 + 781\\lambda - 3510 = 0$\n\nWe seek roots of this polynomial. By the rational root theorem, we test integer divisors of $3510$. Testing $\\lambda=10$:\n$10^3 - 53(10^2) + 781(10) - 3510 = 1000 - 5300 + 7810 - 3510 = 8810 - 8810 = 0$.\nSo, $\\lambda_1 = 10$ is an eigenvalue. We perform polynomial division of $(\\lambda^3 - 53\\lambda^2 + 781\\lambda - 3510)$ by $(\\lambda-10)$, yielding the quadratic factor $\\lambda^2 - 43\\lambda + 351 = 0$.\nWe solve for the remaining two eigenvalues using the quadratic formula:\n$\\lambda = \\frac{-(-43) \\pm \\sqrt{(-43)^2 - 4(1)(351)}}{2(1)} = \\frac{43 \\pm \\sqrt{1849 - 1404}}{2} = \\frac{43 \\pm \\sqrt{445}}{2}$.\nSo, the eigenvalues of $\\mathbf{A}$ are $\\lambda_1 = 10$, $\\lambda_2 = \\frac{43 - \\sqrt{445}}{2}$, and $\\lambda_3 = \\frac{43 + \\sqrt{445}}{2}$.\n\nTo confirm these are positive, we observe:\n$\\lambda_1=10 > 0$.\n$\\lambda_3 = \\frac{43 + \\sqrt{445}}{2} > 0$.\nFor $\\lambda_2$, we must check if $43 > \\sqrt{445}$. Squaring both sides, we check if $43^2 > 445$. Since $43^2 = 1849$, and $1849 > 445$, the inequality holds, and thus $\\lambda_2 > 0$.\n\nThe complete set of eigenvalues for $\\mathbf{C}$ is $\\{10, \\frac{43 - \\sqrt{445}}{2}, \\frac{43 + \\sqrt{445}}{2}, 5, 6, 7\\}$. All six eigenvalues are strictly positive. This confirms, independently of Sylvester's criterion, that $\\mathbf{C}$ is positive definite.\n\nTo find the smallest eigenvalue, we must compare the values. We have the integers $5$, $6$, $7$, $10$. We must compare the smallest of these, $5$, with the other eigenvalues from block $\\mathbf{A}$. We already established $10 > 5$ and $\\frac{43 + \\sqrt{445}}{2} > \\frac{43}{2} = 21.5 > 5$. We need to compare $5$ with $\\frac{43 - \\sqrt{445}}{2}$.\nIs $5 < \\frac{43 - \\sqrt{445}}{2}$?\nThis is equivalent to $10 < 43 - \\sqrt{445}$, which simplifies to $\\sqrt{445} < 33$.\nSquaring both sides gives $445 < 33^2$, or $445 < 1089$. This inequality is true.\nTherefore, $5$ is smaller than all three eigenvalues of $\\mathbf{A}$. The smallest eigenvalue of $\\mathbf{C}$ is $5$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{5}\n$$", "id": "2672807"}, {"introduction": "Beyond simply verifying a given material's stability, the principle of positive definiteness serves as a powerful tool for deriving fundamental constraints on the allowable range of elastic constants.

It presents a standard problem in the theory of linear elasticity for anisotropic materials, based on established principles of continuum mechanics and thermodynamics. All necessary data and definitions are provided, and no contradictions or ambiguities are present. Therefore, the problem is valid, and a solution will be provided.\n\nThe strain energy density, $w(\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon})$, for a linearly elastic material is a quadratic form of the strain tensor components. For a plane stress problem in an orthotropic material, the in-plane strain vector can be written as $\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\varepsilon_1 & \\varepsilon_2 & \\gamma_{12} \\end{pmatrix}^{\\mathsf{T}}$. The strain energy density is given by $w(\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}) = \\frac{1}{2}\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}^{\\mathsf{T}}\\mathbf{C}\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}$, where $\\mathbf{C}$ is the reduced in-plane stiffness matrix. The fundamental requirement of thermodynamic stability dictates that the strain energy density must be positive for any non-zero strain state, i.e., $w(\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}) > 0$ for all $\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon} \\neq \\mathbf{0}$. From the theory of quadratic forms, this condition is equivalent to the requirement that the matrix $\\mathbf{C}$ be positive definite. Furthermore, by Maxwell's relations derived from a thermodynamic potential, the stiffness matrix $\\mathbf{C}$ must be symmetric. Thus, the problem reduces to finding the conditions under which the symmetric stiffness matrix $\\mathbf{C}$ is positive definite.\n\nFirst, we derive the reduced stiffness matrix $\\mathbf{C}$ for the plane stress state. We begin with the compliance relation $\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon} = \\mathbf{S}\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}$, where $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\sigma_1 & \\sigma_2 & \\tau_{12} \\end{pmatrix}^{\\mathsf{T}}$ is the stress vector.

This is consistent with the information provided. The stiffness matrix $\\mathbf{C}$ is the inverse of the compliance matrix, $\\mathbf{C} = \\mathbf{S}^{-1}$.

In this $2$D plane-stress case, with $\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\varepsilon_{xx} & \\varepsilon_{yy} & \\gamma_{xy} \\end{pmatrix}^{\\mathsf{T}}$, the strain energy density is:\n$$\nW = \\frac{1}{2}\\,\\begin{pmatrix} \\varepsilon_{xx} & \\varepsilon_{yy} & \\gamma_{xy} \\end{pmatrix}\n\\begin{pmatrix}\nt & c & 0 \\\\\nc & 1 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 1\n\\end{pmatrix}\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n\\varepsilon_{xx} \\\\\n\\varepsilon_{yy} \\\\\n\\gamma_{xy}\n\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nExpanding this expression gives:\n$$\nW = \\frac{1}{2} (t\\varepsilon_{xx}^2 + 2c\\varepsilon_{xx}\\varepsilon_{yy} + \\varepsilon_{yy}^2 + \\gamma_{xy}^2)\n$$\nThermodynamic stability requires that $W \\ge 0$ for any non-zero strain $\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}$. This is equivalent to the condition that the stiffness matrix $\\mathbf{C}$ must be positive semidefinite. A symmetric matrix is positive semidefinite if and only if all of its principal minors are non-negative.\n\nThe problem states that the leading principal minor of order $1$ must be zero. The leading principal minors are the determinants of the upper-left sub-matrices. The first leading principal minor, $\\Delta_1$, is the determinant of the top-left $1 \\times 1$ block of $\\mathbf{C}$:\n$$\n\\Delta_1 = \\det([t]) = t\n$$\nSetting this to zero, as required by the problem, yields the condition $t=0$. This is consistent with the given domain $t \\ge 0$.\n\nWith $t=0$, the stiffness matrix becomes:\n$$\n\\mathbf{C}(0,c) \\;=\\;\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n0 & c & 0 \\\\\nc & 1 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 1\n\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nNow we must enforce the condition that this matrix is positive semidefinite. We examine all its principal minors:\n\\begin{enumerate}\n    \\item Principal minors of order $1$: These are the diagonal elements, which are $0$, $1$, and $1$. All are non-negative, so this condition is satisfied.\n    \\item Principal minors of order $2$: These are the determinants of the $2 \\times 2$ principal sub-matrices.\n    \\begin{itemize}\n        \\item Sub-matrix from rows/columns $1$ and $2$: $\\det \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & c \\\\ c & 1 \\end{pmatrix} = (0)(1) - (c)(c) = -c^2$.\n        \\item Sub-matrix from rows/columns $1$ and $3$: $\\det \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} = 0$.\n        \\item Sub-matrix from rows/columns $2$ and $3$: $\\det \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} = 1$.\n    \\end{itemize}\n    For positive semidefiniteness, all these must be non-negative. The conditions are $-c^2 \\ge 0$, $0 \\ge 0$, and $1 \\ge 0$. Since $c$ is a real parameter, $c^2$ is always non-negative, meaning $-c^2$ is always non-positive. The only way to satisfy $-c^2 \\ge 0$ is for $c^2$ to be exactly zero. This implies $c=0$.\n    \\item Principal minor of order $3$: This is the determinant of the full matrix $\\mathbf{C}(0,c)$.\n    $$\n    \\det(\\mathbf{C}(0,c)) = \\det \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & c & 0 \\\\ c & 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} = 0 \\cdot \\det \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} - c \\cdot \\det \\begin{pmatrix} c & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} + 0 = -c(c) = -c^2\n    $$\n    The condition that this minor be non-negative, $-c^2 \\ge 0$, again forces $c=0$.\n\\end{enumerate}\nThus, for the matrix $\\mathbf{C}(t,c)$ with $t=0$ to be positive semidefinite, the parameter $c$ must be $0$.\n\nLet us verify the resulting matrix for $t=0$ and $c=0$:\n$$\n\\mathbf{C} \\;=\\;\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n0 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 1 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 1\n\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThis matrix is positive semidefinite because its eigenvalues are $\\lambda_1=0$, $\\lambda_2=1$, and $\\lambda_3=1$, all of which are non-negative. It is not positive definite because one eigenvalue is zero. This corresponds to marginal stability.\n\nThe zero-energy deformation mode is the non-zero strain vector $\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}_{zero}$ that lies in the null space of $\\mathbf{C}$, for which $W=0$.\nWith $t=0$ and $c=0$, the strain energy is:\n$$\nW = \\frac{1}{2} (0 \\cdot \\varepsilon_{xx}^2 + 2 \\cdot 0 \\cdot \\varepsilon_{xx}\\varepsilon_{yy} + \\varepsilon_{yy}^2 + \\gamma_{xy}^2) = \\frac{1}{2}(\\varepsilon_{yy}^2 + \\gamma_{xy}^2)\n$$\nTo have zero strain energy ($W=0$), we must have $\\varepsilon_{yy}=0$ and $\\gamma_{xy}=0$. The component $\\varepsilon_{xx}$ is unconstrained. Therefore, any strain vector of the form\n$$\n\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}_{zero} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\varepsilon_{xx} \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nis a zero-energy mode, provided $\\varepsilon_{xx} \\ne 0$.\n\nThe physical implication of this zero-energy mode is that the material can undergo a pure uniaxial strain in the $x$-direction without storing any elastic energy. The corresponding stress vector is $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma} = \\mathbf{C} \\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}_{zero} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} \\varepsilon_{xx} \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}$. This means the material offers no resistance to extension or compression in the $x$-direction. It behaves as a mechanism, not a stiff structure, for this particular mode of deformation. This state of marginal stability is at the boundary of mechanical instability.\nThe condition on $c$ that must hold is $c=0$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{0}\n$$", "id": "2672824"}]}
