The relationship between the Second Piola-Kirchhoff stress $S$, the Green-Lagrange strain $E$, and the stored-energy function $W$ is fundamental.

The problem is scientifically sound.\n- **Well-Posed**: The question concerns the conditions under which a tensor field $S(E)$ can be expressed as the gradient of a scalar potential $W(E)$.

There are no contradictions.\n- **Other Flaws**: The problem is not trivial, unrealistic, or based on any other fallacies.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem statement is **valid**. It represents a standard, well-posed question in continuum mechanics. We will proceed to derive the solution and evaluate the options.\n\nThe fundamental premise of a hyperelastic material is that the stress work rate is equal to the rate of change of a stored elastic energy function $W(E)$. This is stated as:\n$$S : \\dot{E} = \\dot{W}$$\nSince $W$ is a function of the state variable $E$, its material time derivative $\\dot{W}$ is given by the chain rule:\n$$\\dot{W} = \\frac{\\partial W}{\\partial E} : \\dot{E}$$\nwhere $\\partial W / \\partial E$ is the gradient of the scalar field $W$ with respect to its second-order tensor argument $E$. Comparing the two expressions, we have:\n$$\\left( S - \\frac{\\partial W}{\\partial E} \\right) : \\dot{E} = 0$$\nSince this relation must hold for any arbitrary strain rate tensor $\\dot{E}$, the term in the parenthesis must be the zero tensor. This gives the core constitutive relation for hyperelasticity:\n$$S(E) = \\frac{\\partial W}{\\partial E}$$\nThe inverse problem is thus: given the stress-strain function $S(E)$, find the potential $W(E)$. This is possible if and only if $S(E)$ is a conservative field.\n\nOn a simply-connected domain, such as the open, convex set $\\mathcal{D}$, a vector (or tensor) field is conservative if and only if its curl vanishes. In the context of tensor fields, this condition translates to the symmetry of the derivative of the field. Let us write the components:\n$$S_{ij}(E) = \\frac{\\partial W(E)}{\\partial E_{ij}}$$\nThe integrability condition is the equality of mixed partial derivatives (Clairaut's theorem), assuming sufficient smoothness of $W$:\n$$\\frac{\\partial^2 W}{\\partial E_{ij} \\partial E_{kl}} = \\frac{\\partial^2 W}{\\partial E_{kl} \\partial E_{ij}}$$\nSubstituting the constitutive relation, we get:\n$$\\frac{\\partial S_{ij}}{\\partial E_{kl}} = \\frac{\\partial S_{kl}}{\\partial E_{ij}}$$\nThe term $H_{ijkl} := \\partial S_{ij}/\\partial E_{kl}$ is the material tangent stiffness tensor. The condition for the existence of $W$ is therefore $H_{ijkl} = H_{klij}$. This is known as the **major symmetry** of the stiffness tensor. It is distinct from the minor symmetries, $H_{ijkl} = H_{jikl}$ and $H_{ijkl} = H_{ijlk}$, which arise from the symmetry of the stress tensor $S$ and strain tensor $E$, respectively, and hold for any material law relating these symmetric tensors, not just hyperelastic ones.\n\nIf the major symmetry holds, the line integral of $S$ is path-independent. $W(E)$ can then be uniquely determined (up to an arbitrary constant) by integrating from a reference state, typically $E=0$, along any path $\\Gamma$:\n$$W(E) = W(0) + \\int_{\\Gamma(0 \\to E)} S(E') : dE'$$\nThe condition $H_{ijkl} = H_{klij}$ is equivalent to the statement that the integral of $S(E) : dE$ around any closed loop in $\\mathcal{D}$ is zero.\n\nNow, we evaluate each option.\n\n**A. The inverse problem is to find a scalar field $W: \\mathcal{D} \\to \\mathbb{R}$ such that $S(E) = \\partial W / \\partial E$ in the sense that $dW(E)[\\delta E] = S(E) : \\delta E$ for all virtual strains $\\delta E$. On a convex $\\mathcal{D}$ with $S$ continuously differentiable, $W$ can be recovered (up to an additive constant fixed by $W(0)=0$) by a line integral $W(E) = \\int_{\\Gamma(0 \\to E)} S(E) : dE$ that is independent of the path $\\Gamma$ if and only if $\\oint S(E) : dE = 0$ for every closed loop in $\\mathcal{D}$, equivalently if and only if the tangent $H_{ijkl}(E) := \\partial S_{ij}/\\partial E_{kl}$ satisfies the major symmetry $H_{ijkl} = H_{klij}$ almost everywhere in $\\mathcal{D}$.**\nThis statement correctly formulates the inverse problem and the relationship $S = \\partial W / \\partial E$. It correctly states the equivalences between path-independence of the line integral, the condition that all closed-loop integrals vanish, and the major symmetry condition $H_{ijkl} = H_{klij}$. These equivalences hold on a simply connected domain like the convex set $\\mathcal{D}$. The phrase \"almost everywhere\" is slightly loose for a smooth function $S$, where the condition would hold everywhere, but this does not invalidate the core logical chain. The statement is fundamentally correct.\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\n**B. It is sufficient for the existence of $W(E)$ that $S(E)$ be symmetric, i.e., $S_{ij}(E) = S_{ji}(E)$ for all $E \\in \\mathcal{D}$; no further differential constraints on $S(E)$ are required.**\nThe symmetry of the Second Piola-Kirchhoff stress tensor, $S_{ij} = S_{ji}$, is a general property derived from the balance of angular momentum and is inherent to it being conjugate to the symmetric Green-Lagrange strain tensor. This property is necessary but by no means sufficient for the existence of a stored energy function $W(E)$. As derived above, the sufficiency condition is a differential constraint on $S(E)$—the major symmetry of its tangent modulus. This statement explicitly denies the need for such a constraint.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**C. The necessary and sufficient integrability condition for the existence of $W(E)$ is that the tangent $H_{ijkl}(E) := \\partial S_{ij}/\\partial E_{kl}$ satisfy only the minor symmetries $H_{ijkl} = H_{jikl} = H_{ijlk}$; the major symmetry $H_{ijkl} = H_{klij}$ is not needed.**\nThe minor symmetries $H_{ijkl} = H_{jikl}$ and $H_{ijkl} = H_{ijlk}$ are consequences of the symmetries of the stress tensor $S$ and the strain tensor $E$, respectively. They do not ensure integrability. The necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of $W(E)$ is precisely the major symmetry, $H_{ijkl} = H_{klij}$. This statement incorrectly substitutes the minor symmetries for the required major symmetry.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. Knowledge of $S(E)$ along a single smooth loading path from $E=0$ to each target $E \\in \\mathcal{D}$ is sufficient to uniquely reconstruct $W(E)$ throughout $\\mathcal{D}$, even if measurements along other closed loops in $\\mathcal{D}$ produce nonzero values of $\\oint S : dE$.**\nThe existence of a state function $W(E)$ is conditional on the work done, $\\int S:dE$, being path-independent. A non-zero value for a closed-loop integral, $\\oint S : dE \\neq 0$, is the definitive proof that the field $S$ is non-conservative and that no such potential function $W(E)$ exists. In such a case, the material exhibits dissipation (e.g., plasticity, viscoplasticity), and the energy change depends on the process path, not just the initial and final states. Therefore, one cannot reconstruct a state function that does not exist.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**E. If $S(E)$ is continuously differentiable on the convex set $\\mathcal{D}$ and satisfies $\\partial S_{ij}/\\partial E_{kl} = \\partial S_{kl}/\\partial E_{ij}$ for all indices and all $E \\in \\mathcal{D}$, then for any $E_{0} \\in \\mathcal{D}$ the definition $W(E) = W(E_{0}) + \\int_{\\Gamma(E_{0} \\to E)} S : dE$ is path-independent and yields $S = \\partial W/\\partial E$; conversely, if $W$ exists with $S = \\partial W/\\partial E$, then the stated symmetry holds on $\\mathcal{D}$.**\nThis statement correctly formulates the necessary and sufficient condition. The condition $\\partial S_{ij}/\\partial E_{kl} = \\partial S_{kl}/\\partial E_{ij}$ is the component form of the major symmetry. The statement correctly claims that this condition (the \"if\" part) is sufficient on a convex (and thus simply-connected) set for the line integral to be path-independent, thus defining a potential $W$ such that $S = \\partial W/\\partial E$. It also correctly states the converse (the \"only if\" part), that the existence of $W$ implies this symmetry by the equality of mixed partials (Clairaut's theorem), given that $S$ is continuously differentiable. The statement is a complete and accurate representation of the integrability condition.\nVerdict: **Correct**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{AE}$$", "id": "2629874"}, {"introduction": "Building on the concept of an energy potential, we now apply it to a practical and important scenario in finite strain mechanics: an incompressible material.

I will now proceed with the solution.\n\nThe principle of virtual work states that the rate of change of stored energy is equal to the power expended by the stresses. For a hyperelastic material, we can work directly with the stored energy function. To incorporate the incompressibility constraint $J=1$, we introduce a modified energy functional using a Lagrange multiplier field $p$. We work with the energy density (energy per unit reference volume) and define a modified stored-energy function, $\\tilde{W}$:\n$$\n\\tilde{W}(\\boldsymbol{F}, p) = W(\\boldsymbol{C}(\\boldsymbol{F})) - p(J(\\boldsymbol{F}) - 1)\n$$\nThe second Piola-Kirchhoff stress tensor, $\\boldsymbol{S}$, is energetically conjugate to the right Cauchy-Green tensor, $\\boldsymbol{C}$.

Using Jacobi's formula, $\\frac{\\partial (\\det\\boldsymbol{A})}{\\partial \\boldsymbol{A}} = (\\det\\boldsymbol{A})\\boldsymbol{A}^{-\\mathsf{T}}$, and noting that $\\boldsymbol{C}$ is symmetric, we have $\\frac{\\partial (\\det\\boldsymbol{C})}{\\partial \\boldsymbol{C}} = (\\det\\boldsymbol{C})\\boldsymbol{C}^{-1}$.\nNow we can find the derivative of $J = \\sqrt{\\det\\boldsymbol{C}}$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial J}{\\partial \\boldsymbol{C}} = \\frac{\\partial (\\det\\boldsymbol{C})^{1/2}}{\\partial \\boldsymbol{C}} = \\frac{1}{2}(\\det\\boldsymbol{C})^{-1/2} \\frac{\\partial (\\det\\boldsymbol{C})}{\\partial \\boldsymbol{C}} = \\frac{1}{2J} (J^2 \\boldsymbol{C}^{-1}) = \\frac{J}{2} \\boldsymbol{C}^{-1}\n$$\nSubstituting these derivatives back into the expression for $\\boldsymbol{S}$:\n$$\n\\boldsymbol{S} = 2 \\left[ \\frac{\\mu}{2} \\boldsymbol{I} - p \\left( \\frac{J}{2} \\boldsymbol{C}^{-1} \\right) \\right] = \\mu \\boldsymbol{I} - p J \\boldsymbol{C}^{-1}\n$$\nThis is the general expression for the second Piola-Kirchhoff stress.

The physical meaning of the Lagrange multiplier $p$ is that of an indeterminate hydrostatic pressure.

The stress tensor $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}$ is given by $\\sigma_{ij} = \\frac{\\partial W}{\\partial \\varepsilon_{ij}}$.\nThe provided strain energy density is\n$$\nW(\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}) = \\frac{1}{2}\\lambda (\\operatorname{tr}\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon})^{2} + \\mu\\, \\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}:\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}\n$$\nIn index notation, this is $W = \\frac{1}{2}\\lambda (\\varepsilon_{kk})^2 + \\mu \\varepsilon_{ij}\\varepsilon_{ij}$.\nThe derivative with respect to the strain tensor components $\\varepsilon_{ij}$ yields the stress components:\n$$\n\\sigma_{ij} = \\frac{\\partial W}{\\partial \\varepsilon_{ij}} = \\frac{1}{2}\\lambda \\cdot 2 (\\varepsilon_{kk}) \\frac{\\partial \\varepsilon_{ll}}{\\partial \\varepsilon_{ij}} + \\mu \\frac{\\partial (\\varepsilon_{mn}\\varepsilon_{mn})}{\\partial \\varepsilon_{ij}}\n$$\nUsing the identities $\\frac{\\partial \\varepsilon_{ll}}{\\partial \\varepsilon_{ij}} = \\delta_{ij}$ and $\\frac{\\partial (\\varepsilon_{mn}\\varepsilon_{mn})}{\\partial \\varepsilon_{ij}} = 2\\varepsilon_{ij}$, we obtain the generalized Hooke's law for isotropic materials:\n$$\n\\sigma_{ij} = \\lambda (\\varepsilon_{kk}) \\delta_{ij} + 2\\mu\\varepsilon_{ij}\n$$\nwhere $\\varepsilon_{kk} = \\operatorname{tr}\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon} = \\varepsilon_{xx} + \\varepsilon_{yy} + \\varepsilon_{zz}$.\n\nFirst, we analyze the case of plane strain.\nThe kinematic constraint for plane strain in the $(x,y)$-plane is $\\varepsilon_{zz}=0$, $\\varepsilon_{xz}=0$, and $\\varepsilon_{yz}=0$.\nThe strain tensor components are $\\varepsilon_{ij} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\varepsilon_{xx} & \\varepsilon_{xy} & 0 \\\\ \\varepsilon_{xy} & \\varepsilon_{yy} & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$.\nThe trace of the strain tensor simplifies to $\\operatorname{tr}\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon} = \\varepsilon_{xx} + \\varepsilon_{yy}$.\nThe stress components are then:\n$$\n\\sigma_{xx} = \\lambda(\\varepsilon_{xx} + \\varepsilon_{yy}) + 2\\mu\\varepsilon_{xx} = (\\lambda + 2\\mu)\\varepsilon_{xx} + \\lambda\\varepsilon_{yy}\n$$\n$$\n\\sigma_{yy} = \\lambda(\\varepsilon_{xx} + \\varepsilon_{yy}) + 2\\mu\\varepsilon_{yy} = \\lambda\\varepsilon_{xx} + (\\lambda + 2\\mu)\\varepsilon_{yy}\n$$\n$$\n\\sigma_{xy} = \\lambda(\\varepsilon_{xx} + \\varepsilon_{yy})\\delta_{xy} + 2\\mu\\varepsilon_{xy} = 2\\mu\\varepsilon_{xy}\n$$\nThe out-of-plane normal stress is non-zero:\n$$\n\\sigma_{zz} = \\lambda(\\varepsilon_{xx} + \\varepsilon_{yy}) + 2\\mu\\varepsilon_{zz} = \\lambda(\\varepsilon_{xx} + \\varepsilon_{yy})\n$$\nUsing the engineering shear strain definition $\\gamma_{xy} = 2\\varepsilon_{xy}$, we have $\\sigma_{xy} = \\mu\\gamma_{xy}$. The in-plane stress-strain relationship in matrix form $\\widehat{\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}} = \\mathbf{Q}^{\\text{pe}} \\,\\widehat{\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}}$ is:\n$$\n\\begin{pmatrix} \\sigma_{xx} \\\\ \\sigma_{yy} \\\\ \\sigma_{xy} \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\lambda+2\\mu & \\lambda & 0 \\\\ \\lambda & \\lambda+2\\mu & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & \\mu \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} \\varepsilon_{xx} \\\\ \\varepsilon_{yy} \\\\ \\gamma_{xy} \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThus, the plane strain stiffness matrix is $\\mathbf{Q}^{\\text{pe}} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\lambda+2\\mu & \\lambda & 0 \\\\ \\lambda & \\lambda+2\\mu & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & \\mu \\end{pmatrix}$. Using the given expressions for the Lamé parameters in terms of Young's modulus $E$ and Poisson's ratio $\\nu$, where $\\mu = \\frac{E}{2(1+\\nu)}$ and $\\lambda+2\\mu = \\frac{E(1-\\nu)}{(1+\\nu)(1-2\\nu)}$, the matrix becomes:\n$$\n\\mathbf{Q}^{\\text{pe}} = \\frac{E}{(1+\\nu)(1-2\\nu)} \\begin{pmatrix} 1-\\nu & \\nu & 0 \\\\ \\nu & 1-\\nu & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & \\frac{1-2\\nu}{2} \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe reduced strain energy density for plane strain, $W^{\\text{pe}}$, is obtained by substituting the plane strain constraints into the general expression for $W$:\n$$\nW^{\\text{pe}}(\\widehat{\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}}) = \\frac{1}{2}\\lambda (\\varepsilon_{xx}+\\varepsilon_{yy})^2 + \\mu (\\varepsilon_{xx}^2+\\varepsilon_{yy}^2+2\\varepsilon_{xy}^2)\n$$\nExpressing this in terms of the engineering strain vector $\\widehat{\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}}$ with $\\gamma_{xy} = 2\\varepsilon_{xy}$:\n$$\nW^{\\text{pe}}(\\widehat{\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}}) = \\frac{1}{2}\\lambda (\\varepsilon_{xx}+\\varepsilon_{yy})^2 + \\mu (\\varepsilon_{xx}^2+\\varepsilon_{yy}^2) + \\frac{1}{2}\\mu\\gamma_{xy}^2\n$$\nThis can be written in terms of $E$ and $\\nu$ by substituting the expressions for $\\lambda$ and $\\mu$.\n\nNext, we analyze the case of plane stress.\nThe static constraint for plane stress in the $(x,y)$-plane is $\\sigma_{zz}=0$, $\\sigma_{xz}=0$, and $\\sigma_{yz}=0$.\nFrom $\\sigma_{xz} = 2\\mu\\varepsilon_{xz}=0$ and $\\sigma_{yz} = 2\\mu\\varepsilon_{yz}=0$, and since $\\mu\\neq 0$ for any physical material, we must have $\\varepsilon_{xz}=0$ and $\\varepsilon_{yz}=0$.\nThe condition $\\sigma_{zz}=0$ is used to determine the out-of-plane strain $\\varepsilon_{zz}$:\n$$\n\\sigma_{zz} = \\lambda(\\varepsilon_{xx}+\\varepsilon_{yy}+\\varepsilon_{zz}) + 2\\mu\\varepsilon_{zz} = 0\n$$\n$$\n(\\lambda+2\\mu)\\varepsilon_{zz} = -\\lambda(\\varepsilon_{xx}+\\varepsilon_{yy}) \\implies \\varepsilon_{zz} = -\\frac{\\lambda}{\\lambda+2\\mu}(\\varepsilon_{xx}+\\varepsilon_{yy})\n$$\nUsing the relations for $E$ and $\\nu$, we find $\\frac{\\lambda}{\\lambda+2\\mu} = \\frac{\\nu}{1-\\nu}$, so $\\varepsilon_{zz} = -\\frac{\\nu}{1-\\nu}(\\varepsilon_{xx}+\\varepsilon_{yy})$.\nNow we compute the in-plane stresses by substituting $\\varepsilon_{zz}$ into the general constitutive relations:\nThe trace of the strain tensor becomes $\\operatorname{tr}\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon} = \\varepsilon_{xx}+\\varepsilon_{yy}+\\varepsilon_{zz} = (1-\\frac{\\nu}{1-\\nu})(\\varepsilon_{xx}+\\varepsilon_{yy}) = \\frac{1-2\\nu}{1-\\nu}(\\varepsilon_{xx}+\\varepsilon_{yy})$.\n$$\n\\sigma_{xx} = \\lambda\\left(\\frac{1-2\\nu}{1-\\nu}(\\varepsilon_{xx}+\\varepsilon_{yy})\\right) + 2\\mu\\varepsilon_{xx} = \\frac{E\\nu}{(1+\\nu)(1-\\nu)}(\\varepsilon_{xx}+\\varepsilon_{yy}) + \\frac{E}{1+\\nu}\\varepsilon_{xx} = \\frac{E}{1-\\nu^2}(\\varepsilon_{xx}+\\nu\\varepsilon_{yy})\n$$\nBy symmetry,\n$$\n\\sigma_{yy} = \\frac{E}{1-\\nu^2}(\\varepsilon_{yy}+\\nu\\varepsilon_{xx})\n$$\nThe shear stress is unaffected by $\\varepsilon_{zz}$:\n$$\n\\sigma_{xy} = 2\\mu\\varepsilon_{xy} = \\frac{E}{1+\\nu}\\varepsilon_{xy} = \\frac{E}{2(1+\\nu)}\\gamma_{xy}\n$$\nThe in-plane stress-strain relationship in matrix form $\\widehat{\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}} = \\mathbf{Q}^{\\text{ps}} \\,\\widehat{\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}}$ is:\n$$\n\\mathbf{Q}^{\\text{ps}} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{E}{1-\\nu^2} & \\frac{E\\nu}{1-\\nu^2} & 0 \\\\ \\frac{E\\nu}{1-\\nu^2} & \\frac{E}{1-\\nu^2} & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & \\frac{E}{2(1+\\nu)} \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{E}{1-\\nu^2} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & \\nu & 0 \\\\ \\nu & 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & \\frac{1-\\nu}{2} \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe reduced strain energy density for plane stress, $W^{\\text{ps}}$, is given by $W^{\\text{ps}} = \\frac{1}{2}\\widehat{\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}}^T\\mathbf{Q}^{\\text{ps}}\\widehat{\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}}$, which expands to:\n$$\nW^{\\text{ps}}(\\widehat{\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}}) = \\frac{1}{2} \\left( \\frac{E}{1-\\nu^2}\\varepsilon_{xx}^2 + \\frac{E}{1-\\nu^2}\\varepsilon_{yy}^2 + \\frac{2E\\nu}{1-\\nu^2}\\varepsilon_{xx}\\varepsilon_{yy} + \\frac{E}{2(1+\\nu)}\\gamma_{xy}^2 \\right)\n$$\nThis simplifies to:\n$$\nW^{\\text{ps}}(\\widehat{\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}}) = \\frac{E}{2(1-\\nu^2)}(\\varepsilon_{xx}^2+\\varepsilon_{yy}^2+2\\nu\\varepsilon_{xx}\\varepsilon_{yy}) + \\frac{E}{4(1+\\nu)}\\gamma_{xy}^2\n$$\n\nFinally, we compute the ratio $\\mathcal{R}$ for the state of pure in-plane shear, defined by $\\varepsilon_{xx}=0$, $\\varepsilon_{yy}=0$, and $\\gamma_{xy}=\\gamma_0$.\nFor the plane strain case, we substitute this state into the expression for $W^{\\text{pe}}$:\n$$\nW^{\\text{pe}}(0,0,\\gamma_0) = \\frac{1}{2}\\lambda(0)^2 + \\mu(0) + \\frac{1}{2}\\mu\\gamma_0^2 = \\frac{1}{2}\\mu\\gamma_0^2\n$$\nFor the plane stress case, we substitute the state into the expression for $W^{\\text{ps}}$:\n$$\nW^{\\text{ps}}(0,0,\\gamma_0) = \\frac{E}{2(1-\\nu^2)}(0) + \\frac{E}{4(1+\\nu)}\\gamma_0^2 = \\frac{E}{4(1+\\nu)}\\gamma_0^2\n$$\nNow, we compute the ratio $\\mathcal{R}$:\n$$\n\\mathcal{R} = \\frac{W^{\\text{pe}}(0,0,\\gamma_0)}{W^{\\text{ps}}(0,0,\\gamma_0)} = \\frac{\\frac{1}{2}\\mu\\gamma_0^2}{\\frac{E}{4(1+\\nu)}\\gamma_0^2}\n$$\nSince $\\gamma_0 \\neq 0$, we can simplify this to:\n$$\n\\mathcal{R} = \\frac{\\frac{1}{2}\\mu}{\\frac{E}{4(1+\\nu)}}\n$$\nWe substitute the definition of the shear modulus $\\mu = \\frac{E}{2(1+\\nu)}$:\n$$\n\\mathcal{R} = \\frac{\\frac{1}{2} \\left( \\frac{E}{2(1+\\nu)} \\right)}{\\frac{E}{4(1+\\nu)}} = \\frac{\\frac{E}{4(1+\\nu)}}{\\frac{E}{4(1+\\nu)}} = 1\n$$\nThis result is expected. For a pure in-plane shear state ($\\varepsilon_{xx}=\\varepsilon_{yy}=0$), the plane strain condition $\\varepsilon_{zz}=0$ leads to $\\sigma_{zz}=\\lambda(\\varepsilon_{xx}+\\varepsilon_{yy})=0$. Conversely, the plane stress condition $\\sigma_{zz}=0$ leads to $\\varepsilon_{zz}=-\\frac{\\nu}{1-\\nu}(\\varepsilon_{xx}+\\varepsilon_{yy})=0$. Thus, for pure shear, the kinematic and static conditions of plane strain and plane stress are simultaneously satisfied, and the two physical states are identical. Consequently, their strain energy densities must be identical.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{1}\n$$", "id": "2629924"}]}
