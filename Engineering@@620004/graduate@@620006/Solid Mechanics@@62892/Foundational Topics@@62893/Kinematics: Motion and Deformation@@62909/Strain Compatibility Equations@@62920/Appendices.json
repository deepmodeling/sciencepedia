A solution will be provided.\n\nThe foundation of this problem lies in the kinematic relations of small-strain theory, which connect the components of the strain tensor $\\epsilon_{ij}$ to the gradients of the displacement vector field $\\mathbf{u} = (u_x, u_y)$. For a two-dimensional case, these relations are:\n$$ \\epsilon_{xx} = \\frac{\\partial u_x}{\\partial x} \\quad (1) $$\n$$ \\epsilon_{yy} = \\frac{\\partial u_y}{\\partial y} \\quad (2) $$\n$$ \\epsilon_{xy} = \\frac{1}{2} \\left( \\frac{\\partial u_x}{\\partial y} + \\frac{\\partial u_y}{\\partial x} \\right) \\quad (3) $$\nThe engineering shear strain is $\\gamma_{xy} = 2\\epsilon_{xy} = \\frac{\\partial u_x}{\\partial y} + \\frac{\\partial u_y}{\\partial x}$.\n\nFor a single-valued and continuous displacement field to exist, the strain components cannot be chosen as arbitrary independent functions. They must satisfy a certain condition, known as the compatibility condition. This condition arises from the mathematical requirement that we can eliminate the displacement components $u_x$ and $u_y$ from the system of equations $(1)$, $(2)$, and $(3)$. This is achieved through differentiation.\n\nWe differentiate $\\epsilon_{xx}$ twice with respect to $y$:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial^2 \\epsilon_{xx}}{\\partial y^2} = \\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial y^2} \\left( \\frac{\\partial u_x}{\\partial x} \\right) = \\frac{\\partial^3 u_x}{\\partial y^2 \\partial x} $$\nNext, we differentiate $\\epsilon_{yy}$ twice with respect to $x$:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial^2 \\epsilon_{yy}}{\\partial x^2} = \\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial x^2} \\left( \\frac{\\partial u_y}{\\partial y} \\right) = \\frac{\\partial^3 u_y}{\\partial x^2 \\partial y} $$\nSumming these two results, we get:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial^2 \\epsilon_{xx}}{\\partial y^2} + \\frac{\\partial^2 \\epsilon_{yy}}{\\partial x^2} = \\frac{\\partial^3 u_x}{\\partial y^2 \\partial x} + \\frac{\\partial^3 u_y}{\\partial x^2 \\partial y} \\quad (4) $$\nNow, we differentiate the shear strain relation. It is more convenient to use $2\\epsilon_{xy}$. We differentiate first with respect to $x$ and then with respect to $y$:\n$$ 2 \\frac{\\partial^2 \\epsilon_{xy}}{\\partial x \\partial y} = \\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial x \\partial y} \\left( \\frac{\\partial u_x}{\\partial y} + \\frac{\\partial u_y}{\\partial x} \\right) = \\frac{\\partial^3 u_x}{\\partial x \\partial y^2} + \\frac{\\partial^3 u_y}{\\partial y \\partial x^2} $$\nAssuming the displacement field is sufficiently smooth such that its third-order partial derivatives are continuous (a condition for a well-behaved physical field), the order of differentiation can be interchanged (by Clairaut's theorem on equality of mixed partials). Thus, we can write:\n$$ 2 \\frac{\\partial^2 \\epsilon_{xy}}{\\partial x \\partial y} = \\frac{\\partial^3 u_x}{\\partial y^2 \\partial x} + \\frac{\\partial^3 u_y}{\\partial x^2 \\partial y} \\quad (5) $$\nBy comparing equations $(4)$ and $(5)$, we arrive at the Saint-Venant compatibility condition for two-dimensional strain fields:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial^2 \\epsilon_{xx}}{\\partial y^2} + \\frac{\\partial^2 \\epsilon_{yy}}{\\partial x^2} = 2 \\frac{\\partial^2 \\epsilon_{xy}}{\\partial x \\partial y} $$\nThis equation ensures that a given strain field is derivable from a single-valued, continuous displacement field in a simply connected domain.\n\nNow, we apply this condition to the given strain components:\n$$ \\epsilon_{xx}(x,y) = A x^{2} + B y^{2} $$\n$$ \\epsilon_{yy}(x,y) = C x^{2} + D y^{2} $$\n$$ \\epsilon_{xy}(x,y) = E x y $$\n\nWe compute the necessary second-order partial derivatives:\nFor $\\epsilon_{xx}$:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial \\epsilon_{xx}}{\\partial y} = 2 B y $$\n$$ \\frac{\\partial^2 \\epsilon_{xx}}{\\partial y^2} = 2 B $$\n\nFor $\\epsilon_{yy}$:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial \\epsilon_{yy}}{\\partial x} = 2 C x $$\n$$ \\frac{\\partial^2 \\epsilon_{yy}}{\\partial x^2} = 2 C $$\n\nFor $\\epsilon_{xy}$:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial \\epsilon_{xy}}{\\partial x} = E y $$\n$$ \\frac{\\partial^2 \\epsilon_{xy}}{\\partial x \\partial y} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}(E y) = E $$\n\nSubstituting these results into the compatibility equation:\n$$ (2B) + (2C) = 2(E) $$\nThis equation must hold for all $(x, y)$ in the region for the strain field to be compatible.

The terms involving constants $D_1$, $D_2$, and $C$ describe a rigid-body motion. The terms $D_2$ and $D_1$ represent a uniform translation.

We proceed to the solution.\n\nThe problem is addressed in three parts as requested.\n\n**Part 1: Derivation of the Saint-Venant Compatibility Relations**\n\nThe foundation of small-strain kinematics is the relationship between the infinitesimal strain tensor $\\epsilon_{ij}$ and the displacement vector field $u_i$. In a Cartesian coordinate system $(x_1, x_2, x_3)$, this kinematic definition is:\n$$\n\\epsilon_{ij} = \\frac{1}{2} (u_{i,j} + u_{j,i})\n$$\nwhere the comma notation denotes partial differentiation, $u_{i,j} \\equiv \\frac{\\partial u_i}{\\partial x_j}$. The strain tensor is symmetric by definition, i.e., $\\epsilon_{ij} = \\epsilon_{ji}$.\n\nThe displacement field $u_i$ is given as twice continuously differentiable. A fundamental consequence of this smoothness is the equality of mixed partial derivatives (Clairaut's theorem):\n$$\nf_{,kl} = f_{,lk}\n$$\nfor any function $f$ with the required smoothness.\n\nThe compatibility conditions are derived by eliminating the displacement field $u_i$ from the system of equations defining the strain. This is achieved by taking second derivatives of the strain components to reach fourth derivatives of the displacement components, where the commutativity of differentiation can be exploited.\n\nLet us form the following combination of second derivatives of the strain components:\n$$\nR_{ijkl} \\equiv \\epsilon_{ij,kl} + \\epsilon_{kl,ij} - \\epsilon_{ik,jl} - \\epsilon_{jl,ik}\n$$\nNow, we substitute the definition of strain into this expression. For clarity, we multiply by $2$:\n$$\n2 R_{ijkl} = (u_{i,jkl} + u_{j,ikl}) + (u_{k,lij} + u_{l,kij}) - (u_{i,kjl} + u_{k,ijl}) - (u_{j,lik} + u_{l,jik})\n$$\nWe rearrange the terms on the right-hand side to group them by the displacement component being differentiated:\n$$\n2 R_{ijkl} = (u_{i,jkl} - u_{i,kjl}) + (u_{j,ikl} - u_{j,lik}) + (u_{k,lij} - u_{k,ijl}) + (u_{l,kij} - u_{l,jik})\n$$\nBecause the displacement field is twice continuously differentiable, the order of differentiation is immaterial. Thus, each term in parentheses is identically zero:\n\\begin{itemize}\n    \\item $u_{i,jkl} - u_{i,kjl} = 0$\n    \\item $u_{j,ikl} - u_{j,lik} = 0$\n    \\item $u_{k,lij} - u_{k,ijl} = 0$\n    \\item $u_{l,kij} - u_{l,jik} = 0$\n\\end{itemize}\nThis proves that the entire expression is zero: $R_{ijkl} = 0$.\n\nThe Saint-Venant compatibility relations are therefore given by the condition:\n$$\n\\epsilon_{ij,kl} + \\epsilon_{kl,ij} - \\epsilon_{ik,jl} - \\epsilon_{jl,ik} = 0\n$$\nThese are the compatibility equations in Cartesian tensor form.

By construction, the resulting strain field is compatible.\n\nTherefore, the compatibility residual tensor $C_{ijkl}$ must be identically zero for all its components.\n$$\nC_{ijkl}(x,y,z) = 0 \\quad \\text{for all } i,j,k,l \\in \\{1,2,3\\} \\text{ and for all } (x,y,z)\n$$\nAs a verification, let us check one of the non-trivial compatibility equations, which for a two-dimensional case is often written as $\\frac{\\partial^2 \\epsilon_{11}}{\\partial y^2} + \\frac{\\partial^2 \\epsilon_{22}}{\\partial x^2} = 2\\frac{\\partial^2 \\epsilon_{12}}{\\partial x \\partial y}$. This corresponds to the component $C_{1122} = \\epsilon_{11,22} + \\epsilon_{22,11} - 2\\epsilon_{12,12} = 0$. Using the computed strain components:\n$$\n\\epsilon_{11,22} = \\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial y^2}(x) = 0\n$$\n$$\n\\epsilon_{22,11} = \\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial x^2}(x) = 0\n$$\n$$\n\\epsilon_{12,12} = \\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial y \\partial x}\\left(\\frac{y}{2}\\right) = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}\\left(0\\right) = 0\n$$\nThus, $C_{1122} = 0 + 0 - 2(0) = 0$, which confirms the conclusion for this component. The same logic applies to all $3^4 = 81$ components of $C_{ijkl}$.\n\nSince every component $C_{ijkl}$ is zero, every term in the sum for $S(x,y,z)$ is zero:\n$$\nC_{ijkl}(x,y,z)\\,C_{ijkl}(x,y,z) = 0^2 = 0\n$$\nThe sum of zero terms is zero. Consequently, the value of the functional is:\n$$\nS(x,y,z) = 0\n$$\nThis result is a direct consequence of the definition of compatibility: a strain field derived from a valid displacement field must, by definition, be compatible, and any measure of its incompatibility must be zero.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{0}\n$$", "id": "2687288"}]}
