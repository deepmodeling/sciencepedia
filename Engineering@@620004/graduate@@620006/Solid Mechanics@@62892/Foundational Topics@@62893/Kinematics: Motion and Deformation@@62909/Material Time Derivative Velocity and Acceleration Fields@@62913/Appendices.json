The problem is well-posed and scientifically sound, as it is based on fundamental principles of continuum mechanics. We will proceed with a rigorous derivation.\n\nThe material time derivative, also known as the total or substantial derivative, is defined as:\n$$\n\\frac{D\\phi}{Dt} = \\frac{\\partial \\phi}{\\partial t} + v \\cdot \\nabla \\phi\n$$\nHere, $\\frac{\\partial \\phi}{\\partial t}$ is the local rate of change of the field at a fixed spatial point $x$, and $v \\cdot \\nabla \\phi$ is the convective rate of change, which accounts for the change in the field due to the motion of the material particle through a spatially varying field.\n\nWe must compute each term separately.\n\nFirst, we determine the velocity field $v(x,t)$. The motion is given by $x(X,t) = c + Q(t)(X - c)$, where $X$ is the material coordinate of a particle and $x$ is its spatial position at time $t$. The point $c$ is a fixed center of rotation. The velocity of a material particle is the time derivative of its position, holding $X$ constant:\n$$\nv(X,t) = \\dot{x}(X,t) = \\frac{d}{dt} [c + Q(t)(X - c)]\n$$\nSince $c$ is a fixed point, its time derivative is zero. Thus,\n$$\nv(X,t) = \\dot{Q}(t)(X - c)\n$$\nThis expression for velocity is in terms of the material coordinate $X$. To be useful in the material derivative formula, it must be expressed in terms of the spatial coordinate $x$. We rearrange the motion equation to express $(X - c)$ in terms of $(x - c)$. Since $Q(t)$ is an orthogonal tensor, its inverse is its transpose, $Q(t)^{-1} = Q(t)^{T}$.\n$$\nx - c = Q(t)(X - c) \\implies X - c = Q(t)^{T}(x - c)\n$$\nSubstituting this into the velocity expression gives the velocity field in spatial form:\n$$\nv(x,t) = \\dot{Q}(t) [Q(t)^{T}(x - c)] = [\\dot{Q}(t)Q(t)^{T}](x - c)\n$$\nThe term $\\dot{Q}(t)Q(t)^{T}$ is the definition of the angular velocity tensor, $W(t)$. The axial vector of this skew-symmetric tensor is the angular velocity vector $\\omega(t)$, such that $W(t)a = \\omega(t) \\times a$ for any vector $a$. Therefore, the velocity field is:\n$$\nv(x,t) = W(t)(x - c) = \\omega(t) \\times (x - c)\n$$\nThis is the standard expression for the velocity of a point in a body undergoing rigid rotation about a point $c$.\n\nNext, we evaluate the two terms of the material derivative. The scalar field is given as $\\phi(x,t) = f(r)$, where $r = \\|x - c\\|$ and the function $f$ has no explicit time dependence.\n\nThe first term is the partial time derivative, $\\frac{\\partial \\phi}{\\partial t}$. This derivative is taken at a fixed spatial position $x$. Since the function $f$ does not depend explicitly on time $t$, and its argument $r = \\|x - c\\|$ is a function of the spatial coordinate $x$ only, the scalar field $\\phi$ has no explicit time dependence. Therefore:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial \\phi}{\\partial t} = 0\n$$\n\nThe second term is the convective part, $v \\cdot \\nabla \\phi$. We first compute the gradient of the scalar field, $\\nabla \\phi$. Using the chain rule:\n$$\n\\nabla \\phi = \\nabla f(r) = \\frac{df}{dr} \\nabla r = f'(r) \\nabla r\n$$\nThe gradient of $r = \\|x - c\\| = \\sqrt{(x - c) \\cdot (x - c)}$ is:\n$$\n\\nabla r = \\nabla \\left( \\sqrt{(x - c) \\cdot (x - c)} \\right) = \\frac{1}{2r} \\nabla [ (x - c) \\cdot (x - c) ] = \\frac{1}{2r} [2(x-c)] = \\frac{x-c}{r}\n$$\nSo, the gradient of the scalar field is:\n$$\n\\nabla \\phi = f'(r) \\frac{x - c}{\\|x - c\\|}\n$$\nNow, we compute the dot product of the velocity field and the gradient of $\\phi$:\n$$\nv \\cdot \\nabla \\phi = [\\omega(t) \\times (x - c)] \\cdot \\left[ f'(r) \\frac{x - c}{\\|x - c\\|} \\right]\n$$\nThis can be rewritten as:\n$$\nv \\cdot \\nabla \\phi = \\frac{f'(r)}{\\|x - c\\|} \\left( [\\omega(t) \\times (x - c)] \\cdot (x - c) \\right)\n$$\nThe expression $[\\omega(t) \\times (x - c)]$ yields a vector that is, by definition of the cross product, orthogonal to both $\\omega(t)$ and $(x - c)$. The dot product of any vector with a vector orthogonal to it is zero. Specifically, for any two vectors $A$ and $B$, the vector $A \\times B$ is perpendicular to $B$, so $(A \\times B) \\cdot B = 0$. In our case, $A = \\omega(t)$ and $B = (x - c)$. Thus:\n$$\n[\\omega(t) \\times (x - c)] \\cdot (x - c) = 0\n$$\nConsequently, the convective term is zero:\n$$\nv \\cdot \\nabla \\phi = 0\n$$\n\nCombining the two terms, we find the material time derivative:\n$$\n\\frac{D\\phi}{Dt} = \\frac{\\partial \\phi}{\\partial t} + v \\cdot \\nabla \\phi = 0 + 0 = 0\n$$\n\nThe physical interpretation of this result is direct. The material derivative $D\\phi/Dt$ measures the rate of change of $\\phi$ as experienced by a moving material particle. The scalar field $\\phi$ is defined to be a function only of the distance $r$ from the center of rotation $c$. For a rigid rotation about $c$, every material particle maintains a constant distance from $c$. Let $x(X,t)$ be the position of a particle. Its distance from $c$ is $\\|x(X,t) - c\\| = \\|Q(t)(X - c)\\|$. Since $Q(t)$ is an orthogonal tensor, it preserves the norm, so $\\|Q(t)(X - c)\\| = \\|X - c\\|$, which is a constant for a given particle $X$. Since the particle's distance $r$ never changes, and $\\phi$ depends only on $r$, the value of $\\phi$ for that particle is constant throughout the motion. Therefore, its rate of change with time, the material derivative, must be zero.

The commutator is calculated as:\n$$\n[\\boldsymbol{L}_{1}, \\boldsymbol{L}_{2}] = \\boldsymbol{L}_{1}\\boldsymbol{L}_{2} - \\boldsymbol{L}_{2}\\boldsymbol{L}_{1} = \\begin{bmatrix} 0 & s \\\\ 0 & 0 \\end{bmatrix}\\begin{bmatrix} \\alpha & 0 \\\\ 0 & -\\alpha \\end{bmatrix} - \\begin{bmatrix} \\alpha & 0 \\\\ 0 & -\\alpha \\end{bmatrix}\\begin{bmatrix} 0 & s \\\\ 0 & 0 \\end{bmatrix}\n$$\n$$\n= \\begin{bmatrix} 0 & -s\\alpha \\\\ 0 & 0 \\end{bmatrix} - \\begin{bmatrix} 0 & s\\alpha \\\\ 0 & 0 \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} 0 & -2s\\alpha \\\\ 0 & 0 \\end{bmatrix}.\n$$\nSince $s>0$ and $\\alpha>0$, the commutator $[\\boldsymbol{L}_{1}, \\boldsymbol{L}_{2}]$ is not the zero matrix $\\boldsymbol{0}$. Because the generators of the transformations do not commute, the final deformation gradient depends on the order of operations. A direct comparison of $\\boldsymbol{F}_{\\text{A}}(t^{\\ast})$ and $\\boldsymbol{F}_{\\text{B}}(t^{\\ast})$ shows that their $(1,2)$ components differ, as $s\\tau \\exp(\\alpha \\Delta) \\neq s\\tau \\exp(-\\alpha \\Delta)$ for $\\alpha\\Delta \\neq 0$.\n\n2. We derive the expressions for the material time derivatives of the Cauchy-Green deformation tensors. The right Cauchy-Green tensor is $\\boldsymbol{C} = \\boldsymbol{F}^{\\mathsf{T}}\\boldsymbol{F}$. Its time derivative is found using the product rule and the kinematic relation $\\dot{\\boldsymbol{F}}=\\boldsymbol{L}\\boldsymbol{F}$ and its transpose $\\dot{\\boldsymbol{F}}^{\\mathsf{T}} = \\boldsymbol{F}^{\\mathsf{T}}\\boldsymbol{L}^{\\mathsf{T}}$:\n$$\n\\dot{\\boldsymbol{C}} = \\frac{d}{dt}(\\boldsymbol{F}^{\\mathsf{T}}\\boldsymbol{F}) = \\dot{\\boldsymbol{F}}^{\\mathsf{T}}\\boldsymbol{F} + \\boldsymbol{F}^{\\mathsf{T}}\\dot{\\boldsymbol{F}} = (\\boldsymbol{F}^{\\mathsf{T}}\\boldsymbol{L}^{\\mathsf{T}})\\boldsymbol{F} + \\boldsymbol{F}^{\\mathsf{T}}(\\boldsymbol{L}\\boldsymbol{F}) = \\boldsymbol{F}^{\\mathsf{T}}(\\boldsymbol{L}^{\\mathsf{T}} + \\boldsymbol{L})\\boldsymbol{F}.\n$$\nThe left Cauchy-Green tensor is $\\boldsymbol{B} = \\boldsymbol{F}\\boldsymbol{F}^{\\mathsf{T}}$. Its time derivative is:\n$$\n\\dot{\\boldsymbol{B}} = \\frac{d}{dt}(\\boldsymbol{F}\\boldsymbol{F}^{\\mathsf{T}}) = \\dot{\\boldsymbol{F}}\\boldsymbol{F}^{\\mathsf{T}} + \\boldsymbol{F}\\dot{\\boldsymbol{F}}^{\\mathsf{T}} = (\\boldsymbol{L}\\boldsymbol{F})\\boldsymbol{F}^{\\mathsf{T}} + \\boldsymbol{F}(\\boldsymbol{F}^{\\mathsf{T}}\\boldsymbol{L}^{\\mathsf{T}}) = \\boldsymbol{L}\\boldsymbol{B} + \\boldsymbol{B}\\boldsymbol{L}^{\\mathsf{T}}.\n$$\nAt time $t^{\\ast}$, the velocity gradient for Protocol A is $\\boldsymbol{L}(t^{\\ast}) = \\boldsymbol{L}_{2}$. For Protocol B, it is $\\boldsymbol{L}(t^{\\ast}) = \\boldsymbol{L}_{1}$. The evaluation of $\\dot{\\boldsymbol{C}}(t^{\\ast})$ and $\\dot{\\boldsymbol{B}}(t^{\\ast})$ uses the corresponding deformation gradient $\\boldsymbol{F}(t^{\\ast})$ and applied velocity gradient $\\boldsymbol{L}(t^{\\ast})$ for each protocol.\n\n4. We now compute the scalar difference $\\Delta_{12} = (\\dot{\\boldsymbol{B}}(t^{\\ast}))_{12}^{\\text{A}} - (\\dot{\\boldsymbol{B}}(t^{\\ast}))_{12}^{\\text{B}}$.
