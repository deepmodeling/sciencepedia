The first part correctly identifies the mathematical formulation for principal strains, as shown in our derivation. The second part presents the correct set of eigenvalues for the given strain tensor, as calculated above.\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\nB. Because a symmetric strain has $6$ independent components, taking the $6$ entries of $\\mathbf{v}$ as “eigenvalues” yields the correct set of principal strains, namely $\\{1,-1,0,0,0,2\\}\\times 10^{-3}$.\nThis statement is patently absurd. First, the number of independent components of a tensor in a given basis ($6$) is unrelated to the number of its eigenvalues ($3$ for a second-order tensor in $\\mathbb{R}^3$). Second, the components of a tensor change with the coordinate system, whereas its eigenvalues (the principal strains) are invariants. Third, the set of numbers proposed, $\\{1,-1,0,0,0,2\\}\\times 10^{-3}$, is factually different from the correctly computed principal strains $\\{ \\sqrt{5}, -\\sqrt{5}, 0 \\}\\times 10^{-3}$, where $\\sqrt{5} \\approx 2.236$. The very notion of \"taking eigenvalues of a vector\" is mathematically meaningless; eigenvalues are a property of a linear operator.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\nC. Under the rotation $\\mathbf{R}$, one finds $\\mathbf{v}'=[-1,1,0,0,0,-2]^{\\mathsf{T}}\\times 10^{-3}$, while the principal strains of $\\boldsymbol{\\epsilon}$ and $\\boldsymbol{\\epsilon}'$ coincide; therefore any procedure that attempts to define principal strains by an “eigenvalue” computation on $\\mathbf{v}$ is not invariant under basis changes and is invalid.\nThis statement provides a conclusive argument against any method based on Voigt vector components. First, we compute the rotated tensor $\\boldsymbol{\\epsilon}'=\\mathbf{R}\\,\\boldsymbol{\\epsilon}\\,\\mathbf{R}^{\\mathsf{T}}$.\n$$\n\\boldsymbol{\\epsilon}' = \\begin{bmatrix}\n0 & -1 & 0\\\\\n1 & \\phantom{-}0 & 0\\\\\n0 & \\phantom{-}0 & 1\n\\end{bmatrix} \\begin{bmatrix}\n1 & 2 & 0\\\\\n2 & -1 & 0\\\\\n0 & 0 & 0\n\\end{bmatrix} \\begin{bmatrix}\n0 & 1 & 0\\\\\n-1 & 0 & 0\\\\\n0 & 0 & 1\n\\end{bmatrix} \\times 10^{-3}\n$$\n$$\n\\boldsymbol{\\epsilon}' = \\begin{bmatrix}\n-2 & 1 & 0\\\\\n1 & 2 & 0\\\\\n0 & 0 & 0\n\\end{bmatrix} \\begin{bmatrix}\n0 & 1 & 0\\\\\n-1 & 0 & 0\\\\\n0 & 0 & 1\n\\end{bmatrix} \\times 10^{-3} = \\begin{bmatrix}\n-1 & -2 & 0\\\\\n-2 & 1 & 0\\\\\n0 & 0 & 0\n\\end{bmatrix} \\times 10^{-3}\n$$\nThe components of the new Voigt vector are $\\mathbf{v}'=[\\epsilon'_{11},\\epsilon'_{22},\\epsilon'_{33},\\epsilon'_{23},\\epsilon'_{13},\\epsilon'_{12}]^{\\mathsf{T}} = [-1,1,0,0,0,-2]^{\\mathsf{T}}\\times 10^{-3}$. This matches the statement. The principal strains are eigenvalues, which are invariant under a similarity transformation ($\\mathbf{R}$ is orthogonal, so $\\mathbf{R}^{\\mathsf{T}}=\\mathbf{R}^{-1}$). Thus, the principal strains of $\\boldsymbol{\\epsilon}$ and $\\boldsymbol{\\epsilon}'$ are identical. The Voigt vector $\\mathbf{v}$ has changed to $\\mathbf{v}' \\neq \\mathbf{v}$, while the principal strains are invariant. This demonstrates that any procedure for calculating principal strains that depends on the components of the Voigt vector is not frame-invariant and is therefore fundamentally invalid. The reasoning is correct.\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\nD. If instead one constructs the $6\\times 6$ diagonal matrix $\\operatorname{diag}(\\mathbf{v})$ and takes its eigenvalues, the results equal the principal strains, because diagonalization is invariant under orthogonal similarity.\nThis procedure is arbitrary and incorrect. The eigenvalues of the suggested matrix $\\operatorname{diag}(\\mathbf{v})$ are its diagonal entries, which are simply the components of the Voigt vector $\\{1,-1,0,0,0,2\\}\\times 10^{-3}$. As established, this is not the set of principal strains. The justification \"because diagonalization is invariant under orthogonal similarity\" is a confused and irrelevant appeal to a principle. The construction of $\\operatorname{diag}(\\mathbf{v})$ is not a diagonalization of the operator $\\boldsymbol{\\epsilon}$, nor does it have any physical or mathematical basis for yielding principal strains.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\nE. The eigenproblem that yields principal strains must be posed on the original $3\\times 3$ linear map $\\boldsymbol{\\epsilon}:\\mathbb{R}^3\\to\\mathbb{R}^3$; representing $\\boldsymbol{\\epsilon}$ as a $6$-component Voigt vector erases the operator structure and does not admit a mathematically meaningful eigenvalue problem for principal strains.\nThis statement is a correct and precise articulation of the fundamental physics and mathematics involved. The principal strains and directions are the eigensystem of the strain tensor acting as a linear operator on the three-dimensional physical space, $\\boldsymbol{\\epsilon}:\\mathbb{R}^3 \\to \\mathbb{R}^3$. The Voigt representation, $\\mathbf{v} \\in \\mathbb{R}^6$, is a convention for storing the components of the tensor. This representation discards the operator structure—that is, the rule for how $\\boldsymbol{\\epsilon}$ transforms vectors in $\\mathbb{R}^3$. Without this operator structure, an eigenvalue problem for principal strains cannot be formulated. The colleague's proposal to \"take eigenvalues of $\\mathbf{v}$\" is a manifestation of this conceptual error. The statement is fundamentally correct.\nVerdict: **Correct**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{ACE}$$", "id": "2674523"}]}
