It is a well-posed, scientifically grounded problem in tensor calculus, fundamental to solid mechanics. All necessary definitions and constraints are provided, and there are no ambiguities or contradictions. We now proceed with the derivation.\n\nThe task is to compute two derivatives of scalar functions of a second-order tensor $A$ with components $A_{ij}$. The components $A_{ij}$ are treated as independent variables. We are given the identity for the derivative of one component with respect to another:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial A_{mn}}{\\partial A_{ij}} = \\delta_{mi}\\delta_{nj}\n$$\nHere, $\\delta_{ij}$ is the Kronecker delta, which is equal to $1$ if $i=j$ and $0$ if $i \\neq j$. The Einstein summation convention is in effect for repeated indices.\n\nFirst, we will compute the derivative of the first invariant, $I_{1}$, defined as the trace of the tensor $A$.\nThe definition of $I_{1}$ is given as:\n$$\nI_{1} = A_{kk} = A_{11} + A_{22} + A_{33}\n$$\nWe differentiate $I_{1}$ with respect to a generic component $A_{ij}$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial I_{1}}{\\partial A_{ij}} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial A_{ij}}(A_{kk})\n$$\nUsing the provided differentiation rule with $m=k$ and $n=k$, we obtain:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial A_{kk}}{\\partial A_{ij}} = \\delta_{ki}\\delta_{kj}\n$$\nThe expression $\\delta_{ki}\\delta_{kj}$ involves a summation over the index $k$. Let us expand this sum:\n$$\n\\delta_{ki}\\delta_{kj} = \\delta_{1i}\\delta_{1j} + \\delta_{2i}\\delta_{2j} + \\delta_{3i}\\delta_{3j}\n$$\nWe analyze this sum for two cases.\nCase 1: $i=j$. The expression becomes $\\delta_{ki}\\delta_{ki}$. In the sum, only the term where $k=i$ will be non-zero. For example, if $i=j=1$, the sum is $\\delta_{11}\\delta_{11} + \\delta_{21}\\delta_{21} + \\delta_{31}\\delta_{31} = (1)(1) + (0)(0) + (0)(0) = 1$. In general, for $i=j$, the sum evaluates to $1$.\nCase 2: $i \\neq j$. For any value of the summation index $k \\in \\{1,2,3\\}$, at least one of the Kronecker deltas $\\delta_{ki}$ or $\\delta_{kj}$ must be zero. For instance, if $k=i$, then $\\delta_{ki}=1$, but since $i \\neq j$, $\\delta_{kj}=0$. Thus, every term in the summation is zero, and the entire sum is $0$.\nThe result, $1$ if $i=j$ and $0$ if $i \\neq j$, is precisely the definition of the Kronecker delta $\\delta_{ij}$. Therefore, the first result is:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial I_{1}}{\\partial A_{ij}} = \\delta_{ij}\n$$\n\nSecond, we will compute the derivative of the double contraction $A:A$, which is defined as $A_{kl}A_{lk}$.

We can perform the contractions in any order. Let us first contract $\\delta_{lj}$ with $A_{lk}$. This operation replaces the index $l$ in $A_{lk}$ with $j$:\n$$\n\\delta_{lj}A_{lk} = A_{jk}\n$$\nThe first term then becomes $\\delta_{ki}A_{jk}$. Now, we contract $\\delta_{ki}$ with $A_{jk}$. This replaces the index $k$ in $A_{jk}$ with $i$:\n$$\n\\delta_{ki}A_{jk} = A_{ji}\n$$\nSo, the first term evaluates to $A_{ji}$.\n\nFor the second term, we have $m=l$ and $n=k$:\n$$\nA_{kl}\\left(\\frac{\\partial A_{lk}}{\\partial A_{ij}}\\right) = A_{kl}(\\delta_{li}\\delta_{kj})\n$$\nThe summation is again over $k$ and $l$.
