By working through this calculation [@problem_id:2860867], you will gain a quantitative feel for how the asymmetry in spin-dependent scattering gives rise to spin-polarized currents.", "problem": "A ferromagnetic metal at low temperature is well described by the two-current model of spin-polarized transport, in which the spin-up and spin-down electrons carry current in parallel channels characterized by spin-resolved conductivities. Consider a sample under a uniform electric field $E$ along a given axis. Let the spin-resolved current densities be $j_{\\uparrow}$ and $j_{\\downarrow}$, with corresponding conductivities $\\sigma_{\\uparrow}$ and $\\sigma_{\\downarrow}$, defined by Ohm’s law for each spin channel. The spin current polarization $P$ is defined as the ratio of the difference to the sum of the spin-resolved current densities along the field direction. Assume that the spin-up channel corresponds to the majority-spin orientation relative to the sample’s magnetization.\n\nUsing only these definitions and the two-current model assumptions, first derive an expression for $P$ in terms of $\\sigma_{\\uparrow}$ and $\\sigma_{\\downarrow}$.

The polarization $P$ is dimensionless; round $P$ to two significant figures. The indicator $s$ is exact and unitless.", "solution": "The foundation of this problem is the two-current model for spin-polarized transport, where the total current is carried by two independent, parallel channels corresponding to spin-up ($\\uparrow$) and spin-down ($\\downarrow$) electrons. In the presence of a uniform electric field $E$, the current density for each channel follows Ohm's law. The spin-resolved current densities, $j_{\\uparrow}$ and $j_{\\downarrow}$, are given by:\n$$j_{\\uparrow} = \\sigma_{\\uparrow} E$$\n$$j_{\\downarrow} = \\sigma_{\\downarrow} E$$\nHere, $\\sigma_{\\uparrow}$ and $\\sigma_{\\downarrow}$ are the conductivities for the spin-up and spin-down channels, respectively.\n\nThe first objective is to derive an expression for the spin current polarization, $P$. The problem defines $P$ as the ratio of the difference to the sum of the spin-resolved current densities:\n$$P = \\frac{j_{\\uparrow} - j_{\\downarrow}}{j_{\\uparrow} + j_{\\downarrow}}$$\nWe substitute the expressions for $j_{\\uparrow}$ and $j_{\\downarrow}$ from the two-current model into this definition:\n$$P = \\frac{\\sigma_{\\uparrow} E - \\sigma_{\\downarrow} E}{\\sigma_{\\uparrow} E + \\sigma_{\\downarrow} E}$$\nThe electric field $E$ is a common, non-zero factor in all terms, as a current is presumed to flow. Thus, $E$ can be factored out from both the numerator and the denominator and subsequently canceled:\n$$P = \\frac{E(\\sigma_{\\uparrow} - \\sigma_{\\downarrow})}{E(\\sigma_{\\uparrow} + \\sigma_{\\downarrow})} = \\frac{\\sigma_{\\uparrow} - \\sigma_{\\downarrow}}{\\sigma_{\\uparrow} + \\sigma_{\\downarrow}}$$\nThis expression for $P$ depends only on the material-specific conductivities of the two spin channels, as required.\n\nThe second objective is to compute the numerical value of $P$. The problem provides the measured values $\\sigma_{\\uparrow} = 4.0 \\times 10^{6}\\,\\mathrm{S/m}$ and $\\sigma_{\\downarrow} = 1.0 \\times 10^{6}\\,\\mathrm{S/m}$. Inserting these values into our derived formula for $P$:\n$$P = \\frac{(4.0 \\times 10^{6}) - (1.0 \\times 10^{6})}{(4.0 \\times 10^{6}) + (1.0 \\times 10^{6})}$$\nThe scaling factor of $10^{6}$ is common to both the numerator and the denominator and thus cancels:\n$$P = \\frac{4.0 - 1.0}{4.0 + 1.0} = \\frac{3.0}{5.0} = 0.6$$\nThe instruction specifies that the result for $P$ must be rounded to two significant figures. The exact value of $0.6$ is properly written as $0.60$ to reflect this precision.\n\nThe third and final objective is to determine the value of the sign indicator $s$. The definition states $s=+1$ if the majority (spin-up) channel dominates transport and $s=-1$ otherwise. Transport dominance is determined by the relative magnitudes of the current densities, $j_{\\uparrow}$ and $j_{\\downarrow}$. Since $j = \\sigma E$, for a fixed electric field $E$, the channel with the greater conductivity will carry the greater current density and thus dominate transport.\nWe are given $\\sigma_{\\uparrow} = 4.0 \\times 10^{6}\\,\\mathrm{S/m}$ and $\\sigma_{\\downarrow} = 1.0 \\times 10^{6}\\,\\mathrm{S/m}$. A direct comparison shows that $\\sigma_{\\uparrow} > \\sigma_{\\downarrow}$. This implies that $j_{\\uparrow} > j_{\\downarrow}$. The spin-up channel, which is designated as the majority-spin channel, therefore dominates electrical transport in the material. Based on the given definition, this corresponds to a sign indicator value of $s = +1$, which we write as $1$.\n\nThe final answer is required as a row vector comprising the values of $P$ and $s$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 0.60 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}}$$", "id": "2860867"}, {"introduction": "Modern spintronics heavily relies on the ability to generate pure spin currents from ordinary charge currents, and the Spin Hall Effect (SHE) in heavy metals is a primary mechanism for achieving this.

This signal arises from the mixing of the applied current $I(t) \\propto \\sin(\\omega t)$ with the SOT-induced oscillation of the sample's resistance, which is also at frequency $\\omega$. The resulting voltage product $V(t) = I(t)R(t)$ contains a term proportional to $\\sin^2(\\omega t) = (1 - \\cos(2\\omega t))/2$, thus generating a signal at $2\\omega$. The amplitude of this $V_{2\\omega}$ signal is proportional to the driving torque.\n\nThe protocol for separating the different contributions must exploit their distinct symmetries.\n-   **Step 1: Isolate SOTs from thermal artifacts.** The problem states that SOT contributions are odd under $\\mathbf{J} \\to -\\mathbf{J}$, while thermoelectric effects (ANE), which arise from Joule heating proportional to $J^2$, are even under $\\mathbf{J} \\to -\\mathbf{J}$. Therefore, to isolate the total SOT signal, one must construct a signal combination that is odd with respect to current reversal. This is typically done by taking the difference of signals measured for opposite current polarities.\n\n-   **Step 2: Separate REE and SHE contributions.** Both SOTs are odd in $\\mathbf{J}$. However, they have different parity with respect to $\\mathbf{m}$. The REE torque ($\\mathbf{T}_{\\mathrm{FL}}$) is odd in $\\mathbf{m}$, while the SHE torque ($\\mathbf{T}_{\\mathrm{DL}}$) is even in $\\mathbf{m}$.
