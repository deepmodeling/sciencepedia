It presents a standard, simplified model of tunneling magnetoresistance based on established principles of solid-state physics. The assumptions, while idealizations, are appropriate for a theoretical derivation of this nature. All necessary information is provided. We will therefore proceed with a complete solution.\n\nThe problem asks for a derivation of the tunneling magnetoresistance (TMR) based on a two-current model for a symmetric magnetic tunnel junction (MTJ). We begin from first principles, using Fermi's golden rule, under the specified assumptions of low temperature, infinitesimal bias, and spin-conserving tunneling.\n\nAccording to Fermi's golden rule, the transition rate for an electron tunneling from an initial state $|i\\rangle$ in the first electrode to a final state $|f\\rangle$ in the second electrode is given by:\n$$\n\\Gamma_{i \\to f} = \\frac{2\\pi}{\\hbar} |M_{if}|^2 \\delta(E_i - E_f)\n$$\nwhere $M_{if}$ is the tunneling matrix element, and the delta function ensures energy conservation.\n\nAt infinitesimal bias voltage $V$ and low temperature, tunneling occurs only between states within an energy window of $eV$ around the Fermi level, $E_F$. The total current for a given spin channel is found by summing over all possible initial and final states. This summation can be replaced by an integration over energy, weighted by the densities of states (DOS) and the appropriate Fermi-Dirac distribution functions.\n\nThe net current for a spin channel $\\sigma$ flowing from electrode $1$ to electrode $2$ is proportional to the integral of the product of the DOS of occupied states in electrode $1$ and the DOS of unoccupied states in electrode $2$. For spin-conserving tunneling, a spin-$\\sigma$ electron from electrode $1$ can only tunnel into a spin-$\\sigma$ state in electrode $2$. The conductance $G = dI/dV$ for this channel is therefore proportional to the product of the spin-resolved DOS at the Fermi level for each electrode.\n$$\nG_{\\sigma} \\propto N_{1,\\sigma}(E_F) \\cdot N_{2,\\sigma}(E_F)\n$$\nThe problem states that the tunneling matrix element is spin-independent and energy-independent near $E_F$. This allows us to introduce a single constant of proportionality, $C$, which encapsulates the barrier properties and fundamental constants. Thus, the spin-resolved conductances are:\n$$\nG_{\\uparrow \\uparrow} = C \\cdot N_{1, \\uparrow}(E_F) \\cdot N_{2, \\uparrow}(E_F)\n$$\n$$\nG_{\\downarrow \\downarrow} = C \\cdot N_{1, \\downarrow}(E_F) \\cdot N_{2, \\downarrow}(E_F)\n$$\nHereafter, we will denote $N_{\\sigma}(E_F)$ simply as $N_{\\sigma}$.\n\nThe two-current model treats the total conductance as the sum of the conductances of the independent spin channels. We consider two magnetic configurations: parallel (P) and antiparallel (AP).\n\nIn the parallel (P) configuration, the magnetizations of the two electrodes are aligned. The majority spin DOS in electrode $1$ ($N_{1,\\uparrow}$) is aligned with the majority spin DOS in electrode $2$ ($N_{2,\\uparrow}$), and likewise for the minority spins. The total conductance $G_P$ is:\n$$\nG_P = G_{\\uparrow \\uparrow} + G_{\\downarrow \\downarrow} = C(N_{1,\\uparrow}N_{2,\\uparrow} + N_{1,\\downarrow}N_{2,\\downarrow})\n$$\n\nIn the antiparallel (AP) configuration, the magnetizations are opposed.

For electrode $i$, the spin polarization $P_i$ is given by:\n$$\nP_i = \\frac{N_{i,\\uparrow} - N_{i,\\downarrow}}{N_{i,\\uparrow} + N_{i,\\downarrow}}\n$$\nThis definition corresponds to the polarization of current that would flow from the ferromagnet into a non-magnetic metal.\n\nThe tunneling magnetoresistance (TMR) is defined as $\\mathrm{TMR} \\equiv (R_{AP} - R_P)/R_P$. Using the relation $R = 1/G$, we can express this in terms of conductances:\n$$\n\\mathrm{TMR} = \\frac{G_P - G_{AP}}{G_{AP}}\n$$\nSubstituting the expressions for $G_P$ and $G_{AP}$:\n$$\n\\mathrm{TMR} = \\frac{C(N_{1,\\uparrow}N_{2,\\uparrow} + N_{1,\\downarrow}N_{2,\\downarrow}) - C(N_{1,\\uparrow}N_{2,\\downarrow} + N_{1,\\downarrow}N_{2,\\uparrow})}{C(N_{1,\\uparrow}N_{2,\\downarrow} + N_{1,\\downarrow}N_{2,\\uparrow})} = \\frac{N_{1,\\uparrow}N_{2,\\uparrow} + N_{1,\\downarrow}N_{2,\\downarrow} - N_{1,\\uparrow}N_{2,\\downarrow} - N_{1,\\downarrow}N_{2,\\uparrow}}{N_{1,\\uparrow}N_{2,\\downarrow} + N_{1,\\downarrow}N_{2,\\uparrow}}\n$$\nTo express this in terms of the spin polarizations $P_1$ and $P_2$, we rearrange the polarization definition.

For a single spin channel, the electrical conductance $G$ is proportional to the sum of transmission probabilities over all available transverse modes:\n$$\nG = \\frac{e^2}{h} \\sum_{n} T_n\n$$\nHere, $e$ is the elementary charge, $h$ is Planck's constant, and $T_n$ is the transmission probability for an electron in the $n$-th transverse mode at the Fermi energy, $E_F$.\n\nIn a Magnetic Tunnel Junction (MTJ) with crystalline electrodes and a crystalline barrier, the translational symmetry in the plane transverse to the transport direction allows us to impose periodic boundary conditions over a macroscopic cross-sectional area $A$. This discretizes the transverse wavevector $\\mathbf{k}_{\\parallel} = (k_x, k_y)$. For a large area $A$, the summation over discrete modes $\\sum_n$ can be converted into a two-dimensional integral over the first Brillouin Zone (BZ) of the interface crystal structure.

The minority-spin channel, however, lacks propagating states of $\\Delta_1$ symmetry at $E_F$.\n3.  **Barrier Filtering by MgO**: MgO, being a large-gap insulator, allows tunneling only via evanescent (exponentially decaying) wavefunctions. The decay rate of these states within the barrier is critically dependent on their symmetry. The complex band structure of MgO reveals that the evanescent state with $\\Delta_1$ symmetry decays the most slowly, by orders of magnitude, compared to states of other symmetries like $\\Delta_5$.\n4.  **Conduction Asymmetry**:\n    -   In the **parallel (P) configuration**, majority-spin electrons from the incident electrode with $\\Delta_1$ symmetry find a matching, slowly decaying evanescent state in the MgO barrier. They can efficiently tunnel into available empty majority-spin $\\Delta_1$ states in the second electrode. This provides a highly efficient conduction channel, resulting in a sharp, intense peak in the transmission $T_{\\mathrm{P}}(\\mathbf{k}_{\\parallel})$ at $\\mathbf{k}_{\\parallel}=\\mathbf{0}$.\n    -   In the **antiparallel (AP) configuration**, a majority-spin $\\Delta_1$ electron from the incident electrode has no matching final state to tunnel into. In the second electrode, the spin bands are reversed, and as established, there are no available minority-spin $\\Delta_1$ states at $E_F$. This high-conductance channel is effectively blocked by symmetry mismatch.\nThis phenomenon is responsible for the enormous difference between $G_{\\mathrm{P}}$ and $G_{\\mathrm{AP}}$, and thus the giant Tunneling Magnetoresistance (TMR). The Gaussian term centered at $r=0$ in the provided model, $T_{\\mathrm{hot}} \\exp[-(r/\\sigma)^2]$, is a phenomenological representation of this $\\Delta_1$-symmetry-driven hot spot.", "answer": "```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Computes spin-resolved conductances and TMR for a model of a magnetic tunnel junction.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Grid parameters\n    N = 201\n\n    # Define the test cases from the problem statement as a list of tuples.\n    # Each tuple contains: (T_bg, T_hot, sigma, T_ring, r0, sigma_r, T_bg_AP, alpha, beta)\n    test_cases = [\n        # Case 1\n        (0.002, 0.8, 0.05, 0.02, 0.35, 0.03, 0.001, 0.05, 1.5),\n        # Case 2\n        (0.005, 0.4, 0.15, 0.0, 0.30, 0.05, 0.003, 0.1, 0.0),\n        # Case 3\n        (0.02, 0.0, 0.05, 0.1, 0.25, 0.04, 0.02, 0.0, 1.0),\n        # Case 4\n        (0.001, 0.9, 0.01, 0.0, 0.20, 0.02, 0.001, 0.02, 0.0),\n    ]\n\n    # Generate the 2D k-space grid in reduced coordinates.\n    # As per the problem description, use a uniform array on [-0.5, 0.5)\n    # created with the lower endpoint included and the upper endpoint excluded.\n    k_coords = np.linspace(-0.5, 0.5, N, endpoint=False)\n    kx, ky = np.meshgrid(k_coords, k_coords)\n    r = np.sqrt(kx**2 + ky**2)\n\n    results = []\n    for case in test_cases:\n        # Unpack parameters for the current test case\n        T_bg, T_hot, sigma, T_ring, r0, sigma_r, T_bg_AP, alpha, beta = case\n\n        # Calculate the components of the transmission functions.\n        # These are radially symmetric and depend on the magnitude r of the k-vector.\n        term_hot = T_hot * np.exp(-(r / sigma)**2) if T_hot > 0.0 else 0.0\n        term_ring = T_ring * np.exp(-((r - r0) / sigma_r)**2) if T_ring > 0.0 else 0.0\n\n        # Construct the transmission maps for Parallel (P) and Antiparallel (AP) configurations.\n        T_P = T_bg + term_hot + term_ring\n        T_AP = T_bg_AP + alpha * term_hot + beta * term_ring\n\n        # Calculate conductance G as the arithmetic mean of the transmission map over the BZ grid.\n        # This corresponds to the BZ-averaged transmission <T>.\n        G_P = np.mean(T_P)\n        G_AP = np.mean(T_AP)\n\n        # Calculate the Tunneling Magnetoresistance (TMR) ratio.\n        # Handle the case of G_AP = 0, although not expected with the given parameters.\n        if G_AP != 0:\n            tmr = (G_P - G_AP) / G_AP\n        else:\n            tmr = float('inf')\n\n        # Append the rounded results for the current case to the list.\n        results.extend([round(G_P, 6), round(G_AP, 6), round(tmr, 6)])\n\n    # Print the final results in the specified single-line format.\n    print(f\"[{','.join(map(str, results))}]\")\n\nsolve()\n```", "id": "2868283"}]}
