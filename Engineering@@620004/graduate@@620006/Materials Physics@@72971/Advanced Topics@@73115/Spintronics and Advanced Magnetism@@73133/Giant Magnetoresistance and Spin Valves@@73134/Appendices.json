The resistance of the structure depends on the relative orientation of the magnetizations in the ferromagnetic layers. This effect can be described by the two-current model, where the electron transport is treated as two independent parallel channels for spin-up ($\\uparrow$) and spin-down ($\\downarrow$) electrons.\n\nConsider a symmetric spin-valve structure F/N/F, which consists of two identical ferromagnetic (F) layers of thickness $t_F$ separated by a non-magnetic (N) spacer layer of thickness $t_N$. The electrical resistance of this multilayer depends on whether the magnetizations of the two F-layers are parallel (P) or antiparallel (AP).\n\nThe material properties are described as follows:\n- In the ferromagnetic layers, the resistivity for majority-spin electrons is $\\rho_\\uparrow$ and for minority-spin electrons is $\\rho_\\downarrow$.\n- In the non-magnetic layer, the resistivity is $\\rho_N$ for both spin channels.\n- At each F/N interface, there is a spin-dependent resistance-area product, $R_\\uparrow$ for majority spins and $R_\\downarrow$ for minority spins.\n\nAssume that the spin-flip diffusion length in all materials is much larger than the total thickness of the device. This implies that the spin of an electron is conserved as it traverses the entire structure, so spin-flip scattering can be neglected. This is often referred to as the limit of infinite spin-diffusion length.\n\nTo create a specific scenario for analysis, let's assume the following relationships between the material parameters:\n1. The spin-asymmetry ratio, $\\alpha$, is the same for scattering in the bulk of the F-layers and at the F/N interfaces: \n   $$ \\frac{\\rho_\\downarrow}{\\rho_\\uparrow} = \\frac{R_\\downarrow}{R_\\uparrow} = \\alpha $$\n2.

The solution proceeds in three stages as suggested by the problem statement: first, determining the effective interfacial asymmetry due to spin memory loss (SML); second, deriving the total resistances for parallel ($P$) and antiparallel ($AP$) magnetic configurations; and third, calculating the magnetoresistance ratio.\n\n**1. Renormalization of the Interfacial Asymmetry Parameter**\n\nThe problem introduces two key parameters for the ferromagnet/normal-metal interface: the intrinsic interfacial asymmetry parameter, $\\gamma$, and the spin memory loss parameter, $\\delta$. The parameter $\\gamma$ defines the spin-dependent interfacial resistances $r_{b\\uparrow}=r_{b}(1-\\gamma)$ and $r_{b\\downarrow}=r_{b}(1+\\gamma)$. This asymmetry is responsible for the spin-filtering effect at the interface, which gives rise to a spin-polarized current.\n\nSpin memory loss, characterized by $\\delta \\ge 0$, describes spin-flip scattering events at the interface that degrade the spin polarization of the electron current. The problem states that the SML multiplies the spin polarization of the electron flow by a factor of $\\exp(-\\delta)$. In the context of a resistive model, the spin-polarizing power of the interface is directly related to the asymmetry parameter $\\gamma$. A reduction in the transmitted spin polarization is equivalent to a reduction in the effective spin asymmetry of the interface. Therefore, the SML phenomenologically renormalizes the intrinsic asymmetry parameter $\\gamma$ to an effective value, $\\gamma_{\\mathrm{eff}}$, which is attenuated by the SML factor.\n\nThe argument is as follows: The spin-dependent part of the interface resistance is $\\mp r_b\\gamma$. This term is the source of spin selection. The SML effect, by causing spin flips, reduces the efficacy of this spin selection. The problem gives the reduction factor for the spin polarization of the current as $\\exp(-\\delta)$. We translate this directly to a reduction in the parameter that controls the spin asymmetry. Thus, the effective spin-asymmetry parameter that governs transport across the real, imperfect interface is given by:\n$$\n\\gamma_{\\mathrm{eff}} = \\gamma \\exp(-\\delta)\n$$\nAll subsequent calculations of the device resistance will use this effective parameter $\\gamma_{\\mathrm{eff}}$.

Origin of Minor Loops:**\nA minor hysteresis loop in the resistance-versus-field ($R(H)$) curve of a spin valve occurs when the external magnetic field, $H$, is swept over a range that is sufficient to reverse the magnetization of the \"soft\" ferromagnetic layer (the one with lower coercivity, $H_{c1}$) but insufficient to reverse the \"hard\" layer (the one with higher coercivity, $H_{c2}$).\n\nUnder these conditions, the magnetization of the hard layer, $\\mathbf{M}_2$, remains fixed or \"pinned\" in one direction. The magnetization of the soft layer, $\\mathbf{M}_1$, flips its orientation as the external field sweeps back and forth. This causes the relative orientation of $\\mathbf{M}_1$ and $\\mathbf{M}_2$ to toggle between parallel and antiparallel.\n\n- When $\\mathbf{M}_1$ and $\\mathbf{M}_2$ are parallel, the device is in the low-resistance state ($R_P$).\n- When $\\mathbf{M}_1$ and $\\mathbf{M}_2$ are antiparallel, the device is in the high-resistance state ($R_{AP}$).\n\nThe repeated switching of the soft layer, while the hard layer remains fixed, traces out a smaller, or \"minor,\" loop on the $R(H)$ plot.\n\n**2. Extraction of Magnetic Properties:**\nThe reversal of the soft layer is governed by its intrinsic coercivity ($H_{c1}$) and the effective bias field ($H_{\\mathrm{bias}}$) acting on it due to interlayer coupling from the hard layer. The total field experienced by the soft layer is $H_{\\mathrm{eff}} = H + H_{\\mathrm{bias}}$. Magnetization reversal occurs when this effective field overcomes the coercivity.\n\n- **Descending branch (High $H$ to Low $H$):** The soft layer, initially aligned with the field, flips when the effective field reaches $-H_{c1}$. The external field at which this happens is the negative switching field, $H_{\\mathrm{sw}}^{-}$:\n  $H_{\\mathrm{sw}}^{-} + H_{\\mathrm{bias}} = -H_{c1} \\implies H_{\\mathrm{sw}}^{-} = -H_{c1} - H_{\\mathrm{bias}}$\n- **Ascending branch (Low $H$ to High $H$):** The soft layer, now opposite to the positive field direction, flips back when the effective field reaches $+H_{c1}$. The external field at this point is the positive switching field, $H_{\\mathrm{sw}}^{+}$:\n  $H_{\\mathrm{sw}}^{+} + H_{\\mathrm{bias}} = +H_{c1} \\implies H_{\\mathrm{sw}}^{+} = H_{c1} - H_{\\mathrm{bias}}$\n\nBy measuring the two switching fields, $H_{\\mathrm{sw}}^{+}$ and $H_{\\mathrm{sw}}^{-}$, from the minor loop, we can solve for $H_{c1}$ and $H_{\\mathrm{bias}}$:\n- **Coercivity:** The full width of the minor loop is $H_{\\mathrm{sw}}^{+} - H_{\\mathrm{sw}}^{-} = (H_{c1} - H_{\\mathrm{bias}}) - (-H_{c1} - H_{\\mathrm{bias}}) = 2H_{c1}$. Therefore, the soft layer's coercivity is half the loop width: $H_{c1} = (H_{\\mathrm{sw}}^{+} - H_{\\mathrm{sw}}^{-})/2$.\n- **Bias Field:** The center of the minor loop is shifted from zero. The loop center is at $(H_{\\mathrm{sw}}^{+} + H_{\\mathrm{sw}}^{-})/2 = (H_{c1} - H_{\\mathrm{bias}} - H_{c1} - H_{\\mathrm{bias}})/2 = -H_{\\mathrm{bias}}$. Therefore, the bias field is the negative of the loop's center: $H_{\\mathrm{bias}} = -(H_{\\mathrm{sw}}^{+} + H_{\\mathrm{sw}}^{-})/2$.\n\n### Evaluation of Options\n\n- **A. Correct.** This statement accurately describes the origin of minor loops and provides the correct formulas for extracting the soft-layer coercivity and the bias field from the switching fields.\n- **B. Incorrect.** GMR is inherently hysteretic; the resistance depends on the magnetic history of the layers. This hysteresis is what creates the loops and allows for the extraction of magnetic properties.\n- **C. Incorrect.** The $R_{AP}$ state corresponds to antiparallel alignment. This is achieved when *one* layer (the soft one) reverses relative to the other (the pinned hard one). If both layers reversed simultaneously, they would remain parallel, and the resistance would stay at $R_P$.\n- **D. Correct.** The interlayer coupling field ($H_{\\mathrm{bias}}$) depends on the orientation of the hard layer, $\\mathbf{M}_2$. If an experiment is run with $\\mathbf{M}_2$ pinned along $+\\hat{x}$, the loop center will be at $-H_{\\mathrm{bias}}$. If the experiment is repeated with $\\mathbf{M}_2$ pinned along $-\\hat{x}$, the coupling field reverses, and the loop center shifts to $+H_{\\mathrm{bias}}$. The difference between the centers of the two loops is $2H_{\\mathrm{bias}}$, allowing for a clean measurement of the coupling field's magnitude.\n- **E. Incorrect.** The width of the minor loop is $2H_{c1}$, which corresponds to the coercivity of the *soft* layer, not the hard layer ($H_{c2}$).", "answer": "$$\\boxed{AD}$$", "id": "2992171"}]}
