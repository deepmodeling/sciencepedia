We must minimize $f_{\\text{GL}}$ with respect to the complex order parameter $\\psi$. Since the free energy only depends on $|\\psi|^2$, we can treat $x=|\\psi|^2$ as the minimization variable, noting that $x \\geq 0$.

The derivative $\\frac{df_{\\text{GL}}}{dx} = \\alpha(T) + \\beta x$ is strictly positive for all $x \\geq 0$. Thus, $f_{\\text{GL}}(x)$ is a strictly increasing function of $x$ in the physical domain. The minimum value of $f_{\\text{GL}}$ occurs at the boundary point $x=0$. In this case, $|\\psi|^2=0$, corresponding to the normal state where $f_{\\text{GL}}(T,0) = f_n(T)$.\n\nFor $T \\leq T_c$, we have $\\alpha(T) = \\alpha_0(T-T_c) \\leq 0$.

The criterion for this transition is that the change in the appropriate thermodynamic potential, upon introducing a single vortex, is zero. For a process at a fixed external magnetic field $\\mathbf{H}$ and temperature, the relevant potential is the Gibbs free energy, $G$.\n\nIn Gaussian units, the Gibbs free energy of a magnetic body in an external field $\\mathbf{H}$ is given by $G = F - \\frac{1}{4\\pi} \\int_V \\mathbf{H} \\cdot \\mathbf{B} \\, dV$, where $F$ is the Helmholtz free energy and $\\mathbf{B}$ is the magnetic induction inside the material.

This logarithmic term arises from the slow decay of the fields and currents far from the vortex core.\n\nThe core energy, $\\varepsilon_{core}$, accounts for the energy cost of suppressing the superconducting order parameter to zero at the center of the vortex. A detailed calculation requires the full Ginzburg-Landau theory. However, for large $\\kappa$, this contribution is small compared to the logarithmically large $\\varepsilon_{out}$. It is standard practice to treat its contribution to the total energy as an additive constant. This is physically justified because $\\varepsilon_{core}$ is proportional to the condensation energy density $H_c^2/8\\pi$ integrated over the core volume $\\sim \\pi\\xi^2$, which results in a term of the form $(\\frac{\\phi_0}{4\\pi\\lambda})^2 \\times (\\text{constant})$. The problem statement instructs us to encapsulate this short-distance physics in a dimensionless constant $c$ of order unity.\n\nThe total line energy of the vortex is the sum of the two contributions:\n$$ \\varepsilon_{vortex} = \\varepsilon_{out} + \\varepsilon_{core} = \\left(\\frac{\\phi_0}{4\\pi\\lambda}\\right)^2 (\\ln\\kappa + c) $$\nThe principal approximations made are:\n1.  **London Limit**: The use of the London model is valid for a type-II superconductor where $\\kappa = \\lambda/\\xi \\gg 1$, as the fields and currents extend over a region of size $\\lambda$ which is much larger than the core size $\\xi$.\n2.  **Core Energy Approximation**: Treating the core energy as a constant term $c$ is a valid leading-order approximation for large $\\kappa$, where the $\\ln\\kappa$ term is dominant. The constant $c$ absorbs the complexities of the core structure.\n\nFinally, we substitute the expression for $\\varepsilon_{vortex}$ into the formula for $H_{c1}$:\n$$ H_{c1} = \\frac{4\\pi}{\\phi_0} \\varepsilon_{vortex} = \\frac{4\\pi}{\\phi_0} \\left(\\frac{\\phi_0}{4\\pi\\lambda}\\right)^2 (\\ln\\kappa + c) $$\n$$ H_{c1} = \\frac{4\\pi}{\\phi_0} \\frac{\\phi_0^2}{16\\pi^2\\lambda^2} (\\ln\\kappa + c) $$\nSimplifying this expression yields the final result for the lower critical field:\n$$ H_{c1} = \\frac{\\phi_0}{4\\pi\\lambda^2} (\\ln\\kappa + c) $$\nThis expression shows that the field required to introduce a vortex depends on the fundamental flux quantum $\\phi_0$, the macroscopic length scales $\\lambda$ and $\\kappa = \\lambda/\\xi$, and a constant $c$ that accounts for the core physics.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{\\phi_{0}}{4\\pi\\lambda^{2}} (\\ln\\kappa + c)}$$", "id": "3021307"}]}
