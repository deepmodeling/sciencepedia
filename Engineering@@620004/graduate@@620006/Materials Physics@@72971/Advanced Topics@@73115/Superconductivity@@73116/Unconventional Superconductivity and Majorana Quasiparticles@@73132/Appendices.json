I will proceed with the detailed solution.\n\n### Derivation of the Solution\n\nThe central task is to find a signature unique to the formation of topological MZMs and absent for a trivial ABS. The key distinction lies in their origin:\n\n1.  **Topological Majorana Zero Modes (MZMs)** are a consequence of a change in the bulk topological invariant of the system. This change occurs at a topological phase transition (TPT), which, as stated in Principle 2, is marked by the closing and subsequent reopening of the bulk quasiparticle energy gap, $\\Delta_{\\mathrm{eff}}$. The MZMs are protected by this reopened topological gap and are intrinsically nonlocal, with one mode localized at each end of the wire.\n\n2.  **Trivial Andreev Bound States (ABSs)** are localized quasiparticle states that can form due to local perturbations, such as impurities or smooth potential variations at the wire's ends. Their energy can be accidentally tuned to zero by, for instance, a magnetic field, mimicking the zero-bias signature of an MZM in a *local* conductance measurement. However, an ABS is a purely local phenomenon and is not associated with a quantum phase transition of the entire bulk system.\n\nThe most robust distinguishing protocol must therefore probe the behavior of the **bulk** system. The provided principles give a direct method to do this.\n\nPrinciple 1 establishes a direct link between the nonlocal conductance $G_{RL}$ and the bulk gap $\\Delta_{\\mathrm{eff}}$. For a sufficiently long wire ($L \\gg \\xi$), subgap transport ($|E| < \\Delta_{\\mathrm{eff}}$) is exponentially suppressed. This means that significant nonlocal conductance can only be observed when the probing energy $E=eV$ is large enough to excite quasiparticles above the bulk gap, i.e., $|eV| \\ge \\Delta_{\\mathrm{eff}}$. Therefore, by measuring $G_{RL}$ as a function of bias voltage $V$, one can map the edge of the bulk gap.\n\nPrinciple 2 states that the TPT is defined by the closing and reopening of this very gap.\n\nCombining these two principles, the definitive signature of a TPT is the observation of the bulk gap, measured via the onset of nonlocal conductance, closing to zero at a critical magnetic field $B_c(\\theta)$ and then reopening for $B > B_c(\\theta)$. This nonlocal signature directly images the bulk phase transition.\n\nA trivial ABS, being a local state, would not be accompanied by such a dramatic evolution of the bulk properties of the entire wire. While its energy might cross zero, the bulk of the wire remains gapped throughout. Therefore, the nonlocal conductance at low bias energies should remain exponentially suppressed, in stark contrast to the gapless behavior at the TPT.\n\nThe complete experimental signature of MZM formation would thus be the observation of the nonlocal gap closing and reopening, correlated with the simultaneous emergence of stable zero-bias peaks in the *local* conductances at both ends, $G_{LL}(0)$ and $G_{RR}(0)$, only for fields $B > B_c(\\theta)$.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A.** This option proposes a protocol that is in exact agreement with the reasoning derived above.\n-   It uses nonlocal conductance $G_{RL}(V,B,\\theta_0)$ to map the bulk spectral gap.\n-   It correctly identifies the signature of a TPT as the closing of this nonlocal gap (loci of high $|G_{RL}|$ moving to $V=0$) as $B \\to B_c$ and its subsequent reopening for $B > B_c$.\n-   It correctly states that for a long wire, $G_{RL}$ should be suppressed near zero bias away from the transition point, as per Principle 1.\n-   It couples this bulk measurement with the expected local signatures: the co-emergence of zero-bias peaks in $G_{LL}$ and $G_{RR}$ precisely in the topological phase ($B > B_c$).\n-   Finally, it includes a crucial control experiment: rotating the field angle $\\theta$ to destroy the topological phase, which should cause the nonlocal gap-closing signature to vanish. This confirms the anisotropic nature of the spin-orbit-coupling-induced TPT.\nThis protocol is comprehensive and directly tests for the defining characteristic of the TPT.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B.** This option suggests relying exclusively on a local measurement, $G_{LL}(0) \\approx 2e^2/h$. This is explicitly contrary to the problem's constraint to \"base... primarily on nonlocal response\". Furthermore, it is now a well-established problem in the field that trivial ABSs can mimic this local signature, producing robust zero-bias peaks. This phenomenon of \"ABS impersonating MZM\" is the primary motivation for developing more sophisticated protocols like nonlocal spectroscopy. Relying on this signature alone is insufficient and unreliable for a definitive distinction.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C.** This option focuses on the nonlocal conductance at zero bias, $G_{RL}(0)$. While MZM-mediated transport can, in theory, lead to a nonlocal zero-bias signal, this signature is not as robust or fundamental as the bulk gap closing. The magnitude and even the sign of $G_{RL}(0)$ in the topological phase can be sensitive to microscopic details such as the hybridization between the two MZMs, which oscillates with the magnetic field. More importantly, this protocol ignores the rich information available across the full bias window, namely the evolution of the bulk gap $\\Delta_{\\mathrm{eff}}$, which is the direct manifestation of the TPT as described in the provided principles. The most significant nonlocal signal is expected at the gap closing ($B=B_c$), not necessarily persisting deep in the topological phase where the bulk gap reopens and suppresses subgap transport.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D.** This option proposes to probe the system at a fixed magnetic field $B$ assumed to be in the topological phase. It relies on the response of $G_{RL}$ to a local gate perturbation. The fundamental flaw is that it does not verify that the system has\nundergone a TPT to begin with. Without observing the characteristic bulk gap closing and reopening, there is no evidence that the system is in a topological phase at all. Any observed zero-bias peak could be a trivial ABS, and any observed nonlocal fluctuations could arise from mundane crosstalk or other classical effects. This protocol fails to establish the necessary prerequisite for MZM existence.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\nBased on a rigorous analysis of the underlying physics and the provided principles, Option A describes the most complete and discriminating protocol. It directly measures the defining feature of the topological phase transition—the closing and reopening of the bulk gap—using nonlocal spectroscopy and correlates it with the appearance of the end modes.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2869436"}]}
