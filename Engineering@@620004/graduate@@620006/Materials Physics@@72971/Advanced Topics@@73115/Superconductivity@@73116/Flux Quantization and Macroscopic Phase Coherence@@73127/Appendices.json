Here, $n_s^*(\\mathbf{r})$ is the number density of the superconducting charge carriers, which are Cooper pairs, and $\\theta(\\mathbf{r})$ represents the coherent phase of the condensate. The charge of a Cooper pair is $q^* = 2e$.\n\nThe resulting electrical supercurrent density, $\\mathbf{J}_s$, is described by the London equation:\n$$ \\mathbf{J}_s = \\frac{n_s^* q^*}{m^*} (\\hbar \\nabla\\theta - q^* \\mathbf{A}) $$\nThis equation connects the supercurrent density to the macroscopic properties of the condensate (phase gradient $\\nabla\\theta$) and the electromagnetic field (vector potential $\\mathbf{A}$).\n\nThe problem specifies a thick-walled superconducting ring. This allows for the selection of a closed integration contour, denoted as $C$, that lies deep within the superconducting material, where the cross-sectional dimensions are much larger than the London penetration depth. Due to the Meissner effect, the magnetic field $\\mathbf{B}$ is expelled from the bulk of the superconductor. Consequently, deep inside the material, far from any surfaces, any screening supercurrents have decayed to zero. Therefore, along this specific contour $C$, the supercurrent density $\\mathbf{J}_s$ is zero. Setting $\\mathbf{J}_s = 0$ in the equation above gives:\n$$ \\hbar \\nabla\\theta - q^* \\mathbf{A} = 0 $$\n$$ \\implies \\nabla\\theta = \\frac{q^*}{\\hbar} \\mathbf{A} $$\nWe now integrate this equation along the closed contour $C$ that encircles the hole of the ring:\n$$ \\oint_C \\nabla\\theta \\cdot d\\mathbf{l} = \\oint_C \\frac{q^*}{\\hbar} \\mathbf{A} \\cdot d\\mathbf{l} $$\n\nThe left-hand side of this equation is the total change in the phase, $\\Delta\\theta$, after one full traversal of the loop. A fundamental requirement for the order parameter $\\Psi(\\mathbf{r})$ is that it must be single-valued at every point in space. This means that after completing a closed loop, the phase $\\theta$ can only change by an integer multiple of $2\\pi$:\n$$ \\oint_C \\nabla\\theta \\cdot d\\mathbf{l} = \\Delta\\theta = 2\\pi n, \\quad \\text{where } n \\in \\mathbb{Z} $$\n\nThe right-hand side of the integrated equation involves the line integral of the vector potential $\\mathbf{A}$.

We also use the definition of the Planck constant, $h = 2\\pi\\hbar$. Substituting these values gives the final quantization condition:\n$$ \\Phi = n \\left( \\frac{h}{2e} \\right) $$\nThis result demonstrates that the magnetic flux linked by a superconducting ring is not continuous but is quantized in integer multiples of a fundamental unit.

A SQUID is fundamentally a magnetometer built around a superconducting loop containing one or more Josephson junctions. The total magnetic flux threading the loop must always be an integer multiple of $\\Phi_0$. This total flux is the sum of any externally applied flux $\\Phi_{ext}$ and the flux generated by an induced screening supercurrent $I_s$ in the loop itself. This quantum constraint means that the screening current $I_s$, and consequently the voltage and critical current of the SQUID, must respond to the external flux in a periodic manner. The period of this response is precisely one flux quantum, $\\Phi_0$. This periodic dependence allows for the measurement of extremely small changes in magnetic flux, often a tiny fraction of $\\Phi_0$, making SQUIDs the most sensitive magnetometers currently available.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{2.067834 \\times 10^{-15}}$$", "id": "2824081"}, {"introduction": "Building upon the principle of flux quantization, this exercise explores the energetic consequences for a superconducting ring threaded by an external magnetic flux, $\\Phi$.
