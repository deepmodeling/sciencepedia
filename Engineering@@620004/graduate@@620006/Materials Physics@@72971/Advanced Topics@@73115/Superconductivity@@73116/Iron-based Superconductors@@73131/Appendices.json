For iron-based superconductors, the precise arrangement of atoms in the crystal lattice, particularly the layered FeAs motifs, governs the electronic band structure from which complex phenomena emerge.

By interpreting the systematic absences of Bragg reflections observed in an X-ray experiment, you will determine the Bravais lattice and space group of the parent compound $\\mathrm{BaFe_2As_2}$, a crucial first step in building any realistic model of its properties [@problem_id:2996893].", "problem": "An iron pnictide of the 122 family, barium iron arsenide $\\mathrm{BaFe_2As_2}$, exhibits a high-temperature tetragonal phase that serves as the structural parent for superconductivity upon chemical substitution or pressure. In an X-ray diffraction (XRD, X-ray Diffraction) experiment at room temperature, the following systematic absences are observed in the Bragg reflection intensities indexed by Miller indices $(h,k,l)$ in the conventional tetragonal setting:\n- Reflections with $h+k+l$ odd are absent.\n- Reflections of the form $00l$ with odd $l$ are absent.\n- The lattice metric satisfies $a=b$ with $c\\neq a$.\n\nAssume the crystal is centrosymmetric and that the arsenic atoms lie on a site with one variable fractional coordinate $z_{\\mathrm{As}}$ along the $c$ axis, consistent with the layered motif of $\\mathrm{FeAs}$ tetrahedra separated by $\\mathrm{Ba}$ planes.

The solution proceeds by systematically addressing each of the five parts of the problem.\n\n1.  Determination of the Bravais lattice type, encoded by the integer $L$.\nThe foremost piece of information for determining the lattice type is the general condition on systematic absences of Bragg reflections. The problem states that reflections with Miller indices $(h,k,l)$ are absent if the sum $h+k+l$ is odd. This condition can be written mathematically as: reflections are observed only if $h+k+l=2n$ for some integer $n$. This is the defining reflection condition for a body-centered lattice, denoted by the letter $I$. In a tetragonal crystal system, this corresponds to the body-centered tetragonal Bravais lattice.\nThe problem provides a coding scheme: $L=1$ for primitive tetragonal ($P$) and $L=2$ for body-centered tetragonal ($I$). Since the observed extinctions uniquely identify an $I$-lattice, the value of $L$ must be $2$.\n\n2.  Determination of the space group number, $S$.\nThe determination of the space group requires combining the information about the Bravais lattice, the crystal system, and the point group symmetry.\n-   **Lattice Type**: As determined above, the lattice is body-centered ($I$).\n-   **Crystal System**: The problem states the phase is tetragonal, with lattice metric $a=b \\neq c$.\n-   **Point Group**: The problem states the crystal is centrosymmetric, meaning its point group must possess an inversion center. For the tetragonal system, the centrosymmetric point groups (Laue classes) are $4/m$ and $4/mmm$. The problem provides an additional constraint that there is a \"mirror-symmetric stacking of $\\mathrm{FeAs}$ layers and $\\mathrm{Ba}$ layers along $c$\". This implies the existence of a mirror plane perpendicular to the $c$-axis (the $xy$-plane at $z=0$ or $z=1/2$). The presence of both an inversion center and a mirror plane perpendicular to the four-fold axis indicates the highest-symmetry point group, $4/mmm$.\nCombining the lattice symbol $I$ with the point group symbol $4/mmm$ yields the space group $I4/mmm$. Consulting the International Tables for Crystallography (ITC), the space group $I4/mmm$ is assigned the number $139$.\nThe problem also provides a second extinction rule: reflections of the form $(0,0,l)$ with odd $l$ are absent. This rule is a special case of the body-centering condition $h+k+l=2n$. For a $(0,0,l)$ reflection, this condition becomes $0+0+l = l = 2n$, meaning $l$ must be even. Thus, the second rule is redundant but consistent with the first, confirming the assignment.\nTherefore, the space group number is $S=139$.\n\n3.  Computation of the number of iron ($\\mathrm{Fe}$) atoms per primitive cell, $N$.\nThe chemical formula is $\\mathrm{BaFe_2As_2}$. The crystal structure corresponding to this formula in the space group $I4/mmm$ is the $\\mathrm{ThCr_2Si_2}$-type structure. In this structure, the atoms are located at specific Wyckoff positions within the conventional unit cell. The standard assignment is:\n-   $\\mathrm{Ba}$ at Wyckoff position $2a$: $(0,0,0)$\n-   $\\mathrm{Fe}$ at Wyckoff position $4d$: $(0,1/2,1/4)$, $(1/2,0,1/4)$\n-   $\\mathrm{As}$ at Wyckoff position $4e$: $(0,0,z)$\nThe multiplicity of a Wyckoff position indicates the number of equivalent atoms of that type within the conventional unit cell.\n-   Number of $\\mathrm{Ba}$ atoms per conventional cell = $2$.\n-   Number of $\\mathrm{Fe}$ atoms per conventional cell = $4$.\n-   Number of $\\mathrm{As}$ atoms per conventional cell = $4$.\nThe ratio $2:4:4$ simplifies to $1:2:2$, which is consistent with the chemical formula $\\mathrm{BaFe_2As_2}$. This confirms there are $Z=2$ formula units per conventional cell.\nThe problem asks for the number of iron atoms, $N$, per *primitive* cell. A body-centered ($I$) conventional cell contains $2$ lattice points, and its volume is twice that of the primitive cell. Therefore, the number of atoms in the conventional cell is twice the number in the primitive cell.\nLet $N_{\\mathrm{conv,Fe}}$ be the number of Fe atoms in the conventional cell, and $N$ be the number in the primitive cell. Then $N_{\\mathrm{conv,Fe}} = 2 \\times N$. We found $N_{\\mathrm{conv,Fe}}=4$.\n$4 = 2 \\times N \\Rightarrow N = 2$.\nSo, there are $2$ iron atoms per primitive cell.\n\n4.  Identification of the fractional $z$-coordinates $z_{\\mathrm{Fe},1}$ and $z_{\\mathrm{Fe},2}$ of the iron layers.\nThe iron atoms occupy the Wyckoff position $4d$ of space group $I4/mmm$. The full set of coordinates for this position within the conventional cell is generated by applying the symmetry operations to the representative coordinates. The resulting positions are: $(0, 1/2, 1/4)$, $(1/2, 0, 1/4)$, $(0, 1/2, 3/4)$, and $(1/2, 0, 3/4)$.\nThese coordinates show that the iron atoms form two distinct layers perpendicular to the $c$-axis.\n-   One layer is at the fractional height $z = 1/4$, containing the atoms at $(0, 1/2, 1/4)$ and $(1/2, 0, 1/4)$.\n-   The other layer is at the fractional height $z = 3/4$, containing the atoms at $(0, 1/2, 3/4)$ and $(1/2, 0, 3/4)$.\nThus, the fractional $z$-coordinates of the two iron layers are $z_{\\mathrm{Fe},1} = 1/4$ and $z_{\\mathrm{Fe},2} = 3/4$.\n\n5.  Expression for the signed fractional vertical separation $\\Delta z$.\nThe problem asks for the signed fractional vertical separation $\\Delta z$ between the iron layer at $z=1/4$ and the nearest arsenic plane at $z=z_{\\mathrm{As}}$. The arsenic atoms occupy the $4e$ Wyckoff position, which has coordinates $(0,0,z_{\\mathrm{As}}), (0,0,-z_{\\mathrm{As}})$, plus their body-centered equivalents. The parameter $z_{\\mathrm{As}}$ is a free variable not fixed by symmetry, and must be determined experimentally.\nThe problem defines the required quantity as $\\Delta z = z_{\\mathrm{As}} - \\frac{1}{4}$ and specifies that $\\Delta z$ is positive if $z_{\\mathrm{As}} > 1/4$. Since no information is provided to determine the numerical value of $z_{\\mathrm{As}}$, the expression for $\\Delta z$ must remain in terms of this symbolic parameter. The task is simply to state this relationship. Therefore, the expression for the separation is $\\Delta z = z_{\\mathrm{As}} - \\frac{1}{4}$.\n\nThe final answer is a row matrix containing the values for $L$, $S$, $N$, $z_{\\mathrm{Fe},1}$, $z_{\\mathrm{Fe},2}$, and $\\Delta z$.\n$L=2$\n$S=139$\n$N=2$\n$z_{\\mathrm{Fe},1}=1/4$\n$z_{\\mathrm{Fe},2}=3/4$\n$\\Delta z = z_{\\mathrm{As}} - 1/4$", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n2 & 139 & 2 & \\frac{1}{4} & \\frac{3}{4} & z_{\\mathrm{As}} - \\frac{1}{4}\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "2996893"}, {"introduction": "Once the crystal lattice is known, the next step is to map the electronic landscape.

It requires the application of fundamental principles of solid-state physics to a realistic scenario. We shall proceed with the derivation and calculation.\n\n(a) Derivation of the expression for net carrier doping per iron atom.\n\nThe foundation of this analysis is Luttinger's theorem, which relates the volume enclosed by a Fermi surface to the number of charge carriers. For a multi-band system with both electron and hole pockets, the theorem is applied to each type of carrier.\n\nLet $\\mathcal{V}_e$ and $\\mathcal{V}_h$ be the total volume fractions of the electron and hole Fermi surfaces, respectively, relative to the volume of the reference Brillouin zone. The problem specifies the two-iron ($2$-$\\text{Fe}$) Brillouin zone, so all quantities are referenced to it. The number of electrons ($n_e$) and holes ($n_h$) **per unit cell** are given by:\n$$n_e = g_s \\mathcal{V}_e$$\n$$n_h = g_s \\mathcal{V}_h$$\nwhere $g_s$ is the spin degeneracy factor. The problem states to assume $g_s=2$.\n\nThese relations follow from the fact that the density of states in $k$-space is uniform, with each state occupying a volume of $\\frac{(2\\pi)^3}{V_{crystal}}$, where $V_{crystal}$ is the crystal volume. The total number of available states in a Brillouin zone of volume $V_{BZ}$ is $g_s \\frac{V_{BZ}}{(2\\pi)^3/V_{crystal}}$. Therefore, the number of carriers per unit cell is $g_s$ times the fraction of the Brillouin zone volume occupied by those carriers.\n\nThe problem provides $k_z$-averaged Fermi surface *area* fractions, denoted $a_i$. It states that these are \"averaged uniformly over $k_z$ across the full Brillouin zone height\". This is a crucial simplification, as it implies that the $3D$ volume fraction of a pocket, $\\mathcal{V}_i$, is numerically equal to its specified $k_z$-averaged $2D$ area fraction, $a_i$. That is, $\\mathcal{V}_i = a_i$.\n\nThe net carrier doping per unit cell, $\\delta n_{cell}$, is defined as the excess of electrons over holes. A positive value signifies electron doping, and a negative value signifies hole doping.\n$$\\delta n_{cell} = n_e - n_h = g_s (\\mathcal{V}_e - \\mathcal{V}_h)$$\nHere, $\\mathcal{V}_e$ is the total fractional volume of all electron pockets and $\\mathcal{V}_h$ is the total fractional volume of all hole pockets within the $2$-$\\text{Fe}$ Brillouin zone.\n\nThe problem requires the net carrier doping **per iron atom**, $\\delta n_{\\text{Fe}}$. The $122$ iron pnictide crystallographic unit cell, which corresponds to the $2$-$\\text{Fe}$ Brillouin zone, contains $N_{\\text{Fe}} = 2$ iron atoms. Therefore, we must normalize the doping per unit cell by this number:\n$$\\delta n_{\\text{Fe}} = \\frac{\\delta n_{cell}}{N_{\\text{Fe}}} = \\frac{g_s (\\mathcal{V}_e - \\mathcal{V}_h)}{N_{\\text{Fe}}}$$\nSubstituting the known values $g_s=2$ and $N_{\\text{Fe}}=2$, we find a remarkable simplification:\n$$\\delta n_{\\text{Fe}} = \\frac{2 (\\mathcal{V}_e - \\mathcal{V}_h)}{2} = \\mathcal{V}_e - \\mathcal{V}_h$$\nThis is the required expression. It states that the net doping per iron atom is simply the difference between the total electron and hole Fermi surface volume fractions in the $2$-$\\text{Fe}$ Brillouin zone. The Fermi velocities $v_{F}$ are related to the electronic band dispersion $\\frac{\\partial E}{\\partial k}$ at the Fermi level and determine kinetic and transport properties, but they do not enter into the carrier counting dictated by Luttinger's theorem.\n\n(b) Evaluation of carrier doping and charge compensation.\n\nWe now apply the derived formula to the experimental data. First, we must calculate the total volume fractions $\\mathcal{V}_h$ and $\\mathcal{V}_e$.\n\nThe hole pockets are located at the zone center, $\\Gamma$. There is one $\\Gamma$ point per Brillouin zone. The total hole volume fraction is the sum of the fractions of the three distinct hole pockets:\n$$\\mathcal{V}_h = a_{h1} + a_{h2} + a_{h3} = 0.040 + 0.070 + 0.030 = 0.140$$\n\nThe electron pockets are located at the zone corners. The problem states there are two symmetry-equivalent zone corners in the $2$-$\\text{Fe}$ BZ, and at each corner, there are two distinct electron pockets. The given area fractions $a_{e1}$ and $a_{e2}$ are per corner. Thus, to find the total electron volume fraction, we must sum the contributions from both corners:\n$$\\mathcal{V}_e = N_{corners} \\times (a_{e1} + a_{e2}) = 2 \\times (0.050 + 0.030) = 2 \\times 0.080 = 0.160$$\n\nNow, we calculate the net carrier doping per iron atom:\n$$\\delta n_{\\text{Fe}} = \\mathcal{V}_e - \\mathcal{V}_h = 0.160 - 0.140 = 0.020$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to three significant figures. The calculated value $0.020$ has two significant figures. To express this with three significant figures, we write it as $0.0200$.\n\nThe positive sign of $\\delta n_{\\text{Fe}}$ indicates a net excess of electrons, meaning the material is slightly electron-doped.\n\nFinally, we must assess if the material is charge compensated. The condition for compensation is given as $|\\delta n_{\\text{Fe}}| \\le 0.010$.\nOur result is $|\\delta n_{\\text{Fe}}| = |0.0200| = 0.0200$.\nSince $0.0200 > 0.010$, the condition is not met. Therefore, the material is **not** charge compensated within the specified tolerance of $\\pm 0.010$ carriers per iron atom.

In many unconventional systems, including the iron-based superconductors, this gap can vary significantly across the Fermi surface, and its structure holds vital clues about the underlying pairing mechanism. This problem delves into the symmetry properties of the superconducting gap, distinguishing between nodes (points where the gap vanishes) that are enforced by symmetry and those that appear \"accidentally\" due to the specific details of the pairing interaction. By analyzing a phenomenological gap function for the fully symmetric $A_{1g}$ channel, you will learn to derive the precise conditions under which accidental nodes can appear, a critical skill for interpreting modern experiments that probe the momentum-space structure of the superconducting state [@problem_id:2831451].", "problem": "In iron-based superconductors with tetragonal point group symmetry $D_{4h}$, spin-singlet pairing in the fully symmetric $A_{1g}$ representation admits an $s$-wave gap that can be anisotropic on the electron Fermi surface pockets centered near $(\\pi,0)$ and $(0,\\pi)$ in the unfolded Brillouin zone.

It presents a standard phenomenological model for an anisotropic superconducting gap in a system with tetragonal symmetry and asks for a rigorous derivation of the conditions for and locations of gap nodes. The tasks are unambiguous and solvable using established principles. Therefore, a solution will be provided.\n\nThe analysis is organized into three parts as requested.\n\nFirst, we address the nature of nodes in a fully gapped $A_{1g}$ superconducting state. A symmetry-enforced node is a point or line in momentum space where the superconducting gap function $\\Delta(\\mathbf{k})$ is required to be zero by the transformation properties of the irreducible representation (irrep) to which the pairing state belongs. For example, irreps that are odd under certain crystal symmetry operations, such as the $B_{1g}$ or $B_{2g}$ representations in the $D_{4h}$ point group, will have basis functions like $\\cos(k_x a) - \\cos(k_y a)$ or $\\sin(k_x a)\\sin(k_y a)$, which must vanish along high-symmetry lines like $k_x = \\pm k_y$ or $k_x=0$, respectively.\n\nThe $A_{1g}$ irrep is the fully symmetric representation. Its basis functions are invariant under all symmetry operations of the point group. The simplest basis function is a constant, which corresponds to an isotropic, nodeless $s$-wave gap. More generally, any function that is invariant under the $D_{4h}$ group operations, such as the given form $\\Delta_{e}(\\theta)=\\Delta_{s}+\\Delta_{2}\\cos(2\\theta)+\\Delta_{4}\\cos(4\\theta)$, transforms as $A_{1g}$. In this expression, which is an expansion in angular harmonics for a Fermi surface with effective $D_{4h}$ symmetry, each term is individually invariant under the symmetry operations. Because no symmetry operation forces a sign change on the total gap function, $\\Delta_{e}(\\theta)$ is not required to be zero at any specific angle $\\theta$. A node can only appear if the parameters $\\Delta_{s}$, $\\Delta_{2}$, and $\\Delta_{4}$, which are determined by the microscopic details of the material and not by symmetry, happen to take values that cause the sum to be zero at some angle. Such nodes are therefore termed \"accidental.\"\n\nSecond, we derive the necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of such accidental nodes. A node exists if there is a real angle $\\theta$ for which $\\Delta_{e}(\\theta)=0$.\n$$\n\\Delta_{s}+\\Delta_{2}\\cos(2\\theta)+\\Delta_{4}\\cos(4\\theta) = 0\n$$\nTo solve this trigonometric equation, we employ the double-angle identity $\\cos(4\\theta) = 2\\cos^{2}(2\\theta) - 1$. Let the variable $x = \\cos(2\\theta)$. The equation becomes:\n$$\n\\Delta_{s}+\\Delta_{2}x+\\Delta_{4}(2x^{2}-1) = 0\n$$\nThis is a quadratic equation in $x$:\n$$\n(2\\Delta_{4})x^2 + \\Delta_{2}x + (\\Delta_{s} - \\Delta_{4}) = 0\n$$\nSince the problem specifies that $\\Delta_4 \\neq 0$, this is a proper quadratic equation. For a node to exist at a real angle $\\theta$, there must be a real solution for $x$ in the physically allowed domain for a cosine function, which is $x \\in [-1, 1]$. Therefore, the necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of accidental nodes is that the quadratic equation $(2\\Delta_{4})x^2 + \\Delta_{2}x + (\\Delta_{s} - \\Delta_{4}) = 0$ must possess at least one real root $x$ such that $|x| \\le 1$. This encapsulates two sub-conditions: the discriminant must be non-negative to ensure real roots for $x$, and at least one of these roots must lie within the interval $[-1, 1]$.\n\nThird, we solve for the nodal angles explicitly. The solutions to the quadratic equation for $x = \\cos(2\\theta)$ are given by the quadratic formula:\n$$\nx = \\frac{-\\Delta_{2} \\pm \\sqrt{\\Delta_{2}^{2} - 4(2\\Delta_{4})(\\Delta_{s} - \\Delta_{4})}}{4\\Delta_{4}}\n$$\nLet us denote the two possible values for $x$ as $C_{\\pm}$:\n$$\nC_{\\pm} = \\frac{-\\Delta_{2} \\pm \\sqrt{\\Delta_{2}^{2} - 8\\Delta_{4}\\Delta_{s} + 8\\Delta_{4}^{2}}}{4\\Delta_{4}}\n$$\nFor each value $C_k$ (where $k$ is $+$ or $-$) that is a valid cosine (i.e., $|C_k| \\le 1$), we must solve $\\cos(2\\theta) = C_k$. The principal value solution for $2\\theta$ is $\\arccos(C_k)$, which lies in the interval $[0, \\pi]$. Let us define $\\alpha_k = \\arccos(C_k)$. The general solutions for $2\\theta$ are given by $2\\theta = \\pm \\alpha_k + 2\\pi n$ for integer $n$. To find all unique solutions for $\\theta$ in the principal interval $0 \\le \\theta < 2\\pi$, we find:\nFrom $2\\theta = \\alpha_k + 2\\pi n$, we get $\\theta = \\frac{1}{2}\\alpha_k$ and $\\theta = \\frac{1}{2}\\alpha_k + \\pi$.\nFrom $2\\theta = -\\alpha_k + 2\\pi n$, we get $\\theta = \\pi - \\frac{1}{2}\\alpha_k$ and $\\theta = 2\\pi - \\frac{1}{2}\\alpha_k$.\nThus, for each valid solution $C_k$, there can be up to four distinct nodal angles in $[0, 2\\pi)$. The complete set of potential nodal angles is generated from both $C_+$ and $C_-$. The existence of real solutions for $\\theta$ is implicitly encoded by the domain of the $\\arccos$ function; if its argument is outside $[-1, 1]$, the resulting angle is not real, and no physical node corresponds to that solution. The final answer comprises up to eight potential angles, presented as a single row matrix.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n\\frac{1}{2}\\arccos\\left(\\frac{-\\Delta_{2} + \\sqrt{\\Delta_{2}^{2} - 8\\Delta_{4}(\\Delta_{s} - \\Delta_{4})}}{4\\Delta_{4}}\\right) & \\pi - \\frac{1}{2}\\arccos\\left(\\frac{-\\Delta_{2} + \\sqrt{\\Delta_{2}^{2} - 8\\Delta_{4}(\\Delta_{s} - \\Delta_{4})}}{4\\Delta_{4}}\\right) & \\pi + \\frac{1}{2}\\arccos\\left(\\frac{-\\Delta_{2} + \\sqrt{\\Delta_{2}^{2} - 8\\Delta_{4}(\\Delta_{s} - \\Delta_{4})}}{4\\Delta_{4}}\\right) & 2\\pi - \\frac{1}{2}\\arccos\\left(\\frac{-\\Delta_{2} + \\sqrt{\\Delta_{2}^{2} - 8\\Delta_{4}(\\Delta_{s} - \\Delta_{4})}}{4\\Delta_{4}}\\right) & \\frac{1}{2}\\arccos\\left(\\frac{-\\Delta_{2} - \\sqrt{\\Delta_{2}^{2} - 8\\Delta_{4}(\\Delta_{s} - \\Delta_{4})}}{4\\Delta_{4}}\\right) & \\pi - \\frac{1}{2}\\arccos\\left(\\frac{-\\Delta_{2} - \\sqrt{\\Delta_{2}^{2} - 8\\Delta_{4}(\\Delta_{s} - \\Delta_{4})}}{4\\Delta_{4}}\\right) & \\pi + \\frac{1}{2}\\arccos\\left(\\frac{-\\Delta_{2} - \\sqrt{\\Delta_{2}^{2} - 8\\Delta_{4}(\\Delta_{s} - \\Delta_{4})}}{4\\Delta_{4}}\\right) & 2\\pi - \\frac{1}{2}\\arccos\\left(\\frac{-\\Delta_{2} - \\sqrt{\\Delta_{2}^{2} - 8\\Delta_{4}(\\Delta_{s} - \\Delta_{4})}}{4\\Delta_{4}}\\right)\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "2831451"}]}
