The problem states that we should employ the weak-coupling approximation, which is valid when $\\hbar\\omega_D \\gg \\Delta_0$. In this limit, the argument of the $\\arcsinh$ function is large.

The problem posed is a standard exercise in the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) theory of superconductivity. It is physically well-grounded, mathematically well-posed, and free of any inconsistencies. The problem is evaluated as valid, and we may proceed with its solution.\n\nThe superfluid density $n_s(T)$ is defined via the London relation for the total electronic current density $\\mathbf{j}$ in response to a weak, static, and uniform vector potential $\\mathbf{A}$:\n$$\n\\mathbf{j} = - \\frac{e^{2}}{m}\\, n_{s}(T)\\, \\mathbf{A}\n$$\nHere, $e$ is the elementary charge and $m$ is the electron band mass.\n\nIn a microscopic theory, the total current density operator is composed of a paramagnetic part $\\hat{\\mathbf{j}}_p$ and a diamagnetic part $\\hat{\\mathbf{j}}_d$. For a uniform vector potential, the expectation value of the current density is given by linear response theory as:\n$$\n\\mathbf{j} = \\mathbf{j}_p + \\mathbf{j}_d = \\mathbf{j}_p - \\frac{e^2 n}{m} \\mathbf{A}\n$$\nwhere $n$ is the total density of electrons. The paramagnetic current $\\mathbf{j}_p$ is the response of the system to the perturbation Hamiltonian $H' = - \\int \\hat{\\mathbf{j}}_p \\cdot \\mathbf{A} \\, d^3r$. For an isotropic system, this response is parallel to $\\mathbf{A}$, and can be written as $\\mathbf{j}_p = K_p(T) \\mathbf{A}$, where $K_p(T)$ is the static, long-wavelength limit of the paramagnetic response kernel.\n\nComparing the two expressions for the total current, we find the relation between the superfluid density and the paramagnetic response:\n$$\n- \\frac{e^{2} n_{s}(T)}{m} = K_p(T) - \\frac{e^2 n}{m} \\implies n_s(T) = n - \\frac{m}{e^2} K_p(T)\n$$\nIn BCS theory, at zero temperature ($T=0$), the ground state is rigid with respect to a static, uniform perturbation due to the existence of the energy gap $\\Delta_0$. Consequently, the paramagnetic current is zero, $K_p(0)=0$, which implies that the superfluid density is equal to the total electron density, $n_s(0) = n$.\n\nFor finite temperatures ($T0$), quasiparticles are thermally excited above the gap. These quasiparticles behave as normal electrons and can be accelerated by an external field, giving rise to a non-zero paramagnetic current. The density of these normal fluid carriers, $n_n(T)$, is responsible for the paramagnetic response. The superfluid density is then $n_s(T) = n - n_n(T)$.\n\nWithin the BCS mean-field framework, the fraction of normal fluid electrons is given by an integral over all electronic states, weighted by a thermal response function. For an isotropic three-dimensional system, this is expressed as:\n$$\n\\frac{n_n(T)}{n} = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\left(-\\frac{\\partial f(E)}{\\partial E}\\right) d\\xi\n$$\nHere, $\\xi_{\\mathbf{k}} = \\frac{\\hbar^2 k^2}{2m} - E_F$ is the single-particle energy relative to the Fermi energy $E_F$, $f(E) = (1 + \\exp(E/k_B T))^{-1}$ is the Fermi-Dirac distribution, and $E = \\sqrt{\\xi^2 + \\Delta(T)^2}$ is the energy of a Bogoliubov quasiparticle with energy gap $\\Delta(T)$. The integral is over the density of states, which is assumed to be constant near the Fermi surface.\n\nThe normalized superfluid density is therefore:\n$$\n\\frac{n_s(T)}{n_s(0)} = \\frac{n_s(T)}{n} = 1 - \\frac{n_n(T)}{n} = 1 - \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\left(-\\frac{\\partial f(E)}{\\partial E}\\right) d\\xi\n$$\nTo fulfill the first part of the problem, we must convert this into a single integral over the quasiparticle energy $E$. The integral is symmetric with respect to $\\xi=0$, so we can write:\n$$\n\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} d\\xi \\dots = 2 \\int_{0}^{\\infty} d\\xi \\dots\n$$\nWe change the integration variable from $\\xi$ to $E$ for $\\xi \\ge 0$. The relation is $\\xi = \\sqrt{E^2 - \\Delta(T)^2}$, which gives $d\\xi = \\frac{E}{\\sqrt{E^2 - \\Delta(T)^2}} dE$. The integration limits change from $\\xi \\in [0, \\infty)$ to $E \\in [\\Delta(T), \\infty)$.\nSubstituting this into our expression yields the desired integral form:\n$$\n\\frac{n_s(T)}{n_s(0)} = 1 - 2 \\int_{\\Delta(T)}^{\\infty} \\left(-\\frac{\\partial f(E)}{\\partial E}\\right) \\frac{E}{\\sqrt{E^2 - \\Delta(T)^2}} dE\n$$\nThis expression can be written as $1 + 2 \\int_{\\Delta(T)}^{\\infty} \\frac{\\partial f(E)}{\\partial E} \\frac{E}{\\sqrt{E^2 - \\Delta(T)^2}} dE$, which is a standard result in the theory of superconductivity.\n\nNow, we proceed to the second part of the problem: the asymptotic behavior in the low-temperature limit, $T \\ll T_c$. In this regime, the temperature is much smaller than the critical temperature $T_c$, and the energy gap is very close to its zero-temperature value, $\\Delta(T) \\approx \\Delta_0$. The thermal energy $k_B T$ is much smaller than the gap, $k_B T \\ll \\Delta_0$.\n\nThe term $-\\frac{\\partial f(E)}{\\partial E}$ in the integrand is:\n$$\n-\\frac{\\partial f(E)}{\\partial E} = \\frac{1}{k_B T} \\frac{\\exp(E/k_B T)}{(\\exp(E/k_B T) + 1)^2}\n$$\nSince the integration range is $E \\ge \\Delta_0$ and $\\Delta_0 \\gg k_B T$, we have $\\exp(E/k_B T) \\gg 1$. We can therefore approximate the denominator:\n$$\n-\\frac{\\partial f(E)}{\\partial E} \\approx \\frac{1}{k_B T} \\frac{\\exp(E/k_B T)}{(\\exp(E/k_B T))^2} = \\frac{1}{k_B T} \\exp(-E/k_B T)\n$$\nThe normal fluid fraction $n_n(T)/n$ becomes:\n$$\n\\frac{n_n(T)}{n} \\approx \\frac{2}{k_B T} \\int_{\\Delta_0}^{\\infty} \\frac{E \\exp(-E/k_B T)}{\\sqrt{E^2-\\Delta_0^2}} dE\n$$\nThe exponential factor $\\exp(-E/k_B T)$ decays rapidly, so the dominant contribution to the integral comes from energies $E$ close to $\\Delta_0$.

Let this be $a+ib$. Our convention $\\Im(\\Omega)0$ implies that for $E0$, both $\\Re(\\Omega)$ and $\\Im(\\Omega)$ must be positive. This corresponds to $a0$ and $b0$.\n$$ (a+ib)^2 = a^{2}-b^{2}+2iab = -1+2ir $$\nEquating real and imaginary parts:\n$$ a^{2}-b^{2} = -1 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad 2ab = 2r \\implies ab=r $$\nSubstituting $b=r/a$ into the first equation:\n$$ a^{2} - \\frac{r^{2}}{a^{2}} = -1 \\implies a^{4} + a^{2} - r^{2} = 0 $$\nSolving the quadratic equation for $a^{2}$:\n$$ a^{2} = \\frac{-1 \\pm \\sqrt{1-4(1)(-r^{2})}}{2} = \\frac{-1 \\pm \\sqrt{1+4r^{2}}}{2} $$\nSince $a$ is real, $a^{2}$ must be positive. We take the positive root:\n$$ a^{2} = \\frac{\\sqrt{1+4r^{2}}-1}{2} \\implies a = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\sqrt{1+4r^{2}}-1}{2}} $$\nAlso, $b^{2} = a^{2}+1$:\n$$ b^{2} = \\frac{\\sqrt{1+4r^{2}}+1}{2} \\implies b = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\sqrt{1+4r^{2}}+1}{2}} $$\nNow we evaluate the real part of $\\frac{r+i}{a+ib}$:\n$$ \\Re\\left(\\frac{(r+i)(a-ib)}{a^{2}+b^{2}}\\right) = \\frac{ra+b}{a^{2}+b^{2}} $$\nThe denominator is $a^{2}+b^{2} = \\frac{\\sqrt{1+4r^{2}}-1}{2} + \\frac{\\sqrt{1+4r^{2}}+1}{2} = \\sqrt{1+4r^{2}}$.\nSo, we have:\n$$ \\frac{N_{s}(\\Delta,\\Gamma)}{N_{0}} = \\frac{ra+b}{\\sqrt{1+4r^{2}}} = \\frac{r\\sqrt{\\frac{\\sqrt{1+4r^{2}}-1}{2}} + \\sqrt{\\frac{\\sqrt{1+4r^{2}}+1}{2}}}{\\sqrt{1+4r^{2}}} $$\nSubstituting $r=15$:\n$$ \\sqrt{1+4(15)^{2}} = \\sqrt{1+4(225)} = \\sqrt{901} $$\nThe expression becomes:\n$$ \\frac{N_{s}}{N_{0}} = \\frac{15\\sqrt{\\frac{\\sqrt{901}-1}{2}} + \\sqrt{\\frac{\\sqrt{901}+1}{2}}}{\\sqrt{901}} $$\nNumerically:\n$$ \\sqrt{901} \\approx 30.016662 $$\n$$ a = \\sqrt{\\frac{30.016662-1}{2}} = \\sqrt{14.508331} \\approx 3.808980 $$\n$$ b = \\sqrt{\\frac{30.016662+1}{2}} = \\sqrt{15.508331} \\approx 3.938062 $$\nThe numerator is $15a+b \\approx 15(3.808980) + 3.938062 = 57.134700 + 3.938062 = 61.072762$.\nThe value is $\\frac{61.072762}{30.016662} \\approx 2.034615$.\nRounding to four significant figures gives $2.035$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{2.035}$$", "id": "2802562"}]}
