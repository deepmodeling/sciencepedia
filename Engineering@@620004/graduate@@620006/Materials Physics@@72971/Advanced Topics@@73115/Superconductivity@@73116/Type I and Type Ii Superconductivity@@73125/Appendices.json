The derivation must be based on fundamental principles of Ginzburg-Landau (GL) theory and London electrodynamics.\n\nThe state of a superconductor is described by a complex order parameter, $\\psi(\\mathbf{r})$, where $|\\psi(\\mathbf{r})|^2$ is proportional to the density of superconducting charge carriers (Cooper pairs). The behavior of $\\psi$ and the magnetic field is governed by the GL equations, which are derived from minimizing the GL free energy functional. Two fundamental length scales emerge from this theory: the coherence length $\\xi$, over which $\\psi$ can vary significantly, and the London penetration depth $\\lambda$, the characteristic length for the decay of magnetic fields inside the superconductor. Their ratio defines the Ginzburg-Landau parameter, $\\kappa = \\lambda/\\xi$.\n\nLet us begin with the upper critical induction, $\\mu_{0}H_{c2}$. This is the field at which superconductivity is destroyed by the external magnetic field, marking the transition from the mixed (vortex) state to the normal state. At this transition, the order parameter $\\psi$ is infinitesimally small. We can therefore use the linearized GL equation, which neglects higher-order terms in $\\psi$:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{2m^*} (-i\\hbar\\nabla - q\\mathbf{A})^2 \\psi = -\\alpha \\psi\n$$\nHere, $q=2e$ and $m^*=2m_e$ are the charge and effective mass of a Cooper pair, respectively, $\\mathbf{A}$ is the magnetic vector potential, and $\\alpha$ is a temperature-dependent GL coefficient. At $T=0$, $\\alpha$ is a negative constant. The coherence length $\\xi$ is defined by the relation $\\xi^2 = -\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2m^*\\alpha}$. Substituting this into the linearized GL equation gives:\n$$\n\\frac{-\\hbar^2}{2m^*\\xi^2} (-i\\nabla - \\frac{2e}{\\hbar}\\mathbf{A})^2 \\psi = \\psi\n$$\nThis equation is formally identical to the time-independent Schrödinger equation for a particle of charge $2e$ and mass $m^*$ in a uniform magnetic field $\\mathbf{B} = \\nabla \\times \\mathbf{A}$. The eigenvalues of the kinetic energy operator on the left-hand side are the Landau levels:\n$$\nE_n = (n + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega_c\n$$\nwhere $\\omega_c = \\frac{qB}{m^*} = \\frac{2eB}{m^*}$ is the cyclotron frequency. A non-trivial solution for $\\psi$ exists only if $-\\alpha$ is equal to one of these energy eigenvalues. To find the maximum possible field $B=B_{c2}=\\mu_0 H_{c2}$ that can sustain superconductivity, we must consider the lowest possible energy state, which corresponds to the ground state $n=0$.\n$$\n-\\alpha = E_0 = \\frac{1}{2}\\hbar\\omega_c = \\frac{1}{2}\\hbar\\frac{2eB_{c2}}{m^*} = \\frac{\\hbar e B_{c2}}{m^*}\n$$\nNow, we express $-\\alpha$ in terms of the coherence length $\\xi(0)$: $-\\alpha = \\frac{\\hbar^2}{2m^*\\xi(0)^2}$. Equating the two expressions for $-\\alpha$ yields:\n$$\n\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2m^*\\xi(0)^2} = \\frac{\\hbar e B_{c2}(0)}{m^*}\n$$\nSolving for $B_{c2}(0) = \\mu_0 H_{c2}(0)$, we get:\n$$\n\\mu_0 H_{c2}(0) = \\frac{\\hbar}{2e\\xi(0)^2}\n$$\nThe magnetic flux quantum is defined as $\\Phi_0 = h/(2e) = 2\\pi\\hbar/(2e)$. Therefore, $\\hbar/(2e) = \\Phi_0/(2\\pi)$. Substituting this, we arrive at the expression for the upper critical induction:\n$$\n\\mu_0 H_{c2}(0) = \\frac{\\Phi_0}{2\\pi\\xi(0)^2}\n$$\n\nNext, we derive the expression for the lower critical induction, $\\mu_{0}H_{c1}$. This is the field at which it first becomes energetically favorable for magnetic flux to penetrate the superconductor in the form of a quantized vortex line. Each vortex carries a single flux quantum, $\\Phi_0$. The condition for the entry of the first vortex is that the change in the Gibbs free energy per unit length, $\\Delta \\mathcal{G}$, upon creating the vortex is zero or negative.\n$$\n\\Delta \\mathcal{G} = \\epsilon_L - B \\cdot M_{Meissner} \\cdot (\\text{Area}) \\rightarrow \\Delta \\mathcal{G} = \\epsilon_L - \\Phi_0 H\n$$\nThe term $\\epsilon_L$ is the self-energy per unit length of the vortex line, representing the energy cost of its creation. The term $\\Phi_0 H$ represents the work done by the external field $H$ as one flux quantum $\\Phi_0$ enters the sample. At the critical field $H_{c1}$, this energy balance is at equilibrium, so $\\Delta \\mathcal{G} = 0$, which gives the relation:\n$$\n\\epsilon_L = \\Phi_0 H_{c1}\n$$\nThe line energy $\\epsilon_L$ arises from the kinetic energy of the circulating supercurrents and the energy of the trapped magnetic field. For a Type II superconductor with a large Ginzburg-Landau parameter ($\\kappa \\gg 1$), we can use London theory to estimate this energy. The energy per unit length stored in the magnetic field and supercurrents outside the vortex core (of radius $\\sim \\xi$) is found by integrating the energy density from $r=\\xi$ to $r=\\infty$. This gives the dominant, logarithmic term:\n$$\n\\epsilon_{L, \\text{outside}} \\approx \\frac{\\Phi_0^2}{4\\pi\\mu_0\\lambda^2} \\ln\\left(\\frac{\\lambda}{\\xi}\\right) = \\frac{\\Phi_0^2}{4\\pi\\mu_0\\lambda^2} \\ln(\\kappa)\n$$\nThe problem specifies using \"the standard core-energy correction\". The normal-state core of the vortex has an energy cost associated with the loss of condensation energy. This core energy contribution adds a constant term to the line energy expression. A widely accepted approximation for the total line energy for large $\\kappa$ is:\n$$\n\\epsilon_L \\approx \\frac{\\Phi_0^2}{4\\pi\\mu_0\\lambda^2} (\\ln\\kappa + C)\n$$\nwhere $C$ is a constant of order unity. We will use the standard value $C \\approx 0.5$.\nSubstituting this into our energy balance equation $\\Phi_0 H_{c1} = \\epsilon_L$, we find:\n$$\n\\Phi_0 H_{c1}(0) = \\frac{\\Phi_0^2}{4\\pi\\mu_0\\lambda(0)^2} (\\ln\\kappa + 0.5)\n$$\nSolving for the lower critical induction $B_{c1}(0) = \\mu_0 H_{c1}(0)$:\n$$\n\\mu_0 H_{c1}(0) = \\frac{\\Phi_0}{4\\pi\\lambda(0)^2} (\\ln\\kappa(0) + 0.5)\n$$\nwhere $\\kappa(0) = \\lambda(0)/\\xi(0)$.\n\nNow, we perform the numerical evaluation for the given material with $\\lambda(0) = 120\\,\\mathrm{nm}$ and $\\xi(0) = 10.0\\,\\mathrm{nm}$. We use the value $\\Phi_0 = 2.067833848 \\times 10^{-15}\\,\\mathrm{T\\cdot m^2}$.\n\nFirst, we calculate the Ginzburg-Landau parameter $\\kappa(0)$:\n$$\n\\kappa(0) = \\frac{\\lambda(0)}{\\xi(0)} = \\frac{120\\,\\mathrm{nm}}{10.0\\,\\mathrm{nm}} = 12.0\n$$\nThe type of superconductivity is determined by $\\kappa$. A superconductor is Type I if $\\kappa < 1/\\sqrt{2}$ and Type II if $\\kappa > 1/\\sqrt{2}$. Since $1/\\sqrt{2} \\approx 0.707$, our value of $\\kappa = 12.0$ indicates that the material is a Type II superconductor. Therefore, the parameter $n$ in the final answer is $n=2$.\n\nNext, we calculate the upper critical induction $\\mu_0 H_{c2}(0)$:\n$$\n\\mu_0 H_{c2}(0) = \\frac{\\Phi_0}{2\\pi\\xi(0)^2} = \\frac{2.067833848 \\times 10^{-15}\\,\\mathrm{T\\cdot m^2}}{2\\pi (10.0 \\times 10^{-9}\\,\\mathrm{m})^2} = \\frac{2.067833848 \\times 10^{-15}}{2\\pi \\times 1.00 \\times 10^{-16}}\\,\\mathrm{T}\n$$\n$$\n\\mu_0 H_{c2}(0) \\approx 3.29109\\,\\mathrm{T}\n$$\nRounding to four significant figures, we get $\\mu_0 H_{c2}(0) = 3.291\\,\\mathrm{T}$.\n\nFinally, we calculate the lower critical induction $\\mu_0 H_{c1}(0)$:\n$$\n\\mu_0 H_{c1}(0) = \\frac{\\Phi_0}{4\\pi\\lambda(0)^2} (\\ln(12.0) + 0.5)\n$$\nUsing $\\lambda(0) = 120 \\times 10^{-9}\\,\\mathrm{m}$ and $\\ln(12.0) \\approx 2.484907$:\n$$\n\\mu_0 H_{c1}(0) = \\frac{2.067833848 \\times 10^{-15}\\,\\mathrm{T\\cdot m^2}}{4\\pi (120 \\times 10^{-9}\\,\\mathrm{m})^2} (2.484907 + 0.5)\n$$\n$$\n\\mu_0 H_{c1}(0) = \\frac{2.067833848 \\times 10^{-15}}{4\\pi \\times 1.44 \\times 10^{-14}} (2.984907)\\,\\mathrm{T} \\approx 0.034109\\,\\mathrm{T}\n$$\nRounding to four significant figures, we get $\\mu_0 H_{c1}(0) = 0.03411\\,\\mathrm{T}$.\n\nThe final results are $\\mu_0 H_{c1}(0) = 0.03411\\,\\mathrm{T}$, $\\mu_0 H_{c2}(0) = 3.291\\,\\mathrm{T}$, and the material is Type II ($n=2$).", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 0.03411 & 3.291 & 2 \\end{pmatrix}}\n$$", "id": "2869191"}, {"introduction": "While Ginzburg-Landau theory provides a powerful phenomenological framework, the microscopic Werthamer–Helfand–Hohenberg (WHH) theory offers deep insights into the temperature dependence of the upper critical field, $H_{c2}(T)$.

The measurements are performed at fixed low temperature, in conditions where surface barriers and irreversible effects can be neglected, and the Meissner response is reversible until the onset of flux entry. The magnetic response is recorded as the magnetization $M$ versus the applied field $H_{\\mathrm{a}}$.

The intrinsic properties of the material are governed by $H_{\\mathrm{i}}$, while experiments measure the response to $H_{\\mathrm{a}}$. Let's analyze each statement based on this.\n\n1.  **Meissner State (Type I and Type II):**\n    In the Meissner state, the superconductor exhibits perfect diamagnetism, meaning the magnetic flux density inside is zero: $B_{\\mathrm{i}} = \\mu_0 (H_{\\mathrm{i}}+M) = 0$. This implies a relationship between the internal field and magnetization: $M = -H_{\\mathrm{i}}$.\n    Substituting this into the magnetostatic relation:\n    $H_{\\mathrm{i}} = H_{\\mathrm{a}} - N(-H_{\\mathrm{i}}) = H_{\\mathrm{a}} + N H_{\\mathrm{i}}$.\n    Solving for $H_{\\mathrm{i}}$ gives $H_{\\mathrm{i}} = \\frac{H_{\\mathrm{a}}}{1 - N}$.\n    The measured magnetization $M$ as a function of the applied field $H_{\\mathrm{a}}$ is therefore:\n    $$M = -H_{\\mathrm{i}} = -\\frac{H_{\\mathrm{a}}}{1 - N}$$\n    The slope is $\\mathrm{d}M/\\mathrm{d}H_{\\mathrm{a}} = -1/(1-N)$.\n\n2.  **Onset of Flux Entry:**\n    Flux enters when the internal field $H_{\\mathrm{i}}$ reaches an intrinsic critical value.\n    - For Type I, this is $H_{\\mathrm{i}} = H_{\\mathrm{c}}$.

The magnitude of this slope is $1/(1-N)$. Since $0 \\le N < 1$, as $N$ increases, $(1-N)$ decreases, causing the magnitude $1/(1-N)$ to increase. An increased magnitude of a negative slope means it becomes more negative. The statement is correct.\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\n**B. The applied field at which flux first enters the sample is reduced by geometry: for a type I superconductor it occurs at $H_{\\mathrm{a}}^{\\mathrm{on}} = (1-N)\\,H_{\\mathrm{c}}$, and for a type II superconductor it occurs at $H_{\\mathrm{a}}^{\\mathrm{on}} = (1-N)\\,H_{\\mathrm{c1}}$ (neglecting surface barriers). Thus, dividing the observed onset field by $(1-N)$ yields the corresponding intrinsic entry field.**\nOur derivation shows that the onset applied field is $H_{\\mathrm{a}}^{\\mathrm{on}} = (1-N)H_{\\mathrm{c}}$ for type I and $H_{\\mathrm{a}}^{\\mathrm{on}} = (1-N)H_{\\mathrm{c1}}$ for type II. Since $N > 0$ for any non-infinitesimally thin sample, the factor $(1-N)$ is less than $1$, so the onset field is indeed reduced. To find the intrinsic field ($H_{\\mathrm{c}}$ or $H_{\\mathrm{c1}}$) from the measured onset field $H_{\\mathrm{a}}^{\\mathrm{on}}$, one must compute $H_{\\mathrm{c}} = H_{\\mathrm{a}}^{\\mathrm{on}} / (1-N)$. This is precisely what the statement claims.\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\n**C. For a type II superconductor, the same $(1-N)$ rescaling used for the onset also applies to the upper critical field: the intrinsic $H_{\\mathrm{c2}}$ is obtained by dividing the applied field where $M$ vanishes by $(1-N)$.**\nOur analysis of the $H_{\\mathrm{c2}}$ transition shows that because $M=0$ at this point, the internal field equals the applied field: $H_{\\mathrm{i}} = H_{\\mathrm{a}}$. The intrinsic transition occurs at $H_{\\mathrm{i}} = H_{\\mathrm{c2}}$, which means the measured applied field is directly $H_{\\mathrm{a}} = H_{\\mathrm{c2}}$. No rescaling is necessary. The statement is false.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**D. A general geometry correction valid beyond the Meissner regime is to reconstruct the internal magnetic field $H_{\\mathrm{i}}$ from the data using $H_{\\mathrm{i}} = H_{\\mathrm{a}} - N\\,M(H_{\\mathrm{a}})$ at each measurement point and then replot $M$ as a function of $H_{\\mathrm{i}}$. This procedure collapses the curves onto the intrinsic $M(H)$ of the material (for an ellipsoid in reversible equilibrium), restoring the correct positions of $H_{\\mathrm{c}}$, $H_{\\mathrm{c1}}$, and $H_{\\mathrm{c2}}$ on the field axis.**\nThe function $M(H_{\\mathrm{i}})$ is the fundamental material property. The relation $H_{\\mathrm{i}} = H_{\\mathrm{a}} - N M$ is a general magnetostatic result for ellipsoids, valid as long as $M$ is uniform (which is true for reversible states in an ellipsoid). Therefore, taking measured data pairs $(H_{\\mathrm{a}}, M)$ and computing $H_{\\mathrm{i}}$ for each point allows one to reconstruct the intrinsic $M(H_{\\mathrm{i}})$ curve from the experimental $M(H_{\\mathrm{a}})$ curve. This is the standard procedure for correcting for demagnetization and correctly places all critical fields ($H_{\\mathrm{c}}$, $H_{\\mathrm{c1}}$, $H_{\\mathrm{c2}}$) at their intrinsic values on the new field axis $H_{\\mathrm{i}}$.\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\n**E. In the type I intermediate state of an ellipsoidal sample, $M(H_{\\mathrm{a}})$ between the onset of flux entry and the fully normal state is independent of $N$ because the superconducting domains screen the field locally, making the macroscopic demagnetization irrelevant.**\nIn the intermediate state, the internal field is pinned at $H_{\\mathrm{i}} = H_{\\mathrm{c}}$. From the magnetostatic relation, $H_{\\mathrm{c}} = H_{\\mathrm{a}} - N M$, which gives $M(H_{\\mathrm{a}}) = (H_{\\mathrm{a}} - H_{\\mathrm{c}})/N$. This expression clearly shows that the magnetization is strongly dependent on the demagnetization factor $N$. The statement is false.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{ABD}$$", "id": "2869235"}]}
