This change is defined as:\n$$\n\\Delta \\gamma = \\gamma_{(2\\times 1)} - \\gamma_{(1\\times 1)}\n$$\nwhere $\\gamma$ represents the surface energy per unit area. The provided model considers only local energetic contributions from dangling bonds and dimer bonds.\n\nFirst, we determine the surface energy of the ideal $(1\\times 1)$ surface, $\\gamma_{(1\\times 1)}$.\nThe areal density of surface atoms is given as $\\sigma$. For the ideal $(1\\times 1)$ termination, each surface atom has $2$ unsatisfied dangling bonds. Each dangling bond contributes an energy penalty of $E_{\\mathrm{db}}$. There are no dimer bonds on this surface.

Since two surface atoms form one dimer, the areal density of dimers is $\\frac{\\sigma}{2}$. The problem states that each dimer contains $1$ dimer bond.

It presents a standard theoretical exercise in surface crystallography, based on established principles of solid-state physics. The problem is self-contained and free of contradictions or ambiguities. I will therefore proceed with a complete solution.\n\nThe problem is partitioned into three tasks. We will address them in sequence.\n\nTask A: We must identify a primitive set of two-dimensional lattice vectors for the unreconstructed $(1\\times 1)$ surface of a Face-Centered Cubic (FCC) crystal. The crystal has a cubic lattice parameter $a$, and the surface is the $(100)$ plane. The coordinate system is defined such that the surface normal is along the $[100]$ direction, and the in-plane axes are along $[010]$ and $[001]$.\n\nThe positions of atoms in an FCC lattice can be described by vectors $\\mathbf{R} = (n_x \\frac{a}{2}, n_y \\frac{a}{2}, n_z \\frac{a}{2})$, where $n_x, n_y, n_z$ are integers and their sum $n_x+n_y+n_z$ is an even number. For the $(100)$ surface, we consider atoms lying on a plane of constant $x$-coordinate. Let us choose the plane $x=0$, which corresponds to setting $n_x=0$. The condition on the remaining indices becomes $n_y+n_z$ must be even. This implies that $n_y$ and $n_z$ must have the same parity (both even or both odd).\n\nThe resulting arrangement of atoms in the $y-z$ plane is a centered square lattice. This is the two-dimensional Bravais lattice of the surface. To generate this lattice, we must find a set of primitive translation vectors. A primitive cell is a minimal-area cell that, when translated by all lattice vectors, tiles the entire plane without overlap. For the centered square lattice, the primitive cell is a rhombus, which in this specific case is a square rotated by $45$ degrees relative to the cubic axes.\n\nLet us define the origin at an atom at $(0,0,0)$. The nearest neighbor atoms in the plane are at positions like $(0, a/2, a/2)$, $(0, a/2, -a/2)$, $(0, -a/2, a/2)$, and so on. A valid choice for a set of primitive lattice vectors, which we will denote as $\\mathbf{a}_1$ and $\\mathbf{a}_2$, must connect the origin to two non-collinear nearest lattice points such that they form a basis for the entire lattice. We can choose:\n$$\n\\mathbf{a}_1 = \\frac{a}{2}(0, 1, 1)\n$$\n$$\n\\mathbf{a}_2 = \\frac{a}{2}(0, 1, -1)\n$$\nThese two vectors are orthogonal, as their dot product is $\\mathbf{a}_1 \\cdot \\mathbf{a}_2 = (\\frac{a}{2})^2 (1 \\cdot 1 + 1 \\cdot (-1)) = 0$. They generate a square unit cell of minimal area, $A = |\\mathbf{a}_1| |\\mathbf{a}_2| = \\sqrt{(\\frac{a}{2})^2(1^2+1^2)} \\sqrt{(\\frac{a}{2})^2(1^2+(-1)^2)} = (\\frac{a}{\\sqrt{2}})(\\frac{a}{\\sqrt{2}}) = \\frac{a^2}{2}$. Any atom position on the surface can be written as $n_1 \\mathbf{a}_1 + n_2 \\mathbf{a}_2$ for integers $n_1, n_2$. This fulfills the requirements of Task A.\n\nTask B: The surface undergoes a $(2\\times 1)$ reconstruction. The notation is specified to be with respect to the primitive vectors $\\mathbf{a}_1$ and $\\mathbf{a}_2$ found in Task A. This means the new primitive lattice vectors of the reconstructed surface, which we denote as $\\mathbf{a}'_1$ and $\\mathbf{a}'_2$, are given by:\n$$\n\\mathbf{a}'_1 = 2 \\, \\mathbf{a}_1 = 2 \\left( \\frac{a}{2}(0, 1, 1) \\right) = a(0, 1, 1)\n$$\n$$\n\\mathbf{a}'_2 = 1 \\, \\mathbf{a}_2 = \\frac{a}{2}(0, 1, -1)\n$$\nThese vectors define the direct lattice of the reconstructed surface.\n\nTask C: We must analyze the change in the reciprocal lattice and count the new \"fractional-order\" spots within a specific region. First, we determine the reciprocal lattice vectors $\\mathbf{b}_1, \\mathbf{b}_2$ for the unreconstructed surface. They are defined by the relation $\\mathbf{a}_i \\cdot \\mathbf{b}_j = 2\\pi \\delta_{ij}$, where $\\delta_{ij}$ is the Kronecker delta. Since $\\mathbf{a}_1$ and $\\mathbf{a}_2$ are orthogonal, the reciprocal vectors are parallel to them:\n$$\n\\mathbf{b}_1 = \\frac{2\\pi}{|\\mathbf{a}_1|^2} \\mathbf{a}_1 = \\frac{2\\pi}{a^2/2} \\left( \\frac{a}{2}(0, 1, 1) \\right) = \\frac{2\\pi}{a}(0, 1, 1)\n$$\n$$\n\\mathbf{b}_2 = \\frac{2\\pi}{|\\mathbf{a}_2|^2} \\mathbf{a}_2 = \\frac{2\\pi}{a^2/2} \\left( \\frac{a}{2}(0, 1, -1) \\right) = \\frac{2\\pi}{a}(0, 1, -1)\n$$\nThe reciprocal lattice of the unreconstructed surface consists of all points $\\mathbf{G} = h\\mathbf{b}_1 + k\\mathbf{b}_2$ for integers $h, k$.\n\nNext, we find the reciprocal lattice vectors $\\mathbf{b}'_1, \\mathbf{b}'_2$ for the reconstructed surface. We can use the matrix relationship between direct and reciprocal bases. If the new direct lattice vectors are related to the old ones by $\\mathbf{A}' = \\mathbf{A}M$, where $\\mathbf{A}$ is the matrix whose columns are the basis vectors and $M$ is an integer matrix, then the reciprocal bases are related by $\\mathbf{B}' = \\mathbf{B}(M^T)^{-1}$. In our case:\n$$\n\\begin{pmatrix} \\mathbf{a}'_1 & \\mathbf{a}'_2 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\mathbf{a}_1 & \\mathbf{a}_2 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} 2 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nSo, $M = \\begin{pmatrix} 2 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$. Its inverse transpose is $(M^T)^{-1} = \\left(\\begin{pmatrix} 2 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}\\right)^{-1} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1/2 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$.\nTherefore, the new reciprocal vectors are:\n$$\n\\mathbf{b}'_1 = \\frac{1}{2}\\mathbf{b}_1 = \\frac{\\pi}{a}(0, 1, 1)\n$$\n$$\n\\mathbf{b}'_2 = \\mathbf{b}_2 = \\frac{2\\pi}{a}(0, 1, -1)\n$$\nThe reciprocal lattice points of the reconstructed surface are given by $\\mathbf{G}' = h'\\mathbf{b}'_1 + k'\\mathbf{b}'_2$ for integers $h', k'$. Substituting the expressions for $\\mathbf{b}'_1$ and $\\mathbf{b}'_2$:\n$$\n\\mathbf{G}' = h'\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\mathbf{b}_1\\right) + k'\\mathbf{b}_2 = \\frac{h'}{2}\\mathbf{b}_1 + k'\\mathbf{b}_2\n$$\nThe points of the reconstructed reciprocal lattice coincide with the points of the unreconstructed lattice if the coefficients of $\\mathbf{b}_1$ and $\\mathbf{b}_2$ are both integers. This occurs when $h'$ is an even integer. When $h'$ is an odd integer, the coefficient $h'/2$ is a half-integer, and these points $\\mathbf{G}'$ represent new, \"fractional-order\" diffraction spots that do not exist for the unreconstructed surface.\n\nWe are asked to count these new points within the fundamental reciprocal parallelogram of the unreconstructed surface defined by linear combinations $u\\,\\mathbf{b}_{1}+v\\,\\mathbf{b}_{2}$ with $u\\in[0,1)$ and $v\\in[0,1)$. This region is the primitive cell of the unreconstructed reciprocal lattice.\nWe need to find the number of points $\\mathbf{G}' = \\frac{h'}{2}\\mathbf{b}_1 + k'\\mathbf{b}_2$ that lie in this region. This requires finding integer pairs $(h', k')$ such that:\n$$\n0 \\le \\frac{h'}{2} < 1 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad 0 \\le k' < 1\n$$\nFrom the second inequality, since $k'$ must be an integer, the only solution is $k'=0$.\nFrom the first inequality, $0 \\le h' < 2$. Since $h'$ must be an integer, the solutions are $h'=0$ and $h'=1$.\nThis gives two points of the reconstructed reciprocal lattice inside the specified region:\n1. For $(h', k') = (0,0)$: The point is $\\mathbf{G}' = 0 \\cdot \\mathbf{b}_1 + 0 \\cdot \\mathbf{b}_2 = \\mathbf{0}$. This corresponds to $(u,v)=(0,0)$ and is a reciprocal lattice point of the original unreconstructed surface.\n2. For $(h', k') = (1,0)$: The point is $\\mathbf{G}' = \\frac{1}{2}\\mathbf{b}_1 + 0 \\cdot \\mathbf{b}_2 = \\frac{1}{2}\\mathbf{b}_1$. This corresponds to $(u,v)=(1/2,0)$. Since the coefficient of $\\mathbf{b}_1$ is not an integer, this point does not coincide with any reciprocal lattice point of the unreconstructed surface. It is a new, fractional-order spot.\n\nThe question asks for the number of such *new* fractional-order spots. Out of the two reconstructed lattice points found in the specified region, only one is new.
