The final answer must be a single analytic expression.", "solution": "The problem requires the derivation of the magnetic field, $B$, necessary to observe the fractional quantum Hall state at a filling factor of $\\nu = \\frac{1}{3}$ in a two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) with a given areal electron density, $n$. The derivation must proceed from fundamental principles.\n\nWe begin by considering a 2DEG confined to the $xy$-plane with a uniform magnetic field $\\vec{B}$ applied perpendicularly, i.e., $\\vec{B} = B\\hat{z}$. In such a configuration, the energy spectrum of the electrons quantizes into a discrete set of highly degenerate energy levels known as Landau levels.\n\nThe degeneracy of each Landau level represents the number of available single-particle quantum states per unit area. This degeneracy, denoted as $n_B$, is a fundamental quantity in the physics of the quantum Hall effect. It is solely determined by the magnitude of the magnetic field $B$ and is independent of the electron's mass or the specific Landau level index. The degeneracy is equal to the number of magnetic flux quanta, $\\Phi_0$, that thread a unit area. The magnetic flux quantum is a fundamental constant given by $\\Phi_0 = \\frac{h}{e}$, where $h$ is Planck's constant and $e$ is the elementary charge.\n\nThus, the degeneracy per unit area, $n_B$, can be expressed as:\n$$ n_B = \\frac{B}{\\Phi_0} $$\nSubstituting the expression for $\\Phi_0$, we obtain:\n$$ n_B = \\frac{B}{h/e} = \\frac{eB}{h} $$\nThe problem states that the system is completely spin-polarized. This implies that the Zeeman energy splitting is large enough that for each orbital Landau level, only one of the two possible spin states is occupied. Consequently, the total degeneracy of each energy level, including spin, is simply $n_B$. If spin was not polarized, the degeneracy would be $2n_B$.\n\nThe filling factor, $\\nu$, is defined as the ratio of the total areal electron density, $n$, to the degeneracy of a single (spin-polarized) Landau level, $n_B$. The filling factor quantifies the extent to which the available states in the Landau levels are occupied by electrons.\n$$ \\nu = \\frac{n}{n_B} $$\nThis relationship is the cornerstone of the quantum Hall effect. For the integer effect, $\\nu$ is an integer. For the fractional effect, $\\nu$ is a rational number, a phenomenon arising from strong electron-electron correlations.\n\nWe are given that the system should be prepared in the state corresponding to the filling factor $\\nu = \\frac{1}{3}$. We substitute this value and the expression for $n_B$ into the definition of the filling factor:\n$$ \\frac{1}{3} = \\frac{n}{n_B} = \\frac{n}{(eB/h)} $$\nThis equation can be rearranged as:\n$$ \\frac{1}{3} = \\frac{nh}{eB} $$\nOur objective is to find the magnetic field $B$ that satisfies this condition. We solve this algebraic equation for $B$:\n$$ eB = 3nh $$\n$$ B = \\frac{3nh}{e} $$\nThis is the final expression for the magnetic field required to achieve the $\\nu = \\frac{1}{3}$ fractional quantum Hall state. This result depends only on the electron density $n$ and the fundamental constants $h$ and $e$. It is important to note that the effective mass of the electron, $m^{\\ast} = 0.067 m_{e}$, does not appear in the final expression. The degeneracy of Landau levels is a purely quantum mechanical and geometric property related to the magnetic length, and it is independent of the particle's mass. The other assumptions, such as zero temperature and negligible disorder, are idealizations required to observe sharply quantized Hall plateaus, but they do not alter the fundamental relationship between $B$, $n$, and $\\nu$. Using SI units for $n$ (in $m^{-2}$), $h$ (in $J \\cdot s$), and $e$ (in $C$), the resulting value for $B$ will be in Tesla, as requested.", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{\\frac{3nh}{e}} $$", "id": "2824435"}, {"introduction": "Having established how to configure a system at a fractional filling factor, we now probe the remarkable nature of the resulting quantum fluid.

Start from the following well-tested and fundamental physical setting and mapping. A two-dimensional electron gas in a strong perpendicular magnetic field has Landau level quantization; when the cyclotron gap is large, low-energy physics is captured by the lowest Landau level. In Landau gauge on a torus or a cylinder, guiding-center coordinates map the problem to a one-dimensional chain of $N_\\phi$ orbitals labeled by integers $i \\in \\{0,1,\\dots,N_\\phi-1\\}$. In the thin-torus limit, the lowest Landau level projected two-body interaction reduces to a purely electrostatic density–density interaction that depends only on the separation of occupied orbitals. This yields a Hamiltonian that is diagonal in the occupation number basis,\n$$\nH \\;=\\; \\sum_{0 \\le i &lt; j \\le N_\\phi-1} V_{d(i,j)} \\, n_i \\, n_j,\n$$\nwhere $n_i \\in \\{0,1\\}$ is the fermion occupation, and $d(i,j)$ is a geometry-dependent separation: for a torus (periodic boundary conditions), $d(i,j) = \\min\\!\\big(|i-j|,\\, N_\\phi - |i-j|\\big)$; for a cylinder (open boundary conditions), $d(i,j) = |i-j|$. The coefficients $V_k$ are positive, monotonically decreasing with separation $k$, capturing short-range repulsion of guiding centers. For numerical definiteness, truncate interactions at range $K_{\\max}$ and take\n$$\nV_k \\;=\\; e^{-\\alpha k}, \\quad \\text{for } k \\in \\{1,2,\\dots,K_{\\max}\\}, \\quad \\text{and } V_k \\;=\\; 0 \\text{ for } k > K_{\\max},\n$$\nwith a given decay parameter $\\alpha > 0$. This is a standard thin-torus electrostatic model that captures ground-state patterns and low-lying excitations characteristic of fractional quantum Hall phases.\n\nYour task is to: given a geometry, a number of orbitals $N_\\phi$, a particle number $N$ (with Fock space restricted to fixed $N$), and interaction parameters $(\\alpha, K_{\\max})$, perform exact diagonalization by enumerating all $N$-particle Fock basis states, computing their energies under $H$, and extracting the low-lying spectrum. Because $H$ is diagonal in the occupation basis, \"diagonalization\" reduces to computing the set of energies and their degeneracies. From first principles, interpret the low-lying spectrum as follows:\n- At filling $1/3$, that is $N = N_\\phi/3$ for integer $N_\\phi/3$, on a torus, the thin-torus ground states form the Tao–Thouless charge-density patterns with unit-cell length $3$, for example $100100\\ldots$. Translational symmetry implies exactly $3$ degenerate ground states corresponding to the $3$ distinct translations of the unit cell. The first excited manifold corresponds to the creation of a nearest domain wall, interpretable as a localized quasiparticle–quasihole pair.\n- On a cylinder (open boundary), the translation symmetry is broken, so the ground state is unique and pinned. The lowest excitations are edge rearrangements with energies set by $V_k$ that can be parametrically smaller than bulk domain-wall energies.\n\nImplement the above and, for each test case, compute the following four quantities:\n- $E_0$: the ground-state energy (the smallest energy over all $N$-particle basis states),\n- $g_0$: the ground-state degeneracy (the number of states at exactly $E_0$ within a numerical tolerance),\n- $E_1$: the first excited energy (the smallest energy strictly greater than $E_0$ by more than the tolerance),\n- $\\Delta \\equiv E_1 - E_0$: the many-body gap between the ground-state manifold and the first excited level.\n\nAlgorithmic requirements:\n- Enumerate all $\\binom{N_\\phi}{N}$ occupation bitstrings of length $N_\\phi$ with exactly $N$ ones.\n- For each bitstring, compute the energy by summing $V_{d(i,j)}$ over occupied pairs with $d(i,j) \\le K_{\\max}$.\n- Use an absolute tolerance of $10^{-12}$ to identify energy degeneracies and to separate distinct energy levels.\n- For torus geometry, use the distance $d(i,j) = \\min(|i-j|,\\, N_\\phi - |i-j|)$; for cylinder geometry, $d(i,j) = |i-j|$.\n- Use the interaction $V_k = e^{-\\alpha k}$ for $k \\in \\{1,2,\\dots,K_{\\max}\\}$ and $V_k = 0$ otherwise.\n\nTest suite:\nProvide outputs for the following five cases (they cover a general $1/3$-filling torus, a smaller system at $1/3$, an open-boundary edge case, a boundary-size case, and an off-commensurate filling illustrating domain walls):\n- Case A: geometry = torus, $N_\\phi = 12$, $N = 4$, $\\alpha = 0.7$, $K_{\\max} = 4$.\n- Case B: geometry = torus, $N_\\phi = 9$, $N = 3$, $\\alpha = 0.7$, $K_{\\max} = 4$.\n- Case C: geometry = cylinder, $N_\\phi = 9$, $N = 3$, $\\alpha = 0.7$, $K_{\\max} = 4$.\n- Case D: geometry = torus, $N_\\phi = 6$, $N = 2$, $\\alpha = 0.7$, $K_{\\max} = 4$.\n- Case E: geometry = torus, $N_\\phi = 10$, $N = 3$, $\\alpha = 0.7$, $K_{\\max} = 4$.\n\nFinal output format:\nYour program should produce a single line of output containing a JSON-like list of five entries, one per test case, in the same order as the cases above. Each entry must be a list of the form $[E_0, g_0, E_1, \\Delta]$ where $E_0$, $E_1$, and $\\Delta$ are floating-point numbers rounded to exactly $10$ decimal places, and $g_0$ is an integer. For example, an output with two hypothetical cases would look like $[[0.1234567890,3,0.2345678901,0.1111111011],[\\dots]]$. There are no physical units; energies are dimensionless by construction.

The model, Hamiltonian, and parameters are scientifically sound and provide a self-contained framework for a meaningful numerical study. There are no logical contradictions, ambiguities, or factual inaccuracies. The problem is therefore deemed **valid**, and we may proceed to the solution.\n\nThe fundamental task is to determine the low-energy portion of the spectrum for a system of $N$ interacting spinless fermions distributed among $N_\\phi$ orbitals. The Hamiltonian is given as:\n$$\nH = \\sum_{0 \\le i < j \\le N_\\phi-1} V_{d(i,j)} \\, n_i \\, n_j\n$$\nwhere $n_i \\in \\{0, 1\\}$ is the occupation number of orbital $i$. This Hamiltonian is diagonal in the Fock basis of occupation numbers. Consequently, \"exact diagonalization\" is a misnomer; the task simplifies to the direct computation of the energy for each basis state. A basis state is defined by the set of occupied orbitals $\\{o_1, o_2, \\dots, o_N\\}$, where $n_{o_k} = 1$ for $k \\in \\{1, \\dots, N\\}$ and $n_i=0$ otherwise. The energy of such a state is:\n$$\nE = \\sum_{1 \\le a < b \\le N} V_{d(o_a, o_b)}\n$$\nThe procedure is as follows:\n\n1.  **State Space Enumeration**: The Hilbert space is spanned by all possible configurations of $N$ particles in $N_\\phi$ orbitals. This corresponds to enumerating all combinations of $N$ distinct orbital indices from the set $\\{0, 1, \\dots, N_\\phi-1\\}$. The total number of such states is $\\binom{N_\\phi}{N}$. Each state is represented by a tuple of occupied orbital indices.\n\n2.  **Interaction Potential**: The interaction potential $V_k$ between two particles separated by a distance $k$ is defined as:\n    $$\n    V_k = \\begin{cases} e^{-\\alpha k} & \\text{for } 1 \\le k \\le K_{\\max} \\\\ 0 & \\text{for } k > K_{\\max} \\end{cases}\n    $$\n    where $\\alpha > 0$ is a decay parameter and $K_{\\max}$ is the maximum interaction range. It is computationally efficient to pre-calculate and store the values of $V_k$ for $k \\in \\{1, \\dots, K_{\\max}\\}$.\n\n3.  **Distance Metric**: The distance $d(i,j)$ between orbitals $i$ and $j$ depends on the geometry of the system.\n    -   For a **torus**, which implies periodic boundary conditions, the distance is the shorter of the two paths along the circle:\n        $$\n        d(i, j) = \\min(|i-j|, N_\\phi - |i-j|)\n        $$\n    -   For a **cylinder**, which implies open boundary conditions, the distance is simply the separation on the line:\n        $$\n        d(i, j) = |i-j|\n        $$\n\n4.  **Energy Calculation**: For each of the $\\binom{N_\\phi}{N}$ states, we compute its energy. This involves iterating through all unique pairs of occupied orbitals $(o_a, o_b)$ within that state, calculating their distance $d(o_a, o_b)$, and summing the corresponding interaction potentials $V_{d(o_a, o_b)}$.\n\n5.  **Spectrum Analysis**: After computing the energy for every state in the Fock space, the resulting list of energies is analyzed to extract the required quantities.\n    -   First, the list of all energies is sorted in ascending order.\n    -   Due to the finite precision of floating-point arithmetic, energies must be compared using a numerical tolerance, specified as $\\epsilon = 10^{-12}$.\n    -   The ground-state energy, $E_0$, is the first element of the sorted list.\n    -   The ground-state degeneracy, $g_0$, is determined by counting the number of energies in the list that are within the tolerance $\\epsilon$ of $E_0$. Formally, it is the count of energies $E$ such that $|E - E_0| \\le \\epsilon$.\n    -   The first excited energy, $E_1$, is the first energy in the sorted list that is strictly greater than $E_0$ by more than the tolerance $\\epsilon$. Formally, it is the smallest energy $E$ such that $E - E_0 > \\epsilon$. If all states are degenerate, no such $E_1$ exists; however, the provided interaction model guarantees a non-trivial spectrum for the given test cases.\n    -   The many-body gap, $\\Delta$, is the difference between the first excited energy and the ground-state energy:\n        $$\n        \\Delta = E_1 - E_0\n        $$\n\nThis systematic, brute-force enumeration and calculation is guaranteed to find the exact ground and first excited states for the given model Hamiltonian, as the Hilbert space is finite and the Hamiltonian is diagonal in the chosen basis.
