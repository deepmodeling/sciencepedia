All provided constants and definitions are standard in the field of condensed matter physics. Thus, the problem is valid, and a solution will be derived from fundamental principles as requested.\n\nThe derivation proceeds in three parts as required by the problem statement.\n\nFirst, we determine the diameter $d$ of the nanotube.\nThe geometry of the nanotube is defined by the chiral vector $\\mathbf{C}_h = n \\mathbf{a}_1 + m \\mathbf{a}_2$, where $(\\mathbf{a}_1, \\mathbf{a}_2)$ are the primitive lattice vectors of the graphene sheet. The problem specifies the chiral indices $(n, m) = (10, 0)$, so the chiral vector is $\\mathbf{C}_h = 10 \\mathbf{a}_1$.\nThe magnitude of the primitive vectors is given as $|\\mathbf{a}_1| = |\\mathbf{a}_2| = a$.\nThe circumference $C$ of the nanotube is the magnitude of the chiral vector:\n$$C = |\\mathbf{C}_h| = |10 \\mathbf{a}_1| = 10 |\\mathbf{a}_1| = 10 a$$\nThe problem defines the diameter $d$ as the circumference divided by $\\pi$:\n$$d = \\frac{C}{\\pi} = \\frac{10 a}{\\pi}$$\nSubstituting the given value $a = 0.246\\,\\mathrm{nm}$:\n$$d = \\frac{10 \\times 0.246\\,\\mathrm{nm}}{\\pi} = \\frac{2.46}{\\pi}\\,\\mathrm{nm} \\approx 0.78298\\,\\mathrm{nm}$$\nRounding to three significant figures, we get $d \\approx 0.783\\,\\mathrm{nm}$.\n\nSecond, we determine the spacing $\\Delta k_\\perp$ between allowed transverse wavevectors.\nThe electronic states in the nanotube must satisfy the Born–von Kármán periodic boundary condition around the circumference. For a plane-wave-like state $\\psi(\\mathbf{r}) \\propto \\exp(i\\mathbf{k}\\cdot\\mathbf{r})$, this condition is $\\psi(\\mathbf{r}+\\mathbf{C}_h) = \\psi(\\mathbf{r})$, which implies $\\exp(i\\mathbf{k}\\cdot\\mathbf{C}_h) = 1$. This leads to the quantization of the wavevector component along the chiral vector:\n$$\\mathbf{k} \\cdot \\mathbf{C}_h = 2\\pi j, \\quad j \\in \\mathbb{Z}$$\nThe wavevector component perpendicular to the tube axis, which lies along the circumferential direction of the rolled-up sheet, is denoted $k_\\perp$. This component is the projection of $\\mathbf{k}$ onto the direction of $\\mathbf{C}_h$. Thus, $k_\\perp = \\mathbf{k} \\cdot \\frac{\\mathbf{C}_h}{|\\mathbf{C}_h|}$.\nThe quantization condition can be written as:\n$$k_\\perp |\\mathbf{C}_h| = 2\\pi j \\implies k_{\\perp, j} = \\frac{2\\pi j}{C}$$\nThe allowed transverse wavevectors form a series of parallel lines in the $2$D reciprocal space of graphene.

This occurs if the projection of $\\mathbf{K}$ onto the circumferential direction satisfies the quantization condition for some integer $j$. Mathematically, this is equivalent to the condition $\\mathbf{K} \\cdot \\mathbf{C}_h = 2\\pi j$ for an integer $j$.\nUsing the standard reciprocal lattice representation where $\\mathbf{a}_i \\cdot \\mathbf{b}_j = 2\\pi\\delta_{ij}$, a Dirac point can be written as $\\mathbf{K} = \\frac{1}{3}(2\\mathbf{b}_1 + \\mathbf{b}_2)$. The chiral vector is $\\mathbf{C}_h = n\\mathbf{a}_1 + m\\mathbf{a}_2$. Their dot product is:\n$$\\mathbf{K} \\cdot \\mathbf{C}_h = \\frac{1}{3}(2\\mathbf{b}_1 + \\mathbf{b}_2) \\cdot (n\\mathbf{a}_1 + m\\mathbf{a}_2) = \\frac{1}{3}(2n(\\mathbf{b}_1\\cdot\\mathbf{a}_1) + m(\\mathbf{b}_2\\cdot\\mathbf{a}_2)) = \\frac{2\\pi}{3}(2n+m)$$\nThe tube is metallic if $\\mathbf{K} \\cdot \\mathbf{C}_h = 2\\pi j$ for some integer $j$, which implies that $\\frac{2n+m}{3}$ must be an integer. For the given nanotube $(n,m) = (10,0)$, we have:\n$$\\frac{2(10) + 0}{3} = \\frac{20}{3}$$\nSince $20/3$ is not an integer, the allowed lines do not pass through the Dirac points. Therefore, the $(10,0)$ nanotube is semiconducting. The same conclusion is reached by the simpler rule that an $(n,m)$ tube is semiconducting if $n-m$ is not a multiple of $3$. Here, $n-m = 10$, which is not divisible by $3$.\n\nFor a semiconducting tube, the band gap $E_g$ is determined by the minimum energy distance from a valence band state to a conduction band state. In the linear dispersion approximation, $E(\\mathbf{q}) \\approx \\hbar v_F |\\mathbf{q}|$, where $\\mathbf{q}$ is the wavevector measured from a Dirac point $\\mathbf{K}$. The minimum band gap corresponds to the minimum non-zero value of $|\\mathbf{q}|$. This minimum distance is the shortest separation between a Dirac point and any of the allowed $k_\\perp$ lines.\nThe minimum magnitude of the wavevector offset, $|\\mathbf{q}|_{min}$, is purely in the transverse direction, $|\\mathbf{q}|_{min} = |\\mathbf{q}_\\perp|_{min}$. This offset is the minimum distance between the transverse component of a Dirac point, $k_{\\perp,K} = (\\mathbf{K} \\cdot \\mathbf{C}_h)/C$, and the allowed lines $k_{\\perp,j} = 2\\pi j / C$.\n$$|\\mathbf{q}_\\perp|_{min} = \\min_{j \\in \\mathbb{Z}} |k_{\\perp,j} - k_{\\perp,K}| = \\min_{j \\in \\mathbb{Z}} \\left| \\frac{2\\pi j}{C} - \\frac{2\\pi(2n+m)}{3C} \\right|$$\n$$|\\mathbf{q}_\\perp|_{min} = \\frac{2\\pi}{C} \\min_{j \\in \\mathbb{Z}} \\left| j - \\frac{2n+m}{3} \\right|$$\nFor $(n,m)=(10,0)$, this becomes:\n$$|\\mathbf{q}_\\perp|_{min} = \\frac{2\\pi}{C} \\min_{j \\in \\mathbb{Z}} \\left| j - \\frac{20}{3} \\right|$$\nThe integer $j$ closest to $20/3 \\approx 6.67$ is $j=7$. The minimum difference is $|7 - 20/3| = |21/3 - 20/3| = 1/3$.\nThus, the minimum offset is:\n$$|\\mathbf{q}_\\perp|_{min} = \\frac{2\\pi}{C} \\cdot \\frac{1}{3} = \\frac{2\\pi}{3C}$$\nThe energy of the lowest conduction band state relative to the Dirac point is $E_{min} = \\hbar v_F |\\mathbf{q}_\\perp|_{min}$. The band gap is twice this value, as it is the separation between the valence band maximum and the conduction band minimum, which are symmetric about the Dirac point energy.\n$$E_g = 2 E_{min} = 2 \\hbar v_F |\\mathbf{q}_\\perp|_{min} = 2 \\hbar v_F \\left( \\frac{2\\pi}{3C} \\right) = \\frac{4\\pi \\hbar v_F}{3C}$$\nSubstituting $C = 10 a$:\n$$E_g = \\frac{4\\pi \\hbar v_F}{3 \\times 10 a} = \\frac{2\\pi \\hbar v_F}{15 a}$$\nUsing the given numerical values $\\hbar v_F \\approx 0.658\\,\\mathrm{eV\\,nm}$ and $a = 0.246\\,\\mathrm{nm}$:\n$$E_g = \\frac{4\\pi (0.658\\,\\mathrm{eV\\,nm})}{3 (10 \\times 0.246\\,\\mathrm{nm})} = \\frac{4\\pi \\times 0.658}{7.38}\\,\\mathrm{eV} \\approx 1.1197\\,\\mathrm{eV}$$\nRounding to three significant figures gives $E_g \\approx 1.12\\,\\mathrm{eV}$.\n\nThe final requested values are $d = 0.783\\,\\mathrm{nm}$, $\\Delta k_\\perp = 2.55\\,\\mathrm{nm}^{-1}$, and $E_g = 1.12\\,\\mathrm{eV}$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n0.783 & 2.55 & 1.12\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "2805148"}, {"introduction": "This final practice reverses the typical problem-solving flow, challenging you to think like an experimental materials scientist.

Near these points, the energy dispersion is linear, as given in the problem statement: $E(\\mathbf{q}) = \\pm \\hbar v_{F} |\\mathbf{q}|$, where $\\mathbf{q}$ is the wavevector measured relative to a $\\mathbf{K}$ point. The Fermi velocity $v_{F}$ is derived from the nearest-neighbor tight-binding model for graphene and is given by the expression:\n$$v_{F} = \\frac{3 \\gamma_{0} a_{\\mathrm{cc}}}{2 \\hbar}$$\nwhere $\\gamma_{0}$ is the hopping parameter and $a_{\\mathrm{cc}}$ is the carbon-carbon bond length.\n\nIn a carbon nanotube, the wavevector component perpendicular to the tube axis (the circumferential direction) is quantized due to the periodic boundary condition around the circumference $\\pi d$. This quantization restricts the allowed electronic states to a set of discrete lines in the $2$D Brillouin zone of graphene. For a semiconducting nanotube, none of these lines pass through a $\\mathbf{K}$ point. The interband electronic transitions occur between the valence and conduction bands, which are symmetric about $E=0$. The energy of the $i$-th van Hove singularity, $E_{ii}$, corresponds to twice the energy at the minimum of the $i$-th subband. This minimum energy is determined by the shortest distance in k-space, $|\\mathbf{q}_{\\perp,i}|$, between an allowed wavevector line and a $\\mathbf{K}$ point.\n$$E_{ii} = 2 E(|\\mathbf{q}_{\\perp,i}|) = 2 \\hbar v_{F} |\\mathbf{q}_{\\perp,i}|$$\nFor a semiconducting nanotube, within the simple zone-folding model (ignoring trigonal warping), the wavevectors for the first and second subbands are given by:\n$$|\\mathbf{q}_{\\perp,1}| = \\frac{2}{3d} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad |\\mathbf{q}_{\\perp,2}| = \\frac{4}{3d}$$\nThe energy of the first interband transition, $E_{11}$, is therefore:\n$$E_{11} = 2 \\hbar v_{F} |\\mathbf{q}_{\\perp,1}| = 2 \\hbar v_{F} \\left(\\frac{2}{3d}\\right) = \\frac{4 \\hbar v_{F}}{3d}$$\nSubstituting the expression for $v_{F}$:\n$$E_{11} = \\frac{4 \\hbar}{3d} \\left(\\frac{3 \\gamma_{0} a_{\\mathrm{cc}}}{2 \\hbar}\\right) = \\frac{2 \\gamma_{0} a_{\\mathrm{cc}}}{d}$$\nThis provides the direct relationship between the first optical transition energy and the nanotube's geometric parameters.

The simple model predicts $E_{22}/E_{11} = 2$. The observed deviation is due to trigonal warping effects. The problem states that if $E_{22}/E_{11} < 2$, the nanotube is of the type $(n-m) \\pmod 3 = 1$. Let us compute this ratio from the experimental data:\n$$\\frac{E_{22}}{E_{11}} = \\frac{1.460~\\text{eV}}{0.750~\\text{eV}} \\approx 1.947$$\nSince $1.947 < 2$, the nanotube must satisfy the condition $(n-m) \\pmod 3 = 1$.\n\nSecond, we use the constraint on the chiral angle $\\theta$. The measured angle is $\\theta = 22.0^{\\circ} \\pm 0.5^{\\circ}$, which corresponds to the range $[21.5^{\\circ}, 22.5^{\\circ}]$. The chiral angle is related to the indices $(n,m)$ by:\n$$\\tan \\theta = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}\\, m}{2n + m}$$\nWe can determine the allowed range for the ratio $m/n$:\n$$\\frac{m}{n} = \\frac{2 \\tan \\theta}{\\sqrt{3} - \\tan \\theta}$$\nFor $\\theta = 21.5^{\\circ}$, $\\tan(21.5^{\\circ}) \\approx 0.3939$, leading to $m/n \\approx 0.5887$.\nFor $\\theta = 22.5^{\\circ}$, $\\tan(22.5^{\\circ}) \\approx 0.4142$, leading to $m/n \\approx 0.6286$.\nThus, we require $0.5887 \\le m/n \\le 0.6286$.\n\nThird, we use the constraint on the diameter $d$. The diameter is related to the indices $(n,m)$ by:\n$$d(n,m) = \\frac{a}{\\pi} \\sqrt{n^{2} + m^{2} + nm}$$\nUsing the calculated diameter $d \\approx 1.09813~\\text{nm}$ and the given graphene lattice constant $a=0.246~\\text{nm}$, we can find the value of the integer $N = n^{2} + m^{2} + nm$:\n$$N = n^{2} + m^{2} + nm = \\left(\\frac{\\pi d}{a}\\right)^{2} = \\left(\\frac{\\pi \\times 1.09813~\\text{nm}}{0.246~\\text{nm}}\\right)^{2} \\approx (14.0236)^{2} \\approx 196.66$$\nWe must therefore search for integer pairs $(n,m)$ such that $n^{2} + m^{2} + nm$ is an integer close to $197$.\n\nWe search for integer pairs $(n,m)$ satisfying:\n1. $n > m \\ge 0$ (by convention for $0^{\\circ} \\le \\theta \\le 30^{\\circ}$)\n2. $(n-m) \\pmod 3 = 1$\n3. $0.5887 \\le m/n \\le 0.6286$\n4. $n^2 + m^2 + nm$ is an integer close to $197$.\n\nLet's test candidate pairs. Let us estimate $n$ assuming $m/n \\approx 0.61$ (the midpoint of the allowed ratio range).\n$n^2(1 + 0.61 + 0.61^2) \\approx 196.66 \\implies n^2(1.9821) \\approx 196.66 \\implies n^2 \\approx 99.2 \\implies n \\approx 9.96$.\nThis strongly suggests that $n=10$.\nIf $n=10$, the ratio constraint implies $5.887 \\le m \\le 6.286$. The only integer possibility is $m=6$.\n\nLet's test the candidate pair $(10,6)$:\n1. Chirality condition: $n=10 > m=6 \\ge 0$. Satisfied.\n2. Family type: $n-m = 10-6=4$. Since $4 \\pmod 3 = 1$, this matches the required family. Satisfied.\n3. Chiral angle: For $(10,6)$, the angle is $\\theta = \\arctan\\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{3} \\cdot 6}{2(10)+6}\\right) = \\arctan\\left(\\frac{6\\sqrt{3}}{26}\\right) \\approx \\arctan(0.3997) \\approx 21.78^{\\circ}$. This value is within the experimental uncertainty range of $[21.5^{\\circ}, 22.5^{\\circ}]$. Satisfied.\n4. Diameter: For $(10,6)$, $N = 10^2 + 10 \\cdot 6 + 6^2 = 100 + 60 + 36 = 196$.\nThe diameter is $d(10,6) = \\frac{a}{\\pi}\\sqrt{196} = \\frac{0.246~\\text{nm}}{\\pi} \\times 14 \\approx 1.0962~\\text{nm}$.\nThis theoretical diameter of $1.0962~\\text{nm}$ shows excellent agreement with the diameter of $1.0981~\\text{nm}$ calculated from the experimental $E_{11}$ value. The relative difference is less than $0.2\\%$.\n\nThe pair $(10,6)$ satisfies all constraints with high precision. Other potential candidates, such as those with $n=9$ or $n=11$, either fall outside the angular range, belong to the wrong family, or produce a diameter that is inconsistent with the experimental value. For instance, the pair $(12,7)$ satisfies the angular and diameter constraints reasonably well ($m/n \\approx 0.583$, $\\theta \\approx 21.4^\\circ$, $N=259$), but $n-m=5$, which is $2 \\pmod 3$, corresponding to the wrong family type. The pair $(8,5)$ yields $n-m=3$, which is a metallic nanotube, contradicting the premise.\n\nTherefore, the most plausible indices for the observed nanotube are $(n,m) = (10,6)$.\n\nThe final result requires the diameter rounded to three significant figures ($1.10~\\text{nm}$) and the indices $n=10$ and $m=6$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n1.10 & 10 & 6\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "2805125"}]}
