In a two-dimensional system of area $A$, the allowed wavevectors $\\mathbf{k}$ form a grid in k-space. The area per state (including spin) is given by $(2\\pi)^2/A$. Accounting for a spin degeneracy of $g_s$, the density of states in k-space is uniform.\n\nThe number of states $d N$ within an infinitesimal annulus in k-space, from radius $k$ to $k+dk$, is given by the area of the annulus, $2\\pi k \\, dk$, multiplied by the density of states in k-space:\n$$\ndN = g_s \\frac{A}{(2\\pi)^2} (2\\pi k \\, dk) = g_s \\frac{A}{2\\pi} k \\, dk\n$$\nThe energy dispersion relation is given as $\\varepsilon = \\frac{\\hbar^2 k^2}{2 m^\\ast}$. We can relate energy and wavevector. Differentiating this expression gives:\n$$\nd\\varepsilon = \\frac{\\hbar^2 (2k)}{2 m^\\ast} dk = \\frac{\\hbar^2 k}{m^\\ast} dk \\implies k \\, dk = \\frac{m^\\ast}{\\hbar^2} d\\varepsilon\n$$\nSubstituting this into the expression for $dN$:\n$$\ndN = g_s \\frac{A}{2\\pi} \\left( \\frac{m^\\ast}{\\hbar^2} d\\varepsilon \\right) = \\frac{g_s A m^\\ast}{2\\pi \\hbar^2} d\\varepsilon\n$$\nThe density of states, $D(\\varepsilon) = dN/d\\varepsilon$, is therefore constant for a 2DEG:\n$$\nD(\\varepsilon) = \\frac{g_s A m^\\ast}{2\\pi \\hbar^2}\n$$\nGiven $g_s=2$, this simplifies to:\n$$\nD(\\varepsilon) = \\frac{A m^\\ast}{\\pi \\hbar^2}\n$$\nAt zero temperature ($T=0$), electrons occupy all available energy states up to the Fermi energy, $E_F$. The total number of electrons, $N$, is the integral of the DOS up to $E_F$:\n$$\nN = \\int_0^{E_F} D(\\varepsilon) d\\varepsilon = \\int_0^{E_F} \\frac{A m^\\ast}{\\pi \\hbar^2} d\\varepsilon = \\frac{A m^\\ast}{\\pi \\hbar^2} E_F\n$$\nThe areal density is $n=N/A$.

By direct inspection, the exponent is:\n$$\n\\alpha_{2\\mathrm{D}} = 1\n$$\nFor the 3DEG, we perform an analogous derivation. The number of states up to a Fermi wavevector $k_F$ is $N = g_s \\frac{V}{(2\\pi)^3} (\\frac{4}{3}\\pi k_F^3)$, where $V$ is the volume. The volume density is $n_{3\\mathrm{D}} = N/V$, so $n_{3\\mathrm{D}} \\propto k_F^3$, which implies $k_F \\propto n_{3\\mathrm{D}}^{1/3}$.\nThe Fermi energy is $E_F = \\frac{\\hbar^2 k_F^2}{2m^\\ast}$, so $E_F \\propto k_F^2 \\propto (n_{3\\mathrm{D}}^{1/3})^2 = n_{3\\mathrm{D}}^{2/3}$.\nThe energy per particle for a 3DEG is found to be $E/N = \\frac{3}{5}E_F$. Therefore, the energy per particle scales with density as:\n$$\n\\frac{E}{N} \\propto E_F \\propto n_{3\\mathrm{D}}^{2/3}\n$$\nThe problem uses $n$ to denote density generically. Thus, the scaling exponent for the 3D case is:\n$$\n\\alpha_{3\\mathrm{D}} = \\frac{2}{3}\n$$\nThe three quantities to be reported are the energy per particle for the 2DEG, $\\alpha_{2\\mathrm{D}}$, and $\\alpha_{3\\mathrm{D}}$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\pmatrix{ \\frac{\\pi \\hbar^2 n}{2 m^\\ast} & 1 & \\frac{2}{3} }}\n$$", "id": "3022937"}, {"introduction": "While idealized models are essential for building intuition, real-world 2DEGs are realized in complex semiconductor heterostructures where the confining potential and the electron distribution are intricately linked.

It describes a classic modulation-doped heterostructure, a foundational system in semiconductor physics. The use of a self-consistent Poisson-Schrödinger model is the standard, state-of-the-art theoretical method for analyzing such systems. All physical concepts—band offsets, modulation doping, 2DEG formation, effective mass approximation, BenDaniel-Duke boundary conditions, Fermi-Dirac statistics—are well-established and correctly invoked. The problem is well-posed, asking for the logical structure of a computational procedure rather than a numerical result, and all necessary concepts are provided.

Therefore, the problem statement is **valid**.\n\nWe now proceed to derive the correct procedure and evaluate the options.\n\nThe core of the problem is the mutual dependence of the electronic charge density and the electrostatic potential. The potential energy profile $V(z)$ for electrons determines their quantum mechanical states (subband energies $E_i$ and wavefunctions $\\psi_i(z)$) via the Schrödinger equation. These states, when populated according to Fermi-Dirac statistics up to the Fermi level $E_F$, define the electron charge density $-e\\,n(z)$. This charge density, along with the fixed positive charge of the ionized donors $+e\\,N_D^+(z)$, acts as the source for the electrostatic potential $\\phi(z)$ via Poisson's equation. The electrostatic potential in turn contributes to the total potential energy, $V(z)$. This circular dependence mandates a self-consistent iterative solution.\n\nA correct procedure must contain the following elements:\n$1$. An initial guess for the potential or charge density.\n$2$. A Schrödinger solver step: at iteration $k$, solve the $1$D Schrödinger equation for the envelope function $\\psi_i^{(k)}(z)$ and subband energies $E_i^{(k)}$, using the potential energy $V^{(k)}(z)$.

A charge density calculation step: calculate the $2$D sheet density $n_{2\\mathrm{D},i}^{(k)}$ for each subband by integrating the product of the $2$D density of states and the Fermi-Dirac distribution. At low temperature, this accurately describes the partial or full occupation of subbands. Then, construct the $3$D electron density $n^{(k)}(z) = \\sum_i n_{2\\mathrm{D},i}^{(k)} |\\psi_i^{(k)}(z)|^2$.\n$4$. A Poisson solver step: solve the $1$D Poisson equation for the electrostatic potential $\\phi^{(k+1)}(z)$, using the total space charge density $\\rho^{(k)}(z) = e\\,(N_D^+(z) - n^{(k)}(z))$ as the source. For a heterostructure, this equation must account for the position-dependent dielectric permittivity $\\varepsilon(z)$, i.e., $-\\frac{d}{dz}(\\varepsilon(z) \\frac{d\\phi}{dz}) = \\rho(z)$. Boundary conditions must be physically sound: the electric field $-d\\phi/dz$ should vanish far from the interface for a charge-neutral system, and both $\\phi(z)$ and the electric displacement field $-\\varepsilon(z) d\\phi/dz$ must be continuous at material interfaces.\n$5$. An update step: construct the new potential for the next iteration, $V^{(k+1)}(z)$, from the new electrostatic potential $\\phi^{(k+1)}(z)$. This must include the built-in potential from the band offset, $E_c^0(z)$, the electrostatic term, $-e\\,\\phi^{(k+1)}(z)$, and optionally the exchange-correlation term, $V_{xc}$.

Without lateral confinement, the in-plane spectrum is a continuum.\n- It assumes a classical Boltzmann distribution for electrons along $z$, which fundamentally ignores the quantum confinement that defines the system.\n- The suggestion to use Gauss's law in two dimensions and \"project\" it onto $z$ is incoherent. The potential and charge density vary in the $z$-direction, making the problem inherently one-dimensional from an electrostatics and quantum confinement perspective.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\nBased on this analysis, only Option A provides a logically consistent, physically correct, and complete description of the self-consistent Poisson-Schrödinger procedure.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2868936"}, {"introduction": "The ultimate test of any physical model is its agreement with experiment.

In a magnetic field, the sheet conductivity tensor of a homogeneous isotropic layer has the form\n$$\n\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}\n=\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n\\sigma_{xx} & -\\sigma_{xy} \\\\\n\\sigma_{xy} & \\sigma_{xx}\n\\end{pmatrix},\n$$\nand the corresponding sheet resistivity tensor is the matrix inverse\n$$\n\\boldsymbol{\\rho}\n=\n\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}^{-1}\n=\n\\frac{1}{\\sigma_{xx}^{2}+\\sigma_{xy}^{2}}\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n\\sigma_{xx} & \\sigma_{xy} \\\\\n-\\sigma_{xy} & \\sigma_{xx}\n\\end{pmatrix}.\n$$\nThus,\n$$\n\\rho_{xx}=\\frac{\\sigma_{xx}}{\\sigma_{xx}^{2}+\\sigma_{xy}^{2}},\n\\qquad\n\\rho_{xy}=\\frac{\\sigma_{xy}}{\\sigma_{xx}^{2}+\\sigma_{xy}^{2}}.\n$$\n\nCase A: Parallel conduction in a four-terminal Hall measurement.\n\nThe total sheet conductivity tensor is the sum of the parallel contributions from the dissipationless quantum Hall 2DEG and the parasitic layer.

The Landauer formula gives the two-terminal conductance of the ideal device as\n$$\nG_{Q}=\\nu \\frac{e^{2}}{h},\n$$\nso the two-terminal resistance of the ideal device is\n$$\nR_{Q}=\\frac{1}{G_{Q}}=\\frac{h}{\\nu e^{2}}=\\rho_{xy}^{0}.\n$$\nIn a two-terminal circuit, series elements add. If the source and drain contacts contribute a total series resistance $\\,R_{c}=R_{c1}+R_{c2}\\,$, then the measured two-terminal resistance on the plateau is\n$$\nR_{2t}^{m} = R_{c} + R_{Q} = R_{c} + \\rho_{xy}^{0}.\n$$\nTherefore, the intrinsic quantized Hall resistance is recovered by the subtraction\n$$\n\\rho_{xy}^{0}=R_{2t}^{m}-R_{c}.\n$$\n\nBoth expressions are in ohms because they are sheet resistances (or two-terminal resistances) referenced to the sample and the contact series, respectively.
