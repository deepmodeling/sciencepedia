The problem is free from scientific flaws, contradictions, or unrealistic assumptions within the given framework.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is deemed valid. We proceed with the solution.\n\nThe time-independent Schrödinger equation for the electron in two dimensions is given by:\n$$ H\\psi(x,y) = E\\psi(x,y) $$\nwhere the Hamiltonian $H$ is:\n$$ H = -\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2m^{*}} \\left( \\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial x^2} + \\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial y^2} \\right) + \\frac{1}{2}m^{*}\\omega_{0}^{2}(x^{2}+y^{2}) $$\nThe potential $V(x,y)$ is separable into a sum of two independent potentials, one for the $x$ coordinate and one for the $y$ coordinate: $V(x,y) = V_x(x) + V_y(y)$, where $V_x(x) = \\frac{1}{2}m^{*}\\omega_{0}^{2}x^{2}$ and $V_y(y) = \\frac{1}{2}m^{*}\\omega_{0}^{2}y^{2}$.\nThis allows the Hamiltonian to be written as a sum of two independent 1D Hamiltonians: $H = H_x + H_y$. Consequently, the total wavefunction $\\psi(x,y)$ can be written as a product of 1D wavefunctions, $\\psi(x,y) = \\psi_x(x)\\psi_y(y)$, and the total energy $E$ is the sum of the energies of the 1D systems, $E=E_x+E_y$.\n\nEach 1D problem is the standard quantum harmonic oscillator (QHO). The Schrödinger equation for the $x$-direction is:\n$$ \\left( -\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2m^{*}} \\frac{d^2}{dx^2} + \\frac{1}{2}m^{*}\\omega_{0}^{2}x^{2} \\right) \\psi_x(x) = E_x \\psi_x(x) $$\nThe energy eigenvalues for the 1D QHO are $E_{n_x} = (n_x + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega_0$, where $n_x = 0, 1, 2, \\dots$.

The total ground-state wavefunction $\\psi_0(x,y)$ is the product of the 1D ground-state wavefunctions:\n$$ \\psi_{0}(x,y) = \\psi_{0,x}(x) \\psi_{0,y}(y) $$\n$$ \\psi_{0}(x,y) = \\left(\\frac{m^{*}\\omega_{0}}{\\pi\\hbar}\\right)^{1/4} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{m^{*}\\omega_{0}}{2\\hbar}x^2\\right) \\times \\left(\\frac{m^{*}\\omega_{0}}{\\pi\\hbar}\\right)^{1/4} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{m^{*}\\omega_{0}}{2\\hbar}y^2\\right) $$\n$$ \\psi_{0}(x,y) = \\left(\\frac{m^{*}\\omega_{0}}{\\pi\\hbar}\\right)^{1/2} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{m^{*}\\omega_{0}}{2\\hbar}(x^2+y^2)\\right) $$\nThis is the normalized ground-state wavefunction.\n\nThe characteristic confinement length, $l_0$, is a natural length scale of the harmonic oscillator problem. It appears in the argument of the exponential of the wavefunction, which is typically written in the form $\\exp\\left(-\\frac{x^2+y^2}{2l_0^2}\\right)$.

This occurs when $n_x+n_y=1$, which gives two degenerate states: $(n_x, n_y)=(1,0)$ and $(n_x, n_y)=(0,1)$. The energy of this level is $E_1 = (1+0+1)\\hbar\\omega_0 = 2\\hbar\\omega_0$.\nThe energy spacing between the ground state and the first excited state is $\\Delta E = E_1 - E_0 = 2\\hbar\\omega_0 - \\hbar\\omega_0 = \\hbar\\omega_0$.\n\nThe condition for \"room-temperature operation\" is that the Boltzmann factor for occupying the first excited orbital state relative to the ground state is smaller than $0.01$ at $T=300\\,\\mathrm{K}$.

We will first determine the scattering matrix $S$ from the given physical constraints and then apply the Landauer-Büttiker formalism for quantum transport.\n\nThe system consists of $3$ semi-infinite, single-mode leads. The scattering properties at the junction are described by a $3 \\times 3$ scattering matrix $S$. The matrix elements $S_{ij}$ relate the amplitude of the outgoing mode in lead $i$ to the amplitude of the incoming mode in lead $j$.\n\nThe problem states three constraints on $S$:\n1.  Current conservation (unitarity): $S^{\\dagger}S = I$, where $I$ is the $3 \\times 3$ identity matrix.\n2.  Time-reversal symmetry: $S$ can be chosen to be real and symmetric, so $S^T = S$ and $S^* = S$. This implies $S^{\\dagger} = S^T = S$. The unitarity condition then simplifies to $S^2 = I$.\n3.  Permutation symmetry: The node is symmetric with respect to the permutation of any of the three leads. This implies that all diagonal elements of $S$ are equal to some real number $r$, and all off-diagonal elements are equal to some real number $t$.\n\nFrom these constraints, the scattering matrix $S$ must have the form:\n$$ S = \\begin{pmatrix} r & t & t \\\\ t & r & t \\\\ t & t & r \\end{pmatrix} $$\nNow, we apply the simplified unitarity condition $S^2 = I$:\n$$ S^2 = \\begin{pmatrix} r & t & t \\\\ t & r & t \\\\ t & t & r \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} r & t & t \\\\ t & r & t \\\\ t & t & r \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} r^2 + 2t^2 & 2rt + t^2 & 2rt + t^2 \\\\ 2rt + t^2 & r^2 + 2t^2 & 2rt + t^2 \\\\ 2rt + t^2 & 2rt + t^2 & r^2 + 2t^2 \\end{pmatrix} $$\nFor $S^2$ to be equal to the identity matrix $I = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$, the elements of $S^2$ must satisfy:\n1. $r^2 + 2t^2 = 1$\n2. $2rt + t^2 = 0$\n\nFrom the second equation, we have $t(2r + t) = 0$. This gives two possible solutions:\nCase A: $t=0$. Substituting this into the first equation gives $r^2 = 1$, so $r = \\pm 1$. This corresponds to $S = \\pm I$, which describes three disconnected leads with perfect reflection. This is a trivial case, not a junction, so we discard it.\nCase B: $t = -2r$. Substituting this into the first equation:\n$$ r^2 + 2(-2r)^2 = 1 $$\n$$ r^2 + 2(4r^2) = 1 $$\n$$ 9r^2 = 1 \\implies r^2 = \\frac{1}{9} \\implies r = \\pm \\frac{1}{3} $$\nIf $r = -1/3$, then $t = -2(-1/3) = 2/3$.\nIf $r = 1/3$, then $t = -2(1/3) = -2/3$.\nBoth solutions yield the same transmission and reflection probabilities, as these depend on the squared magnitudes of the S-matrix elements. Let us choose $r = -1/3$ and $t = 2/3$. The scattering matrix is:\n$$ S = \\frac{1}{3} \\begin{pmatrix} -1 & 2 & 2 \\\\ 2 & -1 & 2 \\\\ 2 & 2 & -1 \\end{pmatrix} $$\nThe transmission probability from lead $j$ to lead $i$ is $T_{ij} = |S_{ij}|^2$.\nThe reflection probability for lead $i$ is $T_{ii} = |S_{ii}|^2 = r^2 = (-1/3)^2 = 1/9$.\nThe transmission probability between any two different leads $i \\neq j$ is $T_{ij} = |S_{ij}|^2 = t^2 = (2/3)^2 = 4/9$.\n\nWe now use the Landauer-Büttiker formula for the current $I_i$ flowing from terminal $i$ into the device at zero temperature, given the voltages $V_j$ at each terminal $j$:\n$$ I_i = \\frac{2e^2}{h} \\sum_{j} T_{ij}(V_i - V_j) $$\nwhere the factor of $2$ accounts for spin degeneracy.\nThe problem specifies the voltages $V_1 = V$ and $V_2 = V_3 = 0$.\n\nThe current injected *from* lead $1$ into the device is the net current $I_1$:\n$$ I_1 = \\frac{2e^2}{h} \\left[ T_{12}(V_1-V_2) + T_{13}(V_1-V_3) \\right] $$\n$$ I_{inj,1} = \\frac{2e^2}{h} \\left[ T_{12}(V-0) + T_{13}(V-0) \\right] = \\frac{2e^2}{h} (T_{12} + T_{13}) V $$\nUsing $T_{12} = T_{13} = 4/9$, we get:\n$$ I_{inj,1} = \\frac{2e^2}{h} \\left(\\frac{4}{9} + \\frac{4}{9}\\right) V = \\frac{2e^2}{h} \\frac{8}{9} V $$\nThis is the total net current flowing from the source at lead $1$ into the junction.\n\nThe current exiting *through* lead $2$ is the net current flowing from the device *into* lead $2$. This is equal to $-I_2$. Let's calculate $I_2$:\n$$ I_2 = \\frac{2e^2}{h} \\left[ T_{21}(V_2-V_1) + T_{23}(V_2-V_3) \\right] $$\n$$ I_2 = \\frac{2e^2}{h} \\left[ T_{21}(0-V) + T_{23}(0-0) \\right] = -\\frac{2e^2}{h} T_{21} V $$\nSince $S$ is symmetric, $T_{21} = T_{12} = 4/9$.\n$$ I_2 = -\\frac{2e^2}{h} \\frac{4}{9} V $$\nThe negative sign confirms that the net current flow is out of the device and into lead $2$. The magnitude of the current exiting through lead $2$, denoted $I_{out,2}$, is:\n$$ I_{out,2} = -I_2 = \\frac{2e^2}{h} \\frac{4}{9} V $$\n\nThe problem asks for the fraction $F$ of the current injected from lead $1$ that exits through lead $2$:\n$$ F = \\frac{I_{out,2}}{I_{inj,1}} $$\n$$ F = \\frac{\\frac{2e^2}{h} \\frac{4}{9} V}{\\frac{2e^2}{h} \\frac{8}{9} V} = \\frac{4/9}{8/9} = \\frac{4}{8} = \\frac{1}{2} $$\n\nAlternatively, we can arrive at this result from a direct symmetry argument. The current injected from lead $1$ must be distributed among the other leads. With the applied voltages, current flows out through leads $2$ and $3$, which are both grounded. The permutation symmetry of the junction, explicitly stated as $S_{12}=S_{13}=t$, means the transmission probabilities $T_{21} = |S_{21}|^2$ and $T_{31} = |S_{31}|^2$ are identical. Since leads $2$ and $3$ are indistinguishable from the perspective of lead $1$ and are at the same potential, the outgoing current must split equally between them. Therefore, half of the injected current exits through lead $2$ and the other half through lead $3$. This gives $F = 1/2$ without needing the explicit values of $r$ and $t$, as long as a non-trivial junction ($t \\neq 0$) exists. Our derivation confirms this is the case.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{1}{2}}$$", "id": "2855289"}]}
