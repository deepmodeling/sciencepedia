The expectation is given by the integral:\n$$ \\mathrm{EI}(x) = E[I(x)] = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\max\\{f_{\\min} - y, 0\\} f_{Y(x)}(y) \\, dy $$\nThe term inside the integral is non-zero only for $y < f_{\\min}$. Thus, the integral's upper limit can be changed to $f_{\\min}$, and the $\\max$ function can be removed:\n$$ \\mathrm{EI}(x) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{f_{\\min}} (f_{\\min} - y) f_{Y(x)}(y) \\, dy $$\nWe can split this into two integrals:\n$$ \\mathrm{EI}(x) = f_{\\min} \\int_{-\\infty}^{f_{\\min}} f_{Y(x)}(y) \\, dy - \\int_{-\\infty}^{f_{\\min}} y f_{Y(x)}(y) \\, dy $$\nTo evaluate these integrals, we introduce a standardized normal variable $Z = \\frac{Y(x) - \\mu(x)}{\\sigma(x)}$, which follows the standard normal distribution $Z \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0, 1)$. Its PDF is $\\phi(z) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi}}\\exp(-\\frac{z^2}{2})$ and its cumulative distribution function (CDF) is $\\Phi(z) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{z} \\phi(t) \\, dt$. The variable transformation is $y = \\mu(x) + z\\sigma(x)$, with $dy = \\sigma(x)dz$. The integration limit $y = f_{\\min}$ corresponds to $z = \\frac{f_{\\min} - \\mu(x)}{\\sigma(x)}$. We define this standardized value as $z_{\\min}$.\n\nThe first term is:\n$$ f_{\\min} \\int_{-\\infty}^{f_{\\min}} f_{Y(x)}(y) \\, dy = f_{\\min} P(Y(x) \\le f_{\\min}) = f_{\\min} P(Z \\le z_{\\min}) = f_{\\min} \\Phi(z_{\\min}) $$\nThe second term is the partial expectation:\n$$ \\int_{-\\infty}^{f_{\\min}} y f_{Y(x)}(y) \\, dy = \\int_{-\\infty}^{z_{\\min}} (\\mu(x) + z\\sigma(x)) \\phi(z) \\, dz $$\n$$ = \\mu(x) \\int_{-\\infty}^{z_{\\min}} \\phi(z) \\, dz + \\sigma(x) \\int_{-\\infty}^{z_{\\min}} z \\phi(z) \\, dz $$\nThe first part of this expression is $\\mu(x) \\Phi(z_{\\min})$. The second part can be solved by direct integration:\n$$ \\int_{-\\infty}^{z_{\\min}} z \\phi(z) \\, dz = \\int_{-\\infty}^{z_{\\min}} \\frac{z}{\\sqrt{2\\pi}}\\exp(-\\frac{z^2}{2}) \\, dz = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi}} \\left[ -\\exp(-\\frac{z^2}{2}) \\right]_{-\\infty}^{z_{\\min}} = -\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi}}\\exp(-\\frac{z_{\\min}^2}{2}) = -\\phi(z_{\\min}) $$\nSo, the second term of $\\mathrm{EI}(x)$ becomes:\n$$ \\int_{-\\infty}^{f_{\\min}} y f_{Y(x)}(y) \\, dy = \\mu(x) \\Phi(z_{\\min}) - \\sigma(x) \\phi(z_{\\min}) $$\nCombining all parts, the closed-form expression for Expected Improvement is:\n$$ \\mathrm{EI}(x) = f_{\\min} \\Phi(z_{\\min}) - (\\mu(x) \\Phi(z_{\\min}) - \\sigma(x) \\phi(z_{\\min})) $$\n$$ \\mathrm{EI}(x) = (f_{\\min} - \\mu(x)) \\Phi(z_{\\min}) + \\sigma(x) \\phi(z_{\\min}) $$\nwhere $z_{\\min} = \\frac{f_{\\min} - \\mu(x)}{\\sigma(x)}$. This completes the derivation.\n\nNow, we compute the EI for candidates $x_{A}$ and $x_{B}$ with $f_{\\min} = -0.48$.\n\nFor candidate $x_{A}$:\n$\\mu_{A} = -0.45$, $\\sigma_{A} = 0.12$.\nThe standardized improvement threshold is:\n$$ z_A = \\frac{f_{\\min} - \\mu_A}{\\sigma_A} = \\frac{-0.48 - (-0.45)}{0.12} = \\frac{-0.03}{0.12} = -0.25 $$\nThe Expected Improvement is:\n$$ \\mathrm{EI}(x_A) = (f_{\\min} - \\mu_A) \\Phi(z_A) + \\sigma_A \\phi(z_A) = (-0.03) \\Phi(-0.25) + (0.12) \\phi(-0.25) $$\nUsing standard normal distribution tables or a calculator:\n$\\Phi(-0.25) \\approx 0.401294$\n$\\phi(-0.25) = \\phi(0.25) \\approx 0.386668$\n$$ \\mathrm{EI}(x_A) \\approx (-0.03)(0.401294) + (0.12)(0.386668) \\approx -0.01203882 + 0.04640016 \\approx 0.03436134 \\, \\text{eV/atom} $$\n\nFor candidate $x_{B}$:\n$\\mu_{B} = -0.40$, $\\sigma_{B} = 0.05$.\nThe standardized improvement threshold is:\n$$ z_B = \\frac{f_{\\min} - \\mu_B}{\\sigma_B} = \\frac{-0.48 - (-0.40)}{0.05} = \\frac{-0.08}{0.05} = -1.6 $$\nThe Expected Improvement is:\n$$ \\mathrm{EI}(x_B) = (f_{\\min} - \\mu_B) \\Phi(z_B) + \\sigma_B \\phi(z_B) = (-0.08) \\Phi(-1.6) + (0.05) \\phi(-1.6) $$\nUsing standard normal distribution tables or a calculator:\n$\\Phi(-1.6) \\approx 0.054799$\n$\\phi(-1.6) = \\phi(1.6) \\approx 0.110921$\n$$ \\mathrm{EI}(x_B) \\approx (-0.08)(0.054799) + (0.05)(0.110921) \\approx -0.00438392 + 0.00554605 \\approx 0.00116213 \\, \\text{eV/atom} $$\n\nThe Expected Improvement criterion dictates selecting the candidate with the highest EI value. Comparing the two values:\n$$ \\mathrm{EI}(x_A) \\approx 0.03436 \\, \\text{eV/atom} $$\n$$ \\mathrm{EI}(x_B) \\approx 0.00116 \\, \\text{eV/atom} $$\nSince $\\mathrm{EI}(x_A) > \\mathrm{EI}(x_B)$, the candidate $x_{A}$ would be preferred. Although its mean prediction is worse than the current best ($ -0.45 > -0.48 $), its high uncertainty ($\\sigma_A = 0.12$) implies a significant probability of discovering a much lower formation energy. This choice represents exploration. In contrast, $x_B$ has low uncertainty and its mean ($ -0.40 $) is far from the current best, resulting in a very low expected improvement.\n\nFinally, we compute the difference $\\Delta = \\mathrm{EI}(x_{A}) - \\mathrm{EI}(x_{B})$:\n$$ \\Delta = 0.03436134 - 0.00116213 = 0.03319921 $$\nRounding this result to four significant figures gives $0.03320$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{0.03320}\n$$", "id": "2838007"}]}
