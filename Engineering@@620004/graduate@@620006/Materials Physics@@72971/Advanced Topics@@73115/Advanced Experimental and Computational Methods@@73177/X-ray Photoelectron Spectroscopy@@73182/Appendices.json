The measured photoelectron signals are integrated peak areas after a physically reasonable background subtraction, reported as total net counts summed over the energy channels comprising each peak. The oxygen $1s$ peak is integrated as a single component, while the titanium $2p$ signal is integrated as the sum of the $2p_{3/2}$ and $2p_{1/2}$ components over their full spin-orbit doublet envelope.\n\nAssume that, for a homogeneous semi-infinite solid, the depth-integrated photoemission intensity for core level $i$ is proportional to the near-surface atomic number density $n_{i}$ multiplied by the product of the photoionization cross section, the analyzer transmission function, and the effective attenuation factor; the product of these instrumental and atomic factors is operationally summarized by a relative sensitivity factor (RSF) $S_{i}$ supplied for the specific instrument and pass energy. You may assume $S_{i}$ is independent of composition for the present comparison and that the RSFs are known without uncertainty.

We may therefore proceed with the calculation.\n\nThe quantitative analysis of X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) data for a homogeneous sample relies on the relationship between the measured integrated peak area for an element's core level and its atomic concentration in the near-surface region. As stated in the problem, the integrated photoemission intensity $A_{i}$ corresponding to a core level $i$ is proportional to the atomic number density $n_{i}$ of the element and its relative sensitivity factor (RSF) $S_{i}$. This can be expressed as:\n$$A_{i} = k \\cdot n_{i} \\cdot S_{i}$$\nwhere $k$ is an instrumental proportionality constant, which is identical for all measurements performed under the same experimental conditions.\n\nFor the oxygen $\\mathrm{O}\\,1s$ peak and the titanium $\\mathrm{Ti}\\,2p$ doublet, we have:\n$$A_{\\mathrm{O}\\,1s} = k \\cdot n_{\\mathrm{O}} \\cdot S_{\\mathrm{O}\\,1s}$$\n$$A_{\\mathrm{Ti}\\,2p} = k \\cdot n_{\\mathrm{Ti}} \\cdot S_{\\mathrm{Ti}\\,2p}$$\n\nWe are tasked to compute the oxygen-to-titanium atomic ratio, defined as $R \\equiv n_{\\mathrm{O}}/n_{\\mathrm{Ti}}$. To find this ratio, we divide the equation for oxygen by the equation for titanium:\n$$\\frac{A_{\\mathrm{O}\\,1s}}{A_{\\mathrm{Ti}\\,2p}} = \\frac{k \\cdot n_{\\mathrm{O}} \\cdot S_{\\mathrm{O}\\,1s}}{k \\cdot n_{\\mathrm{Ti}} \\cdot S_{\\mathrm{Ti}\\,2p}}$$\nThe instrumental constant $k$ cancels out. Rearranging the expression to solve for $R$ yields:\n$$R = \\frac{n_{\\mathrm{O}}}{n_{\\mathrm{Ti}}} = \\frac{A_{\\mathrm{O}\\,1s}}{A_{\\mathrm{Ti}\\,2p}} \\cdot \\frac{S_{\\mathrm{Ti}\\,2p}}{S_{\\mathrm{O}\\,1s}}$$\n\nWe substitute the provided numerical values into this equation:\n- $A_{\\mathrm{O}\\,1s} = 4.00000 \\times 10^{5}$\n- $A_{\\mathrm{Ti}\\,2p} = 5.00000 \\times 10^{5}$\n- $S_{\\mathrm{O}\\,1s} = 0.800$\n- $S_{\\mathrm{Ti}\\,2p} = 2.000$\n\n$$R = \\frac{4.00000 \\times 10^{5}}{5.00000 \\times 10^{5}} \\cdot \\frac{2.000}{0.800} = 0.80000 \\times 2.500 = 2.000$$\nThe best-estimate value for the oxygen-to-titanium atomic ratio is $2.000$. This is consistent with the stoichiometry of titanium dioxide ($\\mathrm{TiO_2}$).\n\nNext, we must estimate the uncertainty in $R$, denoted $\\sigma_R$, arising from counting statistics. The problem states that the RSFs are exact constants, so the uncertainty in $R$ depends only on the uncertainties in the measured areas, $A_{\\mathrm{O}\\,1s}$ and $A_{\\mathrm{Ti}\\,2p}$. The variables $A_{\\mathrm{O}\\,1s}$ and $A_{\\mathrm{Ti}\\,2p}$ are independent. For a function of the form $f(x,y) = C \\cdot x/y$, the standard formula for propagation of uncertainties is:\n$$\\left(\\frac{\\sigma_f}{f}\\right)^2 = \\left(\\frac{\\sigma_x}{x}\\right)^2 + \\left(\\frac{\\sigma_y}{y}\\right)^2$$\nApplying this to our expression for $R$, where the ratio of RSFs is a constant, we get:\n$$\\left(\\frac{\\sigma_R}{R}\\right)^2 = \\left(\\frac{\\sigma_{A_{\\mathrm{O}\\,1s}}}{A_{\\mathrm{O}\\,1s}}\\right)^2 + \\left(\\frac{\\sigma_{A_{\\mathrm{Ti}\\,2p}}}{A_{\\mathrm{Ti}\\,2p}}\\right)^2$$\nThe problem specifies that the counting statistics for the net peak areas are governed by Poisson statistics. For a Poisson-distributed variable with a mean count of $N$, the variance is $\\sigma_N^2 = N$. Therefore, the variance of each net area is equal to the area itself:\n$$\\sigma_{A_{\\mathrm{O}\\,1s}}^2 = A_{\\mathrm{O}\\,1s}$$\n$$\\sigma_{A_{\\mathrm{Ti}\\,2p}}^2 = A_{\\mathrm{Ti}\\,2p}$$\nSubstituting these into the relative uncertainty propagation formula gives:\n$$\\frac{\\sigma_R^2}{R^2} = \\frac{A_{\\mathrm{O}\\,1s}}{A_{\\mathrm{O}\\,1s}^2} + \\frac{A_{\\mathrm{Ti}\\,2p}}{A_{\\mathrm{Ti}\\,2p}^2} = \\frac{1}{A_{\\mathrm{O}\\,1s}} + \\frac{1}{A_{\\mathrm{Ti}\\,2p}}$$\nNow we substitute the numerical values for the areas:\n$$\\frac{\\sigma_R^2}{R^2} = \\frac{1}{4.00000 \\times 10^{5}} + \\frac{1}{5.00000 \\times 10^{5}} = 2.5 \\times 10^{-6} + 2.0 \\times 10^{-6} = 4.5 \\times 10^{-6}$$\nThe absolute uncertainty $\\sigma_R$ is then:\n$$\\sigma_R = R \\cdot \\sqrt{4.5 \\times 10^{-6}} = 2.000 \\cdot \\sqrt{4.5} \\times 10^{-3}$$\nUsing $\\sqrt{4.5} \\approx 2.12132$:\n$$\\sigma_R \\approx 2.000 \\times 2.12132 \\times 10^{-3} \\approx 4.24264 \\times 10^{-3} = 0.00424264$$\nThe problem requires that the final values for $R$ and $\\sigma_R$ be rounded to three significant figures.\n- For $R = 2.000$, rounding to three significant figures gives $2.00$.\n- For $\\sigma_R = 0.00424264$, rounding to three significant figures gives $0.00424$.\n\nThus, the requested values are $R = 2.00$ and $\\sigma_R = 0.00424$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 2.00 & 0.00424 \\end{pmatrix}}$$", "id": "2871601"}, {"introduction": "XPS is an inherently surface-sensitive technique, a property that can be harnessed to perform non-destructive depth profiling of nanometer-scale structures.
