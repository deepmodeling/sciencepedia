It is self-contained, scientifically grounded, and well-posed. The provided data are consistent. We will proceed with the solution.\n\nThe problem asks for the expected number of neighbors, $N_c$, within a spherical cutoff radius $r_c$ for a tagged particle. We begin from the provided fundamental definition. The expected number of particles, $\\mathrm{d}N$, in an infinitesimal spherical shell of radius $r$ and thickness $\\mathrm{d}r$ centered on a tagged particle is given by the product of the local number density at that distance and the volume of the shell, $\\mathrm{d}V$.\n\nThe local number density at a distance $r$ is, by definition, $\\rho g(r)$.\nThe volume of the spherical shell is $\\mathrm{d}V = 4 \\pi r^2 \\mathrm{d}r$.\n\nTherefore, the differential number of neighbors is:\n$$\n\\mathrm{d}N = (\\rho g(r)) (4 \\pi r^2 \\mathrm{d}r)\n$$\nTo find the total expected number of neighbors $N_c$ within the cutoff radius $r_c$, we must integrate this expression from $r=0$ to $r=r_c$:\n$$\nN_c = \\int_{0}^{r_c} \\mathrm{d}N = \\int_{0}^{r_c} 4 \\pi \\rho g(r) r^2 \\mathrm{d}r\n$$\nThe problem states to assume an ideal-structure limit where the pair distribution function $g(r) = 1$ for the entire range of integration, $0 \\le r \\le r_c$. Substituting this condition into the integral:\n$$\nN_c = \\int_{0}^{r_c} 4 \\pi \\rho (1) r^2 \\mathrm{d}r\n$$\nSince the number density $\\rho$ is constant, we can move the term $4 \\pi \\rho$ outside the integral:\n$$\nN_c = 4 \\pi \\rho \\int_{0}^{r_c} r^2 \\mathrm{d}r\n$$\nThe integral of $r^2$ is $\\frac{r^3}{3}$.

I will therefore proceed with the solution.\n\nThe solution is divided into two parts as requested: first, the derivation from the provided foundations, and second, the numerical evaluation.\n\n**Part 1: Derivation of the Acceptance Probability**\n\nThe Metropolis algorithm ensures that the simulation samples from the desired equilibrium ensemble by enforcing the condition of detailed balance. For a transition from an old state, $o$, to a new state, $n$, the detailed balance equation is:\n$$ \\pi(o) T(o \\to n) = \\pi(n) T(n \\to o) $$\nwhere $\\pi(s)$ is the equilibrium probability of state $s$ and $T(o \\to n)$ is the transition probability. The transition probability is a product of the proposal probability, $g(o \\to n)$, and the acceptance probability, $A(o \\to n)$. The standard Metropolis choice for the acceptance probability is:\n$$ A(o \\to n) = \\min\\left(1, \\frac{\\pi(n) g(n \\to o)}{\\pi(o) g(o \\to n)}\\right) $$\nIn the isothermal-isobaric (NPT) ensemble, a microstate is defined by the particle coordinates $\\mathbf{r}^N = \\{\\mathbf{r}_1, \\dots, \\mathbf{r}_N\\}$ and the volume $V$. The problem specifies an isotropic volume change move where the simulation box, assumed to be cubic, changes volume from $V$ to $V'$, and all particle coordinates are scaled uniformly. This implies that the scaled coordinates, $\\mathbf{s}_i = V^{-1/3}\\mathbf{r}_i$, remain invariant during the move. Therefore, it is most convenient to define the state of the system by the set of scaled coordinates $\\mathbf{s}^N$ and the volume $V$. The trial move is then a transition from an old state $o = (\\mathbf{s}^N, V)$ to a new state $n = (\\mathbf{s}^N, V')$.\n\nThe problem states that the equilibrium configurational probability density is proportional to $\\exp[-\\beta(U+PV)]$. This probability density must be understood in the context of the variables used to define the state. The fundamental phase space volume element for the configurational degrees of freedom is $d\\mathbf{r}^N$. To express the probability density in terms of our chosen state variables $(\\mathbf{s}^N, V)$, we must perform a change of variables from $\\mathbf{r}^N$ to $\\mathbf{s}^N$. The differential volume element transforms as:\n$$ d\\mathbf{r}^N = \\prod_{i=1}^N d\\mathbf{r}_i = \\prod_{i=1}^N (V d\\mathbf{s}_i) = V^N d\\mathbf{s}^N $$\nThe factor $V^N$ is the Jacobian of this transformation, as given in the problem's foundation. The probability of finding the system in the infinitesimal phase space volume $d\\mathbf{s}^N dV$ around the state $(\\mathbf{s}^N, V)$ is therefore:\n$$ p_{eq}(\\mathbf{s}^N, V) d\\mathbf{s}^N dV \\propto \\exp[-\\beta(U(\\mathbf{r}^N(\\mathbf{s}^N,V)) + PV)] V^N d\\mathbf{s}^N dV $$\nThus, the equilibrium probability density, $\\pi(\\mathbf{s}^N, V)$, in the space of scaled coordinates and volume, is:\n$$ \\pi(\\mathbf{s}^N, V) \\propto V^N \\exp[-\\beta(U + PV)] $$\nThis expression explicitly incorporates the Boltzmann factor and the Jacobian factor $V^N$, as required by the problem's foundations.\n\nWe can now compute the ratio of equilibrium probabilities for the trial move $o \\to n$, where $o=(\\mathbf{s}^N, V)$ and $n=(\\mathbf{s}^N, V')$. The potential energy of the old state is $U = U(\\mathbf{r}^N)$ and that of the new state is $U' = U(\\mathbf{r}'^N)$.\n$$ \\frac{\\pi(n)}{\\pi(o)} = \\frac{\\pi(\\mathbf{s}^N, V')}{\\pi(\\mathbf{s}^N, V)} = \\frac{(V')^N \\exp[-\\beta(U' + PV')]}{V^N \\exp[-\\beta(U + PV)]} $$\nThis simplifies to:\n$$ \\frac{\\pi(n)}{\\pi(o)} = \\left(\\frac{V'}{V}\\right)^N \\exp[-\\beta((U' - U) + P(V' - V))] $$\nNext, we consider the ratio of proposal probabilities, $g(n \\to o)/g(o \\to n)$. The move is from $(\\mathbf{s}^N, V)$ to $(\\mathbf{s}^N, V')$, so the proposal is effectively for the volume, $g(V \\to V')$. The reverse move requires proposing $V$ from $V'$, $g(V' \\to V)$. The problem statement provides the explicit assumption that \"the forward and reverse proposal probabilities cancel\". This translates to:\n$$ \\frac{g(n \\to o)}{g(o \\to n)} = \\frac{g(V' \\to V)}{g(V \\to V')} = 1 $$\nSubstituting the probability ratios into the Metropolis acceptance formula, we obtain the expression for the acceptance probability of the volume-change move:\n$$ A(V \\to V') = \\min\\left(1, \\left(\\frac{V'}{V}\\right)^N \\exp[-\\beta((U' - U) + P(V' - V))]\\right) $$\nThis expression can be written more compactly by combining the terms inside the exponential function:\n$$ A(V \\to V') = \\min\\left(1, \\exp\\left[N\\ln\\left(\\frac{V'}{V}\\right) - \\beta(U' - U) - \\beta P(V' - V)\\right]\\right) $$\nThis is the final derived expression for the acceptance probability, founded upon the principles laid out in the problem statement. The Jacobian factor $V^N$ from the coordinate transformation manifests as the term $N\\ln(V'/V)$ in the argument of the exponential.\n\n**Part 2: Numerical Evaluation**\n\nFor the second task, we must compute the numerical value of this acceptance probability given the following parameters in reduced units:\n- Number of particles: $N = 108$\n- Current volume: $V = 1000$\n- Proposed volume: $V' = 1001$\n- External pressure: $P = 1.0$\n- Change in potential energy: $\\Delta U = U' - U = 0.5$\n- Inverse temperature: $\\beta = 1 / (k_B T) = 1$\n\nFirst, we calculate the change in volume, $\\Delta V$:\n$$ \\Delta V = V' - V = 1001 - 1000 = 1 $$\nLet us denote the argument of the exponential in the acceptance probability formula as $X$:\n$$ X = N\\ln\\left(\\frac{V'}{V}\\right) - \\beta(\\Delta U + P\\Delta V) $$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$ X = 108 \\ln\\left(\\frac{1001}{1000}\\right) - 1 \\times (0.5 + 1.0 \\times 1) $$\n$$ X = 108 \\ln(1.001) - 1.5 $$\nWe now compute the numerical value of $X$:\n$$ \\ln(1.001) \\approx 0.00099950033 $$\n$$ X \\approx 108 \\times 0.00099950033 - 1.5 $$\n$$ X \\approx 0.107946036 - 1.5 $$\n$$ X \\approx -1.392053964 $$\nThe acceptance probability is $A = \\min(1, \\exp(X))$.

In a simulation employing PBC in a cubic box of side length $L$, a particle interacts not only with its surroundings in the central cell but also with its own periodic images. The long-range nature of hydrodynamic interactions means that these image interactions do not decay sufficiently fast to be negligible.\n\nThe velocity of a tagged particle under the influence of an external force $\\mathbf{F}$ is the sum of its velocity in an infinite medium (related to the infinite-system mobility $\\mu_{\\infty}$) and the collective contribution from the flow fields generated by all its periodic images, which are also subject to the force $\\mathbf{F}$. The total velocity of the particle must also account for a uniform backflow that ensures the total momentum of the simulation cell remains zero. The effective mobility in the finite system of size $L$, denoted $\\mu_{L}$, is thus different from $\\mu_{\\infty}$. The correction, $\\Delta\\mu = \\mu_{L} - \\mu_{\\infty}$, arises from the sum of the Oseen tensor over the periodic lattice sites.\n\nA formal calculation, typically performed using the Ewald summation method to handle the conditionally convergent lattice sum, yields the leading-order correction to the mobility. For a single particle in a cubic periodic box, this correction is given by:\n$$\\mu_{L} = \\mu_{\\infty} - \\frac{\\xi}{6\\pi\\eta L}$$\nwhere $\\xi$ is the dimensionless Hasimoto constant for a cubic lattice, which accounts for the specific geometry of the periodic images. The term arises from the long-wavelength-$k$ divergence in the Fourier representation of the Oseen tensor.\n\nA simpler, dimensional argument supports this scaling. The correction to mobility, $\\Delta\\mu$, is a consequence of hydrodynamic interactions propagated through the viscous medium over the length scale of the system, $L$.
