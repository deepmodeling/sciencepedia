Consider an infinite one-dimensional chain with a basis of $2$ atoms per primitive cell: masses $m_1$ and $m_2$ alternate along the chain. The primitive lattice constant is $a$, and the nearest-neighbor separation between the basis atoms within a cell is $a/2$. Adjacent atoms are coupled by identical harmonic springs of force constant $K$. Let $u_n(t)$ and $v_n(t)$ denote the small longitudinal displacements (along the chain) of the $m_1$ and $m_2$ atoms in the $n$-th cell from their equilibrium positions.\n\nStarting only from Newtonâ€™s second law and the harmonic approximation for nearest-neighbor interactions, do the following:\n\n$1.$ Write down the equations of motion for $u_n(t)$ and $v_n(t)$ in terms of $K$, $m_1$, and $m_2$, using a harmonic potential energy that is quadratic in relative displacements of nearest neighbors and neglecting all other interactions.\n\n$2.$ Impose Bloch-form solutions $u_n(t)=U \\exp\\!\\big(i(q n a-\\omega t)\\big)$ and $v_n(t)=V \\exp\\!\\big(i(q n a-\\omega t)\\big)$, where $q$ is the crystal wavevector and $\\omega$ is the angular frequency, and derive the normal-mode eigenproblem of the form $\\mathbf{D}(q)\\,\\mathbf{e}=\\omega^2\\,\\mathbf{e}$, identifying the $2\\times 2$ dynamical matrix $\\mathbf{D}(q)$.\n\n$3.$ Evaluate the Brillouin-zone (BZ) center ($q=0$, the $\\Gamma$ point) optical-branch angular frequency $\\omega_{\\Gamma,\\mathrm{op}}$ in closed form.

All necessary parameters and conditions are provided for a unique and meaningful solution. The problem is therefore valid.\n\nThe solution proceeds by addressing the three specified tasks in sequence.\n\nFirst, we establish the geometry of the one-dimensional diatomic chain. Let the equilibrium position of the atom with mass $m_1$ in the $n$-th primitive cell be $x^{(0)}_{1,n} = na$. The equilibrium position of the atom with mass $m_2$ in the same cell is $x^{(0)}_{2,n} = na + a/2$. The displacements from these equilibrium positions are $u_n(t)$ and $v_n(t)$, respectively. So, the instantaneous positions are $x_{1,n}(t) = na + u_n(t)$ and $x_{2,n}(t) = na + a/2 + v_n(t)$.\n\nThe problem requires using a harmonic potential energy that is quadratic in the relative displacements of nearest neighbors. This is the harmonic approximation. For any two adjacent atoms $i$ and $i+1$ with equilibrium separation $d_{eq}$, the potential energy is $V_i = \\frac{1}{2}K(x_{i+1} - x_i - d_{eq})^2$. The force on atom $i$ from atom $i+1$ is $F_i = -\\frac{\\partial V_i}{\\partial x_i} = K(x_{i+1} - x_i - d_{eq})$. This is Hooke's law, with the force proportional to the extension of the spring from its equilibrium length.\n\n$1.$ Derivation of the Equations of Motion\n\nWe apply Newton's second law, $F=ma$, to each type of atom.\n\nAtom of mass $m_1$ in cell $n$: This atom is located at $x_{1,n}(t) = na + u_n(t)$. Its nearest neighbors are the atom of mass $m_2$ in cell $n$ (at $x_{2,n}(t) = na + a/2 + v_n(t)$) and the atom of mass $m_2$ in cell $n-1$ (at $x_{2,n-1}(t) = (n-1)a + a/2 + v_{n-1}(t)$). The equilibrium separation is $a/2$.\n\nThe force on atom $m_1$ from atom $m_2$ in cell $n$ is:\n$$ F_{1 \\leftarrow 2,n} = K [ (x_{2,n} - x_{1,n}) - a/2 ] = K [ (na + a/2 + v_n) - (na + u_n) - a/2 ] = K(v_n - u_n) $$\nThe force on atom $m_1$ from atom $m_2$ in cell $n-1$ is:\n$$ F_{1 \\leftarrow 2,n-1} = -K [ (x_{1,n} - x_{2,n-1}) - a/2 ] = -K [ (na + u_n) - ((n-1)a + a/2 + v_{n-1}) - a/2 ] = -K(u_n - v_{n-1}) $$\nThe total force on atom $m_1$ in cell $n$ is the sum of these two forces.

The objective is to determine the number of distinct infrared-active fundamental vibrational frequencies. This analysis will be conducted using the principles of group theory.\n\nFirst, we must determine the characters of the reducible representation, $\\Gamma_{3N}$, which describes the transformation properties of the $3N$ Cartesian displacement vectors of the $N=4$ atoms in the molecule. The character for a given symmetry operation, $\\chi(R)$, is calculated as the product of the number of atoms that remain unshifted by the operation, $U(R)$, and the character of the transformation of the $(x, y, z)$ coordinate system at each unshifted atom.\n\nLet us compute the characters for each class of operation in the $D_{3h}$ group. The total number of atoms is $N=4$ ($1$ B, $3$ F). The total degrees of freedom are $3N=12$.\n\n1.  **Identity, $E$**: All $4$ atoms are unshifted, so $U(E) = 4$. The identity operation leaves $(x, y, z)$ unchanged, represented by a $3 \\times 3$ identity matrix with a trace of $3$. Thus, $\\chi_{3N}(E) = 4 \\times 3 = 12$.\n\n2.  **Principal axis rotation, $C_3$**: Rotation by $120^\\circ$ about the $z$-axis. Only the central Boron atom is unshifted, so $U(C_3) = 1$. The transformation matrix for rotation by an angle $\\theta$ about the $z$-axis has a trace of $1 + 2\\cos\\theta$. For $C_3$, $\\theta = 120^\\circ$, so the trace is $1 + 2\\cos(120^\\circ) = 1 + 2(-\\frac{1}{2}) = 0$. Thus, $\\chi_{3N}(C_3) = 1 \\times 0 = 0$.\n\n3.  **Perpendicular $C_2$ rotation, $C_2'$**: Rotation by $180^\\circ$ about an axis passing through the Boron atom and one Fluorine atom. $U(C_2') = 2$. The trace of a $180^\\circ$ rotation is $1 + 2\\cos(180^\\circ) = 1 - 2 = -1$. Thus, $\\chi_{3N}(C_2') = 2 \\times (-1) = -2$.\n\n4.  **Horizontal reflection, $\\sigma_h$**: Reflection through the molecular ($xy$) plane. All $4$ atoms lie in this plane and are unshifted, so $U(\\sigma_h) = 4$. Reflection through the $xy$-plane transforms $(x, y, z)$ to $(x, y, -z)$, for which the transformation matrix has a trace of $1 + 1 - 1 = 1$. Thus, $\\chi_{3N}(\\sigma_h) = 4 \\times 1 = 4$.\n\n5.  **Improper rotation, $S_3$**: A $C_3$ rotation followed by a $\\sigma_h$ reflection. Only the central Boron atom is unshifted, so $U(S_3) = 1$. The trace for an $S_n$ operation is $-1 + 2\\cos(2\\pi/n)$. For $S_3$, this is $-1 + 2\\cos(120^\\circ) = -1 - 1 = -2$. Thus, $\\chi_{3N}(S_3) = 1 \\times (-2) = -2$.\n\n6.  **Vertical reflection, $\\sigma_v$**: Reflection through a plane containing the principal axis and a B-F bond. This plane contains the Boron atom and one Fluorine atom, so $U(\\sigma_v) = 2$. Such a reflection transforms $(x, y, z)$ to $(x, -y, z)$ (if the plane is $xz$), with a trace of $1 - 1 + 1 = 1$.

The total dimensionality is $1+1+3(2)+2(1)+1(2) = 12$, which matches $3N$.\n\nThe $3N$ degrees of freedom include overall translation and rotation of the molecule. We must subtract the representations for these motions to find the vibrational representation, $\\Gamma_{\\text{vib}}$.\nThe translational modes transform as the Cartesian coordinates $(x,y,z)$. From the problem statement, $(x,y)$ transform as $E'$ and $z$ transforms as $A_2''$. Therefore, $\\Gamma_{\\text{trans}} = E' + A_2''$.\nThe rotational modes for a non-linear molecule transform as rotations about the axes, $(R_x, R_y, R_z)$. For the $D_{3h}$ point group, $R_z$ transforms as $A_2'$ and the degenerate pair $(R_x, R_y)$ transforms as $E''$. Therefore, $\\Gamma_{\\text{rot}} = A_2' + E''$.\n\nThe vibrational representation is $\\Gamma_{\\text{vib}} = \\Gamma_{3N} - \\Gamma_{\\text trans} - \\Gamma_{\\text rot}$:\n$$ \\Gamma_{\\text{vib}} = (A_1' + A_2' + 3E' + 2A_2'' + E'') - (E' + A_2'') - (A_2' + E'')$$\n$$ \\Gamma_{\\text{vib}} = A_1' + (3-1)E' + (2-1)A_2'' = A_1' + 2E' + A_2'' $$\nThe number of vibrational modes is the sum of the dimensions of these irreducible representations: $1 + 2(2) + 1 = 6$, which correctly matches the formula $3N-6=3(4)-6=6$ for a non-linear molecule.\n\nA vibrational mode is infrared (IR)-active if its irreducible representation transforms as one of the Cartesian coordinates $x$, $y$, or $z$. The problem states that $x,y$ transform as $E'$ and $z$ transforms as $A_2''$.\nOur vibrational modes are $A_1'$, two distinct modes of symmetry $E'$, and one mode of symmetry $A_2''$.\n-   The $A_1'$ mode is IR-inactive.\n-   The $A_2''$ mode is IR-active.\n-   The two $E'$ modes are IR-active.\n\nThe question asks for the total number of distinct infrared-active fundamental vibrational frequencies. The decomposition $\\Gamma_{\\text{vib}} = A_1' + 2E' + A_2''$ indicates there are four fundamental vibrations in total. One of type $A_1'$, one of type $A_2''$, and two distinct vibrations both of type $E'$. These two $E'$ modes will in general have different frequencies.\nThe IR-active vibrations are:\n- One non-degenerate mode of symmetry $A_2''$. This corresponds to one fundamental frequency.\n- Two doubly-degenerate modes of symmetry $E'$. Each of these corresponds to a distinct fundamental frequency.\nThe parenthetical \"(count each degenerate irreducible representation once)\" is interpreted to mean that a single degenerate mode, such as an $E'$ mode, accounts for one frequency, not a number of frequencies equal to its dimension. This is standard. Since our analysis yields two distinct modes of $E'$ symmetry, there are two distinct frequencies associated with this symmetry type.\nIn total, there is one frequency from the $A_2''$ mode and two frequencies from the two $E'$ modes.\nThe total number of distinct infrared-active fundamental vibrational frequencies is therefore $1 + 2 = 3$.\n\nFor completeness, we identify the Raman-active modes. A mode is Raman-active if its symmetry is shared with a quadratic basis function. The problem provides $A_1'$ and $E'$ as Raman-active symmetries.\n- $A_1'$: IR-inactive, Raman-active.\n- $A_2''$: IR-active, Raman-inactive.\n- $E'$: IR-active, Raman-active.\nThe molecule exhibits mutual exclusion for the non-degenerate modes ($A_1'$ is Raman-only, $A_2''$ is IR-only), which is a consequence of the center of inversion implicitly present in the $D_{nh}$ groups (e.g. via $S_2 = i$).

The sample is rotated about the surface normal $\\hat{z}$ by an angle $\\phi$ (in radians), while the laboratory polarizations remain fixed.\n\nStarting from first principles appropriate to light scattering by an induced dipole and the transformation law for second-rank tensors under rotations, derive the analytic dependence of the scattered intensity on $\\phi$. Express your final result as the intensity normalized to its maximum value, as a single closed-form function of $\\phi$ (in radians). No numerical rounding is required, and no physical units should be used because the intensity is normalized.", "solution": "The problem asks for the scattered Raman intensity as a function of the sample rotation angle $\\phi$, normalized to its maximum value. The solution requires applying the principles of Raman scattering and the rules for transforming second-rank tensors under rotation.\n\nThe scattered Raman intensity, $I_s$, is proportional to the squared magnitude of the projection of the induced electric dipole moment onto the scattered light's polarization direction. The induced dipole moment for Raman scattering is generated by the interaction of the incident electric field with the vibrational mode, mediated by the Raman polarizability tensor $\\boldsymbol{R}$. This relationship is expressed as:\n$$\nI_s \\propto |\\mathbf{e}_s^{\\top} \\boldsymbol{R} \\mathbf{e}_i|^2\n$$\nwhere $\\mathbf{e}_i$ is the polarization vector of the incident light, $\\mathbf{e}_s$ is the polarization vector of the analyzed scattered light, and $\\boldsymbol{R}$ is the Raman tensor. All three quantities must be expressed in the same coordinate frame.\n\nThe problem provides the Raman tensor $\\boldsymbol{R}_{\\mathrm{crystal}}$ in the crystal's principal axis frame and the polarization vectors $\\mathbf{e}_i$ and $\\mathbf{e}_s$ in the fixed laboratory frame. To calculate the intensity, we must transform the Raman tensor into the laboratory frame.\n\nThe crystal is rotated by an angle $\\phi$ about the laboratory $\\hat{z}$ axis, which is normal to the sample surface. We assume that at $\\phi=0$, the crystal axes $(x', y', z')$ are aligned with the laboratory axes $(x, y, z)$. A rotation of the crystal by an angle $\\phi$ about the $\\hat{z}$ axis is described by the rotation matrix $\\boldsymbol{M}(\\phi)$:\n$$\n\\boldsymbol{M}(\\phi) = \\begin{pmatrix}\n\\cos\\phi & -\\sin\\phi & 0 \\\\\n\\sin\\phi & \\cos\\phi & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 1\n\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThis matrix transforms the components of a vector from the crystal's (rotated) frame to the laboratory (fixed) frame.\n\nA second-rank tensor $\\boldsymbol{T}$ transforms from a frame $A$ to a frame $B$ via the rotation $\\boldsymbol{M}$ (which rotates frame $A$'s basis vectors to frame $B$'s basis vectors) according to the law $\\boldsymbol{T}_B = \\boldsymbol{M} \\boldsymbol{T}_A \\boldsymbol{M}^{\\top}$. In our case, the Raman tensor in the laboratory frame, $\\boldsymbol{R}_{\\mathrm{lab}}$, is obtained from the tensor in the crystal frame, $\\boldsymbol{R}_{\\mathrm{crystal}}$, by the transformation:\n$$\n\\boldsymbol{R}_{\\mathrm{lab}}(\\phi) = \\boldsymbol{M}(\\phi) \\boldsymbol{R}_{\\mathrm{crystal}} \\boldsymbol{M}(\\phi)^{\\top}\n$$\nThe given Raman tensor in the crystal frame is:\n$$\n\\boldsymbol{R}_{\\mathrm{crystal}} = \\begin{pmatrix}\nr & 0 & 0 \\\\\n0 & -r & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 0\n\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nNow, we perform the matrix multiplication. First, we compute $\\boldsymbol{M}(\\phi) \\boldsymbol{R}_{\\mathrm{crystal}}$:\n$$\n\\boldsymbol{M}(\\phi) \\boldsymbol{R}_{\\mathrm{crystal}} = \\begin{pmatrix}\n\\cos\\phi & -\\sin\\phi & 0 \\\\\n\\sin\\phi & \\cos\\phi & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 1\n\\end{pmatrix}\n\\begin{pmatrix}\nr & 0 & 0 \\\\\n0 & -r & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 0\n\\end{pmatrix}\n= \\begin{pmatrix}\nr\\cos\\phi & r\\sin\\phi & 0 \\\\\nr\\sin\\phi & -r\\cos\\phi & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 0\n\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nNext, we multiply this result by $\\boldsymbol{M}(\\phi)^{\\top}$:\n$$\n\\boldsymbol{M}(\\phi)^{\\top} = \\begin{pmatrix}\n\\cos\\phi & \\sin\\phi & 0 \\\\\n-\\sin\\phi & \\cos\\phi & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 1\n\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\n$$\n\\boldsymbol{R}_{\\mathrm{lab}}(\\phi) = \\begin{pmatrix}\nr\\cos\\phi & r\\sin\\phi & 0 \\\\\nr\\sin\\phi & -r\\cos\\phi & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 0\n\\end{pmatrix}\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n\\cos\\phi & \\sin\\phi & 0 \\\\\n-\\sin\\phi & \\cos\\phi & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 1\n\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe elements of the resulting matrix are:\n$$\n(\\boldsymbol{R}_{\\mathrm{lab}})_{11} = (r\\cos\\phi)(\\cos\\phi) + (r\\sin\\phi)(-\\sin\\phi) = r(\\cos^2\\phi - \\sin^2\\phi) = r\\cos(2\\phi)\n$$\n$$\n(\\boldsymbol{R}_{\\mathrm{lab}})_{12} = (r\\cos\\phi)(\\sin\\phi) + (r\\sin\\phi)(\\cos\\phi) = 2r\\sin\\phi\\cos\\phi = r\\sin(2\\phi)\n$$\n$$\n(\\boldsymbol{R}_{\\mathrm{lab}})_{21} = (r\\sin\\phi)(\\cos\\phi) + (-r\\cos\\phi)(-\\sin\\phi) = 2r\\sin\\phi\\cos\\phi = r\\sin(2\\phi)\n$$\n$$\n(\\boldsymbol{R}_{\\mathrm{lab}})_{22} = (r\\sin\\phi)(\\sin\\phi) + (-r\\cos\\phi)(\\cos\\phi) = r(\\sin^2\\phi - \\cos^2\\phi) = -r\\cos(2\\phi)\n$$\nAll other elements are zero.
