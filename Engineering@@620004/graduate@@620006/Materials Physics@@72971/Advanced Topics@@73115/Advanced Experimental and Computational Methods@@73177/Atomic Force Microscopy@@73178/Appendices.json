A complete solution will be provided.\n\n**Derivation of Static Tip Stiffness ($k$)**\n\nThe static deflection $w(x)$ of an Euler–Bernoulli beam under a point load $F$ applied at the free tip ($x=L$) is found by solving the governing equation $EI \\frac{d^4 w}{dx^4} = 0$ for the domain $0 \\le x \\le L$, subject to the boundary conditions for a clamped-free beam.\nThe boundary conditions are:\n1.  Zero deflection at the clamped end ($x=0$): $w(0) = 0$.\n2.  Zero slope at the clamped end ($x=0$): $\\frac{dw}{dx}(0) = 0$.\n3.  Zero bending moment at the free end ($x=L$): $M(L) = EI \\frac{d^2 w}{dx^2}(L) = 0$.\n4.  Shear force equals the applied load at the free end ($x=L$): $V(L) = EI \\frac{d^3 w}{dx^3}(L) = F$.\n\nIntegrating the governing equation four times and applying the boundary conditions sequentially:\n$EI \\frac{d^3 w}{dx^3} = C_1$. From condition $4$, $C_1 = F$.\n$EI \\frac{d^2 w}{dx^2} = Fx + C_2$. From condition $3$, $FL + C_2 = 0 \\implies C_2 = -FL$.\n$EI \\frac{dw}{dx} = \\frac{1}{2}Fx^2 - FLx + C_3$. From condition $2$, $C_3 = 0$.\n$EI w(x) = \\frac{1}{6}Fx^3 - \\frac{1}{2}FLx^2 + C_4$. From condition $1$, $C_4 = 0$.\nThe deflection profile is thus $w(x) = \\frac{F}{EI} \\left(\\frac{x^3}{6} - \\frac{Lx^2}{2}\\right)$.\nThe tip deflection, $\\delta$, is the value of $w(x)$ at $x=L$:\n$\\delta = w(L) = \\frac{F}{EI} \\left(\\frac{L^3}{6} - \\frac{L^3}{2}\\right) = -\\frac{FL^3}{3EI}$.\nThe magnitude of the deflection is $|\\delta|=\\frac{FL^3}{3EI}$. Static stiffness is defined as $k = \\frac{F}{|\\delta|}$.\n$$k = \\frac{3EI}{L^3}$$\nFor a rectangular cross-section of width $b$ and thickness $t$, the second moment of area for bending about the axis parallel to the width is $I = \\frac{bt^3}{12}$.\n\n**Derivation of Fundamental Resonance Frequency ($f_0$)**\n\nThe equation for free transverse vibration of an Euler-Bernoulli beam is:\n$EI \\frac{\\partial^4 w(x,t)}{\\partial x^4} + \\rho A \\frac{\\partial^2 w(x,t)}{\\partial t^2} = 0$, where $\\rho$ is the material density and $A=bt$ is the cross-sectional area.\nUsing separation of variables, $w(x,t) = W(x)T(t)$, the spatial part of the equation becomes:\n$\\frac{d^4 W(x)}{dx^4} - \\beta^4 W(x) = 0$, where $\\beta^4 = \\frac{\\rho A \\omega^2}{EI}$ and $\\omega$ is the angular frequency of vibration.\nThe general solution for $W(x)$ is $W(x) = C_1 \\cosh(\\beta x) + C_2 \\sinh(\\beta x) + C_3 \\cos(\\beta x) + C_4 \\sin(\\beta x)$.\nApplying the clamped-free boundary conditions for free vibration ($W(0)=0$, $W'(0)=0$, $W''(L)=0$, $W'''(L)=0$) yields a non-trivial solution only if the determinant of the system's matrix is zero. This leads to the characteristic equation:\n$$\\cosh(\\beta L) \\cos(\\beta L) = -1$$\nThis transcendental equation gives an infinite set of discrete values for $\\beta_n L$. The fundamental mode corresponds to the first (smallest positive) solution, denoted by $\\lambda_1 = \\beta_1 L$. Numerically, its value is:\n$\\lambda_1 \\approx 1.875104$.\nFrom the definition of $\\beta$, we have $\\omega_0^2 = \\beta_1^4 \\frac{EI}{\\rho A} = \\frac{\\lambda_1^4}{L^4} \\frac{EI}{\\rho A}$.\nThe fundamental angular frequency is $\\omega_0 = \\frac{\\lambda_1^2}{L^2}\\sqrt{\\frac{EI}{\\rho A}}$.\nThe fundamental resonance frequency $f_0$ is $\\frac{\\omega_0}{2\\pi}$.\n$$f_0 = \\frac{\\lambda_1^2}{2 \\pi L^2} \\sqrt{\\frac{EI}{\\rho A}}$$\n\n**Numerical Evaluation**\n\nFirst, convert all given parameters to base SI units:\n$E = 170 \\times 10^9\\ \\mathrm{Pa}$\n$\\rho = 2330\\ \\mathrm{kg/m^3}$\n$L = 200 \\times 10^{-6}\\ \\mathrm{m}$\n$b = 30 \\times 10^{-6}\\ \\mathrm{m}$\n$t = 3 \\times 10^{-6}\\ \\mathrm{m}$\n\nCalculate the second moment of area $I$ and cross-sectional area $A$:\n$I = \\frac{bt^3}{12} = \\frac{(30 \\times 10^{-6}\\ \\mathrm{m})(3 \\times 10^{-6}\\ \\mathrm{m})^3}{12} = 6.75 \\times 10^{-23}\\ \\mathrm{m^4}$.\n$A = bt = (30 \\times 10^{-6}\\ \\mathrm{m})(3 \\times 10^{-6}\\ \\mathrm{m}) = 9 \\times 10^{-11}\\ \\mathrm{m^2}$.\n\nCalculation of $k$:\n$k = \\frac{3EI}{L^3} = \\frac{3(170 \\times 10^9\\ \\mathrm{Pa})(6.75 \\times 10^{-23}\\ \\mathrm{m^4})}{(200 \\times 10^{-6}\\ \\mathrm{m})^3} = \\frac{3.4425 \\times 10^{-11}\\ \\mathrm{N \\cdot m^2}}{8 \\times 10^{-12}\\ \\mathrm{m^3}} = 4.303125\\ \\mathrm{N/m}$.\nRounding to four significant figures, $k = 4.303\\ \\mathrm{N/m}$.\n\nCalculation of $f_0$:\n$f_0 = \\frac{(1.875104)^2}{2 \\pi (200 \\times 10^{-6}\\ \\mathrm{m})^2} \\sqrt{\\frac{(170 \\times 10^9\\ \\mathrm{Pa})(6.75 \\times 10^{-23}\\ \\mathrm{m^4})}{(2330\\ \\mathrm{kg/m^3})(9 \\times 10^{-11}\\ \\mathrm{m^2})}}$.\n$f_0 = \\frac{3.516015}{2 \\pi (4 \\times 10^{-8}\\ \\mathrm{m^2})} \\sqrt{\\frac{1.1475 \\times 10^{-11}\\ \\mathrm{N \\cdot m^2}}{2.097 \\times 10^{-7}\\ \\mathrm{kg/m}}}$.\n$f_0 \\approx \\frac{3.516015}{2.51327 \\times 10^{-7}\\ \\mathrm{m^2}} \\sqrt{5.4721 \\times 10^{-5}\\ \\mathrm{m^4/s^2}}$.\n$f_0 \\approx (1.3990 \\times 10^7\\ \\mathrm{m^{-2}}) (7.39736 \\times 10^{-3}\\ \\mathrm{m^2/s}) \\approx 103488\\ \\mathrm{s^{-1}} = 103488\\ \\mathrm{Hz}$.\nConverting to kilohertz, $f_0 \\approx 103.488\\ \\mathrm{kHz}$.\nRounding to four significant figures, $f_0 = 103.5\\ \\mathrm{kHz}$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 4.303 & 103.5 \\end{pmatrix}}\n$$", "id": "2801579"}, {"introduction": "AFM's ability to map surfaces relies on detecting the forces between the tip and sample, where the van der Waals interaction is often dominant at short distances.

A complete solution will be provided.\n\nThe objective is to derive the force $F(R,d,A)$ between the spherical tip and the planar surface. We are instructed to use the Derjaguin approximation, which is valid for $d \\ll R$. This approximation relates the force $F(d)$ between two curved surfaces to the interaction energy per unit area, $W_{p-p}(d)$, between two parallel flat plates of the same materials separated by a distance $d$. For a sphere of radius $R$ interacting with a flat plane, the force is given by:\n$$ F(d) = 2 \\pi R W_{p-p}(d) $$\nOur first task is to determine $W_{p-p}(d)$. This is the energy of interaction per unit area for two semi-infinite half-spaces, one of material $1$ (tip) and one of material $2$ (surface), separated by a vacuum gap of thickness $d$.
