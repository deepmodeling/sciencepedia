The wedge geometry is a common and practical scenario.\n- **Well-Posedness**: The problem provides sufficient information to qualitatively analyze the contrast mechanisms.

This represents a slight, linear change in defocus, which is physically plausible for a tilted wedge. The approximations invoked (WPOA, first-order absorption) are standard, though the validity of WPOA will be checked. The setup is internally consistent and physically feasible.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is scientifically sound, self-contained, and well-posed. The validation is passed. A solution will be derived.\n\n### Derivation of Solution\nThe intensity in a bright-field TEM image of a weak object is given by the interference of the unscattered wave with the scattered wave. The object transmission function, $q(\\mathbf{r})$, for a weak object imparting both phase and amplitude changes can be written as $q(\\mathbf{r}) \\approx 1 + i\\phi(\\mathbf{r}) - \\mu(\\mathbf{r})$, where $\\phi(\\mathbf{r})$ is the phase shift and $\\mu(\\mathbf{r})$ is the amplitude attenuation.\n\nThe image intensity contrast $\\delta I(\\mathbf{r})/I_0 = (I(\\mathbf{r}) - I_0)/I_0$ can be expressed in terms of the Fourier transforms of the phase and amplitude components, modulated by the microscope's transfer functions:\n$$\n\\frac{\\delta I(\\mathbf{r})}{I_0} \\approx -2\\mathcal{F}^{-1}[\\mathcal{F}\\{\\phi(\\mathbf{r})\\} \\sin(\\chi(k))] - 2\\mathcal{F}^{-1}[\\mathcal{F}\\{\\mu(\\mathbf{r})\\} \\cos(\\chi(k))]\n$$\nwhere $\\mathcal{F}$ and $\\mathcal{F}^{-1}$ denote Fourier and inverse Fourier transforms, $k$ is the spatial frequency, and $\\chi(k)$ is the wave aberration function. The first term represents phase contrast, and the second represents amplitude contrast.\n\nThe wave aberration function is given by:\n$$\n\\chi(k) = \\pi \\lambda \\left( \\frac{1}{2} C_s \\lambda^2 k^4 - \\Delta f k^2 \\right)\n$$\nHere, $\\lambda$ is the relativistic electron wavelength. For $V_{acc} = 300\\,\\mathrm{keV}$:\n$$\n\\lambda = \\frac{h}{\\sqrt{2m_0 E_k (1 + \\frac{E_k}{2m_0c^2})}} \\approx 1.968 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{nm}\n$$\nThe problem specifies a \"thin, amorphous wedge-shaped specimen\" where thickness varies linearly over a large field of view ($L=2\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}$). This \"slowly varying\" structure corresponds to very low spatial frequencies. The dominant spatial frequency $k_w$ associated with the wedge itself is on the order of $k_w \\sim 1/L = 1/(2000\\,\\mathrm{nm}) = 5 \\times 10^{-4}\\,\\mathrm{nm}^{-1}$.\n\nWe must analyze the behavior of the two contrast mechanisms at these very low spatial frequencies.\n\n**1. Phase Contrast Analysis:**\nThe phase contrast is governed by the Phase Contrast Transfer Function (PCTF), which is $A(k) = \\sin(\\chi(k))$. For very small $k$, the $C_s$ term ($k^4$) is negligible compared to the defocus term ($k^2$).\n$$\n\\chi(k) \\approx -\\pi \\lambda \\Delta f k^2\n$$\nSince $k$ is very small, the argument $\\chi(k)$ is also very small. We can use the small-angle approximation $\\sin(x) \\approx x$:\n$$\nPCTF(k) = \\sin(\\chi(k)) \\approx \\chi(k) \\approx -\\pi \\lambda \\Delta f k^2\n$$\nThe crucial point is that the PCTF is proportional to $k^2$. As spatial frequency $k \\to 0$, the PCTF goes to zero very rapidly. This means that very slowly varying phase structures, such as the overall shape of the wedge, are transferred with extremely low efficiency. Phase contrast is effective for high-frequency details (e.g., atomic columns, fine particles) but not for large-scale, slow variations in projected potential. Therefore, the phase contrast contribution from the slowly varying thickness gradient will be negligible.\n\n**2. Amplitude Contrast Analysis:**\nThe amplitude contrast is governed by the Amplitude Contrast Transfer Function (ACTF), which is $C(k) = \\cos(\\chi(k))$. For very small $k$, with $\\chi(k) \\approx 0$, we have:\n$$\nACTF(k) = \\cos(\\chi(k)) \\approx 1\n$$\nThis means that slowly varying amplitude structures are transferred with high efficiency, close to $100\\%$. The amplitude attenuation in the specimen is due to inelastic scattering, which removes electrons from the elastic beam. To first order, the attenuation function is $\\mu(x) = t(x)/(2\\lambda_{\\mathrm{inel}})$. The image intensity contribution from amplitude contrast is therefore:\n$$\n\\left(\\frac{\\delta I(x)}{I_0}\\right)_{\\text{amp}} \\approx -2\\mathcal{F}^{-1}[\\mathcal{F}\\{\\mu(x)\\} \\cdot 1] = -2\\mu(x) = -2 \\frac{t(x)}{2\\lambda_{\\mathrm{inel}}} = -\\frac{t(x)}{\\lambda_{\\mathrm{inel}}}\n$$\nThe specimen thickness $t(x)$ increases linearly from $10\\,\\mathrm{nm}$ to $30\\,\\mathrm{nm}$. The inelastic mean free path is $\\lambda_{\\mathrm{inel}} = 150\\,\\mathrm{nm}$.\n- At the thin end ($x=0$), the intensity drop is $t/\\lambda_{\\mathrm{inel}} = 10/150 \\approx 0.067$ (or $6.7\\%$).\n- At the thick end ($x=2\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}$), the intensity drop is $t/\\lambda_{\\mathrm{inel}} = 30/150 = 0.2$ (or $20\\%$).\nThis intensity variation is significant and certainly not negligible. Since the intensity drop is proportional to thickness, the image will show a monotonic darkening toward the thicker side of the wedge. This is the well-known mass-thickness contrast.\n\n**3. Effect of Defocus Gradient:**\nThe defocus varies linearly from $\\Delta f = -50\\,\\mathrm{nm}$ to $\\Delta f = -40\\,\\mathrm{nm}$. This is a very small variation. It slightly changes the coefficient of the $k^2$ term in the PCTF, but since the PCTF is already negligible at the relevant low spatial frequencies, this change has no significant effect. The ACTF, $\\cos(-\\pi \\lambda \\Delta f k^2)$, remains extremely close to $1$ over this range of $\\Delta f$ for small $k$. Thus, the defocus gradient has a negligible impact on the overall intensity trend.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n- **A) The image will show a monotonic brightening toward the thicker side because, at slight underfocus, the low spatial frequency components of the projected potential are transferred with a sign that makes larger phase shifts appear brighter; the defocus gradient is too small to change this trend.**\n  - **Incorrect**. Firstly, for a weak phase object which is a potential well ($V_0 > 0$), underfocus imaging ($\\Delta f < 0$) produces dark contrast, not bright contrast. The statement about the sign is incorrect. Secondly, and more fundamentally, phase contrast is negligible for such a slowly varying object because the PCTF approaches zero for low spatial frequencies.\n\n- **B) The image will show a monotonic darkening toward the thicker side because the slowly varying thickness gradient resides at spatial frequencies so low that the phase-contrast transfer is negligibly small; thus absorption (mass–thickness contrast) dominates. The defocus gradient only weakly perturbs low-frequency transfer and cannot invert this monotonic trend at the given parameters.**\n  - **Correct**. This statement accurately reflects the analysis. The intensity variation is a monotonic darkening due to mass-thickness contrast ($I \\propto -t(x)$). This mechanism dominates because phase contrast is suppressed for low spatial frequencies ($PCTF \\propto k^2 \\to 0$). The absorption effect is shown to be significant. The defocus gradient is correctly identified as having a negligible effect.\n\n- **C) The image intensity will oscillate multiple times between bright and dark across the field because the local defocus gradient drives the CTF phase through several zeros at the wedge’s spatial frequency, repeatedly flipping the contrast of the slowly varying thickness.**\n  - **Incorrect**. Oscillations require the argument of the CTF, $\\chi(k)$, to pass through multiples of $\\pi$. For the extremely low spatial frequency $k_w \\sim 5 \\times 10^{-4}\\,\\mathrm{nm}^{-1}$ of the wedge, the value of $\\chi(k_w) \\approx -\\pi \\lambda \\Delta f k_w^2$ is of the order of $10^{-7}$, which is orders of magnitude smaller than $\\pi$. The small defocus gradient cannot cause any such oscillations. This option incorrectly describes a phenomenon (like Fresnel fringes or Thon rings) that does not apply to the slow variation of the entire object.\n\n- **D) The image intensity will remain essentially uniform because both thickness and defocus gradients are slowly varying phase objects that are not transferred by the CTF at low spatial frequency, and absorption is negligible over the stated thickness range.**\n  - **Incorrect**. While it is correct that the phase component of the slowly varying object is not well-transferred, the conclusion is wrong because it falsely claims that absorption is negligible. The calculation shows an intensity drop of up to $20\\%$, which is a strong, observable contrast. The image will not be uniform.\n\nFinal conclusion is that mass-thickness contrast is the dominant effect, leading to a monotonic darkening towards the thicker side of the specimen.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2867939"}, {"introduction": "In scanning electron microscopy, the spatial resolution is not simply the size of the electron probe, but is critically governed by the extent of the interaction volume within the solid sample.

It presents a simplified but coherent physical model of electron interaction within a solid, suitable for analysis. All required data and assumptions are explicitly provided. We may therefore proceed directly to the solution.\n\nThe problem is divided into two parts. First, we must derive a scaling law. Second, we apply this law using provided calibration data to find numerical estimates.\n\nPart 1: Derivation of the scaling law for the lateral interaction radius $r$.\n\nWe are given three core assumptions:\n1. The lateral interaction radius $r$ is directly proportional to the mean projected penetration range $R$. This can be written as $r = C_r R$, where $C_r$ is a proportionality factor assumed to be independent of beam energy $E_0$ and mass density $\\rho$.\n2. The mean projected penetration range $R$ is defined by the integral over the inverse of the stopping power, within the continuous slowing down approximation (CSDA):\n$$R = \\int_{0}^{E_0} \\mathrm{d}E \\, \\left|\\frac{\\mathrm{d}E}{\\mathrm{d}x}\\right|^{-1}$$\n3. The electronic stopping power is given by the functional form $\\left|\\frac{\\mathrm{d}E}{\\mathrm{d}x}\\right| \\propto \\rho \\, E^{-m}$, where $\\rho$ is the mass density and $m$ is a material-independent constant given as $m \\approx 0.67$. We can write this as $\\left|\\frac{\\mathrm{d}E}{\\mathrm{d}x}\\right| = C_s \\rho E^{-m}$, where $C_s$ is another proportionality constant.\n\nWe begin by substituting the expression for the stopping power into the definition of the range $R$.\n$$R = \\int_{0}^{E_0} (C_s \\rho E^{-m})^{-1} \\mathrm{d}E$$\nThe term $(C_s \\rho)^{-1}$ is constant with respect to the integration variable $E$, so it can be moved outside the integral.\n$$R = \\frac{1}{C_s \\rho} \\int_{0}^{E_0} E^{m} \\mathrm{d}E$$\nThe integral of $E^m$ is a standard power rule integration.\n$$R = \\frac{1}{C_s \\rho} \\left[ \\frac{E^{m+1}}{m+1} \\right]_{0}^{E_0}$$\nEvaluating the expression at the limits of integration, from $0$ to $E_0$:\n$$R = \\frac{1}{C_s \\rho (m+1)} (E_0^{m+1} - 0^{m+1})$$\nSince the exponent is given as $m \\approx 0.67$, we have $m+1 \\approx 1.67 > 0$, and thus $0^{m+1} = 0$. The expression for the range $R$ simplifies to:\n$$R = \\frac{1}{C_s(m+1)} \\frac{E_0^{m+1}}{\\rho}$$\nNow, we use the first assumption, $r = C_r R$, to find the dependence of $r$ on $E_0$ and $\\rho$.\n$$r = C_r \\left( \\frac{1}{C_s(m+1)} \\frac{E_0^{m+1}}{\\rho} \\right)$$\nWe can group all the constant terms into a single multiplicative constant, $k$. Let $k = \\frac{C_r}{C_s(m+1)}$. The problem states that $C_r$ is independent of $E_0$ and $\\rho$. While $C_s$ might have some material dependence (e.g., on atomic number $Z$ and atomic mass $A$), the problem asks us to find the functional dependence on $E_0$ and $\\rho$ only, and later states that the proportionality factor (implying the entire prefactor $k$) can be treated as composition-independent for the purpose of calibration. Thus, we define $k$ as a constant independent of $E_0$ and $\\rho$.\nThe resulting scaling law is:\n$$r = k \\frac{E_0^{m+1}}{\\rho}$$\nSubstituting the given numerical value $m = 0.67$, we obtain the explicit power law:\n$$r = k \\frac{E_0^{1.67}}{\\rho}$$\nThis shows that the lateral interaction radius $r$ scales with the beam energy to the power of $1.67$ and is inversely proportional to the mass density $\\rho$. This completes the first part of the problem.\n\nPart 2: Numerical estimation of $r$.\n\nWe are asked to use the derived scaling law to estimate $r$ for four different scenarios. The most robust method is to use ratios, which eliminates the need to calculate the constant $k$ explicitly. Let the reference values be $r_{\\mathrm{ref}}$, $E_{\\mathrm{ref}}$, and $\\rho_{\\mathrm{ref}}$, and the values for the new material be $r$, $E_0$, and $\\rho$.\nWe have:\n$$r = k \\frac{E_0^{1.67}}{\\rho}$$\n$$r_{\\mathrm{ref}} = k \\frac{E_{\\mathrm{ref}}^{1.67}}{\\rho_{\\mathrm{ref}}}$$\nDividing the first equation by the second eliminates $k$:\n$$\\frac{r}{r_{\\mathrm{ref}}} = \\frac{E_0^{1.67}/\\rho}{E_{\\mathrm{ref}}^{1.67}/\\rho_{\\mathrm{ref}}} = \\left(\\frac{E_0}{E_{\\mathrm{ref}}}\\right)^{1.67} \\left(\\frac{\\rho_{\\mathrm{ref}}}{\\rho}\\right)$$\nSolving for $r$:\n$$r = r_{\\mathrm{ref}} \\left(\\frac{E_0}{E_{\\mathrm{ref}}}\\right)^{1.67} \\left(\\frac{\\rho_{\\mathrm{ref}}}{\\rho}\\right)$$\nThe given calibration data are for amorphous carbon:\n$r_{\\mathrm{ref}} = 100.0 \\ \\mathrm{nm}$\n$E_{\\mathrm{ref}} = 5.00 \\ \\mathrm{keV}$\n$\\rho_{\\mathrm{ref}} = 2.00 \\ \\mathrm{g \\, cm^{-3}}$\n\nWe now calculate $r$ for the four specified cases.\n\nCase 1: Polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) at $E_0 = 2.00 \\ \\mathrm{keV}$.\n$\\rho_{\\mathrm{PMMA}} = 1.19 \\ \\mathrm{g \\, cm^{-3}}$\n$$r_{\\mathrm{PMMA}, 2\\mathrm{keV}} = 100.0 \\ \\mathrm{nm} \\times \\left(\\frac{2.00}{5.00}\\right)^{1.67} \\times \\left(\\frac{2.00}{1.19}\\right)$$\n$$r_{\\mathrm{PMMA}, 2\\mathrm{keV}} = 100.0 \\times (0.4)^{1.67} \\times 1.68067...$$\n$$r_{\\mathrm{PMMA}, 2\\mathrm{keV}} = 100.0 \\times 0.21650... \\times 1.68067... = 36.387... \\ \\mathrm{nm}$$\nRounded to three significant figures, this is $36.4 \\ \\mathrm{nm}$.\n\nCase 2: PMMA at $E_0 = 10.00 \\ \\mathrm{keV}$.\n$\\rho_{\\mathrm{PMMA}} = 1.19 \\ \\mathrm{g \\, cm^{-3}}$\n$$r_{\\mathrm{PMMA}, 10\\mathrm{keV}} = 100.0 \\ \\mathrm{nm} \\times \\left(\\frac{10.00}{5.00}\\right)^{1.67} \\times \\left(\\frac{2.00}{1.19}\\right)$$\n$$r_{\\mathrm{PMMA}, 10\\mathrm{keV}} = 100.0 \\times (2.0)^{1.67} \\times 1.68067...$$\n$$r_{\\mathrm{PMMA}, 10\\mathrm{keV}} = 100.0 \\times 3.1820... \\times 1.68067... = 534.79... \\ \\mathrm{nm}$$\nRounded to three significant figures, this is $535 \\ \\mathrm{nm}$.\n\nCase 3: Copper (Cu) at $E_0 = 2.00 \\ \\mathrm{keV}$.\n$\\rho_{\\mathrm{Cu}} = 8.96 \\ \\mathrm{g \\, cm^{-3}}$\n$$r_{\\mathrm{Cu}, 2\\mathrm{keV}} = 100.0 \\ \\mathrm{nm} \\times \\left(\\frac{2.00}{5.00}\\right)^{1.67} \\times \\left(\\frac{2.00}{8.96}\\right)$$\n$$r_{\\mathrm{Cu}, 2\\mathrm{keV}} = 100.0 \\times (0.4)^{1.67} \\times 0.22321...$$\n$$r_{\\mathrm{Cu}, 2\\mathrm{keV}} = 100.0 \\times 0.21650... \\times 0.22321... = 4.831... \\ \\mathrm{nm}$$\nRounded to three significant figures, this is $4.83 \\ \\mathrm{nm}$.\n\nCase 4: Copper (Cu) at $E_0 = 10.00 \\ \\mathrm{keV}$.\n$\\rho_{\\mathrm{Cu}} = 8.96 \\ \\mathrm{g \\, cm^{-3}}$\n$$r_{\\mathrm{Cu}, 10\\mathrm{keV}} = 100.0 \\ \\mathrm{nm} \\times \\left(\\frac{10.00}{5.00}\\right)^{1.67} \\times \\left(\\frac{2.00}{8.96}\\right)$$\n$$r_{\\mathrm{Cu}, 10\\mathrm{keV}} = 100.0 \\times (2.0)^{1.67} \\times 0.22321...$$\n$$r_{\\mathrm{Cu}, 10\\mathrm{keV}} = 100.0 \\times 3.1820... \\times 0.22321... = 70.99... \\ \\mathrm{nm}$$\nRounded to three significant figures, this is $71.0 \\ \\mathrm{nm}$.\n\nThe four calculated values, in the requested order (PMMA at $2.00 \\ \\mathrm{keV}$, PMMA at $10.00 \\ \\mathrm{keV}$, Cu at $2.00 \\ \\mathrm{keV}$, Cu at $10.00 \\ \\mathrm{keV}$), are $36.4$, $535$, $4.83$, and $71.0$.", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{ \\begin{pmatrix} 36.4 & 535 & 4.83 & 71.0 \\end{pmatrix} } $$", "id": "2867936"}, {"introduction": "When performing nanoscale chemical analysis in a scanning transmission electron microscope (STEM), the ultimate spatial resolution is fundamentally limited by the spreading of the electron beam as it passes through the specimen.

The final reported answer must be the pair $\\big(\\mathrm{FWHM}_{\\mathrm{EDS}},\\,\\mathrm{FWHM}_{\\mathrm{EELS}}\\big)$.", "solution": "We begin from the stochastic small-angle multiple-scattering model. Let $z$ denote the depth into the foil, with $z=0$ at the entrance surface and $z=t$ at the exit. The electron’s lateral displacement $x(z)$ satisfies\n$$\n\\frac{dx}{dz}=\\theta(z),\\quad x(0)=0,\n$$\nwhere $\\theta(z)$ is the small scattering angle relative to the optic axis. The model posits that $\\theta(z)$ undergoes a zero-mean Gaussian Markov process with stationary, delta-correlated increments, characterized by an angular diffusion coefficient $\\kappa$. This is a Wiener process, which implies that the mean-squared angle at depth $z$ is $\\langle \\theta^2(z) \\rangle = \\kappa z$ and the angular correlation function is $\\langle \\theta(s) \\theta(s') \\rangle = \\kappa \\min(s, s')$.\n\nThe lateral displacement is the $z$-integral of the angle:\n$$\nx(z)=\\int_{0}^{z}\\theta(s)\\,ds.\n$$\nThe RMS lateral spread at depth $z$ is obtained from the variance $\\langle x^2(z) \\rangle$:\n$$\n\\langle x^{2}(z)\\rangle = \\left\\langle \\left( \\int_{0}^{z}\\theta(s)\\,ds \\right)^2 \\right\\rangle = \\int_{0}^{z} ds \\int_{0}^{z} ds' \\, \\langle \\theta(s)\\theta(s') \\rangle.\n$$\nSubstituting the correlation function:\n$$\n\\langle x^{2}(z)\\rangle = \\kappa \\int_{0}^{z} ds \\int_{0}^{z} ds' \\, \\min(s, s').\n$$\nThis double integral can be solved by splitting the domain:\n$$\n\\langle x^{2}(z)\\rangle = \\kappa \\int_{0}^{z} ds \\left( \\int_{0}^{s} s' ds' + \\int_{s}^{z} s ds' \\right) = \\kappa \\int_{0}^{z} ds \\left( \\frac{s^2}{2} + s(z-s) \\right)\n$$\n$$\n\\langle x^{2}(z)\\rangle = \\kappa \\int_{0}^{z} \\left( zs - \\frac{s^2}{2} \\right) ds = \\kappa \\left[ \\frac{zs^2}{2} - \\frac{s^3}{6} \\right]_0^z = \\kappa \\left( \\frac{z^3}{2} - \\frac{z^3}{6} \\right) = \\frac{\\kappa z^3}{3}.\n$$\nThus the RMS lateral spread due to elastic multiple scattering at depth $z$ is\n$$\n\\sigma_{b}(z)=\\sqrt{\\langle x^{2}(z)\\rangle}=\\sqrt{\\frac{\\kappa z^{3}}{3}}.\n$$\n\nWe next incorporate the inelastic generation and define the depth-averaged point-spread function (PSF). Under the assumption that the inelastic event probability per unit length is uniform in $z$, the measured map is the average over $z\\in[0,t]$ of the local PSF at depth $z$. For EDS, the inelastic ionization is approximated as point-like in the transverse plane, hence the local PSF at depth $z$ is a Gaussian with variance $\\sigma_{b}^{2}(z)$. Averaging a family of zero-mean Gaussians with variances $\\{\\sigma_{b}^{2}(z)\\}$, all centered at zero and weighted uniformly in $z$, yields an overall zero-mean distribution whose variance is the average of the variances:\n$$\n\\sigma_{\\mathrm{EDS}}^{2}(t)=\\frac{1}{t}\\int_{0}^{t}\\sigma_{b}^{2}(z)\\,dz=\\frac{1}{t}\\int_{0}^{t}\\frac{\\kappa z^{3}}{3}\\,dz=\\frac{\\kappa}{3t}\\cdot \\frac{t^{4}}{4}=\\frac{\\kappa t^{3}}{12}.\n$$\nHence\n$$\n\\sigma_{\\mathrm{EDS}}(t)=\\sqrt{\\frac{\\kappa t^{3}}{12}}.\n$$\n\nFor EELS at a given core-loss $\\Delta E$, we include an intrinsic inelastic delocalization with RMS width\n$$\nb_{0}=\\frac{\\hbar v}{\\Delta E}.\n$$\nThis can be motivated in the first Born approximation by identifying a characteristic transverse extent from the uncertainty relation using a typical momentum transfer $q\\sim \\Delta E/v$, so that a characteristic impact parameter is $b\\sim \\hbar/q\\sim \\hbar v/\\Delta E$. We model this delocalization as a Gaussian independent of the elastic broadening, so local spreads at depth $z$ add in quadrature, giving a local variance $\\sigma_{b}^{2}(z)+b_{0}^{2}$. Averaging uniformly in $z$,\n$$\n\\sigma_{\\mathrm{EELS}}^{2}(t)=\\frac{1}{t}\\int_{0}^{t}\\big(\\sigma_{b}^{2}(z)+b_{0}^{2}\\big)\\,dz=\\frac{1}{t}\\int_{0}^{t}\\frac{\\kappa z^{3}}{3}\\,dz+b_{0}^{2}=\\frac{\\kappa t^{3}}{12}+b_{0}^{2}.\n$$\nThus\n$$\n\\sigma_{\\mathrm{EELS}}(t)=\\sqrt{\\frac{\\kappa t^{3}}{12}+b_{0}^{2}}.\n$$\n\nWe convert RMS widths to full width at half maximum (FWHM) using the Gaussian relation $\\mathrm{FWHM}=2\\sqrt{2\\ln 2}\\,\\sigma$.
