The existence of a rank-one connection of the form $RU = I + \\mathbf{a} \\otimes \\mathbf{n}$ imposes a strong condition on the principal stretches of $U$. From the equality $U^2 - I = \\mathbf{a} \\otimes \\mathbf{n} + \\mathbf{n} \\otimes \\mathbf{a} + s^2 (\\mathbf{n} \\otimes \\mathbf{n})$, the tensor on the right-hand side is constructed from only two vectors, $\\mathbf{a}$ and $\\mathbf{n}$, and is therefore of rank at most $2$. This implies that the tensor on the left-hand side, $U^2 - I$, must also have a rank of at most $2$.\nThe eigenvalues of $U^2 - I$ are found from the eigenvalues of $U^2$ ($\\lambda^2, 1, \\lambda^{-2}$) to be $\\lambda^2 - 1$, $1-1=0$, and $\\lambda^{-2}-1$. For the rank of $U^2 - I$ to be less than $3$, its determinant must be zero. This is true if and only if at least one of its eigenvalues is zero. In this case, the middle eigenvalue is exactly $0$. This implies that one of the eigenvalues of $U^2$ must be $1$, which in turn means one of the principal stretches (eigenvalues of $U$) must be $1$.\nThe problem statement provides $U$ with eigenvalues $\\{\\lambda, 1, \\lambda^{-1}\\}$, thereby satisfying this necessary condition a priori. The middle eigenvalue is $\\lambda_2=1$.\n\nThe dependence of $s$ on the middle eigenvalue $\\lambda_2$ is therefore not that of a parameter in the final functional form $s = |\\lambda - \\lambda^{-1}|$. Instead, the condition $\\lambda_2=1$ is a fundamental prerequisite for the existence of the described compatible interface. If $\\lambda_2 \\neq 1$ (and assuming the other eigenvalues are not $1$), the tensor $U^2-I$ would be of full rank, while the tensor $\\mathbf{a} \\otimes \\mathbf{n} + \\mathbf{n} \\otimes \\mathbf{a} + s^2 (\\mathbf{n} \\otimes \\mathbf{n})$ is at most of rank $2$, leading to a contradiction. Thus, no such solution $(\\mathbf{a}, \\mathbf{n}, R)$ would exist. The existence of an exactly compatible interface between austenite (represented by $I$) and a martensitic variant (represented by $U$) requires one of the principal stretches of the variant to be invariant. In the standard theory, for the ordered principal stretches $\\lambda_1 \\ge \\lambda_2 \\ge \\lambda_3 > 0$, the condition for such an interface is $\\lambda_2=1$, with $\\lambda_1 > 1$ and $\\lambda_3 < 1$.
