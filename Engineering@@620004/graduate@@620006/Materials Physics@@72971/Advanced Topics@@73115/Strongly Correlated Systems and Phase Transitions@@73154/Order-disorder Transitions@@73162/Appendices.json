We shall proceed with its formal solution. The analysis hinges on comparing the free energy of the ground state (a uniformly magnetized chain) with that of an excited state containing a single domain wall.\n\nFirst, we define the reference macrostate: the uniformly magnetized configuration. This corresponds to the ground state of the system since the exchange interaction constant $J$ is positive. There are two such microstates: all spins up ($S_i = +1$ for all $i=1, \\dots, L$) or all spins down ($S_i = -1$ for all $i=1, \\dots, L$). For either of these microstates, the product of adjacent spins is $S_i S_{i+1} = 1$ for all $i \\in \\{1, \\dots, L-1\\}$. The Hamiltonian $\\mathcal{H} = -J \\sum_{i=1}^{L-1} S_i S_{i+1}$ gives the ground state energy $E_0$ as:\n$$\nE_0 = -J \\sum_{i=1}^{L-1} (1) = -J(L-1)\n$$\nThe number of microstates compatible with this energy is $\\Omega_0 = 2$. According to the Boltzmann definition of entropy, the entropy of this ground state macrostate is:\n$$\nS_0 = k_B \\ln \\Omega_0 = k_B \\ln(2)\n$$\n\nNext, we consider the macrostate defined by the presence of exactly one domain wall. A domain wall is located at the bond between sites $k$ and $k+1$ if $S_k S_{k+1} = -1$. In an otherwise uniformly magnetized configuration, this means all other bonds satisfy $S_i S_{i+1} = 1$. The chain has $L-1$ bonds, so the domain wall can be at any position $k \\in \\{1, \\dots, L-1\\}$. For a configuration with a single domain wall, one bond contributes an energy of $+J$ to the total energy, while the other $L-2$ bonds contribute $-J$ each. The energy $E_1$ of any microstate with one domain wall is therefore:\n$$\nE_1 = -J \\times (L-2) + J \\times (1) = -J(L-3)\n$$\nThe energy cost to introduce one domain wall is the difference $\\Delta E = E_1 - E_0$:\n$$\n\\Delta E = [-J(L-3)] - [-J(L-1)] = -JL + 3J + JL - J = 2J\n$$\nNow, we must correctly enumerate the number of microstates, $\\Omega_1$, corresponding to this macrostate. The domain wall can be placed at any of the $L-1$ possible bonds. For each position, there are two possible configurations: one where the spins switch from $+1$ to $-1$, and one where they switch from $-1$ to $+1$. Thus, the total number of microstates with a single domain wall is:\n$$\n\\Omega_1 = 2 \\times (L-1)\n$$\nThe entropy of this macrostate is:\n$$\nS_1 = k_B \\ln \\Omega_1 = k_B \\ln(2(L-1))\n$$\nThe change in entropy associated with creating one domain wall is $\\Delta S = S_1 - S_0$:\n$$\n\\Delta S = k_B \\ln(2(L-1)) - k_B \\ln(2) = k_B \\ln\\left(\\frac{2(L-1)}{2}\\right) = k_B \\ln(L-1)\n$$\nThe creation of a domain wall costs energy but increases entropy.
