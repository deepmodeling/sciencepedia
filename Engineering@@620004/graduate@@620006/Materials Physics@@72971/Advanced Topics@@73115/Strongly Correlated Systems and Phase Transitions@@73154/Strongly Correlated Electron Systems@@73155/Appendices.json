The low-energy sector corresponds to states with exactly one electron per site, which minimizes the energy of $H_0$. This low-energy subspace, which we denote by $\\mathcal{P}$, has an energy eigenvalue $E_0=0$ under $H_0$. This subspace is highly degenerate, with a degeneracy of $2^N$ for a lattice of $N$ sites, corresponding to the two possible spin orientations for the electron at each site. All other states, which contain at least one doubly-occupied site (a \"doublon\") and one empty site (a \"holon\"), belong to the high-energy (excited) subspace, which we denote by $\\mathcal{Q}$. The lowest-lying excited states are those with a single doublon-holon pair, having an energy of $U$ under $H_0$.\n\nWe seek an effective Hamiltonian, $H_{\\mathrm{eff}}$, that acts solely within the degenerate subspace $\\mathcal{P}$. We use second-order degenerate perturbation theory. The effective Hamiltonian up to second order in the perturbation $V$ is given by:\n$$\nH_{\\mathrm{eff}} = P H_0 P + P V P + P V \\frac{Q}{E_0 - H_0} V P + \\mathcal{O}(V^3)\n$$\nHere, $P$ is the projection operator onto the low-energy subspace $\\mathcal{P}$, and $Q=1-P$ is the projector onto the excited subspace $\\mathcal{Q}$.\n\nLet us analyze the terms:\n1.  $P H_0 P$: Since all states $|\\psi\\rangle \\in \\mathcal{P}$ are eigenstates of $H_0$ with eigenvalue $E_0=0$, this term is simply $E_0 P = 0$.\n2.  $P V P$: The hopping operator $V$ moves an electron from one site to a neighboring one. If we start in any state $|\\psi\\rangle \\in \\mathcal{P}$ (where every site is singly occupied), moving an electron from site $j$ to site $i$ necessarily creates a doubly-occupied site at $i$ and an empty site at $j$. The resulting state lies in the excited subspace $\\mathcal{Q}$. Therefore, $P V |\\psi\\rangle = 0$ for any $|\\psi\\rangle \\in \\mathcal{P}$, which implies $PVP=0$.\n\nThe first non-trivial contribution comes from the second-order term:\n$$\nH_{\\mathrm{eff}}^{(2)} = P V \\frac{Q}{E_0 - H_0} V P\n$$\nThe perturbation $V$ maps states from $\\mathcal{P}$ to states in $\\mathcal{Q}$ with one doublon-holon pair. For any such state $|\\phi\\rangle \\in \\mathcal{Q}$ generated from $\\mathcal{P}$ by a single hop, $H_0 |\\phi\\rangle = U |\\phi\\rangle$. Since $H_0$ is diagonal in the basis of site occupations, the operator $(E_0 - H_0)^{-1}$ acting on this subspace is simply a multiplication by $(0-U)^{-1} = -1/U$.\nThus, the effective Hamiltonian simplifies to:\n$$\nH_{\\mathrm{eff}} = -\\frac{1}{U} P V^2 P\n$$\nThe problem asks for a nearest-neighbor spin Hamiltonian, so we only need to consider terms in $V^2$ where the two hops involve the same pair of nearest-neighbor sites $\\langle i, j \\rangle$.

The hopping operator $V_{ij}$ cannot move an electron, say from site $j$ to site $i$, because site $i$ is already occupied by an electron of the same spin (Pauli exclusion principle). Any term like $c_{i\\uparrow}^{\\dagger}c_{j\\uparrow}$ acting on $|\\uparrow\\uparrow\\rangle$ yields zero. Thus, $V_{ij} |t_1\\rangle = 0$ and similarly $V_{ij} |t_{-1}\\rangle = 0$. This implies $H_{ij}$ has zero eigenvalue for these states: $E_{t_{\\pm 1}} = 0$.\n\n2.  Action on states with $S_z = 0$: $|\\uparrow\\downarrow\\rangle$ and $|\\downarrow\\uparrow\\rangle$.\n    Let's calculate the action of $V_{ij}$ on $|\\uparrow\\downarrow\\rangle = c_{i\\uparrow}^{\\dagger}c_{j\\downarrow}^{\\dagger}|0\\rangle$.

The model is defined on a lattice with a rectangular density of states (DOS).\n\nFirst, we determine the probabilities of the four possible local configurations on a given lattice site in the paramagnetic state at half-filling. Let $D$ be the probability of a site being doubly occupied. The four states are: empty ($\\ket{0}$), spin-up ($\\ket{\\uparrow}$), spin-down ($\\ket{\\downarrow}$), and doubly occupied ($\\ket{\\uparrow\\downarrow}$). Their respective probabilities are $p_0$, $p_\\uparrow$, $p_\\downarrow$, and $p_D$.\n\nBy definition, $p_D = D$.\nIn a paramagnetic state, there is no spin preference, so $p_\\uparrow = p_\\downarrow$. We denote this common probability by $p_s$.\nThe system is at half-filling, meaning the average number of electrons per site is $\\langle n \\rangle = 1$. The average occupancy is given by $\\langle n \\rangle = p_\\uparrow + p_\\downarrow + 2p_D = 2p_s + 2D$.\nSetting this to $1$ gives $2p_s + 2D = 1$, which solves to $p_s = \\frac{1-2D}{2}$.\nThe sum of all probabilities must be $1$: $p_0 + p_\\uparrow + p_\\downarrow + p_D = 1$.\nSubstituting the known probabilities gives $p_0 + 2p_s + D = 1$. Using $2p_s = 1-2D$, we get $p_0 + (1-2D) + D = 1$, which simplifies to $p_0 - D = 0$, so $p_0 = D$.\nThus, the probabilities of the local configurations are expressed in terms of $D$:\n- Empty site probability: $p_0 = D$\n- Singly occupied site probability (spin up or down): $p_\\uparrow = p_\\downarrow = \\frac{1-2D}{2}$\n- Doubly occupied site probability: $p_D = D$\nThese probabilities are physically meaningful for $D$ in the range $[0, 1/2]$.\n\nThe next step is to find the quasiparticle renormalization factor $Z$. The problem states that $Z$ is the square of the hopping renormalization amplitude. In the Gutzwiller approximation (or the equivalent Kotliar-Ruckenstein slave-boson mean-field theory) for a paramagnetic state at half-filling, the renormalization factor $Z$ which multiplies the kinetic energy is given as a function of the double occupancy $D$:\n$$Z(D) = 8D(1-2D)$$\nThis canonical formula is valid for $D \\in [0, 1/4]$. At $U=0$, the system is non-interacting, and the probabilities are given by random occupancies: $p_D = n_\\uparrow n_\\downarrow = (\\frac{1}{2})(\\frac{1}{2}) = \\frac{1}{4}$. For $D=\\frac{1}{4}$, $Z(\\frac{1}{4}) = 8(\\frac{1}{4})(1-2(\\frac{1}{4})) = 2(1-\\frac{1}{2}) = 1$, corresponding to no renormalization.

Since the kinetic energy is lowered by forming the band, $\\varepsilon_0$ is negative. Let us write $\\varepsilon_0 = -|\\varepsilon_0|$. Substituting the expression for $Z(D)$:\n$$E(D) = 8D(1-2D)\\varepsilon_0 + UD = -8D(1-2D)|\\varepsilon_0| + UD$$\n$$E(D) = (-8|\\varepsilon_0| + U)D + 16|\\varepsilon_0|D^2$$\nTo find the optimal value of $D$, we minimize $E(D)$ with respect to $D$:\n$$\\frac{dE}{dD} = -8|\\varepsilon_0| + U + 32|\\varepsilon_0|D = 0$$\nSolving for $D$, we obtain the optimal double occupancy as a function of $U$:\n$$32|\\varepsilon_0|D = 8|\\varepsilon_0| - U$$\n$$D(U) = \\frac{8|\\varepsilon_0| - U}{32|\\varepsilon_0|} = \\frac{1}{4} - \\frac{U}{32|\\varepsilon_0|}$$\nThis expression is valid as long as $D \\ge 0$. The metal-insulator transition occurs at a critical interaction strength $U_c$ where the double occupancy vanishes, i.e., $D(U_c) = 0$.\n$$0 = \\frac{1}{4} - \\frac{U_c}{32|\\varepsilon_0|} \\implies \\frac{U_c}{32|\\varepsilon_0|} = \\frac{1}{4} \\implies U_c = 8|\\varepsilon_0|$$\nIn terms of the negative quantity $\\varepsilon_0$, this is $U_c = -8\\varepsilon_0$. At this point, $Z(D=0) = 0$, consistent with the formation of a Mott insulator.\n\nNow, we must compute $\\varepsilon_0$ for the given rectangular DOS.

The given DOS is:\n$$\n\\rho(\\varepsilon) \\;=\\; \\begin{cases}\n\\frac{1}{W}, & |\\varepsilon| \\le \\frac{W}{2}\\\\\n0, & \\text{otherwise}\n\\end{cases}\n$$\nWith $\\varepsilon_F=0$, the integral becomes:\n$$\\varepsilon_0 = \\int_{-W/2}^{0} \\varepsilon \\left(2 \\cdot \\frac{1}{W}\\right) d\\varepsilon = \\frac{2}{W} \\int_{-W/2}^{0} \\varepsilon \\, d\\varepsilon$$\n$$\\varepsilon_0 = \\frac{2}{W} \\left[ \\frac{\\varepsilon^2}{2} \\right]_{-W/2}^{0} = \\frac{1}{W} \\left[ 0^2 - \\left(-\\frac{W}{2}\\right)^2 \\right] = \\frac{1}{W} \\left( -\\frac{W^2}{4} \\right) = -\\frac{W}{4}$$\nSo, $|\\varepsilon_0| = \\frac{W}{4}$.\n\nWe can now express the critical interaction $U_c$ in terms of the bandwidth $W$:\n$$U_c = -8\\varepsilon_0 = -8\\left(-\\frac{W}{4}\\right) = 2W$$\nThe metal-insulator transition occurs when the Hubbard $U$ is twice the bandwidth $W$.\n\nFinally, we eliminate $D$ to find the expression for $Z$ as a function of $U$ and $W$. We have two equations:\n$1.$ $Z = 8D(1-2D)$\n$2.$ $D = \\frac{1}{4} - \\frac{U}{32|\\varepsilon_0|} = \\frac{1}{4} - \\frac{U}{32(W/4)} = \\frac{1}{4} - \\frac{U}{8W}$\nWe substitute the second equation into the first. Let's first compute the factor $(1-2D)$:\n$$1-2D = 1 - 2\\left(\\frac{1}{4} - \\frac{U}{8W}\\right) = 1 - \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{U}{4W} = \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{U}{4W}$$\nNow, substitute the expressions for $D$ and $(1-2D)$ into the formula for $Z$:\n$$Z(U,W) = 8 \\left(\\frac{1}{4} - \\frac{U}{8W}\\right) \\left(\\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{U}{4W}\\right)$$\nWe can factor out common terms to simplify the expression:\n$$Z(U,W) = 8 \\cdot \\frac{1}{4}\\left(1 - \\frac{U}{2W}\\right) \\cdot \\frac{1}{2}\\left(1 + \\frac{U}{2W}\\right)$$\n$$Z(U,W) = 8 \\cdot \\frac{1}{8} \\left(1 - \\frac{U}{2W}\\right)\\left(1 + \\frac{U}{2W}\\right)$$\nThis simplifies using the difference of squares formula $(a-b)(a+b) = a^2-b^2$:\n$$Z(U,W) = 1 - \\left(\\frac{U}{2W}\\right)^2 = 1 - \\frac{U^2}{4W^2}$$\nThis expression gives the quasiparticle renormalization factor for $0 \\le U \\le U_c = 2W$. At $U=0$, $Z=1$, and at $U=U_c=2W$, $Z=0$. For $U > U_c$, the system is in the Mott insulating state where $D=0$ and thus $Z=0$.\nThe problem asks for the expression in the range $0 \\le U \\le U_c$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{1 - \\frac{U^2}{4W^2}}$$", "id": "2861974"}]}
