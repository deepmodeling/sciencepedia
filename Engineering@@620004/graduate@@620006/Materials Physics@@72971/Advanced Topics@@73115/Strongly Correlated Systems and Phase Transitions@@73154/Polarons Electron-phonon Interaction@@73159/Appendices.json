These operators obey the standard canonical (anti)commutation relations: $\\{c_i, c_j^{\\dagger}\\} = \\delta_{ij}$, $\\{c_i, c_j\\} = 0$, and $[b_i, b_j^{\\dagger}] = \\delta_{ij}$, $[b_i, b_j] = 0$.\n\nThe LF transformation is a unitary transformation generated by $U = e^S$, where the generator $S$ is given by\n$$ S = \\frac{g}{\\omega_0} \\sum_{i} n_i \\left(b_i^{\\dagger} - b_i\\right) $$\nThe generator $S$ is anti-Hermitian, $S^{\\dagger} = -S$, which ensures that $U$ is unitary, i.e., $U^{\\dagger} = U^{-1} = e^{-S}$. The transformed Hamiltonian is $\\tilde{H} = U H U^{\\dagger} = e^S H e^{-S}$. We transform each operator $A$ as $\\tilde{A} = e^S A e^{-S}$. This can be expanded using the Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff (BCH) expansion $\\tilde{A} = A + [S, A] + \\frac{1}{2!}[S, [S, A]] + \\dots$.\n\nFirst, we find the transformations of the fundamental operators.\n1.

Let $X_i = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{g}{\\omega_0}(b_i^{\\dagger} - b_i)\\right)$. Then the hopping term is $\\tilde{H}_e = -t \\sum_{\\langle i,j\\rangle} c_i^{\\dagger} c_j X_i^{-1} X_j$.\n\nThe total transformed Hamiltonian is:\n$$ \\tilde{H} = -\\frac{g^2}{\\omega_0}\\sum_i n_i + \\omega_0 \\sum_i b_i^{\\dagger}b_i - t \\sum_{\\langle i,j\\rangle} c_i^{\\dagger} c_j X_i^{-1} X_j $$\nFor a single electron, $\\sum_i n_i = 1$, so the first term is a constant polaron binding energy $E_p = -g^2/\\omega_0$.\nThe problem is now to find the energy spectrum of $\\tilde{H}$. We work in the small polaron limit where the hopping $t$ is small compared to the coupling $g$. We treat the hopping term as a perturbation. To the lowest order in $t$, the polaron dispersion is obtained by taking the expectation value of $\\tilde{H}$ with respect to the phonon ground state at zero temperature, $|0\\rangle_{ph}$, which is the state annihilated by all $b_i$. This gives an effective electronic Hamiltonian.\n$$ H_{eff} = \\langle 0 |_{ph} \\tilde{H} | 0 \\rangle_{ph} = E_p - t_{eff} \\sum_{\\langle i,j\\rangle} c_i^{\\dagger} c_j $$\nwhere $t_{eff} = t \\langle 0 |_{ph} X_i^{-1} X_j | 0 \\rangle_{ph}$. Since phonon operators at different sites commute, this is $t_{eff} = t \\langle 0 |_{ph} X_i^{-1} | 0 \\rangle_{ph} \\langle 0 |_{ph} X_j | 0 \\rangle_{ph}$.\nWe calculate the expectation value using the BCH formula $e^{A+B}=e^A e^B e^{-[A,B]/2}$ for $[A,B]$ being a c-number. Let $\\alpha = -g/\\omega_0$.\n$$ \\langle 0 | X_j | 0 \\rangle = \\langle 0 | \\exp(\\alpha(b_j^{\\dagger}-b_j)) | 0 \\rangle = \\langle 0 | \\exp(\\alpha b_j^{\\dagger}) \\exp(-\\alpha b_j) \\exp(-[\\alpha b_j^{\\dagger},-\\alpha b_j]/2) | 0 \\rangle. $$\nWith $[b_j, b_j^{\\dagger}]=1$, the commutator in the exponent is $-\\alpha^2 [b_j^{\\dagger}, -b_j]/2 = \\alpha^2/2$.\nSince $b_j|0\\rangle_{ph}=0$ and $\\langle 0|_{ph}b_j^{\\dagger}=0$, we get $\\langle 0 | \\exp(-\\alpha b_j)|0\\rangle = 1$ and $\\langle 0 | \\exp(\\alpha b_j^{\\dagger})|0\\rangle=1$.\nWait, the expectation value should be $\\exp(\\alpha^2/2)$. But the BCH expansion for $e^{\\beta(b^\\dagger-b)}$ is $e^{\\beta b^\\dagger} e^{-\\beta b} e^{-\\beta^2/2}$.\nLet's re-verify. Let $X_j = \\exp(-\\frac{g}{\\omega_0}(b_j^\\dagger - b_j))$. Using $e^{A+B}=e^A e^B e^{-[A,B]/2}$ with $A = -\\frac{g}{\\omega_0}b_j^\\dagger$ and $B = \\frac{g}{\\omega_0}b_j$, we get\n$$ X_j = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{g}{\\omega_0}b_j^\\dagger\\right) \\exp\\left(\\frac{g}{\\omega_0}b_j\\right) \\exp\\left(-\\frac{1}{2}\\left[-\\frac{g}{\\omega_0}b_j^\\dagger, \\frac{g}{\\omega_0}b_j\\right]\\right) = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{g}{\\omega_0}b_j^\\dagger\\right) \\exp\\left(\\frac{g}{\\omega_0}b_j\\right) \\exp\\left(-\\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\frac{g}{\\omega_0}\\right)^2\\right). $$\nSo, $\\langle 0 | X_j | 0 \\rangle = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{1}{2}(g/\\omega_0)^2\\right)$.\nSimilarly, $\\langle 0 | X_i^{-1} | 0 \\rangle = \\langle 0 | \\exp\\left(\\frac{g}{\\omega_0}(b_i^{\\dagger}-b_i)\\right) | 0 \\rangle = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{1}{2}(g/\\omega_0)^2\\right)$.\nSo the effective hopping is $t_{eff} = t \\exp\\left(-(g/\\omega_0)^2\\right)$.\n\nThe effective Hamiltonian describes a polaron moving in a tight-binding band with a reduced hopping amplitude $t_{eff}$:\n$$ H_{polaron} = -\\frac{g^2}{\\omega_0} - t_{eff} \\sum_{\\langle i,j\\rangle} c_i^{\\dagger} c_j $$\nThe dispersion relation for this Hamiltonian on a $d$-dimensional hypercubic lattice is found by Fourier transformation $c_j = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{N}}\\sum_{\\boldsymbol{k}} e^{i\\boldsymbol{k}\\cdot \\boldsymbol{R}_j} c_{\\boldsymbol{k}}$:\n$$ \\varepsilon_{\\boldsymbol{k}} = -\\frac{g^2}{\\omega_0} - t_{eff} \\sum_{\\boldsymbol{\\delta}} e^{i\\boldsymbol{k}\\cdot\\boldsymbol{\\delta}} = -\\frac{g^2}{\\omega_0} - 2t_{eff} \\sum_{l=1}^d \\cos(k_l a) $$\nwhere $\\boldsymbol{\\delta}$ are the nearest-neighbor vectors.

It is based on the standard Holstein model, a cornerstone of electron-phonon physics. The problem is therefore valid, and we may proceed with the solution.\n\nThe tendency for an electron to self-trap and form a small polaron is determined by the competition between two energy scales:\n1.  The **lattice relaxation energy** ($E_p$): the energy gain from the lattice deforming around a localized electron.\n2.  The **electronic kinetic energy** ($E_k$): the energy cost of localizing an electron, which would otherwise delocalize over the lattice to lower its energy. This scale is related to the electronic bandwidth, $W$.\n\nThe problem states a \"rough self-trapping criterion\" that a small polaron forms when $E_p$ outweighs the kinetic energy scale. We will use the half-bandwidth, $W/2$, as the relevant kinetic energy scale. The criterion for strong polaron formation is thus $E_p \\gtrsim W/2$.\n\n**1. Lattice Relaxation Energy ($E_p$)**\n\nThe problem specifies a local Holstein coupling, where the electron at site $i$ interacts with phonons on the same site. The relevant part of the Hamiltonian for an electron localized at a single site is a harmonic oscillator with frequency $\\omega_0$ coupled to a static source via the coupling $g$. The Hamiltonian for this phonon mode is $H_{ph} = \\hbar \\omega_0 a^\\dagger a + g(a+a^\\dagger)$. This is a displaced harmonic oscillator. Its ground state energy is shifted downwards relative to the uncoupled oscillator by an amount equal to the polaron binding energy, or lattice relaxation energy $E_p$. As specified by basis (ii) in the problem, this energy lowering is given by:\n$$E_p = \\frac{g^2}{\\hbar \\omega_0}$$\nThis energy is a purely local quantity and is therefore independent of the lattice dimension $d$.\nUsing the given parameters, $g = 0.10\\,\\mathrm{eV}$ and $\\hbar \\omega_0 = 0.050\\,\\mathrm{eV}$:\n$$E_p = \\frac{(0.10\\,\\mathrm{eV})^2}{0.050\\,\\mathrm{eV}} = \\frac{0.010\\,\\mathrm{eV}^2}{0.050\\,\\mathrm{eV}} = 0.20\\,\\mathrm{eV}$$\n\n**2. Electronic Kinetic Energy Scale (Bandwidth)**\n\nThe problem specifies a tight-binding model on a hypercubic lattice with nearest-neighbor hopping $t$. According to basis (i), the energy dispersion is:\n$$E(\\mathbf{k}) = -2t \\sum_{i=1}^{d} \\cos(k_i a)$$\nwhere $d$ is the dimension and $a$ is the lattice constant. The bandwidth $W$ is the difference between the maximum and minimum energy values. The minimum energy (bottom of the band) is $E_{min} = -2dt$ (for $\\mathbf{k}=0$) and the maximum energy (top of the band) is $E_{max} = 2dt$ (for $k_i = \\pi/a$).\nThe total bandwidth is $W = E_{max} - E_{min} = 4dt$.\nThe kinetic energy scale for delocalization is the half-bandwidth, $W/2 = 2dt$. This represents the energy gained by an electron delocalizing from a single site (energy reference $0$) to the bottom of the band.\n\nWe calculate this scale for $d=1$ and $d=3$ using $t=0.10\\,\\mathrm{eV}$:\n- For a $1$D chain ($d=1$): The kinetic energy scale is $W_1/2 = 2(1)t = 2t = 2(0.10\\,\\mathrm{eV}) = 0.20\\,\\mathrm{eV}$.\n- For a $3$D simple cubic lattice ($d=3$): The kinetic energy scale is $W_3/2 = 2(3)t = 6t = 6(0.10\\,\\mathrm{eV}) = 0.60\\,\\mathrm{eV}$.\n\n**3. Comparison and Evaluation of Options**\n\nWe compare $E_p = 0.20\\,\\mathrm{eV}$ with the kinetic energy scales.\n- In $d=1$: $E_p = 0.20\\,\\mathrm{eV}$ and $W_1/2 = 0.20\\,\\mathrm{eV}$. Here, $E_p / (W_1/2) = 1$. The system is at the threshold for self-trapping.\n- In $d=3$: $E_p = 0.20\\,\\mathrm{eV}$ and $W_3/2 = 0.60\\,\\mathrm{eV}$. Here, $E_p / (W_3/2) = 1/3$. The kinetic energy cost significantly outweighs the relaxation energy, so self-trapping is not favored.\n\nNow, we analyze each statement.\n\n**A. With the given parameters, the tendency to self-trap is stronger in $d=1$ than in $d=3$ because the electronic bandwidth is smaller in lower dimension. Quantitatively, the criterion for self-trapping is at (or above) threshold in $d=1$ but not satisfied in $d=3$.**\nThis statement is fully consistent with our analysis. The dimensionless ratio governing self-trapping, $\\lambda = E_p / (W/2)$, is $\\lambda_1 = 1$ in $d=1$ and $\\lambda_3 = 1/3$ in $d=3$. Since $\\lambda_1 > \\lambda_3$, the tendency is stronger in $d=1$. The reason is correctly identified: the bandwidth $W = 4dt$ is smaller in $d=1$ ($4t$) than in $d=3$ ($12t$), making it easier for the fixed relaxation energy $E_p$ to overcome the kinetic energy cost. The quantitative conclusion that the criterion is met (at threshold) in $d=1$ but not in $d=3$ is also correct.\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\n**B. The propensity to form a small polaron is controlled solely by the phonon quantum $\\hbar \\omega_0$; reducing $\\hbar \\omega_0$ necessarily weakens polaron formation because lattice quanta are harder to excite.**\nThe propensity to form a polaron is determined by the dimensionless ratio $\\lambda = \\frac{E_p}{W/2} = \\frac{g^2/(\\hbar\\omega_0)}{2dt}$. This ratio depends on $g$, $t$, and $d$, not solely on $\\hbar\\omega_0$. Furthermore, $\\lambda \\propto 1/(\\hbar\\omega_0)$, meaning that reducing $\\hbar\\omega_0$ *increases* $\\lambda$ and thus *strengthens* the tendency for polaron formation. A smaller $\\hbar\\omega_0$ corresponds to a \"softer\" lattice, which is easier to distort, leading to a larger relaxation energy $E_p$. The reasoning given is also false: a smaller quantum $\\hbar\\omega_0$ means phonons are *easier* to excite, not harder.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**C. For a local Holstein coupling, the lattice relaxation energy per electron is larger in higher dimensions because there are more neighbors, so it is larger in $d=3$ than in $d=1$ for the same $t$, $\\omega_0$, and $g$.**\nThis statement is false. The Holstein coupling is local, meaning the electron interacts only with phonons at its own site. The number of neighboring sites is irrelevant for this local interaction. As derived, the relaxation energy $E_p = g^2/(\\hbar\\omega_0)$ is independent of the dimension $d$. It is the kinetic energy term (related to hopping to neighbors) that depends on dimension, not the local relaxation energy.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. At fixed $\\hbar \\omega_0$, increasing $g$ or decreasing $t$ favors self-trapping in any dimension by increasing the ratio of the lattice relaxation energy to the electronic kinetic energy scale.**\nThe ratio of interest is $\\lambda = \\frac{E_p}{W/2} = \\frac{g^2/(\\hbar\\omega_0)}{2dt}$.\n- Increasing $g$: Since $\\lambda \\propto g^2$, increasing $g$ increases the ratio, favoring self-trapping. This is physically intuitive, as $g$ is the strength of the interaction.\n- Decreasing $t$: Since $\\lambda \\propto 1/t$, decreasing $t$ also increases the ratio, favoring self-trapping. This is also intuitive, as a smaller $t$ means the electron is less mobile and easier to localize.\nThe reasoning provided, \"by increasing the ratio of the lattice relaxation energy to the electronic kinetic energy scale,\" is precisely the correct mechanism.\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\n**E. In the antiadiabatic regime $\\hbar \\omega_0 \\gg t$ at fixed $g$, the lattice relaxation energy increases with $\\omega_0$, so the tendency to form small polarons grows without bound as $\\omega_0$ increases.**\nThis statement contains multiple errors. Firstly, the static lattice relaxation energy is $E_p = g^2 / (\\hbar\\omega_0)$. This energy *decreases* as $\\omega_0$ increases, it does not increase. A larger $\\omega_0$ implies a stiffer lattice that is harder to deform. Secondly, the tendency to self-trap, governed by $\\lambda \\propto 1/\\omega_0$, consequently *decreases* as $\\omega_0$ increases. In the limit $\\omega_0 \\to \\infty$, the polaron effect via lattice relaxation vanishes. The antiadiabatic regime suppresses small polaron formation based on this mechanism.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{AD}$$", "id": "2853063"}, {"introduction": "In modern computational materials physics, theoretical concepts like the polaron dispersion are often investigated using methods like Quantum Monte Carlo (QMC), which operate in imaginary time. This presents a significant challenge: how do we connect the imaginary-time correlation functions from a simulation to the real-frequency spectral functions that contain the physically observable dispersion? This final hands-on practice tackles this problem head-on by guiding you through the implementation of analytic continuation, a crucial technique used to bridge simulation and experiment. You will learn to extract a polaron's energy dispersion from synthetic QMC-like data, gaining practical experience with a vital data analysis pipeline in contemporary condensed matter research [@problem_id:3010624].", "problem": "Consider a single-polaron problem where an electron interacts with a dispersionless optical phonon bath, producing a well-defined quasiparticle at low energy and a higher-energy incoherent continuum.

This is a common problem in computational condensed matter physics, particularly in studies employing Quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) methods, which naturally operate in imaginary time. The solution requires performing an analytic continuation from imaginary time, $\\tau$, to real frequency, $\\omega$, a numerically challenging procedure.\n\nThe theoretical foundation for this procedure is the Lehmann spectral representation. At zero temperature ($T=0$), the electron-addition imaginary-time Green's function, $G(\\mathbf{k},\\tau)$, for an electron with momentum $\\mathbf{k}$ is related to its corresponding spectral function, $A^{+}(\\mathbf{k},\\omega)$, by a Laplace transform:\n$$\nG(\\mathbf{k},\\tau) = -\\int_{0}^{\\infty} d\\omega\\, A^{+}(\\mathbf{k},\\omega) e^{-\\omega \\tau} \\quad (\\text{for } \\tau>0)\n$$\nThe spectral function $A^{+}(\\mathbf{k},\\omega)$ is a non-negative quantity representing the probability density of adding an electron with momentum $\\mathbf{k}$ and energy $\\omega$ to the system. The polaron, a quasiparticle formed by the electron dressing itself with a cloud of phonons, manifests as a distinct, sharp peak in $A^{+}(\\mathbf{k},\\omega)$ at the lowest energy. The position of this peak defines the polaron dispersion relation $E(\\mathbf{k})$. Our goal is to recover $A^{+}(\\mathbf{k},\\omega)$ from noisy data for $G(\\mathbf{k},\\tau)$ and then locate this peak.\n\nInverting the Laplace transform is a classic ill-posed problem; small amounts of noise in the input data $G(\\mathbf{k},\\tau)$ can lead to large, unphysical oscillations in the recovered solution for $A^{+}(\\mathbf{k},\\omega)$. To obtain a stable and physically meaningful solution, we employ a regularized inversion scheme as specified.\n\nThe first step is to discretize the problem. We represent the continuous functions on uniform grids: $\\tau$ on a grid $\\{\\tau_i\\}_{i=0}^{N_\\tau-1}$ and $\\omega$ on a grid $\\{\\omega_j\\}_{j=0}^{N_\\omega-1}$. The integral equation then becomes a system of linear equations. Let $D_i = -G(\\mathbf{k},\\tau_i) > 0$. The discretized relation is:\n$$\nD_i = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} d\\omega\\, A^{+}(\\mathbf{k},\\omega) e^{-\\omega \\tau_i} \\approx \\sum_{j=0}^{N_\\omega-1} A^{+}(\\mathbf{k},\\omega_j) e^{-\\omega_j \\tau_i} \\Delta\\omega\n$$\nThis can be written in matrix form as $D \\approx K A$, where $A$ is the vector of unknown spectral function values $A_j = A^{+}(\\mathbf{k},\\omega_j)$, $D$ is the vector of input data $D_i$, and $K$ is the kernel matrix with elements $K_{ij} = e^{-\\omega_j \\tau_i} \\Delta\\omega$.\n\nTo combat the ill-posed nature of this inversion, we introduce two constraints. First, the physical requirement that the spectral function is non-negative, $A_j \\ge 0$. Second, we add a Tikhonov regularization term that enforces smoothness on the solution. This is achieved by minimizing a composite objective function:\n$$\n\\min_{A \\ge 0} \\left\\| K A - D \\right\\|_2^2 + \\lambda \\left\\| L A \\right\\|_2^2\n$$\nHere, $\\| \\cdot \\|_2^2$ denotes the squared Euclidean norm, $\\lambda$ is a positive regularization parameter that controls the trade-off between fitting the data and the smoothness of the solution, and $L$ is a matrix that approximates a derivative operator. The problem specifies a first-difference operator, $(LA)_j = A_j - A_{j+1}$, which penalizes large jumps between adjacent points in the spectrum.\n\nThis regularized minimization problem, subject to the non-negativity constraint, can be conveniently reformulated as a standard Non-Negative Least Squares (NNLS) problem. We construct an augmented matrix and an augmented data vector:\n$$\n\\tilde{K} = \\begin{pmatrix} K \\\\ \\sqrt{\\lambda} L \\end{pmatrix}, \\quad \\tilde{D} = \\begin{pmatrix} D \\\\ \\mathbf{0} \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe problem then becomes equivalent to solving $\\min_{\\tilde{A} \\ge 0} \\| \\tilde{K} \\tilde{A} - \\tilde{D} \\|_2^2$, for which efficient numerical solvers exist, such as `scipy.optimize.nnls`.\n\nThe overall algorithm proceeds as follows for each test case:\n1.  **Data Synthesis**: We first generate the synthetic \"experimental\" data. A physically motivated spectral function $A^{+}(\\mathbf{k},\\omega)$ is constructed as the sum of a sharp Gaussian for the polaron peak and a broad Gaussian for the incoherent continuum. The position of the polaron peak, $E(\\mathbf{k})$, is given by the parabolic effective mass approximation $E(\\mathbf{k}) = E_0 + a|\\mathbf{k}|^2$. The Green's function $G(\\mathbf{k},\\tau_i)$ is computed by numerically integrating this $A^{+}(\\mathbf{k},\\omega)$ against the Laplace kernel $e^{-\\omega \\tau_i}$. Finally, a small amount of Gaussian noise is added to simulate experimental uncertainty. The input vector for the solver is then set to $D_i = -G_{\\text{noisy}}(\\mathbf{k},\\tau_i)$.\n\n2.  **Analytic Continuation**: The augmented linear system $(\\tilde{K}, \\tilde{D})$ is constructed using the given parameters ($\\lambda$, grid definitions, etc.). The NNLS problem is solved to obtain the reconstructed spectral function, $A_{\\text{recon}}$.\n\n3.  **Peak Identification**: The final step is to extract the polaron energy from $A_{\\text{recon}}$. We identify all local maxima in the reconstructed spectrum. According to the specified rules, we filter these maxima, considering only those below a search energy cutoff $\\omega_{\\mathrm{search}} = 60\\,\\mathrm{meV}$ and with an amplitude exceeding a threshold of $\\alpha=0.05$ times the global maximum of $A_{\\text{recon}}$. The polaron energy $E(\\mathbf{k})$ is then identified as the energy of the lowest-frequency peak that satisfies these criteria. If no such peak is found, a fallback procedure selects the global maximum within the search region $\\omega \\le \\omega_{\\text{search}}$.\n\nThis procedure provides a robust and standard methodology for extracting spectral information from imaginary-time correlation data, a fundamental task in modern computational physics.", "answer": "```python\n# The complete and runnable Python 3 code goes here.\n# Imports must adhere to the specified execution environment.\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy.optimize import nnls\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves the polaron dispersion problem by performing analytic continuation\n    on synthetic imaginary-time Green's function data.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define the test cases from the problem statement.\n    test_cases = [\n        {  # Case 1 (general case)\n            \"k_mag\": 0.50, \"E0\": 20.0, \"a\": 8.0, \"Zk\": 0.7, \"A_cont\": 0.3,\n            \"omega_cont\": 110.0, \"sigma_cont\": 35.0, \"sigma_pk\": 2.0\n        },\n        {  # Case 2 (heavy quasiparticle)\n            \"k_mag\": 1.50, \"E0\": 30.0, \"a\": 3.0, \"Zk\": 0.5, \"A_cont\": 0.6,\n            \"omega_cont\": 90.0, \"sigma_cont\": 50.0, \"sigma_pk\": 2.0\n        },\n        {  # Case 3 (low quasiparticle weight, strong continuum)\n            \"k_mag\": 0.10, \"E0\": 12.0, \"a\": 5.0, \"Zk\": 0.2, \"A_cont\": 0.9,\n            \"omega_cont\": 80.0, \"sigma_cont\": 60.0, \"sigma_pk\": 2.0\n        }\n    ]\n\n    # --- Global parameters ---\n    # Grids\n    omega_max = 300.0\n    delta_omega = 1.0\n    tau_min = 0.05\n    tau_max = 5.00\n    N_tau = 100\n    \n    # Analytic continuation parameters\n    reg_lambda = 1e-2\n    \n    # Peak identification parameters\n    omega_search = 60.0\n    alpha_threshold = 0.05\n    \n    # Use a seeded random number generator for reproducibility\n    rng = np.random.default_rng(42)\n\n    # --- Setup grids ---\n    omega_grid = np.arange(0, omega_max + delta_omega, delta_omega)\n    N_omega = len(omega_grid)\n    tau_grid = np.linspace(tau_min, tau_max, N_tau)\n\n    results = []\n    \n    for params in test_cases:\n        # --- 1.
