This confirms that for the given constraints on $b$ and $c$, a non-zero order parameter exists at the transition.

The system transitions from an equilibrium state $\\phi = 0$ for $T > T_{t}$ to one of two degenerate states $\\phi = \\pm\\sqrt{-b/(2c)}$ at $T_t$. The magnitude of this jump is the required answer.\nTo verify this represents a stable transition, we can solve for $a_t$ by substituting $\\phi_s^2$ back into Equation 1:\n$$a_t + b\\left(-\\frac{b}{2c}\\right) + c\\left(-\\frac{b}{2c}\\right)^2 = 0 \\implies a_t - \\frac{b^2}{2c} + \\frac{b^2}{4c} = 0 \\implies a_t = \\frac{b^2}{4c}$$\nSince $b^2 > 0$ and $c > 0$, we have $a_t > 0$. This implies that the transition temperature $T_t$ is greater than the temperature $T_0$ at which $a(T)$ changes sign, as $a(T)$ is monotonically increasing. The stability of all minima at $T_t$ can be confirmed by analyzing the second derivative $\\frac{\\partial^2 F}{\\partial \\phi^2} = 2a_t + 12b\\phi^2 + 30c\\phi^4$, which is positive for both $\\phi=0$ and $\\phi=\\phi_s$.
