It is scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and contains all necessary information for a unique solution.\n\nWe are tasked with deriving the low-energy effective Hamiltonian for the single-band Hubbard model in the strong-coupling limit ($U \\gg t$) at half-filling (one electron per site). The starting point is the Hubbard Hamiltonian $H = H_U + H_t$, where:\n$$H_{U} = U \\sum_{i} n_{i\\uparrow} n_{i\\downarrow}$$\n$$H_{t} = - t \\sum_{\\langle i j \\rangle, \\sigma} \\left( c_{i\\sigma}^{\\dagger} c_{j\\sigma} + c_{j\\sigma}^{\\dagger} c_{i\\sigma} \\right)$$\nHere, $U$ is the on-site Coulomb repulsion, $t$ is the nearest-neighbor hopping amplitude, $c_{i\\sigma}^{\\dagger}$ ($c_{i\\sigma}$) are creation (annihilation) operators for an electron with spin $\\sigma \\in \\{\\uparrow, \\downarrow\\}$ on site $i$, and $n_{i\\sigma} = c_{i\\sigma}^{\\dagger} c_{i\\sigma}$ is the number operator.\n\nIn the strong-coupling limit, we treat $H_t$ as a perturbation to the unperturbed Hamiltonian $H_0 = H_U$. At half-filling, the ground state of $H_0$ consists of all configurations with exactly one electron on each site, such that there are no doubly occupied sites ($n_{i\\uparrow}n_{i\\downarrow} = 0$ for all $i$). The energy of this ground state manifold is $E_0^{(0)} = 0$. This manifold is highly degenerate, with the degeneracy corresponding to the $2^N$ possible spin configurations for $N$ sites.\n\nThe first excited states of $H_0$ are those where an electron has hopped from one site to a neighbor, creating one doubly occupied site and one empty site. Such a state has an energy of $E_{exc} = U$ because of the single doubly occupied site.\n\nWe use second-order degenerate perturbation theory to find the effective Hamiltonian $H_{eff}$ that acts within the degenerate ground state manifold. Let $P_0$ be the projection operator onto this manifold (subspace with no double occupancy) and $Q_0 = 1 - P_0$ be the projector onto all other states (including the excited states with energy $U$). The effective Hamiltonian up to second order in $t$ is given by:\n$$H_{eff} = P_0 H_t P_0 + P_0 H_t \\frac{Q_0}{E_0^{(0)} - H_0} H_t P_0$$\nThe first-order term, $P_0 H_t P_0$, is zero. The hopping operator $H_t$ always changes the number of electrons on sites, moving a state with single occupancy on every site to a state with one doubly occupied and one empty site. Such a state lies outside the manifold projected by $P_0$. Therefore, $P_0 H_t P_0 = 0$.\n\nThe second-order term describes virtual processes where the system temporarily enters an excited state. An electron hops from site $j$ to a neighboring site $i$, creating an intermediate state with energy $U$. Then, an electron hops back, returning the system to the singly occupied ground-state manifold. The energy denominator is $E_0^{(0)} - U = -U$.\n$$H_{eff} = P_0 H_t \\frac{1}{-U} H_t P_0$$\nLet's analyze the operator product $H_t^2$ and its projection.\n$$H_t^2 = (-t)^2 \\sum_{\\langle i j \\rangle, \\sigma} \\sum_{\\langle k l \\rangle, \\sigma'} (c_{i\\sigma}^{\\dagger} c_{j\\sigma} + c_{j\\sigma}^{\\dagger} c_{i\\sigma}) (c_{k\\sigma'}^{\\dagger} c_{l\\sigma'} + c_{l\\sigma'}^{\\dagger} c_{k\\sigma'})$$\nWe are interested in processes that start in $P_0$, go to an intermediate state in $Q_0$ (with one double occupancy), and return to $P_0$. This requires the two hops to be linked. For instance, an electron hops from $j \\to i$, creating a doublon on site $i$. Then an electron must hop from site $i$ to return to a state in $P_0$. This means the second hop must be $i \\to j$. So for a given pair $\\langle i j \\rangle$, the relevant processes contributing to the effective interaction between them are:\n1. Electron hops $j \\to i$, then an electron hops $i \\to j$.\n2. Electron hops $i \\to j$, then an electron hops $j \\to i$.\n\nThese two processes generate the same set of terms. Let's consider the first process for a pair $\\langle i j \\rangle$. The operator sequence is $(c_{j\\sigma'}^{\\dagger} c_{i\\sigma'})(c_{i\\sigma}^{\\dagger} c_{j\\sigma})$.

A careful analysis shows that these processes lead to an effective spin-spin interaction. This can be expressed in terms of the spin operators $\\mathbf{S}_i = \\frac{1}{2} \\sum_{\\alpha,\\beta} c_{i\\alpha}^{\\dagger} \\boldsymbol{\\tau}_{\\alpha\\beta} c_{i\\beta}$, where $\\boldsymbol{\\tau}$ are the Pauli matrices.

This contributes to terms proportional to $S_i^z S_j^z$ and a constant.\nb) Off-diagonal processes: An electron with spin $\\sigma$ hops from $j \\to i$ and an electron with spin $\\bar{\\sigma}$ hops back $i \\to j$. This corresponds to a spin exchange and contributes to terms like $S_i^+ S_j^-$ and $S_i^- S_j^+$.\n\nA full derivation shows that both types of processes lead to an isotropic interaction.

The term $-\\sum_{\\langle i j \\rangle} \\frac{t^2}{U}$ is a constant energy shift and does not affect the spin dynamics.
