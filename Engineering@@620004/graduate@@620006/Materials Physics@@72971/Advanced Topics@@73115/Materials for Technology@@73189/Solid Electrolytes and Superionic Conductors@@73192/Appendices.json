It consolidates several material-specific parameters: $\\sigma_{0} \\propto n q^{2} a^{2} \\nu_{0}$. Physically, it depends on the number of available charge carriers ($n$), their charge squared ($q^{2}$), the geometry of the hopping path (jump distance $a$ and structural factors), and the characteristic frequency at which ions attempt to hop ($\\nu_{0}$, the attempt frequency, related to lattice vibrations).

The capacitance associated with grain boundaries, $C_{\\mathrm{gb}}$, is generally much larger than the bulk geometric capacitance, $C_{\\mathrm{b}}$, consistent with the nanofarad value given for the mid-frequency arc. The ion-blocking nature of the electrodes correctly implies a capacitive response at low frequencies (the formation of an electrical double layer), represented by a nearly vertical line in the Nyquist plot. The problem is self-contained, scientifically sound, and well-posed. The description is objective and presents a non-trivial but standard problem in the analysis of ionic conductors.\n\nThe problem is deemed **valid**. A solution will be derived.\n\n**Derivation of the Solution**\n\nThe system is a polycrystalline solid electrolyte situated between two ion-blocking electrodes. The transport of charge (lithium ions) from one electrode to the other constitutes the electrical current. This process can be deconstructed into several sequential physical phenomena, each contributing to the total impedance of the cell.\n\n1.  **Bulk Transport**: Ions move through the crystalline interior of the grains. This region has an intrinsic ionic conductivity, $\\sigma_{\\mathrm{b}}$, giving rise to a bulk resistance, $R_{\\mathrm{b}}$. As a dielectric medium, it also has a geometric capacitance, $C_{\\mathrm{b}}$, due to polarization. These two processes, conduction and dielectric polarization, occur in parallel within the bulk. The impedance of the bulk, $Z_{\\mathrm{b}}$, is thus represented by a parallel resistor-capacitor network, $\\left[R_{\\mathrm{b}} \\parallel C_{\\mathrm{b}}\\right]$. The corresponding time constant is $\\tau_{\\mathrm{b}} = R_{\\mathrm{b}} C_{\\mathrm{b}}$.\n\n2.  **Grain Boundary Transport**: After traversing a grain, ions must cross a grain boundary. Grain boundaries are structurally disordered regions and typically present a higher barrier to ion migration than the crystalline bulk. Thus, they have a lower conductivity $\\sigma_{\\mathrm{gb}} < \\sigma_{\\mathrm{b}}$ and a correspondingly higher resistance $R_{\\mathrm{gb}}$. Grain boundaries also have a dielectric character and an associated capacitance $C_{\\mathrm{gb}}$. As noted, typically $C_{\\mathrm{gb}} \\gg C_{\\mathrm{b}}$. The impedance of the grain boundaries, $Z_{\\mathrm{gb}}$, is also modeled as a parallel network, $\\left[R_{\\mathrm{gb}} \\parallel C_{\\mathrm{gb}}\\right]$, with a time constant $\\tau_{\\mathrm{gb}} = R_{\\mathrm{gb}} C_{\\mathrm{gb}}$. Since typically $R_{\\mathrm{gb}} > R_{\\mathrm{b}}$ and $C_{\\mathrm{gb}} \\gg C_{\\mathrm{b}}$, it follows that $\\tau_{\\mathrm{gb}} \\gg \\tau_{\\mathrm{b}}$. The characteristic frequency of a semicircle is $\\omega_{\\mathrm{peak}} = 1/\\tau$. Therefore, the bulk process appears at higher frequencies than the grain boundary process.\n\n3.  **Electrode Interface**: The electrodes are ion-blocking. This means ions cannot be supplied or consumed at the electrode surface via a Faradaic reaction. Instead, they accumulate at the electrode-electrolyte interface, forming an electrical double layer. This double layer acts as a capacitor. Because there is no charge transfer across the interface, there is no parallel charge-transfer resistance, $R_{\\mathrm{ct}}$. The impedance of this interface, $Z_{\\mathrm{e}}$, is purely capacitive (or nearly so). This capacitive behavior dominates at very low frequencies, where its impedance $Z_{\\mathrm{e}} = 1/(j\\omega C_{\\mathrm{e}})$ becomes very large. In a Nyquist plot, an ideal capacitor gives a vertical line.\n\n4.  **Total Impedance**: According to principle (c), processes that occur in sequence add in series. For an ion to traverse the cell, it must pass through the bulk, then grain boundaries, and finally be blocked at the electrode. Therefore, the total impedance $Z_{\\mathrm{total}}$ is the series sum of the impedances of these three parts:\n    $$Z_{\\mathrm{total}} = Z_{\\mathrm{b}} + Z_{\\mathrm{gb}} + Z_{\\mathrm{e}}$$\n    where $Z_{\\mathrm{b}}$ corresponds to the high-frequency semicircle, $Z_{\\mathrm{gb}}$ to the mid-frequency semicircle, and $Z_{\\mathrm{e}}$ to the low-frequency vertical tail.\n\n5.  **Non-ideal Behavior**: The problem specifies the semicircles are \"depressed.\" This is a common experimental finding, arising from microscopic heterogeneities that lead to a distribution of relaxation times. As stated in principle (d), this is modeled by replacing the ideal capacitors ($C$) with Constant Phase Elements (CPEs). The impedance of a CPE is $Z_{\\mathrm{CPE}} = (Q(j\\omega)^n)^{-1}$, where $Q$ is a parameter with units of $\\mathrm{F \\cdot s^{n-1}}$ and $0 < n \\le 1$ is the exponent. For $n=1$, the CPE is an ideal capacitor. For $n<1$, it results in a depressed semicircle in a parallel RC-type circuit, or a titled line for a series element. The nearly vertical tail implies $n_{\\mathrm{e}} \\approx 1$ for the electrode CPE.\n\nThe correct equivalent circuit must therefore consist of two parallel R-CPE subcircuits in series, followed by a series CPE.\n\n**Evaluation of Options**\n\n*   **A**: This option proposes the model $\\left[R_{\\mathrm{b}} \\parallel \\mathrm{CPE}_{\\mathrm{b}}\\right]$ in series with $\\left[R_{\\mathrm{gb}} \\parallel \\mathrm{CPE}_{\\mathrm{gb}}\\right]$, in series with a capacitive element $\\mathrm{CPE}_{\\mathrm{e}}$. This topology is in exact agreement with the first-principles derivation above. It correctly models the sequential nature of ion transport through bulk and grain boundaries, and the blocking behavior at the electrode. It accounts for the two observed semicircles and the low-frequency tail, as well as their depressed nature. The order of the features (bulk at high frequency, grain boundary at mid-frequency, electrode at low frequency) is also consistent with the typical magnitudes of the respective resistances and capacitances.\n    **Verdict: Correct.**\n\n*   **B**: This option proposes a parallel network $\\left(R_{\\mathrm{b}} \\parallel R_{\\mathrm{gb}} \\parallel R_{\\mathrm{e}}\\right)$ in series with a single capacitor $C_{\\mathrm{tot}}$.

This topology is physically nonsensical. It improperly separates resistive and capacitive effects into parallel branches, contrary to the principle that conduction and polarization are parallel processes within a given medium. The circuit would not generate the observed impedance spectrum.\n    **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n*   **D**: This option correctly identifies the series connection of bulk and grain boundary elements but incorrectly models the electrode interface. It includes a charge transfer resistance ($R_{\\mathrm{ct}}$) and a Warburg element. The problem explicitly states that electrodes are ion-blocking with \"no Faradaic charge transfer,\" which rules out an $R_{\\mathrm{ct}}$. The problem also states that the low-frequency tail is nearly vertical and lacks a $45^\\circ$ region, which rules out a Warburg element representing semi-infinite diffusion.\n    **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n*   **E**: This option proposes placing the electrode capacitance in parallel with the series combination of the bulk and grain boundary elements: $\\left(\\left[R_{\\mathrm{b}} \\parallel C_{\\mathrm{b}}\\right] + \\left[R_{\\mathrm{gb}} \\parallel C_{\\mathrm{gb}}\\right]\\right) \\parallel C_{\\mathrm{e}}$.
