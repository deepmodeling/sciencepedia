Hot electrons are carriers that have gained significant kinetic energy from a strong applied electric field, such that their energy $E$ is much greater than the thermal energy $k_B T$. Our derived relation $m^{*}(E) = m^{*}_{0}(1+2\\alpha E)$ demonstrates that the effective mass of an electron increases linearly with its kinetic energy.\nAccording to the semiclassical equation of motion, an electron's acceleration is inversely proportional to its mass. As an electron is accelerated by a high field and gains energy, its effective mass increases. This increased inertia makes the electron progressively more difficult to accelerate further. Consequently, the mobility $\\mu$, which relates drift velocity to the electric field and is inversely dependent on effective mass (e.g., in the Drude model, $\\mu=q\\tau/m^{*}$), decreases for high-energy electrons. This effect is a primary cause of velocity saturation, a phenomenon where the average drift velocity of carriers in a semiconductor ceases to increase with the electric field, approaching a constant limiting value at very high fields. The energy-dependence of the effective mass is therefore a critical factor limiting the performance of electronic devices operating under high-field conditions.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{1.2}$$", "id": "2482447"}, {"introduction": "Building upon the principle of an energy-dependent effective mass, we now explore how the interplay between acceleration and scattering culminates in a limiting drift velocity.

The next step is to express the integral in terms of the given parameters. The scattering rate $\\gamma$ depends on energy, which in turn depends on time. We must first establish the time-dependence of the scattering rate, $\\gamma(t')$.\n\nThe scattering rate is given by $\\gamma(\\varepsilon) = \\Gamma_0 + \\Gamma_1 \\varepsilon$.\nThe kinetic energy at time $t'$ is $\\varepsilon(t') = \\frac{1}{2} m^{\\ast} v(t')^2$.\nThe velocity at time $t'$ is $v(t') = v_0 + a t'$.\nSubstituting these into the expression for $\\gamma$:\n$$\n\\gamma(t') = \\Gamma_0 + \\Gamma_1 \\left( \\frac{1}{2} m^{\\ast} (v_0 + a t')^2 \\right)\n$$\nNow, we must evaluate the integral $\\int_0^{t_f} \\gamma(t') \\, dt'$.\n$$\n\\int_0^{t_f} \\gamma(t') \\, dt' = \\int_0^{t_f} \\left[ \\Gamma_0 + \\frac{\\Gamma_1 m^{\\ast}}{2} (v_0 + a t')^2 \\right] dt'\n$$\nThe integral can be split into two parts:\n$$\n\\int_0^{t_f} \\gamma(t') \\, dt' = \\int_0^{t_f} \\Gamma_0 \\, dt' + \\frac{\\Gamma_1 m^{\\ast}}{2} \\int_0^{t_f} (v_0 + a t')^2 \\, dt'\n$$\nThe first part is trivial:\n$$\n\\int_0^{t_f} \\Gamma_0 \\, dt' = \\Gamma_0 t_f\n$$\nFor the second part, we expand the squared term:\n$$\n(v_0 + a t')^2 = v_0^2 + 2 v_0 a t' + a^2 (t')^2\n$$\nIntegrating this expression from $0$ to $t_f$:\n$$\n\\int_0^{t_f} (v_0^2 + 2 v_0 a t' + a^2 (t')^2) \\, dt' = \\left[ v_0^2 t' + 2 v_0 a \\frac{(t')^2}{2} + a^2 \\frac{(t')^3}{3} \\right]_0^{t_f}\n$$\n$$\n= v_0^2 t_f + v_0 a t_f^2 + \\frac{a^2}{3} t_f^3\n$$\nSubstituting this back into the expression for the full integral:\n$$\n\\int_0^{t_f} \\gamma(t') \\, dt' = \\Gamma_0 t_f + \\frac{\\Gamma_1 m^{\\ast}}{2} \\left( v_0^2 t_f + v_0 a t_f^2 + \\frac{a^2}{3} t_f^3 \\right)\n$$\nFinally, we set this equal to $-\\ln r$ to obtain the equation for $t_f$:\n$$\n\\Gamma_0 t_f + \\frac{\\Gamma_1 m^{\\ast}}{2} \\left( v_0^2 t_f + v_0 a t_f^2 + \\frac{a^2}{3} t_f^3 \\right) = -\\ln r\n$$\nThis is a cubic equation in $t_f$ which, once $r$ is drawn, must be solved to find the duration of the next free flight.\n\n### Evaluation of Options\n\n**A. $\\Gamma_0\\, t_f + \\dfrac{\\Gamma_1 m^{\\ast}}{2} \\left( v_0^2\\, t_f + v_0 a\\, t_f^2 + \\dfrac{a^2}{3}\\, t_f^3 \\right) = - \\ln r$**\nThis equation is identical to the one derived from first principles. It correctly integrates the time-dependent scattering rate over the free-flight interval.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. $t_f = \\dfrac{-\\ln r}{\\Gamma_0 + \\dfrac{\\Gamma_1 m^{\\ast}}{2}\\left(v_0 + a t_f\\right)^2}$**\nThis equation can be rewritten as $t_f \\left[ \\Gamma_0 + \\frac{\\Gamma_1 m^{\\ast}}{2}(v_0 + a t_f)^2 \\right] = -\\ln r$. The term in the brackets is $\\gamma(t_f)$, the scattering rate at the *end* of the free flight. The equation is therefore $t_f \\cdot \\gamma(t_f) = -\\ln r$. This would only be correct if the scattering rate were constant over the interval $[0, t_f]$ and equal to its final value $\\gamma(t_f)$. This is incorrect, as the rate varies with time due to acceleration. The correct formulation requires integrating the rate over time.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. $\\left(\\Gamma_0 + \\dfrac{\\Gamma_1 m^{\\ast}}{2} v_0^2\\right)\\, t_f = - \\ln r$**\nThe term in parentheses is $\\Gamma_0 + \\Gamma_1 \\left(\\frac{1}{2} m^{\\ast} v_0^2\\right) = \\Gamma_0 + \\Gamma_1 \\varepsilon(0) = \\gamma(0)$, which is the scattering rate at the *beginning* of the free flight. The equation is therefore $t_f \\cdot \\gamma(0) = -\\ln r$. This is the correct formula only if the scattering rate is constant throughout the free flight, which is not the case here since the electron accelerates, causing its energy and thus its scattering rate to change (for $\\Gamma_1 > 0$). This is a simplification, not the exact formulation.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. Introduce a constant majorant rate $\\Lambda$, draw $t_f = \\dfrac{-\\ln r}{\\Lambda}$, and accept a real scattering at $t_f$ with probability $p(t_f) = \\dfrac{\\Gamma_0 + \\dfrac{\\Gamma_1 m^{\\ast}}{2}\\left(v_0 + a t_f\\right)^2}{\\Lambda}$**\nThis describes the self-scattering or null-collision technique. It is a valid and widely used algorithm in Monte Carlo simulations, particularly for handling complex, non-constant scattering rates. However, the problem statement explicitly includes the constraint: \"**Without introducing any null-collision (self-scattering) majorant**\". Therefore, this option, while representing a correct algorithm in a general context, is explicitly disallowed by the premises of this specific problem.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2828164"}]}
