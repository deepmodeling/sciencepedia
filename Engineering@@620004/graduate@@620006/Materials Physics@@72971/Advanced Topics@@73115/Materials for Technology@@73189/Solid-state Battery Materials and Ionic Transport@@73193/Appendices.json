It requires the analysis of simulated ionic transport data to extract fundamental kinetic parameters. The problem is scientifically grounded in the principles of statistical mechanics and condensed matter physics, provides all necessary data and constants, and follows a logically sound and unambiguous procedure. It is therefore deemed a valid problem.\n\nThe solution proceeds systematically, grounded in three fundamental physical relationships.\n\nFirst, the tracer diffusion coefficient $D$ relates to the mean-squared displacement (MSD) of a particle, denoted $\\langle \\Delta r^2(t)\\rangle$, through the Einstein relation. In three spatial dimensions ($d=3$), this is given by:\n$$\nD = \\lim_{t\\to\\infty} \\frac{1}{6t} \\langle \\Delta r^2(t)\\rangle\n$$\nIn practice, we determine the slope $s = \\frac{d\\langle \\Delta r^2(t)\\rangle}{dt}$ in the long-time, linear (diffusive) regime of the MSD plot. The diffusion coefficient is then $D = s/6$. The data provided from a simulation with periodic boundary conditions (PBC) yields the raw, size-dependent coefficient $D_{\\mathrm{PBC}}$.\n\nSecond, molecular dynamics simulations in a finite periodic box introduce artifacts. The mobility of an ion is artificially enhanced by hydrodynamic interactions with its own periodic images. For a cubic cell of side length $L$, the leading-order correction to the diffusion coefficient calculated under PBC, $D_{\\mathrm{PBC}}$, relates it to the infinite-system diffusion coefficient $D_{\\infty}$ via the Yeh-Hummer formula:\n$$\nD_{\\infty} = D_{\\mathrm{PBC}} - \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{B}} T \\xi}{6\\pi \\eta L}\n$$\nHere, $k_{\\mathrm{B}}$ is the Boltzmann constant, $T$ is the absolute temperature, $\\eta$ is the shear viscosity of the medium, and $\\xi$ is a dimensionless constant ($\\xi \\approx 2.837297$) that depends on the geometry of the simulation cell. This correction must be applied to obtain a physically meaningful diffusion coefficient representative of a bulk material.\n\nThird, ionic diffusion in a solid is a thermally activated process. The temperature dependence of the diffusion coefficient is well-described by the Arrhenius relation:\n$$\nD_{\\infty}(T) = D_0 \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_{\\mathrm{a}}}{k_{\\mathrm{B}} T}\\right)\n$$\nwhere $E_{\\mathrm{a}}$ is the activation energy for ion hopping and $D_0$ is the pre-exponential factor. To extract these parameters, we linearize this equation by taking the natural logarithm:\n$$\n\\ln D_{\\infty}(T) = \\ln D_0 - \\frac{E_{\\mathrm{a}}}{k_{\\mathrm{B}}} \\left(\\frac{1}{T}\\right)\n$$\nThis equation has the form of a straight line, $y = c + mx$, where $y = \\ln D_{\\infty}$, $x = 1/T$, the intercept is $c = \\ln D_0$, and the slope is $m = -E_{\\mathrm{a}}/k_{\\mathrm{B}}$.\n\nThe computational procedure is as follows:\n\n1.  For each temperature $T$ within a given test case, we perform an ordinary least-squares linear regression on the provided MSD data, $\\langle \\Delta r^2(t)\\rangle$, against time $t$. This fit is restricted to the specified \"long-time\" window, $t \\in [t_{\\min}, t_{\\max}]$, to ensure we are in the diffusive regime. The slope of this fit, $s$, is obtained in units of $\\text{Å}^2/\\text{ps}$.\n\n2.  The raw diffusion coefficient $D_{\\mathrm{PBC}}$ is calculated from the slope $s$ and converted to SI units ($\\text{m}^2/\\text{s}$). Given $d=3$, and the conversion factors $1\\,\\text{Å} = 10^{-10}\\,\\text{m}$ and $1\\,\\text{ps} = 10^{-12}\\,\\text{s}$, we have:\n    $$\n    D_{\\mathrm{PBC}}~[\\text{m}^2/\\text{s}] = \\frac{s~[\\text{Å}^2/\\text{ps}]}{6} \\times \\frac{(10^{-10}\\,\\text{m})^2/\\text{Å}^2}{10^{-12}\\,\\text{s}/\\text{ps}} = \\frac{s}{6} \\times 10^{-8}\n    $$\n\n3.  The finite-size correction term, $\\Delta D = \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{B}} T \\xi}{6\\pi \\eta L}$, is calculated using the provided parameters for each temperature. This value is added to $D_{\\mathrm{PBC}}$ to obtain the corrected diffusion coefficient $D_{\\infty}(T) = D_{\\mathrm{PBC}} + \\Delta D$. All parameters ($k_{\\mathrm{B}}, T, \\xi, \\eta, L$) must be in SI units for this calculation.\n\n4.  After computing $D_{\\infty}(T)$ for all temperatures in a test case, we generate a set of data points $(\\frac{1}{T}, \\ln D_{\\infty})$. A second linear regression is performed on these points.\n\n5.  The activation energy $E_{\\mathrm{a}}$ and prefactor $D_0$ are extracted from the slope $m$ and intercept $c$ of the Arrhenius fit:\n    $$\n    E_{\\mathrm{a}} = -m \\cdot k_{\\mathrm{B}}\n    $$\n    $$\n    D_0 = \\exp(c)\n    $$\n    The activation energy, calculated in Joules, is then converted to electronvolts (eV) using the given conversion factor $1\\,\\text{eV} = 1.602176634\\times 10^{-19}\\,\\text{J}$.
