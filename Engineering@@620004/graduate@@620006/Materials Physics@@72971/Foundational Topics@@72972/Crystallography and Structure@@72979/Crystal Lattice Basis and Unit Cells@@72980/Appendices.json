We must construct primitive translation vectors for each lattice, justify their completeness, calculate the primitive cell volumes, and finally compute the ratio of these volumes.\n\nFirst, we address the body-centered cubic (bcc) lattice. The conventional cell is a cube of side length $a$. The bcc lattice points are located at the corners of this cube and at its body center. If we place the origin of a Cartesian coordinate system at one corner, the lattice points within the conventional cell are at $(0,0,0)$ and $a(\\frac{1}{2},\\frac{1}{2},\\frac{1}{2})$. All other lattice points are translations of these two points by vectors $n_x a \\hat{\\mathbf{x}} + n_y a \\hat{\\mathbf{y}} + n_z a \\hat{\\mathbf{z}}$, where $n_x$, $n_y$, and $n_z$ are integers.\n\nA valid set of primitive translation vectors for the bcc lattice, constructed relative to the origin at a lattice point, is:\n$$ \\mathbf{a}_1 = \\frac{a}{2}(-\\hat{\\mathbf{x}} + \\hat{\\mathbf{y}} + \\hat{\\mathbf{z}}) $$\n$$ \\mathbf{a}_2 = \\frac{a}{2}(\\hat{\\mathbf{x}} - \\hat{\\mathbf{y}} + \\hat{\\mathbf{z}}) $$\n$$ \\mathbf{a}_3 = \\frac{a}{2}(\\hat{\\mathbf{x}} + \\hat{\\mathbf{y}} - \\hat{\\mathbf{z}}) $$\nThese vectors are linearly independent, which is readily verifiable. To justify that these vectors generate all and only the bcc lattice points, consider an arbitrary lattice vector $\\mathbf{R}$ formed by an integer linear combination $\\mathbf{R} = n_1 \\mathbf{a}_1 + n_2 \\mathbf{a}_2 + n_3 \\mathbf{a}_3$, where $n_1, n_2, n_3 \\in \\mathbb{Z}$. In Cartesian components, this is:\n$$ \\mathbf{R} = \\frac{a}{2}[(-n_1+n_2+n_3)\\hat{\\mathbf{x}} + (n_1-n_2+n_3)\\hat{\\mathbf{y}} + (n_1+n_2-n_3)\\hat{\\mathbf{z}}] $$\nLet the integer coefficients of the unit vectors (in units of $a/2$) be $N_x = -n_1+n_2+n_3$, $N_y = n_1-n_2+n_3$, and $N_z = n_1+n_2-n_3$. The sum of any two of these coefficients is an even number, for instance $N_x+N_y = 2n_3$. This implies that $N_x, N_y, N_z$ must all have the same parity.\nCase 1: $N_x, N_y, N_z$ are all even. Let $N_x=2k_x, N_y=2k_y, N_z=2k_z$ for some integers $k_x,k_y,k_z$. The position vector is $\\mathbf{R} = a(k_x\\hat{\\mathbf{x}} + k_y\\hat{\\mathbf{y}} + k_z\\hat{\\mathbf{z}})$. These are the corner points of the conventional cubic lattice.\nCase 2: $N_x, N_y, N_z$ are all odd. Let $N_x=2k_x+1, N_y=2k_y+1, N_z=2k_z+1$. The position vector is $\\mathbf{R} = \\frac{a}{2}((2k_x+1)\\hat{\\mathbf{x}} + (2k_y+1)\\hat{\\mathbf{y}} + (2k_z+1)\\hat{\\mathbf{z}}) = a(k_x\\hat{\\mathbf{x}} + k_y\\hat{\\mathbf{y}} + k_z\\hat{\\mathbf{z}}) + \\frac{a}{2}(\\hat{\\mathbf{x}} + \\hat{\\mathbf{y}} + \\hat{\\mathbf{z}})$. These are the body-center points.\nSince any integer combination of the primitive vectors leads to one of these two cases, the vectors generate only bcc lattice points. Conversely, any bcc lattice point can be described by a set of coefficients $(N_x, N_y, N_z)$ with the same parity, for which integer solutions for $n_1, n_2, n_3$ exist: $n_1 = \\frac{1}{2}(N_y+N_z)$, $n_2 = \\frac{1}{2}(N_x+N_z)$, $n_3 = \\frac{1}{2}(N_x+N_y)$. These are integers because $N_i$ have the same parity. Thus, the vectors generate all bcc lattice points.\n\nThe volume of the primitive cell, $V_{\\mathrm{bcc,prim}}$, is the absolute value of the scalar triple product of the primitive vectors:\n$$ V_{\\mathrm{bcc,prim}} = |\\mathbf{a}_1 \\cdot (\\mathbf{a}_2 \\times \\mathbf{a}_3)| = \\left| \\det \\begin{pmatrix} -a/2  a/2  a/2 \\\\ a/2  -a/2  a/2 \\\\ a/2  a/2  -a/2 \\end{pmatrix} \\right| $$\n$$ V_{\\mathrm{bcc,prim}} = \\left(\\frac{a}{2}\\right)^3 \\left| \\det \\begin{pmatrix} -1  1  1 \\\\ 1  -1  1 \\\\ 1  1  -1 \\end{pmatrix} \\right| = \\frac{a^3}{8} |-1(1-1) - 1(-1-1) + 1(1 - (-1))| = \\frac{a^3}{8} |0+2+2| = \\frac{4a^3}{8} = \\frac{a^3}{2} $$\nTo reconcile this with a direct counting argument: the conventional bcc cell contains $8 \\times (1/8) = 1$ corner atom plus $1$ body-center atom, for a total of $N_{\\mathrm{bcc}} = 2$ lattice points. The volume of the conventional cell is $V_{\\mathrm{conv}} = a^3$. The volume per lattice point is $V_{\\mathrm{conv}}/N_{\\mathrm{bcc}} = a^3/2$. This matches our calculated $V_{\\mathrm{bcc,prim}}$, confirming that the primitive cell by definition contains exactly one lattice point.\n\nNext, we address the face-centered cubic (fcc) lattice. The lattice points are at the corners of the conventional cube and at the center of each of its $6$ faces.\nA valid set of primitive translation vectors for the fcc lattice, constructed from the origin at a lattice point, is:\n$$ \\mathbf{b}_1 = \\frac{a}{2}(\\hat{\\mathbf{y}} + \\hat{\\mathbf{z}}) $$\n$$ \\mathbf{b}_2 = \\frac{a}{2}(\\hat{\\mathbf{z}} + \\hat{\\mathbf{x}}) $$\n$$ \\mathbf{b}_3 = \\frac{a}{2}(\\hat{\\mathbf{x}} + \\hat{\\mathbf{y}}) $$\nThese vectors are also linearly independent. An arbitrary lattice vector is $\\mathbf{R} = m_1 \\mathbf{b}_1 + m_2 \\mathbf{b}_2 + m_3 \\mathbf{b}_3$, where $m_1, m_2, m_3 \\in \\mathbb{Z}$. In Cartesian components:\n$$ \\mathbf{R} = \\frac{a}{2}[(m_2+m_3)\\hat{\\mathbf{x}} + (m_1+m_3)\\hat{\\mathbf{y}} + (m_1+m_2)\\hat{\\mathbf{z}}] $$\nLet the integer coefficients of the unit vectors (in units of $a/2$) be $N_x = m_2+m_3$, $N_y = m_1+m_3$, and $N_z = m_1+m_2$. The sum of these coefficients is $N_x+N_y+N_z = 2(m_1+m_2+m_3)$, which is always an even integer. This condition, that a point with coordinates $(x,y,z)$ corresponds to an fcc lattice point if and only if $x/(a/2), y/(a/2), z/(a/2)$ are integers whose sum is even, correctly defines the fcc lattice. Thus, these vectors generate all and only fcc points. The converse holds as any fcc point with coordinates $(x,y,z)$ corresponds to integer or half-integer coefficients $(x/a, y/a, z/a)$ whose sum is an integer. This is equivalent to our condition, and integer solutions for $m_1, m_2, m_3$ can be found: $m_1 = \\frac{1}{2}(-N_x+N_y+N_z)$, etc., which are guaranteed to be integers.\n\nThe volume of the fcc primitive cell, $V_{\\mathrm{fcc,prim}}$, is:\n$$ V_{\\mathrm{fcc,prim}} = |\\mathbf{b}_1 \\cdot (\\mathbf{b}_2 \\times \\mathbf{b}_3)| = \\left| \\det \\begin{pmatrix} 0  a/2  a/2 \\\\ a/2  0  a/2 \\\\ a/2  a/2  0 \\end{pmatrix} \\right| $$\n$$ V_{\\mathrm{fcc,prim}} = \\left(\\frac{a}{2}\\right)^3 \\left| \\det \\begin{pmatrix} 0  1  1 \\\\ 1  0  1 \\\\ 1  1  0 \\end{pmatrix} \\right| = \\frac{a^3}{8} |0(0-1) - 1(0-1) + 1(1-0)| = \\frac{a^3}{8} |0+1+1| = \\frac{2a^3}{8} = \\frac{a^3}{4} $$\nThe direct counting argument for the conventional fcc cell yields $8 \\times (1/8) = 1$ corner atom plus $6 \\times (1/2) = 3$ face-center atoms, for a total of $N_{\\mathrm{fcc}} = 4$ lattice points. The volume per lattice point is $V_{\\mathrm{conv}}/N_{\\mathrm{fcc}} = a^3/4$. This again matches $V_{\\mathrm{fcc,prim}}$, providing the required reconciliation.\n\nFinally, we compute the ratio $R = V_{\\mathrm{bcc,prim}}/V_{\\mathrm{fcc,prim}}$:\n$$ R = \\frac{V_{\\mathrm{bcc,prim}}}{V_{\\mathrm{fcc,prim}}} = \\frac{a^3/2}{a^3/4} = \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot \\frac{4}{1} = 2 $$\nThe ratio is a dimensionless rational number, as required. It represents the fact that the packing of lattice points in a conventional bcc cell is half as dense as in an fcc cell.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{2}$$", "id": "2811711"}, {"introduction": "A powerful concept in crystallography is the description of a crystal structure by decorating a simple lattice with a \"basis\" of atoms.

The terms Bravais lattice, basis, primitive cell, Wigner-Seitz cell, SC structure, and BCC structure are all standard. The description of a BCC structure as an SC lattice with a two-point basis is a correct and conventional textbook example used to illustrate the difference between a crystal structure and a Bravais lattice. The problem is well-posed, objective, and self-contained. All necessary information is provided, and there are no contradictions or factual errors.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. A full analysis will be performed.\n\n***\n\n**Analysis of the Proposed Structure**\n\nWe begin by constructing the set of atomic positions as defined. The Bravais lattice is simple cubic (SC) with lattice vectors $\\mathbf{R} = n_1 a \\hat{\\mathbf{x}} + n_2 a \\hat{\\mathbf{y}} + n_3 a \\hat{\\mathbf{z}}$, where $n_1, n_2, n_3$ are integers. These vectors define the vertices of a cubic grid with side length $a$.\n\nA two-point basis, $\\{\\mathbf{r}_1 = \\mathbf{0}, \\mathbf{r}_2 = \\tfrac{a}{2}(\\hat{\\mathbf{x}}+\\hat{\\mathbf{y}}+\\hat{\\mathbf{z}})\\}$, is attached to each lattice point $\\mathbf{R}$. This generates two sets of points:\n1.  Points of the form $\\mathbf{P}_1 = \\mathbf{R} + \\mathbf{r}_1 = \\mathbf{R}$. These are the original SC lattice points, which correspond to the corners of the conventional cubic cells.\n2.  Points of the form $\\mathbf{P}_2 = \\mathbf{R} + \\mathbf{r}_2 = n_1 a \\hat{\\mathbf{x}} + n_2 a \\hat{\\mathbf{y}} + n_3 a \\hat{\\mathbf{z}} + \\tfrac{a}{2}(\\hat{\\mathbf{x}}+\\hat{\\mathbf{y}}+\\hat{\\mathbf{z}})$. These points are located at the exact center of each cubic cell of the SC lattice.\n\nThe union of these two sets of points, $\\{\\mathbf{P}_1\\} \\cup \\{\\mathbf{P}_2\\}$, forms a crystal structure with atoms at all cube corners and all cube body-centers. This is precisely the definition of a body-centered cubic (BCC) structure with a conventional cubic cell of side length $a$.\n\n**Analysis of Primitiveness**\n\nA Bravais lattice is a set of points where the atomic environment around each point is identical. The BCC structure fulfills this condition; every atom sits in an identical environment. Therefore, the BCC structure is itself a Bravais lattice. The most fundamental, or primitive, description of a Bravais lattice is by a set of primitive vectors whose unit cell contains exactly one lattice point.\n\nThe description provided in the problem statement starts with an SC Bravais lattice and uses a two-point basis to generate the BCC structure. The unit cell of this underlying SC lattice is a cube of volume $V_{SC} = |(a\\hat{\\mathbf{x}}) \\cdot (a\\hat{\\mathbf{y}} \\times a\\hat{\\mathbf{z}})| = a^3$. This cell is primitive *for the SC lattice*, as it contains exactly one SC lattice point. However, when we consider the final BCC structure, this cubic cell contains two atoms: one at the corner (more precisely, $8$ corners, each shared by $8$ cells, for $8 \\times 1/8 = 1$ atom) and one at the body center.\n\nSince this cell of volume $a^3$ contains two atoms of the BCC structure, it is a *conventional* (non-primitive) cell for the BCC structure. The primitive cell of the BCC structure must contain only one atom. Its volume is thus half that of the conventional cell: $V_{p, BCC} = V_{SC} / 2 = a^3/2$.\n\nA description that uses a lattice and a multi-point basis to describe what is itself a Bravais lattice is termed a \"non-primitive\" description. The chosen SC lattice is \"coarser\" (has a larger primitive cell volume) than the true, denser BCC Bravais lattice.\n\n***\n\n**Evaluation of Options**\n\n**A. The SC lattice with the two-point basis $\\{\\mathbf{0}, \\tfrac{a}{2}(\\hat{\\mathbf{x}}+\\hat{\\mathbf{y}}+\\hat{\\mathbf{z}})\\}$ generates exactly the set of atomic positions of the BCC structure of cubic parameter $a$. The SC cubic cell of volume $a^3$ used in this description is non-primitive for BCC because the BCC primitive cell has volume $a^3/2$, so the conventional cubic cell contains $2$ BCC lattice points.**\n\nAs shown in the analysis, the SC lattice plus the given two-point basis does indeed generate the atomic positions of a BCC structure. The cubic cell of the SC lattice, with volume $a^3$, contains two atoms of the resulting structure. A primitive cell must contain only one. The volume of the BCC primitive cell is indeed $a^3/2$. The number of BCC lattice points (atoms) in the conventional cubic cell is $V_{conv}/V_{prim} = a^3 / (a^3/2) = 2$. The statement is entirely correct.\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\n**B. The same BCC structure can equally be generated by an SC lattice with two-point basis $\\{\\mathbf{0}, \\tfrac{a}{2}(\\hat{\\mathbf{x}}+\\hat{\\mathbf{y}})\\}$; therefore, BCC is not a Bravais lattice.**\n\nThis statement proposes an alternative basis, $\\{\\mathbf{0}, \\tfrac{a}{2}(\\hat{\\mathbf{x}}+\\hat{\\mathbf{y}})\\}$. Attaching this basis to an SC lattice would place atoms at the corners of the cubic cells and at the centers of the faces parallel to the $xy$-plane. This does not create a BCC structure, which requires an atom at the body center, $\\tfrac{a}{2}(\\hat{\\mathbf{x}}+\\hat{\\mathbf{y}}+\\hat{\\mathbf{z}})$. The generated structure is incorrect. Furthermore, the conclusion, \"therefore, BCC is not a Bravais lattice,\" is false. A BCC structure is one of the $14$ fundamental Bravais lattices. The ability to represent a structure with a lattice-plus-basis does not automatically disqualify it from being a Bravais lattice itself.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**C. A valid primitive set of vectors for the BCC Bravais lattice is $\\mathbf{b}_1 = \\tfrac{a}{2}(-\\hat{\\mathbf{x}}+\\hat{\\mathbf{y}}+\\hat{\\mathbf{z}})$, $\\mathbf{b}_2 = \\tfrac{a}{2}(\\hat{\\mathbf{x}}-\\hat{\\mathbf{y}}+\\hat{\\mathbf{z}})$, $\\mathbf{b}_3 = \\tfrac{a}{2}(\\hat{\\mathbf{x}}+\\hat{\\mathbf{y}}-\\hat{\\mathbf{z}})$; the primitive cell volume for these is $a^3/2$.**\n\nFirst, we verify if these vectors constitute a primitive set for BCC. They are vectors from an origin point to three of its nearest-neighbor body-center positions. Any linear combination $\\mathbf{R} = m_1 \\mathbf{b}_1 + m_2 \\mathbf{b}_2 + m_3 \\mathbf{b}_3$ with integer $m_i$ must generate all BCC points and no others. If the sum $\\sum m_i$ is even, the combination generates a corner point of the conventional lattice. If $\\sum m_i$ is odd, it generates a body-center point. For instance, $\\mathbf{b}_2+\\mathbf{b}_3 = a\\hat{\\mathbf{x}}$ (a corner point) and $\\mathbf{b}_1+\\mathbf{b}_2+\\mathbf{b}_3 = \\tfrac{a}{2}(\\hat{\\mathbf{x}}+\\hat{\\mathbf{y}}+\\hat{\\mathbf{z}})$ (a body-center point). This is a correct set of primitive vectors.\nSecond, we calculate the volume of the primitive cell: $V_p = |\\mathbf{b}_1 \\cdot (\\mathbf{b}_2 \\times \\mathbf{b}_3)|$.\n$\\mathbf{b}_2 \\times \\mathbf{b}_3 = (\\tfrac{a}{2})^2 (\\hat{\\mathbf{x}}-\\hat{\\mathbf{y}}+\\hat{\\mathbf{z}}) \\times (\\hat{\\mathbf{x}}+\\hat{\\mathbf{y}}-\\hat{\\mathbf{z}}) = \\tfrac{a^2}{4}(2\\hat{\\mathbf{y}}+2\\hat{\\mathbf{z}}) = \\tfrac{a^2}{2}(\\hat{\\mathbf{y}}+\\hat{\\mathbf{z}})$.\n$\\mathbf{b}_1 \\cdot (\\mathbf{b}_2 \\times \\mathbf{b}_3) = \\tfrac{a}{2}(-\\hat{\\mathbf{x}}+\\hat{\\mathbf{y}}+\\hat{\\mathbf{z}}) \\cdot \\tfrac{a^2}{2}(\\hat{\\mathbf{y}}+\\hat{\\mathbf{z}}) = \\tfrac{a^3}{4}(0+1+1) = \\tfrac{a^3}{2}$.\nThe volume is correct.\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\n**D. Describing BCC as an SC lattice with a two-point basis is non-primitive in the sense of lattice-plus-basis: the chosen SC Bravais lattice is coarser than the true BCC Bravais lattice, its Wigner–Seitz cell has volume $a^3$ and contains $2$ atomic sites, whereas the true BCC Bravais lattice has one atomic site per Wigner–Seitz cell of volume $a^3/2$.**\n\nThis statement accurately describes the terminology and implications. The SC description is \"non-primitive\" because the chosen unit cell (the cube) is not the smallest possible repeating unit containing one formula unit. The SC lattice is \"coarser\" because its points are less dense (primitive cell volume $a^3$) than the final BCC lattice (primitive cell volume $a^3/2$). The Wigner-Seitz cell of the underlying SC lattice has volume $a^3$ and contains one SC lattice point, to which the two-point basis is attached, so it contains $2$ atomic sites. In contrast, the Wigner-Seitz cell of the \"true\" BCC Bravais lattice is a primitive cell of volume $a^3/2$ containing one BCC lattice point (one atom). Every claim in this statement is correct.\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\n**E. The SC description with a two-point basis is primitive because each SC cell carries one basis, regardless of how many atoms the basis contains.**\n\nThis statement provides fallacious reasoning. A description is primitive if its unit cell is primitive for the *final crystal structure*. The SC cubic cell contains $2$ atoms of the BCC structure. A primitive cell for the BCC structure must contain only $1$ atom. Therefore, the SC cell is a conventional, non-primitive cell for the BCC structure. The reasoning confuses the primitiveness of the cell for the *underlying SC lattice* with the primitiveness of the cell for the *resulting BCC crystal structure*.

For the simple cubic lattice, the six perpendicular bisector planes to the vectors $\\pm a\\,\\hat{\\mathbf{x}}$, $\\pm a\\,\\hat{\\mathbf{y}}$, $\\pm a\\,\\hat{\\mathbf{z}}$ are $x=\\pm a/2$, $y=\\pm a/2$, $z=\\pm a/2$, which alone bound the Wigner–Seitz cell; planes to more distant neighbors lie outside or intersect only along edges and do not add faces.

For the body-centered cubic lattice, the eight nearest neighbors at $\\mathbf{R}=(a/2)(\\pm1,\\pm1,\\pm1)$ generate planes $x\\pm y\\pm z=\\pm 3a/4$ that truncate the corners, and the six next-nearest neighbors along $\\pm a\\,\\hat{\\mathbf{x}}$, $\\pm a\\,\\hat{\\mathbf{y}}$, $\\pm a\\,\\hat{\\mathbf{z}}$ generate the square faces $x=\\pm a/2$, $y=\\pm a/2$, $z=\\pm a/2$, producing a $14$-faced truncated octahedron of volume $a^{3}/2$, which does not coincide with the conventional cube.\n\nB. For the simple cubic lattice, the twelve face-diagonal neighbors generate additional bounding planes that cut off the cube’s corners, so the Wigner–Seitz cell is a truncated octahedron, whereas for the body-centered cubic lattice the Wigner–Seitz cell is the conventional cube because the eight body-diagonal neighbors are equidistant by symmetry.\n\nC. For both simple cubic and body-centered cubic lattices, the Wigner–Seitz cells coincide with their conventional cubic cells because each conventional cell is centered on a lattice point and thus consists of points closer to that point than to any other.\n\nD. For the simple cubic lattice, the Wigner–Seitz cell is the conventional cube. For the body-centered cubic lattice, the Wigner–Seitz cell becomes identical to the conventional cube after a translation by $(a/2,a/2,a/2)$ because both are Bravais lattices and translations preserve nearest-neighbor bisectors.\n\nE. For the simple cubic lattice, the Wigner–Seitz cell is the conventional cube. For the body-centered cubic lattice, the Wigner–Seitz cell is a rhombic dodecahedron of volume $a^{3}/2$, so it differs from the conventional cube.", "solution": "The problem statement must first be validated for scientific soundness, self-consistency, and clarity.\n\n**Step 1: Extract Givens**\n- **Lattice 1**: Simple cubic (SC) Bravais lattice.\n- The SC lattice is generated by primitive vectors $\\mathbf{a}_{1}=a\\,\\hat{\\mathbf{x}}$, $\\mathbf{a}_{2}=a\\,\\hat{\\mathbf{y}}$, $\\mathbf{a}_{3}=a\\,\\hat{\\mathbf{z}}$, where $a$ is the conventional cubic parameter.\n- **Lattice 2**: Body-centered cubic (BCC) Bravais lattice.\n- The BCC lattice has the same conventional cubic parameter $a$. Its conventional cubic cell contains lattice points at $(0,0,0)$ and $(a/2,a/2,a/2)$.\n- **Definition**: The Wigner–Seitz (WS) cell around a lattice point is the set of all points in space that are closer to that lattice point than to any other lattice point.\n- **Construction Method**: The WS cell is the intersection of the half-spaces bounded by the perpendicular bisector planes of the vectors connecting the lattice point to its neighbors.\n- **Task**: For both SC and BCC lattices, construct the WS cell, identify the neighbor shells contributing bounding planes, and determine if the WS cell shape coincides with the conventional cubic cell.\n\n**Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens**\nThe problem is scientifically grounded, being a standard exercise in solid-state physics. The definitions for the lattices and the Wigner-Seitz cell are correct and standard. The problem is well-posed, with sufficient information to derive a unique solution for the geometry of the Wigner-Seitz cells. The language is objective and precise. No flaws related to scientific unsoundness, incompleteness, ambiguity, or being ill-posed are present.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem statement is **valid**. A solution will be derived.\n\nThe Wigner-Seitz cell is constructed around a central lattice point, which we place at the origin $\\mathbf{R}_0 = (0,0,0)$. The cell consists of all points $\\mathbf{r}$ such that $|\\mathbf{r}|  |\\mathbf{r} - \\mathbf{R}|$ for all non-zero lattice vectors $\\mathbf{R}$. This condition is equivalent to the set of half-spaces defined by $\\mathbf{r} \\cdot \\mathbf{R} \\le \\frac{1}{2}|\\mathbf{R}|^2$. The boundary of the cell is formed by the set of such planes that are closest to the origin.\n\n**Analysis of the Simple Cubic (SC) Lattice**\nThe lattice points are given by vectors $\\mathbf{R} = n_1 a\\hat{\\mathbf{x}} + n_2 a\\hat{\\mathbf{y}} + n_3 a\\hat{\\mathbf{z}}$, where $n_1, n_2, n_3$ are integers.\n\n1.  **Nearest Neighbors**: The shortest non-zero lattice vectors connect the origin to its nearest neighbors. These are the $6$ vectors: $\\pm a\\hat{\\mathbf{x}}$, $\\pm a\\hat{\\mathbf{y}}$, $\\pm a\\hat{\\mathbf{z}}$. The squared magnitude of these vectors is $a^2$.\n2.  **Perpendicular Bisector Planes for Nearest Neighbors**:\n    - For $\\mathbf{R} = a\\hat{\\mathbf{x}}$, the plane equation is $\\mathbf{r} \\cdot (a\\hat{\\mathbf{x}}) = \\frac{1}{2}a^2$, which simplifies to $x = a/2$.\n    - For $\\mathbf{R} = -a\\hat{\\mathbf{x}}$, the plane is $x = -a/2$.\n    - Similarly, for $\\mathbf{R} = \\pm a\\hat{\\mathbf{y}}$ we get $y = \\pm a/2$, and for $\\mathbf{R} = \\pm a\\hat{\\mathbf{z}}$ we get $z = \\pm a/2$.\n    These $6$ planes define a cube centered at the origin, specified by the region $-a/2 \\le x \\le a/2$, $-a/2 \\le y \\le a/2$, and $-a/2 \\le z \\le a/2$.\n\n3.  **Next-Nearest Neighbors**: The next set of neighbors are at positions like $(\\pm a, \\pm a, 0)$ and its permutations. There are $12$ such vectors. Their squared magnitude is $a^2 + a^2 = 2a^2$.\n    - Let's consider the vector $\\mathbf{R} = a\\hat{\\mathbf{x}} + a\\hat{\\mathbf{y}}$. The bisector plane is $\\mathbf{r} \\cdot (a\\hat{\\mathbf{x}} + a\\hat{\\mathbf{y}}) = \\frac{1}{2}(2a^2)$, which is $x+y=a$.\n    - To determine if this plane contributes a face to the WS cell, we check if it cuts into the volume defined by the nearest-neighbor planes. The corner of the cube most in the direction of $(\\hat{\\mathbf{x}}+\\hat{\\mathbf{y}})$ is at $(a/2, a/2, z)$. At any point on this edge, $x+y=a/2+a/2=a$. The plane $x+y=a$ therefore only touches the edge of the cube. It does not reduce its volume. The same applies to all $12$ planes from the next-nearest neighbors.\n\n4.  **Conclusion for SC**: The Wigner-Seitz cell is bounded exclusively by the $6$ planes from the nearest neighbors. It is a cube of side length $a$ and volume $a^3$. The conventional cell for the SC lattice is also a cube of side length $a$. Thus, for the simple cubic lattice, the Wigner-Seitz cell and the conventional cell are identical in shape and volume, differing only by a translation.\n\n**Analysis of the Body-Centered Cubic (BCC) Lattice**\nThe BCC lattice has a basis of two atoms in its conventional cubic cell of side $a$. Taking one atom at the origin $(0,0,0)$, the set of all lattice points is given by linear combinations of primitive vectors. A simpler way for the WS construction is to list the neighbor vectors from the origin. The coordinates of lattice points relative to the origin are of the form $(n_1 a, n_2 a, n_3 a)$ and $((n_1+1/2)a, (n_2+1/2)a, (n_3+1/2)a)$.\n\n1.  **Neighbor Distances**:\n    - **Nearest Neighbors (NN)**: These are the $8$ points at the centers of the adjacent conventional cells, with vectors $\\mathbf{R}_{\\text{NN}} = \\frac{a}{2}(\\pm 1, \\pm 1, \\pm 1)$. Their squared distance from the origin is $|\\mathbf{R}_{\\text{NN}}|^2 = (a/2)^2 + (a/2)^2 + (a/2)^2 = 3a^2/4$.\n    - **Next-Nearest Neighbors (NNN)**: These are the $6$ points at the corners of the local conventional cell, with vectors $\\mathbf{R}_{\\text{NNN}} = (\\pm a, 0, 0)$, $(0, \\pm a, 0)$, $(0, 0, \\pm a)$. Their squared distance is $|\\mathbf{R}_{\\text{NNN}}|^2 = a^2$.\n    Since $3a^2/4  a^2$, the $8$ body-center vectors correspond to the nearest neighbors.\n\n2.  **Perpendicular Bisector Planes**:\n    - **Planes from NN**: For a vector $\\mathbf{R}_{\\text{NN}} = \\frac{a}{2}(l,m,n)$ where $l,m,n \\in \\{\\pm1\\}$, the plane equation is $\\mathbf{r} \\cdot \\mathbf{R}_{\\text{NN}} = \\frac{1}{2}|\\mathbf{R}_{\\text{NN}}|^2$. This becomes $\\frac{a}{2}(l x + m y + n z) = \\frac{1}{2} (3a^2/4)$, which simplifies to $l x + m y + n z = 3a/4$. There are $8$ such planes.\n    - **Planes from NNN**: For a vector $\\mathbf{R}_{\\text{NNN}} = a\\hat{\\mathbf{x}}$, the plane is $x = a/2$. There are $6$ such planes: $x=\\pm a/2$, $y=\\pm a/2$, $z=\\pm a/2$.\n\n3.  **Constructing the Cell**: The WS cell is the intersection of all half-spaces. We must determine which planes form the boundary. A plane at a distance $d$ from the origin is a candidate. The distance to the NN planes is $d_{\\text{NN}} = \\frac{|3a/4|}{\\sqrt{1^2+1^2+1^2}} = \\frac{3a}{4\\sqrt{3}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}a}{4} \\approx 0.433a$. The distance to the NNN planes is $d_{\\text{NNN}} = a/2 = 0.5a$.\n    Although the NNN planes are further away, they can still form faces of the final polyhedron. A common way to visualize the result is to start with the cube defined by the NNN planes ($-a/2 \\le x,y,z \\le a/2$) and see how it is truncated by the NN planes.\n    Consider the corner of this cube at $(a/2, a/2, a/2)$. For the NN plane $x+y+z=3a/4$, this point gives $a/2+a/2+a/2 = 3a/2$, which is greater than $3a/4$. This means the point lies outside the half-space $x+y+z \\le 3a/4$, so the plane cuts off this corner of the cube. All $8$ corners of the cube are truncated by the $8$ NN planes.\n    The resulting polyhedron is a **truncated octahedron**. It has $14$ faces: the remaining central parts of the $6$ faces of the original cube (from the NNN planes), and $8$ new faces created by the truncation (from the NN planes).\n\n4.  **Conclusion for BCC**: The Wigner-Seitz cell is a $14$-faced truncated octahedron, bounded by planes from both the $8$ nearest neighbors and the $6$ next-nearest neighbors. Its shape is not a cube and thus does not coincide with the conventional cubic cell. The volume of the primitive cell (which is the WS cell) must be the volume of the conventional cell divided by the number of lattice points per conventional cell ($2$). Therefore, the volume is $V_{WS} = a^3/2$.\n\n**Evaluation of Options**\n\n*   **A**: This option correctly states that for the SC lattice, the WS cell is a cube of side $a$ formed by the $6$ planes from nearest neighbors, which is identical in shape to the conventional cell. For the BCC lattice, it correctly identifies that both the $8$ nearest neighbors and the $6$ next-nearest neighbors contribute planes, resulting in a $14$-faced truncated octahedron. It also correctly gives the volume as $a^3/2$ and concludes that the shape does not coincide with the conventional cube. The description of plane equations and construction is physically and geometrically correct, despite a slight awkwardness in notation. **Correct**.\n\n*   **B**: This option incorrectly claims the SC Wigner-Seitz cell is a truncated octahedron and the BCC Wigner-Seitz cell is a conventional cube. Both statements are false. **Incorrect**.\n\n*   **C**: This option incorrectly claims the BCC Wigner-Seitz cell coincides with the conventional cell. The provided reasoning is flawed, as demonstrated by considering a point on the face of the conventional cell which can be closer to the body-centered lattice point than the origin. **Incorrect**.\n\n*   **D**: This option incorrectly claims the BCC Wigner-Seitz cell is a cube. The shape is a truncated octahedron. **Incorrect**.\n\n*   **E**: This option incorrectly identifies the BCC Wigner-Seitz cell as a rhombic dodecahedron. The rhombic dodecahedron is the Wigner-Seitz cell for the face-centered cubic (FCC) lattice, not the BCC lattice. **Incorrect**.\n\nBased on a rigorous derivation from first principles, Option A is the only one that presents a correct analysis for both the simple cubic and body-centered cubic lattices.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2811738"}]}
