The problem defines it as a face-centered cubic (FCC) Bravais lattice with a two-atom basis. The basis consists of a chlorine ion ($Cl^−$) at the fractional coordinate $(0,0,0)$ and a sodium ion ($Na^+$) at $(\\frac{1}{2},0,0)$. This means that for every lattice point $\\vec{R}$ of the FCC lattice, we place a $Cl^−$ ion at $\\vec{R}$ and a $Na^+$ ion at $\\vec{R} + \\vec{\\tau}_{\\mathrm{Na}}$, where $\\vec{\\tau}_{\\mathrm{Na}} = (\\frac{1}{2},0,0)a_{\\mathrm{NaCl}}$ and $a_{\\mathrm{NaCl}}$ is the side length of the conventional cubic cell.\n\nThe positions of the $Cl^−$ ions, $\\vec{P}_{\\mathrm{Cl}}$, coincide with the FCC lattice points, $\\vec{R}_{\\mathrm{FCC}}$. The positions of the $Na^+$ ions, $\\vec{P}_{\\mathrm{Na}}$, are given by $\\vec{P}_{\\mathrm{Na}} = \\vec{R}_{\\mathrm{FCC}} + \\vec{\\tau}_{\\mathrm{Na}}$. The nearest-neighbor distance, $d_{\\mathrm{NN}}(\\mathrm{NaCl})$, is the minimum distance between any $Cl^−$ ion and any $Na^+$ ion. This distance is given by the minimum magnitude of the vector difference $\\vec{P}_{\\mathrm{Na}} - \\vec{P}_{\\mathrm{Cl}}$.\n$$d_{\\mathrm{NN}}(\\mathrm{NaCl}) = \\min | \\vec{P}_{\\mathrm{Na}} - \\vec{P}_{\\mathrm{Cl}} | = \\min | (\\vec{R}_{\\mathrm{FCC}} + \\vec{\\tau}_{\\mathrm{Na}}) - \\vec{R}'_{\\mathrm{FCC}} |$$\nwhere $\\vec{R}_{\\mathrm{FCC}}$ and $\\vec{R}'_{\\mathrm{FCC}}$ are two (possibly identical) FCC lattice vectors. The difference $\\vec{R}_{\\mathrm{FCC}} - \\vec{R}'_{\\mathrm{FCC}}$ is itself an FCC lattice vector, which we can denote as $\\vec{R}''_{\\mathrm{FCC}}$. Thus, we must find the minimum length of the vectors $\\vec{R}''_{\\mathrm{FCC}} + \\vec{\\tau}_{\\mathrm{Na}}$.\n\nLet us choose a reference $Cl^−$ ion at the origin, corresponding to $\\vec{R}'_{\\mathrm{FCC}} = (0,0,0)$. We seek the $Na^+$ ion closest to this origin. The positions of the $Na^+$ ions are found by adding $\\vec{\\tau}_{\\mathrm{Na}}$ to all FCC lattice points $\\vec{R}_{\\mathrm{FCC}}$. The FCC lattice points in the conventional cell are $(0,0,0)$, and the face centers such as $(\\frac{1}{2},\\frac{1}{2},0)a_{\\mathrm{NaCl}}$, $(\\frac{1}{2},0,\\frac{1}{2})a_{\\mathrm{NaCl}}$, etc., and all integer translations.\nLet's consider possible vectors $\\vec{R}''_{\\mathrm{FCC}} + \\vec{\\tau}_{\\mathrm{Na}}$:\n1.

The lattice parameter is $a_{\\mathrm{CsCl}}$. This structure places $Cl^−$ ions at the corners of the cubic cell and a $Cs^+$ ion at the body center.\nThe positions of the $Cl^−$ ions are the SC lattice points $\\vec{R}_{\\mathrm{SC}}$.

This is the distance from a corner ion to the body-center ion.\n2.  For a neighboring lattice point, e.g., $\\vec{R}''_{\\mathrm{SC}} = (-1,0,0)a_{\\mathrm{CsCl}}$, the vector is $(-1,0,0)a_{\\mathrm{CsCl}} + (\\frac{1}{2},\\frac{1}{2},\\frac{1}{2})a_{\\mathrm{CsCl}} = (-\\frac{1}{2},\\frac{1}{2},\\frac{1}{2})a_{\\mathrm{CsCl}}$. The distance is $\\sqrt{(-\\frac{1}{2})^2 + (\\frac{1}{2})^2 + (\\frac{1}{2})^2} a_{\\mathrm{CsCl}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}a_{\\mathrm{CsCl}}$.\nThe minimum distance is along the body diagonal of the cubic cell, connecting a corner to the center.\n$$d_{\\mathrm{NN}}(\\mathrm{CsCl}) = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} a_{\\mathrm{CsCl}}$$\n\nFinally, we compute the ratio $R \\equiv \\frac{d_{\\mathrm{NN}}(\\mathrm{NaCl})}{d_{\\mathrm{NN}}(\\mathrm{CsCl})}$.\n$$R = \\frac{\\frac{1}{2}a_{\\mathrm{NaCl}}}{\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}a_{\\mathrm{CsCl}}} = \\frac{a_{\\mathrm{NaCl}}}{\\sqrt{3} a_{\\mathrm{CsCl}}}$$\nSubstituting the given numerical values, $a_{\\mathrm{NaCl}}=5.640\\,\\text{\\AA}$ and $a_{\\mathrm{CsCl}}=4.123\\,\\text{\\AA}$:\n$$R = \\frac{5.640}{\\sqrt{3} \\times 4.123}$$\nThe denominator is $\\sqrt{3} \\times 4.123 \\approx 1.73205 \\times 4.123 \\approx 7.14144$.\n$$R \\approx \\frac{5.640}{7.14144} \\approx 0.789760$$\nRounding to four significant figures as required by the problem statement, we obtain $R \\approx 0.7898$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.7898}$$", "id": "2809790"}, {"introduction": "While the atomic positions in some simple crystals are entirely fixed by symmetry, many technologically important structures, like zincblende (ZnS) or diamond, contain internal degrees of freedom.

The corresponding displacement vector is $\\mathbf{d}_1 = a(u,u,u)$.\n\nThe other three neighbors of atom $A$ at the origin are B-type atoms that are translationally equivalent to the basis atom at $a(u,u,u)$, but are located closer to other A-sites. For an atom B at fractional coordinates $(u,u,u)$, its four nearest neighbors of type A in an ideal lattice ($u=1/4$) are at fractional positions $(0,0,0)$, $(1/2,1/2,0)$, $(1/2,0,1/2)$, and $(0,1/2,1/2)$.

Let us choose $\\mathbf{d}_4 = a(u, u-1/2, u-1/2)$.\nThe cosine of the angle is given by the dot product formula:\n$\\cos\\theta(u) = \\frac{\\mathbf{d}_1 \\cdot \\mathbf{d}_4}{|\\mathbf{d}_1| |\\mathbf{d}_4|}$.\n\nThe dot product is:\n$\\mathbf{d}_1 \\cdot \\mathbf{d}_4 = a^2[u \\cdot u + u(u-1/2) + u(u-1/2)] = a^2[u^2 + 2u^2 - u] = a^2(3u^2 - u)$.\n\nThe magnitudes are:\n$|\\mathbf{d}_1| = \\sqrt{3a^2u^2} = a|u|\\sqrt{3}$.\n$|\\mathbf{d}_4| = \\sqrt{a^2(3u^2 - 2u + 1/2)} = a\\sqrt{3u^2 - 2u + 1/2}$.\n\nCombining these, we get:\n$$\n\\cos\\theta(u) = \\frac{a^2(3u^2 - u)}{a\\sqrt{3u^2} \\cdot a\\sqrt{3u^2 - 2u + 1/2}} = \\frac{3u^2 - u}{\\sqrt{3u^2(3u^2 - 2u + 1/2)}}\n$$\nFor $u > 0$, we have $|u| = u$, so the expression simplifies to:\n$$\n\\cos\\theta(u) = \\frac{3u - 1}{u\\sqrt{3(3u^2 - 2u + 1/2)}} = \\frac{3u - 1}{\\sqrt{3(3u^2 - 2u + 1/2)}}\n$$\nFor the ideal case $u=1/4$:\n$\\cos\\theta(1/4) = \\frac{3(1/4) - 1}{\\sqrt{3(3/16 - 2/4 + 1/2)}} = \\frac{-1/4}{\\sqrt{3(3/16)}} = \\frac{-1/4}{3/4} = -1/3$.\nThis corresponds to the ideal tetrahedral angle $\\theta_0 = \\arccos(-1/3) \\approx 109.47^\\circ$. The derived expression is correct.\n\nPart 3: Linearization of $\\theta(u)$ around $u_0 = 1/4$.\n\nWe want to find $\\Delta\\theta = \\theta(u) - \\theta_0$ to first order in $\\delta$, where $u = u_0 + \\delta = 1/4 + \\delta$.\nThe first-order approximation is $\\Delta\\theta \\approx \\left(\\frac{d\\theta}{du}\\right)\\bigg|_{u_0=1/4} \\delta$.\nWe start from $\\cos\\theta(u) = f(u)$, where $f(u) = \\frac{3u - 1}{\\sqrt{3(3u^2 - 2u + 1/2)}}$.\nDifferentiating with respect to $u$:\n$-\\sin\\theta(u) \\frac{d\\theta}{du} = f'(u) \\implies \\frac{d\\theta}{du} = -\\frac{f'(u)}{\\sin\\theta(u)}$.\n\nAt $u_0 = 1/4$, we have $\\theta_0 = \\arccos(-1/3)$, so $\\sin\\theta_0 = \\sqrt{1 - (-1/3)^2} = \\sqrt{1-1/9} = \\sqrt{8/9} = \\frac{2\\sqrt{2}}{3}$. Note that $\\sin\\theta_0 > 0$ as $0 < \\theta_0 < \\pi$.\n\nNext, we calculate $f'(u)$. Let $N(u) = 3u-1$ and $D(u) = \\sqrt{3(3u^2 - 2u + 1/2)}$.\n$N'(u) = 3$.\n$D^2(u) = 9u^2 - 6u + 3/2$.\n$2D(u)D'(u) = 18u - 6 \\implies D'(u) = \\frac{9u-3}{D(u)}$.\n$f'(u) = \\frac{N'(u)D(u) - N(u)D'(u)}{D^2(u)} = \\frac{3D(u) - (3u-1)\\frac{9u-3}{D(u)}}{D^2(u)} = \\frac{3D^2(u) - 3(3u-1)^2}{D^3(u)}$.\n$f'(u) = \\frac{3(9u^2 - 6u + 3/2) - 3(9u^2 - 6u + 1)}{[3(3u^2 - 2u + 1/2)]^{3/2}} = \\frac{3(3/2 - 1)}{[3(3u^2 - 2u + 1/2)]^{3/2}} = \\frac{3/2}{[3(3u^2 - 2u + 1/2)]^{3/2}}$.\nEvaluating at $u_0=1/4$:\n$f'(1/4) = \\frac{3/2}{[3(3/16 - 2/4 + 1/2)]^{3/2}} = \\frac{3/2}{[3(3/16)]^{3/2}} = \\frac{3/2}{(9/16)^{3/2}} = \\frac{3/2}{(3/4)^3} = \\frac{3}{2} \\cdot \\frac{64}{27} = \\frac{32}{9}$.\n\nNow we can find $\\frac{d\\theta}{du}$ at $u_0=1/4$:\n$\\left(\\frac{d\\theta}{du}\\right)\\bigg|_{u_0=1/4} = -\\frac{f'(1/4)}{\\sin\\theta_0} = -\\frac{32/9}{2\\sqrt{2}/3} = -\\frac{32}{9} \\cdot \\frac{3}{2\\sqrt{2}} = -\\frac{16}{3\\sqrt{2}} = -\\frac{16\\sqrt{2}}{3 \\cdot 2} = -\\frac{8\\sqrt{2}}{3}$.\n\nFinally, the first-order change in the angle $\\theta$ is:\n$\\Delta\\theta \\approx -\\frac{8\\sqrt{2}}{3}\\delta$.\n\nComment on deviations from $u=1/4$:\nIn highly symmetric crystal structures like ideal diamond (space group $Fd\\bar{3}m$) and zincblende ($F\\bar{4}3m$), atomic positions are often fixed at special Wyckoff sites without any free parameters. For zincblende, the B atom occupies the $4c$ site $(1/4, 1/4, 1/4)$. This specific value for $u$ is a direct consequence of the cubic crystal symmetry. Any deviation, $u \\neq 1/4$, would break this symmetry. From an energetic standpoint, for an unperturbed crystal, the total energy is minimized and all inter-atomic forces vanish precisely at the high-symmetry configuration, thus fixing $u=1/4$.\nDeviations from $u=1/4$ can and do occur when the crystal's symmetry is lowered by an external perturbation. Such perturbations include:\n1.  **Anisotropic strain:** Applying a strain that is not purely hydrostatic (e.g., uniaxial strain along $[111]$ or $[001]$) reduces the point group symmetry from tetrahedral ($T_d$) to a subgroup (e.g., $C_{3v}$ or $D_{2d}$). In the lower symmetry group, the atomic Wyckoff positions can gain internal degrees of freedom, allowing $u$ to relax away from $1/4$ to a new value that minimizes the total energy of the strained crystal. This phenomenon is described by internal strain parameters.\n2.  **Electric field:** In non-centrosymmetric crystals like zincblende, an applied electric field can induce relative displacements of the charged sublattices. An electric field along the $[111]$ direction, for instance, preserves $C_{3v}$ symmetry but allows for a displacement of the B sublattice relative to the A sublattice along this axis. This corresponds to a change in $u$ from $1/4$ to $1/4+\\delta$, where $\\delta$ is proportional to the electric field strength. This effect is a microscopic origin of piezoelectricity in zincblende-type materials. In the centrosymmetric diamond structure, this linear effect is forbidden by symmetry.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{-\\frac{8\\sqrt{2}}{3}\\delta}$$", "id": "2809864"}]}
