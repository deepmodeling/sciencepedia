The key principle is that the diffracted amplitude for a reflection with Miller indices $(h,k,l)$ is proportional to the structure factor $S(h,k,l)$. Since the crystal has identical scatterers located only at the Bravais lattice points, the structure factor is the lattice structure factor, which depends on the centering vectors.\n\nThe lattice structure factor is given by the sum over the $N$ lattice points in the conventional unit cell:\n$$S(h,k,l) \\propto \\sum_{j=1}^{N} \\exp[2\\pi i (h u_j + k v_j + l w_j)]$$\nwhere $(u_j, v_j, w_j)$ are the fractional coordinates of the $j$-th lattice point.

For a reflection to be present, $k$ and $l$ must also be even.\n- \"no reflections with $k$ odd are observed\": This follows directly from the condition that $k$ must be even. This is consistent.\n- \"for example, $(0,1,1)$ and $(0,1,3)$ are absent\": The indices for $(0,1,1)$ are (even, odd, odd), and for $(0,1,3)$ are (even, odd, odd). Both are mixed parity, and thus are correctly predicted to be absent.\n- \"$(0,2,0)$ and $(0,2,2)$ are present\": Indices are (even, even, even) for both. Correctly predicted present.\n(iv) Along the $\\langle hhh \\rangle$ line, \"$(1,1,1)$ is present\". The indices are (odd, odd, odd), which have the same parity. The reflection is correctly predicted to be present.\nAll observations are perfectly consistent with a face-centered lattice.\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\n**D. Base-centered $C$ (centering vector $(0,\\tfrac{1}{2},\\tfrac{1}{2})$)**\nThe terminology \"Base-centered C\" normally refers to a centering vector of $(\\frac{1}{2},\\frac{1}{2},0)$. The problem explicitly gives the centering vector as $(0,\\frac{1}{2},\\frac{1}{2})$, which corresponds to a standard A-centered lattice. We must analyze the lattice based on the given vector.\nThe lattice has two points per unit cell, at $(0,0,0)$ and $(0,\\frac{1}{2},\\frac{1}{2})$.\nThe structure factor is:\n$$S(h,k,l) \\propto 1 + \\exp\\left[2\\pi i \\left(k\\frac{1}{2} + l\\frac{1}{2}\\right)\\right] = 1 + \\exp[\\pi i (k+l)]$$\nThe condition for a reflection to be present is $k+l = 2n$ (even).\nLet's test this condition:\n(i) In the $hk0$ zone ($l=0$), the condition becomes $k+0 = 2n$, which means $k$ must be even. The observation is that \"all reflections with $h+k$ odd are absent\". However, for an A-centered lattice, a reflection such as $(1,2,0)$ is allowed since $k=2$ is even. For this allowed reflection, the sum $h+k = 1+2=3$ is odd. This contradicts the experimental observation that all such reflections are absent.\nThus, this centering type is inconsistent with the data.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\nBased on the rigorous analysis of systematic absences, only the face-centered ($F$) Bravais lattice is consistent with all the provided experimental diffraction data.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2804041"}]}
