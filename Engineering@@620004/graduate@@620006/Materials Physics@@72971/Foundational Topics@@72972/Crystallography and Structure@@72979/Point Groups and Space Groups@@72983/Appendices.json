This central atom is bonded to six identical ligand atoms `Y`. The arrangement of these `Y` atoms is described as follows:\n\nThree `Y` atoms form an equilateral triangle in the plane $z = a$ (where $a > 0$), with the triangle's center on the z-axis. We can call this the \"top\" triangle. The vertices of this top triangle, when projected onto the $xy$-plane, are at a distance $R$ from the origin and are located at azimuthal angles of $0^\\circ$, $120^\\circ$, and $240^\\circ$.\n\nThe other three `Y` atoms form a second equilateral triangle in the plane $z = -a$, also centered on the z-axis. We can call this the \"bottom\" triangle. The vertices of this bottom triangle are also at a distance $R$ from the z-axis when projected onto the $xy$-plane. However, the bottom triangle is rotated by $60^\\circ$ around the z-axis with respect to the top triangle.

Since $\\{\\phi_{k}\\}$ and $\\{\\theta_{k}\\}$ are each closed under addition of $2\\pi/3$ modulo $2\\pi$, both $T$ and $B$ are invariant as sets. Hence there is a $C_{3}$ axis along $z$.\n\n2) Absence of $C_{6}$.

Consider the plane containing the $z$-axis and the $x$-axis (the $xz$-plane), which effects $(R\\cos\\phi,\\,R\\sin\\phi,\\,z)\\mapsto(R\\cos(-\\phi),\\,R\\sin(-\\phi),\\,z)$. The top set $\\{0,\\,\\tfrac{2\\pi}{3},\\,\\tfrac{4\\pi}{3}\\}$ is invariant under $\\phi\\mapsto -\\phi$ modulo $2\\pi$, and so is the bottom set $\\{\\tfrac{\\pi}{3},\\,\\pi,\\,\\tfrac{5\\pi}{3}\\}$. By $C_{3}$, there are three such vertical planes, which are dihedral planes $\\sigma_{d}$.\n\n6) Absence of a horizontal mirror plane. Reflection in the horizontal plane $\\sigma_{h}$ maps $(x,y,z)\\mapsto(x,y,-z)$, carrying the top angles to the same azimuths at $z=-a$, but the bottom set has azimuths shifted by $\\tfrac{\\pi}{3}$. Hence $\\sigma_{h}$ is not a symmetry.\n\n7) Improper rotation $S_{6}$. The operation $S_{6}$ about $z$ is a rotation by $\\pi/3$ followed by reflection in the horizontal plane. Acting on a top atom at azimuth $\\phi$, $C_{6}$ gives $\\phi+\\tfrac{\\pi}{3}$ at $z=+a$, and $\\sigma_{h}$ then gives $z=-a$, exactly matching a bottom atom. Thus $S_{6}$ is present, as expected for $D_{3d}$.\n\nCollecting the elements: a principal $C_{3}$ axis, three $C_{2}$ axes perpendicular to it, an inversion center, three $\\sigma_{d}$ planes, and $S_{6}$ operations, with no $\\sigma_{h}$ and no $C_{6}$.

Then, using foundational facts from representation theory of finite groups (namely, that the number of inequivalent irreducible representations equals the number of conjugacy classes, that the sum of the squares of the dimensions of the irreducible representations equals the group order, and the character orthogonality relations), derive the full character table of $C_{3v}$ without assuming any specific matrix representations a priori.

It constitutes a standard, albeit non-trivial, exercise in the representation theory of finite groups, specifically applied to the point group $C_{3v}$. All necessary information is provided, the constraints are consistent, and the required methodology is based on fundamental theorems of the field. Therefore, the problem is valid, and we shall proceed with its solution.\n\nThe point group $C_{3v}$ consists of the symmetry operations that leave an ideal trigonal pyramid, such as an ammonia molecule ($NH_3$), invariant. The elements of this group are the identity operation $E$, two rotations by $\\pm \\frac{2\\pi}{3}$ about the principal axis ($C_3$ and $C_3^2 \\equiv C_3^{-1}$), and three reflections through vertical planes containing the principal axis ($\\sigma_{v1}, \\sigma_{v2}, \\sigma_{v3}$). The total number of elements, which is the order of the group, is $|G| = 1 + 2 + 3 = 6$.\n\nFirst, we must construct the conjugacy classes. A conjugacy class of an element $a \\in G$ is the set $\\{gag^{-1} | g \\in G\\}$.\n$1$. The identity element $E$ always forms its own class, as $gEg^{-1} = E$ for all $g \\in G$. So, the first class is $K_1 = \\{E\\}$, with size $h_1 = 1$.\n$2$. For the rotation $C_3$, we compute its conjugates. Rotations commute with other rotations in the same subgroup, so $C_3 C_3 C_3^{-1} = C_3$ and $C_3^2 C_3 (C_3^2)^{-1} = C_3$. However, a reflection $\\sigma_v$ transforms a rotation into its inverse: $\\sigma_v C_3 \\sigma_v^{-1} = C_3^{-1} = C_3^2$. Similarly, $\\sigma_v C_3^2 \\sigma_v^{-1} = C_3$. Thus, $C_3$ and $C_3^2$ are conjugate to each other. The second class is $K_2 = \\{C_3, C_3^2\\}$, with size $h_2 = 2$.\n$3$. For the reflections, a rotation by $C_3$ transforms one mirror plane into another. Specifically, $C_3 \\sigma_{v1} C_3^{-1} = \\sigma_{v2}$ and $C_3^{-1} \\sigma_{v1} C_3 = \\sigma_{v3}$. All three reflection planes are geometrically equivalent and are thus conjugate. The third class is $K_3 = \\{\\sigma_{v1}, \\sigma_{v2}, \\sigma_{v3}\\}$, with size $h_3 = 3$. We denote this class by its representative element, $\\sigma_v$.\nThe sum of the class sizes is $1 + 2 + 3 = 6$, which correctly equals the group order $|G|$. We have found that there are $3$ conjugacy classes.\n\nA fundamental theorem of representation theory states that the number of inequivalent irreducible representations (irreps) is equal to the number of conjugacy classes. Therefore, $C_{3v}$ has $3$ irreps.\nAnother theorem states that the sum of the squares of the dimensions ($l_i$) of the irreps is equal to the order of the group:\n$$ \\sum_{i=1}^{3} l_i^2 = |G| = 6 $$\nSince the dimensions $l_i$ must be positive integers, the only possible solution to this equation is $1^2 + 1^2 + 2^2 = 1 + 1 + 4 = 6$. Thus, the group $C_{3v}$ has two one-dimensional irreps (which we will denote $\\Gamma_{A_1}$ and $\\Gamma_{A_2}$) and one two-dimensional irrep (denoted $\\Gamma_E$).\n\nNext, we determine the characters for the one-dimensional irreps. For a $1$D irrep, the character $\\chi(g)$ is a scalar that must satisfy the group multiplication table. The group is defined by the relations $C_3^3=E$, $\\sigma_v^2=E$, and $\\sigma_v C_3 \\sigma_v = C_3^{-1}$.\nFor a $1$D irrep, these relations become:\n- $\\chi(C_3)^3 = \\chi(E) = 1$.\n- $\\chi(\\sigma_v)^2 = \\chi(E) = 1$, implying $\\chi(\\sigma_v) = \\pm 1$.\nFurthermore, any element and its inverse in the same conjugacy class must have a real-valued character for any representation. Since $C_3$ and $C_3^{-1}$ are in the same class, $\\chi(C_3)$ must be a real number. The only real number satisfying $x^3=1$ is $x=1$. Therefore, for any $1$D irrep of $C_{3v}$, $\\chi(C_3)=1$.\nThis gives two possibilities for the $1$D irreps:\n- $\\Gamma_{A_1}$: $\\chi_{A_1}(E)=1$, $\\chi_{A_1}(C_3)=1$, $\\chi_{A_1}(\\sigma_v)=1$. This is the totally symmetric representation.\n- $\\Gamma_{A_2}$: $\\chi_{A_2}(E)=1$, $\\chi_{A_2}(C_3)=1$, $\\chi_{A_2}(\\sigma_v)=-1$.\nWe can now begin construction of the character table, where rows correspond to irreps and columns to classes. The header for each class column indicates the class size $h_k$ and a representative element $g_k$.\n\n| $C_{3v}$ | $1E$ | $2C_3$ | $3\\sigma_v$ |\n| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: |\n| $A_1$ | $1$ | $1$ | $1$ |\n| $A_2$ | $1$ | $1$ | $-1$ |\n| $E$ | $l_E = 2$ | $\\chi_E(C_3)$ | $\\chi_E(\\sigma_v)$ |\n\nThe character of the identity element, $\\chi(E)$, is always equal to the dimension of the representation. So, for the $2$D irrep $\\Gamma_E$, $\\chi_E(E)=2$. Let $x = \\chi_E(C_3)$ and $y = \\chi_E(\\sigma_v)$. Since the classes $\\{C_3, C_3^2\\}$ and $\\{\\sigma_v\\}$ contain elements that are conjugate to their own inverses, their characters must be real numbers for any irrep. Thus, $x$ and $y$ are real.\n\nTo find $x$ and $y$, we apply the great orthogonality theorem for characters. The characters of two different irreps, $\\Gamma_i$ and $\\Gamma_j$, are orthogonal:\n$$ \\sum_{k} h_k \\chi_i^*(g_k) \\chi_j(g_k) = 0 \\quad (i \\neq j) $$\nLet us apply this for the pair $(\\Gamma_E, \\Gamma_{A_1})$:\n$$ (1) \\cdot \\chi_E^*(E) \\cdot \\chi_{A_1}(E) + (2) \\cdot \\chi_E^*(C_3) \\cdot \\chi_{A_1}(C_3) + (3) \\cdot \\chi_E^*(\\sigma_v) \\cdot \\chi_{A_1}(\\sigma_v) = 0 $$\n$$ (1)(2)(1) + (2)(x)(1) + (3)(y)(1) = 0 $$\n$$ 2 + 2x + 3y = 0 \\quad (1) $$\n\nNext, we apply the orthogonality for the pair $(\\Gamma_E, \\Gamma_{A_2})$:\n$$ (1) \\cdot \\chi_E^*(E) \\cdot \\chi_{A_2}(E) + (2) \\cdot \\chi_E^*(C_3) \\cdot \\chi_{A_2}(C_3) + (3) \\cdot \\chi_E^*(\\sigma_v) \\cdot \\chi_{A_2}(\\sigma_v) = 0 $$\n$$ (1)(2)(1) + (2)(x)(1) + (3)(y)(-1) = 0 $$\n$$ 2 + 2x - 3y = 0 \\quad (2) $$\n\nWe now have a system of two linear equations with two variables, $x$ and $y$:\n$1$. $2x + 3y = -2$\n$2$. $2x - 3y = -2$\nAdding equation $(1)$ and $(2)$ yields:\n$$ (2x + 3y) + (2x - 3y) = -2 + (-2) \\implies 4x = -4 \\implies x = -1 $$\nSubtracting equation $(2)$ from $(1)$ yields:\n$$ (2x + 3y) - (2x - 3y) = -2 - (-2) \\implies 6y = 0 \\implies y = 0 $$\n\nThus, the characters for the two-dimensional irreducible representation $\\Gamma_E$ are $\\chi_E(C_3)=-1$ and $\\chi_E(\\sigma_v)=0$. The complete character table is:\n| $C_{3v}$ | $1E$ | $2C_3$ | $3\\sigma_v$ |\n| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: |\n| $A_1$ | $1$ | $1$ | $1$ |\n| $A_2$ | $1$ | $1$ | $-1$ |\n| $E$ | $2$ | $-1$ | $0$ |\n\nThe problem asks specifically for the value of the character of the two-dimensional irreducible representation on a vertical mirror class, which is $\\chi_E(\\sigma_v)$.
