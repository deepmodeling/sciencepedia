It is a standard exercise in magnetothermodynamics based on established physical principles and mathematical methods. The problem provides all necessary information and is internally consistent. Therefore, it is deemed valid and a full solution will be provided.\n\nThe problem requires a thermodynamic potential with natural variables of temperature $T$ and applied magnetic field $H_m$. All quantities are per unit volume. We start from the differential form of the internal energy density $u$, which, for a magnetic system under the specified conditions (fixed volume, no other work terms), is given by the first law of thermodynamics as:\n$$\ndu = T ds + \\mu_0 H_m dM\n$$\nHere, $s$ is the entropy density, $M$ is the magnetization, and $\\mu_0$ is the magnetic constant. The natural variables for $u$ are $(s, M)$. To obtain a potential with natural variables $(T, H_m)$, we must perform a double Legendre transformation.\n\nFirst, we define the Helmholtz-like free energy density $f = u - Ts$. Its differential is:\n$$\ndf = du - Tds - sdT = (Tds + \\mu_0 H_m dM) - Tds - sdT = -s dT + \\mu_0 H_m dM\n$$\nThe natural variables of $f$ are $(T, M)$.\n\nNext, we define the Gibbs-like free energy density $g = f - \\mu_0 H_m M$. This transformation is necessary to change the natural variable from magnetization $M$ to the magnetic field $H_m$. Its differential is:\n$$\ndg = df - \\mu_0 H_m dM - \\mu_0 M dH_m = (-s dT + \\mu_0 H_m dM) - \\mu_0 H_m dM - \\mu_0 M dH_m\n$$\n$$\ndg = -s dT - \\mu_0 M dH_m\n$$\nThis free energy density $g(T, H_m)$ has the desired natural variables. The problem states as a postulate that such a function exists. The existence of $g$ as a state function implies its differential $dg$ is exact. From the differential form, we identify the partial derivatives:\n$$\ns = -\\left(\\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial T}\\right)_{H_m} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\mu_0 M = -\\left(\\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial H_m}\\right)_T\n$$\nFor an exact differential, the mixed second partial derivatives must be equal (Clairaut's theorem for equality of mixed partials):\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial H_m}\\left(\\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial T}\\right)_{H_m} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial T}\\left(\\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial H_m}\\right)_T\n$$\nSubstituting the expressions for the first derivatives gives:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial H_m}(-s)_T = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial T}(-\\mu_0 M)_{H_m}\n$$\n$$\n-\\left(\\frac{\\partial s}{\\partial H_m}\\right)_T = -\\mu_0 \\left(\\frac{\\partial M}{\\partial T}\\right)_{H_m}\n$$\nThis leads to the required Maxwell relation:\n$$\n\\left(\\frac{\\partial s}{\\partial H_m}\\right)_T = \\mu_0 \\left(\\frac{\\partial M}{\\partial T}\\right)_{H_m}\n$$\n\nThe second task is to find the isothermal entropy change, $\\Delta s$, when the magnetic field is changed quasistatically from $H_{m,1}$ to $H_{m,2}$ at a fixed temperature $T$. This change is calculated by integrating the partial derivative of entropy with respect to the magnetic field along an isotherm:\n$$\n\\Delta s = s(T, H_{m,2}) - s(T, H_{m,1}) = \\int_{H_{m,1}}^{H_{m,2}} \\left(\\frac{\\partial s}{\\partial H_m}\\right)_T dH_m\n$$\nUsing the derived Maxwell relation, this becomes:\n$$\n\\Delta s = \\int_{H_{m,1}}^{H_{m,2}} \\mu_0 \\left(\\frac{\\partial M}{\\partial T}\\right)_{H_m} dH_m\n$$\n\nNow, we specialize to the case of a Curie-Weiss paramagnet, for which the magnetization $M$ is given by the constitutive relation:\n$$\nM(T,H_m) = \\chi(T) H_m = \\frac{C}{T-\\Theta} H_m\n$$\nwhere $T > \\Theta$. We must compute the partial derivative of $M$ with respect to $T$ at fixed $H_m$:\n$$\n\\left(\\frac{\\partial M}{\\partial T}\\right)_{H_m} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial T}\\left(\\frac{C H_m}{T-\\Theta}\\right) = C H_m \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial T}\\left((T-\\Theta)^{-1}\\right)\n$$\n$$\n\\left(\\frac{\\partial M}{\\partial T}\\right)_{H_m} = C H_m \\left(-1 \\cdot (T-\\Theta)^{-2} \\cdot 1\\right) = -\\frac{C H_m}{(T-\\Theta)^2}\n$$\nWe substitute this derivative back into the integral for $\\Delta s$:\n$$\n\\Delta s = \\int_{H_{m,1}}^{H_{m,2}} \\mu_0 \\left(-\\frac{C H_m}{(T-\\Theta)^2}\\right) dH_m\n$$\nSince $\\mu_0$, $C$, $T$, and $\\Theta$ are constant with respect to the integration variable $H_m$, we can move them outside the integral:\n$$\n\\Delta s = -\\frac{\\mu_0 C}{(T-\\Theta)^2} \\int_{H_{m,1}}^{H_{m,2}} H_m dH_m\n$$\nThe integral of $H_m$ is elementary:\n$$\n\\int_{H_{m,1}}^{H_{m,2}} H_m dH_m = \\left[\\frac{1}{2}H_m^2\\right]_{H_{m,1}}^{H_{m,2}} = \\frac{1}{2}(H_{m,2}^2 - H_{m,1}^2)\n$$\nSubstituting this result back, we obtain the final closed-form expression for the isothermal entropy change per unit volume:\n$$\n\\Delta s(T) = -\\frac{\\mu_0 C}{2(T-\\Theta)^2}(H_{m,2}^2 - H_{m,1}^2)\n$$\n\nFinally, we address the minimal thermodynamic assumptions required for the isothermal entropy change to be path-independent in $H_m$. The change in entropy between two states $(T, H_{m,1})$ and $(T, H_{m,2})$ is given by $\\Delta s = s(T, H_{m,2}) - s(T, H_{m,1})$. This change is inherently path-independent if and only if entropy $s$ is a state function, meaning its value is uniquely determined by the state variables $(T, H_m)$ of the system in thermodynamic equilibrium. The minimal assumption required for this condition is the second law of thermodynamics, which posits the existence of such a state function for systems undergoing reversible processes. In the context of this problem, this is equivalent to the initial postulate that there exists a Gibbs free energy density $g(T, H_m)$ which is a state function with a continuous second derivative, from which entropy is derived as $s = -(\\partial g/\\partial T)_{H_m}$. The quasistatic nature of the process ensures the system evolves through a sequence of equilibrium states, making the integration meaningful.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{-\\frac{\\mu_0 C (H_{m,2}^{2} - H_{m,1}^{2})}{2 (T-\\Theta)^{2}}}\n$$", "id": "2840422"}, {"introduction": "Materials often display fascinating coupled-field behaviors, where, for instance, a mechanical stress can influence magnetization.
