A solution will be provided.\n\nThe derivation and calculation proceed as follows.\n\n**1. Derivation of the Total Entropy of Mixing ($\\Delta S_{\\mathrm{mix}}$)**\nThe entropy of a system is related to the number of microstates, $W$, accessible to it by the Boltzmann formula, $S = k_B \\ln W$, where $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant. The entropy of mixing, $\\Delta S_{\\mathrm{mix}}$, is the difference between the entropy of the mixed state, $S_{\\mathrm{mix}}$, and the sum of the entropies of the pure, unmixed components, $S_{A}$ and $S_{B}$.\n$$ \\Delta S_{\\mathrm{mix}} = S_{\\mathrm{mix}} - (S_A + S_B) $$\nFor the configurational entropy, the pure components exist as perfect lattices, each with only one possible spatial arrangement of its constituent particles. Thus, their configurational multiplicity is $W_A = 1$ and $W_B = 1$, leading to zero initial configurational entropy: $(S_A + S_B)_{\\text{config}} = k_B \\ln(1) + k_B \\ln(1) = 0$. The entropy of mixing is therefore equal to the configurational entropy of the final mixed state.\n\nThe number of ways to arrange $N_A$ indistinguishable particles of type $A$ and $N_B$ indistinguishable particles of type $B$ on a total of $N = N_A + N_B$ lattice sites is given by the combinatorial formula:\n$$ W = \\binom{N}{N_A} = \\frac{N!}{N_A! N_B!} $$\nThe entropy of the mixture is then:\n$$ S_{\\mathrm{mix}} = k_B \\ln W = k_B \\ln\\left(\\frac{N!}{N_A! N_B!}\\right) = k_B (\\ln(N!) - \\ln(N_A!) - \\ln(N_B!)) $$\nFor macroscopic systems, $N$, $N_A$, and $N_B$ are very large. We apply Stirling's approximation, $\\ln(z!) \\approx z \\ln z - z$ for large $z$.\n$$ S_{\\mathrm{mix}} \\approx k_B \\left[ (N \\ln N - N) - (N_A \\ln N_A - N_A) - (N_B \\ln N_B - N_B) \\right] $$\nSince $N = N_A + N_B$, the terms $-N$, $-(-N_A)$, and $-(-N_B)$ sum to zero.\n$$ S_{\\mathrm{mix}} \\approx k_B (N \\ln N - N_A \\ln N_A - N_B \\ln N_B) $$\nRearranging the terms:\n$$ S_{\\mathrm{mix}} = -k_B (N_A \\ln N_A + N_B \\ln N_B - N \\ln N) $$\n$$ S_{\\mathrm{mix}} = -k_B (N_A \\ln N_A + N_B \\ln N_B - (N_A+N_B) \\ln N) $$\n$$ S_{\\mathrm{mix}} = -k_B (N_A \\ln N_A - N_A \\ln N + N_B \\ln N_B - N_B \\ln N) $$\n$$ S_{\\mathrm{mix}} = -k_B \\left[ N_A \\ln\\left(\\frac{N_A}{N}\\right) + N_B \\ln\\left(\\frac{N_B}{N}\\right) \\right] $$\nThe ratios $\\frac{N_A}{N}$ and $\\frac{N_B}{N}$ are the particle fractions, which are identical to the mole fractions, $x_A$ and $x_B$.\n$$ S_{\\mathrm{mix}} = -k_B (N_A \\ln x_A + N_B \\ln x_B) $$\nTo express this for molar quantities, we use the relations $N_A = n_A N_{\\text{Av}}$ and $N_B = n_B N_{\\text{Av}}$, where $N_{\\text{Av}}$ is Avogadro's number. The total entropy of mixing is $\\Delta S_{\\mathrm{mix}} = S_{\\mathrm{mix}}$:\n$$ \\Delta S_{\\mathrm{mix}} = -k_B (n_A N_{\\text{Av}} \\ln x_A + n_B N_{\\text{Av}} \\ln x_B) $$\nUsing the definition of the molar gas constant, $R = k_B N_{\\text{Av}}$, we obtain the final expression for the total entropy of mixing:\n$$ \\Delta S_{\\mathrm{mix}} = -R (n_A \\ln x_A + n_B \\ln x_B) $$\n\n**2. Deduction of $\\Delta H_{\\mathrm{mix}}$ and $\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{mix}}$**\nThe problem defines an ideal solution by the condition that \"intermolecular interaction energies are composition-independent and equal for like and unlike contacts.\" This implies that the total potential energy of the system does not change upon rearranging the particles from a separated state to a mixed state. Therefore, the change in internal energy upon mixing is zero, $\\Delta U_{\\mathrm{mix}} = 0$.\nThe enthalpy of mixing is given by $\\Delta H_{\\mathrm{mix}} = \\Delta U_{\\mathrm{mix}} + P \\Delta V_{\\mathrm{mix}}$. The problem states that mixing occurs \"without volume change\", so $\\Delta V_{\\mathrm{mix}} = 0$.\nConsequently, the total enthalpy of mixing is zero:\n$$ \\Delta H_{\\mathrm{mix}} = 0 $$\nThis is the defining characteristic of an ideal solution.\n\nFor an isothermal process at constant pressure, the Gibbs free energy of mixing is given by the relation:\n$$ \\Delta G_{\\mathrm{mix}} = \\Delta H_{\\mathrm{mix}} - T \\Delta S_{\\mathrm{mix}} $$\nSubstituting the derived expressions for $\\Delta H_{\\mathrm{mix}}$ and $\\Delta S_{\\mathrm{mix}}$:\n$$ \\Delta G_{\\mathrm{mix}} = 0 - T [-R (n_A \\ln x_A + n_B \\ln x_B)] $$\n$$ \\Delta G_{\\mathrm{mix}} = RT (n_A \\ln x_A + n_B \\ln x_B) $$\nThis completes the required derivations.\n\n**3.

The problem requires us to derive expressions for these two quantities based on the provided assumptions.\n\nFirst, we address the enthalpy of mixing, $\\Delta H_{\\mathrm{mix}}$. The problem specifies the use of the regular solution model. In this model, the enthalpy of mixing arises from the interaction energies between neighboring atoms. For a binary alloy of components $A$ and $B$ with mole fractions $x$ and $1-x$ respectively, the molar enthalpy of mixing is given by the expression:\n$$\n\\Delta H_{\\mathrm{mix}}(x) = \\Omega x(1-x)\n$$\nwhere $\\Omega$ is the regular solution parameter, or interchange energy, given in units of energy per mole.\n\nNext, we derive the entropy of mixing, $\\Delta S_{\\mathrm{mix}}$.

The configurational entropy, $S_{\\mathrm{config}}$, is given by Boltzmann's equation:\n$$\nS_{\\mathrm{config}} = k_B \\ln W\n$$\nwhere $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant and $W$ is the number of distinct microscopic configurations. For a random arrangement of $N_A = xN$ atoms of type $A$ and $N_B = (1-x)N$ atoms of type $B$ on $N$ total sites, $W$ is the binomial coefficient:\n$$\nW = \\binom{N}{N_A} = \\frac{N!}{N_A!

To find the molar entropy, we divide by the number of moles, $n = N/N_{\\mathrm{Av}}$, where $N_{\\mathrm{Av}}$ is Avogadro's number.

A solution will be provided.\n\n**Derivation of the Thermodynamic Consistency Constraint**\n\nThe foundation of our analysis is the Gibbs-Duhem equation, which expresses a fundamental constraint on the variations of chemical potentials in a mixture at equilibrium. For a binary system at constant temperature $T$ and pressure $P$, the equation is:\n$$ x_A d\\mu_A + x_B d\\mu_B = 0 $$\nwhere $x_i$ is the mole fraction of component $i$ and $\\mu_i$ is its chemical potential. Let $x_A = x$, which implies $x_B = 1-x$. The Gibbs-Duhem equation can be written in terms of derivatives with respect to the single composition variable $x$:\n$$ x \\frac{d\\mu_A}{dx} + (1-x) \\frac{d\\mu_B}{dx} = 0 $$\nThis relation arises directly from the extensivity of the Gibbs free energy. The molar Gibbs free energy of the solution is $G = x\\mu_A + (1-x)\\mu_B$. Its total differential is $dG = (\\mu_A - \\mu_B)dx + x d\\mu_A + (1-x) d\\mu_B$. From the fundamental thermodynamic relation $dG = VdP - SdT + (\\mu_A-\\mu_B)dx$, at constant $T$ and $P$, we have $dG = (\\mu_A-\\mu_B)dx$. Equating these two expressions for $dG$ directly yields $x d\\mu_A + (1-x) d\\mu_B = 0$.\n\nThe chemical potential $\\mu_i$ is related to the activity $a_i$ of component $i$ by the definition:\n$$ \\mu_i(T, P, x_i) = \\mu_i^\\circ(T, P) + RT \\ln a_i $$\nwhere $\\mu_i^\\circ$ is the chemical potential in a standard state (here, the pure component $i$ at the same $T$ and $P$), and $R$ is the gas constant. Since $\\mu_i^\\circ$, $R$, and $T$ are constant under the specified conditions, the derivative of the chemical potential is:\n$$ \\frac{d\\mu_i}{dx} = RT \\frac{d(\\ln a_i)}{dx} $$\nSubstituting this into the Gibbs-Duhem equation gives:\n$$ x \\left( RT \\frac{d(\\ln a_A)}{dx} \\right) + (1-x) \\left( RT \\frac{d(\\ln a_B)}{dx} \\right) = 0 $$\nThe term $RT$ is a non-zero constant and cancels, which leaves the Gibbs-Duhem equation in terms of activities:\n$$ x \\frac{d(\\ln a_A)}{dx} + (1-x) \\frac{d(\\ln a_B)}{dx} = 0 $$\nThe activity $a_i$ is related to the mole fraction $x_i$ and the activity coefficient $\\gamma_i$ by $a_i = \\gamma_i x_i$. Taking the natural logarithm:\n$$ \\ln a_A = \\ln \\gamma_A + \\ln x $$\n$$ \\ln a_B = \\ln \\gamma_B + \\ln(1-x) $$\nNow, we differentiate these expressions with respect to $x$:\n$$ \\frac{d(\\ln a_A)}{dx} = \\frac{d(\\ln \\gamma_A)}{dx} + \\frac{1}{x} $$\n$$ \\frac{d(\\ln a_B)}{dx} = \\frac{d(\\ln \\gamma_B)}{dx} - \\frac{1}{1-x} $$\nSubstituting these derivatives back into the activity-based Gibbs-Duhem equation yields:\n$$ x \\left( \\frac{d(\\ln \\gamma_A)}{dx} + \\frac{1}{x} \\right) + (1-x) \\left( \\frac{d(\\ln \\gamma_B)}{dx} - \\frac{1}{1-x} \\right) = 0 $$\nDistributing the terms, we get:\n$$ \\left( x \\frac{d(\\ln \\gamma_A)}{dx} + 1 \\right) + \\left( (1-x) \\frac{d(\\ln \\gamma_B)}{dx} - 1 \\right) = 0 $$\nThe constant terms cancel, leaving the final form of the consistency constraint, which is the Gibbs-Duhem equation for activity coefficients:\n$$ x \\frac{d\\ln\\gamma_A}{dx} + (1-x) \\frac{d\\ln\\gamma_B}{dx} = 0 $$\nAny physically consistent model for $\\gamma_A(x)$ and $\\gamma_B(x)$ must satisfy this equation for all $x \\in (0,1)$.\n\n**Numerical Validation Procedure**\n\nTo test if a given pair of functions, $\\ln\\gamma_A(x)$ and $\\ln\\gamma_B(x)$, satisfies this constraint, we define a residual function $R(x)$:\n$$ R(x) = x \\frac{d\\ln\\gamma_A}{dx} + (1-x) \\frac{d\\ln\\gamma_B}{dx} $$\nFor a consistent model, $R(x)$ must be identically zero. Numerically, we test if its magnitude remains below a small tolerance $\\tau$ over the composition range.\n\nThe numerical procedure is as follows:\n1.  A uniform grid of $N=10001$ points, $\\{x_i\\}_{i=0}^{N-1}$, is constructed over the interval $[\\varepsilon, 1-\\varepsilon]$, where $\\varepsilon=10^{-6}$. The grid spacing is $h = \\frac{1-2\\varepsilon}{N-1}$.\n2.  The functions $\\ln\\gamma_A(x)$ and $\\ln\\gamma_B(x)$ are evaluated at each grid point $x_i$ to obtain values $\\{\\ln\\gamma_{A,i}\\}$ and $\\{\\ln\\gamma_{B,i}\\}$.\n3.  The derivatives $\\frac{d\\ln\\gamma_A}{dx}$ and $\\frac{d\\ln\\gamma_B}{dx}$ are approximated at the interior grid points ($i=1, \\dots, N-2$) using the second-order central difference formula:\n    $$ \\left. \\frac{df}{dx} \\right|_{x_i} \\approx \\frac{f(x_{i+1}) - f(x_{i-1})}{2h} = \\frac{f_{i+1} - f_{i-1}}{2h} $$\n4.  The residual $R(x_i)$ is computed for each interior point $x_i$:\n    $$ R_i = x_i \\left( \\frac{\\ln\\gamma_{A, i+1} - \\ln\\gamma_{A, i-1}}{2h} \\right) + (1-x_i) \\left( \\frac{\\ln\\gamma_{B, i+1} - \\ln\\gamma_{B, i-1}}{2h} \\right) $$\n5.  The test statistic is the maximum absolute value of the residual over all interior points:\n    $$ S = \\max_{i \\in \\{1, ..., N-2\\}} |R_i| $$\n6.  The pair of activity-coefficient functions is declared \"consistent\" if $S \\leq \\tau$, where $\\tau = 10^{-6}$, and \"inconsistent\" otherwise. The result is reported as a Boolean value.\nThis procedure will be applied to the five test cases specified in the problem.", "answer": "```python\n# The complete and runnable Python 3 code goes here.\n# Imports must adhere to the specified execution environment.\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Derives and numerically verifies the Gibbs-Duhem consistency constraint \n    for several activity coefficient models in a binary solution.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define the constants for the numerical procedure as specified.\n    N = 10001\n    epsilon = 1e-6\n    tau = 1e-6\n\n    # Define parameters for the test cases.\n    A1 = 1.7  # Case 1: Two-suffix Margules\n    A2, B2 = 1.2, 0.5  # Case 2: Three-suffix Margules\n    a3, b3 = 1.0, 2.0  # Case 3: Inconsistent model 1\n    k4 = 1.3  # Case 4: Inconsistent model 2\n    cA5, cB5 = 0.2, -0.1  # Case 5: Constant coefficients\n\n    # Define the five test cases as pairs of lambda functions for ln(gamma_A) and ln(gamma_B).\n    # Each function takes mole fraction x as input.\n    test_cases = [\n        # Case 1: Two-suffix Margules-type pair\n        (lambda x: A1 * (1 - x)**2, \n         lambda x: A1 * x**2),\n        \n        # Case 2: Three-suffix Margules-type pair\n        (lambda x: (1 - x)**2 * (A2 + 2 * (B2 - A2) * x),\n         lambda x: x**2 * (B2 + 2 * (A2 - B2) * (1 - x))),\n        \n        # Case 3: Intentional inconsistency 1\n        (lambda x: a3 * (1 - x), \n         lambda x: b3 * x),\n        \n        # Case 4: Intentional inconsistency 2\n        (lambda x: k4 * (1 - x)**2,\n         lambda x: k4 * x**3),\n        \n        # Case 5: Composition-independent (constant) coefficients\n        # Use np.ones_like to ensure the output is an array for vectorized operations.\n        (lambda x: cA5 * np.ones_like(x), \n         lambda x: cB5 * np.ones_like(x))\n    ]\n\n    results = []\n    \n    # Construct the uniform grid for the mole fraction x.\n    x_grid = np.linspace(epsilon, 1 - epsilon, N)\n    h = (1 - 2 * epsilon) / (N - 1)\n\n    for ln_gamma_A_func, ln_gamma_B_func in test_cases:\n        # Evaluate the given functions on the grid.\n        ln_ga_vals = ln_gamma_A_func(x_grid)\n        ln_gb_vals = ln_gamma_B_func(x_grid)\n\n        # Compute numerical derivatives at interior points using the\n        # second-order central difference formula.\n        d_ln_ga_dx = (ln_ga_vals[2:] - ln_ga_vals[:-2]) / (2 * h)\n        d_ln_gb_dx = (ln_gb_vals[2:] - ln_gb_vals[:-2]) / (2 * h)\n\n        # Isolate the interior grid points corresponding to the derivative values.\n        x_interior = x_grid[1:-1]\n\n        # Calculate the residual of the Gibbs-Duhem equation at each interior point.\n        # Residual(x) = x * d(ln(gamma_A))/dx + (1-x) * d(ln(gamma_B))/dx\n        residual = x_interior * d_ln_ga_dx + (1 - x_interior) * d_ln_gb_dx\n\n        # The test statistic is the maximum absolute residual.\n        max_abs_residual = np.max(np.abs(residual))\n\n        # Check for consistency by comparing the test statistic to the tolerance.\n        is_consistent = max_abs_residual = tau\n        results.append(is_consistent)\n\n    # Final print statement must produce a single-line Python-style list of Booleans.\n    # The string representation of a boolean in Python is \"True\" or \"False\".\n    # Using \", \".join followed by a replace or formatted string to match the requested output format.\n    print(f\"[{','.join(map(str, results))}]\")\n\nsolve()\n```", "id": "2859786"}]}
