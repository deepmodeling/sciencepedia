To establish a bracket $[a, b]$ where $F(a)F(b)<0$, we analyze $F(x)$.\n    - As $x \\to 0^+$, $F(x) \\to +\\infty$. So, for a small $\\epsilon > 0$, $F(\\epsilon) > 0$. We can use $\\epsilon$ as the left boundary of our search interval.\n    - The derivative $F'(x) = -\\frac{\\partial^2 g}{\\partial x^2}$. For $T<T_c$, $F'(x)$ has two roots, which are the spinodal compositions $x_{sp} = \\frac{1}{2} \\left( 1 \\pm \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{2RT}{\\Omega}} \\right)$.\n    The binodal composition $x_\\alpha$ is always less than the smaller spinodal composition, $x_{sp,1} = \\frac{1}{2} \\left( 1 - \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{2RT}{\\Omega}} \\right)$. At $x_{sp,1}$, $F'(x_{sp,1})=0$, and this point is a local minimum of $F(x)$ in $(0, 0.5)$, so $F(x_{sp,1}) < F(0.5) = 0$.\n    - Therefore, a valid search bracket for the root $x_\\alpha$ is $[\\epsilon, x_{sp,1}]$. We will use `scipy.optimize.root_scalar` with Brent's method to find the root in this interval. Once $x_\\alpha$ is found, $x_\\beta$ is simply $1-x_\\alpha$.\n    - The final compositions are rounded to $6$ decimal places as required.", "answer": "```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy.optimize import root_scalar\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves for the binodal compositions of a binary regular solution at given temperatures.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Physical constants and model parameters\n    R = 8.314  # J mol^-1 K^-1\n    Omega = 20000.0  # J mol^-1\n\n    # Test suite of temperatures in Kelvin\n    test_cases = [\n        300.0,\n        Omega / (2.0 * R),\n        1300.0\n    ]\n\n    results = []\n    epsilon = 1e-12  # Small value to avoid log(0)\n\n    # Calculate the critical temperature\n    Tc = Omega / (2.0 * R)\n\n    for T in test_cases:\n        # Case 1: Above critical temperature (single phase region)\n        # Using a small tolerance for floating point comparison with Tc\n        if T > Tc and not np.isclose(T, Tc):\n            results.append([])\n            continue\n\n        # Case 2: At or very near the critical temperature\n        if np.isclose(T, Tc):\n            results.append([0.5, 0.5])\n            continue\n\n        # Case 3: Below critical temperature (two-phase region)\n        try:\n            # The function whose root we seek for x_alpha\n            def f_to_solve(x, T_val, R_val, Omega_val):\n                # Guard against x=0 or x=1, although bracket should prevent this\n                if x <= epsilon or x >= 1.0 - epsilon:\n                    # Return a large value if outside the safe domain\n                    return np.inf if x <= epsilon else -np.inf\n                return R_val * T_val * np.log((1.0 - x) / x) - Omega_val * (1.0 - 2.0 * x)\n\n            # Determine the search bracket [a, b] for x_alpha\n            # The root x_alpha must be between 0 and the smaller spinodal composition\n            a = epsilon\n            # The smaller spinodal composition is the upper bound of the search interval\n            sqrt_term = np.sqrt(1.0 - 2.0 * R * T / Omega)\n            b = 0.5 * (1.0 - sqrt_term)\n            \n            # Use a robust root-finding algorithm (Brent's method)\n            # The bracket [a, b] ensures f(a) > 0 and f(b) < 0\n            sol = root_scalar(\n                f_to_solve,\n                args=(T, R, Omega),\n                bracket=[a, b],\n                method='brentq'\n            )\n\n            if sol.converged:\n                x_alpha = sol.root\n                x_beta = 1.0 - x_alpha\n                # Round to 6 decimal places as required\n                results.append([round(x_alpha, 6), round(x_beta, 6)])\n            else:\n                # This case should not be reached with the given valid inputs\n                results.append([])\n        \n        except (ValueError, RuntimeError):\n            # If any numerical error occurs (e.g., in sqrt), treat as no solution\n            results.append([])\n\n    # Format the final output string exactly as specified\n    output_parts = []\n    for res in results:\n        if not res:\n            output_parts.append(\"[]\")\n        else:\n            # Format numbers to ensure standard decimal representation\n            output_parts.append(f\"[{res[0]},{res[1]}]\")\n            \n    final_output_str = f\"[{','.join(output_parts)}]\"\n    print(final_output_str)\n\n\nsolve()\n```", "id": "2825878"}]}
