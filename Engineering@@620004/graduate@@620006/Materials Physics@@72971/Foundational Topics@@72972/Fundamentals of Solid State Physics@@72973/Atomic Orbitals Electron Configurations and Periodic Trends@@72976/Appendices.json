In a many-electron atom, inner electrons partially screen the nuclear charge, and within a central-field approximation the outer electron experiences an effective Coulomb attraction characterized by an effective nuclear charge $Z_{\\text{eff}}<Z$.

We must determine the total number of allowed quantum states (microstates) and the corresponding spectroscopic terms. This will be done in two ways, and the results will be cross-verified.\n\nFirst, we use a direct combinatorial approach based on the Pauli exclusion principle. An electron is characterized by a set of four quantum numbers: $n$, $l$, $m_l$, and $m_s$. For the two electrons in this problem, the principal quantum number $n$ and the orbital angular momentum quantum number $l$ are the same ($l=1$). Therefore, they are equivalent electrons. The Pauli principle dictates that no two electrons can have the same set of all four quantum numbers. This means the pair of quantum numbers $(m_l, m_s)$ must be different for each of the two electrons.\n\nFor a $p$ subshell, $l=1$. The magnetic orbital quantum number $m_l$ can take values from $-l$ to $+l$, so $m_l \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$. There are $2l+1 = 2(1)+1 = 3$ distinct spatial orbitals.\nFor an electron with spin $s=1/2$, the magnetic spin quantum number $m_s$ can take values $m_s \\in \\{-1/2, +1/2\\}$. There are $2s+1 = 2(1/2)+1 = 2$ distinct spin states, often denoted as spin-up ($\\uparrow$) and spin-down ($\\downarrow$).\n\nThe total number of available one-electron states, or spin-orbitals, is the product of the number of spatial orbitals and the number of spin states:\n$$N = (2l+1)(2s+1) = (3)(2) = 6$$\nThe problem is to determine the number of ways to place two indistinguishable fermions (the electrons) into these $N=6$ distinct spin-orbitals. According to the Pauli principle, each spin-orbital can be occupied by at most one electron. This is a classic combinatorial problem of choosing $k=2$ objects from a set of $N=6$ distinct objects, where the order of selection does not matter. The number of ways is given by the binomial coefficient $\\binom{N}{k}$:\n$$\\text{Number of microstates} = \\binom{6}{2} = \\frac{6!}{2!(6-2)!} = \\frac{6!}{2!4!} = \\frac{6 \\times 5}{2 \\times 1} = 15$$\nThere are precisely $15$ distinct antisymmetrized two-electron microstates for a $p^2$ configuration.\n\nSecond, we derive the allowed spectroscopic terms using the principles of angular momentum addition, constrained by exchange symmetry. The total wavefunction for the two-electron system, $\\Psi(1, 2)$, must be antisymmetric with respect to the interchange of the two electrons, as they are fermions: $\\Psi(1, 2) = -\\Psi(2, 1)$.\nIn the Russell-Saunders ($LS$) coupling scheme, the total wavefunction is approximated as a product of a spatial part $\\psi_{\\text{spatial}}( \\vec{r}_1, \\vec{r}_2 )$ and a spin part $\\chi_{\\text{spin}}( \\sigma_1, \\sigma_2 )$:\n$$\\Psi(1, 2) = \\psi_{\\text{spatial}} \\otimes \\chi_{\\text{spin}}$$\nFor the total wavefunction $\\Psi$ to be antisymmetric, either the spatial part is symmetric and the spin part is antisymmetric, or the spatial part is antisymmetric and the spin part is symmetric.\n\nLet us determine the total orbital angular momentum $L$ and total spin $S$.\nFor two electrons with $l_1=1$ and $l_2=1$, the possible values of the total orbital angular momentum $L$ are given by the Clebsch-Gordan series:\n$$L = |l_1 - l_2|, \\dots, l_1 + l_2 \\implies L = |1 - 1|, \\dots, 1 + 1 \\implies L = 0, 1, 2$$\nFor two electrons with $s_1=1/2$ and $s_2=1/2$, the possible values of the total spin $S$ are:\n$$S = |s_1 - s_2|, \\dots, s_1 + s_2 \\implies S = |1/2 - 1/2|, \\dots, 1/2 + 1/2 \\implies S = 0, 1$$\nThe state with $S=0$ is the spin singlet, and the state with $S=1$ is the spin triplet.\n\nNow, we must analyze the exchange symmetry of the spatial and spin wavefunctions. The exchange symmetry of a state formed by coupling two identical angular momenta $j$ to a total of $J$ is given by the factor $(-1)^{2j-J}$. For equivalent electrons, we apply this to both orbital and spin parts. The spatial wavefunctions for identical electrons have an exchange symmetry of $(-1)^{L}$. The spin wavefunctions have an exchange symmetry of $(-1)^{S+1}$ or more generally $(-1)^{s_1+s_2-S} = (-1)^{1/2+1/2-S} = (-1)^{1-S}$.\n\n-   For $L=0, 2$, the spatial wavefunction is symmetric under particle exchange.\n-   For $L=1$, the spatial wavefunction is antisymmetric under particle exchange.\n-   For $S=0$ (singlet), the spin wavefunction is antisymmetric.\n-   For $S=1$ (triplet), the spin wavefunction is symmetric.\n\nTo satisfy the Pauli principle ($\\Psi$ must be antisymmetric), we combine symmetric spatial states with antisymmetric spin states, and antisymmetric spatial states with symmetric spin states:\n1.  Symmetric spatial ($L=0, 2$) + Antisymmetric spin ($S=0$). This gives the allowed pairs $(L,S) = (0,0)$ and $(2,0)$.\n2.  Antisymmetric spatial ($L=1$) + Symmetric spin ($S=1$). This gives the allowed pair $(L,S) = (1,1)$.\n\nThe allowed spectroscopic terms, written in the standard notation ${}^{2S+1}L$, are:\n-   For $(L,S) = (0,0)$: Term is ${}^{2(0)+1}S = {}^1S$ (read as \"singlet S\").\n-   For $(L,S) = (2,0)$: Term is ${}^{2(0)+1}D = {}^1D$ (read as \"singlet D\").\n-   For $(L,S) = (1,1)$: Term is ${}^{2(1)+1}P = {}^3P$ (read as \"triplet P\").\n\nFinally, we calculate the degeneracy of each allowed term and verify that their sum equals the total number of microstates calculated earlier. The degeneracy of a term ${}^{2S+1}L$ is given by $(2S+1)(2L+1)$.\n-   Degeneracy of ${}^1S$ term ($L=0, S=0$): $(2(0)+1)(2(0)+1) = 1 \\times 1 = 1$.\n-   Degeneracy of ${}^1D$ term ($L=2, S=0$): $(2(0)+1)(2(2)+1) = 1 \\times 5 = 5$.\n-   Degeneracy of ${}^3P$ term ($L=1, S=1$): $(2(1)+1)(2(1)+1) = 3 \\times 3 = 9$.\n\nThe total number of states is the sum of the degeneracies of the allowed terms:\n$$\\text{Total Degeneracy} = 1 ({}^1S) + 5 ({}^1D) + 9 ({}^3P) = 15$$\nThis result, $15$, is identical to the number of microstates obtained from the combinatorial calculation, $\\binom{6}{2}=15$.
