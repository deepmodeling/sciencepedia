It represents a standard exercise in applying calculus to fundamental concepts of interatomic potentials in materials physics. Therefore, the problem is valid and a solution will be provided.\n\nThe pairwise potential energy $U(r)$ between two atoms is given by the generalized Mie potential:\n$$U(r) = A r^{-n} - B r^{-m}$$\nwith the given constraints $A>0$, $B>0$, and $n>m>0$. The first term $A r^{-n}$ represents a short-range repulsive interaction, while the second term $-B r^{-m}$ represents a longer-range attractive interaction. The condition $n>m$ ensures that repulsion dominates at very small separations ($r \\to 0$) and attraction dominates at larger separations, leading to a stable potential minimum.\n\nFirst, we must find the first and second derivatives of the potential $U(r)$ with respect to the interatomic distance $r$.\nThe first derivative is:\n$$U'(r) = \\frac{dU}{dr} = -n A r^{-n-1} - (-m) B r^{-m-1} = -n A r^{-n-1} + m B r^{-m-1}$$\nThe second derivative is:\n$$U''(r) = \\frac{d^2U}{dr^2} = -n(-n-1) A r^{-n-2} + m(-m-1) B r^{-m-2} = n(n+1) A r^{-n-2} - m(m+1) B r^{-m-2}$$\n\nThe equilibrium bond length, $r_0$, is found at the minimum of the potential energy curve. The condition for a potential minimum is that the first derivative is zero, $U'(r_0) = 0$, and the second derivative is positive, $U''(r_0) > 0$.\nSetting $U'(r_0) = 0$:\n$$-n A r_0^{-n-1} + m B r_0^{-m-1} = 0$$\n$$m B r_0^{-m-1} = n A r_0^{-n-1}$$\nTo solve for $r_0$, we can rearrange the equation. Assuming $r_0 \\neq 0$, we can multiply by $r_0^{n+1}$:\n$$m B r_0^{n-m} = n A$$\n$$r_0^{n-m} = \\frac{n A}{m B}$$\nThis gives the expression for the equilibrium bond length:\n$$r_0 = \\left(\\frac{n A}{m B}\\right)^{\\frac{1}{n-m}}$$\n\nTo confirm that this corresponds to a stable minimum, we must check the sign of $U''(r_0)$. From the equilibrium condition, we can express $B$ in terms of $A$: $m B = n A r_0^{-(n-m)}$. Substituting this into the expression for $U''(r)$:\n$$U''(r_0) = n(n+1) A r_0^{-n-2} - (m+1) (m B) r_0^{-m-2}$$\n$$U''(r_0) = n(n+1) A r_0^{-n-2} - (m+1) (n A r_0^{-(n-m)}) r_0^{-m-2}$$\n$$U''(r_0) = n(n+1) A r_0^{-n-2} - n(m+1) A r_0^{-n-m-m-2} = n(n+1) A r_0^{-n-2} - n(m+1) A r_0^{-n-2}$$\n$$U''(r_0) = A n r_0^{-n-2} \\left[ (n+1) - (m+1) \\right]$$\n$$U''(r_0) = A n (n-m) r_0^{-n-2}$$\nSince $A>0$, $n>0$, $r_0>0$, and it is given that $n>m$, the term $(n-m)$ is positive. Therefore, $U''(r_0) > 0$, confirming that $r_0$ corresponds to a stable equilibrium position.\n\nNext, we derive the binding energy, $D$, which is the depth of the potential well, defined as $D \\equiv |U(r_0)|$. Since we have found a stable minimum, $U(r_0)$ will be negative, so $D = -U(r_0)$.\n$$U(r_0) = A r_0^{-n} - B r_0^{-m}$$\nWe can simplify this expression by using the equilibrium condition $n A r_0^{-n} = m B r_0^{-m}$, which gives $A r_0^{-n} = \\frac{m}{n} B r_0^{-m}$.\nSubstituting this into the potential energy expression:\n$$U(r_0) = \\left(\\frac{m}{n} B r_0^{-m}\\right) - B r_0^{-m} = B r_0^{-m} \\left(\\frac{m}{n} - 1\\right) = -B r_0^{-m} \\left(\\frac{n-m}{n}\\right)$$\nThe binding energy $D$ is therefore:\n$$D = -U(r_0) = B \\left(\\frac{n-m}{n}\\right) r_0^{-m}$$\nTo express $D$ solely in terms of the initial parameters $A$, $B$, $n$, and $m$, we substitute the expression for $r_0$:\n$$D = B \\left(\\frac{n-m}{n}\\right) \\left[ \\left(\\frac{n A}{m B}\\right)^{\\frac{1}{n-m}} \\right]^{-m} = B \\left(\\frac{n-m}{n}\\right) \\left(\\frac{n A}{m B}\\right)^{-\\frac{m}{n-m}}$$\n\nFinally, we derive the dimensionless stiffness index $S(n, m)$, defined as:\n$$S(n,m) \\equiv \\frac{r_0^2 U''(r_0)}{|U(r_0)|} = \\frac{r_0^2 U''(r_0)}{D}$$\nWe have already derived expressions for the numerator and the denominator.\nNumerator: $r_0^2 U''(r_0) = r_0^2 \\left( A n (n-m) r_0^{-n-2} \\right) = A n (n-m) r_0^{-n}$.\nDenominator: $D = -U(r_0)$. Let us use an alternative form for $U(r_0)$ by substituting $B r_0^{-m} = \\frac{n}{m} A r_0^{-n}$:\n$$U(r_0) = A r_0^{-n} - \\left(\\frac{n}{m} A r_0^{-n}\\right) = A r_0^{-n} \\left(1 - \\frac{n}{m}\\right) = -A r_0^{-n} \\left(\\frac{n-m}{m}\\right)$$\nSo, the denominator is $D = A r_0^{-n} \\left(\\frac{n-m}{m}\\right)$.\nNow, we compute the ratio for $S(n,m)$:\n$$S(n,m) = \\frac{A n (n-m) r_0^{-n}}{A r_0^{-n} \\left(\\frac{n-m}{m}\\right)}$$\nThe terms $A$, $r_0^{-n}$, and $(n-m)$ cancel out, provided $n \\neq m$.\n$$S(n,m) = \\frac{n}{\\frac{1}{m}} = nm$$\nThis remarkably simple result provides insight into the nature of the bond. The index $S$ is a measure of the curvature of the potential well relative to its depth. A larger value of $S$ implies a \"sharper\" or \"narrower\" potential well for a given binding energy, which corresponds to a bond that is intrinsically stiffer.\n\nThe result $S(n,m) = nm$ shows that the intrinsic stiffness increases with both the repulsive exponent $n$ and the attractive exponent $m$. Increasing $n$ makes the repulsive wall steeper. Increasing $m$ makes the attractive force fall off more rapidly with distance, effectively making the interaction more short-ranged. Both effects contribute to a narrowing of the potential well, thus increasing the relative stiffness $S$.\nThis can be used to rationalize differences between bonding types.\n- **Primary bonds** like covalent bonds are highly directional and short-ranged, which in this model would correspond to large values for both $n$ and $m$, leading to a large $S$. This signifies a very sharp and well-defined potential minimum.\n- **Secondary bonds** like van der Waals forces are weaker and longer-ranged. The attractive part arises from induced dipoles, which typically has an $r^{-6}$ dependence, so $m=6$. The repulsive part is often modeled with $n=12$. This gives $S = 12 \\times 6 = 72$.\n- An **ionic bond** has a long-range coulombic attraction, $r^{-1}$, so $m=1$. The repulsive exponent $n$ is typically around $9$-$12$. For $n=9$, $m=1$, we get $S = 9 \\times 1 = 9$.\nThe smaller value of $S$ for the ionic bond model compared to the van der Waals model does not mean the ionic bond is weaker; to the contrary, its absolute stiffness $U''(r_0)$ and binding energy $D$ are much larger. It means that the ionic potential well is very broad relative to its depth due to the long-range $1/r$ nature of the Coulomb interaction. In contrast, the shorter-range van der Waals interaction ($1/r^6$) results in a comparatively narrower well, hence a larger value of the dimensionless index $S$. Thus, the index $S=nm$ correctly quantifies the intrinsic \"sharpness\" of the potential well as determined by the exponents of repulsion and attraction.\n\nThe final expressions for $r_0$, $D$, and $S(n,m)$ are collected for the final answer.\n$$r_0 = \\left(\\frac{nA}{mB}\\right)^{\\frac{1}{n-m}}$$\n$$D = B \\left(\\frac{n-m}{n}\\right) \\left(\\frac{nA}{mB}\\right)^{-\\frac{m}{n-m}}$$\n$$S(n,m) = nm$$", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{ \\begin{pmatrix} \\left(\\frac{nA}{mB}\\right)^{\\frac{1}{n-m}} & B\\left(\\frac{n-m}{n}\\right)\\left(\\frac{nA}{mB}\\right)^{-\\frac{m}{n-m}} & nm \\end{pmatrix} } $$", "id": "2515757"}, {"introduction": "While analytical models provide crucial insights, modern materials research relies heavily on first-principles computational methods like Density Functional Theory (DFT) to predict material properties.

It requires the calculation of the cohesive energy of an elemental solid from data obtained via Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations. All provided data points are necessary and sufficient for the derivation of a unique and physically meaningful solution. The problem is therefore deemed valid and a rigorous solution will be presented.\n\nThe cohesive energy per atom, $E_{\\text{coh}}$, is defined as the energy required to disassemble the crystal into a collection of non-interacting, ground-state neutral atoms. This corresponds to the difference between the total energy of an isolated atom in its ground state, $E_{\\text{atom}}$, and the total energy per atom of the crystal, $E_{\\text{solid}}$. The formula is thus:\n$$E_{\\text{coh}} = E_{\\text{atom}} - E_{\\text{solid}}$$\nA positive value for $E_{\\text{coh}}$ signifies that energy must be supplied to break the bonds, indicating a stable solid.

The problem states that the total energy in the limit of infinite $k$-points is lower by $0.012\\,\\mathrm{eV}$ per atom. Therefore, the correction to be applied is $\\Delta E_{k} = -0.012\\,\\mathrm{eV}$.\n\n2.  **Basis Set Superposition Error (BSSE) Correction ($\\Delta E_{\\text{BSSE}}$):** With a localized, atom-centered basis set, the basis functions of neighboring atoms can artificially lower the energy of a given atom in the crystal, an effect known as BSSE.

The problem provides that this correction increases the per-atom energy by $\\Delta E_{\\text{BSSE}} = 0.080\\,\\mathrm{eV}$.\n\nCombining these corrections, the true ground-state energy of the solid per atom is:\n$$E_{\\text{solid}} = E_{\\text{solid, raw}} + \\Delta E_{k} + \\Delta E_{\\text{BSSE}}$$\n$$E_{\\text{solid}} = -15.000\\,\\mathrm{eV} - 0.012\\,\\mathrm{eV} + 0.080\\,\\mathrm{eV} = -14.932\\,\\mathrm{eV}$$\n\nNext, we determine the ground-state energy of an isolated atom, $E_{\\text{atom}}$.

The problem defines a quantity $X_i \\equiv -\\mathrm{ICOHP}_i$, which is a positive measure of bond strength. A larger $X_i$ corresponds to a stronger bond. The harmonic approximation for lattice vibrations posits that the vibrational frequency is proportional to the square root of the force constant of the bond. Since stronger bonds have higher force constants, we expect a positive correlation between bond strength ($X_i$) and vibrational frequency ($Y_i = \\nu_i$).\n\nWe now compute the Pearson linear correlation coefficient, $r$, for the two sets of data:\n$X = \\{X_{\\mathcal{A}}, X_{\\mathcal{B}}, X_{\\mathcal{C}}\\} = \\{3.2, 2.8, 1.6\\}$\n$Y = \\{Y_{\\mathcal{A}}, Y_{\\mathcal{B}}, Y_{\\mathcal{C}}\\} = \\{1580, 1332, 520\\}$\n\nThe formula for the Pearson correlation coefficient for a sample of size $n$ is:\n$$\nr = \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^n (X_i - \\bar{X})(Y_i - \\bar{Y})}{\\sqrt{\\sum_{i=1}^n (X_i - \\bar{X})^2 \\sum_{i=1}^n (Y_i - \\bar{Y})^2}}\n$$\nWe have $n=3$ data points. First, we compute the sample means $\\bar{X}$ and $\\bar{Y}$:\n$$\n\\bar{X} = \\frac{3.2 + 2.8 + 1.6}{3} = \\frac{7.6}{3}\n$$\n$$\n\\bar{Y} = \\frac{1580 + 1332 + 520}{3} = \\frac{3432}{3} = 1144\n$$\nNext, we calculate the sum of cross-products of deviations (the numerator, $SP_{XY}$):\n$$\nX_1 - \\bar{X} = 3.2 - \\frac{7.6}{3} = \\frac{9.6-7.6}{3} = \\frac{2.0}{3}; \\quad Y_1 - \\bar{Y} = 1580 - 1144 = 436\n$$\n$$\nX_2 - \\bar{X} = 2.8 - \\frac{7.6}{3} = \\frac{8.4-7.6}{3} = \\frac{0.8}{3}; \\quad Y_2 - \\bar{Y} = 1332 - 1144 = 188\n$$\n$$\nX_3 - \\bar{X} = 1.6 - \\frac{7.6}{3} = \\frac{4.8-7.6}{3} = -\\frac{2.8}{3}; \\quad Y_3 - \\bar{Y} = 520 - 1144 = -624\n$$\n$$\nSP_{XY} = \\sum_{i=1}^3 (X_i - \\bar{X})(Y_i - \\bar{Y}) = \\left(\\frac{2.0}{3}\\right)(436) + \\left(\\frac{0.8}{3}\\right)(188) + \\left(-\\frac{2.8}{3}\\right)(-624)\n$$\n$$\nSP_{XY} = \\frac{1}{3} (872 + 150.4 + 1747.2) = \\frac{2769.6}{3} = 923.2\n$$\nNow, we compute the sums of squared deviations for $X$ ($SS_{XX}$) and $Y$ ($SS_{YY}$):\n$$\nSS_{XX} = \\sum_{i=1}^3 (X_i - \\bar{X})^2 = \\left(\\frac{2.0}{3}\\right)^2 + \\left(\\frac{0.8}{3}\\right)^2 + \\left(-\\frac{2.8}{3}\\right)^2 = \\frac{4.0 + 0.64 + 7.84}{9} = \\frac{12.48}{9}\n$$\n$$\nSS_{YY} = \\sum_{i=1}^3 (Y_i - \\bar{Y})^2 = (436)^2 + (188)^2 + (-624)^2 = 190096 + 35344 + 389376 = 614816\n$$\nFinally, we compute $r$:\n$$\nr = \\frac{SP_{XY}}{\\sqrt{SS_{XX} \\cdot SS_{YY}}} = \\frac{923.2}{\\sqrt{\\frac{12.48}{9} \\cdot 614816}} = \\frac{923.2}{\\sqrt{852544.888...}}\n$$\n$$\nr = \\frac{923.2}{923.33359...} \\approx 0.99985530\n$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures. Rounding $0.99985530$ to four significant figures gives $0.9999$. The high value confirms the strong positive linear relationship between the bond strength measure $-\\mathrm{ICOHP}$ and the vibrational frequency.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.9999}$$", "id": "2806812"}]}
