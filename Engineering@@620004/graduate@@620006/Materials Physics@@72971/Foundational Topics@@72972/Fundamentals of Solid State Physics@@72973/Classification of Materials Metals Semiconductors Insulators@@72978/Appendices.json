Classification of $n$-type versus $p$-type semiconductors:\n    The sign of the charge carrier $q$ determines the sign of $R_{H}$.\n    - For conduction dominated by electrons, the carriers are negatively charged, $q=-e$, where $e$ is the elementary positive charge. The Hall coefficient is $R_{H} = \\frac{1}{n(-e)} = -\\frac{1}{ne}$. Such a material is defined as an $n$-type semiconductor. Thus, a measured negative sign for $R_{H}$ identifies the material as $n$-type.\n    - For conduction dominated by holes, the carriers are effectively positive charges, $q=+e$. The Hall coefficient is $R_{H} = \\frac{1}{n(+e)} = +\\frac{1}{ne}$. Such a material is defined as a $p$-type semiconductor. Thus, a measured positive sign for $R_{H}$ identifies the material as $p$-type.\n    In summary, the **sign of the Hall coefficient** directly reveals the nature ($n$-type or $p$-type) of the dominant charge carriers in a semiconductor.\n\n2.  Distinguishing metals from semiconductors:\n    The magnitude of the Hall coefficient is $|R_{H}| = |\\frac{1}{nq}| = \\frac{1}{n|q|}$.\n    For a given charge carrier (e.g., electrons, where $|q|=e$), the magnitude of $R_{H}$ is inversely proportional to the carrier concentration $n$.\n    - Typical **metals** are characterized by a very high density of conduction electrons, with $n$ being on the order of the number density of atoms, roughly $n \\approx 10^{28} - 10^{29} \\, \\text{m}^{-3}$. This very large value of $n$ results in a very **small** magnitude for $R_{H}$.\n    - **Semiconductors**, by contrast, have a much lower carrier density which is highly sensitive to temperature and doping. The value of $n$ can range from $\\approx 10^{16} \\, \\text{m}^{-3}$ for intrinsic silicon at room temperature to $\\approx 10^{25} \\, \\text{m}^{-3}$ for heavily doped samples. In all cases relevant for semiconductor devices, $n$ is many orders of magnitude smaller than in a typical metal. This much smaller value of $n$ results in a much **large** magnitude for $R_{H}$.\n    Therefore, the **magnitude of the Hall coefficient** serves as a direct indicator of the carrier concentration. A small measured $|R_{H}|$ is characteristic of a metal, whereas a large $|R_{H}|$ is characteristic of a semiconductor. Measurement of $R_{H}$ is, in fact, the most common experimental method for determining the carrier density $n$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\frac{1}{nq}}\n$$", "id": "2807639"}, {"introduction": "The electronic properties of semiconductors are typically defined by intentional impurities, or dopants.

The effective Bohr radius $a_B^*$ is directly proportional to $\\varepsilon_r$. Physically, a larger $\\varepsilon_r$ indicates stronger dielectric screening of the Coulomb potential between the donor ion and the electron by the host semiconductor lattice. This weaker effective potential results in a less tightly bound electron, whose wavefunction is more spatially extended, leading to a larger $a_B^*$. Since $n_c$ is proportional to $(a_B^*)^{-3}$, it follows that $n_c \\propto \\varepsilon_r^{-3}$. Thus, a higher dielectric constant leads to a larger orbital radius, which means the orbitals will overlap at a lower donor concentration, thereby decreasing the critical density $n_c$ for the metal-insulator transition.\n\nFor the numerical evaluation, we are given $m^* = 0.25\\,m_e$ and $\\varepsilon_r = 12.0$. The problem helpfully suggests using the vacuum Bohr radius, $a_B = 5.291772109 \\times 10^{-11}\\ \\mathrm{m}$, which is defined as:\n$$a_B = \\frac{4\\pi\\varepsilon_0\\hbar^2}{m_e e^2}$$\nWe can express $a_B^*$ in terms of $a_B$ to simplify the calculation:\n$$a_B^* = \\left( \\frac{4\\pi\\varepsilon_0\\hbar^2}{m_e e^2} \\right) \\left( \\frac{\\varepsilon_r}{m^*/m_e} \\right) = a_B \\left( \\frac{\\varepsilon_r}{m^*/m_e} \\right)$$\nSubstituting the given numerical values:\n$$a_B^* = (5.291772109 \\times 10^{-11}\\ \\mathrm{m}) \\times \\left( \\frac{12.0}{0.25} \\right) = (5.291772109 \\times 10^{-11}\\ \\mathrm{m}) \\times 48.0$$\n$$a_B^* \\approx 2.54005 \\times 10^{-9}\\ \\mathrm{m}$$\nNow, we can calculate $n_c$ using $c_M = 0.26$:\n$$n_c = \\left( \\frac{c_M}{a_B^*} \\right)^{3} = \\left( \\frac{0.26}{2.54005 \\times 10^{-9}\\ \\mathrm{m}} \\right)^{3}$$\n$$n_c \\approx (1.02360 \\times 10^{8}\\ \\mathrm{m}^{-1})^{3} \\approx 1.0725 \\times 10^{24}\\ \\mathrm{m}^{-3}$$\nThe problem requires the answer in units of $\\mathrm{cm}^{-3}$. We use the conversion $1\\ \\mathrm{m} = 100\\ \\mathrm{cm}$, which implies $1\\ \\mathrm{m}^{3} = (100\\ \\mathrm{cm})^{3} = 10^{6}\\ \\mathrm{cm}^{3}$.\n$$n_c \\approx 1.0725 \\times 10^{24}\\ \\mathrm{m}^{-3} \\times \\left( \\frac{1\\ \\mathrm{m}^{3}}{10^{6}\\ \\mathrm{cm}^{3}} \\right) = 1.0725 \\times 10^{18}\\ \\mathrm{cm}^{-3}$$\nRounding the result to three significant figures, we obtain:\n$$n_c \\approx 1.07 \\times 10^{18}\\ \\mathrm{cm}^{-3}$$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{1.07 \\times 10^{18}}$$", "id": "2807647"}]}
