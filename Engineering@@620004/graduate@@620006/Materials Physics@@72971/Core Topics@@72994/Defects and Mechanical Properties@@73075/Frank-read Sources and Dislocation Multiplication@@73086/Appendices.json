We shall proceed with its solution.\n\nThe task is to derive the critical resolved shear stress, $\\tau_c$, for a Frank-Read (FR) source, and then to apply this result to compare two sources of different lengths.\n\nWe begin from fundamental principles. The force per unit length, $\\mathbf{f}$, on a dislocation line with Burgers vector $\\mathbf{b}$ and line sense vector $\\boldsymbol{\\xi}$ in a stress field described by the stress tensor $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}$ is given by the Peach-Koehler equation:\n$$ \\mathbf{f} = (\\mathbf{b} \\cdot \\boldsymbol{\\sigma}) \\times \\boldsymbol{\\xi} $$\nIn the case of a resolved shear stress $\\tau$ acting on the slip plane in the direction of $\\mathbf{b}$, this expression simplifies significantly. The force acts in the slip plane, perpendicular to the dislocation line. Its magnitude is given by:\n$$ f_{stress} = \\tau b $$\nThis force causes a pinned dislocation segment of length $L$ to bow out. The bowing is counteracted by the line tension, $T$, of the dislocation. The line tension is an effective energy per unit length, and it creates a restoring force that attempts to straighten the dislocation line. For a curved line segment with radius of curvature $R$, the restoring force per unit length due to line tension can be shown to be:\n$$ f_{tension} = \\frac{T}{R} $$\nFor the bowed dislocation to be in mechanical equilibrium, the force from the applied stress must be balanced by the restoring force from the line tension:\n$$ f_{stress} = f_{tension} $$\n$$ \\tau b = \\frac{T}{R} $$\nThis equation shows that for a given stress $\\tau$, the dislocation bows out to a specific radius of curvature $R(\\tau) = \\frac{T}{\\tau b}$. As the stress increases, the radius of curvature decreases.\n\nThe Frank-Read source operates and generates a new dislocation loop when the bowed segment becomes unstable and expands indefinitely. This critical condition is reached when the semicircular configuration is achieved. For a dislocation segment pinned at two points separated by a distance $L$, the minimum possible radius of curvature is that of a semicircle with diameter $L$. Thus, the critical radius is:\n$$ R_{min} = \\frac{L}{2} $$\nSubstituting this minimum radius into the equilibrium equation gives the critical resolved shear stress (CRSS), $\\tau_c$, required to activate the source:\n$$ \\tau_c b = \\frac{T}{R_{min}} = \\frac{T}{L/2} = \\frac{2T}{L} $$\nSolving for $\\tau_c$, we obtain the functional dependence on $T$, $b$, and $L$:\n$$ \\tau_c = \\frac{2T}{bL} $$\nThis is the first required result.\n\nThe problem provides a specific model for the line tension, $T = 0.5\\,G b^2$, where $G$ is the shear modulus. Substituting this into our expression for $\\tau_c$ gives its dependence on $G$, $b$, and $L$:\n$$ \\tau_c = \\frac{2(0.5\\,G b^2)}{bL} = \\frac{G b}{L} $$\nThis equation demonstrates that the critical stress to operate a Frank-Read source is inversely proportional to its length $L$.\n\nNext, we compute the ratio $\\tau_{c,1}/\\tau_{c,2}$ for the two given sources. The sources have pinned lengths $L_1 = 0.3\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}$ and $L_2 = 1.2\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}$. They exist in the same material, so their shear modulus $G$ and Burgers vector magnitude $b$ are identical. Consequently, their line tension $T$ is also identical.\n\nUsing the derived relation $\\tau_c = \\frac{2T}{bL}$:\nFor the first source:\n$$ \\tau_{c,1} = \\frac{2T}{bL_1} $$\nFor the second source:\n$$ \\tau_{c,2} = \\frac{2T}{bL_2} $$\nThe ratio is therefore:\n$$ \\frac{\\tau_{c,1}}{\\tau_{c,2}} = \\frac{\\left(\\frac{2T}{bL_1}\\right)}{\\left(\\frac{2T}{bL_2}\\right)} = \\frac{L_2}{L_1} $$\nThe constants $T$, $b$, and the factor of $2$ cancel, showing the ratio depends only on the lengths of the sources. Substituting the given values:\n$$ \\frac{\\tau_{c,1}}{\\tau_{c,2}} = \\frac{1.2\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}}{0.3\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}} = 4 $$\n\nFinally, we discuss the implications of this result. The relationship $\\tau_c \\propto 1/L$ signifies that longer Frank-Read sources are \"weaker,\" meaning they require a lower stress to be activated. In a real crystalline material, there exists a statistical distribution of FR source lengths. When an external stress is applied, plastic deformation via dislocation multiplication will commence when the resolved shear stress on the most favorably oriented slip systems reaches the $\\tau_c$ of the longest available sources. These weakest sources are activated first and begin to generate dislocation loops. As the applied stress is increased, shorter and shorter sources with progressively higher values of $\\tau_c$ are activated. Thus, the macroscopic yield strength of a crystalline solid is not determined by an average source strength, but is instead governed by the \"weakest links\" in the population of dislocation sources—that is, the longest Frank-Read sources present in the material. This principle is fundamental to understanding the initiation of plasticity in metals and other crystalline solids.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{4}\n$$", "id": "2825043"}, {"introduction": "Having established the basic mechanics, we now refine our model to account for a key physical reality: the anisotropy of dislocation line tension.

It is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and contains all necessary information for a unique solution. Therefore, it is deemed valid. We shall proceed with the derivation and calculation.\n\nThe problem requires us to start from two fundamental principles: the Peach-Koehler force and the static force balance on a curved dislocation.\n\nLet a dislocation line segment of length $dl$ be subjected to a resolved shear stress $\\tau$. The force acting on this segment is given by the Peach-Koehler formula. The force per unit length, $f$, on a dislocation with Burgers vector of magnitude $b$ is:\n$$\nf = \\tau b\n$$\nThis force acts perpendicular to the dislocation line, in the glide plane, and pushes the dislocation to bow out.\n\nThis outward force must be balanced by an inward force arising from the line tension, $T$, of the dislocation. For a curved line with a local radius of curvature $R$, the line tension exerts a net force per unit length, directed towards the center of curvature, given by:\n$$\nf_{T} = \\frac{T}{R}\n$$\nThe problem states we must consider a uniform line tension $T(\\chi)$ for the bowing segment, where $\\chi$ is the character angle of the initial straight segment. Thus, $T$ in the expression is $T(\\chi)$.\n\nFor static equilibrium, these two forces must balance:\n$$\n\\tau b = \\frac{T(\\chi)}{R}\n$$\nThis equation relates the applied stress $\\tau$ to the radius of curvature $R$ of the bowed-out segment. The stress can be expressed as:\n$$\n\\tau = \\frac{T(\\chi)}{bR}\n$$\nA Frank-Read source is a dislocation segment of length $L$ pinned at its ends. As the stress $\\tau$ is applied, the segment bows out, and its radius of curvature $R$ decreases. The stress required to continue the bowing increases as $R$ decreases. The minimum possible radius of curvature is achieved when the segment forms a semicircle with a diameter equal to the pinning distance $L$. In this critical configuration, the radius is $R_{crit} = L/2$. Any further infinitesimal increase in stress will cause the dislocation loop to become unstable and expand indefinitely, thereby \"operating\" the source. The stress required to reach this critical semicircular configuration is defined as the critical resolved shear stress, $\\tau_c$.\n\nSubstituting $R = L/2$ into our expression for $\\tau$ gives the critical resolved shear stress, $\\tau_c(\\chi)$:\n$$\n\\tau_c(\\chi) = \\frac{T(\\chi)}{b(L/2)} = \\frac{2 T(\\chi)}{bL}\n$$\nThis is the expression for the critical resolved shear stress in terms of the line tension $T(\\chi)$, the Burgers vector magnitude $b$, and the source length $L$. This completes the first part of the problem.\n\nNow, we must use this result to compute the specified percent change, $\\Delta$. The anisotropic line tension is given by the model:\n$$\nT(\\chi) = T_{0} \\left[1 - \\beta \\cos(2\\chi)\\right]\n$$\nwhere angles are in degrees.
