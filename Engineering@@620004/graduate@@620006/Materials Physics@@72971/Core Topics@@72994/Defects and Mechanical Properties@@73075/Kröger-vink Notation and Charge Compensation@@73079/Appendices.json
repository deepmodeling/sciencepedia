It is scientifically sound, well-posed, objective, complete, and relevant.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\n\nThe problem is **valid**. A solution will be derived.\n\n### Derivation of Correct Notation\n\nThe Kröger-Vink notation for a point defect is given by the general form $M_{S}^{C}$, where:\n*   $M$ is the chemical species occupying the site. This can be an atom (e.g., $\\mathrm{Al}$, $\\mathrm{O}$) or a vacancy ($V$).\n*   $S$ is the lattice site being occupied. This can be a regular lattice site (e.g., a $\\mathrm{Ti}$ site, denoted $\\mathrm{Ti}$) or an interstitial site (denoted $i$).\n*   $C$ is the effective charge, which is the real charge of the species $M$ minus the charge of the site $S$ in the perfect, defect-free lattice. The effective charge is represented by a superscript:\n    *   A dot ($\\bullet$) for each unit of positive effective charge.\n    *   A prime ($'$) for each unit of negative effective charge.\n    *   A cross ($\\times$) for zero effective charge (neutral).\n\nWe will now apply this formalism to each of the four cases presented in the problem statement.\n\n1.  **A substitutional dopant of aluminum ($\\mathrm{Al^{3+}}$) on a titanium site in rutile ($\\mathrm{TiO_2}$):**\n    *   The species $M$ is Aluminum, $\\mathrm{Al}$. The real charge of the aluminum ion is $+3$.\n    *   The site $S$ is a titanium site, $\\mathrm{Ti}$. In a perfect $\\mathrm{TiO_2}$ crystal, this site is occupied by a $\\mathrm{Ti^{4+}}$ ion, so the site charge is $+4$.\n    *   The effective charge $C$ is (real charge of $\\mathrm{Al}$) - (charge of $\\mathrm{Ti}$ site) = $(+3) - (+4) = -1$.\n    *   The resulting Kröger-Vink notation is $\\mathrm{Al_{Ti}^{'}}$. The effective charge is $-1$.\n\n2.  **A neutral interstitial oxygen in an oxide lattice:**\n    *   The species $M$ is Oxygen, $\\mathrm{O}$. The problem states it is \"neutral\", so its real charge is $0$.\n    *   The site $S$ is an interstitial site, $i$. An interstitial site in a perfect lattice is empty and has a charge of $0$.\n    *   The effective charge $C$ is (real charge of $\\mathrm{O}$) - (charge of interstitial site) = $(0) - (0) = 0$.\n    *   The resulting Kröger-Vink notation is $\\mathrm{O_{i}^{\\times}}$. The effective charge is $0$.\n\n3.  **The anion Frenkel interstitial in rock–salt $\\mathrm{MgO}$:**\n    *   A Frenkel defect involves an ion moving from its lattice site to an interstitial site. The problem asks for the interstitial component. The anion in $\\mathrm{MgO}$ is the oxide ion, $\\mathrm{O^{2-}}$.\n    *   The species $M$ is Oxygen, $\\mathrm{O}$. The real charge of the oxygen ion is $-2$.\n    *   The site $S$ is an interstitial site, $i$, which has a charge of $0$ in the perfect lattice.\n    *   The effective charge $C$ is (real charge of $\\mathrm{O^{2-}}$) - (charge of interstitial site) = $(-2) - (0) = -2$.\n    *   The resulting Kröger-Vink notation is $\\mathrm{O_{i}^{''}}$. The effective charge is $-2$.\n\n4.  **An A–site cation vacancy in the perovskite $\\mathrm{SrTiO_3}$:**\n    *   The perovskite structure has the general formula $\\mathrm{ABX_3}$. For $\\mathrm{SrTiO_3}$, $\\mathrm{Sr}$ is the A-site cation and $\\mathrm{Ti}$ is the B-site cation. The question specifies a vacancy on the A-site.\n    *   The species $M$ is a vacancy, $V$. A vacancy is an empty site and thus has a real charge of $0$.\n    *   The site $S$ is the A-site, which is a Strontium site, $\\mathrm{Sr}$. In a perfect lattice, this site is occupied by $\\mathrm{Sr^{2+}}$, so the site charge is $+2$.\n    *   The effective charge $C$ is (real charge of vacancy) - (charge of $\\mathrm{Sr}$ site) = $(0) - (+2) = -2$.\n    *   The resulting Kröger-Vink notation is $\\mathrm{V_{Sr}^{''}}$. The effective charge is $-2$.\n\n### Summary of Correct Descriptors\n*   Defect 1: $\\mathrm{Al_{Ti}^{'}}$; effective charge: $-1$.\n*   Defect 2: $\\mathrm{O_{i}^{\\times}}$; effective charge: $0$.\n*   Defect 3: $\\mathrm{O_{i}^{''}}$; effective charge: $-2$.\n*   Defect 4: $\\mathrm{V_{Sr}^{''}}$; effective charge: $-2$.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\nNow, we evaluate the provided options against this derived set of correct descriptors.\n\n**A.**\n*   $\\mathrm{Al_{Ti}^{'}}$; effective charge: $-1$.

No numerical evaluation is required, and no units are needed because $[X]$ is dimensionless. Provide the final expressions only; do not include intermediate steps in the final answer.", "solution": "The problem as stated is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. It presents a standard exercise in the field of defect chemistry in crystalline solids. A systematic derivation is therefore possible and required.\n\nFirst, we establish the chemical reaction for the formation of a Schottky defect pair in a binary oxide with formula unit $MO$. A Schottky defect consists of a pair of vacancies, one on the cation sublattice and one on the anion sublattice. In an oxide $MO$, the metal ion is $M^{2+}$ and the oxygen ion is $O^{2-}$. We use Kröger-Vink notation to represent the defects and their effective charges with respect to the perfect lattice.\n\nA cation vacancy, $V_{\\mathrm{M}}$, is formed by removing an $M^{2+}$ ion from a cation site. The site was occupied by a charge of $+2$, and it is now vacant (charge $0$). The effective charge of this defect is the charge of the site with the defect minus the charge of the site without the defect, which is $0 - (+2) = -2$. In Kröger-Vink notation, this is written as $V_{\\mathrm{M}}^{\\prime\\prime}$. The two prime symbols denote an effective charge of $-2$.\n\nSimilarly, an anion vacancy, $V_{\\mathrm{O}}$, is formed by removing an $O^{2-}$ ion from an anion site. The original site had a charge of $-2$. The vacant site has a charge of $0$. The effective charge is therefore $0 - (-2) = +2$. This is written as $V_{\\mathrm{O}}^{\\bullet\\bullet}$. The two bullet symbols denote an effective charge of $+2$.\n\nThe formation of one Schottky pair involves creating one cation vacancy and one anion vacancy. To conserve mass, the removed $M^{2+}$ and $O^{2-}$ ions are transferred to a sink, such as the crystal surface, where they form a new, electrically neutral $MO$ formula unit. The reaction, starting from a perfect crystal (represented by the symbol $0$ or 'null'), is:\n$$0 \\rightleftharpoons V_{\\mathrm{M}}^{\\prime\\prime} + V_{\\mathrm{O}}^{\\bullet\\bullet}$$\nThis reaction is balanced in terms of effective charge, as the sum of charges on the right side ($(-2) + (+2)$) is $0$.\n\nSecond, we apply the law of mass action to this equilibrium reaction. The equilibrium constant, denoted as $K_{S}(T)$, is given by the ratio of the product of the activities of the products to the activity of the reactant.\n$$K_{S}(T) = \\frac{a_{V_{\\mathrm{M}}^{\\prime\\prime}} \\cdot a_{V_{\\mathrm{O}}^{\\bullet\\bullet}}}{a_{0}}$$\nBy convention, the activity of the perfect crystal, $a_{0}$, is set to unity. The problem states to assume an ideal, dilute solution of defects. In this limit, the activity $a_X$ of a defect species $X$ is equal to its site fraction $[X]$. The site fraction is a dimensionless quantity, defined as the number of defects of a given type divided by the number of available sites on the corresponding sublattice. With this approximation, the mass action law becomes:\n$$K_{S}(T) = [V_{\\mathrm{M}}^{\\prime\\prime}] [V_{\\mathrm{O}}^{\\bullet\\bullet}]$$\nThe temperature dependence of $K_S(T)$ arises from its relation to the Gibbs free energy of Schottky defect formation, $\\Delta G_S$, via $K_S(T) = \\exp(-\\Delta G_S / (k_B T))$, where $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant.\n\nThird, we impose the condition of macroscopic charge neutrality. The crystal must be electrically neutral overall. This means the sum of all positive effective charges must equal the sum of all negative effective charges. Under intrinsic conditions, the only charged species considered are the Schottky defects $V_{\\mathrm{M}}^{\\prime\\prime}$ and $V_{\\mathrm{O}}^{\\bullet\\bullet}$. Let the concentrations in number per unit volume be $n_{V_{\\mathrm{M}}^{\\prime\\prime}}$ and $n_{V_{\\mathrm{O}}^{\\bullet\\bullet}}$. The neutrality condition is:\n$$(-2) \\cdot n_{V_{\\mathrm{M}}^{\\prime\\prime}} + (+2) \\cdot n_{V_{\\mathrm{O}}^{\\bullet\\bullet}} = 0$$\nThis simplifies to $n_{V_{\\mathrm{M}}^{\\prime\\prime}} = n_{V_{\\mathrm{O}}^{\\bullet\\bullet}}$. The volume concentration $n_X$ is related to the site fraction $[X]$ by $n_X = [X] \\cdot (N_{\\text{sites}}/V)_{\\text{sublattice}}$. For the stoichiometry $MO$, the number of cation sites per unit volume equals the number of anion sites per unit volume. Therefore, the equality of volume concentrations implies the equality of site fractions:\n$$[V_{\\mathrm{M}}^{\\prime\\prime}] = [V_{\\mathrm{O}}^{\\bullet\\bullet}]$$\n\nFinally, we solve for the individual defect concentrations by combining the mass action law and the charge neutrality condition. We have a system of two algebraic equations for the two unknowns, $[V_{\\mathrm{M}}^{\\prime\\prime}]$ and $[V_{\\mathrm{O}}^{\\bullet\\bullet}]$:\n1. $[V_{\\mathrm{M}}^{\\prime\\prime}] [V_{\\mathrm{O}}^{\\bullet\\bullet}] = K_{S}(T)$\n2. $[V_{\\mathrm{M}}^{\\prime\\prime}] = [V_{\\mathrm{O}}^{\\bullet\\bullet}]$\n\nSubstituting the second equation into the first gives:\n$$[V_{\\mathrm{M}}^{\\prime\\prime}] \\cdot [V_{\\mathrm{M}}^{\\prime\\prime}] = ([V_{\\mathrm{M}}^{\\prime\\prime}])^{2} = K_{S}(T)$$\nSolving for $[V_{\\mathrm{M}}^{\\prime\\prime}]$ by taking the positive square root (since concentration must be non-negative) yields:\n$$[V_{\\mathrm{M}}^{\\prime\\prime}] = \\sqrt{K_{S}(T)}$$\nFrom the charge neutrality condition, it immediately follows that the anion vacancy concentration is identical:\n$$[V_{\\mathrm{O}}^{\\bullet\\bullet}] = \\sqrt{K_{S}(T)}$$\nThese expressions represent the equilibrium site fractions for cation and anion vacancies under intrinsic Schottky-dominated conditions in an $MO$ oxide.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n[V_{\\mathrm{M}}^{\\prime\\prime}] = \\sqrt{K_S(T)} & [V_{\\mathrm{O}}^{\\bullet\\bullet}] = \\sqrt{K_S(T)}\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "2833926"}, {"introduction": "While intrinsic defects are always present, the properties of most functional materials are controlled by intentional doping with extrinsic defects.

The defect equilibrium shifts to consume oxygen vacancies and produce holes. Consequently, hole concentration significantly exceeds the concentration of doubly-charged oxygen vacancies. The charge compensation for the fixed acceptor concentration $c_A$ is dominated by holes. Mathematically, this corresponds to the approximation:\n$$[h^{\\bullet}] \\gg 2 [V_{\\mathrm{O}}^{\\bullet\\bullet}]$$\nApplying this approximation to the electroneutrality equation $(2)$ yields a simplified condition:\n$$[h^{\\bullet}] \\approx c_A$$\nThis indicates that in the oxidizing limit, the hole concentration reaches a plateau determined by the dopant concentration. This is the value requested for $[h^{\\bullet}]_{\\mathrm{plateau,ox}}$. Thus, $[h^{\\bullet}] \\propto p_{\\mathrm{O}_2}^0$, which gives the power-law exponent for the hole concentration as $\\alpha_{\\mathrm{ox}} = 0$.\n\nTo find the dependence of the minority carrier, $[V_{\\mathrm{O}}^{\\bullet\\bullet}]$, on $p_{\\mathrm{O}_2}$, we substitute the result $[h^{\\bullet}] \\approx c_A$ into the mass action law, equation $(1)$:\n$$c_A^2 \\approx K [V_{\\mathrm{O}}^{\\bullet\\bullet}] p_{\\mathrm{O}_2}^{1/2}$$\nSolving for $[V_{\\mathrm{O}}^{\\bullet\\bullet}]$ gives:\n$$[V_{\\mathrm{O}}^{\\bullet\\bullet}] \\approx \\frac{c_A^2}{K} p_{\\mathrm{O}_2}^{-1/2}$$\nThis expression shows that $[V_{\\mathrm{O}}^{\\bullet\\bullet}]$ is proportional to $p_{\\mathrm{O}_2}^{-1/2}$. Therefore, the power-law exponent for the oxygen vacancy concentration is $\\beta_{\\mathrm{ox}} = -\\frac{1}{2}$.\n\n(ii) Moderately Reducing Limit (Oxygen-Vacancy Compensation)\nIn this limit, the oxygen partial pressure is lower, causing the defect equilibrium to favor the formation of oxygen vacancies. The concentration of oxygen vacancies becomes the dominant positive charge compensating the acceptors. The approximation for this regime is:\n$$2 [V_{\\mathrm{O}}^{\\bullet\\bullet}] \\gg [h^{\\bullet}]$$\nApplying this to the electroneutrality equation $(2)$ yields:\n$$2 [V_{\\mathrm{O}}^{\\bullet\\bullet}] \\approx c_A$$\nSolving for $[V_{\\mathrm{O}}^{\\bullet\\bullet}]$ gives the plateau concentration for oxygen vacancies:\n$$[V_{\\mathrm{O}}^{\\bullet\\bullet}] \\approx \\frac{c_A}{2}$$\nThis is the value requested for $[V_{\\mathrm{O}}^{\\bullet\\bullet}]_{\\mathrm{plateau,red}}$. As this concentration is constant with respect to $p_{\\mathrm{O}_2}$ in this limit, its power-law dependence is $[V_{\\mathrm{O}}^{\\bullet\\bullet}] \\propto p_{\\mathrm{O}_2}^0$. This gives the exponent $\\beta_{\\mathrm{red}} = 0$.\n\nTo find the dependence of the minority carrier, $[h^{\\bullet}]$, on $p_{\\mathrm{O}_2}$, we substitute the result $[V_{\\mathrm{O}}^{\\bullet\\bullet}] \\approx \\frac{c_A}{2}$ into the mass action law, equation $(1)$:\n$$[h^{\\bullet}]^2 \\approx K \\left(\\frac{c_A}{2}\\right) p_{\\mathrm{O}_2}^{1/2}$$\nSolving for $[h^{\\bullet}]$ by taking the square root:\n$$[h^{\\bullet}] \\approx \\sqrt{\\frac{K c_A}{2}} p_{\\mathrm{O}_2}^{1/4}$$\nThis expression shows that $[h^{\\bullet}]$ is proportional to $p_{\\mathrm{O}_2}^{1/4}$.
