The model predicts a finite pinning strength for a solute at a distance $y=b$ from the slip plane, but an infinite pinning strength for a solute located directly on the slip plane ($y=0$). This infinite force is a non-physical artifact of the linear elastic continuum model, which treats the dislocation as a line singularity where stresses and strains diverge. In a real crystal, the dislocation has a finite-sized core region (of approximate radius a few $b$) where linear elasticity breaks down and atomistic effects dominate. The calculated force is only valid for distances $r = \\sqrt{x^2+y^2}$ significantly larger than the core radius. The comparison thus demonstrates a fundamental limitation of the linear elastic model: it provides a good description of the long-range interaction but fails to accurately predict behavior at the core. The actual pinning force for a solute at $y=0$ is finite and very strong, but its calculation requires a more sophisticated theory that accounts for the discrete atomic structure and non-linear effects within the core.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{8\\pi} \\frac{\\mu(1+\\nu)}{1-\\nu} \\frac{|\\Delta \\Omega|}{b}}\n$$", "id": "2859108"}]}
