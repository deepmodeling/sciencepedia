Using first principles of crystallography and dislocation theory, reason from the following bases:\n\n- In an fcc crystal, the close-packed slip planes are the $\\{111\\}$ family and the close-packed slip directions are the $\\langle 110 \\rangle$ family.\n- A direction $[u,v,w]$ lies in a plane $(h,k,l)$ if and only if $hu + kv + lw = 0$ in a cubic lattice.\n- A screw dislocation has local line direction $\\mathbf{t}$ parallel to $\\mathbf{b}$, and cross-slip of a screw segment can occur only onto a plane that contains the same slip direction (hence the same $\\mathbf{b}$), because the dislocation core can spread into either of the planes that contain that direction.\n\nDetermine all $\\{111\\}$ planes that contain the slip direction $[1,-1,0]$, thereby identifying the distinct cross-slip plane(s) accessible from $(111)$ for this screw segment. Then, construct the unique proper rotation in real space that preserves $\\mathbf{b}$ (i.e., a rotation about the axis $\\hat{\\mathbf{b}} = \\mathbf{b}/|\\mathbf{b}|$) and maps the unit normal of the initial plane $(111)$ to the unit normal of the identified cross-slip plane.

Do not approximate numerically.

It is scientifically grounded in established dislocation theory and the geometry of cubic crystals. All premises are factually correct, and the terminology is precise and objective. The problem provides a complete set of conditions required to determine a unique solution. It does not suffer from any listed invalidity flaws such as scientific unsoundness, ambiguity, or missing information.\n\nStep 3: Verdict and Action.\nThe problem is valid. A rigorous solution will be developed.\n\nThe solution proceeds in two stages: first, identification of the cross-slip plane, and second, determination of the required rotation angle.\n\nThe Burgers vector for the screw dislocation is $\\mathbf{b} = \\frac{a}{2}[1,-1,0]$. The slip direction is parallel to the vector component of $\\mathbf{b}$, which is $\\mathbf{d} = [1,-1,0]$. According to the problem statement, a screw dislocation can cross-slip from its initial glide plane to another plane only if that new plane also contains the slip direction, which is defined by $\\mathbf{b}$. The available slip planes are those belonging to the $\\{111\\}$ family.\n\nWe must identify which planes of the $\\{111\\}$ family contain the direction $\\mathbf{d} = [1,-1,0]$. A direction with components $[u,v,w]$ lies within a plane with Miller indices $(h,k,l)$ if the dot product of the direction vector and the plane normal vector is zero. For a cubic system, the normal to the plane $(h,k,l)$ is the vector $[h,k,l]$. The condition is thus $hu + kv + lw = 0$.\nSubstituting the components of our direction, $[u,v,w] = [1,-1,0]$, we obtain the condition for a plane $(h,k,l)$:\n$$h(1) + k(-1) + l(0) = 0$$\n$$h - k = 0 \\implies h = k$$\nWe seek planes from the $\\{111\\}$ family whose Miller indices satisfy this condition. The planes in the $\\{111\\}$ family are those with normals whose components are permutations of $\\{\\pm 1, \\pm 1, \\pm 1\\}$. The condition $h=k$ restricts our search to planes of the form $(h,h,l)$.\nThe distinct planes (noting that $(h,k,l)$ and $(\\bar{h},\\bar{k},\\bar{l})$ are parallel and thus represent the same geometric plane) satisfying this are:\n1. $(111)$\n2. $(11\\bar{1})$\nThe initial glide plane is given as $(111)$, which is consistent with our analysis. Therefore, the only other plane in the $\\{111\\}$ family onto which this screw dislocation can cross-slip is the $(11\\bar{1})$ plane.\n\nNext, we must determine the angle $\\theta$ of the rotation that maps the normal of the initial plane to the normal of the cross-slip plane, with the rotation axis being parallel to the Burgers vector direction $\\mathbf{d}$.\n\nThe rotation axis is along the unit vector $\\hat{\\mathbf{d}}$:\n$$\\hat{\\mathbf{d}} = \\frac{[1,-1,0]}{\\sqrt{1^2 + (-1)^2 + 0^2}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}[1,-1,0]$$\nThe normal to the initial plane, $P_1 = (111)$, is $\\mathbf{n}_1 = [1,1,1]$. The corresponding unit normal vector is:\n$$\\hat{\\mathbf{n}}_1 = \\frac{[1,1,1]}{\\sqrt{1^2 + 1^2 + 1^2}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}}[1,1,1]$$\nThe normal to the cross-slip plane, $P_2 = (11\\bar{1})$, is $\\mathbf{n}_2 = [1,1,-1]$. The corresponding unit normal vector is:\n$$\\hat{\\mathbf{n}}_2 = \\frac{[1,1,-1]}{\\sqrt{1^2 + 1^2 + (-1)^2}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}}[1,1,-1]$$\nThe rotation is performed about the axis $\\hat{\\mathbf{d}}$. The angle of this rotation, $\\theta$, is the angle between the projections of $\\hat{\\mathbf{n}}_1$ and $\\hat{\\mathbf{n}}_2$ onto the plane perpendicular to the rotation axis $\\hat{\\mathbf{d}}$.\nHowever, as established earlier, the slip direction $\\mathbf{d}$ lies within both slip planes. This implies that the direction vector $\\mathbf{d}$ is orthogonal to both plane normals, $\\mathbf{n}_1$ and $\\mathbf{n}_2$. We can verify this:\n$$\\mathbf{n}_1 \\cdot \\mathbf{d} = [1,1,1] \\cdot [1,-1,0] = 1 - 1 + 0 = 0$$\n$$\\mathbf{n}_2 \\cdot \\mathbf{d} = [1,1,-1] \\cdot [1,-1,0] = 1 - 1 + 0 = 0$$\nSince both normal vectors are orthogonal to the rotation axis, they lie entirely within the plane of rotation. Therefore, the angle of rotation $\\theta$ required to map $\\hat{\\mathbf{n}}_1$ to $\\hat{\\mathbf{n}}_2$ is simply the angle between the two unit vectors themselves. This angle is determined from their dot product:\n$$\\cos(\\theta) = \\hat{\\mathbf{n}}_1 \\cdot \\hat{\\mathbf{n}}_2$$\n$$\\cos(\\theta) = \\left(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}}[1,1,1]\\right) \\cdot \\left(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}}[1,1,-1]\\right) = \\frac{1}{3} \\left( (1)(1) + (1)(1) + (1)(-1) \\right)$$\n$$\\cos(\\theta) = \\frac{1}{3}(1+1-1) = \\frac{1}{3}$$\nThe problem asks for the angle $\\theta$ in the range $[0,\\pi]$. This is found by taking the inverse cosine:\n$$\\theta = \\arccos\\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right)$$\nThis is the exact, closed-form analytical expression for the required rotation angle magnitude.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\arccos\\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right)}$$", "id": "2815189"}, {"introduction": "While geometry dictates the possible paths for dislocation motion, mechanics determines the driving force.

We can write the strain rate equation for both states:\n$$ \\dot{\\gamma}_{1} = \\dot{\\gamma}_{0} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta G(\\tau_{1})}{k_{B}T}\\right) $$\n$$ \\dot{\\gamma}_{2} = \\dot{\\gamma}_{0} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta G(\\tau_{2})}{k_{B}T}\\right) $$\nTaking the ratio of these two equations eliminates the pre-factor $\\dot{\\gamma}_{0}$:\n$$ \\frac{\\dot{\\gamma}_{2}}{\\dot{\\gamma}_{1}} = \\frac{\\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta G(\\tau_{2})}{k_{B}T}\\right)}{\\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta G(\\tau_{1})}{k_{B}T}\\right)} = \\exp\\left(\\frac{\\Delta G(\\tau_{1}) - \\Delta G(\\tau_{2})}{k_{B}T}\\right) $$\nSubstituting the expression for the change in activation energy, we get:\n$$ \\frac{\\dot{\\gamma}_{2}}{\\dot{\\gamma}_{1}} = \\exp\\left(\\frac{V^{\\ast}\\Delta \\tau}{k_{B}T}\\right) $$\nTaking the natural logarithm of both sides and solving for the change in resolved shear stress $\\Delta \\tau$:\n$$ \\ln\\left(\\frac{\\dot{\\gamma}_{2}}{\\dot{\\gamma}_{1}}\\right) = \\frac{V^{\\ast}\\Delta \\tau}{k_{B}T} $$\n$$ \\Delta \\tau = \\frac{k_{B}T}{V^{\\ast}} \\ln\\left(\\frac{\\dot{\\gamma}_{2}}{\\dot{\\gamma}_{1}}\\right) $$\nThe problem provides relationships between axial stress/strain rate ($\\sigma$, $\\dot{\\epsilon}$) and shear stress/strain rate ($\\tau$, $\\dot{\\gamma}$):\n$$ \\tau = m_{s}\\sigma \\implies \\Delta \\tau = m_{s}\\Delta \\sigma $$\n$$ \\dot{\\gamma} = \\frac{\\dot{\\epsilon}}{m_{s}} \\implies \\frac{\\dot{\\gamma}_{2}}{\\dot{\\gamma}_{1}} = \\frac{\\dot{\\epsilon}_{2}/m_{s}}{\\dot{\\epsilon}_{1}/m_{s}} = \\frac{\\dot{\\epsilon}_{2}}{\\dot{\\epsilon}_{1}} $$\nSubstituting these into the equation for $\\Delta \\tau$:\n$$ m_{s}\\Delta\\sigma = \\frac{k_{B}T}{V^{\\ast}} \\ln\\left(\\frac{\\dot{\\epsilon}_{2}}{\\dot{\\epsilon}_{1}}\\right) $$\nSolving for the change in axial flow stress, $\\Delta\\sigma$:\n$$ \\Delta\\sigma = \\frac{k_{B}T}{m_{s}V^{\\ast}} \\ln\\left(\\frac{\\dot{\\epsilon}_{2}}{\\dot{\\epsilon}_{1}}\\right) $$\nWe are given the following values:\n$k_{B} \\approx 1.380649 \\times 10^{-23} \\, \\text{J}\\cdot\\text{K}^{-1}$\n$T = 300 \\, \\text{K}$\n$m_{s} = 0.50$\n$b = 0.25 \\, \\text{nm} = 0.25 \\times 10^{-9} \\, \\text{m}$\n$\\dot{\\epsilon}_{1} = 1.0 \\times 10^{-5} \\, \\text{s}^{-1}$\n$\\dot{\\epsilon}_{2} = 1.0 \\times 10^{-3} \\, \\text{s}^{-1}$\n\nFirst, calculate the constant terms:\nThe thermal energy is $k_{B}T = (1.380649 \\times 10^{-23} \\, \\text{J}\\cdot\\text{K}^{-1}) \\times (300 \\, \\text{K}) \\approx 4.141947 \\times 10^{-21} \\, \\text{J}$.\nThe logarithm of the strain rate ratio is $\\ln\\left(\\frac{\\dot{\\epsilon}_{2}}{\\dot{\\epsilon}_{1}}\\right) = \\ln\\left(\\frac{1.0 \\times 10^{-3}}{1.0 \\times 10^{-5}}\\right) = \\ln(100) \\approx 4.60517$.\nThe cube of the Burgers vector is $b^{3} = (0.25 \\times 10^{-9} \\, \\text{m})^{3} = 1.5625 \\times 10^{-29} \\, \\text{m}^{3}$.\n\nCase 1: Cross-slip controlled glide\nThe activation volume is $V^{\\ast}_{\\mathrm{cs}} = 20\\,b^{3} = 20 \\times (1.5625 \\times 10^{-29} \\, \\text{m}^{3}) = 3.125 \\times 10^{-28} \\, \\text{m}^{3}$.\nThe change in axial stress is:\n$$ \\Delta\\sigma_{\\mathrm{cs}} = \\frac{4.141947 \\times 10^{-21} \\, \\text{J}}{(0.50) \\times (3.125 \\times 10^{-28} \\, \\text{m}^{3})} \\times 4.60517 $$\n$$ \\Delta\\sigma_{\\mathrm{cs}} \\approx \\frac{4.141947 \\times 10^{-21}}{1.5625 \\times 10^{-28}} \\times 4.60517 \\,\\, \\text{Pa} $$\n$$ \\Delta\\sigma_{\\mathrm{cs}} \\approx (2.650846 \\times 10^{7}) \\times 4.60517 \\,\\, \\text{Pa} \\approx 1.22076 \\times 10^{8} \\, \\text{Pa} $$\nConverting to megapascals ($1 \\, \\text{MPa} = 10^{6} \\, \\text{Pa}$):\n$$ \\Delta\\sigma_{\\mathrm{cs}} \\approx 122.076 \\, \\text{MPa} $$\nRounding to four significant figures, $\\Delta\\sigma_{\\mathrm{cs}} = 122.1 \\, \\text{MPa}$.\n\nCase 2: Kink-pair nucleation controlled glide\nThe activation volume is $V^{\\ast}_{\\mathrm{kp}} = 200\\,b^{3} = 200 \\times (1.5625 \\times 10^{-29} \\, \\text{m}^{3}) = 3.125 \\times 10^{-27} \\, \\text{m}^{3}$.\nThe change in axial stress is:\n$$ \\Delta\\sigma_{\\mathrm{kp}} = \\frac{4.141947 \\times 10^{-21} \\, \\text{J}}{(0.50) \\times (3.125 \\times 10^{-27} \\, \\text{m}^{3})} \\times 4.60517 $$\n$$ \\Delta\\sigma_{\\mathrm{kp}} \\approx \\frac{4.141947 \\times 10^{-21}}{1.5625 \\times 10^{-27}} \\times 4.60517 \\,\\, \\text{Pa} $$\n$$ \\Delta\\sigma_{\\mathrm{kp}} \\approx (2.650846 \\times 10^{6}) \\times 4.60517 \\,\\, \\text{Pa} \\approx 1.22076 \\times 10^{7} \\, \\text{Pa} $$\nConverting to megapascals:\n$$ \\Delta\\sigma_{\\mathrm{kp}} \\approx 12.2076 \\, \\text{MPa} $$\nRounding to four significant figures, $\\Delta\\sigma_{\\mathrm{kp}} = 12.21 \\, \\text{MPa}$.\n\nThe calculated values represent the instantaneous increase in flow stress required to accommodate a $100$-fold increase in plastic strain rate for the two different controlling mechanisms.
