This significantly underestimates the energetic stabilization and would require the logarithmic factor to be about half the computed values; it commonly results from forgetting the degeneracy factor $z$ and the oxygen-site normalization, or from using base-$10$ logarithms instead of natural logarithms.\n- B. $0.30\\,\\mathrm{eV}$ — Incorrect. A value near $0.30\\,\\mathrm{eV}$ is obtained if one ignores depletion of the free-vacancy pool by complexes, i.e., replacing $\\left(\\frac{1}{2} - f\\right)$ by the constant $\\frac{1}{2}$ in the expression, which violates conservation of vacancies at finite $f$.\n- C. $0.40\\,\\mathrm{eV}$ — Correct. This value follows from a first-principles balance of Boltzmann weighting, the $z$-fold configurational degeneracy of nearest-neighbor sites, and conservation of total vacancies and acceptors.\n- D. $0.60\\,\\mathrm{eV}$ — Incorrect. This overestimates the binding and would require either double counting available neighbor sites (e.g., taking $z$ too large) or neglecting the large oxygen-site reservoir normalization, neither of which is consistent with the given crystal structure and site counts.\n\nTherefore, the binding energy is closest to $0.40\\,\\mathrm{eV}$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2813303"}]}
