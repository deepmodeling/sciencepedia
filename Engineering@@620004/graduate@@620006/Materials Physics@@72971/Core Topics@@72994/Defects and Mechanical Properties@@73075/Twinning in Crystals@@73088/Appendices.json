There are no internal contradictions, factual errors, or ambiguities. The problem is a formalizable and non-trivial exercise in applying fundamental principles of crystallography.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict**\nThe problem is deemed **valid**. A solution will be provided.\n\n**Derivation of the Solution**\nThe problem requires the derivation of the twinning shear, denoted by $s$. The problem explicitly defines engineering shear strain, which we apply to the twinning process. The twinning shear $s$ is the ratio of the magnitude of the shear displacement vector to the distance between the crystallographic planes being sheared.\n\nIn the described model, the twin is formed by the glide of successive $\\{111\\}$ planes over one another. The elementary shear event involves the displacement of one $\\{111\\}$ plane relative to its adjacent, parallel $\\{111\\}$ plane. The vector of this displacement is the Burgers vector of the Shockley partial dislocation, $\\mathbf{b}_{\\mathrm{s}}$. The magnitude of this tangential displacement is therefore $|\\mathbf{b}_{\\mathrm{s}}|$.\n\nThe normal separation between these adjacent $\\{111\\}$ planes is the interplanar spacing, $d_{111}$.\n\nAccording to the provided definition, the twinning shear $s$ is given by the expression:\n$$s = \\frac{\\text{tangential displacement}}{\\text{normal separation}} = \\frac{|\\mathbf{b}_{\\mathrm{s}}|}{d_{111}}$$\nThis is the first part of the required derivation.\n\nThe next step is to express $|\\mathbf{b}_{\\mathrm{s}}|$ and $d_{111}$ in terms of the lattice parameter $a$ and then calculate the numerical value of $s$.\n\nFirst, we calculate the magnitude of the Shockley partial Burgers vector, $|\\mathbf{b}_{\\mathrm{s}}|$. The vector is given as $\\mathbf{b}_{\\mathrm{s}} = \\frac{a}{6} \\langle 112 \\rangle$. To find its magnitude, we use the provided formula for the magnitude of a lattice vector, applied to the direction indices $[uvw] = [112]$.\n$$|\\mathbf{b}_{\\mathrm{s}}| = \\left| \\frac{a}{6} [112] \\right| = \\frac{a}{6} \\sqrt{1^2 + 1^2 + 2^2}$$\n$$|\\mathbf{b}_{\\mathrm{s}}| = \\frac{a}{6} \\sqrt{1 + 1 + 4} = \\frac{a}{6} \\sqrt{6}$$\n\nNext, we calculate the interplanar spacing for the $\\{111\\}$ planes, $d_{111}$. Using the provided formula $d_{hkl} = a/\\sqrt{h^{2}+k^{2}+l^{2}}$ with Miller indices $(hkl) = (111)$:\n$$d_{111} = \\frac{a}{\\sqrt{1^2 + 1^2 + 1^2}} = \\frac{a}{\\sqrt{3}}$$\n\nNow, we substitute these two expressions for $|\\mathbf{b}_{\\mathrm{s}}|$ and $d_{111}$ into our equation for the twinning shear $s$.\n$$s = \\frac{|\\mathbf{b}_{\\mathrm{s}}|}{d_{111}} = \\frac{\\frac{a\\sqrt{6}}{6}}{\\frac{a}{\\sqrt{3}}}$$\n\nThe lattice parameter $a$ cancels, as expected for a dimensionless strain value. We are left with a purely numerical expression to simplify.\n$$s = \\frac{a\\sqrt{6}}{6} \\cdot \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{a} = \\frac{\\sqrt{6} \\cdot \\sqrt{3}}{6} = \\frac{\\sqrt{18}}{6}$$\n\nTo obtain the final exact form, we simplify the square root term.\n$$\\sqrt{18} = \\sqrt{9 \\times 2} = 3\\sqrt{2}$$\nSubstituting this back into the expression for $s$:\n$$s = \\frac{3\\sqrt{2}}{6} = \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}$$\n\nThis is the final, exact, dimensionless value for the twinning shear in an FCC crystal under the given idealized model.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}}$$", "id": "2868613"}, {"introduction": "While we often picture twin boundaries as perfectly flat, atomically sharp planes, real interfaces can be more complex.

It is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and all necessary information for a unique solution is provided. We shall proceed with the derivation.\n\nThe problem requires the derivation of the spacing $D$ of a periodic array of disconnections that accommodate a small tilt $\\varepsilon$ of a twin boundary away from the coherent $\\{111\\}$ plane in a face-centered cubic (FCC) crystal. We must begin from first principles as specified.\n\nFirst, we establish the crystallographic and geometric framework. The coherent twin boundary has a unit normal $\\mathbf{n}_{0} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}}(1,1,1)$. The twin operation is a mirror reflection across this plane, represented by the matrix $\\mathbf{S}$. For any vector $\\mathbf{x}$, the reflection is given by $\\mathbf{S}\\mathbf{x} = \\mathbf{x} - 2(\\mathbf{x} \\cdot \\mathbf{n}_{0})\\mathbf{n}_{0}$. The matrix form is thus $\\mathbf{S} = \\mathbf{I} - 2\\mathbf{n}_{0}\\mathbf{n}_{0}^{T}$, where $\\mathbf{I}$ is the identity matrix. Note that for a reflection, $\\mathbf{S} = \\mathbf{S}^{-1}$ and $\\mathbf{S}^{2} = \\mathbf{I}$.\n\nThe actual interface is tilted by a small angle $\\varepsilon \\ll 1$ away from the coherent plane by a rotation about the in-plane axis $\\mathbf{u} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(1,-1,0)$. The unit normal to this tilted interface, $\\mathbf{n}$, is found using linearized small-rotation kinematics:\n$$ \\mathbf{n} \\approx \\mathbf{n}_{0} + \\varepsilon (\\mathbf{u} \\times \\mathbf{n}_{0}) $$\nThis approximation is valid to leading order in $\\varepsilon$.\n\nThe problem states that the interface contains a periodic array of identical disconnections. These are line defects with a combined step and dislocation character. The problem specifies two key characteristics for these defects:\n1.  They have a step height $h$ equal to one $\\{111\\}$ interplanar spacing, $d_{111}$.\n2.  They are \"pure steps\", meaning their Burgers vector component in the coherent plane is zero. This implies the Burgers vector $\\mathbf{b}$ must be parallel to the normal of the coherent plane, $\\mathbf{n}_{0}$.\n\nLet us first determine the Burgers vector $\\mathbf{b}$ associated with such a step. A step of height $h$ on the coherent boundary can be represented by a vector $h\\mathbf{n}_{0}$. According to the topological theory of line defects, the Burgers vector (or closure failure) of a defect is found by applying the transformation law to the vector describing the defect's creation in a reference lattice. The creation of a step of height $h$ perpendicular to the coherent plane is equivalent to introducing a displacement field whose closure failure defines the Burgers vector of the associated twinning dislocation. This closure failure is given by applying the operator $(\\mathbf{I}-\\mathbf{S}^{-1})$ or $(\\mathbf{S}-\\mathbf{I})$ to the step vector. Using the definition of a Burgers circuit closure failure across the defect, the Burgers vector $\\mathbf{b}$ of the disconnection is:\n$$ \\mathbf{b} = (\\mathbf{S} - \\mathbf{I})(h\\mathbf{n}_{0}) $$\nSubstituting $\\mathbf{S} = \\mathbf{I} - 2\\mathbf{n}_{0}\\mathbf{n}_{0}^{T}$, we get:\n$$ \\mathbf{S} - \\mathbf{I} = -2\\mathbf{n}_{0}\\mathbf{n}_{0}^{T} $$\n$$ \\mathbf{b} = (-2\\mathbf{n}_{0}\\mathbf{n}_{0}^{T})(h\\mathbf{n}_{0}) = -2h(\\mathbf{n}_{0} \\cdot \\mathbf{n}_{0})\\mathbf{n}_{0} $$\nSince $\\mathbf{n}_{0}$ is a unit vector, $\\mathbf{n}_{0} \\cdot \\mathbf{n}_{0} = 1$, which gives:\n$$ \\mathbf{b} = -2h\\mathbf{n}_{0} $$\nThe magnitude of the Burgers vector is $|\\mathbf{b}| = 2h$. This result correctly shows that $\\mathbf{b}$ is parallel to $\\mathbf{n}_{0}$, consistent with the \"pure step\" assumption. The step height $h$ is given as the interplanar spacing $d_{111}$. For a cubic crystal with lattice parameter $a$, this is:\n$$ h = d_{111} = \\frac{a}{\\sqrt{1^{2}+1^{2}+1^{2}}} = \\frac{a}{\\sqrt{3}} $$\nTherefore, the magnitude of the Burgers vector for each disconnection is $|\\mathbf{b}| = \\frac{2a}{\\sqrt{3}}$.\n\nNext, we must derive the vector equation relating the defect content to the interface geometry. This is a form of the Frank-Bilby relation. Consider a vector $\\mathbf{P}$ lying within the macroscopic (tilted) interface. The total Burgers vector content $\\mathbf{B}$ of all defects cutting this vector is given by the mismatch of lattice vectors from the two crystals that are mapped onto $\\mathbf{P}$. This relation is:\n$$ \\mathbf{B} = (\\mathbf{I} - \\mathbf{S}^{-1})\\mathbf{P} $$\nSince $\\mathbf{S}^{-1} = \\mathbf{S}$ for a reflection, this becomes:\n$$ \\mathbf{B} = (\\mathbf{I} - \\mathbf{S})\\mathbf{P} $$\nIn our problem, the defects form a periodic array with spacing $D$ along the direction $\\mathbf{v} = \\mathbf{u} \\times \\mathbf{n}$. If we choose the vector $\\mathbf{P}$ to be $\\mathbf{P} = D\\mathbf{v}$, it spans exactly one period and therefore crosses a single disconnection. Thus, the total Burgers vector content is simply $\\mathbf{B} = \\mathbf{b}$. The Frank-Bilby relation for a single period of the interface is:\n$$ \\mathbf{b} = (\\mathbf{I} - \\mathbf{S})(D\\mathbf{v}) $$\nThis is the required vector equation.\n\nNow, we apply this equation to solve for $D$. Substituting $\\mathbf{I} - \\mathbf{S} = 2\\mathbf{n}_{0}\\mathbf{n}_{0}^{T}$:\n$$ \\mathbf{b} = D(2\\mathbf{n}_{0}\\mathbf{n}_{0}^{T})\\mathbf{v} = 2D(\\mathbf{v} \\cdot \\mathbf{n}_{0})\\mathbf{n}_{0} $$\nWe take the magnitude of both sides:\n$$ |\\mathbf{b}| = |2D(\\mathbf{v} \\cdot \\mathbf{n}_{0})\\mathbf{n}_{0}| = 2D|\\mathbf{v} \\cdot \\mathbf{n}_{0}| $$\nWe need to evaluate $|\\mathbf{v} \\cdot \\mathbf{n}_{0}|$. Using the definition $\\mathbf{v} = \\mathbf{u} \\times \\mathbf{n}$ and the vector triple product identity:\n$$ \\mathbf{v} \\cdot \\mathbf{n}_{0} = (\\mathbf{u} \\times \\mathbf{n}) \\cdot \\mathbf{n}_{0} = \\mathbf{u} \\cdot (\\mathbf{n} \\times \\mathbf{n}_{0}) $$\nThe exact expression for $\\mathbf{n}$ is $\\mathbf{n} = \\mathbf{n}_{0}\\cos\\varepsilon + (\\mathbf{u} \\times \\mathbf{n}_{0})\\sin\\varepsilon$. We compute the cross product $\\mathbf{n} \\times \\mathbf{n}_{0}$:\n$$ \\mathbf{n} \\times \\mathbf{n}_{0} = (\\mathbf{n}_{0}\\cos\\varepsilon + (\\mathbf{u} \\times \\mathbf{n}_{0})\\sin\\varepsilon) \\times \\mathbf{n}_{0} = (\\mathbf{n}_{0} \\times \\mathbf{n}_{0})\\cos\\varepsilon + ((\\mathbf{u} \\times \\mathbf{n}_{0}) \\times \\mathbf{n}_{0})\\sin\\varepsilon $$\nUsing $\\mathbf{A} \\times \\mathbf{A} = \\mathbf{0}$ and the vector identity $(\\mathbf{A} \\times \\mathbf{B}) \\times \\mathbf{C} = (\\mathbf{A} \\cdot \\mathbf{C})\\mathbf{B} - (\\mathbf{B} \\cdot \\mathbf{C})\\mathbf{A}$:\n$$ (\\mathbf{u} \\times \\mathbf{n}_{0}) \\times \\mathbf{n}_{0} = (\\mathbf{u} \\cdot \\mathbf{n}_{0})\\mathbf{n}_{0} - (\\mathbf{n}_{0} \\cdot \\mathbf{n}_{0})\\mathbf{u} $$\nSince $\\mathbf{u}$ is in the $\\{111\\}$ plane, $\\mathbf{u} \\cdot \\mathbf{n}_{0} = 0$. Since $\\mathbf{n}_{0}$ is a unit vector, $\\mathbf{n}_{0} \\cdot \\mathbf{n}_{0} = 1$. This simplifies to:\n$$ (\\mathbf{u} \\times \\mathbf{n}_{0}) \\times \\mathbf{n}_{0} = -\\mathbf{u} $$\nTherefore, $\\mathbf{n} \\times \\mathbf{n}_{0} = -\\mathbf{u}\\sin\\varepsilon$. Now substitute this back:\n$$ \\mathbf{v} \\cdot \\mathbf{n}_{0} = \\mathbf{u} \\cdot (-\\mathbf{u}\\sin\\varepsilon) = -(\\mathbf{u} \\cdot \\mathbf{u})\\sin\\varepsilon = -\\sin\\varepsilon $$\nTaking the magnitude, we have $|\\mathbf{v} \\cdot \\mathbf{n}_{0}| = \\sin\\varepsilon$.\nThe magnitude relation becomes:\n$$ |\\mathbf{b}| = 2D\\sin\\varepsilon $$\nFor small angles $\\varepsilon \\ll 1$, $\\sin\\varepsilon \\approx \\varepsilon$.\n$$ |\\mathbf{b}| \\approx 2D\\varepsilon $$\nWe have two expressions for $|\\mathbf{b}|$: $|\\mathbf{b}|=2h$ from the analysis of the step content, and $|\\mathbf{b}| \\approx 2D\\varepsilon$ from the Frank-Bilby analysis of the whole interface.
