Yielding is predicted to occur when the calculated equivalent stress for a given criterion reaches the material's uniaxial yield stress, $\\sigma_{y0}$. If we consider a proportional loading path where all stress components increase by a factor $\\alpha$, yielding occurs when $\\alpha \\sigma_{\\text{eq}} = \\sigma_{y0}$. The criterion with the larger value of $\\sigma_{\\text{eq}}$ for the given stress state will require a smaller scaling factor $\\alpha$ to reach $\\sigma_{y0}$, thus predicting yielding \"earlier\" (i.e., at a lower load level).\nWe have:\n$$\n\\sigma_{\\text{Tresca}} = 500\\,\\text{MPa}\n$$\n$$\n\\sigma_{\\text{VM}} = \\sqrt{201900} \\approx 449.3\\,\\text{MPa}\n$$\nSince $\\sigma_{\\text{Tresca}} > \\sigma_{\\text{VM}}$, the Tresca criterion predicts a higher effective stress for this state. Consequently, the Tresca criterion predicts that yielding will occur before the von Mises criterion does. This is expected, as the Tresca yield surface is always contained within or tangent to the von Mises yield surface in principal stress space, making it a more conservative criterion.\n\nFinally, we compute the dimensionless ratio $r$:\n$$\nr = \\frac{\\sigma_{\\text{VM}}}{\\sigma_{\\text{Tresca}}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{201900}}{500}\n$$\nNumerically evaluating this expression:\n$$\nr = \\frac{449.332838...}{500} \\approx 0.89866567...\n$$\nRounding to four significant figures as required:\n$$\nr \\approx 0.8987\n$$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.8987}$$", "id": "2861644"}, {"introduction": "Predicting the onset of yielding is only the first step; modeling the subsequent plastic flow is a central task in computational mechanics.

No angles are involved.\n\nProgramming tasks:\n- Implement the above logic for each test case.\n- For plastic steps, implement two Newton iterations for $g(\\Delta \\gamma) = 0$ using the two different Jacobians as described, both starting from $\\Delta \\gamma^{(0)} = 0$, and returning the iteration counts upon convergence.\n- For elastic steps, detect that no plastic correction is needed and return zero iterations for both strategies.\n\nTest suite:\nUse the following five test cases. The initial plastic strain is $p_n = 0$ for all cases. For each case, all parameters are given in megapascals where applicable. The material parameter $E$ is kept fixed across the tests at $E = 210000\\ \\mathrm{MPa}$, and the initial yield stress is fixed at $\\sigma_{y0} = 250\\ \\mathrm{MPa}$.\n- Case A (strictly elastic, below yield): $H = 50000$, $\\epsilon_{n+1} = 0.0010$.\n- Case B (perfect plasticity, slight yielding): $H = 0$, $\\epsilon_{n+1} = 0.0013$.\n- Case C (mild hardening, slight yielding): $H = 10000$, $\\epsilon_{n+1} = 0.0013$.\n- Case D (moderate hardening, larger overshoot): $H = 50000$, $\\epsilon_{n+1} = 0.0018$.\n- Case E (boundary case, exactly at yield): $H = 10000$, $\\epsilon_{n+1} = 0.0011904761904761906$.\n\nRequired final output format:\n- Your program should produce a single line containing a list of length $5$, where each entry is a two-element list of the form $[n_{\\mathrm{elastic}}, n_{\\mathrm{consistent}}]$ giving the Newton iteration counts for the elastic tangent strategy and the consistent tangent strategy, respectively, for the corresponding test case in the order A, B, C, D, E.\n- For example, an output might look like: $[[a,b],[c,d],[e,f],[g,h],[i,j]]$ (with integers in place of letters).\n- The program must run without any user input and must print only this single line.", "solution": "The problem statement is evaluated and found to be valid. It presents a clear, self-contained, and scientifically grounded exercise in computational plasticity, a sub-field of materials physics and mechanics. The problem is well-posed, with all necessary parameters and conditions provided to arrive at a unique, meaningful solution. There are no contradictions, ambiguities, or factual inaccuracies. We shall proceed with a formal solution.\n\nThe core of the problem lies in solving for the plastic strain increment $\\Delta\\gamma$ that ensures the stress-strain state satisfies the yield criterion at the end of a prescribed total strain increment. This procedure is known as the return-mapping algorithm. The state at the beginning of the time step, $n$, is characterized by the plastic strain $p_n$. The total strain is prescribed to be $\\epsilon_{n+1}$ at the end of the step.\n\nFirst, an elastic trial step is performed. The trial stress, $\\sigma_{\\mathrm{trial}}$, is computed assuming the entire strain increment is elastic:\n$$ \\sigma_{\\mathrm{trial}} = E (\\epsilon_{n+1} - p_n) $$\nThe yield condition is then checked using this trial stress. The yield stress at the beginning of the step is $\\sigma_{y,n} = \\sigma_{y0} + H p_n$. The trial value of the yield function, $f_{\\mathrm{trial}}$, is:\n$$ f_{\\mathrm{trial}} = \\sigma_{\\mathrm{trial}} - \\sigma_{y,n} = \\sigma_{\\mathrm{trial}} - (\\sigma_{y0} + H p_n) $$\nIf $f_{\\mathrm{trial}} \\le 0$, the assumption of elasticity was correct. The material state remains on or inside the yield surface, and no plastic flow occurs. The final state is simply the trial state, and the number of corrective iterations is zero.\n\nIf $f_{\\mathrm{trial}} > 0$, the trial state is outside the yield surface, which is inadmissible for rate-independent plasticity. A plastic correction is required. A plastic strain increment, $\\Delta\\gamma \\ge 0$, must be found such that the final state lies on the yield surface. The state variables are updated as:\n$$ p_{n+1} = p_n + \\Delta\\gamma $$\n$$ \\sigma_{n+1} = E (\\epsilon_{n+1} - p_{n+1}) = E(\\epsilon_{n+1} - p_n - \\Delta\\gamma) = \\sigma_{\\mathrm{trial}} - E\\Delta\\gamma $$\nThe final state must satisfy the consistency condition, $f(\\sigma_{n+1}, p_{n+1}) = 0$. This provides the scalar residual equation for $\\Delta\\gamma$:\n$$ g(\\Delta\\gamma) = \\sigma_{n+1} - (\\sigma_{y0} + H p_{n+1}) = 0 $$\nSubstituting the expressions for $\\sigma_{n+1}$ and $p_{n+1}$:\n$$ g(\\Delta\\gamma) = (\\sigma_{\\mathrm{trial}} - E\\Delta\\gamma) - (\\sigma_{y0} + H(p_n + \\Delta\\gamma)) $$\nRearranging terms, we obtain a linear equation in $\\Delta\\gamma$:\n$$ g(\\Delta\\gamma) = [\\sigma_{\\mathrm{trial}} - (\\sigma_{y0} + H p_n)] - (E + H)\\Delta\\gamma = f_{\\mathrm{trial}} - (E+H)\\Delta\\gamma = 0 $$\nThis equation is solved using Newton's method, which requires an iterative scheme:\n$$ \\Delta\\gamma^{(k+1)} = \\Delta\\gamma^{(k)} - [J^{(k)}]^{-1} g(\\Delta\\gamma^{(k)}) $$\nwhere $J^{(k)} = \\frac{dg}{d(\\Delta\\gamma)}\\Big|_{\\Delta\\gamma^{(k)}}$ is the Jacobian of the residual. The problem requires a comparison between two choices for this Jacobian.\n\n**Consistent Tangent Strategy**\nThe consistent tangent, or algorithmic tangent, is the exact derivative of the residual function with respect to the unknown. For our linear residual function:\n$$ J_{\\mathrm{cons}} = \\frac{d}{d(\\Delta\\gamma)} \\left[ f_{\\mathrm{trial}} - (E+H)\\Delta\\gamma \\right] = -(E+H) $$\nSince this Jacobian is constant and exact, Newton's method will find the solution in a single step. Starting with the initial guess $\\Delta\\gamma^{(0)} = 0$:\n$$ \\Delta\\gamma^{(1)} = 0 - \\frac{g(0)}{J_{\\mathrm{cons}}} = - \\frac{f_{\\mathrm{trial}}}{-(E+H)} = \\frac{f_{\\mathrm{trial}}}{E+H} $$\nThis is the analytical solution to $g(\\Delta\\gamma)=0$. Thus, for any plastic step, this method converges in exactly one iteration.\n\n**Elastic Tangent Strategy**\nThis strategy employs an approximate Jacobian based on the assumption of a purely elastic material response. In this context, the tangent stiffness is the elastic modulus, $E$. The contribution of plastic hardening to the stiffness is ignored. This amounts to approximating the derivative of the residual by only considering the change in stress with $\\Delta\\gamma$:\n$$ J_{\\mathrm{el}} = \\frac{d}{d(\\Delta\\gamma)} (\\sigma_{\\mathrm{trial}} - E\\Delta\\gamma) = -E $$\nThe update rule is:\n$$ \\Delta\\gamma^{(k+1)} = \\Delta\\gamma^{(k)} - \\frac{g(\\Delta\\gamma^{(k)})}{-E} = \\Delta\\gamma^{(k)} + \\frac{g(\\Delta\\gamma^{(k)})}{E} $$\nWe can analyze the convergence rate by examining the residual at consecutive iterations, $g^{(k)} = g(\\Delta\\gamma^{(k)})$:\n$$ g^{(k+1)} = f_{\\mathrm{trial}} - (E+H)\\Delta\\gamma^{(k+1)} = f_{\\mathrm{trial}} - (E+H)\\left(\\Delta\\gamma^{(k)} + \\frac{g^{(k)}}{E}\\right) $$\n$$ g^{(k+1)} = \\left(f_{\\mathrm{trial}} - (E+H)\\Delta\\gamma^{(k)}\\right) - \\frac{E+H}{E}g^{(k)} = g^{(k)} - \\left(1 + \\frac{H}{E}\\right)g^{(k)} = \\left(-\\frac{H}{E}\\right)g^{(k)} $$\nThe residual is reduced by a constant factor $\\rho = -H/E$ at each step, which is characteristic of linear convergence. The method converges if $|\\rho|<1$. For perfect plasticity ($H=0$), this strategy is identical to the consistent tangent strategy and converges in one iteration. For $H>0$, it converges more slowly than the consistent tangent, with the convergence rate degrading as the ratio $H/E$ increases. The number of iterations, $k$, required to reduce the initial residual $g^{(0)} = f_{\\mathrm{trial}}$ to a tolerance $\\tau$ is found by solving $|g^{(k)}| \\le \\tau$:\n$$ |\\rho|^k |f_{\\mathrm{trial}}| \\le \\tau \\implies k \\ge \\frac{\\ln(\\tau/|f_{\\mathrm{trial}}|)}{\\ln(|\\rho|)} $$\n\nThe implementation will proceed by first evaluating the trial state for each test case. If plastic loading is detected, two separate Newton loops will be executed, one for each Jacobian strategy, starting from $\\Delta\\gamma^{(0)}=0$ and counting the number of updates required to satisfy $|g| \\le 10^{-8}$.", "answer": "```python\n# The complete and runnable Python 3 code goes here.\n# Imports must adhere to the specified execution environment.\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef newton_solve(f_trial, E, H, J_type, tau, N_max):\n    \"\"\"\n    Performs the Newton iteration for the plastic increment.\n    \n    Args:\n        f_trial (float): The initial residual (trial yield function value).\n        E (float): Young's modulus.\n        H (float): Hardening modulus.\n        J_type (str): 'elastic' or 'consistent' for Jacobian choice.\n        tau (float): Convergence tolerance.\n        N_max (int): Maximum number of iterations.\n        \n    Returns:\n        int: Number of iterations performed.\n    \"\"\"\n    if J_type == 'elastic':\n        J = -E\n    elif J_type == 'consistent':\n        # Avoid division by zero for the theoretical case E + H = 0.\n        if abs(E + H) < 1e-15:\n            return N_max\n        J = -(E + H)\n    else:\n        raise ValueError(\"Invalid Jacobian type specified.\")\n\n    n_iterations = 0\n    delta_gamma = 0.0\n    \n    for i in range(N_max):\n        # Calculate residual at the current estimate of delta_gamma\n        g = f_trial - (E + H) * delta_gamma\n        \n        # Check for convergence\n        if abs(g) <= tau:\n            break\n            \n        # Perform Newton update\n        delta_gamma -= g / J\n        n_iterations += 1\n    else:\n        # If loop finishes without break, it did not converge\n        return N_max\n\n    return n_iterations\n\ndef analyze_case(E, sigma_y0, H, eps_np1, p_n=0.0):\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes a single load step for uniaxial elastoplasticity.\n    \n    Args:\n        E (float): Young's modulus [MPa].\n        sigma_y0 (float): Initial yield stress [MPa].\n        H (float): Hardening modulus [MPa].\n        eps_np1 (float): Total strain at step n+1.\n        p_n (float): Plastic strain at step n.\n        \n    Returns:\n        list: A two-element list [n_elastic, n_consistent] of iteration counts.\n    \"\"\"\n    tau = 1.0e-8  # Tolerance [MPa]\n    N_max = 200    # Maximum iterations\n\n    # Step 1: Elastic trial\n    sigma_trial = E * (eps_np1 - p_n)\n    sigma_y_n = sigma_y0 + H * p_n\n    f_trial = sigma_trial - sigma_y_n\n\n    # Step 2: Check for plasticity\n    if f_trial <= tau: # Use tolerance for boundary case\n        return [0, 0]\n\n    # Step 3: Plastic step, perform Newton solves\n    n_elastic = newton_solve(f_trial, E, H, 'elastic', tau, N_max)\n    n_consistent = newton_solve(f_trial, E, H, 'consistent', tau, N_max)\n\n    return [n_elastic, n_consistent]\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Main function to run the test suite and print results.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Material and problem parameters\n    E = 210000.0        # Young's modulus [MPa]\n    sigma_y0 = 250.0    # Initial yield stress [MPa]\n    p_n = 0.0           # Initial plastic strain for all cases\n\n    test_cases = [\n        # Case A (strictly elastic)\n        {'H': 50000.0, 'eps_np1': 0.0010},\n        # Case B (perfect plasticity)\n        {'H': 0.0, 'eps_np1': 0.0013},\n        # Case C (mild hardening)\n        {'H': 10000.0, 'eps_np1': 0.0013},\n        # Case D (moderate hardening)\n        {'H': 50000.0, 'eps_np1': 0.0018},\n        # Case E (boundary case, at yield)\n        {'H': 10000.0, 'eps_np1': 250.0 / 210000.0},\n    ]\n\n    results = []\n    for case in test_cases:\n        H = case['H']\n        eps_np1 = case['eps_np1']\n        iteration_counts = analyze_case(E, sigma_y0, H, eps_np1, p_n)\n        results.append(iteration_counts)\n\n    # Format the output string as specified: [[a,b],[c,d],...]\n    # Using a list comprehension and f-strings to build the string\n    # without extra spaces.\n    formatted_results = ','.join([f\"[{r[0]},{r[1]}]\" for r in results])\n    print(f\"[{formatted_results}]\")\n\nsolve()\n```", "id": "2861610"}]}
