Create $k x$ vacancies on the $A$ sublattice and $k y$ vacancies on the $B$ sublattice for some integer $k>1$; the total effective charge is $-k x z_A + k y z_B = 0$, and this is minimal because increasing $k$ reduces the absolute charge per vacancy.", "solution": "The problem statement will first be subjected to a rigorous validation procedure.\n\n**Step 1: Extraction of Givens**\n\nThe explicit information provided in the problem statement is as follows:\n- Ionic crystal composition: $A_xB_y$.\n- Stoichiometric coefficients: $x,y \\in \\mathbb{Z}_{>0}$ are in the lowest whole-number ratio.\n- Cation: $A$ with formal valence $+z_A$, where $z_A \\in \\mathbb{Z}_{>0}$.\n- Anion: $B$ with formal valence $-z_B$, where $z_B \\in \\mathbb{Z}_{>0}$.\n- Definition of a Schottky disorder event: A simultaneous removal of ions to an external reservoir that (1) creates only vacancies on pre-existing lattice sites, (2) preserves the bulk stoichiometry of the crystal, and (3) leaves no interstitials.\n- Principles to be used:\n    1.  Overall charge neutrality of the perfect crystal.\n    2.  The definition of the effective charge of a vacancy as the negative of the formal charge of the corresponding lattice ion.\n    3.  The requirement that the crystal’s stoichiometry be preserved.\n- The question is to identify the minimal simultaneous set of vacancies that constitutes a full Schottky disorder event in $A_xB_y$ and correctly accounts for its net effective charge.\n\n**Step 2: Validation of Problem Statement**\n\nThe problem is analyzed against the criteria of scientific validity and well-posedness.\n-   **Scientific Grounding**: The problem deals with Schottky defects, a fundamental concept in the physics of crystalline solids. The definitions of stoichiometry, charge neutrality, and effective charge of vacancies are standard and correct within the Kröger-Vink notation framework. The problem is a standard exercise in applying these principles.\n-   **Well-Posedness**: The problem is clearly stated. It provides a set of constraints (charge neutrality, stoichiometry preservation, minimality) and asks for the entity (a set of vacancies) that satisfies them. The term \"minimal\" is unambiguous in this context, referring to the smallest positive integers. A unique solution is derivable from the given principles.\n-   **Objectivity**: The language is precise, formal, and free of any subjective or ambiguous terminology.\n-   **Consistency Check**: A critical relationship must be derived from the givens. The requirement of \"overall charge neutrality of the perfect crystal\" for the compound $A_xB_y$ implies that the sum of all positive and negative charges in a stoichiometric formula unit must be zero. Mathematically, this is expressed as:\n    $$x \\cdot (+z_A) + y \\cdot (-z_B) = 0$$\n    This leads to the fundamental relation:\n    $$x z_A = y z_B$$\n    This relation is a direct consequence of the problem statement and is essential for its solution. The problem is self-contained and internally consistent.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict**\n\nThe problem statement is scientifically sound, well-posed, objective, and self-consistent. It does not violate any of the criteria for invalidity. Therefore, the problem is **valid**, and a solution will be derived.\n\n**Derivation of the Solution**\n\nThe solution is derived from the principles stipulated in the problem statement.\n\n1.  **Stoichiometry Preservation**: The Schottky event must preserve the bulk stoichiometry. The ratio of cations $A$ to anions $B$ in the crystal is $x:y$. To maintain this ratio upon removal of ions, the number of $A$ vacancies created, $N_A$, and the number of $B$ vacancies created, $N_B$, must be in the same ratio:\n    $$\\frac{N_A}{N_B} = \\frac{x}{y}$$\n    Since $x$ and $y$ are given as the lowest whole-number ratio, the *minimal* positive integer solution for $N_A$ and $N_B$ is $N_A = x$ and $N_B = y$. Any other solution would be $N_A = kx$ and $N_B = ky$ for some integer $k > 1$, which would not be minimal. Thus, the minimal set of vacancies required to preserve stoichiometry consists of $x$ vacancies on the $A$ sublattice and $y$ vacancies on the $B$ sublattice.\n\n2.  **Net Effective Charge Calculation**: According to the given definition, the effective charge of a vacancy is the negative of the charge of the ion that normally occupies the site.\n    -   An $A$ vacancy, denoted $V_A$, has an effective charge of $-(+z_A) = -z_A$.\n    -   A $B$ vacancy, denoted $V_B$, has an effective charge of $-(-z_B) = +z_B$.\n    \n    The total effective charge, $Q_{eff}$, of the minimal defect cluster (consisting of $x$ $A$-vacancies and $y$ $B$-vacancies) is the sum of the effective charges of all created vacancies:\n    $$Q_{eff} = x \\cdot (-z_A) + y \\cdot (+z_B) = -x z_A + y z_B$$\n\n3.  **Application of Crystal Charge Neutrality**: From the validation step, we established that the charge neutrality of the perfect $A_xB_y$ crystal requires $x z_A = y z_B$. Substituting this into the expression for $Q_{eff}$:\n    $$Q_{eff} = -x z_A + (x z_A) = 0$$\n    Therefore, the minimal set of vacancies that preserves stoichiometry is also intrinsically charge-neutral with respect to the lattice. The complete Schottky event is the creation of $x$ vacancies $V_A$ and $y$ vacancies $V_B$.\n\n**Evaluation of Options**\n\nEach option is now evaluated against this derived result.\n\n**A. Create $x$ vacancies on the $A$ sublattice and $y$ vacancies on the $B$ sublattice; the total effective charge is $-x z_A + y z_B = 0$, and this is minimal because $x$ and $y$ are the smallest positive integers that preserve the $A:B$ stoichiometry.**\n-   This option correctly identifies that creating $x$ $A$-vacancies and $y$ $B$-vacancies is the minimal set that preserves stoichiometry.\n-   It correctly calculates the total effective charge as $-x z_A + y z_B$.\n-   It correctly concludes that this sum is $0$ by implicitly using the crystal charge neutrality condition $x z_A = y z_B$.\n-   The reasoning for minimality is correct.\n-   **Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. Create $z_B$ vacancies on the $A$ sublattice and $z_A$ vacancies on the $B$ sublattice; the total effective charge is $-z_B z_A + z_A z_B = 0$, and this is minimal for all $x$ and $y$.**\n-   The ratio of vacancies created is $z_B : z_A$. From the crystal neutrality condition $x z_A = y z_B$, we have $x/y = z_B/z_A$. This means creating $z_B$ $A$-vacancies and $z_A$ $B$-vacancies does indeed preserve stoichiometry and, as shown, results in zero net effective charge.\n-   However, the claim of minimality is false. From $x/y = z_B/z_A$ and the fact that $x, y$ are the lowest whole-number ratio, it follows that $z_B = kx$ and $z_A = ky$ for some rational number $k$. More precisely, $x = z_B / \\gcd(z_A, z_B)$ and $y = z_A / \\gcd(z_A, z_B)$. Therefore, the set $(z_B, z_A)$ is $k = \\gcd(z_A, z_B)$ times larger than the minimal set $(x, y)$. If $\\gcd(z_A, z_B) > 1$ (e.g., for MgO where $x=1, y=1, z_A=2, z_B=2$), this set of vacancies is not minimal. The minimal set is $(1,1)$, while this option suggests $(2,2)$. The claim that it is minimal for *all* $x$ and $y$ is incorrect.\n-   **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. Create $1$ vacancy on the $A$ sublattice and $1$ vacancy on the $B$ sublattice; the total effective charge is $-z_A + z_B$, which vanishes for any $A_xB_y$, so this is the universally minimal Schottky event.**\n-   This proposal preserves stoichiometry only if $x:y = 1:1$. It fails for any other stoichiometry, such as $A_2B_3$.\n-   The total effective charge is $-z_A + z_B$. The claim that this \"vanishes for any $A_xB_y$\" is false. It only vanishes if $z_A = z_B$. For a crystal like $\\text{Al}_2\\text{O}_3$, $x=2, y=3, z_A=3, z_B=2$, for which $-z_A + z_B = -3 + 2 = -1 \\neq 0$.\n-   Both central claims of this option are fundamentally flawed.\n-   **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. Create $kx$ vacancies on the $A$ sublattice and $ky$ vacancies on the $B$ sublattice for some integer $k>1$; the total effective charge is $-k x z_A + k y z_B = 0$, and this is minimal because increasing $k$ reduces the absolute charge per vacancy.**\n-   This set of vacancies preserves stoichiometry and has a net effective charge of $0$. However, the problem asks for the *minimal* set. By explicitly stating $k > 1$, this option describes a non-minimal set of vacancies. A smaller valid set exists for $k=1$.\n-   The reasoning provided, \"because increasing $k$ reduces the absolute charge per vacancy,\" is nonsensical. The charge per vacancy is an intrinsic property ($-z_A$ or $+z_B$) and does not depend on $k$.\n-   **Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2856843"}, {"introduction": "The existence of defects in a crystal is a classic example of thermodynamics at work, where the energetic cost of creating disorder is balanced by an increase in entropy.

The physical concepts—Schottky and Frenkel defects, configurational entropy, Helmholtz free energy, and thermally activated ionic conductivity—are cornerstones of materials physics. The rock-salt structure and the given number of interstitial sites ($N_{\\text{i}} = 2N$) are consistent with crystallographic facts for this structure. The assumptions (low concentration, negligible interactions, dominance of a single carrier type, equality of kinetic parameters) are standard idealizations used to construct a tractable model and isolate a specific physical effect, in this case, the role of configurational entropy. The problem is self-contained, scientifically grounded, and well-posed. It requires a derivation from first principles, which is a valid scientific task.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem statement is valid. A full solution will be derived.\n\n### Derivation\nThe equilibrium concentration of defects is found by minimizing the Helmholtz free energy $F = U - TS$ with respect to the number of defects. The change in free energy upon creating $n$ defect pairs is $\\Delta F(n) = \\Delta U(n) - T \\Delta S(n)$.\n\nThe change in internal energy is $\\Delta U(n) = n\\Delta H$, where $\\Delta H$ is the formation enthalpy per pair.\nThe change in entropy is assumed to be purely configurational, $\\Delta S(n) = S_{\\text{config}}(n) = k_B \\ln W(n)$, where $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant and $W(n)$ is the number of ways to arrange $n$ defects.\nThus, the free energy to be minimized is $F(n) = n\\Delta H - T k_B \\ln W(n)$. Equilibrium is at $\\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial n} = 0$.\n\n**1. Sample S (Schottky Disorder)**\nA Schottky pair consists of one cation vacancy and one anion vacancy. To create $n_{\\text{S}}$ pairs, we create $n_{\\text{S}}$ cation vacancies on $N$ cation sites and $n_{\\text{S}}$ anion vacancies on $N$ anion sites. The number of microstates is:\n$$W_{\\text{S}}(n_{\\text{S}}) = \\binom{N}{n_{\\text{S}}} \\binom{N}{n_{\\text{S}}} = \\left(\\frac{N!}{n_{\\text{S}}!(N-n_{\\text{S}})!}\\right)^2$$\nThe configurational entropy is $S_{\\text{config,S}} = k_B \\ln W_{\\text{S}}$.

Ionic Conductivity and Pre-exponential Factors**\nIonic conductivity, $\\sigma$, is proportional to the concentration of mobile charge carriers, $c_{\\text{carrier}}$, and their mobility, $\\mu$: $\\sigma = c_{\\text{carrier}} |q| \\mu$. The carrier concentration is proportional to the number of defects: $c \\propto n$. The mobility for thermally activated hopping follows an Arrhenius law, $\\mu \\propto T^{-1}\\exp(-E_m/k_B T)$, where $E_m$ is the migration energy.\nThus, the conductivity has the general form:\n$$\\sigma(T) \\propto n(T) \\cdot T^{-1} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_m}{k_B T}\\right)$$\nThe overall expression follows an Arrhenius law $\\sigma(T) = A_{\\sigma} \\exp(-E_A/k_B T)$, where $A_{\\sigma}$ is the pre-exponential factor and $E_A$ is the total activation energy.\n\nFor sample $\\text{S}$, the carriers are cation vacancies ($n_{\\text{S}}$ of them):\n$$\\sigma_{\\text{S}}(T) \\propto n_{\\text{S}}(T) T^{-1} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_{m,v}}{k_B T}\\right) \\propto N \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta H_{\\text{S}}}{2k_B T}\\right) T^{-1} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_{m,v}}{k_B T}\\right)$$\n$$\\sigma_{\\text{S}}(T) = C_0 T^{-1} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta H_{\\text{S}}/2 + E_{m,v}}{k_B T}\\right)$$\nHere, $C_0$ is a constant incorporating $N$ and the kinetic factors ($q, a, \\nu, f$). The pre-exponential factor is $A_{\\sigma,\\text{S}} \\approx C_0 T^{-1}$.\n\nFor sample $\\text{F}$, the carriers are cation interstitials ($n_{\\text{F}}$ of them):\n$$\\sigma_{\\text{F}}(T) \\propto n_{\\text{F}}(T) T^{-1} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_{m,i}}{k_B T}\\right) \\propto \\sqrt{2} N \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta H_{\\text{F}}}{2k_B T}\\right) T^{-1} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_{m,i}}{k_B T}\\right)$$\n$$\\sigma_{\\text{F}}(T) = C_0 \\sqrt{2} T^{-1} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta H_{\\text{F}}/2 + E_{m,i}}{k_B T}\\right)$$\nThe constant $C_0$ is the same because the problem states that $q, a, \\nu, f$ are equal for both samples, implying the mobility prefactors are the same. It is also assumed that the migration energies are equal, $E_{m,v} = E_{m,i} = E_m$.\n\nWe are given the special case $\\Delta H_{\\text{S}} = \\Delta H_{\\text{F}} = \\Delta H$. In this situation, the total activation energies are identical: $E_{A,\\text{S}} = E_{A,\\text{F}} = \\Delta H/2 + E_m$.\nThe expressions for conductivity simplify to:\n$$\\sigma_{\\text{S}}(T) = A_{\\sigma,\\text{S}} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_A}{k_B T}\\right) \\quad \\text{with} \\quad A_{\\sigma,\\text{S}} = C_0 T^{-1}$$\n$$\\sigma_{\\text{F}}(T) = A_{\\sigma,\\text{F}} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_A}{k_B T}\\right) \\quad \\text{with} \\quad A_{\\sigma,\\text{F}} = \\sqrt{2} C_0 T^{-1}$$\nThe ratio of the pre-exponential factors is:\n$$\\frac{A_{\\sigma,\\text{F}}}{A_{\\sigma,\\text{S}}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{2} C_0 T^{-1}}{C_0 T^{-1}} = \\sqrt{2}$$\nThe origin of this factor $\\sqrt{2}$ is the ratio of pre-exponential factors in the equilibrium defect concentrations $n_{\\text{F}}/n_{\\text{S}}$, which traces back to the combinatorial term $\\sqrt{N N_{\\text{i}}}/\\sqrt{N N} = \\sqrt{N_i/N} = \\sqrt{2N/N} = \\sqrt{2}$. This difference arises because there are $2N$ interstitial sites available for Frenkel defects versus only $N$ anion sites available for Schottky defects, leading to a higher configurational entropy for Frenkel disorder.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. $A_{\\sigma,\\text{F}}/A_{\\sigma,\\text{S}} = \\sqrt{2}$, because the number of ways to place a Frenkel pair scales as $\\binom{N}{n}\\binom{2N}{n}$ while that for a Schottky pair scales as $\\binom{N}{n}\\binom{N}{n}$, yielding a larger configurational degeneracy (and thus entropy) for Frenkel disorder.**\n- The calculated ratio is $A_{\\sigma,\\text{F}}/A_{\\sigma,\\text{S}} = \\sqrt{2}$, which is correct.\n- The reasoning provided is entirely consistent with the derivation. The number of microstates for Frenkel disorder, $W_{\\text{F}}(n) = \\binom{N}{n}\\binom{2N}{n}$, is indeed larger than that for Schottky disorder, $W_{\\text{S}}(n) = \\binom{N}{n}\\binom{N}{n}$. This leads to a larger configurational entropy for Frenkel disorder, which in turn results in a higher equilibrium defect concentration and, consequently, a larger conductivity pre-exponential factor by a factor of $\\sqrt{2}$.\n- **Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. $A_{\\sigma,\\text{F}}/A_{\\sigma,\\text{S}} = 1$, because the preexponential factor depends only on kinetic prefactors ($q$, $a$, $\\nu$, $f$), which are assumed equal.**\n- The calculated ratio is not $1$.\n- The reasoning is flawed. The conductivity pre-exponential factor, $A_{\\sigma}$, is a product of terms from the mobility pre-factor and the defect concentration pre-factor. While the kinetic factors determining mobility are assumed equal, the thermodynamic factors determining the defect concentration are not. The difference in configurational entropy leads to different pre-factors for $n_{\\text{S}}$ and $n_{\\text{F}}$. This option ignores the contribution from defect thermodynamics.\n- **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. $A_{\\sigma,\\text{F}}/A_{\\sigma,\\text{S}} = 2$, because Frenkel defects add $2$ defect species (vacancy and interstitial) while Schottky adds only $1$.**\n- The calculated ratio is not $2$.\n- The reasoning is factually incorrect. A Schottky pair also consists of two defects: a cation vacancy and an anion vacancy. The argument is based on a false premise. Both defect types involve pairs of point defects.\n- **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. $A_{\\sigma,\\text{F}}/A_{\\sigma,\\text{S}} = \\sqrt{2}\\, N$, because pairing introduces an extra factor of $n!$ in the microstate count that enhances the Frenkel degeneracy by an extensive factor.**\n- The calculated ratio is not $\\sqrt{2} N$. Such a result would imply the ratio of two intensive properties (conductivity) is extensive, which is physically implausible.\n- The reasoning is incorrect. The combinatorial formulas correctly account for the indistinguishability of defects by dividing by $n!$ terms, not by adding extra ones. The derivation shows that the factor $N$ appears in both $n_{\\text{S}}$ and $n_{\\text{F}}$ expressions, but does not appear as a multiplier in their ratio.\n- **Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2856820"}, {"introduction": "In real materials, point defects are not always isolated; oppositely charged defects can attract each other to form neutral pairs.

In Kröger–Vink notation, the relevant point defects are a singly negatively charged sodium vacancy $V_{\\text{Na}}^{'}$ and a singly positively charged chlorine vacancy $V_{\\text{Cl}}^{\\cdot}$. In addition to independent, noninteracting point defects, assume that these two vacancies can reversibly associate to form a neutral nearest-neighbor pair $[V_{\\text{Na}}^{'}V_{\\text{Cl}}^{\\cdot}]$ that is immobile on the timescale of electrical transport. Work in the dilute limit and assume ideal activities.\n\nLet $X_{V,\\text{Na}}$ and $X_{V,\\text{Cl}}$ denote the site fractions of free vacancies on the sodium and chlorine sublattices, respectively, and let $X_{\\text{assoc}}$ denote the site fraction of associated neutral pairs. Charge neutrality implies $X_{V,\\text{Na}}=X_{V,\\text{Cl}}$. Define the intrinsic Schottky equilibrium constant $K_{\\text{S}}(T)$ with respect to site fractions as the mass-action constant for the overall creation of one sodium-vacancy site and one chlorine-vacancy site from the perfect lattice, so that, under ideality, $K_{\\text{S}}(T)=X_{V,\\text{Na}}^{\\text{(tot)}} X_{V,\\text{Cl}}^{\\text{(tot)}}$, where $X_{V,\\text{Na}}^{\\text{(tot)}}=X_{V,\\text{Na}}+X_{\\text{assoc}}$ and $X_{V,\\text{Cl}}^{\\text{(tot)}}=X_{V,\\text{Cl}}+X_{\\text{assoc}}$.

The concepts of Schottky defects, defect association, mass-action laws, and their relation to ionic conductivity are fundamental to materials physics. All terms are precisely defined, and the assumptions (dilute limit, ideal activities) are standard for such theoretical treatments. The problem is scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and internally consistent. It does not violate any of the invalidity criteria.\n\nStep 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is deemed valid. A rigorous derivation will be provided.\n\nThe objective is to derive an expression for the apparent equilibrium constant, $K_{\\text{app}}(T)$, in terms of the true intrinsic Schottky constant, $K_{\\text{S}}(T)$, and the association constant, $K_{\\text{a}}(T)$. We begin with the provided definitions and relationships.\n\nThe apparent equilibrium constant, which is what would be inferred from conductivity measurements assuming no defect association, is given by:\n$$K_{\\text{app}}(T) = X_{V,\\text{free}}^{2}$$\nwhere $X_{V,\\text{free}}$ is the site fraction of free vacancies. The charge neutrality condition for an intrinsic material requires that the concentration of free, oppositely charged vacancies be equal:\n$$X_{V,\\text{Na}} = X_{V,\\text{Cl}} \\equiv X_{V,\\text{free}}$$\nFrom this, it follows that $X_{V,\\text{free}} = \\sqrt{K_{\\text{app}}(T)}$. We will assume $K_{\\text{app}}(T) > 0$.\n\nThe association of a sodium vacancy and a chlorine vacancy to form a neutral pair is described by the quasiequilibrium reaction $V_{\\text{Na}}^{'}+V_{\\text{Cl}}^{\\cdot}\\rightleftharpoons [V_{\\text{Na}}^{'}V_{\\text{Cl}}^{\\cdot}]$. The corresponding association constant is:\n$$K_{\\text{a}}(T) = \\frac{X_{\\text{assoc}}}{X_{V,\\text{Na}}X_{V,\\text{Cl}}}$$\nSubstituting $X_{V,\\text{Na}} = X_{V,\\text{Cl}} = X_{V,\\text{free}}$, we obtain:\n$$K_{\\text{a}}(T) = \\frac{X_{\\text{assoc}}}{X_{V,\\text{free}}^{2}} = \\frac{X_{\\text{assoc}}}{K_{\\text{app}}(T)}$$\nThis allows us to express the site fraction of associated pairs, $X_{\\text{assoc}}$, in terms of $K_{\\text{a}}(T)$ and $K_{\\text{app}}(T)$:\n$$X_{\\text{assoc}} = K_{\\text{a}}(T) K_{\\text{app}}(T)$$\n\nThe true intrinsic Schottky equilibrium constant, $K_{\\text{S}}(T)$, is defined based on the total vacancy concentrations, which include both free and associated defects:\n$$K_{\\text{S}}(T) = X_{V,\\text{Na}}^{\\text{(tot)}} X_{V,\\text{Cl}}^{\\text{(tot)}}$$\nThe total site fractions are given by the sum of free and associated fractions:\n$$X_{V,\\text{Na}}^{\\text{(tot)}} = X_{V,\\text{Na}} + X_{\\text{assoc}} = X_{V,\\text{free}} + X_{\\text{assoc}}$$\n$$X_{V,\\text{Cl}}^{\\text{(tot)}} = X_{V,\\text{Cl}} + X_{\\text{assoc}} = X_{V,\\text{free}} + X_{\\text{assoc}}$$\nTherefore, the total site fractions for the two sublattices are equal: $X_{V,\\text{Na}}^{\\text{(tot)}} = X_{V,\\text{Cl}}^{\\text{(tot)}}$. The expression for $K_{\\text{S}}(T)$ simplifies to:\n$$K_{\\text{S}}(T) = (X_{V,\\text{free}} + X_{\\text{assoc}})^2$$\n\nTaking the square root of both sides, and noting that site fractions are non-negative, yields:\n$$\\sqrt{K_{\\text{S}}(T)} = X_{V,\\text{free}} + X_{\\text{assoc}}$$\n\nNow, we substitute the expressions for $X_{V,\\text{free}}$ and $X_{\\text{assoc}}$ in terms of $K_{\\text{app}}(T)$ and $K_{\\text{a}}(T)$:\n$$X_{V,\\text{free}} = \\sqrt{K_{\\text{app}}(T)}$$\n$$X_{\\text{assoc}} = K_{\\text{a}}(T) K_{\\text{app}}(T)$$\nThe equation for $\\sqrt{K_{\\text{S}}(T)}$ becomes a relationship between the three equilibrium constants:\n$$\\sqrt{K_{\\text{S}}(T)} = \\sqrt{K_{\\text{app}}(T)} + K_{\\text{a}}(T) K_{\\text{app}}(T)$$\n\nTo find a closed-form expression for $K_{\\text{app}}(T)$, we must solve this equation. Let $y = \\sqrt{K_{\\text{app}}(T)}$. The equation is quadratic in $y$:\n$$K_{\\text{a}}(T) y^2 + y - \\sqrt{K_{\\text{S}}(T)} = 0$$\nWe solve for $y$ using the quadratic formula, $y = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$, with $a = K_{\\text{a}}(T)$, $b = 1$, and $c = -\\sqrt{K_{\\text{S}}(T)}$:\n$$y = \\frac{-1 \\pm \\sqrt{1^2 - 4(K_{\\text{a}}(T))(-\\sqrt{K_{\\text{S}}(T)})}}{2K_{\\text{a}}(T)}$$\n$$y = \\frac{-1 \\pm \\sqrt{1 + 4K_{\\text{a}}(T)\\sqrt{K_{\\text{S}}(T)}}}{2K_{\\text{a}}(T)}$$\nSince $y = \\sqrt{K_{\\text{app}}(T)}$, it must be a real and positive quantity. The equilibrium constants $K_{\\text{a}}(T)$ and $K_{\\text{S}}(T)$ are inherently non-negative, so the term under the square root, $1 + 4K_{\\text{a}}(T)\\sqrt{K_{\\text{S}}(T)}$, is always greater than or equal to $1$. To ensure that $y$ is positive, we must select the positive root in the numerator.\n$$y = \\sqrt{K_{\\text{app}}(T)} = \\frac{-1 + \\sqrt{1 + 4K_{\\text{a}}(T)\\sqrt{K_{\\text{S}}(T)}}}{2K_{\\text{a}}(T)}$$\n\nFinally, we square this expression to obtain the apparent equilibrium constant, $K_{\\text{app}}(T)$:\n$$K_{\\text{app}}(T) = \\left( \\frac{\\sqrt{1 + 4K_{\\text{a}}(T)\\sqrt{K_{\\text{S}}(T)}} - 1}{2K_{\\text{a}}(T)} \\right)^2$$\nThis is the required closed-form expression for $K_{\\text{app}}(T)$ in terms of $K_{\\text{S}}(T)$ and $K_{\\text{a}}(T)$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\left( \\frac{\\sqrt{1 + 4 K_a(T) \\sqrt{K_S(T)}} - 1}{2 K_a(T)} \\right)^2}$$", "id": "2856846"}]}
