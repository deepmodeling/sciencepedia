A critical detail is that the problem asks for $x_F(T)$ as a function of $T$, $N_c$, $N_i$, and $\\Delta G_F$, and for $x_S(T)$ as a function of $T$, $N_c$, $N_a$, and $\\Delta G_S$.

In a solid, the $P\\Delta V$ term is negligible, so $\\Delta G_F \\approx \\Delta U_F - T \\Delta S_{vib, F}$, where $\\Delta S_{vib, F}$ is the change in vibrational entropy per pair. The total free energy change is thus the sum of the formation free energies for $n_F$ pairs minus the contribution from the configurational entropy, $S_{config, F}$.\n$$F_F(n_F) = n_F \\Delta G_F - T S_{config,F}$$\nThe configurational entropy $S_{config, F}$ arises from the number of ways, $W_F$, to arrange the defects:\n$$S_{config, F} = k_B \\ln W_F$$\nThere are $n_F$ cation vacancies to be placed on $N_c$ cation sites, and $n_F$ cation interstitials to be placed on $N_i$ interstitial sites.

It is a standard problem in the thermodynamics of materials. We may proceed with the solution.\n\nThe problem is addressed in three parts: the derivation of the formation enthalpy's pressure dependence, the derivation of the defect concentration ratio, and a numerical evaluation.\n\nFirst, we derive the linear relationship for the formation enthalpy, $H_f(P)$. The formation enthalpy, $H_f$, is defined as the change in the total enthalpy, $H$, of the crystal upon the creation of a single defect at constant temperature $T$ and pressure $P$. Formally, this is the partial derivative with respect to the number of defects, $N_{def}$:\n$$H_f \\equiv \\left(\\frac{\\partial H}{\\partial N_{def}}\\right)_{T,P}$$\nTo find how $H_f$ changes with pressure, we examine its partial derivative $(\\partial H_f / \\partial P)_T$. By commuting the order of differentiation:\n$$\\left(\\frac{\\partial H_f}{\\partial P}\\right)_T = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial P}\\left[\\left(\\frac{\\partial H}{\\partial N_{def}}\\right)_{T,P}\\right]_T = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial N_{def}}\\left[\\left(\\frac{\\partial H}{\\partial P}\\right)_T\\right]_{T,P}$$\nFrom the fundamental thermodynamic relation $dH = T\\,dS + V\\,dP$, we can write the partial derivative of enthalpy with respect to pressure at constant temperature as:\n$$\\left(\\frac{\\partial H}{\\partial P}\\right)_T = T\\left(\\frac{\\partial S}{\\partial P}\\right)_T + V$$\nUsing the Maxwell relation that stems from the Gibbs free energy differential $dG = -S\\,dT + V\\,dP$, which is $(\\partial S / \\partial P)_T = -(\\partial V / \\partial T)_P$, we substitute this into the expression for $(\\partial H / \\partial P)_T$:\n$$\\left(\\frac{\\partial H}{\\partial P}\\right)_T = V - T\\left(\\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial T}\\right)_P$$\nNow, we substitute this back into our expression for the pressure derivative of the formation enthalpy:\n$$\\left(\\frac{\\partial H_f}{\\partial P}\\right)_T = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial N_{def}}\\left[V - T\\left(\\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial T}\\right)_P\\right]_{T,P} = \\left(\\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial N_{def}}\\right)_{T,P} - T \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial N_{def}}\\left[\\left(\\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial T}\\right)_P\\right]_{T,P}$$\nWe define the formation volume, $V_f$, as the change in the crystal's volume upon creation of one defect at constant $T$ and $P$:\n$$V_f \\equiv \\left(\\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial N_{def}}\\right)_{T,P}$$\nCommuting the derivatives in the second term gives:\n$$\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial N_{def}}\\left[\\left(\\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial T}\\right)_P\\right]_{T,P} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial T}\\left[\\left(\\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial N_{def}}\\right)_{T,P}\\right]_P = \\left(\\frac{\\partial V_f}{\\partial T}\\right)_P$$\nThus, we arrive at the exact thermodynamic relation:\n$$\\left(\\frac{\\partial H_f}{\\partial P}\\right)_T = V_f - T\\left(\\frac{\\partial V_f}{\\partial T}\\right)_P$$\nTo obtain a linear relationship for $H_f(P)$, we integrate this expression from a reference pressure of $0$ to a final pressure $P$. To do this, we must make an assumption, as specified in the problem: for a small pressure range, the right-hand side of the equation can be treated as a constant with respect to pressure. This requires that both $V_f$ and its temperature derivative $(\\partial V_f / \\partial T)_P$ are independent of pressure. Under this assumption, the integration is straightforward:\n$$H_f(P) - H_f(0) = \\int_0^P \\left[V_f - T\\left(\\frac{\\partial V_f}{\\partial T}\\right)_P\\right] dP' = \\left[V_f - T\\left(\\frac{\\partial V_f}{\\partial T}\\right)_P\\right] P$$\nThe resulting linear-in-pressure relation for the formation enthalpy is:\n$$H_f(P) = H_f(0) + \\left[V_f - T\\left(\\frac{\\partial V_f}{\\partial T}\\right)_P\\right] P$$\n\nSecond, we derive the expression for the ratio of equilibrium defect concentrations, $c(P)/c(0)$. The problem states that the concentration $c$ is proportional to the Boltzmann factor involving the formation Gibbs free energy, $G_f$:\n$$c(P) = A \\exp\\left(-\\frac{G_f(P)}{k_B T}\\right)$$\nwhere $A$ is a proportionality constant. The ratio of the concentration at pressure $P$ to that at zero pressure is:\n$$\\frac{c(P)}{c(0)} = \\frac{A \\exp\\left(-G_f(P) / (k_B T)\\right)}{A \\exp\\left(-G_f(0) / (k_B T)\\right)} = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{G_f(P) - G_f(0)}{k_B T}\\right)$$\nTo evaluate the change $G_f(P) - G_f(0)$, we use its relationship with the formation volume $V_f$. From the differential of Gibbs free energy, $dG = -S\\,dT + V\\,dP$, we have $(\\partial G / \\partial P)_T = V$. Applying this to the formation Gibbs free energy $G_f = (\\partial G / \\partial N_{def})_{T,P}$:\n$$\\left(\\frac{\\partial G_f}{\\partial P}\\right)_T = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial P}\\left[\\left(\\frac{\\partial G}{\\partial N_{def}}\\right)_{T,P}\\right]_T = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial N_{def}}\\left[\\left(\\frac{\\partial G}{\\partial P}\\right)_T\\right]_{T,P} = \\left(\\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial N_{def}}\\right)_{T,P} = V_f$$\nIntegrating this from pressure $0$ to $P$, under the assumption that $V_f$ is independent of pressure:\n$$G_f(P) - G_f(0) = \\int_0^P V_f dP' = V_f P$$\nSubstituting this into the concentration ratio expression, we obtain:\n$$\\frac{c(P)}{c(0)} = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{P V_f}{k_B T}\\right)$$\nWe now explain why a negative formation volume ($V_f < 0$) causes the concentration to increase under compression ($P > 0$). In the expression for the ratio, the argument of the exponential is $-P V_f / (k_B T)$. Given $P>0$, $T>0$, and $k_B>0$, if $V_f<0$, the product $P V_f$ is negative. Therefore, the entire argument $-P V_f / (k_B T)$ is positive. Since $\\exp(x) > 1$ for any $x > 0$, it follows that $c(P)/c(0) > 1$, which means $c(P) > c(0)$. This is consistent with Le Chatelier's principle: applying pressure favors the thermodynamic state with a smaller volume. If creating a defect reduces the crystal's volume, the system will respond to applied pressure by creating more defects to lower its total Gibbs free energy.\n\nThird, we perform the numerical evaluation.

The problem states that the combined multiplicity of the perpendicular families ($x$ and $y$) is $g_{\\perp} = 2$, and the population splits equally between them. This means the concentration of $x$-aligned interstitials is proportional to a multiplicity of $g_{x} = 1$.\n$$C_{x} \\propto 1 \\cdot \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_{f,0} - \\sigma \\Omega_{\\perp}}{k_{B} T}\\right)$$\nThe ratio of concentrations is then:\n$$\\frac{C_{\\parallel}}{C_{x}} = \\frac{\\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_{f,0} - \\sigma \\Omega_{\\parallel}}{k_{B} T}\\right)}{\\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_{f,0} - \\sigma \\Omega_{\\perp}}{k_{B} T}\\right)} = \\exp\\left(\\frac{-(E_{f,0} - \\sigma \\Omega_{\\parallel}) + (E_{f,0} - \\sigma \\Omega_{\\perp})}{k_{B} T}\\right)$$\n$$\\frac{C_{\\parallel}}{C_{x}} = \\exp\\left(\\frac{\\sigma (\\Omega_{\\parallel} - \\Omega_{\\perp})}{k_{B} T}\\right) = \\exp\\left(\\frac{\\sigma \\Delta \\Omega}{k_{B} T}\\right)$$\nwhere $\\Delta \\Omega \\equiv \\Omega_{\\parallel} - \\Omega_{\\perp}$.\n\nNext, we analyze the jump rates. According to Transition State Theory, the jump rate $\\Gamma_{i}$ for an interstitial in family $i$ is proportional to the exponential of its migration energy barrier $E_{m,i}$.\n$$\\Gamma_{i} \\propto \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_{m,i}(\\sigma)}{k_{B} T}\\right)$$\nThe jump rate for the parallel family is:\n$$\\Gamma_{\\parallel} \\propto \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_{m,\\parallel}(\\sigma)}{k_{B} T}\\right) = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_{m,0} - \\sigma V^{\\ast}_{\\parallel}}{k_{B} T}\\right)$$\nThe jump rate for the $x$-aligned interstitial (a member of the perpendicular family) is:\n$$\\Gamma_{x} \\propto \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_{m,\\perp}(\\sigma)}{k_{B} T}\\right) = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_{m,0} - \\sigma V^{\\ast}_{\\perp}}{k_{B} T}\\right)$$\nThe ratio of jump rates is:\n$$\\frac{\\Gamma_{\\parallel}}{\\Gamma_{x}} = \\frac{\\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_{m,0} - \\sigma V^{\\ast}_{\\parallel}}{k_{B} T}\\right)}{\\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_{m,0} - \\sigma V^{\\ast}_{\\perp}}{k_{B} T}\\right)} = \\exp\\left(\\frac{-(E_{m,0} - \\sigma V^{\\ast}_{\\parallel}) + (E_{m,0} - \\sigma V^{\\ast}_{\\perp})}{k_{B} T}\\right)$$\n$$\\frac{\\Gamma_{\\parallel}}{\\Gamma_{x}} = \\exp\\left(\\frac{\\sigma (V^{\\ast}_{\\parallel} - V^{\\ast}_{\\perp})}{k_{B} T}\\right) = \\exp\\left(\\frac{\\sigma \\Delta V^{\\ast}}{k_{B} T}\\right)$$\nwhere $\\Delta V^{\\ast} \\equiv V^{\\ast}_{\\parallel} - V^{\\ast}_{\\perp}$.\n\nCombining the ratios of concentration and jump rate gives the final expression for the ratio of diffusivities:\n$$\\frac{D_{z}}{D_{x}} = \\left(\\frac{C_{\\parallel}}{C_{x}}\\right) \\left(\\frac{\\Gamma_{\\parallel}}{\\Gamma_{x}}\\right) = \\exp\\left(\\frac{\\sigma \\Delta \\Omega}{k_{B} T}\\right) \\exp\\left(\\frac{\\sigma \\Delta V^{\\ast}}{k_{B} T}\\right)$$\n$$\\frac{D_{z}}{D_{x}} = \\exp\\left(\\frac{\\sigma (\\Delta \\Omega + \\Delta V^{\\ast})}{k_{B} T}\\right)$$\n\nNow, we evaluate this expression numerically using the provided data:\n- $\\sigma = 1.00 \\times 10^{9} \\ \\mathrm{Pa}$\n- $T = 800 \\ \\mathrm{K}$\n- $\\Omega_{\\mathrm{atom}} = 1.20 \\times 10^{-29} \\ \\mathrm{m}^{3}$\n- $\\Delta \\Omega = 0.30 \\, \\Omega_{\\mathrm{atom}} = 0.30 \\times (1.20 \\times 10^{-29}) \\ \\mathrm{m}^{3} = 3.6 \\times 10^{-30} \\ \\mathrm{m}^{3}$\n- $\\Delta V^{\\ast} = 0.10 \\, \\Omega_{\\mathrm{atom}} = 0.10 \\times (1.20 \\times 10^{-29}) \\ \\mathrm{m}^{3} = 1.2 \\times 10^{-30} \\ \\mathrm{m}^{3}$\n- $k_{B} \\approx 1.380649 \\times 10^{-23} \\ \\mathrm{J} \\cdot \\mathrm{K}^{-1}$\n\nThe sum of the volume anisotropies is:\n$$\\Delta \\Omega + \\Delta V^{\\ast} = (3.6 + 1.2) \\times 10^{-30} \\ \\mathrm{m}^{3} = 4.8 \\times 10^{-30} \\ \\mathrm{m}^{3}$$\n\nThe argument of the exponential function is a dimensionless quantity:\n$$\\frac{\\sigma (\\Delta \\Omega + \\Delta V^{\\ast})}{k_{B} T} = \\frac{(1.00 \\times 10^{9} \\ \\mathrm{Pa}) \\times (4.8 \\times 10^{-30} \\ \\mathrm{m}^{3})}{(1.380649 \\times 10^{-23} \\ \\mathrm{J} \\cdot \\mathrm{K}^{-1}) \\times (800 \\ \\mathrm{K})}$$\n$$\\frac{\\sigma (\\Delta \\Omega + \\Delta V^{\\ast})}{k_{B} T} = \\frac{4.8 \\times 10^{-21} \\ \\mathrm{J}}{1.1045192 \\times 10^{-20} \\ \\mathrm{J}} \\approx 0.434600$$\n\nFinally, the ratio of diffusivities is:\n$$\\frac{D_{z}}{D_{x}} = \\exp(0.434600) \\approx 1.54434$$\nRounding to four significant figures, the result is $1.544$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{1.544}$$", "id": "2852116"}]}
