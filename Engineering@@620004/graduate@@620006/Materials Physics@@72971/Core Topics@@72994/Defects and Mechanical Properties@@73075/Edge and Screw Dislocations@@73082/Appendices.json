It is scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and internally consistent. All necessary data and conditions for a unique solution are provided. Therefore, the problem is deemed valid and a solution will be provided.\n\nThe fundamental principle for calculating the mechanical force per unit length, $\\mathbf{F}$, on a dislocation line is the Peach-Koehler formula. This formula is a direct consequence of the principles of linear elasticity and is the definition of the mechanical force requested in the problem statement. The formula is:\n$$ \\mathbf{F} = (\\boldsymbol{\\sigma} \\cdot \\mathbf{b}) \\times \\mathbf{t} $$\nwhere $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}$ is the externally applied Cauchy stress tensor, $\\mathbf{b}$ is the Burgers vector, and $\\mathbf{t}$ is the unit vector tangent to the dislocation line.\n\nThe givens are:\n- Dislocation line direction: $\\mathbf{t} = \\hat{\\mathbf{z}} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}$.\n- Burgers vector: $\\mathbf{b} = b\\,\\hat{\\mathbf{x}} = \\begin{pmatrix} b \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}$, with $b > 0$.\nThe configuration $\\mathbf{b} \\perp \\mathbf{t}$ confirms this is an edge dislocation.\nThe slip plane is the plane containing $\\mathbf{b}$ and $\\mathbf{t}$, which is the $x-z$ plane.\nThe glide direction is parallel to $\\mathbf{b}$, which is $\\hat{\\mathbf{x}}$. The climb direction is perpendicular to the slip plane, which is $\\hat{\\mathbf{y}}$.\n\nThe force vector $\\mathbf{F}$ lies in the $x-y$ plane because it must be perpendicular to $\\mathbf{t} = \\hat{\\mathbf{z}}$. The components of this force are resolved as follows:\n- The glide force per unit length, $f_{\\mathrm{glide}}$, is the component of $\\mathbf{F}$ along the glide direction $\\hat{\\mathbf{x}}$. Thus, $f_{\\mathrm{glide}} = \\mathbf{F} \\cdot \\hat{\\mathbf{x}} = F_x$.\n- The climb force per unit length, $f_{\\mathrm{climb}}$, is the component of $\\mathbf{F}$ along the climb direction $\\hat{\\mathbf{y}}$.

Due to the symmetry of the Cauchy stress tensor, $\\sigma_{yx} = \\sigma_{xy} = \\tau_{xy}$. In matrix form:\n$$ \\boldsymbol{\\sigma}^{(1)} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & \\tau_{xy} & 0 \\\\ \\tau_{xy} & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} $$\nFirst, we compute the vector $\\mathbf{v}^{(1)} = \\boldsymbol{\\sigma}^{(1)} \\cdot \\mathbf{b}$:\n$$ \\mathbf{v}^{(1)} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & \\tau_{xy} & 0 \\\\ \\tau_{xy} & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} b \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} (0)(b) + (\\tau_{xy})(0) + (0)(0) \\\\ (\\tau_{xy})(b) + (0)(0) + (0)(0) \\\\ (0)(b) + (0)(0) + (0)(0) \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ b\\tau_{xy} \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix} = b\\tau_{xy}\\hat{\\mathbf{y}} $$\nNext, we compute the force vector $\\mathbf{F}^{(1)}$ using the cross product:\n$$ \\mathbf{F}^{(1)} = \\mathbf{v}^{(1)} \\times \\mathbf{t} = (b\\tau_{xy}\\hat{\\mathbf{y}}) \\times (\\hat{\\mathbf{z}}) = b\\tau_{xy}(\\hat{\\mathbf{y}} \\times \\hat{\\mathbf{z}}) $$\nUsing the right-hand rule for the Cartesian basis vectors ($\\hat{\\mathbf{y}} \\times \\hat{\\mathbf{z}} = \\hat{\\mathbf{x}}$), we find:\n$$ \\mathbf{F}^{(1)} = b\\tau_{xy}\\hat{\\mathbf{x}} $$\nThe glide force per unit length is the $x$-component of this vector:\n$$ f_{\\mathrm{glide}} = F^{(1)}_x = b\\tau_{xy} $$\n\nPart 2: Climb force due to uniaxial normal stress $\\sigma_{yy}$\n\nThe applied stress tensor $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}^{(2)}$ has only one non-zero component, $\\sigma_{yy}$. In matrix form:\n$$ \\boldsymbol{\\sigma}^{(2)} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & \\sigma_{yy} & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} $$\nFirst, we compute the vector $\\mathbf{v}^{(2)} = \\boldsymbol{\\sigma}^{(2)} \\cdot \\mathbf{b}$:\n$$ \\mathbf{v}^{(2)} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & \\sigma_{yy} & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} b \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} (0)(b) + (0)(0) + (0)(0) \\\\ (0)(b) + (\\sigma_{yy})(0) + (0)(0) \\\\ (0)(b) + (0)(0) + (0)(0) \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix} = \\mathbf{0} $$\nNext, we compute the force vector $\\mathbf{F}^{(2)}$:\n$$ \\mathbf{F}^{(2)} = \\mathbf{v}^{(2)} \\times \\mathbf{t} = \\mathbf{0} \\times \\hat{\\mathbf{z}} = \\mathbf{0} $$\nThe resulting mechanical force vector is the null vector. The climb force per unit length is the $y$-component of this vector:\n$$ f_{\\mathrm{climb}} = F^{(2)}_y = 0 $$\nThis result follows directly and rigorously from the definition of mechanical force in linear elasticity. The Peach-Koehler formula does not account for thermodynamic forces associated with the diffusion of point defects (vacancies or interstitials), a process required for dislocation climb. The non-zero forces for climb discussed in some literature, such as the force proportional to $\\sigma_{xx}b$ (note, not $\\sigma_{yy}b$), arise from thermodynamic considerations that go beyond the strict application of the mechanical force formula. Based on the constraints of the problem, which specify using only \"standard linear elasticity and the definition of the mechanical force\", the mechanical climb force generated by $\\sigma_{yy}$ is precisely zero.\n\nThe final result is a two-component row vector containing the glide force from Part 1 and the climb force from Part 2.\n$$ \\left[f_{\\mathrm{glide}},\\,f_{\\mathrm{climb}}\\right] = \\left[b\\tau_{xy},\\,0\\right] $$", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\nb\\tau_{xy} & 0\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "2816704"}, {"introduction": "Dislocations rarely exist in isolation; their behavior is dominated by mutual interactions.

The position of dislocation $2$ relative to dislocation $1$ is given by the vector $(\\Delta x, \\Delta y) = (x-0, -s/2 - s/2) = (x, -s)$.

Thus, for equilibrium, the numerator must be zero:\n$$ x^{\\ast}((x^{\\ast})^2 - s^2) = 0 $$\nThis equation yields three possible horizontal equilibrium positions: $x^{\\ast} = 0$, $x^{\\ast} = s$, and $x^{\\ast} = -s$.\n\nTo determine the stability of these equilibria, we analyze the sign of the force $F_{2,x}(x)$ for small perturbations of $x$ around each $x^{\\ast}$. A stable equilibrium requires a restoring force, meaning the force opposes the displacement. Let $K = \\frac{\\mu b^2}{2\\pi(1-\\nu)} > 0$.

Thus, $F_{2,x} < 0$, again a repulsive force away from the origin.\n    Therefore, the equilibrium at $x^{\\ast} = 0$ is **unstable**.\n\n2.  **Equilibrium at $x^{\\ast} = s$**:\n    - For $x > s$, the sign of $x(x-s)(x+s)$ is $(+)(+)(+) = +$. Thus, $F_{2,x} < 0$, an attractive force pushing the dislocation back towards $x=s$.\n    - For $0 < x < s$, the sign of $x(x-s)(x+s)$ is $(+)(-)(+) = -$. Thus, $F_{2,x} > 0$, a repulsive force pushing the dislocation back towards $x=s$.\n    The force is restoring on both sides of $x=s$. Therefore, the equilibrium at $x^{\\ast} = s$ is **stable**.\n\n3.  **Equilibrium at $x^{\\ast} = -s$**:\n    - By symmetry, an identical analysis shows that the equilibrium at $x^{\\ast} = -s$ is also **stable**.\n    - For $-s < x < 0$, the sign of $x(x-s)(x+s)$ is $(-)(-)(+) = +$. Thus, $F_{2,x} < 0$, a force pushing towards $x=-s$.\n    - For $x < -s$, the sign of $x(x-s)(x+s)$ is $(-)(-)(-) = -$. Thus, $F_{2,x} > 0$, a force pushing towards $x=-s$.\n    The equilibrium at $x^{\\ast} = -s$ is also **stable**.\n\nThese stable equilibria at $x^{\\ast} = \\pm s$ signify that a stable dislocation dipole can form. The condition for formation is the existence of these stable points. The horizontal separation coordinate is $x^{\\ast}$. The configuration is stable when the magnitude of the horizontal separation $|x^{\\ast}|$ is equal to the vertical separation $s$. This corresponds to the line joining the two dislocations making an angle of $45^{\\circ}$ with the glide planes. The problem asks for \"the stable equilibrium horizontal separation $x^{\\ast}$\". Since separation is a measure of distance, it is a non-negative quantity. Both stable positions $x^{\\ast}=s$ and $x^{\\ast}=-s$ correspond to the same physical separation distance of $s$. By convention, we report the positive value.\n\nThe condition for the formation of a static dipole is the existence of stable equilibrium points under zero external stress, which we have found.
