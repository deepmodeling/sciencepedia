Classical pile-up analysis yields the scaling $N \\propto d\\,\\tau/\\left(G b\\right)$, where $G$ is the shear modulus and $b$ is the magnitude of the Burgers vector. Transmission into the next grain occurs when the stress concentration at the head meets a critical barrier stress that itself can be thermally assisted.

It requires the derivation of a fundamental scaling law from first principles, followed by its application to experimental data analysis. The problem is valid, and a full solution is warranted.\n\nThe primary objective is to determine the temperature-dependent parameters of the Hall-Petch relationship, which describes the increase in yield stress of a polycrystalline material with decreasing grain size. The relationship is given by:\n$$\n\\sigma_y = \\sigma_0 + k_y d^p\n$$\nwhere $\\sigma_y$ is the macroscopic yield stress, $d$ is the average grain diameter, $\\sigma_0$ is the friction stress (the stress required to move dislocations within a grain), $k_y$ is the grain boundary strengthening coefficient, and $p$ is a power-law exponent.\n\nFirst, we must derive the exponent $p$ from the provided physical picture of dislocation pile-ups. The problem states that the number of dislocations, $N$, in a pile-up of length scale $d$ under an effective resolved shear stress $\\tau_{eff}$ scales as $N \\propto d \\tau_{eff}$. Here, $\\tau_{eff} = \\tau - \\tau_i$, where $\\tau$ is the applied resolved shear stress and $\\tau_i$ is the lattice friction stress. The stress concentration at the head of this pile-up, $\\tau_{head}$, is amplified and scales with the number of dislocations in the pile-up. A standard model for this amplification gives $\\tau_{head} \\propto N \\tau_{eff}$.\n\nBy combining these two proportionalities, we find the relationship between the stress at the pile-up head and the applied stress:\n$$\n\\tau_{head} \\propto (d \\tau_{eff}) \\tau_{eff} = d \\tau_{eff}^2\n$$\nMacroscopic yielding occurs when plastic deformation transmits from one grain to the next. This happens when the stress at the pile-up head, $\\tau_{head}$, reaches a critical value, $\\tau_c^*$, required to activate dislocation sources in the adjacent grain. Setting $\\tau_{head} = \\tau_c^*$, we have:\n$$\n\\tau_c^* \\propto d \\tau_{eff}^2\n$$\nSolving for the effective stress required to cause yielding, we obtain:\n$$\n\\tau_{eff}^2 \\propto \\frac{1}{d} \\implies \\tau_{eff} \\propto d^{-1/2}\n$$\nThis effective stress represents the contribution to strength from the grain boundaries. The total resolved shear stress for yielding, $\\tau_y$, is the sum of the lattice friction stress $\\tau_i$ and this grain boundary contribution:\n$$\n\\tau_y = \\tau_i + C d^{-1/2}\n$$\nwhere $C$ is a proportionality constant. The macroscopic yield stress, $\\sigma_y$, is related to the resolved shear stress by the Taylor factor, $M$, which averages over all grain orientations: $\\sigma_y = M \\tau_y$.\n$$\n\\sigma_y = M(\\tau_i + C d^{-1/2}) = M\\tau_i + M C d^{-1/2}\n$$\nBy defining the macroscopic friction stress as $\\sigma_0 = M\\tau_i$ and the grain boundary strengthening coefficient as $k_y = MC$, we arrive at the classical Hall-Petch equation:\n$$\n\\sigma_y = \\sigma_0 + k_y d^{-1/2}\n$$\nThus, the power-law exponent is $p = -1/2$. This relation is linear in the variable $x = d^{-1/2}$. We can write it as $y = c + m x$, where $y = \\sigma_y$, $c = \\sigma_0$, and $m = k_y$.\n\nTo extract the parameters $\\sigma_0(T)$ and $k_y(T)$ from the provided data, we must perform an ordinary least squares (OLS) linear regression of $\\sigma_y$ on $d^{-1/2}$ for each temperature, $T_1 = 300\\,\\mathrm{K}$ and $T_2 = 600\\,\\mathrm{K}$. For a set of $n$ data points $(x_i, y_i)$, the OLS method finds the slope $m$ and intercept $c$ that minimize the sum of squared residuals. The analytical solutions for $m$ and $c$ are:\n$$\nm = k_y = \\frac{n \\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i y_i - (\\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i)(\\sum_{i=1}^{n} y_i)}{n \\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i^2 - (\\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i)^2}\n$$\n$$\nc = \\sigma_0 = \\bar{y} - m \\bar{x}\n$$\nwhere $\\bar{x}$ and $\\bar{y}$ are the arithmetic means of the $x_i$ and $y_i$ values, respectively.\n\nThe calculations are performed for the two given temperature datasets. The physical quantities of interest are then derived:\n1.  The parameters $k_y(T_1)$, $\\sigma_0(T_1)$, $k_y(T_2)$, and $\\sigma_0(T_2)$.\n2.  The ratio $r \\equiv k_y(T_2)/k_y(T_1)$.\n3.  A boolean flag $b$, which is True if $k_y(T_2) < k_y(T_1)$ and False otherwise.\n\nThe temperature dependence of $k_y$ provides insight into the underlying physical mechanisms. A decrease in $k_y$ with increasing temperature, as observed in the data, is consistent with two primary effects:\n-   **Thermally assisted slip transmission**: The activation of dislocation sources across a grain boundary is a thermally activated process. Higher temperatures provide thermal energy that assists the pile-up stress in overcoming the activation barrier, thus requiring a smaller pile-up (and lower applied stress) to initiate yielding in the next grain.\n-   **Grain boundary softening**: At elevated temperatures, atomic mobility increases, allowing for more efficient stress relaxation at grain boundaries through mechanisms like grain boundary diffusion and sliding. This makes the boundaries \"softer\" obstacles to dislocation motion.\n\nBoth phenomena reduce the effectiveness of grain boundaries as barriers to slip, leading to a smaller $k_y$ value at higher temperatures. The observed decrease in the friction stress $\\sigma_0$ with temperature is also expected, as dislocation glide within the crystal lattice is itself a thermally activated process.

We use the moment formula with $n = -1/2$:\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}[d^{-1/2}] = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{1}{2}\\mu + \\frac{(-1/2)^{2}s^{2}}{2}\\right) = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\mu}{2} + \\frac{s^{2}}{8}\\right)\n$$\nNow, substitute the expression for $\\mu = \\ln \\bar{d} - s^{2}/2$ into this equation:\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}[d^{-1/2}] = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\ln \\bar{d} - \\frac{s^{2}}{2}\\right) + \\frac{s^{2}}{8}\\right) = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{1}{2}\\ln \\bar{d} + \\frac{s^{2}}{4} + \\frac{s^{2}}{8}\\right)\n$$\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}[d^{-1/2}] = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{1}{2}\\ln \\bar{d} + \\frac{3s^{2}}{8}\\right) = \\exp(\\ln \\bar{d}^{-1/2}) \\exp\\left(\\frac{3s^{2}}{8}\\right) = \\bar{d}^{-1/2} \\exp\\left(\\frac{3s^{2}}{8}\\right)\n$$\nSubstituting this result back into the expression for $\\sigma_{\\mathrm{eff}}$:\n$$\n\\sigma_{\\mathrm{eff}} = \\sigma_{i} + k_{y} \\bar{d}^{-1/2} \\exp\\left(\\frac{3s^{2}}{8}\\right)\n$$\nWe are asked to find the ratio $R \\equiv \\sigma_{\\mathrm{eff}} / \\sigma_{\\mathrm{mean}}$.\n$$\nR = \\frac{\\sigma_{i} + k_{y} \\bar{d}^{-1/2} \\exp\\left(\\frac{3s^{2}}{8}\\right)}{\\sigma_{i} + k_{y} \\bar{d}^{-1/2}}\n$$\nThis is the required exact closed-form expression for the ratio $R$.\n\nNow, we evaluate this expression numerically using the given data:\n$\\sigma_{i} = 150\\,\\mathrm{MPa}$\n$k_{y} = 0.6\\,\\mathrm{MPa}\\cdot\\mathrm{m}^{1/2}$\n$\\bar{d} = 10\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m} = 10 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{m} = 10^{-5}\\,\\mathrm{m}$\n$s = 0.6$\n\nFirst, let us compute the grain size strengthening term evaluated at the mean grain size, ensuring consistent units.\n$$\nk_{y} \\bar{d}^{-1/2} = (0.6\\,\\mathrm{MPa}\\cdot\\mathrm{m}^{1/2}) \\times (10^{-5}\\,\\mathrm{m})^{-1/2} = 0.6 \\times 10^{2.5}\\,\\mathrm{MPa} = 0.6 \\times \\sqrt{10^5}\\,\\mathrm{MPa}\n$$\n$$\nk_{y} \\bar{d}^{-1/2} \\approx 0.6 \\times 316.227766\\,\\mathrm{MPa} \\approx 189.73666\\,\\mathrm{MPa}\n$$\nNext, we compute the exponential factor:\n$$\n\\frac{3s^{2}}{8} = \\frac{3 \\times (0.6)^{2}}{8} = \\frac{3 \\times 0.36}{8} = \\frac{1.08}{8} = 0.135\n$$\n$$\n\\exp\\left(\\frac{3s^{2}}{8}\\right) = \\exp(0.135) \\approx 1.1445408\n$$\nNow, substitute these numerical values into the expression for $R$:\n$$\nR = \\frac{150\\,\\mathrm{MPa} + (189.73666\\,\\mathrm{MPa}) \\times \\exp(0.135)}{150\\,\\mathrm{MPa} + 189.73666\\,\\mathrm{MPa}}\n$$\n$$\nR \\approx \\frac{150 + 189.73666 \\times 1.1445408}{150 + 189.73666} = \\frac{150 + 217.15814}{339.73666} = \\frac{367.15814}{339.73666} \\approx 1.080713\n$$\nThe problem requires the answer rounded to four significant figures.\n$$\nR \\approx 1.081\n$$\nThis result, greater than $1$, is physically sensible. Due to the concavity of the function $d^{-1/2}$, Jensen's inequality implies $\\mathbb{E}[d^{-1/2}] \\ge (\\mathbb{E}[d])^{-1/2} = \\bar{d}^{-1/2}$. The distribution of grain sizes leads to an effective yield strength that is higher than the strength calculated using only the average grain size.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{1.081}\n$$", "id": "2826539"}]}
