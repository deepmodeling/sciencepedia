It is self-contained, scientifically grounded in the principles of solid mechanics and energy conservation, and well-posed. The parameters provided are physically realistic and dimensionally consistent. Therefore, the problem is valid, and we shall proceed with its formal solution.\n\nThe derivation begins with the first principle of energy balance for a quasi-static crack growth process. The total potential energy, $\\Pi$, of an elastic body is the difference between its stored elastic strain energy, $U$, and the work, $W$, done on it by external forces:\n$$ \\Pi = U - W $$\nThe energy release rate, $G$, is defined as the negative rate of change of the total potential energy with respect to the crack area, $A$. For a through-thickness crack of total length $2a$ in a plate of unit thickness ($t=1$), the crack surface area is $A = 2a \\times t = 2a$. The derivative of the area with respect to the crack half-length $a$ is $\\frac{dA}{da} = 2$. Therefore, $G$ is given by:\n$$ G = -\\frac{d\\Pi}{dA} = -\\frac{d\\Pi}{da}\\frac{da}{dA} = -\\frac{1}{2}\\frac{d\\Pi}{da} $$\nThe problem specifies a constant remote tensile stress $\\sigma_{\\infty}$, which corresponds to a fixed-load condition. For a linearly elastic material under fixed load, the work done by the external forces is twice the stored strain energy, $W = 2U$. When the crack extends by an infinitesimal amount, causing a change in compliance, the incremental change in work done relates to the incremental change in strain energy as $dW = 2dU$. The corresponding change in potential energy is:\n$$ d\\Pi = dU - dW = dU - 2dU = -dU $$\nSubstituting this into the expression for $G$ yields:\n$$ G = -\\frac{1}{2}\\frac{(-dU)}{da} = \\frac{1}{2}\\frac{dU}{da} $$\nTo evaluate this, we must find the total strain energy $U$ as a function of the crack half-length $a$. Let $U_0$ be the strain energy of the uncracked plate. The introduction of a crack of length $2a$ increases the compliance of the plate, and thus increases the total stored strain energy. The total strain energy of the cracked plate is $U(a) = U_0 + \\Delta U(a)$, where $\\Delta U(a)$ is the additional strain energy due to the presence of the crack. Since $U_0$ is independent of $a$, its derivative is zero. Thus, we have:\n$$ G = \\frac{1}{2}\\frac{d}{da}\\left(U_0 + \\Delta U(a)\\right) = \\frac{1}{2}\\frac{d(\\Delta U)}{da} $$\nFrom the theory of elasticity for an infinite, isotropic plate under plane-stress conditions with a central through-crack of length $2a$, the increase in strain energy for a plate of unit thickness is given by:\n$$ \\Delta U(a) = \\frac{\\pi \\sigma_{\\infty}^2 a^2}{E} $$\nwhere $E$ is the Young's modulus. Differentiating this expression with respect to $a$ gives:\n$$ \\frac{d(\\Delta U)}{da} = \\frac{d}{da} \\left( \\frac{\\pi \\sigma_{\\infty}^2 a^2}{E} \\right) = \\frac{2\\pi \\sigma_{\\infty}^2 a}{E} $$\nSubstituting this result into the expression for $G$:\n$$ G = \\frac{1}{2} \\left( \\frac{2\\pi \\sigma_{\\infty}^2 a}{E} \\right) = \\frac{\\pi \\sigma_{\\infty}^2 a}{E} $$\nThis is the closed-form expression for the energy release rate for this configuration.\n\nNext, we apply the Griffith criterion for crack propagation, which states that the crack will grow when the energy release rate $G$ reaches a critical value, the material's fracture toughness, $G_c$. The critical stress, $\\sigma_c$, is the far-field stress at which this condition is met:\n$$ G = G_c \\implies \\frac{\\pi \\sigma_c^2 a}{E} = G_c $$\nSolving for the critical stress $\\sigma_c$ yields:\n$$ \\sigma_c^2 = \\frac{E G_c}{\\pi a} $$\n$$ \\sigma_c = \\sqrt{\\frac{E G_c}{\\pi a}} $$\nThis is the expression for the critical stress required for fracture.\n\nWe now evaluate these expressions numerically using the provided data.

The history variable is $H_0(t) = \\max_{\\tau \\in [0,t]} \\Psi_0(\\varepsilon(\\tau))$.\n-   For the tension-compression split model, damage is driven only by the tensile part of the strain energy. The strain is split into tensile and compressive parts: $\\varepsilon_{+} = \\max(\\varepsilon, 0)$ and $\\varepsilon_{-} = \\min(\\varepsilon, 0)$. The corresponding energy densities are $\\Psi_{+}(\\varepsilon) = \\frac{1}{2} E \\varepsilon_{+}^2$ and $\\Psi_{-}(\\varepsilon) = \\frac{1}{2} E \\varepsilon_{-}^2$. The total elastic energy is $\\Psi_0(\\varepsilon) = \\Psi_{+}(\\varepsilon) + \\Psi_{-}(\\varepsilon)$. Only $\\Psi_{+}(\\varepsilon)$ contributes to damage. The history variable is thus $H_{+}(t) = \\max_{\\tau \\in [0,t]} \\Psi_{+}(\\varepsilon(\\tau))$.\n\nOur first objective is to derive the closed-form expression for the damage variable $d^{\\star}$ that minimizes the free energy functional $\\mathcal{W}(d; H)$ for a given value of the history variable $H$. We substitute the expressions for $g(d)$ and $w(d)$:\n$$\n\\mathcal{W}(d; H) = \\left( (1 - d)^2 + \\kappa \\right) H + \\frac{G_c}{2 \\ell} d^2\n$$\nTo find the minimum, we seek the stationary point by taking the derivative with respect to $d$ and setting it to zero. The term $\\kappa H$ is independent of $d$ and vanishes upon differentiation.\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial \\mathcal{W}}{\\partial d} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial d} \\left( (1 - 2d + d^2) H + \\kappa H + \\frac{G_c}{2 \\ell} d^2 \\right) = (-2 + 2d) H + \\frac{G_c}{\\ell} d = 0\n$$\nSolving for $d$:\n$$\n-2H + 2Hd + \\frac{G_c}{\\ell} d = 0\n$$\n$$\nd \\left( 2H + \\frac{G_c}{\\ell} \\right) = 2H\n$$\nThis gives the unconstrained minimizer:\n$$\nd^{\\star}_{unc}(H) = \\frac{2H}{2H + G_c/\\ell} = \\frac{2 \\ell H}{2 \\ell H + G_c}\n$$\nThe second derivative, $\\frac{\\partial^2 \\mathcal{W}}{\\partial d^2} = 2H + \\frac{G_c}{\\ell}$, is strictly positive for any physically meaningful parameters ($H \\ge 0$, $G_c > 0$, $\\ell > 0$), confirming that this stationary point is indeed a minimum.\n\nWe must now enforce the physical constraint that $d \\in [0, 1]$.\n-   Since $H \\ge 0$, $G_c > 0$, and $\\ell > 0$, the numerator and denominator are non-negative, so $d^{\\star}_{unc}(H) \\ge 0$. The lower bound is satisfied.\n-   For the upper bound: $d^{\\star}_{unc}(H) = \\frac{2 \\ell H}{2 \\ell H + G_c} < \\frac{2 \\ell H + G_c}{2 \\ell H + G_c} = 1$. The upper bound is also naturally satisfied.\nThus, the optimal damage $d^{\\star}$ for a given history value $H$ lies within the valid range $[0, 1]$ and is given by the derived expression. We can reformulate it for numerical stability as:\n$$\nd^{\\star}(H) = \\frac{H}{H + \\frac{G_c}{2 \\ell}}\n$$\nThis is the closed-form damage update rule. It is a monotonically increasing function of $H$. Because the history variable $H$ is non-decreasing by definition, the resulting damage $d(t) = d^{\\star}(H(t))$ is also non-decreasing, automatically satisfying irreversibility.\n\nFor any given strain history $\\{\\varepsilon(t)\\}$, we first compute the final history variable $H_0$ or $H_+$ by finding the maximum of the respective energy density over the entire history. Then, we use the derived formula $d^{\\star}(H)$ to compute the final damage values $d_0$ and $d_+$.\n-   Unsplit damage: $d_0 = d^{\\star}(H_0)$, where $H_0 = \\max_{t} \\left(\\frac{1}{2} E (\\varepsilon(t))^2\\right)$.\n-   Split damage: $d_+ = d^{\\star}(H_+)$, where $H_+ = \\max_{t} \\left(\\frac{1}{2} E (\\max(\\varepsilon(t), 0))^2\\right)$.\n\nThis framework will now be implemented to evaluate the four specified test cases and demonstrate the superiority of the tension-compression split model.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Derives and computes damage in a 1D phase-field fracture model,\n    comparing a standard (unsplit) model with a tension-compression split model.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Material parameters\n    E = 2.10e11  # Young's modulus in Pascals (Pa)\n    Gc = 2.70e3   # Critical energy release rate in Joules/m^2 (J/m^2)\n    l_char = 2.00e-3   # Characteristic length scale in meters (m)\n    \n    # Test cases: strain history paths (dimensionless)\n    test_suite = [\n        # Case A: Pure compression\n        (\"A\", np.array([-5.0e-3])),\n        # Case B: Pure tension\n        (\"B\", np.array([5.0e-3])),\n        # Case C: Compression-unload-tension\n        (\"C\", np.array([-5.0e-3, 0.0, 3.0e-3])),\n        # Case D: Zero strain boundary case\n        (\"D\", np.array([0.0])),\n    ]\n\n    # Pre-compute the denominator term group for the damage formula\n    fracture_res = Gc / (2 * l_char)\n    \n    def calculate_damage(H, fracture_resistance):\n        \"\"\"\n        Calculates damage based on the derived closed-form solution:\n        d*(H) = H / (H + Gc/(2*l))\n        \"\"\"\n        if H <= 0:\n            return 0.0\n        return H / (H + fracture_resistance)\n\n    all_results_str = []\n    TOL = 1.0e-12\n\n    for case_id, strain_path in test_suite:\n        # Calculate history variable H0 for the unsplit model\n        psi0_path = 0.5 * E * strain_path**2\n        H0 = np.max(psi0_path) if psi0_path.size > 0 else 0.0\n        d0 = calculate_damage(H0, fracture_res)\n\n        # Calculate history variable H+ for the tension-compression split model\n        strain_plus_path = np.maximum(strain_path, 0)\n        psi_plus_path = 0.5 * E * strain_plus_path**2\n        H_plus = np.max(psi_plus_path) if psi_plus_path.size > 0 else 0.0\n        d_plus = calculate_damage(H_plus, fracture_res)\n\n        # Format damage values to six decimal places for output\n        d0_rounded_str = f\"{d0:.6f}\"\n        d_plus_rounded_str = f\"{d_plus:.6f}\"\n        \n        # Perform case-specific boolean checks\n        case_result_items = []\n        if case_id == \"A\":\n            b_A1 = abs(d_plus) < TOL  # d+ is zero\n            b_A2 = d0 > TOL           # d0 is strictly positive\n            case_result_items = [d0_rounded_str, d_plus_rounded_str, str(b_A1), str(b_A2)]\n        elif case_id == \"B\":\n            b_B = abs(d_plus - d0) < TOL  # d+ equals d0\n            case_result_items = [d0_rounded_str, d_plus_rounded_str, str(b_B)]\n        elif case_id == \"C\":\n            b_C = (d0 - d_plus) > TOL  # d+ is strictly less than d0\n            case_result_items = [d0_rounded_str, d_plus_rounded_str, str(b_C)]\n        elif case_id == \"D\":\n            b_D = abs(d_plus) < TOL and abs(d0) < TOL  # both are zero\n            case_result_items = [d0_rounded_str, d_plus_rounded_str, str(b_D)]\n        \n        # Format the result list for this case into a string\n        all_results_str.append(f\"[{','.join(case_result_items)}]\")\n\n    # Print the final result string in the required format\n    # print(f\"[{','.join(all_results_str)}]\")\n```", "answer": "```\n[[0.795455,0.000000,True,True],[0.795455,0.795455,True],[0.795455,0.583333,True],[0.000000,0.000000,True]]\n```", "id": "2824783"}]}
