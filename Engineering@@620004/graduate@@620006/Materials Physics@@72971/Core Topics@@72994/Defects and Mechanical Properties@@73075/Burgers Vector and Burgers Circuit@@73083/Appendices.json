A complete, reasoned solution will be provided.\n\nThe displacement field $\\mathbf{u}$ is a function of $x$ and $y$ only, so $\\mathbf{u} = \\mathbf{u}(x,y)$, meaning all partial derivatives with respect to $z$ are zero, $\\partial_z = 0$.

The first two equations involve only $u_x$ and $u_y$, while the third equation involves only $u_z$.\n\n1. We first address the equation for $u_z(x,y)$. Substituting the expressions for $\\sigma_{xz}$ and $\\sigma_{yz}$ into the third equilibrium equation ($i=z$):\n$$\n\\partial_x(\\mu \\partial_x u_z) + \\partial_y(\\mu \\partial_y u_z) = 0\n$$\nSince the shear modulus $\\mu$ is a non-zero constant for a homogeneous material, this simplifies to:\n$$\n\\mu (\\partial_x^2 u_z + \\partial_y^2 u_z) = 0 \\implies \\partial_x^2 u_z + \\partial_y^2 u_z = 0\n$$\nThis is the two-dimensional Laplace equation for $u_z(x,y)$, $\\nabla^2 u_z = 0$.\nNow consider the equations for $u_x$ and $u_y$. These are the equations of plane strain elasticity. The defining property of the Burgers vector is given as $\\oint_C (\\nabla \\mathbf{u}) \\cdot d\\mathbf{r} = \\mathbf{b}$. The components of this vector equation are $\\oint_C \\nabla u_i \\cdot d\\mathbf{r} = b_i$. This is equivalent to $\\oint_C du_i = b_i$. For the screw dislocation, $\\mathbf{b} = (0,0,b)$, so we have:\n$$\n\\oint_C du_x = 0, \\quad \\oint_C du_y = 0, \\quad \\oint_C du_z = b\n$$\nThe conditions $\\oint du_x = 0$ and $\\oint du_y = 0$ imply that $u_x$ and $u_y$ must be single-valued functions in the domain. For an elastic body with a hole, subject to no body forces and with stresses that vanish at infinity, the only single-valued displacement solution that does not generate stress is a rigid-body motion. By an appropriate choice of coordinate system, this rigid-body motion can be set to zero. Thus, we can take $u_x(x,y)=0$ and $u_y(x,y)=0$. This demonstrates that the only non-zero displacement component can be chosen as $u_z(x,y)$, and it must satisfy the 2D Laplace equation in the plane outside the core.\n\n2. To find the solution for $u_z(x,y)$, we solve $\\nabla^2 u_z = 0$ in the domain $\\mathbb{R}^2 \\setminus \\{(0,0)\\}$. It is most convenient to use polar coordinates $(r, \\theta)$, where $x=r\\cos\\theta$ and $y=r\\sin\\theta$. The Laplace equation is:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial^2 u_z}{\\partial r^2} + \\frac{1}{r} \\frac{\\partial u_z}{\\partial r} + \\frac{1}{r^2} \\frac{\\partial^2 u_z}{\\partial \\theta^2} = 0\n$$\nThe displacement field around a dislocation is expected to be independent of path details far from the core, suggesting a solution that is primarily dependent on the angle $\\theta$. Let us try a solution of the form $u_z(r, \\theta) = f(\\theta)$. Substituting this into the Laplace equation gives:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{r^2} \\frac{d^2 f}{d\\theta^2} = 0 \\implies \\frac{d^2 f}{d\\theta^2} = 0\n$$\nThe general solution is $f(\\theta) = C_1 \\theta + C_2$, for some constants $C_1$ and $C_2$. Thus, $u_z(x,y) = C_1 \\theta(x,y) + C_2$. The polar angle is $\\theta = \\arctan(y/x)$. This function is multivalued: as one encircles the origin, $\\theta$ increases by $2\\pi$. The displacement $u_z$ jumps by $2\\pi C_1$ across a cut-plane (e.g., the positive $x$-axis), which is the characteristic of a dislocation.\nThe constant $C_1$ is determined from the Burgers circuit condition $\\oint_C du_z = b$. Let's choose the circuit to be a circle of radius $R$ centered at the origin. The differential of displacement is $du_z = \\frac{\\partial u_z}{\\partial \\theta} d\\theta = C_1 d\\theta$. The line integral is:\n$$\n\\oint_C du_z = \\int_0^{2\\pi} C_1 d\\theta = C_1 [\\theta]_0^{2\\pi} = 2\\pi C_1\n$$\nEquating this to the magnitude of the Burgers vector, $b$:\n$$\n2\\pi C_1 = b \\implies C_1 = \\frac{b}{2\\pi}\n$$\nThe constant $C_2$ represents a rigid-body translation along the $z$-axis and can be set to zero without loss of generality. Therefore, the displacement field is:\n$$\nu_z(x,y) = \\frac{b}{2\\pi}\\theta(x,y) = \\frac{b}{2\\pi}\\arctan\\left(\\frac{y}{x}\\right)\n$$\n\n3. We are asked to evaluate the scalar circulation $I \\equiv \\oint_{C_{R}} \\nabla u_{z}\\cdot d\\mathbf{r}$ for a circular path $C_R$ of radius $R>0$.\nThe integrand $\\nabla u_z \\cdot d\\mathbf{r}$ is the dot product of the gradient of $u_z$ with the differential displacement vector $d\\mathbf{r}$. In Cartesian coordinates, $\\nabla u_z = \\frac{\\partial u_z}{\\partial x}\\hat{\\mathbf{x}} + \\frac{\\partial u_z}{\\partial y}\\hat{\\mathbf{y}}$ and $d\\mathbf{r} = dx\\,\\hat{\\mathbf{x}} + dy\\,\\hat{\\mathbf{y}}$. Their dot product is:\n$$\n\\nabla u_z \\cdot d\\mathbf{r} = \\frac{\\partial u_z}{\\partial x}dx + \\frac{\\partial u_z}{\\partial y}dy\n$$\nThis is precisely the definition of the total differential $du_z$ of the function $u_z(x,y)$. Therefore, the integral $I$ is:\n$$\nI = \\oint_{C_R} du_z\n$$\nFrom the problem's definition and our analysis in part 1, this integral around any circuit enclosing the dislocation core is equal to the z-component of the Burgers vector, which is $b$.\nWe can also verify this by direct calculation using the solution from part 2. We found $u_z = \\frac{b}{2\\pi}\\theta$.\nThe integral is $I = \\oint_{C_R} d\\left(\\frac{b}{2\\pi}\\theta\\right) = \\frac{b}{2\\pi} \\oint_{C_R} d\\theta$.\nThe path $C_R$ is a counterclockwise circle around the origin.

The problem states that we can assume a common prefactor $K$ for all three dislocations involved.\n\nThe energy per unit length of the initial state, consisting of one perfect dislocation, is:\n$$ E_{initial} = E_{0} = K |\\mathbf{b}_{0}|^2 $$\nThe energy per unit length of the final state, consisting of two partial dislocations, is the sum of their individual energies (neglecting their interaction energy, as is standard for this type of criterion):\n$$ E_{final} = E_{1} + E_{2} = K |\\mathbf{b}_{1}|^2 + K |\\mathbf{b}_{2}|^2 $$\nA reaction is energetically favorable if it leads to a decrease in the total elastic energy. Thus, the condition for the dissociation to be allowed is:\n$$ E_{final} < E_{initial} $$\n$$ K |\\mathbf{b}_{1}|^2 + K |\\mathbf{b}_{2}|^2 < K |\\mathbf{b}_{0}|^2 $$\nSince $K$ is a positive constant, this simplifies to Frank's energy criterion:\n$$ |\\mathbf{b}_{1}|^2 + |\\mathbf{b}_{2}|^2 < |\\mathbf{b}_{0}|^2 $$\nThis is equivalent to the change in an energy-related term, $|\\mathbf{b}_{1}|^2 + |\\mathbf{b}_{2}|^2 - |\\mathbf{b}_{0}|^2$, being negative. The problem asks for the calculation of the dimensionless factor $\\Delta$, which is precisely this change normalized by $a^2$. The sign of $\\Delta$ will determine the energetic favorability of the reaction.\n\nWe must compute the squared magnitudes of the given Burgers vectors. For a vector $\\mathbf{v} = C[v_x, v_y, v_z]$, the squared magnitude is $|\\mathbf{v}|^2 = C^2(v_x^2 + v_y^2 + v_z^2)$.\n\nFor the perfect dislocation with $\\mathbf{b}_{0}=\\dfrac{a}{2}[1, 1, 0]$:\n$$ |\\mathbf{b}_{0}|^2 = \\left(\\frac{a}{2}\\right)^2 (1^2 + 1^2 + 0^2) = \\frac{a^2}{4}(1 + 1 + 0) = \\frac{a^2}{4}(2) = \\frac{a^2}{2} $$\n\nFor the first partial dislocation with $\\mathbf{b}_{1}=\\dfrac{a}{6}[2, 1, 1]$:\n$$ |\\mathbf{b}_{1}|^2 = \\left(\\frac{a}{6}\\right)^2 (2^2 + 1^2 + 1^2) = \\frac{a^2}{36}(4 + 1 + 1) = \\frac{a^2}{36}(6) = \\frac{a^2}{6} $$\n\nFor the second partial dislocation with $\\mathbf{b}_{2}=\\dfrac{a}{6}[1, 2, -1]$:\n$$ |\\mathbf{b}_{2}|^2 = \\left(\\frac{a}{6}\\right)^2 (1^2 + 2^2 + (-1)^2) = \\frac{a^2}{36}(1 + 4 + 1) = \\frac{a^2}{36}(6) = \\frac{a^2}{6} $$\n\nNow, substitute these magnitudes into the definition of $\\Delta$:\n$$ \\Delta = \\frac{|\\mathbf{b}_{1}|^{2}+|\\mathbf{b}_{2}|^{2}-|\\mathbf{b}_{0}|^{2}}{a^{2}} = \\frac{\\frac{a^2}{6} + \\frac{a^2}{6} - \\frac{a^2}{2}}{a^{2}} $$\nFactor out $a^2$ from the numerator and cancel with the denominator:\n$$ \\Delta = \\frac{1}{6} + \\frac{1}{6} - \\frac{1}{2} $$\nCombine the terms by finding a common denominator of $6$:\n$$ \\Delta = \\frac{1}{6} + \\frac{1}{6} - \\frac{3}{6} = \\frac{1+1-3}{6} = \\frac{-1}{6} $$\nThe computed value is $\\Delta = -\\dfrac{1}{6}$.\n\nSince $\\Delta < 0$, we have $|\\mathbf{b}_{1}|^2 + |\\mathbf{b}_{2}|^2 - |\\mathbf{b}_{0}|^2 < 0$, which implies $|\\mathbf{b}_{1}|^2 + |\\mathbf{b}_{2}|^2 < |\\mathbf{b}_{0}|^2$. Based on Frank's criterion, this indicates that the total elastic self-energy per unit length of the dislocations decreases during the reaction. Consequently, the dissociation of the perfect dislocation into the two specified Shockley partial dislocations is energetically allowed. The problem requires the exact value of $\\Delta$.", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{-\\frac{1}{6}} $$", "id": "2804887"}]}
