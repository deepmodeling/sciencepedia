Derivation of the Band Dispersion $E(k)$**\n\nAccording to Bloch's theorem, the eigenstates of a periodic potential can be written as Bloch states. For a one-dimensional lattice, a Bloch state $|\\psi_k\\rangle$ is a superposition of the localized atomic orbitals $|n\\rangle$, weighted by a phase factor dependent on the crystal momentum $k$:\n$$\n|\\psi_k\\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{N}} \\sum_{n} e^{ikx_n} |n\\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{N}} \\sum_{n} e^{ikan} |n\\rangle\n$$\nwhere $N$ is the number of sites in the lattice, $n$ is an integer indexing the lattice sites, and $k$ is the wavevector.\n\nThe energy eigenvalues $E(k)$ are found by solving the time-independent Schrödinger equation:\n$$\n\\hat{H}|\\psi_k\\rangle = E(k)|\\psi_k\\rangle\n$$\nWe apply the given Hamiltonian $\\hat{H}$ to the Bloch state $|\\psi_k\\rangle$. It is computationally simpler to first determine the action of $\\hat{H}$ on a single localized orbital $|n\\rangle$:\n$$\n\\hat{H}|n\\rangle = \\left(\\varepsilon_{0}\\sum_{m}|m\\rangle\\langle m| - t \\sum_{m}\\Big(|m\\rangle\\langle m+1|+|m+1\\rangle\\langle m|\\Big)\\right)|n\\rangle\n$$\nUsing the orthonormality of the basis, $\\langle m|n\\rangle = \\delta_{mn}$, we find:\n$$\n\\hat{H}|n\\rangle = \\varepsilon_0|n\\rangle - t(|n-1\\rangle + |n+1\\rangle)\n$$\nNow, we apply $\\hat{H}$ to the full Bloch state:\n$$\n\\hat{H}|\\psi_k\\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{N}} \\sum_{n} e^{ikan} \\hat{H}|n\\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{N}} \\sum_{n} e^{ikan} \\Big(\\varepsilon_0|n\\rangle - t|n-1\\rangle - t|n+1\\rangle\\Big)\n$$\nTo find the eigenvalue $E(k)$, we may project onto one of the basis kets, for instance $\\langle m|$:\n$$\n\\langle m|\\hat{H}|\\psi_k\\rangle = E(k)\\langle m|\\psi_k\\rangle\n$$\nThe right-hand side is:\n$$\nE(k)\\langle m|\\psi_k\\rangle = E(k) \\left\\langle m \\left| \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{N}} \\sum_{n} e^{ikan} |n\\rangle \\right. \\right\\rangle = \\frac{E(k)}{\\sqrt{N}} \\sum_{n} e^{ikan} \\delta_{mn} = \\frac{E(k)}{\\sqrt{N}}e^{ikam}\n$$\nThe left-hand side is:\n$$\n\\langle m|\\hat{H}|\\psi_k\\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{N}} \\sum_{n} e^{ikan} \\langle m| \\Big(\\varepsilon_0|n\\rangle - t|n-1\\rangle - t|n+1\\rangle\\Big) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{N}} \\sum_{n} e^{ikan} (\\varepsilon_0 \\delta_{mn} - t \\delta_{m,n+1} - t \\delta_{m,n-1})\n$$\nThe sum has non-zero contributions only when $n=m$, $n=m-1$, and $n=m+1$. Evaluating these terms:\n$$\n\\langle m|\\hat{H}|\\psi_k\\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{N}} \\Big( e^{ikam}\\varepsilon_0 - e^{ik a (m+1)}t - e^{ik a (m-1)}t \\Big) = \\frac{e^{ikam}}{\\sqrt{N}} \\Big( \\varepsilon_0 - t(e^{ika} + e^{-ika}) \\Big)\n$$\nEquating the left and right sides yields:\n$$\n\\frac{E(k)}{\\sqrt{N}}e^{ikam} = \\frac{e^{ikam}}{\\sqrt{N}} \\Big( \\varepsilon_0 - t(e^{ika} + e^{-ika}) \\Big)\n$$\nThis gives the energy dispersion relation. Using the Euler identity $2\\cos(x) = e^{ix} + e^{-ix}$:\n$$\nE(k) = \\varepsilon_0 - 2t\\cos(ka)\n$$\n\n**2. Calculation of the Effective Mass $m^*$**\n\nThe semiclassical effective mass $m^*$ near a band extremum is defined from the curvature of the energy band. In one dimension, the formula is:\n$$\nm^* = \\hbar^2 \\left( \\frac{d^2E}{dk^2} \\right)^{-1}\n$$\nwhere $\\hbar$ is the reduced Planck constant.\n\nFirst, we must identify the location of the bottom of the band. The energy $E(k)$ is minimized when the term $-2t\\cos(ka)$ is at its most negative value. Since $t>0$, this occurs when $\\cos(ka)$ is maximized, i.e., $\\cos(ka)=1$. In the first Brillouin zone, $k \\in [-\\pi/a, \\pi/a]$, this condition is met at the zone center, $k=0$. This point corresponds to the bottom of the band.\n\nNext, we compute the second derivative of $E(k)$ with respect to $k$. The first derivative is:\n$$\n\\frac{dE}{dk} = \\frac{d}{dk} \\Big( \\varepsilon_0 - 2t\\cos(ka) \\Big) = -2t(-\\sin(ka) \\cdot a) = 2ta \\sin(ka)\n$$\nThe second derivative is:\n$$\n\\frac{d^2E}{dk^2} = \\frac{d}{dk} \\Big( 2ta \\sin(ka) \\Big) = 2ta (\\cos(ka) \\cdot a) = 2ta^2 \\cos(ka)\n$$\nWe evaluate this second derivative at the band bottom, $k=0$:\n$$\n\\left. \\frac{d^2E}{dk^2} \\right|_{k=0} = 2ta^2 \\cos(0) = 2ta^2\n$$\nSince this quantity is positive (as $t>0$ and $a>0$), it correctly describes a band minimum.\n\nFinally, we substitute this result into the formula for the effective mass:\n$$\nm^* = \\hbar^2 \\left( 2ta^2 \\right)^{-1}\n$$\nThis leads to the final expression for the effective mass at the bottom of the band.\n$$\nm^* = \\frac{\\hbar^2}{2ta^2}\n$$\nThis expression is in terms of the hopping parameter $t$, the lattice constant $a$, and the fundamental constant $\\hbar$, as required.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2ta^2}}\n$$", "id": "2866069"}, {"introduction": "Building upon the simple chain, we now introduce a small modification with profound consequences: a staggered on-site potential.
