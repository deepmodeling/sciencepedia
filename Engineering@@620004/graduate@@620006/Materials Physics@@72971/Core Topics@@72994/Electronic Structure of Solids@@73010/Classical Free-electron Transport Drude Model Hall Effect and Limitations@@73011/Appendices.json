In the Drude model, the net force on the electron ensemble is the sum of the electric force and a phenomenological damping force representing scattering events. The equation of motion is:\n$$\n\\frac{d\\mathbf{p}(t)}{dt} = \\mathbf{F}_{\\text{electric}} + \\mathbf{F}_{\\text{damping}}\n$$\nThe electric force on a charge $-e$ is $\\mathbf{F}_{\\text{electric}} = -e\\mathbf{E}(t)$. The damping force, according to the relaxation-time approximation, is proportional to the momentum and acts to restore equilibrium, given by $\\mathbf{F}_{\\text{damping}} = -\\frac{\\mathbf{p}(t)}{\\tau}$. Combining these terms, we have:\n$$\n\\frac{d\\mathbf{p}(t)}{dt} = -e\\mathbf{E}(t) - \\frac{\\mathbf{p}(t)}{\\tau}\n$$\nThe ensemble-averaged momentum is related to the drift velocity $\\mathbf{v}(t)$ by $\\mathbf{p}(t) = m\\mathbf{v}(t)$. Substituting this into the equation of motion and dividing by the effective mass $m$ yields the differential equation for the drift velocity:\n$$\nm\\frac{d\\mathbf{v}(t)}{dt} = -e\\mathbf{E}(t) - \\frac{m\\mathbf{v}(t)}{\\tau} \\implies \\frac{d\\mathbf{v}(t)}{dt} + \\frac{1}{\\tau}\\mathbf{v}(t) = -\\frac{e}{m}\\mathbf{E}(t)\n$$\nThe problem specifies that the electric field is switched on at $t=0$, so $\\mathbf{E}(t) = \\mathbf{E}_{0}\\Theta(t)$. For $t>0$, the equation becomes:\n$$\n\\frac{d\\mathbf{v}(t)}{dt} + \\frac{1}{\\tau}\\mathbf{v}(t) = -\\frac{e\\mathbf{E}_{0}}{m}\n$$\nThis is a first-order linear non-homogeneous ordinary differential equation.

The damping term $-\\mathbf{p}/\\tau$ is negligible. The equation of motion approximates to that of a free particle under a constant force: $m\\frac{d\\mathbf{v}}{dt} \\approx -e\\mathbf{E}_{0}$. Integrating with the initial condition $\\mathbf{v}(0)=\\mathbf{0}$ gives $\\mathbf{v}(t) \\approx -\\frac{e\\mathbf{E}_{0}}{m}t$. This is consistent with the Taylor expansion of the full solution for small $t$: $\\exp(-t/\\tau) \\approx 1 - t/\\tau$, which yields $\\mathbf{v}(t) \\approx -\\frac{e\\tau}{m}\\mathbf{E}_{0}(1 - (1-t/\\tau)) = -\\frac{e\\mathbf{E}_{0}}{m}t$. The velocity increases linearly with time, corresponding to constant acceleration.\n- For $t \\gg \\tau$ (long times), the system reaches a dynamic equilibrium or steady state, where the velocity is constant and thus $\\frac{d\\mathbf{v}}{dt} = \\mathbf{0}$. The equation of motion becomes $\\mathbf{0} + \\frac{1}{\\tau}\\mathbf{v}_{\\text{ss}} = -\\frac{e\\mathbf{E}_{0}}{m}$, which gives the steady-state velocity $\\mathbf{v}_{\\text{ss}} = -\\frac{e\\tau}{m}\\mathbf{E}_{0}$.

A solution will be derived.\n\n### Derivation\nThe objective is to find the intrinsic Hall resistivity, here denoted $\\rho_{xy}(B)$, by correcting for an experimental artifact using symmetry principles.\n\nFirst, we establish the symmetry properties of the resistivity tensor $\\boldsymbol{\\rho}$ with respect to the magnetic field $\\mathbf{B}$. The problem states that the system respects microscopic reversibility. In the presence of a magnetic field, this leads to the Onsager-Casimir reciprocal relations for the resistivity tensor:\n$$\n\\rho_{ij}(\\mathbf{B}) = \\rho_{ji}(-\\mathbf{B})\n$$\n\nApplying this relation to the diagonal and off-diagonal components:\n1.  For the diagonal components ($i=j$), we have $\\rho_{ii}(\\mathbf{B}) = \\rho_{ii}(-\\mathbf{B})$. This means the longitudinal resistivity components are **even** functions of the magnetic field.\n2.  For the off-diagonal components ($i \\neq j$), we have $\\rho_{ij}(\\mathbf{B}) = \\rho_{ji}(-\\mathbf{B})$.\n\nThe total resistivity tensor can be decomposed into parts that are symmetric and antisymmetric with respect to matrix indices: $\\boldsymbol{\\rho} = \\boldsymbol{\\rho}^S + \\boldsymbol{\\rho}^A$, where $\\rho^S_{ij} = (\\rho_{ij} + \\rho_{ji})/2$ and $\\rho^A_{ij} = (\\rho_{ij} - \\rho_{ji})/2$.\n- The diagonal components $\\rho_{ii}$ belong to the symmetric part $\\boldsymbol{\\rho}^S$. They are even functions of $B$.\n- The off-diagonal components can be examined. The intrinsic Hall resistivity is associated with the part of the tensor that is antisymmetric under index exchange and odd under reversal of $\\mathbf{B}$. For an isotropic medium as specified, the tensor takes a simple form. Let us derive it from the given equation of motion in steady state ($d\\mathbf{v}/dt = 0$):\n$$\n0 = -e(\\mathbf{E} + \\mathbf{v} \\times \\mathbf{B}) - \\frac{m}{\\tau}\\mathbf{v}\n$$\nSolving for the electric field $\\mathbf{E}$ in terms of the drift velocity $\\mathbf{v}$:\n$$\n\\mathbf{E} = -(\\mathbf{v} \\times \\mathbf{B}) - \\frac{m}{e\\tau}\\mathbf{v}\n$$\nUsing the definition of current density $\\mathbf{J} = -ne\\mathbf{v}$, we have $\\mathbf{v} = -\\frac{1}{ne}\\mathbf{J}$. Substituting this into the expression for $\\mathbf{E}$:\n$$\n\\mathbf{E} = -\\left(-\\frac{1}{ne}\\mathbf{J} \\times \\mathbf{B}\\right) - \\frac{m}{e\\tau}\\left(-\\frac{1}{ne}\\mathbf{J}\\right) = \\frac{m}{ne^2\\tau}\\mathbf{J} + \\frac{1}{ne}(\\mathbf{J} \\times \\mathbf{B})\n$$\nWith $\\mathbf{J} = (J_x, J_y, 0)$ and $\\mathbf{B} = (0, 0, B)$, the cross product is $\\mathbf{J} \\times \\mathbf{B} = J_y B \\hat{\\mathbf{x}} - J_x B \\hat{\\mathbf{y}}$. The components of the electric field are:\n$$\nE_x = \\frac{m}{ne^2\\tau} J_x + \\frac{B}{ne} J_y\n$$\n$$\nE_y = -\\frac{B}{ne} J_x + \\frac{m}{ne^2\\tau} J_y\n$$\nFrom the relation $\\mathbf{E} = \\boldsymbol{\\rho}\\mathbf{J}$, the components of the resistivity tensor are:\n$$\n\\rho_{xx} = \\rho_{yy} = \\frac{m}{ne^2\\tau}\n$$\n$$\n\\rho_{xy} = \\frac{B}{ne}, \\quad \\rho_{yx} = -\\frac{B}{ne}\n$$\nFrom this explicit result, we see that the longitudinal component $\\rho_{xx}$ is independent of $B$ and thus an **even** function of $B$. The off-diagonal Hall components $\\rho_{xy}$ and $\\rho_{yx}$ are **odd** functions of $B$. This specific result from the simple Drude model is consistent with the general Onsager relations. The longitudinal magnetoresistance, $\\rho_{xx}(B) - \\rho_{xx}(0)$, might not be zero in a more complex model, but $\\rho_{xx}(B)$ must remain an even function of $B$. The Hall resistivity is fundamentally an odd function of $B$.\n\nNow, we model the measured voltage $V_y^{\\mathrm{meas}}$. It consists of two parts: the true Hall voltage $V_H$ and a voltage from the misaligned contacts, $V_{\\text{mis}}$.\n$$\nV_y^{\\mathrm{meas}}(B) = V_H(B) + V_{\\text{mis}}(B)\n$$\n- The Hall voltage arises from the transverse electric field $E_y$. In an ideal Hall bar geometry, current flows only along $x$, so $J_y = 0$. The transverse field is $E_y = \\rho_{yx}(B) J_x$. The voltage across the width $w$ is $V_H(B) = E_y w = \\rho_{yx}(B) J_x w$. With $J_x = I/(wt)$, we get $V_H(B) = \\rho_{yx}(B) \\frac{I}{t}$. The problem asks for $\\rho_{xy}(B)$. Since $\\rho_{xy} = -\\rho_{yx}$ in this isotropic model, both are odd functions of $B$. We define the intrinsic Hall resistivity to be the quantity $\\rho_H(B)$ such that $V_H(B) = \\rho_H(B) \\frac{I}{t}$. Based on our derivation, $\\rho_H(B)$ is an **odd function** of $B$: $V_H(-B) = -V_H(B)$. Let us associate $\\rho_{xy}(B)$ with this quantity.\n- The misalignment voltage $V_{\\text{mis}}$ is a fraction $\\alpha$ of the longitudinal voltage drop over some characteristic distance. The longitudinal field is $E_x(B) = \\rho_{xx}(B) J_x$. Therefore, $V_{\\text{mis}}(B)$ must be proportional to $\\rho_{xx}(B)$. Since $\\rho_{xx}(B)$ is an **even function** of $B$, it follows that $V_{\\text{mis}}(B)$ is also an **even function** of $B$: $V_{\\text{mis}}(-B) = V_{\\text{mis}}(B)$.\n\nWe have established the parity of the two contributions to the measured voltage:\n$$\nV_y^{\\mathrm{meas}}(B) = V_{\\text{odd}}(B) + V_{\\text{even}}(B)\n$$\nwhere $V_H(B) = V_{\\text{odd}}(B)$ and $V_{\\text{mis}}(B) = V_{\\text{even}}(B)$.\n\nTo isolate the odd component, we measure the voltage at opposite magnetic fields, $+B$ and $-B$.\n$$\nV_y^{\\mathrm{meas}}(B) = V_{\\text{odd}}(B) + V_{\\text{even}}(B)\n$$\n$$\nV_y^{\\mathrm{meas}}(-B) = V_{\\text{odd}}(-B) + V_{\\text{even}}(-B) = -V_{\\text{odd}}(B) + V_{\\text{even}}(B)\n$$\nSubtracting the second equation from the first:\n$$\nV_y^{\\mathrm{meas}}(B) - V_y^{\\mathrm{meas}}(-B) = [V_{\\text{odd}}(B) + V_{\\text{even}}(B)] - [-V_{\\text{odd}}(B) + V_{\\text{even}}(B)] = 2V_{\\text{odd}}(B)\n$$\nThus, the intrinsic Hall voltage is given by:\n$$\nV_H(B) = V_{\\text{odd}}(B) = \\frac{V_y^{\\mathrm{meas}}(B) - V_y^{\\mathrm{meas}}(-B)}{2}\n$$\nThe problem asks for the intrinsic Hall resistivity $\\rho_{xy}(B)$. The relationship is $V_H(B) = \\rho_{xy}(B) \\frac{I}{t}$. Substituting our expression for $V_H(B)$:\n$$\n\\rho_{xy}(B) \\frac{I}{t} = \\frac{V_y^{\\mathrm{meas}}(B) - V_y^{\\mathrm{meas}}(-B)}{2}\n$$\nSolving for $\\rho_{xy}(B)$:\n$$\n\\rho_{xy}(B) = \\frac{t}{I} \\frac{V_y^{\\mathrm{meas}}(B) - V_y^{\\mathrm{meas}}(-B)}{2}\n$$\nThis procedure successfully isolates the Hall resistivity by eliminating the contribution from the longitudinal resistance and contact misalignment.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. $\\rho_{xy}(B)=\\dfrac{t}{I}\\,\\dfrac{V_y^{\\mathrm{meas}}(B)+V_y^{\\mathrm{meas}}(-B)}{2}$**\nThe term $\\frac{1}{2}(V_y^{\\mathrm{meas}}(B)+V_y^{\\mathrm{meas}}(-B))$ isolates the even part of the signal, which is $V_{\\text{mis}}(B)$. This expression therefore extracts the voltage contribution from the misalignment, which is related to the longitudinal magnetoresistance $\\rho_{xx}(B)$, not the Hall resistivity. **Incorrect**.\n\n**B. $\\rho_{xy}(B)=\\dfrac{t}{I}\\,\\dfrac{V_y^{\\mathrm{meas}}(B)-V_y^{\\mathrm{meas}}(-B)}{2}$**\nThe term $\\frac{1}{2}(V_y^{\\mathrm{meas}}(B)-V_y^{\\mathrm{meas}}(-B))$ isolates the odd part of the signal, which is the intrinsic Hall voltage $V_H(B)$. Multiplying by $\\frac{t}{I}$ correctly converts this voltage into the Hall resistivity $\\rho_{xy}(B)$. This matches our derivation precisely. **Correct**.\n\n**C. $\\rho_{xy}(B)=\\dfrac{w}{I}\\,\\dfrac{V_y^{\\mathrm{meas}}(B)-V_y^{\\mathrm{meas}}(-B)}{2}$**\nThis expression correctly isolates the Hall voltage in the numerator but uses the incorrect geometric factor. The conversion from Hall voltage to Hall resistivity involves the thickness $t$, not the width $w$, as shown by the relation $V_H = \\rho_{xy} I/t$. **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. $\\rho_{xy}(B)=\\dfrac{t}{I}\\,V_y^{\\mathrm{meas}}(B)$**\nThis formula makes no attempt to correct for the contact misalignment. It assumes $V_y^{\\mathrm{meas}}(B)$ is equal to the intrinsic Hall voltage $V_H(B)$, which is contrary to the problem statement that a longitudinal admixture exists. **Incorrect**.\n\n**E. $\\rho_{xy}(B)=\\dfrac{t}{2 I}\\,\\Big(V_y^{\\mathrm{meas}}(B; +I)-V_y^{\\mathrm{meas}}(B; -I)\\Big)$, where the current is reversed at fixed $B$**\nLet us analyze the effect of reversing the current $I$. Within the Drude model, all fields ($E_x, E_y$) and thus all voltages ($V_H, V_{\\text{mis}}$) are directly proportional to the current density $J_x$, and therefore to $I$. Thus, $V_y^{\\mathrm{meas}}(B; -I) = -V_y^{\\mathrm{meas}}(B; +I)$. The expression becomes:\n$$\n\\frac{t}{2I} [V_y^{\\mathrm{meas}}(B; I) - (-V_y^{\\mathrm{meas}}(B; I))] = \\frac{t}{2I} [2V_y^{\\mathrm{meas}}(B; I)] = \\frac{t}{I}V_y^{\\mathrm{meas}}(B; I)\n$$\nThis is identical to option D and fails to separate the Hall voltage from the misalignment voltage. Reversing the current is a valid technique to eliminate spurious thermoelectric offset voltages which are independent of current direction, but it does not eliminate the resistive misalignment artifact, which reverses sign with the current just like the Hall voltage does. **Incorrect**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2807361"}, {"introduction": "A critical step in scientific modeling is understanding a theory's limitations.

A solution will now be derived.\n\n## Derivation and Analysis\n\n### Part (a): Magnetoresistance in the Simple Drude Model\nThe equation of motion for the average momentum $\\mathbf{p}$ of an electron in the steady state, under the influence of electric and magnetic fields, is given by the relaxation-time approximation:\n$$\n\\frac{d\\mathbf{p}}{dt} = \\mathbf{0} = q(\\mathbf{E} + \\mathbf{v} \\times \\mathbf{B}) - \\frac{\\mathbf{p}}{\\tau}\n$$\nHere, $\\mathbf{p} = m\\mathbf{v}$, $q=-e$, $\\mathbf{E} = (E_x, E_y, E_z)$, and $\\mathbf{B}=(0,0,B)$. The equation for the steady-state velocity $\\mathbf{v}$ is:\n$$\n\\frac{m\\mathbf{v}}{\\tau} + e(\\mathbf{v} \\times \\mathbf{B}) = -e\\mathbf{E}\n$$\nIn component form, this becomes:\n$$\n\\frac{m v_x}{\\tau} - e v_y B = -e E_x \\\\\n\\frac{m v_y}{\\tau} + e v_x B = -e E_y \\\\\n\\frac{m v_z}{\\tau} = -e E_z\n$$\nLet us define the cyclotron frequency $\\omega_c = \\frac{eB}{m}$ and the zero-field conductivity $\\sigma_0 = \\frac{ne^2\\tau}{m}$. The equations can be rewritten as:\n$$\nv_x - \\omega_c \\tau v_y = -\\frac{e\\tau}{m}E_x \\\\\nv_y + \\omega_c \\tau v_x = -\\frac{e\\tau}{m}E_y \\\\\nv_z = -\\frac{e\\tau}{m}E_z\n$$\nSolving the first two equations for $v_x$ and $v_y$ yields:\n$$\nv_x = \\frac{-\\frac{e\\tau}{m}}{1+(\\omega_c\\tau)^2} (E_x + \\omega_c\\tau E_y) \\\\\nv_y = \\frac{-\\frac{e\\tau}{m}}{1+(\\omega_c\\tau)^2} (E_y - \\omega_c\\tau E_x)\n$$\nThe current density is $\\mathbf{J} = nq\\mathbf{v} = -ne\\mathbf{v}$. Substituting the expressions for $\\mathbf{v}$:\n$$\nJ_x = \\frac{ne^2\\tau/m}{1+(\\omega_c\\tau)^2} (E_x + \\omega_c\\tau E_y) = \\frac{\\sigma_0}{1+(\\omega_c\\tau)^2} E_x + \\frac{\\sigma_0\\omega_c\\tau}{1+(\\omega_c\\tau)^2} E_y \\\\\nJ_y = \\frac{ne^2\\tau/m}{1+(\\omega_c\\tau)^2} (E_y - \\omega_c\\tau E_x) = -\\frac{\\sigma_0\\omega_c\\tau}{1+(\\omega_c\\tau)^2} E_x + \\frac{\\sigma_0}{1+(\\omega_c\\tau)^2} E_y \\\\\nJ_z = \\frac{ne^2\\tau}{m} E_z = \\sigma_0 E_z\n$$\nFrom the relation $\\mathbf{J} = \\boldsymbol{\\sigma}\\mathbf{E}$, the conductivity tensor $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}$ is:\n$$\n\\boldsymbol{\\sigma} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\sigma_{xx} & \\sigma_{xy} & 0 \\\\ \\sigma_{yx} & \\sigma_{yy} & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & \\sigma_{zz} \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{\\sigma_0}{1+(\\omega_c\\tau)^2} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & \\omega_c\\tau & 0 \\\\ -\\omega_c\\tau & 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 1+(\\omega_c\\tau)^2 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe resistivity tensor $\\boldsymbol{\\rho}$ is the inverse of the conductivity tensor, $\\boldsymbol{\\rho} = \\boldsymbol{\\sigma}^{-1}$. For the $2 \\times 2$ block in the $xy$-plane, the inverse is:\n$$\n\\boldsymbol{\\rho}_{xy} = \\left( \\frac{\\sigma_0}{1+(\\omega_c\\tau)^2} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & \\omega_c\\tau \\\\ -\\omega_c\\tau & 1 \\end{pmatrix} \\right)^{-1} = \\frac{1+(\\omega_c\\tau)^2}{\\sigma_0} \\frac{1}{1+(\\omega_c\\tau)^2} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & -\\omega_c\\tau \\\\ \\omega_c\\tau & 1 \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{1}{\\sigma_0} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & -\\omega_c\\tau \\\\ \\omega_c\\tau & 1 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe full resistivity tensor is:\n$$\n\\boldsymbol{\\rho} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1/\\sigma_0 & -B/(ne) & 0 \\\\ B/(ne) & 1/\\sigma_0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 1/\\sigma_0 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe longitudinal resistivity component $\\rho_{xx}$ is $\\rho_{xx}(B) = \\frac{1}{\\sigma_0} = \\frac{m}{ne^2\\tau}$.\nAt zero magnetic field ($B=0$), the resistivity is $\\rho_{xx}(0) = \\frac{m}{ne^2\\tau}$.\nIt is clear that $\\rho_{xx}(B) = \\rho_{xx}(0)$ for all values of $B$. Therefore, the transverse magnetoresistance is identically zero:\n$$\n\\frac{\\Delta \\rho_{xx}(B)}{\\rho_{xx}(0)} = \\frac{\\rho_{xx}(B)-\\rho_{xx}(0)}{\\rho_{xx}(0)} = \\frac{1/\\sigma_0 - 1/\\sigma_0}{1/\\sigma_0} = 0\n$$\nThis proves the assertion in part (a).\n\n### Part (b): Analysis of Model Extensions\nWe now evaluate each proposed extension to determine if it is sufficient to produce a non-zero magnetoresistance.\n\n**A. Replace the constant relaxation time by an energy-dependent $\\tau(\\varepsilon)$ in a single isotropic parabolic band at strictly $T=0$.**\nAt absolute zero temperature ($T=0$), the Fermi-Dirac distribution is a step function, and its energy derivative is a Dirac delta function centered at the Fermi energy, $\\varepsilon_F$: $-\\frac{\\partial f_0}{\\partial \\varepsilon} = \\delta(\\varepsilon - \\varepsilon_F)$. The total conductivity is obtained by integrating the energy-dependent conductivity over all energies, weighted by this derivative.\n$$\n\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}_{total} = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\boldsymbol{\\sigma}(\\varepsilon) \\left(-\\frac{\\partial f_0}{\\partial \\varepsilon}\\right) d\\varepsilon = \\boldsymbol{\\sigma}(\\varepsilon_F)\n$$\nThis means that only electrons at the Fermi energy contribute to transport. Consequently, the energy-dependent relaxation time $\\tau(\\varepsilon)$ is effectively replaced by a single constant value, $\\tau(\\varepsilon_F)$. The model reduces to the one analyzed in part (a), which has zero magnetoresistance.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**B. Introduce two types of carriers (for example electrons and holes) with different mobilities, still assuming each band is isotropic and has a single relaxation time.**\nIn a two-band model, the total current density is the sum of the currents from each carrier type, $\\mathbf{J} = \\mathbf{J}_1 + \\mathbf{J}_2$. Therefore, the total conductivity tensor is the sum of the individual conductivity tensors: $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}_{total} = \\boldsymbol{\\sigma}_1 + \\boldsymbol{\\sigma}_2$. Each $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}_i$ has the form derived in part (a), but with its own parameters ($n_i$, $q_i$, $m_i$, $\\tau_i$).\n$$\n\\sigma_{xx,total} = \\frac{\\sigma_{0,1}}{1+(\\omega_{c1}\\tau_1)^2} + \\frac{\\sigma_{0,2}}{1+(\\omega_{c2}\\tau_2)^2} \\\\\n\\sigma_{xy,total} = \\frac{\\sigma_{0,1}(-\\text{sgn}(q_1))\\omega_{c1}\\tau_1}{1+(\\omega_{c1}\\tau_1)^2} + \\frac{\\sigma_{0,2}(-\\text{sgn}(q_2))\\omega_{c2}\\tau_2}{1+(\\omega_{c2}\\tau_2)^2}\n$$\nThe longitudinal resistivity is found by inverting the total conductivity tensor: $\\rho_{xx} = \\frac{\\sigma_{xx}}{\\sigma_{xx}^2 + \\sigma_{xy}^2}$. Substituting the summed components, the expression for $\\rho_{xx}(B)$ is complex and no longer simplifies to a constant. The perfect cancellation that occurred for a single carrier type is broken because the ratio $\\sigma_{xy,i}/\\sigma_{xx,i}$ is different for the two carriers. Thus, $\\rho_{xx}(B)$ will depend on the magnetic field $B$.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**C. Keep a single band and a single, scalar relaxation time, but allow the band to be anisotropic (for example, an ellipsoidal effective-mass tensor) while maintaining spatial homogeneity.**\nAnisotropy in the band structure means the effective mass $m$ is a tensor, $\\mathbf{M}$. The velocity $\\mathbf{v}$ and momentum $\\mathbf{p} = \\mathbf{Mv}$ are generally not parallel. The Lorentz force $q(\\mathbf{v} \\times \\mathbf{B})$ acts on the velocity, leading to a more complex dynamic than in the isotropic case. A complete analysis using the Boltzmann transport equation shows that band anisotropy is a fundamental source of magnetoresistance. For certain orientations of the magnetic field, anisotropic Fermi surfaces can give rise to \"open orbits\" in k-space, where electron trajectories are not closed loops. This leads to a non-saturating magnetoresistance, often proportional to $B^2$. Even for closed orbits, if the field is not aligned with a high-symmetry axis of the Fermi surface, a magnetoresistance will appear. The simplified Newtonian model from part (a), when naively extended, may fail to capture this physics, but within the proper semiclassical framework, this extension is sufficient.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**D. Keep a single isotropic parabolic band, but allow the relaxation time to depend on the direction on the Fermi surface, $\\tau=\\tau(\\theta,\\phi)$, while remaining energy independent near the Fermi level.**\nIf $\\tau$ is anisotropic, i.e., $\\tau=\\tau(\\mathbf{k})$, electrons at different points on the Fermi surface have different scattering times. To find the total conductivity, one must average the contributions from all electrons on the Fermi surface. This is equivalent to having a continuous distribution of carrier groups, each with a different relaxation time. Similar to the two-band model (B), this summation/integration over a distribution of parameters breaks the exact cancellation that leads to zero magnetoresistance. The system behaves as if it has multiple carrier types, and a non-zero magnetoresistance is generated.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**E. Keep a single isotropic parabolic band and a single relaxation time, but allow the magnetic field to be arbitrarily strong (still within the classical regime), fully retaining the Lorentz force in the steady-state dynamics.**\nThe derivation in part (a) was performed without any approximation on the magnitude of the magnetic field $B$. The Lorentz force term $q(\\mathbf{v} \\times \\mathbf{B})$ was fully included. The resulting expression for the conductivity tensor $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}(B)$ and resistivity tensor $\\boldsymbol{\\rho}(B)$ are exact for all $B$ within the assumptions of the model. The conclusion that $\\rho_{xx}$ is independent of $B$ is a direct consequence of the model's structure, not a low-field or high-field approximation. Increasing the field strength does not change this result.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{BCD}$$", "id": "2807391"}]}
