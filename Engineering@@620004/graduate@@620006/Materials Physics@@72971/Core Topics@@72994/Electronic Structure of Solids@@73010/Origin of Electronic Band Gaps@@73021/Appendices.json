It is a canonical problem in introductory solid-state physics for demonstrating the origin of electronic band gaps using the nearly-free electron model and perturbation theory. All necessary parameters and conditions are provided for a unique solution. We will therefore proceed with a full derivation.\n\nThe problem requires us to find the width of the first energy gap for a one-dimensional electron of mass $m$ in a periodic potential given by a Dirac comb:\n$$V(x) = P \\sum_{n \\in \\mathbb{Z}} \\delta(x - n a)$$\nwhere $P$ is the barrier strength and $a$ is the lattice constant. The method to be used is first-order degenerate perturbation theory within the nearly-free electron approximation.\n\nIn the nearly-free electron model, we start by considering the electron to be free, with the periodic potential $V(x)$ treated as a small perturbation. The unperturbed time-independent Schrödinger equation is:\n$$-\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2m} \\frac{d^2\\psi^{(0)}(x)}{dx^2} = E^{(0)} \\psi^{(0)}(x)$$\nThe solutions are plane waves, $\\psi_k^{(0)}(x) = A e^{ikx}$, normalized over a length $L$. The corresponding unperturbed energy eigenvalues are parabolic:\n$$E_k^{(0)} = \\frac{\\hbar^2 k^2}{2m}$$\n\nThe periodic potential $V(x)$ has the periodicity of the lattice, $V(x+a) = V(x)$. Such a potential mixes plane wave states $|\\psi_k^{(0)}\\rangle$ and $|\\psi_{k'}^{(0)}\\rangle$ if their wavevectors are related by a reciprocal lattice vector, $k - k' = G$, where $G = j \\frac{2\\pi}{a}$ for any integer $j \\in \\mathbb{Z}$.\n\nEnergy gaps arise at the boundaries of the Brillouin zones, where the condition for Bragg reflection, $k = G/2$, is met. At these points, the state $|\\psi_k^{(0)}\\rangle$ is degenerate in energy with the state $|\\psi_{-k}^{(0)}\\rangle = |\\psi_{k-G}^{(0)}\\rangle$. The first Brillouin zone boundary occurs at $k = \\pm \\frac{\\pi}{a}$, which corresponds to $G = \\frac{2\\pi}{a}$. At $k = \\frac{\\pi}{a}$, the unperturbed energy is:\n$$E_{\\pi/a}^{(0)} = \\frac{\\hbar^2}{2m} \\left(\\frac{\\pi}{a}\\right)^2$$\nThe state $|\\psi_{-\\pi/a}^{(0)}\\rangle$ is degenerate with $|\\psi_{\\pi/a}^{(0)}\\rangle$ since $E_{-\\pi/a}^{(0)} = \\frac{\\hbar^2}{2m} \\left(-\\frac{\\pi}{a}\\right)^2 = E_{\\pi/a}^{(0)}$. These two states are coupled by the potential because their wavevectors differ by a reciprocal lattice vector: $\\frac{\\pi}{a} - (-\\frac{\\pi}{a}) = \\frac{2\\pi}{a} = G_1$.\n\nWe must apply degenerate perturbation theory to this two-state system. In the nearly-free electron framework, this is equivalent to solving the secular equation for the energy eigenvalues $E$ near the degeneracy:\n$$ \\begin{vmatrix} E_{\\pi/a}^{(0)} - E & V_{G_1} \\\\ V_{-G_1} & E_{-\\pi/a}^{(0)} - E \\end{vmatrix} = 0 $$\nwhere $V_G$ are the Fourier coefficients of the potential, $V(x) = \\sum_G V_G e^{iGx}$. Since $E_{\\pi/a}^{(0)} = E_{-\\pi/a}^{(0)} = E^{(0)}$, the equation simplifies to:\n$$ (E^{(0)} - E)^2 - V_{G_1} V_{-G_1} = 0 $$\nFor a real potential $V(x)$, we have $V_{-G} = V_G^*$, so the second term is $|V_{G_1}|^2$. The solutions for the energy are:\n$$ E = E^{(0)} \\pm |V_{G_1}| $$\nThe degenerate energy level $E^{(0)}$ is split into two new levels, $E_+$ and $E_-$. The energy gap, $E_g$, is the difference between these two levels:\n$$ E_g = E_+ - E_- = (E^{(0)} + |V_{G_1}|) - (E^{(0)} - |V_{G_1}|) = 2|V_{G_1}| $$\nTo find the gap, we must calculate the Fourier coefficient $V_{G_1}$ for $G_1 = \\frac{2\\pi}{a}$. The general form for the Fourier coefficients is:\n$$ V_G = \\frac{1}{a} \\int_{-a/2}^{a/2} V(x) e^{-iGx} dx $$\nSubstituting the potential for a single unit cell, $V(x) = P \\delta(x)$ for $x \\in [-a/2, a/2]$:\n$$ V_G = \\frac{1}{a} \\int_{-a/2}^{a/2} P \\delta(x) e^{-iGx} dx $$\nUsing the sifting property of the Dirac delta function, we find:\n$$ V_G = \\frac{P}{a} e^{-iG \\cdot 0} = \\frac{P}{a} $$\nThe Fourier coefficient is constant for all reciprocal lattice vectors $G$. Since $P$ and $a$ are positive physical quantities, $|V_G| = \\frac{P}{a}$.\n\nTherefore, the width of the first energy gap, which occurs at the boundary of the first Brillouin zone, is:\n$$ E_g = 2|V_{2\\pi/a}| = 2 \\frac{P}{a} $$\nThis result shows that the gap width is directly proportional to the barrier strength $P$ and inversely proportional to the lattice constant $a$. This is the required analytical dependence.\n\nFinally, we are asked to evaluate this gap width numerically for the given parameters: $P = 1.23 \\ \\mathrm{eV \\cdot \\AA}$ and $a = 3.45 \\ \\mathrm{\\AA}$.\nSubstituting these values into our derived expression:\n$$ E_g = \\frac{2 \\times (1.23 \\ \\mathrm{eV \\cdot \\AA})}{3.45 \\ \\mathrm{\\AA}} = \\frac{2.46}{3.45} \\ \\mathrm{eV} $$\nPerforming the division:\n$$ E_g \\approx 0.713043478... \\ \\mathrm{eV} $$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to $4$ significant figures.\n$$ E_g \\approx 0.7130 \\ \\mathrm{eV} $$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.7130}$$", "id": "2845352"}, {"introduction": "While the nearly-free electron model is intuitive, the tight-binding approximation provides a complementary and often more practical picture, starting from localized atomic orbitals.

For simplicity, we drop the explicit dependence on $k$ for the coefficients, writing them as $c_A$ and $c_B$.\n\nWe substitute this ansatz into the Schrödinger equation.

For $\\delta \\ne 0$, a gap opens.\n\nFor the second part, we must find the direct band gap $E_g$, defined as the minimum energy separation between the bands:\n$$\nE_g = \\min_{k \\in \\text{BZ}} \\Big( E_{+}(k) - E_{-}(k) \\Big)\n$$\nThe energy separation is $\\Delta E(k) = E_{+}(k) - E_{-}(k) = 4t\\sqrt{\\cos^2(ka) + \\delta^2\\sin^2(ka)}$.\nTo find the minimum of $\\Delta E(k)$, we must find the minimum of the function under the square root, $f(k) = \\cos^2(ka) + \\delta^2\\sin^2(ka)$, over the first Brillouin zone $k \\in [-\\pi/(2a), \\pi/(2a)]$.\nWe can rewrite $f(k)$ as:\n$$\nf(k) = (1-\\sin^2(ka)) + \\delta^2\\sin^2(ka) = 1 - (1-\\delta^2)\\sin^2(ka)\n$$\nSince it is given that $|\\delta|<1$, the term $1-\\delta^2$ is positive. To minimize $f(k)$, we must maximize $\\sin^2(ka)$.\nWithin the first Brillouin zone $k \\in [-\\pi/(2a), \\pi/(2a)]$, the argument $ka$ ranges from $-\\pi/2$ to $\\pi/2$. The term $\\sin^2(ka)$ is maximized at the boundaries of this interval, i.e., at $ka = \\pm\\pi/2$, which corresponds to $k = \\pm\\pi/(2a)$. At these points, $\\sin^2(\\pm\\pi/2)=1$.\nThe minimum value of $f(k)$ is therefore:\n$$\nf_{min} = f(\\pm\\pi/(2a)) = 1 - (1-\\delta^2)(1) = \\delta^2\n$$\nSubstituting this back into the expression for the energy separation gives the band gap $E_g$:\n$$\nE_g = 4t\\sqrt{f_{min}} = 4t\\sqrt{\\delta^2} = 4t|\\delta|\n$$\nThe gap is directly proportional to the magnitude of the dimerization parameter $\\delta$.\nThe final expressions for the energy bands and the direct band gap are:\n$E_{+}(k) = 2t \\sqrt{\\cos^2(ka) + \\delta^2\\sin^2(ka)}$\n$E_{-}(k) = -2t \\sqrt{\\cos^2(ka) + \\delta^2\\sin^2(ka)}$\n$E_g = 4t|\\delta|$", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{align*}\nE_{+}(k) &= 2t \\sqrt{\\cos^2(ka) + \\delta^2\\sin^2(ka)} \\\\\nE_{-}(k) &= -2t \\sqrt{\\cos^2(ka) + \\delta^2\\sin^2(ka)} \\\\\nE_{g} &= 4t|\\delta|\n\\end{align*}\n}\n$$", "id": "2845336"}]}
