The Schrödinger equation is a fundamental principle of quantum mechanics. The limits are standard idealizations used to understand the model's behavior. The problem is scientifically sound.\n- **Well-Posedness**: The problem is well-posed.

It is a valid, well-posed problem of theoretical physics. I will proceed to the solution.\n\n**Derivation and Analysis**\n\nThe analysis will proceed by examining each limit separately and deducing the corresponding physical model from first principles.\n\n**1. Limit: $b \\to 0$ with $V_0 b$ held fixed and finite**\n\nLet the fixed product be $S = V_0 b$. As the barrier width $b$ approaches zero, the barrier height $V_0 = S/b$ must approach infinity for $S$ to remain finite and non-zero.\nThe potential $V(x)$ consists of a periodic array of rectangular barriers. Let's consider the barrier in the first unit cell, located over the interval $(0, b)$. The effect of a potential barrier on a wavefunction is related to its integral. The integral of the potential over one barrier is:\n$$\n\\int_0^b V(x) dx = \\int_0^b V_0 dx = V_0 b = S\n$$\nIn the limit as $b \\to 0$, we have a potential that is non-zero only over an infinitesimally small region, yet its integral is a finite constant $S$. A function with these properties—zero everywhere except at a single point where it is infinite, and having a finite integral—is the definition of the Dirac delta function, $\\delta(x)$.\nSpecifically, a rectangular barrier of height $V_0$ and width $b$ centered at $x_0$ becomes $S \\delta(x-x_0)$ in the limit $b \\to 0, V_0 \\to \\infty$ with $V_0b = S$.\nThe problem describes a periodic potential $V(x) = \\sum_{n=-\\infty}^{\\infty} V_n(x-na)$, where $V_n(x-na)$ is the potential barrier in the $n$-th cell. In this limit, each rectangular barrier becomes a delta function. The resulting potential is a periodic sum of delta functions:\n$$\nV(x) = S \\sum_{n=-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\delta(x-na)\n$$\nThis is precisely the potential for the **delta-barrier (Dirac comb)** model.\n\n**2. Limit: $V_0 \\to 0$ at fixed $a$ and $b$**\n\nThe potential is defined as $V(x) = V_0$ in the barrier regions and $V(x) = 0$ in the well regions. If the barrier height $V_0$ is taken to zero, the potential becomes zero everywhere:\n$$\n\\lim_{V_0 \\to 0} V(x) = 0 \\quad \\text{for all } x.\n$$\nThe time-independent Schrödinger equation simplifies to:\n$$\n-\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2m}\\frac{d^2 \\psi}{dx^2} = E \\psi(x)\n$$\nThis is the Schrödinger equation for a free particle, whose solutions are plane waves $\\psi(x) = A e^{\\pm i k x}$ with the energy-momentum dispersion relation $E = \\frac{\\hbar^2 k^2}{2m}$. This corresponds to the **free-electron (no potential)** limit.\n\n**3. Limit: $b \\to a$ at fixed $a$ and $V_0$**\n\nThe unit cell of period $a$ consists of a barrier of width $b$ and a well of width $w = a-b$. In the limit $b \\to a$, the width of the potential wells, $w = a-b$, approaches zero. The potential barriers separating these wells have a width $b$ that approaches the full lattice period $a$.\nThe formation of energy bands in a periodic potential is a direct consequence of quantum tunneling of electrons between adjacent potential wells. The probability of an electron with energy $E < V_0$ tunneling through a rectangular barrier of height $V_0$ and width $b$ is approximately proportional to an exponential decay factor, $T \\propto e^{-2\\kappa b}$, where $\\kappa = \\frac{\\sqrt{2m(V_0 - E)}}{\\hbar}$.\nAs $b \\to a$, the barrier width $b$ increases to its maximum possible value for a fixed period $a$. Consequently, the tunneling probability $T$ decreases exponentially. In this limit, tunneling becomes negligible. When tunneling between wells is suppressed, the wells become effectively decoupled or isolated from one another. The Bloch states, which represent propagating waves throughout the crystal, can no longer exist. The continuous energy bands collapse into the discrete, degenerate energy levels of a single, isolated potential well.\nThe problem statement itself provides the interpretation: \"isolated-well (negligible inter-well tunneling) limit\". The physical mechanism for achieving this is the suppression of tunneling, which is directly caused by increasing the barrier width $b$. Therefore, the limit $b \\to a$ produces the **isolated-well** regime.\n\n**Evaluation of Options**\n\nBased on the derivations above:\n- Limit 1 ($b \\to 0$, $V_0 b$ fixed) corresponds to the **delta-barrier comb**.\n- Limit 2 ($V_0 \\to 0$) corresponds to the **free-electron limit**.\n- Limit 3 ($b \\to a$) corresponds to the **isolated-well limit**.\n\nNow, I will evaluate each option:\n\n**A. $b \\to 0$ with $V_0 b$ fixed $\\Rightarrow$ delta-barrier comb; $V_0 \\to 0$ $\\Rightarrow$ free electrons; $b \\to a$ $\\Rightarrow$ isolated wells.**\n- First pair: Correct.

The limit $b \\to 0$ with $V_0 b$ fixed yields the delta-barrier comb, not free electrons.\n- Second pair: Incorrect. The limit $V_0 \\to 0$ yields free electrons, not the delta-barrier comb.\nThis option is **Incorrect**.\n\n**C. $b \\to 0$ with $V_0 b$ fixed $\\Rightarrow$ delta-barrier comb; $V_0 \\to 0$ $\\Rightarrow$ isolated wells; $b \\to a$ $\\Rightarrow$ free electrons.**\n- Second pair: Incorrect.

It is a standard problem in condensed matter physics, representing the Kronig-Penney model with a Dirac comb potential. Therefore, the problem is valid, and a solution will be provided.\n\nThe solution is divided into three parts as requested by the problem statement.\n\n**1) Derivation of the dispersion relation**\n\nWe begin with the time-independent Schrödinger equation for an electron of effective mass $m$ in the potential $V(x) = P \\sum_{n\\in\\mathbb{Z}} \\delta(x - n a)$:\n$$\n-\\frac{\\hbar^{2}}{2 m}\\,\\frac{d^{2}\\psi}{dx^{2}} + V(x)\\,\\psi(x) = E\\,\\psi(x)\n$$\nIn the region between the delta potentials, for example $0 < x < a$, the potential $V(x)=0$. The Schrödinger equation simplifies to:\n$$\n\\frac{d^{2}\\psi}{dx^{2}} = -\\frac{2mE}{\\hbar^2}\\psi(x)\n$$\nLet us define a wave number $k$ such that $k^2 = 2mE/\\hbar^2$. For $E>0$, $k$ is real. For $E<0$, $k$ is imaginary, and it is convenient to write $k=i\\kappa$ where $\\kappa = \\sqrt{-2mE}/\\hbar$ is real and positive. The general solution in the region $0 < x < a$ can be written as:\n$$\n\\psi(x) = A \\cos(kx) + B \\sin(kx)\n$$\nIts derivative is:\n$$\n\\psi'(x) = -Ak \\sin(kx) + Bk \\cos(kx)\n$$\nWe apply boundary conditions. The wavefunction $\\psi(x)$ must be continuous everywhere.\nAt $x=0$, the function is continuous, so $\\psi(0^+) = \\psi(0^-) = \\psi(0)$. From our solution form, $\\psi(0^+) = A$. Thus, $\\psi(0) = A$.\n\nThe derivative $\\psi'(x)$ has a discontinuity at each delta function. The given jump condition at $x=0$ is:\n$$\n\\psi'(0^{+}) - \\psi'(0^{-}) = \\frac{2 m P}{\\hbar^{2}}\\,\\psi(0)\n$$\nWe have $\\psi'(0^+) = Bk$. Substituting $\\psi(0)=A$, the jump condition becomes:\n$$\nBk - \\psi'(0^{-}) = \\frac{2 m P}{\\hbar^{2}} A\n$$\nTo find $\\psi(0^-)$ and $\\psi'(0^-)$, we use Bloch's theorem, $\\psi(x+a) = \\exp(iqa)\\psi(x)$. This implies $\\psi(x) = \\exp(-iqa)\\psi(x+a)$.\nFor a point just to the left of $x=0$, i.e., $x \\to 0^-$, the corresponding point in the next cell is $x+a \\to a^-$.\nThus, continuity and Bloch's theorem give:\n$$\n\\psi(0) = \\psi(0^-) = \\psi(a^-) \\exp(-iqa)\n$$\n$$\nA = [A \\cos(ka) + B \\sin(ka)] \\exp(-iqa) \\quad (1)\n$$\nSimilarly, for the derivative:\n$$\n\\psi'(0^-) = \\psi'(a^-) \\exp(-iqa)\n$$\n$$\n\\psi'(0^-) = [-Ak \\sin(ka) + Bk \\cos(ka)] \\exp(-iqa)\n$$\nSubstituting this into the jump condition equation:\n$$\nBk - [-Ak \\sin(ka) + Bk \\cos(ka)] \\exp(-iqa) = \\frac{2 m P}{\\hbar^{2}} A \\quad (2)\n$$\nEquations (1) and (2) form a system of two linear homogeneous equations for the coefficients $A$ and $B$. For a non-trivial solution ($A, B$ not both zero), the determinant of the coefficient matrix must be zero. This leads to the general dispersion relation:\n$$\n\\cos(qa) = \\cos(ka) + \\frac{mP}{\\hbar^2 k} \\sin(ka)\n$$\nThis relation connects the crystal momentum $q$ with the energy $E$ through $k = \\sqrt{2mE}/\\hbar$.\n\n**2) Analysis of negative-energy solutions**\n\nFor negative energies, $E < 0$, we set $E = -\\hbar^2\\kappa^2/(2m)$ with $\\kappa>0$. The wave number becomes imaginary, $k=i\\kappa$. We substitute this into the dispersion relation using $\\cos(i\\kappa a) = \\cosh(\\kappa a)$ and $\\sin(i\\kappa a) = i\\sinh(\\kappa a)$:\n$$\n\\cos(qa) = \\cosh(\\kappa a) + \\frac{mP}{\\hbar^2(i\\kappa)} [i\\sinh(\\kappa a)] = \\cosh(\\kappa a) + \\frac{mP}{\\hbar^2\\kappa}\\sinh(\\kappa a)\n$$\nFor an energy $E$ (or corresponding $\\kappa$) to be in an allowed band, the crystal momentum $q$ must be real. This requires $|\\cos(qa)| \\le 1$. Let $F(\\kappa) = \\cosh(\\kappa a) + \\frac{mP}{\\hbar^2\\kappa}\\sinh(\\kappa a)$. We need $-1 \\le F(\\kappa) \\le 1$.\n\nCase for repulsive coupling, $P > 0$:\nSince $m, a, \\hbar$ are positive, and we are considering $\\kappa>0$, all terms in $F(\\kappa)$ are positive. Specifically, $\\cosh(\\kappa a) > 1$ for $\\kappa a > 0$, and $\\frac{mP}{\\hbar^2\\kappa}\\sinh(\\kappa a) > 0$.\nTherefore, for any $\\kappa>0$, $F(\\kappa) > 1$. The condition $|\\cos(qa)| \\le 1$ can never be satisfied. Thus, for $P>0$, there are no allowed bands with $E<0$.\n\nCase for attractive coupling, $P < 0$:\nLet $P = -|P|$. The condition becomes $-1 \\le \\cosh(\\kappa a) - \\frac{m|P|}{\\hbar^2\\kappa}\\sinh(\\kappa a) \\le 1$.\nTo show that a band exists, consider the energy of a single bound state for an isolated attractive delta potential, $V(x) = -|P|\\delta(x)$, which is $E_{bs} = -m|P|^2/(2\\hbar^2)$. This corresponds to a decay constant $\\kappa_{bs} = \\sqrt{-2mE_{bs}}/\\hbar = m|P|/\\hbar^2$.\nLet us evaluate our periodic system's function $F(\\kappa)$ at this specific value $\\kappa = \\kappa_{bs}$:\n$$\nF(\\kappa_{bs}) = \\cosh(\\kappa_{bs}a) - \\frac{m|P|}{\\hbar^2\\kappa_{bs}}\\sinh(\\kappa_{bs}a) = \\cosh\\left(\\frac{m|P|a}{\\hbar^2}\\right) - \\sinh\\left(\\frac{m|P|a}{\\hbar^2}\\right)\n$$\nUsing the identity $\\cosh(x)-\\sinh(x) = \\exp(-x)$, we get:\n$$\nF(\\kappa_{bs}) = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{m|P|a}{\\hbar^2}\\right)\n$$\nSince $m, |P|, a, \\hbar^2$ are all positive, the exponent is negative, which implies $0 < \\exp(-m|P|a/\\hbar^2) < 1$.\nSo, we have found a specific energy for which $\\cos(qa) = F(\\kappa_{bs})$ is between $0$ and $1$. This is a physically allowed state with real $q$. Since the allowed energies form continuous bands, this proves that for any attractive coupling $P < 0$, there exists an allowed band with $E<0$.\n\n**3) Determination of the critical value $P_c$**\n\nThe \"lowest band\" corresponds to the negative energy states. We want to find the critical potential strength $P_c$ such that for $P<P_c$, this entire band lies below $E=0$. This means the top of the band, $E_{top}$, must be less than or equal to $0$. The critical condition occurs when $E_{top}=0$.\n\nThe band edges are defined by $\\cos(qa)=\\pm 1$. The top of the lowest band (highest energy, smallest $\\kappa$) occurs at the Brillouin zone edge $q=\\pi/a$, where $\\cos(qa)=-1$.\nThe equation for this band edge is:\n$$ \\cosh(\\kappa a) - \\frac{m|P|}{\\hbar^2\\kappa}\\sinh(\\kappa a) = -1 $$\nThe band top touches $E=0$ when $\\kappa=0$. We analyze the equation in the limit $\\kappa \\to 0$. Using Taylor expansions $\\cosh(x) \\approx 1+x^2/2$ and $\\sinh(x) \\approx x+x^3/6$:\n$$ \\left(1+\\frac{(\\kappa a)^2}{2}\\right) - \\frac{m|P|}{\\hbar^2\\kappa}\\left(\\kappa a + \\frac{(\\kappa a)^3}{6}\\right) \\approx -1 $$\n$$ 1+\\frac{\\kappa^2 a^2}{2} - \\frac{m|P|a}{\\hbar^2}\\left(1 + \\frac{\\kappa^2 a^2}{6}\\right) \\approx -1 $$\nIn the limit $\\kappa \\to 0$, this becomes $1 - \\frac{m|P|a}{\\hbar^2} = -1$, which gives the critical condition for $|P_c|$:\n$$ \\frac{m|P_c|a}{\\hbar^2} = 2 \\implies |P_c| = \\frac{2\\hbar^2}{ma} $$\nSince we are in the attractive regime ($P<0$), the critical potential is:\n$$\nP_c = -\\frac{2\\hbar^2}{ma}\n$$\nFor $P < P_c$, we have $|P| > |P_c|$, which ensures that the top of the band lies strictly below $E=0$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{-\\frac{2\\hbar^2}{ma}}\n$$", "id": "2834230"}, {"introduction": "Real crystals often have more than one atom in their primitive unit cell, leading to more complex band structures.
