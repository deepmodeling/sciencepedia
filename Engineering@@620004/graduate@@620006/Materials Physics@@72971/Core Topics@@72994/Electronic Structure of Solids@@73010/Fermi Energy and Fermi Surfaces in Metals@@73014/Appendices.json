It is a fundamental, well-posed problem in condensed matter physics that is scientifically grounded and internally consistent. We proceed with the derivation.\n\nThe system is a gas of $N$ non-interacting electrons confined to a three-dimensional cubic volume $V = L^3$, where $L$ is the side length of the cube. We impose periodic boundary conditions on the single-particle wavefunctions, $\\psi(\\mathbf{r})$. A single-particle state is described by a plane wave, $\\psi_{\\mathbf{k}}(\\mathbf{r}) = C \\exp(i\\mathbf{k} \\cdot \\mathbf{r})$, where $\\mathbf{k}$ is the wavevector.\n\nThe periodic boundary condition requires that the wavefunction is periodic with period $L$ along each Cartesian axis. For the $x$-direction, this is $\\psi(x+L, y, z) = \\psi(x, y, z)$. This implies $\\exp(ik_x(x+L)) = \\exp(ik_x x)$, which simplifies to $\\exp(ik_x L) = 1$.

Therefore, the total number of electrons, $N$, is twice the number of occupied orbital states:\n$$N = g_s \\times N_{\\text{orbitals}} = 2 \\times \\left(\\frac{V k_F^3}{6\\pi^2}\\right) = \\frac{V k_F^3}{3\\pi^2}$$\n\nThe problem requires an expression in terms of the electron number density, $n = N/V$.
