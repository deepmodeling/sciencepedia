We begin from first principles, considering the quantization of the wavevector $\\mathbf{k}$ imposed by periodic boundary conditions on a cubic crystal of side length $L$.\n\nFor a wavefunction $\\psi(\\mathbf{r})$ to be periodic over the dimensions of the cube, we must have $\\psi(x+L, y, z) = \\psi(x, y, z)$, and similarly for the $y$ and $z$ directions.

These allowed $\\mathbf{k}$ values form a simple cubic lattice in $\\mathbf{k}$-space.

This gives $\\varepsilon_F - E_c = n/D_{0} = \\frac{2\\pi\\hbar^2 n}{g_s g_v m^\\ast}$.\nWe can rewrite the argument of the exponential in the expression for $\\mu(T)$ as $\\frac{n/D_0}{k_B T} = \\frac{\\varepsilon_F - E_c}{k_B T}$.\n$$ \\mu(T) = E_{c} + k_{B} T \\ln\\left(\\exp\\left(\\frac{\\varepsilon_{F} - E_{c}}{k_{B} T}\\right) - 1\\right) $$\nFor low temperatures, $k_{B} T \\ll \\varepsilon_{F}-E_{c}$, which implies $\\exp\\left(\\frac{\\varepsilon_{F} - E_{c}}{k_{B} T}\\right) \\gg 1$.\nWe use the approximation $\\ln(e^{x}-1) = \\ln(e^{x}(1-e^{-x})) = x + \\ln(1-e^{-x}) \\approx x - e^{-x}$ for large $x$.\nApplying this to our expression with $x = (\\varepsilon_F - E_c)/(k_B T)$:\n$$ \\mu(T) \\approx E_{c} + k_{B} T \\left[ \\frac{\\varepsilon_{F}-E_{c}}{k_{B} T} - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\varepsilon_{F}-E_{c}}{k_{B} T}\\right) \\right] $$\n$$ \\mu(T) \\approx E_{c} + (\\varepsilon_{F}-E_{c}) - k_{B} T \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\varepsilon_{F}-E_{c}}{k_{B} T}\\right) $$\n$$ \\mu(T) \\approx \\varepsilon_{F} - k_{B} T \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\varepsilon_{F}-E_{c}}{k_{B} T}\\right) $$\nThe leading temperature correction in $2$D is thus exponentially small, specifically it has a dependence of the form $-T\\exp(-C/T)$, where $C$ is a positive constant.\n\nComparison and explanation:\nThe temperature dependence of the chemical potential is drastically different in 2D and 3D.\n- In 3D, $\\mu(T)$ decreases with a $T^{2}$ power law from its $T=0$ value.\n- In 2D, $\\mu(T)$ decreases exponentially towards its $T=0$ value. This means $\\mu(T)$ is much flatter and closer to $\\varepsilon_F$ at low temperatures in 2D.\n\nThis qualitative difference arises directly from the energy dependence of the density of states. In 3D, $D_{3\\mathrm{D}}(\\varepsilon)$ increases with energy ($\\propto \\sqrt{\\varepsilon-E_c}$). As temperature increases, the Fermi-Dirac distribution smears. Electrons are excited to states above $\\mu$, where the density of states is higher, and simultaneously leave states below $\\mu$, where the DOS is lower. To maintain a constant number of particles, $\\mu$ must shift downwards to a region of lower average DOS to compensate. This shift scales as $T^{2}$.\nIn contrast, in 2D, the density of states $D_{2\\mathrm{D}}(\\varepsilon)$ is constant for $\\varepsilon \\ge E_c$. When the FD distribution smears with temperature, the number of states available for thermally excited electrons above $\\mu$ is the same as the number of states from which electrons are removed below $\\mu$. This symmetry leads to a near-perfect cancellation. The only reason $\\mu$ shifts at all is due to the hard cutoff of the DOS at $E_c$, which breaks the perfect symmetry of the integration domain around $\\mu$. The resulting correction is exponentially small, reflecting how insignificant this edge effect is at low temperatures where $\\mu \\gg E_c$.", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{E_{c} + k_{B} T \\ln\\left(\\exp\\left(\\frac{2\\pi \\hbar^{2} n}{g_{s} g_{v} m^{\\ast} k_{B} T}\\right) - 1\\right)} $$", "id": "2822535"}, {"introduction": "Our final practice demonstrates the dramatic restructuring of the electronic spectrum in the presence of an external magnetic field.

The Hamiltonian is given by minimal coupling:\n$$H = \\frac{1}{2m^{\\ast}}(\\mathbf{p} - q\\mathbf{A})^2 = \\frac{1}{2m^{\\ast}}(\\mathbf{p} + e\\mathbf{A})^2$$\nwhere $\\mathbf{p} = -i\\hbar\\nabla$ is the canonical momentum operator. The magnetic field is uniform, $\\mathbf{B} = B\\,\\hat{\\mathbf{z}}$, and we employ the Landau gauge, $\\mathbf{A} = (0, Bx, 0)$. Substituting the components of $\\mathbf{p}$ and $\\mathbf{A}$ into the Hamiltonian, we obtain:\n$$H = \\frac{1}{2m^{\\ast}}\\left[ (p_x + eA_x)^2 + (p_y + eA_y)^2 + (p_z + eA_z)^2 \\right]$$\nFor a $2$D system in the $xy$-plane, $p_z=0$. With our gauge choice, $A_x=0$, $A_y=Bx$, and $A_z=0$. The Hamiltonian simplifies to:\n$$H = \\frac{1}{2m^{\\ast}}\\left[p_x^2 + (p_y + eBx)^2\\right]$$\nSince the Hamiltonian is independent of the $y$ coordinate, $[H, p_y]=0$, which means $p_y$ is a conserved quantity. Its eigenstates are plane waves in the $y$-direction. We can therefore seek a separable solution to the time-independent Schrödinger equation $H\\psi(x,y) = E\\psi(x,y)$ of the form:\n$$\\psi(x,y) = e^{ik_y y}\\phi(x)$$\nSubstituting this ansatz into the Schrödinger equation, and noting that $p_y$ acts as the number $\\hbar k_y$ on this wavefunction, we get an equation for $\\phi(x)$:\n$$\\frac{1}{2m^{\\ast}}\\left[ p_x^2 + (\\hbar k_y + eBx)^2 \\right]\\phi(x) = E\\phi(x)$$\nLet us analyze the potential energy term. We can rewrite it as:\n$$V(x) = \\frac{(\\hbar k_y + eBx)^2}{2m^{\\ast}} = \\frac{(eB)^2}{2m^{\\ast}}\\left(x + \\frac{\\hbar k_y}{eB}\\right)^2$$\nThis potential is a harmonic oscillator potential centered at $x_0 = -\\frac{\\hbar k_y}{eB}$. The Schrödinger equation for $\\phi(x)$ becomes:\n$$\\left[ -\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2m^{\\ast}}\\frac{d^2}{dx^2} + \\frac{1}{2}m^{\\ast}\\left(\\frac{eB}{m^{\\ast}}\\right)^2 (x-x_0)^2 \\right]\\phi(x) = E\\phi(x)$$\nThis is precisely the equation for a one-dimensional quantum harmonic oscillator with spring constant $k = m^{\\ast}(eB/m^{\\ast})^2$ and angular frequency $\\omega_c = \\sqrt{k/m^{\\ast}} = eB/m^{\\ast}$, known as the cyclotron frequency. The energy eigenvalues for such a system are quantized and given by:\n$$E_n = \\left(n + \\frac{1}{2}\\right)\\hbar\\omega_c = \\left(n + \\frac{1}{2}\\right)\\frac{\\hbar eB}{m^{\\ast}}$$\nwhere $n=0, 1, 2, \\dots$ is the Landau level index. These are the Landau levels. The energy is independent of the quantum number $k_y$, which implies a massive degeneracy for each level.\n\nNext, we determine this degeneracy. The periodic boundary condition along the $y$-direction, $\\psi(x, y+L_y) = \\psi(x,y)$, quantizes the wavevector $k_y$:\n$$e^{ik_y(y+L_y)} = e^{ik_y y} \\implies e^{ik_y L_y} = 1 \\implies k_y = \\frac{2\\pi j}{L_y}, \\quad j \\in \\mathbb{Z}$$\nThe system is confined to the region $0 \\le x \\le L_x$. The center of the classical cyclotron orbit, $x_0$, which is also the center of the quantum mechanical wavefunction $\\phi(x)$, must be located within the sample. This gives the constraint:\n$$0 \\le x_0 \\le L_x$$\nSubstituting the expression for $x_0$:\n$$0 \\le -\\frac{\\hbar k_y}{eB} \\le L_x$$\nSince $e, B, \\hbar  0$, we multiply by $-eB/\\hbar$ and reverse the inequalities:\n$$0 \\ge k_y \\ge -\\frac{eBL_x}{\\hbar}$$\nNow, we count the number of allowed discrete $k_y$ values within this range. The separation between adjacent allowed $k_y$ values is $\\Delta k_y = 2\\pi/L_y$. The total number of states, $N_{LL}$, for a given Landau level (per spin) is the total range of $k_y$ divided by this separation:\n$$N_{LL} = \\frac{\\left(\\frac{eBL_x}{\\hbar}\\right)}{\\left(\\frac{2\\pi}{L_y}\\right)} = \\frac{e B L_x L_y}{2\\pi\\hbar}$$\nUsing the area $A=L_x L_y$ and Planck's constant $h=2\\pi\\hbar$, we find the number of degenerate orbitals per Landau level:\n$$N_{LL} = \\frac{eBA}{h}$$\nThe problem asks for the degeneracy per unit area per spin, which we denote as $g_B$. In the thermodynamic limit ($L_x, L_y \\to \\infty$), this becomes an exact density:\n$$g_B = \\frac{N_{LL}}{A} = \\frac{eB}{h}$$\nThis quantity represents the number of single-particle states per unit area within each Landau level, for a fixed spin.\n\nFinally, we compute the density of states (DOS) per unit area per spin, $D(E)$. The energy spectrum consists of discrete levels $E_n$, and each level contains $g_B$ states per unit area. For such a discrete spectrum, the DOS is a sum of Dirac delta functions, with each delta function centered at an energy eigenvalue $E_n$ and weighted by the degeneracy density $g_B$ of that level.\n$$D(E) = \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} g_B \\, \\delta(E - E_n)$$\nSubstituting the expressions for $g_B$ and $E_n$, we arrive at the final expression for the DOS per unit area per spin:\n$$D(E) = \\frac{eB}{h} \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} \\delta\\left(E - \\left(n + \\frac{1}{2}\\right)\\frac{\\hbar eB}{m^{\\ast}}\\right)$$\nThe units of $g_B$ are (states/area) and the units of the delta function $\\delta(E-E_n)$ are (1/energy). Thus, the units of $D(E)$ are (states / (area $\\cdot$ energy)), which corresponds to states per square meter per joule, as required. This expression represents a series of infinitely sharp peaks at the Landau level energies.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{eB}{h} \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} \\delta\\left(E - \\left(n + \\frac{1}{2}\\right)\\frac{\\hbar eB}{m^{\\ast}}\\right)}$$", "id": "2822517"}]}
