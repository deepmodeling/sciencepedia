We are tasked with finding the Fermi energy $E_F$ for a system with a low density of electrons.\n\nThe electron filling $x$ is given as very small, $x \\ll 1$. This implies that the electrons occupy states at the very bottom of the energy band. The first step is therefore to identify the minimum of the energy band described by the dispersion relation:\n$$\nE(\\mathbf{k})=-4t\\left(\\cos\\frac{k_x a}{2}\\cos\\frac{k_y a}{2}+\\cos\\frac{k_y a}{2}\\cos\\frac{k_z a}{2}+\\cos\\frac{k_z a}{2}\\cos\\frac{k_x a}{2}\\right)\n$$\nGiven that the hopping amplitude $t  0$, the energy $E(\\mathbf{k})$ is minimized when the expression in the parenthesis is maximized. The cosine function has a maximum value of $1$, which occurs when its argument is zero.

The occupied region is the Fermi sphere, which has volume $V_k = \\frac{4}{3}\\pi k_F^3$.\n$$\nN = 2 \\times \\frac{V_k}{\\left(\\frac{(2\\pi)^3}{V}\\right)} = 2 \\frac{V}{(2\\pi)^3} \\frac{4}{3}\\pi k_F^3 = \\frac{V k_F^3}{3\\pi^2}\n$$\nThe electron density is $n = \\frac{N}{V} = \\frac{k_F^3}{3\\pi^2}$.\nThe face-centered cubic lattice has $4$ atoms in a conventional cubic cell of volume $a^3$. The volume of the primitive cell is thus $V_{cell} = \\frac{a^3}{4}$. The electron filling $x$ is the number of electrons per primitive cell, which is the electron density $n$ multiplied by the primitive cell volume $V_{cell}$.\n$$\nx = n \\cdot V_{cell} = \\left(\\frac{k_F^3}{3\\pi^2}\\right) \\left(\\frac{a^3}{4}\\right) = \\frac{k_F^3 a^3}{12\\pi^2}\n$$\nFrom this, we express $k_F^2$ in terms of $x$:\n$$\nk_F^3 = \\frac{12\\pi^2 x}{a^3} \\implies k_F = \\left(\\frac{12\\pi^2 x}{a^3}\\right)^{1/3} \\implies k_F^2 = \\left(\\frac{12\\pi^2 x}{a^3}\\right)^{2/3} = \\frac{(12\\pi^2 x)^{2/3}}{a^2}\n$$\nFinally, we substitute this expression for $k_F^2$ into our equation for the Fermi energy:\n$$\nE_F = -12t + ta^2 k_F^2 = -12t + ta^2 \\left( \\frac{(12\\pi^2 x)^{2/3}}{a^2} \\right)\n$$\nThis simplifies to the final expression for the Fermi energy as a function of $t$ and $x$:\n$$\nE_F = -12t + t(12\\pi^2 x)^{2/3}\n$$\nThis is the required leading-order result in the low-filling limit $x \\ll 1$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{-12t + t\\left(12\\pi^{2}x\\right)^{\\frac{2}{3}}}\n$$", "id": "2810742"}, {"introduction": "The simple spherical shape of the Fermi surface is only an approximation valid at the very bottom or top of a band.

Thus, the van Hove energy is $E_{vH} = 0$.\n\n**2. Analysis of the Fermi Surface Topology**\n\nThe Fermi surface is the contour in $\\mathbf{k}$-space defined by $\\varepsilon_{0}(\\mathbf{k}) = \\mu$, or $\\cos k_x + \\cos k_y = -\\mu/(2t)$. We analyze its topology as the chemical potential $\\mu$ is tuned through $E_{vH} = 0$.\n\n-   For $\\mu  0$ (e.g., $-4t  \\mu  0$):\n    The band is less than half-filled. The equation is $\\cos k_x + \\cos k_y = C$ with $C  0$. The Fermi surface is a closed, diamond-like contour centered around the band minimum at $\\mathbf{k}=(0,0)$. This is conventionally termed an \"electron-like\" pocket.\n\n-   For $\\mu = 0$ ($E_{vH}$):\n    The equation becomes $\\cos k_x + \\cos k_y = 0$. This surface passes through the saddle points $(\\pi,0)$ and $(0,\\pi)$. The contour is a square with vertices at $(\\pm\\pi, 0)$ and $(0, \\pm\\pi)$, which connects across the boundaries of the BZ. This topology supports \"open orbits\" for an electron moving in a magnetic field perpendicular to the plane.\n\n-   For $\\mu  0$ (e.g., $0  \\mu  4t$):\n    The band is more than half-filled. The equation is $\\cos k_x + \\cos k_y = C$ with $C  0$. It is more convenient to describe the unoccupied states (holes). The holes occupy states around the band maximum at $\\mathbf{k}=(\\pi,\\pi)$. The Fermi surface, viewed as the boundary of the sea of holes, is a closed contour centered on $(\\pi,\\pi)$. This is a \"hole-like\" pocket. The electron Fermi surface itself becomes an open, connected network.\n\nTherefore, as $\\mu$ increases through $E_{vH}=0$, a topological change, known as a Lifshitz transition, occurs. The Fermi surface topology transitions from a closed electron pocket to open orbits, and then to a closed hole pocket (or, equivalently, an open electron surface).\n\n**3. Analysis of the Density of States**\n\nThe density of states (DOS) per unit area is given by\n$$ N(E) = \\frac{1}{(2\\pi)^2} \\int_{\\text{BZ}} d^2k\\, \\delta(E - \\varepsilon_0(\\mathbf{k})) = \\frac{1}{(2\\pi)^2} \\oint_{\\varepsilon_0(\\mathbf{k})=E} \\frac{dl}{|\\nabla_{\\mathbf{k}} \\varepsilon_0(\\mathbf{k})|} $$\nA singularity is expected at $E = E_{vH} = 0$ because the denominator $|\\nabla_{\\mathbf{k}} \\varepsilon_0(\\mathbf{k})|$ vanishes at the saddle points.\nLet us analyze the DOS contribution from the vicinity of a saddle point, for instance, $\\mathbf{k}_s = (0,\\pi)$. Let $\\mathbf{k} = \\mathbf{k}_s + \\mathbf{q}$. For small $\\mathbf{q}=(q_x, q_y)$, we expand the energy:\n$$ \\varepsilon_0(\\mathbf{k}) = -2t(\\cos q_x + \\cos(\\pi+q_y)) = -2t(\\cos q_x - \\cos q_y) $$\n$$ \\approx -2t\\left( (1-\\frac{q_x^2}{2}) - (1-\\frac{q_y^2}{2}) \\right) = t(q_y^2 - q_x^2) $$\nThe DOS contribution for energy $E$ near $E_{vH}=0$ is proportional to the integral:\n$$ N(E) \\propto \\int d q_x \\int d q_y \\, \\delta(E - t(q_y^2 - q_x^2)) $$\nThis is a standard integral for a 2D saddle point. Let $\\epsilon = E/t$. The integral becomes $\\int dq_x \\int dq_y \\, \\delta(\\epsilon - (q_y^2 - q_x^2))$. This integral evaluates to a function that diverges logarithmically as $\\epsilon \\to 0$. Specifically, $N(E) \\propto -\\ln|E - E_{vH}|$.\n\nThus, the DOS for the 2D square lattice exhibits a symmetric logarithmic divergence at the energy of the saddle points.\n\n**4. Evaluation of Options**\n\nWe now evaluate each statement based on our derivations.\n\n*   **A. As $\\mu$ increases from negative to positive through the van Hove energy, the Fermi surface changes from a closed electron-like pocket around $\\mathbf{k}=(0,0)$ to a closed hole-like pocket around $\\mathbf{k}=(\\pi,\\pi)$. The two-dimensional density of states $N(E)$ exhibits a logarithmic divergence at $E$ equal to the van Hove energy due to the saddle points at $\\mathbf{k}=(\\pi,0)$ and $\\mathbf{k}=(0,\\pi)$.**\n    This statement is fully consistent with our analysis. The description of the Fermi surface topology change is a correct characterization of the Lifshitz transition. The statement about the logarithmic divergence of the DOS at the saddle point energy is also correct. **Correct.**\n\n*   **B. As $\\mu$ crosses the van Hove energy, the Fermi surface remains a single simply connected closed contour centered at $\\mathbf{k}=(0,0)$, and $N(E)$ is analytic through the van Hove energy with a finite cusp but no divergence.**\n    This statement is incorrect on two counts. First, the Fermi surface topology fundamentally changes, it does not remain a closed contour around $\\mathbf{k}=(0,0)$ for $\\mu  0$. Second, $N(E)$ is not analytic; it possesses a logarithmic divergence, which is stronger than a finite cusp. **Incorrect.**\n\n*   **C. As $\\mu$ crosses the van Hove energy, the Fermi surface opens into open orbits that traverse the Brillouin Zone for all $\\mu$ above the van Hove energy, and $N(E)$ vanishes as $|E|^{1/2}$ at the van Hove energy.**\n    This statement is incorrect. Open orbits are characteristic of the Fermi surface precisely *at* the van Hove energy $\\mu=0$, not for all $\\mu  0$. For $\\mu  0$, the topology is more accurately described by closed hole pockets. Furthermore, $N(E)$ diverges logarithmically, it does not vanish as $|E|^{1/2}$. **Incorrect.**\n\n*   **D. The Fermi surface topology does not change across the van Hove energy because saddle points do not affect topology; however, $N(E)$ diverges as $1/|E|$ at the van Hove energy.**\n    This statement is flagrantly incorrect. The premise that saddle points do not affect topology is fundamentally false; they are the very cause of such topological transitions. The claim that the DOS diverges as $1/|E|$ is also incorrect; the divergence is logarithmic. **Incorrect.**\n\nOnly statement A provides a correct and physically sound description of the phenomena.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2810725"}]}
