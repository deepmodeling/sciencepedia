The radius of convergence of a Taylor series is determined by the distance to the nearest non-analytic point. In this problem, the DOS, $N(\\epsilon)$, contains a logarithmic singularity at $\\epsilon_{\\mathrm{vH}} = \\mu + \\Delta$. The distance from the point of expansion, $\\mu$, to this singularity is $|\\epsilon_{\\mathrm{vH}} - \\mu| = \\Delta$. Consequently, the expansion in powers of $k_B T$ is only valid as an asymptotic series when the characteristic energy scale of thermal smearing, $k_B T$, is much smaller than the radius of convergence, $\\Delta$. That is, for $k_B T \\ll \\Delta$. When $k_B T$ becomes comparable to $\\Delta$, the thermal kernel $-\\partial f/\\partial\\epsilon$ has significant spectral weight at the energy of the singularity. The assumption of a smoothly varying DOS breaks down, and with it, the validity of the Sommerfeld expansion. The statement is a correct and precise description of the mathematical conditions.\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\n**B. The electronic specific heat coefficient $\\gamma(T)\\equiv C_{\\mathrm{el}}(T)/T$ is enhanced relative to the constant-DOS case and exhibits a pronounced maximum at $T\\sim \\Delta/k_{B}$ as the thermal window begins to overlap the van Hove singularity.**\nFrom first principles, the electronic specific heat is $C_{\\mathrm{el}}(T) = \\int d\\epsilon\\, N(\\epsilon)(\\epsilon-\\mu) \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial T}$. Using the identity $\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial T} = \\frac{\\epsilon-\\mu}{T}(-\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial \\epsilon})$, we obtain $C_{\\mathrm{el}}(T) = \\frac{1}{T}\\int d\\epsilon\\, N(\\epsilon)(\\epsilon-\\mu)^2(-\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial \\epsilon})$. The coefficient $\\gamma(T)=C_{\\mathrm{el}}(T)/T$ is therefore:\n$$ \\gamma(T) = \\frac{1}{T^2} \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} d\\epsilon\\, N(\\epsilon)(\\epsilon-\\mu)^2\\left(-\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial \\epsilon}\\right) $$\nAt low temperatures ($k_B T \\ll \\Delta$), $\\gamma(T) \\approx \\frac{\\pi^2}{3}k_B^2 N(\\mu)$, which is a large constant due to the vHS proximity: $N(\\mu) = N_{\\mathrm{bg}} + N_0 \\ln(\\Lambda/\\Delta)$. As $T$ increases toward $\\Delta/k_B$, the thermal kernel $(\\epsilon-\\mu)^2(-\\partial f/\\partial\\epsilon)$, which preferentially samples energies away from $\\mu$, begins to overlap significantly with the large peak in $N(\\epsilon)$ at $\\mu+\\Delta$. This leads to a substantial increase in the integral, and thus a rise in $\\gamma(T)$. The maximum enhancement is expected when the characteristic energy of the thermal probe matches the energy of the singularity, i.e., $k_B T \\sim \\Delta$. For $k_B T \\gg \\Delta$, the kernel becomes very broad and averages over the singularity, so $\\gamma(T)$ is expected to decrease, resulting in a peak at $T \\sim \\Delta/k_B$.\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\n**C. If $v^{2}(\\epsilon)\\tau(\\epsilon)$ is energy independent, the Lorenz number $L(T)$ equals the Sommerfeld value $L_{0}$ at all $T$, even in the presence of the van Hove singularity.**\nThe Lorenz number is $L(T) = \\frac{\\kappa_{\\mathrm{el}}(T)}{\\sigma(T)T}$. With the given definitions and assuming consistent prefactors that cancel, and taking $v^2\\tau$ to be constant, we have:\n$$ L(T) \\propto \\frac{\\frac{1}{T^2}\\int N(\\epsilon)(\\epsilon-\\mu)^2(-\\partial f/\\partial\\epsilon) d\\epsilon}{\\int N(\\epsilon)(-\\partial f/\\partial\\epsilon) d\\epsilon} $$\nThe Wiedemann-Franz law ($L(T) = L_0 = \\frac{\\pi^2}{3}(k_B/e)^2$) holds if the ratio of the integrals is $\\frac{\\pi^2}{3}(k_B T)^2$. This occurs if $N(\\epsilon)$ is a constant or a linear function of energy over the thermal window. The logarithmic van Hove singularity, $N(\\epsilon)\\propto \\ln(1/|\\epsilon-\\epsilon_{\\mathrm{vH}}|)$, is manifestly not linear. It has non-zero derivatives of all orders at $\\epsilon=\\mu$. In particular, $N''(\\mu) \\neq 0$. The first correction to the Lorenz number in a low-temperature expansion is proportional to $(k_B T)^2 N''(\\mu)/N(\\mu)$. Since this is non-zero, $L(T)$ deviates from $L_0$ even at low $T$, and the deviation becomes large when $k_B T \\sim \\Delta$. The statement is therefore false.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. For $\\Delta>0$ and energy-independent $v^{2}(\\epsilon)\\tau(\\epsilon)$ within the thermal window, $L(T)$ exceeds $L_{0}$ in the regime where $k_{B}T\\sim\\Delta$, because the numerator of $L(T)$ is biased toward higher energies by the factor $(\\epsilon-\\mu)^{2}$ and thereby samples a larger DOS than the denominator.**\nThis statement provides a physical explanation for the violation of the Wiedemann-Franz law. The electrical conductivity $\\sigma$ is an average of $N(\\epsilon)$ over the kernel $-\\partial f/\\partial\\epsilon$, which is peaked at $\\epsilon=\\mu$. The electronic thermal conductivity $\\kappa_{\\mathrm{el}}$ involves an average of $N(\\epsilon)$ over the kernel $(\\epsilon-\\mu)^2(-\\partial f/\\partial\\epsilon)$, which is peaked at energies $\\sim \\pm k_B T$ away from $\\mu$. The van Hove singularity is located at $\\epsilon_{\\mathrm{vH}} = \\mu+\\Delta > \\mu$. When $k_B T \\sim \\Delta$, the probing kernel for $\\kappa_{\\mathrm{el}}$ has a substantial overlap with the region of enhanced DOS at the singularity. The kernel for $\\sigma$, being peaked at $\\mu$, is less sensitive to this feature at $\\mu+\\Delta$. Consequently, $\\kappa_{\\mathrm{el}}$ is enhanced more significantly by the vHS than $\\sigma$ is. This leads to an increase in the ratio $L(T)=\\kappa_{\\mathrm{el}}/(\\sigma T)$ above the universal Sommerfeld value $L_0$. The reasoning presented in the option is physically sound.\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\n**E. The breakdown of the Sommerfeld expansion necessarily implies that the low-temperature electrical resistivity acquires a linear-in-$T$ contribution in the absence of inelastic scattering.**\nThe electrical resistivity is $\\rho(T) = 1/\\sigma(T)$. The temperature dependence of $\\sigma(T)$ in this model arises solely from the thermal smearing of the Fermi-Dirac distribution, as the scattering time $\\tau$ is due to elastic processes and is assumed to be energy-independent (or slowly varying). The low-temperature ($k_B T \\ll \\Delta$) correction to $\\sigma(T)$ from the Sommerfeld expansion is $\\sigma(T) \\approx \\sigma_0 [1 + c (k_B T)^2 N''(\\mu)/N(\\mu)]$, where $c=\\pi^2/6$. This leads to a resistivity $\\rho(T) \\approx \\rho_0 [1 - c (k_B T)^2 N''(\\mu)/N(\\mu)]$. The correction is quadratic in temperature, not linear. A linear-in-$T$ resistivity is a signature of specific inelastic scattering mechanisms (e.g., electron-phonon at high T, or non-Fermi liquid physics) not included in this model. The breakdown of the expansion at $k_B T \\sim \\Delta$ signifies the failure of this $T^2$ description, but it does not \"necessarily imply\" a linear-in-$T$ behavior at low temperatures.

First, we derive the relationship between the low-temperature electronic specific heat coefficient, $\\gamma$, and the density of states at the Fermi level, $N(E_F)$. Second, we justify the universality of the Lorenz number, $L_0$, in the Wiedemann-Franz law.\n\nThe total internal energy, $U(T)$, of an electron gas is given by the integral of energy $E$ multiplied by the number of occupied states. At low temperatures, the change in internal energy from $T=0$ can be evaluated using the standard Sommerfeld expansion:\n$$\\Delta U = U(T) - U(0) \\approx \\frac{\\pi^2}{6} N_{\\mathrm{total}}(E_F) (k_B T)^2$$\nwhere $N_{\\mathrm{total}}(E_F) = 2 N(E_F)$ is the total density of states at the Fermi level, including both spin channels, and $N(E_F)$ is the DOS per spin. The electronic specific heat is then obtained by differentiation with respect to temperature:\n$$C_{\\mathrm{el}}(T) = \\frac{\\partial(\\Delta U)}{\\partial T} = \\frac{\\pi^2}{3} N_{\\mathrm{total}}(E_F) k_B^2 T = \\left( \\frac{2 \\pi^2}{3} N(E_F) k_B^2 \\right) T$$\nThis shows that $C_{\\mathrm{el}}(T) = \\gamma T$, where the coefficient $\\gamma$ per unit cell is $\\gamma_{\\mathrm{cell}} = \\frac{2\\pi^2}{3} N(E_F) k_B^2$.\nThe problem requires $\\gamma$ per mole. We multiply by Avogadro's number $N_A$, as there is one site per unit cell. The molar specific heat coefficient is then $\\gamma_{\\mathrm{molar}} = \\frac{2 \\pi^2}{3} N_A N(E_F) k_B^2$. To convert to the required units of mJ/(mol·K²), we use the values of $N(E_F)$ in states/eV per unit cell, $k_B$ in eV/K, and multiply by the conversion factor from eV to mJ:\n$$\\gamma [\\mathrm{mJ/(mol \\cdot K^2)}] = \\frac{2 \\pi^2}{3} N_A N(E_F)[\\mathrm{eV}^{-1}] (k_B[\\mathrm{eV/K}])^2 \\times (1.602176634 \\times 10^{-16})$$\nThis formula shows that $\\gamma$ is directly proportional to the density of states at the Fermi level, $N(E_F)$. The van Hove singularity at $E_F=0$ causes a large $N(E_F)$, which in turn enhances $\\gamma$.\n\nNext, we consider the Wiedemann-Franz law. This law states that the ratio of the electronic thermal conductivity, $\\kappa_{el}$, to the electrical conductivity, $\\sigma_{el}$, is proportional to temperature, with a universal constant of proportionality called the Lorenz number, $L = \\kappa_{el} / (\\sigma_{el} T)$. Within the semiclassical Boltzmann transport theory and for elastic scattering, both conductivities can be expressed as integrals over the Brillouin zone. At low temperatures, applying the Sommerfeld expansion to these integrals reveals that the terms involving band structure details, including $N(E_F)$, cancel out in the ratio. The result is the universal Lorenz number $L_0$:\n$$L_0 = \\frac{\\kappa_{el}}{\\sigma_{el} T} = \\frac{\\pi^2}{3} \\left(\\frac{k_B}{e}\\right)^2$$\nThis value is independent of the material-specific details like the scattering time $\\tau$ and the density of states $N(E_F)$. Therefore, the enhancement of $N(E_F)$ at the van Hove singularity does not affect the Lorenz number. To compute its value in the required units of W·Ω·K⁻², which is equivalent to V²·K⁻², we use the ratio of the Boltzmann constant $k_B$ in J/K and the elementary charge $e$ in C. This ratio, $k_B/e$, has units of V/K and is numerically identical to the value of $k_B$ in eV/K provided in the problem.\n\nThe numerical implementation proceeds as follows. The density of states per spin, $N(E)$, is calculated by integrating the Dirac delta function over the first Brillouin zone (BZ). This integral is numerically approximated by summing over a discrete $N_k \\times N_k \\times N_k$ grid of points $\\mathbf{k}_i$ spanning the BZ. The Dirac delta is replaced by a normalized Gaussian $G_\\sigma(x)$ of width $\\sigma$. This leads to the discrete estimator:\n$$N(E) \\approx \\frac{1}{N_k^3} \\sum_i G_\\sigma(E-\\epsilon(\\mathbf{k}_i))$$\nThe algorithm for each test case $(t, N_k, \\sigma)$ is:\n1.

Calculate the contribution of each state to the DOS at the Fermi level ($E_F=0$) using the Gaussian: $G_\\sigma(0-\\epsilon(\\mathbf{k}_i)) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi}\\sigma} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\epsilon(\\mathbf{k}_i)^2}{2\\sigma^2}\\right)$.\n4.  Compute $N(E_F=0)$ by taking the mean of these Gaussian values over all $N_k^3$ grid points.\n5.  Use the derived formulas to calculate $\\gamma$ and the constant $L_0$ using the computed $N(E_F)$ and the provided physical constants.\nThis process is repeated for each test case to obtain the required results.", "answer": "```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Computes electronic heat capacity coefficient and Lorenz number for a \n    tight-binding model on a simple cubic lattice.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Physical constants as provided in the problem statement\n    KB_EV_K = 8.617333262145e-5  # Boltzmann constant in eV/K\n    NA = 6.02214076e23           # Avogadro's number in mol^-1\n    EV_TO_mJ = 1.602176634e-16   # Conversion factor from eV to mJ\n    \n    # Test cases from the problem statement: (t, N_k, sigma)\n    test_cases = [\n        (1.0, 50, 0.20),  # Case 1\n        (1.0, 80, 0.07),  # Case 2\n        (1.0, 100, 0.04), # Case 3\n    ]\n\n    # The Wiedemann-Franz Lorenz number L0 is a universal constant.\n    # L0 = (pi^2 / 3) * (kB / e)^2.\n    # The ratio (kB/e) in V/K is numerically equal to kB in eV/K.\n    # The units are W*Ohm/K^2 which is equivalent to V^2/K^2.\n    lorenz_number_l0 = (np.pi**2 / 3) * (KB_EV_K**2)\n\n    all_results = []\n    \n    for t, nk, sigma in test_cases:\n        # Step 1: Numerically compute the density of states at the Fermi level, N(E_F).\n        # We need to sample the first Brillouin zone, k_x,y,z in [-pi, pi).\n        k_vals = np.linspace(-np.pi, np.pi, nk, endpoint=False)\n        kx, ky, kz = np.meshgrid(k_vals, k_vals, k_vals, indexing='ij')\n\n        # The tight-binding dispersion relation for a simple cubic lattice.\n        epsilon_k = -2 * t * (np.cos(kx) + np.cos(ky) + np.cos(kz))\n\n        # The DOS is computed by summing Gaussian-broadened delta functions.\n        # At the Fermi level E_F = 0.\n        # N(E_F) = (1/N_k^3) * sum[ G_sigma(E_F - epsilon_k) ]\n        # G_sigma(x) = (1/(sqrt(2*pi)*sigma)) * exp(-x^2 / (2*sigma^2))\n        gaussian_vals = (1 / (sigma * np.sqrt(2 * np.pi))) * np.exp(-(epsilon_k**2) / (2 * sigma**2))\n        \n        # N(E_F) per spin per unit cell is the mean of the Gaussian values.\n        n_ef = np.mean(gaussian_vals)\n\n        # Step 2: Compute the electronic specific heat coefficient, gamma.\n        # gamma (per mole) = (2 * pi^2 / 3) * N_A * N_spin(E_F) * kB^2\n        # N_spin(E_F) is n_ef calculated above.\n        # We use kB in eV/K and N_ef in 1/eV, then convert final energy unit to mJ.\n        gamma = (2 * np.pi**2 / 3) * NA * n_ef * (KB_EV_K**2) * EV_TO_mJ\n\n        all_results.append([n_ef, gamma, lorenz_number_l0])\n\n    # Step 3: Format the final output string as specified.\n    # Each number is rounded to 6 decimal places.\n    result_strings = []\n    for res in all_results:\n        n_val, gamma_val, l0_val = res\n        result_strings.append(f\"[{n_val:.6f},{gamma_val:.6f},{l0_val:.6f}]\")\n    \n    final_output = f\"[{','.join(result_strings)}]\"\n    print(final_output)\n\nsolve()\n```", "id": "2819267"}]}
