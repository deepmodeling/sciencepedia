Since $\\boldsymbol{k}$ is a function of time, we must use the chain rule. The $i$-th component of acceleration is:\n$$\na_i = \\frac{d v_{g,i}}{dt} = \\sum_{j} \\frac{\\partial v_{g,i}}{\\partial k_j} \\frac{d k_j}{dt}\n$$\nwhere the indices $i, j$ run over the Cartesian components $x, y, z$.

It is more convenient to work with the inverse effective mass tensor, $(\\boldsymbol{m}^*)^{-1}$, which relates acceleration to force: $a_i = \\sum_j (m^{*-1})_{ij} F_{ext,j}$. By comparing this with our derived expression for $a_i$, we can identify the components of the inverse effective mass tensor:\n$$\n(m^{*-1})_{ij} = \\frac{1}{\\hbar} \\frac{\\partial v_{g,i}}{\\partial k_j}\n$$\nNow, we substitute the definition of group velocity, $v_{g,i} = \\frac{1}{\\hbar} \\frac{\\partial E}{\\partial k_i}$, into this expression:\n$$\n(m^{*-1})_{ij} = \\frac{1}{\\hbar} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial k_j} \\left( \\frac{1}{\\hbar} \\frac{\\partial E}{\\partial k_i} \\right) = \\frac{1}{\\hbar^2} \\frac{\\partial^2 E}{\\partial k_i \\partial k_j}\n$$\nThis is the general definition of the inverse effective mass tensor.

The expression then becomes:\n$$\nE(\\mathbf{k}) \\approx -6t + t a^2 k^2\n$$\nThe energy at the zone center is $E(\\mathbf{0}) = -6t$. This is the minimum energy of the conduction band (since $t>0$ for a conduction band minimum at $\\Gamma$). The energy measured from the band edge is $E(\\mathbf{k}) - E(\\mathbf{0}) \\approx t a^2 k^2$.

A hole is the absence of an electron in an otherwise filled band. The total wavevector of a filled band is zero. Removing an electron of wavevector $\\mathbf{k}_e$ leaves the band with a net wavevector $\\mathbf{K} = \\mathbf{0} - \\mathbf{k}_e$. We define the hole wavevector as $\\mathbf{k}_h = -\\mathbf{k}_e$.\nThe equation of motion for the hole is derived from that of the absent electron:\n$$\n\\hbar \\frac{d\\mathbf{k}_h}{dt} = \\hbar \\frac{d(-\\mathbf{k}_e)}{dt} = -\\left(\\hbar \\frac{d\\mathbf{k}_e}{dt}\\right) = -(-e\\mathbf{E}) = +e\\mathbf{E}\n$$\nThis is the equation of motion for a particle with positive charge $q_h = +e$. This is why the hole charge enters transport formulas as $+e$.\n\nThe energy of the hole, $E_h(\\mathbf{k}_h)$, is related to the energy of the electron it replaces, $E_v(\\mathbf{k}_e)$. For a band with inversion symmetry, $E_v(\\mathbf{k}) = E_v(-\\mathbf{k})$, which holds for the given isotropic dispersion. The hole dispersion is defined as $E_h(\\mathbf{k}_h) = -E_v(\\mathbf{k}_e) = -E_v(-\\mathbf{k}_h) = -E_v(\\mathbf{k}_h)$. The hole energy band is the inverted electron energy band.\nThe hole effective mass $m_h^*$ is therefore derived from the curvature of $E_h(\\mathbf{k}_h)$:\n$$\n(m_h^*)^{-1}_{ij} = \\frac{1}{\\hbar^2} \\frac{\\partial^2 E_h(\\mathbf{k}_h)}{\\partial k_{h,i} \\partial k_{h,j}} = \\frac{1}{\\hbar^2} \\frac{\\partial^2 (-E_v(\\mathbf{k}_h))}{\\partial k_{h,i} \\partial k_{h,j}} = - \\left( \\frac{1}{\\hbar^2} \\frac{\\partial^2 E_v(\\mathbf{k}_h)}{\\partial k_{h,i} \\partial k_{h,j}} \\right) = -(m_{e,v}^*)^{-1}_{ij}\n$$\nThis implies $m_h^* = -m_{e,v}^*$. Substituting the result for the electron effective mass:\n$$\nm_h^* = - \\left(-\\frac{\\hbar^2}{C}\\right) = \\frac{\\hbar^2}{C}\n$$\nThe effective mass is isotropic, so the mass along $x$ is $m_{h,x}^* = m_h^*$. Since $C > 0$, the hole effective mass $m_h^*$ is positive. The hole behaves as a particle with positive charge and positive mass.\n\nNext, we consider transport under the single-relaxation-time approximation. In steady state, the momentum gained by a hole from the electric field over a time $\\tau$ is balanced by momentum loss through scattering. The average drift momentum $\\langle \\mathbf{p} \\rangle$ is given by the impulse of the force over the relaxation time $\\tau$:\n$$\n\\langle \\mathbf{p} \\rangle = (+e)\\mathbf{E}\\tau\n$$\nThis drift momentum is related to the drift velocity $\\mathbf{v}_d$ by $\\langle \\mathbf{p} \\rangle = m_h^* \\mathbf{v}_d$. Thus:\n$$\nm_h^* \\mathbf{v}_d = e\\mathbf{E}\\tau \\implies \\mathbf{v}_d = \\frac{e\\tau}{m_h^*} \\mathbf{E}\n$$\nThe drift current density $\\mathbf{J}$ is the product of the hole density $p$, the hole charge $+e$, and the drift velocity $\\mathbf{v}_d$:\n$$\n\\mathbf{J} = p(+e)\\mathbf{v}_d = p e \\left(\\frac{e\\tau}{m_h^*}\\right) \\mathbf{E} = \\frac{p e^2 \\tau}{m_h^*} \\mathbf{E}\n$$\nFor the specified field $\\mathbf{E}=E_{x}\\,\\hat{\\mathbf{x}}$, the $x$-component of the current density is:\n$$\nJ_x = \\left(\\frac{p e^2 \\tau}{m_h^*}\\right) E_x\n$$\nComparing this to the desired form $J_x = p(+e)\\mu_h E_x$, we identify the hole mobility $\\mu_h$:\n$$\np e \\mu_h = \\frac{p e^2 \\tau}{m_h^*} \\implies \\mu_h = \\frac{e\\tau}{m_h^*}\n$$\nSubstituting our derived expression for the hole effective mass, $m_h^* = \\hbar^2/C$:\n$$\n\\mu_h = \\frac{e\\tau}{\\hbar^2/C} = \\frac{e C \\tau}{\\hbar^2}\n$$\nFinally, we evaluate this expression numerically.
