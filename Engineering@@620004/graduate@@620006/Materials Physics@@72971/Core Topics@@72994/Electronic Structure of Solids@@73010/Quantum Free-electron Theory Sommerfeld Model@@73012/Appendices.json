Therefore, the problem is valid and we shall proceed with the derivation and calculation.\n\nThe first task is to derive the relationship between the electron number density, $n$, and the Fermi wavevector, $k_F$. We begin by considering a system of free electrons confined to a cubic volume $V = L^3$ with periodic boundary conditions imposed.\n\nA single-particle wavefunction for a free electron is a plane wave, given by $\\psi_{\\mathbf{k}}(\\mathbf{r}) = A \\exp(i\\mathbf{k} \\cdot \\mathbf{r})$, where $\\mathbf{k}$ is the wavevector. The periodic boundary conditions require that the wavefunction is periodic with period $L$ along each of the three Cartesian axes. For the $x$-direction, this condition is $\\psi(x+L, y, z) = \\psi(x, y, z)$. This leads to the requirement $\\exp(i k_x (x+L)) = \\exp(i k_x x)$, which simplifies to $\\exp(i k_x L) = 1$. The solutions to this equation are $k_x L = 2\\pi m_x$, where $m_x$ is an integer. Generalizing to three dimensions, the allowed components of the wavevector $\\mathbf{k}$ are quantized as:\n$$\nk_x = \\frac{2\\pi m_x}{L}, \\quad k_y = \\frac{2\\pi m_y}{L}, \\quad k_z = \\frac{2\\pi m_z}{L}\n$$\nwhere $m_x, m_y, m_z$ are any integers. These allowed wavevectors form a discrete grid in $\\mathbf{k}$-space. The separation between adjacent points on this grid along any Cartesian axis is $\\Delta k = \\frac{2\\pi}{L}$. The volume in $\\mathbf{k}$-space occupied by a single allowed electronic state (a single point on the grid) is therefore:\n$$\n\\Delta V_k = (\\Delta k_x)(\\Delta k_y)(\\Delta k_z) = \\left(\\frac{2\\pi}{L}\\right)^3 = \\frac{8\\pi^3}{L^3} = \\frac{8\\pi^3}{V}\n$$\nIn the ground state of the free-electron gas at absolute zero temperature ($T=0$), the electrons occupy all available single-particle states up to a maximum energy, the Fermi energy $E_F$. In $\\mathbf{k}$-space, this means all states with a wavevector magnitude $|\\mathbf{k}|$ less than or equal to the Fermi wavevector, $k_F$, are occupied. These occupied states form a sphere of radius $k_F$ in $\\mathbf{k}$-space, known as the Fermi sphere. The volume of this sphere is:\n$$\nV_{FS} = \\frac{4}{3}\\pi k_F^3\n$$\nThe total number of available orbital states, $N_{states}$, within the Fermi sphere is found by dividing the volume of the Fermi sphere by the volume per state, $\\Delta V_k$.\n$$\nN_{states} = \\frac{V_{FS}}{\\Delta V_k} = \\frac{\\frac{4}{3}\\pi k_F^3}{8\\pi^3 / V} = \\frac{4\\pi k_F^3 V}{24\\pi^3} = \\frac{V k_F^3}{6\\pi^2}\n$$\nAccording to the Pauli exclusion principle, each orbital state $\\mathbf{k}$ can accommodate two electrons, one with spin up and one with spin down. This is the two-fold spin degeneracy mentioned in the problem. Therefore, the total number of electrons, $N$, is twice the number of occupied orbital states:\n$$\nN = 2 \\times N_{states} = 2 \\left(\\frac{V k_F^3}{6\\pi^2}\\right) = \\frac{V k_F^3}{3\\pi^2}\n$$\nThe electron number density, $n$, is defined as the total number of electrons per unit volume, $n = N/V$.\n$$\nn = \\frac{N}{V} = \\frac{1}{V} \\left( \\frac{V k_F^3}{3\\pi^2} \\right) = \\frac{k_F^3}{3\\pi^2}\n$$\nThis is the fundamental relationship between the electron number density and the Fermi wavevector in the Sommerfeld model.\n\nThe second task is to compute the numerical value of $k_F$ for sodium.

The Fermi energy is related to the Fermi wave vector $k_F$ by $E_F = \\frac{\\hbar^2 k_F^2}{2m}$.\n\nThe total number of available orbital states, $N_{orb}$, inside this Fermi sphere is the volume of the sphere, $V_k = \\frac{4}{3}\\pi k_F^3$, divided by the volume per state, $\\Delta V_{\\mathbf{k}}$.\n$$N_{orb} = \\frac{V_k}{\\Delta V_{\\mathbf{k}}} = \\frac{\\frac{4}{3}\\pi k_F^3}{8\\pi^3 / V} = \\frac{V k_F^3}{6\\pi^2}$$\nEach orbital state can be occupied by two electrons due to spin degeneracy (spin-up and spin-down).
