When a finite dielectric is placed in an external electric field, the induced surface charges create an internal \"depolarizing field\" that opposes the external field. In this practice, you will tackle the classic electrostatics problem of a long dielectric cylinder to explicitly calculate the depolarization factors both parallel and perpendicular to its axis, providing a concrete understanding of how material geometry governs the internal electric field [@problem_id:2814020]. This exercise reinforces the application of electrostatic boundary conditions and connects the specific case of a cylinder to the more general theory of depolarization in ellipsoids.", "problem": "A long, solid, circular cylinder of radius $a$ made of a homogeneous, isotropic, linear dielectric with relative permittivity $\\epsilon_{r}$ is embedded in vacuum. The cylinder’s axis is the $z$ axis and the system is in electrostatic equilibrium. Two experiments are performed:\n- Case $1$: a uniform external electric field $\\mathbf{E}_{0}$ is applied parallel to the cylinder axis, $\\mathbf{E}_{0} = E_{0}\\,\\hat{\\mathbf{z}}$.\n- Case $2$: a uniform external electric field $\\mathbf{E}_{0}$ is applied perpendicular to the cylinder axis, $\\mathbf{E}_{0} = E_{0}\\,\\hat{\\mathbf{x}}$.\n\nUsing only the electrostatic boundary conditions at the vacuum–dielectric interface, and the constitutive relation $\\mathbf{D} = \\epsilon \\mathbf{E}$ with $\\epsilon = \\epsilon_{0} \\epsilon_{r}$ inside the cylinder and $\\epsilon = \\epsilon_{0}$ outside, determine the depolarization factors along the principal axes of the cylinder.

We may proceed with the solution.\n\nThe problem asks for the determination of the depolarization factors, $N_{\\parallel}$ and $N_{\\perp}$, for a long, solid, circular dielectric cylinder. The depolarization factor $N_i$ is defined via the relationship between the uniform internal polarization $\\mathbf{P}$ along a principal axis $i$ and the resulting internal depolarizing field $\\mathbf{E}_{\\mathrm{dep}}$:\n$$ \\mathbf{E}_{\\mathrm{dep}} = - \\frac{N_{i}}{\\epsilon_{0}} \\mathbf{P} $$\nThe total electric field inside the dielectric, $\\mathbf{E}_{\\mathrm{in}}$, is the superposition of the applied external field, $\\mathbf{E}_{0}$, and the depolarizing field:\n$$ \\mathbf{E}_{\\mathrm{in}} = \\mathbf{E}_{0} + \\mathbf{E}_{\\mathrm{dep}} $$\nFor a linear, homogeneous, and isotropic dielectric, the polarization is related to the internal electric field by:\n$$ \\mathbf{P} = \\epsilon_{0} \\chi \\mathbf{E}_{\\mathrm{in}} $$\nwhere $\\chi = \\epsilon_{r} - 1$ is the electric susceptibility.

Case 1: External field parallel to the cylinder axis, $\\mathbf{E}_{0} = E_{0}\\,\\hat{\\mathbf{z}}$**\n\nIn this configuration, the cylinder is assumed to be infinitely long. The external field $\\mathbf{E}_{0}$ is uniform and directed along the cylinder axis ($\\hat{\\mathbf{z}}$ axis). At the cylindrical surface $r=a$, the unit normal vector is $\\hat{\\mathbf{n}} = \\hat{\\mathbf{r}}$ (in cylindrical coordinates). The applied electric field is therefore everywhere parallel to the boundary surface, or, more precisely, the component of the field normal to the surface is zero.\n\nThe electrostatic boundary conditions at the interface between two dielectrics are:\n1. The tangential component of the electric field $\\mathbf{E}$ is continuous: $\\mathbf{E}_{\\mathrm{out,tan}} = \\mathbf{E}_{\\mathrm{in,tan}}$.\n2. The normal component of the electric displacement field $\\mathbf{D}$ is continuous (assuming no free surface charge): $D_{\\mathrm{out,n}} = D_{\\mathrm{in,n}}$.\n\nLet $\\mathbf{E}_{\\mathrm{in}}$ be the field inside the cylinder ($r<a$) and $\\mathbf{E}_{\\mathrm{out}}$ be the field outside ($r>a$). Due to the symmetry of the problem, the fields must be directed along the $\\hat{\\mathbf{z}}$ axis everywhere, i.e., $\\mathbf{E} = E_{z}(r)\\hat{\\mathbf{z}}$.\nThe tangential component of the field is the entire field itself. The continuity of the tangential component of $\\mathbf{E}$ at $r=a$ implies $E_{\\mathrm{in,z}} = E_{\\mathrm{out,z}}$.\nThe normal component of $\\mathbf{E}$ is $E_{r} = \\mathbf{E} \\cdot \\hat{\\mathbf{r}} = (E_{z}\\hat{\\mathbf{z}}) \\cdot \\hat{\\mathbf{r}} = 0$.\nThe boundary condition on $\\mathbf{D}$ is $D_{\\mathrm{in,n}} = \\epsilon_{r}\\epsilon_{0}E_{\\mathrm{in,r}} = \\epsilon_{0}E_{\\mathrm{out,r}} = D_{\\mathrm{out,n}}$. Since $E_{r}=0$ everywhere, this condition becomes $0=0$ and yields no information.\n\nAlternatively, consider the bound charges. The polarization $\\mathbf{P}$ within the cylinder is uniform and parallel to the axis, $\\mathbf{P} = P\\hat{\\mathbf{z}}$. The volume bound charge density is $\\rho_{b} = -\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{P} = 0$. The surface bound charge density is $\\sigma_{b} = \\mathbf{P} \\cdot \\hat{\\mathbf{n}} = (P\\hat{\\mathbf{z}}) \\cdot \\hat{\\mathbf{r}} = 0$. Since there are no bound charges, the polarized cylinder produces no electric field, either inside or outside. Consequently, the field is unperturbed by the presence of the cylinder.\nThus, the field is uniform throughout all space:\n$$ \\mathbf{E}_{\\mathrm{in},\\parallel} = \\mathbf{E}_{0} = E_{0}\\,\\hat{\\mathbf{z}} $$\nFrom this, the depolarizing field is $\\mathbf{E}_{\\mathrm{dep}} = \\mathbf{E}_{\\mathrm{in},\\parallel} - \\mathbf{E}_{0} = \\mathbf{0}$.\nFrom the definition $\\mathbf{E}_{\\mathrm{dep}} = - N_{\\parallel}\\mathbf{P}/\\epsilon_{0}$, and noting that the polarization $\\mathbf{P} = \\epsilon_{0}(\\epsilon_{r}-1)\\mathbf{E}_{\\mathrm{in},\\parallel}$ is non-zero (for $\\epsilon_{r} \\neq 1$), we must conclude that the depolarization factor is zero:\n$$ N_{\\parallel} = 0 $$\n\n**2. Case 2: External field perpendicular to the cylinder axis, $\\mathbf{E}_{0} = E_{0}\\,\\hat{\\mathbf{x}}$**\n\nThis is a two-dimensional electrostatic problem in the $xy$-plane. We solve Laplace's equation $\\nabla^2V=0$ for the electric potential $V$ ($\\mathbf{E} = -\\nabla V$). Far from the cylinder, the potential must approach that of the uniform external field: $V \\to -E_{0}x = -E_{0}r\\cos\\phi$.\n\nWe postulate solutions of the form $f(r)\\cos\\phi$ based on the symmetry of the external field.\nInside the cylinder ($r<a$), the potential must be finite at the origin. The solution to Laplace's equation is of the form:\n$$ V_{\\mathrm{in}}(r, \\phi) = -A r \\cos\\phi $$\nThis corresponds to a uniform internal field $\\mathbf{E}_{\\mathrm{in}} = -\\nabla V_{\\mathrm{in}} = A\\,\\hat{\\mathbf{x}}$.\nOutside the cylinder ($r>a$), the potential must approach $-E_{0}r\\cos\\phi$ as $r \\to \\infty$. The solution is:\n$$ V_{\\mathrm{out}}(r, \\phi) = -E_{0} r \\cos\\phi + B r^{-1} \\cos\\phi $$\nwhere the term $B r^{-1} \\cos\\phi$ represents the disturbance caused by the polarized cylinder.\n\nThe boundary conditions at $r=a$ are:\n1. $V_{\\mathrm{in}}(a, \\phi) = V_{\\mathrm{out}}(a, \\phi)$:\n$$ -A a \\cos\\phi = -E_{0} a \\cos\\phi + B a^{-1} \\cos\\phi \\implies -A a = -E_{0} a + \\frac{B}{a} \\quad (1) $$\n2. $D_{\\mathrm{in,n}} = D_{\\mathrm{out,n}}$, which is $\\epsilon_{r}\\epsilon_{0} E_{\\mathrm{in,r}} = \\epsilon_{0} E_{\\mathrm{out,r}}$ at $r=a$. The radial component of the field is $E_{r} = -\\partial V / \\partial r$.\n$$ E_{\\mathrm{in,r}} = A \\cos\\phi $$\n$$ E_{\\mathrm{out,r}} = E_{0} \\cos\\phi + B r^{-2} \\cos\\phi $$\nAt $r=a$, the boundary condition becomes:\n$$ \\epsilon_{r} (A \\cos\\phi) = E_{0} \\cos\\phi + B a^{-2} \\cos\\phi \\implies \\epsilon_{r} A = E_{0} + \\frac{B}{a^2} \\quad (2) $$\nFrom equation (1), we have $B = a^{2}(E_{0} - A)$. Substituting this into equation (2):\n$$ \\epsilon_{r} A = E_{0} + \\frac{a^{2}(E_{0} - A)}{a^2} = E_{0} + E_{0} - A = 2E_{0} - A $$\n$$ A(\\epsilon_{r} + 1) = 2E_{0} \\implies A = \\frac{2}{\\epsilon_{r} + 1} E_{0} $$\nThe internal field is therefore uniform and given by:\n$$ \\mathbf{E}_{\\mathrm{in},\\perp} = \\frac{2}{\\epsilon_{r} + 1} \\mathbf{E}_{0} $$\nWe now compare this result with the general formula for the internal field in terms of the depolarization factor:\n$$ \\mathbf{E}_{\\mathrm{in}} = \\frac{1}{1 + N_{\\perp} (\\epsilon_{r} - 1)} \\mathbf{E}_{0} $$\nEquating the scalar prefactors:\n$$ \\frac{2}{\\epsilon_{r} + 1} = \\frac{1}{1 + N_{\\perp} (\\epsilon_{r} - 1)} $$\n$$ 2 \\left(1 + N_{\\perp} (\\epsilon_{r} - 1)\\right) = \\epsilon_{r} + 1 $$\n$$ 2 + 2 N_{\\perp} (\\epsilon_{r} - 1) = \\epsilon_{r} + 1 $$\n$$ 2 N_{\\perp} (\\epsilon_{r} - 1) = \\epsilon_{r} - 1 $$\nAssuming $\\epsilon_{r} \\neq 1$, we can divide by $(\\epsilon_{r} - 1)$ to find $N_{\\perp}$:\n$$ 2 N_{\\perp} = 1 \\implies N_{\\perp} = \\frac{1}{2} $$\nBy symmetry, the depolarization factor is the same for any axis perpendicular to the cylinder's main axis. Thus, we have $N_{x} = N_{y} = N_{\\perp} = 1/2$.\n\n**3. Comparison with Prolate Spheroid**\n\nFor a general ellipsoid, the sum of the depolarization factors along the three principal axes is unity: $N_{x} + N_{y} + N_{z} = 1$. For our infinitely long cylinder with its axis along $\\hat{\\mathbf{z}}$, the principal axes are $\\hat{\\mathbf{x}}$, $\\hat{\\mathbf{y}}$, and $\\hat{\\mathbf{z}}$. The corresponding depolarization factors are $N_{\\perp}$, $N_{\\perp}$, and $N_{\\parallel}$. Let us check the sum rule:\n$$ N_{x} + N_{y} + N_{z} = N_{\\perp} + N_{\\perp} + N_{\\parallel} = \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{2} + 0 = 1 $$\nThe sum rule is satisfied. This is consistent with the cylinder being a limiting case of an ellipsoid.\n\nA prolate spheroid with semi-axes $c > a = b$ (rotated about the $z$-axis) becomes an infinite cylinder in the limit of infinite aspect ratio, $c/a \\to \\infty$. The depolarization factors for a prolate spheroid are known. In the limit as the eccentricity $e = \\sqrt{1 - (a/c)^2} \\to 1$, the longitudinal factor $N_{\\parallel}$ (along the axis of revolution) approaches $0$, and the transverse factors $N_{\\perp}$ approach $1/2$. Our calculated values of $N_{\\parallel} = 0$ and $N_{\\perp} = 1/2$ are in perfect agreement with this known result.\n\nThe depolarization factors along the principal axes (parallel, perpendicular, perpendicular) are $(0, 1/2, 1/2)$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n0 & \\frac{1}{2} & \\frac{1}{2}\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "2814020"}, {"introduction": "Many advanced materials, particularly single crystals, exhibit an anisotropic dielectric response, meaning their polarization properties depend on the direction of the applied electric field.

This induced microscopic potential would not exist if the dielectric matrix were diagonal.\n\nNow, we substitute this expression for $V_{1}^{\\mathrm{tot}}$ back into equation $(1)$:\n$$V_{0}^{\\mathrm{ext}} = \\epsilon_{00} V_{0}^{\\mathrm{tot}} + \\epsilon_{01} \\left( -\\frac{\\epsilon_{10}}{\\epsilon_{11}} V_{0}^{\\mathrm{tot}} \\right)$$\nFactoring out $V_{0}^{\\mathrm{tot}}$:\n$$V_{0}^{\\mathrm{ext}} = \\left( \\epsilon_{00} - \\frac{\\epsilon_{01}\\epsilon_{10}}{\\epsilon_{11}} \\right) V_{0}^{\\mathrm{tot}}$$\n\nThe problem defines the macroscopic dielectric constant $\\epsilon_M$ as the ratio of the external to the total macroscopic potential in the long-wavelength limit:\n$$\\epsilon_{M} = \\frac{V^{\\mathrm{ext}}_{\\mathbf{G}=\\mathbf{0}}}{V^{\\mathrm{tot}}_{\\mathbf{G}=\\mathbf{0}}} = \\frac{V_{0}^{\\mathrm{ext}}}{V_{0}^{\\mathrm{tot}}}$$\nFrom our derived relation, we obtain the expression for $\\epsilon_M$:\n$$\\epsilon_{M} = \\epsilon_{00} - \\frac{\\epsilon_{01}\\epsilon_{10}}{\\epsilon_{11}}$$\nFor a centrosymmetric crystal, the dielectric matrix is symmetric, so $\\epsilon_{01} = \\epsilon_{10}$. The expression simplifies to:\n$$\\epsilon_{M} = \\epsilon_{00} - \\frac{\\epsilon_{01}^{2}}{\\epsilon_{11}}$$\nThis result explicitly shows how the off-diagonal elements of the dielectric matrix affect the macroscopic dielectric constant. The term $-\\epsilon_{01}^{2}/\\epsilon_{11}$ is a correction to the diagonal component $\\epsilon_{00}$ arising from local-field effects. This correction reduces the value of $\\epsilon_M$ relative to $\\epsilon_{00}$, indicating that the coupling between macroscopic and microscopic scales of polarization leads to a reduction in the overall screening capability of the material. This result is equivalent to the well-known formula $\\epsilon_{M} = 1 / (\\epsilon^{-1})_{00}$, where $(\\epsilon^{-1})_{00}$ is the $(\\mathbf{0},\\mathbf{0})$ element of the inverse dielectric matrix.\n\nFinally, we compute the numerical value of $\\epsilon_{M}$ using the provided matrix:\n$$\n\\epsilon_{\\mathbf{G}\\mathbf{G}'}=\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n5.0 & 1.2 \\\\\n1.2 & 3.0\n\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe components are $\\epsilon_{00} = 5.0$, $\\epsilon_{01} = 1.2$, and $\\epsilon_{11} = 3.0$. Substituting these values into our derived formula:\n$$\\epsilon_{M} = 5.0 - \\frac{(1.2)^{2}}{3.0}$$\n$$\\epsilon_{M} = 5.0 - \\frac{1.44}{3.0}$$\n$$\\epsilon_{M} = 5.0 - 0.48$$\n$$\\epsilon_{M} = 4.52$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures. Therefore, the result is $4.520$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{4.520}$$", "id": "2814046"}]}
