It approximates the complex vibrational spectrum of a crystal lattice with a simplified, continuous model. Consider a simple three-dimensional, monoatomic solid containing $N$ atoms in a volume $V$. The number density of atoms is given by $n = N/V$.\n\nThe key assumptions of the Debye model are:\n1.  The solid is treated as a continuous elastic medium.\n2.  The dispersion relation for phonons is linear and isotropic for all polarizations: $\\omega(\\vec{k}) = v_s |\\vec{k}|$, where $\\omega$ is the angular frequency, $\\vec{k}$ is the wavevector, and $v_s$ is an effective speed of sound, assumed to be constant for all modes.\n3.  The total number of vibrational modes is fixed at $3N$, corresponding to the classical degrees of freedom of the $N$ atoms.\n4.  To satisfy the previous condition, a cutoff frequency, the Debye frequency $\\omega_D$, is introduced. No modes with frequency greater than $\\omega_D$ exist. This implies there is a corresponding cutoff wavevector, $k_D$, such that all allowed modes lie within a sphere of radius $k_D$ in k-space (the Debye sphere).\n\nUsing these assumptions, derive an expression for the Debye frequency $\\omega_D$ in terms of the number density of atoms $n$ and the effective speed of sound $v_s$.", "solution": "The goal is to find the Debye frequency $\\omega_D$ as a function of the number density of atoms $n$ and the effective speed of sound $v_s$. The derivation proceeds by determining the cutoff wavevector $k_D$ that ensures the total number of vibrational modes is equal to $3N$.\n\n**Step 1: Quantization of wavevectors in k-space**\n\nFor a solid of volume $V = L^3$ with periodic boundary conditions, the allowed wavevectors $\\vec{k} = (k_x, k_y, k_z)$ are quantized:\n$$ k_i = \\frac{2\\pi m_i}{L} \\quad \\text{for} \\quad i = x, y, z $$\nwhere $m_i$ are integers. This means that each allowed $\\vec{k}$ vector occupies a volume of $(2\\pi/L)^3 = (2\\pi)^3/V$ in k-space. The density of states in k-space is the reciprocal of this volume, $V/(2\\pi)^3$.\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the total number of modes within the Debye sphere**\n\nThe total number of vibrational modes in the solid is $3N$. In the Debye model, these modes are assumed to be distributed within a sphere of radius $k_D$ in k-space. For each allowed $\\vec{k}$ vector, there are three orthogonal polarization modes (one longitudinal and two transverse). The model simplifies this by assuming they all have the same speed of sound $v_s$.\n\nTo find the total number of modes, we multiply the number of allowed $\\vec{k}$ states within the Debye sphere by the number of polarizations (3). The number of $\\vec{k}$ states is found by integrating the k-space density of states over the volume of the Debye sphere.\n\n$$ 3N = (\\text{number of polarizations}) \\times (\\text{density of k-states}) \\times (\\text{volume of Debye sphere}) $$\n$$ 3N = 3 \\times \\frac{V}{(2\\pi)^3} \\times \\left( \\int_{|\\vec{k}| \\le k_D} d^3k \\right) $$\n\nThe integral is simply the volume of a sphere of radius $k_D$ in 3D k-space, which is $\\frac{4}{3}\\pi k_D^3$.\n\n$$ 3N = 3 \\times \\frac{V}{(2\\pi)^3} \\times \\left( \\frac{4}{3}\\pi k_D^3 \\right) $$\n\n**Step 3: Solve for the Debye wavevector $k_D$**\n\nWe can simplify the expression from Step 2. The factor of 3 on both sides cancels out:\n$$ N = \\frac{V}{8\\pi^3} \\times \\frac{4\\pi}{3} k_D^3 $$\n$$ N = \\frac{V k_D^3}{6\\pi^2} $$\n\nNow, we solve for $k_D^3$.

It describes a standard scenario in the harmonic theory of lattice dynamics. All provided information is consistent and sufficient for a rigorous derivation.
