Consequently, the lattice heat capacity follows the well-known Debye $T^3$ law:\n$$ C_{\\text{lat}}(T, \\Theta_D) \\approx \\left(\\frac{12\\pi^4 R}{5\\Theta_D^3}\\right) T^3 = A_D T^3 $$\nThe total heat capacity is $C_{\\text{model}} \\approx A_D T^3 + \\gamma T$. Rearranging this expression reveals a linear relationship:\n$$ \\frac{C_{\\text{model}}}{T} \\approx \\gamma + A_D T^2 $$\nBy performing a linear regression on the transformed experimental data $(T_i^2, C_i/T_i)$, we can obtain initial guesses. The intercept of the line $y=mx+c$ provides an estimate for $\\gamma_0$, and the slope provides an estimate for $\\Theta_{D,0}$ through the relation $A_D = m$:\n$$ \\gamma_0 = c \\quad ; \\quad \\Theta_{D,0} = \\left(\\frac{12\\pi^4 R}{5m}\\right)^{1/3} $$\nThis method provides robust, physically motivated starting values for the nonlinear optimization.\n\nThe implementation involves creating a Python function for $C_{\\text{model}}(T, \\Theta_D, \\gamma)$ that numerically evaluates the Debye integral using `scipy.integrate.quad`. For each dataset, synthetic data are generated as specified. Then, initial guesses are calculated, and `scipy.optimize.curve_fit` is executed with the data, uncertainties, initial guesses, and parameter bounds. The fitted value of $\\Theta_D$ for each dataset is then collected and printed in the required format.", "answer": "```python\n# The complete and runnable Python 3 code goes here.\n# Imports must adhere to the specified execution environment.\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy import constants, integrate, optimize\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves for the Debye temperature by fitting heat capacity data.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define physical constant R\n    R = constants.R  # Molar gas constant in J/(mol K)\n\n    def debye_integrand(x):\n        \"\"\"\n        Numerically stable integrand for the Debye heat capacity formula.\n        \"\"\"\n        # The term np.expm1(x) is equivalent to np.exp(x) -
