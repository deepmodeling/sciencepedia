This is an eigenvalue problem, where the eigenvalues are $\\lambda = m\\omega^{2}$ and the eigenvectors $\\mathbf{v}$ define the normal modes.

The eigenvector is proportional to $\\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}$. To normalize this vector to have a Euclidean norm of $1$, we set its normalized form $\\mathbf{u}_{1} = C \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}$ and require $||\\mathbf{u}_{1}||^{2} = C^{2}(1^{2} + 1^{2}) = 2C^{2} = 1$.

The normalized eigenvector is:\n$$\\mathbf{u}_{1} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\\\ \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\end{pmatrix}$$\nThis mode is symmetric, as the components are equal ($v_{1}=v_{2}$), meaning the two atoms move in phase with the same amplitude. This is an acoustic-like mode. The atoms move together, and the spring between them is not compressed or stretched. The frequency is determined solely by the external springs, as if the two atoms were a single rigid body. In an infinite crystal, this corresponds to a translational mode, which at the Brillouin-zone center ($q=0$) has zero frequency. Here, the frequency is non-zero due to the restoring force from the rigid walls.\n\nFor the higher frequency $\\omega_{2} = \\sqrt{(k+2k')/m}$, we have $m\\omega_{2}^{2} = k+2k'$. The eigenvalue equation is:\n$$\\begin{pmatrix} k+k' - (k+2k') & -k' \\\\ -k' & k+k' - (k+2k') \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} v_{1} \\\\ v_{2} \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} -k' & -k' \\\\ -k' & -k' \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} v_{1} \\\\ v_{2} \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}$$\nThis leads to the equation $-k'v_{1} - k'v_{2} = 0$, which simplifies to $v_{1} = -v_{2}$. The eigenvector is proportional to $\\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ -1 \\end{pmatrix}$. Normalizing this vector gives $\\mathbf{u}_{2} = C \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ -1 \\end{pmatrix}$ with $|| \\mathbf{u}_{2} ||^{2} = C^{2}(1^{2} + (-1)^{2}) = 2C^{2} = 1$, so $C = 1/\\sqrt{2}$. The normalized eigenvector is:\n$$\\mathbf{u}_{2} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\\\ -\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\end{pmatrix}$$\nThis mode is antisymmetric, as the components are equal and opposite ($v_{1}=-v_{2}$), meaning the atoms move out of phase with the same amplitude. This is an optical-like mode. The atoms move against each other, causing the central spring to be maximally compressed and stretched. The center of mass of the pair of atoms remains stationary. This type of motion involves relative displacement of atoms within a basis, which corresponds to an optical phonon branch in a crystal. This mode has a finite frequency at the Brillouin-zone center.\n\nThe final results, listed in the specified order, are the lower frequency $\\omega_{1}$, the higher frequency $\\omega_{2}$, the two components of the normalized eigenvector for $\\omega_{1}$, and the two components of the normalized eigenvector for $\\omega_{2}$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} \\sqrt{\\frac{k}{m}} & \\sqrt{\\frac{k+2k'}{m}} & \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} & \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} & \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} & -\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\end{pmatrix}}$$", "id": "2807017"}, {"introduction": "Building upon the concept of normal modes in a two-atom system, we now scale up to an entire one-dimensional crystal.

We note that\n$$\n\\alpha^2 q^2 + \\frac{p^2}{\\alpha^2\\hbar^2} = \\frac{m\\omega}{\\hbar}q^2 + \\frac{p^2}{(m\\omega/\\hbar)\\hbar^2} = \\frac{m\\omega q^2}{\\hbar} + \\frac{p^2}{m\\omega\\hbar} = \\frac{2}{\\hbar\\omega} \\left(\\frac{1}{2}m\\omega^2q^2 + \\frac{p^2}{2m}\\right) = \\frac{2H_{cl}}{\\hbar\\omega}\n$$\nTherefore, the final closed-form expression for the Wigner function of the number state $\\lvert n \\rangle$ is\n$$\nW_n(q,p) = \\frac{(-1)^n}{\\pi\\hbar} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{2H_{cl}}{\\hbar\\omega}\\right) L_n\\left(\\frac{4H_{cl}}{\\hbar\\omega}\\right)\n$$\nExplicitly in terms of $q$ and $p$, this is\n$$\nW_n(q,p) = \\frac{(-1)^n}{\\pi\\hbar} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{p^2}{m\\hbar\\omega} - \\frac{m\\omega q^2}{\\hbar}\\right) L_n\\left(\\frac{2p^2}{m\\hbar\\omega} + \\frac{2m\\omega q^2}{\\hbar}\\right)\n$$\nNow, we must identify and interpret the regions where $W_n(q,p) < 0$. The exponential factor is always positive. Thus, the sign of $W_n(q,p)$ is determined by the sign of $(-1)^n L_n(X)$, where $X = 4H_{cl}/(\\hbar\\omega)$. The variable $X$ is non-negative and represents the classical energy in units of $\\hbar\\omega/4$.\n\nThe Laguerre polynomial $L_n(X)$ is a polynomial of degree $n$ with $n$ distinct, positive real roots, let them be $z_1 < z_2 < \\dots < z_n$. Since $L_n(0)=1$, the function $(-1)^n L_n(X)$ has the value $(-1)^n$ at $X=0$ (the phase-space origin).\nThe regions of negativity are given by the condition $(-1)^n L_n(X) < 0$.\nFor odd $n$: We need $L_n(X) > 0$. The roots of $L_n(X)$ partition the positive real axis. Since $L_n(0)=1$, the function is positive on $(0, z_1)$, negative on $(z_1, z_2)$, and so on. Thus, for odd $n$, the negative regions for $W_n(q,p)$ correspond to $H_{cl}$ values such that $4H_{cl}/(\\hbar\\omega)$ falls into intervals $(0, z_1), (z_2, z_3), \\dots$.\nFor even $n$: We need $L_n(X) < 0$. The regions are $(z_1, z_2), (z_3, z_4), \\dots$.\n\nIn all cases, the boundaries of these negative regions are defined by $4H_{cl}/(\\hbar\\omega) = z_k$ for $k=1, \\dots, n$. This corresponds to $H_{cl}(q,p) = \\frac{\\hbar\\omega}{4}z_k$. In the $(q,p)$ phase space, curves of constant $H_{cl}$ are ellipses centered at the origin. Therefore, the regions where $W_n(q,p)$ is negative are a set of disjoint annular regions. For odd $n$, the innermost region is a filled ellipse that includes the origin. For even $n$, the origin is not in a negative region. For example, for $n=1$, $L_1(X) = 1-X$. $W_1(q,p)$ is negative when $-L_1(X) = X-1 < 0$, i.e., $X<1$. This is the region $H_{cl} < \\hbar\\omega/4$, a central ellipse.\n\nThe existence of regions where the Wigner function is negative is a definitive signature of the nonclassical nature of the quantum state. A true classical probability distribution in phase space must be non-negative everywhere. The negativity of $W_n(q,p)$ is a direct violation of this classical condition. These negative values are a consequence of quantum interference in phase space; they arise from the oscillatory nature of the off-diagonal elements of the density matrix $\\hat{\\rho} = |n\\rangle\\langle n|$, which represent quantum coherence. For the highly nonclassical Fock states, which possess a definite number of quanta (and thus do not correspond to any classical field configuration), these strong nonclassical features are expected. The fact that the geometry of these negative regions is dictated by the level sets of the classical Hamiltonian reflects the stationary nature of the energy eigenstates under the system's own time evolution.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\frac{(-1)^n}{\\pi\\hbar} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{p^2}{m\\hbar\\omega} - \\frac{m\\omega q^2}{\\hbar}\\right) L_n\\left(\\frac{2p^2}{m\\hbar\\omega} + \\frac{2m\\omega q^2}{\\hbar}\\right)}\n$$", "id": "2807051"}]}
