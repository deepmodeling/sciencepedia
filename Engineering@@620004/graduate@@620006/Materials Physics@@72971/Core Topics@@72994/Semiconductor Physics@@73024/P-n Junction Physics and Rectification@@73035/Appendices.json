Assume complete ionization, negligible fixed charge other than the ionized donors, and that under reverse bias the depletion region extends entirely through the drift region at the specified blocking voltage. Under forward conduction at high-level injection, the drift region is assumed quasi-neutral with excess carrier density approximately uniform and dominated by Shockley–Read–Hall recombination with a spatially uniform carrier lifetime $\\tau$; the excess plasma provides conductivity modulation so that the drift-region voltage drop is dominated by ohmic conduction through the plasma.\n\nThe device must block a reverse voltage $V_{B}$ with a design margin to avalanche breakdown implemented by limiting the peak electric field at $V_{B}$ to a fraction $\\alpha$ of the material’s avalanche critical field $E_{c}$, so that the peak field satisfies $E_{\\max}=\\alpha E_{c}$ at $V=V_{B}$.

It is a standard problem in semiconductor device physics, concerning the design of a punch-through rectifier structure. The problem is well-posed, scientifically grounded, and all parameters are defined and physically consistent. We will proceed to derive the solution from first principles.\n\nThe device is a $p^{+}\\text{-}n\\text{-}n^{+}$ structure, where the reverse blocking capability is determined by the properties of the lightly doped $n$-type drift region. Under reverse bias, a space-charge region, or depletion region, forms at the $p^{+}\\text{-}n$ junction and extends into the $n$-drift region. The problem specifies that at the blocking voltage $V_{B}$, this depletion region extends precisely across the entire width $w$ of the drift region. This is the condition for a punch-through diode.\n\nThe analysis begins with Poisson's equation for the one-dimensional case in the $n$-type drift region, which has a uniform donor doping concentration of $N_{D}$. Assuming complete ionization, the space charge density $\\rho$ is constant and given by $\\rho = q N_{D}$. Poisson's equation is:\n$$ \\frac{dE}{dx} = \\frac{\\rho}{\\varepsilon_{s}} = \\frac{q N_{D}}{\\varepsilon_{s}} $$\nHere, $E$ is the electric field, $x$ is the spatial coordinate, $q$ is the elementary charge, and $\\varepsilon_{s}$ is the semiconductor permittivity. Let us define the origin $x=0$ at the metallurgical $p^{+}\\text{-}n$ junction and the end of the drift region at $x=w$.\n\nThe problem states that the electric field profile is to be treated as linear (triangular). This configuration, where the electric field reaches zero exactly at $x=w$, corresponds to the optimal design for minimizing the drift region thickness for a given blocking voltage. Integrating Poisson’s equation gives the electric field profile:\n$$ E(x) = \\int \\frac{q N_{D}}{\\varepsilon_{s}} dx = \\frac{q N_{D}}{\\varepsilon_{s}} x + C_{1} $$\nThe electric field is maximum at the $p^{+}\\text{-}n$ junction ($x=0$) and, for an optimal punch-through design, becomes zero at the $n\\text{-}n^{+}$ junction ($x=w$). Let the magnitude of the peak field at $x=0$ be $E_{\\max}$. The field itself is directed in the negative $x$-direction, so $E(0) = -E_{\\max}$. Applying the boundary condition $E(w) = 0$:\n$$ 0 = \\frac{q N_{D}}{\\varepsilon_{s}} w + E(0) \\implies E(0) = -\\frac{q N_{D} w}{\\varepsilon_{s}} $$\nThus, the magnitude of the peak electric field is:\n$$ E_{\\max} = \\frac{q N_{D} w}{\\varepsilon_{s}} $$\nThis is a fundamental relation for a punch-through structure.\n\nThe problem requires the derivation of relations for $N_{D}$ and $w$. To find these, we must relate them to the blocking voltage $V_{B}$. The voltage across the depletion region is the integral of the electric field from $x=0$ to $x=w$. For a large blocking voltage $V_{B}$, we can neglect the built-in potential, so the applied voltage is approximately the total voltage drop.\n$$ V_{B} = - \\int_{0}^{w} E(x) dx $$\nThe electric field profile can be written as $E(x) = E(0) + \\frac{q N_{D}}{\\varepsilon_{s}} x = -E_{\\max} + \\frac{q N_{D}}{\\varepsilon_{s}} x$. Substituting this into the integral:\n$$ V_{B} = - \\int_{0}^{w} \\left(-E_{\\max} + \\frac{q N_{D}}{\\varepsilon_{s}} x \\right) dx = \\left[ E_{\\max}x - \\frac{q N_{D}}{2\\varepsilon_{s}} x^2 \\right]_{0}^{w} = E_{\\max}w - \\frac{q N_{D} w^2}{2\\varepsilon_{s}} $$\nUsing the relation $E_{\\max} = \\frac{q N_{D} w}{\\varepsilon_{s}}$, we can substitute for the term $\\frac{q N_D}{\\varepsilon_s}$:\n$$ V_{B} = E_{\\max}w - \\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\frac{E_{\\max}}{w}\\right)w^2 = E_{\\max}w - \\frac{1}{2}E_{\\max}w = \\frac{1}{2} E_{\\max} w $$\nThis confirms that the voltage is the area of the triangular electric field profile.\n\nThe design constraint is that at $V = V_{B}$, the peak field is a fraction $\\alpha$ of the critical avalanche field $E_{c}$, i.e., $E_{\\max} = \\alpha E_{c}$. We can now find the expression for the drift region width $w$:\n$$ w = \\frac{2 V_{B}}{E_{\\max}} = \\frac{2 V_{B}}{\\alpha E_{c}} $$\nThis is the required relation for $w$.\nNext, we find the relation for the doping density $N_{D}$ by substituting the expressions for $w$ and $E_{\\max}$ into our first derived equation:\n$$ N_{D} = \\frac{\\varepsilon_{s} E_{\\max}}{q w} = \\frac{\\varepsilon_{s} (\\alpha E_{c})}{q \\left(\\frac{2 V_{B}}{\\alpha E_{c}}\\right)} = \\frac{\\varepsilon_{s} \\alpha^{2} E_{c}^{2}}{2 q V_{B}} $$\nThis is the required relation for $N_{D}$.\n\nThe final task is to determine the areal donor charge density, $q N_{D} w$. We can compute this product using the expressions for $N_{D}$ and $w$ derived above:\n$$ q N_{D} w = q \\left( \\frac{\\varepsilon_{s} \\alpha^{2} E_{c}^{2}}{2 q V_{B}} \\right) \\left( \\frac{2 V_{B}}{\\alpha E_{c}} \\right) $$\nSimplifying this expression by canceling terms ($2$, $q$, $V_B$, one $\\alpha$, and one $E_c$):\n$$ q N_{D} w = \\alpha \\varepsilon_{s} E_{c} $$\nAlternatively, and more directly, this result follows immediately from the relation $E_{\\max} = \\frac{q N_{D} w}{\\varepsilon_{s}}$ and the design constraint $E_{\\max} = \\alpha E_{c}$:\n$$ q N_{D} w = \\varepsilon_{s} E_{\\max} = \\varepsilon_{s} (\\alpha E_{c}) $$\nThis elegant result shows that the required total donor charge per unit area depends only on the material properties ($\\varepsilon_{s}$, $E_{c}$) and the safety factor $\\alpha$, and not on the specific blocking voltage $V_B$.\n\nNow, we will compute the numerical value using the provided parameters for silicon:\n$\\alpha = 0.80$\n$E_{c} = 3.0 \\times 10^{7}$ V/m\n$\\varepsilon_{s} = 11.7 \\varepsilon_{0}$, with $\\varepsilon_{0} = 8.854 \\times 10^{-12}$ F/m\n\nFirst, calculate the permittivity of silicon, $\\varepsilon_{s}$:\n$$ \\varepsilon_{s} = 11.7 \\times 8.854 \\times 10^{-12} \\text{ F/m} \\approx 1.035938 \\times 10^{-10} \\text{ F/m} $$\nNow, substitute the values into the derived expression for the areal charge density:\n$$ q N_{D} w = \\alpha \\varepsilon_{s} E_{c} = (0.80) \\times (11.7 \\times 8.854 \\times 10^{-12} \\text{ F/m}) \\times (3.0 \\times 10^{7} \\text{ V/m}) $$\nPerforming the calculation:\n$$ q N_{D} w = (0.80 \\times 11.7 \\times 3.0) \\times 8.854 \\times 10^{-12} \\times 10^{7} \\text{ C/m}^{2} $$\n$$ q N_{D} w = 28.08 \\times 8.854 \\times 10^{-5} \\text{ C/m}^{2} $$\n$$ q N_{D} w \\approx 248.618 \\times 10^{-5} \\text{ C/m}^{2} = 2.48618 \\times 10^{-3} \\text{ C/m}^{2} $$\nRounding the result to four significant figures as required:\n$$ q N_{D} w = 2.486 \\times 10^{-3} \\text{ C/m}^{2} $$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{2.486 \\times 10^{-3}}$$", "id": "2845684"}, {"introduction": "An ideal rectifier must not only block reverse voltage but also conduct forward current with minimal power loss.

Thus, the general solution is:\n$$ Q(t) = A\\exp(-t/\\tau) - I_{RM}\\tau $$\nWe use the initial condition $Q(0) = I_{F}\\tau$ to find the constant $A$:\n$$ Q(0) = A\\exp(0) - I_{RM}\\tau = A - I_{RM}\\tau = I_{F}\\tau $$\n$$ A = I_{F}\\tau + I_{RM}\\tau = (I_{F} + I_{RM})\\tau $$\nThe specific solution for the stored charge during reverse recovery is:\n$$ Q(t) = (I_{F} + I_{RM})\\tau \\exp(-t/\\tau) - I_{RM}\\tau $$\nWe find $t_{rr}$ by setting $Q(t_{rr}) = 0$:\n$$ 0 = (I_{F} + I_{RM})\\tau \\exp(-t_{rr}/\\tau) - I_{RM}\\tau $$\n$$ I_{RM}\\tau = (I_{F} + I_{RM})\\tau \\exp(-t_{rr}/\\tau) $$\n$$ \\frac{I_{RM}}{I_{F} + I_{RM}} = \\exp(-t_{rr}/\\tau) $$\nTaking the natural logarithm of both sides gives:\n$$ \\ln\\left(\\frac{I_{RM}}{I_{F} + I_{RM}}\\right) = -\\frac{t_{rr}}{\\tau} $$\nSolving for $t_{rr}$:\n$$ t_{rr} = -\\tau \\ln\\left(\\frac{I_{RM}}{I_{F} + I_{RM}}\\right) = \\tau \\ln\\left(\\frac{I_{F} + I_{RM}}{I_{RM}}\\right) = \\tau \\ln\\left(1 + \\frac{I_{F}}{I_{RM}}\\right) $$\nThe reverse-recovery energy $E_{rr}$ is the energy dissipated in the diode during the time interval $0 < t \\le t_{rr}$. During this interval, the current magnitude is $|I(t)| = I_{RM}$ and the voltage magnitude is clamped at $V_{R}$. The instantaneous power is $p(t) = V_{R}I_{RM}$.
