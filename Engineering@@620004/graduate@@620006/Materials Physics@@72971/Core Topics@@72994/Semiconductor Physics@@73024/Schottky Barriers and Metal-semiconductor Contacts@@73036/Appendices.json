A solution will be provided.\n\nThe solution proceeds in three parts as requested: derivation, numerical evaluation, and physical discussion.\n\nPart 1: Derivation of the hole Schottky barrier height, $\\phi_{Bp}$.\nThe energy levels are defined with respect to the vacuum level, $E_{\\mathrm{vac}}$.\nThe metal work function, $\\phi_{M}$, is the energy required to move an electron from the metal's Fermi level, $E_{F,M}$, to the vacuum level.\n$$ \\phi_{M} = E_{\\mathrm{vac}} - E_{F,M} $$\nThe semiconductor electron affinity, $\\chi$, is the energy from the conduction band minimum, $E_{C}$, to the vacuum level.\n$$ \\chi = E_{\\mathrm{vac}} - E_{C} $$\nThe band gap, $E_{g}$, is the energy difference between the conduction and valence band edges.\n$$ E_{g} = E_{C} - E_{V} $$\nFrom the definitions of $\\chi$ and $E_{g}$, we can express the energy of the valence band maximum, $E_{V}$, relative to the vacuum level.\n$$ E_{V} = E_{C} - E_{g} = (E_{\\mathrm{vac}} - \\chi) - E_{g} = E_{\\mathrm{vac}} - \\chi - E_{g} $$\nWhen the metal and semiconductor are brought into contact, thermal equilibrium is established, and their Fermi levels align. The ideal Schottky-Mott limit assumes that there are no interface dipoles or states, which means the vacuum level is continuous across the interface. This implies that the energy differences between band edges and the vacuum level are preserved right up to the interface.\nThe hole Schottky barrier height, $\\phi_{Bp}$, is defined as the energy barrier that holes face when moving from the metal into the semiconductor. This is the energy difference between the metal's Fermi level, $E_{F,M}$, and the semiconductor's valence band maximum, $E_{V}$, at the interface.\n$$ \\phi_{Bp} = E_{F,M} - E_{V} $$\nNote that in equilibrium, $E_{F,M}$ aligns with the semiconductor Fermi level, becoming the single Fermi level $E_{F}$ of the system.\nSubstituting the expressions for $E_{F,M}$ and $E_{V}$ in terms of the vacuum level:\n$$ \\phi_{Bp} = (E_{\\mathrm{vac}} - \\phi_{M}) - (E_{\\mathrm{vac}} - \\chi - E_{g}) $$\nThe vacuum level term, $E_{\\mathrm{vac}}$, cancels out.\n$$ \\phi_{Bp} = -\\phi_{M} + \\chi + E_{g} $$\nThis gives the final expression for the hole Schottky barrier height under the Schottky-Mott approximation:\n$$ \\phi_{Bp} = \\chi + E_{g} - \\phi_{M} $$\n\nPart 2: Numerical evaluation of $\\phi_{Bp}$.\nThe given values are substituted into the derived expression:\n- Electron affinity $\\chi = 4.10\\ \\mathrm{eV}$\n- Band gap $E_{g} = 3.40\\ \\mathrm{eV}$\n- Metal work function $\\phi_{M} = 5.15\\ \\mathrm{eV}$\n$$ \\phi_{Bp} = 4.10\\ \\mathrm{eV} + 3.40\\ \\mathrm{eV} - 5.15\\ \\mathrm{eV} $$\n$$ \\phi_{Bp} = 7.50\\ \\mathrm{eV} - 5.15\\ \\mathrm{eV} $$\n$$ \\phi_{Bp} = 2.35\\ \\mathrm{eV} $$\nThe value is already expressed to three significant figures as required.\n\nPart 3: Discussion of the contact type (rectifying vs. Ohmic).\nThe nature of a metal-semiconductor contact is determined by the size of the energy barrier presented to the majority charge carriers. For a p-type semiconductor, the majority carriers are holes. The relevant barrier is the hole Schottky barrier height, $\\phi_{Bp}$, which we have calculated to be $2.35\\ \\mathrm{eV}$.\n\nAn Ohmic contact is characterized by a very low or zero resistance to current flow, which requires a very small or ideally zero (or even negative) energy barrier for the majority carriers.\nA rectifying contact, or Schottky diode, is characterized by a significant energy barrier that impedes current flow, allowing current to flow preferentially in one bias direction.\n\nTo assess the significance of the barrier, we compare its energy to the characteristic thermal energy, $k_{B}T$, where $k_{B}$ is the Boltzmann constant and $T$ is the absolute temperature. At $T = 300\\ \\mathrm{K}$, the thermal energy is:\n$$ k_{B}T \\approx (8.617 \\times 10^{-5}\\ \\mathrm{eV/K}) \\times (300\\ \\mathrm{K}) \\approx 0.0259\\ \\mathrm{eV} $$\nThe calculated hole barrier height is $\\phi_{Bp} = 2.35\\ \\mathrm{eV}$. The ratio is:\n$$ \\frac{\\phi_{Bp}}{k_{B}T} = \\frac{2.35\\ \\mathrm{eV}}{0.0259\\ \\mathrm{eV}} \\approx 91 $$\nThe barrier is approximately $91$ times the available thermal energy. This is a very substantial barrier. Under the assumption that thermionic emission is the dominant transport mechanism (as stated in the problem, and which is physically correct for a doping of $N_A = 5 \\times 10^{17}\\ \\mathrm{cm}^{-3}$ where tunneling is not significant), the current across the junction is exponentially dependent on $-\\phi_{Bp}/(k_B T)$. A large positive $\\phi_{Bp}$ leads to an extremely small current, and thus a very high resistance at zero bias. This behavior is the defining characteristic of a rectifying contact.\n\nTherefore, based on the large calculated value of the hole Schottky barrier height, the contact is expected to be strongly rectifying, not Ohmic.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{2.35}\n$$", "id": "2786072"}, {"introduction": "While theoretical models provide a starting point, the true properties of a metal-semiconductor contact must be measured.

A complete solution will be provided.\n\nThe total measured resistance $R_{\\text{tot}}$ in a four-terminal measurement between two adjacent contacts is the sum of the resistance of the semiconductor sheet in the gap, $R_{gap}$, and the resistance of the two contacts, $R_C$.\n$$\nR_{\\text{tot}} = R_{gap} + 2R_C\n$$\nThe gap resistance is given by the sheet resistance $R_s$ ($\\Omega$/square) and the geometry of the gap (length $d$, width $W$):\n$$\nR_{gap} = R_s \\frac{d}{W}\n$$\nTo find the contact resistance $R_C$, we must analyze the current flow under the contact. Let $x$ be the coordinate along the contact length, from $x=0$ at the edge of the gap to $x=L_c$. Let $V(x)$ be the potential in the semiconductor sheet relative to the metal contact, and $I(x)$ be the current flowing in the semiconductor sheet.\n\nAccording to Ohm's law applied to a differential element $dx$ of the semiconductor sheet, the voltage drop is:\n$$\ndV(x) = -I(x) dR = -I(x) \\left(\\frac{R_s}{W} dx\\right) \\implies \\frac{dV}{dx} = -\\frac{R_s}{W} I(x)\n$$\nThe current continuity equation states that the change in the sheet current $dI(x)$ must equal the current flowing vertically through the contact interface area $W dx$. This vertical current density is given as $J_c(x) = V(x) / \\rho_c$. The current lost from the sheet is $dI_c = J_c(x) W dx = \\frac{W}{\\rho_c} V(x) dx$. Therefore:\n$$\ndI(x) = -dI_c = -\\frac{W}{\\rho_c} V(x) dx \\implies \\frac{dI}{dx} = -\\frac{W}{\\rho_c} V(x)\n$$\nDifferentiating the first equation with respect to $x$ gives $\\frac{d^2V}{dx^2} = -\\frac{R_s}{W} \\frac{dI}{dx}$. Substituting the expression for $\\frac{dI}{dx}$ from the second equation yields:\n$$\n\\frac{d^2V}{dx^2} = -\\frac{R_s}{W} \\left(-\\frac{W}{\\rho_c} V(x)\\right) = \\frac{R_s}{\\rho_c} V(x)\n$$\nThis gives the required one-dimensional differential equation for the potential $V(x)$:\n$$\n\\frac{d^2V}{dx^2} - \\frac{R_s}{\\rho_c} V(x) = 0\n$$\nWe define the current transfer length $L_T = \\sqrt{\\rho_c / R_s}$, so the equation becomes:\n$$\n\\frac{d^2V}{dx^2} - \\frac{1}{L_T^2} V(x) = 0\n$$\nThe general solution to this second-order ODE is $V(x) = A \\exp(x/L_T) + B \\exp(-x/L_T)$. The current is $I(x) = -\\frac{W}{R_s} \\frac{dV}{dx} = -\\frac{W}{R_s L_T} (A \\exp(x/L_T) - B \\exp(-x/L_T))$.\nThe boundary conditions are: the total current $I_0$ enters the contact at $x=0$, so $I(0)=I_0$; and the contact ends at $x=L_c$, beyond which there is no semiconductor path for the current, so $I(L_c)=0$.\nFrom $I(L_c)=0$: $A \\exp(L_c/L_T) - B \\exp(-L_c/L_T) = 0 \\implies B = A \\exp(2L_c/L_T)$.\nThe total current is $I_0 = I(0) = -\\frac{W}{R_s L_T}(A - B) = -\\frac{W}{R_s L_T}(A - A \\exp(2L_c/L_T)) = \\frac{W A}{R_s L_T}(\\exp(2L_c/L_T) - 1)$.\nThe voltage at the contact edge is $V_0 = V(0) = A+B = A(1+\\exp(2L_c/L_T))$.\nThe resistance of a single contact is $R_C = V_0 / I_0$:\n$$\nR_C = \\frac{A(1+\\exp(2L_c/L_T))}{\\frac{W A}{R_s L_T}(\\exp(2L_c/L_T) - 1)} = \\frac{R_s L_T}{W} \\frac{\\exp(-L_c/L_T)+\\exp(L_c/L_T)}{\\exp(L_c/L_T)-\\exp(-L_c/L_T)} = \\frac{R_s L_T}{W} \\coth\\left(\\frac{L_c}{L_T}\\right)\n$$\nThe total resistance is thus:\n$$\nR_{\\text{tot}}(d) = \\frac{R_s}{W} d + 2 \\frac{R_s L_T}{W} \\coth\\left(\\frac{L_c}{L_T}\\right)\n$$\nThis is a linear relationship between $R_{\\text{tot}}$ and $d$. We extract the slope and intercept from the provided data. The data points are $(10, 67.32)$, $(30, 107.32)$, $(50, 147.32)$, and $(90, 227.32)$, where $d$ is in $\\mu\\text{m}$ and $R_{\\text{tot}}$ is in $\\Omega$.\nThe slope $m$ is $\\frac{\\Delta R_{\\text{tot}}}{\\Delta d} = \\frac{107.32-67.32}{30-10} = \\frac{40}{20} = 2 \\ \\Omega/\\mu\\text{m}$.\nThe slope is $m = R_s/W$.

We can find it using any data point: $2R_C = R_{\\text{tot}}(d) - m \\cdot d$.\nUsing the first data point ($d=10 \\ \\mu\\text{m}$): $2R_C = 67.32 \\ \\Omega - (2 \\ \\Omega/\\mu\\text{m}) \\cdot (10 \\ \\mu\\text{m}) = 47.32 \\ \\Omega$.\nSo, a single contact resistance is $R_C = 23.66 \\ \\Omega$.\nThe problem asks for contact resistance per unit width, $R_c'$:\n$$\nR_c' = R_C \\cdot W = (23.66 \\ \\Omega) \\cdot (100 \\times 10^{-4} \\ \\text{cm}) = 0.2366 \\ \\Omega\\cdot\\text{cm}\n$$\nNext, we determine the specific contact resistivity $\\rho_c$.

The ratio is $L_c / L_T = 100 / 11.83 \\approx 8.45$. Since $L_c/L_T \\gg 1$, the approximation is valid, as $\\coth(8.45) \\approx 1.0000004$, which is very close to $1$.\n\nFinally, we relate $\\rho_c$ to the Schottky barrier height $\\phi_B$.

It is a standard theoretical problem in solid-state physics. We shall proceed with the derivation and solution.\n\nThe minimal specific contact resistivity, $\\rho_{c,\\min}$, is the inverse of the maximal specific contact conductance, $G_{c,\\max}$. This maximum conductance occurs in the ballistic limit at zero temperature ($T=0$) with perfect transmission probability ($T=1$), as stipulated in the problem.\n\nWe begin from the Landauer-Büttiker formula for conductance. For a two-terminal device, the conductance $G$ is given by\n$$G = \\frac{g_s q^2}{h} \\sum_i T_i$$\nwhere $g_s=2$ is the spin degeneracy, $q$ is the elementary charge, $h$ is the Planck constant, and $T_i$ is the transmission probability of the $i$-th transverse transport channel. The problem specifies unit transmission, so $T_i=1$ for all available channels. The total conductance is then proportional to the total number of channels, $N_{ch}$.\n$$G = \\frac{2q^2}{h} N_{ch}$$\nThe number of channels is determined by counting the available quantum states in the plane transverse to the direction of transport. For a contact of area $A$, the number of states in an element of transverse reciprocal space $dk_x dk_y$ is $A \\frac{dk_x dk_y}{(2\\pi)^2}$. The total number of channels is thus the integral over all transverse wavevectors $(k_x, k_y)$ that correspond to propagating states (i.e., states with a real wavevector component $k_z$ in the transport direction, which is the $[001]$ or $z$-direction).\n$$N_{ch} = A \\frac{1}{(2\\pi)^2} \\iint dk_x dk_y = A \\frac{\\mathcal{A}_k}{(2\\pi)^2}$$\nwhere $\\mathcal{A}_k$ is the area in the $k_x-k_y$ plane containing all transverse wavevectors of propagating modes at the Fermi energy, $E_F$. The specific conductance $G_c$ is the conductance per unit area, $G/A$.\n$$G_c = \\frac{2q^2}{h} \\frac{\\mathcal{A}_k}{(2\\pi)^2}$$\nThe total area $\\mathcal{A}_k$ is the sum of contributions from all six equivalent valleys of the silicon conduction band: $\\mathcal{A}_k = \\sum_{\\nu=1}^{6} \\mathcal{A}_k^{(\\nu)}$. We must analyze the contribution from each valley based on its orientation relative to the transport direction $[001]$. The energy dispersion for each valley is an ellipsoid described by the effective mass approximation:\n$$E(\\vec{k}) = \\frac{\\hbar^2}{2} \\left( \\frac{k_1^2}{m_1} + \\frac{k_2^2}{m_2} + \\frac{k_3^2}{m_3} \\right)$$\nwhere $k_i$ are wavevector components along the principal axes of the ellipsoid, and $m_i$ are the corresponding effective masses (one longitudinal $m_l$, two transverse $m_t$).\n\n**1. Valleys with principal axis along $\\pm[001]$ (2 valleys):**\nFor these two valleys, the longitudinal mass $m_l$ is along the transport direction ($z$-axis), and the two transverse masses $m_t$ are in the $x-y$ plane. The energy dispersion is:\n$$E(k_x, k_y, k_z) = \\frac{\\hbar^2}{2m_t} (k_x^2 + k_y^2) + \\frac{\\hbar^2}{2m_l} k_z^2$$\nAt the Fermi energy, $E(k_x, k_y, k_z) = E_F$. For a state to be a propagating mode along the $z$-direction, $k_z$ must be real, which implies $k_z^2 \\ge 0$. This leads to the condition:\n$$\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2m_t} (k_x^2 + k_y^2) \\le E_F \\implies k_x^2 + k_y^2 \\le \\frac{2m_t E_F}{\\hbar^2}$$\nThis inequality defines a circular area in the $k_x-k_y$ plane. The area for a single such valley is $\\mathcal{A}_{k, [001]} = \\pi \\left( \\frac{2m_t E_F}{\\hbar^2} \\right)$.

Valleys with principal axis along $\\pm[100]$ (2 valleys):**\nFor these two valleys, the longitudinal mass $m_l$ is along the $x$-axis, and the transverse masses $m_t$ are along the $y$ and $z$ axes.
