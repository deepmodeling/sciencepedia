Your final answer must consist only of the analytic expressions for $n$ and $p$.", "solution": "The problem statement has been validated and found to be well-posed, scientifically grounded, and internally consistent. It represents a standard exercise in semiconductor physics. We will now proceed with the derivation from first principles as requested.\n\nThe concentration of electrons, $n$, in the conduction band and the concentration of holes, $p$, in the valence band are given in the nondegenerate (Maxwell-Boltzmann) limit by the following fundamental expressions:\n$$n = N_C \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_C - E_F}{k_B T}\\right)$$\n$$p = N_V \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_F - E_V}{k_B T}\\right)$$\nHere, $N_C$ and $N_V$ are the effective densities of states in the conduction and valence bands, respectively, $E_C$ and $E_V$ are the energies of the band edges, $E_F$ is the Fermi level, $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant, and $T$ is the absolute temperature.\n\nFirst, we derive the equilibrium relation between $n$ and $p$. This is achieved by computing the product $np$:\n$$np = \\left(N_C \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_C - E_F}{k_B T}\\right)\\right) \\left(N_V \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_F - E_V}{k_B T}\\right)\\right)$$\n$$np = N_C N_V \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_C - E_F + E_F - E_V}{k_B T}\\right)$$\nThe Fermi level $E_F$ cancels in the exponent, leading to:\n$$np = N_C N_V \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_C - E_V}{k_B T}\\right)$$\nThe energy difference $E_g = E_C - E_V$ is the semiconductor bandgap energy. Therefore, the product becomes:\n$$np = N_C N_V \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_g}{k_B T}\\right)$$\nAt a fixed temperature $T$, the right side of this equation is a constant, as $N_C$, $N_V$, and $E_g$ are material parameters that depend on temperature but not on doping or the Fermi level. This constant is defined as the square of the intrinsic carrier concentration, $n_i^2$. The intrinsic concentration $n_i$ is the concentration of electrons (or holes) in an undoped (intrinsic) semiconductor, where $n = p = n_i$. Thus, we have established the law of mass action for semiconductors:\n$$np = n_i^2$$\nThis is the first required relation.\n\nSecond, we formulate the condition of global charge neutrality. The semiconductor is electrically neutral in its entirety. The total density of positive charge must equal the total density of negative charge. The sources of positive charge are holes (concentration $p$) and ionized donor atoms (concentration $N_D^+$). The sources of negative charge are electrons (concentration $n$) and ionized acceptor atoms (concentration $N_A^-$). The neutrality condition is therefore:\n$$p + N_D^+ = n + N_A^-$$\nThe problem specifies the assumption of complete ionization for the shallow dopants. This implies that every donor atom has lost its electron, and every acceptor atom has gained an electron. Mathematically, this means:\n$$N_D^+ = N_D$$\n$$N_A^- = N_A$$\nwhere $N_D$ and $N_A$ are the total concentrations of donor and acceptor atoms, respectively. Substituting these into the neutrality equation yields the second required relation for a compensated semiconductor with full ionization:\n$$p + N_D = n + N_A$$\n\nThird, we must solve this system of two equations for the two unknowns, $n$ and $p$:\n1. $np = n_i^2$\n2. $p + N_D = n + N_A$\n\nWe can express $p$ from the first equation as $p = \\frac{n_i^2}{n}$ and substitute it into the second equation:\n$$\\frac{n_i^2}{n} + N_D = n + N_A$$\nTo eliminate the fraction, we multiply the entire equation by $n$ (noting that $n \\neq 0$):\n$$n_i^2 + nN_D = n^2 + nN_A$$\nRearranging this into a standard quadratic form, $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$, with $x=n$, gives:\n$$n^2 + n(N_A - N_D) - n_i^2 = 0$$\nThis is a quadratic equation for the electron concentration $n$. We solve it using the quadratic formula, $n = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$, where $a=1$, $b = N_A - N_D$, and $c = -n_i^2$:\n$$n = \\frac{-(N_A - N_D) \\pm \\sqrt{(N_A - N_D)^2 - 4(1)(-n_i^2)}}{2}$$\n$$n = \\frac{N_D - N_A \\pm \\sqrt{(N_D - N_A)^2 + 4n_i^2}}{2}$$\nSince the electron concentration $n$ is a physical quantity, it must be positive. The term under the square root, $\\sqrt{(N_D - N_A)^2 + 4n_i^2}$, is strictly greater than $|N_D - N_A|$. If we choose the negative sign, the numerator $(N_D - N_A) - \\sqrt{(N_D - N_A)^2 + 4n_i^2}$ would be negative, yielding an unphysical negative concentration. Therefore, we must select the positive root:\n$$n = \\frac{N_D - N_A + \\sqrt{(N_D - N_A)^2 + 4n_i^2}}{2}$$\nThis can be written more elegantly as:\n$$n = \\frac{N_D - N_A}{2} + \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{N_D - N_A}{2}\\right)^2 + n_i^2}$$\nTo find the hole concentration $p$, we can follow a symmetrical procedure. From the neutrality equation, we express $n = p + N_D - N_A$. Substituting into the mass-action law $np = n_i^2$:\n$$(p + N_D - N_A)p = n_i^2$$\n$$p^2 + p(N_D - N_A) - n_i^2 = 0$$\nSolving this quadratic equation for $p$ yields:\n$$p = \\frac{-(N_D - N_A) \\pm \\sqrt{(N_D - N_A)^2 - 4(1)(-n_i^2)}}{2}$$\n$$p = \\frac{N_A - N_D \\pm \\sqrt{(N_A - N_D)^2 + 4n_i^2}}{2}$$\nAgain, for $p$ to be a physically meaningful positive quantity, we must take the positive root:\n$$p = \\frac{N_A - N_D + \\sqrt{(N_A - N_D)^2 + 4n_i^2}}{2}$$\nThis can be written as:\n$$p = \\frac{N_A - N_D}{2} + \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{N_A - N_D}{2}\\right)^2 + n_i^2}$$\nThese are the exact, closed-form expressions for the electron and hole concentrations under the given assumptions.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{aligned}\nn = \\frac{N_D - N_A}{2} + \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{N_D - N_A}{2}\\right)^2 + n_i^2} \\\\\np = \\frac{N_A - N_D}{2} + \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{N_A - N_D}{2}\\right)^2 + n_i^2}\n\\end{aligned}\n}\n$$", "id": "2836467"}, {"introduction": "With the general theoretical framework established, we now explore its application in a unique and elegant scenario.
