We begin from the fundamental principle of charge neutrality in a semiconductor at thermal equilibrium. The total positive charge density must equal the total negative charge density. The positive charges are holes, with concentration $p$, and ionized donor impurities, with concentration $N_D^+$. The negative charges are free electrons, with concentration $n$, and ionized acceptor impurities, with concentration $N_A^-$. The charge neutrality condition is therefore expressed as:\n$$p + N_D^+ = n + N_A^-$$\nThe problem specifies that all dopant atoms are fully ionized. This is a common and reasonable assumption for typical dopants in silicon or germanium at room temperature ($T=300\\,\\mathrm{K}$). This simplifies the ionized dopant concentrations to their total concentrations:\n$$N_D^+ = N_D$$\n$$N_A^- = N_A$$\nSubstituting these into the neutrality equation gives:\n$$p + N_D = n + N_A$$\nFor a non-degenerate semiconductor, the equilibrium electron and hole concentrations are related to the intrinsic carrier concentration $n_i$ and the Fermi level $E_F$ relative to the intrinsic Fermi level $E_i$ by the following relations, which are derived from Boltzmann statistics:\n$$n = n_i \\exp\\left(\\frac{E_F - E_i}{k_B T}\\right)$$\n$$p = n_i \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_F - E_i}{k_B T}\\right)$$\nHere, $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant and $T$ is the absolute temperature. An immediate consequence of these two equations is the mass action law, $np = n_i^2$, which holds in thermal equilibrium.\n\nWe can express the hole concentration $p$ in terms of the electron concentration $n$ and the intrinsic concentration $n_i$ as $p = n_i^2/n$. Substituting this into the charge neutrality equation $p - n = N_A - N_D$ yields:\n$$\\frac{n_i^2}{n} - n = N_A - N_D$$\nMultiplying by $n$ and rearranging the terms gives a quadratic equation for the electron concentration $n$:\n$$n^2 - (N_D - N_A)n - n_i^2 = 0$$\nThis is an exact equation for the electron concentration under the given assumptions. We solve this quadratic equation for $n$ using the standard formula:\n$$n = \\frac{-( -(N_D - N_A) ) \\pm \\sqrt{( -(N_D - N_A) )^2 - 4(1)(-n_i^2)}}{2(1)}$$\n$$n = \\frac{(N_D - N_A) \\pm \\sqrt{(N_D - N_A)^2 + 4n_i^2}}{2}$$\nSince the electron concentration $n$ must be a positive physical quantity, we must select the appropriate sign. The term $\\sqrt{(N_D - N_A)^2 + 4n_i^2}$ is always greater than $|N_D - N_A|$. Choosing the negative sign would result in a negative value for $n$, which is unphysical. Thus, we must take the positive root:\n$$n = \\frac{(N_D - N_A) + \\sqrt{(N_D - N_A)^2 + 4n_i^2}}{2}$$\nNow, we relate this expression for $n$ back to the Fermi level.
