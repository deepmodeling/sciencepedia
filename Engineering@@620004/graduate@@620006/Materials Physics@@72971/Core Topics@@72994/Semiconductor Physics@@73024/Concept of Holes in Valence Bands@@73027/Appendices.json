It is based on standard, albeit simplified, models from semiconductor physics and contains no contradictions or ambiguities. The assumptions provided are sufficient to derive the requested quantities. Therefore, a solution will be provided.\n\nThe problem requires the derivation of two quantities: the ratio of hole populations in the heavy-hole and light-hole bands, and a transport effective mass. This will be approached in two parts, starting from the fundamental definitions as instructed.\n\nPart 1: Derivation of the hole population ratio $p_{hh}/p_{lh}$.\n\nThe concentration of holes, $p_i$, in a given subband $i$ (where $i$ represents either heavy holes, $hh$, or light holes, $lh$) is determined by integrating the product of the density of states per unit volume, $g_i(E)$, and the probability of a state at energy $E$ being occupied by a hole, $f_h(E)$. The integration is performed over all energies in the band.\n$$\np_i = \\int_{-\\infty}^{E_v} g_i(E) f_h(E) \\, dE\n$$\nThe problem specifies that each subband is isotropic and parabolic. For a three-dimensional system with spin degeneracy, the density of states for holes with effective mass $m_i$ near a band edge $E_v$ is given by:\n$$\ng_i(E) = \\frac{\\sqrt{2} (m_i)^{3/2}}{\\pi^2 \\hbar^3} \\sqrt{E_v - E}\n$$\nHere, $\\hbar$ is the reduced Planck constant. This expression is valid for $E \\le E_v$.\n\nThe hole distribution function $f_h(E)$ is the probability that a state at energy $E$ is empty of an electron, which is $1$ minus the Fermi-Dirac distribution $f_e(E)$:\n$$\nf_h(E) = 1 - f_e(E) = 1 - \\frac{1}{\\exp\\left(\\frac{E-E_F}{k_B T}\\right) + 1} = \\frac{1}{\\exp\\left(\\frac{E_F-E}{k_B T}\\right) + 1}\n$$\nThe problem states that the hole gas is non-degenerate, with the Fermi level $E_F$ satisfying $E_v - E_F \\gg k_B T$. For any energy $E$ in the valence band, $E \\le E_v$. This implies that $E_F - E = (E_F - E_v) + (E_v - E)$ is a large negative value in units of $k_B T$. Consequently, the term $\\exp\\left(\\frac{E_F-E}{k_B T}\\right) \\ll 1$. The distribution function simplifies to the Maxwell-Boltzmann approximation:\n$$\nf_h(E) \\approx \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_F-E}{k_B T}\\right) = \\exp\\left(\\frac{E-E_F}{k_B T}\\right)\n$$\nWe substitute the expressions for $g_i(E)$ and $f_h(E)$ into the integral for $p_i$:\n$$\np_i = \\int_{-\\infty}^{E_v} \\left( \\frac{\\sqrt{2} (m_i)^{3/2}}{\\pi^2 \\hbar^3} \\sqrt{E_v - E} \\right) \\exp\\left(\\frac{E-E_F}{k_B T}\\right) \\, dE\n$$\nWe can factor out terms that are constant with respect to the integration variable $E$:\n$$\np_i = \\frac{\\sqrt{2} (m_i)^{3/2}}{\\pi^2 \\hbar^3} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_F}{k_B T}\\right) \\int_{-\\infty}^{E_v} \\sqrt{E_v - E} \\exp\\left(\\frac{E}{k_B T}\\right) \\, dE\n$$\nTo evaluate the integral, we perform a change of variables. Let $x = \\frac{E_v - E}{k_B T}$. This implies $E = E_v - x k_B T$, and $dE = -k_B T \\, dx$. The integration limits transform as follows: as $E \\to E_v$, $x \\to 0$; as $E \\to -\\infty$, $x \\to \\infty$. The integral becomes:\n$$\n\\int_{\\infty}^{0} \\sqrt{x k_B T} \\exp\\left(\\frac{E_v - x k_B T}{k_B T}\\right) (-k_B T \\, dx) = \\exp\\left(\\frac{E_v}{k_B T}\\right) (k_B T)^{3/2} \\int_{0}^{\\infty} x^{1/2} e^{-x} \\, dx\n$$\nThe remaining integral is the Gamma function $\\Gamma(z) = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} t^{z-1} e^{-t} \\, dt$ with $z = \\frac{3}{2}$. We have $\\Gamma(\\frac{3}{2}) = \\frac{1}{2}\\Gamma(\\frac{1}{2}) = \\frac{\\sqrt{\\pi}}{2}$.\nSubstituting this result, the hole concentration $p_i$ is:\n$$\np_i = \\frac{\\sqrt{2} (m_i)^{3/2}}{\\pi^2 \\hbar^3} \\exp\\left(\\frac{E_v-E_F}{k_B T}\\right) (k_B T)^{3/2} \\frac{\\sqrt{\\pi}}{2}\n$$\nThis simplifies to the standard result for a non-degenerate hole gas, often written as $p_i = N_{v,i} \\exp\\left(\\frac{E_v - E_F}{k_B T}\\right)$, where $N_{v,i}$ is the effective density of states for band $i$:\n$$\np_i = 2 \\left(\\frac{2\\pi m_i k_B T}{h^2}\\right)^{3/2} \\exp\\left(\\frac{E_v - E_F}{k_B T}\\right)\n$$\nFor the two subbands, heavy-hole ($hh$) and light-hole ($lh$), we have:\n$$\np_{hh} = 2 \\left(\\frac{2\\pi m_{hh} k_B T}{h^2}\\right)^{3/2} \\exp\\left(\\frac{E_v - E_F}{k_B T}\\right)\n$$\n$$\np_{lh} = 2 \\left(\\frac{2\\pi m_{lh} k_B T}{h^2}\\right)^{3/2} \\exp\\left(\\frac{E_v - E_F}{k_B T}\\right)\n$$\nThe exponential term and all constants are identical for both hole types because the band edges are degenerate ($E_v$ is common) and they exist in the same thermal environment ($T$, $E_F$).

The total conductivity is the sum of the conductivities of the two hole species, $\\sigma = \\sigma_{hh} + \\sigma_{lh}$.\nThe definition is:\n$$\n\\sigma \\equiv e\\left(p_{hh}\\mu_{hh}+p_{lh}\\mu_{lh}\\right) \\equiv \\frac{e^{2}\\tau}{m_{tr}}p\n$$\nwhere $p = p_{hh} + p_{lh}$ is the total hole concentration, $e$ is the elementary charge, and $\\tau$ is the common relaxation time.\nFrom the relaxation-time approximation (a simplified Drude model), the mobility $\\mu_i$ for a carrier of charge $e$, mass $m_i$, and relaxation time $\\tau$ is given by $\\mu_i = \\frac{e\\tau}{m_i}$. The problem states that the conductivity mass is equal to the density-of-states mass, so we use $m_{hh}$ and $m_{lh}$.\n$$\n\\mu_{hh} = \\frac{e\\tau}{m_{hh}} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\mu_{lh} = \\frac{e\\tau}{m_{lh}}\n$$\nSubstituting these into the left-hand side of the defining equation for $\\sigma$:\n$$\n\\sigma = e\\left(p_{hh}\\frac{e\\tau}{m_{hh}} + p_{lh}\\frac{e\\tau}{m_{lh}}\\right) = e^2\\tau\\left(\\frac{p_{hh}}{m_{hh}} + \\frac{p_{lh}}{m_{lh}}\\right)\n$$\nNow, we equate this with the right-hand side of the definition:\n$$\ne^2\\tau\\left(\\frac{p_{hh}}{m_{hh}} + \\frac{p_{lh}}{m_{lh}}\\right) = \\frac{e^2\\tau}{m_{tr}}(p_{hh} + p_{lh})\n$$\nThe common factor $e^2\\tau$ cancels, provided it is non-zero. This leaves:\n$$\n\\frac{p_{hh}}{m_{hh}} + \\frac{p_{lh}}{m_{lh}} = \\frac{p_{hh} + p_{lh}}{m_{tr}}\n$$\nWe solve this equation for $m_{tr}$:\n$$\nm_{tr} = \\frac{p_{hh} + p_{lh}}{\\frac{p_{hh}}{m_{hh}} + \\frac{p_{lh}}{m_{lh}}}\n$$\nThis expression shows that $m_{tr}$ is a form of weighted average mass. To express it solely in terms of $m_{hh}$ and $m_{lh}$, we must use the relationship between the hole populations and their masses derived in Part 1. We found that $p_i \\propto (m_i)^{3/2}$. Let $p_{hh} = C(m_{hh})^{3/2}$ and $p_{lh} = C(m_{lh})^{3/2}$ for some constant $C$.\nSubstituting these into the expression for $m_{tr}$:\n$$\nm_{tr} = \\frac{C(m_{hh})^{3/2} + C(m_{lh})^{3/2}}{\\frac{C(m_{hh})^{3/2}}{m_{hh}} + \\frac{C(m_{lh})^{3/2}}{m_{lh}}}\n$$\nThe constant $C$ cancels from the numerator and denominator:\n$$\nm_{tr} = \\frac{(m_{hh})^{3/2} + (m_{lh})^{3/2}}{(m_{hh})^{3/2-1} + (m_{lh})^{3/2-1}} = \\frac{m_{hh}^{3/2} + m_{lh}^{3/2}}{m_{hh}^{1/2} + m_{lh}^{1/2}}\n$$\nThis is the final expression for the transport effective mass, expressed, as required, in terms of only the heavy-hole and light-hole effective masses. This mass is also known as the conductivity effective mass for the combined hole gas.\n\nThe two final results are thus the ratio of populations and the expression for the transport mass.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} \\left(\\frac{m_{hh}}{m_{lh}}\\right)^{3/2}  \\frac{m_{hh}^{3/2} + m_{lh}^{3/2}}{m_{hh}^{1/2} + m_{lh}^{1/2}} \\end{pmatrix}}\n$$", "id": "2810494"}, {"introduction": "Moving beyond the equilibrium state, the functionality of most semiconductor devices—from solar cells to transistors—hinges on the behavior of non-equilibrium carrier populations.

We begin with the one-dimensional steady-state continuity equation for holes.\n\nThe general continuity equation for holes in one dimension is:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial t} = G - R - \\frac{1}{q} \\frac{\\partial J_{p}}{\\partial x} $$\nHere, $p$ is the total hole concentration, $t$ is time, $G$ is the generation rate, $R$ is the recombination rate, $q$ is the elementary charge, and $J_{p}$ is the hole current density.\n\nWe apply the conditions given in the problem statement:\n1.  **Steady-state**: The system is in a steady state, so all time derivatives are zero. $\\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial t} = 0$.\n2.  **No bulk generation**: $G = 0$ for $x > 0$.\n3.  **Linear recombination**: The net recombination rate is given as a linear function of the excess hole concentration, $\\Delta p(x)$, where $\\Delta p(x) = p(x) - p_{0}$ and $p_{0}$ is the uniform equilibrium hole concentration.

The concentration is given by the integral of the density of states multiplied by the distribution function, which for a nondegenerate gas is:\n$$p = N_V \\exp\\left(\\frac{\\mu_p}{k_B T}\\right)$$\nwhere $N_V$ is the effective density of states in the valence band:\n$$N_V = 2\\left(\\frac{m_h^* k_B T}{2\\pi \\hbar^2}\\right)^{3/2}$$\nFrom the relation for $p$, we solve for $\\mu_p$:\n$$\\frac{\\mu_p}{k_B T} = \\ln\\left(\\frac{p}{N_V}\\right) \\implies \\mu_p = k_B T \\ln\\left(\\frac{p}{N_V}\\right)$$\nSubstituting this expression for $\\mu_p$ into our formula for $\\Pi_p$:\n$$\\Pi_p = \\frac{1}{e} \\left( \\frac{5}{2} k_B T - k_B T \\ln\\left(\\frac{p}{N_V}\\right) \\right) = \\frac{k_B T}{e} \\left( \\frac{5}{2} - \\ln\\left(\\frac{p}{N_V}\\right) \\right)$$\nThis can be written as:\n$$\\Pi_p = \\frac{k_B T}{e} \\left( \\frac{5}{2} + \\ln\\left(\\frac{N_V}{p}\\right) \\right)$$\nNow we can compute the numerical value using the provided data:\n$T = 300\\,\\mathrm{K}$\n$p = 1.0 \\times 10^{16}\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-3}$\n$N_V = 1.04 \\times 10^{19}\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-3}$\n$e = 1.602176634 \\times 10^{-19}\\,\\mathrm{C}$\n$k_B = 1.380649 \\times 10^{-23}\\,\\mathrm{J\\,K^{-1}}$\n\nFirst, we calculate the thermal voltage $k_B T/e$:\n$$\\frac{k_B T}{e} = \\frac{(1.380649 \\times 10^{-23}\\,\\mathrm{J\\,K^{-1}}) \\times (300\\,\\mathrm{K})}{1.602176634 \\times 10^{-19}\\,\\mathrm{C}} \\approx 0.025852\\,\\mathrm{V}$$\nNext, we calculate the argument of the logarithm:\n$$\\frac{N_V}{p} = \\frac{1.04 \\times 10^{19}\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-3}}{1.0 \\times 10^{16}\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-3}} = 1040$$\nThe natural logarithm is $\\ln(1040) \\approx 6.947$.\nSubstituting these values into the expression for $\\Pi_p$:\n$$\\Pi_p \\approx (0.025852\\,\\mathrm{V}) \\left( 2.5 + 6.947 \\right) = (0.025852\\,\\mathrm{V}) \\times (9.447) \\approx 0.24424\\,\\mathrm{V}$$\nRounding to three significant figures, the Peltier coefficient is $0.244\\,\\mathrm{V}$.\n\nFinally, we address the physical meaning of the Peltier coefficient. Throughout this derivation, we have treated the hole as a quasiparticle with positive charge $q=+e$. The Peltier coefficient $\\Pi_p$ is defined as the heat current density per unit electric current density, $\\Pi_p = J_Q/J$, under isothermal conditions. Therefore, it represents the amount of heat energy transported per unit of charge. The quantity $e \\Pi_p$ is the average heat transported per moving hole. Our derived expression $e \\Pi_p = (\\frac{5}{2} k_B T - \\mu_p)$ shows that this heat consists of two components. The term $\\frac{5}{2} k_B T$ is the average kinetic energy of the holes that contribute to the current, which is larger than the thermal average kinetic energy of $\\frac{3}{2} k_B T$ because higher-energy holes are more mobile and contribute disproportionately to the current. The term $-\\mu_p$ is the potential energy required to create a hole relative to the chemical potential. Therefore, the Peltier coefficient represents the average transported thermal energy of a charge carrier relative to the chemical potential, divided by its charge.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.244}$$", "id": "2810452"}]}
