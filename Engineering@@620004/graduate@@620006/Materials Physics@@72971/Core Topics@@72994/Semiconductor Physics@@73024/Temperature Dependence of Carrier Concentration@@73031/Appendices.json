It represents a standard calculation in semiconductor physics and can be solved using fundamental principles. We proceed with the solution.\n\nThe starting point for analyzing carrier concentrations in a semiconductor is the principle of charge neutrality. For a semiconductor doped with donors (concentration $N_D$) and acceptors (concentration $N_A$), the equation is:\n$$p + N_{D}^{+} = n + N_{A}^{-}$$\nwhere $n$ is the free-electron concentration, $p$ is the hole concentration, $N_{D}^{+}$ is the concentration of ionized donors, and $N_{A}^{-}$ is the concentration of ionized acceptors.\n\nThe problem specifies an uncompensated $n$-type silicon crystal with no acceptors, which implies $N_{A} = 0$ and thus $N_{A}^{-} = 0$. Furthermore, for an $n$-type material in the specified temperature regimes (freeze-out and extrinsic), the hole concentration is negligible compared to the electron concentration, so we can approximate $p \\approx 0$. Applying these conditions simplifies the charge neutrality equation to:\n$$n \\approx N_{D}^{+}$$\n\nNext, we must express $n$ and $N_{D}^{+}$ in terms of fundamental parameters.\nThe free-electron concentration, $n$, in a nondegenerate semiconductor is given by the Maxwell-Boltzmann approximation:\n$$n = N_{C}(T) \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_{C} - E_{F}}{k_{B} T}\\right)$$\nwhere $N_{C}(T)$ is the effective density of states in the conduction band, $E_{C}$ is the conduction-band edge energy, $E_{F}$ is the Fermi level, $k_{B}$ is the Boltzmann constant, and $T$ is the absolute temperature. The temperature dependence of $N_{C}(T)$ is given as $N_{C}(T) = N_{C0}\\,(T/300\\,\\mathrm{K})^{3/2}$.\n\nThe concentration of ionized donors, $N_{D}^{+}$, is given by the total donor concentration $N_D$ multiplied by the probability that a donor state is unoccupied (ionized). Using Fermi-Dirac statistics for the donor level at energy $E_{D}$ with a degeneracy factor $g_{D}$:\n$$N_{D}^{+} = N_{D} \\left(1 - f_{D}(E_{D})\\right) = N_{D} \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{1}{g_{D}} \\exp\\left(\\frac{E_{D} - E_{F}}{k_{B} T}\\right)}\\right)$$\nThis simplifies to:\n$$N_{D}^{+} = \\frac{N_{D}}{1 + g_{D} \\exp\\left(\\frac{E_{F} - E_{D}}{k_{B} T}\\right)}$$\n\nWe now substitute these expressions for $n$ and $N_{D}^{+}$ into the simplified charge neutrality equation, $n = N_{D}^{+}$:\n$$n = \\frac{N_{D}}{1 + g_{D} \\exp\\left(\\frac{E_{F} - E_{D}}{k_{B} T}\\right)}$$\nTo obtain an equation relating $n$ and $T$ directly, we must eliminate the Fermi level, $E_{F}$. From the expression for $n$, we can write:\n$$\\exp\\left(\\frac{E_{F}}{k_{B} T}\\right) = \\frac{n}{N_{C}(T)} \\exp\\left(\\frac{E_{C}}{k_{B} T}\\right)$$\nSubstituting this into the term $\\exp\\left(\\frac{E_{F} - E_{D}}{k_{B} T}\\right)$:\n$$\\exp\\left(\\frac{E_{F} - E_{D}}{k_{B} T}\\right) = \\exp\\left(\\frac{E_{F}}{k_{B} T}\\right) \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_{D}}{k_{B} T}\\right) = \\left(\\frac{n}{N_{C}(T)} \\exp\\left(\\frac{E_{C}}{k_{B} T}\\right)\\right) \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_{D}}{k_{B} T}\\right) = \\frac{n}{N_{C}(T)} \\exp\\left(\\frac{E_{C} - E_{D}}{k_{B} T}\\right)$$\nLet the donor ionization energy be $\\Delta E_{D} = E_{C} - E_{D}$.

We substitute this condition into the equation:\n$$\\frac{N_{D}}{2} = \\frac{N_{D}}{1 + g_{D} \\frac{N_{D}/2}{N_{C}(T_{1/2})} \\exp\\left(\\frac{\\Delta E_{D}}{k_{B} T_{1/2}}\\right)}$$\nDividing both sides by $N_{D}$ and taking the reciprocal gives:\n$$2 = 1 + g_{D} \\frac{N_{D}}{2 N_{C}(T_{1/2})} \\exp\\left(\\frac{\\Delta E_{D}}{k_{B} T_{1/2}}\\right)$$\n$$1 = g_{D} \\frac{N_{D}}{2 N_{C}(T_{1/2})} \\exp\\left(\\frac{\\Delta E_{D}}{k_{B} T_{1/2}}\\right)$$\nRearranging to solve for the exponential term, we find:\n$$\\exp\\left(\\frac{\\Delta E_{D}}{k_{B} T_{1/2}}\\right) = \\frac{2 N_{C}(T_{1/2})}{g_{D} N_{D}}$$\nWe now substitute the expression for $N_{C}(T_{1/2}) = N_{C0}\\,(T_{1/2}/300\\,\\mathrm{K})^{3/2}$:\n$$\\exp\\left(\\frac{\\Delta E_{D}}{k_{B} T_{1/2}}\\right) = \\frac{2 N_{C0}}{g_{D} N_{D}} \\left(\\frac{T_{1/2}}{300}\\right)^{3/2}$$\nThis is a transcendental equation for $T_{1/2}$.

If no bracket is immediately found, the method should expand the bracket until a sign change is detected over an interval within a practical upper limit.\n- Output each $T^\\ast$ in $\\mathrm{K}$ as a floating-point number rounded to three decimal places.\n\nTest suite and input specification:\n- Use the fixed donor concentration $N_D = 10^{16}\\ \\mathrm{cm^{-3}}$.\n- Evaluate the compensation ratios $K \\in \\{\\,0.0,\\ 0.1,\\ 0.5,\\ 0.9,\\ 1.0,\\ 2.0\\,\\}$.\n- For each $K$, compute $T^\\ast$ according to the definition above.\n- The required final output format is a single line containing a comma-separated list enclosed in square brackets, in the same order as the test suite. For example, an output of the form $[x_1,x_2,\\dots,x_6]$ where each $x_i$ is the rounded floating-point value of $T^\\ast$ in $\\mathrm{K}$.\n\nYour program must produce exactly one line in this format and no other text. All temperatures must be reported in $\\mathrm{K}$, rounded to three decimal places.", "solution": "The problem presented is a standard exercise in semiconductor physics and is scientifically sound, well-posed, and contains all necessary information for its resolution. It is therefore deemed valid. The task is to compute the extrinsic-to-intrinsic transition temperature, $T^\\ast$, for a compensated silicon sample under specified conditions. This temperature is defined as the smallest positive solution to the equation\n$$\nn_i(T^\\ast) = |N_D - N_A|,\n$$\nwhere $n_i(T)$ is the intrinsic carrier concentration, $N_D$ is the donor concentration, and $N_A$ is the acceptor concentration.\n\nThe analysis is founded on the principles of charge neutrality and the law of mass action in a non-degenerate semiconductor described by Maxwell-Boltzmann statistics. The intrinsic carrier concentration is given by the relation:\n$$\nn_i(T) = \\sqrt{N_c(T) N_v(T)} \\exp \\left( - \\frac{E_g(T)}{2 k_B T} \\right)\n$$\nwhere $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant, $T$ is the absolute temperature, $E_g(T)$ is the temperature-dependent band gap, and $N_c(T)$ and $N_v(T)$ are the effective densities of states in the conduction and valence bands, respectively.\n\nThe temperature dependence of the band gap for silicon is modeled by the Varshni relation:\n$$\nE_g(T) = E_g(0) - \\frac{\\alpha T^2}{T + \\beta}\n$$\nThe effective densities of states are given by:\n$$\nN_c(T) = 2 \\left(\\frac{2\\pi m_e^\\ast k_B T}{h^2}\\right)^{3/2}\n$$\n$$\nN_v(T) = 2 \\left(\\frac{2\\pi m_h^\\ast k_B T}{h^2}\\right)^{3/2}\n$$\nHere, $h$ is the Planck constant, and $m_e^\\ast$ and $m_h^\\ast$ are the density-of-states effective masses for electrons and holes.\n\nThe provided parameters are:\n- $E_g(0) = 1.17\\ \\mathrm{eV}$\n- $\\alpha = 4.73 \\times 10^{-4}\\ \\mathrm{eV/K}$\n- $\\beta = 636\\ \\mathrm{K}$\n- $m_e^\\ast = 1.08\\, m_0$\n- $m_h^\\ast = 0.81\\, m_0$\n- $m_0 = 9.1093837015 \\times 10^{-31}\\ \\mathrm{kg}$\n- $h = 6.62607015 \\times 10^{-34}\\ \\mathrm{J \\cdot s}$\n- $k_B = 1.380649 \\times 10^{-23}\\ \\mathrm{J/K}$\n\nA critical step in the implementation is the consistent management of units. The fundamental constants are provided in SI units, while carrier concentrations are required in $\\mathrm{cm^{-3}}$ and band gap energy in $\\mathrm{eV}$.\nThe expressions for $N_c(T)$ and $N_v(T)$, when evaluated with the constants in SI units, yield results in $\\mathrm{m^{-3}}$. A conversion factor of $10^{-6}$ is required to transform these values to $\\mathrm{cm^{-3}}$, since $1\\ \\mathrm{m^{-3}} = 10^{-6}\\ \\mathrm{cm^{-3}}$.\nThe argument of the exponential function, $-E_g(T)/(2k_B T)$, must be dimensionless. As $E_g(T)$ is computed in $\\mathrm{eV}$ and $k_B T$ in Joules, the band gap energy must be converted to Joules by multiplying by the elementary charge, $e \\approx 1.602176634 \\times 10^{-19}\\ \\mathrm{J/eV}$.\n\nThe problem reduces to finding the root of the function $f(T) = n_i(T) - |N_D - N_A|$. The net dopant concentration is given by $|N_D - N_A| = |N_D(1 - K)|$, where $K = N_A/N_D$ is the compensation ratio.\n\nFor a non-zero net dopant concentration, the function $f(T)$ has the following properties:\n- $f(T) \\to -|N_D - N_A|$ as $T \\to 0^+$, because $n_i(T) \\to 0$.\n- $f(T)$ is a monotonically increasing function for $T > 0$, as $n_i(T)$ increases with temperature.\n- $f(T) \\to \\infty$ as $T \\to \\infty$.\nThese properties guarantee the existence of a unique positive root $T^\\ast$. This root can be found efficiently using a numerical root-finding algorithm, such as the Brent-Dekker method (`brentq` in the SciPy library), which requires an interval $[T_{low}, T_{high}]$ where $f(T_{low})$ and $f(T_{high})$ have opposite signs. A suitable initial search interval, for example $[1\\ \\mathrm{K}, 1000\\ \\mathrm{K}]$, can be established. Given the function's monotonicity, if $f(T_{high})$ is not positive, the upper bound must be increased until a sign change isbracketed.\n\nIn the special case where $K=1$, the net dopant concentration $|N_D-N_A|$ is zero. The problem statement provides the convention that $T^\\ast = 0.0\\ \\mathrm{K}$ in this scenario, which is physically coherent as an ideal, perfectly compensated semiconductor behaves intrinsically at any temperature.\n\nThe computational procedure is as follows:\n1. Define all physical and material constants, including the elementary charge for unit conversion.\n2. Implement functions to calculate $E_g(T)$ in $\\mathrm{eV}$, and $N_c(T)$ and $N_v(T)$ in $\\mathrm{cm^{-3}}$.\n3. Implement a function for $n_i(T)$ in $\\mathrm{cm^{-3}}$, which internally calls the functions from step 2 and correctly handles the energy unit conversion in the exponential term.\n4. For each specified compensation ratio $K$, calculate the target net doping density, $|N_D(1-K)|$.\n5. If $K=1$, the result is $0.0$. Otherwise, define the objective function $f(T) = n_i(T) - |N_D(1-K)|$.\n6. Use a numerical solver to find the root of $f(T)=0$ within a dynamically adjusted bracket to ensure convergence.\n7. Format the resulting temperatures $T^\\ast$ as floating-point numbers rounded to three decimal places and present them in the specified list format.\nThis structured approach ensures a correct and robust solution to the posed problem.", "answer": "```python\n# The complete and runnable Python 3 code goes here.\n# Imports must adhere to the specified execution environment.\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy.optimize import brentq\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves for the extrinsic-to-intrinsic transition temperature T* in compensated Silicon.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Define physical and material constants\n    CONSTANTS = {\n        'e': 1.602176634e-19,      # Elementary charge [J/eV]\n        'm0': 9.1093837015e-31,    # Electron rest mass [kg]\n        'h': 6.62607015e-34,       # Planck constant [J*s]\n        'kB': 1.380649e-23,        # Boltzmann constant [J/K]\n        'Eg0': 1.17,               # Band gap at 0 K [eV]\n        'alpha': 4.73e-4,          # Varshni parameter alpha [eV/K]\n        'beta': 636.0,             # Varshni parameter beta [K]\n        'me_eff_ratio': 1.08,      # Electron DOS effective mass ratio\n        'mh_eff_ratio': 0.81,      # Hole DOS effective mass ratio\n    }\n    \n    # Calculate effective masses in kg\n    m_e_star = CONSTANTS['me_eff_ratio'] * CONSTANTS['m0']\n    m_h_star = CONSTANTS['mh_eff_ratio'] * CONSTANTS['m0']\n\n    def E_g(T, consts):\n        \"\"\"\n        Calculates the temperature-dependent band gap using the Varshni relation.\n        Args:\n            T (float): Temperature in Kelvin.\n            consts (dict): Dictionary of constants.\n        Returns:\n            float: Band gap Eg in eV.\n        \"\"\"\n        return consts['Eg0'] - (consts['alpha'] * T**2) / (T + consts['beta'])\n\n    def N_c(T, consts):\n        \"\"\"\n        Calculates the effective density of states in the conduction band.\n        Args:\n            T (float): Temperature in Kelvin.\n            consts (dict): Dictionary of constants.\n        Returns:\n            float: Nc in cm^-3.\n        \"\"\"\n        # Calculate in SI units (m^-3) first\n        term = (2 * np.pi * m_e_star * consts['kB'] * T) / (consts['h']**2)\n        nc_si = 2 * (term**1.5)\n        # Convert from m^-3 to cm^-3\n        return nc_si * 1e-6\n\n    def N_v(T, consts):\n        \"\"\"\n        Calculates the effective density of states in the valence band.\n        Args:\n            T (float): Temperature in Kelvin.\n            consts (dict): Dictionary of constants.\n        Returns:\n            float: Nv in cm^-3.\n        \"\"\"\n        # Calculate in SI units (m^-3) first\n        term = (2 * np.pi * m_h_star * consts['kB'] * T) / (consts['h']**2)\n        nv_si = 2 * (term**1.5)\n        # Convert from m^-3 to cm^-3\n        return nv_si * 1e-6\n\n    def n_i(T, consts):\n        \"\"\"\n        Calculates the intrinsic carrier concentration.\n        Args:\n            T (float): Temperature in Kelvin.\n            consts (dict): Dictionary of constants.\n        Returns:\n            float: ni in cm^-3.\n        \"\"\"\n        if T <= 0:\n            return 0.0\n        \n        nc_val = N_c(T, consts)\n        nv_val = N_v(T, consts)\n        eg_val_eV = E_g(T, consts)\n        \n        # Convert Eg from eV to Joules for the exponential argument\n        eg_val_J = eg_val_eV * consts['e']\n        \n        exponent = -eg_val_J / (2 * consts['kB'] * T)\n        \n        return np.sqrt(nc_val * nv_val) * np.exp(exponent)\n\n    # Test suite parameters\n    N_D = 1e16  # Donor concentration in cm^-3\n    K_values = [0.0, 0.1, 0.5, 0.9, 1.0, 2.0]\n    \n    test_cases = [(N_D, K) for K in K_values]\n\n    results = []\n    \n    for case in test_cases:\n        nd_case, k_case = case\n        \n        # Handle the special case where K = 1 (perfect compensation)\n        if k_case == 1.0:\n            results.append(0.0)\n            continue\n            \n        N_A = k_case * nd_case\n        n_net = abs(nd_case - N_A)\n\n        # Define the function whose root we want to find: f(T) = n_i(T) - n_net\n        def residual(T):\n            return n_i(T, CONSTANTS) - n_net\n\n        # Set up a robust bracketing strategy for the root finder\n        T_low = 1.0  # Lower bound for temperature search\n        T_high = 300.0  # Initial upper bound\n        \n        # Ensure the upper bound brackets the root by expanding if necessary\n        # The residual is monotonically increasing with T.\n        # f(T_low) will be negative.
