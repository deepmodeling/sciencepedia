The data provided are consistent and sufficient for the tasks.\n\nThe solution is partitioned into two tasks as specified.\n\n**Task 1: Derivation of the Charge Transition Level Shift**\n\nThe formation energy of a defect $X$ in charge state $q$ is a function of the Fermi level $E_{F}$. When $E_F$ is referenced to the valence-band maximum (VBM), this relationship is given by:\n$$E_{f}(X^q; E_{F}) = E_{f}(X^q; E_{F}=0) + qE_{F}$$\nwhere $E_{f}(X^q; E_{F}=0)$ is the formation energy at the VBM.

The corresponding transition level, $\\varepsilon_{D}$, is:\n$$\\varepsilon_{D} \\equiv \\varepsilon(D^{+1}/D^0) = \\frac{E_{f}(D^0; 0) - E_{f}(D^{+1}; 0)}{1 - 0} = E_{f}(D^0; 0) - E_{f}(D^{+1}; 0)$$\n\nNext, we consider the complex, $C = (P_{\\mathrm{Si}}-V_{\\mathrm{Si}})$.\n**Assumption:** The \"donor-like\" transition on the complex corresponds to the phosphorus atom transitioning from $P_{\\mathrm{Si}}^{+1}$ to $P_{\\mathrm{Si}}^0$, while the silicon vacancy, $V_{\\mathrm{Si}}$, acts as a spectator, remaining in a fixed charge state $q_V$.\nUnder this assumption, the total charge of the complex transitions from $Q_1 = 1 + q_V$ to $Q_2 = q_V$.

This eigenvalue is triply degenerate, corresponding to similar states constructed from the $y$ and $z$ valleys.\n\nFor the remaining states, which are even, we can form combinations like $|\\phi_x\\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(|+\\!x\\rangle + |-\\!x\\rangle)$. Operating with $H_{vo}$ on this state gives:\n$$\nH_{vo} |\\phi_x\\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} H_{vo} (|+\\!x\\rangle + |-\\!x\\rangle) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} [(v_{0}+v_{1})(|+\\!x\\rangle + |-\\!x\\rangle) + 2v_{2}(|+\\!y\\rangle + |-\\!y\\rangle + |+\\!z\\rangle + |-\\!z\\rangle)]\n$$\n$$\nH_{vo} |\\phi_x\\rangle = (v_{0}+v_{1})|\\phi_x\\rangle + 2\\sqrt{2}v_{2}(|\\phi_y\\rangle + |\\phi_z\\rangle)\n$$\nBy symmetry, we have a $3 \\times 3$ matrix problem for the $\\{|\\phi_x\\rangle, |\\phi_y\\rangle, |\\phi_z\\rangle\\}$ basis:\n$$\nH'_{vo} = \n\\begin{pmatrix}\nv_{0}+v_{1}  2v_{2}  2v_{2} \\\\\n2v_{2}  v_{0}+v_{1}  2v_{2} \\\\\n2v_{2}  2v_{2}  v_{0}+v_{1}\n\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe fully symmetric $A_{1}$ state is $|\\psi_{A_1}\\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}}(|\\phi_x\\rangle + |\\phi_y\\rangle + |\\phi_z\\rangle)$. The corresponding eigenvalue is the sum of the elements in any row:\n$$\nE_{A_1} = (v_{0}+v_{1}) + 2v_{2} + 2v_{2} = v_{0} + v_{1} + 4v_{2}\n$$\nThe other two eigenvalues of this $3 \\times 3$ matrix correspond to the doubly degenerate $E$ representation. We can find them by considering a state orthogonal to the $A_1$ state, for instance $|\\psi_{E}\\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(|\\phi_x\\rangle - |\\phi_y\\rangle)$.\n$$\nH'_{vo} |\\psi_{E}\\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}[(v_{0}+v_{1})|\\phi_x\\rangle + 2v_{2}(|\\phi_y\\rangle+|\\phi_z\\rangle)] - \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}[2v_{2}(|\\phi_x\\rangle+|\\phi_z\\rangle) + (v_{0}+v_{1})|\\phi_y\\rangle]\n$$\n$$\n= \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}[(v_{0}+v_{1}-2v_{2})|\\phi_x\\rangle - (v_{0}+v_{1}-2v_{2})|\\phi_y\\rangle] = (v_{0}+v_{1}-2v_{2})|\\psi_{E}\\rangle\n$$\nThe eigenvalue for the $E$ states is thus $E_{E} = v_{0} + v_{1} - 2v_{2}$.\n\nIn summary, the three distinct symbolic eigenvalues are:\n$E_{A_1} = v_{0} + v_{1} + 4v_{2}$\n$E_{E} = v_{0} + v_{1} - 2v_{2}$\n$E_{T_2} = v_{0} - v_{1}$\n\n**Part b) Total Ground-State Energy**\n\nThe total energy of a donor state is the sum of the hydrogenic binding energy, $E_{1s,H}$, and the valley-orbit energy correction. The ground state corresponds to the lowest total energy. First, we compute the numerical values for the valley-orbit eigenvalues using $v_{0}=-1.2\\,\\mathrm{meV}$, $v_{1}=-1.8\\,\\mathrm{meV}$, and $v_{2}=-1.5\\,\\mathrm{meV}$:\n$E_{A_1} = -1.2 + (-1.8) + 4(-1.5) = -1.2 - 1.8 - 6.0 = -9.0\\,\\mathrm{meV}$\n$E_{E} = -1.2 + (-1.8) - 2(-1.5) = -1.2 - 1.8 + 3.0 = 0.0\\,\\mathrm{meV}$\n$E_{T_2} = -1.2 - (-1.8) = -1.2 + 1.8 = 0.6\\,\\mathrm{meV}$\nThe lowest energy level due to valley-orbit interaction is the nondegenerate $A_{1}$ state, $E_{A_1} = -9.0\\,\\mathrm{meV}$.\n\nNext, we calculate the hydrogenic binding energy, $E_{1s,H}$. The binding energy for a hydrogenic system scales with the effective mass $m^{\\ast}$ and the square of the dielectric constant $\\varepsilon_{r}$. Using the provided vacuum ground-state energy of hydrogen, $E_{H} = -13.605693\\,\\mathrm{eV}$:\n$$\nE_{1s,H} = E_{H} \\frac{m^{\\ast}/m_{0}}{(\\varepsilon_{r})^{2}}\n$$\nWe first calculate the isotropized effective mass ratio $m^{\\ast}/m_{0}$:\n$$\n\\frac{m^{\\ast}}{m_{0}} = \\left( \\left(\\frac{m_{l}}{m_{0}}\\right) \\left(\\frac{m_{t}}{m_{0}}\\right)^{2} \\right)^{1/3} = \\left( (0.916)(0.190)^{2} \\right)^{1/3} = (0.916 \\times 0.0361)^{1/3} = (0.0330676)^{1/3} \\approx 0.320984\n$$\nNow, we compute $E_{1s,H}$ using $\\varepsilon_{r} = 11.7$:\n$$\nE_{1s,H} = (-13.605693\\,\\mathrm{eV}) \\frac{0.320984}{(11.7)^{2}} = (-13.605693\\,\\mathrm{eV}) \\frac{0.320984}{136.89} \\approx -0.031902\\,\\mathrm{eV}\n$$\nConverting to millielectronvolts ($1\\,\\mathrm{eV} = 1000\\,\\mathrm{meV}$):\n$$\nE_{1s,H} \\approx -31.902\\,\\mathrm{meV}\n$$\nThe total ground-state energy, $E_{GS}$, is the sum of the hydrogenic energy and the energy of the $A_1$ valley-orbit state:\n$$\nE_{GS} = E_{1s,H} + E_{A_1} = -31.902\\,\\mathrm{meV} + (-9.0\\,\\mathrm{meV}) = -40.902\\,\\mathrm{meV}\n$$\nRounding to three significant figures as requested, we obtain the final answer for the ground-state energy.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{-40.9}\n$$", "id": "2815859"}]}
