All concepts and methods are standard in quantum mechanics and solid-state physics. The problem is scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and internally consistent. It is a valid problem of materials physics.\n\nPart 1: Derivation of the Dispersion Relation\n\nWe model the periodic potential over one period of length $L = a + b$. Let the origin $x=0$ be at the beginning of the barrier. The potential is given by:\n$$\nV(x) =\n\\begin{cases}\nU_0 & \\text{for } 0 < x < b \\quad \\text{(Region I: barrier)} \\\\\n0 & \\text{for } b < x < L \\quad \\text{(Region II: well)}\n\\end{cases}\n$$\nThe time-independent Schrödinger equation (TISE) is $-\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2m}\\frac{d^2\\psi}{dx^2} + V(x)\\psi = E\\psi$.\n\nIn Region I ($0 < x < b$), with $0 < E < U_0$, the TISE is $\\frac{d^2\\psi_I}{dx^2} = \\frac{2m(U_0 - E)}{\\hbar^2}\\psi_I = \\beta^2 \\psi_I$, where $\\beta = \\frac{\\sqrt{2m(U_0 - E)}}{\\hbar}$. The general solution is $\\psi_I(x) = A e^{\\beta x} + B e^{-\\beta x}$.\n\nIn Region II ($b < x < L$), the TISE is $\\frac{d^2\\psi_{II}}{dx^2} = -\\frac{2mE}{\\hbar^2}\\psi_{II} = -\\alpha^2 \\psi_{II}$, where $\\alpha = \\frac{\\sqrt{2mE}}{\\hbar}$. The general solution is $\\psi_{II}(x) = C e^{i\\alpha(x-b)} + D e^{-i\\alpha(x-b)}$.\n\nWe use the transfer matrix method. A state is represented by the vector $\\Psi(x) = \\begin{pmatrix} \\psi(x) \\\\ \\psi'(x) \\end{pmatrix}$.\nFor Region I, the matrix $M_I$ connects the state at $x=0$ to $x=b$: $\\Psi(b) = M_I \\Psi(0)$. The solution and its derivative can be written as $\\psi_I(x) = \\psi_I(0)\\cosh(\\beta x) + \\frac{\\psi_I'(0)}{\\beta}\\sinh(\\beta x)$ and $\\psi_I'(x) = \\psi_I(0)\\beta\\sinh(\\beta x) + \\psi_I'(0)\\cosh(\\beta x)$. Evaluating at $x=b$ gives the matrix:\n$$\nM_I = \\begin{pmatrix} \\cosh(\\beta b) & \\frac{1}{\\beta}\\sinh(\\beta b) \\\\ \\beta\\sinh(\\beta b) & \\cosh(\\beta b) \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nFor Region II, the matrix $M_{II}$ connects the state at $x=b$ to $x=L$: $\\Psi(L) = M_{II} \\Psi(b)$. The solution and its derivative are $\\psi_{II}(x') = \\psi_{II}(b)\\cos(\\alpha x') + \\frac{\\psi_{II}'(b)}{\\alpha}\\sin(\\alpha x')$, where $x' = x-b$. Note that the length of this region is $a = L-b$. Evaluating at $x'=a$ gives the matrix:\n$$\nM_{II} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos(\\alpha a) & \\frac{1}{\\alpha}\\sin(\\alpha a) \\\\ -\\alpha\\sin(\\alpha a) & \\cos(\\alpha a) \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe total transfer matrix for one period is $M = M_{II} M_I$, such that $\\Psi(L) = M \\Psi(0)$.\nBloch's theorem, $\\psi(x+L) = e^{ik_B L}\\psi(x)$, implies that $\\Psi(L) = e^{ik_B L}\\Psi(0)$. Thus, $e^{ik_B L}$ must be an eigenvalue of the matrix $M$. The eigenvalues $\\lambda$ of a $2 \\times 2$ matrix are found from the characteristic equation $\\lambda^2 - (\\text{Tr} M)\\lambda + (\\det M) = 0$.\nThe determinant of the transfer matrix for a time-independent potential is always unity. Indeed, $\\det(M_I) = \\cosh^2(\\beta b) - \\sinh^2(\\beta b) = 1$ and $\\det(M_{II}) = \\cos^2(\\alpha a) + \\sin^2(\\alpha a) = 1$, so $\\det(M) = 1$.\nThe eigenvalues are $\\lambda = e^{\\pm i k_B L}$. Substituting into the characteristic equation gives $\\lambda + \\frac{1}{\\lambda} = \\text{Tr} M$, which leads to $2\\cos(k_B L) = \\text{Tr} M$.\nWe calculate the trace of $M = M_{II} M_I$:\n$$\n\\text{Tr}(M) = \\text{Tr}\\left(\\begin{pmatrix} \\cos(\\alpha a) & \\frac{1}{\\alpha}\\sin(\\alpha a) \\\\ -\\alpha \\sin(\\alpha a) & \\cos(\\alpha a) \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} \\cosh(\\beta b) & \\frac{1}{\\beta}\\sinh(\\beta b) \\\\ \\beta\\sinh(\\beta b) & \\cosh(\\beta b) \\end{pmatrix}\\right)\n$$\n$M_{11} = \\cos(\\alpha a)\\cosh(\\beta b) + \\frac{\\beta}{\\alpha}\\sin(\\alpha a)\\sinh(\\beta b)$\n$M_{22} = -\\frac{\\alpha}{\\beta}\\sin(\\alpha a)\\sinh(\\beta b) + \\cos(\\alpha a)\\cosh(\\beta b)$\n$\\text{Tr}(M) = M_{11} + M_{22} = 2\\cos(\\alpha a)\\cosh(\\beta b) + \\left(\\frac{\\beta}{\\alpha} - \\frac{\\alpha}{\\beta}\\right)\\sin(\\alpha a)\\sinh(\\beta b)$.\nEquating this to $2\\cos(k_B L)$ yields the dispersion relation for $0 < E < U_0$:\n$$\n\\cos(k_B L) = \\cos(\\alpha a)\\cosh(\\beta b) + \\frac{\\beta^2 - \\alpha^2}{2\\alpha\\beta}\\sin(\\alpha a)\\sinh(\\beta b)\n$$\n\nPart 2: Analysis\n\nQualitative Explanation:\nThe allowed energy bands are defined by the condition $|\\cos(k_B L)| \\leq 1$, which means the right-hand side of the dispersion relation, let's call it $f(E)$, must be between $-1$ and $1$. The band gaps are energy ranges where $|f(E)| > 1$.\nThe parameter $\\beta = \\sqrt{2m(U_0 - E)}/\\hbar$ increases with $U_0$ for any fixed energy $E < U_0$. The terms $\\cosh(\\beta b)$ and $\\sinh(\\beta b)$ are exponentially increasing functions of their argument. Therefore, as $U_0$ increases, the amplitude of the oscillations of $f(E)$ as a function of $E$ (driven by the $\\cos(\\alpha a)$ and $\\sin(\\alpha a)$ terms) grows dramatically.\nConsequently, the energy intervals where $|f(E)| \\leq 1$ must shrink, leading to narrower allowed bands (reduced bandwidth). Conversely, the energy intervals where $|f(E)| > 1$ must expand, leading to wider band gaps. This explains why increasing $U_0$ widens the band gaps and narrows the bandwidths.\n\nPerturbative Calculation in the NFE limit ($U_0 \\to 0^+$):\nThe periodic potential $V(x)$ is treated as a perturbation. Its Fourier series is $V(x) = \\sum_G V_G e^{iGx}$, where $G = n \\frac{2\\pi}{L}$ for integer $n$. The Fourier coefficient $V_G$ is:\n$$\nV_G = \\frac{1}{L}\\int_0^L V(x)e^{-iGx} dx = \\frac{U_0}{L}\\int_0^b e^{-iGx} dx = \\frac{U_0}{L}\\left[\\frac{e^{-iGx}}{-iG}\\right]_0^b = \\frac{U_0(1-e^{-iGb})}{iGL}\n$$\nfor $G \\neq 0$. For the first reciprocal lattice vector $G=2\\pi/L$, we have:\n$$\nV_{G=2\\pi/L} = \\frac{U_0}{i(2\\pi/L)L}(1-e^{-i(2\\pi/L)b}) = \\frac{U_0}{2\\pi i} e^{-i\\pi b/L}(e^{i\\pi b/L}-e^{-i\\pi b/L}) = \\frac{U_0}{\\pi} \\sin(\\pi b/L) e^{-i\\pi b/L}\n$$\nThe average potential is $V_0 = \\frac{1}{L}\\int_0^b U_0 dx = \\frac{U_0 b}{L}$.\n\nFirst Band Gap at the Brillouin Zone Boundary:\nAt the BZ boundary ($k_B = \\pi/L$), the free-electron states $|\\pi/L\\rangle$ and $|-\\pi/L\\rangle$ are degenerate with unperturbed energy $E^0_{\\pi/L} = \\frac{\\hbar^2}{2m}(\\frac{\\pi}{L})^2$. The perturbation $V(x)$ lifts this degeneracy. The relevant matrix elements of the perturbation are $W_{11} = \\langle \\pi/L|V|\\pi/L \\rangle = V_0$, $W_{22} = \\langle -\\pi/L|V|-\\pi/L \\rangle = V_0$, $W_{12} = \\langle \\pi/L|V|-\\pi/L \\rangle = V_{2\\pi/L}$, and $W_{21} = \\langle -\\pi/L|V|\\pi/L \\rangle = V_{-2\\pi/L} = V_{2\\pi/L}^*$.\nThe energy corrections are the eigenvalues of the matrix $\\begin{pmatrix} V_0 & V_{2\\pi/L} \\\\ V_{2\\pi/L}^* & V_0 \\end{pmatrix}$, which are $E^{(1)} = V_0 \\pm |V_{2\\pi/L}|$.\nThe energies of the two states at the BZ boundary are shifted to $E_\\pm = E^0_{\\pi/L} + V_0 \\pm |V_{2\\pi/L}|$.\nThe width of the first band gap is the difference between these two energies:\n$$\nE_g = E_+ - E_- = 2|V_{2\\pi/L}| = 2\\left|\\frac{U_0}{\\pi} \\sin(\\pi b/L) e^{-i\\pi b/L}\\right| = \\frac{2U_0}{\\pi}\\sin(\\frac{\\pi b}{L})\n$$\nsince $\\sin(\\pi b/L) > 0$ for $0<b<L$.\n\nChange in the First Band's Bandwidth:\nThe bandwidth of the first band is $BW = E_{top} - E_{bottom}$.\nThe top of the first band is at $k_B=\\pi/L$, and its energy is the lower of the two split levels, $E_{top} = E_- = E^0_{\\pi/L} + V_0 - |V_{2\\pi/L}|$.\nThe bottom of the first band is at $k_B=0$. The unperturbed energy is $E^0_0 = 0$. This state is non-degenerate. To first order in perturbation theory, its energy is $E_{bottom} \\approx E^0_0 + \\langle k=0|V|k=0 \\rangle = 0 + V_0$.\nThe bandwidth of the perturbed first band is, to first order in $U_0$:\n$$\nBW \\approx E_{top} - E_{bottom} = (E^0_{\\pi/L} + V_0 - |V_{2\\pi/L}|) - V_0 = E^0_{\\pi/L} - |V_{2\\pi/L}|\n$$\nThe free-electron bandwidth is $BW_{free} = E^0_{\\pi/L} - E^0_0 = E^0_{\\pi/L}$.\nThe change in bandwidth relative to the free-electron case is $\\Delta BW = BW - BW_{free} = -|V_{2\\pi/L}|$.\n$$\n\\Delta BW = -\\frac{U_0}{\\pi}\\sin(\\frac{\\pi b}{L})\n$$\nThe bandwidth is reduced, and the reduction is proportional to $U_0$ to leading order.\n\nFinal Calculation: Derivative of the Bandwidth\nThe bandwidth can be expressed as a function of $U_0$. To first order, $BW(U_0) \\approx BW_{free} + \\Delta BW = \\frac{\\hbar^2 \\pi^2}{2m L^2} - \\frac{U_0}{\\pi}\\sin(\\frac{\\pi b}{L})$.\nHigher-order terms in the perturbation expansion for $BW(U_0)$ will be of order $U_0^2$ and higher.\nThe derivative of the first band's bandwidth with respect to $U_0$ is:\n$$\n\\frac{d(BW)}{dU_0} = \\frac{d}{dU_0}\\left( \\frac{\\hbar^2 \\pi^2}{2m L^2} - \\frac{U_0}{\\pi}\\sin(\\frac{\\pi b}{L}) + O(U_0^2) \\right) = -\\frac{1}{\\pi}\\sin(\\frac{\\pi b}{L}) + O(U_0)\n$$\nEvaluating this derivative at $U_0=0^{+}$ gives the coefficient of the linear term:\n$$\n\\left.\\frac{d(BW)}{dU_0}\\right|_{U_0=0^+} = -\\frac{1}{\\pi}\\sin\\left(\\frac{\\pi b}{L}\\right)\n$$\nSubstituting $L = a+b$, we obtain the final answer in terms of $a$ and $b$:\n$$\n\\left.\\frac{d(BW)}{dU_0}\\right|_{U_0=0^+} = -\\frac{1}{\\pi}\\sin\\left(\\frac{\\pi b}{a+b}\\right)\n$$", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{-\\frac{1}{\\pi}\\sin\\left(\\frac{\\pi b}{a+b}\\right)}\n$$", "id": "2802198"}, {"introduction": "Moving from conceptual models to real-world materials, a primary technique in bandgap engineering is the creation of semiconductor alloys.

The problem is therefore deemed valid, and we shall proceed with its solution.\n\nThe valence band maximum in most cubic semiconductors (such as $\\text{Si}$, $\\text{Ge}$, $\\text{GaAs}$) is located at the center of the Brillouin zone ($\\Gamma$ point) and is degenerate. The states near $\\Gamma$ are described by the Luttinger-Kohn Hamiltonian for the total angular momentum $J=3/2$ manifold. The eigenvalues of this Hamiltonian give the energy dispersion relations for the heavy-hole (hh) and light-hole (lh) bands. The split-off band ($J=1/2$) is neglected in this model. The electron energies $E(\\mathbf{k})$ of these two bands (which are doubly degenerate) are given by the well-established expression:\n$$E_{\\pm}(\\mathbf{k}) = -\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2m_0}\\gamma_1 k^2 \\pm \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2m_0}\\right)^2 \\left[ 4\\gamma_2^2 k^4 + 12(\\gamma_3^2-\\gamma_2^2)(k_x^2 k_y^2 + k_y^2 k_z^2 + k_z^2 k_x^2) \\right]}$$\nHere, $m_0$ is the free-electron mass, $\\mathbf{k}=(k_x, k_y, k_z)$ is the wavevector relative to the $\\Gamma$ point, $k^2 = k_x^2+k_y^2+k_z^2$, and $\\gamma_1, \\gamma_2, \\gamma_3$ are the material-specific Luttinger parameters. The energy reference $E=0$ is set at the valence band maximum. The hole energy $E_h$ is defined as the negative of the electron energy, $E_h(\\mathbf{k}) = -E(\\mathbf{k})$, resulting in a positive dispersion. The problem further defines the hole effective mass $m_h$ via the expansion $E(\\mathbf{k}) \\approx -(\\hbar^2/2)k^2/m_h$. This is equivalent to using the curvature definition for the hole dispersion: $E_h(\\mathbf{k}) \\approx (\\hbar^2/2)k^2/m_h$. The light-hole band has a larger curvature (higher energy for a given $k$) than the heavy-hole band. Thus, for holes:\n$$E_{lh}(\\mathbf{k}) = \\frac{\\hbar^2}{2m_0}\\gamma_1 k^2 + \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2m_0}\\right)^2 \\left[ 4\\gamma_2^2 k^4 + 12(\\gamma_3^2-\\gamma_2^2)(k_x^2 k_y^2 + k_y^2 k_z^2 + k_z^2 k_x^2) \\right]}$$\n$$E_{hh}(\\mathbf{k}) = \\frac{\\hbar^2}{2m_0}\\gamma_1 k^2 - \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2m_0}\\right)^2 \\left[ 4\\gamma_2^2 k^4 + 12(\\gamma_3^2-\\gamma_2^2)(k_x^2 k_y^2 + k_y^2 k_z^2 + k_z^2 k_x^2) \\right]}$$\nAssuming the standard convention where the Luttinger parameters are positive, these expressions yield $E_{lh} > E_{hh} > 0$ for $k \\neq 0$.\n\nWe are tasked to find the effective masses along specific crystallographic directions. The effective mass $m_h$ along a direction defined by a unit vector $\\hat{\\mathbf{u}}$ is found from the parabolic approximation $E_h(k\\hat{\\mathbf{u}}) = \\frac{\\hbar^2 k^2}{2 m_h}$ for small $k$.\n\nFirst, we derive the masses along the $[100]$ direction.\nFor propagation along $[100]$, the wavevector is $\\mathbf{k} = (k, 0, 0)$. Thus, $k_x = k$, $k_y = 0$, $k_z = 0$, and the total magnitude is simply $k$.\nThe anisotropic term in the dispersion relation evaluates to $k_x^2 k_y^2 + k_y^2 k_z^2 + k_z^2 k_x^2 = k^2 \\cdot 0 + 0 \\cdot 0 + 0 \\cdot k^2 = 0$.\nThe square root term simplifies significantly:\n$$\\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2m_0}\\right)^2 [4\\gamma_2^2 k^4]} = \\frac{\\hbar^2 k^2}{2m_0} (2|\\gamma_2|) = \\frac{\\hbar^2 k^2}{m_0}\\gamma_2$$\nwhere we assume $\\gamma_2 > 0$. The dispersions become:\n$$E_{lh}^{[100]}(k) = \\frac{\\hbar^2 k^2}{2m_0}\\gamma_1 + \\frac{\\hbar^2 k^2}{m_0}\\gamma_2 = \\frac{\\hbar^2 k^2}{2m_0}(\\gamma_1 + 2\\gamma_2)$$\n$$E_{hh}^{[100]}(k) = \\frac{\\hbar^2 k^2}{2m_0}\\gamma_1 - \\frac{\\hbar^2 k^2}{m_0}\\gamma_2 = \\frac{\\hbar^2 k^2}{2m_0}(\\gamma_1 - 2\\gamma_2)$$\nBy comparing these to $E_h = \\frac{\\hbar^2 k^2}{2m_h}$, we obtain the inverse effective masses:\n$$\\frac{1}{m_{lh}^{[100]}} = \\frac{1}{m_0}(\\gamma_1 + 2\\gamma_2) \\implies \\frac{m_{lh}^{[100]}}{m_0} = \\tilde{m}_{lh}^{[100]} = \\frac{1}{\\gamma_1 + 2\\gamma_2}$$\n$$\\frac{1}{m_{hh}^{[100]}} = \\frac{1}{m_0}(\\gamma_1 - 2\\gamma_2) \\implies \\frac{m_{hh}^{[100]}}{m_0} = \\tilde{m}_{hh}^{[100]} = \\frac{1}{\\gamma_1 - 2\\gamma_2}$$\n\nSecond, we derive the masses along the $[111]$ direction.\nFor propagation along $[111]$, the wavevector is $\\mathbf{k} = \\frac{k}{\\sqrt{3}}(1, 1, 1)$. Thus, $k_x = k_y = k_z = k/\\sqrt{3}$.\nThe component products are $k_x^2 = k_y^2 = k_z^2 = k^2/3$.\nThe anisotropic term evaluates to $k_x^2 k_y^2 + k_y^2 k_z^2 + k_z^2 k_x^2 = 3 \\times (k^2/3)^2 = 3(k^4/9) = k^4/3$.\nSubstituting this into the general dispersion relation:\n$$E_{h \\pm}^{[111]}(k) = \\frac{\\hbar^2 k^2}{2m_0}\\gamma_1 \\pm \\frac{\\hbar^2}{m_0}\\sqrt{\\gamma_2^2 k^4 + 3(\\gamma_3^2-\\gamma_2^2)(k^4/3)}$$\n$$E_{h \\pm}^{[111]}(k) = \\frac{\\hbar^2 k^2}{2m_0}\\gamma_1 \\pm \\frac{\\hbar^2}{m_0}\\sqrt{\\gamma_2^2 k^4 + (\\gamma_3^2-\\gamma_2^2)k^4} = \\frac{\\hbar^2 k^2}{2m_0}\\gamma_1 \\pm \\frac{\\hbar^2}{m_0}\\sqrt{\\gamma_3^2 k^4}$$\nAssuming $\\gamma_3 > 0$, this simplifies to:\n$$E_{lh}^{[111]}(k) = \\frac{\\hbar^2 k^2}{2m_0}(\\gamma_1 + 2\\gamma_3)$$\n$$E_{hh}^{[111]}(k) = \\frac{\\hbar^2 k^2}{2m_0}(\\gamma_1 - 2\\gamma_3)$$\nFrom these, we find the dimensionless effective masses:\n$$\\tilde{m}_{lh}^{[111]} = \\frac{1}{\\gamma_1 + 2\\gamma_3}$$\n$$\\tilde{m}_{hh}^{[111]} = \\frac{1}{\\gamma_1 - 2\\gamma_3}$$\n\nNow, we address the qualitative discussion.\nAnisotropy, in this context, refers to the dependence of the energy dispersion and effective masses on the direction of propagation. Examining the general dispersion formula, the source of anisotropy is the term $12(\\gamma_3^2-\\gamma_2^2)(k_x^2 k_y^2 + k_y^2 k_z^2 + k_z^2 k_x^2)$. If $\\gamma_2 = \\gamma_3$, this term vanishes, and the energy eigenvalues become $E_{h \\pm}(k) = \\frac{\\hbar^2 k^2}{2m_0}(\\gamma_1 \\pm 2|\\gamma_2|)$, which depends only on the magnitude $k$ and not on its direction. This is the spherical approximation. Therefore, the difference between $\\gamma_2$ and $\\gamma_3$ is a direct measure of the valence band anisotropy. Our derived effective masses explicitly demonstrate this: the masses along $[100]$ depend on $\\gamma_2$, while the masses along $[111]$ depend on $\\gamma_3$. Anisotropy means $m_h^{[100]} \\neq m_h^{[111]}$, which is true if and only if $\\gamma_2 \\neq \\gamma_3$.\n\nThe implications for band engineering in pseudomorphic strained layers are profound. When a semiconductor is grown as a thin layer on a substrate with a different lattice constant, it experiences biaxial strain. This strain breaks the cubic symmetry of the crystal, reducing it to tetragonal for a $[001]$ growth direction or trigonal for a $[111]$ growth direction. The primary effect of this symmetry reduction is the lifting of the heavy-hole/light-hole degeneracy at the $\\Gamma$ point.\nFor a layer grown along $[001]$, the strain creates an energy splitting between the states with angular momentum projection $|m_J|=3/2$ (heavy hole) and $|m_J|=1/2$ (light hole) along the growth axis. For typical compressive strain, the HH band moves to a higher energy, becoming the topmost valence band. Crucially, the curvature of this band is modified. The in-plane effective mass of this new ground state hole band becomes light, approximately given by $m_0/(\\gamma_1+\\gamma_2)$, while the mass along the growth direction is heavy, $m_0/(\\gamma_1-2\\gamma_2)$.\nFor a layer grown along $[111]$, the trigonal strain also lifts the HH-LH degeneracy. However, the symmetry is different. The character of the wavefunctions and the resulting band curvatures are distinct from the $[001]$ case. The in-plane mass of the top valence band will be an average involving both $\\gamma_2$ and $\\gamma_3$, and importantly, the in-plane dispersion itself may become anisotropic (e.g., mass along $[1\\bar{1}0]$ differs from mass along $[11\\bar{2}]$).\nThe choice of growth direction, $[001]$ versus $[111]$, therefore offers a critical design parameter in bandgap engineering. It allows for the manipulation of the valence band structure by leveraging the material's intrinsic anisotropy ($\\gamma_2 \\neq \\gamma_3$) in combination with an externally applied strain field whose symmetry depends on the growth orientation. This targeted modification of effective masses and band splittings is essential for optimizing the performance of electronic and optoelectronic devices, such as reducing the threshold current in semiconductor lasers or enhancing hole mobility in transistors.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{1}{\\gamma_1 - 2\\gamma_2} & \\frac{1}{\\gamma_1 + 2\\gamma_2} & \\frac{1}{\\gamma_1 - 2\\gamma_3} & \\frac{1}{\\gamma_1 + 2\\gamma_3} \\end{pmatrix}}\n$$", "id": "2802236"}]}
