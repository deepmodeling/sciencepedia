This means that $|\\mathbf{q}|$ is less than $0.2\\%$ of the size of the Brillouin zone. The crystal momentum of an electron, $\\mathbf{k}$, can take any value within the Brillouin zone. Therefore, the momentum contributed by the photon, $\\mathbf{q}$, is a minuscule perturbation to the electron's momentum on the scale of the $E$-$\\mathbf{k}$ diagram. The transition is thus nearly vertical ($\\Delta \\mathbf{k} = \\mathbf{k}_f - \\mathbf{k}_i = \\mathbf{q} \\approx \\mathbf{0}$). This is crucial for optical processes. In a direct-gap semiconductor, where the valence band maximum and conduction band minimum occur at the same $\\mathbf{k}$-vector, this vertical transition is allowed and efficient.
