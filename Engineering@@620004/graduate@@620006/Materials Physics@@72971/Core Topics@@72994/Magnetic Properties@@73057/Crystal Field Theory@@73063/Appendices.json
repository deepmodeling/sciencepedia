The ligands are modeled as point charges $-q$ at a fixed distance $R$ from the central ion.\n\nFirst, we establish the perturbation Hamiltonian. The electrostatic potential $V(\\boldsymbol{r})$ at the electron's position $\\boldsymbol{r}$ due to ligands at positions $\\{\\boldsymbol{R}_j\\}$ is given by:\n$$ V(\\boldsymbol{r}) = \\sum_j \\frac{-q}{|\\boldsymbol{R}_j - \\boldsymbol{r}|} $$\nThe perturbation to the Hamiltonian of the central ion is $H' = -e V(\\boldsymbol{r})$, where $-e$ is the charge of the electron.\n$$ H'(\\boldsymbol{r}) = eq \\sum_j \\frac{1}{|\\boldsymbol{R}_j - \\boldsymbol{r}|} $$\nFor a $d$-electron, we assume its wavefunction is well-localized near the nucleus, such that its radial coordinate $r = |\\boldsymbol{r}|$ is much smaller than the metal-ligand distance $R = |\\boldsymbol{R}_j|$. We can therefore use the multipole expansion of the potential in powers of $r/R$. The standard expansion in terms of Legendre polynomials $P_l$ is:\n$$ \\frac{1}{|\\boldsymbol{R}_j - \\boldsymbol{r}|} = \\frac{1}{R} \\sum_{l=0}^\\infty \\left(\\frac{r}{R}\\right)^l P_l(\\cos \\gamma_j) $$\nwhere $\\gamma_j$ is the angle between $\\boldsymbol{r}$ and $\\boldsymbol{R}_j$, so $\\cos\\gamma_j = \\hat{\\boldsymbol{r}} \\cdot \\hat{\\boldsymbol{R}}_j$. The perturbation Hamiltonian becomes:\n$$ H'(\\boldsymbol{r}) = \\frac{eq}{R} \\sum_{l=0}^\\infty \\left(\\frac{r}{R}\\right)^l \\sum_j P_l(\\hat{\\boldsymbol{r}} \\cdot \\hat{\\boldsymbol{R}}_j) $$\nThe energy shift of a $d$-orbital state $|\\psi\\rangle$ is given by first-order perturbation theory as $\\delta E = \\langle \\psi | H' | \\psi \\rangle$. The $d$-orbitals are states of definite parity (even, or gerade, $g$). The matrix element $\\langle \\psi | H' | \\psi \\rangle$ is non-zero only for even-parity terms in $H'$. The term $(r/R)^l P_l$ has parity $(-1)^l$. Consequently, only terms with even $l$ can contribute to the first-order energy shifts of the $d$-levels. This eliminates $l=1, 3, 5, \\dots$ from consideration.\n\nLet's inspect the first few even-$l$ terms.\nThe $l=0$ term:\n$H'_{l=0} = \\frac{eq}{R} (r/R)^0 \\sum_j P_0(\\hat{\\boldsymbol{r}} \\cdot \\hat{\\boldsymbol{R}}_j) = \\frac{eq}{R} N$, where $N$ is the number of ligands ($N=6$ for octahedral, $N=4$ for tetrahedral). This term is a constant potential, which shifts all $d$-orbitals by the same amount and causes no splitting.\n\nThe $l=2$ term:\nThe contribution to the potential from this term is proportional to $\\sum_j P_2(\\hat{\\boldsymbol{r}} \\cdot \\hat{\\boldsymbol{R}}_j)$. For both the octahedral and tetrahedral arrangements of identical charges, the sum of the second-order moments of the ligand positions vanishes due to symmetry. This can be seen by considering the potential expansion in Cartesian coordinates. The term of order $r^2$ is $\\sum_{j,\\alpha,\\beta} x_\\alpha x_\\beta (3R_{j\\alpha}R_{j\\beta} - R^2\\delta_{\\alpha\\beta})$. For both octahedral and tetrahedral symmetries, we have $\\sum_j R_{j\\alpha}R_{j\\beta} \\propto \\delta_{\\alpha\\beta}$ and $\\sum_j R_{j\\alpha}^2 = \\sum_j R_{j\\beta}^2$. For the octahedral case, $\\sum_j R_{jx}^2 = 2R^2$ and for the tetrahedral case, $\\sum_j R_{jx}^2 = 4(R/\\sqrt{3})^2 = 4R^2/3$. The sum $\\sum_j (3R_{j\\alpha}^2 - R^2)$ becomes $3(2R^2)-6R^2=0$ for octahedral and $3(4R^2/3)-4R^2=0$ for tetrahedral environments with $N=6$ and $N=4$ ligands respectively. Therefore, the $l=2$ term is isotropic and does not contribute to splitting.\n\nThe leading anisotropic term that splits the $d$-orbitals is therefore the $l=4$ term.\n$$ H'_{CF} \\approx H'_{l=4} = \\frac{eqr^4}{R^5} \\sum_j P_4(\\hat{\\boldsymbol{r}} \\cdot \\hat{\\boldsymbol{R}}_j) $$\nThis is the crystal field Hamiltonian.\n\nTo calculate the expectation values, it is more convenient to work with Cartesian coordinates.

The spherically symmetric part of $x^4+y^4+z^4$ is $\\frac{3}{5}r^4$.

Let the energy of the barycenter be the reference energy, set to $0$. Let $E_{t_{2g}}$ and $E_{e_{g}}$ be the energies of the $t_{2g}$ and $e_{g}$ levels, respectively. The degeneracies are $g_{t_{2g}} = 3$ and $g_{e_{g}} = 2$.\n\nThe conservation of the barycenter (the energy-weighted mean of the levels) is expressed as:\n$$g_{t_{2g}} E_{t_{2g}} + g_{e_{g}} E_{e_{g}} = 0$$\nSubstituting the degeneracies, we have:\n$$3 E_{t_{2g}} + 2 E_{e_{g}} = 0 \\quad (1)$$\n\nThe total energy separation between the levels is given as the crystal field splitting parameter, $\\Delta$:\n$$E_{e_{g}} - E_{t_{2g}} = \\Delta \\quad (2)$$\n\nWe have a system of two linear equations with two unknowns, $E_{t_{2g}}$ and $E_{e_{g}}$.

Therefore the ordering (from lowest to highest energy) is:\n- Lowest doubly-degenerate level: ($d_{xy}, d_{x^2-y^2}$).\n- Middle doubly-degenerate level: ($d_{xz}, d_{yz}$).\n- Highest non-degenerate level: $d_{z^2}$.\n\nLet the energies of these three levels relative to the barycenter be $E_1$ (lowest), $E_2$ (middle), and $E_3$ (highest). By definition,\n$$E_2 = E_1 + \\Delta_1, \\quad E_3 = E_2 + \\Delta_2 = E_1 + \\Delta_1 + \\Delta_2.$$\nThe barycenter condition (weighted average with degeneracies 2,2,1) is\n$$2E_1 + 2E_2 + E_3 = 0.$$\nSubstituting $E_2$ and $E_3$ in terms of $E_1$, $\\Delta_1$, and $\\Delta_2$ gives\n$$2E_1 + 2(E_1 + \\Delta_1) + (E_1 + \\Delta_1 + \\Delta_2) = 0,$$\n$$5E_1 + 3\\Delta_1 + \\Delta_2 = 0,$$\nso\n$$E_1 = -\\frac{3\\Delta_1 + \\Delta_2}{5}, \\quad E_2 = E_1 + \\Delta_1 = \\frac{2\\Delta_1 - \\Delta_2}{5}, \\quad E_3 = E_2 + \\Delta_2 = \\frac{2\\Delta_1 + 4\\Delta_2}{5}.$$\n\nFor a $d^8$ strong-field complex, electrons fill the lowest levels with pairing favored over promotion. The occupation is:\n- Lowest doublet: 4 electrons (fully paired).\n- Middle doublet: 4 electrons (fully paired).\n- Highest singlet: 0 electrons.\nAll electrons are paired, so the complex is diamagnetic.\n\nThe Crystal Field Stabilization Energy (CFSE), measured relative to the barycenter, is the sum of orbital energies for the occupied electrons:\n$$\\text{CFSE} = 4E_1 + 4E_2 = 4(E_1 + E_2).$$\nUsing the expressions above,\n$$E_1 + E_2 = -\\frac{3\\Delta_1 + \\Delta_2}{5} + \\frac{2\\Delta_1 - \\Delta_2}{5} = -\\frac{\\Delta_1 + 2\\Delta_2}{5},$$\nhence\n$$\\text{CFSE} = 4\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta_1 + 2\\Delta_2}{5}\\right) = -\\frac{4}{5}\\left(\\Delta_1 + 2\\Delta_2\\right).$$\n\nThus, the lowest-energy orbitals are ($d_{xy}, d_{x^2-y^2}$), the complex is diamagnetic, and the CFSE is $-\\frac{4}{5}(\\Delta_1 + 2\\Delta_2)$, which corresponds to option A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2242480"}]}
