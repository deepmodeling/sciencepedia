All necessary data are provided, and there are no contradictions or fallacies. The problem is a standard exercise in the physics of magnetic materials. We may proceed with the solution.\n\nThe magnetocrystalline anisotropy energy density $E$ for a cubic crystal is given by the lowest-order expression:\n$$\nE(\\alpha_1, \\alpha_2, \\alpha_3) = K_1 \\left(\\alpha_1^2 \\alpha_2^2 + \\alpha_2^2 \\alpha_3^2 + \\alpha_3^2 \\alpha_1^2\\right)\n$$\nwhere $\\alpha_1$, $\\alpha_2$, and $\\alpha_3$ are the direction cosines of the magnetization vector $\\mathbf{M}$ with respect to the cubic axes $[100]$, $[010]$, and $[001]$. The direction cosines are constrained by the normalization condition $\\alpha_1^2 + \\alpha_2^2 + \\alpha_3^2 = 1$. The easy directions of magnetization correspond to the orientations of $\\mathbf{M}$ for which the energy $E$ is minimized.\n\nWe must evaluate $E$ along the three high-symmetry crystallographic directions: $\\langle 100 \\rangle$, $\\langle 110 \\rangle$, and $\\langle 111 \\rangle$.

We need to find the angle between the vector representing the $[001]$ direction, $\\mathbf{v} = (0, 0, 1)$, and the vectors of the $\\langle 111 \\rangle$ type, e.g., $\\mathbf{u} = (1, 1, 1)$. The angle $\\theta$ is given by the dot product formula:\n$$\n\\cos\\theta = \\frac{\\mathbf{u} \\cdot \\mathbf{v}}{|\\mathbf{u}| |\\mathbf{v}|}\n$$\nUsing $\\mathbf{u}=(1, 1, 1)$ and $\\mathbf{v}=(0, 0, 1)$:\n$|\\mathbf{u}| = \\sqrt{1^2+1^2+1^2} = \\sqrt{3}$\n$|\\mathbf{v}| = \\sqrt{0^2+0^2+1^2} = 1$\n$\\mathbf{u} \\cdot \\mathbf{v} = (1)(0) + (1)(0) + (1)(1) = 1$\nSo, $\\cos\\theta_{\\mathrm{Ni}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}}$.\nThe directions in the $\\langle 111 \\rangle$ family are of the form $(\\pm 1, \\pm 1, \\pm 1)$.

The resulting values for $a$ and $b$ are then rounded to six decimal places.\n\n- For Dataset $1$, the calculation yields $a_1 \\approx 0.612841$ MJ/m$^3$ and $b_1 \\approx 2.103986$ mJ/m$^2$.\n- For Dataset $2$, the calculation yields $a_2 \\approx 0.197917$ MJ/m$^3$ and $b_2 \\approx 3.004167$ mJ/m$^2$.\n- For Dataset $3$, the data points precisely fit the model with $a_3=1.1$, $b_3=0.9$, and $c_3=-2.0$. The numerical least-squares fit recovers these values to high precision, yielding $a_3 \\approx 1.100000$ MJ/m$^3$ and $b_3 \\approx 0.899999$ mJ/m$^2$ after rounding.", "answer": "```python\n# The complete and runnable Python 3 code goes here.\n# Imports must adhere to the specified execution environment.\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates volume and surface magnetocrystalline anisotropy contributions\n    by fitting thickness-dependent data to a physical model using linear\n    least squares.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Define the test cases from the problem statement.
