In this case, there is only one positive eigenvalue. Therefore, the mean-field Néel temperature for the triangular lattice antiferromagnet is:\n$$\nT_N = \\frac{JS(S+1)}{k_B}\n$$\nThis expression provides the temperature in Kelvin, provided the Boltzmann constant $k_B$ and the exchange energy $J$ are given in compatible SI units (e.g., Joules per Kelvin and Joules, respectively).\n\nTo understand the impact of frustration, we compare this result to that of a hypothetical bipartite lattice with the same coordination number $z=6$, such as a simple cubic lattice. For a bipartite lattice, a site on sublattice $A$ is surrounded by $z=6$ neighbors all on sublattice $B$. The effective field on site $A$ is $\\mathbf{h}_{\\text{eff}, A} = -zJ\\mathbf{m}_B$. With the collinear antiferromagnetic order $\\mathbf{m}_B = -\\mathbf{m}_A$, the field becomes $\\mathbf{h}_{\\text{eff}, A} = zJ\\mathbf{m}_A$. The self-consistency condition $zJ\\chi_0(T_N) = 1$ gives $T_N^{\\text{bipartite}} = \\frac{zJS(S+1)}{3k_B}$. With $z=6$:\n$$\nT_N^{\\text{bipartite}} = \\frac{6JS(S+1)}{3k_B} = \\frac{2JS(S+1)}{k_B}\n$$\nComparing the two results, we find $T_N^{\\text{triangular}} = \\frac{1}{2} T_N^{\\text{bipartite}}$. The geometric frustration of the triangular lattice prevents a simple collinear arrangement where every pair of neighboring spins is antiparallel. In the $120^\\circ$ structure, the effective antiferromagnetic coupling felt by a spin is reduced. The sum of interactions from a spin's neighbors, which would align perfectly antiparallel for an unfrustrated lattice, is now a partial, frustrated sum.
