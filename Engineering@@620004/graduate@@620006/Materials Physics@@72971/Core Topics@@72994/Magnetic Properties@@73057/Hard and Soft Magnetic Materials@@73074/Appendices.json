It presents a standard task in materials physics based on realistic experimental data. I will proceed with the solution.\n\nThe problem requires the calculation of the hysteresis loop squareness, denoted here by the symbol $S$, and a qualitative justification for classifying the material as magnetically hard or soft.\n\nFirst, the calculation of squareness. The problem defines squareness as the ratio of the remanent magnetization, $M_r$, to the saturation magnetization, $M_s$. Mathematically, this is expressed as:\n$$S = \\frac{M_r}{M_s}$$\nThe experimental data are provided not for magnetization $M$ directly, but for the product $\\mu_{0} M$, where $\\mu_{0}$ is the magnetic constant, also known as the permeability of free space.

The classification of a magnetic material as \"hard\" or \"soft\" is fundamentally determined by its resistance to changes in its state of magnetization. This property is quantified by the coercive field, or coercivity, $H_c$.\n\nA magnetically soft material is characterized by a low coercivity. This means a small externally applied magnetic field is sufficient to switch its magnetization. Microscopically, this corresponds to low energy barriers for the movement of magnetic domain walls or the rotation of magnetization vectors. Consequently, soft materials exhibit narrow hysteresis loops, signifying low energy loss per magnetization cycle. They are used in applications requiring frequent and rapid changes in magnetization, such as in transformer cores and recording heads.\n\nA magnetically hard material, in contrast, is characterized by a high coercivity. A large external field is required to demagnetize it or reverse its magnetization. This indicates the presence of high energy barriers that impede changes in magnetization. These barriers arise from microstructural features, primarily strong magnetocrystalline anisotropy, which energetically favors alignment of magnetization along specific crystallographic axes, and the pinning of domain walls at defects such as grain boundaries, precipitates, or lattice imperfections. Hard materials exhibit broad hysteresis loops, indicating a large amount of energy is stored, making them suitable for use as permanent magnets.\n\nIn the given problem, the coercive field is $H_c = 800\\,\\mathrm{kA/m}$. This is an exceptionally large value. For reference, magnetically soft materials like pure iron or silicon steel have coercivities on the order of $10^{-1}\\,\\mathrm{kA/m}$ to $10^{-2}\\,\\mathrm{kA/m}$ (i.e., $100\\,\\mathrm{A/m}$ to $10\\,\\mathrm{A/m}$). The value of $800\\,\\mathrm{kA/m}$ is characteristic of high-performance permanent magnets, such as rare-earth magnets (e.g., Nd-Fe-B or Sm-Co alloys). Such a high coercivity implies that a very large energy input is required to overcome the microstructural impediments to demagnetization.\n\nFurthermore, the high remanence ($\\mu_{0} M_{r} = 1.2\\,\\mathrm{T}$) and the high squareness ($S \\approx 0.8571$) are also hallmarks of a good permanent magnet. A high squareness signifies that the material retains a large fraction of its saturation magnetization after the magnetizing field is removed, which is the defining function of a permanent magnet.\n\nTherefore, based on the very high coercive field, which reflects a large energy barrier to demagnetization rooted in fundamental domain processes, the specimen must be classified as a hard magnetic material.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.8571}$$", "id": "2827412"}, {"introduction": "Having learned to identify a hard magnet from its hysteresis loop, we now explore the fundamental physics that gives rise to its \"hardness.\" This practice guides you through a foundational thought experiment, the Stoner-Wohlfarth model, to understand the role of magnetocrystalline anisotropy.

It describes the classic Stoner-Wohlfarth model for coherent magnetization rotation under a transverse field. The theoretical framework is sound, and the provided parameters are physically realistic for hard magnetic materials. The problem contains no contradictions or ambiguities. It is a standard, valid problem in magnetism. We proceed with the solution.\n\nThe total energy density of the single-domain ferromagnet is the sum of the magnetocrystalline anisotropy energy and the Zeeman energy:\n$$E(\\theta) = K_{1}\\sin^{2}\\theta - \\mu_{0}M_{s}H\\sin\\theta$$\nwhere the field is applied at an angle $\\frac{\\pi}{2}$ to the easy axis.\n\nThe equilibrium orientation of the magnetization is found by minimizing the total energy density with respect to the angle $\\theta$. This requires the first derivative of the energy to be zero:\n$$\\frac{dE}{d\\theta} = \\frac{d}{d\\theta}(K_{1}\\sin^{2}\\theta - \\mu_{0}M_{s}H\\sin\\theta) = 0$$\n$$2K_{1}\\sin\\theta\\cos\\theta - \\mu_{0}M_{s}H\\cos\\theta = 0$$\nFactoring yields:\n$$\\cos\\theta (2K_{1}\\sin\\theta - \\mu_{0}M_{s}H) = 0$$\nThis equation provides two possible conditions for equilibrium.\n\nFor an equilibrium to be stable, it must correspond to a local minimum of the energy function. This requires the second derivative of the energy to be positive:\n$$\\frac{d^{2}E}{d\\theta^{2}} > 0$$\nWe compute the second derivative:\n$$\\frac{d^{2}E}{d\\theta^{2}} = \\frac{d}{d\\theta}(2K_{1}\\sin\\theta\\cos\\theta - \\mu_{0}M_{s}H\\cos\\theta)$$\n$$\\frac{d^{2}E}{d\\theta^{2}} = 2K_{1}(\\cos^{2}\\theta - \\sin^{2}\\theta) + \\mu_{0}M_{s}H\\sin\\theta$$\nUsing the trigonometric identity $\\cos^{2}\\theta - \\sin^{2}\\theta = 1 - 2\\sin^{2}\\theta$, we obtain:\n$$\\frac{d^{2}E}{d\\theta^{2}} = 2K_{1}(1 - 2\\sin^{2}\\theta) + \\mu_{0}M_{s}H\\sin\\theta$$\n\nThe problem asks for the critical field at which the easy-axis minimum loses stability. In the absence of a field ($H=0$), the easy-axis minima are at $\\theta=0$ and $\\theta=\\pi$. As the transverse field $H$ increases from zero, the magnetization rotates away from the easy axis. The relevant equilibrium condition is the second one:\n$$2K_{1}\\sin\\theta - \\mu_{0}M_{s}H = 0 \\implies \\sin\\theta = \\frac{\\mu_{0}M_{s}H}{2K_{1}}$$\nThis solution describes the rotation of the magnetization towards the field direction. It is physically valid for $|\\sin\\theta| \\leq 1$, which implies $H \\leq \\frac{2K_{1}}{\\mu_{0}M_{s}}$.\n\nTo check the stability of this equilibrium state, we substitute $\\sin\\theta = \\frac{\\mu_{0}M_{s}H}{2K_{1}}$ into the expression for the second derivative:\n$$\\frac{d^{2}E}{d\\theta^{2}} = 2K_{1} - 4K_{1}\\sin^{2}\\theta + \\mu_{0}M_{s}H\\sin\\theta$$\n$$\\frac{d^{2}E}{d\\theta^{2}} = 2K_{1} - 4K_{1}\\left(\\frac{\\mu_{0}M_{s}H}{2K_{1}}\\right)^{2} + \\mu_{0}M_{s}H\\left(\\frac{\\mu_{0}M_{s}H}{2K_{1}}\\right)$$\n$$\\frac{d^{2}E}{d\\theta^{2}} = 2K_{1} - \\frac{(\\mu_{0}M_{s}H)^{2}}{K_{1}} + \\frac{(\\mu_{0}M_{s}H)^{2}}{2K_{1}}$$\n$$\\frac{d^{2}E}{d\\theta^{2}} = 2K_{1} - \\frac{(\\mu_{0}M_{s}H)^{2}}{2K_{1}}$$\nThe stability condition $\\frac{d^{2}E}{d\\theta^{2}} > 0$ requires:\n$$2K_{1} - \\frac{(\\mu_{0}M_{s}H)^{2}}{2K_{1}} > 0 \\implies 4K_{1}^{2} > (\\mu_{0}M_{s}H)^{2}$$\nSince all parameters are positive, this simplifies to:\n$$\\mu_{0}M_{s}H < 2K_{1} \\implies H < \\frac{2K_{1}}{\\mu_{0}M_{s}}$$\nThe stability of the minimum is lost when this inequality becomes an equality. This defines the critical field, known as the anisotropy field, $H_{K}$.\n$$H_{K} = \\frac{2K_{1}}{\\mu_{0}M_{s}}$$\nThe problem requests an expression for $\\mu_{0}H_{K}$. Multiplying by $\\mu_{0}$ is trivial.\n$$\\mu_{0}H_{K} = \\frac{2K_{1}}{M_{s}}$$\nAt this field, $H=H_{K}$, we have $\\sin\\theta = \\frac{\\mu_{0}M_{s}}{2K_{1}} \\left(\\frac{2K_{1}}{\\mu_{0}M_{s}}\\right) = 1$, so $\\theta = \\frac{\\pi}{2}$. The magnetization has fully aligned with the hard axis, and the energy minimum has become a point of inflection, as $\\frac{d^{2}E}{d\\theta^{2}}=0$.\n\nNext, we compute the numerical value of $\\mu_{0}H_{K}$ for the given material parameters: $K_{1} = 4\\,\\mathrm{MJ/m^{3}} = 4 \\times 10^{6}\\,\\mathrm{J/m^{3}}$ and $M_{s} = 1.2\\,\\mathrm{MA/m} = 1.2 \\times 10^{6}\\,\\mathrm{A/m}$.\n$$\\mu_{0}H_{K} = \\frac{2 \\times (4 \\times 10^{6}\\,\\mathrm{J/m^{3}})}{1.2 \\times 10^{6}\\,\\mathrm{A/m}} = \\frac{8}{1.2} \\, \\frac{\\mathrm{J/m^{3}}}{\\mathrm{A/m}}$$\nThe units are $\\frac{\\mathrm{J}}{\\mathrm{A} \\cdot \\mathrm{m}^{4}} = \\frac{\\mathrm{N} \\cdot \\mathrm{m}}{\\mathrm{A} \\cdot \\mathrm{m}^{4}} = \\frac{\\mathrm{N}}{\\mathrm{A} \\cdot \\mathrm{m}^{3}}$. This is incorrect. Re-evaluating the definition of $H_K$: $H_K=2K_1/(\\mu_0 M_s)$, thus $\\mu_0 H_K = 2K_1/M_s$. The units of $K_1$ are energy per volume, $\\mathrm{J/m^3}$. The units of $M_s$ are magnetic moment per volume, $\\mathrm{A \\cdot m^2 / m^3} = \\mathrm{A/m}$. Therefore, the units of $2K_1/M_s$ are $\\frac{\\mathrm{J/m^3}}{\\mathrm{A/m}} = \\frac{\\mathrm{J}}{\\mathrm{A \\cdot m^2}} = \\frac{\\mathrm{N \\cdot m}}{\\mathrm{A \\cdot m^2}} = \\frac{\\mathrm{N}}{\\mathrm{A \\cdot m}}$, which is the Tesla ($\\mathrm{T}$), the unit of magnetic flux density. The unit analysis is correct.\n$$\\mu_{0}H_{K} = \\frac{8}{1.2}\\,\\mathrm{T} = \\frac{80}{12}\\,\\mathrm{T} = \\frac{20}{3}\\,\\mathrm{T} \\approx 6.6666...\\,\\mathrm{T}$$\nRounding to four significant figures, the result is $6.667\\,\\mathrm{T}$.\n\nFinally, the significance of the anisotropy field must be discussed. The quantity $H_{K}$ represents the field required to saturate the magnetization along the hard axis. Crucially, it also sets the theoretical upper limit for the intrinsic coercivity, $H_{ci}$, within the framework of coherent rotation (the Stoner-Wohlfarth model). If a reversing field is applied antiparallel to the initial easy-axis magnetization, the energy barrier that prevents magnetization reversal vanishes precisely at a field strength of $H_{K}$. At this point, the magnetization becomes unstable and irreversibly switches its direction, defining the coercivity. Thus, for coherent rotation, $H_{ci} = H_{K} = \\frac{2K_{1}}{\\mu_{0}M_{s}}$. This is why high anisotropy ($K_{1}$) is a prerequisite for a high-coercivity hard magnetic material.\n\nIn practice, the coercivity of real materials is almost always lower than this theoretical maximum. This discrepancy, known as Brown's paradox, arises because coherent rotation is an energetically unfavorable reversal mechanism. Real materials contain imperfections, grain boundaries, and are not perfect single domains. Magnetization reversal typically initiates at a lower field via one of two primary mechanisms:\n1.  **Incoherent Rotation Modes:** Non-uniform reversal modes, such as curling or buckling, can occur in particles of sufficient size and require less energy, thus being triggered by smaller applied fields.\n2.  **Nucleation of Reverse Domains:** In bulk or polycrystalline materials, reversal proceeds by the nucleation of a small domain with reversed magnetization, followed by the motion of the domain wall across the grain. The field required to nucleate such a reverse domain or to unpin a domain wall from a defect is typically much smaller than $H_{K}$.\n\nTherefore, the anisotropy field $H_K$ is a fundamental material parameter that provides an ideal upper bound for coercivity, a target that can only be approached in high-quality, nanoscale, single-domain particles where incoherent modes and domain wall effects are suppressed.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\mu_0 H_K = \\frac{2K_1}{M_s}, \\quad 6.667 \\, \\text{T}}$$", "id": "2827378"}, {"introduction": "In contrast to hard magnets, soft magnetic materials are valued for their ability to change magnetization easily and with minimal energy loss.
