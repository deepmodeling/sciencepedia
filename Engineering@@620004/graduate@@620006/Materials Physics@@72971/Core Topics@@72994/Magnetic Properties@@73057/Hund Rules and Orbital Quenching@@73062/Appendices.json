It presents a standard, non-trivial problem from the physics of localized electrons in solids, requiring the application of fundamental principles of quantum mechanics, atomic physics, and magnetism. The assumptions are clearly stated and physically relevant. We shall proceed with the solution.\n\nThe problem requires a three-part analysis of a rare-earth ion with a $4f^2$ electronic configuration. First, we identify the ground-state atomic term using Hund's rules. Second, we calculate the Landé $g$-factor for this term. Third, we compute the ratio of the spin-only magnetic moment in a strong crystal field to the free-ion magnetic moment.\n\n**Part 1: Determination of the Ground-State Atomic Term**\n\nThe electronic configuration is $f^2$, which means we have two equivalent electrons in the $f$ subshell. For an $f$ electron, the orbital angular momentum quantum number is $l=3$, and the spin quantum number is $s=1/2$. The principal quantum number is $n=4$, but it does not affect the term symbol calculation.\n\nFor two equivalent electrons, the total wavefunction must be antisymmetric with respect to particle exchange, as required by the Pauli exclusion principle. The total wavefunction is a product of a spatial part and a spin part. The symmetry of the product must be antisymmetric.\nThe total spin angular momentum $S$ is obtained by coupling two spins $s_1 = s_2 = 1/2$. The possible values are $S=0$ (singlet state, spin wavefunction is antisymmetric) and $S=1$ (triplet state, spin wavefunction is symmetric).\nThe total orbital angular momentum $L$ is obtained by coupling $l_1 = l_2 = 3$. The possible integer values range from $|l_1 - l_2| = 0$ to $l_1 + l_2 = 6$, i.e., $L = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6$.\n\nWe must now apply the Pauli principle:\n1.  For the singlet state ($S=0$, antisymmetric spin part), the spatial part of the wavefunction must be symmetric. For two equivalent $l$ electrons, this corresponds to even values of the total orbital angular momentum $L$. Thus, for $S=0$, the allowed $L$ values are $L=0, 2, 4, 6$. This gives the terms $^1S$, $^1D$, $^1G$, and $^1I$.\n2.  For the triplet state ($S=1$, symmetric spin part), the spatial part must be antisymmetric. This corresponds to odd values of $L$. Thus, for $S=1$, the allowed $L$ values are $L=1, 3, 5$. This gives the terms $^3P$, $^3F$, and $^3H$.\n\nTo find the lowest-energy (ground) state term, we apply Hund's rules in sequence:\n\n*   **Hund's First Rule:** Maximize the total spin $S$. The maximum possible value of $S$ is 1. This eliminates the singlet terms and narrows our focus to the triplet terms: $^3P$, $^3F$, $^3H$.\n*   **Hund's Second Rule:** For the maximum $S$, maximize the total orbital angular momentum $L$. Comparing the triplet terms, the $L$ values are 1 ($P$), 3 ($F$), and 5 ($H$). The maximum is $L=5$. Therefore, the ground-state term is $^3H$.\n*   **Hund's Third Rule:** Determine the total angular momentum $J$. The values of $J$ are given by coupling $L$ and $S$: $J = |L-S|, |L-S|+1, \\dots, L+S$. For the $^3H$ term ($S=1, L=5$), the possible $J$ values are $J = |5-1|, \\dots, 5+1$, which are $J = 4, 5, 6$. The ground state level is determined by the subshell filling. An $f$ subshell can hold $2(2l+1) = 2(2 \\cdot 3 + 1) = 14$ electrons. The configuration $f^2$ is less than half-filled (half-filled is 7). For a less-than-half-filled shell, the state with the minimum $J$ has the lowest energy. The minimum value is $J=4$.\n\nThe lowest-energy atomic term symbol is thus $^{2S+1}L_J = {^3H_4}$. The maximum total spin is $S=1$, and the largest allowed $L$ consistent with this $S$ is $L=5$.\n\n**Part 2: Calculation of the Landé g-factor ($g_J$)**\n\nThe Landé $g$-factor, $g_J$, for a state described by quantum numbers $L$, $S$, and $J$ in the LS-coupling scheme is given by the formula:\n$$\ng_J = 1 + \\frac{J(J+1) + S(S+1) - L(L+1)}{2J(J+1)}\n$$\nFor the ground-state term $^3H_4$, we have $S=1$, $L=5$, and $J=4$. Substituting these values into the formula:\n$$\ng_J = 1 + \\frac{4(4+1) + 1(1+1) - 5(5+1)}{2 \\cdot 4(4+1)}\n$$\n$$\ng_J = 1 + \\frac{4(5) + 1(2) - 5(6)}{2 \\cdot 4(5)}\n$$\n$$\ng_J = 1 + \\frac{20 + 2 - 30}{40} = 1 + \\frac{-8}{40} = 1 - \\frac{1}{5} = \\frac{4}{5}\n$$\nThe Landé $g$-factor for the $^3H_4$ ground state is $g_J = 4/5$.\n\n**Part 3: Ratio of Magnetic Moments**\n\nThe effective magnetic moment, $\\mu_{eff}$, is a measure of the strength of the ion's paramagnetic response. It is given by $\\mu_{eff} = g \\sqrt{J_{eff}(J_{eff}+1)} \\mu_B$, where $\\mu_B$ is the Bohr magneton, $g$ is the appropriate $g$-factor, and $J_{eff}$ is the effective total angular momentum.\n\nFirst, we calculate the free-ion effective magnetic moment, $\\mu_{eff, free}$. In this limit, the magnetic properties are determined by the ground-state multiplet identified in Part 1. We use $g = g_J = 4/5$ and $J_{eff} = J = 4$.\n$$\n\\mu_{eff, free} = g_J \\sqrt{J(J+1)} \\mu_B = \\frac{4}{5} \\sqrt{4(4+1)} \\mu_B = \\frac{4}{5} \\sqrt{20} \\mu_B\n$$\nSimplifying the radical, $\\sqrt{20} = \\sqrt{4 \\cdot 5} = 2\\sqrt{5}$.\n$$\n\\mu_{eff, free} = \\frac{4}{5} (2\\sqrt{5}) \\mu_B = \\frac{8\\sqrt{5}}{5} \\mu_B\n$$\nNext, we consider the limit of a strong crystal field that completely quenches the orbital angular momentum. In this spin-only limit, the orbital contribution to the magnetic moment is nullified ($L=0$). The magnetic moment arises solely from the total spin $S$, which is unaffected by the crystal field in this approximation. The effective moment is calculated using $S$ and the free-electron $g$-factor, $g_S=2$. The relevant quantum number is $S=1$, as determined by Hund's first rule.\n$$\n\\mu_{eff, SO} = g_S \\sqrt{S(S+1)} \\mu_B = 2 \\sqrt{1(1+1)} \\mu_B = 2\\sqrt{2} \\mu_B\n$$\nFinally, we compute the required ratio $r$ of the spin-only moment to the free-ion moment:\n$$\nr = \\frac{\\mu_{eff, SO}}{\\mu_{eff, free}} = \\frac{2\\sqrt{2} \\mu_B}{\\frac{8\\sqrt{5}}{5} \\mu_B}\n$$\nThe Bohr magneton $\\mu_B$ cancels out.\n$$\nr = \\frac{2\\sqrt{2}}{\\frac{8\\sqrt{5}}{5}} = \\frac{2\\sqrt{2} \\cdot 5}{8\\sqrt{5}} = \\frac{10\\sqrt{2}}{8\\sqrt{5}} = \\frac{5\\sqrt{2}}{4\\sqrt{5}}\n$$\nTo rationalize the denominator, we multiply the numerator and denominator by $\\sqrt{5}$:\n$$\nr = \\frac{5\\sqrt{2}}{4\\sqrt{5}} \\cdot \\frac{\\sqrt{5}}{\\sqrt{5}} = \\frac{5\\sqrt{10}}{4 \\cdot 5} = \\frac{5\\sqrt{10}}{20} = \\frac{\\sqrt{10}}{4}\n$$\nThis is the final dimensionless expression for the ratio.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\frac{\\sqrt{10}}{4}}\n$$", "id": "2829013"}, {"introduction": "In reality, orbital quenching is often incomplete.

This leads to an effective Hamiltonian operator acting on the spin space:\n$$ H^{(2)}_{\\mathrm{eff}} = -2\\lambda\\mu_B \\sum_{i,j} \\left( \\sum_e \\frac{\\langle d_{xy} | L_i | e \\rangle \\langle e | L_j | d_{xy} \\rangle}{\\Delta_e} \\right) S_i B_j $$\nThis correction can be written as $\\mu_B \\mathbf{S} \\cdot \\Delta g \\cdot \\mathbf{B}$, where the tensor $\\Delta g$ has components:\n$$ \\Delta g_{ij} = -2\\lambda \\sum_e \\frac{\\langle d_{xy} | L_i | e \\rangle \\langle e | L_j | d_{xy} \\rangle}{\\Delta_e} $$\nThe total effective $g$-tensor is $g_{ij} = g_s \\delta_{ij} + \\Delta g_{ij}$.\n\nTo compute the components of $\\Delta g$, we must evaluate the matrix elements of the orbital angular momentum operators $L_x, L_y, L_z$ between the real $d$-orbitals. For a right-handed coordinate system, the actions of these operators on the ground state $\\lvert d_{xy} \\rangle$ are:\n$L_z \\lvert d_{xy} \\rangle = -2i \\lvert d_{x^2-y^2} \\rangle$\n$L_x \\lvert d_{xy} \\rangle = i \\lvert d_{xz} \\rangle$\n$L_y \\lvert d_{xy} \\rangle = -i \\lvert d_{yz} \\rangle$\nFrom these, we obtain the required matrix elements. Note that $\\langle d_{xy} \\lvert L_i \\rvert e \\rangle = (\\langle e \\lvert L_i \\rvert d_{xy} \\rangle)^*$.\nThe matrix elements are non-zero only for specific pairs of states, making the $\\Delta g$ tensor diagonal in the chosen coordinate system.\n$\\Delta g_{ij} = 0$ for $i \\neq j$.\n\nThe diagonal components are calculated as follows:\nFor $g_{\\parallel} = g_{zz}$:\n$$ \\Delta g_{zz} = -2\\lambda \\sum_e \\frac{|\\langle d_{xy} | L_z | e \\rangle|^2}{\\Delta_e} $$\nThe only excited state that couples to $\\lvert d_{xy} \\rangle$ via $L_z$ is $\\lvert d_{x^2-y^2} \\rangle$, with energy denominator $\\Delta_1$.\nThe matrix element is $\\langle d_{x^2-y^2} | L_z | d_{xy} \\rangle = -2i$. Thus $|\\langle d_{xy} | L_z | d_{x^2-y^2} \\rangle|^2 = |( -2i )^*|^2 = |2i|^2=4$.\n$$ \\Delta g_{zz} = -2\\lambda \\frac{4}{\\Delta_1} = -\\frac{8\\lambda}{\\Delta_1} $$\n$$ g_{\\parallel} = g_{zz} = g_s - \\frac{8\\lambda}{\\Delta_1} $$\n\nFor $g_{\\perp} = g_{xx} = g_{yy}$:\nFirst, we compute $g_{xx}$:\n$$ \\Delta g_{xx} = -2\\lambda \\sum_e \\frac{|\\langle d_{xy} | L_x | e \\rangle|^2}{\\Delta_e} $$\nThe only excited state coupling to $\\lvert d_{xy} \\rangle$ via $L_x$ is $\\lvert d_{xz} \\rangle$, with energy denominator $\\Delta_2$.\nThe matrix element is $\\langle d_{xz} | L_x | d_{xy} \\rangle = i$. Thus $|\\langle d_{xy} | L_x | d_{xz} \\rangle|^2 = |(i)^*|^2 = |-i|^2=1$.\n$$ \\Delta g_{xx} = -2\\lambda \\frac{1}{\\Delta_2} = -\\frac{2\\lambda}{\\Delta_2} $$\n$$ g_{xx} = g_s - \\frac{2\\lambda}{\\Delta_2} $$\n\nNext, we compute $g_{yy}$:\n$$ \\Delta g_{yy} = -2\\lambda \\sum_e \\frac{|\\langle d_{xy} | L_y | e \\rangle|^2}{\\Delta_e} $$\nThe only excited state coupling to $\\lvert d_{xy} \\rangle$ via $L_y$ is $\\lvert d_{yz} \\rangle$, with energy denominator $\\Delta_2$.\nThe matrix element is $\\langle d_{yz} | L_y | d_{xy} \\rangle = -i$. Thus $|\\langle d_{xy} | L_y | d_{yz} \\rangle|^2 = |(-i)^*|^2 = |i|^2=1$.\n$$ \\Delta g_{yy} = -2\\lambda \\frac{1}{\\Delta_2} = -\\frac{2\\lambda}{\\Delta_2} $$\n$$ g_{yy} = g_s - \\frac{2\\lambda}{\\Delta_2} $$\nAs expected from the tetragonal symmetry, $g_{xx} = g_{yy} = g_{\\perp}$.\n\nThe principal values of the effective $g$-tensor are therefore:\n$g_{\\parallel} = g_s - \\frac{8\\lambda}{\\Delta_1}$\n$g_{\\perp} = g_s - \\frac{2\\lambda}{\\Delta_2}$", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{ \\begin{pmatrix} g_s - \\frac{8\\lambda}{\\Delta_1} & g_s - \\frac{2\\lambda}{\\Delta_2} \\end{pmatrix} } $$", "id": "2829023"}]}
