This field marks the transition from the collinear easy-axis antiferromagnetic (AF) ground state to the symmetric spin-flop (SF) ground state. The transition occurs when the free energy of the SF phase becomes lower than that of the AF phase. Since this is a classical system at zero temperature, we compare the mechanical energies of the two configurations.

The magnetic field $H$ is applied along this easy axis.\n\n**1. Antiferromagnetic (AF) Phase**\n\nIn the AF phase, the spins are aligned antiparallel to each other along the easy axis $\\hat{z}$ to minimize both the exchange and anisotropy energies in the absence of a magnetic field. We can set $\\mathbf{S}_1 = S\\hat{z}$ and $\\mathbf{S}_2 = -S\\hat{z}$.\nThe components are:\n$\\mathbf{S}_1 = (0, 0, S)$\n$\\mathbf{S}_2 = (0, 0, -S)$\n\nLet's calculate the energy $E_{\\mathrm{AF}}$ for this configuration:\n- The exchange term is $2J\\, \\mathbf{S}_1 \\cdot \\mathbf{S}_2 = 2J(S)(-S) = -2JS^2$.\n- The anisotropy term is $-K(S_{1z}^2 + S_{2z}^2) = -K(S^2 + (-S)^2) = -2KS^2$.\n- The Zeeman term is $-g\\mu_{B} H(S_{1z} + S_{2z}) = -g\\mu_{B} H(S + (-S)) = 0$.\n\nThe total energy of the AF phase is constant with respect to the field:\n$$\nE_{\\mathrm{AF}} = -2JS^2 - 2KS^2\n$$\n\n**2. Spin-Flop (SF) Phase**\n\nIn the SF phase, the spins are no longer collinear with the easy axis. They cant symmetrically with respect to the easy axis to gain Zeeman energy while balancing the exchange and anisotropy costs. Due to the cylindrical symmetry around the $\\hat{z}$ axis, we can assume the spins lie in the $xz$-plane without loss of generality. A symmetric canting implies that both spins have the same component along the field direction $\\hat{z}$, and their transverse components are equal and opposite.

The Spin-Flop Transition**\n\nThe spin-flop transition occurs at the critical field $H_{\\mathrm{sf}}$ where the AF configuration ceases to be the global minimum, which for a first-order transition means the energies of the two phases become equal:\n$$\nE_{\\mathrm{AF}} = E_{\\mathrm{SF}}\n$$\n$$\n-2JS^2 - 2KS^2 = -\\frac{(g\\mu_{B} H_{\\mathrm{sf}})^2}{2(2J-K)} - 2JS^2\n$$\n$$\n-2KS^2 = -\\frac{(g\\mu_{B} H_{\\mathrm{sf}})^2}{2(2J-K)}\n$$\nSolving for $H_{\\mathrm{sf}}$:\n$$\n(g\\mu_{B} H_{\\mathrm{sf}})^2 = 2KS^2 \\cdot 2(2J-K) = 4S^2 K(2J-K)\n$$\nTaking the square root gives the magnitude of the spin-flop field:\n$$\ng\\mu_{B} H_{\\mathrm{sf}} = \\sqrt{4S^2 K(2J-K)} = 2S\\sqrt{K(2J-K)}\n$$\n$$\nH_{\\mathrm{sf}} = \\frac{2S\\sqrt{K(2J-K)}}{g\\mu_{B}}\n$$\nThis result is valid under the condition $2J-K>0$. If $K \\ge 2J$, the spin-flop phase is not stable, and the system would undergo a different type of transition (typically directly to a saturated paramagnetic state), so a spin-flop field is not defined in that regime.
