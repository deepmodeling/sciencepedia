The energy functional provided, $w(x) = A \\left(\\frac{d\\theta}{dx}\\right)^{2} + K \\sin^{2}\\theta(x)$, is composed only of the exchange and anisotropy energy terms. The magnetostatic energy density, which is proportional to $\\mu_{0}M_{s}^{2}$, arises from sources of the magnetic field, which are given by the divergence of the magnetization, $\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{M}$. For an ideal Bloch wall, the magnetization vector rotates entirely within the plane of the wall, such that $\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{M} = 0$ everywhere. The problem setup further specifies an \"effectively infinite bulk crystal\", which eliminates surface magnetic charges ($\\sigma_{m} = \\mathbf{M} \\cdot \\hat{n}$) that would otherwise exist at the sample boundaries. With no volume or surface magnetic charges, the magnetostatic energy contribution is zero. Therefore, the structure and energy of the wall are determined solely by the balance between the exchange stiffness $A$ and the anisotropy constant $K$, and are independent of $M_{s}$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{14.20}\n$$", "id": "2823475"}, {"introduction": "Building upon the concept of anisotropy, this exercise explores a more complex and technologically relevant scenario: a perpendicularly magnetized thin film.

The structure and energy of this wall are determined by a balance between the exchange energy, which favors parallel spin alignment, and the anisotropy energy, which penalizes deviations from the easy axis. The effective anisotropy $K_{\\text{eff}}$ quantifies the strength of this \"restoring force\" that holds the magnetization along the $\\hat{z}$-axis.\n\nThe anisotropy field $H_{K}$ represents the external field required to overcome the anisotropy energy barrier and destabilize a uniformly magnetized state. By dimensional analysis, $H_{K}$ is the field for which the Zeeman energy density ($\\sim \\mu_{0}M_{s}H$) becomes comparable to the anisotropy energy density barrier height ($\\sim K_{\\text{eff}}$). For any process that involves rotating the magnetization away from the easy axis against the anisotropy, $H_{K}$ is the natural field scale.\n\nIn the context of the Landau–Lifshitz–Gilbert (LLG) framework, an external field exerts a pressure on a domain wall, causing it to move and expand the energetically favorable domain. The motion of the domain wall is a dynamic process of local spin rotation. The \"stiffness\" of the spins against this rotation is dictated by $K_{\\text{eff}}$. A large $K_{\\text{eff}}$ implies a deep energy well, hence a large field $H_{K}$ is needed to induce significant change. The coercive field $H_{c}$, which is the field required to move domain walls across pinning sites (like defects), is empirically and theoretically found to be a fraction of the anisotropy field $H_{K}$.

For the given profile, this angle is $\\theta(x)$.\n$$\ne_{\\mathrm{an}} = K_u \\sin^2\\theta(x)\n$$\nThe total energy functional to be minimized is thus:\n$$\n\\sigma_w[\\theta(x)] = \\int_{-\\infty}^{+\\infty} \\left[ A \\left(\\frac{d\\theta}{dx}\\right)^2 + K_u \\sin^2\\theta(x) \\right] dx\n$$\nMinimization of this functional via the Euler-Lagrange equation leads to a first integral, which reflects the equipartition of energy densities for the stable wall profile: $e_{\\mathrm{ex}}(x) = e_{\\mathrm{an}}(x)$.\n$$\nA \\left(\\frac{d\\theta}{dx}\\right)^2 = K_u \\sin^2\\theta(x)\n$$\nTaking the square root gives a separable first-order ordinary differential equation:\n$$\n\\sqrt{A} \\frac{d\\theta}{dx} = \\sqrt{K_u} \\sin\\theta\n$$\nWe rearrange and integrate with the boundary conditions $\\theta(-\\infty)=0$ and $\\theta(+\\infty)=\\pi$.\n$$\n\\int \\frac{d\\theta}{\\sin\\theta} = \\sqrt{\\frac{K_u}{A}} \\int dx\n$$\nThe solution to this equation has the form $\\theta(x) = 2 \\arctan(\\exp(x/\\Delta))$, where the characteristic length scale $\\Delta$, known as the domain wall width parameter, is defined as:\n$$\n\\Delta = \\sqrt{\\frac{A}{K_u}}\n$$\nThe problem defines the wall width $\\delta$ as $\\delta = \\pi \\Delta$.\n$$\n\\delta = \\pi \\sqrt{\\frac{A}{K_u}}\n$$\n\nPart 2: Derivation of the Magnetostatic Exchange Length $\\ell_{\\mathrm{ex}}$\n\nThe problem defines the magnetostatic exchange length, $\\ell_{\\mathrm{ex}}$, as the length scale at which a characteristic exchange energy density equals the magnetostatic self-energy density.\n\nThe exchange energy density depends on the spatial gradient of the magnetization. For a variation over a characteristic length $\\ell$, the gradient term is of the order $|\\nabla\\mathbf{m}| \\sim 1/\\ell$. The exchange energy density is therefore approximated as:\n$$\ne_{\\mathrm{ex}} \\sim \\frac{A}{\\ell^2}\n$$\nThe magnetostatic self-energy (or demagnetizing energy) density of a uniformly magnetized body is, in order of magnitude, given by:\n$$\ne_{\\mathrm{d}} \\sim \\frac{1}{2}\\mu_0 M_s^2\n$$\nwhere $\\mu_0$ is the vacuum permeability and $M_s$ is the saturation magnetization. Equating these two energy densities, $e_{\\mathrm{ex}} = e_{\\mathrm{d}}$, at the length scale $\\ell = \\ell_{\\mathrm{ex}}$ gives:\n$$\n\\frac{A}{\\ell_{\\mathrm{ex}}^2} = \\frac{1}{2}\\mu_0 M_s^2\n$$\nSolving for $\\ell_{\\mathrm{ex}}$ yields the standard definition of the magnetostatic exchange length:\n$$\n\\ell_{\\mathrm{ex}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{2A}{\\mu_0 M_s^2}}\n$$\n\nPart 3: Calculation of the Maximum Cell Size $h_{\\max}$\n\nWe now substitute the given material parameters to find the numerical values for the length scales.\nGiven: $A = 1.5 \\times 10^{-11}\\ \\mathrm{J/m}$, $K_{u} = 5.0 \\times 10^{4}\\ \\mathrm{J/m^{3}}$, $M_{s} = 8.0 \\times 10^{5}\\ \\mathrm{A/m}$, and $\\mu_{0} = 4\\pi \\times 10^{-7}\\ \\mathrm{H/m}$.\n\nFirst, we calculate the wall width $\\delta$:\n$$\n\\delta = \\pi \\sqrt{\\frac{1.5 \\times 10^{-11}\\ \\mathrm{J/m}}{5.0 \\times 10^{4}\\ \\mathrm{J/m^{3}}}} = \\pi \\sqrt{3 \\times 10^{-16}\\ \\mathrm{m^2}} = \\pi \\sqrt{3} \\times 10^{-8}\\ \\mathrm{m} \\approx 5.4414 \\times 10^{-8}\\ \\mathrm{m}\n$$\nNext, we calculate the exchange length $\\ell_{\\mathrm{ex}}$:\n$$\n\\ell_{\\mathrm{ex}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{2 (1.5 \\times 10^{-11}\\ \\mathrm{J/m})}{(4\\pi \\times 10^{-7}\\ \\mathrm{H/m}) (8.0 \\times 10^{5}\\ \\mathrm{A/m})^2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{3 \\times 10^{-11}}{4\\pi \\times 10^{-7} \\times 6.4 \\times 10^{11}}} \\ \\mathrm{m} = \\sqrt{\\frac{3}{256\\pi}} \\times 10^{-7}\\ \\mathrm{m} \\approx 6.107 \\times 10^{-9}\\ \\mathrm{m}\n$$\nThe numerical simulation requires the cell size $h$ to satisfy two conditions:\n1. $h \\le \\delta / N_{\\delta}$, with $N_{\\delta} = 12$.\n$$\nh \\le \\frac{5.4414 \\times 10^{-8}\\ \\mathrm{m}}{12} \\approx 4.5345 \\times 10^{-9}\\ \\mathrm{m}\n$$\n2. $h \\le \\ell_{\\mathrm{ex}} / 3$.\n$$\nh \\le \\frac{6.107 \\times 10^{-9}\\ \\mathrm{m}}{3} \\approx 2.0357 \\times 10^{-9}\\ \\mathrm{m}\n$$\nThe largest admissible cell size $h_{\\max}$ must satisfy both constraints simultaneously. Therefore, it is the minimum of the two upper bounds:\n$$\nh_{\\max} = \\min(4.5345 \\times 10^{-9}\\ \\mathrm{m}, 2.0357 \\times 10^{-9}\\ \\mathrm{m}) = 2.0357 \\times 10^{-9}\\ \\mathrm{m}\n$$\nThe problem requires the answer in nanometers, rounded to three significant figures.\n$$\nh_{\\max} \\approx 2.04\\ \\mathrm{nm}\n$$\nThe more stringent condition is set by the exchange length, $h \\le \\ell_{\\mathrm{ex}} / 3$.\n\nPart 4: Justification of Numerical Method\n\nThe choice between a finite-difference method (FDM) on a structured Cartesian grid and a finite-element method (FEM) on an unstructured mesh depends heavily on the geometry of the simulation domain. The problem specifies the geometry as a \"thin, gently tapered nanoribbon of spatially varying width with smooth, curved edges.\"\n\nA finite-difference method is most naturally implemented on a structured, rectilinear grid (e.g., a Cartesian grid). Such grids are defined by orthogonal grid lines. Representing curved or non-aligned boundaries on a structured grid typically results in a \"staircase\" approximation. This artificial roughness can introduce significant numerical errors, particularly in micromagnetic simulations where surface and edge effects (demagnetization fields, boundary conditions on exchange) are physically critical. While more advanced FDM techniques exist to handle complex geometries, their implementation is non-trivial and they are not the standard approach.\n\nIn contrast, the finite-element method discretizes the domain into an unstructured mesh of simple elements, such as triangles (in $2$D) or tetrahedra (in $3$D). The principal advantage of this approach is its geometric flexibility. An unstructured mesh can conform precisely to complex shapes, including the \"tapered\" profile and \"smooth, curved edges\" of the nanoribbon. This accurate representation of the boundary is essential for correctly computing the magnetostatic field, which is long-range and highly sensitive to the shape of the magnetic body. Furthermore, FEM allows for adaptive mesh refinement, where the mesh density can be increased locally in regions of high spatial variation (such as the domain wall itself) and decreased in regions where the magnetization is uniform, leading to greater computational efficiency without sacrificing accuracy.\n\nGiven the non-rectangular, curved geometry of the nanoribbon, the finite-element method is unequivocally the more appropriate choice. It avoids the geometric approximation errors inherent in applying a standard FDM on a structured grid to such a problem and provides a much more robust and accurate framework for the simulation.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{2.04}\n$$", "id": "2823492"}]}
