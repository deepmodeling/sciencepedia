The remanent magnetization, $M_{r}$, is the ensemble average of the $z$-component of the magnetization of each particle, evaluated at zero external field ($H=0$), after prior saturation in the $+z$ direction. The magnetization of a single particle has magnitude $M_{s}$ and its orientation is described by the polar angle $\\theta$. The $z$-component of its magnetization is $M_{s}\\cos\\theta$.\n\nThe remanence is thus given by $M_{r} = \\langle M_{s} \\cos\\theta_{r}(\\alpha) \\rangle$, where $\\theta_{r}(\\alpha)$ is the remanent angle of a particle whose easy axis is at a polar angle $\\alpha$ to the $z$-axis.

The problem states that the system starts from saturation in a large positive field $H$ along the $+z$ direction, where the magnetization of every particle is aligned with the field, i.e., $\\theta \\approx 0$. Then, the field is reduced quasi-statically to $H=0$ at zero temperature. This implies that each particle's magnetization angle $\\theta$ follows the local energy minimum that is continuously connected to its initial state at $\\theta \\approx 0$.\n\nAt $H=0$, the energy density is $E(\\theta; \\alpha, 0) = K \\sin^{2}(\\theta - \\alpha)$. To find the equilibrium angles, we find the minima of this energy function.

The analysis must be performed on the descending branch of the hysteresis loop, starting from positive saturation. According to the problem statement, the magnetization $M$ remains constant at its saturation value, $M = +M_s$, until the internal magnetic field $H_{\\text{int}}$ reaches the switching threshold of $-H_k$. All calculations will be performed under this condition, with a final check to ensure the events occur prior to or at the point of magnetization reversal. All quantities are in SI units.\n\nThe fundamental relationships provided are:\nThe internal magnetic field:\n$$H_{\\text{int}} = H_{\\text{app}} - N M$$\nThe magnetic flux density (induction):\n$$B = \\mu_{0}(H_{\\text{int}} + M)$$\nThe intrinsic induction (magnetic polarization):\n$$J = \\mu_{0}M$$\n\nOn the descending branch starting from positive saturation, the magnetization is fixed at $M = +M_s$. This holds as long as the internal field $H_{\\text{int}}$ has not reached the negative switching threshold, i.e., $H_{\\text{int}} > -H_k$.\n\nFirst, we determine the apparent coercivity of induction, $H_{cB}$. This is defined as the magnitude of the reverse applied field, $H_{\\text{app}}$, at which the induction $B$ becomes zero. We set $B=0$ in its defining equation:\n$$B = \\mu_{0}(H_{\\text{int}} + M) = 0$$\nThis implies that the condition for zero induction is:\n$$H_{\\text{int}} + M = 0 \\quad \\implies \\quad H_{\\text{int}} = -M$$\nOn the descending branch, we have $M = +M_s$. Thus, the internal field at which $B=0$ is:\n$$H_{\\text{int}} = -M_s$$\nTo find the corresponding applied field, we substitute this value into the expression for the internal field:\n$$H_{\\text{int}} = H_{\\text{app}} - N M$$\n$$-M_s = H_{\\text{app}} - N(+M_s)$$\nSolving for $H_{\\text{app}}$ gives the applied field at which $B$ is zero:\n$$H_{\\text{app}} = N M_s - M_s = (N-1)M_s$$\nThe coercivity $H_{cB}$ is the magnitude of this applied field. Since the demagnetizing factor $N$ is in the range $0 \\le N \\le 1$, the term $(N-1)$ is less than or equal to zero. Therefore, $H_{\\text{app}} = (N-1)M_s$ is a non-positive value, consistent with a reverse field. The magnitude is:\n$$H_{cB} = |(N-1)M_s| = -(N-1)M_s = (1-N)M_s$$\nThis result is valid only if the magnetization has not yet switched. Switching occurs when $H_{\\text{int}} = -H_k$. The zero-crossing of $B$ occurs when $H_{\\text{int}} = -M_s$. The problem imposes the constraint $H_k \\ge M_s$, which is equivalent to $|-H_k| \\ge |-M_s|$. As $H_{\\text{app}}$ becomes more negative, $H_{\\text{int}}$ also becomes more negative. Therefore, the internal field reaches the value $-M_s$ before or at the same time it reaches $-H_k$. Thus, the magnetization is indeed $+M_s$ when $B=0$, and the calculation of $H_{cB}$ is valid.\n\nSecond, we determine the apparent intrinsic coercivity, $H_{cJ}$. This is defined as the magnitude of the reverse applied field at which the intrinsic induction $J$ becomes zero. The condition $J=0$ implies:\n$$J = \\mu_{0}M = 0 \\quad \\implies \\quad M = 0$$\nFor the specified ideal rectangular hysteresis loop, the magnetization is never zero; it switches abruptly from $M=+M_s$ to $M=-M_s$. The problem statement clarifies that $H_{cJ}$ corresponds to the applied field at which this reversal occurs. The condition for reversal on the descending branch is that the internal field reaches the negative switching threshold:\n$$H_{\\text{int}} = -H_k$$\nAt the instant just before switching, the magnetization is still $M=+M_s$.
