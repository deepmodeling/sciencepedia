It describes the double-exchange model for a two-site system, a standard and fundamental problem in magnetism. It is based on established principles of quantum mechanics and condensed matter physics.

We are to work in the limit $J_{H} \\to \\infty$. In this limit, the second term, $H_{J} = -J_{H} \\sum_{i} \\mathbf{n}_{i} \\cdot \\mathbf{s}_{i}$, dominates the energy. To minimize this energy, the spin $\\mathbf{s}_{i}$ of a conduction electron at site $i$ must be maximally aligned with the classical spin direction $\\mathbf{n}_{i}$. This constrains the allowed electronic states.\n\nAn electron at site $i$ must occupy the spin state $|\\chi_i\\rangle$ which is the eigenstate of the operator $\\mathbf{n}_i \\cdot \\boldsymbol{\\sigma}$ with the largest eigenvalue, $+1$. The single-electron Hilbert space is therefore projected onto a two-dimensional subspace spanned by the states $|1\\rangle_{\\text{eff}}$ and $|2\\rangle_{\\text{eff}}$, where an electron is localized at site $1$ or site $2$ with its spin aligned along $\\mathbf{n}_1$ or $\\mathbf{n}_2$, respectively.\n\nWe can define spinless fermion operators $f_i$ such that $|i\\rangle_{\\text{eff}} = f_i^{\\dagger} |0\\rangle$. The operators $c_{i\\sigma}$ are related to these new operators via the spin state projection. The state of an electron at site $i$ with spin along $\\mathbf{n}_i$ is created by $c_{i, \\chi_i}^{\\dagger} = \\sum_{\\sigma} \\langle \\sigma | \\chi_i \\rangle c_{i\\sigma}^{\\dagger}$. In our effective model, $f_i^\\dagger$ plays the role of $c_{i, \\chi_i}^\\dagger$.\n\nThe effective Hamiltonian, $H_{\\text{eff}}$, is obtained by projecting the hopping term, $H_t = -t \\sum_{\\sigma} (c_{1\\sigma}^{\\dagger} c_{2\\sigma} + c_{2\\sigma}^{\\dagger} c_{1\\sigma})$, onto this reduced basis $\\{|1\\rangle_{\\text{eff}}, |2\\rangle_{\\text{eff}}\\}$.

The corresponding spin-up state is $|\\chi_1\\rangle = |\\uparrow_z\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}$. Without loss of generality, $\\mathbf{n}_2$ can be placed in the $xz$-plane, so $\\mathbf{n}_2 = (\\sin\\theta, 0, \\cos\\theta)$. The state $|\\chi_2\\rangle$ is obtained by rotating $|\\chi_1\\rangle$ by an angle $\\theta$ around the $y$-axis. The spin-$\\frac{1}{2}$ rotation operator for this operation is $R_y(\\theta) = \\exp(-i\\theta \\sigma_y/2)$.\n$$ R_y(\\theta) = I \\cos(\\theta/2) - i\\sigma_y \\sin(\\theta/2) = \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos(\\theta/2)  -\\sin(\\theta/2) \\\\ \\sin(\\theta/2)  \\cos(\\theta/2) \\end{pmatrix} $$\nApplying this rotation to $|\\chi_1\\rangle$:\n$$ |\\chi_2\\rangle = R_y(\\theta) |\\chi_1\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos(\\theta/2)  -\\sin(\\theta/2) \\\\ \\sin(\\theta/2)  \\cos(\\theta/2) \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos(\\theta/2) \\\\ \\sin(\\theta/2) \\end{pmatrix} $$\nThe spinor overlap is then calculated as:\n$$ \\langle \\chi_1 | \\chi_2 \\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} 1  0 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos(\\theta/2) \\\\ \\sin(\\theta/2) \\end{pmatrix} = \\cos(\\theta/2) $$\nSince $\\theta \\in [0, \\pi]$, $\\theta/2 \\in [0, \\pi/2]$, so $\\cos(\\theta/2)$ is real and non-negative. The magnitude is $|\\cos(\\theta/2)| = \\cos(\\theta/2)$. Therefore, $\\langle \\chi_2 | \\chi_1 \\rangle = \\langle \\chi_1 | \\chi_2 \\rangle^* = \\cos(\\theta/2)$.\n\nNow, we diagonalize the effective Hamiltonian:\n$$ H_{\\text{eff}} = -t \\cos(\\theta/2) \\begin{pmatrix} 0  1 \\\\ 1  0 \\end{pmatrix} $$\nThe eigenvalues of the matrix $\\begin{pmatrix} 0  1 \\\\ 1  0 \\end{pmatrix}$ are $\\pm 1$. Thus, the energy eigenvalues of $H_{\\text{eff}}$ are:\n$$ E_{\\pm}(\\theta) = \\mp t \\cos(\\theta/2) $$\nAt zero temperature, the single electron will occupy the lowest energy state, which is the ground state. Since $t0$ and $\\cos(\\theta/2) \\geq 0$ for $\\theta \\in [0, \\pi]$, the ground-state energy is the lower eigenvalue:\n$$ E(\\theta) = -t \\cos(\\theta/2) $$\n\nThis expression for the ground-state kinetic energy $E(\\theta)$ reveals the energetic preference for the alignment of the core spins. The total energy of the system is minimized when $E(\\theta)$ is at its minimum. The function $-\\cos(\\theta/2)$ is minimized when $\\cos(\\theta/2)$ is maximized. Over the interval $\\theta \\in [0, \\pi]$, the maximum value of $\\cos(\\theta/2)$ is $1$, which occurs at $\\theta=0$. This corresponds to a parallel (ferromagnetic) alignment of the core spins $\\mathbf{n}_1$ and $\\mathbf{n}_2$. At this alignment, the ground-state energy is $E(0) = -t$. Conversely, the energy is maximized when $\\cos(\\theta/2)$ is minimized, which occurs at $\\theta=\\pi$ (antiparallel alignment), giving $E(\\pi)=0$. The kinetic energy of the itinerant electron is thus lowered by an amount $t$ when the core spins are ferromagnetically aligned compared to the perpendicular case ($\\theta=\\pi/2$) and by $t$ compared to the anti-ferromagnetic case ($\\theta=\\pi$).

The Hamiltonian for a single spin in a field $\\mathbf{h}$ is $H_1 = -\\mathbf{s} \\cdot \\mathbf{h}$. The thermal average of the spin is:\n$$\n\\langle\\mathbf{s}\\rangle = \\frac{\\int \\mathbf{s} \\exp(-\\beta H_1) d\\Omega}{\\int \\exp(-\\beta H_1) d\\Omega} = \\frac{\\int \\mathbf{s} \\exp(\\beta \\mathbf{s} \\cdot \\mathbf{h}) d\\Omega}{\\int \\exp(\\beta \\mathbf{s} \\cdot \\mathbf{h}) d\\Omega}\n$$\nwhere $\\beta = 1/(k_B T)$ and $d\\Omega$ is the element of solid angle for the unit vector $\\mathbf{s}$. For a small field $h=|\\mathbf{h}|$, we can expand the exponential to first order: $\\exp(\\beta \\mathbf{s} \\cdot \\mathbf{h}) \\approx 1 + \\beta \\mathbf{s} \\cdot \\mathbf{h}$.\n\nThe denominator, the single-spin partition function $Z_1$, becomes:\n$$\nZ_1 = \\int (1 + \\beta \\mathbf{s} \\cdot \\mathbf{h}) d\\Omega = \\int d\\Omega + \\beta \\mathbf{h} \\cdot \\int \\mathbf{s} d\\Omega\n$$\nThe integral of a vector over a symmetric sphere is zero, so $\\int \\mathbf{s} d\\Omega = 0$. The integral of $d\\Omega$ over the entire sphere is $4\\pi$. Thus, $Z_1 \\approx 4\\pi$.\n\nThe numerator is:\n$$\n\\int \\mathbf{s} (1 + \\beta \\mathbf{s} \\cdot \\mathbf{h}) d\\Omega = \\int \\mathbf{s} d\\Omega + \\beta \\int \\mathbf{s} (\\mathbf{s} \\cdot \\mathbf{h}) d\\Omega\n$$\nThe first term is zero. For the second term, let us align the coordinate system such that $\\mathbf{h}$ is along the $z$-axis, $\\mathbf{h} = h \\mathbf{\\hat{z}}$. The integrand becomes $\\beta h \\mathbf{s} s_z$. The integrals of the $x$ and $y$ components of this expression, $\\int s_x s_z d\\Omega$ and $\\int s_y s_z d\\Omega$, vanish by symmetry. Only the $z$-component survives:\n$$\n\\beta h \\mathbf{\\hat{z}} \\int s_z^2 d\\Omega\n$$\nIn spherical coordinates, $s_z = \\cos\\theta$ and $d\\Omega = \\sin\\theta d\\theta d\\phi$. The integral is:\n$$\n\\int_0^{2\\pi} d\\phi \\int_0^\\pi \\sin\\theta d\\theta \\cos^2\\theta = 2\\pi \\int_{-1}^{1} u^2 du = 2\\pi \\left[\\frac{u^3}{3}\\right]_{-1}^{1} = 2\\pi \\left(\\frac{1}{3} - \\frac{-1}{3}\\right) = \\frac{4\\pi}{3}\n$$\nSo, the numerator is $\\beta h \\mathbf{\\hat{z}} (\\frac{4\\pi}{3}) = \\frac{4\\pi\\beta}{3} \\mathbf{h}$.\n\nThe average magnetization is then:\n$$\n\\mathbf{m} = \\langle\\mathbf{s}\\rangle \\approx \\frac{\\frac{4\\pi\\beta}{3} \\mathbf{h}}{4\\pi} = \\frac{\\beta}{3}\\mathbf{h}\n$$\nFrom this, we identify the single-spin susceptibility $\\chi_0 = |\\mathbf{m}|/|\\mathbf{h}|$ as:\n$$\n\\chi_0(T) = \\frac{\\beta}{3} = \\frac{1}{3 k_B T}\n$$\nNow we substitute this into the condition for the Curie temperature:\n$$\n1 - \\frac{1}{3 k_B T_C^{\\mathrm{MF}}} Jz = 0\n$$\nSolving for $k_B T_C^{\\mathrm{MF}}$ gives the mean-field result:\n$$\nk_B T_C^{\\mathrm{MF}} = \\frac{Jz}{3}\n$$\nFor a simple cubic lattice, the coordination number is $z=6$. Substituting this value:\n$$\nk_B T_C^{\\mathrm{MF}} = \\frac{J \\cdot 6}{3} = 2J\n$$\nThe problem provides the more accurate value from high-temperature series expansions:\n$$\nk_B T_C^{\\mathrm{series}} = 1.4429 J\n$$\nWe are asked to compute the ratio $R = \\frac{T_C^{\\mathrm{MF}}}{T_C^{\\mathrm{series}}}$.\n$$\nR = \\frac{2J/k_B}{1.4429 J/k_B} = \\frac{2}{1.4429}\n$$\nPerforming the division:\n$$\nR \\approx 1.38610437313...\n$$\nRounding to four significant figures, we get $R = 1.386$. This result quantifies the characteristic overestimation of the transition temperature by mean-field theory, which neglects critical fluctuations that tend to disorder the system and lower the true $T_C$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{1.386}$$", "id": "2820680"}]}
