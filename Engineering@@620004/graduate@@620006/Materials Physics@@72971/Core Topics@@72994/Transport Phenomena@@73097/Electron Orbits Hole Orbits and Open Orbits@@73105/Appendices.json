The motion projected onto the $x$-$y$ plane is described by:\n$$\n(x(t) - x_c)^2 + (y(t) - y_c)^2 = \\left(\\frac{\\hbar k_{\\perp}}{m_b \\omega_c}\\right)^2 \\left(\\sin^2(\\omega_c t + \\phi) + \\cos^2(\\omega_c t + \\phi)\\right) = \\left(\\frac{\\hbar k_{\\perp}}{m_b \\omega_c}\\right)^2\n$$\nThis is the equation for a circle of radius $R = \\frac{\\hbar k_{\\perp}}{m_b \\omega_c}$. The electron particle executes circular motion in the plane perpendicular to the magnetic field, combined with uniform motion along the field direction (helical motion). The angular frequency of this circular motion in real space is, by inspection of the arguments of the trigonometric functions, equal to $\\omega_c$.\n\nTherefore, the angular frequency of the cyclotron orbit in $\\mathbf{k}$-space, $\\omega_c = \\frac{eB}{m_b}$, is identical to the angular frequency of the cyclotron orbit in real space for this system.

The eigenstates are plane waves, $\\psi_\\mathbf{k}(\\mathbf{r}) \\propto \\exp(i\\mathbf{k}\\cdot\\mathbf{r})$. The periodic part of the Bloch wavefunction, $|u_\\mathbf{k}\\rangle$, can be chosen as a constant, independent of $\\mathbf{k}$.

The Fermi surface for holes surrounds the origin in $k$-space, enclosing the Dirac point, just as for electrons.
