It is well-posed, scientifically grounded, and contains sufficient information for a unique solution. We will proceed with the derivation.\n\nThe problem is divided into two parts. First, we must establish the relationship between fluxes in the laboratory frame and the lattice frame. Second, we must derive an explicit expression for the lattice velocity, known as the Kirkendall velocity.\n\nFor the first part, we consider the flux of species $A$. The laboratory-frame flux, $\\tilde J_A$, is the total rate at which atoms of species $A$ cross a fixed plane in the laboratory. This total flux is composed of two contributions: $1$) the flux of $A$ relative to the moving lattice, which is the intrinsic flux $J_A^*$, and $2$) the convective flux of $A$ atoms being carried along with the moving lattice itself.\n\nThe local concentration of species $A$ is $c_A(x,t) = c_t N_A(x,t)$, where $c_t$ is the constant total lattice-site concentration and $N_A$ is the site fraction of $A$. The lattice itself moves with a local velocity $v(x,t)$. The convective flux is therefore the concentration of species $A$ multiplied by this velocity, which is $c_A v$.\n\nBy definition, the flux in the fixed laboratory frame is the sum of the flux relative to the moving frame (the lattice) and the convective flux due to the motion of that frame. Thus, we have:\n$$ \\tilde J_A = J_A^* + c_A v $$\nSubstituting $c_A = c_t N_A$, we arrive at the relationship for species $A$:\n$$ \\tilde J_A = J_A^* + c_t N_A v $$\nAn analogous relation holds for species $B$:\n$$ \\tilde J_B = J_B^* + c_t N_B v $$\nThis completes the first part of the problem.\n\nFor the second part, we must find an expression for the lattice velocity $v$. The problem states that we must use the principle of conservation of lattice sites for a substitutional alloy with constant total site concentration $c_t$. This physical constraint implies that there is no net creation or destruction of lattice sites. In the laboratory frame, this means there is no net volume flow, or equivalently, no net atomic flux across any plane. This is expressed as the condition that the sum of the total laboratory-frame fluxes of all species is zero. For a binary alloy, this condition is:\n$$ \\tilde J_A + \\tilde J_B = 0 $$\nWe substitute the expressions for $\\tilde J_A$ and $\\tilde J_B$ derived above into this conservation equation:\n$$ (J_A^* + c_t N_A v) + (J_B^* + c_t N_B v) = 0 $$\nWe can group terms to solve for the velocity $v$:\n$$ J_A^* + J_B^* + v (c_t N_A + c_t N_B) = 0 $$\nUsing the fact that the total concentration of sites is $c_t = c_A + c_B = c_t N_A + c_t N_B$, which is also $c_t(N_A + N_B)$, and since $N_A + N_B = 1$, the term in parentheses simplifies to $c_t$.\n$$ J_A^* + J_B^* + v c_t = 0 $$\nSolving for $v$ yields:\n$$ v = - \\frac{J_A^* + J_B^*}{c_t} $$\nNow, we must introduce the Fickian constitutive laws for the intrinsic fluxes. The intrinsic flux of species $i$ relative to the lattice is given by Fick's first law: $J_i^* = -D_i \\frac{\\partial c_i}{\\partial x}$. Since the total site concentration $c_t$ is constant, we can write $c_A = c_t N_A$ and $c_B = c_t N_B$. The derivatives are:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial c_A}{\\partial x} = c_t \\frac{\\partial N_A}{\\partial x} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\frac{\\partial c_B}{\\partial x} = c_t \\frac{\\partial N_B}{\\partial x} $$\nThus, the intrinsic fluxes are:\n$$ J_A^* = -D_A c_t \\frac{\\partial N_A}{\\partial x} $$\n$$ J_B^* = -D_B c_t \\frac{\\partial N_B}{\\partial x} $$\nFrom the constraint that site fractions sum to unity, $N_A + N_B = 1$, it follows that their spatial gradients must sum to zero:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial N_A}{\\partial x} + \\frac{\\partial N_B}{\\partial x} = 0 \\implies \\frac{\\partial N_B}{\\partial x} = - \\frac{\\partial N_A}{\\partial x} $$\nSubstituting this into the expression for $J_B^*$:\n$$ J_B^* = -D_B c_t \\left( - \\frac{\\partial N_A}{\\partial x} \\right) = D_B c_t \\frac{\\partial N_A}{\\partial x} $$\nWe now substitute the expressions for $J_A^*$ and $J_B^*$ in terms of the gradient of $N_A$ into our equation for $v$:\n$$ v = - \\frac{1}{c_t} \\left( -D_A c_t \\frac{\\partial N_A}{\\partial x} + D_B c_t \\frac{\\partial N_A}{\\partial x} \\right) $$\nThe constant $c_t$ cancels out from the numerator and denominator:\n$$ v = - \\left( -D_A \\frac{\\partial N_A}{\\partial x} + D_B \\frac{\\partial N_A}{\\partial x} \\right) $$\nFactoring out the common term $\\frac{\\partial N_A}{\\partial x}$:\n$$ v = - (D_B - D_A) \\frac{\\partial N_A}{\\partial x} $$\nFinally, distributing the negative sign, we obtain the expression for the Kirkendall marker velocity:\n$$ v = (D_A - D_B) \\frac{\\partial N_A}{\\partial x} $$\nThis result shows that a non-zero lattice velocity, and thus the Kirkendall effect, arises from a difference in the intrinsic diffusivities of the two species ($D_A \\neq D_B$) in the presence of a composition gradient ($\\frac{\\partial N_A}{\\partial x} \\neq 0$).

The problem is valid for a rigorous scientific treatment.\n\nThe task is to identify the correct description for determining the Matano plane, $x_M$, starting from the principle of mass conservation. The governing equation for one-dimensional diffusion with a composition-dependent interdiffusion coefficient, $\\tilde{D}(C_A)$, is Fick's second law, which is a statement of local mass conservation:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial C_A}{\\partial t} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} \\left( \\tilde{D}(C_A) \\frac{\\partial C_A}{\\partial x} \\right)\n$$\nFor a semi-infinite diffusion couple, the solution to this partial differential equation takes a form where concentration $C_A$ is a function of a single variable, $\\eta$. The Boltzmann transformation proposes such a variable, but its origin must be chosen carefully to satisfy mass conservation over the whole domain. This origin is, by definition, the Matano plane, $x_M$. Let us define the transformation as $\\eta = (x - x_M)/\\sqrt{t}$. Substituting this into the diffusion equation transforms the PDE into an ordinary differential equation:\n$$\n-\\frac{\\eta}{2} \\frac{dC_A}{d\\eta} = \\frac{d}{d\\eta} \\left( \\tilde{D}(C_A) \\frac{dC_A}{d\\eta} \\right)\n$$\nThe position of the Matano plane $x_M$ is fixed by the global mass conservation constraint.

It does not depend on time $t$ explicitly (though the profile $x(C_A)$ evolves with time such that $x_M/\\sqrt{t}$ is constant), nor on the interdiffusion coefficient $\\tilde{D}$, nor, crucially, on any marker displacement. The existence of a Kirkendall shift means there is a net flux of atoms across the original interface, causing a physical movement of markers placed there.

Let us instead integrate by parts on the formula given in this option.\nStart with the left-hand side of the equation in option A: $\\int_{-\\infty}^{x_M} (C_A(x) - C_A^-) dx$. Use integration by parts with $u = C_A(x) - C_A^-$ and $dv = dx$, so $v = x$.\n$$\n\\int_{-\\infty}^{x_M} (C_A - C_A^-) dx = \\left[x(C_A - C_A^-)\\right]_{-\\infty}^{x_M} - \\int_{C_A^-}^{C_A(x_M)} x \\, dC_A\n$$\nThe boundary term at $x \\to -\\infty$ is zero because $(C_A - C_A^-) \\to 0$ faster than $1/x$ grows. So, the LHS is $x_M(C_A(x_M) - C_A^-) - \\int_{C_A^-}^{C_A(x_M)} x \\, dC_A$.\nSimilarly, for the right-hand-side: $\\int_{x_M}^{+\\infty} (C_A^+ - C_A(x)) dx$. Use integration by parts with $u = C_A^+ - C_A(x)$ and $dv = dx$, so $v=x$.\n$$\n\\int_{x_M}^{+\\infty} (C_A^+ - C_A) dx = \\left[x(C_A^+ - C_A)\\right]_{x_M}^{+\\infty} - \\int_{C_A(x_M)}^{C_A^+} x (-dC_A)\n$$\nThe boundary term at $x \\to +\\infty$ is zero. So, the RHS is $-x_M(C_A^+ - C_A(x_M)) + \\int_{C_A(x_M)}^{C_A^+} x \\, dC_A$.\nEquating the two sides:\n$$\nx_M C_A(x_M) - x_M C_A^- - \\int_{C_A^-}^{C_A(x_M)} x \\, dC_A = -x_M C_A^+ + x_M C_A(x_M) + \\int_{C_A(x_M)}^{C_A^+} x \\, dC_A\n$$\n$$\nx_M(C_A^+ - C_A^-) = \\int_{C_A^-}^{C_A(x_M)} x \\, dC_A + \\int_{C_A(x_M)}^{C_A^+} x \\, dC_A = \\int_{C_A^-}^{C_A^+} x \\, dC_A\n$$\nRearranging gives $\\int_{C_A^-}^{C_A^+} [x(C_A) - x_M] \\, dC_A = 0$, which is the definition derived from first principles. Therefore, option A is an equivalent and correct definition. The statement that $x_M$ is determined solely by $C_A(x,t)$ and $C_A^\\pm$ is also correct.\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\n**B. The Matano plane necessarily coincides with the Kirkendall marker plane in any binary system, so its position must be determined from the observed marker displacement.**\n\nThis is incorrect. The Kirkendall plane is located at the position of inert markers originally placed at the $x=0$ interface. Its displacement is a physical consequence of the inequality of the intrinsic diffusion coefficients ($D_A \\neq D_B$). The Matano plane is a computationally convenient reference plane derived from the concentration profile to satisfy mass balance in the Boltzmann-Matano analysis. The two planes coincide only in the special case where $D_A = D_B$, where there is no Kirkendall effect. The problem states that a finite Kirkendall shift is observed, which implies $D_A \\neq D_B$ and therefore the Matano plane and Kirkendall plane do not coincide.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**C. Equivalently, if $x$ is treated as a function of composition along the monotone profile, $x = x(C_A)$, then $x_M$ is determined by the condition\n$$\n\\int_{C_A^-}^{C_A^+}\\!\\big[x(C_A) - x_M\\big]\\,dC_A \\;=\\; 0,\n$$\nwhich depends only on the measured profile and is independent of any marker displacement.**\n\nAs shown in the initial derivation from the governing diffusion equation, this is the fundamental definition of the Matano plane that ensures the validity of the Boltzmann transformation. The formula itself shows that $x_M$ is solved for using only the function $x(C_A)$, which is the inverse of the concentration profile $C_A(x,t)$. Thus, its determination is purely mathematical from the profile data and is independent of marker experiments.\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\n**D. Determining the Matano plane requires prior knowledge of the composition dependence of the interdiffusion coefficient $\\tilde{D}(C_A)$, because $x_M$ appears only after $\\tilde{D}(C_A)$ is evaluated.**\n\nThis reverses the logic of the Boltzmann-Matano analysis. The procedure is as follows:\n1. Measure the concentration profile $C_A(x,t)$.\n2. Determine the position of the Matano plane $x_M$ using the integral definitions given in options A or C. This step does not require knowledge of $\\tilde{D}(C_A)$.\n3. Use the now-known $x_M$ in the Boltzmann-Matano equation to calculate $\\tilde{D}(C_A)$:\n$$\n\\tilde{D}(C') = - \\frac{1}{2t} \\left(\\frac{dx}{dC_A}\\right)_{C=C'} \\int_{C_A^-}^{C'} (x - x_M) \\, dC_A\n$$\nTherefore, $x_M$ is a prerequisite for finding $\\tilde{D}(C_A)$, not the other way around.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**E. If the intrinsic diffusivities of $A$ and $B$ are unequal, the Matano plane cannot be obtained from $C_A(x,t)$ alone and must be corrected using the Kirkendall marker shift measured in a separate experiment.**\n\nThis is incorrect. As established in the analysis of options A and C, the Matano plane's position $x_M$ is defined and calculated exclusively from the concentration profile $C_A(x,t)$ and its boundary conditions. The inequality of intrinsic diffusivities ($D_A \\neq D_B$) is the physical reason for the Kirkendall shift, which causes the Kirkendall plane $x_K$ to differ from the Matano plane $x_M$. However, this physical phenomenon does not alter the mathematical definition or the method of finding $x_M$. The analysis of the profile via the Matano construction is valid and self-contained, regardless of the magnitude of the Kirkendall shift. No \"correction\" using the marker shift is needed to find $x_M$; rather, the difference between $x_M$ and $x_K$ is itself a quantity of interest in a more detailed (Darken) analysis.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{AC}$$", "id": "2832842"}, {"introduction": "The final challenge is to synthesize theory and analytical methods into a practical, quantitative application.

The analysis will be performed within the Darken formalism, starting from the given fundamental principles.\n\nFirst, the givens and assumptions are validated. The problem is scientifically grounded in established models of solid-state diffusion, well-posed with sufficient and consistent information, and objectively stated. The numerical values provided are physically plausible for the specified system. The problem is therefore deemed valid and a solution will be constructed.\n\nThe solution proceeds in three parts as specified: derivation of key analytical relations, followed by their computational implementation.\n\n**1. Derivation of the Kirkendall Marker Velocity ($v_{\\mathrm{K}}$)**\n\nThe analysis begins with the principle of local site conservation in the laboratory reference frame, which states that the sum of component fluxes is zero:\n$$ J_{\\mathrm{Si}} + J_{\\mathrm{Fe}} = 0 $$\nThe fluxes in the laboratory frame, $J_i$, are related to the intrinsic fluxes in the lattice (marker) frame, $J_i^*$, by the Galilean transformation, accounting for the drift velocity of the lattice, $v_{\\mathrm{K}}$:\n$$ J_i = J_i^* + N_i C v_{\\mathrm{K}} $$\nwhere $N_i$ is the mole fraction of component $i$ and $C$ is the total molar concentration of lattice sites. Substituting this into the conservation equation yields:\n$$ (J_{\\mathrm{Si}}^* + N_{\\mathrm{Si}} C v_{\\mathrm{K}}) + (J_{\\mathrm{Fe}}^* + N_{\\mathrm{Fe}} C v_{\\mathrm{K}}) = 0 $$\nRearranging the terms gives:\n$$ J_{\\mathrm{Si}}^* + J_{\\mathrm{Fe}}^* + (N_{\\mathrm{Si}} + N_{\\mathrm{Fe}}) C v_{\\mathrm{K}} = 0 $$\nFor a binary alloy, the sum of mole fractions is unity, $N_{\\mathrm{Si}} + N_{\\mathrm{Fe}} = 1$. This simplifies the expression to:\n$$ J_{\\mathrm{Si}}^* + J_{\\mathrm{Fe}}^* + C v_{\\mathrm{K}} = 0 $$\nSolving for the Kirkendall velocity $v_{\\mathrm{K}}$:\n$$ v_{\\mathrm{K}} = -\\frac{1}{C} (J_{\\mathrm{Si}}^* + J_{\\mathrm{Fe}}^*) $$\nThe intrinsic fluxes are given by Fick's first law in the lattice frame: $J_{\\mathrm{Si}}^{*} = -D_{\\mathrm{Si}} C (\\partial N_{\\mathrm{Si}}/\\partial x)$ and $J_{\\mathrm{Fe}}^{*} = -D_{\\mathrm{Fe}} C (\\partial N_{\\mathrm{Fe}}/\\partial x)$. Substituting these expressions:\n$$ v_{\\mathrm{K}} = -\\frac{1}{C} \\left(-D_{\\mathrm{Si}} C \\frac{\\partial N_{\\mathrm{Si}}}{\\partial x} - D_{\\mathrm{Fe}} C \\frac{\\partial N_{\\mathrm{Fe}}}{\\partial x}\\right) = D_{\\mathrm{Si}} \\frac{\\partial N_{\\mathrm{Si}}}{\\partial x} + D_{\\mathrm{Fe}} \\frac{\\partial N_{\\mathrm{Fe}}}{\\partial x} $$\nFrom the constraint $N_{\\mathrm{Si}} + N_{\\mathrm{Fe}} = 1$, it follows that their gradients are related by $\\partial N_{\\mathrm{Si}}/\\partial x + \\partial N_{\\mathrm{Fe}}/\\partial x = 0$, or $\\partial N_{\\mathrm{Fe}}/\\partial x = -\\partial N_{\\mathrm{Si}}/\\partial x$. Substituting this gives the final relation for the marker velocity, often called Darken's second relation:\n$$ v_{\\mathrm{K}} = D_{\\mathrm{Si}} \\frac{\\partial N_{\\mathrm{Si}}}{\\partial x} - D_{\\mathrm{Fe}} \\frac{\\partial N_{\\mathrm{Si}}}{\\partial x} = (D_{\\mathrm{Si}} - D_{\\mathrm{Fe}}) \\frac{\\partial N_{\\mathrm{Si}}}{\\partial x} $$\n\n**2. Derivation of the Intrinsic Diffusivity ($D_{\\mathrm{Si}}$)**\n\nWe have derived one equation relating the intrinsic diffusivities to measurable quantities. A second, independent equation is the Darken relation for the interdiffusion coefficient, $\\tilde D$:\n$$ \\tilde D = N_{\\mathrm{Fe}} D_{\\mathrm{Si}} + N_{\\mathrm{Si}} D_{\\mathrm{Fe}} $$\nUsing the shorthand $N \\equiv N_{\\mathrm{Si}}$ and $g \\equiv \\partial N_{\\mathrm{Si}}/\\partial x$, our system of two equations is:\n$$ (1) \\quad v_{\\mathrm{K}} = (D_{\\mathrm{Si}} - D_{\\mathrm{Fe}}) g $$\n$$ (2) \\quad \\tilde D = (1-N) D_{\\mathrm{Si}} + N D_{\\mathrm{Fe}} $$\nFrom equation (1), we express $D_{\\mathrm{Fe}}$ in terms of $D_{\\mathrm{Si}}$:\n$$ D_{\\mathrm{Fe}} = D_{\\mathrm{Si}} - \\frac{v_{\\mathrm{K}}}{g} $$\nSubstitute this expression for $D_{\\mathrm{Fe}}$ into equation (2):\n$$ \\tilde D = (1-N) D_{\\mathrm{Si}} + N \\left( D_{\\mathrm{Si}} - \\frac{v_{\\mathrm{K}}}{g} \\right) $$\nNow, we solve for $D_{\\mathrm{Si}}$. Expanding and collecting terms:\n$$ \\tilde D = (1-N) D_{\\mathrm{Si}} + N D_{\\mathrm{Si}} - N \\frac{v_{\\mathrm{K}}}{g} $$\n$$ \\tilde D = ((1-N) + N) D_{\\mathrm{Si}} - N \\frac{v_{\\mathrm{K}}}{g} $$\n$$ \\tilde D = D_{\\mathrm{Si}} - N \\frac{v_{\\mathrm{K}}}{g} $$\nIsolating $D_{\\mathrm{Si}}$ yields the desired expression:\n$$ D_{\\mathrm{Si}}(N) = \\tilde D(N) + N \\frac{v_{\\mathrm{K}}}{g} $$\nThis equation allows for the direct calculation of $D_{\\mathrm{Si}}$ at a specific composition $N$ from the measured interdiffusivity $\\tilde D$, marker velocity $v_{\\mathrm{K}}$, and composition gradient $g$.\n\n**3. Uncertainty Propagation for $D_{\\mathrm{Si}}$**\n\nThe standard uncertainty in $D_{\\mathrm{Si}}$, denoted $u(D_{\\mathrm{Si}})$ or $\\sigma_{D_{\\mathrm{Si}}}$, is found using first-order Taylor expansion (linear error propagation). Assuming the input measured quantities ($\\tilde D$, $N$, $v_{\\mathrm{K}}$, $g$) are uncorrelated, the variance of $D_{\\mathrm{Si}}$ is the sum of the squared partial derivatives weighted by the variances of the inputs:\n$$ \\sigma_{D_{\\mathrm{Si}}}^2 = \\left(\\frac{\\partial D_{\\mathrm{Si}}}{\\partial \\tilde D}\\right)^2 \\sigma_{\\tilde D}^2 + \\left(\\frac{\\partial D_{\\mathrm{Si}}}{\\partial N}\\right)^2 \\sigma_{N}^2 + \\left(\\frac{\\partial D_{\\mathrm{Si}}}{\\partial v_{\\mathrm{K}}}\\right)^2 \\sigma_{v_{\\mathrm{K}}}^2 + \\left(\\frac{\\partial D_{\\mathrm{Si}}}{\\partial g}\\right)^2 \\sigma_{g}^2 $$\nThe required partial derivatives are:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial D_{\\mathrm{Si}}}{\\partial \\tilde D} = 1 $$\n$$ \\frac{\\partial D_{\\mathrm{Si}}}{\\partial N} = \\frac{v_{\\mathrm{K}}}{g} $$\n$$ \\frac{\\partial D_{\\mathrm{Si}}}{\\partial v_{\\mathrm{K}}} = \\frac{N}{g} $$\n$$ \\frac{\\partial D_{\\mathrm{Si}}}{\\partial g} = -N \\frac{v_{\\mathrm{K}}}{g^2} $$\nThe marker velocity $v_{\\mathrm{K}}$ is approximated by $v_{\\mathrm{K}} \\approx (x_1 - x_0) / (t_1 - t_0)$. Since times $t_0$ and $t_1$ are exact and positions $x_0$ and $x_1$ are independent random variables with uncertainties $\\sigma_{x0}$ and $\\sigma_{x1}$, the variance of $v_{\\mathrm{K}}$ is:\n$$ \\sigma_{v_{\\mathrm{K}}}^2 = \\frac{\\sigma_{x_0}^2 + \\sigma_{x_1}^2}{(t_1 - t_0)^2} $$\nSubstituting these into the variance formula for $D_{\\mathrm{Si}}$ gives:\n$$ \\sigma_{D_{\\mathrm{Si}}}^2 = \\sigma_{\\tilde D}^2 + \\left(\\frac{v_{\\mathrm{K}}}{g}\\right)^2 \\sigma_{N}^2 + \\left(\\frac{N}{g}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{\\sigma_{x_0}^2 + \\sigma_{x_1}^2}{(t_1-t_0)^2}\\right) + \\left(-N \\frac{v_{\\mathrm{K}}}{g^2}\\right)^2 \\sigma_{g}^2 $$\nThe standard uncertainty is the square root of this variance, $u(D_{\\mathrm{Si}}) = \\sqrt{\\sigma_{D_{\\mathrm{Si}}}^2}$.\n\nThese derived formulae are implemented in the following program to process the provided test cases.
