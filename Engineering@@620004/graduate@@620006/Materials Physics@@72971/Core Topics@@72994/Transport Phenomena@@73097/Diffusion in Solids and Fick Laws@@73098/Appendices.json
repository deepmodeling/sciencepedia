For a scalar field $c(r, t)$ that depends only on the radial coordinate $r$ and time $t$, the gradient is given by $\\nabla c = \\dfrac{\\partial c}{\\partial r} \\hat{r}$. The flux vector is then purely radial: $\\vec{J} = J_r(r,t) \\hat{r} = -D \\dfrac{\\partial c}{\\partial r} \\hat{r}$.\n\nThe divergence of a radially symmetric vector field $\\vec{A} = A_r(r) \\hat{r}$ in $n$ spatial dimensions is given by the general formula:\n$$ \\nabla \\cdot \\vec{A} = \\dfrac{1}{r^{n-1}} \\dfrac{\\partial}{\\partial r} (r^{n-1} A_r) $$\nwhere $n=2$ for cylindrical symmetry (in a plane, or for a long cylinder) and $n=3$ for spherical symmetry.\n\nApplying this formula to the flux vector $\\vec{J}$:\n$$ \\nabla \\cdot \\vec{J} = \\dfrac{1}{r^{n-1}} \\dfrac{\\partial}{\\partial r} \\left( r^{n-1} \\left(-D \\dfrac{\\partial c}{\\partial r}\\right) \\right) = -\\dfrac{1}{r^{n-1}} \\dfrac{\\partial}{\\partial r} \\left( r^{n-1} D \\dfrac{\\partial c}{\\partial r} \\right) $$\nSubstituting this into the continuity equation $\\dfrac{\\partial c}{\\partial t} = -\\nabla \\cdot \\vec{J}$ gives the general PDE for radially symmetric diffusion:\n$$ \\dfrac{\\partial c}{\\partial t} = \\dfrac{1}{r^{n-1}} \\dfrac{\\partial}{\\partial r} \\left( r^{n-1} D \\dfrac{\\partial c}{\\partial r} \\right) $$\nFor the specific geometries:\n-   **Cylindrical symmetry ($n=2$)**:\n    $$ \\dfrac{\\partial c}{\\partial t} = \\dfrac{1}{r} \\dfrac{\\partial}{\\partial r} \\left( r D \\dfrac{\\partial c}{\\partial r} \\right) $$\n-   **Spherical symmetry ($n=3$)**:\n    $$ \\dfrac{\\partial c}{\\partial t} = \\dfrac{1}{r^2} \\dfrac{\\partial}{\\partial r} \\left( r^2 D \\dfrac{\\partial c}{\\partial r} \\right) $$\n\nIf the diffusion coefficient $D$ is a constant, it can be moved outside the spatial derivative:\n-   **Cylindrical ($D$ constant)**: $\\dfrac{\\partial c}{\\partial t} = \\dfrac{D}{r} \\dfrac{\\partial}{\\partial r} \\left( r \\dfrac{\\partial c}{\\partial r} \\right) = D \\left( \\dfrac{\\partial^2 c}{\\partial r^2} + \\dfrac{1}{r} \\dfrac{\\partial c}{\\partial r} \\right)$.\n-   **Spherical ($D$ constant)**: $\\dfrac{\\partial c}{\\partial t} = \\dfrac{D}{r^2} \\dfrac{\\partial}{\\partial r} \\left( r^2 \\dfrac{\\partial c}{\\partial r} \\right) = D \\left( \\dfrac{\\partial^2 c}{\\partial r^2} + \\dfrac{2}{r} \\dfrac{\\partial c}{\\partial r} \\right)$.\n\nNext, we determine the boundary condition at the center of symmetry, $r=0$. The problem states we must prevent unphysical singularities. At the axis of a cylinder or the center of a sphere, there can be no sink or source of matter. This means the total flux of matter passing through a surface enclosing the origin must vanish as the surface shrinks to a point. The total flux is $\\Phi = \\int_{\\partial V} \\vec{J} \\cdot d\\vec{S}$. For a cylinder of radius $r$ and length $L$, the surface area of the side is $A = 2\\pi rL$. For a sphere of radius $r$, the surface area is $A=4\\pi r^2$. In general, the area scales as $r^{n-1}$.\nThe total flux is $\\Phi = A \\cdot J_r = (\\text{const}) \\cdot r^{n-1} J_r$. The condition of no central source/sink requires $\\lim_{r\\to 0} \\Phi = 0$.\nThis implies the fundamental regularity condition:\n$$ \\lim_{r \\to 0} \\left( r^{n-1} J_r \\right) = 0 $$\nSubstituting $J_r = -D \\dfrac{\\partial c}{\\partial r}$, we get:\n$$ \\lim_{r \\to 0} \\left( r^{n-1} D \\dfrac{\\partial c}{\\partial r} \\right) = 0 $$\nThe problem states that $D$ is smooth and bounded near $r=0$. Furthermore, for a physically realistic, smooth concentration profile, the concentration $c(r,t)$ must be an even function with respect to $r=0$ due to symmetry (i.e., $c(r) = c(-r)$), meaning its derivative with respect to $r$ must be an odd function. Any differentiable odd function $f(x)$ must satisfy $f(0)=0$. Therefore, the gradient of concentration must be zero at the center of symmetry:\n$$ \\left. \\dfrac{\\partial c}{\\partial r} \\right|_{r=0} = 0 $$\nThis condition ensures the concentration profile is smooth (no cusp) at the origin and also satisfies the zero-flux condition for any $n1$ and bounded $D$. This is the correct boundary condition stemming from physical regularity and symmetry.\n\nNow, we evaluate the given options.\n\n**A. For constant $D$, cylindrical symmetry obeys $\\dfrac{\\partial c}{\\partial t} = D \\dfrac{1}{r}\\dfrac{\\partial}{\\partial r}\\!\\left(r \\dfrac{\\partial c}{\\partial r}\\right)$ and spherical symmetry obeys $\\dfrac{\\partial c}{\\partial t} = D \\dfrac{1}{r^{2}}\\dfrac{\\partial}{\\partial r}\\!\\left(r^{2} \\dfrac{\\partial c}{\\partial r}\\right)$. In both cases, the regularity condition at $r=0$ is $\\left.\\dfrac{\\partial c}{\\partial r}\\right|_{r=0}=0$.**\nThe PDEs stated are the correct forms for constant $D$ in cylindrical ($n=2$) and spherical ($n=3$) coordinates, as derived above. The boundary condition $\\left.\\dfrac{\\partial c}{\\partial r}\\right|_{r=0}=0$ is also correct, as it enforces symmetry and zero flux at the origin.\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\n**B. For constant $D$, cylindrical symmetry obeys $\\dfrac{\\partial c}{\\partial t} = -\\,D \\dfrac{1}{r}\\dfrac{\\partial}{\\partial r}\\!\\left(r \\dfrac{\\partial c}{\\partial r}\\right)$ and spherical symmetry obeys $\\dfrac{\\partial c}{\\partial t} = -\\,D \\dfrac{1}{r^{2}}\\dfrac{\\partial}{\\partial r}\\!\\left(r^{2} \\dfrac{\\partial c}{\\partial r}\\right)$. At $r=0$, impose $\\left.c\\right|_{r=0}$ finite.**\nThe PDEs have an incorrect negative sign. The combination of the minus sign in Fick's law and the minus sign from moving $\\nabla \\cdot \\vec{J}$ to the other side of the continuity equation results in a positive sign. The condition that concentration is finite is a consequence of the correct boundary condition, not the boundary condition itself.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**C. For space- and composition-dependent $D=D(r,c,t)$, cylindrical symmetry obeys $\\dfrac{\\partial c}{\\partial t} = \\dfrac{\\partial}{\\partial r}\\!\\left(D \\dfrac{\\partial c}{\\partial r}\\right)$ and spherical symmetry obeys $\\dfrac{\\partial c}{\\partial t} = \\dfrac{\\partial}{\\partial r}\\!\\left(D \\dfrac{\\partial c}{\\partial r}\\right)$. At $r=0$, impose $\\left.\\dfrac{\\partial c}{\\partial r}\\right|_{r=0}=0$.**\nThe PDEs are incorrect. They represent the diffusion equation in one-dimensional Cartesian coordinates, not cylindrical or spherical coordinates. The geometric factors $r^{n-1}$ have been omitted from the divergence operator.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. For constant $D$, cylindrical symmetry obeys $\\dfrac{\\partial c}{\\partial t} = D\\!\\left(\\dfrac{\\partial^{2} c}{\\partial r^{2}} + \\dfrac{1}{r}\\dfrac{\\partial c}{\\partial r}\\right)$ and spherical symmetry obeys $\\dfrac{\\partial c}{\\partial t} = D\\!\\left(\\dfrac{\\partial^{2} c}{\\partial r^{2}} + \\dfrac{2}{r}\\dfrac{\\partial c}{\\partial r}\\right)$. To avoid singular behavior at $r=0$, impose $\\left.c\\right|_{r=0}=0$.**\nThe PDEs are the correct expanded forms for constant $D$, as shown in the initial derivation. However, the proposed boundary condition $\\left.c\\right|_{r=0}=0$ is a specific Dirichlet condition. It is not a general regularity condition derived from symmetry. It implies that the concentration at the origin is fixed at zero, which is not generally true and would require a physical mechanism (a perfect sink) to maintain. The correct general condition is zero gradient.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**E. For $D=D(r,c,t)$ smooth and bounded near $r=0$, the general $n$-dimensional radially symmetric form $\\dfrac{\\partial c}{\\partial t} = \\dfrac{1}{r^{n-1}}\\dfrac{\\partial}{\\partial r}\\!\\left(r^{n-1} D \\dfrac{\\partial c}{\\partial r}\\right)$ applies, with $n=2$ for cylindrical and $n=3$ for spherical symmetry.

It also states the fundamental boundary condition in terms of zero flux, $\\lim_{r\\to 0} r^{n-1} D \\dfrac{\\partial c}{\\partial r} = 0$. Crucially, it correctly explains that this condition, combined with the physical requirement of a smooth solution profile (for which $D$ must be bounded), is equivalent to imposing the zero-gradient condition $\\left.\\dfrac{\\partial c}{\\partial r}\\right|_{r=0}=0$. This is the most complete and rigorous statement among the options.\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\nSince the problem allows for multiple correct options to be selected, and both A and E are factually correct statements describing the physics, both are valid answers. Option A is a correct description of the special case of constant $D$, while Option E is a correct description of the general case which includes constant $D$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{AE}$$", "id": "2814552"}, {"introduction": "The diffusion coefficient, $D$, is not merely a phenomenological parameter; it is a direct consequence of atomic-scale processes.

It represents a standard, albeit simplified, model of tracer self-diffusion in a crystalline solid, which is a fundamental topic in materials physics. All necessary parameters and physical constants are provided, and the required assumptions are explicitly stated. Therefore, we may proceed with a formal derivation and solution.\n\nThe problem asks for an explicit expression for the tracer diffusivity, $D^{\\ast}(T)$, derived from first principles, and its subsequent numerical evaluation. We shall construct the argument in a logical sequence, beginning with the connection between macroscopic diffusion and the microscopic random walk of atoms.\n\nFirst, we define diffusivity macroscopically. For diffusion under a concentration gradient, Fick's first law states that the flux of tracer atoms, $J^{\\ast}$, is proportional to the negative of the concentration gradient, $\\nabla C^{\\ast}$. The constant of proportionality is the tracer diffusion coefficient, or diffusivity, $D^{\\ast}$.\n$$J^{\\ast} = -D^{\\ast} \\nabla C^{\\ast}$$\nOur goal is to derive a microscopic expression for this phenomenological coefficient, $D^{\\ast}$.\n\nThe microscopic picture of diffusion is a random walk. For a particle executing a random walk in three dimensions, the mean-square displacement, $\\langle R^2 \\rangle$, after a time $t$ is related to the diffusivity by the Einstein-Smoluchowski relation:\n$$\\langle R^2 \\rangle = 6 D t$$\nIn our case, the diffusing entities are tracer atoms, so we have $\\langle R^2 \\rangle = 6 D^{\\ast} t$. The mean-square displacement can also be expressed in terms of the number of jumps, $n$, and the length of each jump, $l$. For a truly random walk, $\\langle R^2 \\rangle = n l^2$. However, in vacancy-mediated diffusion, the jumps are not uncorrelated. After an atom jumps into a vacancy, there is a higher-than-random probability that its next jump will be back into the same vacancy, as the vacancy is now located at the site the atom just vacated. This backward correlation reduces the net displacement. This effect is quantified by the tracer correlation factor, $f$. For tracer self-diffusion via the vacancy mechanism in an FCC lattice, the problem provides $f = 0.7815$. The corrected expression for the mean-square displacement of the tracer atom is:\n$$\\langle R^2 \\rangle = f n l^2$$\nThe total number of jumps, $n$, made by a single tracer atom in time $t$ is $n = \\Gamma t$, where $\\Gamma$ is the average jump frequency of that atom. Substituting this into the previous equation gives:\n$$\\langle R^2 \\rangle = f \\Gamma t l^2$$\nBy equating the microscopic and macroscopic expressions for $\\langle R^2 \\rangle$, we find the relationship between $D^{\\ast}$ and the microscopic jump parameters:\n$$6 D^{\\ast} t = f \\Gamma t l^2$$\n$$D^{\\ast} = \\frac{1}{6} f \\Gamma l^2$$\nThis expression is fundamental, but incomplete. We must now determine the jump frequency $\\Gamma$ and the jump distance $l$.\n\nThe jump distance, $l$, is the nearest-neighbor distance in the FCC lattice. In an FCC unit cell with lattice parameter $a$, atoms touch along the face diagonal. The length of the face diagonal is $a\\sqrt{2}$. This distance corresponds to twice the nearest-neighbor distance, $2l$.\n$$2l = a\\sqrt{2} \\implies l = \\frac{a}{\\sqrt{2}}$$\nTherefore, $l^2 = \\frac{a^2}{2}$.\n\nThe average jump frequency of a specific tracer atom, $\\Gamma$, is the product of three factors: ($1$) the number of nearest-neighbor sites, which is the coordination number $z$; ($2$) the probability, $X_v$, that any given neighboring site is occupied by a vacancy; and ($3$) the rate, $\\omega$, at which an atom successfully exchanges positions with an adjacent vacancy.\n$$\\Gamma = z X_v \\omega$$\nWe must now derive expressions for $X_v$ and $\\omega$.\n\nThe equilibrium vacancy concentration (atomic fraction), $X_v = n_v / (N+n_v)$ where $n_v$ is the number of vacancies and $N$ is the number of atoms, is determined by minimizing the Gibbs free energy of the crystal with respect to $n_v$. The change in free energy upon introducing $n_v$ vacancies is $\\Delta G = n_v H_v - T\\Delta S$, where $H_v$ is the vacancy formation enthalpy. The entropy change has two parts: a configurational term $S_{conf}$ from arranging the vacancies, and a non-configurational (vibrational) term, which the problem instructs us to neglect.\nThe configurational entropy is given by the Boltzmann formula $S_{conf} = k_B \\ln W$, where $W$ is the number of ways to arrange $n_v$ vacancies on $N_{sites} = N+n_v$ lattice sites:\n$$W = \\binom{N+n_v}{n_v} = \\frac{(N+n_v)!}{N! n_v!}$$\nThe free energy to be minimized is thus:\n$$\\Delta G(n_v) = n_v H_v - k_B T \\ln\\left(\\frac{(N+n_v)!}{N! n_v!}\\right)$$\nTo find the equilibrium $n_v$, we set the derivative with respect to $n_v$ to zero: $\\frac{\\partial(\\Delta G)}{\\partial n_v} = 0$. Using Stirling's approximation for the derivative of a factorial, $\\frac{d(\\ln x!)}{dx} \\approx \\ln x$, we obtain:\n$$H_v - k_B T \\left[ \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial n_v} (\\ln((N+n_v)!) - \\ln(n_v!)) \\right] = 0$$\n$$H_v - k_B T \\left[ \\ln(N+n_v) - \\ln(n_v) \\right] = 0$$\n$$H_v = k_B T \\ln\\left(\\frac{N+n_v}{n_v}\\right) = k_B T \\ln\\left(\\frac{1}{X_v}\\right)$$\nSolving for the vacancy fraction $X_v$:\n$$X_v = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{H_v}{k_B T}\\right)$$\nThe probability that a neighbor site is vacant is simply $X_v$.\n\nNext, we address the jump rate $\\omega$. An atom adjacent to a vacancy can jump into it if it has sufficient thermal energy to overcome the energy barrier for migration, $E_m$. This process is modeled using an Arrhenius expression, where the rate is the product of a vibrational attempt frequency, $\\nu$, and a Boltzmann factor representing the probability of having the required activation energy:\n$$\\omega = \\nu \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_m}{k_B T}\\right)$$\nNow we assemble all the pieces. Substituting the expressions for $\\Gamma$, $X_v$, $\\omega$, and $l^2$ into our equation for $D^{\\ast}$:\n$$D^{\\ast} = \\frac{1}{6} f l^2 \\Gamma = \\frac{1}{6} f \\left(\\frac{a^2}{2}\\right) (z X_v \\omega)$$\n$$D^{\\ast} = \\frac{1}{12} f z a^2 \\left( \\exp\\left(-\\frac{H_v}{k_B T}\\right) \\right) \\left( \\nu \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_m}{k_B T}\\right) \\right)$$\nCombining the exponential terms, we arrive at the final explicit expression for the tracer diffusivity:\n$$D^{\\ast}(T) = \\frac{1}{12} f z \\nu a^2 \\exp\\left(-\\frac{H_v + E_m}{k_B T}\\right)$$\nThis expression takes the classic Arrhenius form $D^{\\ast} = D_0 \\exp(-Q/k_B T)$, where the pre-exponential factor is $D_0 = \\frac{1}{12} f z \\nu a^2$ and the activation energy for diffusion is $Q = H_v + E_m$.\n\nFinally, we evaluate this expression numerically using the provided parameters:\n$f = 0.7815$\n$z = 12$ (for FCC)\n$\\nu = 5.0 \\times 10^{12}\\,\\text{s}^{-1}$\n$a = 3.60 \\times 10^{-10}\\,\\text{m}$\n$H_v = 1.10\\,\\text{eV}$\n$E_m = 0.65\\,\\text{eV}$\n$T = 1000\\,\\text{K}$\n$k_B = 8.617333262 \\times 10^{-5}\\,\\text{eV}\\,\\text{K}^{-1}$\n\nFirst, calculate the activation energy $Q$:\n$$Q = H_v + E_m = 1.10\\,\\text{eV} + 0.65\\,\\text{eV} = 1.75\\,\\text{eV}$$\nNext, calculate the dimensionless exponent $Q / (k_B T)$:\n$$\\frac{Q}{k_B T} = \\frac{1.75\\,\\text{eV}}{(8.617333262 \\times 10^{-5}\\,\\text{eV}\\,\\text{K}^{-1})(1000\\,\\text{K})} \\approx 20.3073$$\nNow compute the Boltzmann factor:\n$$\\exp\\left(-\\frac{Q}{k_B T}\\right) = \\exp(-20.3073) \\approx 1.5159 \\times 10^{-9}$$\nThen compute the pre-exponential factor, $D_0$:\n$$D_0 = \\frac{1}{12} f z \\nu a^2 = \\frac{1}{12} (0.7815) (12) (5.0 \\times 10^{12}\\,\\text{s}^{-1}) (3.60 \\times 10^{-10}\\,\\text{m})^2$$\n$$D_0 = (0.7815) (5.0 \\times 10^{12}\\,\\text{s}^{-1}) (1.296 \\times 10^{-19}\\,\\text{m}^2)$$\n$$D_0 = 5.06412 \\times 10^{-7}\\,\\text{m}^2\\,\\text{s}^{-1}$$\nFinally, we compute $D^{\\ast}(T=1000\\,\\text{K})$:\n$$D^{\\ast} = D_0 \\exp\\left(-\\frac{Q}{k_B T}\\right) = (5.06412 \\times 10^{-7}\\,\\text{m}^2\\,\\text{s}^{-1}) (1.5159 \\times 10^{-9})$$\n$$D^{\\ast} \\approx 7.6766 \\times 10^{-16}\\,\\text{m}^2\\,\\text{s}^{-1}$$\nRounding the result to three significant figures, we obtain the final answer.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{7.68 \\times 10^{-16}}$$", "id": "2814557"}, {"introduction": "In many real systems, particularly binary alloys, the constituent atomic species do not diffuse at the same rate.

Starting from the continuity equation and Fick’s laws in the lattice frame, derive the relations that connect the interdiffusion coefficient $\\tilde{D}$, the intrinsic diffusion coefficients $D_A$ and $D_B$, the mole fractions $N_A$ and $N_B=1-N_A$, and the Kirkendall velocity $v$ at a given position $x$ and time $t$. Clearly state any assumptions you invoke in the derivation.\n\n2. Using the provided fit for $N_A(x,t)$, determine the best-estimate value of the interdiffusion coefficient $\\tilde{D}$ and evaluate the local composition $N_A$ and composition gradient $\\partial N_A/\\partial x$ at the marker position $x=x_m$.\n\n3. Combine your results to compute the best-estimate values of the intrinsic diffusion coefficients $D_A$ and $D_B$ at the marker-plane composition. Express both $D_A$ and $D_B$ in $\\mathrm{m}^2\\mathrm{/s}$.\n\n4. Treat the uncertainties in $t$, $\\lambda$, and $x_m$ as independent and Gaussian. Using first-order (linear) uncertainty propagation, derive analytic expressions for the standard uncertainties of $D_A$ and $D_B$ in terms of the partial derivatives with respect to $t$, $\\lambda$, and $x_m$, and evaluate their numerical values.\n\nRound your best-estimate values of $D_A$ and $D_B$ to three significant figures and express them in $\\mathrm{m}^2\\mathrm{/s}$. Any angles, if they appear, must be in radians. Report all intermediate and final uncertainties as one-standard-deviation values, rounded to two significant figures. The final numeric answer you provide should be the pair $\\{D_A, D_B\\}$.", "solution": "The problem is well-posed and scientifically grounded within the established framework of solid-state diffusion theory.

It is a standard application of Darken's analysis to a binary diffusion couple, a cornerstone topic in materials physics. The provided mole fraction profile is the correct functional form for diffusion with a constant interdiffusion coefficient, and the boundary condition values derived from the fit ($N_A(-\\infty) = 0.5-0.3=0.2$ and $N_A(+\\infty)=0.5+0.3=0.8$) match the initial conditions. The problem is well-posed, objective, and contains sufficient information for a unique solution.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. A complete solution is warranted.\n\n**Part 1: Derivation of Darken's Relations**\nWe consider one-dimensional diffusion in a binary substitutional solid solution ($A$, $B$) with a constant total molar concentration $C = C_A + C_B$. The analysis is performed in two reference frames: the laboratory frame, fixed to the ends of the diffusion couple, and the lattice (or marker) frame, which moves with a local velocity $v_k$ (the Kirkendall velocity) relative to the lab frame.\n\nThe flux $J_i$ of species $i$ in the lab frame is the sum of its diffusive flux $j_i$ in the lattice frame and a convective term due to lattice motion:\n$$J_A = j_A + C_A v_k$$\n$$J_B = j_B + C_B v_k$$\nThe diffusive fluxes in the lattice frame are given by Fick's first law using the intrinsic diffusion coefficients $D_A$ and $D_B$:\n$$j_A = -D_A \\frac{\\partial C_A}{\\partial x}$$\n$$j_B = -D_B \\frac{\\partial C_B}{\\partial x}$$\nThe assumption of constant molar volume ($C_A + C_B = C = \\text{constant}$) implies that $\\frac{\\partial C_A}{\\partial x} + \\frac{\\partial C_B}{\\partial x} = 0$.\n\nIn the lab frame, for a closed system with no sources or sinks, the total flux of atoms across any plane must be zero: $J_A + J_B = 0$. Substituting the expressions for $J_A$ and $J_B$:\n$$(j_A + C_A v_k) + (j_B + C_B v_k) = 0$$\n$$(-D_A \\frac{\\partial C_A}{\\partial x}) + (-D_B \\frac{\\partial C_B}{\\partial x}) + (C_A + C_B)v_k = 0$$\nUsing $\\frac{\\partial C_B}{\\partial x} = -\\frac{\\partial C_A}{\\partial x}$ and $C_A+C_B=C$:\n$$-D_A \\frac{\\partial C_A}{\\partial x} + D_B \\frac{\\partial C_A}{\\partial x} + C v_k = 0$$\nSolving for the Kirkendall velocity $v_k$:\n$$v_k = (D_A - D_B) \\frac{1}{C} \\frac{\\partial C_A}{\\partial x}$$\nUsing mole fractions $N_A = C_A/C$ and $N_B = C_B/C$, and noting that $C$ is constant, $\\frac{\\partial C_A}{\\partial x} = C \\frac{\\partial N_A}{\\partial x}$. The first relation is:\n$$v_k = (D_A - D_B) \\frac{\\partial N_A}{\\partial x}$$\nThe overall diffusion process in the lab frame is described phenomenologically by Fick's laws using an interdiffusion coefficient $\\tilde{D}$. The flux of species $A$ is $J_A = -\\tilde{D} \\frac{\\partial C_A}{\\partial x}$. Equating this with the expression for $J_A$ in terms of intrinsic properties:\n$$-\\tilde{D} \\frac{\\partial C_A}{\\partial x} = J_A = j_A + C_A v_k = -D_A \\frac{\\partial C_A}{\\partial x} + C_A v_k$$\nSubstituting the derived expression for $v_k$:\n$$-\\tilde{D} \\frac{\\partial C_A}{\\partial x} = -D_A \\frac{\\partial C_A}{\\partial x} + C_A (D_A - D_B) \\frac{1}{C} \\frac{\\partial C_A}{\\partial x}$$\nAssuming $\\frac{\\partial C_A}{\\partial x} \\ne 0$, we divide through by $-\\frac{\\partial C_A}{\\partial x}$:\n$$\\tilde{D} = D_A - \\frac{C_A}{C}(D_A - D_B) = D_A - N_A(D_A - D_B)$$\n$$\\tilde{D} = D_A(1 - N_A) + D_B N_A = D_A N_B + D_B N_A$$\nThis is Darken's first equation. The two main relations are:\n$1$. $\\tilde{D} = N_A D_B + N_B D_A$\n$2$. $v_k = (D_A - D_B) \\frac{\\partial N_A}{\\partial x}$\n\n**Part 2: Calculation of $\\tilde{D}$, $N_A(x_m)$, and $\\frac{\\partial N_A}{\\partial x}|_{x_m}$**\nThe solution to the diffusion equation $\\frac{\\partial N_A}{\\partial t} = \\tilde{D} \\frac{\\partial^2 N_A}{\\partial x^2}$ for a semi-infinite couple is $N_A(x,t) = \\frac{N_A^+ + N_A^-}{2} + \\frac{N_A^+ - N_A^-}{2} \\operatorname{erf}\\!(\\frac{x}{2\\sqrt{\\tilde{D}t}})$.\nComparing this to the given fit $N_A(x,t) = 0.50 + 0.30 \\, \\operatorname{erf}\\!\\left(\\frac{x}{\\lambda}\\right)$, we identify $\\lambda = 2\\sqrt{\\tilde{D}t}$.\nThe interdiffusion coefficient $\\tilde{D}$ is thus:\n$$\\tilde{D} = \\frac{\\lambda^2}{4t} = \\frac{(1.60 \\times 10^{-4} \\ \\mathrm{m})^2}{4 \\times 36000 \\ \\mathrm{s}} = \\frac{2.56 \\times 10^{-8} \\ \\mathrm{m}^2}{144000 \\ \\mathrm{s}} \\approx 1.7778 \\times 10^{-13} \\ \\mathrm{m}^2/\\mathrm{s}$$\nAt the marker position $x_m = 22.0 \\times 10^{-6} \\ \\mathrm{m}$, the composition $N_A(x_m)$ is:\n$$N_A(x_m) = 0.50 + 0.30 \\, \\operatorname{erf}\\!\\left(\\frac{22.0 \\times 10^{-6}}{1.60 \\times 10^{-4}}\\right) = 0.50 + 0.30 \\, \\operatorname{erf}(0.1375)$$\nUsing $\\operatorname{erf}(0.1375) \\approx 0.154178$, we find:\n$$N_A(x_m) \\approx 0.50 + 0.30(0.154178) \\approx 0.54625$$\nThe composition gradient $\\frac{\\partial N_A}{\\partial x}$ is found by differentiating the profile:\n$$\\frac{\\partial N_A}{\\partial x} = 0.30 \\frac{d}{dx}\\left[\\operatorname{erf}\\!\\left(\\frac{x}{\\lambda}\\right)\\right] = 0.30 \\cdot \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{\\pi}} \\exp\\!\\left(-\\left(\\frac{x}{\\lambda}\\right)^2\\right) \\cdot \\frac{1}{\\lambda} = \\frac{0.6}{\\lambda\\sqrt{\\pi}} \\exp\\!\\left(-\\left(\\frac{x}{\\lambda}\\right)^2\\right)$$\nEvaluating at $x=x_m$:\n$$\\left.\\frac{\\partial N_A}{\\partial x}\\right|_{x_m} = \\frac{0.6}{(1.60 \\times 10^{-4})\\sqrt{\\pi}} \\exp\\!\\left(-(0.1375)^2\\right) \\approx 2115.69 \\times \\exp(-0.01890625) \\approx 2075.94 \\ \\mathrm{m}^{-1}$$\n\n**Part 3: Calculation of $D_A$ and $D_B$**\nFor a diffusion process described by a Boltzmann transformation ($y=x/\\sqrt{t}$), the instantaneous velocity of a marker initially at $x=0$ is related to its position $x_m$ at time $t$ by $v_k = x_m / (2t)$.\n$$v_k = \\frac{22.0 \\times 10^{-6} \\ \\mathrm{m}}{2 \\times 36000 \\ \\mathrm{s}} \\approx 3.0556 \\times 10^{-10} \\ \\mathrm{m/s}$$\nWe now have a system of two linear equations for $D_A$ and $D_B$ at the marker plane composition:\n$$1.7778 \\times 10^{-13} = (1-0.54625)D_A + 0.54625 D_B$$\n$$3.0556 \\times 10^{-10} = (D_A - D_B) \\times 2075.94$$\nFrom the second equation, the difference in intrinsic diffusivities is:\n$$D_A - D_B = \\frac{3.0556 \\times 10^{-10} \\ \\mathrm{m/s}}{2075.94 \\ \\mathrm{m}^{-1}} \\approx 1.4721 \\times 10^{-13} \\ \\mathrm{m}^2/\\mathrm{s}$$\nFrom Darken's first relation, $D_A = \\tilde{D} + N_A(D_A - D_B)$:\n$$D_A = 1.7778 \\times 10^{-13} + 0.54625 \\times (1.4721 \\times 10^{-13})$$\n$$D_A \\approx (1.7778 + 0.8042) \\times 10^{-13} = 2.582 \\times 10^{-13} \\ \\mathrm{m}^2/\\mathrm{s}$$\nAnd $D_B = D_A - (D_A - D_B)$:\n$$D_B = 2.582 \\times 10^{-13} - 1.4721 \\times 10^{-13} = 1.110 \\times 10^{-13} \\ \\mathrm{m}^2/\\mathrm{s}$$\nRounding to three significant figures, we get $D_A = 2.58 \\times 10^{-13} \\ \\mathrm{m}^2/\\mathrm{s}$ and $D_B = 1.11 \\times 10^{-13} \\ \\mathrm{m}^2/\\mathrm{s}$.\n\n**Part 4: Uncertainty Propagation**\nThe standard uncertainty $\\sigma_f$ of a function $f(q_1, q_2, \\dots)$ is given by $\\sigma_f^2 = \\sum_i (\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial q_i} \\sigma_{q_i})^2$ for independent variables $q_i$.
