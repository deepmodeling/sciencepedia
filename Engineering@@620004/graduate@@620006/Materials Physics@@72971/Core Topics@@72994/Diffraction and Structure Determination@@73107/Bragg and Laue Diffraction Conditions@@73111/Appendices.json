We will proceed with the derivation from first principles as requested.\n\nThe first step is to establish the primitive lattice vectors for the direct and reciprocal lattices of a simple cubic (SC) structure. For an SC lattice with lattice parameter $a$, the primitive direct lattice vectors $\\mathbf{a}_i$ can be conveniently chosen to be aligned with a Cartesian coordinate system:\n$$\n\\mathbf{a}_1 = a\\hat{x}, \\quad \\mathbf{a}_2 = a\\hat{y}, \\quad \\mathbf{a}_3 = a\\hat{z}\n$$\nwhere $\\hat{x}$, $\\hat{y}$, and $\\hat{z}$ are orthonormal basis vectors.\n\nThe primitive reciprocal lattice vectors $\\mathbf{b}_j$ are defined by the relation $\\mathbf{a}_i \\cdot \\mathbf{b}_j = 2\\pi\\delta_{ij}$, where $\\delta_{ij}$ is the Kronecker delta.

This corresponds to the smallest nonzero value of the sum of squares of integers, $h^2 + k^2 + l^2$. The case $(h,k,l)=(0,0,0)$ gives $\\mathbf{G} = \\mathbf{0}$, which corresponds to the undiffracted beam ($q=0$).

Validation:**\nThe problem is scientifically grounded in the principles of X-ray crystallography. It is well-posed, providing sufficient data to distinguish between the proposed structures. The language is objective and precise. The physical scenario and data are realistic. The core of the problem lies in applying the concept of the structure factor and the associated selection rules for different Bravais lattices. The problem is valid.\n\n### Step 2: Derivation and Analysis\n\nThe fundamental principle for determining the crystal structure from diffraction data is the analysis of the structure factor, $F_{hkl}$. For a crystal with a basis, the structure factor for a reflection indexed by Miller indices $(h,k,l)$ is given by:\n$$F_{hkl} = \\sum_{j=1}^{N} f_j e^{i 2\\pi (h x_j + k y_j + l z_j)}$$\nwhere the sum is over all $N$ atoms in the unit cell, $(x_j, y_j, z_j)$ are the fractional coordinates of the $j$-th atom, and $f_j$ is its atomic form factor. The intensity of the diffracted beam is proportional to $|F_{hkl}|^2$.\n\nA key diagnostic tool is the presence or absence of certain reflections due to destructive interference from atoms at specific positions. These are known as systematic extinctions or selection rules, which are characteristic of the Bravais lattice. For cubic lattices indexed on a conventional cell:\n- **Simple Cubic (SC):** All $(h,k,l)$ reflections are allowed.\n- **Body-Centered Cubic (BCC):** Reflections are allowed only if the sum $h+k+l$ is an even integer.\n- **Face-Centered Cubic (FCC):** Reflections are allowed only if the indices $h,k,l$ are all even or all odd (i.e., not of mixed parity).\n\nThe experimental data show non-zero intensities for the $(100)$ and $(110)$ reflections: $I_{100} = 1.00$ and $I_{110} = 3.58$. The presence of these reflections provides a powerful constraint on the possible Bravais lattice.\n\n- For the $(100)$ reflection: $h=1, k=0, l=0$. The indices are of mixed parity. Also, the sum $h+k+l=1$ is odd.\n- For the $(110)$ reflection: $h=1, k=1, l=0$. The indices are of mixed parity. The sum $h+k+l=2$ is even.\n\nThe observation of a non-zero $(100)$ intensity proves that the Bravais lattice cannot be BCC (since $h+k+l$ is odd) and cannot be FCC (since the indices are of mixed parity). Therefore, the underlying Bravais lattice must be simple cubic.\n\nWe now evaluate each option based on this conclusion.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A) Rock-salt (NaCl-type): face-centered cubic Bravais lattice with a two-atom basis.**\nThe rock-salt structure is based on an FCC Bravais lattice. According to the FCC selection rules, reflections are forbidden if the Miller indices $(h,k,l)$ are of mixed parity. Both $(100)$ and $(110)$ have mixed-parity indices. Therefore, for an NaCl-type structure, the intensities $I_{100}$ and $I_{110}$ must be zero. The experimental data show $I_{100}=1.00$ and $I_{110}=3.58$. This is a direct contradiction.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**B) Cesium chloride (CsCl-type): simple cubic Bravais lattice with a two-atom basis at $(0,0,0)$ and $(\\tfrac{1}{2},\\tfrac{1}{2},\\tfrac{1}{2})$.**\nThis structure is based on a simple cubic (SC) Bravais lattice. An SC lattice does not have any systematic extinctions based on the parity of $(h,k,l)$. Therefore, the observation of $(100)$, $(110)$, and $(111)$ reflections is permitted. Let's perform a quantitative check.\nThe basis consists of atom A at $(0,0,0)$ and atom B at $(\\tfrac{1}{2},\\tfrac{1}{2},\\tfrac{1}{2})$. Their atomic form factors are $f_A$ and $f_B$. The structure factor is:\n$$F_{hkl} = f_A e^{i 2\\pi (0)} + f_B e^{i 2\\pi (h/2 + k/2 + l/2)} = f_A + f_B e^{i \\pi (h+k+l)}$$\nWe analyze two cases for the sum $h+k+l$:\n- If $h+k+l$ is even: $F_{hkl} = f_A + f_B$.\n- If $h+k+l$ is odd: $F_{hkl} = f_A - f_B$.\n\nThe intensities are proportional to $|F_{hkl}|^2$:\n- For $(100)$: $h+k+l=1$ (odd). $I_{100} \\propto |f_A(q_{100}) - f_B(q_{100})|^2$.\n- For $(110)$: $h+k+l=2$ (even). $I_{110} \\propto |f_A(q_{110}) + f_B(q_{110})|^2$.\n- For $(111)$: $h+k+l=3$ (odd). $I_{111} \\propto |f_A(q_{111}) - f_B(q_{111})|^2$.\n\nThe theory predicts that the intensities $I_{100}$ and $I_{111}$ should be nearly equal, as both are proportional to $|f_A - f_B|^2$. The atomic form factors $f_j(q)$ decrease with increasing scattering vector magnitude $q = (2\\pi/a)\\sqrt{h^2+k^2+l^2}$, so we expect $I_{111}$ to be slightly smaller than $I_{100}$.\nThe experimental data are $I_{100} = 1.00$ and $I_{111} = 1.02$. These values are equal to within $2\\%$, which is well within the stated experimental uncertainty of $5\\%$. The slight discrepancy from the theoretical expectation ($I_{111} < I_{100}$) is negligible given the uncertainty.\n\nThe intensity ratio $\\frac{I_{110}}{I_{100}}$ provides a further check. Neglecting the small dependence of form factors on $q$ for this qualitative check, the ratio is:\n$$\\frac{I_{110}}{I_{100}} \\approx \\frac{|f_A + f_B|^2}{|f_A - f_B|^2} = \\frac{3.58}{1.00} = 3.58$$\nTaking the square root gives $\\frac{|f_A + f_B|}{|f_A - f_B|} \\approx \\sqrt{3.58} \\approx 1.89$. Assuming $f_A$ and $f_B$ are real and positive, and letting $r = f_B/f_A$, we get $\\frac{1+r}{1-r} \\approx 1.89$, which yields a ratio of form factors $r \\approx 0.31$. This is a physically reasonable value for an ionic crystal AB.\nThe CsCl structure is fully consistent with the experimental data.\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\n**C) Body-centered cubic of a single element (one atom per primitive cell; identical scatterers).**\nThis structure is based on a BCC Bravais lattice. The selection rule for BCC is that $h+k+l$ must be even.\n- For $(100)$, $h+k+l=1$ (odd), so this reflection is forbidden.\n- For $(111)$, $h+k+l=3$ (odd), so this reflection is forbidden.\nThe model predicts $I_{100}=0$ and $I_{111}=0$, which contradicts the data ($I_{100}=1.00$, $I_{111}=1.02$). Furthermore, this option contradicts the problem statement that the crystal is a \"binary ionic crystal AB,\" not a single element.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**D) Zinc blende (ZnS-type): face-centered cubic Bravais lattice with a two-atom basis at $(0,0,0)$ and $(\\tfrac{1}{4},\\tfrac{1}{4},\\tfrac{1}{4})$.**\nLike the rock-salt structure, the zinc blende structure is based on an FCC Bravais lattice. The selection rules are the same: reflections are forbidden for mixed-parity indices. As established for option A, the observation of reflections $(100)$ and $(110)$ with non-zero intensity rules out an FCC Bravais lattice.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe presence of the $(100)$ reflection, which has mixed-parity indices $(1,0,0)$ and an odd sum $h+k+l=1$, definitively rules out any structure based on an FCC or BCC Bravais lattice. This eliminates options A, C, and D. Option B, the CsCl structure, is based on a simple cubic Bravais lattice, which allows the $(100)$, $(110)$, and $(111)$ reflections. Further quantitative analysis shows that the relative intensities of these peaks are consistent with the CsCl structure for a binary ionic compound.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2981778"}]}
