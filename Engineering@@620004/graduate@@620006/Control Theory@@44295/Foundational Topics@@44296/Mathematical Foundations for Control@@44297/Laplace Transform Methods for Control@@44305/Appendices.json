A solution will now be derived.\n\nThe problem requires the solution of the differential equation $\\dot{x}(t)+x(t)=u(t-2)$ with the initial condition $x(0^{+})=1$. We will apply the unilateral Laplace transform, denoted by $\\mathcal{L}\\{\\cdot\\}$, to the equation. Let $X(s) = \\mathcal{L}\\{x(t)\\}$.\n\nThe Laplace transform of the derivative $\\dot{x}(t)$ is given by the property $\\mathcal{L}\\{\\dot{x}(t)\\} = sX(s) - x(0^{+})$. Substituting the given initial condition $x(0^{+})=1$, we have:\n$$ \\mathcal{L}\\{\\dot{x}(t)\\} = sX(s) - 1 $$\nThe Laplace transform of $x(t)$ is simply $X(s)$.\n\nThe Laplace transform of the left-hand side of the differential equation is therefore:\n$$ \\mathcal{L}\\{\\dot{x}(t) + x(t)\\} = (sX(s) - 1) + X(s) = (s+1)X(s) - 1 $$\nNext, we determine the Laplace transform of the right-hand side, $u(t-2)$. The Laplace transform of the Heaviside step function $u(t)$ is $\\mathcal{L}\\{u(t)\\} = \\frac{1}{s}$. Using the time-shifting property, $\\mathcal{L}\\{f(t-a)u(t-a)\\} = \\exp(-as)F(s)$, where $F(s)=\\mathcal{L}\\{f(t)\\}$. In our case, the function is $u(t-2)$, which can be seen as $f(t-2)u(t-2)$ with $f(t)=1$ for $t \\ge 0$, or more directly as a time-shifted $u(t)$. The transform is:\n$$ \\mathcal{L}\\{u(t-2)\\} = \\exp(-2s) \\mathcal{L}\\{u(t)\\} = \\frac{\\exp(-2s)}{s} $$\nEquating the transforms of both sides of the original equation yields:\n$$ (s+1)X(s) - 1 = \\frac{\\exp(-2s)}{s} $$\nNow, we solve for $X(s)$:\n$$ (s+1)X(s) = 1 + \\frac{\\exp(-2s)}{s} $$\n$$ X(s) = \\frac{1}{s+1} + \\frac{\\exp(-2s)}{s(s+1)} $$\nTo find the solution $x(t)$, we must compute the inverse Laplace transform of $X(s)$. We address each term separately.\nThe first term is straightforward:\n$$ \\mathcal{L}^{-1}\\left\\{\\frac{1}{s+1}\\right\\} = \\exp(-t)u(t) $$\nThe term $u(t)$ is included to emphasize that we are finding a causal solution, which is zero for $t0$.\n\nFor the second term, $\\frac{\\exp(-2s)}{s(s+1)}$, we first find the inverse transform of the expression without the exponential factor, $G(s) = \\frac{1}{s(s+1)}$. We use partial fraction decomposition:\n$$ \\frac{1}{s(s+1)} = \\frac{A}{s} + \\frac{B}{s+1} $$\nMultiplying by $s(s+1)$ gives $1 = A(s+1) + Bs$.\nFor $s=0$, we get $1 = A(1)$, so $A=1$.\nFor $s=-1$, we get $1 = B(-1)$, so $B=-1$.\nThus, the partial fraction expansion is:\n$$ G(s) = \\frac{1}{s} - \\frac{1}{s+1} $$\nThe inverse Laplace transform of $G(s)$ is $g(t)$:\n$$ g(t) = \\mathcal{L}^{-1}\\left\\{\\frac{1}{s} - \\frac{1}{s+1}\\right\\} = u(t) - \\exp(-t)u(t) = (1 - \\exp(-t))u(t) $$\nNow, we apply the time-shifting property to find the inverse transform of the complete second term, $\\exp(-2s)G(s)$:\n$$ \\mathcal{L}^{-1}\\{\\exp(-2s)G(s)\\} = g(t-2)u(t-2) $$\nSubstituting the expression for $g(t)$:\n$$ \\mathcal{L}^{-1}\\left\\{\\frac{\\exp(-2s)}{s(s+1)}\\right\\} = (1 - \\exp(-(t-2)))u(t-2) $$\nThe final solution $x(t)$ is the sum of the inverse transforms of the two terms in $X(s)$:\n$$ x(t) = \\mathcal{L}^{-1}\\left\\{\\frac{1}{s+1}\\right\\} + \\mathcal{L}^{-1}\\left\\{\\frac{\\exp(-2s)}{s(s+1)}\\right\\} $$\n$$ x(t) = \\exp(-t)u(t) + (1 - \\exp(-(t-2)))u(t-2) $$\nThis expression represents the unique causal solution $x(t)$ for all real $t$, written as a single closed-form expression as required.\nWe can express this piecewise to verify its behavior.\nFor $t  0$, $u(t)=0$ and $u(t-2)=0$, so $x(t)=0$.\nFor $0 \\le t  2$, $u(t)=1$ and $u(t-2)=0$, so $x(t)=\\exp(-t)$.

The transfer function describes an unstable system, which is a valid scenario for analysis, particularly for examining the applicability of theorems like the FVT. The problem is therefore deemed valid.\n\nThe solution proceeds in two parts as requested.\n\nPart 1: Applicability of the Final Value Theorem (FVT)\n\nThe Final Value Theorem states that if the limit $\\lim_{t \\to \\infty} y(t)$ exists and is finite, then it can be computed in the Laplace domain as $\\lim_{s \\to 0} sY(s)$. A necessary condition for the validity of this theorem is that the function $sY(s)$ must have all its poles in the open left-half of the complex plane. That is, for every pole $p$ of $sY(s)$, it must satisfy $\\text{Re}(p)  0$.\n\nThe output $Y(s)$ of the system is given by the product of the transfer function $G(s)$ and the input transform $U(s)$:\n$$Y(s) = G(s)U(s)$$\nThe input is a unit step function, $u(t)$, defined for $t \\ge 0$. Its unilateral Laplace transform is:\n$$U(s) = \\mathcal{L}\\{u(t)\\} = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} 1 \\cdot \\exp(-st) dt = \\frac{1}{s}$$\nThe system's transfer function is given as:\n$$G(s) = \\frac{2}{(s+1)(s-1)}$$\nThe transform of the output is therefore:\n$$Y(s) = \\left( \\frac{2}{(s+1)(s-1)} \\right) \\left( \\frac{1}{s} \\right) = \\frac{2}{s(s+1)(s-1)}$$\nTo check the applicability of the FVT, we must examine the poles of the function $sY(s)$:\n$$sY(s) = s \\left( \\frac{2}{s(s+1)(s-1)} \\right) = \\frac{2}{(s+1)(s-1)}$$\nThe poles of $sY(s)$ are the roots of the denominator, which are $p_1 = -1$ and $p_2 = 1$.\nThe pole $p_1 = -1$ is in the open left-half plane, which is acceptable. However, the pole $p_2 = 1$ is in the right-half plane, since $\\text{Re}(p_2) = 1  0$. The presence of a pole in the right-half plane violates the necessary condition for the FVT.\nTherefore, the Final Value Theorem does not apply to $y(t)$ for this system and input. Applying it would yield a finite, but incorrect, value of $\\lim_{s \\to 0} sY(s) = \\frac{2}{(0+1)(0-1)} = -2$, which has no correspondence to the actual behavior of $y(t)$.\n\nPart 2: Calculation of the actual limit $\\lim_{t \\to \\infty} y(t)$\n\nTo find the true limit, we must first determine the time-domain output $y(t)$ by computing the inverse Laplace transform of $Y(s)$. We use partial fraction expansion for $Y(s)$:\n$$Y(s) = \\frac{2}{s(s+1)(s-1)} = \\frac{A}{s} + \\frac{B}{s+1} + \\frac{C}{s-1}$$\nThe coefficients $A$, $B$, and $C$ are found using the residue method:\n$$A = \\lim_{s \\to 0} sY(s) = \\lim_{s \\to 0} \\frac{2}{(s+1)(s-1)} = \\frac{2}{(1)(-1)} = -2$$\n$$B = \\lim_{s \\to -1} (s+1)Y(s) = \\lim_{s \\to -1} \\frac{2}{s(s-1)} = \\frac{2}{(-1)(-1-1)} = \\frac{2}{2} = 1$$\n$$C = \\lim_{s \\to 1} (s-1)Y(s) = \\lim_{s \\to 1} \\frac{2}{s(s+1)} = \\frac{2}{(1)(1+1)} = \\frac{2}{2} = 1$$\nSubstituting these coefficients back into the expansion gives:\n$$Y(s) = -\\frac{2}{s} + \\frac{1}{s+1} + \\frac{1}{s-1}$$\nWe now take the inverse Laplace transform of each term to find $y(t)$. For a causal system with zero initial conditions, this is:\n$$y(t) = \\mathcal{L}^{-1}\\{Y(s)\\} = \\mathcal{L}^{-1}\\left\\{-\\frac{2}{s}\\right\\} + \\mathcal{L}^{-1}\\left\\{\\frac{1}{s+1}\\right\\} + \\mathcal{L}^{-1}\\left\\{\\frac{1}{s-1}\\right\\}$$\nUsing standard transform pairs, for $t \\ge 0$:\n$$y(t) = -2(1) + \\exp(-t) + \\exp(t)$$\n$$y(t) = \\exp(t) + \\exp(-t) - 2$$\nThis expression can also be written in terms of the hyperbolic cosine function as $y(t) = 2\\cosh(t) - 2$.\n\nNow we evaluate the limit of $y(t)$ as $t \\to \\infty$:\n$$\\lim_{t \\to \\infty} y(t) = \\lim_{t \\to \\infty} (\\exp(t) + \\exp(-t) - 2)$$\nAs $t \\to \\infty$, the term $\\exp(t)$ grows without bound, i.e., $\\exp(t) \\to \\infty$. The term $\\exp(-t)$ approaches $0$. The constant term remains $-2$.\nThus, the limit is:\n$$\\lim_{t \\to \\infty} y(t) = \\infty + 0 - 2 = \\infty$$\nThe output $y(t)$ diverges to infinity.

The problem is a standard exercise in state-space analysis and does not contain any logical contradictions, factual inaccuracies, or unscientific claims. Therefore, the problem is deemed valid and a solution will be provided.\n\nThe transfer function $G(s)$ of a state-space system is defined by the relation $Y(s) = G(s)U(s)$, where $Y(s)$ and $U(s)$ are the Laplace transforms of the output $y(t)$ and input $u(t)$, respectively. We begin by taking the Laplace transform of the state and output equations, applying the zero initial condition $x(0) = 0$.\nThe state equation transforms to:\n$sX(s) - x(0) = AX(s) + BU(s) \\implies sX(s) = AX(s) + BU(s)$\nThe output equation transforms to:\n$Y(s) = CX(s) + DU(s)$\n\nFrom the transformed state equation, we solve for $X(s)$:\n$sX(s) - AX(s) = BU(s)$\n$(sI - A)X(s) = BU(s)$\n$X(s) = (sI - A)^{-1}BU(s)$\nwhere $I$ is the $2 \\times 2$ identity matrix.\n\nSubstituting this expression for $X(s)$ into the transformed output equation gives:\n$Y(s) = C(sI - A)^{-1}BU(s) + DU(s)$\n$Y(s) = [C(sI - A)^{-1}B + D]U(s)$\nThus, the transfer function $G(s)$ is given by the formula:\n$$G(s) = C(sI - A)^{-1}B + D$$\n\nNow, we substitute the given matrices into this formula. The matrix $D$ is the zero scalar, $D=0$.\nFirst, we compute the term $(sI - A)$:\n$$sI - A = s\\begin{pmatrix}1  0\\\\ 0  1\\end{pmatrix} - \\begin{pmatrix}0  1\\\\ -2  -3\\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix}s  -1\\\\ 2  s+3\\end{pmatrix}$$\nNext, we find the inverse of this matrix, $(sI - A)^{-1}$. The determinant of $(sI - A)$ is:\n$$\\det(sI - A) = s(s+3) - (-1)(2) = s^2 + 3s + 2$$\nThe inverse is then:\n$$(sI - A)^{-1} = \\frac{1}{s^2 + 3s + 2}\\begin{pmatrix}s+3  1\\\\ -2  s\\end{pmatrix}$$\nNow we pre-multiply by $C$ and post-multiply by $B$:\n$$G(s) = \\begin{pmatrix}2  1\\end{pmatrix} \\left( \\frac{1}{s^2 + 3s + 2}\\begin{pmatrix}s+3  1\\\\ -2  s\\end{pmatrix} \\right) \\begin{pmatrix}0\\\\ 1\\end{pmatrix}$$\n$$G(s) = \\frac{1}{s^2 + 3s + 2} \\begin{pmatrix}2  1\\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix}s+3  1\\\\ -2  s\\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix}0\\\\ 1\\end{pmatrix}$$\nFirst, we compute the product $\\begin{pmatrix}2  1\\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix}s+3  1\\\\ -2  s\\end{pmatrix}$:\n$$\\begin{pmatrix}2  1\\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix}s+3  1\\\\ -2  s\\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix}2(s+3) + 1(-2)  2(1) + 1(s)\\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix}2s+6-2  2+s\\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix}2s+4  s+2\\end{pmatrix}$$\nNow, we complete the final multiplication:\n$$G(s) = \\frac{1}{s^2 + 3s + 2} \\begin{pmatrix}2s+4  s+2\\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix}0\\\\ 1\\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{(2s+4)(0) + (s+2)(1)}{s^2 + 3s + 2}$$\nThis simplifies to:\n$$G(s) = \\frac{s+2}{s^2 + 3s + 2}$$\nThis result verifies the expression given in the problem statement.\n\nNext, we analyze the pole-zero cancellation. We factor the denominator of $G(s)$:\n$$s^2 + 3s + 2 = (s+1)(s+2)$$\nSo, the transfer function is:\n$$G(s) = \\frac{s+2}{(s+1)(s+2)}$$\nA common factor of $(s+2)$ appears in the numerator and the denominator. This corresponds to a zero at $s = -2$ and a pole at $s = -2$. This is a pole-zero cancellation. After cancellation, the reduced transfer function is $G_{red}(s) = \\frac{1}{s+1}$. This cancellation implies that the original $2^{nd}$-order state-space realization is not minimal. A non-minimal realization is either not controllable, not observable, or neither.\n\nWe check for controllability using the controllability matrix $\\mathcal{C} = \\begin{pmatrix} B  AB \\end{pmatrix}$. The system is controllable if $\\mathcal{C}$ has full rank, which is $2$ for this system.\n$B = \\begin{pmatrix}0\\\\ 1\\end{pmatrix}$\n$AB = \\begin{pmatrix}0  1\\\\ -2  -3\\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix}0\\\\ 1\\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix}1\\\\ -3\\end{pmatrix}$\nThe controllability matrix is:\n$$\\mathcal{C} = \\begin{pmatrix}0  1\\\\ 1  -3\\end{pmatrix}$$\nThe determinant of $\\mathcal{C}$ is $\\det(\\mathcal{C}) = (0)(-3) - (1)(1) = -1$. Since $\\det(\\mathcal{C}) \\neq 0$, the matrix has rank $2$. The realization is controllable.\n\nWe check for observability using the observability matrix $\\mathcal{O} = \\begin{pmatrix} C \\\\ CA \\end{pmatrix}$. The system is observable if $\\mathcal{O}$ has full rank, which is $2$.\n$C = \\begin{pmatrix}2  1\\end{pmatrix}$\n$CA = \\begin{pmatrix}2  1\\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix}0  1\\\\ -2  -3\\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix}2(0)+1(-2)  2(1)+1(-3)\\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix}-2  -1\\end{pmatrix}$\nThe observability matrix is:\n$$\\mathcal{O} = \\begin{pmatrix}2  1\\\\ -2  -1\\end{pmatrix}$$\nThe determinant of $\\mathcal{O}$ is $\\det(\\mathcal{O}) = (2)(-1) - (1)(-2) = -2 + 2 = 0$. Since $\\det(\\mathcal{O}) = 0$, the matrix does not have full rank; its rank is $1$. The realization is not observable.\n\nThe pole-zero cancellation at $s = -2$ is a direct consequence of the lack of observability. The unobservable mode of the system corresponds to the pole that is cancelled. The poles of the system are the eigenvalues of $A$, which are the roots of $\\det(sI-A)=s^2+3s+2=0$, so the eigenvalues are $\\lambda_1 = -1$ and $\\lambda_2 = -2$. The unobservable subspace is the null space of $\\mathcal{O}$, spanned by the vector $v$ such that $\\mathcal{O}v = 0$. For $v=\\begin{pmatrix}v_1 \\\\ v_2\\end{pmatrix}$, we have $2v_1+v_2 = 0$. An eigenvector of $A$ associated with $\\lambda_2=-2$ is $v = \\begin{pmatrix}1 \\\\ -2\\end{pmatrix}$. This vector satisfies $2(1)+(-2)=0$, so it lies in the null space of $\\mathcal{O}$. This confirms the unobservable mode is associated with the eigenvalue $-2$.\n\nFinally, we determine the McMillan degree of the system. The McMillan degree is the order of a minimal state-space realization of the transfer function $G(s)$. This order is equal to the degree of the denominator of the transfer function after all pole-zero cancellations have been performed.\nAs shown, $G(s) = \\frac{s+2}{(s+1)(s+2)}$ reduces to $G_{red}(s) = \\frac{1}{s+1}$.\nThe denominator of the reduced transfer function is $s+1$, which is a polynomial of degree $1$.\nTherefore, the McMillan degree of the system is $1$.\nAny minimal realization must have an order of $1$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{1}$$", "id": "2717394"}]}
