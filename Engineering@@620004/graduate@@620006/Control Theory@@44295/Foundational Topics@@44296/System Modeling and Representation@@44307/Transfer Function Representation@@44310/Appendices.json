The homogeneous solution is therefore:\n$$\ny_h(t) = C_1 \\exp(-2t) + C_2 \\exp(-3t)\n$$\n\n_Particular Solution:_\nThe input is $u(t) = \\exp(-4t)$. We use the method of undetermined coefficients and assume a particular solution of the form $y_p(t) = A \\exp(-4t)$. Its derivatives are $\\dot{y}_p(t) = -4A\\exp(-4t)$ and $\\ddot{y}_p(t) = 16A\\exp(-4t)$. Substituting into the full ODE:\n$$\n16A\\exp(-4t) + 5(-4A\\exp(-4t)) + 6(A\\exp(-4t)) = \\exp(-4t)\n$$\n$$\n(16 - 20 + 6)A\\exp(-4t) = \\exp(-4t)\n$$\n$$\n2A = 1 \\implies A = \\frac{1}{2}\n$$\nThus, the particular solution is $y_p(t) = \\frac{1}{2}\\exp(-4t)$.\n\n_Total Solution and Initial Conditions:_\nThe general solution is $y(t) = C_1 \\exp(-2t) + C_2 \\exp(-3t) + \\frac{1}{2}\\exp(-4t)$.

Substituting into $(2)$:\n$$\n-2(\\frac{1}{2} - C_2) - 3C_2 = 1 \\implies -1 + 2C_2 - 3C_2 = 1 \\implies -C_2 = 2 \\implies C_2 = -2\n$$\nThen $C_1 = \\frac{1}{2} - (-2) = \\frac{5}{2}$.\nThe final time-domain solution is:\n$$\ny(t) = \\frac{5}{2}\\exp(-2t) - 2\\exp(-3t) + \\frac{1}{2}\\exp(-4t)\n$$\n\n**Method B: Laplace Transform Solution**\nWe again take the Laplace transform of the full ODE, but this time we incorporate the given non-zero initial conditions $y(0)=1$ and $\\dot{y}(0)=-1$.\n$$\n[s^2 Y(s) - s y(0) - \\dot{y}(0)] + 5[s Y(s) - y(0)] + 6 Y(s) = U(s)\n$$\nSubstituting the initial conditions:\n$$\n[s^2 Y(s) - s(1) - (-1)] + 5[s Y(s) - 1] + 6 Y(s) = U(s)\n$$\n$$\n(s^2 + 5s + 6)Y(s) - s + 1 - 5 = U(s)\n$$\n$$\n(s^2 + 5s + 6)Y(s) = U(s) + s + 4\n$$\nThe Laplace transform of the input $u(t) = \\exp(-4t)$ is $U(s) = \\frac{1}{s+4}$.\n$$\n(s+2)(s+3)Y(s) = \\frac{1}{s+4} + s + 4\n$$\nSolving for $Y(s)$:\n$$\nY(s) = \\frac{1}{(s+2)(s+3)(s+4)} + \\frac{s+4}{(s+2)(s+3)}\n$$\nTo perform the inverse transform, we express $Y(s)$ as a single rational function and use partial fraction expansion.\n$$\nY(s) = \\frac{1 + (s+4)^2}{(s+2)(s+3)(s+4)} = \\frac{1 + s^2 + 8s + 16}{(s+2)(s+3)(s+4)} = \\frac{s^2 + 8s + 17}{(s+2)(s+3)(s+4)}\n$$\nWe expand this as $Y(s) = \\frac{A}{s+2} + \\frac{B}{s+3} + \\frac{C}{s+4}$. The coefficients are found using the residue method:\n$$\nA = \\lim_{s\\to-2} (s+2)Y(s) = \\frac{(-2)^2 + 8(-2) + 17}{(-2+3)(-2+4)} = \\frac{4 - 16 + 17}{(1)(2)} = \\frac{5}{2}\n$$\n$$\nB = \\lim_{s\\to-3} (s+3)Y(s) = \\frac{(-3)^2 + 8(-3) + 17}{(-3+2)(-3+4)} = \\frac{9 - 24 + 17}{(-1)(1)} = \\frac{2}{-1} = -2\n$$\n$$\nC = \\lim_{s\\to-4} (s+4)Y(s) = \\frac{(-4)^2 + 8(-4) + 17}{(-4+2)(-4+3)} = \\frac{16 - 32 + 17}{(-2)(-1)} = \\frac{1}{2}\n$$\nSo, the Laplace transform of the output is:\n$$\nY(s) = \\frac{5/2}{s+2} - \\frac{2}{s+3} + \\frac{1/2}{s+4}\n$$\nTaking the inverse Laplace transform gives the solution for $y(t)$:\n$$\ny(t) = \\frac{5}{2}\\exp(-2t) - 2\\exp(-3t) + \\frac{1}{2}\\exp(-4t)\n$$\n\n**Part 3: Verification and Simplification**\nThe expression for $y(t)$ obtained via the time-domain method is:\n$$\ny(t) = \\frac{5}{2}\\exp(-2t) - 2\\exp(-3t) + \\frac{1}{2}\\exp(-4t)\n$$\nThe expression for $y(t)$ obtained via the Laplace transform method is:\n$$\ny(t) = \\frac{5}{2}\\exp(-2t) - 2\\exp(-3t) + \\frac{1}{2}\\exp(-4t)\n$$\nThe two expressions are analytically identical, which verifies the correctness of both derivations.

I will proceed with the solution.\n\nThe fundamental relationship between the input $U(s)$ and the output $Y(s)$ of a Linear Time-Invariant (LTI) system with zero initial conditions in the Laplace domain is given by the transfer function $G(s)$:\n$$\nY(s) = G(s) U(s)\n$$\nThe system's transfer function is given as:\n$$\nG(s) = \\frac{s+2}{s(s+1)(s+3)}\n$$\nThe input is a unit step function $u(t)$, applied at $t=0$, whose Laplace transform is:\n$$\nU(s) = \\mathcal{L}\\{u(t)\\} = \\frac{1}{s}\n$$\nTherefore, the output in the Laplace domain is:\n$$\nY(s) = \\left( \\frac{s+2}{s(s+1)(s+3)} \\right) \\left( \\frac{1}{s} \\right) = \\frac{s+2}{s^2(s+1)(s+3)}\n$$\nTo find the time-domain response $y(t) = \\mathcal{L}^{-1}\\{Y(s)\\}$, we must first perform a partial fraction expansion of $Y(s)$.

A system is defined as BIBO stable if and only if every bounded input produces a bounded output. For an LTI system, a necessary and sufficient condition for BIBO stability is that its impulse response $g(t)$ is absolutely integrable, i.e., $\\int_{0}^{\\infty} |g(t)| dt < \\infty$. This condition, in the Laplace domain, is equivalent to all poles of the transfer function $G(s)$ having strictly negative real parts (i.e., they must lie in the open left-half of the complex s-plane).\n\nThe transfer function of the given system is $G(s) = \\frac{s+2}{s(s+1)(s+3)}$. The poles are the roots of the denominator, which are $s_1=0$, $s_2=-1$, and $s_3=-3$. The pole at $s_1=0$ does not have a strictly negative real part; it lies on the imaginary axis. Therefore, the system is not BIBO stable. This type of pole is an ideal integrator.\n\nTo see this from the definition of the impulse response, we first find $g(t) = \\mathcal{L}^{-1}\\{G(s)\\}$. The partial fraction expansion of $G(s)$ is:\n$$\nG(s) = \\frac{K_1}{s} + \\frac{K_2}{s+1} + \\frac{K_3}{s+3}\n$$\nwhere\n$K_1 = [sG(s)]_{s=0} = \\frac{2}{3}$,\n$K_2 = [(s+1)G(s)]_{s=-1} = \\frac{1}{(-1)(2)} = -\\frac{1}{2}$,\n$K_3 = [(s+3)G(s)]_{s=-3} = \\frac{-1}{(-3)(-2)} = -\\frac{1}{6}$.\nThe impulse response for $t \\ge 0$ is:\n$$\ng(t) = \\frac{2}{3} - \\frac{1}{2}\\exp(-t) - \\frac{1}{6}\\exp(-3t)\n$$\nThe absolute integrability condition is violated because as $t \\to \\infty$, $g(t)$ approaches a constant value of $\\frac{2}{3}$. The integral $\\int_{0}^{\\infty} |g(t)| dt$ diverges, confirming the system is not BIBO stable.\n\nThe failure of BIBO stability is evident in the step response $y(t)$ we derived:\n$$\ny(t) = \\frac{2}{3}t - \\frac{5}{9} + \\frac{1}{2}\\exp(-t) + \\frac{1}{18}\\exp(-3t)\n$$\nThe input $u(t)$ is bounded, as $|u(t)|=1$ for $t \\ge 0$. However, the output $y(t)$ is unbounded. As $t \\to \\infty$, the exponential terms decay to zero, but the term $\\frac{2}{3}t$ grows linearly without bound. This term is precisely what causes the output to be unbounded.\n\nThis unbounded behavior occurs because the system contains an integrator (the pole at $s=0$), and the input contains a non-zero direct-current (DC) component. The step input has a DC value of $1$. The integrator in the system, represented by the term $\\frac{K_1}{s} = \\frac{2/3}{s}$ in the expansion of $G(s)$, integrates this DC component of the input. In the Laplace domain, the interaction between the integrator and the step input (DC component) manifests as a product of terms $\\frac{1}{s} \\cdot \\frac{1}{s} = \\frac{1}{s^2}$. The inverse Laplace transform of this is a ramp function, $t$. The term $\\frac{2}{3}t$ in the output is the direct result of the system's integrator with gain $\\frac{2}{3}$ acting on the unit step input. Any bounded input with a non-zero DC component will similarly cause a ramp-like, unbounded output from an ideal integrator, thus violating BIBO stability.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{y(t) = \\frac{2}{3}t - \\frac{5}{9} + \\frac{1}{2}\\exp(-t) + \\frac{1}{18}\\exp(-3t)}\n$$", "id": "2755941"}, {"introduction": "Real-world control systems are rarely monolithic; they are typically complex interconnections of smaller subsystems.
