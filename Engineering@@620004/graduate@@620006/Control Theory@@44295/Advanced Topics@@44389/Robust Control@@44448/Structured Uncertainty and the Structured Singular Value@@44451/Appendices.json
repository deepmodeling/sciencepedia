To minimize $\\|\\Delta\\| = \\max\\{|1/m_{1}|, |\\delta_{2}|\\}$, we must choose $\\delta_{2}$ to have the smallest possible modulus, which is $|\\delta_{2}|=0$. Thus, we can choose $\\delta_{2}=0$.

Determination of the Small Gain Bound $\\rho_{\\mathrm{sg}}$\n\nThe classical small gain theorem provides a sufficient condition for robust stability. It states that the interconnection of $M$ and $\\Delta$ is stable if the loop gain is less than one. When applied without considering the specific structure of $\\Delta$ (i.e., treating it as a generic perturbation), the condition is $\\|M\\|_2 \\|\\Delta\\|_2 < 1$. Robust stability is thus guaranteed for all perturbations $\\Delta$ such that $\\|\\Delta\\|_2 < \\frac{1}{\\|M\\|_2}$. The definition of the block norm, $\\|\\Delta\\| = \\max\\{|\\delta_{1}|,\\,|\\delta_{2}|\\}$, is identical to the induced $2$-norm for a diagonal matrix, i.e., $\\|\\Delta\\|_2 = \\max_{i} |\\delta_{i}| = \\|\\Delta\\|$.\n\nTherefore, the largest uncertainty radius that can be certified by the small gain theorem is $\\rho_{\\mathrm{sg}} = \\frac{1}{\\|M\\|_2}$. The induced $2$-norm of a matrix is its largest singular value, $\\sigma_{\\max}(M)$. We compute this value.\n\nThe singular values of $M$ are the square roots of the eigenvalues of $M^{*}M$, where $M^{*}$ is the conjugate transpose of $M$. Since $M$ is a real matrix, $M^{*} = M^{T}$.\n$$\nM^{*}M = \\begin{bmatrix} 0 & \\frac{1}{2} \\\\ 4 & 0 \\end{bmatrix} \\begin{bmatrix} 0 & 4 \\\\ \\frac{1}{2} & 0 \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^2 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 4^2 \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} \\frac{1}{4} & 0 \\\\ 0 & 16 \\end{bmatrix}\n$$\nThe eigenvalues of this diagonal matrix are $\\lambda_{1} = \\frac{1}{4}$ and $\\lambda_{2} = 16$. The largest eigenvalue is $\\lambda_{\\max}(M^{*}M) = 16$.\nThe largest singular value of $M$ is thus:\n$$\n\\sigma_{\\max}(M) = \\sqrt{\\lambda_{\\max}(M^{*}M)} = \\sqrt{16} = 4\n$$\nSo, $\\|M\\|_2 = 4$.

Computation of the Exact Structured Singular Value $\\mu(M)$\n\nThe structured singular value, $\\mu(M)$, is defined as the reciprocal of the smallest radius $\\rho > 0$ for which there exists a destabilizing perturbation $\\Delta$ with $\\|\\Delta\\| \\le \\rho$. A destabilizing perturbation is one that makes the system singular, i.e., $\\det(I - M\\Delta) = 0$.\n\nWe must solve this equation for the given structure of $M$ and $\\Delta$.\n$$\nM\\Delta = \\begin{bmatrix} 0 & 4 \\\\ \\frac{1}{2} & 0 \\end{bmatrix} \\begin{bmatrix} \\delta_{1} & 0 \\\\ 0 & \\delta_{2} \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} 0 & 4\\delta_{2} \\\\ \\frac{1}{2}\\delta_{1} & 0 \\end{bmatrix}\n$$\n$$\nI - M\\Delta = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{bmatrix} - \\begin{bmatrix} 0 & 4\\delta_{2} \\\\ \\frac{1}{2}\\delta_{1} & 0 \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & -4\\delta_{2} \\\\ -\\frac{1}{2}\\delta_{1} & 1 \\end{bmatrix}\n$$\nThe condition for singularity is:\n$$\n\\det(I - M\\Delta) = (1)(1) - (-4\\delta_{2})\\left(-\\frac{1}{2}\\delta_{1}\\right) = 1 - 2\\delta_{1}\\delta_{2} = 0\n$$\nThis gives the simple relation $\\delta_{1}\\delta_{2} = \\frac{1}{2}$.\n\nWe seek the smallest $\\rho$ such that there exist complex numbers $\\delta_{1}, \\delta_{2}$ satisfying both $\\delta_{1}\\delta_{2} = \\frac{1}{2}$ and $\\|\\Delta\\| = \\max\\{|\\delta_{1}|, |\\delta_{2}|\\} = \\rho$. Let $r_{1} = |\\delta_{1}|$ and $r_{2} = |\\delta_{2}|$. The conditions become:\n1. $r_{1}r_{2} = \\left|\\frac{1}{2}\\right| = \\frac{1}{2}$\n2. $\\max\\{r_{1}, r_{2}\\} = \\rho$\n\nWe wish to minimize $\\rho$. Let us assume, without loss of generality, that $r_{1} \\le r_{2}$. Then $\\rho = r_{2}$. We want to minimize $r_{2}$ subject to $r_{1} = \\frac{1}{2r_{2}}$ and the constraint $r_{1} \\le r_{2}$. Substituting $r_{1}$ gives:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{2r_{2}} \\le r_{2} \\implies 1 \\le 2r_{2}^{2} \\implies r_{2}^{2} \\ge \\frac{1}{2} \\implies r_{2} \\ge \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\n$$\nThe minimum possible value for $r_{2}$ (and thus for $\\rho$) is $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}$. This minimum is attained when $r_{1} = r_{2}$, which gives $r_{1} = r_{2} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}$.\nThe smallest radius $\\rho$ for which a destabilizing perturbation exists is therefore $\\rho_{\\mu} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}$.\n\nThe structured singular value is the reciprocal of this radius:\n$$\n\\mu(M) = \\frac{1}{\\rho_{\\mu}} = \\frac{1}{1/\\sqrt{2}} = \\sqrt{2}\n$$\n\n3. Explanation of Conservatism\n\nThe exact robustness margin is $\\rho_{\\mu} = \\frac{1}{\\mu(M)} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}$. The bound from the small gain theorem is $\\rho_{\\mathrm{sg}} = \\frac{1}{4}$. We compare these values:\n$$\n\\rho_{\\mathrm{sg}} = \\frac{1}{4} = 0.25 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\rho_{\\mu} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\approx 0.707\n$$\nClearly, $\\rho_{\\mathrm{sg}} < \\rho_{\\mu}$. This demonstrates that the small gain theorem provides a conservative estimate of the true robustness margin.\n\nThe reason for this conservatism is fundamental. The small gain theorem bound, $\\rho_{\\mathrm{sg}} = 1/\\sigma_{\\max}(M)$, is derived by considering the worst-case amplification of the matrix $M$. This worst case corresponds to a perturbation $\\Delta$ that is a rank-one matrix aligned with the principal singular vectors of $M$. For our matrix $M$, this worst-case unstructured perturbation is proportional to $\\begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 0 & 0 \\end{bmatrix}$, which is not of the diagonal form $\\operatorname{diag}(\\delta_{1}, \\delta_{2})$ required by the problem. The small gain theorem therefore bases its stability guarantee on a class of perturbations that are not permitted by the specified uncertainty structure.\n\nThe structured singular value $\\mu(M)$, by contrast, explicitly accounts for the prescribed block-diagonal structure of $\\Delta$. It finds the smallest perturbation *within the allowed structural set* that can cause instability. By restricting the search space for destabilizing perturbations, the $\\mu$-analysis provides a much less conservative, and in this case exact, measure of robustness. The small gain condition is sufficient, but not necessary, for stability against structured perturbations.

The minimum value of $\\max\\{1, |\\delta_{2}|\\}$ is achieved for any $\\delta_{2}$ with $|\\delta_{2}| \\le 1$. This minimum value is $1$. For instance, choosing $\\delta_{2} = 0$ gives $\\Delta = \\operatorname{diag}(1, 0)$ with $\\|\\Delta\\|=1$.\nSo, the minimum norm of a destabilizing perturbation is $1$.\nFrom the definition of $\\mu$, we have:\n$$\n\\mu_{\\Delta}(M_{1}M_{2}) = \\frac{1}{1} = 1\n$$\nTo demonstrate the failure of submultiplicativity, we compare $\\mu_{\\Delta}(M_{1}M_{2})$ with the product $\\mu_{\\Delta}(M_{1})\\mu_{\\Delta}(M_{2})$.\nWe have calculated $\\mu_{\\Delta}(M_{1}) = 0$ and $\\mu_{\\Delta}(M_{2}) = 0$. Their product is $\\mu_{\\Delta}(M_{1})\\mu_{\\Delta}(M_{2}) = 0 \\times 0 = 0$.\nThe submultiplicative property would require $\\mu_{\\Delta}(M_{1}M_{2}) \\le \\mu_{\\Delta}(M_{1})\\mu_{\\Delta}(M_{2})$.\nHowever, we find $1 \\le 0$, which is a contradiction. This demonstrates that the structured singular value $\\mu_{\\Delta}$ is not, in general, a submultiplicative function of its matrix argument.\n\nThe problem asks for the value of $\\mu_{\\Delta}(M_{1} M_{2})$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{1}$$", "id": "2750576"}]}
