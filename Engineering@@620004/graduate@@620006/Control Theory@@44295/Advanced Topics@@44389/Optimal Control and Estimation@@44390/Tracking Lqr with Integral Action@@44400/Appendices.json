The optimal control law is of the form $u(t) = -K x_a(t)$.\nThe gain matrix $K$ is given by $K = R^{-1} B_a^{\\top} P$, where $P$ is the unique, symmetric, positive-semidefinite solution to the Continuous-time Algebraic Riccati Equation (CARE):\n$$\nA_a^{\\top} P + P A_a - P B_a R^{-1} B_a^{\\top} P + Q = 0\n$$\nExistence and uniqueness of a stabilizing solution $P$ are guaranteed if the pair $(A_a, B_a)$ is stabilizable and the pair $(A_a, Q^{1/2})$ is detectable. The controllability matrix for the augmented system is:\n$$\n\\mathcal{C} = \\begin{pmatrix} B_a & A_a B_a & A_a^2 B_a \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 & -0.6 \\\\ 1 & -0.6 & -1.64 \\\\ 0 & 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe determinant is $\\det(\\mathcal{C}) = 1 \\neq 0$, so the system is controllable, which implies it is stabilizable. Since $Q = \\mathrm{diag}(1, 0.2, 8)$ is positive definite, the pair $(A_a, Q^{1/2})$ is observable, which implies it is detectable. Thus, a unique stabilizing solution $P \\succ 0$ exists.\n\nLet $P$ be a symmetric $3 \\times 3$ matrix:\n$$\nP = \\begin{pmatrix} p_{11} & p_{12} & p_{13} \\\\ p_{12} & p_{22} & p_{23} \\\\ p_{13} & p_{23} & p_{33} \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe CARE expands into a system of six coupled nonlinear algebraic equations for the elements of $P$. The problem asks for numerical computation of $P$ and $K$. Using a numerical solver (such as MATLAB or SciPy), one would solve the CARE with the derived $A_a$ and other given matrices. For instance, the original text provided numerical values for P that were found to be inconsistent with the CARE itself:\n$$\nP \\approx \\begin{pmatrix} 7.1231 & 1.9000 & 3.6569 \\\\ 1.9000 & 2.0000 & 2.8284 \\\\ 3.6569 & 2.8284 & 8.0000 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe optimal gain would be $K = R^{-1} B_a^{\\top} P = [p_{12}, p_{22}, p_{23}]$:\n$$\nK \\approx \\begin{pmatrix} 1.9000 & 2.0000 & 2.8284 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nAs the original solution noted, these numbers are inconsistent with the CARE even for the original incorrect formulation. The primary question about tracking error, however, can be answered from first principles without relying on specific numerical values of $P$ and $K$.\n\nThe closed-loop system dynamics are given by:\n$$\n\\dot{x}_a(t) = (A_a - B_a K) x_a(t) + E r(t)\n$$\nThe LQR design guarantees that the gain $K$ stabilizes the system, meaning the closed-loop matrix $A_{cl} = A_a - B_a K$ is Hurwitz (all its eigenvalues have negative real parts).\nFor a constant reference input $r(t) = r$, a stable linear system will converge to a unique steady state $x_{a,ss}$ where $\\dot{x}_a(t) \\to 0$.\nAt steady state, the derivatives of the state variables are zero.\n$$\n\\lim_{t \\to \\infty} \\dot{x}_a(t) = 0\n$$\nThis implies that each component of the state vector derivative is zero.

Therefore, at steady state:\n$$\n\\lim_{t \\to \\infty} (r - y(t)) = 0\n$$\nThis leads to the conclusion that the steady-state output $y_{ss}$ must be equal to the reference $r$:\n$$\ny_{ss} = \\lim_{t \\to \\infty} y(t) = r\n$$\nThe steady-state tracking error is defined as $e_{\\infty} = \\lim_{t \\to \\infty} (r(t) - y(t))$.\nSubstituting the steady-state values for $r(t)=r$ (a constant) and $y(t) \\to y_{ss}$:\n$$\ne_{\\infty} = r - y_{ss} = r - r = 0\n$$\nThis result is a direct consequence of including an integrator in the feedback loop for a stable closed-loop system. The integrator forces the quantity it integrates (the tracking error) to zero in steady state.

All assumptions are standard for the analysis of LQI (Linear Quadratic Integral) controllers. The problem is valid. We proceed to the solution.\n\nThe core of the problem lies in analyzing the system's behavior at steady state. The problem statement provides the crucial assumption that the closed-loop augmented system is asymptotically stable. For a linear time-invariant (LTI) system, asymptotic stability implies that when subjected to constant external inputs (in this case, the reference $r$ and the disturbance $d$), the system state will converge to a unique, constant equilibrium point. Let us denote the augmented state vector as $\\xi(t) = \\begin{bmatrix} x(t) \\\\ z(t) \\end{bmatrix}$. Convergence to a steady state, $\\xi_{\\mathrm{ss}} = \\begin{bmatrix} x_{\\mathrm{ss}} \\\\ z_{\\mathrm{ss}} \\end{bmatrix}$, means that all time derivatives of the state variables approach zero as time approaches infinity.\n$$ \\lim_{t\\to\\infty} \\dot{\\xi}(t) = \\begin{bmatrix} \\lim_{t\\to\\infty} \\dot{x}(t) \\\\ \\lim_{t\\to\\infty} \\dot{z}(t) \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} 0 \\\\ 0 \\end{bmatrix} $$\nWe focus on the dynamics of the integrator state, $z(t)$, which is given by:\n$$ \\dot{z}(t) = r - y(t) $$\nTaking the limit as $t \\to \\infty$ on both sides of this equation, we get:\n$$ \\lim_{t\\to\\infty} \\dot{z}(t) = \\lim_{t\\to\\infty} (r - y(t)) $$\nSince $r$ is a constant vector, and the system converges to a steady state where $y(t) \\to y_{\\mathrm{ss}}$, the equation becomes:\n$$ \\lim_{t\\to\\infty} \\dot{z}(t) = r - \\lim_{t\\to\\infty} y(t) = r - y_{\\mathrm{ss}} $$\nFrom the condition of steady state, we know that $\\lim_{t\\to\\infty} \\dot{z}(t) = 0$. Therefore, we must have:\n$$ 0 = r - y_{\\mathrm{ss}} $$\nThe steady-state tracking error is defined as $e_{\\mathrm{ss}} = \\lim_{t\\to\\infty} (r - y(t))$, which is equal to $r - y_{\\mathrm{ss}}$. By substituting the result from the integrator's equilibrium condition, we arrive at the expression for the steady-state error:\n$$ e_{\\mathrm{ss}} = r - y_{\\mathrm{ss}} = 0 $$\nThis result demonstrates a fundamental principle of control theory: the inclusion of an integrator in the feedback loop for the tracking error ensures that, for a stable closed-loop system, the steady-state error for constant reference signals and constant disturbances is driven to zero. The integrator's state, $z(t)$, accumulates the error over time. For the system to reach an equilibrium where $z(t)$ becomes constant, its derivative, $\\dot{z}(t)$, must be zero. Since $\\dot{z}(t)$ is the tracking error, the error itself must become zero.\n\nIt is necessary to clarify the role of the other assumptions. The problem asks for the condition under which the error is zero. The derivation above shows the error is zero provided a stable steady state is reached. The other assumptions ensure that this is not a vacuous scenario.\nThe condition that the Rosenbrock system matrix $R_{0}=\\begin{bmatrix}A & B \\\\ C & 0\\end{bmatrix}$ is nonsingular (which requires $m=p$ for the matrix to be square) is the precise condition for the existence of a unique steady-state pair $(x_{\\mathrm{ss}}, u_{\\mathrm{ss}})$ that solves the algebraic regulator equations:\n$$ A x_{\\mathrm{ss}} + B u_{\\mathrm{ss}} + E d = 0 $$\n$$ C x_{\\mathrm{ss}} = r $$\nThis can be written as $R_0 \\begin{bmatrix} x_{\\mathrm{ss}} \\\\ u_{\\mathrm{ss}} \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} -Ed \\\\ r \\end{bmatrix}$. The nonsingularity of $R_0$ guarantees that this target equilibrium, which achieves $y_{\\mathrm{ss}} = r$, exists for any $r$ and $d$. Furthermore, this condition is also necessary for the stabilizability of the augmented system, meaning it is possible to find gains $K$ and $K_i$ that render the closed-loop system asymptotically stable.\n\nThe problem's assumption that the system *is* asymptotically stable means that such a stabilizing controller has been successfully designed and implemented, and it will indeed guide the system states to converge to this unique equilibrium where the output matches the reference.\nThus, the expression for the steady-state error $e_{\\mathrm{ss}}$ is identically zero. The condition under which this result holds is the collection of premises stated in the problem: the closed-loop system must be asymptotically stable and subjected to constant reference and disturbance inputs, and the underlying plant must satisfy the structural requirement that its Rosenbrock matrix at zero is nonsingular. The expression itself does not depend on the specific values of $A, B, C, E, d$, or $r$, but its validity does.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0}$$", "id": "2755047"}, {"introduction": "An expert designer knows not only the strengths of a tool but also its limitations.

This fundamental property, along with others, allows us to evaluate the options.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. Regardless of the choice of $Q$ and $\\rho$, as $q_i$ is increased to strengthen integral action and reduce low-frequency sensitivity, the Bode sensitivity integral constraint for plants with RHP zeros forces an increase in sensitivity peaking at higher frequencies. In the time domain, this manifests as more pronounced non-minimum-phase transients (e.g., undershoot or overshoot), with severity that grows as $q_i$ is increased.**\n\nThis statement addresses the \"waterbed effect\" described by the Bode sensitivity integral. For any internally stabilizing LTI controller, the sensitivity function $S(s) = (1+L(s))^{-1}$, where $L(s)$ is the open-loop transfer function, must satisfy certain constraints. For a system with a single RHP zero at $s=z$ and no RHP poles in $L(s)$, the constraint is:\n$$\n\\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\ln |S(j\\omega)| \\, d\\omega = \\pi z\n$$\nSince $z > 0$, the integral is positive. This means that any reduction in sensitivity (i.e., $|S(j\\omega)| < 1$, so $\\ln|S(j\\omega)| < 0$) at some frequencies must be compensated by an increase in sensitivity (i.e., $|S(j\\omega)| > 1$, so $\\ln|S(j\\omega)| > 0$) at other frequencies.\n\nIncreasing the weight $q_i$ on the integral state in the LQR cost penalizes the tracking error integral. The optimizer responds by increasing the integral gain $k_i$, strengthening the integral action. This increases the loop gain $L(s)$ at low frequencies, pushing $|S(j\\omega)|$ closer to $0$ over a wider low-frequency range. To maintain the constant positive value of the Bode integral, this larger \"dip\" in the sensitivity plot must be paid for by a larger \"hump\" where $|S(j\\omega)| > 1$. This is the increase in sensitivity peaking, typically at mid-to-high frequencies.\nA large peak in the sensitivity function is well-known to correlate with poor transient response, such as large overshoot and ringing. For a non-minimum-phase system, this exacerbates the inherent undershoot. Thus, strengthening integral action via $q_i$ makes the non-minimum-phase transient behavior more severe. The statement is a correct description of this fundamental trade-off.\n\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. With sufficiently large $q_i$, the integral action can effectively cancel the plant’s RHP zero and deliver monotone, arbitrarily fast step tracking without overshoot or undershoot.**\n\nThis statement is factually incorrect on multiple counts.\n1.  **Cancellation of RHP Zero**: A controller cannot cancel a plant's RHP zero without causing internal instability. A cancellation would require the controller to have a pole at $s=z$. This would create an unstable mode $e^{zt}$ in the closed loop that is either not controllable from the input or not observable from the output (or both), and thus it cannot be stabilized. The LQR design with integral action results in a static state-feedback controller for the augmented system; it does not place poles to cancel zeros.\n2.  **Invariance of Zeros**: As established, the closed-loop transfer function $T_{yr}(s)$ inherits the plant's RHP zero at $s=z$.\n3.  **Performance Limitations**: A system with a RHP zero cannot have a response that is both arbitrarily fast and arbitrarily well-behaved (e.g., monotone). The presence of the RHP zero at $s=z$ imposes a fundamental limit on performance, precluding monotone, arbitrarily fast tracking. Undershoot is an unavoidable consequence of fast tracking for such systems.\n\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. For any internally stabilizing controller, the plant RHP zero at $+z$ cannot be canceled by a controller pole without loss of internal stability; moreover, static state feedback (including LQR with integral augmentation) does not change the plant’s transmission zeros.**\n\nThis statement comprises two separate, but related, fundamental principles of control theory.\n1.  **Pole-Zero Cancellation**: The first part of the statement, regarding the impossibility of stable cancellation of RHP zeros, is a canonical result. If a controller $K(s)$ has a pole at $s=z$ that cancels the plant zero at $s=z$, where $\\text{Re}(z) > 0$, the resulting closed-loop system will be internally unstable. The unstable mode associated with this pole-zero pair is not stabilized by the feedback loop. This is correct.\n2.  **Invariance of Zeros under State Feedback**: The second part is also a standard result. The transmission zeros of a linear system described by $(A, B, C, D)$ are invariant under static state feedback $u \\to u - Kx$. This is because the transformation does not alter the rank properties of the Rosenbrock system matrix that define the zeros. The LQI controller, being a form of static state feedback on the augmented state vector, falls under this rule. The plant's transmission zeros are preserved in the loop and ultimately appear in the closed-loop transfer function. This is correct.\nBoth parts of the statement are accurate and fundamental to the analysis of the given problem.\n\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**D. There exists a fundamental lower bound on the achievable rise time for monotone step tracking that scales on the order of $1/z$. Attempting to achieve rise times $t_r \\ll 1/z$ necessarily induces pronounced inverse response (undershoot) and/or large control peaks, independently of how $Q$, $q_i$, and $\\rho$ are chosen in the LQR design.**\n\nThis statement describes the time-domain performance limitations imposed by the RHP zero. Since the closed-loop transfer function for the step response is $Y(s) = T_{yr}(s)/s$ and $T_{yr}(z)=0$, we can write a moment constraint on the derivative of the step response $y(t)$:\n$$\n\\mathcal{L}\\{\\dot{y}(t)\\} = sY(s) - y(0) = T_{yr}(s)\n$$\nAssuming $y(0)=0$ and evaluating at $s=z$:\n$$\n\\int_0^{\\infty} \\dot{y}(t) e^{-zt} \\, dt = T_{yr}(z) = 0\n$$\nThis integral equation reveals the core trade-off. For a fast rise time, $\\dot{y}(t)$ must be large and positive for small $t$. Since the weighting term $e^{-zt}$ is largest for small $t$, this creates a large positive contribution to the integral. To satisfy the constraint that the total integral must be zero, $\\dot{y}(t)$ must necessarily take on negative values. A negative $\\dot{y}(t)$ signifies that the output is decreasing, which for a step response that starts at $0$ and goes to $1$, implies an initial undershoot (inverse response). The faster the rise time (larger positive $\\dot{y}(t)$), the more pronounced the undershoot must be to balance the integral.\n\nThis implies a fundamental lower bound on achievable rise time for a given level of acceptable undershoot. A common rule of thumb is that the achievable closed-loop bandwidth $\\omega_B$ is limited by the RHP zero location, e.g., $\\omega_B \\lesssim z$. Since rise time $t_r$ is inversely proportional to bandwidth ($t_r \\approx \\text{const}/\\omega_B$), this leads to a lower bound on rise time, $t_r \\gtrsim 1/z$.\n\nAttempting to violate this bound by aggressive controller tuning (e.g., large $Q$ and $q_i$ relative to $\\rho$) will not remove the limitation but will instead lead to pathological behavior: severe undershoot and/or extremely large control signals ($u(t)$). This limitation is fundamental to the plant itself, independent of the controller design methodology (LQR or otherwise).\n\n**Verdict: Correct.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{ACD}$$", "id": "2755087"}]}
