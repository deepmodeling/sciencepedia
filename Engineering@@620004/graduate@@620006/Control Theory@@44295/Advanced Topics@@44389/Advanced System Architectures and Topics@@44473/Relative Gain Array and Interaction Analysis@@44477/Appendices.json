We begin with a critical validation of the problem statement.\n\nFirst, we extract the givens verbatim:\n1.  The system is a steady-state linear Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) plant.\n2.  The plant gain matrix is a constant $G \\in \\mathbb{R}^{2 \\times 2}$ given by $G = \\begin{bmatrix} 2 & -1 \\\\ 3 & 4 \\end{bmatrix}$.\n3.  The Relative Gain Array (RGA), $\\Lambda$, is defined as being \"constructed from the plant’s steady-state gain matrix and its inverse through elementwise products\". This phrasing, in the context of control theory, unambiguously refers to the Hadamard product of the gain matrix $G$ and the transpose of its inverse, $(G^{-1})^T$.\n4.  The tasks are to compute $\\Lambda$, interpret its entries for control loop pairing, and report the value of the entry $\\lambda_{12}$.\n\nNext, we validate the problem's integrity.\nThe problem is **scientifically grounded** as the RGA is a fundamental and widely used tool in chemical process control and other engineering disciplines for interaction analysis. The problem is **well-posed**: the given matrix $G$ is a non-singular square matrix, which guarantees the existence of a unique inverse and thus a unique RGA matrix. The determinant is $\\det(G) = (2)(4) - (-1)(3) = 8 + 3 = 11 \\neq 0$. The tasks are clear and lead to a unique solution. The language is **objective** and free from ambiguity or subjective claims. The problem is complete and internally consistent.\n\nThe verdict is that the problem is **valid**. We may proceed with the solution.\n\nThe problem requires the computation of the Relative Gain Array (RGA) matrix, denoted $\\Lambda$, for the given steady-state gain matrix $G$. The definition of the RGA is:\n$$\n\\Lambda(G) = G \\circ (G^{-1})^T\n$$\nwhere $\\circ$ represents the elementwise product, or Hadamard product.\n\nFirst, we must compute the inverse of the matrix $G$. For a general $2 \\times 2$ matrix $A = \\begin{bmatrix} a & b \\\\ c & d \\end{bmatrix}$, its inverse is given by the formula:\n$$\nA^{-1} = \\frac{1}{\\det(A)} \\begin{bmatrix} d & -b \\\\ -c & a \\end{bmatrix}\n$$\nFor our given matrix $G = \\begin{bmatrix} 2 & -1 \\\\ 3 & 4 \\end{bmatrix}$, the determinant is:\n$$\n\\det(G) = (2)(4) - (-1)(3) = 8 + 3 = 11\n$$\nSince the determinant is non-zero, the inverse exists. Applying the formula:\n$$\nG^{-1} = \\frac{1}{11} \\begin{bmatrix} 4 & -(-1) \\\\ -3 & 2 \\end{bmatrix} = \\frac{1}{11} \\begin{bmatrix} 4 & 1 \\\\ -3 & 2 \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} \\frac{4}{11} & \\frac{1}{11} \\\\ -\\frac{3}{11} & \\frac{2}{11} \\end{bmatrix}\n$$\nNext, we compute the transpose of this inverse matrix, $(G^{-1})^T$:\n$$\n(G^{-1})^T = \\begin{bmatrix} \\frac{4}{11} & -\\frac{3}{11} \\\\ \\frac{1}{11} & \\frac{2}{11} \\end{bmatrix}\n$$\nNow, we can compute the RGA matrix $\\Lambda$ using the Hadamard product:\n$$\n\\Lambda = G \\circ (G^{-1})^T = \\begin{bmatrix} 2 & -1 \\\\ 3 & 4 \\end{bmatrix} \\circ \\begin{bmatrix} \\frac{4}{11} & -\\frac{3}{11} \\\\ \\frac{1}{11} & \\frac{2}{11} \\end{bmatrix}\n$$\nPerforming the elementwise multiplication:\n$$\n\\Lambda = \\begin{bmatrix} 2 \\cdot \\frac{4}{11} & (-1) \\cdot (-\\frac{3}{11}) \\\\ 3 \\cdot \\frac{1}{11} & 4 \\cdot \\frac{2}{11} \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} \\frac{8}{11} & \\frac{3}{11} \\\\ \\frac{3}{11} & \\frac{8}{11} \\end{bmatrix}\n$$\nThis completes the first part of the task. As requested, we verify a fundamental structural identity of the RGA: that the sum of the elements in each row and each column must equal $1$.\nFor Row 1: $\\frac{8}{11} + \\frac{3}{11} = \\frac{11}{11} = 1$.\nFor Row 2: $\\frac{3}{11} + \\frac{8}{11} = \\frac{11}{11} = 1$.\nFor Column 1: $\\frac{8}{11} + \\frac{3}{11} = \\frac{11}{11} = 1$.\nFor Column 2: $\\frac{3}{11} + \\frac{8}{11} = \\frac{11}{11} = 1$.\nThis property is satisfied, which serves as a necessary check on our calculation.\n\nThe second part of the task is the interpretation of $\\Lambda$. The element $\\lambda_{ij}$ represents the ratio of the open-loop gain between input $u_j$ and output $y_i$ to the closed-loop gain for the same pair when all other loops are under perfect control.\n$$\n\\lambda_{ij} = \\frac{(\\partial y_i / \\partial u_j)_{u_k=\\text{const}, k \\neq j}}{(\\partial y_i / \\partial u_j)_{y_k=\\text{const}, k \\neq i}}\n$$\nThe interpretation rules are as follows:\n- **Pairing Recommendation**: Inputs and outputs should be paired to control loops such that the corresponding diagonal elements of the reordered $\\Lambda$ matrix are positive and as close to $1$ as possible.\n- **$\\lambda_{ij} > 0$**: The sign of the gain from $u_j$ to $y_i$ is the same in open-loop and closed-loop configurations. A positive value is a prerequisite for a stable pairing. A negative value ($\\lambda_{ij} < 0$) indicates that closing other loops will reverse the sign of the process gain, which can cause severe instability. The controller would fight the process.\n- **$\\lambda_{ij} \\approx 1$**: Low interaction from other loops on the $y_i$-$u_j$ pair. This is the most desirable case for pairing.\n- **$\\lambda_{ij} \\approx 0$**: Strong interaction. Closing other loops nearly eliminates the effect of $u_j$ on $y_i$. This pairing is highly undesirable.\n- **$\\lambda_{ij} = 0.5$**: Marks a high degree of interaction. For a $2 \\times 2$ system, if one diagonal element is $0.5$, all are $0.5$.\n- **$\\lambda_{ij} > 1$**: Indicates that closing other loops amplifies the effect of $u_j$ on $y_i$. Interaction is present, but often manageable.\n\nFor our computed RGA matrix $\\Lambda = \\begin{bmatrix} 8/11 & 3/11 \\\\ 3/11 & 8/11 \\end{bmatrix}$:\nAll entries are positive, which means no control loop will experience a sign change in its effective gain due to the action of other loops. This is a favorable condition.\nWe consider two possible pairing strategies:\n1.  Diagonal pairing: ($y_1-u_1$, $y_2-u_2$). The corresponding RGA elements are $\\lambda_{11} = 8/11$ and $\\lambda_{22} = 8/11$.\n2.  Off-diagonal pairing: ($y_1-u_2$, $y_2-u_1$). The corresponding RGA elements are $\\lambda_{12} = 3/11$ and $\\lambda_{21} = 3/11$.\n\nSince $8/11 \\approx 0.727$ is closer to $1$ than $3/11 \\approx 0.273$, the diagonal pairing ($y_1-u_1$, $y_2-u_2$) is the preferred configuration. It minimizes steady-state interaction between the control loops. The values are not extremely close to $1$, suggesting that a moderate level of interaction will still be present, but this pairing is nonetheless the superior choice.\n\nThe final answer required is the value of the off-diagonal entry $\\lambda_{12}$. From our computation, this is $\\frac{3}{11}$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\frac{3}{11}}\n$$", "id": "2739795"}, {"introduction": "The true utility of the $RGA$ lies in its ability to uncover non-obvious system behaviors.

The open-loop gain is the change in $y_1$ with respect to $u_1$ while all other inputs (here, $u_2$) are held constant.

To find this, we must express how $u_2$ must change to keep $y_2$ constant as $u_1$ changes. From the second system equation, if $y_2$ is constant, its total differential $dy_2$ is zero.\n$$\ndy_2 = g_{21} du_1 + g_{22} du_2 = 0\n$$\nThis implies a relationship between the differentials $du_1$ and $du_2$:\n$$\n\\frac{du_2}{du_1} = -\\frac{g_{21}}{g_{22}}\n$$\nNow, we find the total differential of $y_1$:\n$$\ndy_1 = g_{11} du_1 + g_{12} du_2\n$$\nThe closed-loop gain is the ratio $dy_1/du_1$ under the constraint that $y_2$ is constant.\n$$\n\\left(\\frac{\\partial y_1}{\\partial u_1}\\right)_{y_2=\\text{const}} = g_{11} + g_{12} \\left(\\frac{du_2}{du_1}\\right) = g_{11} + g_{12}\\left(-\\frac{g_{21}}{g_{22}}\\right) = \\frac{g_{11}g_{22} - g_{12}g_{21}}{g_{22}}\n$$\nThe numerator is the determinant of $G$, $\\det(G)$.\n$$\n\\left(\\frac{\\partial y_1}{\\partial u_1}\\right)_{y_2=\\text{const}} = \\frac{\\det(G)}{g_{22}}\n$$\nNow, we can compute $\\lambda_{11}$:\n$$\n\\lambda_{11} = \\frac{g_{11}}{\\frac{\\det(G)}{g_{22}}} = \\frac{g_{11}g_{22}}{\\det(G)}\n$$\nWe compute the determinant of $G$:\n$$\n\\det(G) = (4)(0.1) - (1)(1) = 0.4 - 1 = -0.6\n$$\nSubstituting numerical values into the expression for $\\lambda_{11}$:\n$$\n\\lambda_{11} = \\frac{(4)(0.1)}{-0.6} = \\frac{0.4}{-0.6} = -\\frac{2}{3}\n$$\nFor a $2 \\times 2$ system, the RGA matrix has the property that the sum of elements in any row or column is $1$. This gives the structure:\n$$\n\\Lambda(G) = \\begin{bmatrix} \\lambda_{11} & 1-\\lambda_{11} \\\\ 1-\\lambda_{11} & \\lambda_{11} \\end{bmatrix}\n$$\nUsing our computed value $\\lambda_{11} = -2/3$:\n$$\n\\lambda_{12} = 1 - \\lambda_{11} = 1 - \\left(-\\frac{2}{3}\\right) = \\frac{5}{3}\n$$\n$$\n\\lambda_{21} = 1 - \\lambda_{11} = \\frac{5}{3}\n$$\n$$\n\\lambda_{22} = \\lambda_{11} = -\\frac{2}{3}\n$$\nThus, the Relative Gain Array is:\n$$\n\\Lambda(G) = \\begin{bmatrix} -2/3 & 5/3 \\\\ 5/3 & -2/3 \\end{bmatrix}\n$$\nNext, we analyze the implications for input-output pairing. For decentralized control, one seeks to pair inputs and outputs such that the corresponding diagonal elements of $\\Lambda(G)$ are positive and close to $1$. The proposed pairing is $y_1-u_1$ and $y_2-u_2$. The corresponding RGA elements are $\\lambda_{11}$ and $\\lambda_{22}$. We found that $\\lambda_{11} = \\lambda_{22} = -2/3$. A negative relative gain indicates a severe problem for decentralized control.\nThe physical meaning of $\\lambda_{11} < 0$ is that the gain of the process from $u_1$ to $y_1$ reverses its sign when the second loop $(y_2, u_2)$ is closed, compared to when it is open.\nThe open-loop gain is $g_{11} = 4$, which is positive.\nThe closed-loop gain is $(\\partial y_1 / \\partial u_1)_{y_2=\\text{const}} = \\det(G)/g_{22} = -0.6/0.1 = -6$, which is negative.\nThis sign reversal is extremely risky. A controller for the first loop, designed assuming a positive process gain (as is the case in open loop), would provide incorrect control action when the second loop is closed and active. For example, a proportional controller with positive gain would create positive feedback, leading to instability. Therefore, even though all steady-state gains $g_{ij}$ are positive, the strong interaction between the loops makes the diagonal pairing $y_1-u_1, y_2-u_2$ fundamentally flawed and likely unstable. The alternative pairing, $y_1-u_2$ and $y_2-u_1$, corresponds to $\\lambda_{12}=\\lambda_{21}=5/3$, which, being positive, is a much better choice, although the deviation from $1$ still indicates significant interaction.\n\nFinally, we compute the Niederlinski index $N$. This index provides a necessary condition for the stability of a decentralized control system with integral action. For a diagonal pairing, stability requires $N > 0$. The definition is:\n$$\nN = \\frac{\\det(G)}{\\prod_{i=1}^{2} g_{ii}}\n$$\nWe have already calculated the necessary components:\n$$\n\\det(G) = -0.6\n$$\n$$\n\\prod_{i=1}^{2} g_{ii} = g_{11} g_{22} = (4)(0.1) = 0.4\n$$\nSubstituting these values:\n$$\nN = \\frac{-0.6}{0.4} = -\\frac{6}{4} = -\\frac{3}{2} = -1.5\n$$\nSince $N < 0$, the Niederlinski stability criterion is not satisfied. This confirms that a decentralized control system implementing the pairing $y_1-u_1, y_2-u_2$ with integral controllers would be unstable at steady state.
