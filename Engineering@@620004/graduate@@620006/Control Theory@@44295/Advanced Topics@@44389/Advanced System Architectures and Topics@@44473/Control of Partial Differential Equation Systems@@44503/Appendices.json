The final answer must be a single analytic expression as specified.", "solution": "The problem presented is a standard one in the theory of partial differential equations and their control. It is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and contains all necessary information for its resolution. I will proceed with the solution.\n\nThe problem requires the completion of two tasks. First, the construction of the explicit solution to the given transport equation. Second, the application of the lifting method to transform the problem with an inhomogeneous boundary condition into one with a homogeneous boundary condition and an in-domain source.\n\n**Task 1: Explicit Solution via Method of Characteristics**\n\nThe governing partial differential equation is the one-dimensional linear transport equation:\n$$\nu_{t}(x,t) + u_{x}(x,t) = 0, \\quad x \\in (0,1), t>0.\n$$\nThis equation states that the directional derivative of the solution $u(x,t)$ along the vector $(1,1)$ in the $(t,x)$-plane is zero. This implies that the solution $u$ is constant along the characteristic curves defined by $\\frac{dx}{dt} = 1$. The solutions to this ordinary differential equation are the family of parallel lines $x-t = C$, where $C$ is a constant.\n\nConsequently, the general solution of the PDE is of the form $u(x,t) = F(x-t)$ for some function $F$. The specific form of $F$ is determined by the initial and boundary conditions. To find the value of $u$ at a point $(x,t)$ in the domain $x \\in (0,1), t>0$, we must trace the characteristic line $x'-t' = x-t$ back to where it intersects the boundary of the domain, which consists of the initial line $\\{ (x',0) | x' \\in (0,1) \\}$ and the inflow boundary $\\{ (0,t') | t' > 0 \\}$.\n\nCase 1: The characteristic intersects the initial line.\nThis occurs if the point $(x-t, 0)$ lies on the initial line segment, which requires $0 < x-t < 1$. Given $x \\in (0,1)$ and $t>0$, this corresponds to the region defined by $t < x < 1$. In this region, the solution value is determined by the initial condition $u_0(x)$:\n$$\nu(x,t) = u(x-t, 0) = u_0(x-t).\n$$\n\nCase 2: The characteristic intersects the inflow boundary.\nThis occurs if the point $(0, t-x)$ lies on the inflow boundary, which requires $t-x > 0$, or $x < t$. Given $x \\in (0,1)$ and $t>0$, this corresponds to the region $0 < x < t$. In this region, the solution value is determined by the boundary condition $g(t)$:\n$$\nu(x,t) = u(0, t-x) = g(t-x).\n$$\n\nWe can combine these two cases using the indicator function $\\mathbf{1}_{E}(y)$, which is $1$ if $y \\in E$ and $0$ otherwise. For any point $(x,t)$ with $x \\in (0,1)$ and $t>0$, one of two conditions, $x>t$ or $x<t$, will hold (we neglect the line $x=t$ of measure zero).\nThe condition $t < x < 1$ is equivalent to $x \\in (t,1)$.\nThe condition $0 < x < t$ is equivalent to $x \\in (0,t)$.\nNote that if $t \\ge 1$, the interval $(t,1)$ is empty, so $\\mathbf{1}_{(t,1)}(x) = 0$ for all $x \\in (0,1)$. In this scenario, $x < t$ for all $x \\in (0,1)$, and the solution is determined entirely by the boundary data $g$. The expression remains correct.\n\nTherefore, the explicit closed-form solution is:\n$$\nu(x,t) = u_0(x-t) \\mathbf{1}_{(t,1)}(x) + g(t-x) \\mathbf{1}_{(0,t)}(x).\n$$\nThis expression is the complete solution in terms of the initial data $u_0$ and boundary data $g$. The problem refers to this as the \"semigroup solution,\" which is appropriate as this form can be derived from the Duhamel's principle applied to the abstract evolution equation with boundary control, although the method of characteristics provides the most direct path to this explicit formula.\n\n**Task 2: Lifting Method**\n\nThe second task is to find a lifting profile $\\ell(x)$ and a source term $q(x,t)$ for the transformed variable $z(x,t) = u(x,t) - \\ell(x)g(t)$. The purpose of this transformation is to obtain an equivalent system for $z(x,t)$ that has a homogeneous boundary condition at $x=0$.\n\nFirst, we impose the condition $z(0,t)=0$. Substituting the definition of $z(x,t)$ and the given boundary condition $u(0,t)=g(t)$:\n$$\nz(0,t) = u(0,t) - \\ell(0)g(t) = g(t) - \\ell(0)g(t) = (1 - \\ell(0))g(t).\n$$\nFor $z(0,t)$ to be zero for any locally absolutely continuous function $g(t)$, we must enforce the condition on the profile $\\ell(x)$:\n$$\n\\ell(0) = 1.\n$$\nNext, we derive the PDE for $z(x,t)$. We compute the partial derivatives of $u(x,t) = z(x,t) + \\ell(x)g(t)$:\n$$\nu_t(x,t) = z_t(x,t) + \\ell(x)g'(t),\n$$\n$$\nu_x(x,t) = z_x(x,t) + \\ell'(x)g(t).\n$$\nSubstituting these into the original PDE $u_t+u_x=0$:\n$$\n(z_t(x,t) + \\ell(x)g'(t)) + (z_x(x,t) + \\ell'(x)g(t)) = 0.\n$$\nRearranging the terms, we obtain the PDE for $z(x,t)$:\n$$\nz_t(x,t) + z_x(x,t) = -\\ell'(x)g(t) - \\ell(x)g'(t).\n$$\nThe right-hand side is the equivalent in-domain source term, which the problem denotes as $q(x,t)$:\n$$\nq(x,t) = -\\ell'(x)g(t) - \\ell(x)g'(t).\n$$\nThe problem asks for an explicit spatial profile $\\ell(x)$. We have the condition $\\ell(0)=1$. There are infinitely many functions in $H^1(0,1)$ that satisfy this. A guiding principle in such problems is to select the simplest possible function that satisfies the requirements, so as not to introduce unnecessary complexity into the resulting equation.\n\nThe simplest non-trivial choice is a constant function. Let us set $\\ell(x) = 1$ for all $x \\in (0,1)$.\nThis function clearly satisfies $\\ell(0)=1$ and is in $H^1(0,1)$ (in fact, it is in $C^\\infty[0,1]$). Its derivative is $\\ell'(x) = 0$.\n\nWith this choice, the source term $q(x,t)$ simplifies significantly:\n$$\nq(x,t) = -(0)g(t) - (1)g'(t) = -g'(t).\n$$\nThe existence of $g'(t)$ as a locally square-integrable function is guaranteed by the given condition $g \\in H^1_{\\mathrm{loc}}([0,\\infty))$. This choice of $\\ell(x)=1$ results in a source term that is spatially uniform, which is a considerable simplification for further analysis. This is the canonical choice for this type of problem.\n\nIn summary:\n1. The explicit solution is $u(x,t) = u_0(x-t) \\mathbf{1}_{(t,1)}(x) + g(t-x) \\mathbf{1}_{(0,t)}(x)$.\n2. The lifting profile is $\\ell(x) = 1$.\n3.

Since the operators $A, B, Q, R$ are all diagonal in the chosen eigenbasis (with $B=I, Q=qI, R=rI$), the solution $P$ is also diagonal, with entries $p_k$. Applying the ARE to each mode $k$ yields a scalar ARE:\n$$\n2a_k p_k - \\frac{1}{r}p_k^2 + q = 0\n$$\nThis is a quadratic equation for $p_k$:\n$$\np_k^2 - 2ra_k p_k - qr = 0\n$$\nSubstituting $a_k = -\\alpha k^2\\pi^2$, we obtain:\n$$\np_k^2 + 2r\\alpha k^2\\pi^2 p_k - qr = 0\n$$\nThe solution for $p_k$ is given by the quadratic formula. Since $P$ must be a non-negative operator, its eigenvalues $p_k$ must be non-negative. We thus select the positive root:\n$$\np_k = \\frac{-2r\\alpha k^2\\pi^2 + \\sqrt{(2r\\alpha k^2\\pi^2)^2 - 4(1)(-qr)}}{2} = -r\\alpha k^2\\pi^2 + \\sqrt{(r\\alpha k^2\\pi^2)^2 + qr}\n$$\nThis formula is used to compute $p_1, p_2, p_3$ for each parameter set.\n\n**Task 2: Estimation of the Decay Rate $\\delta$**\n\nThe optimal LQR feedback law is $u = -Kx = -R^{-1}B^*Px$. In modal coordinates, this becomes $u_k = - (1/r) p_k x_k$. The closed-loop dynamics for each mode are:\n$$\n\\dot{x}_k(t) = a_k x_k(t) + u_k(t) = (a_k - \\frac{1}{r}p_k)x_k(t)\n$$\nThe closed-loop eigenvalues are $a_k^{\\mathrm{cl}} = a_k - \\frac{1}{r}p_k$. Substituting the expression for $p_k$:\n$$\na_k^{\\mathrm{cl}} = -\\alpha k^2\\pi^2 - \\frac{1}{r}\\left(-r\\alpha k^2\\pi^2 + \\sqrt{(r\\alpha k^2\\pi^2)^2 + qr}\\right)\n$$\n$$\na_k^{\\mathrm{cl}} = -\\alpha k^2\\pi^2 + \\alpha k^2\\pi^2 - \\frac{1}{r}\\sqrt{(r\\alpha k^2\\pi^2)^2 + qr} = -\\sqrt{\\alpha^2 k^4\\pi^4 + \\frac{q}{r}}\n$$\nThis expression is correct. The closed-loop eigenvalues $a_k^{\\mathrm{cl}}$ are all real and negative, and $|a_k^{\\mathrm{cl}}|$ is a strictly increasing function of $k$.\nThe norm of the truncated semigroup is defined as $\\|T_K(t)\\| = \\max_{1 \\le k \\le K_{\\max}} \\exp(a_k^{\\mathrm{cl}} t)$. Since $a_k^{\\mathrm{cl}}$ are negative and $t \\ge 0$, the exponential term is maximized when the exponent is least negative. This occurs for the smallest value of $k$, i.e., $k=1$.\nTherefore, for any $K_{\\max} \\ge 1$:\n$$\n\\|T_K(t)\\| = \\exp(a_1^{\\mathrm{cl}} t)\n$$\nTaking the natural logarithm:\n$$\n\\log\\|T_K(t_j)\\| = a_1^{\\mathrm{cl}} t_j\n$$\nThis shows that the data points $(t_j, \\log\\|T_K(t_j)\\|)$ lie perfectly on a line through the origin with slope $m = a_1^{\\mathrm{cl}}$.\nThe problem mandates estimating the decay rate $\\delta$ as the negative of the best-fit slope from a least-squares linear regression. The slope will be exactly $a_1^{\\mathrm{cl}}$, so the decay rate is $\\delta = -m = -a_1^{\\mathrm{cl}}$.\n$$\n\\delta = -a_1^{\\mathrm{cl}} = \\sqrt{\\alpha^2 (1)^4\\pi^4 + \\frac{q}{r}} = \\sqrt{\\alpha^2 \\pi^4 + \\frac{q}{r}}\n$$\nThe implementation will perform the linear regression explicitly as instructed, using the formula for the slope $m$ of a best-fit line $y=mx+c$:\n$$\nm = \\frac{n \\sum(t_j y_j) - (\\sum t_j)(\\sum y_j)}{n \\sum(t_j^2) - (\\sum t_j)^2}\n$$\nwhere $n$ is the number of time points and $y_j = \\log\\|T_K(t_j)\\|$. The decay rate is then $\\delta = -m$.", "answer": "```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves the LQR problem for the 1D heat equation for specified test cases.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Define the test cases from the problem statement.\n    # Each case is a tuple: (alpha, q, r, N, K_max, t_j_list)\n    test_cases = [\n        (1.0, 1.0, 0.5, 6, 80, [0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, 1.0]),\n        (0.7, 2.0, 1.0, 8, 80, [0.1, 0.3, 0.5, 0.7, 0.9]),\n        (1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 10, 80, [0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0]),\n    ]\n\n    all_results = []\n    \n    for case in test_cases:\n        alpha, q, r, N, K_max, t_j = case\n        \n        # --- Task 1: Compute p_1, p_2, p_3 ---\n        # The diagonal entries of the Riccati solution P are given by:\n        # p_k = -r*alpha*k^2*pi^2 + sqrt((r*alpha*k^2*pi^2)^2 + q*r)\n        \n        p_values = []\n        for k in range(1, 4):  # for k=1, 2, 3\n            term1 = r * alpha * (k * np.pi)**2\n            p_k = -term1 + np.sqrt(term1**2 + q * r)\n            p_values.append(p_k)\n            \n        p1, p2, p3 = [round(p, 6) for p in p_values]\n\n        # --- Task 2: Estimate the decay rate delta ---\n        # The closed-loop eigenvalues are a_k^cl = -sqrt(alpha^2 * k^4 * pi^4 + q/r)\n        # The semigroup norm is dominated by the slowest mode (k=1).\n        # ||T_K(t)|| = exp(a_1^cl * t)\n        \n        a1_cl = -np.sqrt(alpha**2 * np.pi**4 + q / r)\n        \n        # We must perform a least-squares fit as per the instructions.\n        # The data points are (t_j, log(||T_K(t_j)||)).\n        # y_j = log(exp(a_1^cl * t_j)) = a_1^cl * t_j\n        t_array = np.array(t_j)\n        y_array = a1_cl * t_array\n        \n        n = len(t_array)\n        sum_t = np.sum(t_array)\n        sum_y = np.sum(y_array)\n        sum_t_sq = np.sum(t_array**2)\n        sum_ty = np.sum(t_array * y_array)\n        \n        # Standard formula for the slope of a linear regression line y = m*x + c\n        # m = (n * sum(xy) - sum(x)*sum(y)) / (n * sum(x^2) - (sum(x))^2)\n        # We expect the calculated slope 'm' to be equal to a1_cl.\n        numerator = n * sum_ty - sum_t * sum_y\n        denominator = n * sum_t_sq - sum_t**2\n        \n        # denominator can be zero if all t_j are the same; handle this improbable case.\n        if denominator == 0:\n            # If all time points are the same but there is more than one point,\n            # the slope is undefined.
