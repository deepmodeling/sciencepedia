The discrete-time state-transition matrix, under a zero-order hold assumption on the input (which is zero in this autonomous system), is defined as the matrix exponential of $A$ scaled by the sampling period $T$.\n$$\nA_{d}(T) = \\exp(AT)\n$$\nWe begin by analyzing the structure of the matrix $A$. $A$ is an upper triangular matrix, so its eigenvalues are its diagonal entries. We have a repeated eigenvalue $\\lambda_{1,2} = -2$. To determine if the matrix is diagonalizable or defective, we find the eigenspace corresponding to this eigenvalue. The eigenvectors $v$ are the non-zero solutions to $(A - \\lambda I)v = 0$.\n$$\n(A - (-2)I)v = \\begin{bmatrix} -2 - (-2)  3 \\\\ 0  -2 - (-2) \\end{bmatrix} \\begin{bmatrix} v_1 \\\\ v_2 \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} 0  3 \\\\ 0  0 \\end{bmatrix} \\begin{bmatrix} v_1 \\\\ v_2 \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} 0 \\\\ 0 \\end{bmatrix}\n$$\nThis matrix equation simplifies to the single linear equation $3v_2 = 0$, which implies $v_2 = 0$. The component $v_1$ is unconstrained. Thus, all eigenvectors are of the form $v = c \\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{bmatrix}$ for some non-zero scalar $c$. The eigenspace has a dimension of $1$. Since the algebraic multiplicity of the eigenvalue $\\lambda = -2$ is $2$, but its geometric multiplicity (the dimension of the eigenspace) is $1$, the matrix $A$ is defective and cannot be diagonalized.\n\nTo compute the matrix exponential $\\exp(AT)$, we decompose the matrix $A$ into a sum of two commuting matrices: a diagonal matrix $D$ and a nilpotent matrix $N$. This is the Jordan-Chevalley decomposition.\nLet $D$ be the diagonal part of $A$, and $N$ be the strictly upper triangular part.\n$$\nD = -2I = \\begin{bmatrix} -2  0 \\\\ 0  -2 \\end{bmatrix}\n$$\n$$\nN = A - D = \\begin{bmatrix} -2  3 \\\\ 0  -2 \\end{bmatrix} - \\begin{bmatrix} -2  0 \\\\ 0  -2 \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} 0  3 \\\\ 0  0 \\end{bmatrix}\n$$\nFor the property $\\exp(X+Y) = \\exp(X)\\exp(Y)$ to hold for matrices, it is required that $X$ and $Y$ commute, i.e., $XY=YX$. We verify this for our decomposition $A = D+N$.\n$$\nDN = (-2I)N = -2N\n$$\n$$\nND = N(-2I) = -2N\n$$\nSince $DN=ND$, the matrices commute. Therefore, we can write:\n$$\n\\exp(AT) = \\exp((D+N)T) = \\exp(DT + NT) = \\exp(DT)\\exp(NT)\n$$\nWe now compute each exponential term separately. First, for $\\exp(DT)$:\nSince $DT = -2TI = \\begin{bmatrix} -2T  0 \\\\ 0  -2T \\end{bmatrix}$ is a diagonal matrix, its exponential is found by taking the exponential of each diagonal element.\n$$\n\\exp(DT) = \\begin{bmatrix} \\exp(-2T)  0 \\\\ 0  \\exp(-2T) \\end{bmatrix} = \\exp(-2T)I\n$$\nNext, we compute $\\exp(NT)$.

The definition of the matrix exponential is given by its Taylor series expansion:\n$$\n\\exp(X) = \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} \\frac{X^k}{k!} = I + X + \\frac{X^2}{2!} + \\frac{X^3}{3!} + \\dots\n$$\nSubstituting $X = NT$, we have:\n$$\n\\exp(NT) = I + NT + \\frac{(NT)^2}{2!} + \\frac{(NT)^3}{3!} + \\dots\n$$\nAs $(NT)^k = T^k N^k$ and $N^k=0$ for $k \\geq 2$, the series terminates after the second term.\n$$\n\\exp(NT) = I + NT = \\begin{bmatrix} 1  0 \\\\ 0  1 \\end{bmatrix} + T\\begin{bmatrix} 0  3 \\\\ 0  0 \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} 1  3T \\\\ 0  1 \\end{bmatrix}\n$$\nFinally, we combine the results to find $A_d(T)$.\n$$\nA_d(T) = \\exp(AT) = \\exp(DT)\\exp(NT) = \\left(\\exp(-2T)I\\right) \\left(I + NT\\right)\n$$\n$$\nA_d(T) = \\exp(-2T) \\begin{bmatrix} 1  3T \\\\ 0  1 \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} \\exp(-2T)  3T\\exp(-2T) \\\\ 0  \\exp(-2T) \\end{bmatrix}\n$$\nThe appearance of the term $3T\\exp(-2T)$, which is a polynomial in $T$ multiplying the exponential term, is a direct consequence of the defectiveness of the matrix $A$. The decomposition $A = D+N$ contains a non-zero nilpotent part $N$. The exponential of the nilpotent part, $\\exp(NT)$, generates a matrix polynomial in $T$ because its Taylor series is finite. In this case, the series gives $I+NT$. When multiplied by $\\exp(DT) = \\exp(-2T)I$, this polynomial term persists, leading to the characteristic $T\\exp(\\lambda T)$ form in the solution for systems with defective matrices. If $A$ were diagonalizable, $N$ would be the zero matrix, and no such polynomial terms would appear.
