The analysis is based on multiple Lyapunov functions, one for each mode of the system.\n\nLet us formalize the given conditions. The system has a set of modes $\\mathcal{P}=\\{1, 2, \\dots, m\\}$. For each mode $i \\in \\mathcal{P}$, there is a Lyapunov function $V_i(x)$.\n\nThe first condition describes the behavior of the Lyapunov function during a continuous flow interval. For any trajectory $x(t)$ evolving under a single mode $i$, the time derivative of the corresponding Lyapunov function $V_i$ satisfies the differential inequality:\n$$\n\\frac{dV_i(x(t))}{dt} \\le -\\alpha V_i(x(t))\n$$\nwhere $\\alpha > 0$ is a constant. By the comparison lemma (or GrÃ¶nwall's inequality), for any time interval $[t_a, t_b]$ during which the mode is constant and equal to $i$, the Lyapunov function value is bounded by:\n$$\nV_i(x(t_b)) \\le V_i(x(t_a)) \\exp(-\\alpha(t_b - t_a))\n$$\n\nThe second condition describes the behavior at switching instants. When a switch from mode $i$ to mode $j$ occurs at time $t_k$, the Lyapunov functions are related by the inequality:\n$$\nV_j(x(t_k^+)) \\le \\mu V_i(x(t_k^-))\n$$\nwhere $\\mu > 1$ is a constant, and $t_k^-$ and $t_k^+$ denote the time instances immediately before and after the switch, respectively. The state $x$ is assumed to be continuous, so $x(t_k^+) = x(t_k^-)$.\n\nThe problem defines a worst-case cycle as a flow interval of minimal duration $\\tau_d > 0$ followed by a single switch. Let us analyze such a cycle. Suppose the cycle starts at time $t_0$. The system is in some mode, say $i \\in \\mathcal{P}$. The corresponding Lyapunov value is $V_i(x(t_0))$.\n\nThe system evolves in mode $i$ for a duration of $\\tau_d$. The flow interval is $[t_0, t_0+\\tau_d]$. At the end of this interval, just before the switch at time $t_1 = t_0 + \\tau_d$, the Lyapunov value $V_i(x(t_1^-))$ is bounded by the decay property:\n$$\nV_i(x(t_1^-)) \\le V_i(x(t_0)) \\exp(-\\alpha \\tau_d)\n$$\n\nAt time $t_1$, a switch occurs from mode $i$ to some mode $j \\in \\mathcal{P}$.

Both subsystems are stable since the eigenvalues of $A_{1}$ and $A_{2}$ are $\\{-1, -1\\}$. We construct a periodic switching signal that alternates between the two modes with an equal dwell-time $\\tau$ for each. Let the period be $T = 2\\tau$. Over one period, starting in mode $1$, the state evolves according to $x(t) = \\exp(A_{1}t)x(0)$ for $t \\in [0, \\tau)$ and then switches to mode $2$. The state at the end of the period is given by $x(2\\tau) = \\exp(A_{2}\\tau)x(\\tau) = \\exp(A_{2}\\tau)\\exp(A_{1}\\tau)x(0)$.\n\nThe stability of this periodic system is determined by the spectral radius of the monodromy matrix $\\Phi(\\tau) = \\exp(A_{2}\\tau)\\exp(A_{1}\\tau)$. The system is unstable if $\\rho(\\Phi(\\tau)) > 1$.\n\nFirst, we compute the matrix exponentials. For $A_{1}$:\n$A_{1} = \\begin{pmatrix} -1 & 3 \\\\ 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix} = -I + N_{1}$, where $N_{1} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 3 \\\\ 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$. Since $-I$ and $N_{1}$ commute, $\\exp(A_{1}\\tau) = \\exp(-I\\tau)\\exp(N_{1}\\tau)$. As $N_{1}^{2} = 0$, the series for the exponential truncates: $\\exp(N_{1}\\tau) = I + N_{1}\\tau = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 3\\tau \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$.\nThus, $\\exp(A_{1}\\tau) = \\exp(-\\tau)I (I+N_{1}\\tau) = \\exp(-\\tau)\\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 3\\tau \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$.\n\nSimilarly, for $A_{2}$:\n$A_{2} = \\begin{pmatrix} -1 & 0 \\\\ 3 & -1 \\end{pmatrix} = -I + N_{2}$, where $N_{2} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 \\\\ 3 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$.

The Lyapunov equation yields:\n$$ \\begin{pmatrix} -2p_{11} & 3p_{11}-2p_{12} \\\\ 3p_{11}-2p_{12} & 6p_{12}-2p_{22} \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} -1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix} $$\nSolving this system of linear equations gives:\n$p_{11} = \\frac{1}{2}$, $p_{12} = \\frac{3}{4}$, $p_{22} = \\frac{11}{4}$.\nSo, $P_1 = \\begin{pmatrix} 1/2 & 3/4 \\\\ 3/4 & 11/4 \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{1}{4}\\begin{pmatrix} 2 & 3 \\\\ 3 & 11 \\end{pmatrix}$. This matrix is positive definite as its leading principal minors are $1/2 > 0$ and $\\det(P_1) = (1/4)^2(22-9)=13/16 > 0$.\n\nFor $i=2$: $A_2 = \\begin{pmatrix} -1 & 0 \\\\ 3 & -1 \\end{pmatrix} = A_1^{\\top}$. The Lyapunov equation for $P_2$ is $A_2^{\\top}P_2 + P_2 A_2 = A_1 P_2 + P_2 A_1^{\\top} = -I$. One can verify that $P_2$ is related to $P_1$ by symmetry. Specifically, $P_2 = \\begin{pmatrix} 11/4 & 3/4 \\\\ 3/4 & 1/2 \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{1}{4}\\begin{pmatrix} 11 & 3 \\\\ 3 & 2 \\end{pmatrix}$.\n\nThe time derivative of $V_i(x)$ along trajectories of system $i$ is $\\dot{V}_i(x) = x^{\\top}(A_i^{\\top}P_i + P_i A_i)x = -x^{\\top}Ix = -\\|x\\|_2^2$. We need to find decay rates $c_i>0$ such that $\\dot{V}_i(x) \\leq -c_i V_i(x)$, which is equivalent to $-\\|x\\|_2^2 \\leq -c_i x^{\\top}P_i x$, or $x^{\\top}P_i x \\leq \\frac{1}{c_i}\\|x\\|_2^2$. This inequality holds if $\\lambda_{max}(P_i) \\leq 1/c_i$. The best rate is obtained by choosing $c_i = 1/\\lambda_{max}(P_i)$.\nThe eigenvalues of $P_1$ are roots of $\\lambda^2 - \\text{tr}(P_1)\\lambda + \\det(P_1) = 0$, i.e., $\\lambda^2 - \\frac{13}{4}\\lambda + \\frac{13}{16} = 0$. The roots are $\\lambda = \\frac{13 \\pm 3\\sqrt{13}}{8}$. $P_2$ has the same eigenvalues. Thus, $\\lambda_{max}(P_1) = \\lambda_{max}(P_2) = \\frac{13+3\\sqrt{13}}{8}$.\nThe decay rates are identical: $c_1 = c_2 = c = \\frac{8}{13+3\\sqrt{13}}$.\n\nNext, we find $\\mu \\ge 1$ such that $V_j(x) \\le \\mu V_i(x)$ for all $x \\ne 0$, $i \\ne j$. This is given by $\\mu = \\max\\{\\lambda_{max}(P_1^{-1}P_2), \\lambda_{max}(P_2^{-1}P_1)\\}$.\n$P_1^{-1} = \\frac{1}{\\det(P_1)}\\begin{pmatrix} 11/4 & -3/4 \\\\ -3/4 & 1/2 \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{16}{13} \\begin{pmatrix} 11/4 & -3/4 \\\\ -3/4 & 1/2 \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{4}{13}\\begin{pmatrix} 11 & -3 \\\\ -3 & 2 \\end{pmatrix}$.\n$P_1^{-1}P_2 = \\frac{4}{13}\\begin{pmatrix} 11 & -3 \\\\ -3 & 2 \\end{pmatrix} \\frac{1}{4}\\begin{pmatrix} 11 & 3 \\\\ 3 & 2 \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{1}{13}\\begin{pmatrix} 112 & 27 \\\\ -27 & -5 \\end{pmatrix}$.\nThe characteristic equation is $\\lambda^2 - \\text{tr}(P_1^{-1}P_2)\\lambda + \\det(P_1^{-1}P_2) = 0$.\n$\\text{tr}(P_1^{-1}P_2) = \\frac{112-5}{13} = \\frac{107}{13}$.\n$\\det(P_1^{-1}P_2) = \\det(P_1^{-1})\\det(P_2) = 1$.\nSo, $\\lambda^2 - \\frac{107}{13}\\lambda + 1 = 0$. The eigenvalues are reciprocals. $\\lambda_{max}(P_2^{-1}P_1) = \\lambda_{max}((P_1^{-1}P_2)^{-1}) = 1/\\lambda_{min}(P_1^{-1}P_2) = \\lambda_{max}(P_1^{-1}P_2)$.\nHence, $\\mu = \\lambda_{max}(P_1^{-1}P_2) = \\frac{\\frac{107}{13} + \\sqrt{(\\frac{107}{13})^2-4}}{2} = \\frac{107 + \\sqrt{107^2 - 4 \\cdot 13^2}}{26} = \\frac{107 + \\sqrt{11449 - 676}}{26} = \\frac{107 + \\sqrt{10773}}{26}$.\n\nFor a switching signal with dwell-time $\\tau_k$ for the $k$-th interval, we have $V_{\\sigma_k}(x(t_{k+1})) \\le \\exp(-c \\tau_k) V_{\\sigma_k}(x(t_k))$. At switching, $V_{\\sigma_{k+1}}(x(t_{k+1})) \\le \\mu V_{\\sigma_k}(x(t_{k+1}))$. Combining these, $V_{\\sigma_{k+1}}(x(t_{k+1})) \\le \\mu \\exp(-c\\tau_k)V_{\\sigma_k}(x(t_k))$.\nFor stability, we require $\\mu\\exp(-c\\tau_k) < 1$ for all $k$. If the minimum dwell-time is $\\tau_d$, this condition becomes $\\mu\\exp(-c\\tau_d) < 1$, which gives $\\exp(c\\tau_d) > \\mu$, so $\\tau_d > \\frac{\\ln\\mu}{c}$. A sufficient dwell-time lower bound is thus $\\tau_d = \\frac{\\ln\\mu}{c}$.\n\n**Part 3: Evaluation of the Dwell-Time Bound**\n\nWe substitute the derived expressions for $c$ and $\\mu$ into the formula for $\\tau_d$.\n$$ c = \\frac{8}{13 + 3\\sqrt{13}} $$\n$$ \\mu = \\frac{107 + \\sqrt{10773}}{26} $$\nThe sufficient dwell-time bound $\\tau_d$ is:\n$$ \\tau_d = \\frac{\\ln \\mu}{c} = \\frac{\\ln\\left(\\frac{107 + \\sqrt{10773}}{26}\\right)}{\\frac{8}{13 + 3\\sqrt{13}}} = \\frac{13 + 3\\sqrt{13}}{8} \\ln\\left(\\frac{107 + \\sqrt{10773}}{26}\\right). $$\nThis is the exact, closed-form expression for the dwell-time bound.
