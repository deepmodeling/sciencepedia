It is based on fundamental principles of linear systems theory and robust control, specifically the concepts of impulse response, the $\\mathcal{L}_1$ norm of an LTI system, and the small-gain theorem. All terms are standard and well-defined in the field of control theory. The problem is self-contained, providing all necessary definitions and context to proceed with both the calculation and the explanation. There are no contradictions, ambiguities, or factual inaccuracies. The problem is a standard exercise in robust and adaptive control theory. Therefore, the problem is deemed valid.\n\nThe task is twofold: first, to compute the $\\mathcal{L}_1$ norm of the given low-pass filter, and second, to explain the origin of the small-gain stability condition in this context.\n\nPart 1: Computation of $\\lVert C \\rVert_{\\mathcal{L}_1}$.\nThe transfer function of the filter is given by $C(s) = \\dfrac{\\omega_c}{s + \\omega_c}$. The impulse response $h(t)$ is the inverse Laplace transform of $C(s)$. For a causal system, this is:\n$$\nh(t) = \\mathcal{L}^{-1}\\left\\{ C(s) \\right\\}(t) = \\mathcal{L}^{-1}\\left\\{ \\frac{\\omega_c}{s + \\omega_c} \\right\\}(t)\n$$\nUsing the standard Laplace transform pair $\\mathcal{L}^{-1}\\left\\{ \\frac{1}{s+a} \\right\\}(t) = \\exp(-at)u(t)$, where $u(t)$ is the Heaviside step function, we find:\n$$\nh(t) = \\omega_c \\exp(-\\omega_c t) u(t)\n$$\nThe $\\mathcal{L}_1$ norm is defined as the integral of the absolute value of the impulse response.\n$$\n\\lVert C \\rVert_{\\mathcal{L}_1} = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} |h(t)| \\,\\mathrm{d}t = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} |\\omega_c \\exp(-\\omega_c t)| \\,\\mathrm{d}t\n$$\nGiven the constraint $\\omega_c > 0$, and for the domain of integration $t \\ge 0$, the term $\\omega_c \\exp(-\\omega_c t)$ is always non-negative.

Let the external input to the system be $r(t)$ and the output of the LTI operator be $y(t)$. The input to the operator $C$ is an error signal $e(t) = r(t) - w(t)$, where $w(t)$ is the output of the uncertainty block $\\Delta$. The input to the uncertainty block is the output of the operator $C$, so $w(t) = (\\Delta y)(t)$.\n\nThe system dynamics are described by the equation:\n$$\ny(t) = (C * e)(t) = (C * (r - \\Delta y))(t)\n$$\nwhere $*$ denotes convolution. We analyze the stability in the space of bounded signals, using the $\\mathcal{L}_{\\infty}$ norm, defined as $\\lVert x \\rVert_{\\infty} = \\sup_{t \\ge 0} |x(t)|$.\nTaking the $\\mathcal{L}_{\\infty}$ norm of the system equation:\n$$\n\\lVert y \\rVert_{\\infty} = \\lVert C * (r - \\Delta y) \\rVert_{\\infty}\n$$\nUsing the given induced norm bound property for LTI systems, which is a key result from convolution system theory ($\\lVert C*u \\rVert_{\\infty} \\le \\lVert C \\rVert_{\\mathcal{L}_1} \\lVert u \\rVert_{\\infty}$), we have:\n$$\n\\lVert y \\rVert_{\\infty} \\le \\lVert C \\rVert_{\\mathcal{L}_1} \\lVert r - \\Delta y \\rVert_{\\infty}\n$$\nApplying the triangle inequality for norms to the right-hand side:\n$$\n\\lVert y \\rVert_{\\infty} \\le \\lVert C \\rVert_{\\mathcal{L}_1} \\left( \\lVert r \\rVert_{\\infty} + \\lVert \\Delta y \\rVert_{\\infty} \\right)\n$$\nThe uncertainty $\\Delta$ is stated to be memoryless with a gain of at most $L$. This property is formally expressed as:\n$$\n\\lVert \\Delta y \\rVert_{\\infty} \\le L \\lVert y \\rVert_{\\infty}\n$$\nSubstituting this bound into our main inequality yields:\n$$\n\\lVert y \\rVert_{\\infty} \\le \\lVert C \\rVert_{\\mathcal{L}_1} \\left( \\lVert r \\rVert_{\\infty} + L \\lVert y \\rVert_{\\infty} \\right)\n$$\nDistributing the term $\\lVert C \\rVert_{\\mathcal{L}_1}$:\n$$\n\\lVert y \\rVert_{\\infty} \\le \\lVert C \\rVert_{\\mathcal{L}_1} \\lVert r \\rVert_{\\infty} + \\lVert C \\rVert_{\\mathcal{L}_1} L \\lVert y \\rVert_{\\infty}\n$$\nTo solve for a bound on $\\lVert y \\rVert_{\\infty}$, we gather terms involving $\\lVert y \\rVert_{\\infty}$:\n$$\n\\lVert y \\rVert_{\\infty} - \\lVert C \\rVert_{\\mathcal{L}_1} L \\lVert y \\rVert_{\\infty} \\le \\lVert C \\rVert_{\\mathcal{L}_1} \\lVert r \\rVert_{\\infty}\n$$\n$$\n\\left( 1 - \\lVert C \\rVert_{\\mathcal{L}_1} L \\right) \\lVert y \\rVert_{\\infty} \\le \\lVert C \\rVert_{\\mathcal{L}_1} \\lVert r \\rVert_{\\infty}\n$$\nFor the closed-loop system to be BIBO stable, a bounded input $r$ (i.e., $\\lVert r \\rVert_{\\infty} < \\infty$) must produce a bounded output $y$ (i.e., $\\lVert y \\rVert_{\\infty} < \\infty$). This is guaranteed if we can express $\\lVert y \\rVert_{\\infty}$ as being less than or equal to a finite constant multiplied by $\\lVert r \\rVert_{\\infty}$.\nTo isolate $\\lVert y \\rVert_{\\infty}$ in the inequality above, we must divide by the term $(1 - \\lVert C \\rVert_{\\mathcal{L}_1} L)$. For this division to be valid and preserve the inequality direction while ensuring a positive finite bound, the coefficient must be strictly positive:\n$$\n1 - \\lVert C \\rVert_{\\mathcal{L}_1} L > 0\n$$\nThis directly yields the sufficient condition for stability:\n$$\n\\lVert C \\rVert_{\\mathcal{L}_1} L < 1\n$$\nThis is the small-gain theorem: the loop is stable if the product of the gains of the components in the loop ($\\lVert C \\rVert_{\\mathcal{L}_1}$ for the LTI part and $L$ for the uncertainty) is less than one.

It is scientifically grounded in linear control theory, specifically concerning the architecture of $\\mathcal{L}_1$ adaptive controllers. The problem is well-posed, objective, and self-contained. All necessary variables, dynamics, and assumptions are provided to derive the requested transfer function. The assumptions made, such as setting the true uncertainty to zero, are standard techniques in linear systems analysis for isolating the effect of a specific input, in this case, the uncertainty estimate $\\hat{\\sigma}(t)$. No scientific principles are violated, and no information is contradictory or missing.\n\nWe proceed with the derivation.\n\nThe objective is to find the closed-loop transfer function $H(s) = \\frac{U(s)}{\\hat{\\Sigma}(s)}$, where $U(s)$ and $\\hat{\\Sigma}(s)$ are the Laplace transforms of $u(t)$ and $\\hat{\\sigma}(t)$, respectively.\n\nThe system dynamics are given by:\n$$\n\\dot{x}(t)=A\\,x(t)+B\\big(u(t)+\\sigma(t)\\big)\n$$\nUnder the problem's assumption that the true uncertainty $\\sigma(t)$ is zero, the equation simplifies to:\n$$\n\\dot{x}(t)=A\\,x(t)+B\\,u(t)\n$$\nThe total control input is $u(t) = u_{b}(t) + u_f(t) = -Kx(t) + u_f(t)$. Substituting this into the system dynamics yields the closed-loop state equation with $u_f(t)$ as the input:\n$$\n\\dot{x}(t) = A\\,x(t) + B\\big(-Kx(t) + u_f(t)\\big) = (A - BK)x(t) + B u_f(t)\n$$\nWe apply the Laplace transform to this equation. Given the initial condition $x(0)=0$, we obtain:\n$$\nsX(s) = (A - BK)X(s) + B U_f(s)\n$$\nwhere $X(s)$ and $U_f(s)$ are the Laplace transforms of $x(t)$ and $u_f(t)$. We can now solve for the state vector $X(s)$ in terms of the input $U_f(s)$:\n$$\n(sI - A + BK)X(s) = B U_f(s)\n$$\n$$\nX(s) = (sI - A + BK)^{-1}B U_f(s)\n$$\nThis expression relates the state vector to the adaptive control component $u_f(t)$. Our goal is to find the transfer function to the total control input $u(t)$. In the Laplace domain, the total control is:\n$$\nU(s) = -KX(s) + U_f(s)\n$$\nSubstituting the derived expression for $X(s)$:\n$$\nU(s) = -K \\left[ (sI - A + BK)^{-1}B \\right] U_f(s) + U_f(s)\n$$\nFactoring out $U_f(s)$, we find the relationship between $U(s)$ and $U_f(s)$:\n$$\nU(s) = \\left[ 1 - K(sI - A + BK)^{-1}B \\right] U_f(s)\n$$\nThe problem states that $U_f(s) = -C(s)\\hat{\\Sigma}(s)$. Substituting this gives:\n$$\nU(s) = -C(s) \\left[ 1 - K(sI - A + BK)^{-1}B \\right] \\hat{\\Sigma}(s)\n$$\nTherefore, the transfer function $H(s) = \\frac{U(s)}{\\hat{\\Sigma}(s)}$ is:\n$$\nH(s) = -C(s) \\left[ 1 - K(sI - A + BK)^{-1}B \\right]\n$$\nTo obtain the desired form, we simplify the term in the brackets. We use the matrix inversion lemma, also known as the Sherman-Morrison-Woodbury identity. A consequence of this lemma is the identity for sensitivity functions in feedback control, which states:\n$$\n1 - K(sI - A + BK)^{-1}B = \\frac{1}{1 + K(sI-A)^{-1}B}\n$$\nThe term $K(sI-A)^{-1}B$ is the open-loop transfer function from the plant input to the feedback signal, a scalar quantity. The identity holds because the baseline closed-loop system with input $u_f$ and output $-Kx$ has a transfer function of $-K(sI - (A-BK))^{-1}B$, and with unity feedback this yields a transfer function from $u_f$ to $u$ given by $1/(1+G_{loop})$. In this case, $G_{loop}$ is not $-K(sI - (A-BK))^{-1}B$, but rather the open loop system whose transfer function from $u_f$ to $-Kx$ is $G(s) = -K(sI - A)^{-1}B$. With negative feedback, the transfer function is $1/(1+G(s))$. With positive feedback $u=u_f-Kx$, the transfer from $u_f$ to $u$ is $1/(1+K(sI-A)^{-1}B)$. The term $1 - K(sI - A + BK)^{-1}B$ is precisely this sensitivity function.\n\nSubstituting this identity into our expression for $H(s)$:\n$$\nH(s) = -C(s) \\frac{1}{1 + K(sI-A)^{-1}B}\n$$\nFinally, we substitute the definition of the filter $C(s) = \\frac{\\omega_c}{s+\\omega_c}$:\n$$\nH(s) = - \\left( \\frac{\\omega_{c}}{s+\\omega_{c}} \\right) \\frac{1}{1 + K(sI-A)^{-1}B} = \\frac{-\\omega_{c}}{(s+\\omega_{c})\\left(1 + K(sI-A)^{-1}B\\right)}\n$$\nThis is the required transfer function from the uncertainty estimate $\\hat{\\sigma}(t)$ to the control signal $u(t)$.\n\nNow, we explain how this architecture enforces bandwidth separation. The derived transfer function $H(s)$ represents the \"actuation channel\" from the estimation block to the actuator. It is a cascade of two main components: the low-pass filter $-C(s)$ and the input sensitivity function of the baseline loop, $S_I(s) = (1 + K(sI-A)^{-1}B)^{-1}$.\n\nThe filter $C(s) = \\frac{\\omega_c}{s+\\omega_c}$ is a first-order low-pass filter with a cutoff frequency, or bandwidth, of $\\omega_c$ rad/s. For frequencies $\\omega \\gg \\omega_c$, the magnitude of the filter response $|C(j\\omega)|$ attenuates at a rate of $-20$ dB/decade.\n\nThe term $S_I(s)$ is related to the baseline closed-loop system, whose dynamics are governed by the matrix $A-BK$. Since $A-BK$ is Hurwitz, this baseline system is stable and possesses a certain bandwidth, say $\\omega_{cl}$, which is determined by the placement of the eigenvalues of $A-BK$.\n\nThe principle of $\\mathcal{L}_1$ adaptive control is to select the filter bandwidth $\\omega_c$ to be much smaller than the bandwidth $\\omega_{cl}$ of the baseline robust controller. By choosing $\\omega_c \\ll \\omega_{cl}$, the filter $C(s)$ becomes the dominant factor limiting the bandwidth of the overall transfer function $H(s)$. Consequently, any signal passing through this channel, specifically the estimate $\\hat{\\sigma}(t)$, is heavily attenuated at frequencies above $\\omega_c$. This ensures that the adaptive component $u_f(t)$ is a \"slow\" signal relative to the dynamics of the baseline closed-loop system.\n\nThis \"bandwidth separation\" is crucial for robustness. The fast, high-bandwidth baseline controller ($u_b = -Kx$) handles the primary stabilization and performance objectives. The slow, low-bandwidth adaptive loop ($u_f$) compensates for low-frequency uncertainties and disturbances without interfering with the high-frequency behavior of the system, where modeling errors are often largest and could otherwise lead to instability. The derived expression for $H(s)$ explicitly shows that the filter $C(s)$ is in series with the rest of the actuation channel, thereby enforcing this low-pass characteristic on any signal originating from the adaptive estimator.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\frac{-\\omega_{c}}{(s+\\omega_{c})\\left(1 + K(sI - A)^{-1}B\\right)}}\n$$", "id": "2716520"}, {"introduction": "This final exercise addresses a subtle but critical aspect of controller design: the choice of the low-pass filter.

Calculation of $\\mathcal{L}_1$ Norms**\n\nThe $\\mathcal{L}_1$ norm of a transfer function $H(s)$ is the integral of the absolute value of its impulse response $h(t)$.\n$\\lVert H \\rVert_{\\mathcal{L}_1} = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} |h(t)| \\, \\mathrm{d}t$.\nIf the impulse response $h(t)$ is non-negative for all $t \\ge 0$, then the $\\mathcal{L}_1$ norm is simply the integral of $h(t)$, which by the final value theorem's dual for initial conditions is equal to the DC gain $H(0)$.\n$\\lVert H \\rVert_{\\mathcal{L}_1} = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} h(t) \\, \\mathrm{d}t = H(s)|_{s=0} = H(0)$.\n\n**For $C_{1}(s)$:**\nThe transfer function is $C_{1}(s) = \\dfrac{\\omega_{c}}{s+\\omega_{c}}$. The corresponding impulse response is found by the inverse Laplace transform:\n$$c_{1}(t) = \\mathcal{L}^{-1}\\left\\{\\dfrac{\\omega_{c}}{s+\\omega_{c}}\\right\\}(t) = \\omega_{c} e^{-\\omega_{c} t} u(t)$$\nwhere $u(t)$ is the Heaviside step function. Since $\\omega_{c} > 0$, the impulse response $c_{1}(t)$ is non-negative for all $t \\ge 0$. Therefore, its $\\mathcal{L}_1$ norm is equal to its DC gain.\n$$ \\lVert C_{1} \\rVert_{\\mathcal{L}_1} = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} |\\omega_{c} e^{-\\omega_{c} t}| \\, \\mathrm{d}t = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\omega_{c} e^{-\\omega_{c} t} \\, \\mathrm{d}t = C_{1}(0) = \\dfrac{\\omega_{c}}{0+\\omega_{c}} = 1 $$\nThus, $\\lVert C_{1} \\rVert_{\\mathcal{L}_1} = 1$.\n\n**For $C_{2}(s)$:**\nThe transfer function is $C_{2}(s) = \\dfrac{\\omega_{c}^{2}}{s^{2} + \\sqrt{2}\\,\\omega_{c}\\,s + \\omega_{c}^{2}}$. This is a standard second-order system with natural frequency $\\omega_n = \\omega_c$ and damping ratio $\\zeta = 1/\\sqrt{2}$. Since $0 < \\zeta < 1$, the system is underdamped. The impulse response is:\n$$c_{2}(t) = \\mathcal{L}^{-1}\\{C_{2}(s)\\}(t) = \\frac{\\omega_n}{\\sqrt{1-\\zeta^2}} e^{-\\zeta\\omega_n t} \\sin(\\omega_d t) u(t)$$\nwhere $\\omega_d = \\omega_n \\sqrt{1-\\zeta^2}$. Substituting $\\omega_n = \\omega_c$ and $\\zeta=1/\\sqrt{2}$:\n$\\omega_d = \\omega_c \\sqrt{1 - (1/\\sqrt{2})^2} = \\omega_c \\sqrt{1/2} = \\omega_c/\\sqrt{2}$.\nThe pre-factor is $\\frac{\\omega_c}{\\sqrt{1/2}} = \\sqrt{2}\\omega_c$.\nSo, the impulse response is:\n$$c_{2}(t) = \\sqrt{2} \\omega_{c} e^{-\\frac{\\omega_{c}}{\\sqrt{2}}t} \\sin\\left(\\frac{\\omega_{c}}{\\sqrt{2}}t\\right) u(t)$$\nDue to the $\\sin(\\cdot)$ term, $c_{2}(t)$ is not non-negative for all $t \\ge 0$. It oscillates. Therefore, its $\\mathcal{L}_1$ norm will be strictly greater than the absolute value of its DC gain:\n$$ \\lVert C_{2} \\rVert_{\\mathcal{L}_1} = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} |c_{2}(t)| \\, \\mathrm{d}t > \\left| \\int_{0}^{\\infty} c_{2}(t) \\, \\mathrm{d}t \\right| = |C_{2}(0)| = 1 $$\nThe exact value of the integral is a known result for a second-order system with $\\zeta = 1/\\sqrt{2}$:\n$$ \\lVert C_{2} \\rVert_{\\mathcal{L}_1} = \\coth\\left(\\frac{\\pi\\zeta}{2\\sqrt{1-\\zeta^2}}\\right) = \\coth\\left(\\frac{\\pi (1/\\sqrt{2})}{2\\sqrt{1-(1/\\sqrt{2})^2}}\\right) = \\coth\\left(\\frac{\\pi/\\sqrt{2}}{2(1/\\sqrt{2})}\\right) = \\coth\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\right) $$\nNumerically, $\\coth(\\pi/2) = \\dfrac{e^{\\pi/2} + e^{-\\pi/2}}{e^{\\pi/2} - e^{-\\pi/2}} \\approx \\dfrac{4.8105 + 0.2079}{4.8105 - 0.2079} \\approx 1.09034$.\nSo, we have $\\lVert C_{1} \\rVert_{\\mathcal{L}_1} = 1$ and $\\lVert C_{2} \\rVert_{\\mathcal{L}_1} \\approx 1.0904$.\n\n**2. Comparison of Phase Lags**\n\nThe phase lag of a transfer function $H(s)$ at frequency $\\omega$ is given by $\\angle H(\\mathrm{j}\\omega)$.\n\n**For $C_{1}(s)$:**\n$C_{1}(\\mathrm{j}\\omega) = \\dfrac{\\omega_{c}}{\\mathrm{j}\\omega+\\omega_{c}}$.\nThe phase is $\\angle C_{1}(\\mathrm{j}\\omega) = -\\arctan(\\omega/\\omega_{c})$.\nAt the cutoff frequency $\\omega = \\omega_{c}$:\n$$\\angle C_{1}(\\mathrm{j}\\omega_{c}) = -\\arctan(\\omega_{c}/\\omega_{c}) = -\\arctan(1) = -\\frac{\\pi}{4} \\text{ rad}$$\n\n**For $C_{2}(s)$:**\n$C_{2}(\\mathrm{j}\\omega) = \\dfrac{\\omega_{c}^{2}}{(\\mathrm{j}\\omega)^{2} + \\sqrt{2}\\,\\omega_{c}(\\mathrm{j}\\omega) + \\omega_{c}^{2}} = \\dfrac{\\omega_{c}^{2}}{(\\omega_{c}^{2} - \\omega^2) + \\mathrm{j}\\sqrt{2}\\omega_{c}\\omega}$.\nThe phase is $\\angle C_{2}(\\mathrm{j}\\omega) = -\\arctan\\left(\\dfrac{\\sqrt{2}\\omega_{c}\\omega}{\\omega_{c}^{2} - \\omega^2}\\right)$.\nAt the cutoff frequency $\\omega = \\omega_{c}$, the real part of the denominator becomes zero:\n$$C_{2}(\\mathrm{j}\\omega_{c}) = \\dfrac{\\omega_{c}^{2}}{0 + \\mathrm{j}\\sqrt{2}\\omega_{c}^{2}} = \\dfrac{1}{\\mathrm{j}\\sqrt{2}} = -\\frac{\\mathrm{j}}{\\sqrt{2}}$$\nThe phase of this complex number is:\n$$\\angle C_{2}(\\mathrm{j}\\omega_{c}) = -\\frac{\\pi}{2} \\text{ rad}$$\nComparing the phase lags at $\\omega = \\omega_c$, the lag from $C_{2}(s)$ ($|-\\pi/2| = \\pi/2$) is greater than the lag from $C_{1}(s)$ ($|-\\pi/4| = \\pi/4$).\n\n**3. Comparison of Robustness Margins**\n\nThe problem states that the robustness margin $\\bar{L}$ is inversely proportional to $\\lVert C \\rVert_{\\mathcal{L}_1}$.\nWe have found that $\\lVert C_{1} \\rVert_{\\mathcal{L}_1} = 1$ and $\\lVert C_{2} \\rVert_{\\mathcal{L}_1} \\approx 1.0904$.\nSince $\\lVert C_{1} \\rVert_{\\mathcal{L}_1} < \\lVert C_{2} \\rVert_{\\mathcal{L}_1}$, the design using the first-order filter $C_{1}(s)$ yields a larger small-gain robustness margin than the design using the second-order Butterworth filter $C_{2}(s)$.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. $\\,\\lVert C_{1} \\rVert_{\\mathcal{L}_1} = 1$ and $\\,\\lVert C_{2} \\rVert_{\\mathcal{L}_1} \\approx 1.0904 \\gt 1$; the Butterworth filter $C_{2}$ exhibits larger phase lag near $\\omega \\approx \\omega_{c}$ (e.g., $\\angle C_{1}(\\mathrm{j}\\omega_{c}) = -\\pi/4$ versus $\\angle C_{2}(\\mathrm{j}\\omega_{c}) = -\\pi/2$); therefore, for the same architecture and uncertainty scaling, the first-order $C_{1}$ yields a larger small-gain robustness margin.**\n- The $\\mathcal{L}_1$ norms are correct as derived: $\\lVert C_{1} \\rVert_{\\mathcal{L}_1} = 1$ and $\\lVert C_{2} \\rVert_{\\mathcal{L}_1} \\approx 1.0904$.\n- The phase lag comparison is correct: At $\\omega = \\omega_c$, $\\angle C_{2}$ is $-\\pi/2$, which is a larger lag than $\\angle C_{1}$'s $-\\pi/4$.\n- The conclusion about the robustness margin is correct: A smaller $\\mathcal{L}_1$ norm implies a larger margin, so $C_{1}$ is superior in this regard.\nThis statement is fully consistent with our derivations.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. $\\,\\lVert C_{1} \\rVert_{\\mathcal{L}_1} = \\lVert C_{2} \\rVert_{\\mathcal{L}_1}$ because both have the same DC gain; the Butterworth $C_{2}$ yields less phase lag in the passband due to maximal flatness; consequently, both designs have the same robustness margin.**\n- `$\\lVert C_{1} \\rVert_{\\mathcal{L}_1} = \\lVert C_{2} \\rVert_{\\mathcal{L}_1}$`: Incorrect. We found $1 \\neq 1.0904$. The reason given, \"because both have the same DC gain\", is a logical fallacy; the $\\mathcal{L}_1$ norm equals the DC gain only for systems with non-negative impulse responses.\n- `less phase lag`: Incorrect. At $\\omega_c$, $C_2$ has more phase lag. The \"maximal flatness\" of a Butterworth filter applies to the magnitude response at $\\omega=0$, not the phase response across the passband.\n- `same robustness margin`: Incorrect, as it follows from the incorrect premise about the norms.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. The Butterworth $C_{2}$ has a smaller $\\mathcal{L}_1$ norm than $C_{1}$ because its roll-off is steeper, so it provides a larger robustness margin; it only incurs more phase lag well above $\\omega_{c}$, but not near $\\omega_{c}$.**\n- `$C_{2}$ has a smaller $\\mathcal{L}_1$ norm than $C_{1}$`: Incorrect. It is larger.\n- The reasoning \"because its roll-off is steeper\" is also flawed; steeper roll-off is often associated with time-domain ringing, which increases the $\\mathcal{L}_1$ norm.\n- `provides a larger robustness margin`: Incorrect.\n- `only incurs more phase lag well above $\\omega_{c}$`: Incorrect. It has significantly more phase lag at $\\omega_{c}$.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. The first-order $C_{1}$ has a larger $\\mathcal{L}_1$ norm than $C_{2}$; at $\\omega=\\omega_{c}$ the Butterworth $C_{2}$ actually has less phase lag; thus the robustness margin is larger for $C_{2}$.**\n- `$C_{1}$ has a larger $\\mathcal{L}_1$ norm than $C_{2}$`: Incorrect. It is smaller.\n- `$C_{2}$ actually has less phase lag`: Incorrect. It has more phase lag.\n- `robustness margin is larger for $C_{2}$`: Incorrect.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2716610"}]}
