It is a standard problem in the analysis of linear iterative systems, common in control theory, specifically in the study of ILC and RC. The model $e_{k+1} = \\mathcal{L}\\, e_{k}$ with the condition $\\|\\mathcal{L}\\| < 1$ is the canonical form for demonstrating linear convergence. The problem is scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and contains sufficient information for a unique solution. There are no contradictions, no reliance on pseudoscience, and no ambiguities. The problem is therefore deemed valid and a solution will be provided.\n\nThe task is to derive an inequality for the number of trials $k$ required to achieve an error norm reduction of at least a factor of $\\epsilon$, and then to compute this minimal integer $k$ for the given parameters.\n\nWe begin with the error propagation dynamics:\n$$\ne_{k+1} = \\mathcal{L}\\, e_{k}\n$$\nwhere $k$ is the trial index. We take the vector norm of both sides of this equation:\n$$\n\\|e_{k+1}\\| = \\|\\mathcal{L}\\, e_{k}\\|\n$$\nThe problem specifies that the norm is an induced norm. A fundamental property of an induced norm is its submultiplicativity, which states that for a linear operator $\\mathcal{L}$ and a vector $e_k$, the inequality $\\|\\mathcal{L}\\, e_k\\| \\leq \\|\\mathcal{L}\\| \\|e_k\\|$ holds. Applying this property, we get:\n$$\n\\|e_{k+1}\\| \\leq \\|\\mathcal{L}\\| \\|e_k\\|\n$$\nWe are given that $\\|\\mathcal{L}\\| \\leq \\gamma$. Substituting this into the inequality yields the fundamental recursive relationship for the error norm:\n$$\n\\|e_{k+1}\\| \\leq \\gamma \\|e_k\\|\n$$\nThis inequality relates the error norm at trial $k+1$ to the error norm at trial $k$. We can unroll this recursion to establish a relationship between the error at trial $k$ and the initial error at trial $0$, namely $\\|e_0\\|$.\n\nFor $k=1$:\n$$\n\\|e_1\\| \\leq \\gamma \\|e_0\\|\n$$\nFor $k=2$:\n$$\n\\|e_2\\| \\leq \\gamma \\|e_1\\| \\leq \\gamma (\\gamma \\|e_0\\|) = \\gamma^2 \\|e_0\\|\n$$\nBy mathematical induction, we can prove the general relationship $\\|e_k\\| \\leq \\gamma^k \\|e_0\\|$ for any integer $k \\geq 1$.\nThe base case for $k=1$ is shown above.\nAssume the hypothesis is true for some integer $j \\geq 1$, i.e., $\\|e_j\\| \\leq \\gamma^j \\|e_0\\|$.\nThen for $j+1$, we have:\n$$\n\\|e_{j+1}\\| \\leq \\gamma \\|e_j\\| \\leq \\gamma (\\gamma^j \\|e_0\\|) = \\gamma^{j+1} \\|e_0\\|\n$$\nThe hypothesis holds for $j+1$. Thus, the inequality $\\|e_k\\| \\leq \\gamma^k \\|e_0\\|$ is proven for all $k \\geq 1$.\n\nThe problem asks for the number of trials $k$ required to reduce the error norm by a factor $\\epsilon$. This is equivalent to finding $k$ such that the ratio of the error norm at trial $k$ to the initial error norm is less than or equal to $\\epsilon$. Assuming a non-trivial initial error, i.e., $\\|e_0\\| > 0$, this condition is:\n$$\n\\frac{\\|e_k\\|}{\\|e_0\\|} \\leq \\epsilon\n$$\nFrom our derived inequality, we have $\\frac{\\|e_k\\|}{\\|e_0\\|} \\leq \\gamma^k$. Therefore, a sufficient condition to satisfy the error reduction requirement is:\n$$\n\\gamma^k \\leq \\epsilon\n$$\nThis is a key inequality relating $k$, $\\gamma$, and $\\epsilon$. To solve for $k$, we use the properties of logarithms. We take the natural logarithm of both sides:\n$$\n\\ln(\\gamma^k) \\leq \\ln(\\epsilon)\n$$\nUsing the logarithm power rule, $\\ln(a^b) = b \\ln(a)$, we obtain:\n$$\nk \\ln(\\gamma) \\leq \\ln(\\epsilon)\n$$\nTo isolate $k$, we must divide by $\\ln(\\gamma)$. It is given that $0 < \\gamma < 1$, which implies that $\\ln(\\gamma)$ is a negative number. Dividing an inequality by a negative number reverses the direction of the inequality sign.\n$$\nk \\geq \\frac{\\ln(\\epsilon)}{\\ln(\\gamma)}\n$$\nThis is the general inequality relating the number of trials $k$ to the convergence factor $\\gamma$ and the desired error reduction factor $\\epsilon$.\n\nWe now proceed to the second part of the problem: to calculate the smallest integer number of trials $k$ for the specific values $\\gamma = 0.83$ and $\\epsilon = 0.01$.\nSubstituting these values into the derived inequality:\n$$\nk \\geq \\frac{\\ln(0.01)}{\\ln(0.83)}\n$$\nThe values of the logarithms are:\n$$\n\\ln(0.01) = \\ln(10^{-2}) = -2 \\ln(10) \\approx -4.605170185988092\n$$\n$$\n\\ln(0.83) \\approx -0.186320953188556\n$$\nThe ratio is:\n$$\n\\frac{\\ln(0.01)}{\\ln(0.83)} \\approx \\frac{-4.605170185988092}{-0.186320953188556} \\approx 24.71618...\n$$\nSo, the condition on $k$ is:\n$$\nk \\geq 24.71618...\n$$\nThe problem demands the smallest integer $k$ that satisfies this condition. Since $k$ must be an integer, we must choose the smallest integer greater than or equal to $24.71618...$, which is $25$. This operation is mathematically equivalent to the ceiling function, $\\lceil 24.71618... \\rceil = 25$.\n\nTherefore, a minimum of $25$ trials is required to guarantee that the error norm is reduced by at least a factor of $0.01$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{25}\n$$", "id": "2714829"}, {"introduction": "To apply ILC to real-world, finite-duration tasks, we often represent the system's entire trial-by-trial dynamics using a single matrix equation, a technique known as \"lifting\".

Thus, the maximum is always given by the second row sum:\n$$\n\\|I - \\alpha G\\|_\\infty \\;=\\; |1 - \\alpha g_0| + |\\alpha| |g_1|.\n$$\nThe condition for monotonic convergence is therefore $|1 - \\alpha g_0| + |\\alpha| |g_1| < 1$.\n\n3.

The term is zero when $0.8 \\alpha = 1$, which corresponds to $\\alpha = 1 / 0.8 = 1.25$. We analyze two cases for $\\alpha > 0$.\nCase 1: $0 < \\alpha \\le 1.25$.\nIn this interval, $1 - 0.8 \\alpha \\ge 0$, so $|1 - 0.8 \\alpha| = 1 - 0.8 \\alpha$.

Therefore,\n$$\n\\alpha_\\star \\;=\\; \\sup \\left( 0, \\frac{20}{11} \\right) \\;=\\; \\frac{20}{11}.\n$$\n\n4. The analogous condition for monotonic convergence in the $\\ell_2$ sense is $\\| I - G L \\|_2 < 1$, where $\\| \\cdot \\|_2$ denotes the induced matrix $2$-norm (the spectral norm). For $L = \\alpha I$, this becomes $\\| I - \\alpha G \\|_2 < 1$. The induced $2$-norm of a matrix $A$ is its largest singular value, $\\sigma_{\\max}(A)$, which is the square root of the largest eigenvalue of $A^T A$. Thus, the condition is $\\sigma_{\\max}(I - \\alpha G) < 1$.\n\nThe relative conservativeness of the $\\ell_\\infty$ and $\\ell_2$ conditions depends on the specific matrix $G$. For any matrix $A \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n \\times n}$, the induced norms are related by inequalities such as $\\|A\\|_2 \\le \\sqrt{n} \\|A\\|_\\infty$ and $\\|A\\|_\\infty \\le \\sqrt{n} \\|A\\|_2$, but there is no universal ordering between $\\|A\\|_2$ and $\\|A\\|_\\infty$. One can be larger, smaller, or equal to the other depending on the structure of $A$. Consequently, for a given $G$ and $\\alpha$, it is possible to have $\\|I - \\alpha G\\|_\\infty < 1$ while $\\|I - \\alpha G\\|_2 \\ge 1$, which would mean the $\\ell_2$ condition is more conservative for that $\\alpha$. Conversely, it is also possible that $\\|I - \\alpha G\\|_2 < 1$ while $\\|I - \\alpha G\\|_\\infty \\ge 1$, meaning the $\\ell_\\infty$ condition is more conservative. The choice of norm dictates the shape and size of the set of gains $\\alpha$ that guarantee monotonic convergence, and neither the $\\ell_2$ nor the $\\ell_\\infty$ condition is universally less conservative than the other. The comparison depends entirely on the numerical properties of the matrix $I - \\alpha G$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\frac{20}{11}}\n$$", "id": "2714828"}, {"introduction": "For tasks that are periodic, such as tracking a repeating trajectory, a frequency-domain perspective offers powerful insights.

We can solve for $U_{\\infty}(\\exp(j\\omega_k))$:\n$$U_{\\infty}(\\exp(j\\omega_k)) = \\left( Q(\\exp(j\\omega_k)) - 1 \\right) U_{\\infty}(\\exp(j\\omega_k)) + R(\\exp(j\\omega_k))$$\n$$U_{\\infty}(\\exp(j\\omega_k)) - \\left( Q(\\exp(j\\omega_k)) - 1 \\right) U_{\\infty}(\\exp(j\\omega_k)) = R(\\exp(j\\omega_k))$$\n$$U_{\\infty}(\\exp(j\\omega_k)) \\left( 1 - Q(\\exp(j\\omega_k)) + 1 \\right) = R(\\exp(j\\omega_k))$$\n$$U_{\\infty}(\\exp(j\\omega_k)) = \\frac{R(\\exp(j\\omega_k))}{2 - Q(\\exp(j\\omega_k))}$$\nNow, we find the steady-state error spectrum, $E_{\\infty}(\\exp(j\\omega_k))$:\n$$E_{\\infty}(\\exp(j\\omega_k)) = R(\\exp(j\\omega_k)) - U_{\\infty}(\\exp(j\\omega_k))$$\n$$E_{\\infty}(\\exp(j\\omega_k)) = R(\\exp(j\\omega_k)) - \\frac{R(\\exp(j\\omega_k))}{2 - Q(\\exp(j\\omega_k))}$$\n$$E_{\\infty}(\\exp(j\\omega_k)) = R(\\exp(j\\omega_k)) \\left( 1 - \\frac{1}{2 - Q(\\exp(j\\omega_k))} \\right)$$\n$$E_{\\infty}(\\exp(j\\omega_k)) = R(\\exp(j\\omega_k)) \\left( \\frac{2 - Q(\\exp(j\\omega_k)) - 1}{2 - Q(\\exp(j\\omega_k))} \\right)$$\n$$E_{\\infty}(\\exp(j\\omega_k)) = R(\\exp(j\\omega_k)) \\left( \\frac{1 - Q(\\exp(j\\omega_k))}{2 - Q(\\exp(j\\omega_k))} \\right)$$\nThe harmonic-wise attenuation factor $A_k$ is defined as the ratio of the magnitudes of the steady-state error spectrum and the reference spectrum:\n$$A_k = \\frac{|E_{\\infty}(\\exp(j\\omega_k))|}{|R(\\exp(j\\omega_k))|} = \\left| \\frac{1 - Q(\\exp(j\\omega_k))}{2 - Q(\\exp(j\\omega_k))} \\right|$$\nThis expression quantifies the attenuation as a function of the filter's frequency response $Q(\\exp(j\\omega_k))$, as requested.\n\nNext, we substitute the specific learning filter $Q(z) = \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{4} z + \\frac{1}{4} z^{-1}$. Its frequency response at $\\omega_k$ is:\n$$Q(\\exp(j\\omega_k)) = \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{4} \\exp(j\\omega_k) + \\frac{1}{4} \\exp(-j\\omega_k)$$\nUsing Euler's identity $\\cos(\\theta) = \\frac{\\exp(j\\theta) + \\exp(-j\\theta)}{2}$, we get:\n$$Q(\\exp(j\\omega_k)) = \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{2} \\cos(\\omega_k)$$\nSince $\\omega_k$ is a real frequency, $\\cos(\\omega_k)$ is real and ranges from $-1$ to $1$. Thus, $Q(\\exp(j\\omega_k))$ is a real value in the range $[0, 1]$. Let $Q_k = Q(\\exp(j\\omega_k))$.\nSince $0 \\le Q_k \\le 1$, the numerator of the attenuation expression, $1 - Q_k$, is non-negative ($0 \\le 1-Q_k \\le 1$). The denominator, $2 - Q_k$, is strictly positive ($1 \\le 2-Q_k \\le 2$). Therefore, the absolute value is not necessary:\n$$A_k = \\frac{1 - Q_k}{2 - Q_k} = \\frac{1 - \\left(\\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{2}\\cos(\\omega_k)\\right)}{2 - \\left(\\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{2}\\cos(\\omega_k)\\right)} = \\frac{\\frac{1}{2} - \\frac{1}{2}\\cos(\\omega_k)}{\\frac{3}{2} - \\frac{1}{2}\\cos(\\omega_k)} = \\frac{1 - \\cos(\\omega_k)}{3 - \\cos(\\omega_k)}$$\nTo obtain a more simplified form, we use the half-angle trigonometric identity $1 - \\cos(\\theta) = 2\\sin^{2}(\\theta/2)$.\nThe numerator becomes:\n$$1 - \\cos(\\omega_k) = 2\\sin^{2}\\left(\\frac{\\omega_k}{2}\\right)$$\nThe denominator becomes:\n$$3 - \\cos(\\omega_k) = 3 - \\left(1 - 2\\sin^{2}\\left(\\frac{\\omega_k}{2}\\right)\\right) = 2 + 2\\sin^{2}\\left(\\frac{\\omega_k}{2}\\right) = 2\\left(1 + \\sin^{2}\\left(\\frac{\\omega_k}{2}\\right)\\right)$$\nSubstituting these into the expression for $A_k$:\n$$A_k = \\frac{2\\sin^{2}\\left(\\frac{\\omega_k}{2}\\right)}{2\\left(1 + \\sin^{2}\\left(\\frac{\\omega_k}{2}\\right)\\right)} = \\frac{\\sin^{2}\\left(\\frac{\\omega_k}{2}\\right)}{1 + \\sin^{2}\\left(\\frac{\\omega_k}{2}\\right)}$$\nFinally, we substitute $\\omega_k = \\frac{2\\pi k}{N}$, which gives $\\frac{\\omega_k}{2} = \\frac{\\pi k}{N}$. The final expression for the attenuation factor $A_k$ as a function of $k$ and $N$ is:\n$$A_k = \\frac{\\sin^{2}\\left(\\frac{\\pi k}{N}\\right)}{1 + \\sin^{2}\\left(\\frac{\\pi k}{N}\\right)}$$\nThis is the required closed-form expression.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{\\sin^{2}\\left(\\frac{\\pi k}{N}\\right)}{1 + \\sin^{2}\\left(\\frac{\\pi k}{N}\\right)}}$$", "id": "2714809"}]}
