Let $U(\\omega)$ and $Y(\\omega)$ be the Fourier transforms of $u(t)$ and $y(t)$, respectively. The convolution theorem states that $Y(\\omega) = G(j\\omega) U(\\omega)$, where $G(j\\omega)$ is the frequency response of the system. This is valid because the system is stable, so the region of convergence of $G(s)$ includes the imaginary axis $s=j\\omega$.\n\nParseval's theorem relates the energy of a signal in the time domain to its energy in the frequency domain.

The supremum $M$ is achieved by concentrating the energy of the input signal $U(\\omega)$ at the frequency (or frequencies) where $|G(j\\omega)|$ attains its maximum.

Since $\\omega$ is a real frequency, we require $x \\ge 0$. We seek to maximize the function $h(x) = \\frac{1+x}{4+x^2}$ for $x \\ge 0$. We compute the derivative with respect to $x$ and set it to zero:\n$$ \\frac{dh}{dx} = \\frac{(1)(4+x^2) - (1+x)(2x)}{(4+x^2)^2} = \\frac{4+x^2 - 2x - 2x^2}{(4+x^2)^2} = \\frac{-x^2 - 2x + 4}{(4+x^2)^2} $$\nThe critical points occur when the numerator is zero: $-x^2 - 2x + 4 = 0$, or $x^2 + 2x - 4 = 0$.\nUsing the quadratic formula, the roots are:\n$$ x = \\frac{-2 \\pm \\sqrt{2^2 - 4(1)(-4)}}{2} = \\frac{-2 \\pm \\sqrt{20}}{2} = -1 \\pm \\sqrt{5} $$\nSince $x=\\omega^2$ must be non-negative, we select the positive root $x = \\sqrt{5} - 1$. The second derivative test or analysis of the sign of the first derivative confirms this is a maximum.\nThe maximum value of $|G(j\\omega)|^2$ is $h(\\sqrt{5}-1)$:\n$$ \\max |G(j\\omega)|^2 = h(\\sqrt{5}-1) = \\frac{1 + (\\sqrt{5}-1)}{4 + (\\sqrt{5}-1)^2} = \\frac{\\sqrt{5}}{4 + (5 - 2\\sqrt{5} + 1)} = \\frac{\\sqrt{5}}{10 - 2\\sqrt{5}} $$\nTo simplify this expression, we rationalize the denominator:\n$$ \\frac{\\sqrt{5}}{10 - 2\\sqrt{5}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{5}(10 + 2\\sqrt{5})}{(10 - 2\\sqrt{5})(10 + 2\\sqrt{5})} = \\frac{10\\sqrt{5} + 2(5)}{100 - 4(5)} = \\frac{10\\sqrt{5} + 10}{80} = \\frac{10(\\sqrt{5} + 1)}{80} = \\frac{1+\\sqrt{5}}{8} $$\nThe induced $L_2$ gain is the square root of this value:\n$$ \\|G\\|_{\\infty} = \\sqrt{\\frac{1+\\sqrt{5}}{8}} $$\nThis is the exact, closed-form analytic expression for the gain.\n\nRegarding the influence of the right-half-plane (RHP) zero at $s=1$:\nThe magnitude squared of the frequency response depends on the term $|j\\omega - 1|^2 = \\omega^2 + 1$. A zero in the left-half-plane at $s=-1$ would have yielded the term $|j\\omega - (-1)|^2 = |j\\omega + 1|^2 = \\omega^2 + 1$. The magnitude response is therefore identical and is unaffected by the location of the zero in the RHP versus the LHP. The effect of the zero *itself*, as opposed to no zero, is to provide the numerator term $1+\\omega^2$, which causes the gain to increase from its DC value of $|G(0)| = 1/2$ before the dominant $\\omega^4$ term in the denominator forces the gain to roll off at high frequencies. This creates a resonant peak at a non-zero frequency $\\omega_p = \\sqrt{\\sqrt{5}-1}$. A system without the zero, such as $G(s) = 1/(s^2+2s+2)$, would have a monotonically decreasing gain for $\\omega > 0$. The RHP location of the zero primarily affects the phase response, creating a non-minimum phase system, which has important consequences for feedback control design that are not captured by gain analysis alone.\n\nThe interaction with the small gain theorem is direct. The theorem guarantees stability of a feedback interconnection of two stable systems $G_1$ and $G_2$ if the loop gain is less than unity, i.e., $\\|G_1\\|_\\infty \\|G_2\\|_\\infty < 1$. In a robust stability context, if our plant is $G(s)$ and it is in a feedback loop with an uncertain stable dynamic block $\\Delta(s)$, stability is guaranteed if $\\|\\Delta\\|_\\infty < 1/\\|G\\|_\\infty$. In our case, $\\|G\\|_\\infty = \\sqrt{(1+\\sqrt{5})/8} \\approx 0.636$. The DC gain is $|G(0)| = 1/2 = 0.5$. The RHP zero is responsible for creating a gain peak which is higher than the DC gain. Therefore, the small gain theorem imposes a more restrictive constraint on the size of allowable uncertainty $\\|\\Delta\\|_\\infty < 1/0.636 \\approx 1.57$ than one might erroneously conclude by only inspecting the DC gain, which would suggest stability for $\\|\\Delta\\|_\\infty < 1/0.5 = 2$. The peak gain, located at a non-zero frequency, is the critical quantity for robust stability analysis via the small gain theorem.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\sqrt{\\frac{1+\\sqrt{5}}{8}}}$$", "id": "2712539"}, {"introduction": "While calculating the $\\|G\\|_{\\infty}$ norm analytically is possible for simple models, in practice we often deal with complex systems or experimental data.

The result of this process is $\\max_{\\omega \\in \\Omega_g} |G(\\mathrm{j}\\omega)|$.

If the chosen frequency grid $\\Omega_g$ is coarse, it is highly probable that no grid point will land on or very near the actual peak frequency. The grid points may fall on the \"skirts\" of the resonance curve, where the magnitude is significantly lower than the peak value. In this problem, the maximum magnitude found on the grid $\\Omega_g=\\{6, 8, 12, 14\\}$ is $5.144$ at $\\omega = 8$ rad/s. A resonance is suggested near $\\omega_n=10$ rad/s, a frequency not included in the grid and located in the grid's largest interval, between $8$ and $12$ rad/s.

The fundamental principle of the steady-state response of an LTI system to a sinusoidal input is that the output is also a sinusoid of the same frequency, with its amplitude scaled by the magnitude of the frequency response at that frequency.

The problem provides data from such an experiment conducted at $\\omega_0 = 10$ rad/s, with input amplitude $A_u = 0.157$ and measured output amplitude $A_y = 0.8732$.

So, $a-c = 1$.\n$$\ne^{A_{\\kappa}t} = \\begin{pmatrix} e^{-t} & \\kappa \\frac{e^{-t}-e^{-2t}}{1} \\\\ 0 & e^{-2t} \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} e^{-t} & \\kappa(e^{-t}-e^{-2t}) \\\\ 0 & e^{-2t} \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe state response is then:\n$$\nx(t) = e^{A_{\\kappa}t} B = \\begin{pmatrix} e^{-t} & \\kappa(e^{-t}-e^{-2t}) \\\\ 0 & e^{-2t} \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\kappa(e^{-t}-e^{-2t}) \\\\ e^{-2t} \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe first component of the state vector is $x_1(t) = \\kappa(e^{-t}-e^{-2t})$.\n\nWe must find the peak magnitude of this response, $\\sup_{t \\ge 0} |x_1(t)|$.\nSince $\\kappa>0$ and for $t>0$ we have $e^{-t} > e^{-2t}$, the function $x_1(t)$ is positive. We can maximize $x_1(t)$ by finding the critical points. At $t=0$, $x_1(0)=0$. As $t \\to \\infty$, $x_1(t) \\to 0$. We compute the derivative with respect to time:\n$$\n\\frac{d x_1}{dt} = \\frac{d}{dt} \\left[ \\kappa(e^{-t}-e^{-2t}) \\right] = \\kappa(-e^{-t} + 2e^{-2t})\n$$\nSetting the derivative to zero to find the maximum:\n$$\n\\kappa(-e^{-t} + 2e^{-2t}) = 0 \\quad \\implies \\quad 2e^{-2t} = e^{-t}\n$$\nDividing by $e^{-2t}$ (which is never zero), we get $2=e^t$, which implies $t = \\ln(2)$.\nWe evaluate $x_1(t)$ at this time to find the peak value:\n$$\nx_1(\\ln(2)) = \\kappa(e^{-\\ln(2)} - e^{-2\\ln(2)}) = \\kappa(e^{\\ln(1/2)} - e^{\\ln(1/4)}) = \\kappa\\left(\\frac{1}{2} - \\frac{1}{4}\\right) = \\frac{\\kappa}{4}\n$$\nThus, the peak magnitude is $\\sup_{t \\ge 0} |x_{1}(t)| = \\frac{\\kappa}{4}$.\n\nFinally, we compute the ratio $R(\\kappa)$:\n$$\nR(\\kappa) \\;:=\\; \\frac{\\sup_{t \\ge 0} |x_{1}(t)|}{\\|G_{\\kappa}\\|_{\\infty}}\n$$\nSubstituting the values we have computed:\n$$\nR(\\kappa) = \\frac{\\frac{\\kappa}{4}}{\\frac{1}{3}} = \\frac{3\\kappa}{4}\n$$\nThis result demonstrates that although the input-output gain is constant, the peak internal state response grows linearly with the parameter $\\kappa$, a classic sign of a nonnormal system exhibiting transient growth.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{3\\kappa}{4}}$$", "id": "2712529"}]}
