Stable spiral\n\nD. Unstable spiral\n\nE. Saddle point\n\nF. Center", "solution": "To classify the stability of the fixed point, we first need to find its coordinates. A fixed point $(V_0, W_0)$ of the system is a point where the derivatives are zero: $\\frac{dV}{dt} = 0$ and $\\frac{dW}{dt} = 0$.\n\nLet's set up the equations for the fixed point using the given parameter values: $a = 0.1$, $b = 0.01$, $c = 0.02$, and $I = 0$.\n\nThe system of equations becomes:\n1) $V(V-0.1)(1-V) - W = 0$\n2) $0.01V - 0.02W = 0$\n\nFrom a purely algebraic standpoint, we observe that one fixed point exists at $(V_0, W_0) = (0,0)$. We must verify that it is the unique fixed point. From the second equation, we can express $W$ in terms of $V$:\n$0.02W = 0.01V \\implies W = \\frac{0.01}{0.02}V = 0.5V$\n\nSubstitute this expression for $W$ into the first equation:\n$V(V-0.1)(1-V) - 0.5V = 0$\n\nWe can factor out a $V$ from this equation:\n$V \\left[ (V-0.1)(1-V) - 0.5 \\right] = 0$\n\nThis gives one solution at $V=0$. If $V=0$, then $W = 0.5(0) = 0$. So, $(V_0, W_0) = (0,0)$ is indeed a fixed point.\n\nThe other potential solutions come from the term in the brackets:\n$(V-0.1)(1-V) - 0.5 = 0$\n$V - V^2 - 0.1 + 0.1V - 0.5 = 0$\n$-V^2 + 1.1V - 0.6 = 0$\n$V^2 - 1.1V + 0.6 = 0$\n\nTo find the roots of this quadratic equation, we can use the quadratic formula, $V = \\frac{-B \\pm \\sqrt{B^2 - 4AC}}{2A}$, where $A=1$, $B=-1.1$, and $C=0.6$. The discriminant is $D = B^2 - 4AC$:\n$D = (-1.1)^2 - 4(1)(0.6) = 1.21 - 2.4 = -1.19$\n\nSince the discriminant is negative ($D < 0$), there are no real solutions for $V$ from this quadratic equation. Therefore, the only real fixed point for the system is $(V_0, W_0) = (0,0)$.\n\nNext, we analyze the stability of this fixed point by linearizing the system. We compute the Jacobian matrix, $J$, of the system:\n$J(V,W) = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial V} & \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial W} \\\\ \\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial V} & \\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial W} \\end{pmatrix}$\nwhere $f(V,W) = V(V-a)(1-V) - W + I = -V^3 + (1+a)V^2 - aV - W + I$ and $g(V,W) = bV - cW$.\n\nThe partial derivatives are:\n$\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial V} = -3V^2 + 2(1+a)V - a$\n$\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial W} = -1$\n$\\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial V} = b$\n$\\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial W} = -c$\n\nSo, the Jacobian matrix is:\n$J(V,W) = \\begin{pmatrix} -3V^2 + 2(1+a)V - a & -1 \\\\ b & -c \\end{pmatrix}$\n\nNow, we evaluate this matrix at the fixed point $(0,0)$ with the given parameter values: $a=0.1$, $b=0.01$, $c=0.02$.\n$J(0,0) = \\begin{pmatrix} -3(0)^2 + 2(1+0.1)(0) - 0.1 & -1 \\\\ 0.01 & -0.02 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} -0.1 & -1 \\\\ 0.01 & -0.02 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\nThe stability of the fixed point is determined by the eigenvalues of this matrix, which can be inferred from its trace ($\\tau$) and determinant ($\\Delta$).\n$\\tau = \\text{Tr}(J) = -0.1 + (-0.02) = -0.12$\n$\\Delta = \\det(J) = (-0.1)(-0.02) - (-1)(0.01) = 0.002 + 0.01 = 0.012$\n\nThe classification rules based on $\\tau$ and $\\Delta$ are:\n1.  If $\\Delta < 0$, the fixed point is a saddle point.\n2.  If $\\Delta > 0$ and $\\tau > 0$, the fixed point is unstable (unstable node or spiral).\n3.  If $\\Delta > 0$ and $\\tau < 0$, the fixed point is stable (stable node or spiral).\n4.  If $\\tau = 0$ and $\\Delta > 0$, the fixed point is a center.\n\nIn our case, $\\tau = -0.12 < 0$ and $\\Delta = 0.012 > 0$. This means the fixed point is stable. To distinguish between a stable node and a stable spiral, we examine the discriminant of the characteristic equation, $\\tau^2 - 4\\Delta$:\n$\\tau^2 - 4\\Delta = (-0.12)^2 - 4(0.012) = 0.0144 - 0.048 = -0.0336$\n\nSince $\\tau^2 - 4\\Delta < 0$, the eigenvalues of the Jacobian matrix are complex conjugates. A stable fixed point with complex eigenvalues corresponds to a stable spiral. The trajectories in the phase plane will spiral inwards towards the fixed point at the origin.\n\nTherefore, the resting state fixed point is a stable spiral.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1458306"}, {"introduction": "Real-world systems are rarely static; their qualitative behavior can change dramatically as underlying parameters are varied.
