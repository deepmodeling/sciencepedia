The problem is a standard exercise in nonlinear control theory, covering the circle criterion and the describing function method, and all provided data and conditions are scientifically sound, consistent, and sufficient for a unique solution under a standard convention.\n\n**Part 1: Analysis using the Circle Criterion**\n\nThe system consists of a linear time-invariant (LTI) plant $G(s)$ and a static nonlinearity $\\varphi(e)$ in a unity negative feedback loop. The nonlinearity $\\varphi(e)$ is a symmetric saturation function, which has a slope of $1$ for $|e|  M$ and $0$ for $|e|  M$. The function value $\\varphi(e)$ divided by its input $e$ is always in the range $[0, 1]$. Thus, the nonlinearity belongs to the sector $[k_1, k_2] = [0, 1]$.\n\nThe circle criterion for absolute stability of a system with a sector-bounded nonlinearity in $[k_1, k_2]=[0,1]$ requires that the Nyquist plot of the LTI element, $G(j\\omega)$, for $\\omega \\in (0, \\infty)$, must not enter the exclusion region. For the sector $[0, 1]$, this exclusion region is the half-plane to the left of the vertical line $\\text{Re}(z) = -1/k_2 = -1$.

The input amplitude is never large enough to cause saturation. Thus, $\\varphi(e) = e$, and $\\varphi(A\\sin\\theta) = A\\sin\\theta$.\n$$\nN(A) = \\frac{1}{\\pi A} \\int_0^{2\\pi} (A\\sin\\theta)\\sin\\theta \\, d\\theta = \\frac{1}{\\pi} \\int_0^{2\\pi} \\sin^2\\theta \\, d\\theta = \\frac{1}{\\pi} \\left[ \\frac{\\theta}{2} - \\frac{\\sin(2\\theta)}{4} \\right]_0^{2\\pi} = 1\n$$\n\nCase 2: $A > M$.

This imposes two conditions:\n1. Phase condition: $\\angle G(j\\omega^\\star) = -\\pi$.\n2. Magnitude condition: $|G(j\\omega^\\star)| = 1/N(A^\\star)$.\n\nFrom Part 1, we know that for the case $K=2\\omega_p$, the phase condition is met at a unique frequency $\\omega^\\star = \\omega_p$.\nAt this frequency, we also found that $|G(j\\omega_p)|=|-1|=1$.\n\nSubstituting these into the magnitude condition:\n$$\n1 = \\frac{1}{N(A^\\star)} \\implies N(A^\\star) = 1\n$$\nWe now consult the expression for $N(A)$ from Part 2 to find the amplitude $A^\\star$ for which $N(A^\\star)=1$.\nFrom the derivation, we found that $N(A)=1$ for all amplitudes $A \\le M$. For $A>M$, the function $N(A)$ is strictly decreasing from $1$ towards $0$.\nTherefore, the condition $N(A^\\star)=1$ is satisfied for any amplitude $A^\\star$ in the interval $(0, M]$.\n\nThis result indicates a neutrally stable family of oscillations. The linear system with gain $K=2\\omega_p$ is marginally stable with poles at $\\pm j\\omega_p$. Any oscillation with amplitude up to $M$ behaves as a purely linear phenomenon. A limit cycle, in the context of nonlinear dynamics, is typically understood as an oscillation whose amplitude is determined and stabilized by the nonlinearity. The smallest amplitude at which the nonlinearity is engaged is $A=M$. For any amplitude greater than this, the effective gain $N(A)$ would drop below $1$, damping the oscillation. Therefore, the sustained oscillation is predicted at the boundary of the linear region. We select the maximal amplitude from the valid range.\n\nThus, the predicted amplitude is $A^\\star = M$.\nThe predicted oscillation frequency is $\\omega^\\star = \\omega_p$.\nThe result is the pair $(A^\\star, \\omega^\\star)$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix} M  \\omega_{p} \\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "2731651"}, {"introduction": "Beyond analytical techniques for continuous-time systems, the computational exploration of discrete-time maps offers a window into more complex phenomena like frequency locking and chaos.

The width of the widest accepted plateau as a real number rounded to $4$ decimal places.\n\nFinal Output Format.\nYour program should produce a single line of output containing the results for the four test cases as a comma-separated list of lists enclosed in square brackets. Each inner list corresponds to one test case in the order above and must have the form $[\\text{count},\\text{bool},\\text{width}]$, for example:\n$[[3,True,0.1250],[\\dots],[\\dots],[\\dots]]$.\nNo units are involved in this problem. Angles inside the sine function are in radians by definition of the map. All floating-point outputs must be rounded to $4$ decimal places as specified above before printing.", "solution": "The problem requires a numerical investigation of the standard circle map, a fundamental model in the study of nonlinear dynamical systems and frequency-locking phenomena. The objective is to approximate the rotation number $\\rho(K,\\Omega)$ across a grid of forcing frequencies $\\Omega$ for several values of the nonlinearity parameter $K$, and to identify and characterize the frequency-locked plateaus, known as Arnold tongues.\n\nThe solution is constructed by directly implementing the procedures specified in the problem statement. The methodology follows a hierarchical structure based on first principles.\n\nAt the core of the analysis is the rotation number, defined as $\\rho = \\lim_{n\\to\\infty} (x_n - x_0)/n$. This quantity measures the average asymptotic rate of change of the system's phase. We are instructed to compute a numerical approximation, $\\widehat{\\rho}$, by iterating the lifted map:\n$$\nx_{k+1} = x_k + \\Omega - \\frac{K}{2\\pi}\\sin(2\\pi x_k)\n$$\nThe calculation for each pair $(K, \\Omega)$ begins with $x_0 = 0$. The first $N_{\\mathrm{tr}} = 1500$ iterations are discarded as a transient phase to ensure the system has settled onto its attractor. The subsequent $N_{\\mathrm{avg}} = 3000$ iterations are used to compute the average frequency:\n$$\n\\widehat{\\rho}(K,\\Omega) = \\frac{x_{N_{\\mathrm{tr}}+N_{\\mathrm{avg}}} - x_{N_{\\mathrm{tr}}}}{N_{\\mathrm{avg}}}\n$$\nThis procedure is systematically applied to every point on a uniform grid of $N_{\\Omega} = 401$ values of $\\Omega$ in the interval $[0,1]$ for each specified test case $K$.\n\nOnce $\\widehat{\\rho}$ is computed for a given $\\Omega$, the next step is to test for frequency locking. This is a classification task. A point is deemed locked if its numerically computed rotation number is sufficiently close to a simple rational number. This is implemented via a two-step process:\n1.  **Best Rational Approximation**: For each $\\widehat{\\rho}$, we find the best rational approximation $p/q$ where the denominator $q$ does not exceed a maximum value, $q_{\\max} = 8$. This is accomplished algorithmically using the method of continued fractions, which is efficiently implemented in standard libraries.\n2.  **Locking Condition**: The point $(\\Omega, \\widehat{\\rho})$ is classified as locked with rational number $p/q$ if the absolute difference between the computed rotation number and its rational approximation is within a specified tolerance:\n    $$\n    \\left| \\widehat{\\rho}(K,\\Omega) - \\frac{p}{q} \\right| \\le \\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{lock}}\n    $$\n    where $\\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{lock}} = 5 \\times 10^{-4}$. If this condition is met, the state is labeled with the pair $(p,q)$; otherwise, it is considered unlocked.\n\nAfter all points on the $\\Omega$-grid for a given $K$ have been classified, the resulting sequence of labels is scanned to identify plateaus. A plateau is defined as a contiguous sub-sequence of grid points that are all locked to the identical rational number $(p,q)$.\n\nEach identified potential plateau is then subjected to validation criteria to filter out spurious or insignificant results. A segment is accepted as a valid plateau only if it satisfies both of the following conditions:\n- It must comprise at least $m_{\\min} = 3$ consecutive grid points.\n- The span of the $\\Omega$ values in the segment, defined as $\\Omega_{\\max} - \\Omega_{\\min}$ for that segment, must be at least $w_{\\min} = 0.01$.\n\nFinally, for each value of $K$, the set of accepted plateaus is analyzed to extract the required summary metrics:\n1.  The total count of accepted plateaus.\n2.  A Boolean flag indicating whether a plateau corresponding to the $1:2$ frequency lock ($\\rho = 1/2$) is present in the accepted set.\n3.  The width of the widest plateau found, rounded to four decimal places. For the case of no accepted plateaus, this width is reported as $0$.\n\nThis entire computational procedure is encapsulated in a program that iterates through the four specified values of $K$, performs the analysis for each, and formats the final results into a single line of output as required. The case $K=0$ serves as a baseline, where the map is linear ($x_{k+1} = x_k + \\Omega$) and thus $\\rho=\\Omega$. In this linear case, true plateaus cannot form, and the specified validation criteria correctly filter out any artifacts from the rational approximation process, as expected. For $K>0$, the nonlinearity induces true frequency-locking, and the algorithm is designed to detect and measure the resulting plateaus.", "answer": "```python\n# The complete and runnable Python 3 code goes here.\n# Imports must adhere to the specified execution environment.\nimport numpy as np\nfrom fractions import Fraction\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves the circle map problem by numerically approximating rotation numbers,\n    detecting frequency-locked plateaus, and reporting statistics for several\n    nonlinearity parameters K.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define the fixed numerical settings from the problem statement.\n    N_TR = 1500\n    N_AVG = 3000\n    EPS_LOCK = 5e-4\n    M_MIN = 3\n    X0 = 0.0\n\n    # Define the test cases from the problem statement.\n    test_cases = [\n        # (K, Omega_min, Omega_max, N_Omega, q_max, w_min)\n        (0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 401, 8, 0.01),\n        (0.5, 0.0, 1.0, 401, 8, 0.01),\n        (1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 401, 8, 0.01),\n        (1.2, 0.0, 1.0, 401, 8, 0.01),\n    ]\n\n    all_case_results = []\n    for K, omega_min, omega_max, n_omega, q_max, w_min in test_cases:\n        # Create the grid of Omega values.\n        omega_grid = np.linspace(omega_min, omega_max, n_omega)\n        locked_states = []\n\n        # Pre-compute the K-dependent term for efficiency.\n        k_term = K / (2 * np.pi)\n\n        # Iterate over each Omega to compute rho_hat and determine its locked state.\n        for omega in omega_grid:\n            x = X0\n            \n            # 1.
