We are given a candidate function $V(x, y) = \\frac{1}{2}x^2 + \\frac{1}{2}y^2$ to aid the analysis. This suggests using an argument based on Lyapunov theory, specifically the LaSalle Invariance Principle, to determine the global asymptotic behavior of the system.\n\nFirst, let's analyze the properties of the function $V(x, y)$.\n$V(x, y) = \\frac{1}{2}(x^2 + y^2)$ is positive for all $(x, y) \\neq (0, 0)$, and $V(0, 0) = 0$. Thus, $V(x, y)$ is a positive definite function. Furthermore, as $\\|(x,y)\\| \\to \\infty$, $V(x,y) \\to \\infty$, so the function is radially unbounded. This will ensure that all trajectories are bounded.\n\nThe core of the analysis lies in computing the time derivative of $V(x, y)$ along the trajectories of the system. Using the chain rule, the time derivative $\\dot{V}$ is given by:\n$$ \\dot{V}(x, y) = \\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial x}\\dot{x} + \\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial y}\\dot{y} $$\nThe partial derivatives of $V$ are:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial x} = x $$\n$$ \\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial y} = y $$\nSubstituting these and the expressions for $\\dot{x}$ and $\\dot{y}$ from the system definition:\n$$ \\dot{V}(x, y) = (x)(\\dot{x}) + (y)(\\dot{y}) = x(y) + y(-x - y^3) $$\nSimplifying the expression for $\\dot{V}$:\n$$ \\dot{V}(x, y) = xy - xy - y^4 = -y^4 $$\nSince $y^4 \\ge 0$ for any real number $y$, its negative, $-y^4$, must be less than or equal to zero.\n$$ \\dot{V}(x, y) = -y^4 \\le 0 $$\nThis shows that $\\dot{V}$ is a negative semi-definite function. The function $V(x,y)$ is non-increasing along any trajectory of the system. Since $V$ is also radially unbounded, this implies that all trajectories are bounded and must approach a limit set.\n\nAccording to the LaSalle Invariance Principle, any bounded trajectory will converge to the largest invariant set, let's call it $M$, which is contained within the set $E$ where $\\dot{V}(x,y) = 0$.\n\nFirst, we identify the set $E$:\n$$ E = \\{ (x, y) \\in \\mathbb{R}^2 \\mid \\dot{V}(x, y) = 0 \\} $$\nFrom our calculation, $\\dot{V}(x, y) = -y^4$. So, $\\dot{V} = 0$ implies $-y^4 = 0$, which means $y = 0$.\nThus, the set $E$ is the x-axis:\n$$ E = \\{ (x, y) \\in \\mathbb{R}^2 \\mid y = 0 \\} $$\n\nNext, we identify the largest invariant set $M$ within $E$. A set is invariant if any trajectory starting in the set remains in the set for all future times. For a trajectory to stay within $E$, it must always satisfy $y(t) = 0$. If $y(t)=0$ for all $t$ along a trajectory, then its derivative $\\dot{y}(t)$ must also be zero for all $t$.\nLet's examine the system's dynamics on the set $E$ (where $y=0$):\n$$ \\dot{x} = y = 0 $$\n$$ \\dot{y} = -x - y^3 = -x - 0^3 = -x $$\nFor a trajectory to remain in $E$, we must have $\\dot{y} = 0$. From the dynamics on $E$, this requires $-x = 0$, which implies $x = 0$.\nTherefore, the only point in $E$ for which a trajectory can stay in $E$ is the point where $x=0$ and $y=0$. Any trajectory starting at a point $(x_0, 0)$ with $x_0 \\neq 0$ will have $\\dot{y} = -x_0 \\neq 0$, causing it to immediately leave the set $E$.\nThe largest invariant set $M$ contained in $E$ is thus the single point at the origin:\n$$ M = \\{ (0, 0) \\} $$\n\nBy the LaSalle Invariance Principle, since all trajectories are bounded, they must all converge to the largest invariant set $M$.\nTherefore, every trajectory of the system converges to the point $(0, 0)$ as $t \\to \\infty$.\nThe coordinates of the limit point are $(x^*, y^*) = (0, 0)$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}}$$", "id": "1689524"}, {"introduction": "Building upon the foundational method, this next exercise introduces a system with a more nuanced damping mechanism.
