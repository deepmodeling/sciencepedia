The analysis will be conducted by examining the properties of the explicit solution to the differential equation, as permitted by the instructions.\n\nFirst, we derive the closed-form solution for an initial condition $x(0) = x_0$. For $x_0 \\neq 0$, the equation is separable:\n$$\n\\frac{dx}{x^3} = -dt\n$$\nIntegrating both sides from the initial state $(0, x_0)$ to a state $(t, x(t))$:\n$$\n\\int_{x_0}^{x(t)} \\xi^{-3} d\\xi = \\int_{0}^{t} -1 d\\tau\n$$\n$$\n\\left[ -\\frac{1}{2\\xi^2} \\right]_{x_0}^{x(t)} = -t\n$$\n$$\n-\\frac{1}{2x(t)^2} + \\frac{1}{2x_0^2} = -t\n$$\nRearranging for $x(t)^2$:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{2x(t)^2} = t + \\frac{1}{2x_0^2} = \\frac{2tx_0^2 + 1}{2x_0^2}\n$$\n$$\nx(t)^2 = \\frac{x_0^2}{1 + 2tx_0^2}\n$$\nSince the solution $x(t)$ must have the same sign as the initial condition $x_0$ (because $\\dot{x}$ has the opposite sign of $x$, the trajectory cannot cross the origin), we take the square root preserving the sign:\n$$\nx(t) = \\frac{x_0}{\\sqrt{1 + 2tx_0^2}}\n$$\nThis solution is valid for all $t \\ge 0$ as the denominator is always positive. If $x_0=0$, the solution is trivially $x(t)=0$ for all $t \\ge 0$.\n\nWe now examine each stability property based on its formal definition.\n\n1.  **Lyapunov Stability ($s$)**: The equilibrium $x^{\\ast}=0$ is Lyapunov stable if for every $\\epsilon > 0$, there exists a $\\delta = \\delta(\\epsilon) > 0$ such that if $|x_0 - x^{\\ast}| < \\delta$, then $|x(t) - x^{\\ast}| < \\epsilon$ for all $t \\ge 0$.\n    For our system, this means if $|x_0| < \\delta$, then $|x(t)| < \\epsilon$ for all $t \\ge 0$.\n    From the solution, we can analyze its magnitude:\n    $$\n    |x(t)| = \\frac{|x_0|}{\\sqrt{1 + 2tx_0^2}}\n    $$\n    For any $t \\ge 0$ and any $x_0 \\in \\mathbb{R}$, the term in the denominator satisfies $\\sqrt{1 + 2tx_0^2} \\ge \\sqrt{1} = 1$.\n    Therefore, for all $t \\ge 0$, we have the inequality:\n    $$\n    |x(t)| \\le |x_0|\n    $$\n    Given any $\\epsilon > 0$, we can choose $\\delta = \\epsilon$. If an initial condition satisfies $|x_0| < \\delta = \\epsilon$, it follows directly that $|x(t)| \\le |x_0| < \\epsilon$ for all $t \\ge 0$. The condition for Lyapunov stability is satisfied. Thus, $s=1$.\n\n2.  **Asymptotic Stability ($a$)**: The equilibrium $x^{\\ast}=0$ is asymptotically stable if it is Lyapunov stable and attractive. Attractivity requires that there exists a $\\delta_{attr} > 0$ such that if $|x_0 - x^{\\ast}| < \\delta_{attr}$, then $\\lim_{t \\to \\infty} x(t) = x^{\\ast}$.\n    We have already established Lyapunov stability. We now check for attractivity. We compute the limit of the solution as $t \\to \\infty$:\n    $$\n    \\lim_{t \\to \\infty} x(t) = \\lim_{t \\to \\infty} \\frac{x_0}{\\sqrt{1 + 2tx_0^2}}\n    $$\n    For any $x_0 \\neq 0$, the denominator $\\sqrt{1+2tx_0^2}$ grows without bound as $t \\to \\infty$. Consequently, the fraction approaches zero. For $x_0=0$, the limit is trivially $0$.\n    $$\n    \\lim_{t \\to \\infty} x(t) = 0\n    $$\n    This convergence to the origin occurs for any initial condition $x_0 \\in \\mathbb{R}$. We can therefore choose any $\\delta_{attr} > 0$. The equilibrium is attractive.\n    Since the equilibrium is both Lyapunov stable and attractive, it is asymptotically stable. Thus, $a=1$.\n\n3.  **Exponential Stability ($e$)**: The equilibrium $x^{\\ast}=0$ is exponentially stable if it is asymptotically stable and there exist constants $\\alpha > 0$, $\\lambda > 0$, and $\\delta_{exp} > 0$ such that for any initial condition satisfying $|x_0 - x^{\\ast}| < \\delta_{exp}$, the solution satisfies $|x(t) - x^{\\ast}| \\le \\alpha |x_0 - x^{\\ast}| \\exp(-\\lambda t)$ for all $t \\ge 0$.\n    For our system, this translates to finding $\\alpha > 0$, $\\lambda > 0$, $\\delta_{exp} > 0$ such that for all $|x_0| < \\delta_{exp}$:\n    $$\n    |x(t)| \\le \\alpha |x_0| \\exp(-\\lambda t)\n    $$\n    Substituting the solution $|x(t)| = |x_0| / \\sqrt{1 + 2tx_0^2}$:\n    $$\n    \\frac{|x_0|}{\\sqrt{1 + 2tx_0^2}} \\le \\alpha |x_0| \\exp(-\\lambda t)\n    $$\n    For $x_0 \\neq 0$, we can divide by $|x_0|$:\n    $$\n    \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 + 2tx_0^2}} \\le \\alpha \\exp(-\\lambda t)\n    $$\n    $$\n    \\exp(\\lambda t) \\le \\alpha \\sqrt{1 + 2tx_0^2}\n    $$\n    To establish a contradiction, let us assume such positive constants $\\alpha, \\lambda, \\delta_{exp}$ exist. Choose a fixed initial condition $x_0$ such that $0 < |x_0| < \\delta_{exp}$. The inequality must hold for this $x_0$ for all $t \\ge 0$. Let us examine the behavior of both sides as $t \\to \\infty$. The left side, $\\exp(\\lambda t)$, grows exponentially. The right side, $\\alpha \\sqrt{1 + 2tx_0^2}$, grows proportionally to $\\sqrt{t}$. An exponential function will always eventually dominate a square-root function.\n    Formally, consider the limit of the ratio:\n    $$\n    \\lim_{t \\to \\infty} \\frac{\\alpha \\sqrt{1 + 2tx_0^2}}{\\exp(\\lambda t)} = 0\n    $$\n    This implies that for any sufficiently large $t$, $\\exp(\\lambda t) > \\alpha \\sqrt{1 + 2tx_0^2}$, which contradicts the inequality required for exponential stability. The rate of convergence to the origin is algebraic, not exponential. Therefore, the equilibrium is not exponentially stable. Thus, $e=0$.\n\n4.  **Global Asymptotic Stability (GAS) ($g$)**: The equilibrium $x^{\\ast}=0$ is globally asymptotically stable if it is Lyapunov stable and globally attractive. Global attractivity means that for any initial condition $x_0$ in the entire state space (here, $\\mathbb{R}$), the solution converges to the equilibrium: $\\lim_{t \\to \\infty} x(t) = x^{\\ast}$.\n    We have already established Lyapunov stability. In our analysis for asymptotic stability, we demonstrated that $\\lim_{t \\to \\infty} x(t) = 0$ for *any* initial condition $x_0 \\in \\mathbb{R}$. This is precisely the definition of global attractivity.\n    Since the equilibrium is Lyapunov stable and globally attractive, it is globally asymptotically stable. Thus, $g=1$.\n\nThe conclusions for each property are:\n-   Lyapunov stability ($s$): Holds. $s=1$.\n-   Asymptotic stability ($a$): Holds. $a=1$.\n-   Exponential stability ($e$): Does not hold. $e=0$.\n-   Global asymptotic stability ($g$): Holds. $g=1$.\n\nThe resulting vector $\\begin{pmatrix} s & a & e & g \\end{pmatrix}$ is $\\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1 & 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1 & 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}}\n$$", "id": "2722252"}, {"introduction": "Building on the foundational definitions, this exercise introduces the power of Lyapunov's second method, particularly through the lens of the Invariance Principle.

Lyapunov Stability Analysis**\n\nTo investigate the stability of the equilibrium at the origin $x=0$, we select a Lyapunov function candidate. A natural choice, motivated by the concept of energy in an analogous physical system (a simple harmonic oscillator), is the quadratic function $V(x) = x_1^2 + x_2^2$.\n\nFirst, it must be verified that this function $V: \\mathbb{R}^2 \\to \\mathbb{R}$ is continuously differentiable and positive definite.\n- The function $V(x) = x_1^2 + x_2^2$ is a polynomial in $x_1$ and $x_2$, so it is continuously differentiable everywhere on $\\mathbb{R}^2$.\n- At the origin, $V(0) = 0^2 + 0^2 = 0$.\n- For any $x \\neq 0$, at least one of its components, $x_1$ or $x_2$, is non-zero. Since the square of any non-zero real number is positive, $V(x) = x_1^2 + x_2^2 > 0$ for all $x \\neq 0$.\nThus, $V(x)$ is a valid positive definite function.\n\nNext, we compute the orbital derivative, $\\dot{V}(x)$, along the trajectories of the system. The orbital derivative is given by $\\dot{V}(x) = \\nabla V(x)^{\\top} f(x)$, where $f(x) = Ax$.\nThe gradient of $V(x)$ is $\\nabla V(x) = \\begin{bmatrix} 2x_1 \\\\ 2x_2 \\end{bmatrix}$.\nThe vector field is $f(x) = Ax = \\begin{bmatrix} \\omega x_2 \\\\ -\\omega x_1 \\end{bmatrix}$.\nThe orbital derivative is therefore:\n$$\n\\dot{V}(x) = \\begin{bmatrix} 2x_1 & 2x_2 \\end{bmatrix} \\begin{bmatrix} \\omega x_2 \\\\ -\\omega x_1 \\end{bmatrix} = (2x_1)(\\omega x_2) + (2x_2)(-\\omega x_1) = 2\\omega x_1 x_2 - 2\\omega x_1 x_2 = 0\n$$\nThe orbital derivative $\\dot{V}(x)$ is identically zero for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}^2$. This means that $V(x(t))$ is constant along any trajectory of the system. Specifically, $V(x(t)) = V(x(0))$ for all $t \\ge 0$. As $V(x) = \\|x\\|^2_2$, this implies that the Euclidean norm of the state vector is conserved: $\\|x(t)\\|_2 = \\|x(0)\\|_2$.\n\nWith this result, we can prove Lyapunov stability of the origin directly from the definition. The definition requires that for every $\\varepsilon > 0$, there exists a $\\delta > 0$ such that if $\\|x(0)\\|<\\delta$, then $\\|x(t)\\|<\\varepsilon$ for all $t \\ge 0$.\nLet an arbitrary $\\varepsilon > 0$ be given. We must find a suitable $\\delta$. Let us choose $\\delta = \\varepsilon$.\nIf an initial state $x(0)$ satisfies $\\|x(0)\\| < \\delta$, then by our choice of $\\delta$, $\\|x(0)\\| < \\varepsilon$.\nSince we have established that $\\|x(t)\\| = \\|x(0)\\|$ for all $t \\ge 0$, it follows immediately that $\\|x(t)\\| < \\varepsilon$ for all $t \\ge 0$.\nThis satisfies the definition of Lyapunov stability. Therefore, the origin is a stable equilibrium.\n\n**2. Asymptotic Stability and the LaSalle Invariance Principle**\n\nThe origin is asymptotically stable if it is Lyapunov stable and, in addition, trajectories starting sufficiently close to the origin converge to the origin as $t \\to \\infty$. We will use the LaSalle invariance principle to show this is not the case.\n\nThe principle is applied to a compact, forward-invariant set. Let us consider the closed ball of radius $R > 0$, defined as $K_R = \\{x \\in \\mathbb{R}^2 : \\|x\\| \\le R\\}$.\n- This set is compact.\n- It is forward-invariant because any trajectory starting in $K_R$ (i.e., $\\|x(0)\\| \\le R$) will satisfy $\\|x(t)\\| = \\|x(0)\\| \\le R$ for all $t \\ge 0$, and thus $x(t)$ remains in $K_R$.\n\nLet $E \\subseteq K_R$ be the set where $\\dot{V}(x) = 0$. Since we found $\\dot{V}(x) = 0$ for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}^2$, we have $E = K_R$.\nLaSalle's invariance principle states that any trajectory starting in $K_R$ must approach the largest invariant set $M$ contained in $E = K_R$.\n\nWe must characterize this set $M$. An invariant set is a union of complete trajectories. The trajectories of the system are the equilibrium point at the origin $\\{0\\}$ and circles of constant radius $c > 0$ centered at the origin, described by $\\{x \\in \\mathbb{R}^2 : \\|x\\| = c\\}$. The largest set composed of such trajectories that is contained within $K_R = \\{x:\\|x\\|\\le R\\}$ is $K_R$ itself. Thus, $M = K_R$.\n\nThe principle implies that trajectories starting in $K_R$ converge to the set $M=K_R$. This set $M=K_R$, for any $R>0$, contains infinite nontrivial periodic orbits, namely the circles $\\{x : \\|x\\| = c\\}$ for any $c \\in (0, R]$. For example, the boundary circle $\\{x : \\|x\\| = R\\}$ is a nontrivial periodic orbit within $M$.\n\nFor the origin to be asymptotically stable, any trajectory starting at $x(0)$ in a sufficiently small neighborhood of the origin must satisfy $\\lim_{t \\to \\infty} x(t) = 0$. This would imply that the largest invariant set contained in any sufficiently small neighborhood of the origin is just the singleton set $\\{0\\}$.\nHowever, our analysis shows that for any initial condition $x(0) \\neq 0$, the trajectory remains on the circle of radius $\\|x(0)\\| > 0$. The state vector $x(t)$ never approaches the origin. The limit set for such a trajectory is the circle $\\{x : \\|x\\| = \\|x(0)\\|\\}$, not the point $\\{0\\}$. This contradicts the condition for asymptotic stability.\nTherefore, the origin is not asymptotically stable, and by extension, it is not globally asymptotically stable (GAS).\n\n**3. Minimal Period of a Nontrivial Solution**\n\nWe are asked to find the minimal period $T$ of the solution corresponding to the initial condition $x(0) = \\begin{bmatrix} r \\\\ 0 \\end{bmatrix}$ with $r > 0$.\nThe system of differential equations is:\n$$\n\\dot{x}_1 = \\omega x_2\n$$\n$$\n\\dot{x}_2 = -\\omega x_1\n$$\nDifferentiating the first equation with respect to time gives $\\ddot{x}_1 = \\omega \\dot{x}_2$. Substituting the second equation yields $\\ddot{x}_1 = \\omega(-\\omega x_1) = -\\omega^2 x_1$. This is the equation of simple harmonic motion, $\\ddot{x}_1 + \\omega^2 x_1 = 0$.\nThe general solution for $x_1(t)$ is $x_1(t) = C_1 \\cos(\\omega t) + C_2 \\sin(\\omega t)$.\nFrom $\\dot{x}_1 = \\omega x_2$, we find $x_2(t) = \\frac{1}{\\omega} \\dot{x}_1(t) = -C_1 \\sin(\\omega t) + C_2 \\cos(\\omega t)$.\nWe apply the initial condition $x(0) = \\begin{bmatrix} r \\\\ 0 \\end{bmatrix}$ to find the constants $C_1$ and $C_2$.\nAt $t=0$:\n$x_1(0) = C_1 \\cos(0) + C_2 \\sin(0) = C_1 = r$.\n$x_2(0) = -C_1 \\sin(0) + C_2 \\cos(0) = C_2 = 0$.\nSo, the particular solution for the given initial condition is:\n$$\nx(t) = \\begin{bmatrix} x_1(t) \\\\ x_2(t) \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} r \\cos(\\omega t) \\\\ -r \\sin(\\omega t) \\end{bmatrix}\n$$\nThe state $x(t)$ is periodic. We seek the minimal positive period $T$ such that $x(t+T) = x(t)$ for all $t$. This requires:\n$$\n\\cos(\\omega(t+T)) = \\cos(\\omega t) \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\sin(\\omega(t+T)) = \\sin(\\omega t)\n$$\nThe fundamental period of the standard sine and cosine functions is $2\\pi$. For the above equalities to hold for all $t$, the argument of the functions must differ by an integer multiple of $2\\pi$. That is, $\\omega T = 2\\pi k$ for some non-zero integer $k$.\nThe minimal positive period $T$ corresponds to $k=1$.\n$$\n\\omega T = 2\\pi\n$$\nGiven that $\\omega > 0$, we can solve for $T$:\n$$\nT = \\frac{2\\pi}{\\omega}\n$$\nThis is the minimal positive period of the solution.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{2\\pi}{\\omega}}$$", "id": "2722281"}, {"introduction": "Our final practice transitions to a common scenario in control engineering: analyzing the local stability of a nonlinear system.

For this problem, the equilibrium point is the origin, $x_e = 0$.\n1.

The problem suggests the candidate Lyapunov function $V(x) = x_{1}^{2} + x_{2}^{2}$, where $x = (x_1, x_2)$. This function is continuously differentiable. It is also positive definite, as $V(0) = 0$ and $V(x) > 0$ for all $x \\ne 0$.\n\nWe compute the time derivative of $V(x)$ along the trajectories of the system using the chain rule, $\\dot{V}(x) = \\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial x_1}\\dot{x}_1 + \\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial x_2}\\dot{x}_2$.\nThe partial derivatives of $V(x)$ are $\\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial x_1} = 2x_1$ and $\\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial x_2} = 2x_2$.\nSubstituting the system dynamics, we obtain:\n$$\n\\dot{V}(x) = (2x_1)(-x_1 + x_2^2) + (2x_2)(-x_2) = -2x_1^2 + 2x_1 x_2^2 - 2x_2^2\n$$\nThis can be rewritten in terms of the Euclidean norm $\\|x\\| = \\sqrt{x_1^2 + x_2^2}$ as:\n$$\n\\dot{V}(x) = -2(x_1^2+x_2^2) + 2x_1 x_2^2 = -2\\|x\\|^2 + 2x_1 x_2^2\n$$\nTo establish local asymptotic stability, we must show that $\\dot{V}(x)$ is negative definite in some neighborhood of the origin. We can bound the term $2x_1 x_2^2$. Using the inequalities $|x_1| \\le \\|x\\|$ and $|x_2| \\le \\|x\\|$, we have $|2x_1 x_2^2| \\le 2|x_1|x_2^2 \\le 2\\|x\\|(\\|x\\|^2) = 2\\|x\\|^3$.\nThus, we can write an upper bound for $\\dot{V}(x)$:\n$$\n\\dot{V}(x) \\le -2\\|x\\|^2 + 2\\|x\\|^3 = -2\\|x\\|^2 (1 - \\|x\\|)\n$$\nFor any $x$ such that $0 < \\|x\\| < 1$, the term $(1 - \\|x\\|)$ is positive, which implies $\\dot{V}(x) < 0$.

By Lyapunov's theorem, since $V(x)$ is positive definite and $\\dot{V}(x)$ is negative definite in a neighborhood of the origin, the origin is a locally asymptotically stable equilibrium point.\n\nNow, we proceed to the specific task of finding the largest radius $r > 0$ such that the inequality $\\dot{V}(x) \\le -\\frac{1}{2}\\|x\\|^2$ holds for all $x$ in the closed ball $\\|x\\| \\le r$.\nThe inequality is:\n$$\n-2x_1^2 + 2x_1 x_2^2 - 2x_2^2 \\le -\\frac{1}{2}(x_1^2 + x_2^2)\n$$\nRearranging the terms to isolate the nonlinear part, we get:\n$$\n2x_1 x_2^2 \\le - \\frac{1}{2}(x_1^2 + x_2^2) + 2(x_1^2 + x_2^2) \\\\\n2x_1 x_2^2 \\le \\frac{3}{2}(x_1^2 + x_2^2)\n$$\nThis inequality must hold for all $x = (x_1, x_2)$ satisfying $x_1^2 + x_2^2 \\le r^2$.\nTo analyze this condition, we convert to polar coordinates, setting $x_1 = \\rho \\cos\\theta$ and $x_2 = \\rho \\sin\\theta$, where $\\rho = \\|x\\| \\ge 0$.\nSubstituting these into the inequality gives:\n$$\n2(\\rho \\cos\\theta)(\\rho^2 \\sin^2\\theta) \\le \\frac{3}{2}\\rho^2\n$$\nFor $\\rho = 0$, the inequality holds trivially ($0 \\le 0$). For $\\rho > 0$, we can divide both sides by $\\rho^2$:\n$$\n2\\rho \\cos\\theta \\sin^2\\theta \\le \\frac{3}{2}\n$$\nThis inequality must be satisfied for all $\\rho \\in (0, r]$ and for all $\\theta \\in [0, 2\\pi)$. For the inequality to hold over the entire disk of radius $r$, it must hold for the combination of $\\rho$ and $\\theta$ that maximizes the left-hand side.\nLet $L(\\rho, \\theta) = 2\\rho \\cos\\theta \\sin^2\\theta$. The term $\\cos\\theta \\sin^2\\theta$ can be positive. For any $\\theta$ where $\\cos\\theta \\sin^2\\theta > 0$, the function $L(\\rho, \\theta)$ is an increasing function of $\\rho$. Therefore, the maximum value of $L$ over the domain $\\rho \\in (0, r]$ will occur at $\\rho = r$.\nSo we must satisfy the condition:\n$$\n2r \\cos\\theta \\sin^2\\theta \\le \\frac{3}{2} \\quad \\text{for all } \\theta \\in [0, 2\\pi)\n$$\nThis is equivalent to requiring $2r \\cdot \\max_{\\theta} (\\cos\\theta \\sin^2\\theta) \\le \\frac{3}{2}$. Let us find the maximum value of the function $g(\\theta) = \\cos\\theta \\sin^2\\theta$.\nWe can write $g(\\theta) = \\cos\\theta(1 - \\cos^2\\theta)$. Let $u = \\cos\\theta$, so $u \\in [-1, 1]$. We want to maximize $h(u) = u(1-u^2) = u-u^3$.\nThe derivative is $h'(u) = 1 - 3u^2$. Setting $h'(u)=0$ yields $u^2 = \\frac{1}{3}$, so $u = \\pm \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}}$.\nWe evaluate $h(u)$ at these critical points and at the endpoints $u=\\pm 1$:\n$h(1/\\sqrt{3}) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}} - (\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}})^3 = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}} - \\frac{1}{3\\sqrt{3}} = \\frac{2}{3\\sqrt{3}}$.\n$h(-1/\\sqrt{3}) = -\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}} + \\frac{1}{3\\sqrt{3}} = -\\frac{2}{3\\sqrt{3}}$.\n$h(1)=0$, $h(-1)=0$.\nThe maximum value of $h(u)$ is $\\frac{2}{3\\sqrt{3}}$. Thus, $\\max_{\\theta} g(\\theta) = \\frac{2}{3\\sqrt{3}}$.\nSubstituting this maximum value back into our condition on $r$:\n$$\n2r \\left(\\frac{2}{3\\sqrt{3}}\\right) \\le \\frac{3}{2} \\\\\n\\frac{4r}{3\\sqrt{3}} \\le \\frac{3}{2}\n$$\nSolving for $r$, we find:\n$$\nr \\le \\frac{3}{2} \\cdot \\frac{3\\sqrt{3}}{4} = \\frac{9\\sqrt{3}}{8}\n$$\nThe problem asks for the largest value of $r$ for which the inequality holds. This corresponds to the upper bound of this range. Therefore, the maximal radius is $r = \\frac{9\\sqrt{3}}{8}$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{9\\sqrt{3}}{8}}$$", "id": "2722249"}]}
