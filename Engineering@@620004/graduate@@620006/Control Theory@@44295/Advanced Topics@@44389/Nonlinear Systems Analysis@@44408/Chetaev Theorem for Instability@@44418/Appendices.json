The system describes a linear saddle point, which is a textbook example of an unstable equilibrium. The problem is well-posed, asking for a constructive proof of this instability. The language is objective and mathematically precise. The setup is complete and free of contradictions. The problem does not violate any of the criteria for invalidity.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict**\nThe problem is valid. A solution will be provided.\n\n**Solution**\nLet the state vector be $x = \\begin{pmatrix} x_1 \\\\ x_2 \\end{pmatrix}$. The dynamics are governed by the linear system $\\dot{x} = Ax$, where $A = \\begin{pmatrix} 3  0 \\\\ 0  -1 \\end{pmatrix}$. The equilibrium point at the origin $x=0$ has one unstable eigenvalue $\\lambda_1 = 3$ and one stable eigenvalue $\\lambda_2 = -1$. We will prove instability using Chetaev's theorem.\n\nFirst, we derive the expression for the time derivative of the Chetaev function candidate, $V(x) = x^{\\top} P x$, where $P$ is a constant symmetric matrix. Applying the chain rule, the derivative of $V(x)$ along the system trajectories is:\n$$\n\\dot{V}(x) = \\frac{d}{dt}(x^{\\top} P x) = \\dot{x}^{\\top} P x + x^{\\top} P \\dot{x}\n$$\nSubstituting $\\dot{x} = Ax$:\n$$\n\\dot{V}(x) = (Ax)^{\\top} P x + x^{\\top} P (Ax) = x^{\\top} A^{\\top} P x + x^{\\top} P A x\n$$\nSince this is a scalar quantity, we can express it as a single quadratic form:\n$$\n\\dot{V}(x) = x^{\\top} (A^{\\top} P + PA) x\n$$\nThis is the general expression for $\\dot{V}(x)$. Let the symmetric matrix $P$ be $P = \\begin{pmatrix} p_{11}  p_{12} \\\\ p_{12}  p_{22} \\end{pmatrix}$. The matrix $A$ is given as $A = \\begin{pmatrix} 3  0 \\\\ 0  -1 \\end{pmatrix}$, which is symmetric, so $A^{\\top} = A$. We compute the matrix $Q = AP + PA$:\n$$\nAP = \\begin{pmatrix} 3  0 \\\\ 0  -1 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} p_{11}  p_{12} \\\\ p_{12}  p_{22} \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 3p_{11}  3p_{12} \\\\ -p_{12}  -p_{22} \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\n$$\nPA = \\begin{pmatrix} p_{11}  p_{12} \\\\ p_{12}  p_{22} \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} 3  0 \\\\ 0  -1 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 3p_{11}  -p_{12} \\\\ 3p_{12}  -p_{22} \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\n$$\nQ = AP + PA = \\begin{pmatrix} 6p_{11}  2p_{12} \\\\ 2p_{12}  -2p_{22} \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThus, $\\dot{V}(x) = x^{\\top}Qx = 6p_{11}x_1^2 + 4p_{12}x_1x_2 - 2p_{22}x_2^2$.\n\nNext, we select a simple symmetric matrix $P$ with integer entries. The instability is driven by the $x_1$ component, associated with the positive eigenvalue. A logical choice for $V(x)$ is a function that isolates this behavior. We choose:\n$$\nP = \\begin{pmatrix} 1  0 \\\\ 0  -1 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThis gives $p_{11} = 1$, $p_{12} = 0$, and $p_{22} = -1$. With this choice, the function $V(x)$ is:\n$$\nV(x) = x^{\\top} P x = \\begin{pmatrix} x_1  x_2 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} 1  0 \\\\ 0  -1 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} x_1 \\\\ x_2 \\end{pmatrix} = x_1^2 - x_2^2\n$$\nThe domain $D$ is defined by the condition $V(x)  0$. Analytically, this is the set:\n$$\nD = \\{ x \\in \\mathbb{R}^2 \\mid x_1^2 - x_2^2  0 \\}\n$$\nThis inequality is equivalent to $x_1^2  x_2^2$, or $|x_1|  |x_2|$. This describes an open, conic region in the plane that contains the $x_1$-axis and points arbitrarily close to the origin. The boundary of $D$ is defined by $V(x) = 0$, which gives $x_1^2 - x_2^2 = 0$. The equations for the boundary rays are therefore $x_2 = x_1$ and $x_2 = -x_1$. This corresponds to the form $x_2 = \\pm k x_1$ with the positive slope parameter $k=1$.\n\nFinally, we must verify that $\\dot{V}(x)  0$ for all $x \\in D \\setminus \\{0\\}$. We substitute the chosen values of $p_{11}$, $p_{12}$, and $p_{22}$ into our expression for $\\dot{V}(x)$:\n$$\n\\dot{V}(x) = 6(1)x_1^2 + 4(0)x_1x_2 - 2(-1)x_2^2 = 6x_1^2 + 2x_2^2\n$$\nThis quadratic form is a sum of squares with positive coefficients. It is positive definite, meaning $\\dot{V}(x)  0$ for any non-zero vector $x \\in \\mathbb{R}^2$. Consequently, this condition holds for all $x \\in D \\setminus \\{0\\}$, as required by Chetaev's theorem.\n\nThe construction is complete.

The problem is self-contained, providing all necessary definitions and data. It does not violate any fundamental principles, is not trivial, and is fully formalizable.\n\nStep 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is deemed valid. A complete solution will be provided.\n\nThe origin of the system $\\dot{x} = Ax$ is an equilibrium point since $A \\cdot 0 = 0$. We first analyze its stability by examining the eigenvalues of the matrix $A$. The characteristic equation is $\\det(A - \\lambda I) = 0$.\n$$\n\\det \\begin{pmatrix} -1 - \\lambda  10 \\\\ -10  -1 - \\lambda \\end{pmatrix} = (-1 - \\lambda)^2 - (10)(-10) = (\\lambda+1)^2 + 100 = 0\n$$\nThe eigenvalues are $\\lambda_{1,2} = -1 \\pm 10i$. Since the real parts of both eigenvalues are negative ($\\text{Re}(\\lambda_{1,2}) = -1  0$), the origin is an asymptotically stable equilibrium point. This immediately indicates that any application of an instability theorem must fail due to a violated hypothesis. We now follow the prescribed steps to construct the explicit counterexample.\n\n1. Definition of $V(x)$ and DOMAIN $D$\nGiven the vector $c = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}$, the candidate function $V(x)$ is a linear functional:\n$$\nV(x) = c^{\\top} x = \\begin{pmatrix} 1  0 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} x_1 \\\\ x_2 \\end{pmatrix} = x_1\n$$\nThe domain $D$ is defined by the set of inequalities $c^{\\top} x  0$ and $c^{\\top} A x \\ge 0$. The first inequality is $V(x) = x_1  0$. For the second inequality, we compute $c^{\\top} A x$:\n$$\nc^{\\top} A x = \\begin{pmatrix} 1  0 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} -1  10 \\\\ -10  -1 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} x_1 \\\\ x_2 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} -1  10 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} x_1 \\\\ x_2 \\end{pmatrix} = -x_1 + 10x_2\n$$\nSo the second condition is $-x_1 + 10x_2 \\ge 0$. The domain $D$ is therefore:\n$$\nD = \\{ x = (x_1, x_2) \\in \\mathbb{R}^{2} \\mid x_1  0 \\text{ and } -x_1 + 10x_2 \\ge 0 \\}\n$$\nThis can be written as $D = \\{ x \\in \\mathbb{R}^{2} \\mid x_1  0 \\text{ and } x_2 \\ge \\frac{1}{10}x_1 \\}$. This region is a cone-like sector in the plane.\n\n2. Verification of $V(x)  0$ on $D$\nBy the definition of the domain $D$, for any point $x = (x_1, x_2) \\in D$, the condition $x_1  0$ holds. Since $V(x) = x_1$, it follows directly that $V(x)  0$ for all $x \\in D$.\n\n3. Verification of $\\dot{V}(x) \\ge 0$ on $D$\nThe time derivative of $V(x)$ along the trajectories of the system is given by $\\dot{V}(x) = \\nabla V(x)^{\\top} \\dot{x} = \\nabla V(x)^{\\top} (A x)$. The gradient of $V(x) = x_1$ is:\n$$\n\\nabla V(x) = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial x_1} \\\\ \\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial x_2} \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix} = c\n$$\nThus, $\\dot{V}(x) = c^{\\top} A x$. From our calculation in step 1, this is $\\dot{V}(x) = -x_1 + 10x_2$. By the definition of the domain $D$, for any point $x \\in D$, the condition $-x_1 + 10x_2 \\ge 0$ holds. Therefore, $\\dot{V}(x) \\ge 0$ for all $x \\in D$.\n\n4. Analysis of the boundary condition\nThe boundary of the region $D$ near the origin, $\\partial D$, is formed by segments of two lines passing through the origin: $x_1 = 0$ and $-x_1 + 10x_2 = 0$.\nChetaev's theorem for instability requires that on the boundary of the region where $V(x)0$ (within some neighborhood of the origin), the function $V(x)$ must be identically zero.\nLet us examine the part of the boundary defined by the condition $c^{\\top} Ax = 0$, which is the line $-x_1 + 10x_2 = 0$, or $x_1 = 10x_2$. For points on this boundary segment near the origin, we must also satisfy the condition $x_1  0$ from the definition of $D$'s closure. If $x_1  0$, then $x_2 = x_1/10  0$.\nFor any such point $(x_1, x_2)$ on this boundary, the value of the function $V$ is $V(x_1, x_2) = x_1$. Since $x_1  0$, $V(x)$ is strictly positive, not zero. For example, the point $(\\epsilon, \\epsilon/10)$ for an arbitrarily small $\\epsilon  0$ lies on this boundary, and $V(\\epsilon, \\epsilon/10) = \\epsilon \\neq 0$.\nThis demonstrates that the crucial boundary condition of Chetaev's theorem is violated. The theorem requires that trajectories can only \"escape\" to larger values of $V$ and are \"fenced in\" by a boundary where $V=0$. Here, trajectories can leave the region $D$ through a boundary where $\\dot{V}=0$ but $V0$.\n\n5. Proof of Asymptotic Stability\nTo formally prove that the origin is asymptotically stable, we construct a strict quadratic Lyapunov function $W(x) = x^{\\top} P x$ where $P$ is a symmetric positive-definite matrix. The time derivative is $\\dot{W}(x) = x^{\\top} (A^{\\top}P + PA) x$. We must find a $P  0$ such that $A^{\\top}P + PA = -Q$ for some positive-definite matrix $Q$. This is the Lyapunov equation.\nLet us choose the simplest candidate $P = I = \\begin{pmatrix} 1  0 \\\\ 0  1 \\end{pmatrix}$, which is positive definite.\n$$\nA^{\\top}P + PA = A^{\\top}I + IA = A^{\\top} + A = \\begin{pmatrix} -1  -10 \\\\ 10  -1 \\end{pmatrix} + \\begin{pmatrix} -1  10 \\\\ -10  -1 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} -2  0 \\\\ 0  -2 \\end{pmatrix} = -2I\n$$\nWe have found that $A^{\\top}I + IA = -2I$. Let $Q=2I$. Since $Q$ is positive definite, our choice of $P=I$ is valid.\nThe Lyapunov function is $W(x) = x^{\\top} I x = x_1^2 + x_2^2$. This function is positive definite. Its time derivative along trajectories is:\n$$\n\\dot{W}(x) = x^{\\top}(-2I)x = -2(x_1^2 + x_2^2)\n$$\nThis derivative $\\dot{W}(x)$ is negative definite, as it is strictly negative for all $x \\ne 0$.\nBy the Lyapunov stability theorem, the existence of such a function $W(x)$ proves that the origin is globally asymptotically stable.\n\n6. Conclusion\nWe have constructed a function $V(x)=x_1$ and a domain $D$ where $V(x)0$ and $\\dot{V}(x) \\ge 0$. These are partial conditions for instability according to Chetaev's theorem. However, the system is demonstrably asymptotically stable. The conclusion of instability from Chetaev's theorem does not apply because a critical hypothesis is violated: the function $V(x)$ is not zero on the part of the boundary of $D$ where trajectories can exit the region where $\\dot{V}(x) \\ge 0$. This example rigorously illustrates that all conditions of a mathematical theorem must be satisfied; failure to meet even one, such as the boundary condition here, can completely invalidate its conclusion.\nThe explicit analytic expression for the function $V(x)$ constructed is $V(x_1, x_2) = x_1$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{V(x_1, x_2) = x_1}\n$$", "id": "2692659"}]}
