It presents a standard problem in the analysis of Input-to-State Stability (ISS) for a linear system. All necessary data and definitions are provided, and there are no contradictions or ambiguities. Therefore, the problem is deemed valid, and we shall proceed with a rigorous derivation.\n\nThe system is described by the scalar ordinary differential equation:\n$$\n\\dot{x}(t) = -\\alpha x(t) + \\beta (u(t) + d(t))\n$$\nwhere $\\alpha > 0$ and $\\beta > 0$ are constants. The candidate Lyapunov function is given as $V(x) = x^2$. We must derive an explicit class $\\mathcal{K}$ gain function $\\gamma$ for the ISS estimate.\n\nFirst, we compute the time derivative of $V(x)$ along the trajectories of the system:\n$$\n\\dot{V}(x(t)) = \\frac{dV}{dx} \\dot{x}(t) = 2x(t) \\left( -\\alpha x(t) + \\beta (u(t) + d(t)) \\right)\n$$\n$$\n\\dot{V}(t) = -2\\alpha x(t)^2 + 2\\beta x(t)(u(t) + d(t))\n$$\nTo establish an ISS dissipation inequality, we must bound the cross-term involving the state $x$ and the inputs $u, d$. We utilize Young's inequality, which states that for any real numbers $A$ and $B$, and any $\\delta > 0$, the inequality $2AB \\le \\delta A^2 + \\frac{1}{\\delta} B^2$ holds. We apply this to the second term:\n$$\n2\\beta x(t)(u(t) + d(t)) \\le |2\\beta x(t)(u(t) + d(t))| = 2\\beta |x(t)| |u(t) + d(t)|\n$$\nLet us apply Young's inequality with $A = |x(t)|$ and $B = \\beta|u(t)+d(t)|$. This gives:\n$$\n2\\beta |x(t)| |u(t)+d(t)| \\le \\delta x(t)^2 + \\frac{1}{\\delta} (\\beta|u(t)+d(t)|)^2 = \\delta x(t)^2 + \\frac{\\beta^2}{\\delta} (u(t)+d(t))^2\n$$\nSubstituting this back into the expression for $\\dot{V}(t)$:\n$$\n\\dot{V}(t) \\le -2\\alpha x(t)^2 + \\delta x(t)^2 + \\frac{\\beta^2}{\\delta} (u(t)+d(t))^2\n$$\n$$\n\\dot{V}(t) \\le -(2\\alpha - \\delta)x(t)^2 + \\frac{\\beta^2}{\\delta} (u(t)+d(t))^2\n$$\nTo ensure the coefficient of the $x(t)^2$ term is negative, we must choose $\\delta < 2\\alpha$. A judicious choice that simplifies the expression is to set the resulting coefficient equal to $-\\alpha$. This requires $2\\alpha - \\delta = \\alpha$, which implies $\\delta = \\alpha$. Since $\\alpha > 0$ is given, this is a valid choice.\n\nWith $\\delta = \\alpha$, the inequality for $\\dot{V}(t)$ becomes:\n$$\n\\dot{V}(t) \\le -\\alpha x(t)^2 + \\frac{\\beta^2}{\\alpha} (u(t)+d(t))^2\n$$\nRecognizing that $V(t) = x(t)^2$, we have the differential inequality:\n$$\n\\dot{V}(t) \\le -\\alpha V(t) + \\frac{\\beta^2}{\\alpha} (u(t)+d(t))^2\n$$\nThe problem specifies an ISS bound with respect to the input argument $s = \\sup_{0 \\le \\tau \\le t} |u(\\tau)| + \\bar{d}$. By the triangle inequality, we have $|u(\\tau) + d(\\tau)| \\le |u(\\tau)| + |d(\\tau)|$. Given the bounds $|d(\\tau)| \\le \\bar{d}$ and $|u(\\tau)| \\le \\sup_{0 \\le \\sigma \\le t} |u(\\sigma)|$, it follows that for any $\\tau \\in [0, t]$:\n$$\n|u(\\tau) + d(\\tau)| \\le \\sup_{0 \\le \\sigma \\le t} |u(\\sigma)| + \\bar{d} = s\n$$\nTherefore, $(u(\\tau)+d(\\tau))^2 \\le s^2$. We can thus write a simpler differential inequality:\n$$\n\\dot{V}(t) \\le -\\alpha V(t) + \\frac{\\beta^2}{\\alpha} s^2\n$$\nBy the comparison lemma for differential equations, the solution $V(t)$ is bounded by the solution of the corresponding linear ODE $\\dot{y}(t) = -\\alpha y(t) + \\frac{\\beta^2}{\\alpha} s^2$ with $y(0) = V(0)$. The solution is:\n$$\nV(t) \\le V(0) \\exp(-\\alpha t) + \\int_0^t \\exp(-\\alpha(t-\\tau)) \\frac{\\beta^2}{\\alpha} s^2 d\\tau\n$$\nEvaluating the integral:\n$$\n\\int_0^t \\exp(-\\alpha(t-\\tau)) d\\tau = \\left[ \\frac{1}{\\alpha} \\exp(-\\alpha(t-\\tau)) \\right]_{\\tau=0}^{\\tau=t} = \\frac{1}{\\alpha} (1 - \\exp(-\\alpha t))\n$$\nSubstituting this back, we obtain the bound on $V(t)$:\n$$\nV(t) \\le V(0) \\exp(-\\alpha t) + \\frac{\\beta^2}{\\alpha^2} s^2 (1 - \\exp(-\\alpha t))\n$$\nTo find the bound for $|x(t)| = \\sqrt{V(t)}$, we take the square root of both sides. Using the property that for non-negative $a,b$, $\\sqrt{a+b} \\le \\sqrt{a} + \\sqrt{b}$:\n$$\n|x(t)| \\le \\sqrt{V(0)\\exp(-\\alpha t)} + \\sqrt{\\frac{\\beta^2}{\\alpha^2} s^2 (1 - \\exp(-\\alpha t))}\n$$\nWith $V(0) = x(0)^2$, this simplifies to:\n$$\n|x(t)| \\le |x(0)|\\exp(-\\frac{\\alpha}{2}t) + \\frac{\\beta}{\\alpha} s \\sqrt{1 - \\exp(-\\alpha t)}\n$$\nThe problem requires an ISS estimate of the form $|x(t)| \\le \\beta_{\\mathcal{K}\\mathcal{L}}(|x(0)|, t) + \\gamma(s)$, where $\\gamma$ is a class $\\mathcal{K}$ function independent of time $t$. To achieve this, we bound the time-dependent factor $\\sqrt{1 - \\exp(-\\alpha t)}$. Since $\\alpha > 0$ and $t \\ge 0$, we have $0 \\le \\exp(-\\alpha t) \\le 1$, which implies $0 \\le \\sqrt{1 - \\exp(-\\alpha t)} \\le 1$.\nThis allows the final inequality:\n$$\n|x(t)| \\le |x(0)|\\exp(-\\frac{\\alpha}{2}t) + \\frac{\\beta}{\\alpha} s\n$$\nBy comparing this to the target ISS form, we identify the transient term $\\beta_{\\mathcal{K}\\mathcal{L}}(r,t) = r\\exp(-\\frac{\\alpha}{2}t)$ and the ISS gain term $\\gamma(s)$.\nThe function $\\gamma$ is given by:\n$$\n\\gamma(s) = \\frac{\\beta}{\\alpha} s\n$$\nThis function is of class $\\mathcal{K}$ because for $s \\ge 0$: it is continuous, $\\gamma(0) = 0$, and it is strictly increasing since its derivative $\\frac{d\\gamma}{ds} = \\frac{\\beta}{\\alpha}$ is a positive constant.
