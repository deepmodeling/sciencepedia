It is objective and expressed in precise mathematical language. Let us verify its consistency and if it is well-posed.\n\nThe constraints are $\\operatorname{tr} A = -4$ and $\\det A = 3$. The discriminant is given as $\\Delta = (\\operatorname{tr} A)^{2} - 4 \\det A$. Substituting the given values, we find $\\Delta = (-4)^{2} - 4(3) = 16 - 12 = 4$. Since $4 > 0$, the condition $\\Delta > 0$ is not an independent constraint but rather a consequence of the given trace and determinant. This redundancy does not represent a contradiction or flaw; it merely confirms a property that is required for the existence of real, distinct eigenvalues. The problem asks for the design of *a* matrix, so a unique solution is not required, and multiple matrices can satisfy the conditions. The problem is self-contained, consistent, and well-posed.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. The solution will now proceed.\n\nAn equilibrium point $x^*$ of the system $\\dot{x} = f(x)$ is a point where the vector field is zero, i.e., $f(x^*) = 0$. For the given linear system $\\dot{x} = A x$, the equilibrium points are solutions to $A x = 0$. Since we are given that $\\det A = 3 \\neq 0$, the matrix $A$ is invertible, and the only solution is the trivial one, $x = 0$. Thus, the origin is the unique equilibrium point of this system.\n\nThe stability and type of this equilibrium point are determined by the eigenvalues of the matrix $A$. The eigenvalues, denoted by $\\lambda$, are the roots of the characteristic polynomial $p(\\lambda) = \\det(A - \\lambda I)$, where $I$ is the $2 \\times 2$ identity matrix. For a general $2 \\times 2$ matrix $A = \\begin{pmatrix} a  b \\\\ c  d \\end{pmatrix}$, the characteristic equation is:\n$$ \\det \\begin{pmatrix} a-\\lambda  b \\\\ c  d-\\lambda \\end{pmatrix} = (a-\\lambda)(d-\\lambda) - bc = 0 $$\n$$ \\lambda^2 - (a+d)\\lambda + (ad-bc) = 0 $$\nThis equation can be expressed in terms of the trace and determinant of $A$:\n$$ \\lambda^2 - (\\operatorname{tr} A)\\lambda + (\\det A) = 0 $$\nThe roots of this quadratic equation, which are the eigenvalues $\\lambda_1$ and $\\lambda_2$, are given by the quadratic formula:\n$$ \\lambda_{1,2} = \\frac{\\operatorname{tr} A \\pm \\sqrt{(\\operatorname{tr} A)^2 - 4\\det A}}{2} = \\frac{\\operatorname{tr} A \\pm \\sqrt{\\Delta}}{2} $$\nThe classification of the equilibrium point depends on these eigenvalues. For the origin to be a stable node, two conditions must be met:\n1. The eigenvalues must be real and distinct. This requires the discriminant $\\Delta$ to be positive.\n2. The eigenvalues must both be negative.\n\nLet us apply the given constraints. We have $\\operatorname{tr} A = -4$ and $\\det A = 3$.\nFirst, we analyze the nature of the eigenvalues without constructing the matrix $A$. The characteristic equation for any such matrix is:\n$$ \\lambda^2 - (-4)\\lambda + 3 = 0 \\implies \\lambda^2 + 4\\lambda + 3 = 0 $$\nThe discriminant is $\\Delta = (4)^2 - 4(1)(3) = 16 - 12 = 4$. Since $\\Delta = 4 > 0$, the eigenvalues are real and distinct. This confirms the equilibrium is a node (or a saddle), not a focus or center.\n\nNext, we establish the stability. The Viete's formulas for the roots of the characteristic polynomial state:\n- Sum of eigenvalues: $\\lambda_1 + \\lambda_2 = \\operatorname{tr} A = -4$.\n- Product of eigenvalues: $\\lambda_1 \\lambda_2 = \\det A = 3$.\n\nSince the product $\\lambda_1 \\lambda_2 = 3$ is positive, the two real eigenvalues must have the same sign (both positive or both negative).\nSince the sum $\\lambda_1 + \\lambda_2 = -4$ is negative, it is impossible for both to be positive. Therefore, both eigenvalues must be negative.\nWith two distinct, real, negative eigenvalues, the origin is, by definition, a stable node. This confirms the internal consistency of the problem's requirements.\n\nNow, we must design an explicit matrix $A$ with integer entries that satisfies the given constraints. Let $A = \\begin{pmatrix} a  b \\\\ c  d \\end{pmatrix}$, where $a, b, c, d \\in \\mathbb{Z}$. We must satisfy:\n1. $a+d = -4$\n2. $ad - bc = 3$\n\nA systematic way to find such a matrix is to simplify the system of equations. Let us set one of the off-diagonal elements to zero, for instance $b=0$. The system becomes:\n1. $a+d = -4$\n2. $ad = 3$\n\nThis implies that $a$ and $d$ are the integer roots of the quadratic equation $z^2 - (a+d)z + ad = 0$, which is $z^2 + 4z + 3 = 0$. Factoring this polynomial gives $(z+1)(z+3)=0$. The roots are $z_1 = -1$ and $z_2 = -3$.\nWe can set $a=-1$ and $d=-3$. These are integers. The second equation, $ad - bc = 3$, becomes $(-1)(-3) - (0)c = 3$, or $3 = 3$. This equation holds for any integer value of $c$. We can choose a simple value, for example $c=1$.\nThus, a valid matrix is:\n$$ A = \\begin{pmatrix} -1  0 \\\\ 1  -3 \\end{pmatrix} $$\nLet us verify this matrix: its entries are integers; $\\operatorname{tr} A = -1 + (-3) = -4$; $\\det A = (-1)(-3) - (0)(1) = 3$. All constraints are satisfied.\n\nFinally, we confirm the classification by directly computing the eigenvalues of our designed matrix $A$. The characteristic equation is $\\det(A - \\lambda I) = 0$:\n$$ \\det \\begin{pmatrix} -1-\\lambda  0 \\\\ 1  -3-\\lambda \\end{pmatrix} = 0 $$\n$$ (-1-\\lambda)(-3-\\lambda) - (0)(1) = 0 $$\n$$ (1+\\lambda)(3+\\lambda) = 0 $$\nThe eigenvalues are $\\lambda_1 = -3$ and $\\lambda_2 = -1$.\nAs computed, the eigenvalues are real, distinct ($-3 \\neq -1$), and negative. This confirms that for the system $\\dot{x} = A x$ with our designed matrix $A$, the origin is indeed a stable node.\n\nThe problem requires the ordered pair of eigenvalues from smallest to largest. The eigenvalues are $-3$ and $-1$.

It is found to be self-contained, scientifically grounded in the principles of dynamical systems theory, and mathematically well-posed. The problem is a standard exercise in the stability analysis of a nonlinear system via linearization. We will proceed with the solution.\n\nThe system is described by the autonomous ordinary differential equation $\\dot{x} = f(x)$, where $x \\in \\mathbb{R}^{2}$ and the vector field $f$ is given by\n$$\nf(x_1, x_2) = \\begin{pmatrix} f_1(x_1, x_2) \\\\ f_2(x_1, x_2) \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix}\nx_{1} + x_{1}^{2} - x_{1} x_{2} \\\\\n-2 x_{2} + x_{1}^{3}\n\\end{pmatrix}.\n$$\n\nFirst, we verify that the origin, $x = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}$, is an equilibrium point. An equilibrium point $x^*$ must satisfy the condition $f(x^*) = 0$.

The Jacobian matrix is the matrix of all first-order partial derivatives:\n$$\nDf(x) = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{\\partial f_1}{\\partial x_1}  \\frac{\\partial f_1}{\\partial x_2} \\\\ \\frac{\\partial f_2}{\\partial x_1}  \\frac{\\partial f_2}{\\partial x_2} \\end{pmatrix}.\n$$\nWe compute the necessary partial derivatives:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial f_1}{\\partial x_1} = 1 + 2x_1 - x_2 \\\\\n\\frac{\\partial f_1}{\\partial x_2} = -x_1 \\\\\n\\frac{\\partial f_2}{\\partial x_1} = 3x_1^2 \\\\\n\\frac{\\partial f_2}{\\partial x_2} = -2\n$$\nSubstituting these into the matrix expression gives\n$$\nDf(x) = \\begin{pmatrix}\n1 + 2x_1 - x_2  -x_1 \\\\\n3x_1^2  -2\n\\end{pmatrix}.\n$$\nTo analyze the stability at the origin, we evaluate this Jacobian matrix at $x = (0, 0)$.

The stability of the equilibrium point is determined by the eigenvalues, $\\lambda_1$ and $\\lambda_2$, of $A$. The eigenvalues are the roots of the characteristic polynomial $p(\\lambda) = \\det(A - \\lambda I) = 0$. For a general $2 \\times 2$ matrix, this polynomial is $\\lambda^2 - \\text{tr}(A)\\lambda + \\det(A) = 0$. By Vieta's formulas, the product of the roots is equal to the constant term of the monic polynomial, thus $\\lambda_1 \\lambda_2 = \\det(A)$.\n\nWe compute the determinant of $A$:\n$$\n\\det(A) = \\det\\begin{pmatrix}\n1  0 \\\\\n0  -2\n\\end{pmatrix} = (1)(-2) - (0)(0) = -2.\n$$\nSince $\\det(A) = -2$, we have $\\lambda_1 \\lambda_2 = -2$. The product of the eigenvalues is negative. Let us consider the implications. If the eigenvalues were a complex conjugate pair, $\\lambda_{1,2} = \\alpha \\pm i\\beta$ with $\\beta \\neq 0$, their product would be $\\lambda_1 \\lambda_2 = (\\alpha + i\\beta)(\\alpha - i\\beta) = \\alpha^2 + \\beta^2$. As $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ are real, $\\alpha^2 \\ge 0$ and $\\beta^2 > 0$, so their product would be strictly positive. This contradicts our finding that $\\det(A) = -2  0$. Therefore, the eigenvalues $\\lambda_1$ and $\\lambda_2$ must both be real.\n\nFor two real numbers, their product is negative if and only if one is positive and the other is negative. Hence, one eigenvalue is positive and one is negative. For the linearized system $\\dot{\\xi} = A\\xi$, an equilibrium point with real eigenvalues of opposite sign is, by definition, a saddle point.\n\nThe eigenvalues of $A$ are evidently $\\lambda_1 = 1$ and $\\lambda_2 = -2$. The real parts of these eigenvalues are $\\text{Re}(\\lambda_1) = 1$ and $\\text{Re}(\\lambda_2) = -2$. Since neither real part is zero, the equilibrium point is hyperbolic. The Hartman-Grobman theorem states that for a hyperbolic equilibrium point, the phase portrait of the nonlinear system in a small neighborhood of the point is topologically equivalent to the phase portrait of its linearization. Consequently, since the origin is a saddle point for the linearized system, it is also a saddle point for the original nonlinear system. The sign of $\\det(Df(0))$ is sufficient in this 2D case because a negative determinant forces the eigenvalues to be real and of opposite sign, which is the defining characteristic of a saddle.\n\nThe value requested is the determinant of the Jacobian at the origin.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{-2}\n$$", "id": "2692833"}, {"introduction": "Linearization is a powerful but not infallible tool; its conclusions are not definitive when the equilibrium point is non-hyperbolic, i.e., when the linearized system has eigenvalues with zero real parts.

In our derived radial equation, $\\dot{r} = -\\frac{1}{3}r^3$, we can see that the coefficients of $r$ and $r^2$ are zero. The lowest-order power of $r$ that appears is $r^3$, which is an odd power.\nThe coefficient of this term is $-\\frac{1}{3}$. Since this is the first nonzero coefficient of an odd power of $r$, it is by definition the first nonzero Lyapunov constant.\nTherefore, $L_1 = -\\frac{1}{3}$.\n\nThe negative sign of $L_1$ indicates that for any small $r > 0$, $\\dot{r}  0$, meaning the trajectories spiral inward toward the origin.
