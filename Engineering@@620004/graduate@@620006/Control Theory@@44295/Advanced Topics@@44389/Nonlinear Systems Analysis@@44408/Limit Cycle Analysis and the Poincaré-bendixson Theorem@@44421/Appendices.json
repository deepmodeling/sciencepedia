It is therefore a valid problem. We proceed with the solution in two parts as requested.\n\nThe planar system is given by the equations:\n$$\n\\dot{x} = f_{1}(x,y) = x(1 - x - a y) = x - x^2 - axy\n$$\n$$\n\\dot{y} = f_{2}(x,y) = y(1 - b x - y) = y - bxy - y^2\n$$\nwith parameters $a > 0$ and $b > 0$, defined on the open first quadrant $D = \\{(x,y) \\in \\mathbb{R}^2 : x > 0, y > 0\\}$.\n\nFirst, we evaluate the classical Bendixson divergence. The partial derivatives of the vector field components are:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial f_{1}}{\\partial x} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}(x - x^2 - axy) = 1 - 2x - ay\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial f_{2}}{\\partial y} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}(y - bxy - y^2) = 1 - bx - 2y\n$$\nThe Bendixson divergence is the sum of these partial derivatives:\n$$\n\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{f} = \\frac{\\partial f_{1}}{\\partial x} + \\frac{\\partial f_{2}}{\\partial y} = (1 - 2x - ay) + (1 - bx - 2y) = 2 - (2+b)x - (a+2)y\n$$\nTo assess whether this expression has a constant sign on a domain within $D$, we analyze its value. The sign of the divergence depends on the location $(x,y)$ in the first quadrant. The expression is positive, negative, or zero depending on whether $(x,y)$ is below, above, or on the line defined by $2 - (2+b)x - (a+2)y = 0$. This line has negative slope and positive intercepts on both axes, so it passes through the first quadrant $D$. Consequently, the divergence changes sign within $D$.\n\nTo demonstrate this explicitly, we select at least two distinct points in $D$.\nLet us select a point close to the origin, for instance, $(x_{1}, y_{1}) = (\\frac{1}{2(2+b)}, \\frac{1}{2(a+2)})$. Since $a>0$ and $b>0$, this point is in $D$. At this point, the divergence is:\n$$\n\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{f}|_{(x_{1}, y_{1})} = 2 - (2+b)\\left(\\frac{1}{2(2+b)}\\right) - (a+2)\\left(\\frac{1}{2(a+2)}\\right) = 2 - \\frac{1}{2} - \\frac{1}{2} = 1\n$$\nSince $1 > 0$, the divergence is positive at this point.\nNow, let us select a point far from the origin, for instance, $(x_{2}, y_{2}) = (\\frac{2}{2+b}, \\frac{2}{a+2})$. This point is also in $D$. At this point, the divergence is:\n$$\n\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{f}|_{(x_{2}, y_{2})} = 2 - (2+b)\\left(\\frac{2}{2+b}\\right) - (a+2)\\left(\\frac{2}{a+2}\\right) = 2 - 2 - 2 = -2\n$$\nSince $-2 < 0$, the divergence is negative at this point.\nBecause the divergence takes both positive and negative values within $D$, it cannot have a constant sign on any region of $D$ that contains these two points. Any positively invariant rectangle intersecting a neighborhood of the origin, if it is to be a candidate for containing a limit cycle, would typically be large enough to include regions where the divergence has different signs. Thus, the classical Bendixson criterion is inconclusive for ruling out periodic orbits in $D$.\n\nSecond, we apply the Bendixson-Dulac criterion with the given Dulac function $B(x,y) = \\frac{1}{xy}$. This function is continuously differentiable on the domain $D$. We compute the Dulac divergence, which is $\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}(B f_{1}) + \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}(B f_{2})$.\nFirst, we find the products $B(x,y) f_{1}(x,y)$ and $B(x,y) f_{2}(x,y)$:\n$$\nB f_{1} = \\frac{1}{xy} \\cdot x(1-x-ay) = \\frac{1-x-ay}{y} = \\frac{1}{y} - \\frac{x}{y} - a\n$$\n$$\nB f_{2} = \\frac{1}{xy} \\cdot y(1-bx-y) = \\frac{1-bx-y}{x} = \\frac{1}{x} - b - \\frac{y}{x}\n$$\nNext, we compute the required partial derivatives:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}(B f_{1}) = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}\\left(\\frac{1}{y} - \\frac{x}{y} - a\\right) = -\\frac{1}{y}\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}(B f_{2}) = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}\\left(\\frac{1}{x} - b - \\frac{y}{x}\\right) = -\\frac{1}{x}\n$$\nThe Dulac divergence is the sum of these terms:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}(B f_{1}) + \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}(B f_{2}) = -\\frac{1}{y} - \\frac{1}{x} = -\\left(\\frac{1}{x} + \\frac{1}{y}\\right)\n$$\nThis is the required simplified expression.\n\nTo conclude, we analyze the sign of this Dulac divergence in the domain $D$. For any point $(x,y) \\in D$, we have $x > 0$ and $y > 0$. Therefore, $\\frac{1}{x} > 0$ and $\\frac{1}{y} > 0$, which implies that their sum $\\frac{1}{x} + \\frac{1}{y}$ is strictly positive. Consequently, the Dulac divergence, $-\\left(\\frac{1}{x} + \\frac{1}{y}\\right)$, is strictly negative for all $(x,y) \\in D$.\n\nThe domain $D$ (the open first quadrant) is a simply-connected region of $\\mathbb{R}^2$. The Bendixson-Dulac theorem states that if there exists a $C^1$ function $B(x,y)$ such that the expression $\\nabla \\cdot (B\\mathbf{f})$ has a constant sign (and is not identically zero) in a simply-connected domain, then there are no periodic orbits lying entirely within that domain. Since the Dulac divergence is strictly negative everywhere in $D$ for all parameter values $a>0$ and $b>0$, we conclude that the system has no periodic orbits in the first quadrant $D$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{-\\left(\\frac{1}{x} + \\frac{1}{y}\\right)}\n$$", "id": "2719213"}, {"introduction": "When negative criteria like Bendixson-Dulac do not rule out limit cycles, our focus shifts to proving their existence.

A complete solution will be provided.\n\n**Solution Development**\n\nThe problem will be solved by addressing each of the four specified tasks in sequence.\n\nFirst, we identify the invariant set and its period. An invariant set is a subset of the state space such that any trajectory starting in the set remains within it for all future time. We consider the circle defined by $r=1$. For a trajectory on this circle, the radial coordinate is constant at $r=1$. We examine the radial dynamics $\\dot{r} = r(1 - r^{2})$. Substituting $r=1$ into this equation gives:\n$$\n\\dot{r} = 1(1 - 1^{2}) = 1(1 - 1) = 0\n$$\nSince $\\dot{r}=0$ when $r=1$, a trajectory that starts on the circle $r=1$ will have its radius remain constant at $r=1$. Thus, the circle $C = \\{ (r, \\theta) \\in \\mathbb{R}_{\\ge 0} \\times [0, 2\\pi) \\mid r=1 \\}$ is an invariant set for the system. On this invariant circle, the dynamics are governed solely by the angular equation $\\dot{\\theta}=1$. A periodic orbit is a non-constant solution that returns to its starting state after some period $T > 0$. For a trajectory on the circle $r=1$, a full period corresponds to the angle $\\theta$ increasing by $2\\pi$ radians. Integrating the angular velocity equation yields $\\theta(t) = \\theta_0 + t$, where $\\theta_0 = \\theta(0)$. The period $T$ is the time required for $\\theta(T) = \\theta_0 + 2\\pi$. This gives:\n$$\n\\theta_0 + T = \\theta_0 + 2\\pi \\implies T = 2\\pi\n$$\nThis closed orbit on the circle $r=1$ is a periodic orbit with period $T = 2\\pi$.\n\nSecond, we employ the Poincaré–Bendixson theorem and analyze stability. The theorem requires a closed and bounded \"trapping region\" $D$ in the plane that contains no fixed points. A fixed point must satisfy $\\dot{r}=0$ and $\\dot{\\theta}=0$. The condition $\\dot{r} = r(1-r^2) = 0$ implies $r=0$ or $r=1$. However, $\\dot{\\theta}=1$ is never zero. The only location where the dynamics might be singular or halt is the origin, $r=0$. In Cartesian coordinates $(x, y)$, the vector field $\\mathbf{f}$ is given by $\\dot{x} = \\dot{r}\\cos\\theta - r\\dot{\\theta}\\sin\\theta$ and $\\dot{y} = \\dot{r}\\sin\\theta + r\\dot{\\theta}\\cos\\theta$. Substituting the given dynamics:\n$$\n\\dot{x} = r(1-r^2)\\cos\\theta - r\\sin\\theta = x(1 - (x^2+y^2)) - y\n$$\n$$\n\\dot{y} = r(1-r^2)\\sin\\theta + r\\cos\\theta = y(1 - (x^2+y^2)) + x\n$$\nAt the origin $(x,y)=(0,0)$, we have $\\dot{x}=0$ and $\\dot{y}=0$. Thus, the origin is the only fixed point of the system.\nLet us define an annular region $D = \\{ (r, \\theta) \\mid a \\le r \\le b \\}$ for some constants $0 < a < 1$ and $b > 1$.\nOn the inner boundary $r=a$, the radial velocity is $\\dot{r} = a(1-a^2) > 0$, so the vector field points outward from the inner boundary, into the annulus.\nOn the outer boundary $r=b$, the radial velocity is $\\dot{r} = b(1-b^2) < 0$, so the vector field points inward from the outer boundary, into the annulus.\nThis makes $D$ a trapping region. Any trajectory starting in $D$ remains in $D$ for all future time. Since $D$ contains no fixed points (as the only fixed point is at $r=0$, which is outside $D$), the Poincaré–Bendixson theorem guarantees that the $\\omega$-limit set of any trajectory in $D$ is a closed orbit. We have already established that $r=1$ is such a closed orbit.\nTo determine stability, we examine the behavior of $\\dot{r}$ near $r=1$. For $r>1$, $\\dot{r} < 0$, so trajectories are pushed inward toward $r=1$. For $0<r<1$, $\\dot{r} > 0$, so trajectories are pushed outward toward $r=1$. This indicates that the limit cycle at $r=1$ is stable, or attracting. More formally, we linearize the radial dynamics around $r=1$ by setting $r = 1+\\delta r$, where $|\\delta r| \\ll 1$:\n$$\n\\frac{d}{dt}(1+\\delta r) = \\dot{\\delta r} = (1+\\delta r)(1-(1+\\delta r)^2) = (1+\\delta r)(1 - (1+2\\delta r + O((\\delta r)^2))) \\approx (1+\\delta r)(-2\\delta r) \\approx -2\\delta r\n$$\nThe perturbation $\\delta r$ decays according to $\\dot{\\delta r} = -2 \\delta r$, which confirms that the orbit is attracting.\n\nThird, we compute the divergence of the vector field $\\mathbf{f}$ along the closed orbit. The vector field in polar coordinates has physical components $f_r = \\dot{r} = r(1-r^2)$ and $f_\\theta = r\\dot{\\theta} = r(1) = r$. The divergence in polar coordinates is given by the formula:\n$$\n\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{f} = \\frac{1}{r} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial r}(r f_r) + \\frac{1}{r} \\frac{\\partial f_\\theta}{\\partial \\theta}\n$$\nWe calculate the terms:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial r}(r f_r) = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial r}(r \\cdot r(1-r^2)) = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial r}(r^2 - r^4) = 2r - 4r^3\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial f_\\theta}{\\partial \\theta} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\theta}(r) = 0\n$$\nSubstituting these back into the divergence formula gives:\n$$\n\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{f} = \\frac{1}{r}(2r - 4r^3) + 0 = 2 - 4r^2\n$$\nWe evaluate the divergence along the closed orbit, where $r=1$:\n$$\n(\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{f})|_{r=1} = 2 - 4(1)^2 = -2\n$$\n\nFourth, we derive and evaluate the nontrivial Floquet multiplier $\\Lambda$. For a periodic orbit $\\gamma(t)$ of a planar system, the evolution of a small perturbation $\\xi(t)$ is described by the linear variational equation $\\dot{\\xi} = D\\mathbf{f}(\\gamma(t))\\xi$, where $D\\mathbf{f}$ is the Jacobian matrix of the vector field evaluated along the orbit. The Floquet multipliers are the eigenvalues of the monodromy matrix $\\Phi(T)$, where $\\Phi(t)$ is the fundamental matrix solution with $\\Phi(0)=I$. For a 2D system, there are two multipliers. One is always trivial, $\\lambda_1=1$, corresponding to perturbations along the flow direction. The other, nontrivial multiplier is denoted by $\\Lambda$. Liouville's formula states that the determinant of the fundamental matrix is related to the trace of the system matrix:\n$$\n\\det(\\Phi(t)) = \\exp\\left(\\int_0^t \\mathrm{tr}(D\\mathbf{f}(\\gamma(\\tau))) d\\tau\\right)\n$$\nThe trace of the Jacobian matrix is equal to the divergence of the vector field, $\\mathrm{tr}(D\\mathbf{f}) = \\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{f}$. The product of the Floquet multipliers equals the determinant of the monodromy matrix: $\\lambda_1 \\Lambda = (1)\\Lambda = \\det(\\Phi(T))$.\nTherefore, the nontrivial Floquet multiplier is given by:\n$$\n\\Lambda = \\exp\\left(\\int_0^T (\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{f})(\\gamma(t)) dt\\right)\n$$\nWe have already found that along the orbit $\\gamma(t)$ (where $r=1$), the divergence is a constant value $\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{f} = -2$, and the period is $T=2\\pi$. The integral is:\n$$\n\\int_0^{2\\pi} (-2) dt = -2[t]_0^{2\\pi} = -2(2\\pi) = -4\\pi\n$$\nFinally, substituting this result into the expression for $\\Lambda$:\n$$\n\\Lambda = \\exp(-4\\pi)\n$$\nThe magnitude of this multiplier is $|\\Lambda| = \\exp(-4\\pi) < 1$, which confirms our earlier finding that the limit cycle is attracting.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\exp(-4\\pi)}\n$$", "id": "2719239"}]}
