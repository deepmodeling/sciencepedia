The givens are a scalar nonlinear system described by the ordinary differential equation $\\dot{x} = -x^{3}$ where the state is $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$. The equilibrium point under investigation is the origin, $x=0$. The task is to analyze stability using Lyapunov's indirect and direct methods, and then to compute a specific hitting time $T$ for a trajectory initialized at $x(0) = x_{0}$ to reach the closed ball $\\{x \\in \\mathbb{R}: |x| \\le r\\}$, given $|x_{0}| > r > 0$. The problem is scientifically grounded in control theory, is mathematically well-posed, internally consistent, and contains sufficient information for a unique solution. The problem is therefore deemed valid and a solution may proceed.\n\nFirst, we analyze the stability using Lyapunov's indirect method, also known as stability by linearization. The nonlinear system is given by $\\dot{x} = f(x)$, where the vector field is $f(x) = -x^{3}$. To linearize the system around the equilibrium point $x_e = 0$, we compute the Jacobian matrix of $f(x)$ evaluated at this point. In this scalar case, the Jacobian is the first derivative:\n$$\nJ(x) = \\frac{df}{dx} = \\frac{d}{dx}(-x^{3}) = -3x^{2}\n$$\nThe matrix $A$ of the linearized system $\\dot{\\delta x} = A \\delta x$ is obtained by evaluating the Jacobian at the equilibrium point $x_e=0$:\n$$\nA = J(0) = -3(0)^{2} = 0\n$$\nThe linearized system is therefore $\\dot{\\delta x} = 0$. The eigenvalue of the matrix $A$ is $\\lambda = 0$. Lyapunov's indirect method states that if the real part of any eigenvalue of the linearization matrix $A$ is zero, then the method is inconclusive. One cannot determine the stability properties (stability, asymptotic stability, or instability) of the nonlinear system's equilibrium point from its linearization. Thus, this first analysis fails to provide a conclusion.\n\nNext, we proceed with Lyapunov's direct method. We must construct a suitable Lyapunov candidate function $V(x)$. A standard choice, motivated by the concept of energy, is a quadratic function of the state. Let us propose the function:\n$$\nV(x) = \\frac{1}{2}x^{2}\n$$\nThis function must be checked for the required properties. It is continuously differentiable. It is positive definite, as $V(0) = 0$ and $V(x) > 0$ for all $x \\neq 0$. It is also radially unbounded, since $V(x) \\to \\infty$ as $|x| \\to \\infty$. Now, we compute the time derivative of $V(x)$ along the trajectories of the system $\\dot{x} = -x^{3}$:\n$$\n\\dot{V}(x) = \\frac{dV}{dt} = \\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial x} \\frac{dx}{dt} = \\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial x} \\dot{x}\n$$\nThe partial derivative is $\\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial x} = x$. Substituting this and the system dynamics, we find:\n$$\n\\dot{V}(x) = (x)(-x^{3}) = -x^{4}\n$$\nThe time derivative $\\dot{V}(x)$ is negative definite, because $\\dot{V}(0) = 0$ and $\\dot{V}(x) < 0$ for all $x \\neq 0$. Since we have found a positive definite, radially unbounded Lyapunov function $V(x)$ for which its time derivative $\\dot{V}(x)$ is negative definite, we can conclude that the equilibrium point $x=0$ is globally asymptotically stable.\n\nThe problem requires a differential equation in terms of the Lyapunov function $V$ alone. We have the relations $V = \\frac{1}{2}x^{2}$ and $\\dot{V} = -x^{4}$. From the first relation, we can write $x^{2} = 2V$. Substituting this into the expression for $\\dot{V}$, we obtain:\n$$\n\\dot{V} = -(x^{2})^{2} = -(2V)^{2} = -4V^{2}\n$$\nThis is the required scalar differential equation for $V(t)$.\n\nFinally, we must quantify the convergence time $T$. We are asked to find the time it takes for a trajectory starting at $x(0) = x_{0}$ to enter the set $|x| \\le r$, where it is given that $|x_{0}| > r > 0$. The initial condition for the Lyapunov function is $V(0) = V_{0} = \\frac{1}{2}x_{0}^{2}$. The trajectory enters the specified region at time $T$, at which point $|x(T)| = r$. The value of the Lyapunov function at this time is $V(T) = V_{r} = \\frac{1}{2}r^{2}$. We solve the differential equation $\\frac{dV}{dt} = -4V^{2}$ by separation of variables:\n$$\n\\frac{dV}{V^{2}} = -4 dt\n$$\nWe integrate this equation from the initial time $t=0$ to the final time $t=T$:\n$$\n\\int_{V_{0}}^{V_{r}} V^{-2} dV = \\int_{0}^{T} -4 dt\n$$\nPerforming the integration yields:\n$$\n\\left[ -V^{-1} \\right]_{V_{0}}^{V_{r}} = \\left[ -4t \\right]_{0}^{T}\n$$\n$$\n-\\frac{1}{V_{r}} - \\left(-\\frac{1}{V_{0}}\\right) = -4T - 0\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{1}{V_{0}} - \\frac{1}{V_{r}} = -4T\n$$\nSolving for the hitting time $T$:\n$$\nT = \\frac{1}{4} \\left( \\frac{1}{V_{r}} - \\frac{1}{V_{0}} \\right)\n$$\nNow, substitute the expressions for $V_{r}$ and $V_{0}$ in terms of $r$ and $x_{0}$:\n$$\nT = \\frac{1}{4} \\left( \\frac{1}{\\frac{1}{2}r^{2}} - \\frac{1}{\\frac{1}{2}x_{0}^{2}} \\right)\n$$\n$$\nT = \\frac{1}{4} \\left( \\frac{2}{r^{2}} - \\frac{2}{x_{0}^{2}} \\right)\n$$\nSimplifying this expression gives the final analytical result for the hitting time:\n$$\nT = \\frac{1}{2} \\left( \\frac{1}{r^{2}} - \\frac{1}{x_{0}^{2}} \\right)\n$$\nThis is the exact time required for the state to travel from an initial value $x_{0}$ to the boundary of the region defined by $|x| \\le r$.

Both are positive, so $P \\succ 0$.\n\nNow, we derive a sufficient condition for the time derivative of the Lyapunov function, $\\dot{V}(x)$, to be negative. The derivative along the trajectories of the nonlinear system is:\n$$\n\\dot{V}(x) = \\nabla V(x)^\\top f(x) = (2Px)^\\top (Ax + g(x)) = x^\\top(A^\\top P + PA)x + 2x^\\top P g(x).\n$$\nUsing $A^\\top P + PA = -I_2$, this simplifies to:\n$$\n\\dot{V}(x) = -x^\\top I_2 x + 2x^\\top P g(x) = -\\lVert x \\rVert_2^2 + 2x^\\top P g(x).\n$$\nFor $\\dot{V}(x)$ to be negative, we require $2x^\\top P g(x) < \\lVert x \\rVert_2^2$. We bound the term involving $g(x)$. First, we find a bound on the norm of $g(x)$. Using the inequality $|x_i| \\le \\lVert x \\rVert_2$:\n$$\n\\lvert g_1(x) \\rvert = \\lvert c_1 x_1^3 + c_2 x_1 x_2^2 \\rvert \\le \\lvert c_1 \\rvert \\lvert x_1 \\rvert^3 + \\lvert c_2 \\rvert \\lvert x_1 \\rvert \\lvert x_2 \\rvert^2 \\le (\\lvert c_1 \\rvert + \\lvert c_2 \\rvert) \\lVert x \\rVert_2^3.\n$$\n$$\n\\lvert g_2(x) \\rvert = \\lvert c_3 x_1^2 x_2 + c_4 x_2^3 \\rvert \\le \\lvert c_3 \\rvert \\lvert x_1 \\rvert^2 \\lvert x_2 \\rvert + \\lvert c_4 \\rvert \\lvert x_2 \\rvert^3 \\le (\\lvert c_3 \\rvert + \\lvert c_4 \\rvert) \\lVert x \\rVert_2^3.\n$$\nThe Euclidean norm of $g(x)$ is therefore bounded by:\n$$\n\\lVert g(x) \\rVert_2 = \\sqrt{\\lvert g_1(x) \\rvert^2 + \\lvert g_2(x) \\rvert^2} \\le \\sqrt{(\\lvert c_1 \\rvert + \\lvert c_2 \\rvert)^2 \\lVert x \\rVert_2^6 + (\\lvert c_3 \\rvert + \\lvert c_4 \\rvert)^2 \\lVert x \\rVert_2^6} = c \\lVert x \\rVert_2^3,\n$$\nwhere $c = \\sqrt{(\\lvert c_1 \\rvert + \\lvert c_2 \\rvert)^2 + (\\lvert c_3 \\rvert + \\lvert c_4 \\rvert)^2}$.\n\nUsing this bound and the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, we bound $2x^\\top P g(x)$:\n$$\n2x^\\top P g(x) \\le 2 \\lvert x^\\top P g(x) \\rvert \\le 2 \\lVert Px \\rVert_2 \\lVert g(x) \\rVert_2.\n$$\nSince $P$ is symmetric positive definite, its induced $2$-norm is its largest eigenvalue, $\\lVert P \\rVert_2 = \\lambda_{\\max}(P)$. Thus, $\\lVert Px \\rVert_2 \\le \\lVert P \\rVert_2 \\lVert x \\rVert_2 = \\lambda_{\\max}(P) \\lVert x \\rVert_2$. Substituting the bounds:\n$$\n2x^\\top P g(x) \\le 2 (\\lambda_{\\max}(P) \\lVert x \\rVert_2) (c \\lVert x \\rVert_2^3) = 2c\\lambda_{\\max}(P) \\lVert x \\rVert_2^4.\n$$\nThe condition $\\dot{V}(x) < 0$ is therefore guaranteed if $-\\lVert x \\rVert_2^2 + 2c\\lambda_{\\max}(P) \\lVert x \\rVert_2^4 < 0$. For $x \\ne 0$, this simplifies to $2c\\lambda_{\\max}(P) \\lVert x \\rVert_2^2 < 1$, or $\\lVert x \\rVert_2^2 < \\frac{1}{2c\\lambda_{\\max}(P)}$.\n\nWe need to find an upper bound $\\rho_\\star$ on $\\rho$ such that for any $x$ in the sublevel set $\\{x \\mid V(x) \\le \\rho\\}$, the condition $\\dot{V}(x) < 0$ holds. For any $x$ in this set, we have the inequality $V(x) \\ge \\lambda_{\\min}(P) \\lVert x \\rVert_2^2$, which implies $\\lVert x \\rVert_2^2 \\le \\frac{V(x)}{\\lambda_{\\min}(P)} \\le \\frac{\\rho}{\\lambda_{\\min}(P)}$. To satisfy the negativity condition for all $x$ in the sublevel set, we require its boundary to be within the region of guaranteed negativity. We impose the strict inequality:\n$$\n\\frac{\\rho}{\\lambda_{\\min}(P)} < \\frac{1}{2c\\lambda_{\\max}(P)} \\implies \\rho < \\frac{\\lambda_{\\min}(P)}{2c\\lambda_{\\max}(P)}.\n$$\nThis gives the desired explicit upper bound $\\rho_\\star = \\frac{\\lambda_{\\min}(P)}{2c\\lambda_{\\max}(P)}$. The eigenvalues of $P$ are found from the characteristic equation $4\\lambda^2 - 6\\lambda + 1 = 0$, yielding $\\lambda = \\frac{3 \\pm \\sqrt{5}}{4}$. Thus, $\\lambda_{\\min}(P) = \\frac{3-\\sqrt{5}}{4}$ and $\\lambda_{\\max}(P) = \\frac{3+\\sqrt{5}}{4}$.\nThe bound is $\\rho_\\star = \\frac{(3-\\sqrt{5})/4}{2c(3+\\sqrt{5})/4} = \\frac{3-\\sqrt{5}}{2c(3+\\sqrt{5})} = \\frac{(3-\\sqrt{5})^2}{2c(9-5)} = \\frac{14 - 6\\sqrt{5}}{8c} = \\frac{7 - 3\\sqrt{5}}{4c}$.\n\nFor the numerical experiment, we generate initial conditions on the ellipse $x^\\top P x = \\rho$. A point $x$ on this ellipse can be generated from a point $y$ on a circle of radius $\\sqrt{\\rho}$ through a linear transformation. Let $P=LL^\\top$ be the Cholesky decomposition of $P$. Then $x^\\top P x = x^\\top L L^\\top x = (L^\\top x)^\\top (L^\\top x) = \\lVert L^\\top x \\rVert_2^2 = \\rho$. We define $y = L^\\top x$, so that $\\lVert y \\rVert_2 = \\sqrt{\\rho}$. The transformation is $x = (L^\\top)^{-1}y$. We will sample $N=24$ points $y_k = \\sqrt{\\rho} [\\cos \\theta_k, \\sin \\theta_k]^\\top$ with $\\theta_k = 2\\pi k/N$ for $k=0, \\dots, N-1$, and transform them to initial conditions $x_k$ for numerical integration.\n\nThe simulation of $\\dot{x}=f(x)$ for each $x_k$ will be performed over a time horizon $T=20$ using a numerical integrator with specified tolerances. Convergence is declared if the trajectory enters a small ball of radius $10^{-3}$ around the origin. Divergence is declared if the trajectory norm exceeds $10$. If all $N=24$ trajectories from the initial conditions on the ellipse $V(x) = \\rho = s \\rho_\\star$ converge, the test case is successful.\n\nThis completes the formal analytical derivation and the design of the numerical experiment.
