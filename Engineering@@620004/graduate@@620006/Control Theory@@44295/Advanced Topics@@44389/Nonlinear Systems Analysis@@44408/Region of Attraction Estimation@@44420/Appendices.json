This analysis will proceed from first principles, beginning with the identification and classification of equilibria, followed by a rigorous determination of their respective regions of attraction, and culminating in the calculation of a specified Lebesgue measure.\n\nFirst, we identify the equilibrium points of the system by solving the equation $\\dot{x} = 0$.\n$$x - x^{3} = 0$$\n$$x(1 - x^{2}) = 0$$\n$$x(1 - x)(1 + x) = 0$$\nThis yields three distinct equilibrium points: $x_{1}^{\\star} = -1$, $x_{2}^{\\star} = 0$, and $x_{3}^{\\star} = 1$.\n\nNext, we investigate the local stability of each equilibrium by linearization. The vector field is $f(x) = x - x^{3}$. The Jacobian of this one-dimensional system is the derivative of $f(x)$ with respect to $x$:\n$$J(x) = \\frac{df}{dx} = 1 - 3x^{2}$$\nAccording to the Hartman-Grobman theorem, the stability of a hyperbolic equilibrium point (where the real part of the eigenvalue is non-zero) is determined by the sign of the eigenvalue of the Jacobian evaluated at that point.\n- For the equilibrium $x_{1}^{\\star} = -1$:\n$$J(-1) = 1 - 3(-1)^{2} = 1 - 3 = -2$$\nSince the eigenvalue $\\lambda = -2 < 0$, the equilibrium at $x^{\\star} = -1$ is locally asymptotically stable (a sink).\n- For the equilibrium $x_{2}^{\\star} = 0$:\n$$J(0) = 1 - 3(0)^{2} = 1$$\nSince the eigenvalue $\\lambda = 1 > 0$, the equilibrium at $x^{\\star} = 0$ is unstable (a source).\n- For the equilibrium $x_{3}^{\\star} = 1$:\n$$J(1) = 1 - 3(1)^{2} = 1 - 3 = -2$$\nSince the eigenvalue $\\lambda = -2 < 0$, the equilibrium at $x^{\\star} = 1$ is locally asymptotically stable (a sink).\n\nWe now proceed to a global analysis to determine the regions of attraction. The vector field $f(x) = x - x^{3}$ is a polynomial and thus is continuously differentiable ($C^{\\infty}$) on $\\mathbb{R}$. This ensures that $f(x)$ is locally Lipschitz on any compact interval of $\\mathbb{R}$, which by the Picard-Lindelöf theorem guarantees the existence and uniqueness of solutions for any given initial condition $x(0) = x_{0}$.\n\nThe behavior of trajectories can be qualitatively understood by examining the sign of $\\dot{x} = x(1-x)(1+x)$ on the intervals defined by the equilibria:\n- For $x \\in (1, \\infty)$, let's test $x=2$: $\\dot{x} = 2(1-2)(1+2) = -6 < 0$. Trajectories move to the left, toward $x=1$.\n- For $x \\in (0, 1)$, let's test $x=0.5$: $\\dot{x} = 0.5(1-0.5)(1+0.5) > 0$. Trajectories move to the right, toward $x=1$.\n- For $x \\in (-1, 0)$, let's test $x=-0.5$: $\\dot{x} = -0.5(1-(-0.5))(1+(-0.5)) < 0$. Trajectories move to the left, toward $x=-1$.\n- For $x \\in (-\\infty, -1)$, let's test $x=-2$: $\\dot{x} = -2(1-(-2))(1+(-2)) > 0$. Trajectories move to the right, toward $x=-1$.\n\nThis phase-line analysis suggests that the region of attraction for $x^{\\star}=1$ is $(0, \\infty)$, the region of attraction for $x^{\\star}=-1$ is $(-\\infty, 0)$, and the point $x^{\\star}=0$ is the boundary separating these two basins of attraction.\n\nWe must rigorously justify these conclusions.\nLet $A(x^{\\star})$ denote the region of attraction (or basin of attraction) of an equilibrium $x^{\\star}$.\nFor the equilibrium $x^{\\star}=1$:\nLet an initial condition $x(0) = x_{0} \\in (0, 1)$. Since $\\dot{x} > 0$ in this interval, the solution $x(t)$ is a monotonically increasing function of time. As $x=1$ is an equilibrium point, uniqueness of solutions prevents $x(t)$ from crossing $1$. Thus, $x(t)$ is a monotonic increasing function bounded above by $1$. By the monotone convergence theorem, the limit $\\lim_{t \\to \\infty} x(t)$ must exist and must be an equilibrium point. The only equilibrium in the interval $(0, 1]$ is $x=1$. Therefore, $\\lim_{t \\to \\infty} x(t) = 1$.\nNow, let $x(0) = x_{0} \\in (1, \\infty)$. Since $\\dot{x} < 0$ in this interval, the solution $x(t)$ is monotonically decreasing and bounded below by $1$. By a similar argument, $\\lim_{t \\to \\infty} x(t) = 1$.\nTrivially, if $x(0)=1$, then $x(t)=1$ for all $t \\geq 0$.\nCombining these cases, we have rigorously established that the region of attraction for $x^{\\star}=1$ is $A(1) = (0, \\infty)$.\n\nFor the equilibrium $x^{\\star}=-1$:\nThe vector field $f(x)=x-x^3$ is an odd function, i.e., $f(-x)=-f(x)$. This implies that if $x(t)$ is a solution to $\\dot{x}=f(x)$, then $y(t) = -x(t)$ is also a solution because $\\dot{y}(t) = -\\dot{x}(t) = -f(x(t)) = -f(-y(t)) = f(y(t))$. Consequently, the phase portrait is symmetric with respect to the origin. The region of attraction for $x^{\\star}=-1$ must be the negative of the region of attraction for $x^{\\star}=1$. Thus, $A(-1) = (-\\infty, 0)$.\n\nFor the equilibrium $x^{\\star}=0$:\nThis is an unstable equilibrium. Any initial condition $x_{0} \\neq 0$, no matter how close to $0$, will result in a trajectory that moves away from $0$ and converges to either $1$ or $-1$. Therefore, the region of attraction for $x^{\\star}=0$ consists only of the point itself: $A(0) = \\{0\\}$.\n\nThe basin boundaries are the interfaces between the regions of attraction. The state space $\\mathbb{R}$ is partitioned into three disjoint sets: $A(-1) = (-\\infty, 0)$, $A(0) = \\{0\\}$, and $A(1) = (0, \\infty)$. The boundary of $A(1)$ is $\\partial A(1) = \\{0\\}$, and the boundary of $A(-1)$ is $\\partial A(-1) = \\{0\\}$. The point $x=0$ is an unstable equilibrium, and its stable manifold (which is just the point itself in this scalar case) forms the boundary between the basins of the two stable equilibria. Since for any large $|x|$, $\\dot{x} \\approx -x^3$, which pushes the trajectory towards the origin, no trajectory can escape to infinity. Thus, every point in $\\mathbb{R}$ must converge to one of the three equilibria. The partition is complete, and no other boundaries exist.\n\nFinally, we are asked to compute the Lebesgue measure of the intersection of the region of attraction of the equilibrium $x^{\\star}=1$ with the interval $[-2, 2]$.\nThe region of attraction of $x^{\\star}=1$ is $A(1) = (0, \\infty)$.\nThe interval is $I = [-2, 2]$.\nThe intersection of these two sets is:\n$$S = A(1) \\cap I = (0, \\infty) \\cap [-2, 2] = (0, 2]$$\nThe Lebesgue measure, $\\mu$, of an interval $(a, b]$ is given by $b-a$.\nTherefore, the measure of the intersection is:\n$$\\mu(S) = \\mu((0, 2]) = 2 - 0 = 2$$\nThe final answer is $2$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{2}$$", "id": "2738256"}, {"introduction": "For higher-dimensional systems, finding the exact boundary of the Region of Attraction (ROA) is rarely feasible, so we must instead turn to powerful estimation techniques.

The system dynamics are $\\dot{x} = f(x) = \\begin{bmatrix} -x_{1}+x_{1}x_{2} \\\\ -x_{2} \\end{bmatrix}$.

According to the direct method of Lyapunov, this requires that $\\dot{V}(x)$ be negative semi-definite within $\\Omega_c$, becoming zero only at the equilibrium point $x=0$.\n\nThe region of attraction estimate is compromised in any region of the state space where $\\dot{V}(x) > 0$.

If $x_{2} \\le 1$, the left-hand side is non-positive while the right-hand side is non-negative, so the inequality cannot be satisfied. Therefore, the \"unsafe\" region where $\\dot{V}(x)$ can be positive exists only where $x_{2} > 1$.\n\nWe seek the largest sublevel set $\\Omega_c$, which is a disk of radius $\\sqrt{c}$ centered at the origin, that does not enter this unsafe region. This means that for any $x$ such that $V(x) \\le c$, we must have $\\dot{V}(x) \\le 0$. The largest such $c$ is determined by the minimum value of $V(x)$ on the boundary of the unsafe region. This boundary is the set of points where $\\dot{V}(x) = 0$ (excluding the origin $x=0$, where $\\dot{V}(0)=0$ trivially).\n\nWe formulate this as a constrained optimization problem:\nMinimize $V(x) = x_{1}^{2}+x_{2}^{2}$ subject to the constraint $\\dot{V}(x) = -2x_{1}^{2} + 2x_{1}^{2}x_{2} - 2x_{2}^{2} = 0$, for $x \\neq 0$.\nThe constraint simplifies to:\n$$\nx_{1}^{2}(x_{2}-1) = x_{2}^{2}\n$$\nAs established, a non-trivial solution ($x_1 \\neq 0$) requires $x_{2} > 1$.

Using the inequality $|x_i| \\le \\lVert x \\rVert_2$:\n$$\n\\lvert g_1(x) \\rvert = \\lvert c_1 x_1^3 + c_2 x_1 x_2^2 \\rvert \\le \\lvert c_1 \\rvert \\lvert x_1 \\rvert^3 + \\lvert c_2 \\rvert \\lvert x_1 \\rvert \\lvert x_2 \\rvert^2 \\le (\\lvert c_1 \\rvert + \\lvert c_2 \\rvert) \\lVert x \\rVert_2^3.\n$$\n$$\n\\lvert g_2(x) \\rvert = \\lvert c_3 x_1^2 x_2 + c_4 x_2^3 \\rvert \\le \\lvert c_3 \\rvert \\lvert x_1 \\rvert^2 \\lvert x_2 \\rvert + \\lvert c_4 \\rvert \\lvert x_2 \\rvert^3 \\le (\\lvert c_3 \\rvert + \\lvert c_4 \\rvert) \\lVert x \\rVert_2^3.\n$$\nThe Euclidean norm of $g(x)$ is therefore bounded by:\n$$\n\\lVert g(x) \\rVert_2 = \\sqrt{\\lvert g_1(x) \\rvert^2 + \\lvert g_2(x) \\rvert^2} \\le \\sqrt{(\\lvert c_1 \\rvert + \\lvert c_2 \\rvert)^2 \\lVert x \\rVert_2^6 + (\\lvert c_3 \\rvert + \\lvert c_4 \\rvert)^2 \\lVert x \\rVert_2^6} = c \\lVert x \\rVert_2^3,\n$$\nwhere $c = \\sqrt{(\\lvert c_1 \\rvert + \\lvert c_2 \\rvert)^2 + (\\lvert c_3 \\rvert + \\lvert c_4 \\rvert)^2}$.\n\nUsing this bound and the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, we bound $2x^\\top P g(x)$:\n$$\n2x^\\top P g(x) \\le 2 \\lvert x^\\top P g(x) \\rvert \\le 2 \\lVert Px \\rVert_2 \\lVert g(x) \\rVert_2.\n$$\nSince $P$ is symmetric positive definite, its induced $2$-norm is its largest eigenvalue, $\\lVert P \\rVert_2 = \\lambda_{\\max}(P)$. Thus, $\\lVert Px \\rVert_2 \\le \\lVert P \\rVert_2 \\lVert x \\rVert_2 = \\lambda_{\\max}(P) \\lVert x \\rVert_2$. Substituting the bounds:\n$$\n2x^\\top P g(x) \\le 2 (\\lambda_{\\max}(P) \\lVert x \\rVert_2) (c \\lVert x \\rVert_2^3) = 2c\\lambda_{\\max}(P) \\lVert x \\rVert_2^4.\n$$\nThe condition $\\dot{V}(x)  0$ is therefore guaranteed if $-\\lVert x \\rVert_2^2 + 2c\\lambda_{\\max}(P) \\lVert x \\rVert_2^4  0$. For $x \\ne 0$, this simplifies to $2c\\lambda_{\\max}(P) \\lVert x \\rVert_2^2  1$, or $\\lVert x \\rVert_2^2  \\frac{1}{2c\\lambda_{\\max}(P)}$.\n\nWe need to find an upper bound $\\rho_\\star$ on $\\rho$ such that for any $x$ in the sublevel set $\\{x \\mid V(x) \\le \\rho\\}$, the condition $\\dot{V}(x)  0$ holds. For any $x$ in this set, we have the inequality $V(x) \\ge \\lambda_{\\min}(P) \\lVert x \\rVert_2^2$, which implies $\\lVert x \\rVert_2^2 \\le \\frac{V(x)}{\\lambda_{\\min}(P)} \\le \\frac{\\rho}{\\lambda_{\\min}(P)}$. To satisfy the negativity condition for all $x$ in the sublevel set, we require its boundary to be within the region of guaranteed negativity. We impose the strict inequality:\n$$\n\\frac{\\rho}{\\lambda_{\\min}(P)}  \\frac{1}{2c\\lambda_{\\max}(P)} \\implies \\rho  \\frac{\\lambda_{\\min}(P)}{2c\\lambda_{\\max}(P)}.\n$$\nThis gives the desired explicit upper bound $\\rho_\\star = \\frac{\\lambda_{\\min}(P)}{2c\\lambda_{\\max}(P)}$. The eigenvalues of $P$ are found from the characteristic equation of $4P$, which is $\\mu^2 - 6\\mu + 4 = 0$, yielding $\\mu = 3 \\pm \\sqrt{5}$. Thus, the eigenvalues of $P$ are $\\lambda_{\\min}(P) = \\frac{3-\\sqrt{5}}{4}$ and $\\lambda_{\\max}(P) = \\frac{3+\\sqrt{5}}{4}$.\nThe bound is $\\rho_\\star = \\frac{(3-\\sqrt{5})/4}{2c(3+\\sqrt{5})/4} = \\frac{3-\\sqrt{5}}{2c(3+\\sqrt{5})} = \\frac{(3-\\sqrt{5})^2}{2c(9-5)} = \\frac{14 - 6\\sqrt{5}}{8c} = \\frac{7 - 3\\sqrt{5}}{4c}$.\n\nFor the numerical experiment, we generate initial conditions on the ellipse $x^\\top P x = \\rho$. A point $x$ on this ellipse can be generated from a point $y$ on a circle of radius $\\sqrt{\\rho}$ through a linear transformation. Let $P=LL^\\top$ be the Cholesky decomposition of $P$. Then $x^\\top P x = x^\\top L L^\\top x = (L^\\top x)^\\top (L^\\top x) = \\lVert L^\\top x \\rVert_2^2 = \\rho$. We define $y = L^\\top x$, so that $\\lVert y \\rVert_2 = \\sqrt{\\rho}$. The transformation is $x = (L^\\top)^{-1}y$. We will sample $N=24$ points $y_k = \\sqrt{\\rho} [\\cos \\theta_k, \\sin \\theta_k]^\\top$ with $\\theta_k = 2\\pi k/N$ for $k=0, \\dots, N-1$, and transform them to initial conditions $x_k$ for numerical integration.\n\nThe simulation of $\\dot{x}=f(x)$ for each $x_k$ will be performed over a time horizon $T=20$ using a numerical integrator with specified tolerances. Convergence is declared if the trajectory enters a small ball of radius $10^{-3}$ around the origin. Divergence is declared if the trajectory norm exceeds $10$. If all $N=24$ trajectories from the initial conditions on the ellipse $V(x) = \\rho = s \\rho_\\star$ converge, the test case is successful.\n\nThis completes the formal analytical derivation and the design of the numerical experiment.
