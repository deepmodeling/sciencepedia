We proceed with a complete solution derived from first principles.\n\nThe system is a single-input single-output (SISO) nonlinear system given by the state equations:\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\dot{x}_{1} = x_{2} \\\\\n\\dot{x}_{2} = -x_{1} + x_{1}^{3} + u\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\nThe measured output is given by:\n$$\ny = x_{2}\n$$\nThis system can be written in the standard nonlinear affine form $\\dot{x} = f(x) + g(x)u$, where $x \\in \\mathbb{R}^{2}$ is the state vector. We define:\n$$\nx = \\begin{pmatrix} x_{1} \\\\ x_{2} \\end{pmatrix}, \\quad f(x) = \\begin{pmatrix} x_{2} \\\\ -x_{1} + x_{1}^{3} \\end{pmatrix}, \\quad g(x) = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe output equation is $y = h(x)$, where $h(x) = x_{2}$.\n\nFirst, we determine the relative degree $r$ of the system. The relative degree is the smallest integer $k \\geq 1$ such that the $k$-th time derivative of the output, $y^{(k)}$, explicitly depends on the input $u$. This is systematically determined using Lie derivatives. The Lie derivative of a scalar function $h(x)$ with respect to a vector field $f(x)$ is defined as $L_f h(x) = \\nabla h(x) \\cdot f(x)$.\n\nWe calculate the first time derivative of the output $y$:\n$$\n\\dot{y} = \\frac{d}{dt}h(x) = \\frac{\\partial h}{\\partial x} \\dot{x} = \\frac{\\partial h}{\\partial x} (f(x) + g(x)u) = L_f h(x) + L_g h(x) u\n$$\nFor our system, the function $h(x) = x_{2}$, so its gradient is $\\nabla h(x) = \\begin{pmatrix} 0  1 \\end{pmatrix}$. We compute the Lie derivatives:\n$$\nL_g h(x) = \\nabla h(x) \\cdot g(x) = \\begin{pmatrix} 0  1 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix} = 1\n$$\nSince $L_g h(x) \\neq 0$ for all $x$, the input $u$ appears in the first derivative of the output. Therefore, the relative degree is $r=1$.\n\nNext, we derive the static state feedback control law $u(x)$ that enforces the output to be identically zero, i.e., $y(t) \\equiv 0$ for all $t \\geq 0$. This condition implies that all time derivatives of $y$ must also be zero. Specifically, we require $\\dot{y}(t) = 0$.\nThe expression for $\\dot{y}$ is:\n$$\n\\dot{y} = L_f h(x) + L_g h(x) u\n$$\nWe calculate $L_f h(x)$:\n$$\nL_f h(x) = \\nabla h(x) \\cdot f(x) = \\begin{pmatrix} 0  1 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} x_{2} \\\\ -x_{1} + x_{1}^{3} \\end{pmatrix} = -x_{1} + x_{1}^{3}\n$$\nSubstituting these results into the equation for $\\dot{y}$:\n$$\n\\dot{y} = (-x_{1} + x_{1}^{3}) + (1)u\n$$\nSetting $\\dot{y} = 0$ and solving for $u$ gives the required feedback law:\n$$\n0 = -x_{1} + x_{1}^{3} + u \\implies u(x) = x_{1} - x_{1}^{3}\n$$\n\nFinally, we find the zero dynamics. The zero dynamics are the internal dynamics of the system when the output is held at zero by the control law $u(x)$. These dynamics evolve on the zero-dynamics manifold, $Z^*$, which is the largest set of states on which the output and its first $r-1$ time derivatives can be maintained at zero. For a system with relative degree $r=1$, this manifold is defined by the constraint $h(x)=0$.\n$$\nZ^* = \\{ x \\in \\mathbb{R}^{2} \\mid h(x) = 0 \\} = \\{ x \\in \\mathbb{R}^{2} \\mid x_{2} = 0 \\}\n$$\nTo find the zero dynamics, we restrict the system's state equations to this manifold. The evolution of the state $x_1$ is given by the equation $\\dot{x}_{1} = x_{2}$. On the manifold $Z^*$, we have the constraint $x_{2}=0$. Substituting this into the equation for $\\dot{x}_{1}$ yields the zero dynamics:\n$$\n\\dot{x}_{1} = 0\n$$\nThis equation describes the internal dynamics of the system when the output is forced to be zero. Specifically, the state $x_1$ becomes constant. To confirm the invariance of the manifold, we check the dynamics of $x_2$ under the control law $u(x) = x_{1} - x_{1}^{3}$:\n$$\n\\dot{x}_{2} = -x_{1} + x_{1}^{3} + u = -x_{1} + x_{1}^{3} + (x_{1} - x_{1}^{3}) = 0\n$$\nSince $\\dot{x}_{2}=0$ on the manifold, any trajectory starting with $x_{2}(0)=0$ will have $x_{2}(t)=0$ for all $t  0$, confirming that $Z^*$ is an invariant manifold under this feedback. The expression for $\\dot{x}_{1}$ on this manifold is therefore $0$.\n\nThe three required quantities are:\n1.  Relative degree $r$: $1$\n2.  Feedback law $u(x)$: $x_{1} - x_{1}^{3}$\n3.

A complete solution will be provided.\n\nThe solution proceeds by following the fundamental definitions provided in the problem statement.\n\n**1. Determination of Relative Degree**\n\nThe relative degree $r$ is the smallest positive integer such that $L_{g}L_{f}^{r-1}h(x) \\neq 0$. We compute the Lie derivatives of the output function $y = h(x) = x_{1}$ with respect to the vector fields $f(x)$ and $g(x)$.\n\nThe gradient of $h(x)$ is:\n$$\n\\nabla h(x) = \\begin{bmatrix} \\frac{\\partial h}{\\partial x_{1}}  \\frac{\\partial h}{\\partial x_{2}} \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} 1  0 \\end{bmatrix}\n$$\nThe first time derivative of the output is:\n$$\n\\dot{y} = L_{f}h(x) + L_{g}h(x)u\n$$\nWe compute the constituents:\n$$\nL_{f}h(x) = \\nabla h(x) \\cdot f(x) = \\begin{bmatrix} 1  0 \\end{bmatrix} \\begin{bmatrix} x_{2} \\\\ -x_{1} - x_{2}^{3} \\end{bmatrix} = x_{2}\n$$\n$$\nL_{g}h(x) = \\nabla h(x) \\cdot g(x) = \\begin{bmatrix} 1  0 \\end{bmatrix} \\begin{bmatrix} 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{bmatrix} = 0\n$$\nSince $L_{g}h(x) = 0$, the relative degree $r$ must be greater than $1$. We must differentiate the output again. The second time derivative is:\n$$\n\\ddot{y} = \\frac{d}{dt}(L_{f}h(x)) = \\nabla(L_{f}h(x)) \\cdot (f(x) + g(x)u) = L_{f}^{2}h(x) + L_{g}L_{f}h(x)u\n$$\nLet $\\psi(x) = L_{f}h(x) = x_{2}$. The gradient of $\\psi(x)$ is:\n$$\n\\nabla \\psi(x) = \\begin{bmatrix} \\frac{\\partial \\psi}{\\partial x_{1}}  \\frac{\\partial \\psi}{\\partial x_{2}} \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} 0  1 \\end{bmatrix}\n$$\nNow we compute the Lie derivatives required for $\\ddot{y}$:\n$$\nL_{f}^{2}h(x) = L_{f}\\psi(x) = \\nabla \\psi(x) \\cdot f(x) = \\begin{bmatrix} 0  1 \\end{bmatrix} \\begin{bmatrix} x_{2} \\\\ -x_{1} - x_{2}^{3} \\end{bmatrix} = -x_{1} - x_{2}^{3}\n$$\n$$\nL_{g}L_{f}h(x) = L_{g}\\psi(x) = \\nabla \\psi(x) \\cdot g(x) = \\begin{bmatrix} 0  1 \\end{bmatrix} \\begin{bmatrix} 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{bmatrix} = 1\n$$\nSince $L_{g}L_{f}^{2-1}h(x) = 1 \\neq 0$ for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}^{2}$, the relative degree is well-defined everywhere and is equal to $r=2$.\n\n**2. Construction of the Linearizing State Feedback**\n\nWe have the input-output relationship:\n$$\ny^{(r)} = y^{(2)} = \\ddot{y} = L_{f}^{2}h(x) + L_{g}L_{f}h(x)u\n$$\nSubstituting the computed expressions:\n$$\n\\ddot{y} = (-x_{1} - x_{2}^{3}) + (1)u\n$$\nThe objective is to find a state feedback law $u = \\alpha(x) + \\beta(x)v$ that enforces the linear dynamics $\\ddot{y} = v$, where $v$ is the new external input. Equating the two expressions for $\\ddot{y}$ yields:\n$$\nv = -x_{1} - x_{2}^{3} + u\n$$\nSolving for $u$ provides the required linearizing control law:\n$$\nu_{\\mathrm{lin}}(x,v) = x_{1} + x_{2}^{3} + v\n$$\nThis corresponds to the general form with $\\alpha(x) = x_{1} + x_{2}^{3}$ and $\\beta(x) = (L_{g}L_{f}h(x))^{-1} = 1$. Since $\\beta(x)$ is non-zero everywhere, the control law is well-defined for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}^{2}$.\n\n**3. Zero Dynamics and Internal Dynamics**\n\nThe zero dynamics manifold, $\\mathcal{Z}$, is defined as the set of states for which the output and its first $r-1$ Lie derivatives along $f$ are zero:\n$$\n\\mathcal{Z} = \\{x \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n} \\mid h(x)=0, L_{f}h(x)=0, \\dots, L_{f}^{r-1}h(x)=0\\}\n$$\nFor this system, with $n=2$ and $r=2$, the conditions are:\n1. $h(x) = x_{1} = 0$\n2. $L_{f}h(x) = x_{2} = 0$\n\nThese two conditions define the zero dynamics manifold as the origin of the state space:\n$$\n\\mathcal{Z} = \\{x \\in \\mathbb{R}^{2} \\mid x_{1}=0, x_{2}=0\\} = \\{(0,0)\\}\n$$\nThe internal dynamics are the dynamics of the system constrained to the manifold $\\mathcal{Z}$ when the output is forced to be identically zero. Forcing $y(t) \\equiv 0$ implies that all its time derivatives are also zero, which requires setting the new input $v \\equiv 0$. The dimension of the internal dynamics (or zero dynamics subsystem) is given by $n-r$. In this case, the dimension is $2-2=0$. A zero-dimensional dynamic system corresponds to a system with no internal states. The state is constrained to a single point, $\\mathcal{Z} = \\{(0,0)\\}$, and cannot evolve. Therefore, there are no non-trivial internal dynamics. As per the problem instructions, this is indicated by $\\varnothing$.\nTo confirm, applying the control law with $v=0$, i.e., $u = x_1+x_2^3$, to the system gives:\n$$\n\\dot{x}_{1} = x_{2}\n$$\n$$\n\\dot{x}_{2} = -x_{1} - x_{2}^{3} + u = -x_{1} - x_{2}^{3} + (x_{1} + x_{2}^{3}) = 0\n$$\nOn the manifold $\\mathcal{Z}$, where $x_{1}=0$ and $x_{2}=0$, we have $\\dot{x}_{1}=0$ and $\\dot{x}_{2}=0$. The origin is an equilibrium point, confirming the invariance of $\\mathcal{Z}$.

The $r$-th derivative of the output $y$ is given by the general formula:\n$$\ny^{(r)} = L_{f}^{r}h(x) + L_{g}L_{f}^{r-1}h(x)u\n$$\nFor $r=2$, this becomes:\n$$\n\\ddot{y} = y^{(2)} = L_{f}^{2}h(x) + L_{g}L_{f}h(x)u\n$$\nWe have already computed $L_{f}h(x) = x_{2}$ and $L_{g}L_{f}h(x) = 1$. We now compute $L_{f}^{2}h(x)$:\n$$\nL_{f}^{2}h(x) = L_{f}(L_{f}h(x)) = \\nabla(L_{f}h(x)) \\cdot f(x) = \\begin{pmatrix} 0  1  0 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} x_{2} \\\\ x_{3} \\\\ x_{3} + x_{1}^{2} \\end{pmatrix} = x_{3}\n$$\nSubstituting these results into the expression for $\\ddot{y}$:\n$$\n\\ddot{y} = x_{3} + (1)u\n$$\nWe require the input-output map to be a chain of integrators, $\\ddot{y} = v$, where $v$ is the new external input. Therefore:\n$$\nv = x_{3} + u\n$$\nSolving for the control input $u$ yields the feedback law:\n$$\nu = -x_{3} + v\n$$\nComparing this to the form $u = \\alpha(x) + \\beta(x)v$, we identify the components:\n$$\n\\alpha(x) = -x_{3}, \\quad \\beta(x) = 1\n$$\n\nNow, we analyze the zero dynamics. The zero dynamics are the internal dynamics of the system when the output is forced to be zero for all time, $y(t) \\equiv 0$.

To keep the output at zero, the new input is set to $v=0$. The feedback control law becomes $u = -x_{3}$.

Since $\\lambda  0$, the origin of the zero dynamics is unstable.\n\nThis instability has a critical implication. Input-output linearization guarantees control over the output variable $y$. With a proper choice of $v$, for example $v = -k_{1}y - k_{0}\\dot{y}$, one can ensure that $y(t) \\to 0$. However, the control law $u = -x_{3} + v$ achieves this at the expense of ignoring the internal state $x_{3}$. Because the zero dynamics $\\dot{x}_{3} = x_{3}$ are unstable, the state $x_{3}$ will grow unboundedly if its initial value $x_{3}(0)$ is non-zero. Consequently, the control signal $u$ will also grow without bound. This demonstrates that while input-output linearization can achieve its primary objective of output tracking, it cannot stabilize the full internal state of the system if the system is non-minimum phase (i.e., has unstable zero dynamics).\n\nFinally, we find the closed-form analytic expression for $x_{3}(t)$ under the zero dynamics, given the initial condition $x_{3}(0)=x_{30}$.
