The vector fields are $X = \\partial_{x} + y\\,\\partial_{z}$ and $Y = \\partial_{y}$.\n\nFirst, we compute the Lie bracket $[X,Y]$. According to the definition provided, for any smooth function $\\phi: \\mathbb{R}^{3} \\to \\mathbb{R}$, the Lie bracket $[X,Y]$ is a vector field such that $[X,Y](\\phi) = X\\big(Y(\\phi)\\big) - Y\\big(X(\\phi)\\big)$.\n\nLet us compute the two terms separately.\nThe action of $Y$ on $\\phi$ is:\n$$Y(\\phi) = \\partial_{y}(\\phi) = \\frac{\\partial\\phi}{\\partial y}$$\nNow, we apply the vector field $X$ to this result:\n$$X(Y(\\phi)) = X\\left(\\frac{\\partial\\phi}{\\partial y}\\right) = (\\partial_{x} + y\\,\\partial_{z})\\left(\\frac{\\partial\\phi}{\\partial y}\\right) = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}\\left(\\frac{\\partial\\phi}{\\partial y}\\right) + y\\,\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z}\\left(\\frac{\\partial\\phi}{\\partial y}\\right) = \\frac{\\partial^{2}\\phi}{\\partial x \\partial y} + y\\,\\frac{\\partial^{2}\\phi}{\\partial z \\partial y}$$\n\nNext, we compute the second term, $Y\\big(X(\\phi)\\big)$. First, the action of $X$ on $\\phi$ is:\n$$X(\\phi) = (\\partial_{x} + y\\,\\partial_{z})(\\phi) = \\frac{\\partial\\phi}{\\partial x} + y\\,\\frac{\\partial\\phi}{\\partial z}$$\nNow, we apply the vector field $Y$ to this result, using the product rule for differentiation on the second term:\n$$Y(X(\\phi)) = Y\\left(\\frac{\\partial\\phi}{\\partial x} + y\\,\\frac{\\partial\\phi}{\\partial z}\\right) = \\partial_{y}\\left(\\frac{\\partial\\phi}{\\partial x} + y\\,\\frac{\\partial\\phi}{\\partial z}\\right) = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}\\left(\\frac{\\partial\\phi}{\\partial x}\\right) + \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}\\left(y\\,\\frac{\\partial\\phi}{\\partial z}\\right)$$\n$$Y(X(\\phi)) = \\frac{\\partial^{2}\\phi}{\\partial y \\partial x} + \\left(\\frac{\\partial y}{\\partial y}\\cdot\\frac{\\partial\\phi}{\\partial z} + y\\cdot\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}\\left(\\frac{\\partial\\phi}{\\partial z}\\right)\\right)$$\n$$Y(X(\\phi)) = \\frac{\\partial^{2}\\phi}{\\partial y \\partial x} + \\frac{\\partial\\phi}{\\partial z} + y\\,\\frac{\\partial^{2}\\phi}{\\partial y \\partial z}$$\n\nNow we combine the two parts to find $[X,Y](\\phi)$:\n$$[X,Y](\\phi) = \\left(\\frac{\\partial^{2}\\phi}{\\partial x \\partial y} + y\\,\\frac{\\partial^{2}\\phi}{\\partial z \\partial y}\\right) - \\left(\\frac{\\partial^{2}\\phi}{\\partial y \\partial x} + \\frac{\\partial\\phi}{\\partial z} + y\\,\\frac{\\partial^{2}\\phi}{\\partial y \\partial z}\\right)$$\nSince $\\phi$ is a smooth function, its mixed partial derivatives are equal by Clairaut's theorem, i.e., $\\frac{\\partial^{2}\\phi}{\\partial x \\partial y} = \\frac{\\partial^{2}\\phi}{\\partial y \\partial x}$ and $\\frac{\\partial^{2}\\phi}{\\partial z \\partial y} = \\frac{\\partial^{2}\\phi}{\\partial y \\partial z}$. The expression simplifies to:\n$$[X,Y](\\phi) = \\frac{\\partial^{2}\\phi}{\\partial x \\partial y} - \\frac{\\partial^{2}\\phi}{\\partial y \\partial x} + y\\,\\frac{\\partial^{2}\\phi}{\\partial z \\partial y} - y\\,\\frac{\\partial^{2}\\phi}{\\partial y \\partial z} - \\frac{\\partial\\phi}{\\partial z} = -\\frac{\\partial\\phi}{\\partial z}$$\nThis result means that the Lie bracket operator $[X,Y]$ acts on any smooth function $\\phi$ as $-\\partial_{z}$. Therefore, the Lie bracket as a vector field is:\n$$[X,Y] = -\\partial_{z}$$\nThis can be written in the coordinate basis $\\{\\partial_{x}, \\partial_{y}, \\partial_{z}\\}$ as $0 \\cdot \\partial_{x} + 0 \\cdot \\partial_{y} - 1 \\cdot \\partial_{z}$.\n\nSecond, we determine if the distribution $\\mathcal{D} = \\mathrm{span}\\{X,Y\\}$ is involutive. By definition, a rank-$2$ distribution is involutive if and only if the Lie bracket of its generating vector fields belongs pointwise to the distribution. That is, we must check if $[X,Y] \\in \\mathcal{D}$ for all points in $\\mathbb{R}^{3}$.\nThis is equivalent to checking if there exist smooth functions $c_{1}(x,y,z)$ and $c_{2}(x,y,z)$ such that:\n$$[X,Y] = c_{1}X + c_{2}Y$$\nSubstituting the expressions for the vector fields:\n$$-\\partial_{z} = c_{1}(\\partial_{x} + y\\,\\partial_{z}) + c_{2}(\\partial_{y})$$\n$$-\\partial_{z} = c_{1}\\partial_{x} + c_{2}\\partial_{y} + c_{1}y\\,\\partial_{z}$$\nWe can equate the components of the vector fields in the basis $\\{\\partial_{x}, \\partial_{y}, \\partial_{z}\\}$:\n\\begin{enumerate}\n    \\item Coefficient of $\\partial_{x}$: $0 = c_{1}$\n    \\item Coefficient of $\\partial_{y}$: $0 = c_{2}$\n    \\item Coefficient of $\\partial_{z}$: $-1 = c_{1}y$\n\\end{enumerate}\nFrom the first equation, we find $c_{1} = 0$. Substituting this into the third equation yields $-1 = (0)y$, which simplifies to $-1 = 0$. This is a contradiction.\nTherefore, there exist no such functions $c_1$ and $c_2$. The Lie bracket $[X,Y] = -\\partial_{z}$ does not lie in the plane spanned by $X$ and $Y$ at any point.\nThus, the distribution $\\mathcal{D}$ is not involutive. The indicator variable is $I=0$.\n\nFinally, we interpret this finding in the context of Frobenius' theorem. The (differentiable version of) Frobenius' theorem states that a smooth distribution is completely integrable if and only if it is involutive. \"Integrable\" means that through any point in the manifold, there exists an integral submanifold whose tangent space at every point coincides with the distribution. For our rank-$2$ distribution $\\mathcal{D}$ on $\\mathbb{R}^{3}$, integrability would imply the existence of a foliation of $\\mathbb{R}^{3}$ by $2$-dimensional surfaces such that at every point, the tangent plane to the surface is spanned by the vectors $X$ and $Y$.\nSince our calculation has shown that $\\mathcal{D}$ is not involutive, we conclude from Frobenius' theorem that $\\mathcal{D}$ is not integrable. It is impossible to find a family of surfaces in $\\mathbb{R}^{3}$ whose tangent planes are everywhere defined by $\\mathcal{D}$. The fact that $[X,Y] \\notin \\mathcal{D}$ signifies that an infinitesimal displacement along $X$ followed by one along $Y$ (and back) does not return to the original plane spanned by $\\{X, Y\\}$, but rather has a component in a new direction, in this case, the $-\\partial_{z}$ direction.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n-\\partial_{z} & 0\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "2709341"}, {"introduction": "An integrable distribution implies that motion is confined to lower-dimensional submanifolds, which can be described by level sets of some function.

The state space is $\\mathbb{R}^{3}$ with coordinates $(x, y, z)$.\n2.  The control vector fields are $f_{1} = \\partial_{x} + y\\,\\partial_{z}$ and $f_{2} = \\partial_{y}$. These are smooth vector fields on $\\mathbb{R}^{3}$.\n3.  A smooth function $h(x, y, z)$ is sought.\n4.  The conditions on $h$ are that its Lie derivatives along both $f_{1}$ and $f_{2}$ vanish: $L_{f_{1}}h = 0$ and $L_{f_{2}}h = 0$.\n\nThe problem is scientifically grounded, being a standard question in differential geometry and nonlinear control theory. It is well-posed, objective, and self-contained, with no apparent contradictions or ambiguities. The terminology used, such as Lie derivative, Lie bracket, and Frobenius' theorem, is standard. Therefore, the problem is deemed valid and a solution will be pursued.\n\nThe condition that the Lie derivative of a scalar function $h$ with respect to a vector field $f$ is zero, $L_{f}h = 0$, means that the directional derivative of $h$ in the direction of $f$ is zero. This is equivalent to stating that $h$ is constant along the integral curves of $f$. The two conditions $L_{f_{1}}h = 0$ and $L_{f_{2}}h = 0$ constitute a system of first-order linear partial differential equations for $h$:\n$$\n\\begin{cases} L_{f_{1}}h = (\\partial_{x} + y\\,\\partial_{z})h = \\frac{\\partial h}{\\partial x} + y\\frac{\\partial h}{\\partial z} = 0 \\\\ L_{f_{2}}h = \\partial_{y}h = \\frac{\\partial h}{\\partial y} = 0 \\end{cases}\n$$\nThese equations must hold on a connected open set in $\\mathbb{R}^{3}$.\n\nWe can solve this system directly. The second equation, $\\frac{\\partial h}{\\partial y} = 0$, implies that $h$ is independent of the variable $y$. Thus, $h$ must be a function of $x$ and $z$ only, which we can write as $h(x, y, z) = g(x, z)$ for some smooth function $g: \\mathbb{R}^{2} \\to \\mathbb{R}$.\n\nSubstituting this form of $h$ into the first equation gives:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} g(x, z) + y \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z} g(x, z) = 0\n$$\nThis equation must hold for all $(x, y, z)$ in the specified open set. Let us fix a point $(x_{0}, z_{0})$. The functions $\\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial x}(x_{0}, z_{0})$ and $\\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial z}(x_{0}, z_{0})$ are constants with respect to $y$. The left side of the equation is a linear polynomial in $y$. For this polynomial to be zero for all values of $y$ in an open interval, its coefficients must all be zero.\nEquating the coefficients of the powers of $y$ to zero, we obtain:\n1.  The coefficient of $y^{1}$: $\\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial z}(x, z) = 0$.\n2.  The constant term (coefficient of $y^{0}$): $\\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial x}(x, z) = 0$.\n\nThese two conditions must hold for all $(x, z)$. They imply that the gradient of $g$ is zero everywhere. For a function defined on a connected domain, this means that the function must be a constant. Therefore, $g(x, z) = C$ for some real constant $C$.\nThis leads to the conclusion that any smooth function $h$ satisfying the given conditions must be a constant function, $h(x, y, z) = C$. Consequently, there does not exist any non-constant smooth function $h$ that is a common first integral for $f_{1}$ and $f_{2}$. The problem then asks for the complete general form of all such functions, which is precisely this family of constant functions.\n\nAn alternative, more geometric approach uses Frobenius's theorem. The existence of a non-constant solution $h$ to the system $L_{f_{1}}h = 0$ and $L_{f_{2}}h = 0$ on an open set is equivalent to the integrability of the rank-$2$ distribution $\\mathcal{D} = \\text{span}\\{f_{1}, f_{2}\\}$. A distribution is a choice of a subspace of the tangent space at each point. Here, at each point $p \\in \\mathbb{R}^{3}$, we have the subspace $\\mathcal{D}_{p} = \\text{span}\\{f_{1}(p), f_{2}(p)\\} \\subset T_{p}\\mathbb{R}^{3}$.\nThe Frobenius integrability theorem states that a smooth distribution $\\mathcal{D}$ is integrable if and only if it is involutive. A distribution is involutive if for any two vector fields $X, Y$ belonging to $\\mathcal{D}$, their Lie bracket $[X, Y]$ also belongs to $\\mathcal{D}$. Since $\\mathcal{D}$ is spanned by $f_{1}$ and $f_{2}$, we only need to check if their Lie bracket $[f_{1}, f_{2}]$ is in $\\mathcal{D}$.\n\nThe Lie bracket of two vector fields $X$ and $Y$ is defined by its action on a smooth test function $\\phi$ as $[X, Y](\\phi) = X(Y(\\phi)) - Y(X(\\phi))$.\nLet us compute the Lie bracket of $f_{1} = \\partial_{x} + y\\,\\partial_{z}$ and $f_{2} = \\partial_{y}$:\n$$\n[f_{1}, f_{2}] = [\\partial_{x} + y\\,\\partial_{z}, \\partial_{y}]\n$$\nUsing the linearity and Leibniz rule for the Lie bracket, we have:\n$$\n[f_{1}, f_{2}] = [\\partial_{x}, \\partial_{y}] + [y\\,\\partial_{z}, \\partial_{y}]\n$$\nThe coordinate vector fields commute, so $[\\partial_{x}, \\partial_{y}] = 0$. For the second term, we use the identity $[gX, hY] = gh[X,Y] + g(Xh)Y - h(Yg)X$:\n$$\n[y\\,\\partial_{z}, \\partial_{y}] = [y\\,\\partial_{z}, 1 \\cdot \\partial_{y}] = y(\\partial_{z}(1))\\partial_{y} - 1(\\partial_{y}(y))\\partial_{z} + y \\cdot 1 \\cdot [\\partial_z, \\partial_y]\n$$\nSince $\\partial_z(1)=0$, $\\partial_y(y)=1$, and $[\\partial_z, \\partial_y]=0$, this simplifies to:\n$$\n[y\\,\\partial_{z}, \\partial_{y}] = 0 - 1 \\cdot \\partial_{z} + 0 = -\\partial_{z}\n$$\nThus, the Lie bracket is:\n$$\n[f_{1}, f_{2}] = -\\partial_{z}\n$$\nNow we must check if this resulting vector field, $-\\partial_{z}$, lies in the distribution $\\mathcal{D} = \\text{span}\\{f_{1}, f_{2}\\}$. This would require the existence of scalar functions $c_{1}(x,y,z)$ and $c_{2}(x,y,z)$ such that:\n$$\n-\\partial_{z} = c_{1} f_{1} + c_{2} f_{2}\n$$\nSubstituting the expressions for $f_{1}$ and $f_{2}$:\n$$\n-\\partial_{z} = c_{1}(\\partial_{x} + y\\,\\partial_{z}) + c_{2}\\partial_{y} = c_{1}\\partial_{x} + c_{2}\\partial_{y} + c_{1}y\\,\\partial_{z}\n$$\nThe vectors $\\partial_{x}$, $\\partial_{y}$, and $\\partial_{z}$ form a basis of the tangent space at each point. Equating the components in this basis:\n\\begin{align*} \\text{coeff of } \\partial_{x}: \\quad & 0 = c_{1} \\\\ \\text{coeff of } \\partial_{y}: \\quad & 0 = c_{2} \\\\ \\text{coeff of } \\partial_{z}: \\quad & -1 = c_{1}y \\end{align*}\nSubstituting $c_{1}=0$ into the third equation yields $-1 = 0 \\cdot y = 0$, which is a contradiction.\nTherefore, the vector field $[f_{1}, f_{2}] = -\\partial_{z}$ is not in the span of $\\{f_{1}, f_{2}\\}$. The distribution $\\mathcal{D}$ is not involutive.\n\nBy Frobenius's theorem, since the distribution $\\mathcal{D}$ is not involutive, it is not integrable. The non-integrability of $\\mathcal{D}$ means that there exist no $2$-dimensional submanifolds whose tangent spaces coincide with $\\mathcal{D}$. In the dual formulation, this means there is no non-constant function $h$ whose differential $dh$ annihilates the distribution $\\mathcal{D}$ (i.e., $L_{f_{1}}h=0$ and $L_{f_2}h=0$) on any open set.\nThis confirms the result obtained by direct solution of the PDEs. The only smooth functions $h:\\mathbb{R}^{3}\\to\\mathbb{R}$ that satisfy the given conditions are constant functions.\n\nThe general form of all smooth solutions is $h(x, y, z) = C$, where $C$ is an arbitrary real constant.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{C}\n$$", "id": "2709284"}, {"introduction": "While integrability signifies confinement, its absence is the key to freedom of movementâ€”the essence of controllability.

We use the coordinate representations of the vector fields:\n$$\nf_{1}(x,y) = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad [f_{1},f_{2}](x,y) = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe matrix is formed by these column vectors:\n$$\n\\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe determinant of this matrix is:\n$$\nD(x,y) = \\det\\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} = (1)(1) - (0)(0) = 1\n$$\nThe non-zero value of this determinant confirms that the vectors $f_{1}$ and $[f_{1}, f_{2}]$ are linearly independent for all $(x,y) \\in \\mathbb{R}^{2}$, which is a direct verification of the LARC.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{1}\n$$", "id": "2709305"}]}
