It is objective and phrased using standard, precise terminology of the field. The problem is self-contained, providing all necessary definitions and equations for the required derivation. The structure of $g(x)$ implies $m=n_a$, which is consistent. The problem is well-posed, as it requests a derivation and an explicit expression for a uniquely defined mathematical object under the given constraints. No flaws corresponding to the checklist items are present.\n\nStep 3: Verdict and Action.\nThe problem is valid. A solution will be provided.\n\nThe derivation begins with the closed-loop equality:\n$$\nF_{d}(x)\\nabla H_{d}(x) = F(x)\\nabla H(x) + g(x)u\n$$\nTo analyze this equation under the given state partition $x = (x_a, x_u)$, we partition the vectors and matrices accordingly. The dimension of the input $u$ is $n_a$. The gradient vectors are partitioned as:\n$$\n\\nabla H(x) = \\begin{bmatrix} \\nabla_{x_a} H(x) \\\\ \\nabla_{x_u} H(x) \\end{bmatrix}, \\quad \\nabla H_d(x) = \\begin{bmatrix} \\nabla_{x_a} H_d(x) \\\\ \\nabla_{x_u} H_d(x) \\end{bmatrix}\n$$\nThe structure matrices are partitioned as:\n$$\nF(x) = \\begin{bmatrix} F_{aa}(x)  F_{au}(x) \\\\ F_{ua}(x)  F_{uu}(x) \\end{bmatrix}, \\quad F_d(x) = \\begin{bmatrix} F_{d,aa}(x)  F_{d,au}(x) \\\\ F_{d,ua}(x)  F_{d,uu}(x) \\end{bmatrix}\n$$\nwhere, for example, $F_{au}(x)$ is a matrix of size $n_a \\times n_u$. The input term is:\n$$\ng(x)u = \\begin{bmatrix} I_{n_{a}} \\\\ 0_{n_{u}\\times n_{a}} \\end{bmatrix} u = \\begin{bmatrix} u \\\\ 0_{n_u \\times 1} \\end{bmatrix}\n$$\nSubstituting these partitioned forms into the main equality yields:\n$$\n\\begin{bmatrix} F_{d,aa}(x)  F_{d,au}(x) \\\\ F_{d,ua}(x)  F_{d,uu}(x) \\end{bmatrix} \\begin{bmatrix} \\nabla_{x_a} H_d(x) \\\\ \\nabla_{x_u} H_d(x) \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} F_{aa}(x)  F_{au}(x) \\\\ F_{ua}(x)  F_{uu}(x) \\end{bmatrix} \\begin{bmatrix} \\nabla_{x_a} H(x) \\\\ \\nabla_{x_u} H(x) \\end{bmatrix} + \\begin{bmatrix} u \\\\ 0 \\end{bmatrix}\n$$\nExpanding the matrix products gives a system of two block equations.\n\nThe first block corresponds to the actuated coordinates $x_a$:\n$$\nF_{d,aa}\\nabla_{x_a}H_d + F_{d,au}\\nabla_{x_u}H_d = F_{aa}\\nabla_{x_a}H + F_{au}\\nabla_{x_u}H + u\n$$\nThe second block corresponds to the unactuated coordinates $x_u$:\n$$\nF_{d,ua}\\nabla_{x_a}H_d + F_{d,uu}\\nabla_{x_u}H_d = F_{ua}\\nabla_{x_a}H + F_{uu}\\nabla_{x_u}H\n$$\nThese two equations represent the separated matching conditions.\n\nThe second equation, governing the unactuated dynamics, does not contain the control input $u$. It therefore imposes a structural constraint on the desired Hamiltonian $H_d(x)$ and the desired interconnection matrix $F_d(x)$. This equation is a system of $n_u$ partial differential equations (PDEs) that must be solved to find a suitable $H_d(x)$. These are the **true PDE constraints** of the IDA-PBC problem.\n\nThe first equation, governing the actuated dynamics, contains the control input $u$. This equation is not a constraint on $H_d(x)$. Instead, once $H_d(x)$ and $F_d(x)$ are chosen to satisfy the unactuated PDE constraints and other design objectives (e.g., ensuring the desired equilibrium is a minimum of $H_d$), this first equation can be rearranged to define the state-feedback control law:\n$$\nu = (F_{d,aa}\\nabla_{x_a}H_d + F_{d,au}\\nabla_{x_u}H_d) - (F_{aa}\\nabla_{x_a}H + F_{au}\\nabla_{x_u}H)\n$$\nThis control law, by construction, enforces the desired dynamics on the actuated coordinates.\n\nIf both the actuated and unactuated block equations were imposed as PDEs for the single scalar function $H_d(x)$, the system would be overdetermined. The actuated block equation would add $n_a$ more PDEs, resulting in a total of $n_a + n_u = n$ PDEs for $H_d(x)$. A single scalar field generally cannot satisfy an arbitrary system of more than one PDE. The system is overdetermined because the control input $u$ provides $n_a$ degrees of freedom, which are precisely intended to satisfy the $n_a$ equations of the actuated block. Imposing these as constraints on $H_d(x)$ ignores the available control authority and is therefore an incorrect formulation.\n\nFinally, we derive the compact matching condition. We seek a left-annihilator $g^{\\perp}(x)$ for $g(x)$, which must satisfy $g^{\\perp}(x)g(x) = 0$. Given $g(x) = \\begin{bmatrix} I_{n_a} \\\\ 0_{n_u \\times n_a} \\end{bmatrix}$, let us represent $g^{\\perp}(x)$ in a compatible block form as $g^{\\perp}(x) = \\begin{bmatrix} A  B \\end{bmatrix}$, where $A$ is a matrix of size $k \\times n_a$ and $B$ is a matrix of size $k \\times n_u$. The annihilation condition is:\n$$\ng^{\\perp}(x)g(x) = \\begin{bmatrix} A  B \\end{bmatrix} \\begin{bmatrix} I_{n_a} \\\\ 0 \\end{bmatrix} = A I_{n_a} + B 0 = A = 0_{k \\times n_a}\n$$\nSo, $g^{\\perp}(x)$ must have the form $\\begin{bmatrix} 0_{k \\times n_a}  B \\end{bmatrix}$. The problem specifies that $g^{\\perp}(x)$ has full row rank, which means $k = \\text{rank}(g^{\\perp}) = \\text{rank}(B)$. It also requires that the rows are orthonormal, which implies $g^{\\perp}(x)(g^{\\perp}(x))^{\\top} = I_k$.\n$$\ng^{\\perp}(x)(g^{\\perp}(x))^{\\top} = \\begin{bmatrix} 0  B \\end{bmatrix} \\begin{bmatrix} 0^{\\top} \\\\ B^{\\top} \\end{bmatrix} = B B^{\\top} = I_k\n$$\nThis means that $B$ is a $k \\times n_u$ matrix with orthonormal rows. The image of $g(x)$ is the subspace spanning the first $n_a$ standard basis vectors. The left-annihilator projects onto the orthogonal complement of the image of $g(x)$, which is the subspace spanning the last $n_u$ standard basis vectors. The dimension of this orthogonal complement is $n_u$. To form a basis for this space, we must have $k = n_u$. A matrix $B$ of size $n_u \\times n_u$ satisfying $BB^\\top = I_{n_u}$ is an orthogonal matrix. The simplest choice for $B$ is the identity matrix, $B = I_{n_u}$.\nThis gives the explicit expression for the annihilator:\n$$\ng^{\\perp}(x) = \\begin{bmatrix} 0_{n_u \\times n_a}  I_{n_u} \\end{bmatrix}\n$$\nThis matrix is constant and satisfies all the required properties. Applying it to the rearranged closed-loop equality $F_{d}\\nabla H_{d} - F\\nabla H = gu$ results in:\n$$\ng^{\\perp}(F_{d}\\nabla H_{d} - F\\nabla H) = g^{\\perp}(gu) = (g^{\\perp}g)u = 0 u = 0\n$$\nwhich yields precisely the unactuated PDE constraint equation derived previously.

This manifold is given by $\\mathcal{Z} = \\{(q,p)\\in \\mathbb{R}^{4} \\,:\\, q_{2}=0,\\; p_{2}=0\\}$. The problem states that on this manifold, the dynamics in the coordinate $q_{1}$ are governed by an effective potential energy function, $V_{red}(q_{1})$, which is the restriction of the desired potential $V_{d}(q)$ to $\\mathcal{Z}$.\n\nWe find $V_{red}(q_{1})$ by substituting $q_{2}=0$ into the expression for $V_{d}(q)$:\n$$\nV_{red}(q_{1}) = V_{d}(q_{1}, 0) = k_{1}\\,\\big(1 - \\cos q_{1}\\big) \\;+\\; k_{2}\\,\\big(1 - \\cos(2 q_{1})\\big) \\;+\\; \\tfrac{1}{2}\\,k_{3}\\,(0)^{2}\n$$\n$$\nV_{red}(q_{1}) = k_{1}\\,(1 - \\cos q_{1}) + k_{2}\\,(1 - \\cos(2q_{1}))\n$$\nThe critical points (equilibria) of the reduced system correspond to the stationary points of this potential, which are found where the first derivative of $V_{red}(q_{1})$ with respect to $q_{1}$ is zero. We compute this derivative:\n$$\n\\frac{d V_{red}}{d q_{1}} = \\frac{d}{d q_{1}} \\left[ k_{1}\\,(1 - \\cos q_{1}) + k_{2}\\,(1 - \\cos(2q_{1})) \\right] = k_{1} \\sin q_{1} + 2k_{2} \\sin(2q_{1})\n$$\nUsing the trigonometric double-angle identity $\\sin(2q_{1}) = 2 \\sin q_{1} \\cos q_{1}$, we simplify the derivative:\n$$\n\\frac{d V_{red}}{d q_{1}} = k_{1} \\sin q_{1} + 4k_{2} \\sin q_{1} \\cos q_{1} = (\\sin q_{1})(k_{1} + 4k_{2} \\cos q_{1})\n$$\nSetting this derivative to zero, $\\frac{d V_{red}}{d q_{1}} = 0$, gives the equation for the equilibria:\n$$\n(\\sin q_{1})(k_{1} + 4k_{2} \\cos q_{1}) = 0\n$$\nThis equation is satisfied if at least one of its two factors is zero:\n1.  $\\sin q_{1} = 0$: This condition yields the set of intended, or trivial, equilibria at $q_{1} = n\\pi$ for any integer $n \\in \\mathbb{Z}$. This set includes the desired equilibrium configuration $q_{1} = 0$.\n2.  $k_{1} + 4k_{2} \\cos q_{1} = 0$: This condition can be rearranged to solve for $\\cos q_{1}$:\n    $$\n    \\cos q_{1} = -\\frac{k_{1}}{4k_{2}}\n    $$\n    This second equation is the source of the \"spurious\" equilibria. For real solutions for $q_{1}$ to exist from this equation, the value of the right-hand side must be within the valid range of the cosine function, i.e., in the interval $[-1, 1]$. Thus, spurious equilibria appear if and only if:\n    $$\n    \\left| -\\frac{k_{1}}{4k_{2}} \\right| \\leq 1\n    $$\n    Given that the problem specifies $k_{1}  0$, we can simplify this condition:\n    $$\n    \\frac{k_{1}}{4|k_{2}|} \\leq 1 \\quad \\implies \\quad k_{1} \\leq 4|k_{2}| \\quad \\implies \\quad |k_{2}| \\geq \\frac{k_{1}}{4}\n    $$\n    This demonstrates that if the magnitude of the chosen parameter $k_{2}$ is improperly large, specifically $|k_{2}| \\geq \\frac{k_{1}}{4}$, additional critical points will be created on the zero-dynamics manifold. This completes the first part of the problem.\n\nFor the second part of the problem, we must derive a condition on $k_{2}$ that ensures the absence of these spurious equilibria. This is achieved by requiring that the equation $\\cos q_{1} = -k_{1}/(4k_{2})$ has no real solution. This is guaranteed if the magnitude of the right-hand side is strictly greater than $1$:\n$$\n\\left| -\\frac{k_{1}}{4k_{2}} \\right|  1\n$$\nFollowing the same logic as before, this inequality becomes:\n$$\n\\frac{k_{1}}{4|k_{2}|}  1 \\quad \\implies \\quad k_{1}  4|k_{2}| \\quad \\implies \\quad |k_{2}|  \\frac{k_{1}}{4}\n$$\nThe proposed design adjustment is thus to select the parameter $k_{2}$ such that its magnitude respects this strict inequality relative to $k_{1}$. By doing so, the factor $(k_{1} + 4k_{2} \\cos q_{1})$ can never be zero, and the only equilibria of the reduced system are those determined by $\\sin q_{1} = 0$.\n\nFinally, we are asked to find the largest allowable magnitude $c_{\\star}$ of $k_{2}$ such that for any $k_{2}$ satisfying $|k_{2}|  c_{\\star}$, there are no spurious equilibria. The condition we derived for the absence of such equilibria is precisely of this form: $|k_{2}|  k_{1}/4$. By direct comparison, we identify the value of $c_{\\star}$:\n$$\nc_{\\star} = \\frac{k_{1}}{4}\n$$\nThis value represents the critical threshold for the parameter $k_{2}$. For all $|k_{2}|  c_{\\star}$, the desired potential $V_{d}(q)$ has a single family of critical points on the zero-dynamics manifold at $q_1=n\\pi$, preventing bifurcations that would compromise the stability of the desired operating point.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{k_{1}}{4}}$$", "id": "2704604"}]}
