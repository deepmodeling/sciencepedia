We analyze it under two distinct scenarios.\n\n**Case 1: $\\phi > \\bar d$ (Sufficiently large discontinuous gain)**\nIf $\\phi > \\bar d$, then $\\phi - \\bar d$ is a positive constant. The condition $k|s| + \\phi - \\bar d > 0$ is always satisfied for any $s \\neq 0$, because $k|s| > 0$.\nIn this case, the reaching condition $s\\,\\dot s < 0$ is guaranteed globally. The term $-(\\phi-\\bar d)|s|$ ensures that $\\dot s$ is bounded away from zero as $s \\to 0$, which is a hallmark of finite-time convergence. Specifically, for any $s \\neq 0$:\n$$\ns\\,\\dot s \\le -k s^2 - (\\phi - \\bar d)|s| < 0\n$$\nThis guarantees that $s(t)$ reaches zero in finite time and stays there, thus providing perfect rejection of the disturbance.\n\n**Case 2: $\\phi < \\bar d$ (Insufficient discontinuous gain)**\nIf $\\phi < \\bar d$, then $\\bar d - \\phi$ is a positive constant. The condition $k|s| + \\phi - \\bar d > 0$ can be violated. The condition fails if:\n$$\nk|s| \\le \\bar d - \\phi\n$$\n$$\n|s| \\le \\frac{\\bar d - \\phi}{k}\n$$\nInside this region, the reaching condition $s\\,\\dot s < 0$ is not guaranteed. For a worst-case disturbance, $\\dot s$ can become zero or even change sign, preventing $s$ from reaching zero. Specifically, if $s > 0$ and $d(t) = \\bar d$, we get $\\dot s = -ks - \\phi + \\bar d = -ks + (\\bar d - \\phi)$. If $s = (\\bar d - \\phi)/k$, then $\\dot s = 0$, and the state becomes \"stuck\".\nTherefore, if $\\phi < \\bar d$, trajectories are only guaranteed to enter the set $\\mathcal{S} = \\{s : |s| \\le (\\bar d - \\phi)/k\\}$ and remain within it. This is known as uniform ultimate boundedness (UUB). The set $\\mathcal{S}$ is the residual set or boundary layer.\n\n**Chattering Analysis**\nThe term $-\\phi \\operatorname{sgn}(s)$ in the dynamics of $\\dot s$ is generated by a discontinuous control input. Chattering is the high-frequency oscillation that results from implementing such a discontinuous control law in a real system with non-ideal characteristics (e.g., actuator dynamics, sensor noise, sampling delays). The amplitude of this discontinuous control action is proportional to the gain $\\phi$. Consequently, a larger value of $\\phi$ leads to a more severe chattering effect. The linear term $-ks$ corresponds to a continuous control action and does not directly cause chattering.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n**A. For any $k>0$, if $\\phi > \\bar d$ then $s(t)$ reaches $0$ in finite time for any initial condition, despite $d(t)$, because the discontinuous term enforces the reaching condition near $s=0$ with a strictly negative $s\\,\\dot s$.**\nAs shown in Case 1 of our analysis, if $\\phi > \\bar d$, the condition $s \\dot s \\le -k s^2 - (\\phi-\\bar d)|s| < 0$ holds for all $s \\neq 0$. This ensures that the system trajectories reach $s=0$ in finite time. The reasoning provided is correct: the discontinuous term $-\\phi \\operatorname{sgn}(s)$ overpowers the worst-case disturbance $\\bar d$, enforcing convergence even as $s \\to 0$.\nVerdict: **Correct**\n\n**B. If $\\phi < \\bar d$, then $s(t)$ is uniformly ultimately bounded and eventually satisfies $|s(t)| \\le (\\bar d - \\phi)/k$; thus, increasing $k$ shrinks the residual set size but cannot drive $s$ to zero in steady state for all disturbances of size up to $\\bar d$.**\nOur analysis in Case 2 confirms this statement precisely. The ultimate bound for $|s(t)|$ is indeed $(\\bar d - \\phi)/k$. The size of this residual set is inversely proportional to $k$, so increasing $k$ makes the ultimate bound smaller (improving tracking precision). However, for any finite $k$, this bound is non-zero, and a worst-case disturbance can prevent $s(t)$ from ever reaching exactly zero.\nVerdict: **Correct**\n\n**C. Increasing $\\phi$ enlarges the disturbance rejection margin with respect to $\\bar d$, but it also increases chattering propensity in practice because it raises the magnitude of the discontinuous action.**\nThis statement accurately describes the fundamental trade-off in sliding mode control. \"Disturbance rejection margin\" refers to the ability to handle larger $\\bar d$. For perfect rejection, we need $\\phi > \\bar d$. Increasing $\\phi$ allows this condition to be met for a larger class of disturbances. The second part of the statement correctly identifies that the magnitude of the discontinuous control action is tied to $\\phi$, and increasing it exacerbates chattering.\nVerdict: **Correct**\n\n**D. If $\\phi < \\bar d$, a sufficiently large $k$ still guarantees reaching $s=0$ despite the disturbance, since the linear term dominates the dynamics as $s \\to 0$.**\nThis statement is incorrect. As established in the analysis of option B, if $\\phi < \\bar d$, there is always a non-zero residual set of size $(\\bar d - \\phi)/k$. Increasing $k$ shrinks this set, but does not eliminate it for any finite $k$. The reasoning provided is also flawed. As $s \\to 0$, the linear term $-ks$ diminishes and becomes *weaker*, not dominant. Near the origin, it is the constant-magnitude terms $-\\phi \\operatorname{sgn}(s)$ and $d(t)$ that dictate the dynamics. The linear term dominates only for large $|s|$.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**\n\n**E. Reducing $k$ always reduces chattering without affecting robustness to bounded disturbances, because robustness is determined solely by $\\phi$.**\nThis statement contains two falsehoods. First, robustness is not determined solely by $\\phi$. As shown in Case 2, when $\\phi < \\bar d$, the ultimate bound on tracking error is $(\\bar d - \\phi)/k$. Thus, the gain $k$ directly impacts robustness by determining the size of the boundary layer. A smaller $k$ leads to a larger boundary layer and thus *worse* practical robustness. Second, while chattering is primarily caused by the $\\phi \\operatorname{sgn}(s)$ term, changing $k$ modifies the overall dynamics of approach to the surface, which can have secondary effects on the manifestation of chattering. The primary claim that robustness is independent of $k$ is false.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{ABC}$$", "id": "2745651"}, {"introduction": "Effective control design requires addressing not only the reaching phase but also the intelligent design of the sliding surface itself.
