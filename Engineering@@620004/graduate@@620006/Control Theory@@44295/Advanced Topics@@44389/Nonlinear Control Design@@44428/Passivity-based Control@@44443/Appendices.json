This would mean $|x(t_f)| = c$. At this point, $S(x(t_f))$ would be infinite. However, we have established that $S(x(t_f)) \\le S(x(0))$, where $S(x(0))$ is a finite value. This is a contradiction.\nThe state trajectory cannot reach a point where the storage function is infinite, because this would violate the non-increasing nature of $S(x(t))$.
