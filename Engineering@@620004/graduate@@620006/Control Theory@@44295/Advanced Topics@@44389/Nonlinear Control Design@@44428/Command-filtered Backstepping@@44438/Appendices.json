Comparing the expression $\\sin(x_{1}) + x_{2}$ with the form $f_{1}(x_{1}) + g_{1}(x_{1}) x_{2}$, we unequivocally determine:\n$$\nf_{1}(x_{1}) = \\sin(x_{1})\n$$\n$$\ng_{1}(x_{1}) = 1\n$$\nSimilarly, by inspecting the equation for $\\dot{x}_{2}$, we compare the expression $x_{1}^{2} + \\bigl(1 + x_{1}^{2}\\bigr) u$ with the form $f_{2}(x_{1}, x_{2}) + b(x_{1}, x_{2}) u$. This decomposition yields:\n$$\nf_{2}(x_{1}, x_{2}) = x_{1}^{2}\n$$\n$$\nb(x_{1}, x_{2}) = 1 + x_{1}^{2}\n$$\nFor the system to be in valid strict-feedback form, a critical condition is that the input gain function $b(x_{1}, x_{2})$ must be uniformly bounded away from zero. This requires the existence of a constant $c > 0$ such that the inequality $b(x_{1}, x_{2}) \\ge c$ holds for all states $(x_{1}, x_{2}) \\in \\mathbb{R}^{2}$. This condition is essential for the applicability of control design methodologies such as backstepping, where the control law typically involves an inversion of $b(x_{1}, x_{2})$.\n\nThe problem demands the computation of the largest such constant $c$. This is mathematically equivalent to finding the greatest lower bound, or the infimum, of the function $b(x_{1}, x_{2})$ over its entire domain $\\mathbb{R}^{2}$.\n$$\nc = \\inf_{(x_{1}, x_{2}) \\in \\mathbb{R}^{2}} b(x_{1}, x_{2})\n$$\nThe function we must analyze is $b(x_{1}, x_{2}) = 1 + x_{1}^{2}$. It is immediately apparent that this function depends only on the state variable $x_{1}$ and is independent of $x_{2}$. The analysis therefore simplifies to finding the infimum of the single-variable function $h(x_{1}) = 1 + x_{1}^{2}$ over all $x_{1} \\in \\mathbb{R}$:\n$$\nc = \\inf_{x_{1} \\in \\mathbb{R}} (1 + x_{1}^{2})\n$$\nWe use the fundamental property that the square of any real number is non-negative.

By adding the constant $1$ to both sides of this inequality, we obtain:\n$$\n1 + x_{1}^{2} \\ge 1\n$$\nThis inequality holds for all $x_{1} \\in \\mathbb{R}$, and consequently for all pairs $(x_{1}, x_{2}) \\in \\mathbb{R}^{2}$. The function $b(x_{1}, x_{2}) = 1 + x_{1}^{2}$ thus has a global minimum value of $1$, which occurs along the line where $x_{1} = 0$. Since this minimum value exists, it is equal to the infimum of the function.\nTherefore, the greatest lower bound of $b(x_{1}, x_{2})$ over $\\mathbb{R}^{2}$ is $1$. The largest constant $c$ for which the condition $b(x_{1}, x_{2}) \\ge c$ is satisfied for all states is precisely this infimum.\nWe conclude that the largest such constant is $c=1$.

It is a standard exercise in system analysis and realization. We proceed directly to the solution.\n\nThe given transfer function for the command filter is\n$$\nH(s) = \\frac{\\omega_c^2}{(s+\\omega_c)^2}\n$$\nwhere $\\omega_c > 0$ is the cutoff frequency. We are tasked with three objectives: analyzing the system properties, constructing a state-space realization, and verifying its minimality.\n\nFirst, we address the system properties. The transfer function is a rational function of the complex variable $s$, $H(s) = \\frac{N(s)}{P(s)}$, where the numerator polynomial is $N(s) = \\omega_c^2$ and the denominator polynomial is $P(s) = (s+\\omega_c)^2$.\n\n1) System Properties:\n- **Strictly Proper:** A system is strictly proper if the degree of the denominator polynomial is strictly greater than the degree of the numerator polynomial. Here, $\\deg(P(s)) = 2$ and $\\deg(N(s)) = 0$. Since $2 > 0$, the system is strictly proper. A direct consequence for the state-space realization $(A, B, C, D)$ is that the direct feedthrough term $D$ must be zero, as $D = \\lim_{s \\to \\infty} H(s) = 0$.\n- **Denominator Polynomial and Stability:** Expanding the denominator, we obtain the characteristic polynomial of the system:\n$$\nP(s) = (s+\\omega_c)^2 = s^2 + 2\\omega_c s + \\omega_c^2\n$$\nIn the standard monic form $s^2 + a_1 s + a_0$, the coefficients are identified as $a_1 = 2\\omega_c$ and $a_0 = \\omega_c^2$. The poles of the system are the roots of this polynomial, which are $s_1 = s_2 = -\\omega_c$. Since it is given that $\\omega_c > 0$, both poles are real, negative, and coincident. They lie in the strict left-half of the complex plane ($Re(s) < 0$). This ensures the system is internally stable (and also BIBO stable).\n- **Damping:** The standard form of a second-order denominator is $s^2 + 2\\zeta\\omega_n s + \\omega_n^2$, where $\\zeta$ is the damping ratio and $\\omega_n$ is the natural frequency. By comparing coefficients with $s^2 + 2\\omega_c s + \\omega_c^2$, we identify the natural frequency as $\\omega_n = \\omega_c$ and the damping term as $2\\zeta\\omega_n = 2\\omega_c$. Substituting $\\omega_n = \\omega_c$ gives $2\\zeta\\omega_c = 2\\omega_c$. Since $\\omega_c \\neq 0$, this yields $\\zeta = 1$. A damping ratio of $\\zeta = 1$ is, by definition, a critically damped system.\n\n2) State-Space Realization in Controllable Canonical Form:\nFor a second-order transfer function of the form $H(s) = \\frac{b_1 s + b_0}{s^2 + a_1 s + a_0}$, a standard state-space realization in controllable canonical form is given by the matrices:\n$$\nA = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ -a_0 & -a_1 \\end{pmatrix}, \\quad B = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}, \\quad C = \\begin{pmatrix} b_0 & b_1 \\end{pmatrix}, \\quad D = [0]\n$$\nNote that this form applies when the numerator has degree at most $1$. For our transfer function, $H(s) = \\frac{\\omega_c^2}{s^2 + 2\\omega_c s + \\omega_c^2}$, we have already identified $a_1 = 2\\omega_c$ and $a_0 = \\omega_c^2$. The numerator coefficients are $b_1 = 0$ and $b_0 = \\omega_c^2$. Substituting these values into the canonical form yields the state-space matrices:\n$$\nA = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ -\\omega_c^2 & -2\\omega_c \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\n$$\nB = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\n$$\nC = \\begin{pmatrix} \\omega_c^2 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\n$$\nD = [0]\n$$\nThis is a minimal realization, as the transfer function has no pole-zero cancellations. The system has two poles at $s = -\\omega_c$ and no finite zeros.\n\n3) Verification of Minimality:\nA state-space realization is minimal if and only if it is both completely controllable and completely observable. We verify these properties for the realization derived above.\n- **Controllability:** The controllability matrix $\\mathcal{C}$ for a second-order system is $\\mathcal{C} = \\begin{pmatrix} B & AB \\end{pmatrix}$. We compute the product $AB$:\n$$\nAB = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ -\\omega_c^2 & -2\\omega_c \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ -2\\omega_c \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe controllability matrix is therefore:\n$$\n\\mathcal{C} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 1 & -2\\omega_c \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe system is controllable if $\\mathcal{C}$ has full rank, which is rank $2$ for this $2 \\times 2$ matrix. The rank is full if and only if the determinant is non-zero.\n$$\n\\det(\\mathcal{C}) = (0)(-2\\omega_c) - (1)(1) = -1\n$$\nSince $\\det(\\mathcal{C}) = -1 \\neq 0$, the realization is controllable.\n- **Observability:** The observability matrix $\\mathcal{O}$ for a second-order system is $\\mathcal{O} = \\begin{pmatrix} C \\\\ CA \\end{pmatrix}$. We compute the product $CA$:\n$$\nCA = \\begin{pmatrix} \\omega_c^2 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ -\\omega_c^2 & -2\\omega_c \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & \\omega_c^2 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe observability matrix is therefore:\n$$\n\\mathcal{O} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\omega_c^2 & 0 \\\\ 0 & \\omega_c^2 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe system is observable if $\\mathcal{O}$ has full rank. We compute its determinant:\n$$\n\\det(\\mathcal{O}) = (\\omega_c^2)(\\omega_c^2) - (0)(0) = \\omega_c^4\n$$\nSince $\\omega_c > 0$, it is guaranteed that $\\omega_c^4 > 0$. Thus, $\\det(\\mathcal{O}) \\neq 0$, and the realization is observable.\nBecause the realization is both controllable and observable, it is a minimal realization, as expected.\n\nThe final answer requires the components of the matrices $(A, B, C, D)$ to be presented in a specific row matrix format.\n$A_{11} = 0$, $A_{12} = 1$, $A_{21} = -\\omega_c^2$, $A_{22} = -2\\omega_c$.\n$B_{11} = 0$, $B_{21} = 1$.\n$C_{11} = \\omega_c^2$, $C_{12} = 0$.\n$D = 0$.\nThe ordered vector is $[A_{11}\\;A_{12}\\;A_{21}\\;A_{22}\\;B_{11}\\;B_{21}\\;C_{11}\\;C_{12}\\;D]$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 & -\\omega_c^2 & -2\\omega_c & 0 & 1 & \\omega_c^2 & 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}}\n$$", "id": "2693966"}, {"introduction": "Beyond the procedural steps of control design lies the art of parameter tuning, which requires balancing competing objectives.

The use of a first-order low-pass filter to approximate the derivative of a virtual control is the central tenet of this method. The concepts of time-scale separation, filter bandwidth, phase lag, and noise trade-offs are fundamental to control engineering. The formulation is standard and scientifically sound.\n2.  **Well-Posed**: The problem asks for a design guideline to balance two well-defined, competing objectives: fast tracking versus noise rejection. This is a classic engineering trade-off problem that admits a reasoned, optimal-range solution based on established practice.\n3.  **Objective**: The language is technical, precise, and free of subjective or ambiguous terminology.\n4.  **Completeness and Consistency**: The problem provides all necessary information. The relationship between the plant pole $-a$ and its characteristic frequency $\\omega \\approx a$ is standard. The dynamics of the filter and the stated design goals are consistent and complete.\n5.  **Realism**: The scenario is highly realistic. Approximating complex systems with dominant low-order dynamics and designing controllers that must contend with sensor noise and hardware limitations is a central task in applied control engineering.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\n\nThe problem statement is scientifically sound, well-posed, objective, and self-contained. It presents a standard, non-trivial engineering design problem. It is therefore deemed **valid**. We may proceed with the derivation of the solution.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe core of the problem is to select the filter bandwidth, $\\omega_c$, to balance two conflicting requirements in a command-filtered backstepping architecture.\n\n**Requirement 1: Time-Scale Separation**\nThe command-filtered backstepping method is predicated on the idea that the filter dynamics are significantly faster than the dynamics of the plant subsystem for which the virtual control is designed. This is a principle derived from singular perturbation theory. The filtered command $\\eta(t)$ must track the virtual control $v(t)$ accurately and with minimal delay.\n\nThe plant's dynamics are characterized by a time constant $\\tau_p = 1/a$. The filter's dynamics are characterized by a time constant $\\tau_f = 1/\\omega_c$. For time-scale separation, the filter must be much faster than the plant, which implies its time constant must be much smaller:\n$$\n\\tau_f \\ll \\tau_p \\implies \\frac{1}{\\omega_c} \\ll \\frac{1}{a} \\implies \\omega_c \\gg a\n$$\nIf this condition is not met, the filter introduces significant phase lag, which degrades the stability and performance of the backstepping design. The stability proofs for CFB rely on the error between the virtual control and the filtered command being small. A slow filter violates this assumption.\n\nLet us quantify the effect at the plant's characteristic frequency, $\\omega = a$. The phase lag introduced by the filter is $\\angle G(ja) = -\\arctan(a/\\omega_c)$. For the tracking to be effective, this phase lag must be small. This requires $a/\\omega_c$ to be small, which again leads to the condition $\\omega_c \\gg a$.\n\n**Requirement 2: Noise Attenuation**\nThe problem states that sensor noise is broadband at high frequencies and a larger $\\omega_c$ allows more noise to pass through the filter. The filter is a low-pass filter with transfer function $G(s) = \\omega_c / (s + \\omega_c)$. The power spectral density of the output noise is proportional to $|G(j\\omega)|^2$ integrated over all frequencies. The total noise power at the output, for a white noise input with power spectral density $N_0$, is given by:\n$$\nP_{noise} = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} N_0 |G(j\\omega)|^2 d\\omega = N_0 \\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\frac{\\omega_c^2}{\\omega_c^2 + \\omega^2} d\\omega \\propto N_0 \\omega_c\n$$\nThis confirms the problem's statement that noise power increases with $\\omega_c$. To minimize noise injection into the control loop, $\\omega_c$ should be chosen as small as possible.\n\n**Balancing the Objectives**\nWe must find a compromise. $\\omega_c$ must be significantly larger than $a$ for performance and stability, but not so large that noise corrupts the system. This rules out choices where $\\omega_c \\le a$ and choices where $\\omega_c$ is excessively large.\n\nA common engineering rule of thumb for \"significantly larger\" in time-scale separation is a factor between $3$ and $10$. Let us check the phase lag for this range. If we choose $\\omega_c = \\kappa a$ with $\\kappa \\in [3, 5]$:\n- For $\\kappa=3$, $\\omega_c = 3a$. The phase lag at $\\omega=a$ is $-\\arctan(1/3) \\approx -18.4^\\circ$.\n- For $\\kappa=5$, $\\omega_c = 5a$. The phase lag at $\\omega=a$ is $-\\arctan(1/5) \\approx -11.3^\\circ$.\nThese are small phase lags, generally considered acceptable. They ensure good tracking performance without demanding an impractically high bandwidth, thus providing a reasonable compromise for noise rejection.\n\nFinally, any control design must respect physical hardware limitations. The bandwidth of a controller's command signal, represented here by $\\omega_c$, cannot exceed the bandwidth of the physical components that must execute that command, such as an actuator. If $\\omega_{act}$ is the actuator bandwidth, we must enforce $\\omega_c < \\omega_{act}$. This provides a hard upper bound on the choice of $\\omega_c$.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. Choose $\\omega_c \\approx \\kappa a$ with $\\kappa$ in the range $[3,5]$; if other hardware limits exist (e.g., actuator bandwidth), cap $\\omega_c$ by the smallest such limit.**\nThis option correctly identifies the trade-off. Choosing $\\omega_c$ to be a small multiple (e.g., $3$ to $5$) of $a$ satisfies the time-scale separation requirement ($\\omega_c \\gg a$) while keeping the bandwidth reasonably low to limit noise. The specific range $[3, 5]$ is a standard, sensible engineering heuristic. The inclusion of the constraint imposed by hardware limits is a critical aspect of practical, robust control design. This guideline is comprehensive and correct.\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\n**B. Choose $\\omega_c = a$, so that the filter bandwidth matches the plant dominant pole and does not introduce excessive lag.**\nThis choice directly violates the time-scale separation condition $\\omega_c \\gg a$. At $\\omega=a$, the phase lag is $-\\arctan(a/a) = -45^\\circ$. This is a substantial and unacceptable lag that invalidates the premise of the CFB design and significantly degrades stability margins. The claim that it \"does not introduce excessive lag\" is factually incorrect.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**C. Choose $\\omega_c = a/5$, so that the filter strongly attenuates noise and ensures conservative tracking.**\nThis choice makes the filter dynamics *slower* than the plant dynamics ($\\omega_c < a$). The filtered command $\\eta(t)$ will lag severely behind the virtual control $v(t)$, destroying the backstepping controller's logic and likely leading to instability. While noise attenuation would be excellent, the primary control objective would fail completely.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. Choose $\\omega_c \\gg 50 a$, so that the filter introduces negligible lag and tracks $v(t)$ almost instantaneously.**\nThis choice satisfies the time-scale separation requirement to an extreme degree. While tracking of $v(t)$ would be nearly perfect, it completely neglects the noise-rejection objective. Such a large bandwidth would admit a very large amount of high-frequency sensor noise, which is detrimental to the system. It can cause actuator saturation, excite unmodeled dynamics, and lead to poor overall performance. This is not a \"balance\" but an extreme choice that is impractical in most real-world applications.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2694136"}]}
