The problem is scientifically grounded in control theory, self-contained, and well-posed. We shall proceed with the solution.\n\nThe two parameterizations for the compensator transfer function $C(s)$ are given.\nThe first is the pole-zero form:\n$$\nC_{pz}(s) = \\frac{s+z}{s+p}\n$$\nThe parameters $p$ and $z$ are given as real and positive. The zero of this transfer function is located at $s = -z$, and the pole is located at $s = -p$. Since $p>0$ and $z>0$, the pole and zero lie on the negative real axis, which is consistent with the problem description of a stable system.\n\nThe second is the time-constant form:\n$$\nC_{T\\beta}(s) = \\frac{1+sT}{1+s\\beta T}\n$$\nThe parameters $T$ and $\\beta$ are given as real and positive. To identify the pole and zero locations, we rewrite this expression in the standard pole-zero format:\n$$\nC_{T\\beta}(s) = \\frac{T(s+\\frac{1}{T})}{\\beta T(s+\\frac{1}{\\beta T})} = \\frac{1}{\\beta} \\frac{s+\\frac{1}{T}}{s+\\frac{1}{\\beta T}}\n$$\nFrom this, the zero is located at $s = -1/T$, and the pole is at $s = -1/(\\beta T)$. Since $T>0$ and $\\beta>0$, this pole and zero also lie on the negative real axis.\n\nTo find the mapping between the parameter sets $(p,z)$ and $(T,\\beta)$, we equate the pole and zero locations of a compensator described by these two forms. A compensator has a unique pole and a unique zero.\nEquating the zero locations:\n$$\n-z = -\\frac{1}{T} \\implies z = \\frac{1}{T}\n$$\nEquating the pole locations:\n$$\n-p = -\\frac{1}{\\beta T} \\implies p = \\frac{1}{\\beta T}\n$$\nThese two equations define the relationship between the parameter sets.\n\nThe problem asks to justify the scaling. The two transfer function forms are normalized differently. $C_{pz}(s)$ is normalized to have a high-frequency gain of unity:\n$$\n\\lim_{|s| \\to \\infty} C_{pz}(s) = \\lim_{|s| \\to \\infty} \\frac{s+z}{s+p} = 1\n$$\n$C_{T\\beta}(s)$ is normalized to have a DC gain (at $s=0$) of unity:\n$$\nC_{T\\beta}(0) = \\frac{1+0}{1+0} = 1\n$$\nBy substituting the parameter relationships into $C_{T\\beta}(s)$, we find its relation to $C_{pz}(s)$:\n$$\nC_{T\\beta}(s) = \\frac{1}{\\beta} \\frac{s+\\frac{1}{T}}{s+\\frac{1}{\\beta T}} = \\frac{1}{\\beta} \\frac{s+z}{s+p} = \\frac{1}{\\beta} C_{pz}(s)\n$$\nFrom our parameter relations, $p = z/\\beta$, which implies $\\beta = z/p$. The DC gain of $C_{pz}(s)$ is $C_{pz}(0) = z/p$. The high-frequency gain of $C_{T\\beta}(s)$ is $\\lim_{|s| \\to \\infty} C_{T\\beta}(s) = 1/\\beta$. The scaling factor between the two forms is $\\beta = z/p$, which is the ratio of the DC gain to the high-frequency gain of $C_{pz}(s)$. This justifies the scaling.\n\nNow, we derive the bidirectional mapping explicitly.\nTo express $(T, \\beta)$ in terms of $(p, z)$:\nFrom $z = 1/T$, we solve for $T$:\n$$\nT = \\frac{1}{z}\n$$\nSubstitute this into the expression for $p$:\n$$\np = \\frac{1}{\\beta T} = \\frac{1}{\\beta (1/z)} = \\frac{z}{\\beta}\n$$\nSolving for $\\beta$:\n$$\n\\beta = \\frac{z}{p}\n$$\nTo express $(p, z)$ in terms of $(T, \\beta)$, we use the initial relationships directly:\n$$\nz = \\frac{1}{T}\n$$\n$$\np = \\frac{1}{\\beta T}\n$$\nThis completes the derivation of the four required functions for the mapping.\n\nNext, we derive the constraints on the parameters for the system to be a lag compensator. The problem provides the defining properties.\n1.  The pole is closer to the origin than the zero.\n    The pole location on the complex plane is $-p_0$ and the zero is at $-z_0$. Since they are on the negative real axis, their distances from the origin are $p_0$ and $z_0$ respectively, where $p_0>0$ and $z_0>0$. The condition \"pole is closer to the origin\" translates to the inequality:\n    $$\n    p_0 < z_0\n    $$\n2.  The compensator attenuates higher frequencies relative to lower frequencies.\n    This means the magnitude of the frequency response at high frequencies must be less than its magnitude at low frequencies (DC).\n    $$\n    |\\lim_{|s| \\to \\infty} C(s)| < |C(0)|\n    $$\n\nLet's apply these conditions to both parameterizations.\n\nFor the $(p, z)$ parameterization, $p_0 = p$ and $z_0 = z$.\nThe first condition gives:\n$$\np < z\n$$\nFor the second condition, we evaluate the gains:\n$|C_{pz}(0)| = |z/p| = z/p$ (since $p,z>0$).\n$|\\lim_{|s| \\to \\infty} C_{pz}(s)| = 1$.\nThe inequality becomes $1 < z/p$, which, since $p>0$, is equivalent to $p < z$.\nBoth properties yield the same necessary and sufficient constraint. With the given positivity of parameters, the complete constraint is $0 < p < z$.\n\nFor the $(T, \\beta)$ parameterization, $p_0 = 1/(\\beta T)$ and $z_0 = 1/T$.\nThe first condition $p_0 < z_0$ gives:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{\\beta T} < \\frac{1}{T}\n$$\nSince $T>0$ and $\\beta>0$, we can multiply both sides by $\\beta T$ without changing the inequality direction:\n$$\n1 < \\beta\n$$\nFor the second condition, we evaluate the gains:\n$|C_{T\\beta}(0)| = 1$.\n$|\\lim_{|s| \\to \\infty} C_{T\\beta}(s)| = |\\frac{1+sT}{1+s\\beta T}|_{|s|\\to\\infty} = |\\frac{sT}{s\\beta T}| = \\frac{1}{\\beta}$ (since $\\beta>0$).\nThe inequality becomes $1/\\beta < 1$. Since $\\beta>0$, this is equivalent to $\\beta > 1$.\nBoth properties again yield the same constraint. With the given positivity of $T$, the complete constraint is $T>0$ and $\\beta > 1$.\n\nThe derived constraints are consistent with the mapping: if $0 < p < z$, then $\\beta = z/p > 1$. Conversely, if $\\beta > 1$ and $T > 0$, then $z = 1/T$ and $p = 1/(\\beta T)$ are positive, and $p/z = (1/\\beta T)/(1/T) = 1/\\beta < 1$, which implies $p < z$.\n\nThe four expressions for the final answer are:\n1.  $T(p,z) = \\frac{1}{z}$\n2.  $\\beta(p,z) = \\frac{z}{p}$\n3.  $z(T,\\beta) = \\frac{1}{T}$\n4.  $p(T,\\beta) = \\frac{1}{\\beta T}$", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{1}{z} & \\frac{z}{p} & \\frac{1}{T} & \\frac{1}{\\beta T} \\end{pmatrix}}\n$$", "id": "2716917"}, {"introduction": "A primary application of lag compensation is to improve steady-state accuracy without disrupting a system's carefully tuned transient response.

The problem is scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and does not violate any of the criteria for invalidity. The problem is therefore deemed **valid**, and a solution may be pursued.\n\n**Step 3: Proceed to Solution**\nThe design objective is to augment the preliminary open-loop system, $L_{\\mathrm{pre}}(s)$, with a lag compensator, $C_{\\mathrm{lag}}(s)$, to form a new open-loop system, $L(s) = C_{\\mathrm{lag}}(s)L_{\\mathrm{pre}}(s)$. This must achieve an increase in the position error constant, $K_p$, while preserving the phase margin, $\\phi_m$, and gain-crossover frequency, $\\omega_c$.\n\nThe position error constant, $K_p$, for a type-$0$ unity-feedback system is defined as the DC gain of the open-loop transfer function:\n$$K_p \\equiv \\lim_{s \\to 0} L(s)$$\nFor the preliminary system, the given position error constant is:\n$$K_p^{\\mathrm{pre}} = \\lim_{s \\to 0} L_{\\mathrm{pre}}(s) = 83.0$$\nAfter the introduction of the lag compensator, the new position error constant becomes:\n$$K_p^{\\star} = \\lim_{s \\to 0} L(s) = \\lim_{s \\to 0} \\left( C_{\\mathrm{lag}}(s) L_{\\mathrm{pre}}(s) \\right)$$\nUsing the property of limits, this can be written as:\n$$K_p^{\\star} = \\left( \\lim_{s \\to 0} C_{\\mathrm{lag}}(s) \\right) \\left( \\lim_{s \\to 0} L_{\\mathrm{pre}}(s) \\right)$$\nWe evaluate the DC gain of the lag compensator:\n$$\\lim_{s \\to 0} C_{\\mathrm{lag}}(s) = \\lim_{s \\to 0} \\left( \\beta \\frac{1 + sT}{1 + s\\beta T} \\right) = \\beta \\frac{1 + 0}{1 + 0} = \\beta$$\nTherefore, the relationship between the new and preliminary position error constants is:\n$$K_p^{\\star} = \\beta \\cdot K_p^{\\mathrm{pre}}$$\nThis equation confirms that the purpose of the lag compensator is to increase the DC gain by a factor of $\\beta$.

The fundamental principle of lag compensator design is to provide gain at low frequencies and unity gain at high frequencies, with minimal phase perturbation at the gain-crossover frequency.\n\nThe compensator's frequency response is $C_{\\mathrm{lag}}(j\\omega)$. To leave the crossover frequency $\\omega_c^{\\diamond}$ and phase margin $\\phi_m^{\\star}$ unchanged, the compensator must approximate an ideal gain of $1$ at $\\omega = \\omega_c^{\\diamond}$. This means its magnitude should be close to unity and its phase shift should be close to zero:\n$1$. $|C_{\\mathrm{lag}}(j\\omega_c^{\\diamond})| \\approx 1$\n$2$. $\\arg(C_{\\mathrm{lag}}(j\\omega_c^{\\diamond})) \\approx 0^{\\circ}$\n\nThese conditions are met by placing the compensator's pole at $s = -1/(\\beta T)$ and zero at $s = -1/T$ at frequencies significantly lower than the crossover frequency $\\omega_c^{\\diamond}$. A standard engineering heuristic is to place the zero at least one decade below the crossover frequency, i.e., $1/T \\leq \\omega_c^{\\diamond}/10$.\n\nWhen this condition, $1/T \\ll \\omega_c^{\\diamond}$, is satisfied, it follows that at $\\omega = \\omega_c^{\\diamond}$, we have $\\omega_c^{\\diamond} T \\gg 1$ and $\\omega_c^{\\diamond} \\beta T \\gg 1$.

Thus:\n$$\\arg(C_{\\mathrm{lag}}(j\\omega_c^{\\diamond})) \\approx 90^{\\circ} - 90^{\\circ} = 0^{\\circ}$$\nIn practice, a small negative phase shift (lag) is introduced, which constitutes the \"phase penalty\". By placing the pole-zero pair far below the crossover frequency, this penalty is minimized. This design methodology ensures that the new open-loop gain $|L(j\\omega_c^{\\diamond})| = |C_{\\mathrm{lag}}(j\\omega_c^{\\diamond})||L_{\\mathrm{pre}}(j\\omega_c^{\\diamond})| \\approx 1 \\cdot 1 = 1$, and the new phase margin $\\phi_m^{\\mathrm{new}} = \\phi_m^{\\star} + \\arg(C_{\\mathrm{lag}}(j\\omega_c^{\\diamond}))$ remains approximately equal to $\\phi_m^{\\star}$.\n\nThe problem only requires the value of $\\beta$, which is determined solely by the required improvement in the position error constant.

The statement's claim of proportionality refers only to one component of the error and ignores the dominant component. The conclusion that the error can be made arbitrarily small is false.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**C. For sensor drift $b(t)$ whose dominant frequencies lie well below the closed-loop bandwidth, increasing low-frequency gain via lag compensation increases the transmission of the drift to the plant output, making $e_{\\text{tr}}(t)\\approx b(t)$ over the drift time scales.**\n\nThe part of the tracking error due to sensor drift is $e_{\\text{tr},b}(s) = T(s)b(s) = \\frac{L(s)}{1+L(s)}b(s)$.\nThe problem describes drift $b(t)$ as a signal whose spectral content is at frequencies $\\omega$ well below the closed-loop bandwidth. In this low-frequency range, the purpose of a lag compensator is to make the loop gain magnitude $|L(j\\omega)|$ very large.\nFor frequencies where $|L(j\\omega)| \\gg 1$, the complementary sensitivity function $T(j\\omega)$ has a magnitude very close to $1$:\n$$|T(j\\omega)| = \\left|\\frac{L(j\\omega)}{1+L(j\\omega)}\\right| \\approx 1$$\nIncreasing the low-frequency gain $|L(j\\omega)|$ makes this approximation even better, i.e., $|T(j\\omega)|$ gets even closer to $1$. The transmission from $b(s)$ to the plant output is given by the transfer function $y(s)/b(s) = -T(s)$. So, increasing low-frequency gain increases the magnitude of this transmission at low frequencies, bringing it closer to $1$.\nSince for the drift signal's frequencies, $T(j\\omega) \\approx 1$, we have $e_{\\text{tr},b}(j\\omega) \\approx b(j\\omega)$. In the time domain, this means that for slowly varying drift, $e_{\\text{tr}}(t) \\approx b(t)$ (ignoring the effect of $r(t)$). The statement is a correct description of how high loop-gain at low frequencies makes the system vulnerable to low-frequency sensor noise.\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\n**D. In the absence of sensor bias or drift ($b(t)\\equiv 0$), a lag compensator that increases direct current (DC) loop gain reduces the steady-state tracking error of a type-$0$ plant to step inputs without significantly degrading phase margin if its pole-zero pair is placed well below the crossover frequency.**\n\nThis statement describes the ideal textbook application of a lag compensator.\nWith $b(t)=0$, the tracking error is $e_{\\text{tr}}(s) = \\frac{1}{1+L(s)}r(s)$.\nFor a step input $r(s)=1/s$, the steady-state error for the type-$0$ system is:\n$$e_{\\text{tr,ss}} = \\frac{1}{1+L(0)}$$\nA lag compensator is designed with $z_c > p_c$, so its DC gain $K\\frac{z_c}{p_c}$ is greater than its high-frequency gain $K$. This increases the overall DC loop gain $L(0)$, which directly reduces $e_{\\text{tr,ss}}$.\nThe phase contribution of the lag compensator is $\\angle\\left(K \\frac{j\\omega+z_c}{j\\omega+p_c}\\right)$, which is a negative angle (phase lag) for $\\omega>0$. This lag reduces the phase margin. However, if the pole $p_c$ and zero $z_c$ are chosen to be at frequencies much smaller than the crossover frequency $\\omega_c$ (i.e., $p_c < z_c \\ll \\omega_c$), the phase lag added at $\\omega_c$ is small. Specifically, $\\angle C_{\\text{lag}}(j\\omega_c) = \\arctan(\\omega_c/z_c) - \\arctan(\\omega_c/p_c)$, which approaches $0$ as $z_c/\\omega_c \\to 0$ and $p_c/\\omega_c \\to 0$. Therefore, the phase margin is not significantly degraded. The statement accurately summarizes the principle and correct application of lag compensation.\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\n**E. Introducing integral action inside the controller in addition to the lag stage guarantees elimination of the effect of sensor bias on the steady-state tracking error $e_{\\text{tr}}(t)$ at the plant output.**\n\nIf we introduce integral action, the controller $C(s)$ has a pole at $s=0$. Consequently, the loop gain $L(s)$ has a pole at $s=0$, which means $\\lim_{s\\to 0} |L(s)| = \\infty$.\nLet's re-evaluate the steady-state tracking error for a constant bias $b_0$ and step reference:\n$$e_{\\text{tr,ss}} = \\lim_{s\\to 0} \\left( \\frac{1}{1+L(s)} + \\frac{L(s)}{1+L(s)} b_0 \\right)$$\nSince $\\lim_{s\\to 0} |L(s)| = \\infty$, we have:\n$\\lim_{s\\to 0} \\frac{1}{1+L(s)} = 0$\n$\\lim_{s\\to 0} \\frac{L(s)}{1+L(s)} = \\lim_{s\\to 0} \\frac{1}{1/L(s) + 1} = 1$\nThe resulting steady-state error is:\n$$e_{\\text{tr,ss}} = 0 + (1) \\cdot b_0 = b_0$$\nThe integral action eliminates the steady-state error due to the step reference but fails to eliminate the error due to sensor bias. Instead, it ensures the steady-state tracking error becomes exactly equal to the bias $b_0$. The statement claims elimination of the effect, which is the opposite of what occurs.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\nIn summary, statements A, C, and D are correct.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{ACD}$$", "id": "2716937"}]}
