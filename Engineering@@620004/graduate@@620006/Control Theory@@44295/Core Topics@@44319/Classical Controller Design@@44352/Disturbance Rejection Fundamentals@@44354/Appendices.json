It is a well-posed question in control theory, grounded in fundamental principles, and provides all necessary information for a rigorous derivation. We proceed to the solution.\n\nThe cornerstone of this analysis is the Bode sensitivity integral, which establishes a fundamental limitation on performance for systems with unstable open-loop dynamics. For a linear time-invariant system with a strictly proper, rational loop transfer function $L(s)$ that has poles $\\{p_i\\}$ in the right-half plane, and for which the closed-loop system is internally stable, the sensitivity function $S(s) = \\frac{1}{1 + L(s)}$ must satisfy the following integral constraint:\n$$ \\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\ln|S(j\\omega)| d\\omega = \\pi \\sum_{i} \\text{Re}(p_i) $$\nHere, $\\text{Re}(p_i)$ denotes the real part of the pole $p_i$.\n\nIn this problem, the plant is specified to have a single simple pole in the right-half plane at $s = p = 1$. Since the feedback loop must be internally stable, this unstable pole of the plant must also be a pole of the loop transfer function $L(s)$. Therefore, the set of right-half plane poles of $L(s)$ consists of a single element, $p_1 = 1$. The sum on the right-hand side of the integral equation becomes $\\text{Re}(1) = 1$. The constraint simplifies to:\n$$ \\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\ln|S(j\\omega)| d\\omega = \\pi $$\nThis equation signifies that the total \"area\" under the curve of $\\ln|S(j\\omega)|$ on a linear-log plot is fixed at a positive value, $\\pi$.\n\nWe are given bounds on $|S(j\\omega)|$ over specific frequency intervals. To leverage this information, we partition the integral into three parts:\n$$ \\pi = \\int_{0}^{1} \\ln|S(j\\omega)| d\\omega + \\int_{1}^{6} \\ln|S(j\\omega)| d\\omega + \\int_{6}^{\\infty} \\ln|S(j\\omega)| d\\omega $$\nThe first integral corresponds to the low-frequency range where good disturbance rejection is specified, the third integral corresponds to the high-frequency range where sensitivity is typically kept from amplifying noise, and the second integral corresponds to an intermediate range.\n\nWe analyze the bounds on the first and third integrals.\nFor the low-frequency range, $\\omega \\in [0, 1]$, we are given $|S(j\\omega)| \\leq 0.2$. As the natural logarithm is a monotonically increasing function, this implies $\\ln|S(j\\omega)| \\leq \\ln(0.2)$. An upper bound on the first integral is thus:\n$$ \\int_{0}^{1} \\ln|S(j\\omega)| d\\omega \\leq \\int_{0}^{1} \\ln(0.2) d\\omega = (1 - 0)\\ln(0.2) = \\ln(0.2) $$\nThe value $\\ln(0.2)$ is negative, representing the performance benefit of sensitivity reduction in this band.\n\nFor the high-frequency range, $\\omega \\in [6, \\infty)$, we are given $|S(j\\omega)| \\leq 1$. This implies $\\ln|S(j\\omega)| \\leq \\ln(1) = 0$. The third integral is therefore bounded by:\n$$ \\int_{6}^{\\infty} \\ln|S(j\\omega)| d\\omega \\leq 0 $$\n\nSubstituting these upper bounds into the partitioned integral equation gives:\n$$ \\pi \\leq \\ln(0.2) + \\int_{1}^{6} \\ln|S(j\\omega)| d\\omega + 0 $$\nRearranging this inequality provides a lower bound for the integral over the intermediate frequency range, $\\omega \\in [1, 6]$:\n$$ \\int_{1}^{6} \\ln|S(j\\omega)| d\\omega \\geq \\pi - \\ln(0.2) $$\n\nNow, we relate this integral to the peak sensitivity, $M_s \\triangleq \\sup_{\\omega \\geq 0} |S(j\\omega)|$.

Applying this to the intermediate frequency range, we find an upper bound for the integral over this range:\n$$ \\int_{1}^{6} \\ln|S(j\\omega)| d\\omega \\leq \\int_{1}^{6} \\ln(M_s) d\\omega = (6 - 1)\\ln(M_s) = 5\\ln(M_s) $$\n\nWe now have two inequalities constraining the integral over $\\omega \\in [1, 6]$:\n$$ \\pi - \\ln(0.2) \\leq \\int_{1}^{6} \\ln|S(j\\omega)| d\\omega \\leq 5\\ln(M_s) $$\nThis leads directly to an inequality for $M_s$:\n$$ 5\\ln(M_s) \\geq \\pi - \\ln(0.2) $$\nSolving for $M_s$ yields the rigorous lower bound:\n$$ \\ln(M_s) \\geq \\frac{\\pi - \\ln(0.2)}{5} $$\n$$ M_s \\geq \\exp\\left(\\frac{\\pi - \\ln(0.2)}{5}\\right) $$\nThis result is an expression of the \"waterbed effect\": achieving sensitivity reduction (where $|S| < 1$) over some frequency band must be paid for with a sensitivity increase (where $|S| > 1$) over another band, to satisfy the integral constraint imposed by the unstable pole.\n\nTo complete the problem, we compute the numerical value.

The reference signal is $r(t) = 0$.\n\n1) Derivation of the steady-state relationship.\nIn steady state, we assume that all time-varying signals in the stable closed-loop system converge to constant values. We denote these steady-state values with the subscript `ss`: $y(t) \\to y_{\\mathrm{ss}}$ and $u_{\\mathrm{sat}}(t) \\to u_{\\mathrm{ss}}$ as $t \\to \\infty$. The disturbance $w$ is already a constant.\n\nThe output of a stable, linear time-invariant (LTI) system with transfer function $P(s)$ in response to a constant input $u_{\\mathrm{ss}}$ converges to a steady-state value given by the product of the input and the system's static gain, $P(0)$.

The total measured output $y$ is the sum of the plant output and the disturbance $w$. In steady state, this relationship is:\n$$\ny_{\\mathrm{ss}} = k u_{\\mathrm{ss}} + w\n$$\nThis expression relates the steady-state output $y_{\\mathrm{ss}}$, the steady-state actuator signal $u_{\\mathrm{ss}}$, the disturbance $w$, and the plant static gain $k = P(0)$, as required.\n\n2) Computation of the disturbance threshold $w_{\\star}$.\nThe controller is stated to have integral action. A fundamental property of a controller with integral action in a stable closed-loop system is that it drives the steady-state error to zero, provided the system's actuators are not saturated. For this regulator problem, the error is $e(t) = r(t) - y(t) = 0 - y(t) = -y(t)$.\nFor the steady-state error $e_{\\mathrm{ss}}$ to be zero, the steady-state output $y_{\\mathrm{ss}}$ must be zero. This is the condition for full disturbance rejection.\nSetting $y_{\\mathrm{ss}} = 0$ in the expression from part 1, we find the required steady-state actuator signal to achieve perfect rejection:\n$$\n0 = k u_{\\mathrm{ss}} + w \\implies u_{\\mathrm{ss}} = -\\frac{w}{k}\n$$\nThe actuator signal $u_{\\mathrm{ss}}$ is, however, subject to the saturation limit $|u_{\\mathrm{ss}}| \\leq u_{\\max}$. Therefore, full disturbance rejection is only possible if the required signal is within these bounds:\n$$\n\\left| -\\frac{w}{k} \\right| \\leq u_{\\max}\n$$\nGiven that $k > 0$ and $u_{\\max} > 0$, this inequality simplifies to:\n$$\n|w| \\leq k u_{\\max}\n$$\nThe disturbance threshold $w_{\\star}$ is the boundary of this region. It represents the maximum magnitude of the disturbance that can be fully rejected. Disturbances with a magnitude $|w| > w_{\\star}$ will cause the actuator to saturate, preventing the controller from driving the steady-state output to zero. Thus, the threshold is defined as:\n$$\nw_{\\star} = k u_{\\max}\n$$\nUsing the provided numerical values $k = 2.5$ and $u_{\\max} = 0.8$:\n$$\nw_{\\star} = (2.5) \\cdot (0.8) = 2.0\n$$\n\n3) Computation of the steady-state output $y_{\\mathrm{ss}}$ for $w = 2.6$.\nWe are given a constant disturbance $w = 2.6$. We first compare its magnitude to the threshold $w_{\\star}$:\n$$\n|w| = 2.6 > w_{\\star} = 2.0\n$$\nSince the disturbance magnitude exceeds the threshold, the actuator will saturate in steady state, and the disturbance will not be fully rejected, i.e., $y_{\\mathrm{ss}} \\neq 0$.\nThe disturbance is positive ($w = 2.6 > 0$). To counteract this, the controller will attempt to generate a negative control signal. The required (unsaturated) steady-state actuator signal would be:\n$$\nu_{\\mathrm{req}} = -\\frac{w}{k} = -\\frac{2.6}{2.5} = -1.04\n$$\nThe saturation limit is $u_{\\max} = 0.8$. Since $|u_{\\mathrm{req}}| = 1.04 > u_{\\max}$, the physical actuator will be unable to provide the required signal. It will saturate at its negative limit. The actual steady-state actuator signal will therefore be:\n$$\nu_{\\mathrm{ss}} = -u_{\\max} = -0.8\n$$\nWith the actuator saturated at this value, the steady-state output $y_{\\mathrm{ss}}$ can be calculated using the relationship from part 1:\n$$\ny_{\\mathrm{ss}} = k u_{\\mathrm{ss}} + w\n$$\nSubstituting the known values $k = 2.5$, $u_{\\mathrm{ss}} = -0.8$, and $w = 2.6$:\n$$\ny_{\\mathrm{ss}} = (2.5) \\cdot (-0.8) + 2.6 = -2.0 + 2.6 = 0.6\n$$\nThe resulting steady-state output is $y_{\\mathrm{ss}} = 0.6$.
