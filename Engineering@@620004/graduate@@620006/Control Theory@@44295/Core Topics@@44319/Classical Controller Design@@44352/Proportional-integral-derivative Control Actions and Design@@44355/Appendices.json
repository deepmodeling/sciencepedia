This is a standard procedure in classical control theory, grounded in the analysis of the closed-loop characteristic equation using the Routh-Hurwitz stability criterion.\n\nThe system consists of a plant with transfer function $G(s) = \\dfrac{1}{s(s+1)}$ and a Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) controller $C(s) = K_p + \\dfrac{K_i}{s} + K_d s$. The closed-loop transfer function for a unity negative-feedback system is given by $T(s) = \\dfrac{C(s)G(s)}{1 + C(s)G(s)}$. The stability of the system is determined by the locations of the closed-loop poles, which are the roots of the characteristic equation $1 + C(s)G(s) = 0$.\n\nFirst, we establish the characteristic equation. The loop transfer function $L(s)$ is the product of the controller and plant transfer functions:\n$$L(s) = C(s)G(s) = \\left( K_p + \\frac{K_i}{s} + K_d s \\right) \\left( \\frac{1}{s(s+1)} \\right)$$\nTo simplify, we find a common denominator for the controller terms:\n$$C(s) = \\frac{K_p s + K_i + K_d s^2}{s}$$\nThus, the loop transfer function is:\n$$L(s) = \\left( \\frac{K_d s^2 + K_p s + K_i}{s} \\right) \\left( \\frac{1}{s(s+1)} \\right) = \\frac{K_d s^2 + K_p s + K_i}{s^2(s+1)}$$\nThe characteristic equation is $1 + L(s) = 0$:\n$$1 + \\frac{K_d s^2 + K_p s + K_i}{s^2(s+1)} = 0$$\nTo find the characteristic polynomial, we clear the denominator:\n$$s^2(s+1) + K_d s^2 + K_p s + K_i = 0$$\n$$s^3 + s^2 + K_d s^2 + K_p s + K_i = 0$$\nGrouping the terms by powers of $s$, we obtain the third-order characteristic polynomial $P(s)$:\n$$P(s) = s^3 + (1+K_d)s^2 + K_p s + K_i = 0$$\nThe coefficients of the polynomial are:\n$a_3 = 1$\n$a_2 = 1+K_d$\n$a_1 = K_p$\n$a_0 = K_i$\n\nFor the system to be stable, all roots of $P(s)$ must lie strictly in the open left half of the complex plane. The Routh-Hurwitz criterion provides the necessary and sufficient conditions for this. The criterion requires constructing the Routh array from the polynomial coefficients. For a third-order polynomial, the array is:\n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{c|cc}\ns^3 & a_3 & a_1 \\\\\ns^2 & a_2 & a_0 \\\\\ns^1 & b_1 & 0 \\\\\ns^0 & c_1 & 0\n\\end{array}\n$$\n\nSubstituting our coefficients:\n$$\n\\begin{array}{c|cc}\ns^3 & 1 & K_p \\\\\ns^2 & 1+K_d & K_i \\\\\ns^1 & b_1 & 0 \\\\\ns^0 & c_1 & 0\n\\end{array}\n$$\n\nThe elements $b_1$ and $c_1$ are calculated as follows:\n$$b_1 = \\frac{a_2 a_1 - a_3 a_0}{a_2} = \\frac{(1+K_d)K_p - (1)K_i}{1+K_d}$$\n$$c_1 = \\frac{b_1 a_0 - a_2(0)}{b_1} = a_0 = K_i$$\n\nThe Routh-Hurwitz criterion states that the number of roots of the polynomial in the right-half plane is equal to the number of sign changes in the first column of the Routh array. For strict stability, there must be no roots in the right-half plane and no roots on the imaginary axis. This is achieved if and only if all elements in the first column of the array have the same sign. Since the first element, $a_3=1$, is positive, all subsequent elements in the first column must also be positive.\n\nThe elements of the first column are $1$, $1+K_d$, $b_1$, and $K_i$. This leads to the following set of inequalities for stability:\n1. $1+K_d > 0$\n2. $b_1 = \\dfrac{(1+K_d)K_p - K_i}{1+K_d} > 0$\n3. $K_i > 0$\n\nLet us analyze each condition:\nFrom condition (1): $K_d > -1$. This ensures the coefficient of $s^2$ is positive. It is a necessary condition for stability as all polynomial coefficients must be positive for a stable system.\n\nFrom condition (3): $K_i > 0$. This ensures the constant term of the polynomial is positive, which is also a necessary condition. Physically, it means that a non-zero integral action is required, and its sign must be positive to counteract steady-state errors correctly for this plant.\n\nFrom condition (2): Since we already require $1+K_d > 0$ from the first condition, the inequality for $b_1 > 0$ simplifies to its numerator being positive:\n$(1+K_d)K_p - K_i > 0 \\implies K_i  K_p(1+K_d)$.\nThis inequality couples all three PID gains. It defines the main stability boundary. Note that for this inequality to hold, given that $K_i > 0$ and $1+K_d > 0$, it is necessary that $K_p(1+K_d) > K_i > 0$, which implies $K_p > 0$. Therefore, the condition $K_p > 0$ is implicitly required, which is consistent with the necessary condition that all polynomial coefficients be positive.\n\nIn summary, the necessary and sufficient conditions for the closed-loop system to be strictly stable are the simultaneous satisfaction of these three inequalities:\n$K_d > -1$\n$K_i > 0$\n$K_p(1+K_d) > K_i$\nThese conditions define an open region in the three-dimensional parameter space $(K_p, K_i, K_d)$. The Routh-Hurwitz criterion is a complete test for the location of roots relative to the imaginary axis, so these conditions are both necessary and sufficient.\n\nThe boundary of this stability region is where one of these strict inequalities becomes an equality. The surfaces bounding the stable region are:\n- $K_d = -1$ (a plane)\n- $K_i = 0$ (a plane)\n- $K_i = K_p(1+K_d)$ (a surface)\n\nThe problem asks for the nontrivial stability boundary surface $K_i = f(K_p, K_d)$ that couples the three gains. This corresponds to the third condition becoming an equality, which makes the $s^1$ row element $b_1$ equal to zero. When $b_1=0$, there are roots on the imaginary axis, signifying marginal stability, the cusp of instability. This is the boundary where oscillatory instability begins. The analytic expression for this boundary is derived directly from the third inequality:\n$$K_i = K_p(1+K_d)$$\nThis is the required function $f(K_p, K_d)$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{K_p(1+K_d)}$$", "id": "2734751"}, {"introduction": "A common design temptation is to use a controller zero to cancel an undesirable plant pole, aiming for a simplified closed-loop response.

It is a standard exercise in robust control theory concerning the sensitivity of closed-loop poles to parameter uncertainty. We may therefore proceed directly to the derivation.\n\nThe system under consideration is a single-input single-output (SISO) linear time-invariant (LTI) plant in a unity feedback configuration with a Proportional-Integral (PI) controller. The plant transfer function is given by\n$$G(s;\\Delta) = \\dfrac{K}{(s+a+\\Delta)(s+b)}$$\nwhere $K>0$, $a>0$, $b>0$, and $b \\neq a$. The parameter $\\Delta$ represents a small, real uncertainty in the location of the nominal plant pole at $s=-a$. The controller is\n$$C(s) = k_c \\dfrac{s+a}{s}$$\nwith gain $k_c$. This controller has a zero at $s=-a$, intended to cancel the nominal plant pole at $s=-a$.\n\nThe closed-loop poles of the system are the roots of the characteristic equation, which for a unity feedback system is given by $1 + L(s;\\Delta) = 0$, where $L(s;\\Delta) = C(s)G(s;\\Delta)$ is the open-loop transfer function.\n\nFirst, we construct the open-loop transfer function:\n$$L(s;\\Delta) = C(s)G(s;\\Delta) = \\left( k_c \\dfrac{s+a}{s} \\right) \\left( \\dfrac{K}{(s+a+\\Delta)(s+b)} \\right) = \\dfrac{k_c K (s+a)}{s(s+a+\\Delta)(s+b)}$$\nThe characteristic equation is then:\n$$1 + \\dfrac{k_c K (s+a)}{s(s+a+\\Delta)(s+b)} = 0$$\nTo find the roots, we clear the denominator, yielding a polynomial equation whose roots are the closed-loop poles:\n$$s(s+a+\\Delta)(s+b) + k_c K (s+a) = 0$$\nLet us define the characteristic polynomial as a function of the complex variable $s$ and the parameter $\\Delta$:\n$$P(s, \\Delta) \\equiv s(s+b)(s+a+\\Delta) + k_c K (s+a) = 0$$\n\nIn the nominal case where there is no uncertainty ($\\Delta=0$), the characteristic equation becomes:\n$$P(s, 0) = s(s+b)(s+a) + k_c K (s+a) = 0$$\nThis equation can be factored by extracting the common term $(s+a)$:\n$$(s+a) [s(s+b) + k_c K] = 0$$\nThe roots are $s=-a$ and the roots of the quadratic equation $s^2 + bs + k_c K = 0$. This confirms that when $\\Delta=0$, there is a closed-loop pole at $s=-a$, which we denote as $s^{\\star}(0)=-a$. The controller zero perfectly cancels the plant pole.\n\nWhen uncertainty is present ($\\Delta \\neq 0$), the cancellation is no longer perfect. The term $(s+a)$ is not a common factor of $P(s, \\Delta)$. However, for small $\\Delta$, there will be a root of $P(s, \\Delta)$, which we call $s^{\\star}(\\Delta)$, that is close to $-a$.

The reference signal $r(t)$ is filtered by $F(s)$ to produce $R'(s) = F(s)R(s)$. This signal enters the unity-feedback loop. The output $Y(s)$ is given by:\n$$\nY(s) = \\frac{C(s)G(s)}{1 + C(s)G(s)} R'(s)\n$$\nBy definition, the closed-loop complementary sensitivity function without the prefilter is $T_0(s) = \\frac{C(s)G(s)}{1 + C(s)G(s)}$.

The input is a unit step, $r(t) = u(t)$, where $u(t)$ is the Heaviside step function. A sufficient condition for the step response of a linear time-invariant (LTI) system to be monotonic is that its impulse response, $t(t) = \\mathcal{L}^{-1}\\{T(s)\\}$, is non-negative for all $t \\ge 0$.\nThe overall impulse response is the convolution of the impulse responses of the constituent systems:\n$$\nt(t) = \\mathcal{L}^{-1}\\{T_0(s) F(s)\\} = t_0(t) * f(t)\n$$\nwhere $t_0(t) = \\mathcal{L}^{-1}\\{T_0(s)\\}$ and $f(t) = \\mathcal{L}^{-1}\\{F(s)\\}$.\nThe prefilter is given as $F(s) = \\frac{1}{\\tau_f s + 1}$, with $\\tau_f > 0$.
