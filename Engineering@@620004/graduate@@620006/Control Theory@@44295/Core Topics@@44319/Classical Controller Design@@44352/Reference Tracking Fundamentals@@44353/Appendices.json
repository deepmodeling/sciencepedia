It presents a standard second-order system and asks for analysis of its step response characteristics, specifically the tracking error. To apply the Final Value Theorem, the poles of $sE(s)$ must lie in the open left-half of the complex plane. The poles of $T(s)$ are the roots of the characteristic equation $s^2 + 3s + 10 = 0$. These roots are $s = \\frac{-3 \\pm \\sqrt{3^2 - 4(1)(10)}}{2} = -\\frac{3}{2} \\pm j\\frac{\\sqrt{31}}{2}$. Both poles have a negative real part, $-\\frac{3}{2}$, so the closed-loop system is stable. The error transform is $E(s) = (1-T(s))R(s) = \\frac{s^2+3s}{s^2+3s+10} \\frac{1}{s} = \\frac{s+3}{s^2+3s+10}$. The poles of $sE(s)$ are the same as the poles of $T(s)$, which are stable. Therefore, the Final Value Theorem is applicable. The problem is self-contained, objective, and well-posed. No scientific or logical flaws are present.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. We proceed with the solution.\n\nThe tracking error in the Laplace domain is defined as $E(s) = R(s) - Y(s)$. Given that $Y(s) = T(s)R(s)$, we can write the error as:\n$$E(s) = R(s) - T(s)R(s) = \\bigl(1 - T(s)\\bigr)R(s)$$\nThe input is a unit step, so $R(s) = 1/s$. Substituting the given transfer function $T(s)$:\n$$E(s) = \\left(1 - \\frac{10}{s^{2} + 3s + 10}\\right) \\frac{1}{s} = \\left(\\frac{s^{2} + 3s + 10 - 10}{s^{2} + 3s + 10}\\right) \\frac{1}{s}$$\n$$E(s) = \\left(\\frac{s^{2} + 3s}{s^{2} + 3s + 10}\\right) \\frac{1}{s} = \\frac{s(s+3)}{s(s^{2} + 3s + 10)} = \\frac{s+3}{s^{2} + 3s + 10}$$\n\nFirst, we determine the steady-state error, $e_{ss}$, using the Final Value Theorem. As established during validation, the theorem is applicable.\n$$e_{ss} = \\lim_{t \\to \\infty} e(t) = \\lim_{s \\to 0} sE(s)$$\n$$e_{ss} = \\lim_{s \\to 0} s \\left(\\frac{s+3}{s^{2} + 3s + 10}\\right) = \\frac{0 \\cdot (0+3)}{0^{2} + 3(0) + 10} = \\frac{0}{10} = 0$$\nThe steady-state error is $0$.\n\nNext, we find the minimum value of the error function $e(t)$. This requires finding the inverse Laplace transform of $E(s)$. We start by completing the square in the denominator:\n$$s^{2} + 3s + 10 = \\left(s^{2} + 3s + \\left(\\frac{3}{2}\\right)^{2}\\right) - \\left(\\frac{3}{2}\\right)^{2} + 10 = \\left(s + \\frac{3}{2}\\right)^{2} + 10 - \\frac{9}{4} = \\left(s + \\frac{3}{2}\\right)^{2} + \\frac{31}{4}$$\nNow, we rewrite $E(s)$ to match standard Laplace transform pairs of damped sinusoids:\n$$E(s) = \\frac{s+3}{\\left(s + \\frac{3}{2}\\right)^{2} + \\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{31}}{2}\\right)^{2}}$$\nWe adjust the numerator to isolate the cosine and sine components:\n$$E(s) = \\frac{\\left(s + \\frac{3}{2}\\right) + \\frac{3}{2}}{\\left(s + \\frac{3}{2}\\right)^{2} + \\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{31}}{2}\\right)^{2}} = \\frac{s + \\frac{3}{2}}{\\left(s + \\frac{3}{2}\\right)^{2} + \\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{31}}{2}\\right)^{2}} + \\frac{\\frac{3}{2}}{\\left(s + \\frac{3}{2}\\right)^{2} + \\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{31}}{2}\\right)^{2}}$$\nThe first term corresponds to $\\mathcal{L}^{-1}\\left\\{\\frac{s+a}{(s+a)^2 + \\omega^2}\\right\\} = \\exp(-at)\\cos(\\omega t)$.

The times of the extrema are $t_n = \\frac{n\\pi}{\\omega_d} = \\frac{2n\\pi}{\\sqrt{31}}$.\nWe evaluate $e(t)$ at these times. At $t_n$, we have $\\sin(\\omega_d t_n) = 0$ and $\\cos(\\omega_d t_n) = (-1)^n$.\n$$e(t_n) = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{3}{2} \\frac{2n\\pi}{\\sqrt{31}}\\right) \\left[ (-1)^n + 0 \\right] = (-1)^n \\exp\\left(-\\frac{3n\\pi}{\\sqrt{31}}\\right)$$\nFor $n=0$, $e(0)=1$. For $n=1$, $e(t_1) = -\\exp\\left(-\\frac{3\\pi}{\\sqrt{31}}\\right)$. For $n=2$, $e(t_2) = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{6\\pi}{\\sqrt{31}}\\right)$.\nThe function is a decaying oscillation. The smallest (most negative) value occurs at the first negative extremum, which corresponds to $n=1$.\nThe minimum value of $e(t)$ is $-\\exp\\left(-\\frac{3\\pi}{\\sqrt{31}}\\right)$.\n\nFinally, we provide interpretation. The standard form of a second-order system is $T(s) = \\frac{\\omega_n^2}{s^2 + 2\\zeta\\omega_n s + \\omega_n^2}$.\nComparing with $T(s) = \\frac{10}{s^2 + 3s + 10}$, we find:\n- Natural frequency: $\\omega_n^2 = 10 \\implies \\omega_n = \\sqrt{10} \\text{ rad/s}$.\n- Damping ratio: $2\\zeta\\omega_n = 3 \\implies \\zeta = \\frac{3}{2\\omega_n} = \\frac{3}{2\\sqrt{10}}$.\nSince $\\zeta = \\frac{3}{2\\sqrt{10}} \\approx 0.474  1$, the system is underdamped, which explains the oscillatory nature of the error.\nThe steady-state error of $0$ is due to the fact that the DC gain of the closed-loop system is $T(0) = \\frac{10}{10} = 1$. For a unit step input $r(t)$, the steady-state output is $y_{ss} = \\lim_{s \\to 0} s Y(s) = \\lim_{s \\to 0} s T(s) \\frac{1}{s} = T(0) = 1$. Thus, $e_{ss} = r_{ss} - y_{ss} = 1 - 1 = 0$.\nThe minimum error corresponds to the maximum output (peak overshoot). The overshoot in the output $y(t)$ causes a corresponding undershoot in the error $e(t) = 1 - y(t)$. The magnitude of this first undershoot is given by the standard formula $\\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\zeta \\pi}{\\sqrt{1-\\zeta^2}}\\right)$. Let us verify this with our derived parameters:\n$$\\frac{\\zeta\\pi}{\\sqrt{1-\\zeta^2}} = \\frac{\\frac{3}{2\\sqrt{10}}\\pi}{\\sqrt{1 - \\frac{9}{40}}} = \\frac{\\frac{3}{2\\sqrt{10}}\\pi}{\\sqrt{\\frac{31}{40}}} = \\frac{\\frac{3}{2\\sqrt{10}}\\pi}{\\frac{\\sqrt{31}}{2\\sqrt{10}}} = \\frac{3\\pi}{\\sqrt{31}}$$\nThus, the minimum error is $-\\exp\\left(-\\frac{3\\pi}{\\sqrt{31}}\\right)$, which precisely matches our direct calculation.

The system is a single-input single-output (SISO) linear time-invariant (LTI) plant with a transfer function $G(s)$ that has a transmission zero at $s=z$, where $z$ is a positive real number ($z > 0$).

Therefore:\n   $$ e_{ss} = 0 $$\n\n4. For $n > 2$: The term $sL(s)$ behaves as $s \\cdot \\dfrac{K}{s^n} = \\dfrac{K}{s^{n-1}}$ for small $s$, where $n-1 \\ge 2$. This term goes to infinity as $s \\to 0$ even faster than for the $n=2$ case. The denominator of the expression for $e_{ss}$ goes to infinity, and thus $e_{ss}=0$.\n\nFrom this analysis, the necessary and sufficient condition for the steady-state tracking error to a ramp input to be zero is that the loop transfer function $L(s)$ must contain at least two integrators, i.e., $n \\ge 2$.\n\nSecond, we apply the Internal Model Principle (IMP). The IMP states that for perfect asymptotic tracking of a reference signal, the feedback loop must contain a model of the reference signal's generator, assuming the closed-loop system is stable. The reference signal $r(t)=t$ has a Laplace transform $R(s) = \\dfrac{1}{s^2}$. The poles of $R(s)$ define the dynamics of the generator. Here, there is a double pole at $s=0$. Therefore, the internal model required is a double integrator, represented by the transfer function $\\dfrac{1}{s^2}$. This model must be present in the loop transfer function $L(s) = C(s)G(s)$.\n\nThe given plant is $G(s) = \\dfrac{2}{s^2+3s+2} = \\dfrac{2}{(s+1)(s+2)}$. This plant has no poles at $s=0$, meaning it has no intrinsic integrators. Consequently, the controller $C(s)$ must provide the entire internal model. The controller must contain the term $\\dfrac{1}{s^2}$. The minimal order of the internal model required in the controller is therefore $n_{\\mathrm{im}} = 2$.\n\nThird, we propose a minimal-order proper controller that embeds this model and can stabilize the loop.\nBased on the IMP, the controller must have the form $C(s) = \\dfrac{1}{s^2} \\tilde{C}(s)$, where $\\tilde{C}(s)$ is a sub-controller designed to ensure stability of the closed-loop system.\nThe loop transfer function is $L(s) = C(s)G(s) = \\dfrac{\\tilde{C}(s)}{s^2} \\dfrac{2}{s^2+3s+2}$.\nThe closed-loop characteristic equation is $1+L(s)=0$:\n$$ 1 + \\dfrac{2\\tilde{C}(s)}{s^2(s^2+3s+2)} = 0 \\implies s^2(s^2+3s+2) + 2\\tilde{C}(s) = 0 $$\n$$ s^4 + 3s^3 + 2s^2 + 2\\tilde{C}(s) = 0 $$\nWe need to select a minimal-order $\\tilde{C}(s)$ that can stabilize this fourth-order system. A simple proportional gain $\\tilde{C}(s) = K$ results in the polynomial $s^4 + 3s^3 + 2s^2 + 2K = 0$. The Routh-Hurwitz criterion shows this system is unstable for any $K>0$ due to a zero coefficient for the $s^1$ term.\n\nLet us try a first-order compensator, $\\tilde{C}(s) = K_d s + K_p$. This corresponds to a proportional-derivative (PD) type action. The characteristic equation becomes:\n$$ s^4 + 3s^3 + 2s^2 + 2(K_d s + K_p) = 0 \\implies s^4 + 3s^3 + 2s^2 + 2K_d s + 2K_p = 0 $$\nFor stability, all coefficients must be positive, which requires $K_d > 0$ and $K_p > 0$. The Routh-Hurwitz stability criterion for this polynomial yields further conditions:\n1. $2-\\frac{2}{3}K_d > 0 \\implies K_d  3$.\n2. $(2-\\frac{2}{3}K_d)(2K_d) - 6K_p > 0 \\implies K_p  \\frac{K_d}{3}(2-\\frac{2}{3}K_d)$.\nIt is possible to select positive values for $K_p$ and $K_d$ that satisfy these inequalities (e.g., $K_d = 1.5$ and $K_p = 0.2$). Therefore, a controller of this structure can, in principle, stabilize the closed-loop system.\n\nThe proposed controller is $C(s) = \\dfrac{K_d s + K_p}{s^2}$. This controller has an order of $2$. It is a proper (specifically, strictly proper) transfer function since the degree of the numerator ($1$) is less than the degree of the denominator ($2$). The order is minimal because the controller must contain the second-order internal model $\\dfrac{1}{s^2}$.\n\nJustification:\n- Low-frequency behavior: For small $s$, $L(s) = \\dfrac{K_d s + K_p}{s^2} \\dfrac{2}{s^2+3s+2} \\approx \\dfrac{K_p}{s^2} \\dfrac{2}{2} = \\dfrac{K_p}{s^2}$. The loop behaves as a double integrator at low frequencies, which confirms the condition for zero steady-state error to a ramp.\n- Stability: As shown via Routh-Hurwitz analysis of the characteristic polynomial $s^4 + 3s^3 + 2s^2 + 2K_d s + 2K_p = 0$, there exists a non-empty set of parameters $(K_p, K_d)$ that guarantee closed-loop stability.\n\nThe minimal order of the internal model to be embedded in the controller to ensure zero steady-state error for a ramp input is $2$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{2}$$", "id": "2737822"}]}
