It is a well-posed, scientifically grounded problem in linear control theory, free of any ambiguities or contradictions.\n\nThe analysis proceeds in two parts as required. First, the unit step response $y(t)$ for the critically damped case ($\\zeta = 1$) is derived from first principles. Second, the derived expression for $y(t)$ is used to analytically determine if overshoot is possible.\n\nPart 1: Derivation of the Step Response $y(t)$\n\nThe input-output relationship for a linear time-invariant (LTI) system in the Laplace domain is given by:\n$$\nY(s) = G(s) U(s)\n$$\nwhere $Y(s)$ is the Laplace transform of the output $y(t)$, $G(s)$ is the system's transfer function, and $U(s)$ is the Laplace transform of the input $u(t)$.\n\nThe system is subjected to a unit step input, $u(t) = 1$ for $t \\ge 0$. The Laplace transform of the unit step function is, by definition,\n$$\nU(s) = \\mathcal{L}\\{u(t)\\} = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} (1) e^{-st} dt = \\left[ -\\frac{1}{s}e^{-st} \\right]_{0}^{\\infty} = 0 - \\left(-\\frac{1}{s}\\right) = \\frac{1}{s}\n$$\nfor $\\text{Re}(s) > 0$.\n\nThe standard second-order transfer function is given as:\n$$\nG(s) = \\frac{\\omega_n^{2}}{s^{2} + 2\\zeta \\omega_n s + \\omega_n^{2}}\n$$\nFor the critically damped case, we set the damping ratio $\\zeta = 1$. The transfer function becomes:\n$$\nG(s) = \\frac{\\omega_n^{2}}{s^{2} + 2\\omega_n s + \\omega_n^{2}} = \\frac{\\omega_n^{2}}{(s + \\omega_n)^{2}}\n$$\nNow, we find the output in the Laplace domain, $Y(s)$:\n$$\nY(s) = G(s) U(s) = \\left( \\frac{\\omega_n^{2}}{(s + \\omega_n)^{2}} \\right) \\left( \\frac{1}{s} \\right) = \\frac{\\omega_n^{2}}{s(s + \\omega_n)^{2}}\n$$\nTo find the time-domain response $y(t)$, we must compute the inverse Laplace transform of $Y(s)$. This requires a partial fraction expansion. The expression for $Y(s)$ has a simple pole at $s = 0$ and a repeated pole of order $2$ at $s = -\\omega_n$. The expansion has the form:\n$$\nY(s) = \\frac{A}{s} + \\frac{B}{s + \\omega_n} + \\frac{C}{(s + \\omega_n)^{2}}\n$$\nThe coefficients $A$, $B$, and $C$ are determined as follows.\n\nThe coefficient $A$ is found using the residue method for the simple pole at $s=0$:\n$$\nA = \\lim_{s \\to 0} s Y(s) = \\lim_{s \\to 0} \\frac{\\omega_n^{2}}{(s + \\omega_n)^{2}} = \\frac{\\omega_n^{2}}{(0 + \\omega_n)^{2}} = \\frac{\\omega_n^{2}}{\\omega_n^{2}} = 1\n$$\nThe coefficient $C$ is found for the highest-order term of the repeated pole at $s=-\\omega_n$:\n$$\nC = \\lim_{s \\to -\\omega_n} (s + \\omega_n)^{2} Y(s) = \\lim_{s \\to -\\omega_n} \\frac{\\omega_n^{2}}{s} = \\frac{\\omega_n^{2}}{-\\omega_n} = -\\omega_n\n$$\nThe coefficient $B$ is found for the lower-order term of the repeated pole:\n$$\nB = \\lim_{s \\to -\\omega_n} \\frac{1}{(2-1)!} \\frac{d}{ds} \\left[ (s + \\omega_n)^{2} Y(s) \\right] = \\lim_{s \\to -\\omega_n} \\frac{d}{ds} \\left( \\frac{\\omega_n^{2}}{s} \\right)\n$$\n$$\nB = \\lim_{s \\to -\\omega_n} \\left( -\\frac{\\omega_n^{2}}{s^{2}} \\right) = -\\frac{\\omega_n^{2}}{(-\\omega_n)^{2}} = -\\frac{\\omega_n^{2}}{\\omega_n^{2}} = -1\n$$\nSubstituting the coefficients $A=1$, $B=-1$, and $C=-\\omega_n$ back into the expansion gives:\n$$\nY(s) = \\frac{1}{s} - \\frac{1}{s + \\omega_n} - \\frac{\\omega_n}{(s + \\omega_n)^{2}}\n$$\nThe time-domain response $y(t)$ is the inverse Laplace transform of $Y(s)$.

The input is a unit step, and the DC gain of the system is $G(0) = \\frac{\\omega_n^2}{\\omega_n^2} = 1$. Therefore, the final value of the output is $\\lim_{t \\to \\infty} y(t) = 1$. Overshoot would imply that $y(t) > 1$ for some time $t > 0$.\n\nWe can analyze this from first principles by examining the derivative of $y(t)$. An overshoot would require the function $y(t)$ to increase past $y=1$ and then decrease, which necessitates that its derivative, $\\dot{y}(t)$, must be zero at some peak time $t_p > 0$ where $y(t_p) > 1$.\n\nLet's compute the derivative of $y(t)$:\n$$\n\\dot{y}(t) = \\frac{d}{dt} \\left[ 1 - (1 + \\omega_n t)e^{-\\omega_n t} \\right]\n$$\nUsing the product rule for the second term:\n$$\n\\dot{y}(t) = 0 - \\left[ (\\omega_n)e^{-\\omega_n t} + (1 + \\omega_n t)(-\\omega_n e^{-\\omega_n t}) \\right]\n$$\n$$\n\\dot{y}(t) = - \\left[ \\omega_n e^{-\\omega_n t} - \\omega_n e^{-\\omega_n t} - \\omega_n^2 t e^{-\\omega_n t} \\right]\n$$\n$$\n\\dot{y}(t) = \\omega_n^2 t e^{-\\omega_n t}\n$$\nWe analyze the sign of $\\dot{y}(t)$ for $t \\ge 0$. The parameter $\\omega_n$ is given as $\\omega_n > 0$, so $\\omega_n^2 > 0$. The exponential term $e^{-\\omega_n t}$ is strictly positive for all finite $t$. The time variable $t$ is non-negative, $t \\ge 0$.\nTherefore, for all $t > 0$, every factor in the expression for $\\dot{y}(t)$ is strictly positive. This means $\\dot{y}(t) > 0$ for all $t > 0$. At $t=0$, $\\dot{y}(0) = 0$.\n\nSince the derivative $\\dot{y}(t)$ is non-negative for all $t \\ge 0$, the function $y(t)$ is monotonically non-decreasing. The system starts at rest, which we can verify: $y(0) = 1 - (1 + 0)e^0 = 1 - 1 = 0$. The function $y(t)$ starts at $0$ and increases monotonically towards its final value of $1$. A monotonically increasing function can never exceed its limiting value.\n\nThus, $y(t) \\le 1$ for all $t \\ge 0$. No overshoot is possible for a critically damped second-order system.

The steady-state value for a unit step input is $y_{\\infty} = K \\cdot 1 = 1$, which is also consistent.\nThe superposition principle is fundamental to LTI systems. The decomposition into zero-state and zero-input responses is standard procedure.\nThe question concerns the possibility of overshoot in a critically damped system when non-zero initial conditions are present. This is a valid, non-trivial problem in control theory that correctly probes the limits of the common assertion that systems with $\\zeta \\ge 1$ do not overshoot (which is only strictly true for the zero-state response to a step input).\nThe problem is scientifically grounded, self-contained, well-posed, and objective.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem statement is valid. I will proceed to derive the solution.\n\n**Derivation of System Responses**\n\nFirst, we derive the zero-state response $y_{\\mathrm{zs}}(t)$. The governing equation is $\\ddot{y}_{\\mathrm{zs}}(t)+6\\dot{y}_{\\mathrm{zs}}(t)+9y_{\\mathrm{zs}}(t)=9$ for $t \\ge 0$, with initial conditions $y_{\\mathrm{zs}}(0^{-})=0$ and $\\dot{y}_{\\mathrm{zs}}(0^{-})=0$. The characteristic equation is $s^2+6s+9=0$, or $(s+3)^2=0$, with repeated roots $s_{1,2}=-3$.\nThe homogeneous solution is $y_h(t) = (C_1+C_2 t)e^{-3t}$. The particular solution for a constant input is a constant, $y_p$. Substituting into the ODE gives $9y_p = 9$, so $y_p=1$.\nThe complete solution is $y_{\\mathrm{zs}}(t) = 1 + (C_1+C_2 t)e^{-3t}$.\nThe transfer function is $G(s) = \\frac{9}{s^2+6s+9}$, which is strictly proper. Thus, the states do not jump at $t=0$, and $y_{\\mathrm{zs}}(0^{+})=y_{\\mathrm{zs}}(0^{-})=0$, $\\dot{y}_{\\mathrm{zs}}(0^{+})=\\dot{y}_{\\mathrm{zs}}(0^{-})=0$.\nApplying initial conditions:\n$y_{\\mathrm{zs}}(0) = 1 + C_1 = 0 \\implies C_1 = -1$.\n$\\dot{y}_{\\mathrm{zs}}(t) = C_2 e^{-3t} - 3(C_1+C_2 t)e^{-3t}$.\n$\\dot{y}_{\\mathrm{zs}}(0) = C_2 - 3C_1 = 0 \\implies C_2 = 3C_1 = -3$.\nThe zero-state response is $y_{\\mathrm{zs}}(t) = 1 + (-1-3t)e^{-3t} = 1 - (1+3t)e^{-3t}$ for $t \\ge 0$.\n\nSecond, we derive the zero-input response $y_{\\mathrm{zi}}(t)$. The equation is $\\ddot{y}_{\\mathrm{zi}}(t)+6\\dot{y}_{\\mathrm{zi}}(t)+9y_{\\mathrm{zi}}(t)=0$ with initial conditions $y_{\\mathrm{zi}}(0^{-})=y_0$ and $\\dot{y}_{\\mathrm{zi}}(0^{-})=v_0$. Since the input is zero, $y_{\\mathrm{zi}}(0^{+})=y_0$ and $\\dot{y}_{\\mathrm{zi}}(0^{+})=v_0$.\nThe solution is of the form $y_{\\mathrm{zi}}(t) = (D_1+D_2 t)e^{-3t}$.\nApplying initial conditions:\n$y_{\\mathrm{zi}}(0) = D_1 = y_0$.\n$\\dot{y}_{\\mathrm{zi}}(t) = D_2 e^{-3t} - 3(D_1+D_2 t)e^{-3t}$.\n$\\dot{y}_{\\mathrm{zi}}(0) = D_2 - 3D_1 = v_0 \\implies D_2 = v_0+3D_1 = v_0+3y_0$.\nThe zero-input response is $y_{\\mathrm{zi}}(t) = (y_0 + (v_0+3y_0)t)e^{-3t}$ for $t \\ge 0$.\n\nThird, the total response is $y(t) = y_{\\mathrm{zs}}(t) + y_{\\mathrm{zi}}(t)$:\n$y(t) = \\left( 1 - (1+3t)e^{-3t} \\right) + \\left( y_0 + (v_0+3y_0)t \\right)e^{-3t}$\n$y(t) = 1 + (y_0 - 1)e^{-3t} + (v_0+3y_0-3)te^{-3t}$.\n\n**Derivation of Overshoot Condition**\nOvershoot is defined as $y(t) > y_{\\infty}$ for some $t \\ge 0$. With $y_{\\infty}=1$, the condition is $y(t)>1$.\n$1 + (y_0 - 1)e^{-3t} + (v_0+3y_0-3)te^{-3t} > 1$\n$(y_0 - 1)e^{-3t} + (v_0+3y_0-3)te^{-3t} > 0$\nSince $e^{-3t}>0$ for all finite $t$, we can divide by it:\n$(y_0 - 1) + (v_0+3y_0-3)t > 0$.\nLet us analyze this inequality for $t \\ge 0$.\n- If $y_0 > 1$: At $t=0$, the inequality becomes $y_0 - 1 > 0$, which is true. Thus, if the initial position is already above the steady-state value, the condition for overshoot is immediately satisfied at $t=0$.\n- If $y_0 \\le 1$: The term $y_0-1$ is non-positive. For the inequality to hold for some $t>0$, the linear function of $t$, let's call it $f(t) = (y_0-1) + (v_0+3y_0-3)t$, must be able to become positive. Since $f(0) \\le 0$, this requires the slope of the function to be a positive value.\nThe slope is $(v_0+3y_0-3)$. Thus, we require $v_0+3y_0-3 > 0$, which is $v_0 > 3-3y_0$, or $v_0 > 3(1-y_0)$. If this condition on the slope holds, $f(t)$ will eventually become positive for $t > -(y_0-1)/(v_0+3y_0-3)$.\n\nCombining these cases, the necessary and sufficient condition for the total response to exhibit an overshoot is:\n$y_0 > 1$ or $v_0 > 3(1-y_0)$.\n\n**Evaluation of Options**\n\n**A. For $y(0^{-})=0$ and $\\dot{y}(0^{-})=4$, the total response overshoots the steady-state value. The peak occurs at $t_{p}=\\tfrac{4}{3}$ with peak value $y(t_{p})=1+\\tfrac{1}{3}\\mathrm{e}^{-4}$.**\nGiven $y_0=0$ and $v_0=4$. We check the overshoot condition: $y_0=0 \\ngtr 1$. We check the second part: $v_0 > 3(1-y_0) \\implies 4 > 3(1-0) \\implies 4 > 3$. This is true, so an overshoot must occur.\nTo find the peak time $t_p$, we set $\\dot{y}(t)=0$. The total response is $y(t) = 1+(0-1)e^{-3t}+(4+0-3)te^{-3t} = 1 - e^{-3t} + te^{-3t}$.\nThe derivative is $\\dot{y}(t) = -(-3)e^{-3t} + e^{-3t} + t(-3)e^{-3t} = (3+1-3t)e^{-3t} = (4-3t)e^{-3t}$.\nSetting $\\dot{y}(t)=0$ for $t>0$ implies $4-3t=0$, so $t_p = 4/3$.\nThe peak value is $y(t_p) = y(4/3) = 1 - e^{-3(4/3)} + \\frac{4}{3}e^{-3(4/3)} = 1 - e^{-4} + \\frac{4}{3}e^{-4} = 1 + \\frac{1}{3}e^{-4}$.\nAll claims in this option are correct.\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\n**B. If $\\zeta\\ge 1$, overshoot above the steady-state value cannot occur for any initial conditions when the input is a unit step.**\nThis statement is a common fallacy which confuses the total response with the zero-state response. The zero-state step response for $\\zeta \\ge 1$ does not overshoot. However, as demonstrated in the analysis of option A, with non-zero initial conditions $(y_0=0, v_0=4)$, an overshoot does occur. Therefore, the statement is false.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**C. For this critically damped system, the total response overshoots the steady-state value if and only if $y_{0}>1$ or $v_{0}>3\\,(1-y_{0})$.**\nThis statement matches precisely the necessary and sufficient condition derived from first principles. Our analysis showed that overshoot, defined as $y(t)>1$ for some $t \\ge 0$, occurs if and only if the initial state $(y_0, v_0)$ satisfies this compound inequality.\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\n**D. For $y(0^{-})=1.2$ and $\\dot{y}(0^{-})=-10$, the total response does not overshoot the steady-state value because the initial velocity is strongly negative.**\nGiven $y_0 = 1.2$ and $v_0 = -10$. We check the overshoot condition: $y_0=1.2 > 1$. The first part of the condition \"$y_0>1$ or $v_0>3(1-y_0)$\" is satisfied. Therefore, an overshoot does occur. In fact, it occurs at $t=0$, since $y(0)=y_0=1.2 > y_\\infty=1$. The statement that the response \"does not overshoot\" is false. The provided reason is an intuitive but ultimately incorrect piece of physical reasoning that is not a substitute for rigorous mathematical analysis.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**E. The decomposition $y(t)=y_{\\mathrm{zs}}(t)+y_{\\mathrm{zi}}(t)$ is invalid when the initial conditions are nonzero because the system is not strictly proper.**\nThis statement is incorrect on two counts. First, the decomposition of the response into zero-state and zero-input components is a direct consequence of the superposition principle, which is the defining characteristic of linear systems like the one given. It is valid for any LTI system, regardless of initial conditions. Second, the system's transfer function is $G(s) = \\frac{9}{s^2+6s+9}$. The degree of the denominator polynomial ($2$) is greater than the degree of the numerator polynomial ($0$), which means the system is, by definition, strictly proper.

Ensure the bracketing search expands if an initial bracket is not found, and ensure continuity is respected in all damping regimes.\n- Return $t_r = t_{0.9} - t_{0.1}$ in seconds for each test case, rounded to six decimal places.\n\nTest suite:\n- Case $1$: $(\\zeta, \\omega_n) = (0.2, 5.0)$.\n- Case $2$: $(\\zeta, \\omega_n) = (1.0, 4.0)$.\n- Case $3$: $(\\zeta, \\omega_n) = (1.5, 3.0)$.\n- Case $4$: $(\\zeta, \\omega_n) = (0.0, 2.0)$.\n- Case $5$: $(\\zeta, \\omega_n) = (0.05, 10.0)$.\n\nFinal output format:\nYour program should produce a single line of output containing the five rise times, in seconds, as a comma-separated list enclosed in square brackets, in the same order as the test suite, each rounded to six decimal places. For example, an acceptable format is\n$[t_{r,1}, t_{r,2}, t_{r,3}, t_{r,4}, t_{r,5}]$,\nwhere each $t_{r,i}$ is a decimal numeral with exactly six digits after the decimal point.", "solution": "The problem requires the calculation of the $10-90\\%$ rise time for a standard second-order linear time-invariant (LTI) system subjected to a unit step input. The solution entails two principal steps: first, deriving the analytical expression for the system's output $y(t)$, and second, developing a robust numerical procedure to find the times at which the output crosses specific levels.\n\nThe system is described by the ordinary differential equation (ODE):\n$$\n\\frac{d^2 y}{dt^2} + 2 \\zeta \\omega_n \\frac{d y}{dt} + \\omega_n^2 y = \\omega_n^2\n$$\nwith initial conditions $y(0) = 0$ and $\\frac{dy}{dt}(0) = 0$. The parameters are the damping ratio $\\zeta \\ge 0$ and the natural frequency $\\omega_n > 0$. The final value of the response is $y(\\infty) = 1$. The rise time is defined as $t_r = t_{0.9} - t_{0.1}$, where $t_\\alpha = \\inf \\{ t > 0 \\mid y(t) = \\alpha \\}$.\n\n**Part 1: Analytical Solution for the Step Response $y(t)$**\n\nThe solution to the non-homogeneous ODE is the sum of the particular solution, $y_p(t)$, and the homogeneous solution, $y_h(t)$. For a unit step input, the forcing term is a constant $\\omega_n^2$. In the steady state ($t \\to \\infty$), the derivatives vanish, yielding $\\omega_n^2 y(\\infty) = \\omega_n^2$, so the particular solution is $y_p(t) = 1$.\n\nThe homogeneous solution $y_h(t)$ is found by solving $\\frac{d^2 y_h}{dt^2} + 2 \\zeta \\omega_n \\frac{d y_h}{dt} + \\omega_n^2 y_h = 0$. The corresponding characteristic equation is:\n$$\ns^2 + 2\\zeta\\omega_n s + \\omega_n^2 = 0\n$$\nThe roots are given by $s_{1,2} = -\\zeta\\omega_n \\pm \\omega_n \\sqrt{\\zeta^2 - 1}$. The form of the total solution $y(t) = y_p(t) + y_h(t)$ depends on the nature of these roots, which is determined by the value of $\\zeta$.\n\n**Case I: Overdamped System ($\\zeta > 1$)**\nThe roots $s_1$ and $s_2$ are real, distinct, and negative:\n$$\ns_1 = -\\zeta\\omega_n - \\omega_n \\sqrt{\\zeta^2 - 1}, \\quad s_2 = -\\zeta\\omega_n + \\omega_n \\sqrt{\\zeta^2 - 1}\n$$\nThe general solution is $y(t) = 1 + C_1 e^{s_1 t} + C_2 e^{s_2 t}$. Applying the initial conditions $y(0)=0$ and $y'(0)=0$ yields a system of equations for the constants $C_1$ and $C_2$:\n$$\n\\begin{cases}\n1 + C_1 + C_2 = 0 \\\\\nC_1 s_1 + C_2 s_2 = 0\n\\end{cases}\n$$\nSolving this system gives $C_1 = \\frac{s_2}{s_1 - s_2}$ and $C_2 = \\frac{-s_1}{s_1 - s_2}$. The complete response is:\n$$\ny(t) = 1 + \\frac{s_2}{s_1 - s_2} e^{s_1 t} + \\frac{-s_1}{s_1 - s_2} e^{s_2 t}\n$$\nThis form is numerically stable since $s_1$ and $s_2$ are negative, preventing overflow in the exponential terms.\n\n**Case II: Critically Damped System ($\\zeta = 1$)**\nThe roots are real and repeated: $s_1 = s_2 = -\\omega_n$.\nThe general solution is $y(t) = 1 + (C_1 + C_2 t) e^{-\\omega_n t}$. Applying initial conditions:\n$y(0)=0 \\implies 1+C_1 = 0 \\implies C_1 = -1$.\n$y'(0)=0 \\implies C_2 - \\omega_n C_1 = 0 \\implies C_2 = -\\omega_n$.\nThe complete response is:\n$$\ny(t) = 1 - (1 + \\omega_n t) e^{-\\omega_n t}\n$$\n\n**Case III: Underdamped System ($0 \\le \\zeta  1$)**\nThe roots are complex conjugates: $s_{1,2} = -\\zeta\\omega_n \\pm i\\omega_n \\sqrt{1 - \\zeta^2}$. Let the damped natural frequency be $\\omega_d = \\omega_n \\sqrt{1 - \\zeta^2}$.\nThe general solution is $y(t) = 1 + e^{-\\zeta\\omega_n t} (C_1 \\cos(\\omega_d t) + C_2 \\sin(\\omega_d t))$. Applying initial conditions:\n$y(0)=0 \\implies 1+C_1=0 \\implies C_1 = -1$.\n$y'(0)=0 \\implies -\\zeta\\omega_n C_1 + \\omega_d C_2 = 0 \\implies C_2 = -\\frac{\\zeta\\omega_n}{\\omega_d} = -\\frac{\\zeta}{\\sqrt{1 - \\zeta^2}}$.\nThe complete response is:\n$$\ny(t) = 1 - e^{-\\zeta\\omega_n t} \\left( \\cos(\\omega_d t) + \\frac{\\zeta}{\\sqrt{1 - \\zeta^2}} \\sin(\\omega_d t) \\right)\n$$\nThis expression is valid for the undamped case ($\\zeta=0$), where it simplifies to $y(t) = 1 - \\cos(\\omega_n t)$.\n\n**Part 2: Numerical Procedure for Rise Time Calculation**\n\nThe task is to find $t_{0.1}$ and $t_{0.9}$, which are the first positive roots of the equations $y(t) - 0.1 = 0$ and $y(t) - 0.9 = 0$, respectively.\nFor a given level $\\alpha \\in \\{0.1, 0.9\\}$, we define the function $f_\\alpha(t) = y(t) - \\alpha$ and seek its smallest positive root.\n\nThe numerical procedure follows the specified two-stage process:\n\n1.  **Root Bracketing**: We must find an interval $[a, b]$ such that $f_\\alpha(a)$ and $f_\\alpha(b)$ have opposite signs. We know $y(0)=0$, so $f_\\alpha(0) = -\\alpha  0$. Since the system is stable and reaches a final value of $1$, the response $y(t)$ will eventually exceed $\\alpha$. We can thus find a root by searching for the first time $t>0$ where $f_\\alpha(t) \\ge 0$.\n    A simple and effective bracketing algorithm starts with a small interval $[0, \\Delta t]$ and iteratively expands it. We set $t_{low} = 0$ and check the sign of $f_\\alpha(t)$ at $t_{high} = k\\Delta t$ for $k=1, 2, \\dots$. A suitable step size $\\Delta t$ should be chosen relative to the system's characteristic time, such as $\\Delta t = c/\\omega_n$ for some small constant $c$. Once we find a $t_{high}$ for which $f_\\alpha(t_{high}) \\ge 0$, the bracket is established as $[t_{low}, t_{high}]$.\n\n2.  **Root Finding**: Once a bracket $[a, b]$ is found, a reliable numerical root-finding algorithm can be employed. The Brent-Dekker method, implemented in `scipy.optimize.brentq`, is an excellent choice. It combines the speed of secant/interpolation methods with the robustness of bisection, guaranteeing convergence if a valid bracket is provided. This method will find the root $t_\\alpha$ to a high degree of precision.\n\nThe rise time is then computed as $t_r = t_{0.9} - t_{0.1}$.
