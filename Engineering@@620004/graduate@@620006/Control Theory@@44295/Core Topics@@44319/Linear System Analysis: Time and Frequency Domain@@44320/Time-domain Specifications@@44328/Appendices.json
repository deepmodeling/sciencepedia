We hypothesize the general solution is:\n$$\ny[k] = (1-r^k)\\,y_{\\infty}\n$$\nWe must verify this solution.\nCheck initial condition: For $k=0$, $y[0] = (1-r^0)\\,y_{\\infty} = (1-1)\\,y_{\\infty} = 0$, which is correct.\nCheck difference equation: Substitute the hypothesized solution into the right-hand side of the original equation:\n$$\nr\\,y[k] + (1-r)\\,y_{\\infty} = r\\bigl((1-r^k)\\,y_{\\infty}\\bigr) + (1-r)\\,y_{\\infty} = (r - r^{k+1} + 1-r)\\,y_{\\infty} = (1-r^{k+1})\\,y_{\\infty}\n$$\nThis result is equal to $y[k+1]$ according to our hypothesized solution.
