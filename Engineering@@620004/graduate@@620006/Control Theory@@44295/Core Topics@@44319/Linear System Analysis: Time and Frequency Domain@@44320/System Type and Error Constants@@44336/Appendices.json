A complete solution will now be derived.\n\nThe problem requires a derivation from first principles. We begin with the open-loop transfer function, $L(s)$, which is the product of the controller transfer function, $C(s)$, and the plant transfer function, $P(s)$.\n$$L(s) = C(s)P(s)$$\nThe controller is a Proportional-Integral (PI) type:\n$$C(s) = k_p + \\frac{k_i}{s} = \\frac{k_p s + k_i}{s}$$\nThe plant is given as:\n$$P(s) = \\frac{10}{(s+1)(s+2)}$$\nCombining these, the open-loop transfer function is:\n$$L(s) = \\left(\\frac{k_p s + k_i}{s}\\right) \\left(\\frac{10}{(s+1)(s+2)}\\right) = \\frac{10(k_p s + k_i)}{s(s+1)(s+2)}$$\nThe system type, denoted by $T$, is defined as the number of pure integrators in the open-loop transfer function $L(s)$. A pure integrator corresponds to a pole at $s=0$. By inspection of the expression for $L(s)$, there is a single pole at the origin, contributed by the term $s$ in the denominator. Therefore, the system type is $T=1$.\n\nNext, we derive the error constants. For a unity negative-feedback system, the error signal in the Laplace domain, $E(s)$, is related to the reference input, $R(s)$, by:\n$$E(s) = \\frac{1}{1+L(s)} R(s)$$\nThe steady-state error, $e_{ss}$, is determined using the Final Value Theorem, which is applicable as the problem states the closed-loop system is stable.\n$$e_{ss} = \\lim_{t \\to \\infty} e(t) = \\lim_{s \\to 0} s E(s)$$\nSubstituting the expression for $E(s)$:\n$$e_{ss} = \\lim_{s \\to 0} s \\left(\\frac{1}{1+L(s)}\\right) R(s)$$\nThe position error constant, $K_p$, is defined in relation to the steady-state error for a unit step input, where $R(s) = \\frac{1}{s}$. The steady-state error is given by $e_{ss, \\text{step}} = \\frac{1}{1+K_p}$.\nUsing the Final Value Theorem for a step input:\n$$e_{ss, \\text{step}} = \\lim_{s \\to 0} s \\left(\\frac{1}{1+L(s)}\\right) \\frac{1}{s} = \\lim_{s \\to 0} \\frac{1}{1+L(s)} = \\frac{1}{1 + \\lim_{s \\to 0} L(s)}$$\nBy comparing the two expressions for $e_{ss, \\text{step}}$, we identify the position error constant as:\n$$K_p = \\lim_{s \\to 0} L(s)$$\nWe compute this limit for our system:\n$$K_p = \\lim_{s \\to 0} \\frac{10(k_p s + k_i)}{s(s+1)(s+2)}$$\nAs $s \\to 0$, the numerator approaches $10 k_i$. Since the problem specifies $k_i > 0$, the numerator is a non-zero positive constant. The denominator approaches $0$. Therefore, the limit is infinite.\n$$K_p = \\infty$$\nThis is consistent with a Type $1$ system, for which the steady-state error to a step input is zero: $e_{ss, \\text{step}} = \\frac{1}{1+\\infty} = 0$.\n\nThe velocity error constant, $K_v$, is defined in relation to the steady-state error for a unit ramp input, where $R(s) = \\frac{1}{s^2}$. The steady-state error is given by $e_{ss, \\text{ramp}} = \\frac{1}{K_v}$.\nUsing the Final Value Theorem for a ramp input:\n$$e_{ss, \\text{ramp}} = \\lim_{s \\to 0} s \\left(\\frac{1}{1+L(s)}\\right) \\frac{1}{s^2} = \\lim_{s \\to 0} \\frac{1}{s(1+L(s))} = \\lim_{s \\to 0} \\frac{1}{s + sL(s)}$$\nSince $L(s)$ has a pole at $s=0$, the term $s$ in the denominator of the limit evaluates to $0$. The limit is thus determined by the term $sL(s)$.\n$$e_{ss, \\text{ramp}} = \\frac{1}{\\lim_{s \\to 0} sL(s)}$$\nBy comparing the two expressions for $e_{ss, \\text{ramp}}$, we identify the velocity error constant as:\n$$K_v = \\lim_{s \\to 0} sL(s)$$\nWe compute this limit for our system:\n$$K_v = \\lim_{s \\to 0} s \\left(\\frac{10(k_p s + k_i)}{s(s+1)(s+2)}\\right) = \\lim_{s \\to 0} \\frac{10(k_p s + k_i)}{(s+1)(s+2)}$$\nSubstituting $s=0$ into the continuous expression yields:\n$$K_v = \\frac{10(k_p \\cdot 0 + k_i)}{(0+1)(0+2)} = \\frac{10 k_i}{2} = 5k_i$$\nThis is a finite, non-zero value, which is characteristic of a Type $1$ system responding to a ramp input.\n\nThe final requested quantities are the system type $T$, the position error constant $K_p$, and the velocity error constant $K_v$.\n$T = 1$\n$K_p = \\infty$\n$K_v = 5k_i$\n\nThe result is to be reported as the row matrix $(T, K_p, K_v)$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n1 & \\infty & 5k_i\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "2752299"}, {"introduction": "Building upon the ideal case, we now explore a crucial practical consideration: what happens when our integrator is not perfect?

It requires a derivation from first principles within the established framework of linear time-invariant control theory. We shall proceed with the solution.\n\nThe tracking error in a unity-feedback system is defined by $e(t) = r(t) - y(t)$, where $r(t)$ is the reference input and $y(t)$ is the system output. Its Laplace transform is $E(s) = R(s) - Y(s)$. The output $Y(s)$ is related to the error signal $E(s)$ through the open-loop transfer function $L(s) = C_{\\ell}(s)G(s)$, such that $Y(s) = L(s)E(s)$. Note that for a unity-feedback configuration, the error signal is the input to the controller.\n\nSubstituting the expression for $Y(s)$ into the equation for $E(s)$ yields:\n$$E(s) = R(s) - L(s)E(s)$$\nSolving for $E(s)$, we find:\n$$E(s)(1 + L(s)) = R(s)$$\n$$E(s) = \\frac{1}{1+L(s)} R(s)$$\nThe function $S(s) = \\frac{1}{1+L(s)}$ is, by definition, the sensitivity function of the closed-loop system.

We apply the Final Value Theorem, which is valid because the closed-loop system is assumed to be internally stable.\n$$e_{\\mathrm{ss}} = \\lim_{s \\to 0} s E(s)$$\nThe reference input is a step function $r(t) = A u(t)$, whose Laplace transform is $R(s) = \\frac{A}{s}$.

We must evaluate its limit as $s \\to 0$. We are given that $\\lim_{s \\to 0} G(s) = G_{0}$, a finite, nonzero constant.\n$$\\lim_{s \\to 0} L(s) = \\lim_{s \\to 0} \\left( \\frac{k}{s+\\epsilon} G(s) \\right) = \\left( \\lim_{s \\to 0} \\frac{k}{s+\\epsilon} \\right) \\left( \\lim_{s \\to 0} G(s) \\right)$$\nThe evaluation of this limit must consider the two possibilities for $\\epsilon \\ge 0$.\n\nFirst, consider the case of a perfect integrator, where $\\epsilon = 0$. The controller is $C_{\\ell}(s) = \\frac{k}{s}$, and the open-loop transfer function is $L(s) = \\frac{k G(s)}{s}$. Its limit as $s \\to 0$ is:\n$$\\lim_{s \\to 0} L(s) = \\lim_{s \\to 0} \\frac{k G(s)}{s} = \\frac{k G_{0}}{0}$$\nSince $k > 0$ and $G_{0} \\neq 0$, this limit diverges to infinity. The steady-state error is then:\n$$e_{\\mathrm{ss}} = \\frac{A}{1 + \\infty} = 0$$\n\nNext, consider the case of the leaky integrator, where $\\epsilon > 0$. The limit of the open-loop transfer function is:\n$$\\lim_{s \\to 0} L(s) = \\frac{k}{0+\\epsilon} \\cdot G_{0} = \\frac{k G_{0}}{\\epsilon}$$\nThis is a finite value. The steady-state error is:\n$$e_{\\mathrm{ss}} = \\frac{A}{1 + \\frac{k G_{0}}{\\epsilon}} = \\frac{A}{\\frac{\\epsilon + k G_{0}}{\\epsilon}} = \\frac{A \\epsilon}{\\epsilon + k G_{0}}$$\nThis expression represents the general solution for the steady-state error. It correctly simplifies to $e_{\\mathrm{ss}} = 0$ when $\\epsilon = 0$ is substituted (given $k G_{0} \\neq 0$), thereby encompassing both cases. This is the required closed-form expression.\n\nThe influence of the parameter $\\epsilon$ on the steady-state error is fundamentally linked to its effect on the system type. The system type is defined by the number of pure integrators (poles at $s=0$) in the open-loop transfer function $L(s)$. The plant $G(s)$ is asymptotically stable and thus contains no poles at the origin. The system type is therefore determined solely by the controller $C_{\\ell}(s)$.\n- When $\\epsilon=0$, the controller $C_{\\ell}(s) = \\frac{k}{s}$ has a pole precisely at the origin. This makes the system a **Type 1** system. A Type 1 system possesses infinite DC gain ($\\lim_{s \\to 0} L(s) \\to \\infty$) and is thus able to track a constant (step) reference input with zero steady-state error, which aligns perfectly with our result $e_{\\mathrm{ss}} = 0$.\n- When $\\epsilon > 0$, the controller $C_{\\ell}(s) = \\frac{k}{s+\\epsilon}$ possesses a pole at $s=-\\epsilon$, which is not at the origin. Therefore, the open-loop transfer function $L(s)$ has no poles at the origin, and the system is classified as a **Type 0** system. A Type 0 system has a finite DC gain, which we calculated as $\\lim_{s \\to 0} L(s) = \\frac{k G_{0}}{\\epsilon}$. This finite gain means the control loop cannot fully eliminate the error for a constant input, resulting in a persistent, non-zero steady-state error. The magnitude of this error, $e_{\\mathrm{ss}} = \\frac{A \\epsilon}{\\epsilon + k G_{0}}$, is directly proportional to $\\epsilon$, the \"leakiness\" of the integrator, and inversely related to the low-frequency gain parameters $k$ and $G_{0}$.\n\nIn conclusion, moving the controller pole from $s=0$ to $s=-\\epsilon$ (for any $\\epsilon>0$) fundamentally degrades the system's tracking capability for a step input by changing its type from 1 to 0.

By definition, the system type is the degree of the highest-degree polynomial for which this occurs. Therefore, the effective system type is $N = k = n-1$.\n\nThe differentiating sensor $H(s)$ introduces a zero at the origin, which cancels one of the $n$ integrators from the plant-controller cascade $G(s)C(s)$ within the loop gain $L(s)$, reducing the effective number of integrators in the loop to $n-1$.
