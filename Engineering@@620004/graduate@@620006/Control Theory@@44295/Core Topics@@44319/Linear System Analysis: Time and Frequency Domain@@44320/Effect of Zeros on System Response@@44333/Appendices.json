It presents a standard exercise in linear control theory involving the analysis of a second-order system with an additional zero. All necessary parameters and conditions are provided, and there are no internal contradictions or violations of physical or mathematical principles. The assumption of a dominant second-order behavior is explicitly stated, which is a common and valid simplification in system analysis. The problem is therefore deemed **valid**.\n\nProceeding to the solution.\n\nThe tasks are addressed in sequence as requested.\n\n1. Derivation of the Characteristic Polynomial and Coefficient Identification\nThe characteristic equation for a unity-feedback system is given by $1 + G(s) = 0$. Substituting the given forward-path transfer function $G(s)$:\n$$\n1 + \\frac{K(s+z)}{(s+p)(s+q)} = 0\n$$\nTo eliminate the fraction, we multiply by the denominator $(s+p)(s+q)$, which is the characteristic polynomial of the open-loop plant, to obtain the closed-loop characteristic polynomial:\n$$\n(s+p)(s+q) + K(s+z) = 0\n$$\nExpanding the polynomial terms:\n$$\ns^2 + ps + qs + pq + Ks + Kz = 0\n$$\nGrouping the terms by powers of $s$:\n$$\ns^2 + (p+q+K)s + (pq + Kz) = 0\n$$\nThis is the closed-loop characteristic polynomial. We now compare this to the canonical second-order polynomial, $s^2 + 2\\zeta\\omega_n s + \\omega_n^2 = 0$. By equating the coefficients of like powers of $s$, we identify the relationships for the natural frequency $\\omega_n$ and the damping ratio $\\zeta$:\n$$\n\\omega_n^2 = pq + Kz\n$$\n$$\n2\\zeta\\omega_n = p+q+K\n$$\n\n2. Derivation of Damping Ratio $\\zeta$\nUsing the two equations derived above, we can now find an explicit expression for $\\zeta$. From the first equation, and knowing that the natural frequency $\\omega_n$ is a positive quantity, we have:\n$$\n\\omega_n = \\sqrt{pq + Kz}\n$$\nWe substitute this expression for $\\omega_n$ into the second equation:\n$$\n2\\zeta\\sqrt{pq+Kz} = p+q+K\n$$\nSolving for $\\zeta$ yields the desired expression as a function of the system parameters:\n$$\n\\zeta = \\frac{p+q+K}{2\\sqrt{pq+Kz}}\n$$\nThis is the final analytical expression required.\n\n3. Arguments on the Effect of the LHP Zero\nWe now provide the required arguments based on the derived relationships and standard second-order system facts.\n\n- **Effect of increasing $z$ on $\\zeta$ for a fixed gain $K$**:\nWe analyze the derived expression for $\\zeta$ by treating $K$, $p$, and $q$ as fixed positive constants. The numerator, $p+q+K$, is a positive constant. The denominator is $2\\sqrt{pq+Kz}$. As the zero location $z>0$ is increased, the term $Kz$ increases since $K>0$. This causes the argument of the square root, $pq+Kz$, to increase. Since the square root function is monotonically increasing for positive arguments, the denominator $2\\sqrt{pq+Kz}$ increases as $z$ increases. With a constant numerator and an increasing denominator, the fraction as a whole must decrease. Therefore, an increase in $z$ causes a decrease in $\\zeta$.\nIn standard second-order system response, the percentage overshoot is a function of $\\zeta$ alone for $0 < \\zeta < 1$, given by $\\%OS = 100 \\exp(-\\pi\\zeta/\\sqrt{1-\\zeta^2})$. This function decreases monotonically as $\\zeta$ increases. Consequently, the decrease in $\\zeta$ resulting from an increase in $z$ will lead to an increase in the system's transient overshoot.\n\n- **Effect on settling time for a fixed target damping ratio $\\zeta^\\star$**:\nHere we must show that for a fixed damping ratio $\\zeta = \\zeta^\\star \\in (0,1)$, the settling time can be reduced by increasing $z$. The gain $K$ must now be considered a function of $z$, i.e., $K(z)$, to maintain $\\zeta^\\star$. The settling time (for example, using the $2\\%$ criterion) is approximated by $T_s \\approx \\frac{4}{\\zeta\\omega_n}$. For a constant $\\zeta^\\star$, this becomes $T_s \\approx \\frac{4}{\\zeta^\\star\\omega_n}$. To decrease $T_s$, the term $\\sigma = \\zeta^\\star\\omega_n$, which is the magnitude of the real part of the closed-loop poles, must increase. This is equivalent to showing that $\\omega_n$ must increase with $z$.\nWe return to our two fundamental relations, now with $\\zeta=\\zeta^\\star$:\n1) $\\omega_n^2 = pq + Kz$\n2) $2\\zeta^\\star\\omega_n = p+q+K$\nFrom equation (2), we find the required gain $K$ as a function of $\\omega_n$: $K = 2\\zeta^\\star\\omega_n - (p+q)$. The requirement $K>0$ implies we must have $\\omega_n > \\frac{p+q}{2\\zeta^\\star}$.\nSubstituting this expression for $K$ into equation (1) gives a relationship between $\\omega_n$ and $z$:\n$$\n\\omega_n^2 = pq + z(2\\zeta^\\star\\omega_n - (p+q))\n$$\nRearranging gives a quadratic equation for $\\omega_n$:\n$$\n\\omega_n^2 - (2\\zeta^\\star z)\\omega_n + ((p+q)z - pq) = 0\n$$\nTo determine how $\\omega_n$ changes with $z$, we can use implicit differentiation with respect to $z$:\n$$\n2\\omega_n \\frac{d\\omega_n}{dz} - \\left( 2\\zeta^\\star\\omega_n + 2\\zeta^\\star z \\frac{d\\omega_n}{dz} \\right) + (p+q) = 0\n$$\nSolving for $\\frac{d\\omega_n}{dz}$:\n$$\n\\frac{d\\omega_n}{dz} (2\\omega_n - 2\\zeta^\\star z) = 2\\zeta^\\star\\omega_n - (p+q)\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{d\\omega_n}{dz} = \\frac{2\\zeta^\\star\\omega_n - (p+q)}{2(\\omega_n - \\zeta^\\star z)}\n$$\nThe numerator is precisely the gain $K$. So, $\\frac{d\\omega_n}{dz} = \\frac{K}{2(\\omega_n - \\zeta^\\star z)}$. We require $K>0$. The solution to the quadratic equation for $\\omega_n$ is $\\omega_n = \\zeta^\\star z \\pm \\sqrt{(\\zeta^\\star z)^2 - (p+q)z + pq}$. To ensure a positive gain $K=2\\zeta^\\star\\omega_n-(p+q)$ is possible for large $z$, we must choose the positive root, $\\omega_n = \\zeta^\\star z + \\sqrt{...}$. With this choice, the term $\\omega_n - \\zeta^\\star z$ is positive wherever a real solution for $\\omega_n$ exists.\nThus, in the interval of $z$ for which a positive gain $K$ can be found to maintain $\\zeta^\\star$, the derivative $\\frac{d\\omega_n}{dz}$ is positive. This proves that $\\omega_n$ increases with $z$. A larger $\\omega_n$ at fixed $\\zeta^\\star$ implies a larger pole magnitude and a faster settling time $T_s$. This demonstrates that the LHP zero can be used to improve response speed by attracting the root locus into the LHP, at the cost of requiring higher gain.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\frac{p+q+K}{2\\sqrt{pq+Kz}}}\n$$", "id": "2703766"}, {"introduction": "Moving beyond feedback, we now examine how zeros impact feedforward control, specifically through model inversion for perfect tracking.

The system will always exhibit an initial response in the opposite direction of its final value.\n\nFinally, we must optimize the placement of the compensator zero $\\alpha$ to minimize the initial inverse-response magnitude $|y(0^{+})|$. The objective function to minimize is:\n$$\nf(\\alpha) = |y(0^{+})| = \\frac{a\\beta}{z\\alpha}\n$$\nThe optimization is performed with respect to $\\alpha$. The parameters $a$, $\\beta$, and $z$ are fixed constants. Since these constants are all positive, minimizing the function $f(\\alpha)$ is equivalent to maximizing the denominator $\\alpha$.\nThe search for the optimal $\\alpha$ is constrained by the given conditions:\n1. $\\alpha > 0$\n2. $|\\alpha - \\beta| \\le \\Delta$\n\nThe second constraint can be expanded as:\n$$\n-\\Delta \\le \\alpha - \\beta \\le \\Delta\n$$\nAdding $\\beta$ to all parts of the inequality gives the feasible range for $\\alpha$:\n$$\n\\beta - \\Delta \\le \\alpha \\le \\beta + \\Delta\n$$\nWe substitute the given numerical values: $\\beta = 3$ and $\\Delta = 0.6$.\n$$\n3 - 0.6 \\le \\alpha \\le 3 + 0.6\n$$\n$$\n2.4 \\le \\alpha \\le 3.6\n$$\nThis interval satisfies the condition $\\alpha>0$. To minimize $|y(0^{+})|$, we must choose the largest possible value for $\\alpha$ within this feasible interval. The maximum value is at the upper bound.\n$$\n\\alpha^{\\star} = \\beta + \\Delta = 3 + 0.6 = 3.6\n$$\nThis is the optimal value of the compensator zero location that minimizes the initial inverse-response magnitude. The problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures. Thus, $\\alpha^{\\star} = 3.600$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{3.600}\n$$", "id": "2703747"}]}
