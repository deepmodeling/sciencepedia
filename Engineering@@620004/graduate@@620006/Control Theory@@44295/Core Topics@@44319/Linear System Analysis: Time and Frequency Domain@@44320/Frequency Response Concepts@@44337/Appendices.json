We may therefore proceed with a rigorous analysis.\n\nThe given plant transfer function is a linear time-invariant (LTI) system described by:\n$$G(s)=\\frac{K}{s\\left(\\frac{s}{\\omega_{z}}+1\\right)\\left(\\frac{s}{\\omega_{p}}+1\\right)}$$\nwhere $K > 0$, $\\omega_{z} > 0$, and $\\omega_{p} > 0$ are real, positive constants, and $\\omega_{z} \\neq \\omega_{p}$.\n\nTo determine the asymptotic slopes of the Bode magnitude plot, we must first find the frequency response function, $G(j\\omega)$, by substituting $s = j\\omega$ into $G(s)$, where $j = \\sqrt{-1}$ and $\\omega$ is the angular frequency in radians per unit time.\n$$G(j\\omega)=\\frac{K}{j\\omega\\left(\\frac{j\\omega}{\\omega_{z}}+1\\right)\\left(\\frac{j\\omega}{\\omega_{p}}+1\\right)}$$\nNext, we calculate the magnitude of the frequency response, $|G(j\\omega)|$. Using the property that the magnitude of a product (or quotient) of complex numbers is the product (or quotient) of their magnitudes:\n$$|G(j\\omega)| = \\frac{|K|}{|j\\omega| \\left|1 + \\frac{j\\omega}{\\omega_{z}}\\right| \\left|1 + \\frac{j\\omega}{\\omega_{p}}\\right|}$$\nGiven $K>0$ and $\\omega \\ge 0$, we have $|K|=K$ and $|j\\omega| = \\omega$. The magnitudes of the complex terms in the denominator are:\n$$\\left|1 + \\frac{j\\omega}{\\omega_{z}}\\right| = \\sqrt{1^2 + \\left(\\frac{\\omega}{\\omega_{z}}\\right)^2} = \\sqrt{1 + \\frac{\\omega^2}{\\omega_{z}^2}}$$\n$$\\left|1 + \\frac{j\\omega}{\\omega_{p}}\\right| = \\sqrt{1^2 + \\left(\\frac{\\omega}{\\omega_{p}}\\right)^2} = \\sqrt{1 + \\frac{\\omega^2}{\\omega_{p}^2}}$$\nThus, the magnitude function is:\n$$|G(j\\omega)| = \\frac{K}{\\omega \\sqrt{1 + \\frac{\\omega^2}{\\omega_{z}^2}} \\sqrt{1 + \\frac{\\omega^2}{\\omega_{p}^2}}}$$\nThe magnitude in decibels (dB) is defined as $M_{dB}(\\omega) = 20 \\log_{10}(|G(j\\omega)|)$.\n$$M_{dB}(\\omega) = 20 \\log_{10}(K) - 20 \\log_{10}(\\omega) - 10 \\log_{10}\\left(1 + \\frac{\\omega^2}{\\omega_{z}^2}\\right) - 10 \\log_{10}\\left(1 + \\frac{\\omega^2}{\\omega_{p}^2}\\right)$$\nThe slope of the Bode plot is the derivative of $M_{dB}(\\omega)$ with respect to $\\log_{10}(\\omega)$.\n\nFirst, we analyze the low-frequency asymptote, where $\\omega \\to 0^{+}$. In this limit, the ratios $\\frac{\\omega}{\\omega_{z}}$ and $\\frac{\\omega}{\\omega_{p}}$ both approach zero. We can therefore approximate the terms in the magnitude expression:\nAs $\\omega \\to 0^{+}$:\n$$\\sqrt{1 + \\frac{\\omega^2}{\\omega_{z}^2}} \\approx \\sqrt{1} = 1$$\n$$\\sqrt{1 + \\frac{\\omega^2}{\\omega_{p}^2}} \\approx \\sqrt{1} = 1$$\nThe asymptotic magnitude at low frequencies, denoted $|G(j\\omega)|_{LF}$, is:\n$$|G(j\\omega)|_{LF} \\approx \\frac{K}{\\omega \\cdot 1 \\cdot 1} = \\frac{K}{\\omega}$$\nIn decibels, the low-frequency asymptotic magnitude is:\n$$M_{dB, LF}(\\omega) \\approx 20 \\log_{10}\\left(\\frac{K}{\\omega}\\right) = 20 \\log_{10}(K) - 20 \\log_{10}(\\omega)$$\nThe slope of this line on a log-log plot (which is what a Bode plot is) is the coefficient of the $\\log_{10}(\\omega)$ term. A change of one decade in frequency corresponds to a change of $1$ in $\\log_{10}(\\omega)$. Therefore, the low-frequency asymptotic slope is $-20$ decibels per decade.\n\nSecond, we analyze the high-frequency asymptote, where $\\omega \\to \\infty$. In this limit, the ratios $\\frac{\\omega}{\\omega_{z}}$ and $\\frac{\\omega}{\\omega_{p}}$ both approach infinity. We can thus approximate the terms:\nAs $\\omega \\to \\infty$:\n$$\\sqrt{1 + \\frac{\\omega^2}{\\omega_{z}^2}} \\approx \\sqrt{\\frac{\\omega^2}{\\omega_{z}^2}} = \\frac{\\omega}{\\omega_{z}}$$\n$$\\sqrt{1 + \\frac{\\omega^2}{\\omega_{p}^2}} \\approx \\sqrt{\\frac{\\omega^2}{\\omega_{p}^2}} = \\frac{\\omega}{\\omega_{p}}$$\nThe asymptotic magnitude at high frequencies, denoted $|G(j\\omega)|_{HF}$, is:\n$$|G(j\\omega)|_{HF} \\approx \\frac{K}{\\omega \\left(\\frac{\\omega}{\\omega_{z}}\\right) \\left(\\frac{\\omega}{\\omega_{p}}\\right)} = \\frac{K \\omega_{z} \\omega_{p}}{\\omega^3}$$\nIn decibels, the high-frequency asymptotic magnitude is:\n$$M_{dB, HF}(\\omega) \\approx 20 \\log_{10}\\left(\\frac{K \\omega_{z} \\omega_{p}}{\\omega^3}\\right) = 20 \\log_{10}(K \\omega_{z} \\omega_{p}) - 20 \\log_{10}(\\omega^3)$$\nUsing the logarithm property $\\log(a^b) = b\\log(a)$:\n$$M_{dB, HF}(\\omega) \\approx 20 \\log_{10}(K \\omega_{z} \\omega_{p}) - 60 \\log_{10}(\\omega)$$\nThe slope of this line with respect to $\\log_{10}(\\omega)$ is the coefficient of the $\\log_{10}(\\omega)$ term. Therefore, the high-frequency asymptotic slope is $-60$ decibels per decade.\n\nThe slopes are therefore $-20$ dB/decade at low frequencies and $-60$ dB/decade at high frequencies.\n\nNow, for the interpretation in a feedback context. We consider the plant $G(s)$ in a standard unity feedback loop with a controller $C(s)$, so the open-loop transfer function is $L(s) = C(s)G(s)$.\n\nThe low-frequency slope of $-20$ dB/decade is a direct consequence of the single pole at the origin ($1/s$ term) in $G(s)$. This term represents an integrator. In a feedback loop, the presence of an integrator in the open-loop path results in an infinite DC gain, i.e., $|L(j\\omega)| \\to \\infty$ as $\\omega \\to 0$ (assuming the controller $C(s)$ has a non-zero DC gain $C(0)$). According to the Final Value Theorem, this infinite DC gain ensures that the steady-state error for a constant (step) reference input is zero. Thus, the $-20$ dB/decade low-frequency slope signifies high loop gain at low frequencies, which is fundamental for achieving good low-frequency reference tracking.\n\nThe high-frequency slope of $-60$ dB/decade indicates a very rapid decrease in the plant's gain as frequency increases. In a feedback system, high-frequency measurement noise is a significant concern. The transfer function from the measurement noise to the system output is the complementary sensitivity function, $T(s) = \\frac{L(s)}{1+L(s)}$. At high frequencies, the loop gain $|L(j\\omega)|$ is typically designed to be much less than $1$. In this regime, $T(j\\omega) \\approx L(j\\omega) = C(j\\omega)G(j\\omega)$. Assuming a standard controller $C(s)$ that does not add gain at high frequencies (i.e., is proper or strictly proper), the high-frequency roll-off of the loop is dominated by the plant's roll-off. A steep slope of $-60$ dB/decade ($1000$-fold attenuation for every $10$-fold increase in frequency) implies that the system provides excellent attenuation of high-frequency measurement noise, preventing it from corrupting the output. This is a highly desirable characteristic for robust system performance.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix}-20 & -60\\end{pmatrix}}$$", "id": "2709023"}, {"introduction": "While many introductory analyses focus on rational transfer functions, real-world systems often include time delays.

Because the delay $e^{-sT}$ does not alter open-loop magnitudes on the imaginary axis, increasing $T$ cannot change $N(T)$ and thus cannot destabilize the closed loop when $P=0$.", "solution": "The problem asks for an evaluation of several statements regarding the stability of a unity-feedback LTI system when a time delay is introduced in the open loop. The initial open-loop transfer function is $L_0(s)$, which is rational, strictly proper, with real coefficients, and has no poles in the open right-half plane (RHP). This implies the number of open-loop poles in the RHP, denoted by $P$, is $P=0$. The new open-loop transfer function with the time delay $T>0$ is $L_T(s) = L_0(s)e^{-sT}$.\n\nThe stability of the closed-loop system is determined by the Nyquist stability criterion. The number of closed-loop poles in the RHP, $Z$, is given by $Z = P - N_{ccw}$, where $N_{ccw}$ is the number of counter-clockwise (CCW) encirclements of the critical point $-1$ by the Nyquist plot of $L_T(s)$. The problem defines $N(T)$ as the number of clockwise (CW) encirclements, so $N(T) = -N_{ccw}$. Substituting this and $P=0$ into the criterion, we get $Z = 0 - (-N(T)) = N(T)$. The closed-loop system is stable if and only if $Z=0$, which implies $N(T)=0$.\n\nThe frequency response of the delayed system is $L_T(j\\omega) = L_0(j\\omega)e^{-j\\omega T}$. The term $e^{-j\\omega T}$ is a complex number with a magnitude of $1$ and a phase of $-\\omega T$ radians. Therefore, the magnitude and phase of $L_T(j\\omega)$ are related to those of $L_0(j\\omega)$ as follows:\n- Magnitude: $|L_T(j\\omega)| = |L_0(j\\omega)e^{-j\\omega T}| = |L_0(j\\omega)| |e^{-j\\omega T}| = |L_0(j\\omega)| \\cdot 1 = |L_0(j\\omega)|$.\n- Phase: $\\arg(L_T(j\\omega)) = \\arg(L_0(j\\omega)) + \\arg(e^{-j\\omega T}) = \\arg(L_0(j\\omega)) - \\omega T$.\n\nWe now evaluate each statement based on these principles.\n\n**A. The factor $e^{-sT}$ rotates the Nyquist plot of $L_{0}(j\\omega)$ by a constant angle that does not depend on $\\omega$, so $L_{T}(j\\omega)$ is a rigid rotation of $L_{0}(j\\omega)$ about the origin by the same angle for all $\\omega$.**\n\nThe phase shift introduced by the delay is $-\\omega T$. This angle is directly proportional to the frequency $\\omega$. It is not a constant angle for all $\\omega$ (unless $T=0$, which is excluded). For example, at $\\omega=0$, the phase shift is $0$. At $\\omega=1/T$, the phase shift is $-1$ radian. At $\\omega=2\\pi/T$, the phase shift is $-2\\pi$ radians. Since the angle of rotation depends on frequency, the transformation is a frequency-dependent \"warping\" of the plot, not a rigid rotation. Therefore, this statement is false.\n\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**B. For any fixed $T>0$ and frequency $\\omega\\in\\mathbb{R}$, $L_{T}(j\\omega)=L_{0}(j\\omega)e^{-j\\omega T}$ is obtained from $L_{0}(j\\omega)$ by preserving the magnitude and subtracting $\\omega T$ from the phase at that same $\\omega$; equivalently, the point at frequency $\\omega$ is rotated about the origin by the frequency-dependent angle $-\\omega T$.**\n\nThis statement is a direct and correct interpretation of the mathematical relationship between $L_T(j\\omega)$ and $L_0(j\\omega)$. As derived above, $|L_T(j\\omega)| = |L_0(j\\omega)|$, meaning the magnitude is preserved. Also, $\\arg(L_T(j\\omega)) = \\arg(L_0(j\\omega)) - \\omega T$, meaning the phase is shifted by $-\\omega T$. This corresponds to a clockwise rotation of the complex number $L_0(j\\omega)$ by an angle of $\\omega T$. The angle of rotation is indeed frequency-dependent.\n\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**C. As $T$ varies continuously, the integer $N(T)$ can change only at those values of $T$ for which there exists a frequency $\\omega\\in\\mathbb{R}$ satisfying the simultaneous conditions\n$$\n\\left|L_{0}(j\\omega)\\right|=1\n\\quad\\text{and}\\quad\n\\arg L_{0}(j\\omega)\\;-\\;\\omega T \\;\\equiv\\; \\pi \\pmod{2\\pi},\n$$\nthat is, precisely when the Nyquist plot passes through the point $-1$.**\n\nThe number of encirclements, $N(T)$, is an integer. For a continuous variation of the parameter $T$, the Nyquist plot deforms continuously. The only way for an integer-valued function like $N(T)$ to change its value is to pass through a point of discontinuity. For the winding number, this occurs if and only if the plot passes through the critical point it is supposed to encircle, which is $-1+j0$.\nThe condition $L_T(j\\omega) = -1$ can be expressed in terms of magnitude and phase. The complex number $-1$ has a magnitude of $1$ and a phase of $\\pi + 2k\\pi$ for any integer $k$.\n1. Magnitude condition: $|L_T(j\\omega)| = 1$. Since $|L_T(j\\omega)| = |L_0(j\\omega)|$, this is equivalent to $|L_0(j\\omega)| = 1$.\n2. Phase condition: $\\arg(L_T(j\\omega)) = \\pi + 2k\\pi$. Since $\\arg(L_T(j\\omega)) = \\arg(L_0(j\\omega)) - \\omega T$, this is equivalent to $\\arg(L_0(j\\omega)) - \\omega T = (2k+1)\\pi$, or $\\arg(L_0(j\\omega)) - \\omega T \\equiv \\pi \\pmod{2\\pi}$.\nThe statement correctly identifies these necessary and sufficient conditions for $N(T)$ to change.\n\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**D. At a generic crossing frequency $\\omega_{0}>0$ where $\\left|L_{0}(j\\omega_{0})\\right|=1$ with nonzero local slope in magnitude and finite local slope in phase, if $T$ is increased through the smallest positive $T^{\\star}$ that satisfies $\\arg L_{0}(j\\omega_{0})-\\omega_{0}T^{\\star}\\equiv\\pi\\pmod{2\\pi}$, then the net change in $N(T)$ across $T^{\\star}$ is exactly $\\pm 2$; the sign is determined by whether the Nyquist plot sweeps past $-1$ clockwise or counterclockwise as $T$ increases.**\n\nA change in stability corresponds to one or more closed-loop poles crossing the imaginary axis. Since the system transfer function has real coefficients, its poles must appear in complex conjugate pairs. A crossing at a frequency $\\omega_0 > 0$ implies that a pair of poles, $s = \\pm j\\omega_0$, crosses the imaginary axis. This means the number of closed-loop RHP poles, $Z$, changes by two ($\\Delta Z = \\pm 2$). The term \"generic crossing\" implies a simple, transversal crossing, so the change is exactly two, not zero or a larger even number.\nFrom the Nyquist criterion, we have the relation $Z = P + N(T)$. Since $P=0$, this simplifies to $Z = N(T)$.\nThe change in the number of encirclements must equal the change in the number of RHP poles: $\\Delta N(T) = \\Delta Z$.\nSince a pair of conjugate poles is crossing the imaginary axis, $\\Delta Z = \\pm 2$. Consequently, the change in the number of clockwise encirclements, $\\Delta N(T)$, must be $\\pm 2$.\n\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**E. If $\\left|L_{0}(j\\omega)\\right|\\neq 1$ for all $\\omega\\ge 0$, then $N(T)$ is independent of $T$ for all $T>0$.**\n\nAs established in the analysis of option C, the number of encirclements $N(T)$ can only change if the Nyquist plot of $L_T(j\\omega)$ passes through the point $-1$. A necessary condition for this is $|L_T(j\\omega)| = 1$. Since $|L_T(j\\omega)| = |L_0(j\\omega)|$, this condition becomes $|L_0(j\\omega)| = 1$.\nThe premise of this statement is that $|L_0(j\\omega)| \\neq 1$ for all $\\omega \\ge 0$. Since $|L_0(-j\\omega)| = |\\overline{L_0(j\\omega)}| = |L_0(j\\omega)|$, this holds for all real $\\omega$. This means the Nyquist plot of $L_T(s)$ can never have a magnitude of $1$ for any frequency $\\omega$ and any delay $T$. Therefore, it can never pass through the point $-1$.\nSince the plot never crosses the critical point as $T$ varies, the number of encirclements $N(T)$ must remain constant.\n\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**F. Because the delay $e^{-sT}$ does not alter open-loop magnitudes on the imaginary axis, increasing $T$ cannot change $N(T)$ and thus cannot destabilize the closed loop when $P=0$.**\n\nThis statement begins with a correct premise: the delay term $e^{-sT}$ does not alter the magnitude $|L_T(j\\omega)| = |L_0(j\\omega)|$. However, it draws a false conclusion from it.\nAs detailed in the analysis for C, a change in $N(T)$ requires both a magnitude and a phase condition to be met simultaneously. While the delay does not affect the magnitude, it adds a phase lag of $-\\omega T$. By increasing $T$, this additional phase lag can rotate a point on the Nyquist plot with magnitude $1$ until its total phase becomes $-\\pi$, causing it to land on the critical point $-1$. For any $T$ greater than this critical value, the plot will have crossed $-1$, potentially changing the number of encirclements and thus destabilizing the system. The reasoning in the statement is critically flawed because it completely ignores the phase-altering effect of the time delay.\n\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{BCDE}$$", "id": "2709006"}, {"introduction": "A bounded frequency response from reference to output might suggest a stable, well-behaved system, but this can be dangerously misleading.

The limits as $\\omega \\to \\pm\\infty$ are finite:\n$$\\lim_{\\omega \\to \\pm\\infty} |T(j\\omega)| = 3 \\sqrt{\\lim_{\\omega \\to \\pm\\infty} \\dfrac{1 + \\omega^2}{1 + 25\\omega^2}} = 3 \\sqrt{\\lim_{\\omega \\to \\pm\\infty} \\dfrac{1/\\omega^2 + 1}{1/\\omega^2 + 25}} = 3\\sqrt{\\dfrac{1}{25}} = \\dfrac{3}{5}$$\nSince the function is continuous and has finite limits, it is bounded on $\\mathbb{R}$.\n\nTo find the peak magnitude $M_T = \\sup_{\\omega \\in \\mathbb{R}} |T(j\\omega)|$, we must find the maximum value of the function. It is equivalent and simpler to find the maximum of its square, $|T(j\\omega)|^2$.\n$$|T(j\\omega)|^2 = 9 \\left( \\dfrac{1 + \\omega^2}{1 + 25\\omega^2} \\right)$$\nLet $x = \\omega^2$. Since $\\omega \\in \\mathbb{R}$, we have $x \\ge 0$. We analyze the function $f(x) = \\dfrac{1+x}{1+25x}$ for $x \\ge 0$. To find its extrema, we compute the derivative with respect to $x$:\n$$f'(x) = \\dfrac{d}{dx}\\left(\\dfrac{1+x}{1+25x}\\right) = \\dfrac{1 \\cdot (1+25x) - (1+x) \\cdot 25}{(1+25x)^2} = \\dfrac{1+25x - 25 - 25x}{(1+25x)^2} = \\dfrac{-24}{(1+25x)^2}$$\nFor all $x \\ge 0$, the denominator $(1+25x)^2$ is positive, so $f'(x)$ is strictly negative. This implies that $f(x)$ is a strictly decreasing function for $x \\ge 0$.\nThe maximum value of a strictly decreasing function on the interval $[0, \\infty)$ occurs at the left endpoint, $x=0$.\n$x=0$ corresponds to $\\omega^2 = 0$, which means $\\omega=0$. Therefore, the supremum of $|T(j\\omega)|$ is its value at $\\omega = 0$.\n$$M_T = |T(j \\cdot 0)| = 3 \\sqrt{\\dfrac{1 + 0^2}{1 + 25 \\cdot 0^2}} = 3 \\sqrt{\\dfrac{1}{1}} = 3$$\nAlternatively, evaluating $T(s)$ at $s=0$:\n$$T(0) = \\dfrac{3(0-1)}{5(0)-1} = \\dfrac{-3}{-1} = 3$$\nThus, $M_T = |T(0)| = 3$. This result demonstrates that despite the closed-loop system being unstable, its frequency response magnitude is bounded.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{3}$$", "id": "2709045"}]}
