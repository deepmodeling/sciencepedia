The expression to be evaluated is $(\\delta(t-t_{0})*x)(t)$.\n\nWe begin with the integral definition of convolution provided:\n$$(f*g)(t)=\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} f(\\tau)\\,g(t-\\tau)\\,d\\tau$$\nLet us identify $f(t)$ with the shifted Dirac delta distribution, $\\delta(t-t_{0})$, and $g(t)$ with the signal $x(t)$. Substituting these into the definition yields the formal integral expression for the convolution:\n$$(\\delta(t-t_{0})*x)(t) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\delta(\\tau-t_{0})\\,x(t-\\tau)\\,d\\tau$$\nThis integral must be interpreted in the sense of the theory of distributions, since the Dirac delta $\\delta(\\tau)$ is not a function in the traditional sense but an object defined by its action on a space of test functions.\n\nThe problem provides the defining sifting property of the Dirac delta distribution:\n$$\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\delta(\\tau-a)\\,\\varphi(\\tau)\\,d\\tau = \\varphi(a)$$\nThis property holds for any sufficiently well-behaved function $\\varphi$, specifically for any smooth, compactly supported test function. A comparison of the convolution integral with the sifting property integral suggests an identification. We can set the integration variable to be $\\tau$, the integration center to be $a=t_{0}$, and the function being acted upon to be $\\varphi(\\tau) = x(t-\\tau)$.\n\nHowever, a rigorous application of this property is not immediate. The function $\\varphi(\\tau) = x(t-\\tau)$ is, for a fixed $t$, a function of $\\tau$. The problem states that $x$ is only locally integrable ($x \\in L^{1}_{\\text{loc}}(\\mathbb{R})$), which means $\\varphi(\\tau)$ is not, in general, a smooth, compactly supported test function. Therefore, the straightforward application of the sifting property requires justification.\n\nThe justification proceeds from the rigorous definition of convolution involving distributions. The convolution of a distribution $S$ with compact support with a distribution $T$ is a well-defined distribution. The distribution corresponding to $\\delta(t-t_{0})$, which we denote by $\\delta_{t_{0}}$, has compact support, namely the singleton set $\\{t_0\\}$. The function $x \\in L^{1}_{\\text{loc}}(\\mathbb{R})$ defines a regular distribution, which we denote $T_x$. Thus, the convolution $\\delta_{t_{0}} * T_x$ is well-defined.\n\nTo identify the resulting distribution, we test it against an arbitrary smooth test function with compact support, $\\phi \\in C^{\\infty}_{c}(\\mathbb{R})$. Let $y(t) = (\\delta(t-t_{0})*x)(t)$. We must show that the distribution corresponding to $y(t)$ is the same as the distribution corresponding to the function $x(t-t_0)$. This is equivalent to showing that $\\langle y, \\phi \\rangle = \\langle x(\\cdot-t_{0}), \\phi \\rangle$ for all test functions $\\phi$.\n\nLet us evaluate both sides. The right-hand side is, by definition of the distribution associated with a locally integrable function:\n$$\\langle x(\\cdot-t_{0}), \\phi \\rangle = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} x(t-t_{0})\\,\\phi(t)\\,dt$$\nUsing a change of variables $u = t - t_{0}$ (so $t = u + t_{0}$ and $dt = du$), this becomes:\n$$\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} x(u)\\,\\phi(u+t_{0})\\,du$$\n\nNow we evaluate the left-hand side, $\\langle y, \\phi \\rangle = \\langle \\delta_{t_{0}} * T_x, \\phi \\rangle$. Using a fundamental property of convolution for distributions, $\\langle S * T, \\phi \\rangle = \\langle T, \\check{S} * \\phi \\rangle$, where $\\check{S}$ is the reflection of the distribution $S$, defined by $\\langle \\check{S}, \\phi \\rangle = \\langle S, \\check{\\phi} \\rangle$ with $\\check{\\phi}(t) = \\phi(-t)$. For $S = \\delta_{t_{0}}$, we have $\\check{S} = \\delta_{-t_{0}}$, the distribution for $\\delta(t+t_0)$. So:\n$$\\langle \\delta_{t_{0}} * T_x, \\phi \\rangle = \\langle T_x, \\delta_{-t_{0}} * \\phi \\rangle$$\nThe convolution $\\delta_{-t_{0}} * \\phi$ is a convolution of a distribution with a test function, which is a smooth function given by:\n$$(\\delta_{-t_{0}} * \\phi)(t) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\delta(\\tau+t_{0})\\,\\phi(t-\\tau)\\,d\\tau$$\nThis integral is of the form for which the sifting property is rigorously applicable, since for fixed $t$, the function $\\psi(\\tau) = \\phi(t-\\tau)$ is also a test function. The delta distribution is centered at $\\tau = -t_{0}$. Applying the sifting property, we get:\n$$(\\delta_{-t_{0}} * \\phi)(t) = \\phi(t - (-t_{0})) = \\phi(t+t_{0})$$\nSubstituting this result back, we have:\n$$\\langle \\delta_{t_{0}} * T_x, \\phi \\rangle = \\langle T_x, \\phi(\\cdot+t_{0}) \\rangle = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} x(t)\\,\\phi(t+t_{0})\\,dt$$\nComparing the results for the left-hand side and the right-hand side, we see they are identical. Since $\\langle y, \\phi \\rangle = \\langle x(\\cdot-t_{0}), \\phi \\rangle$ for all test functions $\\phi$, the distributions are equal. Therefore, the function resulting from the convolution is:\n$$(\\delta(t-t_{0})*x)(t) = x(t-t_{0})$$\nThis result is fundamental in the theory of linear time-invariant systems, where it shows that the Dirac delta impulse acts as the identity element for convolution, except for a time shift. The response of a system to a shifted impulse is the shifted impulse response of the system. In this problem, $x(t)$ convolves with an impulse, resulting in a shifted version of $x(t)$ itself. The procedure justifies treating the formal integral $\\int \\delta(\\tau-t_0) x(t-\\tau) d\\tau$ by directly applying the sifting property to the function $\\varphi(\\tau)=x(t-\\tau)$, even if $x$ is not smooth, provided the convolution is understood in the sense of distributions.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{x(t-t_{0})}\n$$", "id": "2712272"}, {"introduction": "Building on the abstract properties of convolution, we now connect the impulse response to the ubiquitous state-space representation.

All definitions, including the state-space model, causality, LTI properties, transfer functions, and the concepts of properness, are standard. The distinction between an impulse response that is a regular function and one that is a distribution containing a Dirac delta term is a cornerstone of this theory. The problem provides a precise, unambiguous definition for the quantity of interest, $h(0^{+})$, which isolates the non-impulsive behavior at the origin. The problem is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. It contains no contradictions, ambiguities, or factual unsoundness.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem statement is valid. A rigorous solution will now be derived.\n\n### Derivation of the Impulse Response and $h(0^{+})$\n\nThe impulse response, $h(t)$, is the output of the system when the input is a Dirac delta function, $u(t) = \\delta(t)$, and the initial state is zero, $x(0^{-})=0$.\n\nThe state equation is:\n$$ \\dot{x}(t) = A\\,x(t) + B\\,\\delta(t) $$\nWe integrate this equation from $t=0^{-}$ to $t=0^{+}$ to determine the effect of the impulsive input on the state vector.\n$$ \\int_{0^{-}}^{0^{+}} \\dot{x}(\\tau)\\,d\\tau = \\int_{0^{-}}^{0^{+}} A\\,x(\\tau)\\,d\\tau + \\int_{0^{-}}^{0^{+}} B\\,\\delta(\\tau)\\,d\\tau $$\nEvaluating each term:\n1.  The left-hand side is $x(0^{+}) - x(0^{-})$. Given $x(0^{-})=0$, this becomes $x(0^{+})$.\n2.  For the first term on the right-hand side, since the state vector $x(t)$ cannot change instantaneously without an impulsive forcing term in its derivative, $x(t)$ must be finite over the infinitesimal interval $[0^{-}, 0^{+}]$. Therefore, the integral of $A\\,x(\\tau)$ over this zero-width interval is zero: $\\int_{0^{-}}^{0^{+}} A\\,x(\\tau)\\,d\\tau = 0$.\n3.  For the second term on the right-hand side, using the sifting property of the Dirac delta function, $\\int_{0^{-}}^{0^{+}} B\\,\\delta(\\tau)\\,d\\tau = B$.\n\nCombining these results, we find the state vector immediately after the impulse:\n$$ x(0^{+}) = B $$\nFor time $t > 0$, the input $u(t)$ is zero, so the state evolves according to the homogeneous equation:\n$$ \\dot{x}(t) = A\\,x(t), \\quad t > 0 $$\nThe solution to this equation with the initial condition $x(0^{+})=B$ is:\n$$ x(t) = e^{At}\\,x(0^{+}) = e^{At}B \\quad \\text{for } t > 0 $$\nWe can express the state trajectory for all non-negative time using the Heaviside step function, $\\sigma(t)$, as $x(t) = e^{At}B\\,\\sigma(t)$. However, it is more precise to consider the output equation directly.\n\nThe output $y(t)$ is the impulse response $h(t)$:\n$$ h(t) = y(t) = C\\,x(t) + D\\,u(t) $$\nSubstituting $x(t)$ for $t > 0$ and $u(t)=\\delta(t)$:\n$$ h(t) = C\\,e^{At}B \\quad \\text{for } t > 0 $$\nThe complete impulse response, valid for $t \\ge 0$ in the sense of distributions, is:\n$$ h(t) = C\\,e^{At}B\\,\\sigma(t) + D\\,\\delta(t) $$\nThis expression clearly separates the response into a non-impulsive (or regular) part, $h_{reg}(t) = C\\,e^{At}B\\,\\sigma(t)$, and an impulsive part, $D\\,\\delta(t)$.\n\nThe problem defines $h(0^{+})$ as the right-hand limit of the non-impulsive part. We therefore calculate:\n$$ h(0^{+}) = \\lim_{t \\to 0^{+}} h_{reg}(t) = \\lim_{t \\to 0^{+}} (C\\,e^{At}B) $$\nSince $e^{At}$ is a continuous function of $t$, we can substitute $t=0$:\n$$ h(0^{+}) = C\\,e^{A \\cdot 0}B = C\\,I\\,B = C\\,B $$\nThis result, $h(0^{+})=C\\,B$, is derived from the fundamental state-space equations and holds for any LTI system described by this representation, irrespective of the value of $D$.\n\n### Evaluation of Options\n\n**A. In a strictly proper system, $\\,h(0^{+})\\,$ equals the instantaneous output induced by an impulse input and is given by $\\,C\\,B\\,$, whereas in a proper system with $\\,D\\neq 0\\,$, $\\,h(0^{+})\\,$ equals $\\,D\\,$ because the delta component dominates the right limit.**\nThe first part is correct: for a strictly proper system ($D=0$), $h(t) = C\\,e^{At}B\\,\\sigma(t)$, and $h(0^{+})=C\\,B$. The second part is incorrect. The value of $h(0^{+})$ is defined as the limit of the *non-impulsive* part, which we found to be $C\\,B$. The Dirac delta component does not \"dominate\" a right-hand limit of a function; it represents an impulse at exactly $t=0$ and is zero for any $t>0$. This option fundamentally misunderstands the mathematical nature of distributions. **Incorrect**.\n\n**B. In a strictly proper system, $\\,h(0^{+})\\,$ equals the finite output immediately after an impulse input and coincides with the right-derivative at $\\,t=0\\,$ of the unit-step response; in a proper system with $\\,D\\neq 0\\,$, $\\,h(0^{+})\\,$ still equals the right-limit of the non-impulsive part (equal to $\\,C\\,B\\,$ for any realization as above), while the impulsive output is represented separately by the term $\\,D\\,\\delta(t)\\,$ and is not included in $\\,h(0^{+})\\,$.**\nLet's analyze this statement piece by piece.\n- For a strictly proper system ($D=0$), $h(0^{+}) = C\\,B$. The output immediately after the impulse is $y(0^{+}) = C\\,x(0^{+}) + D\\,u(0^{+}) = C\\,B + 0 = C\\,B$. This matches. The unit-step response $y_{step}(t)$ has a derivative equal to the impulse response, $h(t)$. Thus, the right-derivative of $y_{step}(t)$ at $t=0$ is $\\lim_{t\\to 0^{+}} h(t) = h(0^{+})$. This is correct.\n- For a proper system ($D \\neq 0$), the statement claims $h(0^{+})$ is the limit of the non-impulsive part and equals $C\\,B$. Our derivation confirms this: $h(0^{+}) = C\\,B$. The statement correctly notes that the impulsive part $D\\,\\delta(t)$ is separate and not included in the calculation of $h(0^{+})$, which is precisely what the problem's definition of $h(0^{+})$ enforces. This option is entirely consistent with our derivation. **Correct**.\n\n**C. For any minimal realization, $\\,h(0^{+})=0\\,$ in the strictly proper case, while for a proper system with $\\,D\\neq 0\\,$ one has $\\,h(0^{+})=\\lim_{s\\to\\infty}G(s)=D\\,$.**\nThe first claim is false. $h(0^{+})=C\\,B$. There is no general principle stating that $C\\,B$ must be zero for a minimal, strictly proper system. For example, the system with $A=-1$, $B=1$, $C=1$, $D=0$ is minimal and strictly proper, yet $C\\,B=1 \\neq 0$. The second claim is also false. Our derivation showed $h(0^{+}) = C\\,B$. The quantity $\\lim_{s\\to\\infty}G(s)$ is equal to $D$, which is the coefficient of the impulsive part $\\delta(t)$, not the limit of the regular part $h(t)$ at $t \\to 0^+$. **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. For both strictly proper and proper systems, $\\,h(0^{+})\\,$ is undefined because $\\,h(t)\\,$ is a distribution; only integrals of the form $\\,\\int_{0}^{\\varepsilon} h(\\tau)\\,d\\tau\\,$ carry meaning.**\nThis statement is overly pedantic and, in the context of this problem, incorrect. The problem explicitly *defines* $h(0^{+})$ as the right-hand limit of the *non-impulsive part* of the response. The impulse response $h(t) = C\\,e^{At}B\\,\\sigma(t) + D\\,\\delta(t)$ has a well-defined non-impulsive (regular function) part, for which a limit can be taken. The problem's definition circumvents the issue of evaluating a distribution at a point. Therefore, $h(0^{+})$ is a well-defined quantity according to the rules of the problem. **Incorrect**.\n\n**E. In a proper system with $\\,D\\neq 0\\,$, $\\,h(0^{+})=C\\,B+D\\,$ since both the direct feedthrough and the state jump occur at $\\,t=0\\,$; in a strictly proper system, $\\,h(0^{+})=C\\,B\\,$.**\nThe second part is correct. The first part is incorrect. It erroneously combines the magnitude of the impulsive part ($D$) with the limit of the non-impulsive part ($C\\,B$). The definition of $h(0^{+})$ given in the problem statement explicitly requires us to consider only the non-impulsive part. Adding $D$ violates this definition. The state jump gives rise to the $C\\,B$ term, while the direct feedthrough $D\\,u(t)$ gives rise to the $D\\,\\delta(t)$ term. These are distinct contributions to the output. **Incorrect**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2712266"}, {"introduction": "Our final practice extends these concepts to the more general class of descriptor systems, which are described by differential-algebraic equations.

This is the structure corresponding to a nilpotent block of index $2$.\n\nThe equations for the algebraic part are:\n$$\\begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 0 & 0 \\end{bmatrix} \\begin{bmatrix} \\dot{x}_2(t) \\\\ \\dot{x}_3(t) \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{bmatrix} \\begin{bmatrix} x_2(t) \\\\ x_3(t) \\end{bmatrix} + \\begin{bmatrix} b_2 \\\\ b_3 \\end{bmatrix} u(t)$$\nThis expands to:\n1. $\\dot{x}_3(t) = x_2(t) + b_2 u(t)$\n2. $0 = x_3(t) + b_3 u(t)$\n\nThe second equation is a purely algebraic constraint. If $b_3 \\neq 0$, we can express $x_3(t)$ directly in terms of the input:\n$$x_3(t) = -b_3 u(t)$$\nDifferentiating this with respect to time gives:\n$$\\dot{x}_3(t) = -b_3 \\dot{u}(t)$$\nSubstituting this into the first equation allows us to solve for $x_2(t)$:\n$$-b_3 \\dot{u}(t) = x_2(t) + b_2 u(t) \\implies x_2(t) = -b_3 \\dot{u}(t) - b_2 u(t)$$\nThe algebraic states $x_2(t)$ and $x_3(t)$ are thus expressed as linear combinations of the input $u(t)$ and its derivative $\\dot{u}(t)$.\nThe output contribution from these states is $y_{alg}(t) = c_2 x_2(t) + c_3 x_3(t)$. Substituting the expressions for $x_2(t)$ and $x_3(t)$:\n$$y_{alg}(t) = c_2(-b_3 \\dot{u}(t) - b_2 u(t)) + c_3(-b_3 u(t)) = -c_2 b_3 \\dot{u}(t) - (c_2 b_2 + c_3 b_3)u(t)$$\nIn the Laplace domain, this corresponds to a transfer function for the algebraic part:\n$$G_{alg}(s) = -c_2 b_3 s - (c_2 b_2 + c_3 b_3)$$\nThis is a polynomial in $s$. The term $-c_2 b_3 s$ in the transfer function gives rise to a derivative of a delta, $-c_2 b_3 \\delta'(t)$, in the impulse response. This justifies how algebraic constraints induce polynomial terms in the frequency domain, which invert to distributional terms in the time domain.\n\n**Task 2: Computation of the Impulse Response**\n\nFor the specific system given, we have $B = [1, 0, 1]^T$ and $C = [3, 1, 2]$. Thus, $b_1=1, b_2=0, b_3=1$ and $c_1=3, c_2=1, c_3=2$. The scalar $D=0$.\n\nWe analyze the system by decomposing it into its constituent equations:\n$$E\\dot{x} = \\begin{bmatrix} \\dot{x}_1 \\\\ \\dot{x}_3 \\\\ 0 \\end{bmatrix} \\qquad Ax+Bu = \\begin{bmatrix} -2x_1+u \\\\ x_2 \\\\ x_3+u \\end{bmatrix}$$\nEquating these gives:\n1. (Dynamic Part) $\\dot{x}_1(t) = -2x_1(t) + u(t)$\n2. (Algebraic Part) $\\dot{x}_3(t) = x_2(t)$\n3. (Algebraic Part) $0 = x_3(t) + u(t)$\n\nFrom the algebraic constraint (3), we find $x_3(t)$:\n$$x_3(t) = -u(t)$$\nDifferentiating with respect to time yields $\\dot{x}_3(t) = -\\dot{u}(t)$. Substituting this into equation (2) gives $x_2(t)$:\n$$x_2(t) = -\\dot{u}(t)$$\n\nThe output $y(t)$ is given by $y(t) = Cx(t) = 3x_1(t) + 1x_2(t) + 2x_3(t)$. Substituting the expressions for $x_2(t)$ and $x_3(t)$:\n$$y(t) = 3x_1(t) - \\dot{u}(t) - 2u(t)$$\nThe impulse response $g(t)$ is the output $y(t)$ when the input is the Dirac delta distribution, $u(t)=\\delta(t)$.\nThe response of the dynamic part, $x_1(t)$, to the input $u(t)=\\delta(t)$ is its own impulse response, $h_1(t)$. For the equation $\\dot{x}_1+2x_1=\\delta(t)$, the solution is $x_1(t) = e^{-2t}H(t)$.\nFor the distributional terms, we have $u(t) = \\delta(t)$ and $\\dot{u}(t) = \\delta'(t)$.\nSubstituting these into the expression for $y(t)$ gives the overall impulse response $g(t)$:\n$$g(t) = 3(e^{-2t}H(t)) - \\delta'(t) - 2\\delta(t)$$\nThe term $3e^{-2t}H(t)$ arises from the dynamic part of the system. The terms $-\\delta'(t) - 2\\delta(t)$ arise from the algebraic constraints.\n\nTo verify, we can compute the transfer function $G(s) = \\mathcal{L}\\{g(t)\\}$:\n$$G(s) = 3\\mathcal{L}\\{e^{-2t}H(t)\\} - \\mathcal{L}\\{\\delta'(t)\\} - 2\\mathcal{L}\\{\\delta(t)\\} = \\frac{3}{s+2} - s - 2$$\nThis result is consistent.\n\n**Task 3: Condition for the Appearance of $\\delta'(t)$**\n\nBased on the general derivation in Task 1, the output contains a term proportional to $\\dot{u}(t)$:\n$$y(t) = (\\dots) - c_2 b_3 \\dot{u}(t) + (\\dots)$$\nThe impulse response $g(t)$ is the output for $u(t)=\\delta(t)$, so this term becomes $-c_2 b_3 \\delta'(t)$.\nFor a $\\delta'(t)$ term to be present in the impulse response, its coefficient must be non-zero.\nIn the canonical structure given by matrices $E$ and $A$, the state $x_2$ is proportional to the derivative of the input, provided that the input directly affects the algebraic constraint on $x_3$. This occurs when $b_3 \\neq 0$. The derivative term then appears in the output if this state $x_2$ is observed, which occurs when $c_2 \\neq 0$.\nTherefore, the necessary and sufficient condition for a $\\delta'(t)$ term to appear in the impulse response is that the product of these coefficients is non-zero:\n$$c_2 b_3 \\neq 0$$\nFor the specific system problem, $c_2=1$ and $b_3=1$, so the condition $1 \\cdot 1 \\neq 0$ is met, which is why a $\\delta'(t)$ term appears in our calculated response.\n\nThe final answer is the explicit closed-form expression for the impulse response $g(t)$.\n$$g(t) = 3e^{-2t}H(t) - 2\\delta(t) - \\delta'(t)$$", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{3\\exp(-2t)H(t) - 2\\delta(t) - \\delta'(t)}\n$$", "id": "2712284"}]}
