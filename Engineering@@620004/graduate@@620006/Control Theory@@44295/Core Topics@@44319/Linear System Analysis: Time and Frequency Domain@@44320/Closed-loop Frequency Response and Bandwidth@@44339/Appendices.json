This represents a feedback loop between the perturbation $\\Delta_{M}(s)$ and the transfer function $M(s) = -T(s)W_{M}(s)$. By the small-gain theorem, stability is guaranteed for all $\\|\\Delta_{M}\\|_{\\infty} \\leq 1$ if $\\|T(s)W_{M}(s)\\|_{\\infty} < 1$. This is equivalent to the required form $\\sup_{\\omega} |W_{T}(j\\omega)T(j\\omega)| < 1$, where the effective weight for the multiplicative uncertainty is $W_{T, \\text{mult}}(s) = W_{M}(s)$.\n\nFor the additive uncertainty model, the perturbed plant is $G(s) = G_{0}(s) + W_{A}(s)\\Delta_{A}(s)$. The perturbed loop transfer function is $L_{pert}(s) = (G_{0}(s) + W_{A}(s)\\Delta_{A}(s))K(s) = L(s) + W_{A}(s)\\Delta_{A}(s)K(s)$.\nThe characteristic equation is $1 + L_{pert}(s) = 1 + L(s) + W_{A}(s)\\Delta_{A}(s)K(s)$.\nFactoring out $(1 + L(s))$ gives:\n$1 + L_{pert}(s) = (1 + L(s)) \\left[ 1 + \\frac{1}{1 + L(s)} W_{A}(s)K(s)\\Delta_{A}(s) \\right] = (1 + L(s))(1 + S(s)W_{A}(s)K(s)\\Delta_{A}(s))$.\nRobust stability is guaranteed if $\\|S(s)W_{A}(s)K(s)\\|_{\\infty} < 1$. To express this condition in terms of $T(s)$, we use the relation $L(s) = G_{0}(s)K(s)$, which implies $K(s) = G_{0}(s)^{-1}L(s)$, assuming $G_{0}(s)$ is invertible. The given $G_0(s)$ is minimum-phase and thus has a stable inverse.\nSubstituting $K(s)$:\n$S(s)W_{A}(s)K(s) = S(s)W_{A}(s)G_{0}(s)^{-1}L(s) = W_{A}(s)G_{0}(s)^{-1} \\frac{L(s)}{1+L(s)} = W_{A}(s)G_{0}(s)^{-1}T(s)$.\nThe robust stability condition becomes $\\|W_{A}(s)G_{0}(s)^{-1}T(s)\\|_{\\infty} < 1$. This is of the form $\\sup_{\\omega} |W_{T}(j\\omega)T(j\\omega)| < 1$, where the effective weight for the additive uncertainty is $W_{T, \\text{add}}(s) = W_{A}(s)G_{0}(s)^{-1}$.\n\nTask 2: Computation of Maximum Bandwidth $\\omega_{b}$\n\nWe now substitute the specific forms of the transfer functions. The limiting condition for stability is $\\sup_{\\omega} |W_{T}(j\\omega)T(j\\omega)| = 1$.\nGiven:\n$T(s) = \\frac{\\omega_{b}}{s + \\omega_{b}} \\implies |T(j\\omega)| = \\frac{\\omega_{b}}{\\sqrt{\\omega^{2} + \\omega_{b}^{2}}}$\n$G_{0}(s) = \\frac{g}{\\tau s + 1}$. With $\\omega_{h} = 1/\\tau$, this is $G_{0}(s) = \\frac{g}{s/\\omega_{h} + 1} = \\frac{g\\omega_{h}}{s + \\omega_{h}}$.\n$G_{0}(s)^{-1} = \\frac{s + \\omega_{h}}{g\\omega_{h}}$.\n$W_{M}(s) = \\alpha \\frac{s}{s + \\omega_{h}} \\implies |W_{M}(j\\omega)| = \\frac{\\alpha\\omega}{\\sqrt{\\omega^{2} + \\omega_{h}^{2}}}$.\n$W_{A}(s) = \\beta \\frac{s}{s + \\omega_{h}} \\implies |W_{A}(j\\omega)| = \\frac{\\beta\\omega}{\\sqrt{\\omega^{2} + \\omega_{h}^{2}}}$.\n\nCase 1: Multiplicative Uncertainty. The condition is $\\sup_{\\omega} |W_{M}(j\\omega)T(j\\omega)| = 1$.\nLet $f_{M}(\\omega) = |W_{M}(j\\omega)T(j\\omega)| = \\frac{\\alpha\\omega}{\\sqrt{\\omega^{2} + \\omega_{h}^{2}}} \\frac{\\omega_{b}}{\\sqrt{\\omega^{2} + \\omega_{b}^{2}}} = \\frac{\\alpha\\omega_{b}\\omega}{\\sqrt{(\\omega^{2} + \\omega_{h}^{2})(\\omega^{2} + \\omega_{b}^{2})}}$.\nTo find the maximum, we can maximize $f_{M}(\\omega)^{2}$ with respect to $x = \\omega^{2}$.\n$f_{M}(\\omega)^{2} = \\frac{(\\alpha\\omega_{b})^{2}x}{(x + \\omega_{h}^{2})(x + \\omega_{b}^{2})}$.\nSetting the derivative with respect to $x$ to zero gives the numerator condition:\n$(x + \\omega_{h}^{2})(x + \\omega_{b}^{2}) - x( (x + \\omega_{h}^{2}) + (x + \\omega_{b}^{2}) ) = 0$.\n$x^{2} + (\\omega_{h}^{2}+\\omega_{b}^{2})x + \\omega_{h}^{2}\\omega_{b}^{2} - 2x^{2} - (\\omega_{h}^{2}+\\omega_{b}^{2})x = 0$.\nThis simplifies to $-x^{2} + \\omega_{h}^{2}\\omega_{b}^{2} = 0$, so the maximum occurs at $x_{max} = \\omega_{h}\\omega_{b}$, which corresponds to $\\omega_{max} = \\sqrt{\\omega_{h}\\omega_{b}}$.\nSubstituting this frequency back into $f_{M}(\\omega)$:\n$\\sup_{\\omega} f_{M}(\\omega) = f_{M}(\\omega_{max}) = \\frac{\\alpha\\omega_{b}\\sqrt{\\omega_{h}\\omega_{b}}}{\\sqrt{(\\omega_{h}\\omega_{b} + \\omega_{h}^{2})(\\omega_{h}\\omega_{b} + \\omega_{b}^{2})}} = \\frac{\\alpha\\omega_{b}\\sqrt{\\omega_{h}\\omega_{b}}}{\\sqrt{\\omega_{h}(\\omega_{b} + \\omega_{h})\\omega_{b}(\\omega_{h} + \\omega_{b})}} = \\frac{\\alpha\\omega_{b}\\sqrt{\\omega_{h}\\omega_{b}}}{(\\omega_{h} + \\omega_{b})\\sqrt{\\omega_{h}\\omega_{b}}} = \\frac{\\alpha\\omega_{b}}{\\omega_{h} + \\omega_{b}}$.\nSetting this maximum value to $1$ to find the bandwidth limit $\\omega_{b, \\text{mult}}$:\n$\\frac{\\alpha\\omega_{b, \\text{mult}}}{\\omega_{h} + \\omega_{b, \\text{mult}}} = 1 \\implies \\alpha\\omega_{b, \\text{mult}} = \\omega_{h} + \\omega_{b, \\text{mult}} \\implies (\\alpha - 1)\\omega_{b, \\text{mult}} = \\omega_{h}$.\n$\\omega_{b, \\text{mult}} = \\frac{\\omega_{h}}{\\alpha - 1}$. Given $\\omega_{h} = 1/\\tau$, we have $\\omega_{b, \\text{mult}} = \\frac{1}{\\tau(\\alpha - 1)}$.\n\nCase 2: Additive Uncertainty. The condition is $\\sup_{\\omega} |W_{A}(j\\omega)G_{0}(j\\omega)^{-1}T(j\\omega)| = 1$.\nFirst, we find the effective weight magnitude:\n$W_{T, \\text{add}}(s) = W_{A}(s)G_{0}(s)^{-1} = \\left(\\beta \\frac{s}{s + \\omega_{h}}\\right) \\left(\\frac{s + \\omega_{h}}{g\\omega_{h}}\\right) = \\frac{\\beta s}{g\\omega_{h}}$.\n$|W_{T, \\text{add}}(j\\omega)| = \\frac{\\beta \\omega}{g\\omega_{h}}$.\nNow we compute the magnitude of the full expression:\n$f_{A}(\\omega) = |W_{T, \\text{add}}(j\\omega)T(j\\omega)| = \\frac{\\beta \\omega}{g\\omega_{h}} \\frac{\\omega_{b}}{\\sqrt{\\omega^{2} + \\omega_{b}^{2}}} = \\frac{\\beta \\omega_{b}}{g\\omega_{h}} \\frac{\\omega}{\\sqrt{\\omega^{2} + \\omega_{b}^{2}}}$.\nThe term $\\frac{\\omega}{\\sqrt{\\omega^{2} + \\omega_{b}^{2}}}$ is a monotonically increasing function of $\\omega$ for $\\omega \\geq 0$. Its value ranges from $0$ at $\\omega=0$ to $1$ as $\\omega \\to \\infty$.\nTherefore, the supremum of $f_{A}(\\omega)$ is its limit as $\\omega \\to \\infty$:\n$\\sup_{\\omega} f_{A}(\\omega) = \\lim_{\\omega \\to \\infty} \\frac{\\beta \\omega_{b}}{g\\omega_{h}} \\frac{\\omega}{\\sqrt{\\omega^{2} + \\omega_{b}^{2}}} = \\frac{\\beta \\omega_{b}}{g\\omega_{h}} \\times 1 = \\frac{\\beta \\omega_{b}}{g\\omega_{h}}$.\nSetting this supremum to $1$ to find the bandwidth limit $\\omega_{b, \\text{add}}$:\n$\\frac{\\beta \\omega_{b, \\text{add}}}{g\\omega_{h}} = 1 \\implies \\omega_{b, \\text{add}} = \\frac{g\\omega_{h}}{\\beta}$.\nGiven $\\omega_{h} = 1/\\tau$, we have $\\omega_{b, \\text{add}} = \\frac{g}{\\beta\\tau}$.\n\nTask 3: Final Answer\nThe final results for the maximum admissible bandwidth under the additive and multiplicative uncertainty models are $\\omega_{b,\\mathrm{add}} = \\frac{g}{\\beta\\tau}$ and $\\omega_{b,\\mathrm{mult}} = \\frac{1}{\\tau(\\alpha-1)}$, respectively. These are to be presented as a two-entry row vector $[\\omega_{b,\\mathrm{add}} \\ \\ \\omega_{b,\\mathrm{mult}}]$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n\\frac{g}{\\beta \\tau} & \\frac{1}{\\tau(\\alpha-1)}\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$"}]}
