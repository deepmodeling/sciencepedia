We may proceed with the solution.\n\nThe error signal in a unity-feedback control system is defined as the difference between the reference input, $r(t)$, and the system output, $y(t)$. In the Laplace domain, this relationship is expressed as $E(s) = R(s) - Y(s)$. In a unity-feedback loop, the output is related to the error signal by $Y(s) = G(s) E(s)$, where $G(s)$ is the open-loop transfer function.
