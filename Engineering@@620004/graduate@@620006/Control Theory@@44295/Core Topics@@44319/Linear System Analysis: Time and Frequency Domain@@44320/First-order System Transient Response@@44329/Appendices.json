A rigorous solution can be derived.\n\nWe begin by solving the differential equation to find the system's response $y(t)$. The Laplace transform method is suitable. The transfer function $H(s)$ of the system is found from the differential equation by taking the Laplace transform with zero initial conditions:\n$$\n\\tau sY(s) + Y(s) = K X(s) \\implies (\\tau s + 1)Y(s) = K X(s)\n$$\n$$\nH(s) = \\frac{Y(s)}{X(s)} = \\frac{K}{\\tau s + 1}\n$$\nThe system is stable because its single pole at $s = -1/\\tau$ is in the left-half of the complex plane, as we are given $\\tau > 0$.\n\nThe input is $x(t) = A u(t)$, so its Laplace transform is $X(s) = A/s$.

We are also given $A>0$ and $\\tau>0$.\n\n1.  **Sign of $y(t)$ for $t > 0$**:\n    The product $KA$ is negative since $K<0$ and $A>0$. For $t>0$ and $\\tau>0$, the exponent $-t/\\tau$ is negative, which means $0 < e^{-t/\\tau} < 1$. Consequently, the term $(1 - e^{-t/\\tau})$ is strictly positive and its value is between $0$ and $1$. The product of a negative number ($KA$) and a positive number ($(1 - e^{-t/\\tau})$) is always negative. Therefore, $y(t) < 0$ for all $t > 0$.\n\n2.  **Monotonicity of $y(t)$ for $t > 0$**:\n    We examine the derivative of $y(t)$ with respect to time:\n    $$\n    \\dot{y}(t) = \\frac{d}{dt}\\left[KA(1 - e^{-t/\\tau})\\right] = KA\\left( - (-\\frac{1}{\\tau})e^{-t/\\tau} \\right) = \\frac{KA}{\\tau}e^{-t/\\tau}\n    $$\n    The sign of $\\dot{y}(t)$ depends on the sign of the term $KA/\\tau$. Since $K<0$, $A>0$, and $\\tau>0$, this term is negative. The exponential term $e^{-t/\\tau}$ is always positive for any finite $t$. Thus, $\\dot{y}(t) < 0$ for all $t > 0$. This proves that $y(t)$ is a strictly decreasing function for $t > 0$. The response starts at $y(0) = KA(1 - e^0) = 0$ and decreases towards its final value.\n\n3.  **Final Value and Overshoot**:\n    The final value is $y(\\infty) = \\lim_{t\\to\\infty} y(t) = \\lim_{t\\to\\infty} KA(1 - e^{-t/\\tau}) = KA(1-0) = KA$. Since $K<0$ and $A>0$, the final value is negative, $y(\\infty) < 0$.\n    Overshoot is defined to occur if there exists a time $t>0$ such that $y(t) < y(\\infty)$. Let us check this condition:\n    $$\n    y(t) < KA\n    $$\n    $$\n    KA(1 - e^{-t/\\tau}) < KA\n    $$\n    Since $KA$ is a negative quantity, dividing by it reverses the inequality sign:\n    $$\n    1 - e^{-t/\\tau} > 1\n    $$\n    $$\n    -e^{-t/\\tau} > 0\n    $$\n    $$\n    e^{-t/\\tau} < 0\n    $$\n    This inequality is impossible, as the exponential function $e^x$ yields a positive value for any real argument $x$. Therefore, overshoot relative to the final value cannot occur. The response $y(t)$ monotonically approaches the final value $y(\\infty)=KA$ from above (i.e., from $y(0)=0$).\n\n**Evaluation of Options**\n\n*   **A.

The response $y(t)$ is initially negative but necessarily becomes more negative than $y(\\infty)$ (undershoots) when $\\tau$ is sufficiently small; overshoot relative to $y(\\infty)$ can therefore occur.**\n    Our analysis shows that overshoot never occurs, for any value of $\\tau > 0$. The time constant $\\tau$ only affects the speed of the response, not its fundamental monotonic character. A first-order system response to a step input is always monotonic.\n    **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n*   **C. Because the input step is positive, $y(t)$ must be initially positive for small $t>0$, then crosses zero and approaches $y(\\infty)=K A<0$; depending on $K$, overshoot relative to $y(\\infty)$ may occur.**\n    The premise that $y(t)$ must be initially positive is false. The initial slope is $\\dot{y}(0^+) = KA/\\tau$. As $K<0$, $A>0$, and $\\tau>0$, the initial slope is negative. The response starts at $y(0)=0$ and immediately becomes negative. It never becomes positive.\n    **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n*   **D. The response $y(t)$ is nonpositive and monotonic, but for sufficiently large $|K|$ it overshoots below $y(\\infty)$ before returning asymptotically to $y(\\infty)$.**\n    The response of a first-order system to a step input is always monotonic. It cannot overshoot and then return to the final value. This type of behavior is characteristic of second-order underdamped systems, not first-order systems. The magnitude of $K$ only scales the amplitude of the response and does not introduce overshoot.\n    **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\nBased on the rigorous derivation, only option A is a correct characterization of the system response.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$"}]}
