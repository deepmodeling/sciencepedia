No rounding is required.", "solution": "The derivation of the steady-state error, $e_{\\mathrm{ss}}$, proceeds from the fundamental principles stipulated in the problem statement.\n\nFirst, we establish the relationship for the error signal in the Laplace domain. For a unity negative-feedback system, the error $e(t)$ and its Laplace transform $E(s)$ are defined by:\n$$e(t) = r(t) - y(t)$$\n$$E(s) = R(s) - Y(s)$$\nwhere $R(s) = \\mathcal{L}\\{r(t)\\}$ and $Y(s) = \\mathcal{L}\\{y(t)\\}$. The output $Y(s)$ is related to the error signal $E(s)$ through the forward-path transfer function $L(s)$:\n$$Y(s) = L(s) E(s)$$\nSubstituting this expression for $Y(s)$ into the equation for $E(s)$ gives:\n$$E(s) = R(s) - L(s) E(s)$$\nWe solve for $E(s)$:\n$$E(s)(1 + L(s)) = R(s)$$\n$$E(s) = \\frac{R(s)}{1 + L(s)}$$\nThis is the transfer function from the reference input to the error.\n\nSecond, we identify the Laplace transform of the input signal. The input is a unit step function, $r(t)=1$ for $t \\ge 0$. Its Laplace transform is:\n$$R(s) = \\mathcal{L}\\{1(t)\\} = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} 1 \\cdot \\exp(-st) \\, dt = \\left[ -\\frac{1}{s}\\exp(-st) \\right]_{0}^{\\infty} = 0 - \\left(-\\frac{1}{s}\\right) = \\frac{1}{s}$$\n\nThird, we apply the Final Value Theorem (FVT) to find the steady-state error, $e_{\\mathrm{ss}}$. The FVT states that if all poles of $sE(s)$ are in the open left-half of the complex plane, then:\n$$e_{\\mathrm{ss}} = \\lim_{t\\to\\infty} e(t) = \\lim_{s\\to 0} s E(s)$$\nThe problem statement guarantees the asymptotic stability of the closed-loop system, which means all poles of the closed-loop transfer function $\\frac{Y(s)}{R(s)} = \\frac{L(s)}{1+L(s)}$ lie in the open left-half complex plane. The poles of $E(s) = \\frac{R(s)}{1+L(s)}$ are the poles of the closed-loop system plus the poles of $R(s)$. Since $R(s) = \\frac{1}{s}$, $E(s)$ has a simple pole at $s=0$ and all other poles are in the open left-half plane. Therefore, the FVT is applicable.\n\nSubstituting the expressions for $E(s)$ and $R(s)$ into the FVT formula yields:\n$$e_{\\mathrm{ss}} = \\lim_{s\\to 0} s \\left( \\frac{R(s)}{1 + L(s)} \\right) = \\lim_{s\\to 0} s \\left( \\frac{1/s}{1 + L(s)} \\right)$$\n$$e_{\\mathrm{ss}} = \\lim_{s\\to 0} \\frac{1}{1 + L(s)}$$\nThe existence of this limit depends on the limit of $L(s)$ as $s \\to 0$. We can evaluate this by direct substitution.\n\nFourth, we compute the limit of the given forward-path transfer function $L(s)$ as $s$ approaches $0$:\n$$L(s) = \\frac{k\\,s\\,(\\tau s + 1)}{(s+a)(s+b)}$$\nThe limit is:\n$$\\lim_{s\\to 0} L(s) = \\lim_{s\\to 0} \\frac{k\\,s\\,(\\tau s + 1)}{(s+a)(s+b)} = \\frac{k \\cdot 0 \\cdot (\\tau \\cdot 0 + 1)}{(0+a)(0+b)}$$\nGiven the constraints $a>0$ and $b>0$, the denominator is $ab$, which is a finite non-zero value. The numerator is $0$. Thus, the limit is:\n$$\\lim_{s\\to 0} L(s) = 0$$\nThis value is known as the static position error constant, $K_p$.\n\nFinally, we substitute this result back into the expression for $e_{\\mathrm{ss}}$:\n$$e_{\\mathrm{ss}} = \\frac{1}{1 + \\lim_{s\\to 0} L(s)} = \\frac{1}{1 + 0} = 1$$\nThe steady-state error to a unit step input is $1$. This is because the forward-path transfer function has a zero at $s=0$, which nullifies its DC gain. Consequently, the system cannot track a constant reference signal, and the steady-state output $y_{\\mathrm{ss}}$ is $0$. The error $e_{\\mathrm{ss}} = r_{\\mathrm{ss}} - y_{\\mathrm{ss}} = 1 - 0 = 1$.
