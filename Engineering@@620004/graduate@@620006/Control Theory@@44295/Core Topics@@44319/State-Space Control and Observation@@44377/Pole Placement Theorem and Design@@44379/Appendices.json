Therefore, the complete characteristic polynomial of the internal system is:\n$$D_{cl}(s) = (s-2)(s+4)(s+6)$$\nThe poles of the internal system are the roots of $D_{cl}(s) = 0$, which are $s_1=2$, $s_2=-4$, and $s_3=-6$.\nSince there is a pole at $s=2$, which is in the right-half plane, the closed-loop system is **internally unstable**.\nThe unstable mode at $s=2$ was \"hidden\" in the input-output map $Y(s)/R(s)$ due to the pole-zero cancellation. However, this mode is not eliminated from the system dynamics. It would be excited by initial conditions of the plant state corresponding to this mode, or by disturbances injected at the plant input. This cancellation of an unstable RHP pole with a RHP zero is a fundamentally flawed design practice that results in internal instability.
