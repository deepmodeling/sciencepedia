The problem is well-defined, scientifically sound, and contains all necessary information for a unique solution. We shall proceed with the derivation.\n\nThe system dynamics are given by:\n$$ \\dot{x}(t) = A x(t) + B u(t) + G w(t) $$\n$$ y(t) = C x(t) + v(t) $$\nwith matrices, cost function weights, and noise covariances:\n$$ A = \\begin{pmatrix} 0.5 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1.5 \\end{pmatrix},\\ B = I_{2}, \\ C = I_{2}, \\ G = I_{2} $$\n$$ Q = 3 I_{2},\\ R = 4 I_{2},\\ W = \\begin{pmatrix} 3 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 7 \\end{pmatrix},\\ V = 4 I_{2} $$\nwhere $I_{2}$ is the $2 \\times 2$ identity matrix.\n\nFirst, we compute the steady-state LQR gain $F$. The gain is given by $F = R^{-1} B^{\\top} P$, where $P$ is the unique, symmetric, positive-semidefinite solution to the continuous-time Algebraic Riccati Equation (CARE):\n$$ A^{\\top} P + P A - P B R^{-1} B^{\\top} P + Q = 0 $$\nGiven that $A$, $B$, $R$, and $Q$ are all diagonal matrices, the solution $P$ must also be diagonal. Let $P = \\text{diag}(p_1, p_2)$. The matrix equation decouples into two independent scalar algebraic Riccati equations.\nWith $R^{-1} = \\frac{1}{4}I_2$ and $B=I_2$, we have $B R^{-1} B^{\\top} = \\frac{1}{4}I_2$.\n\nFor the first diagonal element, $p_1$:\n$$ 2(0.5)p_1 - p_1(\\frac{1}{4})p_1 + 3 = 0 \\implies \\frac{1}{4}p_1^2 - p_1 - 3 = 0 \\implies p_1^2 - 4p_1 - 12 = 0 $$\nFactoring yields $(p_1 - 6)(p_1 + 2) = 0$. For $P$ to be positive-semidefinite, we must choose the non-negative root, so $p_1 = 6$.\n\nFor the second diagonal element, $p_2$:\n$$ 2(-1.5)p_2 - p_2(\\frac{1}{4})p_2 + 3 = 0 \\implies \\frac{1}{4}p_2^2 + 3p_2 - 3 = 0 \\implies p_2^2 + 12p_2 - 12 = 0 $$\nUsing the quadratic formula, $p_2 = \\frac{-12 \\pm \\sqrt{12^2 - 4(1)(-12)}}{2} = \\frac{-12 \\pm \\sqrt{144 + 48}}{2} = \\frac{-12 \\pm \\sqrt{192}}{2}$.

Since $A$, $C$, $V$, and $Q_{noise}$ are diagonal, $S$ must also be diagonal. Let $S = \\text{diag}(s_1, s_2)$. With $V^{-1} = \\frac{1}{4}I_2$ and $C=I_2$, we have $C^{\\top} V^{-1} C = \\frac{1}{4}I_2$. The matrix equation decouples.\n\nFor the first diagonal element, $s_1$:\n$$ 2(0.5)s_1 - s_1(\\frac{1}{4})s_1 + 3 = 0 \\implies \\frac{1}{4}s_1^2 - s_1 - 3 = 0 \\implies s_1^2 - 4s_1 - 12 = 0 $$\nThis is identical to the equation for $p_1$, so $s_1 = 6$.\n\nFor the second diagonal element, $s_2$:\n$$ 2(-1.5)s_2 - s_2(\\frac{1}{4})s_2 + 7 = 0 \\implies \\frac{1}{4}s_2^2 + 3s_2 - 7 = 0 \\implies s_2^2 + 12s_2 - 28 = 0 $$\nFactoring yields $(s_2 + 14)(s_2 - 2) = 0$. For $S$ to be positive-semidefinite, we must choose the non-negative root, so $s_2 = 2$.\nThus, $S = \\begin{pmatrix} 6 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 2 \\end{pmatrix}$.\nThe Kalman gain is $L = S C^{\\top} V^{-1} = S \\cdot I_2 \\cdot \\frac{1}{4}I_2 = \\frac{1}{4}S$.\n$$ L = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{3}{2} & 0 \\\\ 0 & \\frac{1}{2} \\end{pmatrix} $$\n\nNow, we construct the autonomous augmented system. The control law is $u(t) = -F \\hat{x}(t)$. The state equation becomes $\\dot{x} = Ax - BF\\hat{x}$. The estimation error is $e(t) = x(t) - \\hat{x}(t)$. The dynamics of the error are derived from $\\dot{e} = \\dot{x} - \\dot{\\hat{x}}$.\nFor the deterministic part of the analysis (setting $w(t)=0, v(t)=0$), we have $y(t) = C x(t)$.\n$$ \\dot{\\hat{x}} = A\\hat{x} + Bu + L(y-C\\hat{x}) = A\\hat{x} - BF\\hat{x} + L(Cx - C\\hat{x}) $$\n$$ \\dot{e} = (Ax-BF\\hat{x}) - (A\\hat{x} - BF\\hat{x} + LCx - LC\\hat{x}) = A(x-\\hat{x}) - LC(x-\\hat{x}) = (A-LC)e $$\nThe state dynamics can be written in terms of $x$ and $e$ by substituting $\\hat{x} = x-e$:\n$$ \\dot{x} = Ax - BF(x-e) = (A-BF)x + BFe $$\nThe augmented system with state $\\xi(t) = \\begin{pmatrix} x(t) \\\\ e(t) \\end{pmatrix}$ is:\n$$ \\dot{\\xi}(t) = \\begin{pmatrix} \\dot{x} \\\\ \\dot{e} \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} A-BF & BF \\\\ \\mathbf{0} & A-LC \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} x \\\\ e \\end{pmatrix} $$\nThe system matrix is $M = \\begin{pmatrix} A-BF & BF \\\\ \\mathbf{0} & A-LC \\end{pmatrix}$.\nThe eigenvalues of a block triangular matrix are the eigenvalues of its diagonal blocks.

It provides a standard discrete-time LTI state-space model with clearly specified system and noise matrices. The concepts of stabilizability, detectability, and the separation principle are central to modern control theory. The question asks for an analysis of these concepts for the given system. The specific properties of the matrices ($A$ being unstable and diagonal, $C$ having a zero row, $V$ being singular) are designed to test a non-trivial understanding of these conditions. The problem is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. It contains no contradictions or missing information.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem statement is valid. A full solution will be derived.\n\n**Derivation**\n\nThe applicability of the separation principle to form a stabilizing output-feedback controller hinges on two fundamental properties: the stabilizability of the pair $(A,B)$ and the detectability of the pair $(A,C)$.\n\n**1. Analysis of Stabilizability for the pair $(A,B)$**\n\nA system is stabilizable if all its unstable modes are controllable. The matrix $A$ is diagonal, so its eigenvalues are its diagonal entries: $\\lambda_1 = 1.1$ and $\\lambda_2 = 0.5$. Since $|\\lambda_1| = 1.1 > 1$, the first mode is unstable. Since $|\\lambda_2| = 0.5 < 1$, the second mode is stable.\n\nTo check for stabilizability, we must determine if the unstable mode corresponding to $\\lambda_1 = 1.1$ is controllable. We use the Popov-Hautus-Belevitch (PHB) test. The pair $(A,B)$ is stabilizable if and only if the matrix $[A - \\lambda I \\ \\ B]$ has full row rank ($n=2$) for all eigenvalues $\\lambda$ of $A$ such that $|\\lambda| \\ge 1$.\n\nWe only need to check this for the unstable eigenvalue $\\lambda = 1.1$:\n$$\n[A - 1.1I \\ \\ B] = \\left[ \\begin{array}{cc|c} 0 & 0 & 1 \\\\ 0 & -0.6 & 0 \\end{array} \\right]\n$$\nThe rank of this $2 \\times 3$ matrix is $2$, which is the dimension of the state space. Thus, the PHB condition is satisfied. The pair $(A,B)$ is stabilizable. A stabilizing state-feedback gain $K$ such that $A-BK$ is stable exists.\n\n**2. Analysis of Detectability for the pair $(A,C)$**\n\nA system is detectable if all its unstable modes are observable. We again use the PHB test. The pair $(A,C)$ is detectable if and only if the matrix $\\begin{bmatrix} A - \\lambda I \\\\ C \\end{bmatrix}$ has full column rank ($n=2$) for all eigenvalues $\\lambda$ of $A$ such that $|\\lambda| \\ge 1$.\n\nWe check this for the unstable eigenvalue $\\lambda = 1.1$:\n$$\n\\begin{bmatrix} A - 1.1I \\\\ C \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} 1.1 - 1.1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0.5 - 1.1 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\\\ 0 & 0 \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -0.6 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\\\ 0 & 0 \\end{bmatrix}\n$$\nThe first column of this $4 \\times 2$ matrix is a zero vector. The second column is non-zero. Therefore, the rank of this matrix is $1$. Since the rank ($1$) is less than the state dimension ($n=2$), the PHB condition fails. The pair $(A,C)$ is not detectable.\n\nThe physical meaning is clear from the system matrices. The state is $x_k = [x_{1,k}, x_{2,k}]^\\top$. The dynamics are decoupled: $x_{1,k+1} = 1.1 x_{1,k} + u_k + w_{1,k}$ and $x_{2,k+1} = 0.5 x_{2,k} + w_{2,k}$. The output is $y_k = C x_k + v_k$, which gives $y_k = \\begin{bmatrix} x_{2,k} \\\\ 0 \\end{bmatrix} + v_k$. The first state variable, $x_{1,k}$, which corresponds to the unstable mode, never influences the output $y_k$. Therefore, the unstable mode is unobservable.\n\n**3. Conclusion on the Separation Principle and Kalman Filter**\n\nThe existence of a stabilizing steady-state Kalman filter requires that the pair $(A,C)$ be detectable. This condition ensures that an observer gain $L$ exists such that the error dynamics matrix $(A-LC)$ is stable. Since we have proven that $(A,C)$ is not detectable, no such stabilizing gain $L$ exists. Any estimate of the state $x_{1,k}$ will have an error that grows according to the unstable dynamic $1.1$, regardless of the measurements.\n\nThe separation principle for designing a stabilizing output-feedback controller requires both stabilizability of $(A,B)$ and detectability of $(A,C)$. While the system is stabilizable, it is not detectable. Therefore, a controller designed based on the separation principle (i.e., combining a state-feedback controller with a state estimator) will not be able to stabilize the overall closed-loop system. The unstable estimation error will \"pollute\" the control input and destabilize the plant.\n\nNow, we evaluate each option.\n\n**Option-by-Option Analysis**\n\nA. The pair $(A,B)$ is stabilizable, but $(A,C)$ is not detectable because the unstable mode associated with $x_1$ is unobservable; consequently, no stabilizing Kalman filter exists and separation-based output-feedback stabilization fails.\n- Our analysis shows that $(A,B)$ is stabilizable. This part is correct.\n- Our analysis shows that $(A,C)$ is not detectable because the unstable mode (eigenvalue $1.1$, associated with state $x_1$) is unobservable. This part is correct.\n- The consequence of non-detectability is that no observer gain can stabilize the estimation error dynamics, meaning no stabilizing Kalman filter exists. This is correct.\n- The failure to meet the detectability condition means separation-based design cannot produce a stable closed-loop system. This is correct.\nTherefore, this statement is entirely correct.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\nB. Although $C$ does not directly measure the unstable mode, the process noise $w_k$ excites all states, so the Kalman filter can still stabilize the estimation error via noise-driven inference; therefore, separation still yields a stabilizing output-feedback controller.\n- The premise that process noise excites all states is true because $W=I$ is full rank. However, the conclusion is false. For information to be useful for estimation, it must travel from the state to the measurement output. Here, the state $x_1$ is structurally disconnected from the output $y$. No amount of noise or correlation can create an information pathway that does not exist in the fundamental structure described by $(A,C)$. The condition for stabilizing the estimator is detectability of $(A,C)$, which is a structural property independent of noise statistics $W$ and $V$.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\nC. The singularity of $V$ alone invalidates the Kalman filter for all systems, so the separation principle cannot hold in any case when $V$ is singular.\n- This is a false generalization. A singular measurement noise covariance matrix $V$ indicates the presence of one or more noise-free measurements. In our case, $V = \\text{diag}(0, 1)$ means the first component of the output, $y_{1,k}$, is measured perfectly. The theory of Kalman filtering is well-equipped to handle this scenario; it leads to a \"perfect update\" where the estimate is forced to satisfy the noise-free measurement equation. Far from invalidating the filter, it provides perfect information about a part of the state (or a linear combination of states). The problem here is not the singularity of $V$, but the non-detectability of $(A,C)$.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\nD. The zero row in $C$ provides a noise-only sensor that effectively regularizes the estimation problem when paired with singular $V$, improving detectability; hence a stabilizing Kalman filter exists despite the lack of direct measurement of the unstable mode.\n- The second row of $C$ is zero, leading to an output component $y_{2,k} = v_{2,k}$, which is indeed a noise-only sensor. However, a measurement of pure noise provides zero information about the state. It cannot \"regularize\" the problem or \"improve detectability\". Detectability is a property of the pair $(A,C)$ and is not improved or affected by noise statistics or the presence of useless sensors. The conclusion that a stabilizing filter exists is diametrically opposed to our rigorous finding based on the PHB test.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2753854"}]}
