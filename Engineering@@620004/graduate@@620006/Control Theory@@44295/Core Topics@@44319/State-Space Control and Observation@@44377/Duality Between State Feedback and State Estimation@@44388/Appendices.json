Assume the pair $(A,B)$ is controllable and the pair $(A,C)$ is observable. In the state-feedback control problem with $u = -K x$, a standard design method for $K$ in the single-input case is to choose $K$ such that the characteristic polynomial of $A - B K$ matches a desired monic polynomial by coefficient matching, guaranteeing closed-loop stability and transient performance according to the chosen polynomial.\n\nTask:\n1.

It is complete, consistent, and requires the application of the duality principle, a standard and verifiable concept. Therefore, the problem is valid and I will proceed with its solution.\n\nThe solution is divided into two parts as requested. First, the theoretical construction of the dual estimation method is presented. Second, this method is applied to the given system, and the results are verified.\n\n**1. Dual Construction of the Observer Gain**\n\nThe problem of state-feedback control for a linear time-invariant system $\\dot{x} = A x + B u$ involves finding a state-feedback gain matrix $K$ such that the control law $u = -K x$ places the eigenvalues of the closed-loop system matrix, $A - B K$, at desired locations in the complex plane. The characteristic polynomial of the closed-loop system is given by $\\det(sI - (A - B K))$. This pole placement is possible if and only if the pair $(A, B)$ is controllable.\n\nThe problem of state estimation, or observer design, is to construct an estimate $\\hat{x}$ of the state $x$ using the system's output $y$. The Luenberger observer is described by the dynamics $\\dot{\\hat{x}} = A \\hat{x} + B u + L(y - C \\hat{x})$, where $L$ is the observer gain matrix. The state estimation error is defined as $e = x - \\hat{x}$. The dynamics of this error are found by subtracting the observer dynamics from the system dynamics:\n$$ \\dot{e} = \\dot{x} - \\dot{\\hat{x}} = (A x + B u) - (A \\hat{x} + B u + L(C x - C \\hat{x})) = A(x - \\hat{x}) - L C (x - \\hat{x}) = (A - L C)e $$\nThe goal of observer design is to choose $L$ such that the error $e(t)$ converges to zero. This is achieved by placing the eigenvalues of the error dynamics matrix, $A - L C$, at desired stable locations. The characteristic polynomial of the error dynamics is $\\det(sI - (A - L C))$. This pole placement is possible if and only if the pair $(A, C)$ is observable.\n\nThe principle of duality in control theory connects the state-feedback problem with the observer design problem. The eigenvalues of a matrix are identical to the eigenvalues of its transpose. Therefore, the eigenvalues of $A - L C$ are the same as the eigenvalues of its transpose, $(A - L C)^T = A^T - C^T L^T$.\n\nNow, consider a \"dual\" system described by the state-space pair $(A_{dual}, B_{dual}) = (A^T, C^T)$. For this dual system, the state-feedback pole placement problem is to find a gain $K_{dual}$ such that the eigenvalues of the dual closed-loop matrix, $A_{dual} - B_{dual} K_{dual} = A^T - C^T K_{dual}$, are at desired locations.\n\nBy comparing the matrix for the observer error characteristic equation, $A^T - C^T L^T$, with the matrix for the dual control problem, $A^T - C^T K_{dual}$, we establish a direct correspondence. If we set the observer gain $L$ such that $L^T = K_{dual}$, then the observer poles (eigenvalues of $A - L C$) will be identical to the closed-loop poles of the dual system (eigenvalues of $A^T - C^T K_{dual}$).\n\nThus, the dual estimation method is as follows:\nTo find the observer gain $L$ that places the eigenvalues of $(A - L C)$ at a set of desired locations $\\{p_1, \\dots, p_n\\}$, one solves the equivalent state-feedback pole placement problem for the dual system $(A^T, C^T)$. That is, find the feedback gain $K_{dual}$ that places the eigenvalues of $(A^T - C^T K_{dual})$ at the same locations $\\{p_1, \\dots, p_n\\}$. The required observer gain is then given by $L = K_{dual}^T$.\n\nThe condition for the existence of such a $K_{dual}$ is that the pair $(A^T, C^T)$ must be controllable. A fundamental theorem of linear systems states that $(A, C)$ is observable if and only if $(A^T, C^T)$ is controllable. This confirms the consistency of the duality principle.\n\n**2. Application and Verification**\n\nWe are given the system with matrices:\n$$ A = \\begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ -2 & -3 \\end{bmatrix}, \\quad B = \\begin{bmatrix} 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{bmatrix}, \\quad C = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\end{bmatrix} $$\n\nFirst, as a preliminary step, we design the state-feedback controller gain $K = \\begin{bmatrix} k_1 & k_2 \\end{bmatrix}$ to place the poles at $s = -2$ and $s = -5$. The desired characteristic polynomial is $p_c(s) = (s+2)(s+5) = s^2 + 7s + 10$.\nThe closed-loop matrix is $A - BK$:\n$$ A - BK = \\begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ -2 & -3 \\end{bmatrix} - \\begin{bmatrix} 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{bmatrix} \\begin{bmatrix} k_1 & k_2 \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ -2 - k_1 & -3 - k_2 \\end{bmatrix} $$\nThe characteristic polynomial is $\\det(sI - (A-BK)) = s(s+3+k_2) - (-(2+k_1)) = s^2 + (3+k_2)s + (2+k_1)$.\nMatching coefficients with $s^2 + 7s + 10$:\n$3+k_2 = 7 \\implies k_2 = 4$.\n$2+k_1 = 10 \\implies k_1 = 8$.\nSo, the controller gain is $K = \\begin{bmatrix} 8 & 4 \\end{bmatrix}$.\n\nNext, we design the observer gain $L$ using the dual method. The desired observer error poles are at $s = -6$ and $s = -7$. The desired observer characteristic polynomial is $p_o(s) = (s+6)(s+7) = s^2 + 13s + 42$.\nWe construct the dual system $(A^T, C^T)$:\n$$ A^T = \\begin{bmatrix} 0 & -2 \\\\ 1 & -3 \\end{bmatrix}, \\quad C^T = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{bmatrix} $$\nWe seek a dual feedback gain $K_{dual} = \\begin{bmatrix} k_{d1} & k_{d2} \\end{bmatrix}$ to place the poles of the dual system at $s = -6$ and $s = -7$.\nThe dual closed-loop matrix is $A^T - C^T K_{dual}$:\n$$ A^T - C^T K_{dual} = \\begin{bmatrix} 0 & -2 \\\\ 1 & -3 \\end{bmatrix} - \\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{bmatrix} \\begin{bmatrix} k_{d1} & k_{d2} \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} -k_{d1} & -2-k_{d2} \\\\ 1 & -3 \\end{bmatrix} $$\nIts characteristic polynomial is $\\det(sI - (A^T-C^T K_{dual})) = (s+k_{d1})(s+3) - (-(2+k_{d2})) = s^2 + (3+k_{d1})s + (3k_{d1} + 2 + k_{d2})$.\nMatching coefficients with $p_o(s) = s^2 + 13s + 42$:\n$s^1$: $3+k_{d1} = 13 \\implies k_{d1} = 10$.\n$s^0$: $3k_{d1} + 2 + k_{d2} = 42 \\implies 3(10) + 2 + k_{d2} = 42 \\implies 32 + k_{d2} = 42 \\implies k_{d2} = 10$.\nThe dual gain is $K_{dual} = \\begin{bmatrix} 10 & 10 \\end{bmatrix}$.\nThe observer gain is $L = K_{dual}^T = \\begin{bmatrix} 10 \\\\ 10 \\end{bmatrix}$.\n\n**Verification:**\nWe verify that this gain $L$ places the observer poles correctly. The error dynamics matrix is $A-LC$:\n$$ A - LC = \\begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ -2 & -3 \\end{bmatrix} - \\begin{bmatrix} 10 \\\\ 10 \\end{bmatrix} \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ -2 & -3 \\end{bmatrix} - \\begin{bmatrix} 10 & 0 \\\\ 10 & 0 \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} -10 & 1 \\\\ -12 & -3 \\end{bmatrix} $$\nThe characteristic polynomial is $\\det(sI - (A-LC)) = \\det \\begin{bmatrix} s+10 & -1 \\\\ 12 & s+3 \\end{bmatrix} = (s+10)(s+3) - (-12) = s^2 + 13s + 30 + 12 = s^2 + 13s + 42$.\nThis polynomial has roots at $s = -6$ and $s = -7$, which are the desired observer poles. The verification is successful.\n\nFinally, we verify the separation principle for the combined system with state-feedback from the estimated state, $u = -K\\hat{x}$. The state equations for the augmented system comprising the plant state $x$ and the estimation error $e$ are:\n$$ \\dot{x} = A x + B u = A x - B K \\hat{x} = A x - B K(x - e) = (A - B K)x + B K e $$\n$$ \\dot{e} = (A - L C)e $$\nIn matrix form:\n$$ \\frac{d}{dt} \\begin{bmatrix} x \\\\ e \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} A-BK & BK \\\\ 0 & A-LC \\end{bmatrix} \\begin{bmatrix} x \\\\ e \\end{bmatrix} $$\nThe system matrix is block upper-triangular. Therefore, its set of eigenvalues is the union of the eigenvalues of the diagonal blocks, $A - BK$ and $A - LC$. The eigenvalues of $A-BK$ are the controller poles $\\{-2, -5\\}$, and the eigenvalues of $A-LC$ are the observer poles $\\{-6, -7\\}$. The eigenvalues of the complete output-feedback system are indeed $\\{-2, -5, -6, -7\\}$. This confirms the separation structure.\n\nThe required final answer is the estimator gain $L$ expressed as a row vector.\nWe found $L = \\begin{bmatrix} 10 \\\\ 10 \\end{bmatrix}$. The corresponding row vector is $\\begin{pmatrix} 10 & 10 \\end{pmatrix}$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n10 & 10\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "2693646"}, {"introduction": "To fully grasp the power and limitations of state feedback and estimation, we must look at the system's underlying structure.

It is a standard academic question in control theory. I will proceed with the derivation and solution.\n\n### Derivation\n\nThe analysis is divided into two parts: state feedback and observer design.\n\n**Part 1: State Feedback and Controllability**\n\nThe state feedback law is $u = K \\bar{x}$. We partition the gain matrix $K$ conformably with the state $\\bar{x}$ as $K = \\begin{bmatrix} K_{1} & K_{2} & K_{3} & K_{4} \\end{bmatrix}$. The closed-loop system dynamics are described by $\\dot{\\bar{x}} = (\\bar{A} + \\bar{B} K) \\bar{x}$. The closed-loop system matrix $\\bar{A}_{cl}$ is:\n$$\n\\bar{A}_{cl} = \\bar{A} + \\bar{B} K = \\begin{bmatrix}\nA_{11} & A_{12} & A_{13} & A_{14} \\\\\n0 & A_{22} & 0 & A_{24} \\\\\n0 & 0 & A_{33} & A_{34} \\\\\n0 & 0 & 0 & A_{44}\n\\end{bmatrix} + \\begin{bmatrix}\nB_{1} \\\\ B_{2} \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0\n\\end{bmatrix} \\begin{bmatrix} K_{1} & K_{2} & K_{3} & K_{4} \\end{bmatrix}\n$$\n$$\n\\bar{A}_{cl} = \\begin{bmatrix}\nA_{11} + B_{1}K_{1} & A_{12} + B_{1}K_{2} & A_{13} + B_{1}K_{3} & A_{14} + B_{1}K_{4} \\\\\nB_{2}K_{1} & A_{22} + B_{2}K_{2} & B_{2}K_{3} & A_{24} + B_{2}K_{4} \\\\\n0 & 0 & A_{33} & A_{34} \\\\\n0 & 0 & 0 & A_{44}\n\\end{bmatrix}\n$$\nThe closed-loop matrix $\\bar{A}_{cl}$ is block upper-triangular when partitioned between the controllable part $(\\bar{x}_{c} = \\begin{bmatrix} x_{1}^{\\top} & x_{2}^{\\top} \\end{bmatrix}^{\\top})$ and the uncontrollable part $(\\bar{x}_{uc} = \\begin{bmatrix} x_{3}^{\\top} & x_{4}^{\\top} \\end{bmatrix}^{\\top})$. Specifically, the matrix has the structure:\n$$\n\\bar{A}_{cl} = \\begin{bmatrix} \\bar{A}_{c,cl} & \\bar{A}_{12,cl} \\\\ 0 & \\bar{A}_{uc} \\end{bmatrix}\n$$\nwhere $\\bar{A}_{uc} = \\begin{bmatrix} A_{33} & A_{34} \\\\ 0 & A_{44} \\end{bmatrix}$ represents the dynamics of the uncontrollable subspace. The eigenvalues of $\\bar{A}_{cl}$ are the union of the eigenvalues of $\\bar{A}_{c,cl}$ and $\\bar{A}_{uc}$. The eigenvalues of $\\bar{A}_{uc}$ are the eigenvalues of $A_{33}$ and $A_{44}$, which are unaffected by the feedback gain $K$. These are the uncontrollable modes of the system.\n\nThe block $\\bar{A}_{c,cl}$ corresponds to the dynamics of the controllable subspace:\n$$\n\\bar{A}_{c,cl} = \\begin{bmatrix} A_{11} + B_{1}K_{1} & A_{12} + B_{1}K_{2} \\\\ B_{2}K_{1} & A_{22} + B_{2}K_{2} \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} A_{11} & A_{12} \\\\ 0 & A_{22} \\end{bmatrix} + \\begin{bmatrix} B_{1} \\\\ B_{2} \\end{bmatrix} \\begin{bmatrix} K_{1} & K_{2} \\end{bmatrix}\n$$\nAccording to the Kalman decomposition, the controllable subspace corresponds to the states $(x_{1}, x_{2})$. This implies that the pair $(\\begin{bmatrix} A_{11} & A_{12} \\\\ 0 & A_{22} \\end{bmatrix}, \\begin{bmatrix} B_{1} \\\\ B_{2} \\end{bmatrix})$ is controllable. By the pole placement theorem, since this pair is controllable, we can arbitrarily assign the eigenvalues of the closed-loop matrix $\\bar{A}_{c,cl}$ by a suitable choice of the feedback gain $\\begin{bmatrix} K_{1} & K_{2} \\end{bmatrix}$.\n\nConclusion for state feedback: The eigenvalues associated with the controllable subspace (states $x_{1}$ and $x_{2}$), which are the eigenvalues of the blocks $A_{11}$ and $A_{22}$ in the open-loop system, can be arbitrarily assigned. The eigenvalues associated with the uncontrollable subspace (states $x_{3}$ and $x_{4}$), corresponding to blocks $A_{33}$ and $A_{44}$, cannot be changed.\n\n**Part 2: Observer Design and Observability**\n\nAn observer estimates the state $\\bar{x}$. Let the estimation error be $e = \\bar{x} - \\hat{\\bar{x}}$. The dynamics of the error are given by:\n$$\n\\dot{e} = \\dot{\\bar{x}} - \\dot{\\hat{\\bar{x}}} = (\\bar{A}\\bar{x} + \\bar{B}u) - (\\bar{A}\\hat{\\bar{x}} + \\bar{B}u + \\bar{L}(\\bar{y} - \\bar{C}\\hat{\\bar{x}}))\n$$\nSubstituting $\\bar{y} = \\bar{C}\\bar{x}$, we get:\n$$\n\\dot{e} = \\bar{A}(\\bar{x} - \\hat{\\bar{x}}) - \\bar{L}\\bar{C}(\\bar{x} - \\hat{\\bar{x}}) = (\\bar{A} - \\bar{L}\\bar{C})e\n$$\nThe problem of designing an observer to make the error $e$ converge to zero asymptotically is equivalent to placing the eigenvalues of the error dynamics matrix $\\bar{A}_{err} = \\bar{A} - \\bar{L}\\bar{C}$ in the open left-half of the complex plane. The ability to arbitrarily place these eigenvalues depends on the observability of the pair $(\\bar{A}, \\bar{C})$.\n\nBy the principle of duality, the observability of $(\\bar{A}, \\bar{C})$ is equivalent to the controllability of the dual pair $(\\bar{A}^{\\top}, \\bar{C}^{\\top})$. Let us examine this dual pair.\n$$\n\\bar{A}^{\\top} = \\begin{bmatrix}\nA_{11}^{\\top} & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\\nA_{12}^{\\top} & A_{22}^{\\top} & 0 & 0 \\\\\nA_{13}^{\\top} & 0 & A_{33}^{\\top} & 0 \\\\\nA_{14}^{\\top} & A_{24}^{\\top} & A_{34}^{\\top} & A_{44}^{\\top}\n\\end{bmatrix}, \\quad\n\\bar{C}^{\\top} = \\begin{bmatrix}\nC_{1}^{\\top} \\\\ 0 \\\\ C_{3}^{\\top} \\\\ 0\n\\end{bmatrix}\n$$\nThe states of the dual system that can be reached from the input correspond to the controllable subspace of $(\\bar{A}^{\\top}, \\bar{C}^{\\top})$. Due to the structure of $\\bar{C}^{\\top}$, the input only affects the first and third blocks of the state. The dynamics of these states are governed by the sub-matrix $\\begin{bmatrix} A_{11}^{\\top} & 0 \\\\ A_{13}^{\\top} & A_{33}^{\\top} \\end{bmatrix}$. The pair $(\\begin{bmatrix} A_{11}^{\\top} & 0 \\\\ A_{13}^{\\top} & A_{33}^{\\top} \\end{bmatrix}, \\begin{bmatrix} C_{1}^{\\top} \\\\ C_{3}^{\\top} \\end{bmatrix})$ is controllable, which by duality means the pair $(\\begin{bmatrix} A_{11} & A_{13} \\\\ 0 & A_{33} \\end{bmatrix}, \\begin{bmatrix} C_{1} & C_{3} \\end{bmatrix})$ is observable. This corresponds to the observable subspace of the original system, spanned by states $x_{1}$ and $x_{3}$.\n\nTherefore, we can arbitrarily assign the eigenvalues of the observable part of the error dynamics by choosing the observer gain $\\bar{L}$. These are the eigenvalues associated with the states $e_{1}$ and $e_{3}$. The eigenvalues associated with the unobservable error components, $e_{2}$ and $e_{4}$, cannot be changed by $\\bar{L}$. Their dynamics are governed by the eigenvalues of $A_{22}$ and $A_{44}$. Consequently, an observer can be designed to make the error components $e_{1}$ and $e_{3}$ converge to zero at any desired rate, meaning states $x_{1}$ and $x_{3}$ can be asymptotically reconstructed. The states $x_{2}$ and $x_{4}$ cannot be reconstructed unless the subsystems governed by $A_{22}$ and $A_{44}$ are naturally stable.\n\nConclusion for observer design: The observer error eigenvalues corresponding to the observable subspace (states $x_{1}$ and $x_{3}$) can be arbitrarily assigned by choice of $\\bar{L}$. This allows for asymptotic reconstruction of state components $x_{1}$ and $x_{3}$. The error dynamics for $x_{2}$ and $x_{4}$ are fixed, so these states cannot generally be reconstructed.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. Only the eigenvalues of $A_{11}$ can be arbitrarily assigned by state feedback; the eigenvalues of $A_{22}$, $A_{33}$, and $A_{44}$ are unaffected. An observer can asymptotically reconstruct only $x_{1}$; the components $x_{2}$, $x_{3}$, $x_{4}$ cannot be reconstructed.**\n- *State Feedback*: Incorrect. The entire controllable subspace dynamics, associated with both $A_{11}$ and $A_{22}$, can be modified.\n- *Observer*: Incorrect. The entire observable subspace, including both $x_{1}$ and $x_{3}$, can be reconstructed.\n- **Verdict**: Incorrect.\n\n**B. The eigenvalues associated with the controllable subspace, that is those of $A_{11}$ and $A_{22}$, can be arbitrarily assigned by state feedback (while the eigenvalues of $A_{33}$ and $A_{44}$ remain unchanged). Independently, the estimator error eigenvalues on the observable subspace, that is those associated with $A_{11}$ and $A_{33}$, can be arbitrarily assigned by the observer gain, and the observer can asymptotically reconstruct $x_{1}$ and $x_{3}$ but not $x_{2}$ or $x_{4}$.**\n- *State Feedback*: Correct. As derived, the eigenvalues of the controllable part (associated with dynamics of $x_{1}$ and $x_{2}$) are assignable, while those of the uncontrollable part (associated with $x_{3}$ and $x_{4}$) are not.\n- *Observer*: Correct. As derived, the error dynamics eigenvalues for the observable part (associated with $x_{1}$ and $x_{3}$) are assignable, allowing reconstruction of these states. The unobservable states $x_{2}$ and $x_{4}$ cannot be reconstructed by choice of observer gain.\n- **Verdict**: Correct.\n\n**C. Because of the off-diagonal couplings $A_{13}$, $A_{14}$, $A_{24}$, state feedback can indirectly move all eigenvalues of $\\bar{A}$, including those of $A_{33}$ and $A_{44}$. Similarly, an observer can reconstruct all components $x_{1}$, $x_{2}$, $x_{3}$, $x_{4}$.**\n- *State Feedback*: Incorrect. The block upper-triangular structure of the closed-loop matrix $\\bar{A}_{cl}$ shows that the eigenvalues of the uncontrollable subsystem (associated with $A_{33}$ and $A_{44}$) are invariant. The coupling terms flow from uncontrollable to controllable states, not the other way around.\n- *Observer*: Incorrect. The unobservable states ($x_{2}$, $x_{4}$) cannot be reconstructed.\n- **Verdict**: Incorrect.\n\n**D. State feedback cannot change any diagonal block eigenvalues but can only alter off-diagonal couplings such as $A_{12}$, $A_{13}$, and $A_{24}$. The observer gain cannot change any estimator error eigenvalues because $\\bar{C}$ has structural zeros.**\n- *State Feedback*: Incorrect. Pole placement fundamentally changes the eigenvalues (poles) of the controllable part of the system.\n- *Observer*: Incorrect. The observer gain can indeed change the eigenvalues of the observable part of the error dynamics. The structural zeros in $\\bar{C}$ are what *define* the unobservable subspace, not what makes observer design impossible for the whole system.\n- **Verdict**: Incorrect.\n\n**E. State feedback can arbitrarily assign the eigenvalues of $A_{11}$, $A_{22}$, and $A_{33}$, but not $A_{44}$. The observer can asymptotically reconstruct only $x_{1}$, not $x_{3}$, because $x_{3}$ is uncontrollable.**\n- *State Feedback*: Incorrect. The eigenvalues associated with $A_{33}$ (uncontrollable subspace) cannot be assigned.\n- *Observer*: Incorrect. Reconstruction depends on observability, not controllability. The state $x_{3}$ is defined as observable and is therefore reconstructible.\n- **Verdict**: Incorrect.\n\nThe only statement that accurately describes the consequences of the Kalman decomposition for both state feedback and observer design is B.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2715529"}, {"introduction": "Observer design is not a one-size-fits-all task; the 'best' approach depends on the design goals and the nature of the system.

Provide the exact values; do not round.", "solution": "The problem is subjected to validation and found to be well-posed, scientifically sound, and internally consistent. It is a standard problem in linear systems theory and optimal estimation. We shall proceed with the solution.\n\nPart 1: Derivation of Observer Pole Placement\nThe objective is to demonstrate that for an observable pair $(A,C)$, where $A \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n \\times n}$ and $C \\in \\mathbb{R}^{m \\times n}$, it is always possible to find an output injection gain $L \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n \\times m}$ such that the characteristic polynomial of the observer error dynamics matrix, $A-LC$, matches any specified monic polynomial $p(\\lambda)$ of degree $n$. This property is known as pole placement or pole assignment for observers. The derivation will rely on the principle of duality in control theory.\n\nThe poles of the observer are the eigenvalues of the matrix $A-LC$. The characteristic polynomial of $A-LC$ is given by $\\det(\\lambda I - (A-LC))$. A fundamental property of determinants is that $\\det(M) = \\det(M^{\\top})$ for any square matrix $M$. Therefore, the eigenvalues of $A-LC$ are identical to the eigenvalues of its transpose, $(A-LC)^{\\top} = A^{\\top} - C^{\\top}L^{\\top}$.\n\nLet us define a \"dual\" system. For the primal system governed by matrices $(A, C)$, we define a dual system with state matrix $A' = A^{\\top}$ and input matrix $B' = C^{\\top}$. We also define a state feedback gain for this dual system as $K' = L^{\\top}$. The closed-loop matrix for this dual system under state feedback is $A' - B'K' = A^{\\top} - C^{\\top}L^{\\top}$.\n\nFrom this construction, it is evident that the problem of finding an observer gain $L$ to place the eigenvalues of $A-LC$ at desired locations is mathematically equivalent to the problem of finding a state-feedback gain $K' = L^{\\top}$ to place the eigenvalues of $A^{\\top} - C^{\\top}L^{\\top}$ at the same locations. The latter is the standard state-feedback pole placement problem for the system $(A', B') = (A^{\\top}, C^{\\top})$.\n\nA cornerstone theorem of control theory states that arbitrary pole placement via state feedback is possible if and only if the system is controllable. Therefore, if we can prove that the dual system $(A^{\\top}, C^{\\top})$ is controllable, then we can always find a gain $K'$ (and thus an $L$) to achieve any desired characteristic polynomial. The linkage between the observability of the primal system and the controllability of the dual system is established using the Popov–Belevitch–Hautus (PBH) test.\n\nThe PBH test for observability states that the pair $(A, C)$ is observable if and only if the matrix\n$$\n\\begin{pmatrix} A - \\lambda I \\\\ C \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nhas full column rank $n$ for all complex numbers $\\lambda \\in \\mathbb{C}$.\n\nThe problem statement posits that the pair $(A,C)$ is observable. Thus, for any $\\lambda \\in \\mathbb{C}$,\n$$\n\\mathrm{rank} \\begin{pmatrix} A - \\lambda I \\\\ C \\end{pmatrix} = n.\n$$\nSince the rank of a matrix is equal to the rank of its transpose, we have\n$$\n\\mathrm{rank} \\left( \\begin{pmatrix} A - \\lambda I \\\\ C \\end{pmatrix}^{\\top} \\right) = \\mathrm{rank} \\begin{pmatrix} (A - \\lambda I)^{\\top} & C^{\\top} \\end{pmatrix} = \\mathrm{rank} \\begin{pmatrix} A^{\\top} - \\lambda I & C^{\\top} \\end{pmatrix} = n.\n$$\nThis last condition, $\\mathrm{rank} \\begin{pmatrix} A^{\\top} - \\lambda I & C^{\\top} \\end{pmatrix} = n$ for all $\\lambda \\in \\mathbb{C}$, is precisely the PBH test for controllability of the pair $(A^{\\top}, C^{\\top})$.\n\nTherefore, if the pair $(A,C)$ is observable, the pair $(A^{\\top}, C^{\\top})$ is controllable. By the state-feedback pole placement theorem, for a controllable system, a gain matrix $K'$ can be found to assign the eigenvalues of the closed-loop system $A^{\\top}-C^{\\top}K'$ to any desired set of locations. These locations are the roots of the specified monic polynomial $p(\\lambda)$. By setting $K'=L^{\\top}$, we find the observer gain $L$ that places the poles of the observer dynamics matrix $A-LC$ at these same locations. The requirement that the roots of $p(\\lambda)$ lie in the open left half-plane ensures the stability of the observer, which is the practical objective. This completes the derivation.\n\nPart 2: Computation of Eigenvalue Placement Gain\nWe are given the system with matrices\n$$\nA = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}, \\quad C = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}.\n$$\nThe output injection gain is $L = \\begin{pmatrix} \\ell_{1} \\\\ \\ell_{2} \\end{pmatrix}$. The matrix $A-LC$ is computed as:\n$$\nA - LC = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} - \\begin{pmatrix} \\ell_{1} \\\\ \\ell_{2} \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} - \\begin{pmatrix} \\ell_{1} & 0 \\\\ \\ell_{2} & 0 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} -\\ell_{1} & 1 \\\\ -\\ell_{2} & 0 \\end{pmatrix}.\n$$\nThe characteristic polynomial of $A-LC$ is\n$$\n\\det(\\lambda I - (A-LC)) = \\det \\begin{pmatrix} \\lambda + \\ell_{1} & -1 \\\\ \\ell_{2} & \\lambda \\end{pmatrix} = \\lambda(\\lambda + \\ell_{1}) - (-1)(\\ell_{2}) = \\lambda^{2} + \\ell_{1}\\lambda + \\ell_{2}.\n$$\nThe desired eigenvalues are $\\lambda_{1} = -2$ and $\\lambda_{2} = -5$. The desired characteristic polynomial is\n$$\np(\\lambda) = (\\lambda - \\lambda_{1})(\\lambda - \\lambda_{2}) = (\\lambda + 2)(\\lambda + 5) = \\lambda^{2} + 7\\lambda + 10.\n$$\nBy matching the coefficients of the computed and desired characteristic polynomials, we obtain:\n$$\n\\ell_{1} = 7, \\quad \\ell_{2} = 10.\n$$\nThus, the required gain matrix is $L = \\begin{pmatrix} 7 \\\\ 10 \\end{pmatrix}$.\n\nPart 3: Computation of Steady-State Kalman Gain and Conceptual Contrast\nWe are given process and measurement noise with covariance intensities $Q=I$ and $R=1$. The steady-state Kalman filter gain $L_{\\mathrm{KF}}$ is given by $L_{\\mathrm{KF}} = PC^{\\top}R^{-1}$, where $P$ is the symmetric, positive-definite solution to the continuous-time algebraic Riccati equation (CARE):\n$$\nAP + PA^{\\top} - PC^{\\top}R^{-1}CP + Q = 0.\n$$\nLet $P = \\begin{pmatrix} p_{11} & p_{12} \\\\ p_{12} & p_{22} \\end{pmatrix}$. Substituting the given matrices $A, C, Q, R$:\n$$\n\\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} p_{11} & p_{12} \\\\ p_{12} & p_{22} \\end{pmatrix} + \\begin{pmatrix} p_{11} & p_{12} \\\\ p_{12} & p_{22} \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} - \\begin{pmatrix} p_{11} & p_{12} \\\\ p_{12} & p_{22} \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix} (1) \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} p_{11} & p_{12} \\\\ p_{12} & p_{22} \\end{pmatrix} + \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}.\n$$\nEvaluating each term:\n$$\n\\begin{pmatrix} p_{12} & p_{22} \\\\ 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} + \\begin{pmatrix} p_{12} & 0 \\\\ p_{22} & 0 \\end{pmatrix} - \\begin{pmatrix} p_{11} \\\\ p_{12} \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} p_{11} & p_{12} \\end{pmatrix} + \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\n$$\n\\begin{pmatrix} 2p_{12} & p_{22} \\\\ p_{22} & 0 \\end{pmatrix} - \\begin{pmatrix} p_{11}^{2} & p_{11}p_{12} \\\\ p_{11}p_{12} & p_{12}^{2} \\end{pmatrix} + \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}.\n$$\nThis matrix equation yields a system of algebraic equations for the entries of $P$:\n1. $2p_{12} - p_{11}^{2} + 1 = 0$\n2. $p_{22} - p_{11}p_{12} = 0$\n3. $-p_{12}^{2} + 1 = 0$\n\nFrom equation ($3$), we find $p_{12}^{2} = 1$, which gives $p_{12} = \\pm 1$. The eigenvalues of the Kalman filter error dynamics matrix $A - L_{\\mathrm{KF}}C = \\begin{pmatrix} -p_{11} & 1 \\\\ -p_{12} & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$ must lie in the open left half-plane for stability. The characteristic polynomial is $\\lambda^{2} + p_{11}\\lambda + p_{12} = 0$. For stable roots, the Routh-Hurwitz stability criterion requires all coefficients to be positive. Thus, we must have $p_{11} > 0$ and $p_{12} > 0$. We must therefore select $p_{12} = 1$.\n\nSubstituting $p_{12}=1$ into equation ($1$):\n$$\n2(1) - p_{11}^{2} + 1 = 0 \\implies p_{11}^{2} = 3.\n$$\nSince we require $p_{11} > 0$, we have $p_{11} = \\sqrt{3}$.\n\nSubstituting $p_{11}=\\sqrt{3}$ and $p_{12}=1$ into equation ($2$):\n$$\np_{22} - (\\sqrt{3})(1) = 0 \\implies p_{22} = \\sqrt{3}.\n$$\nThe steady-state error covariance is $P = \\begin{pmatrix} \\sqrt{3} & 1 \\\\ 1 & \\sqrt{3} \\end{pmatrix}$. We verify that this matrix is positive definite: $p_{11}=\\sqrt{3} > 0$ and $\\det(P) = (\\sqrt{3})(\\sqrt{3}) - 1^{2} = 3-1=2>0$.\n\nThe steady-state Kalman gain $L_{\\mathrm{KF}}$ is then:\n$$\nL_{\\mathrm{KF}} = PC^{\\top}R^{-1} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\sqrt{3} & 1 \\\\ 1 & \\sqrt{3} \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix} (1) = \\begin{pmatrix} \\sqrt{3} \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}.\n$$\nLetting $L_{\\mathrm{KF}} = \\begin{pmatrix} k_{1} \\\\ k_{2} \\end{pmatrix}$, we have $k_{1} = \\sqrt{3}$ and $k_{2} = 1$.\n\nConceptual Contrast:\nThe eigenvalue placement gain $L$ from Part $2$ is chosen deterministically to achieve an arbitrary, user-specified dynamic response for the observer error. The choice of poles (here, $-2$ and $-5$) is dictated by design specifications like desired settling time or damping, but is otherwise arbitrary. This method completely ignores any stochastic aspects of the system, such as process or measurement noise.\n\nIn stark contrast, the steady-state Kalman gain $L_{\\mathrm{KF}}$ from Part $3$ is not arbitrary. It is uniquely determined as the optimal gain that minimizes the variance of the state estimation error, based on the statistical properties of the system, namely the process noise covariance $Q$ and the measurement noise covariance $R$. The resulting observer poles are not directly specified by the designer but are an outcome of this optimization. The Kalman filter provides the best possible estimate in the mean-square sense by systematically balancing the confidence in the system model against the confidence in the measurements. The pole placement method enforces a desired behavior, while the Kalman filter derives an optimal behavior from the underlying stochastic reality of the system.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 7 & 10 & \\sqrt{3} & 1 \\end{pmatrix}}\n$$", "id": "2748160"}]}
