These are lines of constant damping ratio $\\zeta$. A larger damping ratio (closer to $1$) corresponds to an angle $\\phi$ closer to $\\pi$ ($180^\\circ$), meaning the poles are closer to the negative real axis. The maximum damping ratio for complex poles on a root locus branch is achieved at the point where the locus is tangent to such a ray, which corresponds to the largest angle $\\phi \\in (90^\\circ, 180^\\circ)$ attained by any point on the locus branch in the left-half plane.\n\nThe root locus branch in consideration starts on the real axis (breakaway between poles at $s=0$ and $s=-3$, where $\\zeta=1$), enters the second quadrant (where $0 < \\zeta < 1$), crosses the imaginary axis (where $\\zeta=0$), enters the first quadrant (where $\\zeta < 0$, corresponding to instability), and finally terminates at the right-half-plane (RHP) zero $s_z=1+j2$ as $K \\to \\infty$.\n\nThe computed angle of arrival, $\\theta_a = -164.1^\\circ$, defines the angle of the tangent to the locus at its termination point, $s_z$.

This precise end-condition constrains the entire shape of the trajectory.\n\nThe geometric constraint on the damping ratio arises from two conflicting geometric requirements on the locus branch:\n1.  To achieve a high damping ratio $\\zeta$, the locus must pass through regions close to the negative real axis, i.e., at angles close to $180^\\circ$.\n2.  The locus must terminate at the RHP zero $s_z = 1+j2$, and its shape must conform to the arrival angle constraint $\\theta_a = -164.1^\\circ$.\n\nA trajectory that remains close to the negative real axis is relatively straight. However, to reach the RHP zero and satisfy the specific, non-trivial arrival angle, the locus must curve significantly away from the negative real axis and cross into the RHP. The arrival angle is a quantitative measure of the \"pull\" exerted by the full configuration of poles and zeros on the locus shape near its endpoint. This required curvature prevents the locus from simultaneously staying in the high-damping-ratio region. Therefore, the arrival angle, by dictating the terminal geometry of the locus, implicitly imposes an upper bound on the maximum angle $\\phi$ the locus can attain in the second quadrant, which in turn bounds the maximum achievable damping ratio $\\zeta_{max}$ for any stable complex pole on that branch to a value strictly less than $1$.\n\nSymbolically, the maximum damping ratio $\\zeta_{max}$ is obtained at a point $s_{max}$ on the locus where the locus tangent angle $\\alpha(s_{max})$ equals the point's angle $\\phi(s_{max}) = \\arg(s_{max})$. The arrival angle $\\theta_a = \\lim_{s \\to s_z} \\alpha(s)$ acts as a boundary condition on the tangent angle function $\\alpha(s)$ along the locus. This boundary condition restricts the possible values of $\\alpha(s)$ over the entire branch, including the value $\\alpha(s_{max})$ that determines $\\zeta_{max} = \\cos(\\pi - \\alpha(s_{max}))$.
