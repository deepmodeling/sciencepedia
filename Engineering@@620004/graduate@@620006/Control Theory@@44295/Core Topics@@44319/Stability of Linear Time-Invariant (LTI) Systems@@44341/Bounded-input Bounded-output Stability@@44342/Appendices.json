It is scientifically sound, well-posed, and objective.\n- **Action**: Proceed with the solution.\n\nThe solution is developed in two parts as requested.\n\n**Part 1: Computation of the $\\ell_{1}$ norm of the impulse response**\nThe $\\ell_1$ norm of the impulse response $h[k]$ is defined as $\\|h\\|_1 = \\sum_{k=-\\infty}^{\\infty} |h[k]|$.\nGiven that the system is causal, $h[k]=0$ for all $k0$. The summation can therefore be restricted to non-negative indices:\n$$ \\|h\\|_1 = \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} |h[k]| $$\nThe impulse response for $k \\ge 0$ is given as $h[k]=\\alpha^k$. Substituting this into the summation yields:\n$$ \\|h\\|_1 = \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} |\\alpha^k| $$\nUsing the property of the modulus of a complex number, $|\\alpha^k| = |\\alpha|^k$, we have:\n$$ \\|h\\|_1 = \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} |\\alpha|^k $$\nThis is a geometric series with the first term being $|\\alpha|^0 = 1$ and the common ratio being $r=|\\alpha|$. The problem states that $|\\alpha|1$. A geometric series $\\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} r^k$ converges to $\\frac{1}{1-r}$ if and only if $|r|1$. Since this condition is satisfied, the sum converges to:\n$$ \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} |h[k]| = \\frac{1}{1 - |\\alpha|} $$\n\n**Part 2: Derivation of the minimal bound constant $K$**\nWe are looking for the minimal constant $K$ such that for any input $u[n]$ with $\\|u\\|_{\\infty} \\le 1$, the output $y[n]$ satisfies $\\|y\\|_{\\infty} \\le K$. The norm $\\|y\\|_{\\infty}$ is defined as $\\sup_{n \\in \\mathbb{Z}} |y[n]|$.\n\nThe output $y[n]$ is given by the convolution sum:\n$$ y[n] = \\sum_{k=-\\infty}^{\\infty} h[k] u[n-k] $$\nSince the system is causal, this sum becomes:\n$$ y[n] = \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} h[k] u[n-k] $$\nTo find a bound on $\\|y\\|_{\\infty}$, we first find a bound on $|y[n]|$ for an arbitrary integer $n$. Taking the absolute value of both sides:\n$$ |y[n]| = \\left| \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} h[k] u[n-k] \\right| $$\nApplying the triangle inequality, which states that $|\\sum_{i} z_i| \\le \\sum_{i} |z_i|$, we get:\n$$ |y[n]| \\le \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} |h[k] u[n-k]| $$\nUsing the property $|ab| = |a||b|$, this becomes:\n$$ |y[n]| \\le \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} |h[k]| |u[n-k]| $$\nThe input is bounded such that $\\|u\\|_{\\infty} \\le 1$, which implies $|u[m]| \\le 1$ for all integers $m$. Therefore, $|u[n-k]| \\le 1$ for any $n$ and $k$. Substituting this into the inequality:\n$$ |y[n]| \\le \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} |h[k]| \\cdot 1 = \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} |h[k]| $$\nThe right-hand side is the $\\ell_1$ norm of the impulse response, $\\|h\\|_1$, which we calculated in Part 1. This bound holds for any $n$. Therefore, the supremum of $|y[n]|$ over all $n$ must also be less than or equal to this value:\n$$ \\|y\\|_{\\infty} = \\sup_{n \\in \\mathbb{Z}} |y[n]| \\le \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} |h[k]| = \\frac{1}{1-|\\alpha|} $$\nThis establishes that $K = \\frac{1}{1-|\\alpha|}$ is a valid bound.\n\nTo show that this is the minimal (i.e., tightest) possible bound, we must demonstrate that this bound can be achieved for some input $u[n]$ satisfying $\\|u\\|_{\\infty} \\le 1$. The supremum of the output norms over all valid inputs is, by definition, the induced norm of the system operator, which is known to be $\\|h\\|_1$. We will construct an input that achieves this output magnitude.\n\nConsider the output at a specific time, for example, $n=0$:\n$$ y[0] = \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} h[k] u[-k] $$\nWe want to choose the input sequence $u[-k]$ to maximize $|y[0]|$. The triangle inequality used previously, $|y[0]| \\le \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} |h[k]||u[-k]|$, becomes an equality if all the terms $h[k]u[-k]$ are non-negative real numbers, or more generally, have the same phase.\nLet's choose the input $u[-k]$ to be the complex conjugate of the sign of $h[k]$, which is $u[-k] = \\frac{h^*[k]}{|h[k]|}$ for $h[k] \\neq 0$.\nSo we define an input signal $u[m]$ as follows:\n$$ u[m] = \\begin{cases} \\frac{h^*[-m]}{|h^*[-m]|}  \\text{for } m \\le 0 \\text{ and } h[-m] \\neq 0 \\\\ 0  \\text{otherwise} \\end{cases} $$\nFor our specific impulse response $h[k]=\\alpha^k$, we have $h[k] \\neq 0$ for all $k \\ge 0$. So for $m \\le 0$, we have $-m \\ge 0$, and we can define the input:\n$$ u[m] = \\frac{(\\alpha^{-m})^*}{|\\alpha^{-m}|} = \\frac{(\\alpha^*)^{-m}}{|\\alpha|^{-m}} \\quad \\text{for } m \\le 0 $$\nand $u[m]=0$ for $m  0$. For this input, $|u[m]|=1$ for $m \\le 0$ and $|u[m]|=0$ for $m  0$. Thus, $\\|u\\|_{\\infty} = 1$, and this is a valid input for our analysis.\n\nNow, let us compute the output $y[0]$ for this specific input:\n$$ y[0] = \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} h[k] u[-k] = \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} h[k] \\frac{h^*[k]}{|h^*[k]|} = \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} \\frac{|h[k]|^2}{|h[k]|} = \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} |h[k]| $$\nThis shows that for this particular input, the output magnitude at time $n=0$ is exactly equal to $\\|h\\|_1$.\nSince $\\|y\\|_{\\infty} = \\sup_n |y[n]| \\ge |y[0]|$, we have $\\|y\\|_{\\infty} \\ge \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} |h[k]|$.\n\nCombining our two findings:\n1. $\\|y\\|_{\\infty} \\le \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} |h[k]|$ for all inputs with $\\|u\\|_{\\infty} \\le 1$.\n2. There exists an input with $\\|u\\|_{\\infty} = 1$ for which $\\|y\\|_{\\infty} \\ge \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} |h[k]|$.\n\nThis proves that the minimal possible value for the bound $K$ is precisely the $\\ell_1$ norm of the impulse response.\n$$ K_{\\min} = \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} |h[k]| = \\frac{1}{1-|\\alpha|} $$\nThe first requested value is $\\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty}|h[k]|$, which is $\\frac{1}{1-|\\alpha|}$.

It is a standard problem in the analysis of linear time-invariant systems. We will proceed with the solution.\n\nThe system is a single-input single-output (SISO) linear time-invariant (LTI) causal system with transfer function $G(s)=\\dfrac{s+4}{s^{2}+3s+2}$. The output $y(t)$ is related to the input $u(t)$ via the convolution integral $y(t) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty}h(\\tau)u(t-\\tau)\\,d\\tau$, where $h(t)$ is the causal impulse response.\n\nFirst, we address the pole locations and their relation to BIBO stability. The poles of $G(s)$ are the roots of the denominator polynomial $s^{2}+3s+2=0$. Factoring the polynomial gives $(s+1)(s+2)=0$. Thus, the poles are located at $s_1 = -1$ and $s_2 = -2$. Both poles are real, distinct, and located in the open left-half of the complex plane, i.e., $\\text{Re}(s_k)  0$ for $k=1, 2$.\n\nFor a causal LTI system, the impulse response $h(t)$ is the inverse Laplace transform of $G(s)$ with a region of convergence being a right-half plane to the right of all poles. The structure of $h(t)$ for $t \\ge 0$ is determined by the poles. Simple poles $p_k$ contribute terms of the form $C_k \\exp(p_k t)$ to $h(t)$. Since both poles $s_1 = -1$ and $s_2 = -2$ have negative real parts, the corresponding terms in $h(t)$, which will be of the form $C_1 \\exp(-t)$ and $C_2 \\exp(-2t)$, decay exponentially to zero as $t \\to \\infty$. This exponential decay ensures that the impulse response is absolutely integrable, i.e., $\\int_{0}^{\\infty} |h(\\tau)| \\, d\\tau  \\infty$. As we shall derive next, this condition is precisely the requirement for BIBO stability.\n\nWe now derive the BIBO stability condition from first principles. The output is given by $y(t) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} h(\\tau) u(t-\\tau) \\, d\\tau$. We take the absolute value of both sides:\n$$|y(t)| = \\left| \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} h(\\tau) u(t-\\tau) \\, d\\tau \\right|$$\nUsing the triangle inequality for integrals, which states that $|\\int f(x) dx| \\le \\int |f(x)| dx$, we obtain:\n$$|y(t)| \\le \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} |h(\\tau) u(t-\\tau)| \\, d\\tau = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} |h(\\tau)| |u(t-\\tau)| \\, d\\tau$$\nThe input $u(t)$ is bounded, meaning there exists a finite constant $\\|u\\|_{\\infty} = \\text{ess sup}_{t} |u(t)|  \\infty$. Therefore, for almost every value of its argument, $|u(t-\\tau)| \\le \\|u\\|_{\\infty}$. Substituting this into the inequality yields:\n$$|y(t)| \\le \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} |h(\\tau)| \\|u\\|_{\\infty} \\, d\\tau$$\nSince $\\|u\\|_{\\infty}$ is a constant with respect to the integration variable $\\tau$, we can factor it out of the integral:\n$$|y(t)| \\le \\|u\\|_{\\infty} \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} |h(\\tau)| \\, d\\tau$$\nThis inequality must hold for all $t$. The essential supremum of the left side, $\\|y\\|_{\\infty}$, must therefore also satisfy this bound:\n$$\\|y\\|_{\\infty} \\le \\|u\\|_{\\infty} \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} |h(\\tau)| \\, d\\tau$$\nFor the output $y(t)$ to be bounded for any bounded input $u(t)$, the term multiplying $\\|u\\|_{\\infty}$ must be a finite constant. This means the system is BIBO stable if the impulse response is absolutely integrable:\n$$M = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} |h(\\tau)| \\, d\\tau  \\infty$$\nThis integral is the $L^1$-norm of $h(t)$. The bound is of the form $\\|y\\|_{\\infty} \\le M \\|u\\|_{\\infty}$. To show that this $M$ is the smallest possible constant, one must demonstrate there exists an input for which the bound is achieved. Consider the bounded input $u_0(t) = \\text{sgn}(h(-t))$, which has $\\|u_0\\|_{\\infty} = 1$. The output at $t=0$ for this input is:\n$$y(0) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} h(\\tau) u_0(-\\tau) \\, d\\tau = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} h(\\tau) \\text{sgn}(h(\\tau)) \\, d\\tau = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} |h(\\tau)| \\, d\\tau = M$$\nSince $\\|y\\|_{\\infty} \\ge |y(0)|$, we have $\\|y\\|_{\\infty} \\ge M$. Combined with the derived inequality $\\|y\\|_{\\infty} \\le M \\|u_0\\|_{\\infty} = M$, it follows that for this particular input, $\\|y\\|_{\\infty} = M$. Thus, no constant smaller than $M = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} |h(\\tau)| d\\tau$ can serve as a universal bound.\n\nNext, we compute $h(t)$ for the given $G(s)$. We use partial fraction expansion:\n$$G(s) = \\frac{s+4}{(s+1)(s+2)} = \\frac{A}{s+1} + \\frac{B}{s+2}$$\nThe coefficients $A$ and $B$ are found using the residue method:\n$$A = \\left. (s+1)G(s) \\right|_{s=-1} = \\left. \\frac{s+4}{s+2} \\right|_{s=-1} = \\frac{-1+4}{-1+2} = 3$$\n$$B = \\left. (s+2)G(s) \\right|_{s=-2} = \\left. \\frac{s+4}{s+1} \\right|_{s=-2} = \\frac{-2+4}{-2+1} = -2$$\nSo, the transfer function is $G(s) = \\frac{3}{s+1} - \\frac{2}{s+2}$.\nThe system is causal, so the impulse response $h(t)$ is the inverse Laplace transform of $G(s)$ for $t \\ge 0$, and $h(t)=0$ for $t  0$. Using the standard transform pair $\\mathcal{L}^{-1}\\{\\frac{1}{s+a}\\} = \\exp(-at)u_{step}(t)$, where $u_{step}(t)$ is the Heaviside step function, we find:\n$$h(t) = (3\\exp(-t) - 2\\exp(-2t)) u_{step}(t)$$\n\nFinally, we compute the constant $M$. Since the system is causal, $h(\\tau)=0$ for $\\tau  0$. The integral becomes:\n$$M = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} |3\\exp(-\\tau) - 2\\exp(-2\\tau)| \\, d\\tau$$\nWe must determine the sign of the integrand $f(\\tau) = 3\\exp(-\\tau) - 2\\exp(-2\\tau)$ for $\\tau \\ge 0$. Let $x = \\exp(-\\tau)$. For $\\tau \\ge 0$, we have $0  x \\le 1$. The expression becomes $3x - 2x^2 = x(3-2x)$. Since $x  0$, the sign is determined by $3-2x$. The condition $3-2x \\ge 0$ implies $x \\le \\frac{3}{2}$. As $x = \\exp(-\\tau) \\le 1$ for all $\\tau \\ge 0$, the condition $x \\le \\frac{3}{2}$ is always satisfied. Therefore, $h(\\tau) \\ge 0$ for all $\\tau \\ge 0$, and the absolute value can be removed.\nThe integral for $M$ simplifies to:\n$$M = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} (3\\exp(-\\tau) - 2\\exp(-2\\tau)) \\, d\\tau$$\nWe evaluate the integral:\n$$M = \\left[ \\frac{3\\exp(-\\tau)}{-1} - \\frac{2\\exp(-2\\tau)}{-2} \\right]_{0}^{\\infty} = \\left[ -3\\exp(-\\tau) + \\exp(-2\\tau) \\right]_{0}^{\\infty}$$\nEvaluating at the limits:\n$$M = \\lim_{\\tau \\to \\infty} (-3\\exp(-\\tau) + \\exp(-2\\tau)) - (-3\\exp(0) + \\exp(0))$$\n$$M = (0 + 0) - (-3 \\cdot 1 + 1) = 0 - (-2) = 2$$\nThe exact value of the constant is $2$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{2}$$", "id": "2691098"}, {"introduction": "What happens when a system's poles lie on the boundary of the stable region?

It asks for a demonstration from first principles, which is a legitimate and instructive pedagogical task.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is determined to be **valid**. A rigorous solution will now be constructed.\n\nWe begin the analysis. The problem is a direct application of fundamental principles and requires no advanced theorems, only meticulous calculation.\n\nFirst, we analyze the poles of the given transfer function, $G(s) = \\dfrac{s+2}{s(s+1)}$. The poles are the roots of the denominator polynomial, $s(s+1) = 0$. This equation yields two poles: $s_1 = 0$ and $s_2 = -1$. The pole at $s_1 = 0$ is a simple pole located on the imaginary axis, at the origin. The pole at $s_2 = -1$ is a simple pole in the open left-half complex plane. Therefore, all poles of the system lie in the closed left-half plane, which includes the imaginary axis. The condition stated in the problem is satisfied.\n\nNext, we compute the impulse response, $h(t)$, which is the inverse Laplace transform of $G(s)$. To do this, we first perform a partial fraction expansion of $G(s)$:\n$$ G(s) = \\frac{s+2}{s(s+1)} = \\frac{A}{s} + \\frac{B}{s+1} $$\nThe coefficients $A$ and $B$ are found using the residue method.\nFor the coefficient $A$:\n$$ A = \\lim_{s \\to 0} s G(s) = \\lim_{s \\to 0} s \\frac{s+2}{s(s+1)} = \\lim_{s \\to 0} \\frac{s+2}{s+1} = \\frac{0+2}{0+1} = 2 $$\nFor the coefficient $B$:\n$$ B = \\lim_{s \\to -1} (s+1) G(s) = \\lim_{s \\to -1} (s+1) \\frac{s+2}{s(s+1)} = \\lim_{s \\to -1} \\frac{s+2}{s} = \\frac{-1+2}{-1} = -1 $$\nThus, the expanded transfer function is:\n$$ G(s) = \\frac{2}{s} - \\frac{1}{s+1} $$\nNow, we find the impulse response $h(t) = \\mathcal{L}^{-1}\\{G(s)\\}$. Using standard Laplace transform pairs and the linearity of the transform, and applying the given definition of the Heaviside function $H(t)$:\n$$ h(t) = \\mathcal{L}^{-1}\\left\\{\\frac{2}{s}\\right\\} - \\mathcal{L}^{-1}\\left\\{\\frac{1}{s+1}\\right\\} = 2 H(t) - \\exp(-t) H(t) $$\nFor $t \\ge 0$, this simplifies to:\n$$ h(t) = 2 - \\exp(-t) $$\n\nThe next step is to demonstrate that a bounded input can produce an unbounded output. We choose the bounded input $x(t) = H(t)$, which is the unit step function. The magnitude of this input is bounded by $|x(t)| \\le 1$ for all $t$. The output $y(t)$ is the convolution of the impulse response $h(t)$ with the input $x(t)$:\n$$ y(t) = (h * x)(t) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} h(\\tau) x(t-\\tau) d\\tau $$\nSubstituting the expressions for $h(t)$ and $x(t)$:\n$$ y(t) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} [ (2 - \\exp(-\\tau))H(\\tau) ] [ H(t-\\tau) ] d\\tau $$\nThe product of the Heaviside functions $H(\\tau)H(t-\\tau)$ is equal to $1$ only when $\\tau \\ge 0$ and $t-\\tau \\ge 0$, which is equivalent to the interval $0 \\le \\tau \\le t$. This is valid for $t \\ge 0$. For $t  0$, the integral is $0$. We are concerned with the system's behavior for $t \\ge 0$. The integral becomes:\n$$ y(t) = \\int_{0}^{t} (2 - \\exp(-\\tau)) d\\tau \\quad \\text{for } t \\ge 0 $$\nWe evaluate this elementary integral:\n$$ y(t) = \\left[ 2\\tau - (-\\exp(-\\tau)) \\right]_{0}^{t} = \\left[ 2\\tau + \\exp(-\\tau) \\right]_{0}^{t} $$\n$$ y(t) = (2t + \\exp(-t)) - (2(0) + \\exp(-0)) = (2t + \\exp(-t)) - (0 + 1) $$\n$$ y(t) = 2t + \\exp(-t) - 1 $$\nThis is the closed-form expression for the output $y(t)$ for $t \\ge 0$.\n\nFinally, we must show that this output is unbounded. We examine the limit of $y(t)$ as $t \\to \\infty$:\n$$ \\lim_{t \\to \\infty} y(t) = \\lim_{t \\to \\infty} (2t + \\exp(-t) - 1) $$\nAs $t \\to \\infty$, the term $2t$ grows without bound ($2t \\to \\infty$), and the term $\\exp(-t)$ decays to zero ($\\exp(-t) \\to 0$). Therefore:\n$$ \\lim_{t \\to \\infty} y(t) = \\infty $$\nThe output $y(t)$ is unbounded. We have taken a bounded input, $x(t) = H(t)$, and produced an unbounded output. This proves, by construction and from first principles, that the system is not bounded-input, bounded-output (BIBO) stable. This result is a direct consequence of the pole at the origin, which acts as an integrator. The step input provides a constant value that is integrated over time, resulting in a ramp function that grows linearly and is thus unbounded.\nThe final expression for the output $y(t)$ for $t \\ge 0$ is the answer required.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{2t + \\exp(-t) - 1}\n$$", "id": "2691088"}]}
