It is scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and contains all necessary information for a unique solution via the specified methodology. We shall proceed with the solution.\n\nThe problem requires an analysis of the internal asymptotic stability of a system characterized by the polynomial $p(s) = s^{4} + 2 s^{3} + 3 s^{2} + 4 s + 5$. According to fundamental principles of control theory, a system is asymptotically stable if and only if all roots of its characteristic polynomial lie strictly in the open left half of the complex plane, defined as $\\{ s \\in \\mathbb{C} : \\Re(s) < 0 \\}$. The Routh-Hurwitz stability criterion provides a systematic procedure for determining the number of roots in the open right half-plane ($\\Re(s) > 0$) without explicitly solving for the roots.\n\nThe criterion proceeds by constructing a Routh array from the coefficients of the polynomial $p(s) = a_n s^n + a_{n-1} s^{n-1} + \\dots + a_1 s + a_0$. For the given fourth-order polynomial, we have $n=4$ and the coefficients are $a_4=1$, $a_3=2$, $a_2=3$, $a_1=4$, and $a_0=5$. A necessary, but not sufficient, condition for stability is that all coefficients $a_i$ must be positive. This condition is met, so we must proceed with the full Routh array construction.\n\nThe Routh array is constructed as follows:\n\nThe first two rows are formed directly from the polynomial coefficients. The first row contains the coefficients of the even powers of $s$, starting from the highest power. The second row contains the coefficients of the odd powers of $s$.\n\nRow $s^4$: The coefficients are $a_4=1$, $a_2=3$, $a_0=5$.\nRow $s^3$: The coefficients are $a_3=2$, $a_1=4$. We append a zero for subsequent calculations.\n\nThe initial state of the array is:\n$$\n\\begin{array}{c|ccc}\ns^4 & 1 & 3 & 5 \\\\\ns^3 & 2 & 4 & 0\n\\end{array}\n$$\n\nSubsequent rows are computed using the elements of the two preceding rows. Let the elements of row $s^k$ be denoted by $r_{k,j}$. Then the elements of row $s^{k-2}$ are computed as $r_{k-2,j} = -\\frac{1}{r_{k-1,1}} \\det \\begin{pmatrix} r_{k,1} & r_{k, j+1} \\\\ r_{k-1,1} & r_{k-1, j+1} \\end{pmatrix}$.\n\nRow $s^2$: The elements, let us call them $b_1, b_2, \\dots$, are computed from the $s^4$ and $s^3$ rows.\nThe first element is $b_1 = -\\frac{\\det\\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 3 \\\\ 2 & 4 \\end{pmatrix}}{2} = -\\frac{(1)(4) - (3)(2)}{2} = -\\frac{4-6}{2} = 1$.\nThe second element is $b_2 = -\\frac{\\det\\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 5 \\\\ 2 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}}{2} = -\\frac{(1)(0) - (5)(2)}{2} = -\\frac{-10}{2} = 5$.\nThe third element is $b_3 = -\\frac{\\det\\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 2 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}}{2} = 0$.\n\nThe array now stands as:\n$$\n\\begin{array}{c|ccc}\ns^4 & 1 & 3 & 5 \\\\\ns^3 & 2 & 4 & 0 \\\\\ns^2 & 1 & 5 & 0\n\\end{array}\n$$\nEach of these computed entries—$b_1=1$ and $b_2=5$—forms the coefficients of an auxiliary polynomial that plays an intermediate role in the stability test. The fact that $b_1=1$ is a positive number means that, up to this stage, no instability has been conclusively detected.\n\nRow $s^1$: The elements, let us call them $c_1, c_2, \\dots$, are computed from the $s^3$ and $s^2$ rows.\nThe first element is $c_1 = -\\frac{\\det\\begin{pmatrix} 2 & 4 \\\\ 1 & 5 \\end{pmatrix}}{1} = -\\frac{(2)(5) - (4)(1)}{1} = -\\frac{10-4}{1} = -6$.\nThe second element is $c_2 = -\\frac{\\det\\begin{pmatrix} 2 & 0 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}}{1} = -\\frac{(2)(0) - (0)(1)}{1} = 0$.\n\nThe array becomes:\n$$\n\\begin{array}{c|ccc}\ns^4 & 1 & 3 & 5 \\\\\ns^3 & 2 & 4 & 0 \\\\\ns^2 & 1 & 5 & 0 \\\\\ns^1 & -6 & 0 & 0\n\\end{array}\n$$\nThe computation of $c_1 = -6$ is a critical step. A negative value in the first column of the Routh array signifies that the polynomial has roots in the right half-plane, and thus the system is unstable.\n\nRow $s^0$: The element, let us call it $d_1$, is computed from the $s^2$ and $s^1$ rows.\nThe first element is $d_1 = -\\frac{\\det\\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 5 \\\\ -6 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}}{-6} = -\\frac{(1)(0) - (5)(-6)}{-6} = -\\frac{30}{-6} = 5$.\n\nThe complete Routh array is:\n$$\n\\begin{array}{c|ccc}\ns^4 & 1 & 3 & 5 \\\\\ns^3 & 2 & 4 & 0 \\\\\ns^2 & 1 & 5 & 0 \\\\\ns^1 & -6 & 0 & 0 \\\\\ns^0 & 5 & 0 & 0\n\\end{array}\n$$\n\nTo determine the number of roots in the open right half-plane ($\\Re(s) > 0$), we inspect the signs of the elements in the first column of the array: $[1, 2, 1, -6, 5]$.\nThe sequence of signs is $(+, +, +, -, +)$.\nThere is a sign change from the $s^2$ row ($1$) to the $s^1$ row ($-6$). This is the first sign change.\nThere is a second sign change from the $s^1$ row ($-6$) to the $s^0$ row ($5$).\n\nThe total number of sign changes in the first column is $2$.\nAccording to the Routh-Hurwitz criterion, the number of sign changes in the first column is equal to the number of roots of the polynomial with positive real parts. Therefore, the characteristic polynomial $p(s)$ has exactly $2$ roots in the open right half-plane.\n\nThe degree of the polynomial is $n=4$, so it has a total of $4$ roots. Let $N_{RHP}$, $N_{LHP}$, and $N_{j\\omega}$ be the number of roots in the right half-plane, left half-plane, and on the imaginary axis, respectively. We have $N_{RHP} + N_{LHP} + N_{j\\omega} = 4$. From our analysis, $N_{RHP} = 2$. Since no row in the Routh array became entirely zero, there are no roots on the imaginary axis ($N_{j\\omega}=0$). Consequently, the number of roots in the open left half-plane is $N_{LHP} = 4 - N_{RHP} - N_{j\\omega} = 4 - 2 - 0 = 2$.\n\nThe presence of $2$ roots in the right half-plane means the system is unstable. The problem asks for the number of roots that lie strictly in the open right half-plane. This number is precisely the number of sign changes found in the first column of the Routh array.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{2}\n$$", "id": "2713212"}, {"introduction": "A system can sometimes appear stable from its input-output behavior while harboring a dangerously unstable internal mode.

It requires the evaluation of internal stability, controllability, and input-output properties based on a given state-space realization. The problem is well-defined, scientifically grounded, and provides all necessary information for a complete analysis. It is therefore a valid problem.\n\nWe are given the continuous-time LTI system:\n$$\n\\dot{\\mathbf{x}}(t) = A \\mathbf{x}(t) + B u(t)\n$$\n$$\ny(t) = C \\mathbf{x}(t) + D u(t)\n$$\nwith the matrices:\n$$\nA = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -2 \\end{pmatrix}, \\quad B = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}, \\quad C = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}, \\quad D = 0\n$$\n\nThe analysis will proceed in three steps as requested: internal stability, controllability, and transfer function analysis.\n\n**1. Internal Asymptotic Stability**\n\nInternal (or state) stability concerns the behavior of the autonomous system, which is described by setting the external input $u(t)$ to zero:\n$$\n\\dot{\\mathbf{x}}(t) = A \\mathbf{x}(t)\n$$\nA linear time-invariant system is defined as internally asymptotically stable if, for any initial condition $\\mathbf{x}(0)$, the state vector $\\mathbf{x}(t)$ converges to the zero vector as time $t$ approaches infinity. That is, $\\lim_{t \\to \\infty} \\mathbf{x}(t) = \\mathbf{0}$.\n\nFrom the theory of linear ordinary differential equations, the solution to this autonomous system is of the form $\\mathbf{x}(t) = \\exp(At) \\mathbf{x}(0)$. The convergence of $\\mathbf{x}(t)$ to $\\mathbf{0}$ is determined entirely by the eigenvalues of the state matrix $A$. The system is asymptotically stable if and only if all eigenvalues of $A$ have strictly negative real parts.\n\nThe given state matrix is:\n$$\nA = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -2 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nSince $A$ is a diagonal matrix, its eigenvalues are simply its diagonal entries. The eigenvalues are $\\lambda_1 = 1$ and $\\lambda_2 = -2$.\n\nThe real parts of the eigenvalues are $\\text{Re}(\\lambda_1) = 1$ and $\\text{Re}(\\lambda_2) = -2$. The eigenvalue $\\lambda_1 = 1$ has a positive real part. The presence of an eigenvalue with a positive real part implies that there is a mode of the system that grows exponentially with time ($\\exp(1t)$). Therefore, the system is not asymptotically stable; it is unstable.\n\n**2. Controllability Analysis**\n\nControllability of the pair $(A, B)$ determines whether it is possible to steer the state of the system from any initial state to any final state within a finite time interval using some control input $u(t)$. For an LTI system of state dimension $n$, a necessary and sufficient condition for controllability is that the controllability matrix, $\\mathcal{C}$, has full rank, i.e., $\\text{rank}(\\mathcal{C}) = n$.\n\nThe state dimension is $n=2$. The controllability matrix is constructed as:\n$$\n\\mathcal{C} = \\begin{pmatrix} B & AB \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nWe have $B = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}$. We compute the product $AB$:\n$$\nAB = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -2 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} (1)(0) + (0)(1) \\\\ (0)(0) + (-2)(1) \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ -2 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nNow, we form the controllability matrix $\\mathcal{C}$:\n$$\n\\mathcal{C} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 \\\\ 1 & -2 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nTo check if $\\mathcal{C}$ has full rank, we can compute its determinant.\n$$\n\\det(\\mathcal{C}) = (0)(-2) - (0)(1) = 0\n$$\nSince the determinant is zero, the matrix $\\mathcal{C}$ is rank-deficient (its rank is $1$, not $2$). Therefore, the realization is **not controllable**.\n\nTo identify the uncontrollable mode, we use the Popov-Hautus-Belevitch (PBH) test. A mode associated with an eigenvalue $\\lambda$ of $A$ is uncontrollable if and only if $\\text{rank}\\begin{pmatrix} A - \\lambda I & B \\end{pmatrix} < n$.\n\nFor the eigenvalue $\\lambda_1 = 1$:\n$$\n\\begin{pmatrix} A - 1 \\cdot I & B \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1-1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -2-1 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -3 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe rank of this $2 \\times 3$ matrix is $1$, which is less than $n=2$. Thus, the mode associated with the unstable eigenvalue $\\lambda_1 = 1$ is uncontrollable.\n\nFor the eigenvalue $\\lambda_2 = -2$:\n$$\n\\begin{pmatrix} A - (-2) \\cdot I & B \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1-(-2) & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -2-(-2) & 1 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 3 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe rank of this matrix is $2$, which is equal to $n$. Thus, the mode associated with the stable eigenvalue $\\lambda_2 = -2$ is controllable.\n\nThe analysis concludes that the unstable mode of the system is uncontrollable.\n\n**3. Transfer Function and Bounded-Input Bounded-Output (BIBO) Stability**\n\nThe transfer function $G(s)$ of an LTI system relates the Laplace transform of the output, $Y(s)$, to the Laplace transform of the input, $U(s)$, under the assumption of zero initial conditions. It is given by the formula:\n$$\nG(s) = C (sI - A)^{-1} B + D\n$$\nFirst, we compute the matrix $(sI - A)$:\n$$\nsI - A = s \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} - \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -2 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} s-1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & s+2 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nNext, we find its inverse, $(sI - A)^{-1}$:\n$$\n(sI - A)^{-1} = \\frac{1}{\\det(sI-A)} \\text{adj}(sI-A) = \\frac{1}{(s-1)(s+2)} \\begin{pmatrix} s+2 & 0 \\\\ 0 & s-1 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{1}{s-1} & 0 \\\\ 0 & \\frac{1}{s+2} \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nNow, we can compute the transfer function $G(s)$, noting that $D=0$:\n$$\nG(s) = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{1}{s-1} & 0 \\\\ 0 & \\frac{1}{s+2} \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nPerforming the matrix multiplication:\n$$\nG(s) = \\begin{pmatrix} (0)\\frac{1}{s-1} + (1)(0) & (0)(0) + (1)\\frac{1}{s+2} \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\n$$\nG(s) = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & \\frac{1}{s+2} \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\n$$\nG(s) = (0)(0) + \\left(\\frac{1}{s+2}\\right)(1) = \\frac{1}{s+2}\n$$\nThe transfer function, simplified to its lowest terms, is $G(s) = \\frac{1}{s+2}$.\n\nA rational transfer function is strictly proper if the degree of the denominator polynomial is strictly greater than the degree of the numerator polynomial. Here, the denominator degree is $1$ and the numerator degree is $0$. Since $1 > 0$, the transfer function is strictly proper.\n\nBounded-input bounded-output (BIBO) stability requires that for every bounded input $u(t)$, the output $y(t)$ is also bounded. For an LTI system, this is equivalent to the condition that all poles of the transfer function $G(s)$ lie in the open left-half of the complex plane (i.e., have strictly negative real parts).\n\nThe transfer function is $G(s) = \\frac{1}{s+2}$. It has a single pole at $s = -2$. Since the real part of this pole is $-2$, which is negative, the system is BIBO stable.\n\nIt is crucial to note that the unstable pole of the system, located at $s=1$, does not appear in the transfer function. This is a direct consequence of the fact that this mode is uncontrollable. The input $u(t)$ has no influence on the state component associated with the eigenvalue $\\lambda_1 = 1$, and thus this unstable internal dynamic is \"hidden\" from the input-output relationship.

We can compute $T_{ry}(s)$ using two methods.\n\nMethod 1: Using the closed-loop state-space model $T_{ry}(s) = C_{cl}(sI - A_{cl})^{-1}B_{cl} + D_{cl}$.\n$$ (sI - A_{cl})^{-1} = \\begin{pmatrix} s & 1 \\\\ 1 & s \\end{pmatrix}^{-1} = \\frac{1}{s^2-1} \\begin{pmatrix} s & -1 \\\\ -1 & s \\end{pmatrix} $$\n$$ T_{ry}(s) = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{1}{2} & \\frac{1}{2} \\end{pmatrix} \\frac{1}{s^2-1} \\begin{pmatrix} s & -1 \\\\ -1 & s \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} -1 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix} + \\frac{1}{2} $$\n$$ T_{ry}(s) = \\frac{1}{2(s^2-1)} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} s & -1 \\\\ -1 & s \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} -1 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix} + \\frac{1}{2} $$\n$$ T_{ry}(s) = \\frac{1}{2(s^2-1)} \\begin{pmatrix} s-1 & s-1 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} -1 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix} + \\frac{1}{2} $$\n$$ T_{ry}(s) = \\frac{1}{2(s^2-1)} \\left( -(s-1) + (s-1) \\right) + \\frac{1}{2} = 0 + \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{1}{2} $$\n\nMethod 2: Using block diagram algebra $T_{ry}(s) = \\frac{P(s)K(s)}{1+P(s)K(s)}$.\nThe loop gain is $L(s) = P(s)K(s) = \\left(\\frac{s-1}{s+1}\\right)\\left(\\frac{s+1}{s-1}\\right) = 1$.\n$$ T_{ry}(s) = \\frac{L(s)}{1+L(s)} = \\frac{1}{1+1} = \\frac{1}{2} $$\nBoth methods yield $T_{ry}(s) = \\frac{1}{2}$. This transfer function is a constant, which has no poles. Vacuously, all its poles are in the open left-half plane. Therefore, the input-output map is BIBO stable.\n\nThe discrepancy between internal instability and BIBO stability is explained by a pole-zero cancellation of an unstable mode. In the frequency domain, the unstable pole of the controller $K(s)$ at $s=1$ is cancelled by the zero of the plant $P(s)$ at $s=1$. This cancellation hides the unstable dynamics from the input-output transfer function $T_{ry}(s)$.\n\nTo be more rigorous, we analyze the controllability and observability of the closed-loop system.\nThe controllability matrix is $\\mathcal{C} = \\begin{pmatrix} B_{cl} & A_{cl}B_{cl} \\end{pmatrix}$.\n$$ A_{cl}B_{cl} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & -1 \\\\ -1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}\\begin{pmatrix} -1 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} -1 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix} $$\n$$ \\mathcal{C} = \\begin{pmatrix} -1 & -1 \\\\ 1 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} $$\nSince $\\det(\\mathcal{C})=0$, the system is uncontrollable.\nThe observability matrix is $\\mathcal{O} = \\begin{pmatrix} C_{cl} \\\\ C_{cl}A_{cl} \\end{pmatrix}$.\n$$ C_{cl}A_{cl} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{1}{2} & \\frac{1}{2} \\end{pmatrix}\\begin{pmatrix} 0 & -1 \\\\ -1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} -\\frac{1}{2} & -\\frac{1}{2} \\end{pmatrix} $$\n$$ \\mathcal{O} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1/2 & 1/2 \\\\ -1/2 & -1/2 \\end{pmatrix} $$\nSince $\\det(\\mathcal{O})=0$, the system is unobservable.\n\nLet's identify the specific modes. The right eigenvectors of $A_{cl}$ are $v_1 = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ -1 \\end{pmatrix}$ for $\\lambda_1 = 1$, and $v_2 = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}$ for $\\lambda_2 = -1$.\nWe check observability of the modes. A mode is unobservable if the corresponding eigenvector lies in the null space of the observability matrix $\\mathcal{O}$.\nFor the unstable mode $\\lambda_1 = 1$:\n$$ \\mathcal{O}v_1 = \\begin{pmatrix} 1/2 & 1/2 \\\\ -1/2 & -1/2 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ -1 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix} $$\nThe eigenvector $v_1$ is in the null space of $\\mathcal{O}$. Thus, the unstable mode at $s=1$ is unobservable from the output $y(t)$. Because it is unobservable, it does not appear as a pole in the transfer function $T_{ry}(s)$. This is the precise reason for the discrepancy. Although a bounded reference input $r(t)$ will produce a bounded output $y(t)$, the internal states $x_p(t)$ and $x_k(t)$ will grow unboundedly, proportional to $\\exp(t)$, because the unstable mode is still present in the system's internal dynamics. This phenomenon is a classic example of why internal stability is a stronger and more fundamental requirement than BIBO stability for control system design.", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{\\frac{1}{2}} $$", "id": "2739244"}]}
