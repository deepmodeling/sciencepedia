It is well-posed, scientifically grounded, objective, and contains all necessary information for a unique solution. The definitions and constraints are standard and consistent with the established principles of the field. Therefore, the problem is deemed valid and a full solution can be derived.\n\nThe open-loop transfer function is given by\n$$\nL(s) = K \\frac{1}{s(s+4)(s+6)}\n$$\nwhere the gain $K$ is real and non-negative, i.e., $K \\ge 0$. The root locus is the set of all complex numbers $s$ that are roots of the closed-loop characteristic equation for some $K \\in [0, \\infty)$. The characteristic equation is defined as $1 + L(s) = 0$.\n\nSubstituting the expression for $L(s)$, we have:\n$$\n1 + K \\frac{1}{s(s+4)(s+6)} = 0\n$$\nThis equation must hold for any point $s$ on the root locus. For $s$ not being a pole of $L(s)$, we can rearrange this equation to express the gain $K$ as a function of $s$:\n$$\nK(s) = -s(s+4)(s+6)\n$$\nExpanding this expression gives:\n$$\nK(s) = -(s^3 + 10s^2 + 24s)\n$$\nA real-axis breakaway point, $s^\\star$, is a real value of $s$ where at least two branches of the root locus that lie on the real axis coalesce and depart into the complex plane. This occurs at a point where the characteristic equation has a multiple root for some value of $K \\ge 0$. If $s^\\star$ is a multiple root of $1+L(s)=0$, then the polynomial $P(s) = s(s+4)(s+6) + K$ must have a multiple root at $s=s^\\star$. A necessary condition for a polynomial to have a multiple root at $s^\\star$ is that its derivative with respect to $s$ must also be zero at $s^\\star$.\n\nAlternatively, and more directly as suggested by the problem, a breakaway point corresponds to a location on the real axis where the gain $K$ required to place a pole at that location is at a local maximum relative to neighboring real-axis points on the locus. This is because as $K$ increases, two real poles move toward each other, meet at the breakaway point (corresponding to the maximum $K$ on that segment), and then become a complex conjugate pair. Therefore, a necessary condition for a real-axis breakaway point is that the derivative of $K(s)$ with respect to $s$ must be zero.\n$$\n\\frac{dK}{ds} = 0\n$$\nWe now compute this derivative:\n$$\n\\frac{dK}{ds} = \\frac{d}{ds} \\left(-s^3 - 10s^2 - 24s\\right) = -3s^2 - 20s - 24\n$$\nSetting this derivative to zero gives the necessary condition for potential breakaway or break-in points:\n$$\n-3s^2 - 20s - 24 = 0\n$$\n$$\n3s^2 + 20s + 24 = 0\n$$\nThis is the derived necessary condition. We now solve this quadratic equation for $s$ to find the real candidates. Using the quadratic formula, $s = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$:\n$$\ns = \\frac{-20 \\pm \\sqrt{20^2 - 4(3)(24)}}{2(3)} = \\frac{-20 \\pm \\sqrt{400 - 288}}{6} = \\frac{-20 \\pm \\sqrt{112}}{6}\n$$\nThe discriminant is positive, so there are two real roots.

A point $s$ is on the root locus for $K \\ge 0$ if and only if it satisfies the angle criterion: $\\angle L(s) = (2m+1)\\pi$ for some integer $m$.\nFor our system, with $K \\ge 0$:\n$$\n\\angle \\left(K \\frac{1}{s(s+4)(s+6)}\\right) = \\angle(K) - \\angle(s) - \\angle(s+4) - \\angle(s+6) = (2m+1)\\pi\n$$\nSince $K \\ge 0$, $\\angle(K)=0$. For a point $s = \\sigma$ on the real axis, the angle of a term $(\\sigma - p)$ is $\\pi$ if $\\sigma  p$ and $0$ if $\\sigma  p$. The open-loop poles are at $p_1=0$, $p_2=-4$, and $p_3=-6$.\nThe condition becomes:\n$$\n-(\\angle(\\sigma-0) + \\angle(\\sigma-(-4)) + \\angle(\\sigma-(-6))) = (2m+1)\\pi\n$$\nThis rule simplifies to the well-known real-axis admissibility rule: a segment of the real axis is part of the root locus if and only if the total number of real open-loop poles and zeros to its right is odd.\n\nLet's apply this rule:\n1.  Segment $(-\\infty, -6)$: To the right, there are poles at $s=-6$, $s=-4$, and $s=0$ (total of $3$, which is odd). This segment is on the root locus.\n2.  Segment $(-6, -4)$: To the right, there are poles at $s=-4$ and $s=0$ (total of $2$, which is even). This segment is not on the root locus.\n3.  Segment $(-4, 0)$: To the right, there is one pole at $s=0$ (total of $1$, which is odd). This segment is on the root locus.\n4.  Segment $(0, \\infty)$: To the right, there are no poles or zeros (total of $0$, which is even). This segment is not on the root locus.\n\nThe admissible real-axis segments for the root locus are $(-\\infty, -6)$ and $(-4, 0)$. A breakaway point must lie on one of these segments. We now check the location of our candidates $s_1$ and $s_2$.\n\nFor $s_1 = \\frac{-10 + 2\\sqrt{7}}{3}$:\nWe know that $4  7  9$, so $2  \\sqrt{7}  3$.\nThen $4  2\\sqrt{7}  6$.\nSo, $-10+4  -10+2\\sqrt{7}  -10+6$, which simplifies to $-6  -10+2\\sqrt{7}  -4$.\nDividing by $3$ gives $-2  \\frac{-10+2\\sqrt{7}}{3}  -\\frac{4}{3}$.\nSince $-4  -2$ and $-\\frac{4}{3}  0$, we have established that $-4  s_1  0$. This point lies in the admissible segment $(-4, 0)$. Therefore, $s_1$ is a valid breakaway point.\n\nFor $s_2 = \\frac{-10 - 2\\sqrt{7}}{3}$:\nUsing $4  2\\sqrt{7}  6$, we have $-6  -2\\sqrt{7}  -4$.\nSo, $-10-6  -10-2\\sqrt{7}  -10-4$, which simplifies to $-16  -10-2\\sqrt{7}  -14$.\nDividing by $3$ gives $-\\frac{16}{3}  \\frac{-10-2\\sqrt{7}}{3}  -\\frac{14}{3}$.\n$-\\frac{16}{3} \\approx -5.33$ and $-\\frac{14}{3} \\approx -4.67$.\nSo, we have $-6  -5.33  s_2  -4.67  -4$.\nThis shows that $s_2$ lies in the interval $(-6, -4)$. This segment is not on the root locus for $K \\ge 0$. Therefore, $s_2$ is not an admissible breakaway point for this system. It is a break-in point for the root locus corresponding to $K0$.\n\nThe problem asks for the unique admissible real-axis breakaway abscissa, which we denote $s^{\\star}$. Based on our analysis, this is $s_1$.\n$$\ns^{\\star} = \\frac{-10 + 2\\sqrt{7}}{3}\n$$\nThis is the location on the real axis between the poles at $s=0$ and $s=-4$ where the two real roots of the characteristic equation meet and break away into the complex plane as $K$ increases.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\frac{-10 + 2\\sqrt{7}}{3}}\n$$", "id": "2901840"}, {"introduction": "Beyond just sketching the shape of the locus, its primary use is for stability analysis and controller design.

A unique and meaningful solution exists.\n- **Objective**: The problem is stated in precise, quantitative terms, free from any subjective or ambiguous language.\n\nThe problem does not violate any of the invalidity criteria. It is a completely standard and formal problem in control theory.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is deemed **valid**. A solution will be provided.\n\nThe closed-loop characteristic equation for a system in a negative unity-feedback loop is given by $1 + G(s) = 0$. Substituting the given open-loop transfer function $G(s) = \\frac{K\\,(s+1)}{(s+2)\\,(s+1+\\epsilon)}$, we obtain:\n$$\n1 + \\frac{K\\,(s+1)}{(s+2)\\,(s+1+\\epsilon)} = 0\n$$\nTo find the characteristic polynomial, we clear the denominator:\n$$\n(s+2)(s+1+\\epsilon) + K(s+1) = 0\n$$\nExpanding the terms yields:\n$$\ns^2 + s(1+\\epsilon) + 2s + 2(1+\\epsilon) + Ks + K = 0\n$$\nGrouping the terms by powers of $s$, we arrive at the characteristic polynomial $P(s)$:\n$$\nP(s) = s^2 + (3+\\epsilon+K)s + (2+2\\epsilon+K) = 0\n$$\nThis is the required characteristic polynomial for a general $\\epsilon \\ge 0$.\n\nNow, we consider the special case where $\\epsilon=0$. This corresponds to an exact pole-zero cancellation. The open-loop transfer function becomes $G(s) = \\frac{K(s+1)}{(s+2)(s+1)}$. A naive cancellation would suggest $G(s) = \\frac{K}{s+2}$, leading to the characteristic equation $1 + \\frac{K}{s+2} = 0$, or $s+2+K=0$. This would imply a single closed-loop pole at $s = -2-K$. This is an incorrect and dangerous simplification. The proper analysis uses the uncancelled characteristic equation: $(s+2)(s+1) + K(s+1) = 0$. This equation can be factored as:\n$$\n(s+1)(s+2+K) = 0\n$$\nThe roots are $s_1 = -1$ and $s_2 = -2-K$. This reveals there are two closed-loop poles. One pole is fixed at $s=-1$ for all $K \\ge 0$, a direct result of the pole-zero cancellation. This pole corresponds to a mode that is unobservable from the output and uncontrollable from the input. The second pole moves from $s=-2$ (for $K=0$) along the negative real axis towards $s \\to -\\infty$ as $K \\to \\infty$. The root locus consists of a stationary point at $s=-1$ and a branch from $s=-2$ to negative infinity.\n\nNext, for $\\epsilon  0$, we apply the Routh-Hurwitz stability criterion to the characteristic polynomial $P(s) = s^2 + (3+\\epsilon+K)s + (2+2\\epsilon+K) = 0$. For a second-order polynomial $a_2s^2 + a_1s + a_0 = 0$, the system is stable if and only if all coefficients $a_2, a_1, a_0$ have the same sign.\nThe coefficients are:\n- $a_2 = 1$\n- $a_1 = 3+\\epsilon+K$\n- $a_0 = 2+2\\epsilon+K$\n\nGiven that $K \\ge 0$ and we are analyzing for $\\epsilon  0$:\n- $a_2 = 1$, which is positive.\n- $a_1 = 3+\\epsilon+K  3$, strictly positive.\n- $a_0 = 2+2\\epsilon+K  2$, strictly positive.\n\nSince all coefficients are strictly positive for any finite $K \\ge 0$ and any $\\epsilon  0$, the two roots of the characteristic polynomial (the closed-loop poles) must lie in the open left half-plane. Consequently, there exists no finite value of $K \\ge 0$ for which the closed-loop poles cross into the open right half-plane. The system is stable for all non-negative gain and any such small modeling error $\\epsilon$.\n\nFinally, we derive the location $s_{\\star}(K,\\epsilon)$ of the closed-loop pole that approaches $s=-1$ as $K \\to \\infty$. The closed-loop poles are the roots of the quadratic equation $s^2 + (3+\\epsilon+K)s + (2+2\\epsilon+K) = 0$. We solve for $s$ using the quadratic formula, $s = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}$, with $a=1$, $b=3+\\epsilon+K$, and $c=2+2\\epsilon+K$.\nThe discriminant $\\Delta = b^2 - 4ac$ is:\n$$\n\\Delta = (3+\\epsilon+K)^2 - 4(1)(2+2\\epsilon+K)\n$$\n$$\n\\Delta = (K+(3+\\epsilon))^2 - 4K - 8 - 8\\epsilon\n$$\n$$\n\\Delta = K^2 + 2K(3+\\epsilon) + (3+\\epsilon)^2 - 4K - 8 - 8\\epsilon\n$$\n$$\n\\Delta = K^2 + (6K+2K\\epsilon) + (9+6\\epsilon+\\epsilon^2) - 4K - 8 - 8\\epsilon\n$$\n$$\n\\Delta = K^2 + (2K+2K\\epsilon) + (1-2\\epsilon+\\epsilon^2)\n$$\n$$\n\\Delta = K^2 + 2(1+\\epsilon)K + (1-\\epsilon)^2\n$$\nThe two closed-loop poles are therefore:\n$$\ns_{1,2} = \\frac{-(3+\\epsilon+K) \\pm \\sqrt{K^2 + 2(1+\\epsilon)K + (1-\\epsilon)^2}}{2}\n$$\nAs $K \\to \\infty$, the closed-loop poles approach the open-loop zeros. The open-loop transfer function $G(s)$ has one finite zero at $s=-1$. We must determine which root, $s_1$ or $s_2$, approaches this value. Let's analyze the behavior for large $K$.
