This is a crucial property, as it implies that the system is both completely controllable and completely observable. Consequently, there are no pole-zero cancellations in the transfer function, and the set of poles of the transfer function $G(s)$ is identical to the set of eigenvalues of the state matrix $A$.\n\nAccording to the provided definition, the transfer function is $G(s) = C(sI-A)^{-1}B+D$. The poles of $G(s)$ are the roots of the denominator of this rational function. The denominator is given by the characteristic polynomial of the matrix $A$, which is $\\det(sI-A)$. We must find the roots of the equation $\\det(sI-A) = 0$.\n\nFirst, we construct the matrix $sI-A$:\n$$\nsI - A = s \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} - \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 1 \\\\ -6 & -11 & -6 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} s & -1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & s & -1 \\\\ 6 & 11 & s+6 \\end{pmatrix}.\n$$\nNext, we compute its determinant.

We search for integer roots among the divisors of the constant term $6$, which are $\\{\\pm 1, \\pm 2, \\pm 3, \\pm 6\\}$.\nLet $p(s) = s^3 + 6s^2 + 11s + 6$.\nTesting $s = -1$:\n$$\np(-1) = (-1)^3 + 6(-1)^2 + 11(-1) + 6 = -1 + 6 - 11 + 6 = 0.\n$$\nThus, $s_1 = -1$ is a root, which means $(s+1)$ is a factor of the polynomial. We perform polynomial division to find the remaining factors:\n$$\n\\frac{s^3 + 6s^2 + 11s + 6}{s+1} = s^2 + 5s + 6.\n$$\nWe now find the roots of the quadratic factor $s^2 + 5s + 6 = 0$.

The system is internally stable if and only if all eigenvalues of $A$ have strictly negative real parts. The eigenvalues are the roots of the characteristic equation $\\det(\\lambda I - A) = 0$.\nFor the given matrix $A$, which is diagonal, the eigenvalues are its diagonal entries.\nThe eigenvalues are $\\lambda_1 = 1$ and $\\lambda_2 = -2$.\nSince the eigenvalue $\\lambda_1 = 1$ has a positive real part, $\\text{Re}(\\lambda_1) = 1 > 0$, the system is not internally stable. In fact, it is internally unstable. The presence of this eigenvalue means that for zero input, an initial state with a component in the direction of the corresponding eigenvector will grow exponentially as $e^{t}$, leading to an unbounded state vector.\n\nNext, we analyze the Bounded-Input–Bounded-Output (BIBO) stability of the input-output map.\nA system is defined as BIBO-stable if every bounded input signal produces a bounded output signal. For a continuous-time LTI system, this property is equivalent to the condition that all poles of its transfer function $G(s)$ lie in the open left-half of the complex plane, i.e., they must all have strictly negative real parts. The transfer function is given by the formula $G(s) = C(sI - A)^{-1}B + D$.\n\nWe compute the transfer function for the given realization.\nThe term $(sI-A)$ is\n$$\nsI - A = s\\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} - \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -2 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} s-1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & s+2 \\end{pmatrix}.\n$$\nIts inverse is\n$$\n(sI - A)^{-1} = \\frac{1}{(s-1)(s+2)}\\begin{pmatrix} s+2 & 0 \\\\ 0 & s-1 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{1}{s-1} & 0 \\\\ 0 & \\frac{1}{s+2} \\end{pmatrix}.\n$$\nNow, we compute $G(s)$, noting that $D=0$:\n$$\nG(s) = C(sI - A)^{-1}B = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{1}{s-1} & 0 \\\\ 0 & \\frac{1}{s+2} \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}.\n$$\nPerforming the matrix multiplication:\n$$\nG(s) = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & \\frac{1}{s+2} \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix} = 0 \\cdot 1 + \\left(\\frac{1}{s+2}\\right) \\cdot 1 = \\frac{1}{s+2}.\n$$\nThe transfer function is $G(s) = \\frac{1}{s+2}$. The poles of $G(s)$ are the roots of its denominator, so we solve $s+2=0$, which yields a single pole at $s = -2$. Since the real part of this pole is strictly negative, the system is BIBO-stable.\n\nFinally, we must reconcile the findings: the realization is internally unstable, yet the input-output map is BIBO-stable. This phenomenon is explained by a pole-zero cancellation. The poles of the transfer function are a subset of the eigenvalues of $A$. The eigenvalues of $A$, which are $s=1$ and $s=-2$, are the poles of the *system*. The poles of the *transfer function* are only those system poles that are both controllable and observable.\nLet us examine the full expression for the transfer function, $G(s) = \\frac{C \\cdot \\text{adj}(sI-A) \\cdot B}{\\det(sI-A)}$.\nThe determinant is $\\det(sI-A) = (s-1)(s+2)$. The denominator contains both the stable and the unstable system poles.\nThe numerator is $C \\cdot \\text{adj}(sI-A) \\cdot B$. The adjugate matrix is $\\text{adj}(sI-A) = \\begin{pmatrix} s+2 & 0 \\\\ 0 & s-1 \\end{pmatrix}$.\n$$\nC \\cdot \\text{adj}(sI-A) \\cdot B = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} s+2 & 0 \\\\ 0 & s-1 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & s-1 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix} = s-1.\n$$\nTherefore, the transfer function before simplification is\n$$\nG(s) = \\frac{s-1}{(s-1)(s+2)}.\n$$\nHere, it is evident that there is a zero at $s=1$ which cancels the unstable pole at $s=1$. This cancellation occurs because the unstable mode associated with the eigenvalue $\\lambda_1 = 1$ is unobservable.\nTo verify this, we check the observability of this mode. A mode corresponding to an eigenvalue $\\lambda$ is unobservable if its associated right eigenvector $v$ satisfies $Cv=0$.\nFor $\\lambda_1 = 1$, the right eigenvector $v_1$ is found by solving $(A - \\lambda_1 I)v_1 = 0$:\n$$\n\\begin{pmatrix} 1-1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -2-1 \\end{pmatrix} v_1 = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -3 \\end{pmatrix} v_1 = 0.\n$$\nThis gives $v_1 = k \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}$ for any non-zero scalar $k$. Let's choose $k=1$. We then test for observability:\n$$\nCv_1 = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix} = 0.\n$$\nSince $Cv_1 = 0$, the mode is indeed unobservable. The internal state corresponding to the unstable eigenvalue cannot be seen at the output. Consequently, the instability of this internal mode does not affect the input-output relationship, resulting in a BIBO-stable system despite the internal instability.\n\nThe requested computation is the final expression for the transfer function.

Observability relates to the ability to determine the state of the system from its output. The output equation is given by $y(t) = C x(t) = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} x_1(t) \\\\ x_2(t) \\\\ x_3(t) \\end{pmatrix} = x_1(t)$. The output $y(t)$ is identical to the first state component, $x_1(t)$.\nLet us examine the state equations in component form:\n$$\n\\dot{x}_1(t) = x_2(t)\n$$\n$$\n\\dot{x}_2(t) = -2x_1(t) - 3x_2(t) + u(t)\n$$\n$$\n\\dot{x}_3(t) = x_3(t) + u(t)\n$$\nThe structure of the matrix $A$ is block-diagonal, decoupling the dynamics of $(x_1, x_2)$ from $x_3$. Specifically, the time evolution of $x_1(t)$ and $x_2(t)$ is entirely determined by their own initial conditions, $x_1(0)$ and $x_2(0)$, and the input $u(t)$. The state $x_3(t)$ has absolutely no influence on the dynamics of $x_1(t)$ and $x_2(t)$. Since the output is $y(t)=x_1(t)$, the output is completely independent of the state $x_3(t)$ and its evolution. To demonstrate this conclusively, consider the case where the input is zero, $u(t) = 0$, and the initial conditions are $x_1(0)=0$, $x_2(0)=0$, and $x_3(0) \\neq 0$. The first two state equations yield $x_1(t)=0$ and $x_2(t)=0$ for all $t \\ge 0$, resulting in an output $y(t)=0$ for all time. However, the third state evolves according to $\\dot{x}_3(t) = x_3(t)$, which gives $x_3(t) = x_3(0) \\exp(t)$. This demonstrates that a non-zero, evolving internal state trajectory, specifically that of $x_3(t)$, produces zero output. Therefore, it is impossible to infer the value or behavior of $x_3(t)$ from observing the output $y(t)$. This fulfills the definition of unobservability for the mode associated with $x_3(t)$.\n\nSecond, we explain the internal instability of the realization. Internal stability is determined by the eigenvalues of the state matrix $A$. The eigenvalues are the roots of the characteristic equation $\\det(sI - A) = 0$.\n$$\nsI - A = \\begin{pmatrix}\ns & -1 & 0 \\\\\n2 & s+3 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & s-1\n\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe determinant is computed by cofactor expansion along the third row:\n$$\n\\det(sI-A) = (s-1) \\det \\begin{pmatrix} s & -1 \\\\ 2 & s+3 \\end{pmatrix} = (s-1) [s(s+3) - (-1)(2)] = (s-1)(s^2 + 3s + 2)\n$$\nFactoring the quadratic term gives:\n$$\n\\det(sI-A) = (s-1)(s+1)(s+2)\n$$\nThe eigenvalues of $A$ are the roots of this polynomial, which are $\\lambda_1 = 1$, $\\lambda_2 = -1$, and $\\lambda_3 = -2$. According to the definition of internal stability, all eigenvalues of $A$ must lie strictly in the open left-half of the complex plane, meaning they must all have negative real parts. The eigenvalue $\\lambda_1=1$ has a positive real part, $\\text{Re}\\{\\lambda_1\\} = 1 > 0$. The presence of this single eigenvalue in the right-half plane is sufficient to conclude that the system is internally unstable.\n\nThird, we derive the transfer function $G(s)$ and analyze Bounded-Input Bounded-Output (BIBO) stability. The transfer function for an LTI state-space system is given by the formula $G(s) = C(sI - A)^{-1}B + D$. In this problem, $D=0$.\nWe require the inverse of $(sI-A)$:\n$$\n(sI - A)^{-1} = \\frac{1}{\\det(sI-A)} \\text{adj}(sI-A)\n$$\nThe adjugate matrix, $\\text{adj}(sI-A)$, is the transpose of the cofactor matrix.\n$$\n\\text{adj}(sI - A) = \\begin{pmatrix} (s+3)(s-1) & s-1 & 0 \\\\ -2(s-1) & s(s-1) & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & s^2+3s+2 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nNow we compute the product $C \\cdot \\text{adj}(sI-A) \\cdot B$:\n$$\nC \\cdot \\text{adj}(sI-A) = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} (s+3)(s-1) & s-1 & 0 \\\\ -2(s-1) & s(s-1) & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & s^2+3s+2 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} (s+3)(s-1) & s-1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nNext, we multiply this result by $B$:\n$$\n(C \\cdot \\text{adj}(sI-A)) \\cdot B = \\begin{pmatrix} (s+3)(s-1) & s-1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 1 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix} = (s-1) \\cdot 1 = s-1\n$$\nThe transfer function is therefore:\n$$\nG(s) = \\frac{s-1}{\\det(sI-A)} = \\frac{s-1}{(s-1)(s+1)(s+2)}\n$$\nA pole-zero cancellation occurs at $s=1$. The resulting transfer function is:\n$$\nG(s) = \\frac{1}{(s+1)(s+2)} = \\frac{1}{s^2 + 3s + 2}\n$$\nThe poles of the transfer function $G(s)$ are the roots of its denominator, which are $p_1 = -1$ and $p_2 = -2$. BIBO stability requires all poles of the transfer function to lie strictly in the open left-half plane. Both poles $p_1$ and $p_2$ have strictly negative real parts. Therefore, the input-output system is BIBO stable.\n\nThis result does not contradict the finding of internal instability. Internal stability is a property of the entire state-space realization, while BIBO stability is a property of the input-output mapping described by the transfer function. The transfer function only represents the part of the system dynamics that is both controllable and observable. The unstable eigenvalue at $\\lambda_1 = 1$ corresponds to an internal mode of the system. In the derivation of $G(s)$, the factor $(s-1)$ associated with this unstable mode was cancelled by a zero at the same location. This cancellation is a direct mathematical consequence of the unobservability of the mode, which we established in the first part. The unstable dynamics associated with $x_3(t)$ cannot be seen at the output, so from the perspective of the input-output relationship, the instability is hidden. An input can excite the unstable mode (the mode is controllable since the third element of $B$ is non-zero), causing the state $x_3(t)$ to grow without bound, but this internal instability will never manifest in the output $y(t)$. Thus, a bounded input will still produce a bounded output, consistent with the definition of BIBO stability, even while an internal state variable is diverging.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\frac{1}{s^{2} + 3s + 2}}\n$$", "id": "2739246"}]}
