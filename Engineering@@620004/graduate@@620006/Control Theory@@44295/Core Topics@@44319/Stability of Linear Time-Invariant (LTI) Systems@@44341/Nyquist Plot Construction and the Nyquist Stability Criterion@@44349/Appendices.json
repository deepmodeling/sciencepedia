The number of open-loop poles in the Right-Half-Plane (RHP) is $P=0$. The system has a nonminimum-phase zero at $s=+1$.\n\nTo construct the Nyquist plot, we analyze the behavior of $L(s)$ on the standard Nyquist contour, which is the imaginary axis, $s=j\\omega$ for $\\omega \\in (-\\infty, \\infty)$. We substitute $s=j\\omega$ into $L(s)$ and find its real and imaginary parts.

The full Nyquist plot for $\\omega \\in (-\\infty, \\infty)$ forms a loop that crosses the negative real axis at $-K/2$ and the positive real axis at $K/3$.\nAn encirclement of the point $-1+j0$ occurs if this point lies inside the loop. This requires $-K/2  -1  K/3$. The second inequality is always true for $K>0$. The first inequality, $-K/2  -1$, is equivalent to $K > 2$.\nIf $0  K \\le 2$, then $-1 \\le -K/2  0$, and the point $-1$ is not encircled by the plot. Therefore, the presence of the RHP zero does not force an encirclement for *any* positive $K$; it only happens if $K > 2$.\n\n2) The second question is to find the largest positive gain $K$ for which the closed-loop system is asymptotically stable.\nWe use the Nyquist Stability Criterion, $Z = N + P$, where $N$ is the number of counter-clockwise encirclements of $-1$, $Z$ is the number of unstable closed-loop poles, and $P$ is the number of unstable open-loop poles.\nWe are given $P=0$. For asymptotic stability, we require $Z=0$. The stability condition is thus $N=0$.\n\nWe must determine the range of $K > 0$ for which $N=0$.\n- If $0  K  2$, then $-1  -K/2  0$. The point $-1$ is on the negative real axis but is not enclosed by the Nyquist plot loop. Thus, $N=0$. The system is asymptotically stable.\n- If $K=2$, then $-K/2 = -1$. The Nyquist plot passes directly through the critical point $-1$. This corresponds to a closed-loop pole on the imaginary axis (at $s=0$), meaning the system is marginally stable, not asymptotically stable.\n- If $K > 2$, then $-K/2  -1$. The point $-1$ is enclosed by the loop. To determine $N$, we find the direction of encirclement. For small $\\omega>0$, $\\text{Im}[L(j\\omega)] > 0$, so the plot enters the upper-half plane. The loop is traversed counter-clockwise as $\\omega$ increases from $-\\infty$ to $\\infty$. This means there is one counter-clockwise encirclement, so $N=1$. Applying the Nyquist criterion, $Z = N + P = 1 + 0 = 1$. This indicates one unstable closed-loop pole, so the system is unstable.\n\nThe condition for asymptotic stability is $0  K  2$. The question asks for the \"largest positive gain $K$\" for which this holds. This corresponds to the supremum of the set of stabilizing gains, which is the stability boundary.\nThe largest value of $K$ is therefore $2$.\n\nVerification using the characteristic polynomial $1+L(s)=0$:\n$(s+1)(s+2) + K(s-1) = 0$\n$s^2 + 3s + 2 + Ks - K = 0$\n$s^2 + (3+K)s + (2-K) = 0$\nFor a second-order polynomial with real coefficients to have all its roots in the strict Left-Half-Plane, it is necessary and sufficient that all coefficients are positive.\n1. The coefficient of $s^2$ is $1 > 0$.\n2. The coefficient of $s$ is $3+K > 0$, which implies $K > -3$.\n3. The constant term is $2-K > 0$, which implies $K  2$.\nSince we are given that $K$ is a positive gain ($K>0$), the condition for asymptotic stability is $0  K  2$.
