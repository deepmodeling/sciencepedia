The solution proceeds as follows.\n\nThe problem requires the determination of the phase margin and gain margin of a unity feedback control system from a set of discrete frequency response measurements of its open-loop transfer function, $L(j\\omega)$. The data points are given as pairs of phase in degrees, $\\phi(\\omega)$, and magnitude in decibels, $G_{dB}(\\omega)$. The specified method is linear interpolation on the line segments connecting the given data points in the $(\\phi, G_{dB})$ plane.\n\nFirst, we determine the phase margin. The phase margin, $PM$, is defined in relation to the gain crossover frequency, $\\omega_{gc}$, which is the frequency at which the open-loop magnitude is unity, or $G_{dB}(\\omega_{gc}) = 0\\,\\mathrm{dB}$.

All concepts, including Nichols charts, open-loop and closed-loop transfer functions, phase margin, and resonant peak ($M_{\\mathrm{r}}$), are standard and well-defined in this field. The relationship between these concepts is a fundamental topic in frequency-domain analysis and design.\n2.  **Well-Posed**: The problem is well-posed. It provides sufficient information to deduce a qualitative relationship between the slope of the Nichols plot at crossover and the resonant peak. The conditions—equal phase margin but different slopes—are specific enough to allow for a unique conclusion based on geometric reasoning.\n3.  **Objective**: The problem is stated in precise, objective, and technical language, free from any subjectivity or ambiguity.\n4.  **Completeness and Consistency**: The setup is complete and internally consistent. The scenario of two compensated systems sharing a crossover point but having different local dynamics (represented by the slope) is a practical and plausible situation in controller design.\n5.  **Realism**: The scenario is realistic and relevant to control engineering practice, where designers often trade off performance metrics that are influenced by the shape of the frequency response locus.\n6.  **Triviality**: The problem is not trivial. It requires a non-obvious application of geometric principles related to the Nichols chart. The connection between a local property (slope at one point) and a global property (the maximum of a function over all frequencies) demands careful reasoning.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem statement is valid. It is a standard, well-posed problem in control theory. The solution will now be derived.\n\n### Derivation of Solution\nThe resonant peak, $M_{\\mathrm{r}}$, is defined as the maximum magnitude of the closed-loop frequency response, $M_{\\mathrm{r}} = \\max_{\\omega} |T(j\\omega)|$. Geometrically, on a Nichols chart, this corresponds to the value of the largest $M$-contour that the open-loop locus $L(j\\omega)$ becomes tangent to. The frequency at which this tangency occurs is the resonant frequency, $\\omega_{\\mathrm{r}}$.\n\nThe $M$-contours are closed curves on the Nichols chart. For $M>1$, they encircle the critical point $(-180^\\circ, 0\\,\\mathrm{dB})$. As the value of $M$ increases, the corresponding contour shrinks and becomes closer to this critical point.\n\nWe are given two open-loop loci, $L_1(j\\omega)$ and $L_2(j\\omega)$, that both pass through the same gain crossover point $P_0 = (\\phi_{\\mathrm{gc}}, 0\\,\\mathrm{dB})$. For a stable system with a positive phase margin, we have $\\mathrm{PM} > 0^\\circ$, which implies $\\phi_{\\mathrm{gc}} > -180^\\circ$.\n\nThe slope of the Nichols locus is $S = dy/dx$. For a typical minimum-phase system, as frequency $\\omega$ increases, both the magnitude $|L(j\\omega)|$ and the phase $\\angle L(j\\omega)$ decrease. Thus, $dy/d\\omega < 0$ and $dx/d\\omega < 0$. The slope is $S = \\frac{dy/d\\omega}{dx/d\\omega}$, which is therefore positive. The condition $|S_1| > |S_2|$ thus implies $S_1 > S_2 > 0$. The locus for $L_1$ is indeed steeper than that for $L_2$.\n\nLet us analyze the behavior of the loci in the vicinity of the crossover point $P_0 = (x_0, 0)$, where $x_0 = \\phi_{\\mathrm{gc}}$. The resonant peak typically occurs at a frequency $\\omega_{\\mathrm{r}} < \\omega_{\\mathrm{gc}}$, where the magnitude is greater than unity ($y > 0$). In this region, a lower frequency corresponds to a less negative phase, so $x > x_0$.\n\nUsing a first-order Taylor approximation for the loci near $P_0$:\n- Locus $L_1$: $y_1(x) \\approx S_1 (x - x_0)$\n- Locus $L_2$: $y_2(x) \\approx S_2 (x - x_0)$\n\nConsider a phase value $x$ slightly greater than $x_0$ (i.e., $x-x_0 > 0$), corresponding to the region where resonance may occur ($\\omega < \\omega_{\\mathrm{gc}}$, $y > 0$). Since we established that $S_1 > S_2 > 0$, it follows that for the same phase $x$:\n$$ S_1 (x - x_0) > S_2 (x - x_0) \\implies y_1(x) > y_2(x) $$\nThis means that in the region just before gain crossover (at frequencies $\\omega < \\omega_{\\mathrm{gc}}$), the locus $L_1$ has a higher magnitude in dB than locus $L_2$. Geometrically, the \"hump\" or \"bulge\" of the $L_1$ locus above the $0\\,\\mathrm{dB}$ axis is more pronounced than that of the $L_2$ locus.\n\nThe resonant peak $M_{\\mathrm{r}}$ is determined by how close the locus gets to the critical point $(-180^\\circ, 0\\,\\mathrm{dB})$. A more pronounced bulge means the locus travels higher in magnitude as it approaches the phase values near $-180^\\circ$. This brings the locus spatially closer to the critical point. Because larger values of $M$ correspond to $M$-contours that are closer to the critical point, the $L_1$ locus, which gets closer, will be tangent to an $M$-contour with a higher value of $M$.\n\nTherefore, we conclude that $M_{\\mathrm{r},1} > M_{\\mathrm{r},2}$. The system with the larger magnitude of the Nichols slope at gain crossover will exhibit a higher resonant peak.\n\n### Evaluation of Options\n\n**A. For equal phase margin, the loop with the larger magnitude of Nichols slope at gain crossover has a higher resonant peak $M_{\\mathrm{r}}$, because its locus becomes tangent to a larger $M$-contour; the resonance occurs at such a tangency.**\nThis statement aligns perfectly with the derivation. \"Larger magnitude of Nichols slope\" corresponds to $|S_1|$, which we showed leads to a \"higher resonant peak $M_{\\mathrm{r}}$\". The reasoning provided, that its locus \"becomes tangent to a larger $M$-contour,\" is the correct geometric interpretation for why the peak is higher. This statement is **Correct**.\n\n**B. For equal phase margin, the loop with the smaller magnitude of Nichols slope has the higher resonant peak $M_{\\mathrm{r}}$, because it remains longer near the $-180^\\circ$ phase line and passes closer to the $-1$ point.**\nThis is the opposite of the derived conclusion. The loop with the smaller slope ($L_2$) has a lower resonant peak. The reasoning that a flatter slope means the locus \"remains longer\" is vague and does not correctly translate to geometric proximity. As derived, the flatter locus $L_2$ stays farther from the critical point in the region of resonance. This statement is **Incorrect**.\n\n**C. For equal phase margin, $M_{\\mathrm{r}}$ depends only on the distance from $P_0$ to the point $-1$ in the Nyquist plane, which is the same for both, so $M_{\\mathrm{r}}$ is equal.**\nThis statement incorrectly equates the resonant peak $M_{\\mathrm{r}} = \\max_{\\omega}|T(j\\omega)|$ with the value of $|T(j\\omega)|$ at the specific frequency $\\omega_{\\mathrm{gc}}$. While it is true that $|T(j\\omega_{\\mathrm{gc}})|$ is the same for both systems because PM is the same, the peak value $M_{\\mathrm{r}}$ occurs at the resonant frequency $\\omega_{\\mathrm{r}} \\neq \\omega_{\\mathrm{gc}}$ (in general). The peak value depends on the overall shape of the locus near the critical point, not just on the single crossover point $P_0$. The local slope provides crucial information about this shape, which this option ignores. This statement is **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. The Nichols slope at gain crossover cannot affect $M_{\\mathrm{r}}$ because $M$-contours are orthogonal to vertical phase lines at $P_0$ for any phase margin, so the local direction of the locus is irrelevant to the peak.**\nThe premise of this statement is factually wrong. The $M$-contours have tangents that are horizontal (orthogonal to vertical lines) only on their axis of symmetry, which is the line of phase equal to $-180^\\circ$. The crossover point $P_0$ is at phase $\\phi_{\\mathrm{gc}} \\neq -180^\\circ$ for any system with a non-zero phase margin. At $\\phi_{\\mathrm{gc}}$, the tangent to an $M$-contour is not horizontal. Moreover, the resonant peak is determined by a tangency condition between the entire locus and an $M$-contour, so the local slope is highly relevant as it dictates the shape of the locus entering the critical region.

To express this lag in degrees, we use the conversion factor $\\frac{180^\\circ}{\\pi\\,\\mathrm{rad}}$:\n$$ \\Delta\\phi(\\omega)_{\\text{deg}} = -\\omega T \\frac{180^\\circ}{\\pi} $$\n\nWe can now compute the phase margins at both gain crossover frequencies for the full system $L(s)$.\nThe time delay is $T=0.02\\,\\mathrm{s}$.\n\nAt $\\omega_{gc1} = 5\\,\\mathrm{rad/s}$:\n- Phase of $G(j\\omega_1)$: $\\angle G(j\\omega_1) = -140^\\circ$.\n- Phase lag due to delay: $\\Delta\\phi(5)_{\\text{deg}} = -5 \\cdot (0.02) \\cdot \\frac{180^\\circ}{\\pi} = -0.1 \\cdot \\frac{180^\\circ}{\\pi} \\approx -5.73^\\circ$.\n- Total phase of $L(j\\omega_1)$: $\\angle L(j\\omega_1) = -140^\\circ - 5.73^\\circ = -145.73^\\circ$.\n- Phase margin at $\\omega_{gc1}$: $\\mathrm{PM}_1 = 180^\\circ + \\angle L(j\\omega_1) = 180^\\circ - 145.73^\\circ = 34.27^\\circ$.\n\nAt $\\omega_{gc2} = 40\\,\\mathrm{rad/s}$:\n- Phase of $G(j\\omega_2)$: $\\angle G(j\\omega_2) = -110^\\circ$.\n- Phase lag due to delay: $\\Delta\\phi(40)_{\\text{deg}} = -40 \\cdot (0.02) \\cdot \\frac{180^\\circ}{\\pi} = -0.8 \\cdot \\frac{180^\\circ}{\\pi} \\approx -45.84^\\circ$.\n- Total phase of $L(j\\omega_2)$: $\\angle L(j\\omega_2) = -110^\\circ - 45.84^\\circ = -155.84^\\circ$.\n- Phase margin at $\\omega_{gc2}$: $\\mathrm{PM}_2 = 180^\\circ + \\angle L(j\\omega_2) = 180^\\circ - 155.84^\\circ = 24.16^\\circ$.\n\nThe phase margin is a proxy for stability robustness. The system is stable if the phase is greater than $-180^\\circ$ at all gain crossover frequencies (given $P=0$). The effective phase margin for the system is the smallest of the phase margins, as this represents the point closest to instability. In this case, the effective phase margin is $\\mathrm{min}(\\mathrm{PM}_1, \\mathrm{PM}_2) = \\mathrm{PM}_2 \\approx 24.16^\\circ$.\n\n**Option-by-Option Analysis**\n\n**A. At both gain crossover frequencies, the phase margin decreases by the same absolute amount due to the delay, because the delay does not affect magnitude.**\nThe decrease in phase margin is equal to the magnitude of the phase lag introduced by the delay, which is $\\omega T$. This quantity is dependent on frequency $\\omega$. Since the gain crossover frequencies $\\omega_1 = 5\\,\\mathrm{rad/s}$ and $\\omega_2 = 40\\,\\mathrm{rad/s}$ are distinct, the phase lag contributions are different: $\\omega_1 T = 0.1\\,\\mathrm{rad}$ and $\\omega_2 T = 0.8\\,\\mathrm{rad}$. The decrease in phase margin is not the same. The reasoning \"because the delay does not affect magnitude\" is a correct statement about the delay but it does not support the incorrect conclusion about the phase margin decrease.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**B. When the magnitude crosses unity at multiple frequencies, the effective phase margin is the minimum of the phase margins computed at all the unity-magnitude crossings, because incipient instability occurs when any such crossing coincides with a phase of $-180^\\circ$.**\nThe phase margin indicates the proximity of the open-loop frequency response locus $L(j\\omega)$ to the critical point $(-1, j0)$. Instability is approached as $\\angle L(j\\omega_{gc})$ approaches $-180^\\circ$ for any gain crossover frequency $\\omega_{gc}$. When multiple such frequencies exist, the stability of the closed-loop system is limited by the \"worst-case\" scenario, which is the crossover where the phase is closest to $-180^\\circ$. This corresponds to the smallest positive phase margin. Therefore, the overall stability robustness is correctly characterized by the minimum of all computed phase margins.\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\n**C. Increasing the chosen gain crossover frequency in the presence of a fixed delay $T$ necessarily increases the phase margin read on the Nichols chart.**\nThe phase margin at a gain crossover $\\omega_{gc}$ is $\\mathrm{PM} = 180^\\circ + \\angle G(j\\omega_{gc}) - \\omega_{gc} T \\frac{180^\\circ}{\\pi}$. The term $-\\omega_{gc} T$ decreases linearly as $\\omega_{gc}$ increases. The term $\\angle G(j\\omega_{gc})$ depends on the specific dynamics of $G(s)$ and does not follow a universal rule. In the provided example, as the frequency increases from $\\omega_1=5\\,\\mathrm{rad/s}$ to $\\omega_2=40\\,\\mathrm{rad/s}$, the phase margin decreases from approximately $34.3^\\circ$ to $24.2^\\circ$. This provides a direct counterexample to the claim that the phase margin \"necessarily increases\".\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. With a pure delay, the open-loop locus on the Nichols chart moves to more negative phase by an amount proportional to frequency, which can make a higher-frequency gain crossover become the limiting one for phase margin.**\nThe phase of the total system is $\\angle L(j\\omega) = \\angle G(j\\omega) - \\omega T$. On a Nichols chart, this corresponds to a horizontal shift to the left (more negative phase) by an amount $\\omega T$ relative to the plot of $G(j\\omega)$. This shift is proportional to frequency $\\omega$. Because this phase reduction is more significant at higher frequencies, a gain crossover at a higher frequency can experience a much larger reduction in its phase margin than a crossover at a lower frequency.\nThis is precisely what happens in our example. Without the delay, the phase margins would be $\\mathrm{PM}_1 = 180^\\circ - 140^\\circ = 40^\\circ$ and $\\mathrm{PM}_2 = 180^\\circ - 110^\\circ = 70^\\circ$. The limiting margin is at the lower frequency $\\omega_1$. With the delay, the margins become $\\mathrm{PM}_1 \\approx 34.3^\\circ$ and $\\mathrm{PM}_2 \\approx 24.2^\\circ$. The limiting margin is now at the higher frequency $\\omega_2$. The statement is thus demonstrated to be correct.\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\n**E. If multiple gain crossovers exist, the Nyquist stability criterion depends on the net encirclements of $-1$, so relying on a single phase-margin value can be misleading unless all unity-magnitude crossings are considered.**\nThe Nyquist stability criterion, $Z = N + P$, is the fundamental tool for stability analysis. For a stable open-loop system ($P=0$), stability requires zero net encirclements of the point $(-1, j0)$, i.e., $N=0$. Phase margin is a simplified metric that is fully reliable only for simple systems where the Nyquist plot crosses the unit circle only once. With multiple crossings, the curve can have a complex shape. A positive phase margin at one crossing does not preclude the possibility that the plot later encircles the critical point. To correctly determine $N$, one must examine the behavior of the plot relative to the $-1$ point across all relevant frequencies, which includes all gain crossover points. Relying on a single phase margin can indeed be profoundly misleading and is insufficient to guarantee stability.\nVerdict: **Correct**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{BDE}$$", "id": "2727417"}]}
