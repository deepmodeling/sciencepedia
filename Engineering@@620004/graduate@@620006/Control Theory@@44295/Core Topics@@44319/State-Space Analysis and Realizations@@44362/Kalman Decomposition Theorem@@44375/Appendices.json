The condition that $\\mathcal{R}(A,B)$ contains the image of $B$, denoted $\\text{Im}(B)$, means that for any input vector $u$, the vector $Bu$ must be in $\\mathcal{R}(A,B)$. Since our system has a single input, $\\text{Im}(B)$ is simply the subspace spanned by the single column of $B$.\n\nLet the single column of $B$ be denoted by the vector $b$.\n$$\nb = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nFor $\\mathcal{R}(A,B)$ to contain $\\text{Im}(B)$, the vector $b$ must be in $\\mathcal{R}(A,B)$.\nFor $\\mathcal{R}(A,B)$ to be $A$-invariant, if $b \\in \\mathcal{R}(A,B)$, then $Ab$ must also be in $\\mathcal{R}(A,B)$. By repeated application of this property, $A(Ab) = A^{2}b$ must be in $\\mathcal{R}(A,B)$, and so on. Therefore, any vector of the form $A^{k}b$ for $k \\ge 0$ must belong to $\\mathcal{R}(A,B)$.\nThe subspace spanned by all such vectors, $\\text{span}\\{b, Ab, A^{2}b, \\dots\\}$, is, by construction, $A$-invariant and contains $b$. It is, in fact, the smallest such subspace. By the Cayley-Hamilton theorem, any power of $A$ greater than or equal to the state dimension $n=4$ can be expressed as a linear combination of lower powers $\\{I, A, A^{2}, A^{3}\\}$. Consequently, the generating set for the reachable subspace can be restricted to the first $n$ vectors.\n$$\n\\mathcal{R}(A,B) = \\text{span}\\{B, AB, A^{2}B, A^{3}B\\}\n$$\nThe structural insight from the Kalman decomposition theorem is that the state space can be partitioned into a reachable subspace and its complement. The dimension of this reachable subspace, $\\dim \\mathcal{R}(A,B)$, is found by determining the number of linearly independent vectors in this generating set.
