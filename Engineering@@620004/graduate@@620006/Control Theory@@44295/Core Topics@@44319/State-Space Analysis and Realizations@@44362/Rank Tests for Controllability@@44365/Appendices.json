We will analyze a simple system where the state matrix $A$ is diagonal, meaning its dynamic modes are decoupled. This problem demonstrates vividly how an input can excite one mode while being completely \"blind\" to another, leading to a loss of full state controllability — a phenomenon that both the Kalman and Popov-Belevitch-Hautus (PBH) tests will detect [@problem_id:2735441].", "problem": "Consider the continuous-time linear time-invariant state-space system $\\dot{x}(t) = A x(t) + B u(t)$ with \n$$\nA = \\begin{bmatrix}\n5 & 0 \\\\\n0 & -2\n\\end{bmatrix}, \n\\qquad\nB = \\begin{bmatrix}\n1 \\\\\n0\n\\end{bmatrix}.\n$$\nStarting from the definition of state controllability as the ability to steer the state $x(t)$ from the origin to any state in finite time by a suitably chosen input $u(t)$, use linear algebra and the equivalences that relate this definition to the Kalman controllability rank test and the Popov-Belevitch-Hautus (PBH) test to rigorously determine whether the pair $(A,B)$ is controllable. Explain the mechanism by which controllability fails or holds in this example by identifying the relevant invariant subspaces and how the input $u(t)$ excites (or fails to excite) the system’s eigenmodes.\n\nFinally, compute the rank of the controllability matrix $\\mathcal{C}(A,B)$ for this system. Report only this rank as your final answer. No rounding is required and no units are involved.", "solution": "The problem as stated is valid. It is a well-posed, scientifically grounded problem from the field of linear control theory. All necessary data are provided, and the terms are unambiguous. I will proceed with the analysis.\n\nThe system under consideration is the continuous-time linear time-invariant (LTI) system described by the state-space equation $\\dot{x}(t) = Ax(t) + Bu(t)$, where the state is $x(t) \\in \\mathbb{R}^2$ and the input is $u(t) \\in \\mathbb{R}$. The system matrices are given as:\n$$\nA = \\begin{bmatrix} 5 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -2 \\end{bmatrix}, \\qquad B = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{bmatrix}\n$$\nState controllability is fundamentally about the ability to steer the system state from an initial state, typically the origin $x(0)=0$, to any arbitrary final state $x_f \\in \\mathbb{R}^n$ in a finite time $t_f > 0$. The set of all states reachable from the origin is known as the reachable subspace. A system is controllable if and only if its reachable subspace is the entire state space, $\\mathbb{R}^n$. For this system, the state dimension is $n=2$.\n\nThe solution to the state equation with initial condition $x(0) = 0$ is given by the variation of constants formula:\n$$\nx(t_f) = \\int_{0}^{t_f} e^{A(t_f - \\tau)} B u(\\tau) d\\tau\n$$\nThe reachable subspace is the image of this integral operator, which corresponds to the column space of the controllability matrix.\n\nFirst, we apply the Kalman controllability rank test. The controllability matrix for a system of dimension $n$ is defined as $\\mathcal{C}(A,B) = \\begin{bmatrix} B & AB & A^2B & \\cdots & A^{n-1}B \\end{bmatrix}$. A system is controllable if and only if $\\mathrm{rank}(\\mathcal{C}(A,B)) = n$.\nFor this system, $n=2$, so we must construct and evaluate the rank of $\\mathcal{C}(A,B) = \\begin{bmatrix} B & AB \\end{bmatrix}$.\n\nWe calculate the product $AB$:\n$$\nAB = \\begin{bmatrix} 5 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -2 \\end{bmatrix} \\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} 5 \\\\ 0 \\end{bmatrix}\n$$\nThe controllability matrix is therefore:\n$$\n\\mathcal{C}(A,B) = \\begin{bmatrix} B & AB \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 5 \\\\ 0 & 0 \\end{bmatrix}\n$$\nThe rank of a matrix is the number of linearly independent columns (or rows). The two columns of $\\mathcal{C}(A,B)$ are $\\begin{bmatrix}1 \\\\ 0\\end{bmatrix}$ and $\\begin{bmatrix}5 \\\\ 0\\end{bmatrix}$. The second column is simply $5$ times the first column, so they are linearly dependent. The matrix has only one linearly independent column. Thus, its rank is $1$.\nSince $\\mathrm{rank}(\\mathcal{C}(A,B)) = 1$, which is less than the state dimension $n=2$, the Kalman test concludes that the system is **not controllable**.\n\nThe physical mechanism for this lack of controllability becomes clear when analyzing the system's eigenstructure. The system matrix $A$ is diagonal, so its eigenvalues are the diagonal entries: $\\lambda_1 = 5$ and $\\lambda_2 = -2$. The corresponding eigenvectors are the standard basis vectors: $v_1 = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{bmatrix}$ and $v_2 = \\begin{bmatrix} 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{bmatrix}$.\nThe state vector $x(t) = \\begin{bmatrix} x_1(t) \\\\ x_2(t) \\end{bmatrix}$ can be viewed as a linear combination of these eigenvectors. The state equations are decoupled:\n$$\n\\dot{x}_1(t) = 5 x_1(t) + 1 \\cdot u(t)\n$$\n$$\n\\dot{x}_2(t) = -2 x_2(t) + 0 \\cdot u(t)\n$$\nThe input $u(t)$ directly influences the dynamics of the first state variable, $x_1(t)$, which corresponds to the mode associated with the eigenvalue $\\lambda_1 = 5$. However, the input has no effect on the dynamics of the second state variable, $x_2(t)$. The evolution of $x_2(t)$ is governed solely by $\\dot{x}_2(t) = -2x_2(t)$, which is an autonomous equation. If the system starts at $x(0) = 0$, then $x_2(0)=0$, and $x_2(t)$ will remain zero for all time, regardless of the control input $u(t)$. It is impossible to steer the state to any target where the second component is non-zero. The reachable subspace is the span of the columns of $\\mathcal{C}(A,B)$, which is $\\mathrm{span}\\left\\{\\begin{bmatrix}1 \\\\ 0\\end{bmatrix}\\right\\}$. This is the eigenspace corresponding to the controllable mode $\\lambda_1 = 5$. The uncontrollable subspace is the eigenspace corresponding to the uncontrollable mode $\\lambda_2 = -2$.\n\nThis result is confirmed by the Popov-Belevitch-Hautus (PBH) test. The PBH test states that the pair $(A,B)$ is controllable if and only if the matrix $\\begin{bmatrix} A - \\lambda I & B \\end{bmatrix}$ has full row rank (i.e., rank $n$) for every eigenvalue $\\lambda$ of $A$.\n\nFor $\\lambda_1 = 5$:\n$$\n\\begin{bmatrix} A - 5I & B \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} 5-5 & 0 & 1 \\\\ 0 & -2-5 & 0 \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} 0 & 0 & 1 \\\\ 0 & -7 & 0 \\end{bmatrix}\n$$\nThis matrix has two linearly independent rows, so its rank is $2$. The test passes for this eigenvalue.\n\nFor $\\lambda_2 = -2$:\n$$\n\\begin{bmatrix} A - (-2)I & B \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} 5+2 & 0 & 1 \\\\ 0 & -2+2 & 0 \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} 7 & 0 & 1 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\end{bmatrix}\n$$\nThis matrix has a zero row, so its rank is $1$, which is less than $n=2$. Because the test fails for at least one eigenvalue, the system is not controllable. The failure for $\\lambda_2 = -2$ demonstrates that the mode associated with this eigenvalue is uncontrollable. This is because there exists a left eigenvector of $A$ corresponding to $\\lambda_2$, namely $w_2^T = \\begin{bmatrix}0 & 1\\end{bmatrix}$, which is orthogonal to the input matrix $B$: $w_2^T B = \\begin{bmatrix}0 & 1\\end{bmatrix}\\begin{bmatrix}1 \\\\ 0\\end{bmatrix} = 0$. This orthogonality is the signature of an uncontrollable mode.\n\nThe final request is to compute the rank of the controllability matrix $\\mathcal{C}(A,B)$. As calculated above,\n$$\n\\mathcal{C}(A,B) = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 5 \\\\ 0 & 0 \\end{bmatrix}\n$$\nThe rank of this matrix is $1$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{1}$$", "id": "2735441"}, {"introduction": "Building on the decoupled case, this practice explores a system where the states are coupled, as indicated by a non-diagonal state matrix $A$.

These are standard, well-established topics.\n- **Well-Posedness**: The problem is well-posed.

It is a standard exercise in assessing the controllability of a linear system. Proceeding to solution.\n\nThe solution will be executed in three parts as requested.\n\nFirst, we are given the system matrices:\n$$\nA = \\begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 & 2 \\\\ 0 & -1 & 3 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 4 \\end{bmatrix}, \\quad B = \\begin{bmatrix} 0 \\\\ 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{bmatrix}\n$$\n\nSecond, we verify the rank of the Kalman controllability matrix, $\\mathcal{C}$. The definition is $\\mathcal{C} = [B, AB, A^2B]$. We must compute the columns of this matrix.\nThe first column is $B$ itself.\nThe second column is $AB$:\n$$\nAB = \\begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 & 2 \\\\ 0 & -1 & 3 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 4 \\end{bmatrix} \\begin{bmatrix} 0 \\\\ 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} (0)(0) + (1)(1) + (2)(0) \\\\ (0)(0) + (-1)(1) + (3)(0) \\\\ (0)(0) + (0)(1) + (4)(0) \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\\\ -1 \\\\ 0 \\end{bmatrix}\n$$\nThe third column is $A^2B$, which is $A(AB)$:\n$$\nA(AB) = \\begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 & 2 \\\\ 0 & -1 & 3 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 4 \\end{bmatrix} \\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\\\ -1 \\\\ 0 \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} (0)(1) + (1)(-1) + (2)(0) \\\\ (0)(1) + (-1)(-1) + (3)(0) \\\\ (0)(1) + (0)(-1) + (4)(0) \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} -1 \\\\ 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{bmatrix}\n$$\nNow, we construct the controllability matrix $\\mathcal{C}$:\n$$\n\\mathcal{C} = \\begin{bmatrix} B & AB & A^2B \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 & -1 \\\\ 1 & -1 & 1 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\end{bmatrix}\n$$\nTo find the rank of $\\mathcal{C}$, we observe its structure. The third row consists entirely of zeros, so the rank must be less than $3$. The third column is the negative of the second column, indicating linear dependence among the columns. However, the first two columns, $\\begin{bmatrix} 0 \\\\ 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{bmatrix}$ and $\\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\\\ -1 \\\\ 0 \\end{bmatrix}$, are linearly independent. Therefore, the dimension of the column space is $2$.\n$$\n\\operatorname{rank}(\\mathcal{C}) = 2\n$$\nThis confirms that the rank of the controllability matrix is $2$. Since the rank ($2$) is less than the state dimension ($n=3$), the system is uncontrollable.\n\nThird, we use the Popov-Belevitch-Hautus (PBH) test to identify the uncontrollable mode. The PBH test states that the pair $(A, B)$ is uncontrollable if and only if $\\operatorname{rank}([A - \\lambda I | B]) < n$ for some eigenvalue $\\lambda$ of $A$. An eigenvalue for which this condition holds corresponds to an uncontrollable mode.\n\nThe state matrix $A$ is upper triangular. Its eigenvalues are its diagonal entries.\nThe eigenvalues of $A$ are $\\lambda_1 = 0$, $\\lambda_2 = -1$, and $\\lambda_3 = 4$. We must test the rank condition for each eigenvalue. The state dimension is $n=3$.\n\nCase 1: $\\lambda = 0$\n$$\n[A - 0I | B] = [A | B] = \\begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 & 2 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 & 3 & 1 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 4 & 0 \\end{bmatrix}\n$$\nThis is a $3 \\times 4$ matrix already in row echelon form. It has $3$ non-zero rows, so its rank is $3$. Since $\\operatorname{rank}([A - 0I | B]) = 3 = n$, the mode corresponding to $\\lambda=0$ is controllable.\n\nCase 2: $\\lambda = -1$\n$$\n[A - (-1)I | B] = [A + I | B] = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 1 & 2 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 3 & 1 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 5 & 0 \\end{bmatrix}\n$$\nThe first row has a leading $1$ in the first column. The second and third rows are clearly linearly independent as neither is a multiple of the other. The first row is also linearly independent from the span of the other two. Thus, there are $3$ linearly independent rows, and the rank is $3$. Since $\\operatorname{rank}([A - (-1)I | B]) = 3 = n$, the mode corresponding to $\\lambda=-1$ is controllable.\n\nCase 3: $\\lambda = 4$\n$$\n[A - 4I | B] = \\begin{bmatrix} 0-4 & 1 & 2 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1-4 & 3 & 1 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 4-4 & 0 \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} -4 & 1 & 2 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -5 & 3 & 1 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\end{bmatrix}\n$$\nThis matrix has a row of all zeros. Its rank is therefore strictly less than $3$. The first two rows are linearly independent. Thus, the rank is exactly $2$.\n$$\n\\operatorname{rank}([A - 4I | B]) = 2 < 3\n$$\nThe PBH condition fails for $\\lambda=4$. This confirms that the mode associated with the eigenvalue $\\lambda=4$ is uncontrollable.\n\nTo provide further justification from eigenstructure, a mode $\\lambda$ is uncontrollable if and only if there exists a left eigenvector $v$ of $A$ corresponding to $\\lambda$ such that $v^T B = 0$. We seek a non-zero vector $v$ such that $v^T A = \\lambda v^T$ and $v^T B = 0$. This is equivalent to finding a right eigenvector of $A^T$ for eigenvalue $\\lambda$ that is orthogonal to $B$.\nLet us find the left eigenvector for $\\lambda=4$. We solve $(A^T - 4I)v = 0$:\n$$\nA^T = \\begin{bmatrix} 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 1 & -1 & 0 \\\\ 2 & 3 & 4 \\end{bmatrix}\n$$\n$$\n(A^T - 4I)v = \\begin{bmatrix} -4 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 1 & -5 & 0 \\\\ 2 & 3 & 0 \\end{bmatrix} \\begin{bmatrix} v_1 \\\\ v_2 \\\\ v_3 \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\end{bmatrix}\n$$\nThis system yields $-4v_1 = 0 \\implies v_1 = 0$. Substituting into the second equation, $0 - 5v_2 = 0 \\implies v_2 = 0$. The variable $v_3$ is a free variable. A valid left eigenvector is $v = [0, 0, 1]^T$.\nNow, we test the orthogonality condition $v^T B = 0$:\n$$\nv^T B = \\begin{bmatrix} 0 & 0 & 1 \\end{bmatrix} \\begin{bmatrix} 0 \\\\ 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{bmatrix} = (0)(0) + (0)(1) + (1)(0) = 0\n$$\nThe condition is satisfied. The existence of such a left eigenvector for $\\lambda=4$ provides rigorous confirmation that this eigenvalue corresponds to the uncontrollable mode of the system.\n\nThe uncontrollable eigenvalue is conclusively identified as $4$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{4}\n$$", "id": "2735434"}, {"introduction": "This final, advanced exercise tackles the subtleties of controllability for systems with repeated eigenvalues, which give rise to Jordan block structures in the state matrix $A$.
