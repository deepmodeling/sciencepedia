The problem requires the construction of a controllable companion form realization, a proof of its minimality, a justification for the existence of a balanced realization, and the computation of the determinant of the state matrix $A$. The problem is scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and contains sufficient information for a unique solution. Therefore, it is deemed valid, and we proceed with the solution.\n\nThe order of the numerator and denominator polynomials are equal, both being $3$. This means the transfer function is proper, but not strictly proper. To find a state-space realization, we must first separate the transfer function into a constant term $D$ and a strictly proper part $G_{sp}(s)$ using polynomial long division.\n$$\nG(s) = D + G_{sp}(s) = D + \\frac{N_r(s)}{P(s)}\n$$\nwhere $P(s) = s^{3} + 4 s^{2} + 5 s + 2$ is the denominator polynomial. The constant $D$ is the ratio of the leading coefficients of the numerator and the denominator.\n$$\nD = \\frac{2}{1} = 2\n$$\nThe remainder polynomial $N_r(s)$ is found by subtracting $D \\cdot P(s)$ from the original numerator.\n$$\nN_r(s) = (2 s^{3} + 3 s^{2} + 7 s + 5) - 2(s^{3} + 4 s^{2} + 5 s + 2)\n$$\n$$\nN_r(s) = (2 s^{3} + 3 s^{2} + 7 s + 5) - (2s^{3} + 8 s^{2} + 10 s + 4)\n$$\n$$\nN_r(s) = -5 s^{2} - 3 s + 1\n$$\nThus, the transfer function is decomposed as:\n$$\nG(s) = 2 + \\frac{-5 s^{2} - 3 s + 1}{s^{3} + 4 s^{2} + 5 s + 2}\n$$\nNow, we construct the controllable companion form realization for the strictly proper part $G_{sp}(s)$. Let the denominator be $P(s) = s^3 + a_2 s^2 + a_1 s + a_0$ and the numerator of the strictly proper part be $N_r(s) = b_2 s^2 + b_1 s + b_0$. By comparison, we have:\n$a_2 = 4$, $a_1 = 5$, $a_0 = 2$.\n$b_2 = -5$, $b_1 = -3$, $b_0 = 1$.\n\nThe controllable companion form matrices $(A, B, C)$ for a third-order system are defined as:\n$$\nA = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 1 \\\\ -a_0 & -a_1 & -a_2 \\end{pmatrix}, \\quad B = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}, \\quad C = \\begin{pmatrix} b_0 & b_1 & b_2 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nSubstituting the coefficients, we obtain the realization:\n$$\nA = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 1 \\\\ -2 & -5 & -4 \\end{pmatrix}, \\quad B = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}, \\quad C = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & -3 & -5 \\end{pmatrix}, \\quad D = 2\n$$\n\nNext, we verify the minimality of this realization.

Since $\\det(\\mathcal{C}) \\neq 0$, the matrix has full rank ($3$), and the system is controllable. This is expected, as we constructed the realization in controllable companion form.\n\nTo verify observability, we form the observability matrix $\\mathcal{O}$ and check its rank.\n$$\n\\mathcal{O} = \\begin{pmatrix} C \\\\ CA \\\\ CA^2 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nWe compute the rows:\n$C = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & -3 & -5 \\end{pmatrix}$\n$CA = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & -3 & -5 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 1 \\\\ -2 & -5 & -4 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 10 & 1+25 & -3+20 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 10 & 26 & 17 \\end{pmatrix}$\n$CA^2 = (CA)A = \\begin{pmatrix} 10 & 26 & 17 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 1 \\\\ -2 & -5 & -4 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} -34 & 10-85 & 26-68 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} -34 & -75 & -42 \\end{pmatrix}$\nThe observability matrix is:\n$$\n\\mathcal{O} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & -3 & -5 \\\\ 10 & 26 & 17 \\\\ -34 & -75 & -42 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nIts determinant is:\n$\\det(\\mathcal{O}) = 1(26(-42) - 17(-75)) - (-3)(10(-42) - 17(-34)) - 5(10(-75) - 26(-34))$\n$\\det(\\mathcal{O}) = 1(-1092 + 1275) + 3(-420 + 578) - 5(-750 + 884)$\n$\\det(\\mathcal{O}) = 1(183) + 3(158) - 5(134) = 183 + 474 - 670 = -13$.\nSince $\\det(\\mathcal{O}) \\neq 0$, the matrix has full rank ($3$), and the system is observable. Because the realization is both controllable and observable, it is minimal. This implies there are no pole-zero cancellations in the original transfer function $G(s)$.\n\nA balanced realization exists for any linear time-invariant system that is both minimal (controllable and observable) and stable. We have established minimality. We now check stability. The system's poles are the eigenvalues of the state matrix $A$, which are the roots of the characteristic equation $\\det(sI - A) = 0$. By construction, this is the denominator polynomial $P(s) = s^{3} + 4 s^{2} + 5 s + 2 = 0$. We can find the roots by testing integer factors of the constant term $2$.\nFor $s=-1$: $(-1)^3 + 4(-1)^2 + 5(-1) + 2 = -1 + 4 - 5 + 2 = 0$.\nFor $s=-2$: $(-2)^3 + 4(-2)^2 + 5(-2) + 2 = -8 + 16 - 10 + 2 = 0$.\nFactoring out $(s+1)(s+2) = s^2+3s+2$, we find $P(s) = (s^2+3s+2)(s+1) = (s+1)^2(s+2)$.\nThe eigenvalues (poles) are $\\lambda_1 = -1$ (with algebraic multiplicity $2$) and $\\lambda_2 = -2$. Since all eigenvalues have strictly negative real parts, the system is asymptotically stable. As the system is minimal and stable, the controllability and observability Gramians exist, are positive definite, and a balancing transformation can be found. Thus, a balanced realization exists.\n\nFinally, we compute the determinant of the state matrix $A$.\n$$\nA = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 1 \\\\ -2 & -5 & -4 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nUsing cofactor expansion along the first row:\n$$\n\\det(A) = 0 \\cdot \\det\\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ -5 & -4 \\end{pmatrix} - 1 \\cdot \\det\\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ -2 & -4 \\end{pmatrix} + 0 \\cdot \\det\\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 \\\\ -2 & -5 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\n$$\n\\det(A) = -1 \\cdot ((0)(-4) - (1)(-2)) = -1 \\cdot (0 - (-2)) = -1 \\cdot (2) = -2\n$$\nAlternatively, the determinant of a companion matrix of this form is given by $(-1)^{n} a_0$. For $n=3$, $\\det(A) = (-1)^3 (2) = -2$.\n$\\det(sI-A) = s^3+4s^2+5s+2$.\nAt $s=0$, $\\det(-A) = 2$.\nFor $n=3$, $\\det(-A) = (-1)^3 \\det(A) = -\\det(A)$.\nSo, $-\\det(A) = 2$, which gives $\\det(A) = -2$.

The dimension of the realization is the dimension $n$ of the state vector, which corresponds to the size of the square matrix $A$ (i.e., $A \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n \\times n}$). The term $D$ is a scalar for a SISO system, which is zero if the transfer function is strictly proper.\n\nA realization is termed minimal if its dimension $n$ is the smallest possible among all valid state-space realizations of the given $G(s)$. The McMillan degree of a transfer function $G(s)$ is, by definition, the dimension of its minimal realization.\n\nA cornerstone theorem in linear systems theory establishes that a realization $(A, B, C, D)$ is minimal if and only if the pair $(A,B)$ is controllable and the pair $(A,C)$ is observable. The transfer function derived from a state-space model is given by $G(s) = C \\frac{\\text{adj}(sI - A)}{\\det(sI - A)} B + D$. The polynomial $\\det(sI-A)$ is the characteristic polynomial of the matrix $A$, and its roots are the poles of the system. The degree of this polynomial is $n$, the dimension of the state space.\n\nIf the system is not minimal (i.e., it possesses either uncontrollable or unobservable modes), these modes manifest as common factors between the numerator and denominator of the transfer function expression. Specifically, a pole located at $s = \\lambda$ that is canceled by a zero at the same location corresponds to a mode of the system associated with the eigenvalue $\\lambda$ that is either not influenced by the input (uncontrollable) or does not affect the output (unobservable).\n\nConsequently, the transfer function of a minimal realization is one where the numerator and denominator polynomials are coprime, meaning they share no common roots.

The denominator of this transfer function, before any cancellations, is $\\det(sI-A)$, a polynomial of degree $k$. After potential cancellations of uncontrollable or unobservable modes, the degree of the denominator of the resulting reduced transfer function will be less than or equal to $k$. For this realization to be valid, its reduced transfer function must be identical to $G_{red}(s)$. As the denominator of $G_{red}(s)$ has degree $8$, it is required that $k \\ge 8$.

Since $\\text{rank}(\\mathcal{C}) < n = 4$, the system is not completely controllable. The states that are not reachable form the unreachable subspace, $\\mathcal{S}_{ur}$, which is the orthogonal complement of the controllable subspace $\\mathcal{S}_c = \\mathcal{R}(\\mathcal{C})$. The unreachable subspace is equivalent to the nullspace of the transpose of the controllability matrix, $\\mathcal{S}_{ur} = \\mathcal{N}(\\mathcal{C}^{\\top})$.

The dimension of the unreachable subspace is $2$. This subspace corresponds to the third and fourth components of the state vector, which cannot be influenced by the input $u(t)$.\n\nSecond, we analyze the observability of the system. The unobservable subspace, $\\mathcal{S}_{uo}$, is the set of initial states that produce zero output for all time with zero input.

The dimension of the unobservable subspace is $2$. This indicates that the third and fourth components of the state vector have no effect on the output $y(t)$.\n\nThe system is neither controllable nor observable, and therefore the realization is not minimal. The order of a minimal realization, $n_{\\min}$, is the dimension of the subspace of states that are both controllable and observable. This is given by the dimension of the intersection of the controllable subspace $\\mathcal{S}_c$ and the observable subspace $\\mathcal{S}_o$.\nFrom our analysis:\nThe controllable subspace is the range of $\\mathcal{C}$: $\\mathcal{S}_c = \\mathcal{R}(\\mathcal{C}) = \\text{span}\\{[0,1,0,0]^{\\top}, [1,0,0,0]^{\\top}\\} = \\text{span}\\{e_1, e_2\\}$.\nThe observable subspace $\\mathcal{S}_o$ is the orthogonal complement of the unobservable subspace $\\mathcal{S}_{uo}$.\n$\\mathcal{S}_{uo} = \\mathcal{N}(\\mathcal{O}) = \\text{span}\\{[0,0,1,0]^{\\top}, [0,0,0,1]^{\\top}\\} = \\text{span}\\{e_3, e_4\\}$.\nTherefore, $\\mathcal{S}_o = (\\mathcal{S}_{uo})^\\perp = (\\text{span}\\{e_3, e_4\\})^\\perp = \\text{span}\\{e_1, e_2\\}$.\nThe intersection is $\\mathcal{S}_{co} = \\mathcal{S}_c \\cap \\mathcal{S}_o = \\text{span}\\{e_1, e_2\\} \\cap \\text{span}\\{e_1, e_2\\} = \\text{span}\\{e_1, e_2\\}$.\nThe dimension of this subspace is $n_{\\min} = \\dim(\\mathcal{S}_{co}) = 2$.\nThe minimal realization of this system has order $2$. This corresponds to the subsystem $(A_{11}, B_1, C_1)$ associated with states $x_1$ and $x_2$, which is both controllable and observable. The dynamics of states $x_3$ and $x_4$ are both unreachable from the input and unobservable from the output.\nThe order of the minimal realization is $n_{\\min} = 2$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{2}$$", "id": "2724291"}]}
