It is a well-posed, self-contained, and scientifically sound problem in the field of linear control theory. All necessary data and definitions are provided, and no contradictions or ambiguities are present. We shall proceed with the analysis.\n\nThe system under consideration is a linear time-invariant (LTI) system described by the state equation $\\dot{x}(t) = A x(t) + B u(t)$, where the state vector $x(t) \\in \\mathbb{R}^n$. The given matrices are:\n$$\nA = \\begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 0 & 0 \\end{bmatrix}, \\quad B = \\begin{bmatrix} 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{bmatrix}\n$$\nThe dimension of the state space is $n=2$. We will address each part of the problem systematically.\n\nFirst, we construct the controllability matrix, denoted by $\\mathcal{C}$. By definition, for a system of dimension $n$, the controllability matrix is formed by concatenating the vectors $B, AB, A^2B, \\dots, A^{n-1}B$. In this case, $n=2$, so we must compute $\\mathcal{C} = \\begin{bmatrix} B & AB \\end{bmatrix}$.\n\nThe first column is the matrix $B$ itself:\n$$\nB = \\begin{bmatrix} 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{bmatrix}\n$$\nThe second column is the product $AB$:\n$$\nAB = \\begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 0 & 0 \\end{bmatrix} \\begin{bmatrix} 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} (0)(0) + (1)(1) \\\\ (0)(0) + (0)(1) \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{bmatrix}\n$$\nCombining these columns, we construct the controllability matrix $\\mathcal{C}$:\n$$\n\\mathcal{C} = \\begin{bmatrix} B & AB \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{bmatrix}\n$$\n\nNext, we determine the controllable subspace, also known as the reachable subspace, $\\mathcal{R}(A,B)$. This subspace is defined as the image of the controllability matrix, which is equivalent to the span of its column vectors. The columns of $\\mathcal{C}$ are the vectors $v_1 = \\begin{bmatrix} 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{bmatrix}$ and $v_2 = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{bmatrix}$. These are the standard basis vectors for the two-dimensional Euclidean space $\\mathbb{R}^2$. These vectors are, by inspection, linearly independent. The subspace spanned by two linearly independent vectors in $\\mathbb{R}^2$ is the entire space $\\mathbb{R}^2$. Therefore, the controllable subspace is:\n$$\n\\mathcal{R}(A,B) = \\text{span}\\left\\{ \\begin{bmatrix} 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{bmatrix}, \\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{bmatrix} \\right\\} = \\mathbb{R}^2\n$$\nThe dimension of this subspace, denoted by $d$, is the number of vectors in its basis, which is $2$. Thus, $d = \\dim(\\mathcal{R}(A,B)) = 2$.\n\nNow, we evaluate the controllability of the pair $(A,B)$. The Kalman rank condition for controllability states that the system is fully controllable if and only if the rank of the controllability matrix $\\mathcal{C}$ is equal to the dimension of the state space, $n$. Here, $n=2$. We calculate the rank of $\\mathcal{C}$:\n$$\n\\text{rank}(\\mathcal{C}) = \\text{rank}\\left( \\begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{bmatrix} \\right)\n$$\nThe determinant of this matrix is $\\det(\\mathcal{C}) = (0)(0) - (1)(1) = -1$. Since $\\det(\\mathcal{C}) \\neq 0$, the matrix is non-singular and has full rank. The rank is $2$. Since $\\text{rank}(\\mathcal{C}) = 2 = n$, the system is completely controllable.\n\nAlternatively, we may use the Hautus test (also known as the Popov-Belevitch-Hautus test). This test asserts that the pair $(A,B)$ is controllable if and only if the matrix $\\begin{bmatrix} \\lambda I - A & B \\end{bmatrix}$ has full row rank (i.e., rank $n$) for all complex numbers $\\lambda$. It is sufficient to check this condition for the eigenvalues of $A$. We find the eigenvalues of $A$ from the characteristic equation $\\det(\\lambda I - A) = 0$:\n$$\n\\det\\left( \\begin{bmatrix} \\lambda & -1 \\\\ 0 & \\lambda \\end{bmatrix} \\right) = \\lambda^2 = 0\n$$\nThe matrix $A$ has a repeated eigenvalue at $\\lambda = 0$. We must check the Hautus condition for this eigenvalue:\n$$\n\\text{rank}\\left( \\begin{bmatrix} 0 \\cdot I - A & B \\end{bmatrix} \\right) = \\text{rank}\\left( \\begin{bmatrix} -A & B \\end{bmatrix} \\right) = \\text{rank}\\left( \\begin{bmatrix} 0 & -1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 1 \\end{bmatrix} \\right)\n$$\nThe resulting matrix is already in row echelon form. It has two non-zero rows, so its rank is $2$. Since this rank is equal to the state dimension $n=2$, the Hautus test confirms that the system is controllable.\n\nFinally, we address stabilizability. A system is defined as stabilizable if all its unstable modes are controllable. An unstable mode corresponds to an eigenvalue $\\lambda$ of $A$ with a non-negative real part, $\\text{Re}(\\lambda) \\ge 0$. In our case, the eigenvalues are $\\lambda_1 = \\lambda_2 = 0$, both of which are on the imaginary axis and are thus considered unstable modes. Since we have proven that the system is completely controllable, it implies that all modes, including the unstable ones, are controllable. Therefore, the system is stabilizable. It is a fundamental result in control theory that any controllable system is also stabilizable.\n\nThe question requires the dimension $d$ of the controllable subspace $\\mathcal{R}(A,B)$. As demonstrated, $\\mathcal{R}(A,B) = \\mathbb{R}^2$, and its dimension is $2$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{2}$$", "id": "2697459"}, {"introduction": "Not all systems are fully controllable, which raises a critical practical question: which parts of the system can we influence?

The controllable subspace, denoted $\\mathcal{R}(A,B)$, is the image of the controllability matrix $\\mathcal{C}$. For a system of dimension $n=2$, the controllability matrix is defined as\n$$\n\\mathcal{C} = \\begin{bmatrix} B & AB \\end{bmatrix}\n$$\nWe compute the product $AB$:\n$$\nAB = \\begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 0 & 0 \\end{bmatrix} \\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} 0 \\\\ 0 \\end{bmatrix}\n$$\nThus, the controllability matrix is\n$$\n\\mathcal{C} = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 \\end{bmatrix}\n$$\nThe rank of $\\mathcal{C}$ is $\\text{rank}(\\mathcal{C}) = 1$. Since the rank is less than the dimension of the state space ($1 < 2$), the system is not completely controllable. The controllable subspace $\\mathcal{R}(A,B)$ is the vector space spanned by the columns of $\\mathcal{C}$. From the structure of $\\mathcal{C}$, this subspace is\n$$\n\\mathcal{R}(A,B) = \\text{span}\\left\\{\\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{bmatrix}\\right\\}\n$$\nThis means that control can only influence the first state variable, $x_1$.\n\nNext, we analyze the closed-loop system dynamics. The closed-loop state matrix $A_{cl}$ is given by $A_{cl} = A + BK$. Substituting the given matrices, we have\n$$\nA_{cl} = \\begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 0 & 0 \\end{bmatrix} + \\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{bmatrix} \\begin{bmatrix} k_{1} & k_{2} \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 0 & 0 \\end{bmatrix} + \\begin{bmatrix} k_{1} & k_{2} \\\\ 0 & 0 \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} k_{1} & 1+k_{2} \\\\ 0 & 0 \\end{bmatrix}\n$$\nThe eigenvalues of the closed-loop system are the roots of the characteristic equation $\\det(\\lambda I - A_{cl}) = 0$.\n$$\n\\det\\left( \\begin{bmatrix} \\lambda - k_{1} & -(1+k_{2}) \\\\ 0 & \\lambda - 0 \\end{bmatrix} \\right) = (\\lambda - k_{1})\\lambda = 0\n$$\nThe eigenvalues of the closed-loop system are $\\lambda_{1} = k_{1}$ and $\\lambda_{2} = 0$.\n\nBy the Pole Placement Theorem, state feedback can only be used to arbitrarily assign the eigenvalues associated with the controllable part of the system. The eigenvalues of the uncontrollable part remain fixed. The system is already in a form that separates the controllable and uncontrollable modes. The eigenvalue $\\lambda_{1} = k_{1}$ is the controllable eigenvalue, as its value depends on the feedback gain $k_{1}$, which acts through the input matrix $B$ on the controllable subspace. The eigenvalue $\\lambda_{2} = 0$ is the uncontrollable eigenvalue; its value is independent of the choice of feedback gains $k_{1}$ and $k_{2}$.\n\nThe problem requires us to place the controllable closed-loop eigenvalue at $-1$. Therefore, we must set\n$$\n\\lambda_{1} = k_{1} = -1\n$$\nThe value of $k_{2}$ does not affect the system's eigenvalues, only the eigenvectors and the coupling between the states. It can be chosen arbitrarily, for instance, $k_{2}=0$, but its value is not requested.\n\nFinally, we discuss the remaining eigenvalue and its relation to stabilizability. The remaining eigenvalue is the uncontrollable one, $\\lambda_{2} = 0$. This eigenvalue cannot be moved by any state feedback of the form $u=Kx$. A system $(A, B)$ is defined as stabilizable if and only if all its uncontrollable eigenvalues lie in the open left-half of the complex plane, i.e., they have strictly negative real parts ($\\text{Re}(\\lambda) < 0$). In this system, the uncontrollable eigenvalue is $\\lambda_{2} = 0$, which has a real part of $0$. Since this is not strictly negative, the system is not stabilizable. While we can make the controllable dynamics stable by choosing $k_{1} = -1$, the overall system cannot be made asymptotically stable because the state $x_{2}$, corresponding to the uncontrollable dynamics $\\dot{x}_{2}=0$, will not decay to zero unless its initial value $x_{2}(0)$ is exactly zero.\n\nThe specific value of the gain $k_{1}$ required to place the controllable eigenvalue at $-1$ is determined to be $-1$.", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{-1} $$", "id": "2697426"}, {"introduction": "The standard rank test for controllability can sometimes be misleading, especially for systems with oscillatory dynamics.

By definition, this subspace is the image of the controllability matrix $\\mathcal{K}$, which is defined as the linear span of the columns of the matrix $[B, AB, A^2B, \\dots, A^{n-1}B]$. For $n=3$, the controllability matrix is $\\mathcal{K} = [B \\;\\; AB \\;\\; A^2B]$.\n\nWe compute the required matrix products:\nFirst, the vector $B$ is given:\n$$\nB = \\begin{pmatrix} 0\\\\ 0\\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nNext, we compute $AB$:\n$$\nAB = \\begin{pmatrix}\n0 & -\\omega & 0\\\\\n\\omega & 0 & 0\\\\\n0 & 0 & \\alpha\n\\end{pmatrix}\n\\begin{pmatrix} 0\\\\ 0\\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}\n= \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ \\alpha \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nFinally, we compute $A^2B = A(AB)$:\n$$\nA^2B = \\begin{pmatrix}\n0 & -\\omega & 0\\\\\n\\omega & 0 & 0\\\\\n0 & 0 & \\alpha\n\\end{pmatrix}\n\\begin{pmatrix} 0\\\\ 0\\\\ \\alpha \\end{pmatrix}\n= \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ \\alpha^2 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe controllability matrix $\\mathcal{K}$ is therefore:\n$$\n\\mathcal{K} = [B \\;\\; AB \\;\\; A^2B] = \\begin{pmatrix}\n0 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n1 & \\alpha & \\alpha^2\n\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe controllable subspace $\\mathcal{C}$ is the column space of $\\mathcal{K}$. The columns of $\\mathcal{K}$ are $[0, 0, 1]^T$, $[0, 0, \\alpha]^T$, and $[0, 0, \\alpha^2]^T$. All of these vectors are scalar multiples of the standard basis vector $e_3 = [0, 0, 1]^T$. Thus, the subspace spanned by these columns is:\n$$\n\\mathcal{C} = \\mathrm{span}\\left\\{ \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix} \\right\\}\n$$\nThe dimension of the controllable subspace is $\\dim(\\mathcal{C}) = \\mathrm{rank}(\\mathcal{K}) = 1$. A system is controllable if and only if its controllable subspace spans the entire state space, which means $\\dim(\\mathcal{C}) = n$. In this case, $n=3$, and we have found that $\\dim(\\mathcal{C}) = 1$. Since $1 < 3$, the system is not controllable.\n\n**2) The PBH Test over the Real Numbers $\\mathbb{R}$**\n\nWe now analyze the rank of the matrix $[\\lambda I - A \\;\\; B]$ for an arbitrary real scalar $\\lambda \\in \\mathbb{R}$. The matrix is:\n$$\n[\\lambda I - A \\;\\; B] = \\left( \\begin{array}{ccc|c}\n\\lambda & \\omega & 0 & 0 \\\\\n-\\omega & \\lambda & 0 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & \\lambda - \\alpha & 1\n\\end{array} \\right)\n$$\nThis is a $3 \\times 4$ matrix. To show that its rank is $3$ for all $\\lambda \\in \\mathbb{R}$, we must demonstrate that it has a $3 \\times 3$ submatrix with a non-zero determinant for any real $\\lambda$. Let us consider the submatrix formed by columns $1$, $2$, and $4$:\n$$\nM = \\begin{pmatrix}\n\\lambda & \\omega & 0 \\\\\n-\\omega & \\lambda & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 1\n\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe determinant of this submatrix $M$ is calculated using cofactor expansion along the third row:\n$$\n\\det(M) = 1 \\cdot \\det \\begin{pmatrix} \\lambda & \\omega \\\\ -\\omega & \\lambda \\end{pmatrix} = \\lambda^2 - (\\omega)(-\\omega) = \\lambda^2 + \\omega^2\n$$\nThe problem specifies that $\\omega > 0$, so $\\omega^2 > 0$. The variable $\\lambda$ is restricted to $\\mathbb{R}$, so $\\lambda^2 \\ge 0$. Consequently, the sum $\\lambda^2 + \\omega^2$ is always strictly positive for any $\\lambda \\in \\mathbb{R}$.\n$$\n\\det(M) = \\lambda^2 + \\omega^2 > 0 \\quad \\forall \\lambda \\in \\mathbb{R}\n$$\nSince $\\det(M) \\neq 0$, the submatrix $M$ is invertible and has rank $3$. The full $3 \\times 4$ matrix $[\\lambda I - A \\;\\; B]$ therefore also has rank $3$. This reasoning is independent of the value of $\\alpha$, so it holds for both the case $\\lambda = \\alpha$ and $\\lambda \\neq \\alpha$. The misapplication of the PBH test, by restricting $\\lambda$ to $\\mathbb{R}$, incorrectly suggests that the system is controllable.\n\n**3) The PBH Test over the Complex Numbers $\\mathbb{C}$**\n\nThe correct PBH controllability criterion states that the pair $(A, B)$ is controllable if and only if $\\mathrm{rank}[\\lambda I - A \\;\\; B] = n$ for all eigenvalues $\\lambda \\in \\mathbb{C}$ of the matrix $A$.\n\nFirst, we find the eigenvalues of $A$ by solving the characteristic equation $\\det(\\lambda I - A) = 0$:\n$$\n\\det(\\lambda I - A) = \\det \\begin{pmatrix}\n\\lambda & \\omega & 0 \\\\\n-\\omega & \\lambda & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & \\lambda - \\alpha\n\\end{pmatrix} = (\\lambda-\\alpha)(\\lambda^2 + \\omega^2) = 0\n$$\nThe solutions for $\\lambda$ are the eigenvalues: $\\lambda_1 = \\alpha$, $\\lambda_2 = i\\omega$, and $\\lambda_3 = -i\\omega$.\n\nThe task requires us to identify the complex eigenvalue with a strictly positive imaginary part at which the rank drops. This eigenvalue is $\\lambda = i\\omega$. We now evaluate the rank of $[i\\omega I - A \\;\\; B]$:\n$$\n[i\\omega I - A \\;\\; B] = \\left( \\begin{array}{ccc|c}\ni\\omega & \\omega & 0 & 0 \\\\\n-\\omega & i\\omega & 0 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & i\\omega - \\alpha & 1\n\\end{array} \\right)\n$$\nLet the rows of this matrix be $r_1$, $r_2$, and $r_3$.\n$$\nr_1 = [ \\begin{matrix} i\\omega & \\omega & 0 & 0 \\end{matrix} ]\n$$\n$$\nr_2 = [ \\begin{matrix} -\\omega & i\\omega & 0 & 0 \\end{matrix} ]\n$$\nLet us investigate the linear dependence between the first two rows over the complex field. We can observe that the second row is a scalar multiple of the first row. Specifically, multiplying the first row by $i$:\n$$\ni \\cdot r_1 = i \\cdot [ \\begin{matrix} i\\omega & \\omega & 0 & 0 \\end{matrix} ] = [ \\begin{matrix} i^2\\omega & i\\omega & 0 & 0 \\end{matrix} ] = [ \\begin{matrix} -\\omega & i\\omega & 0 & 0 \\end{matrix} ] = r_2\n$$\nSince $r_2 = i \\cdot r_1$, the first two rows are linearly dependent. This means the rank of the matrix is less than $3$. The matrix is row-equivalent to one where the second row is all zeros:\n$$\n\\begin{pmatrix}\ni\\omega & \\omega & 0 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & i\\omega - \\alpha & 1\n\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe remaining non-zero rows, $[i\\omega, \\omega, 0, 0]$ and $[0, 0, i\\omega-\\alpha, 1]$, are linearly independent because their non-zero components are in different positions. Therefore, the rank of the matrix $[i\\omega I - A \\;\\; B]$ is $2$.\n\nSince $\\mathrm{rank}[i\\omega I - A \\;\\; B] = 2 < n=3$, the PBH criterion is not satisfied for the eigenvalue $\\lambda=i\\omega$. This proves that the system is uncontrollable, which confirms the conclusion from the fundamental definition in Part 1. The eigenvalue with a strictly positive imaginary part responsible for this rank deficiency is $i\\omega$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{i\\omega}$$", "id": "2697425"}]}
