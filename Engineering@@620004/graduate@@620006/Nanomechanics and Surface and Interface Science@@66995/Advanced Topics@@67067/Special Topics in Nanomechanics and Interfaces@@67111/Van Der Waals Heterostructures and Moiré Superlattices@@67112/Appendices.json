Each value must be rounded to exactly $6$ decimal places.", "solution": "The problem statement is assessed to be valid. It is scientifically grounded in continuum mechanics and solid-state physics, well-posed, objective, and provides a complete set of data and assumptions for a rigorous solution. We may therefore proceed with the derivation.\n\nThe analysis begins with the provided one-dimensional ansatz for the in-plane displacement field $u_x(x)$ across a domain wall aligned with the $y$-axis:\n$$ u_x(x) = u_0 \\tanh\\left(\\frac{x}{\\lambda}\\right) $$\n$$ u_y(x) = 0 $$\nHere, $u_0$ is half the total registry shift and $\\lambda$ is the characteristic half-width of the wall.\n\nThe strain tensor components are derived from the definition of the infinitesimal strain tensor, $\\epsilon_{ij} = \\tfrac{1}{2}(\\partial_i u_j + \\partial_j u_i)$. As the displacement field depends only on the coordinate $x$, partial derivatives with respect to $y$ (i.e., $\\partial_y$) are zero. The only potentially non-zero component of the in-plane strain tensor is $\\epsilon_{xx}(x)$:\n$$ \\epsilon_{xx}(x) = \\frac{\\partial u_x}{\\partial x} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} \\left[ u_0 \\tanh\\left(\\frac{x}{\\lambda}\\right) \\right] $$\nThe other in-plane components are $\\epsilon_{yy}(x) = \\partial_y u_y = 0$ and $\\epsilon_{xy}(x) = \\tfrac{1}{2}(\\partial_x u_y + \\partial_y u_x) = 0$.\n\nUsing the chain rule for differentiation and the provided identity $\\frac{d}{dz}\\tanh(z) = \\operatorname{sech}^2(z)$, we find the expression for the strain component $\\epsilon_{xx}(x)$:\n$$ \\epsilon_{xx}(x) = u_0 \\cdot \\operatorname{sech}^2\\left(\\frac{x}{\\lambda}\\right) \\cdot \\frac{1}{\\lambda} = \\frac{u_0}{\\lambda} \\operatorname{sech}^2\\left(\\frac{x}{\\lambda}\\right) $$\n\nThe problem specifies that the hydrostatic strain is to be taken as $\\epsilon_h(x) = \\mathrm{tr}(\\boldsymbol{\\epsilon}) = \\epsilon_{xx}(x) + \\epsilon_{yy}(x)$. With the explicit instruction to assume $\\epsilon_{yy}(x) = 0$, which is a common simplification for such one-dimensional models, the hydrostatic strain becomes identical to the longitudinal strain:\n$$ \\epsilon_h(x) = \\epsilon_{xx}(x) = \\frac{u_0}{\\lambda} \\operatorname{sech}^2\\left(\\frac{x}{\\lambda}\\right) $$\nThis strain is dimensionless, as $u_0$ and $\\lambda$ have the same units.\n\nFinally, the local shift of the Raman $G$-mode frequency, $\\Delta \\omega_G(x)$, is given by its linear coupling to the hydrostatic strain via the dimensionless Grüneisen parameter, $\\gamma_G$:\n$$ \\Delta \\omega_G(x) = -\\gamma_G \\,\\omega_G^0 \\,\\epsilon_h(x) $$\nwhere $\\omega_G^0$ is the $G$-mode frequency in the unstrained reference configuration.\n\nSubstituting the derived expression for $\\epsilon_h(x)$ yields the final formula for the Raman shift as a function of position $x$ across the domain wall:\n$$ \\Delta \\omega_G(x) = -\\gamma_G \\omega_G^0 \\frac{u_0}{\\lambda} \\operatorname{sech}^2\\left(\\frac{x}{\\lambda}\\right) $$\nIn this equation, $\\operatorname{sech}(z)$ is the hyperbolic secant function, defined as $\\operatorname{sech}(z) = 1/\\cosh(z)$. This expression correctly describes the Raman peak shift profile. The shift is maximal at the center of the wall ($x=0$) where the strain is maximal, and it decays symmetrically to zero far from the wall, where the material is unstrained. The negative sign implies that for typical materials with $\\gamma_G > 0$, a tensile strain ($u_0/\\lambda > 0$) induces a frequency redshift (negative $\\Delta \\omega_G$).\n\nThe program to be implemented will evaluate this function for the specified sets of parameters and sampling positions $x$. The parameters $u_0$ and $\\lambda$ are given in units of nanometers ($\\mathrm{nm}$), and the positions $x$ are also in $\\mathrm{nm}$. The ratio $x/\\lambda$ is therefore dimensionless, as is the strain term $u_0/\\lambda$. With $\\omega_G^0$ in units of $\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$, the resulting $\\Delta \\omega_G$ is correctly obtained in $\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$. The implementation will iterate through the provided test cases, compute the numerical values, format the results to $6$ decimal places, and present them in the specified aggregated list format.", "answer": "```python\n# The complete and runnable Python 3 code goes here.\n# Imports must adhere to the specified execution environment.\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Computes the Raman G-peak shift for a domain wall in a 2D material\n    based on a continuum mechanics model and Grüneisen parameter formalism.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Define the common sample positions and test cases from the problem statement.\n    x_positions = [-20.0, -10.0, -5.0, -2.0, -1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 2.0, 5.0, 10.0, 20.0]\n    \n    test_cases = [\n        # Case A: typical wall in a graphene-like layer\n        {'u0': 0.071, 'lambda_': 6.0, 'omega_G0': 1582.0, 'gamma_G': 1.8},\n        # Case B: no Raman coupling edge case\n        {'u0': 0.071, 'lambda_': 6.0, 'omega_G0': 1582.0, 'gamma_G': 0.0},\n        # Case C: narrow wall, enhanced strain\n        {'u0': 0.071, 'lambda_': 1.5, 'omega_G0': 1580.0, 'gamma_G': 2.0},\n        # Case D: no displacement edge case\n        {'u0': 0.0, 'lambda_': 5.0, 'omega_G0': 1582.0, 'gamma_G': 1.8}\n    ]\n\n    # List to aggregate all results from all test cases.\n    all_results = []\n\n    # Process each test case.\n    for case in test_cases:\n        u0 = case['u0']\n        lambda_ = case['lambda_']\n        omega_G0 = case['omega_G0']\n        gamma_G = case['gamma_G']\n        \n        # Derived formula for Raman shift:\n        # Delta_omega_G(x) = -gamma_G * omega_G0 * (u0 / lambda) * sech^2(x / lambda)\n        \n        # Calculate the constant prefactor for the Raman shift formula.\n        # This handles the edge cases (gamma_G=0 or u0=0) efficiently.\n        if lambda_ == 0:  # Avoid division by zero, though not present in test cases.\n            prefactor = 0.0\n        else:\n            prefactor = -gamma_G * omega_G0 * (u0 / lambda_)\n\n        case_results = []\n        for x in x_positions:\n            # The argument for the hyperbolic function.\n            arg = x / lambda_\n            \n            # sech(z) = 1 / cosh(z), so sech^2(z) = (1 / cosh(z))^2\n            sech_sq_val = (1.0 / np.cosh(arg))**2\n            \n            # Calculate the Raman shift using the pre-calculated factor.\n            delta_omega_g = prefactor * sech_sq_val\n            \n            case_results.append(delta_omega_g)\n        \n        # Add the results for the current case to the master list.\n        all_results.extend(case_results)\n\n    # Format the final output string with each value represented as a float\n    # with exactly 6 decimal places, as required for reporting precision.\n    formatted_results = [f\"{val:.6f}\" for val in all_results]\n    \n    # Print the final result in the exact specified format: a single\n    # comma-separated list enclosed in square brackets.\n    print(f\"[{','.join(formatted_results)}]\")\n\nsolve()\n```", "id": "2796955"}]}
