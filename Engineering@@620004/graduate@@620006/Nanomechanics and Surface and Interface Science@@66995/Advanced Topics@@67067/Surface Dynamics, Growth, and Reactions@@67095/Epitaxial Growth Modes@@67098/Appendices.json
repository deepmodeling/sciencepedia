It is not incomplete, contradictory, unrealistic, or trivial.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is deemed valid. A solution will be furnished.\n\nThe equilibrium configuration of a system is determined by the minimization of its total free energy. In the context of a film deposited on a substrate, the wetting behavior is governed by the balance of surface and interfacial energies. The change in free energy per unit area, $\\Delta\\gamma$, when the substrate surface is covered by a film is given by the replacement of the substrate-vapor interface with a film-substrate and a film-vapor interface.\n$$\n\\Delta\\gamma = (\\gamma_{fs} + \\gamma_{fv}) - \\gamma_{sv}\n$$\nThe condition for spontaneous spreading, or complete wetting, is that this change must be non-positive, $\\Delta\\gamma \\le 0$. This means it is energetically favorable for the film to cover the substrate. This condition, $\\gamma_{sv} \\ge \\gamma_{fs} + \\gamma_{fv}$, corresponds to the Frank–van der Merwe (layer-by-layer) growth mode.\n\nConversely, if $\\Delta\\gamma > 0$, or $\\gamma_{sv} < \\gamma_{fs} + \\gamma_{fv}$, it is energetically unfavorable to wet the substrate, and the film will form three-dimensional islands to minimize its contact area with the substrate. This corresponds to the Volmer–Weber (island) growth mode.\n\nThe Stranski–Krastanov mode involves initial layer-by-layer growth followed by island formation. This transition is typically driven by the accumulation of elastic strain energy due to lattice mismatch between the film and substrate. The problem statement explicitly requires that this strain energy be considered negligible. Therefore, we only need to distinguish between the Frank–van der Merwe and Volmer–Weber modes based on the surface and interfacial energies.\n\nLet us evaluate the wetting condition using the given data:\n-   $\\gamma_{sv} = 1.8\\,\\mathrm{J/m^2}$\n-   $\\gamma_{fv} = 1.2\\,\\mathrm{J/m^2}$\n-   $\\gamma_{fs} = 0.5\\,\\mathrm{J/m^2}$\n\nWe compare $\\gamma_{sv}$ with the sum $\\gamma_{fs} + \\gamma_{fv}$:\n$$\n\\gamma_{fs} + \\gamma_{fv} = 0.5\\,\\mathrm{J/m^2} + 1.2\\,\\mathrm{J/m^2} = 1.7\\,\\mathrm{J/m^2}\n$$\nSince $\\gamma_{sv} = 1.8\\,\\mathrm{J/m^2}$ and $\\gamma_{fs} + \\gamma_{fv} = 1.7\\,\\mathrm{J/m^2}$, we find that:\n$$\n\\gamma_{sv} > \\gamma_{fs} + \\gamma_{fv}\n$$\nThis inequality ($1.8 > 1.7$) signifies that the system's free energy is minimized when the high-energy substrate-vapor interface is replaced by the lower-energy combination of a film-substrate and a film-vapor interface. This condition corresponds to complete wetting. The expected epitaxial growth mode is therefore Frank–van der Merwe (layer-by-layer growth).\n\nThe equilibrium contact angle, $\\theta$, is determined by the balance of horizontal forces at the three-phase (solid-liquid-vapor) contact line, as described by Young's equation:\n$$\n\\gamma_{sv} = \\gamma_{fs} + \\gamma_{fv} \\cos(\\theta)\n$$\nSolving for $\\cos(\\theta)$ yields:\n$$\n\\cos(\\theta) = \\frac{\\gamma_{sv} - \\gamma_{fs}}{\\gamma_{fv}}\n$$\nSubstituting the provided numerical values:\n$$\n\\cos(\\theta) = \\frac{1.8 - 0.5}{1.2} = \\frac{1.3}{1.2}\n$$\nThis calculation results in $\\cos(\\theta) \\approx 1.0833$. The range of the cosine function is $[-1, 1]$. A value of $\\cos(\\theta) > 1$ is not mathematically possible for a real angle $\\theta$. This physical unfulfillment of Young's equation indicates that no static equilibrium with a finite contact angle can be achieved. The horizontal force component pulling the film to spread ($\\gamma_{sv} - \\gamma_{fs}$) is greater than the maximum cohesive force of the film's surface tension that resists spreading ($\\gamma_{fv}$). This results in an unbalanced force that drives the film to spread completely over the substrate, forming a uniform layer. For such a case of complete wetting, the equilibrium contact angle is, by definition, exactly zero.\n\nTherefore, the system exhibits complete wetting, the growth mode is Frank–van der Merwe, and the equilibrium contact angle is $\\theta = 0$ radians.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{0}\n$$", "id": "2771241"}, {"introduction": "Moving beyond the ideal case, this practice introduces a crucial factor in real heteroepitaxial systems: the elastic strain energy arising from lattice mismatch.

It represents a standard calculation in the theory of elasticity as applied to thin films and is directly relevant to the study of epitaxial growth phenomena. I will proceed with the derivation.\n\nThe objective is to derive the elastic strain energy per unit area, $U(h)$, stored in a coherent, biaxially strained thin film of thickness $h$. Let us establish a coordinate system where the film lies in the $x-y$ plane, with the interface at $z=0$ and the free surface at $z=h$.\n\nThe problem states that the film is grown coherently on a substrate with a uniform in-plane misfit strain $f$. This imposes a uniform biaxial strain state on the film. The in-plane normal strains are therefore equal to the misfit strain:\n$$ \\varepsilon_{xx} = f $$\n$$ \\varepsilon_{yy} = f $$\nDue to the biaxial symmetry, the in-plane shear strains are zero: $\\varepsilon_{xy} = 0$. The problem also states a \"spatially uniform strain state\", which means all strain components are constant throughout the film thickness.\n\nThe film has a traction-free surface, which means the stress component normal to this surface is zero, i.e., $\\sigma_{zz}=0$ at $z=h$. The given condition of a uniform strain state is interpreted as implying this condition holds throughout the entire film thickness, which is the standard plane-stress approximation for a thin film. Thus, we have:\n$$ \\sigma_{zz} = 0 $$\nBy symmetry, the other shear stresses are also zero: $\\sigma_{xz} = \\sigma_{yz} = 0$.\n\nWe use the constitutive relations for a linear isotropic elastic material (Hooke's Law).

In our case, with non-zero components only for $\\sigma_{xx}$, $\\sigma_{yy}$, $\\varepsilon_{xx}$, $\\varepsilon_{yy}$, and $\\varepsilon_{zz}$ (but importantly, $\\sigma_{zz}=0$), this simplifies to:\n$$ u = \\frac{1}{2} (\\sigma_{xx}\\varepsilon_{xx} + \\sigma_{yy}\\varepsilon_{yy} + \\sigma_{zz}\\varepsilon_{zz}) $$\nSince $\\sigma_{zz}=0$, the third term vanishes.\n$$ u = \\frac{1}{2} (\\sigma_{xx}\\varepsilon_{xx} + \\sigma_{yy}\\varepsilon_{yy}) $$\nSubstituting the expressions for the stresses and strains:\n$$ u = \\frac{1}{2} \\left( \\left(\\frac{E f}{1-\\nu}\\right) f + \\left(\\frac{E f}{1-\\nu}\\right) f \\right) = \\frac{1}{2} \\left( 2 \\frac{E f^2}{1-\\nu} \\right) $$\n$$ u = \\frac{E f^2}{1-\\nu} $$\nThis expression for the strain energy per unit volume is uniform throughout the film.\n\nThe total elastic strain energy per unit area of the film, $U(h)$, is obtained by integrating the strain energy density $u$ over the film thickness $h$:\n$$ U(h) = \\int_0^h u \\, dz $$\nSince $u$ is uniform with respect to $z$:\n$$ U(h) = u \\cdot h = \\frac{E f^2 h}{1-\\nu} $$\nThis is the desired analytical expression for the elastic strain energy per unit area.\n\nAn additional assumption made here is the interpretation of the \"spatially uniform strain state\" to justify the plane-stress condition ($\\sigma_{zz}=0$) throughout the entire film thickness.

Consequently, islands expand laterally and impinge before any appreciable second-layer nucleation occurs. The surface height therefore oscillates coherently as monolayers complete, leading to layer-by-layer-like RHEED oscillations even though the equilibrium wetting energetics favor Volmer–Weber.

It identifies the nonequilibrium mechanism: fast interlayer transport and low supersaturation suppress second-layer nucleation, so lateral coalescence yields apparent layer-by-layer growth despite unfavorable wetting. Verdict — Correct.\n\nOption B misidentifies the mode as Stranski–Krastanov. SK requires initially favorable wetting ($S > 0$) and an accumulation of elastic strain to trigger the three-dimensional transition; here $S < 0$, and the observed layer-by-layer is not due to an equilibrium wetting layer but due to kinetic suppression of second-layer nucleation. Verdict — Incorrect.\n\nOption C invokes a large Ehrlich–Schwoebel barrier to explain layer-by-layer. A large $E_{\\mathrm{ES}}$ impedes interlayer descent, increasing the residence time on upper terraces and promoting second-layer nucleation and mound formation (kinetic roughening), which is the opposite of the required suppression. Layer-by-layer at low $F$ and high $D$ is favored when $E_{\\mathrm{ES}} \\approx 0$ or when downward funneling is effective, not when $E_{\\mathrm{ES}} \\gg k_{\\mathrm{B}} T$. Verdict — Incorrect.\n\nOption D proposes a surfactant-mediated change in energetics converting the mode to Frank–van der Merwe, making the phenomenon equilibrium in origin. The problem stipulates ultra-high vacuum without surfactants, and the point is to explain layer-by-layer appearance under nonequilibrium kinetics with $S < 0$, not to change $S$. Verdict — Incorrect.\n\nOption E attributes RHEED oscillations to an artifact and claims kinetics are irrelevant at low $F$. This contradicts the quantitative estimate: low $F$ and high $D$ precisely generate the kinetic regime where interlayer transport and lateral capture dominate over second-layer nucleation, producing real morphological layer-by-layer signatures. RHEED oscillations in such conditions are well correlated with monolayer completion. Verdict — Incorrect.\n\nTherefore, the single best option is A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2771182"}]}
