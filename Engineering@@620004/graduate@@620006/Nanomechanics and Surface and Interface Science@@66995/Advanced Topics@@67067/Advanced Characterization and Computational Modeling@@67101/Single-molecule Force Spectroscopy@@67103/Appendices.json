It addresses the canonical worm-like chain (WLC) model, a cornerstone of polymer physics, to describe the force-extension properties of a semi-flexible polymer such as double-stranded DNA. The problem provides a valid energy functional and asks for the derivation of its known asymptotic behaviors and the application of a standard interpolation formula. All provided parameters are physically realistic for a single-molecule experiment. We proceed with the solution.\n\nThe problem begins with the elastic energy functional for a WLC of contour length $L_c$ and bending rigidity $\\kappa$ under an external stretching force $f$:\n$$ E[\\mathbf{t}] = \\frac{\\kappa}{2} \\int_{0}^{L_{c}} \\left|\\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{t}}{\\partial s}\\right|^{2} \\mathrm{d}s - f \\int_{0}^{L_{c}} t_{z}(s)\\,\\mathrm{d}s $$\nHere, $\\mathbf{t}(s)$ is the unit tangent vector at arc length $s$, and $t_z$ is its component along the direction of the force. The rigidity $\\kappa$ is related to the persistence length $L_p$ and thermal energy $k_B T$ by $\\kappa = k_B T L_p$.\n\nFirst, we analyze the low-force limit ($f \\to 0$). In this regime, the polymer behaves as a random coil on length scales much larger than $L_p$. The appropriate description is that of a freely-jointed chain composed of segments of the Kuhn length, $L_k = 2L_p$. The mean-squared end-to-end distance in the absence of force, for a long chain ($L_c \\gg L_p$), is $\\langle R^2 \\rangle_0 \\approx 2 L_p L_c$. Due to isotropy, the mean-squared projection onto the $z$-axis is $\\langle R_z^2 \\rangle_0 = \\frac{1}{3} \\langle R^2 \\rangle_0 = \\frac{2}{3} L_p L_c$.\nFrom linear response theory in statistical mechanics, the average extension $\\langle x \\rangle$ induced by a small force $f$ is:\n$$ \\langle x \\rangle = \\frac{f}{k_B T} \\langle R_z^2 \\rangle_0 = \\frac{f}{k_B T} \\left( \\frac{2}{3} L_p L_c \\right) $$\nThe dimensionless extension is defined as $z \\equiv \\langle x \\rangle / L_c$. This gives the linear response:\n$$ z = \\frac{2 L_p f}{3 k_B T} $$\nThis demonstrates that $z \\propto f$ in the low-force limit. The force-extension relation is therefore $f(z) = \\frac{3 k_B T}{2 L_p} z$, which is the entropic analogue of Hooke's Law for a polymer chain, consistent with the Kuhn-length identification.\n\nNext, we analyze the high-force limit ($f \\to \\infty$), which corresponds to the extension approaching the contour length ($z \\to 1$). Here, the chain is highly aligned with the force, and its conformation is dominated by small transverse fluctuations, $\\mathbf{t}_{\\perp}(s)$. The tangent's projection can be approximated as $t_z = \\sqrt{1 - |\\mathbf{t}_{\\perp}|^2} \\approx 1 - \\frac{1}{2}|\\mathbf{t}_{\\perp}|^2$. The end-to-end extension $x$ is:\n$$ x = \\int_0^{L_c} t_z(s) \\mathrm{d}s \\approx \\int_0^{L_c} \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{2}|\\mathbf{t}_{\\perp}|^2\\right) \\mathrm{d}s = L_c - \\frac{1}{2}\\int_0^{L_c} |\\mathbf{t}_{\\perp}|^2 \\mathrm{d}s $$\nThe fractional deviation from full extension is $1-z = \\frac{L_c - x}{L_c} = \\frac{1}{2L_c} \\int_0^{L_c} |\\mathbf{t}_{\\perp}|^2 \\mathrm{d}s$. The energy functional for these small fluctuations simplifies to:\n$$ E[\\mathbf{t}_{\\perp}] \\approx \\int_0^{L_c} \\left[ \\frac{\\kappa}{2} \\left| \\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{t}_{\\perp}}{\\partial s} \\right|^2 + \\frac{f}{2} |\\mathbf{t}_{\\perp}|^2 \\right] \\mathrm{d}s $$\nThis expression represents the energy of a set of harmonic oscillators corresponding to the chain's bending modes. Applying the equipartition theorem, where each quadratic degree of freedom contributes $\\frac{1}{2} k_B T$ to the average energy, allows for the calculation of the average squared amplitude of these fluctuations. The result, derived by summing over all fluctuation modes, connects the extension to the applied force:\n$$ 1-z = \\frac{k_B T}{2\\sqrt{\\kappa f}} $$\nSubstituting $\\kappa = k_B T L_p$ and solving for $f$:\n$$ f(z) \\approx \\frac{k_B T}{4 L_p (1-z)^2} $$\nThis expression shows the inverse-square divergence of the force as $z \\to 1$. The effective stiffness $\\frac{\\mathrm{d}f}{\\mathrm{d}x} = \\frac{1}{L_c}\\frac{\\mathrm{d}f}{\\mathrm{d}z}$ diverges as $(1-z)^{-3}$, which is a consequence of the energetic penalty for suppressing the remaining transverse thermal fluctuations.\n\nTo provide a description valid across all force regimes, we construct a closed-form interpolation formula that correctly reproduces both the low-force and high-force asymptotic behaviors. The Marko-Siggia formula is a well-established and accurate expression for this purpose:\n$$ \\frac{f L_p}{k_B T} = \\frac{1}{4(1-z)^2} - \\frac{1}{4} + z $$\nAs shown in the analysis of the limits, this formula correctly reduces to $f \\approx \\frac{3 k_B T}{2 L_p} z$ for $z \\to 0$ and $f \\approx \\frac{k_B T}{4 L_p (1-z)^2}$ for $z \\to 1$.\n\nWe now use this formula to compute the force for the given parameters:\n$L_p = 50~\\mathrm{nm} = 5 \\times 10^{-8}~\\mathrm{m}$\n$L_c = 10~\\mu\\mathrm{m} = 1 \\times 10^{-5}~\\mathrm{m}$\n$T = 298~\\mathrm{K}$\n$x = 9~\\mu\\mathrm{m} = 9 \\times 10^{-6}~\\mathrm{m}$\n$k_B = 1.380649 \\times 10^{-23}~\\mathrm{J\\,K^{-1}}$\n\nFirst, we determine the dimensionless extension $z$:\n$$ z = \\frac{x}{L_c} = \\frac{9 \\times 10^{-6}~\\mathrm{m}}{1 \\times 10^{-5}~\\mathrm{m}} = 0.9 $$\nNext, we evaluate the dimensionless term in the interpolation formula:\n$$ \\frac{1}{4(1-z)^2} - \\frac{1}{4} + z = \\frac{1}{4(1-0.9)^2} - \\frac{1}{4} + 0.9 = \\frac{1}{4(0.01)} - 0.25 + 0.9 = 25 - 0.25 + 0.9 = 25.65 $$\nThe force is then calculated by rearranging the formula:\n$$ f = \\frac{k_B T}{L_p} \\left( 25.65 \\right) $$\nThe thermal energy is $k_B T = (1.380649 \\times 10^{-23}~\\mathrm{J\\,K^{-1}}) \\times (298~\\mathrm{K}) \\approx 4.114334 \\times 10^{-21}~\\mathrm{J}$.\n$$ f = \\frac{4.114334 \\times 10^{-21}~\\mathrm{J}}{5 \\times 10^{-8}~\\mathrm{m}} \\times 25.65 $$\nSince $1~\\mathrm{J} = 1~\\mathrm{N \\cdot m}$, the units are consistent and yield a force in Newtons.\n$$ f \\approx (8.228668 \\times 10^{-14}~\\mathrm{N}) \\times 25.65 \\approx 2.11069 \\times 10^{-12}~\\mathrm{N} $$\nThe problem requests the result in piconewtons ($1~\\mathrm{pN} = 10^{-12}~\\mathrm{N}$), so $f \\approx 2.11069~\\mathrm{pN}$.

To solve for $L_p$ numerically without algebraic manipulation, we must find the root of the scalar function $g(L_p; z, f, T)$ defined as:\n$$\ng(L_p) = \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{B}} T}{L_p} \\left[ \\frac{1}{4 (1 - z)^2} - \\frac{1}{4} + z \\right] - f\n$$\nThe parameters $(z, f, T)$ are fixed for each case. We seek the value of $L_p > 0$ for which $g(L_p) = 0$.\n\nFirst, we analyze the properties of the function $g(L_p)$ to establish the existence and uniqueness of a solution. The term in the brackets, let us denote it by $C(z) = \\frac{1}{4 (1 - z)^2} - \\frac{1}{4} + z$, can be shown to be strictly positive for $z \\in (0, 1)$. The problem states that $T > 0$ and $f > 0$. The Boltzmann constant $k_{\\mathrm{B}}$ is also a positive quantity. Consequently, the term $A(z, T) = k_{\\mathrm{B}} T C(z)$ is strictly positive. The function to be solved simplifies to $g(L_p) = A/L_p - f$.\n\nThe derivative of $g(L_p)$ with respect to $L_p$ is:\n$$\n\\frac{dg}{dL_p} = -\\frac{A}{L_p^2} = -\\frac{k_{\\mathrm{B}} T C(z)}{L_p^2}\n$$\nSince $k_{\\mathrm{B}} > 0$, $T > 0$, $C(z) > 0$, and $L_p^2 > 0$, the derivative $dg/dL_p$ is strictly negative for all $L_p \\in (0, \\infty)$. This proves that $g(L_p)$ is a strictly monotonically decreasing function of $L_p$.\n\nNext, we examine the behavior of $g(L_p)$ at the boundaries of its domain $L_p \\in (0, \\infty)$:\n$$\n\\lim_{L_p \\to 0^+} g(L_p) = \\lim_{L_p \\to 0^+} \\left( \\frac{A}{L_p} - f \\right) = +\\infty\n$$\n$$\n\\lim_{L_p \\to \\infty} g(L_p) = \\lim_{L_p \\to \\infty} \\left( \\frac{A}{L_p} - f \\right) = -f\n$$\nSince $f > 0$, the limit at infinity is negative. Because $g(L_p)$ is continuous and strictly decreasing on $(0, \\infty)$ from $+\\infty$ to a negative value, the Intermediate Value Theorem guarantees the existence of a single, unique positive root $L_p$. This confirms the problem is well-posed.\n\nTo find this root, we employ a robust numerical root-bracketing method as stipulated. The bisection method is an appropriate choice due to its guaranteed convergence for any continuous function for which a bracket (an interval $[a, b]$ where $g(a)$ and $g(b)$ have opposite signs) can be found. Based on the limit analysis, such a bracket is guaranteed to exist.\n\nThe algorithm proceeds as follows:\n$1$. **Bracket Finding**: We must identify an interval $[a, b]$ such that $g(a) > 0$ and $g(b) < 0$. We can select a very small positive number for the lower bound, for example, $a = 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{nm}$, for which $g(a)$ will be large and positive. For the upper bound $b$, we can start with a candidate value, say $b_{init} = 1.0\\,\\mathrm{nm}$, and check the sign of $g(b_{init})$. If $g(b_{init})$ is positive, we iteratively increase the upper bound, for instance by doubling it ($b_{new} = 2 \\cdot b_{old}$), until $g(b)$ becomes negative. This expansion is guaranteed to terminate as $\\lim_{L_p \\to \\infty} g(L_p) = -f < 0$.\n\n$2$. **Iterative Refinement (Bisection)**: Once the bracket $[a, b]$ is established, we iteratively compute the midpoint $m = a + (b - a)/2$ and evaluate $g(m)$. Let $g_a = g(a)$. If $g_a$ and $g(m)$ have opposite signs (i.e., $g_a g(m) < 0$), the root lies in $[a, m]$, so we update the bracket by setting $b = m$. Otherwise, the root must lie in $[m, b]$, so we set $a = m$ and update $g_a = g(m)$. This process halves the interval of uncertainty in each step.\n\n$3$. **Termination Criterion**: The iteration continues until the width of the bracket, $b - a$, is smaller than a specified tolerance. The problem requires a hybrid tolerance: the stopping condition is met when the interval width is less than $\\max(atol, rtol \\cdot |m|)$, where $atol = 10^{-12}\\,\\mathrm{nm}$ is the absolute tolerance and $rtol = 10^{-9}$ is the relative tolerance, and $m$ is the current midpoint. The final estimate for $L_p$ is the midpoint of the final interval.\n\nThis procedure is implemented for each of the five test cases provided. The problem specifies the Boltzmann constant as $k_{\\mathrm{B}} = 0.01380649\\,\\mathrm{pN}\\cdot\\mathrm{nm}\\cdot\\mathrm{K}^{-1}$.

The total number of ligands, $N$, within the contact area $A$ is given by the product of the surface density $\\rho$ and the area $A$.\n$$N = \\rho A$$\nEach of these $N$ ligands represents an independent trial, with a probability of success (forming a tether) being $f$. The number of tethers formed, $k$, therefore follows a binomial distribution:\n$$P_{\\text{binomial}}(k; N, f) = \\binom{N}{k} f^k (1-f)^{N-k}$$\nThe problem specifies that the number of tethers is a Poisson random variable. This is the correct physical limit for the binomial distribution when the number of trials $N$ is large and the probability of success $f$ is small, such that their product, the mean $\\lambda = Nf$, is a finite constant. We verify these conditions with the given parameters:\n$$N = (1000~\\mu\\mathrm{m}^{-2}) (1~\\mu\\mathrm{m}^{2}) = 1000$$\nThe number of trials $N=1000$ is large. The probability $f = 1.0\\times 10^{-4}$ is small. The conditions for the Poisson approximation are therefore well-satisfied. The Poisson distribution for the number of tethers $k$ is given by:\n$$P(k; \\lambda) = \\frac{\\lambda^k \\exp(-\\lambda)}{k!}$$\nThe parameter $\\lambda$ is the mean number of tethers formed per approach, calculated as:\n$$\\lambda = N f = (\\rho A) f$$\nThe event of \"double tethering\" corresponds to $k=2$. Substituting $k=2$ into the Poisson probability mass function gives the expression for the probability of this event:\n$$P(k=2; \\lambda) = \\frac{\\lambda^2 \\exp(-\\lambda)}{2!}$$\nSubstituting the expression for $\\lambda$ yields the final derived expression in terms of the given parameters:\n$$P(k=2) = \\frac{(\\rho A f)^2 \\exp(-\\rho A f)}{2}$$\nNow, we evaluate this expression using the provided numerical values. First, we calculate the mean $\\lambda$:\n$$\\lambda = (1000~\\mu\\mathrm{m}^{-2})(1~\\mu\\mathrm{m}^{2})(1.0 \\times 10^{-4}) = 1000 \\times 1.0 \\times 10^{-4} = 0.1$$\nThe mean number of tethers per approach is $0.1$. Using this value, we calculate the probability of double tethering:\n$$P(k=2) = \\frac{(0.1)^2 \\exp(-0.1)}{2} = \\frac{0.01 \\times \\exp(-0.1)}{2} = 0.005 \\times \\exp(-0.1)$$\nUsing the value $\\exp(-0.1) \\approx 0.904837418$, we find:\n$$P(k=2) \\approx 0.005 \\times 0.904837418 = 0.004524187$$\nRounding this result to $3$ significant figures, as requested, gives:\n$$P(k=2) \\approx 0.00452$$\nFinally, we address the qualitative difference in the force-extension curve for a double-tether event compared to a single-tether event. Under quasi-static pulling, the two tethers in a double-tether event act as two identical springs (polymeric linkers) in parallel. The total force, $F_{\\text{total}}$, is the sum of the forces from each individual linker. For a given extension, $x$, the force contribution from a single linker is $F_{\\text{linker}}(x)$.\nFor a single-tether event, the measured force is:\n$$F_{\\text{single}}(x) = F_{\\text{linker}}(x)$$\nFor a double-tether event, with two identical linkers in parallel, the total force is:\n$$F_{\\text{double}}(x) = F_{\\text{linker}}(x) + F_{\\text{linker}}(x) = 2 F_{\\text{linker}}(x)$$\nTherefore, for any given extension $x$ prior to rupture, the force measured in a double-tether event is twice the force of a single-tether event. This means the force-extension curve for a double tethering will have a steeper initial slope, indicating a higher effective stiffness ($k_{\\text{eff}} = 2k_{\\text{linker}}$). Furthermore, the rupture signature will be distinct. A single-tether event shows one rupture event where the force drops to zero. A double-tether event will typically exhibit two sequential rupture events. As the force increases, one tether will break, causing the force to drop by approximately half to the force level of a single tether. The remaining tether is then stretched until it, too, ruptures, at which point the force drops to zero. This results in a characteristic two-step force drop in the retraction curve.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.00452}$$", "id": "2786680"}]}
