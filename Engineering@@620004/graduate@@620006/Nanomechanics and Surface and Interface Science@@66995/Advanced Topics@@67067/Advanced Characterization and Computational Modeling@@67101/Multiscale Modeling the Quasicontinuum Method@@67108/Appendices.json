The statement that $a_0$ corresponds to a \"stress-free equilibrium\" is a critical piece of information that implies a specific condition on the potential derivative at $a_0$. This is not an ambiguity but a physical constraint to be used in the derivation.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. A complete solution will be provided.\n\n**Derivation**\n\n1.  **Stored Energy Density, $W(F)$**\n    We consider an infinitely long chain to neglect boundary effects. The potential energy is associated with bonds between atoms. In the reference configuration, there is one atom (and thus one bond) per length $a_0$. The number density of atoms per unit reference length is $1/a_0$. Under a uniform deformation $F$, every bond has length $a = F a_0$ and stores energy $\\phi(a) = \\phi(F a_0)$. The total stored energy per unit reference length is the energy per bond multiplied by the number of bonds per unit reference length.\n    Therefore, the stored energy density $W$ as a function of the deformation gradient $F$ is:\n    $$W(F) = \\frac{1}{a_0}\\phi(F a_0)$$\n\n2.  **First Piola–Kirchhoff Stress, $P(F)$**\n    According to the problem definition, the first Piola–Kirchhoff (P-K) stress $P$ is the derivative of the stored energy density $W$ with respect to the deformation gradient $F$.\n    $$P(F) = \\frac{\\mathrm{d}W}{\\mathrm{d}F} = \\frac{\\mathrm{d}}{\\mathrm{d}F}\\left(\\frac{1}{a_0}\\phi(F a_0)\\right)$$\n    Applying the chain rule, where the argument of $\\phi$ is $u(F) = F a_0$ such that $\\frac{\\mathrm{d}u}{\\mathrm{d}F} = a_0$:\n    $$P(F) = \\frac{1}{a_0} \\cdot \\phi'(F a_0) \\cdot \\frac{\\mathrm{d}(F a_0)}{\\mathrm{d}F} = \\frac{1}{a_0} \\cdot \\phi'(F a_0) \\cdot a_0$$\n    $$P(F) = \\phi'(F a_0)$$\n    In this one-dimensional context, the P-K stress represents the force acting on a cross-section in the reference configuration.\n\n3.  **Cauchy Stress, $\\sigma(F)$**\n    The relationship between the first Piola-Kirchhoff stress $P$ (force per reference area) and the Cauchy stress $\\sigma$ (force per deformed area) is given by the tensor transformation $\\sigma = J^{-1} \\mathbf{F} \\mathbf{P}^T$, where $J = \\det(\\mathbf{F})$. In one dimension, $J=F$, and the tensors become scalars, so the transformation simplifies to $\\sigma = F^{-1} F P = P$. Therefore, the Cauchy stress is equal to the first Piola-Kirchhoff stress.\n    $$\\sigma(F) = P(F) = \\phi'(F a_0)$$\n\n4.  **Linearization and the Elastic Modulus, $E$**\n    The task is to find the modulus $E$ with respect to the engineering strain $\\varepsilon = F-1$, which implies $F = 1+\\varepsilon$. We first express the Cauchy stress as a function of strain, $\\sigma(\\varepsilon)$.\n    $$\\sigma(\\varepsilon) = \\phi'((1+\\varepsilon) a_0)$$\n    The modulus $E$ is the slope of the stress-strain curve at zero strain: $E = \\left.\\frac{\\mathrm{d}\\sigma}{\\mathrm{d}\\varepsilon}\\right|_{\\varepsilon=0}$. We compute the derivative using the chain rule:\n    $$\\frac{\\mathrm{d}\\sigma}{\\mathrm{d}\\varepsilon} = \\frac{\\mathrm{d}}{\\mathrm{d}\\varepsilon}[\\phi'((1+\\varepsilon)a_0)] = \\phi''((1+\\varepsilon)a_0) \\cdot a_0$$\n    Now, we evaluate this expression at $\\varepsilon=0$, which corresponds to the reference configuration where $F=1$ and $a=a_0$:\n    $$E = \\left.\\frac{\\mathrm{d}\\sigma}{\\mathrm{d}\\varepsilon}\\right|_{\\varepsilon=0} = a_0 \\phi''(a_0)$$\n\n5.  **Application of the Equilibrium Condition**\n    The problem statement specifies that the reference configuration with spacing $a_0$ is \"stress-free.\" In mechanical terms, a stress-free state means the Cauchy stress $\\sigma$ is zero at the reference state ($F=1$, $\\varepsilon=0$). Using our expression for Cauchy stress:\n    $$\\sigma(F=1) = \\phi'(1 \\cdot a_0) = \\phi'(a_0)$$\n    The stress-free condition, $\\sigma(F=1)=0$, therefore directly implies $\\phi'(a_0) = 0$. This is the mathematical statement of equilibrium for a nearest-neighbor potential: the force, which is proportional to $-\\phi'(r)$, is zero at the equilibrium separation $a_0$. Our derived expression for the modulus, $E = a_0 \\phi''(a_0)$, is already in its final form. The result is consistent with the physical meaning of the parameters: the modulus is the product of the equilibrium spacing and the curvature of the potential energy well at the equilibrium position, which describes the \"stiffness\" of the interatomic bond.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{a_0 \\phi''(a_0)}$$", "id": "2780454"}, {"introduction": "A key challenge in any multiscale method is the seamless coupling of fine-grained atomistic regions with coarse-grained continuum domains.

It is scientifically sound, well-posed, objective, and self-contained. I will proceed to solve the problem.\n\n### Solution Derivation\nThe core of the problem lies in satisfying two simultaneous requirements for an adaptive QC method: (i) accurate local resolution and (ii) patch-test consistency.\n\nFirst, let us analyze the patch test requirement. The patch test demands that for any homogeneous deformation, where the displacement field $u(x) = (F-1)x$ is linear and the deformation map $y(x) = Fx$ is affine, the QC model must be exact. This means two things: the QC energy must equal the full atomistic energy, and the force on every repatom must be zero (as they would be in a perfect, uniformly deformed lattice).\n\nIn an energy-based QC method where forces are derived from the potential energy, $f_k = -\\partial \\Pi^{\\mathrm{qc}} / \\partial y_k$, the zero-force condition is a direct consequence of the energy being exact. If $\\Pi^{\\mathrm{qc}}(y) = \\Pi^{\\mathrm{a}}(y)$ for a family of deformations including homogeneous ones, then the derivatives will also match. For a uniformly deformed infinite lattice, the force on any atom is zero by symmetry. Thus, the QC model must reproduce this. The non-zero forces that arise from an inconsistent formulation are known as \"ghost forces\".\n\nGhost forces typically appear at the interface between the atomistic region (where every atom is a repatom) and the continuum region (where repatoms are sparsely distributed). They are a result of an incorrect energy summation. Specifically, for potentials with a cutoff radius $r_c$, atoms near the interface in the continuum region may have neighbors in the atomistic region. If the energy calculation for these continuum atoms does not properly account for all interactions within the radius $r_c$, the total energy is wrong, and spurious forces arise. The standard remedy is two-fold:\n1.  **Exact Summation Rule**: Use a summation rule (like the cluster-based rule) that correctly counts all atomic bonds, including those that cross the boundaries of the finite elements defined by the repatoms.\n2.  **Interface Buffer**: Maintain a full atomistic region (a buffer) of thickness at least $r_c$ around any continuum region. This ensures that any atom treated by continuum assumptions has its full interaction neighborhood also treated explicitly, preventing \"broken\" bonds at the interface.\n\nNext, let us analyze the refinement criterion. The goal is to refine the mesh (i.e., add repatoms) where the continuum approximation is poor. The continuum approximation used in QC is the Cauchy–Born rule. The CB rule is exact only for homogeneous deformations. Therefore, a good error indicator should measure the local deviation from a state of homogeneous deformation.\n\nIn a state of homogeneous deformation with gradient $F$, the atomistic virial stress $\\sigma^{\\mathrm{vir}}$ is equal to the continuum Cauchy–Born stress $\\sigma^{\\mathrm{CB}}(F)$. That is, $\\sigma^{\\mathrm{vir}} - \\sigma^{\\mathrm{CB}}(F) = 0$. When the deformation is not homogeneous, as is the case near a defect or a crack tip, this equality no longer holds. The quantity $\\|\\sigma^{\\mathrm{vir}}(u_h) - \\sigma^{\\mathrm{CB}}(\\nabla u_h)\\|$ therefore serves as an excellent, physically-motivated local error indicator. It directly measures the failure of the underlying physical assumption of the continuum model. A large value indicates that the local deformation is highly non-uniform and cannot be accurately described by a single deformation gradient $F = \\nabla y_h$, so atomistic resolution is required. A term like $\\|\\nabla(\\nabla u_h)\\|$ (or $\\|\\nabla^2 y_h\\|$) which measures the curvature of the displacement field, is also a valid indicator, as high curvature implies a rapidly varying deformation gradient, but the stress-based indicator is more directly tied to the energetics and the CB hypothesis.\n\nWith these principles established, we can evaluate the options.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. Use an energy-based QC with the exact summation rule that counts bonds crossing each coarse element so that the QC energy equals the atomistic energy for any piecewise affine deformation. Define a residual-type error indicator on each coarse element $T$ by $\\eta_T^2 = \\big\\|\\sigma^{\\mathrm{vir}}(u_h)\\,-\\,\\sigma^{\\mathrm{CB}}(\\nabla u_h)\\big\\|^2\\,|T| \\;+\\; c\\,h_T^2\\,\\|\\nabla(\\nabla u_h)\\|^2$, where $u_h$ is the QC displacement field, $h_T$ is the element size, $|T|$ is the element measure, and $c>0$ is a constant. Refine elements with $\\eta_T > \\theta_{\\mathrm{ref}}\\max_{K}\\eta_K$ by inserting additional repatoms, coarsen where $\\eta_T < \\theta_{\\mathrm{crs}}\\max_{K}\\eta_K$, and enforce an interaction-aware interface by maintaining an atomistic buffer of thickness at least $r_c$ around defects and along atomistic–continuum boundaries. Retain piecewise affine kinematics and the exact summation rule after each mesh change.**\n\n-   **Patch-Test Consistency**: This strategy explicitly uses an \"exact summation rule\" and maintains an \"atomistic buffer of thickness at least $r_c$\". As derived above, this combination is precisely what is needed to eliminate ghost forces and ensure the patch test is passed at all times, even after adaptivity.\n-   **Refinement Criterion**: The indicator $\\eta_T$ has two components. The primary component, $\\big\\|\\sigma^{\\mathrm{vir}}(u_h)\\,-\\,\\sigma^{\\mathrm{CB}}(\\nabla u_h)\\big\\|$, is a direct physical measure of the local failure of the Cauchy-Born approximation, which is the desired behavior for an indicator. It will be large near defects and steep gradients. The second term, $c\\,h_T^2\\,\\|\\nabla(\\nabla u_h)\\|^2$, is a standard term from numerical analysis that penalizes high curvature, also indicative of steep gradients. This dual-term indicator is robust and well-justified.\n-   **Conclusion**: This option presents a complete and correct framework for adaptive QC. It correctly addresses both patch-test consistency and the need for a physically-motivated refinement indicator.\n\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\n**B. Use a force-based QC with linear blending between atomistic and continuum forces. Take the per-element indicator $\\eta_T = \\|\\nabla u_h\\|$ and refine wherever $\\eta_T > \\theta_{\\mathrm{ref}}\\max_K \\eta_K$. For summation, sample a single representative atom per element with weight equal to the element’s number of atoms (lumped quadrature). Do not enforce any special interface buffer; allow repatom spacing to change abruptly across the atomistic–continuum interface.**\n\n-   **Patch-Test Consistency**: This strategy has two fatal flaws regarding the patch test. First, \"lumped quadrature\" (a single sample point per element) is known to fail the patch test for non-local interactions as it does not correctly compute the energy of a uniformly deformed state. Second, and more critically, it explicitly states \"Do not enforce any special interface buffer\". Without a buffer of size $r_c$, interactions across the A/C interface are not correctly computed, leading to large ghost forces. Force-blending schemes are also notoriously difficult to make patch-test consistent without careful construction, which is not described here.\n-   **Refinement Criterion**: The indicator $\\eta_T = \\|\\nabla u_h\\|$ is the local strain magnitude. While large strain often correlates with the need for refinement, it is not a direct measure of the *error* in the continuum model. The CB approximation can be valid even for large strains if the deformation is homogeneous. This indicator is less sophisticated and less reliable than the one in Option A.\n-   **Conclusion**: This option fails the crucial requirement of maintaining patch-test consistency.\n\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**C. Use an energy-based QC that employs the Cauchy–Born energy density everywhere with no atomistic region. Let the indicator be $\\eta_T = \\|\\nabla(\\nabla u_h)\\|$. Refine where $\\eta_T$ is large, otherwise keep a coarse mesh. Use standard Gauss quadrature for the continuum energy, without bond-based exact summation. No special treatment near defects is used.**\n\n-   **Methodology**: This describes a pure non-linear Finite Element Method (FEM) using a CB-derived constitutive model. It is not a multiscale QC method because it has \"no atomistic region\". The entire purpose of adaptive QC is to introduce atomistic resolution where the continuum model (i.e., the CB rule) fails, such as at the core of a defect. This method cannot do that; it assumes the CB rule is valid everywhere, which is false for problems with defects.\n-   **Patch-Test Consistency**: A pure FEM model using the CB energy density will pass the patch test by construction, but this is irrelevant as it is not the correct type of model for the stated problem.\n-   **Refinement Criterion**: The indicator $\\|\\nabla(\\nabla u_h)\\|$ would trigger mesh refinement (creating smaller finite elements), but not a switch to a more fundamental atomistic model.\n-   **Conclusion**: This is not an adaptive quasicontinuum method capable of modeling defects. It fails to meet the fundamental requirement of locally enriching resolution with an atomistic model.\n\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**D. Use an energy-based QC with the exact summation rule and the indicator $\\eta_T = \\big\\|\\sigma^{\\mathrm{vir}}(u_h)-\\sigma^{\\mathrm{CB}}(\\nabla u_h)\\big\\|$. Refine on large $\\eta_T$, but permit coarsening to eliminate the atomistic buffer down to zero thickness when $\\eta_T$ falls below a threshold, even if interactions of range $r_c$ span the interface. Keep kinematics piecewise affine and update weights by element volume only.**\n\n-   **Patch-Test Consistency**: This option proposes to \"eliminate the atomistic buffer down to zero thickness... even if interactions of range $r_c$ span the interface\". This is a direct violation of the conditions required for patch-test consistency. As soon as the buffer is removed, atoms at the newly formed sharp interface will have incomplete interaction neighborhoods, their energies will be computed incorrectly, and significant ghost forces will be generated. The patch test will fail. The statement about updating weights \"by element volume only\" also suggests a move away from the \"exact summation rule\" upon coarsening, which is another source of error.\n-   **Refinement Criterion**: The indicator $\\eta_T$ is the physically correct, stress-based one. However, a good indicator cannot salvage a method that is fundamentally inconsistent.\n-   **Conclusion**: Although the refinement indicator is well-chosen, the coarsening strategy and interface treatment are incorrect and would re-introduce the very ghost forces the method is supposed to eliminate, failing the patch-test consistency requirement.\n\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\nBased on this analysis, only option A describes a theoretically sound and complete adaptive quasicontinuum strategy that satisfies both stated requirements.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2780409"}]}
