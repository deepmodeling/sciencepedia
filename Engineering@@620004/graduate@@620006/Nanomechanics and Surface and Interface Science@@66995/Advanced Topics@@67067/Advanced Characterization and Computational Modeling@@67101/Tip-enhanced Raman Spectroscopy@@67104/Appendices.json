This first exercise reinforces the direct connection between a molecule's vibrational energy and the resulting shift in the scattered photon's wavelength.

Round all reported values to four significant figures. Your final answer should be given as a row vector in the order: Raman shift, Stokes wavelength, anti-Stokes wavelength. Angles are not involved in this problem.", "solution": "The problem as stated is valid, scientifically sound, and self-contained. It requires a straightforward application of fundamental principles of physics. We proceed with the solution.\n\nThe core principles for this problem are the conservation of energy in inelastic light scattering and the relationship between a photon's energy, its wavelength, and its spectroscopic wavenumber.\n\nThe energy $E$ of a photon is given by the Planck-Einstein relation, $E=h\\nu$, where $h$ is the Planck constant and $\\nu$ is the frequency of the light. In a medium with refractive index $n=1$ (approximating free space), the frequency is related to the wavelength $\\lambda$ and the speed of light $c$ by $\\nu = c/\\lambda$. Thus, the energy can be written as:\n$$\nE = \\frac{hc}{\\lambda}\n$$\nSpectroscopists commonly use the wavenumber $\\tilde{\\nu}$, which is defined as the reciprocal of the wavelength, $\\tilde{\\nu} = 1/\\lambda$. The units for wavenumber are typically inverse centimeters, $\\text{cm}^{-1}$. This definition allows us to write the energy of a photon as being directly proportional to its wavenumber:\n$$\nE = hc\\tilde{\\nu}\n$$\nThis direct proportionality means we can conduct our analysis of energy conservation directly in the domain of wavenumbers.\n\nThe incident laser radiation has a specified wavelength of $\\lambda_{0}=633\\,\\text{nm}$. To work with wavenumbers in units of $\\text{cm}^{-1}$, we must first convert the wavelength to centimeters. Since $1\\,\\text{nm} = 10^{-7}\\,\\text{cm}$, we have $\\lambda_{0} = 633 \\times 10^{-7}\\,\\text{cm}$. The wavenumber of the incident photon, $\\tilde{\\nu}_{0}$, is therefore:\n$$\n\\tilde{\\nu}_{0} = \\frac{1}{\\lambda_{0}} = \\frac{1}{633 \\times 10^{-7}\\,\\text{cm}} = \\frac{10^{7}}{633}\\,\\text{cm}^{-1}\n$$\n\nThe problem is divided into three parts.\n\nFirst, we must determine the Raman shift. The Raman shift, $\\Delta\\tilde{\\nu}$, is defined as the magnitude of the change in wavenumber between the incident light and the scattered light. In Raman scattering, an incident photon of energy $E_0 = hc\\tilde{\\nu}_{0}$ interacts with a molecule and is scattered with a different energy, $E_{\\text{scattered}} = hc\\tilde{\\nu}_{\\text{scattered}}$. The energy difference, $\\Delta E = |E_{0} - E_{\\text{scattered}}|$, corresponds to the energy of a quantum of a molecular vibration, $\\Delta E_{\\text{vib}}$. This is given in the problem as a vibrational mode with wavenumber $\\tilde{\\nu}_{\\text{vib}}=1600\\,\\text{cm}^{-1}$. Thus, $\\Delta E_{\\text{vib}} = hc\\tilde{\\nu}_{\\text{vib}}$. By energy conservation, the energy difference between photons must equal the energy of the vibrational transition. Expressed in wavenumbers, this means the Raman shift is equal to the vibrational wavenumber:\n$$\n\\Delta\\tilde{\\nu} = \\frac{\\Delta E}{hc} = \\frac{\\Delta E_{\\text{vib}}}{hc} = \\tilde{\\nu}_{\\text{vib}} = 1600\\,\\text{cm}^{-1}\n$$\nThe problem requires four significant figures, and we interpret the given value $1600\\,\\text{cm}^{-1}$ as having this precision.\n\nSecond, we determine the wavelength of the Stokes-scattered photon, $\\lambda_{\\text{S}}$. Stokes scattering is an inelastic process where the incident photon loses energy by exciting a molecular vibration. The energy of the scattered Stokes photon is $E_{\\text{S}} = E_{0} - \\Delta E_{\\text{vib}}$. In terms of wavenumbers, this is:\n$$\n\\tilde{\\nu}_{\\text{S}} = \\tilde{\\nu}_{0} - \\tilde{\\nu}_{\\text{vib}}\n$$\nSubstituting the numerical values:\n$$\n\\tilde{\\nu}_{\\text{S}} = \\left(\\frac{10^{7}}{633} - 1600\\right)\\,\\text{cm}^{-1} \\approx (15797.7883 - 1600)\\,\\text{cm}^{-1} = 14197.7883\\,\\text{cm}^{-1}\n$$\nThe wavelength is the reciprocal of the wavenumber. We must convert the result from $\\text{cm}$ back to $\\text{nm}$:\n$$\n\\lambda_{\\text{S}} = \\frac{1}{\\tilde{\\nu}_{\\text{S}}} \\approx \\frac{1}{14197.7883\\,\\text{cm}^{-1}} \\approx 7.04333 \\times 10^{-5}\\,\\text{cm}\n$$\n$$\n\\lambda_{\\text{S}} \\approx (7.04333 \\times 10^{-5}) \\times 10^{7}\\,\\text{nm/cm} \\approx 704.333\\,\\text{nm}\n$$\nRounding to four significant figures gives $\\lambda_{\\text{S}} = 704.3\\,\\text{nm}$.\n\nThird, we determine the wavelength of the anti-Stokes-scattered photon, $\\lambda_{\\text{AS}}$. Anti-Stokes scattering occurs when an already excited molecule de-excites by transferring its vibrational energy to the incident photon. The energy of the scattered anti-Stokes photon is $E_{\\text{AS}} = E_{0} + \\Delta E_{\\text{vib}}$. In wavenumbers:\n$$\n\\tilde{\\nu}_{\\text{AS}} = \\tilde{\\nu}_{0} + \\tilde{\\nu}_{\\text{vib}}\n$$\nSubstituting the numerical values:\n$$\n\\tilde{\\nu}_{\\text{AS}} = \\left(\\frac{10^{7}}{633} + 1600\\right)\\,\\text{cm}^{-1} \\approx (15797.7883 + 1600)\\,\\text{cm}^{-1} = 17397.7883\\,\\text{cm}^{-1}\n$$\nThe corresponding wavelength in nanometers is:\n$$\n\\lambda_{\\text{AS}} = \\frac{1}{\\tilde{\\nu}_{\\text{AS}}} \\approx \\frac{1}{17397.7883\\,\\text{cm}^{-1}} \\approx 5.74783 \\times 10^{-5}\\,\\text{cm}\n$$\n$$\n\\lambda_{\\text{AS}} \\approx (5.74783 \\times 10^{-5}) \\times 10^{7}\\,\\text{nm/cm} \\approx 574.783\\,\\text{nm}\n$$\nRounding to four significant figures gives $\\lambda_{\\text{AS}} = 574.8\\,\\text{nm}$.\n\nThe statement that the TERS tip only modifies the local field amplitude implies that it serves to enhance the rate of scattering, but it does not alter the energies of the photons involved. Therefore, the frequency and wavelength shifts are identical to those in conventional Raman spectroscopy.

The problem is well-posed, providing all necessary information to deduce a unique, meaningful solution without ambiguity or contradiction. It correctly distinguishes between the total measured signal enhancement and the intrinsic per-molecule enhancement factor, which is the core of the problem. Therefore, the problem is deemed valid and a solution may proceed.\n\nWe begin from the fundamental statement provided. The measured Raman intensity, $I$, is proportional to the number of molecules, $N$, within the probed volume and the single-molecule Raman scattering yield, $Y$, under the specific local field conditions. This can be written as an equation:\n$$\nI = K \\cdot N \\cdot Y\n$$\nwhere $K$ is a proportionality constant that encapsulates all instrumental factors such as laser power, collection optics efficiency, detector sensitivity, and integration time. According to the problem statement, $K$ is identical for both the TERS and the far-field measurements.\n\nFor the TERS measurement, the intensity $I_{\\text{TERS}}$ is given by:\n$$\nI_{\\text{TERS}} = K \\cdot N_{\\text{TERS}} \\cdot Y_{\\text{nf}}\n$$\nwhere $N_{\\text{TERS}}$ is the number of molecules in the near-field volume and $Y_{\\text{nf}}$ is the per-molecule scattering yield in the plasmonically enhanced near-field.\n\nFor the conventional far-field measurement, the intensity $I_{\\text{far}}$ is:\n$$\nI_{\\text{far}} = K \\cdot N_{\\text{far}} \\cdot Y_{\\text{ff}}\n$$\nwhere $N_{\\text{far}}$ is the number of molecules in the far-field confocal volume and $Y_{\\text{ff}}$ is the per-molecule scattering yield in the unenhanced far-field.\n\nThe problem states the sample has a uniform molecular concentration, which we denote as $\\rho$. The number of molecules in a given volume $V$ is therefore $N = \\rho V$. Applying this to our two cases:\n$$\nN_{\\text{TERS}} = \\rho V_{\\text{nf}}\n$$\n$$\nN_{\\text{far}} = \\rho V_{\\text{ff}}\n$$\n\nSubstituting these expressions for the number of molecules back into the intensity equations, we have:\n$$\nI_{\\text{TERS}} = K \\cdot (\\rho V_{\\text{nf}}) \\cdot Y_{\\text{nf}}\n$$\n$$\nI_{\\text{far}} = K \\cdot (\\rho V_{\\text{ff}}) \\cdot Y_{\\text{ff}}\n$$\n\nTo find the relationship between these quantities, we take the ratio of the two intensities:\n$$\n\\frac{I_{\\text{TERS}}}{I_{\\text{far}}} = \\frac{K \\cdot \\rho \\cdot V_{\\text{nf}} \\cdot Y_{\\text{nf}}}{K \\cdot \\rho \\cdot V_{\\text{ff}} \\cdot Y_{\\text{ff}}}\n$$\nThe instrumental constant $K$ and the uniform molecular concentration $\\rho$ cancel, which is a critical step enabled by the precise conditions of the problem.

A common error is to mistake the intensity ratio $I_{\\text{TERS}}/I_{\\text{far}}$ for the enhancement factor, which is incorrect because the probed volumes are vastly different.\n\nNow, we substitute the provided numerical values into this expression:\n- $I_{\\text{TERS}}/I_{\\text{far}} = 2.5 \\times 10^{4}$\n- $V_{\\text{ff}} = 10^{-18}\\,\\text{m}^{3}$\n- $V_{\\text{nf}} = 10^{-21}\\,\\text{m}^{3}$\n\nThe calculation proceeds as follows:\n$$\nEF = (2.5 \\times 10^{4}) \\cdot \\frac{10^{-18}\\,\\text{m}^{3}}{10^{-21}\\,\\text{m}^{3}}\n$$\n$$\nEF = (2.5 \\times 10^{4}) \\cdot 10^{-18 - (-21)}\n$$\n$$\nEF = (2.5 \\times 10^{4}) \\cdot 10^{3}\n$$\n$$\nEF = 2.5 \\times 10^{4+3}\n$$\n$$\nEF = 2.5 \\times 10^{7}\n$$\nThe resulting enhancement factor is a dimensionless quantity, as it must be.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{2.5 \\times 10^{7}}$$", "id": "2796322"}, {"introduction": "A key power of spectroscopy is its ability to reveal molecular properties through selection rules, which dictate what is 'allowed' or 'forbidden' to be observed.
