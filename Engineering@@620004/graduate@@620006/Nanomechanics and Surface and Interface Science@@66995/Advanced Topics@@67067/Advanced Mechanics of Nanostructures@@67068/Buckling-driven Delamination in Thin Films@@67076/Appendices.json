It is a well-posed problem in continuum mechanics, grounded in the established principles of linear elasticity and plate theory. All necessary data are provided, and the objective is clear. I will now proceed with the derivation and calculation.\n\nThe problem requires the derivation of two quantities: the biaxial modulus $M_f$ and the bending stiffness per unit width $D$ for a thin, isotropic, linear elastic film.\n\nFirst, we derive the biaxial modulus, $M_f$. For a thin film where the thickness $h$ is much smaller than its lateral dimensions, a state of plane stress is a valid approximation for the in-plane response. The out-of-plane stress components are assumed to be zero: $\\sigma_{zz} = \\sigma_{xz} = \\sigma_{yz} = 0$. The constitutive relations (Hooke's Law) for an isotropic material under plane stress are:\n$$\n\\epsilon_{xx} = \\frac{1}{E_f}(\\sigma_{xx} - \\nu_f \\sigma_{yy})\n$$\n$$\n\\epsilon_{yy} = \\frac{1}{E_f}(\\sigma_{yy} - \\nu_f \\sigma_{xx})\n$$\nThe problem specifies a uniform equi-biaxial misfit strain, which induces an equi-biaxial stress state in the film, such that $\\sigma_{xx} = \\sigma_{yy} = \\sigma$. Consequently, the in-plane strains are also equal: $\\epsilon_{xx} = \\epsilon_{yy} = \\epsilon$. Substituting these conditions into the constitutive relation for $\\epsilon_{xx}$:\n$$\n\\epsilon = \\frac{1}{E_f}(\\sigma - \\nu_f \\sigma) = \\frac{\\sigma}{E_f}(1 - \\nu_f)\n$$\nThe biaxial modulus $M_f$ is defined as the ratio of the equi-biaxial stress $\\sigma$ to the corresponding strain $\\epsilon$.\n$$\nM_f = \\frac{\\sigma}{\\epsilon}\n$$\nFrom the preceding equation, we rearrange to find this ratio:\n$$\nM_f = \\frac{E_f}{1 - \\nu_f}\n$$\nThis is the expression for the biaxial modulus of the film.\n\nNext, we derive the bending stiffness per unit width, $D$. This quantity is derived from classical Kirchhoff-Love plate theory. The fundamental assumption of this theory is that plane sections initially normal to the plate's mid-surface remain plane and normal to the deformed mid-surface after bending. This implies that the in-plane strains $\\epsilon_{xx}$ and $\\epsilon_{yy}$ at a distance $z$ from the mid-surface are related to the curvatures of the mid-surface, $\\kappa_{xx}$ and $\\kappa_{yy}$, by:\n$$\n\\epsilon_{xx}(z) = -z \\kappa_{xx} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\epsilon_{yy}(z) = -z \\kappa_{yy}\n$$\nThe stress-strain relations for an isotropic plate, which is in a state of plane stress in each lamina parallel to the mid-plane, are given by:\n$$\n\\sigma_{xx} = \\frac{E_f}{1 - \\nu_f^2}(\\epsilon_{xx} + \\nu_f \\epsilon_{yy})\n$$\nSubstituting the kinematic relations into the stress equation:\n$$\n\\sigma_{xx}(z) = \\frac{E_f}{1 - \\nu_f^2}(-z \\kappa_{xx} - \\nu_f z \\kappa_{yy}) = -z \\frac{E_f}{1 - \\nu_f^2}(\\kappa_{xx} + \\nu_f \\kappa_{yy})\n$$\nThe bending moment per unit width, $M_{xx}$, is the integral of the first moment of stress over the film thickness $h$:\n$$\nM_{xx} = \\int_{-h/2}^{h/2} \\sigma_{xx}(z) z \\, dz\n$$\nSubstituting the expression for $\\sigma_{xx}(z)$:\n$$\nM_{xx} = \\int_{-h/2}^{h/2} \\left(-z \\frac{E_f}{1 - \\nu_f^2}(\\kappa_{xx} + \\nu_f \\kappa_{yy})\\right) z \\, dz\n$$\nThe term $\\frac{E_f}{1 - \\nu_f^2}(\\kappa_{xx} + \\nu_f \\kappa_{yy})$ is constant with respect to $z$ and can be taken outside the integral:\n$$\nM_{xx} = - \\left( \\frac{E_f}{1 - \\nu_f^2}(\\kappa_{xx} + \\nu_f \\kappa_{yy}) \\right) \\int_{-h/2}^{h/2} z^2 \\, dz\n$$\nThe integral evaluates to the second moment of area of the cross-section per unit width:\n$$\n\\int_{-h/2}^{h/2} z^2 \\, dz = \\left[\\frac{z^3}{3}\\right]_{-h/2}^{h/2} = \\frac{(h/2)^3}{3} - \\frac{(-h/2)^3}{3} = \\frac{h^3}{24} + \\frac{h^3}{24} = \\frac{h^3}{12}\n$$\nSubstituting this result back into the expression for $M_{xx}$ gives the moment-curvature relationship for the plate:\n$$\nM_{xx} = -\\frac{E_f h^3}{12(1-\\nu_f^2)}(\\kappa_{xx} + \\nu_f \\kappa_{yy})\n$$\nThe quantity multiplying the curvature terms is defined as the bending stiffness or flexural rigidity of the plate, $D$.\n$$\nD = \\frac{E_f h^3}{12(1 - \\nu_f^2)}\n$$\nThis is the expression for the bending stiffness per unit width.\n\nNow we perform the numerical evaluation using the provided data: $E_f = 150 \\times 10^{9}\\,\\text{Pa}$, $\\nu_f = 0.25$, and $h = 100 \\times 10^{-9}\\,\\text{m}$.\n\nFor the biaxial modulus $M_f$:\n$$\nM_f = \\frac{150 \\times 10^9\\,\\text{Pa}}{1 - 0.25} = \\frac{150 \\times 10^9\\,\\text{Pa}}{0.75} = 200 \\times 10^9\\,\\text{Pa}\n$$\nExpressed in standard scientific notation with four significant figures, this is $2.000 \\times 10^{11}\\,\\text{Pa}$.\n\nFor the bending stiffness $D$:\n$$\nD = \\frac{(150 \\times 10^9\\,\\text{Pa}) (100 \\times 10^{-9}\\,\\text{m})^3}{12(1 - (0.25)^2)} = \\frac{(150 \\times 10^9) (1 \\times 10^{-21})}{12(1 - 0.0625)}\n$$\n$$\nD = \\frac{150 \\times 10^{-12}}{12(0.9375)} = \\frac{150 \\times 10^{-12}}{11.25} \\,\\text{N}\\cdot\\text{m}\n$$\n$$\nD \\approx 13.333... \\times 10^{-12}\\,\\text{N}\\cdot\\text{m}\n$$\nRounding to four significant figures, this is $1.333 \\times 10^{-11}\\,\\text{N}\\cdot\\text{m}$.\n\nFinally, a brief comment on the roles of $D$ and $M_f$ is required. In the context of buckling-driven delamination, these two parameters represent competing energetic contributions.\nThe biaxial modulus, $M_f$, quantifies the in-plane stiffness of the film. The elastic strain energy stored per unit area in the compressed, unbuckled film is proportional to $M_f$ and the square of the misfit strain. This stored membrane energy is the thermodynamic driving force for the delamination process. A higher $M_f$ implies a larger energy release upon buckling, thus promoting delamination.\nThe bending stiffness, $D$, quantifies the film's resistance to out-of-plane bending. When the film buckles, it must curve, and this bending stores elastic energy. This bending energy represents an energy penalty, or a barrier, to the buckling process. A higher $D$ (e.g., for a thicker film) makes bending more difficult and thus inhibits delamination.\nTherefore, the initiation of buckling-driven delamination is governed by the competition between the membrane energy (related to $M_f$) that can be released and the bending energy (related to $D$) that must be invested to form the buckle.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 1.333 \\times 10^{-11}  2.000 \\times 10^{11} \\end{pmatrix}}\n$$", "id": "2765860"}, {"introduction": "With the fundamental stiffness parameters established, we can now address a central question: under what conditions will a delaminated film segment actually buckle?

This occurs at the wavenumber $k_c$ for which the quadratic energy term becomes zero, marking the onset of instability.\n$$f(k_c) = Dk_c^4 - Nk_c^2 = k_c^2(Dk_c^2 - N) = 0$$\nThe non-trivial solution is $Dk_c^2 - N = 0$, which gives:\n$$k_c = \\sqrt{\\frac{N}{D}}$$\nThe corresponding neutral buckling wavelength $\\lambda_c$ is:\n$$\\lambda_c = \\frac{2\\pi}{k_c} = 2\\pi\\sqrt{\\frac{D}{N}}$$\nComparing the two wavelengths, we find:\n$$\\lambda^{\\ast} = 2\\pi\\sqrt{\\frac{2D}{N}} = \\sqrt{2} \\left( 2\\pi\\sqrt{\\frac{D}{N}} \\right) = \\sqrt{2}\\lambda_c$$\nThis demonstrates that the meander wavelength, which corresponds to the minimum-energy post-buckled configuration in this simplified model, is a factor of $\\sqrt{2}$ larger than the critical wavelength for the onset of Euler buckling.\n\nNow, we evaluate the meander wavelength $\\lambda^{\\ast}$ numerically using the provided parameters:\n$h = 150\\,\\mathrm{nm} = 1.5 \\times 10^{-7}\\,\\mathrm{m}$\n$E_f = 150\\,\\mathrm{GPa} = 1.5 \\times 10^{11}\\,\\mathrm{Pa}$\n$\\nu_f = 0.25$\n$\\sigma_0 = 800\\,\\mathrm{MPa} = 8 \\times 10^8\\,\\mathrm{Pa}$\n\nFirst, we compute the in-plane compressive resultant $N$:\n$$N = \\sigma_0 h = (8 \\times 10^8\\,\\mathrm{Pa})(1.5 \\times 10^{-7}\\,\\mathrm{m}) = 120\\,\\mathrm{N/m}$$\nNext, we compute the bending stiffness $D$:\n$$D = \\frac{E_f h^3}{12(1-\\nu_f^2)} = \\frac{(1.5 \\times 10^{11}\\,\\mathrm{Pa})(1.5 \\times 10^{-7}\\,\\mathrm{m})^3}{12(1 - 0.25^2)}$$\n$$D = \\frac{(1.5 \\times 10^{11})(3.375 \\times 10^{-21})}{12(1 - 0.0625)} = \\frac{5.0625 \\times 10^{-10}}{12(0.9375)} = \\frac{5.0625 \\times 10^{-10}}{11.25} = 4.5 \\times 10^{-11}\\,\\mathrm{N \\cdot m}$$\nNow, we can calculate $\\lambda^{\\ast}$:\n$$\\lambda^{\\ast} = 2\\pi\\sqrt{\\frac{2D}{N}} = 2\\pi\\sqrt{\\frac{2(4.5 \\times 10^{-11}\\,\\mathrm{N \\cdot m})}{120\\,\\mathrm{N/m}}} = 2\\pi\\sqrt{\\frac{9 \\times 10^{-11}}{120}\\,\\mathrm{m^2}}$$\n$$\\lambda^{\\ast} = 2\\pi\\sqrt{7.5 \\times 10^{-13}\\,\\mathrm{m^2}} = 2\\pi\\sqrt{75 \\times 10^{-14}\\,\\mathrm{m^2}} = 2\\pi( \\sqrt{75} \\times 10^{-7}\\,\\mathrm{m})$$\n$$\\lambda^{\\ast} \\approx 2(3.14159)(8.66025) \\times 10^{-7}\\,\\mathrm{m} \\approx 5.4414 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{m}$$\nExpressed in micrometers and rounded to three significant figures, the meander wavelength is $5.44\\,\\mathrm{\\mu m}$.\n\nFinally, we address the energetics of delamination. The stored in-plane elastic energy per unit area in the adhered film, $U_0$, under equi-biaxial plane-stress conditions ($\\sigma_{xx}=\\sigma_{yy}=-\\sigma_0$) is:\n$$U_0 = u \\cdot h = \\frac{\\sigma_0^2(1-\\nu_f)}{E_f} h$$\n$$U_0 = \\frac{(8 \\times 10^8\\,\\mathrm{Pa})^2(1-0.25)}{1.5 \\times 10^{11}\\,\\mathrm{Pa}} (1.5 \\times 10^{-7}\\,\\mathrm{m}) = \\frac{(6.4 \\times 10^{17})(0.75)}{1.5 \\times 10^{11}} (1.5 \\times 10^{-7})$$\n$$U_0 = (3.2 \\times 10^6\\,\\mathrm{J/m^3})(1.5 \\times 10^{-7}\\,\\mathrm{m}) = 0.48\\,\\mathrm{J/m^2}$$\nFor straight delamination to be energetically favorable, the energy release rate $G$ must exceed the interfacial fracture energy $G_c$. The steady-state energy release rate for a straight delamination front, assuming relaxation of the stress perpendicular to the front under plane strain conditions, is given by:\n$$G_{straight} = \\frac{\\sigma_0^2 h (1-\\nu_f^2)}{2E_f} = \\frac{(8 \\times 10^8\\,\\mathrm{Pa})^2 (1.5 \\times 10^{-7}\\,\\mathrm{m}) (1-0.25^2)}{2(1.5 \\times 10^{11}\\,\\mathrm{Pa})}$$\n$$G_{straight} = \\frac{(6.4 \\times 10^{17})(1.5 \\times 10^{-7})(0.9375)}{3 \\times 10^{11}} = \\frac{9 \\times 10^{10}}{3 \\times 10^{11}} = 0.3\\,\\mathrm{J/m^2}$$\nSince the calculated driving force for straight delamination, $G_{straight} = 0.3\\,\\mathrm{J/m^2}$, is less than the given interfacial fracture energy, $G_c = 1\\,\\mathrm{J/m^2}$, straight propagation of the delamination front is not energetically favorable. Delamination can only proceed if the energy release rate is enhanced by out-of-plane buckling of the film, which is the defining characteristic of buckling-driven delamination. The meandering instability is a consequence of this buckling, with its characteristic wavelength $\\lambda^{\\ast}$ being determined by the interplay between bending stiffness and compressive stress, as derived above, rather than directly by the fracture criterion.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{5.44}$$", "id": "2765885"}]}
