The context of a uniaxial tension test is a standard experimental method. All concepts are physically sound.\n- **Well-Posed**: The problem asks for a conceptual analysis of definitions and their justifications, not for a single numerical solution.

It is not trivial, as it addresses a key conceptual shift from $3$D to $2$D mechanics.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem statement is valid. A full analysis of the options is warranted.\n\n### Analysis of the Statements\n\nThe core issue is the consistent definition of mechanical properties for a structure, graphene, that is effectively two-dimensional. In standard three-dimensional ($3$D) continuum mechanics, stress $\\sigma$ is defined as force $F$ per unit cross-sectional area $A$, and Young's modulus $E$ relates stress to uniaxial strain $\\varepsilon$ by $\\sigma = E\\varepsilon$. For a $2$D material, the cross-sectional \"area\" is problematic as the thickness is not unambiguously defined.\n\nA proper formulation for a $2$D material should ideally rely only on in-plane, measurable quantities.\nThe engineering strain is unequivocally defined from the change in length. For uniaxial tension along the length $L_0$, the strain $\\varepsilon$ is:\n$$ \\varepsilon = \\frac{\\Delta L}{L_0} $$\nThis definition is independent of the material's dimensionality ($3$D or $2$D).\n\nThe challenge lies in defining stress. Instead of a $3$D volume stress $\\sigma = F/A$ (units of $\\mathrm{N/m^2}$), one can define a $2$D stress, often called surface stress or force per unit length, as:\n$$ \\sigma_{2D} = \\frac{F}{W} $$\nwhere $W$ is the width of the ribbon, i.e., the length of the one-dimensional \"cross-section\". This quantity has units of $\\mathrm{N/m}$.\n\nWith these definitions, a $2$D Hooke's law can be formulated for the linear elastic regime:\n$$ \\sigma_{2D} = E_{2D} \\varepsilon $$\nHere, $E_{2D}$ is the two-dimensional Young's modulus, which has the same units as $\\sigma_{2D}$ ($\\mathrm{N/m}$) since strain $\\varepsilon$ is dimensionless. This entire framework ($ \\varepsilon, \\sigma_{2D}, E_{2D}$) is self-consistent and avoids the ambiguity of defining a thickness for the monolayer.\n\nNow, we evaluate each option based on this understanding.\n\n**A. The appropriate engineering strain for the uniaxial test is $\\varepsilon = \\Delta L / L_0$. A thickness-independent stress measure can be defined as the two-dimensional stress $\\sigma_{2D} = F / W$, and in the linear regime a two-dimensional modulus $E_{2D}$ relates $\\sigma_{2D}$ and $\\varepsilon$ via a uniaxial Hooke-type law without invoking any thickness.**\n\nThis statement is entirely consistent with the principles outlined above.\n- The definition of engineering strain $\\varepsilon = \\Delta L / L_0$ is correct.\n- The definition of the two-dimensional stress $\\sigma_{2D} = F / W$ is a valid, thickness-independent measure of stress for a $2$D sheet.\n- The formulation of a $2$D Hooke's law, $\\sigma_{2D} = E_{2D}\\varepsilon$, is the logical consequence, defining a $2$D modulus $E_{2D}$ that is an intrinsic property of the sheet, independent of any assumed thickness.\nTherefore, the statement is **Correct**.\n\n**B. Because the width changes under Poisson effect, the engineering strain should be defined as $\\varepsilon = \\Delta L / W$, and the corresponding two-dimensional stress should be taken as $\\sigma_{2D} = F / L_0$.**\n\nThis statement is nonsensical from a fundamental mechanics perspective.\n- Strain measures the fractional change in length *along the direction of loading*. Normalizing the elongation $\\Delta L$ by the initial width $W$ is physically meaningless. The correct denominator must be the initial length $L_0$.\n- Stress is defined as force per unit of cross-sectional dimension *perpendicular* to the force. Here, the force $F$ is distributed over the width $W$. Normalizing the force by the initial length $L_0$ does not represent a stress.\nThe definitions proposed are dimensionally and physically incorrect. Therefore, the statement is **Incorrect**.\n\n**C. The only physically correct way to report stress for monolayer graphene is to assume an effective thickness $t_{\\mathrm{eff}} = 0.335\\,\\mathrm{nm}$ equal to the graphite interlayer spacing and compute the three-dimensional Cauchy stress $\\sigma = F / (W\\, t_{\\mathrm{eff}})$; the two-dimensional stress concept is unphysical because stress must have units of $\\mathrm{N/m^2}$.**\n\nThis statement is dogmatic and scientifically flawed.\n- The claim that using an effective thickness is the \"only physically correct way\" is false. The $2$D formulation ($\\sigma_{2D}$, $E_{2D}$) is perfectly self-consistent and arguably more fundamental as it does not rely on an arbitrary convention for thickness.\n- The thickness of a single atomic layer is not a well-defined physical quantity. The value $t_{\\mathrm{eff}} = 0.335\\,\\mathrm{nm}$ is a common but arbitrary choice, borrowed from the bulk properties of graphite. It is a convention, not a measured property of the monolayer itself.\n- The assertion that $\\sigma_{2D}$ is \"unphysical\" because its units are not $\\mathrm{N/m^2}$ is a failure of logic. Physical quantities and their units are defined for utility and consistency within a theoretical framework. Stress, in general, is a measure of internal forces per unit of geometric extent. In $3$D, this is area; in $2$D, it is naturally length. Both are physically meaningful concepts.\nTherefore, the statement is **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. Defining $\\sigma_{2D} = F/W$ is consistent with work conjugacy: the mechanical work per unit undeformed area $A_0 = W L_0$ done by the uniaxial loading is $\\mathrm{d}W_{\\mathrm{mech}}/A_0 = \\sigma_{2D}\\, \\mathrm{d}\\varepsilon$ in the uniform case, so $E_{2D}$ can be obtained from the measured slope $\\mathrm{d}F/\\mathrm{d}\\varepsilon$ as $E_{2D} = (\\mathrm{d}F/\\mathrm{d}\\varepsilon)/W$.**\n\nThis statement makes two claims that must be verified.\n1. Work Conjugacy: The infinitesimal work done on the sample is $\\mathrm{d}W_{\\mathrm{mech}} = F \\, \\mathrm{d}(\\Delta L)$. The work done per unit initial area $A_0 = W L_0$ is:\n$$ \\frac{\\mathrm{d}W_{\\mathrm{mech}}}{A_0} = \\frac{F \\, \\mathrm{d}(\\Delta L)}{W L_0} = \\left(\\frac{F}{W}\\right) \\left(\\frac{\\mathrm{d}(\\Delta L)}{L_0}\\right) $$\nUsing the definitions $\\sigma_{2D} = F/W$ and $\\mathrm{d}\\varepsilon = \\mathrm{d}(\\Delta L)/L_0$, we directly obtain:\n$$ \\frac{\\mathrm{d}W_{\\mathrm{mech}}}{A_0} = \\sigma_{2D} \\, \\mathrm{d}\\varepsilon $$\nThis confirms that $\\sigma_{2D}$ and $\\varepsilon$ are work-conjugate variables, which provides a rigorous thermodynamic justification for these definitions. The first part of the statement is correct.\n2. Derivation of $E_{2D}$: From the $2$D Hooke's law, $\\sigma_{2D} = E_{2D}\\varepsilon$. Substituting the definition $\\sigma_{2D} = F/W$, we have $F/W = E_{2D}\\varepsilon$, which can be rearranged to $F = (W E_{2D})\\varepsilon$. The problem asks for the slope of $F$ with respect to $\\varepsilon$:\n$$ \\frac{\\mathrm{d}F}{\\mathrm{d}\\varepsilon} = \\frac{\\mathrm{d}}{\\mathrm{d}\\varepsilon} \\left( (W E_{2D})\\varepsilon \\right) = W E_{2D} $$\nSolving for $E_{2D}$ gives $E_{2D} = \\frac{1}{W}\\frac{\\mathrm{d}F}{\\mathrm{d}\\varepsilon}$, which is identical to the expression in the statement. Both parts of the statement are correct.\nTherefore, the statement is **Correct**.\n\n**E. To obtain the correct modulus in uniaxial testing one must correct the measured axial strain for Poisson ratio $\\nu$, so the proper strain measure is $\\varepsilon = \\Delta L / \\big(L_0 (1 - \\nu^2)\\big)$; otherwise the two-dimensional modulus inferred from $F$ versus $\\Delta L$ is overestimated.**\n\nThis statement introduces an incorrect modification to the definition of strain.\n- For a simple uniaxial tension test, where stress is applied only in one direction ($\\sigma_{xx} \\neq 0$, $\\sigma_{yy} = 0$), the Young's modulus $E$ is defined by the direct relationship $\\sigma_{xx} = E \\varepsilon_{xx}$. The Poisson's ratio $\\nu$ describes the resulting transverse contraction ($\\varepsilon_{yy} = -\\nu \\varepsilon_{xx}$), but it does not enter into the definition of the uniaxial modulus itself.\n- The factor $(1 - \\nu^2)$ appears when relating stress and strain under biaxial or plane strain conditions. For example, in a state of plane strain ($\\varepsilon_{zz}=0$), the relation is $\\sigma_{xx} = \\frac{E}{1-\\nu^2} \\varepsilon_{xx}$. The experimental setup described is uniaxial tension (plane stress if the ribbon is thin), not plane strain. Applying this correction to the definition of strain for a uniaxial test is a fundamental misunderstanding.\nTherefore, the statement is **Incorrect**.\n\n**F. If a three-dimensional Young’s modulus $E$ is nevertheless desired for comparison with bulk materials, one may define $E = E_{2D} / t_{\\mathrm{eff}}$, but the resulting value depends on the chosen $t_{\\mathrm{eff}}$ and is therefore convention-dependent rather than uniquely defined for the monolayer.**\n\nThis statement correctly addresses the procedure for and consequences of defining a $3$D modulus from $2$D properties.\n- To convert $\\sigma_{2D}$ to a $3$D stress $\\sigma_{3D}$, one must assume an effective thickness $t_{\\mathrm{eff}}$: $\\sigma_{3D} = F/(W t_{\\mathrm{eff}})$. Since $\\sigma_{2D} = F/W$, it follows that $\\sigma_{3D} = \\sigma_{2D}/t_{\\mathrm{eff}}$.\n- The respective Hooke's laws are $\\sigma_{3D} = E \\varepsilon$ and $\\sigma_{2D} = E_{2D} \\varepsilon$. Substituting these into the stress relation gives $E \\varepsilon = (E_{2D} \\varepsilon)/t_{\\mathrm{eff}}$.\n- For non-zero strain, we can divide by $\\varepsilon$ to get $E = E_{2D} / t_{\\mathrm{eff}}$. The dimensional consistency is $[\\mathrm{N/m^2}] = [\\mathrm{N/m}] / [\\mathrm{m}]$, which is correct.\n- The crucial part of the statement is that since $t_{\\mathrm{eff}}$ is not a physically unique or measurable quantity for a monolayer but a value chosen by convention, the resulting $3$D modulus $E$ is also convention-dependent. The intrinsic, unambiguous elastic property of the monolayer is $E_{2D}$. This assertion is correct and highlights a critical point in nanomechanics.\nTherefore, the statement is **Correct**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{ADF}$$", "id": "2770326"}, {"introduction": "This practice [@problem_id:2770320] connects an experimentally accessible quantity (axial stiffness, $k$) to a fundamental material property (Young's modulus, $E$) using a continuum shell model for a carbon nanotube.

The in-plane stresses ($\\sigma_{xx}, \\sigma_{yy}, \\sigma_{xy}$) are related to the in-plane strains ($\\varepsilon_{xx}, \\varepsilon_{yy}, \\varepsilon_{xy}$) as follows:\n$$ \\sigma_{xx} = \\frac{E}{1-\\nu^2}(\\varepsilon_{xx} + \\nu \\varepsilon_{yy}) $$\n$$ \\sigma_{yy} = \\frac{E}{1-\\nu^2}(\\varepsilon_{yy} + \\nu \\varepsilon_{xx}) $$\n$$ \\sigma_{xy} = \\frac{E}{1+\\nu}\\varepsilon_{xy} $$\nThe plate's mid-plane is the $xy$-plane, and the thickness coordinate $z$ spans from $-t/2$ to $t/2$.\n\nThe first part of the problem involves deriving the relation for the in-plane modulus, $Y_{2\\mathrm{D}}$. According to the Kirchhoff-Love plate theory for in-plane stretching, the strain field is uniform across the thickness. The 2D force resultants, $N_{ij}$, are defined as the integral of the 3D stress over the thickness:\n$$ N_{ij} = \\int_{-t/2}^{t/2} \\sigma_{ij} dz $$\nSince $\\sigma_{ij}$ is constant with respect to $z$ in this case, $N_{ij} = \\sigma_{ij} t$. The 2D Young's modulus, $Y_{2\\mathrm{D}}$, is defined under uniaxial tension, for example, along the $x$-axis, such that $N_{xx} = Y_{2\\mathrm{D}} \\varepsilon_{xx}$ while $N_{yy} = 0$.

Comparing this to the definition $N_{xx} = Y_{2\\mathrm{D}}\\varepsilon_{xx}$, we obtain the first fundamental relation:\n$$ Y_{2\\mathrm{D}} = Et $$\n\nNext, we derive the relation for the bending rigidity, $\\kappa$. For pure bending, the Kirchhoff-Love kinematics dictate that the strain varies linearly through the thickness: $\\varepsilon_{ij}(z) = -z \\chi_{ij}$, where $\\chi_{ij}$ is the curvature tensor of the mid-plane. The bending moment resultants, $M_{ij}$, are defined as the first moment of the stress about the mid-plane:\n$$ M_{ij} = \\int_{-t/2}^{t/2} z \\sigma_{ij}(z) dz $$\nSubstituting the expressions for stress and strain into the definition for $M_{xx}$:\n$$ M_{xx} = \\int_{-t/2}^{t/2} z \\left[ \\frac{E}{1-\\nu^2}(\\varepsilon_{xx}(z) + \\nu \\varepsilon_{yy}(z)) \\right] dz = -\\frac{E(\\chi_{xx} + \\nu\\chi_{yy})}{1-\\nu^2} \\int_{-t/2}^{t/2} z^2 dz $$\nThe integral is $\\int_{-t/2}^{t/2} z^2 dz = \\frac{t^3}{12}$. The moment-curvature relation is thus $M_{xx} = -\\frac{Et^3}{12(1-\\nu^2)}(\\chi_{xx} + \\nu\\chi_{yy})$. The prefactor is defined as the bending rigidity $\\kappa$ (also known as flexural rigidity $D$ in plate theory). This gives the second fundamental relation:\n$$ \\kappa = \\frac{Et^3}{12(1-\\nu^2)} $$\n\nThe second part of the problem requires a critical evaluation of the conventional parameters $E_0 \\approx 1\\,\\mathrm{TPa}$ and $t_0 = 0.335\\,\\mathrm{nm}$. We use the derived formula for $\\kappa$ with $E_0 = 1 \\times 10^{12}\\,\\mathrm{Pa}$, $t_0 = 0.335 \\times 10^{-9}\\,\\mathrm{m}$, and $\\nu = 0.165$:\n$$ \\kappa_{\\mathrm{implied}} = \\frac{(1 \\times 10^{12}\\,\\mathrm{N/m^2}) (0.335 \\times 10^{-9}\\,\\mathrm{m})^3}{12(1 - 0.165^2)} \\approx 3.2206 \\times 10^{-18}\\,\\mathrm{J} $$\nThe representative measured bending rigidity is $\\kappa_{\\mathrm{exp}} = 1.1\\,\\mathrm{eV}$. Using the conversion $1\\,\\mathrm{eV} = 1.602 \\times 10^{-19}\\,\\mathrm{J}$, this is:\n$$ \\kappa_{\\mathrm{exp}} = 1.1 \\times (1.602 \\times 10^{-19}\\,\\mathrm{J}) = 1.7622 \\times 10^{-19}\\,\\mathrm{J} $$\nThe value implied by the conventional parameters is approximately $18$ times larger than the measured value. Therefore, the choice $(E_0, t_0)$ is not self-consistent within the simple isotropic plate model; it accurately captures in-plane stiffness but fails dramatically for out-of-plane bending.\n\nThe third part requires constructing a consistent parameter set $\\{E, t\\}$ that simultaneously matches both $Y_{2\\mathrm{D}} = 340\\,\\mathrm{N/m}$ and $\\kappa_{\\mathrm{exp}} = 1.1\\,\\mathrm{eV}$. We have a system of two equations:\n$$ Y_{2\\mathrm{D}} = Et $$\n$$ \\kappa_{\\mathrm{exp}} = \\frac{Et^3}{12(1-\\nu^2)} $$\nWe solve for the thickness $t$. From the first equation, $E = Y_{2\\mathrm{D}}/t$. Substituting this into the second equation isolates $t$:\n$$ \\kappa_{\\mathrm{exp}} = \\frac{(Y_{2\\mathrm{D}}/t)t^3}{12(1-\\nu^2)} = \\frac{Y_{2\\mathrm{D}}t^2}{12(1-\\nu^2)} $$\n$$ t^2 = \\frac{12 \\kappa_{\\mathrm{exp}}(1-\\nu^2)}{Y_{2\\mathrm{D}}} $$\nWe substitute the numerical values: $Y_{2\\mathrm{D}} = 340\\,\\mathrm{N/m}$, $\\kappa_{\\mathrm{exp}} = 1.7622 \\times 10^{-19}\\,\\mathrm{J}$, and $\\nu = 0.165$.\n$$ t^2 = \\frac{12 \\times (1.7622 \\times 10^{-19}\\,\\mathrm{J}) \\times (1 - 0.165^2)}{340\\,\\mathrm{N/m}} \\approx 6.0501 \\times 10^{-21}\\,\\mathrm{m^2} $$\nTaking the square root for $t$:\n$$ t = \\sqrt{6.0501 \\times 10^{-21}\\,\\mathrm{m^2}} \\approx 7.7782 \\times 10^{-11}\\,\\mathrm{m} $$\nExpressing the final answer in nanometers ($1\\,\\mathrm{nm} = 10^{-9}\\,\\mathrm{m}$) and rounding to three significant figures gives:\n$$ t \\approx 0.0778\\,\\mathrm{nm} $$\nThis result highlights a known limitation of this model: to make the theory consistent with both in-plane and bending experiments, one must adopt an effective thickness that is significantly smaller than any physical dimension, such as the interlayer spacing of graphite.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.0778}$$", "id": "2770365"}]}
