It presents a standard task in continuum mechanics related to the elastic stability of anisotropic materials. All required data and definitions are provided, and there are no contradictions or factual errors. The problem is therefore valid for solution.\n\nThe primary condition for elastic stability is that the strain energy density, $U$, must be positive for any non-zero strain state. The strain energy density is given by the quadratic form $U = \\frac{1}{2}\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}^{\\mathsf{T}} \\mathbf{C} \\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}$, where $\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}$ is the strain vector in Voigt notation, $\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon} = (\\varepsilon_1, \\varepsilon_2, \\varepsilon_3, \\varepsilon_4, \\varepsilon_5, \\varepsilon_6)^{\\mathsf{T}}$, and $\\mathbf{C}$ is the $6 \\times 6$ symmetric stiffness matrix. The condition $U>0$ for all $\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon} \\neq \\mathbf{0}$ is mathematically equivalent to the requirement that the matrix $\\mathbf{C}$ be positive definite.\n\nThe stiffness matrix for a hexagonal crystal is given as:\n$$\n\\mathbf{C} =\n\\begin{pmatrix}\nC_{11}  C_{12}  C_{13}  0  0  0 \\\\\nC_{12}  C_{11}  C_{13}  0  0  0 \\\\\nC_{13}  C_{13}  C_{33}  0  0  0 \\\\\n0  0  0  C_{44}  0  0 \\\\\n0  0  0  0  C_{44}  0 \\\\\n0  0  0  0  0  C_{66}\n\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nwith the additional constraint $C_{66} = \\frac{1}{2}(C_{11} - C_{12})$. The block-diagonal structure of this matrix allows us to analyze its positive definiteness by examining its constituent blocks. The strain energy density can be written as:\n$$\n2U = \\left( C_{11}\\varepsilon_1^2 + C_{11}\\varepsilon_2^2 + C_{33}\\varepsilon_3^2 + 2C_{12}\\varepsilon_1\\varepsilon_2 + 2C_{13}\\varepsilon_1\\varepsilon_3 + 2C_{13}\\varepsilon_2\\varepsilon_3 \\right) + C_{44}\\varepsilon_4^2 + C_{44}\\varepsilon_5^2 + C_{66}\\varepsilon_6^2\n$$\nFor $U$ to be positive for any non-zero strain, each independent part of the quadratic form must be positive definite.\n\nFrom the shear strain terms, we immediately obtain the conditions:\n1. $C_{44} > 0$\n2. $C_{66} > 0$. Using the given constraint, this becomes $\\frac{1}{2}(C_{11} - C_{12}) > 0$, which implies $C_{11} > C_{12}$.\n\nThe term involving normal strains $(\\varepsilon_1, \\varepsilon_2, \\varepsilon_3)$ corresponds to the $3 \\times 3$ submatrix:\n$$\n\\mathbf{C}' =\n\\begin{pmatrix}\nC_{11}  C_{12}  C_{13} \\\\\nC_{12}  C_{11}  C_{13} \\\\\nC_{13}  C_{13}  C_{33}\n\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThis submatrix must also be positive definite. We apply Sylvester's criterion, which states that a symmetric matrix is positive definite if and only if all its leading principal minors are positive.\nThe first leading principal minor is $D_1 = C_{11}$. For this to be positive, we must have $C_{11} > 0$.\nThe second leading principal minor is $D_2 = \\det\\begin{pmatrix} C_{11}  C_{12} \\\\ C_{12}  C_{11} \\end{pmatrix} = C_{11}^2 - C_{12}^2 > 0$. Since $C_{11}$ must be positive, this is equivalent to $C_{11} > |C_{12}|$. This condition is stricter than $C_{11} > C_{12}$ and implies it.\nThe third leading principal minor is $D_3 = \\det(\\mathbf{C}')$. We calculate it by cofactor expansion or row operations.

This condition is satisfied.\n2. $C_{11} > |C_{12}| \\implies 200 > |100|$, which is $200 > 100$. This condition is satisfied.\n3. $(C_{11}+C_{12})C_{33} - 2C_{13}^2 > 0$. We compute the left-hand side:\n$$\n(200+100)(50) - 2(50\\sqrt{3})^2 = (300)(50) - 2(2500 \\times 3) = 15000 - 15000 = 0\n$$\nThe expression evaluates to exactly $0$. The inequality is not strictly satisfied but is saturated ($0 \\ge 0$ holds but $0 > 0$ does not). This indicates that the crystal is **marginally stable**. There exists a non-zero normal-strain mode for which the strain energy is zero.\n\nThis zero-energy mode corresponds to the null-space of the matrix $\\mathbf{C}'$. We find the strain vector $\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}' = (\\varepsilon_1, \\varepsilon_2, \\varepsilon_3)^{\\mathsf{T}}$ that solves $\\mathbf{C}' \\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}' = \\mathbf{0}$.\n$$\n\\begin{pmatrix} 200  100  50\\sqrt{3} \\\\ 100  200  50\\sqrt{3} \\\\ 50\\sqrt{3}  50\\sqrt{3}  50 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} \\varepsilon_1 \\\\ \\varepsilon_2 \\\\ \\varepsilon_3 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nSubtracting the first equation from the second gives $-100\\varepsilon_1 + 100\\varepsilon_2 = 0$, which implies $\\varepsilon_1 = \\varepsilon_2$. Substituting this into the third equation (after dividing by $50$):\n$$\n\\sqrt{3}\\varepsilon_1 + \\sqrt{3}\\varepsilon_1 + \\varepsilon_3 = 0 \\implies 2\\sqrt{3}\\varepsilon_1 + \\varepsilon_3 = 0 \\implies \\varepsilon_3 = -2\\sqrt{3}\\varepsilon_1\n$$\nThe normal-strain mode is thus defined by the ratio $(\\varepsilon_1, \\varepsilon_2, \\varepsilon_3) \\propto (1, 1, -2\\sqrt{3})$.\n\nFinally, we compute the smallest eigenvalue $\\lambda_{\\min}$ of the full $6 \\times 6$ matrix $\\mathbf{C}$. The eigenvalues of a block-diagonal matrix are the eigenvalues of its diagonal blocks. The eigenvalues of $\\mathbf{C}$ are the union of the eigenvalues of $\\mathbf{C}'$ and the diagonal entries $C_{44}$, $C_{44}$, and $C_{66}$.\nThe eigenvalues from the shear components are:\n- $\\lambda = C_{44} = 40$ (with multiplicity $2$)\n- $\\lambda = C_{66} = \\frac{1}{2}(C_{11}-C_{12}) = \\frac{1}{2}(200-100) = 50$\n\nFor the eigenvalues of $\\mathbf{C}'$, we already know that $\\det(\\mathbf{C}') = 0$, so one eigenvalue must be $0$. Let the eigenvalues of $\\mathbf{C}'$ be $\\lambda'_1, \\lambda'_2, \\lambda'_3$. So, one is $0$. To find the others, we can solve the characteristic equation $\\det(\\mathbf{C}'-\\lambda\\mathbf{I})=0$.\nThe problem can be simplified by exploiting symmetry. One eigenvector is of the form $(1, -1, 0)^{\\mathsf{T}}$, which gives the eigenvalue $\\lambda' = C_{11}-C_{12} = 200-100 = 100$.\nThe other two eigenvectors are orthogonal to this and of the form $(a, a, b)^{\\mathsf{T}}$.

The governing base is as follows: the linear elastic constitutive law $\\sigma_{ij} = C_{ijkl} \\varepsilon_{kl}$, the equation of motion $\\rho \\, \\partial^2 u_i / \\partial t^2 = \\partial_j \\sigma_{ij}$, and the plane-wave ansatz $u_i(\\mathbf{x},t) = U_i \\exp\\!\\left(i k \\, n_j x_j - i \\omega t\\right)$ leading to the Christoffel equation $\\Gamma_{ik} U_k = \\rho v^2 U_i$, where $\\Gamma_{ik} = C_{ijkl} n_j n_l$, $\\rho$ is the mass density, $v = \\omega/k$ is the phase velocity, and $n_j$ is the unit propagation direction.

It presents a standard problem in the mechanics of crystalline solids: the determination of elastic constants from acoustic wave speed measurements. The provided data and physical framework are consistent with established principles of continuum mechanics and crystal physics. We may proceed with the solution.\n\nThe task is to determine the three independent elastic stiffness constants of a cubic crystal, $C_{11}$, $C_{12}$, and $C_{44}$, by solving a linear least-squares problem constructed from ultrasonic velocity measurements.\n\nThe derivation must begin from first principles, as stipulated. The governing equations are the linear elastic constitutive law and the equation of motion. In the absence of body forces, the equation of motion is:\n$$\n\\rho \\frac{\\partial^2 u_i}{\\partial t^2} = \\frac{\\partial \\sigma_{ij}}{\\partial x_j}\n$$\nwhere $\\rho$ is the mass density, $u_i(\\mathbf{x}, t)$ is the displacement vector field, and $\\sigma_{ij}$ is the Cauchy stress tensor. The stress is related to the strain $\\varepsilon_{kl} = \\frac{1}{2}(\\partial_k u_l + \\partial_l u_k)$ through the generalized Hooke's law:\n$$\n\\sigma_{ij} = C_{ijkl} \\varepsilon_{kl}\n$$\nwhere $C_{ijkl}$ is the fourth-rank stiffness tensor.\n\nWe seek a plane-wave solution of the form:\n$$\nu_i(\\mathbf{x}, t) = U_i \\exp[i(k n_j x_j - \\omega t)]\n$$\nHere, $U_i$ is the constant polarization vector, $k$ is the wave number, $\\mathbf{n}$ is the unit vector in the direction of propagation, and $\\omega$ is the angular frequency. The phase velocity is $v = \\omega/k$.\n\nSubstituting the plane-wave ansatz into the equation of motion yields the Christoffel equation. First, we compute the derivatives:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial u_i}{\\partial t} = -i\\omega U_i \\exp(\\dots) \\implies \\frac{\\partial^2 u_i}{\\partial t^2} = -\\omega^2 U_i \\exp(\\dots)\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial u_k}{\\partial x_l} = ik n_l U_k \\exp(\\dots) \\implies \\varepsilon_{kl} = \\frac{1}{2} (ik n_l U_k + ik n_k U_l) \\exp(\\dots)\n$$\n$$\n\\sigma_{ij} = C_{ijkl} \\frac{i k}{2} (n_l U_k + n_k U_l) \\exp(\\dots)\n$$\nUsing the major symmetries of the stiffness tensor ($C_{ijkl} = C_{ijlk}$), this simplifies to:\n$$\n\\sigma_{ij} = i k C_{ijkl} n_l U_k \\exp(\\dots)\n$$\nThen, the divergence of stress becomes:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial \\sigma_{ij}}{\\partial x_j} = (i k n_j) (i k C_{ijkl} n_l U_k) \\exp(\\dots) = -k^2 C_{ijkl} n_j n_l U_k \\exp(\\dots)\n$$\nSubstituting these back into the equation of motion:\n$$\n\\rho (-\\omega^2 U_i) \\exp(\\dots) = -k^2 C_{ijkl} n_j n_l U_k \\exp(\\dots)\n$$\nCanceling common terms and rearranging gives:\n$$\n(C_{ijkl} n_j n_l) U_k = \\rho \\frac{\\omega^2}{k^2} U_i = \\rho v^2 U_i\n$$\nThis is the Christoffel eigenvalue equation, $\\Gamma_{ik} U_k = \\rho v^2 U_i$, where the Christoffel matrix $\\Gamma_{ik}$ is defined as $\\Gamma_{ik} = C_{ijkl} n_j n_l$. The eigenvalues $\\lambda = \\rho v^2$ yield the phase velocities of the three possible wave modes for a given propagation direction $\\mathbf{n}$.\n\nFor a cubic crystal, the stiffness tensor $C_{ijkl}$ has only three independent components: $C_{1111}=C_{11}$, $C_{1122}=C_{12}$, and $C_{2323}=C_{44}$ (in Voigt notation). The components of the Christoffel matrix $\\Gamma_{ik}$ for a general propagation direction $\\mathbf{n}=(n_1, n_2, n_3)$ are:\n$$\n\\Gamma_{11} = C_{11} n_1^2 + C_{44} (n_2^2 + n_3^2) = (C_{11}-C_{44})n_1^2 + C_{44} \\\\\n\\Gamma_{22} = C_{11} n_2^2 + C_{44} (n_1^2 + n_3^2) = (C_{11}-C_{44})n_2^2 + C_{44} \\\\\n\\Gamma_{33} = C_{11} n_3^2 + C_{44} (n_1^2 + n_2^2) = (C_{11}-C_{44})n_3^2 + C_{44} \\\\\n\\Gamma_{12} = \\Gamma_{21} = (C_{12} + C_{44}) n_1 n_2 \\\\\n\\Gamma_{13} = \\Gamma_{31} = (C_{12} + C_{44}) n_1 n_3 \\\\\n\\Gamma_{23} = \\Gamma_{32} = (C_{12} + C_{44}) n_2 n_3\n$$\nWe now evaluate this matrix for the specified high-symmetry directions.\n\n1.  Direction $\\mathbf{n} = [100]$, so $n_1=1, n_2=0, n_3=0$.\nThe Christoffel matrix becomes diagonal:\n$$\n\\Gamma = \\begin{pmatrix} C_{11}  0  0 \\\\ 0  C_{44}  0 \\\\ 0  0  C_{44} \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe eigenvalues $\\lambda = \\rho v^2$ are $C_{11}$ and $C_{44}$ (doubly degenerate).\n-   $\\rho v_L^2 = C_{11}$: This corresponds to the longitudinal mode ($L$) with polarization $\\mathbf{U} || [100]$.\n-   $\\rho v_T^2 = C_{44}$: This corresponds to the two degenerate transverse modes ($T$) with polarizations in the plane orthogonal to $[100]$.\nThis yields two linear equations:\n-   $[100], L$: $C_{11} = \\rho v^2$\n-   $[100], T$: $C_{44} = \\rho v^2$\n\n2.  Direction $\\mathbf{n} = [110]$, so $n_1 = 1/\\sqrt{2}, n_2 = 1/\\sqrt{2}, n_3=0$.\nThe Christoffel matrix is:\n$$\n\\Gamma = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{1}{2}(C_{11}+C_{44})  \\frac{1}{2}(C_{12}+C_{44})  0 \\\\ \\frac{1}{2}(C_{12}+C_{44})  \\frac{1}{2}(C_{11}+C_{44})  0 \\\\ 0  0  C_{44} \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nOne eigenvalue is immediately read off: $\\lambda_1 = C_{44}$. The corresponding eigenvector is $[001]$, which is transverse to $[110]$. This is the $T2$ mode.\n-   $\\rho v_{T2}^2 = C_{44}$: This is the transverse mode $T2$ with polarization $\\mathbf{U} || [001]$.\nThe other two eigenvalues are found from the upper-left $2 \\times 2$ block:\n$$\n\\lambda_{2,3} = \\frac{1}{2}(C_{11}+C_{44}) \\pm \\frac{1}{2}(C_{12}+C_{44})\n$$\n-   $\\lambda_L = \\frac{1}{2}(C_{11}+C_{12}+2C_{44})$. The eigenvector is parallel to $[110]$. This is the longitudinal mode ($L$). Thus, $\\rho v_L^2 = \\frac{1}{2} C_{11} + \\frac{1}{2} C_{12} + C_{44}$.\n-   $\\lambda_{T1} = \\frac{1}{2}(C_{11}-C_{12})$. The eigenvector is parallel to $[1\\bar{1}0]$. This is the transverse mode ($T1$). Thus, $\\rho v_{T1}^2 = \\frac{1}{2} C_{11} - \\frac{1}{2} C_{12}$.\nThis yields three linear equations:\n-   $[110], L$: $\\frac{1}{2} C_{11} + \\frac{1}{2} C_{12} + C_{44} = \\rho v^2$\n-   $[110], T1$: $\\frac{1}{2} C_{11} - \\frac{1}{2} C_{12} = \\rho v^2$\n-   $[110], T2$: $C_{44} = \\rho v^2$\n\n3.  Direction $\\mathbf{n} = [111]$, so $n_1 = n_2 = n_3 = 1/\\sqrt{3}$.\nThe Christoffel matrix is symmetric with equal diagonal and equal off-diagonal elements:\n$$\n\\Gamma = \\frac{1}{3} \\begin{pmatrix} C_{11}+2C_{44}  C_{12}+C_{44}  C_{12}+C_{44} \\\\ C_{12}+C_{44}  C_{11}+2C_{44}  C_{12}+C_{44} \\\\ C_{12}+C_{44}  C_{12}+C_{44}  C_{11}+2C_{44} \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe eigenvalues are $\\lambda_L = \\frac{1}{3}(C_{11}+2C_{12}+4C_{44})$ (longitudinal mode, eigenvector parallel to $[111]$) and a degenerate eigenvalue $\\lambda_T = \\frac{1}{3}(C_{11}-C_{12}+C_{44})$ (transverse modes, eigenvectors in the plane orthogonal to $[111]$).\nThis yields two linear equations:\n-   $[111], L$: $\\frac{1}{3} C_{11} + \\frac{2}{3} C_{12} + \\frac{4}{3} C_{44} = \\rho v^2$\n-   $[111], T$: $\\frac{1}{3} C_{11} - \\frac{1}{3} C_{12} + \\frac{1}{3} C_{44} = \\rho v^2$\n\nWe can now construct a linear system $A \\mathbf{x} = \\mathbf{y}$ for the unknown vector $\\mathbf{x} = [C_{11}, C_{12}, C_{44}]^T$. For each measurement $m$ of velocity $v_m$ for a given direction and mode, we have a row in the matrix $A$ and a corresponding entry in the vector $\\mathbf{y}$. Let $y_m = \\rho v_m^2$. The coefficients $(a_m, b_m, c_m)$ for the equation $a_m C_{11} + b_m C_{12} + c_m C_{44} = y_m$ are:\n-   $([100], L)$: $(1, 0, 0)$\n-   $([100], T)$: $(0, 0, 1)$\n-   $([110], L)$: $(1/2, 1/2, 1)$\n-   $([110], T1)$: $(1/2, -1/2, 0)$\n-   $([110], T2)$: $(0, 0, 1)$\n-   $([111], L)$: $(1/3, 2/3, 4/3)$\n-   $([111], T)$: $(1/3, -1/3, 1/3)$\n\nFor each test case, we assemble the matrix $A$ and vector $\\mathbf{y}$ from the provided measurements. Since the system may be overdetermined, we solve for $\\mathbf{x}$ in the least-squares sense, minimizing the Euclidean norm of the residual, $\\|A\\mathbf{x} - \\mathbf{y}\\|_2$. A numerically stable method for this is to use Singular Value Decomposition (SVD), as implemented in `numpy.linalg.lstsq`. The solution vector $\\mathbf{x}$ provides the estimates for $(C_{11}, C_{12}, C_{44})$ in Pascals. These are converted to Gigapascals (GPa) by dividing by $10^9$ and rounding to three decimal places as required.
