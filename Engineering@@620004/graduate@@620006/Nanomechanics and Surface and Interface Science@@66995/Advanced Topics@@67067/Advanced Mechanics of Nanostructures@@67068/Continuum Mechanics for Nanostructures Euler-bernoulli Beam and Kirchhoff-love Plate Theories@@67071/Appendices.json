We proceed with the derivation.\n\n**Derivation of the Governing Equation**\n\n1.  **Kinematics:** According to KL theory, for a small deflection $w(r)$ in axisymmetric polar coordinates, the in-plane displacements $(u_r, u_\\theta)$ at a distance $z$ from the mid-plane are given by the rotation of the normal. The rotation (slope) in the radial direction is $\\phi_r = -\\dfrac{dw}{dr}$.\n    $$u_r(r, z) = z \\phi_r = -z \\dfrac{dw}{dr}$$\n    $$u_\\theta(r, z) = 0 \\quad \\text{(due to axisymmetry)}$$\n    The strain components in polar coordinates are:\n    $$\\varepsilon_{rr} = \\dfrac{\\partial u_r}{\\partial r} = -z \\dfrac{d^2 w}{dr^2}$$\n    $$\\varepsilon_{\\theta\\theta} = \\dfrac{u_r}{r} + \\dfrac{1}{r}\\dfrac{\\partial u_\\theta}{\\partial \\theta} = \\dfrac{-z}{r}\\dfrac{dw}{dr}$$\n    The shear strain $\\varepsilon_{r\\theta}$ is zero due to axisymmetry. Transverse shear strains $\\gamma_{rz}$ and $\\gamma_{\\theta z}$ are assumed to be zero in KL theory.\n\n2.  **Constitutive Relations:** For an isotropic linear elastic material under plane stress conditions ($\\sigma_{zz} = 0$), the stresses are related to the strains by:\n    $$\\sigma_{rr} = \\dfrac{E}{1-\\nu^2}(\\varepsilon_{rr} + \\nu \\varepsilon_{\\theta\\theta}) = -\\dfrac{Ez}{1-\\nu^2}\\left(\\dfrac{d^2 w}{dr^2} + \\dfrac{\\nu}{r}\\dfrac{dw}{dr}\\right)$$\n    $$\\sigma_{\\theta\\theta} = \\dfrac{E}{1-\\nu^2}(\\varepsilon_{\\theta\\theta} + \\nu \\varepsilon_{rr}) = -\\dfrac{Ez}{1-\\nu^2}\\left(\\dfrac{1}{r}\\dfrac{dw}{dr} + \\nu \\dfrac{d^2 w}{dr^2}\\right)$$\n\n3.  **Stress Resultants (Bending Moments):** The bending moments per unit length, $M_r$ and $M_\\theta$, are found by integrating the stresses through the plate thickness $h$:\n    $$M_r = \\int_{-h/2}^{h/2} \\sigma_{rr} z \\, dz = -\\left[\\dfrac{E}{1-\\nu^2}\\int_{-h/2}^{h/2} z^2 \\, dz\\right] \\left(\\dfrac{d^2 w}{dr^2} + \\dfrac{\\nu}{r}\\dfrac{dw}{dr}\\right)$$\n    Using the identity $\\int_{-h/2}^{h/2} z^2 \\, dz = \\dfrac{h^3}{12}$ and the definition of bending rigidity $D = \\dfrac{E h^3}{12(1-\\nu^2)}$, we obtain:\n    $$M_r = -D \\left(\\dfrac{d^2 w}{dr^2} + \\dfrac{\\nu}{r}\\dfrac{dw}{dr}\\right)$$\n    Similarly for the circumferential moment $M_\\theta$:\n    $$M_\\theta = \\int_{-h/2}^{h/2} \\sigma_{\\theta\\theta} z \\, dz = -D \\left(\\dfrac{1}{r}\\dfrac{dw}{dr} + \\nu \\dfrac{d^2 w}{dr^2}\\right)$$\n\n4.  **Equilibrium Equations:** We consider equilibrium for a differential plate element in axisymmetric coordinates.\n    The moment equilibrium equation about the tangential direction is:\n    $$\\dfrac{d(r M_r)}{dr} - M_\\theta - r Q_r = 0$$\n    Here, $Q_r$ is the transverse shear force resultant per unit length.\n    From this, we can express $Q_r$ as:\n    $$Q_r = \\dfrac{1}{r} \\left( \\dfrac{d(r M_r)}{dr} - M_\\theta \\right) = \\dfrac{dM_r}{dr} + \\dfrac{M_r - M_\\theta}{r}$$\n    The transverse force equilibrium equation is:\n    $$\\dfrac{d(r Q_r)}{dr} + r q(r) = 0$$\n    \n5.  **Combining to Form the Governing Equation:** We substitute the expressions for $M_r$ and $M_\\theta$ into the equation for $Q_r$.\n    $$Q_r = -D \\dfrac{d}{dr}\\left(\\dfrac{d^2 w}{dr^2} + \\dfrac{\\nu}{r}\\dfrac{dw}{dr}\\right) - \\dfrac{D}{r} \\left( (1-\\nu)\\dfrac{d^2 w}{dr^2} - \\dfrac{(1-\\nu)}{r}\\dfrac{dw}{dr} \\right)$$\n    A more direct route is to recognize that the term $\\left(\\dfrac{d^2 w}{dr^2} + \\dfrac{1}{r}\\dfrac{dw}{dr}\\right)$ is the axisymmetric Laplacian of $w$, denoted $\\nabla^2 w$.

The problem is therefore deemed valid and a solution will be provided.\n\nThe critical buckling load will be determined using the principle of stationary potential energy. The total potential energy $\\Pi$ of the beam system consists of three parts: the strain energy of bending in the bulk material $U_{bend}$, the change in surface energy on the lateral surfaces due to stretching during buckling $\\Delta U_{surface}$, and the potential of the externally applied compressive load $N$, which is $\\Omega_N$.\n\nThe total potential energy is $\\Pi = U_{bend} + \\Delta U_{surface} + \\Omega_N$.\n\nLet $w(x)$ be the transverse displacement of the beam's neutral axis, where $x$ is the axial coordinate from $x=0$ to $x=L$.

The kinematic assumptions of Kirchhoff-Love plate theory may break down at small scales or for short wavelengths of deformation. This exercise introduces a powerful method to assess the validity of the theory by calculating a dimensionless slenderness parameter, helping you determine when a more refined model that includes transverse shear deformation is necessary [@problem_id:2767413].", "problem": "Consider a monocrystalline silicon nanoplate of uniform thickness $h=20\\,\\text{nm}$ that supports a time-harmonic, sinusoidal out-of-plane flexural mode with in-plane wavelength $\\lambda=2\\,\\mu\\text{m}$ propagating along the $x$-direction. Starting from three-dimensional small-strain kinematics and the kinematic hypothesis underlying Kirchhoff-Love (KL) plate theory that material normals to the mid-surface remain straight and normal after deformation (thus implying vanishing transverse shear strains $\\gamma_{xz}$ and $\\gamma_{yz}$ in the thin-plate limit), use asymptotic reasoning for a sinusoidal deflection field $w(x,t)=\\Re\\{\\hat{w}\\exp[i(kx-\\omega t)]\\}$ to identify the leading non-dimensional parameter $\\eta$ that controls the relative importance of neglected transverse shear deformation compared to bending. Here $k$ denotes the in-plane wavenumber related to the wavelength by $k=2\\pi/\\lambda$. Evaluate this parameter $\\eta$ for the given $h$ and $\\lambda$, and based on its magnitude, assess whether the Kirchhoff-Love description is admissible for this mode in the thin-plate (long-wavelength) sense. Report the value of $\\eta$ as a dimensionless number with three significant figures and provide no units in your reported value. You may assume the plate is homogeneous and that material anisotropy affects bending stiffness but not the form of the long-wave slenderness parameter that governs the validity of the Kirchhoff-Love hypothesis.", "solution": "The Kirchhoff-Love (KL) plate hypothesis posits that straight lines initially normal to the mid-surface remain straight and normal after deformation and experience no extension. In small-strain kinematics, this implies that the transverse shear strain components satisfy $\\gamma_{xz}=0$ and $\\gamma_{yz}=0$ within the plate model. In three-dimensional elasticity, the exact solution for a bending mode exhibits small but nonzero transverse shear strains due to through-thickness warping, which are neglected in KL theory. The admissibility of the KL description is governed by a slenderness parameter that quantifies the magnitude of the neglected shear relative to bending.\n\nConsider a sinusoidal deflection $w(x,t)=\\Re\\{\\hat{w}\\exp[i(kx-\\omega t)]\\}$ with wavenumber $k=2\\pi/\\lambda$. The KL kinematics relate in-plane displacements to the transverse deflection by\n$$\nu_x(x,z,t)=-z\\,\\frac{\\partial w}{\\partial x},\\qquad u_y(x,z,t)=-z\\,\\frac{\\partial w}{\\partial y},\\qquad u_z(x,z,t)=w(x,t),\n$$\nwhere $z$ is the through-thickness coordinate measured from the mid-surface. Under these kinematics,\n$$\n\\gamma_{xz}=\\frac{\\partial u_x}{\\partial z}+\\frac{\\partial w}{\\partial x}=-\\frac{\\partial w}{\\partial x}+\\frac{\\partial w}{\\partial x}=0,\\qquad\n\\gamma_{yz}=\\frac{\\partial u_y}{\\partial z}+\\frac{\\partial w}{\\partial y}=0.\n$$\nHowever, when one solves the three-dimensional elasticity problem or uses a shear-deformable plate theory such as Mindlin-Reissner, the actual transverse shear strain is small but nonzero and arises from the mismatch between the rotation field and the slope $\\partial w/\\partial x$. For long waves in thin plates, asymptotic analysis shows that the deviation of the rotation from the slope, and hence the transverse shear strain, scales with the non-dimensional combination $k h$:\n$$\n\\gamma_{xz}\\sim \\mathcal{O}\\big((k h)^{2}\\,k\\,\\hat{w}\\big),\\qquad \\text{while}\\qquad \\epsilon_{xx}\\sim \\mathcal{O}\\big(h\\,k^{2}\\,\\hat{w}\\big).\n$$\nConsequently, the ratio of the neglected transverse shear contribution to the dominant bending contribution in the energy (or equivalently, the error induced by enforcing $\\gamma_{xz}=\\gamma_{yz}=0$) is $\\mathcal{O}\\big((k h)^{2}\\big)$. The leading-order non-dimensional parameter governing the validity of the KL hypothesis is therefore\n$$\n\\eta = k h = \\frac{2\\pi h}{\\lambda}.\n$$\n\nWe now evaluate $\\eta$ for the given data.
