Lateral surfaces are free of higher-order tractions.\n-   Objective: Derive a closed-form analytical expression for the peak torque amplitude, $\\widehat{T}$, as a function of $d$, $G$, $\\ell_{g}$, $\\ell_{nl}$, $k$, and $\\Theta_{0}$.\n-   Allowed information: Polar moment of area $J$ and area $A$ for a circle can be used without derivation.\n\n**Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens**\n-   **Scientific Grounding**: The problem employs established, albeit simplified, theoretical models from nanomechanics, namely Eringen's nonlocal elasticity and a form of strain gradient elasticity. These are not speculative and are commonly used to model size effects in small-scale structures. The problem is scientifically sound.\n-   **Well-Posedness**: The geometry, material properties, kinematics, and constitutive laws are explicitly defined. The loading is specified. The objective is to find the resultant torque, which is a standard procedure in mechanics. The problem is self-contained and well-posed.\n-   **Objectivity**: The problem is stated in precise, technical language, free from subjective or ambiguous terms.\n-   **Conclusion**: The problem does not violate any of the invalidity criteria. It is a valid, solvable problem in continuum mechanics.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. A complete solution will be provided.\n\n**Derivation of the Solution**\nThe total internal torque $T(x)$ is the thermodynamic quantity work-conjugate to the twist rate $\\kappa(x)$. The problem statement implies that the total response is a superposition of effects from the nonlocal Cauchy stress and the strain gradient energy. We can therefore express the total torque as the sum of a torque arising from the nonlocal mechanism, $T_{nl}(x)$, and a torque arising from the strain gradient mechanism, $T_{sg}(x)$.\n$$ T(x) = T_{nl}(x) + T_{sg}(x) $$\n\nFirst, we determine the kinematics from the prescribed rotation field.\nThe rotation angle is given as $\\theta(x) = \\Theta_{0}\\sin(kx)$.\nThe twist rate, $\\kappa(x)$, is its derivative with respect to the axial coordinate $x$:\n$$ \\kappa(x) = \\frac{d\\theta}{dx} = k\\Theta_{0}\\cos(kx) $$\nThe shear strain is $\\gamma(r,x) = r\\kappa(x) = rk\\Theta_{0}\\cos(kx)$.\n\n**1. Torque from Nonlocal Cauchy Stress, $T_{nl}(x)$**\nThe torque due to the Cauchy stress $\\tau(r,x)$ is found by integrating the moment of the stress over the cross-sectional area $A$:\n$$ T_{nl}(x) = \\int_{A} r \\tau(r,x) dA $$\nThe Cauchy stress $\\tau(r,x)$ is determined by the nonlocal constitutive relation:\n$$ \\left(1 - \\ell_{nl}^{2}\\,\\frac{\\partial^{2}}{\\partial x^{2}}\\right)\\,\\tau(r,x) = G\\,\\gamma(r,x) = G r k \\Theta_{0} \\cos(kx) $$\nWe are solving a differential equation for $\\tau(r,x)$. Given the form of the right-hand side, we assume a solution of the form $\\tau(r,x) = \\hat{\\tau}(r)\\cos(kx)$. Substituting this into the equation:\n$$ \\hat{\\tau}(r)\\cos(kx) - \\ell_{nl}^{2} \\hat{\\tau}(r) (-k^{2}\\cos(kx)) = G r k \\Theta_{0} \\cos(kx) $$\n$$ \\hat{\\tau}(r)(1 + k^{2}\\ell_{nl}^{2})\\cos(kx) = G r k \\Theta_{0} \\cos(kx) $$\nSolving for the stress amplitude $\\hat{\\tau}(r)$:\n$$ \\hat{\\tau}(r) = \\frac{G r k \\Theta_{0}}{1 + k^{2}\\ell_{nl}^{2}} $$\nThus, the Cauchy stress is:\n$$ \\tau(r,x) = \\frac{G r k \\Theta_{0}}{1 + k^{2}\\ell_{nl}^{2}}\\cos(kx) = \\frac{G r \\kappa(x)}{1 + k^{2}\\ell_{nl}^{2}} $$\nNow, we compute the torque $T_{nl}(x)$:\n$$ T_{nl}(x) = \\int_{A} r \\left( \\frac{G r \\kappa(x)}{1 + k^{2}\\ell_{nl}^{2}} \\right) dA = \\frac{G\\kappa(x)}{1 + k^{2}\\ell_{nl}^{2}} \\int_{A} r^{2} dA $$\nThe integral $\\int_{A} r^{2} dA$ is the polar moment of area, $J$. So,\n$$ T_{nl}(x) = \\frac{G J}{1 + k^{2}\\ell_{nl}^{2}} \\kappa(x) $$\n\n**2. Torque from Strain Gradient Energy, $T_{sg}(x)$**\nThe strain gradient contribution to the potential energy is given by integrating the energy density $W_{\\text{grad}}$ over the volume of the nanowire. The energy per unit length is:\n$$ U_{sg, section}(x) = \\int_{A} W_{\\text{grad}} dA = \\int_{A} \\frac{1}{2} G \\ell_{g}^{2} |\\nabla_{s}\\gamma|^{2} dA $$\nWe must first compute the in-plane gradient of the shear strain, $\\nabla_{s}\\gamma$. In polar coordinates $(r, \\phi)$ on the cross-section, $\\gamma = r\\kappa(x)$ is only a function of $r$. The gradient is:\n$$ \\nabla_{s}\\gamma = \\frac{\\partial \\gamma}{\\partial r} \\mathbf{e}_{r} + \\frac{1}{r}\\frac{\\partial \\gamma}{\\partial \\phi} \\mathbf{e}_{\\phi} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial r}(r\\kappa(x)) \\mathbf{e}_{r} = \\kappa(x) \\mathbf{e}_{r} $$\nThe squared magnitude is $|\\nabla_{s}\\gamma|^{2} = (\\kappa(x))^{2}$.\nSubstituting this into the energy expression:\n$$ U_{sg, section}(x) = \\int_{A} \\frac{1}{2} G \\ell_{g}^{2} (\\kappa(x))^{2} dA = \\frac{1}{2} G \\ell_{g}^{2} (\\kappa(x))^{2} \\int_{A} dA = \\frac{1}{2} G A \\ell_{g}^{2} (\\kappa(x))^{2} $$\nThe torque is the work conjugate to the twist, so we can find it by taking the derivative of the sectional energy with respect to $\\kappa$:\n$$ T_{sg}(x) = \\frac{\\partial U_{sg, section}}{\\partial \\kappa} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\kappa} \\left( \\frac{1}{2} G A \\ell_{g}^{2} (\\kappa(x))^{2} \\right) = G A \\ell_{g}^{2} \\kappa(x) $$\n\n**3. Total Torque and its Amplitude**\nThe total torque $T(x)$ is the sum of the two contributions:\n$$ T(x) = T_{nl}(x) + T_{sg}(x) = \\frac{G J}{1 + k^{2}\\ell_{nl}^{2}} \\kappa(x) + G A \\ell_{g}^{2} \\kappa(x) $$\n$$ T(x) = G \\left( \\frac{J}{1 + k^{2}\\ell_{nl}^{2}} + A\\ell_{g}^{2} \\right) \\kappa(x) $$\nSubstituting $\\kappa(x) = k\\Theta_{0}\\cos(kx)$:\n$$ T(x) = G k \\Theta_{0} \\left( \\frac{J}{1 + k^{2}\\ell_{nl}^{2}} + A\\ell_{g}^{2} \\right) \\cos(kx) $$\nThe problem asks for the peak torque amplitude, $\\widehat{T}$, which is the maximum value of $T(x)$. This occurs when $\\cos(kx)=1$:\n$$ \\widehat{T} = G k \\Theta_{0} \\left( \\frac{J}{1 + k^{2}\\ell_{nl}^{2}} + A\\ell_{g}^{2} \\right) $$\nFinally, we substitute the expressions for the area $A$ and polar moment of area $J$ for a circular cross-section of diameter $d$. The radius is $R=d/2$.\n$$ A = \\pi R^{2} = \\frac{\\pi d^{2}}{4} $$\n$$ J = \\frac{\\pi R^{4}}{2} = \\frac{\\pi (d/2)^{4}}{2} = \\frac{\\pi d^{4}}{32} $$\nSubstituting these into the expression for $\\widehat{T}$:\n$$ \\widehat{T} = G k \\Theta_{0} \\left( \\frac{\\pi d^{4}}{32(1 + k^{2}\\ell_{nl}^{2})} + \\frac{\\pi d^{2}\\ell_{g}^{2}}{4} \\right) $$\nThis is the final closed-form expression for the peak torque amplitude.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{G k \\Theta_{0} \\left( \\frac{\\pi d^{4}}{32(1 + k^{2}\\ell_{nl}^{2})} + \\frac{\\pi d^{2} \\ell_{g}^{2}}{4} \\right)}$$", "id": "2781985"}]}
