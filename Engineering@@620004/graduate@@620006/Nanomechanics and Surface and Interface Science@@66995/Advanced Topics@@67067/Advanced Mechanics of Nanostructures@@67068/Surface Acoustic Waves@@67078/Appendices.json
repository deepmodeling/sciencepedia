Therefore, the new synchronous center frequency, $f$, is determined by the new phase velocity $v$:\n$$f = \\frac{v}{\\lambda}$$\n\nThe shift in the electrical center frequency, $\\Delta f$, is the difference between the new frequency $f$ and the original frequency $f_{0}$:\n$$\\Delta f = f - f_{0}$$\nSubstituting the expressions for $f$ and $f_{0}$:\n$$\\Delta f = \\frac{v}{\\lambda} - \\frac{v_{0}}{\\lambda} = \\frac{v - v_{0}}{\\lambda}$$\nRecognizing that $v - v_{0} = \\Delta v$, we have:\n$$\\Delta f = \\frac{\\Delta v}{\\lambda}$$\nWe can express $\\Delta v$ from the sensitivity relation as $\\Delta v = -v_{0} S_{g} m'$. Substituting this into the equation for $\\Delta f$:\n$$\\Delta f = \\frac{-v_{0} S_{g} m'}{\\lambda}$$\nSince the initial frequency is $f_{0} = v_{0} / \\lambda$, we can rewrite the frequency shift in terms of $f_{0}$:\n$$\\Delta f = -\\left(\\frac{v_{0}}{\\lambda}\\right) S_{g} m' = -f_{0} S_{g} m'$$\nThis is the derived first-order relationship for the frequency shift due to mass loading. Now, we will compute the numerical value.\n\nFirst, calculate the unperturbed center frequency $f_{0}$:\n$$f_{0} = \\frac{v_{0}}{\\lambda} = \\frac{3990 \\ \\text{m/s}}{8.00 \\times 10^{-6} \\ \\text{m}} = 498.75 \\times 10^{6} \\ \\text{Hz} = 4.9875 \\times 10^{8} \\ \\text{Hz}$$\n\nNext, use the derived formula to calculate the frequency shift $\\Delta f$:\n$$\\Delta f = -f_{0} S_{g} m' = -(4.9875 \\times 10^{8} \\ \\text{Hz}) (10.0 \\ \\text{m}^{2}/\\text{kg}) (5.00 \\times 10^{-7} \\ \\text{kg/m}^{2})$$\nPerforming the multiplication:\n$$\\Delta f = -(4.9875 \\times 10^{8}) (50.0 \\times 10^{-7}) \\ \\text{Hz}$$\n$$\\Delta f = -(4.9875 \\times 10^{8}) (5.00 \\times 10^{-6}) \\ \\text{Hz}$$\n$$\\Delta f = - (4.9875 \\times 5.00) \\times 10^{2} \\ \\text{Hz}$$\n$$\\Delta f = -24.9375 \\times 10^{2} \\ \\text{Hz}$$\n$$\\Delta f = -2493.75 \\ \\text{Hz}$$\n\nThe problem requires the final answer to be rounded to four significant figures. The calculated value is -2493.75 Hz. Rounding to four significant figures gives -2494 Hz. The propagation length $L$ was not required for this calculation, as expected.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{-2494}$$", "id": "2789553"}]}
