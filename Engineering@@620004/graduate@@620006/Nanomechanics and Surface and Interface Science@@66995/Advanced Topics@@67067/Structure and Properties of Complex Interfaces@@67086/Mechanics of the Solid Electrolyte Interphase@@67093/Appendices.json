The provided material properties for silicon and the geometric parameters are realistic for such an experiment. The problem is well-posed, objective, and self-contained, with sufficient data to determine a unique solution. It is directly relevant to the nanomechanics of interfaces. The condition $h_f = 30 \\ \\mathrm{nm} \\ll h_s = 500 \\ \\mu\\mathrm{m}$ is clearly satisfied, justifying the use of thin-film approximations. Therefore, the problem is valid.\n\nWe now proceed to the solution. The relationship between the stress in the thin film and the curvature of the substrate is derived from mechanical equilibrium.\n\nThe intrinsic stress $\\sigma_{\\mathrm{SEI}}$ within the thin film exerts a force per unit width, $F_f$, on the substrate. Assuming the stress is uniform through the film thickness $h_f$, this force is:\n$$F_f = \\sigma_{\\mathrm{SEI}} h_f$$\n\nThis force acts at the mid-plane of the film. Due to the condition $h_f \\ll h_s$, the neutral axis of bending for the composite bilayer can be approximated as the mid-plane of the substrate. The force $F_f$ thus acts at a lever arm distance of approximately $d \\approx \\frac{h_s}{2}$ from this neutral axis. This creates a bending moment per unit width, $M$, applied to the substrate:\n$$M = F_f \\cdot d \\approx (\\sigma_{\\mathrm{SEI}} h_f) \\left(\\frac{h_s}{2}\\right)$$\n\nThis applied moment causes the substrate to bend, and it is counteracted by an internal resisting moment generated by the bending stresses within the substrate itself. For an isotropic plate subjected to equi-biaxial bending, the relationship between the internal bending moment $M$ and the resulting curvature $\\kappa$ is given by classical plate theory:\n$$M = \\mathcal{D} \\kappa$$\nwhere $\\mathcal{D}$ is the flexural rigidity of the plate per unit width. For equi-biaxial conditions, the appropriate flexural rigidity is:\n$$\\mathcal{D} = \\frac{E_s h_s^3}{12(1-\\nu_s)}$$\nThe term $M_s = \\frac{E_s}{1-\\nu_s}$ is defined in the problem as the equi-biaxial modulus of the substrate. Using this definition, the flexural rigidity can be written as:\n$$\\mathcal{D} = \\frac{M_s h_s^3}{12}$$\n\nBy equating the applied moment from the film stress to the internal resisting moment of the substrate, we establish the equilibrium condition. We use the measured residual curvature $\\kappa_{\\mathrm{res}}$:\n$$\\sigma_{\\mathrm{SEI}} \\frac{h_f h_s}{2} = \\frac{M_s h_s^3}{12} \\kappa_{\\mathrm{res}}$$\n\nThe problem states the curvature is concave towards the SEI-coated side. By standard convention, this corresponds to a positive curvature, $\\kappa_{\\mathrm{res}} > 0$. Such curvature is induced by a compressive stress in the film, meaning $\\sigma_{\\mathrm{SEI}} < 0$. The problem asks for the magnitude of the stress, $|\\sigma_{\\mathrm{SEI}}|$. We solve for this quantity:\n$$|\\sigma_{\\mathrm{SEI}}| = \\frac{M_s h_s^3 \\kappa_{\\mathrm{res}}}{12} \\cdot \\frac{2}{h_f h_s}$$\n$$|\\sigma_{\\mathrm{SEI}}| = \\frac{M_s h_s^2}{6 h_f} \\kappa_{\\mathrm{res}}$$\nThis is the well-known Stoney equation for biaxial stress.\n\nWe now substitute the given numerical values into this expression.

At high rates, the SEI may not have time to relax and will behave like a brittle elastic solid, while at slow rates, viscous or diffusive flow can accommodate strain. This practice delves into this time-dependent behavior by comparing the characteristic timescale of electrochemical forcing, set by the battery's C-rate, against the intrinsic relaxation timescales of the material, governed by viscoelastic flow and diffusion. By defining and calculating a critical C-rate, we can delineate the regimes of elastic versus viscoelastic response, providing crucial insight into rate-dependent degradation mechanisms.

It is scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and contains all necessary information for a unique solution. We will proceed with the derivation.\n\nThe problem requires the derivation of a critical C-rate, denoted as $C^{\\star}$, which marks the transition between predominantly elastic and viscoelastic responses of the Solid Electrolyte Interphase (SEI) layer in a lithium-ion cell. This transition occurs when the timescale of the electrochemical forcing equals the fastest available internal stress relaxation timescale of the SEI.\n\nThe derivation proceeds in three steps: first, we define the characteristic timescales for the three processes involved: viscoelastic relaxation, diffusion-mediated relaxation, and electrochemical forcing. Second, we establish the dominant (fastest) internal relaxation mechanism. Third, we equate the forcing timescale to this dominant relaxation timescale to solve for the critical C-rate $C^{\\star}$.\n\n1.  **Defining the Characteristic Timescales**\n\n    a.  **Viscoelastic Relaxation Time ($\\tau$)**: The SEI is modeled as a single-mode Maxwell viscoelastic solid, which consists of a purely elastic spring (representing the solid-like response) and a purely viscous dashpot (representing the fluid-like response) connected in series. The shear modulus of the spring is $G$ and the viscosity of the dashpot is $\\eta$. For such a material, the characteristic stress relaxation time, $\\tau$, is defined as the ratio of its viscosity to its shear modulus.\n    $$\n    \\tau = \\frac{\\eta}{G}\n    $$\n    This is the time required for the stress in the material to decay to $1/e$ of its initial value after a step strain is applied.\n\n    b.  **Diffusion-Mediated Relaxation Time ($t_{D}$)**: Stress can also relax through the rearrangement of constituent species (e.g., atoms, molecules, defects) within the SEI layer via diffusion. The characteristic time for a diffusive process to occur across a length scale $L$ is given by the Fickian diffusion scaling law. Here, the relevant length scale is the thickness of the SEI film, $L$. The diffusion coefficient is given as $D_{\\mathrm{SEI}}$. The diffusion time, $t_{D}$, is therefore:\n    $$\n    t_{D} = \\frac{L^2}{D_{\\mathrm{SEI}}}\n    $$\n    This expression provides an order-of-magnitude estimate for the time required for species to traverse the film thickness, enabling structural rearrangements that relax mechanical stress.\n\n    c.  **Electrochemical Forcing Timescale ($t_{\\mathrm{echem}}$)**: The C-rate, denoted by $C$, is a measure of the rate at which a battery is charged or discharged relative to its maximum capacity. A C-rate of $1$ C means that the entire battery capacity is discharged in $1$ hour. Generally, for a C-rate of $C$, the total time for a full charge or discharge is $1/C$ hours. This period represents the characteristic timescale of the electrochemical process, $t_{\\mathrm{echem}}$, which induces strain in the electrode and the SEI. To maintain consistency of units (seconds), we convert hours to seconds ($1\\ \\text{hour} = 3600\\ \\text{s}$).\n    $$\n    t_{\\mathrm{echem}} = \\frac{1}{C} \\text{ hours} = \\frac{3600}{C} \\text{ seconds}\n    $$\n\n2.  **Identifying the Fastest Internal Relaxation Timescale ($t_{\\mathrm{relax}}$)**\n\n    The problem states that stress relaxation occurs through two primary pathways: viscoelastic flow (timescale $\\tau$) and diffusion-mediated rearrangements (timescale $t_D$). These are independent, parallel processes. When multiple parallel pathways for relaxation exist, the overall rate of relaxation is dominated by the fastest pathway, which corresponds to the shortest timescale. Therefore, the effective internal relaxation time of the SEI, $t_{\\mathrm{relax}}$, is the minimum of the two individual timescales.\n    $$\n    t_{\\mathrm{relax}} = \\min(\\tau, t_{D}) = \\min\\left(\\frac{\\eta}{G}, \\frac{L^2}{D_{\\mathrm{SEI}}}\\right)\n    $$\n\n3.  **Deriving and Computing the Critical C-rate ($C^{\\star}$)**\n\n    The critical C-rate, $C^{\\star}$, is defined at the crossover point where the electrochemical forcing timescale equals the fastest internal relaxation timescale. At this point, the Deborah number, $De = t_{\\mathrm{relax}}/t_{\\mathrm{echem}}$, is unity.\n    $$\n    t_{\\mathrm{echem}}(C^{\\star}) = t_{\\mathrm{relax}}\n    $$\n    Substituting the expressions for the timescales, we get:\n    $$\n    \\frac{3600}{C^{\\star}} = \\min\\left(\\frac{\\eta}{G}, \\frac{L^2}{D_{\\mathrm{SEI}}}\\right)\n    $$\n    Solving for $C^{\\star}$ yields the final analytical expression:\n    $$\n    C^{\\star} = \\frac{3600}{\\min\\left(\\frac{\\eta}{G}, \\frac{L^2}{D_{\\mathrm{SEI}}}\\right)}\n    $$\n    Now, we substitute the given numerical values to compute $C^{\\star}$.
