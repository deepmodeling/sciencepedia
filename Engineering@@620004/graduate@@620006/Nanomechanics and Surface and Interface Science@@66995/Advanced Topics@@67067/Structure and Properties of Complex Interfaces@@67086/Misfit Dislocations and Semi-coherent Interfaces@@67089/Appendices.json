The coordinate system $(x, y, z)$ is aligned with the crystal axes $[100]$, $[010]$, and $[001]$, respectively, due to the $(001)$ orientation of the film.\n\nThe stress-strain relations (Hooke's law) for a cubic crystal, considering only the normal components, are:\n$$\n\\sigma_{xx} = C_{11}\\varepsilon_{xx} + C_{12}\\varepsilon_{yy} + C_{12}\\varepsilon_{zz}\n$$\n$$\n\\sigma_{yy} = C_{12}\\varepsilon_{xx} + C_{11}\\varepsilon_{yy} + C_{12}\\varepsilon_{zz}\n$$\n$$\n\\sigma_{zz} = C_{12}\\varepsilon_{xx} + C_{12}\\varepsilon_{yy} + C_{11}\\varepsilon_{zz}\n$$\nThe problem specifies a state of uniform biaxial strain in the plane of the film:\n$$\n\\varepsilon_{xx} = \\varepsilon_{yy} = f\n$$\nAll shear strain components are zero ($\\varepsilon_{xy} = \\varepsilon_{yz} = \\varepsilon_{zx} = 0$), which implies all shear stress components are also zero. Due to symmetry, the in-plane normal stresses must be equal: $\\sigma_{xx} = \\sigma_{yy} = \\sigma$.\n\nThe condition of plane stress is imposed, meaning there is no stress component normal to the film surface:\n$$\n\\sigma_{zz} = 0\n$$\nWe use this condition to find the resulting strain in the $z$-direction, $\\varepsilon_{zz}$. Substituting the in-plane strains and $\\sigma_{zz}=0$ into the third stress-strain equation:\n$$\n0 = C_{12}f + C_{12}f + C_{11}\\varepsilon_{zz} = 2C_{12}f + C_{11}\\varepsilon_{zz}\n$$\nSolving for $\\varepsilon_{zz}$ gives:\n$$\n\\varepsilon_{zz} = -\\frac{2C_{12}}{C_{11}}f\n$$\nThis shows that the film contracts or expands in the thickness direction to maintain a zero-stress state.

By comparison, we identify the expression for $M$:\n$$\nM = C_{11} + C_{12} - \\frac{2C_{12}^2}{C_{11}}\n$$\nNext, we derive the coherent elastic energy per unit area, $U_{\\text{coh}}$. The elastic strain energy density, $u$, is given by $u = \\frac{1}{2}\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}:\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon} = \\frac{1}{2}\\sum_{ij}\\sigma_{ij}\\varepsilon_{ij}$. For this case, the non-zero components lead to:\n$$\nu = \\frac{1}{2}(\\sigma_{xx}\\varepsilon_{xx} + \\sigma_{yy}\\varepsilon_{yy} + \\sigma_{zz}\\varepsilon_{zz})\n$$\nSince $\\sigma_{zz}=0$, and $\\sigma_{xx}=\\sigma_{yy}=\\sigma$, and $\\varepsilon_{xx}=\\varepsilon_{yy}=f$:\n$$\nu = \\frac{1}{2}(\\sigma f + \\sigma f) = \\sigma f\n$$\nSubstituting $\\sigma = Mf$, the energy density becomes:\n$$\nu = (Mf)f = Mf^2\n$$\nThe total coherent elastic energy per unit area, $U_{\\text{coh}}$, is obtained by integrating the uniform energy density $u$ through the film thickness $h$:\n$$\nU_{\\text{coh}} = \\int_{0}^{h} u \\,dz = u \\int_{0}^{h} dz = uh\n$$\nThus, the expression for the coherent elastic energy per unit area is:\n$$\nU_{\\text{coh}} = Mf^2h = \\left( C_{11} + C_{12} - \\frac{2C_{12}^2}{C_{11}} \\right)f^2h\n$$\nFinally, we evaluate $U_{\\text{coh}}$ using the provided numerical values.

The given numerical values are physically realistic for a small-misfit epitaxial system. All criteria for a valid problem are met.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. A complete solution will be provided.\n\n**Derivation of Dislocation Spacing $D$**\n\nThe fundamental principle governing the formation of a semi-coherent interface is that the strain arising from the lattice mismatch between two crystals is accommodated by a periodic array of misfit dislocations. For full relaxation, the cumulative plastic displacement introduced by the dislocations must precisely cancel the cumulative mismatch strain over a given length.\n\nThe lattice mismatch, or misfit strain, $f$, is defined as $f = \\frac{a_{f}-a_{s}}{a_{s}}$. For a cubic system where the film attempts to grow epitaxially on the substrate, this strain is initially uniform in the interface plane. Thus, the misfit along the $[110]$ direction is also $f$.\n\nConsider a line segment of length $L$ in the substrate along the $[110]$ direction. If the film were unconstrained, its corresponding length would be $L_{f} = L(1+f)$. To fit the film onto the substrate, a total compressive displacement of $\\Delta L = L_{f} - L = Lf$ must be accommodated over the length $L$. The problem states this accommodation is achieved entirely by the misfit dislocation array.\n\nThe dislocations are arranged periodically with a spacing $D$ measured perpendicular to the dislocation lines. The dislocation lines are along $[\\bar{1}10]$. The direction in the $(001)$ interface plane perpendicular to $[\\bar{1}10]$ is $[110]$. Therefore, the spacing $D$ is measured along the $[110]$ direction. The number of dislocations, $N$, over the length $L$ is given by $N = \\frac{L}{D}$.\n\nEach dislocation introduces a plastic displacement characterized by its Burgers vector, $\\mathbf{b}$. The component of the Burgers vector that is effective in relieving mismatch strain is its edge component projected onto the interface, herein denoted as $b_{edge}$. The total plastic displacement provided by $N$ dislocations is $N b_{edge}$.\n\nEquating the total mismatch displacement to the total plastic displacement for full relaxation yields:\n$$ Lf = N b_{edge} = \\left(\\frac{L}{D}\\right)b_{edge} $$\nFor a non-zero length $L$, we can divide by $L$ to obtain the fundamental relation for dislocation spacing:\n$$ D = \\frac{b_{edge}}{f} $$\nNext, we must determine the magnitude of the effective edge component, $b_{edge}$. The Burgers vector is given as $\\mathbf{b} = \\frac{a_{f}}{2}[110]$, and the dislocation line direction is $\\mathbf{l}$ along $[\\bar{1}10]$. A pure edge dislocation is defined by the condition that its Burgers vector is perpendicular to its line direction ($\\mathbf{b} \\perp \\mathbf{l}$). We verify this condition:\n$$ \\mathbf{b} \\cdot \\mathbf{l} \\propto [110] \\cdot [\\bar{1}10] = (1)(-1) + (1)(1) + (0)(0) = -1 + 1 = 0 $$\nThe condition is satisfied. The dislocation is indeed pure edge. Furthermore, the Burgers vector $\\mathbf{b} = \\frac{a_{f}}{2}[110]$ has no component along the $[001]$ direction (the direction normal to the interface), so it lies entirely within the $(001)$ interface plane.\n\nSince the entire Burgers vector is perpendicular to the dislocation line and lies in the interface, the effective edge component $b_{edge}$ is simply the magnitude of the Burgers vector itself:\n$$ b_{edge} = |\\mathbf{b}| = \\left|\\frac{a_{f}}{2}[110]\\right| = \\frac{a_{f}}{2}\\sqrt{1^{2} + 1^{2} + 0^{2}} = \\frac{a_{f}\\sqrt{2}}{2} = \\frac{a_{f}}{\\sqrt{2}} $$\nSubstituting this expression for $b_{edge}$ into our equation for $D$, we arrive at the required dislocation spacing in terms of $a_{f}$ and $f$:\n$$ D = \\frac{1}{f} \\left(\\frac{a_{f}}{\\sqrt{2}}\\right) = \\frac{a_{f}}{f\\sqrt{2}} $$\n\n**Numerical Calculation**\n\nWe are given the lattice parameters $a_{s}=0.400\\,\\text{nm}$ and $a_{f}=0.408\\,\\text{nm}$.\n\nFirst, we calculate the numerical value of the misfit, $f$:\n$$ f = \\frac{a_{f} - a_{s}}{a_{s}} = \\frac{0.408 - 0.400}{0.400} = \\frac{0.008}{0.400} = 0.02 $$\nThe misfit is a dimensionless quantity.\n\nNow, we compute the dislocation spacing $D$ using the derived formula:\n$$ D = \\frac{a_{f}}{f\\sqrt{2}} = \\frac{0.408\\,\\text{nm}}{0.02 \\times \\sqrt{2}} $$\n$$ D = \\frac{20.4}{\\sqrt{2}}\\,\\text{nm} = 10.2\\sqrt{2}\\,\\text{nm} $$\nFinally, we calculate the numerical value and round to three significant figures, as requested:\n$$ D \\approx 10.2 \\times 1.414213... \\,\\text{nm} \\approx 14.4249... \\,\\text{nm} $$\nRounding to three significant figures gives:\n$$ D \\approx 14.4\\,\\text{nm} $$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{14.4}$$", "id": "2779831"}, {"introduction": "In practice, a thin film rarely remains fully strained or becomes fully relaxed; instead, it settles into a lower-energy, partially relaxed state.

This signifies the onset of dislocation formation; at the critical thickness, the spacing between dislocations is infinite.\nAs $h$ increases beyond $h_c$, the denominator increases, causing $D^*$ to decrease monotonically.\nIn the limit of a very thick film ($h \\to \\infty$), the term $\\Gamma$ in the denominator becomes negligible compared to $M h f b$. The expression for $D^*$ asymptotically approaches:\n$$\\lim_{h\\to\\infty} D^*(h) = \\lim_{h\\to\\infty} \\frac{M h b^2}{M h f b - \\Gamma} = \\lim_{h\\to\\infty} \\frac{b^2}{f b - \\Gamma/(Mh)} = \\frac{b}{f}$$\nThis asymptotic spacing $D^* = b/f$ is precisely the spacing required to completely relax the misfit strain $f$, as it results in a residual strain of $\\varepsilon_r = f - b/D^* = f - b/(b/f) = 0$. Thus, for very thick films, the system minimizes its enormous elastic energy by forming a dislocation network that fully accommodates the lattice mismatch.\nIn summary, $D^*$ is a monotonically decreasing function of $h$ for $h > h_c$, starting from infinity at $h = h_c$ and approaching a constant value $b/f$ for large $h$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{13.51}\n$$", "id": "2779813"}]}
