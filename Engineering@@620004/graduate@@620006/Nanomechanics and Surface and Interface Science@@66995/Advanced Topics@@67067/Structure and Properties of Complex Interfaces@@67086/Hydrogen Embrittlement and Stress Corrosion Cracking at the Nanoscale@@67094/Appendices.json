The hydrogen chemical potential imposed by the electrochemical boundary condition at $x=0$ corresponds to a hypothetical lattice concentration $c_{\\mathrm{eq}}$ that would prevail at the interface in the absence of any kinetic limitation. Interfacial incorporation of hydrogen into the metal is governed by first-order kinetics, so the entry flux $J$ at $x=0$ satisfies $J = k(c_{\\mathrm{eq}} - c_{s})$, where $k$ is the kinetic coefficient and $c_{s}=c(0)$ is the near-surface lattice concentration.

The governing equations—Fick's first law and a first-order kinetic boundary condition—are standard models used in materials science and electrochemistry to describe hydrogen permeation in metals. The concept is directly relevant to hydrogen embrittlement studies.\n- **Well-Posed**: The problem is a well-posed one-dimensional boundary value problem. It involves a second-order ordinary differential equation (derived from steady-state mass conservation and Fick's law) with one Dirichlet boundary condition ($c(L)=0$) and one Robin (or mixed) boundary condition at $x=0$, which relates the flux to the concentration. This setup guarantees a unique and stable solution for the concentration profile $c(x)$ and the flux $J$.\n- **Objective**: The problem is stated using precise, unambiguous scientific language.\n- **Flaws**: The problem statement is free from scientific unsoundness, incompleteness, contradictions, or other listed flaws. The data provided for $D$ and $k$ are physically plausible for hydrogen in metals like steel or palladium near ambient temperature.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is **valid**. A rigorous solution will be constructed.\n\n**Solution Derivation**\nIn a one-dimensional system at steady state, the continuity equation $\\frac{\\partial c}{\\partial t} = -\\frac{\\partial J}{\\partial x}$ simplifies to $\\frac{\\partial J}{\\partial x} = 0$. This signifies that the flux $J$ is constant throughout the film, for all $x \\in [0, L]$.\n\nThe transport within the bulk of the film ($0  x \\le L$) is described by Fick's first law:\n$$J = -D \\frac{dc}{dx}$$\nSince $J$ and the diffusivity $D$ are constants, the concentration gradient $\\frac{dc}{dx} = -\\frac{J}{D}$ is also constant. This implies that the concentration profile $c(x)$ is linear. We integrate this equation from the surface at $x=0$ to the substrate at $x=L$:\n$$\\int_{c(0)}^{c(L)} dc = \\int_{0}^{L} \\left(-\\frac{J}{D}\\right) dx$$\n$$c(L) - c(0) = -\\frac{J}{D}(L-0)$$\nUsing the given boundary condition $c(L) = 0$ and the definition of the near-surface concentration $c_s = c(0)$, we have:\n$$0 - c_s = -\\frac{JL}{D}$$\n$$c_s = \\frac{JL}{D}$$\nThis relation connects the concentration drop across the bulk of the film, $c_s - c(L) = c_s$, to the flux $J$. It can be written in a form analogous to Ohm's law, $V=IR$, where the concentration drop is the potential, the flux is the current, and the resistance is $R_{\\mathrm{bulk}}$:\n$$c_s - 0 = J \\left(\\frac{L}{D}\\right)$$\nThe term $R_{\\mathrm{bulk}} = \\frac{L}{D}$ is therefore the bulk diffusion resistance.\n\nNext, we consider the boundary condition at the entry surface $x=0$, which is governed by first-order kinetics:\n$$J = k (c_{\\mathrm{eq}} - c_s)$$\nRearranging this equation also gives an Ohm's law-like form for the interface:\n$$c_{\\mathrm{eq}} - c_s = J \\left(\\frac{1}{k}\\right)$$\nHere, the concentration drop across the interface is $c_{\\mathrm{eq}} - c_s$, and the interfacial kinetic resistance is $R_{\\mathrm{int}} = \\frac{1}{k}$.\n\nThe problem requires expressing the total concentration drop, $c_{\\mathrm{eq}} - c(L) = c_{\\mathrm{eq}}$, in terms of the flux and a total resistance. The total drop is the sum of the drop across the interface and the drop across the bulk:\n$$c_{\\mathrm{eq}} = c_{\\mathrm{eq}} - 0 = (c_{\\mathrm{eq}} - c_s) + (c_s - 0)$$\nSubstituting the expressions for each part:\n$$c_{\\mathrm{eq}} = J \\left(\\frac{1}{k}\\right) + J \\left(\\frac{L}{D}\\right)$$\nFactoring out the flux $J$, we obtain the desired relationship:\n$$c_{\\mathrm{eq}} = J \\left(\\frac{1}{k} + \\frac{L}{D}\\right)$$\nThis shows that the total resistance to hydrogen entry is $R_{\\mathrm{total}} = R_{\\mathrm{int}} + R_{\\mathrm{bulk}}$.\n\nThe transition thickness, $L_t$, is defined as the thickness at which the interfacial resistance and the bulk diffusion resistance are equal.\n$$R_{\\mathrm{int}} = R_{\\mathrm{bulk}} \\quad \\text{at} \\quad L=L_t$$\n$$\\frac{1}{k} = \\frac{L_t}{D}$$\nSolving for $L_t$:\n$$L_t = \\frac{D}{k}$$\nThis expression defines the characteristic length scale that separates the two transport regimes. For $L \\ll L_t$, transport is limited by bulk diffusion ($L/D$ is small), and for $L \\gg L_t$, it is limited by the interfacial reaction ($1/k$ is relatively small). Wait, my reasoning is backwards. It should be: for $L \\ll L_t$, $L/D \\ll 1/k$, so interfacial resistance dominates (transport is limited by interface kinetics). For $L \\gg L_t$, $L/D \\gg 1/k$, so bulk diffusion resistance dominates (transport is limited by diffusion). This is the correct interpretation.\n\nNow, we compute the numerical value of $L_t$ using the given data: $D = 3.0 \\times 10^{-11} \\, \\mathrm{m^2\\,s^{-1}}$ and $k = 2.0 \\times 10^{-4} \\, \\mathrm{m\\,s^{-1}}$.\n$$L_t = \\frac{3.0 \\times 10^{-11} \\, \\mathrm{m^2\\,s^{-1}}}{2.0 \\times 10^{-4} \\, \\mathrm{m\\,s^{-1}}} = 1.5 \\times 10^{-7} \\, \\mathrm{m}$$\nThe problem requires the result to be expressed in nanometers. We use the conversion $1 \\, \\mathrm{nm} = 10^{-9} \\, \\mathrm{m}$.\n$$L_t = (1.5 \\times 10^{-7} \\, \\mathrm{m}) \\times \\left(\\frac{1 \\, \\mathrm{nm}}{10^{-9} \\, \\mathrm{m}}\\right) = 1.5 \\times 10^{2} \\, \\mathrm{nm} = 150 \\, \\mathrm{nm}$$\nThe final answer must be rounded to three significant figures. The calculation gives $1.5 \\times 10^2$, which has two significant figures based on the input data. Following the explicit instruction to provide three significant figures requires adjusting the precision of the result to $1.50 \\times 10^2$. The numerical value is $150$.

We will proceed with the derivation and calculation.\n\nThe objective is to determine the effective partial molar volume $\\Omega$ of an interstitial hydrogen atom in a metal lattice and the corresponding stress-induced shift in its chemical potential, $\\Delta \\mu_\\sigma$, from ab-initio data. This requires establishing a quantitative relationship between the strain-dependence of the hydrogen binding energy, $E_b(\\varepsilon_h)$, and the stress-dependence of its chemical potential, $\\mu(\\sigma_h)$.\n\nWe begin from the fundamental definition of the chemical potential, $\\mu$, as the change in the Gibbs free energy $G$ of a system upon the addition of a particle, at constant temperature $T$ and stress $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}$. For a single hydrogen atom, $\\mu_H \\approx \\Delta G$. The problem defines the binding energy, $E_b$, as a reversible work, which is thermodynamically equivalent to a change in a free energy potential.

The concepts of Mode I loading, stress intensity factor ($K_I$), yield stress ($\\sigma_y$), plane stress, and the estimation of plastic zone size are fundamental principles in solid mechanics and materials science. The context of hydrogen embrittlement in nanocrystalline metals is a legitimate and active field of scientific inquiry. The problem is scientifically sound.\n- **Well-Posedness**: The problem clearly defines the quantity to be derived ($r_p$) based on a specific physical criterion (opening stress reaching yield stress). It provides all necessary parameters ($K_I$, $\\sigma_y$) and conditions (plane stress, $\\theta=0$) for a unique solution. It is well-posed.\n- **Objectivity**: The language is technical and precise, free from any subjective or non-scientific assertions.\n- **Consistency and Completeness**: The problem is self-contained. The provided data are dimensionally consistent and physically realistic for a high-strength material. For instance, $1\\,\\mathrm{GPa} = 1000\\,\\mathrm{MPa}$, so the units can be reconciled. The required steps are logical and lead to a verifiable result.\n\nThe verdict is that the problem is **valid**. A solution will be provided.\n\nThe Mode I stress field near a crack tip in an isotropic linear elastic material is given by standard LEFM equations. The component of stress normal to the crack plane, the opening stress, is denoted $\\sigma_{yy}$. Its general form is:\n$$\n\\sigma_{yy}(r, \\theta) = \\frac{K_I}{\\sqrt{2\\pi r}} \\cos\\left(\\frac{\\theta}{2}\\right) \\left[1 + \\sin\\left(\\frac{\\theta}{2}\\right)\\sin\\left(\\frac{3\\theta}{2}\\right)\\right] + \\text{non-singular terms}\n$$\nwhere $r$ is the radial distance from the crack tip and $\\theta$ is the angle from the crack plane. Under the assumption of a dominant singular field, we neglect the non-singular terms.\n\nThe problem asks for the stress field along the crack plane directly ahead of the tip, which corresponds to the direction $\\theta=0$. Substituting $\\theta=0$ into the expression for $\\sigma_{yy}$:\n$$\n\\sigma_{yy}(r, 0) = \\frac{K_I}{\\sqrt{2\\pi r}} \\cos(0) \\left[1 + \\sin(0)\\sin(0)\\right] = \\frac{K_I}{\\sqrt{2\\pi r}}\n$$\nThis equation describes the opening stress singularity ahead of the crack tip.\n\nThe problem defines the plastic zone size, $r_p$, as the location $r$ where this stress first reaches the material's uniaxial yield stress, $\\sigma_y$. This is a first-order estimate known as the Irwin model. Setting $\\sigma_{yy}(r_p, 0) = \\sigma_y$:\n$$\n\\sigma_y = \\frac{K_I}{\\sqrt{2\\pi r_p}}\n$$\nWe now solve this equation for $r_p$ to derive the required expression.\n$$\n\\sqrt{2\\pi r_p} = \\frac{K_I}{\\sigma_y}\n$$\nSquaring both sides of the equation gives:\n$$\n2\\pi r_p = \\left(\\frac{K_I}{\\sigma_y}\\right)^2\n$$\nIsolating $r_p$, we obtain the expression for the plastic zone size under plane stress conditions:\n$$\nr_p = \\frac{1}{2\\pi} \\left(\\frac{K_I}{\\sigma_y}\\right)^2\n$$\nThis is the required analytical expression.\n\nNext, we compute the numerical value of $r_p$ using the provided data.\nGiven:\n$K_I = 1.20\\,\\mathrm{MPa}\\sqrt{\\mathrm{m}} = 1.20 \\times 10^6\\,\\mathrm{Pa}\\sqrt{\\mathrm{m}}$\n$\\sigma_y = 3.50\\,\\mathrm{GPa} = 3.50 \\times 10^9\\,\\mathrm{Pa}$\n\nWe must use consistent units (SI units: Pascals and meters).\nSubstituting these values into the derived expression:\n$$\nr_p = \\frac{1}{2\\pi} \\left(\\frac{1.20 \\times 10^6\\,\\mathrm{Pa}\\sqrt{\\mathrm{m}}}{3.50 \\times 10^9\\,\\mathrm{Pa}}\\right)^2\n$$\n$$\nr_p = \\frac{1}{2\\pi} \\left(\\frac{1.20}{3.50} \\times 10^{-3}\\right)^2\\,\\mathrm{m}\n$$\n$$\nr_p = \\frac{1}{2\\pi} (0.342857...)^2 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{m}\n$$\n$$\nr_p = \\frac{1}{2\\pi} (0.117551...) \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{m}\n$$\n$$\nr_p \\approx 0.018711... \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{m} = 1.8711... \\times 10^{-8}\\,\\mathrm{m}\n$$\nThe problem requires the answer in nanometers ($1\\,\\mathrm{nm} = 10^{-9}\\,\\mathrm{m}$).\n$$\nr_p = 18.711...\\,\\mathrm{nm}\n$$\nRounding to three significant figures, we get:\n$$\nr_p \\approx 18.7\\,\\mathrm{nm}\n$$\n\nFinally, a brief discussion on the relevance of this result.\nA plastic zone size on the order of nanometers ($18.7\\,\\mathrm{nm}$) is comparable to the characteristic length scale of the microstructure, specifically the grain size in a nanocrystalline material. When the region of plasticity and high hydrostatic stress is confined to a few nanograins, continuum mechanics assumptions begin to lose validity and fracture processes become governed by discrete, atomistic mechanisms at grain boundaries and interfaces, which are precisely the locations susceptible to hydrogen-enhanced decohesion or localized plasticity.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{18.7}\n$$", "id": "2774201"}]}
