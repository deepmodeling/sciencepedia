It is a canonical problem of deriving the Fowler–Guggenheim segregation isotherm and applying it to fit experimental data. I will proceed with the derivation and subsequent numerical solution.\n\nThe problem requires the derivation of the surface segregation equilibrium conditions for a multicomponent alloy from first principles, based on the Bragg–Williams mean-field approximation. This entails establishing the system's Helmholtz free energy and then using the condition of equal chemical potentials between the surface and the bulk reservoir.\n\nLet us consider a substitutional lattice with $N_S$ total surface sites, occupied by atoms of various species $i$. The surface site fraction of species $i$ is $\\theta_i = N_i / N_S$, where $N_i$ is the number of atoms of species $i$ on the surface. By definition, $\\sum_i \\theta_i = 1$. The bulk composition is given by site fractions $x_i$, with $\\sum_i x_i = 1$.\n\nIn the Bragg–Williams approximation, the Helmholtz free energy of the surface layer, $F_\\text{surf}$, is the sum of the internal energy $U_\\text{surf}$ and the entropic contribution $-TS_\\text{surf}$. The free energy per site is $f_\\text{surf} = F_\\text{surf}/N_S$.\n\n1.  **Surface Internal Energy ($U_\\text{surf}$):** The internal energy per site is composed of two terms: the intrinsic segregation energy and the pairwise interaction energy.\nThe intrinsic energy term is $\\sum_i \\theta_i g_i^0$, where $g_i^0$ is the free energy of an atom of species $i$ on a surface site in a pure environment.\nThe interaction energy term, within the mean-field approximation where atomic arrangements are random, is obtained by summing over all nearest-neighbor pairs. An atom of species $i$ has, on average, $z \\theta_j$ neighbors of species $j$, where $z$ is the surface coordination number. The interaction energy per atom of type $i$ is thus $z \\sum_j \\theta_j w_{ij}$, where $w_{ij}$ is the interaction energy of an $i-j$ pair. The total interaction energy per site is obtained by summing over all species, weighted by their site fractions, with a factor of $1/2$ to avoid double-counting bonds: $\\frac{z}{2} \\sum_{i,j} \\theta_i \\theta_j w_{ij}$.\nThe total internal energy per site is $u_\\text{surf} = \\sum_i \\theta_i g_i^0 + \\frac{z}{2} \\sum_{i,j} \\theta_i \\theta_j w_{ij}$.\n\n2.  **Surface Entropy ($S_\\text{surf}$):** The configurational entropy of a random mixture on a lattice is given by the Boltzmann formula $S = k_{\\mathrm{B}} \\ln W$, where $W$ is the number of ways to arrange $\\{N_i\\}$ atoms on $N_S$ sites.\n$W = N_S! / \\prod_i N_i!$.\nUsing Stirling's approximation, $\\ln N! \\approx N \\ln N - N$, the entropy per site is $s_\\text{surf} = -k_{\\mathrm{B}} \\sum_i \\theta_i \\ln \\theta_i$.\n\n3.  **Surface Free Energy ($F_\\text{surf}$):** The Helmholtz free energy per site is $f_\\text{surf} = u_\\text{surf} - T s_\\text{surf}$:\n$$f_\\text{surf} = \\sum_i \\theta_i g_i^0 + \\frac{z}{2} \\sum_{i,j} \\theta_i \\theta_j w_{ij} + k_{\\mathrm{B}} T \\sum_i \\theta_i \\ln \\theta_i$$\nwhere $k_{\\mathrm{B}}$ is Boltzmann's constant and $T$ is the absolute temperature.\n\n4.  **Chemical Potentials and Equilibrium:** Equilibrium between the surface and the bulk is achieved when the chemical potential of each species $i$ is the same in both phases: $\\mu_i^\\text{surf} = \\mu_i^\\text{bulk}$. This implies that the exchange chemical potentials are also equal: $\\mu_k^\\text{surf} - \\mu_M^\\text{surf} = \\mu_k^\\text{bulk} - \\mu_M^\\text{bulk}$ for any species $k$ and a chosen reference species $M$.\n\nThe exchange chemical potential on the surface is derived by taking the partial derivative of the total free energy $F_\\text{surf} = N_S f_\\text{surf}$ with respect to the number of atoms $N_k$, while an atom of species $M$ is removed to keep the total number of sites $N_S$ constant.\n$$\\mu_k^\\text{surf} - \\mu_M^\\text{surf} = \\left(\\frac{\\partial F_\\text{surf}}{\\partial N_k}\\right)_{N_S, N_{j \\ne k, M}}$$\nCarrying out this differentiation yields:\n$$\\mu_k^\\text{surf} - \\mu_M^\\text{surf} = (g_k^0 - g_M^0) + k_{\\mathrm{B}} T \\ln\\left(\\frac{\\theta_k}{\\theta_M}\\right) + z \\sum_j \\theta_j (w_{kj} - w_{Mj})$$\nFor the bulk, we assume an ideal solution, where the chemical potential of species $k$ is $\\mu_k^\\text{bulk} = g_k^b + k_{\\mathrm{B}} T \\ln x_k$, with $g_k^b$ being the free energy of pure bulk $k$.

With $w_{AA} = w_{BB} = 0$ and $w_{AB} = w_{BA}$, this simplifies to $z w_{AB} (\\theta_B - \\theta_A) = z w_{AB} (1 - 2\\theta_A)$.\nThe equation for $\\theta_A$ is:\n$$\\frac{\\theta_A}{1 - \\theta_A} = \\frac{x_A}{1 - x_A} \\exp\\left[-\\frac{\\Delta g_{A|B} + z w_{AB} (1 - 2\\theta_A)}{k_{\\mathrm{B}} T}\\right]$$\n\n- **Ternary System ($A-B-C$):** Let $C$ be the reference species ($M=C$). We have two equations for $k=A$ and $k=B$. Using the specified simplifications $w_{AC}=w_{BC}=0$ (and $w_{AA}=w_{BB}=w_{CC}=0$), the interaction sums are:\nFor $k=A$: $z \\sum_j \\theta_j(w_{Aj} - w_{Cj}) = z[\\theta_A(w_{AA}-w_{CA}) + \\theta_B(w_{AB}-w_{CB}) + \\theta_C(w_{AC}-w_{CC})] = z\\theta_B w_{AB}$.\nFor $k=B$: $z \\sum_j \\theta_j(w_{Bj} - w_{Cj}) = z[\\theta_A(w_{BA}-w_{CA}) + \\theta_B(w_{BB}-w_{CB}) + \\theta_C(w_{BC}-w_{CC})] = z\\theta_A w_{AB}$.\nThe coupled system of equations for $\\theta_A$ and $\\theta_B$ (with $\\theta_C = 1 - \\theta_A - \\theta_B$) is:\n$$\\frac{\\theta_A}{\\theta_C} = \\frac{x_A}{x_C} \\exp\\left[-\\frac{\\Delta g_A + z w_{AB} \\theta_B}{k_{\\mathrm{B}} T}\\right]$$\n$$\\frac{\\theta_B}{\\theta_C} = \\frac{x_B}{x_C} \\exp\\left[-\\frac{\\Delta g_B + z w_{AB} \\theta_A}{k_{\\mathrm{B}} T}\\right]$$\n\n**Numerical Solution and Parameter Fitting:**\nTo find the interaction parameter $w_{AB}$, we perform a nonlinear regression analysis to minimize the squared difference between the model-predicted surface compositions, $\\theta_i^{\\mathrm{model}}$, and the measured compositions, $\\theta_i^{\\mathrm{meas}}$. Tikhonov regularization is added to penalize large values of $w_{AB}$.

The physical models presented—the Read–Shockley model for low-angle grain boundary energy, the Gibbs adsorption equation for interfacial thermodynamics, the Langmuir–McLean isotherm for solute segregation, and the cohesive zone model for fracture—are all standard and established principles in materials science and mechanics. The provided data are physically realistic. Thus, the problem is valid, and we proceed with a rigorous solution.\n\nThe objective is to compute the reduction factor $R = \\sqrt{W_{\\text{sep}}(\\theta_1, c_b, T) / W_{\\text{sep}}(\\theta_0, 0, T)}$. This requires deriving an expression for the work of separation, $W_{\\text{sep}}(\\theta, c_b, T)$, as a function of misorientation angle $\\theta$, bulk solute concentration $c_b$, and temperature $T$.\n\nFirst, we determine the effect of solute segregation on the interfacial free energies, $\\gamma_s$ and $\\gamma_{\\text{gb}}$, to first order in $c_b$. According to the Gibbs adsorption equation, at a constant temperature $T$, the change in interfacial free energy $\\gamma_i$ for an interface $i$ is given by $\\mathrm{d}\\gamma_i = -\\Gamma_i \\mathrm{d}\\mu$, where $\\Gamma_i$ is the interfacial excess of the solute and $\\mu$ is its chemical potential.

The differential of the chemical potential is $\\mathrm{d}\\mu = k_B T \\frac{\\mathrm{d}c_b}{c_b}$. Substituting this into the Gibbs equation yields the derivative of the interfacial energy with respect to bulk concentration:\n$$\n\\frac{\\mathrm{d}\\gamma_i}{\\mathrm{d}c_b} = \\frac{\\mathrm{d}\\gamma_i}{\\mathrm{d}\\mu} \\frac{\\mathrm{d}\\mu}{\\mathrm{d}c_b} = -\\Gamma_i \\left( \\frac{k_B T}{c_b} \\right)\n$$\nThe problem states that in the Henry's law limit of the Langmuir–McLean isotherm, the interfacial excess is $\\Gamma_i \\approx N_i K_i c_b$, where $N_i$ is the areal density of segregation sites and $K_i$ is the segregation equilibrium constant.
