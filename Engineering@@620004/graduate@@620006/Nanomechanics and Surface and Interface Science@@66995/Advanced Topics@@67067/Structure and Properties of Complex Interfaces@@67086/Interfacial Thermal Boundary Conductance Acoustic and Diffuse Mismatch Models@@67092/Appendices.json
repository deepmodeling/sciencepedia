We are instructed to start from first principles within the Debye approximation and the Diffuse Mismatch Model.\n\nFirst, we establish the spectral energy flux incident on the interface from one side. In a semi-infinite medium at temperature $T$, the energy flux per unit area in the z-direction, carried by phonons of a specific branch $p$ and frequency $\\omega$, is obtained by integrating over all possible phonon states in the hemisphere of momentum space with a positive velocity component $v_z > 0$.

The setup and task requirements are as follows.\n\n1. Physical framework and fundamental base:\n   - Consider two isotropic, non-porous, macroscopically flat solids $A$ and $B$ in perfect mechanical contact with a finite interfacial conductance. Assume harmonic (phonon) energy carriers and small temperature differences so that linear response is valid.\n   - Adopt the Landauer picture for energy transfer across an interface. The net interfacial energy flux under a small temperature difference $\\Delta T$ is the difference of two one-sided incoming ballistic fluxes attenuated by a mode- and frequency-dependent transmission probability, and then linearized for small $\\Delta T$.\n   - In an isotropic three-dimensional Debye approximation with three acoustic branches (one longitudinal, two transverse), assume constant group velocities $v_{i,L}$ and $v_{i,T}$ for side $i \\in \\{A,B\\}$ and a Debye cutoff angular frequency $\\omega_{D,i}$ related to the Debye temperature $\\Theta_{D,i}$ by $\\hbar \\omega_{D,i} = k_B \\Theta_{D,i}$, where $\\hbar$ is the reduced Planck constant and $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant. Use branch degeneracy factors $g_L = 1$ and $g_T = 2$.\n   - The three-dimensional Debye density of states per unit volume per angular frequency for branch $b \\in \\{L,T\\}$ on side $i$ is $D_{i,b}(\\omega) = \\omega^2/(2\\pi^2 v_{i,b}^3)$, the equilibrium Bose-Einstein occupation is $n(\\omega,T) = \\left(\\exp(\\hbar \\omega/k_B T)-1\\right)^{-1}$, and the spectral volumetric heat capacity is $C_{i,b}(\\omega,T) = k_B D_{i,b}(\\omega) \\left(\\frac{\\hbar \\omega}{k_B T}\\right)^2 \\frac{\\exp(\\hbar \\omega/k_B T)}{(\\exp(\\hbar \\omega/k_B T)-1)^2}$.\n   - The one-sided ballistic geometric factor for an isotropic flux is $1/4$.\n\n2. Interfacial transmission models to be used:\n   - Acoustic Mismatch Model (AMM): Use an angle-averaged, frequency-independent approximation for each branch that reduces to a normal-incidence acoustic impedance mismatch form. The acoustic impedance for branch $b$ on side $i$ is $Z_{i,b} = \\rho_i v_{i,b}$, where $\\rho_i$ is the mass density. The branch transmission coefficient should reflect the impedance mismatch and be symmetric under exchange of $A$ and $B$.\n   - Diffuse Mismatch Model (DMM): Assume the interface completely randomizes incident phonons and that transmission into the receiving side is proportional to the number of available final states at the same angular frequency. In the isotropic Debye model, this yields a frequency-independent transmission probability for $i \\to j$ that depends on the set $\\{v_{i,L}, v_{i,T}\\}$ and $\\{v_{j,L}, v_{j,T}\\}$.\n\n3. Model expression to be derived and implemented:\n   - Starting from the Landauer framework and the above Debye model ingredients, derive a frequency-integral expression for the interfacial conductance $G(T)$ valid at small temperature difference, expressed as a sum over acoustic branches and an integral over angular frequency up to the minimum Debye cutoff supported by both sides of the interface. The expression must clearly show how the transmission model (AMM or DMM) enters. Perform a change of variables $x = \\hbar \\omega/(k_B T)$ to render the integral dimensionless and isolate the temperature dependence.\n   - Your implementation should use these derived expressions to compute two model predictions for $G(T)$: $G_{\\text{AMM}}(T)$ and $G_{\\text{DMM}}(T)$.\n\n4. Fitting strategy:\n   - Consider a convex mixing model $G_{\\alpha}(T) = \\alpha \\, G_{\\text{AMM}}(T) + \\left(1-\\alpha\\right) \\, G_{\\text{DMM}}(T)$, with mixing parameter $\\alpha \\in \\mathbb{R}$. Given synthetic measurements $\\{(T_k, y_k)\\}$ with known standard deviations $\\{\\sigma_k\\}$, estimate $\\hat{\\alpha}$ by minimizing a weighted sum of squared residuals. Use the exact weighted least squares solution for a linear-in-parameter model, and derive the closed-form estimate and its measurement-noise Fisher information variance. Ensure to impose no constraint on $\\alpha$ in the estimator.\n   - Perform a local sensitivity-based uncertainty propagation of $\\hat{\\alpha}$ from uncertainties in selected physical inputs by computing numerical partial derivatives of $\\hat{\\alpha}$ with respect to the inputs (keeping the measured $\\{y_k\\}$ fixed), and then combine these with the given input standard deviations assuming independence to obtain an additional variance contribution. Report the combined standard deviation as the square root of the sum of the measurement-variance and parameter-variance contributions.\n\n5.

Synthetic data generation:\n   - For a specified list of temperatures $\\{T_k\\}$ and a specified true mixing parameter $\\alpha_{\\text{true}}$, generate synthetic measurements\n     $$ y_k = \\alpha_{\\text{true}} \\, G_{\\text{AMM}}(T_k) + \\left(1-\\alpha_{\\text{true}}\\right) G_{\\text{DMM}}(T_k) + \\epsilon_k, $$\n     where $\\epsilon_k$ are independent Gaussian random variables with zero mean and known standard deviations\n     $$ \\sigma_k = f \\cdot \\frac{G_{\\text{AMM}}(T_k) + G_{\\text{DMM}}(T_k)}{2}. $$\n     Use a fixed pseudorandom number generator seed equal to `0` to ensure reproducibility. The scalar $f$ is a supplied fractional noise level.\n\n7. Sensitivity and uncertainty propagation of the fitted parameter:\n   - Let $\\hat{\\alpha}$ be the weighted least squares estimate using the $\\{(T_k, y_k, \\sigma_k)\\}$ from the generation step. The measurement-noise contribution to $\\mathrm{Var}(\\hat{\\alpha})$ must be computed from the Fisher information associated with the linear model.\n   - For parameter-uncertainty propagation, treat the following side $B$ inputs as uncertain with known standard deviations: $v_{B,L}$, $v_{B,T}$, and $\\Theta_{D,B}$. Compute numerical partial derivatives of $\\hat{\\alpha}$ with respect to each of these inputs via symmetric finite differences using a small absolute perturbation on each input while keeping the realized $\\{y_k\\}$ fixed. Combine their contributions assuming independence:\n     $$ \\mathrm{Var}_{\\text{param}}(\\hat{\\alpha}) = \\sum_{i \\in \\{v_{B,L}, v_{B,T}, \\Theta_{D,B}\\}} \\left(\\frac{\\partial \\hat{\\alpha}}{\\partial i}\\right)^2 \\sigma_i^2. $$\n     The combined standard deviation is then $\\sqrt{\\mathrm{Var}(\\hat{\\alpha}) + \\mathrm{Var}_{\\text{param}}(\\hat{\\alpha})}$.\n\n8. Test suite and required outputs:\n   Implement all computations in SI units. The final program must compute the following three test cases and produce a single line of output containing the results as a comma-separated list enclosed in square brackets, with no additional text. All outputs are dimensionless floats.\n\n   - Case 1 (happy path fit): Temperatures $\\{50, 100, 200, 300\\}$ in kelvin, true mixing parameter $\\alpha_{\\text{true}} = 0.6$, fractional noise level $f = 0.03$. Output the estimated $\\hat{\\alpha}$ as a float (dimensionless).\n   - Case 2 (near-boundary fit): Temperatures $\\{50, 100, 150, 200, 250, 300\\}$ in kelvin, $\\alpha_{\\text{true}} = 0.98$, $f = 0.005$. Output the estimated $\\hat{\\alpha}$ as a float (dimensionless).\n   - Case 3 (combined standard deviation of the fitted parameter): Use the same temperature set and $\\alpha_{\\text{true}}$ and $f$ as in Case 1 to generate the data once. For parameter-uncertainty propagation, use $\\sigma_{v_{B,L}} = 100 \\ \\mathrm{m/s}$, $\\sigma_{v_{B,T}} = 100 \\ \\mathrm{m/s}$, and $\\sigma_{\\Theta_{D,B}} = 10 \\ \\mathrm{K}$. Use symmetric finite differences with an absolute perturbation equal to one tenth of each specified standard deviation. Output the combined standard deviation $\\sqrt{\\mathrm{Var}(\\hat{\\alpha}) + \\mathrm{Var}_{\\text{param}}(\\hat{\\alpha})}$ as a float (dimensionless).\n\nFinal output format: Your program should produce a single line of output containing the results as a comma-separated list enclosed in square brackets (e.g., \"[result1,result2,result3]\").", "solution": "The interfacial thermal boundary conductance, $G(T)$, is defined in the linear response regime. In the Landauer picture for phonons, this is given by an integral over phonon modes. A symmetric formulation for conductance is:\n$$ G(T) = \\frac{1}{2} \\sum_{b \\in \\{L,T\\}} g_b \\int_0^{\\omega_{\\text{max}}} \\hbar\\omega \\frac{\\partial n}{\\partial T} \\left( \\frac{\\omega^2 \\tau_{A \\to B, b}(\\omega)}{4\\pi^2 v_{A,b}^2} + \\frac{\\omega^2 \\tau_{B \\to A, b}(\\omega)}{4\\pi^2 v_{B,b}^2} \\right) d\\omega $$\nwhere $g_b$ is the branch degeneracy ($g_L=1, g_T=2$), $\\omega_{\\text{max}} = \\min(\\omega_{D,A}, \\omega_{D,B})$, and $\\tau$ is the transmission probability. Using $\\frac{\\partial n}{\\partial T} = \\frac{\\hbar\\omega}{k_B T^2} \\frac{e^{\\hbar\\omega/k_B T}}{(e^{\\hbar\\omega/k_B T}-1)^2}$ and performing the change of variables $x = \\hbar\\omega/(k_B T)$, we obtain:\n$$ G(T) = \\frac{k_B^4 T^3}{16\\pi^2 \\hbar^3} \\int_0^{\\Theta_{D, \\text{min}}/T} \\frac{x^4 e^x}{(e^x-1)^2} \\sum_{b \\in \\{L,T\\}} g_b \\left( \\frac{\\tau_{A \\to B, b}}{v_{A,b}^2} + \\frac{\\tau_{B \\to A, b}}{v_{B,b}^2} \\right) dx $$\nwhere $\\Theta_{D, \\text{min}} = \\min(\\Theta_{D,A}, \\Theta_{D,B})$. Since the transmission models are frequency-independent, the summation can be moved outside the integral.\n\nFor the **Acoustic Mismatch Model (AMM)**, the transmission probability for each branch $b$ is based on the acoustic impedances $Z_{i,b} = \\rho_i v_{i,b}$. The symmetric, normal-incidence form is:\n$$ \\tau_{b, \\text{AMM}} = \\frac{4 Z_{A,b} Z_{B,b}}{(Z_{A,b} + Z_{B,b})^2} $$\nThis is symmetric, $\\tau_{b, \\text{AMM}} = \\tau_{A \\to B, b} = \\tau_{B \\to A, b}$. The conductance $G_{\\text{AMM}}(T)$ is:\n$$ G_{\\text{AMM}}(T) = \\frac{k_B^4 T^3}{16\\pi^2 \\hbar^3} \\left( \\sum_{b \\in \\{L,T\\}} g_b \\frac{4 Z_{A,b} Z_{B,b}}{(Z_{A,b} + Z_{B,b})^2} \\left[ \\frac{1}{v_{A,b}^2} + \\frac{1}{v_{B,b}^2} \\right] \\right) \\int_0^{\\Theta_{D, \\text{min}}/T} \\frac{x^4 e^x}{(e^x-1)^2} dx $$\n\nFor the **Diffuse Mismatch Model (DMM)**, transmission is proportional to the density of available modes. Let $C_i = g_L v_{i,L}^{-2} + g_T v_{i,T}^{-2} = v_{i,L}^{-2} + 2 v_{i,T}^{-2}$. The transmission probabilities are independent of branch:\n$$ \\tau_{A \\to B, \\text{DMM}} = \\frac{C_B}{C_A + C_B} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\tau_{B \\to A, \\text{DMM}} = \\frac{C_A}{C_A + C_B} $$\nThe summation term becomes:\n$$ \\sum_{b} g_b \\left( \\frac{\\tau_{A \\to B, \\text{DMM}}}{v_{A,b}^2} + \\frac{\\tau_{B \\to A, \\text{DMM}}}{v_{B,b}^2} \\right) = \\tau_{A \\to B, \\text{DMM}} C_A + \\tau_{B \\to A, \\text{DMM}} C_B = \\frac{C_B C_A}{C_A+C_B} + \\frac{C_A C_B}{C_A+C_B} = \\frac{2 C_A C_B}{C_A + C_B} $$\nThus, the DMM conductance $G_{\\text{DMM}}(T)$ is:\n$$ G_{\\text{DMM}}(T) = \\frac{k_B^4 T^3}{16\\pi^2 \\hbar^3} \\left( \\frac{2 C_A C_B}{C_A + C_B} \\right) \\int_0^{\\Theta_{D, \\text{min}}/T} \\frac{x^4 e^x}{(e^x-1)^2} dx $$\n\nTo estimate the mixing parameter $\\alpha$ in $G_{\\alpha}(T) = \\alpha G_{\\text{AMM}}(T) + (1-\\alpha) G_{\\text{DMM}}(T)$, we minimize the weighted sum of squared residuals $\\chi^2 = \\sum_k w_k (y_k - G_{\\alpha}(T_k))^2$, where $w_k = 1/\\sigma_k^2$. The model is linear in $\\alpha$. Solving $\\partial \\chi^2 / \\partial \\alpha = 0$ gives the weighted least squares estimate $\\hat{\\alpha}$:\n$$ \\hat{\\alpha} = \\frac{\\sum_k w_k (G_{\\text{AMM},k} - G_{\\text{DMM},k})(y_k - G_{\\text{DMM},k})}{\\sum_k w_k (G_{\\text{AMM},k} - G_{\\text{DMM},k})^2} $$\nThe variance of this estimate due to measurement noise $\\{\\sigma_k\\}$ is given by the inverse of the Fisher information for this linear model:\n$$ \\mathrm{Var}_{\\text{meas}}(\\hat{\\alpha}) = \\left( \\sum_k w_k (G_{\\text{AMM},k} - G_{\\text{DMM},k})^2 \\right)^{-1} = \\left( \\sum_k \\frac{(G_{\\text{AMM},k} - G_{\\text{DMM},k})^2}{\\sigma_k^2} \\right)^{-1} $$\n\nThe uncertainty in $\\hat{\\alpha}$ due to uncertainties in input parameters $\\{p_i\\}$ is computed via first-order sensitivity analysis. Assuming independent parameters, the variance contribution is:\n$$ \\mathrm{Var}_{\\text{param}}(\\hat{\\alpha}) = \\sum_i \\left(\\frac{\\partial \\hat{\\alpha}}{\\partial p_i}\\right)^2 \\sigma_{p_i}^2 $$\nThe partial derivatives $\\partial \\hat{\\alpha} / \\partial p_i$ are computed numerically using a symmetric finite difference scheme, where for each calculation of $\\hat{\\alpha}(p_i \\pm h_i)$, the model functions $G_{\\text{AMM}}$ and $G_{\\text{DMM}}$ are re-evaluated with the perturbed parameter, while the synthetic measurement data $\\{y_k\\}$ are held fixed. The total uncertainty is the standard deviation $\\sqrt{\\mathrm{Var}_{\\text{meas}}(\\hat{\\alpha}) + \\mathrm{Var}_{\\text{param}}(\\hat{\\alpha})}$.", "answer": "[0.601569424785,0.979672049878,0.012586737599]", "id": "2776155"}]}
