The domain $x \\in [0, L]$ is uniformly discretized into $N$ nodes, with spacing $h = L/(N-1)$.\n\nThe iterative algorithm proceeds as follows:\n1.  Initialize the potential $\\phi(x)$ and electron density $n(x)$ with a reasonable guess. A linear profile for both, interpolating between the known boundary values, is a suitable choice.\n2.  Start the Gummel loop:\n    a. **Solve for $n(x)$ and $J_n$:** With the current potential profile $\\phi^{(k)}(x)$ known from the previous iteration $k$, the drift-diffusion equation is a linear first-order ODE for $n(x)$. This equation can be solved analytically for $n(x)$ in terms of an integral involving $\\phi(x)$ and the unknown constant $J_n$.\n       $n(x) = e^{\\phi(x)/V_T} \\left[ C_1 + \\frac{J_n}{qD_n}\\int_0^x e^{-\\phi(s)/V_T} ds \\right]$\n       The integration constant $C_1$ is found from the boundary condition at $x=0$: $C_1 = n(0)e^{-\\phi(0)/V_T}$. Applying the second boundary condition at $x=L$ allows us to solve for the unknown current density $J_n$:\n       $$J_n = q D_n \\frac{n(L)e^{-\\phi(L)/V_T} - n(0)e^{-\\phi(0)/V_T}}{\\int_0^L e^{-\\phi(s)/V_T} ds}$$\n       The integral is computed numerically using the trapezoidal rule on the discretized $\\phi(x)$ profile. With $J_n$ known, the electron density $n^{(k+1)}(x)$ at each grid point is updated using the analytical solution, again computing the required integrals numerically. This method is a one-dimensional equivalent of the conservative Scharfetter-Gummel flux formulation.\n\n    b. **Solve for $\\phi(x)$:** With the newly computed electron density profile $n^{(k+1)}(x)$, Poisson's equation becomes a linear second-order boundary value problem for the potential $\\phi(x)$.\n       $$-\\frac{d^2\\phi}{dx^2} = \\frac{q}{\\varepsilon} \\left(N_D - n^{(k+1)}(x)\\right)$$\n       We discretize this equation using a central finite difference approximation for the second derivative:\n       $$-\\frac{\\phi_{i-1} - 2\\phi_i + \\phi_{i+1}}{h^2} = \\frac{q}{\\varepsilon} \\left(N_D - n_i\\right) \\quad \\text{for } i=1, \\dots, N-2$$\n       This results in a system of $N-2$ linear equations for the unknown internal potential values $\\phi_1, \\dots, \\phi_{N-2}$. The system has a tridiagonal matrix structure, which can be solved efficiently. After solving, a potential update $\\phi^{(k+1)}(x)$ is obtained. To aid convergence, a damping factor $\\alpha$ is applied to the potential update: $\\phi_{new} = (1-\\alpha)\\phi_{old} + \\alpha\\phi_{computed}$.\n\n3.  **Check for Convergence:** The loop continues until the maximum relative change in both the potential and electron density profiles between successive iterations falls below a tolerance of $10^{-6}$.\n\nOnce the solver converges for a given applied voltage $V_{\\mathrm{app}}$, the final steady-state current density $J = |J_n|$ is recorded. This process is repeated for each voltage in the specified list for a given set of device parameters.\n\nFinally, to classify the transport regime, a linear regression is performed on the logarithm of the computed currents versus the logarithm of the applied voltages. The model is $\\ln J = m \\ln V_{\\mathrm{app}} + \\ln C$. The slope $m$ of this log-log plot is extracted. If $m \\ge 1.8$, the conduction is classified as space-charge-limited (output $1$); otherwise, it is not (output $0$). This procedure is repeated for all three test cases.", "answer": "```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy.linalg import solve_banded\n\n# Constants in SI units\nQ = 1.60217663e-19  # Elementary charge (C)\nK_B = 1.380649e-23   # Boltzmann constant (J/K)\nEPS0 = 8.854187817e-12 # Vacuum permittivity (F/m)\n\ndef compute_and_classify(params):\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves the drift-diffusion equations for a given set of parameters and voltage list,\n    then performs log-log regression to classify transport.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Unpack parameters\n    ND, L, mu_n, eps_r, phi_B_eV, NC, T, V_list = params\n    \n    # Derived parameters\n    V_T = K_B * T / Q\n    eps = eps_r * EPS0\n    D_n = mu_n * V_T\n    \n    J_values = []\n\n    for V_app in V_list:\n        # --- Numerical Setup ---\n        N = 201\n        h = L / (N - 1)\n        x = np.linspace(0, L, N)\n\n        # --- Boundary Conditions ---\n        n0 = NC * np.exp(-phi_B_eV / V_T)\n        nL = ND\n        phi0 = 0.0\n        phiL = V_app\n\n        # --- Initial Guess ---\n        phi = np.linspace(phi0, phiL, N)\n        n = np.linspace(n0, nL, N, dtype=np.float64)\n        \n        # Damping factor for potential update to ensure convergence\n        alpha_phi = 0.1\n\n        # --- Gummel Iteration ---\n        for iter_count in range(200):\n            phi_old = phi.copy()\n            n_old = n.copy()\n\n            # --- Step 1: Solve for n and J_n, given phi ---\n            integrand = np.exp(-phi / V_T)\n            \n            # Integral over the whole length (for J_n denominator)\n            integral_L = np.trapz(integrand, x)\n            \n            # Current density J_n\n            numerator = Q * D_n * (nL * np.exp(-phiL / V_T) - n0 * np.exp(-phi0 / V_T))\n            if abs(integral_L) < 1e-300: # Protect against underflow\n                J_n = 0.0\n            else:\n                J_n = numerator / integral_L\n\n            # Update electron density n(x)\n            integral_x = np.zeros(N)\n            for i in range(1, N):\n                integral_x[i] = np.trapz(integrand[:i+1], x[:i+1])\n\n            n[1:N-1] = np.exp(phi[1:N-1]/V_T) * (n0 * np.exp(-phi0/V_T) + (J_n / (Q * D_n)) * integral_x[1:N-1])\n            n[0], n[N-1] = n0, nL\n\n            # --- Step 2: Solve for phi, given n ---\n            # Discretized Poisson's equation: -phi_{i-1} + 2*phi_i - phi_{i+1} = h^2 * (Q/eps) * (ND - n_i)\n            \n            # Right-hand side (RHS) vector for internal nodes\n            rhs = (h**2 * Q / eps) * (ND - n[1:N-1])\n            \n            # Adjust RHS for Dirichlet boundary conditions\n            rhs[0] += phi0\n            rhs[-1] += phiL\n\n            # Tridiagonal matrix diagonals (u=1, l=1) for solve_banded\n            # A has main diagonal of 2, and off-diagonals of -1\n            ab = np.zeros((3, N - 2))\n            ab[0, 1:] = -1.0  # Upper diagonal\n            ab[1, :] = 2.0   # Main diagonal\n            ab[2, :-1] = -1.0 # Lower diagonal\n\n            # Solve the system for internal phi points\n            phi_internal = solve_banded((1, 1), ab, rhs, check_finite=False)\n            \n            # Create a new full phi profile\n            phi_computed = np.zeros(N)\n            phi_computed[0], phi_computed[N-1] = phi0, phiL\n            phi_computed[1:N-1] = phi_internal\n\n            # Apply damping (mixing)\n            phi = (1 - alpha_phi) * phi_old + alpha_phi * phi_computed\n\n            # --- Step 3: Check for convergence ---\n            norm_phi = np.linalg.norm(phi, np.inf)\n            err_phi = np.linalg.norm(phi - phi_old, np.inf) / (norm_phi + 1e-20)\n\n            norm_n = np.linalg.norm(n, np.inf)\n            err_n = np.linalg.norm(n - n_old, np.inf) / (norm_n + 1e-20)\n\n            if max(err_phi, err_n) < 1e-6:\n                break\n        \n        J_values.append(abs(J_n))\n\n    # --- Post-processing: Log-log regression ---\n    log_V = np.log(V_list)\n    log_J = np.log(J_values)\n    \n    # Fit y = m*x + c, where y=log_J, x=log_V. polyfit returns [m, c]\n    m, _ = np.polyfit(log_V, log_J, 1)\n\n    # Classify based on slope m\n    return 1 if m >= 1.8 else 0\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Main function to define test cases and compute the final results.\n    \"\"\"\n    test_cases = [\n        # Case #1: (ND, L, mu_n, eps_r, phi_B, NC, T, V_list)\n        (1.0e22, 1.0e-7, 0.14, 11.7, 0.85, 2.8e25, 300, [0.05, 0.10, 0.20]),\n        # Case #2\n        (1.0e20, 2.0e-7, 0.14, 11.7, 0.20, 2.8e25, 300, [0.10, 0.20, 0.50]),\n        # Case #3\n        (5.0e21, 5.0e-8, 0.20, 11.7, 0.65, 2.8e25, 300, [0.01, 0.03, 0.05]),\n    ]\n\n    results = []\n    for case in test_cases:\n        classification = compute_and_classify(case)\n        results.append(classification)\n\n    print(f\"[{','.join(map(str, results))}]\")\n\nsolve()\n```", "id": "2775582"}]}
