In this limit, the instability condition $k = U_0(2\\pi/a)^2\\cos(2\\pi x_c/a)$ implies that $\\cos(2\\pi x_c/a) \\to 0$. Let's trace the tip starting from a potential minimum (e.g., near $x=a/2$) being pulled to the right. The instability occurs as the tip is forced towards the next potential maximum (at $x=a$). The tip must enter the region where the substrate potential has negative curvature, i.e., $x \\in (3a/4, 5a/4)$. The instability condition $\\cos(2\\pi x_c/a) > 0$ is satisfied in this region. As $k \\to 0$, $x_c$ approaches the boundary where $\\cos(2\\pi x_c/a)=0$. For a forward pull, slip occurs at $x_c \\to 3a/4$.\n\nAt the moment of slip, the stage position $X_c$ is fixed. The tip jumps to the next stable equilibrium position, $x_f$, of the potential $U_{\\text{tot}}(x;X_c)$. The new equilibrium satisfies $k(x_f-X_c) = U_0(2\\pi/a)\\sin(2\\pi x_f/a)$. We can find the value of $kX_c$ at the slip point:\n$$\nkX_c = kx_c - U_0(2\\pi/a)\\sin(2\\pi x_c/a)\n$$\nIn the limit $k \\to 0$, $x_c \\to 3a/4$, so $kx_c \\to 0$. Also, $\\sin(2\\pi x_c/a) \\to \\sin(3\\pi/2) = -1$. Thus,\n$$\n\\lim_{k\\to 0} kX_c = 0 - U_0(2\\pi/a)(-1) = \\frac{2\\pi U_0}{a}\n$$\nSubstituting this back into the equilibrium equation for $x_f$:\n$$\nkx_f - kX_c = U_0(2\\pi/a)\\sin(2\\pi x_f/a) \\implies kx_f - \\frac{2\\pi U_0}{a} \\approx U_0(2\\pi/a)\\sin(2\\pi x_f/a)\n$$\nAs $k \\to 0$, the term $kx_f$ vanishes, leaving:\n$$\n-\\frac{2\\pi U_0}{a} = U_0\\frac{2\\pi}{a}\\sin(2\\pi x_f/a) \\implies \\sin(2\\pi x_f/a) = -1\n$$\nThis gives the possible final positions $x_f = (3/4 + n)a$ for any integer $n$. Stability at these points is guaranteed as $\\partial^2U_{\\text{tot}}/\\partial x^2 = k-U_0(2\\pi/a)^2\\cos(2\\pi x_f/a) = k > 0$. The tip jumps from $x_c \\approx 3a/4$ to the first available stable minimum with $x_f > x_c$.

The fundamental criterion for the applicability of a continuum model is the principle of separation of scales. This principle states that the characteristic length scale over which the macroscopic fields (such as stress and displacement) vary, denoted here as $L$, must be significantly larger than the characteristic length scale of the underlying discrete microstructure, denoted as $l$. Mathematically, this condition is expressed as $L \\gg l$.\n\nFirst, we must identify the relevant length scales from the problem statement.\nThe problem specifies that the characteristic lateral variation length for the fields is the diameter of the contact area, $D_c$. The contact is given as nominally circular with a lateral radius $a_c$. Therefore, the characteristic length scale of the field variation is:\n$$L = D_c = 2 a_c$$\n\nThe underlying microstructure is the crystalline lattice of sodium chloride (NaCl). The characteristic length of this discrete structure is its cubic lattice constant, $a$.

For a continuum description to be considered highly accurate, the ratio $N$ should be large, typically on the order of $100$ or more. A value of $N \\approx 18$ represents a borderline case. While it is not so small (e.g., $N < 5$) as to render continuum mechanics completely invalid, it is also not large enough to ignore the discreteness of the atomic lattice. At this scale, the properties of individual atoms and the specific crystallographic orientation can have a non-negligible effect on the contact mechanics, leading to deviations from the predictions of classical continuum theories like Hertzian contact mechanics. Therefore, the application of continuum elasticity is questionable and would likely serve only as a first-order approximation.

We will implement the Climbing-Image Nudged Elastic Band (CI-NEB) method to find this path and the associated energy barrier.\n\n**1. Physical System and Potential Energy Surface**\n\nThe adsorbate's position is given by the vector $\\mathbf{r}=(x,y)$. Its potential energy $V(\\mathbf{r})$ is described by the function:\n$$\nV(x,y) = V_0 \\left[2 - \\cos\\left(\\frac{2\\pi x}{a}\\right) - \\cos\\left(\\frac{2\\pi y}{a}\\right)\\right]\n$$\nwhere $V_0$ is the corrugation amplitude in units of electronvolts (eV) and $a$ is the lattice parameter in ångströms (Å). This potential describes a periodic square lattice. The initial state is a potential minimum at $\\mathbf{r}_{\\text{initial}} = (0,0)$ and the final state is an adjacent minimum at $\\mathbf{r}_{\\text{final}} = (a,0)$. At these minima, the energy is $V(0,0) = V_0(2-1-1) = 0$ eV.\n\nThe true force on the adsorbate is the negative gradient of the potential, $\\mathbf{F}_{\\text{true}} = -\\nabla V$. The gradient is calculated as:\n$$\n\\nabla V(x,y) = \\left( \\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial x}, \\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial y} \\right) = \\left( \\frac{2\\pi V_0}{a} \\sin\\left(\\frac{2\\pi x}{a}\\right), \\frac{2\\pi V_0}{a} \\sin\\left(\\frac{2\\pi y}{a}\\right) \\right)\n$$\n\n**2. The Nudged Elastic Band (NEB) Method**\n\nThe NEB method discretizes the path into a series of $M$ images, denoted $\\{\\mathbf{r}_0, \\mathbf{r}_1, \\dots, \\mathbf{r}_{M-1}\\}$, where $\\mathbf{r}_0 = \\mathbf{r}_{\\text{initial}}$ and $\\mathbf{r}_{M-1} = \\mathbf{r}_{\\text{final}}$ are fixed endpoints. The $M-2$ intermediate images are iteratively relaxed to converge to the MEP.\n\nThe initial path is constructed by linear interpolation between the endpoints:\n$$\n\\mathbf{r}_i = \\mathbf{r}_0 + \\frac{i}{M-1} (\\mathbf{r}_{M-1} - \\mathbf{r}_0) \\quad \\text{for} \\quad i = 1, \\dots, M-2.\n$$\n\nThe core of the NEB method lies in the definition of the force used to relax the images. For each intermediate image $\\mathbf{r}_i$, this force, $\\mathbf{F}_{\\text{NEB},i}$, has two components:\n- The component of the true force perpendicular to the path, $\\mathbf{F}_{\\text{true},i}^{\\perp}$.\n- The component of an artificial spring force parallel to the path, $\\mathbf{F}_{\\text{spring},i}^{\\parallel}$.\n\nThis construction ensures that images slide \"downhill\" towards the MEP without being pulled back towards the minima by the component of the true force along the path, and that they remain evenly distributed along the path.\n\nThe force on a regular NEB image $\\mathbf{r}_i$ is:\n$$\n\\mathbf{F}_{\\text{NEB},i} = \\mathbf{F}_{\\text{true},i}^{\\perp} + \\mathbf{F}_{\\text{spring},i}^{\\parallel}\n$$\n\nTo calculate these components, we first need the local tangent vector to the path at image $\\mathbf{r}_i$, denoted by $\\hat{\\tau}_i$. A robust estimate is given by the normalized vector connecting its neighbors:\n$$\n\\hat{\\tau}_i = \\frac{\\mathbf{r}_{i+1} - \\mathbf{r}_{i-1}}{|\\mathbf{r}_{i+1} - \\mathbf{r}_{i-1}|}\n$$\n\nThe perpendicular component of the true force is obtained by projecting out the parallel component:\n$$\n\\mathbf{F}_{\\text{true},i}^{\\perp} = \\mathbf{F}_{\\text{true},i} - (\\mathbf{F}_{\\text{true},i} \\cdot \\hat{\\tau}_i) \\hat{\\tau}_i\n$$\nwhere $\\mathbf{F}_{\\text{true},i} = -\\nabla V(\\mathbf{r}_i)$.\n\nThe spring force between images is modeled as ideal springs connecting adjacent images. The net spring force on image $\\mathbf{r}_i$ is $\\mathbf{F}_{\\text{spring},i} = k(\\mathbf{r}_{i+1} - 2\\mathbf{r}_i + \\mathbf{r}_{i-1})$, where $k$ is the spring constant.

The Climbing-Image (CI) Modification**\n\nTo accurately locate the saddle point, the CI-NEB method modifies the force on the image with the highest potential energy. Let this image be $\\mathbf{r}_{i_{\\text{max}}}$. For this \"climbing image\", the spring force is removed, and the parallel component of the true force is inverted. This drives the image uphill along the path towards the true saddle point, while still relaxing it perpendicular to the path.\n\nThe force on the climbing image is:\n$$\n\\mathbf{F}_{\\text{CI}, i_{\\text{max}}} = \\mathbf{F}_{\\text{true},i_{\\text{max}}}^{\\perp} - \\mathbf{F}_{\\text{true},i_{\\text{max}}}^{\\parallel} = \\mathbf{F}_{\\text{true},i_{\\text{max}}} - 2(\\mathbf{F}_{\\text{true},i_{\\text{max}}} \\cdot \\hat{\\tau}_{i_{\\text{max}}}) \\hat{\\tau}_{i_{\\text{max}}}\n$$\n\n**4. Computational Algorithm**\n\nThe path is relaxed using an iterative optimization scheme. A simple and effective method is steepest descent, where each intermediate image is moved in the direction of its calculated NEB force.\n\nThe algorithm proceeds as follows:\n1. Initialize the path with $M$ images via linear interpolation.\n2. Begin the iterative loop:\n   a. For each image, compute its energy $V(\\mathbf{r}_i)$ and the true force $\\mathbf{F}_{\\text{true},i}$.\n   b. Identify the index $i_{\\text{max}}$ of the intermediate image with the highest energy.\n   c. For each intermediate image $i \\in \\{1, \\dots, M-2\\}$, calculate the tangent $\\hat{\\tau}_i$.\n   d. For each intermediate image $i$, compute the NEB force: $\\mathbf{F}_{\\text{CI}, i}$ if $i=i_{\\text{max}}$, and $\\mathbf{F}_{\\text{NEB},i}$ otherwise.\n   e. Update the positions of the intermediate images: $\\mathbf{r}_i \\leftarrow \\mathbf{r}_i + \\alpha \\mathbf{F}_i$, where $\\alpha$ is a small, fixed step size (learning rate) and $\\mathbf{F}_i$ is the appropriate force from step (d).\n   f. Check for convergence. The loop terminates when the maximum magnitude of the force on any intermediate image falls below a tolerance, $|\\mathbf{F}_i|_{\\text{max}} < 10^{-6}$ eV/Å, or a maximum of $20000$ iterations is reached.\n3. After convergence, the energy barrier $\\Delta E$ is the difference between the maximum energy along the final path and the energy of the initial state, $\\Delta E = \\max_i(V(\\mathbf{r}_i)) - V(\\mathbf{r}_0)$.\n4. The saddle point is the image on the converged path with the highest energy. The value $\\Delta x$ is the $x$-coordinate of this saddle-point image.\n\nThis procedure is implemented for each test case to determine the required outputs.", "answer": "```python\nimport numpy as np\nimport math\n\n# Define global constants as specified in the problem statement.\nTOLERANCE = 1e-6\nMAX_ITERATIONS = 20000\n# A fixed step size for the steepest descent optimizer.\n# This value is chosen to be small enough for stability across all test cases.\nSTEP_SIZE = 0.01\n\ndef potential(coords, V0, a):\n    \"\"\"\n    Computes the potential energy V(x, y) for a set of coordinates.\n    The function is vectorized to handle an array of coordinates.\n    \"\"\"\n    x = coords[..., 0]\n    y = coords[..., 1]\n    term_x = np.cos(2 * np.pi * x / a)\n    term_y = np.cos(2 * np.pi * y / a)\n    return V0 * (2.0 - term_x - term_y)\n\ndef gradient(coords, V0, a):\n    \"\"\"\n    Computes the gradient of the potential V(x, y) for a set of coordinates.\n    The function is vectorized.\n    \"\"\"\n    x = coords[..., 0]\n    y = coords[..., 1]\n    factor = 2.0 * np.pi * V0 / a\n    grad_x = factor * np.sin(2.0 * np.pi * x / a)\n    grad_y = factor * np.sin(2.0 * np.pi * y / a)\n    # Stack the components to return a gradient vector for each coordinate pair.\n    return np.stack((grad_x, grad_y), axis=-1)\n\ndef run_ci_neb(V0, a, k, M):\n    \"\"\"\n    Performs a Climbing-Image Nudged Elastic Band calculation.\n    \n    Args:\n        V0 (float): Corrugation amplitude in eV.\n        a (float): Lattice parameter in Å.\n        k (float): Spring constant in eV/Å^2.\n        M (int): Total number of images in the band.\n\n    Returns:\n        list: A list containing [delta_E, delta_x] rounded to 6 decimal places.\n    \"\"\"\n    # 1.
