This approximation is valid when the radius of curvature of the sphere is much larger than the separation distance, i.e., $R \\gg D$. It equates the total interaction energy, which we denote as $V_{\\mathrm{sp}}(D)$, to the integral of the planar interaction energy over the projected area. We imagine slicing the sphere into infinitesimal, concentric annular rings of radius $r$ and width $dr$. The area of each ring is $dS = 2 \\pi r dr$. The separation distance $z$ between a ring at radius $r$ and the plane is not uniform; it is given by $z(r) = D + y(r)$, where $y(r)$ is the height of the sphere's surface above its apex. For a sphere, $y(r) = R - \\sqrt{R^2 - r^2}$. Since $R \\gg r$ for the relevant interaction region, we can use the binomial approximation: $y(r) \\approx \\frac{r^2}{2R}$. Thus, the local separation is $z(r) \\approx D + \\frac{r^2}{2R}$.\n\nThe total interaction energy is then:\n$$\nV_{\\mathrm{sp}}(D) = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} W(z(r)) \\cdot 2 \\pi r \\, dr\n$$\nSubstituting the expressions for $W(D)$ and $z(r)$:\n$$\nV_{\\mathrm{sp}}(D) = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\left( -\\frac{A}{12 \\pi \\left(D + \\frac{r^2}{2R}\\right)^2} \\right) 2 \\pi r \\, dr = -\\frac{A}{6} \\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\frac{r}{\\left(D + \\frac{r^2}{2R}\\right)^2} dr\n$$\nTo solve this integral, we perform a change of variables.

We address each force component separately.\n\n1.  Capillary Adhesion Force, $F_{\\mathrm{cap}}$\nThe formation of a liquid meniscus between two surfaces gives rise to an attractive capillary force. This force originates from two contributions: a pressure deficit (Laplace pressure) within the liquid bridge and the vertical component of the surface tension acting along the contact line. The problem asks for a leading-order expression in the limit where the Kelvin radius is much smaller than the sphere radius, $r_k \\ll R$.\n\nIn this limit, and for small separations between the sphere and the plane, the maximum adhesive force (or pull-off force) is given by a well-established formula derived from either force balance or energy minimization arguments. We will use this standard result, which is appropriate for the given context. The force is expressed as:\n$$F_{\\mathrm{cap}} = 4 \\pi R \\gamma \\cos\\theta$$\nThis expression assumes the force is dominated by the surface tension component projected along the axis of symmetry and is evaluated at or near zero separation, where the adhesion is typically maximal.

Van der Waals Adhesion Force, $F_{\\mathrm{vdW}}$\nThe problem requires the non-retarded van der Waals force between a sphere of radius $R$ and a flat plane at an equilibrium separation $D_0$. This force can be calculated by integrating the pairwise atomic interactions over the volumes of the two bodies. A direct and accurate method for the geometry where the separation is much smaller than the sphere radius ($D_0 \\ll R$) is the Derjaguin approximation.\n\nThe Derjaguin approximation relates the interaction force $F(D_0)$ between two curved bodies to the interaction energy per unit area, $w(z)$, between two infinite parallel plates. For a sphere and a plane, the relation is:\n$$F(D_0) = 2 \\pi R w(D_0)$$\nThe non-retarded van der Waals interaction energy per unit area between two parallel plates separated by a distance $z$ is given by:\n$$w(z) = -\\frac{A_H}{12 \\pi z^2}$$\nwhere $A_H$ is the Hamaker constant.\n\nSubstituting $w(D_0)$ into the Derjaguin formula gives the interaction force at separation $D_0$.
