To achieve continuous, stick-slip–free sliding, the potential energy landscape $W(x)$ must possess only a single minimum for any given $x_s$. This condition is guaranteed if $W(x)$ is a convex function of $x$ for all $x_s$. A function is convex if its second derivative is non-negative everywhere.\n\nWe calculate the second derivative of $W(x)$ with respect to $x$:\n$$\\frac{d^2W}{dx^2} = \\frac{d^2U}{dx^2} + k$$\nThe condition for the absence of metastability becomes:\n$$\\frac{d^2U}{dx^2} + k \\ge 0 \\quad \\forall x$$\nThis inequality can be rewritten as:\n$$k \\ge -\\frac{d^2U}{dx^2}$$\nTo ensure this condition holds for all positions $x$, the spring stiffness $k$ must be greater than or equal to the maximum possible value of $-\\frac{d^2U}{dx^2}$.

The setup describes a canonical model used to study friction at the nanoscale, for example, graphene on graphite or hexagonal boron nitride (with the idealization of identical lattice constants). The problem is well-posed; it provides sufficient physical and mathematical constraints to deduce the symmetry properties of the static friction force. The language is objective and precise. The problem is formalizable and solvable using principles of solid-state physics and group theory. The idealization of rigid lattices is a standard and acceptable simplification for elucidating symmetry-based effects. The problem statement is therefore valid.\n\n**Derivation**\n\nThe static friction amplitude $F_{\\mathrm{s}}(\\theta)$ is specified to be proportional to the corrugation of the interfacial energy $E(\\mathbf{R},\\theta)$. The corrugation, $\\Delta E(\\theta)$, is the difference between the maximum and minimum energy as the island translates over the substrate at a fixed angle $\\theta$:\n$$ \\Delta E(\\theta) = \\max_{\\mathbf{R}} E(\\mathbf{R},\\theta) - \\min_{\\mathbf{R}} E(\\mathbf{R},\\theta) $$\nThus, $F_{\\mathrm{s}}(\\theta) \\propto \\Delta E(\\theta)$. We must determine the properties of this function based on the system's symmetry.\n\nThe island and substrate both possess a hexagonal Bravais lattice. The point group symmetry for a two-dimensional hexagonal lattice is $D_6$ (or $6mm$ in Hermann-Mauguin notation). This group includes a six-fold rotation axis ($C_6$) and mirror planes.\n\n**(i) Fundamental Angular Period**\nThe total interaction energy of the system depends only on the relative positions of the atoms of the island and the substrate. Let the system be in a configuration specified by the rotation angle $\\theta$. Now, consider a new configuration where the island is rotated to an angle $\\theta' = \\theta + 60^\\circ$. A rotation of the island by $60^\\circ$ is a symmetry operation of its own lattice. This means that an island rotated by $\\theta + 60^\\circ$ is physically indistinguishable from an island rotated by $\\theta$. Since the substrate also has $60^\\circ$ rotational symmetry, the physical situation is identical.\n\nMore formally, the interaction energy landscape $E(\\mathbf{R}, \\theta)$ must remain unchanged if we apply a symmetry operation to the entire system. Let us rotate the substrate by $60^\\circ$; it is unchanged. The island is now at an angle $\\theta$ relative to a physically identical substrate. This is equivalent to keeping the substrate fixed and rotating the island from $\\theta$ to $\\theta + 60^\\circ$. Therefore, the energy corrugation must be the same:\n$$ \\Delta E(\\theta) = \\Delta E(\\theta + 60^\\circ) $$\nThis implies that $F_{\\mathrm{s}}(\\theta)$ is a periodic function of $\\theta$ with a period that must be a divisor of $60^\\circ$. A rotation by $30^\\circ$ is not a symmetry operation of the hexagonal Bravais lattice point group $D_6$. Therefore, the fundamental period cannot be smaller than $60^\\circ$ based on the given symmetry constraints. The fundamental period is $60^\\circ$.\n\n**(ii) Even/Odd Function Property**\nWe must compare $F_{\\mathrm{s}}(\\theta)$ with $F_{\\mathrm{s}}(-\\theta)$. A configuration at angle $-\\theta$ is the mirror image of a configuration at angle $\\theta$ through a reflection plane (e.g., one passing through $\\theta=0$). The hexagonal lattice is invariant under such reflections (it has mirror planes as part of its $D_6$ symmetry). Since the forces are conservative and depend only on interatomic distances, the energy $E$ is a scalar quantity that is invariant under such global reflection operations. A reflection operation maps the state $(\\mathbf{R}, \\theta)$ to a state $(\\sigma\\mathbf{R}, -\\theta)$, where $\\sigma$ is the reflection matrix. The set of energy values sampled by translating over the unit cell for the angle $-\\theta$, $\\{E(\\mathbf{R'}, -\\theta)\\}$, is identical to the set of energy values for the angle $\\theta$, $\\{E(\\mathbf{R}, \\theta)\\}$. Consequently, the energy corrugation must be the same for $\\theta$ and $-\\theta$:\n$$ \\Delta E(\\theta) = \\Delta E(-\\theta) $$\nThis shows that $F_{\\mathrm{s}}(\\theta)$ must be an even function of $\\theta$.\n\n**(iii) Commensurate Locking Angles**\nThe energy corrugation $\\Delta E(\\theta)$, and thus the static friction $F_{\\mathrm{s}}(\\theta)$, is maximized when the island and substrate lattices are in registry. For two identical lattices, maximum registry occurs when they are perfectly aligned. This corresponds to the commensurate angle $\\theta = 0^\\circ$. At this orientation, it is possible to translate the island to achieve states of high energy (e.g., atoms directly on top of substrate atoms) and low energy (e.g., atoms in the hollow sites of the substrate lattice), leading to a large energy variation. Due to the $60^\\circ$ periodicity, these maxima in $F_{\\mathrm{s}}(\\theta)$ must occur at all angles $\\theta = 0^\\circ + 60^\\circ k$ for any integer $k$.\n\nConversely, the energy corrugation is minimized in incommensurate structures, where the lack of a common periodicity leads to a cancellation of lateral forces, a phenomenon known as structural superlubricity. For two hexagonal lattices, the most incommensurate orientation, which leads to the strongest suppression of the corrugation potential, is known to occur at or near the angle that bisects the high-symmetry directions, i.e., $\\theta=30^\\circ$. At this angle, the lattices are maximally misaligned, leading to a minimal energy corrugation. By periodicity, these minima occur at $\\theta = 30^\\circ + 60^\\circ k$.\n\n**Evaluation of Options**\n\n*   **A. $F_{\\mathrm{s}}(\\theta)$ is periodic in $\\theta$ with period $60^\\circ$, is an even function of $\\theta$, and exhibits maxima at $\\theta = 0^\\circ + 60^\\circ k$ for integer $k$ (commensurate locking), with minima near $\\theta = 30^\\circ + 60^\\circ k$ where incommensurability leads to structural superlubricity.**\n    This statement correctly identifies the period as $60^\\circ$ from $C_6$ symmetry, the even function nature from reflection symmetry, the locking angles at $\\theta = 0^\\circ + 60^\\circ k$ from commensurate registry, and the superlubric angles near $\\theta = 30^\\circ + 60^\\circ k$ from incommensurability. This is consistent with our derivation. **Correct**.\n\n*   **B. $F_{\\mathrm{s}}(\\theta)$ has a fundamental period of $30^\\circ$ due to the honeycomb basis, with equivalent orientations every $30^\\circ$, and locks at $\\theta = 15^\\circ + 30^\\circ k$ where the basis atoms align most closely.**\n    The fundamental period cannot be $30^\\circ$ as a $30^\\circ$ rotation is not a symmetry of the hexagonal Bravais lattice point group $D_6$. The reference to the \"honeycomb basis\" is a distraction; the problem explicitly states to use the symmetry of the Bravais lattice. The locking angles are also incorrect. **Incorrect**.\n\n*   **C. For a sufficiently large island, $F_{\\mathrm{s}}(\\theta)$ becomes isotropic in $\\theta$ because the angular average over many domains suppresses any anisotropy; there are no distinct locking angles.**\n    This is a flawed argument. While friction is suppressed for a large island at *incommensurate* angles, it is maximized at *commensurate* angles. The distinction is crucial and defines the anisotropy. The problem also specifies a \"single-domain\" flake, so there is no averaging over domains. **Incorrect**.\n\n*   **D. When lattice constants are equal and mirror symmetry holds, $F_{\\mathrm{s}}(\\theta)$ has period $60^\\circ$ but its maxima occur at $\\theta = 30^\\circ + 60^\\circ k$ because that angle yields the largest number of coincidence sites and thus the strongest registry.**\n    The period is correct, but the location of the maxima is wrong. The angle $\\theta=30^\\circ$ corresponds to a highly incommensurate state, leading to minimal, not maximal, corrugation and friction. This angle minimizes, rather than maximizes, registry for identical lattices. **Incorrect**.\n\n*   **E. $F_{\\mathrm{s}}(\\theta)$ has a fundamental period of $120^\\circ$, with commensurate locking at $\\theta = 0^\\circ, 120^\\circ, 240^\\circ$, and minima at $\\theta = 60^\\circ$ where inversion symmetry frustrates registry.**\n    The period is incorrect. The lattice has $C_6$ symmetry, not just $C_3$, so the period must be $60^\\circ$. Furthermore, $\\theta = 60^\\circ$ is a commensurate angle identical to $\\theta = 0^\\circ$ and must be a maximum of friction, not a minimum. **Incorrect**.\n\nBased on a rigorous application of symmetry principles, only statement A provides a correct description of the angular anisotropy of the static friction.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2789016"}, {"introduction": "Idealized models often assume infinite surfaces, but real-world nanoscale systems are finite.

It is a valid problem of theoretical physics. I will now proceed with the solution.\n\nThe state of the system is determined by the displacement field $u(\\mathbf{r})$ that minimizes the total energy functional. The total energy $E_{total}$ is the sum of the elastic energy stored in the flake, $E_{el}$, and the potential energy of interaction with the substrate, $E_{int}$.\n\nThe elastic energy per unit area for an in-plane shear deformation is proportional to the shear modulus $G$ and the square of the strain tensor. For a thin flake of thickness $t$, the total elastic energy is:\n$$ E_{el}[u] = \\frac{1}{2} G t \\int_{\\mathcal{A}} (\\nabla u(\\mathbf{r}))^2 d^2\\mathbf{r} $$\nwhere $\\nabla u$ represents the spatial gradient of the displacement field, which is related to the elastic strain.\n\nThe interfacial energy is the integral of the periodic substrate potential $V(\\mathbf{x})$ over the contact area. The position of an atom in the flake is $\\mathbf{r} + u(\\mathbf{r})$, where $\\mathbf{r}$ is its undeformed lattice position. The potential energy is:\n$$ E_{int}[u] = \\int_{\\mathcal{A}} V(\\mathbf{r} + u(\\mathbf{r})) d^2\\mathbf{r} $$\nThe potential $V$ has a characteristic amplitude related to $V_0$ and a periodicity $a$. Due to the incommensurability, the phase of the potential varies rapidly with position $\\mathbf{r}$.\n\nThe equilibrium displacement field $u(\\mathbf{r})$ is the one that minimizes $E_{total} = E_{el} + E_{int}$. Static friction force $F$ is the maximum possible lateral force that the interface can sustain, which corresponds to the energy barrier that must be overcome to initiate sliding. This is determined by the variation of the minimized energy $E_{min}$ with respect to a global shift of the flake.\n\nThe core of the problem is the competition between these two energy terms. To minimize $E_{el}$, the flake must remain undeformed, i.e., $u(\\mathbf{r}) = \\text{constant}$. To minimize $E_{int}$, the flake atoms would ideally sit in the potential minima of the substrate, requiring a spatially varying displacement field $u(\\mathbf{r})$ that matches the substrate periodicity, which is impossible for an incommensurate system and would incur a large elastic energy cost.\n\nIn the bulk of a large flake (far from the edges), the system resolves this conflict in favor of minimizing the elastic energy. The elastic cost to deform the flake on the short length scale $a$ of the substrate potential is prohibitively high for a reasonably stiff material. Therefore, in the interior of the flake, $u(\\mathbf{r})$ is nearly constant. For a constant $u$, the interfacial force, $f_{int} \\propto \\nabla V(\\mathbf{r} + u)$, oscillates rapidly with position $\\mathbf{r}$ due to the incommensurability. When integrated over any macroscopic area in the bulk, this force effectively averages to zero. This is the \"phase cancellation\" mentioned in the problem statement.\n\nHowever, this cancellation mechanism relies on translational symmetry. At the edges of the flake, this symmetry is broken. Atoms near the boundary do not have neighboring atoms on all sides to enforce a flat, undeformed state. This allows the flake to elastically relax near the edges and partially conform to the substrate potential, thereby lowering its interfacial energy. This relaxation is not perfect and is localized within a boundary layer of some characteristic width, $\\lambda_M$. This width, sometimes called the elastic coherence length, is determined by the intrinsic properties of the system: the flake stiffness $G t$ and the interfacial potential strength $V_0/a^2$. Importantly, $\\lambda_M$ does not depend on the overall size of the flake, $L$.\n\nThe static friction force arises primarily from the force required to depin these relaxed edge regions. The bulk of the flake, being in a low-energy, cancelled-force state, contributes negligibly to the static friction. Therefore, the total friction force $F$ is dominated by the contribution from the boundary layer. The size of this region is its length, which is the perimeter of the flake $\\mathcal{P}$, multiplied by its width $\\lambda_M$. As the force per unit length of the edge region is an intrinsic property, the total force scales with the length of the edge region:\n$$ F \\propto \\mathcal{P} $$\nFor a family of geometrically similar shapes, the perimeter scales linearly with the characteristic size $L$, i.e., $\\mathcal{P} \\propto L$. The area scales as $\\mathcal{A} \\propto L^2$.\nThe average shear stress $\\tau$, which is the quantity often identified with friction in experiments, is defined as the total force divided by the total area:\n$$ \\tau = \\frac{F}{\\mathcal{A}} $$\nSubstituting the scaling relations, we find:\n$$ \\tau \\propto \\frac{\\mathcal{P}}{\\mathcal{A}} \\propto \\frac{L}{L^2} = L^{-1} $$\nThis result, that the friction stress decreases with increasing contact size, is a defining characteristic of structural superlubricity for finite contacts. The dominant contribution from edges and corners (which are sharp features of the perimeter) is the physical origin of this scaling.\n\nWe now evaluate the given options based on this derivation.\n\n**A. In an incommensurate, elastically stiff flake, the interior can locally relax to cancel lateral tractions, while translational symmetry breaking at the boundary leaves a finite boundary layer (of width that is set by material parameters and does not grow with $L$). The net lateral force is dominated by edge and corner regions and scales with $\\mathcal{P}$, implying $F \\propto \\mathcal{P}$ and the average shear stress $\\tau \\equiv F/\\mathcal{A} \\propto \\mathcal{P}/\\mathcal{A} \\sim L^{-1}$ for similar shapes.**\nThis option accurately describes the physical mechanism derived above. It correctly identifies the bulk cancellation, the symmetry breaking at the boundary, the formation of a boundary layer of intrinsic width, the resulting perimeter-scaling of the force ($F \\propto \\mathcal{P}$), and the subsequent area-scaling of the average stress ($\\tau \\propto L^{-1}$). The statement is entirely consistent with the first-principles argument.\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\n**B. Incommensurability cancels lateral forces everywhere, including boundaries, so friction is controlled only by thermal activation. Consequently $F$ is set by $k_{\\mathrm{B}} T$ and does not scale with $\\mathcal{P}$ or $\\mathcal{A}$; edges and corners are negligible.**\nThis statement is fundamentally flawed. Its central premise, \"cancels lateral forces everywhere, including boundaries,\" is incorrect. The cancellation is a bulk effect and fails at the boundaries due to broken symmetry. This failure at the edges is the primary source of static friction in this regime. Dismissing the role of edges is a grave error. While thermal activation can contribute to sliding, the problem specifies a regime limited by *elastic accommodation*, which points to the static potential energy landscape, an athermal concept.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**C. The net lateral force adds incoherently over $N \\sim \\mathcal{A}/a^{2}$ atoms, giving $F \\propto \\sqrt{N} \\propto \\sqrt{\\mathcal{A}}$ regardless of elastic compliance. Edges and corners are irrelevant to the scaling.**\nThis describes a model for a completely rigid flake where atomic forces add as random variables. This leads to a \"random walk\" sum, resulting in $F \\propto \\sqrt{\\mathcal{A}}$. This model explicitly ignores elastic compliance, contradicting the problem statement which requires consideration of elastic deformation (`u(\\mathbf{r})` minimizes sum of elastic and potential energy). Elasticity is precisely what enables the edge relaxation that leads to the perimeter-dominated friction. Claiming that edges are irrelevant is in direct opposition to the correct physical picture for this regime.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. Under any finite $p$, the flake tilts to create commensurate patches that nucleate at edges and spread so that their total area is proportional to $\\mathcal{A}$; thus $F \\propto \\mathcal{A}$ and a perimeter-to-area argument generically fails even in the structural superlubric regime.**\nThis option describes a scenario that is the antithesis of structural superlubricity. The formation of large, stable commensurate domains that scale with the total area $\\mathcal{A}$ signifies a transition to a high-friction, pinned state where $F \\propto \\mathcal{A}$. The problem, however, is explicitly set in the \"structural superlubric regime,\" where such pinning is largely absent and low-friction sliding is possible. Therefore, this option describes a different, high-friction physical regime and is not a valid explanation for the mechanism of superlubricity.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2789118"}]}
