The formation of a vacancy changes the Gibbs free energy of the crystal. The Gibbs free energy of formation is $G_f = E_f - T S_f$, where $E_f$ is the vacancy formation energy and $S_f$ is the vacancy formation entropy. The problem specifies that the formation entropy contribution is negligible, which simplifies the free energy to $G_f \\approx E_f$. The equilibrium fraction of vacant lattice sites, $X_v$, is given by the Boltzmann factor for creating a defect:\n$$X_v = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{G_f}{k_B T}\\right) \\approx \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_f}{k_B T}\\right)$$\nHere, $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant and $T$ is the absolute temperature. This expression is valid for a dilute concentration of vacancies, $X_v \\ll 1$, an assumption given in the problem.\n\nSecond, we formulate the rate of atomic jumps. An atom can diffuse only if an adjacent lattice site is vacant. The rate at which a specific atom jumps into a specific neighboring vacancy is given by transition-state theory. This jump rate, $\\omega$, is characterized by an activation energy barrier, the migration energy $E_m$, and an attempt frequency, $\\nu$.\n$$\\omega = \\nu \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_m}{k_B T}\\right)$$\nThe total jump frequency of a tracer atom, $\\Gamma_T$, is the product of this intrinsic jump rate, $\\omega$, and the probability that a neighboring site is vacant. For a face-centered cubic (FCC) lattice, each atom has $z=12$ nearest neighbors. In the dilute limit, the probability of finding a vacancy at any one of the $z$ neighboring sites is $z X_v$. Therefore, the total jump frequency for a tracer atom is:\n$$\\Gamma_T = z X_v \\omega$$\nSubstituting the expressions for $X_v$ and $\\omega$:\n$$\\Gamma_T = z \\nu \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_f}{k_B T}\\right) \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_m}{k_B T}\\right) = z \\nu \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_f + E_m}{k_B T}\\right)$$\n\nThird, we use the Einstein relation for diffusion in a three-dimensional crystal lattice. The diffusion coefficient, $D$, is related to the mean squared jump distance, $d^2$, and the jump frequency, $\\Gamma$, by:\n$$D = \\frac{1}{6} \\Gamma d^2$$\nFor tracer diffusion, we must account for the fact that successive jumps of an atom via the vacancy mechanism are not independent. A tracer atom that has just exchanged with a vacancy has a higher-than-random probability of jumping back into the same vacancy. This correlation reduces the net displacement. The effect is quantified by the correlation factor, $f$. The tracer self-diffusion coefficient $D_T$ is thus:\n$$D_T = \\frac{1}{6} f \\Gamma_T d^2$$\n\nFor the FCC lattice, the nearest-neighbor jump distance $d$ is half the diagonal of a face of the conventional cubic cell. This relates $d$ to the lattice parameter $a$ as $d = a/\\sqrt{2}$.

Thus, the net removal rate is proportional to the deviation from equilibrium concentration. The proportionality constant connecting the sink strength $k^2$ (units of length$^{-2}$) and diffusivity $D_v$ (units of length$^2$/time) to a rate (units of time$^{-1}$) is $D_v k^2$.
