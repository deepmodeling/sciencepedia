The displacement field $\\mathbf{u}$ has only a single non-zero component, $u_z$, which is a function of the position in the $xy$-plane. Due to the cylindrical symmetry of the problem, it is most convenient to work in cylindrical coordinates $(r, \\theta, z)$. The displacement field is therefore of the form $\\mathbf{u}(r, \\theta) = u_z(r, \\theta) \\mathbf{\\hat{k}}$, with $u_r = 0$ and $u_\\theta = 0$.\n\nThe Burgers vector $\\mathbf{b}$ is defined by the closure failure of a Burgers circuit, which is a line integral of the displacement gradient around a closed loop $C$ encircling the dislocation line:\n$$ \\mathbf{b} = \\oint_C d\\mathbf{u} $$\nFor a screw dislocation along the $z$-axis, the Burgers vector is $\\mathbf{b} = b\\mathbf{\\hat{k}}$, where $b$ is its magnitude.

This singularity is a non-physical artifact of the linear continuum model, which breaks down near the dislocation line where strains are large. At $r = 1 \\, \\mathrm{nm}$ (which corresponds to $4b$), the calculated stress of $1590 \\, \\mathrm{MPa}$ is very high, approaching the theoretical shear strength of a perfect crystal (typically of order $\\mu/10$, which is $4 \\, \\mathrm{GPa}$). This indicates that this distance is at the boundary of the region where linear elasticity is valid. At $r = 10 \\, \\mathrm{nm}$ (or $40b$), the stress has decayed by an order of magnitude to $159 \\, \\mathrm{MPa}$, a value where the linear elastic description is much more reliable. This comparison clearly illustrates the concept of scale separation. There is a dislocation \"core\" region (of size a few $b$) where atomic-scale modeling is required due to large, non-linear deformations, and a \"far-field\" region where the continuum elastic solution provides an accurate description of the stress and strain fields. The results show the rapid decay of stress away from the core, justifying this two-scale treatment of dislocations in materials science.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 1590 & 159 \\end{pmatrix}}\n$$", "id": "2768874"}, {"introduction": "The stress fields of individual dislocations superimpose, giving rise to complex interaction forces that govern their collective behavior and the material's mechanical response.
