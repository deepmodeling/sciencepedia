A crystalline solid with an HCP structure.\n2.  The underlying Bravais lattice is hexagonal.\n3.

The vectors $\\mathbf{a}_{1}$ and $\\mathbf{a}_{2}$ are in the basal plane with $|\\mathbf{a}_{1}| = |\\mathbf{a}_{2}| = a$ and the angle between them is $60^{\\circ}$, which is characteristic of a hexagonal lattice. The vector $\\mathbf{a}_{3}$ is orthogonal to the basal plane. The basis coordinates are a valid choice for describing the HCP stacking. The problem is well-posed and provides all necessary information. Although the problem uses the term \"conventional crystallographic hexagonal cell\" to describe a cell that is in fact a primitive cell of the hexagonal Bravais lattice, the wording \"be defined by\" establishes a local definition that must be strictly followed. The problem is therefore valid.\n\nThe solution proceeds in two parts.\n\nPart 1: Determination of the number of atoms $N$ in the defined unit cell.\nThe crystal structure is generated by placing the two-atom basis at every point of the hexagonal Bravais lattice. The lattice points are given by vectors $\\mathbf{R} = n_1\\mathbf{a}_1 + n_2\\mathbf{a}_2 + n_3\\mathbf{a}_3$ for integers $n_1, n_2, n_3$.\nThe unit cell is the parallelepiped spanned by the vectors $\\mathbf{a}_1, \\mathbf{a}_2, \\mathbf{a}_3$. By its definition, it has lattice points only at its vertices. A cell with lattice points only at its corners is a primitive cell. A primitive cell contains exactly one lattice point. This can be confirmed by counting the contribution of the vertices to a single cell: there are $8$ vertices, each shared by $8$ adjacent cells. The total number of lattice points per cell is $8 \\times \\frac{1}{8} = 1$.\n\nThe total number of atoms in the cell is the number of lattice points per cell multiplied by the number of atoms in the basis.\nAlternatively, and more rigorously, we can count the atoms whose positions lie within the volume of the cell. The cell can be defined as the set of points $\\mathbf{P} = u_1\\mathbf{a}_1 + u_2\\mathbf{a}_2 + u_3\\mathbf{a}_3$ where $0 \\le u_i < 1$ for $i=1, 2, 3$.\n\nThe positions of the atoms in the crystal are given by $\\mathbf{P}_{n,i} = \\mathbf{R}_n + \\mathbf{p}_i$, where $\\mathbf{R}_n$ is a lattice vector and $\\mathbf{p}_i$ are the basis position vectors.\nThe basis vectors are $\\mathbf{p}_1 = 0\\mathbf{a}_1 + 0\\mathbf{a}_2 + 0\\mathbf{a}_3$ and $\\mathbf{p}_2 = \\frac{2}{3}\\mathbf{a}_1 + \\frac{1}{3}\\mathbf{a}_2 + \\frac{1}{2}\\mathbf{a}_3$.\n\nThe first set of atoms are located at the lattice points themselves (since $\\mathbf{p}_1 = \\mathbf{0}$). As established, the cell contains a total of one atom from this set. This accounts for the shared atoms at the corners.\n\nThe second set of atoms are located at positions $\\mathbf{R}_n + \\mathbf{p}_2$. We must find how many of these are inside our specific cell defined by $0 \\le u_i < 1$. We consider the atom associated with the lattice origin $\\mathbf{R}_0 = \\mathbf{0}$. Its position is $\\mathbf{p}_2$. The fractional coordinates of this atom are given as $\\left(\\frac{2}{3}, \\frac{1}{3}, \\frac{1}{2}\\right)$. Since these coordinates $u_1 = \\frac{2}{3}$, $u_2 = \\frac{1}{3}$, and $u_3 = \\frac{1}{2}$ all satisfy the condition $0 \\le u_i < 1$, this atom lies entirely inside the unit cell. It is not shared with any other cell. Thus, it contributes a full count of $1$ to the total number of atoms in the cell.\n\nThe total number of atoms $N$ in the defined unit cell is the sum of contributions from both sets of atoms:\n$$N = 1 (\\text{from basis atom 1}) + 1 (\\text{from basis atom 2}) = 2$$\n\nPart 2: Determination of the volume per atom $V_{\\text{atom}}$.\nFirst, we calculate the volume of the unit cell, $V_{\\text{cell}}$. The volume of the parallelepiped spanned by $\\mathbf{a}_1, \\mathbf{a}_2, \\mathbf{a}_3$ is given by the absolute value of their scalar triple product, $V_{\\text{cell}} = |\\mathbf{a}_3 \\cdot (\\mathbf{a}_1 \\times \\mathbf{a}_2)|$.\nWe express the vectors in Cartesian coordinates:\n$$\n\\mathbf{a}_{1} = (a, 0, 0) \\\\\n\\mathbf{a}_{2} = \\left(\\frac{a}{2}, \\frac{a\\sqrt{3}}{2}, 0\\right) \\\\\n\\mathbf{a}_{3} = (0, 0, c)\n$$\nThe scalar triple product is calculated as the determinant of the matrix whose rows are these vectors:\n$$\nV_{\\text{cell}} = \\left| \\det \\begin{pmatrix} a & 0 & 0 \\\\ \\frac{a}{2} & \\frac{a\\sqrt{3}}{2} & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & c \\end{pmatrix} \\right|\n$$\nThe determinant of this upper-triangular matrix is the product of its diagonal elements:\n$$\n\\det = a \\cdot \\left( \\frac{a\\sqrt{3}}{2} \\right) \\cdot c = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}a^2 c\n$$\nSince $a > 0$ and $c > 0$, the volume is positive.\n$$\nV_{\\text{cell}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}a^2 c\n$$\nThe volume per atom, $V_{\\text{atom}}$, is the total volume of the cell divided by the number of atoms it contains:\n$$\nV_{\\text{atom}} = \\frac{V_{\\text{cell}}}{N}\n$$\nSubstituting the calculated values for $V_{\\text{cell}}$ and $N$:\n$$\nV_{\\text{atom}} = \\frac{\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}a^2 c}{2} = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{4}a^2 c\n$$\nThe problem requires the result to be expressed as a single row matrix $\\begin{pmatrix}N & V_{\\text{atom}}\\end{pmatrix}$.\nThe final result is thus $\\begin{pmatrix}2 & \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{4}a^2 c\\end{pmatrix}$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 2 & \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{4} a^{2} c \\end{pmatrix}}\n$$", "id": "2767901"}, {"introduction": "While the real-space lattice describes atomic positions, the reciprocal lattice is indispensable for understanding wave phenomena in crystals, such as diffraction.

If $A$ and $B$ are different scatterers, the crystal cannot be represented as a body-centered cubic Bravais lattice with a single-atom basis, because a single-atom basis would imply translational equivalence of all sites. In that incorrect representation, systematic absences would be independent of $f_A,f_B$, which contradicts the explicit dependence of $F_{hkl}$ on $f_A$ and $f_B$ derived above.

Bragg peak positions remain at the reciprocal-lattice vectors $\\mathbf{G}_{hkl} = \\tfrac{2\\pi}{a}(h,k,l)$ of the simple cubic reciprocal lattice; there is no uniform shift to $(h/2,k/2,l/2)$.
