This is a Lorentzian function with a finite full-width at half-maximum (FWHM) of $\\Gamma$. The finite width implies a finite lifetime $\\tau = \\hbar/\\Gamma$, due to the decay of the surface-localized excitation into the continuum of bulk states via the coupling $t_s$. This decay process is precisely what is described by Fermi's Golden Rule, where the transition rate ($\\propto \\Gamma$) is proportional to the square of the coupling matrix element ($|t_s|^2$) and the density of final states ($\\rho_{\\text{bulk}}$).\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. For energies $E$ lying outside the $\\mathbf{k}_{\\parallel}$-resolved bulk continuum, the imaginary part of the surface embedding self-energy vanishes. Any pole of the surface retarded Green’s function at such an $E$ produces a delta-function contribution to $A_{0}(E,\\mathbf{k}_{\\parallel})$ and corresponds to a true surface state with infinite lifetime.**\n- **Analysis:** This statement correctly summarizes our findings for Case 1. Outside the bulk continuum, the density of final (bulk) states is zero, so the decay channel is closed. This makes the imaginary part of the self-energy zero. A pole on the real energy axis results, leading to a delta-function peak in the LDOS, which signifies a stable eigenstate (infinite lifetime).\n- **Verdict:** Correct.\n\n**B. For energies $E$ lying inside the $\\mathbf{k}_{\\parallel}$-resolved bulk continuum, $A_{0}(E,\\mathbf{k}_{\\parallel})$ can still contain delta-function peaks of zero linewidth corresponding to true surface states, even when $t_{s}\\neq 0$ and no additional symmetry constraints exist.**\n- **Analysis:** This proposes the existence of a \"bound state in the continuum\" (BIC) without any protecting symmetry. If $E$ is inside the bulk continuum and the coupling $t_s \\neq 0$, the surface level will hybridize with the degenerate bulk states. As derived in Case 2, this hybridization leads to a non-zero imaginary part of the self-energy and a finite lifetime broadening ($\\Gamma \\neq 0$). A delta-function peak (zero linewidth) is impossible under these conditions. BICs require special circumstances, such as the destructive interference of multiple decay paths or a symmetry mismatch that makes the effective coupling vanish, which the problem explicitly excludes.\n- **Verdict:** Incorrect.\n\n**C. For a surface resonance at energy $E$ inside the $\\mathbf{k}_{\\parallel}$-resolved bulk continuum, the linewidth $\\Gamma(E,\\mathbf{k}_{\\parallel})$ scales with the projected bulk density of states $\\rho_{\\mathrm{bulk}}(E,\\mathbf{k}_{\\parallel})$ and the coupling $t_{s}$ as $\\Gamma\\propto |t_{s}|^{2}\\,\\rho_{\\mathrm{bulk}}(E,\\mathbf{k}_{\\parallel})$ (up to matrix-element factors), so it tends to be larger where $\\rho_{\\mathrm{bulk}}$ is large.**\n- **Analysis:** This statement perfectly matches the result derived from the self-energy expression and Fermi's Golden Rule: $\\Gamma = 2\\pi |t_s|^2 \\rho_{\\text{bulk}}(E, \\mathbf{k}_{\\parallel})$. The linewidth, which represents the decay rate, is directly proportional to the density of available final states ($\\rho_{\\text{bulk}}$) and the square of the coupling term ($|t_s|^2$).\n- **Verdict:** Correct.\n\n**D. In the simple-cubic nearest-neighbor model with $t>0$, the $\\mathbf{k}_{\\parallel}=\\mathbf{0}$ projected bulk continuum spans $E\\in[-6t,-2t]$. Therefore, if the surface potential $V_{s}$ tunes a surface-localized level to $E=-t$, it is a true surface state at $\\mathbf{k}_{\\parallel}=\\mathbf{0}$, whereas at $\\mathbf{k}_{\\parallel}$ satisfying $\\cos(k_{x}a)+\\cos(k_{y}a)=0$ the same level appears as a surface resonance.**\n- **Analysis:** We must verify the energy ranges. The projected bulk continuum for a fixed $\\mathbf{k}_{\\parallel}$ is given by $E(k_z) = -2t[\\cos(k_x a)+\\cos(k_y a)] - 2t \\cos(k_z a)$.\n- At $\\mathbf{k}_{\\parallel}=\\mathbf{0}$ ($k_x=k_y=0$), $\\cos(k_x a)+\\cos(k_y a) = 1+1=2$. The energy band is $E(k_z) = -4t - 2t \\cos(k_z a)$. As $k_z$ varies, $\\cos(k_z a)$ spans $[-1, 1]$, so the energy continuum spans $[-4t - 2t, -4t + 2t] = [-6t, -2t]$. An energy level at $E=-t$ lies above this range, so it is indeed a true surface state.\n- At a $\\mathbf{k}_{\\parallel}$ where $\\cos(k_x a)+\\cos(k_y a)=0$, the energy band is $E(k_z) = 0 - 2t \\cos(k_z a)$. This continuum spans $[-2t, 2t]$. An energy level at $E=-t$ lies inside this continuum. Therefore, at this $\\mathbf{k}_{\\parallel}$, the state would couple to the bulk and become a surface resonance. The statement is entirely correct.\n- **Verdict:** Correct.\n\n**E. True surface states necessarily have zero group velocity along the surface because their wave functions are localized in the direction normal to the surface.**\n- **Analysis:** This is a misunderstanding of electron dynamics. A true surface state has a well-defined crystal momentum $\\mathbf{k}_{\\parallel}$ and an energy $E_s(\\mathbf{k}_{\\parallel})$ that depends on it, forming a surface band structure. The group velocity for propagation *along the surface* is $\\mathbf{v}_{g, \\parallel} = (1/\\hbar)\\nabla_{\\mathbf{k}_{\\parallel}} E_s(\\mathbf{k}_{\\parallel})$. This is generally non-zero, allowing the electron to propagate parallel to the surface. The localization is in the direction *normal* to the surface ($z$-direction), meaning the group velocity component $v_{g,z}$ is zero. The statement falsely claims $v_{g, \\parallel}$ must be zero.\n- **Verdict:** Incorrect.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{ACD}$$", "id": "2765560"}]}
