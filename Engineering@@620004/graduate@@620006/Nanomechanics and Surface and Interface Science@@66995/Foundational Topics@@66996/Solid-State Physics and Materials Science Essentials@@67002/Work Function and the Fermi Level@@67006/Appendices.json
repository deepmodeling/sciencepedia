This problem is valid and well-posed, grounded in the fundamental principles of solid-state physics and surface science.\n\nFirst, we must be precise about the definitions. The problem statement establishes the energy scale by defining the vacuum level, $E_{\\text{vac}}$, as the zero reference point. The vacuum level represents the energy of a stationary electron located just outside the influence of the surface, in the vacuum.\n$$E_{\\mathrm{vac}} \\equiv 0\\,\\text{eV}$$\nThe Fermi level, $E_F$, is the total chemical potential for electrons inside the solid. At absolute zero temperature, $T=0\\,\\text{K}$, it is the energy of the highest occupied quantum state. The problem gives its value on the absolute energy scale as:\n$$E_{F} = -5.3\\,\\text{eV}$$\n\nThe work function, denoted by the Greek letter Phi, $\\phi$, is defined as the minimum thermodynamic work (or energy) required to remove an electron from a solid to a point in the vacuum immediately outside the solid surface. The \"minimum\" energy corresponds to removing an electron from the highest occupied energy level, which is the Fermi level, $E_F$. Therefore, the work function is precisely the energy difference between the vacuum level and the Fermi level.\nMathematically, this relationship is expressed as:\n$$\\phi = E_{\\mathrm{vac}} - E_{F}$$\nSubstituting the given values into this fundamental equation:\n$$\\phi = (0\\,\\text{eV}) - (-5.3\\,\\text{eV})$$\n$$\\phi = 5.3\\,\\text{eV}$$\n\nThe second part of the query requires an explanation for the negative value of the Fermi energy on this scale. The choice of the zero-energy reference is a convention. By setting the energy of a free, stationary electron in vacuum to zero ($E_{\\mathrm{vac}}=0$), we establish a reference against which all other electron energies are measured.\n\nElectrons inside a solid are bound to the crystal lattice by the collective electrostatic attraction of the atomic nuclei. An electron within the metal resides in a potential energy well. To remove it from the metal and make it a free electron in the vacuum, energy must be supplied to overcome this binding. Consequently, any electron in a bound state within the solid must have an energy that is lower than the energy of a free electron in vacuum.\n\nSince the vacuum level is our zero reference, any energy level corresponding to a bound state must be negative. The Fermi level, $E_F$, represents the highest occupied energy state for electrons that are still bound within the material. Therefore, its energy must be less than the vacuum energy, meaning $E_F < E_{\\mathrm{vac}}$.

We must begin from first principles of electrostatics and the definition of the work function.\n\nFirst, we model the chemisorbed monolayer as an infinitely thin sheet of dipoles. Such a dipole sheet, with a uniform surface dipole density $p$ oriented normal to the surface, can be represented as two parallel infinite sheets of charge. One sheet has a surface charge density of $+\\sigma$ and the other $-\\sigma$, separated by a distance $d$. The surface dipole density is then defined as the product $p = \\sigma d$. The problem specifies that the dipole vectors are oriented from the solid into the vacuum, which corresponds to the negative charge sheet $(-\\sigma)$ being on the solid side and the positive charge sheet $(+\\sigma)$ on the vacuum side.\n\nLet the $z$-axis be normal to the surface, with $z < 0$ representing the solid and $z > 0$ the vacuum. The electric field produced by a single infinite sheet of charge with density $\\sigma$ is given by Gauss’s law as $E = \\frac{|\\sigma|}{2\\varepsilon_0}$, directed away from a positive sheet and towards a negative sheet. By the principle of superposition, the electric field between our two sheets (for $0 < z < d$) is the sum of the fields from each sheet. Both fields point from the positive sheet towards the negative sheet (i.e., in the $-z$ direction), so their magnitudes add:\n$$E = \\frac{\\sigma}{2\\varepsilon_0} + \\frac{\\sigma}{2\\varepsilon_0} = \\frac{\\sigma}{\\varepsilon_0}$$\nThe electric field vector inside the layer is thus $\\mathbf{E} = -\\frac{\\sigma}{\\varepsilon_0} \\hat{\\mathbf{z}}$. Outside the dipole layer (for $z < 0$ and $z > d$), the fields from the two oppositely charged sheets cancel, resulting in a zero electric field from the dipole layer itself.\n\nThe change in electrostatic potential, $\\Delta V$, across this dipole layer is found by integrating the electric field, $\\mathbf{E} = -\\nabla V$. The potential difference between the vacuum side (at $z=d$) and the solid side (at $z=0$) is:\n$$\\Delta V = V(d) - V(0) = -\\int_{0}^{d} \\mathbf{E} \\cdot d\\mathbf{l} = -\\int_{0}^{d} \\left(-\\frac{\\sigma}{\\varepsilon_0}\\right) dz = \\frac{\\sigma d}{\\varepsilon_0}$$\nSubstituting the definition of the surface dipole density, $p = \\sigma d$, we find the potential step across the layer:\n$$\\Delta V = \\frac{p}{\\varepsilon_0}$$\nThis positive value indicates that the electrostatic potential in the vacuum is raised relative to the potential in the solid due to this dipole layer.\n\nThe work function, $\\phi$, is defined as the minimum energy required to remove an electron from the solid to a point in the vacuum immediately outside the surface. It is the difference between the vacuum energy level, $E_{\\mathrm{vac}}$, and the Fermi level, $E_F$:\n$$\\phi \\equiv E_{\\mathrm{vac}} - E_F$$\nThe vacuum level $E_{\\mathrm{vac}}$ is the potential energy of a stationary electron (with charge $-e$) in the vacuum just outside the surface. If the electrostatic potential in this region is $V_{\\text{vac}}$, then the potential energy is $E_{\\mathrm{vac}} = -e V_{\\text{vac}}$. The problem states we are to neglect any change in the Fermi level, $E_F$, meaning $\\Delta E_F = 0$. Therefore, the change in the work function is solely due to the change in the vacuum energy level:\n$$\\Delta \\phi = \\Delta E_{\\mathrm{vac}} - \\Delta E_F = \\Delta E_{\\mathrm{vac}}$$\nThe dipole layer shifts the electrostatic potential in the vacuum by $\\Delta V_{\\text{vac}} = \\Delta V = p/\\varepsilon_0$. The corresponding change in the electron's potential energy is:\n$$\\Delta E_{\\mathrm{vac}} = -e \\Delta V_{\\text{vac}} = -e \\frac{p}{\\varepsilon_0}$$\nThus, the change in the work function in units of energy (Joules) is:\n$$\\Delta \\phi = -e \\frac{p}{\\varepsilon_0}$$\nThe physical interpretation of this result is that the positively charged outer face of the dipole layer attracts the escaping electron, thereby lowering the energy barrier for emission and decreasing the work function.

It describes a standard Ultraviolet Photoelectron Spectroscopy (UPS) experiment for determining the work function of a material. We proceed with the derivation based on the fundamental principles of energy conservation in the photoemission process.\n\nLet us define the relevant energy levels. We consider an absolute energy scale. The Fermi levels of the sample and the analyzer are denoted by $E_{F,s}$ and $E_{F,A}$ respectively. The corresponding vacuum levels are $E_{\\mathrm{vac},s}$ and $E_{\\mathrm{vac},A}$. The work functions are defined as the energy difference between the vacuum level and the Fermi level:\n$ \\phi_s = E_{\\mathrm{vac},s} - E_{F,s} $\n$ \\phi_A = E_{\\mathrm{vac},A} - E_{F,A} $\nThe sample is electrically connected to the analyzer and a bias voltage $V_{bias}$ is applied to the sample. Let the analyzer be at ground potential ($V_A=0$). The sample is at potential $V_{bias}$, which is stated to be negative ($V_{bias} < 0$). The potential energy of an electron (charge $-e$) in the sample is therefore shifted by $-eV_{bias}$ relative to an electron at the analyzer. Consequently, all electronic energy levels of the sample are shifted upward by this amount relative to the analyzer's levels. The relationship between the Fermi levels is:\n$$ E_{F,s} = E_{F,A} - eV_{bias} $$\nSince $V_{bias} < 0$, we have $E_{F,s} > E_{F,A}$.\n\nThe kinetic energy of a photoelectron, $E_{K,A}$, is measured by the analyzer. This energy is determined with respect to the analyzer's vacuum level, $E_{\\mathrm{vac},A}$. The total energy, $E_{total}$, of a photoelectron is conserved as it travels from the sample surface into the analyzer.\n$$ E_{total} = E_{initial} + h\\nu = E_{K,A} + E_{\\mathrm{vac},A} $$\nwhere $E_{initial}$ is the initial energy of the electron in the solid before photoexcitation and $h\\nu$ is the incident photon energy.\n\nWe now derive the measured kinetic energy for the two key features of the spectrum: the Fermi edge and the low-kinetic-energy cutoff.\n\n1.  The Fermi Edge: This feature corresponds to the photoelectrons with the highest kinetic energy. These electrons originate from the sample's Fermi level, so their initial energy is $E_{initial} = E_{F,s}$. The kinetic energy of these electrons as measured by the analyzer, denoted $E_{K,A}(\\text{FE})$, is found by rearranging the energy conservation equation:\n    $$ E_{K,A}(\\text{FE}) = (E_{initial} + h\\nu) - E_{\\mathrm{vac},A} = (E_{F,s} + h\\nu) - E_{\\mathrm{vac},A} $$\n    Substituting the expressions for $E_{F,s}$ and $E_{\\mathrm{vac},A}$:\n    $$ E_{K,A}(\\text{FE}) = (E_{F,A} - eV_{bias} + h\\nu) - (E_{F,A} + \\phi_A) $$\n    $$ E_{K,A}(\\text{FE}) = h\\nu - \\phi_A - eV_{bias} $$\n\n2.  The Low-Kinetic-Energy Cutoff: This feature, also known as the secondary electron cutoff, corresponds to electrons that have just enough energy to escape the sample into vacuum. These electrons have negligible kinetic energy at the sample surface ($E_{K,s} \\approx 0$). Their total energy is therefore equal to the sample's vacuum level, $E_{total} = E_{\\mathrm{vac},s}$. Upon reaching the analyzer, their measured kinetic energy, $E_{K,A}(\\text{cutoff})$, is given by:\n    $$ E_{K,A}(\\text{cutoff}) = E_{total} - E_{\\mathrm{vac},A} = E_{\\mathrm{vac},s} - E_{\\mathrm{vac},A} $$\n    Substituting the expressions for $E_{\\mathrm{vac},s}$ and $E_{\\mathrm{vac},A}$:\n    $$ E_{\\mathrm{vac},s} = E_{F,s} + \\phi_s = (E_{F,A} - eV_{bias}) + \\phi_s $$\n    $$ E_{K,A}(\\text{cutoff}) = ((E_{F,A} - eV_{bias}) + \\phi_s) - (E_{F,A} + \\phi_A) $$\n    $$ E_{K,A}(\\text{cutoff}) = \\phi_s - \\phi_A - eV_{bias} $$\n\nThe problem provides the measured energy separation between the Fermi edge and the low-kinetic-energy cutoff. Let us call this spectral width $W$. It is the difference between the kinetic energies of these two features:\n$$ W = E_{K,A}(\\text{FE}) - E_{K,A}(\\text{cutoff}) $$\nSubstituting the derived expressions for these energies:\n$$ W = (h\\nu - \\phi_A - eV_{bias}) - (\\phi_s - \\phi_A - eV_{bias}) $$\nThe terms related to the analyzer work function, $\\phi_A$, and the applied bias, $V_{bias}$, cancel out, as they cause a rigid shift of the entire energy spectrum.\n$$ W = h\\nu - \\phi_s $$\nThis is the required relationship connecting the photon energy $h\\nu$, the measured spectral width $W$, and the sample work function $\\phi_s$.\n\nTo compute the numerical value of the sample work function $\\phi_s$, we rearrange the equation:\n$$ \\phi_s = h\\nu - W $$\nThe problem provides the following values:\nPhoton energy: $h\\nu = 21.22\\,\\text{eV}$.\nMeasured separation (spectral width): $W = 16.0\\,\\text{eV}$.\n\nSubstituting these values into the equation:\n$$ \\phi_s = 21.22\\,\\text{eV} - 16.0\\,\\text{eV} $$\n$$ \\phi_s = 5.22\\,\\text{eV} $$\nThe problem requires the final answer to be rounded to three significant figures.
