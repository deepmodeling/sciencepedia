All provided parameters and constants are physically realistic and consistent with the stated assumptions, such as the nonretarded and high-temperature regimes. The problem is therefore deemed valid. We proceed with the derivation of the interaction energies.\n\nThe total van der Waals interaction potential $W(R)$ between two identical polar molecules is the sum of three contributions: the Keesom interaction ($W_{\\text{Keesom}}$), the Debye interaction ($W_{\\text{Debye}}$), and the London dispersion interaction ($W_{\\text{London}}$). We will derive each of these terms based on the fundamental principles specified.\n\n**1. Keesom (Permanent-Permanent) Interaction**\nThe Keesom interaction is the orientation-averaged free energy of interaction between two permanent dipoles. The electrostatic potential energy of two dipoles $\\mathbf{p}_1$ and $\\mathbf{p}_2$ separated by a vector $\\mathbf{R}$ is given by\n$$ V_{\\mathrm{dd}}(\\mathbf{R},\\mathbf{p}_{1},\\mathbf{p}_{2}) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\left[ \\frac{\\mathbf{p}_1 \\cdot \\mathbf{p}_2}{R^3} - \\frac{3(\\mathbf{p}_1 \\cdot \\mathbf{R})(\\mathbf{p}_2 \\cdot \\mathbf{R})}{R^5} \\right] $$\nwhere $|\\mathbf{p}_1|=|\\mathbf{p}_2|=\\mu$. In the canonical ensemble, the interaction free energy is $W(R) = -k_{B}T \\ln \\langle \\exp(-V_{\\mathrm{dd}}/(k_{B}T)) \\rangle_{\\Omega}$, where $\\langle \\dots \\rangle_{\\Omega}$ denotes the unweighted average over all orientations of both dipoles. The problem specifies the high-temperature approximation, where $|V_{\\mathrm{dd}}| \\ll k_{B}T$. We expand the exponential and the logarithm:\n$$ \\exp\\left(-\\frac{V_{\\mathrm{dd}}}{k_{B}T}\\right) \\approx 1 - \\frac{V_{\\mathrm{dd}}}{k_{B}T} + \\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\frac{V_{\\mathrm{dd}}}{k_{B}T}\\right)^2 - \\dots $$\n$$ \\ln(1+x) \\approx x - \\frac{x^2}{2} + \\dots $$\nThe average of the first-order term is zero, $\\langle V_{\\mathrm{dd}} \\rangle_{\\Omega} = 0$, due to the random orientation of the dipoles. The leading non-zero contribution to the free energy is thus:\n$$ W_{\\text{Keesom}}(R) \\approx -k_{B}T \\ln\\left(1 + \\frac{\\langle V_{\\mathrm{dd}}^2 \\rangle_{\\Omega}}{2(k_{B}T)^2}\\right) \\approx -k_{B}T \\left(\\frac{\\langle V_{\\mathrm{dd}}^2 \\rangle_{\\Omega}}{2(k_{B}T)^2}\\right) = -\\frac{\\langle V_{\\mathrm{dd}}^2 \\rangle_{\\Omega}}{2k_{B}T} $$\nWe must now compute the orientational average of $V_{\\mathrm{dd}}^2$. By choosing a coordinate system where $\\mathbf{R}$ is along the $z$-axis, it can be demonstrated through direct integration over the spherical coordinates of the two dipoles that $\\langle (\\sin\\theta_1 \\sin\\theta_2 \\cos(\\phi_1-\\phi_2) - 2\\cos\\theta_1 \\cos\\theta_2)^2 \\rangle = 2/3$. This yields:\n$$ \\langle V_{\\mathrm{dd}}^2 \\rangle_{\\Omega} = \\left(\\frac{\\mu^2}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0 R^3}\\right)^2 \\left\\langle \\left( \\sin\\theta_1 \\sin\\theta_2 \\cos(\\phi_1-\\phi_2) - 2\\cos\\theta_1\\cos\\theta_2 \\right)^2 \\right\\rangle_{\\Omega} = \\frac{2}{3}\\left(\\frac{\\mu^2}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0 R^3}\\right)^2 $$\nSubstituting this into the expression for the free energy, we obtain the Keesom interaction energy:\n$$ W_{\\text{Keesom}}(R) = -\\frac{1}{2k_{B}T} \\cdot \\frac{2}{3}\\left(\\frac{\\mu^2}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0 R^3}\\right)^2 = -\\frac{2}{3} \\frac{\\mu^4}{(4\\pi\\epsilon_0)^2 k_{B}T R^6} $$\n\n**2. Debye (Permanent-Induced) Interaction**\nThe Debye interaction arises from a permanent dipole on one molecule inducing a dipole in the other. A molecule with a permanent dipole $\\mathbf{p}_1$ generates an electric field $\\mathbf{E}_1$ at the location of the second molecule, a distance $R$ away:\n$$ \\mathbf{E}_1(\\mathbf{R}) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\left( \\frac{3(\\mathbf{p}_1\\cdot\\mathbf{R})\\mathbf{R}}{R^5} - \\frac{\\mathbf{p}_1}{R^3} \\right) $$\nThis field induces a dipole moment $\\mathbf{p}_{2,\\text{ind}} = \\alpha(0)\\mathbf{E}_1$ in the second molecule, which has isotropic static polarizability $\\alpha(0)$. The energy of this induced dipole in the field $\\mathbf{E}_1$ is $U_{1 \\to 2} = -\\frac{1}{2}\\alpha(0)E_1^2$. The magnitude squared of the field is:\n$$ E_1^2 = \\mathbf{E}_1 \\cdot \\mathbf{E}_1 = \\left(\\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0}\\right)^2 \\frac{1}{R^6}(3(\\mathbf{p}_1\\cdot\\hat{\\mathbf{R}})^2 + \\mathbf{p}_1^2) = \\left(\\frac{\\mu}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0 R^3}\\right)^2 (3\\cos^2\\theta_1 + 1) $$\nwhere $\\theta_1$ is the angle between $\\mathbf{p}_1$ and $\\mathbf{R}$. To find the interaction energy, we must average this over all orientations of $\\mathbf{p}_1$. Using $\\langle \\cos^2\\theta_1 \\rangle = 1/3$:\n$$ \\langle E_1^2 \\rangle_{\\Omega_1} = \\left(\\frac{\\mu}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0 R^3}\\right)^2 (3\\langle\\cos^2\\theta_1\\rangle + 1) = 2\\left(\\frac{\\mu}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0 R^3}\\right)^2 $$\nThe orientation-averaged interaction energy from molecule $1$ inducing a dipole in molecule $2$ is $\\langle U_{1 \\to 2} \\rangle = -\\frac{1}{2}\\alpha(0)\\langle E_1^2 \\rangle_{\\Omega_1} = -\\alpha(0)\\left(\\frac{\\mu}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0 R^3}\\right)^2$.\nSince the molecules are identical, molecule $2$ also induces a dipole in molecule $1$ with an identical interaction energy contribution, $\\langle U_{2 \\to 1} \\rangle = \\langle U_{1 \\to 2} \\rangle$. The total Debye interaction is their sum:\n$$ W_{\\text{Debye}}(R) = \\langle U_{1 \\to 2} \\rangle + \\langle U_{2 \\to 1} \\rangle = -2\\alpha(0)\\left(\\frac{\\mu}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0 R^3}\\right)^2 = -\\frac{2\\alpha(0)\\mu^2}{(4\\pi\\epsilon_0)^2 R^6} $$\n\n**3. London Dispersion Interaction**\nThe London dispersion force arises from quantum mechanical fluctuations of electron density, creating transient dipoles. We use second-order perturbation theory. The perturbation is the dipole-dipole interaction operator $\\hat{V}_{\\mathrm{dd}}$. The ground-state energy correction is\n$$ W_{\\text{London}}(R) = \\sum_{n \\neq 0} \\frac{|\\langle 0 | \\hat{V}_{\\mathrm{dd}} | n \\rangle|^2}{E_0 - E_n} $$\nA powerful tool for this calculation is the Casimir-Polder formula, which expresses the interaction energy in terms of the dynamic polarizability at imaginary frequencies, $\\alpha(i\\nu)$:\n$$ W_{\\text{London}}(R) = -\\frac{\\hbar}{2\\pi} \\int_0^\\infty d\\nu \\, \\text{Tr}[\\mathbf{T} \\cdot \\boldsymbol{\\alpha}_1(i\\nu) \\cdot \\mathbf{T} \\cdot \\boldsymbol{\\alpha}_2(i\\nu)] $$\nwhere $\\mathbf{T} = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0 R^3}(\\mathbf{I} - 3\\hat{\\mathbf{R}}\\otimes\\hat{\\mathbf{R}})$ is the dipole-dipole interaction tensor. For isotropic molecules, $\\boldsymbol{\\alpha}(i\\nu) = \\alpha(i\\nu)\\mathbf{I}$, and the trace evaluates to $\\text{Tr}(\\mathbf{T}^2) = 6/((4\\pi\\epsilon_0)^2 R^6)$. The interaction is:\n$$ W_{\\text{London}}(R) = -\\frac{3\\hbar}{\\pi (4\\pi\\epsilon_0)^2 R^6} \\int_0^\\infty [\\alpha(i\\nu)]^2 d\\nu $$\nThe molecules are modeled as single-resonance oscillators, so their dynamic polarizability is $\\alpha(\\omega) = \\frac{\\alpha(0)\\omega_0^2}{\\omega_0^2 - \\omega^2}$. At imaginary frequencies $\\omega = i\\nu$:\n$$ \\alpha(i\\nu) = \\frac{\\alpha(0)\\omega_0^2}{\\omega_0^2 - (i\\nu)^2} = \\frac{\\alpha(0)\\omega_0^2}{\\omega_0^2 + \\nu^2} $$\nWe evaluate the integral:\n$$ \\int_0^\\infty [\\alpha(i\\nu)]^2 d\\nu = [\\alpha(0)\\omega_0^2]^2 \\int_0^\\infty \\frac{d\\nu}{(\\omega_0^2+\\nu^2)^2} = [\\alpha(0)\\omega_0^2]^2 \\left( \\frac{\\pi}{4\\omega_0^3} \\right) = \\frac{\\pi}{4}\\alpha(0)^2 \\omega_0 $$\nSubstituting this into the energy expression gives the London interaction:\n$$ W_{\\text{London}}(R) = -\\frac{3\\hbar}{\\pi (4\\pi\\epsilon_0)^2 R^6} \\left( \\frac{\\pi}{4}\\alpha(0)^2 \\omega_0 \\right) = -\\frac{3}{4} \\frac{\\hbar\\omega_0\\alpha(0)^2}{(4\\pi\\epsilon_0)^2 R^6} $$\n\n**Numerical Evaluation**\nWe are given:\n$R=1.00 \\times 10^{-9}\\ \\mathrm{m}$\n$T=300\\ \\mathrm{K}$\n$\\mu=2.00\\ \\mathrm{D} = 2.00 \\times (3.33564 \\times 10^{-30}\\ \\mathrm{C\\,m}) = 6.67128 \\times 10^{-30}\\ \\mathrm{C\\,m}$\n$\\alpha(0)=1.00 \\times 10^{-39}\\ \\mathrm{C\\,m^{2}/V}$\n$\\omega_{0}=2.00 \\times 10^{16}\\ \\mathrm{s^{-1}}$\nAnd constants: $\\epsilon_{0}$, $k_{B}$, $\\hbar$.\nLet's evaluate the three energy contributions.\n\n$|W_{\\text{Keesom}}| = \\frac{2}{3} \\frac{\\mu^4}{(4\\pi\\epsilon_0)^2 k_{B}T R^6} = \\frac{2}{3} \\frac{(6.67128 \\times 10^{-30})^4}{(4\\pi\\epsilon_0)^2 (1.380649 \\times 10^{-23} \\times 300) (10^{-9})^6} \\approx 2.576 \\times 10^{-23}\\ \\mathrm{J}$\n\n$|W_{\\text{Debye}}| = \\frac{2\\alpha(0)\\mu^2}{(4\\pi\\epsilon_0)^2 R^6} = \\frac{2(1.00 \\times 10^{-39})(6.67128 \\times 10^{-30})^2}{(4\\pi\\epsilon_0)^2 (10^{-9})^6} \\approx 7.190 \\times 10^{-24}\\ \\mathrm{J}$\n\n$|W_{\\text{London}}| = \\frac{3}{4} \\frac{\\hbar\\omega_0\\alpha(0)^2}{(4\\pi\\epsilon_0)^2 R^6} = \\frac{3}{4} \\frac{(1.05457 \\times 10^{-34} \\times 2.00 \\times 10^{16})(1.00 \\times 10^{-39})^2}{(4\\pi\\epsilon_0)^2 (10^{-9})^6} \\approx 1.278 \\times 10^{-22}\\ \\mathrm{J}$\n\nComparing the magnitudes:\n$|W_{\\text{London}}| \\approx 1.278 \\times 10^{-22}\\ \\mathrm{J}$\n$|W_{\\text{Keesom}}| \\approx 0.2576 \\times 10^{-22}\\ \\mathrm{J}$\n$|W_{\\text{Debye}}| \\approx 0.0719 \\times 10^{-22}\\ \\mathrm{J}$\n\nThe London dispersion interaction has the largest magnitude for the given parameters.

By analyzing various geometries, you will learn to identify scenarios where the PFA breaks down and more sophisticated, numerically exact methods are required.", "problem": "Casimir forces between bodies arise from quantum electromagnetic fluctuations constrained by boundary conditions at material interfaces. A frequently used approximation is the Proximity Force Approximation (PFA), which replaces the interaction by a local integration of the plane–plane result over the nearest separations. From first principles, PFA tacitly assumes local additivity of stress and a separation of scales: the lateral variation scale of the gap and surface slopes must be gentle compared to the correlation length of the fluctuating fields, which for separations of order $a$ is set by lateral wave vectors $k_{\\parallel}$ of order $1/a$. When this separation of scales is lost (e.g., sharp edges, deep trenches, or rapid modulations), nonlocal multiple scattering of modes invalidates PFA, and one must use methods that resolve the full boundary-value problem, such as scattering theory for periodic structures or numerical boundary-element methods for arbitrary sharp geometries.\n\nConsider the following four vacuum-gap geometries at room temperature, with nonmagnetic, good-conductor coatings so that material dispersion does not dominate the geometry-driven validity of approximations.

The relevant lateral correlation length of the fluctuating fields is of order $a$. Thus, for PFA to be valid, the characteristic lateral dimension of the surface features, $L_{\\text{lateral}}$, must be much larger than the separation $a$, i.e., $L_{\\text{lateral}} \\gg a$.\n- **PFA failure**: PFA fails when the separation of scales is lost ($L_{\\text{lateral}} \\lesssim a$) or when surfaces have sharp edges or large aspect ratios, leading to nonlocal multiple scattering.\n- **Alternative methods**: Scattering theory for periodic structures; numerical boundary-element methods (BEM) for sharp, arbitrary geometries.\n- **General conditions**: All geometries are in a vacuum gap at room temperature, with nonmagnetic, good-conductor coatings.\n- **Case A**: Sphere-plate geometry with sphere radius $R = 100\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}$ and closest separation $a = 100\\,\\mathrm{nm}$. Recommended method: PFA.\n- **Case B**: Sinusoidally corrugated plate facing a flat plate, with amplitude $A = 10\\,\\mathrm{nm}$, wavelength $\\lambda = 200\\,\\mathrm{nm}$, and mean separation $a = 500\\,\\mathrm{nm}$. Recommended method: Scattering-matrix approach.\n- **Case C**: Rectangular grating facing a flat plate, with period $p = 400\\,\\mathrm{nm}$, trench width $w = 200\\,\\mathrm{nm}$, depth $d = 1\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}$, and closest separation $a = 100\\,\\mathrm{nm}$. The grating has sharp edges. Recommended method: BEM.\n- **Case D**: Two plates with Gaussian roughness characterized by root-mean-square height $\\delta = 0.5\\,\\mathrm{nm}$ and correlation length $\\xi = 500\\,\\mathrm{nm}$, at a mean separation $a = 50\\,\\mathrm{nm}$. Recommended method: PFA for roughness or perturbation theory.\n\n**Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens**\nThe problem is scientifically grounded, providing a correct and standard description of the Proximity Force Approximation and its domain of validity in the context of Casimir forces. The provided geometries and parameters are physically realistic and typical for experiments and theoretical studies in this field. The problem is well-posed, objective, and self-contained, requiring the application of a clearly articulated principle (separation of scales) to specific cases. No scientific flaws, contradictions, or ambiguities are present.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem statement is valid. A full analysis will be performed.\n\n**Solution Derivation**\nThe task is to identify the cases where PFA is expected to fail and the recommended alternative method is appropriate. The primary criterion for PFA failure is the violation of the scale separation condition, $L_{\\text{lateral}} \\gg a$.\n\n**Analysis of Option A**\n- **Geometry**: Sphere of radius $R = 100\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}$ above a plate at separation $a = 100\\,\\mathrm{nm}$.\n- **PFA Validity**: The interaction is dominated by the region where the lateral distance from the point of closest approach, $\\rho$, is such that the local gap, $h(\\rho) \\approx a + \\rho^2/(2R)$, is comparable to $a$. The characteristic lateral length scale is therefore $L_{\\text{lateral}} \\approx \\sqrt{2aR}$.\n- **Calculation**: $L_{\\text{lateral}} \\approx \\sqrt{2 \\times (100\\,\\mathrm{nm}) \\times (100 \\times 10^3\\,\\mathrm{nm})} = \\sqrt{2 \\times 10^7}\\,\\mathrm{nm^2} \\approx 4472\\,\\mathrm{nm}$.\n- **Assessment**: We compare $L_{\\text{lateral}}$ to $a$. Here, $4472\\,\\mathrm{nm} \\gg 100\\,\\mathrm{nm}$. The scale separation condition is well satisfied. The surface is defined as smooth, so there are no sharp features.\n- **Conclusion**: PFA is expected to be an excellent approximation for this geometry. Therefore, PFA does not fail. The option recommends using PFA, which is correct, but the question asks to identify cases where PFA *fails*.\n- **Verdict on Option A**: Incorrect.\n\n**Analysis of Option B**\n- **Geometry**: Sinusoidally corrugated plate ($\\lambda = 200\\,\\mathrm{nm}$, $A = 10\\,\\mathrm{nm}$) facing a flat plate at mean separation $a = 500\\,\\mathrm{nm}$.\n- **PFA Validity**: The characteristic lateral scale of the surface modulation is the wavelength, $L_{\\text{lateral}} = \\lambda = 200\\,\\mathrm{nm}$. The separation is $a = 500\\,\\mathrm{nm}$.\n- **Assessment**: We compare $L_{\\text{lateral}}$ to $a$. Here, $\\lambda = 200\\,\\mathrm{nm}$ and $a = 500\\,\\mathrm{nm}$. We have $\\lambda  a$. The condition $L_{\\text{lateral}} \\gg a$ is strongly violated. The lateral variation of the surface is faster than the scale set by the separation. This is a classic regime where diffractive effects, which are ignored by PFA, become dominant.\n- **Conclusion**: PFA is expected to fail.\n- **Appropriateness of Method**: The recommended method is a scattering-matrix approach. For periodic structures like gratings, scattering-matrix (or Fourier modal) methods are the rigorous and standard approach. They solve the full electromagnetic boundary-value problem by decomposing the fields into a basis of diffracted orders (plane waves), thereby correctly accounting for all diffraction and multiple scattering effects. The method is entirely appropriate for this case where PFA fails.\n- **Verdict on Option B**: Correct.\n\n**Analysis of Option C**\n- **Geometry**: Rectangular grating (period $p = 400\\,\\mathrm{nm}$, depth $d = 1\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}$) with \"sharp vertical sidewalls and edges\", at closest separation $a = 100\\,\\mathrm{nm}$.\n- **PFA Validity**: The problem explicitly states there are \"sharp...edges\". A sharp edge represents a geometric feature with a lateral scale of variation that is effectively zero. This is the most extreme violation of the PFA requirement that \"surface slopes must be gentle\". Furthermore, the aspect ratio of the trenches is large: the depth $d = 1000\\,\\mathrm{nm}$ is much greater than both the separation $a = 100\\,\\mathrm{nm}$ and the lateral feature sizes like trench width $w = 200\\,\\mathrm{nm}$. Such high-aspect-ratio structures lead to strong, nonlocal, multiple-scattering effects inside the trenches, which are completely neglected by the pairwise-additive nature of PFA.\n- **Conclusion**: PFA is expected to fail catastrophically.\n- **Appropriateness of Method**: The recommended method is a numerical boundary-element method (BEM). BEM is a powerful numerical technique for solving boundary-value problems like Maxwell's equations for bodies of arbitrary shape. It is particularly well-suited for geometries with sharp features, for which methods relying on modal expansions can have convergence issues. BEM directly discretizes the surfaces of the interacting bodies, correctly calculating the fields and forces by accounting for all nonlocal geometric effects. It is a highly appropriate \"full-wave\" solver for this complex geometry.\n- **Verdict on Option C**: Correct.\n\n**Analysis of Option D**\n- **Geometry**: Plates with Gaussian roughness ($\\delta = 0.5\\,\\mathrm{nm}$, $\\xi = 500\\,\\mathrm{nm}$) at mean separation $a = 50\\,\\mathrm{nm}$.\n- **PFA Validity**: The characteristic lateral scale of the roughness is the correlation length, $L_{\\text{lateral}} = \\xi = 500\\,\\mathrm{nm}$. The vertical scale of the roughness is $\\delta = 0.5\\,\\mathrm{nm}$. The separation is $a = 50\\,\\mathrm{nm}$.\n- **Assessment**: We compare the length scales. The lateral scale $\\xi = 500\\,\\mathrm{nm}$ is much larger than the separation $a = 50\\,\\mathrm{nm}$ ($\\xi = 10a$). The vertical roughness $\\delta = 0.5\\,\\mathrm{nm}$ is much smaller than the separation $a = 50\\,\\mathrm{nm}$ ($\\delta = 0.01a$). The roughness is therefore very \"gentle\" and \"small\". Both conditions for the validity of approximate methods are met.\n- **Conclusion**: PFA is expected to be a valid approximation. Perturbation theory in the roughness amplitude is also valid in this regime. PFA is not expected to fail.\n- **Appropriateness of Method**: The recommendation is to use PFA or perturbation theory, not full-wave solvers. This is the correct course of action for this geometry. However, the problem asks to identify cases where PFA *fails*. This is a case where it succeeds.\n- **Verdict on Option D**: Incorrect.\n\nIn summary, PFA is expected to fail in cases B and C, and in both cases, the recommended advanced method is appropriate for handling the complexities that invalidate PFA.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{BC}$$", "id": "2796724"}]}
