Therefore, the problem is valid, and we proceed with the solution.\n\nThe problem requires the derivation of the electrostatic force exerted by a uniformly charged ring on a point charge located on its symmetry axis. The derivation will begin from Coulomb's law and the principle of superposition.\n\nLet the ring have radius $a$ and be centered at the origin in the $x$-$y$ plane. The total charge on the ring is $Q$, distributed uniformly, which gives a linear charge density $\\lambda = \\frac{Q}{2\\pi a}$. A point charge $q$ is located at a position $\\vec{r} = (0, 0, z)$, which we can write as $\\vec{r} = z\\hat{k}$.\n\nWe consider a differential element of charge $dQ'$ on the ring. In cylindrical coordinates, the position of this element can be parameterized by the angle $\\phi'$. The position vector of this charge element is $\\vec{r}' = a\\cos\\phi' \\hat{i} + a\\sin\\phi' \\hat{j}$. The differential charge element is $dQ' = \\lambda \\, ds'$, where $ds' = a \\, d\\phi'$ is the differential arc length.

This is the monopole contribution. From a large distance, the ring's structure is unresolved, and it appears as a point charge $Q$ at the origin.\nThe first non-vanishing multipole moment is the monopole moment, which is the total charge $Q$. The dipole moment is zero due to symmetry. The leading correction to the monopole term is a force proportional to $1/z^4$. This term arises from the ring's electric quadrupole moment. Thus, the finite size of the ring first manifests as a quadrupole correction to the point-charge force.\n\nCase 2: Near-field limit ($|z| \\ll a$)\nWe again start with the exact expression and this time factor out $a^2$ from the denominator:\n$$ F_z = \\frac{qQz}{4\\pi\\varepsilon_{0}(a^2(1 + z^2/a^2))^{\\frac{3}{2}}} = \\frac{qQz}{4\\pi\\varepsilon_{0}a^3(1 + z^2/a^2)^{\\frac{3}{2}}} $$\nUsing the binomial expansion with $x = z^2/a^2$ and $n = -3/2$:\n$$ F_z \\approx \\frac{qQz}{4\\pi\\varepsilon_{0}a^3} \\left(1 - \\frac{3}{2}\\frac{z^2}{a^2} + \\dots\\right) = \\frac{qQ}{4\\pi\\varepsilon_{0}a^3}z - \\frac{3qQ}{8\\pi\\varepsilon_{0}a^5}z^3 + \\dots $$\nFor very small displacements $|z|$ near the center of the ring, the force is dominated by the linear term:\n$$ F_z \\approx \\left(\\frac{qQ}{4\\pi\\varepsilon_{0}a^3}\\right) z $$\nThis is a linear restoring force of the form $F_z = Kz$, where $K = \\frac{qQ}{4\\pi\\varepsilon_{0}a^3}$. If the charges $q$ and $Q$ have opposite signs ($qQ  0$), the force is directed towards the origin $z=0$, and the charge $q$ will undergo simple harmonic motion along the $z$-axis for small displacements. The point $z=0$ is a point of stable equilibrium. If $qQ > 0$, it is a point of unstable equilibrium.\nThis linear dependence is expected, as the force $F_z(z)$ is an odd function of $z$ (reversing the sign of $z$ reverses the direction of the force), and its Taylor expansion about $z=0$ must therefore contain only odd powers of $z$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\frac{qQz}{4\\pi\\varepsilon_{0}(a^2 + z^2)^{\\frac{3}{2}}}}\n$$", "id": "2770906"}, {"introduction": "Many physical systems, from molecules to nanoscale probes, are charge-neutral yet possess a non-uniform charge distribution that gives rise to long-range forces.

The total electric field is the sum of the field from the point charge itself, $\\vec{E}_q$, and the field from the induced charges on the sphere, $\\vec{E}_{ind}$. Thus, $\\vec{E} = \\vec{E}_q + \\vec{E}_{ind}$.\nSubstituting this into the MST gives three terms: one involving only $\\vec{E}_q$, one involving only $\\vec{E}_{ind}$, and a cross-term.\n$1$. The self-force term, from integrating the stress tensor constructed from $\\vec{E}_q$ alone, i.e. $\\oint \\mathbf{T}(\\vec{E}_q) \\cdot d\\vec{A}$, is zero for a static point charge.\n$2$. The term involving only the induced field, from the stress tensor constructed from $\\vec{E}_{ind}$ alone, i.e. $\\oint \\mathbf{T}(\\vec{E}_{ind}) \\cdot d\\vec{A}$, vanishes as $\\epsilon \\to 0$. This is because $\\vec{E}_{ind}$ is regular (non-singular) at the position of $q$, so the integrand remains finite while the surface area of integration vanishes as $\\epsilon^2$.\n$3$. The only non-vanishing contribution comes from the cross-term:\n$$F_i = \\varepsilon_0 \\oint_{\\mathcal{S}_\\epsilon} (E_{qi}E_{ind,j} + E_{qj}E_{ind,i} - \\delta_{ij} \\vec{E}_q \\cdot \\vec{E}_{ind}) dA_j$$\nSince the integration surface is infinitesimally small, we can treat the regular field $\\vec{E}_{ind}$ as constant over $\\mathcal{S}_\\epsilon$, evaluating it at the position of the charge, $\\vec{E}_{ind}(\\vec{r}_q)$. The expression for the force becomes:\n$$F_i = \\varepsilon_0 \\left( E_{ind,j}(\\vec{r}_q) \\oint_{\\mathcal{S}_\\epsilon} E_{qi} dA_j + E_{ind,i}(\\vec{r}_q) \\oint_{\\mathcal{S}_\\epsilon} E_{qj} dA_j - E_{ind,k}(\\vec{r}_q) \\oint_{\\mathcal{S}_\\epsilon} E_{qk} dA_i \\right)$$\nThe integral $\\oint_{\\mathcal{S}_\\epsilon} E_{q\\alpha} dA_\\beta$ over a sphere centered on $q$ can be shown to be $\\frac{q}{3\\varepsilon_0}\\delta_{\\alpha\\beta}$. Substituting this result:\n$$F_i = \\varepsilon_0 \\left( E_{ind,j}(\\vec{r}_q) \\frac{q}{3\\varepsilon_0}\\delta_{ij} + E_{ind,i}(\\vec{r}_q) \\frac{q}{3\\varepsilon_0}\\delta_{jj} - E_{ind,k}(\\vec{r}_q) \\frac{q}{3\\varepsilon_0}\\delta_{ki} \\right)$$\nUsing the properties of the Kronecker delta, $\\delta_{ij}E_{ind,j} = E_{ind,i}$, $\\delta_{jj}=3$, and $\\delta_{ki}E_{ind,k} = E_{ind,i}$:\n$$F_i = \\frac{q}{3}E_{ind,i}(\\vec{r}_q) + \\frac{q}{3}E_{ind,i}(\\vec{r}_q)(3) - \\frac{q}{3}E_{ind,i}(\\vec{r}_q) = \\frac{q}{3}E_{ind,i}(\\vec{r}_q) + qE_{ind,i}(\\vec{r}_q) - \\frac{q}{3}E_{ind,i}(\\vec{r}_q) = qE_{ind,i}(\\vec{r}_q)$$\nThus, the force on the charge $q$ is $\\vec{F} = q\\vec{E}_{ind}(\\vec{r}_q)$, where $\\vec{E}_{ind}(\\vec{r}_q)$ is the electric field at the position of $q$ due to all other sources (the induced charges).\nAs per the problem instruction and the uniqueness theorem, the field of the induced charges outside the sphere is identical to the field produced by the image charge $q'$ found in Part (1).\n$$\\vec{E}_{ind}(\\vec{r}) = \\vec{E}_{q'}(\\vec{r}) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\varepsilon_0} \\frac{q'(\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}_{q'})}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}_{q'}|^3}$$\nWe evaluate this field at the location of the real charge, $\\vec{r}=\\vec{r}_q=a\\hat{k}$:\n$$\\vec{E}_{ind}(\\vec{r}_q) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\varepsilon_0} \\frac{q'(a\\hat{k} - b\\hat{k})}{|a\\hat{k} - b\\hat{k}|^3} = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\varepsilon_0} \\frac{q'(a-b)\\hat{k}}{(a-b)^3} = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\varepsilon_0} \\frac{q'}{(a-b)^2}\\hat{k}$$\nThe force is then:\n$$\\vec{F} = q\\vec{E}_{ind}(\\vec{r}_q) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\varepsilon_0} \\frac{q q'}{(a-b)^2}\\hat{k}$$\nThe $z$-component $F_z$ is precisely the same expression obtained in Part (1). Subsequent substitution of $q' = -qR/a$ and $b=R^2/a$ naturally yields the same final result:\n$$F_z = -\\frac{1}{4\\pi\\varepsilon_0} \\frac{q^2 R a}{(a^2-R^2)^2}$$\nThe two methods produce an identical result, demonstrating the internal consistency of classical electromagnetic theory. The force on the physical charge $q$ may be conceptualized either as the direct Coulomb force from a fictitious image charge or as the local interaction of the charge $q$ with the physical field $\\vec{E}_{ind}$ produced by the surface charges on the conductor.", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{-\\frac{q^2 R a}{4 \\pi \\varepsilon_0 (a^2 - R^2)^2}} $$", "id": "2770912"}]}
