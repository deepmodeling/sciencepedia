This practice directly challenges that core assumption by guiding you to estimate the number of atoms across the diameter of a nanopillar. This simple estimation reveals the breakdown of scale separation at the nanoscale, forcing a critical re-evaluation of the meaning of a \"smooth\" stress field when the averaging volume is no longer orders of magnitude larger than the atomic spacing [@problem_id:2776931].", "problem": "A crystalline nanopillar fabricated from a face-centered cubic (FCC) metal has a circular cross-section with diameter $D = 20\\,\\text{nm}$ and cubic lattice parameter $a = 0.36\\,\\text{nm}$.

Report as your final answer the estimated number of atoms across the diameter (a pure number). Round your answer to two significant figures.", "solution": "The lattice parameter $a$ in a cubic crystal is defined as the periodic spacing between equivalent lattice points along each Cartesian axis. For a face-centered cubic (FCC) crystal oriented such that the nanopillar axis is parallel to a $\\langle 100 \\rangle$ direction, the spacing between equivalent lattice sites along that direction is $a$. Along a straight line drawn across the circular cross-section and aligned with this $\\langle 100 \\rangle$ direction (i.e., across the diameter), the number of lattice periods that fit across the diameter is given by the ratio of the geometric size to the repeat distance.\n\nLet $N$ denote the number of interatomic spacings (equivalently, the number of lattice periods) across the diameter. A first-principles estimate follows from the definition of periodicity:\n$$\nN \\approx \\frac{D}{a}\n$$\nThis expression is obtained by counting how many intervals of length $a$ fit into a length $D$. There is a subtlety regarding whether one counts spacings or lattice sites: the number of sites along a line segment of length $D$ is approximately $D/a + 1$, whereas the number of spacings is $D/a$. For an estimate at the nanoscale where $D \\gg a$, the difference of $1$ is negligible compared to $D/a$, so we adopt $N \\approx D/a$ as the estimate of the number of atoms across the diameter to within order-unity uncertainty.\n\nSubstituting the given values,\n$$\nN \\approx \\frac{20\\,\\text{nm}}{0.36\\,\\text{nm}} \\approx 55.555\\ldots.\n$$\nRounding to two significant figures gives\n$$\nN \\approx 56.\n$$\n\nImplications for defining a smooth stress field within continuum mechanics can be reasoned from the foundational definition of Cauchy stress. Cauchy stress at a point is defined as the limit of the traction vector, which is the force per unit area transmitted across a surface, as the area shrinks to zero while remaining sufficiently large to contain many microstructural constituents, so that the local force fluctuations average out. In atomistic terms, the traction over an area element emerges from sums of discrete interatomic forces crossing that element. For the continuum limit to exist and be smooth, an averaging domain of characteristic size $L$ must satisfy $L \\gg a$, and the representative volume element (RVE) must contain many atoms so that fluctuations scale down as approximately $1/\\sqrt{n}$, where $n$ is the number of atoms contributing.\n\nWith $N \\approx D/a \\approx 56$ atomic spacings across the diameter, the cross-section accommodates on the order of $N^{2} \\sim 3 \\times 10^{3}$ lattice sites if one imagines a square of side $D$ for a crude count; for a circular cross-section the factor is $\\pi/4$, but the order of magnitude is similar. Although this is more than a few atoms, it is still small enough that:\n- A non-negligible fraction of atoms resides within a surface layer of thickness on the order of $a$. The fraction of the cross-sectional area within one lattice spacing of the surface is approximately $1 - (1 - 2a/D)^{2}$; inserting $a/D \\approx 0.018$ gives a surface-influenced area fraction of order $7 \\times 10^{-2}$, which is not negligible for local fields.\n- Any averaging area small compared to the diameter but large compared to $a$ will still include only tens to hundreds of atoms, leading to significant discrete fluctuations in local traction that do not vanish in the limit of the area shrinking to zero, because the lower bound on the averaging domain is set by the atomic spacing.\n\nTherefore, while a global or cross-sectionally averaged stress may be defined, the classical continuum notion of a pointwise smooth Cauchy stress field becomes questionable at this scale, especially near the free surface where atomic coordination and bonding are highly nonuniform. This illustrates a limitation of continuum mechanics at the nanoscale: the absence of a clear scale separation between $a$ and the characteristic dimension $D$ undermines the assumptions underlying smooth field definitions.\n\nThe requested final numerical output is the estimated number of atoms across the diameter, rounded to two significant figures:\n$$\nN \\approx 56.\n$$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{56}$$", "id": "2776931"}, {"introduction": "As structures shrink, their surface-to-volume ratio grows dramatically, amplifying the mechanical role of surface energy and stress—phenomena that are typically negligible at the macroscale.
