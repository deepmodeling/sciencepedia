The general solution for this in elasticity is of the form $u^{\\mathrm{out}}_r(r) = D/r^2$ for some constant $D$.\nThe strain components are:\n$$\n\\varepsilon^{\\mathrm{out}}_{rr} = \\frac{d u^{\\mathrm{out}}_r}{dr} = -\\frac{2D}{r^3}\n$$\n$$\n\\varepsilon^{\\mathrm{out}}_{\\theta\\theta} = \\varepsilon^{\\mathrm{out}}_{\\phi\\phi} = \\frac{u^{\\mathrm{out}}_r}{r} = \\frac{D}{r^3}\n$$\nSince the eigenstrain is zero outside, these are also the elastic strains. The trace of the strain is $\\varepsilon^{\\mathrm{out}}_{kk} = \\varepsilon^{\\mathrm{out}}_{rr} + \\varepsilon^{\\mathrm{out}}_{\\theta\\theta} + \\varepsilon^{\\mathrm{out}}_{\\phi\\phi} = 0$.\nThe radial stress component outside is:\n$$\n\\sigma^{\\mathrm{out}}_{rr} = \\lambda \\varepsilon^{\\mathrm{out}}_{kk} + 2\\mu \\varepsilon^{\\mathrm{out}}_{rr} = \\lambda(0) + 2\\mu \\left(-\\frac{2D}{r^3}\\right) = -\\frac{4\\mu D}{r^3}\n$$\n\nBoundary Conditions at the interface $r=a$:\nTo maintain material continuity, both the displacement and the radial stress component must be continuous across the interface.\n$1.$ Continuity of displacement: $u^{\\mathrm{in}}_r(a) = u^{\\mathrm{out}}_r(a)$\n$$\nCa = \\frac{D}{a^2} \\implies D = C a^3\n$$\n$2.$ Continuity of radial stress: $\\sigma^{\\mathrm{in}}_{rr}(a) = \\sigma^{\\mathrm{out}}_{rr}(a)$\n$$\n(3\\lambda + 2\\mu)(C - \\varepsilon_{0}) = -\\frac{4\\mu D}{a^3}\n$$\nSubstituting $D = C a^3$ into the stress continuity equation:\n$$\n(3\\lambda + 2\\mu)(C - \\varepsilon_{0}) = -\\frac{4\\mu (C a^3)}{a^3} = -4\\mu C\n$$\nWe now solve for $C$:\n$$\n(3\\lambda + 2\\mu)C - (3\\lambda + 2\\mu)\\varepsilon_{0} = -4\\mu C\n$$\n$$\nC (3\\lambda + 2\\mu + 4\\mu) = (3\\lambda + 2\\mu)\\varepsilon_{0}\n$$\n$$\nC (3\\lambda + 6\\mu) = (3\\lambda + 2\\mu)\\varepsilon_{0}\n$$\n$$\nC = \\left(\\frac{3\\lambda + 2\\mu}{3\\lambda + 6\\mu}\\right) \\varepsilon_{0}\n$$\nFrom the problem definition, $\\varepsilon^{\\mathrm{in}}_{ij} = \\alpha \\varepsilon_{0} \\delta_{ij}$, which implies $C = \\alpha \\varepsilon_{0}$.
