It contains no logical contradictions, missing information, or pseudo-scientific claims. Therefore, the problem is **valid**. A solution will be derived.\n\n### Derivation and Option Analysis\n\nThe connection between the energy release rate $G$ and the stress intensity factor $K_I$ is a central result of LEFM, derived by G. R. Irwin. This relationship depends on the state of stress at the crack tip.\n\nThe two idealised two-dimensional states are:\n1.  **Plane Stress:** This state, defined by $\\sigma_{zz} = \\sigma_{xz} = \\sigma_{yz} = 0$, is a good approximation for thin plates where stresses cannot develop through the thickness. The out-of-plane strain is generally non-zero: $\\varepsilon_{zz} = -\\frac{\\nu}{E}(\\sigma_{xx} + \\sigma_{yy})$.\n2.  **Plane Strain:** This state, defined by $\\varepsilon_{zz} = \\varepsilon_{xz} = \\varepsilon_{yz} = 0$, is a good approximation for the interior of thick plates where the bulk material constrains out-of-plane deformation. A non-zero out-of-plane stress develops: $\\sigma_{zz} = \\nu(\\sigma_{xx} + \\sigma_{yy})$.\n\nThe relationship between $G$ and $K_I$ is given by $G = \\frac{K_I^2}{E'}$, where $E'$ is the effective elastic modulus.\n*   For **plane stress**, $E' = E$.\n*   For **plane strain**, $E' = \\frac{E}{1-\\nu^2}$.\nSince for engineering materials $0  \\nu \\le 0.5$, it follows that $1-\\nu^2  1$, and thus $\\frac{E}{1-\\nu^2} > E$. This reflects the fact that a material in a state of plane strain is effectively stiffer than one in plane stress because of the constraint on deformation in the thickness direction.\n\nThe physical state at a crack tip is three-dimensional. At the free surfaces of the plate (at $z = \\pm B/2$), the condition $\\sigma_{zz} = 0$ must be met, which corresponds to plane stress. In the interior of a sufficiently thick plate, the material is constrained, and the state approaches plane strain, where $\\varepsilon_{zz} \\approx 0$.\n\nThe question of which state dominates is resolved by comparing the plate thickness $B$ to the characteristic length scale of nonlinearity (plasticity) near the crack tip. This scale is the plastic zone size, estimated by Irwin as $r_p$. In the small-scale yielding regime, its size is proportional to $(K_I/\\sigma_Y)^2$.\n*   If $B \\gg r_p$, the plastic zone is small compared to the thickness. A significant portion of the crack front in the plate's interior is subjected to the plane strain constraint imposed by the surrounding elastic material. This is the **plane strain** case.\n*   If $B$ is on the order of or smaller than $r_p$, the constraint is lost across the entire thickness. The free-surface effect dominates, allowing for out-of-plane contraction, and the state across the thickness approaches **plane stress**.\n\nNow, we evaluate each option.\n\n**A. In isotropic LEFM, $G$ and $K_I$ are related by $G = K_I^2/E'$, with $E' = E$ for plane stress and $E' = E/(1-\\nu^2)$ for plane strain. Increasing the thickness $B$ relative to the size of the nonlinear process zone suppresses out-of-plane strain, so that the crack-tip fields become more plane strain; very thin plates tend toward plane stress.**\nThis statement is entirely accurate. The formulas for $E'$ in plane stress and plane strain are correct. The qualitative description of the effect of thickness $B$ is also correct: thickness provides constraint, suppressing out-of-plane strain ($\\varepsilon_z$) and driving the system towards a plane strain state. Thin plates lack this constraint and tend toward plane stress. **Correct**.\n\n**B. Because lateral contraction is prevented in thin sheets, thin specimens are closer to plane strain than thick ones; therefore, for thin specimens the appropriate $E'$ is $E' = E/(1-\\nu^2)$.**\nThis statement is fundamentally flawed. Lateral contraction (in the thickness direction) is *not* prevented in thin sheets; on the contrary, it is facilitated by the proximity of the free surfaces. This lack of constraint is what defines the plane stress condition. The statement incorrectly concludes that thin specimens are closer to plane strain, which is the state of maximum constraint. Consequently, the assigned effective modulus is also incorrect for thin specimens. **Incorrect**.\n\n**C. The appropriate effective modulus for plane strain is $E' = E(1-\\nu^2)$, because geometric constraint makes the material effectively stiffer.**\nThe reasoning that geometric constraint makes the material effectively stiffer is correct. However, this increased stiffness means $E' > E$. The formula provided is $E' = E(1-\\nu^2)$. Since $1-\\nu^2  1$, this formula implies $E'  E$, which contradicts the reasoning and the established fact. The correct formula is $E' = E/(1-\\nu^2)$. The statement contains a fatal mathematical error. **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. The geometric scale that controls whether the near-tip fields are plane stress or plane strain is the crack length $a$: when $a \\gg B$ the fields are plane strain, and when $a \\ll B$ the fields are plane stress.**\nThis statement misidentifies the relevant length scale. While the ratio $a/B$ is important for overall specimen geometry factors, the local constraint state at the crack tip is governed by the competition between the tendency to deform plastically and the geometric constraint provided by the thickness. The controlling physical parameter is therefore the ratio of the thickness $B$ to the plastic zone size $r_p$, not the ratio of the crack length $a$ to the thickness $B$. **Incorrect**.\n\n**E. Provided small-scale yielding holds, a necessary condition to realize a plane-strain dominated region near the crack tip is $B$ much larger than the Irwin plastic-zone size $r_p \\sim c\\,(K_I/\\sigma_Y)^2$ (with $c$ an order-unity constant), ensuring an interior zone where out-of-plane strain is suppressed and $\\varepsilon_z \\approx 0$; otherwise $\\sigma_z \\approx 0$ through the thickness and the fields relax toward plane stress.**\nThis statement provides a physically rigorous and correct explanation. It correctly identifies the controlling condition for achieving a plane strain state as the thickness $B$ being much larger than the plastic zone size $r_p$. It correctly provides the scaling for $r_p$ and correctly links the condition $B \\gg r_p$ to the suppression of out-of-plane strain ($\\varepsilon_z \\approx 0$), which defines plane strain. It also correctly describes the alternative, where this condition is not met, as a relaxation towards a plane stress state ($\\sigma_z \\approx 0$).

It represents a standard analysis within the framework of Linear Elastic Fracture Mechanics (LEFM). We shall proceed with the solution in four parts as requested.\n\nPart 1: Expression for the Stress Intensity Factor $K_I$.\nThe stress field near the tip of a crack under mode I loading, according to the Williams expansion for linear elastic materials, has a characteristic inverse square-root singularity. For a position $(r, \\theta)$ in a polar coordinate system centered at the crack tip, the dominant term of the stress tensor $\\sigma_{ij}$ is given by\n$$\n\\sigma_{ij}(r, \\theta) = \\frac{K_I}{\\sqrt{2\\pi r}} f_{ij}(\\theta) + O(r^0)\n$$\nwhere $K_I$ is the mode I stress intensity factor and $f_{ij}(\\theta)$ are dimensionless functions of the angle $\\theta$.\n\nFrom dimensional analysis, the stress intensity factor $K_I$ must have units of stress times the square root of length, i.e., $[\\text{Force}][\\text{Length}]^{-3/2}$. The problem involves a remote stress $\\sigma$ and a characteristic length, the crack size $a$. A simple dimensional combination is $\\sigma\\sqrt{a}$. For a crack in an infinite body, a factor of $\\sqrt{\\pi}$ is conventionally included. The presence of finite boundaries, such as the finite width $W$ of the plate, modifies this relationship by a dimensionless geometry function, $Y$, which depends on the ratio of the crack length to the width, $\\alpha = a/W$. Therefore, the general form for the mode I stress intensity factor for this configuration is\n$$\nK_I = Y(\\alpha) \\sigma \\sqrt{\\pi a}\n$$\nThe provided polynomial $Y(\\alpha)$ is an empirical fit for this specific geometry. As $\\alpha \\to 0$, $Y(0) = 1.12$, which correctly matches the known solution for a single edge crack in a semi-infinite plate ($K_I = 1.12 \\sigma \\sqrt{\\pi a}$).\n\nPart 2: Relation between Energy Release Rate $G$ and $K_I$.\nIn Linear Elastic Fracture Mechanics (LEFM), the energy release rate $G$ is directly related to the stress intensity factor $K_I$. This relationship can be derived by considering the work done to close an infinitesimal extension of the crack or by evaluating the path-independent $J$-integral around the crack tip using the known asymptotic stress and displacement fields. For a linear elastic material, $G$ is equivalent to $J$.\n\nThe specific form of the relationship depends on the out-of-plane constraint (plane stress or plane strain).
