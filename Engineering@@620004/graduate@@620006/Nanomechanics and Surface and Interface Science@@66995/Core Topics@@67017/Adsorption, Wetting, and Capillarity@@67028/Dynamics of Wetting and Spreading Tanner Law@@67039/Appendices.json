It presents a well-posed, scientifically grounded problem in the field of fluid dynamics, specifically concerning the spreading of a liquid droplet, which leads to the derivation of Tanner's law. The assumptions provided are standard and sufficient for a rigorous derivation. We proceed to the solution.\n\nThe problem requires a step-by-step derivation of the spreading exponent for a droplet under specific physical assumptions. We shall address each required part systematically.\n\nFirst, we establish the relationship between the capillary driving force and the dynamic contact angle $\\theta(t)$. The problem states that the droplet is on a perfectly wetting solid, for which the equilibrium contact angle is $\\theta_e=0$. The net horizontal capillary driving force on the contact line, per unit length, arises from the uncompensated projection of the liquid-vapor surface tension $\\gamma$. This force is given by $F_{drive} = \\gamma (\\cos\\theta_e - \\cos\\theta)$. For $\\theta_e = 0$, this simplifies to $F_{drive} = \\gamma(1 - \\cos\\theta)$. Given the assumption of a small contact angle, $\\theta \\ll 1$, we expand the cosine function to leading order: $\\cos\\theta \\approx 1 - \\frac{\\theta^2}{2}$. The driving force per unit length is therefore $F_{drive} \\approx \\gamma\\left(1 - \\left(1 - \\frac{\\theta^2}{2}\\right)\\right) = \\frac{1}{2}\\gamma\\theta^2$. The mechanical power input per unit length of the contact line, which drives the spreading, is this force multiplied by the contact line velocity $U = \\frac{\\mathrm{d}R}{\\mathrm{d}t}$. Thus, the power input is $P_{in} = F_{drive} U \\approx \\frac{1}{2}\\gamma\\theta^2 U$.\n\nSecond, we calculate the rate of viscous energy dissipation. Dissipation is concentrated in the slender wedge-shaped region near the contact line, where velocity gradients are largest. We model this region for $\\ell \\le x \\le L$ with a height profile $h(x,t) \\approx \\theta(t) x$, where $x$ is the distance from the contact line into the drop, $\\ell$ is a microscopic cutoff length, and $L \\sim R(t)$ is a macroscopic cutoff on the order of the drop radius. In the lubrication approximation, the flow is governed by the Stokes equation $\\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial x} = \\mu \\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial z^2}$. Mass conservation in this region is expressed as $\\frac{\\partial h}{\\partial t} + \\frac{\\partial q}{\\partial x} = 0$, where $q(x) = \\int_0^{h(x)} u(x,z) \\mathrm{d}z$ is the volume flux. For a profile $h(x) = \\theta x$ where $x$ is measured from the moving contact line, this translates to $-\\theta U + \\frac{\\partial q}{\\partial x} = 0$, yielding $q(x) = \\theta U x$ (assuming $q(0)=0$). The flux for a Poiseuille flow with a no-slip condition at $z=0$ and a zero-stress condition at the free surface $z=h$ is $q = -\\frac{h^3}{3\\mu}\\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial x}$. Equating the two expressions for the flux, we find the pressure gradient: $\\theta U x = -\\frac{(\\theta x)^3}{3\\mu}\\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial x}$, which gives $\\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial x} = -\\frac{3\\mu U}{\\theta^2 x^2}$.\nThe viscous dissipation rate per unit volume is $\\mu (\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial z})^2$. The velocity gradient is $\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial z} = \\frac{1}{\\mu}\\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial x}(z-h)$. The dissipation rate per unit length of the contact line, $\\dot{E}_{diss}$, is found by integrating the dissipation density over the volume of the wedge:\n$$\n\\dot{E}_{diss} = \\int_{\\ell}^{L} \\mathrm{d}x \\int_{0}^{h(x)} \\mu \\left(\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial z}\\right)^2 \\mathrm{d}z\n$$\nThe integral over $z$ is $\\int_{0}^{h} \\mu \\left(\\frac{1}{\\mu}\\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial x}(z-h)\\right)^2 \\mathrm{d}z = \\frac{1}{\\mu}\\left(\\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial x}\\right)^2 \\frac{h^3}{3}$.

Note that we have used $L \\sim R$ as instructed. The Laplace pressure argument leads to an internal pressure of $\\Delta p \\approx \\frac{2\\gamma\\theta}{R}$, which sets the pressure scale for the pressure gradient that drives the flow which we have implicitly accounted for in our flux-based derivation.\n\nThird, we enforce the energy balance by equating the capillary power input to the viscous dissipation rate: $P_{in} = \\dot{E}_{diss}$.\n$$\n\\frac{1}{2}\\gamma\\theta^2 U = \\frac{3\\mu U^2}{\\theta} \\ln\\left(\\frac{R}{\\ell}\\right)\n$$\nAssuming $U \\neq 0$, we solve for the speed $U$:\n$$\nU = \\frac{\\gamma\\theta^3}{6\\mu \\ln(R/\\ell)}\n$$\nThis relationship, $U \\propto \\theta^3$, is a variant of the Cox-Voinov law.\n\nFinally, we derive the temporal evolution of the radius $R(t)$. The droplet is assumed to maintain a spherical-cap shape with a constant volume $V$. For a small contact angle $\\theta$, the volume of a spherical cap of base radius $R$ is approximated by $V \\approx \\frac{\\pi}{4}R^3\\theta$.

The receding threshold magnitude is:\n$$f_{R}^{\\star} = \\gamma(\\cos\\theta_{e} - \\cos\\theta_{R})$$\nWith $\\theta_{e} = 0^{\\circ}$ and the static receding angle $\\theta_{R} = 60^{\\circ}$:\n$$f_{R}^{\\star} = \\gamma(\\cos 0^{\\circ} - \\cos 60^{\\circ})$$\nUsing $\\cos 60^{\\circ} = 0.5$:\n$$f_{R}^{\\star} = \\gamma(1 - 0.5) = 0.5\\gamma$$\nThe condition for receding is $-f_{Y,0} > f_{R}^{\\star}$. We already calculated $f_{Y,0} \\approx 0.0152\\gamma$. So we must check:\n$$-0.0152\\gamma > 0.5\\gamma$$\nThis is also false, as a negative number cannot be greater than a positive number. This confirms the physical intuition that a force directed outwards cannot cause an inward motion.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nSince neither the condition for advancing ($f_{Y,0} > f_{A}$) nor the condition for receding ($-f_{Y,0} > f_{R}^{\\star}$) is satisfied, the contact line will remain stationary. It is \"pinned\" at its initial position. The droplet footprint will not grow macroscopically.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. It will spread according to Tanner-type scaling of the footprint radius with time because $\\theta_{e}=0^{\\circ}$ guarantees spontaneous spreading regardless of hysteresis.**\nThis statement is fundamentally flawed. While $\\theta_{e}=0^{\\circ}$ indicates a thermodynamic preference for complete spreading, it does not \"guarantee\" it in the presence of kinetic barriers. Contact angle hysteresis provides precisely such a barrier. Our analysis shows that this barrier is sufficient to prevent macroscopic motion. Therefore, Tanner's law, which describes spreading on an ideal surface without hysteresis, is not applicable here.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**B. It will remain pinned at its initial footprint because the capillary driving force $f_{Y}$ is insufficient to overcome the advancing threshold $f_{A}$, and the sign of $f_{Y}$ is incompatible with receding; any spreading will be limited to a nanometric precursor film without macroscopic Tanner-type growth.**\nThis statement is fully consistent with our derivation. We have shown that the driving force $f_{Y,0}$ is positive but less than the advancing threshold $f_A$. This leads to pinning. The assertion that the positive sign of $f_{Y}$ is incompatible with receding is also correct. The final clause about a nanometric precursor film is a physically correct and relevant detail for complete wetting systems ($\\theta_e = 0^{\\circ}$) where the macroscopic contact line is pinned. The formation of such a film is driven by long-range forces and does not constitute macroscopic Tanner-type spreading.\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\n**C. It will spontaneously recede until the apparent contact angle increases to $\\theta_{R}=60^{\\circ}$, at which point it will pin.**\nThis statement describes a motion opposite to the direction of the driving force. The initial angle $\\theta_{0}=10^{\\circ}$ is greater than the equilibrium angle $\\theta_{e}=0^{\\circ}$, leading to a positive (outward) force $f_{Y,0}$. The system seeks to decrease, not increase, its contact angle. Recession is physically impossible in this situation.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. It will advance with a modified power-law exponent for the footprint radius (for example, $R\\sim t^{1/7}$) set by hysteresis, instead of the Tanner exponent, even without external forcing.**\nThis statement is incorrect because it presupposes that the droplet advances. Our analysis has concluded that the droplet is statically pinned and does not advance at all. While some theories predict that dynamic hysteresis can modify spreading exponents, this is only relevant if the static pinning threshold has been overcome and motion is occurring. As there is no macroscopic motion, the question of the power-law exponent is moot.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2769594"}]}
