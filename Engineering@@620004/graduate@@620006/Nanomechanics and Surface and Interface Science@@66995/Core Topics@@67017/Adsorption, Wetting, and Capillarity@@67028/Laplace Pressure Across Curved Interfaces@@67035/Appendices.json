The derivation and calculation will proceed as requested.\n\nThe relationship between the pressure difference across a curved interface and the surface tension is derived from the principle of virtual work at thermodynamic equilibrium. We consider a spherical droplet of radius $R$ and analyze the mechanical equilibrium under a virtual, infinitesimal, reversible expansion of its radius by an amount $dR$. At equilibrium, the total virtual work $\\delta W_{\\text{total}}$ done by all forces (internal pressure, external pressure, and surface tension) must be zero.\n\nThe total virtual work is the sum of three contributions:\n$1$. The work done by the internal pressure $p_{\\text{in}}$ pushing the interface outwards. The force is $F_{\\text{in}} = p_{\\text{in}} A = p_{\\text{in}} (4\\pi R^2)$. The virtual work done by this force over a displacement $dR$ is:\n$$ \\delta W_{\\text{in}} = F_{\\text{in}} dR = p_{\\text{in}} (4\\pi R^2) dR $$\n$2$. The work done by the external pressure $p_{\\text{out}}$ resisting the expansion. This force acts inwards. The virtual work done by this force is:\n$$ \\delta W_{\\text{out}} = -F_{\\text{out}} dR = -p_{\\text{out}} (4\\pi R^2) dR $$\n$3$. The work done by the force of surface tension. Surface tension, $\\gamma$, represents the surface free energy per unit area. The total surface energy of the droplet is $E_{\\text{surf}} = \\gamma A = \\gamma (4\\pi R^2)$. This energy tends to a minimum, meaning surface tension acts as a force that contracts the surface. The work that must be done *against* surface tension to create new surface area is $\\delta W_{\\text{against_surf}} = \\gamma dA$. The change in area is $dA = d(4\\pi R^2) = 8\\pi R dR$. Therefore, the work done *by* the surface tension force during the expansion is the negative of this energy increase:\n$$ \\delta W_{\\text{surf}} = -\\gamma dA = -\\gamma (8\\pi R dR) $$\n\nThe condition for mechanical equilibrium is that the total virtual work is zero:\n$$ \\delta W_{\\text{total}} = \\delta W_{\\text{in}} + \\delta W_{\\text{out}} + \\delta W_{\\text{surf}} = 0 $$\n$$ p_{\\text{in}} (4\\pi R^2) dR - p_{\\text{out}} (4\\pi R^2) dR - \\gamma (8\\pi R dR) = 0 $$\nWe divide the entire equation by $4\\pi R dR$, which is non-zero for a virtual expansion of a finite droplet:\n$$ R(p_{\\text{in}} - p_{\\text{out}}) - 2\\gamma = 0 $$\nRearranging this expression gives the pressure jump, $\\Delta p = p_{\\text{in}} - p_{\\text{out}}$, across the spherical interface:\n$$ \\Delta p = p_{\\text{in}} - p_{\\text{out}} = \\frac{2\\gamma}{R} $$\nThis is the Young-Laplace equation for a spherical interface.

It is therefore deemed **valid**. We may proceed with the solution.\n\n### Derivation\nThe pressure jump, $\\Delta p$, across a curved liquid-gas interface is described by the Young-Laplace equation. For an axisymmetric meniscus of constant mean curvature, the surface is a segment of a sphere. The Young-Laplace equation is:\n$$p_{\\text{concave}} - p_{\\text{convex}} = \\frac{2\\gamma}{R}$$\nwhere $R$ is the radius of curvature of the spherical meniscus, and $p_{\\text{concave}}$ and $p_{\\text{convex}}$ are the pressures on the concave and convex sides of the interface, respectively.\n\nThe problem specifies contact angles $\\theta_{\\mathrm{R}}=30^\\circ$ and $\\theta_{\\mathrm{A}}=60^\\circ$. Since both angles are less than $90^\\circ$, the liquid is wetting the solid. In a cylindrical pore, a wetting liquid forms a meniscus that is concave when viewed from the gas phase. Therefore, the gas is on the concave side and the liquid is on the convex side of the interface. This implies $p_{\\mathrm{gas}} > p_{\\mathrm{liquid}}$.\n\nFrom the Young-Laplace equation, we have:\n$$p_{\\mathrm{gas}} - p_{\\mathrm{liquid}} = \\frac{2\\gamma}{R}$$\nThe problem defines the pressure jump as $\\Delta p \\equiv p_{\\mathrm{liquid}} - p_{\\mathrm{gas}}$. Thus, we must write:\n$$\\Delta p = - \\frac{2\\gamma}{R}$$\n\nNext, we must relate the radius of curvature $R$ to the pore radius $a$ and the contact angle $\\theta$. The contact angle $\\theta$ is measured between the tangent to the meniscus at the wall and the wall itself, through the liquid. Due to the pinning at the pore edge (radius $a$), a simple geometric construction can be made. A right-angled triangle is formed by the center of curvature of the meniscus, the center of the circular pore opening, and a point on the pinned contact line. The hypotenuse of this triangle is the radius of curvature $R$, the side adjacent to the angle $\\theta$ is the pore radius $a$. Therefore, the relationship is:\n$$a = R \\cos\\theta$$\nSolving for $R$ yields:\n$$R = \\frac{a}{\\cos\\theta}$$\nNote that for $\\theta < 90^\\circ$, $\\cos\\theta > 0$, so $R$ is positive, as is required for a radius magnitude.\n\nSubstituting this expression for $R$ into the equation for $\\Delta p$:\n$$\\Delta p(\\theta) = - \\frac{2\\gamma}{a / \\cos\\theta} = - \\frac{2\\gamma\\cos\\theta}{a}$$\nThis equation gives the pressure jump as a a function of the contact angle $\\theta$.\n\nThe contact line is pinned, and the meniscus is stable for any contact angle $\\theta$ in the range of hysteresis, $\\theta \\in [\\theta_{\\mathrm{R}}, \\theta_{\\mathrm{A}}]$. To find the corresponding range for $\\Delta p$, we must examine the function $\\Delta p(\\theta)$. The function $\\cos\\theta$ is monotonically decreasing for $\\theta \\in [0, \\pi]$. Since $\\theta_{\\mathrm{A}} > \\theta_{\\mathrm{R}}$ (and both are in $[0, \\pi/2]$), it follows that $\\cos\\theta_{\\mathrm{A}} < \\cos\\theta_{\\mathrm{R}}$.\n\nThe function for the pressure jump is $\\Delta p(\\theta) = (-\\frac{2\\gamma}{a}) \\cos\\theta$. We are multiplying $\\cos\\theta$ by a negative constant, $(-\\frac{2\\gamma}{a})$. Multiplying an inequality by a negative number reverses the direction of the inequality.\nTherefore, from $\\cos\\theta_{\\mathrm{A}} < \\cos\\theta_{\\mathrm{R}}$, we have:\n$$(-\\frac{2\\gamma}{a})\\cos\\theta_{\\mathrm{A}} > (-\\frac{2\\gamma}{a})\\cos\\theta_{\\mathrm{R}}$$\nThis means that the minimum value of $\\Delta p$ occurs at $\\theta = \\theta_{\\mathrm{R}}$ and the maximum value occurs at $\\theta = \\theta_{\\mathrm{A}}$.\n$$\\Delta p_{\\mathrm{min}} = - \\frac{2\\gamma\\cos\\theta_{\\mathrm{R}}}{a}$$\n$$\\Delta p_{\\mathrm{max}} = - \\frac{2\\gamma\\cos\\theta_{\\mathrm{A}}}{a}$$\nThe admissible range for the pressure jump for a stable, pinned meniscus is:\n$$\\Delta p \\in \\left[ - \\frac{2\\gamma\\cos\\theta_{\\mathrm{R}}}{a}, - \\frac{2\\gamma\\cos\\theta_{\\mathrm{A}}}{a} \\right]$$\n\nNow, we calculate the numerical values using the provided data:\n$a = 50\\,\\mathrm{nm} = 50 \\times 10^{-9}\\,\\mathrm{m}$\n$\\gamma = 0.072\\,\\mathrm{N/m}$\n$\\theta_{\\mathrm{R}} = 30^\\circ \\implies \\cos(30^\\circ) = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} \\approx 0.8660$\n$\\theta_{\\mathrm{A}} = 60^\\circ \\implies \\cos(60^\\circ) = \\frac{1}{2} = 0.5$\n\nCalculating the bounds:\n$$\\Delta p_{\\mathrm{min}} = - \\frac{2(0.072\\,\\mathrm{N/m})\\cos(30^\\circ)}{50 \\times 10^{-9}\\,\\mathrm{m}} \\approx - \\frac{0.144 \\times 0.8660}{5 \\times 10^{-8}}\\,\\mathrm{Pa} = -2.494 \\times 10^6\\,\\mathrm{Pa} = -2.49\\,\\mathrm{MPa}$$\n$$\\Delta p_{\\mathrm{max}} = - \\frac{2(0.072\\,\\mathrm{N/m})\\cos(60^\\circ)}{50 \\times 10^{-9}\\,\\mathrm{m}} = - \\frac{0.144 \\times 0.5}{5 \\times 10^{-8}}\\,\\mathrm{Pa} = -1.44 \\times 10^6\\,\\mathrm{Pa} = -1.44\\,\\mathrm{MPa}$$\nSo, the stable pressure jump range is approximately $\\Delta p \\in [-2.49\\,\\mathrm{MPa}, -1.44\\,\\mathrm{MPa}]$.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A.

For standard interval notation $[x, y]$, it must be that $x \\le y$. Since $\\Delta p_{\\mathrm{max}} > \\Delta p_{\\mathrm{min}}$ (i.e., $-1.44 > -2.49$), the written interval is mathematically malformed.\n- **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C.

As derived, for a wetting liquid ($\\theta < 90^\\circ$), the pressure inside the liquid is lower than in the gas, so $\\Delta p = p_{\\mathrm{liquid}} - p_{\\mathrm{gas}}$ must be negative.

The pressure jump is fundamentally dependent on the contact angle, which determines the meniscus curvature. Hysteresis allows for a range of stable angles, thus a range of stable pressures, not a single value.\n- **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**E. Contact angle hysteresis does not bound the pressure because the contact line is pinned; $\\Delta p$ is unbounded until depinning.**\n- This statement is physically false. Pinning allows the contact angle to vary, but only within the hysteretic range $[\\theta_{\\mathrm{R}}, \\theta_{\\mathrm{A}}]$. The Young-Laplace equation links each angle $\\theta$ to a specific pressure jump $\\Delta p$.

For a spherical interface of radius $R$, the pressure difference between the interior, $p_{\\mathrm{int}}$, and the exterior, $p_{\\mathrm{ext}}$, is given by the Young-Laplace equation. In this context, the exterior pressure is the ambient pressure in the liquid, $p_{\\mathrm{amb}}(R)$.

The volume of the spherical bubble is $V = \\frac{4}{3}\\pi R^3$. Since the number of molecules $N$ and the temperature $T$ are constant, their product is a constant.

We must express this equation in terms of the dimensionless variables $\\Pi \\equiv \\frac{p_{\\mathrm{amb}}(R)}{p_{a0}}$, $x \\equiv \\frac{R}{R_0}$, and $s \\equiv \\frac{2\\gamma}{p_{a0} R_0}$.\nWe divide the entire equation for $p_{\\mathrm{amb}}(R)$ by the reference ambient pressure $p_{a0}$:\n$$\\frac{p_{\\mathrm{amb}}(R)}{p_{a0}} = \\frac{1}{p_{a0}} \\left[ \\frac{\\left( p_{a0} + \\frac{2\\gamma}{R_0} \\right) R_0^3}{R^3} - \\frac{2\\gamma}{R} \\right]$$\nThis becomes:\n$$\\Pi(x, s) = \\left( \\frac{p_{a0}}{p_{a0}} + \\frac{2\\gamma}{p_{a0}R_0} \\right) \\left( \\frac{R_0}{R} \\right)^3 - \\frac{2\\gamma}{p_{a0}R}$$\nNow, we substitute the dimensionless variables.\nThe term $\\frac{2\\gamma}{p_{a0}R_0}$ is defined as $s$.\nThe term $\\left(\\frac{R_0}{R}\\right)^3$ is $\\left(\\frac{1}{x}\\right)^3 = x^{-3}$.\nThe last term, $\\frac{2\\gamma}{p_{a0}R}$, can be rewritten as:\n$$\\frac{2\\gamma}{p_{a0}R} = \\left( \\frac{2\\gamma}{p_{a0}R_0} \\right) \\left( \\frac{R_0}{R} \\right) = s \\cdot \\frac{1}{x} = sx^{-1}$$\nSubstituting these into the expression for $\\Pi$:\n$$\\Pi(x, s) = (1 + s) x^{-3} - s x^{-1}$$\nFor clarity, this can also be written in fractional form:\n$$\\Pi(x, s) = \\frac{1+s}{x^3} - \\frac{s}{x}$$\nThis is the final closed-form, dimensionless relation for the ambient pressure ratio $\\Pi$ as a function of the dimensionless radius $x$ and the dimensionless capillary parameter $s$.\n\nTo verify, we check the reference state where $R=R_0$, so $x=1$.\n$$\\Pi(1, s) = \\frac{1+s}{1^3} - \\frac{s}{1} = 1+s-s = 1$$\nThis implies $\\frac{p_{\\mathrm{amb}}(R_0)}{p_{a0}} = 1$, or $p_{\\mathrm{amb}}(R_0) = p_{a0}$, which is consistent with the problem definition.
