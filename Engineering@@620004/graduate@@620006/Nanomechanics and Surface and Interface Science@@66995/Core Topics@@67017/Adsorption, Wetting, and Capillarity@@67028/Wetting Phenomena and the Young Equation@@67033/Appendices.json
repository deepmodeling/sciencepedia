The provided data are numerically consistent and physically plausible, and the assumptions are standard for applying classical wetting theory. The problem is well-posed and contains no ambiguities or contradictions.\n\nThe first task is to evaluate the spreading parameter, $S$, which determines whether the liquid spreads completely over the solid surface or forms a droplet with a finite contact angle. The spreading parameter is defined as the negative of the change in surface free energy per unit area when a dry solid surface is covered by a liquid film.

Therefore, a stable, non-zero equilibrium contact angle exists.\n\nFor partial wetting, the equilibrium contact angle $\\theta$ is determined by the condition of mechanical equilibrium at the three-phase contact line. The interfacial energies can be interpreted as tensions (force per unit length) acting along their respective interfaces. The balance of the horizontal components of these tensions leads to the Young equation:\n$$\\gamma_{SV} = \\gamma_{SL} + \\gamma_{LV} \\cos(\\theta)$$\nThis equation represents the equilibrium state where the net horizontal force on the contact line is zero.

It requires the derivation of a fundamental relationship in surface science from first principles and its subsequent numerical evaluation. We shall proceed.\n\nThe system involves a three-phase contact line where solid (s), liquid (l), and vapor (v) phases meet. The equilibrium state is governed by the minimization of the total free energy. This can be analyzed from two equivalent perspectives: a mechanical balance of forces at the contact line and a thermodynamic consideration of the work required to alter the interfacial areas.\n\nFirst, we consider the mechanical equilibrium condition at the three-phase contact line, as required by point (i) of the problem. At the contact line, there are three interfacial tensions acting. These are the solid-vapor interfacial tension, $\\gamma_{sv}$; the solid-liquid interfacial tension, $\\gamma_{sl}$; and the liquid-vapor interfacial tension, $\\gamma_{lv}$. Each tension represents a force per unit length acting along the respective interface. For the system to be in mechanical equilibrium, the vector sum of these forces must be zero. We are concerned with the components of these forces parallel to the solid substrate.\n\nThe force due to $\\gamma_{sv}$ acts along the solid-vapor interface.\nThe force due to $\\gamma_{sl}$ acts along the solid-liquid interface, opposing the $\\gamma_{sv}$ force.\nThe force due to $\\gamma_{lv}$ acts tangentially to the liquid-vapor interface at an angle $\\theta$, the equilibrium contact angle, with respect to the solid substrate.\n\nThe balance of forces parallel to the substrate is thus given by:\n$$\n\\gamma_{sv} = \\gamma_{sl} + \\gamma_{lv} \\cos\\theta\n$$\nThis is the celebrated Young's equation. It relates the interfacial tensions to the macroscopic contact angle.\n\nSecond, we consider the thermodynamic definition of the work of adhesion, $W_{ad}$, as stipulated by point (ii) of the problem. The work of adhesion is defined as the reversible work required per unit area to separate a solid-liquid interface, creating a new solid-vapor interface and a new liquid-vapor interface in its place. According to the first law of thermodynamics for an isothermal, reversible process, the work done on the system, $W_{ad}$, equals the change in the total surface free energy of the system, $\\Delta G_{surf}$.\n\nConsider a system with an initial area of contact $A$ between the solid and liquid. The initial surface free energy of this interface is $G_{initial} = \\gamma_{sl} A$. We perform work to separate the liquid from the solid over this area $A$. The final state consists of a solid-vapor interface of area $A$ and a liquid-vapor interface of area $A$. The final surface free energy is $G_{final} = \\gamma_{sv} A + \\gamma_{lv} A$.\n\nThe work of adhesion per unit area, $W_{ad}$, is the work done divided by the area $A$:\n$$\nW_{ad} = \\frac{G_{final} - G_{initial}}{A} = \\frac{(\\gamma_{sv} A + \\gamma_{lv} A) - (\\gamma_{sl} A)}{A}\n$$\nSimplifying this expression gives the Dupre equation for the work of adhesion:\n$$\nW_{ad} = \\gamma_{sv} + \\gamma_{lv} - \\gamma_{sl}\n$$\nThis $W_{ad}$ is precisely the minimum reversible work per unit area to separate the liquid from the solid.\n\nThe problem requires an expression for $W_{ad}$ in terms of only $\\gamma_{lv}$ and $\\theta$. We can achieve this by combining the Young equation and the Dupre equation. From Young's equation, we can express the difference $(\\gamma_{sv} - \\gamma_{sl})$ as:\n$$\n\\gamma_{sv} - \\gamma_{sl} = \\gamma_{lv} \\cos\\theta\n$$\nNow, we substitute this result into the Dupre equation:\n$$\nW_{ad} = (\\gamma_{sv} - \\gamma_{sl}) + \\gamma_{lv} = (\\gamma_{lv} \\cos\\theta) + \\gamma_{lv}\n$$\nFactoring out $\\gamma_{lv}$, we arrive at the desired expression, known as the Young-Dupre equation:\n$$\nW_{ad} = \\gamma_{lv} (1 + \\cos\\theta)\n$$\nThis equation correctly relates the thermodynamic work of adhesion to the macroscopically measurable quantities of liquid-vapor surface tension and contact angle.\n\nFinally, we must evaluate this expression numerically for the given system. The provided values are:\nLiquid-vapor surface tension, $\\gamma_{lv} = 72.0\\,\\mathrm{mN\\,m^{-1}}$.\nEquilibrium contact angle, $\\theta = 108^{\\circ}$.\n\nFirst, we address the units.

It is scientifically sound, well-posed, and contains all necessary information and assumptions to derive the Wenzel equation and apply it to the given parameters. The problem is therefore valid.\n\nPart 1: Derivation of the equilibrium macroscopic contact angle $\\theta_{W}$\n\nThe system seeks to minimize its total interfacial free energy, $G$, subject to the constraint of a fixed liquid volume. The total energy is given by the sum of the energies of the three interfaces:\n$$G = \\gamma_{LV} A_{LV} + \\gamma_{SL} A_{SL} + \\gamma_{SV} A_{SV}$$\nwhere $\\gamma_{LV}$, $\\gamma_{SL}$, and $\\gamma_{SV}$ are the liquid-vapor, solid-liquid, and solid-vapor interfacial tensions, respectively, and $A_{LV}$, $A_{SL}$, and $A_{SV}$ are the corresponding interfacial areas.\n\nThe total true surface area of the solid, $A_{S, \\text{true}}$, is constant. It is partitioned between the wetted area, $A_{SL}$, and the dry area, $A_{SV}$. Thus, $A_{S, \\text{true}} = A_{SL} + A_{SV}$, which implies $A_{SV} = A_{S, \\text{true}} - A_{SL}$. Substituting this into the energy expression gives:\n$$G = \\gamma_{LV} A_{LV} + \\gamma_{SL} A_{SL} + \\gamma_{SV} (A_{S, \\text{true}} - A_{SL})$$\n$$G = \\gamma_{LV} A_{LV} + (\\gamma_{SL} - \\gamma_{SV}) A_{SL} + \\gamma_{SV} A_{S, \\text{true}}$$\nAt equilibrium, the variation of the free energy, $dG$, with respect to a small displacement of the three-phase contact line must be zero, under the constraint of constant volume. The term $\\gamma_{SV} A_{S, \\text{true}}$ is a constant and does not contribute to the variation. Thus, we must have:\n$$dG = \\gamma_{LV} dA_{LV} + (\\gamma_{SL} - \\gamma_{SV}) dA_{SL} = 0$$\nWe now relate the differential changes in area, $dA_{LV}$ and $dA_{SL}$, to a differential change in the projected wetted area, $dA_{\\text{proj}}$. The problem states that the liquid follows the surface topography. The roughness factor is defined as $r = \\frac{A_{\\text{true}}}{A_{\\text{proj}}}$. For a differential change, this means the true change in solid-liquid area, $dA_{SL}$, is related to the change in its horizontal projection, $dA_{\\text{proj}}$, by:\n$$dA_{SL} = r \\, dA_{\\text{proj}}$$\nThe change in the liquid-vapor area, $dA_{LV}$, is related to the displacement of the contact line along the projected plane. For a small advance of the contact line creating a new projected wetted area $dA_{\\text{proj}}$, the corresponding change in the liquid-vapor area is the projection of this new area onto the tangent of the droplet surface at the contact line. This projection introduces a factor of the cosine of the macroscopic contact angle, $\\theta_W$.\n$$dA_{LV} = \\cos(\\theta_{W}) \\, dA_{\\text{proj}}$$\nSubstituting these two relations for $dA_{SL}$ and $dA_{LV}$ into the equilibrium condition $dG=0$:\n$$\\gamma_{LV} (\\cos(\\theta_{W}) \\, dA_{\\text{proj}}) + (\\gamma_{SL} - \\gamma_{SV}) (r \\, dA_{\\text{proj}}) = 0$$\nSince $dA_{\\text{proj}}$ is an arbitrary non-zero variation, we can divide the equation by it:\n$$\\gamma_{LV} \\cos(\\theta_{W}) + r(\\gamma_{SL} - \\gamma_{SV}) = 0$$\nThis yields an expression for the cosine of the macroscopic contact angle on the rough surface:\n$$\\cos(\\theta_{W}) = -r \\frac{\\gamma_{SL} - \\gamma_{SV}}{\\gamma_{LV}} = r \\left( \\frac{\\gamma_{SV} - \\gamma_{SL}}{\\gamma_{LV}} \\right)$$\nNow, we must introduce the Young contact angle, $\\theta_{Y}$, which is the angle on an ideal, smooth surface. On such a surface, the roughness factor $r=1$, and the balance of horizontal forces at the contact line gives the Young's equation:\n$$\\gamma_{SV} = \\gamma_{SL} + \\gamma_{LV} \\cos(\\theta_{Y})$$\nRearranging Young's equation gives:\n$$\\cos(\\theta_{Y}) = \\frac{\\gamma_{SV} - \\gamma_{SL}}{\\gamma_{LV}}$$\nSubstituting this expression for the term in parentheses into our equation for $\\cos(\\theta_{W})$ gives the final relationship, known as the Wenzel equation:\n$$\\cos(\\theta_{W}) = r \\cos(\\theta_{Y})$$\n\nPart 2: Numerical Evaluation\n\nWe are given the Young contact angle $\\theta_{Y} = 100^{\\circ}$ and the roughness factor $r = 1.5$. We use the derived Wenzel equation to find the apparent contact angle $\\theta_{W}$.\nFirst, we compute the cosine of the Young angle:\n$$\\cos(\\theta_{Y}) = \\cos(100^{\\circ}) \\approx -0.173648$$\nNext, we apply the Wenzel equation:\n$$\\cos(\\theta_{W}) = r \\cos(\\theta_{Y}) = 1.5 \\times \\cos(100^{\\circ}) \\approx 1.5 \\times (-0.173648) \\approx -0.260472$$\nFinally, we find the angle $\\theta_{W}$ by taking the arccosine. The angle must be in the range $[0^{\\circ}, 180^{\\circ}]$.\n$$\\theta_{W} = \\arccos(-0.260472) \\approx 105.099^{\\circ}$$\nRounding the result to four significant figures as required gives $\\theta_{W} \\approx 105.1^{\\circ}$.\n\nPart 3: Qualitative Analysis\n\nIn this case, roughness amplifies hydrophobicity. The initial surface is defined as hydrophobic because its Young contact angle $\\theta_{Y} = 100^{\\circ}$ is greater than $90^{\\circ}$, which implies that $\\cos(\\theta_{Y})$ is negative; roughness, characterized by $r > 1$, makes the value of $\\cos(\\theta_{W}) = r \\cos(\\theta_{Y})$ more negative than $\\cos(\\theta_{Y})$, which, due to the monotonic decrease of the arccosine function, results in a larger contact angle $\\theta_{W} > \\theta_{Y}$ and thus enhanced non-wetting behavior.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{105.1}$$", "id": "2797954"}]}
