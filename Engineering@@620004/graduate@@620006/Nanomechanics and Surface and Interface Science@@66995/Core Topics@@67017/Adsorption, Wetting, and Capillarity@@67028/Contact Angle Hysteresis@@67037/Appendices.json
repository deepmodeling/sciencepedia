It presents a standard problem in the physics of wetting, free of any inconsistencies or ambiguities.\n\nThe cornerstone of this analysis is the concept of mechanical equilibrium at the three-phase contact line, where the liquid droplet, the solid substrate, and the surrounding vapor phase meet. For a unit length of this contact line, three forces, which are manifestations of the interfacial free energies per unit area (surface tensions), must be in balance. These are the solid-vapor tension, $\\gamma_{sv}$, acting parallel to the solid surface away from the droplet; the solid-liquid tension, $\\gamma_{sl}$, acting parallel to the solid surface under the droplet; and the liquid-vapor tension, $\\gamma_{lv}$, acting tangentially to the liquid-vapor interface.\n\nThe Young's equilibrium contact angle, $\\theta_Y$, is the angle formed between the solid surface and the tangent to the liquid-vapor interface at the contact line. The balance of forces projected onto the horizontal axis (the plane of the solid substrate) is expressed as:\n$$\n\\gamma_{sv} = \\gamma_{sl} + \\gamma_{lv} \\cos(\\theta_Y)\n$$\nThis fundamental relation is known as Young's equation. It defines the equilibrium contact angle on an ideal solid surface (perfectly smooth, rigid, and chemically homogeneous). Rearranging this equation allows for the determination of $\\theta_Y$:\n$$\n\\cos(\\theta_Y) = \\frac{\\gamma_{sv} - \\gamma_{sl}}{\\gamma_{lv}}\n$$\nThus, the Young's contact angle is given by:\n$$\n\\theta_Y = \\arccos\\left(\\frac{\\gamma_{sv} - \\gamma_{sl}}{\\gamma_{lv}}\\right)\n$$\nThe problem provides the nominal values $\\gamma_{lv} = 72\\ \\mathrm{mN/m}$ and the difference $\\gamma_{sv} - \\gamma_{sl} = 20\\ \\mathrm{mN/m}$.

It is well-posed, providing sufficient, consistent, and physically realistic parameters to determine a unique solution. The language is objective and precise. The problem does not violate any of the invalidity criteria. The model, which neglects line tension and assumes a quasi-static process, is a standard and appropriate simplification for a macroscopic droplet. The use of a shape factor $k$ is a common method to generalize the geometry of the contact line, making the problem self-contained and solvable without requiring a complex calculation of the droplet footprint's exact shape.\n\nStep 3: Verdict\nThe problem is valid. A solution will be derived.\n\nThe derivation proceeds from first principles, namely the balance of forces acting on the droplet in a quasi-static condition. Consider a coordinate system where the $x$-axis is aligned with the solid surface pointing downhill, and the $y$-axis is normal to the surface. The droplet is on the verge of sliding when the driving force due to gravity is exactly balanced by the maximum possible restoring force from capillary action.\n\nThe gravitational force on the droplet is its weight, $F_g = mg$, directed vertically downward. The component of this force parallel to the tilted surface, which acts as the driving force for sliding, is given by:\n$$F_{g, \\parallel} = mg \\sin\\alpha$$\n\nThe capillary force, which opposes the motion, arises from the tension at the three-phase contact line. The problem specifies that the component of the surface tension force per unit length in the plane of the solid surface is $\\gamma_{lv}\\cos\\theta$. This force is directed into the liquid, perpendicular to the contact line. Contact angle hysteresis implies that the contact angle is not uniform around the droplet's perimeter. At the point of incipient motion, the contact angle at the entire downhill (advancing) front is the advancing angle, $\\theta_A$, and at the entire uphill (receding) front, it is the receding angle, $\\theta_R$.\n\nThe force per unit length of contact line projected onto an axis perpendicular to the sliding direction is $\\gamma_{lv}\\cos\\theta$. The force at the advancing front creates a restoring force pointing uphill, while the force at the receding front contributes a force pointing downhill. The net retaining force is due to the difference. A standard model for the total maximum capillary retaining force, $F_{c,max}$, which accounts for the geometry of the contact line through a projected width $w$ and a shape factor $k$, is given by the expression:\n$$F_{c,max} = k \\gamma_{lv} w (\\cos\\theta_R - \\cos\\theta_A)$$\nThis expression represents the maximum force that contact line pinning can exert to prevent the droplet from sliding. The term $(\\cos\\theta_R - \\cos\\theta_A)$ is a measure of the hysteresis.\n\nThe critical condition for the onset of sliding occurs at the critical angle $\\alpha_c$, where the driving force equals the maximum retaining force. Applying Newton's second law for the quasi-static limit (zero acceleration):\n$$\\sum F_x = 0$$\n$$F_{g, \\parallel} - F_{c,max} = 0$$\n$$mg \\sin\\alpha_c = k \\gamma_{lv} w (\\cos\\theta_R - \\cos\\theta_A)$$\n\nSolving for $\\sin\\alpha_c$ yields:\n$$\\sin\\alpha_c = \\frac{k \\gamma_{lv} w (\\cos\\theta_R - \\cos\\theta_A)}{mg}$$\n\nTherefore, the analytical expression for the critical angle $\\alpha_c$ is:\n$$\\alpha_c = \\arcsin\\left(\\frac{k \\gamma_{lv} w (\\cos\\theta_R - \\cos\\theta_A)}{mg}\\right)$$\n\nNow, we evaluate this expression using the provided numerical values.

You will critically evaluate procedural steps and identify potential sources of systematic error, honing the skills needed to design robust experiments and interpret data correctly.", "problem": "A sessile droplet of a Newtonian liquid is gently deposited on a nominally flat, rigid, and chemically homogeneous solid in quiescent air. The static Young contact angle is defined by the balance of interfacial tensions at the contact line. At finite heterogeneity and roughness, the contact line pins and the measured apparent contact angle depends on whether the contact line is forced to advance or recede. A common experimental approach to determine the advancing contact angle and the receding contact angle is to increase and then decrease the droplet volume quasi-statically using a syringe needle connected to a micro-syringe pump while imaging the profile.\n\nFrom first principles of capillarity and viscous flow, one expects the following qualitative controls to be relevant: (i) the Laplace pressure jump across the liquid-vapor interface, given by the surface tension times the total curvature; (ii) the capillary number, defined as the viscosity times a characteristic speed divided by the surface tension, which measures the importance of viscous stresses compared to capillary stresses; and (iii) the Bond number, defined as the density difference times gravitational acceleration times a squared lateral length scale divided by surface tension, which measures gravitational deformation relative to surface tension.\n\nWhich of the following statements together most accurately describe a correct volume-addition and volume-removal protocol to determine the advancing contact angle and the receding contact angle on a sessile droplet, and enumerate genuine sources of systematic error that can bias the results if not mitigated? Select all that apply.\n\nA. To determine the advancing contact angle, increase the droplet volume in small increments at a quasi-static rate such that the capillary number is much less than unity until the contact line depins and expands; record the largest stable contact angle immediately prior to observable contact line motion. To determine the receding contact angle, withdraw volume at a quasi-static rate until the contact line contracts; record the smallest stable contact angle immediately prior to contraction. Keep the needle just touching the droplet with minimal immersion, and wait after each increment for the interface to relax to mechanical equilibrium as indicated by a steady profile.\n\nB. Increasing and decreasing the volume as fast as possible suppresses evaporation effects and therefore improves accuracy; fast ramps are preferred because dynamic effects average out and do not bias the advancing and receding angles.\n\nC. Choosing droplet base radii comparable to or larger than the capillary length reduces gravitational flattening bias; therefore larger droplets are preferred to minimize Bond number effects on the measured contact angles.\n\nD. Uncontrolled surface contamination that introduces chemical heterogeneity or nanoscale roughness increases pinning forces spuriously; inadequate cleaning and characterization of the solid can therefore lead to an overestimation of hysteresis even if the intrinsic Young angle is unchanged.\n\nE. Evaporation during the protocol acts as an uncommanded negative volume flux that can bias the receding contact angle to smaller values and the advancing contact angle to larger values if uncorrected; performing measurements in a saturated vapor environment or compensating for evaporation is necessary for accuracy.\n\nF. A slight intentional tilt of the substrate is required so that gravity assists depinning; without tilt the advancing contact angle is undefined. Tilting therefore reduces bias in both advancing and receding angle measurements.\n\nG. Leaving the dispensing needle immersed in the droplet throughout the protocol does not perturb the measured angles because the local contact angle at the solid is set by Young’s law; any curvature perturbation near the needle is decoupled from the contact line.\n\nH. Optical parallax, lens distortion, and baseline identification errors in side-view imaging can systematically bias both advancing and receding contact angles; using telecentric optics, calibrating magnification, aligning the optical axis normal to the substrate, and robust edge and baseline detection reduce such biases.\n\nI. Selecting a flow rate such that the capillary number is of order unity or larger ensures the contact line samples many pinning sites quickly, reducing apparent hysteresis; larger capillary numbers thus improve accuracy of the quasi-static advancing and receding angles.\n\nJ.

It correctly introduces the physical context, including the relevant dimensionless numbers (Capillary number, Bond number) and physical principles (Laplace pressure). The problem is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. It is therefore permissible to proceed with a full analysis of the provided options.\n\nThe task is to identify all statements that accurately describe a correct experimental protocol and genuine sources of systematic error for measuring advancing and receding contact angles.\n\n**Analysis of Option A**\nThis statement describes the quasi-static measurement protocol. The advancing contact angle, $\\theta_A$, is the maximum angle a sessile drop can sustain before the three-phase contact line begins to move outward. The receding contact angle, $\\theta_R$, is the minimum angle before the contact line moves inward. A \"quasi-static\" process is one carried out sufficiently slowly that the system is always near mechanical equilibrium. In fluid dynamics, this corresponds to a very low capillary number, $Ca = \\mu V / \\gamma \\ll 1$, where $\\mu$ is viscosity, $V$ is a characteristic velocity, and $\\gamma$ is surface tension. This ensures that viscous dynamic stresses are negligible compared to capillary stresses. Recording the angle immediately prior to observable contact line motion correctly identifies the stability limits $\\theta_A$ and $\\theta_R$. Minimal immersion of the dispensing needle is critical to avoid distorting the droplet shape and perturbing the internal pressure field. Waiting for relaxation after each volume increment ensures that the measured profile corresponds to a static equilibrium shape, not a transient one. This statement accurately describes the standard, correct methodology.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**Analysis of Option B**\nThis statement claims that fast volume changes are preferable. This is fundamentally incorrect. Fast volume ramps correspond to a high contact line velocity and thus a large capillary number ($Ca$). At finite $Ca$, the measured angle is a *dynamic* contact angle, $\\theta_D$, which deviates significantly from the static advancing/receding angles. For an advancing line, $\\theta_D > \\theta_A$, and for a receding line, $\\theta_D  \\theta_R$. These dynamic effects do not \"average out\"; they introduce a systematic bias that depends on the contact line speed. The purpose of the experiment is to measure the static limits, so the process must be quasi-static ($Ca \\to 0$). While fast ramps might reduce the total experiment time and thus the total evaporative loss, they invalidate the measurement of the static angles.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**Analysis of Option C**\nThis statement claims larger droplets are preferred to minimize Bond number effects. The Bond number, $Bo = \\Delta \\rho g R^2 / \\gamma$, where $R$ is a characteristic lateral size like the base radius, quantifies the effect of gravity relative to surface tension. The capillary length is $l_c = \\sqrt{\\gamma / (\\Delta \\rho g)}$, so $Bo = (R/l_c)^2$. A large Bond number ($Bo \\gg 1$), which occurs for large droplets ($R \\gg l_c$), signifies that gravity dominates, causing significant droplet flattening. This deformation complicates the extraction of the contact angle from the profile, as the profile is no longer a simple spherical cap. To minimize gravitational bias and simplify the analysis, one should use small droplets such that $Bo \\ll 1$ (i.e., $R \\ll l_c$). The statement makes the opposite and incorrect recommendation.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**Analysis of Option D**\nContact angle hysteresis, the difference $\\Delta\\theta = \\theta_A - \\theta_R$, is a direct consequence of physical and chemical heterogeneities on the solid surface. These defects, such as microscopic roughness or patches of contamination, create local energy barriers that \"pin\" the contact line. Stronger or more numerous pinning sites require a larger deformation of the liquid interface (and thus a larger change in contact angle from the equilibrium Young's angle, $\\theta_Y$) to provide the necessary force to overcome the barrier. Therefore, uncontrolled contamination or roughness will increase the pinning forces and lead to a spuriously large measured hysteresis. Inadequate surface cleaning and characterization can thus cause a significant overestimation of the hysteresis that is intrinsic to the intended, clean substrate material.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**Analysis of Option E**\nEvaporation of the liquid constitutes an uncontrolled negative volume flux, $\\dot{V}_{evap}$. This process biases the measurement. During a receding measurement, evaporation adds to the commanded volume withdrawal rate, causing the contact line to recede faster than intended. This dynamic effect leads to a measured angle that is smaller than the true static receding angle $\\theta_R$. During an advancing measurement, evaporation opposes the commanded volume addition. To induce contact line advance, the experimenter might increase the pumping rate to overcome the evaporative loss. This higher effective flow rate can lead to a dynamic overshoot, where the measured angle is larger than the true static advancing angle $\\theta_A$. Thus, evaporation can bias $\\theta_R$ to smaller values and $\\theta_A$ to larger values. To obtain accurate results, it is essential to mitigate evaporation, for example by performing the experiment inside an environmental chamber saturated with the liquid's vapor, or by actively compensating for the evaporative flux.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**Analysis of Option F**\nThis statement is incorrect on multiple counts. The advancing contact angle is a well-defined material property that can be measured on a perfectly horizontal substrate using the volume-addition method, as described in the problem. Tilting the substrate is the basis for an *alternative* measurement technique (the tilting-plate method), where gravity, not volume change, drives the contact line. Introducing a tilt in the volume-addition experiment is a source of error, as it breaks the axial symmetry of the droplet and imposes a gravitational bias on the contact angle, which will then vary around the contact line perimeter. It does not reduce bias; it introduces it.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**Analysis of Option G**\nThis statement claims that an immersed needle does not perturb the measurement. This is false. The needle is a physical object that distorts the droplet's shape. It creates its own meniscus and locally alters the interface curvature. According to the Young-Laplace equation, $\\Delta P = \\gamma (\\kappa_1 + \\kappa_2)$, a change in curvature $\\kappa$ results in a change in the internal pressure $\\Delta P$. This pressure perturbation propagates throughout the entire droplet and alters the force balance at the three-phase contact line on the substrate, thereby systematically affecting the measured contact angle. This effect is a well-known source of systematic error, and careful experimenters go to great lengths to minimize it by using a very thin needle and withdrawing it from the droplet apex before measurement, or by ensuring minimal immersion as stated in option A.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**Analysis of Option H**\nThis statement correctly identifies several key sources of systematic error in the optical measurement of the droplet profile. The contact angle is not measured directly but is extracted from an image of the droplet.\n- **Optical parallax and lens distortion** can warp the image, leading to incorrect angle calculations.\n- **Baseline identification error** (misidentifying the line representing the solid surface) translates directly into an error in the measured angle.\nThe proposed mitigation techniques are standard best practices in quantitative imaging and metrology: using high-quality, corrected optics (like telecentric lenses), performing careful system calibration, ensuring precise alignment of the camera, and employing robust, validated image analysis algorithms for edge and baseline detection.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**Analysis of Option I**\nThis statement proposes using a high capillary number ($Ca \\sim 1$ or larger). As explained in the analysis of option B, this is the opposite of the correct procedure. A high $Ca$ value means the system is dominated by viscous forces and is far from equilibrium. This measures a *dynamic* contact angle, which is a function of velocity, not the desired *quasi-static* advancing or receding angle. The goal is to isolate the effects of static pinning, which requires minimizing dynamic influences by operating in the limit of $Ca \\to 0$. A large $Ca$ does not \"improve accuracy\"; it measures a different physical quantity altogether.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**Analysis of Option J**\nThe surface tension of most liquids is a function of temperature, $\\gamma(T)$. A temperature gradient $\\nabla T$ along the droplet's surface will create a surface tension gradient $\\nabla \\gamma$. This gradient acts as a tangential stress on the interface, driving a fluid flow known as thermocapillary or Marangoni flow. This flow can move the contact line or alter the droplet shape in a way that is unrelated to the controlled volume change, thus introducing a significant bias to the measured contact angles. Therefore, maintaining isothermal conditions for the substrate, droplet, and ambient environment is crucial for an accurate and unbiased measurement.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**Conclusion**\nThe statements that together provide an accurate description of the correct protocol and a valid enumeration of systematic errors are A, D, E, H, and J.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{ADEHJ}$$", "id": "2766985"}]}
