This well-known result from the calculus of variations gives $dA_{cap} = (\\cos\\theta^{*}) \\, dA$.\nThe area of the trapped liquid-vapor interface increases as the contact area expands over the air/vapor regions of the texture. By definition, this change is $dA_{trapped} = (1 - f_{s}) \\, dA$.\nCombining these, the total change in liquid-vapor area is $dA_{LV} = (\\cos\\theta^{*}) \\, dA + (1 - f_{s}) \\, dA$.\n\nSubstituting these differential area changes back into the equilibrium condition $dE = 0$:\n$$\\gamma_{LV} \\left( (\\cos\\theta^{*}) \\, dA + (1 - f_{s}) \\, dA \\right) + \\gamma_{SL} (f_{s} \\, dA) + \\gamma_{SV} (-f_{s} \\, dA) = 0$$\nSince $dA$ is a non-zero differential area, we can divide the entire equation by $dA$:\n$$\\gamma_{LV} (\\cos\\theta^{*} + 1 - f_{s}) + f_{s} (\\gamma_{SL} - \\gamma_{SV}) = 0$$\nRearranging to solve for $\\gamma_{LV} \\cos\\theta^{*}$:\n$$\\gamma_{LV} \\cos\\theta^{*} = - \\gamma_{LV} (1 - f_{s}) - f_{s} (\\gamma_{SL} - \\gamma_{SV})$$\n$$\\gamma_{LV} \\cos\\theta^{*} = f_{s} (\\gamma_{SV} - \\gamma_{SL}) - \\gamma_{LV} (1 - f_{s})$$\nWe are given Young's law for the chemically identical smooth solid: $\\gamma_{SV} - \\gamma_{SL} = \\gamma_{LV} \\cos \\theta_{Y}$. Substituting this into our expression gives:\n$$\\gamma_{LV} \\cos\\theta^{*} = f_{s} (\\gamma_{LV} \\cos \\theta_{Y}) - \\gamma_{LV} (1 - f_{s})$$\nDividing by the liquid-vapor tension $\\gamma_{LV}$ (which is non-zero) yields the final form of the Cassie-Baxter equation:\n$$\\cos\\theta^{*} = f_{s} \\cos \\theta_{Y} - (1 - f_{s})$$\nThis can be rearranged into a more commonly cited form:\n$$\\cos\\theta^{*} = f_{s} (\\cos \\theta_{Y} + 1) - 1$$\nThis completes the derivation of the homogenized force-balance condition.\n\nNext, we must calculate the specific value of $f_{s}$ required to achieve the desired apparent contact angle. We are given $\\theta^{*} = 160^{\\circ}$ and $\\theta_{Y} = 110^{\\circ}$. We rearrange the derived equation to solve for $f_{s}$:\n$$f_{s} = \\frac{\\cos\\theta^{*} + 1}{\\cos \\theta_{Y} + 1}$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$f_{s} = \\frac{\\cos(160^{\\circ}) + 1}{\\cos(110^{\\circ}) + 1}$$\nWe compute the trigonometric values: $\\cos(160^{\\circ}) \\approx -0.9396926$ and $\\cos(110^{\\circ}) \\approx -0.3420201$.\n$$f_{s} = \\frac{-0.9396926 + 1}{-0.3420201 + 1} = \\frac{0.0603074}{0.6579799} \\approx 0.0916552$$\nRounding to four significant figures as instructed, we obtain $f_{s} = 0.09166$.\n\nFinally, we assess the physical plausibility of this result. A value of $f_{s} \\approx 0.092$ signifies that only approximately $9.2\\%$ of the projected area beneath the droplet is in contact with the solid, while the remaining $90.8\\%$ is suspended over air pockets. This is a characteristic feature of superhydrophobic surfaces. To evaluate its feasibility, we consider a simple, idealized microtexture geometry: a square array of cylindrical micropillars. Let the pillar radius be $R$ and the center-to-center spacing (pitch) be $L$. The solid fraction $f_{s}$ for such a geometry is the ratio of the pillar top area to the unit cell area:\n$$f_{s} = \\frac{\\pi R^{2}}{L^{2}}$$\nUsing our calculated value for $f_{s}$:\n$$0.09166 = \\pi \\left(\\frac{R}{L}\\right)^{2}$$\nSolving for the aspect ratio $R/L$:\n$$\\frac{R}{L} = \\sqrt{\\frac{0.09166}{\\pi}} \\approx \\sqrt{0.02917} \\approx 0.1708$$\nThis implies a pitch-to-radius ratio of $L/R \\approx 5.85$, or a pitch-to-diameter ratio of $L/(2R) \\approx 2.93$. This means the center-to-center distance between pillars is roughly three times the pillar diameter. Such geometric parameters are not only plausible but are typical for microfabricated surfaces engineered for superhydrophobicity using techniques like photolithography and etching. Therefore, the calculated value of $f_{s}$ is entirely physically plausible.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.09166}$$", "id": "2797301"}]}
