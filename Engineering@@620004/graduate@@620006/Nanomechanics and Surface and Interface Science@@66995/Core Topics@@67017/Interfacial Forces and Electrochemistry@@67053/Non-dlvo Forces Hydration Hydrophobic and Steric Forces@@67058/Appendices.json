This exercise delves into the fundamental physics of polymer brushes using the foundational Alexander model, where the repulsive pressure arises from a balance between chain stretching elasticity and osmotic repulsion. By deriving the force as a function of separation and temperature, you will gain a quantitative understanding of how solvent quality governs steric stabilization and can lead to a thermally-induced collapse of the brush protection [@problem_id:2781606].", "problem": "Two identical, neutral polymer brushes are end-grafted to two parallel, flat substrates facing each other. Each brush consists of chains of polymerization index $N$ and Kuhn segment length $a$, grafted at areal density $\\sigma$ (number of chains per unit area).

Each brush is composed of chains with polymerization index $N$ and Kuhn length $a$, grafted with an areal density $\\sigma$. When the separation $D$ is less than twice the uncompressed equilibrium height $H_{0}(T)$, the brushes are compressed to a height $h = D/2$.\n\nThe pressure, or normal force per unit area $P(D,T)$, exerted between the substrates is derived from the total free energy of the system per unit area, which we denote as $\\mathcal{F}(D,T)$. The pressure is given by the fundamental thermodynamic relation $P = -\\frac{\\partial \\mathcal{F}}{\\partial D}$, where the negative sign ensures that a repulsive force corresponds to a positive pressure.\n\nThe total free energy per unit area of the system is the sum of the contributions from the two identical, compressed brushes. The number of chains per unit area on one substrate is $\\sigma$. The free energy per chain is given as $F_{\\text{chain}}(h,T)$. Therefore, the total free energy per unit area for the two brushes is:\n$$\n\\mathcal{F}(D,T) = 2\\sigma F_{\\text{chain}}(h=D/2, T)\n$$\nSubstituting the given expression for $F_{\\text{chain}}(h,T)$ and setting $h = D/2$:\n$$\nF_{\\text{chain}}(h=D/2, T) = k_{B}T\\left[\\frac{(D/2)^{2}}{N a^{2}} + \\frac{v(T)\\,N^{2}\\sigma}{D/2}\\right] = k_{B}T\\left[\\frac{D^{2}}{4N a^{2}} + \\frac{2v(T)\\,N^{2}\\sigma}{D}\\right]\n$$\nThe total free energy per unit area is then:\n$$\n\\mathcal{F}(D,T) = 2\\sigma k_{B}T\\left[\\frac{D^{2}}{4N a^{2}} + \\frac{2v(T)\\,N^{2}\\sigma}{D}\\right] = k_{B}T\\left[\\frac{\\sigma D^{2}}{2N a^{2}} + \\frac{4v(T)\\,N^{2}\\sigma^{2}}{D}\\right]\n$$\nNow, we compute the pressure by differentiating $\\mathcal{F}(D,T)$ with respect to $D$ at constant temperature $T$:\n$$\nP(D,T) = -\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial D} \\left( k_{B}T\\left[\\frac{\\sigma D^{2}}{2N a^{2}} + \\frac{4v(T)\\,N^{2}\\sigma^{2}}{D}\\right] \\right)\n$$\n$$\nP(D,T) = -k_{B}T \\left[ \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial D}\\left(\\frac{\\sigma D^{2}}{2N a^{2}}\\right) + \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial D}\\left(\\frac{4v(T)\\,N^{2}\\sigma^{2}}{D}\\right) \\right]\n$$\nThe derivatives of the individual terms are:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial D}\\left(\\frac{\\sigma D^{2}}{2N a^{2}}\\right) = \\frac{2\\sigma D}{2N a^{2}} = \\frac{\\sigma D}{N a^{2}}\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial D}\\left(\\frac{4v(T)\\,N^{2}\\sigma^{2}}{D}\\right) = 4v(T)\\,N^{2}\\sigma^{2} \\left(-\\frac{1}{D^{2}}\\right) = -\\frac{4v(T)\\,N^{2}\\sigma^{2}}{D^{2}}\n$$\nSubstituting these back into the expression for pressure:\n$$\nP(D,T) = -k_{B}T \\left[ \\frac{\\sigma D}{N a^{2}} - \\frac{4v(T)\\,N^{2}\\sigma^{2}}{D^{2}} \\right]\n$$\n$$\nP(D,T) = k_{B}T \\left[ \\frac{4v(T)\\,N^{2}\\sigma^{2}}{D^{2}} - \\frac{\\sigma D}{N a^{2}} \\right]\n$$\nThis expression reveals that the pressure is a sum of two contributions. The first term, proportional to the second virial coefficient $v(T)$, arises from the monomer-monomer interactions (excluded volume) and is repulsive for a good solvent where $v(T)0$. The second term, stemming from the elastic energy of chain stretching, is attractive. This elastic attraction arises because compressing the brush to $h  H_{0}$ reduces the chain stretching, thereby lowering the elastic component of the free energy. For any compression $D  2H_{0}(T)$, the repulsive term dominates, resulting in a net repulsive force, as expected for stable steric repulsion.\n\nFinally, we substitute the given form for the second virial coefficient, $v(T) = c_v\\,a^{3}\\left(1 - \\frac{T_{\\theta}}{T}\\right)$:\n$$\nP(D,T) = k_{B}T \\left[ \\frac{4\\left(c_v a^{3}\\left(1 - \\frac{T_{\\theta}}{T}\\right)\\right)N^{2}\\sigma^{2}}{D^{2}} - \\frac{\\sigma D}{N a^{2}} \\right]\n$$\nThis can be rewritten as the final result requested.\n\nRegarding the behavior as $T \\to T_{\\theta}^{+}$ (approaching the theta temperature from above), the second virial coefficient $v(T)$ approaches zero. In this limit, the excluded volume repulsions between monomers are exactly balanced by their effective attractions, and the chains behave as ideal coils. Looking at the pressure expression:\n$$\n\\lim_{T\\to T_{\\theta}^{+}} P(D,T) = k_{B}T_{\\theta} \\left[ \\frac{4(0)N^{2}\\sigma^{2}}{D^{2}} - \\frac{\\sigma D}{N a^{2}} \\right] = -\\frac{k_{B}T_{\\theta}\\sigma D}{N a^{2}}\n$$\nThe pressure becomes negative, indicating an attractive force between the substrates. The steric stabilization, which relies on the repulsive excluded volume interactions, vanishes completely. The remaining elastic contribution causes the brushes to mediate an attractive force, which would lead to the aggregation of surfaces or particles that were previously stabilized by the brushes in a good solvent. The polymer brush collapses at the theta temperature, losing its ability to function as a steric barrier.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{k_{B}T \\left[ \\frac{4 c_v a^{3} N^{2} \\sigma^{2}}{D^{2}} \\left(1 - \\frac{T_{\\theta}}{T}\\right) - \\frac{\\sigma D}{N a^{2}} \\right]}\n$$", "id": "2781606"}, {"introduction": "At the nanoscale, the continuum assumption for solvents breaks down, and the discrete nature of molecules gives rise to oscillatory solvation forces.

The wavenumber of the pressure oscillation, $k = \\frac{2\\pi}{d}$, must correspond to the wavenumber $k^{\\ast}$ of the dominant structural mode in the confined liquid. This structural wavenumber $k^{\\ast}$ is determined by the principal peak of the liquid's static structure factor, $S(k)$, which occurs at a wavenumber $k_{peak} \\approx k^{\\ast}$.\n\nFor a simple liquid of spherical molecules with effective diameter $a$, this peak occurs at $k_{peak} \\approx \\frac{2\\pi}{a}$. Equating the wavenumbers gives $\\frac{2\\pi}{d} \\approx \\frac{2\\pi}{a}$, which leads to the interpretation that the oscillation period $d$ is approximately the molecular diameter, $d \\approx a$.\n\nSimilarly, for water, the ordering into hydration shells with a characteristic spacing $\\ell$ (roughly the diameter of a water molecule) dictates the fluid structure. Thus, for hydration forces, the oscillation period $d$ corresponds to the hydration layer spacing, $d \\approx \\ell$. In both cases, $d$ is a direct measure of the characteristic length scale of molecular ordering in the confined liquid.\n\nThe final answer requires only the expression for $P(0)$, which is $A\\cos(\\phi)$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A \\cos(\\phi)}$$", "id": "2781591"}, {"introduction": "The long-range hydrophobic force is a defining interaction in aqueous environments, yet its origins are complex and debated.
