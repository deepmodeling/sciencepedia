A solution will be provided.\n\nThe total Gibbs free energy $G$ of a system with two bulk phases, $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$, and an interface $\\sigma$ is an extensive quantity. It can be expressed as a sum over its constituent parts. However, for the purpose of defining surface properties, we consider the total energy $G$ of the entire system. Its differential is given by the fundamental thermodynamic relation:\n$$dG = -S dT + V dP + \\sum_i \\mu_i dn_i + \\gamma dA$$\nwhere $S$ is the total entropy, $T$ is temperature, $V$ is the total volume, $P$ is pressure, $\\mu_i$ is the chemical potential of component $i$, $n_i$ is the total number of moles of component $i$, $\\gamma$ is the interfacial tension, and $A$ is the interfacial area.\n\nBy Euler's theorem for homogeneous functions, the Gibbs free energy is also given by $G = \\sum_i \\mu_i n_i$. The total differential of this expression is:\n$$dG = \\sum_i \\mu_i dn_i + \\sum_i n_i d\\mu_i$$\nEquating the two expressions for $dG$ yields the Gibbs–Duhem equation for the entire system:\n$$-S dT + V dP + \\gamma dA - \\sum_i n_i d\\mu_i = 0$$\n\nTo isolate the properties of the interface, we introduce the concept of the Gibbs dividing surface and surface excess quantities. Any extensive property $X$ of the system can be written as the sum of contributions from the bulk phases and a surface excess term $X^{\\sigma}$:\n$$X = X^{\\alpha} + X^{\\beta} + X^{\\sigma}$$\nFor the number of moles of component $i$, we define the surface excess concentration $\\Gamma_i$ such that $n_i^{\\sigma} = A\\Gamma_i$.\nApplying the fundamental relation to the surface phase itself, we note that the surface is a conceptual plane of zero volume, so $V^{\\sigma}=0$. The energy change of the surface is then:\n$$dG^{\\sigma} = -S^{\\sigma} dT + \\gamma dA + \\sum_i \\mu_i dn_i^{\\sigma}$$\nThe surface Gibbs energy $G^{\\sigma}$ is also an extensive property of the surface phase, given by $G^{\\sigma} = \\gamma A + \\sum_i \\mu_i n_i^{\\sigma}$. Its total differential is:\n$$dG^{\\sigma} = \\gamma dA + A d\\gamma + \\sum_i \\mu_i dn_i^{\\sigma} + \\sum_i n_i^{\\sigma} d\\mu_i$$\nEquating the two expressions for $dG^{\\sigma}$:\n$$-S^{\\sigma} dT + \\gamma dA + \\sum_i \\mu_i dn_i^{\\sigma} = \\gamma dA + A d\\gamma + \\sum_i \\mu_i dn_i^{\\sigma} + \\sum_i n_i^{\\sigma} d\\mu_i$$\nSimplifying this equation gives:\n$$-S^{\\sigma} dT = A d\\gamma + \\sum_i n_i^{\\sigma} d\\mu_i$$\nDividing by the area $A$ and defining the surface excess entropy per unit area as $S_s = S^{\\sigma}/A$ and the surface excess concentration as $\\Gamma_i = n_i^{\\sigma}/A$, we arrive at the general form of the Gibbs adsorption equation:\n$$d\\gamma = -S_s dT - \\sum_i \\Gamma_i d\\mu_i$$\nAt constant temperature ($dT=0$), this simplifies to the surface Gibbs–Duhem relation requested:\n$$d\\gamma = -\\sum_i \\Gamma_i d\\mu_i$$\nThis relation links the change in interfacial tension to the surface excesses and chemical potentials of all components.\n\nNext, we specialize to a two-component system: a solvent (component $1$) and a single solute (component $2$). The equation becomes:\n$$d\\gamma = -\\Gamma_1 d\\mu_1 - \\Gamma_2 d\\mu_2$$\nThe surface excesses $\\Gamma_i$ depend on the positioning of the Gibbs dividing surface. We are instructed to make the conventional choice for a dilute solution, which places the dividing surface such that the surface excess of the solvent is zero, i.e., $\\Gamma_1 = 0$. With this choice, the equation reduces significantly. We denote the solute as component $2$, and for simplicity, drop the subscript:\n$$d\\gamma = -\\Gamma d\\mu$$\nThe chemical potential $\\mu$ of a solute in an ideal dilute solution is related to its activity $a$ by the expression:\n$$\\mu = \\mu^{\\circ} + RT \\ln a$$\nwhere $\\mu^{\\circ}$ is the standard state chemical potential, $R$ is the ideal gas constant, and $T$ is the absolute temperature. The differential of $\\mu$ at constant temperature is:\n$$d\\mu = RT \\, d(\\ln a)$$\nSubstituting this into the simplified Gibbs equation:\n$$d\\gamma = -\\Gamma (RT \\, d(\\ln a))$$\nRearranging this to solve for the solute surface excess $\\Gamma$ gives the Gibbs adsorption isotherm in its most common form:\n$$\\Gamma = -\\frac{1}{RT} \\left(\\frac{\\partial\\gamma}{\\partial \\ln a}\\right)_T$$\nThis is the required expression.\n\nNow we proceed to the numerical calculation.

The change in the natural logarithm of activity is $\\Delta \\ln a = \\ln(a_2) - \\ln(a_1) = \\ln(10a_1) - \\ln(a_1) = \\ln(10)$.\n\nWe use the provided approximation for the slope:\n$$\\left(\\frac{\\partial\\gamma}{\\partial \\ln a}\\right)_T \\approx \\frac{\\Delta\\gamma}{\\Delta \\ln a} = \\frac{-0.030 \\text{ J m}^{-2}}{\\ln(10)}$$\nSubstituting this into the expression for $\\Gamma$:\n$$\\Gamma = -\\frac{1}{RT} \\left(\\frac{\\Delta\\gamma}{\\Delta \\ln a}\\right) = -\\frac{1}{(8.314 \\text{ J mol}^{-1} \\text{ K}^{-1}) \\times (300 \\text{ K})} \\left(\\frac{-0.030 \\text{ J m}^{-2}}{\\ln(10)}\\right)$$\nThe double negative signs cancel, as expected for a substance that lowers surface tension ($\\Delta\\gamma < 0$) and accumulates at the surface ($\\Gamma > 0$):\n$$\\Gamma = \\frac{0.030 \\text{ J m}^{-2}}{(8.314 \\times 300) \\text{ J mol}^{-1} \\times \\ln(10)}$$\n$$\\Gamma = \\frac{0.030}{2494.2 \\times 2.302585} \\text{ mol m}^{-2}$$\n$$\\Gamma \\approx \\frac{0.030}{5743.1} \\text{ mol m}^{-2} \\approx 5.2236 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ mol m}^{-2}$$\nRounding to three significant figures, the solute surface excess is:\n$$\\Gamma = 5.22 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ mol m}^{-2}$$\n\nFinally, we assess the physical plausibility of this result by calculating the area per molecule, $A$, at the interface.\n$$A = \\frac{1}{\\Gamma N_A}$$\nwhere $N_A = 6.022 \\times 10^{23} \\text{ mol}^{-1}$.\n$$A = \\frac{1}{(5.22 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ mol m}^{-2}) \\times (6.022 \\times 10^{23} \\text{ mol}^{-1})}$$\n$$A \\approx \\frac{1}{3.143 \\times 10^{18} \\text{ m}^{-2}} \\approx 3.18 \\times 10^{-19} \\text{ m}^2$$\nTo compare this with typical molecular dimensions, we convert this area to square angstroms ($1 \\text{ Å}^2 = 10^{-20} \\text{ m}^2$):\n$$A \\approx 3.18 \\times 10^{-19} \\text{ m}^2 \\times \\left(\\frac{1 \\text{ Å}^2}{10^{-20} \\text{ m}^2}\\right) = 31.8 \\text{ Å}^2$$\nAn area of approximately $32 \\text{ Å}^2$ per molecule is a very reasonable value.

The proposed methodology, based on Tikhonov regularization with a curvature penalty and automated parameter selection via Generalized Cross-Validation (GCV), is a standard and robust approach for such problems.\n\nThe solution proceeds by implementing the prescribed algorithm in a step-by-step manner.\n\n1.  **Fundamental Relation and Transformation**: The core physical principle is the Gibbs adsorption isotherm, which relates the surface excess $\\Gamma$ to the change in surface tension $\\gamma$ with the natural logarithm of activity $a$:\n    $$\n    \\Gamma = -\\frac{1}{R T}\\left(\\frac{\\partial \\gamma}{\\partial \\ln a}\\right)_{T}\n    $$\n    Here, $R$ is the ideal gas constant and $T$ is the absolute temperature. To facilitate numerical computation, we introduce the variable $x = \\ln a$. The problem then reduces to computing the derivative $\\frac{d\\gamma}{dx}$ from a set of discrete, noisy data points $(x_i, \\gamma_i)$, where $x_i = \\ln a_i$.\n\n2.  **Regularized Smoothing (Tikhonov Regularization)**: Direct numerical differentiation of the raw data $\\{\\gamma_i\\}$ would unacceptably amplify the experimental noise. To obtain a stable estimate of the derivative, we first compute a smoothed version of the surface tension profile, denoted $\\tilde{\\gamma}$, by solving a regularized least-squares problem. The objective is to find a vector $\\tilde{\\gamma} \\in \\mathbb{R}^n$ that balances fidelity to the measured data (the first term) with a penalty on the roughness of the solution (the second term):\n    $$\n    \\min_{\\tilde{\\gamma}\\in\\mathbb{R}^n}\\ \\|\\tilde{\\gamma}-\\gamma\\|_2^2+\\lambda\\|L\\tilde{\\gamma}\\|_2^2\n    $$\n    Here, $\\|\\cdot\\|_2$ is the Euclidean norm, $\\lambda \\ge 0$ is the regularization parameter that controls the trade-off between data fidelity and smoothness, and $L$ is a matrix that approximates the second derivative operator. Minimizing $\\|L\\tilde{\\gamma}\\|_2^2$ forces the smoothed curve to be \"as straight as possible\", thereby reducing spurious oscillations caused by noise.\n\n3.  **Discrete Second-Derivative Operator ($L$)**: The matrix $L \\in \\mathbb{R}^{(n-2)\\times n}$ is constructed to approximate the second derivative on the non-uniform grid $\\{x_i\\}$. For each interior point $x_i$ ($i \\in \\{1, \\dots, n-2\\}$, using $0$-based indexing), a three-point finite-difference formula is used. Let $h_0 = x_i - x_{i-1}$ and $h_1 = x_{i+1} - x_i$. The row of $L$ corresponding to the second derivative at point $x_i$ contains three non-zero elements corresponding to points $x_{i-1}$, $x_i$, and $x_{i+1}$ (columns $i-1$, $i$, $i+1$ of $L$):\n    - At column $i-1$: $w_{i-1} = \\dfrac{2}{h_0(h_0+h_1)}$\n    - At column $i$: $w_{i} = -\\dfrac{2}{h_0 h_1}$\n    - At column $i+1$: $w_{i+1} = \\dfrac{2}{h_1(h_0+h_1)}$\n    This yields a banded matrix $L$.\n\n4.  **Solving for the Smoothed Profile**: The Tikhonov minimization problem is a linear least-squares problem with a closed-form solution. Setting the gradient of the objective function with respect to $\\tilde{\\gamma}$ to zero yields the normal equations: $(I + \\lambda L^{\\mathsf{T}}L)\\tilde{\\gamma} = \\gamma$. The smoothed profile is thus given by:\n    $$\n    \\tilde{\\gamma}(\\lambda) = (I + \\lambda L^{\\mathsf{T}}L)^{-1}\\gamma\n    $$\n    where $I$ is the $n \\times n$ identity matrix.\n\n5.  **Optimal Regularization Parameter ($\\lambda$) via GCV**: The choice of $\\lambda$ is critical. An overly small $\\lambda$ leads to under-smoothing (fitting to noise), while an overly large $\\lambda$ leads to over-smoothing (loss of true features). The Generalized Cross-Validation (GCV) method provides an automatic and objective way to select $\\lambda$ by minimizing the GCV score:\n    $$\n    \\mathrm{GCV}(\\lambda)=\\frac{n\\,\\|\\gamma-\\tilde{\\gamma}(\\lambda)\\|_2^2}{\\left(n-\\mathrm{tr}(H(\\lambda))\\right)^2}\n    $$\n    where $H(\\lambda) = (I + \\lambda L^{\\mathsf{T}}L)^{-1}$ is the \"hat\" matrix that maps the observed data $\\gamma$ to the smoothed data $\\tilde{\\gamma}$. The term $\\mathrm{tr}(H(\\lambda))$ represents the effective number of parameters in the smoothed model. The GCV function is minimized over a wide logarithmic range of $\\lambda$ values (e.g., $\\lambda \\in [10^{-12}, 10^{12}]$) using a standard one-dimensional optimization algorithm. For numerical stability, the trace of $H(\\lambda)$ is computed using the eigenvalues $s_j$ of the matrix $K=L^{\\mathsf{T}}L$ as $\\mathrm{tr}(H(\\lambda)) = \\sum_{j=1}^n (1+\\lambda s_j)^{-1}$.\n\n6.  **Numerical Differentiation of the Smoothed Profile**: Once the optimal $\\lambda$ is found and the smoothed profile $\\tilde{\\gamma}$ is computed, its derivative, $\\frac{d\\gamma}{dx}$, is estimated at each node $x_i$.\n    - For interior nodes $i \\in \\{1, \\dots, n-2\\}$: A central-difference formula for non-uniform grids is used:\n    $$\n    \\left(\\frac{d\\gamma}{dx}\\right)_i = \\tilde{\\gamma}_{i-1} \\frac{-h_1}{h_0(h_0+h_1)} + \\tilde{\\gamma}_i \\frac{h_1-h_0}{h_0 h_1} + \\tilde{\\gamma}_{i+1} \\frac{h_0}{h_1(h_0+h_1)}\n    $$\n    where $h_0=x_i-x_{i-1}$ and $h_1=x_{i+1}-x_i$.\n    - For boundary nodes $i=0$ and $i=n-1$: Lower-order, one-sided forward and backward difference formulas are applied:\n    $$\n    \\left(\\frac{d\\gamma}{dx}\\right)_0 = \\frac{\\tilde{\\gamma}_1 - \\tilde{\\gamma}_0}{x_1 - x_0} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\left(\\frac{d\\gamma}{dx}\\right)_{n-1} = \\frac{\\tilde{\\gamma}_{n-1} - \\tilde{\\gamma}_{n-2}}{x_{n-1} - x_{n-2}}\n    $$\n\n7.  **Interpolation and Final Calculation**: The derivative values $\\frac{d\\gamma}{dx}$ are known at the grid points $\\{x_i\\}$. To find the derivative at the specified query activities $\\{a_{\\mathrm{query}}\\}$, we first compute the corresponding logarithmic coordinates $\\{x_{\\mathrm{query}} = \\ln a_{\\mathrm{query}}\\}$. We then use linear interpolation on the discrete data $(x_i, (\\frac{d\\gamma}{dx})_i)$ to find the derivative values at the query points $x_{\\mathrm{query}}$. Finally, the surface excess $\\Gamma$ at each query activity is calculated using the Gibbs isotherm, ensuring all quantities are in SI units:\n    $$\n    \\Gamma(a_{\\mathrm{query}}) = -\\frac{1}{R T} \\left(\\frac{d\\gamma}{dx}\\right)_{x=\\ln a_{\\mathrm{query}}}\n    $$\n    The resulting values are then rounded to six significant digits as required.", "answer": "```python\n# The complete and runnable Python 3 code goes here.\n# Imports must adhere to the specified execution environment.\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy.optimize import minimize_scalar\nfrom math import log10, floor, fabs\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Main function to solve the problem for all test cases.\n    \"\"\"\n    R_GAS_CONSTANT = 8.314462618  # J / (mol*K)\n\n    test_cases = [\n        {\n            \"a\": [1.0e-6, 1.778e-6, 3.162e-6, 5.623e-6, 1.0e-5, 1.778e-5, 3.162e-5, 5.623e-5, 1.0e-4, 1.778e-4, 3.162e-4, 5.623e-4, 1.0e-3, 1.778e-3, 3.162e-3, 5.623e-3, 1.0e-2],\n            \"gamma\": [7.190e-2, 7.165e-2, 7.120e-2, 7.080e-2, 7.020e-2, 6.910e-2, 6.750e-2, 6.580e-2, 6.320e-2, 6.010e-2, 5.680e-2, 5.300e-2, 4.750e-2, 4.120e-2, 3.580e-2, 3.110e-2, 2.700e-2],\n            \"T\": 298.0,\n            \"a_query\": [1.0e-5, 1.0e-4, 1.0e-3]\n        },\n        {\n            \"a\": [1.0e-6, 2.0e-6, 5.0e-6, 1.0e-5, 2.0e-5, 5.0e-5, 1.0e-4, 3.0e-4, 1.0e-3],\n            \"gamma\": [7.200e-2, 7.170e-2, 7.120e-2, 7.050e-2, 6.930e-2, 6.680e-2, 6.350e-2, 5.800e-2, 5.200e-2],\n            \"T\": 298.0,\n            \"a_query\": [1.0e-5, 1.0e-4, 1.0e-3]\n        },\n        {\n            \"a\": [1.0e-6, 1.778e-6, 3.162e-6, 5.623e-6, 1.0e-5, 1.778e-5, 3.162e-5, 5.623e-5, 1.0e-4, 1.778e-4, 3.162e-4, 5.623e-4, 1.0e-3, 1.778e-3, 3.162e-3, 5.623e-3, 1.0e-2],\n            \"gamma\": [7.220e-2, 7.200e-2, 7.170e-2, 7.145e-2, 7.070e-2, 6.990e-2, 6.780e-2, 6.620e-2, 6.310e-2, 6.050e-2, 5.780e-2, 5.440e-2, 4.910e-2, 4.350e-2, 3.840e-2, 3.410e-2, 3.020e-2],\n            \"T\": 298.0,\n            \"a_query\": [1.0e-5, 1.0e-4, 1.0e-3]\n        }\n    ]\n\n    def round_to_significant_figures(value, sig_figs):\n        \"\"\"Rounds a number to a specified number of significant figures.\"\"\"\n        if value == 0:\n            return 0.0\n        return round(value, sig_figs - int(floor(log10(fabs(value)))) - 1)\n\n    def process_case(case_data):\n        \"\"\"\n        Processes a single test case to calculate surface excess Gamma.\n        \"\"\"\n        a = np.array(case_data[\"a\"])\n        gamma = np.array(case_data[\"gamma\"])\n        temp = case_data[\"T\"]\n        a_query = np.array(case_data[\"a_query\"])\n        \n        n = len(a)\n        x = np.log(a)\n        I = np.identity(n)\n\n        # 1.
