The derivation must start from two fundamental premises: Young's equation and a geometric-mean combining rule for interfacial interactions.\n\nFirst, we state the given principles. Young's equation relates the surface free energies at the three-phase contact line of a liquid drop on a solid surface in a vapor environment (conventionally, $\\gamma_{SV} = \\gamma_S$ for a solid in equilibrium with the liquid's vapor):\n$$\n\\gamma_S = \\gamma_{SL} + \\gamma_L \\cos\\theta\n$$\nHere, $\\gamma_S$ is the solid-vapor surface free energy, $\\gamma_L$ is the liquid-vapor surface tension, $\\gamma_{SL}$ is the solid-liquid interfacial energy, and $\\theta$ is the static contact angle.\n\nThe second principle is the geometric-mean combining rule for the work of adhesion, $W_A$, between the solid and liquid. The total work of adhesion is the sum of dispersive and polar contributions, $W_A = W_A^{\\mathrm{d}} + W_A^{\\mathrm{p}}$. The geometric mean rule states:\n$$\nW_A^{\\mathrm{d}} = 2\\sqrt{\\gamma_S^{\\mathrm{d}}\\gamma_L^{\\mathrm{d}}}\n$$\n$$\nW_A^{\\mathrm{p}} = 2\\sqrt{\\gamma_S^{\\mathrm{p}}\\gamma_L^{\\mathrm{p}}}\n$$\nThe total work of adhesion is therefore:\n$$\nW_A = 2\\sqrt{\\gamma_S^{\\mathrm{d}}\\gamma_L^{\\mathrm{d}}} + 2\\sqrt{\\gamma_S^{\\mathrm{p}}\\gamma_L^{\\mathrm{p}}}\n$$\nThe work of adhesion is related to the interfacial energy $\\gamma_{SL}$ through the Dupré equation:\n$$\nW_A = \\gamma_S + \\gamma_L - \\gamma_{SL}\n$$\nCombining the Dupré equation with Young's equation gives the Young-Dupré equation:\n$$\nW_A = \\gamma_L(1+\\cos\\theta)\n$$\nTherefore, we can equate the two expressions for the work of adhesion $W_A$:\n$$\n\\gamma_L(1+\\cos\\theta) = 2\\sqrt{\\gamma_S^{\\mathrm{d}}\\gamma_L^{\\mathrm{d}}} + 2\\sqrt{\\gamma_S^{\\mathrm{p}}\\gamma_L^{\\mathrm{p}}}\n$$\nThis is the Owens-Wendt-Rabel-Kaelble (OWRK) equation. To determine the two unknowns, $\\sqrt{\\gamma_S^{\\mathrm{d}}}$ and $\\sqrt{\\gamma_S^{\\mathrm{p}}}$, we must linearize this equation into the form $y = mx + b$.

With the data above, $\\gamma_S^{\\mathrm{d}} \\approx 30\\,\\mathrm{mN\\,m^{-1}}$ and $\\gamma_S^{\\mathrm{p}} \\approx 10\\,\\mathrm{mN\\,m^{-1}}$.\nThis option perfectly matches our derived linear scheme, the identification of coefficients, and the calculated numerical results.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\nB. Plot $y = \\gamma_L\\cos\\theta$ versus $x = \\sqrt{\\gamma_L^{\\mathrm{p}}}$. The linear fit $y = mx + b$ yields $m = 2\\sqrt{\\gamma_S^{\\mathrm{p}}}$ and $b = 2\\sqrt{\\gamma_S^{\\mathrm{d}}}$.\nTo test this, we rearrange the OWRK equation: $\\gamma_L \\cos\\theta = 2\\sqrt{\\gamma_S^{\\mathrm{d}}\\gamma_L^{\\mathrm{d}}} + 2\\sqrt{\\gamma_S^{\\mathrm{p}}\\gamma_L^{\\mathrm{p}}} - \\gamma_L$.

The \"intercept\" term, $2\\sqrt{\\gamma_S^{\\mathrm{d}}\\gamma_L^{\\mathrm{d}}} - \\gamma_L$, is not a constant; it depends on the properties of each probe liquid ($\\gamma_L$ and $\\gamma_L^{\\mathrm{d}}$). Therefore, this plotting scheme does not produce a linear relationship. The proposed method is invalid.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\nC. Plot $y = \\dfrac{\\gamma_L\\left(1+\\cos\\theta\\right)}{2\\,\\gamma_L^{\\mathrm{d}}}$ versus $x = \\dfrac{\\gamma_L^{\\mathrm{p}}}{\\gamma_L^{\\mathrm{d}}}$. The linear fit $y = mx + b$ yields $m = \\gamma_S^{\\mathrm{p}}$ and $b = \\gamma_S^{\\mathrm{d}}$.\nThis is an incorrect linearization. It appears to be an attempt to relate the square of the variables from the correct plot in option A. Dividing the OWRK equation by $2\\gamma_L^d$ yields $\\frac{\\gamma_L(1+\\cos\\theta)}{2\\gamma_L^{\\mathrm{d}}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{\\gamma_S^{\\mathrm{d}}}}{\\sqrt{\\gamma_L^{\\mathrm{d}}}} + \\sqrt{\\gamma_S^{\\mathrm{p}}}\\frac{\\sqrt{\\gamma_L^{\\mathrm{p}}}}{\\gamma_L^{\\mathrm{d}}}$. This is not a linear function of $x = \\dfrac{\\gamma_L^{\\mathrm{p}}}{\\gamma_L^{\\mathrm{d}}}$ with constant coefficients. The proposed mapping of slope and intercept to $\\gamma_S^{\\mathrm{p}}$ and $\\gamma_S^{\\mathrm{d}}$ is baseless.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\nD. Use only the apolar liquid to determine both components via $\\gamma_S^{\\mathrm{d}} = \\gamma_L\\cos\\theta$ and set $\\gamma_S^{\\mathrm{p}} = 0$. With diiodomethane, $\\gamma_S^{\\mathrm{d}} \\approx 28\\,\\mathrm{mN\\,m^{-1}}$ and $\\gamma_S^{\\mathrm{p}} \\approx 0\\,\\mathrm{mN\\,m^{-1}}$.\nThis method is flawed for two reasons. First, using only an apolar liquid ($\\gamma_L^{\\mathrm{p}}=0$) can, at best, provide information only about the dispersive component $\\gamma_S^{\\mathrm{d}}$. It gives no information about $\\gamma_S^{\\mathrm{p}}$, which cannot be arbitrarily set to zero. The fact that polar liquids like water and ethylene glycol wet the surface ($\\theta < 90^\\circ$) suggests that $\\gamma_S^{\\mathrm{p}} > 0$. Second, the formula used, $\\gamma_S^{\\mathrm{d}} = \\gamma_L\\cos\\theta$, is not derived from the stated principles. The correct relation for an apolar liquid is $\\gamma_L (1+\\cos\\theta) = 2\\sqrt{\\gamma_S^{\\mathrm{d}}\\gamma_L^{\\mathrm{d}}}$. Using this with the diiodomethane data yields $\\gamma_S^{\\mathrm{d}} = \\gamma_L^{\\mathrm{d}} \\left(\\frac{1+\\cos\\theta}{2}\\right)^2 \\approx 30.1\\,\\mathrm{mN\\,m^{-1}}$, which contradicts the value of $\\sim 28\\,\\mathrm{mN\\,m^{-1}}$ proposed in the option from the incorrect formula.

First Principles**\nThe component-based analysis (vOCG or OWK) aims to solve a system of equations derived from the Young-Dupré equation. For a given probe liquid ($L$), the equation is:\n$$ W_{SL} = \\gamma_{LV} (1 + \\cos \\theta_0) $$\nwhere $W_{SL}$ is the work of adhesion between the solid ($S$) and liquid ($L$), and $\\theta_0$ is the intrinsic Young's contact angle. This angle is valid only for an ideal surface: perfectly smooth, chemically homogeneous, rigid, and inert. The work of adhesion is expressed in terms of surface energy components, for example, using the vOCG framework:\n$$ W_{SL} = 2\\sqrt{\\gamma_S^{\\mathrm{LW}} \\gamma_L^{\\mathrm{LW}}} + 2\\sqrt{\\gamma_S^{+} \\gamma_L^{-}} + 2\\sqrt{\\gamma_S^{-} \\gamma_L^{+}} $$\nCombining these gives the equation to be solved:\n$$ \\gamma_{LV} (1 + \\cos \\theta_0) = 2\\sqrt{\\gamma_S^{\\mathrm{LW}} \\gamma_L^{\\mathrm{LW}}} + 2\\sqrt{\\gamma_S^{+} \\gamma_L^{-}} + 2\\sqrt{\\gamma_S^{-} \\gamma_L^{+}} $$\nThe core issue is that the experimental data provide an apparent angle, $\\theta^*$, not the intrinsic angle, $\\theta_0$. The colleague's proposal to substitute $\\theta^*$ for $\\theta_0$ is incorrect because the surface is non-ideal. We must analyze the effects of roughness and heterogeneity.\n\n**2. Effect of Roughness**\nThe surface has nanoscale roughness ($h_{\\mathrm{rms}} = 2.5\\,\\mathrm{nm}$, $a = 30\\,\\mathrm{nm}$) and a roughness factor $r = 1.20$. The macroscopic droplet ($R \\approx 1\\,\\mathrm{mm}$) averages over this texture, as $a \\ll R$. We must consider two primary wetting states on a rough surface:\n-   **Wenzel State:** The liquid completely penetrates the roughness grooves. The apparent angle, $\\theta_W^*$, is given by Wenzel's equation:\n    $$ \\cos \\theta_W^* = r \\cos \\theta_0 $$\n-   **Cassie-Baxter State:** The liquid sits atop the roughness features, trapping vapor pockets. This state is not explicitly suggested by the data; the observed angles ($81^\\circ$, $66^\\circ$) are not in the superhydrophobic regime where this state is most common. The Wenzel state is the default model for a fully wetted rough texture.\n\nAssuming the Wenzel state applies, using the apparent angle $\\theta^* = \\theta_W^*$ directly in the Young-Dupré equation leads to a biased (apparent) work of adhesion, $W_{SL}^*$:\n$$ W_{SL}^* = \\gamma_{LV} (1 + \\cos \\theta_W^*) = \\gamma_{LV} (1 + r \\cos \\theta_0) $$\nThe true work of adhesion is $W_{SL} = \\gamma_{LV} (1 + \\cos \\theta_0)$.\nSince $r = 1.20 > 1$:\n-   If the intrinsic surface is hydrophilic ($\\theta_0 < 90^{\\circ}$, so $\\cos \\theta_0 > 0$), then $r \\cos \\theta_0 > \\cos \\theta_0$, which implies $W_{SL}^* > W_{SL}$. The work of adhesion is overestimated.\n-   If the intrinsic surface is hydrophobic ($\\theta_0 > 90^{\\circ}$, so $\\cos \\theta_0 < 0$), then $r \\cos \\theta_0 < \\cos \\theta_0$, which implies $W_{SL}^* < W_{SL}$. The work of adhesion is underestimated.\nFor the given liquids, $\\theta_W^*$ is acute, so it is almost certain that $\\theta_0$ is also acute. Therefore, direct use of $\\theta^*$ will overestimate $W_{SL}$ and lead to erroneously inflated values for the fitted surface energy components ($\\gamma_{S}^{\\mathrm{LW}}$, $\\gamma_{S}^{+}$, $\\gamma_{S}^{-}$).\n\n**3. Effect of Chemical Heterogeneity**\nThe surface is a composite of polar patches ($f_P = 0.30$) and a nonpolar matrix ($1 - f_P = 0.70$). The patch size is on the scale of the correlation length, $a = 30\\,\\mathrm{nm}$, which is much smaller than the droplet radius $R$. In this limit, the macroscopic contact angle represents an average over the different chemical domains. According to Cassie's law for chemical heterogeneity, the cosine of the effective intrinsic angle, $\\theta_0^{\\mathrm{eff}}$, is the area-weighted average of the cosines of the intrinsic angles on each domain (polar, $P$, and backbone, $B$):\n$$ \\cos \\theta_0^{\\mathrm{eff}} = f_P \\cos \\theta_P + (1 - f_P) \\cos \\theta_B $$\nTherefore, even after correcting for roughness, the resulting angle $\\theta_0$ is an effective angle $\\theta_0^{\\mathrm{eff}}$ that represents the composite surface, not a single homogeneous material. The component analysis will yield *effective* surface energy components for this composite.\n\n**4. Combined Effects and Correction Strategy**\nA proper analysis must sequentially correct for these effects.\n-   First, relate the measured apparent angle $\\theta^*$ to the effective intrinsic angle $\\theta_0^{\\mathrm{eff}}$ using the appropriate roughness model. Given the data, the Wenzel model is the most reasonable starting point.\n    $$ \\cos \\theta_0^{\\mathrm{eff}} = \\frac{\\cos \\theta^*}{r} $$\n-   Second, the presence of significant contact angle hysteresis ($\\Delta \\theta \\approx 12-20^{\\circ}$) indicates that the measured \"static\" angle $\\theta^*$ is not a unique thermodynamic value. Hysteresis arises from the pinning of the contact line on roughness and chemical defects. A robust analysis must account for this by using the advancing ($\\theta_A^*$) and receding ($\\theta_R^*$) angles to bracket the range of possible outcomes. One would compute $\\cos \\theta_{0,A}^{\\mathrm{eff}} = \\cos \\theta_A^*/r$ and $\\cos \\theta_{0,R}^{\\mathrm{eff}} = \\cos \\theta_R^*/r$ and perform the component analysis for both limits to obtain a range (an error bar) for the inferred surface energy components.\n-   The final step is to use the corrected angle, $\\cos \\theta_0^{\\mathrm{eff}}$, in the component analysis equation.\n\nThe correct procedure is therefore: 1. Measure advancing and receding apparent angles. 2. Correct these angles for roughness using the Wenzel equation (assuming a fully wetted state). 3. Use the resulting range of effective intrinsic angles in the vOCG/OWK equations to calculate a range of values for the surface energy components.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n-   **A. Direct use of $\\theta^{*}$ is unbiased because macroscopic angles always average out nanoscale details; no correction is needed.**\n    This is incorrect. The averaging process itself, described by Wenzel's and Cassie's laws, introduces a systematic bias. The apparent angle $\\theta^*$ is not equal to the intrinsic angle $\\theta_0$. Thus, a correction is mandatory. **Incorrect**.\n\n-   **B. On a rough but fully wetted texture, the Wenzel state amplifies $|\\cos \\theta|$ by the roughness factor $r$, so using $\\theta^{*}$ in place of the intrinsic Young angle $\\theta_{0}$ biases the Dupré work of adhesion high when $\\cos \\theta_{0} > 0$ (hydrophilic) and low when $\\cos \\theta_{0} < 0$ (hydrophobic), inflating or deflating the fitted $\\gamma_{S}$ components accordingly. A correction is to determine the wetting state per liquid, use the Wenzel relation to recover $\\cos \\theta_{0} = \\cos \\theta^{*}/r$ when fully wetted ($a \\ll R$ and no trapped vapor), account for chemical heterogeneity by Cassie chemical mixing $\\cos \\theta_{0}^{\\mathrm{eff}} = f_{P} \\cos \\theta_{P} + (1 - f_{P}) \\cos \\theta_{B}$ at submicrometric patch sizes, and then perform the component analysis with the corrected intrinsic angle(s), propagating bounds from advancing–receding bracketing.**\n    This option is comprehensive and physically sound. It correctly identifies the Wenzel state for a \"fully wetted texture\" and the direction of the bias on the work of adhesion. It proposes the correct Wenzel correction ($\\cos \\theta_0 = \\cos \\theta^*/r$) under the appropriate physical conditions ($a \\ll R$, no trapped vapor). It correctly notes that the resulting intrinsic angle is an effective one due to chemical heterogeneity, governed by Cassie's mixing rule. Finally, it correctly advocates for propagating uncertainty by using advancing and receding angles to handle the observed hysteresis. This entire pipeline is a textbook example of a rigorous analysis. **Correct**.\n\n-   **C. Roughness only alters the solid–vapor surface free energy and leaves the Dupré work $W_{SL}$ invariant, so using $\\theta^{*}$ directly yields correct $\\gamma_{S}$ components; heterogeneity is irrelevant at macroscopic scales.**\n    This is incorrect. Roughness increases the area of both the solid-vapor and solid-liquid interfaces. Wenzel's equation, $\\cos \\theta_W^* = r \\cos \\theta_0$, demonstrates that the apparent angle is modified, which directly alters the calculation of the work of adhesion if $\\theta^*$ is used. $W_{SL}$ is thus not invariant to the choice of angle. Heterogeneity is also not irrelevant; its effect is averaged by the macroscopic droplet according to Cassie's Law, which must be accounted for. **Incorrect**.\n\n-   **D. The cleanest fix is to switch to nanodroplets with $R \\sim a$ so each droplet probes a single domain, measure $\\theta^{*}$ there, and treat those measurements as intrinsic for component analysis; line tension and pinning at that scale are negligible.**\n    This is incorrect. While probing a single domain is an interesting experimental idea, the assumption that line tension and pinning are negligible at the nanoscale ($R \\sim a \\sim 30\\,\\mathrm{nm}$) is fundamentally wrong. Line tension effects scale as $1/R$ and become dominant for nanodroplets. Similarly, pinning effects at the boundaries of chemical domains or at individual roughness features would be extremely strong for a droplet of comparable size, making it impossible to measure a meaningful thermodynamic contact angle. This \"fix\" introduces more severe and less tractable complications. **Incorrect**.\n\n-   **E. Because the surface is rough, the correct model is a Cassie–Baxter composite state with trapped vapor, so one should apply a vapor-fraction correction using a solid fraction estimated from AFM topography to back out $\\theta_{0}$ before component analysis; advancing–receding averaging is unnecessary.**\n    This is incorrect. It makes two flawed assertions. First, it dogmatically assumes a Cassie-Baxter state without justification; the Wenzel state is equally, if not more, plausible for the given angles. The wetting state must be determined, not assumed. Second, and more critically, it claims that accounting for hysteresis (\"advancing–receding averaging\") is \"unnecessary.\" The large measured hysteresis ($\\Delta \\theta \\approx 12-20^{\\circ}$) is a dominant experimental feature indicating significant energy barriers. Ignoring it constitutes a scientifically invalid simplification and discards crucial information about the system's energetics and the uncertainty of the measurement. **Incorrect**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2791738"}]}
