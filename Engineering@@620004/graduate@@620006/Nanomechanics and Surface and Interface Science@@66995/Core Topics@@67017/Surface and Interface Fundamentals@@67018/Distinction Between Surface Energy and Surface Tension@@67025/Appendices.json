It is a well-formulated, self-contained, and scientifically grounded question that tests a fundamental concept in condensed matter physics. I will proceed with the solution.\n\n### Derivation from First Principles\n\nThe reversible work $\\mathrm{d}W_{rev}$ done on a system at constant temperature $T$ and constant composition ($n_i$) equals the change in its Helmholtz free energy, $F$.\nFor a system with a surface of area $A$, the differential of the Helmholtz free energy is:\n$$ \\mathrm{d}F = -S\\,\\mathrm{d}T - P\\,\\mathrm{d}V + \\sum_i \\mu_i\\,\\mathrm{d}n_i + \\mathrm{d}F_{surf} $$\nwhere $\\mathrm{d}F_{surf}$ is the change in free energy due to the change in the surface. At constant $T$, $V$, and $n_i$, we have $\\mathrm{d}F = \\mathrm{d}F_{surf}$.\n\nThe surface free energy, $\\gamma$, is defined as the reversible work required to create a unit area of new surface. Thermodynamically, it is the excess free energy per unit area: $\\gamma = (\\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial A})_{T, V, n_i}$. Thus, the work done to create a new surface area $\\mathrm{d}A$ is $\\mathrm{d}W_{rev} = \\gamma \\mathrm{d}A$.\n\nNow consider the work done by elastically deforming an existing surface. This work is given in terms of the surface stress tensor $\\tau_{ij}$ and the infinitesimal strain tensor $\\mathrm{d}\\varepsilon_{ij}$:\n$$ \\mathrm{d}W_{rev} = A \\sum_{i,j} \\tau_{ij} \\mathrm{d}\\varepsilon_{ij} $$\nwhere $A$ is the area of the surface.\n\nThe total Helmholtz free energy of the surface is $F_{surf} = \\gamma A$. Its differential is $\\mathrm{d}F_{surf} = \\mathrm{d}(\\gamma A) = \\gamma \\mathrm{d}A + A \\mathrm{d}\\gamma$.\nThe change in area under strain is $\\mathrm{d}A = A \\sum_i \\mathrm{d}\\varepsilon_{ii} = A \\cdot \\mathrm{Tr}(\\mathrm{d}\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon})$.\nEquating the work done to the change in free energy, $\\mathrm{d}W_{rev} = \\mathrm{d}F_{surf}$, gives:\n$$ A \\sum_{i,j} \\tau_{ij} \\mathrm{d}\\varepsilon_{ij} = \\gamma (A \\sum_i \\mathrm{d}\\varepsilon_{ii}) + A \\sum_{i,j} \\frac{\\partial \\gamma}{\\partial \\varepsilon_{ij}} \\mathrm{d}\\varepsilon_{ij} $$\nThis must hold for any arbitrary strain $\\mathrm{d}\\varepsilon_{ij}$, leading to the Shuttleworth equation:\n$$ \\tau_{ij} = \\gamma \\delta_{ij} + \\frac{\\partial \\gamma}{\\partial \\varepsilon_{ij}} $$\nwhere $\\delta_{ij}$ is the Kronecker delta.\n\n**System (i): Soap Film (Liquid)**\nA liquid is a fluid. When its surface area is increased, molecules from the bulk readily move to the surface to form a \"new\" surface that is structurally identical to the old one. This is a process of creation of new surface, not elastic stretching of a fixed structure. Therefore, the surface energy per unit area, $\\gamma$, is independent of the strain, i.e., $\\frac{\\partial \\gamma}{\\partial \\varepsilon_{ij}} = 0$.\nThe Shuttleworth equation simplifies to $\\tau_{ij} = \\gamma \\delta_{ij}$. The surface stress is isotropic (a scalar multiple of the identity tensor) and is numerically equal to the surface free energy. This quantity $\\gamma$ is what is called surface tension for a liquid.\nIn the proposed experiment, a force $F$ is applied to the movable wire of length $L$ to extend it by $\\mathrm{d}x$. The soap film has two surfaces (front and back). The total increase in surface area is $\\mathrm{d}A = 2L\\,\\mathrm{d}x$. The work done is $\\mathrm{d}W_{rev} = F\\,\\mathrm{d}x$.\nThe change in Helmholtz free energy is $\\mathrm{d}F = \\gamma \\mathrm{d}A = \\gamma (2L\\,\\mathrm{d}x)$.\nEquating work and energy change: $F\\,\\mathrm{d}x = \\gamma (2L\\,\\mathrm{d}x)$, which yields $\\gamma = \\frac{F}{2L}$.\nThe measured quantity is the force per unit length on the double-sided film, $F/(2L)$, which is precisely the surface tension $\\gamma$.\n\n**System (ii): Gold Crystal (Solid)**\nA solid has a crystalline lattice. When the surface is deformed, atoms are displaced from their equilibrium lattice positions, but they do not migrate from the bulk. This is a process of elastic strain. The bonding energy between surface atoms changes with their separation, so the surface free energy $\\gamma$ is a function of the strain $\\varepsilon_{ij}$. Consequently, the term $\\frac{\\partial \\gamma}{\\partial \\varepsilon_{ij}}$ is generally non-zero.\nTherefore, for a solid, the surface stress $\\tau_{ij}$ is not equal to $\\gamma \\delta_{ij}$.\nAn experiment that elastically deforms the surface, such as bending a cantilever, measures the mechanical response to that deformation. This response is governed by the surface stress $\\tau_{ij}$. For instance, the change in bending moment of a cantilever is directly related to the difference in surface stress between the top and bottom surfaces. The measured quantity, a force per unit length response to an elastic strain, is the surface stress $\\tau_{ij}$, not the scalar surface free energy $\\gamma$.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A.

The measurable quantity... is the line force per unit length...**\n- Analysis of (i): The protocol described is correct. Pulling the wire of length $L$ against the film's tension is the standard method. The work done is $F\\,\\mathrm{d}x$ for a displacement $\\mathrm{d}x$. The statement `$\\mathrm{d}A=2L\\,\\mathrm{d}x$` correctly accounts for the total change in surface area on both sides of the film. The force per unit length, $F/(2L)$, is correctly identified as the surface tension $\\gamma$. This is physically sound.\n- Analysis of (ii): The protocol of imposing a small, reversible elastic strain is the correct way to probe the mechanical properties of a solid surface without creating new material (as in cleavage). The quantity conjugate to strain is stress. Thus, the measured \"line force per unit length\" is correctly identified as the surface stress tensor $\\tau_{ij}$. The statement that $\\tau_{ij}$ generally differs from $\\gamma$ due to the strain dependence of $\\gamma$ is the crucial physical point, captured by the Shuttleworth equation.\n- Conclusion: This option correctly describes the physics for both systems and correctly identifies the distinction between the measured quantities.\n\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. (i) Soap film: ...identify the resulting pressure drop $\\Delta p$ across the film as the surface tension. (ii) Gold crystal: Cleave the crystal... identify the measured load per unit width at the crack tip as the surface energy.**\n- Analysis of (i): Incorrect. The pressure drop is related to surface tension via the Young-Laplace equation, $\\Delta p = \\gamma (1/R_1 + 1/R_2)$, where $R_1, R_2$ are the principal radii of curvature. $\\Delta p$ is not equal to $\\gamma$. They do not even have the same physical units; pressure is force/area, while surface tension is force/length.\n- Analysis of (ii): Incorrect. The problem asks for a measurable quantity that is *not* equal to the surface energy. Cleavage experiments, based on Griffith theory, are designed to measure the energy required to create new surfaces, which is directly related to the surface free energy $2\\gamma$. This contradicts the problem's requirement.\n\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. (i) Soap film: ...take $F/L$ as the surface tension. (ii) Gold crystal: ...identify the curvature-derived line force per unit length as the surface free energy.**\n- Analysis of (i): Incorrect. For a soap film with two surfaces supported by a wire of length $L$, the force is $F = 2\\gamma L$. Therefore, the surface tension is $\\gamma = F/(2L)$, not $F/L$. The factor of $2$ is missing.\n- Analysis of (ii): Incorrect. As established, bending a crystal induces elastic strain, and the resulting mechanical response (a \"curvature-derived line force\") is the surface stress $\\tau_{ij}$, not the surface free energy $\\gamma$.\n\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. (i) Soap film: Keep area fixed while adding surfactant... (ii) Gold crystal: Stretch the surface elastically and identify the line force per unit length as the surface stress, which is equal to the surface free energy of the solid.**\n- Analysis of (i): Incorrect. The problem statement explicitly demands a \"protocol to increase the interfacial area\" and identification of the \"mechanical quantity ... conjugate to the imposed displacement.\" This option proposes a chemical protocol at fixed area, which does not follow the instructions.\n- Analysis of (ii): Fundamentally incorrect. It correctly identifies the measured quantity as surface stress but then makes the false claim that surface stress is equal to surface free energy for a solid.

Therefore, we will proceed with the derivation.\n\nThe fundamental principle stated is that the incremental reversible mechanical work, $dW_{\\text{rev}}$, equals the change in the total surface Helmholtz free energy, $dF_s$, under isothermal conditions. The total surface free energy is defined as $F_s = \\int_S \\gamma \\, dA$, where $\\gamma$ is the surface free energy density and the integral is over the current, deformed surface area $S$.\n\nTo properly account for the change in area during deformation, we must relate the current area element, $dA$, to the reference (undeformed) area element, $dA_0$. For small in-plane strains, the relationship is given by $dA = (1 + \\epsilon_{kk}^{s}) dA_0$, where $\\epsilon_{kk}^{s}$ is the trace of the surface strain tensor $\\epsilon_{ij}^{s}$.

The surface free energy per unit reference area, $f_s = F_s / A_0$, is then:\n$$f_s = \\gamma(\\epsilon_{kk}^{s}) (1 + \\epsilon_{kk}^{s})$$\n\nFirst, we analyze the \"true\" case where $\\gamma(\\epsilon_{kk}^{s}) = \\gamma_0 + \\chi \\epsilon_{kk}^{s}$. Substituting this into the expression for $f_s$:\n$$f_s = (\\gamma_0 + \\chi \\epsilon_{kk}^{s})(1 + \\epsilon_{kk}^{s}) = \\gamma_0 + (\\gamma_0 + \\chi)\\epsilon_{kk}^{s} + \\chi(\\epsilon_{kk}^{s})^{2}$$\n\nThe incremental change in free energy per unit reference area, $df_s$, is found by taking the total differential of $f_s$ with respect to the strain trace $\\epsilon_{kk}^{s}$:\n$$df_s = \\frac{df_s}{d\\epsilon_{kk}^{s}} d\\epsilon_{kk}^{s} = \\left[ (\\gamma_0 + \\chi) + 2\\chi\\epsilon_{kk}^{s} \\right] d\\epsilon_{kk}^{s}$$\n\nThe problem specifies an infinitesimal strain increment imposed on an initially unstrained surface.

The problem asks for the work per unit *current* area, $\\delta w$. Since the initial state is unstrained, the current area is equal to the reference area, $A=A_0$.

The problem is found to be scientifically grounded in the principles of continuum mechanics and surface science, is well-posed, and contains all necessary information for a rigorous solution. No inconsistencies or invalid premises are identified. We may therefore proceed.\n\nThe phenomenon described is the deformation of a soft elastic substrate near a contact line, which results from a balance between forces originating from surface stress and the bulk elasticity of the solid. The problem asks for the characteristic length scale, $L$, that demarcates the regimes where one of these effects dominates the other. This is achieved by comparing the magnitudes of the stresses produced by each effect.\n\nFirst, consider the stress arising from the surface. The problem states that a curved surface with an isotropic surface stress, $\\Upsilon$, generates a normal traction, which is a pressure (force per unit area), of the order $P_{surf} \\sim \\Upsilon \\kappa$. Here, $\\kappa$ is the mean curvature of the deformed surface. For a deformation profile with a characteristic vertical displacement $u$ over a lateral length scale $\\ell$, the curvature $\\kappa$ scales as the second spatial derivative of the displacement. For small deformations, this is approximately $\\kappa \\sim \\frac{u}{\\ell^2}$. Therefore, the normal traction due to surface stress can be estimated as:\n$$\nP_{surf} \\sim \\Upsilon \\frac{u}{\\ell^2}\n$$\nIt is crucial to recognize that for a solid, the mechanically relevant quantity in a force balance is the surface stress, $\\Upsilon$, and not the surface energy, $\\gamma$, as correctly specified in the problem statement via the Shuttleworth effect.\n\nSecond, consider the stress within the bulk of the elastic material. The material is a linear elastic solid with Young's modulus $E$. The bulk elastic stress, $\\sigma_{bulk}$, is proportional to the strain, $\\varepsilon$. The problem specifies that the strain scales as the ratio of the displacement $u$ to the length scale $\\ell$ over which it varies. Thus, we have $\\varepsilon \\sim u/\\ell$. The constitutive relation for a linear elastic solid is $\\sigma_{bulk} \\sim E \\varepsilon$. Substituting the scaling for strain, we obtain the scaling for the bulk elastic stress:\n$$\n\\sigma_{bulk} \\sim E \\frac{u}{\\ell}\n$$\n\nThe characteristic length scale, which is named the elastocapillary length $L$, is the length $\\ell$ at which these two stresses are of the same order of magnitude. By equating the expressions for $P_{surf}$ and $\\sigma_{bulk}$, we establish the condition for this balance:\n$$\nP_{surf} \\sim \\sigma_{bulk}\n$$\n$$\n\\Upsilon \\frac{u}{\\ell^2} \\sim E \\frac{u}{\\ell}\n$$\nThe displacement amplitude $u$ is present on both sides of the relation and thus cancels, which is expected for a characteristic length that depends only on material properties. We are left with:\n$$\n\\frac{\\Upsilon}{\\ell} \\sim E\n$$\nSolving for the length scale $\\ell$ gives the expression for the elastocapillary length, $L$:\n$$\nL = \\frac{\\Upsilon}{E}\n$$\nThis length $L$ separates two distinct physical regimes. For a deformation occurring over a length scale $\\ell$, the regime where surface stress dominates the substrate's shape is when its contribution to pressure is greater than the restoring elastic stress from the bulk. This occurs when $P_{surf} > \\sigma_{bulk}$, which implies $\\Upsilon u / \\ell^2 > E u / \\ell$. This inequality simplifies to $\\Upsilon / \\ell > E$, or $\\ell  \\Upsilon/E$. Therefore, surface stress effects dominate for length scales smaller than the elastocapillary length, i.e., when $\\ell  L$. Conversely, bulk elasticity dominates for $\\ell > L$.\n\nThe problem then asks for a dimensionless ratio, $\\Lambda$, that quantifies the dominance of surface stress relative to bulk elasticity for a given lateral extent $\\ell$.
