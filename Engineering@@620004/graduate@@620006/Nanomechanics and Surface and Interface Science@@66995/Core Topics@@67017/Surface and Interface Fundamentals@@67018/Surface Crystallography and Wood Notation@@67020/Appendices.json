The problem specifies that this structure can be described by a centered rectangular unit cell with lattice vectors $\\mathbf{A}_{1}=2\\mathbf{a}_{1}$ and $\\mathbf{A}_{2}=2\\mathbf{a}_{2}$. The basis of this cell consists of two identical adatoms located at positions $\\mathbf{r}_{1}=\\mathbf{0}$ and $\\mathbf{r}_{2}=\\mathbf{t}=\\mathbf{a}_{1}+\\mathbf{a}_{2}$.\n\nFirst, we determine the form of the overlayer reciprocal-lattice vectors $\\mathbf{G}$ in the substrate reciprocal basis. The periodicity of the diffraction pattern is dictated by the periodicity of the overlayer lattice, not its basis. The lattice itself can be considered a simple rectangular lattice generated by translations $\\mathbf{R}_{m,n} = m\\mathbf{A}_{1} + n\\mathbf{A}_{2} = m(2\\mathbf{a}_{1}) + n(2\\mathbf{a}_{2})$ for any integers $m$ and $n$. The reciprocal lattice of this superstructure is spanned by vectors $\\mathbf{B}_{1}$ and $\\mathbf{B}_{2}$ satisfying $\\mathbf{A}_{i} \\cdot \\mathbf{B}_{j} = 2\\pi\\delta_{ij}$.\nFor $\\mathbf{B}_{1}$, we have $(2\\mathbf{a}_{1}) \\cdot \\mathbf{B}_{1} = 2\\pi$. Since $\\mathbf{B}_{1}$ must be parallel to $\\mathbf{a}_{1}$ (and thus $\\mathbf{b}_{1}$), we can write $\\mathbf{B}_{1} = c\\mathbf{b}_{1}$. Substituting this gives $2\\mathbf{a}_{1} \\cdot (c\\mathbf{b}_{1}) = 2c(\\mathbf{a}_{1} \\cdot \\mathbf{b}_{1}) = 2c(2\\pi) = 4\\pi c = 2\\pi$, which solves to $c=1/2$. Thus, $\\mathbf{B}_{1} = \\frac{1}{2}\\mathbf{b}_{1}$.\nSimilarly, for $\\mathbf{B}_{2}$, we find $\\mathbf{B}_{2} = \\frac{1}{2}\\mathbf{b}_{2}$.\nAny reciprocal-lattice vector $\\mathbf{G}$ of this $(2\\times 2)$ superlattice must be an integer linear combination of $\\mathbf{B}_{1}$ and $\\mathbf{B}_{2}$.

This shows that the reciprocal lattice points of the overlayer lie on a grid defined by half-integer multiples of the substrate reciprocal-lattice vectors, as required.\n\nNext, we derive the selection rule for systematic absences. The intensity of diffraction at a reciprocal-lattice point $\\mathbf{G}$ is proportional to $|S(\\mathbf{G})|^2$. For a crystal structure with a basis, the structure factor $S(\\mathbf{G})$ is the product of a lattice sum (which yields delta functions at the reciprocal-lattice points $\\mathbf{G}$) and a unit-cell structure factor, which we denote $S_{\\mathrm{cell}}(\\mathbf{G})$. For the given two-atom basis, the unit-cell structure factor is:\n$$\nS_{\\mathrm{cell}}(\\mathbf{G}) = \\sum_{j=1}^{2} f \\exp(i\\mathbf{G}\\cdot\\mathbf{r}_{j}) = f\\exp(i\\mathbf{G}\\cdot\\mathbf{r}_{1}) + f\\exp(i\\mathbf{G}\\cdot\\mathbf{r}_{2})\n$$\nSubstituting $\\mathbf{r}_{1}=\\mathbf{0}$ and $\\mathbf{r}_{2}=\\mathbf{t}=\\mathbf{a}_{1}+\\mathbf{a}_{2}$:\n$$\nS_{\\mathrm{cell}}(\\mathbf{G}) = f\\exp(i\\mathbf{G}\\cdot\\mathbf{0}) + f\\exp(i\\mathbf{G}\\cdot(\\mathbf{a}_{1}+\\mathbf{a}_{2})) = f[1 + \\exp(i\\mathbf{G}\\cdot(\\mathbf{a}_{1}+\\mathbf{a}_{2}))]\n$$\nSystematic absences occur when $S_{\\mathrm{cell}}(\\mathbf{G})=0$. This requires evaluation of the phase factor $\\exp(i\\mathbf{G}\\cdot(\\mathbf{a}_{1}+\\mathbf{a}_{2}))$. Substituting the expression for $\\mathbf{G}$:\n$$\n\\mathbf{G}\\cdot(\\mathbf{a}_{1}+\\mathbf{a}_{2}) = \\left(\\frac{h}{2}\\mathbf{b}_{1} + \\frac{k}{2}\\mathbf{b}_{2}\\right) \\cdot (\\mathbf{a}_{1}+\\mathbf{a}_{2}) = \\frac{h}{2}(\\mathbf{b}_{1}\\cdot\\mathbf{a}_{1}) + \\frac{k}{2}(\\mathbf{b}_{2}\\cdot\\mathbf{a}_{2}) = \\frac{h}{2}(2\\pi) + \\frac{k}{2}(2\\pi) = \\pi(h+k)\n$$\nThe structure factor is thus:\n$$\nS_{\\mathrm{cell}}(\\mathbf{G}) = f[1 + \\exp(i\\pi(h+k))]\n$$\nAn absence occurs if $S_{\\mathrm{cell}}(\\mathbf{G})=0$, which requires $1 + \\exp(i\\pi(h+k)) = 0$, or $\\exp(i\\pi(h+k)) = -1$. This condition is satisfied if and only if the exponent is an odd integer multiple of $i\\pi$. Therefore, the selection rule for absences is:\n$$\nh+k = 2n+1 \\quad (\\text{for integer } n)\n$$\nDiffraction spots indexed by $(H,K)=(h/2,k/2)$ are absent if the sum of the integer indices $h$ and $k$ is odd. This extinguishes all fractional-order spots where one index ($h$ or $k$) is odd and the other is even. Examples include $(h,k)=(1,0)$, $(0,1)$, $(1,2)$, $(3,0)$, etc. The corresponding spots $(H,K)$ are $(\\frac{1}{2},0)$, $(0,\\frac{1}{2})$, $(\\frac{1}{2},1)$, $(\\frac{3}{2},0)$.\n\nWe now verify this prediction with an explicit calculation for the specified fractional-order spots. The structure factor for any spot $(h, k)$ is given by the general expression above.\nIf $h+k$ is an even integer, $h+k=2n$, then $\\exp(i\\pi(h+k)) = \\exp(i2n\\pi) = 1$, and $S_{\\mathrm{cell}}(\\mathbf{G}) = f[1+1] = 2f$.\nIf $h+k$ is an odd integer, $h+k=2n+1$, then $\\exp(i\\pi(h+k)) = \\exp(i(2n+1)\\pi) = -1$, and $S_{\\mathrm{cell}}(\\mathbf{G}) = f[1-1] = 0$.\n\nSpecializing to the representative points:\n- For $(H,K)=(\\tfrac{1}{2},0)$, the integer indices are $(h,k)=(1,0)$. The sum is $h+k=1+0=1$, which is odd. Therefore, the structure factor is $S(\\mathbf{G}_{1,0}) = f[1+\\exp(i\\pi(1))] = f[1-1]=0$. This spot is absent, as predicted.\n- For $(H,K)=(\\tfrac{1}{2},\\tfrac{1}{2})$, the integer indices are $(h,k)=(1,1)$. The sum is $h+k=1+1=2$, which is even. Therefore, the structure factor is $S(\\mathbf{G}_{1,1}) = f[1+\\exp(i\\pi(2))] = f[1+1]=2f$. This spot is present, as predicted.\n\nFinally, we calculate the normalized kinematic intensity at the fractional-order spot $(H,K)=(\\tfrac{1}{2},\\tfrac{1}{2})$. The intensity $I$ is proportional to the squared magnitude of the structure factor, $I(\\mathbf{G}) \\propto |S(\\mathbf{G})|^2$. The requested normalized intensity is $I(\\tfrac{1}{2},\\tfrac{1}{2})/f^{2} = |S(\\mathbf{G}_{1,1})|^{2}/f^{2}$.\nUsing our result $S(\\mathbf{G}_{1,1}) = 2f$:\n$$\n\\frac{|S(\\mathbf{G}_{1,1})|^{2}}{f^{2}} = \\frac{|2f|^{2}}{f^{2}} = \\frac{4f^{2}}{f^{2}} = 4\n$$\nThe result is a dimensionless number, as required.
