This practice challenges you to derive the pull-off force from the first principles of each model, revealing how their different assumptions about where adhesive forces act—either inside or outside the contact area—lead to quantitatively different outcomes.

Derivation of the DMT Pull-Off Force ($P_{c}^{\\mathrm{DMT}}$)**\n\nThe DMT theory is applicable to systems with relatively stiff materials and long-range adhesive forces. It assumes that the adhesive forces act outside the region of mechanical contact and do not alter the stress distribution within the contact area. The pressure distribution inside the contact is assumed to be identical to that of the non-adhesive Hertz theory.\n\nThe total applied normal force, $P$, is the sum of the elastic repulsive force from the Hertzian contact, $P_{H}$, and the attractive adhesive force, $P_{adh}$:\n$$P = P_{H} + P_{adh}$$\nThe Hertzian force is non-zero only when there is a finite contact area ($a > 0$) or equivalently, a positive indentation ($\\delta > 0$). It is given by $P_{H} = \\frac{4}{3}E^{*}R^{1/2}\\delta^{3/2}$.\n\nThe adhesive force, $P_{adh}$, is calculated using the Derjaguin approximation. This approximation relates the force between a sphere and a flat to the interaction energy per unit area, $w$, between two parallel flat surfaces. For short-range forces, this integrated attractive force is constant and given by:\n$$P_{adh} = -2\\pi R w$$\nThe negative sign indicates an attractive (tensile) force.\n\nThe total force as a function of indentation $\\delta$ is:\n$$P(\\delta) = \\frac{4}{3}E^{*}R^{1/2}\\delta^{3/2} - 2\\pi R w$$\nThe pull-off force, $P_c$, is the minimum (most negative) applied force required to maintain contact. This minimum occurs at the point of separation, which in the DMT model corresponds to zero indentation ($\\delta=0$) and zero contact radius ($a=0$). At this point, the Hertzian repulsive term vanishes.\n$$P_{c}^{\\mathrm{DMT}} = P(\\delta=0) = 0 - 2\\pi R w = -2\\pi R w$$\n\n**2. Derivation of the JKR Pull-Off Force ($P_{c}^{\\mathrm{JKR}}$)**\n\nThe JKR theory is applicable to systems with compliant materials and short-range, strong adhesive forces. In this model, the adhesive forces act within the contact area and are strong enough to deform the surfaces, increasing the contact area beyond the Hertzian prediction for a given load. The model uses a fracture mechanics analogy where the edge of the contact is treated as a crack tip.\n\nThe relationship between the applied load $P$, the contact radius $a$, and the material properties is given by the central JKR equation:\n$$P = \\frac{4E^{*}a^{3}}{3R} - \\sqrt{8\\pi w E^{*} a^{3}}$$\nThe first term represents the repulsive elastic force required to create a contact of radius $a$ (similar to Hertz theory), and the second term represents the attractive adhesive force that pulls the surfaces together.\n\nTo find the pull-off force, we must find the minimum value of $P$ with respect to the contact radius $a$. This corresponds to the point of mechanical instability, where a small decrease in load leads to a catastrophic loss of contact. We find this minimum by differentiating $P$ with respect to $a$ and setting the derivative to zero.\n$$\\frac{dP}{da} = \\frac{d}{da} \\left( \\frac{4E^{*}a^{3}}{3R} - \\sqrt{8\\pi w E^{*}} a^{3/2} \\right) = 0$$\n$$\\frac{4E^{*}}{3R}(3a^{2}) - \\sqrt{8\\pi w E^{*}} \\left(\\frac{3}{2} a^{1/2}\\right) = 0$$\n$$\\frac{4E^{*}a^{2}}{R} = \\frac{3}{2} \\sqrt{8\\pi w E^{*}} a^{1/2}$$\nAssuming $a \\neq 0$, we can divide by $a^{1/2}$ and solve for the contact radius at pull-off, $a_c$.

Physical Origin of the Difference**\n\nThe difference between the two predictions stems fundamentally from where adhesive tractions act and how they couple with elastic deformation.\n\nIn the **DMT model**, adhesive forces are considered long-range and act outside the mechanical contact zone. They do not cause elastic deformation. The pull-off event occurs when the contact area shrinks to zero ($a=0$). At this point, there is no repulsive Hertzian force, and the pull-off force is purely the total integrated attractive force from the surrounding non-contact area, which equals $-2\\pi R w$.\n\nIn the **JKR model**, adhesive forces are short-range and act within the contact area, which they deform and enlarge. The pull-off is an instability event that occurs at a finite contact radius, $a_{c} > 0$. At the moment of pull-off, the stress distribution under the contact includes both a central compressive region (resisting deformation) and a strong tensile region at the contact edge (due to adhesion). The net applied force, $P$, is the integral of this complex stress distribution. The existence of a residual elastic compressive force partially counteracts the adhesive tension. At pull-off, the total internal tensile force due to adhesion is $3\\pi w R$, while the internal compressive force from elastic repulsion is $\\frac{3}{2}\\pi w R$. The net force that must be supplied externally is their sum, $P_{c}^{\\mathrm{JKR}} = -\\frac{3}{2}\\pi w R$.\n\nIn summary, the JKR pull-off force is smaller in magnitude because detachment is an instability of a finite-sized contact where elastic compressive stresses still exist and partially offset the adhesive tensile stresses. The DMT force is larger in magnitude because it represents a pure, un-opposed adhesive attraction at the point of zero contact area.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{4}{3}}$$", "id": "2763419"}, {"introduction": "The JKR theory offers a rich description of 'soft' adhesive contacts, yielding predictions that diverge sharply from non-adhesive Hertzian mechanics.

Within the Johnson–Kendall–Roberts (JKR) theory of adhesive contact, there exists a nonzero equilibrium contact radius at zero load due to interfacial adhesion.\n\nStarting from fundamental principles, use the Griffith energy balance for an axisymmetric crack at the contact edge (equate the energy release rate to the work of adhesion) together with the classical, non-adhesive Hertz relations between load, indentation, and contact radius, to obtain the zero-load JKR contact radius $a_0$ as a function of $R$, $E^*$, and $w$.

The primary tasks are to derive the expressions for the equilibrium contact radius and indentation at zero load, compare this with the non-adhesive Hertzian model, and compute a numerical value for the contact radius.\n\nThe JKR theory is founded on a Griffith-type energy balance applied to the contact problem. The total energy of the system is the sum of the stored elastic strain energy, $U_E$, and the surface energy, $U_S$. Adhesion reduces the surface energy as contact is made, so $U_S = -wA$, where $w$ is the work of adhesion and $A$ is the contact area. For a circular contact of radius $a$, $A = \\pi a^2$. The elastic energy is stored due to the deformation of the half-space.\n\nThe equilibrium state is found by balancing the release of elastic energy with the energy required to create new surfaces at the contact edge. The Griffith criterion for equilibrium of a crack states that the energy release rate, $G$, must be equal to the work of adhesion, $w$. Applying this principle to the geometry of a spherical contact, and utilizing the elasticity solutions for a Hertzian contact, one arrives at the celebrated JKR equation relating the external applied load, $P$, to the resulting contact radius, $a$:\n$$ P(a) = \\frac{4E^{*}a^{3}}{3R} - \\sqrt{8\\pi w E^{*} a^{3}} $$\nHere, $R$ is the sphere radius and $E^{*}$ is the plane-strain composite modulus. The first term on the right-hand side represents the classical Hertzian repulsive force for a contact of radius $a$, while the second term accounts for the attractive adhesive forces concentrated at the contact perimeter.\n\nFirst, we determine the equilibrium contact radius at zero load, $a_0$. We set the external load $P=0$ in the JKR equation:\n$$ 0 = \\frac{4E^{*}a_0^{3}}{3R} - \\sqrt{8\\pi w E^{*} a_0^{3}} $$\nAssuming a non-zero contact radius, $a_0 > 0$, we can rearrange the equation:\n$$ \\frac{4E^{*}a_0^{3}}{3R} = \\sqrt{8\\pi w E^{*} a_0^{3}} $$\nSquaring both sides of the equation gives:\n$$ \\left( \\frac{4E^{*}a_0^{3}}{3R} \\right)^2 = 8\\pi w E^{*} a_0^{3} $$\n$$ \\frac{16(E^{*})^2 a_0^{6}}{9R^2} = 8\\pi w E^{*} a_0^{3} $$\nDividing by $8\\pi w E^{*} a_0^{3}$ (which is non-zero) and solving for $a_0^3$:\n$$ a_0^3 = \\frac{9R^2 \\cdot 8\\pi w E^{*}}{16(E^{*})^2} = \\frac{9\\pi w R^2}{2E^{*}} $$\nThus, the zero-load JKR contact radius is:\n$$ a_0 = \\left( \\frac{9\\pi w R^2}{2E^{*}} \\right)^{1/3} $$\n\nNext, we find the corresponding surface approach or indentation, $\\delta_0$, at zero load. The JKR theory also provides the relationship between indentation $\\delta$ and contact radius $a$:\n$$ \\delta(a) = \\frac{a^2}{R} - \\sqrt{\\frac{2\\pi w a}{E^{*}}} $$\nTo evaluate this at zero load, we must first simplify the second term using the zero-load equilibrium condition, $\\frac{4E^{*}a_0^{3}}{3R} = \\sqrt{8\\pi w E^{*} a_0^{3}}$. By squaring the equilibrium condition, we get $\\frac{16(E^{*})^2 a_0^{6}}{9R^2} = 8\\pi w E^{*} a_0^{3}$. Solving for $\\pi w$ yields $\\pi w = \\frac{2E^* a_0^3}{9R^2}$. Now we can substitute this expression for $\\pi w$ into the term we want to simplify:\n$$ \\sqrt{\\frac{2\\pi w a_0}{E^{*}}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{2a_0}{E^{*}} \\left( \\frac{2 E^* a_0^3}{9R^2} \\right)} = \\sqrt{\\frac{4 a_0^4}{9R^2}} = \\frac{2a_0^2}{3R} $$\nSubstituting this result back into the expression for $\\delta_0$:\n$$ \\delta_0 = \\frac{a_0^2}{R} - \\frac{2a_0^2}{3R} = \\frac{a_0^2}{3R} $$\nThe indentation at zero load is positive, meaning the surfaces have moved towards each other from the point of first contact.\n\nNow, we consider what the non-adhesive Hertz theory would predict for this indentation $\\delta_0$. In Hertz theory, the relationship between indentation $\\delta_H$ and contact radius $a_H$ is purely geometric:\n$$ a_H^2 = R \\delta_H $$\nIf we impose an indentation equal to the JKR zero-load value, $\\delta_H = \\delta_0 = \\frac{a_0^2}{3R}$, the corresponding Hertzian contact radius $a_H$ would be:\n$$ a_H^2 = R \\left( \\frac{a_0^2}{3R} \\right) = \\frac{a_0^2}{3} $$\n$$ a_H = \\frac{a_0}{\\sqrt{3}} $$\nSince $a_0$ is a real, positive quantity, the indentation $\\delta_0$ is also real and positive. The Hertzian contact radius $a_H$ corresponding to this positive indentation is therefore also a real, non-zero value. Thus, Hertz theory does predict a real, nonzero contact for the indentation level $\\delta_0$. However, it is important to note that in Hertz theory, a positive indentation $\\delta_0$ would require a non-zero compressive load $P_H = \\frac{4}{3}E^* R^{1/2} \\delta_0^{3/2} > 0$, whereas in JKR theory this state is achieved at $P=0$.\n\nFinally, we compute the numerical value of $a_0$.

It presents a standard, albeit advanced, conceptual question in the field of contact mechanics. The provided definitions and guiding principles are consistent with established theory. The problem is valid and a rigorous analysis can be performed.\n\nThe Johnson–Kendall–Roberts (JKR) theory provides a model for adhesive contact between a smooth elastic sphere of radius $R$ and a smooth elastic half-space with effective modulus $E^*$. The key assumptions are that adhesive forces are infinitely short-ranged, acting only within the area of contact, and that the system behavior is elastic and quasi-static. The thermodynamic work of adhesion is $w$. Under these assumptions, no force is experienced between the bodies until they make contact at $\\delta=0$. Upon separation, a finite tensile force, the pull-off force $P_c$, is required, given by:\n$$P_c = -\\frac{3}{2}\\pi R w$$\nThis pull-off is an instability, or a \"snap-off,\" from a finite contact radius. In a displacement-controlled experiment, the ideal JKR theory predicts a hysteretic loop, but this hysteresis arises from the system choosing between stable and metastable equilibrium branches, not from intrinsic dissipation. The theory serves as a crucial baseline, and deviations from its predictions in experimental data indicate a failure of one or more of its underlying assumptions. We are tasked with identifying such signatures of failure due to long-range forces or surface roughness.\n\nWe analyze the provided options based on fundamental principles of contact mechanics.\n\nOption A: \"During approach, a pronounced snap-in instability occurs at a finite positive separation with a sudden jump in $\\delta$ at near $P \\approx 0$, and the initial approach shows a measurable attractive force before contact formation, accompanied by a reduced apparent contact stiffness; this indicates forces acting outside the contact.\"\nThis description is a hallmark of adhesive interactions that are not short-ranged. The JKR assumption is that interactions are zero outside the contact patch. If long-range forces are present (e.g., van der Waals forces), they manifest as an attractive force $F_{\\mathrm{adh}}(z)$ even when the surfaces are separated by a gap $z > 0$. The total force is $P(\\delta) = P_{\\mathrm{contact}}(\\delta) + F_{\\mathrm{adh}}(z(\\delta))$. Before contact, $P_{\\mathrm{contact}} = 0$, so any measured force is purely adhesive. The system's total stiffness is $k_{\\mathrm{total}} = \\partial P/\\partial\\delta = k_{\\mathrm{contact}} + k_{\\mathrm{adh}}$, where $k_{\\mathrm{adh}} = \\partial F_{\\mathrm{adh}}/\\partial z \\cdot (\\partial z/\\partial \\delta)$. For an attractive force, typically $\\partial F_{\\mathrm{adh}}/\\partial z > 0$ (force becomes more attractive as separation decreases), but since $z$ decreases as $\\delta$ increases, this contributes a negative term to the stiffness. When this negative adhesive stiffness overcomes the positive stiffness of the measurement apparatus, the system becomes unstable and \"snaps\" into a stable contact configuration. This is precisely the behavior predicted by the Derjaguin-Muller-Toporov (DMT) theory, which is the limiting case for long-range, weak adhesion. Therefore, the observation of pre-contact attraction and a snap-in instability on approach is a definitive failure of the JKR assumption of short-range forces.\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\nOption B: \"The $P$–$\\delta$ curve is single-valued and monotonic during approach, shows no measurable attraction prior to first contact, exhibits no hysteresis between loading and unloading, and the pull-off force matches the smooth-surface JKR prediction; this indicates failure of JKR due to roughness.\"\nThis statement is logically flawed. The described features—no pre-contact attraction, no hysteresis (implying a perfectly reversible path without jumping between metastable states), and a pull-off force matching the theoretical value $P_c = -(3/2)\\pi R w$—are the defining characteristics of an idealized JKR contact under specific experimental conditions (e.g., force control or a perfectly reversible displacement path). The conclusion that these observations indicate a *failure* of JKR theory due to roughness is a direct contradiction. Surface roughness is known to *reduce* the pull-off force and *introduce* significant hysteresis due to progressive, dissipative detachment of micro-contacts. The described curve is a validation of JKR, not a refutation.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\nOption C: \"Under ambient humidity, the unloading branch exhibits an extended plateau of nearly constant attractive load over a finite separation range before a sudden rupture at a relatively large separation, producing substantial hysteresis between approach and retraction; this indicates a long-range capillary contribution not accounted for in JKR.\"\nThis accurately describes the phenomenon of capillary adhesion. In a humid environment, a liquid meniscus can form in the contact gap. The negative Laplace pressure within this meniscus generates a strong, long-range attractive force. As the surfaces are pulled apart, this meniscus can stretch, maintaining a nearly constant attractive force over a significant range of separation, which appears as a plateau on the retraction curve. The eventual rupture of this liquid bridge is an instability that occurs at a separation distance much larger than the atomic scale relevant to dry JKR contact. This entire process is fundamentally different from the solid-solid adhesion modeled by JKR, creating a large hysteretic loop. It is a classic example of a long-range interaction not included in the standard JKR model.\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\nOption D: \"As the measured roughness amplitude $h_{\\mathrm{rms}}$ increases, the pull-off load $P_{\\mathrm{c}}$ systematically decreases relative to the smooth-surface JKR value, and the $P$–$\\delta$ loops become increasingly hysteretic and rate dependent due to progressive detachment of microcontacts; this indicates breakdown of the smooth, single-contact JKR picture.\"\nThis statement correctly identifies the primary consequences of surface roughness. The JKR model assumes perfectly smooth surfaces creating a single, simply-connected contact area. Real surfaces are rough, so contact is established over a population of discrete asperity micro-contacts. To achieve intimate contact, these asperities must be elastically deformed, which stores strain energy. This stored energy aids separation, effectively reducing the net work of adhesion and, consequently, the pull-off force $P_c$. The inequality $P_c(\\text{rough}) < P_c(\\text{JKR})$ is a well-established result. Furthermore, separation is not a singular event but a complex, sequential process of individual micro-contact detachments. This progressive failure is dissipative and results in significant hysteresis. The dynamics of these multi-asperity ruptures can also depend on the pulling speed, introducing rate dependence not present in the quasi-static JKR model. These phenomena represent a clear breakdown of the 'smooth surface' assumption of JKR theory.\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\nOption E: \"After contact is established and as compressive load increases, an extended region is observed where the measured contact area shrinks with increasing $P$ and the slope $\\partial P/\\partial \\delta$ remains positive; this indicates entry into the Derjaguin–Muller–Toporov (DMT) limit and thus a failure of JKR.\"\nThis statement is physically nonsensical. For any standard model of elastic or adhesive contact (including JKR, DMT, and Hertz), an increase in compressive load ($P > 0$) must be supported by an increase in the contact area $a$. The proposition that contact area *shrinks* as compressive load *increases* ($da/dP < 0$ for $P>0$) violates fundamental mechanical equilibrium. While adhesive forces can cause the contact radius to be larger than the non-adhesive Hertzian prediction at a given load, the derivative $da/dP$ remains positive for all compressive loads. Entry into the DMT limit is governed by the Tabor parameter, which depends on material properties, geometry, and adhesion energy, not on the applied load in a single experiment. The described behavior is not a feature of the DMT limit or any other established contact theory; it is a physical impossibility for the system described.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{ACD}$$", "id": "2763396"}]}
