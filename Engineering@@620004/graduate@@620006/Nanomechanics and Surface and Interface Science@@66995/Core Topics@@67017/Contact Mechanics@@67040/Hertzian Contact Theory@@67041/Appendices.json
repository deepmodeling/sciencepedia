Hertzian contact theory provides an elegant simplification by mapping this two-body problem onto an equivalent system: a rigid body indenting an elastic half-space whose properties are defined by a single effective modulus, $E^*$. This foundational exercise guides you through the derivation of this crucial parameter, revealing how the Young's moduli and Poisson's ratios of both contacting materials are combined to govern the overall elastic response of the interface [@problem_id:2891983].", "problem": "Two homogeneous, isotropic, linear elastic bodies come into frictionless, axisymmetric normal contact under a slowly applied load within the regime where classical Hertzian assumptions hold: small strains, small contact area relative to characteristic radii of curvature, and no adhesion. Let the Young’s moduli be $E_1$ and $E_2$, with Poisson’s ratios $\\nu_1$ and $\\nu_2$, respectively. The normal surface approach is the sum of the individual half-space surface displacements produced by the same axisymmetric pressure distribution due to linearity and superposition.\n\nStarting from the fundamental base of linear elasticity (Hooke’s law) and the classical Boussinesq solution for the normal displacement of an isotropic elastic half-space due to normal loading, derive the material combination that defines the Hertzian effective (or reduced) modulus $E^*$ for two bodies in contact so that the normal displacement field in the contact region depends on the materials only through $E^*$.

The final answer must be a single real number equal to this rounded $E^*$.", "solution": "The problem as stated is valid. It is a well-posed problem in classical linear elastic contact mechanics, free of scientific or logical flaws. The necessary data is provided, and the objectives are clear. We shall proceed with the derivation and subsequent calculations.\n\nThe problem requires the derivation of the effective modulus, $E^*$, for two elastic bodies in contact. The starting point is the Boussinesq solution for the normal displacement of an elastic half-space subjected to a surface pressure distribution.\n\nLet us consider an elastic half-space with Young's modulus $E$ and Poisson's ratio $\\nu$. When subjected to a pressure distribution $p(\\xi, \\eta)$ over a contact area $\\Omega$ on its surface ($z=0$), the normal displacement $u_z$ at a point $(x, y)$ on the surface is given by the integral of the point load solution:\n$$ u_z(x,y) = \\frac{1-\\nu^2}{\\pi E} \\iint_{\\Omega} \\frac{p(\\xi, \\eta)}{\\sqrt{(x-\\xi)^2 + (y-\\eta)^2}} d\\xi d\\eta $$\nThis result is a direct consequence of the linear theory of elasticity.\n\nThe problem states that two bodies, designated body $1$ and body $2$, are in contact. Their material properties are $(E_1, \\nu_1)$ and $(E_2, \\nu_2)$, respectively. According to Newton's third law, the pressure distribution $p(\\xi, \\eta)$ exerted by body $1$ on body $2$ is identical in magnitude to the pressure exerted by body $2$ on body $1$. Within the Hertzian framework, the total normal approach of the surfaces is the sum of the individual surface displacements, $u_{z1}$ and $u_{z2}$.\n\nThe displacement of the surface of body $1$, $u_{z1}$, is:\n$$ u_{z1}(x,y) = \\frac{1-\\nu_1^2}{\\pi E_1} \\iint_{\\Omega} \\frac{p(\\xi, \\eta)}{\\sqrt{(x-\\xi)^2 + (y-\\eta)^2}} d\\xi d\\eta $$\nAnd the displacement of the surface of body $2$, $u_{z2}$, is:\n$$ u_{z2}(x,y) = \\frac{1-\\nu_2^2}{\\pi E_2} \\iint_{\\Omega} \\frac{p(\\xi, \\eta)}{\\sqrt{(x-\\xi)^2 + (y-\\eta)^2}} d\\xi d\\eta $$\nThe total normal displacement, $u_z(x,y) = u_{z1}(x,y) + u_{z2}(x,y)$, is therefore:\n$$ u_z(x,y) = \\left( \\frac{1-\\nu_1^2}{\\pi E_1} + \\frac{1-\\nu_2^2}{\\pi E_2} \\right) \\iint_{\\Omega} \\frac{p(\\xi, \\eta)}{\\sqrt{(x-\\xi)^2 + (y-\\eta)^2}} d\\xi d\\eta $$\nWe can factor out the common integral term and combine the material properties:\n$$ u_z(x,y) = \\frac{1}{\\pi} \\left( \\frac{1-\\nu_1^2}{E_1} + \\frac{1-\\nu_2^2}{E_2} \\right) \\iint_{\\Omega} \\frac{p(\\xi, \\eta)}{\\sqrt{(x-\\xi)^2 + (y-\\eta)^2}} d\\xi d\\eta $$\nThe problem requires us to define an effective modulus $E^*$ such that the displacement field depends on the material properties solely through this a single parameter. Comparing the above expression with the form for a single body, we can see that the entire material dependence is contained within the parenthesis. The standard definition of the Hertzian effective modulus $E^*$ is chosen to consolidate these terms:\n$$ \\frac{1}{E^*} = \\frac{1-\\nu_1^2}{E_1} + \\frac{1-\\nu_2^2}{E_2} $$\nWith this definition, the total displacement becomes:\n$$ u_z(x,y) = \\frac{1}{\\pi E^*} \\iint_{\\Omega} \\frac{p(\\xi, \\eta)}{\\sqrt{(x-\\xi)^2 + (y-\\eta)^2}} d\\xi d\\eta $$\nThis achieves the required formulation. The two-body contact problem is thus mapped onto an equivalent problem of a rigid body indenting an elastic half-space with modulus $E^*$ and an effective Poisson's ratio of $0$.\n\nNext, we evaluate $E^*$ for the given material properties: $E_1=210\\,\\mathrm{GPa}$, $\\nu_1=0.3$, $E_2=70\\,\\mathrm{GPa}$, and $\\nu_2=0.2$.\nSubstituting these values into the derived expression for $1/E^*$:\n$$ \\frac{1}{E^*} = \\frac{1 - (0.3)^2}{210\\,\\mathrm{GPa}} + \\frac{1 - (0.2)^2}{70\\,\\mathrm{GPa}} $$\n$$ \\frac{1}{E^*} = \\frac{1 - 0.09}{210\\,\\mathrm{GPa}} + \\frac{1 - 0.04}{70\\,\\mathrm{GPa}} $$\n$$ \\frac{1}{E^*} = \\frac{0.91}{210\\,\\mathrm{GPa}} + \\frac{0.96}{70\\,\\mathrm{GPa}} $$\nTo combine the terms, we find a common denominator:\n$$ \\frac{1}{E^*} = \\frac{0.91}{210\\,\\mathrm{GPa}} + \\frac{3 \\times 0.96}{3 \\times 70\\,\\mathrm{GPa}} = \\frac{0.91 + 2.88}{210\\,\\mathrm{GPa}} = \\frac{3.79}{210\\,\\mathrm{GPa}} $$\nTherefore, the effective modulus $E^*$ is:\n$$ E^* = \\frac{210}{3.79}\\,\\mathrm{GPa} \\approx 55.40897\\,\\mathrm{GPa} $$\nRounding to four significant figures as required, we obtain $E^* = 55.41\\,\\mathrm{GPa}$.\n\nFinally, we analyze the behavior of $E^*$ as $\\nu_1 \\to 0.5$ and $\\nu_2 \\to 0.5$. A Poisson's ratio of $\\nu=0.5$ corresponds to the limit of incompressibility for an isotropic elastic material.\nThe expression for $E^*$ is $E^* = \\left( \\frac{1-\\nu_1^2}{E_1} + \\frac{1-\\nu_2^2}{E_2} \\right)^{-1}$.\nAs $\\nu_i$ increases in the range $[0, 0.5]$, the term $(1-\\nu_i^2)$ decreases. Consequently, the sum $\\frac{1-\\nu_1^2}{E_1} + \\frac{1-\\nu_2^2}{E_2}$, which is equal to $1/E^*$, also decreases. Since $1/E^*$ is a decreasing function of $\\nu_1$ and $\\nu_2$, its reciprocal, $E^*$, must be an increasing function. Qualitatively, as the materials become more incompressible, an increasing normal force is required to achieve the same indentation depth, meaning the contact becomes effectively stiffer, which is reflected by a higher value of $E^*$.\n\nQuantitatively, we evaluate $E^*$ at the limit where $\\nu_1 = 0.5$ and $\\nu_2 = 0.5$:\n$$ \\lim_{\\nu_1, \\nu_2 \\to 0.5} \\frac{1}{E^*} = \\frac{1 - (0.5)^2}{210\\,\\mathrm{GPa}} + \\frac{1 - (0.5)^2}{70\\,\\mathrm{GPa}} $$\n$$ \\frac{1}{E^*_{limit}} = \\frac{0.75}{210\\,\\mathrm{GPa}} + \\frac{0.75}{70\\,\\mathrm{GPa}} = 0.75 \\left( \\frac{1}{210} + \\frac{3}{210} \\right)\\,\\mathrm{GPa}^{-1} $$\n$$ \\frac{1}{E^*_{limit}} = 0.75 \\left( \\frac{4}{210} \\right)\\,\\mathrm{GPa}^{-1} = \\frac{3}{4} \\frac{4}{210}\\,\\mathrm{GPa}^{-1} = \\frac{3}{210}\\,\\mathrm{GPa}^{-1} = \\frac{1}{70}\\,\\mathrm{GPa}^{-1} $$\nThus, the limiting value of the effective modulus is $E^*_{limit} = 70\\,\\mathrm{GPa}$.\nComparing this to the value calculated for the given parameters ($E^* \\approx 55.41\\,\\mathrm{GPa}$), we see a quantitative increase of $E^*_{limit} - E^* \\approx 70 - 55.41 = 14.59\\,\\mathrm{GPa}$. This represents a substantial increase in contact stiffness of approximately $26.3\\%$. The effective modulus $E^*$ is bounded by the cases of $\\nu_1=\\nu_2=0$ ($E^*=52.5\\,\\mathrm{GPa}$) and $\\nu_1=\\nu_2=0.5$ ($E^*=70\\,\\mathrm{GPa}$) for the given Young's moduli.\n\nThe requested final answer is the numerical value for $E^*$ rounded to four significant figures for the given parameters.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{55.41}\n$$", "id": "2891983"}, {"introduction": "With a theoretical understanding of the effective modulus $E^*$, the next logical step is to determine its value from experimental measurements.

The numerical values are physically realistic for a micro- or macro-indentation experiment on a metallic or ceramic material. The problem violates none of the invalidity criteria. Therefore, the problem is deemed valid and a solution will be derived.\n\nThe core task is to relate the applied load $P$ to the penetration depth $\\delta$. This relationship is central to Hertzian contact mechanics. For the specified configuration—a sphere indenting a flat half-space—the pressure distribution $p(r)$ over the circular contact area of radius $a$ is ellipsoidal:\n$$\np(r) = p_0 \\sqrt{1 - \\left(\\frac{r}{a}\\right)^2}\n$$\nwhere $p_0$ is the maximum pressure at the center of contact ($r=0$). The total applied load $P$ is the integral of this pressure distribution over the contact area:\n$$\nP = \\int_{0}^{a} p(r) \\, 2\\pi r \\, dr = 2\\pi p_0 \\int_{0}^{a} r \\sqrt{1 - \\left(\\frac{r}{a}\\right)^2} dr = \\frac{2}{3} \\pi a^2 p_0\n$$\nClassical elasticity theory provides two additional key relations for this contact problem. First, the contact radius $a$ is related to the penetration depth $\\delta$ and the effective radius of curvature $R^*$ by the geometric constraint for small deformations:\n$$\n\\delta = \\frac{a^2}{R^*} \\quad \\implies \\quad a = \\sqrt{\\delta R^*}\n$$\nSecond, the contact radius $a$ is related to the load $P$ and the material properties through the effective modulus $E^*$:\n$$\na^3 = \\frac{3PR^*}{4E^*}\n$$\nThis relation is a direct consequence of integrating the surface displacements from the Boussinesq solution under the Hertzian pressure distribution. The effective modulus $E^*$ is defined by\n$$\n\\frac{1}{E^*} = \\frac{1-\\nu_1^2}{E_1} + \\frac{1-\\nu_2^2}{E_2}\n$$\nwhere ($E_1, \\nu_1$) are the properties of the indenter and ($E_2, \\nu_2$) are for the half-space. As the indenter is rigid, its Young's modulus $E_1 \\to \\infty$, which makes the first term $\\frac{1-\\nu_1^2}{E_1} \\to 0$. Thus, $E^*$ simplifies to the plane-strain modulus of the substrate, $E^* = \\frac{E_2}{1-\\nu_2^2}$. The problem asks us to compute this quantity $E^*$.\n\nTo derive the relationship between $P$ and $\\delta$, we combine the established equations. We substitute the geometric relation $a = \\sqrt{\\delta R^*}$ into the load-radius relation $a^3 = \\frac{3PR^*}{4E^*}$:\n$$\n(\\sqrt{\\delta R^*})^3 = \\frac{3PR^*}{4E^*}\n$$\n$$\n(\\delta R^*)^{3/2} = \\frac{3PR^*}{4E^*}\n$$\nSolving for the load $P$:\n$$\nP = \\frac{4E^*}{3R^*} (\\delta R^*)^{3/2} = \\frac{4E^*}{3R^*} \\delta^{3/2} (R^*)^{3/2}\n$$\nThis simplifies to the Hertzian load-penetration equation:\n$$\nP = \\frac{4}{3} E^* \\sqrt{R^*} \\delta^{3/2}\n$$\nThis equation establishes the theoretical scaling law between load and penetration.\n\nWe now analyze this result in the context of the provided logarithmic regression model, $\\log_{10} P = \\hat{\\alpha} + \\hat{\\beta}\\,\\log_{10} \\delta$. Taking the base-$10$ logarithm of the theoretical Hertzian equation gives:\n$$\n\\log_{10} P = \\log_{10}\\left( \\frac{4}{3} E^* \\sqrt{R^*} \\delta^{3/2} \\right) = \\log_{10}\\left( \\frac{4 E^* \\sqrt{R^*}}{3} \\right) + \\log_{10}(\\delta^{3/2})\n$$\n$$\n\\log_{10} P = \\log_{10}\\left( \\frac{4 E^* \\sqrt{R^*}}{3} \\right) + \\frac{3}{2} \\log_{10} \\delta\n$$\nBy comparing this theoretical form with the empirical regression model, we can make the following identifications:\nThe theoretical slope is $\\beta = \\frac{3}{2} = 1.5$.\nThe theoretical intercept is $\\alpha = \\log_{10}\\left( \\frac{4 E^* \\sqrt{R^*}}{3} \\right)$.\n\nFirst, we verify the consistency of the measured slope $\\hat{\\beta} = 1.497$. The standard error is given as $s_{\\hat{\\beta}} = 0.015$. A simple check is to observe the difference between the theoretical and measured values in terms of the standard error: $|\\hat{\\beta} - \\beta| = |1.497 - 1.5| = 0.003$. This deviation is only $0.003 / 0.015 = 0.2$ standard errors, indicating excellent agreement. The measured slope is statistically indistinguishable from the theoretical Hertzian exponent of $1.5$.\n\nNext, we use the intercept to compute $E^*$. The measured intercept is $\\hat{\\alpha} = 9.900$.\n$$\n\\hat{\\alpha} = \\log_{10}\\left( \\frac{4 E^* \\sqrt{R^*}}{3} \\right)\n$$\nWe solve for $E^*$.
