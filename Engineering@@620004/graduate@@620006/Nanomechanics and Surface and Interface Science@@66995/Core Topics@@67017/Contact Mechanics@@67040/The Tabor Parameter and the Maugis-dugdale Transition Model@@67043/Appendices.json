It is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and contains all necessary information for derivation. No inconsistencies or logical flaws are present. We shall proceed with the solution.\n\nThe problem asks for the derivation of the contact radius at pull-off, $a_c$, in the two limiting cases of contact mechanics: the Johnson-Kendall-Roberts (JKR) model and the Derjaguin-Muller-Toporov (DMT) model. We will then discuss the transition between these limits.\n\n1) Derivation of $a_c^{\\mathrm{JKR}}$\n\nThe JKR model is valid for compliant materials with strong, short-range adhesion, corresponding to the limit of large Tabor parameter, $\\mu \\to \\infty$. In this model, adhesive forces are assumed to act only within the area of contact, $\\pi a^2$. The adhesion modifies the stress distribution at the contact edge, creating a stress singularity akin to a crack tip. The Griffith energy balance criterion is implicitly satisfied in the formulation of the JKR theory, which leads to the following relationship between the applied load $P$ and the contact radius $a$:\n\n$$\nP(a) = \\frac{4E^{\\ast}a^3}{3R} - \\sqrt{8\\pi w E^{\\ast} a^3}\n$$\n\nThe first term represents the compressive Hertzian force, and the second term represents the tensile adhesive force. The pull-off phenomenon corresponds to a mechanical instability. The pull-off force, $P_c$, is the minimum (most negative) load that can be sustained by the contact. To find this minimum, we must differentiate $P(a)$ with respect to $a$ and set the derivative to zero.\n\nLet us rewrite the load as a function of $a$:\n$$\nP(a) = \\frac{4E^{\\ast}}{3R} a^3 - \\sqrt{8\\pi w E^{\\ast}} a^{3/2}\n$$\n\nThe derivative is:\n$$\n\\frac{dP}{da} = \\frac{d}{da} \\left( \\frac{4E^{\\ast}}{3R} a^3 - \\sqrt{8\\pi w E^{\\ast}} a^{3/2} \\right) = \\frac{4E^{\\ast}}{3R} (3a^2) - \\sqrt{8\\pi w E^{\\ast}} \\left(\\frac{3}{2} a^{1/2}\\right)\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{dP}{da} = \\frac{4E^{\\ast}a^2}{R} - \\frac{3}{2}\\sqrt{8\\pi w E^{\\ast}} a^{1/2}\n$$\n\nSetting this derivative to zero defines the contact radius at the point of instability, which is the pull-off contact radius, $a_c^{\\mathrm{JKR}}$:\n$$\n\\frac{4E^{\\ast}(a_c^{\\mathrm{JKR}})^2}{R} = \\frac{3}{2}\\sqrt{8\\pi w E^{\\ast}} (a_c^{\\mathrm{JKR}})^{1/2}\n$$\n\nWe can solve for $a_c^{\\mathrm{JKR}}$. Assuming $a_c^{\\mathrm{JKR}} \\neq 0$, we can divide by $(a_c^{\\mathrm{JKR}})^{1/2}$:\n$$\n\\frac{4E^{\\ast}}{R} (a_c^{\\mathrm{JKR}})^{3/2} = \\frac{3}{2}\\sqrt{8\\pi w E^{\\ast}}\n$$\nTo simplify, we square both sides of the equation:\n$$\n\\left( \\frac{4E^{\\ast}}{R} (a_c^{\\mathrm{JKR}})^{3/2} \\right)^2 = \\left( \\frac{3}{2}\\sqrt{8\\pi w E^{\\ast}} \\right)^2\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{16E^{\\ast 2}}{R^2} (a_c^{\\mathrm{JKR}})^3 = \\frac{9}{4} (8\\pi w E^{\\ast}) = 18\\pi w E^{\\ast}\n$$\nNow, we isolate $(a_c^{\\mathrm{JKR}})^3$:\n$$\n(a_c^{\\mathrm{JKR}})^3 = \\frac{18\\pi w E^{\\ast} R^2}{16E^{\\ast 2}} = \\frac{9\\pi w R^2}{8E^{\\ast}}\n$$\nTaking the cube root gives the contact radius at pull-off in the JKR limit:\n$$\na_c^{\\mathrm{JKR}} = \\left(\\frac{9\\pi w R^2}{8E^{\\ast}}\\right)^{1/3}\n$$\nThis is a finite, non-zero radius, which is a key feature of the JKR theory.\n\n2) Derivation of $a_c^{\\mathrm{DMT}}$\n\nThe DMT model is valid for stiff materials with weak, long-range adhesion, corresponding to the limit of small Tabor parameter, $\\mu \\to 0$. In this model, the adhesive forces are assumed to act outside the contact area, while the mechanics within the contact area are purely Hertzian. The adhesive forces sum to an attractive load, $P_{ad}$, that is independent of the contact radius $a$. For a sphere-plane geometry, this adhesive load is:\n$$\nP_{ad} = -2\\pi R w\n$$\nThe total load $P$ on the sphere is the sum of the Hertzian contact force and this external adhesive load:\n$$\nP(a) = P_H(a) + P_{ad} = \\frac{4E^{\\ast}a^3}{3R} - 2\\pi R w\n$$\nIn the DMT model, the load $P(a)$ is a monotonically increasing function of the contact radius $a$ for $a \\ge 0$. An instability does not occur at a finite contact radius. Instead, pull-off happens when the contact area shrinks to zero. To find the load at pull-off, we evaluate $P(a)$ as $a \\to 0$:\n$$\nP_c = P(a=0) = -2\\pi R w\n$$\nThis is the maximum tensile force the junction can withstand. The question asks for the contact radius *at* pull-off. By definition in the DMT model, pull-off occurs precisely when contact is lost. Therefore, the contact radius at the moment of pull-off is zero.\n$$\na_c^{\\mathrm{DMT}} = 0\n$$\n\n3) Qualitative discussion on the effect of $\\mu$\n\nThe Tabor parameter, $\\mu = \\left(\\frac{R\\,w^{2}}{E^{\\ast 2}\\,z_{0}^{3}}\\right)^{1/3}$, represents the ratio of the elastic deformation due to adhesion to the range of action of the adhesive forces, $z_0$. The Maugis-Dugdale model provides a unified description that continuously connects the DMT and JKR limits.\n\nAs $\\mu \\to 0$ (DMT limit), we have the case of a stiff solid or long-range forces. The contact profile is not significantly deformed by adhesion, and the problem reduces to Hertzian contact under an additional attractive load. Pull-off is governed by the global force balance, and detachment occurs when the contact vanishes, i.e., $a_c \\to 0$.\n\nAs $\\mu \\to \\infty$ (JKR limit), we have the case of a compliant solid or short-range forces. Adhesive forces cause significant elastic deformation, creating a \"neck\" at the contact periphery. The stress concentrates at the contact edge, behaving like a crack tip. Pull-off is a fracture-like instability, occurring abruptly while the contact area is still finite. As we derived, $a_c \\to \\left(\\frac{9\\pi w R^2}{8E^{\\ast}}\\right)^{1/3}$.\n\nFor intermediate values of $\\mu$, the Maugis-Dugdale model shows that the contact radius at pull-off, $a_c$, is a monotonically increasing function of $\\mu$. It smoothly transitions from $a_c = 0$ at $\\mu = 0$ to the finite JKR value as $\\mu \\to \\infty$. The physical mechanism governing this trend is the changing nature of the adhesive stress field. As $\\mu$ increases, the adhesive stress becomes increasingly concentrated at the perimeter of the contact, shifting the pull-off mechanism from a global force-balance failure (DMT) to a local, crack-like instability (JKR). This transition naturally leads to an increase in the contact size that can be sustained under tension just before failure.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\begin{bmatrix} \\left(\\frac{9\\pi w R^{2}}{8E^{\\ast}}\\right)^{1/3} & 0 \\end{bmatrix}}$$", "id": "2794406"}, {"introduction": "Having established the distinct JKR and DMT limits, our next step is to build a bridge between them.

This will be accomplished by first deriving the expressions for the contact radius in the two limiting cases, DMT and JKR, and then using the prescribed interpolation formula.\n\n**1. DMT-Limit Zero-Load Contact Radius ($a_{\\mathrm{DMT},0}$)**\n\nIn the Derjaguin–Muller–Toporov (DMT) model, adhesive forces are considered to act outside the contact area. Their integrated effect is equivalent to a constant attractive force, $P_{adhesion}$, that pulls the sphere and the half-space together. This force has a magnitude of $2 \\pi w R$. At zero external load ($P_{ext} = 0$), this adhesive force is the only load acting on the contact. It serves as a compressive load, $P$, in the Hertzian framework.\n\n$$P = P_{adhesion} = 2 \\pi w R$$\n\nWe substitute this load into the Hertz contact law:\n$$a^3 = \\frac{3 R P}{4 E^\\ast}$$\n\nFor the zero-load case in the DMT limit, this becomes:\n$$a_{\\mathrm{DMT},0}^3 = \\frac{3 R (2 \\pi w R)}{4 E^\\ast}$$\n\nSimplifying the expression, we obtain the cube of the DMT zero-load contact radius:\n$$a_{\\mathrm{DMT},0}^3 = \\frac{3 \\pi w R^2}{2 E^\\ast}$$\n\n**2. JKR-Limit Zero-Load Contact Radius ($a_{\\mathrm{JKR},0}$)**\n\nIn the Johnson–Kendall–Roberts (JKR) model, adhesive interactions are treated as surface energy effects acting at the edge of the contact area. The relationship between the applied load $P$ and the contact radius $a$ is given by the celebrated JKR equation:\n$$P(a) = \\frac{4 E^\\ast a^3}{3 R} - \\sqrt{8 \\pi w E^\\ast a^3}$$\n\nTo find the contact radius at zero external load, we set $P(a) = 0$:\n$$0 = \\frac{4 E^\\ast a_0^3}{3 R} - \\sqrt{8 \\pi w E^\\ast a_0^3}$$\n\nRearranging the terms, we get:\n$$\\frac{4 E^\\ast a_0^3}{3 R} = \\sqrt{8 \\pi w E^\\ast a_0^3}$$\n\nTo solve for $a_0$, we square both sides of the equation, assuming $a_0 \\neq 0$:\n$$\\left(\\frac{4 E^\\ast a_0^3}{3 R}\\right)^2 = 8 \\pi w E^\\ast a_0^3$$\n$$\\frac{16 (E^\\ast)^2 a_0^6}{9 R^2} = 8 \\pi w E^\\ast a_0^3$$\n\nWe divide both sides by $8 \\pi w E^\\ast a_0^3$ (this is valid as $E^\\ast > 0$, $w > 0$, and we are seeking a non-zero radius $a_0$):\n$$\\frac{2 E^\\ast a_0^3}{\\pi w \\cdot 9 R^2} = 1$$\n\nSolving for $a_0^3$, which we denote as $a_{\\mathrm{JKR},0}^3$:\n$$a_{\\mathrm{JKR},0}^3 = \\frac{9 \\pi w R^2}{2 E^\\ast}$$\n\nObserve that $a_{\\mathrm{JKR},0}^3 = 3 \\cdot a_{\\mathrm{DMT},0}^3$. This is a well-known result.\n\n**3. Asymptotically Matched Interpolation**\n\nThe problem provides a specific interpolation formula to bridge the DMT and JKR limits based on the Tabor parameter $\\mu$. The switching function $s(\\mu)$ is given by:\n$$s(\\mu) = \\left[ 1 + \\left( \\frac{\\mu_0}{\\mu} \\right)^k \\right]^{-1}$$\nWith the prescribed parameters $\\mu_0 = 1$ and $k = 3$, this becomes:\n$$s(\\mu) = \\left[ 1 + \\frac{1}{\\mu^3} \\right]^{-1} = \\left[ \\frac{\\mu^3 + 1}{\\mu^3} \\right]^{-1} = \\frac{\\mu^3}{1 + \\mu^3}$$\n\nThe interpolated radius $a_0(\\mu)$ is defined by:\n$$a_0(\\mu)^3 = a_{\\mathrm{DMT},0}^3 + s(\\mu) \\left( a_{\\mathrm{JKR},0}^3 - a_{\\mathrm{DMT},0}^3 \\right)$$\n\nSubstituting the expressions for the limiting radii and the switching function:\n$$a_0(\\mu)^3 = a_{\\mathrm{DMT},0}^3 + \\left( \\frac{\\mu^3}{1 + \\mu^3} \\right) \\left( 3 a_{\\mathrm{DMT},0}^3 - a_{\\mathrm{DMT},0}^3 \\right)$$\n$$a_0(\\mu)^3 = a_{\\mathrm{DMT},0}^3 \\left( 1 + \\frac{2 \\mu^3}{1 + \\mu^3} \\right)$$\n$$a_0(\\mu)^3 = a_{\\mathrm{DMT},0}^3 \\left( \\frac{1 + \\mu^3 + 2 \\mu^3}{1 + \\mu^3} \\right)$$\n$$a_0(\\mu)^3 = a_{\\mathrm{DMT},0}^3 \\left( \\frac{1 + 3\\mu^3}{1 + \\mu^3} \\right)$$\n\nFinally, substituting the full expression for $a_{\\mathrm{DMT},0}^3$:\n$$a_0(\\mu)^3 = \\left( \\frac{3 \\pi w R^2}{2 E^\\ast} \\right) \\left( \\frac{1 + 3\\mu^3}{1 + \\mu^3} \\right)$$\n\nThe zero-load contact radius $a_0(\\mu)$ is the cube root of this expression:\n$$a_0(\\mu) = \\left[ \\frac{3 \\pi w R^2}{2 E^\\ast} \\left( \\frac{1 + 3\\mu^3}{1 + \\mu^3} \\right) \\right]^{1/3}$$\n\nThis is the final formula to be implemented.\n\n**4. Implementation and Calculation**\n\nThe provided Python code will implement this final formula.

By analyzing the stability of the solutions, you will directly observe and quantify one of the most important predictions of the model: adhesive hysteresis. This advanced exercise provides an operational understanding of how the interplay between elasticity and adhesion gives rise to path-dependent phenomena like snap-in and hysteretic pull-off.", "problem": "You are asked to build a complete program that, for a fixed Tabor parameter equal to one, computes the adhesive sphere-on-flat contact radius as a function of applied load in the Maugis-Dugdale transition model and quantifies hysteresis between loading and unloading. Your task must start from fundamental definitions and laws, derive the governing equations to be solved numerically, and then implement a robust numerical solution.\n\nContext and modeling assumptions:\n- Consider a rigid sphere of radius $R$ indenting an isotropic, linear elastic half-space of plane strain modulus $E^\\ast$ (with $E^\\ast = E/(1-\\nu^2)$, where $E$ is the Young’s modulus and $\\nu$ the Poisson ratio). The indenter profile is $h(r) = r^2/(2R)$.\n- Adhesion is represented by a Dugdale cohesive zone: the tensile traction is constant and equal to $\\sigma_0$ within an annulus $a < r < c$ until a local separation of $z_0$ is reached, beyond which the traction is zero. The work of adhesion per unit area is $w = \\sigma_0 z_0$.\n- The Tabor parameter (also called the Maugis parameter) is defined as $\\mu = \\left( \\dfrac{R w^2}{E^{\\ast 2} z_0^3} \\right)^{1/3}$. For the Dugdale model with $w = \\sigma_0 z_0$, this becomes $\\mu = \\left( \\dfrac{R \\sigma_0^2}{E^{\\ast 2} z_0} \\right)^{1/3}$. You must impose $\\mu = 1$.\n- The total normal load $P$ balances the compressive Hertz-like contact inside $r \\le a$ and the tensile Dugdale traction in the annulus $a < r \\le c$.\n- The sphere approach $\\delta$ and the cohesive parameters $(a,c)$ must satisfy displacement compatibility at $r=a$ (no gap) and the Dugdale criterion at $r=c$ (gap equals $z_0$). Use the linear elastic axisymmetric Boussinesq solution for a half-space subjected to axisymmetric normal tractions. The result (after standard Abel-transform manipulations) can be organized in terms of the ratio $\\kappa = c/a > 1$ and monotone functions of $\\kappa$.\n\nFundamental starting points:\n- Linear elasticity superposition and the Boussinesq half-space response to axisymmetric loads.\n- The Hertzian, frictionless, non-adhesive normal contact solution for a sphere, which gives load scaling $P \\propto E^\\ast a^3 / R$ and approach scaling $\\delta \\propto a^2/R$.\n- The Dugdale cohesive zone idealization with constant tensile traction $\\sigma_0$ up to a cut-off separation $z_0$, and work of adhesion $w = \\sigma_0 z_0$.\n- The Tabor parameter definition above.\n\nDerive and use the following structure:\n- Define $\\kappa = c/a$, and show that the compatibility of elastic displacements and geometry between $r=a$ and $r=c$ implies a scalar monotone relation of the form\n  $$\n  z_0 \\;=\\; \\frac{2 \\sigma_0 a}{\\pi E^\\ast}\\,\\Big[\\,2\\kappa \\;-\\; (\\kappa^2-1)\\,\\ln\\!\\Big(\\frac{\\kappa+1}{\\kappa-1}\\Big)\\,\\Big],\n  $$\n  where the bracketed function of $\\kappa$ is strictly decreasing for $\\kappa \\in (1,\\infty)$, with $\\lim_{\\kappa\\to 1^+}[\\cdots] = 2$ and $\\lim_{\\kappa\\to\\infty}[\\cdots] = 0$.\n- Derive the total load as the superposition of the compressive Hertz-like contact and the tensile Dugdale annulus to obtain\n  $$\n  P \\;=\\; \\frac{4 E^\\ast a^3}{3 R} \\;-\\; \\pi \\sigma_0 a^2 \\left(\\kappa^2 - 1\\right).\n  $$\n- The Tabor condition $\\mu=1$ fixes $\\sigma_0$ in terms of $E^\\ast$, $R$, and $z_0$:\n  $$\n  \\sigma_0 \\;=\\; E^\\ast\\,\\sqrt{\\frac{z_0}{R}}.\n  $$\n- These relations define a parametric curve $P(a)$ via the intermediate variable $\\kappa$: for any admissible $a$ for which a $\\kappa>1$ solves the displacement equation, compute $P$ from the load equation.\n\nStability and hysteresis:\n- The quasi-static, force-controlled stable portions of the equilibrium curve satisfy $\\dfrac{dP}{da} > 0$. Portions with $\\dfrac{dP}{da} < 0$ are unstable.\n- Define the loading path as follows: starting from a detached state at sufficiently negative $P$, the system remains at $a=0$ until the equilibrium curve first becomes reachable and stable (snap-in), after which it follows the smallest stable $a$ for each $P$ as $P$ increases.\n- Define the unloading path as follows: starting from a high positive $P$ on the stable branch, as $P$ decreases, the system follows the largest stable $a$ for each $P$ until loss of stability (jump-out).\n\nNumerical task:\n1.

It requires the numerical solution of the Maugis-Dugdale model for an adhesive spherical contact under specific conditions. All provided parameters and equations are consistent with established theory. Therefore, a complete solution will be derived and implemented.\n\nThe objective is to compute the hysteretic response of an adhesive contact, characterized by the contact radius $a$, as a function of the applied normal load $P$. The model is that of a rigid sphere of radius $R$ indenting an elastic half-space with plane strain modulus $E^\\ast$. Adhesion is described by a Dugdale cohesive zone model with a constant tensile traction $\\sigma_0$ acting up to a critical separation $z_0$. The system is defined under the condition that the Tabor parameter $\\mu=1$.\n\nFirst, we establish the governing system of equations. The problem provides three key relations:\n\n$1$. Displacement compatibility at the edge of the cohesive zone ($r=c$) and the contact zone ($r=a$) yields an equation relating the parameter $\\kappa = c/a$ to the contact radius $a$ and material properties. This equation is given as:\n$$z_0 = \\frac{2 \\sigma_0 a}{\\pi E^\\ast} \\left[ 2\\kappa - (\\kappa^2 - 1) \\ln\\left(\\frac{\\kappa+1}{\\kappa-1}\\right) \\right]$$\nFor convenience, we define the dimensionless, monotonically decreasing function $g(\\kappa)$:\n$$g(\\kappa) = 2\\kappa - (\\kappa^2 - 1) \\ln\\left(\\frac{\\kappa+1}{\\kappa-1}\\right)$$\nThis function has the limits $\\lim_{\\kappa\\to 1^+} g(\\kappa) = 2$ and $\\lim_{\\kappa\\to\\infty} g(\\kappa) = 0$.\n\n$2$. The total applied load $P$ is the sum of the repulsive (Hertz-like) elastic force and the attractive adhesive force from the Dugdale zone:\n$$P(a, \\kappa) = \\frac{4 E^\\ast a^3}{3 R} - \\pi \\sigma_0 a^2 (\\kappa^2 - 1)$$\n\n$3$. The Tabor parameter is fixed at $\\mu=1$. Using its definition for the Dugdale model, $\\mu = \\left( \\frac{R \\sigma_0^2}{E^{\\ast 2} z_0} \\right)^{1/3} = 1$, we can express the cohesive stress $\\sigma_0$ in terms of the other system parameters:\n$$\\sigma_0^2 = \\frac{E^{\\ast 2} z_0}{R} \\implies \\sigma_0 = E^\\ast \\sqrt{\\frac{z_0}{R}}$$\n\nWe can now combine these equations to form a parametric description of the equilibrium curve $P(a)$. Substituting the expression for $\\sigma_0$ into the displacement compatibility equation gives:\n$$z_0 = \\frac{2 a}{\\pi E^\\ast} \\left( E^\\ast \\sqrt{\\frac{z_0}{R}} \\right) g(\\kappa) \\implies \\sqrt{z_0} = \\frac{2a}{\\pi\\sqrt{R}} g(\\kappa)$$\nThis can be rearranged to provide an equation for $\\kappa$ as a function of $a$:\n$$g(\\kappa) = \\frac{\\pi\\sqrt{R z_0}}{2a}$$\nSince $g(\\kappa)$ is defined on $(0, 2)$ for $\\kappa \\in (1, \\infty)$, a real solution for $\\kappa > 1$ exists only if $\\frac{\\pi\\sqrt{R z_0}}{2a}  2$. This condition establishes a minimum possible contact radius, $a_{\\mathrm{min}}$:\n$$a > \\frac{\\pi\\sqrt{R z_0}}{4} \\equiv a_{\\mathrm{min}}$$\nFor any given $a > a_{\\mathrm{min}}$, a unique $\\kappa$ can be found by numerically solving the nonlinear equation for $g(\\kappa)$.\n\nWith $\\kappa$ determined as a function of $a$, we can express the load $P$ solely as a function of $a$. Substituting the expression for $\\sigma_0$ into the load equation gives:\n$$P(a) = \\frac{4 E^\\ast a^3}{3 R} - \\pi \\left(E^\\ast \\sqrt{\\frac{z_0}{R}}\\right) a^2 (\\kappa(a)^2 - 1)$$\nThis equation defines the equilibrium curve $P(a)$ for all admissible $a > a_{\\mathrm{min}}$.\n\nThe stability of any equilibrium point $(a, P(a))$ is determined by the sign of the derivative $\\frac{dP}{da}$. A quasi-static, force-controlled process is stable only on segments of the curve where $\\frac{dP}{da} > 0$. The $P(a)$ curve for this system is typically S-shaped, exhibiting a region of instability ($\\frac{dP}{da}  0$) that separates two stable branches. This feature is the origin of hysteresis.\n\nThe numerical procedure is as follows:\n$1$. We compute the material constants $\\sigma_0$ and $a_{\\mathrm{min}}$ from the given parameters $R = 50 \\times 10^{-9}\\ \\mathrm{m}$, $E^\\ast = 100 \\times 10^{9}\\ \\mathrm{Pa}$, and $z_0 = 0.3 \\times 10^{-9}\\ \\mathrm{m}$.\n$2$. A dense grid of $a$ values is generated, starting from $a_{\\mathrm{min}}$ up to a sufficiently large value to encompass the loads of interest.\n$3$. For each $a$ in the grid, we solve the equation $g(\\kappa) = \\frac{\\pi\\sqrt{R z_0}}{2a}$ for $\\kappa$ using a numerical root-finder (e.g., the Brent-Dekker method).\n$4$. With the corresponding $\\kappa$ for each $a$, we compute the load $P(a)$, thus generating the full equilibrium curve.\n$5$. The derivative $\\frac{dP}{da}$ is computed numerically along the curve (e.g., using finite differences).\n$6$. The curve is partitioned into stable branches where $\\frac{dP}{da} > 0$. This typically yields a lower branch (smaller $a$) and an upper branch (larger $a$).\n$7$. For each test load $P_i$, we find all stable contact radii by finding the intersections of the line $P=P_i$ with the stable branches. This is best achieved by inverting the relationship and interpolating $a(P)$ on each monotonic stable branch.\n$8$. If stable solutions $\\{a_1, a_2, \\dots\\}$ exist for a given $P_i$, the loading radius is defined as $a_{\\mathrm{load}}(P_i) = \\min(\\{a_1, a_2, \\dots\\})$ and the unloading radius as $a_{\\mathrm{unload}}(P_i) = \\max(\\{a_1, a_2, \\dots\\})$. If no stable solutions exist, both are taken to be $0$.\n$9$. Finally, the hysteresis magnitude is calculated as $\\Delta a(P_i) = a_{\\mathrm{unload}}(P_i) - a_{\\mathrm{load}}(P_i)$.
