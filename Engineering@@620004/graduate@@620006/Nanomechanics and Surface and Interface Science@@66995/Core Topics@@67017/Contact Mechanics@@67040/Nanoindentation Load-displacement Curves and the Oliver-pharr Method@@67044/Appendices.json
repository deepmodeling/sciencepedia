The provided data are idealized to perfectly fit the specified power-law models, which allows for a direct analytical solution without numerical fitting. The problem statement adheres to the principles of nanomechanics and poses a standard analysis task based on the Oliver-Pharr method.\n\nThe solution proceeds by sequentially addressing the stated tasks. All calculations will use the provided units of nanoameters ($nm$) for displacement and millinewtons ($mN$) for load. Consequently, work will be expressed in units of $mN \\cdot nm$.\n\nFirst, we determine the parameters of the unloading curve, which is given by the power-law relation $P(h)=A\\,(h-h_f)^{m}$. We are given four data points on the unloading segment: $(h_1, P_1) = (200, 5.000)$, $(h_2, P_2) = (180, 2.22222)$, $(h_3, P_3) = (160, 0.555556)$, and $(h_4, P_4) = (150, 0.138889)$. Let's represent the fractional parts as rational numbers for precision: $P_2 = 20/9$, $P_3 = 5/9$, and $P_4 = 5/36$.\n\nWe can form ratios of the loads to eliminate the constant $A$:\n$$ \\frac{P_2}{P_3} = \\frac{A(h_2-h_f)^m}{A(h_3-h_f)^m} = \\left(\\frac{180-h_f}{160-h_f}\\right)^m $$\n$$ \\frac{P_3}{P_4} = \\frac{A(h_3-h_f)^m}{A(h_4-h_f)^m} = \\left(\\frac{160-h_f}{150-h_f}\\right)^m $$\nNumerically, these ratios are:\n$$ \\frac{P_2}{P_3} = \\frac{20/9}{5/9} = 4 $$\n$$ \\frac{P_3}{P_4} = \\frac{5/9}{5/36} = 4 $$\nSince both ratios equal $4$, we can equate their bases:\n$$ \\frac{180-h_f}{160-h_f} = \\frac{160-h_f}{150-h_f} $$\nThis leads to the equation $(180-h_f)(150-h_f) = (160-h_f)^2$. Expanding both sides gives:\n$$ 27000 - 150h_f - 180h_f + h_f^2 = 25600 - 320h_f + h_f^2 $$\n$$ 27000 - 330h_f = 25600 - 320h_f $$\n$$ 1400 = 10h_f \\implies h_f = 140 \\, \\text{nm} $$\nNow, we determine the exponent $m$ using one of the ratios:\n$$ \\left(\\frac{180-140}{160-140}\\right)^m = \\left(\\frac{40}{20}\\right)^m = 2^m = 4 $$\nThis gives $m=2$.\nFinally, we find the constant $A$ using the maximum load point $(h_{\\max}, P_{\\max}) = (200, 5)$:\n$$ 5 = A(200-140)^2 = A(60)^2 = 3600 A $$\n$$ A = \\frac{5}{3600} = \\frac{1}{720} \\, \\text{mN/nm}^2 $$\nThe parameters for the unloading curve are $m=2$, $h_f=140 \\, \\text{nm}$, and $A=1/720 \\, \\text{mN/nm}^2$.\n\nSecond, we compute the elastically recoverable work, $W_{\\text{el}}$. This is the area under the unloading curve from the final depth $h_f$ to the maximum depth $h_{\\max}$:\n$$ W_{\\text{el}} = \\int_{h_f}^{h_{\\max}} P(h)\\,\\mathrm{d}h = \\int_{140}^{200} \\frac{1}{720} (h-140)^2 \\,\\mathrm{d}h $$\nWe perform a substitution $u = h-140$, $\\mathrm{d}u=\\mathrm{d}h$. The new limits of integration are from $u=140-140=0$ to $u=200-140=60$.\n$$ W_{\\text{el}} = \\frac{1}{720} \\int_{0}^{60} u^2 \\,\\mathrm{d}u = \\frac{1}{720} \\left[ \\frac{u^3}{3} \\right]_0^{60} = \\frac{1}{720} \\frac{60^3}{3} = \\frac{216000}{2160} = 100 \\, \\text{mN}\\cdot\\text{nm} $$\n\nThird, we determine the loading law $P(h)=k\\,h^{n}$ and compute the total work of indentation, $W_{\\text{tot}}$. We use the loading data, for instance, $(40, 0.200)$ and $(80, 0.800)$.\nTaking the ratio of loads:\n$$ \\frac{P(80)}{P(40)} = \\frac{k \\cdot 80^n}{k \\cdot 40^n} = \\left(\\frac{80}{40}\\right)^n = 2^n $$\nNumerically, this ratio is $0.800/0.200 = 4$. So, $2^n=4$, which implies $n=2$. This exponent is characteristic of an ideal pyramidal indenter.\nNow, we find the constant $k$ using the point $(40, 0.200)$:\n$$ 0.200 = k (40)^2 = 1600 k $$\n$$ k = \\frac{0.2}{1600} = \\frac{2}{16000} = \\frac{1}{8000} \\, \\text{mN/nm}^2 $$\nThe loading law is $P(h) = \\frac{1}{8000}h^2$. The total work is the integral of the loading curve from $0$ to $h_{\\max}=200 \\, \\text{nm}$:\n$$ W_{\\text{tot}} = \\int_{0}^{h_{\\max}} P(h)\\,\\mathrm{d}h = \\int_{0}^{200} \\frac{1}{8000} h^2 \\,\\mathrm{d}h $$\n$$ W_{\\text{tot}} = \\frac{1}{8000} \\left[ \\frac{h^3}{3} \\right]_0^{200} = \\frac{1}{8000} \\frac{200^3}{3} = \\frac{8000000}{24000} = \\frac{1000}{3} \\, \\text{mN}\\cdot\\text{nm} $$\n\nFourth, we compute the elastic recovery ratio $W_{\\text{el}}/W_{\\text{tot}}$:\n$$ \\frac{W_{\\text{el}}}{W_{\\text{tot}}} = \\frac{100}{1000/3} = \\frac{300}{1000} = 0.3 $$\nRounding to four significant figures as required, the ratio is $0.3000$.\n\nBrief commentary: The unloading exponent $m=2$ is consistent with the predominantly plastic response indicated by the low recovery ratio of $W_{\\text{el}}/W_{\\text{tot}} = 0.3$. In general, the recovery ratio can be expressed as $\\frac{W_{\\text{el}}}{W_{\\text{tot}}} = \\frac{n+1}{m+1} (1 - \\frac{h_f}{h_{\\max}})$. For this problem, both loading and unloading exponents are $n=m=2$, simplifying the ratio to $1 - h_f/h_{\\max}$. The final depth $h_f=140 \\, \\text{nm}$ is $70\\%$ of the maximum depth $h_{\\max}=200 \\, \\text{nm}$, indicating that a large portion of the deformation is plastic (permanent). The computed ratio of $0.3$ ($30\\%$ elastic recovery) directly reflects this significant plastic deformation. While an exponent of $m=2$ is theoretically associated with a flat punch geometry and is higher than typically measured for sharp pyramidal indenters (where $m \\approx 1.2-1.6$), its value here provides a quantitative description of the unloading curve shape that, upon integration, yields an elastic work consistent with the observed high degree of plasticity. A higher value of $m$ for a given degree of plasticity ($h_f/h_{\\max}$) leads to a lower elastic recovery ratio, thus quantitatively reinforcing the observation of a plastic-dominant response.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.3000}$$", "id": "2780692"}, {"introduction": "While idealized models provide a clear framework, real-world nanoindentation data are invariably affected by instrumental artifacts like thermal drift and load-frame compliance. This practice challenges you to think like an experimentalist by considering the ideal case of a purely elastic indentation, where no energy is dissipated and the indentation should be fully recoverable. By understanding why the residual depth $h_f$ must be zero for such a material, you can develop a robust strategy to identify and correct for these instrumental errors, ensuring the accuracy of your measurements [@problem_id:2780630].", "problem": "A rigid pyramidal indenter with a sufficiently large tip radius indents a single-crystal elastic half-space under displacement control. Assume small strains, linear elasticity, non-adhesive frictionless contact, and that the material response is purely elastic over the explored load range. The instrument has two non-idealities: a constant thermal drift rate $v_d$ in the displacement channel and a finite load-frame compliance $C_f$ in series with the sample contact. An analyst intends to use the Oliver–Pharr (OP) method (Oliver–Pharr) to extract elastic modulus from the unloading stiffness and therefore wishes to validate both drift correction and compliance calibration using an elastic standard.\n\nFrom first principles of conservative elasticity and basic series-compliance reasoning, determine which protocol correctly explains why the residual depth $h_f$ must vanish for a purely elastic contact and outlines a sound validation strategy for drift and compliance corrections.\n\nWhich option is most correct?\n\nA. Because purely elastic indentation is conservative and the load–displacement relation $P(h)$ is a single-valued, history-independent function with $P(h) > 0$ for all $h > 0$ and $P(0)=0$, unloading to $P=0$ necessarily implies $h=0$, so $h_f=0$. With a constant drift rate $v_d$, the measured depth is $h_{\\mathrm{meas}}(t)=h_{\\mathrm{true}}(t)+v_d t + h_0$, so at the end of a test of duration $T$ a nonzero measured $h_f$ equals $v_d T$; subtracting $v_d t$ from the time series should collapse $h_f$ to $0$ across tests with different $T$. For compliance, series addition gives $d h_{\\mathrm{meas}}/dP = d h_{\\mathrm{true}}/dP + C_f$, hence $1/S_{\\mathrm{meas}} = 1/S_{\\mathrm{true}} + C_f$. For a non-adhesive elastic contact with $P=K h^m$ (e.g., Hertzian with $m=3/2$), $1/S_{\\mathrm{true}} \\propto h^{1-m}$, so a plot of $1/S_{\\mathrm{meas}}$ versus $h_u^{1-m}$ (with $h_u$ the depth at the start of unloading) must be linear with intercept $C_f$. Agreement of the intercept with the calibrated $C_f$ and $h_f \\approx 0$ after drift correction validate both corrections.\n\nB. In a purely elastic contact, geometric nonlinearity produces unloading hysteresis even without dissipation, so $h_f \\gt 0$ is expected. Therefore $h_f$ should be used to calibrate the contact area function rather than drift; compliance cannot be inferred from stiffness–depth scaling.\n\nC. Compliance is validated by requiring $h_{\\max} \\propto P_{\\max}$ in the elastic regime; any deviation from this linear proportionality implies drift. A nonzero $h_f$ is an unavoidable consequence of nonlinear stiffness and should not be corrected.\n\nD. Because unloading stiffness is finite, $h_f$ scales as $P_{\\max}^{1/2}$ even for a purely elastic contact; therefore drift corrections are unnecessary if a single pre-test baseline segment is recorded, and compliance should be taken as negligible when $S_{\\mathrm{meas}}$ increases with load.\n\nE. A nonzero $h_f$ on an elastic standard primarily indicates a miscalibrated $C_f$ because frame compliance stores elastic energy that cannot be fully recovered during unloading; thus the correct action is to increase $C_f$ until $h_f$ vanishes, without relying on stiffness–depth scaling or time-based drift estimation.", "solution": "The supplied problem statement is subjected to rigorous validation.\n\n**Step 1: Extract Givens**\n- **Indenter**: Rigid pyramidal indenter with a sufficiently large tip radius.\n- **Sample**: Single-crystal elastic half-space.\n- **Control Mode**: Displacement control.\n- **Assumptions**: Small strains, linear elasticity, non-adhesive frictionless contact, and a purely elastic material response over the explored load range.\n- **Instrumental Artifacts**: A constant thermal drift rate, $v_d$, and a finite load-frame compliance, $C_f$.\n- **Objective**: To validate drift and compliance corrections using an elastic standard, based on the principle that the residual depth $h_f$ must be zero for a purely elastic contact.\n\n**Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens**\n- **Scientific Grounding**: The problem is well-grounded in the established theory of contact mechanics and the practical application of nanoindentation, specifically the Oliver-Pharr method.

It represents a valid and non-trivial question in experimental mechanics. Therefore, a full solution will be derived.\n\n**Derivation from First Principles**\n\nThe problem demands an explanation for why the residual depth, $h_f$, must be zero for a purely elastic contact and a corresponding validation protocol for instrumental artifacts.\n\n1.  **The Nature of Purely Elastic Contact**: The problem stipulates that the material response is \"purely elastic\". In the context of mechanics and thermodynamics, an elastic process is, by definition, a reversible process. This means that no energy is dissipated in the form of heat, plastic deformation, or other irreversible mechanisms. The work done on the sample during the loading phase, $W_{\\text{in}}$, must be entirely recovered as work done by the sample during the unloading phase, $W_{\\text{out}}$.\n    Mathematically, the work done is the integral of the load, $P$, with respect to the displacement, $h$:\n    $$W_{\\text{in}} = \\int_{0}^{h_{\\max}} P_{\\text{load}}(h) dh$$\n    $$W_{\\text{out}} = \\int_{h_f}^{h_{\\max}} P_{\\text{unload}}(h) dh$$\n    For a conservative (purely elastic) system, the net work over a full cycle must be zero, implying $W_{\\text{in}} = W_{\\text{out}}$. This equality can only be satisfied if the loading and unloading paths are identical, i.e., $P_{\\text{load}}(h) = P_{\\text{unload}}(h)$ for all $h$. The load-displacement function $P(h)$ must be single-valued. Consequently, if the system is unloaded to zero load ($P=0$), the displacement must return to its initial value, which is zero. Therefore, for an ideal, purely elastic contact, the final (residual) depth $h_f$ must be zero:\n    $$h_f = 0$$\n    Any hysteresis (a loop in the $P-h$ curve) is a signature of energy dissipation and is inconsistent with a purely elastic response.\n\n2.  **Validation of Instrumental Corrections**: The instrument is not ideal and has two specified non-idealities: thermal drift and frame compliance.\n\n    -   **Thermal Drift ($v_d$)**: Thermal drift adds a time-dependent component to the measured displacement. For a constant drift rate $v_d$, the measured displacement $h_{\\text{meas}}$ at time $t$ is related to the true displacement $h_{\\text{true}}$ by:\n        $$h_{\\text{meas}}(t) = h_{\\text{true}}(t) + v_d t + h_0$$\n        where $h_0$ is an initial offset. A full indentation test takes a total duration $T$. At the end of the test ($t = T$), the load is zero, so the true displacement must be the true final depth, $h_{f, \\text{true}}$. For our elastic standard, $h_{f, \\text{true}} = 0$. The measured final depth is therefore:\n        $$h_{f, \\text{meas}} = h_{f, \\text{true}} + v_d T + h_0' = v_d T + h_0'$$\n        where $h_0'$ accounts for the initial tare. The change in depth from the start of the test to the end is thus $v_d T$. A non-zero measured final depth on a purely elastic standard is a direct measure of the total drift during the test. To validate a drift correction, one must show that after applying the correction $h_{\\text{corr}}(t) = h_{\\text{meas}}(t) - v_d t$, the resulting final depth $h_{f, \\text{corr}}$ is zero (or negligible), regardless of the total test time $T$.\n\n    -   **Frame Compliance ($C_f$)**: The total measured displacement, $h_{\\text{meas}}$, is the sum of the true indentation depth into the sample, $h_{\\text{true}}$, and the elastic deformation of the instrument's load frame, $h_{\\text{frame}}$. The frame is modeled as a spring in series with the contact, so its displacement is $h_{\\text{frame}} = C_f P$.\n        $$h_{\\text{meas}} = h_{\\text{true}} + C_f P$$\n        The quantity of interest for a modulus measurement is the unloading stiffness, $S = dP/dh$. The measured stiffness is $S_{\\text{meas}} = dP/dh_{\\text{meas}}$, while the true contact stiffness is $S_{\\text{true}} = dP/dh_{\\text{true}}$. By differentiating the displacement relation with respect to $P$, we find the relationship between the compliances ($1/S$):\n        $$\\frac{dh_{\\text{meas}}}{dP} = \\frac{dh_{\\text{true}}}{dP} + \\frac{d(C_f P)}{dP}$$\n        $$\\frac{1}{S_{\\text{meas}}} = \\frac{1}{S_{\\text{true}}} + C_f$$\n        This series-compliance relationship is the basis for calibrating $C_f$. For a generic elastic contact, the load-depth relation is often a power law, $P = K h_{\\text{true}}^m$, where the exponent $m$ depends on the indenter geometry ($m=3/2$ for a sphere, $m=2$ for a perfect cone/pyramid). The true stiffness is then $S_{\\text{true}} = dP/dh_{\\text{true}} = m K h_{\\text{true}}^{m-1}$. The true compliance is thus $1/S_{\\text{true}} \\propto h_{\\text{true}}^{1-m}$. By performing indentations to a range of maximum depths ($h_u$, the depth at the start of unloading), one can vary $S_{\\text{true}}$. A plot of the measured compliance, $1/S_{\\text{meas}}$, versus a term proportional to the true compliance, such as $h_u^{1-m}$, should be linear. The intercept of this plot at $h_u \\to \\infty$ (where $h_u^{1-m} \\to 0$ for $m>1$) corresponds to the case of infinite true stiffness ($S_{\\text{true}} \\to \\infty$, so $1/S_{\\text{true}} \\to 0$), leaving only the frame compliance:\n        $$\\lim_{h_u \\to \\infty} \\left(\\frac{1}{S_{\\text{meas}}}\\right) = C_f$$\n        This provides a robust method for determining $C_f$.\n\nA sound validation strategy combines these points.\n\n**Option-by-Option Analysis**\n\n**A.** This option states that for a purely elastic contact, the system is conservative, $P(h)$ is single-valued, and thus $h_f=0$. It correctly identifies that a measured $h_f$ arises from thermal drift ($h_f = v_d T$) and that a time-based correction should make $h_f$ vanish. It then correctly derives the series-compliance relation $1/S_{\\text{meas}} = 1/S_{\\text{true}} + C_f$ and outlines the standard procedure for finding $C_f$ by plotting $1/S_{\\text{meas}}$ versus a depth-dependent term ($h_u^{1-m}$) and taking the intercept. The conclusion that agreement on $C_f$ and $h_f \\approx 0$ after drift correction validates the corrections is perfectly sound.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B.** This option incorrectly claims that geometric nonlinearity causes hysteresis and $h_f > 0$ even for an elastic contact. This violates the definition of an elastic (conservative) mechanical system. Hysteresis implies energy dissipation. The foundation of this option is physically incorrect.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C.** This option incorrectly suggests that $h_{\\max} \\propto P_{\\max}$ for elastic contact, which is only true for a flat punch, not a pyramidal or spherical indenter. It also wrongly attributes deviation from this incorrect linearity to drift. Finally, it repeats the error of claiming a nonzero $h_f$ is an unavoidable consequence of nonlinear stiffness.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D.** This option incorrectly claims that $h_f$ scales with $P_{\\max}^{1/2}$ for an elastic contact; $h_f$ must be zero. It incorrectly suggests that a single pre-test baseline is sufficient for drift correction, ignoring drift during the test. It also makes the false claim that compliance is negligible when $S_{\\text{meas}}$ increases with load; in fact, this is precisely the regime where compliance effects become most important.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**E.** This option incorrectly attributes a non-zero $h_f$ to frame compliance ($C_f$). Frame compliance is an elastic effect and does not cause a residual offset at zero load. The proposed \"correction\" of adjusting $C_f$ to make $h_f$ vanish is physically baseless and methodologically unsound. It advocates for ignoring the correct, physically-based validation methods.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\nOnly option A provides a description that is consistent with the fundamental principles of mechanics and the standard, accepted methodology in the field of nanoindentation.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2780630"}, {"introduction": "Beyond analyzing a single indentation, nanomechanics often involves probing how material properties change with the length scale of deformation.

It is based on established principles of nanomechanics, specifically the Oliver-Pharr method for hardness measurement and the Nix-Gao model for the indentation size effect. All data and conditions necessary for a unique solution are provided, and there are no internal contradictions, factual errors, or ambiguities.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. A solution will be provided.\n\n**Derivation and Solution**\n\nThe Nix–Gao model explains the indentation size effect by considering the role of geometrically necessary dislocations (GNDs) in addition to statistically stored dislocations (SSDs). The starting point is the Taylor hardening law, which relates the shear flow stress, $\\tau$, to the total dislocation density, $\\rho_{total}$:\n$$\n\\tau = \\alpha G b \\sqrt{\\rho_{total}}\n$$\nwhere $\\alpha$ is a constant on the order of $0.3-0.5$, $G$ is the shear modulus, and $b$ is the magnitude of the Burgers vector. The total dislocation density is the sum of the SSD density, $\\rho_S$, and the GND density, $\\rho_G$:\n$$\n\\rho_{total} = \\rho_S + \\rho_G\n$$\nThe hardness, $H$, is taken to be proportional to the tensile flow stress, $\\sigma$, which in turn is related to the shear stress by the Taylor factor, $M$. Thus, $H = C \\sigma = C M \\tau$, where $C$ is a constraint factor (approximately $3$). Combining these relations gives:\n$$\nH = C M \\alpha G b \\sqrt{\\rho_S + \\rho_G}\n$$\nSquaring this equation yields:\n$$\nH^2 = (C M \\alpha G b)^2 (\\rho_S + \\rho_G)\n$$\nIn the limit of a very large indentation depth ($h_c \\rightarrow \\infty$), the plastic strain gradients become negligible, and thus the density of GNDs approaches zero ($\\rho_G \\rightarrow 0$). In this limit, the hardness approaches the macroscopic, depth-independent hardness, $H_0$. This hardness is determined solely by the density of SSDs:\n$$\nH_0^2 = (C M \\alpha G b)^2 \\rho_S\n$$\nSubstituting this back into the equation for $H^2$ gives:\n$$\nH^2 = H_0^2 + (C M \\alpha G b)^2 \\rho_G\n$$\nFor a sharp pyramidal indent, the density of GNDs required to accommodate the plastic strain gradient is shown to be inversely proportional to the indentation contact depth, $h_c$:\n$$\n\\rho_G = \\frac{\\bar{\\rho}_G}{h_c}\n$$\nwhere $\\bar{\\rho}_G$ is a term that depends on the indenter geometry. Substituting this into the hardness equation gives:\n$$\nH^2 = H_0^2 + \\frac{(C M \\alpha G b)^2 \\bar{\\rho}_G}{h_c}\n$$\nThis equation can be rewritten in the canonical Nix–Gao form by defining a characteristic length, $h^*$:\n$$\nh^* \\equiv \\frac{(C M \\alpha G b)^2 \\bar{\\rho}_G}{H_0^2}\n$$\nThe substitution of this definition yields the final relation:\n$$\nH^2 = H_0^2 + H_0^2 \\frac{h^*}{h_c} \\quad \\text{or} \\quad H^2 = H_0^2 \\left(1 + \\frac{h^*}{h_c}\\right)\n$$\nThis equation is linear in the form $y = C_{int} + m \\cdot x$, where we identify the variables as $y = H^2$ and $x = 1/h_c$. The intercept is $C_{int} = H_0^2$ and the slope is $m = H_0^2 h^*$.\n\nTo find the parameters $H_0$ and $h^*$, we perform a linear regression on the provided data by plotting $H^2$ against $1/h_c$. First, the data is transformed:\n- ($h_c=25\\ \\text{nm}$, $H=8.94427\\ \\text{GPa}$) $\\rightarrow$ ($1/h_c=0.04\\ \\text{nm}^{-1}$, $H^2=80.000\\ \\text{GPa}^2$)\n- ($h_c=50\\ \\text{nm}$, $H=6.92820\\ \\text{GPa}$) $\\rightarrow$ ($1/h_c=0.02\\ \\text{nm}^{-1}$, $H^2=48.000\\ \\text{GPa}^2$)\n- ($h_c=100\\ \\text{nm}$, $H=5.65685\\ \\text{GPa}$) $\\rightarrow$ ($1/h_c=0.01\\ \\text{nm}^{-1}$, $H^2=32.000\\ \\text{GPa}^2$)\n- ($h_c=150\\ \\text{nm}$, $H=5.16398\\ \\text{GPa}$) $\\rightarrow$ ($1/h_c \\approx 0.006667\\ \\text{nm}^{-1}$, $H^2=26.667\\ \\text{GPa}^2$)\n- ($h_c=200\\ \\text{nm}$, $H=4.89898\\ \\text{GPa}$) $\\rightarrow$ ($1/h_c=0.005\\ \\text{nm}^{-1}$, $H^2=24.000\\ \\text{GPa}^2$)\n- ($h_c=300\\ \\text{nm}$, $H=4.61880\\ \\text{GPa}$) $\\rightarrow$ ($1/h_c \\approx 0.003333\\ \\text{nm}^{-1}$, $H^2=21.333\\ \\text{GPa}^2$)\n- ($h_c=400\\ \\text{nm}$, $H=4.47214\\ \\text{GPa}$) $\\rightarrow$ ($1/h_c=0.0025\\ \\text{nm}^{-1}$, $H^2=20.000\\ \\text{GPa}^2$)\n- ($h_c=600\\ \\text{nm}$, $H=4.32049\\ \\text{GPa}$) $\\rightarrow$ ($1/h_c \\approx 0.001667\\ \\text{nm}^{-1}$, $H^2=18.667\\ \\text{GPa}^2$)\n\nUpon inspection, the data perfectly conforms to the linear equation $H^2 = 16 + 1600 \\cdot (1/h_c)$. Therefore, a formal least-squares regression is unnecessary as the fit is exact. We can directly identify the intercept and slope from this equation.\n\nThe intercept on the $H^2$ axis (where $1/h_c \\rightarrow 0$) is $C_{int} = H_0^2$:\n$$\nH_0^2 = 16 \\text{ GPa}^2 \\implies H_0 = \\sqrt{16} \\text{ GPa} = 4 \\text{ GPa}\n$$\nThe slope of the line is $m = H_0^2 h^*$:\n$$\nH_0^2 h^* = 1600 \\text{ GPa}^2 \\cdot \\text{nm}\n$$\nWe can solve for the characteristic length $h^*$:\n$$\nh^* = \\frac{1600 \\text{ GPa}^2 \\cdot \\text{nm}}{H_0^2} = \\frac{1600 \\text{ GPa}^2 \\cdot \\text{nm}}{16 \\text{ GPa}^2} = 100 \\text{ nm}\n$$\nThe problem requires rounding to four significant figures.\nThus, $H_0 = 4.000 \\text{ GPa}$ and $h^* = 100.0 \\text{ nm}$.\n\n**Physical Meaning of Parameters**\n\n$H_0$: This parameter represents the macroscopic hardness, or the hardness of the material in the absence of size effects. It is the value that would be measured at a very large indentation depth ($h_c \\gg h^*$), where the contribution of geometrically necessary dislocations becomes negligible. This value is determined by the material's intrinsic resistance to plastic deformation, governed by its microstructure and the density of statistically stored dislocations, $\\rho_S$. It is equivalent to the hardness measured in a conventional microhardness or macrohardness test.\n\n$h^*$: This parameter is a characteristic length scale that quantifies the magnitude of the indentation size effect for a given material and indenter geometry. It represents the depth scale at which the hardening contribution from GNDs becomes comparable to the intrinsic hardening from SSDs. A material with a larger $h^*$ will exhibit a more pronounced increase in hardness at shallow indentation depths. The parameter $h^*$ is a composite material property, as it depends on the shear modulus, Burgers vector, Taylor factor, and the indenter geometry.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n4.000 & 100.0\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "2780650"}]}
