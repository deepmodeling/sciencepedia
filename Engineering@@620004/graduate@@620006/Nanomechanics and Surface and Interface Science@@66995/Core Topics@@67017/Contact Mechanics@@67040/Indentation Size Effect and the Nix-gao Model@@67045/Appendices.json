This practice focuses on a vital task in scientific analysis: choosing the correct way to visualize and linearize data to validate a model. By comparing different plotting schemes for indentation data [@problem_id:2774825], you will learn why plotting hardness squared, $H^2$, versus reciprocal depth, $1/h$, is not merely a convention but a necessary choice dictated by the mathematical structure of the Nix-Gao model.", "problem": "In instrumented indentation of a face-centered cubic metal with negligible oxide, you measure the indentation hardness $H$ as a function of contact depth $h$ over a range that spans the onset and attenuation of the indentation size effect. You wish to test whether the data are consistent with a size-effect model in which the depth dependence arises from an additional hardening contribution that scales with a strain gradient and diminishes with increasing $h$, while the material approaches a finite bulk hardness at large $h$. Two plotting strategies are considered: a log-log plot of $H$ versus $h$, and a plot of $H^2$ versus $1/h$. Which statement best explains how the log-log plot can mislead the interpretation of scaling laws in this context, and justifies which representation is preferable for testing the Nix–Gao model?\n\nA. Because the model’s depth dependence adds to a finite baseline rather than following a pure power law, a log-log plot of $H$ versus $h$ can show an apparent straight line only over a limited range and yield a spurious “exponent,” whereas plotting $H^2$ versus $1/h$ directly linearizes the model, yielding a nonzero intercept that reflects the bulk hardness and a slope that quantifies an intrinsic length scale. Therefore, $H^2$ versus $1/h$ is the preferable representation.\n\nB. A log-log plot is universally superior because it homogenizes variance and removes additive constants, so it always provides the correct scaling exponent and intercept for any depth-dependent hardness model; by contrast, $H^2$ versus $1/h$ hides the bulk hardness and cannot be used to extract a characteristic length. Therefore, $H$ versus $h$ on log-log axes is preferable.\n\nC. Both the log-log plot of $H$ versus $h$ and the plot of $H^2$ versus $1/h$ are equivalent diagnostics; if the model is correct, both representations will be linear with identical slopes and intercepts, so the choice of representation does not affect interpretation.\n\nD. A plot of $H$ versus $1/h$ is preferable because squaring $H$ only amplifies measurement noise without any physical justification; the correct test of the model is linearity of $H$ with $1/h$, not of $H^2$ with $1/h$.", "solution": "The problem asks for an evaluation of two graphical methods for testing the validity of the Nix-Gao model for the indentation size effect, a phenomenon observed in the instrumented indentation of crystalline materials. The model posits a specific relationship between indentation hardness, $H$, and indentation depth, $h$.\n\nFirst, we must establish the mathematical form of the Nix-Gao model from first principles. The model is based on the idea that plastic deformation under the indenter is accommodated by two types of dislocations: statistically stored dislocations (SSDs) with density $\\rho_S$, which are inherent to the material's bulk state, and geometrically necessary dislocations (GNDs) with density $\\rho_G$, which are required to maintain the contiguity of the crystal lattice under the strain gradients imposed by the indenter.\n\nThe total dislocation density is $\\rho_T = \\rho_S + \\rho_G$.\n\nAccording to the Taylor hardening law, the flow stress $\\sigma$ of the material is related to the total dislocation density by:\n$$ \\sigma = M \\alpha G b \\sqrt{\\rho_T} = M \\alpha G b \\sqrt{\\rho_S + \\rho_G} $$\nwhere $M$ is the Taylor factor, $\\alpha$ is a geometric constant on the order of $0.5$, $G$ is the shear modulus, and $b$ is the magnitude of the Burgers vector.\n\nThe indentation hardness $H$ is considered to be proportional to the flow stress, typically $H \\approx C \\sigma$, where $C$ is a constraint factor often taken to be around $3$. Thus:\n$$ H = C M \\alpha G b \\sqrt{\\rho_S + \\rho_G} $$\nLet us define the bulk hardness, $H_0$, as the hardness at infinite depth ($h \\to \\infty$), where the contribution from GNDs vanishes ($\\rho_G \\to 0$). In this limit, the hardness is determined solely by the SSDs:\n$$ H_0 = C M \\alpha G b \\sqrt{\\rho_S} $$\nSubstituting this definition back into the main equation for $H$, we can write:\n$$ H = \\frac{H_0}{\\sqrt{\\rho_S}} \\sqrt{\\rho_S + \\rho_G} = H_0 \\sqrt{1 + \\frac{\\rho_G}{\\rho_S}} $$\nThe core insight of the Nix-Gao model is to relate the GND density $\\rho_G$ to the indentation depth $h$. For a conical or pyramidal indenter, this relationship is found to be:\n$$ \\rho_G \\propto \\frac{1}{h} $$\nMore specifically, $\\rho_G = \\frac{3 \\tan^2\\theta}{2 b h}$, where $\\theta$ is the angle between the indenter face and the sample surface. Incorporating this into our hardness equation, we have:\n$$ H = H_0 \\sqrt{1 + \\frac{h^*}{h}} $$\nwhere $h^*$ is a characteristic length scale that amalgamates the material properties and geometric factors, i.e., $h^* \\propto 1/\\rho_S$. This is the canonical form of the Nix-Gao model.\n\nNow, we evaluate the two proposed plotting strategies.\n\nStrategy 1: Plot of $H^2$ versus $1/h$.\nLet us square the Nix-Gao equation:\n$$ H^2 = H_0^2 \\left(1 + \\frac{h^*}{h}\\right) $$\n$$ H^2 = H_0^2 + (H_0^2 h^*) \\frac{1}{h} $$\nThis equation is in the form of a linear equation $y = c + m x$, where:\n- $y = H^2$\n- $x = 1/h$\n- The y-intercept is $c = H_0^2$\n- The slope is $m = H_0^2 h^*$\n\nTherefore, if the experimental data ($H$, $h$) conform to the Nix-Gao model, a plot of $H^2$ versus $1/h$ will yield a straight line. From the intercept of this line, one can directly determine the bulk hardness $H_0 = \\sqrt{c}$. From the slope, one can determine the characteristic length scale $h^* = m/c = m/H_0^2$. This plotting method provides a direct, linear test of the model's validity and allows for the straightforward extraction of the model's two key parameters, $H_0$ and $h^*$.\n\nStrategy 2: Log-log plot of $H$ versus $h$.\nThis strategy involves plotting $\\log(H)$ versus $\\log(h)$. Taking the logarithm of the Nix-Gao equation gives:\n$$ \\log(H) = \\log\\left(H_0 \\sqrt{1 + \\frac{h^*}{h}}\\right) = \\log(H_0) + \\frac{1}{2}\\log\\left(1 + \\frac{h^*}{h}\\right) $$\nThis is fundamentally **not** a linear relationship between $\\log(H)$ and $\\log(h)$. A log-log plot is only linear for pure power-law relationships of the form $H = A h^n$, where $\\log(H) = \\log(A) + n\\log(h)$. The Nix-Gao model is an **additive** model (specifically, hardness-squared is additive), not a pure power law.\n\nLet us examine the limiting behaviors on a log-log plot:\n- For small depths ($h \\ll h^*$): $1 + h^*/h \\approx h^*/h$. The model approximates to $H \\approx H_0 \\sqrt{h^*/h} = (H_0 \\sqrt{h^*}) h^{-1/2}$. In this regime, $\\log(H) \\approx \\text{constant} - \\frac{1}{2}\\log(h)$, which is a straight line with a slope of $-1/2$.\n- For large depths ($h \\gg h^*$): $1 + h^*/h \\approx 1$. The model approximates to $H \\approx H_0$. In this regime, $\\log(H) \\approx \\log(H_0)$, which is a horizontal line with a slope of $0$.\n\nA log-log plot of data following the Nix-Gao model will therefore be a curve, transitioning from a slope of $-1/2$ at small $h$ to a slope of $0$ at large $h$. Attempting to fit a single straight line to a finite intermediate range of this curve will produce an \"apparent\" or \"spurious\" scaling exponent whose value depends entirely on the chosen data range and has no fundamental physical meaning in the context of the Nix-Gao model. Such a procedure is misleading because it incorrectly imposes a pure power-law interpretation onto a model that is not a pure power law. The presence of the additive constant_—_the bulk hardness $H_0$_—_is precisely what invalidates the use of a simple log-log plot for testing the model's full form.\n\nWith this rigorous analysis, we now evaluate the provided options.\n\nA. This option correctly states that the model includes an additive finite baseline ($H_0$), distinguishing it from a pure power law. It correctly identifies that a log-log plot can yield a spurious exponent over a limited range. It correctly states that plotting $H^2$ versus $1/h$ linearizes the model. It correctly identifies the physical meaning of the intercept ($H_0^2$) and the slope (related to $h^*$). It correctly concludes that the $H^2$ versus $1/h$ plot is preferable. This statement is entirely consistent with our derivation. **Correct**.\n\nB. This option makes several false claims. A log-log plot does not \"remove additive constants\"; this is its primary failure mode for models like Nix-Gao. It does not \"always provide the correct scaling exponent.\" It claims that the $H^2$ versus $1/h$ plot \"hides the bulk hardness\" and \"cannot be used to extract a characteristic length,\" both of which are the exact opposite of the truth. The intercept directly gives $H_0^2$ and the slope and intercept together yield $h^*$. **Incorrect**.\n\nC. This option claims that both plots are equivalent and linear. As derived, only the $H^2$ versus $1/h$ plot is linear for the Nix-Gao model. The log-log plot is a curve. The slopes and intercepts have different physical dimensions and are in no way identical. **Incorrect**.\n\nD. This option incorrectly suggests that a plot of $H$ versus $1/h$ should be linear. The Nix-Gao model, $H = H_0 \\sqrt{1 + h^*/h}$, shows a non-linear relationship between $H$ and $1/h$. It also incorrectly claims there is \"no physical justification\" for squaring $H$. The justification is fundamental, stemming directly from the Taylor hardening law, where stress (and hardness) squared is proportional to dislocation density, and dislocation densities are additive. **Incorrect**.\n\nConclusion: The most accurate and comprehensive explanation is provided by option A.

Thus, the intercept is:\n$$I_{\\mathrm{app}} = Y(x_{c}) - x_{c}S_{\\mathrm{app}}$$\nSubstituting the expressions for $Y(x_c)$, $x_c$, and $S_{\\mathrm{app}}$:\n$$I_{\\mathrm{app}} = H_{0}^{2}(1 + h^{*}/h_{c})[\\phi(h_{c})]^{2} - \\frac{1}{h_{c}} H_{0}^{2}[\\phi(h_{c})]^{2} \\left[ h^{*} - 2s_{c}(h_{c} + h^{*}) \\right]$$\nFactoring out the common term $H_{0}^{2}[\\phi(h_{c})]^{2}$:\n$$I_{\\mathrm{app}} = H_{0}^{2}[\\phi(h_{c})]^{2} \\left[ (1 + \\frac{h^{*}}{h_{c}}) - \\frac{1}{h_{c}}(h^{*} - 2s_{c}(h_{c} + h^{*})) \\right]$$\nSimplifying the expression in the brackets:\n$$ \\left[ 1 + \\frac{h^{*}}{h_{c}} - \\frac{h^{*}}{h_{c}} + \\frac{2s_{c}(h_{c} + h^{*})}{h_{c}} \\right] = 1 + 2s_{c}\\left(1 + \\frac{h^{*}}{h_{c}}\\right) $$\nSo, the apparent intercept is:\n$$I_{\\mathrm{app}} = H_{0}^{2}[\\phi(h_{c})]^{2} \\left[ 1 + 2s_{c}\\left(1 + \\frac{h^{*}}{h_{c}}\\right) \\right]$$\nThe apparent characteristic length is defined as $h^{*}_{\\mathrm{app}} \\equiv S_{\\mathrm{app}}/I_{\\mathrm{app}}$.\n$$h^{*}_{\\mathrm{app}} = \\frac{H_{0}^{2}[\\phi(h_{c})]^{2} [h^{*} - 2s_{c}(h_{c} + h^{*})]}{H_{0}^{2}[\\phi(h_{c})]^{2} [1 + 2s_{c}(1 + \\frac{h^{*}}{h_{c}})]} = \\frac{h^{*} - 2s_{c}(h_{c} + h^{*})}{1 + 2s_{c}(1 + \\frac{h^{*}}{h_{c}})}$$\nFinally, we compute the distortion ratio $r = h^{*}_{\\mathrm{app}}/h^{*}$:\n$$r = \\frac{1}{h^{*}} \\left( \\frac{h^{*} - 2s_{c}(h_{c} + h^{*})}{1 + 2s_{c}(1 + \\frac{h^{*}}{h_{c}})} \\right)$$\nTo simplify, we can divide the numerator by $h^{*}$:\n$$r = \\frac{1 - \\frac{2s_{c}(h_{c} + h^{*})}{h^{*}}}{1 + 2s_{c}(1 + \\frac{h^{*}}{h_{c}})} = \\frac{1 - 2s_{c}(\\frac{h_{c}}{h^{*}} + 1)}{1 + 2s_{c}(1 + \\frac{h^{*}}{h_{c}})}$$\nThis is the final simplified expression for the distortion ratio.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{1 - 2s_{c}\\left(1 + \\frac{h_{c}}{h^{*}}\\right)}{1 + 2s_{c}\\left(1 + \\frac{h^{*}}{h_{c}}\\right)}}$$", "id": "2774769"}]}
