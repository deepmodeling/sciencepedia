The cohesive law is linear, with traction $t$ proportional to the displacement jump $\\delta$ across the interface via $t = K_0 \\, \\delta$.

The problem is approached by analyzing the compliance contribution from the bulk material and the cohesive interface separately.\n\nFirst, we derive the compliance of the intact structure, denoted as $C_0$. This structure is a prismatic bar of length $H$, cross-sectional area $A$, and Young's modulus $E$, subjected to a uniaxial tensile force $P$.\nAccording to the principles of linear elasticity, the axial stress $\\sigma$ is uniform and given by:\n$$ \\sigma = \\frac{P}{A} $$\nThe axial strain $\\varepsilon$ is related to the stress by Hooke's law:\n$$ \\varepsilon = \\frac{\\sigma}{E} = \\frac{P}{AE} $$\nThe total elongation of the bar, $u_0$, is the integral of the strain over the length of the specimen:\n$$ u_0 = \\int_0^H \\varepsilon \\, dx = \\varepsilon H = \\frac{PH}{AE} $$\nThe compliance $C_0$ is defined as the ratio of total displacement to the applied force:\n$$ C_0 = \\frac{u_0}{P} = \\frac{H}{AE} $$\nThis is the compliance of the structure without any cohesive interface.\n\nNext, we consider the structure with the intact, linear elastic cohesive interface at its mid-plane. The total displacement $u$ under the load $P$ is now the sum of two contributions: the elastic deformation of the bulk material, $u_{bulk}$, and the displacement jump $\\delta$ across the cohesive interface.\n$$ u = u_{bulk} + \\delta $$\nThe bulk material still has a total length of $H$ and is subjected to the same uniform stress $\\sigma = \\frac{P}{A}$. Therefore, its elongation is the same as the intact structure's elongation:\n$$ u_{bulk} = u_0 = \\frac{PH}{AE} $$\nThe cohesive interface is subjected to a traction $t$ that is equal to the stress in the adjacent bulk material, so $t = \\sigma = \\frac{P}{A}$.

The system is stable if $\\frac{dP}{d\\Delta} \\ge 0$ and exhibits snap-back instability if $\\frac{dP}{d\\Delta} < 0$. The onset of softening occurs at $\\delta = \\delta_{0}$, where the traction reaches its maximum. The system's response at this point is critically dependent on the tangent stiffness of the cohesive law, $k_{cz} = \\frac{dT}{d\\delta}$.\n\nA simplified but effective model, as suggested by the problem's reference to series combination, treats the system as the elastic structure (with stiffness $K_{struct}$) in series with the cohesive zone (with stiffness $K_{cz}$). The stability of this combined system is dictated by the interplay between the positive structural stiffness and the potentially negative cohesive stiffness during softening. Instability occurs when the magnitude of the negative cohesive stiffness, $|k_{cz}|$, becomes sufficiently large relative to the structural stiffness. A sudden onset of a large negative cohesive stiffness is therefore conducive to immediate instability.\n\nLet us evaluate the cohesive tangent stiffness for both laws at the onset of softening, i.e., at $\\delta \\to \\delta_{0}^{+}$.\n\nFor the exponential law:\nWe first compute the derivative of $T^{(e)}(\\delta)$:\n$$\n\\frac{dT^{(e)}}{d\\delta} = \\frac{d}{d\\delta} \\left[ T_{\\max}^{(e)} \\left(\\frac{\\delta}{\\delta_{0}}\\right) \\exp\\left(1 - \\frac{\\delta}{\\delta_{0}}\\right) \\right] = \\frac{T_{\\max}^{(e)}}{\\delta_{0}} \\exp\\left(1 - \\frac{\\delta}{\\delta_{0}}\\right) \\left(1 - \\frac{\\delta}{\\delta_{0}}\\right)\n$$\nAt the peak, where $\\delta = \\delta_{0}$, the tangent stiffness is:\n$$\n\\left.\\frac{dT^{(e)}}{d\\delta}\\right|_{\\delta=\\delta_{0}} = \\frac{T_{\\max}^{(e)}}{\\delta_{0}} \\exp(0) (1 - 1) = 0\n$$\nThe exponential law has a smooth peak, meaning the softening process begins with a zero tangent stiffness. The negative stiffness develops gradually as $\\delta$ increases beyond $\\delta_{0}$.\n\nFor the bilinear law:\nIn the pre-peak regime ($0 \\le \\delta \\le \\delta_0$), the stiffness is constant and positive: $\\frac{dT^{(b)}}{d\\delta} = K = \\frac{T_{\\max}^{(b)}}{\\delta_{0}}$.\nIn the post-peak softening regime ($\\delta_{0} < \\delta \\le \\beta\\delta_{0}$), the traction is $T^{(b)}(\\delta) = T_{\\max}^{(b)}\\left[\\,1 - \\frac{\\delta-\\delta_{0}}{(\\beta-1)\\,\\delta_{0}}\\,\\right]$. The tangent stiffness is:\n$$\n\\frac{dT^{(b)}}{d\\delta} = T_{\\max}^{(b)} \\frac{d}{d\\delta}\\left[1 - \\frac{\\delta}{(\\beta-1)\\delta_0} + \\frac{\\delta_0}{(\\beta-1)\\delta_0}\\right] = -\\frac{T_{\\max}^{(b)}}{(\\beta-1)\\delta_{0}}\n$$\nAt the onset of softening, $\\delta \\to \\delta_{0}^{+}$, the tangent stiffness abruptly drops from the positive value $K$ to this constant negative value.\n$$\n\\left.\\frac{dT^{(b)}}{d\\delta}\\right|_{\\delta=\\delta_{0}^{+}} = -\\frac{T_{\\max}^{(b)}}{(\\beta-1)\\delta_{0}}\n$$\n\n**Comparison and Conclusion on Stability:**\nThe stability analysis hinges on comparing the cohesive tangent stiffness at the peak.\n- The **exponential law** exhibits a smooth transition into softening, with an initial post-peak tangent stiffness of zero. This means at the point of peak load, the system's overall stiffness does not immediately become negative. The response is initially stable.\n- The **bilinear law** exhibits a sharp, discontinuous change in stiffness at the peak. It jumps from a positive stiffness to a finite negative stiffness of magnitude $\\frac{T_{\\max}^{(b)}}{(\\beta-1)\\delta_{0}}$. A sufficiently compliant structure (represented by its load-line stiffness, derived from beam theory) may not be able to control this sudden onset of softening, leading to immediate snap-back.\n\nTherefore, the bilinear law is inherently more prone to immediate snap-back instability at the onset of softening. This tendency is a function of $\\beta$: as $\\beta \\to 1^{+}$, the magnitude of the negative stiffness $\\left|-\\frac{T_{\\max}^{(b)}}{(\\beta-1)\\delta_{0}}\\right| \\to \\infty$, making instability almost certain for any real structure. Conversely, a large $\\beta$ corresponds to more gradual softening and promotes stability. The exponential law, by virtue of its smooth peak, is always stable at the precise moment of peak traction.\n\n**Computation of the Ratio $R(\\beta)$**\n\nFinally, we compute the ratio $R(\\beta) = \\frac{T_{\\max}^{(e)}}{T_{\\max}^{(b)}}$ using the expressions derived in Part (a).\n$$\nR(\\beta) = \\frac{T_{\\max}^{(e)}}{T_{\\max}^{(b)}} = \\frac{\\left(\\dfrac{\\Gamma}{e \\delta_{0}}\\right)}{\\left(\\dfrac{2\\Gamma}{\\beta \\delta_{0}}\\right)}\n$$\n$$\nR(\\beta) = \\frac{\\Gamma}{e \\delta_{0}} \\cdot \\frac{\\beta \\delta_{0}}{2\\Gamma} = \\frac{\\beta}{2e}\n$$", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\frac{\\beta}{2e}}\n$$", "id": "2775843"}, {"introduction": "A fundamental challenge in the computational modeling of material failure is ensuring that the results are objective and independent of the chosen discretization, such as the finite element mesh.

The core of the problem lies in the determination of this localization width $w$.\n\nWe will now evaluate the five specified test cases.\n\nCase A and B investigate the local model, where the constitutive law contains no intrinsic length scale. In such models, when discretized using a Finite Element (FE) mesh, strain localization and damage will concentrate in the smallest possible volume, which is a single layer of elements.

To remedy the mesh dependence, an internal material length scale, $\\ell$, is introduced. This is characteristic of nonlocal or gradient-enhanced models. This length scale establishes a minimum physical width for the process zone, $w_{\\text{eff}}$. For the specified first-gradient or exponential nonlocal regularization, the effective width is estimated as $w_{\\text{eff}} \\approx 2\\ell$. However, the discrete nature of the FE model imposes a constraint that the localization band cannot be smaller than one element, so $w_{\\text{eff}} \\ge h$. Combining these, the effective localization width is taken as the maximum of the physical and numerical length scales:\n$$\nw_{\\text{eff}} = \\max(2\\ell, h)\n$$\nThe regularized dissipated energy, $G_{\\text{reg}}$, is then calculated as:\n$$\nG_{\\text{reg}}(N, \\ell) = W \\cdot w_{\\text{eff}} = W \\cdot \\max\\left(2\\ell, \\frac{H}{N}\\right)\n$$\n\nCase C: Regularized model, $N = 10$, $\\ell = 0.002$ m\nThe element size is $h = H/N = 0.01 \\, \\text{m} / 10 = 0.001 \\, \\text{m}$.\nThe intrinsic process zone width is $2\\ell = 2 \\times 0.002 \\, \\text{m} = 0.004 \\, \\text{m}$.\nThe effective width is $w_{\\text{eff}} = \\max(0.004 \\, \\text{m}, 0.001 \\, \\text{m}) = 0.004 \\, \\text{m}$.\nThe dissipated energy is:\n$$\nG_{\\text{reg}} = \\left(1 \\times 10^6 \\, \\frac{\\text{J}}{\\text{m}^3}\\right) \\times (0.004 \\, \\text{m}) = 4000 \\, \\frac{\\text{J}}{\\text{m}^2}\n$$\n\nCase D: Regularized model, $N = 100$, $\\ell = 0.002$ m\nThe element size is $h = H/N = 0.01 \\, \\text{m} / 100 = 0.0001 \\, \\text{m}$.\nThe intrinsic process zone width is $2\\ell = 2 \\times 0.002 \\, \\text{m} = 0.004 \\, \\text{m}$.\nThe effective width is $w_{\\text{eff}} = \\max(0.004 \\, \\text{m}, 0.0001 \\, \\text{m}) = 0.004 \\, \\text{m}$.\nThe dissipated energy is:\n$$\nG_{\\text{reg}} = \\left(1 \\times 10^6 \\, \\frac{\\text{J}}{\\text{m}^3}\\right) \\times (0.004 \\, \\text{m}) = 4000 \\, \\frac{\\text{J}}{\\text{m}^2}\n$$\nComparing Case C and D, we observe that once the mesh is sufficiently fine such that $h < 2\\ell$, the computed dissipated energy becomes independent of the mesh size and is instead governed by the material property $\\ell$. This demonstrates the desired mesh objectivity.\n\nCase E: Regularized model, $N = 100$, $\\ell = 0.00025$ m\nThe element size is $h = H/N = 0.01 \\, \\text{m} / 100 = 0.0001 \\, \\text{m}$.\nThe intrinsic process zone width is $2\\ell = 2 \\times 0.00025 \\, \\text{m} = 0.0005 \\, \\text{m}$.\nThe effective width is $w_{\\text{eff}} = \\max(0.0005 \\, \\text{m}, 0.0001 \\, \\text{m}) = 0.0005 \\, \\text{m}$.\nThe dissipated energy is:\n$$\nG_{\\text{reg}} = \\left(1 \\times 10^6 \\, \\frac{\\text{J}}{\\text{m}^3}\\right) \\times (0.0005 \\, \\text{m}) = 500 \\, \\frac{\\text{J}}{\\text{m}^2}\n$$\nThis case further confirms that the regularized fracture energy is directly controlled by the internal length $\\ell$, provided the mesh resolves this length scale ($h \\ll \\ell$).", "answer": "```python\n# The complete and runnable Python 3 code goes here.\n# Imports must adhere to the specified execution environment.\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Computes the dissipated energy for five test cases related to\n    interfacial fracture mechanics, demonstrating mesh dependence\n    in local models and its regularization via an internal length scale.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Given constants for all test cases\n    H = 0.01  # Thickness in meters\n    sigma_0 = 100e6  # Peak nominal stress in Pascals\n    eps_f = 0.02  # Failure strain (dimensionless)\n\n    # Test suite definition\n    # Each case is a dictionary specifying the model and its parameters\n    test_cases = [\n        {'case_id': 'A', 'model': 'local', 'N': 10, 'l': None},\n        {'case_id': 'B', 'model': 'local', 'N': 100, 'l': None},\n        {'case_id': 'C', 'model': 'regularized', 'N': 10, 'l': 0.002},\n        {'case_id': 'D', 'model': 'regularized', 'N': 100, 'l': 0.002},\n        {'case_id': 'E', 'model': 'regularized', 'N': 100, 'l': 0.00025},\n    ]\n\n    results = []\n\n    # Calculate the work per unit volume (energy density)\n    # This is constant for all cases.\n    # W = 0.5 * sigma_0 * eps_f\n    W = 0.5 * sigma_0 * eps_f  # Units: J/m^3\n\n    for case in test_cases:\n        N = case['N']\n        model_type = case['model']\n        \n        # Calculate the element size h\n        h = H / N\n        \n        dissipated_energy = 0.0\n\n        if model_type == 'local':\n            # In the local model, localization width w is the element size h.\n            # G_local = W * h\n            dissipated_energy = W * h\n        elif model_type == 'regularized':\n            l_internal = case['l']\n            # Effective width is the max of the physical scale (2*l) and numerical scale (h).\n            # w_eff = max(2 * l, h)\n            # G_reg = W * w_eff\n            w_eff = max(2 * l_internal, h)\n            dissipated_energy = W * w_eff\n            \n        # The problem asks for results as floating-point numbers rounded to three decimal places.\n        # Since all results are whole numbers, `round(x, 3)` will produce a float\n        # like 1000.0, which is then converted to a string.\n        rounded_result = round(dissipated_energy, 3)\n        results.append(rounded_result)\n\n    # Format the final output as a comma-separated list in square brackets.\n    # The map(str, ...) converts each float in the results list to its string representation.\n    # e.g., 1000.0 becomes \"1000.0\"\n    print(f\"[{','.join(map(str, results))}]\")\n\nsolve()\n```", "id": "2775826"}]}
