The condition is $\\dot{\\epsilon}\\, t_e \\ll 1$.

The condition `much less than` ($\\ll$) implies that the strain rate should be at least one, and preferably several, orders of magnitude smaller than $10^{12}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$.\n\n2.  **Continuum Stress Estimation**: The problem demands an estimate of the *Cauchy stress*, a continuum field quantity. The specified Irving-Kirkwood (IK) formalism bridges the atomistic and continuum scales by performing spatial and temporal averaging.\n    - **Spatial Averaging**: The stress must be computed over a volume large enough to contain a statistically significant number of atoms, yet small enough to resolve the stress gradient near the notch tip. The notch radius is $r_0=2\\,\\mathrm{nm}$ and the lattice parameter is $a_0 = 0.36\\,\\mathrm{nm}$. A suitable averaging length scale (e.g., kernel width $w$ or probe radius $r_s$) should be intermediate to these values, i.e., $a_0 < w, r_s < r_0$.

Applying a thermostat to a region where mechanical properties are being measured is generally incorrect as it can artificially alter dynamics and momentum transport. A preferred method is to thermostat regions far from the \"gauge section\" to act as a heat sink, while allowing the gauge section to evolve under microcanonical (NVE) dynamics.\n\nWith these criteria, each option is evaluated.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A.

Apply temporal averaging over a window $\\Delta t = 1.0\\,\\mathrm{ps}$ when extracting $\\sigma_{\\max}$ at a given applied strain.**\n\n- **Strain Rate**: $\\dot{\\epsilon} = 1\\times 10^8\\,\\mathrm{s^{-1}}$. The quasi-static check yields $\\dot{\\epsilon} \\, t_e = (1\\times 10^8\\,\\mathrm{s^{-1}}) \\times (1.03 \\times 10^{-12}\\,\\mathrm{s}) = 1.03 \\times 10^{-4}$. This value is much less than $1$, so the loading is correctly quasi-static.\n- **Thermostat**: The hybrid NVT/NVE scheme is the state-of-the-art method. Thermostatting only the far-field regions prevents artifacts in the gauge region containing the notch, whose dynamics are correctly integrated in the NVE ensemble. The Nosé–Hoover thermostat is a physically sound choice that generates a canonical ensemble.\n- **Stress Calculation**: It uses the IK estimator, as required. The spatial averaging scales $w = 0.5\\,\\mathrm{nm}$ and $r_s = 1.0\\,\\mathrm{nm}$ are appropriate: they are larger than the interatomic spacing ($a_0 = 0.36\\,\\mathrm{nm}$) and smaller than the geometric feature size ($r_0 = 2\\,\\mathrm{nm}$), enabling a spatially resolved yet statistically smooth stress field.\n- **Temporal Averaging**: The averaging window $\\Delta t = 1.0\\,\\mathrm{ps}$ is of the same order as $t_e$ and is approximately $5-10$ typical atomic vibration periods, which is sufficient to average out thermal noise. The strain accumulation during this window, $\\Delta\\epsilon = \\dot{\\epsilon} \\Delta t = 10^{-4}$, is negligible, so the averaging does not blur the stress evolution.\n- **Verdict**: **Correct**.

The quasi-static check gives $\\dot{\\epsilon} \\, t_e \\approx 1$. This violates the $\\ll 1$ condition, representing shock loading, not quasi-static deformation. The material response will be dominated by wave propagation and inertia, not elastic equilibrium.\n- **Thermostat**: Global velocity rescaling is a crude, non-physical thermostat that does not generate a correct statistical ensemble. Applying it to all atoms at every timestep severely perturbs the system's natural dynamics and invalidates the measurement of momentum flux.\n- **Stress Calculation**: This is fundamentally incorrect. The concept of a continuum Cauchy stress requires averaging over a volume. \"Per-atom stress\" is a mathematically ambiguous quantity, and using the value from a single atom without any spatial or temporal averaging will result in a measurement dominated by enormous thermal fluctuations, bearing no resemblance to the local continuum stress. This directly contradicts the IK formalism.\n- **Verdict**: **Incorrect**. This protocol is flawed in every aspect: the strain rate is too high, the thermostat is inappropriate, and the stress calculation method is physically meaningless.\n\n**C.

Compute local stress using an IK estimator but with a Gaussian kernel width $w = 0.05\\,\\mathrm{nm}$ and a spherical probe of radius $r_s = 0.1\\,\\mathrm{nm}$ at the notch root. Use temporal averaging over $\\Delta t = 0.01\\,\\mathrm{ps}$ to obtain $\\sigma_{\\max}$.**\n\n- **Strain Rate**: $\\dot{\\epsilon} = 1\\times 10^9\\,\\mathrm{s^{-1}}$. The quasi-static check gives $\\dot{\\epsilon} \\, t_e = (1\\times 10^9\\,\\mathrm{s^{-1}}) \\times (1.03 \\times 10^{-12}\\,\\mathrm{s}) = 1.03 \\times 10^{-3} \\ll 1$. This strain rate is acceptable.\n- **Thermostat**: A Langevin thermostat applied globally is problematic. It introduces stochastic and dissipative forces on all atoms, including those in the gauge region, which can dampen mechanical waves and alter the stress field. The chosen damping time, $\\tau_T = 0.01\\,\\mathrm{ps}$, is extremely short (less than typical vibrational periods), leading to an overdamped system where momentum transport is artificially suppressed. This is a poor choice for measuring mechanical response.\n- **Stress Calculation**: While the IK estimator is named, the choice of spatial averaging lengths, $w = 0.05\\,\\mathrm{nm}$ and $r_s = 0.1\\,\\mathrm{nm}$, is nonsensical. These lengths are significantly smaller than the lattice parameter ($a_0 = 0.36\\,\\mathrm{nm}$). An averaging volume this small cannot contain even a single atom on average, defeating the purpose of coarse-graining and failing to produce a meaningful continuum value.\n- **Temporal Averaging**: The window $\\Delta t = 0.01\\,\\mathrm{ps}$ is far too short to average out thermal noise, as it is shorter than the period of atomic vibrations.\n- **Verdict**: **Incorrect**. Despite an acceptable strain rate, the global, aggressive thermostatting and the unphysically small spatial and temporal averaging scales render this protocol invalid for estimating a continuum stress.\n\n**D. Conduct the simulation in a constant number, pressure, and temperature (NPT) ensemble with a Nosé–Hoover thermostat at $T = 300\\,\\mathrm{K}$ and a barostat that maintains zero average lateral pressure during uniaxial tension at strain rate $\\dot{\\epsilon} = 1\\times 10^8\\,\\mathrm{s^{-1}}$. Report $\\sigma_{\\max}$ as the maximum principal value of the global virial Cauchy stress tensor computed over the entire simulation box at each strain.**\n\n- **Strain Rate**: $\\dot{\\epsilon} = 1\\times 10^8\\,\\mathrm{s^{-1}}$ is appropriate, as established in the analysis of option A.\n- **Thermostat/Ensemble**: Using an NPT ensemble with a barostat is incorrect for this problem. A barostat controls the pressure by scaling the entire simulation box volume. For an inhomogeneous system with a strong stress gradient, like a body with a notch, applying a single pressure constraint to the whole volume is physically meaningless and will distort the stress field. The problem describes a semi-infinite body, which should have fixed boundaries, not a volume that globally contracts/expands to meet a pressure target.\n- **Stress Calculation**: This is the most severe flaw. The protocol reports the *global* virial stress, which is the average stress over the entire simulation domain. The objective is to measure the stress *concentration at the notch root*, a highly localized phenomenon. Reporting the global average stress completely ignores the stress concentration effect, which is the central point of the problem.\n- **Verdict**: **Incorrect**. The use of a barostat is inappropriate for this geometry, and reporting the global stress instead of the local stress at the notch root fundamentally fails to answer the question posed.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nProtocol A is the only one that correctly applies the principles of quasi-static loading, non-invasive thermostatting, and proper spatial-temporal averaging as required by the Irving-Kirkwood formalism to obtain a physically meaningful, local, continuum stress field at the notch root. All other options contain one or more fundamental errors that invalidate them for this task.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2788624"}]}
