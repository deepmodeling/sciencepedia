It is a straightforward and fundamental calculation in crystallography, testing the conversion of Miller indices for a direction into a physical vector magnitude. A solution will be provided.\n\nThe task is to determine the magnitude of the Shockley partial Burgers vector, which is given as $\\mathbf{b} = \\frac{a}{6}[1\\,1\\,-2]$.\n\nIn a cubic crystal system, the crystallographic directions $[100]$, $[010]$, and $[001]$ are mutually orthogonal.

It is based on established principles of dislocation theory within materials science, specifically the line-tension model and the Peach-Koehler force, which are standard concepts for analyzing dislocation behavior. All necessary parameters and conditions for a unique solution are provided. Therefore, the problem is valid, and a solution will be derived.\n\nThe derivation begins from first principles, considering the forces acting on a segment of a dislocation line. The problem considers a semicircular dislocation half-loop of radius $R$ nucleating from a free surface. Two primary forces act on each differential length element $d\\vec{l}$ of the dislocation line.\n\nFirst is the force due to the externally applied resolved shear stress, $\\tau$. This force is described by the Peach-Koehler equation. The force per unit length, $\\vec{f}_{PK}$, on a dislocation with Burgers vector $\\vec{b}$ and line sense vector $\\vec{\\xi}$ in a stress field $\\sigma$ is given by $\\vec{f}_{PK} = (\\sigma \\cdot \\vec{b}) \\times \\vec{\\xi}$. For a simple shear stress $\\tau$ acting on the slip plane, the glide component of this force, which drives the expansion of the loop, has a magnitude of $f_{PK} = \\tau b$. This force acts perpendicular to the dislocation line, within the slip plane, directed outwards to expand the loop. For a circular loop, this force is directed radially outward.\n\nSecond is the force arising from the line tension, $T$, of the dislocation. A dislocation line has an associated self-energy per unit length, which acts as a line tension. Any curvature in the line leads to a restoring force that tends to straighten the line, minimizing its length and thus its energy. This force, analogous to the pressure difference across a curved membrane due to surface tension, is directed towards the center of curvature. Its magnitude per unit length, $f_T$, is given by $f_T = T/R_{curv}$, where $R_{curv}$ is the local radius of curvature. For a circular arc of radius $R$, the radius of curvature is simply $R$, so the line tension force per unit length is $f_T = T/R$. This force is directed radially inward, opposing the expansion of the loop.\n\nThe problem specifies a simplified linear-elastic line tension model where $T$ is a constant given by the expression:\n$$T = \\alpha \\mu b^{2}$$\nHere, $\\mu$ is the shear modulus, $b$ is the magnitude of the Burgers vector, and $\\alpha$ is a dimensionless proportionality constant. Substituting this into the expression for the line tension force gives:\n$$f_T = \\frac{\\alpha \\mu b^{2}}{R}$$\n\nFor the dislocation half-loop to be in quasi-static equilibrium at a radius $R$, the outward-directed Peach-Koehler force must exactly balance the inward-directed line tension force.\n$$f_{PK} = f_T$$\nSubstituting the expressions for these forces yields the equilibrium condition:\n$$\\tau b = \\frac{\\alpha \\mu b^{2}}{R}$$\nWe are asked to find the critical resolved shear stress, $\\tau_c$, required to sustain a half-loop of critical radius $R_c$. This represents the maximum of the energy barrier to nucleation. At this critical point, the stress $\\tau$ is equal to $\\tau_c$ and the radius $R$ is equal to $R_c$. The equilibrium equation at the critical configuration is:\n$$\\tau_c b = \\frac{\\alpha \\mu b^{2}}{R_c}$$\nTo find the expression for $\\tau_c$, we solve this equation for $\\tau_c$ by dividing both sides by $b$ (as $b \\neq 0$):\n$$\\tau_c = \\frac{\\alpha \\mu b}{R_c}$$\nThis is the derived expression for the critical resolved shear stress required for dislocation nucleation from a surface, according to the specified model.\n\nThe next task is to evaluate this expression numerically using the provided values:\n- Dimensionless constant, $\\alpha = 0.5$\n- Shear modulus, $\\mu = 30\\,\\mathrm{GPa}$\n- Burgers vector magnitude, $b = 0.25\\,\\mathrm{nm}$\n- Critical radius, $R_c = 10\\,\\mathrm{nm}$\n\nSubstituting these values into the derived expression for $\\tau_c$:\n$$\\tau_c = \\frac{(0.5)(30\\,\\mathrm{GPa})(0.25\\,\\mathrm{nm})}{10\\,\\mathrm{nm}}$$\nThe units of length, nanometers ($\\mathrm{nm}$), in the numerator and denominator cancel out, leaving the result in gigapascals ($\\mathrm{GPa}$), as required.\n$$\\tau_c = (0.5) \\times (30) \\times \\frac{0.25}{10} \\,\\mathrm{GPa}$$\n$$\\tau_c = 15 \\times 0.025 \\,\\mathrm{GPa}$$\nPerforming the multiplication:\n$$15 \\times 0.025 = 15 \\times \\frac{25}{1000} = \\frac{375}{1000} = 0.375$$\nTherefore, the numerical value for the critical resolved shear stress is:\n$$\\tau_c = 0.375\\,\\mathrm{GPa}$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to three significant figures.

The analysis is based on the generalized planar fault energy ($\\gamma$-surface) framework for a face-centered cubic (FCC) crystal.\n\nFirst, we must establish the energy barriers for the two competing plasticity mechanisms: continued slip and deformation twinning.

The minimum energy path for this process involves surmounting the energy barrier associated with the unstable stacking fault. The energy density of this saddle-point configuration is $\\gamma_{us}$.

The minimum energy path for this process involves surmounting the energy barrier associated with the unstable twinning fault. The energy density of this saddle-point configuration is $\\gamma_{ut}$. The energy barrier, measured from the same ISF reference state, is the energy difference between the unstable twinning fault state and the intrinsic stacking fault state.\n    $$\n    \\Delta E_{\\text{twin}} = \\gamma_{ut} - \\gamma_{isf}\n    $$\n\n3.  **Derivation of the Twinning Propensity Parameter ($\\chi$)**:\n    The problem defines the dimensionless twinning propensity parameter, $\\chi$, as the ratio of the minimum energy barrier for twinning to the minimum energy barrier for continued slip.\n    $$\n    \\chi = \\frac{\\Delta E_{\\text{twin}}}{\\Delta E_{\\text{slip}}}\n    $$\n    Substituting the expressions for the energy barriers derived above, we obtain the expression for $\\chi$ in terms of the fundamental fault energies:\n    $$\n    \\chi = \\frac{\\gamma_{ut} - \\gamma_{isf}}{\\gamma_{us} - \\gamma_{isf}}\n    $$\n    This is the required expression.
