This first practice contrasts two fundamental strengthening mechanisms: grain boundary strengthening (the Hall-Petch effect) and dispersion strengthening (the Orowan mechanism). By analyzing the interaction of dislocations with different types of obstacles—planar grain boundaries versus discrete particles—you will derive and compare the distinct scaling laws that govern each process, sharpening your physical intuition for dislocation-based plasticity [@problem_id:2787006].", "problem": "A single crystal containing a uniform dispersion of impenetrable nanoparticles with mean planar obstacle spacing $\\lambda$ is compared to a polycrystal of the same alloy but without particles and with equiaxed grains of mean diameter $d$. Both samples are loaded in simple shear and deform by dislocation glide. Assume that nanoparticles in the dispersion are non-shearable by dislocations, while grain boundaries in the polycrystal are effective barriers to slip transfer. You are asked to differentiate the strengthening mechanisms that operate in these two cases by reasoning from the elastic line-tension picture of dislocations and from the concept of pile-ups against barriers.\n\nWhich option correctly states (i) how the increment in strength (shear or tensile, up to a material-dependent prefactor) scales with the characteristic obstacle spacing in each case, and (ii) the essential nature of the obstacles underlying that scaling?\n\nA. In the polycrystal, the strength increment scales as $\\Delta \\sigma \\propto d^{-1/2}$ because extended grain boundaries act as planar barriers that terminate dislocation pile-ups; in the dispersion-strengthened crystal, the strength increment scales as $\\Delta \\sigma \\propto \\lambda^{-1}$ because non-shearable particles pin dislocations that must bow out between pins.\n\nB.

It presents a standard, well-posed problem in materials science, grounded in the established principles of dislocation theory. It is free from scientific error, ambiguity, or contradiction. We may therefore proceed with the derivation of the solution.\n\nThe problem requires a comparison of two distinct strengthening mechanisms: strengthening by grain boundaries in a polycrystal and strengthening by a dispersion of impenetrable particles in a single crystal. We will analyze each case separately using the specified physical models.\n\nFirst, we consider the polycrystal with mean grain diameter $d$. The governing mechanism is the obstruction of dislocation motion by grain boundaries. In this model, known as the Hall-Petch effect, a dislocation source within a grain emits dislocations that glide on a slip plane until they are blocked by a grain boundary. Subsequent dislocations emitted from the same source pile up behind the leading one, creating a stress concentration at the head of the pile-up. Yielding of the material is associated with the propagation of slip into the adjacent grain, which occurs when this stress concentration reaches a critical value sufficient to activate a dislocation source in that neighboring grain.\n\nLet $\\tau_{\\text{applied}}$ be the applied shear stress. The stress at a distance $r$ from the tip of a pile-up of length $L$ is magnified. The pile-up length $L$ is on the order of the grain diameter $d$. The stress concentration at the head of the pile-up is proportional to the square root of the pile-up length. The stress required to push a dislocation through the lattice is the sum of the intrinsic friction stress, $\\tau_0$, and the additional stress required to overcome the grain boundary barrier, $\\Delta\\tau$. The stress acting on the grain boundary from the pile-up must overcome a critical stress $\\tau_c$ to initiate slip in the next grain. A simplified model from Eshelby, Frank, and Nabarro shows that this leads to a relationship where the additional stress, $\\Delta\\tau$, needed for yielding is inversely proportional to the square root of the grain size.\nThe total yield stress $\\sigma_y$ (or shear yield stress $\\tau_y$) is given by the Hall-Petch relation:\n$$ \\sigma_y = \\sigma_0 + k_y d^{-1/2} $$\nwhere $\\sigma_0$ is the friction stress for dislocation motion in a single crystal, and $k_y$ is the Hall-Petch coefficient, a material constant. The increment in strength is therefore $\\Delta \\sigma = k_y d^{-1/2}$.\nThus, for the polycrystal, the strength increment scales as $\\Delta \\sigma \\propto d^{-1/2}$. The physical basis is the dislocation pile-up against the effectively planar barrier of a grain boundary.\n\nSecond, we consider the single crystal containing a dispersion of impenetrable, non-shearable nanoparticles with a mean planar spacing of $\\lambda$. When a dislocation glides on its slip plane, it encounters these particles and cannot cut through them. Instead, the dislocation line must bow out between the particles. This mechanism is known as Orowan strengthening.\nThe force per unit length on a dislocation due to an applied shear stress $\\tau$ is $f = \\tau b$, where $b$ is the magnitude of the Burgers vector. For a dislocation segment of length $\\lambda$ pinned by two particles, the total forward force is $F_{\\text{applied}} = \\tau b \\lambda$. This force is balanced by the line tension, $T$, of the dislocation. The line tension creates a restoring force that opposes bowing.\nThe force balance equation is $F_{\\text{applied}} = 2T \\sin\\theta$, where $2\\theta$ is the angle between the two arms of the dislocation line segments at the pinning point. The radius of curvature of the bowed loop, $R$, is given by $R = \\lambda / (2\\sin\\theta)$. The condition for the dislocation to bypass the obstacle is that it must bow into a semicircular configuration, where the radius of curvature is minimal, $R_{\\text{min}} = \\lambda/2$. This represents the point of maximum resistance.\nThe stress required to achieve this critical curvature is the Orowan stress, $\\tau_{\\text{Or}}$. From the general force balance on a curved dislocation line, $\\tau b = T/R$, we can find the critical stress by substituting $R = R_{\\text{min}} = \\lambda/2$:\n$$ \\tau_{\\text{Or}} b = \\frac{T}{\\lambda/2} \\implies \\tau_{\\text{Or}} = \\frac{2T}{b\\lambda} $$\nThe line tension $T$ is approximately constant, often estimated as $T \\approx \\frac{1}{2}Gb^2$, where $G$ is the shear modulus. Therefore, the strength increment due to the particles, $\\Delta \\tau = \\tau_{\\text{Or}}$, scales as:\n$$ \\Delta \\tau \\propto \\frac{1}{\\lambda} $$\nThus, for the dispersion-strengthened crystal, the strength increment scales as $\\Delta \\sigma \\propto \\lambda^{-1}$. The physical basis is the bowing of dislocations between discrete, non-shearable pinning points.\n\nNow, we evaluate the given options.\n\nA. In the polycrystal, the strength increment scales as $\\Delta \\sigma \\propto d^{-1/2}$ because extended grain boundaries act as planar barriers that terminate dislocation pile-ups; in the dispersion-strengthened crystal, the strength increment scales as $\\Delta \\sigma \\propto \\lambda^{-1}$ because non-shearable particles pin dislocations that must bow out between pins.\nThis statement is entirely consistent with our derivations. The scaling for the polycrystal ($\\propto d^{-1/2}$) corresponds to the Hall-Petch effect, and the reason provided (pile-ups against planar barriers) is correct. The scaling for the dispersion-strengthened crystal ($\\propto \\lambda^{-1}$) corresponds to the Orowan mechanism, and the reason provided (bowing between non-shearable pins) is correct.\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\nB. In the polycrystal, the strength increment scales as $\\Delta \\sigma \\propto d^{-1}$; in the dispersion-strengthened crystal, the strength increment scales as $\\Delta \\sigma \\propto \\lambda^{1/2}$ because the particles are shearable coherent precipitates.\nThe scaling for the polycrystal is incorrect; it should be $d^{-1/2}$. The scaling for the dispersion-strengthened crystal is incorrect; it should be $\\lambda^{-1}$. Furthermore, the problem explicitly states the particles are \"impenetrable\" and \"non-shearable\", contradicting the reason given in this option.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\nC. In the polycrystal, the strength initially increases as $d$ decreases but eventually decreases at very small $d$ due to grain-boundary-mediated mechanisms; in the dispersion-strengthened crystal, the strength increment scales as $\\Delta \\sigma \\propto \\lambda^{-1}$, but only when the particles are shearable.\nThe description for the polycrystal refers to the inverse Hall-Petch effect, which occurs in the nanocrystalline regime (typically $d < 20 \\text{ nm}$) and is not the primary mechanism described by classical dislocation pile-up theory, which the problem invokes. More critically, the statement for the dispersion-strengthened crystal is fundamentally incorrect. The $\\lambda^{-1}$ scaling is the signature of *non-shearable* particles (Orowan bowing). Strengthening by shearable particles follows different, weaker scaling laws.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\nD. Both microstructures show the same scaling, $\\Delta \\sigma \\propto \\text{(obstacle spacing)}^{-1}$, because both mechanisms are governed by obstacle-controlled glide and the obstacles are effectively equivalent barriers at the dislocation scale.\nThis is incorrect. The scaling laws are different: $d^{-1/2}$ for grain boundaries and $\\lambda^{-1}$ for particles. The physical nature of the obstacles (planar boundaries versus discrete point-like obstacles) and the resulting dislocation interactions (pile-up versus bowing) are fundamentally different, leading to distinct mathematical dependencies.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\nE. In the polycrystal, the strength increment scales as $\\Delta \\sigma \\propto d^{1/2}$; in the dispersion-strengthened crystal, the increment scales as $\\Delta \\sigma \\propto \\ln \\lambda$.\nThe scaling for the polycrystal is incorrect. A $d^{1/2}$ dependence would imply strength *increases* with grain size, which contradicts all experimental evidence and theoretical models for this mechanism. The scaling for the dispersion-strengthened crystal is also incorrect. While the dislocation line tension has a logarithmic term in more refined models, the resulting stress for Orowan bowing scales as $\\lambda^{-1}$.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\nBased on the rigorous analysis of both strengthening mechanisms, only option A accurately describes the scaling laws and the underlying physics for both cases as stated in the problem.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2787006"}, {"introduction": "Physical laws like the Hall-Petch relation are often validated by fitting them to experimental data.

They exhibit a distinct parabolic (concave down) trend: they start negative, become positive for intermediate $x$, and become strongly negative again at the largest value of $x$. This systematic pattern indicates that the linear model is not a complete description of the data over the full range.\n\nThe most prominent feature is the large negative residual ($e_7 = -19.2 \\;\\mathrm{MPa}$) for the smallest grain size, $d_7 = 0.008 \\;\\mu\\mathrm{m} = 8 \\;\\mathrm{nm}$. This means the observed strength ($y_7 = 420.0 \\;\\mathrm{MPa}$) is significantly *weaker* than the strength predicted by the Hall-Petch linear extrapolation ($\\hat y_7 \\approx 439.2 \\;\\mathrm{MPa}$). This softening at very small, nanometer-scale grain sizes is the defining characteristic of the *inverse Hall-Petch effect*.\n\nFrom a nanomechanics perspective, the Hall-Petch relationship is based on dislocation pile-ups at grain boundaries. As grain size decreases, pile-ups become smaller, requiring higher stress to activate dislocation sources in adjacent grains. This mechanism leads to strengthening. However, in the nanocrystalline regime (typically for $d \\lesssim 10-20 \\;\\mathrm{nm}$), the material has an extremely high volume fraction of grain boundaries. Deformation mechanisms mediated by these boundaries, such as grain boundary sliding, grain rotation, and diffusional creep, can become energetically more favorable than dislocation-based plasticity. These alternative mechanisms are generally less resistant to plastic flow, leading to material softening. The negative deviation observed at $d = 8 \\;\\mathrm{nm}$ is therefore strong evidence for a transition in the dominant deformation mechanism from dislocation-controlled to grain-boundary-controlled plasticity.\n\nNow, we evaluate the options based on this complete analysis.\n\n**A. Perform OLS of $\\sigma_y$ on $x=d^{-1/2}$. One obtains approximately $b_1 \\approx 23.9\\;\\mathrm{MPa}\\cdot\\mu\\mathrm{m}^{1/2}$ and $b_0 \\approx 171.7\\;\\mathrm{MPa}$, with $95\\%$ confidence intervals $b_1 \\in [18.9,28.9]$ and $b_0 \\in [142,201]$. The residuals show a negative deviation at the largest $x$ (smallest $d$), together with a systematic trend across $x$, suggesting an emerging breakdown of linearity consistent with the onset of grain-boundary mediated plasticity (often termed an inverse Hall–Petch regime) below $\\sim 10\\;\\mathrm{nm}$.**\n- This option correctly reports the parameter estimates and confidence intervals calculated above. It correctly identifies the systematic trend in the residuals, the specific negative deviation at the smallest grain size, and provides the correct mechanistic interpretation in terms of the inverse Hall-Petch effect occurring at the given grain size of $8 \\;\\mathrm{nm}$.

The mathematical limit $d \\to 0$ corresponds to $d^{-1/2} \\to \\infty$, implying infinite strength in the Hall-Petch model, not zero. Neglecting residual variance in a CI calculation is statistically nonsensical. The curvature is systematic, not random scatter.\n- **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D.

Reporting estimates without measures of uncertainty (CIs) is also poor practice. The conclusion that linearity holds over the entire range is patently false, as it is achieved by ignoring the data point that demonstrates its failure.\n- **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**E. First fit the linear model $\\sigma_y$ versus $d^{-1/2}$ with OLS and report $t$-based $95\\%$ confidence intervals for $b_0$ and $b_1$. Then, to assess deviation from linearity, augment the model with a quadratic term in $x$ or perform a piecewise linear fit with a data-driven breakpoint, and test the additional parameter(s). A significant negative curvature or a break at small $d$ would support the interpretation that grain-boundary controlled mechanisms are reducing strength in the nanocrystalline limit.**\n- This option describes a scientifically and statistically rigorous approach for formally testing the hypothesis of non-linearity suggested by the residual analysis. Adding a quadratic term ($b_2 x^2$) and testing its significance is a standard method for detecting curvature. The interpretation—that a significant negative coefficient for the quadratic term would confirm the inverse Hall-Petch mechanism—is perfectly correct. This option presents a valid and sophisticated method of analysis and interpretation consistent with the data.\n- **Verdict: Correct.**\n\nBoth options A and E represent correct analysis and interpretation of the provided problem. Option A correctly performs the analysis exactly as requested by the prompt's enumerated tasks.

To eliminate electron-beam heating during in situ TEM microtensile tests, increase the beam current to reduce the exposure time; this control reduces softening artifacts at small $d$.", "solution": "The problem statement is a valid exercise in experimental nanomechanics. It describes a realistic research scenario concerning the measurement of strength in nanocrystalline materials, a topic where distinguishing intrinsic material behavior from experimental artifacts is of paramount importance. The observations, materials, and techniques are all standard in the field. The premises are scientifically grounded and the problem is well-posed, asking for an evaluation of plausible artifacts and their corresponding mitigation strategies. No invalidating flaws are present.\n\nThe analysis of each option proceeds as follows.\n\nA. **Residual porosity that increases as $d$ decreases (due to incomplete coalescence in electrodeposition) reduces the measured strength via a reduction of load-bearing area and pore-induced stress concentration, producing apparent softening at small $d$. Control: Quantify and match the relative density across all $d$ using helium pycnometry and Archimedes’ method to within $\\pm 0.5\\%$, reject batches with porosity fraction $f > 0.5\\%$, and confirm by X-ray microtomography; apply hot isostatic pressing to eliminate porosity without altering $d$.**\n\nThis statement correctly identifies a critical experimental artifact. Porosity is a common defect in materials produced by electrodeposition, particularly when optimizing for nanoscale grain structures. The presence of pores reduces the true load-bearing area $A_{\\text{true}}$ below the nominal area $A_{\\text{nom}}$, such that the measured stress $\\sigma_{\\text{meas}} = F/A_{\\text{nom}}$ is lower than the true stress $\\sigma_{\\text{true}} = F/A_{\\text{true}}$. If the porosity fraction $f_p$ increases as grain size $d$ decreases, this will create an apparent softening trend that could mimic or be mistaken for an inverse Hall-Petch effect. Pores also act as stress concentrators, which can initiate plastic flow or fracture prematurely, further reducing the measured strength.\n\nThe proposed controls are standard and appropriate for addressing this issue. Helium pycnometry and the Archimedes method are precise techniques for measuring bulk density and thus quantifying porosity. Setting a strict rejection criterion (e.g., $f_p > 0.5\\%$) is a necessary quality control step. Hot isostatic pressing (HIP) is a valid industrial and laboratory process for closing internal pores. However, the condition \"without altering $d$\" is challenging for nanocrystalline materials due to their high propensity for grain growth at the elevated temperatures used in HIP. Nonetheless, it represents the correct goal, achievable with careful optimization of HIP parameters (temperature, pressure, time). The overall statement is correct.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\nB. **Grain growth during testing (driven by capillarity and any testing-induced heating) causes $d$ at yield to exceed the pre-test $d$, so attributing a low $\\sigma_{\\mathrm{y}}$ to a small $d$ can be spurious. Control: Quantify $d$ immediately before and after testing by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), use active thermal management to keep $\\Delta T$ small, minimize hold times, and stabilize $d$ via Zener pinning with dilute solute additions that do not otherwise change the matrix strength.**\n\nThis statement accurately describes the artifact of microstructural instability. Nanocrystalline materials possess a large volume fraction of grain boundaries, creating a significant thermodynamic driving force for grain growth to reduce the total interfacial energy. This process is thermally activated and can be accelerated by any heating during the experiment, whether from the environment or from the deformation process itself. If the initial grain size $d_{\\text{initial}}$ coarsens to a larger size $d_{\\text{final}}$ during the test, the measured strength will correspond to $d_{\\text{final}}$. Associating this strength with $d_{\\text{initial}}$ leads to an erroneous data point that contributes to an apparent softening at small grain sizes.\n\nThe proposed controls are highly effective and represent best practices. Comparing pre- and post-mortem TEM images is the definitive method to check for grain growth. Minimizing thermal effects through active cooling and short test durations is crucial. The most robust method for preventing grain growth is thermodynamic stabilization, such as through Zener pinning, where solute atoms or fine precipitates segregate to grain boundaries and impede their motion. The qualifier that the solute additions should not significantly affect matrix strength is important for isolating the grain size effect. The statement is entirely correct.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\nC. **Intentional additions of oxygen and sulfur at approximately $100\\,\\mathrm{ppm}$ will eliminate inverse grain-size trends by strengthening grain boundaries; therefore, adding more impurities to smaller-$d$ samples is a valid control to normalize boundary strength across $d$.**\n\nThis statement is scientifically flawed. First, while grain boundary chemistry is known to influence strength, claiming that minor impurity additions will \"eliminate\" the inverse Hall-Petch effect is a strong overstatement. Such additions might shift the transition grain size but are unlikely to remove the mechanism change entirely. Second, and more critically, the proposed \"control\" is invalid. The goal of a controlled experiment is to isolate one variable (here, grain size $d$). Intentionally adding *more* impurities to samples with smaller $d$ introduces a second, confounding variable. The grain boundary area per unit volume scales as $\\sim 1/d$. Thus, even with a constant bulk impurity concentration, the segregation level at the boundaries will naturally vary with $d$. Artificially changing the bulk concentration with $d$ makes it impossible to deconvolve the effects of grain size from the effects of impurity content. This procedure does not \"normalize\" boundary strength; it confounds the measurement.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\nD. **In instrumented nanoindentation, the standard Oliver–Pharr contact-area model (derived under a sink-in assumption) underestimates the true contact area when pile-up occurs. If pile-up is more pronounced at larger $d$ but suppressed at smaller $d$ (due to a transition to grain-boundary-mediated flow), the computed hardness $H = P/A_{\\mathrm{c}}$ will be biased high for larger $d$ and closer to true for smaller $d$, creating an apparent decrease of $H$ with decreasing $d$. Control: Directly image residual indents by atomic force microscopy (AFM) or confocal microscopy to obtain $A_{\\mathrm{c}}$, apply pile-up corrections or a calibrated area function, and use spherical tips and depths where the contact-area model is validated.**\n\nThis statement describes a well-known and subtle artifact in nanoindentation. The Oliver-Pharr method for calculating hardness $H$ relies on an estimate of the projected contact area $A_c$ derived from the unloading curve. This method assumes the material deforms in a way that leads to \"sink-in\" around the indenter. In materials that do not work-harden significantly, material \"piles up\" around the indenter, leading to a true contact area that is larger than the Oliver-Pharr estimate. This underestimates $A_c$ and thus artificially inflates the calculated hardness $H = P/A_{\\mathrm{c}}$. The premise that pile-up behavior changes with grain size is plausible; for example, if the strain-rate sensitivity $m$ increases significantly at very small $d$, this could suppress pile-up. If pile-up is more severe in the larger grain size regime ($d > 15\\,\\mathrm{nm}$), the hardness for those samples would be systematically overestimated, creating an apparent drop in hardness as $d$ decreases that mimics an inverse Hall-Petch effect.\n\nThe proposed controls are the correct and standard procedures to address this artifact. Direct imaging of the residual indent with a high-resolution technique like AFM is the most reliable way to measure the true contact area, including pile-up. Applying existing pile-up correction models or using a directly calibrated tip area function are also valid approaches. The statement correctly identifies both a plausible artifact and the state-of-the-art methods to control for it.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\nE. **Focused ion beam (FIB) milling of micropillars introduces a damaged shell of thickness $t \\sim 20\\,\\mathrm{nm}$ from gallium implantation and amorphization that is potentially weakening grain boundaries near the surface and reducing the measured flow stress. Control: Use a low-kilovolt ($\\leq 5\\,\\mathrm{kV}$) final clean, cryogenic FIB, or xenon plasma FIB followed by low-energy broad ion milling to remove the damaged layer; alternatively, use non-FIB shaping.**\n\nThis statement correctly identifies a major artifact in small-scale mechanical testing. Standard FIB milling using a $30\\,\\mathrm{kV}$ Gallium ($Ga^+$) beam creates a surface layer damaged by ion implantation and sputtering. This damage, often an amorphous shell of thickness $t \\approx 20-30\\,\\mathrm{nm}$, can significantly alter the mechanical response. For micropillars, this damaged shell constitutes a non-negligible fraction of the sample volume, and its influence grows as the pillar diameter shrinks. This is particularly problematic for nanocrystalline materials where the damage depth $t$ can be comparable to or even larger than the grain size $d$. A weakened surface layer can promote premature plastic flow, leading to an artificially low measurement of yield stress $\\sigma_{\\mathrm{y}}$.\n\nThe proposed controls are modern, effective, and widely accepted solutions. A final polishing step with a low-energy Ga-FIB beam (e.g., $2-5\\,\\mathrm{kV}$) significantly reduces the damage depth. Alternative ion sources, like Xenon Plasma FIB, can offer advantages. Post-FIB processing with low-energy broad-beam ion milling is an excellent technique for removing the damaged layer entirely. Avoiding FIB altogether through methods like lithography and etching is an ideal but often more complex alternative. The statement is entirely correct.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\nF. **If smaller-$d$ samples are tested at a lower strain rate $\\dot{\\varepsilon} = 10^{-5}\\,\\mathrm{s^{-1}}$ while larger-$d$ samples are tested at $\\dot{\\varepsilon} = 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{s^{-1}}$, then positive strain-rate sensitivity ($m = \\partial \\ln \\sigma / \\partial \\ln \\dot{\\varepsilon} > 0$) produces lower measured strengths for smaller $d$, mimicking inverse grain-size softening. Control: Match $\\dot{\\varepsilon}$ across all $d$ and report the measured $m$ at constant temperature.**\n\nThis statement describes a fundamental error in experimental design. The flow stress $\\sigma$ of most metallic materials is dependent on the strain rate $\\dot{\\varepsilon}$, a relationship quantified by the strain-rate sensitivity exponent $m$. For materials with $m>0$, strength increases with strain rate. Nanocrystalline materials, particularly in the inverse Hall-Petch regime, often exhibit a significantly higher $m$ than their coarse-grained counterparts. Systematically testing samples with smaller $d$ at a lower $\\dot{\\varepsilon}$ than samples with larger $d$ will inherently produce lower strength values for the smaller-$d$ samples, due entirely to the testing conditions. This mimics an inverse grain-size dependence and invalidates any conclusions about the intrinsic effect of $d$.\n\nThe proposed control is the most basic and essential requirement for a valid comparison. To isolate the effect of grain size, all other test parameters, including strain rate $\\dot{\\varepsilon}$ and temperature $T$, must be held constant across all samples. Measuring and reporting $m$ is good scientific practice that further characterizes the material's behavior but the primary control is to maintain a constant $\\dot{\\varepsilon}$. The statement is correct.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\nG. **To eliminate electron-beam heating during in situ TEM microtensile tests, increase the beam current to reduce the exposure time; this control reduces softening artifacts at small $d$.**\n\nThis statement contains incorrect physical reasoning. In-situ TEM experiments involve continuous illumination of the sample by the electron beam. The energy deposited into the sample, which causes heating, is directly proportional to the beam current. Therefore, *increasing* the beam current will *increase* the sample temperature, not decrease it. The idea of reducing exposure time is nonsensical in the context of an in-situ test that records a process over time. A higher temperature would promote thermally activated softening mechanisms and/or grain growth, thereby *worsening* any softening artifact, not reducing it. The proper control to minimize beam heating is to *decrease* the beam current to the minimum level necessary for imaging, use a condenser aperture to limit the illuminated area, and ensure good thermal contact with the sample holder. The proposed control is the exact opposite of the correct procedure.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{ABDEF}$$", "id": "2787025"}]}
