The given numerical values are physically realistic. The derivation of the Stoney equation from first principles is a standard, non-trivial problem in the mechanics of materials.\n\nThe objective is to derive the relationship between the in-plane film stress $\\sigma_f$ and the induced substrate curvature $\\kappa$, and then to compute the numerical value of the stress.\n\nThe derivation proceeds from the principles of mechanical equilibrium and linear elastic plate theory. Consider a coordinate system where the substrate mid-plane lies in the $x$-$y$ plane, so the substrate occupies the domain $-t_s/2 \\le z \\le t_s/2$. The thin film of thickness $t_f$ is deposited on the top surface, occupying the domain $t_s/2  z \\le t_s/2+t_f$.\n\nThe uniform equi-biaxial stress $\\sigma_f$ within the film gives rise to an in-plane force per unit width, $F_f$, acting along the film's cross-section. This force is given by:\n$$ F_f = \\sigma_f t_f $$\nDue to the assumption $t_f \\ll t_s$, the neutral axis of the composite structure remains essentially at the mid-plane of the substrate ($z=0$). The force $F_f$ in the film acts at an effective distance from this neutral axis. The moment arm is the distance from the neutral axis to the mid-plane of the film, which is $z = t_s/2 + t_f/2$. Given $t_f \\ll t_s$, this lever arm is approximated as $t_s/2$.\n\nThis force creates a bending moment per unit width, $M$, that acts on the substrate. This moment is the product of the force per unit width and the lever arm:\n$$ M = F_f \\cdot \\left(\\frac{t_s}{2}\\right) = (\\sigma_f t_f) \\frac{t_s}{2} $$\nThis moment, applied by the film, causes the substrate to bend. The substrate, being an elastic plate, develops an internal resisting moment. According to the linear theory of isotropic plates, the relationship between the principal bending moments per unit width ($M_x$, $M_y$) and the principal curvatures ($\\kappa_x$, $\\kappa_y$) is:\n$$ M_x = D (\\kappa_x + \\nu_s \\kappa_y) $$\n$$ M_y = D (\\kappa_y + \\nu_s \\kappa_x) $$\nHere, $D$ is the flexural rigidity of the substrate plate, defined as:\n$$ D = \\frac{E_s t_s^3}{12(1-\\nu_s^2)} $$\nwhere $E_s$ is the Young's modulus and $\\nu_s$ is the Poisson's ratio of the substrate.\n\nThe problem states that the bending is equi-biaxial, meaning the curvature is the same in all in-plane directions. Thus, $\\kappa_x = \\kappa_y = \\kappa = 1/R$. The internal moments are also equi-biaxial, $M_x = M_y = M_s$. Substituting the equi-biaxial curvature into the moment-curvature relation gives:\n$$ M_s = D (\\kappa + \\nu_s \\kappa) = D(1+\\nu_s)\\kappa $$\nSubstituting the expression for $D$:\n$$ M_s = \\frac{E_s t_s^3}{12(1-\\nu_s^2)}(1+\\nu_s)\\kappa = \\frac{E_s t_s^3 (1+\\nu_s)}{12(1-\\nu_s)(1+\\nu_s)}\\kappa $$\n$$ M_s = \\frac{E_s t_s^3}{12(1-\\nu_s)}\\kappa $$\nThis internal resisting moment $M_s$ must balance the external moment $M$ applied by the film for the system to be in static equilibrium.

It is self-contained, scientifically grounded, and well-posed. We shall proceed with a rigorous derivation from first principles.\n\nFirst, we establish a coordinate system where the substrate lies in the $x$-$y$ plane, and the $z$-axis is normal to the surface. The origin, $z=0$, is placed at the geometric mid-plane of the substrate. Per the problem's simplifying assumptions, this is also the neutral plane of bending. The substrate thus occupies the domain $-t_s/2 \\le z \\le t_s/2$. The thin films are deposited on the top surface, from $z=t_s/2$ upwards.\n\nThe composite structure of films and substrate is a closed system with no external forces or moments applied. Therefore, at equilibrium, the total moment of all internal stresses, integrated over the entire cross-section, must be zero. We can express this condition as:\n$$ M_{total} = M_{substrate} + M_{films} = 0 $$\nwhere $M_{substrate}$ and $M_{films}$ are the moments per unit width generated by the stresses within the substrate and films, respectively, referenced to the neutral plane ($z=0$).\n\nThe moment in the substrate, $M_{substrate}$, arises from the bending-induced stresses. For an isotropic plate under equi-biaxial curvature $\\kappa$, the bending strain at a distance $z$ from the neutral plane is $\\epsilon_{bend}(z) = -\\kappa z$. The corresponding stress under plane-stress conditions is given by:\n$$ \\sigma_{s,bend}(z) = \\frac{E_s}{1-\\nu_s} \\epsilon_{bend}(z) = -\\frac{E_s \\kappa z}{1-\\nu_s} $$\nThe total stress in the substrate also includes a uniform component to maintain force equilibrium, but this component does not contribute to the moment integral about the mid-plane. The substrate's internal moment is then:\n$$ M_{substrate} = \\int_{-t_s/2}^{t_s/2} \\sigma_{s,bend}(z) z \\, dz = \\int_{-t_s/2}^{t_s/2} \\left(-\\frac{E_s \\kappa z}{1-\\nu_s}\\right) z \\, dz $$\n$$ M_{substrate} = -\\frac{E_s \\kappa}{1-\\nu_s} \\int_{-t_s/2}^{t_s/2} z^2 \\, dz $$\nThe integral is the second moment of area per unit width of the substrate's rectangular cross-section, which evaluates to $t_s^3/12$.\n$$ M_{substrate} = -\\frac{E_s \\kappa}{1-\\nu_s} \\frac{t_s^3}{12} $$\n\nThe moment from the films, $M_{films}$, is generated by the residual stresses $\\sigma_{f1}$ and $\\sigma_{f2}$. The total stress in the films after bending is the sum of the initial residual stress and the bending-induced stress. However, the problem states that the film bending stiffness is negligible. This is a key assumption which implies that the stress contribution from the film bending itself is ignored. Thus, we consider only the residual stresses, $\\sigma_{f1}$ and $\\sigma_{f2}$, which are uniform within their respective layers. The moment from the films is the integral of these stresses multiplied by their distance from the neutral plane:\n$$ M_{films} = \\int_{film \\, 1} \\sigma_{f1} z \\, dz + \\int_{film \\, 2} \\sigma_{f2} z \\, dz $$\nSince the films are thin, we can approximate this integral by taking the stress-thickness product and multiplying by the distance to the midpoint of each film.\nThe midpoint of film $1$ is at $z_1 = t_s/2 + t_{f1}/2$.\nThe midpoint of film $2$ is at $z_2 = t_s/2 + t_{f1} + t_{f2}/2$.\nGiven the assumption $t_{f1}, t_{f2} \\ll t_s$, we can simplify these positions to $z_1 \\approx z_2 \\approx t_s/2$.\n$$ M_{films} \\approx (\\sigma_{f1} t_{f1}) \\frac{t_s}{2} + (\\sigma_{f2} t_{f2}) \\frac{t_s}{2} = (\\sigma_{f1} t_{f1} + \\sigma_{f2} t_{f2}) \\frac{t_s}{2} $$\n\nNow, we apply the equilibrium condition $M_{substrate} + M_{films} = 0$:\n$$ -\\frac{E_s \\kappa t_s^3}{12(1-\\nu_s)} + (\\sigma_{f1} t_{f1} + \\sigma_{f2} t_{f2}) \\frac{t_s}{2} = 0 $$\nRearranging to solve for the curvature $\\kappa$ yields the desired expression:\n$$ \\frac{E_s \\kappa t_s^3}{12(1-\\nu_s)} = (\\sigma_{f1} t_{f1} + \\sigma_{f2} t_{f2}) \\frac{t_s}{2} $$\n$$ \\kappa = \\frac{12(1-\\nu_s)}{E_s t_s^3} (\\sigma_{f1} t_{f1} + \\sigma_{f2} t_{f2}) \\frac{t_s}{2} $$\n$$ \\kappa = \\frac{6(1-\\nu_s)}{E_s t_s^2} (\\sigma_{f1} t_{f1} + \\sigma_{f2} t_{f2}) $$\nThis is the generalized form of the Stoney equation for a bilayer film stack, derived from first principles as required.

This implies that the stress components normal to the wafer surface are zero. With the wafer surface being the $(001)$ plane, this means $\\sigma_3 = \\sigma_{33} = 0$. The other out-of-plane stress components are also zero: $\\sigma_{13} = \\sigma_{23} = 0$.\n2.  **Equi-biaxial In-plane Stress**: The residual stress in the film is uniform and equi-biaxial, imposing a stress state on the substrate where $\\sigma_1 = \\sigma_{11} = \\sigma_2 = \\sigma_{22} = \\sigma_f$. Due to the symmetry of this stress state on the $(001)$ plane, the in-plane shear stress is zero, $\\sigma_{12} = 0$.\n\nSubstituting these stress conditions into the constitutive equations yields the in-plane strain components:\n$$\n\\epsilon_{11} = s_{11} \\sigma_f + s_{12} \\sigma_f + s_{12} (0) = (s_{11} + s_{12}) \\sigma_f\n$$\n$$\n\\epsilon_{22} = s_{12} \\sigma_f + s_{11} \\sigma_f + s_{12} (0) = (s_{11} + s_{12}) \\sigma_f\n$$\nWe observe that the in-plane strains are also equal, $\\epsilon_{11} = \\epsilon_{22}$. Let us denote this common in-plane strain as $\\epsilon_f$.

The physical condition under which treating the $(001)$ silicon substrate as elastically isotropic is justified is precisely the one given in the problem statement: the application of a uniform, equi-biaxial in-plane stress. A cubic crystal's $(001)$ plane exhibits four-fold rotational symmetry. When subjected to a stress state that is invariant under arbitrary in-plane rotation (i.e., equi-biaxial), the strain response is also independent of in-plane direction. The derived modulus $M_{(001)} = 1/(s_{11} + s_{12})$ is a single scalar value, independent of in-plane direction, which reflects this effective \"in-plane isotropy\" under this specific loading condition.
