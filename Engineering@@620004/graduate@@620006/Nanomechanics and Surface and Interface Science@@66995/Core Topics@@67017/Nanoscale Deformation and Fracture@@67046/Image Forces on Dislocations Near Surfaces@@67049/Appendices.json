A straight Volterra screw dislocation of Burgers vector magnitude $b$ is parallel to the $x_{1}$-axis, with both its line direction and its Burgers vector along $\\hat{\\boldsymbol{e}}_{1}$. The dislocation line passes through the point $(x_{2}, x_{3}) = (h, 0)$, with $h>0$, and extends along $x_{1}$ (so the cross-section of interest is the $(x_{2}, x_{3})$-plane). The shear modulus is $\\mu$, and the medium is otherwise homogeneous and infinite in the $x_{1}$-direction. Using only the fundamentals of isotropic linear elasticity and the method of images required by the traction-free boundary condition at $x_{2} = 0$, determine the shear stress component $\\sigma_{13}$ at the location of the real dislocation that is induced by the image configuration necessary to satisfy the boundary condition. Then, using the Peach–Koehler (PK) force expression, deduce from first principles the scaling of the force per unit length acting on the real dislocation due to the free surface, and show that its magnitude scales as $1/h$.\n\nAssumptions: \n- Treat the dislocation as a Volterra line defect with a negligibly small core, and neglect any non-linear core effects. \n- The only boundary is the traction-free plane at $x_{2}=0$, with traction $t_{i} = \\sigma_{ij} n_{j}$ and outward unit normal $n_{j} = \\delta_{j2}$, so $t_{i} = \\sigma_{i2} = 0$ on $x_{2}=0$. \n- You may take as known the form of the stress field of a single screw dislocation in an infinite isotropic medium.\n\nProvide your final result for the image-induced $\\sigma_{13}$ at the dislocation location as a closed-form symbolic expression in terms of $\\mu$, $b$, and $h$.

All necessary data and conditions for a unique solution are provided. The minor ambiguity concerning the direction of the outward normal vector is resolved by the explicit statement of the correct physical boundary condition, $\\sigma_{i2} = 0$ on the plane $x_{2}=0$. The problem is therefore deemed valid and a solution will be constructed.\n\nThe problem concerns a straight screw dislocation parallel to the $x_{1}$-axis, located at a distance $h$ from a traction-free surface at $x_{2}=0$ in a linear elastic isotropic half-space defined by $x_{2} \\ge 0$. The dislocation line passes through the point $(x_{2}, x_{3}) = (h, 0)$, and its Burgers vector is $\\boldsymbol{b} = b \\hat{\\boldsymbol{e}}_{1}$. The material has a shear modulus $\\mu$.\n\nThe stress field of a straight screw dislocation with Burgers vector $b''$ along the $x_{1}$-axis and passing through the point $(x_{2}', x_{3}')$ in an infinite isotropic medium is known. The only non-zero stress components are $\\sigma_{12}$ and $\\sigma_{13}$, given by:\n$$ \\sigma_{12}(x_2, x_3) = -\\frac{\\mu b''}{2\\pi} \\frac{x_3 - x_3'}{(x_2-x_2')^2+(x_3-x_3')^2} $$\n$$ \\sigma_{13}(x_2, x_3) = \\frac{\\mu b''}{2\\pi} \\frac{x_2 - x_2'}{(x_2-x_2')^2+(x_3-x_3')^2} $$\nIn this problem, the real dislocation (denoted by superscript $R$) is at $(x_{2}', x_{3}') = (h, 0)$ and has a Burgers vector $b'' = b$. Its stress field is therefore:\n$$ \\sigma_{12}^{(R)}(x_2, x_3) = -\\frac{\\mu b}{2\\pi} \\frac{x_3}{(x_2-h)^2+x_3^2} $$\n$$ \\sigma_{13}^{(R)}(x_2, x_3) = \\frac{\\mu b}{2\\pi} \\frac{x_2-h}{(x_2-h)^2+x_3^2} $$\nThe total stress field in the half-space is the superposition of the real dislocation's field and an image field, $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma} = \\boldsymbol{\\sigma}^{(R)} + \\boldsymbol{\\sigma}^{(I)}$. The image field must be chosen such that the traction-free boundary condition at $x_2=0$ is satisfied. For a screw dislocation, the stress components $\\sigma_{22}$ and $\\sigma_{32}$ are identically zero. The boundary condition $t_{i} = \\sigma_{i2} = 0$ at $x_{2}=0$ reduces to requiring only $\\sigma_{12}(x_2=0, x_3) = 0$.\nThus, we must have $\\sigma_{12}^{(R)}(0, x_3) + \\sigma_{12}^{(I)}(0, x_3) = 0$ for all values of $x_{3}$.\n\nAt the boundary $x_{2}=0$, the stress from the real dislocation is:\n$$ \\sigma_{12}^{(R)}(0, x_3) = -\\frac{\\mu b}{2\\pi} \\frac{x_3}{(0-h)^2+x_3^2} = -\\frac{\\mu b}{2\\pi} \\frac{x_3}{h^2+x_3^2} $$\nTo cancel this stress, we introduce an image screw dislocation (superscript $I$) with Burgers vector $b'$ at a location $(x_{2}'', x_{3}'')$. To maintain the symmetry of the stress expression with respect to $x_3$, the image dislocation must be located at $x_{3}''=0$. We place it at $(-h, 0)$, symmetrically with respect to the boundary. The stress field of this image dislocation is:\n$$ \\sigma_{12}^{(I)}(x_2, x_3) = -\\frac{\\mu b'}{2\\pi} \\frac{x_3}{(x_2 - (-h))^2 + x_3^2} = -\\frac{\\mu b'}{2\\pi} \\frac{x_3}{(x_2+h)^2+x_3^2} $$\nAt the boundary $x_{2}=0$, this gives:\n$$ \\sigma_{12}^{(I)}(0, x_3) = -\\frac{\\mu b'}{2\\pi} \\frac{x_3}{h^2+x_3^2} $$\nThe boundary condition $\\sigma_{12}^{(R)}(0, x_3) + \\sigma_{12}^{(I)}(0, x_3) = 0$ yields:\n$$ -\\frac{\\mu b}{2\\pi} \\frac{x_3}{h^2+x_3^2} - \\frac{\\mu b'}{2\\pi} \\frac{x_3}{h^2+x_3^2} = 0 $$\nThis equation must hold for all $x_{3}$, which requires that $-(\\mu b + \\mu b') = 0$, leading to $b' = -b$. The image dislocation is an anti-dislocation, with Burgers vector opposite to the real one, located at $(x_{2}, x_{3}) = (-h, 0)$.\n\nThe problem requests the shear stress component $\\sigma_{13}$ at the location of the real dislocation, $(h, 0)$, that is induced by the image configuration. This is the stress component $\\sigma_{13}^{(I)}$ evaluated at $(h, 0)$. The stress field $\\sigma_{13}^{(I)}$ from the image dislocation is:\n$$ \\sigma_{13}^{(I)}(x_2, x_3) = \\frac{\\mu b'}{2\\pi} \\frac{x_2 - (-h)}{(x_2+h)^2+x_3^2} = \\frac{\\mu (-b)}{2\\pi} \\frac{x_2+h}{(x_2+h)^2+x_3^2} = -\\frac{\\mu b}{2\\pi} \\frac{x_2+h}{(x_2+h)^2+x_3^2} $$\nEvaluating this expression at the location of the real dislocation, $(x_{2}, x_{3}) = (h, 0)$:\n$$ \\sigma_{13}^{(I)}(h, 0) = -\\frac{\\mu b}{2\\pi} \\frac{h+h}{(h+h)^2+0^2} = -\\frac{\\mu b}{2\\pi} \\frac{2h}{(2h)^2} = -\\frac{\\mu b}{2\\pi} \\frac{2h}{4h^2} = -\\frac{\\mu b}{4\\pi h} $$\nThis is the first part of the required result.\n\nNext, we deduce the force per unit length on the dislocation. The Peach-Koehler force per unit length $\\boldsymbol{F}$ on a dislocation with line direction $\\boldsymbol{\\xi}$ and Burgers vector $\\boldsymbol{b}$ is given by $\\boldsymbol{F} = (\\boldsymbol{\\sigma} \\cdot \\boldsymbol{b}) \\times \\boldsymbol{\\xi}$, where $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}$ is the stress tensor from all external sources evaluated at the dislocation line. In this case, the \"external\" stress is the stress from the image dislocation, $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}^{(I)}$.\nIn component form, $F_i = \\epsilon_{ijk} \\sigma_{jp} b_p \\xi_k$. Here, $\\boldsymbol{\\xi} = (1, 0, 0)$ and $\\boldsymbol{b} = (b, 0, 0)$.\nThe force components in the $(x_2, x_3)$-plane are:\n$$ F_2 = \\epsilon_{2jk} \\sigma_{jp}^{(I)} b_p \\xi_k = \\epsilon_{231} \\sigma_{3p}^{(I)} b_p \\xi_1 = \\sigma_{31}^{(I)} b_1 = \\sigma_{13}^{(I)} b $$\n$$ F_3 = \\epsilon_{3jk} \\sigma_{jp}^{(I)} b_p \\xi_k = \\epsilon_{312} \\sigma_{1p}^{(I)} b_p \\xi_2 + \\epsilon_{321} \\sigma_{2p}^{(I)} b_p \\xi_1 = -\\sigma_{21}^{(I)} b_1 = -\\sigma_{12}^{(I)} b $$\nWe evaluate the required stress components from the image dislocation at the position of the real dislocation, $(h, 0)$. We have already found $\\sigma_{13}^{(I)}(h, 0) = -\\frac{\\mu b}{4\\pi h}$.\nNow we compute $\\sigma_{12}^{(I)}(h, 0)$:\n$$ \\sigma_{12}^{(I)}(x_2, x_3) = -\\frac{\\mu b'}{2\\pi} \\frac{x_3}{(x_2+h)^2+x_3^2} = \\frac{\\mu b}{2\\pi} \\frac{x_3}{(x_2+h)^2+x_3^2} $$\n$$ \\sigma_{12}^{(I)}(h, 0) = \\frac{\\mu b}{2\\pi} \\frac{0}{(h+h)^2+0^2} = 0 $$\nSubstituting these values into the force component expressions:\n$$ F_2 = \\left(-\\frac{\\mu b}{4\\pi h}\\right) b = -\\frac{\\mu b^2}{4\\pi h} $$\n$$ F_3 = -(0)b = 0 $$\nThe force vector per unit length is thus $\\boldsymbol{F} = (0, -\\frac{\\mu b^2}{4\\pi h}, 0)$. This force is directed towards the free surface, indicating an attractive interaction. The magnitude of this force is:\n$$ |\\boldsymbol{F}| = \\frac{\\mu b^2}{4\\pi h} $$\nFrom this expression, it is evident that the magnitude of the force per unit length scales as $1/h$. This completes the required demonstration.

The real dislocation is at $(0, h)$, and its image is placed at $(0, -h)$. The force per unit length on the real dislocation is given by $\\mathbf{f} = (\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}^{\\text{image}} \\cdot \\mathbf{b}) \\times \\mathbf{t}$, where $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}^{\\text{image}}$ is the stress field of the image dislocation evaluated at the position of the real dislocation, $(0, h)$. The dislocation line direction is $\\mathbf{t} = \\mathbf{e}_z$.\n\n**1. Screw Dislocation ($\\mathbf{b}_{\\mathrm{s}}=b\\,\\mathbf{e}_{z}$)**\n\n*   **1a. Free Surface ($\\sigma_{iy}=0$ at $y=0$)**: To cancel the traction $\\sigma_{yz}$ at the free surface, an image screw dislocation of opposite Burgers vector, $\\mathbf{b}' = -b\\,\\mathbf{e}_z$, is placed at $(0, -h)$. The interaction between an anti-parallel screw dislocation pair is attractive. The stress component from the image at the real dislocation's core is $\\sigma_{xz}^{\\text{image}}(0,h) = \\frac{\\mu b}{4\\pi h}$. The Peach-Koehler force is:\n    $$ \\mathbf{f}_{\\mathrm{s,free}} = ( ( \\sigma_{xz}^{\\text{image}} b ) \\mathbf{e}_x ) \\times \\mathbf{e}_z = \\left( \\frac{\\mu b^2}{4\\pi h} \\mathbf{e}_x \\right) \\times \\mathbf{e}_z = -\\frac{\\mu b^2}{4\\pi h} \\mathbf{e}_y $$\n    The force is **attractive** (in the $-y$ direction) with magnitude $|\\mathbf{f}_{\\mathrm{s,free}}| = \\frac{\\mu b^2}{4\\pi h}$.\n\n*   **1b. Rigid Boundary ($u_{i}=0$ at $y=0$)**: To cancel the displacement $u_z$ at the rigid boundary, an image screw dislocation of the same Burgers vector, $\\mathbf{b}' = +b\\,\\mathbf{e}_z$, is placed at $(0, -h)$. The interaction between a parallel screw dislocation pair is repulsive. The stress component from the image at the real dislocation's core is $\\sigma_{xz}^{\\text{image}}(0,h) = -\\frac{\\mu b}{4\\pi h}$. The Peach-Koehler force is:\n    $$ \\mathbf{f}_{\\mathrm{s,rigid}} = ( ( \\sigma_{xz}^{\\text{image}} b ) \\mathbf{e}_x ) \\times \\mathbf{e}_z = \\left( -\\frac{\\mu b^2}{4\\pi h} \\mathbf{e}_x \\right) \\times \\mathbf{e}_z = +\\frac{\\mu b^2}{4\\pi h} \\mathbf{e}_y $$\n    The force is **repulsive** (in the $+y$ direction) with magnitude $|\\mathbf{f}_{\\mathrm{s,rigid}}| = \\frac{\\mu b^2}{4\\pi h}$.\n\n**2. Edge Dislocation ($\\mathbf{b}_{\\mathrm{e}}=b\\,\\mathbf{e}_{x}$)**\n\nThe Peach-Koehler force on an edge dislocation has components $f_x = b \\sigma_{yx}$ (glide force) and $f_y = -b \\sigma_{xx}$ (climb force). We are evaluating the force along the $y$-axis, which is the climb force. The stress components are due to the image dislocation.\n\n*   **2a. Free Surface ($\\sigma_{iy}=0$ at $y=0$)**: To satisfy the boundary conditions (primarily $\\sigma_{xy}=0$), an image edge dislocation of opposite Burgers vector, $\\mathbf{b}' = -b\\,\\mathbf{e}_x$, is placed at $(0, -h)$. The interaction between opposite-sign parallel edge dislocations is attractive. The stress $\\sigma_{xx}^{\\text{image}}$ at the real dislocation's core $(0, h)$ due to the image at $(0, -h)$ with Burgers vector $b'=-b$ is:\n    $$ \\sigma_{xx}^{\\text{image}}(0,h) = -\\frac{\\mu (-b)}{4\\pi(1-\\nu)h} = +\\frac{\\mu b}{4\\pi(1-\\nu)h} $$\n    The force is:\n    $$ \\mathbf{f}_{\\mathrm{e,free}} = -b \\sigma_{xx}^{\\text{image}}(0,h) \\mathbf{e}_y = -b \\left( \\frac{\\mu b}{4\\pi(1-\\nu)h} \\right) \\mathbf{e}_y = -\\frac{\\mu b^2}{4\\pi(1-\\nu)h} \\mathbf{e}_y $$\n    The force is **attractive** with magnitude $|\\mathbf{f}_{\\mathrm{e,free}}| = \\frac{\\mu b^2}{4\\pi(1-\\nu)h}$. Note that this simple image only cancels $\\sigma_{xy}$, not $\\sigma_{yy}$, but it yields the correct force.\n\n*   **2b. Rigid Boundary ($u_{i}=0$ at $y=0$)**: For a rigid boundary, dislocations of the same sign are used in the image construction, leading to repulsion. A simple image model uses an image edge dislocation of the same Burgers vector, $\\mathbf{b}' = +b\\,\\mathbf{e}_x$, at $(0, -h)$. The stress $\\sigma_{xx}^{\\text{image}}$ at the real dislocation's core $(0, h)$ due to the image with Burgers vector $b'=+b$ is:\n    $$ \\sigma_{xx}^{\\text{image}}(0,h) = -\\frac{\\mu (+b)}{4\\pi(1-\\nu)h} = -\\frac{\\mu b}{4\\pi(1-\\nu)h} $$\n    The force based on this simple image model is:\n    $$ \\mathbf{f}_{\\mathrm{e,rigid}} = -b \\sigma_{xx}^{\\text{image}}(0,h) \\mathbf{e}_y = -b \\left( -\\frac{\\mu b}{4\\pi(1-\\nu)h} \\right) \\mathbf{e}_y = +\\frac{\\mu b^2}{4\\pi(1-\\nu)h} \\mathbf{e}_y $$\n    The force is **repulsive** with magnitude $|\\mathbf{f}_{\\mathrm{e,rigid}}| = \\frac{\\mu b^2}{4\\pi(1-\\nu)h}$. It must be noted that this simple image construction for an edge dislocation at a rigid boundary does not fully satisfy the boundary condition $u_y=0$. The complete elastic solution is more complex.\n\n### Summary of Derived Results (based on simple image model)\n-   **Screw/Free**: Attractive, $|\\mathbf{f}| = \\frac{\\mu b^2}{4\\pi h}$.\n-   **Screw/Rigid**: Repulsive, $|\\mathbf{f}| = \\frac{\\mu b^2}{4\\pi h}$.\n-   **Edge/Free**: Attractive, $|\\mathbf{f}| = \\frac{\\mu b^2}{4\\pi(1-\\nu)h}$.\n-   **Edge/Rigid**: Repulsive, $|\\mathbf{f}| = \\frac{\\mu b^2}{4\\pi(1-\\nu)h}$.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n*   **A**: States that for both dislocations, the free surface attracts and the rigid boundary repels. This is **Correct**. It gives $|\\mathbf{f}|=\\mu b^{2}/(4\\pi h)$ for the screw dislocation in both cases. This is **Correct**. It gives $|\\mathbf{f}|=\\mu b^{2}/\\!\\left(4\\pi(1-\\nu)h\\right)$ for the edge/free case. This is **Correct**. It gives $|\\mathbf{f}|=\\mu b^{2}/\\!\\left(2\\pi(1-\\nu)h\\right)$ for the edge/rigid case. This differs from our simple image model derivation by a factor of $2$, but it correctly identifies the sign of the force and the dependencies on parameters. Given that the full solution for this case is complex, and the other three results are textbook-standard, this option is the strongest candidate. The result might arise from a complete elastic solution that is beyond the simple image model.\n\n*   **B**: States that the edge dislocation is repelled from the free surface. This is **Incorrect**.\n\n*   **C**: States that the screw dislocation is repelled from the free surface. This is **Incorrect**.\n\n*   **D**: States that magnitudes are equal for all cases, $|\\mathbf{f}|=\\mu b^{2}/(4\\pi h)$. This is **Incorrect** because the force on an edge dislocation depends on the Poisson ratio $\\nu$.\n\n*   **E**: States that for the edge dislocation, the free surface attraction has magnitude $|\\mathbf{f}|=\\mu b^{2}/\\!\\left(8\\pi(1-\\nu)h\\right)$. This is **Incorrect**; it is off by a factor of $1/2$ from the standard result. While it gives the magnitude for the rigid boundary that matches our simple model, its error on the canonical free-surface case is severe.\n\n### Conclusion\nOption A correctly states the signs of the forces in all cases and provides the correct magnitudes for three out of the four scenarios based on standard, widely accepted textbook results. The fourth scenario (edge dislocation at a rigid boundary) is known to be complex, and the simple image model is insufficient. Option A provides a magnitude that is twice that of the simple model. Compared to other options which contain more definitive errors on well-established results (e.g., incorrect signs or incorrect magnitude for the edge/free case), Option A is the most reliable choice.\n\n**Verdict for each option:**\n-   A: **Correct**\n-   B: **Incorrect**\n-   C: **Incorrect**\n-   D: **Incorrect**\n-   E: **Incorrect**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2630958"}, {"introduction": "This final practice advances from idealized half-spaces to the more realistic geometry of a finite thin film of thickness $H$, a prevalent structure in nanoscale devices.

This reference must be used to compute the error of the truncated image model and the error of the single-surface model.\n\nError quantification:\n- For each case, define the relative error as $e=\\left|\\frac{f_{\\text{approx}}-f_{\\text{exact}}}{f_{\\text{exact}}}\\right|$, where $f_{\\text{approx}}$ is the model prediction and $f_{\\text{exact}}$ is the exact film reference.\n- Express the error as a dimensionless decimal number (with no unit).\n\nImplementation specifics:\n- Consider a single screw dislocation located at $(x_0,y_0)=(0,y_0)$, with $y_0>0$.\n- Use shear modulus $\\mu=26\\times 10^{9}\\ \\text{Pa}$ and Burgers vector magnitude $b=0.25\\times 10^{-9}\\ \\text{m}$. These values are physically plausible for a face-centered cubic metal.\n- Use the following test suite to quantify how the modeling error changes with film thickness $H$ while holding the dislocation depth fixed at $y_0=1.0\\times 10^{-6}\\ \\text{m}$:\n  - Test case $1$: $H=2.5\\times 10^{-6}\\ \\text{m}$.\n  - Test case $2$: $H=5.0\\times 10^{-6}\\ \\text{m}$.\n  - Test case $3$: $H=1.0\\times 10^{-5}\\ \\text{m}$.\n  - Test case $4$: $H=1.0\\times 10^{-4}\\ \\text{m}$.\n- For the truncated two-surface model, use a symmetric truncation index $N=5$ (i.e., include all image dislocations generated by $n$ with $-N\\le n\\le N$), omitting the real dislocation itself.\n- All computations must be done in the plane at $x=x_0$ so that each image’s contribution to $\\sigma_{xz}$ at the real dislocation position depends only on the vertical separation.\n\nRequired outputs and format:\n- For each test case (in the order given above), compute two errors:\n  - The relative error of the single-surface approximation (that uses only the one image across $y=0$) with respect to the exact film solution.\n  - The relative error of the truncated two-surface image series with $N=5$ with respect to the exact film solution.\n- The final output of your program must be a single line containing a single list of $8$ floats in the following order:\n  - $\\big[e_{\\text{one}}(H_1), e_{\\text{trunc}}(H_1), e_{\\text{one}}(H_2), e_{\\text{trunc}}(H_2), e_{\\text{one}}(H_3), e_{\\text{trunc}}(H_3), e_{\\text{one}}(H_4), e_{\\text{trunc}}(H_4)\\big]$.\n- Each list element must be a decimal number (unitless).\n\nAngle units:\n- If any trigonometric function is used, its argument must be in radians.\n\nNotes:\n- Your derivation must begin from the stated physical base and must not assume any shortcut formulas beyond those bases. You must not provide direct plug-in formulas in this problem statement. The program you write must implement the modeling logic described above and produce the specified output in the exact format described.", "solution": "The problem statement is validated as scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. It poses a standard, albeit non-trivial, problem in the nanomechanics of materials, specifically concerning the elastic interaction of a crystal dislocation with free surfaces. The problem is self-contained and provides all necessary data for a unique solution. We therefore proceed with the derivation and computation.\n\nThe analysis is based on the theory of linear isotropic elasticity for anti-plane shear problems. A straight screw dislocation, with its line and Burgers vector parallel to the $z$-axis, induces only out-of-plane displacements $u_z(x,y)$. The only non-zero stress components are $\\sigma_{xz}$ and $\\sigma_{yz}$.\n\nFirst, we establish the stress field for a single screw dislocation with Burgers vector $\\mathbf{b} = b\\hat{\\mathbf{z}}$ located at $(x_s, y_s)$ in an infinite medium. This is a fundamental result. The stress components at a field point $(x,y)$ are:\n$$ \\sigma_{xz}(x, y) = -\\frac{\\mu b}{2\\pi} \\frac{y-y_s}{(x-x_s)^2 + (y-y_s)^2} $$\n$$ \\sigma_{yz}(x, y) = \\frac{\\mu b}{2\\pi} \\frac{x-x_s}{(x-x_s)^2 + (y-y_s)^2} $$\nwhere $\\mu$ is the shear modulus.\n\nThe force per unit length on a dislocation is given by the Peach-Koehler formula, $\\mathbf{f} = (\\boldsymbol{\\sigma} \\cdot \\mathbf{b}) \\times \\mathbf{t}$. For a screw dislocation with $\\mathbf{b} = b\\hat{\\mathbf{z}}$ and line sense $\\mathbf{t} = \\hat{\\mathbf{z}}$, positioned at $(x_0, y_0)$, under the influence of an external or image stress field $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}^{\\text{img}}$, the force components are:\n$$ f_x = b \\sigma_{yz}^{\\text{img}}(x_0, y_0) $$\n$$ f_y = -b \\sigma_{xz}^{\\text{img}}(x_0, y_0) $$\nThe problem specifies the dislocation is at $(x_0, y_0) = (0, y_0)$. We consider only image dislocations, which, by symmetry, are also located on the $y$-axis (i.e., at positions $(0, y_s)$). For any such image, its stress component $\\sigma_{yz}$ at $(0, y_0)$ is zero. Thus, the resultant force has only a $y$-component, $f_x=0$. The task reduces to calculating $f_y$ from the stress $\\sigma_{xz}^{\\text{img}}$ generated by various image configurations.\nThe force component is:\n$$ f_y = -b \\sum_{i} \\sigma_{xz}^{(i)}(0, y_0) = -b \\sum_{i} \\left( -\\frac{\\mu b_i}{2\\pi} \\frac{y_0 - y_i}{(0-0)^2 + (y_0 - y_i)^2} \\right) = \\frac{\\mu b}{2\\pi} \\sum_{i} \\frac{b_i}{y_0 - y_i} $$\nwhere the sum is over all image dislocations, each with Burgers vector magnitude $b_i$ at position $(0, y_i)$.\n\n1.  Single-Surface Model (Approximation)\nFor a semi-infinite medium occupying $y>0$ with a traction-free surface at $y=0$, the boundary condition is $\\sigma_{yz}|_{y=0}=0$. The stress $\\sigma_{yz}$ from the real dislocation at $(0, y_0)$ must be cancelled on this surface. This is achieved by placing a single image dislocation of opposite strength, $b_i = -b$, at $(0, -y_0)$.\nThe force on the real dislocation is due to this one image.\n$$ f_{y, \\text{one}} = \\frac{\\mu b}{2\\pi} \\frac{-b}{y_0 - (-y_0)} = -\\frac{\\mu b^2}{4\\pi y_0} $$\nThis is the attractive force pulling the dislocation towards the free surface.\n\n2.  Exact Film Solution (Reference)\nFor a film of thickness $H$ with traction-free surfaces at $y=0$ and $y=H$, an infinite series of images is required. A real dislocation at $(0, y_0)$ with strength $+b$ generates image series upon reflection:\n- Images of strength $-b$ at positions $y = 2nH - y_0$ for $n \\in \\mathbb{Z}$.\n- Images of strength $+b$ at positions $y = 2nH + y_0$ for $n \\in \\mathbb{Z}$.\nThe force on the real dislocation is the sum of contributions from all images. The real dislocation itself (case $n=0$ for the $+b$ series) is excluded from the sum.\n$$ f_{y, \\text{exact}} = \\frac{\\mu b^2}{2\\pi} \\left[ \\sum_{n=-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\frac{-1}{y_0 - (2nH - y_0)} + \\sum_{\\substack{n=-\\infty \\\\ n\\neq 0}}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{y_0 - (2nH + y_0)} \\right] $$\n$$ f_{y, \\text{exact}} = \\frac{\\mu b^2}{2\\pi} \\left[ \\sum_{n=-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\frac{-1}{2y_0 - 2nH} + \\sum_{\\substack{n=-\\infty \\\\ n\\neq 0}}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{-2nH} \\right] $$\nThe second sum, $\\sum_{n \\neq 0} 1/(-2nH)$, is zero under symmetric (Cauchy principal value) summation. We are left with the first sum.\n$$ f_{y, \\text{exact}} = -\\frac{\\mu b^2}{4\\pi H} \\sum_{n=-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{(y_0/H) - n} $$\nUsing the standard identity from complex analysis for the summation of a meromorphic function, $\\sum_{n=-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{z-n} = \\pi \\cot(\\pi z)$, we obtain the closed-form expression for the exact force:\n$$ f_{y, \\text{exact}} = -\\frac{\\mu b^2}{4\\pi H} \\left[ \\pi \\cot\\left(\\frac{\\pi y_0}{H}\\right) \\right] = -\\frac{\\mu b^2}{4H} \\cot\\left(\\frac{\\pi y_0}{H}\\right) $$\nThis result is the exact reference force for error computation.\n\n3.  Truncated Two-Surface Model (Approximation)\nThis model is a direct implementation of the infinite series for the force, but truncated to include only images corresponding to an index $n$ where $|n| \\le N$. Given $N=5$, the summation is over $n \\in \\{-5, -4, \\dots, 4, 5\\}$.\n$$ f_{y, \\text{trunc}} = \\frac{\\mu b^2}{2\\pi} \\left[ \\sum_{n=-N}^{N} \\frac{-1}{2y_0 - 2nH} + \\sum_{\\substack{n=-N \\\\ n\\neq 0}}^{N} \\frac{1}{-2nH} \\right] $$\nAs before, the second sum is zero. The first sum can be split into the $n=0$ term and a sum over $n = 1, \\dots, N$:\n$$ \\sum_{n=-N}^{N} \\frac{-1}{2y_0 - 2nH} = \\frac{-1}{2y_0} + \\sum_{n=1}^{N} \\left( \\frac{-1}{2y_0 - 2nH} + \\frac{-1}{2y_0 + 2nH} \\right) $$\n$$ = \\frac{-1}{2y_0} + \\sum_{n=1}^{N} \\frac{-(2y_0 + 2nH) - (2y_0 - 2nH)}{(2y_0 - 2nH)(2y_0 + 2nH)} = \\frac{-1}{2y_0} + \\sum_{n=1}^{N} \\frac{-4y_0}{4y_0^2 - 4(nH)^2} $$\n$$ = -\\frac{1}{2y_0} - y_0 \\sum_{n=1}^{N} \\frac{1}{y_0^2 - (nH)^2} $$\nSubstituting this back into the force expression:\n$$ f_{y, \\text{trunc}} = \\frac{\\mu b^2}{2\\pi} \\left[ -\\frac{1}{2y_0} - y_0 \\sum_{n=1}^{N} \\frac{1}{y_0^2 - (nH)^2} \\right] $$\n$$ f_{y, \\text{trunc}} = -\\frac{\\mu b^2}{4\\pi y_0} - \\frac{\\mu b^2 y_0}{2\\pi} \\sum_{n=1}^{N} \\frac{1}{y_0^2 - (nH)^2} $$\nThe first term is precisely $f_{y, \\text{one}}$. The summation provides corrections due to the additional images up to order $N$.\n\nError Quantification\nThe relative error $e$ for each approximation is computed as $e = |\\frac{f_{\\text{approx}} - f_{\\text{exact}}}{f_{\\text{exact}}}|$. Using the derived expressions, we will calculate $e_{\\text{one}}$ (single-surface model error) and $e_{\\text{trunc}}$ (truncated series model error) for each specified film thickness $H$. The constants are $\\mu = 26 \\times 10^9$ Pa, $b = 0.25 \\times 10^{-9}$ m, $y_0 = 1.0 \\times 10^{-6}$ m, and $N=5$.
