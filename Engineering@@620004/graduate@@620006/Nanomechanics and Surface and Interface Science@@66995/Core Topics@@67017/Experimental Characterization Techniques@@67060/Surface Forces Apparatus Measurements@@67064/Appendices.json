It does not exhibit any of the enumerated flaws. Therefore, I will proceed with a full derivation of the solution.\n\nThe solution is derived by systematically applying the fundamental principles stated in the problem.\n\nFirst, the signal, which is the normal interaction force $F$, is determined using Hooke’s law. For a linear spring, the force is directly proportional to its displacement. The normal force $F$ is thus given by the product of the normal spring constant $k_n$ and the static deflection $\\Delta z$.\n$$F = k_n \\Delta z$$\nSubstituting the provided values, ensuring consistent units are used. The deflection $\\Delta z = 0.8\\ \\mu\\mathrm{m}$ must be converted to meters: $\\Delta z = 0.8 \\times 10^{-6}\\ \\mathrm{m}$.\n$$F = (1800\\ \\mathrm{N/m}) \\times (0.8 \\times 10^{-6}\\ \\mathrm{m}) = 1440 \\times 10^{-6}\\ \\mathrm{N} = 1.44 \\times 10^{-3}\\ \\mathrm{N}$$\nAs requested, this force is expressed in millinewtons ($\\mathrm{mN}$).\n$$F = 1.44\\ \\mathrm{mN}$$\n\nSecond, the noise floor is determined. The problem describes white noise with a single-sided amplitude spectral density $S_z$. The root-mean-square (RMS) displacement noise, $\\delta z_{\\mathrm{rms}}$, is found by integrating the power spectral density, which is $S_z^2$, over the measurement bandwidth $B$ and then taking the square root. For white noise, $S_z$ is constant over the frequency range.\nThe mean-square displacement noise, $\\langle \\delta z^2 \\rangle$, is therefore:\n$$\\langle \\delta z^2 \\rangle = \\int_{0}^{B} S_z^2 df = S_z^2 \\int_{0}^{B} df = S_z^2 B$$\nThe RMS displacement noise is the square root of this value:\n$$\\delta z_{\\mathrm{rms}} = \\sqrt{S_z^2 B} = S_z \\sqrt{B}$$\nWe substitute the given values, converting $S_z$ to base SI units: $S_z = 0.5\\ \\mathrm{nm}/\\sqrt{\\mathrm{Hz}} = 0.5 \\times 10^{-9}\\ \\mathrm{m}/\\sqrt{\\mathrm{Hz}}$.\n$$\\delta z_{\\mathrm{rms}} = (0.5 \\times 10^{-9}\\ \\mathrm{m}/\\sqrt{\\mathrm{Hz}}) \\times \\sqrt{1\\ \\mathrm{Hz}} = 0.5 \\times 10^{-9}\\ \\mathrm{m}$$\nThis RMS displacement noise is translated into an RMS force noise, $\\delta F_{\\mathrm{rms}}$, via the same spring constant $k_n$. This is a linear propagation of error.\n$$\\delta F_{\\mathrm{rms}} = k_n \\delta z_{\\mathrm{rms}}$$\nSubstituting the values for $k_n$ and the calculated $\\delta z_{\\mathrm{rms}}$:\n$$\\delta F_{\\mathrm{rms}} = (1800\\ \\mathrm{N/m}) \\times (0.5 \\times 10^{-9}\\ \\mathrm{m}) = 900 \\times 10^{-9}\\ \\mathrm{N} = 0.9 \\times 10^{-6}\\ \\mathrm{N}$$\nAs requested, this force noise floor is expressed in micronewtons ($\\mu\\mathrm{N}$).\n$$\\delta F_{\\mathrm{rms}} = 0.9\\ \\mu\\mathrm{N}$$\n\nThird, the signal-to-noise ratio, $\\mathrm{SNR}$, is calculated. It is defined as the ratio of the signal magnitude to the noise magnitude.\n$$\\mathrm{SNR} = \\frac{F}{\\delta F_{\\mathrm{rms}}}$$\nUsing the derived symbolic expressions for $F$ and $\\delta F_{\\mathrm{rms}}$:\n$$\\mathrm{SNR} = \\frac{k_n \\Delta z}{k_n \\delta z_{\\mathrm{rms}}} = \\frac{k_n \\Delta z}{k_n (S_z \\sqrt{B})} = \\frac{\\Delta z}{S_z \\sqrt{B}}$$\nThis result demonstrates that for a system governed by Hooke's law, the force signal-to-noise ratio is fundamentally a displacement signal-to-noise ratio, independent of the spring's stiffness.

Your final numerical answer should be only the value of $W(D)$ in $\\mathrm{mJ}\\ \\mathrm{m}^{-2}$.", "solution": "The problem as stated is scientifically sound and well-posed. We proceed with the derivation and calculation.\n\nThe first task is to derive the relationship between the normal force $F(D)$ measured between two gently curved surfaces and the interaction free energy per unit area $W(D)$ between two parallel flat surfaces. This relationship is known as the Derjaguin approximation.\n\nWe begin by modeling the geometry. For two crossed cylinders of large radius, the local separation $h$ at a radial distance $r$ from the point of closest approach (where the separation is $D$) is given by the parabolic approximation:\n$$ h(r) \\approx D + \\frac{r^2}{2R_{\\mathrm{eff}}} $$\nwhere $R_{\\mathrm{eff}}$ is the effective radius of curvature. This approximation is valid under the assumption that the radii of curvature of the surfaces are much larger than the range of the interaction forces.\n\nThe Derjaguin approximation posits that the total force $F(D)$ between the curved surfaces can be found by integrating the force per unit area, which is the disjoining pressure $\\Pi(h)$, over the interaction area. The interaction area is divided into infinitesimal annular rings of area $dA = 2\\pi r \\, dr$. The force on each ring is parallel to the central axis, and thus the total force is the scalar sum:\n$$ F(D) = \\int_{A} \\Pi(h(r)) \\, dA = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\Pi(h(r)) \\, (2\\pi r \\, dr) $$\nThe integration limit is taken to infinity because the disjoining pressure $\\Pi(h)$ decays rapidly to zero at large separations $h$.\n\nThe disjoining pressure $\\Pi(D)$ is defined as the negative derivative of the interaction free energy per unit area $W(D)$ with respect to the separation $D$:\n$$ \\Pi(D) = - \\frac{d W(D)}{d D} $$\nThis is a fundamental thermodynamic relation. The sign convention implies that a positive, or repulsive, disjoining pressure arises from an interaction energy that decreases with increasing separation.\n\nTo evaluate the integral for $F(D)$, we change the variable of integration from $r$ to $h$. From the geometric relation $h = D + r^2 / (2R_{\\mathrm{eff}})$, we find $r^2 = 2R_{\\mathrm{eff}}(h - D)$. Differentiating gives $2r \\, dr = 2R_{\\mathrm{eff}} \\, dh$, which means the area element is $dA = 2\\pi r \\, dr = 2\\pi R_{\\mathrm{eff}} \\, dh$. The limits of integration also change: as $r$ goes from $0$ to $\\infty$, $h$ goes from $D$ to $\\infty$.\n\nSubstituting these into the force integral:\n$$ F(D) = \\int_{D}^{\\infty} \\Pi(h) \\, (2\\pi R_{\\mathrm{eff}} \\, dh) = 2\\pi R_{\\mathrm{eff}} \\int_{D}^{\\infty} \\Pi(h) \\, dh $$\nNow, we substitute the definition of the disjoining pressure:\n$$ F(D) = 2\\pi R_{\\mathrm{eff}} \\int_{D}^{\\infty} \\left( - \\frac{dW(h)}{dh} \\right) \\, dh = -2\\pi R_{\\mathrm{eff}} \\int_{D}^{\\infty} dW(h) $$\nThe integral is evaluated using the fundamental theorem of calculus:\n$$ F(D) = -2\\pi R_{\\mathrm{eff}} [W(h)]_{D}^{\\infty} = -2\\pi R_{\\mathrm{eff}} (W(\\infty) - W(D)) $$\nThe interaction free energy $W(D)$ is defined relative to infinite separation, so $W(\\infty) = 0$. This leads to the final relationship:\n$$ F(D) = -2\\pi R_{\\mathrm{eff}} (-W(D)) = 2\\pi R_{\\mathrm{eff}} W(D) $$\nThis is the required relationship, a central result in surface science.\n\nThe key assumptions made in this derivation are:\n$1$. Geometric Assumption: The surfaces are smoothly and gently curved, such that their radii of curvature are much larger than all other relevant length scales, including the separation $D$ and the decay length of the interaction potential ($R_{\\mathrm{eff}} \\gg D$). This validates the parabolic approximation of the gap geometry.\n$2$. Proximity Approximation (or Derjaguin Approximation): The total force is a sum of contributions from infinitesimally small, parallel, flat plate elements. This is justified when the radius of curvature is much larger than the range of the interaction forces, allowing for the pairwise additivity of forces.\n\nNext, we compute the value of $W(D)$ at the given separation. We rearrange the derived formula:\n$$ W(D) = \\frac{F(D)}{2\\pi R_{\\mathrm{eff}}} $$\nThe given parameters are:\nForce $F = -2.4 \\times 10^{-3} \\ \\mathrm{N}$\nEffective radius $R_{\\mathrm{eff}} = 2.0 \\ \\mathrm{cm} = 2.0 \\times 10^{-2} \\ \\mathrm{m}$\nSeparation $D = 5 \\ \\mathrm{nm} = 5 \\times 10^{-9} \\ \\mathrm{m}$\n\nSubstituting these values into the expression for $W(D)$:\n$$ W(D=5\\ \\mathrm{nm}) = \\frac{-2.4 \\times 10^{-3} \\ \\mathrm{N}}{2\\pi (2.0 \\times 10^{-2} \\ \\mathrm{m})} = \\frac{-2.4 \\times 10^{-3}}{4.0\\pi \\times 10^{-2}} \\ \\frac{\\mathrm{N}}{\\mathrm{m}} $$\nThe unit $\\mathrm{N}/\\mathrm{m}$ is equivalent to $\\mathrm{J}/\\mathrm{m}^2$.\n$$ W(5\\ \\mathrm{nm}) = - \\frac{0.06}{\\pi} \\ \\frac{\\mathrm{J}}{\\mathrm{m}^2} \\approx -0.01909859 \\ \\frac{\\mathrm{J}}{\\mathrm{m}^2} $$\nThe problem requires the answer in units of $\\mathrm{mJ}\\ \\mathrm{m}^{-2}$. Since $1 \\ \\mathrm{J} = 1000 \\ \\mathrm{mJ}$:\n$$ W(5\\ \\mathrm{nm}) \\approx -0.01909859 \\times 1000 \\ \\frac{\\mathrm{mJ}}{\\mathrm{m}^2} = -19.09859 \\ \\frac{\\mathrm{mJ}}{\\mathrm{m}^2} $$\nRounding to three significant figures, the result is:\n$$ W(5\\ \\mathrm{nm}) = -19.1 \\ \\mathrm{mJ}\\ \\mathrm{m}^{-2} $$\n\nFinally, we address the physical meaning and interpretation.\nPhysical meaning of $W(D)$: $W(D)$ represents the reversible work done per unit area to bring two large, flat, parallel surfaces from infinite separation to a finite separation $D$ through the intervening medium. It is the interaction free energy per unit area.\n\nSign Convention: The convention used is that an attractive interaction corresponds to a negative value of $W(D)$, and a repulsive interaction corresponds to a positive value. This is consistent with the standard thermodynamic definition where a spontaneous process (attraction) leads to a decrease in free energy. The force is related to the total potential energy $U(D)$ by $F = -dU/dD$. Since our derivation yields $F(D) \\propto W(D)$, a negative force (attractive, by convention pulling surfaces together in the negative $D$ direction) corresponds to a negative $W(D)$.\n\nInterpretation of the result: The calculated value is $W(5\\ \\mathrm{nm}) = -19.1 \\ \\mathrm{mJ}\\ \\mathrm{m}^{-2}$. The negative sign indicates that the free energy of the system is lower when the surfaces are at a separation of $5 \\ \\mathrm{nm}$ than when they are infinitely far apart. Therefore, the net interaction between the surfaces at this separation is attractive.
