In the Bardeen formalism, for elastic tunneling, this is expressed as an integral over energy $E$. We adopt the convention where the tip is at ground potential and its Fermi level $E_F$ is the reference energy, $E_F = 0$. The sample is biased at voltage $V$, so its Fermi level is at $eV$.\n\nFor a positive bias $V > 0$, electrons tunnel from the filled states of the tip to the empty states of the sample. The net current is given by:\n$$ I(V) \\propto \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} n_t(E) f(E) n_s(E+eV) [1-f(E+eV)] \\mathcal{T}(E,z) dE $$\nwhere contributions from the reverse process (sample to tip) have been incorporated into a single expression. A more common form used in low-temperature analysis is derived by considering the energy window opened by the bias. At $T=0$, the Fermi-Dirac distribution $f(E)$ is a step function (1 for $E<0$, 0 for $E>0$). The term $[f(\\tilde{E}) - f(\\tilde{E}+eV)]$ for tip-to-sample current becomes a window function of width $eV$. The standard result for the current at $T=0$ and $V>0$ is:\n$$ I(V) = C \\int_{0}^{eV} n_s(\\mathbf{r}_0, \\epsilon) n_t(\\epsilon - eV) \\mathcal{T}(\\epsilon, z) d\\epsilon $$\nHere, $\\epsilon$ represents energy with respect to the sample's Fermi level (before shifting), $n_s(\\mathbf{r}_0, \\epsilon)$ are the empty states of the sample being probed, and $n_t(\\epsilon - eV)$ are the filled states of the tip providing the electrons. The energy argument for $n_t$ ranges from $-eV$ to $0$, as required. $C$ is a constant incorporating fundamental constants and matrix elements.\n\nTo find the differential conductance $dI/dV$, we differentiate with respect to $V$ using the Leibniz integral rule:\n$$ \\frac{dI}{dV}(V) = \\frac{d}{dV} \\left( C \\int_{0}^{eV} n_s(\\mathbf{r}_0, \\epsilon) n_t(\\epsilon-eV) \\mathcal{T}(\\epsilon, z) d\\epsilon \\right) $$\nLet the integrand be $g(\\epsilon, V) = n_s(\\mathbf{r}_0, \\epsilon) n_t(\\epsilon - eV) \\mathcal{T}(\\epsilon, z)$. The derivative is:\n$$ \\frac{dI}{dV}(V) = C \\left( g(eV, V) \\cdot \\frac{d(eV)}{dV} + \\int_{0}^{eV} \\frac{\\partial g(\\epsilon, V)}{\\partial V} d\\epsilon \\right) $$\nThe first term is:\n$$ C \\cdot [n_s(\\mathbf{r}_0, eV) n_t(0) \\mathcal{T}(eV, z)] \\cdot e $$\nThe second term contains the partial derivative of the integrand:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial V} = n_s(\\mathbf{r}_0, \\epsilon) \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial V} [n_t(\\epsilon - eV) \\mathcal{T}(\\epsilon, z)] = n_s(\\mathbf{r}_0, \\epsilon) \\left( \\frac{d}{dE'}[n_t(E')\\mathcal{T}(E',z)] \\right)_{E'=\\epsilon-eV} \\cdot (-e) $$\nCombining these, we get the exact expression for $dI/dV$ at $T=0$:\n$$ \\frac{dI}{dV}(V) = C e \\left( n_s(\\mathbf{r}_0, eV) n_t(0) \\mathcal{T}(eV, z) - \\int_{0}^{eV} n_s(\\mathbf{r}_0, \\epsilon) \\left. \\frac{d}{dE'} [n_t(E')\\mathcal{T}(E',z)] \\right|_{E'=\\epsilon-eV} d\\epsilon \\right) $$\nThis expression explicitly shows the roles of $n_s$, $n_t$, and $\\mathcal{T}$.\n\nThe usual proportionality $dI/dV \\propto n_s(\\mathbf{r}_0, E_F + eV)$ emerges under specific simplifying assumptions. If the tip DOS $n_t(E)$ and the transmission factor $\\mathcal{T}(E,z)$ are slowly varying with energy over the range of interest, their derivative is approximately zero:\n$$ \\frac{d}{dE'} [n_t(E')\\mathcal{T}(E',z)] \\approx 0 $$\nIn this case, the integral term in the expression for $dI/dV$ vanishes. The expression simplifies to:\n$$ \\frac{dI}{dV}(V) \\approx C e \\cdot n_s(\\mathbf{r}_0, eV) n_t(0) \\mathcal{T}(eV, z) $$\nIf, furthermore, the energy dependence of $\\mathcal{T}(eV,z)$ is negligible over the bias range, we can approximate $\\mathcal{T}(eV,z) \\approx \\mathcal{T}(0,z)$. Since $n_t(0)$ and $\\mathcal{T}(0,z)$ are constants for a given tip and setpoint, we obtain the celebrated result:\n$$ \\frac{dI}{dV}(V) \\propto n_s(\\mathbf{r}_0, eV) $$\nDeviations from this simple proportionality arise when $n_t(E)$ or $\\mathcal{T}(E,z)$ vary rapidly with energy. The non-zero derivative term inside the integral introduces a distortion. This distortion is a convolution-like term that mixes the properties of the sample LDOS over the entire energy window $[0, eV]$ with the energy-derivative of the tip's spectral function.\n\n### Task 2: Distortion Analysis\n\nThe problem asks for an analysis of the distortion using specific forms for $n_s$ and $n_t$, and to write a \"leading-order expression... in terms of $n_t(eV)$ and $n_s(\\mathbf{r}_0, eV)$\". As shown in Task 1, the exact expression is not a simple function of $n_s(eV)$ and $n_t(eV)$. The structure of the problem suggests utilizing a common, albeit phenomenological, model where the differential conductance is approximated by the convolution of the two densities of states:\n$$ \\frac{dI}{dV}(V) \\propto (n_s * n_t)(eV) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} n_s(E) n_t(eV - E) dE $$\nThis model, while not rigorously derived from first principles in this simplified form, correctly captures the qualitative nature of the distortion where features from both tip and sample appear in the measured spectrum. Let $E' = eV$.\n$$ \\frac{dI}{dV}(E') \\propto \\left( (n_{s0} + A_s L_s) * (n_{t0} + A_t L_t) \\right)(E') $$\nwhere $L_s(E) = L(E-E_s, \\Gamma_s)$ and $L_t(E) = L(E-E_t, \\Gamma_t)$.\nIgnoring issues with convoluting constant backgrounds, the main features arise from:\n$$ \\frac{dI}{dV}(E') \\propto n_{t0} A_s L_s(E') + n_{s0} A_t L_t(E') + A_s A_t (L_s * L_t)(E') $$\nThis expression contains three distinct features:\n1.  **Scaled Sample Spectrum**: $n_{t0} A_s L_s(E')$ is the sample's Lorentzian peak, $L(E' - E_s, \\Gamma_s)$, centered at $E_s = +50\\,\\mathrm{meV}$ with width $\\Gamma_s = +10\\,\\mathrm{meV}$. This is the \"intrinsic\" feature, although its amplitude is scaled by the tip's background DOS, $n_{t0}$.\n2.  **Imprinted Tip Spectrum**: $n_{s0} A_t L_t(E')$ is the tip's Lorentzian peak, $L(E' - E_t, \\Gamma_t)$, centered at $E_t = +100\\,\\mathrm{meV}$ with width $\\Gamma_t = +30\\,\\mathrm{meV}$. This is a \"tip-imprinted\" artifact, a direct mapping of the tip's spectral feature onto the measured data.\n3.  **Convolution Artifact**: $A_s A_t (L_s * L_t)(E')$. The convolution of two Lorentzians is another Lorentzian whose center is the sum of the individual centers and whose width is the sum of the individual widths. This feature is a new peak at $E_s + E_t = 50 + 100 = 150\\,\\mathrm{meV}$, with a width of $\\Gamma_s + \\Gamma_t = 10 + 30 = 40\\,\\mathrm{meV}$. This is a \"ghost\" peak, an artifact of the convolution of the two non-ideal spectral functions.\n\n**Qualitative and Quantitative Distortion**: The ideal measurement would only show the intrinsic sample peak at $50\\,\\mathrm{meV}$. The structured tip DOS distorts this in three ways:\n-   It adds a spurious peak at $100\\,\\mathrm{meV}$ that originates purely from the tip.\n-   It adds a third \"ghost\" peak at $150\\,\\mathrm{meV}$.\n-   The overall measured spectrum is a superposition of these three peaks, making it a poor representation of the true sample LDOS. The relative heights of these features depend on the amplitudes $A_s, A_t$ and backgrounds $n_{s0}, n_{t0}$.\n\n### Task 3: Reference Calibration Procedure\n\nThe goal is to recover the true sample LDOS, $n_s$, from a measurement contaminated by the tip DOS, $n_t$, and the transmission probability, $\\mathcal{T}$. As revealed in Task 1, this is generally not possible via a simple algebraic operation because the relationship is not a simple product. However, a \"first-order\" correction scheme is possible if we make the approximation that the differential conductance is a product of the constituent functions:\n$$ \\left(\\frac{dI}{dV}\\right)_i(V) \\approx K \\cdot n_i(eV) \\cdot n_t(eV) \\cdot \\mathcal{T}(eV, z_i) $$\nThis simplified model assumes the primary effect of the tip DOS is multiplicative. While this neglects the convolution effects detailed in Task 2, it forms the basis of the most common calibration technique.\n\nTo cancel the unknown factors $n_t(eV)$ and $\\mathcal{T}(eV, z)$, one can perform a reference measurement.\nThe procedure is as follows:\n1.  **Measure the Sample**: Acquire the spectrum $(dI/dV)_{\\mathrm{sample}}(V)$ on the sample of interest. The tip is at a distance $z_{\\mathrm{sample}}$ set by $(V_{\\mathrm{set}}, I_{\\mathrm{set}})$.\n    $$ \\left(\\frac{dI}{dV}\\right)_{\\mathrm{sample}}(V) \\approx K \\cdot n_s(\\mathbf{r}_0, eV) \\cdot n_t(eV) \\cdot \\mathcal{T}(eV, z_{\\mathrm{sample}}) $$\n2.  **Measure a Reference**: Move the same tip to a reference surface with a known, preferably featureless (constant), LDOS, $n_{\\mathrm{ref}}(E)$. Acquire the reference spectrum $(dI/dV)_{\\mathrm{ref}}(V)$.\n    $$ \\left(\\frac{dI}{dV}\\right)_{\\mathrm{ref}}(V) \\approx K \\cdot n_{\\mathrm{ref}}(eV) \\cdot n_t(eV) \\cdot \\mathcal{T}(eV, z_{\\mathrm{ref}}) $$\n3.  **Ensure Identical Conditions**: For the cancellation to work, the unknown functions $n_t(eV)$ and $\\mathcal{T}(eV, z)$ must be identical in both measurements.\n    -   The tip must not change, so $n_t(eV)$ is the same. This should be verified by re-measuring the reference after the sample.\n    -   The tip-sample distance $z$ must be the same ($z_{\\mathrm{sample}} = z_{\\mathrm{ref}}$), and the local environment affecting transmission (e.g., work function) must be similar. This ensures $\\mathcal{T}(eV, z)$ is the same. Matching $z$ is attempted by using the *exact same setpoint* $(V_{\\mathrm{set}}, I_{\\mathrm{set}})$ for both measurements. This is a good approximation if the reference and sample have similar integrated DOS and work functions.\n4.  **Compute the Ratio**: Divide the sample spectrum by the reference spectrum:\n    $$ \\frac{\\left(dI/dV\\right)_{\\mathrm{sample}}(V)}{\\left(dI/dV\\right)_{\\mathrm{ref}}(V)} \\approx \\frac{K \\cdot n_s(\\mathbf{r}_0, eV) \\cdot n_t(eV) \\cdot \\mathcal{T}(eV, z)}{K \\cdot n_{\\mathrm{ref}}(eV) \\cdot n_t(eV) \\cdot \\mathcal{T}(eV, z)} = \\frac{n_s(\\mathbf{r}_0, eV)}{n_{\\mathrm{ref}}(eV)} $$\n5.  **Recover Sample LDOS**: Rearrange the equation to solve for $n_s$:\n    $$ n_s^{\\mathrm{corr}}(\\mathbf{r}_0, eV) \\approx \\frac{\\left(dI/dV\\right)_{\\mathrm{sample}}(V)}{\\left(dI/dV\\right)_{\\mathrm{ref}}(V)} \\cdot n_{\\mathrm{ref}}(eV) $$\nIf $n_{\\mathrm{ref}}(E)$ is constant, the corrected sample LDOS is simply proportional to the ratio of the measured conductances.\n\n### Evaluation of Options\n\n**A. Acquire $dI/dV(V)$ on a clean... noble metal terrace... using exactly the same tip... setpoint...compute $n_s^{\\mathrm{corr}}(\\mathbf{r}_0,E) \\propto \\dfrac{\\left(dI/dV\\right)_{\\mathrm{sample}}(E)}{\\left(dI/dV\\right)_{\\mathrm{ref}}(E)} \\, n_{\\mathrm{ref}}(E)$...**\nThis option perfectly describes the procedure derived in Task 3. It correctly identifies the need for a reference with known and flat LDOS (noble metal terrace), the necessity of matching all experimental parameters including the setpoint to match $z$, the correct formula for the corrected LDOS, the underlying assumption about similar work functions, and the good practice of re-verifying the tip. **Correct**.\n\n**B. Normalize each spectrum by the setpoint conductance... $\\left(dI/dV\\right)(V) / \\left(I_{\\mathrm{set}}/V_{\\mathrm{set}}\\right)$...**\nThis procedure involves dividing the entire spectrum (a function of $V$) by a single number, $I_{\\mathrm{set}}/V_{\\mathrm{set}}$. This only rescales the spectrum's magnitude; it does not alter its shape. It cannot remove any energy-dependent features originating from the tip DOS. The claim that this removes the energy dependence of the tip DOS is false. **Incorrect**.\n\n**C. Increase the setpoint current by a large factor to reduce the vacuum gap... which suppresses the influence of tip DOS variations...**\nReducing the tip-sample distance $z$ moves the junction from the tunneling regime toward the point-contact regime. While this strongly increases the overall signal, there is no physical principle stating that it selectively suppresses the contributions of the tip DOS. In the limit of a point contact, the conductance is still a function of both tip and sample DOS. This is not a calibration method. **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. Use a superconducting reference surface with an unknown gap... then divide... to eliminate the tip DOS without needing the reference LDOS.**\nThis procedure is entirely flawed. A superconductor provides a highly structured DOS (gap and coherence peaks), not the flat reference needed for simple division. Dividing by such a spectrum would introduce severe artifacts (e.g., artificial singularities at the gap edges) into the sample data. Furthermore, claiming the reference LDOS is not needed is nonsensical, as the division eliminates the product $n_{\\mathrm{ref}} \\cdot n_t$; one cannot isolate $n_s$ without knowledge of $n_{\\mathrm{ref}}$. Finally, using \"any convenient setpoint\" violates the critical condition of matching the tip-sample distance. **Incorrect**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2783079"}]}
