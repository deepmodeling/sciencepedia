The model of a cantilever as a damped, driven harmonic oscillator is a fundamental and standard approximation in the study of amplitude-modulation AFM. The problem is well-posed, as it seeks the steady-state solution to a second-order linear ordinary differential equation with a sinusoidal forcing term, for which a unique, stable solution is known to exist.

A solution will be derived.\n\n### Derivation of Solution\nThe behavior of the AFM cantilever is described by the equation of a driven damped harmonic oscillator with an additional tip-sample interaction force, $F_{\\mathrm{ts}}$.\n$$m\\ddot{z} + \\frac{m\\omega_0}{Q}\\dot{z} + k z = F_{\\mathrm{drive}}(t) + F_{\\mathrm{ts}}(z, \\dot{z})$$\nwhere $m$ is the effective mass, $k$ is the spring constant, $\\omega_0=2\\pi f_0$ is the free angular resonance frequency, and $Q$ is the quality factor. The cantilever is driven by a force $F_{\\mathrm{drive}}(t)=F_{d}\\cos(\\omega_0 t)$ at the free resonance frequency. The tip-sample interaction force $F_{\\mathrm{ts}}$ can be separated into a conservative part (dependent on position $z$, related to elastic and van der Waals forces) and a dissipative part (dependent on velocity $\\dot{z}$, related to viscoelasticity and adhesion hysteresis).\n\nWe analyze the physical meaning of the three recorded channels:\n\n1.  **Phase Lag ($\\phi$)**: The phase lag $\\phi$ of the cantilever's oscillation relative to the drive signal is nominally $90^{\\circ}$ when driven at resonance without tip-sample interaction. The presence of $F_{\\mathrm{ts}}$ alters the cantilever dynamics.\n    -   A net attractive conservative interaction effectively softens the cantilever, reducing its effective resonance frequency. When driving at $f_0$, the system is now driven above its new resonance, resulting in a phase lag $\\phi < 90^{\\circ}$.\n    -   A net repulsive conservative interaction effectively stiffens the cantilever, increasing its effective resonance frequency. When driving at $f_0$, the system is driven below its new resonance, resulting in $\\phi > 90^{\\circ}$.\n\n2.  **Drive Amplitude ($V_{\\mathrm{drive}}$)**: In steady-state operation at fixed amplitude $A_{\\mathrm{sp}}$, the power input from the drive must balance the total power dissipated. The total power dissipated, $P_{\\mathrm{total}}$, is the sum of intrinsic cantilever damping, $P_{\\mathrm{intrinsic}}$, and dissipation due to tip-sample interactions, $P_{\\mathrm{ts}}$.\n    $$P_{\\mathrm{drive}} = P_{\\mathrm{intrinsic}} + P_{\\mathrm{ts}}$$\n    The input power is $P_{\\mathrm{drive}} \\propto V_{\\mathrm{drive}}$. The intrinsic dissipation is $P_{\\mathrm{intrinsic}} = \\frac{k\\omega_0 A_{\\mathrm{sp}}^2}{2Q}$. The tip-sample dissipation $P_{\\mathrm{ts}}$ is the energy per cycle lost to the sample. A higher required $V_{\\mathrm{drive}}$ to maintain the same $A_{\\mathrm{sp}}$ implies a larger tip-sample dissipation $P_{\\mathrm{ts}}$.\n\n3.  **Apparent Topography**: The feedback loop maintains $A_{\\mathrm{sp}}$ by adjusting the vertical position of the sample stage (Z-piezo). If the tip encounters an interaction that is more repulsive (or less attractive), its oscillation amplitude will momentarily decrease. To restore $A_{\\mathrm{sp}}$, the feedback loop retracts the sample, a change that is recorded as an increase in the apparent height. Therefore, a region appearing \"higher\" is one that exerts a more repulsive average force on the tip.\n\n### Analysis of Experimental Data\n\n-   At $r=0.95$ (weak interaction), $\\phi_{\\mathrm{X}} \\approx \\phi_{\\mathrm{Y}} < 90^{\\circ}$, $V_{\\mathrm{drive,X}} \\approx V_{\\mathrm{drive,Y}}$, and topographic offset is zero. This regime is dominated by long-range attractive forces and shows minimal dissipation and no discernible difference between X and Y, confirming their true height is identical.\n\n-   At $r=0.75$ (moderate interaction), the system shows significant contrast:\n    -   $\\phi_{\\mathrm{X}} = 97^{\\circ} > 90^{\\circ}$ and $\\phi_{\\mathrm{Y}} = 87^{\\circ} < 90^{\\circ}$. This indicates that the interaction on region X is net repulsive, while on region Y it is net attractive.\n    -   $V_{\\mathrm{drive,X}} = 1.15\\ \\mathrm{V} > V_{\\mathrm{drive,Y}} = 1.02\\ \\mathrm{V}$. This demonstrates that region X is more dissipative than region Y.\n    -   X appears $0.6\\ \\mathrm{nm}$ higher than Y. This confirms that the average tip-sample force is more repulsive on X than on Y.\n\n-   At $r=0.55$ (strong interaction), the trends are amplified:\n    -   $\\phi_{\\mathrm{X}} = 118^{\\circ}$ and $\\phi_{\\mathrm{Y}} = 102^{\\circ}$. Both are now in the repulsive regime, but the phase lag on X is much larger, indicating a far more repulsive interaction.\n    -   $V_{\\mathrm{drive,X}} = 1.40\\ \\mathrm{V} \\gg V_{\\mathrm{drive,Y}} = 1.05\\ \\mathrm{V}$. The dissipation on region X is substantially greater than on region Y.\n    -   X appears $1.4\\ \\mathrm{nm}$ higher, confirming the much more repulsive nature of the interaction on X.\n\n**Synthesis**: The data consistently shows that region X is both more repulsive (stiffer and/or less adhesive) and more dissipative (e.g., higher viscoelastic loss) than region Y.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A) True topography (height) differences only.**\nThis is explicitly contradicted by the problem statement (\"Assume that the local static height of X and Y is truly identical\") and the experimental observation that the apparent topography offset is zero at weak interaction ($r=0.95$).\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**B) Adhesion or viscoelastic dissipation differences dominate the contrast, not stiffness.**\nThis option proposes that dissipation is the primary source of contrast, and that conservative force differences are due to adhesion, not stiffness (elastic modulus).\n-   **Dissipation**: The drive amplitude data ($V_{\\mathrm{drive,X}} \\gg V_{\\mathrm{drive,Y}}$) shows a large difference in energy dissipation. This is a very strong contrast signal, supporting the idea that dissipation differences are significant, likely dominant. Such dissipation in polymers arises from viscoelastic losses or adhesion hysteresis.\n-   **Conservative forces (\"not stiffness\")**: The phase and topography data ($\\phi_X > \\phi_Y$, X appears higher) indicate a more repulsive interaction on X. This can arise from X being stiffer (higher elastic modulus) or less adhesive than Y. This option suggests the latter. It is physically plausible for two polymers to have similar elastic moduli but different surface energies (leading to different adhesion forces). In such a case, lower adhesion on X would make it behave as a more repulsive surface compared to a high-adhesion Y, explaining the phase and topography data without invoking differences in stiffness.\nThis option provides a self-consistent physical picture that explains all observations: the large dissipation contrast reflects differences in viscoelasticity/adhesion hysteresis, while the conservative force contrast arises from differences in adhesion. This is a common scenario in polymer science.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**C) Conservative stiffness (elastic modulus) differences dominate the contrast with negligible dissipation.**\nThis option claims that dissipation effects are negligible. The data from the drive amplitude channel directly refutes this. For example, at $r=0.55$, the drive voltage required for X ($1.40\\ \\mathrm{V}$) is $33\\%$ higher than for Y ($1.05\\ \\mathrm{V}$), indicating a very significant difference in energy dissipation. Therefore, dissipation is not negligible.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D) An instrumental frequency detuning artifact only, independent of material properties, dominates the contrast.**\nAn instrumental artifact like a fixed frequency detuning would affect both regions X and Y. While it could shift the baseline phase values, it could not by itself generate the substantial and systematic *differences* in phase, drive amplitude, and apparent topography observed between the two chemically distinct materials. The contrast is clearly material-dependent.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2782767"}]}
