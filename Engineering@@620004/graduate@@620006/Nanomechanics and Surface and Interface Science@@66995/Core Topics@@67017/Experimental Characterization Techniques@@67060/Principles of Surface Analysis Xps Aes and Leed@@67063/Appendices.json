The derivation must begin from fundamental principles of energy conservation, accounting for the energy level alignment between the sample and the electron energy analyzer.\n\nLet us define the relevant energy levels. We set the reference energy at the Fermi level, $E_F = 0$. The binding energy $E_B^F(\\text{level})$ of an electron in a given core level is the energy required to remove that electron from its level to the Fermi level. The sample work function $\\phi_S$ is the energy difference between the local vacuum level of the sample, $E_{vac,S}$, and the Fermi level, such that $E_{vac,S} = E_F + \\phi_S = \\phi_S$. The analyzer has a work function $\\phi_A$, defining its vacuum level $E_{vac,A} = E_F + \\phi_A = \\phi_A$. A critical condition is that the sample and analyzer are in electrical contact, which forces their Fermi levels to align: $E_{F,S} = E_{F,A}$. We denote this common level as $E_F$.\n\nThe Auger process involves three electronic states. For a $KLL$ transition, let us specify the process as $KL_1L_2$.\n1.  An initial hole exists in the deep core level $K$. This could be created by an incident electron or X-ray beam.\n2.  An electron from a shallower level, say $L_1$, transitions to fill the $K$ hole.\n3.  The energy released from this de-excitation is transferred to a third electron, in this case from the $L_2$ level, which is then ejected from the atom.\n\nThe problem states that we can neglect many-body and relaxation effects. This is a crucial simplification, allowing us to use a one-electron energy picture. The energy released by the $L_1 \\to K$ transition, within the solid, is the difference in their binding energies relative to the Fermi level:\n$$\n\\Delta E = E_B^F(K) - E_B^F(L_1)\n$$\nThis energy is imparted to the electron in the $L_2$ orbital. The initial energy of this electron, relative to the Fermi level, is $-E_B^F(L_2)$. After receiving the energy $\\Delta E$, its new energy, which is its kinetic energy relative to the Fermi level ($E_{K, \\text{rel } F}$), is:\n$$\nE_{K, \\text{rel } F} = -E_B^F(L_2) + \\Delta E = -E_B^F(L_2) + (E_B^F(K) - E_B^F(L_1))\n$$\n$$\nE_{K, \\text{rel } F} = E_B^F(K) - E_B^F(L_1) - E_B^F(L_2)\n$$\nThis expression represents the total energy of the Auger electron within the solid, referenced to the common Fermi level $E_F$. As the electron travels from the sample surface to the analyzer entrance, its total energy is conserved.\n\nThe electron energy analyzer measures the kinetic energy of the electron, $E_{K, \\text{meas}}$, with respect to the analyzer's vacuum level, $E_{vac,A}$. The potential energy of an electron at the analyzer's vacuum level is $\\phi_A$ (relative to $E_F=0$). The total energy of the electron as it enters the analyzer is the sum of its measured kinetic energy and its potential energy:\n$$\nE_{\\text{total}} = E_{K, \\text{meas}} + \\phi_A\n$$\nBy conservation of energy, this total energy must be equal to the electron's total energy when it left the sample, which we found to be $E_{K, \\text{rel } F}$.

First, we must calculate the binding energies for the oxidized state using the given chemical shifts, $\\Delta E_B$.

This practice focuses on spin-orbit splitting, a fundamental quantum mechanical effect that generates characteristic doublets for core levels with non-zero orbital angular momentum (e.g., $p$, $d$, $f$ shells). You will apply the principles of angular momentum coupling to predict the statistical area ratio of a spin-orbit doublet and explore the physical mechanisms that can cause deviations from this ideal value. This task [@problem_id:2785119] solidifies your ability to connect quantum theory to the quantitative analysis of XPS peak shapes and intensities.", "problem": "In X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS), the spin–orbit interaction splits a core level with orbital angular momentum quantum number $l$ into two components characterized by total angular momentum $j=l\\pm s$, where $s$ is the electron spin.

Assume a polycrystalline sample so that any crystalline anisotropy averages out, and that lifetime broadening and extrinsic loss processes are identical for the two components.\n\nStarting from the fundamental definitions of angular momentum coupling and state degeneracy, compute the expected statistical area ratio of the $3d_{5/2}$ and $3d_{3/2}$ XPS components.

No rounding is required.", "solution": "The problem asks for three things: first, the computation of the statistical area ratio of the $3d_{5/2}$ and $3d_{3/2}$ XPS components; second, a description of the photoemission intensity in the dipole framework; and third, an explanation of two mechanisms causing deviation from the statistical ratio.\n\nPart 1: The Statistical Area Ratio\nThe intensity of an XPS peak, corresponding to the creation of a hole in a specific core level, is, in the simplest approximation, proportional to the number of ways a hole can be created in that level. For a filled subshell, this is equivalent to the degeneracy of the final hole state. The degeneracy of an atomic state characterized by the total angular momentum quantum number $j$ is given by $g_j = 2j+1$.\n\nFor the $3d$ core level, the orbital angular momentum quantum number is $l=2$. The electron has spin $s=1/2$. The spin-orbit interaction couples these momenta to produce two possible total angular momentum states for the core hole, characterized by the quantum number $j$:\n1. The higher-multiplicity state: $j_1 = l+s = 2 + \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{5}{2}$. This is the $3d_{5/2}$ component.\n2. The lower-multiplicity state: $j_2 = l-s = 2 - \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{3}{2}$. This is the $3d_{3/2}$ component.\n\nThe degeneracy of each of these states is calculated as follows:\n- For the $3d_{5/2}$ component ($j=\\frac{5}{2}$): $g_{5/2} = 2\\left(\\frac{5}{2}\\right) + 1 = 5 + 1 = 6$.\n- For the $3d_{3/2}$ component ($j=\\frac{3}{2}$): $g_{3/2} = 2\\left(\\frac{3}{2}\\right) + 1 = 3 + 1 = 4$.\n\nAssuming the photoionization cross-section per state is identical for both final hole states, the ratio of the integrated peak areas, $A$, is equal to the ratio of their degeneracies:\n$$\n\\frac{A(3d_{5/2})}{A(3d_{3/2})} = \\frac{g_{5/2}}{g_{3/2}} = \\frac{6}{4} = \\frac{3}{2}\n$$\nThis is the expected statistical ratio.\n\nPart 2: Dipole Selection Rule Framework\nThe intensity of the photoemission process is governed by Fermi's Golden Rule. In the electric dipole approximation, the transition rate from an initial core state $|\\psi_i\\rangle$ to a final state $|\\psi_f\\rangle$ (composed of a photoelectron in a continuum state and the system with a core hole) is proportional to the square of the dipole matrix element, $|\\langle\\psi_f|\\mathbf{\\epsilon} \\cdot \\mathbf{r}|\\psi_i\\rangle|^2$, where $\\mathbf{\\epsilon}$ is the polarization vector of the light and $\\mathbf{r}$ is the position operator.\n\nThe total measured area for a peak corresponding to a final hole state $nl_j$ is obtained by summing over all degenerate final states, averaging over initial states, and integrating the differential cross-section over the solid angle of the analyzer. For a polycrystalline sample and unpolarized light, the expression for the area simplifies and is proportional to the total photoionization cross-section for that sub-level, $\\sigma_{nl_j}(h\\nu)$.\n$$\nA(nl_j) \\propto (2j+1) \\times \\sigma_{nl_j}^{\\text{per state}}(h\\nu)\n$$\nwhere $\\sigma_{nl_j}^{\\text{per state}}$ is the effective cross-section per magnetic substate. This cross-section itself depends on radial dipole matrix elements connecting the initial $nl$ orbital to the allowed final continuum channels. For an initial $d$ orbital ($l=2$), the dipole selection rules ($\\Delta l = \\pm 1$) permit transitions to final continuum states with orbital angular momentum $l'=1$ ($p$-wave) or $l'=3$ ($f$-wave). The total cross-section is a sum of contributions from these channels, and the branching ratio between them depends on the photon energy. The cross-sections for creating a hole in the $j=l \\pm 1/2$ states are not, in general, identical because the coupling to the $l \\pm 1$ final state channels is weighted differently for the two spin-orbit components. This dependence is the origin of the deviations from the simple statistical model.\n\nPart 3: Mechanisms for Deviation from the Statistical Ratio\nThe statistical ratio of $3/2$ relies on the assumption that the photoionization cross-section per state is the same for the $3d_{5/2}$ and $3d_{3/2}$ components. In reality, this is not strictly true. Two distinct physical mechanisms can cause the measured ratio to deviate from this value.\n\n1.  **Kinetic Energy Dependence of the Photoionization Cross-Section.** The two spin-orbit components have different binding energies, $E_B$, due to the spin-orbit splitting energy, $\\Delta E_{SO}$, where $E_B(3d_{3/2}) > E_B(3d_{5/2})$. Consequently, the photoelectrons ejected from these two levels possess different kinetic energies:\n    $$\n    E_{kin}(3d_{5/2}) = h\\nu - E_B(3d_{5/2})\n    $$\n    $$\n    E_{kin}(3d_{3/2}) = h\\nu - E_B(3d_{3/2}) = E_{kin}(3d_{5/2}) - \\Delta E_{SO}\n    $$\n    The photoionization cross-section, $\\sigma(E_{kin})$, is a function of the photoelectron kinetic energy. The wavefunctions of the final continuum states depend on this energy, which in turn affects the value of the dipole matrix elements. Because $E_{kin}(3d_{5/2}) \\neq E_{kin}(3d_{3/2})$, the cross-sections per state are also different: $\\sigma_{3d_{5/2}} \\neq \\sigma_{3d_{3/2}}$. The measured area ratio is correctly given by $\\frac{A_{5/2}}{A_{3/2}} = \\frac{g_{5/2}}{g_{3/2}} \\frac{\\sigma_{5/2}}{\\sigma_{3/2}}$. If $\\sigma(E_{kin})$ is not constant over the small energy range $\\Delta E_{SO}$, the measured ratio will deviate from the statistical value of $3/2$. This effect is most significant when the cross-section varies rapidly with photon energy, such as near a Cooper minimum.\n\n2.  **State-Dependent Final State Decay Channels (Coster-Kronig Auger Decay).** This mechanism arises from processes that occur *after* the initial photoionization event. The problem statement includes the idealization of identical lifetime broadening for calculating the statistical ratio. However, to explain real-world deviations, one must consider phenomena that violate this idealization. A prominent example is Coster-Kronig (CK) Auger decay, an exceptionally fast, radiationless decay process where the core hole is filled by an electron from a subshell within the same principal shell. It is possible for a CK decay channel to be energetically allowed for the hole state with higher binding energy ($3d_{3/2}$) but forbidden for the one with lower binding energy ($3d_{5/2}$). For example, a process like $3d_{3/2}^{-1} \\to 3d_{5/2}^{-1} + \\text{other excitations}$ might be possible. The opening of such a fast decay channel dramatically shortens the lifetime of the $3d_{3/2}$ hole state. This has two consequences: significant broadening of the $3d_{3/2}$ peak and, more importantly, a transfer of spectral intensity from the main photoemission line into broad satellite features or the inelastic background. As a result, the measured area of the main $3d_{3/2}$ peak is reduced relative to the $3d_{5/2}$ peak, causing the observed ratio $A(3d_{5/2})/A(3d_{3/2})$ to be greater than the statistical value.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{3}{2}}$$", "id": "2785119"}, {"introduction": "Beyond identifying surface elements and their chemical states, electron spectroscopy is a powerful tool for quantitative, non-destructive depth profiling.
