The physical parameters are realistic for such an experiment. The problem does not violate any of the criteria for invalidity.\n\nStep 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. I will provide a complete solution.\n\n**Part 1: Derivation of the Energy Release Rate, $G$**\n\nThe problem requires a derivation starting from first principles for a load-controlled, linear-elastic system.\n\nThe stored elastic energy, $U$, in a linear-elastic body is the work done on the body. For a linear spring-like system, the force is proportional to displacement, $P = k\\Delta$, where $k$ is the stiffness. The energy is the area under the force-displacement curve: $U = \\frac{1}{2}P\\Delta$.\nUsing the definition of compliance, $C(a) = \\frac{\\Delta(a)}{P}$, we can express the displacement as $\\Delta(a) = C(a)P$.\nSubstituting this into the energy expression gives the stored elastic energy as a function of compliance and force:\n$$ U = \\frac{1}{2}P(C(a)P) = \\frac{1}{2}C(a)P^2 $$\nThis expression confirms the given condition that $U$ scales quadratically with load.\n\nThe work done by the external applied force, $W_{\\mathrm{ext}}$, is the product of the constant force $P$ and the load-line displacement $\\Delta$.\n$$ W_{\\mathrm{ext}} = P\\Delta = P(C(a)P) = C(a)P^2 $$\n\nThe total potential energy of the system, $\\Pi$, is defined as the stored elastic energy minus the work done by the external forces.\n$$ \\Pi = U - W_{\\mathrm{ext}} = \\frac{1}{2}C(a)P^2 - C(a)P^2 = -\\frac{1}{2}C(a)P^2 $$\n\nThe energy release rate, $G$, represents the energy dissipated per unit area of crack extension. It is defined as the negative rate of change of the total potential energy with respect to the crack area, $A = a \\times b$. For a uniform width $b$, we have $dA = b \\cdot da$. Therefore, the definition given is correct:\n$$ G = -\\frac{1}{b}\\left(\\frac{\\partial \\Pi}{\\partial a}\\right)_{P} $$\nThe subscript $P$ denotes that the derivative is taken under constant load, which is the condition of this experiment.\n\nSubstituting the expression for $\\Pi$ into the definition of $G$:\n$$ G = -\\frac{1}{b}\\left(\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial a}\\left(-\\frac{1}{2}C(a)P^2\\right)\\right)_{P} $$\nSince the force $P$ is held constant during the crack advance, we can treat it as a constant in the differentiation.\n$$ G = -\\frac{1}{b}\\left(-\\frac{1}{2}P^2\\right)\\left(\\frac{dC(a)}{da}\\right) $$\nThis simplifies to the final expression for the energy release rate in a load-controlled test:\n$$ G = \\frac{P^2}{2b}\\frac{dC}{da} $$\nThis derivation is complete.\n\n**Part 2: Numerical Estimation of $G$**\n\nWe are given experimental data and must calculate $G$ at $a = 25.0\\ \\mathrm{mm}$. This requires estimating the derivative $\\frac{dC}{da}$ from discrete data points. All calculations will be performed in SI units to ensure consistency.\n\nThe given parameters are:\n- $P = 4.00\\ \\mathrm{N}$\n- $b = 15.0\\ \\mathrm{mm} = 0.0150\\ \\mathrm{m}$\n\nFirst, we compute the compliance, $C(a) = \\Delta(a)/P$, for each measured point.\n- Point 1: $a_1 = 20.0\\ \\mathrm{mm} = 0.0200\\ \\mathrm{m}$, $\\Delta_1 = 0.640\\ \\mathrm{mm} = 0.000640\\ \\mathrm{m}$\n  $$ C_1 = C(a_1) = \\frac{0.000640\\ \\mathrm{m}}{4.00\\ \\mathrm{N}} = 0.000160\\ \\mathrm{m/N} $$\n- Point 2: $a_2 = 25.0\\ \\mathrm{mm} = 0.0250\\ \\mathrm{m}$, $\\Delta_2 = 0.790\\ \\mathrm{mm} = 0.000790\\ \\mathrm{m}$\n  $$ C_2 = C(a_2) = \\frac{0.000790\\ \\mathrm{m}}{4.00\\ \\mathrm{N}} = 0.0001975\\ \\mathrm{m/N} $$\n- Point 3: $a_3 = 30.0\\ \\mathrm{mm} = 0.0300\\ \\mathrm{m}$, $\\Delta_3 = 0.940\\ \\mathrm{mm} = 0.000940\\ \\mathrm{m}$\n  $$ C_3 = C(a_3) = \\frac{0.000940\\ \\mathrm{m}}{4.00\\ \\mathrm{N}} = 0.000235\\ \\mathrm{m/N} $$\n\nTo estimate $\\frac{dC}{da}$ at $a_2 = 25.0\\ \\mathrm{mm}$, we use a centered finite difference scheme, which provides a second-order accurate approximation for the derivative at the midpoint of an interval. The formula is:\n$$ \\left.\\frac{dC}{da}\\right|_{a=a_2} \\approx \\frac{C(a_3) - C(a_1)}{a_3 - a_1} $$\nUsing the calculated values:\n$$ \\left.\\frac{dC}{da}\\right|_{a=0.0250\\ \\mathrm{m}} \\approx \\frac{0.000235\\ \\mathrm{m/N} - 0.000160\\ \\mathrm{m/N}}{0.0300\\ \\mathrm{m} - 0.0200\\ \\mathrm{m}} = \\frac{0.000075\\ \\mathrm{m/N}}{0.0100\\ \\mathrm{m}} = 0.0075\\ \\mathrm{N}^{-1} $$\n\nNow, we substitute this value into the derived expression for $G$:\n$$ G = \\frac{P^2}{2b}\\frac{dC}{da} $$\n$$ G = \\frac{(4.00\\ \\mathrm{N})^2}{2 \\times (0.0150\\ \\mathrm{m})} \\times (0.0075\\ \\mathrm{N}^{-1}) $$\n$$ G = \\frac{16.0\\ \\mathrm{N^2}}{0.0300\\ \\mathrm{m}} \\times 0.0075\\ \\mathrm{N}^{-1} $$\n$$ G = \\left(\\frac{16.0}{0.0300}\\right) \\mathrm{N/m} \\times 0.0075\\ \\mathrm{N}^{-1} $$\n$$ G = (533.33\\dots)\\ \\mathrm{N/m} \\times 0.0075\\ \\mathrm{N}^{-1} = 4.0\\ \\mathrm{N/m} $$\nThe unit $\\mathrm{N/m}$ is equivalent to $\\mathrm{J/m^2}$, as $1\\ \\mathrm{J} = 1\\ \\mathrm{N \\cdot m}$, so $1\\ \\mathrm{N/m} = 1\\ \\frac{\\mathrm{N \\cdot m}}{\\mathrm{m^2}} = 1\\ \\mathrm{J/m^2}$.\nThus, $G = 4.0\\ \\mathrm{J/m^2}$.\n\nThe problem requires the final answer to be rounded to three significant figures.\n$$ G = 4.00\\ \\mathrm{J/m^2} $$\nThis is the final computed value for the energy release rate.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{4.00}\n$$", "id": "2771444"}, {"introduction": "Moving beyond the linear geometry of a peel test, this exercise introduces the blister test, a common method for characterizing thin-film adhesion.

We shall proceed with the derivation.\n\nThe problem asks for two quantities: first, an expression for the work of adhesion, $\\Gamma$, and second, the propagated fractional uncertainty in this quantity, $\\sigma_{\\Gamma}/\\Gamma$.\n\nFirst, we derive the expression for $\\Gamma$. The governing principle is the energy balance for crack propagation. At equilibrium, the energy release rate, $\\mathcal{G}$, associated with an infinitesimal increase in the delaminated area must be equal to the work of adhesion, $\\Gamma$, which is the energy required to create a new unit area of debonded interface. The energy release rate is defined as the negative rate of change of the system's mechanical energy, $U_M$, with respect to the delaminated area, $A$. The mechanical energy is the sum of the stored elastic strain energy, $U_S$, and the potential of the external load, which is the negative of the work done by the pressure, $-W_p$.\nThus, $U_M = U_S - W_p$. For a circular delamination of radius $a$, the area is $A = \\pi a^2$, so $dA = 2\\pi a \\, da$. The energy release rate is:\n$$ \\mathcal{G} = - \\frac{\\partial U_M}{\\partial A} = -\\frac{1}{2\\pi a} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial a}(U_S - W_p) $$\nAt equilibrium, we have $\\Gamma = \\mathcal{G}$.\n\nTo find $U_S$ and $W_p$, we must determine the deflection profile, $w(r)$, of the circular blister. The problem states that the system is in the bending-dominated regime, governed by Kirchhoff–Love plate theory. For an isotropic circular plate of radius $a$ under a uniform pressure $p$, with clamped boundary conditions, the governing equation for the axi-symmetric deflection $w(r)$ is:\n$$ D \\nabla^4 w = p $$\nwhere $D = \\frac{Eh^3}{12(1-\\nu^2)}$ is the flexural rigidity of the plate. In polar coordinates, this equation becomes:\n$$ \\frac{1}{r} \\frac{d}{dr} \\left( r \\frac{d}{dr} \\left( \\frac{1}{r} \\frac{d}{dr} \\left( r \\frac{dw}{dr} \\right) \\right) \\right) = \\frac{p}{D} $$\nThe general solution is $w(r) = C_1 + C_2 r^2 + C_3 \\ln(r) + C_4 r^2 \\ln(r) + \\frac{pr^4}{64D}$.\nThe boundary conditions are:\n$1$. Finiteness of deflection at the center ($r=0$) requires $C_3=0$ and $C_4=0$.\n$2$. Clamped condition at the edge ($r=a$): $w(a)=0$ and $\\frac{dw}{dr}|_{r=a}=0$.\n\nFrom $\\frac{dw}{dr} = 2C_2 r + \\frac{4pr^3}{64D} = 2C_2 r + \\frac{pr^3}{16D}$, the condition $\\frac{dw}{dr}|_{r=a}=0$ gives $2C_2 a + \\frac{pa^3}{16D} = 0$, which yields $C_2 = -\\frac{pa^2}{32D}$.\nFrom $w(a)=0$, we have $C_1 + C_2 a^2 + \\frac{pa^4}{64D} = 0$. Substituting $C_2$, we find $C_1 - \\frac{pa^4}{32D} + \\frac{pa^4}{64D} = 0$, which gives $C_1 = \\frac{pa^4}{64D}$.\nThe deflection profile is therefore:\n$$ w(r) = \\frac{pa^4}{64D} - \\frac{pa^2 r^2}{32D} + \\frac{pr^4}{64D} = \\frac{p}{64D}(a^2-r^2)^2 $$\nWith the deflection profile known, we can calculate the work done by the pressure, $W_p$:\n$$ W_p = \\int_0^a p \\cdot w(r) \\cdot 2\\pi r \\, dr = 2\\pi p \\int_0^a \\frac{p}{64D}(a^2-r^2)^2 r \\, dr $$\n$$ W_p = \\frac{\\pi p^2}{32D} \\int_0^a (a^4 r - 2a^2 r^3 + r^5) dr = \\frac{\\pi p^2}{32D} \\left[ \\frac{a^4 r^2}{2} - \\frac{a^6}{2} + \\frac{a^6}{6} \\right]_0^a = \\frac{\\pi p^2 a^6}{192D} $$\nFor a linear elastic system like a plate in the small-deflection regime, the stored strain energy is one-half of the work done by the external loads: $U_S = \\frac{1}{2}W_p$.\n$$ U_S = \\frac{\\pi p^2 a^6}{384D} $$\nThe mechanical energy is $U_M = U_S - W_p = \\frac{1}{2}W_p - W_p = -\\frac{1}{2}W_p = -\\frac{\\pi p^2 a^6}{384D}$.\nNow we calculate the energy release rate:\n$$ \\mathcal{G} = -\\frac{1}{2\\pi a} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial a} \\left( -\\frac{\\pi p^2 a^6}{384D} \\right) = \\frac{\\pi p^2}{2\\pi a \\cdot 384D} \\frac{d(a^6)}{da} = \\frac{p^2}{768D a} (6a^5) = \\frac{p^2 a^4}{128D} $$\nSetting $\\Gamma = \\mathcal{G}$ and substituting the expression for $D$:\n$$ \\Gamma = \\frac{p^2 a^4}{128} \\left( \\frac{12(1-\\nu^2)}{Eh^3} \\right) = \\frac{3(1-\\nu^2)}{32} \\frac{p^2 a^4}{Eh^3} $$\nThis is the required expression for the work of adhesion.\n\nNext, we derive the formula for the fractional uncertainty, $\\sigma_{\\Gamma}/\\Gamma$.
