We shall first validate the fundamental premises of the problem, then proceed to a rigorous evaluation of each proposed statement.\n\nThe material behavior is governed by a cohesionless Drucker-Prager yield criterion. The yield function, $f$, defines the boundary of the elastic domain in stress space. For a cohesionless material, this function takes the form of a cone with its apex at the origin of the stress space. It is expressed in terms of stress invariants as:\n$$f(\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}) = \\sqrt{J_2} + \\alpha p$$\nwhere $p = \\frac{1}{3} \\operatorname{tr}(\\boldsymbol{\\sigma})$ is the mean stress, $J_2 = \\frac{1}{2} \\boldsymbol{s}:\\boldsymbol{s}$ is the second invariant of the deviatoric stress tensor $\\boldsymbol{s} = \\boldsymbol{\\sigma} - p \\boldsymbol{I}$, and $\\alpha  0$ is a material parameter related to the internal friction angle. The elastic domain is defined by the condition $f(\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}) \\le 0$. The case under consideration is the limit $p \\to 0$, which implies $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma} \\to \\boldsymbol{0}$, corresponding to the apex of the yield cone.\n\nThe problem centers on the associative flow rule, where the increment of plastic strain, $\\Delta\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}^p$, is given by:\n$$\\Delta\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}^p = \\Delta\\gamma \\, \\boldsymbol{r}$$\nHere, $\\Delta\\gamma \\ge 0$ is the plastic multiplier and $\\boldsymbol{r}$ is the plastic flow direction, which for an associative model is normal to the yield surface: $\\boldsymbol{r} = \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial \\boldsymbol{\\sigma}}$.\n\nWe compute the gradient of the yield function for a stress state where the function is differentiable (i.e., for $J_2  0$):\n$$ \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial \\boldsymbol{\\sigma}} = \\frac{\\partial \\sqrt{J_2}}{\\partial \\boldsymbol{\\sigma}} + \\alpha \\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial \\boldsymbol{\\sigma}} $$\nThe derivatives of the invariants are standard: $\\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial \\boldsymbol{\\sigma}} = \\frac{1}{3}\\boldsymbol{I}$ and $\\frac{\\partial J_2}{\\partial \\boldsymbol{\\sigma}} = \\boldsymbol{s}$. Using the chain rule for $\\sqrt{J_2}$:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial \\sqrt{J_2}}{\\partial \\boldsymbol{\\sigma}} = \\frac{1}{2\\sqrt{J_2}} \\frac{\\partial J_2}{\\partial \\boldsymbol{\\sigma}} = \\frac{\\boldsymbol{s}}{2\\sqrt{J_2}} $$\nThis expression is well-defined only if $J_2 \\neq 0$, which means $\\boldsymbol{s} \\neq \\boldsymbol{0}$. At the apex of the cone, $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma} = \\boldsymbol{0}$, which implies $p=0$ and $\\boldsymbol{s}=\\boldsymbol{0}$, so $J_2=0$. At this point, the function $f$ is not differentiable because the map $\\boldsymbol{s} \\mapsto \\sqrt{J_2}$ is not differentiable at $\\boldsymbol{s}=\\boldsymbol{0}$. This is the apex singularity.\n\nIn the framework of convex analysis, for a non-differentiable convex function, the gradient is replaced by the subdifferential, denoted $\\partial f$. The subdifferential $\\partial f(\\boldsymbol{\\sigma})$ is the set of all tensors $\\boldsymbol{g}$ satisfying the inequality $f(\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}^*) \\ge f(\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}) + \\boldsymbol{g} : (\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}^* - \\boldsymbol{\\sigma})$ for all $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}^*$. At the apex $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}=\\boldsymbol{0}$, the subdifferential of $f$ is the sum of the subdifferentials of its components:\n$$\\partial f(\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}=\\boldsymbol{0}) = \\partial(\\sqrt{J_2})|_{\\boldsymbol{s}=\\boldsymbol{0}} + \\partial(\\alpha p)|_{p=0}$$\nThe term $\\alpha p$ is linear and thus its derivative is constant: $\\nabla(\\alpha p) = \\frac{\\alpha}{3}\\boldsymbol{I}$. The subdifferential of $\\boldsymbol{s} \\mapsto \\sqrt{J_2} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\|\\boldsymbol{s}\\|$ at $\\boldsymbol{s}=\\boldsymbol{0}$ is the set of all deviatoric tensors $\\boldsymbol{\\xi}$ such that their Frobenius norm satisfies $\\|\\boldsymbol{\\xi}\\| \\le \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}$.\nThus, the subdifferential at the apex is the set:\n$$ \\partial f(\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}=\\boldsymbol{0}) = \\left\\{ \\boldsymbol{g} = \\frac{\\alpha}{3}\\boldsymbol{I} + \\boldsymbol{\\xi} \\; \\bigg| \\; \\operatorname{tr}(\\boldsymbol{\\xi}) = 0, \\; \\|\\boldsymbol{\\xi}\\| \\le \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\right\\} $$\nThis set contains an infinite number of possible tensors. Consequently, the plastic flow direction $\\boldsymbol{r} \\in \\partial f(\\boldsymbol{0})$ is not unique. This non-uniqueness poses a severe problem for implicit return-mapping algorithms, which typically rely on a Newton-Raphson scheme to solve the nonlinear system of equations for the stress update. The lack of a unique gradient prevents the formulation of a well-defined consistent tangent operator, leading to the failure of the algorithm to converge quadratically, or at all.\n\nWith this foundation, we evaluate each of the options.\n\n**Option A**: This statement correctly identifies that the yield function is not differentiable at the apex due to the non-differentiability of the map $\\boldsymbol{s} \\mapsto \\sqrt{J_2}$ at $\\boldsymbol{s}=\\boldsymbol{0}$. It correctly states that the gradient is set-valued and provides the correct mathematical expression for the subdifferential, $\\partial f(\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}=\\boldsymbol{0})$. It accurately concludes that this leads to a non-unique plastic flow direction. The proposed regularization, replacing $\\sqrt{J_2}$ with a \"hyperbolic\" smoothing $\\sqrt{J_2 + \\varepsilon^2}$ for some small parameter $\\varepsilon0$, is a standard and robust technique. The smoothed yield function $f_\\varepsilon(\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}) = \\sqrt{J_2 + \\varepsilon^2} + \\alpha p$ is indeed $C^\\infty$ (infinitely differentiable), as the argument of the square root is now strictly positive. The convexity of the yield surface is preserved. A smooth function has a unique gradient everywhere, which resolves the ambiguity in the flow direction. This allows for the derivation of a consistent algorithmic tangent, which is essential to restore the quadratic convergence rate of the Newton method used in the implicit FEM solver. All claims in this option are correct.\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\n**Option B**: This statement claims the yield function is differentiable at the apex and that its normal is purely hydrostatic. This is fundamentally incorrect. As established, the function is not differentiable at the apex. The subdifferential contains an infinite number of directions, most of which are not purely hydrostatic (i.e., they have a non-zero deviatoric part $\\boldsymbol{\\xi}$). The claim that there is no singularity is false, and therefore the conclusion that a standard return mapping works without modification is also false.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**Option C**: This statement begins with the claim that the apex subdifferential contains hydrostatic directions only. This is false. As shown in our derivation of $\\partial f(\\boldsymbol{0})$, the subdifferential is a set of tensors of the form $\\frac{\\alpha}{3}\\boldsymbol{I} + \\boldsymbol{\\xi}$, where $\\boldsymbol{\\xi}$ can be any deviatoric tensor within a certain norm bound. Only the specific case $\\boldsymbol{\\xi}=\\boldsymbol{0}$ corresponds to a purely hydrostatic direction. Because the initial premise is factually wrong, the entire proposition is flawed. While switching to a smooth non-associated potential $g(\\boldsymbol{\\sigma})$ *is* a strategy to regularize the flow direction, it does not correct the initial erroneous statement and introduces its own set of complexities, such as a non-symmetric tangent operator.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**Option D**: This option proposes a regularization by introducing a small cohesion, $k_\\varepsilon  0$. The yield function becomes $f_\\varepsilon(\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}) = \\sqrt{J_2} + \\alpha p - k_\\varepsilon$. The apex of this new yield surface is located where $\\sqrt{J_2}=0$ (i.e., $\\boldsymbol{s}=\\boldsymbol{0}$) and $\\alpha p - k_\\varepsilon = 0$, which gives $p = k_\\varepsilon / \\alpha$. Since $\\alpha0$ and $k_\\varepsilon0$, the apex is moved to a point on the positive (tensile) mean stress axis. For a material point where the stress state approaches zero ($p \\to 0$), it is now situated in a region far from the new apex. Any plastic return in this region will be to a smooth part of the cone, thus avoiding the singularity. This procedure does preserve the convexity of the yield surface. It stabilizes the return mapping algorithm by design. The drawback is correctly identified: it introduces an artificial cohesion $k_\\varepsilon$, creating a bias in the material's predicted shear strength at zero confinement. This is a well-known and valid regularization method.\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\n**Option E**: This option describes the strategy of replacing the singular conical vertex with a smooth \"cap\". This is often achieved by blending the conical Drucker-Prager surface with a smooth, convex surface, such as an ellipse (as in the Modified Cam-Clay model) or a hyperbola, in the low-pressure regime. This modification, if done with a $C^1$-continuous (or higher) transition, globally removes the vertex singularity. The resulting composite yield surface is smooth everywhere. A smooth and convex yield surface guarantees a unique normal vector at every point, which in turn defines a unique plastic flow direction for an associative model. This enables the straightforward derivation of a consistent tangent operator, ensuring robust convergence of implicit integration schemes. This is a sophisticated and highly effective regularization strategy.\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\n**Option F**: This statement suggests that the singularity can be eliminated by changing the metric used for the closest-point projection in the return mapping. The return-mapping algorithm finds a stress state $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}_{n+1}$ on the yield surface that minimizes a distance to the trial stress $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}_{\\mathrm{tr}}$. The standard metric is based on the elastic energy, defined by the elastic stiffness tensor $\\mathbf{C}^e$. Changing this metric will change the path of return and the final point $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}_{n+1}$. However, the singularity is an intrinsic property of the *yield function* $f$ and the associated *flow rule*. The non-uniqueness of the flow direction stems from the non-uniqueness of the normal to the yield surface at the apex. This is a feature of the constitutive model itself. Modifying the numerical algorithm's distance measure does not alter the geometry of the yield surface or the set of admissible flow directions (the subdifferential) at the apex. If the projection—regardless of the metric—identifies the apex as the solution, the problem of a non-unique flow direction remains. The statement that this change `eliminates the singularity at the apex without any modification of the yield surface or flow rule` is a contradiction in terms.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{ADE}$$", "id": "2612475"}]}
