Strain-Displacement Matrix $B$**\nThe strain field $\\epsilon$ is related to the nodal displacement vector $d$ by $\\epsilon = B d$. The components of the strain field are:\n$\\epsilon_{xx} = \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x} = \\sum_{i=1}^{3} \\frac{\\partial N_{i}}{\\partial x} u_{i} = \\frac{\\partial N_{1}}{\\partial x}u_{1} + \\frac{\\partial N_{2}}{\\partial x}u_{2} + \\frac{\\partial N_{3}}{\\partial x}u_{3} = -\\frac{1}{L}u_{1} + \\frac{1}{L}u_{2}$.\n$\\epsilon_{yy} = \\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial y} = \\sum_{i=1}^{3} \\frac{\\partial N_{i}}{\\partial y} v_{i} = \\frac{\\partial N_{1}}{\\partial y}v_{1} + \\frac{\\partial N_{2}}{\\partial y}v_{2} + \\frac{\\partial N_{3}}{\\partial y}v_{3} = -\\frac{1}{H}v_{1} + \\frac{1}{H}v_{3}$.\n$\\gamma_{xy} = \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial y} + \\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial x} = \\left(\\sum_{i=1}^{3} \\frac{\\partial N_{i}}{\\partial y} u_{i}\\right) + \\left(\\sum_{i=1}^{3} \\frac{\\partial N_{i}}{\\partial x} v_{i}\\right) = \\left(-\\frac{1}{H}u_{1} + \\frac{1}{H}u_{3}\\right) + \\left(-\\frac{1}{L}v_{1} + \\frac{1}{L}v_{2}\\right)$.\n\nThe matrix $B$ is constructed by placing the coefficients of the nodal displacements $(u_i, v_i)$ in the appropriate columns.\n$$\n\\begin{pmatrix} \\epsilon_{xx} \\\\ \\epsilon_{yy} \\\\ \\gamma_{xy} \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{\\partial N_1}{\\partial x} & 0 & \\frac{\\partial N_2}{\\partial x} & 0 & \\frac{\\partial N_3}{\\partial x} & 0 \\\\ 0 & \\frac{\\partial N_1}{\\partial y} & 0 & \\frac{\\partial N_2}{\\partial y} & 0 & \\frac{\\partial N_3}{\\partial y} \\\\ \\frac{\\partial N_1}{\\partial y} & \\frac{\\partial N_1}{\\partial x} & \\frac{\\partial N_2}{\\partial y} & \\frac{\\partial N_2}{\\partial x} & \\frac{\\partial N_3}{\\partial y} & \\frac{\\partial N_3}{\\partial x} \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} u_1 \\\\ v_1 \\\\ u_2 \\\\ v_2 \\\\ u_3 \\\\ v_3 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\n\nSubstituting the constant derivatives gives the strain-displacement matrix $B$:\n$$B = \\begin{pmatrix} -\\frac{1}{L} & 0 & \\frac{1}{L} & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -\\frac{1}{H} & 0 & 0 & 0 & \\frac{1}{H} \\\\ -\\frac{1}{H} & -\\frac{1}{L} & 0 & \\frac{1}{L} & \\frac{1}{H} & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$$\n\n**3. Volumetric Strain Field $\\epsilon_{v}(x,y)$**\nThe volumetric strain is $\\epsilon_{v} = \\epsilon_{xx} + \\epsilon_{yy}$. From the expressions derived above:\n$\\epsilon_{v}(x,y) = \\left(-\\frac{1}{L}u_{1} + \\frac{1}{L}u_{2}\\right) + \\left(-\\frac{1}{H}v_{1} + \\frac{1}{H}v_{3}\\right)$.\nThis can be written as:\n$\\epsilon_{v} = \\frac{1}{L}(u_{2} - u_{1}) + \\frac{1}{H}(v_{3} - v_{1})$.\nSince the nodal displacements $(u_{i}, v_{i})$ and the element dimensions $L$ and $H$ are constants for a given analysis step, the quantities $\\epsilon_{xx}$, $\\epsilon_{yy}$, and consequently $\\epsilon_{v}$, are constant throughout the element domain $\\Omega_{e}$. This is the defining characteristic of the Constant Strain Triangle (CST) element.\n\n**4. Projected Volumetric Strain $\\bar{\\epsilon}_{v}$ and Discussion**\nThe B-bar method computes the element-averaged volumetric strain $\\bar{\\epsilon}_{v}$ by the formula:\n$\\bar{\\epsilon}_{v} = \\frac{1}{A} \\int_{\\Omega_{e}} \\epsilon_{v}(x,y) \\, \\mathrm{d}A$.\nThe area of the right triangular element is $A = \\frac{1}{2}LH$.\nAs established, $\\epsilon_{v}$ is constant over the domain $\\Omega_{e}$. Therefore, it can be factored out of the integral:\n$\\bar{\\epsilon}_{v} = \\frac{1}{A} \\epsilon_{v} \\int_{\\Omega_{e}} \\, \\mathrm{d}A = \\frac{1}{A} \\epsilon_{v} A = \\epsilon_{v}$.\nThe projected volumetric strain is identical to the original volumetric strain field:\n$\\bar{\\epsilon}_{v} = \\frac{1}{L}(u_{2} - u_{1}) + \\frac{1}{H}(v_{3} - v_{1})$.\n\n**Justification and Discussion**:\nFor the linear triangular (T3) element, the B-bar modification does not alter the volumetric strain, i.e., $\\bar{\\epsilon}_{v} = \\epsilon_{v}$. This is because the standard formulation of the T3 element already produces a constant volumetric strain field, and the average of a constant field is the constant itself. The operation is a trivial identity.\n\nThe implication for volumetric locking is significant. Volumetric locking is a numerical artifact in FEM where an element becomes overly stiff when analyzing nearly-incompressible materials (Poisson's ratio $\\nu \\to 0.5$). This occurs because the element's kinematic description (the shape functions) cannot adequately represent the zero-volume-change (isochoric) deformation modes required by the material law. The T3 element, with its constant strain field, is particularly poor in this regard. Because the B-bar method does not change the volumetric strain operator for the T3 element ($\\bar{B}=B$), it offers no improvement and is completely ineffective at mitigating volumetric locking for this element type. To alleviate locking, one must use higher-order elements (e.g., quadratic elements with reduced integration) or mixed formulations, where the B-bar method or equivalent techniques genuinely modify the strain field to relax the incompressibility constraint.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{u_{2}-u_{1}}{L} + \\frac{v_{3}-v_{1}}{H}}$$", "id": "2542571"}, {"introduction": "Having established why the B-bar method is not needed for a T3 element, we now turn to the four-node bilinear quadrilateral (Q4), a workhorse element that is susceptible to volumetric locking.

It presents a standard exercise in the field of computational solid mechanics, specifically the finite element method. No inconsistencies or fallacies are detected. The problem is valid, and I will proceed with its solution.\n\nThe analysis concerns a $2$D, four-node isoparametric quadrilateral element under plane strain conditions. The element geometry is a square of side length $L$, mapped from a canonical parent element in the $(\\xi, \\eta)$ coordinate system where $\\xi, \\eta \\in [-1, 1]$.
