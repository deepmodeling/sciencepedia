Your final reported answer must be the closed-form expression for the dimension of the constrained interpolation space as a function of $N$ (no units are required, and no rounding is needed).", "solution": "The problem statement is scrutinized and found to be valid. It is a well-posed problem grounded in the standard theory of the finite element method, specifically concerning $C^1$-continuous Hermite elements and the strong imposition of boundary conditions. All definitions and conditions are self-contained and scientifically sound. We shall proceed with the derivation.\n\nThe finite element discretization is defined on a uniform partition of the interval $[0, L]$ into $N$ subintervals. This partition involves $N+1$ nodes, indexed from $i=0$ to $i=N$, where $x_0 = 0$ and $x_N = L$. For the one-dimensional cubic Hermite element, the degrees of freedom (DoFs) at each node $x_i$ are the function value $u(x_i)$ and its first derivative $u'(x_i)$. Therefore, there are $2$ DoFs per node. The total number of global DoFs for the unconstrained problem is the number of nodes multiplied by the number of DoFs per node, which is $2(N+1)$. The vector of global DoFs, $\\mathbf{d}$, is an element of $\\mathbb{R}^{2(N+1)}$ and is ordered as $\\mathbf{d} = (u(x_0), u'(x_0), u(x_1), u'(x_1), \\dots, u(x_N), u'(x_N))^{\\top}$.\n\n1.  Identification of Constrained Degrees of Freedom:\nThe clamped boundary conditions are given as $u(0)=0$, $u'(0)=0$ and $u(L)=0$, $u'(L)=0$. The strong (or essential) enforcement of these boundary conditions involves directly setting the corresponding global DoF values to zero. The boundary nodes are $x_0=0$ and $x_N=L$.\nAt the left boundary, $x=0$, the conditions $u(0)=0$ and $u'(0)=0$ directly constrain the two DoFs associated with node $x_0$. These DoFs are precisely $u(x_0)$ and $u'(x_0)$.\nAt the right boundary, $x=L$, the conditions $u(L)=0$ and $u'(L)=0$ directly constrain the two DoFs associated with node $x_N$. These DoFs are $u(x_N)$ and $u'(x_N)$.\nIn total, there are $4$ specific DoFs that must be constrained to zero: $u(x_0)$, $u'(x_0)$, $u(x_N)$, and $u'(x_N)$.\n\n2.  Constraint System and Rank of the Constraint Matrix:\nThe vector of global DoFs has $2(N+1)$ components. Let us denote the components of $\\mathbf{d}$ by $d_j$ for $j=0, 1, \\dots, 2N+1$. Following the specified ordering, we have:\n$d_0 = u(x_0)$\n$d_1 = u'(x_0)$\n...\n$d_{2i} = u(x_i)$\n$d_{2i+1} = u'(x_i)$\n...\n$d_{2N} = u(x_N)$\n$d_{2N+1} = u'(x_N)$\n\nThe four boundary conditions translate into four linear homogeneous equations:\n$d_0 = 0$\n$d_1 = 0$\n$d_{2N} = 0$\n$d_{2N+1} = 0$\n\nThis system of equations can be written in matrix form as $C\\mathbf{d} = \\mathbf{0}$, where $C$ is the constraint matrix. The matrix $C$ has $4$ rows, one for each constraint, and $2(N+1)$ columns, corresponding to the total number of DoFs. The rows of $C$ are constructed as follows:\nRow $1$ corresponds to $d_0 = 0$: $[1, 0, 0, \\dots, 0]$\nRow $2$ corresponds to $d_1 = 0$: $[0, 1, 0, \\dots, 0]$\nRow $3$ corresponds to $d_{2N} = 0$: $[0, \\dots, 0, 1, 0]$ (with a $1$ in the $(2N+1)$-th position, corresponding to index $2N$)\nRow $4$ corresponds to $d_{2N+1} = 0$: $[0, \\dots, 0, 0, 1]$ (with a $1$ in the $(2N+2)$-th position, corresponding to index $2N+1$)\n\nTo determine the rank of $C$, $\\operatorname{rank}(C)$, from first principles, we examine the linear independence of its row vectors. The rank of a matrix is the dimension of the vector space spanned by its rows. The four row vectors of $C$ are vectors from the standard basis of $\\mathbb{R}^{2(N+1)}$. Specifically, they correspond to the vectors representing the constraints on the $1$-st, $2$-nd, $(2N+1)$-th, and $(2N+2)$-th components of $\\mathbf{d}$. These vectors are orthogonal to each other and, by their fundamental definition, are linearly independent. A set of standard basis vectors is always linearly independent. Since there are $4$ distinct such vectors forming the rows of $C$, they form a linearly independent set. Therefore, the rank of the constraint matrix $C$ is exactly $4$.\n$\\operatorname{rank}(C) = 4$.\n\nThe enforcement of these boundary conditions has a tangible effect on the basis of the finite element space. The unconstrained approximation $u_h(x)$ is a linear combination of the global basis functions $\\phi_j(x)$, $u_h(x) = \\sum_{j=0}^{2N+1} d_j \\phi_j(x)$. Each basis function $\\phi_j$ is uniquely associated with a single DoF $d_j$, such that it corresponds to a unit value for that DoF and zero for all other DoFs. Constraining $d_0, d_1, d_{2N}, d_{2N+1}$ to zero is equivalent to removing the corresponding basis functions $\\phi_0, \\phi_1, \\phi_{2N}, \\phi_{2N+1}$ from the basis. These are precisely the four basis functions associated with the value and derivative DoFs at the boundary nodes $x_0$ and $x_N$. This removal ensures that any function in the resulting constrained space has zero value and zero derivative at the boundaries, as all remaining basis functions have these properties at $x_0$ and $x_N$.\n\n3.  Dimension of the Constrained Interpolation Space:\nThe constrained interpolation space is the set of all vectors $\\mathbf{d} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{2(N+1)}$ that satisfy the system of linear equations $C\\mathbf{d} = \\mathbf{0}$. This space is precisely the null space (or kernel) of the matrix $C$. The dimension of this null space is called the nullity of $C$.\n\nAccording to the rank-nullity theorem from linear algebra, for any linear map represented by a matrix $C$ from a vector space $V$ to a vector space $W$, the following relation holds:\n$\\operatorname{rank}(C) + \\operatorname{nullity}(C) = \\dim(V)$\n\nIn our context, the domain $V$ is the space of all possible global DoF vectors, $V = \\mathbb{R}^{2(N+1)}$. Thus, its dimension is $\\dim(V) = 2(N+1)$. The dimension of the constrained interpolation space is $\\operatorname{nullity}(C)$.\nWe have already established that $\\operatorname{rank}(C) = 4$.\nSubstituting these values into the rank-nullity theorem:\n$4 + \\operatorname{dim}(\\text{constrained space}) = 2(N+1)$\n$\\operatorname{dim}(\\text{constrained space}) = 2(N+1) - 4$\n$\\operatorname{dim}(\\text{constrained space}) = 2N + 2 - 4$\n$\\operatorname{dim}(\\text{constrained space}) = 2N - 2$\n\nThis result is consistent with the basis function perspective: the original $2(N+1)$ basis functions are reduced by the $4$ boundary basis functions, leaving $2(N+1) - 4 = 2N-2$ basis functions to span the constrained space. This represents the number of free, or unconstrained, degrees of freedom in the system.\nThe expression can also be written as $2(N-1)$, which corresponds to the degrees of freedom at the $N-1$ interior nodes ($x_1, \\dots, x_{N-1}$), each having $2$ DoFs.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{2N - 2}\n$$", "id": "2548386"}, {"introduction": "Building on the mechanics of constraining degrees of freedom, we now apply these concepts to a classical engineering problem: the Euler-Bernoulli beam.

In a finite element method, boundary conditions are classified as either essential or natural.\n- **Essential boundary conditions** are imposed on the primary field variables of the trial space. For a $C^1$ formulation, the nodal degrees of freedom are the deflection $w$ and its first derivative, the rotation $w'$. Therefore, any condition specified on $w$ or $w'$ is an essential condition and must be enforced by directly constraining the corresponding nodal DOFs.\n- **Natural boundary conditions** are those involving derivatives that appear in the boundary integral terms of the weak form. Here, conditions on the shear force $V = -E I w'''$ (conjugate to $v$) and the bending moment $M = -E I w''$ (conjugate to $v'$) are natural. These conditions are automatically satisfied by the solution of the weak form if the corresponding essential condition is not imposed.\n\n**Part 1: Analysis of Boundary Conditions**\n\n1.  **Clamped end:** Physics dictates that both deflection and rotation are zero.\n    - $w=0$ (condition on deflection)\n    - $w'=0$ (condition on rotation)\n    - Both are **essential** conditions. At a node $i$, this requires constraining both DOFs: $w_i=0$ and $\\theta_i=0$.\n\n2.  **Simply supported (pinned) end:** Physics dictates zero deflection and zero bending moment, as the end is free to rotate.\n    - $w=0$ (condition on deflection)\n    - $M = -E I w'' = 0$ (condition on moment)\n    - The condition $w=0$ is **essential**. The condition $M=0$ is **natural**. At a node $i$, this requires constraining only the deflection DOF, $w_i=0$. The rotation DOF $\\theta_i$ remains free.\n\n3.  **Free end:** There are no physical restraints, meaning both the internal shear force and bending moment must be zero.\n    - $V = -E I w''' = 0$ (condition on shear)\n    - $M = -E I w'' = 0$ (condition on moment)\n    - Both are **natural** conditions. No essential conditions are imposed.

Irons, is a necessary condition for the convergence of a finite element formulation. It states that an assembly of elements (a \"patch\") must be able to reproduce a state of constant strain exactly when an appropriate displacement field is prescribed on the boundary of the patch.\n\nFor the Kirchhoff–Love plate theory, the \"strains\" are the components of the curvature tensor, $\\boldsymbol{\\kappa}$. A state of constant strain is therefore a state of constant curvature. The components of curvature are the second partial derivatives of the transverse deflection $w(x,y)$:\n$$ \\kappa_{xx} = \\frac{\\partial^2 w}{\\partial x^2} \\quad , \\quad \\kappa_{yy} = \\frac{\\partial^2 w}{\\partial y^2} \\quad , \\quad \\kappa_{xy} = \\frac{\\partial^2 w}{\\partial x \\partial y} $$\n\nFor these curvatures to be constant, say $\\kappa_{xx} = C_1$, $\\kappa_{yy} = C_2$, and $\\kappa_{xy} = C_3$, the deflection field $w(x,y)$ must be a complete quadratic polynomial of the form:\n$$ w(x,y) = a_0 + a_1 x + a_2 y + a_3 x^2 + a_4 xy + a_5 y^2 $$\nThe terms $\\{1, x, y\\}$ represent the rigid-body modes (constant translation and rotations), which must produce zero strain and hence must be represented exactly. The quadratic terms $\\{x^2, xy, y^2\\}$ represent the states of constant curvature. Therefore, a plate element must be able to exactly reproduce any polynomial in the set $\\text{span}\\{1, x, y, x^2, xy, y^2\\}$. This is the classical or minimal patch test requirement, based on Strang's second condition for convergence, which requires that for an elliptic problem whose energy functional contains derivatives up to order $m$, the shape functions must be able to reproduce all polynomials of degree up to $m$. For Kirchhoff-Love plates, the strain energy involves second derivatives, so $m=2$.\n\nThe requirement for this test to pass is linked to the $C^1$ continuity. The variational form involves integrals of products of second derivatives. When integrated by parts over each element, boundary terms appear on the element edges. These terms involve both $w$ and its normal derivative $\\partial w/\\partial n$. For a non-conforming element where $\\partial w/\\partial n$ is discontinuous across an interelement edge, the jump can create spurious line moments that do not cancel between adjacent elements. The patch test is passed if the element formulation is such that for a polynomial field of degree $m=2$, the work done by these spurious terms integrates to zero, ensuring equilibrium is satisfied. A conforming $C^1$ element passes this test by construction; for such elements, the patch test serves as a check for correct implementation.\n\nAn alternative, stronger formulation of the patch test demands exact reproduction of any polynomial solution to the *homogeneous* governing differential equation. Here, the equation is $D \\nabla^4 w = q$. With zero load, $q=0$, the homogeneous equation is the biharmonic equation $\\nabla^4 w = 0$. Any polynomial $\\tilde{w}(x,y)$ of total degree less than or equal to $3$ is a solution to this equation, since all its fourth derivatives are identically zero. Therefore, a valid, albeit more stringent, patch test is to require the exact reproduction of any cubic polynomial.\n\n**Evaluation of Options**\n\n**A. Assemble a patch and enforce boundary data matching any $\\tilde{w}$ in the span of $\\{1, x, y, x^2, xy, y^2\\}$ with $q=0$. The element must reproduce these fields exactly throughout the patch and return zero interior nodal forces. This verifies that constant-curvature states (quadratics) and rigid-body modes (constant/linear) are represented without generating interelement line moments, which would otherwise appear if first derivatives were discontinuous; thus, passing indicates correct $C^1$ continuity.**\nThis option correctly identifies the polynomial set for the minimal, or classical, patch test based on the constant strain criterion ($m=2$). The set $\\{1, x, y, x^2, xy, y^2\\}$ corresponds to rigid-body modes and constant-curvature states. The rationale provided is also entirely correct: the test verifies that these fundamental states are represented without spurious artifacts (line moments) that arise from a failure to properly enforce the $C^1$ continuity condition in the weak form.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. Assemble a patch and enforce boundary data matching any $\\tilde{w}$ in the span of $\\{1, x, y\\}$ with $q=0$. If these are reproduced exactly, then $C^1$ continuity is verified because linear fields have constant slopes.**\nThis is insufficient. The set $\\{1, x, y\\}$ only represents rigid-body motions. While any valid element must reproduce these, this test does not check the element's ability to represent the lowest-order bending states (constant curvature). A simple $C^0$ continuous element, unsuitable for Kirchhoff-Love theory, could pass this test. It fails to test the crucial aspect of the formulation related to bending.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. Assemble a patch and enforce boundary data matching any $\\tilde{w}$ in the span of all polynomials of total degree $\\le 4$ with $q=0$. Exact reproduction under zero load is required because the governing equation is fourth order, so quartic fields are the minimal set to test.**\nThis is incorrect on multiple grounds. First, the minimal set is determined by the order of derivatives in the energy functional ($m=2$), not the order of the PDE. Second, a general polynomial $\\tilde{w}$ of degree $4$ does not satisfy the homogeneous equation $\\nabla^4 \\tilde{w} = 0$. In fact, $\\nabla^4 \\tilde{w}$ is a non-zero constant. Thus, with $q=0$, a quartic field is not an exact solution, and the finite element method should *not* reproduce it. The reasoning is flawed.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. Assemble a patch and enforce boundary data matching any $\\tilde{w}$ in the span of all monomials of total degree $\\le 3$ with $q=0$. Exact reproduction of these fields and zero interior nodal forces are required. Because any polynomial of degree $\\le 3$ satisfies $D \\nabla^4 \\tilde{w} = 0$, these are self-equilibrated states; reproducing them without spurious line forces requires interelement continuity of $w$ and its first derivatives, so passing indicates correct $C^1$ continuity.**\nThis describes a higher-order patch test. The reasoning is perfectly sound. Any polynomial of degree up to $3$ is an exact solution to the homogeneous biharmonic equation $\\nabla^4 w = 0$. Therefore, a correctly formulated finite element method should be able to reproduce these solutions exactly when they are prescribed on the boundary. The physics tying this to continuity is the same as in option A: exact reproduction implies that no spurious internal forces or moments are generated, which in turn means that the interelement discontinuities in derivatives (if any) do not produce net work for this class of solutions. Since this test is valid and its rationale is correct, it constitutes a \"correct definition\" of a patch test, albeit a stronger one than the minimal test of option A.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**E. Assemble a patch and enforce boundary data matching any $\\tilde{w}$ in the span of $\\{1, x, y, x^2, xy, y^2\\}$ with $q=0$, but require only that $w$ be continuous across element edges (no constraint on $\\partial w/\\partial n$). If these fields are reproduced nodally, $C^1$ continuity is verified because nodal interpolation of second derivatives is unnecessary for the patch test.**\nThis option fundamentally misunderstands the problem. The entire challenge of Kirchhoff-Love elements stems from the $C^1$ continuity requirement. A test designed for this problem cannot simply ignore the derivatives. To state that requiring only $C^0$ continuity verifies $C^1$ continuity is a logical contradiction. This describes a patch test for a $C^0$ problem (e.g., membrane stresses), not a $C^1$ problem like plate bending.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\text{AD}}$$", "id": "2548420"}]}
