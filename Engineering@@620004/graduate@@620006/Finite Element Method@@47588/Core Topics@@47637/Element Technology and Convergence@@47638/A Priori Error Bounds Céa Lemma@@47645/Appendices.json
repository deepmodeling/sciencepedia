It is mathematically sound, self-contained, and all terms are defined according to standard conventions in the field. I shall proceed with the solution.\n\nThe problem consists of two tasks. I will address them in order.\n\nTask A: Determination of continuity and coercivity constants.\n\nThe space is $V = H_{0}^{1}(0,1)$, equipped with the norm $\\|v\\|_{E} = \\left(\\int_{0}^{1}|v'(x)|^{2}\\,dx\\right)^{1/2}$. The bilinear form is $a(u,v)=\\int_{0}^{1} u'(x)\\,v'(x)\\,dx$.\n\nFirst, we determine the continuity constant $M$. The definition of continuity requires finding the smallest $M \\in \\mathbb{R}$ such that for all $u, v \\in V$:\n$$\n|a(u,v)| \\le M \\|u\\|_{E} \\|v\\|_{E}\n$$\nWe begin with the definition of $a(u,v)$ and apply the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality for integrals to the product of derivatives $u'(x)$ and $v'(x)$.\n$$\n|a(u,v)| = \\left|\\int_{0}^{1} u'(x)\\,v'(x)\\,dx\\right| \\le \\left(\\int_{0}^{1} |u'(x)|^{2}\\,dx\\right)^{1/2} \\left(\\int_{0}^{1} |v'(x)|^{2}\\,dx\\right)^{1/2}\n$$\nBy the definition of the energy norm $\\|\\cdot\\|_{E}$, the right-hand side is precisely $\\|u\\|_{E} \\|v\\|_{E}$. Thus, we have:\n$$\n|a(u,v)| \\le \\|u\\|_{E} \\|v\\|_{E}\n$$\nThis inequality shows that the continuity condition is satisfied with $M \\le 1$. To establish that the sharp constant is $M=1$, we must show that this bound can be attained. Consider any non-zero function $u \\in V$. If we choose $v=u$, we have:\n$$\n|a(u,u)| = \\left|\\int_{0}^{1} (u'(x))^{2}\\,dx\\right| = \\int_{0}^{1} |u'(x)|^{2}\\,dx = \\|u\\|_{E}^2\n$$\nIn this case, the inequality $|a(u,u)| \\le M \\|u\\|_{E} \\|u\\|_{E}$ becomes $\\|u\\|_{E}^2 \\le M \\|u\\|_{E}^2$, which implies $M \\ge 1$ for a non-zero $u$. Combining $M \\le 1$ and $M \\ge 1$, we conclude that the exact continuity constant is $M=1$.\n\nNext, we determine the coercivity constant $\\alpha$. The definition of coercivity requires finding the largest $\\alpha > 0$ such that for all $v \\in V$:\n$$\na(v,v) \\ge \\alpha \\|v\\|_{E}^{2}\n$$\nFrom the definitions of the bilinear form $a(\\cdot,\\cdot)$ and the energy norm $\\|\\cdot\\|_{E}$, we have:\n$$\na(v,v) = \\int_{0}^{1} v'(x)\\,v'(x)\\,dx = \\int_{0}^{1} |v'(x)|^{2}\\,dx\n$$\nAnd the square of the energy norm is:\n$$\n\\|v\\|_{E}^{2} = \\left(\\left(\\int_{0}^{1}|v'(x)|^{2}\\,dx\\right)^{1/2}\\right)^2 = \\int_{0}^{1} |v'(x)|^{2}\\,dx\n$$\nIt is immediately obvious that $a(v,v) = \\|v\\|_{E}^{2}$. The coercivity inequality becomes $\\|v\\|_{E}^{2} \\ge \\alpha \\|v\\|_{E}^{2}$. For any non-zero $v$, this holds if and only if $\\alpha \\le 1$. The largest such constant is therefore $\\alpha=1$.\n\nTask B: Computation of the best-approximation error.\n\nWe are asked to compute $\\inf_{v_{h}\\in V_{h}} \\|u-v_{h}\\|_{E}$ for $u(x)=\\sin(\\pi x)$. The space $(V, a(\\cdot, \\cdot))$ is a Hilbert space, with the inner product given by the bilinear form $a(\\cdot,\\cdot)$. The finite element space $V_h$ is a closed subspace of $V$. By the Hilbert projection theorem, for any $u \\in V$, there exists a unique best approximation $u_h^* \\in V_h$ that minimizes the distance $\\|u-v_h\\|_E$ over all $v_h \\in V_h$. This best approximation is the orthogonal projection of $u$ onto $V_h$, defined by the orthogonality condition:\n$$\na(u - u_h^*, v_h) = 0 \\quad \\forall v_h \\in V_h\n$$\nThis is the definition of the Ritz-Galerkin projection of $u$ onto $V_h$.\n\nA key property of one-dimensional problems with piecewise linear elements is that the Ritz-Galerkin projection $u_h^*$ is identical to the standard Lagrange interpolant $I_h u$. We prove this. Let $I_h u$ be the continuous, piecewise linear function such that $(I_h u)(x_i) = u(x_i)$ for all nodes $x_i$ of the mesh $\\mathcal{T}_h$. We must show that $a(u - I_h u, v_h) = 0$ for all $v_h \\in V_h$.\nThe derivative of any $v_h \\in V_h$ is piecewise constant. Let the subintervals of the mesh be $K_j = [x_j, x_{j+1}]$ for $j=0, \\dots, N-1$.\n$$\na(u - I_h u, v_h) = \\int_0^1 (u - I_h u)'(x) v_h'(x) dx = \\sum_{j=0}^{N-1} \\int_{K_j} (u - I_h u)'(x) v_h'(x) dx\n$$\nSince $v_h'$ is constant on each $K_j$, say $v_h'(x) = c_j$ for $x \\in (x_j, x_{j+1})$, we have:\n$$\na(u - I_h u, v_h) = \\sum_{j=0}^{N-1} c_j \\int_{x_j}^{x_{j+1}} (u - I_h u)'(x) dx\n$$\nBy the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, which is applicable since $u-I_h u \\in H^1(0,1)$ and thus is absolutely continuous:\n$$\n\\int_{x_j}^{x_{j+1}} (u - I_h u)'(x) dx = (u - I_h u)(x_{j+1}) - (u - I_h u)(x_j)\n$$\nBy definition of the Lagrange interpolant, $(u - I_h u)(x_k) = u(x_k) - (I_h u)(x_k) = u(x_k) - u(x_k) = 0$ at all nodes $x_k$. Therefore, the integral is $0 - 0 = 0$ for every subinterval $K_j$. This proves that $a(u - I_h u, v_h) = 0$ for all $v_h \\in V_h$.\nThus, the best approximation $u_h^*$ is indeed the interpolant $I_h u$. The quantity we must compute is $\\|u - I_h u\\|_E$.\n\nUsing the Galerkin orthogonality we just proved, $a(u - I_h u, I_h u) = 0$, we can write:\n$$\n\\|u - I_h u\\|_E^2 = a(u - I_h u, u - I_h u) = a(u - I_h u, u) - a(u - I_h u, I_h u) = a(u,u) - a(I_h u, u)\n$$\nWe compute the two terms separately. The first term is the squared norm of $u$:\n$$\na(u,u) = \\|u\\|_E^2 = \\int_0^1 (u'(x))^2 dx = \\int_0^1 (\\pi\\cos(\\pi x))^2 dx = \\pi^2 \\int_0^1 \\cos^2(\\pi x) dx\n$$\n$$\na(u,u) = \\pi^2 \\int_0^1 \\frac{1+\\cos(2\\pi x)}{2} dx = \\pi^2 \\left[\\frac{x}{2} + \\frac{\\sin(2\\pi x)}{4\\pi}\\right]_0^1 = \\pi^2 \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) = \\frac{\\pi^2}{2}\n$$\nThe second term is $a(I_h u, u) = \\int_0^1 (I_h u)'(x) u'(x) dx$. We compute this by summing over elements:\n$$\na(I_h u, u) = \\sum_{j=0}^{N-1} \\int_{x_j}^{x_{j+1}} (I_h u)'(x) u'(x) dx\n$$\nOn element $K_j = [x_j, x_{j+1}]$, where $x_j=jh$, the derivative of the linear interpolant is constant:\n$$\n(I_h u)'(x) = \\frac{u(x_{j+1}) - u(x_j)}{h} = \\frac{\\sin(\\pi(j+1)h) - \\sin(\\pi j h)}{h}\n$$\nThe integral over $K_j$ is:\n$$\n\\left(\\frac{\\sin(\\pi(j+1)h) - \\sin(\\pi j h)}{h}\\right) \\int_{jh}^{(j+1)h} \\pi\\cos(\\pi x)dx = \\frac{\\sin(\\pi(j+1)h) - \\sin(\\pi j h)}{h} [\\sin(\\pi x)]_{jh}^{(j+1)h}\n$$\n$$\n= \\frac{(\\sin(\\pi(j+1)h) - \\sin(\\pi j h))^2}{h}\n$$\nSumming over all elements $j=0, \\dots, N-1$:\n$$\na(I_h u, u) = \\frac{1}{h} \\sum_{j=0}^{N-1} (\\sin(\\pi(j+1)h) - \\sin(\\pi j h))^2\n$$\nUsing the identity $\\sin(A) - \\sin(B) = 2\\cos\\left(\\frac{A+B}{2}\\right)\\sin\\left(\\frac{A-B}{2}\\right)$:\n$$\n\\sin(\\pi(j+1)h) - \\sin(\\pi j h) = 2\\cos\\left(\\pi(j+1/2)h\\right)\\sin\\left(\\frac{\\pi h}{2}\\right)\n$$\nSo, the sum becomes:\n$$\na(I_h u, u) = \\frac{1}{h} \\sum_{j=0}^{N-1} 4\\sin^2\\left(\\frac{\\pi h}{2}\\right)\\cos^2\\left(\\pi(j+1/2)h\\right) = \\frac{4\\sin^2(\\pi h/2)}{h} \\sum_{j=0}^{N-1} \\cos^2\\left(\\pi(j+1/2)h\\right)\n$$\nWe evaluate the sum of squared cosines:\n$$\n\\sum_{j=0}^{N-1} \\cos^2\\left(\\pi(j+1/2)h\\right) = \\sum_{j=0}^{N-1} \\frac{1+\\cos(2\\pi(j+1/2)h)}{2} = \\frac{N}{2} + \\frac{1}{2}\\sum_{j=0}^{N-1}\\cos(\\pi(2j+1)h)\n$$\nThe sum of cosines is the real part of a geometric series $\\sum_{j=0}^{N-1} \\exp(i\\pi(2j+1)h) = e^{i\\pi h}\\sum_{j=0}^{N-1} (e^{i2\\pi h})^j$. Since $h=1/N$ and $N>1$, the ratio $e^{i2\\pi h} \\ne 1$. The sum is $e^{i\\pi h}\\frac{1-e^{i2\\pi hN}}{1-e^{i2\\pi h}} = e^{i\\pi h}\\frac{1-e^{i2\\pi}}{1-e^{i2\\pi h}} = 0$. Thus, $\\sum_{j=0}^{N-1}\\cos(\\pi(2j+1)h) = 0$.\nThe sum of squared cosines simplifies to $N/2$. Therefore:\n$$\na(I_h u, u) = \\frac{4\\sin^2(\\pi h/2)}{h} \\left(\\frac{N}{2}\\right) = \\frac{2N\\sin^2(\\pi h/2)}{h}\n$$\nSubstituting $N=1/h$:\n$$\na(I_h u, u) = \\frac{2\\sin^2(\\pi h/2)}{h^2}\n$$\nUsing the identity $2\\sin^2(\\theta) = 1-\\cos(2\\theta)$, this can be written as:\n$$\na(I_h u, u) = \\frac{1-\\cos(\\pi h)}{h^2}\n$$\nFinally, we compute the squared error:\n$$\n\\|u - I_h u\\|_E^2 = a(u,u) - a(I_h u, u) = \\frac{\\pi^2}{2} - \\frac{1-\\cos(\\pi h)}{h^2}\n$$\nThe best-approximation error is the square root of this quantity.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\left(\\frac{\\pi^2}{2} - \\frac{1-\\cos(\\pi h)}{h^2}\\right)^{1/2}}\n$$", "id": "2539828"}, {"introduction": "While the previous problem illustrated an ideal case, many real-world models feature parameters that can degrade the stability of the variational formulation.

The coercivity condition is $a(v,v) \\ge \\alpha \\|v\\|_{H_{0}^{1}(0,1)}^{2}$ for all $v \\in H_0^1(0,1)$.

To demonstrate this, consider the sequence of functions $v_n(x) = \\sin(n\\pi x)$ for $n \\in \\{1, 2, 3, \\dots\\}$, which belong to $H_0^1(0,1)$. The squared $L^2$-norm of $v_n$ is $\\|v_n\\|_{L^2(0,1)}^2 = \\int_0^1 \\sin^2(n\\pi x)dx = \\frac{1}{2}$, and the squared $L^2$-norm of its derivative is $\\|v_n'\\|_{L^2(0,1)}^2 = \\int_0^1 (n\\pi)^2 \\cos^2(n\\pi x)dx = \\frac{(n\\pi)^2}{2}$.

Hence, the optimal continuity constant is $M = \\epsilon + \\frac{1}{\\pi^2}$.\n\nThe ratio $M/\\alpha$ is then:\n$$ \\frac{M}{\\alpha} = \\frac{\\epsilon + \\frac{1}{\\pi^2}}{\\epsilon} = 1 + \\frac{1}{\\epsilon \\pi^2}. $$\n\nFinally, we analyze the effect of this ratio on Céa's lemma.

The constant of stability is $\\frac{M}{\\alpha} = 1 + \\frac{1}{\\epsilon \\pi^2}$. In the singularly perturbed regime where $\\epsilon \\to 0$, this constant scales as $O(\\epsilon^{-1})$ and grows without bound. A very large stability constant renders the estimate quantitatively poor in the pre-asymptotic regime (i.e., for practical mesh sizes $h$). Although the estimate remains formally valid, it becomes an extreme overestimation of the true error, making it an unreliable tool for predicting the accuracy of the numerical solution for small $\\epsilon$.

Standard approximation theory for Sobolev spaces states that if the solution $u$ belongs to $H^{s}(\\Omega)$ for some $s > 1$, then the best approximation error is bounded as\n$$ \\inf_{v_h \\in V_h} |\\!|\\!| u - v_h |\\!|\\!| \\le C' h^{\\min(k, s-1)} \\|u\\|_{H^s(\\Omega)} $$\nCombining these gives the convergence rate:\n$$ |\\!|\\!| u - u_h |\\!|\\!| \\lesssim h^{\\min(k, s-1)} $$\nThe problem states this rate is $\\lesssim h^{\\min\\{k,\\alpha\\}}$. By direct comparison, the exponent $\\alpha$ is identified with $s-1$, where $s$ is the index of Sobolev regularity of the solution $u$.\n\nFor the Poisson equation on a polygonal domain $\\Omega$, the regularity of the solution $u$ is limited by the presence of reentrant corners (corners with interior angle $\\omega > \\pi$). The solution can be expressed as a sum of a regular part and a singular part. The singular behavior near a corner with angle $\\omega$ is determined by seeking special solutions to the homogeneous Laplace equation, $\\Delta w = 0$, in polar coordinates $(r,\\theta)$ centered at the corner. We look for a solution of the form $w(r, \\theta) = r^{\\lambda} \\Phi(\\theta)$.\n\nThe Laplacian in polar coordinates is $\\Delta = \\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial r^2} + \\frac{1}{r}\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial r} + \\frac{1}{r^2}\\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial\\theta^2}$. Substituting $w(r, \\theta) = r^{\\lambda} \\Phi(\\theta)$ into $\\Delta w = 0$ yields:\n$$ \\Delta w = \\lambda(\\lambda-1)r^{\\lambda-2}\\Phi(\\theta) + \\lambda r^{\\lambda-2}\\Phi(\\theta) + r^{\\lambda-2}\\Phi''(\\theta) = 0 $$\nFor $r>0$, this simplifies to an ordinary differential equation for $\\Phi(\\theta)$:\n$$ \\Phi''(\\theta) + \\lambda^2 \\Phi(\\theta) = 0 $$\nThe general solution is $\\Phi(\\theta) = C_1 \\cos(\\lambda\\theta) + C_2 \\sin(\\lambda\\theta)$. The homogeneous Dirichlet boundary conditions $u=0$ on $\\partial\\Omega$ translate to $\\Phi=0$ on the edges of the corner. Aligning one edge with $\\theta=0$ and the other with $\\theta=\\omega$, we have:\n$1$. $\\Phi(0) = 0 \\implies C_1 \\cos(0) + C_2 \\sin(0) = 0 \\implies C_1 = 0$.\n$2$. $\\Phi(\\omega) = 0 \\implies C_2 \\sin(\\lambda\\omega) = 0$.\n\nFor a non-trivial solution ($C_2 \\neq 0$), we must have $\\sin(\\lambda\\omega) = 0$. This implies $\\lambda\\omega = m\\pi$ for some integer $m \\in \\mathbb{Z}$. The smallest positive exponent $\\lambda$ that corresponds to a function in $H^1_0$ but not in $H^2$ is for $m=1$, giving the leading singularity exponent:\n$$ \\lambda = \\frac{\\pi}{\\omega} $$\nThis exponent determines the local regularity. A solution $u$ near a corner with angle $\\omega$ is in $H^{s}_{loc}$ if and only if $s  1 + \\lambda = 1 + \\frac{\\pi}{\\omega}$. The global regularity of $u$ over the entire domain $\\Omega$ is limited by the worst singularity, which corresponds to the smallest exponent $\\lambda$ among all reentrant corners.\nThe global regularity index $s$ is therefore $s = 1 + \\min_{\\text{all corners } i} (\\lambda_i) - \\epsilon$ for any $\\epsilon>0$, where $\\lambda_i = \\pi/\\omega_i$. The exponent $\\alpha=s-1$ in the convergence rate is thus the minimum of all such singularity exponents:\n$$ \\alpha = \\min_{\\text{reentrant corners } i} \\left( \\frac{\\pi}{\\omega_i} \\right) $$\n\nThe given domain has two reentrant corners with interior angles $\\omega_{A} = \\frac{3\\pi}{2}$ and $\\omega_{B} = \\frac{7\\pi}{4}$. The other angles are less than $\\pi$ and do not introduce singularities that limit the regularity below $H^2$. We compute the singularity exponents for the two reentrant corners:\nFor corner A:\n$$ \\lambda_A = \\frac{\\pi}{\\omega_A} = \\frac{\\pi}{\\frac{3\\pi}{2}} = \\frac{2}{3} $$\nFor corner B:\n$$ \\lambda_B = \\frac{\\pi}{\\omega_B} = \\frac{\\pi}{\\frac{7\\pi}{4}} = \\frac{4}{7} $$\nThe exponent $\\alpha$ that governs the overall convergence rate is the minimum of these values, as the least regular part of the solution determines the global regularity and thus the global convergence rate. We must compare $\\lambda_A$ and $\\lambda_B$:\n$$ \\lambda_A = \\frac{2}{3} = \\frac{14}{21} $$\n$$ \\lambda_B = \\frac{4}{7} = \\frac{12}{21} $$\nClearly, $\\frac{12}{21}  \\frac{14}{21}$, so $\\lambda_B  \\lambda_A$.\nTherefore, the exponent $\\alpha$ is:\n$$ \\alpha = \\min\\left(\\frac{2}{3}, \\frac{4}{7}\\right) = \\frac{4}{7} $$\nThis value represents the limit on the convergence rate imposed by the corner with the largest interior angle, $\\omega_B = \\frac{7\\pi}{4}$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{4}{7}}$$", "id": "2539875"}]}
