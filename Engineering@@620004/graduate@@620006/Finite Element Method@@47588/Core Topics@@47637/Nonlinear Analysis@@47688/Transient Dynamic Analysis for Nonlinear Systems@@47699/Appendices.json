The derivation will proceed in three stages as specified: first, deriving the semi-discrete equations of motion; second, performing a dispersion analysis to find the maximum natural frequency of the discrete system; and third, performing a stability analysis of the time integrator to relate the critical time step to this maximum frequency.\n\nFirst, we establish the semi-discrete equation of motion for an interior node of a uniform finite element mesh. For a one-dimensional, two-node bar element of length $h$, constant cross-section $A$, tangent modulus $E_t$, and mass density $\\rho$, the element stiffness matrix $\\mathbf{K}^e$ is given by:\n$$\n\\mathbf{K}^e = \\frac{A E_t}{h}\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n1 & -1 \\\\\n-1 & 1\n\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe problem specifies a diagonal (lumped) mass matrix. The total mass of the element is $m^e = \\rho A h$. This mass is distributed equally to the two nodes, resulting in the element mass matrix $\\mathbf{M}^e$:\n$$\n\\mathbf{M}^e = \\frac{\\rho A h}{2}\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n1 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 1\n\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nWe consider an infinite, uniform mesh and focus on an arbitrary interior node $j$. This node is connected to its neighbors, node $j-1$ and node $j+1$, through two adjacent elements, element $(j-1, j)$ and element $(j, j+1)$. The global equation of motion for the system is $\\mathbf{M}\\ddot{\\mathbf{u}} + \\mathbf{K}\\mathbf{u} = \\mathbf{F}_{ext}$. For free vibration, $\\mathbf{F}_{ext} = \\mathbf{0}$. The equation for the degree of freedom $u_j$ at node $j$ is assembled from the contributions of the two adjacent elements.\n\nThe mass associated with node $j$ is the sum of contributions from each element:\n$$\nM_{jj} = \\left(\\mathbf{M}^e\\right)_{22} + \\left(\\mathbf{M}^e\\right)_{11} = \\frac{\\rho A h}{2} + \\frac{\\rho A h}{2} = \\rho A h\n$$\nThe internal force on node $j$ is the sum of forces from the stiffness of the two elements. The force on node $j$ from element $(j-1, j)$ is $\\frac{A E_t}{h}(-u_{j-1} + u_j)$. The force on node $j$ from element $(j, j+1)$ is $\\frac{A E_t}{h}(u_j - u_{j+1})$.

The sine function has a maximum absolute value of $1$. This occurs when its argument is an odd multiple of $\\pi/2$. The highest frequency mode corresponds to the shortest wavelength the mesh can represent, which is $\\lambda_{\\min} = 2h$. The wave number for this mode is $k_{\\max} = 2\\pi/\\lambda_{\\min} = \\pi/h$. Substituting this into the dispersion relation:\n$$\n\\omega_{\\max} = \\sqrt{\\frac{4c^2}{h^2} \\sin^2\\left(\\frac{(\\pi/h)h}{2}\\right)} = \\frac{2c}{h} \\left|\\sin\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\right)\\right| = \\frac{2c}{h}\n$$\n\nThird, we analyze the stability of the central difference method for the scalar harmonic oscillator equation $\\ddot{y} + \\omega^2 y = 0$. The central difference approximation for the second derivative is $\\ddot{y}_n \\approx (y_{n+1} - 2y_n + y_{n-1})/(\\Delta t)^2$. Substituting this into the model equation gives the recurrence relation:\n$$\n\\frac{y_{n+1} - 2y_n + y_{n-1}}{(\\Delta t)^2} + \\omega^2 y_n = 0\n$$\n$$\ny_{n+1} = (2 - (\\omega \\Delta t)^2) y_n - y_{n-1}\n$$\nTo analyze stability, we assume a solution of the form $y_n = G^n$, where $G$ is an amplification factor. Substituting this into the recurrence relation gives the characteristic equation for $G$:\n$$\nG^{n+1} = (2 - (\\omega \\Delta t)^2) G^n - G^{n-1}\n$$\n$$\nG^2 - (2 - (\\omega \\Delta t)^2) G + 1 = 0\n$$\nFor the numerical solution to remain bounded (stable), the magnitudes of the roots $G$ of this quadratic equation must not exceed $1$, i.e., $|G| \\le 1$. The roots are:\n$$\nG = \\frac{(2 - (\\omega \\Delta t)^2) \\pm \\sqrt{(2 - (\\omega \\Delta t)^2)^2 - 4}}{2}\n$$\nThe solution becomes unstable if any root has a magnitude greater than $1$. This occurs when the roots are real and unequal, which happens when the discriminant is positive. A positive discriminant requires $(2 - (\\omega \\Delta t)^2)^2 > 4$, or $|2 - (\\omega \\Delta t)^2| > 2$. This inequality holds if $2 - (\\omega \\Delta t)^2 > 2$ (which is impossible as $-(\\omega \\Delta t)^2 \\le 0$) or if $2 - (\\omega \\Delta t)^2 < -2$. The latter condition gives $(\\omega \\Delta t)^2 > 4$, or $|\\omega \\Delta t| > 2$.\nTherefore, for stability, we must have $|\\omega \\Delta t| \\le 2$. The integration scheme must be stable for all frequencies present in the semi-discrete system. This requires the condition to hold for the maximum frequency, $\\omega_{\\max}$:\n$$\n\\omega_{\\max} \\Delta t \\le 2\n$$\nThe critical time step, $\\Delta t_{\\text{crit}}$, is the largest value of $\\Delta t$ for which this condition is met:\n$$\n\\Delta t_{\\text{crit}} = \\frac{2}{\\omega_{\\max}}\n$$\n\nFinally, we combine the results. Substituting the expression for $\\omega_{\\max} = 2c/h$ into the equation for $\\Delta t_{\\text{crit}}$:\n$$\n\\Delta t_{\\text{crit}} = \\frac{2}{2c/h} = \\frac{h}{c}\n$$\nThis represents the Courant-Friedrichs-Lewy (CFL) condition for this particular numerical scheme, stating that the time step must be no larger than the time it takes for a wave to travel across one element.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\frac{h}{c}}\n$$", "id": "2607423"}, {"introduction": "To enhance computational efficiency in large-scale simulations, analysts often employ under-integrated finite elements.

Increasing the stiffness-like hourglass parameter always increases the maximum stable explicit time step because the added stiffness suppresses unphysical modes, thereby improving numerical stability without affecting the highest physical frequencies.\n\nOnly consider scientifically defensible arguments and scalings derived from the governing equations and standard properties of the explicit central difference method; do not assume any proprietary formulation details.", "solution": "The semidiscrete equation of motion for the finite element system is given as:\n$$ \\mathbf{M}\\,\\ddot{\\mathbf{u}} + \\mathbf{f}_{\\mathrm{int}}(\\mathbf{u}) = \\mathbf{f}_{\\mathrm{ext}} $$\nwhere $\\mathbf{M}$ is the diagonal lumped mass matrix, $\\mathbf{u}$ is the vector of nodal displacements, $\\mathbf{f}_{\\mathrm{int}}$ is the vector of internal forces, and $\\mathbf{f}_{\\mathrm{ext}}$ is the vector of external forces. Using under-integrated elements, certain deformation modes—the hourglass modes—produce zero strain at the integration points. Consequently, they contribute nothing to the strain energy and thus nothing to the internal force vector, $\\mathbf{f}_{\\mathrm{int}}$. These modes are unresisted and can grow spuriously in a dynamic simulation.

The critical time step is $\\Delta t_{\\mathrm{crit}} \\le 2/\\omega_{\\max}$. The highest frequency $\\omega_{\\max}$ is determined by the minimum time it takes for a wave to travel across an element, i.e., $\\omega_{\\max} \\approx c_{\\max}/h_{\\min}$, where $c_{\\max}$ is the fastest wave speed in the material and $h_{\\min}$ is a characteristic dimension of the smallest element.

The linearized equation of motion becomes $\\mathbf{M}\\,\\ddot{\\mathbf{u}} + (\\mathbf{K}_{\\mathrm{tan}} + \\mathbf{K}_{h})\\mathbf{u} = \\mathbf{f}_{\\mathrm{ext}}$. The total system stiffness is increased. Since $\\mathbf{K}_{h}$ is a positive semi-definite matrix, adding it to $\\mathbf{K}_{\\mathrm{tan}}$ will increase (or leave unchanged) the eigenvalues of $\\mathbf{M}^{-1}\\mathbf{K}_{\\mathrm{Total}}$. This leads to a higher maximum frequency, $\\omega'_{\\max} \\ge \\omega_{\\max}$. Consequently, the critical time step is reduced: $\\Delta t'_{\\mathrm{crit}} \\le 2/\\omega'_{\\max} \\le \\Delta t_{\\mathrm{crit}}$.\n\n2.  **Viscosity-like control**: Here, $\\mathbf{f}_{h} = \\mathbf{C}_{h}\\dot{\\mathbf{u}}$, where $\\mathbf{C}_{h}$ is an artificial viscous damping matrix projected onto the hourglass subspace. The goal is to add damping specifically to the unphysical, high-frequency hourglass modes without affecting the physical, long-wavelength modes. A properly formulated viscous control projects the velocity field onto the hourglass modal basis and applies a force proportional to the rate of hourglassing. For a long-wavelength disturbance, the displacement field across a single element is nearly linear. An hourglass operator, by definition, is orthogonal to rigid-body motions and constant strain fields (which arise from linear displacement fields). Therefore, such an operator will produce nearly zero force for long-wavelength modes, preserving their phase velocity and physical behavior.\n    For an unforced single hourglass mode, the equation is $m_{h}\\ddot{u}_{h} + c_{h}\\dot{u}_{h} = 0$, where $m_{h}$ is the modal mass, $u_{h}$ is the modal displacement, and $c_{h}$ is the modal viscosity. The characteristic equation is $m_{h}s^2 + c_{h}s = 0$. The solution is damped. To achieve a specified damping ratio $\\zeta_{h}$ at a certain frequency $\\omega_{h}$, we use the standard formula for a second-order system: $c_{h} = 2\\zeta_{h}m_{h}\\omega_{h}$. The frequency $\\omega_{h}$ is chosen to be representative of the hourglass phenomenon, which is a high-wavenumber mode. A wavelength of $\\lambda=2h$ (where $h$ is the element size) is appropriate, corresponding to the Nyquist frequency. The frequency is then $\\omega_{h} = 2\\pi c / \\lambda = \\pi c/h$, where $c$ is a relevant wave speed, such as the tangent shear wave speed $c_{s}$. The modal mass $m_{h}$ is some fraction of the total element mass. This provides a principled calibration procedure. Adding such viscosity has a small effect on the stability limit, which for a damped system is $\\Delta t \\le \\frac{2}{\\omega_{\\max}} (\\sqrt{1+\\xi_{\\max}^2} - \\xi_{\\max})$. Since the viscosity is targeted and usually small ($\\zeta_h \\ll 1$), this reduction is minimal compared to the significant reduction from stiffness-based control.\n\nNow, we evaluate each statement.\n\n**A. Adding a stiffness-like hourglass control raises the highest discrete frequency in the spectrum of the linearized system and therefore tightens the explicit time-step limit $\\Delta t_{\\mathrm{crit}}$; by contrast, a viscosity-like hourglass control that is projected onto the hourglass subspace and calibrated to target a damping ratio at a high wavenumber (e.g., near the Nyquist limit) can suppress spurious modes while preserving long-wavelength phase velocity.

To avoid affecting shear waves, the hourglass viscosity should be scaled with the bulk modulus $K$ so that $\\eta_{h}\\propto K$; this ensures that only volumetric hourglass patterns are damped and that the explicit time-step limit $\\Delta t_{\\mathrm{crit}}$ increases because the stabilizing forces act against unphysical deformations.**\n- The primary hourglass modes in trilinear hexahedra are deviatoric (shear-like) in nature. Scaling the control with the bulk modulus $K$ would primarily damp volumetric modes, which is not the main problem. To avoid affecting *physical* shear waves, the control should be orthogonal to them, not scaled with a property ($K$) unrelated to shear. The premise is flawed.\n- The claim that $\\Delta t_{\\mathrm{crit}}$ *increases* is fundamentally false. Adding any form of stabilization, whether stiffness or damping, cannot increase the stable time step. Stiffness control *decreases* it. Viscous control at best leaves it nearly unchanged or slightly decreases it. The argument that suppressing unphysical modes improves stability in a way that allows for a larger time step conflates two different types of stability (modal vs. numerical integration).\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. Global Rayleigh damping calibrated to critically damp the element’s highest mode is an appropriate substitute for hourglass viscosity: it suppresses hourglass instabilities while leaving the explicit stability limit unchanged and does not alter the phase velocity of physical waves.**\n- Rayleigh damping, $\\mathbf{C} = \\alpha_R \\mathbf{M} + \\beta_R \\mathbf{K}$, is not a targeted control. It introduces damping across all modes. While a large $\\beta_R$ can damp high-frequency modes (including hourglass), the $\\alpha_R \\mathbf{M}$ term heavily damps low-frequency physical modes, which is undesirable and corrupts phase accuracy. Thus, it *does* alter the phase velocity of physical waves.\n- Calibrating it to *critically damp* ($\\zeta=1$) the highest mode means the damping ratio at $\\omega_{\\max}$ is $\\xi_{\\max}=1$. The stability limit becomes $\\Delta t \\le \\frac{2}{\\omega_{\\max}} (\\sqrt{1+1^2} - 1) \\approx 0.414 (2/\\omega_{\\max})$.

The estimation of modal mass as a fraction of the element mass is a common practice.\n- The final conclusion is correct: because $\\mathbf{H}$ annihilates linear fields, it correctly leaves long-wavelength physical modes unaffected, thus preserving their phase velocity. The assertion that $\\alpha$ is of order unity is a slight imprecision (it's typically a fraction less than $1$), but in the context of order-of-magnitude estimation, this does not invalidate the statement's fundamental correctness.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**E. Increasing the stiffness-like hourglass parameter always increases the maximum stable explicit time step because the added stiffness suppresses unphysical modes, thereby improving numerical stability without affecting the highest physical frequencies.**\n- This statement is fundamentally incorrect.

In a nonlinear transient analysis, proportional damping may be defined with the tangent stiffness matrix of the selected linearization, so calibration of ($a_0,a_1$) is performed using the undamped natural frequencies of that linearized system; the resulting ($a_0,a_1$) do not depend on how the eigenvectors are normalized.", "solution": "The semi-discrete equation of motion for a general nonlinear system is given by $\\boldsymbol{M}\\ddot{\\boldsymbol{u}} + \\boldsymbol{P}(\\boldsymbol{u}, \\dot{\\boldsymbol{u}}) = \\boldsymbol{F}_{\\text{ext}}(t)$, where $\\boldsymbol{P}$ is the vector of internal forces.

Mode 2: $\\omega_2 = 120\\,\\mathrm{rad/s}$, $\\zeta_2 = 0.06$\n\nThis yields a system of two linear equations:\n$$ 2(0.02) = \\frac{a_0}{30} + a_1(30) \\implies 0.04 = \\frac{a_0}{30} + 30a_1 $$\n$$ 2(0.06) = \\frac{a_0}{120} + a_1(120) \\implies 0.12 = \\frac{a_0}{120} + 120a_1 $$\nThis can be written in matrix form:\n$$ \\begin{pmatrix} 1/30 & 30 \\\\ 1/120 & 120 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} a_0 \\\\ a_1 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0.04 \\\\ 0.12 \\end{pmatrix} $$\nWe solve this system for $(a_0, a_1)$. From the first equation, $a_0 = 30(0.04 - 30a_1) = 1.2 - 900a_1$. Substituting this into the second equation:\n$$ 0.12 = \\frac{1.2 - 900a_1}{120} + 120a_1 $$\n$$ 0.12 = 0.01 - 7.5a_1 + 120a_1 $$\n$$ 0.11 = 112.5a_1 $$\n$$ a_1 = \\frac{0.11}{112.5} = \\frac{110}{112500} = \\frac{11}{11250} \\approx 9.777... \\times 10^{-4}\\,\\mathrm{s} $$\nNow, we find $a_0$:\n$$ a_0 = 1.2 - 900 \\left( \\frac{0.11}{112.5} \\right) = 1.2 - \\frac{99}{112.5} = 1.2 - 0.88 = 0.32\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1} $$\nThe units are derived from the calibration equation: $a_1\\omega_r$ must be dimensionless, so $a_1$ has units of time ($s$). $a_0/\\omega_r$ must be dimensionless, so $a_0$ has units of frequency ($s^{-1}$).\n\nNow we evaluate each option.\n\nA. Use $\\boldsymbol{C} = a_0 \\boldsymbol{M} + a_1 \\boldsymbol{K}_{\\mathrm{T}}$ with $\\boldsymbol{K}_{\\mathrm{T}}$ taken at the linearization configuration, calibrate ($a_0,a_1$) from the two target undamped modes of the linearized system, and obtain the numerical values $a_0 = 0.32\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$ and $a_1 = 9.78 \\times 10^{-4}\\,\\mathrm{s}$ for the given targets at $\\omega_1 = 30\\,\\mathrm{rad/s}$ and $\\omega_2 = 120\\,\\mathrm{rad/s}$.\nThis option correctly states the form of the Rayleigh damping matrix using the tangent stiffness. The specified calibration procedure is correct. The calculated values $a_0 = 0.32\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$ and $a_1 \\approx 9.78 \\times 10^{-4}\\,\\mathrm{s}$ (rounded) match our derivation precisely.\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\nB. Use $\\boldsymbol{C} = a_0 \\boldsymbol{M} + a_1 \\boldsymbol{K}_{\\mathrm{T}}$ but calibrate via the relation $2\\zeta_r = a_0\\omega_r + a_1/\\omega_r$ for each mode $r$, which yields $a_0 = 9.78 \\times 10^{-4}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$ and $a_1 = 0.32\\,\\mathrm{s}$ for the targets at $\\omega_1 = 30\\,\\mathrm{rad/s}$ and $\\omega_2 = 120\\,\\mathrm{rad/s}$.\nThe calibration relation $2\\zeta_r = a_0\\omega_r + a_1/\\omega_r$ is incorrect. It improperly associates $a_0$ with $\\omega_r$ and $a_1$ with $1/\\omega_r$. The correct relation is $2\\zeta_r = a_0/\\omega_r + a_1\\omega_r$. This error leads to a dimensionally inconsistent formula and consequently incorrect assignment of the computed numerical values to the coefficients. The reported values for $a_0$ and $a_1$ are swapped.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\nC. The calibrated coefficients ($a_0,a_1$) depend on the arbitrary scaling of the eigenvectors; therefore, changing the normalization of the mode shapes changes the computed ($a_0,a_1$).\nThis statement is false. As shown in the derivation, the calibration equation $2\\zeta_r = a_0/\\omega_r + a_1\\omega_r$ is derived from ratios of modal quantities (e.g., $\\boldsymbol{\\phi}_r^T \\boldsymbol{K}_{\\mathrm{T}} \\boldsymbol{\\phi}_r / \\boldsymbol{\\phi}_r^T \\boldsymbol{M} \\boldsymbol{\\phi}_r = \\omega_r^2$). Any scaling factor applied to an eigenvector $\\boldsymbol{\\phi}_r$ cancels out in these ratios. Therefore, the natural frequencies $\\omega_r$ and modal damping ratios $\\zeta_r$ are invariant to eigenvector normalization. Since the coefficients $(a_0,a_1)$ are determined solely from $(\\omega_r, \\zeta_r)$ pairs, they are also independent of eigenvector normalization.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\nD. It is acceptable to replace angular frequencies by cyclic frequencies in hertz during calibration; using $f_1 = \\omega_1/(2\\pi)$ and $f_2 = \\omega_2/(2\\pi)$ in place of $\\omega_1$ and $\\omega_2$ yields $a_0 \\approx 0.051\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$ and $a_1 \\approx 6.15 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{s}$ for the given targets.\nThis procedure is fundamentally incorrect. The derivation of the calibration formula relies on the angular frequency $\\omega$ (in rad/s) as it appears in the standard form of the second-order differential equation for an oscillator. Replacing $\\omega$ with cyclic frequency $f = \\omega/(2\\pi)$ (in Hz) constitutes a dimensional error. While the option provides arithmetically correct results for this flawed procedure, the premise that such a substitution is \"acceptable\" is false. This is a severe conceptual mistake.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\nE. In a nonlinear transient analysis, proportional damping may be defined with the tangent stiffness matrix of the selected linearization, so calibration of ($a_0,a_1$) is performed using the undamped natural frequencies of that linearized system; the resulting ($a_0,a_1$) do not depend on how the eigenvectors are normalized.\nThis option presents two correct conceptual statements. First, it accurately describes a standard and valid methodology for applying Rayleigh damping in a nonlinear analysis context: using the tangent stiffness matrix from a specific linearized state and calibrating based on the properties of that state. Second, it correctly states that the resulting coefficients $(a_0,a_1)$ are independent of eigenvector normalization, which is a fundamental property of the calibration method as demonstrated in the analysis for option C.\nVerdict: **Correct**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{AE}$$", "id": "2607433"}]}
