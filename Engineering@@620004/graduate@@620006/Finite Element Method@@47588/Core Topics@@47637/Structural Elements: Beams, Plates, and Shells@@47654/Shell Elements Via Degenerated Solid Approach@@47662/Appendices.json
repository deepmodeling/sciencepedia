It is found to be self-contained, scientifically grounded in the classical theory of plates and shells, and mathematically well-posed. We shall proceed with the derivation.\n\nThe fundamental premise of the degenerated solid approach (DSA) is to describe the kinematics of a three-dimensional body using the motion of its midsurface and a director vector. For a flat plate, the position vector $\\mathbf{X}$ of an arbitrary point in the undeformed configuration is given by\n$$\n\\mathbf{X}(x, y, z) = \\mathbf{x}_m(x,y) + z \\mathbf{e}_3\n$$\nwhere $\\mathbf{x}_m(x,y) = x \\mathbf{e}_1 + y \\mathbf{e}_2$ is the position vector of a point on the midsurface, and $\\mathbf{e}_3$ is the unit normal director. The coordinate $z$ lies in the interval $[-t/2, t/2]$.\n\nAfter deformation, the position of the same material point is described by\n$$\n\\mathbf{x}(x, y, z) = \\mathbf{x}_m^{\\text{def}}(x,y) + z \\mathbf{d}(x,y)\n$$\nwhere $\\mathbf{x}_m^{\\text{def}}$ is the deformed position of the midsurface point and $\\mathbf{d}$ is the deformed director. The displacement vector $\\mathbf{u}(x, y, z)$ is the difference between the deformed and undeformed positions:\n$$\n\\mathbf{u}(x, y, z) = \\mathbf{x}(x, y, z) - \\mathbf{X}(x, y, z) = (\\mathbf{x}_m^{\\text{def}} - \\mathbf{x}_m) + z (\\mathbf{d} - \\mathbf{e}_3)\n$$\nLet the displacement of the midsurface be $\\mathbf{u}_m(x,y) = u(x,y)\\mathbf{e}_1 + v(x,y)\\mathbf{e}_2 + w(x,y)\\mathbf{e}_3$. The problem specifies a state of pure bending, which implies the midsurface experiences no membrane deformation. For small displacements, this allows us to set the in-plane midsurface displacements to zero, $u(x,y) = 0$ and $v(x,y) = 0$. Thus, the midsurface displacement is purely transverse: $\\mathbf{u}_m(x,y) = w(x,y)\\mathbf{e}_3$.\n\nThe kinematic assumptions of Kirchhoff-Love theory, as specified, dictate that the director remains straight and normal to the deformed midsurface. The deformed midsurface is parameterized by $\\mathbf{r}(x,y) = x \\mathbf{e}_1 + y \\mathbf{e}_2 + w(x,y) \\mathbf{e}_3$. The tangent vectors to this surface are:\n$$\n\\mathbf{r}_{,x} = \\mathbf{e}_1 + w_{,x} \\mathbf{e}_3 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\mathbf{r}_{,y} = \\mathbf{e}_2 + w_{,y} \\mathbf{e}_3\n$$\nThe normal vector to the deformed midsurface is found by the cross product:\n$$\n\\mathbf{N} = \\mathbf{r}_{,x} \\times \\mathbf{r}_{,y} = (\\mathbf{e}_1 + w_{,x} \\mathbf{e}_3) \\times (\\mathbf{e}_2 + w_{,y} \\mathbf{e}_3) = -w_{,x} \\mathbf{e}_1 - w_{,y} \\mathbf{e}_2 + \\mathbf{e}_3\n$$\nThe deformed director $\\mathbf{d}$ is the unit vector in the direction of $\\mathbf{N}$.\n$$\n\\mathbf{d} = \\frac{\\mathbf{N}}{|\\mathbf{N}|} = \\frac{-w_{,x} \\mathbf{e}_1 - w_{,y} \\mathbf{e}_2 + \\mathbf{e}_3}{\\sqrt{w_{,x}^2 + w_{,y}^2 + 1}}\n$$\nUnder the small-rotation assumption, the slopes $w_{,x}$ and $w_{,y}$ are small quantities. Thus, the denominator can be linearized: $\\sqrt{1 + w_{,x}^2 + w_{,y}^2} \\approx 1$. The linearized deformed director is therefore:\n$$\n\\mathbf{d} \\approx -w_{,x} \\mathbf{e}_1 - w_{,y} \\mathbf{e}_2 + \\mathbf{e}_3\n$$\nSubstituting the midsurface displacement and the linearized director into the general displacement equation yields the displacement field components throughout the thickness:\n$$\n\\mathbf{u}(x, y, z) = w(x,y)\\mathbf{e}_3 + z ((-w_{,x} \\mathbf{e}_1 - w_{,y} \\mathbf{e}_2 + \\mathbf{e}_3) - \\mathbf{e}_3) = -z w_{,x} \\mathbf{e}_1 - z w_{,y} \\mathbf{e}_2 + w \\mathbf{e}_3\n$$\nThe components of the displacement vector $\\mathbf{u} = u_x \\mathbf{e}_1 + u_y \\mathbf{e}_2 + u_z \\mathbf{e}_3$ are:\n$$\nu_x(x,y,z) = -z w_{,x}(x,y)\n$$\n$$\nu_y(x,y,z) = -z w_{,y}(x,y)\n$$\n$$\nu_z(x,y,z) = w(x,y)\n$$\nThis displacement field correctly satisfies the Kirchhoff-Love hypothesis of zero transverse shear strain:\n$$\n\\varepsilon_{xz} = \\frac{1}{2}(u_{x,z} + u_{z,x}) = \\frac{1}{2}(\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z}(-z w_{,x}) + \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}(w)) = \\frac{1}{2}(-w_{,x} + w_{,x}) = 0\n$$\n$$\n\\varepsilon_{yz} = \\frac{1}{2}(u_{y,z} + u_{z,y}) = \\frac{1}{2}(\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z}(-z w_{,y}) + \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}(w)) = \\frac{1}{2}(-w_{,y} + w_{,y}) = 0\n$$\nNow, we compute the in-plane strain components using the small-strain definition $\\varepsilon_{ij} = \\frac{1}{2}(u_{i,j} + u_{j,i})$.\nThe normal strain in the $x$-direction is:\n$$\n\\varepsilon_{xx} = u_{x,x} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}(-z w_{,x}) = -z w_{,xx}\n$$\nThe normal strain in the $y$-direction is:\n$$\n\\varepsilon_{yy} = u_{y,y} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}(-z w_{,y}) = -z w_{,yy}\n$$\nThe tensor shear strain in the $x\\text{-}y$ plane is:\n$$\n\\varepsilon_{xy} = \\frac{1}{2}(u_{x,y} + u_{y,x}) = \\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}(-z w_{,x}) + \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}(-z w_{,y})\\right) = \\frac{1}{2}(-z w_{,xy} - z w_{,yx})\n$$\nAssuming the displacement function $w(x,y)$ is sufficiently smooth, the order of differentiation does not matter ($w_{,xy} = w_{,yx}$), so:\n$$\n\\varepsilon_{xy} = -z w_{,xy}\n$$\nThe problem requires the engineering shear strain, $\\gamma_{xy}$, which is defined as $\\gamma_{xy} = 2 \\varepsilon_{xy}$.\n$$\n\\gamma_{xy} = -2z w_{,xy}\n$$\nSubstituting the given definitions for curvature components, $\\kappa_x = w_{,xx}$, $\\kappa_y = w_{,yy}$, and $\\kappa_{xy} = w_{,xy}$, we obtain the final expressions for the strains as a function of the thickness coordinate $z$ and the midsurface curvatures:\n$$\n\\varepsilon_{xx}(z) = -z \\kappa_x\n$$\n$$\n\\varepsilon_{yy}(z) = -z \\kappa_y\n$$\n$$\n\\gamma_{xy}(z) = -2z \\kappa_{xy}\n$$\nThese results demonstrate a linear variation of in-plane strains through the thickness, which is a classical result of Kirchhoff-Love plate theory.\n\nFinally, we must verify that the membrane strains vanish at the midsurface, $z=0$. Evaluating the derived expressions at $z=0$:\n$$\n\\varepsilon_{xx}(0) = -(0)\\kappa_x = 0\n$$\n$$\n\\varepsilon_{yy}(0) = -(0)\\kappa_y = 0\n$$\n$$\n\\gamma_{xy}(0) = -2(0)\\kappa_{xy} = 0\n$$\nThis confirms the condition of zero membrane deformation on the midsurface, consistent with the initial problem statement of pure bending.

The degenerated solid approach, isoparametric formulation, and Mindlin-Reissner kinematics (implied by the affine displacement field in $\\zeta$) are standard concepts. The assumptions, while simplifying, are not contradictory and serve to define a specific, solvable theoretical case. The problem is well-posed, objective, and complete. The key assumptions are:\n\n1.  \"affine in-plane geometric mapping\": This implies a mapping of the form $\\mathbf{x}_{mid}(\\xi, \\eta) = \\mathbf{A} \\begin{pmatrix} \\xi \\\\ \\eta \\end{pmatrix} + \\mathbf{b}$, where $\\mathbf{A}$ is a constant $2 \\times 2$ matrix and $\\mathbf{b}$ is a constant vector. This describes a parallelogram-shaped element. Consequently, the in-plane Jacobian matrix is constant, and its determinant is also constant, consistent with the problem statement.\n2.  \"displacement field is affine in $\\zeta$\": This is the fundamental kinematic assumption of Mindlin-Reissner shell theory, $\\mathbf{u}(\\xi, \\eta, \\zeta) = \\mathbf{u}_{mid}(\\xi, \\eta) + \\zeta \\mathbf{u}_{rot}(\\xi, \\eta)$.\n3.  \"constant-thickness\": This simplifies the Jacobian of the 3D mapping.\n\nThese assumptions are stringent but self-consistent, creating a valid theoretical problem.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\n\nThe problem is **valid**. A solution will be derived.\n\n**Derivation of Solution**\n\nThe element stiffness matrix $K^e$ is computed by integrating over the element's volume, which is transformed to an integral over the parametric domain $[-1, 1]^3$:\n$$ K^e = \\int_{V^e} B^\\top C B \\, dV = \\int_{-1}^{1}\\int_{-1}^{1}\\int_{-1}^{1} B^\\top(\\xi, \\eta, \\zeta) \\, C \\, B(\\xi, \\eta, \\zeta) \\, \\det(J(\\xi, \\eta, \\zeta)) \\, d\\xi \\, d\\eta \\, d\\zeta $$\nHere, $B$ is the strain-displacement matrix, $C$ is the constant material constitutive matrix, and $J$ is the Jacobian of the geometric mapping $\\mathbf{x}(\\xi, \\eta, \\zeta)$. The task is to determine the polynomial degree of the integrand function, which we denote as $I(\\xi, \\eta, \\zeta) = B^\\top C B \\det(J)$, to find the minimal Gauss quadrature order for exact integration.\n\n1.  **Analysis of the Jacobian determinant $\\det(J)$:**\n    The position of a point is given by the degenerated solid approach: $\\mathbf{x}(\\xi, \\eta, \\zeta) = \\mathbf{x}_{mid}(\\xi, \\eta) + \\frac{\\zeta h}{2}\\mathbf{n}_z$, where for a flat plate of constant thickness $h$, $\\mathbf{x}_{mid}$ is the position on the mid-plane and $\\mathbf{n}_z$ is the unit normal vector, here assumed constant $[0, 0, 1]^\\top$. The affine in-plane mapping makes the in-plane Jacobian $J_{2D} = \\frac{\\partial(x, y)}{\\partial(\\xi, \\eta)}$ a constant matrix. The full Jacobian is:\n    $$ J = \\begin{pmatrix} J_{2D} & \\mathbf{0} \\\\ \\mathbf{0}^\\top & h/2 \\end{pmatrix} $$\n    Thus, $\\det(J) = \\det(J_{2D}) \\cdot \\frac{h}{2} = \\text{constant}$. The Jacobian determinant does not contribute to the polynomial degree of the integrand.\n\n2.  **Analysis of the Strain-Displacement Matrix $B$ for Bending:**\n    The problem asks to focus on the bending contribution. The kinematics are based on the Mindlin-Reissner theory, where the displacement field is affine in $\\zeta$:\n    $$ \\mathbf{u}(\\xi, \\eta, \\zeta) = \\sum_{i=1}^{4} N_i(\\xi, \\eta) \\mathbf{u}_i + \\zeta \\sum_{i=1}^{4} N_i(\\xi, \\eta) \\frac{h_i}{2} \\boldsymbol{\\theta}_i $$\n    where $\\mathbf{u}_i$ are nodal translations and $\\boldsymbol{\\theta}_i$ are nodal rotations. The shape functions $N_i(\\xi, \\eta)$ are bilinear.\n    Bending strains are related to the curvatures $\\boldsymbol{\\kappa}$, which are spatial derivatives of the rotation field $\\boldsymbol{\\theta}(\\xi, \\eta) = \\sum N_i(\\xi, \\eta) \\boldsymbol{\\theta}_i$. For example, $\\kappa_x \\propto \\frac{\\partial \\theta_y}{\\partial x}$. The relationship between physical and parametric derivatives is $\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\mathbf{x}} = J^{-1} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\boldsymbol{\\xi}}$. Since $J$ is constant, $J^{-1}$ is also a constant matrix.\n    $$ \\frac{\\partial \\theta_y}{\\partial x} = (J^{-1})_{11} \\frac{\\partial \\theta_y}{\\partial \\xi} + (J^{-1})_{12} \\frac{\\partial \\theta_y}{\\partial \\eta} $$\n    Since $\\theta_y(\\xi, \\eta)$ is bilinear (e.g., $c_0 + c_1\\xi + c_2\\eta + c_3\\xi\\eta$), its derivatives $\\frac{\\partial \\theta_y}{\\partial \\xi}$ and $\\frac{\\partial \\theta_y}{\\partial \\eta}$ are linear functions of $\\eta$ and $\\xi$, respectively. As $(J^{-1})_{ij}$ are constants, the curvatures $\\boldsymbol{\\kappa}(\\xi, \\eta)$ are linear polynomials in $\\xi$ and $\\eta$.\n    The strain components related to bending are of the form $\\boldsymbol{\\epsilon}_b = \\zeta \\boldsymbol{\\kappa}(\\xi, \\eta)$. Thus, the bending strains are linear in $\\zeta$ and linear in $(\\xi, \\eta)$.\n    The bending part of the strain-displacement matrix, $B_b$, contains entries that are linear in $\\zeta$ and linear in $(\\xi, \\eta)$.\n\n3.  **Analysis of the Integrand $I(\\xi, \\eta, \\zeta)$:**\n    The integrand for the bending stiffness is $I_b = B_b^\\top C B_b \\det(J)$.\n    -   $B_b$: Entries are linear in $\\zeta$ and linear in $\\xi$ and $\\eta$.\n    -   $C$: Constant matrix.\n    -   $\\det(J)$: Constant.\n    The product $B_b^\\top C B_b$ will result in a matrix where each element is a sum of products of two entries from $B_b$. The polynomial degree of each term in the integrand is:\n    -   **In $\\zeta$:** $(\\text{linear in } \\zeta) \\times (\\text{linear in } \\zeta) = (\\zeta^1) \\times (\\zeta^1) = \\zeta^2$. The degree is $d_\\zeta = 2$.\n    -   **In $\\xi$ and $\\eta$:** $(\\text{linear in } \\xi, \\eta) \\times (\\text{linear in } \\xi, \\eta)$. For example, $(c_1 \\xi + \\dots) \\times (d_1 \\xi + \\dots) = c_1 d_1 \\xi^2 + \\dots$. The maximum degree in each of the in-plane variables is $d_\\xi = 2$ and $d_\\eta = 2$.\n\n4.  **Determination of Quadrature Order:**\n    According to the provided rule, an $n$-point Gauss-Legendre quadrature integrates a polynomial of degree up to $2n-1$ exactly. We require $2n-1 \\ge d$.\n    -   **Thickness direction ($\\zeta$):** The degree is $d_\\zeta=2$. We need $2n_\\zeta - 1 \\ge 2$, which implies $2n_\\zeta \\ge 3$, so the smallest integer $n_\\zeta$ is $2$. A $2$-point rule is required.\n    -   **In-plane directions ($\\xi, \\eta$):** The degree in each variable is $d_\\xi=2$ and $d_\\eta=2$.\n        For $\\xi$, we need $2n_\\xi - 1 \\ge 2 \\implies n_\\xi = 2$.\n        For $\\eta$, we need $2n_\\eta - 1 \\ge 2 \\implies n_\\eta = 2$.\n    The smallest required tensor-product rule in-plane is therefore a $2 \\times 2$ grid of points.\n\n**Conclusion:** The smallest Gauss-Legendre quadrature scheme that guarantees exact integration of the bending stiffness for this element under the given conditions is a $2 \\times 2$ rule in the $(\\xi, \\eta)$ plane and a $2$-point rule in the $\\zeta$ direction.\n\n**Option-by-Option Analysis**\n\n-   **A. In-plane: $1\\times 1$; thickness: $2$ points:** The thickness rule is sufficient. However, a $1 \\times 1$ in-plane rule can only integrate polynomials up to degree $2(1)-1=1$ exactly. The integrand is quadratic (degree $2$) in $\\xi$ and $\\eta$. Therefore, this rule is insufficient for exact in-plane integration. **Incorrect**.\n\n-   **B. In-plane: $2\\times 2$; thickness: $2$ points:** The thickness rule requires $n_\\zeta=2$ points, which is correct. The in-plane rule requires $n_\\xi=2$ and $n_\\eta=2$ points, which corresponds to a $2 \\times 2$ grid. This rule is both sufficient and minimal. **Correct**.\n\n-   **C. In-plane: $2\\times 2$; thickness: $1$ point:** The in-plane rule is sufficient. However, a $1$-point thickness rule can only integrate polynomials up to degree $2(1)-1=1$ exactly. The integrand is quadratic (degree $2$) in $\\zeta$. Therefore, this rule is insufficient. **Incorrect**.\n\n-   **D. In-plane: $3\\times 3$; thickness: $2$ points:** The thickness rule is sufficient. A $3 \\times 3$ in-plane rule integrates polynomials up to degree $2(3)-1=5$. This is sufficient, but the question asks for the *smallest* order. Since a $2 \\times 2$ rule is sufficient, this option is not the minimal choice. **Incorrect**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2596067"}]}
