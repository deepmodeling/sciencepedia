I will proceed with the detailed derivation and analysis of the options.\n\n### Derivation from First Principles\nThe patch test is a fundamental requirement for finite element formulations to ensure convergence. It verifies that the element formulation can exactly reproduce a state of constant strain when the boundary nodes of a patch of elements are subjected to displacements corresponding to that constant strain field.\n\n**Case 1: Constant Bending Curvatures $\\boldsymbol{\\kappa}^\\star$ and Zero Shear Strains**\n\nFor this state, we require $\\boldsymbol{\\gamma} = \\mathbf{0}$ and $\\boldsymbol{\\kappa} = \\boldsymbol{\\kappa}^\\star$.\nThe condition $\\boldsymbol{\\gamma} = \\mathbf{0}$ implies:\n$$\n\\begin{cases}\n\\gamma_{xz} = \\beta_x - w_{,x} = 0 \\implies \\beta_x = w_{,x} \\\\\n\\gamma_{yz} = \\beta_y - w_{,y} = 0 \\implies \\beta_y = w_{,y}\n\\end{cases}\n$$\nThis is the kinematic assumption of Kirchhoff-Love plate theory, which is a limiting case of Mindlin-Reissner theory for thin plates with zero shear deformation. Substituting these into the curvature definition:\n$$\n\\begin{cases}\n\\kappa_x = \\beta_{x,x} = w_{,xx} = \\kappa_x^\\star \\\\\n\\kappa_y = \\beta_{y,y} = w_{,yy} = \\kappa_y^\\star \\\\\n\\kappa_{xy} = \\beta_{x,y} + \\beta_{y,x} = w_{,xy} + w_{,yx} = 2 w_{,xy} = \\kappa_{xy}^\\star\n\\end{cases}\n$$\nThese are three partial differential equations for $w(x,y)$ with constant right-hand sides. To find the form of $w(x,y)$, we integrate. The general solution must be a quadratic polynomial in $x$ and $y$. Let us integrate $w_{,xx} = \\kappa_x^\\star$ twice with respect to $x$:\n$w(x,y) = \\frac{1}{2}\\kappa_x^\\star x^2 + x f_1(y) + f_2(y)$.\nDifferentiating with respect to $y$:\n$w_{,yy} = x f_1''(y) + f_2''(y) = \\kappa_y^\\star$. For this to hold for all $x$, we must have $f_1''(y) = 0$, which implies $f_1(y)$ is linear, say $f_1(y) = C_1 y + C_2$. Then $f_2''(y) = \\kappa_y^\\star$, which gives $f_2(y) = \\frac{1}{2}\\kappa_y^\\star y^2 + C_3 y + C_4$.\nSo, $w(x,y) = \\frac{1}{2}\\kappa_x^\\star x^2 + x(C_1 y + C_2) + \\frac{1}{2}\\kappa_y^\\star y^2 + C_3 y + C_4$.\nNow, we enforce the final condition: $2w_{,xy} = \\kappa_{xy}^\\star$.\n$w_{,x} = \\kappa_x^\\star x + C_1 y + C_2$.\n$w_{,xy} = C_1$. So $2C_1 = \\kappa_{xy}^\\star$, which means $C_1 = \\frac{1}{2}\\kappa_{xy}^\\star$.\nThe required displacement field is therefore:\n$$w(x,y) = \\frac{1}{2}\\kappa_x^\\star x^2 + \\frac{1}{2}\\kappa_y^\\star y^2 + \\frac{1}{2}\\kappa_{xy}^\\star xy + C_2 x + C_3 y + C_4$$\nThe terms $C_2 x + C_3 y + C_4$ represent arbitrary rigid body motion. The corresponding rotation fields are:\n$$\n\\beta_x(x,y) = w_{,x} = \\kappa_x^\\star x + \\frac{1}{2}\\kappa_{xy}^\\star y + C_2 \\\\\n\\beta_y(x,y) = w_{,y} = \\kappa_y^\\star y + \\frac{1}{2}\\kappa_{xy}^\\star x + C_3\n$$\nTo perform the patch test, these analytical functions for $w$, $\\beta_x$, and $\\beta_y$ are evaluated at the boundary nodes and imposed as essential boundary conditions. A valid element formulation must then recover these fields exactly at the interior nodes and reproduce the constant strains $\\boldsymbol{\\kappa}^\\star$ and $\\boldsymbol{\\gamma}=\\mathbf{0}$ throughout the patch. This implies that the nodal forces at all interior nodes must be zero.\n\n**Case 2: Constant Transverse Shear Strains $\\boldsymbol{\\gamma}^\\star$ and Zero Bending Curvatures**\n\nFor this state, we require $\\boldsymbol{\\kappa} = \\mathbf{0}$ and $\\boldsymbol{\\gamma} = \\boldsymbol{\\gamma}^\\star$.\nThe condition $\\boldsymbol{\\kappa} = \\mathbf{0}$ implies:\n$$\n\\beta_{x,x} = 0, \\quad \\beta_{y,y} = 0, \\quad \\beta_{x,y} + \\beta_{y,x} = 0\n$$\nFrom the first two equations, $\\beta_x$ can only be a function of $y$, and $\\beta_y$ can only be a function of $x$. So $\\beta_x(y)$ and $\\beta_y(x)$. The third equation becomes $\\frac{d\\beta_x}{dy} + \\frac{d\\beta_y}{dx} = 0$. This is possible only if both derivatives are constant, say $\\frac{d\\beta_x}{dy} = -C$ and $\\frac{d\\beta_y}{dx} = C$.\nIntegration yields $\\beta_x(y) = -Cy + C_1$ and $\\beta_y(x) = Cx + C_2$. These represent a rigid body rotation.\nNow, consider the shear strain conditions:\n$$\n\\begin{cases}\n\\gamma_{xz} = \\beta_x - w_{,x} = \\gamma_{xz}^\\star \\\\\n\\gamma_{yz} = \\beta_y - w_{,y} = \\gamma_{yz}^\\star\n\\end{cases}\n$$\nSubstituting the expressions for $\\beta_x$ and $\\beta_y$:\n$$\nw_{,x} = \\beta_x - \\gamma_{xz}^\\star = (-Cy + C_1) - \\gamma_{xz}^\\star \\\\\nw_{,y} = \\beta_y - \\gamma_{yz}^\\star = (Cx + C_2) - \\gamma_{yz}^\\star\n$$\nFor a displacement field $w(x,y)$ to exist, its mixed partial derivatives must be equal: $w_{,xy} = w_{,yx}$.\n$w_{,xy} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y} (-Cy + C_1 - \\gamma_{xz}^\\star) = -C$.\n$w_{,yx} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} (Cx + C_2 - \\gamma_{yz}^\\star) = C$.\nEquality requires $-C = C$, which implies $C=0$. Therefore, to achieve a state of zero curvature and constant shear strains, the rotation field $\\boldsymbol{\\beta}$ cannot have any spatial variation. It must be constant.\nLet $\\beta_x(x,y) = b_1$ and $\\beta_y(x,y) = b_2$. This immediately ensures $\\boldsymbol{\\kappa}=\\mathbf{0}$.\nThe shear strain equations become:\n$$\nw_{,x} = b_1 - \\gamma_{xz}^\\star = a_1 \\text{ (constant)} \\\\\nw_{,y} = b_2 - \\gamma_{yz}^\\star = a_2 \\text{ (constant)}\n$$\nIntegrating these gives a linear displacement field:\n$$w(x,y) = a_1 x + a_2 y + c_0$$\nThe terms $a_1 x + a_2 y + c_0$ represent rigid body motion. The required rotation fields are thus:\n$$\n\\beta_x(x,y) = a_1 + \\gamma_{xz}^\\star \\\\\n\\beta_y(x,y) = a_2 + \\gamma_{yz}^\\star\n$$\nTo perform this test, one prescribes the linear $w$ and constant $\\beta_x, \\beta_y$ on the boundary. A valid element must recover these fields exactly and reproduce the constant strains $\\boldsymbol{\\gamma}^\\star$ and $\\boldsymbol{\\kappa}=\\mathbf{0}$ everywhere, with zero interior nodal forces.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. For the constant-curvature test, pick constants $\\kappa_x^\\star$, $\\kappa_y^\\star$, $\\kappa_{xy}^\\star$ and define $w(x,y) = c_0 + a_0 x + b_0 y + \\tfrac{1}{2}\\kappa_x^\\star x^2 + \\tfrac{1}{2}\\kappa_y^\\star y^2 + \\tfrac{1}{2}\\kappa_{xy}^\\star x y$, $\\beta_x(x,y) = \\partial w/\\partial x$, $\\beta_y(x,y) = \\partial w/\\partial y$. Impose these $w$ and $\\boldsymbol{\\beta}$ as essential boundary conditions on all boundary nodes; apply no tractions. The element passes if, upon solution, interior nodal residual forces are exactly zero to machine precision, the computed curvatures are uniform and equal to $\\boldsymbol{\\kappa}^\\star$, the computed shear strains are identically zero, and the boundary reaction resultants are consistent with $\\mathbf{D}_b \\boldsymbol{\\kappa}^\\star$ integrated along the boundary.**\n\nThe prescribed field for $w(x,y)$ is the correct quadratic polynomial for constant bending curvature. The condition $\\boldsymbol{\\beta} = \\nabla w$ correctly enforces the zero shear strain condition $\\boldsymbol{\\gamma}=\\mathbf{0}$. My derivation confirms these are the correct fields. The passing criteria listed—zero interior nodal forces, exact reproduction of constant curvatures $\\boldsymbol{\\kappa}^\\star$, and zero shear strains—are the definitive requirements of the patch test. The check on boundary reactions is a verification of overall equilibrium. This statement is entirely correct.\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\n**B. For the constant-shear test, pick constants $\\gamma_{xz}^\\star$, $\\gamma_{yz}^\\star$ and define $w(x,y) = c_0 + a_1 x + a_2 y$, $\\beta_x(x,y) = \\partial w/\\partial x$, $\\beta_y(x,y) = \\partial w/\\partial y$. Impose these as boundary essential conditions; apply no tractions. The element passes if the average shear strain over the patch equals $0.5(\\gamma_{xz}^\\star+\\gamma_{yz}^\\star)$, regardless of pointwise values.**\n\nThe prescribed fields are $w(x,y) = c_0 + a_1 x + a_2 y$, which implies $w_{,x}=a_1$ and $w_{,y}=a_2$. The rotations are defined as $\\beta_x = w_{,x} = a_1$ and $\\beta_y = w_{,y} = a_2$. Let us compute the strains:\n$\\boldsymbol{\\kappa} = \\mathbf{0}$ because the rotations are constant.\n$\\gamma_{xz} = \\beta_x - w_{,x} = a_1 - a_1 = 0$.\n$\\gamma_{yz} = \\beta_y - w_{,y} = a_2 - a_2 = 0$.\nThese fields correspond to a state of zero strain (rigid body motion), not a state of constant non-zero shear strain. The test is trivial and does not check for the desired capability. Furthermore, the passing criterion involving an *average* strain and a tolerance is fundamentally inconsistent with the principle of the patch test, which demands *exact, pointwise* reproduction of the target state.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**C. For the constant-shear test, pick constants $\\gamma_{xz}^\\star$, $\\gamma_{yz}^\\star$ and define $w(x,y) = c_0 + a_1 x + a_2 y$, $\\beta_x(x,y) = a_1 + \\gamma_{xz}^\\star$, $\\beta_y(x,y) = a_2 + \\gamma_{yz}^\\star$. Impose these $w$ and $\\boldsymbol{\\beta}$ as essential boundary conditions; apply no tractions. The element passes if, upon solution, interior nodal residual forces are exactly zero to machine precision, the computed shear strains are uniform and equal to $\\boldsymbol{\\gamma}^\\star$, the computed curvatures are identically zero, and the boundary reaction resultants are consistent with $\\mathbf{D}_s \\boldsymbol{\\gamma}^\\star$ integrated along the boundary.**\n\nThe prescribed field for $w(x,y)$ is linear, and the fields for $\\beta_x$ and $\\beta_y$ are constant, as derived from first principles. Let's verify the strains:\n$w_{,x} = a_1$, $w_{,y} = a_2$.\n$\\boldsymbol{\\kappa} = \\mathbf{0}$ since $\\boldsymbol{\\beta}$ is constant.\n$\\gamma_{xz} = \\beta_x - w_{,x} = (a_1 + \\gamma_{xz}^\\star) - a_1 = \\gamma_{xz}^\\star$.\n$\\gamma_{yz} = \\beta_y - w_{,y} = (a_2 + \\gamma_{yz}^\\star) - a_2 = \\gamma_{yz}^\\star$.\nThe fields correctly produce the desired state of constant shear strain $\\boldsymbol{\\gamma}^\\star$ and zero curvature. The passing criteria—zero interior nodal forces, exact reproduction of constant shear strains $\\boldsymbol{\\gamma}^\\star$, and zero curvatures—are the correct requirements. This statement is entirely correct.\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\n**D. For the constant-curvature test, it is sufficient to impose uniform rotations $\\beta_x = \\beta_y = c$ on the boundary and set $w(x,y)$ to a quadratic polynomial whose gradient does not necessarily match $\\boldsymbol{\\beta}$; the element passes if the average curvature over the patch equals $\\boldsymbol{\\kappa}^\\star$ within a small tolerance.**\n\nImposing uniform rotations $\\beta_x = \\beta_y = c$ means $\\boldsymbol{\\kappa} = \\mathbf{0}$. This cannot be a test for constant non-zero curvature. The premise is self-contradictory. Additionally, the passing criterion based on an average value \"within a small tolerance\" is the definition of a convergence check, not a patch test, which requires exactness.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**E. A valid patch test can be conducted by prescribing only nodal point forces on the boundary such that the sum of nodal moments equals the target bending moment resultants; the element passes if the solved nodal displacements are approximately quadratic and linear for $w$ and $\\boldsymbol{\\beta}$, respectively, within an arbitrary tolerance that decreases with mesh refinement.**\n\nThe problem explicitly requires the test to be designed \"by prescribing only essential boundary conditions\". This option proposes prescribing forces (natural boundary conditions), which violates the problem specification. Furthermore, the passing criteria described—approximate solution and tolerance decreasing with mesh refinement—define convergence, not a patch test. The patch test is a check for consistency on a fixed, coarse mesh, and it must pass exactly (to machine precision). This option fundamentally misunderstands the patch test.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\nIn summary, options A and C correctly describe the setup and passing criteria for the constant-curvature and constant-shear patch tests, respectively, based on the first principles of Mindlin-Reissner plate theory.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{AC}$$", "id": "2558458"}]}
