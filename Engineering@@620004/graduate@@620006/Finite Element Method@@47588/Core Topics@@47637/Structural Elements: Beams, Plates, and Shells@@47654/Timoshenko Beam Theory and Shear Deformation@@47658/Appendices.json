All principles are fundamental to solid mechanics.\n- **Well-Posed:** The problem provides a system of differential equations and a sufficient number of boundary conditions ($4$ conditions for a system that can be reduced to a fourth-order ODE) to determine a unique solution for the two unknowns, $w(x)$ and $\\phi(x)$.\n- **Objective:** The problem is stated using precise, standard terminology from engineering and mathematics.\n- **Conclusion:** The problem is scientifically sound, self-contained, consistent, and well-posed.

Equilibrium Equations\n    Balance of forces on a differential element of length $dx$ yields $\\frac{dV}{dx} = -q_0$.\n    Balance of moments yields $\\frac{dM}{dx} = V$.\n    Combining these two equations, we obtain $\\frac{d^2M}{dx^2} = -q_0$.\n\n2.  Constitutive and Kinematic Relations\n    - The bending moment $M$ is related to the curvature $\\frac{d\\phi}{dx}$. For our sign conventions (positive sagging moment $M$, positive counterclockwise rotation $\\phi$), a positive moment causes the beam to sag, meaning $\\phi$ decreases as $x$ increases. Therefore, $\\frac{d\\phi}{dx}$ is negative, and the constitutive relation is $M = -EI \\frac{d\\phi}{dx}$.\n    - The shear force $V$ is related to the shear strain $\\gamma$ by $V = \\kappa A G \\gamma$, where $\\kappa$ is the shear correction factor.\n    - The Timoshenko kinematic relation connects the slope of the deflection curve $\\frac{dw}{dx}$, the cross-section rotation $\\phi$, and the shear strain $\\gamma$. For our sign conventions, the shear strain is the difference between the slope of the deflection curve and the rotation of the cross-section: $\\gamma = \\frac{dw}{dx} - \\phi$.\n    - Substituting $\\gamma$ into the shear force relation gives $V = \\kappa A G (\\frac{dw}{dx} - \\phi)$.\n\n3.  Derivation of Shear Force $V(x)$ and Bending Moment $M(x)$\n    We first solve for $V(x)$ and $M(x)$ using the equilibrium equations and boundary conditions.\n    Integrating $\\frac{dV}{dx} = -q_0$ gives:\n    $V(x) = -q_0 x + C_1$\n    Integrating $\\frac{dM}{dx} = V$ gives:\n    $M(x) = \\int (-q_0 x + C_1) dx = -\\frac{q_0 x^2}{2} + C_1 x + C_2$\n    Now, we apply the boundary conditions for the bending moment.\n    $M(0) = 0 \\implies -\\frac{q_0 (0)^2}{2} + C_1(0) + C_2 = 0 \\implies C_2 = 0$.\n    $M(L) = 0 \\implies -\\frac{q_0 L^2}{2} + C_1 L = 0 \\implies C_1 = \\frac{q_0 L}{2}$.\n    Thus, the shear force and bending moment are:\n    $V(x) = q_0(\\frac{L}{2} - x)$\n    $M(x) = \\frac{q_0 L x}{2} - \\frac{q_0 x^2}{2} = \\frac{q_0 x}{2}(L - x)$\n\n4.  Derivation of Cross-Section Rotation $\\phi(x)$\n    We use the constitutive relation $M = -EI \\frac{d\\phi}{dx}$:\n    $\\frac{d\\phi}{dx} = -\\frac{M(x)}{EI} = -\\frac{1}{EI} \\left( \\frac{q_0 L x}{2} - \\frac{q_0 x^2}{2} \\right) = \\frac{q_0}{2EI} (x^2 - Lx)$\n    Integrating with respect to $x$:\n    $\\phi(x) = \\int \\frac{q_0}{2EI} (x^2 - Lx) dx = \\frac{q_0}{2EI} \\left( \\frac{x^3}{3} - \\frac{Lx^2}{2} \\right) + C_3$\n    Due to the symmetry of the loading and boundary conditions, the cross-section rotation must be zero at the mid-span, $x = L/2$.

Full integration penalizes both the constant ($\\gamma_{0}$) and linear ($\\gamma_{1}$) components of this parasitic shear strain. In the slender limit, the true shear strain should be nearly zero, but the element kinematics impose a non-zero strain, resulting in an artificially high shear energy and an overly stiff response. Reduced integration evaluates the shear energy only at the element center ($\\xi=0$). This procedure correctly penalizes the constant part of the shear strain, $\\gamma_0$, but completely ignores the linear part, $\\gamma_1$, as its contribution to the energy becomes $\\frac{1}{2}\\kappa G A L (0)^2 = 0$. This relaxation of the shear constraint allows the element to bend more freely without a large energy penalty, thus eliminating shear locking.\n\nHowever, this introduces a problem. Any deformation mode for which $\\gamma_{0}=0$ but $\\gamma_{1}\\neq 0$ will yield zero shear strain energy under reduced integration ($U_{\\mathrm{shear}}^{\\mathrm{RI}}=0$). Such a deformation is not a rigid-body motion and should possess strain energy. For example, a state where $w_1 = w_2 = 0$ and $\\phi_1 = -\\phi_2 \\neq 0$ gives $\\gamma_0 = 0$ and $\\gamma_1 = \\phi_1 \\neq 0$.

It is a scientifically sound, well-posed, and complete problem from the field of computational mechanics. A solution will be provided.\n\nThe analysis proceeds by first deriving the expression for the assumed shear strain $\\tilde{\\gamma}_{xz}$ and then applying the shear patch test.\n\nThe displacement $w(x)$ and rotation $\\theta(x)$ fields are interpolated over a $2$-node element using linear shape functions $N_1(\\xi)$ and $N_2(\\xi)$, where $\\xi \\in [-1, 1]$ is the parent coordinate. The shape functions are:\n$$\nN_1(\\xi) = \\frac{1-\\xi}{2} \\quad , \\quad N_2(\\xi) = \\frac{1+\\xi}{2}\n$$\nThe interpolated fields, denoted $w^h$ and $\\theta^h$, are given in terms of the nodal DOFs $(w_1, \\theta_1)$ at node $1$ ($\\xi=-1$) and $(w_2, \\theta_2)$ at node $2$ ($\\xi=1$):\n$$\nw^h(\\xi) = N_1(\\xi)w_1 + N_2(\\xi)w_2 = \\frac{1-\\xi}{2}w_1 + \\frac{1+\\xi}{2}w_2 \\\\\n\\theta^h(\\xi) = N_1(\\xi)\\theta_1 + N_2(\\xi)\\theta_2 = \\frac{1-\\xi}{2}\\theta_1 + \\frac{1+\\xi}{2}\\theta_2\n$$\nThe discrete shear strain, $\\gamma_{xz}^h$, is defined as $\\gamma_{xz}^h = \\frac{dw^h}{dx} - \\theta^h$. To compute the derivative $\\frac{dw^h}{dx}$, we use the chain rule and the given isoparametric mapping $x(\\xi) = \\frac{L}{2}(1+\\xi)$. The Jacobian of the transformation is $J = \\frac{dx}{d\\xi} = \\frac{L}{2}$.\n$$\n\\frac{dw^h}{dx} = \\frac{dw^h}{d\\xi}\\frac{d\\xi}{dx} = \\frac{dw^h}{d\\xi} \\left(\\frac{1}{J}\\right)\n$$\nThe derivative of $w^h$ with respect to $\\xi$ is:\n$$\n\\frac{dw^h}{d\\xi} = \\frac{d}{d\\xi}\\left(\\frac{1-\\xi}{2}w_1 + \\frac{1+\\xi}{2}w_2\\right) = -\\frac{1}{2}w_1 + \\frac{1}{2}w_2 = \\frac{w_2-w_1}{2}\n$$\nTherefore, the derivative $\\frac{dw^h}{dx}$ is:\n$$\n\\frac{dw^h}{dx} = \\left(\\frac{w_2-w_1}{2}\\right) \\left(\\frac{2}{L}\\right) = \\frac{w_2-w_1}{L}\n$$\nThe discrete shear strain $\\gamma_{xz}^h$ as a function of $\\xi$ is:\n$$\n\\gamma_{xz}^h(\\xi) = \\frac{w_2-w_1}{L} - \\theta^h(\\xi) = \\frac{w_2-w_1}{L} - \\left(\\frac{1-\\xi}{2}\\theta_1 + \\frac{1+\\xi}{2}\\theta_2\\right)\n$$\nThe problem requires us to find a constant assumed shear strain $\\tilde{\\gamma}_{xz}$ that is the $L^2$ projection of $\\gamma_{xz}^h(x)$ onto the space of constant functions, $\\mathbb{P}_0$. This is achieved by minimizing the functional $F(\\tilde{\\gamma}_{xz}) = \\int_{0}^{L}(\\tilde{\\gamma}_{xz} - \\gamma_{xz}^h(x))^2 dx$. The necessary condition for a minimum is $\\frac{dF}{d\\tilde{\\gamma}_{xz}} = 0$:\n$$\n\\frac{dF}{d\\tilde{\\gamma}_{xz}} = \\int_{0}^{L} 2(\\tilde{\\gamma}_{xz} - \\gamma_{xz}^h(x)) dx = 0 \\implies \\tilde{\\gamma}_{xz} \\int_{0}^{L} dx = \\int_{0}^{L} \\gamma_{xz}^h(x) dx\n$$\nThis yields the expression for $\\tilde{\\gamma}_{xz}$ as the average value of $\\gamma_{xz}^h(x)$ over the element length $L$:\n$$\n\\tilde{\\gamma}_{xz} = \\frac{1}{L} \\int_{0}^{L} \\gamma_{xz}^h(x) dx\n$$\nWe evaluate this integral in the parent coordinate system using $dx = J d\\xi = \\frac{L}{2} d\\xi$:\n$$\n\\tilde{\\gamma}_{xz} = \\frac{1}{L} \\int_{-1}^{1} \\gamma_{xz}^h(\\xi) \\left(\\frac{L}{2}\\right) d\\xi = \\frac{1}{2} \\int_{-1}^{1} \\gamma_{xz}^h(\\xi) d\\xi\n$$\nSubstituting the expression for $\\gamma_{xz}^h(\\xi)$:\n$$\n\\tilde{\\gamma}_{xz} = \\frac{1}{2} \\int_{-1}^{1} \\left[ \\frac{w_2-w_1}{L} - \\left(\\frac{1-\\xi}{2}\\theta_1 + \\frac{1+\\xi}{2}\\theta_2\\right) \\right] d\\xi\n$$\nWe integrate term by term. The first term is constant with respect to $\\xi$:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{2} \\int_{-1}^{1} \\frac{w_2-w_1}{L} d\\xi = \\frac{1}{2} \\frac{w_2-w_1}{L} [\\xi]_{-1}^{1} = \\frac{1}{2} \\frac{w_2-w_1}{L} (2) = \\frac{w_2-w_1}{L}\n$$\nFor the rotation terms, we use the fact that $\\int_{-1}^{1} N_1(\\xi) d\\xi = 1$ and $\\int_{-1}^{1} N_2(\\xi) d\\xi = 1$:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{2} \\int_{-1}^{1} \\left(\\frac{1-\\xi}{2}\\theta_1 + \\frac{1+\\xi}{2}\\theta_2\\right) d\\xi = \\frac{1}{2} \\left( \\theta_1 \\int_{-1}^{1} N_1(\\xi)d\\xi + \\theta_2 \\int_{-1}^{1} N_2(\\xi)d\\xi \\right) = \\frac{1}{2}(\\theta_1 + \\theta_2)\n$$\nCombining these results gives the explicit formula for the assumed shear strain:\n$$\n\\tilde{\\gamma}_{xz} = \\frac{w_2-w_1}{L} - \\frac{\\theta_1+\\theta_2}{2}\n$$\nThis completes the first part of the problem.\n\nNext, we perform the shear patch test. The test requires that for a state of constant shear strain, the element formulation must reproduce this strain exactly. Let the exact, constant shear strain be $\\gamma_{xz}(x) = \\gamma_0$. In a state of pure shear, the bending moment $m(x)$ is zero, which implies the curvature $\\kappa(x) = \\frac{d\\theta}{dx} = 0$. This means the rotation $\\theta(x)$ must be a constant, say $\\theta(x) = \\theta_c$.\nFrom the Timoshenko kinematic relation for shear strain:\n$$\n\\frac{dw}{dx} - \\theta(x) = \\gamma_0 \\implies \\frac{dw}{dx} = \\gamma_0 + \\theta_c\n$$\nIntegrating this equation gives the exact transverse displacement field:\n$$\nw(x) = (\\gamma_0 + \\theta_c)x + w_{\\text{ref}}\n$$\nwhere $w_{\\text{ref}}$ is a constant of integration representing rigid-body translation.\nNow, we evaluate the nodal DOFs at the element nodes, located at $x_1=0$ and $x_2=L$:\n$$\nw_1 = w(0) = w_{\\text{ref}} \\\\\n\\theta_1 = \\theta(0) = \\theta_c \\\\\nw_2 = w(L) = (\\gamma_0 + \\theta_c)L + w_{\\text{ref}} \\\\\n\\theta_2 = \\theta(L) = \\theta_c\n$$\nFor the element to pass the patch test, substituting these nodal values into the derived formula for $\\tilde{\\gamma}_{xz}$ must yield $\\gamma_0$.\nLet's perform this substitution:\n$$\n\\tilde{\\gamma}_{xz} = \\frac{w_2-w_1}{L} - \\frac{\\theta_1+\\theta_2}{2} = \\frac{((\\gamma_0 + \\theta_c)L + w_{\\text{ref}}) - w_{\\text{ref}}}{L} - \\frac{\\theta_c+\\theta_c}{2}\n$$\n$$\n\\tilde{\\gamma}_{xz} = \\frac{(\\gamma_0 + \\theta_c)L}{L} - \\frac{2\\theta_c}{2} = (\\gamma_0 + \\theta_c) - \\theta_c = \\gamma_0\n$$\nSince $\\tilde{\\gamma}_{xz} = \\gamma_0$, the calculated constant shear strain from the MITC element formulation exactly matches the imposed constant shear strain. Therefore, the element passes the shear patch test. This is an expected result for an MITC element where the assumed field (here, a constant) is chosen from a space that can exactly represent the target strain field (also a constant).\n\nFinally, we are asked to compute the ratio $r = \\frac{\\tilde{\\gamma}_{xz}}{\\gamma_0}$ under the patch test conditions.\nBased on the foregoing derivation, we have:\n$$\nr = \\frac{\\gamma_0}{\\gamma_0} = 1\n$$\nThe value is an exact dimensionless number.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{1}$$", "id": "2606088"}]}
