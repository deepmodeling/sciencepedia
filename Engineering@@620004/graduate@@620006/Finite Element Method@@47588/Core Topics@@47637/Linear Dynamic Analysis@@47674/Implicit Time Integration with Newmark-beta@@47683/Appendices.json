It is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and contains all necessary information for a complete solution. The problem is deemed valid and will be solved as stated.\n\nThe problem consists of two tasks. Task A requires the derivation of the initial acceleration for a system governed by a second-order ordinary differential equation. Task B requires an analysis of the consistency and order of accuracy for the Newmark-$\\beta$ time integration method.\n\n**Task A: Derivation of Initial Acceleration**\n\nWe begin with the semi-discrete equation of motion for a linear structural system:\n$$\nM \\,\\ddot{u}(t) + C \\,\\dot{u}(t) + K \\,u(t) = f(t)\n$$\nHere, $M$, $C$, and $K$ represent the mass, damping, and stiffness matrices, respectively. The vectors $u(t)$, $\\dot{u}(t)$, $\\ddot{u}(t)$, and $f(t)$ represent the time-dependent displacement, velocity, acceleration, and external force.\n\nThe problem requires the determination of the initial acceleration, denoted as $a_0$, which is defined as the acceleration at the initial time $t_0$:\n$$\na_0 := \\ddot{u}(t_0)\n$$\nTo find an expression for $a_0$, we evaluate the governing equation of motion at the specific instant in time $t=t_0$:\n$$\nM \\,\\ddot{u}(t_0) + C \\,\\dot{u}(t_0) + K \\,u(t_0) = f(t_0)\n$$\nThe problem provides the initial conditions for displacement and velocity:\n$$\nu(t_0) = u_0 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\dot{u}(t_0) = v_0\n$$\nSubstituting these initial conditions and the definition of $a_0$ into the equation of motion at $t_0$, we obtain:\n$$\nM \\,a_0 + C \\,v_0 + K \\,u_0 = f(t_0)\n$$\nOur objective is to solve this linear algebraic system for the unknown vector $a_0$. To isolate the term $M \\,a_0$, we rearrange the equation:\n$$\nM \\,a_0 = f(t_0) - K \\,u_0 - C \\,v_0\n$$\nThe problem statement includes the essential assumption that the mass matrix $M$ is invertible. This is a standard and physically meaningful assumption for non-degenerate mechanical systems, as $M$ is symmetric and positive-definite. The invertibility of $M$ is the sole algebraic assumption required to obtain a unique solution for $a_0$.\n\nBy pre-multiplying both sides of the equation by the inverse of the mass matrix, $M^{-1}$, we arrive at the closed-form expression for the initial acceleration:\n$$\na_0 = M^{-1} (f(t_0) - C v_0 - K u_0)\n$$\nThis expression provides the initial acceleration vector consistent with the governing dynamics and the specified initial state $(u_0, v_0)$.\n\n**Task B: Consistency Analysis of the Newmark-$\\beta$ Method**\n\nThe Newmark-$\\beta$ method is defined by the update rules for displacement and velocity from time $t_n$ to $t_{n+1} = t_n + \\Delta t$:\n$$\nu_{n+1} = u_n + \\Delta t\\, v_n + \\Delta t^2\\left(\\tfrac{1}{2} - \\beta\\right) a_n + \\Delta t^2 \\beta \\, a_{n+1} \\quad (1)\n$$\n$$\nv_{n+1} = v_n + \\Delta t\\left(1 - \\gamma\\right)a_n + \\Delta t\\, \\gamma \\, a_{n+1} \\quad (2)\n$$\nTo determine the order of accuracy, we analyze the local truncation error, which is the error introduced in a single step assuming the solution at $t_n$ is exact. We let $u_n = u(t_n)$, $v_n = \\dot{u}(t_n)$, and $a_n = \\ddot{u}(t_n)$ represent the exact solution values. The local truncation error is found by comparing the numerically computed values $u_{n+1}$ and $v_{n+1}$ with the Taylor series expansions of the exact solution, $u(t_{n+1})$ and $\\dot{u}(t_{n+1})$, around $t_n$.\n\nThe Taylor series expansions for the exact solution and its derivatives are:\n$$\nu(t_{n+1}) = u(t_n) + \\Delta t\\, \\dot{u}(t_n) + \\frac{\\Delta t^2}{2} \\ddot{u}(t_n) + \\frac{\\Delta t^3}{6} \\dddot{u}(t_n) + O(\\Delta t^4)\n$$\n$$\n\\dot{u}(t_{n+1}) = \\dot{u}(t_n) + \\Delta t\\, \\ddot{u}(t_n) + \\frac{\\Delta t^2}{2} \\dddot{u}(t_n) + O(\\Delta t^3)\n$$\n$$\n\\ddot{u}(t_{n+1}) = \\ddot{u}(t_n) + \\Delta t\\, \\dddot{u}(t_n) + O(\\Delta t^2)\n$$\nWe substitute the expansion for $\\ddot{u}(t_{n+1})$ into the Newmark update equations, $(1)$ and $(2)$. For the displacement update:\n$$\nu_{n+1} = u_n + \\Delta t\\, v_n + \\Delta t^2\\left(\\tfrac{1}{2} - \\beta\\right) a_n + \\Delta t^2 \\beta \\left(a_n + \\Delta t\\, \\dddot{u}(t_n) + O(\\Delta t^2)\\right)\n$$\n$$\nu_{n+1} = u_n + \\Delta t\\, v_n + \\frac{\\Delta t^2}{2} a_n + \\beta \\Delta t^3 \\dddot{u}(t_n) + O(\\Delta t^4)\n$$\nThe local truncation error for displacement, $L_u = u_{n+1} - u(t_{n+1})$, is:\n$$\nL_u = \\left(\\beta - \\frac{1}{6}\\right) \\Delta t^3 \\dddot{u}(t_n) + O(\\Delta t^4)\n$$\nThis error is of order $O(\\Delta t^3)$ for any value of the parameter $\\beta$.\n\nNext, we analyze the velocity update:\n$$\nv_{n+1} = v_n + \\Delta t\\,(1 - \\gamma) a_n + \\Delta t\\, \\gamma \\left(a_n + \\Delta t\\, \\dddot{u}(t_n) + O(\\Delta t^2)\\right)\n$$\n$$\nv_{n+1} = v_n + \\Delta t\\, a_n + \\gamma \\Delta t^2 \\dddot{u}(t_n) + O(\\Delta t^3)\n$$\nThe local truncation error for velocity, $L_v = v_{n+1} - \\dot{u}(t_{n+1})$, is:\n$$\nL_v = \\left(\\gamma - \\frac{1}{2}\\right) \\Delta t^2 \\dddot{u}(t_n) + O(\\Delta t^3)\n$$\nFor a numerical method to be second-order accurate (i.e., its global error is $O(\\Delta t^2)$), its local truncation error must be $O(\\Delta t^3)$. The truncation error for velocity, $L_v$, has a leading term of order $O(\\Delta t^2)$. For $L_v$ to be of order $O(\\Delta t^3)$, the coefficient of the $\\Delta t^2$ term must be zero. This imposes a necessary condition on the parameter $\\gamma$:\n$$\n\\gamma - \\frac{1}{2} = 0 \\implies \\gamma = \\frac{1}{2}\n$$\nThus, $\\gamma$ must be fixed to $\\frac{1}{2}$ for the Newmark-$\\beta$ method to be second-order accurate. The parameter $\\beta$ does not affect the order of accuracy; its choice influences the magnitude of the truncation error (the constant factor) and, importantly, the numerical stability properties of the scheme, a topic beyond the scope of this problem.\n\nFinally, we must address the connection between the initialization of $a_0$ and the preservation of second-order accuracy. The local error analysis above presumes that the state $(u_n, v_n, a_n)$ at the beginning of each step is consistent, meaning $a_n = \\ddot{u}(t_n)$. This must hold for all steps, including the very first step from $t_0$ to $t_1$.\nAt the start of the simulation ($n=0$), we are given exact values for $u_0$ and $v_0$. To compute the state at $t_1$, the Newmark equations require the acceleration $a_0$. If an arbitrary or inconsistent value is chosen for $a_0$ (e.g., $a_0=0$), the assumption $a_0 = \\ddot{u}(t_0)$ is violated. This introduces an initial error. Specifically, the error in the velocity after one step, $v_1 - \\dot{u}(t_1)$, would contain a contribution of order $\\Delta t$ proportional to the initial error in acceleration $(a_0^{chosen} - a_0^{exact})$. An $O(\\Delta t)$ error at the first step compromises the global accuracy, degrading the method to first order.\nTo maintain the theoretical second-order accuracy of the scheme, it is imperative that the initial acceleration $a_0$ be computed such that it is consistent with the governing equation of motion at $t_0$. This requires satisfying the equation $M a_0 + C v_0 + K u_0 = f(t_0)$, which yields precisely the expression for $a_0$ derived in Task A. Proper initialization is therefore not a matter of convenience but a fundamental requirement for achieving the designed order of accuracy of the integration scheme.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{M^{-1} (f(t_0) - C v_0 - K u_0)}\n$$", "id": "2568067"}, {"introduction": "Beyond the order of accuracy, the choice of Newmark parameters introduces important numerical properties, such as artificial energy dissipation.
