We shall proceed by systematically analyzing the provided foundational facts. The solution is structured into three parts as requested.\n\nFirst, we derive the expression for the strain energy density, $w$, for the two-dimensional cases of plane stress and plane strain, starting from the three-dimensional constitutive law. The strain energy density is given by $w=\\frac{1}{2}\\sigma_{ij}\\varepsilon_{ij}$. For a two-dimensional problem in the $x_1-x_2$ plane, the stress components $\\sigma_{13}$ and $\\sigma_{23}$ are zero. Consequently, the corresponding shear strains $\\varepsilon_{13}$ and $\\varepsilon_{23}$ are also zero. The expression for $w$ thus simplifies to:\n$$\nw = \\frac{1}{2}(\\sigma_{11}\\varepsilon_{11} + \\sigma_{22}\\varepsilon_{22} + \\sigma_{33}\\varepsilon_{33} + 2\\sigma_{12}\\varepsilon_{12})\n$$\nThe provided isotropic linear elastic constitutive law is $\\varepsilon_{ij}=\\frac{1+\\nu}{E}\\sigma_{ij}-\\frac{\\nu}{E}\\sigma_{kk}\\delta_{ij}$, where $\\sigma_{kk} = \\sigma_{11} + \\sigma_{22} + \\sigma_{33}$.\n\nCase 1: Plane Stress ($\\sigma_{33}=0$)\n\nUnder the condition of plane stress, $\\sigma_{33}=0$. The trace of the stress tensor becomes $\\sigma_{kk} = \\sigma_{11} + \\sigma_{22}$. The in-plane strain components are then:\n$$\n\\varepsilon_{11} = \\frac{1+\\nu}{E}\\sigma_{11} - \\frac{\\nu}{E}(\\sigma_{11} + \\sigma_{22}) = \\frac{1}{E}(\\sigma_{11} - \\nu\\sigma_{22})\n$$\n$$\n\\varepsilon_{22} = \\frac{1+\\nu}{E}\\sigma_{22} - \\frac{\\nu}{E}(\\sigma_{11} + \\sigma_{22}) = \\frac{1}{E}(\\sigma_{22} - \\nu\\sigma_{11})\n$$\n$$\n\\varepsilon_{12} = \\frac{1+\\nu}{E}\\sigma_{12}\n$$\nSince $\\sigma_{33}=0$, the term $\\sigma_{33}\\varepsilon_{33}$ in the expression for $w$ vanishes.

From the constitutive law for the normal strain in the $x_3$ direction:\n$$\n\\varepsilon_{33} = \\frac{1+\\nu}{E}\\sigma_{33} - \\frac{\\nu}{E}(\\sigma_{11} + \\sigma_{22} + \\sigma_{33}) = 0\n$$\nSolving for $\\sigma_{33}$ provides the out-of-plane stress required to maintain the zero-strain condition:\n$$\n(1+\\nu)\\sigma_{33} - \\nu\\sigma_{33} = \\nu(\\sigma_{11} + \\sigma_{22}) \\implies \\sigma_{33} = \\nu(\\sigma_{11} + \\sigma_{22})\n$$\nThe trace of the stress tensor becomes $\\sigma_{kk} = \\sigma_{11} + \\sigma_{22} + \\nu(\\sigma_{11} + \\sigma_{22}) = (1+\\nu)(\\sigma_{11} + \\sigma_{22})$. The in-plane strain components are:\n$$\n\\varepsilon_{11} = \\frac{1}{E}[\\sigma_{11} - \\nu(\\sigma_{22} + \\sigma_{33})] = \\frac{1}{E}[\\sigma_{11} - \\nu\\sigma_{22} - \\nu^2(\\sigma_{11}+\\sigma_{22})] = \\frac{1}{E}[(1-\\nu^2)\\sigma_{11} - \\nu(1+\\nu)\\sigma_{22}]\n$$\n$$\n\\varepsilon_{22} = \\frac{1}{E}[\\sigma_{22} - \\nu(\\sigma_{11} + \\sigma_{33})] = \\frac{1}{E}[\\sigma_{22} - \\nu\\sigma_{11} - \\nu^2(\\sigma_{11}+\\sigma_{22})] = \\frac{1}{E}[(1-\\nu^2)\\sigma_{22} - \\nu(1+\\nu)\\sigma_{11}]\n$$\n$$\n\\varepsilon_{12} = \\frac{1+\\nu}{E}\\sigma_{12}\n$$\nSince $\\varepsilon_{33}=0$, the term $\\sigma_{33}\\varepsilon_{33}$ in the expression for $w$ vanishes.

The $J$-integral is obtained by evaluating the integral $J=\\int_{\\Gamma}(w\\,n_{1}-\\sigma_{ij}n_{j}u_{i,1})\\,\\mathrm{d}s$ using the near-tip fields. The stress field is given as $\\sigma_{ij} = \\frac{K_I}{\\sqrt{2\\pi r}} f_{ij}(\\theta)$, which is independent of elastic constants for a given $K_I$. The displacement field $u_i$ is obtained by integrating the strains $\\varepsilon_{ij}$, which depend linearly on the stresses through the compliance. Thus, both terms in the $J$-integral integrand, $w$ and $\\sigma_{ij}n_j u_{i,1}$, will scale quadratically with $K_I$ and linearly with the material compliance. This structural dependence implies $J$ is of the form $J = C K_I^2$, where the constant $C$ embodies the material properties. We define an effective modulus $E'$ such that $J = K_I^2/E'$.\n\nFor plane stress, the strains are $\\varepsilon_{ij} \\propto \\frac{1}{E}$. Consequently, the displacements $u_i \\propto \\frac{1}{E}$ and the strain energy density $w_{\\text{ps}} \\propto \\frac{1}{E}$. The entire $J$-integral expression must therefore be proportional to $\\frac{1}{E}$.\n$$\nJ_{\\text{ps}} \\propto \\frac{K_I^2}{E}\n$$\nBy comparing this with $J=K_I^2/E'$, the effective modulus for plane stress is identified as:\n$$\nE'_{\\text{ps}} = E\n$$\n\nFor plane strain, observe the in-plane stress-strain relations:\n$$\n\\varepsilon_{11} = \\frac{1-\\nu^2}{E}\\left(\\sigma_{11} - \\frac{\\nu}{1-\\nu}\\sigma_{22}\\right)\n$$\n$$\n\\varepsilon_{22} = \\frac{1-\\nu^2}{E}\\left(\\sigma_{22} - \\frac{\\nu}{1-\\nu}\\sigma_{11}\\right)\n$$\nThese relations have the same structure as the plane stress equations if we perform the substitutions $E \\to E/(1-\\nu^2)$ and $\\nu \\to \\nu/(1-\\nu)$. Since the near-tip stress field is the same for a given $K_I$ in both cases, the entire derivation of the $J-K_I$ relationship for plane strain must follow from the plane stress result by applying this substitution. The scaling factor for compliance is now $\\frac{1-\\nu^2}{E}$ instead of $\\frac{1}{E}$.\n$$\nJ_{\\text{pe}} \\propto \\frac{(1-\\nu^2)K_I^2}{E}\n$$\nThis implies that the effective modulus for plane strain is:\n$$\nE'_{\\text{pe}} = \\frac{E}{1-\\nu^2}\n$$\n\nThird, we report the final expressions for $J$ as a function of $K_I$, $E$, and $\\nu$. Utilizing the standard relationship $J=K_I^2/E'$ and the effective moduli derived above, we obtain the two required expressions.\n\nFor plane stress:\n$$\nJ_{\\text{ps}} = \\frac{K_I^2}{E'_{\\text{ps}}} = \\frac{K_I^2}{E}\n$$\nFor plane strain:\n$$\nJ_{\\text{pe}} = \\frac{K_I^2}{E'_{\\text{pe}}} = \\frac{K_I^2}{E/(1-\\nu^2)} = \\frac{(1-\\nu^2)K_I^2}{E}\n$$\nThese are the canonical relationships between the $J$-integral and the Mode I stress intensity factor in linear elastic fracture mechanics.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{K_I^2}{E} & \\frac{(1-\\nu^2)K_I^2}{E} \\end{pmatrix}}$$", "id": "2571466"}, {"introduction": "Moving from theory to numerical practice, we address the critical task of verifying the accuracy of $J$-integral values computed via the Finite Element Method (FEM).

The same contact field as above is present. Assume frictionless unilateral contact and no body forces.\n\nUsing the definition of the $J$-integral and its domain form that includes a crack-face traction term, determine which of the following statements are correct.\n\nA. In the linear elastic case with traction-free faces, the energy release rate is $J_{\\mathrm{TF}}=\\dfrac{K_I^2+K_{II}^2}{E}$, which evaluates to approximately $2543$ N/m for the given data. With the specified compressive contact, the crack-face term contributes $J_{\\mathrm{face}}=\\alpha\\,p_0\\,l_c=1000$ N/m, so the effective $J$ reduces to $J_{\\mathrm{C}}=J_{\\mathrm{TF}}-J_{\\mathrm{face}}\\approx 1543$ N/m.\n\nB. Because the $J$-integral is path independent, crack-face tractions never contribute to $J$. Therefore, $J$ is unchanged by contact and remains $2543$ N/m in the linear elastic case.\n\nC. In the elastic-plastic Ramberg–Osgood case with the reported FEM area-integral $J_{\\mathrm{dom,EP}}=3744$ N/m on the same outer ring for both traction-free and contact models, the same compressive contact field reduces the effective $J$ by $1000$ N/m, giving $J_{\\mathrm{EP,C}}=2744$ N/m.\n\nD. In frictionless unilateral contact, the crack-face traction term does positive work on a virtual crack extension and therefore increases $J$ by $1000$ N/m relative to traction-free faces in both linear elastic and elastic-plastic cases.\n\nSelect all that apply.", "solution": "The problem statement is subjected to validation.\n\n### Step 1: Extract Givens\n- **Geometry**: An infinite, isotropic, homogeneous plate with a straight through-crack of length $2a$.

No body forces.\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\nThe problem is scientifically grounded in the field of fracture mechanics, specifically dealing with the $J$-integral for linear elastic and elastic-plastic materials. The concepts of mixed-mode loading, stress intensity factors, and crack-face contact are standard topics. The problem is well-posed, providing all necessary numerical data and explicit assumptions (plane stress, small deformations) to perform the required calculations. The given formulae for $K_I$ and $K_{II}$ are correct for the specified geometry. The description of crack-face contact, including the pressure distribution and displacement gradient, while being an idealization, is specific enough to permit a formal analysis. The problem is objective and free of scientific or factual unsoundness. The question is directly related to the topic of J-integral evaluation.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem statement is a valid, albeit advanced, exercise in continuum and fracture mechanics. We proceed to the solution.\n\n### Derivation\nThe $J$-integral is defined for a counter-clockwise path $\\Gamma$ starting on the lower crack face and ending on the upper crack face, around a crack tip, as:\n$$J = \\int_\\Gamma \\left(W n_1 - T_i \\frac{\\partial u_i}{\\partial x_1}\\right) ds$$\nwhere $W$ is the strain energy density, $\\mathbf{n}$ is the outward normal to the path $\\Gamma$, $\\mathbf{T} = \\mathbf{\\sigma} \\cdot \\mathbf{n}$ is the traction vector on $\\Gamma$, and $\\mathbf{u}$ is the displacement vector.\n\nFor a material described by deformation theory of plasticity (which includes linear elasticity) and in the absence of body forces, the path-independence relation is modified by tractions on the crack faces ($\\Gamma_c$) within the integration path. The J-integral evaluated at the tip ($J_{\\text{tip}}$) is related to the value on a remote path ($J_{\\text{remote}}$) by:\n$$J_{\\text{tip}} = J_{\\text{remote}} - \\int_{\\Gamma_c} T_i \\frac{\\partial u_i}{\\partial x_1} ds$$\nHere, the integral is taken over the contour path along the crack faces. The contour runs from right to left on the upper face ($\\Gamma_c^+$) and from left to right on the lower face ($\\Gamma_c^-$). We must carefully evaluate the tractions $T_i$ on this contour.\n- On the upper face $\\Gamma_c^+$: The contour normal is $\\mathbf{n}=(0, 1)$. The contact pressure $p(s)$ creates a stress $\\sigma_{22}=-p(s)$. The traction on the contour is $T_2 = \\sigma_{22}n_2 = (-p)(1)=-p$.\n- On the lower face $\\Gamma_c^-$: The contour normal is $\\mathbf{n}=(0, -1)$. The stress is $\\sigma_{22}=-p(s)$. The traction on the contour is $T_2 = \\sigma_{22}n_2 = (-p)(-1)=p$.\n\nWith frictionless contact ($T_1=0$) and a constant normal displacement gradient $\\frac{\\partial u_n}{\\partial x_1} \\approx \\alpha$, the crack-face integral becomes:\n$$\\int_{\\Gamma_c} T_i \\frac{\\partial u_i}{\\partial x_1} ds = \\int_{a}^{a-l_c} (-p(x_1))\\alpha \\,dx_1 + \\int_{a-l_c}^{a} (p(x_1))\\alpha \\,dx_1$$\nThe first integral, due to the reversed limits, becomes positive:\n$$\\alpha \\int_{a-l_c}^{a} p(x_1) \\,dx_1 + \\alpha \\int_{a-l_c}^{a} p(x_1) \\,dx_1 = 2\\alpha \\int_{a-l_c}^{a} p(x_1) \\,dx_1$$\nThis positive term represents the contribution from face tractions, which we will call $J_{\\text{face}}$. The integral of the given pressure distribution is:\n$$\\int_0^{l_c} p(s) ds = \\int_0^{l_c} p_0\\left(1-\\frac{s}{l_c}\\right) ds = p_0 \\left[s - \\frac{s^2}{2l_c}\\right]_0^{l_c} = \\frac{p_0 l_c}{2}$$\nTherefore, the magnitude of the crack-face term is:\n$$J_{\\text{face}} = 2\\alpha \\left(\\frac{p_0 l_c}{2}\\right) = \\alpha p_0 l_c$$\nThe effective $J$-integral at the crack tip is thus reduced (shielded) by this amount:\n$$J_{\\text{tip}} = J_{\\text{remote}} - J_{\\text{face}} = J_{\\text{remote}} - \\alpha p_0 l_c$$\n\nNow, we evaluate the numerical values.\nThe crack-face contribution is:\n$$J_{\\text{face}} = (5 \\times 10^{-3}) \\times (40 \\times 10^6 \\, \\text{Pa}) \\times (5 \\times 10^{-3} \\, \\text{m}) = 1000 \\, \\text{N/m}$$\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**Linear Elastic Case:**\nFirst, we calculate the $J$-integral for the traction-free case, $J_{\\mathrm{TF}}$, which is the remote J-integral.\nThe stress intensity factors are:\n$$K_I = \\sigma_\\infty\\sqrt{\\pi a} = (50\\times 10^{6}) \\sqrt{\\pi \\times 0.05} \\approx 19.817 \\times 10^6 \\, \\text{Pa}\\sqrt{\\text{m}}$$\n$$K_{II} = \\tau_\\infty\\sqrt{\\pi a} = (30\\times 10^{6}) \\sqrt{\\pi \\times 0.05} \\approx 11.890 \\times 10^6 \\, \\text{Pa}\\sqrt{\\text{m}}$$\nFor plane stress, the energy release rate is:\n$$J_{\\mathrm{TF}} = \\frac{K_I^2 + K_{II}^2}{E} = \\frac{(19.817 \\times 10^6)^2 + (11.890 \\times 10^6)^2}{210 \\times 10^9}$$\n$$J_{\\mathrm{TF}} = \\frac{3.927 \\times 10^{14} + 1.414 \\times 10^{14}}{2.1 \\times 10^{11}} = \\frac{5.341 \\times 10^{14}}{2.1 \\times 10^{11}} \\approx 2543 \\, \\text{N/m}$$\nWith contact, the effective $J$-integral, $J_{\\mathrm{C}}$, becomes:\n$$J_{\\mathrm{C}} = J_{\\mathrm{TF}} - J_{\\text{face}} = 2543 \\, \\text{N/m} - 1000 \\, \\text{N/m} = 1543 \\, \\text{N/m}$$\n\n**Elastic-Plastic Case:**\nThe problem states that for the elastic-plastic material, a nonlinear FEM simulation yields an area-integral contribution of $J_{\\mathrm{dom,EP}}=3744$ N/m on an outer ring. This value represents the far-field or remote $J$-integral, $J_{\\text{remote}}$. The principle of accounting for crack-face tractions remains the same. The effective $J$ at the tip, $J_{\\mathrm{EP,C}}$, is:\n$$J_{\\mathrm{EP,C}} = J_{\\text{remote}} - J_{\\text{face}} = 3744 \\, \\text{N/m} - 1000 \\, \\text{N/m} = 2744 \\, \\text{N/m}$$\n\nWith these results, we evaluate the provided options.\n\n**A. In the linear elastic case with traction-free faces, the energy release rate is $J_{\\mathrm{TF}}=\\dfrac{K_I^2+K_{II}^2}{E}$, which evaluates to approximately $2543$ N/m for the given data. With the specified compressive contact, the crack-face term contributes $J_{\\mathrm{face}}=\\alpha\\,p_0\\,l_c=1000$ N/m, so the effective $J$ reduces to $J_{\\mathrm{C}}=J_{\\mathrm{TF}}-J_{\\mathrm{face}}\\approx 1543$ N/m.**\nOur calculation confirms $J_{\\mathrm{TF}} \\approx 2543$ N/m. The calculation of the crack-face term $J_{\\text{face}} = \\alpha p_0 l_c = 1000$ N/m is also correct. The final effective $J$ is indeed $J_{\\mathrm{C}} = J_{\\mathrm{TF}} - J_{\\text{face}} = 2543 - 1000 = 1543$ N/m. The statement that $J$ reduces is physically correct, representing shielding. Every part of this statement is correct.\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\n**B. Because the $J$-integral is path independent, crack-face tractions never contribute to $J$. Therefore, $J$ is unchanged by contact and remains $2543$ N/m in the linear elastic case.**\nThis statement is fundamentally flawed. The path independence of the $J$-integral holds only under specific conditions, which include the absence of tractions on the crack faces within the integration contour. When crack faces are loaded, the value of the line integral depends on whether the path encloses these tractions. The energy release rate at the tip, the physical meaning of $J$, is certainly affected by forces acting on the crack faces.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**C. In the elastic-plastic Ramberg–Osgood case with the reported FEM area-integral $J_{\\mathrm{dom,EP}}=3744$ N/m on the same outer ring for both traction-free and contact models, the same compressive contact field reduces the effective $J$ by $1000$ N/m, giving $J_{\\mathrm{EP,C}}=2744$ N/m.**\nThe provided $J_{\\mathrm{dom,EP}}=3744$ N/m is the remote $J$-integral for the case with contact. The contribution from the contact tractions, $J_{\\text{face}}$, depends only on the given contact kinematics and pressure field, not the bulk constitutive law, so it remains $1000$ N/m. The principle of subtracting this contribution is valid for deformation-theory plasticity. The calculation is $J_{\\mathrm{EP,C}} = 3744 - 1000 = 2744$ N/m. The statement is consistent with our analysis.\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\n**D. In frictionless unilateral contact, the crack-face traction term does positive work on a virtual crack extension and therefore increases $J$ by $1000$ N/m relative to traction-free faces in both linear elastic and elastic-plastic cases.**\nCompressive contact tractions resist crack opening and propagation. They have a shielding effect, meaning they reduce the crack driving force. Therefore, the effective $J$-integral at the tip must be lower than the remote $J$-integral. Our analysis yielded $J_{\\text{tip}} = J_{\\text{remote}} - J_{\\text{face}}$, where $J_{\\text{face}}=1000$ N/m is a positive quantity. This confirms the reduction. The statement that $J$ increases is physically and mathematically incorrect.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{AC}$$", "id": "2571456"}]}
