A solution will now be constructed.\n\n**1) Computation of $\\partial J/\\partial u$**\n\nThe output functional is given by $J(u,p) = \\frac{1}{2} u^T Q(p) u$. To compute the partial derivative of the scalar $J$ with respect to the vector $u$, we consider the differential $\\mathrm{d}J$ for a perturbation $\\mathrm{d}u$ at a fixed parameter $p$.\n$$\n\\mathrm{d}J = \\frac{1}{2} (\\mathrm{d}u)^T Q u + \\frac{1}{2} u^T Q (\\mathrm{d}u)\n$$\nSince $(\\mathrm{d}u)^T Q u$ is a scalar, it is equal to its own transpose: $(\\mathrm{d}u)^T Q u = (u^T Q^T (\\mathrm{d}u))^T = u^T Q^T (\\mathrm{d}u)$. Substituting this into the first term gives:\n$$\n\\mathrm{d}J = \\frac{1}{2} u^T Q^T (\\mathrm{d}u) + \\frac{1}{2} u^T Q (\\mathrm{d}u) = \\frac{1}{2} u^T (Q^T + Q) \\mathrm{d}u\n$$\nThe problem states that the matrix $Q(p)$ is symmetric, so $Q^T = Q$. The expression simplifies to:\n$$\n\\mathrm{d}J = \\frac{1}{2} u^T (2Q) \\mathrm{d}u = u^T Q \\mathrm{d}u\n$$\nBy definition, the differential $\\mathrm{d}J$ is related to the partial derivative (a row vector, or covector) by $\\mathrm{d}J = \\frac{\\partial J}{\\partial u} \\mathrm{d}u$. By comparison, we identify the partial derivative of $J$ with respect to $u$ as:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial J}{\\partial u} = u^T Q(p)\n$$\nThe gradient of $J$ with respect to $u$, denoted $\\nabla_u J$, is the transpose of this row vector, which would be the column vector $Q(p)u$.\n\n**2) Derivation of the Adjoint Equation and Sensitivity Expression**\n\nThe goal is to find the total derivative $\\mathrm{d}J/\\mathrm{d}p$. The functional $J$ depends on $p$ both explicitly through $Q(p)$ and implicitly through the state vector $u(p)$. Applying the multivariable chain rule:\n$$\n\\frac{\\mathrm{d}J}{\\mathrm{d}p} = \\frac{\\partial J}{\\partial p} + \\frac{\\partial J}{\\partial u} \\frac{\\mathrm{d}u}{\\mathrm{d}p}\n$$\nThe first term, the explicit derivative, is computed by differentiating $J$ with respect to $p$ while holding $u$ constant:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial J}{\\partial p} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial p} \\left( \\frac{1}{2} u^T Q(p) u \\right) = \\frac{1}{2} u^T \\frac{\\partial Q}{\\partial p} u\n$$\nSubstituting this and the result from part 1) gives the expression for the total derivative, which is known as the direct sensitivity formula:\n$$\n\\frac{\\mathrm{d}J}{\\mathrm{d}p} = \\frac{1}{2} u^T \\frac{\\partial Q}{\\partial p} u + u^T Q \\frac{\\mathrm{d}u}{\\mathrm{d}p}\n$$\nThis expression depends on the state sensitivity $\\mathrm{d}u/\\mathrm{d}p$, which is computationally expensive to obtain as it requires solving a linear system for each parameter. The adjoint method circumvents this.\n\nWe use the method of Lagrange multipliers. The constraint is the state equation, written as a residual $R(u,p) = K(p)u - f(p) = 0$. We form the augmented functional $\\mathcal{L}$ by adjoining the constraint to the original functional $J$ using a vector of Lagrange multipliers $\\lambda \\in \\mathbb{R}^n$, which we will call the adjoint vector.\n$$\n\\mathcal{L}(u, p, \\lambda) = J(u, p) + \\lambda^T R(u, p) = \\frac{1}{2} u^T Q u + \\lambda^T (Ku - f)\n$$\nSince the state equation is always satisfied ($R(u(p), p) = 0$), we have $\\mathcal{L} = J$ for any choice of $\\lambda$. Therefore, their total derivatives with respect to $p$ are equal: $\\mathrm{d}J/\\mathrm{d}p = \\mathrm{d}\\mathcal{L}/\\mathrm{d}p$. We compute $\\mathrm{d}\\mathcal{L}/\\mathrm{d}p$ by applying the chain rule to $\\mathcal{L}$ as a function of $u$, $p$, and $\\lambda$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\mathrm{d}\\mathcal{L}}{\\mathrm{d}p} = \\frac{\\partial \\mathcal{L}}{\\partial p} + \\frac{\\partial \\mathcal{L}}{\\partial u} \\frac{\\mathrm{d}u}{\\mathrm{d}p} + \\frac{\\partial \\mathcal{L}}{\\partial \\lambda} \\frac{\\mathrm{d}\\lambda}{\\mathrm{d}p}\n$$\nThe core of the adjoint method is to choose $\\lambda$ to annihilate the term containing the state sensitivity $\\mathrm{d}u/\\mathrm{d}p$. This is achieved by setting its coefficient to zero:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial \\mathcal{L}}{\\partial u} = 0\n$$\nLet us compute this partial derivative:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial \\mathcal{L}}{\\partial u} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial u} \\left( \\frac{1}{2} u^T Q u + \\lambda^T K u - \\lambda^T f \\right) = u^T Q + \\lambda^T K\n$$\nSetting this to zero yields the condition $u^T Q + \\lambda^T K = 0$. Transposing this equation gives the standard form of the **adjoint equation**:\n$$\n(u^T Q + \\lambda^T K)^T = 0^T \\implies Q^T u + K^T \\lambda = 0\n$$\nSince $Q$ is symmetric ($Q^T = Q$), we have:\n$$\nK^T \\lambda = -Q u\n$$\nThis is a linear system of equations that defines the adjoint vector $\\lambda(p)$. Notice it involves the transpose of the stiffness matrix, $K^T$, and its solution requires the state vector $u$.\n\nWith this specific choice of $\\lambda$, the term $\\frac{\\partial \\mathcal{L}}{\\partial u} \\frac{\\mathrm{d}u}{\\mathrm{d}p}$ in the expression for $\\mathrm{d}\\mathcal{L}/\\mathrm{d}p$ becomes zero. Furthermore, the term $\\frac{\\partial \\mathcal{L}}{\\partial \\lambda}$ is simply $R^T$. As the state equation $R=0$ must hold, this term is also zero, so $\\frac{\\partial \\mathcal{L}}{\\partial \\lambda} \\frac{\\mathrm{d}\\lambda}{\\mathrm{d}p} = 0$ regardless of $\\mathrm{d}\\lambda/\\mathrm{d}p$.\n\nThe total derivative of the functional thus simplifies to:\n$$\n\\frac{\\mathrm{d}J}{\\mathrm{d}p} = \\frac{\\mathrm{d}\\mathcal{L}}{\\mathrm{d}p} = \\frac{\\partial \\mathcal{L}}{\\partial p}\n$$\nWe now compute the partial derivative of $\\mathcal{L}$ with respect to $p$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial \\mathcal{L}}{\\partial p} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial p} \\left( \\frac{1}{2} u^T Q(p) u + \\lambda^T (K(p)u - f(p)) \\right) = \\frac{1}{2} u^T \\frac{\\partial Q}{\\partial p} u + \\lambda^T \\left( \\frac{\\partial K}{\\partial p} u - \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial p} \\right)\n$$\nThis gives the final sensitivity expression:\n$$\n\\frac{\\mathrm{d}J}{\\mathrm{d}p} = \\frac{1}{2} u^T \\frac{\\partial Q}{\\partial p} u + \\lambda^T \\left( \\frac{\\partial K}{\\partial p} u - \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial p} \\right)\n$$\n\n**3) Explanation for the Elimination of $\\mathrm{d}u/\\mathrm{d}p$**\n\nThe final expression for the gradient $\\mathrm{d}J/\\mathrm{d}p$ does not require solving for the state sensitivity vector $\\mathrm{d}u/\\mathrm{d}p$ because of the specific construction of the adjoint problem. By introducing the Lagrange multiplier (adjoint) vector $\\lambda$ and forming the augmented functional $\\mathcal{L}$, we gain an additional degree of freedom. This freedom is used to impose the adjoint equation, $K^T\\lambda = -Qu$. This equation is specifically designed to be the condition that makes the coefficient of the $\\mathrm{d}u/\\mathrm{d}p$ term in the chain rule expansion of $\\mathrm{d}\\mathcal{L}/\\mathrm{d}p$ equal to zero. By satisfying this adjoint equation, the dependence of the total derivative $\\mathrm{d}J/\\mathrm{d}p$ on the state sensitivity $\\mathrm{d}u/\\mathrm{d}p$ is algebraically eliminated, leaving only terms that depend on the state $u$, the adjoint state $\\lambda$, and the direct partial derivatives of the problem data ($K$, $f$, $Q$) with respect to the parameter $p$. This constitutes the primary advantage of the adjoint method for sensitivity analysis involving a large number of parameters, as one only needs to solve one state system and one adjoint system, rather than a new system for each parameter's sensitivity.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\frac{1}{2} u^T \\frac{\\partial Q}{\\partial p} u + \\lambda^T \\left( \\frac{\\partial K}{\\partial p} u - \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial p} \\right)}\n$$", "id": "2594547"}, {"introduction": "Once the abstract machinery of the adjoint method is established, a critical step towards mastery is building physical intuition.

The implementation steps are correct: insert $p_k \\mapsto p_k + i\\,h$ consistently wherever $p_k$ appears in $K(p)$ and $f(p)$, assemble and solve the complex system with boundary conditions imposed on the full complex unknowns, evaluate $J$ with the same complex inputs, and take $\\operatorname{Im}(\\cdot)/h$. The guidance on $h$ acknowledges that very small values are acceptable in complex-step because no real-part subtraction occurs. Verdict — Correct.\n\n- Option B: This option switches to a real forward-difference formula and invokes the heuristic $h=\\sqrt{\\epsilon_{\\mathrm{mach}}}$ to reduce subtractive cancellation, but it neither uses the complex-step method nor avoids subtractive cancellation in principle. Real finite differences do suffer from cancellation when $h$ is too small, which is exactly what complex-step circumvents. Furthermore, subtracting $J(U(p),p)$ and dividing the real part by $h$ produces the standard forward difference, which lacks the machine-precision behavior of the complex-step approach. As a response to the prompt, this neither provides the complex-step justification nor the correct implementation. Verdict — Incorrect.\n\n- Option C: This option perturbs the solution vector $U$ directly by $i\\,h\\,e_r$ rather than perturbing the parameter $p_k$. The imaginary part of $J(U + i\\,h\\,e_r,p)/h$ approximates the directional derivative $\\partial J/\\partial U \\cdot e_r$ at fixed $p$, not $\\partial J/\\partial p_k$. It therefore estimates a different quantity and does not solve the implicit dependence of $U$ on $p_k$ through $R(U,p)=0$. Verdict — Incorrect.\n\n- Option D: This option assembles with $p_k + i\\,h$ but then (i) enforces essential boundary conditions only on the real part, which is inconsistent for a complex solve because the imaginary part remains unconstrained and violates the prescribed values, corrupting the perturbation; and (ii) uses the real part of $J$ divided by $h$ to estimate the derivative, whereas the complex-step identity requires the imaginary part, not the real part. The real part differs from $J(U(p),p)$ only by $\\mathcal{O}(h^2)$ and does not provide the desired first derivative upon division by $h$. Verdict — Incorrect.\n\nTherefore, only Option A both justifies the method correctly and specifies the correct discrete implementation steps that avoid subtractive cancellation.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2594554"}]}
