Finite Element Discretization**\n\nThe domain, a bar of length $L=2$, is discretized into two linear finite elements of equal length.\n- Element 1 connects node 1 ($x=0$) and node 2 ($x=1$). Its length is $l_1=1$ and its density is $\\rho_1=0.5$.\n- Element 2 connects node 2 ($x=1$) and node 3 ($x=2$). Its length is $l_2=1$ and its density is $\\rho_2=1.0$.\n\nThe element thermal conductivity, $k_e$, is given by the Solid Isotropic Material with Penalization (SIMP) model:\n$$k(\\rho_e) = k_{\\min} + \\rho_e^p (k_0 - k_{\\min})$$\nUsing the provided data $k_0 = 2$, $k_{\\min} = 0.2$, and $p = 3$:\nFor element 1 ($\\rho_1=0.5$):\n$$k_1 = 0.2 + (0.5)^3 (2 - 0.2) = 0.2 + 0.125 \\times 1.8 = 0.2 + 0.225 = 0.425$$\nFor element 2 ($\\rho_2=1.0$):\n$$k_2 = 0.2 + (1.0)^3 (2 - 0.2) = 0.2 + 1.8 = 2.0$$\n\nThe element conductivity matrix for a 1D linear element is given by:\n$$\\mathbf{k}^e = \\frac{k_e A_e}{l_e} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & -1 \\\\ -1 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$$\nGiven $A=1$ and $l_1=l_2=1$, the element matrices are:\n$$\\mathbf{k}^1 = k_1 \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & -1 \\\\ -1 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} = 0.425 \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & -1 \\\\ -1 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$$\n$$\\mathbf{k}^2 = k_2 \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & -1 \\\\ -1 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} = 2.0 \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & -1 \\\\ -1 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$$\n\nAssembling these into a global $3 \\times 3$ conductivity matrix for nodes 1, 2, and 3:\n$$\\mathbf{K}_{global} = \\begin{pmatrix} k_1 & -k_1 & 0 \\\\ -k_1 & k_1+k_2 & -k_2 \\\\ 0 & -k_2 & k_2 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0.425 & -0.425 & 0 \\\\ -0.425 & 2.425 & -2.0 \\\\ 0 & -2.0 & 2.0 \\end{pmatrix}$$\n\nThe boundary condition $T(0)=0$ implies $T_1=0$.

The equivalent nodal load is $Q_3 = \\bar{q} A = 1 \\times 1 = 1$. There is no heat source at node 2, so $Q_2=0$.

Primal Analysis: Solution of the State Equation**\n\nThe governing system of equations for the unknown temperatures is $\\mathbf{K}\\mathbf{T} = \\mathbf{Q}$:\n$$\\begin{pmatrix} 2.425 & -2.0 \\\\ -2.0 & 2.0 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} T_2 \\\\ T_3 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}$$\nFrom the second equation:\n$$-2.0 T_2 + 2.0 T_3 = 1 \\implies T_3 = T_2 + 0.5$$\nSubstituting this into the first equation:\n$$2.425 T_2 - 2.0 (T_2 + 0.5) = 0 \\implies 2.425 T_2 - 2.0 T_2 - 1.0 = 0$$\n$$0.425 T_2 = 1.0 \\implies T_2 = \\frac{1}{0.425} = \\frac{1}{17/40} = \\frac{40}{17}$$\nNow we find $T_3$:\n$$T_3 = \\frac{40}{17} + 0.5 = \\frac{40}{17} + \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{80+17}{34} = \\frac{97}{34}$$\nThe temperature vector is $\\mathbf{T} = \\begin{pmatrix} 40/17 \\\\ 97/34 \\end{pmatrix}$.\n\n**3. Adjoint Sensitivity Analysis**\n\nThe objective function to be minimized is the thermal compliance, $\\mathcal{C} = \\mathbf{Q}^{\\mathsf{T}}\\mathbf{T}$. We seek its derivative with respect to the design variable $\\rho_1$. Following the mandate to derive the adjoint problem from first principles, we define an augmented objective functional $\\hat{\\mathcal{C}}$ using a vector of Lagrange multipliers $\\boldsymbol{\\lambda}$ (the adjoint variables) to enforce the state equation $\\mathbf{K}\\mathbf{T} = \\mathbf{Q}$:\n$$\\hat{\\mathcal{C}}(\\mathbf{T}, \\boldsymbol{\\rho}, \\boldsymbol{\\lambda}) = \\mathcal{C}(\\mathbf{T}) + \\boldsymbol{\\lambda}^{\\mathsf{T}} (\\mathbf{Q} - \\mathbf{K}(\\boldsymbol{\\rho})\\mathbf{T})$$\nThe total derivative of $\\mathcal{C}$ with respect to $\\rho_1$ is equal to the total derivative of $\\hat{\\mathcal{C}}$ since the constraint term is zero.\n$$\\frac{d\\mathcal{C}}{d\\rho_1} = \\frac{d\\hat{\\mathcal{C}}}{d\\rho_1} = \\frac{\\partial\\hat{\\mathcal{C}}}{\\partial\\rho_1} + \\frac{\\partial\\hat{\\mathcal{C}}}{\\partial\\mathbf{T}} \\frac{d\\mathbf{T}}{d\\rho_1}$$\nWe choose $\\boldsymbol{\\lambda}$ such that the term containing the unknown sensitivity of the state variables, $\\frac{d\\mathbf{T}}{d\\rho_1}$, vanishes. We set its coefficient to zero:\n$$\\frac{\\partial\\hat{\\mathcal{C}}}{\\partial\\mathbf{T}} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial\\mathbf{T}} (\\mathbf{Q}^{\\mathsf{T}}\\mathbf{T} + \\boldsymbol{\\lambda}^{\\mathsf{T}}\\mathbf{Q} - \\boldsymbol{\\lambda}^{\\mathsf{T}}\\mathbf{K}\\mathbf{T}) = \\mathbf{Q}^{\\mathsf{T}} - \\boldsymbol{\\lambda}^{\\mathsf{T}}\\mathbf{K} = \\mathbf{0}$$\nThis yields the adjoint equation:\n$$\\mathbf{K}^{\\mathsf{T}}\\boldsymbol{\\lambda} = \\mathbf{Q}$$\nSince the conductivity matrix $\\mathbf{K}$ is symmetric ($\\mathbf{K}^{\\mathsf{T}}=\\mathbf{K}$), the adjoint equation is $\\mathbf{K}\\boldsymbol{\\lambda} = \\mathbf{Q}$. This equation is identical in form to the primal state equation $\\mathbf{K}\\mathbf{T} = \\mathbf{Q}$. Therefore, the problem is self-adjoint, and the solution to the adjoint problem is the same as the solution to the primal problem:\n$$\\boldsymbol{\\lambda} = \\mathbf{T} = \\begin{pmatrix} 40/17 \\\\ 97/34 \\end{pmatrix}$$\nWith this choice of $\\boldsymbol{\\lambda}$, the sensitivity calculation simplifies to the partial derivative of $\\hat{\\mathcal{C}}$ with respect to $\\rho_1$:\n$$\\frac{d\\mathcal{C}}{d\\rho_1} = \\frac{\\partial\\hat{\\mathcal{C}}}{\\partial\\rho_1} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial\\rho_1} (\\mathbf{Q}^{\\mathsf{T}}\\mathbf{T} + \\boldsymbol{\\lambda}^{\\mathsf{T}}\\mathbf{Q} - \\boldsymbol{\\lambda}^{\\mathsf{T}}\\mathbf{K}\\mathbf{T}) = -\\boldsymbol{\\lambda}^{\\mathsf{T}} \\frac{\\partial\\mathbf{K}}{\\partial\\rho_1} \\mathbf{T}$$\n\n**4. Calculation of the Sensitivity**\n\nWe must find the derivative of the conductivity matrix $\\mathbf{K}$ with respect to $\\rho_1$:\n$$\\frac{\\partial\\mathbf{K}}{\\partial\\rho_1} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial\\rho_1} \\begin{pmatrix} k_1+k_2 & -k_2 \\\\ -k_2 & k_2 \\end{pmatrix}$$\nOnly $k_1$ is a function of $\\rho_1$. Thus:\n$$\\frac{\\partial\\mathbf{K}}{\\partial\\rho_1} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{dk_1}{d\\rho_1} & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$$\nThe derivative $\\frac{dk_1}{d\\rho_1}$ is found from the SIMP law:\n$$\\frac{dk_1}{d\\rho_1} = \\frac{d}{d\\rho_1} \\left(k_{\\min} + \\rho_1^p(k_0 - k_{\\min})\\right) = p \\rho_1^{p-1} (k_0 - k_{\\min})$$\nSubstituting the given values $p=3$, $\\rho_1=0.5$, $k_0=2$, and $k_{\\min}=0.2$:\n$$\\frac{dk_1}{d\\rho_1} = 3 \\times (0.5)^{3-1} \\times (2 - 0.2) = 3 \\times (0.5)^2 \\times 1.8 = 3 \\times 0.25 \\times 1.8 = 0.75 \\times 1.8 = 1.35$$\nSo, the derivative of the stiffness matrix is:\n$$\\frac{\\partial\\mathbf{K}}{\\partial\\rho_1} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1.35 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$$\nNow we substitute all parts into the sensitivity expression. Since $\\boldsymbol{\\lambda} = \\mathbf{T}$:\n$$\\frac{d\\mathcal{C}}{d\\rho_1} = -\\mathbf{T}^{\\mathsf{T}} \\frac{\\partial\\mathbf{K}}{\\partial\\rho_1} \\mathbf{T} = - \\begin{pmatrix} T_2 & T_3 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} 1.35 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} T_2 \\\\ T_3 \\end{pmatrix}$$\n$$\\frac{d\\mathcal{C}}{d\\rho_1} = -1.35 \\times T_2^2$$\nSubstituting the value of $T_2 = \\frac{40}{17}$:\n$$\\frac{d\\mathcal{C}}{d\\rho_1} = -1.35 \\times \\left(\\frac{40}{17}\\right)^2 = -1.35 \\times \\frac{1600}{289} \\approx -7.47404844...$$\nThe problem requests the result rounded to four significant figures.\n$$\\frac{d\\mathcal{C}}{d\\rho_1} \\approx -7.474$$\nThe units of compliance $\\mathcal{C}$ are units of heat load (Power, W) times temperature (K), so WÂ·K.

For compliance minimization with void nucleation, the sign of $D_T J(\\mathbf{x}_0)$ is indefinite and determined solely by the Poisson ratio, independent of the local mechanical state, so it cannot guide material removal.", "solution": "### Derivation\nThe objective is to minimize compliance, which is a measure of the global flexibility of the structure. The problem requires an evaluation of the sign and magnitude of the topological derivative, $D_T J(\\mathbf{x}_0)$, which quantifies the sensitivity of compliance to the introduction of an infinitesimal hole at a point $\\mathbf{x}_0$.\n\nFirst, we establish the relationship between compliance and total strain energy. For a linear elastic body under equilibrium with fixed external loads, Clapeyron's theorem holds. Assuming zero body forces and zero prescribed displacements on $\\Gamma_D$ (a standard assumption for this type of problem, though the result holds more generally), the work done by the external tractions is equal to twice the total strain energy stored in the body.\nThe total strain energy $U(\\Omega)$ is given by:\n$$\nU(\\Omega) = \\int_\\Omega W(\\mathbf{x}) \\, \\mathrm{d}V = \\int_\\Omega \\frac{1}{2} \\boldsymbol{\\sigma} : \\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}(\\mathbf{u}) \\, \\mathrm{d}V\n$$\nThe compliance is defined as $J(\\Omega) = \\int_{\\Gamma_N} \\mathbf{t} \\cdot \\mathbf{u} \\, \\mathrm{d}\\Gamma$. From the principle of virtual work and the constitutive relation, it follows that:\n$$\nJ(\\Omega) = \\int_\\Omega \\boldsymbol{\\sigma} : \\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}(\\mathbf{u}) \\, \\mathrm{d}V = 2 U(\\Omega)\n$$\nThus, minimizing compliance is equivalent to minimizing the total strain energy.\n\nNext, we analyze the effect of creating a small void $B_\\varepsilon(\\mathbf{x}_0)$ within the domain $\\Omega$. The new domain is $\\Omega_\\varepsilon = \\Omega \\setminus B_\\varepsilon(\\mathbf{x}_0)$. Let the solution on the new domain be $\\mathbf{u}_\\varepsilon$. The new compliance is $J(\\Omega_\\varepsilon) = \\int_{\\Gamma_N} \\mathbf{t} \\cdot \\mathbf{u}_\\varepsilon \\, \\mathrm{d}\\Gamma$.\n\nAccording to the principle of minimum potential energy, the structure will deform in a way that minimizes its total potential energy. Removing material from a structure can never increase its stiffness. A less stiff structure will deform more under the same applied loads. Therefore, the integrated displacement in the direction of the applied tractions will increase or, in the limit, remain the same. This means:\n$$\nJ(\\Omega_\\varepsilon) \\ge J(\\Omega)\n$$\nThe change in compliance, $\\Delta J = J(\\Omega_\\varepsilon) - J(\\Omega)$, is therefore non-negative. It follows directly that the topological derivative, being the limit of the ratio of this non-negative change to a positive volume, must also be non-negative:\n$$\nD_T J(\\mathbf{x}_0) = \\lim_{\\varepsilon \\to 0^+} \\frac{J(\\Omega_\\varepsilon) - J(\\Omega)}{|B_\\varepsilon(\\mathbf{x}_0)|} \\ge 0\n$$\nThe derivative $D_T J(\\mathbf{x}_0)$ can only be zero if the material at $\\mathbf{x}_0$ carries no stress, i.e., $W(\\mathbf{x}_0) = 0$. Otherwise, $D_T J(\\mathbf{x}_0)$ is strictly positive.\n\nNow, we must relate the magnitude of $D_T J(\\mathbf{x}_0)$ to the local strain energy density, $W(\\mathbf{x}_0)$. The quantity $D_T J(\\mathbf{x}_0)$ represents the price, in terms of increased compliance, for removing a unit volume of material at $\\mathbf{x}_0$. The material at a point $\\mathbf{x}_0$ contributes to the overall stiffness of the structure. This contribution is directly related to the load carried by the material at that point, which is quantified by the stress $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}(\\mathbf{x}_0)$ and strain $\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}(\\mathbf{x}_0)$, and thus by the strain energy density $W(\\mathbf{x}_0) = \\frac{1}{2} \\boldsymbol{\\sigma}(\\mathbf{x}_0) : \\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}(\\mathbf{x}_0)$.\n\nIf material is removed from a region of high strain energy density (high stress), the load paths must be significantly re-routed through surrounding material. This causes a substantial increase in the overall deformation and thus a large increase in compliance. Conversely, if material is removed from a region of low strain energy density (low stress), it was contributing little to the structure's stiffness, so its removal has a minor impact on overall deformation and compliance.\nTherefore, the magnitude of the increase in compliance, and thus the magnitude of $D_T J(\\mathbf{x}_0)$, is a monotonically increasing function of the local strain energy density $W(\\mathbf{x}_0)$. A higher $W(\\mathbf{x}_0)$ implies a larger, positive $D_T J(\\mathbf{x}_0)$.\n\nThe implication for material removal in an optimization context aiming to minimize compliance under a volume constraint is as follows: to achieve an optimal design, one must remove material from locations where the penalty (the increase in compliance) is smallest. This corresponds to regions where $D_T J(\\mathbf{x}_0)$ is minimal. Since $D_T J(\\mathbf{x}_0)$ is smallest where $W(\\mathbf{x}_0)$ is lowest, optimal material removal strategies favor removing material from low-stress regions while preserving material in high-stress regions.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. For compliance minimization with void nucleation, $D_T J(\\mathbf{x}_0)$ is negative at points of high $W(\\mathbf{x}_0)$, indicating that removing material there reduces compliance; moreover, the magnitude of $D_T J(\\mathbf{x}_0)$ decreases as $W(\\mathbf{x}_0)$ increases.**\n-   The statement that $D_T J(\\mathbf{x}_0)$ is negative is **Incorrect**. Removing load-bearing material increases flexibility and thus increases compliance, so $D_T J(\\mathbf{x}_0) \\ge 0$.\n-   The statement that the magnitude decreases as $W(\\mathbf{x}_0)$ increases is **Incorrect**. The sensitivity of compliance to material removal is greatest in highly stressed regions.\n-   Verdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**B. For compliance minimization with void nucleation, $D_T J(\\mathbf{x}_0)$ is positive and larger at points of high $W(\\mathbf{x}_0)$; removing material there increases compliance the most, so optimal designs avoid removal in high $W$ regions and favor removal where $W(\\mathbf{x}_0)$ is small.**\n-   The statement that $D_T J(\\mathbf{x}_0)$ is positive is **Correct**.\n-   The statement that it is larger at points of high $W(\\mathbf{x}_0)$ is **Correct**.\n-   The interpretation that removing material in high $W$ regions increases compliance the most is **Correct**.\n-   The conclusion that optimal designs favor removal where $W(\\mathbf{x}_0)$ is small is **Correct**. This is the fundamental principle of many topology optimization methods.\n-   Verdict: **Correct**.\n\n**C. For compliance minimization with void nucleation, $D_T J(\\mathbf{x}_0)$ vanishes wherever $\\nabla \\cdot \\boldsymbol{\\sigma}(\\mathbf{u})=\\mathbf{0}$ holds, hence it does not correlate with $W(\\mathbf{x}_0)$.**\n-   The equation $\\nabla \\cdot \\boldsymbol{\\sigma}(\\mathbf{u})=\\mathbf{0}$ represents local static equilibrium (assuming no body forces) and holds throughout the material domain. If $D_T J$ vanished wherever this holds, it would vanish everywhere, which is physically absurd. The topological derivative depends on the local values of stress and strain, not their spatial derivatives.\n-   The conclusion that it does not correlate with $W(\\mathbf{x}_0)$ is therefore based on a false premise and is **Incorrect**.\n-   Verdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. For compliance minimization with void nucleation, the sign of $D_T J(\\mathbf{x}_0)$ is indefinite and determined solely by the Poisson ratio, independent of the local mechanical state, so it cannot guide material removal.**\n-   The sign is not indefinite; it is non-negative, as derived from first principles. This statement is **Incorrect**.\n-   The value of $D_T J(\\mathbf{x}_0)$ is fundamentally dependent on the local mechanical state (stress and strain). It is zero in an unstressed region and large in a highly stressed one. The dependence is not solely on the Poisson ratio. This statement is **Incorrect**.\n-   The conclusion that it cannot guide material removal is **Incorrect**. It is precisely the quantity used for this purpose in topological optimization.\n-   Verdict: **Incorrect**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2604256"}]}
