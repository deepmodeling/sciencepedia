The fundamental principle of the Newton–Raphson method is that it achieves local quadratic convergence if and only if the tangent matrix used in the iterative updates is the exact derivative of the residual function with respect to the solution variables. In the context of a macroscopic boundary value problem, the tangent stiffness matrix is derived from the consistent material tangent, which is $\\mathbb{C}^H = \\dfrac{\\partial \\boldsymbol{\\sigma}^H}{\\partial \\bar{\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}}}$.\nStrategy (ii), analytical linearization followed by micro condensation, is designed to compute this derivative exactly at the discrete level. Therefore, using the resulting $\\mathbb{C}^H$ provides the true consistent tangent for the macroscopic problem, and local quadratic convergence should be expected.\nStrategy (i), using a finite-difference approximation, introduces an error. The computed tangent, $\\mathbb{C}^H_{FD}$, is only an approximation to the true tangent $\\mathbb{C}^H$. The error, known as truncation error, depends on the perturbation size. Using an inexact tangent in a Newton–Raphson scheme generally degrades the convergence rate from quadratic to linear. The statement correctly notes that the quadratic rate can be recovered in such inexact Newton methods if the perturbation size (and thus the tangent error) is reduced in a specific way as the macroscopic residual decreases.

In $3$D, the number of independent components of the symmetric strain tensor $\\bar{\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}}$ is $n_s = d(d+1)/2 = 3(3+1)/2 = 6$.\nTo compute $\\mathbb{C}^H$ via forward finite differences, one must perturb each of the $n_s$ components of $\\bar{\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}}$.

Thus, one additional non-linear RVE solve is needed for each of the $n_s=6$ components, totaling $6$ additional solves.\nFor a central-difference approximation, $\\mathbb{C}^H_{ijkl} \\approx (\\sigma^H_{ij}(\\bar{\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}} + \\Delta\\varepsilon_{kl} \\mathbf{E}_{kl}) - \\sigma^H_{ij}(\\bar{\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}} - \\Delta\\varepsilon_{kl} \\mathbf{E}_{kl})) / (2\\Delta\\varepsilon_{kl})$. This requires two RVE solves for each component (one positive perturbation, one negative), totaling $2n_s = 12$ additional solves.\nIn contrast, the analytical micro condensation method works by first solving the non-linear RVE problem for the unperturbed strain $\\bar{\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}}$. Then, at the converged microscopic state, the microscopic tangent stiffness matrix $\\mathbf{K}_T$ is assembled. The analytical expression for $\\mathbb{C}^H$ involves the sensitivity of the microscopic fields to the macroscopic strain. Computing these sensitivities requires solving linear systems of the form $\\mathbf{K}_T \\mathbf{x} = \\mathbf{b}$ for $n_s$ different right-hand sides $\\mathbf{b}$. The efficient way to do this is to compute the LU factorization of $\\mathbf{K}_T$ once, which is the most expensive step, and then use this factorization to solve for the $n_s$ different right-hand sides via inexpensive forward and backward substitutions (back-solves).\nThe statement accurately describes both the number of RVE solves required for finite differences and the standard, efficient procedure for analytical condensation.\n\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\n**Analysis of Statement C**\nThis statement claims that central finite differences *always* yield a symmetric homogenized tangent $\\mathbb{C}^H$.

This symmetry is guaranteed for the *exact* tangent if the homogenized response can be derived from a strain energy potential, $W^H(\\bar{\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}})$, such that $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}^H = \\partial W^H / \\partial \\bar{\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}}$ and $\\mathbb{C}^H = \\partial^2 W^H / \\partial \\bar{\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}}^2$.\nThe central-difference approximation for the component $(\\mathbb{C}^H_{CD})_{ijkl}$ is $\\frac{\\sigma^H_{ij}(\\bar{\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}} + h \\mathbf{E}_{kl}) - \\sigma^H_{ij}(\\bar{\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}} - h \\mathbf{E}_{kl})}{2h}$. The symmetric component $(\\mathbb{C}^H_{CD})_{klij}$ is $\\frac{\\sigma^H_{kl}(\\bar{\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}} + h \\mathbf{E}_{ij}) - \\sigma^H_{kl}(\\bar{\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}} - h \\mathbf{E}_{ij})}{2h}$. While for an exact analytical function $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}^H$ derived from a potential these two expressions would be equal, the problem specifies a numerical context where $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}^H$ is the result of a non-linear RVE solve converged to a finite tolerance $\\eta$. The computed stresses $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}^H(\\bar{\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}} \\pm h \\mathbf{E}_{kl})$ and $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}^H(\\bar{\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}} \\pm h \\mathbf{E}_{ij})$ are obtained from four independent non-linear solves. Each solve introduces numerical errors (e.g., from iterative convergence not reaching zero residual, and from finite-precision arithmetic) that are uncorrelated. These small, random-like numerical errors will break the perfect mathematical symmetry. The statement's claim \"always\" and \"regardless of... numerical tolerances\" is too strong and factually incorrect in a practical computational setting.\n\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**Analysis of Statement D**\nThis statement discusses the choice of the perturbation amplitude, $\\Delta \\bar{\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}}$, for finite-difference methods. It correctly identifies the fundamental trade-off in numerical differentiation.\n1.  **Truncation Error**: The finite-difference formula is a truncated Taylor series expansion. This introduces a truncation error that scales with the perturbation size $h = |\\Delta \\bar{\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}}|$. For a forward difference, the error is $O(h)$; for a central difference, it is $O(h^2)$. A large $h$ leads to a large truncation error.\n2.  **Conditioning/Noise Error**: The formula involves the subtraction of two nearly equal values of stress, $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}^H(\\bar{\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}}+\\Delta\\bar{\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}})$ and $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}^H(\\bar{\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}})$. The stress values themselves are not exact; they are computed up to a tolerance $\\eta$, so they contain \"noise\" of order $\\eta$ (in appropriate units) and round-off error from floating-point arithmetic. When subtracting two close numbers, the absolute error is preserved while the relative error is magnified. Dividing this result by a small number $h$ further amplifies the error. This error contribution is proportional to $\\epsilon/h$, where $\\epsilon$ is the effective error in the stress evaluation (related to $\\eta$ and machine precision).\nTherefore, an optimal $h$ exists that balances these two competing error sources. The optimal step size for a first-order scheme like forward differences indeed scales as $h_{opt} \\propto \\sqrt{\\epsilon}$. Given the micro-solver tolerance $\\eta$, it is a sound practical guideline to choose the perturbation on the order of $\\sqrt{\\eta}$.\nFinally, the analytical micro condensation method is a direct mathematical derivation. It does not involve any perturbation parameter $h$, and thus completely bypasses the problem of step-size selection. The statement is a correct and practical summary of the issues.\n\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\n**Analysis of Statement E**\nThis statement claims finite-difference tangents are \"universally cheaper\" because they \"avoid assembling and solving microscopic linear systems.\" This premise is fundamentally false. A finite-difference approach requires multiple *full non-linear RVE solves*. Each non-linear solve, using the specified Newton–Raphson method, involves a loop of iterations. In each iteration, one must assemble the microscopic tangent stiffness matrix $\\mathbf{K}_T$ and solve a linear system of equations $\\mathbf{K}_T \\Delta \\mathbf{u} = \\mathbf{r}$. Therefore, the finite-difference method does not avoid solving linear systems; it does so repeatedly within each of the $n_s$ (or $2n_s$) non-linear RVE solves.\nThe analytical method requires one non-linear RVE solve (which itself involves assembling and solving linear systems), followed by one extra assembly and factorization of $\\mathbf{K}_T$ at the converged state, and $n_s$ inexpensive back-substitutions.\nA coarse cost comparison for a 3D problem ($n_s=6$) using forward differences:\n- Cost(FD) $\\approx 6 \\times (\\text{Cost of one non-linear RVE solve})$.\n- Cost(Analytical) $\\approx 1 \\times (\\text{Cost of one non-linear RVE solve}) + (\\text{Cost of one factorization of } \\mathbf{K}_T) + 6 \\times (\\text{Cost of back-solve})$.\nSince a non-linear solve typically takes several Newton iterations (e.g., $3-5$), its cost is several times that of a single factorization. It is clear that the cost of the analytical method is significantly lower than that of the finite-difference method. The statement is based on a false premise and its conclusion is the opposite of the truth.\n\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{ABD}\n$$", "id": "2581876"}]}
