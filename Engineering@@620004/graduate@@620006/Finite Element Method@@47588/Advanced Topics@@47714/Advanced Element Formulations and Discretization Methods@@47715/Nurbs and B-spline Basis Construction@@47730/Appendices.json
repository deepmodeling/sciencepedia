It is a standard problem in the theory of B-splines and NURBS, which are fundamental tools in computer-aided design, computer graphics, and isogeometric analysis (a branch of the finite element method). The provided data ($U$ and $p$) are complete and consistent for defining a B-spline space. The tasks are specific, formalizable, and admit a unique, verifiable solution based on established mathematical principles. No flaws are identified.\n\n**Verdict:** The problem is deemed valid.\n\nA B-spline is a piecewise polynomial function of degree $p$. The points where the polynomial pieces join are called knots. The smoothness of the spline at these knots is a critical property, determined by the multiplicity of the knots in the knot vector.\n\nFirst, we deduce the general rule for continuity. A spline function $S(u)$ of degree $p$ over a knot vector $U$ is defined as a linear combination of B-spline basis functions $N_{i,p}(u)$:\n$$ S(u) = \\sum_{i=0}^{n} C_i N_{i,p}(u) $$\nThe basis functions $N_{i,p}(u)$ are defined by the Cox-de Boor recursion formula:\n$$ N_{i,0}(u) = \\begin{cases} 1 & \\text{if } u_i \\le u < u_{i+1} \\\\ 0 & \\text{otherwise} \\end{cases} $$\n$$ N_{i,p}(u) = \\frac{u - u_i}{u_{i+p} - u_i} N_{i,p-1}(u) + \\frac{u_{i+p+1} - u}{u_{i+p+1} - u_{i+1}} N_{i+1,p-1}(u) $$\nA critical property of B-splines is the formula for the derivative of a basis function:\n$$ \\frac{d}{du} N_{i,p}(u) = p \\left( \\frac{N_{i,p-1}(u)}{u_{i+p} - u_i} - \\frac{N_{i+1,p-1}(u)}{u_{i+p+1} - u_{i+1}} \\right) $$\nThis equation shows that the derivative of a degree-$p$ B-spline basis function is a linear combination of two degree-$(p-1)$ basis functions. By extension, the derivative of a degree-$p$ spline function is a degree-$(p-1)$ spline function, defined on the same knot vector (up to a constant scaling factor).\n$$ S'(u) = \\sum_{i=0}^{n} C_i N'_{i,p}(u) = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} p \\frac{C_i - C_{i-1}}{u_{i+p} - u_i} N_{i,p-1}(u) $$\nRepeating this differentiation $k$ times, the $k$-th derivative of a degree-$p$ spline, $S^{(k)}(u)$, is a spline of degree $p-k$. This resulting spline is itself continuous. The continuity of $S^{(k)}(u)$ determines the continuity class of $S(u)$. Specifically, if $S^{(k)}(u)$ is continuous, then $S(u)$ is $C^k$ continuous.\n\nThe continuity of a spline of degree $q=p-k$ at a knot $\\xi$ with multiplicity $s$ must be analyzed. A spline of degree $q$ is guaranteed to be continuous across any knot, provided $q \\ge 0$. So, $S(u)$ is at least $C^{p-1}$ at a simple knot ($s=1$).\nHowever, knot multiplicity reduces continuity. A knot $\\xi$ of multiplicity $s$ provides fewer constraints on the polynomial segments that meet at $\\xi$. A degree-$p$ spline is $C^\\infty$ on any open interval $(u_i, u_{i+1})$ where $u_i < u_{i+1}$. At a knot $\\xi=u_j$, the two polynomial segments from $(u_{j-1}, u_j)$ and $(u_j, u_{j+1})$ are joined. For a simple knot ($s=1$), there are $p$ continuity conditions (the function value and its first $p-1$ derivatives must match), ensuring $C^{p-1}$ continuity. Each repetition of the knot removes one such constraint. Thus, a knot of multiplicity $s$ imposes only $(p+1)-s$ conditions on the derivatives. This implies that the function and its derivatives up to order $p-s$ are continuous.\nTherefore, a spline of degree $p$ is $C^{p-s}$ continuous at a knot of multiplicity $s$. The order of derivative continuity is $k = p-s$. A negative order $k=-1$ indicates a discontinuity in the function value itself ($C^{-1}$ continuity).\n\nThis result extends directly to Non-Uniform Rational B-Splines (NURBS). A NURBS curve is the projection of a higher-dimensional non-rational B-spline curve. It is defined as:\n$$ R(u) = \\frac{\\sum_{i=0}^{n} w_i P_i N_{i,p}(u)}{\\sum_{i=0}^{n} w_i N_{i,p}(u)} $$\nwhere $w_i > 0$ are weights. The numerator is a vector-valued B-spline, and the denominator is a scalar-valued B-spline. Both are of degree $p$ and defined on the same knot vector $U$. Consequently, both have $C^{p-s}$ continuity at a knot of multiplicity $s$. Since the denominator is strictly positive over the domain of interest, the rational function $R(u)$ is also $C^{p-s}$ continuous.\n\nNow, we apply this rule to the given problem.\n- **Degree:** $p=2$.\n- **Knot Vector:** $U = \\{0, 0, 0, 0.2, 0.2, 0.5, 0.7, 1, 1, 1\\}$.\n- **Unique Knots:** $\\{0, 0.2, 0.5, 0.7, 1\\}$.\n\nWe compute the multiplicity $s$ for each unique knot and then find the continuity order $k = p-s = 2-s$.\n\n1.  **Knot $\\xi_1 = 0$**:\n    The knot $0$ appears $3$ times. Thus, its multiplicity is $s_1=3$.\n    The continuity order is $k_1 = p - s_1 = 2 - 3 = -1$. This corresponds to $C^{-1}$ continuity, meaning the function is discontinuous at $u=0$. This is expected for an open knot vector where the first knot has multiplicity $p+1 = 3$.\n\n2.  **Knot $\\xi_2 = 0.2$**:\n    The knot $0.2$ appears $2$ times. Thus, its multiplicity is $s_2=2$.\n    The continuity order is $k_2 = p - s_2 = 2 - 2 = 0$. This corresponds to $C^0$ continuity. The spline is continuous at $u=0.2$, but its first derivative is not.\n\n3.  **Knot $\\xi_3 = 0.5$**:\n    The knot $0.5$ appears $1$ time. This is a simple knot, so its multiplicity is $s_3=1$.\n    The continuity order is $k_3 = p - s_3 = 2 - 1 = 1$. This corresponds to $C^1$ continuity. The spline and its first derivative are continuous at $u=0.5$.\n\n4.  **Knot $\\xi_4 = 0.7$**:\n    The knot $0.7$ appears $1$ time. This is also a simple knot, so its multiplicity is $s_4=1$.\n    The continuity order is $k_4 = p - s_4 = 2 - 1 = 1$. This corresponds to $C^1$ continuity. The spline and its first derivative are continuous at $u=0.7$.\n\n5.  **Knot $\\xi_5 = 1$**:\n    The knot $1$ appears $3$ times. Thus, its multiplicity is $s_5=3$.\n    The continuity order is $k_5 = p - s_5 = 2 - 3 = -1$. This corresponds to $C^{-1}$ continuity.

The problem statement contains no scientific or factual unsoundness, is not metaphorical, is complete, and is not trivial.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is **valid**. A solution will be constructed.\n\nWe begin by recalling the fundamental relationship between the continuity of a B-spline curve of degree $p$ at a knot and the multiplicity of that knot. For a B-spline curve defined on a knot vector $\\Xi$, if an interior knot $\\xi_i$ has a multiplicity of $k$ (i.e., it appears $k$ times consecutively in the knot vector), then the curve is at most $C^{p-k}$ continuous at that parameter value $\\xi_i$. The curve generically possesses $C^{p-1}$ continuity at any simple knot (where $k=1$).\n\nThe problem requires us to enforce specific continuity levels at two distinct interior locations, $\\xi=a$ and $\\xi=b$, for a B-spline of polynomial degree $p=4$.\n\nFirst, consider the continuity requirement at $\\xi=a$. We must enforce $C^{1}$ continuity. Let the multiplicity of the knot at $\\xi=a$ be $k_a$. Applying the continuity formula:\n$$\nC^{p-k_a} = C^{1}\n$$\nGiven the degree $p=4$, we have:\n$$\n4 - k_a = 1\n$$\nSolving for $k_a$ yields the required multiplicity at $\\xi=a$:\n$$\nk_a = 4 - 1 = 3\n$$\nThus, to achieve exactly $C^{1}$ continuity at $\\xi=a$, the knot value $a$ must be repeated $3$ times in the knot vector.\n\nSecond, consider the continuity requirement at $\\xi=b$. We must enforce $C^{0}$ continuity. Let the multiplicity of the knot at $\\xi=b$ be $k_b$. Applying the continuity formula again:\n$$\nC^{p-k_b} = C^{0}\n$$\nWith $p=4$, we have:\n$$\n4 - k_b = 0\n$$\nSolving for $k_b$ yields the required multiplicity at $\\xi=b$:\n$$\nk_b = 4 - 0 = 4\n$$\nTherefore, to achieve $C^{0}$ continuity at $\\xi=b$, the knot value $b$ must be repeated $4$ times in the knot vector.\n\nNow, we construct the shortest possible open, clamped knot vector over the domain $\\left[0,1\\right]$ that incorporates these multiplicities. An open (or clamped) knot vector for a curve of degree $p$ has the first $p+1$ knots equal to the starting parameter value and the last $p+1$ knots equal to the ending parameter value. This ensures that the B-spline curve interpolates the first and last control points.\n\nFor our case, $p=4$, and the parametric domain is $\\left[0,1\\right]$. This dictates that the knot vector must begin with $p+1=5$ knots of value $0$ and end with $p+1=5$ knots of value $1$.\n\nThe problem specifies that the only interior knots are at $\\xi=a$ and $\\xi=b$. We place the interior knots between the clamped ends, maintaining a nondecreasing sequence. The structure of the knot vector $\\Xi$ is as follows:\n1.  The first $p+1=5$ knots are $0$.\n2.  These are followed by the interior knots at $a$, with multiplicity $k_a=3$.\n3.  These are followed by the interior knots at $b$, with multiplicity $k_b=4$.\n4.  The final $p+1=5$ knots are $1$.\n\nThe condition $0 < a < b < 1$ ensures that this ordering is nondecreasing. Assembling the full knot vector, we get:\n$$\n\\Xi = \\{\\underbrace{0, 0, 0, 0, 0}_{p+1 \\text{ times}}, \\underbrace{a, a, a}_{k_a=3 \\text{ times}}, \\underbrace{b, b, b, b}_{k_b=4 \\text{ times}}, \\underbrace{1, 1, 1, 1, 1}_{p+1 \\text{ times}}\\}\n$$\n\nFinally, we specialize this general form to the concrete values provided: $a = \\frac{1}{4}$ and $b = \\frac{3}{4}$. Substituting these into the knot vector structure gives:\n$$\n\\Xi = \\left\\{0, 0, 0, 0, 0, \\frac{1}{4}, \\frac{1}{4}, \\frac{1}{4}, \\frac{3}{4}, \\frac{3}{4}, \\frac{3}{4}, \\frac{3}{4}, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1\\right\\}\n$$\nThis is the shortest open, clamped knot vector of degree $p=4$ on $\\left[0,1\\right]$ that has $C^{1}$ continuity at $\\xi=\\frac{1}{4}$ and $C^{0}$ continuity at $\\xi=\\frac{3}{4}$, using only these two values as interior knots.\nThe total number of knots is $m+1 = 5 + 3 + 4 + 5 = 17$.
