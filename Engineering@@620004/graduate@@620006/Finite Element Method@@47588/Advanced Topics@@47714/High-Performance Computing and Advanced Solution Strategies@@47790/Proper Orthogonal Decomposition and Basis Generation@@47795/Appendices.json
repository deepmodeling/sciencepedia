The columns of $\\Phi$ are the eigenvectors, and the diagonal elements of $\\Lambda$ are the corresponding eigenvalues that maximize the objective function. It is a standard result that the maximum is achieved when the eigenvalues in $\\Lambda$ are the $r$ largest eigenvalues.\n\nThis eigenvalue problem is posed in the high-dimensional space $\\mathbb{R}^n$ (matrix size $n \\times n$). For practical computations where typically $n \\gg m$, it is advantageous to reduce it to an equivalent problem in the smaller snapshot space $\\mathbb{R}^m$. This is known as the method of snapshots.\nLet $\\phi_i$ be the $i$-th column of $\\Phi$ and $\\lambda_i$ the $i$-th diagonal element of $\\Lambda$. The equation for a single mode is:\n$$\nX X^{\\top} M \\phi_i = \\lambda_i \\phi_i\n$$\nAssuming $\\lambda_i > 0$ as required by the problem, we can pre-multiply by $X^{\\top} M$:\n$$\n(X^{\\top} M X) (X^{\\top} M \\phi_i) = \\lambda_i (X^{\\top} M \\phi_i)\n$$\nLet us define the snapshot correlation matrix $C_m = X^{\\top} M X \\in \\mathbb{R}^{m \\times m}$ and a new vector $v_i = X^{\\top} M \\phi_i \\in \\mathbb{R}^m$. The equation transforms into:\n$$\nC_m v_i = \\lambda_i v_i\n$$\nThis is a standard symmetric eigenvalue problem in $\\mathbb{R}^m$, since $C_m^{\\top} = (X^{\\top} M X)^{\\top} = X^{\\top} M^{\\top} X = X^{\\top} M X = C_m$. We solve this smaller problem for its $r$ largest eigenvalues $\\lambda_i$ and corresponding eigenvectors $v_i$. Let $V \\in \\mathbb{R}^{m \\times r}$ be the matrix whose columns are the eigenvectors $v_i$, and $\\Lambda \\in \\mathbb{R}^{r \\times r}$ be the diagonal matrix of eigenvalues $\\lambda_i$. Because $C_m$ is symmetric, we can choose the eigenvectors to be orthonormal, such that $V^{\\top} V = I_r$.\n\nThe final step is to construct the POD modes $\\phi_i$ from the computed eigenvectors $v_i$. From the original eigenvalue equation $X X^{\\top} M \\phi_i = \\lambda_i \\phi_i$, we can see that $\\phi_i$ must lie in the span of the columns of $X$. We can express $\\phi_i$ as a linear combination of the snapshots, but a more direct route is to use the relation $X v_i = X (X^{\\top} M \\phi_i) = \\lambda_i \\phi_i$. This gives a formula for $\\phi_i$:\n$$\n\\phi_i = \\frac{1}{\\lambda_i} X v_i\n$$\nWe must now enforce the $M$-orthonormality constraint, $(\\phi_i, \\phi_j)_M = \\delta_{ij}$, to find the correct scaling. Let us use a general scaling constant $c_i$ for each mode, $\\phi_i = c_i X v_i$.\n$$\n\\phi_i^{\\top} M \\phi_j = (c_i X v_i)^{\\top} M (c_j X v_j) = c_i c_j v_i^{\\top} (X^{\\top} M X) v_j = c_i c_j v_i^{\\top} C_m v_j\n$$\nSince $v_j$ is an eigenvector of $C_m$ with eigenvalue $\\lambda_j$, we have $C_m v_j = \\lambda_j v_j$.\n$$\n\\phi_i^{\\top} M \\phi_j = c_i c_j v_i^{\\top} (\\lambda_j v_j) = c_i c_j \\lambda_j v_i^{\\top} v_j\n$$\nUsing the orthonormality of the eigenvectors, $v_i^{\\top} v_j = \\delta_{ij}$, the expression becomes:\n$$\n\\phi_i^{\\top} M \\phi_j = c_i c_j \\lambda_j \\delta_{ij}\n$$\nFor this to equal $\\delta_{ij}$, we must have $c_i^2 \\lambda_i = 1$ for $i=j$, which implies $c_i = 1/\\sqrt{\\lambda_i}$ (taking the positive root).\nThus, the correctly normalized $M$-orthonormal POD modes are given by:\n$$\n\\phi_i = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\lambda_i}} X v_i\n$$\nThis constructive expression can be written in matrix form. Let $\\Lambda^{-1/2}$ be the diagonal matrix with entries $1/\\sqrt{\\lambda_i}$.

This first mode, capturing almost all energy, simply represents the mean field $\\bar{u}$. This is a well-known effect where a large mean biases the POD analysis. Centering removes this mean, so the analysis of $X_c$ concerns only the fluctuations $v_i$. The total energy of $X_c$, $\\lVert X_c \\rVert_F^2 = \\sum_j \\tilde{\\sigma}_j^2$, represents the total variance of the snapshots. Consequently, $\\tilde{E}_1 = \\tilde{\\sigma}_1^2 / \\sum_j \\tilde{\\sigma}_j^2$ correctly quantifies the fraction of the total variance captured by the most energetic fluctuation mode. All parts of the statement are consistent with the principles of POD.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**C. Centering increases all singular values by the same constant amount, so relative energy fractions such as $E_1$ are unchanged by centering.**\nThis statement is false. The relationship $\\sigma_j^2 \\ge \\tilde{\\sigma}_j^2$ does not imply a constant shift. For instance, in the case from option B where the mean is dominant, $\\sigma_1^2 \\approx m\\lVert \\bar{u} \\rVert_2^2 + \\tilde{\\sigma}_j^2$ (for some j, a more detailed analysis is required) and is much larger than $\\tilde{\\sigma}_1^2$, while other $\\sigma_k^2$ might be closer to their centered counterparts $\\tilde{\\sigma}_k^2$. So the change is not a constant shift. Furthermore, even if $\\sigma_j = \\tilde{\\sigma}_j + c$ for some constant $c>0$, the energy fractions would change: $E_1 = (\\tilde{\\sigma}_1+c)^2 / \\sum_j (\\tilde{\\sigma}_j+c)^2$ is not equal to $\\tilde{E}_1 = \\tilde{\\sigma}_1^2 / \\sum_j \\tilde{\\sigma}_j^2$ in general.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D.

The sample covariance matrix is $S_m = \\frac{1}{m-1} \\sum_{i=1}^m (u_i - \\bar{u})(u_i - \\bar{u})^\\top = \\frac{1}{m-1} X_c X_c^\\top$. For large $m$, this is well approximated by $\\frac{1}{m} X_c X_c^\\top$. As $m \\to \\infty$, this converges to the true covariance matrix of the process, $C = E[(U - E[U])(U - E[U])^\\top]$. So the first part is correct.\nWe derived $XX^\\top = X_c X_c^\\top + m \\bar{u}\\bar{u}^\\top$, so $\\frac{1}{m}XX^\\top = \\frac{1}{m}X_c X_c^\\top + \\bar{u}\\bar{u}^\\top$. As $m \\to \\infty$, $\\bar{u}$ converges to the process mean $\\mu = E[U]$, and $\\frac{1}{m}X_c X_c^\\top$ converges to $C$. Thus, $\\frac{1}{m}XX^\\top$ converges to $C + \\mu\\mu^\\top$, which is the covariance matrix plus a rank-one term related to the mean.\n\"Variance\" is by definition a measure of spread around the mean. The total variance is $\\text{Tr}(C)$. The eigenvalues of $C$ (approximated by $\\frac{1}{m}\\tilde{\\sigma}_j^2$) partition this total variance. Therefore, the fraction of variance explained by the $j$-th mode is correctly given by the analysis of the centered data: $\\tilde{\\sigma}_j^2 / \\sum_k \\tilde{\\sigma}_k^2$. The analysis of the uncentered data matrix $X$ mixes the effects of variance and the mean. Its leading singular value is often dominated by the mean, as seen in option B. Therefore, interpreting the energy fractions from uncentered data, $E_j$, as \"fraction of variance\" is incorrect. This interpretation is only valid for the centered data.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**E.

In matrix form, this is $\\bar{u}^\\top X_c = 0$. This implies $\\bar{u}$ is orthogonal to the column space of $X_c$. The eigenvectors of $X_c X_c^\\top$ corresponding to non-zero eigenvalues (i.e., the left singular vectors of $X_c$) span this column space. So, $\\bar{u}$ is orthogonal to all such eigenvectors $\\tilde{\\phi}_j$.\nConsider the action of $XX^\\top$ on such an eigenvector $\\tilde{\\phi}_j$:\n$XX^\\top \\tilde{\\phi}_j = (X_c X_c^\\top + m\\bar{u}\\bar{u}^\\top)\\tilde{\\phi}_j = X_c X_c^\\top \\tilde{\\phi}_j + m\\bar{u}(\\bar{u}^\\top \\tilde{\\phi}_j)$.\nSince $\\bar{u}^\\top \\tilde{\\phi}_j = 0$, this simplifies to $XX^\\top \\tilde{\\phi}_j = \\tilde{\\sigma}_j^2 \\tilde{\\phi}_j$. So, the eigenvectors of $X_c X_c^\\top$ are also eigenvectors of $XX^\\top$ with identical eigenvalues $\\tilde{\\sigma}_j^2$.\nNow consider the vector $\\bar{u}$ itself. It is in the null space of $X_c^\\top$, so it is in the null space of $X_c X_c^\\top$: $X_c X_c^\\top \\bar{u} = X_c (X_c^\\top \\bar{u}) = X_c (0) = 0$.\nNow apply $XX^\\top$ to $\\bar{u}$:\n$XX^\\top \\bar{u} = (X_c X_c^\\top + m\\bar{u}\\bar{u}^\\top)\\bar{u} = X_c X_c^\\top \\bar{u} + m\\bar{u}(\\bar{u}^\\top \\bar{u}) = 0 + m\\lVert \\bar{u} \\rVert_2^2 \\bar{u}$.\nThis shows that $\\bar{u}$ is an eigenvector of $XX^\\top$ with eigenvalue $m\\lVert \\bar{u} \\rVert_2^2$.\nThe set of eigenvalues of $XX^\\top$ is therefore $\\{\\tilde{\\sigma}_j^2\\} \\cup \\{m\\lVert \\bar{u} \\rVert_2^2\\}$.\nThe largest eigenvalue of $XX^\\top$ is $\\sigma_1^2 = \\max(\\tilde{\\sigma}_1^2, m\\lVert \\bar{u} \\rVert_2^2)$.\nThe statement claims $\\sigma_1$ is unchanged, which means $\\sigma_1 = \\tilde{\\sigma}_1$. This is only true if $\\sigma_1^2 = \\tilde{\\sigma}_1^2$, which requires $m\\lVert \\bar{u} \\rVert_2^2 \\le \\tilde{\\sigma}_1^2$. This is an additional condition not provided in the premise. If $m\\lVert \\bar{u} \\rVert_2^2 > \\tilde{\\sigma}_1^2$, then $\\sigma_1^2 = m\\lVert \\bar{u} \\rVert_2^2 \\neq \\tilde{\\sigma}_1^2$, so $\\sigma_1$ is changed.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{BD}$$", "id": "2591529"}, {"introduction": "Real-world data is invariably contaminated with measurement or numerical noise, which poses a significant challenge for model reduction.

It presents a standard model from high-dimensional statistics and random matrix theory, known as the \"spiked covariance matrix model\" or \"deformed Wigner/Wishart ensemble.\" The setup—a low-rank signal matrix perturbed by an additive white noise matrix—is a canonical problem in signal processing, machine learning, and model order reduction. The assumptions about the noise (i.i.d. entries, finite moments) and the asymptotic regime ($N, M \\to \\infty$ with $N/M \\to \\gamma$) are standard for invoking results from random matrix theory, specifically the Marchenko–Pastur law, which governs the spectrum of sample covariance matrices. The question is objective and asks for an evaluation of different statistical procedures based on their asymptotic consistency, a well-defined mathematical property. The problem is self-contained and provides all necessary information to proceed with a rigorous analysis.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem statement is valid. I will proceed to derive the solution.\n\n### Derivation and Option Analysis\nThe core of the problem lies in understanding the spectrum of the sample covariance matrix $C = \\frac{1}{M}\\tilde{X}\\tilde{X}^\\top$. We substitute $\\tilde{X} = X + E$:\n$$C = \\frac{1}{M}(X+E)(X+E)^\\top = \\frac{1}{M}XX^\\top + \\frac{1}{M}EE^\\top + \\frac{1}{M}(XE^\\top + EX^\\top)$$\nThe matrix $X$ is low-rank, $rank(X) = r_\\star$. Its corresponding covariance component, $\\frac{1}{M}XX^\\top$, is also a rank-$r_\\star$ matrix. The noise component is $C_E = \\frac{1}{M}EE^\\top$. The cross-terms, under the specified assumptions of independence and large dimensions, have a spectrally negligible contribution compared to the two principal terms.\n\nThe problem thus reduces to the analysis of a \"spiked\" random matrix, $C \\approx \\frac{1}{M}XX^\\top + C_E$. According to random matrix theory, specifically the Marchenko–Pastur law, the eigenvalues of a large sample covariance matrix of white noise, $C_E$, are not scattered randomly. For a noise matrix $E$ with i.i.d. entries of mean $0$ and variance $\\eta^2$, in the limit $N, M \\to \\infty$ with $N/M \\to \\gamma$, the empirical distribution of the eigenvalues of $C_E$ converges to a deterministic probability distribution with a compact support given by the interval $[\\lambda_-, \\lambda_+]$, where:\n$$ \\lambda_\\pm = \\eta^2 (1 \\pm \\sqrt{\\gamma})^2 $$\nThis continuous spectrum of eigenvalues is called the \"bulk.\" The eigenvalues of the signal component $\\frac{1}{M}XX^\\top$ are related to the singular values of $X$. If these signal eigenvalues are sufficiently large, they will appear as discrete eigenvalues, or \"spikes,\" lying outside the noise bulk. Specifically, a signal eigenvalue $\\lambda_{signal}$ will produce a spike in the spectrum of $C$ if $\\lambda_{signal} > \\eta^2\\sqrt{\\gamma}$. The location of this spike will be outside the bulk edge $\\lambda_+$.\n\nThe eigenvalues of $C$ are related to the singular values $\\sigma_k$ of $\\tilde{X}$ by $\\lambda_k(C) = \\sigma_k^2 / M$. Therefore, the noise bulk for the squared singular values, $\\sigma_k^2$, is contained in the interval $[M\\lambda_-, M\\lambda_+]$. The upper edge of this noise bulk corresponds to a singular value threshold $\\sigma_{threshold}$:\n$$ \\sigma_{threshold}^2 = M\\lambda_+ = M\\eta^2 (1+\\sqrt{\\gamma})^2 $$\n$$ \\sigma_{threshold} = \\eta\\sqrt{M}\\,(1+\\sqrt{\\gamma}) $$\nA truncation rule is consistent if and only if it can asymptotically distinguish the $r_\\star$ singular values corresponding to the signal spikes from the $\\min(N,M) - r_\\star$ singular values belonging to the noise bulk. This requires a threshold that converges to $\\sigma_{threshold}$. We now evaluate each option against this principle.\n\n**A. Elbow heuristic: choose $r$ as the first index $k$ for which $\\sigma_{k+1}/\\sigma_k < 0.5$, i.e., where a visually prominent “elbow” occurs in the scree plot.**\nThis is a heuristic method that lacks a theoretical foundation for consistency. The size of the spectral gap between the last signal spike $\\sigma_{r_\\star}$ and the first noise singular value $\\sigma_{r_\\star+1}$ is not guaranteed to produce a ratio that falls below a fixed, arbitrary constant like $0.5$. The behavior of singular values near the edge of the bulk is described by Tracy-Widom distributions, and the spacing does not obey such a simple rule. This method is not based on the asymptotic theory of the noise spectrum and is therefore not robust or consistent.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**B. Robust noise-floor truncation using the upper bulk edge: estimate $\\hat{\\eta}^2$ from the empirical median of $\\{\\sigma_k^2/M\\}$ over the lower half of the spectrum by dividing by the known median of the limiting Marchenko–Pastur distribution for aspect ratio $\\gamma$, then set a threshold $\\tau = \\hat{\\eta}\\sqrt{M}\\,(1+\\sqrt{\\gamma})$ and keep all modes with $\\sigma_k > \\tau$.**\nThis method directly implements the theoretically correct approach.\n1. It identifies the correct form of the threshold, $\\tau = \\eta\\sqrt{M}(1+\\sqrt{\\gamma})$, which corresponds to the upper edge of the Marchenko–Pastur bulk.\n2. It proposes a statistically robust method to estimate the unknown noise variance $\\eta^2$. Using the median of the empirical distribution of eigenvalues ($\\sigma_k^2/M$) from the lower part of the spectrum is robust because these eigenvalues are unaffected by the signal spikes, which are at the upper end of the spectrum. The median is also less sensitive to fluctuations at the spectral edges than the mean.\n3. Given a consistent estimator $\\hat{\\eta}^2$ for $\\eta^2$, the threshold $\\tau = \\hat{\\eta}\\sqrt{M}\\,(1+\\sqrt{\\gamma})$ is a consistent estimator for the true spectral boundary. As $N,M \\to \\infty$, this method will correctly separate the $r_\\star$ spikes from the bulk with probability approaching $1$.\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\n**C. Fixed energy criterion: choose the smallest $r$ such that $\\sum_{k=1}^r \\sigma_k^2 \\ge 0.99 \\sum_{k=1}^{\\min(N,M)} \\sigma_k^2$.**\nThis criterion is widely used but is inconsistent in the presence of non-negligible noise, especially in high dimensions. The total \"energy,\" or squared Frobenius norm, is $\\sum \\sigma_k^2 = ||\\tilde{X}||_F^2 = ||X+E||_F^2$. By the law of large numbers, $||E||_F^2 \\approx NM\\eta^2$. The signal energy is $||X||_F^2$. The total energy is dominated by the noise contribution if $NM\\eta^2$ is large. To capture a fixed fraction (e.g., $99\\%$) of this total energy, one might need to include a significant number of noise modes, as each contributes to the sum. The resulting rank $r$ would depend heavily on the noise level $\\eta^2$ and the dimensions $N, M$, rather than reflecting the intrinsic rank $r_\\star$ of the signal. This method does not separate signal from noise and will systematically overestimate the rank.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. Naive debiasing threshold: estimate $\\hat{\\eta}^2$ by averaging $\\{\\sigma_k^2/M\\}$ over the lower half of the spectrum and set $r$ as the number of indices with $\\sigma_k^2 - \\hat{\\eta}^2 M > 0$ (equivalently, $\\sigma_k > \\hat{\\eta}\\sqrt{M}$).**\nThis method sets a threshold for the eigenvalues of $C$ at $\\hat{\\eta}^2$. The mean of the Marchenko–Pastur eigenvalue distribution is exactly $\\eta^2$. By setting the threshold at the mean of the noise distribution, this rule will classify all noise eigenvalues greater than the mean as signal. In general, for $\\gamma>0$, the Marchenko–Pastur distribution is skewed, but approximately half of the noise eigenvalues will lie above the mean. Thus, this method will catastrophically overestimate the rank by including a macroscopic fraction of the noise modes. The correct threshold is the upper edge of the bulk, $\\eta^2(1+\\sqrt{\\gamma})^2$, which is strictly greater than the mean $\\eta^2$ for any $\\gamma>0$.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**E. Adaptive bulk-fit truncation: fit a Marchenko–Pastur distribution to the empirical distribution of $\\{\\sigma_k^2/M\\}$ restricted to indices $k \\ge k_0$ for some $k_0 \\gg r_\\star$ so as to jointly estimate $\\hat{\\gamma}$ and $\\hat{\\eta}^2$, then define $r$ as the number of singular values exceeding the fitted upper bulk edge $\\hat{\\eta}^2\\,(1+\\sqrt{\\hat{\\gamma}})^2$ (equivalently, $\\sigma_k > \\hat{\\eta}\\sqrt{M}\\,(1+\\sqrt{\\hat{\\gamma}})$).**\nThis is a more sophisticated and powerful variant of method B. It is based on the same correct principle: thresholding at the upper edge of the noise bulk.\n1. The method correctly identifies the noise-only part of the spectrum (eigenvalues for $k \\ge k_0 \\gg r_\\star$) to avoid contamination from signal spikes.\n2. It performs a statistical fit of the theoretical Marchenko–Pastur distribution to this empirical data. This allows for joint estimation of both the noise variance $\\eta^2$ and the aspect ratio $\\gamma$. This \"adaptive\" nature makes the method more robust in practical scenarios where the true aspect ratio might not be known precisely.\n3. It then constructs the threshold using these estimated parameters, $\\hat{\\tau} = \\hat{\\eta}\\sqrt{M}\\,(1+\\sqrt{\\hat{\\gamma}})$. This is a consistent estimator of the true spectral edge.\nThis procedure is a standard and state-of-the-art technique for rank estimation in spiked models and is provably consistent under the problem's assumptions.\nVerdict: **Correct**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{BE}$$", "id": "2591551"}]}
