Initialize a variable `current_min_lambda` to a large positive number.\n2. Iterate through all integer mode degrees $\\ell$ from $0$ to $L=8$.\n3. In each iteration, calculate $v_{\\ell} = \\frac{1}{2\\ell + 1}$.\n4. Calculate the smallest eigenvalue for that mode, $\\lambda_{\\min}(K_{\\ell}(\\gamma))$, using the provided formula.\n5. Update `current_min_lambda = min(current_min_lambda, \\lambda_{\\min}(K_{\\ell}(\\gamma)))$.\n6. After iterating through all $\\ell$, the final value of `current_min_lambda` is the result $\\lambda_{\\min}^{(8)}(\\gamma)$.\nThis procedure is implemented in the provided program.", "answer": "$$[-0.61803399,-0.57323868,-0.17421562,0.00000000,0.00000000,0.00549424,0.02701121]$$", "id": "2551171"}]}
