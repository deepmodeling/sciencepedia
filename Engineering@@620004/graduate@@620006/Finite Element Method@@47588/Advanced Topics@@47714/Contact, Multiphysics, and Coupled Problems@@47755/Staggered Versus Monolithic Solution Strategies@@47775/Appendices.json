When a structure accelerates through a fluid, it must displace the fluid, which in turn exerts an inertial force back on the structure. This exercise guides you through a first-principles derivation of this 'added mass' effect, starting from the basic conservation laws for a simple fluid-structure interaction (FSI) model [@problem_id:2598435]. Understanding how to quantify this added mass is a critical first step in analyzing the stability and performance of partitioned FSI algorithms.", "problem": "Consider a one-dimensional fluid-structure interaction model in which a rigid, frictionless piston at position $x=0$ is attached to a linear elastic structure and pushes an inviscid fluid that fills a straight, rigid tube of constant cross-sectional area $A$ over the interval $x \\in [0,L]$. The far end at $x=L$ opens into a large reservoir maintained at zero gauge pressure. The fluid has uniform density $\\rho$, and the motion is confined to the axial direction. Assume small motions, negligible gravity, and that the fluid behaves as incompressible over the time scales of interest. The piston has displacement $u_{s}(t)$ and, by continuity, the fluid has axial velocity field $v(x,t)$. The fluid exerts a net force on the piston equal to the pressure at $x=0$ times the area $A$. \n\nWithin the finite element method (FEM) context for fluid-structure interaction (FSI), it is known that the so-called added-mass effect controls the stability of staggered (partitioned) versus monolithic (fully coupled) solution strategies.

The model presented is a standard, simplified representation used to study the fundamentals of FSI, particularly the added-mass effect. The problem is well-posed, providing all necessary physical laws, boundary conditions, and geometric parameters to arrive at a unique solution. The language is objective and precise. The problem is directly relevant to the stated topic of solution strategies in computational FSI. It does not exhibit any characteristics of an invalid problem such as scientific unsoundness, missing information, or ambiguity.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. A complete derivation will be provided.\n\nThe derivation begins with the governing equations for the fluid.\n\nFirst, we consider the conservation of mass. For a one-dimensional, incompressible fluid flowing in a tube of constant cross-sectional area $A$, the continuity equation is:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial x} = 0 $$\nwhere $v(x,t)$ is the axial fluid velocity. This equation implies that the velocity $v$ is not a function of the spatial coordinate $x$ and can only depend on time $t$. We may write $v(x,t) = v(t)$.\n\nNext, we apply the kinematic boundary condition at the interface between the piston and the fluid. For small motions, this condition is applied at the mean piston position, $x=0$. The fluid velocity at this point must match the piston's velocity, which is the time derivative of its displacement, $\\dot{u}_s(t)$.\n$$ v(0,t) = \\frac{d u_s}{d t} = \\dot{u}_s(t) $$\nCombining this with the result from the continuity equation, we conclude that the velocity of the entire fluid column is uniform in space and equal to the piston's velocity:\n$$ v(x,t) = \\dot{u}_s(t) \\quad \\text{for all } x \\in [0,L] $$\n\nNow, we consider the conservation of linear momentum. For an inviscid fluid with negligible body forces (gravity is ignored), the one-dimensional Euler momentum equation is:\n$$ \\rho \\left( \\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial t} + v \\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial x} \\right) = - \\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial x} $$\nwhere $p(x,t)$ is the fluid pressure. From the continuity equation, we know $\\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial x} = 0$. The momentum equation simplifies to:\n$$ \\rho \\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial t} = - \\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial x} $$\nThe time derivative of the fluid velocity is the fluid acceleration, which is equal to the piston's acceleration:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial t} = \\frac{d}{dt} \\left( \\dot{u}_s(t) \\right) = \\ddot{u}_s(t) $$\nSubstituting this into the simplified Euler equation gives the relationship between the pressure gradient and the piston's acceleration:\n$$ \\rho \\ddot{u}_s(t) = - \\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial x} $$\nSince the left-hand side is a function of time only, we can integrate this equation with respect to the spatial coordinate $x$ to find the pressure distribution $p(x,t)$:\n$$ p(x,t) = \\int - \\rho \\ddot{u}_s(t) \\, dx = - \\rho \\ddot{u}_s(t) x + C(t) $$\nwhere $C(t)$ is an integration constant that may depend on time. We identify $C(t)$ by evaluating the expression at $x=0$, which gives $C(t) = p(0,t)$. Thus, the pressure distribution is:\n$$ p(x,t) = p(0,t) - \\rho x \\ddot{u}_s(t) $$\nThis shows a linear pressure drop along the tube length, driven by the fluid's inertia.\n\nTo determine the pressure at the piston face, $p(0,t)$, we apply the pressure boundary condition at the tube outlet, $x=L$. The problem states that the gauge pressure here is zero, so $p(L,t) = 0$. Substituting this into our pressure distribution equation:\n$$ 0 = p(L,t) = p(0,t) - \\rho L \\ddot{u}_s(t) $$\nSolving for $p(0,t)$, we find:\n$$ p(0,t) = \\rho L \\ddot{u}_s(t) $$\nThe force exerted by the fluid on the piston, $F_{fluid}$, is the pressure at the piston face multiplied by the area $A$. This force acts in the negative $x$-direction, opposing the acceleration.\n$$ F_{fluid}(t) = -p(0,t) A $$\nSubstituting our expression for $p(0,t)$:\n$$ F_{fluid}(t) = - \\left( \\rho L \\ddot{u}_s(t) \\right) A = - (\\rho A L) \\ddot{u}_s(t) $$\nThe equation of motion for the piston (the \"structure\" with mass $m_s$) is of the form $m_s \\ddot{u}_s(t) + \\dots = F_{fluid}(t)$. In a monolithic formulation, the fluid force is treated as an inertial term coupled to the structure. Substituting the expression for $F_{fluid}(t)$:\n$$ m_s \\ddot{u}_s(t) + \\dots = - (\\rho A L) \\ddot{u}_s(t) $$\nMoving the fluid force term to the left-hand side yields:\n$$ m_s \\ddot{u}_s(t) + (\\rho A L) \\ddot{u}_s(t) + \\dots = 0 $$\n$$ \\left(m_s + \\rho A L\\right) \\ddot{u}_s(t) + \\dots = 0 $$\nThe term multiplying the structural acceleration, $\\ddot{u}_s(t)$, represents the total effective inertia of the coupled system. The term $\\rho A L$ is the contribution from the fluid, which augments the structural mass $m_s$. This is, by definition, the added mass $m_a$.\nThe quantity $\\rho A L$ is the total mass of the fluid in the tube. This result is physically correct: under the given assumptions of an incompressible fluid in a rigid tube, the entire fluid column must accelerate as a single rigid body with the piston.\n\nTherefore, the effective added mass is the total mass of the fluid.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\rho A L}\n$$", "id": "2598435"}, {"introduction": "Staggered schemes are appealing for their implementation simplicity, but this simplicity can come at a great cost.

The domain is the interval $\\Omega = [0,1]$. The unknowns are the solid displacement $u(x,t)$ and the pore pressure $p(x,t)$. The strong form of the quasi-static equations is given as:\nBalance of momentum: $E \\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial x^2} - \\alpha \\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial x} = 0$ for $x \\in (0,1)$.\nFluid mass conservation: $s \\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial t} + \\alpha \\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial x \\partial t} = w$.\n\nLet $V$ be the space of test functions for displacement, and $Q$ be the space for pressure test functions.

The traction-free condition means the total stress $\\sigma = E \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x} - \\alpha p$ is zero at $x=1$. Test functions for displacement must satisfy the essential boundary condition, so $v(0)=0$.

The mechanical equilibrium equation is enforced at time $t^{n+1}$ using the contemporaneously computed temperature $\\theta^{n+1}$:\n$$\nk\\,(u^{n+1}_{\\mathrm{mono}} - \\alpha\\,\\theta^{n+1}) = 0\n$$\nGiven that the stiffness $k > 0$, this implies that the mechanical degree of freedom for the monolithic scheme is:\n$$\nu^{n+1}_{\\mathrm{mono}} = \\alpha\\,\\theta^{n+1}\n$$\nThis result physically corresponds to a state of mechanical relaxation with respect to the final temperature $\\theta^{n+1}$.\n\nNext, consider the loosely coupled staggered solution strategy. After the thermal update provides $\\theta^{n+1}$, the mechanical equilibrium is enforced using the lagged temperature from time $t^{n}$:\n$$\nk\\,(u^{n+1}_{\\mathrm{stag}} - \\alpha\\,\\theta^{n}) = 0\n$$\nAgain, since $k > 0$, this implies:\n$$\nu^{n+1}_{\\mathrm{stag}} = \\alpha\\,\\theta^{n}\n$$\nThis shows that the mechanical state is out of equilibrium with the final temperature $\\theta^{n+1}$, instead being relaxed with respect to the initial temperature $\\theta^n$.\n\nNow we evaluate the Helmholtz free energy, $\\Psi(u,\\theta) = \\frac{1}{2}\\,k\\,(u - \\alpha\\,\\theta)^{2} + \\frac{1}{2}\\,\\eta\\,\\theta^{2}$, for both final states. The thermal degree of freedom is $\\theta^{n+1}$ in both cases.\n\nFor the monolithic scheme, the final state is $(u^{n+1}_{\\mathrm{mono}}, \\theta^{n+1})$. The free energy is:\n$$\n\\Psi(u^{n+1}_{\\mathrm{mono}},\\theta^{n+1}) = \\Psi(\\alpha\\,\\theta^{n+1}, \\theta^{n+1}) = \\frac{1}{2}\\,k\\,(\\alpha\\,\\theta^{n+1} - \\alpha\\,\\theta^{n+1})^{2} + \\frac{1}{2}\\,\\eta\\,(\\theta^{n+1})^{2}\n$$\nThe first term vanishes, yielding:\n$$\n\\Psi(u^{n+1}_{\\mathrm{mono}},\\theta^{n+1}) = \\frac{1}{2}\\,\\eta\\,(\\theta^{n+1})^{2}\n$$\nThis represents the energy of the system when it is fully mechanically relaxed at the temperature $\\theta^{n+1}$.\n\nFor the staggered scheme, the final state is $(u^{n+1}_{\\mathrm{stag}}, \\theta^{n+1})$. The free energy is:\n$$\n\\Psi(u^{n+1}_{\\mathrm{stag}},\\theta^{n+1}) = \\Psi(\\alpha\\,\\theta^{n}, \\theta^{n+1}) = \\frac{1}{2}\\,k\\,(\\alpha\\,\\theta^{n} - \\alpha\\,\\theta^{n+1})^{2} + \\frac{1}{2}\\,\\eta\\,(\\theta^{n+1})^{2}\n$$\nThis state contains both mechanical strain energy (due to the lag) and thermal energy.\n\nWe can now compute the spurious energy growth $\\Delta E_{\\mathrm{spur}}$ by taking the difference:\n$$\n\\Delta E_{\\mathrm{spur}} = \\Psi(u^{n+1}_{\\mathrm{stag}},\\theta^{n+1}) - \\Psi(u^{n+1}_{\\mathrm{mono}},\\theta^{n+1})\n$$\n$$\n\\Delta E_{\\mathrm{spur}} = \\left[ \\frac{1}{2}\\,k\\,(\\alpha\\,\\theta^{n} - \\alpha\\,\\theta^{n+1})^{2} + \\frac{1}{2}\\,\\eta\\,(\\theta^{n+1})^{2} \\right] - \\left[ \\frac{1}{2}\\,\\eta\\,(\\theta^{n+1})^{2} \\right]\n$$\nThe thermal energy terms, $\\frac{1}{2}\\,\\eta\\,(\\theta^{n+1})^{2}$, cancel out, leaving:\n$$\n\\Delta E_{\\mathrm{spur}} = \\frac{1}{2}\\,k\\,(\\alpha\\,\\theta^{n} - \\alpha\\,\\theta^{n+1})^{2}\n$$\nThe problem asks for this expression in terms of the lagging error $\\delta\\theta := \\theta^{n} - \\theta^{n+1}$. We can factor $\\alpha$ from the squared term:\n$$\n\\Delta E_{\\mathrm{spur}} = \\frac{1}{2}\\,k\\,\\alpha^{2}\\,(\\theta^{n} - \\theta^{n+1})^{2}\n$$\nSubstituting the definition of $\\delta\\theta$:\n$$\n\\Delta E_{\\mathrm{spur}} = \\frac{1}{2}\\,k\\,\\alpha^{2}\\,(\\delta\\theta)^{2}\n$$\nSince $k > 0$ and $\\alpha \\neq 0$, the term $\\frac{1}{2}\\,k\\,\\alpha^{2}$ is strictly positive. The term $(\\delta\\theta)^{2}$ is non-negative. For any non-trivial thermal evolution where $\\theta^{n} \\neq \\theta^{n+1}$, we have $\\delta\\theta \\neq 0$, and therefore $\\Delta E_{\\mathrm{spur}} > 0$. This demonstrates that the staggered scheme spuriously injects mechanical energy into the system at each time step due to the time lag in the coupling term, despite the underlying thermal physics being dissipative. This unphysical energy growth is a well-known artifact of such explicit coupling schemes and can lead to numerical instability. The monolithic scheme, by contrast, correctly finds the minimum energy state for the given temperature and is thus unconditionally stable in this regard.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\frac{1}{2}\\,k\\,\\alpha^{2}\\,(\\delta\\theta)^{2}}\n$$", "id": "2598449"}]}
