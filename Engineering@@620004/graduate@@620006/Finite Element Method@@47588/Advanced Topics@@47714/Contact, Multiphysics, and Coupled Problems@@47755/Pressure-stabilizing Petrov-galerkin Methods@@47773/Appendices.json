Let us investigate the space of these divergence pairs. The space $V_h$ is the space of continuous, piecewise linear vector fields, typically built from nodal basis functions (hat functions). We can choose specific $v_h \\in V_h$ to demonstrate that the pair $(D_1, D_2)$ can be any vector in $\\mathbb{R}^2$. For instance, consider a vector field $v_h = (\\phi_{(h,0)}, 0)$, where $\\phi_{(h,0)}$ is the continuous, piecewise linear basis function that is equal to $1$ at the node $(h,0)$ and $0$ at all other nodes.\nOn triangle $K_1 = \\operatorname{conv}\\{(0,0),(h,0),(h,h)\\}$, the function $\\phi_{(h,0)}$ is given by $\\phi_{(h,0)}(x,y) = \\frac{x-y}{h}$ (based on its nodal values $0, 1, 0$ at the respective vertices). The divergence is $D_1 = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} \\left(\\frac{x-y}{h}\\right) = \\frac{1}{h}$.\nOn triangle $K_2 = \\operatorname{conv}\\{(0,0),(h,h),(0,h)\\}$, the function $\\phi_{(h,0)}$ is identically zero as all its nodal values on this triangle are $0$. Thus, $D_2 = 0$. This choice of $v_h$ generates the divergence pair $(\\frac{1}{h}, 0)$.\nSimilarly, considering $v_h = (0, \\phi_{(0,h)})$, one can show that this generates a divergence pair $(0, \\frac{1}{h})$. Since the mapping from $v_h$ to $(D_1, D_2)$ is linear, and we have found two linearly independent vectors in the image, the image is all of $\\mathbb{R}^2$.\nTherefore, for the equation $D_1 \\int_{K_1} p_h^c \\, \\mathrm{d}x + D_2 \\int_{K_2} p_h^c \\, \\mathrm{d}x = 0$ to hold for all $(D_1, D_2) \\in \\mathbb{R}^2$, the coefficients of $D_1$ and $D_2$ must both be zero:\n$$\n\\int_{K_1} p_h^c \\, \\mathrm{d}x = 0 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\int_{K_2} p_h^c \\, \\mathrm{d}x = 0\n$$\nNow we must compute these integrals using fact (ii) from the problem statement: $\\int_{K} q_h \\, \\mathrm{d}x = \\operatorname{Area}(K) \\times \\frac{1}{3} \\sum_{i=1}^{3} q_h(v_i)$.\nThe area of each triangle is $\\operatorname{Area}(K_1) = \\operatorname{Area}(K_2) = \\frac{1}{2}h^2$.\n\nFor triangle $K_1$, the vertices are $(0,0)$, $(h,0)$, and $(h,h)$. The nodal values of $p_h^c$ at these vertices are $p_h^c(0,0)=1-c$, $p_h^c(h,0)=-1-c$, and $p_h^c(h,h)=1-c$.\nThe integral is:\n$$\n\\int_{K_1} p_h^c \\, \\mathrm{d}x = \\frac{h^2/2}{3} \\left[ (1-c) + (-1-c) + (1-c) \\right] = \\frac{h^2}{6} [1 - 3c]\n$$\nSetting this integral to zero gives the condition $1 - 3c = 0$.\n\nFor triangle $K_2$, the vertices are $(0,0)$, $(h,h)$, and $(0,h)$. The nodal values of $p_h^c$ at these vertices are $p_h^c(0,0)=1-c$, $p_h^c(h,h)=1-c$, and $p_h^c(0,h)=-1-c$.\nThe integral is:\n$$\n\\int_{K_2} p_h^c \\, \\mathrm{d}x = \\frac{h^2/2}{3} \\left[ (1-c) + (1-c) + (-1-c) \\right] = \\frac{h^2}{6} [1 - 3c]\n$$\nThis yields the same condition, $1 - 3c = 0$. Both conditions are satisfied simultaneously if and only if $c$ is chosen to satisfy this single equation.\nSolving for $c$:\n$$\n1 - 3c = 0 \\implies 3c = 1 \\implies c = \\frac{1}{3}\n$$\nThis unique value of $c$ defines a non-constant pressure field $p_h^{1/3}$ which is orthogonal to the divergence of all test functions in $V_h$.\n\nThis construction demonstrates a fundamental instability of the equal-order linear ($P_1/P_1$) finite element pair for the incompressible Stokes problem. The existence of a non-zero, non-constant pressure function $p_h$ such that $b(v_h, p_h) = 0$ for all $v_h \\in V_h$ signifies a failure of the discrete Ladyzhenskaya-Babuška-Brezzi (LBB) condition, also known as the inf-sup condition. This condition is necessary for the stability and well-posedness of the mixed finite element formulation. The pressure mode $p_h^{1/3}$ we constructed is a \"spurious\" or \"parasitic\" mode. The nodal value pattern, which on a larger grid would alternate between positive and negative values at vertices, is characteristic of a \"checkerboard\" instability. These modes are part of the discrete pressure solution space but are not controlled by the velocity field, leading to severe, non-physical oscillations in the computed pressure.\n\nThe Pressure-Stabilizing Petrov-Galerkin (PSPG) method is designed to suppress such spurious modes. It modifies the discrete continuity equation by adding a term that penalizes the residual of the momentum equation within each element. The modified weak form of the continuity equation is, for the case of zero body force:\n$$\nb(u_h, q_h) - \\sum_{K} \\tau_K \\int_K (-\\nu \\Delta_h u_h + \\nabla p_h) \\cdot \\nabla q_h \\, \\mathrm{d}x= 0 \\quad \\forall q_h \\in Q_h\n$$\nwhere $\\tau_K$ is a positive, element-wise stabilization parameter. If a spurious solution pair $(u_h=0, p_h=p_h^{1/3})$ were to exist, it would have to satisfy this equation. Substituting this pair into the stabilized equation gives:\n$$\n0 - \\sum_{K} \\tau_K \\int_K (\\nabla p_h^{1/3}) \\cdot \\nabla q_h \\, \\mathrm{d}x = 0 \\quad \\forall q_h \\in Q_h\n$$\nChoosing the test function $q_h = p_h^{1/3}$, this becomes:\n$$\n\\sum_{K} \\tau_K \\int_K |\\nabla p_h^{1/3}|^2 \\, \\mathrm{d}x = 0\n$$\nSince $\\tau_K > 0$, this forces $\\int_K |\\nabla p_h^{1/3}|^2 \\, \\mathrm{d}x = 0$ for each element $K$, which implies that $\\nabla p_h^{1/3}$ must be zero on each element. However, the constructed pressure mode $p_h^{1/3}$ is not constant on either $K_1$ or $K_2$; its gradient is non-zero. The stabilization term is therefore non-zero for this mode, meaning the spurious pressure mode is no longer a solution to the stabilized system. The PSPG term effectively adds control over the pressure gradient, eliminating the checkerboard instability and restoring stability to the formulation.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{1}{3}}$$", "id": "2590840"}, {"introduction": "Having established the need for stabilization, we now examine the structure of the Pressure-Stabilizing Petrov-Galerkin (PSPG) method.

By comparing the exponents, we find:\n$a = -1$, $b = 3$, $c = 1$.\n\nFinally, we perform the requested verification. The problem suggests that $\\tau_K$ can be constructed from element size $h_K$, kinematic viscosity $\\nu$, density $\\rho$, and characteristic speed $U$. The standard stabilization parameter, often denoted $\\tau_M$, has units of time. In the formulation provided, $\\tau_K$ relates to $\\tau_M$ via $\\tau_K = \\tau_M / \\rho$. Let us verify this.\n-   For the diffusion-dominated (Stokes) regime, the time-like parameter scales as $\\tau_M \\propto h_K^2 / \\nu$. The corresponding $\\tau_K$ would scale as $\\tau_K \\propto h_K^2 / (\\rho \\nu)$. Let us check its dimension:\n    $$\n    \\left[\\frac{h_K^2}{\\rho\\,\\nu}\\right] = \\frac{[\\mathrm{L}]^2}{ (\\mathrm{M}\\,\\mathrm{L}^{-3}) (\\mathrm{L}^2\\,\\mathrm{T}^{-1}) } = \\frac{\\mathrm{L}^2}{\\mathrm{M}\\,\\mathrm{L}^{-1}\\,\\mathrm{T}^{-1}} = \\mathrm{M}^{-1}\\,\\mathrm{L}^{3}\\,\\mathrm{T}^{1}.\n    $$\n    This is consistent with our derived dimension for $\\tau_K$.\n-   For the advection-dominated Navier-Stokes regime, the time-like parameter scales as $\\tau_M \\propto h_K / U$. The corresponding $\\tau_K$ would scale as $\\tau_K \\propto h_K / (\\rho U)$. Let us check its dimension:\n    $$\n    \\left[\\frac{h_K}{\\rho\\,U}\\right] = \\frac{[\\mathrm{L}]}{ (\\mathrm{M}\\,\\mathrm{L}^{-3}) (\\mathrm{L}\\,\\mathrm{T}^{-1}) } = \\frac{\\mathrm{L}}{\\mathrm{M}\\,\\mathrm{L}^{-2}\\,\\mathrm{T}^{-1}} = \\mathrm{M}^{-1}\\,\\mathrm{L}^{3}\\,\\mathrm{T}^{1}.\n    $$\nThis is also consistent with our derived dimension. The analysis is therefore self-consistent and verified against known physical scalings, provided the non-standard definition of $\\tau_K$ is understood as given.
