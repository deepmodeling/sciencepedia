A complete solution will be provided.\n\n**Solution**\n\nThe analysis proceeds in two parts as requested by the problem statement.\n\n**1. Determination of the Trace of $u$ on $\\partial \\Omega$**\n\nThe trace of a function $u \\in H^{1}(\\Omega)$ on the boundary $\\partial \\Omega$ is, for sufficiently regular functions, the limit of the function as the argument approaches the boundary from within the domain. The function $u(x) = \\ln|x|$ is of class $C^{\\infty}(\\mathbb{R}^{3} \\setminus \\{0\\})$. The domain of interest is $\\Omega = B_{1}(0)$, the unit ball. The origin $x=0$, where $u$ is singular, is in the interior of $\\Omega$. However, the boundary $\\partial \\Omega$ is the sphere $\\{x \\in \\mathbb{R}^{3} : |x| = 1\\}$, which is separated from the singularity. On any neighborhood of $\\partial \\Omega$ within $\\Omega$, the function $u$ is continuous.\n\nLet $y$ be an arbitrary point on the boundary, $y \\in \\partial \\Omega$. By definition, $|y| = 1$. The trace of $u$ at point $y$ is found by evaluating the limit:\n$$ \\text{Tr}(u)(y) = \\lim_{\\substack{x \\to y \\\\ x \\in \\Omega}} u(x) $$\nSince $u(x) = \\ln|x|$ is continuous for all $x \\neq 0$, and $|y|=1 \\neq 0$, we can evaluate the limit by direct substitution:\n$$ \\lim_{\\substack{x \\to y \\\\ x \\in \\Omega}} \\ln|x| = \\ln|y| $$\nAs $|y| = 1$, the value is:\n$$ \\ln(1) = 0 $$\nThis holds for any point $y \\in \\partial \\Omega$. Therefore, the trace of $u$ on $\\partial \\Omega$ is the constant function with value $0$.\n\n**2. Verification of Membership in $H^{1}(\\Omega)$ and Application of Poincaré Inequality**\n\nA function $u$ belongs to the Sobolev space $H^{1}(\\Omega)$ if and only if both $u$ and its weak first-order partial derivatives are square-integrable over $\\Omega$. That is, $u \\in L^{2}(\\Omega)$ and $\\nabla u \\in [L^{2}(\\Omega)]^{3}$.\n\nWe will use spherical coordinates $(r, \\theta, \\phi)$ in $\\mathbb{R}^{3}$, where $r = |x|$. The volume element is $dV = r^{2} \\sin(\\theta) \\,dr \\,d\\theta \\,d\\phi$. The domain $\\Omega = B_{1}(0)$ is described by $r \\in [0, 1]$, $\\theta \\in [0, \\pi]$, and $\\phi \\in [0, 2\\pi]$. The function is $u(x) = \\ln(r)$.\n\n**a) Verification that $u \\in L^{2}(\\Omega)$:**\nWe must check if the integral of $|u|^{2}$ over $\\Omega$ is finite.\n$$ \\|u\\|_{L^{2}(\\Omega)}^{2} = \\int_{\\Omega} |u(x)|^{2} \\,dV = \\int_{\\Omega} (\\ln|x|)^{2} \\,dV $$\nIn spherical coordinates, this becomes:\n$$ \\int_{0}^{2\\pi} \\int_{0}^{\\pi} \\int_{0}^{1} (\\ln r)^{2} \\,r^{2} \\sin(\\theta) \\,dr \\,d\\theta \\,d\\phi $$\nThe integral is separable. The angular part is:\n$$ \\int_{0}^{2\\pi} d\\phi \\int_{0}^{\\pi} \\sin(\\theta) \\,d\\theta = (2\\pi) \\cdot [-\\cos(\\theta)]_{0}^{\\pi} = (2\\pi) \\cdot (1 - (-1)) = 4\\pi $$\nThe radial integral is an improper integral due to the singularity of $\\ln(r)$ at $r=0$:\n$$ I_{1} = \\int_{0}^{1} r^{2} (\\ln r)^{2} \\,dr $$\nWe compute this using integration by parts. Let $f(r) = (\\ln r)^{2}$ and $g'(r) = r^{2}$. Then $f'(r) = 2(\\ln r)/r$ and $g(r) = r^{3}/3$.\n$$ \\int r^{2}(\\ln r)^{2} \\,dr = \\frac{r^{3}}{3}(\\ln r)^{2} - \\int \\frac{r^{3}}{3} \\frac{2 \\ln r}{r} \\,dr = \\frac{r^{3}}{3}(\\ln r)^{2} - \\frac{2}{3} \\int r^{2} \\ln r \\,dr $$\nFor the remaining integral, let $f(r) = \\ln r$ and $g'(r)=r^{2}$. Then $f'(r)=1/r$ and $g(r)=r^{3}/3$.\n$$ \\int r^{2} \\ln r \\,dr = \\frac{r^{3}}{3}\\ln r - \\int \\frac{r^{3}}{3} \\frac{1}{r} \\,dr = \\frac{r^{3}}{3}\\ln r - \\frac{1}{3} \\int r^{2} \\,dr = \\frac{r^{3}}{3}\\ln r - \\frac{r^{3}}{9} $$\nSubstituting back, the indefinite integral is:\n$$ \\frac{r^{3}}{3}(\\ln r)^{2} - \\frac{2}{3}\\left(\\frac{r^{3}}{3}\\ln r - \\frac{r^{3}}{9}\\right) + C = \\frac{r^{3}}{3}(\\ln r)^{2} - \\frac{2r^{3}}{9}\\ln r + \\frac{2r^{3}}{27} + C $$\nNow we evaluate the definite integral from $\\epsilon \\to 0$ to $1$:\n$$ I_{1} = \\left[ \\frac{r^{3}}{3}(\\ln r)^{2} - \\frac{2r^{3}}{9}\\ln r + \\frac{2r^{3}}{27} \\right]_{0}^{1} $$\nAt the upper limit $r=1$: $\\frac{1}{3}(0)^{2} - \\frac{2}{9}(0) + \\frac{2}{27} = \\frac{2}{27}$.\nAt the lower limit $r \\to 0^{+}$, we evaluate $\\lim_{r \\to 0^{+}} (C_{1} r^{3}(\\ln r)^{2} - C_{2} r^{3} \\ln r + C_{3} r^{3})$. Standard limits show that for any $p>0$ and $q>0$, $\\lim_{r \\to 0^{+}} r^{p} |\\ln r|^{q} = 0$. Thus, each term approaches $0$.\nSo, $I_{1} = \\frac{2}{27} - 0 = \\frac{2}{27}$.\nThe full integral is finite:\n$$ \\|u\\|_{L^{2}(\\Omega)}^{2} = 4\\pi \\cdot I_{1} = 4\\pi \\cdot \\frac{2}{27} = \\frac{8\\pi}{27} $$\nSince $\\|u\\|_{L^{2}(\\Omega)}^{2}$ is finite, we conclude $u \\in L^{2}(\\Omega)$.\n\n**b) Verification that $\\nabla u \\in [L^{2}(\\Omega)]^{3}$:**\nFor $x \\neq 0$, the classical gradient of $u(x) = \\ln|x| = \\frac{1}{2}\\ln(x_{1}^{2}+x_{2}^{2}+x_{3}^{2})$ is:\n$$ \\nabla u = \\left( \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x_{1}}, \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x_{2}}, \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x_{3}} \\right) = \\left( \\frac{x_{1}}{|x|^{2}}, \\frac{x_{2}}{|x|^{2}}, \\frac{x_{3}}{|x|^{2}} \\right) = \\frac{x}{|x|^{2}} $$\nThe squared magnitude of the gradient is:\n$$ |\\nabla u(x)|^{2} = \\left| \\frac{x}{|x|^{2}} \\right|^{2} = \\frac{|x|^{2}}{(|x|^{2})^{2}} = \\frac{|x|^{2}}{|x|^{4}} = \\frac{1}{|x|^{2}} $$\nFor $u$ to be in $H^{1}(\\Omega)$, the weak gradient must be in $[L^{2}(\\Omega)]^{3}$. For $u \\in C^{\\infty}(\\Omega \\setminus \\{0\\})$, the weak gradient coincides with the classical gradient. We check the $L^{2}$-norm of $|\\nabla u|$:\n$$ \\|\\nabla u\\|_{[L^{2}(\\Omega)]^{3}}^{2} = \\int_{\\Omega} |\\nabla u(x)|^{2} \\,dV = \\int_{\\Omega} \\frac{1}{|x|^{2}} \\,dV $$\nIn spherical coordinates, this is:\n$$ \\int_{0}^{2\\pi} \\int_{0}^{\\pi} \\int_{0}^{1} \\frac{1}{r^{2}} \\,r^{2} \\sin(\\theta) \\,dr \\,d\\theta \\,d\\phi = \\int_{0}^{2\\pi} \\int_{0}^{\\pi} \\int_{0}^{1} \\sin(\\theta) \\,dr \\,d\\theta \\,d\\phi $$\nThe terms $r^{2}$ cancel. The integral of the remaining constant and trigonometric function over the domain is:\n$$ \\left( \\int_{0}^{1} dr \\right) \\left( \\int_{0}^{\\pi} \\sin(\\theta) \\,d\\theta \\right) \\left( \\int_{0}^{2\\pi} d\\phi \\right) = (1) \\cdot (2) \\cdot (2\\pi) = 4\\pi $$\nSince this integral is finite, $\\nabla u \\in [L^{2}(\\Omega)]^{3}$.\nSince both $u \\in L^{2}(\\Omega)$ and $\\nabla u \\in [L^{2}(\\Omega)]^{3}$, we definitively conclude that $u \\in H^{1}(\\Omega)$.\n\n**c) Application of the Poincaré Inequality:**\nThe Poincaré inequality applies to functions in the space $H^{1}_{0}(\\Omega)$, which is defined as the closure of $C_{c}^{\\infty}(\\Omega)$ in the $H^{1}(\\Omega)$ norm. An equivalent characterization is that $H^{1}_{0}(\\Omega)$ is the subset of functions in $H^{1}(\\Omega)$ that have a zero trace on the boundary $\\partial \\Omega$.\n$$ H^{1}_{0}(\\Omega) = \\{ v \\in H^{1}(\\Omega) : \\text{Tr}(v) = 0 \\text{ on } \\partial\\Omega \\} $$\nThe inequality states that for any $v \\in H^{1}_{0}(\\Omega)$, there exists a constant $C_{P} > 0$ depending only on $\\Omega$ such that:\n$$ \\|v\\|_{L^{2}(\\Omega)} \\le C_{P} \\|\\nabla v\\|_{[L^{2}(\\Omega)]^{3}} $$\nIn part 1, we established that the trace of $u(x) = \\ln|x|$ on $\\partial \\Omega$ is zero. In part 2, we showed that $u \\in H^{1}(\\Omega)$. By definition, it follows that $u \\in H^{1}_{0}(\\Omega)$.\nTherefore, the Poincaré inequality must hold for the function $u$. This provides a stability estimate, bounding the $L^{2}$-norm of the function by the $L^{2}$-norm of its gradient (which is the $H^{1}$-seminorm). This is a fundamental result used in proving the well-posedness of boundary-value problems with homogeneous Dirichlet boundary conditions.\n\nThe final answer requested is the explicit value of the trace of $u$ on $\\partial\\Omega$. Based on the analysis in part 1, this value is $0$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0}$$", "id": "2560452"}, {"introduction": "The Poincaré inequality is a cornerstone of FEM theory, providing the coercivity needed for well-posedness proofs.

The problem is mathematically sound, self-contained, and all terms are rigorously defined. Therefore, a solution will be provided.\n\na) Derivation of the scaling law for the Poincaré constant.\n\nLet $\\Omega \\subset \\mathbb{R}^{n}$ be a bounded Lipschitz domain. The sharp Poincaré constant $C_{P}(\\Omega)$ is defined by the relation:\n$$\nC_{P}(\\Omega) = \\sup_{u \\in H_{0}^{1}(\\Omega), u \\neq 0} \\frac{\\|u\\|_{L^{2}(\\Omega)}}{\\|\\nabla u\\|_{L^{2}(\\Omega)}}.\n$$\nWe investigate the effect of a dilation on this constant. Consider the scaled domain $a\\Omega = \\{ax : x \\in \\Omega\\}$ for some scaling factor $a>0$. Let $v$ be an arbitrary function in $H_{0}^{1}(a\\Omega)$. We introduce a change of variables $y = ax$, where $y \\in a\\Omega$ and $x \\in \\Omega$. This transformation defines a corresponding function $u$ on the reference domain $\\Omega$ by the relation $u(x) = v(ax) = v(y)$. The function $u$ is in $H_{0}^{1}(\\Omega)$, and this mapping constitutes an isomorphism between the spaces $H_{0}^{1}(a\\Omega)$ and $H_{0}^{1}(\\Omega)$.\n\nOur goal is to relate the norms of $v$ on $a\\Omega$ to the norms of $u$ on $\\Omega$. We begin with the $L^{2}$-norm of the function. The Jacobian of the transformation $y=ax$ is $a^{n}$, so the change of variables in the integral is $dy = a^{n}dx$.\n$$\n\\|v\\|_{L^{2}(a\\Omega)}^{2} = \\int_{a\\Omega} |v(y)|^{2} \\, dy = \\int_{\\Omega} |v(ax)|^{2} a^{n} \\, dx = a^{n} \\int_{\\Omega} |u(x)|^{2} \\, dx = a^{n} \\|u\\|_{L^{2}(\\Omega)}^{2}.\n$$\nBy taking the square root, we obtain the scaling for the $L^{2}$-norm:\n$$\n\\|v\\|_{L^{2}(a\\Omega)} = a^{n/2} \\|u\\|_{L^{2}(\\Omega)}.\n$$\nNext, we consider the $L^{2}$-norm of the gradient. Let $\\nabla_{y}$ and $\\nabla_{x}$ denote the gradient operators with respect to the variables $y$ and $x$, respectively. Applying the chain rule for weak derivatives yields:\n$$\n\\nabla_{x} u(x) = \\nabla_{x} (v(ax)) = a (\\nabla_{y}v)(ax) = a (\\nabla_{y}v)(y).\n$$\nFrom this, we express the gradient of $v$ in terms of the gradient of $u$: $\\nabla_{y}v(y) = a^{-1}\\nabla_{x}u(x)$. Substituting this into the definition of the norm gives:\n$$\n\\|\\nabla_{y}v\\|_{L^{2}(a\\Omega)}^{2} = \\int_{a\\Omega} |\\nabla_{y}v(y)|^{2} \\, dy = \\int_{\\Omega} |a^{-1}\\nabla_{x}u(x)|^{2} a^{n} \\, dx = a^{-2} a^{n} \\int_{\\Omega} |\\nabla_{x}u(x)|^{2} \\, dx = a^{n-2}\\|\\nabla_{x}u\\|_{L^{2}(\\Omega)}^{2}.\n$$\nTaking the square root gives the scaling relation for the gradient norm:\n$$\n\\|\\nabla_{y}v\\|_{L^{2}(a\\Omega)} = a^{(n-2)/2} \\|\\nabla_{x}u\\|_{L^{2}(\\Omega)}.\n$$\nNow, we can write the expression for the sharp Poincaré constant on the dilated domain, $C_{P}(a\\Omega)$:\n$$\nC_{P}(a\\Omega) = \\sup_{v \\in H_{0}^{1}(a\\Omega), v \\neq 0} \\frac{\\|v\\|_{L^{2}(a\\Omega)}}{\\|\\nabla_{y}v\\|_{L^{2}(a\\Omega)}}.\n$$\nSince the mapping from $v$ to $u$ is a bijection, we can change the supremum from being over $v \\in H_{0}^{1}(a\\Omega)$ to being over $u \\in H_{0}^{1}(\\Omega)$:\n$$\nC_{P}(a\\Omega) = \\sup_{u \\in H_{0}^{1}(\\Omega), u \\neq 0} \\frac{a^{n/2} \\|u\\|_{L^{2}(\\Omega)}}{a^{(n-2)/2} \\|\\nabla_{x}u\\|_{L^{2}(\\Omega)}} = a^{n/2 - (n/2-1)} \\left( \\sup_{u \\in H_{0}^{1}(\\Omega), u \\neq 0} \\frac{\\|u\\|_{L^{2}(\\Omega)}}{\\|\\nabla_{x}u\\|_{L^{2}(\\Omega)}} \\right).\n$$\nThe exponent on $a$ simplifies to $1$. The term in the parentheses is precisely the definition of $C_{P}(\\Omega)$. Thus, we arrive at the linear scaling law:\n$$\nC_{P}(a\\Omega) = a C_{P}(\\Omega).\n$$\nThis result shows that the sharp Poincaré constant scales linearly with the dilation factor $a$, and the constant of proportionality is the Poincaré constant of the unscaled domain $\\Omega$.\n\nb) Computation of the sharp constant for a one-dimensional interval.\n\nWe now specialize to one spatial dimension, $n=1$, where the domain is the interval $I_{L} = (0, L)$ for some $L > 0$. We must compute the exact value of $C_{P}(I_{L})$.\n\nThe sharp Poincaré constant $C_{P}(\\Omega)$ can be characterized in terms of the spectrum of the negative Dirichlet Laplacian operator, $-\\Delta$. The smallest eigenvalue $\\lambda_{1}$ of $-\\Delta$ on $H_{0}^{1}(\\Omega)$ is given by the minimum of the Rayleigh quotient:\n$$\n\\lambda_{1} = \\min_{u \\in H_{0}^{1}(\\Omega), u \\neq 0} \\frac{\\int_{\\Omega} |\\nabla u|^{2} \\, dx}{\\int_{\\Omega} |u|^{2} \\, dx} = \\min_{u \\in H_{0}^{1}(\\Omega), u \\neq 0} \\frac{\\|\\nabla u\\|_{L^{2}(\\Omega)}^{2}}{\\|u\\|_{L^{2}(\\Omega)}^{2}}.\n$$\nFrom this definition, it directly follows that:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\lambda_{1}}} = \\max_{u \\in H_{0}^{1}(\\Omega), u \\neq 0} \\frac{\\|u\\|_{L^{2}(\\Omega)}}{\\|\\nabla u\\|_{L^{2}(\\Omega)}} = C_{P}(\\Omega).\n$$\nTo find $C_{P}(I_{L})$, we must therefore find the smallest eigenvalue $\\lambda_{1}$ of the $1D$ Dirichlet Laplacian on $(0, L)$. In one dimension, the operator $-\\Delta$ is simply $-\\frac{d^{2}}{dx^{2}}$. The eigenvalue problem is the ordinary differential equation:\n$$\n-u''(x) = \\lambda u(x), \\quad x \\in (0, L)\n$$\nsubject to the homogeneous Dirichlet boundary conditions $u(0) = 0$ and $u(L) = 0$.\n\nFor non-trivial solutions to exist, the eigenvalue $\\lambda$ must be strictly positive. We set $\\lambda = k^{2}$ for some wave number $k > 0$. The differential equation becomes $u''(x) + k^{2}u(x) = 0$, which has the general solution:\n$$\nu(x) = C_{1}\\cos(kx) + C_{2}\\sin(kx).\n$$\nWe apply the boundary conditions. The condition $u(0) = 0$ requires:\n$$\nu(0) = C_{1}\\cos(0) + C_{2}\\sin(0) = C_{1} = 0.\n$$\nThis reduces the solution to the form $u(x) = C_{2}\\sin(kx)$. The second boundary condition, $u(L) = 0$, implies:\n$$\nu(L) = C_{2}\\sin(kL) = 0.\n$$\nTo obtain a non-trivial solution (i.e., $u \\not\\equiv 0$), we must have $C_{2} \\neq 0$. This forces the sine term to be zero:\n$$\n\\sin(kL) = 0.\n$$\nThis condition is fulfilled when $kL$ is an integer multiple of $\\pi$. Since $k>0$ and $L>0$, we have:\n$$\nkL = m\\pi, \\quad \\text{for } m \\in \\{1, 2, 3, \\dots\\}.\n$$\nThe admissible wave numbers are $k_{m} = \\frac{m\\pi}{L}$, which give rise to the discrete spectrum of eigenvalues:\n$$\n\\lambda_{m} = k_{m}^{2} = \\left(\\frac{m\\pi}{L}\\right)^{2}.\n$$\nThe smallest eigenvalue, $\\lambda_{1}$, corresponds to the lowest mode, $m=1$:\n$$\n\\lambda_{1} = \\left(\\frac{\\pi}{L}\\right)^{2}.\n$$\nFinally, we calculate the sharp Poincaré constant $C_{P}(I_{L})$ using its relation to $\\lambda_{1}$:\n$$\nC_{P}(I_{L}) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\lambda_{1}}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{(\\pi/L)^{2}}} = \\frac{1}{\\pi/L} = \\frac{L}{\\pi}.\n$$\nThis is the required closed-form analytic expression.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\frac{L}{\\pi}}\n$$", "id": "2560439"}, {"introduction": "The convergence of finite element approximations is a central theme in FEM analysis, hinging on the properties of Sobolev spaces.

This implies that the seminorm $|\\cdot|_{H^{1}(\\Omega)} = \\|\\partial_{x}u\\|_{L^{2}(\\Omega)}$ is a norm on $H^{1}_{0}(\\Omega)$ equivalent to the full $H^{1}(\\Omega)$ norm.\n\nFirst, we compute the norms of $u_n$ and its derivative $\\partial_x u_n$.\nThe derivative of $u_{n}(x)$ is $\\partial_{x}u_{n}(x) = \\frac{d}{dx}\\left(\\frac{1}{n}\\sin(2\\pi n x)\\right) = 2\\pi\\cos(2\\pi n x)$.\n\nThe $L^{2}(\\Omega)$ norm squared of $u_{n}$ is:\n$$\n\\|u_{n}\\|_{L^{2}(\\Omega)}^{2} = \\int_{0}^{1} \\left|\\frac{1}{n}\\sin(2\\pi n x)\\right|^{2} dx = \\frac{1}{n^{2}} \\int_{0}^{1} \\sin^{2}(2\\pi n x) dx\n$$\nUsing the identity $\\sin^{2}(\\theta) = \\frac{1 - \\cos(2\\theta)}{2}$, we get:\n$$\n\\|u_{n}\\|_{L^{2}(\\Omega)}^{2} = \\frac{1}{n^{2}} \\int_{0}^{1} \\frac{1 - \\cos(4\\pi n x)}{2} dx = \\frac{1}{2n^{2}} \\left[x - \\frac{\\sin(4\\pi n x)}{4\\pi n}\\right]_{0}^{1} = \\frac{1}{2n^{2}}(1 - 0) = \\frac{1}{2n^{2}}\n$$\n\nThe $L^{2}(\\Omega)$ norm squared of the derivative $\\partial_{x}u_{n}$ is:\n$$\n\\|\\partial_{x}u_{n}\\|_{L^{2}(\\Omega)}^{2} = \\int_{0}^{1} |2\\pi\\cos(2\\pi n x)|^{2} dx = 4\\pi^{2} \\int_{0}^{1} \\cos^{2}(2\\pi n x) dx\n$$\nUsing the identity $\\cos^{2}(\\theta) = \\frac{1 + \\cos(2\\theta)}{2}$, we get:\n$$\n\\|\\partial_{x}u_{n}\\|_{L^{2}(\\Omega)}^{2} = 4\\pi^{2} \\int_{0}^{1} \\frac{1 + \\cos(4\\pi n x)}{2} dx = 2\\pi^{2} \\left[x + \\frac{\\sin(4\\pi n x)}{4\\pi n}\\right]_{0}^{1} = 2\\pi^{2}(1 - 0) = 2\\pi^{2}\n$$\n\n**1. Boundedness in $H^{1}_{0}(\\Omega)$ and Limits in $L^{2}(\\Omega)$**\n\nTo prove that the sequence $\\{u_{n}\\}$ is bounded in $H^{1}_{0}(\\Omega)$, we examine its $H^{1}(\\Omega)$ norm.\n$$\n\\|u_{n}\\|_{H^{1}(\\Omega)}^{2} = \\|u_{n}\\|_{L^{2}(\\Omega)}^{2} + \\|\\partial_{x}u_{n}\\|_{L^{2}(\\Omega)}^{2} = \\frac{1}{2n^{2}} + 2\\pi^{2}\n$$\nFor any $n \\ge 1$, we have $0 < \\frac{1}{2n^{2}} \\le \\frac{1}{2}$. Thus, $\\|u_{n}\\|_{H^{1}(\\Omega)}^{2} \\le \\frac{1}{2} + 2\\pi^{2}$. Since the norm is bounded by a constant independent of $n$, the sequence $\\{u_{n}\\}$ is bounded in $H^{1}(\\Omega)$, and thus in $H^{1}_{0}(\\Omega)$. Alternatively, using the Poincaré inequality, boundedness of $\\|\\partial_{x}u_{n}\\|_{L^{2}(\\Omega)} = \\sqrt{2}\\pi$ immediately implies boundedness of $\\{u_n\\}$ in $H^{1}_{0}(\\Omega)$.\n\nNext, we identify the limits in $L^{2}(\\Omega)$.\nThe strong limit is found by checking the convergence of the norm. As $n \\to \\infty$,\n$$\n\\|u_{n}\\|_{L^{2}(\\Omega)} = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{2n^{2}}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2} n} \\to 0\n$$\nThis shows that $\\{u_{n}\\}$ converges strongly to the zero function, $u=0$, in $L^{2}(\\Omega)$.\nSince strong convergence implies weak convergence, the weak limit of $\\{u_{n}\\}$ in $L^{2}(\\Omega)$ is also the zero function.\nThe problem mentions using compactness. Since $\\{u_{n}\\}$ is a bounded sequence in $H^{1}_{0}(\\Omega)$ and the embedding $H^{1}_{0}(\\Omega) \\hookrightarrow L^{2}(\\Omega)$ is compact (by the Rellich-Kondrachov theorem), there exists a subsequence $\\{u_{n_{k}}\\}$ that converges strongly in $L^{2}(\\Omega)$ to some limit $u \\in L^{2}(\\Omega)$. We have already shown that the entire sequence converges strongly to $0$ in $L^{2}(\\Omega)$, so any strongly convergent subsequence must also converge to $0$.\n\n**2. No Strong Convergence in $H^{1}(\\Omega)$**\n\nA sequence $\\{v_{n}\\}$ converges strongly in a normed space if and only if it is a Cauchy sequence. For strong convergence in $H^{1}(\\Omega)$, we would need $\\|u_{n} - u\\|_{H^{1}(\\Omega)} \\to 0$ for some $u \\in H^{1}_{0}(\\Omega)$.\nSince strong convergence in $H^{1}(\\Omega)$ implies strong convergence in $L^{2}(\\Omega)$, any hypothetical $H^{1}$-limit $u$ must coincide with the $L^{2}$-limit, which is $u=0$.\nSo, we test for strong convergence to $0$ in $H^{1}(\\Omega)$:\n$$\n\\lim_{n\\to\\infty} \\|u_{n}\\|_{H^{1}(\\Omega)}^{2} = \\lim_{n\\to\\infty} \\left(\\frac{1}{2n^{2}} + 2\\pi^{2}\\right) = 2\\pi^{2}\n$$\nSince this limit is not $0$, the sequence $\\{u_{n}\\}$ does not converge strongly to $0$ in $H^{1}(\\Omega)$.\nTo prove that no subsequence converges strongly, assume for contradiction that there exists a subsequence $\\{u_{n_{k}}\\}$ that converges strongly in $H^{1}(\\Omega)$. As argued above, its limit must be $0$. This would imply $\\lim_{k\\to\\infty}\\|u_{n_{k}}\\|_{H^{1}(\\Omega)} = 0$. But we have calculated that $\\lim_{k\\to\\infty}\\|u_{n_{k}}\\|_{H^{1}(\\Omega)}^{2} = 2\\pi^{2}$, a contradiction. Therefore, no subsequence of $\\{u_{n}\\}$ converges strongly in $H^{1}(\\Omega)$.\nThe failure of strong convergence is entirely due to the behavior of the derivatives $\\{\\partial_{x}u_{n}\\}$, as $\\|\\partial_{x}u_{n}\\|_{L^{2}(\\Omega)}$ does not converge to $0$.\n\n**3. Quantitative Certificate of Failure of Strong Convergence**\n\nWe compute the specified limit inferior, which quantifies the failure of the sequence of derivatives to be a Cauchy sequence. We must evaluate:\n$$\n\\liminf_{\\substack{n,m\\to\\infty\\\\ n\\neq m}}\\left\\|\\partial_{x}u_{n}-\\partial_{x}u_{m}\\right\\|_{L^{2}(\\Omega)}\n$$\nWe compute the squared norm for $n \\neq m$:\n$$\n\\|\\partial_{x}u_{n} - \\partial_{x}u_{m}\\|_{L^{2}(\\Omega)}^{2} = \\int_{0}^{1} |2\\pi\\cos(2\\pi n x) - 2\\pi\\cos(2\\pi m x)|^{2} dx\n$$\n$$\n= 4\\pi^{2} \\int_{0}^{1} (\\cos^{2}(2\\pi n x) - 2\\cos(2\\pi n x)\\cos(2\\pi m x) + \\cos^{2}(2\\pi m x)) dx\n$$\nThe integral separates into three parts:\n$$\n= 4\\pi^{2} \\left( \\int_{0}^{1}\\cos^{2}(2\\pi n x) dx + \\int_{0}^{1}\\cos^{2}(2\\pi m x) dx - 2 \\int_{0}^{1}\\cos(2\\pi n x)\\cos(2\\pi m x) dx \\right)\n$$\nWe have already calculated $\\int_{0}^{1}\\cos^{2}(2\\pi k x) dx = \\frac{1}{2}$ for any integer $k \\ge 1$.\nFor the cross-term, we use the orthogonality of the cosine functions on $L^{2}(0,1)$. For integers $n, m \\ge 1$ with $n \\neq m$:\n$$\n\\int_{0}^{1}\\cos(2\\pi n x)\\cos(2\\pi m x) dx = \\frac{1}{2} \\int_{0}^{1} (\\cos(2\\pi(n-m)x) + \\cos(2\\pi(n+m)x)) dx\n$$\n$$\n= \\frac{1}{2} \\left[ \\frac{\\sin(2\\pi(n-m)x)}{2\\pi(n-m)} + \\frac{\\sin(2\\pi(n+m)x)}{2\\pi(n+m)} \\right]_{0}^{1} = 0\n$$\nSubstituting these results back into the expression for the norm squared:\n$$\n\\|\\partial_{x}u_{n} - \\partial_{x}u_{m}\\|_{L^{2}(\\Omega)}^{2} = 4\\pi^{2} \\left( \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{2} - 2 \\cdot 0 \\right) = 4\\pi^{2}\n$$\nThis result holds for any pair of distinct positive integers $n$ and $m$. Therefore, the norm itself is:\n$$\n\\left\\|\\partial_{x}u_{n}-\\partial_{x}u_{m}\\right\\|_{L^{2}(\\Omega)} = \\sqrt{4\\pi^{2}} = 2\\pi\n$$\nThe expression is a constant for all $n \\neq m$. The limit inferior of a constant sequence is the constant itself. Thus,\n$$\n\\liminf_{\\substack{n,m\\to\\infty\\\\ n\\neq m}}\\left\\|\\partial_{x}u_{n}-\\partial_{x}u_{m}\\right\\|_{L^{2}(\\Omega)} = 2\\pi\n$$\nThis non-zero value demonstrates that the sequence of derivatives $\\{\\partial_{x}u_{n}\\}$ is not a Cauchy sequence in $L^{2}(\\Omega)$, which is the reason for the lack of strong convergence of $\\{u_{n}\\}$ in $H^{1}(\\Omega)$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{2\\pi}\n$$", "id": "2560460"}]}
