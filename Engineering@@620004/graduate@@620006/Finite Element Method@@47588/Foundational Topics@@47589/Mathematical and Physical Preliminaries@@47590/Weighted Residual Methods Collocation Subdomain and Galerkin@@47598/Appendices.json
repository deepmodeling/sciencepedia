It describes a standard boundary value problem for the one-dimensional steady convection-diffusion equation and asks for an analysis of the standard Galerkin finite element method and possible modifications to ensure a discrete maximum principle. The problem is valid.

The space $V_h$ consists of continuous, piecewise linear functions. The approximate solution is $u_h(x) = \\sum_{j=0}^{N} u_j \\phi_j(x)$, where $\\phi_j(x)$ are the standard linear \"hat\" basis functions and $u_j$ are the nodal values. For the Galerkin method, the test functions are chosen from the same space, $v_h(x) = \\phi_i(x)$ for the interior nodes $i=1, \\dots, N-1$.\n\nThe resulting linear system for the interior nodal unknowns $u_1, \\dots, u_{N-1}$ is given by:\n$$ \\sum_{j=0}^{N} u_j \\left( \\int_0^1 \\left( \\varepsilon \\phi_j' \\phi_i' + \\beta \\phi_j' \\phi_i \\right) \\, dx \\right) = 0, \\quad \\text{for } i=1, \\dots, N-1 $$\nThe matrix entries for the linear system $\\mathbf{A}\\mathbf{u}=\\mathbf{b}$ are $A_{ij} = \\int_0^1 (\\varepsilon \\phi_j' \\phi_i' + \\beta \\phi_j' \\phi_i) \\, dx$. Due to the local support of the basis functions, for an interior row $i$, only the entries $A_{i,i-1}$, $A_{i,i}$, and $A_{i,i+1}$ are non-zero.\n\nLet us compute these entries. The derivatives of the basis functions on an element $[x_{k-1}, x_k]$ are $\\phi_{k-1}' = -1/h$ and $\\phi_k' = 1/h$.\nThe diagonal entry is:\n$$ A_{i,i} = \\int_{x_{i-1}}^{x_{i+1}} (\\varepsilon (\\phi_i')^2 + \\beta \\phi_i' \\phi_i) \\, dx = \\int_{x_{i-1}}^{x_i} \\varepsilon (\\frac{1}{h})^2 dx + \\int_{x_i}^{x_{i+1}} \\varepsilon (-\\frac{1}{h})^2 dx + \\int_{x_{i-1}}^{x_i} \\beta (\\frac{1}{h})\\phi_i dx + \\int_{x_i}^{x_{i+1}} \\beta (-\\frac{1}{h})\\phi_i dx $$\n$$ A_{i,i} = \\frac{\\varepsilon}{h} + \\frac{\\varepsilon}{h} + \\frac{\\beta}{2} - \\frac{\\beta}{2} = \\frac{2\\varepsilon}{h} $$\nThe sub-diagonal entry is:\n$$ A_{i,i-1} = \\int_{x_{i-1}}^{x_i} (\\varepsilon \\phi_{i-1}' \\phi_i' + \\beta \\phi_{i-1}' \\phi_i) \\, dx = \\int_{x_{i-1}}^{x_i} \\varepsilon (-\\frac{1}{h})(\\frac{1}{h}) dx + \\int_{x_{i-1}}^{x_i} \\beta (-\\frac{1}{h})\\phi_i dx $$\n$$ A_{i,i-1} = -\\frac{\\varepsilon}{h} - \\frac{\\beta}{2} $$\nThe super-diagonal entry is:\n$$ A_{i,i+1} = \\int_{x_i}^{x_{i+1}} (\\varepsilon \\phi_{i+1}' \\phi_i' + \\beta \\phi_{i+1}' \\phi_i) \\, dx = \\int_{x_i}^{x_{i+1}} \\varepsilon (\\frac{1}{h})(-\\frac{1}{h}) dx + \\int_{x_i}^{x_{i+1}} \\beta (\\frac{1}{h})\\phi_i dx $$\n$$ A_{i,i+1} = -\\frac{\\varepsilon}{h} + \\frac{\\beta}{2} $$\nThe equation for an interior node $x_i$ is thus:\n$$ \\left(-\\frac{\\varepsilon}{h} - \\frac{\\beta}{2}\\right) u_{i-1} + \\left(\\frac{2\\varepsilon}{h}\\right) u_i + \\left(-\\frac{\\varepsilon}{h} + \\frac{\\beta}{2}\\right) u_{i+1} = 0 $$\nUsing the element Péclet number $P_e = \\frac{\\beta h}{2\\varepsilon}$, we can write these coefficients as:\n$$ A_{i,i-1} = -\\frac{\\varepsilon}{h}(1+P_e) \\quad\\quad A_{i,i} = \\frac{2\\varepsilon}{h} \\quad\\quad A_{i,i+1} = -\\frac{\\varepsilon}{h}(1-P_e) $$\nThe Discrete Maximum Principle (DMP) is guaranteed if the coefficient matrix $\\mathbf{A}$ is an M-matrix. For a tridiagonal matrix, this requires positive diagonal entries ($A_{i,i} > 0$), non-positive off-diagonal entries ($A_{i,j} \\le 0$ for $i \\ne j$), and diagonal dominance.\nOur matrix has $A_{i,i} = \\frac{2\\varepsilon}{h} > 0$. The sub-diagonal entry $A_{i,i-1} = -\\frac{\\varepsilon}{h}(1+P_e)$ is always negative since $P_e > 0$. However, the super-diagonal entry $A_{i,i+1} = -\\frac{\\varepsilon}{h}(1-P_e)$ changes sign. It is non-positive only if $1-P_e \\ge 0$, which implies $P_e \\le 1$.\nWhen advection dominates diffusion, $\\beta \\gg \\varepsilon$, which leads to $P_e > 1$. In this case, $A_{i,i+1}$ becomes positive, the matrix is no longer an M-matrix, and the DMP is not satisfied. This results in non-physical oscillations in the numerical solution.\n\nWe will now evaluate the proposed modifications.\n\nA. **Replace the standard test space by a streamline upwind Petrov–Galerkin (SUPG) test space that adds consistent streamline diffusion, tuned so that the effective element Péclet number does not exceed unity.**\nThe SUPG method modifies the test function to $v_h + \\tau \\beta v_h'$, adding an artificial diffusion-like term proportional to the residual. In 1D, this is equivalent to adding diffusion in the streamline (flow) direction. This term can be tuned by the parameter $\\tau$. A proper choice of $\\tau$ can add sufficient artificial diffusion to ensure the resulting system matrix satisfies the M-matrix conditions. The statement describes exactly such a procedure: tuning the method to make the effective Péclet number $P_{e, \\text{eff}} \\le 1$. This restores monotonicity. Therefore, this statement is **Correct**.\n\nB. **Add an artificial diffusion $\\delta \\ge 0$ isotropically so that the effective diffusivity $\\varepsilon_{\\text{eff}}=\\varepsilon+\\delta$ satisfies $\\varepsilon_{\\text{eff}} \\ge \\dfrac{\\beta h}{2}$, thereby restoring the required off-diagonal sign pattern in one dimension.**\nThis is a direct method to enforce monotonicity. By replacing $\\varepsilon$ with $\\varepsilon_{\\text{eff}} = \\varepsilon+\\delta$, the super-diagonal entry becomes $A'_{i,i+1} = -\\frac{\\varepsilon_{\\text{eff}}}{h} + \\frac{\\beta}{2}$. The condition $A'_{i,i+1} \\le 0$ requires $\\varepsilon_{\\text{eff}} \\ge \\frac{\\beta h}{2}$, which is precisely what the statement proposes. This corresponds to enforcing an effective Péclet number $P_{e, \\text{eff}} = \\frac{\\beta h}{2\\varepsilon_{\\text{eff}}} \\le 1$. The method works, albeit at the cost of adding numerical diffusion and reducing accuracy (it is an inconsistent modification unless $\\delta \\to 0$ with $h$). The term \"isotropically\" is more relevant in multiple dimensions but in 1D simply means adding to the second-derivative term. This statement is **Correct**.\n\nC. **Switch to nodal collocation with the same trial space (impose the residual to vanish at the nodes); this produces a monotone scheme for any $P_e$.**\nNodal collocation with piecewise linear elements is ill-defined because the second derivative $u_h''$ is not a function at the nodes. If we interpret this as a central finite difference scheme applied at the nodes, we get $u_h'(x_i) \\approx \\frac{u_{i+1}-u_{i-1}}{2h}$ and $u_h''(x_i) \\approx \\frac{u_{i+1}-2u_i+u_{i-1}}{h^2}$. Substituting these into the PDE yields the exact same algebraic system as the standard Galerkin method. Consequently, it suffers from the same deficiency and produces oscillations when $P_e > 1$. The claim that it is monotone for any $P_e$ is false. This statement is **Incorrect**.\n\nD. **Add a nonlinear, solution-dependent shock-capturing viscosity or flux limiter designed to enforce a local M-matrix structure only where needed, thus recovering monotonicity.**\nThis describes advanced, modern techniques like Flux-Corrected Transport (FCT) or schemes with Total Variation Diminishing (TVD) properties. These methods add artificial diffusion non-linearly and adaptively, applying it only in regions of high gradients (potential shocks or layers) where oscillations would otherwise occur. The objective of such limiters is precisely to enforce a local monotonicity constraint, which leads to a global DMP, without adding excessive diffusion everywhere. This is a very effective strategy. This statement is **Correct**.\n\nE. **Use subdomain weighting with piecewise constant weights equal to $1$ on each element and central numerical fluxes; this is equivalent to an upwind scheme and is monotone for any $P_e$.**\nSubdomain weighting where the integral of the residual is set to zero over control volumes is a finite volume method. If we define control volumes around each node (e.g., $[x_i-h/2, x_i+h/2]$) and use central-difference-type approximations for the fluxes at the control volume faces (based on linear interpolation of nodal values), the resulting algebraic system is identical to that of the standard Galerkin method and the central finite difference method. This scheme is therefore not monotone for $P_e > 1$. Furthermore, a central flux scheme is, by definition, not an upwind scheme. An upwind scheme is indeed monotone for any $P_e$, but the method described does not produce an upwind scheme. The statement contains multiple factual errors. This statement is **Incorrect**.\n\nF. **Uniformly refine the mesh until $\\dfrac{\\beta h}{2\\varepsilon} \\le 1$ everywhere; on such meshes, the standard Galerlin matrix in one dimension satisfies the sign conditions required for a DMP.**\nAs established in our initial analysis, the standard Galerkin matrix becomes an M-matrix and satisfies the DMP if the condition $P_e = \\frac{\\beta h}{2\\varepsilon} \\le 1$ holds. For any fixed problem parameters $\\beta$ and $\\varepsilon$, one can always reduce the mesh size $h$ sufficiently to satisfy this condition. While this may be computationally expensive for problems with very high $\\beta/\\varepsilon$ ratios, it is a mathematically sound and valid method to recover monotonicity.

The governing differential equation is\n$$ -u''(x) = f(x), \\quad x \\in (0,1) $$\nwith boundary conditions $u(0)=u(1)=0$. The collocation method requires the residual $r_{N}(x) := -u_{N}''(x) - f(x)$ to be zero at $N-1$ distinct interior points $\\{x_{j}\\}_{j=1}^{N-1}$. This implies\n$$ -u_{N}''(x_{j}) = f(x_{j}) \\quad \\text{for } j=1, 2, \\dots, N-1. $$\nSince the exact solution $u(x)$ also satisfies $-u''(x_{j}) = f(x_{j})$, we obtain the condition\n$$ u_{N}''(x_{j}) = u''(x_{j}) \\quad \\text{for } j=1, 2, \\dots, N-1. $$\nThe approximate solution $u_{N}(x)$ is a polynomial of degree at most $N$. Consequently, its second derivative, $u_{N}''(x)$, is a polynomial of degree at most $N-2$. A polynomial of degree at most $N-2$ is uniquely determined by its values at $N-1$ distinct points. Therefore, $u_{N}''(x)$ must be the unique polynomial interpolant of the function $u''(x)$ at the set of interior collocation points $\\{x_{j}\\}_{j=1}^{N-1}$. Let us denote this interpolant by $\\mathcal{I}_{N-2}(u'')$.\n\nLet the error function be $e_{N}(x) = u(x) - u_{N}(x)$. This error function satisfies homogeneous boundary conditions, $e_{N}(0)=u(0)-u_{N}(0)=0$ and $e_{N}(1)=u(1)-u_{N}(1)=0$.

The affine mapping $x = \\frac{1}{2}(y+1)$ transforms the interval $[0,1]$ to $[-1,1]$. Let $\\hat{u}(y) = u(\\frac{1}{2}(y+1))$. The problem states that $\\hat{u}(y)$ extends analytically to the open Bernstein ellipse $E_{\\rho}$ with parameter $\\rho>1$. If a function is analytic in a region, so are its derivatives. The function being interpolated is $u''(x)$. In the transformed coordinate $y$, this corresponds to $u''(\\frac{1}{2}(y+1))$. By the chain rule, $u''(x) = 4\\hat{u}''(y)$. Thus, the function being interpolated, when viewed on $[-1,1]$, is also analytic on $E_{\\rho}$.\n\nThe error of polynomial interpolation of degree $M$ for a function $g(y)$ analytic on $E_{\\rho}$ and bounded by a constant on its closure can be bounded as\n$$ \\|g - \\mathcal{I}_{M}(g)\\|_{L^{\\infty}(-1,1)} \\le (\\Lambda_{M}+1) \\inf_{p\\in\\Pi_M}\\|g-p\\|_{L^{\\infty}(-1,1)}. $$\nThe error of the best uniform polynomial approximation of degree $M$ for such a function $g$ has the asymptotic behavior $\\mathcal{O}(\\rho^{-M})$.

Equal-order continuous linear interpolation for both displacement and pressure (i.e., $P_1\\text{–}P_1$) with standard Galerkin weighted residual discretization is unconditionally stable as $\\lambda \\to \\infty$ because the incompressibility constraint is only weakly enforced; therefore, no inf–sup constraint on $(V_h,W_h)$ is needed, and locking cannot occur.\n\nC. A viable remedy within mixed elements is to augment the Galerkin weighted residual formulation with a consistent pressure stabilization term (for example, a pressure-jump penalty on interelement boundaries or a pressure-stabilized Petrov–Galerkin term) scaled independently of $\\lambda$ so as to provide uniform stability for equal-order pairs; when designed consistently, such stabilization avoids locking and preserves optimal rates.\n\nD. Replacing the Galerkin weighting in the pressure equation by collocation (choosing $q_h$ as Dirac measures at nodal or quadrature points) makes the incompressibility constraint pointwise and therefore always suppresses spurious pressure modes and removes locking for any pair $(V_h,W_h)$.\n\nE. Selective reduced integration of the volumetric term in a displacement-only formulation is rigorously equivalent to a stable mixed method and thus provides a universally valid remedy for nearly incompressible response without introducing a pressure field, regardless of mesh or element type.\n\nAnswer by selecting the correct option(s).", "solution": "The problem statement describes the mixed displacement-pressure formulation of linear elasticity in the nearly incompressible regime. The formulation is standard and mathematically sound. It correctly identifies the function spaces, the strong form, and the corresponding weak (Galerkin) form. The question asks to evaluate several statements concerning the numerical stability of finite element discretizations of this problem, particularly in the limit of incompressibility where the Lamé parameter $\\lambda \\to \\infty$. The key concepts invoked are the Ladyzhenskaya–Babuška–Brezzi (LBB) inf-sup condition, volumetric locking, and spurious pressure modes. The problem is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. We may proceed with the analysis.\n\nThe discretized weak form is a saddle-point problem. Its stability hinges on two conditions:\n$1$. Coercivity of the bilinear form $a(u_h, v_h) = \\int_{\\Omega} 2\\mu\\,\\varepsilon(u_h):\\varepsilon(v_h)\\,dx$ on the kernel of the discrete divergence operator. For the given problem, this is guaranteed as long as the domain supports no rigid body motions, which is ensured by the homogeneous Dirichlet conditions $u=0$ on $\\partial\\Omega$.\n$2$. The discrete LBB inf-sup condition must hold for the pair of finite element spaces $(V_h, W_h)$, which dictates that there exists a constant $\\beta > 0$, independent of the mesh size $h$, such that:\n$$ \\inf_{q_h \\in W_h/K_0} \\sup_{v_h \\in V_h} \\frac{-\\int_{\\Omega} q_h (\\nabla \\cdot v_h) \\,dx}{\\|v_h\\|_{[H^1(\\Omega)]^d} \\|q_h\\|_{L^2(\\Omega)/K_0}} \\ge \\beta $$\nHere, $W_h/K_0$ denotes the pressure space modulo the kernel of the continuous divergence operator (constant pressures, if applicable). For the method to be stable in the nearly incompressible limit, this condition must hold uniformly as $\\lambda \\to \\infty$. Failure to satisfy this condition leads to numerical instabilities.\n\nWe now evaluate each statement.\n\n**A. In the Galerkin weighted residual mixed formulation, if $(V_h,W_h)$ does not satisfy a discrete LBB inf–sup condition uniformly in $\\lambda$, then as $\\lambda \\to \\infty$ the discrete constraint $\\nabla \\cdot u_h \\approx 0$ becomes overconstraining relative to $V_h$, leading to volumetric locking and spurious pressure modes. Choosing an LBB-stable pair (for example, Taylor–Hood with continuous quadratic displacement and continuous linear pressure on simplices, i.e., $P_2\\text{–}P_1$) eliminates locking and yields optimal convergence.**\n\nThis statement is **Correct**. The LBB condition is the fundamental requirement for the stability of a mixed finite element method for a constrained problem like incompressible elasticity. As $\\lambda \\to \\infty$, the term $-\\int_{\\Omega} \\tfrac{1}{\\lambda} p\\,q\\,dx$ in the second weak-form equation vanishes, leading to the constraint $\\int_{\\Omega} q_h (\\nabla \\cdot u_h) \\,dx = 0$ for all $q_h \\in W_h$. If the pressure space $W_h$ is too large or not correctly paired with the displacement space $V_h$ (i.e., LBB fails), two pathologies can occur. First, the set of weakly divergence-free functions in $V_h$ can become trivial or too small, which \"locks\" the solution (volumetric locking), yielding an overly stiff response and poor convergence. Second, the discrete divergence operator can have a large kernel, allowing for non-physical, oscillatory pressure solutions (spurious modes) that are not controlled by the displacement. The failure of the LBB condition is the mathematical source of these instabilities. The Taylor–Hood element family, such as the $P_2\\text{–}P_1$ (quadratic velocity, linear pressure) element, is a classic example of an LBB-stable pair that circumvents these issues and provides optimal rates of convergence.\n\n**B. Equal-order continuous linear interpolation for both displacement and pressure (i.e., $P_1\\text{–}P_1$) with standard Galerkin weighted residual discretization is unconditionally stable as $\\lambda \\to \\infty$ because the incompressibility constraint is only weakly enforced; therefore, no inf–sup constraint on $(V_h,W_h)$ is needed, and locking cannot occur.**\n\nThis statement is **Incorrect**. The reasoning presented is fundamentally flawed. The use of equal-order continuous linear functions for displacement and pressure, the $P_1\\text{–}P_1$ element, is a well-known example of an LBB-unstable pair for incompressible problems. The weak enforcement of the constraint is precisely why the LBB condition is necessary for stability; it ensures the compatibility between the trial and test spaces. Far from being unconditionally stable, the $P_1\\text{–}P_1$ element is plagued by spurious checkerboard-like pressure oscillations. The claim that \"no inf-sup constraint...is needed\" is a direct contradiction of the established theory of mixed finite element methods. Furthermore, while most noted for spurious pressures, the element's performance deteriorates significantly in the incompressible limit, a manifestation of locking.\n\n**C. A viable remedy within mixed elements is to augment the Galerkin weighted residual formulation with a consistent pressure stabilization term (for example, a pressure-jump penalty on interelement boundaries or a pressure-stabilized Petrov–Galerkin term) scaled independently of $\\lambda$ so as to provide uniform stability for equal-order pairs; when designed consistently, such stabilization avoids locking and preserves optimal rates.**\n\nThis statement is **Correct**. This accurately describes the principle behind stabilized finite element methods. For element pairs that do not satisfy the LBB condition, such as equal-order interpolations, stability can be restored by adding carefully designed terms to the weak formulation. These terms, such as those in Pressure-Stabilized Petrov-Galerkin (PSPG) or Galerkin/Least-Squares (GLS) methods, typically act on the residuals of the governing equations and are scaled by a stabilization parameter $\\tau$. For the stabilization to be effective in the nearly incompressible limit, $\\tau$ must be chosen appropriately, usually depending on the mesh size $h$ and the shear modulus $\\mu$, but critically, remaining independent of $\\lambda$. This ensures that the method does not degrade as $\\lambda \\to \\infty$. A \"consistent\" stabilization term is one that vanishes when the exact solution is inserted, ensuring that the method does not introduce artificial error and can still achieve optimal convergence rates. This approach is a standard and effective technique for using otherwise unstable but computationally convenient element pairs like $P_1\\text{–}P_1$.\n\n**D. Replacing the Galerkin weighting in the pressure equation by collocation (choosing $q_h$ as Dirac measures at nodal or quadrature points) makes the incompressibility constraint pointwise and therefore always suppresses spurious pressure modes and removes locking for any pair $(V_h,W_h)$.**\n\nThis statement is **Incorrect**. While collocation—enforcing the constraint equation at a discrete set of points—is a valid weighted residual strategy, the claim that it \"*always*\" works for \"*any pair*\" is a gross oversimplification and false. The stability of a collocation method depends critically on the number and location of the collocation points relative to the degrees of freedom of the displacement and pressure fields. This creates its own version of the LBB condition, which is not automatically satisfied. If the number of collocation points is not properly balanced with the dimensionality of the finite element spaces, one can easily encounter either locking (too many constraint points) or an under-determined pressure field. Collocation is not a universal solution that bypasses stability considerations.\n\n**E. Selective reduced integration of the volumetric term in a displacement-only formulation is rigorously equivalent to a stable mixed method and thus provides a universally valid remedy for nearly incompressible response without introducing a pressure field, regardless of mesh or element type.**\n\nThis statement is **Incorrect**. This refers to methods like SRI (Selective Reduced Integration) or B-bar methods. The equivalence theory of Malkus and Hughes shows that for certain element types, applying reduced quadrature to the volumetric term of a penalty-based displacement formulation is identical to a specific mixed method. However, the claim of universal validity is false. The equivalence may be to an *unstable* mixed method. For instance, using $1$-point quadrature for the volumetric part of a $4$-node quadrilateral displacement element ($Q_1$) is equivalent to the $Q_1-P_0$ (bilinear displacement, constant pressure) mixed method, which is known to suffer from locking and instability issues on its own. While for other elements, like the $9$-node quadrilateral ($Q_2$), SRI is equivalent to a stable mixed method ($Q_2\\text{–}P_1^{disc}$), this success is highly element-dependent. Therefore, SRI is not a universally valid remedy \"regardless of ... element type\".\n\nIn conclusion, statements A and C are correct representations of the theory of mixed and stabilized finite element methods for nearly incompressible elasticity.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{AC}$$", "id": "2612186"}]}
