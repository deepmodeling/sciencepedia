It is a well-posed problem in structural mechanics based on established principles of linear elasticity and energy methods. All necessary data are provided, and there are no internal contradictions or scientific fallacies. We will proceed with the solution.\n\nThe problem requires a multistep analysis based on the principle of complementary energy. We will address each part systematically.\n\nFirst, let us define the compliance, $C$, and its relationship to strain energy, $U$, for a linear elastic system. For a system subjected to a set of conservative external forces $\\mathbf{F}$ that result in corresponding displacements $\\mathbf{d}$, the external work done, $W_e$, during a quasi-static loading process is given by $W_e = \\frac{1}{2}\\mathbf{F} \\cdot \\mathbf{d}$. This is due to the linear relationship between force and displacement. By the principle of conservation of energy for an adiabatic elastic process, this external work is stored as internal strain energy, $U$. Therefore, $U = \\frac{1}{2}\\mathbf{F} \\cdot \\mathbf{d}$. The compliance, $C$, is defined as the work that would be done if the final loads were to act through the final displacements, which is $C = \\mathbf{F} \\cdot \\mathbf{d}$. By direct comparison of these two definitions, we establish the relationship $C = 2U$. For the specific case of a single downward vertical load $P$ at the top node causing a vertical displacement $\\Delta$ at that node, these relations become $U = \\frac{1}{2}P\\Delta$ and $C = P\\Delta$, which again yields $C = 2U$.\n\nSecond, we explain the upper-bound property of complementary energy. The principle of minimum complementary energy states that among all possible internal force or stress fields that are statically admissible (i.e., satisfy the equations of equilibrium with the applied external loads), the true or exact field is the one that minimizes the total complementary energy, $U^*$. Let $\\{N_i^{ex}\\}$ be the set of axial forces in the truss members for the exact solution, and $\\{N_i^{sa}\\}$ be the set of forces for any other statically admissible field. The principle states that $U^*(\\{N_i^{sa}\\}) \\ge U^*(\\{N_i^{ex}\\})$. For a linear elastic material, the complementary energy of the exact state is equal to the strain energy of the exact state, i.e., $U^*(\\{N_i^{ex}\\}) = U(\\{u_i^{ex}\\})$, where $u_i^{ex}$ are the exact member elongations. As we have just established, the compliance $C$ is twice the exact strain energy, $C = 2U(\\{u_i^{ex}\\})$. Combining these facts, we have $U^*(\\{N_i^{sa}\\}) \\ge U_{exact} = \\frac{1}{2}C$. Therefore, for any statically admissible field, twice the complementary energy provides an upper bound on the exact compliance: $2U^*(\\{N_i^{sa}\\}) \\ge C$.\n\nThird, we will apply this principle to the given truss structure using the specified statically admissible field. Let the top node be at coordinates $(0, 3)$, the left support at $(-2, 0)$, the right support at $(2, 0)$, and the middle support at $(0, 0)$. All coordinates are in meters.\nLet bar $1$ be the left inclined bar, bar $2$ be the right inclined bar, and bar $3$ be the vertical bar.\nThe lengths of the bars are:\n$L_{\\text{vert}} = L_3 = 3\\,\\mathrm{m}$.\n$L_{\\text{incl}} = L_1 = L_2 = \\sqrt{(2-0)^2 + (3-0)^2} = \\sqrt{4+9} = \\sqrt{13}\\,\\mathrm{m}$.\nLet $\\theta$ be the angle between the inclined bars and the vertical axis. The cosine of this angle is $\\cos\\theta = \\frac{3}{\\sqrt{13}}$.\n\nThe problem specifies a statically admissible axial force field where the vertical bar carries zero axial force, $N_3^{sa} = 0$, and the two inclined bars carry equal axial forces, $N_1^{sa} = N_2^{sa} = N_{\\text{incl}}^{sa}$. To be statically admissible, this field must satisfy equilibrium at the top node under the external load $P = 100\\,\\mathrm{kN}$ acting downwards.\nConsidering vertical equilibrium at the top joint, and defining tensile forces as positive, the sum of vertical forces is:\n$$ \\sum F_y = -N_1^{sa} \\cos\\theta - N_2^{sa} \\cos\\theta - N_3^{sa} - P = 0 $$\nSubstituting the specified conditions $N_3^{sa}=0$ and $N_1^{sa} = N_2^{sa} = N_{\\text{incl}}^{sa}$:\n$$ -2 N_{\\text{incl}}^{sa} \\cos\\theta - P = 0 $$\nSolving for $N_{\\text{incl}}^{sa}$:\n$$ N_{\\text{incl}}^{sa} = -\\frac{P}{2\\cos\\theta} = -\\frac{P}{2(3/\\sqrt{13})} = -\\frac{P\\sqrt{13}}{6} $$\nThe negative sign indicates that the inclined members are in compression, as expected. The chosen force field is indeed statically admissible. Our field is $\\{N_1^{sa}, N_2^{sa}, N_3^{sa}\\} = \\{-\\frac{P\\sqrt{13}}{6}, -\\frac{P\\sqrt{13}}{6}, 0\\}$.\n\nFourth, we compute the complementary energy for this field. For a truss member with axial force $N$, length $L$, cross-sectional area $A$, and Young's modulus $E$, the complementary energy is $U^*_i = \\frac{N_i^2 L_i}{2 A_i E}$.\nThe total complementary energy of the system for our statically admissible field is:\n$$ U^* = \\sum_{i=1}^{3} \\frac{(N_i^{sa})^2 L_i}{2 A_i E} = \\frac{(N_1^{sa})^2 L_1}{2 A_1 E} + \\frac{(N_2^{sa})^2 L_2}{2 A_2 E} + \\frac{(N_3^{sa})^2 L_3}{2 A_3 E} $$\nUsing the known values $L_1=L_2=L_{\\text{incl}}$, $A_1=A_2=A_{\\text{incl}}$, and $N_3^{sa}=0$:\n$$ U^* = 2 \\times \\frac{(N_{\\text{incl}}^{sa})^2 L_{\\text{incl}}}{2 A_{\\text{incl}} E} = \\frac{(-\\frac{P\\sqrt{13}}{6})^2 \\sqrt{13}}{A_{\\text{incl}} E} = \\frac{\\frac{P^2 \\cdot 13}{36} \\sqrt{13}}{A_{\\text{incl}} E} = \\frac{13\\sqrt{13} P^2}{36 A_{\\text{incl}} E} $$\nThe upper bound on the compliance, $C_{upper}$, is $2U^*$:\n$$ C_{upper} = 2 U^* = 2 \\times \\frac{13\\sqrt{13} P^2}{36 A_{\\text{incl}} E} = \\frac{13\\sqrt{13} P^2}{18 A_{\\text{incl}} E} $$\nNow we substitute the given numerical values:\n$P = 100\\,\\mathrm{kN} = 100 \\times 10^3\\,\\mathrm{N} = 1 \\times 10^5\\,\\mathrm{N}$.\n$A_{\\text{incl}} = 800\\,\\mathrm{mm}^2 = 800 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{m}^2 = 8 \\times 10^{-4}\\,\\mathrm{m}^2$.\n$E = 200\\,\\mathrm{GPa} = 200 \\times 10^9\\,\\mathrm{N/m}^2 = 2 \\times 10^{11}\\,\\mathrm{N/m}^2$.\n\n$$ C_{upper} = \\frac{13\\sqrt{13} (1 \\times 10^5\\,\\mathrm{N})^2}{18 (8 \\times 10^{-4}\\,\\mathrm{m}^2) (2 \\times 10^{11}\\,\\mathrm{N/m}^2)} $$\n$$ C_{upper} = \\frac{13\\sqrt{13} \\times 10^{10}}{18 \\times 16 \\times 10^7} \\ \\mathrm{N \\cdot m} $$\n$$ C_{upper} = \\frac{13\\sqrt{13} \\times 10^{10}}{288 \\times 10^7} \\ \\mathrm{J} = \\frac{13\\sqrt{13} \\times 10^3}{288} \\ \\mathrm{J} $$\n$$ C_{upper} = \\frac{13 \\times 3.60555 \\times 1000}{288} \\ \\mathrm{J} \\approx \\frac{46872.166}{288} \\ \\mathrm{J} \\approx 162.75057\\,\\mathrm{J} $$\nRounding the result to four significant figures, we get $162.8\\,\\mathrm{J}$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{162.8}$$", "id": "2577334"}, {"introduction": "This practice bridges the gap between variational theory and its computational implementation in the finite element method.

In matrix form, $u_h(x) = \\mathbf{N}(x) \\mathbf{d}$ with $\\mathbf{N} = \\begin{pmatrix} N_1(x) & N_2(x) \\end{pmatrix}$ and $\\mathbf{d} = \\begin{pmatrix} u_1 \\\\ u_2 \\end{pmatrix}$.\nThe strain is approximated as $\\varepsilon_h(x) = \\frac{du_h}{dx} = \\mathbf{B} \\mathbf{d}$, where $\\mathbf{B} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{dN_1}{dx} & \\frac{dN_2}{dx} \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} -\\frac{1}{L} & \\frac{1}{L} \\end{pmatrix}$.\nSubstituting this approximation into the functional $\\Pi[u]$ yields the discrete potential energy $\\Pi(\\mathbf{d})$:\n$$\\Pi(\\mathbf{d}) = \\frac{1}{2} \\int_0^L E A (\\mathbf{B}\\mathbf{d})^T(\\mathbf{B}\\mathbf{d}) dx - \\int_0^L b (\\mathbf{N}\\mathbf{d}) dx - T u_2 + \\frac{1}{2}\\alpha u_1^2$$\nThis can be rewritten in standard matrix form:\n$$\\Pi(\\mathbf{d}) = \\frac{1}{2}\\mathbf{d}^T \\left( E A \\int_0^L \\mathbf{B}^T \\mathbf{B} dx \\right) \\mathbf{d} - \\left( \\int_0^L b \\mathbf{N}^T dx \\right)^T \\mathbf{d} - \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ T \\end{pmatrix}^T \\mathbf{d} + \\frac{1}{2} \\mathbf{d}^T \\begin{pmatrix} \\alpha & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\mathbf{d}$$\nThe standard element stiffness matrix $\\mathbf{K}$ is:\n$$\\mathbf{K} = EA \\int_0^L \\begin{pmatrix} -1/L \\\\ 1/L \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} -1/L & 1/L \\end{pmatrix} dx = \\frac{EA}{L^2} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & -1 \\\\ -1 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} \\int_0^L dx = \\frac{EA}{L} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & -1 \\\\ -1 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$$\nThe penalty matrix is $\\mathbf{K}_{penalty} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\alpha & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$.\nThe modified stiffness matrix $K^{(\\alpha)}$ is the sum $\\mathbf{K} + \\mathbf{K}_{penalty}$:\n$$K^{(\\alpha)} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{EA}{L} + \\alpha & -\\frac{EA}{L} \\\\ -\\frac{EA}{L} & \\frac{EA}{L} \\end{pmatrix}$$\nThe element load vector contribution from the body force $b$ is:\n$$\\mathbf{f}_b = \\int_0^L b \\mathbf{N}^T dx = b \\begin{pmatrix} \\int_0^L (1-x/L) dx \\\\ \\int_0^L (x/L) dx \\end{pmatrix} = b \\begin{pmatrix} [x - x^2/(2L)]_0^L \\\\ [x^2/(2L)]_0^L \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{bL}{2} \\\\ \\frac{bL}{2} \\end{pmatrix}$$\nThe load vector from the traction $T$ is $\\mathbf{f}_T = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ T \\end{pmatrix}$.\nThe modified load vector $f^{(\\alpha)}$ is the sum $\\mathbf{f}_b + \\mathbf{f}_T$:\n$$f^{(\\alpha)} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{bL}{2} \\\\ \\frac{bL}{2} + T \\end{pmatrix}$$\nThe MPE requires stationarity, $\\frac{\\partial\\Pi}{\\partial\\mathbf{d}} = 0$, which yields the linear system $K^{(\\alpha)}\\mathbf{d} = f^{(\\alpha)}$.\n\nStep 3: Solve the system and evaluate the limit.\nThe system of linear equations is:\n$$\n\\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{EA}{L} + \\alpha & -\\frac{EA}{L} \\\\ -\\frac{EA}{L} & \\frac{EA}{L} \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} u_1 \\\\ u_2 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{bL}{2} \\\\ \\frac{bL}{2} + T \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThis represents two scalar equations:\n(1) $\\left(\\frac{EA}{L} + \\alpha\\right) u_1 - \\frac{EA}{L} u_2 = \\frac{bL}{2}$\n(2) $-\\frac{EA}{L} u_1 + \\frac{EA}{L} u_2 = \\frac{bL}{2} + T$\nFrom equation (2), we solve for $u_1$ in terms of $u_2$:\n$$\\frac{EA}{L} u_1 = \\frac{EA}{L} u_2 - \\left(\\frac{bL}{2} + T\\right) \\implies u_1 = u_2 - \\frac{L}{EA}\\left(\\frac{bL}{2} + T\\right)$$\nSubstituting this into equation (1):\n$$\\left(\\frac{EA}{L} + \\alpha\\right) \\left[ u_2 - \\frac{L}{EA}\\left(\\frac{bL}{2} + T\\right) \\right] - \\frac{EA}{L} u_2 = \\frac{bL}{2}$$\nExpanding and rearranging terms to solve for $u_2$:\n$$\\left(\\frac{EA}{L} + \\alpha - \\frac{EA}{L}\\right) u_2 = \\frac{bL}{2} + \\left(\\frac{EA}{L} + \\alpha\\right) \\frac{L}{EA} \\left(\\frac{bL}{2} + T\\right)$$\n$$\\alpha u_2 = \\frac{bL}{2} + \\left(1 + \\frac{\\alpha L}{EA}\\right) \\left(\\frac{bL}{2} + T\\right) = \\frac{bL}{2} + \\left(\\frac{bL}{2} + T\\right) + \\frac{\\alpha L}{EA}\\left(\\frac{bL}{2} + T\\right)$$\n$$\\alpha u_2 = bL + T + \\frac{\\alpha L}{EA}\\left(\\frac{bL}{2} + T\\right)$$\nThus, the solution for $u_2$ as a function of $\\alpha$ is:\n$$u_2(\\alpha) = \\frac{bL + T}{\\alpha} + \\frac{L}{EA}\\left(\\frac{bL}{2} + T\\right)$$\nWe now evaluate the limit $u_2^{\\star} = \\lim_{\\alpha \\to \\infty} u_2(\\alpha)$:\n$$u_2^{\\star} = \\lim_{\\alpha \\to \\infty} \\left[\\frac{bL + T}{\\alpha} + \\frac{L}{EA}\\left(\\frac{bL}{2} + T\\right)\\right] = 0 + \\frac{L}{EA}\\left(\\frac{bL}{2} + T\\right)$$\nSo, $u_2^{\\star} = \\frac{L}{EA}\\left(\\frac{bL}{2} + T\\right)$. This result corresponds to the exact solution for the problem where the boundary condition $u(0)=0$ is strictly enforced.\n\nStep 4: Calculate the nondimensional compliance factor $C$.\nThe factor $C$ is defined as:\n$$C \\equiv \\frac{\\left(\\frac{E A}{L}\\right)\\,u_2^{\\star}}{\\frac{b L}{2}+T}$$\nSubstituting the expression for $u_2^{\\star}$:\n$$C = \\frac{\\left(\\frac{E A}{L}\\right)\\left[\\frac{L}{EA}\\left(\\frac{bL}{2} + T\\right)\\right]}{\\frac{b L}{2}+T}$$\nThe terms $\\frac{EA}{L}$ and $\\frac{L}{EA}$ in the numerator cancel to $1$:\n$$C = \\frac{1 \\cdot \\left(\\frac{bL}{2} + T\\right)}{\\frac{bL}{2} + T}$$\nGiven the assumption that $\\frac{bL}{2}+T \\neq 0$, we can cancel the numerator and denominator, which yields:\n$$C = 1$$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{1}$$", "id": "2577382"}]}
