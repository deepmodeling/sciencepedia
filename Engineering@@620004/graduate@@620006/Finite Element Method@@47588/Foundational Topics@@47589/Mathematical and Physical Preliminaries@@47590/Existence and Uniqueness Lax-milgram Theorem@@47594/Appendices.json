We are given a Hilbert space $V = H^{1}(0,1)$, a bilinear form $a(\\cdot,\\cdot)$, and a linear functional $f$, and are tasked with proving several properties that culminate in showing the unsolvability of the variational equation $a(u,v) = f(v)$. We will proceed by addressing each of the four specified tasks in a systematic and rigorous manner.\n\nFirst, we address Task 1: to prove the continuity of the bilinear form $a(u,v) = \\int_{0}^{1} u'(x) v'(x) \\, dx$ and the linear functional $f(v) = \\int_{0}^{1} v(x) \\, dx$ on the Hilbert space $V = H^{1}(0,1)$. The norm on $V$ is given by $\\|v\\|_{V} = \\left( \\int_{0}^{1} |v(x)|^{2} \\, dx + \\int_{0}^{1} |v'(x)|^{2} \\, dx \\right)^{1/2}$.\n\nTo establish the continuity of $a(\\cdot,\\cdot)$, we must find a constant $C \\geq 0$ such that $|a(u,v)| \\leq C \\|u\\|_{V} \\|v\\|_{V}$ for all $u, v \\in V$. We start with the definition of $a(u,v)$ and apply the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality for integrals, which states that for square-integrable functions $g$ and $h$, $\\left| \\int_{0}^{1} g(x)h(x) \\, dx \\right| \\leq \\left( \\int_{0}^{1} |g(x)|^{2} \\, dx \\right)^{1/2} \\left( \\int_{0}^{1} |h(x)|^{2} \\, dx \\right)^{1/2}$.\nLetting $g(x) = u'(x)$ and $h(x) = v'(x)$, we have:\n$$|a(u,v)| = \\left| \\int_{0}^{1} u'(x)v'(x) \\, dx \\right| \\leq \\left( \\int_{0}^{1} |u'(x)|^{2} \\, dx \\right)^{1/2} \\left( \\int_{0}^{1} |v'(x)|^{2} \\, dx \\right)^{1/2}$$\nWe denote the $L^{2}$-norm of the derivative as $\\|w'\\|_{L^{2}} = \\left( \\int_{0}^{1} |w'(x)|^{2} \\, dx \\right)^{1/2}$. The inequality becomes $|a(u,v)| \\leq \\|u'\\|_{L^{2}} \\|v'\\|_{L^{2}}$. Now, we relate this to the $H^{1}$-norm, $\\|w\\|_{V}$. By definition of the norm, for any $w \\in V$:\n$$\\|w'\\|_{L^{2}}^{2} = \\int_{0}^{1} |w'(x)|^{2} \\, dx \\leq \\int_{0}^{1} |w(x)|^{2} \\, dx + \\int_{0}^{1} |w'(x)|^{2} \\, dx = \\|w\\|_{V}^{2}$$\nTaking the square root, we get $\\|w'\\|_{L^{2}} \\leq \\|w\\|_{V}$. Applying this to our inequality for $a(u,v)$:\n$$|a(u,v)| \\leq \\|u'\\|_{L^{2}} \\|v'\\|_{L^{2}} \\leq \\|u\\|_{V} \\|v\\|_{V}$$\nThis demonstrates that $a(\\cdot, \\cdot)$ is continuous on $V \\times V$ with a continuity constant $C=1$.\n\nNext, for the continuity of the linear functional $f(v) = \\int_{0}^{1} v(x) \\, dx$, we must find a constant $M \\geq 0$ such that $|f(v)| \\leq M \\|v\\|_{V}$ for all $v \\in V$. We again apply the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality for integrals, considering $v(x) = 1 \\cdot v(x)$:\n$$|f(v)| = \\left| \\int_{0}^{1} 1 \\cdot v(x) \\, dx \\right| \\leq \\left( \\int_{0}^{1} 1^{2} \\, dx \\right)^{1/2} \\left( \\int_{0}^{1} |v(x)|^{2} \\, dx \\right)^{1/2} = (1)^{1/2} \\|v\\|_{L^{2}} = \\|v\\|_{L^{2}}$$\nwhere $\\|v\\|_{L^{2}} = \\left( \\int_{0}^{1} |v(x)|^{2} \\, dx \\right)^{1/2}$. By the same logic as before, the $L^{2}$-norm of a function is bounded by its $H^{1}$-norm:\n$$\\|v\\|_{L^{2}} \\leq \\|v\\|_{V}$$\nTherefore, we have $|f(v)| \\leq \\|v\\|_{L^{2}} \\leq \\|v\\|_{V}$. This establishes that $f$ is a continuous linear functional on $V$ with a norm $\\|f\\|_{V^{\\ast}} \\leq 1$.\n\nSecond, for Task 2, we show that $a(\\cdot,\\cdot)$ is not coercive and determine its kernel. A bilinear form is coercive if there exists a constant $\\alpha > 0$ such that $a(v,v) \\geq \\alpha \\|v\\|_{V}^{2}$ for all $v \\in V$. The kernel of $a$, denoted $\\ker(a)$, can be defined as the set of elements $z \\in V$ such that $a(z,z) = 0$.\nFor our specific bilinear form, $a(v,v) = \\int_{0}^{1} |v'(x)|^{2} \\, dx$.\nThe condition $a(z,z) = 0$ is $\\int_{0}^{1} |z'(x)|^{2} \\, dx = 0$. Since the integrand $|z'(x)|^{2}$ is non-negative, the integral is zero if and only if $z'(x) = 0$ for almost every $x \\in (0,1)$. This implies that $z(x)$ must be a constant function, $z(x) = c$ for some $c \\in \\mathbb{R}$. Any such constant function has a finite $H^{1}$-norm: $\\|z\\|_{V}^{2} = \\int_{0}^{1} c^{2} \\, dx + \\int_{0}^{1} 0^{2} \\, dx = c^{2}$, so $z \\in V$. Thus, the kernel is the space of constant functions:\n$$\\ker(a) = \\{ z \\in H^{1}(0,1) \\mid z(x) = c, \\text{ for some } c \\in \\mathbb{R} \\}$$\nThis kernel is a non-trivial subspace of $V$. To show that $a(\\cdot,\\cdot)$ is not coercive, we choose any non-zero element from this kernel, for instance, $v(x) = 1$. For this function, we compute:\n$$a(v,v) = \\int_{0}^{1} (1')^{2} \\, dx = 0$$\n$$\\|v\\|_{V}^{2} = \\int_{0}^{1} 1^{2} \\, dx + \\int_{0}^{1} 0^{2} \\, dx = 1$$\nThe coercivity condition would require $0 \\geq \\alpha \\cdot 1$ for some $\\alpha > 0$, which is a clear contradiction. Thus, $a(\\cdot,\\cdot)$ is not coercive on $V = H^{1}(0,1)$.\n\nThird, for Task 3, we explain why the variational problem $a(u,v) = f(v)$ for all $v \\in V$ has no solution. The core of the argument rests on a compatibility condition. Suppose, for the sake of contradiction, that a solution $u \\in V$ exists. This means the equation $\\int_{0}^{1} u'(x) v'(x) \\, dx = \\int_{0}^{1} v(x) \\, dx$ must hold for all test functions $v \\in V$.\nLet us select a particular test function from the kernel of $a$, namely $v(x) = z(x) = 1$. Since $z \\in V$, the variational equation must hold for $v=z$. We evaluate the left-hand side (LHS) and right-hand side (RHS) of the equation for this choice.\nFor the LHS, we have:\n$$a(u,z) = \\int_{0}^{1} u'(x) z'(x) \\, dx = \\int_{0}^{1} u'(x) \\cdot \\frac{d}{dx}(1) \\, dx = \\int_{0}^{1} u'(x) \\cdot 0 \\, dx = 0$$\nFor the RHS, we have:\n$$f(z) = \\int_{0}^{1} z(x) \\, dx = \\int_{0}^{1} 1 \\, dx = 1$$\nEquating the LHS and RHS as per the variational problem, we arrive at the contradiction $0 = 1$. The initial assumption that a solution $u$ exists must be false. Therefore, the variational problem has no solution. The failure arises because the right-hand side functional $f$ is not orthogonal to the kernel of the operator $a$, in the sense that there exists $z \\in \\ker(a)$ for which $f(z) \\neq 0$.\n\nFourth, for Task 4, we verify the norm of $z(x) \\equiv 1$ and compute $f(z)$.\nThe squared norm of $z$ in $V=H^{1}(0,1)$ is:\n$$\\|z\\|_{V}^{2} = \\int_{0}^{1} |z(x)|^{2} \\, dx + \\int_{0}^{1} |z'(x)|^{2} \\, dx = \\int_{0}^{1} 1^{2} \\, dx + \\int_{0}^{1} 0^{2} \\, dx = 1 + 0 = 1$$\nHence, $\\|z\\|_{V} = \\sqrt{1} = 1$, which confirms that $z$ has unit norm in $V$.\nFinally, we compute the value of the functional $f$ applied to $z$:\n$$f(z) = \\int_{0}^{1} z(x) \\, dx = \\int_{0}^{1} 1 \\, dx = [x]_{0}^{1} = 1 - 0 = 1$$\nThis result, $f(z)=1$, was the critical non-zero value used in the contradiction argument of Task 3.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{1}$$", "id": "2556901"}, {"introduction": "In many physical applications, such as reaction-diffusion systems, lower-order terms can threaten the stability and, consequently, the coercivity of the associated bilinear form.

The eigenvalues are $\\lambda_k = (k\\pi)^2$ for $k \\in \\{1, 2, 3, \\dots\\}$, and the first (smallest) eigenvalue is $\\lambda_1 = \\pi^2$.\n\nThe Rayleigh quotient characterization states that this first eigenvalue is the minimum of the Rayleigh quotient over all admissible non-zero functions:\n$$\n\\lambda_1 = \\pi^2 = \\inf_{u \\in H_0^1(0,1)\\setminus\\{0\\}} \\frac{\\int_{0}^{1} (u'(x))^2 dx}{\\int_{0}^{1} (u(x))^2 dx} = \\inf_{u \\in V\\setminus\\{0\\}} \\frac{\\|u'\\|_{L^2(0,1)}^2}{\\|u\\|_{L^2(0,1)}^2}.\n$$\nThis minimum is attained by the first eigenfunction, $u_1(x) = \\sin(\\pi x)$. Let us evaluate $a(u_1, u_1)$. For $u_1(x) = \\sin(\\pi x)$, we have $u_1'(x) = \\pi\\cos(\\pi x)$.\nThe required norms are:\n$$\n\\|u_1'\\|_{L^2(0,1)}^2 = \\int_{0}^{1} (\\pi\\cos(\\pi x))^2 dx = \\pi^2 \\int_{0}^{1} \\cos^2(\\pi x) dx = \\pi^2 \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) = \\frac{\\pi^2}{2}.\n$$\n$$\n\\|u_1\\|_{L^2(0,1)}^2 = \\int_{0}^{1} \\sin^2(\\pi x) dx = \\frac{1}{2}.\n$$\nSubstituting these values into the quadratic form:\n$$\na(u_1, u_1) = \\frac{\\pi^2}{2} - 2\\pi^2 \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) = \\frac{\\pi^2}{2} - \\pi^2 = -\\frac{\\pi^2}{2}.\n$$\nThe coercivity condition for $u_1$ would require $a(u_1, u_1) \\ge \\alpha \\|u_1'\\|_{L^2(0,1)}^2$ for some $\\alpha > 0$. This implies $-\\frac{\\pi^2}{2} \\ge \\alpha \\frac{\\pi^2}{2}$, which simplifies to $-1 \\ge \\alpha$. This is a contradiction, as coercivity demands a strictly positive constant $\\alpha$. Therefore, the bilinear form $a(\\cdot,\\cdot)$ is not coercive on $V$.\n\n**Part 2: Determination of the Threshold $\\gamma_{\\ast}$**\n\nWe now consider the shifted bilinear form $a_{\\gamma}(u,v)$ and its corresponding quadratic form:\n$$\na_{\\gamma}(u,u) = a(u,u) + \\gamma \\int_{0}^{1} (u(x))^2 dx = \\|u'\\|_{L^2(0,1)}^2 - 2\\pi^2 \\|u\\|_{L^2(0,1)}^2 + \\gamma \\|u\\|_{L^2(0,1)}^2.\n$$\nThis simplifies to:\n$$\na_{\\gamma}(u,u) = \\|u'\\|_{L^2(0,1)}^2 + (\\gamma - 2\\pi^2) \\|u\\|_{L^2(0,1)}^2.\n$$\nWe seek the minimal $\\gamma_{\\ast}$ such that for all $\\gamma > \\gamma_{\\ast}$, there exists an $\\alpha > 0$ for which $a_{\\gamma}(u,u) \\ge \\alpha \\|u'\\|_{L^2(0,1)}^2$ for all $u \\in V$.\n\nThe Rayleigh quotient characterization $\\frac{\\|u'\\|_{L^2(0,1)}^2}{\\|u\\|_{L^2(0,1)}^2} \\ge \\pi^2$ is equivalent to the Poincaré inequality $\\|u\\|_{L^2(0,1)}^2 \\le \\frac{1}{\\pi^2}\\|u'\\|_{L^2(0,1)}^2$ for all $u \\in V$. We analyze two cases based on the sign of the coefficient $(\\gamma - 2\\pi^2)$.\n\nCase 1: $\\gamma - 2\\pi^2 \\ge 0$.\nIn this case, the term $(\\gamma - 2\\pi^2)\\|u\\|_{L^2(0,1)}^2$ is non-negative.\nTherefore, $a_{\\gamma}(u,u) = \\|u'\\|_{L^2(0,1)}^2 + (\\gamma - 2\\pi^2)\\|u\\|_{L^2(0,1)}^2 \\ge \\|u'\\|_{L^2(0,1)}^2$.\nWe can choose $\\alpha = 1$, which is positive. Thus, the form is coercive for any $\\gamma \\ge 2\\pi^2$.\n\nCase 2: $\\gamma - 2\\pi^2  0$.\nIn this case, the second term is negative. We use the Poincaré inequality to establish a lower bound.\n$$\n\\|u\\|_{L^2(0,1)}^2 \\le \\frac{1}{\\pi^2}\\|u'\\|_{L^2(0,1)}^2 \\implies -\\|u\\|_{L^2(0,1)}^2 \\ge -\\frac{1}{\\pi^2}\\|u'\\|_{L^2(0,1)}^2.\n$$\nSince $\\gamma - 2\\pi^2  0$, we can write $\\gamma - 2\\pi^2 = -(2\\pi^2 - \\gamma)$ where $2\\pi^2 - \\gamma > 0$.\n$$\na_{\\gamma}(u,u) = \\|u'\\|_{L^2(0,1)}^2 - (2\\pi^2 - \\gamma)\\|u\\|_{L^2(0,1)}^2 \\ge \\|u'\\|_{L^2(0,1)}^2 - (2\\pi^2 - \\gamma)\\frac{1}{\\pi^2}\\|u'\\|_{L^2(0,1)}^2.\n$$\nFactoring out $\\|u'\\|_{L^2(0,1)}^2$:\n$$\na_{\\gamma}(u,u) \\ge \\left(1 - \\frac{2\\pi^2 - \\gamma}{\\pi^2}\\right)\\|u'\\|_{L^2(0,1)}^2 = \\left(\\frac{\\pi^2 - 2\\pi^2 + \\gamma}{\\pi^2}\\right)\\|u'\\|_{L^2(0,1)}^2 = \\left(\\frac{\\gamma - \\pi^2}{\\pi^2}\\right)\\|u'\\|_{L^2(0,1)}^2.\n$$\nFor coercivity, the constant $\\alpha = \\frac{\\gamma - \\pi^2}{\\pi^2}$ must be strictly positive.\n$$\n\\frac{\\gamma - \\pi^2}{\\pi^2} > 0 \\implies \\gamma - \\pi^2 > 0 \\implies \\gamma > \\pi^2.\n$$\nCombining both cases, the form $a_{\\gamma}(\\cdot,\\cdot)$ is coercive if $\\gamma \\ge 2\\pi^2$ (from Case 1) or if $\\pi^2  \\gamma  2\\pi^2$ (from Case 2). The union of these conditions is $\\gamma > \\pi^2$.\n\nTo confirm that $\\pi^2$ is the minimal threshold, let us examine the case $\\gamma = \\pi^2$.\n$$\na_{\\pi^2}(u,u) = \\|u'\\|_{L^2(0,1)}^2 + (\\pi^2 - 2\\pi^2)\\|u\\|_{L^2(0,1)}^2 = \\|u'\\|_{L^2(0,1)}^2 - \\pi^2\\|u\\|_{L^2(0,1)}^2.\n$$\nFrom the Rayleigh quotient, we know $\\|u'\\|_{L^2(0,1)}^2 \\ge \\pi^2\\|u\\|_{L^2(0,1)}^2$, so $a_{\\pi^2}(u,u) \\ge 0$ for all $u \\in V$. However, for the first eigenfunction $u_1(x) = \\sin(\\pi x)$, the inequality becomes an equality: $\\|u_1'\\|_{L^2(0,1)}^2 = \\pi^2\\|u_1\\|_{L^2(0,1)}^2$.\nFor this function, $a_{\\pi^2}(u_1,u_1) = 0$. The coercivity condition $a_{\\pi^2}(u_1,u_1) \\ge \\alpha \\|u_1'\\|_{L^2(0,1)}^2$ becomes $0 \\ge \\alpha \\|u_1'\\|_{L^2(0,1)}^2$. Since $\\|u_1'\\|_{L^2(0,1)}^2 = \\frac{\\pi^2}{2} > 0$, this would force $\\alpha \\le 0$, which contradicts the requirement $\\alpha > 0$. Thus, for $\\gamma=\\pi^2$, the form is not coercive.\n\nFor any $\\gamma  \\pi^2$, we can again use the eigenfunction $u_1$ to show non-coercivity:\n$a_{\\gamma}(u_1,u_1) = \\|u_1'\\|_{L^2}^2 + (\\gamma - 2\\pi^2)\\|u_1\\|_{L^2}^2 = \\pi^2\\|u_1\\|_{L^2}^2 + (\\gamma - 2\\pi^2)\\|u_1\\|_{L^2}^2 = (\\gamma - \\pi^2)\\|u_1\\|_{L^2}^2  0$.\nA negative value for the quadratic form immediately violates the coercivity condition.\n\nTherefore, the shifted bilinear form $a_{\\gamma}(\\cdot,\\cdot)$ is coercive if and only if $\\gamma > \\pi^2$. The minimal threshold value $\\gamma_{\\ast}$ is the infimum of this set, which is $\\pi^2$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\pi^2}$$", "id": "2556917"}]}
