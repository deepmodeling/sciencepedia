It is a well-posed problem in the field of solid mechanics and the finite element method, based on established scientific principles. The problem is self-contained, consistent, and provides all necessary information to derive a unique solution for the requested quantities. The derivation shall proceed in two parts as requested.\n\nPart 1: Derivation of Membrane Force Resultants\n\nThe membrane force resultants, which are forces per unit length of the shell's mid-surface, are determined from static equilibrium of differential or finite sections of the shell. The problem specifies a closed-ended cylinder, which is critical for determining the meridional force.\n\nFirst, we derive the hoop (or circumferential) force resultant, $N_{\\theta}$. We consider a free-body diagram of a segment of the cylinder of axial length $L_{seg}$, cut by a plane through the central axis. The internal pressure $p$ acts radially outward. The resultant force from this pressure on the projected area, which is a rectangle of size $2R \\times L_{seg}$, must be balanced by the hoop forces acting on the two cut cross-sections of the shell wall.\nThe total force due to pressure is $F_p = p \\cdot (2R \\cdot L_{seg})$.\nThe total resisting force from the shell wall is $F_{wall} = 2 \\cdot (N_{\\theta} \\cdot L_{seg})$, where $N_{\\theta}$ is the hoop force per unit axial length.\nFor equilibrium:\n$$F_{wall} = F_p$$\n$$2 N_{\\theta} L_{seg} = 2 p R L_{seg}$$\nSolving for $N_{\\theta}$ yields:\n$$N_{\\theta} = pR$$\n\nNext, we derive the meridional (or axial) force resultant, $N_{\\phi}$. For a cylinder, the meridional direction corresponds to the axial direction. Since the cylinder is closed-ended, the internal pressure $p$ exerts a force on the circular end caps. We consider a free-body diagram created by a transverse cut through the cylinder, perpendicular to the $z$-axis. The total axial force due to the pressure acting on an end cap of area $\\pi R^2$ is $F_{axial} = p \\cdot (\\pi R^2)$. This force must be balanced by the meridional force resultant $N_{\\phi}$ integrated around the circumference of the cut, which is $2\\pi R$.\nThe total resisting force from the shell wall is $F_{wall} = N_{\\phi} \\cdot (2\\pi R)$.\nFor equilibrium in the axial direction:\n$$F_{wall} = F_{axial}$$\n$$N_{\\phi} (2\\pi R) = p(\\pi R^2)$$\nSolving for $N_{\\phi}$ yields:\n$$N_{\\phi} = \\frac{p \\pi R^2}{2\\pi R} = \\frac{pR}{2}$$\n\nPart 2: Derivation of the Consistent Nodal Load Vector\n\nThe consistent nodal load vector $\\mathbf{F}_e$ for an element is derived from the principle of virtual work. The virtual work done by external surface tractions $\\mathbf{t}$ is equivalent to the work done by the nodal forces $\\mathbf{F}_e$ through the virtual nodal displacements $\\delta\\mathbf{d}$. This relationship is expressed as:\n$$\\delta W_{ext} = \\delta\\mathbf{d}^T \\mathbf{F}_e = \\int_{\\Gamma_e} \\delta\\mathbf{u}^T \\mathbf{t} \\, d\\Gamma_e$$\nwhere $\\mathbf{u}$ is the displacement field, $\\delta\\mathbf{u}$ is the virtual displacement field, and $\\Gamma_e$ is the surface of the element over which the traction is applied. The displacement field is interpolated from nodal displacements using shape functions $\\mathbf{N}$ as $\\mathbf{u} = \\mathbf{N}\\mathbf{d}$, so $\\delta\\mathbf{u} = \\mathbf{N}\\delta\\mathbf{d}$. Substituting this into the virtual work equation gives:\n$$\\delta\\mathbf{d}^T \\mathbf{F}_e = \\int_{\\Gamma_e} (\\mathbf{N}\\delta\\mathbf{d})^T \\mathbf{t} \\, d\\Gamma_e = \\delta\\mathbf{d}^T \\int_{\\Gamma_e} \\mathbf{N}^T \\mathbf{t} \\, d\\Gamma_e$$\nFrom which we identify the consistent nodal load vector as:\n$$\\mathbf{F}_e = \\int_{\\Gamma_e} \\mathbf{N}^T \\mathbf{t} \\, d\\Gamma_e$$\nFor an axisymmetric element, the surface differential $d\\Gamma_e$ is given by $d\\Gamma_e = 2\\pi r \\, ds$, where $s$ is the coordinate along the meridian of the element. For the given straight cylindrical element, the radius $r$ is constant, $r=R$, and the meridional coordinate $s$ is the axial coordinate $z$, so $ds=dz$. The integration is performed over the length of the element, from $z=0$ to $z=L$.\n\nThe internal pressure $p$ acts normal to the inner surface. In the global $(r,z)$ cylindrical system with the outward normal in the $+r$ direction, the traction vector is $\\mathbf{t} = \\begin{pmatrix} p \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}$.\n\nThe element is a two-node linear element. The displacement components $u_r(z)$ and $u_z(z)$ are interpolated from the nodal values $(u_{r1}, u_{z1})$ at node $1$ ($z=0$) and $(u_{r2}, u_{z2})$ at node $2$ ($z=L$). The linear shape functions are:\n$$N_1(z) = 1 - \\frac{z}{L}$$\n$$N_2(z) = \\frac{z}{L}$$\nThe displacement interpolation is given by:\n$$\\begin{pmatrix} u_r(z) \\\\ u_z(z) \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} N_1(z) & 0 & N_2(z) & 0 \\\\ 0 & N_1(z) & 0 & N_2(z) \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} u_{r1} \\\\ u_{z1} \\\\ u_{r2} \\\\ u_{z2} \\end{pmatrix} = \\mathbf{N}(z) \\mathbf{d}$$\nThe nodal force vector $\\mathbf{F}_e = \\begin{pmatrix} F_{r1} & F_{z1} & F_{r2} & F_{z2} \\end{pmatrix}^T$ is then calculated as:\n$$\\mathbf{F}_e = \\int_{0}^{L} \\mathbf{N}(z)^T \\mathbf{t} (2\\pi R) \\, dz$$\n$$\\mathbf{F}_e = 2\\pi R \\int_{0}^{L} \\begin{pmatrix} N_1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & N_1 \\\\ N_2 & 0 \\\\ 0 & N_2 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} p \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix} dz = 2\\pi R p \\int_{0}^{L} \\begin{pmatrix} N_1(z) \\\\ 0 \\\\ N_2(z) \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix} dz$$\nWe must evaluate the integrals of the shape functions:\n$$\\int_{0}^{L} N_1(z) \\, dz = \\int_{0}^{L} \\left(1 - \\frac{z}{L}\\right) dz = \\left[z - \\frac{z^2}{2L}\\right]_{0}^{L} = L - \\frac{L^2}{2L} = \\frac{L}{2}$$\n$$\\int_{0}^{L} N_2(z) \\, dz = \\int_{0}^{L} \\frac{z}{L} \\, dz = \\left[\\frac{z^2}{2L}\\right]_{0}^{L} = \\frac{L^2}{2L} = \\frac{L}{2}$$\nSubstituting these results back into the expression for $\\mathbf{F}_e$:\n$$\\mathbf{F}_e = 2\\pi R p \\begin{pmatrix} L/2 \\\\ 0 \\\\ L/2 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\pi p R L \\\\ 0 \\\\ \\pi p R L \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}$$\nThus, the components of the nodal load vector are:\n$F_{r1} = \\pi p R L$\n$F_{z1} = 0$\n$F_{r2} = \\pi p R L$\n$F_{z2} = 0$\nThe total radial force applied to the element is $p \\cdot (2\\pi R L)$, which is correctly distributed as $\\pi p R L$ to each of the two nodes.
