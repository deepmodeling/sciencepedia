There are no contradictions. The linearity assumption is consistent with the properties of first-order Lagrange polynomials.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is scientifically sound, well-posed, and self-contained. It is a valid problem of fundamental importance in FEM. A solution will be provided.\n\n**Derivation of the Solution**\nThe task is to derive the Jacobian determinant $J(\\xi)$ for the specified one-dimensional linear element. The process begins with the explicit derivation of the shape functions $N_{1}(\\xi)$ and $N_{2}(\\xi)$ from first principles.\n\nGiven that the shape functions are linear, they can be expressed in the general form $N(\\xi) = a\\xi + b$, where $a$ and $b$ are constants.\n\nFor the first shape function, $N_{1}(\\xi)$, we apply the given nodal conditions:\n1.  $N_{1}(-1) = a_{1}(-1) + b_{1} = 1$\n2.  $N_{1}(1) = a_{1}(1) + b_{1} = 0$\n\nThis constitutes a system of two linear equations for the coefficients $a_{1}$ and $b_{1}$:\n$$\n\\begin{cases}\n-a_{1} + b_{1} = 1 \\\\\na_{1} + b_{1} = 0\n\\end{cases}\n$$\nAdding the two equations yields $2b_{1} = 1$, from which we find $b_{1} = \\frac{1}{2}$. Substituting this value into the second equation gives $a_{1} + \\frac{1}{2} = 0$, which results in $a_{1} = -\\frac{1}{2}$.\nThus, the first shape function is:\n$$\nN_{1}(\\xi) = -\\frac{1}{2}\\xi + \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{1}{2}(1 - \\xi)\n$$\n\nFor the second shape function, $N_{2}(\\xi)$, we apply its corresponding nodal conditions:\n1.  $N_{2}(-1) = a_{2}(-1) + b_{2} = 0$\n2.  $N_{2}(1) = a_{2}(1) + b_{2} = 1$\n\nThis gives the system of equations:\n$$\n\\begin{cases}\n-a_{2} + b_{2} = 0 \\\\\na_{2} + b_{2} = 1\n\\end{cases}\n$$\nAdding these equations yields $2b_{2} = 1$, so $b_{2} = \\frac{1}{2}$. Substituting this into the second equation gives $a_{2} + \\frac{1}{2} = 1$, from which we find $a_{2} = \\frac{1}{2}$.\nThus, the second shape function is:\n$$\nN_{2}(\\xi) = \\frac{1}{2}\\xi + \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{1}{2}(1 + \\xi)\n$$\n\nNow, we compute the Jacobian determinant, $J(\\xi) = \\frac{dx}{d\\xi}$. The mapping is given by $x(\\xi) = N_{1}(\\xi)X_{1} + N_{2}(\\xi)X_{2}$. Since $X_{1}$ and $X_{2}$ are constant nodal coordinates, the differentiation is with respect to $\\xi$ only:\n$$\nJ(\\xi) = \\frac{d}{d\\xi}\\left(N_{1}(\\xi)X_{1} + N_{2}(\\xi)X_{2}\\right) = \\frac{dN_{1}}{d\\xi}X_{1} + \\frac{dN_{2}}{d\\xi}X_{2}\n$$\nWe compute the derivatives of the shape functions:\n$$\n\\frac{dN_{1}}{d\\xi} = \\frac{d}{d\\xi}\\left(\\frac{1}{2}(1 - \\xi)\\right) = -\\frac{1}{2}\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{dN_{2}}{d\\xi} = \\frac{d}{d\\xi}\\left(\\frac{1}{2}(1 + \\xi)\\right) = \\frac{1}{2}\n$$\nSubstituting these constant derivatives into the expression for $J(\\xi)$:\n$$\nJ(\\xi) = \\left(-\\frac{1}{2}\\right)X_{1} + \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)X_{2} = \\frac{1}{2}(X_{2} - X_{1})\n$$\n\n**Analysis of the Jacobian**\nFrom the derived expression, we can make several observations.\n\nFirst, the Jacobian $J(\\xi)$ is independent of the reference coordinate $\\xi$. It is a constant for the entire element. This is a direct consequence of the linearity of the shape functions used for the isoparametric mapping.\n\nSecond, we relate $J$ to the oriented element length $L = X_{2} - X_{1}$ and the absolute element length $\\ell = |X_{2} - X_{1}|$.\nFrom our result, it is immediately clear that:\n$$\nJ = \\frac{L}{2}\n$$\nThe Jacobian determinant is half the oriented length of the element.\nConsequently, the absolute value of the Jacobian is:\n$$\n|J| = \\left|\\frac{L}{2}\\right| = \\frac{|L|}{2} = \\frac{|X_{2} - X_{1}|}{2} = \\frac{\\ell}{2}\n$$\n\nThird, the sign and magnitude of the Jacobian carry critical information about the quality of the mapping.\n-   **Sign of $J$**: The sign determines the orientation of the mapping.\n    -   If $J > 0$, then $X_{2} > X_{1}$. The mapping preserves orientation; as $\\xi$ increases from $-1$ to $1$, the physical coordinate $x$ increases from $X_{1}$ to $X_{2}$. This represents a valid, non-inverted element.\n    -   If $J < 0$, then $X_{2} < X_{1}$. The mapping reverses orientation; as $\\xi$ increases, $x$ decreases. The nodes are numbered in an order opposite to the direction of the physical coordinate system. This is an inverted element. While mathematically possible, it can cause significant issues in numerical computations, particularly in assembly of global matrices.\n    -   If $J = 0$, then $X_{2} = X_{1}$. The two nodes are coincident, meaning the element has zero length. The mapping collapses the entire reference domain $[-1, 1]$ to a single point. This is a degenerate mapping, which is singular and non-invertible. An element with $J=0$ is invalid for any finite element analysis.\n\n-   **Magnitude of $J$**: The magnitude $|J| = \\frac{\\ell}{2}$ is a differential scaling factor relating length in the reference domain to length in the physical domain. The relationship is $dx = J d\\xi$. The total length of the reference element is $1 - (-1) = 2$. The total length of the physical element is $\\ell$. The ratio of these lengths is $\\frac{\\ell}{2}$, which is precisely $|J|$. This constant scaling factor is used in numerical integration when transforming an integral over the physical element domain to an integral over the reference element domain: $\\int_{X_{1}}^{X_{2}} f(x) dx = \\int_{-1}^{1} f(x(\\xi)) J d\\xi$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\frac{1}{2}\\left(X_{2} - X_{1}\\right)}\n$$", "id": "2571710"}, {"introduction": "Having established the Jacobian's role in one dimension, we now advance to the two-dimensional bilinear quadrilateral, a workhorse element in finite element analysis.

We compute the length of each of the four edges, $\\ell_i$, using the Euclidean distance formula $\\ell = \\sqrt{\\Delta x^2 + \\Delta y^2}$.\n\nThe length of the first edge, $\\ell_1$, between node $1$ and node $2$ is:\n$$\n\\ell_1 = \\sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2} = \\sqrt{(a - 0)^2 + (0 - a)^2} = \\sqrt{a^2 + (-a)^2} = \\sqrt{2a^2} = a\\sqrt{2}\n$$\n\nThe length of the second edge, $\\ell_2$, between node $2$ and node $3$ is:\n$$\n\\ell_2 = \\sqrt{(x_3 - x_2)^2 + (y_3 - y_2)^2} = \\sqrt{(0 - a)^2 + (-a - 0)^2} = \\sqrt{(-a)^2 + (-a)^2} = \\sqrt{2a^2} = a\\sqrt{2}\n$$\n\nThe length of the third edge, $\\ell_3$, between node $3$ and node $4$ is:\n$$\n\\ell_3 = \\sqrt{(x_4 - x_3)^2 + (y_4 - y_3)^2} = \\sqrt{(-a - 0)^2 + (0 - (-a))^2} = \\sqrt{(-a)^2 + a^2} = \\sqrt{2a^2} = a\\sqrt{2}\n$$\n\nThe length of the fourth edge, $\\ell_4$, between node $4$ and node $1$ is:\n$$\n\\ell_4 = \\sqrt{(x_1 - x_4)^2 + (y_1 - y_4)^2} = \\sqrt{(0 - (-a))^2 + (a - 0)^2} = \\sqrt{a^2 + a^2} = \\sqrt{2a^2} = a\\sqrt{2}\n$$\n\nSince all edge lengths are equal, $\\ell_1 = \\ell_2 = \\ell_3 = \\ell_4 = a\\sqrt{2}$, the maximum and minimum lengths are identical. Therefore, the aspect ratio is:\n$$\nr = \\frac{\\max\\{\\ell_i\\}}{\\min\\{\\ell_i\\}} = \\frac{a\\sqrt{2}}{a\\sqrt{2}} = 1\n$$\nThis demonstrates that the element has a perfect aspect ratio of $1$.\n\nNext, we compute the Jacobian determinant. The isoparametric mapping from the reference coordinates $(\\xi, \\eta)$ to the physical coordinates $(x, y)$ is defined by:\n$$\nx(\\xi, \\eta) = \\sum_{i=1}^{4} N_i(\\xi, \\eta) x_i \\quad \\text{and} \\quad y(\\xi, \\eta) = \\sum_{i=1}^{4} N_i(\\xi, \\eta) y_i\n$$\nThe standard bilinear shape functions $N_i(\\xi, \\eta)$ for the reference square $[-1,1] \\times [-1,1]$ are associated with the nodes in counterclockwise order starting from $(\\xi, \\eta) = (-1,-1)$:\n$N_1(\\xi, \\eta) = \\frac{1}{4}(1-\\xi)(1-\\eta)$\n$N_2(\\xi, \\eta) = \\frac{1}{4}(1+\\xi)(1-\\eta)$\n$N_3(\\xi, \\eta) = \\frac{1}{4}(1+\\xi)(1+\\eta)$\n$N_4(\\xi, \\eta) = \\frac{1}{4}(1-\\xi)(1+\\eta)$\n\nSubstituting the given physical nodal coordinates:\n$x(\\xi, \\eta) = N_1(0) + N_2(a) + N_3(0) + N_4(-a) = a N_2 - a N_4$\n$y(\\xi, \\eta) = N_1(a) + N_2(0) + N_3(-a) + N_4(0) = a N_1 - a N_3$\n\nSubstituting the expressions for the shape functions:\n$$\nx(\\xi, \\eta) = a \\left( \\frac{1}{4}(1+\\xi)(1-\\eta) \\right) - a \\left( \\frac{1}{4}(1-\\xi)(1+\\eta) \\right) = \\frac{a}{4} ((1-\\eta+\\xi-\\xi\\eta) - (1+\\eta-\\xi-\\xi\\eta)) = \\frac{a}{4}(2\\xi - 2\\eta) = \\frac{a}{2}(\\xi - \\eta)\n$$\n$$\ny(\\xi, \\eta) = a \\left( \\frac{1}{4}(1-\\xi)(1-\\eta) \\right) - a \\left( \\frac{1}{4}(1+\\xi)(1+\\eta) \\right) = \\frac{a}{4} ((1-\\eta-\\xi+\\xi\\eta) - (1+\\eta+\\xi+\\xi\\eta)) = \\frac{a}{4}(-2\\eta - 2\\xi) = -\\frac{a}{2}(\\xi + \\eta)\n$$\nThe Jacobian matrix of the transformation is $J(\\xi, \\eta) = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{\\partial x}{\\partial \\xi} & \\frac{\\partial x}{\\partial \\eta} \\\\ \\frac{\\partial y}{\\partial \\xi} & \\frac{\\partial y}{\\partial \\eta} \\end{pmatrix}$. We compute the partial derivatives:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial x}{\\partial \\xi} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\xi}\\left(\\frac{a}{2}(\\xi - \\eta)\\right) = \\frac{a}{2}\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial x}{\\partial \\eta} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\eta}\\left(\\frac{a}{2}(\\xi - \\eta)\\right) = -\\frac{a}{2}\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial y}{\\partial \\xi} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\xi}\\left(-\\frac{a}{2}(\\xi + \\eta)\\right) = -\\frac{a}{2}\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial y}{\\partial \\eta} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\eta}\\left(-\\frac{a}{2}(\\xi + \\eta)\\right) = -\\frac{a}{2}\n$$\nThe Jacobian matrix is therefore constant over the entire element:\n$$\nJ = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{a}{2} & -\\frac{a}{2} \\\\ -\\frac{a}{2} & -\\frac{a}{2} \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe determinant of the Jacobian, $\\det(J)$, is:\n$$\n\\det(J) = \\left(\\frac{a}{2}\\right)\\left(-\\frac{a}{2}\\right) - \\left(-\\frac{a}{2}\\right)\\left(-\\frac{a}{2}\\right) = -\\frac{a^2}{4} - \\frac{a^2}{4} = -\\frac{2a^2}{4} = -\\frac{a^2}{2}\n$$\nSince the Jacobian determinant is constant, its value at the element center, $(\\xi, \\eta)=(0,0)$, is $-\\frac{a^2}{2}$. A negative Jacobian determinant indicates that the mapping is locally orientation-reversing, meaning the element is \"tangled\" or \"inverted\". This is an invalid element in the context of the finite element method. The exercise correctly demonstrates that a perfect geometric aspect ratio ($r=1$) does not guarantee a valid mapping.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{-\\frac{a^2}{2}}\n$$", "id": "2412959"}]}
