It is a standard exercise in the kinematics of continuum mechanics. I will proceed with the solution.\n\nThe task is twofold: first, to derive the Saint-Venant compatibility condition for a plane deformation from the fundamental definitions of the infinitesimal strain tensor components; second, to apply this condition to a specific strain field to determine if it is kinematically admissible.\n\nLet us begin with the derivation. The components of the infinitesimal strain tensor $\\varepsilon$ for a given two-dimensional displacement field $u(x,y) = (u_x(x,y), u_y(x,y))$ are given as:\n$$\n\\varepsilon_{xx} = \\frac{\\partial u_x}{\\partial x} \\quad (1)\n$$\n$$\n\\varepsilon_{yy} = \\frac{\\partial u_y}{\\partial y} \\quad (2)\n$$\n$$\n\\varepsilon_{xy} = \\frac{1}{2} \\left( \\frac{\\partial u_x}{\\partial y} + \\frac{\\partial u_y}{\\partial x} \\right) \\quad \\text{or} \\quad 2\\varepsilon_{xy} = \\frac{\\partial u_x}{\\partial y} + \\frac{\\partial u_y}{\\partial x} \\quad (3)\n$$\nThese three equations relate the three strain components to the two displacement components. For a given strain field $\\varepsilon_{xx}(x,y)$, $\\varepsilon_{yy}(x,y)$, $\\varepsilon_{xy}(x,y)$ to be derivable from a single-valued, continuous displacement field $u(x,y)$, the strain components cannot be independent. They must satisfy a certain condition, known as the compatibility condition. This condition arises from the mathematical requirement that the displacement field must be uniquely integrable from the strain field. This is ensured if the displacement components $u_x$ and $u_y$ can be eliminated from the system of equations $(1)$, $(2)$, and $(3)$.\n\nWe assume the displacement field is sufficiently smooth, specifically of class $C^3$, such that the order of partial differentiation is irrelevant (Clairaut's theorem on the equality of mixed partials). Our objective is to eliminate $u_x$ and $u_y$. We achieve this by taking appropriate partial derivatives of equations $(1)$, $(2)$, and $(3)$.\n\nDifferentiate equation $(1)$ twice with respect to $y$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial^2 \\varepsilon_{xx}}{\\partial y^2} = \\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial y^2} \\left( \\frac{\\partial u_x}{\\partial x} \\right) = \\frac{\\partial^3 u_x}{\\partial x \\partial y^2} \\quad (4)\n$$\nDifferentiate equation $(2)$ twice with respect to $x$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial^2 \\varepsilon_{yy}}{\\partial x^2} = \\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial x^2} \\left( \\frac{\\partial u_y}{\\partial y} \\right) = \\frac{\\partial^3 u_y}{\\partial y \\partial x^2} \\quad (5)\n$$\nNow, differentiate equation $(3)$ once with respect to $x$ and once with respect to $y$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} \\left( \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y} (2\\varepsilon_{xy}) \\right) = \\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial x \\partial y} \\left( \\frac{\\partial u_x}{\\partial y} + \\frac{\\partial u_y}{\\partial x} \\right)\n$$\n$$\n2 \\frac{\\partial^2 \\varepsilon_{xy}}{\\partial x \\partial y} = \\frac{\\partial^3 u_x}{\\partial x \\partial y^2} + \\frac{\\partial^3 u_y}{\\partial y \\partial x^2} \\quad (6)\n$$\nIn arriving at equation $(6)$, we have used the commutativity of mixed partial derivatives. For example, $\\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial x \\partial y} (\\frac{\\partial u_y}{\\partial x}) = \\frac{\\partial^3 u_y}{\\partial x^2 \\partial y}$, which is equal to $\\frac{\\partial^3 u_y}{\\partial y \\partial x^2}$ due to the smoothness assumption.\n\nWe now have expressions for the third-order partial derivatives of the displacement components in equations $(4)$ and $(5)$. Substituting these expressions into equation $(6)$ yields:\n$$\n2 \\frac{\\partial^2 \\varepsilon_{xy}}{\\partial x \\partial y} = \\frac{\\partial^2 \\varepsilon_{xx}}{\\partial y^2} + \\frac{\\partial^2 \\varepsilon_{yy}}{\\partial x^2}\n$$\nThis is the scalar Saint-Venant compatibility condition for plane deformation. Any kinematically admissible infinitesimal strain field must satisfy this equation. We can define the compatibility residual, $R(x,y)$, as the expression that must equal zero for compatibility to hold:\n$$\nR(x,y) \\equiv \\frac{\\partial^2 \\varepsilon_{xx}}{\\partial y^2} + \\frac{\\partial^2 \\varepsilon_{yy}}{\\partial x^2} - 2 \\frac{\\partial^2 \\varepsilon_{xy}}{\\partial x \\partial y} = 0\n$$\n\nThe second part of the problem requires us to apply this condition to the given strain field:\n$$\n\\varepsilon_{xx}(x,y) = 0\n$$\n$$\n\\varepsilon_{yy}(x,y) = 0\n$$\n$$\n\\varepsilon_{xy}(x,y) = xy\n$$\nThe coordinates $x$ and $y$ are specified as nondimensional. We compute the necessary second-order partial derivatives of these strain components.\n\nFor $\\varepsilon_{xx}$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial \\varepsilon_{xx}}{\\partial y} = 0 \\implies \\frac{\\partial^2 \\varepsilon_{xx}}{\\partial y^2} = 0\n$$\nFor $\\varepsilon_{yy}$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial \\varepsilon_{yy}}{\\partial x} = 0 \\implies \\frac{\\partial^2 \\varepsilon_{yy}}{\\partial x^2} = 0\n$$\nFor $\\varepsilon_{xy}$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial \\varepsilon_{xy}}{\\partial x} = y \\implies \\frac{\\partial^2 \\varepsilon_{xy}}{\\partial y \\partial x} = 1\n$$\nDue to smoothness of the field $xy$, we have $\\frac{\\partial^2 \\varepsilon_{xy}}{\\partial x \\partial y} = \\frac{\\partial^2 \\varepsilon_{xy}}{\\partial y \\partial x} = 1$.\n\nNow, we compute the compatibility residual $R(x,y)$ using these results:\n$$\nR(x,y) = (0) + (0) - 2(1) = -2\n$$\nThe compatibility residual is a constant value of $-2$.\n\nThe compatibility condition $R(x,y)=0$ is a necessary condition for a strain field to be derivable from a single-valued displacement field. In a simply connected domain, which is given in the problem statement, this condition is also sufficient.

The characteristic equation is $\\det(\\varepsilon - \\lambda I) = 0$:\n$$\n\\det \\begin{bmatrix} -\\lambda & \\alpha \\\\ \\alpha & -\\lambda \\end{bmatrix} = (-\\lambda)(-\\lambda) - (\\alpha)(\\alpha) = \\lambda^2 - \\alpha^2 = 0\n$$\nThis yields the principal strains $\\lambda_1 = \\alpha$ and $\\lambda_2 = -\\alpha$.\n\nThe principal directions are the corresponding eigenvectors.\nFor $\\lambda_1 = \\alpha$:\n$$\n(\\varepsilon - \\alpha I)v_1 = 0 \\implies \\begin{bmatrix} -\\alpha & \\alpha \\\\ \\alpha & -\\alpha \\end{bmatrix} \\begin{bmatrix} v_{1x} \\\\ v_{1y} \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} 0 \\\\ 0 \\end{bmatrix} \\implies -\\alpha v_{1x} + \\alpha v_{1y} = 0 \\implies v_{1x} = v_{1y}\n$$\nThe principal direction is along the vector $(1, 1)$, which makes an angle $\\theta_1 = \\arctan(1/1) = \\frac{\\pi}{4}$ with the $x$-axis.\nFor $\\lambda_2 = -\\alpha$:\n$$\n(\\varepsilon - (-\\alpha) I)v_2 = 0 \\implies \\begin{bmatrix} \\alpha & \\alpha \\\\ \\alpha & \\alpha \\end{bmatrix} \\begin{bmatrix} v_{2x} \\\\ v_{2y} \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} 0 \\\\ 0 \\end{bmatrix} \\implies \\alpha v_{2x} + \\alpha v_{2y} = 0 \\implies v_{2x} = -v_{2y}\n$$\nThe principal direction is along the vector $(1, -1)$, which makes an angle $\\theta_2 = \\arctan(-1/1) = -\\frac{\\pi}{4}$ with the $x$-axis.\nThe principal strains are $\\pm\\alpha$, oriented at angles $\\pm\\frac{\\pi}{4}$ to the original coordinate system.\n\nThe strain tensor $\\varepsilon$ is a real symmetric matrix, so according to the spectral theorem, it can always be diagonalized by an orthogonal transformation (a rotation). To find the rotation angle $\\theta$ that eliminates the off-diagonal (shear) components, we seek the angle that transforms the coordinate basis to the principal basis. The transformed shear strain $\\varepsilon'_{xy}$ is given by:\n$$\n\\varepsilon'_{xy} = -\\frac{\\varepsilon_{xx} - \\varepsilon_{yy}}{2} \\sin(2\\theta) + \\varepsilon_{xy} \\cos(2\\theta)\n$$\nWith $\\varepsilon_{xx}=0$, $\\varepsilon_{yy}=0$, and $\\varepsilon_{xy}=\\alpha$, we set $\\varepsilon'_{xy} = 0$:\n$$\n\\alpha \\cos(2\\theta) = 0 \\implies \\cos(2\\theta) = 0\n$$\nThis is satisfied when $2\\theta = \\frac{\\pi}{2} + k\\pi$ for any integer $k$. Thus, the required angles are $\\theta = \\frac{\\pi}{4} + k\\frac{\\pi}{2}$, where $k \\in \\mathbb{Z}$.\n\nFinally, we check the $2$D Saint-Venant compatibility condition:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial^2 \\varepsilon_{xx}}{\\partial y^2} + \\frac{\\partial^2 \\varepsilon_{yy}}{\\partial x^2} = 2 \\frac{\\partial^2 \\varepsilon_{xy}}{\\partial x \\partial y}\n$$\nThe strain components $\\varepsilon_{xx} = 0$, $\\varepsilon_{yy} = 0$, and $\\varepsilon_{xy} = \\alpha$ are all constants. Their second partial derivatives are therefore zero:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial^2 (0)}{\\partial y^2} + \\frac{\\partial^2 (0)}{\\partial x^2} = 2 \\frac{\\partial^2 (\\alpha)}{\\partial x \\partial y} \\implies 0 + 0 = 2 \\cdot 0\n$$\nThe condition $0=0$ is satisfied.

The strain tensor components should be $\\varepsilon_{xy}=\\alpha$, not $\\alpha/2$. Correspondingly, the rotation tensor should be the zero tensor. The assertion that no rotation can eliminate shear components contradicts the spectral theorem for symmetric matrices and is fundamentally incorrect. Finally, even with the given constant strain components, the compatibility condition would be satisfied, contrary to the claim.\n    **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n*   **C. $\\varepsilon=\\begin{bmatrix}0&0\\\\ 0&0\\end{bmatrix}$ and $\\omega=\\begin{bmatrix}0&\\alpha\\\\ -\\alpha&0\\end{bmatrix}$.

The claim that shear components are zero without rotation is false.

We now compute the row-wise curl of $\\boldsymbol{K}$. Since all components of $\\boldsymbol{K}$ are constant, the partial derivatives with respect to $x$, $y$, or $z$ of any component are zero.

This is expected, as all components of $\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}$ are at most linear in the coordinates, meaning all their second derivatives are zero, which trivially satisfies the standard Saint-Venant compatibility equations.\n\nPart 2: Reconstruction of the Displacement Field $\\boldsymbol{u}$\n\nLet the displacement field be $\\boldsymbol{u} = (u,v,w)^{\\mathsf{T}}$. The strain-displacement relations are:\n$\\varepsilon_{11} = \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x} = 2y$\n$\\varepsilon_{22} = \\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial y} = -z$\n$\\varepsilon_{33} = \\frac{\\partial w}{\\partial z} = 4x$\n$2\\varepsilon_{12} = \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial y} + \\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial x} = 2x$\n$2\\varepsilon_{13} = \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial z} + \\frac{\\partial w}{\\partial x} = 4z$\n$2\\varepsilon_{23} = \\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial z} + \\frac{\\partial w}{\\partial y} = -y$\n\nIntegrating the first three equations:\n$u(x,y,z) = \\int 2y \\, dx = 2xy + f(y,z)$\n$v(x,y,z) = \\int -z \\, dy = -yz + g(x,z)$\n$w(x,y,z) = \\int 4x \\, dz = 4xz + h(x,y)$\nwhere $f$, $g$, and $h$ are arbitrary functions of integration.\n\nSubstituting these into the shear strain relations:\n1. $\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial y} + \\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial x} = (2x + \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y}) + (\\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial x}) = 2x \\implies \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y} + \\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial x} = 0$.\n2. $\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial z} + \\frac{\\partial w}{\\partial x} = (\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial z}) + (4z + \\frac{\\partial h}{\\partial x}) = 4z \\implies \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial z} + \\frac{\\partial h}{\\partial x} = 0$.\n3. $\\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial z} + \\frac{\\partial w}{\\partial y} = (-y + \\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial z}) + (\\frac{\\partial h}{\\partial y}) = -y \\implies \\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial z} + \\frac{\\partial h}{\\partial y} = 0$.\n\nThis system defines the conditions for the functions $f(y,z)$, $g(x,z)$, and $h(x,y)$ which, in the context of infinitesimal displacements, represent an infinitesimal rigid body motion. The most general form of such a motion is a superposition of a constant translation and a constant infinitesimal rotation. The general solution for the integration functions is:\n$f(y,z) = -\\omega_z y + \\omega_y z + d_1$\n$g(x,z) = \\omega_z x - \\omega_x z + d_2$\n$h(x,y) = -\\omega_y x + \\omega_x y + d_3$\nwhere $d_1, d_2, d_3$ are constants representing a uniform translation, and $\\omega_x, \\omega_y, \\omega_z$ are constants representing an infinitesimal rotation.\n\nSubstituting these back gives the general solution for the displacement field $\\boldsymbol{u}$:\n$u(x,y,z) = 2xy - \\omega_z y + \\omega_y z + d_1$\n$v(x,y,z) = -yz + \\omega_z x - \\omega_x z + d_2$\n$w(x,y,z) = 4xz - \\omega_y x + \\omega_x y + d_3$\n\nNow, we apply the fixing conditions:\n1. $\\boldsymbol{u}(0,0,0) = \\boldsymbol{0}$: Substituting $x=y=z=0$ gives $\\boldsymbol{u}(0,0,0) = (d_1, d_2, d_3)^{\\mathsf{T}}$. Thus, $d_1=d_2=d_3=0$. The translational part of the rigid body motion is zero.\n2. \"No constant skew-symmetric linear term is added to $\\boldsymbol{u}$\": The general solution is a sum of a particular solution $\\boldsymbol{u}_p = (2xy, -yz, 4xz)^{\\mathsf{T}}$ and a rigid body motion term $\\boldsymbol{u}_{RBM}$. The term $\\boldsymbol{u}_{RBM} = (-\\omega_z y + \\omega_y z, \\omega_z x - \\omega_x z, -\\omega_y x + \\omega_x y)^{\\mathsf{T}}$ is the linear function of coordinates representing the rotation. Its gradient is a constant skew-symmetric matrix. The condition states this term is zero. This requires $\\boldsymbol{u}_{RBM}(\\boldsymbol{x}) = \\boldsymbol{0}$ for all $\\boldsymbol{x}$, which implies $\\omega_x=\\omega_y=\\omega_z=0$.\n\nWith all constants of integration determined to be zero, the unique displacement field is:\n$u(x,y,z) = 2xy$\n$v(x,y,z) = -yz$\n$w(x,y,z) = 4xz$\n\nWe check this result.\n$\\nabla\\boldsymbol{u} = \\begin{pmatrix} 2y & 2x & 0 \\\\ 0 & -z & -y \\\\ 4z & 0 & 4x \\end{pmatrix}$.\n$\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon} = \\frac{1}{2}(\\nabla\\boldsymbol{u} + \\nabla\\boldsymbol{u}^{\\mathsf{T}}) = \\frac{1}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 4y & 2x & 4z \\\\ 2x & -2z & -y \\\\ 4z & -y & 8x \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 2y & x & 2z \\\\ x & -z & -y/2 \\\\ 2z & -y/2 & 4x \\end{pmatrix}$.\nThis matches the given strain tensor. The solution is correct.\n\nFinal result for the displacement field components is $\\boldsymbol{u}(x,y,z) = (2xy, -yz, 4xz)^{\\mathsf{T}}$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n2xy & -yz & 4xz\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "2569252"}]}
