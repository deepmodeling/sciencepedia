The objective is to perform a standard derivation and apply it to a simple, illustrative case. A unique and meaningful solution exists.\n-   **Objectivity**: The language is precise and free of subjective or ambiguous terminology.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is found to be valid. It is a standard, fundamental exercise in continuum mechanics. Proceeding with the solution.\n\nThe solution is developed as follows.\n\nThe motion of a point in the one-dimensional body is described by its final position $x$ as a function of its initial position $X$ in the reference configuration. This is given by the mapping $x(X) = X + u(X)$, where $u(X)$ is the displacement field.\n\nFirst, we define the deformation gradient, $F$. In one dimension, this is a scalar quantity defined as the derivative of the current position with respect to the reference position:\n$$\nF = \\frac{dx}{dX}\n$$\nSubstituting the given mapping $x(X)$:\n$$\nF = \\frac{d}{dX} (X + u(X)) = 1 + \\frac{du}{dX}\n$$\nThe term $\\frac{du}{dX}$ is the displacement gradient.\n\nNext, we introduce the Green–Lagrange strain tensor, $\\mathbf{E}$. In a general three-dimensional setting, it is defined as $\\mathbf{E} = \\frac{1}{2}(\\mathbf{F}^T \\mathbf{F} - \\mathbf{I})$, where $\\mathbf{F}$ is the deformation gradient tensor and $\\mathbf{I}$ is the identity tensor. For our one-dimensional case, this definition simplifies to a scalar equation:\n$$\nE = \\frac{1}{2}(F^2 - 1)\n$$\nThis strain measure is defined with respect to the reference (Lagrangian) configuration and is geometrically exact, meaning it is valid for arbitrarily large deformations and rotations.\n\nSubstituting the expression for $F$ into the equation for $E$:\n$$\nE = \\frac{1}{2} \\left( \\left(1 + \\frac{du}{dX}\\right)^2 - 1 \\right)\n$$\nExpanding the squared term:\n$$\nE = \\frac{1}{2} \\left( 1 + 2\\frac{du}{dX} + \\left(\\frac{du}{dX}\\right)^2 - 1 \\right)\n$$\nSimplifying the expression yields the exact one-dimensional Green–Lagrange strain:\n$$\nE = \\frac{du}{dX} + \\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\frac{du}{dX}\\right)^2\n$$\nThis is a nonlinear function of the displacement gradient.\n\nThe problem requires the derivation of the small or infinitesimal strain, denoted here by $\\epsilon$. This is obtained by linearizing the Green–Lagrange strain $E$ under the assumption of small deformations. The small deformation kinematics implies that the magnitude of the displacement gradient is much less than unity:\n$$\n\\left|\\frac{du}{dX}\\right| \\ll 1\n$$\nUnder this condition, the quadratic term $\\left(\\frac{du}{dX}\\right)^2$ is negligible in comparison to the linear term $\\frac{du}{dX}$. By neglecting this higher-order term, we arrive at the linearized strain, also known as the infinitesimal strain or Cauchy strain:\n$$\n\\epsilon \\approx \\frac{du}{dX}\n$$\nThis is the fundamental strain-displacement relation for small deformations in one dimension.\n\nNow, we apply this result to the specified affine displacement field:\n$$\nu(X) = aX + b\n$$\nThe constants $a$ and $b$ are given, with the constraint $|a| \\ll 1$. We compute the displacement gradient:\n$$\n\\frac{du}{dX} = \\frac{d}{dX}(aX + b) = a\n$$\nSubstituting this result into the expression for infinitesimal strain $\\epsilon$:\n$$\n\\epsilon = a\n$$\nThe strain is a constant value $a$, independent of the material coordinate $X$. This is consistent with the problem's request for the \"constant infinitesimal strain.\" The condition $|a| \\ll 1$ validates the use of the small-strain approximation, as it directly corresponds to $|\\frac{du}{dX}| \\ll 1$. The strain $a$ is a dimensionless quantity, representing the change in length per unit original length.\n\nFinally, we provide a physical interpretation of the constants $a$ and $b$.\n-   The constant $a$ is the infinitesimal strain $\\epsilon$. It represents a uniform deformation of the bar. If $a > 0$, the bar undergoes uniform extension (stretching). If $a < 0$, the bar undergoes uniform compression. The displacement component $aX$ is responsible for this change in the bar's length.\n-   The constant $b$ represents a uniform displacement of every material point in the bar. The entire bar is shifted rigidly along the axis by a distance $b$ without any change in its length, shape, or orientation. This is a rigid-body translation. It does not induce any strain, as is evident from the fact that it disappears upon differentiation with respect to $X$.\n\nThe final answer required is the value of the constant infinitesimal strain in terms of $a$ only. As derived, this value is $a$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{a}\n$$", "id": "2601702"}, {"introduction": "Building upon the one-dimensional foundation, we extend our analysis to a two-dimensional continuum.
