The path of these rays is governed by Snell's Law at the interface between two media. If a ray passes from a medium with acoustic refractive index $n_1$ to a medium with index $n_2$, the angles of incidence ($\\theta_1$) and refraction ($\\theta_2$) relative to the surface normal are related by $n_1 \\sin \\theta_1 = n_2 \\sin \\theta_2$.\n\nA critical phenomenon known as Total Internal Reflection (TIR) occurs when a ray travels from a medium with a higher refractive index to one with a lower refractive index (i.e., $n_1 > n_2$). If the angle of incidence $\\theta_1$ exceeds a certain critical angle $\\theta_c$, the ray is entirely reflected back into the first medium and does not escape. The critical angle is given by $\\sin \\theta_c = n_2/n_1$.\n\nConsider a spherical droplet of a special fluid with radius $R$ and a constant acoustic refractive index $n_1$.

Express your answer in terms of the refractive indices $n_1$ and $n_2$.", "solution": "The problem asks for the maximum distance $d_{max}$ a point source can be from the center of a sphere of radius $R$ and refractive index $n_1$ such that all its rays escape into a surrounding medium of refractive index $n_2$, where $n_1 > n_2$.\n\n**1. Condition for Ray Escape**\n\nFor all rays to escape, none of them can undergo Total Internal Reflection (TIR). The condition for TIR is that the angle of incidence $\\theta_1$ at the boundary must be greater than or equal to the critical angle $\\theta_c$. The critical angle is defined by Snell's law at the limit of refraction, $\\theta_2 = \\pi/2$:\n$$n_1 \\sin \\theta_c = n_2 \\sin(\\pi/2)$$\n$$\\sin \\theta_c = \\frac{n_2}{n_1}$$\nFor all rays to escape, the angle of incidence $\\theta_1$ for every possible ray must be strictly less than $\\theta_c$. This must hold even for the ray with the largest possible angle of incidence, which we will call $\\theta_{1, \\text{max}}$. Therefore, the condition for all rays to escape is:\n$$\\theta_{1, \\text{max}} < \\theta_c$$\nThe problem asks for the maximum placement distance, $d_{max}$, which corresponds to the limiting case where the ray with the maximum angle of incidence is just at the critical angle. Thus, we will solve for the condition:\n$$\\theta_{1, \\text{max}}(d_{max}) = \\theta_c$$\nTaking the sine of both sides, this is equivalent to:\n$$\\sin(\\theta_{1, \\text{max}}) = \\sin(\\theta_c) = \\frac{n_2}{n_1}$$\n\n**2. Geometric Analysis to find $\\theta_{1, \\text{max}}$**\n\nLet's establish a geometric model to find the maximum angle of incidence, $\\theta_{1, \\text{max}}$, for a source at a distance $d$ from the center.\n- Let the center of the sphere be the origin, $O$.\n- Let the point source be located at point $S$, at a distance $d$ from $O$. We can place $S$ on an axis without loss of generality.\n- a ray from $S$ strikes the surface of the sphere at a point $P$. The distance from the center to this point is the radius, $|OP| = R$.\n- The incident ray travels along the line segment $SP$.\n- The normal to the spherical surface at $P$ is along the radial line $OP$.\n- The angle of incidence, $\\theta_1$, is the angle between the incident ray $SP$ and the normal $OP$. Thus, $\\theta_1 = \\angle OPS$.\n\nThis defines a triangle $\\triangle OSP$ with vertices at the center of the sphere ($O$), the source ($S$), and the point of incidence on the surface ($P$). The side lengths are $|OS| = d$ and $|OP| = R$.\n\nWe want to find the maximum possible value of the angle $\\theta_1 = \\angle OPS$ as the point $P$ varies over the surface of the sphere. We can use the Law of Sines in $\\triangle OSP$:\n$$\\frac{|OS|}{\\sin(\\angle OPS)} = \\frac{|OP|}{\\sin(\\angle OSP)}$$\nSubstituting the known quantities:\n$$\\frac{d}{\\sin \\theta_1} = \\frac{R}{\\sin(\\angle OSP)}$$\nSolving for $\\sin \\theta_1$:\n$$\\sin \\theta_1 = \\frac{d}{R} \\sin(\\angle OSP)$$\nTo maximize $\\sin \\theta_1$ (for $\\theta_1 \\in [0, \\pi/2]$), we need to maximize $\\sin(\\angle OSP)$. The sine function has a maximum value of 1. This maximum is achieved when the angle is $\\pi/2$:\n$$\\sin(\\angle OSP)_{max} = 1 \\quad \\text{at} \\quad \\angle OSP = \\pi/2$$\nThis geometric configuration corresponds to the ray $SP$ being emitted perpendicular to the line $OS$ connecting the center to the source.\n\nThe maximum value for $\\sin \\theta_1$ is therefore:\n$$\\sin(\\theta_{1, \\text{max}}) = \\frac{d}{R} \\times 1 = \\frac{d}{R}$$\n\n**3. Deriving the Maximum Distance $d_{max}$**\n\nNow we combine the results from steps 1 and 2. We set the maximum sine of the angle of incidence equal to the sine of the critical angle. Let $d = d_{max}$ for this limiting case.\n$$\\sin(\\theta_{1, \\text{max}}) = \\frac{d_{max}}{R}$$\n$$\\sin(\\theta_c) = \\frac{n_2}{n_1}$$\nEquating these two expressions:\n$$\\frac{d_{max}}{R} = \\frac{n_2}{n_1}$$\nThis is the desired expression for the maximum normalized distance from the center. If the source is placed at any distance $d \\le d_{max}$, all rays will escape. If $d > d_{max}$, there will be a cone of rays around the line extending from $O$ through $S$ that will be trapped by total internal reflection.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{n_2}{n_1}}$$", "id": "547745"}, {"introduction": "While single interfaces are instructive, many real-world environments like the ocean or atmosphere feature properties that change continuously.
