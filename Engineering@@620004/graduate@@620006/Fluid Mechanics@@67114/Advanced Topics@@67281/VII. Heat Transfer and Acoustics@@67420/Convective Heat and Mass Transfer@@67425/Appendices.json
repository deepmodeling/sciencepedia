The following simplifying assumptions are to be used:\n1.  The temperature within the particle is spatially uniform at any instant in time (i.e., the lumped capacitance model is applicable).\n2.  The heat transfer coefficient at the particle's surface is determined by the limiting case of pure conduction into an infinite stationary medium, for which the Nusselt number is given by $Nu_D = 2$.\n\nBased on these principles, derive the analytical expression for the temperature of the particle, $T(t)$, as a function of time $t$.", "solution": "1.
