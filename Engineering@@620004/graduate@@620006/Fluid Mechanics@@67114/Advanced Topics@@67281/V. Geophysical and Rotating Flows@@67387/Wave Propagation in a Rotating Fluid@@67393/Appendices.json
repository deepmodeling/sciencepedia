The condition of phase continuity at the boundary $z=0$ requires that the phase of the incident and reflected waves match for all $x$, $y$, and $t$.

To select the correct sign, we use the physical condition on energy propagation. The group velocity's vertical component, $v_{gz}$, determines the direction of vertical energy transport.
