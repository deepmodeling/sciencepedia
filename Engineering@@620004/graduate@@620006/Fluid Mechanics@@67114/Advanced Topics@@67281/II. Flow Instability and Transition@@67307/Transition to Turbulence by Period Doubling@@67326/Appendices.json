This theory introduces a \"doubling\" operator, $\\mathcal{T}$, which acts on a function $f$. A key insight is that the universal properties of the cascade are encoded in the fixed point of this operator, a universal function $g(x)$ that satisfies the functional equation $g(x) = (\\mathcal{T}g)(x)$.
