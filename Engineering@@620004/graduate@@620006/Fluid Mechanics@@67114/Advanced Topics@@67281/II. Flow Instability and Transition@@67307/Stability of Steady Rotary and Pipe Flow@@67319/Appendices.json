Since $\\Omega_1 > \\Omega_2$ and $r_1 < r_2$, both the numerator and denominator are positive. So, $B > 0$.\n-   The fluid is shear-thinning, so $n < 1$. This implies $1/n > 1$, and $(1-1/n) < 0$. Therefore, $(2-2/n) = 2(1-1/n) < 0$.\n\nThe sign of the derivative is $\\frac{dg}{dr} = (\\text{negative factor}) \\cdot B \\cdot (2-2/n) \\cdot (\\text{positive term}) = (-) \\cdot (+) \\cdot (-) \\cdot (+) > 0$.\nSince $\\frac{dg}{dr} > 0$, the function $g(r)$ is monotonically increasing with $r$. For $g(r)$ to be positive throughout the interval $[r_1, r_2]$, it is sufficient that its minimum value is positive. The minimum occurs at the left boundary, $r = r_1$.\nThus, the condition for stability is $g(r_1) > 0$. The marginal stability boundary is defined by the condition $g(r_1) = 0$.\n\n**4.
