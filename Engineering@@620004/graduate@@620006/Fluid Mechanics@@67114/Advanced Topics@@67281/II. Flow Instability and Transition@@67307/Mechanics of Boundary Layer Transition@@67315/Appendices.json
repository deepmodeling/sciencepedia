Primes denote differentiation with respect to $y$. The flow is unstable if the imaginary part of the wave speed, $c_i$, is positive. A necessary condition for inviscid instability is Rayleigh's inflection point criterion, which states that $U''(y)$ must be zero for some $y$ in the flow domain.\n\nConsider the family of Falkner-Skan boundary layer profiles, which are similarity solutions described by the pressure gradient parameter $\\beta$.
