When the temperature difference $\\Delta T = T_0 - T_1$ is sufficiently large, the quiescent state becomes unstable and convection begins. This phenomenon is known as Darcy-Bénard convection.\n\nWithin the Boussinesq approximation, the state of marginal stability (the onset of convection) for disturbances of the form $f(z)e^{i(k_x x + k_y y)}$ is described by the following system of linear, non-dimensionalized ordinary differential equations for the amplitude of the vertical velocity, $W(z)$, and the temperature perturbation, $\\Theta(z)$:\n$$\n\\left(\\frac{d^2}{dz^2} - a^2\\right) \\Theta(z) = -W(z)\n$$\n$$\n\\left(\\frac{d^2}{dz^2} - a^2\\right) W(z) = -Ra_D \\, a^2 \\, \\Theta(z)\n$$\nHere, $z \\in [0, 1]$ is the dimensionless vertical coordinate, $a$ is the dimensionless horizontal wavenumber of the disturbance, and $Ra_D$ is the Darcy-Rayleigh number, defined as:\n$$\nRa_D = \\frac{g \\alpha (\\Delta T) K d}{\\nu \\kappa_m}\n$$\nwhere $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity, $\\alpha$ is the thermal expansion coefficient, $K$ is the permeability of the porous medium, $\\nu$ is the kinematic viscosity of the fluid, and $\\kappa_m$ is the effective thermal diffusivity of the saturated medium.\n\nThe boundary conditions are as follows:\n1.  The plates are impermeable, which implies that the vertical velocity must vanish at the boundaries: $W(0) = 0$ and $W(1) = 0$.\n2.  The plates are held at constant temperatures, which means the temperature perturbation must vanish at the boundaries: $\\Theta(0) = 0$ and $\\Theta(1) = 0$.\n\nFor a given wavenumber $a$, a non-trivial solution exists only for a specific value of $Ra_D$.
