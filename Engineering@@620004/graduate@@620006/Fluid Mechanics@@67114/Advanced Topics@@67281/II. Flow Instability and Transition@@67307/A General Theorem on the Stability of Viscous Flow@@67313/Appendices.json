The flow is governed by the Navier-Stokes equations. We analyze the stability of a simple parallel shear flow, given by the velocity profile $\\mathbf{U} = (Sy, 0, 0)$, where $S$ is a constant positive shear rate. We introduce a small perturbation to this base flow, such that the total velocity is $\\mathbf{u}_{total} = \\mathbf{U} + \\mathbf{u}'$ and the total pressure is $p_{total} = P_{base} + p'$, where $\\mathbf{u}'=(u',v',w')$ and $p'$ are the perturbation velocity and pressure, respectively.\n\nThe evolution of this perturbation is studied within the framework of linearized stability theory. A crucial simplification is made by considering perturbations that are independent of the streamwise coordinate, $x$, i.e., $\\mathbf{u}' = \\mathbf{u}'(y,z,t)$ and $p' = p'(y,z,t)$. Under this assumption, the linearized Navier-Stokes equations for the perturbation components are:\n1.

A fundamental mechanism for transient energy growth in shear flows, known as the \"lift-up effect\", can be analyzed using this system. This effect describes the generation of strong streamwise velocity perturbations (streaks) from initial cross-stream velocity perturbations (vortices).\n\n**Problem:**\nSuppose at time $t=0$, the flow is perturbed by an initial streamwise vortex structure, such that the initial streamwise velocity perturbation is zero, $u'(y,z,t=0) = 0$, while the initial cross-stream velocity components $v'(y,z,t=0)$ and $w'(y,z,t=0)$ are non-zero.

This simplifies the equation to:\n$$ \\frac{df}{dt}v' = -S v' $$\nSince $v'$ is not identically zero, we can divide by it to obtain an ordinary differential equation for $f(t)$:\n$$ \\frac{df}{dt} = -S $$\nIntegrating with respect to time gives:\n$$ f(t) = -St + C $$\nwhere $C$ is the integration constant. So, the solution is of the form $u'(y,z,t) = (-St + C)v'(y,z,t)$.\n\nTo find the constant $C$, we apply the initial condition $u'(t=0) = 0$:\n$$ u'(y,z,0) = (-S \\cdot 0 + C)v'(y,z,0) = C v_0(y,z) $$\nFor $u'(y,z,0)=0$ with a non-trivial initial vortex field ($v_0 \\neq 0$), we must have $C=0$.\n\nTherefore, the function is $f(t) = -St$, and the relationship between $u'$ and $v'$ is:\n$$ u'(y,z,t) = -S t \\, v'(y,z,t) $$\n\n**4. Determine the requested ratio**\n\nThe problem asks for the ratio $\\frac{u'(y,z,t)}{v'(y,z,t)}$. Using the result from the previous step, we divide by $v'(y,z,t)$ (which is assumed to be non-zero):\n$$ \\frac{u'(y,z,t)}{v'(y,z,t)} = -S t $$\nThis shows that the streamwise velocity perturbation generated by the lift-up effect grows linearly with time relative to the decaying wall-normal perturbation.", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{-St} $$", "id": "452090"}, {"introduction": "In many natural settings, such as the atmosphere and oceans, fluid density varies with height, a property known as stratification.
