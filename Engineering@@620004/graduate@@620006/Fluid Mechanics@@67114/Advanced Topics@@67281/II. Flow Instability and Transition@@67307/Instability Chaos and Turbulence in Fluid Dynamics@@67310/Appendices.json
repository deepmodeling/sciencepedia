By working through this problem, you will use the principles of linear stability theory to calculate the critical Taylor number, $Ta_c$, which pinpoints the exact threshold for this transition, providing a tangible link between mathematical analysis and a fundamental physical phenomenon.

For a narrow gap between the cylinders, a linear stability analysis for stationary, axisymmetric disturbances (Taylor vortices) leads to a condition for marginal stability.

The Taylor number is a dimensionless quantity that characterizes the importance of centrifugal forces relative to viscous forces.\n\nThe marginal stability criterion, derived from the linearized Navier-Stokes equations under the narrow-gap approximation, is given by the following relation:\n$$\nTa = \\frac{(b + a^2)^3}{a^2}\n$$\nHere, $a = kd$ is the dimensionless axial wavenumber of the disturbance, where $k$ is the dimensional wavenumber and $d$ is the width of the gap between the cylinders. The parameter $b$ represents the contribution from the radial structure of the disturbance. For the simplest set of physically relevant boundary conditions (e.g., free-slip surfaces), the radial modes are quantized such that $b = (n\\pi)^2$, where $n$ is a positive integer ($n=1, 2, 3, \\dots$) corresponding to the number of cells in the radial direction.\n\nThe flow becomes unstable when the Taylor number exceeds a critical value, $Ta_c$.

This practice delves into the Standard Map, a cornerstone model for Hamiltonian chaos, to explore the concept of resonance overlap. You will derive the famous Chirikov criterion, which predicts the onset of global chaos by determining when stable \"islands\" in phase space grow large enough to touch, breaking down the barriers to chaotic motion and allowing trajectories to wander unpredictably. [@problem_id:535883]", "problem": "The standard map, also known as the Chirikov-Taylor map, is a cornerstone model in the study of Hamiltonian chaos.

As $K$ increases, the system transitions to global chaos. This transition is often explained by the overlap of resonance islands. Resonances occur at momentum values $p_m = 2\\pi m$ (for integer $m$), where the rotator's period becomes commensurate with the period of the kicks. Around these resonant momenta, the dynamics are trapped in stable regions called resonance islands.\n\nThe dynamics within a resonance island can be approximated by a continuous pendulum Hamiltonian.

The Chirikov resonance overlap criterion provides an estimate for the onset of global chaos by determining the value of $K$ at which adjacent primary resonance islands begin to overlap.\n\nYour task is to derive the critical value, $K_c$, for the onset of global chaos according to this criterion.

Apply the Chirikov criterion, which states that chaos becomes widespread when the sum of the half-widths of two adjacent resonance islands equals the distance between their centers. Using the primary resonances at $m=0$ and $m=1$, derive the critical value $K_c$.", "solution": "The problem asks for the derivation of the Chirikov criterion value $K_c$ for the standard map. The derivation proceeds in four steps as outlined.\n\n**Step 1: Approximate dynamics near a resonance**\n\nThe standard map is given by:\n$$\np_{n+1} = p_n + K \\sin(\\theta_n)\n$$\n$$\n\\theta_{n+1} = \\theta_n + p_{n+1}\n$$\nThe primary resonances are located at $p_m = 2\\pi m$ for integer $m$. We analyze the dynamics near one such resonance by letting $p_n = p_m + \\Delta p_n = 2\\pi m + \\Delta p_n$, where $\\Delta p_n$ is assumed to be small.\n\nSubstituting this into the map equations:\n$$\n2\\pi m + \\Delta p_{n+1} = 2\\pi m + \\Delta p_n + K \\sin(\\theta_n)\n$$\n$$\n\\implies \\Delta p_{n+1} = \\Delta p_n + K \\sin(\\theta_n)\n$$\nFor the angle variable:\n$$\n\\theta_{n+1} = \\theta_n + p_{n+1} = \\theta_n + 2\\pi m + \\Delta p_{n+1}\n$$\nSince $\\theta$ is defined modulo $2\\pi$, the $2\\pi m$ term can be dropped:\n$$\n\\theta_{n+1} = \\theta_n + \\Delta p_{n+1}\n$$\nThe map for the deviation variables $(\\Delta p, \\theta)$ is identical in form to the original standard map. This means all primary resonance islands have the same structure and width. We can therefore analyze the central resonance at $m=0$ (i.e., $p_0=0$) without loss of generality, and we can write $p$ for $\\Delta p$.\n\nFor slow evolution near the resonance (small $p$ and $K$), we can approximate the discrete map by a set of continuous differential equations, where the discrete step $n$ becomes a continuous time variable $t$:\n$$\n\\frac{dp}{dt} \\approx p_{n+1} - p_n = K \\sin(\\theta)\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{d\\theta}{dt} \\approx \\theta_{n+1} - \\theta_n = p_{n+1} \\approx p_n = p\n$$\nSo we have the system:\n$$\n\\frac{dp}{dt} = K \\sin(\\theta)\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{d\\theta}{dt} = p\n$$\n\n**Step 2: Effective Hamiltonian**\n\nWe seek a Hamiltonian $H(p, \\theta)$ that generates these equations of motion via Hamilton's equations:\n$$\n\\frac{dp}{dt} = -\\frac{\\partial H}{\\partial \\theta}, \\quad \\frac{d\\theta}{dt} = \\frac{\\partial H}{\\partial p}\n$$\nComparing with our derived differential equations:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial H}{\\partial p} = p \\implies H(p, \\theta) = \\frac{p^2}{2} + f(\\theta)\n$$\nfor some function $f(\\theta)$.

This region is bounded by a separatrix trajectory, which separates libration from rotation. The separatrix passes through the unstable fixed points (saddle points) of the Hamiltonian flow.\n\nThe fixed points occur where $\\dot{p}=0$ and $\\dot{\\theta}=0$.\n$\\dot{p} = K\\sin\\theta = 0 \\implies \\theta = 0, \\pi$.\n$\\dot{\\theta} = p = 0$.\nThe fixed points are $(p, \\theta) = (0, 0)$ and $(0, \\pi)$.\n\nTo determine their stability, we examine the second derivatives of the potential $V(\\theta)=K\\cos(\\theta)$.\n$V''(\\theta) = -K\\cos(\\theta)$.\nAt $\\theta=0$, $V''(0)=-K  0$, which is a potential maximum, so $(0,0)$ is an unstable fixed point (saddle).\nAt $\\theta=\\pi$, $V''(\\pi)=K > 0$, which is a potential minimum, so $(0,\\pi)$ is a stable fixed point (center of the island).\n\nThe separatrix is the trajectory with the same energy as the unstable fixed point. The energy on the separatrix is:\n$$\nE_{sep} = H_{eff}(0, 0) = \\frac{0^2}{2} + K \\cos(0) = K\n$$\nThe equation for the separatrix is $H_{eff}(p, \\theta) = E_{sep}$:\n$$\n\\frac{p^2}{2} + K \\cos(\\theta) = K\n$$\nSolving for $p$:\n$$\np^2 = 2K(1 - \\cos(\\theta)) = 2K(2 \\sin^2(\\frac{\\theta}{2})) = 4K \\sin^2(\\frac{\\theta}{2})\n$$\nThe momentum on the separatrix is $p(\\theta) = \\pm 2\\sqrt{K} |\\sin(\\frac{\\theta}{2})|$.\n\nThe width of the resonance island, $W_p$, is the maximum momentum extent of the separatrix. This occurs when $\\sin(\\theta/2)$ is maximum, i.e., $|\\sin(\\theta/2)|=1$, which happens at $\\theta=\\pi$.\nThe maximum momentum deviation is $p_{max} = 2\\sqrt{K}$.\nThe full width of the resonance island is the difference between the maximum and minimum momentum values on the separatrix, which is from $-p_{max}$ to $+p_{max}$.\n$$\nW_p = p_{max} - (-p_{max}) = 2 p_{max} = 4\\sqrt{K}\n$$\n\n**Step 4: Chirikov Overlap Criterion**\n\nThe Chirikov criterion estimates the onset of global chaos when adjacent resonance islands touch.
