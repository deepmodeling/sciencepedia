The body's propulsion system (e.g., a propeller) generates thrust that perfectly balances its drag, resulting in zero net force on the body, and consequently, zero net momentum flux added to the fluid.\n\nThe velocity profile in the wake is denoted by $u(x, r)$, where $x$ is the streamwise coordinate and $r$ is the radial distance from the axis of symmetry.
