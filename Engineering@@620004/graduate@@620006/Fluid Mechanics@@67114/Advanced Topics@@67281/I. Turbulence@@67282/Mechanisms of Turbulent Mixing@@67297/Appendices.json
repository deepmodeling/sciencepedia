This practice challenges you to think critically about the physical underpinnings of such models. By analyzing a turbulent flow in a circular pipe, you will use fundamental principles of symmetry and kinematics to explain why the mixing length must be zero at the centerline, ensuring the model is physically consistent [@problem_id:1812839].", "problem": "In the study of fluid mechanics, zero-equation turbulence models provide a simplified way to estimate the effects of turbulence without solving additional transport equations. One of the earliest and most famous is Prandtl's mixing length model. This model is used to approximate the turbulent shear stress, $\\tau_t$, in a flow. Consider a fully developed, incompressible, and axisymmetric turbulent flow moving through a long, straight, circular pipe of radius $R$.\n\nThe mixing length, $\\ell_m$, is physically interpreted as the average transverse distance a coherent fluid parcel (an \"eddy\") travels before it mixes with the surrounding fluid and loses its distinct momentum. For axisymmetric flow in a pipe, it is a fundamental requirement of the model that the mixing length $\\ell_m$ must be zero at the centerline of the pipe (i.e., at a radial position $r=0$).\n\nWhich of the following statements provides the most accurate and fundamental physical reason for this requirement?\n\nA. The no-slip condition at the pipe wall ($r=R$) dictates that the velocity is zero there, and this boundary condition forces the velocity gradient, and consequently the mixing length, to be zero at the centerline.\n\nB. Due to axisymmetry, there can be no net transport of momentum across the centerline. This implies that the transverse velocity fluctuations responsible for turbulent mixing must vanish at $r=0$, kinematically preventing eddies from crossing the centerline and thus forcing their characteristic travel distance (the mixing length) to be zero.\n\nC. The mean velocity profile has a maximum value at the centerline. Calculus dictates that any smooth function at a maximum must have a first derivative of zero, so the mean velocity gradient is zero at $r=0$, which in turn requires the mixing length to be zero.\n\nD. At the centerline of the pipe, viscous shear stresses reach their maximum value, overwhelming any turbulent effects. Since the mixing length model only describes turbulence, the mixing length must be set to zero where viscous effects are completely dominant.\n\nE. For an axisymmetric flow, the pressure is constant across any given radial cross-section. The absence of a radial pressure gradient means there is no force to drive the turbulent eddies across the centerline, so the mixing length must be zero.", "solution": "For fully developed, incompressible, axisymmetric turbulent flow in a circular pipe, the mean axial velocity is $U(r)$ and the relevant shear stress component is\n$$\n\\tau_{rz}(r)= -\\rho\\,\\overline{u'v_r'}+\\mu \\frac{dU}{dr}.\n$$\nIn fully developed pipe flow, the total shear stress varies linearly with $r$ and satisfies\n$$\n\\tau_{rz}(r)=-\\frac{r}{2}\\frac{dp}{dz},\n$$\nso $\\tau_{rz}(0)=0$. In Prandtl’s mixing-length model, the turbulent shear stress is closed as\n$$\n\\tau_{t} \\equiv -\\rho\\,\\overline{u'v_r'}=\\rho\\,\\ell_{m}^{2}\\left|\\frac{dU}{dr}\\right|\\frac{dU}{dr}.\n$$\nBecause the centerline is a point of symmetry, the mean velocity $U(r)$ attains a maximum there, so\n$$\n\\left.\\frac{dU}{dr}\\right|_{r=0}=0.\n$$\nThis immediately yields $\\tau_{t}(0)=0$ irrespective of the value of $\\ell_{m}(0)$. Therefore, the vanishing of the mean gradient at $r=0$ does not by itself require $\\ell_{m}(0)=0$, so invoking only $\\frac{dU}{dr}(0)=0$ (as in statement C) is not a sufficient or fundamental reason.\n\nTo determine the behavior of $\\ell_{m}$ at the axis, one must use the kinematics implied by axisymmetry and regularity of the velocity field at $r=0$. Let $(u,v_r)$ denote the axial and radial components of the instantaneous velocity fluctuations, with $v_r$ the transverse (radial) component. In cylindrical coordinates, the radial component is $v_r=v_x \\cos\\theta+v_y\\sin\\theta$, where $(v_x,v_y)$ are Cartesian components in a plane normal to the pipe axis and $\\theta$ is the polar angle. For a smooth, single-valued velocity field, the limit of $v_r$ as $r\\to 0$ must be independent of $\\theta$. The only way this can hold for arbitrary $\\theta$ is\n$$\nv_r(0)=0.\n$$\nHence, by symmetry and regularity, the instantaneous transverse (radial) velocity fluctuation vanishes exactly at the centerline, and therefore the turbulent transport across the centerline is kinematically prohibited at $r=0$. In particular,\n$$\n\\overline{u'v_r'}(0)=0,\n$$\nreflecting the absence of transverse transport through the axis.\n\nPrandtl’s mixing length $\\ell_{m}$ is the characteristic transverse distance an eddy (a coherent parcel) can travel before losing its identity and mixing. At $r=0$, because $v_r'=0$ exactly by the axisymmetry-induced kinematic constraint, an eddy cannot cross the centerline; its characteristic transverse travel distance there must therefore be zero:\n$$\n\\ell_{m}(0)=0.\n$$\nThis argument is the fundamental physical reason for the requirement. By contrast: (A) incorrectly attributes centerline behavior to the wall no-slip condition; (C) confuses $\\tau_{t}(0)=0$ due to $\\frac{dU}{dr}(0)=0$ with the independent requirement on $\\ell_{m}$; (D) is false because viscous shear is actually zero at the centerline; and (E) misattributes turbulent transport to a radial pressure force, which is not the mechanism of turbulent mixing.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate and fundamental reason is the axisymmetry-imposed kinematic constraint that forbids transverse fluctuations and transport at the axis, forcing $\\ell_{m}(0)=0$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1812839"}, {"introduction": "More sophisticated turbulence models seek to predict how effectively turbulence transports different quantities, such as momentum versus a passive scalar like temperature or a contaminant.
