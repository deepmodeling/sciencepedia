The state of the gas can be described by its pressure $p$, density $\\rho$, and velocity $u$. The local speed of sound is given by $c = \\sqrt{\\gamma p / \\rho}$. For one-dimensional isentropic flow, two Riemann invariants exist, which are constant along characteristic curves $dx/dt = u \\pm c$. For a simple wave (like a rarefaction wave) propagating to the right, the Riemann invariant $I_{-} = u - \\frac{2c}{\\gamma-1}$ is constant throughout the flow, while for a wave propagating to the left, $I_{+} = u + \\frac{2c}{\\gamma-1}$ is constant.

This new state, State 5, is created by the interaction of two initial states, State 2 and State 3. The key principle is that the pressure and velocity must be continuous across the contact surface that (in principle) separates the gas originating from region 2 and region 3. Since the final state is uniform, this means there is a single pressure $p_5$ and a single velocity $u_5$ in the region between the two rarefaction waves.\n\nWe can find the velocity $u_5$ by considering each rarefaction wave separately and then equating the results.\n\n**1. Left-Propagating Rarefaction Wave**\n\nA rarefaction wave propagates to the left from the interface at $x=0$ into State 2. This wave connects State 2 $(u_2, p_2, c_2)$ to State 5 $(u_5, p_5, c_5)$.

Matching and Solving for $p_5$**\n\nThe velocity $u_5$ in the intermediate region must be the same regardless of whether we approach it from State 2 or State 3. Therefore, we can equate the two expressions for $u_5$:\n$$u_2 + \\frac{2c_2}{\\gamma-1} \\left[1 - \\left(\\frac{p_5}{p_2}\\right)^{\\frac{\\gamma-1}{2\\gamma}}\\right] = u_3 - \\frac{2c_3}{\\gamma-1} \\left[1 - \\left(\\frac{p_5}{p_3}\\right)^{\\frac{\\gamma-1}{2\\gamma}}\\right]$$\nOur goal is to solve this equation for $p_5$. Let's collect terms involving $p_5$ on one side and all other terms on the other.
