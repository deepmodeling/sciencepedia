This geometry creates a decelerating flow region, which can lead to boundary layer separation.\n\nThe flow outside the boundary layer is irrotational and can be described by potential flow theory. For a flow into a corner of this type, the free-stream velocity along the wall is given by $U_e(x) = C x^m$, where $x$ is the distance from the corner at $x=0$, and $C$ is a constant. The exponent $m$ is determined by the turning angle $\\alpha$.\n\nTo analyze the boundary layer development, we use an approximate integral method based on Thwaites' correlation.
