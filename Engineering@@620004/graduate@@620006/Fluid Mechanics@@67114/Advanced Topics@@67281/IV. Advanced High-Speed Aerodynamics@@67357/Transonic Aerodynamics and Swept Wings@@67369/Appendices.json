This practice delves into the fundamental trade-off that aircraft designers face: reducing wave drag versus managing friction drag. By increasing the sweep angle $\\Lambda$, we reduce the component of the Mach number normal to the wing, delaying the formation of powerful shock waves and their associated drag. However, this simultaneously increases the wetted surface area, leading to higher skin friction. This exercise will guide you through a simplified but powerful model to find the optimal sweep angle that minimizes total drag, offering a clear, quantitative insight into a core principle of transonic aircraft design [@problem_id:666952].", "problem": "In transonic and supersonic flight, sweeping a wing's leading edge is a critical design feature used to manage compressibility effects, primarily by reducing the effective Mach number normal to the wing. This reduction delays the formation of strong shock waves and the associated wave drag. However, sweeping the wing increases its wetted area for a given span, which in turn increases the skin friction drag. This creates a trade-off: increasing the sweep angle reduces wave drag but increases friction drag.\n\nConsider a highly simplified model for the drag coefficient of a high-aspect-ratio wing flying at a freestream Mach number $M_\\infty > 1$. The total drag coefficient, $C_D$, is approximated as the sum of a wave drag component, $C_{D,w}$, and a skin friction drag component, $C_{D,f}$.\n\nThe wave drag coefficient is modeled based on the component of the Mach number normal to the leading edge, $M_n = M_\\infty \\cos\\Lambda$, where $\\Lambda$ is the sweep angle. The model is given by:\n$$\nC_{D,w} = K_w (M_{\\infty}^2 \\cos^2\\Lambda - 1)\n$$\nThis expression is valid for the supersonic normal flow regime where $M_\\infty \\cos\\Lambda > 1$. $K_w$ is a positive constant that depends on the airfoil's thickness and shape.\n\nThe skin friction drag is proportional to the wing's total wetted surface area. For a fixed span, sweeping the wing by an angle $\\Lambda$ increases the wetted area relative to an unswept wing ($S_{ref}$) by a factor of $1/\\cos\\Lambda$. Consequently, the friction drag coefficient, referenced to $S_{ref}$, is given by:\n$$\nC_{D,f} = \\frac{C_{f_0}}{\\cos\\Lambda}\n$$\nwhere $C_{f_0}$ is the constant skin friction coefficient for an equivalent unswept wing.\n\nAssuming the total drag is solely the sum of these two components, derive an expression for the optimal sweep angle, $\\Lambda_{opt}$, that minimizes the total drag coefficient, $C_D$.
