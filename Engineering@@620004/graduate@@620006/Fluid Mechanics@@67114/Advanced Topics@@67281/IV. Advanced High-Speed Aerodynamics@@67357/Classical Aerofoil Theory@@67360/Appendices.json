However, they famously fail to predict any drag, a contradiction known as d'Alembert's paradox. This practice challenges you to identify the core physical assumption responsible for this discrepancy, which is the first step toward appreciating both the power and the boundaries of classical aerofoil theory. [@problem_id:1801092]", "problem": "The Kutta-Joukowski theorem, a cornerstone of theoretical aerodynamics, successfully predicts the lift generated by an airfoil by relating it to the circulation of the flow around the body. The theorem is derived under the assumptions of an ideal fluid, which is incompressible, inviscid, and irrotational. A striking consequence of this ideal fluid model, often referred to as d'Alembert's paradox, is that it predicts zero aerodynamic drag on a body moving through the fluid at a constant velocity.\n\nWhich of the following statements provides the most fundamental physical reason for the failure of ideal fluid theory to predict drag on a lifting body?\n\nA. The theory neglects the formation of a bound vortex around the airfoil, which is the source of circulation and lift, but also contributes to drag.\n\nB. The theory assumes the flow is incompressible, which is an invalid assumption at high speeds where compressibility effects lead to wave drag.\n\nC. The theory ignores the effects of viscosity, which is responsible for both skin friction drag and the pressure difference between the fore and aft parts of the body (form drag).\n\nD. The theory assumes the flow is steady, failing to account for the unsteady shedding of vortices in the wake (induced drag), which is the primary source of drag for lifting bodies.\n\nE. The theory incorrectly applies Bernoulli's principle, which is only valid along a streamline and cannot be used to calculate forces integrated over the entire surface of the body.", "solution": "We start from the governing equations and stress representation to identify what ideal-fluid theory omits. In an ideal, incompressible, inviscid, irrotational flow, the velocity field satisfies $\\nabla \\cdot \\boldsymbol{u}=0$, $\\nabla \\times \\boldsymbol{u}=0$, and the Euler momentum equation\n$$\n\\rho\\left(\\frac{\\partial \\boldsymbol{u}}{\\partial t}+(\\boldsymbol{u}\\cdot \\nabla)\\boldsymbol{u}\\right)=-\\nabla p,\n$$\nwith the Cauchy stress tensor reducing to purely isotropic pressure,\n$$\n\\boldsymbol{T}=-p\\boldsymbol{I}.\n$$\nFor steady, irrotational flow, Bernoulli’s relation holds globally:\n$$\np+\\frac{1}{2}\\rho |\\boldsymbol{u}|^{2}=\\text{constant}.\n$$\nBecause the only surface traction is pressure acting normal to the surface, the net streamwise force (drag) on a closed body in a uniform flow, computed as\n$$\nD=\\int_{S} \\left(-p\\boldsymbol{n}\\right)\\cdot \\hat{\\boldsymbol{x}}\\, \\mathrm{d}S,\n$$\nvanishes when evaluated with the ideal flow solution by global momentum conservation (d’Alembert’s paradox). Thus, within the ideal model, steady two-dimensional lifting flows have zero drag despite possibly nonzero circulation (as used in the Kutta-Joukowski theorem).\n\nIn a real fluid, the Cauchy stress tensor is\n$$\n\\boldsymbol{T}=-p\\boldsymbol{I}+\\mu\\left(\\nabla \\boldsymbol{u}+(\\nabla \\boldsymbol{u})^{T}\\right),\n$$\nso finite viscosity $\\mu$ introduces tangential shear stresses at the wall and in boundary layers.

Moreover, finite viscosity is what enforces the Kutta condition at a sharp trailing edge, selecting a unique circulation state in practice; without viscosity, the trailing-edge flow is singular and the lift-producing circulation is not uniquely determined.\n\nBy contrast, compressibility (option B) affects wave drag at high speeds but is not the fundamental cause of the classical zero-drag prediction at low speeds. The presence of a bound vortex (option A) is already included in inviscid lifting theory and does not, by itself, produce drag in two-dimensional steady potential flow. Unsteadiness and vortex shedding (option D) are not the primary cause of the drag that ideal theory misses; induced drag for finite wings exists even in steady, inviscid models via the trailing vortex system, but the classical paradox concerns profile/form drag that requires viscosity. Misapplication of Bernoulli’s principle (option E) is not the fundamental reason; the paradox arises even when Bernoulli is used within its domain of validity for ideal flow.\n\nTherefore, the most fundamental physical reason ideal-fluid theory fails to predict drag is that it ignores viscosity, which produces both skin friction and pressure (form) drag.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1801092"}, {"introduction": "Having established the framework of ideal flow, we now apply it to predict the forces on a two-dimensional airfoil.
