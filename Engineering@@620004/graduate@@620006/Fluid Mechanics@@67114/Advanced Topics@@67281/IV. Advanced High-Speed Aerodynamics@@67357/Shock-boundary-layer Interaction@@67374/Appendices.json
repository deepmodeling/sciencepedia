This interaction can result in either a regular reflection (RR) or a Mach reflection (MR). The transition between these two patterns is a critical design consideration for high-speed vehicles.\n\nAn inviscid criterion for this transition is related to the maximum possible flow deflection angle, $\\theta_{\\text{max}}$, that can be produced by an oblique shock for a given upstream Mach number, $M_1$. The standard relationship between the flow deflection angle $\\theta$, the shock wave angle $\\beta$, the upstream Mach number $M$, and the ratio of specific heats $\\gamma$ is given by the $\\theta$-$\\beta$-$M$ relation. Finding the maximum of this relation, i.e., determining $\\theta_{\\text{max}}$, typically involves a lengthy differentiation.\n\nA more elegant, alternative approach uses a thermodynamic state property. A key insight reveals that for the specific shock wave angle $\\beta$ that produces the maximum deflection $\\theta_{\\text{max}}$, the velocity of the flow downstream of the shock, $V_2$, is precisely equal to the critical speed of sound, $a^*$, corresponding to the upstream stagnation conditions.\n\nThe critical speed of sound, $a^*$, is defined as the speed of sound at a location in the flow where the Mach number is exactly unity.
