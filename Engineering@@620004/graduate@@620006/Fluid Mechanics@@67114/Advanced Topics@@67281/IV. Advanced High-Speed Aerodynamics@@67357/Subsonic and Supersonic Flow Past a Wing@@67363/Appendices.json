T. Jones' slender-body theory. In this theory, the three-dimensional steady flow past a slender wing is related to a two-dimensional unsteady flow in cross-flow planes.\n\n**Theoretical Background:**\nConsider a thin, flat wing placed in a uniform incompressible flow of density $\\rho_\\infty$ and velocity $U_\\infty$. The wing is at a small angle of attack $\\alpha$. According to Jones' theory, the flow in a plane perpendicular to the freestream (a cross-flow plane) can be analyzed as a 2D flow created by the wing's cross-section. For a small angle of attack, the cross-section, with a local span of $b(x)$, effectively moves downwards with a velocity $W=U_\\infty\\alpha$.\n\nThe sectional lift (lift per unit span), $l(x)$, generated by the wing is related to the rate of change of the fluid's momentum in the cross-flow plane. The vertical impulse per unit length of the fluid is $I_z(x) = m_a(x) W$, where $m_a(x)$ is the added mass per unit length of the 2D cross-section. The sectional lift is given by the time rate of change of this impulse, where time is related to the downstream distance by $t=x/U_\\infty$. This gives the relation:\n$$l(x) = U_\\infty \\frac{dI_z(x)}{dx} = U_\\infty \\frac{d}{dx}[m_a(x) W]$$\nFor a 2D flat plate of width $b$, the added mass per unit length is given by:\n$$m_a = \\rho_\\infty \\pi \\left(\\frac{b}{2}\\right)^2$$\nFor a slender wing with sharp leading edges, it is assumed that no leading-edge suction is developed. In this case, the induced drag, $D_i$, is the component of the total lift force, $L$, in the freestream direction: $D_i = L \\alpha$.
