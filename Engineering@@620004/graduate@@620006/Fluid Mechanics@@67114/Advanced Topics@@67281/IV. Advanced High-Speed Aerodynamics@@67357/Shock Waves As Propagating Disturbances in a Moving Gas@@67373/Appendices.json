The absolute velocity is the velocity measured by a stationary observer, which is the sum of the fluid's velocity and the wave's velocity relative to the fluid.\n\nLet the region upstream of the shock be region 1 and the region downstream be region 2. The flow is in the positive direction. A wave traveling upstream has a velocity relative to the fluid that is directed opposite to the flow.\n\nFirst, we need to determine the properties of the flow in region 2, immediately downstream of the shock.

Describe the Wave Front in the Fluid Rest Frame**\n\nIn the fluid rest frame (S'), the gas is stationary. The disturbance originates at the origin of S' and propagates outwards as a cylindrical sound wave. The speed of propagation is the speed of sound, $a_0$. After a time $t$, the radius of the cylindrical wave front is $R(t) = a_0 t$. The equation of the wave front in the S' frame is a circle in the xy-plane:\n$$ x'^2 + y'^2 = (a_0 t)^2 $$\n\n**3.
