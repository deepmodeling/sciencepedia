This phenomenon, known as superelevation, is a direct macroscopic consequence of the centrifugal force acting on the moving fluid. This practice provides a tangible introduction to the forces at play by guiding you to derive the surface tilt from a balance between the centrifugal force and the hydrostatic pressure gradient, offering a clear link between the primary flow and its observable effects [@problem_id:598676].", "problem": "Consider an incompressible, Newtonian fluid of constant density $\\rho$ and dynamic viscosity $\\mu$ flowing steadily in a wide, partially-filled, and weakly-curved rectangular channel. The channel has a width $W$ and the flow has a mean depth $H$. The flow is driven by gravity, $\\mathbf{g}$, as the channel bed has a small constant downward slope of angle $\\alpha$ in the direction of flow. The channel is curved in the horizontal plane with a large constant radius of curvature $R$, where $R \\gg W$ and $R \\gg H$.\n\nWe use a cylindrical coordinate system $(r, \\theta, z)$, where $z$ is the vertical coordinate measured upwards from the channel bed, $r$ is the radial coordinate measured from the center of curvature, and $\\theta$ is the azimuthal angle. The channel centerline is at $r=R$. The main flow velocity is in the $\\theta$-direction.\n\nFor a straight channel ($R \\to \\infty$) and under the assumption of a wide channel ($W \\gg H$), the primary velocity profile $u_\\theta(z)$ is given by the well-known solution for gravity-driven flow down an inclined plane:\n$$u_\\theta(z) = \\frac{\\rho g \\sin\\alpha}{2\\mu} (2Hz - z^2)$$\nwhere $g$ is the magnitude of the gravitational acceleration. The free surface for the straight channel is flat at $z=H$.\n\nDue to the channel's curvature, a centrifugal force acts on the fluid, causing a transverse (radial) tilt of the free surface, a phenomenon known as superelevation. Let the new free surface height be $z=h(r)$.\n\nAssuming that the secondary flows in the $r-z$ plane are negligible and that the pressure distribution in the vertical direction remains hydrostatic, the radial pressure gradient is established to balance the centrifugal force. This physical model yields a relationship between the local free surface slope and the local primary velocity. To resolve the vertical dependency, we approximate the effective centrifugal force using the depth-averaged square of the velocity.\n\nUnder these assumptions, derive an expression for the total superelevation, $\\Delta h = h(R+W/2) - h(R-W/2)$, which is the difference in free surface height between the outer and inner walls of the channel.
