The no-slip boundary condition applies at the walls. For wedge half-angles $\\alpha$ below a critical value $\\alpha_c \\approx 73.1^\\circ$, the solution for the stream function near the corner vertex ($r=0$) is dominated by an eigenfunction corresponding to a complex eigenvalue $\\lambda = p+iq$.

The solution can be found by analyzing the scaling properties of the flow based on the given form of the stream function.\n\n**1. Geometric Scaling of Eddies**\n\nThe eddies are regions of closed streamlines nested within each other. The boundaries of these eddies (separatrices), as well as their centers, are determined by the oscillatory nature of the stream function $\\psi$. The oscillatory behavior comes from the term $r^{iq} = e^{iq \\ln r}$.\nLet's analyze the flow along the centerline $\\theta=0$. Due to symmetry, $f(\\theta)$ is a real-valued function on the centerline (or more generally, its phase is constant). Let $A f(0) = K e^{i\\phi_0}$, where $K$ and $\\phi_0$ are real constants.\nThe stream function on the centerline is:\n$$\n\\psi(r, 0) = \\operatorname{Re}\\left[ (K e^{i\\phi_0}) r^{p+iq} \\right] = \\operatorname{Re}\\left[ K r^{p} e^{i(q\\ln r + \\phi_0)} \\right] = K r^{p} \\cos(q\\ln r + \\phi_0)\n$$\nThe stagnation points on the centerline, which separate the eddies, are located at radial positions $r_n$ where $\\psi(r_n, 0) = 0$. This occurs when the cosine term is zero:\n$$\nq\\ln r_n + \\phi_0 = \\frac{\\pi}{2} + n\\pi\n$$\nfor integer $n$. We can order the stagnation points such that larger $n$ corresponds to smaller $r_n$ (closer to the vertex). Let's define the sequence for $n=1, 2, \\dots$.\n$$\n\\ln r_n = \\frac{1}{q} \\left( \\frac{\\pi}{2} - \\phi_0 - n\\pi \\right)\n$$\nThe relationship between the radial positions of two successive stagnation points is:\n$$\n\\ln r_{n+1} - \\ln r_n = \\frac{1}{q} (-\\pi) \\implies \\ln\\left(\\frac{r_{n+1}}{r_n}\\right) = -\\frac{\\pi}{q}\n$$\nThe ratio of the radial positions is therefore:\n$$\n\\frac{r_{n+1}}{r_n} = e^{-\\pi/q}\n$$\nSince the eddies are geometrically self-similar, any characteristic linear dimension $L_n$ (like the eddy \"diameter\" or the radial position of the eddy center) must scale in the same way. Thus, the geometric scaling ratio for successive eddies is:\n$$\n\\frac{L_{n+1}}{L_n} = e^{-\\pi/q}\n$$\n\n**2. Scaling of Circulation**\n\nThe circulation $\\Gamma_n$ is the integral of velocity around the separatrix $C_n$. Due to the self-similarity of the flow structure within each eddy, the circulation $\\Gamma_n$ must be proportional to the characteristic velocity $U_n$ and the characteristic length $L_n$ of the eddy: $\\Gamma_n \\propto U_n L_n$. A more direct approach uses the relation between circulation and the stream function.\n\nFor a 2D flow, all dimensionless quantities related to the flow pattern within an eddy are identical due to self-similarity. Let's non-dimensionalize the stream function for the $n$-th eddy by its maximum value within that eddy, $\\psi_{max,n}$, and its characteristic size, $L_n$. Let $\\mathbf{x}^* = \\mathbf{x}/L_n$ and $\\psi_n^*(\\mathbf{x}^*) = \\psi(\\mathbf{x})/\\psi_{max,n}$.\nThe velocity is $\\mathbf{u} = (\\frac{\\partial\\psi}{\\partial y}, -\\frac{\\partial\\psi}{\\partial x})$. A characteristic velocity is $U_n \\sim \\psi_{max,n}/L_n$.\nThe circulation is $\\Gamma_n = \\oint_{C_n} \\mathbf{u} \\cdot d\\mathbf{l}$.\nIn non-dimensional terms: $d\\mathbf{l} = L_n d\\mathbf{l}^*$, and $\\mathbf{u} = U_n \\mathbf{u}^* \\propto (\\psi_{max,n}/L_n) \\mathbf{u}^*$.\n$$\n\\Gamma_n \\propto \\left(\\frac{\\psi_{max,n}}{L_n}\\right) L_n \\oint_{C_n^*} \\mathbf{u}^* \\cdot d\\mathbf{l}^* = \\psi_{max,n} \\times (\\text{a dimensionless constant})\n$$\nSince the dimensionless integral is the same for all eddies due to self-similarity, we have a direct proportionality:\n$$\n\\Gamma_n \\propto \\psi_{max,n}\n$$\n\n**3. Scaling of the Maximum Stream Function**\n\nNow, we need to find how $\\psi_{max,n}$ scales with the eddy number $n$. The eddy center $(r_c, \\theta_c)$ is where $\\psi$ is maximum. The radial position of the center of the $n$-th eddy, $r_{c,n}$, must scale with its size $L_n$, so $r_{c,n} \\propto L_n$.\nThe magnitude of the stream function is given by the amplitude of the expression $\\psi = \\operatorname{Re}\\left[ A r^{\\lambda} f(\\theta) \\right]$. The dominant non-oscillatory radial dependence is $r^{p}$.\nSo, the maximum value of the stream function in the $n$-th eddy will scale as:\n$$\n\\psi_{max,n} \\propto (r_{c,n})^{p} \\propto L_n^{p}\n$$\n\n**4.
