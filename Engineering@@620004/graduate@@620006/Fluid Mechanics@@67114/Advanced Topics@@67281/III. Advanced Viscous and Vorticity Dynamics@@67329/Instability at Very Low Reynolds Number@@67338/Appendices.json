The entire system is subject to a uniform gravitational field $\\mathbf{g} = -g \\hat{\\mathbf{z}}$.\n\nTo counteract gravity and achieve levitation, a magnetic field is generated by a circular loop of wire of radius $R$. The loop is centered at the origin $(0,0,0)$ and lies in the $x-y$ plane. It carries a steady current $I$. The resulting magnetic field along the central axis of the loop (the $z$-axis) is given by:\n$$\n\\mathbf{H}(z) = H_z(z) \\hat{\\mathbf{z}} = \\frac{I R^2}{2(R^2+z^2)^{3/2}} \\hat{\\mathbf{z}}\n$$\nThe sphere is constrained to move only along the $z$-axis.
