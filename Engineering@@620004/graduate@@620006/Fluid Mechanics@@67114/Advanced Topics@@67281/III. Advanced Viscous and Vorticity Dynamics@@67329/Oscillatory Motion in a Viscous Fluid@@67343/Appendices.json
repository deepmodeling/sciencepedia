Shear Stress on an Oscillating Flat Plate**\n\nFirst, we solve for the shear stress on an infinite flat plate oscillating tangentially in a viscous fluid. Let the plate be at $y=0$ and the fluid occupy the half-space $y>0$. The plate's velocity is $V(t) = V_0 e^{-i\\omega t}$. The flow is governed by the 1D unsteady Stokes equation:\n$$\n\\rho \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t} = \\mu \\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial y^2}\n$$\nWe seek a solution of the form $u(y,t) = \\tilde{u}(y)e^{-i\\omega t}$. Substituting this into the equation gives:\n$$\n-i\\omega\\rho \\tilde{u} = \\mu \\frac{d^2 \\tilde{u}}{dy^2} \\implies \\frac{d^2 \\tilde{u}}{dy^2} - k^2 \\tilde{u} = 0\n$$\nwhere $k^2 = \\frac{-i\\omega\\rho}{\\mu}$. The boundary conditions are $u(0,t) = V_0 e^{-i\\omega t}$ (no-slip) and $u(\\infty, t) = 0$ (fluid at rest far away). In terms of $\\tilde{u}(y)$, these are $\\tilde{u}(0) = V_0$ and $\\tilde{u}(\\infty)=0$.\n\nThe general solution is $\\tilde{u}(y) = A e^{ky} + B e^{-ky}$. The condition at infinity requires $A=0$ (since $\\Re(k) > 0$). The condition at the plate surface gives $B=V_0$. Thus, the complex velocity profile is:\n$$\nu(y,t) = V_0 e^{-ky} e^{-i\\omega t}\n$$\nThe complex constant $k$ is given by:\n$$\nk = \\sqrt{\\frac{-i\\omega\\rho}{\\mu}} = \\sqrt{e^{-i\\pi/2}} \\sqrt{\\frac{\\omega\\rho}{\\mu}} = e^{-i\\pi/4} \\sqrt{\\frac{\\omega\\rho}{\\mu}} = (\\cos(-\\pi/4)+i\\sin(-\\pi/4))\\sqrt{\\frac{\\omega\\rho}{\\mu}} = \\frac{1-i}{\\sqrt{2}}\\sqrt{\\frac{\\omega\\rho}{\\mu}} = \\frac{1-i}{\\delta}\n$$\nwhere $\\delta = \\sqrt{2\\mu/(\\omega\\rho)}$ is the viscous penetration depth.\n\nThe shear stress on the plate is $\\tau(t) = \\mu \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial y}\\big|_{y=0}$.\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial y} = -k V_0 e^{-ky} e^{-i\\omega t} \\implies \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial y}\\bigg|_{y=0} = -k V_0 e^{-i\\omega t}\n$$\nSo, the complex amplitude of the shear stress is $\\tilde{\\tau} = \\mu k V_0$. Note: this is stress exerted *by the fluid on the plate*. A positive stress in the direction of $V_0$. Let's re-examine $k$. With $U(t) = U_0 e^{-i\\omega t}$, the momentum equation is $-i\\omega \\rho \\tilde{u} = \\mu d^2\\tilde{u}/dy^2$, so $d^2\\tilde{u}/dy^2 = (-i\\omega\\rho/\\mu)\\tilde{u}$. Let's use the other convention $k^2 = i\\omega\\rho/\\mu$. Then $k=\\frac{1+i}{\\delta}$. $d^2\\tilde{u}/dy^2 + k^2 \\tilde{u} = 0$. Solution is $\\tilde{u}(y) = V_0 e^{iky}$. Shear stress $\\tilde{\\tau} = \\mu(ik V_0)$. This gives a different sign. Let's stick to the original derivation in the problem.\nWait, the original solution had $k^2 = i\\omega\\rho/\\mu$, which leads to $k = (1+i)/\\delta$. The stress was $\\tilde{\\tau} = -\\mu k V_0$.
