The swimmer consists of three identical slender links, each of length $L$, connected by two hinges. Its motion is governed by the principles of resistive force theory (RFT), where the force exerted by the fluid on an element of a link depends on its velocity relative to the fluid. The drag coefficients for motion parallel and perpendicular to the link are $\\xi_\\parallel$ and $\\xi_\\perp$, respectively. Their ratio is denoted by $\\gamma = \\xi_\\perp / \\xi_\\parallel > 1$.\n\nThe conformation of the swimmer is described by the two angles, $\\phi_1(t)$ and $\\phi_2(t)$, that the two outer links make with the central link.
