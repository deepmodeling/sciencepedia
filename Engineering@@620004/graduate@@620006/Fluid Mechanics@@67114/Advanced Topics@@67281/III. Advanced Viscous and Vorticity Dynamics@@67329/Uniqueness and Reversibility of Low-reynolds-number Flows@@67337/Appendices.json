This requires $C_x = 0$ and $C_y = 0$. This implies that the pressure gradients $\\partial p / \\partial x$ and $\\partial p / \\partial y$ are zero, so the pressure $p$ must be constant.\n\nWith $C_x=0$ and $C_y=0$, the vorticity becomes:\n$$\n\\boldsymbol{\\omega} = (-A_y, A_x, 0)\n$$\nWe equate this to the specified vorticity $\\boldsymbol{\\omega} = (0, \\omega_0, 0)$:\n$$\n-A_y = 0 \\implies A_y = 0\n$$\n$$\nA_x = \\omega_0\n$$\nSubstituting these constants back into the velocity expression, we find the specific solution $\\mathbf{u}_2$:\n$$\n\\mathbf{u}_2(z) = (U + \\omega_0 z, V, 0)\n$$\n\n**3.
