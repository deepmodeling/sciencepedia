Whether they manage to travel upstream or are swept away is not a matter of chance, but a fundamental concept in fluid dynamics. This practice explores the competition between the wave's own propagation speed and the velocity of the fluid it travels in. By analyzing this accessible scenario, you will gain hands-on experience with the critical condition that governs whether a disturbance can move against a current, a principle essential in fields from hydraulic engineering to naval architecture [@problem_id:1758881].", "problem": "A landscape architecture firm is designing a long, straight, decorative water channel for a park. A key aesthetic goal is for the water to appear tranquil, meaning that any small surface disturbance, such as a fallen leaf, should create ripples that visibly propagate both upstream and downstream. According to the design specifications, the channel will have a uniform water depth of $h = 0.20$ m, and the water will flow at a constant velocity of $V = 1.50$ m/s.\n\nAssume the ripples behave as shallow-water waves and take the acceleration due to gravity to be $g = 9.81$ m/s$^2$. Based on these parameters, will the design meet the aesthetic requirement that ripples can travel upstream?\n\nA. Yes, because the wave propagation speed is greater than the flow velocity.\n\nB.
