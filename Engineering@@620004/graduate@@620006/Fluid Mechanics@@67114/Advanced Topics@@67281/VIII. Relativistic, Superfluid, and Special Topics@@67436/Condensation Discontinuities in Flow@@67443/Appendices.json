The characteristic length of this exponential relaxation is $L_{relax} = -1/\\lambda$.\n$$L_{relax} = -\\frac{u_2 \\tau_c}{C_\\sigma}$$\nSince $M_2 < 1$, $M_2^2-1$ is negative. The assumption of monotonic relaxation implies that $C_\\sigma$ is negative, ensuring $L_{relax}$ is positive.\n\n**Step 4: Substitute and simplify the expression for $L_{relax}$.**\n\n$$L_{relax} = -u_2 \\tau_c \\left( \\frac{c_p T_2(M_2^2-1)}{L \\left[ \\gamma M_2^2 - \\frac{L}{R_v T_2} (\\gamma M_2^2 - 1) \\right]} \\right)$$\n$$L_{relax} = u_2 \\tau_c \\frac{c_p T_2(1-M_2^2)}{L \\left[ \\gamma M_2^2 - \\frac{L}{R_v T_2} (\\gamma M_2^2 - 1) \\right]}$$\nThe problem asks for the answer in terms of $\\theta = L/(c_p T_2)$ and other parameters. We can also write $L/(R_v T_2) = (L/c_pT_2) \\cdot (c_p/R_v) = \\theta \\frac{\\gamma}{\\gamma-1}$.\nSubstituting these into the expression:\n$$L_{relax} = u_2 \\tau_c \\frac{(L/\\theta)(1-M_2^2)}{L \\left[ \\gamma M_2^2 - \\theta \\frac{\\gamma}{\\gamma-1}(\\gamma M_2^2 - 1) \\right]}$$\n$$L_{relax} = u_2 \\tau_c \\frac{1-M_2^2}{\\theta \\left[ \\gamma M_2^2 - \\theta \\frac{\\gamma}{\\gamma-1}(\\gamma M_2^2 - 1) \\right]}$$\nNow, we simplify the denominator term:\n$$D = \\theta \\left[ \\frac{\\gamma M_2^2 (\\gamma-1) - \\gamma\\theta(\\gamma M_2^2 - 1)}{\\gamma-1} \\right] = \\frac{\\gamma\\theta}{\\gamma-1} \\left[ M_2^2(\\gamma-1) - \\theta(\\gamma M_2^2-1) \\right]$$\n$$D = \\frac{\\gamma\\theta}{\\gamma-1} \\left[ \\gamma M_2^2 - M_2^2 - \\gamma\\theta M_2^2 + \\theta \\right] = \\frac{\\gamma\\theta}{\\gamma-1} \\left[ \\theta + M_2^2(\\gamma-1-\\gamma\\theta) \\right]$$\nSubstituting this back into the expression for $L_{relax}$:\n$$L_{relax} = u_2 \\tau_c \\frac{1-M_2^2}{\\frac{\\gamma\\theta}{\\gamma-1} \\left[ \\theta + M_2^2(\\gamma-1-\\gamma\\theta) \\right]} = u_2 \\tau_c \\frac{(1-M_2^2)(\\gamma-1)}{\\gamma\\theta \\left( \\theta + M_2^2(\\gamma - 1 - \\gamma\\theta) \\right)}$$\nThis is the final expression for the relaxation length.", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{u_2 \\tau_c \\frac{(1-M_2^2)(\\gamma-1)}{\\gamma\\theta \\left( \\theta + M_2^2(\\gamma - 1 - \\gamma\\theta) \\right)}} $$", "id": "470828"}]}
