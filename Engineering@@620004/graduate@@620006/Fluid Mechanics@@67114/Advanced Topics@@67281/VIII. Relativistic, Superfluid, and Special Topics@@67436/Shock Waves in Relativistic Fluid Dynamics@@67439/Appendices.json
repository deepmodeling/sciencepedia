The physical laws of conservation of particle number and energy-momentum impose specific relations, known as the Rankine-Hugoniot conditions, on the fluid properties across this surface.\n\nConsider a perfect fluid in a spacetime with the Minkowski metric $g_{\\mu\\nu} = \\text{diag}(-1, 1, 1, 1)$, using units where the speed of light $c=1$. The fluid is characterized by its pressure $p$, total energy density $\\rho$, proper number density $n$, and four-velocity $u^\\mu$. The four-velocity is normalized as $u_\\mu u^\\mu = -1$. The energy-momentum tensor is given by $T^{\\mu\\nu} = (\\rho+p)u^\\mu u^\\nu + p g^{\\mu\\nu}$, and the particle number current is $N^\\mu = n u^\\mu$. For convenience, we use the specific enthalpy $w = (\\rho+p)/n$.\n\nLet's analyze a plane shock front that is at rest. The fluid flows along the x-direction, normal to the shock front. Upstream (region 1, pre-shock) quantities are denoted with a subscript 1, and downstream (region 2, post-shock) quantities with a subscript 2. The Rankine-Hugoniot conditions for this configuration are given by the conservation of particle flux, energy flux, and momentum flux across the shock:\n1.  $[n u^x] = 0$\n2.  $[w u^0] = 0$\n3.  $[(\\rho+p)(u^x)^2 + p] = 0$\n\nHere, the jump notation $[Q]$ denotes the change $Q_2 - Q_1$.\n\nA weak shock is characterized by a very small change in the fluid properties across the front. Specifically, the pressure jump $[p]$ is infinitesimal compared to the upstream pressure $p_1$. For such a weak shock, the discontinuous jump can be approximated by a continuous, isentropic process. This leads to a key thermodynamic relation between the jump in specific enthalpy and the jump in pressure, valid to first order:\n$$\n[w] \\approx \\frac{1}{n_1} [p]\n$$\n\nIn the weak shock limit, the jumps in all quantities are small, allowing the Rankine-Hugoniot conditions to be linearized. This linearization reveals a linear relationship between the pressure jump $[p]$ and the jump in the normal component of the four-velocity $[u^x]$, of the form:\n$$\n[p] = -Z [u^x]\n$$\n\nYour task is to derive the expression for the \"relativistic acoustic impedance\", $Z$. Your final answer should be expressed in terms of the upstream (pre-shock) fluid properties: the number density $n_1$, specific enthalpy $w_1$, and the components of the four-velocity $u^x_1$ and $u^0_1$.", "solution": "The goal is to find the relativistic acoustic impedance $Z$ in the weak shock limit relation $[p] = -Z[u^x]$. We start from the given Rankine-Hugoniot jump conditions and the thermodynamic relation for a weak shock.\n\nFirst, let's rewrite the momentum flux conservation condition (3) using the specific enthalpy $w = (\\rho+p)/n$ and the conserved particle flux $J = n u^x$.\nFrom condition (1), we have $n_1 u^x_1 = n_2 u^x_2 = J$, where $J$ is a constant across the shock.\nThe term $(\\rho+p)(u^x)^2$ in condition (3) can be written as $(wn)(u^x)^2 = w (n u^x) u^x = J w u^x$.\nSubstituting this into condition (3) gives:\n$$\n[J w u^x + p] = 0\n$$\n\nNow, we linearize this equation for a weak shock. Since $J$ is a constant, it can be taken out of the jump operator:\n$$\nJ [w u^x] + [p] = 0\n$$\nExpanding the term $[w u^x] = w_2 u^x_2 - w_1 u^x_1$:\nLet $w_2 = w_1 + [w]$ and $u^x_2 = u^x_1 + [u^x]$.\n$$\n[w u^x] = (w_1 + [w])(u^x_1 + [u^x]) - w_1 u^x_1 = w_1 [u^x] + u^x_1 [w] + [w][u^x]\n$$\nIn the weak shock limit, the jumps $[w]$ and $[u^x]$ are small, so their product $[w][u^x]$ is a second-order term and can be neglected. The linearized jump is:\n$$\n[w u^x] \\approx w_1 [u^x] + u^x_1 [w]\n$$\nSubstituting this back into the linearized momentum conservation equation:\n$$\nJ(w_1 [u^x] + u^x_1 [w]) + [p] = 0\n$$\n\nNow we use the provided thermodynamic relation for a weak (isentropic) shock:\n$$\n[w] \\approx \\frac{1}{n_1}[p]\n$$\nSubstitute this expression for $[w]$ into the linearized momentum equation:\n$$\nJ\\left(w_1 [u^x] + u^x_1 \\frac{1}{n_1}[p]\\right) + [p] = 0\n$$\nLet's expand and rearrange to solve for $[p]$.\n$$\nJ w_1 [u^x] + \\frac{J u^x_1}{n_1}[p] + [p] = 0\n$$\nWe know that the constant particle flux is defined by the upstream state, $J = n_1 u^x_1$.

This holds for any point in the fluid, so for the upstream state:\n$$\n(u^0_1)^2 = 1 + (u^x_1)^2\n$$\nSubstituting this into the denominator of our expression for $[p]$:\n$$\n[p] = - \\frac{n_1 u^x_1 w_1}{(u^0_1)^2} [u^x]\n$$\nBy comparing this result to the requested form $[p] = -Z [u^x]$, we can identify the relativistic acoustic impedance $Z$.\n\n$$\nZ = \\frac{n_1 u^x_1 w_1}{(u^0_1)^2}\n$$\nThis expression for $Z$ depends only on the upstream state variables, as required.

By applying symmetry arguments and the full non-linear shock jump conditions, you will calculate the resulting compression in the shocked material, providing a quantitative understanding of matter under extreme conditions.", "problem": "Consider the head-on collision of two identical, planar streams of a relativistic perfect fluid. The fluid is a photon gas, described by the equation of state $p = e/3$, where $p$ is the pressure and $e$ is the energy density in the fluid's rest frame. The speed of light is set to $c=1$.\n\nIn the laboratory reference frame, before the collision, one stream occupies the region $x<0$ and moves with a three-velocity $\\mathbf{v}_1 = (v, 0, 0)$, while the second stream occupies $x>0$ and moves with $\\mathbf{v}_2 = (-v, 0, 0)$. Both streams initially have the same energy density $e_i$.\n\nThe collision occurs at the plane $x=0$ for time $t \\ge 0$. By symmetry, the fluid in the central region created by the collision is at rest in the laboratory frame, i.e., its three-velocity is zero.

Let the energy density in this shocked central region be $e_f$.\n\nFor a relativistic normal shock in a photon gas, the squares of the proper four-velocities of the fluid relative to the shock front, for the upstream ($u_{up}^2$) and downstream ($u_{down}^2$) flows, are related by the expression:\n$$\nu_{down}^2 = \\frac{u_{up}^2+1}{8u_{up}^2-1}\n$$\nHere, the proper four-velocity magnitude $u$ is related to the relative three-velocity magnitude $v_{rel}$ by $u^2 = v_{rel}^2 / (1-v_{rel}^2)$. A physical shock requires the upstream flow to be supersonic with respect to the shock, which for a photon gas means $u_{up}^2 > 1/3$.\n\nGiven that the initial velocity of the streams is $v=1/2$, derive the final energy density compression ratio, $X_e = e_f/e_i$.", "solution": "1.  **Frame and Velocities**: We work in the lab frame. By symmetry, the shocked fluid in the central region is at rest, $v_f=0$. The unshocked fluid streams move inwards at speed $v$. Two symmetric shocks propagate outwards from the collision plane $x=0$ at speed $v_s$. We analyze the right-moving shock, which propagates into the fluid moving at velocity $-v$.\n\n2.  **Relative Velocities**: To use the given shock condition, we need the fluid velocities relative to the shock front. We use the relativistic velocity subtraction formula $v_{rel} = (v_A - v_B)/(1 - v_A v_B)$.\n    *   The upstream fluid (unshocked) has lab velocity $-v$. The shock has lab velocity $v_s$. The upstream fluid's speed relative to the shock is:\n        $$v_{up} = \\frac{v_s - (-v)}{1 - v_s(-v)} = \\frac{v+v_s}{1+vv_s}$$\n    *   The downstream fluid (shocked) is at rest in the lab, $v_f=0$.
