The total density is $\\rho = \\rho_n + \\rho_s$. The unique properties of He II allow for the propagation of two distinct sound modes in the bulk fluid:\n\n1.  **First sound:** A pressure-density wave, similar to sound in ordinary fluids, where the normal and superfluid components oscillate in phase. It propagates with a speed denoted by $c_1$.\n2.  **Second sound:** A temperature-entropy wave, a phenomenon unique to superfluids, where the two components oscillate out of phase such that the net mass flux is minimized. It propagates with a speed denoted by $c_2$.\n\nA localized, oscillating heat source immersed in He II primarily generates second sound. When a sound wave encounters a boundary, such as a solid wall, it can be partially reflected as a wave of the same mode and partially converted and reflected as a wave of the other mode. This process is known as mode conversion. For a linear interaction with a stationary boundary, the frequency of the wave is conserved throughout the reflection and mode conversion process.\n\n**Problem:**\nA point-like heat source, which oscillates with a constant intrinsic frequency $f_0$, moves with a constant velocity $\\mathbf{v}_s$ through stationary bulk He II. The source travels directly towards a large, stationary, flat wall that is impermeable to both fluid components and is a poor thermal conductor (effectively insulating). The magnitude of the source's velocity, $v_s$, is less than the speed of second sound ($v_s  c_2$).\n\nThe moving heat source generates a second sound wave that propagates towards the wall. Upon striking the wall, a portion of this incident second sound is mode-converted into a first sound wave, which then propagates away from the wall into the bulk He II.\n\nA stationary observer, equipped with a pressure-sensitive transducer, is located in the fluid at a position far from the trajectory of the heat source. This observer measures the frequency of the reflected first sound wave.\n\nDerive a symbolic expression for the frequency, $f_{obs}$, of the first sound detected by the stationary observer.

The second sound wave is emitted by a source moving at speed $v_s$ towards a stationary point (the wall) in a medium where the wave speed is $c_2$.

At the stationary wall, the incident second sound is partially converted into a reflected first sound wave. In this linear interaction, frequency is conserved. Therefore, the frequency of the generated first sound wave at the wall, $f_{\\mathrm{ref}}$, is equal to the frequency of the incident wave:\n    $$f_{\\mathrm{ref}} = f_{\\mathrm{inc}}$$\n\n3.  This reflected first sound wave propagates from the stationary wall to the stationary observer. Since both the source (the wall) and the observer are stationary relative to the medium for this part of the process, there is no further Doppler shift. The observed frequency $f_{\\mathrm{obs}}$ is therefore equal to the frequency of the reflected wave.\n    $$f_{\\mathrm{obs}} = f_{\\mathrm{ref}} = \\frac{f_0}{1 - \\frac{v_s}{c_2}}$$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{f_0}{1 - \\frac{v_s}{c_2}}}$$", "id": "604030"}, {"introduction": "In a stationary fluid, sound typically propagates at the same speed in all directions.

In a stationary superfluid, second sound propagates isotropically with velocity $c_{20}$. However, in the presence of a heat counterflow, this velocity becomes anisotropic.
