By synthesizing the principles of hydrostatic and thermomechanical equilibrium, you will derive the temperature gradient required to maintain a static fluid, revealing a profound and non-intuitive connection between quantum phenomena and gravity [@problem_id:658953].", "problem": "In the study of superfluids, Helium II (the phase of Helium-4 below approximately 2.17 K) is described by the two-fluid model. This model conceptualizes He II as a mixture of two interpenetrating fluids: a normal fluid component, which behaves like a classical viscous fluid and carries the entirety of the liquid's entropy and thermal excitations, and a superfluid component, which has zero viscosity and zero entropy.\n\nA remarkable consequence of this two-fluid nature is the thermomechanical effect (or fountain effect). This effect dictates that in a state of zero net mass flow, a temperature gradient $\\nabla T$ must be accompanied by a pressure gradient $\\nabla P$ to prevent internal counterflow of the two components. The relationship is given by the London equation:\n$$ \\nabla P = \\rho s \\nabla T $$\nwhere $\\rho$ is the total density of the liquid and $s$ is the specific entropy (entropy per unit mass).\n\nConsider a tall, thermally isolated vertical column of He II that has reached a state of complete thermodynamic and mechanical equilibrium within a uniform gravitational field of acceleration $g$. In this state, there are no macroscopic flows of either the normal or superfluid components. As with any static fluid, the column must be in hydrostatic equilibrium, where the pressure at any point supports the weight of the fluid above it.\n\nUsing the provided London equation for the thermomechanical effect, and the principle of hydrostatic equilibrium, derive an expression for the vertical temperature gradient, $\\frac{dT}{dz}$, within the stationary column of He II. The vertical coordinate $z$ is defined as positive in the upward direction, opposite to the direction of gravity.", "solution": "The problem asks for the equilibrium vertical temperature gradient in a stationary column of He II under gravity. We are given two fundamental physical principles that must hold simultaneously in this equilibrium state.\n\n**1. Hydrostatic Equilibrium:**\nFor any stationary fluid of density $\\rho$ in a gravitational field with acceleration $g$, the pressure gradient must balance the force of gravity. Consider a small cylindrical fluid element of height $dz$ and area $A$. The gravitational force on this element is $dF_g = -(\\rho A dz) g$, where the negative sign indicates the force is in the $-z$ direction. The net pressure force on the element is $dF_P = (P(z) - P(z+dz))A \\approx -(\\frac{dP}{dz}dz)A$.\nFor mechanical equilibrium, these forces must balance: $dF_P + dF_g = 0$.\n$$ - \\frac{dP}{dz} A dz - \\rho A dz\\, g = 0 $$\nDividing by the volume $A dz$, we get the condition for hydrostatic equilibrium:\n$$ \\frac{dP}{dz} = -\\rho g $$\n\n**2. Thermomechanical Equilibrium (Fountain Effect):**\nThe problem states that for a He II system with zero net mass flow, the pressure gradient is related to the temperature gradient by the London equation. In our one-dimensional vertical column, this equation becomes:\n$$ \\frac{dP}{dz} = \\rho s \\frac{dT}{dz} $$\nHere, $s$ is the specific entropy of the He II. This condition is necessary to ensure the absence of internal counterflow between the normal and superfluid components, which would otherwise be driven by the temperature gradient.\n\n**3. Combining the Conditions for Total Equilibrium:**\nFor the column of He II to be in complete equilibrium as described, both the hydrostatic and thermomechanical conditions must be satisfied at every point within the fluid. Therefore, we can equate the two expressions for the pressure gradient $\\frac{dP}{dz}$:\n$$ \\rho s \\frac{dT}{dz} = -\\rho g $$\n\n**4. Solving for the Temperature Gradient:**\nWe can now solve for the required temperature gradient $\\frac{dT}{dz}$. Assuming the density $\\rho$ is non-zero (which it must be for a fluid) and the specific entropy $s$ is non-zero (which is true for He II at any temperature $T > 0$), we can divide both sides by $\\rho s$:\n$$ \\frac{dT}{dz} = \\frac{-\\rho g}{\\rho s} $$\n$$ \\frac{dT}{dz} = -\\frac{g}{s} $$\n\nThis is the final expression for the vertical temperature gradient. The negative sign indicates that the temperature decreases with increasing height; the bottom of the column is warmer than the top.
