The term with coefficient $\\alpha$ represents bending stiffness (dispersion), and the term with coefficient $\\beta$ represents a form of nonlinear stiffness.\n\nThis equation admits solitary wave solutions. A solitary wave is a localized disturbance that propagates at a constant speed without changing its shape.
