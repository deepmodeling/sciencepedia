The system is subject to a constant gravitational acceleration $g$ acting vertically downwards.\n\nWe model this system using a 2D Cartesian coordinate system $(x, z)$, where the $x$-axis is horizontal and the $z$-axis points vertically upwards. The solid plate is located at $z=0$. The liquid film occupies the region $-h(x,t) < z < 0$. The unperturbed state corresponds to a flat interface at $z = -h_0$. We are interested in the stability of this film to small, varicose (thickness-mode) perturbations of the form $\\eta(x,t) = h(x,t) - h_0$.\n\nThe flow within the film is assumed to be slow and viscous, such that the lubrication approximation is valid.

The condition is given by $u = -L_s \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial z}$ at $z=0$, where $L_s$ is the slip length, a positive constant.\n3.  The pressure jump at the liquid-gas interface is governed by the Young-Laplace equation, which for small interface slopes simplifies to $p(z=-h) - P_{gas} = \\sigma \\kappa$, where $\\kappa \\approx \\frac{\\partial^2 (-h)}{\\partial x^2}$ is the curvature of the interface.

Perturbation Pressure**\nThe perturbation pressure $p'$ is driven by two effects: the effective gravity due to acceleration and the surface tension at the deformed interface.\nIn the accelerating frame, there is a fictitious force per unit volume directed radially outward, creating an effective gravity $\\mathbf{g}_{\\text{eff}} = a\\hat{r}$. This leads to a hydrostatic pressure perturbation.\nThe normal stress balance at the free surface $r = R_0 + \\zeta$ is $p' = p'_{\\text{accel}} + p'_{\\text{cap}}$.\na) **Acceleration (effective gravity):** The effective gravity points from the heavier fluid (liquid) to the lighter fluid (gas), leading to Rayleigh-Taylor instability. The pressure perturbation at the interface due to a displacement $\\zeta$ is $p'_{\\text{accel}} = -\\rho a \\zeta$. The negative sign indicates that an outward bulge ($\\zeta>0$) corresponds to a lower pressure region, which drives flow towards the bulge, hence instability.\nb) **Surface Tension (capillarity):** The pressure jump across the interface is $\\sigma \\kappa$.

We look for normal mode solutions of the form $\\zeta(\\theta, \\phi, t) = \\hat{\\zeta} Y_l^m(\\theta, \\phi) e^{\\omega t}$. For such a solution, $\\frac{\\partial \\zeta}{\\partial t} = \\omega \\zeta$, and the Laplace-Beltrami operator acts as $\\nabla_S^2 \\zeta = -\\frac{l(l+1)}{R_0^2} \\zeta$.
