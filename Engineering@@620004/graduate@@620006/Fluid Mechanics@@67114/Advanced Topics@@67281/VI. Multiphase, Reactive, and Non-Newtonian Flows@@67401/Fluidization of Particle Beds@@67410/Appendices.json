The particles are slender, rigid cylindrical rods of diameter $D$ and length $H$, with an aspect ratio $H/D \\gg 1$. The fluid has density $\\rho_f$ and dynamic viscosity $\\mu$, while the rods have density $\\rho_p$.\n\nThe state of minimum fluidization is achieved when the pressure drop across the bed, $\\Delta P$, is sufficient to support the weight of the particles. This is described by the relation:\n$$ \\frac{\\Delta P}{L_{mf}} = (1-\\epsilon_{mf})(\\rho_p - \\rho_f)g $$\nwhere $L_{mf}$ is the height of the bed, $\\epsilon_{mf}$ is the void fraction of the bed at a minimum fluidization condition, and $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity.\n\nFor flows where viscous forces dominate (low particle Reynolds number), the pressure gradient can be modeled by the Carman-Kozeny equation:\n$$ \\frac{\\Delta P}{L} = K \\frac{\\mu U (1-\\epsilon)^2 S_p^2}{\\epsilon^3} $$\nHere, $U$ is the superficial fluid velocity, $\\epsilon$ is the bed void fraction, $S_p$ is the specific surface area of the particles (total surface area per unit particle volume), and $K$ is the Carman-Kozeny constant, which depends on the arrangement of particles in the bed.\n\nThe engineer considers two distinct configurations for the bed of rods:\n1.  **Randomly Oriented Bed:** The rods are packed with no preferential orientation. In this configuration, the bed voidage at minimum fluidization is $\\epsilon_r$, and the Carman-Kozeny constant is $K_r$.\n2.  **Perfectly Aligned Bed:** The rods are perfectly aligned with their axes parallel to the direction of fluid flow. This ordered arrangement results in a different bed voidage at a minimum fluidization, $\\epsilon_a$. The parallel, non-tortuous flow paths reduce the viscous resistance. As a result, the Carman-Kozeny constant is exactly half that of the random case, i.e., $K_a = K_r/2$.\n\nAssuming the Carman-Kozeny model is valid for both configurations, derive an expression for the ratio of the minimum fluidization velocity in the aligned case to that in the random case, $\\frac{U_{mf,a}}{U_{mf,r}}$.

This exercise explores the process of bed collapse, or sedimentation, which occurs when the fluid flow is abruptly stopped.

Initially, the bed is in a steady state, uniformly expanded to a height $H_0$ with a constant voidage (volume fraction of fluid) of $\\epsilon_0$. At time $t=0$, the fluid flow is abruptly stopped, and the particles begin to settle under gravity in a process known as batch sedimentation.\n\nThe settling process is governed by Kynch's theory, which posits that the settling velocity of particles, $U_s$, is solely a function of the local particle concentration. For a particulately settling suspension (often termed Type 1 settling), a sharp interface forms between the top of the suspension and the clear fluid above it. This interface descends with a constant velocity equal to the settling velocity of particles within the initial uniform suspension, $U_s(\\epsilon_0)$.\n\nAs the particles settle, they form a final packed sediment layer at the bottom of the container, characterized by a minimum voidage of $\\epsilon_f$.

The theory posits that a fluidized bed operating with a superficial gas velocity $U$ greater than the minimum fluidization velocity $U_{mf}$ can be divided into a dense (or emulsion) phase and a bubble phase. The dense phase remains at the conditions of minimum fluidization, characterized by a voidage $\\epsilon_{mf}$ and a height $H_{mf}$. The excess gas, with a superficial velocity of $(U - U_{mf})$, passes through the bed as bubbles.\n\nThe total height of the fluidized bed, $H$, expands beyond $H_{mf}$ due to the volume occupied by the bubbles.
