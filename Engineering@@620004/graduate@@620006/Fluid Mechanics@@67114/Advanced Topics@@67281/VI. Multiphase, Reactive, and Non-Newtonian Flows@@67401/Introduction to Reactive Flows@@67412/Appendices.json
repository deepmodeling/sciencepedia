This density change is quantified by the density ratio, $\\sigma = \\frac{\\rho_u}{\\rho_b}$. For typical hydrocarbon-air flames, $\\sigma$ is in the range of 5 to 8. The flow is in the low-Mach-number regime, which implies that the pressure change across the flame is small compared to the absolute pressure, i.e., $|p_b - p_u| \\ll p_u$.\n\nBy applying the integral form of the steady, one-dimensional conservation equations of mass and momentum across the flame front, derive an expression for the small pressure drop across the flame, $\\Delta p = p_u - p_b$.
