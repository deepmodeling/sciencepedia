The flame is subject to volumetric heat loss due to optically thin radiation from the hot product gases. The analysis of this phenomenon relies on several key simplifying assumptions and theoretical results from large activation energy asymptotics (AEA).\n\n**Given Information and Assumptions:**\n1.  The flame is treated as an infinitesimally thin sheet where the chemical reaction occurs. This sheet separates a preheat zone (unburnt gas) from a post-flame zone (burnt gas).\n2.  The Lewis number is unity ($Le=1$). The pressure, specific heat capacity $c_p$, and thermal conductivity $k$ are constant throughout.\n3.  The volumetric radiative heat loss rate, $\\dot{q}_{rad}$, is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law for an optically thin medium:\n    $$ \\dot{q}_{rad} = A(T^4 - T_u^4) $$\n    where $A$ is a constant representing the Planck mean absorption coefficient and geometry factors, $T$ is the local gas temperature, and $T_u$ is the temperature of the unburnt gas mixture far upstream.\n4.  A detailed analysis balancing heat generation, conduction, convection, and radiation yields a relationship between the mass burning rate per unit area, $\\dot{m}$, and the temperature of the flame sheet, $T_f$:\n    $$ \\dot{m}^2 = \\frac{k A (T_f^4 - T_u^4)}{c_p^2 (T_{ad} - T_f)} $$\n    Here, $T_{ad}$ is the adiabatic flame temperature, which is the temperature the flame would achieve in the absence of any heat loss.\n5.
