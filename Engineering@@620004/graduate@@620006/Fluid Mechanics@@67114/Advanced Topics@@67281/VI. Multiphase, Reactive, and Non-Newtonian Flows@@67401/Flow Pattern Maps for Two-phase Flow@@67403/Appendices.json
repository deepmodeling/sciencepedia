It is scientifically grounded in the principles of two-phase fluid dynamics and heat transfer, it is well-posed, objective, and all provided data are physically consistent and sufficient for a qualitative analysis based on fundamental principles and dimensionless reasoning.\n\nThe problem requires an analysis of the effect of channel orientation (horizontal versus vertical upflow) on the flow boiling of water at a low mass flux of $G = 100\\,\\mathrm{kg\\,m^{-2}\\,s^{-1}}$. The key to this analysis is the competition between inertial forces, which tend to homogenize the mixture, and gravitational forces, which tend to cause phase separation due to the large density difference between liquid and vapor. The densities are given as $\\rho_\\ell \\approx 958\\,\\mathrm{kg\\,m^{-3}}$ for liquid water and $\\rho_g \\approx 0.60\\,\\mathrm{kg\\,m^{-3}}$ for vapor. The hydraulic diameter is $D_h = 10\\,\\mathrm{mm} = 0.01\\,\\mathrm{m}$, and the gravitational acceleration is $g = 9.81\\,\\mathrm{m\\,s^{-2}}$.\n\nIn a horizontal channel, the gravitational force acts perpendicular to the primary direction of flow. This transverse body force causes the less dense vapor phase to rise to the top of the channel and the more dense liquid phase to settle at the bottom. This phenomenon is known as stratification. The inertial forces of the flow resist this segregation. The balance between these two effects can be characterized by a Froude number, $Fr$. A relevant form of this number compares a characteristic kinetic energy to a characteristic potential energy, for example, $Fr = U_m^2/(g D_h)$, where $U_m$ is a characteristic mixture velocity. If $Fr \\ll 1$, gravitational forces dominate, and stratification is expected. If $Fr \\gg 1$, inertial forces dominate, and the flow is more likely to be in an annular or dispersed regime where the phase distribution is more symmetric about the channel axis.\n\nLet us estimate the Froude number for the given conditions. The flow enters as a saturated liquid (quality $x=0$) and vapor is generated along the length. Near the inlet, in the liquid-dominated regime, the mixture velocity $U_m$ can be approximated by the liquid velocity, $U_\\ell = G/\\rho_\\ell$.\n$$U_m \\approx U_\\ell = \\frac{G}{\\rho_\\ell} = \\frac{100\\,\\mathrm{kg\\,m^{-2}\\,s^{-1}}}{958\\,\\mathrm{kg\\,m^{-3}}} \\approx 0.104\\,\\mathrm{m\\,s^{-1}}$$\nThe Froude number in this region is:\n$$Fr = \\frac{U_m^2}{g D_h} \\approx \\frac{(0.104\\,\\mathrm{m\\,s^{-1}})^2}{(9.81\\,\\mathrm{m\\,s^{-2}})(0.01\\,\\mathrm{m})} \\approx \\frac{0.0108\\,\\mathrm{m^2\\,s^{-2}}}{0.0981\\,\\mathrm{m^2\\,s^{-2}}} \\approx 0.11$$\nSince $Fr \\approx 0.11 < 1$, we can conclude that gravitational effects are significant, and stratification is likely to occur in the horizontal channel, at least in the low-quality region near the inlet.\n\nIn a vertical upflow channel, the gravitational force acts parallel to the direction of flow, opposing it. It does not create a transverse hydrostatic pressure gradient across the channel. Therefore, gravity does not cause the kind of stratification seen in horizontal flow. The phase distribution is instead governed by other phenomena, such as interfacial shear stress, lift forces on bubbles, and turbulent transport. These effects typically lead to more axisymmetric flow patterns. In upflow, the lighter vapor phase tends to migrate toward the center of the channel, forming a core that moves faster than the surrounding liquid phase, which is distributed as a film along the wall. This is known as the core-annular flow pattern.\n\nWith this physical framework, we can now evaluate each statement.\n\nA. In a horizontal channel at low $G$, the gravitational body force acts transverse to the flow and promotes phase segregation, producing a stratified or plug-slug arrangement with vapor preferentially at the top and liquid at the bottom. This occurs when a transverse Froude number $Fr \\sim U_m^2/(g D_h)$ is much less than unity, where $U_m$ is a characteristic mixture velocity; increasing $G$ suppresses stratification and favors annular or dispersed regimes.\nThis statement is a correct and complete description of the phenomena in a horizontal channel. It correctly identifies the role of gravity, the resulting flow patterns (stratified, plug-slug), the relevant dimensionless criterion ($Fr \\ll 1$), and the effect of increasing the mass flux $G$. Our calculation confirms that for the given conditions, $Fr < 1$.\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\nB. In vertical upflow, the gravitational body force is aligned with the axis, so it does not produce a lateral hydrostatic pressure gradient. Interfacial shear and turbulent transport tend to drive the denser liquid toward the wall and the lighter vapor toward the centerline, yielding an axisymmetric core-annular structure at moderate to high $G$.\nThis statement accurately describes the physics of vertical upflow. The absence of a transverse gravitational effect is key. The description of phase migration leading to a core-annular flow pattern (vapor core, liquid film) is a standard and correct depiction of a common regime in vertical two-phase flow.\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\nC. Orientation has negligible effect on the hydrodynamics of flow boiling because the two-phase friction factor depends only on a Reynolds number based on $G$; thus, flow pattern and phase distribution are independent of channel orientation.\nThis statement is fundamentally incorrect. As demonstrated by the analysis for horizontal and vertical flows, orientation has a profound effect on the flow pattern, especially at low to moderate mass fluxes like $G = 100\\,\\mathrm{kg\\,m^{-2}\\,s^{-1}}$. The assertion that the two-phase friction factor depends only on a single Reynolds number is a gross oversimplification and is false; these factors are highly dependent on the flow pattern itself, which is influenced by orientation.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\nD. In a horizontal channel at low $G$, stratification places the lighter phase at the bottom because the static pressure is lower there, and high wall shear at low $G$ tends to pin the denser liquid to the top of the channel.\nThis statement contains multiple errors. Due to buoyancy, the lighter phase (vapor) rises to the top, not the bottom. The hydrostatic pressure at the bottom of a horizontal channel is higher, not lower, than at the top ($p_{bottom} = p_{top} + \\rho g D_h$). The claim of \"high wall shear at low $G$\" is contradictory, as low mass flux implies low velocity and thus low shear. Shear forces do not \"pin\" liquid to the top against gravity.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\nE. A useful criterion for stratification in horizontal channels is to compare the transverse hydrostatic head $\\Delta p_h \\sim \\rho_\\ell g D_h$ to a representative dynamic pressure $\\sim \\rho_m U_m^2$, where $\\rho_m$ is a characteristic mixture density. When $\\rho_\\ell g D_h \\gg \\rho_m U_m^2$, gravity dominates inertia across the section and stratification is favored. Under the given conditions, estimating $U_m \\approx G/\\rho_\\ell$ in the liquid-dominated regime yields a transverse Froude number $Fr \\ll 1$, so stratification is likely.\nThis statement presents the physical competition in terms of a pressure balance, which is a valid and insightful approach. The transverse hydrostatic head, $\\Delta p_h \\approx \\rho_\\ell g D_h$, is the driving potential for stratification. The dynamic pressure, $p_{dyn} \\sim \\rho_m U_m^2$, represents the homogenizing effect of inertia. The condition for stratification, $\\rho_\\ell g D_h \\gg \\rho_m U_m^2$, is correct. The analysis then correctly applies this to the liquid-dominated inlet region, approximating $\\rho_m \\approx \\rho_\\ell$ and $U_m \\approx G/\\rho_\\ell$.\nLet's verify the numerical comparison:\nHydrostatic head: $\\rho_\\ell g D_h \\approx 958\\,\\mathrm{kg\\,m^{-3}} \\times 9.81\\,\\mathrm{m\\,s^{-2}} \\times 0.01\\,\\mathrm{m} \\approx 94.0\\,\\mathrm{Pa}$.\nDynamic pressure: $\\rho_\\ell U_m^2 \\approx G^2/\\rho_\\ell = (100\\,\\mathrm{kg\\,m^{-2}\\,s^{-1}})^2 / (958\\,\\mathrm{kg\\,m^{-3}}) \\approx 10.4\\,\\mathrm{Pa}$.\nSince $94.0\\,\\mathrm{Pa} \\gg 10.4\\,\\mathrm{Pa}$ (or at least significantly larger), the conclusion that stratification is likely is well-founded. This approach is equivalent to the Froude number analysis in option A. The statement is entirely correct.\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\nThe correct statements are A, B, and E.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{ABE}$$", "id": "2488270"}]}
