We can group the terms that are assumed to be independent of pressure at constant temperature into a single pre-exponential factor, $A$:\n$$k(P) = A \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}(P)}{RT}\\right)$$\nwhere the pressure dependence of $k$ arises solely from the pressure dependence of $\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}(P)$.\n\nThe fundamental thermodynamic definition of the volume of a system is the partial derivative of its Gibbs energy with respect to pressure at constant temperature:\n$$\\left( \\frac{\\partial G}{\\partial P} \\right)_T = V$$\nApplying this relation to the activation process (Reactant $\\rightarrow$ Transition State), we obtain the definition of the activation volume, $\\Delta V^{\\ddagger}$:\n$$\\left( \\frac{\\partial \\Delta G^{\\ddagger}}{\\partial P} \\right)_T = \\Delta V^{\\ddagger}$$\nwhere $\\Delta V^{\\ddagger}$ is the difference between the molar volume of the transition state and the molar volume of the reactant(s).\n\nTo find the effect of a finite pressure change $\\Delta P$ on $\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}$, we must integrate this differential equation.

It presents a standard model in chemical kinetics and asks for an analysis of its behavior, specifically the origin of negative apparent activation energies. We may proceed with the solution.\n\nFirst, we derive the rate law for product formation. The rate of formation of the stabilized product $AB$ is:\n$$\\frac{d[AB]}{dt} = k_2 [AB^*] [M]$$\nThe energized complex $AB^*$ is a highly reactive, short-lived intermediate. We can therefore apply the steady-state approximation (SSA) to its concentration, $[AB^*]$:\n$$\\frac{d[AB^*]}{dt} = k_1 [A][B] - k_{-1} [AB^*] - k_2 [AB^*] [M] \\approx 0$$\nSolving for the steady-state concentration of the complex, we find:\n$$[AB^*] (k_{-1} + k_2 [M]) = k_1 [A][B]$$\n$$[AB^*] = \\frac{k_1 [A][B]}{k_{-1} + k_2 [M]}$$\nSubstituting this expression for $[AB^*]$ back into the rate law for product formation gives:\n$$\\frac{d[AB]}{dt} = k_2 [M] \\left( \\frac{k_1 [A][B]}{k_{-1} + k_2 [M]} \\right) = \\left( \\frac{k_1 k_2 [M]}{k_{-1} + k_2 [M]} \\right) [A][B]$$\nThe problem states that the rate law is empirically found to be second-order, with an effective rate coefficient $k_{\\text{eff}}(T, [M])$. By comparing our derived rate law with the form $\\frac{d[AB]}{dt} = k_{\\text{eff}} [A][B]$, we identify the effective second-order rate coefficient as:\n$$k_{\\text{eff}}(T, [M]) = \\frac{k_1 k_2 [M]}{k_{-1} + k_2 [M]}$$\nThe apparent activation energy, $E_a$, is defined by the Arrhenius relation:\n$$E_a \\equiv -R \\frac{d(\\ln k_{\\text{eff}})}{d(1/T)}$$\nA negative apparent activation energy implies that $k_{\\text{eff}}$ decreases as temperature $T$ increases. To analyze this, we must consider the temperature dependence of the elementary rate constants $k_1$, $k_{-1}$, and $k_2$:\n- $k_1$: The capture rate. For neutral, barrierless reactions, this is determined by long-range forces and collision dynamics. It typically has a weak temperature dependence, often modeled as $k_1 \\propto T^n$ where $n$ is small (e.g., $1/2$ from simple collision theory, or even negative like $-1/6$ for capture controlled by dispersion forces). The corresponding activation energy, $E_{a,1}$, is small and can be slightly negative.\n- $k_2$: The collisional stabilization rate. This is a bimolecular collision rate and is proportional to the average relative speed, so $k_2 \\propto T^{1/2}$. The activation energy $E_{a,2}$ is small and positive ($E_{a,2} = RT/2$).\n- $k_{-1}$: The redissociation rate. This is the unimolecular decay of the energized complex. It is a strongly activated process because energy must be partitioned into the reaction coordinate to break the nascent bond. Therefore, $k_{-1}$ increases sharply with temperature, and its activation energy, $E_{a,-1}$, is large and positive.\n\nNow, we analyze the behavior of $k_{\\text{eff}}$ in the limiting pressure regimes.\n\n**Low-Pressure Limit ($[M] \\rightarrow 0$)**:\nIn this limit, collisional stabilization is rare, so $k_2 [M] \\ll k_{-1}$. The expression for $k_{\\text{eff}}$ simplifies to:\n$$k_{\\text{eff, low}} \\approx \\frac{k_1 k_2 [M]}{k_{-1}}$$\nTaking the natural logarithm: $\\ln k_{\\text{eff, low}} \\approx \\ln k_1 + \\ln k_2 + \\ln [M] - \\ln k_{-1}$.\nApplying the definition of apparent activation energy (assuming $[M]$ is independent of $T$):\n$$E_{a, \\text{low}} = E_{a,1} + E_{a,2} - E_{a,-1}$$\nSince $E_{a,-1}$ is large and positive, while $E_{a,1}$ and $E_{a,2}$ are small, the overall apparent activation energy $E_{a, \\text{low}}$ is dominated by the $-E_{a,-1}$ term and is therefore large and negative.\n\n**High-Pressure Limit ($[M] \\rightarrow \\infty$)**:\nIn this limit, collisional stabilization is very fast and efficient, so $k_2 [M] \\gg k_{-1}$. Every complex that forms is stabilized. The expression for $k_{\\text{eff}}$ simplifies to:\n$$k_{\\text{eff, high}} \\approx \\frac{k_1 k_2 [M]}{k_2 [M]} = k_1$$\nThe reaction rate is limited solely by the initial capture step. The apparent activation energy is:\n$$E_{a, \\text{high}} = E_{a,1}$$\nIn this limit, the apparent activation energy is simply the activation energy of the capture step, which is typically small and can be slightly negative.\n\nWith this theoretical framework, we evaluate each option.\n\n**A. In the low-pressure regime where the energized complex rarely undergoes multiple collisions before either stabilizing or redissociating, the effective bimolecular rate coefficient is proportional to the product of the capture and deactivation rates divided by the redissociation rate. If the redissociation of the energized complex $AB^*$ accelerates with increasing temperature faster than capture or deactivation do, the observed $k_{\\text{eff}}(T,[M])$ decreases with $T$, yielding a negative apparent activation energy.**\nOur analysis of the low-pressure limit yielded $k_{\\text{eff, low}} \\approx (k_1 k_2 / k_{-1}) [M]$, which confirms the first part of the statement. The second part states that if $k_{-1}$ increases with temperature more rapidly than $k_1$ and $k_2$, the overall rate coefficient $k_{\\text{eff}}$ will decrease. This corresponds precisely to our finding that $E_{a, \\text{low}} = E_{a,1} + E_{a,2} - E_{a,-1}$. The large, positive activation energy $E_{a,-1}$ for redissociation ensures that $k_{-1}$ grows very fast with $T$, making $E_{a, \\text{low}}$ negative. This statement is a correct and fundamental explanation for the observed phenomenon.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. Negative apparent activation energy cannot arise in a barrierless association because activation energy is determined only by the height of a potential energy barrier along the minimum-energy path, which is zero here by construction.**\nThis statement is fundamentally flawed. It incorrectly equates the *apparent* activation energy of a multi-step reaction with the activation energy of a single elementary step, specifically one defined by a potential energy barrier. As derived, the apparent $E_a$ is a composite quantity, $E_a = f(E_{a,1}, E_{a,-1}, E_{a,2}, T, [M])$. In the low-pressure limit, a large negative $E_a$ arises from the competition between temperature-dependent pathways (redissociation vs. stabilization), not from a potential energy barrier. Hence, a barrierless association can, and often does, exhibit a negative apparent activation energy.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. At fixed temperature, raising the bath gas concentration $[M]$ can move the system from a fall-off regime dominated by competition with redissociation into a high-pressure regime where stabilization is nearly certain on the timescale of complex lifetimes; as a result, the sign and magnitude of the apparent activation energy can change because $k_{\\text{eff}}(T,[M])$ crosses over from being limited by redissociation to being limited by capture.**\nOur analysis shows that as $[M]$ increases, $k_{\\text{eff}}$ transitions from $k_{\\text{eff, low}} \\approx (k_1 k_2 / k_{-1}) [M]$ to $k_{\\text{eff, high}} = k_1$. This transition is known as the \"fall-off\" regime. Concurrently, the apparent activation energy transitions from $E_{a, \\text{low}} \\approx E_{a,1} + E_{a,2} - E_{a,-1}$ (large and negative) to $E_{a, \\text{high}} = E_{a,1}$ (small, possibly slightly negative). This is a crossover from kinetics limited by collisional stabilization (in competition with redissociation) to kinetics limited by capture. The statement accurately describes this pressure-dependent crossover and its effect on the apparent activation energy.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**D. In the high-pressure limit, if long-range attractive interactions between $A$ and $B$ dominate capture so that the capture-controlled rate exhibits a weak inverse temperature dependence, the apparent activation energy can remain slightly negative even when collisional stabilization is no longer rate limiting.**\nIn the high-pressure limit, we found $k_{\\text{eff}} = k_1$ and $E_a = E_{a,1}$. The statement proposes that $k_1$ can have a weak inverse temperature dependence, meaning it decreases as $T$ increases. This is physically plausible for barrierless association reactions where capture is dictated by long-range attractive potentials (e.g., $V(r) \\propto -1/r^6$). For such potentials, trajectories at higher kinetic energy are less easily deflected into a capture orbit, leading to a smaller capture cross-section and a rate constant $k_1$ that weakly decreases with $T$. This corresponds to a small, negative activation energy $E_{a,1}$. Thus, a slightly negative $E_a$ can persist even at the high-pressure limit.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**E. The origin of negative apparent activation energies in association reactions is a universal decrease of the pre-exponential factor with increasing temperature due to a reduced collision frequency of gas molecules, which holds across all pressures and mechanisms.**\nThis statement contains multiple falsehoods. First, the collision frequency of gas molecules is proportional to the mean relative speed, which scales as $T^{1/2}$. Therefore, collision frequency *increases* with temperature, it does not decrease. Second, the explanation for negative $E_a$ is not \"universal across all pressures.\" Our analysis clearly shows distinct reasons in the low-pressure limit (dominance of $k_{-1}$) versus the high-pressure limit (behavior of $k_1$). The large negative $E_a$ at low pressures arises from an exponential term related to $k_{-1}$, not a weak power-law dependence in a pre-exponential factor. The statement is factually incorrect and misrepresents the underlying physics.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{ACD}$$", "id": "2958209"}]}
