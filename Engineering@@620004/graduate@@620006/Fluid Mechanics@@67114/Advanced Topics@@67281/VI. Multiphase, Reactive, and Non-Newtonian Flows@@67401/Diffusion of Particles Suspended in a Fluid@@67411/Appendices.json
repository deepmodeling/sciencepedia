The particles also exhibit random thermal motion, which is characterized by a diffusion coefficient $D$.\n\nThe particles can be absorbed at the surface $x=0$ through a first-order chemical reaction. The number of particles reacting per unit area per unit time is given by $k C(0)$, where $k$ is the reaction rate constant (with units of velocity) and $C(x)$ is the particle concentration at position $x$.

This exercise [@problem_id:486513] invites you to a hypothetical scenario involving a Bingham plastic, a material that acts like a solid below a certain stress.

A Bingham plastic is a viscoplastic material characterized by a yield stress, $\\tau_y$. For shear stresses below $\\tau_y$, the material behaves as a rigid solid, while for stresses exceeding $\\tau_y$, it flows as a fluid.\n\nDue to thermal energy, the suspended particle experiences random impulses from the fluid molecules, a phenomenon known as Brownian motion. These impulses result in a characteristic random thermal force, $F_{th}$. For the particle to diffuse, this thermal force must be sufficient to overcome the resistance of the Bingham plastic, which forms a 'cage' of unyielded material around the particle.\n\nTo model this system, we make the following assumptions:\n1.  The characteristic thermal force $F_{th}$ acting on the particle is related to the thermal energy scale, $k_B T$ (where $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant), by considering the work done over the particle's characteristic length scale, its radius $R$. This gives the approximate relation $F_{th} \\approx \\frac{k_B T}{R}$.\n2.  The minimum force required to break the rigid cage and initiate motion of the spherical particle, known as the yield force $F_y$, is directly proportional to the yield stress $\\tau_y$ and the particle's projected area. This relationship is given by $F_y = \\alpha \\pi R^2 \\tau_y$, where $\\alpha$ is a dimensionless constant known as the yield coefficient, which depends on the geometry of the flow.\n\nIf the particle's radius is too small, the corresponding thermal force will be insufficient to overcome the yield force, and the particle will be effectively trapped, ceasing to diffuse.\n\nDerive an expression for the critical radius, $R_c$, below which the particle becomes caged by the Bingham plastic.
