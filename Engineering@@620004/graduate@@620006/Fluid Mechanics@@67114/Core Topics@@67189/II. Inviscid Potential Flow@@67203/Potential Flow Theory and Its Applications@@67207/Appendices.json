Vortex Motion**\nA vortex moves with the local fluid velocity induced by all other sources of flow. The velocity of the vortex at $z_1$ is determined by the stagnation flow, the other vortex at $z_2$, and the two image vortices.\nThe velocity $(\\dot{x}_1, \\dot{y}_1)$ of the vortex at $z_1$ is given by Routh's rule, which in complex form is:\n$$ \\dot{\\bar{z}}_1 = \\left( \\frac{dW_{other,1}}{dz} \\right)_{z=z_1} $$\nwhere $W_{other,1}(z)$ is the complex potential of the flow field excluding the vortex at $z_1$.\n$$W_{other,1}(z) = W_{stag}(z) + W_{vortex,2}(z) + W_{image,1}(z) + W_{image,2}(z)$$\n$$W_{other,1}(z) = \\frac{A}{2}z^2 + \\frac{i\\Gamma}{2\\pi}\\log(z-z_2) + \\frac{i\\Gamma}{2\\pi}\\log(z-\\bar{z}_1) - \\frac{i\\Gamma}{2\\pi}\\log(z-\\bar{z}_2)$$\nThe derivative is:\n$$\\frac{dW_{other,1}}{dz} = Az + \\frac{i\\Gamma}{2\\pi}\\left( \\frac{1}{z-z_2} + \\frac{1}{z-\\bar{z}_1} - \\frac{1}{z-\\bar{z}_2} \\right)$$\n\n**4.
