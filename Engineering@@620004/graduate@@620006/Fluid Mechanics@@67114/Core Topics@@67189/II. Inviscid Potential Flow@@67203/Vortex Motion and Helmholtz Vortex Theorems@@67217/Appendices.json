Initial Geometry**\nFor an equilateral triangle with side length $L_0$, the distance from the centroid to any vertex, $R_0$, is given by:\n$$R_0 = \\frac{L_0}{2 \\cos(30^\\circ)} = \\frac{L_0}{2(\\sqrt{3}/2)} = \\frac{L_0}{\\sqrt{3}}$$\nSo, at $t=0$, we have $R(0) = R_0 = L_0/\\sqrt{3}$.

Velocity induced by other vortices**\nThe velocity of a given vortex is the sum of the velocities induced by the other two vortices and the sink. Let's focus on the velocity component due to the other vortices first. By symmetry, the three vortices will always form an equilateral triangle, which rotates and shrinks. The distance from the center to any vertex is $R(t)$, and the side length of the triangle is $L(t) = \\sqrt{3}R(t)$.\n\nLet's consider one vortex, say vortex 1, and calculate the velocity induced on it by vortices 2 and 3.

The tangential components add up. The velocity vector from vortex 2 to vortex 1 makes an angle of $30^\\circ$ (or $\\pi/6$ radians) with the radial direction from the origin to vortex 1. Thus, the tangential component of the velocity from vortex 2 is $\\frac{\\Gamma}{2\\pi L} \\cos(30^\\circ)$.
