The system employs a spinning cylinder of radius $R$ to generate a transverse force. To characterize its performance, a prototype of the cylinder is tested in two different environments: a wind tunnel filled with air and a water channel. In both tests, the fluid approaches the cylinder with a uniform velocity $U$ perpendicular to the cylinder's axis, and the cylinder spins with a constant angular velocity $\\omega$.
