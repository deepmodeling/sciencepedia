By analyzing how a flap changes the entire lift-versus-angle-of-attack curve, you will develop a deeper understanding of lift augmentation, stall characteristics, and pitching moments [@problem_id:1733788].", "problem": "An aerospace engineering student is studying the aerodynamic characteristics of a particular symmetric airfoil intended for use on a light aircraft. For a symmetric airfoil in an incompressible, inviscid flow, the lift coefficient ($C_L$) is zero at a zero angle of attack ($\\alpha$). The student is interested in how the airfoil's performance changes when a simple trailing-edge flap is deflected downwards.\n\nAssume the aircraft is in a flight regime where the flow can be considered incompressible. Consider the characteristic curve of the lift coefficient, $C_L$, versus the angle of attack, $\\alpha$. Which of the following statements accurately describe the changes to the aerodynamic properties of the airfoil when the flap is deployed downwards, compared to the clean configuration (no flap deflection)?\n\nSelect all statements that apply.\n\nA.

At a fixed positive angle of attack well below the stall condition, the aerodynamic pitching moment about the airfoil's quarter-chord point becomes more negative (i.e., a stronger nose-down moment is generated).", "solution": "We model the airfoil in incompressible, inviscid, two-dimensional flow using thin airfoil theory for the linear range and standard aerodynamic reasoning for stall and maximum lift, which require viscous/separation considerations.\n\nFirst, in the linear (pre-stall) regime, thin airfoil theory gives the lift in the form\n$$\nC_{L} = a_{\\alpha}\\left(\\alpha - \\alpha_{L=0}\\right),\n$$\nwith $a_{\\alpha} = \\frac{dC_{L}}{d\\alpha} \\approx 2\\pi$ (per radian) for a thin airfoil, independent of camber. Introducing a trailing-edge flap deflection $\\delta_{f}$ adds an incremental lift contribution, so one writes\n$$\nC_{L} = a_{\\alpha}\\,\\alpha + a_{\\delta}\\,\\delta_{f} + \\text{(higher-order terms)},\n$$\nwhere $a_{\\alpha} \\approx 2\\pi$ remains approximately unchanged by camber and $a_{\\delta}>0$ for a downward-deflected flap (because it increases circulation and lift at a given $\\alpha$). Comparing to the canonical form, the zero-lift angle satisfies\n$$\n0 = a_{\\alpha}\\,\\alpha_{L=0} + a_{\\delta}\\,\\delta_{f} \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad \\alpha_{L=0} = -\\frac{a_{\\delta}}{a_{\\alpha}}\\delta_{f}.\n$$\nFor a downward flap, $\\delta_{f}>0$ and $a_{\\delta}>0$, so $\\alpha_{L=0}<0$. Meanwhile the lift curve slope with respect to $\\alpha$ is\n$$\n\\frac{dC_{L}}{d\\alpha} = a_{\\alpha} \\approx 2\\pi,\n$$\nwhich remains approximately constant when camber is introduced by the flap in the linear range. Therefore, statements A and B are true.\n\nNext, consider the effects on maximum lift and stall. While thin airfoil theory does not predict stall, empirical and theoretical understanding of boundary-layer behavior indicate that a downward flap increases effective camber and shifts the pressure distribution to produce higher lift at a given $\\alpha$, thereby increasing $C_{L,\\max}$ before stall. However, a simple (plain) flap typically promotes earlier trailing-edge separation due to increased adverse pressure gradient on the aft upper surface, reducing the stall angle of attack compared to the clean configuration. Thus, $C_{L,\\max}$ increases, but $\\alpha_{\\text{stall}}$ does not increase; it typically decreases. Hence C is true and D is false.\n\nFinally, for the aerodynamic pitching moment about the quarter-chord, thin airfoil theory gives a moment coefficient $C_{m,c/4}$ that is independent of $\\alpha$ in the linear range and depends on camber. A symmetric airfoil has $C_{m,c/4}=0$ in the clean configuration. Introducing positive camber via a downward flap makes $C_{m,c/4}$ more negative (nose-down). Therefore, at a fixed positive $\\alpha$ well below stall, the pitching moment about the quarter-chord becomes more negative with the flap deflected. Hence E is true.\n\nCollecting the correct statements, the set is A, B, C, E.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{ABCE}$$", "id": "1733788"}, {"introduction": "The characteristics of a two-dimensional airfoil are essential, but real wings exist in three dimensions.
