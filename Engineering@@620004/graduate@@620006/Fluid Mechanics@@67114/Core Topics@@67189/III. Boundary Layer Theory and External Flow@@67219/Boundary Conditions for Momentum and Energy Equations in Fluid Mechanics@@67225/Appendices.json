A common choice that simplifies the inertial terms is $P_c = \\rho_0 U_c^2 = \\rho_0(\\alpha/L)^2$. So, $p^* = p'/P_c = p'L^2/(\\rho_0\\alpha^2)$.\n\n**3.

Boundary Conditions**\n- Velocity: No-slip condition $u_x=u_y=0$ on all walls ($x=0,L$; $y=0,L$). In non-dimensional form this is $u=v=0$ on all boundaries of the unit square $[0,1]\\times[0,1]$.\n- Temperature:\n    - $x=0$: $T = T_h \\implies \\theta = (T_h-T_c)/(T_h-T_c) = 1$.\n    - $x=1$ (i.e. $x=L$): $T = T_c \\implies \\theta = (T_c-T_c)/(T_h-T_c) = 0$.\n    - $y=0,1$ (i.e. $y=0,L$): Adiabatic means zero normal heat flux, $-k(\\partial T/\\partial y) = 0 \\implies \\partial T/\\partial y=0$. This becomes $\\frac{\\Delta T}{L}\\frac{\\partial \\theta}{\\partial y} = 0 \\implies \\partial\\theta/\\partial y=0$.\n\nThis completes the derivation. Now, we evaluate the given options against this result.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A) Evaluation:**\n- **Governing Equations**: The equations for continuity, x-momentum, y-momentum, and energy are identical to those derived. The placement and form of the Prandtl number, and the $Ra \\cdot Pr$ group for buoyancy, are correct for the specified diffusion time scaling.\n- **Boundary Conditions**: The no-slip velocity conditions ($u=v=0$) and the thermal conditions ($\\theta=1$ at $x=0$, $\\theta=0$ at $x=1$, $\\partial\\theta/\\partial y=0$ at $y=0,1$) are all correct.\n- **Parameters**: The definitions $Pr = \\nu/\\alpha$ and $Ra = g\\beta\\Delta T L^3/(\\nu\\alpha)$ are correct.\n- **Verdict**: **Correct**. This option provides a fully consistent and correct formulation based on the specified scales.\n\n**B) Evaluation:**\n- **Governing Equations**:\n    - The momentum equations lack the $Pr$ factor in the viscous terms. This corresponds to using a viscous time scale ($t_c=L^2/\\nu$), which contradicts the problem statement's requirement to use the thermal diffusion time scale ($t_c=L^2/\\alpha$).\n    - The energy equation has a factor of $1/Pr$ on the diffusion term, which is also a consequence of using the viscous time scale.\n    - The buoyancy term is given as $Gr\\,\\theta$, where $Gr = g\\beta\\Delta T L^3/\\nu^2$. The use of $Gr$ is characteristic of viscous scaling, not the required thermal scaling.\n- **Boundary Conditions**: The condition $\\theta=1/2$ on the horizontal walls is a Dirichlet condition, contradicting the \"perfectly adiabatic\" (Neumann) condition specified in the problem statement.\n- **Verdict**: **Incorrect**. The scaling is inconsistent with the problem specification, and the thermal boundary conditions are factually wrong.\n\n**C) Evaluation:**\n- **Governing Equations**:\n    - A buoyancy term $Ra\\,Pr\\,\\theta$ appears in the x-momentum equation. Gravity acts only in the y-direction, so no buoyancy force should exist in the x-direction.\n    - The buoyancy term in the y-momentum equation has a negative sign. Since $T_h>T_c$, hot fluid (larger $\\theta$) would be forced downwards, which is physically incorrect. Buoyancy should act against gravity.\n- **Boundary Conditions**:\n    - The thermal conditions on the vertical walls, $\\theta=0$ at $x=0$ and $\\theta=1$ at $x=1$, are reversed.\n    - The adiabatic condition for the horizontal walls is given as $\\partial\\theta/\\partial x=0$. For a wall at $y=const$, the normal direction is $y$, so the condition must be $\\partial\\theta/\\partial y=0$.\n- **Parameters**: The Prandtl number is defined as $Pr = \\alpha/\\nu$, which is the inverse of the standard definition.\n- **Verdict**: **Incorrect**. This option contains multiple fundamental errors in physics, boundary conditions, and definitions.\n\n**D) Evaluation:**\n- **Governing Equations**: The coefficients are inconsistent with the specified scaling.\n    - The viscous term in the momentum equations is scaled by $1/Pr$, whereas the derivation shows it should be scaled by $Pr$.\n    - The buoyancy term in the y-momentum equation is $Ra\\,\\theta$. The derivation shows it must be $Ra\\,Pr\\,\\theta$ for this choice of scaling.\n    - The diffusion term in the energy equation is scaled by $Pr$. The derivation shows its coefficient should be $1$.\n- These inconsistencies show that the equations were not derived from the specified characteristic scales. For example, the form $Ra\\,\\theta$ in the buoyancy term appears with different velocity scalings, such as $U_c = \\sqrt{g\\beta\\Delta T L}$, which was not specified.\n- **Verdict**: **Incorrect**. The non-dimensional coefficients in the governing equations are wrong for the prescribed scaling scheme.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2509872"}]}
