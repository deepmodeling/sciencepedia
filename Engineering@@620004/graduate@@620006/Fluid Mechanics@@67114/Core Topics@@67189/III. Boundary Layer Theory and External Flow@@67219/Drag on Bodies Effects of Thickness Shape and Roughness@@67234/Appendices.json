This first practice helps dissect the total drag on a streamlined body into its two key components in low-speed flow: skin friction drag from viscous forces and form drag from pressure imbalances. By working through this exercise, you will explore the relationship between a body's thickness and the balance between these two drag sources, a critical trade-off in airfoil and hydrofoil design. [@problem_id:489057]", "problem": "A thin, symmetric strut with a thickness-to-chord ratio $\\tau = t/c$ is placed in a uniform, incompressible, laminar flow of velocity $U_\\infty$. The chord length is $c$ and the fluid has kinematic viscosity $\\nu$. The Reynolds number based on the chord is $Re_c = U_\\infty c / \\nu$.\n\nThe total drag on the strut is the sum of friction drag ($D_f$) and form drag ($D_p$, also known as pressure drag). The objective is to find the condition under which these two drag components are equal.\n\nTo solve this problem, you will use the following well-established approximations from boundary layer theory:\n\n1.  **Friction Drag:** The friction drag on the strut can be approximated by calculating the drag on a flat plate with the same wetted area. For a flat plate of length $c$ in a laminar flow, the drag coefficient for *one side* is given by the Blasius solution:\n    $$C_{D,f, \\text{plate}} = \\frac{1.328}{\\sqrt{Re_c}}$$\n\n2.  **Form Drag:** The form drag arises because the boundary layer displacement thickness alters the effective shape of the body, preventing full pressure recovery on the aft section. A widely used model for the form drag coefficient ($C_{D,p}$) of a thin, streamlined body in laminar flow relates it to both the body's thickness and the characteristics of the boundary layer. For this problem, assume the form drag coefficient is given by:\n    $$C_{D,p} = (H+1) \\tau C_{D,f, \\text{plate}}$$\n    where $H = \\delta^*/\\theta$ is the boundary layer shape factor. For a laminar Blasius boundary layer, the shape factor is a constant.\n\nUsing this framework, derive an expression for the thickness-to-chord ratio $\\tau$ at which the total friction drag on the strut is equal to its form drag. Use the value for the laminar (Blasius) shape factor, $H = \\frac{253}{99}$.\n\n*Note: Drag coefficients are normalized by the planform area, $A = c \\times \\text{span}$, and the dynamic pressure, $q_\\infty = \\frac{1}{2}\\rho U_\\infty^2$.*", "solution": "The problem asks for the thickness-to-chord ratio $\\tau$ at which the friction drag on a thin symmetric strut equals its form drag.

The problem states that the friction drag is to be approximated by that of a flat plate with the same wetted area.

We set the expressions from Step 1 and Step 2 equal to each other:\n$$\\frac{2.656}{\\sqrt{Re_c}} = (H+1) \\tau \\frac{1.328}{\\sqrt{Re_c}}$$\n\n**Step 4: Solve for the thickness-to-chord ratio $\\tau$.**\n\nThe term $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{Re_c}}$ appears on both sides and can be cancelled, as long as $Re_c$ is finite and non-zero:\n$$2.656 = (H+1) \\tau \\cdot 1.328$$\n\nNotice that $2.656 = 2 \\times 1.328$.
