The interaction between these two components creates sealed chambers of expanding and contracting volume, which convert hydraulic pressure into mechanical work. A critical factor in the motor's efficiency is internal leakage, particularly the flow that bypasses the intended path by leaking through the narrow gaps at the dynamic sealing points between the rotor tips and the housing.\n\nConsider a simplified model of one such sealing interface. The gap between the tip of the inner rotor and the stationary outer housing is modeled as a two-dimensional channel between two parallel plates. The channel has a length $L$ and a constant height $h$, where $h \\ll L$. The bottom plate (representing the outer housing) is stationary. The top plate (representing the rotor tip) moves with a constant tangential velocity $U$ parallel to the bottom plate. A pressure difference $\\Delta P = P_1 - P_2 > 0$ is maintained across the length $L$ of the channel, with $P_1$ being the pressure at the inlet ($x=0$) and $P_2$ being the pressure at the outlet ($x=L$).\n\nThe fluid flowing through the gap is an incompressible Newtonian fluid with dynamic viscosity $\\mu$.
