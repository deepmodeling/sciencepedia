Reactants enter the front at state 1 and exit as products at state 2. The process involves an exothermic chemical reaction, which is modeled as a net heat addition, $q$, per unit mass of the fluid.\n\nThe flow across this front is governed by the following conservation laws, expressed in the reference frame of the stationary front:\n1.  **Mass Conservation:** $\\rho_1 u_1 = \\rho_2 u_2$\n2.  **Momentum Conservation:** $p_1 + \\rho_1 u_1^2 = p_2 + \\rho_2 u_2^2$\n3.  **Energy Conservation:** $h_1 + \\frac{1}{2} u_1^2 + q = h_2 + \\frac{1}{2} u_2^2$\n\nHere, $\\rho$ is the density, $u$ is the fluid velocity, $p$ is the pressure, and $h$ is the specific enthalpy. Subscripts 1 and 2 refer to the upstream (unburnt) and downstream (burnt) states, respectively. The gas is considered ideal, satisfying $p = \\rho R T$ and $h = c_p T$, where $R$ is the specific gas constant, $T$ is the temperature, and $c_p$ is the specific heat at constant pressure. The ratio of specific heats is $\\gamma = c_p/c_v$. The speed of sound is $a = \\sqrt{\\gamma R T}$, and the Mach number is $M = u/a$.\n\nFor a given subsonic upstream state ($M_1  1$), a physically realizable steady downstream state can only be achieved if the amount of heat added, $q$, does not exceed a certain critical value, $q_{max}$. If $q > q_{max}$, the flow is said to be thermally choked, and no steady-state solution exists. This maximum heat addition corresponds to the case where the downstream flow becomes sonic ($M_2=1$), a state known as a Chapman-Jouguet deflagration.\n\nYour task is to derive a closed-form expression for the maximum possible heat release, $q_{max}$, as a function of the upstream Mach number $M_1$, the upstream temperature $T_1$, the specific heat at constant pressure $c_p$, and the ratio of specific heats $\\gamma$.", "solution": "The derivation begins with the fundamental conservation equations for mass, momentum, and energy across the stationary deflagration front. The goal is to relate the heat addition $q$ to the change in Mach number from $M_1$ to $M_2$.\n\nFirst, we rewrite the conservation equations in terms of Mach number.\nThe momentum equation is $p_1 + \\rho_1 u_1^2 = p_2 + \\rho_2 u_2^2$. Using $u^2 = M^2 a^2 = M^2 (\\gamma p / \\rho)$, we can write $\\rho u^2 = \\gamma p M^2$.\nSo, $p_1(1 + \\gamma M_1^2) = p_2(1 + \\gamma M_2^2)$.

For a fixed $M_1$, we want to find the maximum possible value of $Q$, which we denote $Q_{max}$. This corresponds to finding the maximum of the right-hand side with respect to $M_2$.

A check of the second derivative (or the sign of the first derivative around $x=1$) confirms this is a maximum.
