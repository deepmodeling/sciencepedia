Statement of Core Principle**\nThe problem describes a gas cloud expanding adiabatically into a vacuum.\n- The expansion is adiabatic, meaning there is no heat exchange with the surroundings ($Q=0$).\n- The expansion is into a vacuum, meaning the external pressure is zero. Thus, the gas does no work on its surroundings ($W_{ext} = \\int p_{ext} dV = 0$).\n\nAccording to the first law of thermodynamics, the change in the total energy of the system, $\\Delta E_{total}$, is given by $\\Delta E_{total} = Q - W_{ext}$. Since both $Q$ and $W_{ext}$ are zero, the total energy of the gas cloud is conserved throughout the expansion.\n$$\nE_{total, \\text{initial}} = E_{total, \\text{final}}\n$$\n\n**2. Definition of Total Energy**\nThe total energy, $E_{total}$, of the gas cloud is the sum of its total internal energy, $U$, and its total kinetic energy, $K$.\n$$\nE_{total} = U + K\n$$\n\n**3. Analysis of the Initial State ($t=0$)**\nAt the initial moment, the gas cloud is at rest. Therefore, its initial bulk kinetic energy is zero.\n$$\nK_i = 0\n$$\nThe gas is confined within a sphere of radius $R_0$. The initial volume, $V_i$, is the volume of this sphere.\n$$\nV_i = \\frac{4}{3}\\pi R_0^3\n$$\nThe problem states that the initial temperature is $T_i = T_0$, and the total mass is $M$. The initial internal energy, $U_i$, can be found by substituting these initial conditions into the given expression for internal energy:\n$$\nU_i = U(T_0, V_i) = M c_v T_0 - \\frac{A M^2}{V_i}\n$$\nSubstituting the expression for $V_i$:\n$$\nU_i = M c_v T_0 - \\frac{A M^2}{\\frac{4}{3}\\pi R_0^3} = M c_v T_0 - \\frac{3A M^2}{4\\pi R_0^3}\n$$\nThe total initial energy of the system is:\n$$\nE_{total, i} = U_i + K_i = \\left( M c_v T_0 - \\frac{3A M^2}{4\\pi R_0^3} \\right) + 0 = M c_v T_0 - \\frac{3A M^2}{4\\pi R_0^3}\n$$\n\n**4. Analysis of the Final State ($t \\to \\infty$)**\nIn the final state, after a very long time, the gas has expanded significantly. The problem statement specifies that in this limit, the total internal energy of the cloud approaches zero.\n$$\nU_f = 0\n$$\nAs the gas expands, its initial internal energy is converted into kinetic energy of the bulk motion of the gas. Let the final total kinetic energy be $K_f$. The total final energy of the system is:\n$$\nE_{total, f} = U_f + K_f = 0 + K_f = K_f\n$$\n\n**5. Application of Energy Conservation**\nBy equating the initial and final total energies, we can solve for the final kinetic energy, $K_f$.\n$$\nE_{total, i} = E_{total, f}\n$$\n$$\nM c_v T_0 - \\frac{3A M^2}{4\\pi R_0^3} = K_f\n$$\n\n**6.
