This exercise challenges you to move beyond this idealization by considering a gas whose specific heat varies with temperature. By analyzing the flow at very low Mach numbers, you will derive the first-order correction to the temperature relation, providing a deeper insight into how real gas effects modify our foundational models [@problem_id:606953].", "problem": "Consider a perfect gas flowing isentropically through a nozzle. Unlike a calorically perfect gas (with constant specific heats), this gas is calorically imperfect. Its specific heat at constant pressure, $c_p$, is a known quadratic function of the absolute temperature $T$:\n$$\nc_p(T) = a + bT + cT^2\n$$\nwhere $a$, $b$, and $c$ are positive constants. The gas also obeys the perfect gas law, and thus Mayer's relation, $c_p - c_v = R$, holds, where $R$ is the specific gas constant and $c_v$ is the specific heat at constant volume.\n\nThe steady-flow energy equation relates the stagnation enthalpy $h_0$ to the static enthalpy $h$ and the flow velocity $V$ by $h_0 = h + \\frac{1}{2}V^2$. For a differential change, this gives $dh = c_p(T)dT$. The local speed of sound is given by $c_s^2 = \\gamma(T)RT$, where $\\gamma(T) = c_p(T)/c_v(T)$ is the temperature-dependent ratio of specific heats. The Mach number is defined as $M = V/c_s$.\n\nThe relationship between the stagnation temperature $T_0$ and the static temperature $T$ is implicitly defined by the energy equation. Instead of solving for the ratio $T_0/T$ directly, which leads to a complicated expression, analyze its behavior for low Mach numbers.\n\nDerive an expression for the rate of change of the stagnation-to-static temperature ratio, $T_0/T$, with respect to the square of the Mach number, evaluated in the limit as the Mach number approaches zero. Your result should be expressed in terms of the static temperature $T$, the specific gas constant $R$, and the constants $a$, $b$, and $c$.", "solution": "The analysis begins with the steady-flow energy equation, which relates stagnation and static properties for an adiabatic flow:\n$$\nh_0 - h = \\frac{1}{2}V^2\n$$\nHere, $h_0$ is the stagnation enthalpy corresponding to the stagnation temperature $T_0$, and $h$ is the static enthalpy corresponding to the static temperature $T$.
