The water in the channel is initially quiescent with a uniform depth $y_0$. The acceleration due to gravity is $g$.\n\nThe surge propagates with a constant velocity $v_s$. The water behind the surge has a greater depth $y_1$ and a uniform velocity $u_1$.

We will analyze each stage using the principles of mass and momentum conservation for open-channel flow, specifically for a moving hydraulic jump.\n\n**Part 1: Analysis of the Initial Surge**\n\nWe analyze the initial surge by moving to a frame of reference co-moving with the surge at velocity $v_s$. In this frame, the flow is steady.\n- Upstream (in front of the surge): The fluid approaches the jump with velocity $v_s$ and depth $y_0$.\n- Downstream (behind the surge): The fluid moves away from the jump with velocity $(v_s - u_1)$ and depth $y_1$.\n\nThe conservation of mass (continuity equation) for a channel of unit width is:\n$$\nv_s y_0 = (v_s - u_1) y_1\n$$\nThe conservation of momentum equation is:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{2} g y_0^2 - \\frac{1}{2} g y_1^2 = (v_s - u_1)^2 y_1 - v_s^2 y_0\n$$\nUsing the continuity equation, we can write $\\rho Q_{rel} = \\rho v_s y_0 = \\rho(v_s - u_1) y_1$. The momentum equation simplifies to:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{2} g (y_1^2 - y_0^2) = (v_s y_0) v_s - ((v_s-u_1)y_1)(v_s-u_1) = (v_s y_0) u_1\n$$\nFrom continuity, $u_1 = v_s (1 - y_0/y_1)$. Substituting this expression for $u_1$ gives the surge celerity $v_s$:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{2} g (y_1 - y_0)(y_1 + y_0) = v_s^2 y_0 (1 - y_0/y_1) = v_s^2 \\frac{y_0(y_1-y_0)}{y_1}\n$$\n$$\nv_s^2 = g y_1 \\frac{y_1 + y_0}{2 y_0}\n$$\nNow we find an expression for $u_1^2$:\n$$\nu_1^2 = v_s^2 (1 - y_0/y_1)^2 = \\left( g y_1 \\frac{y_1 + y_0}{2 y_0} \\right) \\left( \\frac{y_1 - y_0}{y_1} \\right)^2 = \\frac{g(y_1+y_0)(y_1-y_0)^2}{2 y_0 y_1}\n$$\nThe Froude number of the flow behind the surge is $Fr_1 = u_1/\\sqrt{g y_1}$. Squaring gives:\n$$\nFr_1^2 = \\frac{u_1^2}{g y_1} = \\frac{(y_1+y_0)(y_1-y_0)^2}{2 y_0 y_1^2}\n$$\nLet's introduce the depth ratio $\\eta_1 = y_1/y_0$. The expression for the Froude number becomes:\n$$\nFr_1^2 = \\frac{(y_0 \\eta_1 + y_0)(y_0 \\eta_1 - y_0)^2}{2 y_0 (y_0 \\eta_1)^2} = \\frac{y_0^3(\\eta_1+1)(\\eta_1-1)^2}{2 y_0^3 \\eta_1^2} = \\frac{(\\eta_1+1)(\\eta_1-1)^2}{2\\eta_1^2}\n$$\nWe are given $Fr_1^2 = 3/8$. We can solve for $\\eta_1$:\n$$\n\\frac{3}{8} = \\frac{(\\eta_1+1)(\\eta_1-1)^2}{2\\eta_1^2}\n$$\n$$\n6\\eta_1^2 = 8(\\eta_1+1)(\\eta_1^2 - 2\\eta_1 + 1) = 8(\\eta_1^3 - 2\\eta_1^2 + \\eta_1 + \\eta_1^2 - 2\\eta_1 + 1) = 8(\\eta_1^3 - \\eta_1^2 - \\eta_1 + 1)\n$$\n$$\n3\\eta_1^2 = 4\\eta_1^3 - 4\\eta_1^2 - 4\\eta_1 + 4\n$$\n$$\n4\\eta_1^3 - 7\\eta_1^2 - 4\\eta_1 + 4 = 0\n$$\nFor a positive surge, we must have $y_1 > y_0$, so $\\eta_1 > 1$. We test for rational roots $p/q$, where $p$ divides 4 and $q$ divides 4. Let's test $\\eta_1 = 2$:\n$$\n4(2)^3 - 7(2)^2 - 4(2) + 4 = 4(8) - 7(4) - 8 + 4 = 32 - 28 - 8 + 4 = 0\n$$\nThus, $\\eta_1=2$ is a root. Factoring out $(\\eta_1-2)$, we get $(\\eta_1-2)(4\\eta_1^2 + \\eta_1 - 2) = 0$. The other roots are $\\eta_1 = \\frac{-1 \\pm \\sqrt{1-4(4)(-2)}}{8} = \\frac{-1 \\pm \\sqrt{33}}{8}$. Neither of these roots is greater than 1. Therefore, the only physically valid solution is $\\eta_1 = 2$.\n\n**Part 2: Analysis of the Reflected Surge**\nThe reflected surge propagates into a flow of depth $y_1 = 2y_0$ and velocity $u_1$. The flow behind the reflected surge is at rest ($u_f=0$) with depth $y_f$. We can analyze this as a hydraulic jump in a frame moving with the reflected surge. A more direct approach is to equate the two different expressions for the velocity $u_1$.\n\nWe have one expression for $u_1^2$ from the initial surge. Now we derive a second expression for $u_1^2$ from the properties of the reflected surge. For a surge propagating against a flow, bringing it to rest, the momentum equation yields:\n$$\nu_1^2 = \\frac{g(y_1+y_f)(y_f-y_1)^2}{2 y_1 y_f}\n$$\nNow we equate the two expressions for $u_1^2$:\n$$\n\\frac{g(y_1+y_0)(y_1-y_0)^2}{2 y_0 y_1} = \\frac{g(y_1+y_f)(y_f-y_1)^2}{2 y_1 y_f}\n$$\nCanceling common terms gives:\n$$\n\\frac{(y_1+y_0)(y_1-y_0)^2}{y_0} = \\frac{(y_1+y_f)(y_f-y_1)^2}{y_f}\n$$\nNow, we introduce the depth ratios $\\eta_1 = y_1/y_0$ and $\\eta_f = y_f/y_0$.\n$$\n\\frac{(y_0\\eta_1+y_0)(y_0\\eta_1-y_0)^2}{y_0} = \\frac{(y_0\\eta_1+y_0\\eta_f)(y_0\\eta_f-y_0\\eta_1)^2}{y_0\\eta_f}\n$$\n$$\ny_0^2(\\eta_1+1)(\\eta_1-1)^2 = \\frac{y_0^3(\\eta_1+\\eta_f)(\\eta_f-\\eta_1)^2}{y_0\\eta_f}\n$$\n$$\n(\\eta_1+1)(\\eta_1-1)^2 = \\frac{(\\eta_1+\\eta_f)(\\eta_f-\\eta_1)^2}{\\eta_f}\n$$\nNow we substitute the value $\\eta_1=2$:\n$$\n(2+1)(2-1)^2 = \\frac{(2+\\eta_f)(\\eta_f-2)^2}{\\eta_f}\n$$\n$$\n3 = \\frac{(\\eta_f+2)(\\eta_f-2)^2}{\\eta_f}\n$$\n$$\n3\\eta_f = (\\eta_f+2)(\\eta_f^2 - 4\\eta_f + 4) = \\eta_f^3 - 4\\eta_f^2 + 4\\eta_f + 2\\eta_f^2 - 8\\eta_f + 8\n$$\n$$\n3\\eta_f = \\eta_f^3 - 2\\eta_f^2 - 4\\eta_f + 8\n$$\n$$\n\\eta_f^3 - 2\\eta_f^2 - 7\\eta_f + 8 = 0\n$$\nThe water depth must increase upon reflection, so we seek a root $\\eta_f > \\eta_1 = 2$. Let's test for rational roots (divisors of 8): $\\pm 1, \\pm 2, \\pm 4, \\pm 8$.\nTesting $\\eta_f = 1$: $1 - 2 - 7 + 8 = 0$. So $\\eta_f=1$ is a root. We can factor $(\\eta_f-1)$ out.\n$$\n(\\eta_f-1)(\\eta_f^2 - \\eta_f - 8) = \\eta_f^3 - \\eta_f^2 - 8\\eta_f - \\eta_f^2 + \\eta_f + 8 = \\eta_f^3 - 2\\eta_f^2 - 7\\eta_f + 8\n$$\nThe roots are $\\eta_f=1$ and the roots of the quadratic $\\eta_f^2 - \\eta_f - 8 = 0$. The root $\\eta_f=1$ corresponds to a trivial case ($y_f=y_0$) and is not the physical solution since depth must increase. The physical solution comes from the quadratic formula:\n$$\n\\eta_f = \\frac{-(-1) \\pm \\sqrt{(-1)^2 - 4(1)(-8)}}{2(1)} = \\frac{1 \\pm \\sqrt{1 + 32}}{2} = \\frac{1 \\pm \\sqrt{33}}{2}\n$$\nSince $\\eta_f = y_f/y_0$ must be positive, we take the positive root.\n$$\n\\eta_f = \\frac{1 + \\sqrt{33}}{2}\n$$\nLet's check if this satisfies $\\eta_f > 2$. $\\sqrt{33}$ is between $\\sqrt{25}=5$ and $\\sqrt{36}=6$. So $\\eta_f \\approx (1+5.74)/2 \\approx 3.37$, which is greater than 2. This is the physical solution.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\frac{1 + \\sqrt{33}}{2}}\n$$", "id": "614222"}, {"introduction": "The classic textbook hydraulic jump assumes an adiabatic process where mechanical energy is lost but no heat is exchanged.

The channel bed between sections 1 and 2 is heated, causing a total amount of heat to be added to the fluid as it passes through the jump.
