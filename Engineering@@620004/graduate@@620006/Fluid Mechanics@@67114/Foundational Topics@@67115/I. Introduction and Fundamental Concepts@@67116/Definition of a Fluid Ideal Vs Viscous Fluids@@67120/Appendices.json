In a real, viscous fluid flowing through a pipe, friction with the walls and between layers creates a characteristic parabolic velocity profile, with the fluid moving fastest at the center and being stationary at the walls. This practice challenges you to quantify the impact of this profile by comparing it to the hypothetical uniform 'plug flow' of an ideal fluid [@problem_id:482275].

The fluid has a constant density $\\rho$. Due to viscous effects at the pipe wall, a parabolic velocity profile is established, which is characteristic of Hagen-Poiseuille flow. The axial velocity $u$ at a radial distance $r$ from the pipe's centerline is given by:\n$$u_{viscous}(r) = u_{max} \\left(1 - \\frac{r^2}{R^2}\\right)$$\nwhere $u_{max}$ is the maximum velocity at the centerline ($r=0$).\n\nNow, consider a hypothetical flow of an ideal (inviscid) fluid through the same pipe. In this case, the velocity profile is uniform across the pipe's cross-section.
