The model consists of particles with unit mass ($m=1$) moving on a two-dimensional square lattice. Time progresses in discrete steps. At each time step, every particle moves with unit speed ($c=1$) to a neighboring lattice site. The velocity of a particle is restricted to one of the four directions connecting a site to its nearest neighbors. We denote these velocity vectors as $\\mathbf{c}_i$, for $i \\in \\{1, 2, 3, 4\\}$, corresponding to East, North, West, and South directions respectively.\n\nThe state of any lattice site $\\mathbf{x}$ at time $t$ is described by a set of Boolean occupation numbers $\\{n_i(\\mathbf{x}, t)\\}_{i=1}^4$, where $n_i(\\mathbf{x},t) = 1$ if a particle with velocity $\\mathbf{c}_i$ is present at the site, and $n_i(\\mathbf{x},t) = 0$ otherwise. This implies an exclusion rule: no two particles at the same site can have the same velocity. After moving, particles at the same site undergo a collision that conserves particle number and total momentum.\n\nThe macroscopic fluid density $\\rho$ is the average number of particles per site.
