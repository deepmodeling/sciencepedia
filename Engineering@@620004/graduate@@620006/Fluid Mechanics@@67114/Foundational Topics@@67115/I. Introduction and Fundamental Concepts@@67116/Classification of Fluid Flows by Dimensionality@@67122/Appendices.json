In this model, under the influence of wind stress and the Coriolis effect, the horizontal water velocity vector, $\\vec{V}$, is found to be independent of the horizontal positions $x$ and $y$. The velocity vector has components only in the horizontal plane, but these components, $u$ (Eastward) and $v$ (Northward), vary with the vertical coordinate $z$.
