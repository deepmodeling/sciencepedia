We will analyze a bubble in a rigidly rotating liquid to determine the forces acting on it and derive its terminal migration velocity.

After a long time, the liquid achieves a state of rigid body rotation, where its velocity at a radial distance $r$ from the axis is purely azimuthal, given by $v_\\theta = \\Omega r$.\n\nA small spherical gas bubble of radius $a$ and density $\\rho_g$ is introduced into the rotating liquid at a radial position $r$. The pressure gradient established within the rotating liquid exerts a net force on the bubble, causing it to migrate radially. This motion is opposed by viscous drag from the liquid.\n\nUnder the following assumptions:\n1. The bubble is sufficiently small for its motion relative to the liquid to be in the low Reynolds number regime, where the drag force is described by Stokes' law, $F_D = 6\\pi\\mu a U_{rel}$.\n2. The bubble's radius is much smaller than its radial position ($a \\ll r$), allowing the liquid's pressure gradient to be treated as uniform across the bubble's volume.\n3. The bubble rapidly co-rotates with the liquid, meaning its azimuthal velocity matches that of the surrounding fluid at radius $r$.\n4. The density of the gas within the bubble is negligible compared to the density of the liquid ($\\rho_g \\ll \\rho_l$).\n5. The effects of gravity are aligned with the axis of rotation and thus do not influence the radial dynamics.\n\nDerive an expression for the terminal radial migration velocity, $U_r$, of the bubble at the radial position $r$.
