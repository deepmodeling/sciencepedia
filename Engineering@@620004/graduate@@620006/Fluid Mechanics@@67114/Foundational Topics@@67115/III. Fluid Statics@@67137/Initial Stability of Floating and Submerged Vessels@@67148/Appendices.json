This is the distance from the body's center of gravity ($G$) to its metacenter ($M$). For stable equilibrium, the metacenter must be located above the center of gravity ($GM > 0$).\n\nThe metacenter $M$ is found by considering the locations of the center of buoyancy $B$ (the centroid of the displaced fluid volume) and the metacentric radius $BM$. The metacentric radius is given by the formula $BM = I_w / V_{sub}$, where $V_{sub}$ is the submerged volume of the body and $I_w$ is the second moment of area of the waterplane (the cross-sectional area of the body at the water level) about the axis of rotation. The vertical position of the metacenter, $z_M$, is given by $z_M = z_B + BM$, where $z_B$ is the vertical position of the center of buoyancy. The metacentric height is then $GM = z_M - z_G$, where $z_G$ is the vertical position of the center of gravity.\n\nFor a homogeneous right circular cone of height $H$ with its base on the $z=0$ plane, the center of gravity is located at $z_G = H/4$.\n\n**Problem:**\nA solid, homogeneous right circular cone of height $H$ and base radius $R$ is made of a material with a uniform density $\\rho_c$. It floats in a liquid of density $\\rho_l$. The cone is oriented such that its apex points vertically upwards, and its flat circular base is parallel to the liquid surface. The specific gravity of the cone relative to the liquid is given by $S = \\rho_c/\\rho_l$, with $0  S  1$.\n\nDerive a closed-form analytical expression for the initial metacentric height, $GM$, of the cone. Express your answer in terms of the cone's height $H$, base radius $R$, and the specific gravity $S$.", "solution": "**1. Setup and Equilibrium Condition**\n\nLet's set up a coordinate system with the origin at the center of the cone's base. The z-axis is the axis of symmetry, pointing upwards towards the apex. The base is in the $z=0$ plane, and the apex is at $(0, 0, H)$.\n\nThe total volume of the cone is $V_{total} = \\frac{1}{3}\\pi R^2 H$. The weight of the cone is $W = \\rho_c g V_{total} = S \\rho_l g V_{total}$.\n\nThe cone floats with its apex up, so the submerged part is a frustum of height $h$. Let $h_u = H-h$ be the height of the unsubmerged part, which is a small cone at the top. The volume of this small unsubmerged cone is $V_{top}$. By similar triangles, its radius is $r_{top} = R(h_u/H)$. Thus, its volume is $V_{top} = \\frac{1}{3}\\pi r_{top}^2 h_u = \\frac{1}{3}\\pi (R \\frac{h_u}{H})^2 h_u = V_{total} (\\frac{h_u}{H})^3$.\n\nThe submerged volume is $V_{sub} = V_{total} - V_{top} = V_{total} [1 - (\\frac{h_u}{H})^3]$.\n\nFor flotation equilibrium, the weight of the cone equals the weight of the displaced liquid: $W = F_B$.\n$S \\rho_l g V_{total} = \\rho_l g V_{sub}$\n$S V_{total} = V_{sub} = V_{total} [1 - (\\frac{h_u}{H})^3]$\n$S = 1 - (\\frac{h_u}{H})^3 \\implies (\\frac{h_u}{H})^3 = 1-S \\implies h_u = H(1-S)^{1/3}$.\n\nThe submerged depth is $h = H - h_u = H[1 - (1-S)^{1/3}]$.\n\n**2. Center of Gravity (G)**\n\nFor a homogeneous cone with its base at $z=0$ and apex at $z=H$, the center of gravity is located at a distance of $H/4$ from the base.\n$$z_G = \\frac{H}{4}$$\n\n**3. Center of Buoyancy (B)**\n\nThe center of buoyancy, $z_B$, is the centroid of the submerged volume (the frustum). We can find it by considering the full cone and subtracting the small unsubmerged cone at the top, using the principle of composite bodies: $z_B V_{sub} = z_{G, total} V_{total} - z_{G, top} V_{top}$.\n\n-   $z_{G, total} = H/4$ (CG of the entire cone).\n-   $V_{sub} = S V_{total}$.\n-   $V_{top} = (1-S) V_{total}$.\n-   The unsubmerged cone has height $h_u$ and its apex is at $z=H$. Its CG is located at a distance of $3/4 h_u$ from its apex. Thus, its z-coordinate is $z_{G, top} = H - \\frac{3}{4}h_u$.\n\nSubstituting these into the composite body formula:\n$z_B (S V_{total}) = (\\frac{H}{4}) V_{total} - (H - \\frac{3}{4}h_u) ((1-S)V_{total})$\n$S z_B = \\frac{H}{4} - (H - \\frac{3}{4}h_u)(1-S)$\n$S z_B = \\frac{H}{4} - H + HS + \\frac{3}{4}h_u(1-S)$\n$S z_B = HS - \\frac{3H}{4} + \\frac{3}{4}H(1-S)^{1/3}(1-S)$\n$S z_B = HS - \\frac{3H}{4} + \\frac{3H}{4}(1-S)^{4/3}$\n$$z_B = H - \\frac{3H}{4S} + \\frac{3H}{4S}(1-S)^{4/3} = H - \\frac{3H}{4S}[1 - (1-S)^{4/3}]$$\n\n**4.

Its radius is $r_w = R(1-h/H) = R(h_u/H)$.\nThe second moment of area of this circle is $I_w = \\frac{\\pi r_w^4}{4} = \\frac{\\pi}{4}(\\frac{R h_u}{H})^4$.\n$I_w = \\frac{\\pi R^4}{4H^4} [H(1-S)^{1/3}]^4 = \\frac{\\pi R^4 H^4 (1-S)^{4/3}}{4H^4} = \\frac{\\pi R^4}{4}(1-S)^{4/3}$.\n\nThe submerged volume is $V_{sub} = S V_{total} = S \\frac{1}{3}\\pi R^2 H$.\nSo, the metacentric radius is:\n$$BM = \\frac{\\frac{\\pi R^4}{4}(1-S)^{4/3}}{S \\frac{1}{3}\\pi R^2 H} = \\frac{3 R^2 (1-S)^{4/3}}{4 S H}$$\n\n**5.
