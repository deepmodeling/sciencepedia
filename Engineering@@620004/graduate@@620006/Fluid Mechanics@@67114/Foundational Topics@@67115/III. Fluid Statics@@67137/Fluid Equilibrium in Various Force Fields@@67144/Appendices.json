Let the origin of our coordinate system $(x', y', z')$ be at the center of the sphere. The depth of the center of the sphere from the surface is $h$. A point within the sphere at a vertical position $z'$ relative to the center has an absolute depth from the surface of $z = h + z'$.

Because a sphere is perfectly symmetric about its center, for every volume element $dV$ at a position $z'$, there is an identical volume element at $-z'$. Therefore, the integral of $z'$ over the entire symmetric volume is zero.\n$$\\int_{V_s} z' \\, dV = 0$$\n\nThus, the total buoyant force simplifies to:\n$$F_B = g \\left[ (\\rho_0 + \\beta h) V_s + 0 \\right] = (\\rho_0 + \\beta h) V_s g = (\\rho_0 + \\beta h) \\left(\\frac{4}{3}\\pi R^3\\right) g$$\nThis result shows that the buoyant force on the sphere is equal to the volume of the sphere multiplied by the density of the fluid evaluated at the depth of the sphere's center, all multiplied by $g$.\n\nAt equilibrium, the buoyant force must balance the weight:\n$$F_B = W$$\n$$(\\rho_0 + \\beta h) \\left(\\frac{4}{3}\\pi R^3\\right) g = \\rho_s \\left(\\frac{4}{3}\\pi R^3\\right) g$$\n\nWe can cancel the common term $\\left(\\frac{4}{3}\\pi R^3\\right) g$ from both sides, as it is non-zero.\n$$\\rho_0 + \\beta h = \\rho_s$$\n\nNow, we solve for the equilibrium depth $h$:\n$$\\beta h = \\rho_s - \\rho_0$$\n$$h = \\frac{\\rho_s - \\rho_0}{\\beta}$$\nThis expression gives the depth of the sphere's center when it is in equilibrium, fully submerged in the fluid.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{\\rho_s - \\rho_0}{\\beta}}$$"}, {"introduction": "To solidify our understanding of fluid equilibrium in diverse force fields, this final problem presents a thought experiment involving an isothermal gas in a hypothetical gravitational potential.
