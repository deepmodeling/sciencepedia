This first practice problem explores the pressure field inside a rotating cylinder of liquid, a classic scenario in fluid mechanics. By analyzing this system, you will see how pressure adjusts to balance not only gravity but also the centrifugal force, leading to the characteristic parabolic shape of the free surface. This exercise provides a deeper intuition for how pressure fields are established by body forces in both inertial and non-inertial reference frames.

The entire system is at rest and the pressure at the free surface is the atmospheric pressure, $P_{atm}$. The cylinder is then spun up to a constant angular velocity $\\omega$ about its central vertical axis. The fluid rotates with the cylinder as a rigid body. The system is under the influence of a uniform gravitational field, represented by the acceleration vector $\\vec{g} = -g\\hat{k}$, where $\\hat{k}$ is the unit vector along the vertical axis (z-axis) and the origin is at the center of the cylinder's base.\n\nDue to the rotation, the initially flat free surface of the fluid deforms into a stable paraboloid shape. Assume that the angular velocity $\\omega$ is sufficiently small such that the fluid at the center of the tank does not touch the bottom of the tank (i.e., the minimum height of the fluid is positive).\n\nBy considering the conservation of the fluid volume and the governing equations for fluid pressure in a rotating frame, derive an expression for the gauge pressure at the center of the bottom of the tank, located at coordinates $(r=0, z=0)$.
