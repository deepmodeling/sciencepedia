This first practice problem explores the pressure field inside a rotating cylinder of liquid, a classic scenario in fluid mechanics. By analyzing this system, you will see how pressure adjusts to balance not only gravity but also the centrifugal force, leading to the characteristic parabolic shape of the free surface. This exercise provides a deeper intuition for how pressure fields are established by body forces in both inertial and non-inertial reference frames.
