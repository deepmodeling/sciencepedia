This condition can be found by analyzing the geometry of the capillary surface in the limit of zero gravity ($g=0$). In this limit, the liquid-gas interface forms a surface of constant mean curvature. For a capillary surface in a vertical corner, this simplifies to the horizontal cross-section of the meniscus being a circular arc.\n\nYour task is to derive the critical half-angle of the corner, $\\alpha_{crit}$, beyond which the liquid will no longer rise to an infinite height.
