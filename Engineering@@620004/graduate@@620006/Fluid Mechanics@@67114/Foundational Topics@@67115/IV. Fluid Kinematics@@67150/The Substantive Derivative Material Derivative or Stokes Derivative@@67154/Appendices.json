It is scientifically sound, well-posed, and free of ambiguity. It represents a fundamental exercise in continuum mechanics and is directly relevant to the study of transport phenomena. All required information is provided. We will proceed with the derivation and calculation.\n\nThe material derivative, denoted $D()/Dt$, quantifies the rate of change of a physical property $\\phi$ of a specific material particle as it moves through space and time. The position of such a particle at time $t$ is given by its pathline $\\mathbf{X}(t)$. By definition, the velocity of the particle along its path is the local fluid velocity, $\\dot{\\mathbf{X}}(t) = \\mathbf{v}(\\mathbf{X}(t), t)$. The property $\\phi$ evaluated for this specific particle is therefore a composite function of time, $\\phi(\\mathbf{X}(t), t)$. The material derivative is the total time derivative of this composite function.\n\nTask 1: Derivation of the Material Derivative\n\nWe are tasked to derive the expression for the material derivative for both a scalar field and a vector field, starting from the application of the multivariable chain rule to the composite mapping $t \\mapsto \\phi(\\mathbf{X}(t), t)$. We operate in a Cartesian coordinate system where the basis vectors are constant. Let the spatial coordinates be $\\mathbf{x} = (x_1, x_2, x_3)$ and the particle path be $\\mathbf{X}(t) = (X_1(t), X_2(t), X_3(t))$.\n\nDerivation for a scalar field $f(\\mathbf{x}, t)$:\nThe scalar field experienced by the moving particle is $f(\\mathbf{X}(t), t) = f(X_1(t), X_2(t), X_3(t), t)$.\nBy definition, the material derivative is\n$$\n\\frac{D f}{D t} \\equiv \\frac{d}{dt} \\left[ f(\\mathbf{X}(t), t) \\right]\n$$\nApplying the chain rule for a function of four variables ($X_1, X_2, X_3, t$), we obtain:\n$$\n\\frac{D f}{D t} = \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial X_1} \\frac{d X_1}{d t} + \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial X_2} \\frac{d X_2}{d t} + \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial X_3} \\frac{d X_3}{d t} + \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial t} \\frac{d t}{d t}\n$$\nThe derivatives are evaluated at the particle's position $(\\mathbf{X}(t), t)$. We recognize that $\\frac{dt}{dt} = 1$. The term $\\frac{dX_i}{dt}$ is the $i$-th component of the particle's velocity, which is given by the fluid velocity field $\\mathbf{v}$ at the particle's location. Let $\\mathbf{v} = (v_1, v_2, v_3)$. Then, $\\frac{dX_i}{dt} = v_i(\\mathbf{X}(t), t)$.\nSubstituting these into the expression gives:\n$$\n\\frac{D f}{D t} = v_1 \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial X_1} + v_2 \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial X_2} + v_3 \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial X_3} + \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial t}\n$$\nThis expression is typically evaluated at an arbitrary point $(\\mathbf{x},t)$ in the field, not just along a specific path. We thus replace $\\mathbf{X}$ with the general position vector $\\mathbf{x}$:\n$$\n\\frac{D f}{D t} = \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial t} + v_1 \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x_1} + v_2 \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x_2} + v_3 \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x_3}\n$$\nThe summation can be written compactly using vector notation. The gradient of the scalar field $f$ is $\\nabla f = \\left(\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x_1}, \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x_2}, \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x_3}\\right)$. The sum is therefore the dot product $\\mathbf{v} \\cdot \\nabla f$.\nThe final expression for the material derivative of a scalar field is:\n$$\n\\frac{D f}{D t} = \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial t} + \\mathbf{v} \\cdot \\nabla f\n$$\nThe operator $\\mathbf{v} \\cdot \\nabla$ is the convective derivative, representing the change in $f$ due to the particle moving to a new location with a different value of $f$. The term $\\partial f / \\partial t$ is the local or partial time derivative, representing the change in $f$ at a fixed point in space.\n\nDerivation for a vector field $\\mathbf{u}(\\mathbf{x}, t)$:\nA vector field in Cartesian coordinates can be expressed as $\\mathbf{u} = u_1 \\hat{\\mathbf{e}}_1 + u_2 \\hat{\\mathbf{e}}_2 + u_3 \\hat{\\mathbf{e}}_3$, where $u_i(\\mathbf{x}, t)$ are scalar component fields and $\\hat{\\mathbf{e}}_i$ are constant basis vectors. The material derivative of the vector $\\mathbf{u}$ is the vector whose components are the material derivatives of the scalar components $u_i$:\n$$\n\\frac{D \\mathbf{u}}{D t} = \\frac{D u_1}{D t} \\hat{\\mathbf{e}}_1 + \\frac{D u_2}{D t} \\hat{\\mathbf{e}}_2 + \\frac{D u_3}{D t} \\hat{\\mathbf{e}}_3\n$$\nWe apply the previously derived formula for a scalar field to each component $u_i$:\n$$\n\\frac{D u_i}{D t} = \\frac{\\partial u_i}{\\partial t} + \\mathbf{v} \\cdot \\nabla u_i\n$$\nSubstituting this back into the vector expression:\n$$\n\\frac{D \\mathbf{u}}{D t} = \\left(\\frac{\\partial u_1}{\\partial t} + \\mathbf{v} \\cdot \\nabla u_1\\right) \\hat{\\mathbf{e}}_1 + \\left(\\frac{\\partial u_2}{\\partial t} + \\mathbf{v} \\cdot \\nabla u_2\\right) \\hat{\\mathbf{e}}_2 + \\left(\\frac{\\partial u_3}{\\partial t} + \\mathbf{v} \\cdot \\nabla u_3\\right) \\hat{\\mathbf{e}}_3\n$$\nThis can be separated into two vector terms:\n$$\n\\frac{D \\mathbf{u}}{D t} = \\left(\\frac{\\partial u_1}{\\partial t}\\hat{\\mathbf{e}}_1 + \\frac{\\partial u_2}{\\partial t}\\hat{\\mathbf{e}}_2 + \\frac{\\partial u_3}{\\partial t}\\hat{\\mathbf{e}}_3\\right) + \\left((\\mathbf{v} \\cdot \\nabla u_1)\\hat{\\mathbf{e}}_1 + (\\mathbf{v} \\cdot \\nabla u_2)\\hat{\\mathbf{e}}_2 + (\\mathbf{v} \\cdot \\nabla u_3)\\hat{\\mathbf{e}}_3\\right)\n$$\nThe first term is the partial time derivative of the vector field, $\\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{u}}{\\partial t}$. The second term is defined as the convective derivative of the vector field, $(\\mathbf{v} \\cdot \\nabla)\\mathbf{u}$. Thus, the material derivative of a vector field is:\n$$\n\\frac{D \\mathbf{u}}{D t} = \\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{u}}{\\partial t} + (\\mathbf{v} \\cdot \\nabla) \\mathbf{u}\n$$\nThis completes the derivation for both cases as required by Task 1.\n\nTask 2: Computation for a Specific Case\n\nWe are given the planar linear straining flow with velocity field $\\mathbf{v}(x,y,t) = (a x, -a y, 0)$ and the scalar field $f(x,y,t) = x^{2}y + t$. We must compute the material derivative $Df/Dt$.\n\nWe use the formula derived in Task 1 for a scalar field:\n$$\n\\frac{D f}{D t} = \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial t} + \\mathbf{v} \\cdot \\nabla f\n$$\nWe compute each term separately.\nFirst, the local time derivative of $f$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial t} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t}(x^{2}y + t) = 1\n$$\nNext, we compute the gradient of $f$:\n$$\n\\nabla f = \\left( \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x}, \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y}, \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial z} \\right)\n$$\nThe components are:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}(x^{2}y + t) = 2xy\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}(x^{2}y + t) = x^{2}\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial z} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z}(x^{2}y + t) = 0\n$$\nSo, the gradient is $\\nabla f = (2xy, x^{2}, 0)$.\n\nNow, we compute the convective term, $\\mathbf{v} \\cdot \\nabla f$:\n$$\n\\mathbf{v} \\cdot \\nabla f = (ax, -ay, 0) \\cdot (2xy, x^{2}, 0)\n$$\n$$\n\\mathbf{v} \\cdot \\nabla f = (ax)(2xy) + (-ay)(x^{2}) + (0)(0)\n$$\n$$\n\\mathbf{v} \\cdot \\nabla f = 2ax^{2}y - ax^{2}y = ax^{2}y\n$$\nFinally, we combine the local and convective terms to find the material derivative:\n$$\n\\frac{D f}{D t} = \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial t} + \\mathbf{v} \\cdot \\nabla f = 1 + ax^{2}y\n$$\nThis is the closed-form expression for the material derivative of the given scalar field in the given velocity field.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{1 + a x^{2} y}\n$$", "id": "2491266"}, {"introduction": "How can fluid particles accelerate in a 'steady' flow, where the velocity at any fixed point is constant?
