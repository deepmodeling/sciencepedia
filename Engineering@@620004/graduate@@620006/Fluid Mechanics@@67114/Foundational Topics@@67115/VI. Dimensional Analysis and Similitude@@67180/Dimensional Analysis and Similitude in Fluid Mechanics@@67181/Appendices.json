This exercise explores the famous Stokes' paradox for 2D flow around a cylinder, where a straightforward scaling argument fails to produce a physically meaningful result. By considering the different physical balances in the near-body and far-field regions, you will uncover the subtle logarithmic dependence of drag at low Reynolds numbers, a signature of problems with widely separated scales [@problem_id:487400].", "id": "487400", "problem": "The drag on a body in a moving fluid is a fundamental problem in fluid mechanics. For a three-dimensional sphere at very low speeds, the drag force is given by Stokes' law, which can be derived from the Stokes equations (the Navier-Stokes equations stripped of their inertial term). A simple dimensional analysis, assuming the drag force $F_D$ depends only on the freestream velocity $U$, sphere diameter $D$, and fluid viscosity $\\mu$, correctly predicts this result.\n\nHowever, for a two-dimensional cylinder, this approach fails. The attempt to solve the 2D Stokes equations for flow past a cylinder leads to a mathematical inconsistency known as Stokes' paradox: no solution exists that can simultaneously satisfy the no-slip boundary condition on the cylinder surface and the freestream velocity condition far away.\n\nThe paradox is resolved by recognizing that the inertial term in the Navier-Stokes equations, $\\rho (\\mathbf{u} \\cdot \\nabla) \\mathbf{u}$, while negligible near the cylinder (the \"inner region\" of size $D$), is not negligible far from it (the \"outer region\").

The derived expression may include a dimensionless prefactor of order unity that depends on the specific geometry of the stroke, which you should represent with a generic constant $C$.\n\n", "solution": "**1. Framework and Governing Equations**\n\nThe problem asks for the swimming velocity $U_{swim}$ of a body performing a reciprocal stroke at low Reynolds numbers. The velocity of the swimmer, $\\mathbf{v}_{body}(t)$, is determined by the constraint that the total hydrodynamic force on it is zero at all times.\n$$\n\\mathbf{F}_{hydro} (t) = 0\n$$\nThis force is the integral of the stress tensor over the body's surface. In the limit of zero Reynolds number (Stokes flow), the force is a linear function of the body's velocity $\\mathbf{v}_{body}$ and its shape deformation rate, which we can characterize by a surface velocity scale $V_s \\sim A\\omega$. For a reciprocal stroke, the scallop theorem correctly predicts that the time-averaged body velocity is zero: $\\langle \\mathbf{v}_{body} \\rangle_t = U_{swim} = 0$.\n\nTo obtain a non-zero swimming velocity, we must consider the inertial effects, which are represented by the term $\\rho (\\partial_t \\mathbf{u} + (\\mathbf{u} \\cdot \\nabla)\\mathbf{u})$ in the Navier-Stokes equations. We treat this as a small perturbation to the Stokes flow.\n\n**2. Perturbation Approach**\n\nWe can use a regular perturbation expansion in the small Reynolds numbers. The net swimming velocity will be the time-average of the first-order correction to the body's velocity. The correction to the Stokes force, $\\mathbf{F}_{inertial}$, arises from the inertial terms. The zero-force condition becomes:\n$$\n\\mathbf{F}_{Stokes} + \\mathbf{F}_{inertial} = 0\n$$\nThe Stokes force on the body can be approximated as $\\mathbf{F}_{Stokes} \\approx -\\mathbf{K} \\cdot \\mathbf{v}_{body} - \\mathbf{F}_{shape}$, where $\\mathbf{K}$ is the resistance tensor (scaling as $\\mu L$) and $\\mathbf{F}_{shape}$ is the force generated by the shape changes if the body were held stationary. The body's velocity is then given by $\\mathbf{v}_{body} \\approx \\mathbf{K}^{-1} (\\mathbf{F}_{inertial} - \\mathbf{F}_{shape})$.\n\nAveraging over a cycle, the contribution from $\\mathbf{F}_{shape}$ vanishes for a reciprocal stroke (this is the essence of the scallop theorem). Thus, the net swimming velocity is:\n$$\nU_{swim} = |\\langle\\mathbf{v}_{body}\\rangle_t| \\approx |\\langle \\mathbf{K}^{-1} \\mathbf{F}_{inertial} \\rangle_t|\n$$\nThe resistance tensor $\\mathbf{K}$ depends on the instantaneous shape of the swimmer. Since the shape changes are small ($A \\ll L$), we can approximate $\\mathbf{K}$ by its value for the mean shape, $\\mathbf{K}_0$, which scales as $\\mu L$.\n$$\nU_{swim} \\sim \\frac{1}{\\mu L} |\\langle \\mathbf{F}_{inertial} \\rangle_t|\n$$\n\n**3. Scaling of the Inertial Force**\n\nThe inertial force $\\mathbf{F}_{inertial}$ is the force exerted on the body by the flow field generated by the inertial \"body force density\" $\\mathbf{f}_{inertial} = \\rho (\\partial_t \\mathbf{u}_0 + (\\mathbf{u}_0 \\cdot \\nabla)\\mathbf{u}_0)$, where $\\mathbf{u}_0$ is the zeroth-order (Stokes) velocity field.\n\nLet's compare the two components of the inertial term: the unsteady term and the convective term.\nThe characteristic velocity of the fluid set in motion by the stroke is of the order of the surface velocity, so $|\\mathbf{u}_0| \\sim V_s = A\\omega$.\n- Unsteady term: $|\\rho \\partial_t \\mathbf{u}_0| \\sim \\rho \\omega |\\mathbf{u}_0| \\sim \\rho A \\omega^2$.\n- Convective term: $|\\rho (\\mathbf{u}_0 \\cdot \\nabla)\\mathbf{u}_0| \\sim \\rho |\\mathbf{u}_0|^2 / L \\sim \\rho (A\\omega)^2 / L$.\n\nThe ratio of their magnitudes is:\n$$\n\\frac{|\\text{unsteady}|}{|\\text{convective}|} \\sim \\frac{\\rho A \\omega^2}{\\rho A^2 \\omega^2 / L} = \\frac{L}{A}\n$$\nSince the stroke amplitude is small ($A \\ll L$), the unsteady term $\\rho \\partial_t \\mathbf{u}_0$ is the dominant contribution to the inertial effects.\n\n**4. The Lorentz Reciprocal Theorem**\n\nTo find the force $\\mathbf{F}_{inertial}$ on the stationary body due to the body force density $\\mathbf{f}_{inertial}$, we use the Lorentz reciprocal theorem. The component of this force in a direction $\\hat{\\mathbf{e}}$ is given by:\n$$\n\\mathbf{F}_{inertial} \\cdot \\hat{\\mathbf{e}} = - \\int_V \\mathbf{f}_{inertial} \\cdot \\hat{\\mathbf{u}} \\, dV\n$$\nwhere $\\hat{\\mathbf{u}}$ is an auxiliary (adjoint) Stokes flow field corresponding to the rigid motion of the body in the direction $\\hat{\\mathbf{e}}$ with unit velocity in an unbounded fluid, and $V$ is the volume of the fluid. We are interested in the time-average of this force, focusing on the dominant unsteady term:\n$$\n\\langle \\mathbf{F}_{inertial} \\cdot \\hat{\\mathbf{e}} \\rangle_t \\approx - \\left\\langle \\int_V \\rho (\\partial_t \\mathbf{u}_0) \\cdot \\hat{\\mathbf{u}} \\, dV \\right\\rangle_t\n$$\nIntegrating by parts with respect to time over one period $T=2\\pi/\\omega$:\n$$\n\\int_0^T (\\partial_t \\mathbf{u}_0) \\cdot \\hat{\\mathbf{u}} \\, dt = [\\mathbf{u}_0 \\cdot \\hat{\\mathbf{u}}]_0^T - \\int_0^T \\mathbf{u}_0 \\cdot (\\partial_t \\hat{\\mathbf{u}}) \\, dt = - \\int_0^T \\mathbf{u}_0 \\cdot (\\partial_t \\hat{\\mathbf{u}}) \\, dt\n$$\nThe boundary term vanishes due to periodicity. The cycle-averaged force is therefore:\n$$\n\\langle \\mathbf{F}_{inertial} \\cdot \\hat{\\mathbf{e}} \\rangle_t \\approx \\frac{\\rho}{T} \\int_0^T \\int_V \\mathbf{u}_0 \\cdot (\\partial_t \\hat{\\mathbf{u}}) \\, dV dt\n$$\n\n**5. Scaling of the Cycle-Averaged Force**\n\nNow we determine the scaling of this integral.\n- The primary velocity field $\\mathbf{u}_0$ is driven by the surface deformation, so its magnitude scales with the surface velocity: $|\\mathbf{u}_0| \\sim A\\omega$.\n- The adjoint field $\\hat{\\mathbf{u}}$ is the Stokes flow around the body with its instantaneous shape. For small deformations, we can expand it around the mean shape: $\\hat{\\mathbf{u}}(t) = \\hat{\\mathbf{u}}(\\text{mean shape}) + \\delta \\hat{\\mathbf{u}}(t)$. The perturbation $\\delta \\hat{\\mathbf{u}}(t)$ is proportional to the deformation amplitude $A$. So, $|\\delta \\hat{\\mathbf{u}}| \\sim (A/L) |\\hat{\\mathbf{u}}| \\sim A/L$ (since $|\\hat{\\mathbf{u}}|\\sim 1$).\n- The time derivative is thus $|\\partial_t \\hat{\\mathbf{u}}| \\sim \\omega |\\delta \\hat{\\mathbf{u}}| \\sim \\omega A/L$.\n- The volume of integration scales as $L^3$.\n\nCombining these, the magnitude of the cycle-averaged force scales as:\n$$\n|\\langle \\mathbf{F}_{inertial} \\rangle_t| \\sim \\rho \\cdot |\\mathbf{u}_0| \\cdot |\\partial_t \\hat{\\mathbf{u}}| \\cdot L^3 \\sim \\rho \\cdot (A\\omega) \\cdot \\left(\\frac{A\\omega}{L}\\right) \\cdot L^3 = \\rho A^2 \\omega^2 L^2\n$$\n\n**6. Final Scaling for Swimming Velocity**\n\nFinally, we substitute this force scaling back into our expression for the swimming velocity:\n$$\nU_{swim} \\sim \\frac{1}{\\mu L} |\\langle \\mathbf{F}_{inertial} \\rangle_t| \\sim \\frac{1}{\\mu L} (\\rho A^2 \\omega^2 L^2) = \\frac{\\rho A^2 \\omega^2 L}{\\mu}\n$$\nIntroducing a dimensionless constant of proportionality $C$ to account for the specific geometry of the swimmer and its stroke, we arrive at the final scaling law:\n$$\nU_{swim} = C \\frac{\\rho A^2 \\omega^2 L}{\\mu}\n$$", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{C \\frac{\\rho A^2 \\omega^2 L}{\\mu}} $$"}]}
