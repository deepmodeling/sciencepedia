The behavior of this system can be described by several physical parameters: the terminal velocity $V_T$, a characteristic size of the bubble (e.g., its equivalent spherical radius) $R$, the density of the liquid $\\rho_l$, the dynamic viscosity of the liquid $\\mu_l$, the acceleration due to gravity $g$, and the surface tension at the gas-liquid interface $\\sigma$.\n\nFor bubbles that are sufficiently large and rising at a high Reynolds number, the flow is dominated by a balance between the buoyancy force and the inertial drag force. Viscous and surface tension effects can be neglected. The buoyancy force is proportional to the volume of displaced liquid and gravity, $F_B \\propto \\rho_l g R^3$. The inertial drag force is proportional to the dynamic pressure and the cross-sectional area, $F_D \\propto \\rho_l V_T^2 R^2$.\n\nBased on the principle of dynamic similarity, the relationship between the governing parameters can be expressed through a dimensionless group. By first identifying the minimal set of physical parameters that govern the terminal velocity in this specific regime (large-size, high-Re), derive the unique dimensionless group $\\Pi$, known as the Froude number, which relates these parameters.
