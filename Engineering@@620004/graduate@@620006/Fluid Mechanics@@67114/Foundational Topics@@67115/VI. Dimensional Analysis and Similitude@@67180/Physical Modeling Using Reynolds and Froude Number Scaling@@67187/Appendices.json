For such turbines, which often operate with a free surface at their outlet (e.g., the tailrace), it is critical to maintain Froude number similarity between the model (subscript $m$) and the prototype (subscript $p$) to ensure that gravitational and inertial forces are correctly scaled. This is expressed as $Fr_m = Fr_p$, where the Froude number is defined as $Fr = V/\\sqrt{gL}$, with $V$ being a characteristic velocity, $L$ a characteristic length, and $g$ the acceleration due to gravity.\n\nA consequence of enforcing Froude similarity is that Reynolds number similarity ($Re_m = Re_p$) is not simultaneously achieved, where $Re = \\rho V L / \\mu$ with $\\rho$ as fluid density and $\\mu$ as dynamic viscosity. This mismatch in Reynolds numbers affects the hydraulic efficiency, $\\eta_h$, because frictional losses are Reynolds-number dependent.\n\nThe total hydraulic loss, expressed as a fraction $\\delta$ of the available head, is related to the efficiency by $\\eta_h = 1 - \\delta$.
