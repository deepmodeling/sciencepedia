The mean velocity is $U = U_{max}/2$.\n\nThe concentration of the solute, $C(t, x, r)$, is governed by the advection-diffusion equation.

A quasi-steady state is reached in the radial direction, where the radial diffusive flux balances the effects of differential advection. This leads to a concentration profile where the radial variation, $C' = C - C_m$, is proportional to the local axial gradient of the cross-sectionally averaged concentration, $\\frac{\\partial C_m}{\\partial x'}$.
