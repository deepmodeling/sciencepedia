However, this is an empirical approximation that breaks down for flows in micro/nano-scale geometries or for rarefied gases. A more general model is the Navier slip boundary condition, which allows for a finite fluid velocity at the surface, known as the slip velocity.\n\nThis problem asks for the derivation of the slip length, a key parameter in the Navier slip model, from a simplified momentum balance in a thin fluid layer near a solid wall.\n\n**Problem Statement:**\n\nConsider a steady, one-dimensional flow of an incompressible Newtonian fluid in the $x$-direction over a stationary flat plate located at the plane $y=0$. The fluid has a constant dynamic viscosity $\\mu$. The velocity profile is denoted by $u(y)$. We analyze the system using a thin-layer model with the following physical assumptions:\n\n1.  At the heart of the analysis is a momentum balance on an infinitesimally thin fluid layer of thickness $\\delta$ (spanning from $y=0$ to $y=\\delta$). For steady flow with negligible inertial and pressure-gradient effects within this thin layer, the shear stress exerted by the bulk fluid on the top of the layer (at $y=\\delta$) must be exactly balanced by the frictional shear stress exerted by the wall on the bottom of the layer (at $y=0$). This balance is expressed as $\\tau_w = \\tau_{yx}|_{y=\\delta}$.\n\n2.  The shear stress at the interface between the thin layer and the bulk fluid is described by Newton's law of viscosity:\n    $$ \\tau_{yx}|_{y=\\delta} = \\mu \\left. \\frac{du}{dy} \\right|_{y=\\delta} $$\n\n3.  The frictional drag per unit area, $\\tau_w$, exerted by the stationary wall on the fluid is modeled as being directly proportional to the slip velocity, $u_s \\equiv u(0)$. This relationship is given by:\n    $$ \\tau_w = \\beta u_s $$\n    where $\\beta$ is a phenomenological friction coefficient that depends on the specific fluid-solid interaction.\n\n4.  As the layer thickness $\\delta$ is considered negligible compared to the characteristic length scales of the bulk flow, the velocity gradient is assumed to be continuous across the boundary at $y=\\delta$. This allows for the approximation:\n    $$ \\left. \\frac{du}{dy} \\right|_{y=\\delta} \\approx \\left. \\frac{du}{dy} \\right|_{y=0} $$\n\nUsing these assumptions, derive an expression for the **slip length**, $L_s$. The slip length is the proportionality constant in the linear Navier slip boundary condition, which is defined as:\n$$ u_s = L_s \\left. \\frac{du}{dy} \\right|_{y=0} $$\nYour final expression for $L_s$ should be in terms of the dynamic viscosity $\\mu$ and the friction coefficient $\\beta$.", "solution": "1.
