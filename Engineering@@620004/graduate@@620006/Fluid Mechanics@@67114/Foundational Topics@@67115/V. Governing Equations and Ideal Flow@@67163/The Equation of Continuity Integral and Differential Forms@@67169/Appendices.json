The task is to evaluate several statements regarding the application of conservation laws across this discontinuity.\n\n### Derivation from First Principles\n\nIn a steady flow, the integral forms of the conservation laws for a control volume (CV) are:\n1.  **Conservation of Mass**: $\\oint_{\\partial V} \\rho \\mathbf{u} \\cdot d\\mathbf{A} = 0$\n2.  **Conservation of Momentum**: $\\sum \\mathbf{F}_{ext} = \\oint_{\\partial V} (\\rho \\mathbf{u}) (\\mathbf{u} \\cdot d\\mathbf{A})$\n\nWe apply these to a control volume that encloses the hydraulic jump, with its inlet at section $1$ (upstream) and outlet at section $2$ (downstream). The channel has unit width, so the flow cross-sectional area at any section with depth $h$ is $A = h \\times 1 = h$.\n\n**Mass Balance:**\nFor steady flow, the net mass flux across the CV boundary is zero. Flow enters at section $1$ and exits at section $2$.\n$$-\\rho u_1 A_1 + \\rho u_2 A_2 = 0$$\nGiven the fluid is incompressible ($\\rho = \\text{const}$) and the channel has unit width ($A_1 = h_1$, $A_2 = h_2$):\n$$-\\rho u_1 h_1 + \\rho u_2 h_2 = 0 \\implies u_1 h_1 = u_2 h_2$$\nThe quantity $q = uh$ is the constant volumetric flow rate per unit width.\n\n**Momentum Balance:**\nWe consider the momentum balance in the streamwise (horizontal) direction. The sum of external forces equals the net rate of momentum outflow.\n$$\\sum F_x = (\\text{Momentum flux out}) - (\\text{Momentum flux in})$$\nExternal forces, $\\sum F_x$, consist only of pressure forces on the inlet and outlet faces of the CV, as friction and bed slope effects are neglected. The pressure is assumed hydrostatic at these sections. The pressure force on a vertical face of unit width is given by:\n$$F_p = \\int_0^h p(z) dz = \\int_0^h \\rho g (h-z) dz = \\frac{1}{2} \\rho g h^2$$\nThe net force on the fluid in the CV is $F_{p,1} - F_{p,2}$.\n$$\\sum F_x = \\frac{1}{2} \\rho g h_1^2 - \\frac{1}{2} \\rho g h_2^2$$\nThe rate of momentum flow across a section is $\\dot{m} u = (\\rho u A) u = \\rho u^2 A$. For unit width, this is $\\rho u^2 h$.\nThe net rate of momentum outflow from the CV is:\n$$(\\rho u_2^2 h_2) - (\\rho u_1^2 h_1)$$\nEquating forces and the change in momentum flux:\n$$\\frac{1}{2} \\rho g h_1^2 - \\frac{1}{2} \\rho g h_2^2 = \\rho u_2^2 h_2 - \\rho u_1^2 h_1$$\nRearranging this equation gives the standard momentum balance relation, which states that the specific force is conserved across the jump:\n$$\\rho u_1^2 h_1 + \\frac{1}{2} \\rho g h_1^2 = \\rho u_2^2 h_2 + \\frac{1}{2} \\rho g h_2^2$$\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. The correct mass balance across a steady, stationary hydraulic jump in a unit-width channel is obtained by applying the integral form over a vanishingly thin control volume across the jump, yielding $h_1 u_1 = h_2 u_2$.**\nThe derivation from the integral form of mass conservation for an incompressible fluid yields precisely $u_1 h_1 = u_2 h_2$. This equation represents the conservation of volumetric flow rate per unit width ($q$). The method described, applying the integral form over a control volume that straddles the discontinuity, is the correct procedure for obtaining jump conditions.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. The correct streamwise momentum balance across the jump, accounting for momentum flux and hydrostatic pressure forces at the upstream and downstream sections, is $\\rho\\, h_1 u_1^2 + \\dfrac{1}{2}\\,\\rho g h_1^2 = \\rho\\, h_2 u_2^2 + \\dfrac{1}{2}\\,\\rho g h_2^2$.**\nMy derivation of the momentum balance resulted in this exact equation. The term $\\rho u^2 h$ represents the momentum flux per unit width, and the term $\\frac{1}{2} \\rho g h^2$ represents the hydrostatic pressure force per unit width. The equation correctly states the conservation of the sum of these two quantities (the specific force) across the jump.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**C. Since the flow is steady, the pointwise differential momentum equation implies continuity of velocity across the jump, so $u_1 = u_2$.**\nThis statement is fundamentally flawed. The problem itself correctly states that the differential form of the equations is invalid at the jump. A hydraulic jump is, by definition, a region of sharp discontinuity where flow properties change rapidly. The flow decelerates from supercritical ($u_1 > \\sqrt{gh_1}$) to subcritical ($u_2  \\sqrt{gh_2}$), meaning $u_1 > u_2$. To claim the differential form implies continuity of velocity is a gross misapplication of a mathematical tool outside its domain of validity.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. Combining the valid mass and momentum balances yields the sequent-depth relation $\\,\\dfrac{h_2}{h_1} = \\dfrac{1}{2}\\Big(\\sqrt{1 + 8\\,\\mathrm{Fr}_1^2}\\; - 1\\Big)\\,$.**\nI will now derive this relation. Start with the momentum balance:\n$\\frac{1}{2} g (h_2^2 - h_1^2) = u_1^2 h_1 - u_2^2 h_2$.\nFrom mass balance, $u_2 = u_1 (h_1/h_2)$. Substitute this into the equation:\n$\\frac{1}{2} g (h_2 - h_1)(h_2 + h_1) = u_1^2 h_1 - \\left(u_1 \\frac{h_1}{h_2}\\right)^2 h_2 = u_1^2 h_1 - u_1^2 \\frac{h_1^2}{h_2} = u_1^2 h_1 \\left(1 - \\frac{h_1}{h_2}\\right) = u_1^2 h_1 \\frac{h_2 - h_1}{h_2}$.\nFor a jump, $h_2 \\neq h_1$, so we can divide by $(h_2 - h_1)$:\n$\\frac{1}{2} g (h_2 + h_1) = \\frac{u_1^2 h_1}{h_2}$.\nMultiply by $2h_2 / (gh_1^2)$:\n$\\frac{h_2(h_2+h_1)}{h_1^2} = \\frac{2 u_1^2 h_1}{g h_1^2} = 2 \\frac{u_1^2}{g h_1} = 2 \\mathrm{Fr}_1^2$.\nLet $Y = h_2/h_1$. The equation becomes $Y(Y+1) = 2 \\mathrm{Fr}_1^2$, or $Y^2 + Y - 2 \\mathrm{Fr}_1^2 = 0$.\nSolving this quadratic equation for $Y$ gives:\n$Y = \\dfrac{-1 \\pm \\sqrt{1 - 4(1)(-2 \\mathrm{Fr}_1^2)}}{2} = \\dfrac{-1 \\pm \\sqrt{1 + 8 \\mathrm{Fr}_1^2}}{2}$.\nSince depth ratio $Y=h_2/h_1$ must be positive, we take the positive root:\n$\\dfrac{h_2}{h_1} = \\dfrac{\\sqrt{1 + 8 \\mathrm{Fr}_1^2} - 1}{2}$.\nThis matches the statement. The derivation is correct.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**E. The hydrostatic pressure term should be omitted from the integral momentum balance across a stationary jump in a horizontal channel, because hydrostatic pressure is uniform with depth.**\nThis statement is incorrect for two principal reasons. First, the premise \"hydrostatic pressure is uniform with depth\" is false; it varies linearly with depth. Second, the net pressure force, arising from the difference in hydrostatic pressure distributions upstream ($h_1$) and downstream ($h_2$), is the very force that causes the change in the fluid's momentum. Omitting this term would violate Newton's second law.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**F. Because the velocity decreases abruptly across the jump, the steady mass flux $h u$ must decrease, so $h_1 u_1 > h_2 u_2$.**\nThis statement contradicts the principle of mass conservation for a steady flow in a constant-width channel. As established in the analysis for option A, mass conservation dictates that the mass flux (and for an incompressible fluid, the volume flux) is constant across the jump. That is, $h_1 u_1 = h_2 u_2$. While velocity $u$ does indeed decrease, the depth $h$ increases correspondingly to keep the product $hu$ constant.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\nFinal conclusion: Statements A, B, and D correctly describe the physics of a hydraulic jump using integral conservation laws.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{ABD}$$", "id": "2404168"}]}
