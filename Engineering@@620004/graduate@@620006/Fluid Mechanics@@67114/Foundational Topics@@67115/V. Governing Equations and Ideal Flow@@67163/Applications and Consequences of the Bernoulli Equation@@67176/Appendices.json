To solve it, you will need to skillfully combine two of the most powerful tools in fluid mechanics: the Bernoulli equation for energy conservation and the linear momentum equation applied to a carefully chosen control volume. This practice is invaluable for understanding how energy and momentum principles work in tandem to predict complex flow phenomena like the \"vena contracta\" [@problem_id:457004].", "problem": "A large, open tank contains an ideal, incompressible fluid of density $\\rho$. The fluid level is maintained at a constant height $h$ above the centerline of a \"Borda mouthpiece,\" which is a short, cylindrical tube of cross-sectional area $A_0$ that projects into the tank (re-entrant). The fluid exits the mouthpiece into the atmosphere as a jet. Due to the re-entrant geometry, the fluid flow separates from the inner lip of the tube, and the jet contracts to a minimum cross-sectional area $A_j$ at a section downstream called the \"vena contracta.\" At the vena contracta, the streamlines are assumed to be parallel.\n\nAssume the fluid is inviscid, the flow is steady, and the tank's cross-sectional area is large enough that the fluid velocity at the free surface can be neglected. The pressure at the free surface and throughout the exiting jet is the ambient atmospheric pressure.\n\nBy applying the principles of conservation of energy (in the form of the Bernoulli equation) and conservation of linear momentum (using an appropriate control volume), derive the theoretical value for the coefficient of contraction, $C_c = A_j / A_0$.", "solution": "1. **Energy Conservation (Bernoulli):** Apply Bernoulli's equation between the free surface (point 1) and the vena contracta (point j).
