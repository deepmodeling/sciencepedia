This exercise challenges you to analyze a fluid system in a non-inertial reference frame by considering an effective gravitational field that includes the effects of acceleration. By deriving the height difference in an accelerating U-tube manometer, you will gain a deeper understanding of how pressure fields respond to external body forces, a key concept in aerospace and vehicle dynamics. [@problem_id:524112]", "problem": "A U-tube manometer has two vertical arms with a constant inner cross-sectional area, separated by a horizontal distance $L$. The tube contains two immiscible fluids. The lower, denser fluid has a uniform density $\\rho_1$, and the upper, lighter fluid has a uniform density $\\rho_2$. The quantity of the fluids is sufficient such that the denser fluid ($\\rho_1$) fills the bottom horizontal section and extends partially up both vertical arms, while the lighter fluid ($\\rho_2$) partially fills the remainder of both vertical arms, creating two free surfaces exposed to the same constant atmospheric pressure.\n\nThe entire apparatus is subjected to a constant horizontal acceleration $\\vec{a}$, directed parallel to the horizontal section of the tube. In the resulting steady state, the fluid surfaces are tilted. Let the vertical height of the free surface in the arm at the rear (with respect to the acceleration vector) be $h_L$, and in the arm at the front be $h_R$.\n\nDerive a symbolic expression for the difference in vertical height, $\\Delta h = h_L - h_R$, between the two free surfaces.

Given $\\mathbf{g} = -g\\mathbf{j}$ and $\\mathbf{a} = a\\mathbf{i}$, this becomes:\n    $$ \\mathbf{g}_{\\text{eff}} = -a\\mathbf{i} - g\\mathbf{j} $$\n2.  **Hydrostatic Equilibrium:** The fundamental equation of hydrostatics in this non-inertial frame is $\\nabla P = \\rho \\mathbf{g}_{\\text{eff}}$. This equation states that the pressure gradient vector $\\nabla P$ is parallel to the effective gravity vector $\\mathbf{g}_{\\text{eff}}$.\n3.  **Slope of Isobars:** Surfaces of constant pressure (isobars) must be perpendicular to the pressure gradient, and therefore perpendicular to $\\mathbf{g}_{\\text{eff}}$. The slope of the vector $\\mathbf{g}_{\\text{eff}}$ is $(-g)/(-a) = g/a$. The slope of any line perpendicular to it is the negative reciprocal, which is $-a/g$. Therefore, all isobaric surfaces must be planes with a slope given by:\n    $$ \\frac{dy}{dx} = -\\frac{a}{g} $$\n4.  **Calculating the Height Difference:** The two free surfaces in the vertical arms are exposed to the same constant atmospheric pressure, so they lie on the same isobaric surface ($P = P_{\\text{atm}}$). Let the coordinates of the surface in the left arm be $(x_L, y_L) = (0, h_L)$ and in the right arm be $(x_R, y_R) = (L, h_R)$.\n5.

This practice delves into the phenomenon of surface tension, governed by the Young-Laplace equation, which dictates the pressure jump across a curved meniscus.

A narrow, vertically oriented conical tube, with its tip pointing downwards, is lowered into the reservoir such that its tip is submerged. The liquid is observed to rise inside the conical tube due to capillary action. The tube geometry is defined by a constant half-angle $\\alpha$, which is the angle between the tube's wall and its vertical axis of symmetry. The liquid is perfectly wetting, meaning the contact angle between the liquid and the tube's inner wall is zero.\n\nAssuming the curved liquid surface (meniscus) inside the tube can be approximated as a spherical cap, derive an expression for the equilibrium height $h$ to which the liquid rises. This height $h$ is measured from the level of the free surface in the reservoir to the three-phase (solid-liquid-gas) contact line, and should be expressed as a function of the local radius $r$ of the tube at that contact line. The acceleration due to gravity is $g$.", "solution": "The problem asks for the equilibrium height $h$ of a liquid in a conical tube as a function of the local radius $r$. The equilibrium is established by a balance between the hydrostatic pressure of the liquid column and the capillary pressure across the curved meniscus.\n\n1.  **Hydrostatic Pressure Balance:**\n    The pressure inside the liquid at a depth $h$ below the meniscus is higher than the pressure just below the meniscus by $\\rho g h$. The pressure just below the meniscus is $p_{liquid}$, and the pressure at the level of the external free surface is the atmospheric pressure, $p_{atm}$.

The cone wall is a straight line making an angle $\\alpha$ with the vertical axis. The normal to this wall therefore makes an angle $\\alpha$ with the horizontal axis.\n\n    Since the contact angle is zero, the meniscus (a spherical cap) is tangent to the cone wall at the contact line. This means the normal to the meniscus surface at the contact line is identical to the normal to the cone wall.\n    \n    The center of the spherical cap must lie on the axis of symmetry (the vertical axis) due to the axisymmetry of the problem. Let the contact line be at a radius $r$ and height $h$. Let the center of the sphere of which the meniscus is a part be at a coordinate $(0, z_c)$ in a coordinate system where the horizontal axis is at height $h$. The contact point is at $(r, 0)$. The radius of curvature $R_c$ is the distance from the center $(0, z_c)$ to the contact point $(r, 0)$.\n    $$\n    R_c^2 = (r-0)^2 + (0 - z_c)^2 = r^2 + z_c^2\n    $$\n    The vector normal to the spherical surface at $(r, 0)$ points from the surface point towards the center of curvature, i.e., it is in the direction of the vector from $(r,0)$ to $(0, z_c)$, which is $(-r, z_c)$. The angle $\\beta$ that this normal vector makes with the horizontal is given by $\\tan \\beta = |z_c / (-r)| = |z_c|/r$.\n    \n    As established, this normal direction must be the same as the wall's normal direction.
