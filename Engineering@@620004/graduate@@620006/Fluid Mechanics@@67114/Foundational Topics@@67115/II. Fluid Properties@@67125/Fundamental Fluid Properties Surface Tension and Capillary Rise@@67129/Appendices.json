Downward Force (Weight of the Liquid Column)**\n\nThe downward force, $F_{down}$, is the weight of the liquid column of height $h$ inside the tube. Since the density $\\rho(z)$ varies with height $z$, we must calculate the weight by integrating over the height of the column.\n\nConsider a thin horizontal slice of the liquid column at height $z$ with thickness $dz$.
