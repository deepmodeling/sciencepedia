While many textbooks analyze this phenomenon in a simple circular tube, this exercise challenges you to apply the same core principles to a more complex geometry—a tube with a triangular cross-section. By balancing the upward force created by surface tension along the contact line with the weight of the liquid column, you will develop a foundational understanding of how surface tension can perform mechanical work against gravity. This practice reinforces the direct link between fluid properties, geometry, and macroscopic behavior [@problem_id:612008].", "problem": "A long, vertical tube with an open top and bottom is constructed from a material that is perfectly wetted by a certain liquid.
