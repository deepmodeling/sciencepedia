This practice explores this very question, not through a full-scale simulation, but through the elegant lens of energy conservation. By balancing the initial kinetic energy of an impacting droplet against the surface energy required to create a new liquid film, we can derive a powerful scaling law [@problem_id:613047]. This exercise is a fantastic demonstration of how fundamental principles can be used to understand and quantify dynamic fluid phenomena, highlighting the importance of the Weber number, $W_e$, which compares inertial forces to surface tension forces.", "problem": "A spherical liquid droplet, with initial radius $R_0$, density $\\rho$, and surface tension $\\sigma$, impacts a dry, solid, horizontal surface at a normal velocity $V_0$. Upon impact, the droplet deforms and spreads into a thin, circular liquid film or \"lamella\". This spreading motion continues until the lamella reaches a maximum radius, $R_{max}$, at which point it momentarily stops before potentially retracting. This problem asks for the derivation of a scaling law that describes this maximum spreading radius.\n\nWe will analyze this phenomenon in the inertia-dominated regime, where the initial kinetic energy of the droplet is primarily converted into surface energy. For this purpose, several simplifying assumptions are made:\n\n1.  The impact process is characterized by a large Weber number, defined as $We = \\frac{\\rho (2R_0) V_0^2}{\\sigma}$, where $We \\gg 1$.\n2.  Any energy loss due to viscous dissipation within the spreading liquid is considered negligible compared to the initial kinetic energy.\n3.  At the point of maximum radial expansion, the kinetic energy of the droplet is assumed to be fully converted. The droplet is modeled as a simple flat, cylindrical disk of radius $R_{max}$.\n4.  In the high Weber number regime, one expects $R_{max} \\gg R_0$. Consequently, the change in surface energy, $\\Delta E_s$, is dominated by the creation of the large top liquid-air interface of the disk. You can therefore approximate this change in surface energy as being equal to the surface energy of this top surface alone: $\\Delta E_s \\approx \\sigma \\pi R_{max}^2$.\n\nBy constructing an energy balance equating the initial kinetic energy of the droplet with the work done against surface tension (approximated as $\\Delta E_s$), derive the scaling law that relates the normalized maximum radius, $\\frac{R_{max}}{R_0}$, to the Weber number, $We$.
