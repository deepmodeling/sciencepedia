Before delving into complex correlations, it's crucial to understand the fundamental physical mechanism responsible for the velocity profile's development.

This fluid is often referred to as an \"inviscid fluid\". The fluid flows from a large reservoir into a long, straight, circular pipe of constant diameter $D$. At the pipe entrance (axial position $x=0$), the velocity profile is perfectly uniform across the cross-section, given by $u(r) = U_0$, where $U_0$ is a constant velocity.\n\nThe hydrodynamic entry length, $L_e$, is defined as the distance from the pipe entrance to the point where the velocity profile becomes fully developed, meaning it no longer changes with increasing axial distance $x$.\n\nWhich of the following statements most accurately describes the hydrodynamic entry length $L_e$ for this inviscid fluid flow?\n\nA. $L_e$ is a finite, non-zero value that is proportional to the pipe diameter $D$ and the flow velocity $U_0$.\nB. $L_e$ is infinitely long ($L_e \\to \\infty$) because the absence of viscous forces prevents the flow from ever reaching a stable, fully developed state.\nC. $L_e$ is exactly zero ($L_e = 0$) because the velocity profile is already fully developed at the entrance.\nD. The concept of an entry length is not applicable to inviscid flow, so $L_e$ is undefined.\nE. $L_e$ depends on the Reynolds number, which becomes infinite, implying a turbulent-like entry behavior even at low speeds.", "solution": "To determine the hydrodynamic entry length for an inviscid fluid, we must first understand the physical mechanism that causes the velocity profile to develop in a real, viscous fluid.\n\nThe hydrodynamic entry length, $L_e$, is the axial distance required for the flow to transition from an initial profile (often uniform) at the pipe inlet to a final, unchanging velocity profile known as the \"fully developed\" profile.\n\nIn a viscous fluid, the development of the velocity profile is driven by shear stresses. Due to the no-slip boundary condition, the fluid layer in direct contact with the stationary pipe wall must have zero velocity. The adjacent fluid layers are slowed down by viscous shear forces, described by Newton's law of viscosity, $\\tau = \\mu \\frac{du}{dr}$, where $\\mu$ is the dynamic viscosity and $\\frac{du}{dr}$ is the velocity gradient. This region of retarded flow near the wall is called the boundary layer. As the fluid moves down the pipe, this boundary layer grows in thickness. The entry region is the section of the pipe where this boundary layer is growing. The flow is considered fully developed when the boundary layer has grown to fill the entire pipe, reaching the centerline.\n\nNow, let's consider the hypothetical case of an inviscid fluid, where the dynamic viscosity $\\mu$ is exactly zero. The immediate consequence of $\\mu=0$ is that the shear stress $\\tau$ is always zero, regardless of the velocity gradient.\n\nWith no shear forces, there is no mechanism to slow the fluid down near the pipe wall. The no-slip boundary condition does not apply. Instead, the fluid is free to \"slip\" past the wall without any friction. The problem states that the fluid enters the pipe with a uniform velocity profile, $u(r) = U_0$. Since there are no viscous forces to alter this profile, every fluid particle continues to move down the pipe with the same constant velocity $U_0$. The velocity profile remains uniform, $u(r, x) = U_0$, for all axial positions $x \\ge 0$.\n\nAccording to the definition, a flow is fully developed when its velocity profile no longer changes with axial distance. For this inviscid flow, the velocity profile *never* changes; it is constant for all $x$. This means the flow is fully developed at the very entrance of the pipe, i.e., at $x=0$. The distance required for the flow to *become* fully developed is therefore zero. Hence, $L_e = 0$.\n\nLet's evaluate the given options based on this reasoning:\n- A is incorrect. A finite, non-zero entry length is characteristic of viscous flows where a boundary layer must grow. This process is absent here.\n- B is incorrect. This option incorrectly assumes that \"fully developed\" must mean a specific non-uniform profile (like the parabolic profile in viscous laminar flow). However, the definition is simply that the profile is unchanging with axial distance. A uniform profile that remains uniform is, by definition, fully developed.\n- C is correct. As explained above, the absence of viscous forces means the initial uniform profile never changes. Thus, the flow is fully developed from the beginning, and the entry length is zero.\n- D is incorrect. The concept of entry length is well-defined. We can ask the question of how long it takes for the profile to become unchanging. The answer is simply that it takes zero distance. The length is defined, and its value is 0.\n- E is incorrect. The Reynolds number, $Re = \\frac{\\rho U_0 D}{\\mu}$, indeed approaches infinity as $\\mu \\to 0$. However, empirical correlations for entry length, like $L_e/D \\approx 0.06 Re$ for laminar flow, are derived based on the physics of viscous boundary layer growth and are not applicable to an inviscid fluid. Furthermore, turbulence is a complex phenomenon involving vortex stretching and viscous dissipation of energy, concepts that are fundamentally tied to viscosity.

It is a standard problem in internal flow fluid dynamics.\n\nPart 1: Derivation and Integration of the Mechanical Energy Equation\n\nWe are tasked to derive the one-dimensional mechanical energy equation. This equation is a form of the extended Bernoulli equation applied to a differential control volume. We consider a cylindrical control volume of length $dx$ and diameter $D$. The mechanical energy balance for a steady, incompressible flow through this control volume states that the net rate of work done on the fluid by pressure forces must equal the rate of increase of the kinetic energy flux plus the rate of energy dissipation due to viscous effects. For a horizontal tube, gravitational potential energy is constant.\n\nThe differential form of the mechanical energy balance for a section of duct of length $dx$ is written as:\n$$\nd(\\dot{E}_p) + d(\\dot{E}_k) + d\\dot{E}_v = 0\n$$\nwhere $d(\\dot{E}_p)$ is the rate of work done by pressure, $d(\\dot{E}_k)$ is the change in the rate of kinetic energy transport, and $d\\dot{E}_v$ is the rate of viscous dissipation.\n\nThe rate of kinetic energy passing through a cross-section $A$ is given by:\n$$\n\\dot{E}_k(x) = \\int_{A} \\frac{1}{2} u^2(r,x) (\\rho u(r,x) dA) = \\frac{1}{2}\\rho \\int_{A} u^3(r,x) dA\n$$\nUsing the definition of the kinetic energy correction factor, $\\alpha(x) \\equiv \\frac{1}{A\\,U_{m}^{3}} \\int_{A} u^{3}(r,x)\\,dA$, we can write:\n$$\n\\dot{E}_k(x) = \\alpha(x) \\frac{1}{2} \\rho A U_m^3\n$$\nThe change in kinetic energy flux over the differential length $dx$ is then:\n$$\nd(\\dot{E}_k) = \\frac{d\\dot{E}_k}{dx}dx = \\frac{d}{dx} \\left( \\alpha(x) \\frac{1}{2} \\rho A U_m^3 \\right) dx = \\frac{1}{2} \\rho A U_m^3 \\frac{d\\alpha}{dx} dx\n$$\nThe rate of work done by pressure forces on the control volume is the net flow of pressure energy, which, for a pressure $p(x)$ that is uniform over the cross section, is:\n$$\nd(\\dot{E}_p) = [p(x) U_m A] - [p(x+dx) U_m A] = -A U_m \\frac{dp}{dx} dx\n$$\nThe rate of viscous dissipation within the fluid is directly related to the work done by shear stresses. This lost mechanical energy is converted to internal energy. The rate of this loss over the length $dx$ is given by the shear work done by the wall on the fluid, integrated over the wall surface area $\\pi D dx$. This term is equivalent to the pressure drop required to overcome wall friction. The power dissipated is:\n$$\nd\\dot{E}_v = (\\tau_w \\pi D dx) U_m\n$$\nwhere $\\tau_w$ is the wall shear stress. This identification may feel indirect. A more rigorous approach relates the pressure gradient part that drives the flow against friction. The total pressure gradient has a part to change momentum and a part to overcome wall shear. It can be shown that the portion of the pressure work that is dissipated by viscous forces is equal to $\\frac{dp_{friction}}{dx} A U_m dx$. For flow in a duct, the frictional pressure gradient is related to wall shear by $\\frac{dp_{friction}}{dx} = -\\frac{4\\tau_w}{D}$. Thus, the power dissipated is $( \\frac{4\\tau_w}{D} A U_m) dx$.\n\nThe total mechanical energy balance is constructed by dividing the sum of energy rate changes by the volumetric flow rate $Q = A U_m$:\n$$\n-A U_m \\frac{dp}{dx} dx + \\frac{1}{2} \\rho A U_m^3 \\frac{d\\alpha}{dx} dx + \\frac{4\\tau_w}{D} A U_m dx = 0 \n$$\nThis equation is not quite correct. The standard derivation equates the change in mechanical energy flux to the rate of irreversible conversion to thermal energy (dissipation). The rate of dissipation in the volume $A dx$ for a developed flow is $\\dot{E}_v = (A U_m) dp_f = (A U_m) \\frac{4\\tau_w}{D} dx$.

Consequently, the ratio of hydrodynamic entry lengths predicted by this first-principles scaling is determined solely by the square of the hydraulic diameters:\n$$\n\\frac{L_{h,\\mathcal{T}}}{L_{h,\\mathcal{S}}} \\;=\\; \\frac{\\kappa\\,(\\rho U_{m}/\\mu)\\,D_{h,\\mathcal{T}}^{2}}{\\kappa\\,(\\rho U_{m}/\\mu)\\,D_{h,\\mathcal{S}}^{2}} \\;=\\; \\left(\\frac{D_{h,\\mathcal{T}}}{D_{h,\\mathcal{S}}}\\right)^{2}.\n$$\n\nWe now compute $D_{h}$ for each cross-section, using the fact that $A$ is common to both ducts.\n\nFor the square duct $\\mathcal{S}$ with side $s$,\n$$\nA = s^{2}, \\qquad P_{\\mathcal{S}} = 4s, \\qquad D_{h,\\mathcal{S}} = \\frac{4A}{P_{\\mathcal{S}}} = \\frac{4s^{2}}{4s} = s.\n$$\n\nFor the equilateral triangular duct $\\mathcal{T}$ with side $a$,\n$$\nA = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{4}\\,a^{2}, \\qquad P_{\\mathcal{T}} = 3a, \\qquad D_{h,\\mathcal{T}} = \\frac{4A}{P_{\\mathcal{T}}} = \\frac{4\\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{4}a^{2}\\right)}{3a} = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{3}\\,a.\n$$\n\nBecause $A$ is the same for both, we have\n$$\ns^{2} = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{4}\\,a^{2} \\;\\;\\Longrightarrow\\;\\; \\frac{a}{s} = \\sqrt{\\frac{4}{\\sqrt{3}}} = \\frac{2}{3^{1/4}}.\n$$\nTherefore,\n$$\n\\frac{D_{h,\\mathcal{T}}}{D_{h,\\mathcal{S}}} = \\frac{\\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{3}\\,a\\right)}{s} = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{3}\\,\\frac{a}{s} = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{3}\\,\\frac{2}{3^{1/4}} = \\frac{2}{3^{3/4}}.\n$$\nFinally, the ratio of entry lengths is\n$$\n\\frac{L_{h,\\mathcal{T}}}{L_{h,\\mathcal{S}}} = \\left(\\frac{2}{3^{3/4}}\\right)^{2} = \\frac{4}{3^{3/2}} = \\frac{4}{3\\sqrt{3}}.\n$$\n\nThis exact value depends only on the cross-sectional geometries and the equality of $A$ and $Q$, not on the fluid properties or flow rate individually, because those factors cancel in the ratio.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{4}{3\\sqrt{3}}}$$", "id": "2495017"}]}
