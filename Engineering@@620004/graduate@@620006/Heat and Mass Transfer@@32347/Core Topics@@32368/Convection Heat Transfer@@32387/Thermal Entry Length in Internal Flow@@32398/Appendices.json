In the thermal entrance region, temperature gradients are confined to a thin layer of thickness $\\delta_t(x)$ near the tube wall. Within this layer, we can approximate the derivatives and variables by their characteristic scales:\n- The axial gradient of temperature scales as $\\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial x} \\sim \\frac{\\Delta T}{x}$, where $\\Delta T$ is the characteristic temperature difference, $|T_w - T_i|$, and $x$ is the downstream distance from the inlet.\n- The radial conduction term is dominated by the second derivative in the thin layer, so $\\alpha \\left( \\frac{1}{r} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial r} \\left( r \\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial r} \\right) \\right) \\sim \\alpha \\frac{\\Delta T}{\\delta_t^2}$.\n\nThe energy equation thus scales as:\n$$\nu_{\\text{char}} \\frac{\\Delta T}{x} \\sim \\alpha \\frac{\\Delta T}{\\delta_t^2}\n$$\nThe choice of the characteristic velocity, $u_{\\text{char}}$, is critical. The thermal energy is convected downstream by the entire flow. The mean velocity, $U_m$, represents the average rate of transport of fluid, and therefore thermal energy, through any cross-section of the tube. While the local velocity varies from $0$ at the wall to a maximum at the centerline, $U_m$ is the correct velocity scale for the bulk advection process that governs the overall growth of the thermal layer along the length of the tube. Thus, we select $u_{\\text{char}} = U_m$.\n\nSubstituting $u_{\\text{char}} = U_m$ into the scaled energy balance gives:\n$$\nU_m \\frac{1}{x} \\sim \\frac{\\alpha}{\\delta_t^2}\n$$\nSolving for the thermal penetration thickness, $\\delta_t$, we obtain its scaling with $x$:\n$$\n\\delta_t^2(x) \\sim \\frac{\\alpha x}{U_m} \\implies \\delta_t(x) \\sim \\sqrt{\\frac{\\alpha x}{U_m}}\n$$\nThis result shows that the thermal layer thickness grows diffusively with the square root of the downstream distance.\n\nNext, we define the thermal entrance length, $x_{\\text{th}}$, as the axial distance where the thermal penetration thickness becomes comparable to the characteristic radial dimension of the tube, which is its diameter $D$.

In the case of simultaneous development (SD), the velocity profile is initially uniform. The developing velocity boundary layer is very thin at the entrance, resulting in high fluid velocities close to the wall compared to the fully developed parabolic profile (FDH), where the velocity is zero at the wall and increases slowly. This higher near-wall velocity in the SD case enhances the convection of heat away from the surface, leading to a significantly higher local heat transfer coefficient (and thus a higher Nusselt number) in the entrance region. Because the heat transfer is more effective, the thermal profile approaches its fully developed state more rapidly, resulting in a shorter thermal entry length.\n\nFinally, we compute the ratio $r$:\n$$ r = \\frac{x_{th,FDH}}{x_{th,SD}} = \\frac{\\frac{D \\cdot Re \\cdot Pr}{Gz_{FDH}}}{\\frac{D \\cdot Re \\cdot Pr}{Gz_{SD}}} = \\frac{Gz_{SD}}{Gz_{FDH}} $$\n$$ r = \\frac{33}{20} = 1.65 $$\nRounding to four significant figures, as required, gives $r = 1.6500$.", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{1.650} $$", "id": "2530608"}, {"introduction": "Our final practice moves beyond the fluid to consider the role of the solid boundary itself in a conjugate heat transfer problem. You will derive a dimensionless parameter that weighs the ability of the pipe wall to conduct heat circumferentially against the rate of heat removal by the fluid radially.

Based on the magnitude of $M$, state qualitatively which limit the internal thermal boundary condition tends toward in the entrance region: Uniform Wall Temperature (UWT) or Uniform Heat Flux (UHF), and justify your choice briefly in terms of the relative strength of wall circumferential conduction versus fluid-side thermal transport.\n\nReport $M$ as a pure number (dimensionless) rounded to three significant figures.", "solution": "The problem requires the construction and evaluation of a dimensionless parameter, $M$, which quantifies the relative importance of circumferential heat conduction in the tube wall compared to radial heat transfer into the fluid. This parameter will then be used to determine whether the thermal boundary condition at the inner wall tends toward Uniform Wall Temperature (UWT) or Uniform Heat Flux (UHF) in the entrance region.\n\nThe physical principle is to compare the thermal conductance for the two competing heat transfer paths. A non-uniform circumferential temperature profile, $T_w(\\theta)$, can only be sustained if the heat removed by the fluid radially varies with circumference, and if the wall itself cannot conduct heat fast enough circumferentially to smooth out these temperature differences.\n\nLet us construct the parameter $M$ by scaling the two relevant heat transfer mechanisms as instructed, using the provided characteristic lengths and material properties.\n\n1.  **Scaling of Circumferential Heat Conduction in the Wall:**\n    We consider the capacity of the solid tube wall to conduct heat in the circumferential (azimuthal) direction, $\\theta$. According to Fourier's law of heat conduction, the rate of heat transfer, $q$, is proportional to the thermal conductivity, the cross-sectional area, and the temperature gradient.\n    Let's consider a characteristic temperature difference $\\Delta T_w$ occurring over a circumferential arc length $L_\\theta$. A natural scale for this length is the tube diameter, $D$. The cross-sectional area for heat flow in this direction, for a tube of axial length $\\Delta x$, is $A_s = t_s \\Delta x$.\n    The rate of heat conduction in the circumferential direction, $q_{s, \\theta}$, can thus be scaled as:\n    $$q_{s, \\theta} \\sim k_s A_s \\frac{\\Delta T_w}{L_\\theta} \\sim k_s (t_s \\Delta x) \\frac{\\Delta T_w}{D}$$\n    The thermal conductance in the circumferential direction per unit axial length, $K'_{s, \\theta}$, represents this heat transfer capacity. It is the heat transfer rate per unit temperature difference per unit axial length:\n    $$K'_{s, \\theta} = \\frac{q_{s, \\theta}}{\\Delta T_w \\Delta x} \\sim \\frac{k_s t_s}{D}$$\n\n2.  **Scaling of Radial Heat Conduction on the Fluid Side:**\n    Next, we consider the capacity of the fluid to transport heat away from the inner wall in the radial direction, $r$. This heat transfer imposes the thermal load that the circumferential wall conduction must overcome to maintain a uniform temperature.\n    The rate of heat transfer from the wall to the fluid, $q_{f, r}$, is governed by conduction in the fluid layer adjacent to the wall. The area for this heat transfer over the considered circumferential segment is $A_f = L_\\theta \\Delta x \\sim D \\Delta x$.\n    The problem specifies to use the tube diameter $D$ as the characteristic length for the near-wall conduction scale on the fluid side. This implies scaling the radial temperature gradient in the fluid as $\\Delta T_w / D$.\n    The rate of radial heat conduction into the fluid is therefore scaled as:\n    $$q_{f, r} \\sim k A_f \\frac{\\Delta T_w}{D} \\sim k (D \\Delta x) \\frac{\\Delta T_w}{D} = k \\Delta x \\Delta T_w$$\n    The corresponding radial thermal conductance of the fluid per unit axial length, $K'_{f,r}$, is:\n    $$K'_{f, r} = \\frac{q_{f, r}}{\\Delta T_w \\Delta x} \\sim k$$\n\n3.  **Construction of the Dimensionless Parameter $M$:**\n    The dimensionless parameter $M$ is defined as the ratio of the wall's circumferential heat conduction capacity to the fluid's radial heat conduction capacity.\n    $$M = \\frac{K'_{s, \\theta}}{K'_{f, r}} \\sim \\frac{k_s t_s / D}{k}$$\n    Thus, the dimensionless parameter is:\n    $$M = \\frac{k_s t_s}{k D}$$\n    This parameter compares the ability of the wall to smooth out temperature variations circumferentially ($k_s t_s$) with the ability of the fluid to extract heat and sustain such variations ($k D$).\n\n4.  **Evaluation of $M$:**\n    The problem provides the following values:\n    - Inner diameter: $D = 10~\\text{mm} = 10 \\times 10^{-3}~\\text{m}$\n    - Wall thickness: $t_s = 1~\\text{mm} = 1 \\times 10^{-3}~\\text{m}$\n    - Wall thermal conductivity: $k_s = 15~\\text{W}\\,(\\text{m}\\,\\text{K})^{-1}$\n    - Fluid thermal conductivity: $k = 0.6~\\text{W}\\,(\\text{m}\\,\\text{K})^{-1}$\n\n    Substituting these values into the expression for $M$:\n    $$M = \\frac{(15~\\text{W}\\,(\\text{m}\\,\\text{K})^{-1}) \\times (1 \\times 10^{-3}~\\text{m})}{(0.6~\\text{W}\\,(\\text{m}\\,\\text{K})^{-1}) \\times (10 \\times 10^{-3}~\\text{m})} = \\frac{0.015}{0.006} = 2.5$$\n    Rounding to three significant figures as requested, we have $M = 2.50$.\n\n5.  **Qualitative Interpretation and Justification:**\n    The parameter $M$ represents the ratio of the thermal resistance of the fluid in the radial direction to the thermal resistance of the wall in the circumferential direction.\n    - If $M \\gg 1$, the circumferential thermal resistance of the wall is much smaller than the radial thermal resistance of the fluid. This means heat can spread very easily around the wall's circumference compared to how quickly it is removed by the fluid. Any potential temperature non-uniformities are effectively 'short-circuited' by the high thermal-conduction wall. This forces the inner wall temperature to be nearly uniform, approaching the Uniform Wall Temperature (UWT) boundary condition.\n    - If $M \\ll 1$, the wall's resistance to circumferential heat flow is large. It is much easier for heat to flow into the fluid than to be redistributed around the wall. In this case, local variations in the heat transfer to the fluid would cause significant local temperature variations in the wall, and the condition would tend away from UWT. If the cause of the non-uniformity were an externally applied heat flux, this limit would approach a Uniform Heat Flux (UHF) condition at the inner wall.\n\n    For the given problem, $M = 2.50$. Since $M > 1$, the capacity for circumferential conduction in the wall is dominant over the radial thermal transport scale in the fluid. Therefore, the internal thermal boundary condition in the entrance region will tend toward the **Uniform Wall Temperature (UWT)** limit. The wall is sufficiently conductive to mitigate the development of significant temperature gradients along its circumference.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{2.50}\n$$", "id": "2530617"}]}
