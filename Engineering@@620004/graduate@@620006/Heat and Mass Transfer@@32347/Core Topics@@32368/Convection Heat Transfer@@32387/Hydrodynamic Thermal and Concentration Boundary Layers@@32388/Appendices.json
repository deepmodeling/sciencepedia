It presents a standard, well-posed problem in convective heat transfer, grounded in established principles of boundary layer theory and the integral method. All required data and conditions are provided, and there are no scientific or logical inconsistencies. We may therefore proceed with the solution.\n\nThe objective is to derive the local Nusselt number using the Kármán-Pohlhausen integral method for a specific set of assumed velocity and temperature profiles and to compare the result with a known similarity solution for the case of Prandtl number $\\mathrm{Pr} = 1$.\n\nFirst, we address the hydrodynamics. The von Kármán momentum integral equation for a steady, incompressible, two-dimensional laminar boundary layer over a flat plate (where the pressure gradient is zero) is\n$$\n\\frac{d}{dx} \\int_{0}^{\\delta(x)} u(U_{\\infty} - u) \\, dy = \\frac{\\tau_w}{\\rho}\n$$\nwhere $u$ is the fluid velocity in the $x$-direction, $U_{\\infty}$ is the free-stream velocity, $\\delta(x)$ is the hydrodynamic boundary layer thickness, $\\rho$ is the fluid density, and $\\tau_w$ is the wall shear stress.\n\nThe wall shear stress is given by Newton's law of viscosity, $\\tau_w = \\mu (\\partial u / \\partial y)_{y=0}$, where $\\mu$ is the dynamic viscosity. Using the provided velocity profile, $u/U_{\\infty} = 2\\eta - 2\\eta^3 + \\eta^4$ with $\\eta = y/\\delta$, we find the velocity gradient at the wall:\n$$\n\\left. \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial y} \\right|_{y=0} = \\left. \\frac{U_{\\infty}}{\\delta} \\frac{d}{d\\eta}\\left(\\frac{u}{U_{\\infty}}\\right) \\right|_{\\eta=0} = \\frac{U_{\\infty}}{\\delta} \\left. (2 - 6\\eta^2 + 4\\eta^3) \\right|_{\\eta=0} = \\frac{2U_{\\infty}}{\\delta}\n$$\nThus, the wall shear stress is $\\tau_w = 2\\mu U_{\\infty}/\\delta$.\n\nNext, we evaluate the integral term in the momentum equation. We introduce the non-dimensional variable $\\eta = y/\\delta$:\n$$\n\\int_{0}^{\\delta} u(U_{\\infty} - u) \\, dy = U_{\\infty}^2 \\delta \\int_{0}^{1} \\frac{u}{U_{\\infty}} \\left(1 - \\frac{u}{U_{\\infty}}\\right) \\, d\\eta\n$$\nLet the profile be $f(\\eta) = u/U_{\\infty} = 2\\eta - 2\\eta^3 + \\eta^4$. The integral becomes\n$$\nI_M = \\int_{0}^{1} f(\\eta)(1 - f(\\eta)) \\, d\\eta = \\int_{0}^{1} (2\\eta - 2\\eta^3 + \\eta^4)(1 - 2\\eta + 2\\eta^3 - \\eta^4) \\, d\\eta\n$$\nExpanding the integrand gives $2\\eta - 4\\eta^2 - 2\\eta^3 + 9\\eta^4 - 4\\eta^5 - 4\\eta^6 + 4\\eta^7 - \\eta^8$. Integration yields:\n$$\nI_M = \\left[ \\eta^2 - \\frac{4}{3}\\eta^3 - \\frac{1}{2}\\eta^4 + \\frac{9}{5}\\eta^5 - \\frac{2}{3}\\eta^6 - \\frac{4}{7}\\eta^7 + \\frac{1}{2}\\eta^8 - \\frac{1}{9}\\eta^9 \\right]_0^1 = 1 - \\frac{4}{3} - \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{9}{5} - \\frac{2}{3} - \\frac{4}{7} + \\frac{1}{2} - \\frac{1}{9} = \\frac{37}{315}\n$$\nSubstituting these results back into the momentum integral equation, with $\\nu = \\mu/\\rho$:\n$$\n\\frac{d}{dx} \\left( U_{\\infty}^2 \\delta \\frac{37}{315} \\right) = \\frac{2\\mu U_{\\infty}}{\\rho \\delta} = \\frac{2\\nu U_{\\infty}}{\\delta}\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{37}{315} U_{\\infty}^2 \\frac{d\\delta}{dx} = \\frac{2\\nu U_{\\infty}}{\\delta} \\implies \\delta \\frac{d\\delta}{dx} = \\frac{2 \\times 315}{37} \\frac{\\nu}{U_{\\infty}}\n$$\nIntegrating with the boundary condition $\\delta(0) = 0$ gives\n$$\n\\frac{1}{2}\\delta^2 = \\frac{630}{37} \\frac{\\nu x}{U_{\\infty}} \\implies \\delta^2(x) = \\frac{1260}{37} \\frac{\\nu x}{U_{\\infty}}\n$$\nSo, the hydrodynamic boundary layer thickness is $\\delta(x) = \\sqrt{\\frac{1260}{37} \\frac{\\nu x}{U_{\\infty}}}$.\n\nSecond, we address the thermal field. We must first determine the quartic temperature profile $\\theta(\\eta_t) = (T - T_{\\infty})/(T_w - T_{\\infty})$ with $\\eta_t = y/\\delta_t$. Let the polynomial be $\\theta(\\eta_t) = A + B\\eta_t + C\\eta_t^2 + D\\eta_t^3 + E\\eta_t^4$. The five boundary conditions determine the coefficients:\n1.  $T(y=0) = T_w \\implies \\theta(0) = 1 \\implies A = 1$.\n2.  From the energy equation at the wall with constant properties, $\\partial^2 T/\\partial y^2|_{y=0} = 0 \\implies \\partial^2 \\theta/\\partial \\eta_t^2|_{\\eta_t=0} = 0 \\implies 2C = 0 \\implies C=0$.\n3.  $T(y=\\delta_t) = T_{\\infty} \\implies \\theta(1) = 0 \\implies A+B+C+D+E = 0$.\n4.  Smooth merging requires $\\partial T/\\partial y|_{y=\\delta_t} = 0 \\implies \\partial \\theta/\\partial \\eta_t|_{\\eta_t=1} = 0 \\implies B+2C+3D+4E = 0$.\n5.  Smooth merging also requires $\\partial^2 T/\\partial y^2|_{y=\\delta_t} = 0 \\implies \\partial^2 \\theta/\\partial \\eta_t^2|_{\\eta_t=1} = 0 \\implies 2C+6D+12E=0$.\nSolving this system of linear equations yields $A=1$, $B=-2$, $C=0$, $D=2$, $E=-1$. The temperature profile is:\n$$\n\\theta(\\eta_t) = 1 - 2\\eta_t + 2\\eta_t^3 - \\eta_t^4\n$$\nThe problem specifies $\\mathrm{Pr} = \\nu/\\alpha = 1$. For this specific case, the governing non-dimensional momentum and energy equations are identical, and if their boundary conditions are analogous, their solutions must be related. For $\\mathrm{Pr}=1$, theory predicts $\\delta(x) = \\delta_t(x)$, so $\\eta = \\eta_t$. The velocity profile is $u/U_{\\infty} = 2\\eta - 2\\eta^3 + \\eta^4$. The profile for $1 - \\theta(\\eta)$ is $1 - (1 - 2\\eta + 2\\eta^3 - \\eta^4) = 2\\eta - 2\\eta^3 + \\eta^4$. Thus, we find $u/U_{\\infty} = 1 - \\theta$, a manifestation of the Reynolds analogy. This provides a crucial consistency check.\n\nThe integral energy equation for a flat plate boundary layer is:\n$$\n\\frac{d}{dx} \\int_{0}^{\\delta_t} u (T - T_{\\infty}) \\, dy = \\alpha \\left( -\\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial y} \\right)_{y=0}\n$$\nIn non-dimensional terms, with $\\delta_t = \\delta$ for $\\mathrm{Pr}=1$:\n$$\n\\frac{d}{dx} \\left[ U_{\\infty} (T_w - T_{\\infty}) \\delta \\int_{0}^{1} \\frac{u}{U_{\\infty}} \\theta \\, d\\eta \\right] = \\alpha \\frac{T_w - T_{\\infty}}{\\delta} \\left( -\\frac{d\\theta}{d\\eta} \\right)_{\\eta=0}\n$$\nThe integral $I_E = \\int_{0}^{1} (u/U_{\\infty}) \\theta \\, d\\eta$, because $\\theta = 1 - u/U_{\\infty}$, is identical to the momentum integral $I_M$:\n$$\nI_E = \\int_{0}^{1} \\frac{u}{U_{\\infty}} \\left(1 - \\frac{u}{U_{\\infty}}\\right) d\\eta = I_M = \\frac{37}{315}\n$$\nThe temperature gradient at the wall is $(d\\theta/d\\eta)|_{\\eta=0} = (-2 + 6\\eta^2 - 4\\eta^3)|_{\\eta=0} = -2$.\nThe energy equation simplifies to:\n$$\nU_{\\infty} \\frac{d}{dx} \\left( \\delta \\frac{37}{315} \\right) = \\frac{2\\alpha}{\\delta} \\implies \\delta \\frac{d\\delta}{dx} = \\frac{630}{37} \\frac{\\alpha}{U_{\\infty}}\n$$\nSince $\\mathrm{Pr}=1$, $\\nu=\\alpha$, and this equation is identical to the one derived from the momentum balance, confirming the internal consistency of the model.\n\nFinally, we calculate the local Nusselt number, $\\mathrm{Nu}_x = h_x x/k$. The local heat transfer coefficient $h_x$ is defined by $h_x = q''_{w} / (T_w - T_{\\infty})$, where $q''_{w} = -k(\\partial T/\\partial y)_{y=0}$.\n$$\nq''_{w} = -k \\frac{T_w - T_{\\infty}}{\\delta} \\left( \\frac{d\\theta}{d\\eta} \\right)_{\\eta=0} = -k \\frac{T_w - T_{\\infty}}{\\delta} (-2) = \\frac{2k(T_w - T_{\\infty})}{\\delta}\n$$\nSo, $h_x = 2k/\\delta$. The Nusselt number is:\n$$\n\\mathrm{Nu}_x = \\frac{(2k/\\delta)x}{k} = \\frac{2x}{\\delta}\n$$\nSubstituting the expression for $\\delta(x)$:\n$$\n\\mathrm{Nu}_x = \\frac{2x}{\\sqrt{\\frac{1260}{37} \\frac{\\nu x}{U_{\\infty}}}} = 2x \\sqrt{\\frac{37 U_{\\infty}}{1260 \\nu x}} = 2 \\sqrt{\\frac{37 U_{\\infty} x^2}{1260 \\nu x}} = 2 \\sqrt{\\frac{37}{1260}} \\sqrt{\\frac{U_{\\infty}x}{\\nu}}\n$$\nRecognizing the Reynolds number $\\mathrm{Re}_x = U_{\\infty}x/\\nu$:\n$$\n\\mathrm{Nu}_x = \\left( 2 \\sqrt{\\frac{37}{1260}} \\right) \\mathrm{Re}_x^{1/2} = \\left( \\sqrt{\\frac{4 \\times 37}{1260}} \\right) \\mathrm{Re}_x^{1/2} = \\left( \\sqrt{\\frac{37}{315}} \\right) \\mathrm{Re}_x^{1/2}\n$$\nThe coefficient predicted by this Kármán-Pohlhausen method is $C_{KP} = \\sqrt{37/315} \\approx 0.342724$.\nThe problem provides the similarity solution coefficient for $\\mathrm{Pr}=1$ as $C_{sim} = 0.332$.\n\nThe ratio of the Kármán-Pohlhausen coefficient to the similarity solution coefficient is:\n$$\n\\text{Ratio} = \\frac{C_{KP}}{C_{sim}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{37/315}}{0.332} \\approx \\frac{0.342724}{0.332} \\approx 1.032301\n$$\nRounding to four significant figures, the ratio is $1.032$. This indicates that the chosen quartic profiles yield a reasonably accurate approximation, over-predicting the heat transfer by about $3.2\\%$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{1.032}\n$$", "id": "2495306"}, {"introduction": "While analytical methods often yield local transfer coefficients, engineering applications frequently require average values over an entire surface.

The local Nusselt number at a streamwise location $x$ characterizes the wall-normal gradient of a nondimensional temperature at that $x$ and follows from combining the pointwise constitutive relation at the wall with the definition of a local convective coefficient; it may vary with $x$ even under uniform properties and boundary conditions.**\n\nLet us formalize the statement. We define a dimensionless temperature, $\\theta$, as:\n$$\\theta(x, y) = \\frac{T(x,y) - T_s}{T_\\infty - T_s}$$\nThe wall-normal gradient of temperature can be expressed in terms of $\\theta$:\n$$\\left(\\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial y}\\right)_{y=0} = (T_\\infty - T_s) \\left(\\frac{\\partial \\theta}{\\partial y}\\right)_{y=0}$$\nSubstituting this into the expression for $h_x$:\n$$h_x = \\frac{-k (T_\\infty - T_s) \\left(\\frac{\\partial \\theta}{\\partial y}\\right)_{y=0}}{T_s - T_\\infty} = k \\left(\\frac{\\partial \\theta}{\\partial y}\\right)_{y=0}$$\nNow, we form the local Nusselt number:\n$$\\mathrm{Nu}_x = \\frac{h_x x}{k} = x \\left(\\frac{\\partial \\theta}{\\partial y}\\right)_{y=0}$$\nThis result shows that $\\mathrm{Nu}_x$ is directly proportional to the wall-normal gradient of the dimensionless temperature at the wall. The dimensionless gradient itself, $(\\partial\\theta/\\partial y)_{y=0}$, is a function of $x$. Thus, the local Nusselt number \"characterizes\" this gradient.

For laminar flow over a flat plate, the exact solution of the boundary layer equations yields $\\mathrm{Nu}_x \\propto \\mathrm{Re}_x^{1/2} \\propto x^{1/2}$, where $\\mathrm{Re}_x$ is the local Reynolds number.

The average Nusselt number over $x \\in [0,L]$ equals the arithmetic mean of the local Nusselt number along the plate, i.e., $\\mathrm{Nu}_{L} = \\frac{1}{L}\\int_{0}^{L} \\mathrm{Nu}_{x}\\,\\mathrm{d}x$.**\n\nThis statement makes a specific mathematical claim that must be verified against the definitions. The definition of the average Nusselt number is $\\mathrm{Nu}_L = \\frac{\\bar{h}_L L}{k}$. By substituting the definition of $\\bar{h}_L$, we get:\n$$\\mathrm{Nu}_L = \\frac{L}{k} \\left( \\frac{1}{L} \\int_0^L h_x \\,dx \\right) = \\frac{1}{k} \\int_0^L h_x \\,dx$$\nThe expression proposed in the statement is the spatial average of the local Nusselt number, $\\mathrm{Nu}_x$:\n$$\\frac{1}{L} \\int_0^L \\mathrm{Nu}_x \\,dx = \\frac{1}{L} \\int_0^L \\left( \\frac{h_x x}{k} \\right) \\,dx = \\frac{1}{Lk} \\int_0^L h_x x \\,dx$$\nFor the statement to be correct, the following equality must hold:\n$$\\frac{1}{k} \\int_0^L h_x \\,dx = \\frac{1}{Lk} \\int_0^L h_x x \\,dx$$\nThis simplifies to:\n$$L \\int_0^L h_x \\,dx = \\int_0^L h_x x \\,dx$$\nThis is not a general identity. For the specific case of laminar flow over a flat plate, $h_x = C x^{-1/2}$ for some constant $C$.

This represents a common conceptual error.\n\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**C. The average Nusselt number embodies a global integral energy balance over a control volume (CV) spanning $x \\in [0,L]$ that equates the integrated wall heat input to a net enthalpy flux change of the boundary layer between the leading and trailing edges; it is not determined solely by conditions at $x=L$.**\n\nConsider a control volume enclosing the thermal boundary layer, from the leading edge ($x=0$) to a downstream location ($x=L$), and extending vertically into the free stream. An integral energy balance on this CV states that the total rate of heat transfer from the wall into the fluid, $q'$, must equal the net rate of thermal energy advected out of the control volume.\n$$q' = \\int_0^L q_s''(x) \\,dx = \\int_0^\\infty \\rho u c_p (T-T_\\infty) \\,dy \\bigg|_{x=L}$$\nThe term on the left is the integrated wall heat input. The term on the right is the net enthalpy flux change of the fluid as it passes through the boundary layer, from $x=0$ (where $T=T_\\infty$) to $x=L$.\nThe total heat rate $q'$ is, by definition of the average coefficient $\\bar{h}_L$, given by $q' = \\bar{h}_L A (T_s - T_\\infty)$, where $A=L \\times 1$ is the plate area. The average Nusselt number is defined from this total heat transfer:\n$$\\mathrm{Nu}_L = \\frac{\\bar{h}_L L}{k} = \\frac{(q'/A) L}{k(T_s - T_\\infty)} = \\frac{q'}{k(T_s - T_\\infty)}$$\nSince $\\mathrm{Nu}_L$ is directly proportional to the total heat transfer $q'$, which is the subject of the global integral energy balance, the statement that $\\mathrm{Nu}_L$ \"embodies\" this balance is conceptually correct. Furthermore, because it depends on $q'$, an integral over the entire length $x \\in [0,L]$, it is clearly not determined solely by local conditions at the trailing edge $x=L$.\n\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\n**D. For mass transfer, the local Sherwood number is defined in exact analogy to the local Nusselt number by combining the wall value of Fick’s law with a local mass transfer coefficient, so that it is proportional to the wall-normal gradient of a nondimensional concentration at the wall.**\n\nThe analysis is perfectly analogous to that for heat transfer. The local mass flux of species $A$ at the wall, $j_{A,s}''(x)$, is given by a convective mass transfer law:\n$$j_{A,s}''(x) = \\rho k_{m,x} (Y_{A,s} - Y_{A,\\infty})$$\nwhere $k_{m,x}$ is the local mass transfer coefficient in units of m/s. This same flux is described by Fick's law of diffusion:\n$$j_{A,s}''(x) = -\\rho D \\left(\\frac{\\partial Y_A}{\\partial y}\\right)_{y=0}$$\nEquating these gives:\n$$k_{m,x} = \\frac{-D \\left(\\frac{\\partial Y_A}{\\partial y}\\right)_{y=0}}{Y_{A,s} - Y_{A,\\infty}}$$\nDefine a dimensionless mass fraction, $\\phi$:\n$$\\phi(x,y) = \\frac{Y_A(x,y) - Y_{A,s}}{Y_{A,\\infty} - Y_{A,s}}$$\nFollowing the same steps as in the analysis for Option A, we find:\n$$k_{m,x} = D \\left(\\frac{\\partial \\phi}{\\partial y}\\right)_{y=0}$$\nThe local Sherwood number, $\\mathrm{Sh}_x = \\frac{k_{m,x} x}{D}$, is then:\n$$\\mathrm{Sh}_x = x \\left(\\frac{\\partial \\phi}{\\partial y}\\right)_{y=0}$$\nThe derivation confirms that $\\mathrm{Sh}_x$ is defined by combining the constitutive relation (Fick's law) with the definition of the transfer coefficient, and that it is indeed proportional to the wall-normal gradient of the nondimensional concentration. The analogy to the Nusselt number is exact, provided the governing partial differential equations and boundary conditions have the same form, which they do under the stated problem assumptions.\n\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\n**E. If the local convective heat transfer coefficient $h_{x}$ decreases monotonically with $x$ over $x \\in [0,L]$, then the average Nusselt number $\\mathrm{Nu}_{L}$ over the plate exceeds the local Nusselt number evaluated at $x=L$.**\n\nWe are asked to compare $\\mathrm{Nu}_L = \\frac{\\bar{h}_L L}{k}$ with the local Nusselt number at the end of the plate, which is $\\mathrm{Nu}_x|_{x=L} = \\frac{h_L L}{k}$, where $h_L \\equiv h_x(L)$. The inequality $\\mathrm{Nu}_L > \\mathrm{Nu}_x|_{x=L}$ is equivalent to the inequality $\\bar{h}_L > h_L$.\nThe average coefficient is $\\bar{h}_L = \\frac{1}{L} \\int_0^L h_x \\,dx$.\nWe are given that $h_x$ is a monotonically decreasing function of $x$. This means that for any $x \\in [0, L)$, $h_x > h_L$.\nLet us consider the integral of the difference $(h_x - h_L)$ over the interval $[0,L]$:\n$$\\int_0^L (h_x - h_L) \\,dx = \\int_0^L h_x \\,dx - \\int_0^L h_L \\,dx = (L \\bar{h}_L) - (L h_L)$$\nSince $h_x - h_L > 0$ for all $x \\in [0,L)$ and $h_x - h_L = 0$ at $x=L$, the integrand is non-negative everywhere and positive over almost the entire interval. Therefore, its integral must be strictly positive:\n$$\\int_0^L (h_x - h_L) \\,dx > 0$$\nThis implies $L(\\bar{h}_L - h_L) > 0$. As $L>0$, we must have $\\bar{h}_L - h_L > 0$, or $\\bar{h}_L > h_L$.\nThis confirms that the average coefficient exceeds the local coefficient at the end of the plate. Consequently, $\\mathrm{Nu}_L > \\mathrm{Nu}_x|_{x=L}$.

We may proceed with the solution.\n\nThe problem requires the derivation of the leading-order asymptotic expressions for the thinning ratios $r_{T} \\equiv \\frac{\\delta_{T}^{+}}{\\delta_{v}^{+}}$ and $r_{C} \\equiv \\frac{\\delta_{C}^{+}}{\\delta_{v}^{+}}$ for a turbulent boundary layer. The derivation must be based on the provided transport balances and the specified eddy-viscosity model.\n\nFirst, we must determine the leading-order behavior of the eddy viscosity, $\\nu_{t}$, for small values of the inner coordinate, i.e., in the limit $y^{+} \\ll 1$. The eddy-viscosity model with van Driest damping is given as:\n$$\n\\nu_{t} \\;=\\; \\kappa\\, u_{\\tau}\\, y\\, f_{d}^{2}(y^{+})\n$$\nwhere the damping function is $f_{d}(y^{+}) = 1 - \\exp(-y^{+}/A^{+})$. For $y^{+} \\ll 1$, we can use the Taylor series expansion for the exponential function, $\\exp(-x) \\approx 1 - x$ for small $x$.\nThus, the damping function becomes, to leading order:\n$$\nf_{d}(y^{+}) \\approx 1 - \\left(1 - \\frac{y^{+}}{A^{+}}\\right) = \\frac{y^{+}}{A^{+}}\n$$\nSubstituting this leading-order approximation into the expression for $\\nu_{t}$, along with the definition of the inner coordinate $y = y^{+} \\nu / u_{\\tau}$, we obtain the inner scaling of the eddy viscosity:\n$$\n\\nu_{t} \\approx \\kappa u_{\\tau} \\left(\\frac{y^{+} \\nu}{u_{\\tau}}\\right) \\left(\\frac{y^{+}}{A^{+}}\\right)^{2} = \\frac{\\kappa}{(A^{+})^{2}} \\nu (y^{+})^{3}\n$$\nThis shows that in the region very close to the wall, the eddy viscosity is proportional to the cube of the wall-normal distance, $\\nu_{t} \\propto (y^{+})^{3}$. We can write this scaling relation as $\\nu_{t}(y^{+}) = C_{\\nu} \\nu (y^{+})^{3}$, where the constant $C_{\\nu} = \\kappa/(A^{+})^{2}$ is of order unity, as $\\kappa$ and $A^{+}$ are given to be of order unity.\n\nNext, we determine the thickness of the viscous sublayer, $\\delta_{v}^{+}$. This is defined as the location $y^{+}$ where the turbulent momentum diffusivity, $\\nu_{t}$, becomes comparable to the molecular kinematic viscosity, $\\nu$. We establish this by setting them equal at $y^{+} = \\delta_{v}^{+}$:\n$$\n\\nu_{t}(\\delta_{v}^{+}) = \\nu \\implies C_{\\nu} \\nu (\\delta_{v}^{+})^{3} = \\nu\n$$\nSolving for $\\delta_{v}^{+}$ yields:\n$$\n(\\delta_{v}^{+})^{3} = \\frac{1}{C_{\\nu}} \\implies \\delta_{v}^{+} = C_{\\nu}^{-1/3}\n$$\nSince $C_{\\nu}$ is a constant of order unity, $\\delta_{v}^{+}$ is also a constant of order unity, which is physically consistent with the typical thickness of the viscous sublayer.\n\nNow, we determine the thickness of the thermal diffusive sublayer, $\\delta_{T}^{+}$. This is defined as the location $y^{+}$ where the turbulent thermal diffusivity, $\\alpha_{t}$, is comparable to the molecular thermal diffusivity, $\\alpha$. The condition is $\\alpha_{t}(\\delta_{T}^{+}) = \\alpha$. Using the definitions of the turbulent Prandtl number, $Pr_{t} \\equiv \\nu_{t}/\\alpha_{t}$, and the molecular Prandtl number, $Pr \\equiv \\nu/\\alpha$, we can rewrite the condition in terms of viscosities:\n$$\n\\frac{\\nu_{t}(\\delta_{T}^{+})}{Pr_{t}} = \\frac{\\nu}{Pr}\n$$\nThe problem specifies the asymptotic limit $Pr \\gg 1$. As we will shortly confirm, this implies $\\delta_{T}^{+} \\ll \\delta_{v}^{+}$. Since $\\delta_{v}^{+}$ is of order unity, this means $\\delta_{T}^{+} \\ll 1$. This self-consistently validates the use of the inner scaling for $\\nu_{t}$ (which is valid for $y^{+} \\ll 1$) at the location $y^{+} = \\delta_{T}^{+}$. Substituting $\\nu_{t}(\\delta_{T}^{+}) = C_{\\nu} \\nu (\\delta_{T}^{+})^{3}$:\n$$\n\\frac{C_{\\nu} \\nu (\\delta_{T}^{+})^{3}}{Pr_{t}} = \\frac{\\nu}{Pr}\n$$\nSolving for $\\delta_{T}^{+}$:\n$$\n(\\delta_{T}^{+})^{3} = \\frac{Pr_{t}}{C_{\\nu} Pr} \\implies \\delta_{T}^{+} = C_{\\nu}^{-1/3} \\left(\\frac{Pr_{t}}{Pr}\\right)^{1/3}\n$$\n\nThe procedure for the concentration diffusive sublayer thickness, $\\delta_{C}^{+}$, is entirely analogous. It is defined by the condition $D_{t}(\\delta_{C}^{+}) = D$, where $D_{t}$ and $D$ are the turbulent and molecular mass diffusivities, respectively. Using the definitions of the turbulent Schmidt number, $Sc_{t} \\equiv \\nu_{t}/D_{t}$, and the molecular Schmidt number, $Sc \\equiv \\nu/D$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\nu_{t}(\\delta_{C}^{+})}{Sc_{t}} = \\frac{\\nu}{Sc}\n$$\nThe specified limit $Sc \\gg 1$ implies $\\delta_{C}^{+} \\ll 1$, again justifying the use of the inner scaling for $\\nu_{t}$ at $y^{+} = \\delta_{C}^{+}$. Substituting $\\nu_{t}(\\delta_{C}^{+}) = C_{\\nu} \\nu (\\delta_{C}^{+})^{3}$:\n$$\n\\frac{C_{\\nu} \\nu (\\delta_{C}^{+})^{3}}{Sc_{t}} = \\frac{\\nu}{Sc}\n$$\nSolving for $\\delta_{C}^{+}$:\n$$\n(\\delta_{C}^{+})^{3} = \\frac{Sc_{t}}{C_{\\nu} Sc} \\implies \\delta_{C}^{+} = C_{\\nu}^{-1/3} \\left(\\frac{Sc_{t}}{Sc}\\right)^{1/3}\n$$\n\nFinally, we compute the required thinning ratios by taking the ratio of the derived sublayer thicknesses. The unknown constant $C_{\\nu}$ will cancel.\nThe ratio of the thermal diffusive sublayer thickness to the viscous sublayer thickness is:\n$$\nr_{T} = \\frac{\\delta_{T}^{+}}{\\delta_{v}^{+}} = \\frac{C_{\\nu}^{-1/3} \\left(\\frac{Pr_{t}}{Pr}\\right)^{1/3}}{C_{\\nu}^{-1/3}} = \\left(\\frac{Pr_{t}}{Pr}\\right)^{1/3}\n$$\nThe ratio of the concentration diffusive sublayer thickness to the viscous sublayer thickness is:\n$$\nr_{C} = \\frac{\\delta_{C}^{+}}{\\delta_{v}^{+}} = \\frac{C_{\\nu}^{-1/3} \\left(\\frac{Sc_{t}}{Sc}\\right)^{1/3}}{C_{\\nu}^{-1/3}} = \\left(\\frac{Sc_{t}}{Sc}\\right)^{1/3}\n$$\nThese are the leading-order asymptotic expressions for the thinning ratios. The results correctly show that for high $Pr$ and $Sc$ fluids, the thermal and concentration diffusive sublayers are significantly thinner than the viscous sublayer, with their relative thicknesses scaling with the inverse cube root of these numbers.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} \\left(\\frac{Pr_{t}}{Pr}\\right)^{1/3} & \\left(\\frac{Sc_{t}}{Sc}\\right)^{1/3} \\end{pmatrix}}\n$$", "id": "2495324"}]}
