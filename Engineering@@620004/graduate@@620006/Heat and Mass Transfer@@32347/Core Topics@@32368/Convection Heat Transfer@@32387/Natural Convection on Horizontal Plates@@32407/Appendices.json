The inertia term is thus approximated as $\\rho_{\\infty}\\frac{D\\mathbf{u}}{Dt}$.\n\nIn the continuity equation, $\\frac{\\partial \\rho}{\\partial t}+\\nabla\\cdot(\\rho \\mathbf{u})=0$, substituting $\\rho = \\rho_{\\infty}(1-\\beta(T-T_\\infty))$ leads to\n$\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t}(\\rho_{\\infty}(1-\\beta(T-T_\\infty))) + \\nabla\\cdot(\\rho_{\\infty}(1-\\beta(T-T_\\infty))\\mathbf{u}) = 0$. After simplification and division by $\\rho_\\infty$, this becomes $-\\beta \\frac{DT}{Dt} + (1-\\beta(T-T_\\infty))\\nabla\\cdot\\mathbf{u}=0$. If $\\beta \\Delta T \\ll 1$, then $1-\\beta(T-T_\\infty) \\approx 1$, and if the term $\\beta \\frac{DT}{Dt}$ is also small, the equation simplifies to the classic incompressible form, $\\nabla\\cdot\\mathbf{u}=0$.\n\nHowever, in the body force term $\\rho\\mathbf{g}$, the same substitution yields $\\rho\\mathbf{g} = (\\rho_{\\infty} + \\delta\\rho)\\mathbf{g} = \\rho_{\\infty}\\mathbf{g} + \\delta\\rho\\mathbf{g}$. The first term, $\\rho_{\\infty}\\mathbf{g}$, represents the hydrostatic weight of the fluid at the reference density. This term is balanced by the hydrostatic pressure gradient, $\\nabla p_h = \\rho_{\\infty}\\mathbf{g}$, where $p=p_h+p_m$. The second term, $\\delta\\rho\\mathbf{g} = -\\rho_{\\infty}\\beta(T-T_{\\infty})\\mathbf{g}$, is the buoyancy force. Although $\\delta\\rho$ is small, this force is what drives the entire convective motion and is therefore of leading order, retained in the momentum balance. The approximation hinges on $\\delta\\rho$ being small compared to $\\rho_{\\infty}$, but $\\delta\\rho\\mathbf{g}$ being comparable to other dynamic terms like inertia and viscous forces.\n\nTherefore, the dimensionless parameter controlling the validity of the Boussinesq approximation is $\\beta \\Delta T$.\n\nThe condition $\\beta |T-T_{\\infty}| \\ll 1$ is most stringent where $|T-T_{\\infty}|$ is largest. In this problem, the fluid temperature ranges from $T_{\\infty}$ to $T_s$. The maximum temperature difference, $\\Delta T = T_s-T_\\infty$, occurs at the surface of the hot plate. Consequently, the relative density deviation $|\\rho-\\rho_\\infty|/\\rho_\\infty = \\beta|T-T_\\infty|$ attains its maximum magnitude, $\\beta \\Delta T$, at the plate surface.\n\nNow, we compute the numerical value of this parameter for the given conditions:\n- Isobaric volumetric thermal expansion coefficient, $\\beta = 2.07 \\times 10^{-4}\\ \\mathrm{K}^{-1}$.\n- Plate-to-ambient temperature difference, $\\Delta T = 20\\ \\mathrm{K}$.\n\nThe dimensionless parameter is:\n$$\n\\beta \\Delta T = (2.07 \\times 10^{-4}\\ \\mathrm{K}^{-1}) \\times (20\\ \\mathrm{K}) = 41.4 \\times 10^{-4} = 4.14 \\times 10^{-3}\n$$\nThe value of the parameter is $0.00414$.\n\nFinally, we interpret this result. The value $\\beta \\Delta T \\approx 0.00414$ represents the maximum fractional change in density relative to the ambient density. Specifically, at the plate surface, the density $\\rho_s$ is lower than the ambient density $\\rho_{\\infty}$ by approximately $0.414\\%$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\rho_{\\infty} - \\rho_s}{\\rho_{\\infty}} = \\beta(T_s - T_{\\infty}) = \\beta \\Delta T = 4.14 \\times 10^{-3}\n$$\nThis density variation is very small (significantly less than $1\\%$), which provides strong justification for applying the Boussinesq approximation to model this particular natural convection problem.

The plate temperature is $T_{s}$, with $|T_{s}-T_{\\infty}|=\\Delta T$. Assume constant properties, the Boussinesq approximation (BA), and negligible edge effects such that a single dominant length $L$ characterizes the planform. Consider two orientations: (i) an upward-facing hot plate, $T_{s}>T_{\\infty}$ with the hot surface facing upward; (ii) a downward-facing hot plate, $T_{s}>T_{\\infty}$ with the hot surface facing downward. Define the Rayleigh number based on $L$ as $Ra_{L}=g\\,\\beta\\,\\Delta T\\,L^{3}/(\\nu\\,\\alpha)$, where $g$ is the gravitational acceleration, $\\beta$ is the volumetric thermal expansion coefficient, $\\nu$ is the kinematic viscosity, and $\\alpha$ is the thermal diffusivity, and define the Nusselt number as $Nu=h\\,L/k$, where $h$ is the convective heat transfer coefficient and $k$ is the thermal conductivity of the fluid.\n\nMany empirical correlations in the literature are of the form $Nu=C\\,Ra_{L}^{\\,n}$ and report different exponents $n$ for upward- versus downward-facing plates. Without invoking any empirical correlations, and using only the conservation of mass, momentum, and energy under the BA and standard scale analysis, reason from first principles about the dominant balances that control the thermal boundary layer and the convective motion for each orientation and for different flow regimes. Then decide which option below most correctly explains why different exponents $n$ are reported for the two orientations and coherently relates those reported $n$ values to the underlying flow regimes. Your reasoning should be based on identifiable balances (e.g., buoyancy, viscous diffusion, inertia; conduction versus advection) and, where possible, should recover representative scaling exponents for $n$ in those regimes.\n\nWhich option is most consistent with this first-principles analysis?\n\nA. Upward-facing hot plates produce an unstable density stratification that, beyond onset, self-organizes into buoyant plumes or Rayleigh–Bénard cells whose near-wall thermal layers adjust to a marginal sublayer Rayleigh number, giving $Nu\\sim Ra_{L}^{\\,1/3}$ at sufficiently large $Ra_{L}$, whereas at lower $Ra_{L}$ a laminar boundary-layer balance between buoyancy, viscosity, and thermal diffusion yields $Nu\\sim Ra_{L}^{\\,1/4}$. Downward-facing hot plates are stably stratified, suppressing plume or cell formation so that a weak laminar boundary layer persists; the same buoyancy–viscous–diffusive balance then produces a smaller effective $n$ than the unstable case, consistent with reported exponents at or below $n\\approx 1/4$ (often closer to $n\\approx 1/5$ in some datasets).\n\nB. The exponent $n$ must be identical for upward- and downward-facing plates because gravity affects the problem only through $Ra_{L}$, so orientation cannot alter the $Nu\\sim Ra_{L}^{\\,n}$ dependence.\n\nC. For upward-facing hot plates, buoyancy eliminates the need for thermal diffusion, so $Nu$ grows linearly with $Ra_{L}$ and $n\\approx 1$.

It is **valid**. A solution will be derived based on first principles.\n\n**Derivation from First Principles**\n\nThe physics of natural convection from a horizontal plate is governed by the interplay between buoyancy forces and the stabilizing or destabilizing effect of the density stratification. The direction of the gravitational vector $\\mathbf{g}$ relative to the temperature gradient $\\nabla T$ is paramount. We analyze the two specified orientations using scale analysis of the steady-state conservation equations under the Boussinesq approximation. Let $\\delta_T$ be the thickness of the thermal boundary layer. The Nusselt number scales as $Nu_L \\sim L/\\delta_T$. Our goal is to find how $\\delta_T$ depends on the relevant physical parameters, which are encapsulated in $Ra_L$.\n\n**Case (i): Upward-Facing Hot Plate ($T_s > T_{\\infty}$)**\nIn this configuration, the hot, less dense fluid is situated beneath the cold, denser bulk fluid. This arrangement is **hydrodynamically unstable**. Gravity acts to amplify any small perturbation, leading to the rise of warm fluid and the sinking of cool fluid.\n\n-   **High $Ra_L$ Regime (Turbulent or Cellular Convection):**\n    For sufficiently large $Ra_L$, the boundary layer becomes unstable and breaks down into rising plumes and descending sheets of fluid, or a cellular pattern. The heat transfer is dominated by these vigorous convective motions. A key insight into this turbulent regime is that the thermal boundary layer thickness, $\\delta_T$, no longer depends on the overall plate length $L$. Instead, $\\delta_T$ adjusts itself so that the local Rayleigh number based on this thickness, $Ra_{\\delta_T} = g\\,\\beta\\,\\Delta T\\,\\delta_T^{3}/(\\nu\\,\\alpha)$, remains close to a critical constant value, $Ra_c$, at which the sublayer itself is marginally stable.\n    $$Ra_{\\delta_T} \\sim \\text{constant}$$\n    $$ \\frac{g\\,\\beta\\,\\Delta T\\,\\delta_T^{3}}{\\nu\\,\\alpha} \\sim \\text{constant}$$\n    Solving for $\\delta_T$:\n    $$\\delta_T \\sim \\left( \\frac{\\nu\\,\\alpha}{g\\,\\beta\\,\\Delta T} \\right)^{1/3}$$\n    The Nusselt number is then found by substituting this scaling for $\\delta_T$:\n    $$Nu_L \\sim \\frac{L}{\\delta_T} \\sim L \\left( \\frac{g\\,\\beta\\,\\Delta T}{\\nu\\,\\alpha} \\right)^{1/3} = \\left( \\frac{g\\,\\beta\\,\\Delta T\\,L^3}{\\nu\\,\\alpha} \\right)^{1/3}$$\n    Thus, for the unstable, high-$Ra_L$ regime, we recover the scaling:\n    $$Nu_L \\sim Ra_L^{1/3}$$\n\n-   **Low $Ra_L$ Regime (Laminar Convection):**\n    Below the threshold for strong turbulent convection but above the onset of motion, the flow is laminar. The unstable nature of the stratification still promotes vertical motion. The balance of forces in this regime is typically between buoyancy, viscosity, and thermal diffusion. The scaling for a vertical plate, where buoyancy directly drives the flow against viscous drag in a boundary layer, yields $Nu_L \\sim Ra_L^{1/4}$. Given that the flow for the unstable horizontal plate involves significant vertical fluid exchange, it is plausible to expect a scaling behavior similar to that of a vertical plate. Thus, an exponent of $n=1/4$ is a reasonable expectation for this regime.\n\n**Case (ii): Downward-Facing Hot Plate ($T_s > T_{\\infty}$)**\nIn this configuration, the hot, less dense fluid is situated above the cold, denser bulk fluid. This arrangement is **hydrodynamically stable**. Buoyancy acts to suppress vertical motion and stratify the fluid.\n\n-   **Flow Regime:**\n    The stable stratification prevents the formation of plumes and turbulent breakdown. Convection is not completely absent; the heated fluid layer spreads horizontally outwards from the center towards the edges of the plate, driven by the horizontal pressure gradient induced by buoyancy. This results in a weak, persistent laminar boundary layer over a very wide range of $Ra_L$. The dominant balance is between the pressure gradient, viscous forces, and thermal diffusion. A scale analysis for this situation proceeds as follows:\n    1.  The vertical pressure gradient balances buoyancy: $\\partial p'/\\partial y \\sim \\rho g \\beta \\Delta T$. Across the boundary layer, $p' \\sim \\rho g \\beta \\Delta T \\delta_T$.\n    2.  This creates a horizontal pressure gradient driving the flow: $\\partial p'/\\partial x \\sim p'/L \\sim \\rho g \\beta \\Delta T \\delta_T/L$.\n    3.  This pressure gradient is balanced by viscous shear: $(1/\\rho)\\partial p'/\\partial x \\sim \\nu U/\\delta_T^2$. This yields $U \\sim g \\beta \\Delta T \\delta_T^3 / (\\nu L)$.\n    4.  The energy equation balances horizontal advection with vertical diffusion: $U \\Delta T/L \\sim \\alpha \\Delta T/\\delta_T^2$. This yields $U \\sim \\alpha L/\\delta_T^2$.\n    5.  Equating the two expressions for the characteristic velocity $U$:\n        $$\\frac{g \\beta \\Delta T \\delta_T^3}{\\nu L} \\sim \\frac{\\alpha L}{\\delta_T^2} \\implies \\delta_T^5 \\sim \\frac{\\nu \\alpha L^2}{g \\beta \\Delta T}$$\n    6.  Expressing this in terms of $Ra_L$:\n        $$\\left(\\frac{\\delta_T}{L}\\right)^5 \\sim \\frac{\\nu \\alpha}{g \\beta \\Delta T L^3} = Ra_L^{-1}$$\n        $$\\frac{\\delta_T}{L} \\sim Ra_L^{-1/5}$$\n    7.  Finally, the Nusselt number scaling is:\n        $$Nu_L \\sim \\frac{L}{\\delta_T} \\sim Ra_L^{1/5}$$\n    This exponent $n=1/5$ is smaller than both $n=1/4$ and $n=1/3$, reflecting the less effective heat transfer in the stable configuration.\n\n**Evaluation of Options**\n\n-   **Option A:** This option states that upward-facing plates are unstable, leading to plumes/cells and $Nu \\sim Ra_L^{1/3}$ at high $Ra_L$ due to marginal stability of the sublayer, and a laminar regime with $Nu \\sim Ra_L^{1/4}$ at lower $Ra_L$. It also states that downward-facing plates are stable, resulting in a persistent weak laminar layer with a smaller exponent, like $n \\approx 1/5$. This aligns perfectly with the first-principles derivation. The physical reasoning is sound, and the predicted scaling exponents are correct for their respective regimes. **Correct**.\n\n-   **Option B:** This option claims the exponent $n$ must be identical for both orientations because gravity is only present in $Ra_L$. This is fundamentally incorrect. The orientation of the plate relative to the gravity vector determines the stability of the density stratification. It is precisely the directionality of the buoyancy force that causes the profound physical difference between the two cases. **Incorrect**.\n\n-   **Option C:** This option claims for the upward-facing case that $n \\approx 1$ because buoyancy eliminates the need for diffusion, and for the downward-facing case that $n \\approx 0$ because convection is completely suppressed. Both claims are physically baseless. Diffusion is always necessary at the wall to transfer heat to the fluid, so $n=1$ has no physical origin. Convection in the stable case is weakened, not eliminated, so $Nu$ is not constant ($n \\neq 0$) for $Ra_L > 0$. **Incorrect**.\n\n-   **Option D:** This option incorrectly attributes the difference in $n$ to the plate's thermal conductivity and claims $n \\approx 1/2$ for a perfectly conducting (isothermal) plate in both cases. An isothermal plate is assumed in the problem, so this cannot be the explanation. The primary cause is fluid dynamic stability, not conjugate heat transfer. The exponent $n=1/2$ is not correct for this problem, and the claim that orientation would not matter for an ideal plate is false. **Incorrect**.\n\nBased on a rigorous analysis, Option A provides the only physically consistent and comprehensive explanation for the observed phenomena.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2510711"}, {"introduction": "Scaling analysis is not merely an academic exercise; it is an essential tool for designing robust physical and numerical experiments.

It is a valid scientific problem. I will now provide the solution.\n\n### Solution Derivation and Algorithmic Design\n\nThe solution proceeds in two stages as requested. First, a scaling analysis of the governing equations is performed to derive the characteristic boundary layer thickness, $\\delta$. Second, this result is used to develop a concrete computational algorithm for generating the DNS parameters.\n\n**1. Boundary Layer Scaling Analysis**\n\nWe consider a finite horizontal plate of length $L$ heated to a temperature $T_s$, situated in an ambient fluid at $T_\\infty$. For a downward-facing plate, the fluid below the plate is heated, becomes less dense, and is hydrostatically stable. However, for a finite plate, the pressure difference between the column of light, hot fluid under the plate and the heavier, cold fluid at the sides drives a horizontal flow outward from the center.\n\nLet $x$ be the horizontal (streamwise) coordinate and $y$ be the vertical (wall-normal) coordinate. Let $U$ and $V$ be the characteristic velocities in these directions, respectively. The boundary layer has thickness $\\delta$ and develops over a length $L$.\n\nThe problem postulates that the horizontal motion is driven by a horizontal pressure gradient, $\\partial p/\\partial x$. This gradient arises because the hydrostatic pressure under the column of hot fluid of height $\\sim\\delta$ is lower than that in the surrounding cold fluid. The pressure difference, $\\Delta P_x$, over the horizontal length $L$ is of the order of the buoyancy head:\n$$\n\\Delta P_x \\sim (\\rho_\\infty - \\rho) g \\delta\n$$\nUsing the Boussinesq approximation, $\\rho_\\infty - \\rho \\approx \\rho_\\infty \\beta (T - T_\\infty)$, and taking characteristic temperature difference $\\Delta T = T_s - T_\\infty$, we have:\n$$\n\\Delta P_x \\sim \\rho g \\beta \\Delta T \\delta\n$$\nThe horizontal pressure gradient term in the momentum equation therefore scales as:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{\\rho}\\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial x} \\sim \\frac{\\Delta P_x}{\\rho L} \\sim \\frac{g \\beta \\Delta T \\delta}{L}\n$$\nThe problem asks to balance this pressure gradient with the viscous diffusion of horizontal momentum. In a thin boundary layer where $\\delta \\ll L$, the dominant viscous term is due to shear in the wall-normal direction:\n$$\n\\nu \\nabla^2 u \\sim \\nu \\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial y^2} \\sim \\nu \\frac{U}{\\delta^2}\n$$\nBalancing the pressure and viscous terms gives the first relation:\n$$\n\\frac{g \\beta \\Delta T \\delta}{L} \\sim \\nu \\frac{U}{\\delta^2} \\quad \\implies \\quad U \\sim \\frac{g \\beta \\Delta T \\delta^3}{\\nu L}\n$$\nNext, we perform a scaling analysis of the energy equation. In the boundary layer, heat brought in by advection is balanced by diffusion. The dominant advection term is $u \\partial T/\\partial x$ (or $v \\partial T/\\partial y$, which scales identically under the continuity constraint) and the dominant diffusion term is $\\alpha \\partial^2 T/\\partial y^2$:\n$$\nu\\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial x} \\sim U \\frac{\\Delta T}{L} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\alpha \\frac{\\partial^2 T}{\\partial y^2} \\sim \\alpha \\frac{\\Delta T}{\\delta^2}\n$$\nBalancing these terms gives the second relation for $U$:\n$$\nU \\frac{\\Delta T}{L} \\sim \\alpha \\frac{\\Delta T}{\\delta^2} \\quad \\implies \\quad U \\sim \\frac{\\alpha L}{\\delta^2}\n$$\nEquating the two expressions for the characteristic velocity $U$ yields the relationship for $\\delta$:\n$$\n\\frac{g \\beta \\Delta T \\delta^3}{\\nu L} \\sim \\frac{\\alpha L}{\\delta^2}\n$$\nSolving for $\\delta^5$:\n$$\n\\delta^5 \\sim \\frac{\\nu \\alpha L^2}{g \\beta \\Delta T} = L^5 \\left( \\frac{g \\beta \\Delta T L^3}{\\nu \\alpha} \\right)^{-1} = L^5 Ra^{-1}\n$$\nThis provides the required predictive algebraic relation for the boundary layer thickness. We take the scaling constant to be unity:\n$$\n\\delta = L \\, Ra^{-1/5}\n$$\n\n**2. DNS Setup Algorithm**\n\nFor each given test case, we implement the following computational procedure.\n\n- **Step 1: Compute Physical Properties and $Ra$**. Given the tuple $(L, \\Delta T, \\rho, \\mu, k, c_p, \\beta, g)$, first compute the derived properties $\\nu = \\mu / \\rho$ and $\\alpha = k / (\\rho c_p)$. Then, compute the Rayleigh number $Ra = (g \\beta \\Delta T L^3) / (\\nu \\alpha)$.\n\n- **Step 2: Compute Characteristic Scales**. Using the scaling law derived above, compute the boundary layer thickness $\\delta = L \\, Ra^{-1/5}$. Then, compute the domain axtents $H = 12 \\delta$ and $L_{\\text{dom}} = L + 10 \\delta$.\n\n- **Step 3: Compute Wall-Normal Grid Parameters $(N_y, \\Delta y_1, r)$**.\n  - The first cell height is fixed by the boundary layer resolution requirement: $\\Delta y_1 = \\delta / 48$.\n  - The total height $H$ must be spanned by $N_y$ cells whose heights form a geometric progression: $H = \\sum_{i=1}^{N_y} \\Delta y_1 r^{i-1}$. The sum of a geometric series is $S_{N_y}(r) = \\Delta y_1 (r^{N_y} - 1) / (r - 1)$ for $r \\neq 1$, and $S_{N_y}(1) = N_y \\Delta y_1$.\n  - An interesting consequence of the problem's definitions is that the ratio $H / \\Delta y_1$ is a constant: $H / \\Delta y_1 = (12\\delta) / (\\delta/48) = 12 \\times 48 = 576$.\n  - Therefore, the search for $N_y$ and $r$ is independent of the test case inputs. We must find the smallest integer $N_y \\ge 48$ such that a solution for $r \\in [1, 1.08]$ exists for the equation $(r^{N_y} - 1)/(r - 1) = 576$.\n  - A solution for $r$ exists if the target value $576$ is between the minimum and maximum values of the sum function on the interval $[1, 1.08]$. The function is monotonic. We need to find the smallest $N_y \\ge 48$ satisfying: $N_y \\le 576 \\le (1.08^{N_y} - 1)/(1.08 - 1)$.\n  - The first inequality $N_y \\le 576$ is always true for reasonable $N_y$. The second inequality is the determining factor: $(1.08^{N_y} - 1)/0.08 \\ge 576$, which simplifies to $1.08^{N_y} \\ge 47.08$, or $N_y \\ge \\log_{1.08}(47.08) \\approx 50.048$.\n  - The smallest integer $N_y$ is thus $51$.\n  - With $N_y=51$, we solve $(r^{51} - 1)/(r - 1) = 576$ for $r$ using a bisection method on the interval $[1, 1.08]$ until the sum $S_{51}(r)$ matches $H$ to a relative tolerance of $10^{-6}$.\n\n- **Step 4: Compute Streamwise Grid Parameter $(N_x)$**.\n  - The target streamwise cell size is $\\Delta x_{\\text{tgt}} = \\min(\\delta / 4, L_{\\text{dom}} / 200)$. This choice depends on whether $L < 40\\delta$.\n  - If $L < 40\\delta$, then $\\delta/4 > (L+10\\delta)/200 = L_{dom}/200$. Thus, $\\Delta x_{\\text{tgt}} = L_{\\text{dom}} / 200$ and $N_x = \\lceil L_{\\text{dom}} / (L_{\\text{dom}} / 200) \\rceil = 200$.\n  - If $L \\ge 40\\delta$, then $\\Delta x_{\\text{tgt}} = \\delta / 4$. Thus, $N_x = \\lceil L_{\\text{dom}} / (\\delta / 4) \\rceil = \\lceil (L+10\\delta)/(\\delta/4) \\rceil = \\lceil 4L/\\delta + 40 \\rceil$.\n  - The number of streamwise cells $N_x$ is calculated accordingly.\n\n- **Step 5: Format Output**. All calculated floating-point values ($Ra, \\delta, H, L_{\\text{dom}}, \\Delta y_1, r$) are rounded to six significant figures. The integer values ($N_x, N_y$) are output as is. The results are assembled into the specified list format.\n\nThis structured procedure guarantees a reproducible and physically motivated DNS setup from the given parameters.", "answer": "```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef _round_to_sf(value, sig_figs):\n    \"\"\"\n    Rounds a floating-point number to a specified number of significant figures\n    and returns it as a float.\n    \"\"\"\n    if value == 0:\n        return 0.0\n    return float(f'{value:.{sig_figs-1}e}')\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Main function to solve the problem for the given test cases.\n    It calculates DNS setup parameters based on a scaling analysis\n    of natural convection from a horizontal plate.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Test cases: (L, delta_T, rho, mu, k, c_p, beta, g)\n    test_cases = [\n        # Case A (air, moderate dT)\n        (0.2, 10, 1.177, 1.85e-5, 0.026, 1007, 1/300, 9.81),\n        # Case B (water near 40C)\n        (0.1, 5, 992.0, 6.53e-4, 0.628, 4179.0, 3.5e-4, 9.81),\n        # Case C (air, low dT, larger plate)\n        (0.3, 1, 1.177, 1.85e-5, 0.026, 1007, 1/300, 9.81),\n    ]\n\n    # DNS setup constants\n    C_H = 12.0\n    C_SIDE = 10.0\n    N_BL = 48\n    R_MAX = 1.08\n    REL_TOL = 1e-6\n    MAX_NY_SEARCH = 4096\n\n    all_results = []\n\n    for case in test_cases:\n        L, delta_T, rho, mu, k, c_p, beta, g = case\n\n        # Step 1: Compute Physical Properties and Ra\n        nu = mu / rho\n        alpha = k / (rho * c_p)\n        Ra = (g * beta * delta_T * L**3) / (nu * alpha)\n\n        # Step 2: Compute Characteristic Scales\n        delta = L * Ra**(-1/5)\n        H = C_H * delta\n        L_dom = L + C_SIDE * delta\n\n        # Step 3: Compute Wall-Normal Grid Parameters (Ny, dy1, r)\n        dy1 = delta / N_BL\n        \n        # As derived, H/dy1 is a constant 576.\n        # Find the minimum Ny >= N_BL\n        Ny = N_BL\n        target_sum_ratio = H / dy1 # This is always 576.0\n        \n        while Ny <= MAX_NY_SEARCH:\n            # Check if a solution for r exists in [1, R_MAX]\n            # Max sum ratio is (R_MAX**Ny - 1) / (R_MAX - 1)\n            # Min sum ratio is Ny\n            if Ny == 1.0:\n                max_sum_ratio = Ny\n            else:\n                max_sum_ratio = (R_MAX**Ny - 1) / (R_MAX - 1)\n\n            if target_sum_ratio <= max_sum_ratio:\n                break\n            Ny += 1\n        \n        # Solve for r using bisection\n        low_r, high_r = 1.0, R_MAX\n        r = 1.0\n        \n        # The sum function can be defined based on the target ratio\n        def sum_ratio(r_val, n_val):\n            if r_val == 1.0:\n                return float(n_val)\n            return (r_val**n_val - 1) / (r_val - 1)\n\n        # Bisection loop to find r that satisfies the geometric sum\n        for _ in range(100): # Sufficient iterations for high precision\n            mid_r = (low_r + high_r) / 2\n            current_sum_ratio = sum_ratio(mid_r, Ny)\n            \n            if current_sum_ratio < target_sum_ratio:\n                low_r = mid_r\n            else:\n                high_r = mid_r\n        \n        r = (low_r + high_r) / 2\n        \n        # Final check on tolerance, although bisection guarantees it.\n        # final_sum = dy1 * sum_ratio(r, Ny)\n        # assert abs(final_sum - H) / H <= REL_TOL, \"Bisection failed to converge\"\n        \n        # Step 4: Compute Streamwise Grid Parameter (Nx)\n        # Condition is equivalent to L < 40*delta\n        if L < 40 * delta:\n            dx_tgt = L_dom / 200.0\n        else:\n            dx_tgt = delta / 4.0\n            \n        Nx = int(np.ceil(L_dom / dx_tgt))\n\n        # Step 5: Format Output with 6 significant figures\n        case_results = [\n            _round_to_sf(Ra, 6),\n            _round_to_sf(delta, 6),\n            _round_to_sf(H, 6),\n            _round_to_sf(L_dom, 6),\n            Nx,\n            Ny,\n            _round_to_sf(dy1, 6),\n            _round_to_sf(r, 6),\n        ]\n        all_results.append(case_results)\n\n    # Final print statement in the exact required format\n    # Convert all numbers to strings for the final join\n    output_str = '[' + ','.join([\n        '[' + ','.join(map(str, res)) + ']' for res in all_results\n    ]) + ']'\n    print(output_str)\n\nsolve()\n```", "id": "2510675"}]}
