It presents a canonical problem in the study of internal convective heat transfer: thermally fully developed laminar flow in a circular tube with a constant surface temperature boundary condition. The concepts, definitions, and relationships (Newton's law of cooling, Nusselt number) are standard in the field. The setup is self-contained, objective, and well-posed. The observation that the Nusselt number is constant in this region is a well-established theoretical result (for this specific case, the constant value is $Nu_D = 3.66$). The problem asks for the physical reasoning that reconciles the variation of local heat flux $q''(x)$ and local bulk temperature $T_b(x)$ with a constant local Nusselt number, which is a legitimate and important conceptual question. The problem does not violate any scientific principles, is not ambiguous, and contains all necessary information to be reasoned through.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem statement is valid. A solution will be derived.\n\nThe core of this problem lies in the definition of a thermally fully developed flow under a constant wall temperature boundary condition. This condition is formally stated as the invariance of a dimensionless temperature profile with respect to the axial coordinate, $x$. The appropriate dimensionless temperature is defined as:\n$$\n\\theta(r, x) = \\frac{T(r, x) - T_w}{T_b(x) - T_w}\n$$\nIn the thermally fully developed region, this profile ceases to change with $x$, meaning $\\frac{\\partial \\theta}{\\partial x} = 0$. Thus, $\\theta$ is a function of the radial coordinate $r$ only, i.e., $\\theta = \\theta(r)$.\n\nNow, we analyze the local heat transfer coefficient, $h(x)$. The local heat flux at the wall ($r = R = D/2$) is given by Fourier's law of conduction:\n$$\nq''(x) = -k \\left. \\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial r} \\right|_{r=R}\n$$\nWe can express the temperature field $T(r, x)$ using the dimensionless profile $\\theta(r)$:\n$$\nT(r, x) = T_w + \\theta(r) [T_b(x) - T_w]\n$$\nTaking the partial derivative with respect to $r$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial r} = \\frac{d\\theta}{dr} [T_b(x) - T_w]\n$$\nNote that the partial derivative $\\partial\\theta/\\partial r$ becomes an ordinary derivative $d\\theta/dr$ because $\\theta$ depends only on $r$. Evaluating this at the wall, $r=R$:\n$$\n\\left. \\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial r} \\right|_{r=R} = \\left. \\frac{d\\theta}{dr} \\right|_{r=R} [T_b(x) - T_w]\n$$\nSubstituting this into Fourier's law:\n$$\nq''(x) = -k \\left. \\frac{d\\theta}{dr} \\right|_{r=R} [T_b(x) - T_w] = k \\left( -\\left. \\frac{d\\theta}{dr} \\right|_{r=R} \\right) [T_w - T_b(x)]\n$$\nWe now compare this expression for $q''(x)$ with the definition of the local convective heat transfer coefficient given in the problem, $q''(x) = h(x) [T_w - T_b(x)]$.\n$$\nh(x) [T_w - T_b(x)] = k \\left( -\\left. \\frac{d\\theta}{dr} \\right|_{r=R} \\right) [T_w - T_b(x)]\n$$\nThis comparison reveals that the local heat transfer coefficient is:\n$$\nh(x) = -k \\left. \\frac{d\\theta}{dr} \\right|_{r=R}\n$$\nSince the thermal conductivity $k$ is constant and the term $\\left. \\frac{d\\theta}{dr} \\right|_{r=R}$ is a constant (because $\\theta$ depends only on $r$), the local heat transfer coefficient $h(x)$ must be a constant, independent of $x$. We denote it simply as $h$.\n\nConsequently, the local Nusselt number $Nu(x)$ is also constant:\n$$\nNu(x) = \\frac{h D}{k} = \\frac{\\left( -k \\left. \\frac{d\\theta}{dr} \\right|_{r=R} \\right) D}{k} = -D \\left. \\frac{d\\theta}{dr} \\right|_{r=R} = \\text{constant}\n$$\nThis derivation confirms the observation stated in the problem.\n\nNow, we must consider the axial variation of $T_b(x)$ and $q''(x)$. An energy balance over a differential control volume of the fluid in the tube of length $dx$ gives:\n$$\nd\\dot{Q}_{\\text{conv}} = \\dot{m} c_p dT_b\n$$\nwhere $d\\dot{Q}_{\\text{conv}}$ is the rate of heat transfer from the wall surface area $P dx$ (where $P = \\pi D$ is the perimeter) into the fluid. This is equal to $q''(x) P dx$.\n$$\nq''(x) (\\pi D) dx = \\dot{m} c_p dT_b\n$$\nSubstituting Newton's law of cooling, where we now know $h$ is constant:\n$$\nh [T_w - T_b(x)] (\\pi D) dx = \\dot{m} c_p dT_b\n$$\nThis is a first-order ordinary differential equation describing the change in $T_b(x)$ with $x$. Its solution shows that the temperature difference $[T_w - T_b(x)]$ decays exponentially along the tube length. As heat is transferred to the fluid, $T_b(x)$ increases, approaching $T_w$ asymptotically. Therefore, $T_b(x)$ necessarily varies with $x$.\n\nSince $T_b(x)$ varies with $x$, and we have the relation $q''(x) = h [T_w - T_b(x)]$ with constant $h$ and $T_w$, it is a direct consequence that the local heat flux $q''(x)$ must also vary with $x$. Specifically, as $[T_w - T_b(x)]$ decreases exponentially, so does $q''(x)$.\n\nThe relation $q''(x) = h [T_w - T_b(x)]$ remains self-consistent because the constant of proportionality, $h$, between the local heat flux and the local temperature difference is constant in the thermally fully developed region. The variation in $q''(x)$ is perfectly and linearly coupled to the variation in $[T_w - T_b(x)]$ at every axial location $x$.\n\nNow, we evaluate the given options.\n\nA. In the thermally fully developed region with constant wall temperature, the dimensionless temperature profile is invariant in $x$, so the wall-normal gradient of temperature at the wall scales with $[T_w - T_b(x)]$. With constant properties, $Nu(x)$ constant implies $h(x)$ is constant, and then $q''(x)$ varies only through $[T_w - T_b(x)]$, which decreases downstream as dictated by an axial energy balance coupling $q''(x)$ to $dT_b/dx$. Thus the local relation $q''(x) = h\\,[T_w - T_b(x)]$ holds pointwise while $q''(x)$ and $T_b(x)$ both vary.\nThis statement is a complete and accurate summary of the derivation above. It correctly identifies the invariant dimensionless profile as the starting point, correctly deduces that $h$ is constant, and correctly links the variation of $q''(x)$ and $T_b(x)$ through the axial energy balance. **Correct**.\n\nB. A constant $Nu(x)$ requires a uniform $q''(x)$ along $x$; with $T_w$ fixed, the only way to satisfy $q''(x) = h(x)\\,[T_w - T_b(x)]$ is for $T_b(x)$ to increase linearly so that $h(x)$ and $q''(x)$ both remain constant.\nThis statement is fundamentally flawed. A constant $Nu(x)$ does not require a uniform $q''(x)$. A uniform $q''(x)$ is a different boundary condition, which leads to a constant $Nu_D$ ($4.36$ for laminar flow) but results in a linear increase of both $T_b(x)$ and $T_w(x)$. The problem specifies constant $T_w$, for which $q''(x)$ must vary. **Incorrect**.\n\nC. Because $T_b(x)$ increases downstream under heating, a constant $Nu(x)$ requires $h(x)$ to increase with $x$ to offset the decreasing $[T_w - T_b(x)]$, thereby keeping $q''(x)$ constant and preserving $q''(x) = h(x)\\,[T_w - T_b(x)]$.\nThis statement contains multiple errors. Firstly, a constant $Nu(x)$ with constant properties implies a constant $h(x)$, not an increasing one. Secondly, it incorrectly assumes that the objective is to keep $q''(x)$ constant, which is false for this boundary condition. **Incorrect**.\n\nD. The pointwise relation $q''(x) = h(x)\\,[T_w - T_b(x)]$ is invalid when $q''(x)$ varies with $x$; one must replace $h(x)$ by an axial average to be compatible with a constant $Nu(x)$ in fully developed laminar flow.\nThis statement is incorrect. The relation $q''(x) = h(x)\\,[T_w - T_b(x)]$ is the *definition* of the local heat transfer coefficient $h(x)$. It is valid by definition at every point $x$, regardless of whether quantities vary.

Energy leaves by advection at $x+dx$.\n$$\n\\dot{m} c_p T_b(x) + dq_{\\text{conv}} = \\dot{m} c_p T_b(x+dx)\n$$\nThe convective heat transfer rate from the wall is given by the local heat flux $q''_w$ over the differential area $dA_s = P dx$:\n$$\ndq_{\\text{conv}} = q''_w P dx\n$$\nUsing the Newtonian convective flux relation, $q''_w = h (T_w - T_b(x))$, where $h$ is the local convection heat transfer coefficient.\n$$\ndq_{\\text{conv}} = h P (T_w - T_b(x)) dx\n$$\nSubstituting this into the energy balance gives:\n$$\n\\dot{m} c_p (T_b(x+dx) - T_b(x)) = h P (T_w - T_b(x)) dx\n$$\nDividing by $dx$ and taking the limit as $dx \\to 0$, we obtain the governing ordinary differential equation for $T_b(x)$:\n$$\n\\frac{dT_b}{dx} = \\frac{h P}{\\dot{m} c_p} (T_w - T_b(x))\n$$\nTo solve this equation, let us define a temperature difference variable $\\theta(x) = T_b(x) - T_w$. Then $\\frac{d\\theta}{dx} = \\frac{dT_b}{dx}$. The equation becomes:\n$$\n\\frac{d\\theta}{dx} = -\\frac{h P}{\\dot{m} c_p} \\theta(x)\n$$\nThis is a separable first-order ODE. Since the flow is thermally fully developed, $h$ is constant.\n$$\n\\int_{\\theta_{\\text{in}}}^{\\theta(x)} \\frac{d\\theta'}{\\theta'} = -\\int_0^x \\frac{h P}{\\dot{m} c_p} dx'\n$$\nHere, $\\theta_{\\text{in}} = T_{b,\\text{in}} - T_w$. The integration yields:\n$$\n\\ln\\left(\\frac{\\theta(x)}{\\theta_{\\text{in}}}\\right) = -\\frac{h P x}{\\dot{m} c_p}\n$$\nExponentiating both sides and substituting back for $T_b(x)$:\n$$\n\\frac{T_b(x) - T_w}{T_{b,\\mathrm{in}} - T_w} = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{h P x}{\\dot{m} c_p}\\right)\n$$\nThis is the solution for the bulk mean temperature profile. The outlet temperature $T_{b,\\mathrm{out}}$ is $T_b(L)$:\n$$\nT_{b,\\mathrm{out}} = T_w + (T_{b,\\mathrm{in}} - T_w) \\exp\\left(-\\frac{h P L}{\\dot{m} c_p}\\right)\n$$\nWe need the value of $h$. From the Nusselt number:\n$$\nh = \\frac{Nu_D k}{D} = \\frac{3.66 \\times 0.620\\ \\mathrm{W/(m\\cdot K)}}{6.00 \\times 10^{-3}\\ \\mathrm{m}} = 378.2\\ \\mathrm{W/(m^2\\cdot K)}\n$$\nNow, we compute the argument of the exponential function. The perimeter is $P = \\pi D$.\n$$\n\\frac{h P L}{\\dot{m} c_p} = \\frac{h (\\pi D) L}{\\dot{m} c_p} = \\frac{(378.2)(\\pi \\cdot 6.00 \\times 10^{-3})(5.00)}{(5.00 \\times 10^{-3})(4.180 \\times 10^3)} = \\frac{35.643}{20.9} \\approx 1.7054\n$$\nNow we compute $T_{b,\\mathrm{out}}$:\n$$\nT_{b,\\mathrm{out}} = 350\\ \\mathrm{K} + (300\\ \\mathrm{K} - 350\\ \\mathrm{K}) \\exp(-1.7054) = 350 - 50 \\exp(-1.7054)\n$$\n$$\nT_{b,\\mathrm{out}} \\approx 350 - 50(0.18169) = 350 - 9.0845 = 340.9155\\ \\mathrm{K}\n$$\nRounding to four significant figures, $T_{b,\\mathrm{out}} = 340.9\\ \\mathrm{K}$.\n\nTask 2: Computation of the average wall heat flux $\\overline{q''_w}$.\n(i) By integrating the local wall heat flux $q''_w(x)$:\nThe average heat flux is defined as $\\overline{q''_w} = \\frac{1}{L} \\int_0^L q''_w(x) dx$.\n$$\nq''_w(x) = h(T_w - T_b(x)) = h(T_w - [T_w + (T_{b,\\mathrm{in}} - T_w) \\exp(-\\frac{h P x}{\\dot{m} c_p})]) = h(T_w - T_{b,\\mathrm{in}})\\exp(-\\frac{h P x}{\\dot{m} c_p})\n$$\nThe integral becomes:\n$$\n\\overline{q''_w} = \\frac{1}{L} \\int_0^L h(T_w - T_{b,\\mathrm{in}})\\exp\\left(-\\frac{h P x}{\\dot{m} c_p}\\right) dx\n$$\n$$\n\\overline{q''_w} = \\frac{h(T_w - T_{b,\\mathrm{in}})}{L} \\left[-\\frac{\\dot{m} c_p}{h P} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{h P x}{\\dot{m} c_p}\\right)\\right]_0^L\n$$\n$$\n\\overline{q''_w} = \\frac{\\dot{m} c_p (T_w - T_{b,\\mathrm{in}})}{PL} \\left(1 - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{h P L}{\\dot{m} c_p}\\right)\\right)\n$$\nFrom the solution for $T_{b,\\mathrm{out}}$, we have $\\exp\\left(-\\frac{h P L}{\\dot{m} c_p}\\right) = \\frac{T_{b,\\mathrm{out}} - T_w}{T_{b,\\mathrm{in}} - T_w} = \\frac{T_w - T_{b,\\mathrm{out}}}{T_w - T_{b,\\mathrm{in}}}$.\nSubstituting this into the expression for $\\overline{q''_w}$:\n$$\n\\overline{q''_w} = \\frac{\\dot{m} c_p (T_w - T_{b,\\mathrm{in}})}{PL} \\left(1 - \\frac{T_w - T_{b,\\mathrm{out}}}{T_w - T_{b,\\mathrm{in}}}\\right) = \\frac{\\dot{m} c_p (T_w - T_{b,\\mathrm{in}})}{PL} \\left(\\frac{(T_w - T_{b,\\mathrm{in}}) - (T_w - T_{b,\\mathrm{out}})}{T_w - T_{b,\\mathrm{in}}}\\right)\n$$\n$$\n\\overline{q''_w} = \\frac{\\dot{m} c_p (T_{b,\\mathrm{out}} - T_{b,\\mathrm{in}})}{PL}\n$$\n\n(ii) By dividing the net sensible heat gain by the wetted area:\nThe total rate of heat transfer to the fluid is the net change in its enthalpy, $Q = \\dot{m} c_p (T_{b,\\mathrm{out}} - T_{b,\\mathrm{in}})$.\nThis total heat rate is transferred over the total surface area $A_s = PL$. The average heat flux is by definition $\\overline{q''_w} = \\frac{Q}{A_s}$.\n$$\n\\overline{q''_w} = \\frac{\\dot{m} c_p (T_{b,\\mathrm{out}} - T_{b,\\mathrm{in}})}{PL}\n$$\nThe analytical results from methods (i) and (ii) are identical, as proven. Now, we evaluate the numerical value.\n$$\n\\overline{q''_w} = \\frac{(5.00 \\times 10^{-3}\\ \\mathrm{kg/s})(4.180 \\times 10^3\\ \\mathrm{J/(kg\\cdot K)})(340.9155\\ \\mathrm{K} - 300\\ \\mathrm{K})}{(\\pi \\cdot 6.00 \\times 10^{-3}\\ \\mathrm{m})(5.00\\ \\mathrm{m})}\n$$\n$$\n\\overline{q''_w} = \\frac{(20.9\\ \\mathrm{W/K})(40.9155\\ \\mathrm{K})}{0.03 \\pi\\ \\mathrm{m^2}} = \\frac{855.134\\ \\mathrm{W}}{0.094248\\ \\mathrm{m^2}} \\approx 9073.2\\ \\mathrm{W/m^2}\n$$\nIn the required units and rounded to four significant figures: $\\overline{q''_w} = 9.073\\ \\mathrm{kW/m^2}$.\n\nTask 3: Dimensionless ratio $R$.\nThe ratio $R$ is defined as the value from method (i) divided by the value from method (ii). As we have demonstrated analytically that the expressions derived from both methods are identical, their ratio must be exactly $1$.\n$$\nR = \\frac{\\left(\\overline{q''_w}\\right)_{\\text{method (i)}}}{\\left(\\overline{q''_w}\\right)_{\\text{method (ii)}}} = \\frac{\\frac{\\dot{m} c_p (T_{b,\\mathrm{out}} - T_{b,\\mathrm{in}})}{PL}}{\\frac{\\dot{m} c_p (T_{b,\\mathrm{out}} - T_{b,\\mathrm{in}})}{PL}} = 1\n$$\nThe problem asks for this value to be reported rounded to six significant figures.\n$$\nR = 1.000000\n$$\nThis result is trivial and serves as a consistency check on the theoretical derivation. Any other result would indicate a calculational error or a fundamental misunderstanding of the energy conservation principle.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{1.000000}$$", "id": "2490290"}]}
