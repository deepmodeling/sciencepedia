It contains no contradictions, ambiguities, or factual errors.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem statement is **valid**. A solution will be derived.\n\n### Derivation of Governing Equations and Boundary Conditions\n\nThe derivation starts from the fundamental conservation laws for a Newtonian fluid, incorporating the Boussinesq approximation.\n\n**1. Conservation of Mass (Continuity Equation)**\nThe general continuity equation is $\\frac{\\partial \\rho}{\\partial t} + \\nabla \\cdot (\\rho \\boldsymbol{u}) = 0$. The Boussinesq approximation assumes that density variations are negligible except when they are multiplied by gravity $g$. Thus, for the purpose of mass conservation, the fluid is treated as incompressible with a constant density $\\rho_0$. The continuity equation simplifies to:\n$$ \\nabla \\cdot \\boldsymbol{u} = 0 $$\nIn two-dimensional Cartesian coordinates, this is:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x} + \\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial y} = 0 $$\n\n**2. Conservation of Momentum (Navier-Stokes Equations)**\nThe Navier-Stokes equations for a fluid with constant viscosity $\\mu$ are:\n$$ \\rho \\frac{D\\boldsymbol{u}}{Dt} = -\\nabla P + \\mu \\nabla^2 \\boldsymbol{u} + \\rho \\boldsymbol{g} $$\nwhere $P$ is the thermodynamic pressure and $\\frac{D}{Dt} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t} + \\boldsymbol{u} \\cdot \\nabla$ is the material derivative.\nIn the Boussinesq approximation, the density $\\rho$ in the inertia term (left-hand side) is replaced by the reference density $\\rho_0$. In the gravity term, the full expression for density is used to account for buoyancy.\n$$ \\rho_0 \\frac{D\\boldsymbol{u}}{Dt} = -\\nabla P + \\mu \\nabla^2 \\boldsymbol{u} + \\rho_0 \\left[1 - \\beta\\left(T - T_{\\mathrm{ref}}\\right)\\right] \\boldsymbol{g} $$\nGiven $\\boldsymbol{g} = -g \\hat{\\boldsymbol{j}}$, the gravity term is $\\rho_0 \\left[1 - \\beta\\left(T - T_{\\mathrm{ref}}\\right)\\right](-g \\hat{\\boldsymbol{j}}) = -\\rho_0 g \\hat{\\boldsymbol{j}} + \\rho_0 \\beta g (T - T_{\\mathrm{ref}}) \\hat{\\boldsymbol{j}}$. The equation becomes:\n$$ \\rho_0 \\frac{D\\boldsymbol{u}}{Dt} = -\\nabla P + \\mu \\nabla^2 \\boldsymbol{u} - \\rho_0 g \\hat{\\boldsymbol{j}} + \\rho_0 \\beta g \\left(T - T_{\\mathrm{ref}}\\right) \\hat{\\boldsymbol{j}} $$\nThe problem states that a modified pressure $p$ is used, which absorbs the hydrostatic contribution. The hydrostatic pressure gradient is $\\nabla P_h = \\rho_0 \\boldsymbol{g} = -\\rho_0 g \\hat{\\boldsymbol{j}}$. We define the modified pressure $p$ such that $P = p + P_h$. Then $\\nabla P = \\nabla p + \\nabla P_h = \\nabla p - \\rho_0 g \\hat{\\boldsymbol{j}}$. Substituting this into the momentum equation:\n$$ \\rho_0 \\frac{D\\boldsymbol{u}}{Dt} = -(\\nabla p - \\rho_0 g \\hat{\\boldsymbol{j}}) + \\mu \\nabla^2 \\boldsymbol{u} - \\rho_0 g \\hat{\\boldsymbol{j}} + \\rho_0 \\beta g \\left(T - T_{\\mathrm{ref}}\\right) \\hat{\\boldsymbol{j}} $$\n$$ \\rho_0 \\frac{D\\boldsymbol{u}}{Dt} = -\\nabla p + \\rho_0 g \\hat{\\boldsymbol{j}} + \\mu \\nabla^2 \\boldsymbol{u} - \\rho_0 g \\hat{\\boldsymbol{j}} + \\rho_0 \\beta g \\left(T - T_{\\mathrm{ref}}\\right) \\hat{\\boldsymbol{j}} $$\nThe hydrostatic terms $\\rho_0 g \\hat{\\boldsymbol{j}}$ cancel out, leaving:\n$$ \\rho_0 \\frac{D\\boldsymbol{u}}{Dt} = -\\nabla p + \\mu \\nabla^2 \\boldsymbol{u} + \\rho_0 \\beta g \\left(T - T_{\\mathrm{ref}}\\right) \\hat{\\boldsymbol{j}} $$\nThe term $\\rho_0 \\beta g (T - T_{\\mathrm{ref}}) \\hat{\\boldsymbol{j}}$ is the buoyancy force. Writing this out in $x$ and $y$ components:\n\n$x$-momentum:\n$$ \\rho_0 \\left( \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t} + u \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x} + v \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial y} \\right) = -\\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial x} + \\mu \\left( \\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial x^2} + \\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial y^2} \\right) $$\n\n$y$-momentum:\n$$ \\rho_0 \\left( \\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial t} + u \\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial x} + v \\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial y} \\right) = -\\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial y} + \\mu \\left( \\frac{\\partial^2 v}{\\partial x^2} + \\frac{\\partial^2 v}{\\partial y^2} \\right) + \\rho_0 \\beta g \\left(T - T_{\\mathrm{ref}}\\right) $$\nThe positive sign on the buoyancy term correctly indicates that fluid warmer than the reference ($T > T_{\\mathrm{ref}}$, assuming $\\beta > 0$) will experience an upward force.\n\n**3. Conservation of Energy (Temperature Equation)**\nThe energy equation, neglecting viscous dissipation and other source terms, is:\n$$ \\rho c_p \\frac{DT}{Dt} = \\nabla \\cdot (k \\nabla T) $$\nGiven $k$ and $c_p$ are constant, and applying the Boussinesq approximation ($\\rho \\approx \\rho_0$):\n$$ \\rho_0 c_p \\frac{DT}{Dt} = k \\nabla^2 T $$\nDividing by $\\rho_0 c_p$ gives:\n$$ \\frac{DT}{Dt} = \\frac{k}{\\rho_0 c_p} \\nabla^2 T = \\alpha \\nabla^2 T $$\nwhere $\\alpha = k/(\\rho_0 c_p)$ is the thermal diffusivity. In two-dimensional Cartesian coordinates:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial t} + u \\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial x} + v \\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial y} = \\alpha \\left( \\frac{\\partial^2 T}{\\partial x^2} + \\frac{\\partial^2 T}{\\partial y^2} \\right) $$\n\n**4. Boundary Conditions**\n-   **Velocity:** No-slip ($u=0, v=0$) and impermeable (normal velocity is zero) conditions on all solid walls. This means $u=0$ and $v=0$ on $x=0$, $x=L$, $y=0$, and $y=L$.\n-   **Temperature:**\n    -   At $x=0$: a Dirichlet condition, $T=T_h$.\n    -   At $x=L$: a Dirichlet condition, $T=T_c$.\n    -   At $y=0$ and $y=L$: adiabatic walls. Heat flux normal to the wall is zero. Heat flux is given by Fourier's law, $\\boldsymbol{q} = -k \\nabla T$. The normal to the horizontal walls is in the $y$-direction. Thus, $q_y = -k \\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial y} = 0$. Since $k \\neq 0$, this implies a Neumann condition: $\\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial y} = 0$.\n\n### Evaluation of Options\n\n**Option A:**\n-   Continuity equation: $\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x}+\\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial y}=0$. **Correct.**\n-   $x$-momentum equation: $\\rho_0\\left(\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t}+u\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x}+v\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial y}\\right)=-\\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial x}+\\mu\\left(\\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial x^2}+\\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial y^2}\\right)$. **Correct.**\n-   $y$-momentum equation: $\\rho_0\\left(\\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial t}+u\\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial x}+v\\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial y}\\right)=-\\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial y}+\\mu\\left(\\frac{\\partial^2 v}{\\partial x^2}+\\frac{\\partial^2 v}{\\partial y^2}\\right)+\\rho_0\\beta g\\left(T-T_{\\mathrm{ref}}\\right)$. **Correct.**\n-   Energy equation: $\\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial t}+u\\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial x}+v\\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial y}=\\alpha\\left(\\frac{\\partial^2 T}{\\partial x^2}+\\frac{\\partial^2 T}{\\partial y^2}\\right)$ with $\\alpha=\\frac{k}{\\rho_0 c_p}$. **Correct.**\n-   Boundary conditions: $u=0$, $v=0$ on all walls. At $x=0$: $T=T_h$. At $x=L$: $T=T_c$. At $y=0$ and $y=L$: $\\dfrac{\\partial T}{\\partial y}=0$. **Correct.**\nAll equations and boundary conditions in this option match the derivation. It is entirely correct.\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\n**Option B:**\n-   Continuity equation: $\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}\\left(\\rho u\\right)+\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}\\left(\\rho v\\right)=0$. This is the compressible form and is inconsistent with the Boussinesq approximation, which simplifies this to $\\nabla \\cdot \\boldsymbol{u} = 0$. **Incorrect.**\n-   Momentum and Energy equations: These equations use the variable density $\\rho$ in the inertia term and in the denominator of the thermal diffusivity, which is a violation of the Boussinesq approximation. **Incorrect.**\n-   Boundary conditions: The thermal boundary conditions are swapped: vertical walls are specified as adiabatic and horizontal walls have fixed temperatures. This contradicts the problem statement. **Incorrect.**\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**Option C:**\n-   $y$-momentum equation: The buoyancy term $-\\rho_0\\beta g\\left(T-T_{\\mathrm{ref}}\\right)$ has the wrong sign. For most fluids $\\beta>0$, so a positive temperature difference $T - T_{\\mathrm{ref}} > 0$ should result in an upward (positive) force, not a downward (negative) one. **Incorrect.**\n-   Energy equation: The diffusivity is given as kinematic viscosity $\\nu = \\mu/\\rho_0$ instead of thermal diffusivity $\\alpha=k/(\\rho_0 c_p)$. This is only true if the Prandtl number $Pr = \\nu/\\alpha = 1$, which is not a general condition. This is a fundamental error. **Incorrect.**\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**Option D:**\n-   Continuity equation: $\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x}+\\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial y}=\\beta\\left(\\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial t}+u\\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial x}+v\\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial y}\\right)$. This form is not the standard Boussinesq approximation used in this context, which requires a divergence-free velocity field, $\\nabla \\cdot \\boldsymbol{u} = 0$. **Incorrect.**\n-   $x$-momentum equation: A buoyancy term $\\rho_0\\beta g\\left(T-T_{\\mathrm{ref}}\\right)$ is present. Since gravity acts only in the $y$-direction, there can be no buoyancy force in the $x$-direction. **Incorrect.**\n-   $y$-momentum equation: The term $-\\rho_0 g$ remains, and the temperature-dependent buoyancy term is missing. The formulation is confused, as the modified pressure was intended to remove the hydrostatic components. **Incorrect.**\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\nBased on the rigorous derivation, only Option A presents the correct set of governing equations and boundary conditions for the specified problem.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2491002"}, {"introduction": "The governing equations, in their dimensional form, contain a mixture of physical parameters that can obscure the underlying physics.

The problem is therefore deemed valid and a full solution will be provided.\n\nThe analysis begins with the governing equations for steady, two-dimensional, incompressible flow with a buoyancy term derived from the Boussinesq approximation.

This is precisely the \"emergent dimensionless group that measures the relative strength of buoyancy to viscous diffusion\" requested by the problem.\n$$ Gr_L = \\frac{g \\beta \\Delta T L^3}{\\nu^2} $$\nWe now compute its numerical value using the provided data: $g=9.81\\,\\mathrm{m/s^2}$, $\\beta \\approx 1/T_{\\infty} = 1/300\\,\\mathrm{K^{-1}}$, $\\Delta T=30\\,\\mathrm{K}$, $L=1\\,\\mathrm{m}$, and $\\nu=1.5\\times 10^{-5}\\,\\mathrm{m^2/s}$.\n$$ Gr_L = \\frac{(9.81\\,\\mathrm{m/s^2}) \\left(\\frac{1}{300}\\,\\mathrm{K^{-1}}\\right) (30\\,\\mathrm{K}) (1\\,\\mathrm{m})^3}{(1.5\\times 10^{-5}\\,\\mathrm{m^2/s})^2} $$\n$$ Gr_L = \\frac{9.81 \\times \\frac{30}{300}}{(1.5)^2 \\times 10^{-10}} = \\frac{9.81 \\times 0.1}{2.25 \\times 10^{-10}} = \\frac{0.981}{2.25 \\times 10^{-10}} \\approx 4.36 \\times 10^9 $$\nThe value of the Grashof number is approximately $4.36 \\times 10^9$.\n\nNext, we must assess the state of the boundary layer at $x=L$. The critical parameter for transition from laminar to turbulent flow in natural convection is the Rayleigh number, $Ra_L$, which is a product of the Grashof and Prandtl numbers: $Ra_L = Gr_L \\cdot Pr$. The Prandtl number, $Pr$, is the ratio of momentum diffusivity to thermal diffusivity, $Pr = \\nu/\\alpha$. Thus, the Rayleigh number, $Ra_L = \\frac{g \\beta \\Delta T L^3}{\\nu \\alpha}$, compares the time scale for thermal transport by buoyancy to the time scale for thermal and momentum diffusion.\nUsing our calculated $Gr_L$ and the given $Pr=0.71$:\n$$ Ra_L = (4.36 \\times 10^9) \\times 0.71 \\approx 3.0956 \\times 10^9 $$\nThe problem states a critical Rayleigh number for transition, $Ra_{L,\\mathrm{crit}} = 1.0 \\times 10^9$. We compare our calculated Rayleigh number at the top of the plate ($x=L$) to this critical value:\n$$ Ra_L \\approx 3.10 \\times 10^9 > Ra_{L,\\mathrm{crit}} = 1.0 \\times 10^9 $$\nSince the calculated Rayleigh number exceeds the critical value, the boundary layer flow is expected to be turbulent at the height $x=L$. The flow begins as laminar at the leading edge and undergoes transition to turbulence at a vertical position $x_{\\text{crit}}$ where $Ra_x$ reaches the critical value.\n\nThe final answer should report only the numerical value of the buoyancy-to-viscous dimensionless group, which is the Grashof number $Gr_L$, rounded to three significant figures.\n$Gr_L = 4.36 \\times 10^9$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{4.36 \\times 10^{9}}$$", "id": "2477306"}, {"introduction": "A key skill in advanced fluid mechanics and heat transfer is determining which physical effects are significant and which can be safely neglected.

It is scientifically grounded, describing the well-understood phenomenon of natural convection using the standard Boussinesq-approximated Navier-Stokes equations. The problem is well-posed, with sufficient boundary conditions and physical parameters specified to determine a unique solution. The language is objective and precise. The tasks form a logical sequence of scaling analysis, a standard and rigorous technique in fluid mechanics. All numerical values are physically realistic for air under the specified conditions.

We must compare the magnitude of the viscous dissipation term, $\\Phi$, with the heat conduction term, $k\\nabla^2 T$. The problem specifies scaling in the gap-normal direction, $x$.\n\nThe characteristic length scale in the $x$-direction is the gap width, $H$. The characteristic temperature scale is the plate-to-plate difference, $\\Delta T$.\nThe conduction term is dominated by the second derivative in the narrow gap direction: $k\\nabla^2 T \\sim k\\frac{\\partial^2 T}{\\partial x^2}$.\nUsing the characteristic scales, the magnitude of the conduction term is:\n$$ \\text{Conduction} \\sim k \\frac{\\Delta T}{H^2} $$\nThe viscous dissipation function is $\\Phi = 2\\mu e_{ij}e_{ij}$. For a $2$-dimensional flow $\\mathbf{u} = (u_x, u_z)$, this is $\\Phi = 2\\mu \\left[ \\left(\\frac{\\partial u_x}{\\partial x}\\right)^2 + \\left(\\frac{\\partial u_z}{\\partial z}\\right)^2 + 2\\left(\\frac{1}{2}(\\frac{\\partial u_x}{\\partial z} + \\frac{\\partial u_z}{\\partial x})\\right)^2 \\right]$. In a long, narrow vertical channel, the vertical velocity $u_z$ is much larger than the horizontal velocity $u_x$, and derivatives with respect to the narrow dimension $x$ are much larger than derivatives with respect to the long dimension $z$. Let $U$ be the characteristic vertical velocity. The dominant term in the strain-rate tensor is $\\frac{\\partial u_z}{\\partial x}$.\nThus, the dissipation function scales as:\n$$ \\Phi \\sim \\mu \\left( \\frac{\\partial u_z}{\\partial x} \\right)^2 \\sim \\mu \\frac{U^2}{H^2} $$\nThe ratio of viscous dissipation to heat conduction is then:\n$$ \\frac{\\text{Viscous Dissipation}}{\\text{Heat Conduction}} \\sim \\frac{\\mu \\frac{U^2}{H^2}}{k \\frac{\\Delta T}{H^2}} = \\frac{\\mu U^2}{k \\Delta T} $$\nThis non-dimensional group is the Brinkman number, $Br$. Its physical meaning is the ratio of heat generated by viscous shear forces to heat transported by molecular conduction. When $Br$ is small, viscous heating effects are negligible in the thermal energy balance.\n\nPart $2$: Scaling estimate for the characteristic vertical velocity $U$.\n\nThe characteristic velocity $U$ is obtained from a scaling analysis of the steady, low-Reynolds-number momentum equation:\n$$ \\mathbf{0}=-\\nabla p+\\mu\\nabla^2\\mathbf{u}+\\rho_0 g\\beta\\left(T-T_0\\right)\\hat{\\mathbf{z}} $$\nFor a fully developed flow between infinite vertical plates, the velocity field is purely vertical, $\\mathbf{u} = u_z(x) \\hat{\\mathbf{z}}$, and there is no net flow-driving external pressure gradient. The momentum balance is therefore between the viscous forces and the buoyancy forces. The $z$-component of the equation simplifies to:\n$$ 0 = \\mu \\frac{d^2 u_z}{dx^2} + \\rho_0 g\\beta\\left(T-T_0\\right) $$\nA scaling balance between these two terms gives:\n$$ \\mu \\frac{d^2 u_z}{dx^2} \\sim \\rho_0 g\\beta\\left(T-T_0\\right) $$\nUsing the characteristic scales $U$ for velocity, $H$ for the $x$-direction, and $\\Delta T$ for the temperature difference from the mean, we have:\n$$ \\mu \\frac{U}{H^2} \\sim \\rho_0 g \\beta \\Delta T $$\nSolving for the characteristic velocity $U$ yields the scaling estimate:\n$$ U \\sim \\frac{\\rho_0 g \\beta \\Delta T H^2}{\\mu} $$\n\nPart $3$: Derivation of the threshold gap $H_c$.\n\nThe results from parts $1$ and $2$ are combined.
