It is scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and contains sufficient information for a unique solution. The problem is a standard exercise in applying geometric principles to a fundamental concept in transport phenomena—the hydraulic diameter. We shall now proceed with the derivation.\n\nThe hydraulic diameter, $D_h$, for internal flow through a duct of arbitrary cross-section is defined as:\n$$D_h = \\frac{4A}{P}$$\nwhere $A$ is the cross-sectional area of the flow and $P$ is the wetted perimeter of the cross-section. The problem specifies a long, internally fully wetted duct, so the wetted perimeter is the full perimeter of the regular $n$-gonal cross-section.\n\nOur task is to derive expressions for $A$ and $P$ for a regular $n$-gon whose vertices lie on a circle of circumradius $R$. A regular $n$-gon can be decomposed into $n$ identical isosceles triangles, with the common vertex at the center of the circumscribed circle.\n\nFirst, we determine the cross-sectional area, $A$.\nThe central angle of the circle subtended by each of the $n$ sides of the polygon is $\\frac{2\\pi}{n}$ radians. Each of the $n$ identical isosceles triangles has two sides of length $R$ (the circumradius) and the angle between these sides is $\\frac{2\\pi}{n}$. The area of a single such triangle, which we denote $A_{triangle}$, can be calculated using the formula $\\frac{1}{2}ab\\sin\\theta$.\n$$A_{triangle} = \\frac{1}{2} R^2 \\sin\\left(\\frac{2\\pi}{n}\\right)$$\nThe total area $A$ of the $n$-gon is the sum of the areas of these $n$ triangles:\n$$A = n \\cdot A_{triangle} = \\frac{1}{2} n R^2 \\sin\\left(\\frac{2\\pi}{n}\\right)$$\n\nNext, we determine the wetted perimeter, $P$.\nThe perimeter is the sum of the lengths of the $n$ sides of the polygon. Let the length of one side be $s$. We can find $s$ by considering one of the isosceles triangles described above. By bisecting the central angle $\\frac{2\\pi}{n}$, we form two right-angled triangles. Each right-angled triangle has a hypotenuse of length $R$ and an angle at the center of $\\frac{1}{2} \\left(\\frac{2\\pi}{n}\\right) = \\frac{\\pi}{n}$. The side opposite this angle has length $s/2$.\nFrom basic trigonometry:\n$$\\sin\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{n}\\right) = \\frac{s/2}{R}$$\nSolving for $s$, we find the length of one side of the polygon:\n$$s = 2R \\sin\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{n}\\right)$$\nThe total perimeter $P$ is $n$ times the length of a single side:\n$$P = n \\cdot s = 2nR \\sin\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{n}\\right)$$\n\nNow, we can derive the expression for the hydraulic diameter, $D_h(n,R)$, by substituting the expressions for $A$ and $P$ into its definition:\n$$D_h(n,R) = \\frac{4A}{P} = \\frac{4 \\left(\\frac{1}{2} n R^2 \\sin\\left(\\frac{2\\pi}{n}\\right)\\right)}{2nR \\sin\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{n}\\right)}$$\nTo simplify this expression, we use the trigonometric double-angle identity, $\\sin(2\\theta) = 2\\sin(\\theta)\\cos(\\theta)$, with $\\theta = \\frac{\\pi}{n}$.\n$$\\sin\\left(\\frac{2\\pi}{n}\\right) = 2\\sin\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{n}\\right)\\cos\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{n}\\right)$$\nSubstituting this into the equation for $D_h$:\n$$D_h(n,R) = \\frac{2 n R^2 \\left(2\\sin\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{n}\\right)\\cos\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{n}\\right)\\right)}{2nR \\sin\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{n}\\right)}$$\nWe cancel common terms in the numerator and denominator: $2$, $n$, $R$, and $\\sin\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{n}\\right)$.\n$$D_h(n,R) = 2R \\cos\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{n}\\right)$$\nThis is the explicit expression for the hydraulic diameter as a function of $n$ and $R$.\n\nFinally, we examine the asymptotic limit as $n \\to \\infty$. This corresponds to the polygon approaching a circle.\n$$\\lim_{n\\to\\infty} D_h(n,R) = \\lim_{n\\to\\infty} \\left(2R \\cos\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{n}\\right)\\right)$$\nAs $n \\to \\infty$, the term $\\frac{\\pi}{n} \\to 0$. Since the cosine function is continuous at $0$, we can evaluate the limit:\n$$\\lim_{n\\to\\infty} \\cos\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{n}\\right) = \\cos(0) = 1$$\nTherefore, the limit of the hydraulic diameter is:\n$$\\lim_{n\\to\\infty} D_h(n,R) = 2R \\cdot 1 = 2R$$\nThis result is to be interpreted in the context of a circular duct of radius $R$. For a circular duct, the cross-sectional area is $A_{circ} = \\pi R^2$ and the perimeter is the circumference, $P_{circ} = 2\\pi R$. Its hydraulic diameter is:\n$$D_{h,circ} = \\frac{4A_{circ}}{P_{circ}} = \\frac{4(\\pi R^2)}{2\\pi R} = 2R$$\nThe limit of the hydraulic diameter of the regular $n$-gon as $n \\to \\infty$ is indeed equal to the hydraulic diameter of the circumscribed circle. This provides a rigorous confirmation that as the polygonal cross-section approaches a circular geometry, its hydraulic diameter correctly converges to that of the circular duct.
