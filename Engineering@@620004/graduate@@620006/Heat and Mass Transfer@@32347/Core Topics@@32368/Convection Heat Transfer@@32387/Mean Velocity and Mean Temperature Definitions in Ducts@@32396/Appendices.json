It is a standard exercise in transport phenomena to highlight the distinction between different methods of averaging physical quantities over a non-uniform field. We shall proceed with a formal derivation.\n\nFirst, we must establish expressions for the total mass flow rate and the total convective enthalpy flow rate across the duct's cross-section. The total mass flow rate, denoted $\\dot{m}_{total}$, is the sum of the mass flow rates through each of the two substreams. The mass flow rate through a given area is the integral of the mass flux, $\\rho u$, over that area. For substream $1$ and substream $2$, with uniform properties over their respective areas $A_1 = A/2$ and $A_2 = A/2$, the mass flow rates, $\\dot{m}_1$ and $\\dot{m}_2$, are:\n$$\n\\dot{m}_1 = \\rho u_1 A_1 = \\rho u_1 \\frac{A}{2}\n$$\n$$\n\\dot{m}_2 = \\rho u_2 A_2 = \\rho u_2 \\frac{A}{2}\n$$\nThe total mass flow rate is therefore the sum:\n$$\n\\dot{m}_{total} = \\dot{m}_1 + \\dot{m}_2 = \\rho \\frac{A}{2} (u_1 + u_2)\n$$\n\nNext, we calculate the total convective enthalpy flow rate, $\\dot{H}$, across the area $A$. The enthalpy flow rate is the integral of the enthalpy flux, $\\rho u c_p T$, over the cross-section. The reference state for enthalpy is taken such that the specific enthalpy is $h = c_p T$. The integral is performed over the total area $A$, which consists of two disjoint sub-areas $A_1$ and $A_2$:\n$$\n\\dot{H} = \\int_A \\rho u c_p T \\, \\mathrm{d}A = \\int_{A_1} \\rho u c_p T \\, \\mathrm{d}A + \\int_{A_2} \\rho u c_p T \\, \\mathrm{d}A\n$$\nGiven that all properties are uniform within each substream, the integrands are constant over their respective domains of integration. The calculation is thus simplified:\n$$\n\\dot{H} = (\\rho c_p u_1 T_1) \\int_{A_1} \\mathrm{d}A + (\\rho c_p u_2 T_2) \\int_{A_2} \\mathrm{d}A\n$$\n$$\n\\dot{H} = \\rho c_p u_1 T_1 A_1 + \\rho c_p u_2 T_2 A_2 = \\rho c_p u_1 T_1 \\frac{A}{2} + \\rho c_p u_2 T_2 \\frac{A}{2}\n$$\nFactoring out the common terms, we find:\n$$\n\\dot{H} = \\frac{\\rho c_p A}{2} (u_1 T_1 + u_2 T_2)\n$$\n\nThe problem defines the bulk (or mixing-cup) temperature, $T_b$, via the relation $\\dot{H} = \\dot{m}_{total} c_p T_b$. We can now solve for $T_b$ by substituting our derived expressions for $\\dot{H}$ and $\\dot{m}_{total}$:\n$$\nT_b = \\frac{\\dot{H}}{\\dot{m}_{total} c_p} = \\frac{\\frac{\\rho c_p A}{2} (u_1 T_1 + u_2 T_2)}{(\\rho \\frac{A}{2} (u_1 + u_2)) c_p}\n$$\nCancellation of the common factor $\\frac{\\rho c_p A}{2}$ from the numerator and denominator yields the expression for the bulk temperature:\n$$\nT_b = \\frac{u_1 T_1 + u_2 T_2}{u_1 + u_2}\n$$\nThis is, as expected, the mass-flow-weighted average temperature.\n\nNow, we determine the area-averaged temperature, $\\langle T \\rangle_A$, using its definition:\n$$\n\\langle T \\rangle_A = \\frac{1}{A} \\int_A T \\, \\mathrm{d}A\n$$\nAgain, we split the integral over the two sub-areas $A_1$ and $A_2$:\n$$\n\\langle T \\rangle_A = \\frac{1}{A} \\left( \\int_{A_1} T_1 \\, \\mathrm{d}A + \\int_{A_2} T_2 \\, \\mathrm{d}A \\right)\n$$\nSince $T_1$ and $T_2$ are uniform constants over their respective areas, this becomes:\n$$\n\\langle T \\rangle_A = \\frac{1}{A} (T_1 A_1 + T_2 A_2) = \\frac{1}{A} \\left( T_1 \\frac{A}{2} + T_2 \\frac{A}{2} \\right)\n$$\nFactoring out $\\frac{A}{2}$ and simplifying gives the trivial result for the area-averaged temperature:\n$$\n\\langle T \\rangle_A = \\frac{T_1 + T_2}{2}\n$$\n\nFinally, we compute the required difference, $\\Delta T = T_b - \\langle T \\rangle_A$:\n$$\n\\Delta T = \\frac{u_1 T_1 + u_2 T_2}{u_1 + u_2} - \\frac{T_1 + T_2}{2}\n$$\nTo combine these terms, we use a common denominator of $2(u_1 + u_2)$:\n$$\n\\Delta T = \\frac{2(u_1 T_1 + u_2 T_2) - (T_1 + T_2)(u_1 + u_2)}{2(u_1 + u_2)}\n$$\nWe expand the product in the numerator:\n$$\n(T_1 + T_2)(u_1 + u_2) = u_1 T_1 + u_2 T_1 + u_1 T_2 + u_2 T_2\n$$\nSubstituting this back into the expression for $\\Delta T$:\n$$\n\\Delta T = \\frac{(2u_1 T_1 + 2u_2 T_2) - (u_1 T_1 + u_2 T_1 + u_1 T_2 + u_2 T_2)}{2(u_1 + u_2)}\n$$\nCombining like terms in the numerator:\n$$\n\\text{Numerator} = (2u_1 T_1 - u_1 T_1) + (2u_2 T_2 - u_2 T_2) - u_2 T_1 - u_1 T_2\n$$\n$$\n\\text{Numerator} = u_1 T_1 + u_2 T_2 - u_2 T_1 - u_1 T_2\n$$\nThis expression can be factored by grouping terms with $u_1$ and $u_2$:\n$$\n\\text{Numerator} = u_1(T_1 - T_2) - u_2(T_1 - T_2)\n$$\n$$\n\\text{Numerator} = (u_1 - u_2)(T_1 - T_2)\n$$\nThus, the final expression for the difference in temperatures is:\n$$\n\\Delta T = \\frac{(u_1 - u_2)(T_1 - T_2)}{2(u_1 + u_2)}\n$$\nThis result demonstrates that the bulk temperature and area-averaged temperature are identical only under specific conditions: if the velocities are equal ($u_1 = u_2$) or if the temperatures are equal ($T_1 = T_2$).
