We introduce the similarity variable $\\eta$ and a dimensionless stream function $f(\\eta)$:\n$$ \\eta = y \\sqrt{\\frac{U_{\\infty}}{\\nu x}}, \\quad \\psi(x,y) = \\sqrt{\\nu x U_{\\infty}} f(\\eta) $$\nThe velocity components are derived from the stream function $\\psi$:\n$$ u = \\frac{\\partial \\psi}{\\partial y} = U_{\\infty} f'(\\eta) $$\n$$ v = -\\frac{\\partial \\psi}{\\partial x} = \\frac{1}{2} \\sqrt{\\frac{\\nu U_{\\infty}}{x}} (\\eta f'(\\eta) - f(\\eta)) $$\nwhere the prime denotes differentiation with respect to $\\eta$.\n\nSubstituting these into the momentum equation yields the Blasius equation:\n$$ 2 f''' + f f'' = 0 $$\nThe boundary conditions for velocity transform to:\n$$ f(0) = 0, \\quad f'(0) = 0, \\quad f'(\\infty) = 1 $$\n\nNext, we non-dimensionalize the energy equation using the dimensionless temperature $\\theta(\\eta)$:\n$$ \\theta(\\eta) = \\frac{T(x,y) - T_{\\infty}}{T_w - T_{\\infty}} $$\nThe derivatives of temperature are transformed as:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial x} = (T_w - T_{\\infty}) \\frac{\\partial \\theta}{\\partial \\eta} \\frac{\\partial \\eta}{\\partial x} = (T_w - T_{\\infty}) \\theta' (-\\frac{\\eta}{2x}) $$\n$$ \\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial y} = (T_w - T_{\\infty}) \\frac{\\partial \\theta}{\\partial \\eta} \\frac{\\partial \\eta}{\\partial y} = (T_w - T_{\\infty}) \\theta' \\sqrt{\\frac{U_{\\infty}}{\\nu x}} $$\n$$ \\frac{\\partial^2 T}{\\partial y^2} = (T_w - T_{\\infty}) \\theta'' \\left(\\frac{U_{\\infty}}{\\nu x}\\right) $$\nSubstituting the velocity components and temperature derivatives into the energy equation, we obtain:\n$$ U_{\\infty}f' (T_w-T_{\\infty}) \\theta'(-\\frac{\\eta}{2x}) + \\frac{1}{2}\\sqrt{\\frac{\\nu U_{\\infty}}{x}}(\\eta f' - f)(T_w-T_{\\infty})\\theta'\\sqrt{\\frac{U_{\\infty}}{\\nu x}} = \\alpha (T_w-T_{\\infty})\\theta''\\left(\\frac{U_{\\infty}}{\\nu x}\\right) $$\nAfter canceling terms and simplifying, the equation becomes:\n$$ -\\frac{1}{2} f \\theta' = \\frac{\\alpha}{\\nu} \\theta'' $$\nRearranging using the definition of the Prandtl number, $Pr = \\nu/\\alpha$, we arrive at the ordinary differential equation for the temperature profile:\n$$ 2 \\theta'' + Pr f \\theta' = 0 $$\nThe thermal boundary conditions transform to:\n$$ \\theta(0) = 1, \\quad \\theta(\\infty) = 0 $$\n\nThe problem asks for the ratio of the thermal boundary layer thickness, $\\delta_t$, to the hydrodynamic boundary layer thickness, $\\delta$. From the definition of the similarity variable $\\eta$, the thicknesses are given by:\n$$ \\delta(x) = \\eta_{\\delta} \\sqrt{\\frac{\\nu x}{U_{\\infty}}}, \\quad \\delta_t(x) = \\eta_{\\delta_t} \\sqrt{\\frac{\\nu x}{U_{\\infty}}} $$\nwhere $\\eta_{\\delta}$ is the value of $\\eta$ where $u/U_{\\infty} = f'(\\eta_{\\delta}) = 0.99$, and $\\eta_{\\delta_t}$ is the value of $\\eta$ where $\\theta(\\eta_{\\delta_t}) = 0.01$. The ratio is simply $\\delta_t/\\delta = \\eta_{\\delta_t}/\\eta_{\\delta}$. The value $\\eta_{\\delta}$ is a constant determined from the solution of the Blasius equation, approximately $\\eta_{\\delta} \\approx 5.0$. The value of $\\eta_{\\delta_t}$ depends on the solution to the thermal equation, which includes the parameter $Pr$.\n\nTo find the dependence on $Pr$, we compare the momentum equation ($2f''' + ff'' = 0$) and the energy equation ($2\\theta'' + Pr f \\theta' = 0$). For large $Pr \\gg 1$, the thermal boundary layer is much thinner than the velocity boundary layer ($\\delta_t \\ll \\delta$). Within this thin layer, the velocity profile is nearly linear, and thus the stream function is quadratic. From the Taylor expansion of $f(\\eta)$ about $\\eta=0$, $f(\\eta) = f(0) + f'(0)\\eta + \\frac{1}{2}f''(0)\\eta^2 + ... = \\frac{1}{2}f''(0)\\eta^2$, where $f''(0) \\approx 0.332$ is a known numerical result.\nThe energy equation becomes approximately:\n$$ 2 \\theta'' + Pr \\left(\\frac{f''(0)}{2}\\eta^2\\right) \\theta' \\approx 0 $$\nThe solution to this equation shows that the characteristic width of the temperature profile $\\eta_{\\delta_t}$ scales such that the argument of the exponential term in the solution is of order unity. This leads to the scaling relationship $\\eta_{\\delta_t} \\propto Pr^{-1/3}$.\nAs $\\eta_{\\delta}$ is a constant, we have:\n$$ \\frac{\\delta_t}{\\delta} = \\frac{\\eta_{\\delta_t}}{\\eta_{\\delta}} \\propto Pr^{-1/3} $$\nThis relationship can be more formally established by solving for $\\theta(\\eta)$ and determining the value $\\eta_{\\delta_t}$ from the solution.\n\nFor the special case $Pr=1$, the energy equation becomes $2\\theta'' + f\\theta' = 0$. By inspection, one can verify that if a solution to the Blasius equation is $f'(\\eta)$, then $\\theta(\\eta) = 1 - f'(\\eta)$ is a solution to the energy equation, as $2(-f''') + f(-f'') = -(2f''' + ff'') = 0$. This solution also satisfies the boundary conditions: $\\theta(0) = 1 - f'(0) = 1$, and $\\theta(\\infty) = 1 - f'(\\infty) = 0$.\nGiven this, the definition of the thicknesses leads to:\n$f'(\\eta_{\\delta}) = 0.99$\n$\\theta(\\eta_{\\delta_t}) = 1 - f'(\\eta_{\\delta_t}) = 0.01 \\implies f'(\\eta_{\\delta_t}) = 0.99$\nThus, for $Pr=1$, we find $\\eta_{\\delta_t} = \\eta_{\\delta}$, which means $\\delta_t/\\delta = 1$.\n\nCombining this exact result at $Pr=1$ with the scaling for large $Pr$, it is common practice to approximate the ratio for $Pr \\gtrsim 0.6$ by:\n$$ \\frac{\\delta_t}{\\delta} \\approx Pr^{-1/3} $$\nThis approximation is known to be quite accurate for a wide range of Prandtl numbers.\n\nUsing this relationship, we can estimate the ratio for the given Prandtl numbers.\nFor $Pr=0.7$:\n$$ \\frac{\\delta_t}{\\delta} \\approx (0.7)^{-1/3} \\approx 1.1255 $$\nRounded to three significant figures, this is $1.13$.\n\nFor $Pr=7$:\n$$ \\frac{\\delta_t}{\\delta} \\approx (7)^{-1/3} \\approx 0.5226 $$\nRounded to three significant figures, this is $0.523$.\n\nFinally, we address the qualitative question regarding the magnitude of the wall-normal temperature gradient at the wall, $|\\partial T/\\partial y|_{y=0}$. This gradient is related to the heat flux at the wall.\n$$ \\left. \\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial y} \\right|_{y=0} = (T_w - T_{\\infty}) \\left. \\frac{\\partial \\theta}{\\partial y} \\right|_{y=0} = (T_w - T_{\\infty}) \\theta'(0) \\sqrt{\\frac{U_{\\infty}}{\\nu x}} $$\nThe problem is to compare the magnitude for $Pr=0.7$ and $Pr=7$, holding $(T_w-T_{\\infty})$ fixed. This reduces to comparing the magnitude of the dimensionless temperature gradient at the wall, $|\\theta'(0)|$.\nThe solution for $\\theta(\\eta)$ yields the result that $\\theta'(0)$ is proportional to $Pr^{1/3}$ for $Pr \\gtrsim 0.6$. The exact solution gives:\n$$ \\theta'(0) = - \\frac{1}{\\int_0^{\\infty} \\exp(-Pr \\int_0^{\\eta} \\frac{f(\\xi)}{2} d\\xi) d\\eta} $$\nThis expression clearly shows that as $Pr$ increases, the exponential term decays faster, the denominator decreases, and thus the magnitude $|\\theta'(0)|$ increases.\nTherefore, a larger Prandtl number corresponds to a larger magnitude of the temperature gradient at the wall. This is physically consistent: for larger $Pr$, the thermal boundary layer is thinner ($\\delta_t$ is smaller), so the same temperature difference $(T_w - T_{\\infty})$ is accommodated over a smaller distance, resulting in a steeper (larger magnitude) temperature gradient at the wall.\nConsequently, the case with $Pr=7$ has a larger magnitude of the wall-normal temperature gradient at the wall compared to the case with $Pr=0.7$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n1.13  0.523\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "2486674"}, {"introduction": "While idealized flows are pedagogically useful, real engineering systems often involve a transition from laminar to turbulent flow.

For numerical reproducibility, use the data exactly as provided; do not regenerate or alter them.\n\n- Test Case 1 (Laminar-like data):\n  - $(1000,\\;0.7,\\;9.323)$\n  - $(1000,\\;7.0,\\;20.083)$\n  - $(10000,\\;0.7,\\;29.478)$\n  - $(10000,\\;7.0,\\;63.510)$\n  - $(100000,\\;0.7,\\;93.218)$\n  - $(100000,\\;7.0,\\;200.833)$\n  - $(300000,\\;0.7,\\;161.461)$\n  - $(300000,\\;7.0,\\;347.855)$\n\n- Test Case 2 (Turbulent-like data):\n  - $(500000,\\;0.7,\\;952.430)$\n  - $(500000,\\;7.0,\\;2051.946)$\n  - $(1000000,\\;0.7,\\;1658.303)$\n  - $(1000000,\\;7.0,\\;3572.662)$\n  - $(5000000,\\;0.7,\\;6007.366)$\n  - $(5000000,\\;7.0,\\;12943.257)$\n  - $(10000000,\\;0.7,\\;10463.050)$\n  - $(10000000,\\;7.0,\\;22542.057)$\n\n- Test Case 3 (Mixed laminar–turbulent data across transition):\n  - $(30000,\\;0.7,\\;51.059)$\n  - $(30000,\\;7.0,\\;110.001)$\n  - $(100000,\\;0.7,\\;93.218)$\n  - $(100000,\\;7.0,\\;200.833)$\n  - $(300000,\\;0.7,\\;161.461)$\n  - $(300000,\\;7.0,\\;347.855)$\n  - $(800000,\\;0.7,\\;1385.309)$\n  - $(800000,\\;7.0,\\;2984.596)$\n  - $(1500000,\\;0.7,\\;2294.455)$\n  - $(1500000,\\;7.0,\\;4943.355)$\n\n- Test Case 4 (Identifiability edge case with constant $Pr$):\n  - $(10000,\\;1.0,\\;33.200)$\n  - $(100000,\\;1.0,\\;104.988)$\n  - $(300000,\\;1.0,\\;181.844)$\n\nRequirements:\n- Implement the regression in logarithmic space as described, using ordinary least squares. Use natural logarithms.\n- For each test case, estimate $(A,m,n)$ and report them rounded to three decimal places.\n- Scientific interpretation is part of the analysis: after obtaining $(m,n)$, one should relate $m$ to the streamwise evolution of the hydrodynamic boundary layer thickness and $n$ to the thermal boundary layer–momentum boundary layer coupling. However, your program must output only the numerical results.\n\nFinal output format:\n- Your program should produce a single line of output containing the results as a comma-separated list of lists, in the exact form:\n  - $[[A_1,m_1,n_1],[A_2,m_2,n_2],[A_3,m_3,n_3],[A_4,m_4,n_4]]$\n- Each $A_i$, $m_i$, and $n_i$ must be printed as a decimal rounded to three decimal places.", "solution": "The problem statement is analyzed for validity prior to any attempt at a solution.\n\n### Step 1: Extract Givens\n\n- **Model**: The relationship between the local Nusselt number ($Nu_x$), local Reynolds number ($Re_x$), and Prandtl number ($Pr$) is given by the power-law model: $Nu_x = A \\, Re_x^{m} \\, Pr^{n}$.\n- **Parameters to estimate**: The constants $A$, $m$, and $n$.\n- **Dimensionless Group Definitions**:\n    - $Nu_x \\equiv \\dfrac{h_x \\, x}{k}$\n    - $Re_x \\equiv \\dfrac{\\rho U_\\infty x}{\\mu}$\n    - $Pr \\equiv \\dfrac{c_p \\mu}{k}$\n- **Methodology**: Ordinary least squares (OLS) regression must be applied to the logarithmically transformed model: $\\ln(Nu_x) = \\ln(A) + m \\ln(Re_x) + n \\ln(Pr)$. For cases where a parameter is not identifiable (e.g., constant $Pr$), a minimal-norm least-squares solution is required, which should set the unidentifiable parameter's coefficient ($n$) to $0$.\n- **Data Sets**: Four distinct data sets are provided as lists of tuples $(Re_x, Pr, Nu_x)$:\n    - **Test Case 1**: Eight data points with $Re_x$ from $1000$ to $300000$ and $Pr$ values of $0.7$ and $7.0$.\n    - **Test Case 2**: Eight data points with $Re_x$ from $500000$ to $10000000$ and $Pr$ values of $0.7$ and $7.0$.\n    - **Test Case 3**: Ten data points with $Re_x$ from $30000$ to $1500000$ and $Pr$ values of $0.7$ and $7.0$.\n    - **Test Case 4**: Three data points where $Pr$ is held constant at $1.0$.\n- **Output Requirement**: The final output must be a list of lists $[[A_1,m_1,n_1],[A_2,m_2,n_2],[A_3,m_3,n_3],[A_4,m_4,n_4]]$, with all numerical values rounded to three decimal places.\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\n\n1.  **Scientifically Grounded**: The problem is fundamentally sound. It addresses the determination of empirical correlations for forced convection, a standard topic in heat and mass transfer. The dimensionless groups $Nu_x$, $Re_x$, and $Pr$ are central to the field. The power-law model is a widely accepted form for such correlations in specific flow regimes (laminar, turbulent). The underlying physics is well-established.\n\n2.  **Well-Posed**: The problem is well-posed. It clearly defines the model, the data, and the mathematical procedure (linear regression in log-space) to find a unique solution. It correctly anticipates the issue of collinearity when $Pr$ is constant and prescribes a standard, well-defined resolution: the use of a minimal-norm least-squares solution.\n\n3.  **Objective**: The problem statement is written in precise, objective, and quantitative language. It is free from subjectivity or ambiguity.\n\n4.  **Flaw Checklist**: The problem does not violate any of the specified invalidity criteria. It is scientifically valid, formalizable, complete, feasible, and well-structured. It presents a non-trivial analysis task common in engineering disciplines.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\n\nThe problem statement is **valid**. A solution will be developed as per the specified methodology.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe proposed model is a multiplicative power law:\n$$Nu_x = A \\, Re_x^{m} \\, Pr^{n}$$\nThis non-linear equation can be linearized by taking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n$$\\ln(Nu_x) = \\ln(A) + \\ln(Re_x^m) + \\ln(Pr^n)$$\nUsing the properties of logarithms, we obtain a linear equation:\n$$\\ln(Nu_x) = \\ln(A) + m \\ln(Re_x) + n \\ln(Pr)$$\nThis equation is in the form of a multiple linear regression model. Let us define the variables for the regression:\n- The response variable: $y = \\ln(Nu_x)$\n- The predictor variables: $x_1 = \\ln(Re_x)$ and $x_2 = \\ln(Pr)$\n- The coefficients to be determined: $\\beta_0 = \\ln(A)$, $\\beta_1 = m$, and $\\beta_2 = n$.\n\nThe model can now be written as:\n$$y = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x_1 + \\beta_2 x_2_i$$\nGiven a set of $N$ data points $(Re_{x,i}, Pr_i, Nu_{x,i})$ for $i = 1, \\dots, N$, we can construct a system of linear equations. This system is most conveniently expressed in matrix form:\n$$\\mathbf{y} = \\mathbf{X}\\boldsymbol{\\beta} + \\boldsymbol{\\epsilon}$$\nwhere:\n- $\\mathbf{y}$ is the $N \\times 1$ column vector of observed response values:\n  $$\\mathbf{y} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\ln(Nu_{x,1}) \\\\ \\ln(Nu_{x,2}) \\\\ \\vdots \\\\ \\ln(Nu_{x,N}) \\end{pmatrix}$$\n- $\\mathbf{X}$ is the $N \\times 3$ design matrix, where the first column of ones accounts for the intercept term $\\beta_0$:\n  $$\\mathbf{X} = \\begin{pmatrix}\n  1  \\ln(Re_{x,1})  \\ln(Pr_1) \\\\\n  1  \\ln(Re_{x,2})  \\ln(Pr_2) \\\\\n  \\vdots  \\vdots  \\vdots \\\\\n  1  \\ln(Re_{x,N})  \\ln(Pr_N)\n  \\end{pmatrix}$$\n- $\\boldsymbol{\\beta}$ is the $3 \\times 1$ column vector of coefficients:\n  $$\\boldsymbol{\\beta} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\beta_0 \\\\ \\beta_1 \\\\ \\beta_2 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\ln(A) \\\\ m \\\\ n \\end{pmatrix}$$\n- $\\boldsymbol{\\epsilon}$ is the $N \\times 1$ vector of residuals.\n\nThe goal of ordinary least squares (OLS) is to find the coefficient vector $\\boldsymbol{\\hat{\\beta}}$ that minimizes the sum of the squared residuals, $\\|\\boldsymbol{\\epsilon}\\|^2 = \\|\\mathbf{y} - \\mathbf{X}\\boldsymbol{\\beta}\\|^2$.\n\nWhen the columns of $\\mathbf{X}$ are linearly independent, the matrix $\\mathbf{X}^T \\mathbf{X}$ is invertible, and the unique OLS solution is given by the normal equations:\n$$\\boldsymbol{\\hat{\\beta}} = (\\mathbf{X}^T \\mathbf{X})^{-1} \\mathbf{X}^T \\mathbf{y}$$\nHowever, if the columns of $\\mathbf{X}$ are linearly dependent (a condition known as perfect multicollinearity), $\\mathbf{X}^T \\mathbf{X}$ is singular and cannot be inverted. This occurs in Test Case $4$, where $Pr$ is constant. In this case, the third column of $\\mathbf{X}$ (containing $\\ln(Pr_i)$ values) is a constant, say $c$. This column is therefore a multiple of the first column (which contains all ones), specifically $c$ times the first column.\n\nFor such cases, the problem requires a minimal-norm least-squares solution. This is standardly computed using the pseudoinverse (or Moore-Penrose inverse) of $\\mathbf{X}$, denoted $\\mathbf{X}^+$. The solution is:\n$$\\boldsymbol{\\hat{\\beta}} = \\mathbf{X}^+ \\mathbf{y}$$\nThis provides the solution $\\boldsymbol{\\hat{\\beta}}$ that both minimizes $\\|\\mathbf{y} - \\mathbf{X}\\boldsymbol{\\beta}\\|^2$ and has the smallest possible Euclidean norm $\\|\\boldsymbol{\\hat{\\beta}}\\|$ among all vectors that do. For a rank-deficient system like the one in Test Case $4$, this method correctly identifies the redundant parameter and effectively sets its coefficient to zero, as there is no information in the data to estimate it. In this case, it will yield $n = \\beta_2 = 0$.\n\nThe implementation will utilize `numpy.linalg.lstsq`, which computes precisely this minimal-norm least-squares solution, correctly handling both full-rank and rank-deficient cases.\n\nOnce the coefficient vector $\\boldsymbol{\\hat{\\beta}} = [\\hat{\\beta}_0, \\hat{\\beta}_1, \\hat{\\beta}_2]^T$ is determined for each test case, the original model parameters are recovered as:\n- $m = \\hat{\\beta}_1$\n- $n = \\hat{\\beta}_2$\n- $A = \\exp(\\hat{\\beta}_0)$\n\nThese values will then be rounded to three decimal places as required. The procedure will be applied to all four test cases.", "answer": "[[0.332,0.500,0.333],[0.030,0.800,0.333],[0.076,0.672,0.333],[0.332,0.500,0.000]]", "id": "2486694"}]}
