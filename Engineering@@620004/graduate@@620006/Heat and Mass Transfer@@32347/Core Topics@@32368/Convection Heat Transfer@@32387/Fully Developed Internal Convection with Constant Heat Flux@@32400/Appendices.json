A complete solution will now be derived.\n\nTo derive the axial variation of the bulk mean temperature, $T_b(z)$, we apply the integral form of the steady first law of thermodynamics to a differential control volume. We consider a cylindrical fluid element within the tube of diameter $D$ and differential length $\\mathrm{d}z$.\n\nFor a steady-state system with no internal heat generation and negligible changes in kinetic and potential energy, the energy balance simplifies to $\\dot{E}_{\\mathrm{in}} = \\dot{E}_{\\mathrm{out}}$. The rate of energy transfer into the control volume, $\\dot{E}_{\\mathrm{in}}$, is the sum of the energy advected by the fluid at axial position $z$ and the heat transferred from the tube wall. The rate of energy transfer out, $\\dot{E}_{\\mathrm{out}}$, is the energy advected by the fluid at position $z + \\mathrm{d}z$.\n\nThe advected energy rate at a given cross-section is the enthalpy flow rate, which for an incompressible fluid with constant specific heat is given by $\\dot{m}c_p T_b$. The energy balance is therefore:\n$$ (\\dot{m}c_p T_b)|_z + \\mathrm{d}\\dot{Q}_{\\mathrm{conv}} = (\\dot{m}c_p T_b)|_{z+\\mathrm{d}z} $$\nThe term $\\mathrm{d}\\dot{Q}_{\\mathrm{conv}}$ represents the rate of heat transfer from the wall to the fluid over the differential length $\\mathrm{d}z$. This is given by the product of the constant wall heat flux, $q''$, and the differential surface area, $\\mathrm{d}A_s$. For a circular tube, the perimeter is $P = \\pi D$, so the differential area is $\\mathrm{d}A_s = P\\,\\mathrm{d}z = \\pi D\\,\\mathrm{d}z$. Thus:\n$$ \\mathrm{d}\\dot{Q}_{\\mathrm{conv}} = q'' \\pi D\\,\\mathrm{d}z $$\nSubstituting this into the energy balance equation:\n$$ (\\dot{m}c_p T_b)|_z + q'' \\pi D\\,\\mathrm{d}z = (\\dot{m}c_p T_b)|_{z+\\mathrm{d}z} $$\nRearranging the terms to isolate the differential change in enthalpy flow:\n$$ (\\dot{m}c_p T_b)|_{z+\\mathrm{d}z} - (\\dot{m}c_p T_b)|_z = q'' \\pi D\\,\\mathrm{d}z $$\nDividing by $\\mathrm{d}z$ and taking the limit as $\\mathrm{d}z \\rightarrow 0$ gives the definition of the derivative:\n$$ \\frac{\\mathrm{d}}{\\mathrm{d}z}(\\dot{m}c_p T_b) = q'' \\pi D $$\nSince the mass flow rate $\\dot{m}$ and the specific heat $c_p$ are constant, they can be moved outside the derivative:\n$$ \\dot{m}c_p \\frac{\\mathrm{d}T_b}{\\mathrm{d}z} = q'' \\pi D $$\nSolving for the axial temperature gradient gives:\n$$ \\frac{\\mathrm{d}T_b}{\\mathrm{d}z} = \\frac{q'' \\pi D}{\\dot{m}c_p} $$\nAs $q''$, $D$, $\\dot{m}$, and $c_p$ are all constants, the right-hand side of this equation is a constant. This proves that the bulk mean temperature, $T_b(z)$, varies linearly with the axial coordinate $z$.\n\nTo find the expression for $T_b(z)$, we integrate the differential equation from the inlet ($z=0$, where $T_b(0) = T_{\\mathrm{in}}$) to an arbitrary position $z$:\n$$ \\int_{T_{\\mathrm{in}}}^{T_b(z)} \\mathrm{d}T'_b = \\int_{0}^{z} \\frac{q'' \\pi D}{\\dot{m}c_p} \\mathrm{d}z' $$\nwhere $T'_b$ and $z'$ are dummy variables of integration. The integration yields:\n$$ T_b(z) - T_{\\mathrm{in}} = \\frac{q'' \\pi D z}{\\dot{m}c_p} $$\nThe axial temperature distribution is therefore:\n$$ T_b(z) = T_{\\mathrm{in}} + \\frac{q'' \\pi D z}{\\dot{m}c_p} $$\nTo find the outlet bulk mean temperature, $T_b(L)$, we evaluate this expression at $z=L$:\n$$ T_b(L) = T_{\\mathrm{in}} + \\frac{q'' \\pi D L}{\\dot{m}c_p} $$\nNow, we substitute the provided numerical values into this equation: $T_{\\mathrm{in}} = 300.0\\ \\mathrm{K}$, $q'' = 8000\\ \\mathrm{W/m^2}$, $D = 0.020\\ \\mathrm{m}$, $L = 8.00\\ \\mathrm{m}$, $\\dot{m} = 0.200\\ \\mathrm{kg/s}$, and $c_p = 4180\\ \\mathrm{J/(kg\\cdot K)}$.\n$$ T_b(L) = 300.0 + \\frac{(8000) \\cdot \\pi \\cdot (0.020) \\cdot (8.00)}{(0.200) \\cdot (4180)} $$\nFirst, we compute the total heat transfer rate into the fluid, $\\dot{Q} = q'' (\\pi D L)$:\n$$ \\dot{Q} = (8000) \\cdot \\pi \\cdot (0.020) \\cdot (8.00) = 1280 \\pi \\ \\mathrm{W} \\approx 4021.24\\ \\mathrm{W} $$\nNext, we compute the denominator, $\\dot{m}c_p$:\n$$ \\dot{m}c_p = (0.200) \\cdot (4180) = 836\\ \\mathrm{J/(s \\cdot K)} = 836\\ \\mathrm{W/K} $$\nThe temperature increase is the ratio of these two quantities:\n$$ \\Delta T_b = \\frac{1280 \\pi}{836} \\approx 4.810094\\ \\mathrm{K} $$\nFinally, the outlet temperature is:\n$$ T_b(L) = 300.0 + 4.810094 = 304.810094\\ \\mathrm{K} $$\nAs per the problem instruction, the final answer must be rounded to four significant figures.\n$$ T_b(L) \\approx 304.8\\ \\mathrm{K} $$", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{304.8}\n$$", "id": "2490099"}, {"introduction": "Having established how the bulk temperature evolves, we now explore the temperature distribution within the fluid itself to determine the heat transfer coefficient.

A key consequence of this condition is that the axial temperature gradient, $\\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial x}$, is constant across the tube's cross-section and along the axial direction.

These are standard concepts in engineering heat transfer. The problem is free of any pseudoscience or factual unsoundness.\n- **Well-Posed**: The problem is well-posed. For each test case, a complete set of input parameters is provided. The sequence of prescribed equations forms a determinate system that yields a unique solution for the requested output quantities ($\\mathrm{Nu}$, $\\mathrm{d}T_b/\\mathrm{d}x$, $T_w - T_b$).\n- **Objective**: The problem is stated using precise, objective, and unambiguous technical language. There are no subjective or opinion-based claims.\n- **Complete and Consistent**: The problem is self-contained. All necessary data and governing equations are explicitly provided. The assumption of turbulent flow is consistent with the Reynolds numbers calculated from the given data, which are all greater than the typical transition value of approximately $2300$. The Petukhov correlation is applicable for the calculated Reynolds numbers.\n- **Realistic and Feasible**: The fluid properties and operating conditions are physically realistic for the specified fluids (air, water, oil, supercritical fluid). The problem does not present any scientifically implausible or physically impossible scenarios.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem statement is **valid**. It is a standard, well-defined problem in convective heat transfer. The solution will proceed as instructed.\n\n**Derivation and Solution Methodology**\nThe derivation must follow from the principles and correlations provided.\n\n1.  **Bulk Temperature Axial Gradient ($\\mathrm{d}T_b/\\mathrm{d}x$)**\n    This quantity is derived from an energy balance on a differential control volume of the fluid of length $\\mathrm{d}x$ along the tube axis. For steady state, the rate of energy advected out minus the rate of energy advected in must equal the rate of heat added through the wall.\n    $$ \\dot{m} c_p T_b \\rvert_{x+\\mathrm{d}x} - \\dot{m} c_p T_b \\rvert_x = \\mathrm{d}q_{conv} $$\n    where $\\dot{m}$ is the mass flow rate and $\\mathrm{d}q_{conv}$ is the heat transferred from the wall over the differential area $\\mathrm{d}A_s = P \\mathrm{d}x$. With a constant heat flux $q''$, this is $\\mathrm{d}q_{conv} = q'' P \\mathrm{d}x$. The left side can be written as $\\dot{m} c_p (\\mathrm{d}T_b/\\mathrm{d}x) \\mathrm{d}x$.\n    $$ \\dot{m} c_p \\frac{\\mathrm{d}T_b}{\\mathrm{d}x} \\mathrm{d}x = q'' P \\mathrm{d}x $$\n    This simplifies to:\n    $$ \\frac{\\mathrm{d}T_b}{\\mathrm{d}x} = \\frac{q'' P}{\\dot{m} c_p} $$\n    The mass flow rate is $\\dot{m} = \\rho u_m A$. Substituting for the pipe geometry, $P=\\pi D$ and $A = \\pi D^2/4$:\n    $$ \\frac{\\mathrm{d}T_b}{\\mathrm{d}x} = \\frac{q'' (\\pi D)}{(\\rho u_m \\frac{\\pi D^2}{4}) c_p} = \\frac{4 q''}{\\rho u_m c_p D} $$\n    This expression allows direct calculation of the bulk temperature gradient from the given parameters. The linear increase of bulk temperature with axial position is a characteristic feature of fully developed flow with a constant heat flux boundary condition.\n\n2.  **Heat Transfer Coefficient ($h$) and Nusselt Number ($\\mathrm{Nu}$)**\n    The heat transfer coefficient $h$ must be determined to find the wall temperature. The problem specifies a procedure based on the Reynolds analogy, specifically the Colburn $j$-factor.\n    - First, the dimensionless Reynolds number ($\\mathrm{Re}$) and Prandtl number ($\\mathrm{Pr}$) are computed:\n      $$ \\mathrm{Re} = \\frac{\\rho u_m D}{\\mu} \\quad ; \\quad \\mathrm{Pr} = \\frac{\\mu c_p}{k} $$\n    - Next, the Darcy friction factor $f$ for turbulent flow in a smooth tube is calculated using the Petukhov correlation:\n      $$ f = (0.790 \\ln \\mathrm{Re} - 1.64)^{-2} $$\n    - The Colburn $j$-factor analogy, $j_H = f/2$, is used to relate momentum and heat transfer. The Stanton number ($\\mathrm{St}$) is then found from its definition in terms of the $j$-factor:\n      $$ \\mathrm{St} = \\frac{j_H}{\\mathrm{Pr}^{2/3}} = \\frac{f/2}{\\mathrm{Pr}^{2/3}} $$\n    - The heat transfer coefficient $h$ is then determined from the definition of the Stanton number, $\\mathrm{St} = h / (\\rho c_p u_m)$:\n      $$ h = \\mathrm{St} \\cdot \\rho c_p u_m $$\n    - Finally, the dimensionless Nusselt number ($\\mathrm{Nu}$) is calculated from its definition:\n      $$ \\mathrm{Nu} = \\frac{h D}{k} $$\n    It is useful to note that $\\mathrm{Nu}$ can also be expressed as $\\mathrm{Nu} = \\mathrm{Re} \\cdot \\mathrm{Pr} \\cdot \\mathrm{St}$.\n\n3.  **Wall-to-Bulk Temperature Difference ($T_w - T_b$)**\n    This temperature difference is defined by the local heat flux $q''$ and the heat transfer coefficient $h$ via Newton's law of cooling, as given in the problem statement:\n    $$ q'' = h (T_w - T_b) $$\n    For fully developed flow with constant $q''$ and constant properties, $h$ is constant along the tube. Therefore, the temperature difference $T_w - T_b$ is also constant along the axial direction.\n    $$ T_w - T_b = \\frac{q''}{h} $$\n\n**Computational Algorithm**\nFor each test case, defined by the tuple $(D, u_m, \\rho, \\mu, c_p, k, q'')$, the following computational sequence is executed:\n1.  Calculate $\\mathrm{Re} = \\frac{\\rho u_m D}{\\mu}$.\n2.  Calculate $\\mathrm{Pr} = \\frac{\\mu c_p}{k}$.\n3.  Calculate $f = (0.790 \\ln \\mathrm{Re} - 1.64)^{-2}$.\n4.  Calculate $\\mathrm{St} = \\frac{f/2}{\\mathrm{Pr}^{2/3}}$.\n5.  Calculate $h = \\mathrm{St} \\cdot \\rho c_p u_m$.\n6.  Calculate the three required output quantities:\n    - $\\mathrm{Nu} = \\frac{h D}{k}$\n    - $\\frac{\\mathrm{d}T_b}{\\mathrm{d}x} = \\frac{4 q''}{\\rho u_m c_p D}$\n    - $T_w - T_b = \\frac{q''}{h}$\n7.  The results $[\\mathrm{Nu}, \\mathrm{d}T_b/\\mathrm{d}x, T_w-T_b]$ are collected for each case and formatted as specified.
