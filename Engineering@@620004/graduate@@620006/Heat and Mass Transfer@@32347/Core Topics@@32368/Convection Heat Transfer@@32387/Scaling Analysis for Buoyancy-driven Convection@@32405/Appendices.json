It represents a canonical problem in heat transfer theory amenable to scaling analysis. We shall proceed with the derivation.\n\nThe analysis begins with the governing equations for steady, two-dimensional, incompressible flow under the Oberbeck-Boussinesq approximation. Let $x$ be the coordinate normal to the hot wall and $y$ be the coordinate parallel to it (streamwise direction). The corresponding velocity components are $u$ and $v$.

The characteristic length scales are the boundary layer thickness $\\delta_T$ in the wall-normal direction and the cavity height $H$ in the streamwise direction. By definition of a boundary layer, $\\delta_T \\ll H$. Let $U$ be the characteristic vertical velocity within this layer.\n\nFrom the continuity equation, we establish the scale for the wall-normal velocity, $V$.\n$$\n\\frac{V}{\\delta_T} \\sim \\frac{U}{H} \\implies V \\sim U \\frac{\\delta_T}{H}\n$$\n\nNext, we scale the energy equation.

Let $T_{\\text{ref}}$ be a reference temperature.\n\nContinuity:\n$$ \\nabla \\cdot \\boldsymbol{u} = 0 $$\n\nMomentum:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial \\boldsymbol{u}}{\\partial t} + \\boldsymbol{u} \\cdot \\nabla \\boldsymbol{u} = -\\frac{1}{\\rho} \\nabla p' + \\nu \\nabla^2 \\boldsymbol{u} + \\boldsymbol{g} \\beta (T - T_{\\text{ref}}) $$\nHere, $p'$ is the dynamic pressure, which is the total pressure minus the hydrostatic part corresponding to density $\\rho$ at $T_{\\text{ref}}$.\n\nEnergy:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial t} + \\boldsymbol{u} \\cdot \\nabla T = \\alpha \\nabla^2 T $$\n\nWe introduce the following nondimensional variables, using the characteristic scales $L$, $U$, and $\\Delta T$:\n$$ \\boldsymbol{x}^* = \\frac{\\boldsymbol{x}}{L}, \\quad \\boldsymbol{u}^* = \\frac{\\boldsymbol{u}}{U}, \\quad t^* = \\frac{t}{L/U}, \\quad \\theta = \\frac{T - T_{\\text{ref}}}{\\Delta T}, \\quad p'^* = \\frac{p'}{\\rho U^2} $$\n\nSubstituting these into the momentum equation yields:\n$$ \\frac{U^2}{L} \\frac{\\partial \\boldsymbol{u}^*}{\\partial t^*} + \\frac{U^2}{L} (\\boldsymbol{u}^* \\cdot \\nabla^*) \\boldsymbol{u}^* = -\\frac{\\rho U^2}{\\rho L} \\nabla^* p'^* + \\frac{\\nu U}{L^2} \\nabla^{*2} \\boldsymbol{u}^* + \\boldsymbol{g} \\beta \\Delta T \\theta $$\nDividing all terms by the characteristic acceleration of the inertial term, $U^2/L$, we obtain the nondimensional momentum equation:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial \\boldsymbol{u}^*}{\\partial t^*} + (\\boldsymbol{u}^* \\cdot \\nabla^*) \\boldsymbol{u}^* = -\\nabla^* p'^* + \\left(\\frac{\\nu}{UL}\\right) \\nabla^{*2} \\boldsymbol{u}^* + \\left(\\frac{g \\beta \\Delta T L}{U^2}\\right) \\theta \\hat{\\boldsymbol{g}} $$\nwhere $\\hat{\\boldsymbol{g}} = \\boldsymbol{g} / g$.\nThe two nondimensional groups that appear are:\n1.  The coefficient of the viscous term is the reciprocal of the Reynolds number: $\\frac{\\nu}{UL} = \\frac{1}{\\mathrm{Re}}$, where $\\mathrm{Re} = \\frac{UL}{\\nu}$.\n2.  The coefficient of the buoyancy term is related to the Grashof number, $\\mathrm{Gr} = \\frac{g \\beta \\Delta T L^3}{\\nu^2}$. We can write the coefficient as $\\frac{g \\beta \\Delta T L}{U^2} = \\frac{g \\beta \\Delta T L^3}{\\nu^2} \\cdot \\frac{\\nu^2}{U^2 L^2} = \\mathrm{Gr} \\left(\\frac{\\nu}{UL}\\right)^2 = \\frac{\\mathrm{Gr}}{\\mathrm{Re}^2}$.\n\nThe final nondimensional momentum equation is:\n$$ \\underbrace{\\frac{\\partial \\boldsymbol{u}^*}{\\partial t^*} + (\\boldsymbol{u}^* \\cdot \\nabla^*) \\boldsymbol{u}^*}_{\\text{Inertia, } \\mathcal{O}(1)} = -\\nabla^* p'^* + \\underbrace{\\frac{1}{\\mathrm{Re}} \\nabla^{*2} \\boldsymbol{u}^*}_{\\text{Viscous}} + \\underbrace{\\frac{\\mathrm{Gr}}{\\mathrm{Re}^2} \\theta \\hat{\\boldsymbol{g}}}_{\\text{Buoyancy}} $$\n\nSimilarly, for the energy equation:\n$$ \\frac{U \\Delta T}{L} \\frac{\\partial \\theta}{\\partial t^*} + \\frac{U \\Delta T}{L} (\\boldsymbol{u}^* \\cdot \\nabla^*) \\theta = \\frac{\\alpha \\Delta T}{L^2} \\nabla^{*2} \\theta $$\nDividing by $U \\Delta T / L$:\n$$ \\underbrace{\\frac{\\partial \\theta}{\\partial t^*} + (\\boldsymbol{u}^* \\cdot \\nabla^*) \\theta}_{\\text{Advection, } \\mathcal{O}(1)} = \\left(\\frac{\\alpha}{UL}\\right) \\nabla^{*2} \\theta $$\nThe coefficient of the thermal diffusion term is the reciprocal of the Péclet number: $\\frac{\\alpha}{UL} = \\frac{1}{\\mathrm{Pe}}$. The Péclet number is related to the Reynolds and Prandtl numbers: $\\mathrm{Pe} = \\frac{UL}{\\alpha} = \\frac{UL}{\\nu} \\frac{\\nu}{\\alpha} = \\mathrm{Re} \\cdot \\mathrm{Pr}$. So, the nondimensional energy equation is:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial \\theta}{\\partial t^*} + (\\boldsymbol{u}^* \\cdot \\nabla^*) \\theta = \\frac{1}{\\mathrm{Re} \\cdot \\mathrm{Pr}} \\nabla^{*2} \\theta $$\n\nThe characteristic velocity $U$ is not externally imposed; it is established by the balance of forces in the system. The main dynamical balances in the momentum equation are:\n1.  **Buoyancy–Viscous Balance**: This occurs when inertia is negligible ($\\mathrm{Re} \\ll 1$). The viscous and buoyancy terms must balance. From the nondimensional equation, this implies $\\frac{1}{\\mathrm{Re}} \\sim \\frac{\\mathrm{Gr}}{\\mathrm{Re}^2}$, which gives the scaling $\\mathrm{Re} \\sim \\mathrm{Gr}$. This balance is physically realized in slow, creeping flows, which is self-consistent only if $\\mathrm{Gr}$ is small.\n2.  **Inertia–Buoyancy Balance**: This occurs when viscous forces are negligible (high $\\mathrm{Re}$). The inertial and buoyancy terms balance. This implies $1 \\sim \\frac{\\mathrm{Gr}}{\\mathrm{Re}^2}$, which gives the scaling $\\mathrm{Re} \\sim \\mathrm{Gr}^{1/2}$. This balance is characteristic of turbulent or high-speed natural convection, which is self-consistent when $\\mathrm{Gr} \\gg 1$.\n\nThe onset of convection itself (thermal instability) and the overall heat transfer are governed by the Rayleigh number, $\\mathrm{Ra} = \\frac{g \\beta \\Delta T L^3}{\\nu \\alpha}$. The Rayleigh number is the product of the Grashof and Prandtl numbers: $\\mathrm{Ra} = \\mathrm{Gr} \\cdot \\mathrm{Pr}$. It represents the ratio of the time scale for thermal diffusion ($\\tau_{diff} \\sim L^2/\\alpha$) to the time scale for thermal transport by convection ($\\tau_{conv} \\sim L/U$, with $U$ set by a buoyancy-viscous balance). It directly compares the driving buoyancy force to the dissipative effects of viscosity and thermal diffusivity. Convection begins when $\\mathrm{Ra}$ exceeds a critical value, $\\mathrm{Ra}_c$.\n\nNow we analyze the two fluid types.\n\n**Case 1: Air ($\\mathrm{Pr} \\approx 0.7$)**\nSince $\\mathrm{Pr} \\sim 1$, we have $\\mathrm{Ra} = \\mathrm{Gr} \\cdot \\mathrm{Pr} \\approx 0.7 \\mathrm{Gr}$. Thus, $\\mathrm{Ra}$ and $\\mathrm{Gr}$ are of the same order of magnitude. For thermal aspects, such as the onset criterion ($\\mathrm{Ra} > \\mathrm{Ra}_c$) and heat transfer correlations (e.g., Nusselt number $\\mathrm{Nu} = f(\\mathrm{Ra}, \\mathrm{Pr})$), $\\mathrm{Ra}$ is the controlling parameter. For the momentum transport regime, $\\mathrm{Gr}$ is the key parameter. For low $\\mathrm{Gr}$ (near onset), the flow is viscous-dominated, and one may consider the buoyancy-viscous balance which yields $\\mathrm{Re} \\sim \\mathrm{Gr}$. For high $\\mathrm{Gr}$, the flow becomes inertia-dominated, with $\\mathrm{Re} \\sim \\mathrm{Gr}^{1/2}$.\n\n**Case 2: Liquid Metals ($\\mathrm{Pr} \\ll 1$)**\nFor these fluids, $\\mathrm{Pr}$ is small, e.g., $10^{-2}$. The relation $\\mathrm{Ra} = \\mathrm{Gr} \\cdot \\mathrm{Pr}$ implies $\\mathrm{Gr} = \\mathrm{Ra} / \\mathrm{Pr}$. Because $\\mathrm{Pr} \\ll 1$, the Grashof number is much larger than the Rayleigh number: $\\mathrm{Gr} \\gg \\mathrm{Ra}$.\nThe onset of convection is still governed by $\\mathrm{Ra} > \\mathrm{Ra}_c$. However, even at a moderate $\\mathrm{Ra}$ near the critical value (e.g., $\\mathrm{Ra} \\sim 10^3$), the Grashof number can be very large. For $\\mathrm{Pr} = 10^{-2}$, $\\mathrm{Gr} = 10^3 / 10^{-2} = 10^5$.\nA very large $\\mathrm{Gr}$ indicates that inertia cannot be neglected in the momentum balance. An attempt to assume a buoyancy-viscous balance would give $\\mathrm{Re} \\sim \\mathrm{Gr} \\sim 10^5$, which contradicts the assumption of negligible inertia ($\\mathrm{Re} \\ll 1$). Therefore, for liquid metals, the momentum balance must involve inertia even for flows just past the onset of convection. The appropriate balance is either inertia-viscous-buoyancy or, in the limit of large $\\mathrm{Gr}$, a simpler inertia-buoyancy balance, which gives the scaling $\\mathrm{Re} \\sim \\mathrm{Gr}^{1/2}$. In our example, $\\mathrm{Re} \\sim (10^5)^{1/2} \\approx 316$. This is a non-negligible Reynolds number, confirming that the flow is inertial. Thus, for liquid metals, $\\mathrm{Ra}$ controls the thermal instability, while the large value of $\\mathrm{Gr}$ dictates an inertial flow regime with $\\mathrm{Re} \\sim \\mathrm{Gr}^{1/2} \\gtrsim \\mathcal{O}(1)$.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. In air with $\\mathrm{Pr}\\approx 0.7$, $\\mathrm{Ra}$ and $\\mathrm{Gr}$ are of the same order, so onset and heat-transfer scalings are governed by $\\mathrm{Ra}$, whereas velocity magnitude from a buoyancy–viscous balance yields $\\mathrm{Re}\\sim \\mathrm{Gr}$; in liquid metals with $\\mathrm{Pr}\\ll 1$, $\\mathrm{Ra}$ remains the control parameter for thermal transport and instability thresholds, but $\\mathrm{Gr}$ controls the momentum regime because even for moderate $\\mathrm{Ra}$ one can have $\\mathrm{Re}\\gtrsim \\mathcal{O}(1)$ (and often $\\gg 1$), leading to an inertia–buoyancy (or inertia–viscous–buoyancy) balance with $\\mathrm{Re}\\sim \\mathrm{Gr}^{1/2}$ when inertia balances buoyancy.**\n- This statement accurately describes the situation for both air and liquid metals. For air, it correctly identifies $\\mathrm{Ra}$ and $\\mathrm{Gr}$ as being of the same order, $\\mathrm{Ra}$ as governing thermal phenomena, and mentions the valid buoyancy-viscous scaling $\\mathrm{Re} \\sim \\mathrm{Gr}$. For liquid metals, it correctly states that $\\mathrm{Ra}$ governs thermal aspects while $\\mathrm{Gr}$ dictates an inertial momentum regime ($\\mathrm{Re}\\sim\\mathrm{Gr}^{1/2}$) due to the large disparity caused by $\\mathrm{Pr} \\ll 1$.\n- **Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. In air, $\\mathrm{Gr}$ is irrelevant and only $\\mathrm{Ra}$ matters for both heat transfer and momentum scaling; in liquid metals, $\\mathrm{Ra}$ is irrelevant and only $\\mathrm{Gr}$ matters for both heat and momentum.**\n- This is incorrect. For air, $\\mathrm{Gr}$ is central to momentum scaling. For liquid metals, $\\mathrm{Ra}$ is fundamental for the onset of convection and cannot be considered irrelevant.\n- **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. In air, $\\mathrm{Gr}$ controls both onset and heat transfer while $\\mathrm{Ra}$ is secondary; in liquid metals, $\\mathrm{Ra}$ controls onset but in both fluids inertia is negligible near onset so $\\mathrm{Re}\\ll 1$ whenever $\\mathrm{Ra}$ is near its critical value.**\n- First part is incorrect: $\\mathrm{Ra}$ is primary for onset and heat transfer, not $\\mathrm{Gr}$. Second part is critically flawed: for liquid metals, inertia is *not* negligible near onset because a moderate critical $\\mathrm{Ra}$ results in a large $\\mathrm{Gr}$, making the flow inertial.\n- **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. Since $\\mathrm{Ra}/\\mathrm{Gr}=\\mathrm{Pr}$, in liquid metals $\\mathrm{Ra}$ should be neglected because $\\mathrm{Pr}\\ll 1$, whereas in air with $\\mathrm{Pr}\\approx 1$ either $\\mathrm{Ra}$ or $\\mathrm{Gr}$ can be used interchangeably to characterize all balances.**\n- The conclusion that $\\mathrm{Ra}$ should be neglected for liquid metals is wrong; it is the crucial parameter for instability onset. The statement for air is an oversimplification; while numerically similar, $\\mathrm{Ra}$ and $\\mathrm{Gr}$ have distinct physical meanings for thermal and momentum transport, respectively.\n- **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**E. In liquid metals, the strong thermal diffusion implies $\\mathrm{Re}\\ll 1$ unless $\\mathrm{Ra}\\gg 1$, so momentum is always governed by a buoyancy–viscous balance with $\\mathrm{Re}\\sim \\mathrm{Gr}$; in air, the opposite holds and inertia is always dominant with $\\mathrm{Re}\\sim \\mathrm{Gr}^{1/2}$ regardless of $\\mathrm{Ra}$.**\n- This contains multiple errors. For liquid metals, strong thermal diffusion ($\\mathrm{Pr}\\ll 1$) leads to a large $\\mathrm{Gr}$ and thus a non-negligible $\\mathrm{Re}$, contradicting the claim that $\\mathrm{Re}\\ll 1$. The momentum balance is inertial, not viscous.

Your final answer must be a single closed-form expression.", "solution": "1. Explanation for the invalidity of the Oberbeck–Boussinesq (OB) approximation.\nThe OB approximation simplifies the governing equations for flows with small density variations, i.e., $\\Delta \\rho / \\rho_{0} \\ll 1$. It leads to two principal simplifications that fail when $\\Delta \\rho / \\rho_{0}=\\mathcal{O}(1)$.\n\nFirst, consider the continuity equation: $\\frac{\\partial \\rho}{\\partial t}+\\nabla \\cdot (\\rho \\mathbf{u})=0$. Substituting $\\rho = \\rho_0 + \\rho'$ gives $\\frac{\\partial \\rho'}{\\partial t} + \\nabla \\cdot ((\\rho_0 + \\rho') \\mathbf{u}) = 0$, which expands to $\\frac{\\partial \\rho'}{\\partial t} + \\mathbf{u} \\cdot \\nabla\\rho' + (\\rho_0+\\rho')\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{u} = 0$. Using characteristic scales $U$ and $L$, the terms have magnitudes $\\frac{\\Delta\\rho U}{L}$, $\\frac{\\Delta\\rho U}{L}$, and $(\\rho_0 - \\Delta\\rho)\\frac{U}{L}$ respectively (using $\\rho' \\sim -\\Delta \\rho$ for the plume core). If we divide by $\\rho_0 U/L$, the magnitudes become $\\frac{\\Delta\\rho}{\\rho_0}$, $\\frac{\\Delta\\rho}{\\rho_0}$, and $(1-\\frac{\\Delta\\rho}{\\rho_0})$. When $\\Delta\\rho / \\rho_{0}=\\mathcal{O}(1)$, all terms are of the same order of magnitude. The Boussinesq simplification to an incompressible flow, $\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{u} = 0$, is derived by arguing that terms involving $\\rho'$ are much smaller than the term $\\rho_0 \\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{u}$, which is only valid if $\\Delta\\rho/\\rho_0 \\ll 1$. Thus, for a high-temperature plume, the full variable-density continuity equation must be retained.\n\nSecond, consider the inertial term in the momentum equation, $\\nabla \\cdot (\\rho \\mathbf{u} \\mathbf{u})$. The OB approximation replaces $\\rho$ with the constant reference density $\\rho_0$, resulting in $\\rho_0 \\nabla \\cdot (\\mathbf{u} \\mathbf{u})$. The full term can be written as $\\nabla \\cdot ((\\rho_0+\\rho') \\mathbf{u} \\mathbf{u}) = \\nabla \\cdot (\\rho_0 \\mathbf{u} \\mathbf{u}) + \\nabla \\cdot (\\rho' \\mathbf{u} \\mathbf{u})$. The ratio of the magnitude of the second term to the first is $\\frac{|\\rho'|U^2/L}{\\rho_0 U^2/L} = \\frac{|\\rho'|}{\\rho_0} \\approx \\frac{\\Delta\\rho}{\\rho_0}$. If $\\Delta\\rho/\\rho_0 \\ll 1$, the second term is negligible, justifying the approximation. However, if $\\Delta\\rho/\\rho_0 = \\mathcal{O}(1)$, the term involving the density perturbation $\\rho'$ is of the same order as the term involving $\\rho_0$. Therefore, replacing $\\rho$ with $\\rho_0$ in the inertial term introduces an error of order unity, rendering the OB approximation invalid.\n\n2. Rescaling and identification of the inertia-buoyancy dimensionless group.\nWith the pressure decomposition $p=p_{h}(z)+p'(x,t)$ and the hydrostatic balance for the ambient fluid $dp_{h}/dz=-\\rho_{0} g$, the momentum equation becomes:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial (\\rho \\mathbf{u})}{\\partial t}+\\nabla \\cdot (\\rho \\mathbf{u}\\mathbf{u})=-\\nabla p' - \\rho' g \\mathbf{e}_z + \\mu \\nabla^{2}\\mathbf{u} $$\nwhere $\\rho' \\equiv \\rho - \\rho_0$ is the density perturbation. For the hot plume, $\\rho < \\rho_0$, so $\\rho' < 0$. The buoyancy force $- \\rho' g \\mathbf{e}_z$ is directed upwards. In the plume core, $\\rho' = \\rho_s - \\rho_0 = -(\\rho_0 - \\rho_s) = -\\Delta\\rho$.\n\nWe proceed to rescale the governing momentum balance for the steady-state plume core ($\\partial/\\partial t = 0$):\n$$ \\nabla \\cdot (\\rho \\mathbf{u} \\mathbf{u}) = -\\nabla p' - \\rho' g \\mathbf{e}_z + \\mu \\nabla^{2}\\mathbf{u} $$\nWe introduce the specified non-dimensional variables: $\\mathbf{x}^* = \\mathbf{x}/L$, $\\mathbf{u}^* = \\mathbf{u}/U$, $\\rho^* = \\rho/\\rho_0$, and $p'^* = p'/(\\rho_0 U^2)$. The differential operator becomes $\\nabla = \\frac{1}{L}\\nabla^*$. Substituting these into the equation:\n$$ \\frac{1}{L} \\nabla^* \\cdot ((\\rho_0 \\rho^*) (U \\mathbf{u}^*) (U \\mathbf{u}^*)) = -\\frac{1}{L} (\\rho_0 U^2) \\nabla^* p'^* - (\\rho_0(\\rho^*-1)) g \\mathbf{e}_z + \\mu \\frac{U}{L^2} \\nabla^{*2} \\mathbf{u}^* $$\nDividing every term by the characteristic scale of the inertial force density, $\\rho_0 U^2 / L$, yields the non-dimensional equation:\n$$ \\nabla^* \\cdot (\\rho^* \\mathbf{u}^* \\mathbf{u}^*) = -\\nabla^* p'^* - \\frac{gL}{U^2}(\\rho^*-1)\\mathbf{e}_z + \\frac{\\mu}{\\rho_0 U L} \\nabla^{*2} \\mathbf{u}^* $$\nThe non-dimensional buoyancy term is $-\\frac{gL}{U^2}(\\rho^*-1)\\mathbf{e}_z$. Within the plume core, the density perturbation is $\\rho' \\approx -\\Delta\\rho$, so $\\rho^*-1 = \\rho'/\\rho_0 \\approx -\\Delta\\rho/\\rho_0$. The magnitude of the buoyancy term is therefore of order $\\frac{gL}{U^2} \\frac{\\Delta\\rho}{\\rho_0}$. Using the definition of the reduced gravity, $g' \\equiv \\frac{\\Delta\\rho}{\\rho_0}g$, this magnitude is $\\frac{g'L}{U^2}$.\nThe term representing inertia is $\\nabla^* \\cdot (\\rho^* \\mathbf{u}^* \\mathbf{u}^*)$, which is of order $\\mathcal{O}(\\rho^*) = \\mathcal{O}(\\rho_s/\\rho_0)$, an order-one quantity. Therefore, the dimensionless group that appears as the coefficient of the buoyancy force and compares it to the reference inertial force is $\\frac{g'L}{U^2}$. This group is a form of Richardson number, or the inverse of the square of the densimetric Froude number, $Fr \\equiv U/\\sqrt{g'L}$.\n\n3. Determination of the velocity scale $U$.\nFor a high-Reynolds-number plume, the viscous forces are subdominant to inertia and buoyancy. The primary dynamic balance is between the inertial and buoyancy terms in the vertical momentum equation. To determine the intrinsic velocity scale $U$, we equate the orders of magnitude of these dominant physical forces in their dimensional form.\nThe inertial force density is given by the term $\\nabla \\cdot (\\rho \\mathbf{u} \\mathbf{u})$. In the plume core, where the density is $\\rho_s$ and the velocity is $U$, its scale is:\n$$ ||\\nabla \\cdot (\\rho \\mathbf{u} \\mathbf{u})|| \\sim \\frac{\\rho_s U^2}{L} $$\nThe buoyancy force density is given by the term $-\\rho'g$. In the plume core, its magnitude is:\n$$ ||-\\rho'g|| \\sim |-\\Delta\\rho| g = \\Delta\\rho g $$\nImposing an \"order-one balance\" means that these two scales must be comparable:\n$$ \\frac{\\rho_s U^2}{L} \\sim \\Delta\\rho g $$\nSolving for the velocity scale $U$:\n$$ U^2 \\sim \\frac{\\Delta\\rho g L}{\\rho_s} $$\nTo express this in terms of the reduced gravity $g'$, we substitute $\\Delta\\rho = \\rho_0 (g'/g)$:\n$$ U^2 \\sim \\frac{(\\rho_0 g'/g) g L}{\\rho_s} = \\frac{\\rho_0}{\\rho_s} g' L $$\nThe problem stipulates that $\\Delta\\rho/\\rho_0=\\mathcal{O}(1)$. This implies that the density ratio $\\rho_s/\\rho_0 = 1 - \\Delta\\rho/\\rho_0$ is also a number of order unity (provided the plume is not a vacuum). Consequently, its inverse $\\rho_0/\\rho_s$ is also an $\\mathcal{O}(1)$ factor. In scaling analysis, such order-one numerical factors are absorbed into the proportionality constant. Thus, the fundamental scaling relationship is:\n$$ U^2 \\sim g'L $$\nThe problem asks for a closed-form symbolic expression for $U$ in terms of $g'$ and $L$. The simplest expression that captures this scaling is obtained by setting the proportionality constant to $1$:\n$$ U = \\sqrt{g'L} $$\nThis result \"collapses the balance to order unity\" in the sense of scaling, as it defines the characteristic velocity for which the Richardson number $\\frac{g'L}{U^2}$ is of order one.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\sqrt{g' L}}$$", "id": "2520489"}]}
