This practice explores the basic Euclidean geometry that governs the packing of tubes in both in-line and staggered arrangements. You will develop the ability to translate physical requirements, such as avoiding tube interference, into precise mathematical criteria involving the transverse pitch ($S_T$), longitudinal pitch ($S_L$), and tube diameter ($D$), which is the foundational first step in any heat exchanger design [@problem_id:2476422].", "problem": "A two-dimensional crossflow heat exchanger employs a bank of circular tubes of diameter $D$ arranged on a periodic lattice. The transverse pitch $S_T$ is the center-to-center spacing between tubes within the same row, measured normal to the flow direction. The longitudinal pitch $S_L$ is the center-to-center spacing between adjacent rows, measured in the flow direction. Two canonical layouts are considered: an in-line arrangement (rows aligned so that tubes in adjacent rows are not laterally offset) and a staggered arrangement (rows offset laterally by one half of the transverse pitch, so that a tube in one row lies midway between two tubes in the next row). Assume an infinite bank so that boundary effects are negligible and the problem reduces to lattice geometry.\n\nStarting from the non-overlap condition for two equal circles in the plane and using only Euclidean distance and the definitions of $S_T$, $S_L$, and $D$, derive a necessary and sufficient geometric criterion for the feasibility of packing (no tube interference) for both in-line and staggered arrangements in terms of $S_T$, $S_L$, and $D$.

The terminology is standard and the objectives are quantifiable. A potential ambiguity exists in the phrase \"evaluate $\\gamma$ for the candidate design,\" as the parameters $S_T/D$ and $S_L/D$ alone do not specify whether the arrangement is in-line or staggered. However, a preliminary analysis shows that for the given numerical values, the minimum clearance is identical for both configurations. This resolves the ambiguity, rendering the problem well-posed and internally consistent.\n\n**Verdict:** The problem is deemed valid. A solution will be formulated.\n\n**Derivation of Geometric Criterion and Solution**\n\nThe fundamental condition for no tube interference is that the distance between the centers of any two tubes, $\\vec{r}_i$ and $\\vec{r}_j$, must satisfy the inequality:\n$$|\\vec{r}_i - \\vec{r}_j| \\ge D$$\nThis must hold for all pairs of tubes in the bank. Due to the periodic nature of the lattice, it is sufficient to consider the distances from a single reference tube to all its neighbors and find the minimum among them, $d_{min}$. The feasibility criterion is then simply $d_{min} \\ge D$.\n\nWe establish a coordinate system where the flow is along the $x$-axis and the transverse direction is along the $y$-axis. A reference tube is placed at the origin $(0, 0)$.\n\n**Case 1: In-Line Arrangement**\nIn an in-line arrangement, the tube centers are located at positions $(x, y) = (mS_L, nS_T)$, where $m$ and $n$ are integers. For the reference tube at $(0,0)$, the nearest neighbors are:\n1.  In the same row ($m=0$): at $(0, \\pm S_T)$. The distance is $S_T$.\n2.  In the same column ($n=0$): at $(\\pm S_L, 0)$. The distance is $S_L$.\n\nOther neighbors, such as the diagonal ones at $(\\pm S_L, \\pm S_T)$, are at a larger distance of $\\sqrt{S_L^2 + S_T^2}$. Therefore, the minimum center-to-center distance is:\n$$d_{min, inline} = \\min(S_T, S_L)$$\nThe necessary and sufficient geometric criterion for feasibility is that this minimum distance must be at least $D$. This is equivalent to the two simultaneous conditions:\n$$S_T \\ge D \\quad \\text{and} \\quad S_L \\ge D$$\n\n**Case 2: Staggered Arrangement**\nIn a staggered arrangement, we place the reference tube at the origin $(0,0)$. Its neighbors in the same row are at $(0, \\pm S_T)$. The distance is $S_T$. The adjacent rows are at $x = \\pm S_L$. The tubes in these rows are shifted transversely by $S_T/2$. The centers of the nearest tubes in the adjacent rows are at $(\\pm S_L, \\pm S_T/2)$. The distance from the origin to these tubes is the diagonal pitch, $S_D$:\n$$S_D = \\sqrt{(\\pm S_L - 0)^2 + (\\pm S_T/2 - 0)^2} = \\sqrt{S_L^2 + \\left(\\frac{S_T}{2}\\right)^2}$$\nThe minimum center-to-center distance for a staggered arrangement is the minimum of the transverse pitch and the diagonal pitch:\n$$d_{min, staggered} = \\min\\left(S_T, \\sqrt{S_L^2 + \\left(\\frac{S_T}{2}\\right)^2}\\right)$$\nThe necessary and sufficient geometric criterion for feasibility is:\n$$\\min\\left(S_T, \\sqrt{S_L^2 + \\left(\\frac{S_T}{2}\\right)^2}\\right) \\ge D$$\nThis is equivalent to the two simultaneous conditions: $S_T \\ge D$ and $\\sqrt{S_L^2 + (S_T/2)^2} \\ge D$.\n\n**Evaluation of Minimum Non-dimensional Clearance $\\gamma$**\nThe minimum non-dimensional clearance is defined as $\\gamma = (d_{min}/D) - 1$.\n\nFor the given design parameters, $S_T/D = 1.5$ and $S_L/D = 2.0$. We evaluate $\\gamma$ for both possible layouts.\n\n**In-Line Arrangement Evaluation:**\nThe minimum non-dimensional distance is $\\min(S_T/D, S_L/D)$.\n$$\\frac{d_{min, inline}}{D} = \\min(1.5, 2.0) = 1.5$$\nThe clearance is:\n$$\\gamma_{inline} = \\frac{d_{min, inline}}{D} - 1 = 1.5 - 1 = 0.5$$\nSince $\\gamma_{inline} = 0.5 \\ge 0$, this arrangement is feasible.\n\n**Staggered Arrangement Evaluation:**\nThe minimum non-dimensional distance is $\\min(S_T/D, S_D/D)$, where $S_D/D = \\sqrt{(S_L/D)^2 + (S_T/(2D))^2}$.\nFirst, we compute the non-dimensional diagonal pitch:\n$$\\frac{S_D}{D} = \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{S_L}{D}\\right)^2 + \\left(\\frac{S_T}{2D}\\right)^2} = \\sqrt{(2.0)^2 + \\left(\\frac{1.5}{2}\\right)^2} = \\sqrt{4.0 + (0.75)^2} = \\sqrt{4.0 + 0.5625} = \\sqrt{4.5625}$$\nNumerically, $\\sqrt{4.5625} \\approx 2.1360$.\nNow we find the minimum non-dimensional distance:\n$$\\frac{d_{min, staggered}}{D} = \\min\\left(\\frac{S_T}{D}, \\frac{S_D}{D}\\right) = \\min(1.5, \\sqrt{4.5625}) = 1.5$$\nThe clearance is:\n$$\\gamma_{staggered} = \\frac{d_{min, staggered}}{D} - 1 = 1.5 - 1 = 0.5$$\nSince $\\gamma_{staggered} = 0.5 \\ge 0$, this arrangement is also feasible.\n\nBoth possible layouts for the given pitch ratios yield the exact same minimum non-dimensional clearance $\\gamma = 0.5$. The initial ambiguity in the problem statement is thus resolved, and the unique value for $\\gamma$ associated with these pitch parameters is $0.5$. The packing is feasible. Expressed to $4$ significant figures, the value is $0.5000$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.5000}$$", "id": "2476422"}, {"introduction": "Once a feasible geometric layout is established, the next logical step is to understand how this arrangement affects the fluid flow. The constriction between tubes forces the fluid to accelerate, creating regions of high velocity that are critical for determining the nature of the flow and the subsequent heat transfer. This exercise applies the fundamental principle of mass conservation to an in-line tube bank to directly link the geometric pitch to the maximum fluid velocity ($V_{\\max}$) in the narrowest gaps [@problem_id:2476457]. By deriving this relationship, you will gain a clear physical intuition for why $V_{\\max}$, rather than the approach velocity $V_{\\infty}$, is the characteristic velocity used for calculating the Reynolds number and Nusselt number in most tube bank correlations.", "problem": "An unbounded crossflow of an incompressible fluid with uniform approach speed $V_{\\infty}$ impinges on an infinitely wide, infinitely deep, in-line tube bank of circular cylinders of diameter $D$. The bank has transverse pitch $S_{T}$ and longitudinal pitch $S_{L}$, with both $S_{T} > D$ and $S_{L} > D$. Consider a notional control strip of unit depth (into the page) spanning one transverse pitch $S_{T}$. Assume steady, two-dimensional, high-Reynolds-number flow such that viscous boundary layers remain thin compared to $D$ and that the dominant acceleration occurs through the geometric constrictions between adjacent cylinders, with negligible compressibility effects.\n\nUsing only conservation of mass and geometric considerations applied to one transverse pitch of the in-line array, derive an expression for the ratio $V_{\\max}/V_{\\infty}$, where $V_{\\max}$ is the peak local speed in the narrowest open flow passage between two adjacent cylinders within a row. Then, for fixed $S_{L}/D$, determine the value of the ratio $S_{T}/D$ for which $V_{\\max}$ is exactly twice $V_{\\infty}$ in an in-line arrangement. Finally, explain the physical meaning of this value of $S_{T}/D$ in terms of open flow area and blockage. Express your final answer as the exact dimensionless ratio $S_{T}/D$; no units are required and no rounding is necessary.", "solution": "We begin from conservation of mass (continuity) for an incompressible flow. For a control strip of unit depth (into the page) spanning one transverse pitch $S_{T}$, the volumetric flow rate per pitch is conserved between a plane far upstream and a plane passing through the minimum open area between adjacent cylinders in a given row.\n\nLet the upstream cross-section be a line segment of width $S_{T}$ (per unit depth) across which the local streamwise velocity is uniform and equal to $V_{\\infty}$ by construction. The volumetric flow rate per pitch upstream is therefore\n$$\n\\dot{Q}_{\\infty} = V_{\\infty} S_{T}\n$$\nWithin an in-line array, the narrowest open flow passage in each row is the gap between two adjacent cylinders whose projected blockage subtracts a width $D$ from the pitch. Neglecting the detailed boundary-layer displacement thickness at high Reynolds number and adopting the standard constriction approximation used in tube-bank analyses, the dominant acceleration occurs as the flow is funneled through the gap of open width $S_{T}-D$ over the same unit depth. In that minimum-area section, the local velocity profile across the open gap is nearly uniform at its peak value $V_{\\max}$ due to the jet-like acceleration through the constriction.

The upstream frontal area per pitch and unit depth is $S_{T}\\times 1 = 2D\\times 1$. Hence the minimum open area is exactly one-half of the upstream frontal area, implying by continuity that the speed in the constricted passage must double relative to the approach speed. This is the canonical case where the local porosity at the minimum section equals $1/2$, yielding a factor-of-two acceleration, and it clarifies why the result is insensitive to $S_{L}$ for an in-line array: the controlling constriction is purely transverse. Additionally, feasibility requires $S_{T}>D$; as $S_T \\to D$, the open gap vanishes and $V_{\\max}/V_{\\infty} \\to \\infty$ under the idealized inviscid-constriction model, indicating unphysical blockage in the limit.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{2}$$", "id": "2476457"}, {"introduction": "The ultimate goal of analyzing a tube bank is often to predict its overall thermal performance—how effectively it transfers heat between the fluid and the tubes. This requires integrating our understanding of geometry and fluid flow to model the temperature change of the fluid as it passes through the bank. This culminating practice guides you through developing a row-by-row model of a heat exchanger using a discrete energy balance [@problem_id:2476418].

The tubes are internally well-mixed so that each row presents an isothermal surface at temperature $T_{s}$. The gas enters the bank with bulk temperature $T_{b,0}$ and mass flow rate $\\dot{m}$, and has constant specific heat $c_{p}$. Consider a lumped description at the scale of a row: immediately upstream of each row $i$, the gas has a uniform bulk temperature $T_{b,i}$, and the row removes heat from the gas according to Newton’s law of cooling with a row-averaged external convection coefficient $h_{o}$ and known external area per row $A_{\\text{row}}$.

It presents a standard problem in convective heat transfer that is solvable using fundamental principles. All necessary data are provided, and the assumptions, while simplifying, are physically reasonable for a pedagogical context. The problem is valid.\n\nThe solution proceeds by applying the fundamental principles stated in the problem to a single representative row of the tube bank, deriving a discrete model for the temperature evolution, and then solving this model.\n\nLet us consider a control volume for the gas stream as it passes across row $i$, where $i$ is an index from $0$ to $N_r-1$. The gas enters row $i$ with a bulk temperature $T_{b,i}$ and exits with a bulk temperature $T_{b,i+1}$. The tube surface is maintained at a constant temperature $T_s$.\n\nThe first principle is the steady-state control-volume energy balance for the gas. As the gas is cooled by the tubes, the rate of heat transferred from the gas to the tubes, $\\dot{q}_i$, is given by:\n$$\n\\dot{q}_i = \\dot{m} c_{p} (T_{b,i} - T_{b,i+1})\n$$\nwhere $\\dot{m}$ is the mass flow rate and $c_p$ is the specific heat at constant pressure.\n\nThe second principle is Newton's law of cooling, which describes the heat transfer from the fluid to the tube surface of row $i$. The problem specifies a \"lumped description at the scale of a row\". The most direct interpretation for such a discrete model is to evaluate the heat transfer rate using the temperature at the inlet of the control volume (the row). Thus, the driving temperature difference is based on the bulk temperature upstream of row $i$, which is $T_{b,i}$. The heat transfer rate is then:\n$$\n\\dot{q}_i = h_{o} A_{\\text{row}} (T_{b,i} - T_{s})\n$$\nwhere $h_o$ is the row-averaged external convection coefficient and $A_{\\text{row}}$ is the external surface area of the tubes in one row.\n\nBy equating the two expressions for $\\dot{q}_i$, we establish the relationship between the inlet and outlet temperatures for row $i$:\n$$\n\\dot{m} c_{p} (T_{b,i} - T_{b,i+1}) = h_{o} A_{\\text{row}} (T_{b,i} - T_{s})\n$$\nThe problem requires an analysis in terms of the approach temperature, defined as $\\theta_i \\equiv T_{b,i} - T_s$.

The equation is now:\n$$\n\\dot{m} c_{p} (\\theta_i - \\theta_{i+1}) = h_{o} A_{\\text{row}} \\theta_i\n$$\nThis is a first-order linear recurrence relation for the approach temperature. We must solve for $\\theta_{i+1}$ in terms of $\\theta_i$:\n$$\n\\theta_i - \\theta_{i+1} = \\frac{h_{o} A_{\\text{row}}}{\\dot{m} c_{p}} \\theta_i\n$$\n$$\n\\theta_{i+1} = \\theta_i - \\left( \\frac{h_{o} A_{\\text{row}}}{\\dot{m} c_{p}} \\right) \\theta_i = \\left( 1 - \\frac{h_{o} A_{\\text{row}}}{\\dot{m} c_{p}} \\right) \\theta_i\n$$\nThis relation describes the evolution of the approach temperature from one row to the next. It is a geometric progression. Let the constant factor be $\\beta = 1 - \\frac{h_{o} A_{\\text{row}}}{\\dot{m} c_{p}}$. The relation is $\\theta_{i+1} = \\beta \\theta_i$.\n\nWe can apply this relation recursively starting from the inlet of the tube bank, where the approach temperature is $\\theta_0 = T_{b,0} - T_s$.\nFor the first row ($i=0$): $\\theta_1 = \\beta \\theta_0$.\nFor the second row ($i=1$): $\\theta_2 = \\beta \\theta_1 = \\beta (\\beta \\theta_0) = \\beta^2 \\theta_0$.\nBy induction, after $N_r$ rows, the approach temperature at the outlet of the bank (which is the inlet to hypothetical row $N_r$) is given by:\n$$\n\\theta_{N_r} = \\beta^{N_r} \\theta_0\n$$\nSubstituting the expression for $\\beta$, we obtain the required closed-form expression for the approach temperature evolution:\n$$\n\\theta_{N_r} = \\left( 1 - \\frac{h_{o} A_{\\text{row}}}{\\dot{m} c_{p}} \\right)^{N_r} \\theta_0\n$$\nThis completes the derivation.
