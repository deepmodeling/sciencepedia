A solution will be furnished.\n\nThe analysis proceeds by deriving the required expressions before numerical substitution.\n\nFirst, an order-of-magnitude expression for the convective heat transfer coefficient, $h$, is derived. The problem provides the scaling law for the Nusselt number, $Nu_{L}$, as a function of the Rayleigh number, $Ra_{L}$:\n$$Nu_{L} \\sim Ra_{L}^{1/4}$$\nFor an order-of-magnitude analysis, we treat this proportionality as an approximate equality, $Nu_{L} \\approx Ra_{L}^{1/4}$. The Nusselt and Rayleigh numbers are defined as:\n$$Nu_{L} \\equiv \\frac{hL}{k}$$\n$$Ra_{L} \\equiv \\frac{g\\beta\\Delta T L^3}{\\nu\\alpha}$$\nwhere $h$ is the convective heat transfer coefficient, $L$ is the characteristic length (the plate height), $k$ is the thermal conductivity of the fluid, $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity, $\\beta$ is the coefficient of thermal expansion, $\\Delta T$ is the temperature difference, $\\nu$ is the kinematic viscosity, and $\\alpha$ is the thermal diffusivity.\n\nSubstituting these definitions into the scaling relation gives:\n$$\\frac{hL}{k} \\approx \\left( \\frac{g\\beta\\Delta T L^3}{\\nu\\alpha} \\right)^{1/4}$$\nSolving for $h$, we obtain the desired expression:\n$$h \\approx \\frac{k}{L} \\left( \\frac{g\\beta\\Delta T L^3}{\\nu\\alpha} \\right)^{1/4} = k \\left( \\frac{g\\beta\\Delta T}{\\nu\\alpha L} \\right)^{1/4}$$\n\nNext, we define the conduction-only baseline heat transfer coefficient, $h_{\\mathrm{cond}}$. This coefficient corresponds to heat transfer by pure conduction through a stagnant fluid layer of thickness $L$. According to Fourier's law of conduction, the heat flux $q''$ across this layer is:\n$$q'' = k \\frac{\\Delta T}{L}$$\nBy definition, the heat transfer coefficient relates heat flux to the temperature difference via Newton's law of cooling, $q'' = h \\Delta T$. For the pure conduction case, this becomes:\n$$q'' = h_{\\mathrm{cond}} \\Delta T$$\nEquating the two expressions for $q''$ yields the definition of $h_{\\mathrm{cond}}$:\n$$h_{\\mathrm{cond}} = \\frac{k}{L}$$\n\nThe enhancement factor $E$ is defined as the ratio $h/h_{\\mathrm{cond}}$:\n$$E = \\frac{h}{h_{\\mathrm{cond}}} = \\frac{ \\frac{k}{L} Nu_L }{ \\frac{k}{L} } = Nu_L$$\nThis result is fundamental: the Nusselt number is precisely the ratio of convective heat transfer to the heat transfer that would occur by pure conduction over the same characteristic length.
