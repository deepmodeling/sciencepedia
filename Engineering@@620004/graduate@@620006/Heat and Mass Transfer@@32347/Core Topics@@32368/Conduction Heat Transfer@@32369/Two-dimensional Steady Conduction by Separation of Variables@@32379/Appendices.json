It is well-posed, providing a linear elliptic PDE on a simple domain with a complete set of boundary conditions (one condition specified on each of the four boundary segments). The statement is objective and uses precise mathematical language. The conditions are not contradictory. The problem is physically interpretable as a rectangular plate with two opposite sides held at a constant reference temperature of zero, and the other two opposite sides being perfectly insulated. The problem is therefore deemed valid. We proceed to the solution.\n\nStep 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. The solution will now be derived from first principles.\n\nThe governing equation for two-dimensional, steady-state heat conduction in a homogeneous medium with constant thermal conductivity and no heat generation is the Laplace equation:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial^2 T}{\\partial x^2} + \\frac{\\partial^2 T}{\\partial y^2} = 0 $$\nWe employ the method of separation of variables, assuming a solution of the form $T(x,y) = X(x)Y(y)$. Substituting this into the Laplace equation yields:\n$$ X''(x)Y(y) + X(x)Y''(y) = 0 $$\nwhere primes denote ordinary differentiation with respect to the function's argument. To separate the variables, we divide by the product $X(x)Y(y)$, assuming it is non-zero:\n$$ \\frac{X''(x)}{X(x)} = -\\frac{Y''(y)}{Y(y)} $$\nThe left side is a function of $x$ alone, while the right side is a function of $y$ alone. For this equality to hold for all $x$ and $y$ in the domain, both sides must be equal to a constant, which we shall denote as $-\\lambda^2$. The choice of a negative constant is informed by the presence of homogeneous boundary conditions at two distinct points in the $x$-direction, which typically necessitates an oscillatory (sinusoidal) solution.\n\nThis separation leads to two ordinary differential equations (ODEs):\n1. For $X(x)$: $X''(x) + \\lambda^2 X(x) = 0$\n2. For $Y(y)$: $Y''(y) - \\lambda^2 Y(y) = 0$\n\nWe first solve the problem for $X(x)$ using the homogeneous Dirichlet boundary conditions at $x=0$ and $x=a$:\n$T(0,y) = X(0)Y(y) = 0 \\implies X(0)=0$ (for non-trivial $Y(y)$).\n$T(a,y) = X(a)Y(y) = 0 \\implies X(a)=0$ (for non-trivial $Y(y)$).\n\nThe general solution to the ODE for $X(x)$ is:\n$X(x) = C_1 \\cos(\\lambda x) + C_2 \\sin(\\lambda x)$.\nApplying the first condition, $X(0)=0$:\n$C_1 \\cos(0) + C_2 \\sin(0) = C_1 = 0$.\nThe solution form reduces to $X(x) = C_2 \\sin(\\lambda x)$.\nApplying the second condition, $X(a)=0$:\n$C_2 \\sin(\\lambda a) = 0$.\nFor a non-trivial solution, we must have $C_2 \\ne 0$, which requires $\\sin(\\lambda a) = 0$. This condition is satisfied if $\\lambda a = n\\pi$, where $n$ is an integer.\nThe eigenvalues are thus $\\lambda_n = \\frac{n\\pi}{a}$ for $n=1, 2, 3, \\dots$. The case $n=0$ yields $\\lambda=0$, which implies $X(x)=0$, a trivial solution we will examine separately. Negative integers for $n$ do not produce new linearly independent solutions.\nThe corresponding eigenfunctions are $X_n(x) = \\sin\\left(\\frac{n\\pi x}{a}\\right)$.\n\nNow, we solve the ODE for $Y(y)$ for each eigenvalue $\\lambda_n$:\n$Y_n''(y) - \\lambda_n^2 Y_n(y) = 0$.\nThe general solution to this equation is:\n$Y_n(y) = D_n \\cosh(\\lambda_n y) + E_n \\sinh(\\lambda_n y)$.\nThe derivative is $Y_n'(y) = \\lambda_n D_n \\sinh(\\lambda_n y) + \\lambda_n E_n \\cosh(\\lambda_n y)$.\n\nWe apply the homogeneous Neumann boundary conditions in the $y$-direction:\n$\\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial y}(x,0) = X(x)Y'(0) = 0 \\implies Y'(0)=0$.\n$\\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial y}(x,b) = X(x)Y'(b) = 0 \\implies Y'(b)=0$.\n\nApplying the first condition, $Y_n'(0)=0$, for a specific mode $n$:\n$Y_n'(0) = \\lambda_n D_n \\sinh(0) + \\lambda_n E_n \\cosh(0) = \\lambda_n E_n = 0$.\nSince $\\lambda_n = \\frac{n\\pi}{a} \\ne 0$ for $n \\ge 1$, we must have $E_n = 0$.\nThe solution for $Y_n(y)$ simplifies to $Y_n(y) = D_n \\cosh(\\lambda_n y)$.\n\nNow, we apply the second condition, $Y_n'(b)=0$:\nThe derivative is $Y_n'(y) = \\lambda_n D_n \\sinh(\\lambda_n y)$.\n$Y_n'(b) = \\lambda_n D_n \\sinh(\\lambda_n b) = 0$.\nThis equation involves three factors: $\\lambda_n$, $D_n$, and $\\sinh(\\lambda_n b)$.\n- We have established that $\\lambda_n = \\frac{n\\pi}{a} \\ne 0$ for $n \\ge 1$.\n- The argument of the hyperbolic sine function is $\\lambda_n b = \\frac{n\\pi b}{a}$. Since $n \\ge 1$ and the dimensions $a$ and $b$ are positive, the argument is strictly positive. The function $\\sinh(z)$ is zero only when $z=0$. Therefore, $\\sinh(\\lambda_n b) \\ne 0$.\n- For the product $\\lambda_n D_n \\sinh(\\lambda_n b)$ to be zero, the only remaining possibility is that the coefficient $D_n$ must be zero for all $n=1, 2, 3, \\dots$.\n\nThis means that for every mode $n \\ge 1$, the only solution is the trivial one, where $D_n=0$ and $E_n=0$.\n\nFinally, we must check the case for the separation constant being zero, which corresponds to $n=0$ (i.e., $\\lambda=0$). The ODEs become:\n$X''(x) = 0 \\implies X(x) = C_1 x + C_2$.\n$Y''(y) = 0 \\implies Y(y) = C_3 y + C_4$.\nApplying the boundary conditions for $X(x)$:\n$X(0) = C_2 = 0$.\n$X(a) = C_1 a + C_2 = C_1 a = 0$. Since $a \\ne 0$, this implies $C_1=0$.\nThus, $X(x) = 0$ is the only solution for the case $\\lambda=0$. Consequently, the product solution $T(x,y) = X(x)Y(y)$ is also zero.\n\nThe full solution is constructed by the principle of superposition:\n$$ T(x,y) = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} T_n(x,y) = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} X_n(x) Y_n(y) $$\nOur analysis has shown that the coefficient for each mode must be zero. That is, $D_n=0$ and $E_n=0$ for all $n \\ge 1$. The $n=0$ mode also contributes nothing.\nTherefore, the only solution that satisfies the governing equation and all four homogeneous boundary conditions is the trivial solution. This conclusion is also supported by the maximum principle for harmonic functions, which dictates that the maximum and minimum values of the temperature must occur on the boundary. Since the temperature is zero on two boundaries and the temperature gradient is zero on the other two (preventing extrema unless the function is constant, by Hopf's lemma), the temperature must be zero everywhere to satisfy these constraints simultaneously.\n\nThe resulting mode expansion is a series where all coefficients are zero. The final expression is simply:\n$T(x,y) = 0$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{0}\n$$", "id": "2536489"}, {"introduction": "Building on the fundamentals, this practice introduces a powerful problem-solving strategy: the use of symmetry to simplify analysis.

We verify this by observing that the domain is symmetric, and the boundary conditions are also symmetric. The temperature profile at $y=b$ is explicitly symmetric, $T(a-z, b) = T(a+z, b)$ for $z \\in [0,a]$. The condition $T(x,0)=0$ is also symmetric. The insulation conditions at $x=0$ and $x=2a$ are consistent with a symmetric temperature field.

The boundary conditions are checked for consistency at the corners: $T(0,0)$ is $0$ from both BC $1$ and BC $3$; $T(L,0)$ is $0$ from both BC $2$ and BC $3$. The setup is a canonical example of two-dimensional conduction solvable by separation of variables. It is free of ambiguity, contradiction, or pseudoscience.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is deemed valid. A full solution will be provided.\n\n**Task 1: Justification of the Governing PDE and Solution Verification**\n\nFirst, the derivation of the governing equation. The conservation of energy for a differential control volume under steady-state conditions ($\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t} = 0$) with no internal heat generation ($\\dot{q} = 0$) is expressed as the divergence of the heat flux vector being zero:\n$$ \\nabla \\cdot \\vec{q} = 0 $$\nFourier's law of heat conduction relates the heat flux vector $\\vec{q}$ to the temperature gradient $\\nabla T$:\n$$ \\vec{q} = -k \\nabla T $$\nwhere $k$ is the thermal conductivity. Substituting Fourier's law into the energy balance gives:\n$$ \\nabla \\cdot (-k \\nabla T) = 0 $$\nFor a homogeneous and isotropic material, $k$ is a constant scalar, which can be factored out:\n$$ -k \\nabla \\cdot (\\nabla T) = -k \\nabla^2 T = 0 $$\nSince $k$ is non-zero, this simplifies to the Laplace equation:\n$$ \\nabla^2 T = 0 $$\nIn a two-dimensional Cartesian coordinate system, this equation is:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial^2 T}{\\partial x^2} + \\frac{\\partial^2 T}{\\partial y^2} = 0 $$\nThis justifies the governing PDE.\n\nNext, we verify that the proposed solution $T(x,y)$ satisfies this equation. The solution is a linear superposition of two terms:\n$T(x,y) = T_1(x,y) + T_2(x,y)$, where\n$$ T_1(x,y) = C_1 \\sin(\\lambda_1 x) \\cosh(\\lambda_1(H-y)) \\quad \\text{with } \\lambda_1 = \\frac{\\pi}{L}, C_1 = \\frac{T_0}{\\cosh(\\lambda_1 H)} $$\n$$ T_2(x,y) = C_2 \\sin(\\lambda_2 x) \\cosh(\\lambda_2(H-y)) \\quad \\text{with } \\lambda_2 = \\frac{3\\pi}{L}, C_2 = \\frac{T_0}{2\\cosh(\\lambda_2 H)} $$\nDue to the linearity of the Laplace operator $\\nabla^2$, we can verify each term separately. For $T_1(x,y)$:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial T_1}{\\partial x} = C_1 \\lambda_1 \\cos(\\lambda_1 x) \\cosh(\\lambda_1(H-y)) $$\n$$ \\frac{\\partial^2 T_1}{\\partial x^2} = -C_1 \\lambda_1^2 \\sin(\\lambda_1 x) \\cosh(\\lambda_1(H-y)) = -\\lambda_1^2 T_1 $$\n$$ \\frac{\\partial T_1}{\\partial y} = -C_1 \\lambda_1 \\sin(\\lambda_1 x) \\sinh(\\lambda_1(H-y)) $$\n$$ \\frac{\\partial^2 T_1}{\\partial y^2} = C_1 \\lambda_1^2 \\sin(\\lambda_1 x) \\cosh(\\lambda_1(H-y)) = \\lambda_1^2 T_1 $$\nAdding the second partial derivatives:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial^2 T_1}{\\partial x^2} + \\frac{\\partial^2 T_1}{\\partial y^2} = -\\lambda_1^2 T_1 + \\lambda_1^2 T_1 = 0 $$\nThe same procedure for $T_2(x,y)$ yields $\\frac{\\partial^2 T_2}{\\partial x^2} = -\\lambda_2^2 T_2$ and $\\frac{\\partial^2 T_2}{\\partial y^2} = \\lambda_2^2 T_2$, so $\\nabla^2 T_2 = 0$.\nSince $\\nabla^2 T_1 = 0$ and $\\nabla^2 T_2 = 0$, then $\\nabla^2 T = \\nabla^2(T_1 + T_2) = \\nabla^2 T_1 + \\nabla^2 T_2 = 0$. The proposed solution satisfies the Laplace equation.\n\n**Task 2: Verification of Boundary Conditions and Corner Continuity**\n\nWe check each of the four boundary conditions:\n1.  At $x=0$: $T(0,y) = T_0\\left[\\sin(0)\\frac{\\cosh(\\dots)}{\\cosh(\\dots)} + \\frac{1}{2}\\sin(0)\\frac{\\cosh(\\dots)}{\\cosh(\\dots)}\\right] = T_0[0+0] = 0$. This matches BC $1$.\n2.  At $x=L$: $T(L,y) = T_0\\left[\\sin(\\pi)\\frac{\\cosh(\\dots)}{\\cosh(\\dots)} + \\frac{1}{2}\\sin(3\\pi)\\frac{\\cosh(\\dots)}{\\cosh(\\dots)}\\right] = T_0[0+0] = 0$. This matches BC $2$.\n3.  At $y=0$:\n    $T(x,0) = T_0\\left[\\sin\\!\\left(\\frac{\\pi x}{L}\\right)\\frac{\\cosh\\!\\left(\\frac{\\pi H}{L}\\right)}{\\cosh\\!\\left(\\frac{\\pi H}{L}\\right)} + \\frac{1}{2}\\sin\\!\\left(\\frac{3\\pi x}{L}\\right)\\frac{\\cosh\\!\\left(\\frac{3\\pi H}{L}\\right)}{\\cosh\\!\\left(\\frac{3\\pi H}{L}\\right)}\\right] = T_0\\left[\\sin\\!\\left(\\frac{\\pi x}{L}\\right) + \\frac{1}{2}\\sin\\!\\left(\\frac{3\\pi x}{L}\\right)\\right]$. This matches BC $3$.\n4.  At $y=H$: We require the derivative $\\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial y}$.\n    $\\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial y} = T_0\\left[\\sin\\!\\left(\\frac{\\pi x}{L}\\right)\\frac{-\\frac{\\pi}{L}\\sinh\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{L}(H-y)\\right)}{\\cosh\\left(\\frac{\\pi H}{L}\\right)} + \\frac{1}{2}\\sin\\!\\left(\\frac{3\\pi x}{L}\\right)\\frac{-\\frac{3\\pi}{L}\\sinh\\left(\\frac{3\\pi}{L}(H-y)\\right)}{\\cosh\\left(\\frac{3\\pi H}{L}\\right)}\\right]$.\n    Evaluating at $y=H$, we use the fact that $\\sinh(0)=0$:\n    $\\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial y}(x,H) = T_0\\left[\\sin\\!\\left(\\frac{\\pi x}{L}\\right) \\cdot 0 + \\frac{1}{2}\\sin\\!\\left(\\frac{3\\pi x}{L}\\right) \\cdot 0\\right] = 0$. This matches BC $4$.\n\nAll four boundary conditions are satisfied.\nFor corner continuity, the temperature at each corner is uniquely defined and consistent with the connecting boundary conditions.\n- $T(0,0) = 0$ (from BC $1$ and BC $3$).\n- $T(L,0) = 0$ (from BC $2$ and BC $3$).\n- $T(0,H) = 0$ (from BC $1$ and confirmed by the solution form).\n- $T(L,H) = 0$ (from BC $2$ and confirmed by the solution form).\nThe temperature field is continuous on the closed domain, including all corners.\n\n**Task 3: Computation of Heat Rate**\n\nThe total heat rate per unit thickness entering through the bottom boundary ($y=0$) is given by:\n$$ Q' = \\int_{0}^{L} q''_y(x,0) \\,dx = \\int_{0}^{L} \\left[-k\\,\\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial y}(x,0)\\right]\\,dx $$\nFirst, we evaluate the temperature gradient at $y=0$ using the derivative from Task 2:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial y}(x,0) = T_0\\left[\\sin\\!\\left(\\frac{\\pi x}{L}\\right)\\frac{-\\frac{\\pi}{L}\\sinh\\left(\\frac{\\pi H}{L}\\right)}{\\cosh\\left(\\frac{\\pi H}{L}\\right)} + \\frac{1}{2}\\sin\\!\\left(\\frac{3\\pi x}{L}\\right)\\frac{-\\frac{3\\pi}{L}\\sinh\\left(\\frac{3\\pi H}{L}\\right)}{\\cosh\\left(\\frac{3\\pi H}{L}\\right)}\\right] $$\nUsing the identity $\\tanh(z) = \\sinh(z)/\\cosh(z)$, this simplifies to:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial y}(x,0) = -T_0 \\left[ \\frac{\\pi}{L}\\tanh\\left(\\frac{\\pi H}{L}\\right)\\sin\\left(\\frac{\\pi x}{L}\\right) + \\frac{3\\pi}{2L}\\tanh\\left(\\frac{3\\pi H}{L}\\right)\\sin\\left(\\frac{3\\pi x}{L}\\right) \\right] $$\nNow, we substitute this expression into the integral for $Q'$:\n$$ Q' = -k \\int_{0}^{L} \\left( -T_0 \\left[ \\frac{\\pi}{L}\\tanh\\left(\\frac{\\pi H}{L}\\right)\\sin\\left(\\frac{\\pi x}{L}\\right) + \\frac{3\\pi}{2L}\\tanh\\left(\\frac{3\\pi H}{L}\\right)\\sin\\left(\\frac{3\\pi x}{L}\\right) \\right] \\right) dx $$\nSimplifying and separating the terms:\n$$ Q' = k T_0 \\left[ \\frac{\\pi}{L}\\tanh\\left(\\frac{\\pi H}{L}\\right)\\int_{0}^{L}\\sin\\left(\\frac{\\pi x}{L}\\right)dx + \\frac{3\\pi}{2L}\\tanh\\left(\\frac{3\\pi H}{L}\\right)\\int_{0}^{L}\\sin\\left(\\frac{3pi x}{L}\\right)dx \\right] $$\nWe evaluate the definite integrals:\n$$ \\int_{0}^{L}\\sin\\left(\\frac{\\pi x}{L}\\right)dx = \\left[-\\frac{L}{\\pi}\\cos\\left(\\frac{\\pi x}{L}\\right)\\right]_0^L = -\\frac{L}{\\pi}(\\cos(\\pi) - \\cos(0)) = -\\frac{L}{\\pi}(-1-1) = \\frac{2L}{\\pi} $$\n$$ \\int_{0}^{L}\\sin\\left(\\frac{3\\pi x}{L}\\right)dx = \\left[-\\frac{L}{3\\pi}\\cos\\left(\\frac{3\\pi x}{L}\\right)\\right]_0^L = -\\frac{L}{3\\pi}(\\cos(3\\pi) - \\cos(0)) = -\\frac{L}{3\\pi}(-1-1) = \\frac{2L}{3\\pi} $$\nSubstitute these results back into the expression for $Q'$:\n$$ Q' = k T_0 \\left[ \\frac{\\pi}{L}\\tanh\\left(\\frac{\\pi H}{L}\\right)\\left(\\frac{2L}{\\pi}\\right) + \\frac{3\\pi}{2L}\\tanh\\left(\\frac{3\\pi H}{L}\\right)\\left(\\frac{2L}{3\\pi}\\right) \\right] $$\nThe algebraic terms simplify, yielding the final expression for the heat rate:\n$$ Q' = k T_0 \\left[ 2\\tanh\\left(\\frac{\\pi H}{L}\\right) + \\tanh\\left(\\frac{3\\pi H}{L}\\right) \\right] $$\nThis is the symbolic, closed-form analytic expression for the total heat rate entering the plate per unit thickness through the boundary at $y=0$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{k T_0 \\left( 2\\tanh\\left(\\frac{\\pi H}{L}\\right) + \\tanh\\left(\\frac{3\\pi H}{L}\\right) \\right)}$$", "id": "2536562"}]}
