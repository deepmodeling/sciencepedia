Only the coefficients for $n=0$, which we denote $C_{m0}$, are non-zero.\n\nNow we analyze each statement.\n\nA. Because the initial data are independent of $y$ and the $y$-boundary conditions are homogeneous Neumann, only the $y$-eigenmode with index $n=0$ (the $y$-constant mode) is excited; consequently, $T(x,y,t)$ reduces to a one-dimensional series in $x$ multiplied by a $y$-constant function.\nAs derived above, the fact that the initial condition is independent of $y$ and the orthogonality of the cosine eigenfunctions under Neumann conditions causes all coefficients $C_{mn}$ for $n \\geq 1$ to be zero. Only the $n=0$ mode is excited. For $n=0$, the eigenfunction is $Y_0(y) = \\cos(0) = 1$, which is a constant function of $y$. The solution $T(x,y,t)$ thus becomes independent of $y$ and takes the form of a one-dimensional series, $T(x,y,t) = \\sum_{m=1}^{\\infty} C_{m0} \\sin(\\frac{m\\pi x}{L}) \\exp(-\\alpha (\\frac{m\\pi}{L})^2 t)$. This is a one-dimensional series in $x$ multiplied by the constant function $f(y)=1$.\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\nB. The eigenfunction series at $t=0$ converges pointwise to the prescribed initial profile for all $x\\in(0,L)$, including at $x=L/2$.\nThe prescribed initial profile is $T_0$ for $x \\in (0, L/2)$ and $-T_0$ for $x \\in (L/2, L)$. The profile is not defined at $x=L/2$. According to Dirichlet's theorem on Fourier series convergence, at a point of jump discontinuity, the series does not converge to either of the one-sided limits but to their arithmetic mean. The statement claims convergence to the *prescribed profile* for all $x \\in (0,L)$, which is false at the point $x=L/2$ where the function is not prescribed and at which the series converges to a value different from the limiting values $T_0$ and $-T_0$.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\nC. At the point $x=L/2$ (for any fixed $y\\in(0,H)$), the $t=0$ eigenfunction series converges to the arithmetic mean of the one-sided limits, namely $\\big(T_0+(-T_0)\\big)/2=0$.\nThis is a direct application of Dirichlet's convergence theorem for Fourier series. The initial condition $f(x) = T(x,y,0)$ is piecewise smooth with a jump discontinuity at $x=L/2$. The left-hand limit is $\\lim_{x\\to(L/2)^-} f(x) = T_0$, and the right-hand limit is $\\lim_{x\\to(L/2)^+} f(x) = -T_0$. The theorem states that the Fourier series converges to the average of these limits: $\\frac{1}{2}(T_0 + (-T_0)) = 0$. We can also verify this by inspecting the series terms, $\\sin(m\\pi(L/2)/L) = \\sin(m\\pi/2)$. This is non-zero for odd $m$. However, the initial function $T(x,y,0)-0$ is odd with respect to the point $x=L/2$. The basis functions $\\sin(m\\pi x/L)$ are either even (for $m$ odd) or odd (for $m$ even) about $x=L/2$. Thus, only basis functions with odd symmetry about $x=L/2$ (i.e. even $m$) will have non-zero coefficients. For all even $m$, $m=2k$, we have $\\sin(m\\pi(L/2)/L) = \\sin(k\\pi) = 0$. Thus, every term in the series is zero at $x=L/2$, and the sum is $0$.\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\nD. For partial sums of the $x$-series that approximate the initial profile (i.e., at $t=0$), the maximum overshoot immediately adjacent to $x=L/2$ approaches approximately $0.08949$ times the jump magnitude $2T_0$ as the number of retained $x$-modes tends to infinity.\nThis statement describes the Gibbs phenomenon. The initial condition is a square wave-like function with a jump of magnitude $J = T_0 - (-T_0) = 2T_0$. For a step discontinuity, the partial sums of the Fourier series overshoot the true value. The magnitude of this overshoot, relative to the total jump, is a universal constant. The maximum value of the partial sum near the jump at $x=L/2$ asymptotically approaches $T_0 + \\text{overshoot}$. The overshoot is given by $(\\frac{1}{\\pi} \\int_0^\\pi \\frac{\\sin(t)}{t} dt - \\frac{1}{2}) \\times J$. The integral is the sine integral $\\text{Si}(\\pi) \\approx 1.8519$. The overshoot is $(\\frac{1.8519}{\\pi} - \\frac{1}{2}) \\times (2T_0) \\approx (0.5894 - 0.5) \\times (2T_0) = 0.0894 \\times (2T_0)$. The statement says the overshoot approaches approximately $0.08949$ times the jump magnitude $2T_0$. This is the well-known value of the Gibbs constant.\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\nE. For any fixed $t>0$, the overshoot near $x=L/2$ in truncated series with $M$ $x$-modes does not decay as $M\\to\\infty$; that is, the Gibbs overshoot persists even after diffusion has acted.\nFor any time $t>0$, the solution contains the terms $\\exp(-\\alpha \\lambda_{m0}^2 t) = \\exp(-\\alpha (m\\pi/L)^2 t)$. This exponential term provides powerful damping for higher-frequency modes (large $m$). This ensures that for any fixed $t>0$, the series for $T(x,y,t)$ converges absolutely and uniformly for all $x \\in [0,L]$. Uniform convergence precludes the Gibbs phenomenon. The infinite smoothing property of the heat equation dictates that any initial discontinuity is immediately smoothed for any $t>0$. The solution $T(x,y,t)$ becomes an infinitely differentiable ($C^\\infty$) function of $x$ for $t>0$. Therefore, the Gibbs overshoot is a phenomenon strictly limited to $t=0$.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\nF. For small positive times $t>0$, the internal discontinuity is smoothed into a transition layer whose thickness scales like $\\sqrt{\\alpha t}$.\nThe heat equation is a diffusion equation. The characteristic length scale $\\delta$ over which a feature diffuses in a time $t$ is determined by the diffusivity $\\alpha$. Dimensional analysis shows that $\\alpha$ has units of $[length]^2/[time]$. Therefore, to form a length, we must have a relationship of the form $\\delta^2 \\propto \\alpha t$, which implies $\\delta \\propto \\sqrt{\\alpha t}$. This is a fundamental result of diffusion theory. An initial sharp discontinuity (modeled as a step function) evolves into a smooth profile (resembling an error function) whose width, or transition layer thickness, grows proportionally to $\\sqrt{\\alpha t}$.\nVerdict: **Correct**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{ACDF}$$", "id": "2508399"}]}
