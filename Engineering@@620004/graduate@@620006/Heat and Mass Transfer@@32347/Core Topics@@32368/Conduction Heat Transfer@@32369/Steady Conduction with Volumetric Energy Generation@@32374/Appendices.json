The differential statement of steady energy conservation with volumetric generation is given by:\n$$ \\nabla \\cdot \\vec{q} + q''' = 0 $$\nwhere $\\vec{q}$ is the heat flux vector and $q'''$ is the volumetric heat generation rate.\n\nFourier's law of heat conduction relates the heat flux to the temperature gradient:\n$$ \\vec{q} = -k \\nabla T $$\nwhere $k$ is the thermal conductivity.\n\nSubstituting Fourier's law into the energy conservation equation yields the general heat diffusion equation with generation:\n$$ \\nabla \\cdot (-k \\nabla T) + q''' = 0 $$\nGiven that the thermal conductivity $k$ is constant, it can be taken outside the divergence operator:\n$$ -k \\nabla \\cdot (\\nabla T) + q''' = 0 $$\n$$ k \\nabla^2 T + q''' = 0 $$\nFor a spherically symmetric system where temperature is a function only of the radial coordinate, $T = T(r)$, the Laplacian operator, $\\nabla^2$, in spherical coordinates simplifies to:\n$$ \\nabla^2 T = \\frac{1}{r^2} \\frac{d}{dr} \\left( r^2 \\frac{dT}{dr} \\right) $$\nSubstituting this into the heat diffusion equation gives the governing ordinary differential equation for $T(r)$:\n$$ \\frac{k}{r^2} \\frac{d}{dr} \\left( r^2 \\frac{dT}{dr} \\right) + q''' = 0 $$\nThis equation can be rearranged for integration:\n$$ \\frac{d}{dr} \\left( r^2 \\frac{dT}{dr} \\right) = -\\frac{q'''}{k} r^2 $$\nIntegrating with respect to $r$ gives:\n$$ r^2 \\frac{dT}{dr} = -\\frac{q'''}{3k} r^3 + C_1 $$\nwhere $C_1$ is the first constant of integration. The temperature gradient is then:\n$$ \\frac{dT}{dr} = -\\frac{q'''}{3k} r + \\frac{C_1}{r^2} $$\nThe first boundary condition is imposed at the center of the sphere, $r=0$. The problem specifies a \"finiteness/symmetry requirement.\" For a solid, homogeneous body, the temperature must be finite at the center. Furthermore, due to spherical symmetry, the heat flux at the center must be zero. Since $\\vec{q} = -k \\nabla T$, this requires that the temperature gradient $\\frac{dT}{dr}$ be zero at $r=0$. If $\\frac{dT}{dr}$ were non-zero at $r=0$, the heat flux would be infinite, which is physically impossible. Applying this condition:\n$$ \\frac{dT}{dr}\\bigg|_{r=0} = 0 \\implies 0 = -\\frac{q'''}{3k}(0) + \\frac{C_1}{0^2} $$\nThis equation can only be satisfied if $C_1 = 0$.

The faces are west face $w$ at $r_{3/2}$ and east face $e$ at $r_{5/2}$.\n$A_w = A_{3/2} = 2\\pi r_{3/2} L$, $A_e = A_{5/2} = 2\\pi r_{5/2} L$.\n$V_2 = \\pi(r_{5/2}^2 - r_{3/2}^2)L$.\nThe equation is: $(a_{W,2} + a_{E,2})T_2 = a_{W,2}T_1 + a_{E,2}T_3 + \\dot{q}^{\\prime\\prime\\prime}V_2$, where $a_{W,2} = \\frac{k A_{3/2}}{\\Delta r}$ and $a_{E,2} = \\frac{k A_{5/2}}{\\Delta r}$.\n\n2) **Innermost Control Volume (Node $i=1$)**:\nFor node $P=1$, the east neighbor is $E=2$. The west face is at the cylinder axis, $r_w=r_{1/2}=0$.\nThus, the west face area is $A_w = A_{1/2} = 0$. This correctly imposes the physical symmetry condition of zero heat flux at the centerline, $\\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial r}|_{r=0} = 0$, as the coefficient $a_W = \\frac{k A_w}{\\Delta r} = 0$.\nThe equation simplifies to $a_{P,1} T_1 = a_{E,1} T_2 + S_{u,1}$, where $a_{E,1} = \\frac{k A_{3/2}}{\\Delta r}$ and $a_{P,1} = a_{E,1}$.\nThe source term is $S_{u,1} = \\dot{q}^{\\prime\\prime\\prime} V_1 = \\dot{q}^{\\prime\\prime\\prime} \\pi r_{3/2}^2 L$.\n\n3) **Outermost Control Volume (Node $i=3$)**:\nFor node $P=3$, the west neighbor is $W=2$. The east face is the cylinder surface at $r_e=R=r_{7/2}$.\nThe heat rate leaving the east face is due to convection: $\\dot{Q}_e = \\dot{Q}_R = h A_R (T_s - T_{\\infty})$, where $A_R = 2\\pi R L$ and $T_s$ is the surface temperature at $r=R$.\nTo relate $T_s$ to the nodal temperature $T_3$, we equate the convective heat flux with the conductive heat flux reaching the surface. The conductive flux is approximated using a one-sided difference over the distance $\\Delta r / 2$ between node $3$ (at $r_3$) and the surface (at $R=r_3+\\Delta r/2$):\n$$ q_s = h(T_s - T_\\infty) = -k \\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial r}\\bigg|_{R} \\approx -k \\frac{T_s - T_3}{\\Delta r / 2} $$\nSolving for $T_s$ yields $T_s = \\frac{2k T_3 + h\\Delta r T_\\infty}{2k + h\\Delta r}$.\nThe heat rate leaving the surface is then expressed in terms of $T_3$ and $T_\\infty$:\n$$ \\dot{Q}_R = h A_R (T_s - T_\\infty) = h A_R \\left( \\frac{2k T_3 + h\\Delta r T_\\infty}{2k + h\\Delta r} - T_\\infty \\right) = \\frac{2kh A_R}{2k + h\\Delta r} (T_3 - T_\\infty) $$\nThis expression can be written as $\\dot{Q}_R = U(T_3-T_\\infty)$, where $U = \\frac{A_R}{1/h + \\Delta r/(2k)}$ is an effective heat transfer coefficient.\nThe energy balance for CV$3$ is $\\dot{Q}_R - \\dot{Q}_w = \\dot{q}^{\\prime\\prime\\prime} V_3$.\n$$ \\frac{2kh A_R}{2k + h\\Delta r} (T_3 - T_\\infty) - \\frac{k A_{5/2}}{\\Delta r} (T_3 - T_2) = \\dot{q}^{\\prime\\prime\\prime} V_3 $$\nRearranging to the standard form:\n$$ \\left( \\frac{k A_{5/2}}{\\Delta r} + \\frac{2kh A_R}{2k + h\\Delta r} \\right) T_3 = \\left( \\frac{k A_{5/2}}{\\Delta r} \\right) T_2 + \\dot{q}^{\\prime\\prime\\prime} V_3 + \\left( \\frac{2kh A_R}{2k + h\\Delta r} \\right) T_\\infty $$\nThis defines the coefficients $a_{P,3}$, $a_{W,3}$, and the source term for node $3$.\n\n**Numerical Solution**:\nGiven data: $R = 1.2\\times 10^{-3}$ m, $L = 1.0$ m, $N=3$, $k = 16$ W/m-K, $\\dot{q}^{\\prime\\prime\\prime} = 5.0\\times 10^{7}$ W/m$^3$, $h = 8000$ W/m$^2$-K, $T_{\\infty} = 300$ K.\nMesh parameters: $\\Delta r = R/N = 0.4\\times 10^{-3}$ m.\nFace radii: $r_{1/2}=0$, $r_{3/2}=0.4\\times 10^{-3}$ m, $r_{5/2}=0.8\\times 10^{-3}$ m, $r_{7/2}=R=1.2\\times 10^{-3}$ m.\nFace areas ($A=2\\pi rL$): $A_{3/2}=8\\pi \\times 10^{-4}$ m$^2$, $A_{5/2}=16\\pi \\times 10^{-4}$ m$^2$, $A_R=24\\pi \\times 10^{-4}$ m$^2$.\nVolumes ($V_i = \\pi(r_{i+1/2}^2-r_{i-1/2}^2)L$): $V_1 = 1.6\\pi \\times 10^{-7}$ m$^3$, $V_2 = 4.8\\pi \\times 10^{-7}$ m$^3$, $V_3 = 8.0\\pi \\times 10^{-7}$ m$^3$.\n\nCoefficients:\n$a_{E,1} = a_{W,2} = \\frac{k A_{3/2}}{\\Delta r} = \\frac{16 \\cdot 8\\pi \\times 10^{-4}}{0.4 \\times 10^{-3}} = 32\\pi$.\n$a_{E,2} = a_{W,3} = \\frac{k A_{5/2}}{\\Delta r} = \\frac{16 \\cdot 16\\pi \\times 10^{-4}}{0.4 \\times 10^{-3}} = 64\\pi$.\n$a_{P,1} = a_{E,1} = 32\\pi$.\n$a_{P,2} = a_{W,2} + a_{E,2} = 32\\pi + 64\\pi = 96\\pi$.\nBoundary coefficient: $C_b = \\frac{2kh A_R}{2k + h\\Delta r} = \\frac{2(16)(8000)(24\\pi \\times 10^{-4})}{2(16) + 8000(0.4 \\times 10^{-3})} = \\frac{6144\\pi}{32+3.2} = \\frac{6144\\pi}{35.2} = \\frac{192\\pi}{1.1} = \\frac{1920\\pi}{11}$.\nWait, let's use the other form $U = \\frac{A_R}{(\\Delta r/2k) + 1/h} = \\frac{24\\pi \\times 10^{-4}}{(0.4 \\times 10^{-3})/(2 \\cdot 16) + 1/8000} = \\frac{24\\pi \\times 10^{-4}}{1.25\\times 10^{-5} + 1.25\\times 10^{-4}} = \\frac{24\\pi \\times 10^{-4}}{1.375\\times 10^{-4}} = \\frac{24\\pi}{1.375} = \\frac{192\\pi}{11}$.
