It is a valid problem in the field of heat transfer. I will proceed with the analysis.\n\nFirst, we derive the governing differential equation. Consider a differential element of the fin of length $dx$ at a distance $x$ from the base. An energy balance under steady-state conditions states that the rate of heat conducted into the element at $x$ must equal the sum of the heat conducted out at $x+dx$ and the heat convected from the surface of the element.\n$$Q_x = Q_{x+dx} + dQ_{\\text{conv}}$$\nUsing Fourier's law of conduction, $Q_x = -k A_c \\frac{dT}{dx}$, where $k$ is the thermal conductivity and $A_c$ is the cross-sectional area. The heat exiting at $x+dx$ is given by a Taylor series expansion:\n$$Q_{x+dx} = Q_x + \\frac{dQ_x}{dx}dx = -k A_c \\frac{dT}{dx} - k A_c \\frac{d^2T}{dx^2}dx$$\nThe heat lost by convection from the differential surface area $dA_s = Pdx$, where $P$ is the perimeter, is given by Newton's law of cooling:\n$$dQ_{\\text{conv}} = h (Pdx) (T(x) - T_{\\infty})$$\nSubstituting these expressions into the energy balance yields:\n$$-k A_c \\frac{dT}{dx} = \\left(-k A_c \\frac{dT}{dx} - k A_c \\frac{d^2T}{dx^2}dx\\right) + h P dx (T - T_{\\infty})$$\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\n$$k A_c \\frac{d^2T}{dx^2} - h P (T - T_{\\infty}) = 0$$\nLet us define an excess temperature $\\theta(x) = T(x) - T_{\\infty}$. Since $T_{\\infty}$ is a constant, we have $\\frac{d\\theta}{dx} = \\frac{dT}{dx}$ and $\\frac{d^2\\theta}{dx^2} = \\frac{d^2T}{dx^2}$. The equation becomes:\n$$\\frac{d^2\\theta}{dx^2} - \\frac{hP}{kA_c}\\theta = 0$$\nWe define the fin parameter $m = \\sqrt{\\frac{hP}{kA_c}}$. The governing ordinary differential equation is:\n$$\\frac{d^2\\theta}{dx^2} - m^2\\theta = 0$$\nThe general solution to this second-order homogeneous linear ODE is:\n$$\\theta(x) = C_1 \\cosh(mx) + C_2 \\sinh(mx)$$\nWe apply the two boundary conditions to find the constants $C_1$ and $C_2$.\n1.

For small $z$, $\\tanh(z) \\approx z - z^3/3 + \\dots$.\nFin efficiency $\\eta_f$:\n$$\\eta_f = \\frac{\\tanh(mL)}{mL} \\approx \\frac{mL}{mL} = 1$$\nNumerically, $\\eta_f = \\frac{\\tanh(0.010954)}{0.010954} \\approx \\frac{0.010954}{0.010954} \\approx 0.99996$. So, the fin is almost perfectly efficient.\n\nFin effectiveness $\\epsilon_f$:\n$$\\epsilon_f = \\sqrt{\\frac{Pk}{hA_c}}\\tanh(mL)$$\nThe term under the square root is:\n$$\\frac{Pk}{hA_c} = \\frac{(0.240)(400)}{(100)(0.002)} = \\frac{96}{0.2} = 480$$\n$$\\epsilon_f = \\sqrt{480} \\tanh(0.002\\sqrt{30}) \\approx 21.9089 \\times \\tanh(0.010954) \\approx 21.9089 \\times 0.010954 \\approx 0.2400$$\nUsing the approximation $\\tanh(mL) \\approx mL$, we get:\n$$\\epsilon_f \\approx \\sqrt{\\frac{Pk}{hA_c}} (mL) = \\sqrt{\\frac{Pk}{hA_c}} \\left(\\sqrt{\\frac{hP}{kA_c}}L\\right) = \\sqrt{\\frac{P^2 L^2}{A_c^2}} = \\frac{PL}{A_c}$$\n$$\\epsilon_f \\approx \\frac{(0.240)(0.002)}{0.002} = 0.2400$$\nThe numerical value of the fin effectiveness, rounded to four significant figures, is $0.2400$.\n\nPhysical interpretation:\nA high fin efficiency ($\\eta_f \\approx 1$) indicates that the temperature of the fin is nearly uniform and equal to the base temperature, $T(x) \\approx T_b$. This occurs because the fin is \"thermally short\" ($mL \\ll 1$), which in this case is due to both a very short physical length $L$ and a very high thermal conductivity $k$. The thermal resistance to conduction along the fin is negligible compared to the thermal resistance of convection from its surface. Consequently, the fin transfers heat at nearly its maximum possible rate for its given surface area.\n\nHowever, a fin effectiveness of $\\epsilon_f  1$ indicates that the fin is detrimental to heat transfer. It removes less heat than the bare wall surface it covers. The purpose of a fin is to increase the surface area available for convection. The effectiveness can be expressed as $\\epsilon_f = \\eta_f \\frac{A_f}{A_c}$, where $A_f=PL$ is the fin surface area and $A_c=wt$ is the base area it covers.\nIn this problem, $\\eta_f \\approx 1$, so $\\epsilon_f \\approx \\frac{A_f}{A_c} = \\frac{PL}{wt}$.\nThe fin surface area is $A_f = (0.240)(0.002) = 0.00048\\,\\mathrm{m}^2$.\nThe base area is $A_c = 0.002\\,\\mathrm{m}^2$.\nThe ratio is $\\frac{A_f}{A_c} = \\frac{0.00048}{0.002} = 0.24$.\nThe fin is so short and thick that the convective surface area it adds ($A_f$) is only $24\\%$ of the base area it obstructs ($A_c$). Even though this small added area operates at maximum thermal potential (high efficiency), the total heat transfer is significantly less than what would occur from the larger, unobstructed base area. This design is an example of an \"insulating fin\". For a fin to be advantageous, its effectiveness must be greater than $1$, which generally requires $A_f \\gg A_c$. This problem illustrates that high efficiency does not guarantee high effectiveness, and that effectiveness is the primary criterion for judging the utility of a fin.", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{0.2400} $$", "id": "2483887"}, {"introduction": "Having established that fin effectiveness, $\\epsilon_f$, is a critical measure of whether a fin enhances heat transfer, we now question if it is a sufficient metric for design.

Critique of $\\epsilon_f$ as a Sole Metric**\nThe relationship between $R$ and $\\epsilon_f$ can be formally derived:\n$$R = \\frac{Q}{Q_0} = \\frac{h(A_p - N A_b)\\Theta_b + N q_f}{h A_p \\Theta_b} = 1 - \\frac{N A_b}{A_p} + \\frac{N q_f}{h A_p \\Theta_b}$$\nSubstituting $q_f = \\epsilon_f h A_b \\Theta_b$:\n$$R = 1 - \\frac{N A_b}{A_p} + \\frac{N (\\epsilon_f h A_b \\Theta_b)}{h A_p \\Theta_b} = 1 - \\frac{N A_b}{A_p} + \\epsilon_f \\frac{N A_b}{A_p}$$\n$$R = 1 + (\\epsilon_f - 1)\\left(\\frac{N A_b}{A_p}\\right)$$\nThis equation shows that the enhancement ratio $R$ depends not only on the fin effectiveness $\\epsilon_f$, but also critically on the total fin footprint fraction, $\\frac{N A_b}{A_p}$. In our case, this fraction is exceedingly small:\n$$\\frac{N A_b}{A_p} = \\frac{10 \\times (5.0 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{m}^2)}{1.000\\,\\mathrm{m}^2} = 5.0 \\times 10^{-5}$$\nUsing the derived formula:\n$$R = 1 + (82.2 - 1)(5.0 \\times 10^{-5}) = 1 + (81.2)(5.0 \\times 10^{-5}) = 1 + 0.00406 = 1.00406$$\nThe calculation is consistent. The counterexample is successful: a very high fin effectiveness ($\\epsilon_f \\approx 82$) leads to a negligible overall heat transfer enhancement ($R \\approx 1.004$) because the fins occupy a minuscule fraction of the total available surface area.\n\n**Evaluation of Options**\n\nA. A large fin effectiveness $\\epsilon_f \\gg 1$ guarantees a large percentage increase in plate heat transfer, regardless of how small the fin footprint area is relative to the plate area.\nThis statement is demonstrably false. Our numerical calculation provides a direct counterexample: $\\epsilon_f \\approx 82$, which is much greater than $1$, yet the percentage increase in heat transfer is only $0.4\\%$. The derived relation $R = 1 + (\\epsilon_f - 1)(N A_b/A_p)$ proves that the enhancement is proportional to the footprint fraction, which this statement incorrectly neglects.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\nB. Even if $\\epsilon_f \\gg 1$ for each fin, the overall enhancement $R$ can be arbitrarily close to $1$ when the total fin footprint fraction $N A_b/A_p$ is very small; thus $\\epsilon_f$ alone is not a sufficient design metric.\nThis statement accurately reflects the findings of our analysis. The formula $R = 1 + (\\epsilon_f - 1)(N A_b/A_p)$ shows that if the footprint fraction $N A_b/A_p$ approaches zero, the enhancement term $(\\epsilon_f - 1)(N A_b/A_p)$ also approaches zero, and $R$ approaches $1$. This confirms that high effectiveness is a necessary but not sufficient condition for significant heat transfer enhancement; the area coverage is also a critical factor.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\nC. Whenever $\\epsilon_f  1$ for each fin, the overall surface efficiency of the finned plate must exceed $0.90$.\nThe overall surface efficiency is $\\eta_o = Q/Q_{max}$, where $Q_{max} = h A_{total} \\Theta_b$ and $A_{total}$ is the total exposed area, $A_{total} = (A_p - N A_b) + N A_f$.

Consider a very long fin made of a poor conductor, such that its fin efficiency $\\eta_f = q_f/(h A_f \\Theta_b)$ is low. For example, let $\\eta_f = 0.5$. The overall efficiency can be written as $\\eta_o = 1 - \\frac{N A_f}{A_{total}}(1-\\eta_f)$. If we cover a large fraction of the base with fins, e.g., $\\frac{N A_f}{A_{total}} = 0.9$, then $\\eta_o = 1 - 0.9(1-0.5) = 1 - 0.45 = 0.55$, which is less than $0.90$. We must ensure $\\epsilon_f  1$ in this case. $\\epsilon_f = \\eta_f (A_f/A_b)$. For a fin where the ratio of surface area to base area $A_f/A_b$ is large (e.g., $A_f/A_b = 20$), we would have $\\epsilon_f = 0.5 \\times 20 = 10  1$. Thus, it is possible to have $\\epsilon_f  1$ while $\\eta_o  0.90$.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\nD. Ranking fin arrays for a fixed convection environment should be based solely on $\\epsilon_f$; the added surface area and base-area occupancy can be neglected in the comparison.\nThis statement is equivalent to the fallacy addressed by the problem. As shown by the relation $R = 1 + (\\epsilon_f - 1)(N A_b/A_p)$, neglecting base-area occupancy ($N A_b$) and added surface area (which influences $\\epsilon_f$) leads to an incomplete and often incorrect assessment of performance.

It is a standard problem in the analysis of extended surfaces (fins) and can be solved using fundamental principles of heat transfer. We will proceed with the solution.\n\nFirst, we derive the general one-dimensional, steady-state fin equation. Consider a differential element of the fin of length $dx$ located at a distance $x$ from the base. An energy balance on this element under steady-state conditions dictates that the rate of heat conduction into the element must equal the sum of the rate of heat conduction out of the element and the rate of heat convection from the element's surface.\n$$q_x = q_{x+dx} + dq_{\\text{conv}}$$\nUsing a Taylor series expansion for the heat conduction rate at $x+dx$, we have $q_{x+dx} = q_x + \\frac{dq_x}{dx}dx$. The energy balance becomes:\n$$-\\frac{dq_x}{dx}dx - dq_{\\text{conv}} = 0$$\nAccording to Fourier's law of conduction, the heat rate is $q_x = -k A_c(x) \\frac{dT}{dx}$, where $A_c(x) = w t(x)$ is the local cross-sectional area. The heat loss by convection from the differential surface area $dA_s = 2w dx$ is given by Newton's law of cooling, $dq_{\\text{conv}} = h dA_s (T - T_{\\infty}) = h (2w dx) (T - T_{\\infty})$.\nSubstituting these into the energy balance gives:\n$$-\\frac{d}{dx}\\left(-k w t(x) \\frac{dT}{dx}\\right)dx - h(2w dx)(T - T_{\\infty}) = 0$$\nDividing by $w dx$ and defining the excess temperature $\\theta(x) = T(x) - T_{\\infty}$, which implies $\\frac{d\\theta}{dx} = \\frac{dT}{dx}$, we obtain the general governing equation for a fin with variable thickness:\n$$\\frac{d}{dx}\\left(k t(x) \\frac{d\\theta}{dx}\\right) - 2h\\theta = 0$$\nSince thermal conductivity $k$ is constant, this simplifies to:\n$$\\frac{d}{dx}\\left(t(x) \\frac{d\\theta}{dx}\\right) - \\frac{2h}{k}\\theta = 0$$\nThe boundary conditions are an isothermal base, $\\theta(0) = \\theta_b$, and a condition at the tip, $x=L$.\n\nThe equal-mass constraint for all three geometries is $M = \\rho \\int_0^{L_g} A_{c,g}(x) dx = \\rho w \\int_0^{L_g} t_g(x) dx$.
