It presents a classical problem in transient heat transfer that is suitable for dimensional analysis. All necessary physical parameters and conditions are provided, and there are no internal contradictions or violations of fundamental principles. The problem is valid.\n\nThe temperature distribution $T(x,t)$ within the slab is governed by the principles of conservation of energy (leading to the one-dimensional heat equation), Fourier's law of heat conduction, and Newton's law of cooling for the boundary condition. The full set of variables and parameters that describe the phenomenon is: the dependent variable, temperature $T$, which is a function of position $x$ and time $t$; the initial temperature $T_i$; the ambient fluid temperature $T_\\infty$; the slab half-thickness $L$; and the material properties: thermal conductivity $k$, density $\\rho$, specific heat capacity $c_p$, and the surface heat transfer coefficient $h$.\n\nThe governing partial differential equation and boundary conditions are linear with respect to temperature. This linearity implies that the principle of superposition applies. A crucial consequence is that the solution depends not on the absolute temperatures $T$, $T_i$, and $T_\\infty$, but on their differences. We can define a normalized, dimensionless temperature, $\\Theta$, as:\n$$ \\Theta = \\frac{T(x,t) - T_\\infty}{T_i - T_\\infty} $$\nBecause of the linearity and the uniform initial condition, this dimensionless temperature $\\Theta$ must be independent of the initial temperature difference $T_i - T_\\infty$. This key step constitutes the reduction in complexity mentioned in the problem statement. By framing the problem in terms of $\\Theta$, we have combined the three temperature-related quantities ($T$, $T_i$, $T_\\infty$) into a single dimensionless dependent variable.\n\nThe problem now is to determine the dimensionless groups that govern $\\Theta$. The physical parameters that $\\Theta$ depends upon are:\n1. Position, $x$\n2. Time, $t$\n3. Slab half-thickness, $L$\n4. Heat transfer coefficient, $h$\n5. Thermal conductivity, $k$\n6. Density, $\\rho$\n7. Specific heat capacity, $c_p$\n\nWe apply the Buckingham $\\Pi$ theorem to this set of $n=7$ parameters. The fundamental dimensions involved are Mass ($M$), Length ($L$), Time ($t$), and Temperature ($K$). Thus, the number of fundamental dimensions is $j=4$.\nThe dimensions of the parameters are:\n- Position $[x] = L$\n- Time $[t] = t$\n- Half-thickness $[L] = L$\n- Heat transfer coefficient $[h] = \\frac{M}{t^3 K}$\n- Thermal conductivity $[k] = \\frac{M L}{t^3 K}$\n- Density $[\\rho] = \\frac{M}{L^3}$\n- Specific heat capacity $[c_p] = \\frac{L^2}{t^2 K}$\n\nAccording to the Buckingham $\\Pi$ theorem, the number of independent dimensionless groups ($\\Pi$ groups) is $k = n - j = 7 - 4 = 3$. The solution for the dimensionless temperature $\\Theta$ can therefore be expressed as a function of these three groups:\n$$ \\Theta = f(\\Pi_1, \\Pi_2, \\Pi_3) $$\nTo find these groups, we select a set of $j=4$ repeating variables from our list that, combined, contain all fundamental dimensions and are dimensionally independent.

This implies $d = -1 - (-1) = 0$. From $M$, $1 + (-1) + c = 0$, so $c=0$.

We introduce a fictitious \"image\" source in the region $y<0$. For an insulated boundary (zero derivative), the image source must have the same sign and magnitude as the real source and be located at the mirror-image position with respect to the boundary. The real source is at $(0, a)$, so the image source is placed at $(0, -a)$.\n\nThe temperature field from this image source, as if it were in an infinite medium, is:\n$$ T_{\\text{image}}(x,y,t) = \\frac{Q'}{4 \\pi \\rho c \\alpha t} \\exp\\left( - \\frac{x^2 + (y - (-a))^2}{4 \\alpha t} \\right) = \\frac{Q'}{4 \\pi \\rho c \\alpha t} \\exp\\left( - \\frac{x^2 + (y+a)^2}{4 \\alpha t} \\right) $$\nThe total temperature field $T(x,y,t)$ in the physical domain $y \\ge 0$ is the superposition of the fields from the real source and the image source:\n$$ T(x,y,t) = T_{\\text{source}}(x,y,t) + T_{\\text{image}}(x,y,t) $$\n$$ T(x,y,t) = \\frac{Q'}{4 \\pi \\rho c \\alpha t} \\left[ \\exp\\left( - \\frac{x^2 + (y-a)^2}{4 \\alpha t} \\right) + \\exp\\left( - \\frac{x^2 + (y+a)^2}{4 \\alpha t} \\right) \\right] $$\nThis constructed solution satisfies the governing heat equation (as it is a sum of two solutions) and the initial condition. We must verify that it also satisfies the boundary condition:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial y} = \\frac{Q'}{4 \\pi \\rho c \\alpha t} \\left[ \\exp\\left( - \\frac{x^2 + (y-a)^2}{4 \\alpha t} \\right)\\left(\\frac{-2(y-a)}{4 \\alpha t}\\right) + \\exp\\left( - \\frac{x^2 + (y+a)^2}{4 \\alpha t} \\right)\\left(\\frac{-2(y+a)}{4 \\alpha t}\\right) \\right] $$\nEvaluating this derivative at $y=0$:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial y} \\bigg|_{y=0} = \\frac{Q'}{4 \\pi \\rho c \\alpha t} \\frac{-2}{4 \\alpha t} \\left[ (-a)\\exp\\left( - \\frac{x^2 + a^2}{4 \\alpha t} \\right) + (a)\\exp\\left( - \\frac{x^2 + a^2}{4 \\alpha t} \\right) \\right] = 0 $$\nThe boundary condition is satisfied. The constructed solution is correct.\n\nFinally, we determine the temperature rise at the specified point $(x,y)=(0,0)$ for $t>0$. Since the initial temperature was zero, the temperature $T$ is the temperature rise $\\Delta T$. We substitute $x=0$ and $y=0$ into the solution:\n$$ \\Delta T(0,0,t) = T(0,0,t) = \\frac{Q'}{4 \\pi \\rho c \\alpha t} \\left[ \\exp\\left( - \\frac{0^2 + (0-a)^2}{4 \\alpha t} \\right) + \\exp\\left( - \\frac{0^2 + (0+a)^2}{4 \\alpha t} \\right) \\right] $$\n$$ T(0,0,t) = \\frac{Q'}{4 \\pi \\rho c \\alpha t} \\left[ \\exp\\left( - \\frac{a^2}{4 \\alpha t} \\right) + \\exp\\left( - \\frac{a^2}{4 \\alpha t} \\right) \\right] $$\n$$ T(0,0,t) = \\frac{Q'}{4 \\pi \\rho c \\alpha t} \\left[ 2 \\exp\\left( - \\frac{a^2}{4 \\alpha t} \\right) \\right] $$\nSimplifying the expression gives the final answer:\n$$ T(0,0,t) = \\frac{Q'}{2 \\pi \\rho c \\alpha t} \\exp\\left( - \\frac{a^2}{4 \\alpha t} \\right) $$", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{\\frac{Q'}{2 \\pi \\rho c \\alpha t} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{a^2}{4 \\alpha t}\\right)} $$", "id": "2526153"}]}
