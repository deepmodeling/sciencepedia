It is therefore deemed valid. We shall proceed with the derivation as requested, following the specified steps.\n\nFirst, we derive the governing partial differential equation from the local conservation of energy and Fourier's law of conduction. Consider a one-dimensional control volume of infinitesimal thickness $dx$ and cross-sectional area $A$. The conservation of energy states that the rate of energy accumulation within the volume is equal to the net rate of heat conducted into it.\nThe rate of heat conduction into the control volume at position $x$ is $q(x,t) = A q_x''(x,t)$, and the rate of heat conduction out of the control volume at position $x+dx$ is $q(x+dx, t) = A q_x''(x+dx, t)$. The rate of change of internal energy stored within the volume is $\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t}(\\rho A \\,dx\\, c T)$, where $\\rho$ is the density, $c$ is the specific heat, and $T$ is the temperature.\nThe energy balance is thus:\n$$A q_x''(x,t) - A q_x''(x+dx,t) = \\rho c A \\,dx \\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial t}$$\nDividing by $A \\,dx$ and taking the limit as $dx \\to 0$:\n$$-\\frac{\\partial q_x''}{\\partial x} = \\rho c \\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial t}$$\nAccording to Fourier's law of heat conduction, the heat flux $q_x''$ is proportional to the negative temperature gradient: $q_x'' = -k \\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial x}$, where $k$ is the thermal conductivity. Substituting this into the energy balance gives:\n$$-\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}\\left(-k \\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial x}\\right) = \\rho c \\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial t}$$\nFor constant thermal conductivity $k$, this simplifies to the one-dimensional heat equation:\n$$k \\frac{\\partial^2 T}{\\partial x^2} = \\rho c \\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial t}$$\n$$ \\implies \\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial t} = \\alpha \\frac{\\partial^2 T}{\\partial x^2} $$\nwhere $\\alpha = k/(\\rho c)$ is the thermal diffusivity.\n\nThe initial and boundary conditions are specified by the problem statement:\n1.

It describes a canonical problem in transient heat conduction and provides all necessary information for its solution. Therefore, the problem is valid, and we may proceed with the derivation and solution.\n\nFirst, we derive the governing differential equation from fundamental principles. We consider one-dimensional heat conduction in the $x$-direction. The principle of energy conservation applied to a differential control volume of thickness $dx$ and cross-sectional area $A$ states that the rate of energy storage within the volume is equal to the net rate of heat conduction into the volume.\n\nThe rate of energy storage is given by $\\rho c (A \\, dx) \\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial t}$, where $\\rho$ is the density, $c$ is the specific heat, and $\\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial t}$ is the rate of temperature change.\n\nThe net rate of heat conduction is the difference between the heat rate entering at $x$, $q_x$, and the heat rate leaving at $x+dx$, $q_{x+dx}$. Thus, the net rate is $q_x - q_{x+dx}$.\n\nAccording to Fourier's law of heat conduction, the heat rate is proportional to the negative temperature gradient: $q = -kA \\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial x}$, where $k$ is the thermal conductivity.\nSo, $q_x = -kA \\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial x} \\Big|_x$ and $q_{x+dx} = -kA \\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial x} \\Big|_{x+dx}$.\nThe term $q_{x+dx}$ can be expressed using a Taylor series expansion around $x$: $q_{x+dx} = q_x + \\frac{\\partial q_x}{\\partial x} dx + \\dots$.\nThe net heat rate is then $q_x - q_{x+dx} \\approx -\\frac{\\partial q_x}{\\partial x} dx = -\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} \\left(-kA \\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial x}\\right) dx = kA \\frac{\\partial^2 T}{\\partial x^2} dx$, assuming $k$ is constant.\n\nEquating the rate of energy storage with the net rate of heat conduction:\n$$ \\rho c (A \\, dx) \\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial t} = kA \\frac{\\partial^2 T}{\\partial x^2} dx $$\nDividing by $A \\, dx$ and $\\rho c$, we obtain the one-dimensional transient heat conduction equation:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial t} = \\frac{k}{\\rho c} \\frac{\\partial^2 T}{\\partial x^2} $$\nWe define the thermal diffusivity as $\\alpha = \\frac{k}{\\rho c}$, so the governing equation is:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial t} = \\alpha \\frac{\\partial^2 T}{\\partial x^2} $$\n\nThe problem is defined for a material $j$ with thermal diffusivity $\\alpha_j$.

This suggests that the solution may be self-similar, meaning the temperature profile at different times looks the same when spatial and temporal coordinates are scaled appropriately. We seek a solution of the form $\\theta(x, t) = f(\\eta)$, where $\\eta$ is a dimensionless similarity variable. From dimensional analysis, $x$ has units of length $[L]$ and $t$ has units of time $[T]$. The thermal diffusivity $\\alpha_j$ has units of $[L^2/T]$. A dimensionless combination must be of the form $x^a t^b \\alpha_j^c$. To be dimensionless, we must have $a+2c=0$ and $b-c=0$. A simple choice is $c=-1/2$, leading to $a=1$ and $b=-1/2$.

The boundary at $x=0$ is subjected to a time-dependent Dirichlet condition that instantaneously switches the surface temperature to a higher constant value for a finite time and then reverts to the initial temperature: $T(0,t) = T_s$ for $0<t<\\tau$ and $T(0,t) = T_i$ for $t>\\tau$. Far from the boundary, the undisturbed initial state is maintained, so $T(x\\to\\infty,t) = T_i$ for all $t \\ge 0$.\n\nStarting from the governing equation and boundary and initial conditions, and using only fundamental principles (energy conservation and Fourier’s law) and core definitions, derive the exact expression for $T(x,t)$ for all $t \\ge 0$ at an arbitrary fixed depth $x>0$ under the described switching boundary condition.

Round your final numerical answer to four significant figures. Express the final temperature in degrees Celsius.", "solution": "The problem as stated is scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and contains all necessary information for a unique solution. It is a standard problem in the field of transient heat transfer. Therefore, it is deemed valid, and we shall proceed to its solution.\n\nThe problem concerns one-dimensional transient heat conduction in a semi-infinite solid ($x \\ge 0$), governed by the heat equation:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial t} = \\alpha \\frac{\\partial^2 T}{\\partial x^2}\n$$\nThe initial and boundary conditions are:\n$1$. Initial condition: $T(x,0) = T_i$ for $x \\ge 0$.\n$2$. Boundary condition at the surface: $T(0,t) = T_s$ for $0 < t < \\tau$, and $T(0,t) = T_i$ for $t > \\tau$.\n$3$. Boundary condition far from the surface: $T(x \\to \\infty, t) = T_i$ for $t \\ge 0$.\n\nTo simplify the problem, we introduce a dimensionless temperature, $\\theta(x,t)$, defined as:\n$$\n\\theta(x,t) = \\frac{T(x,t) - T_i}{T_s - T_i}\n$$\nThe governing equation and conditions in terms of $\\theta$ are:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial \\theta}{\\partial t} = \\alpha \\frac{\\partial^2 \\theta}{\\partial x^2}\n$$\n$1$. Initial condition: $\\theta(x,0) = 0$ for $x \\ge 0$.\n$2$. Boundary condition at the surface: $\\theta(0,t) = 1$ for $0 < t < \\tau$, and $\\theta(0,t) = 0$ for $t > \\tau$.\n$3$. Boundary condition far from the surface: $\\theta(x \\to \\infty, t) = 0$ for $t \\ge 0$.\n\nThe heat equation is linear. Therefore, we can use the principle of superposition to solve for the complex, time-dependent boundary condition. The condition at $x=0$ can be represented as the sum of two step-changes:\na) A step increase of magnitude $1$ at time $t=0$.\nb) A step decrease of magnitude $1$ (i.e., a change of $-1$) at time $t=\\tau$.\n\nThe fundamental solution for the heat equation in a semi-infinite solid, initially at $\\theta=0$, subjected to a unit step change in surface temperature ($\\theta(0,t)=1$) at $t=0$, is a standard result obtained through methods such as similarity transformation or Laplace transforms. This solution is given in terms of the complementary error function, $\\operatorname{erfc}$:\n$$\n\\theta_{step}(x,t) = \\operatorname{erfc}\\left(\\frac{x}{\\sqrt{4\\alpha t}}\\right)\n$$\nUsing superposition, the solution for $\\theta(x,t)$ is the sum of the effects from the two step changes. The effect from step (a) is $\\theta_{step}(x,t)$. The effect from step (b) is a negative step of the same form, but shifted in time by $\\tau$, which is $- \\theta_{step}(x, t-\\tau)$. This second term is only active for $t > \\tau$, which can be formally included using the Heaviside step function $H(t-\\tau)$.\n\nThe complete solution for the dimensionless temperature is:\n$$\n\\theta(x,t) = \\operatorname{erfc}\\left(\\frac{x}{\\sqrt{4\\alpha t}}\\right) - \\operatorname{erfc}\\left(\\frac{x}{\\sqrt{4\\alpha(t-\\tau)}}\\right) H(t-\\tau)\n$$\n\nThis provides the exact expression for the temperature profile $T(x,t) = T_i + (T_s - T_i)\\theta(x,t)$ for all $t \\ge 0$:\nFor $0 < t \\le \\tau$:\n$$\nT(x,t) = T_i + (T_s - T_i) \\operatorname{erfc}\\left(\\frac{x}{\\sqrt{4\\alpha t}}\\right)\n$$\nFor $t > \\tau$:\n$$\nT(x,t) = T_i + (T_s - T_i) \\left[ \\operatorname{erfc}\\left(\\frac{x}{\\sqrt{4\\alpha t}}\\right) - \\operatorname{erfc}\\left(\\frac{x}{\\sqrt{4\\alpha (t-\\tau)}}\\right) \\right]\n$$\nThis expression can also be written using the error function, $\\operatorname{erf}(z) = 1 - \\operatorname{erfc}(z)$. For $t > \\tau$:\n$$\nT(x,t) = T_i + (T_s - T_i) \\left[ \\operatorname{erf}\\left(\\frac{x}{\\sqrt{4\\alpha (t-\\tau)}}\\right) - \\operatorname{erf}\\left(\\frac{x}{\\sqrt{4\\alpha t}}\\right) \\right]\n$$\nNow, we must find the maximum temperature $T_{max}$ at the fixed depth $x = x^*$ for all $t \\ge 0$.\nFirst, consider the interval $0 < t \\le \\tau$. The argument of the complementary error function, $z(t) = x^*/\\sqrt{4\\alpha t}$, is a decreasing function of $t$. Since $\\operatorname{erfc}(z)$ is a monotonically decreasing function of its argument $z$, it follows that $\\operatorname{erfc}(z(t))$ is a monotonically increasing function of $t$. Since $T_s > T_i$, the temperature $T(x^*,t)$ is strictly increasing throughout the interval $0 < t \\le \\tau$.\n\nNext, consider the interval $t > \\tau$. To find a potential maximum, we must analyze the sign of the time derivative $\\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial t}$. Let $A = (x^*)^2/(4\\alpha)$.\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial t} = (T_s - T_i) \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t} \\left[ \\operatorname{erf}\\left(\\sqrt{\\frac{A}{t-\\tau}}\\right) - \\operatorname{erf}\\left(\\sqrt{\\frac{A}{t}}\\right) \\right]\n$$\nUsing the chain rule and the derivative of the error function, $\\frac{d}{dz}\\operatorname{erf}(z) = \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{\\pi}}\\exp(-z^2)$, we get:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial t} = (T_s - T_i) \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{\\pi}} \\left[ \\exp\\left(-\\frac{A}{t-\\tau}\\right) \\left(-\\frac{1}{2}\\sqrt{A}(t-\\tau)^{-3/2}\\right) - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{A}{t}\\right) \\left(-\\frac{1}{2}\\sqrt{A}t^{-3/2}\\right) \\right]\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial t} = -(T_s - T_i) \\sqrt{\\frac{A}{\\pi}} \\left[ \\frac{\\exp(-A/(t-\\tau))}{(t-\\tau)^{3/2}} - \\frac{\\exp(-A/t)}{t^{3/2}} \\right]\n$$\nLet us analyze the function $F(y) = y^{-3/2}\\exp(-A/y)$. The expression in the brackets is $F(t-\\tau) - F(t)$.\nThe derivative of $F(y)$ is $\\frac{dF}{dy} = y^{-7/2}\\exp(-A/y) (A - \\frac{3}{2}y)$.\nThis derivative is zero when $y = 2A/3$. The function $F(y)$ has a single maximum at $y = 2A/3$ and is strictly decreasing for $y > 2A/3$.\nLet's compute the value of $2A/3$ with the given parameters:\n$A = \\frac{(x^*)^2}{4\\alpha} = \\frac{(5.0 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{m})^2}{4 \\times (1.0 \\times 10^{-5}\\,\\mathrm{m^2/s})} = \\frac{25 \\times 10^{-6}}{4 \\times 10^{-5}} \\,\\mathrm{s} = 0.625\\,\\mathrm{s}$.\nThe time at which $F(y)$ peaks is $y_{peak} = 2A/3 = 2(0.625)/3 \\approx 0.417\\,\\mathrm{s}$.\nThe heating period is $\\tau = 100\\,\\mathrm{s}$. For the time interval of interest, $t > \\tau$, we have $t > 100\\,\\mathrm{s}$ and $t-\\tau > 0$. Since $t > t-\\tau > y_{peak}$, both points are in the region where $F(y)$ is a strictly decreasing function.\nTherefore, for $t > \\tau$, we have $t > t-\\tau$, which implies $F(t) < F(t-\\tau)$. The term in brackets, $F(t-\\tau) - F(t)$, is positive.\nSince $(T_s - T_i) > 0$ and $\\sqrt{A/\\pi} > 0$, the sign of $\\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial t}$ is negative for all $t > \\tau$.\nThis proves that the temperature at depth $x^*$ is strictly decreasing for all $t > \\tau$.\n\nCombining our findings, $T(x^*,t)$ increases for $0 < t \\le \\tau$ and decreases for $t > \\tau$. Thus, the maximum temperature is achieved precisely at $t=\\tau$.\n$$\nT_{max} = T(x^*, \\tau) = T_i + (T_s - T_i) \\operatorname{erfc}\\left(\\frac{x^*}{\\sqrt{4\\alpha \\tau}}\\right)\n$$\nWe now substitute the given numerical values:\n$T_i = 20\\,^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$\n$T_s = 120\\,^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$\n$x^* = 5.0 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{m}$\n$\\alpha = 1.0 \\times 10^{-5}\\,\\mathrm{m^2/s}$\n$\\tau = 100\\,\\mathrm{s}$\n\nFirst, we compute the argument of the complementary error function:\n$$\nz = \\frac{x^*}{\\sqrt{4\\alpha \\tau}} = \\frac{5.0 \\times 10^{-3}}{\\sqrt{4 \\times (1.0 \\times 10^{-5}) \\times 100}} = \\frac{5.0 \\times 10^{-3}}{\\sqrt{4 \\times 10^{-3}}} = \\frac{5.0 \\times 10^{-3}}{\\sqrt{0.004}} \\approx 0.0790569\n$$\nWe evaluate the complementary error function for this argument:\n$$\n\\operatorname{erfc}(0.0790569) \\approx 0.9111565\n$$\nFinally, we calculate the maximum temperature:\n$$\nT_{max} = 20 + (120 - 20) \\times 0.9111565 = 20 + 100 \\times 0.9111565 = 20 + 91.11565 = 111.11565\\,^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}\n$$\nRounding the final answer to four significant figures gives $111.1\\,^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{111.1}\n$$", "id": "2534215"}]}
