The fin is made of a homogeneous, isotropic material with thermal conductivity $k$ that is independent of temperature. Heat is removed from the fin by convection on its lateral surface with a uniform convective heat transfer coefficient $h$ to the same ambient temperature $T_{\\infty}$. The tip at $x=L$ exchanges heat with the ambient by convection over the end area $A_{t}=A$ with a (possibly different) uniform coefficient $h_{t}$. Radiation is negligible.

Consider a segment of the fin of infinitesimal length $dx$ located at an axial position $x$. At steady state, the rate of energy conducted into the control volume at $x$ must balance the rate of energy conducted out at $x+dx$ and the rate of energy convected from the lateral surface of the control volume.\n\nLet $q_x(x)$ be the axial conduction heat rate at position $x$. The energy balance is:\n$$q_x(x) - q_x(x+dx) - dq_{\\text{conv}} = 0$$\nwhere $dq_{\\text{conv}}$ is the rate of heat transfer by convection from the surface of the differential element.

The general solution to the second-order ODE $\\frac{d^2\\theta}{dx^2} - m^2\\theta = 0$ is a linear combination of exponential or hyperbolic functions. The hyperbolic form is often more convenient for boundary conditions specified at two different points. A particularly useful form for a condition at $x=L$ is:\n$$\\theta(x) = C_1 \\cosh(m(L-x)) + C_2 \\sinh(m(L-x))$$\nThe derivative is $\\frac{d\\theta}{dx} = -mC_1 \\sinh(m(L-x)) - mC_2 \\cosh(m(L-x))$.\nApplying the tip boundary condition at $x=L$:\n$\\theta(L) = C_1$\n$\\frac{d\\theta}{dx}\\big|_{x=L} = -mC_2$\nSubstituting into the boundary condition equation:\n$-k(-mC_2) = h_t(C_1) \\implies kmC_2 = h_tC_1 \\implies C_2 = \\frac{h_t}{km}C_1$.\nLet $H = \\frac{h_t}{km}$ be a dimensionless heat transfer parameter for the tip.

Therefore, $H = \\frac{h_t}{km} \\ge 0$.\n-   For $x \\in [0,L]$, the argument of the hyperbolic functions $z = m(L-x)$ is non-negative ($z \\ge 0$).\n-   For $z \\ge 0$, $\\sinh(z) \\ge 0$ and $\\cosh(z) > 0$.\n-   The denominator, $\\cosh(mL) + H\\sinh(mL)$, is a sum of positive terms and is therefore always positive.\n-   The term in the numerator, $\\sinh(m(L-x)) + H\\cosh(m(L-x))$, is also a sum of non-negative terms. It is strictly positive for all $x \\in [0,L)$ and can be zero only if $x=L$ and simultaneously $H=0$ (corresponding to an adiabatic tip).\n-   The entire expression for $\\frac{d\\theta}{dx}$ is the product of a negative constant ($-m\\theta_b$) and a fraction that is non-negative.\nTherefore, for all $x \\in [0,L]$, we have $\\frac{d\\theta}{dx} \\le 0$. The derivative is strictly negative for $x<L$. This means that $\\theta(x)$ is a monotonically decreasing function of $x$ over the interval $[0,L]$.\n\nThe maximum value of a monotonically decreasing function on a closed interval $[0,L]$ must occur at the leftmost point of the interval, which is $x=0$.\nThus, the excess temperature $\\theta(x)$ is maximized at $x_{\\star}=0$.\nConsequently, the local lineal heat removal $q_f(x)$ is also maximized at $x_{\\star}=0$.\nThe problem requires the dimensionless location $x_{\\star}/L$.\n$$\\frac{x_{\\star}}{L} = \\frac{0}{L} = 0$$\nThis result is physically intuitive. The fin's only source of thermal energy is the hot wall at its base ($x=0$). As one moves along the fin, heat is continuously lost to the cooler surroundings. Therefore, the temperature must be highest at the base and must decrease along the fin's length. The local rate of convective heat loss, being directly proportional to the local temperature difference with the ambient, must also be greatest at the base where this temperature difference is maximal.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0}$$", "id": "2483877"}, {"introduction": "After learning to calculate the heat transfer from a fin, a critical engineering question is whether the fin is truly effective.

The purpose of a fin is to augment heat transfer by increasing the surface area available for convection. However, the fin itself possesses a finite thermal conductivity, introducing a thermal resistance to heat flow along its length. This causes the fin's surface temperature to decrease with distance from the base.\nThe overall performance of the fin depends on the trade-off between two competing effects:\n1. The increase in convective surface area (from $A_c$ to $PL$ for a fin of length $L$, neglecting the tip area).\n2. The decrease in the average surface temperature for convection, relative to the base temperature $T_b$, due to internal conductive resistance.\nIf a fin is constructed from a material with low thermal conductivity ($k$), or has a geometry with a small perimeter-to-area ratio ($P/A_c$, a \"thick\" fin), the internal conductive resistance can be substantial. In such a scenario, the fin material effectively insulates the base area it covers. The heat that would have been dissipated by convection from the bare base area $A_c$ is now forced to conduct through the fin, a path of potentially higher thermal resistance. If the reduction in average surface temperature is so severe that it outweighs the benefit of the added surface area, the total heat transfer from the finned surface will be less than that from the original bare surface.

The boundary condition becomes:\n$$\n\\frac{d\\theta}{dx}\\bigg|_{x=L} = -m Bi_t \\theta(L)\n$$\nApplying this to our general solution form:\n$$\nm\\theta_b \\sinh(mL) + mC_{2,\\mathrm{conv}} \\cosh(mL) = -m Bi_t (\\theta_b \\cosh(mL) + C_{2,\\mathrm{conv}} \\sinh(mL))\n$$\nThe factor $m$ cancels out:\n$$\n\\theta_b \\sinh(mL) + C_{2,\\mathrm{conv}} \\cosh(mL) = -Bi_t \\theta_b \\cosh(mL) - Bi_t C_{2,\\mathrm{conv}} \\sinh(mL)\n$$\nSolving for $C_{2,\\mathrm{conv}}$:\n$$\nC_{2,\\mathrm{conv}}(\\cosh(mL) + Bi_t \\sinh(mL)) = -\\theta_b(\\sinh(mL) + Bi_t \\cosh(mL))\n$$\n$$\nC_{2,\\mathrm{conv}} = -\\theta_b \\frac{\\sinh(mL) + Bi_t \\cosh(mL)}{\\cosh(mL) + Bi_t \\sinh(mL)}\n$$\nThe base heat rate for the convective tip case is:\n$$\nQ_{b,\\mathrm{conv}} = -kAmC_{2,\\mathrm{conv}} = kAm\\theta_b \\left( \\frac{\\sinh(mL) + Bi_t \\cosh(mL)}{\\cosh(mL) + Bi_t \\sinh(mL)} \\right)\n$$\n\n(i) Derivation of the relative error $\\varepsilon$\nThe relative error is $\\varepsilon = \\dfrac{|Q_{b,\\mathrm{adi}} - Q_{b,\\mathrm{conv}}|}{Q_{b,\\mathrm{conv}}}$. Since a fin with a convective tip always dissipates more heat than one with an adiabatic tip (for $h>0$), we have $Q_{b,\\mathrm{conv}} \\geq Q_{b,\\mathrm{adi}}$. Thus, the absolute value can be written as $Q_{b,\\mathrm{conv}} - Q_{b,\\mathrm{adi}}$.\n$$\n\\varepsilon = \\frac{Q_{b,\\mathrm{conv}} - Q_{b,\\mathrm{adi}}}{Q_{b,\\mathrm{conv}}} = 1 - \\frac{Q_{b,\\mathrm{adi}}}{Q_{b,\\mathrm{conv}}}\n$$\nThe ratio of the heat rates is:\n$$\n\\frac{Q_{b,\\mathrm{adi}}}{Q_{b,\\mathrm{conv}}} = \\frac{kAm\\theta_b \\tanh(mL)}{kAm\\theta_b \\left( \\frac{\\sinh(mL) + Bi_t \\cosh(mL)}{\\cosh(mL) + Bi_t \\sinh(mL)} \\right)} = \\frac{\\sinh(mL)}{\\cosh(mL)} \\frac{\\cosh(mL) + Bi_t \\sinh(mL)}{\\sinh(mL) + Bi_t \\cosh(mL)}\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{Q_{b,\\mathrm{adi}}}{Q_{b,\\mathrm{conv}}} = \\frac{\\sinh(mL)\\cosh(mL) + Bi_t \\sinh^2(mL)}{\\sinh(mL)\\cosh(mL) + Bi_t \\cosh^2(mL)}\n$$\nSubstituting this into the expression for $\\varepsilon$:\n$$\n\\varepsilon = 1 - \\frac{\\sinh(mL)\\cosh(mL) + Bi_t \\sinh^2(mL)}{\\sinh(mL)\\cosh(mL) + Bi_t \\cosh^2(mL)}\n$$\n$$\n\\varepsilon = \\frac{(\\sinh(mL)\\cosh(mL) + Bi_t \\cosh^2(mL)) - (\\sinh(mL)\\cosh(mL) + Bi_t \\sinh^2(mL))}{\\sinh(mL)\\cosh(mL) + Bi_t \\cosh^2(mL)}\n$$\nUsing the identity $\\cosh^2(z) - \\sinh^2(z) = 1$:\n$$\n\\varepsilon(mL, Bi_t) = \\frac{Bi_t (\\cosh^2(mL) - \\sinh^2(mL))}{\\sinh(mL)\\cosh(mL) + Bi_t \\cosh^2(mL)} = \\frac{Bi_t}{\\sinh(mL)\\cosh(mL) + Bi_t \\cosh^2(mL)}\n$$\nThis is the exact expression for the relative error as a function of $mL$ and $Bi_t$.\n\n(ii) Determination of the largest allowable $Bi_t$\nWe are asked to find the largest $Bi_t$ such that $\\varepsilon < 0.05$ for all $mL \\geq 1$. This requires finding the \"worst-case\" scenario, which corresponds to the maximum value of $\\varepsilon$ in the specified domain of $mL$. Let $u = mL$. The function to analyze is:\n$$\n\\varepsilon(u, Bi_t) = \\frac{Bi_t}{\\sinh(u)\\cosh(u) + Bi_t \\cosh^2(u)}\n$$\nTo find the maximum, we examine the derivative of $\\varepsilon$ with respect to $u$. It is easier to analyze the denominator, $D(u) = \\sinh(u)\\cosh(u) + Bi_t \\cosh^2(u)$.\n$$\n\\frac{dD}{du} = [\\cosh^2(u) + \\sinh^2(u)] + Bi_t [2\\cosh(u)\\sinh(u)]\n$$\nFor $u \\geq 1$ and $Bi_t > 0$ (physical requirement), all terms in the derivative are positive ($\\cosh(u)>0, \\sinh(u)>0$). Therefore, $\\frac{dD}{du} > 0$. Since the denominator $D(u)$ is a monotonically increasing function of $u$, and the numerator $Bi_t$ is constant with respect to $u$, the function $\\varepsilon(u, Bi_t)$ is a monotonically decreasing function of $u$ for $u>0$.\nConsequently, the maximum error in the domain $u = mL \\geq 1$ occurs at the lower bound, $u=mL=1$.\n$$\n\\varepsilon_{\\max} = \\varepsilon(1, Bi_t) = \\frac{Bi_t}{\\sinh(1)\\cosh(1) + Bi_t \\cosh^2(1)}\n$$\nWe require this maximum error to be less than $0.05$:\n$$\n\\frac{Bi_t}{\\sinh(1)\\cosh(1) + Bi_t \\cosh^2(1)} < 0.05\n$$\nSince the denominator is positive, we can write:\n$$\nBi_t < 0.05(\\sinh(1)\\cosh(1) + Bi_t \\cosh^2(1))\n$$\n$$\nBi_t < 0.05\\sinh(1)\\cosh(1) + 0.05 Bi_t \\cosh^2(1)\n$$\n$$\nBi_t (1 - 0.05 \\cosh^2(1)) < 0.05\\sinh(1)\\cosh(1)\n$$\nTo check the sign of the term multiplying $Bi_t$:\n$\\cosh(1) \\approx 1.543$, so $\\cosh^2(1) \\approx 2.381$. Then $1 - 0.05 \\times 2.381 = 1 - 0.119 = 0.881 > 0$. The inequality direction is preserved upon division.\nThe largest allowable value of $Bi_t$ is the supremum of the set of solutions, which is found at the equality:\n$$\nBi_t = \\frac{0.05\\sinh(1)\\cosh(1)}{1 - 0.05\\cosh^2(1)}\n$$\nWe can simplify this by dividing the numerator and denominator by $\\cosh^2(1)$:\n$$\nBi_t = \\frac{0.05\\tanh(1)}{1/\\cosh^2(1) - 0.05} = \\frac{0.05\\tanh(1)}{\\operatorname{sech}^2(1) - 0.05}\n$$\nNow, we compute the numerical value:\n$\\tanh(1) \\approx 0.761594$\n$\\cosh(1) \\approx 1.543081$\n$\\operatorname{sech}^2(1) = 1/\\cosh^2(1) \\approx 1/(1.543081)^2 \\approx 0.419974$\n$$\nBi_t = \\frac{0.05 \\times 0.761594}{0.419974 - 0.05} = \\frac{0.0380797}{0.369974} \\approx 0.1029252\n$$\nRounding to three significant figures, the largest allowable value for $Bi_t$ is $0.103$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.103}$$", "id": "2483933"}]}
