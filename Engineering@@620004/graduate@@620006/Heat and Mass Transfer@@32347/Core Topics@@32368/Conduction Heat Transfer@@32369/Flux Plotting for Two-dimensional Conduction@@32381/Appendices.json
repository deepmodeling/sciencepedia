It is a standard problem in the field of heat transfer, free of ambiguity or contradiction. It is therefore deemed valid and a formal solution can be constructed.\n\nFirst, we must formulate the governing differential equation from the fundamental principles. The steady-state energy balance for a control volume with no internal heat generation is expressed as $\\nabla \\cdot \\vec{q} = 0$, where $\\vec{q}$ is the heat flux vector. According to Fourier's law of heat conduction for an isotropic material, $\\vec{q} = -k \\nabla T$, where $k$ is the thermal conductivity and $T$ is the temperature. Combining these gives the general heat equation for this case: $\\nabla \\cdot (-k \\nabla T) = 0$.\n\nThe problem specifies a two-dimensional domain in Cartesian coordinates $(x,y)$, defined by $0 \\le x \\le L$ and $0 \\le y \\le H$. The thermal conductivity $k$ is constant. The equation thus simplifies to the two-dimensional Laplace's equation:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial^2 T}{\\partial x^2} + \\frac{\\partial^2 T}{\\partial y^2} = 0 $$\nThis is the governing partial differential equation for the temperature field $T(x,y)$.\n\nNext, we formulate the boundary conditions based on the problem statement:\n$1$. The boundary at $x=0$ is isothermal at $T_{\\mathrm{hot}}$: $T(0,y) = T_{\\mathrm{hot}}$.\n$2$. The boundary at $x=L$ is isothermal at $T_{\\mathrm{cold}}$: $T(L,y) = T_{\\mathrm{cold}}$.\n$3$. The boundary at $y=0$ is perfectly insulated (adiabatic). This means the heat flux component normal to this boundary is zero. The heat flux in the $y$-direction is $q_y = -k \\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial y}$. Thus, the boundary condition is $\\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial y}(x,0) = 0$.\n$4$. The boundary at $y=H$ is also adiabatic: $\\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial y}(x,H) = 0$.\n\nWe solve this boundary value problem using the method of separation of variables. We assume a solution of the form $T(x,y) = X(x)Y(y)$. Substituting this into Laplace's equation gives:\n$$ X''(x)Y(y) + X(x)Y''(y) = 0 $$\nDividing by $X(x)Y(y)$ separates the variables:\n$$ \\frac{X''(x)}{X(x)} = -\\frac{Y''(y)}{Y(y)} = \\lambda $$\nwhere $\\lambda$ is the separation constant. This yields two ordinary differential equations:\n$$ X''(x) - \\lambda X(x) = 0 $$\n$$ Y''(y) + \\lambda Y(y) = 0 $$\nThe homogeneous boundary conditions are in the $y$-direction. We apply them to the equation for $Y(y)$:\nFrom $\\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial y} = X(x)Y'(y)$, the boundary conditions become $Y'(0)=0$ and $Y'(H)=0$.\n\nWe analyze the possible values for $\\lambda$:\nCase $1$: $\\lambda = 0$. The equation becomes $Y''(y) = 0$, with general solution $Y(y) = C_1 y + C_2$. Applying the boundary conditions, $Y'(y) = C_1$, so $Y'(0) = C_1 = 0$. $Y'(H)=C_1=0$ is also satisfied. Thus, for $\\lambda=0$, we have a non-trivial solution $Y_0(y) = C_2$, which is a constant.\nCase $2$: $\\lambda > 0$. Let $\\lambda = \\mu^2$ for $\\mu > 0$. The equation is $Y''(y) + \\mu^2 Y(y) = 0$, with solution $Y(y) = C_3 \\cos(\\mu y) + C_4 \\sin(\\mu y)$. The derivative is $Y'(y) = -C_3 \\mu \\sin(\\mu y) + C_4 \\mu \\cos(\\mu y)$. From $Y'(0)=0$, we get $C_4 \\mu = 0$, which implies $C_4=0$. The solution is now $Y(y) = C_3 \\cos(\\mu y)$. From $Y'(H)=0$, we get $-C_3 \\mu \\sin(\\mu H) = 0$. For a non-trivial solution ($C_3 \\neq 0$), we must have $\\sin(\\mu H) = 0$, which means $\\mu H = n\\pi$ for $n=1, 2, 3, \\ldots$. The eigenvalues are $\\lambda_n = \\mu_n^2 = (\\frac{n\\pi}{H})^2$, with corresponding eigenfunctions $Y_n(y) = \\cos(\\frac{n\\pi y}{H})$ for $n=1, 2, 3, \\ldots$.\nCase $3$: $\\lambda < 0$. Let $\\lambda = -\\mu^2$ for $\\mu > 0$. The equation is $Y''(y) - \\mu^2 Y(y) = 0$, with solution $Y(y) = C_5 \\cosh(\\mu y) + C_6 \\sinh(\\mu y)$. The derivative is $Y'(y) = C_5 \\mu \\sinh(\\mu y) + C_6 \\mu \\cosh(\\mu y)$. From $Y'(0)=0$, we get $C_6 \\mu = 0$, so $C_6=0$. The solution becomes $Y(y) = C_5 \\cosh(\\mu y)$. From $Y'(H)=0$, we have $C_5 \\mu \\sinh(\\mu H) = 0$. Since $\\mu > 0$ and $H > 0$, $\\sinh(\\mu H) \\neq 0$, so we must have $C_5=0$. This case yields only the trivial solution.\n\nNow we solve the equation for $X(x)$ for the allowed eigenvalues.\nFor $\\lambda_0 = 0$: $X_0''(x) = 0$, which has the solution $X_0(x) = A_0 x + B_0$.\nFor $\\lambda_n = (\\frac{n\\pi}{H})^2$: $X_n''(x) - (\\frac{n\\pi}{H})^2 X_n(x) = 0$. The solution is $X_n(x) = A_n \\cosh(\\frac{n\\pi x}{H}) + B_n \\sinh(\\frac{n\\pi x}{H})$.\n\nThe general solution for $T(x,y)$ is a superposition of all product solutions:\n$$ T(x,y) = (A_0 x + B_0) + \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\left( A_n \\cosh\\left(\\frac{n\\pi x}{H}\\right) + B_n \\sinh\\left(\\frac{n\\pi x}{H}\\right) \\right) \\cos\\left(\\frac{n\\pi y}{H}\\right) $$\nWe apply the remaining isothermal boundary conditions at $x=0$ and $x=L$.\nAt $x=0$, $T(0,y) = T_{\\mathrm{hot}}$:\n$$ T_{\\mathrm{hot}} = B_0 + \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} A_n \\cos\\left(\\frac{n\\pi y}{H}\\right) $$\nThis is a Fourier cosine series for the constant function $f(y) = T_{\\mathrm{hot}}$. The coefficients are found by orthogonality.\nThe constant term is $B_0 = \\frac{1}{H}\\int_0^H T_{\\mathrm{hot}} dy = T_{\\mathrm{hot}}$.\nThe other coefficients are $A_n = \\frac{2}{H}\\int_0^H T_{\\mathrm{hot}} \\cos(\\frac{n\\pi y}{H}) dy = \\frac{2T_{\\mathrm{hot}}}{H} \\left[\\frac{H}{n\\pi}\\sin\\left(\\frac{n\\pi y}{H}\\right)\\right]_0^H = 0$ for $n \\ge 1$.\nThus, all coefficients $A_n$ for $n \\ge 1$ are zero.\n\nThe solution simplifies to:\n$$ T(x,y) = (A_0 x + T_{\\mathrm{hot}}) + \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} B_n \\sinh\\left(\\frac{n\\pi x}{H}\\right) \\cos\\left(\\frac{n\\pi y}{H}\\right) $$\nNow, at $x=L$, $T(L,y) = T_{\\mathrm{cold}}$:\n$$ T_{\\mathrm{cold}} = (A_0 L + T_{\\mathrm{hot}}) + \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} B_n \\sinh\\left(\\frac{n\\pi L}{H}\\right) \\cos\\left(\\frac{n\\pi y}{H}\\right) $$\nThis is another Fourier cosine series for the constant function $g(y) = T_{\\mathrm{cold}}$.\nThe constant term is $A_0 L + T_{\\mathrm{hot}} = \\frac{1}{H}\\int_0^H T_{\\mathrm{cold}} dy = T_{\\mathrm{cold}}$. From this, we find $A_0 = \\frac{T_{\\mathrm{cold}} - T_{\\mathrm{hot}}}{L}$.\nThe other coefficients are $B_n \\sinh(\\frac{n\\pi L}{H}) = \\frac{2}{H}\\int_0^H T_{\\mathrm{cold}} \\cos(\\frac{n\\pi y}{H}) dy = 0$ for $n \\ge 1$.\nSince $\\sinh(\\frac{n\\pi L}{H}) \\neq 0$ for $n \\ge 1$, we must have $B_n=0$ for all $n \\ge 1$.\n\nAll coefficients of the infinite series are zero. The solution is solely determined by the $\\lambda=0$ case:\n$$ T(x,y) = A_0 x + B_0 = \\left(\\frac{T_{\\mathrm{cold}} - T_{\\mathrm{hot}}}{L}\\right)x + T_{\\mathrm{hot}} $$\nThis shows that the temperature depends only on $x$, a result of the adiabatic side boundaries.\n\nThe isotherms are surfaces of constant temperature, $T(x,y) = T_{\\mathrm{const}}$. This implies $x = \\frac{T_{\\mathrm{const}} - T_{\\mathrm{hot}}}{T_{\\mathrm{cold}} - T_{\\mathrm{hot}}} L = \\text{constant}$. The isotherms are vertical lines parallel to the $y$-axis.\n\nThe heat flux vector is $\\vec{q} = -k \\nabla T$. The temperature gradient is $\\nabla T = \\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial x}\\hat{i} + \\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial y}\\hat{j}$.\nIn our case, $\\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial x} = \\frac{T_{\\mathrm{cold}} - T_{\\mathrm{hot}}}{L}$ and $\\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial y} = 0$.\nSo, $\\vec{q} = -k \\left(\\frac{T_{\\mathrm{cold}} - T_{\\mathrm{hot}}}{L}\\right)\\hat{i} = k\\left(\\frac{T_{\\mathrm{hot}} - T_{\\mathrm{cold}}}{L}\\right)\\hat{i}$.\nThe heat-flux lines point purely in the positive $x$-direction (from hot to cold) and are therefore horizontal lines. Horizontal heat-flux lines are orthogonal to the vertical isotherms, which is consistent with the fundamental principle that heat flows normal to lines of constant temperature. A flux plot would correctly show vertical isotherms and horizontal heat-flux lines.\n\nFinally, we must evaluate the magnitude of the heat flux vector, $|\\vec{q}|$, at any interior point. Since $\\vec{q}$ is constant throughout the domain:\n$$ |\\vec{q}| = \\left| k\\left(\\frac{T_{\\mathrm{hot}} - T_{\\mathrm{cold}}}{L}\\right) \\right| $$\nGiven that $k > 0$, $L > 0$, and $T_{\\mathrm{hot}} > T_{\\mathrm{cold}}$, this simplifies to:\n$$ |\\vec{q}| = k\\frac{T_{\\mathrm{hot}} - T_{\\mathrm{cold}}}{L} $$\nIt is notable that the magnitude is independent of both $x$ and $y$, and also independent of the plate height $H$.\nSubstituting the given numerical values:\n$k = 15\\,\\mathrm{W\\,m^{-1}\\,K^{-1}}$, $L = 0.50\\,\\mathrm{m}$, $T_{\\mathrm{hot}} = 400\\,\\mathrm{K}$, and $T_{\\mathrm{cold}} = 300\\,\\mathrm{K}$.\n$$ |\\vec{q}| = (15) \\frac{400 - 300}{0.50} = 15 \\frac{100}{0.50} = 15 \\times 200 = 3000\\,\\mathrm{W\\,m^{-2}} $$\nRounding to three significant figures, the result is $3.00 \\times 10^3\\,\\mathrm{W\\,m^{-2}}$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{3.00 \\times 10^{3}}$$", "id": "2487924"}, {"introduction": "Having established a baseline with a simple geometry, we now tackle a more complex case to validate the quantitative power of flux plotting.

A rigorous solution can be constructed.\n\nThe problem requires an analysis of steady two-dimensional heat conduction in a domain where the boundaries are non-concentric circles. The governing equation for the temperature field $T$ with no heat generation is the Laplace equation, $\\nabla^2 T = 0$.\n\nFirst, we identify the appropriate coordinate system. The boundaries are described as circles of radius $1/\\sinh(\\mu)$ centered at $(\\coth(\\mu), 0)$. This is the characteristic form of level surfaces of the coordinate $\\mu$ in a bipolar coordinate system $(\\mu, \\eta)$. The transformation from Cartesian coordinates $(x, y)$ to bipolar coordinates is given by\n$$ x = \\frac{a \\sinh(\\mu)}{\\cosh(\\mu) - \\cos(\\eta)}, \\quad y = \\frac{a \\sin(\\eta)}{\\cosh(\\mu) - \\cos(\\eta)} $$\nwhere $a$ is a scaling constant. A surface of constant $\\mu$ is a circle described by the equation $(x - a \\coth(\\mu))^2 + y^2 = (a/\\sinh(\\mu))^2$. Comparing this with the problem statement, we identify the scaling constant as $a=1$ m. The outer boundary, held at temperature $T_{\\mathrm{h}}$, corresponds to the coordinate surface $\\mu_h = 1$. The inner boundary, held at temperature $T_{\\mathrm{c}}$, corresponds to the coordinate surface $\\mu_c = 2$. The domain of interest is therefore $1 \\le \\mu \\le 2$ and $0 \\le \\eta < 2\\pi$.\n\nThe Laplace equation in a general two-dimensional orthogonal coordinate system $(u_1, u_2)$ with scale factors $h_1$ and $h_2$ is\n$$ \\nabla^2 T = \\frac{1}{h_1 h_2} \\left[ \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial u_1}\\left(\\frac{h_2}{h_1}\\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial u_1}\\right) + \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial u_2}\\left(\\frac{h_1}{h_2}\\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial u_2}\\right) \\right] = 0 $$\nFor bipolar coordinates with $a=1$, the scale factors are identical: $h_\\mu = h_\\eta = h = (\\cosh(\\mu) - \\cos(\\eta))^{-1}$. The Laplace equation simplifies significantly to\n$$ \\frac{1}{h^2} \\left( \\frac{\\partial^2 T}{\\partial \\mu^2} + \\frac{\\partial^2 T}{\\partial \\eta^2} \\right) = 0 \\quad \\implies \\quad \\frac{\\partial^2 T}{\\partial \\mu^2} + \\frac{\\partial^2 T}{\\partial \\eta^2} = 0 $$\nThe boundary conditions are $T(\\mu=1, \\eta) = T_{\\mathrm{h}}$ and $T(\\mu=2, \\eta) = T_{\\mathrm{c}}$. As these temperatures are uniform and do not depend on the coordinate $\\eta$, it is logical to assume the temperature field is only a function of $\\mu$, so $T = T(\\mu)$. The governing equation reduces to an ordinary differential equation:\n$$ \\frac{d^2 T}{d\\mu^2} = 0 $$\nThe general solution is a linear function of $\\mu$: $T(\\mu) = C_1 \\mu + C_2$. The constants $C_1$ and $C_2$ are determined from the boundary conditions:\n$T(\\mu_h) = T(1) = C_1(1) + C_2 = T_{\\mathrm{h}}$\n$T(\\mu_c) = T(2) = C_1(2) + C_2 = T_{\\mathrm{c}}$\nSubtracting the first equation from the second gives $C_1 = T_{\\mathrm{c}} - T_{\\mathrm{h}}$. Substituting $C_1$ into the first equation gives $C_2 = T_{\\mathrm{h}} - C_1 = T_{\\mathrm{h}} - (T_{\\mathrm{c}} - T_{\\mathrm{h}}) = 2T_{\\mathrm{h}} - T_{\\mathrm{c}}$.\nThe temperature distribution is thus $T(\\mu) = (T_{\\mathrm{c}} - T_{\\mathrm{h}})\\mu + (2T_{\\mathrm{h}} - T_{\\mathrm{c}})$.\n\nTo find the total heat transfer per unit thickness, $Q'$, we apply Fourier's law of heat conduction, $\\vec{q} = -k \\nabla T$. In bipolar coordinates, the gradient is $\\nabla T = \\frac{1}{h_\\mu} \\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial \\mu} \\hat{e}_\\mu + \\frac{1}{h_\\eta} \\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial \\eta} \\hat{e}_\\eta$. Since $T=T(\\mu)$, $\\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial \\eta}=0$. The heat flux vector is purely in the $\\mu$ direction:\n$$ \\vec{q} = -k \\frac{1}{h_\\mu} \\frac{dT}{d\\mu} \\hat{e}_\\mu = -k (\\cosh(\\mu) - \\cos(\\eta)) C_1 \\hat{e}_\\mu $$\nThe total heat transfer $Q'$ from the hot boundary to the cold one is found by integrating the normal component of the heat flux over any isotherm. We choose an arbitrary isotherm $\\mu = \\text{constant}$. The differential length element along this isotherm is $dL = h_\\eta d\\eta$. The heat transfer rate is integrated over the full range of $\\eta$ from $0$ to $2\\pi$:\n$$ Q' = \\int_{0}^{2\\pi} (\\vec{q} \\cdot \\hat{e}_\\mu) \\, dL = \\int_{0}^{2\\pi} \\left[ -k \\frac{1}{h_\\mu} \\frac{dT}{d\\mu} \\right] h_\\eta \\, d\\eta $$\nSince $h_\\mu = h_\\eta$, these terms cancel. The integrand becomes independent of the integration variable $\\eta$:\n$$ Q' = \\int_{0}^{2\\pi} \\left( -k \\frac{dT}{d\\mu} \\right) d\\eta = -2\\pi k \\frac{dT}{d\\mu} = -2\\pi k C_1 $$\nSubstituting $C_1 = T_{\\mathrm{c}} - T_{\\mathrm{h}}$:\n$$ Q' = -2\\pi k (T_{\\mathrm{c}} - T_{\\mathrm{h}}) = 2\\pi k (T_{\\mathrm{h}} - T_{\\mathrm{c}}) $$\nIn terms of the given coordinate values $\\mu_h=1$ and $\\mu_c=2$, the general solution for $C_1$ is $C_1 = \\frac{T_c - T_h}{\\mu_c - \\mu_h}$. The general expression for heat transfer is thus:\n$$ Q' = \\frac{2\\pi k (T_{\\mathrm{h}} - T_{\\mathrm{c}})}{\\mu_c - \\mu_h} = \\frac{2\\pi k \\Delta T}{\\mu_c - \\mu_h} $$\nFor the specific values $\\mu_h=1$ and $\\mu_c=2$, the denominator $\\mu_c - \\mu_h = 1$, giving $Q' = 2\\pi k \\Delta T$.\n\nNext, we consider the flux-plotting method. This method estimates heat transfer using the formula $Q' = k S \\Delta T$, where $S$ is the conduction shape factor, given by the ratio of the number of flow channels, $N_f$, to the number of potential steps, $N_p$. The method relies on constructing a mesh of isotherms and orthogonal adiabats (streamlines) that form curvilinear squares.\nIn our problem, the coordinate system itself provides this mesh. The isotherms are lines of constant $\\mu$, and the streamlines are lines of constant $\\eta$. A small cell in this coordinate grid has physical dimensions $\\Delta n = h_\\mu \\Delta \\mu$ and $\\Delta s = h_\\eta \\Delta \\eta$. For this cell to be a curvilinear square, we must have $\\Delta n \\approx \\Delta s$. Since $h_\\mu=h_\\eta$ in bipolar coordinates, this condition implies we must choose our coordinate increments to be equal: $\\Delta\\mu = \\Delta\\eta$.\nThe total number of potential steps, $N_p$, is the total span of the potential coordinate, $\\mu_c - \\mu_h$, divided by the increment $\\Delta\\mu$: $N_p = (\\mu_c - \\mu_h)/\\Delta\\mu$.\nThe total number of flow channels, $N_f$, spans the full geometry. For a complete annular region, the coordinate $\\eta$ ranges from $0$ to $2\\pi$. So, $N_f = (2\\pi)/\\Delta\\eta$.\nThe shape factor $S$ is the ratio:\n$$ S = \\frac{N_f}{N_p} = \\frac{2\\pi/\\Delta\\eta}{(\\mu_c - \\mu_h)/\\Delta\\mu} $$\nSince we chose $\\Delta\\mu = \\Delta\\eta$, this simplifies to:\n$$ S = \\frac{2\\pi}{\\mu_c - \\mu_h} $$\nThe heat transfer estimate from flux plotting is $Q'_{flux} = k S \\Delta T = \\frac{2\\pi k \\Delta T}{\\mu_c - \\mu_h}$.\n\nComparing the two results, the analytical expression for $Q'$ is identical to the expression derived from the flux-plotting methodology. The flux plot, in this case, is not an approximation but an exact representation. This is because the bipolar coordinate transformation is a conformal map, which by definition preserves angles and maps an orthogonal grid in the $(\\mu, \\eta)$ plane to an orthogonal grid in the $(x, y)$ plane. The concept of curvilinear squares with equal coordinate increments becomes exact.\n\nFinally, we compute the numerical value of $Q'$.

You intend to construct a hand flux plot (orthogonal net of isotherms and heat-flow lines) to estimate the total heat rate $Q$ entering through the left boundary.\n\nWhich option best justifies the practice of locally refining the flux plot near the transition point $(x,y)=(a,0)$ and correctly explains how such local refinement can affect the global estimate of $Q$? Choose one.\n\nA. Near a smooth boundary point where a Dirichlet condition meets a Neumann condition, the solution of the governing Laplace equation exhibits a local asymptotic form $T\\sim T_{\\star}+C\\,r^{1/2}\\Phi(\\theta)$ in polar coordinates $(r,\\theta)$ centered at the transition, implying $|\\nabla T|\\sim r^{-1/2}$. A coarse flux plot cannot resolve the rapid crowding of isotherms and heat-flow lines implied by $r^{-1/2}$, which breaks the equal-flux channeling implicit in an orthogonal net. Because the total heat rate $Q$ is a line integral of the normal heat flux density along the boundary, the regions with large $|\\nabla T|$ disproportionately influence $Q$’s estimate; hence local refinement near $(a,0)$ yields a substantial reduction of the dominant error in the global heat-rate estimate.\n\nB. By conservation of energy, any local discretization errors near $(a,0)$ must cancel in the integral for $Q$, so once the net is reasonably resolved away from the transition, refining only a small neighborhood cannot change the estimated global heat rate.\n\nC. Refinement near singularities serves primarily to make the net appear smoother; mathematically, orthogonality away from the point $(a,0)$ suffices for an accurate global heat-rate estimate, and additional detail near the transition does not alter the result.\n\nD. The heat flux density diverges so strongly at a Dirichlet–Neumann junction that the total heat rate $Q$ becomes infinite; local refinement merely pushes the divergence to smaller scales and does not improve the accuracy of any finite estimate of $Q$.", "solution": "The user-provided problem statement shall first be validated for scientific and logical soundness.\n\n**Step 1: Extract Givens**\n- **Domain**: A homogeneous, isotropic plate with thermal conductivity $k$.\n- **Geometry**: A rectangle defined by $\\{(x,y): 0<x<L,\\;0<y<H\\}$.\n- **Physics**: Steady-state conduction, governed by conservation of energy with no internal generation, and Fourier's law.

The governing equation for a homogeneous material with no heat generation is the Laplace equation, $\\nabla^2 T = 0$. The boundary conditions are of Dirichlet and Neumann type, which are standard in such problems. The central feature is the point $(a,0)$ where the boundary condition type changes abruptly.

The problem is scientifically sound.\n- **Well-Posedness**: This configuration represents a mixed boundary value problem for the Laplace equation. Such problems are known to have a unique and stable solution. The junction of a Dirichlet and a Neumann condition on a straight boundary introduces a local singularity in the derivatives of the solution (i.e., the temperature gradient), but not in the temperature field itself.

It is a well-formulated question in the field of heat transfer that probes a key concept in both analytical and numerical solutions of PDEs. The derivation of the solution and evaluation of options can proceed.\n\n**Derivation**\n\nThe temperature distribution $T(x,y)$ within the plate is governed by the two-dimensional Laplace equation:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial^2 T}{\\partial x^2} + \\frac{\\partial^2 T}{\\partial y^2} = 0\n$$\nA flux plot is a graphical solution to this equation, consisting of two families of curves: isotherms ($T=\\text{constant}$) and heat flow lines (also called adiabats). By Fourier's law, the heat flux vector is $\\vec{q} = -k \\nabla T$. Since the gradient vector $\\nabla T$ is perpendicular to level sets of $T$, the heat flow lines are everywhere orthogonal to the isotherms.\n\nThe core of the problem lies in the behavior of the solution near the point $(a,0)$, where the boundary condition on $y=0$ switches from Dirichlet ($T=T_{\\mathrm{C}}$ for $x<a$) to Neumann ($\\partial T/\\partial y = 0$ for $x>a$).\n\nTo analyze the local field, we introduce a polar coordinate system $(r,\\theta)$ centered at $(a,0)$, such that $x-a = r\\cos\\theta$ and $y=r\\sin\\theta$. The domain of the plate is locally in the upper half-plane, $0 \\le \\theta \\le \\pi$.\n- The boundary $y=0, x<a$ corresponds to $\\theta=\\pi$. The condition is $T=T_{\\mathrm{C}}$.\n- The boundary $y=0, x>a$ corresponds to $\\theta=0$. The condition is $\\partial T/\\partial y = 0$. In polar coordinates, this Neumann condition becomes $\\frac{1}{r}\\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial \\theta}|_{\\theta=0}=0$.\n\nIn polar coordinates, Laplace's equation is:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial^2 T}{\\partial r^2} + \\frac{1}{r}\\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial r} + \\frac{1}{r^2}\\frac{\\partial^2 T}{\\partial \\theta^2} = 0\n$$\nWe seek a separated solution of the form $T(r,\\theta) - T_{\\mathrm{C}} = R(r)\\Theta(\\theta)$. Substituting into the PDE leads to solutions for $R(r)$ of the form $r^\\lambda$ and an ODE for $\\Theta(\\theta)$:\n$$\n\\frac{d^2\\Theta}{d\\theta^2} + \\lambda^2 \\Theta = 0\n$$\nThe general solution is $\\Theta(\\theta) = C_1 \\cos(\\lambda\\theta) + C_2 \\sin(\\lambda\\theta)$. Applying the local boundary conditions:\n1.  At $\\theta = 0$, $\\partial T/\\partial \\theta=0 \\implies d\\Theta/d\\theta = 0$.\n    $[-C_1 \\lambda \\sin(0) + C_2 \\lambda \\cos(0)] = 0 \\implies C_2 \\lambda = 0$. For a non-trivial solution, we require $C_2=0$.\n2.  With $C_2=0$, the solution becomes $\\Theta(\\theta) = C_1 \\cos(\\lambda\\theta)$.\n3.  At $\\theta = \\pi$, $T=T_{\\mathrm{C}} \\implies T-T_{\\mathrm{C}}=0 \\implies \\Theta(\\pi)=0$.\n    $C_1 \\cos(\\lambda\\pi) = 0$. For a non-trivial solution ($C_1 \\ne 0$), we must have $\\cos(\\lambda\\pi)=0$.\n4.  This implies $\\lambda\\pi = (n + 1/2)\\pi$ for any integer $n \\ge 0$. The eigenvalues are $\\lambda_n = n + 1/2$.\n\nThe local solution is a linear combination of terms of the form $C_n r^{\\lambda_n}\\cos(\\lambda_n\\theta)$. For small $r$ (i.e., very close to the point $(a,0)$), the solution is dominated by the term with the smallest positive exponent $\\lambda$. This corresponds to $n=0$, giving $\\lambda_0=1/2$.\nThus, the asymptotic form of the temperature field near $(a,0)$ is:\n$$\nT(r,\\theta) \\approx T_{\\mathrm{C}} + C r^{1/2} \\cos(\\theta/2)\n$$\nwhere $C$ is a constant. Now, we compute the temperature gradient, $\\nabla T$:\n$$\n\\nabla T = \\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial r}\\hat{e}_r + \\frac{1}{r}\\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial \\theta}\\hat{e}_\\theta \\approx C\\left(\\frac{1}{2}r^{-1/2}\\cos(\\theta/2)\\right)\\hat{e}_r + \\frac{1}{r}C\\left(r^{1/2}\\left(-\\frac{1}{2}\\sin(\\theta/2)\\right)\\right)\\hat{e}_\\theta\n$$\n$$\n\\nabla T \\approx \\frac{C}{2}r^{-1/2}\\cos(\\theta/2)\\,\\hat{e}_r - \\frac{C}{2}r^{-1/2}\\sin(\\theta/2)\\,\\hat{e}_\\theta\n$$\nThe magnitude of the gradient is:\n$$\n|\\nabla T| = \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{C}{2}r^{-1/2}\\cos(\\theta/2)\\right)^2 + \\left(-\\frac{C}{2}r^{-1/2}\\sin(\\theta/2)\\right)^2} = \\frac{|C|}{2}r^{-1/2}\\sqrt{\\cos^2(\\theta/2)+\\sin^2(\\theta/2)} = \\frac{|C|}{2}r^{-1/2}\n$$\nThe heat flux density $|\\vec{q}| = k|\\nabla T|$ therefore diverges as $r^{-1/2}$ as $r \\to 0$.\n\nThis result has direct implications for flux plotting. The density of both isotherms and heat flow lines is proportional to $|\\nabla T|$. An $r^{-1/2}$ divergence means that these lines become infinitely crowded as they approach $(a,0)$. A coarse, hand-drawn plot with a finite number of lines cannot possibly capture this behavior. The basic premise of flux plotting—that the domain can be tiled by \"curvilinear squares\" where the heat flow per channel and temperature drop per square are constant—breaks down near the singularity.\n\nThe total heat rate $Q$ entering the left boundary is the integral of the flux density: $Q = \\int_0^H q_x(0,y) dy = \\int_0^H -k (\\partial T/\\partial x)|_{x=0} dy$. Since $Q$ is an integral quantity, regions where the integrand (the flux density) is very large will contribute disproportionately to the total value. The singularity at $(a,0)$ creates just such a region of high flux. Failure to accurately model the field in this vicinity will lead to a large error in the estimate of $Q$. Consequently, refining the flux plot (adding more lines) in the neighborhood of $(a,0)$ is the most effective way to improve the accuracy of the global heat rate estimate.\n\n**Option-by-Option Analysis**\n\n**A. Near a smooth boundary point where a Dirichlet condition meets a Neumann condition, the solution of the governing Laplace equation exhibits a local asymptotic form $T\\sim T_{\\star}+C\\,r^{1/2}\\Phi(\\theta)$ in polar coordinates $(r,\\theta)$ centered at the transition, implying $|\\nabla T|\\sim r^{-1/2}$.

The entire statement is logically and scientifically sound.\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\n**B. By conservation of energy, any local discretization errors near $(a,0)$ must cancel in the integral for $Q$, so once the net is reasonably resolved away from the transition, refining only a small neighborhood cannot change the estimated global heat rate.**\nThis statement is fundamentally flawed. Conservation of energy is the physical principle that leads to the governing Laplace equation ($\\nabla \\cdot \\vec{q} = 0$). It does not imply that approximation errors in a numerical or graphical solution method must cancel out. In fact, local errors, particularly in regions of high gradients (singularities), are notorious for polluting global integral quantities. The claim that local refinement near a singularity has no effect is contrary to the entire theory and practice of numerical analysis and mesh refinement.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**C. Refinement near singularities serves primarily to make the net appear smoother; mathematically, orthogonality away from the point $(a,0)$ suffices for an accurate global heat-rate estimate, and additional detail near the transition does not alter the result.**\nThis option misrepresents the purpose of refinement as being primarily aesthetic (\"smoother\"). Its main purpose is to improve accuracy. The claim that accuracy away from the singularity is sufficient is false. The total heat rate $Q$ is a global quantity obtained by integration. The region near the singularity, despite being small, has a very large flux density and can make a significant contribution to the integral. Ignoring this region by failing to refine the plot will lead to a systematically inaccurate estimate of $Q$.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**D. The heat flux density diverges so strongly at a Dirichlet–Neumann junction that the total heat rate $Q$ becomes infinite; local refinement merely pushes the divergence to smaller scales and does not improve the accuracy of any finite estimate of $Q$.**\nThis option correctly notes that the heat flux density diverges. However, it incorrectly concludes that the total heat rate $Q$ must be infinite. The strength of the singularity is crucial. As derived, $|\\nabla T| \\sim r^{-1/2}$. The heat flow crossing a small boundary segment of length $ds$ scales as $|\\nabla T| ds$. Integrating a function like $r^{-1/2}$ over a one-dimensional interval from $0$ to some value $\\epsilon$ yields a finite result: $\\int_0^{\\epsilon} r^{-1/2} dr = [2r^{1/2}]_0^{\\epsilon} = 2\\epsilon^{1/2}$. The singularity is \"integrable\", meaning the total heat rate $Q$ remains finite. Because $Q$ is finite, it is meaningful to seek an accurate estimate, and local refinement is the standard method for achieving this.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2487923"}]}
