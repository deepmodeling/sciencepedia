It poses a standard, canonical problem in transient heat conduction, a core topic in heat and mass transfer. The concepts of Biot number, Fourier number, separation of variables, eigenvalues ($\\,\\zeta_n\\,$), and the one-term approximation are fundamental to this subject. The problem provides all necessary definitions, including the characteristic lengths and the specific form of the spectral gap. The question is precise and asks for a quantitative comparison of well-defined physical and mathematical properties of the solutions for the different geometries. There are no contradictions, ambiguities, or factual errors. The problem setup is physically plausible as an idealized model and mathematically tractable.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is **valid**. A solution will be derived.\n\n### Derivation\nThe accuracy of the one-term approximation for the transient temperature distribution is determined by the rate at which higher-order terms in the series solution decay relative to the first term. The dimensionless temperature, $\\,\\theta = (T - T_{\\infty}) / (T_i - T_{\\infty})\\,$, for each geometry is given by an infinite series of the form:\n$$ \\theta(x^*, Fo) = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} A_n \\phi_n(x^*) e^{-\\zeta_n^2 Fo} $$\nwhere $\\,x^*\\,$ is the dimensionless spatial coordinate, $\\,\\phi_n(x^*)\\,$ are the eigenfunctions, $\\,\\zeta_n\\,$ are the eigenvalues, and $\\,A_n\\,$ are the expansion coefficients determined by the initial condition.\n\nThe one-term approximation consists of the $\\,n=1\\,$ term:\n$$ \\theta_1(x^*, Fo) = A_1 \\phi_1(x^*) e^{-\\zeta_1^2 Fo} $$\nThe error in this approximation is represented by the remainder of the series, which is dominated by the second term ($\\,n=2\\,$) for sufficiently large $\\,Fo\\,$. The ratio of the magnitude of the second term to the first term is proportional to:\n$$ \\frac{|A_2 \\phi_2(x^*)|}{|A_1 \\phi_1(x^*)|} e^{-(\\zeta_2^2 - \\zeta_1^2) Fo} = \\frac{|A_2 \\phi_2(x^*)|}{|A_1 \\phi_1(x^*)|} e^{-\\Delta Fo} $$\nwhere $\\,\\Delta = \\zeta_2^2 - \\zeta_1^2\\,$ is the defined spectral gap. For a given $\\,Fo  0\\,$, a larger value of $\\,\\Delta\\,$ causes the higher-order terms to decay more rapidly relative to the first term, making the one-term approximation more accurate. Therefore, the ordering of accuracy from most to least accurate directly corresponds to the ordering of the spectral gap $\\,\\Delta\\,$ from largest to smallest.\n\nWe must find the eigenvalues $\\,\\zeta_n\\,$ for each geometry by solving the respective transcendental characteristic equations for the specified case $\\,Bi=1\\,$.\n\n1.  **Plane Wall (half-thickness $\\,L\\,$)**\n    The characteristic equation is derived from the boundary condition $\\,-k(\\partial T/\\partial x)|_{x=L} = h(T(L,t)-T_{\\infty})\\,$. In dimensionless form, this leads to:\n    $$ \\zeta_n \\tan(\\zeta_n) = Bi $$\n    For $\\,Bi=1\\,$, we solve $\\,\\zeta \\tan(\\zeta) = 1\\,$. The first two positive roots are found numerically:\n    $$ \\zeta_{1, \\text{wall}} \\approx 0.8603 $$\n    $$ \\zeta_{2, \\text{wall}} \\approx 3.4256 $$\n    The spectral gap for the wall is:\n    $$ \\Delta_{\\text{wall}} = \\zeta_{2, \\text{wall}}^2 - \\zeta_{1, \\text{wall}}^2 \\approx (3.4256)^2 - (0.8603)^2 \\approx 11.7348 - 0.7401 \\approx 10.99 $$\n\n2.  **Long Cylinder (radius $\\,R\\,$)**\n    The characteristic equation is derived from the boundary condition at $\\,r=R\\,$ and involves Bessel functions of the first kind, $\\,J_0\\,$ and $\\,J_1\\,$:\n    $$ \\zeta_n \\frac{J_1(\\zeta_n)}{J_0(\\zeta_n)} = Bi $$\n    For $\\,Bi=1\\,$, we solve $\\,\\zeta J_1(\\zeta) = J_0(\\zeta)\\,$. The first two positive roots are found from standard tables or numerical solvers:\n    $$ \\zeta_{1, \\text{cylinder}} \\approx 1.2558 $$\n    $$ \\zeta_{2, \\text{cylinder}} \\approx 4.0795 $$\n    The spectral gap for the cylinder is:\n    $$ \\Delta_{\\text{cylinder}} = \\zeta_{2, \\text{cylinder}}^2 - \\zeta_{1, \\text{cylinder}}^2 \\approx (4.0795)^2 - (1.2558)^2 \\approx 16.6423 - 1.5770 \\approx 15.07 $$\n\n3.  **Sphere (radius $\\,R\\,$)**\n    The characteristic equation for the sphere is:\n    $$ 1 - \\zeta_n \\cot(\\zeta_n) = Bi $$\n    For $\\,Bi=1\\,$, the equation becomes $\\,1 - \\zeta \\cot(\\zeta) = 1\\,$, which simplifies to:\n    $$ \\zeta \\cot(\\zeta) = 0 $$\n    Since the eigenvalues must be positive ($\\,\\zeta  0\\,$), this requires $\\,\\cot(\\zeta) = 0\\,$. The positive roots are the values where the cosine is zero:\n    $$ \\zeta_n = \\frac{(2n-1)\\pi}{2} \\quad \\text{for } n=1, 2, 3, \\dots $$\n    The first two positive eigenvalues are:\n    $$ \\zeta_{1, \\text{sphere}} = \\frac{\\pi}{2} \\approx 1.5708 $$\n    $$ \\zeta_{2, \\text{sphere}} = \\frac{3\\pi}{2} \\approx 4.7124 $$\n    The spectral gap for the sphere is:\n    $$ \\Delta_{\\text{sphere}} = \\zeta_{2, \\text{sphere}}^2 - \\zeta_{1, \\text{sphere}}^2 = \\left(\\frac{3\\pi}{2}\\right)^2 - \\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\right)^2 = \\frac{9\\pi^2}{4} - \\frac{\\pi^2}{4} = \\frac{8\\pi^2}{4} = 2\\pi^2 \\approx 19.74 $$\n\n**Comparison**\nWe compare the calculated spectral gaps:\n- $\\,\\Delta_{\\text{wall}} \\approx 10.99\\,$\n- $\\,\\Delta_{\\text{cylinder}} \\approx 15.07\\,$\n- $\\,\\Delta_{\\text{sphere}} \\approx 19.74\\,$\n\nThe ordering from largest to smallest spectral gap is:\n$$ \\Delta_{\\text{sphere}}  \\Delta_{\\text{cylinder}}  \\Delta_{\\text{wall}} $$\nAs established, a larger spectral gap implies a more accurate one-term approximation for a given $\\,Fo\\,$. Thus, the ordering of accuracy from most accurate to least accurate is:\n$$ \\text{Sphere}  \\text{Cylinder}  \\text{Plane Wall} $$\nThis can be intuitively understood by the surface-area-to-volume ratio. A sphere has the largest surface-area-to-volume ratio for a given characteristic dimension ($\\,R\\,$), allowing it to cool faster and approach the final state (where the one-term approximation becomes highly accurate) more quickly. The plane wall, being effectively infinite in two dimensions, has the smallest surface-area-to-volume ratio and cools the slowest.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A.
