The problem statement is scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and contains all necessary information for its solution. Therefore, it is valid. We proceed with the derivation.\n\nThe fundamental principle governing the temperature distribution is the one-dimensional, steady-state heat diffusion equation with uniform volumetric heat generation $\\dot{q}'''$. For a material with constant thermal conductivity $k$, this equation is:\n$$ \\frac{d^2T}{dx^2} + \\frac{\\dot{q}'''}{k} = 0 $$\nThis second-order ordinary differential equation describes the temperature $T$ as a function of the spatial coordinate $x$. We will solve it over the domain $0 \\le x \\le L$, which represents half of the symmetric wall.\n\nIntegrating the equation once with respect to $x$ yields:\n$$ \\frac{dT}{dx} = -\\frac{\\dot{q}'''}{k}x + C_1 $$\nwhere $C_1$ is a constant of integration. The problem states that the wall is symmetric about its midplane at $x=0$. This symmetry imposes the boundary condition that the heat flux at the midplane is zero. According to Fourier's law of heat conduction, the heat flux is $q_x'' = -k \\frac{dT}{dx}$. Therefore, the symmetry condition is:\n$$ \\frac{dT}{dx}\\bigg|_{x=0} = 0 $$\nApplying this condition to the first integral gives:\n$$ 0 = -\\frac{\\dot{q}'''}{k}(0) + C_1 \\implies C_1 = 0 $$\nThus, the temperature gradient is $\\frac{dT}{dx} = -\\frac{\\dot{q}'''x}{k}$.\n\nIntegrating a second time with respect to $x$ gives the general temperature distribution:\n$$ T(x) = -\\frac{\\dot{q}'''}{2k}x^2 + C_2 $$\nwhere $C_2$ is the second constant of integration. We determine $C_2$ by applying the condition at the surface $x=L$, where the temperature is denoted as $T_s = T(L)$.\n$$ T(L) = T_s = -\\frac{\\dot{q}'''}{2k}L^2 + C_2 $$\nSolving for $C_2$:\n$$ C_2 = T_s + \\frac{\\dot{q}'''L^2}{2k} $$\nSubstituting this expression for $C_2$ back into the equation for $T(x)$, we obtain the temperature distribution in the half-slab $0 \\le x \\le L$:\n$$ T(x) = T_s + \\frac{\\dot{q}'''}{2k}(L^2 - x^2) $$\nThe temperature at the midplane, $T(0)$, is found by setting $x=0$:\n$$ T(0) = T_s + \\frac{\\dot{q}'''L^2}{2k} $$\nFrom this, we find the temperature difference between the midplane and the surface:\n$$ T(0) - T_s = \\frac{\\dot{q}'''L^2}{2k} $$\nThis expression explicitly shows that the temperature difference $T(0)-T_s$ is directly proportional to the heat generation rate $\\dot{q}'''$ and to the square of the half-thickness $L^2$.\n\nNext, we must determine the outward surface heat flux at $x=L$, denoted by $q_s''$. For steady-state conditions, an energy balance on the control volume defined by the half-slab from $x=0$ to $x=L$ dictates that the rate of heat leaving the control volume must equal the rate of heat generated within it. Since the heat flux at $x=0$ is zero due to symmetry, all generated heat in this volume must exit through the surface at $x=L$. The total heat generated per unit area in this volume is the volumetric rate multiplied by the thickness $L$:\n$$ q_s'' = \\dot{q}''' L $$\nThis result can be confirmed by applying Fourier's law at $x=L$:\n$$ q_s'' = -k\\frac{dT}{dx}\\bigg|_{x=L} = -k\\left(-\\frac{\\dot{q}'''L}{k}\\right) = \\dot{q}'''L $$\nThe two methods yield the same correct result.

Assuming $\\dot{q}''' \\neq 0$ and $L \\neq 0$, we can divide by $\\dot{q}'''L$:\n$$ R_{\\mathrm{app}}'' = \\frac{\\dot{q}'''L^2 / (2k)}{\\dot{q}'''L} = \\frac{L}{2k} $$\nThe expression for the apparent areal thermal resistance between the midplane and the surface is therefore $R_{\\mathrm{app}}'' = \\frac{L}{2k}$. The units of this quantity are $\\mathrm{m} / (\\mathrm{W} / (\\mathrm{m} \\cdot \\mathrm{K})) = \\mathrm{K} \\cdot \\mathrm{m}^2 / \\mathrm{W}$, which is consistent with the definition of an areal thermal resistance.\n\nFinally, we are asked to state whether $R_{\\mathrm{app}}''$ depends on $\\dot{q}'''$. Based on the derived expression $R_{\\mathrm{app}}'' = \\frac{L}{2k}$, the apparent thermal resistance depends only on the geometric parameter $L$ and the material property $k$. It does **not** depend on the volumetric heat generation rate $\\dot{q}'''$.

Since the expansion is about $T_0=T_{\\infty}$, we find:\n$$h_{\\text{rad}}(T_0) = 4 \\varepsilon \\sigma T_0^3$$\n\nPart 2: Derivation of the relative error $E(\\theta)$\n\nThe relative error $E$ is defined as:\n$$E = \\frac{q_{\\text{lin}} - q_{\\text{exact}}}{q_{\\text{exact}}}$$\nSubstituting the expressions for $q_{\\text{lin}}$ and $q_{\\text{exact}}$:\n$$E = \\frac{4 \\varepsilon \\sigma A T_{\\infty}^3 (T_s - T_{\\infty}) - \\varepsilon \\sigma A (T_s^4 - T_{\\infty}^4)}{\\varepsilon \\sigma A (T_s^4 - T_{\\infty}^4)}$$\nThe term $\\varepsilon \\sigma A$ cancels from the numerator and denominator:\n$$E = \\frac{4 T_{\\infty}^3 (T_s - T_{\\infty}) - (T_s^4 - T_{\\infty}^4)}{T_s^4 - T_{\\infty}^4} = \\frac{4 T_{\\infty}^3 (T_s - T_{\\infty})}{T_s^4 - T_{\\infty}^4} - 1$$\nWe must now express this in terms of the dimensionless temperature difference $\\theta = \\frac{\\Delta T}{T_0} = \\frac{T_s - T_{\\infty}}{T_{\\infty}}$, since $T_0 = T_{\\infty}$. From this definition, we have $T_s - T_{\\infty} = \\theta T_{\\infty}$ and $T_s = T_{\\infty}(1 + \\theta)$.\nLet's substitute these into the error expression. The numerator term is $4 T_{\\infty}^3 (T_s - T_{\\infty}) = 4 T_{\\infty}^3 (\\theta T_{\\infty}) = 4 \\theta T_{\\infty}^4$.\nThe denominator term is $T_s^4 - T_{\\infty}^4 = (T_{\\infty}(1+\\theta))^4 - T_{\\infty}^4 = T_{\\infty}^4 \\left( (1+\\theta)^4 - 1 \\right)$.\nSubstituting these into the expression for $E$:\n$$E(\\theta) = \\frac{4 \\theta T_{\\infty}^4}{T_{\\infty}^4 ((1+\\theta)^4 - 1)} - 1 = \\frac{4 \\theta}{(1+\\theta)^4 - 1} - 1$$\nWe expand the binomial term in the denominator: $(1+\\theta)^4 = 1 + 4\\theta + 6\\theta^2 + 4\\theta^3 + \\theta^4$.\nThus, the denominator is $(1+\\theta)^4 - 1 = 4\\theta + 6\\theta^2 + 4\\theta^3 + \\theta^4$. For $\\theta \\neq 0$, we can factor out $\\theta$:\n$$E(\\theta) = \\frac{4 \\theta}{\\theta (4 + 6\\theta + 4\\theta^2 + \\theta^3)} - 1 = \\frac{4}{4 + 6\\theta + 4\\theta^2 + \\theta^3} - 1$$\nCombining the terms over a common denominator yields the final closed-form expression for the relative error:\n$$E(\\theta) = \\frac{4 - (4 + 6\\theta + 4\\theta^2 + \\theta^3)}{4 + 6\\theta + 4\\theta^2 + \\theta^3} = \\frac{-6\\theta - 4\\theta^2 - \\theta^3}{4 + 6\\theta + 4\\theta^2 + \\theta^3}$$\n\nPart 3: Determination of the largest admissible value of $|\\Delta T|/T_{0}$\n\nWe are given the constraint $|E(\\theta)| \\le \\delta$, where $\\delta = 0.02$. We must find the largest value of $|\\theta|$ that satisfies this condition for both positive (heating) and negative (cooling) values of $\\theta$.\nLet us analyze the function $E(\\theta)$. The denominator is $D(\\theta) = 4 + 6\\theta + 4\\theta^2 + \\theta^3$. For physically meaningful temperatures, $T_s = T_{\\infty}(1+\\theta) > 0$, so $1+\\theta > 0$, which implies $\\theta > -1$. For $\\theta \\in (-1, \\infty)$ and $\\theta \\neq 0$, the denominator $D(\\theta) = \\frac{(1+\\theta)^4 - 1}{\\theta}$ is strictly positive. The numerator is $N(\\theta) = -\\theta(6 + 4\\theta + \\theta^2)$. The quadratic term $\\theta^2+4\\theta+6$ has a discriminant of $4^2 - 4(1)(6) = -8 < 0$, so it is always positive. Therefore, the sign of $E(\\theta)$ is determined by the sign of $-\\theta$.\n- For heating ($\\theta > 0$), $E(\\theta)$ is negative. The condition is $-E(\\theta) \\le \\delta$.\n- For cooling ($-1 < \\theta < 0$), $E(\\theta)$ is positive. The condition is $E(\\theta) \\le \\delta$.\n\nCase 1: Heating ($\\theta > 0$).\n$$-E(\\theta) = \\frac{6\\theta + 4\\theta^2 + \\theta^3}{4 + 6\\theta + 4\\theta^2 + \\theta^3} \\le \\delta$$\n$$6\\theta + 4\\theta^2 + \\theta^3 \\le \\delta(4 + 6\\theta + 4\\theta^2 + \\theta^3)$$\n$$(1-\\delta)\\theta^3 + (4-4\\delta)\\theta^2 + (6-6\\delta)\\theta - 4\\delta \\le 0$$\n$$(1-\\delta)(\\theta^3 + 4\\theta^2 + 6\\theta) - 4\\delta \\le 0$$\nLet $f(\\theta) = (1-\\delta)(\\theta^3 + 4\\theta^2 + 6\\theta) - 4\\delta$. Since $f(0) = -4\\delta < 0$ and $f'(\\theta) = (1-\\delta)(3\\theta^2 + 8\\theta + 6) > 0$ for all $\\theta$, $f(\\theta)$ is a monotonically increasing function. The inequality holds for $\\theta \\in [0, \\theta_+]$, where $\\theta_+$ is the positive root of $f(\\theta)=0$. Substituting $\\delta=0.02$:\n$$0.98(\\theta^3 + 4\\theta^2 + 6\\theta) - 4(0.02) = 0 \\implies \\theta^3 + 4\\theta^2 + 6\\theta - \\frac{4}{49} = 0$$\nSolving this cubic equation numerically gives the upper bound for heating: $\\theta_+ \\approx 0.0134839$.\n\nCase 2: Cooling ($-1 < \\theta < 0$).\n$$E(\\theta) = \\frac{-6\\theta - 4\\theta^2 - \\theta^3}{4 + 6\\theta + 4\\theta^2 + \\theta^3} \\le \\delta$$\n$$-6\\theta - 4\\theta^2 - \\theta^3 \\le \\delta(4 + 6\\theta + 4\\theta^2 + \\theta^3)$$\n$$0 \\le (1+\\delta)\\theta^3 + (4+4\\delta)\\theta^2 + (6+6\\delta)\\theta + 4\\delta$$\n$$0 \\le (1+\\delta)(\\theta^3 + 4\\theta^2 + 6\\theta) + 4\\delta$$\nLet $g(\\theta) = (1+\\delta)(\\theta^3 + 4\\theta^2 + 6\\theta) + 4\\delta$. $g(0) = 4\\delta > 0$ and $g'(\\theta) > 0$, so $g(\\theta)$ is also monotonically increasing. The inequality holds for $\\theta \\ge \\theta_-$, where $\\theta_-$ is the negative root of $g(\\theta)=0$. Substituting $\\delta=0.02$:\n$$1.02(\\theta^3 + 4\\theta^2 + 6\\theta) + 4(0.02) = 0 \\implies \\theta^3 + 4\\theta^2 + 6\\theta + \\frac{4}{51} = 0$$\nSolving this cubic equation numerically gives the lower bound for cooling: $\\theta_- \\approx -0.0131866$.\n\nThe total permissible range for $\\theta$ is $[\\theta_-, \\theta_+] \\approx [-0.0131866, 0.0134839]$. We need to find the largest value $|\\theta|_{\\text{max}}$ such that for any $\\theta$ in the symmetric interval $[ -|\\theta|_{\\text{max}}, |\\theta|_{\\text{max}} ]$, the error criterion is met. This requires the interval to be a subset of $[\\theta_-, \\theta_+]$. This implies:\n$$|\\theta|_{\\text{max}} \\le \\theta_+ \\quad \\text{and} \\quad -|\\theta|_{\\text{max}} \\ge \\theta_-$$\nThe second condition is equivalent to $|\\theta|_{\\text{max}} \\le -\\theta_- = |\\theta_-|$. To satisfy both, we must have:\n$$|\\theta|_{\\text{max}} \\le \\min(\\theta_+, |\\theta_-|)$$\n$$|\\theta|_{\\text{max}} \\le \\min(0.0134839, 0.0131866) = 0.0131866$$\nThe largest admissible value is therefore approximately $0.0131866$. The problem requires this value to be rounded to four significant figures.\n$0.0131866 \\approx 0.01319$.\nThis value represents the maximum allowable fractional temperature difference $|\\Delta T|/T_0$ to guarantee that the linearization error does not exceed $2\\%$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.01319}$$", "id": "2531314"}]}
