It is a well-posed, scientifically grounded problem in the field of heat transfer, specifically concerning steady-state, one-dimensional heat conduction through a composite cylinder. All necessary parameters and boundary conditions are provided, and there are no internal contradictions, ambiguities, or physical impossibilities. We shall proceed with the solution.\n\nThe problem is addressed in three parts. First, we derive the fundamental relationship for heat transfer through a single cylindrical layer. Second, we analyze the composite cylinder with perfect thermal contact. Third, we incorporate a thermal contact resistance and evaluate its impact.\n\nPart 1: Derivation for a Single Homogeneous Cylindrical Layer\n\nThe governing equation for steady-state, one-dimensional (radial) heat conduction with no heat generation in cylindrical coordinates is derived from the general heat diffusion equation. Under these conditions, the equation simplifies to:\n$$ \\frac{1}{r}\\frac{d}{dr}\\left(r k \\frac{dT}{dr}\\right) = 0 $$\nFor a material with constant thermal conductivity $k$, this becomes:\n$$ \\frac{d}{dr}\\left(r \\frac{dT}{dr}\\right) = 0 $$\nIntegrating this equation once with respect to the radial coordinate $r$ yields:\n$$ r \\frac{dT}{dr} = C_{1} $$\nwhere $C_{1}$ is a constant of integration. We can separate variables and integrate a second time:\n$$ \\int dT = \\int \\frac{C_{1}}{r} dr $$\nThis gives the general solution for the temperature field $T(r)$:\n$$ T(r) = C_{1} \\ln(r) + C_{2} $$\nwhere $C_{2}$ is the second integration constant.\n\nThe radial heat rate, $q_{r}$, is given by Fourier's law of conduction:\n$$ q_{r} = -k A_{r} \\frac{dT}{dr} $$\nwhere the area normal to heat flow is $A_{r} = 2\\pi r L$. Substituting the expression for the temperature gradient, $\\frac{dT}{dr} = \\frac{C_{1}}{r}$:\n$$ q_{r} = -k (2\\pi r L) \\left(\\frac{C_{1}}{r}\\right) = -2\\pi k L C_{1} $$\nSince $k$ and $L$ are constants, the heat rate $q_{r}$ must be a constant, independent of radius, which we denote as $q$. This is a direct consequence of the steady-state energy balance with no internal generation. We can express the constant $C_{1}$ in terms of the heat rate $q$:\n$$ C_{1} = -\\frac{q}{2\\pi k L} $$\nNow consider a single cylindrical layer between an inner radius $r_{i}$ and an outer radius $r_{o}$, with corresponding temperatures $T_{i}$ and $T_{o}$. We apply these boundary conditions to the general solution for $T(r)$:\n$$ T_{i} = T(r_{i}) = C_{1} \\ln(r_{i}) + C_{2} $$\n$$ T_{o} = T(r_{o}) = C_{1} \\ln(r_{o}) + C_{2} $$\nSubtracting the second equation from the first to eliminate $C_{2}$:\n$$ T_{i} - T_{o} = C_{1} (\\ln(r_{i}) - \\ln(r_{o})) = C_{1} \\ln\\left(\\frac{r_{i}}{r_{o}}\\right) = -C_{1} \\ln\\left(\\frac{r_{o}}{r_{i}}\\right) $$\nSubstituting the expression for $C_{1}$:\n$$ T_{i} - T_{o} = -\\left(-\\frac{q}{2\\pi k L}\\right) \\ln\\left(\\frac{r_{o}}{r_{i}}\\right) = \\frac{q}{2\\pi k L} \\ln\\left(\\frac{r_{o}}{r_{i}}\\right) $$\nThis equation relates the temperature drop across the layer to the heat rate. It can be rearranged to express the heat rate as a function of the temperature drop and the system's properties, analogous to Ohm's law:\n$$ q = \\frac{T_{i} - T_{o}}{R_{th}} $$\nwhere the thermal resistance of the hollow cylindrical layer, $R_{th}$, is defined as:\n$$ R_{th} = \\frac{\\ln(r_{o}/r_{i})}{2\\pi k L} $$\nThis completes the required derivation.\n\nPart 2: Analysis without Contact Resistance\n\nFor the three-layer composite cylinder with perfect thermal contact, the total heat transfer rate $q_{no\\_c}$ is constant through each layer. The system can be modeled as three thermal resistances in series. The resistances of the three layers are:\n$$ R_{1} = \\frac{\\ln(r_{2}/r_{1})}{2\\pi k_{1} L} $$\n$$ R_{2} = \\frac{\\ln(r_{3}/r_{2})}{2\\pi k_{2} L} $$\n$$ R_{3} = \\frac{\\ln(r_{4}/r_{3})}{2\\pi k_{3} L} $$\nThe total thermal resistance, $R_{tot}$, is the sum of the individual resistances:\n$$ R_{tot} = R_{1} + R_{2} + R_{3} $$\nThe total heat rate is then:\n$$ q_{no\\_c} = \\frac{T_{1} - T_{4}}{R_{tot}} $$\nUsing the provided data:\n$L = 0.75 \\ \\mathrm{m}$, $r_{1} = 0.05 \\ \\mathrm{m}$, $r_{2} = 0.065 \\ \\mathrm{m}$, $r_{3} = 0.085 \\ \\mathrm{m}$, $r_{4} = 0.110 \\ \\mathrm{m}$.\n$k_{1} = 15 \\ \\mathrm{W}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-1}\\,\\mathrm{K}^{-1}$, $k_{2} = 0.30 \\ \\mathrm{W}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-1}\\,\\mathrm{K}^{-1}$, $k_{3} = 1.20 \\ \\mathrm{W}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-1}\\,\\mathrm{K}^{-1}$.\n$T_{1} = 475 \\ \\mathrm{K}$, $T_{4} = 300 \\ \\mathrm{K}$.\n\nWe compute the resistances:\n$$ R_{1} = \\frac{\\ln(0.065/0.05)}{2\\pi (15)(0.75)} = \\frac{\\ln(1.3)}{22.5\\pi} \\approx 0.0037119 \\ \\mathrm{K/W} $$\n$$ R_{2} = \\frac{\\ln(0.085/0.065)}{2\\pi (0.30)(0.75)} = \\frac{\\ln(1.30769...)}{0.45\\pi} \\approx 0.189730 \\ \\mathrm{K/W} $$\n$$ R_{3} = \\frac{\\ln(0.110/0.085)}{2\\pi (1.20)(0.75)} = \\frac{\\ln(1.29411...)}{1.8\\pi} \\approx 0.0455943 \\ \\mathrm{K/W} $$\nThe total resistance is:\n$$ R_{tot} = 0.0037119 + 0.189730 + 0.0455943 \\approx 0.239036 \\ \\mathrm{K/W} $$\nThe total heat rate is:\n$$ q_{no\\_c} = \\frac{475 - 300}{0.239036} = \\frac{175}{0.239036} \\approx 732.11 \\ \\mathrm{W} $$\nThe interfacial temperatures $T_{2}$ (at $r=r_{2}$) and $T_{3}$ (at $r=r_{3}$) are found using the heat rate:\n$$ q_{no\\_c} = \\frac{T_{1} - T_{2}}{R_{1}} \\implies T_{2} = T_{1} - q_{no\\_c}R_{1} $$\n$$ T_{2} = 475 - (732.11)(0.0037119) \\approx 475 - 2.718 = 472.28 \\ \\mathrm{K} $$\n$$ q_{no\\_c} = \\frac{T_{2} - T_{3}}{R_{2}} \\implies T_{3} = T_{2} - q_{no\\_c}R_{2} $$\n$$ T_{3} = 472.28 - (732.11)(0.189730) \\approx 472.28 - 138.90 = 333.38 \\ \\mathrm{K} $$\n\nPart 3: Analysis with Contact Resistance\n\nA thermal contact resistance, $R_{c}$, is introduced at the interface $r=r_{3}$. This resistance is related to the area-specific contact resistance $R_{c}''$ by $R_{c} = R_{c}''/A_{3}$, where $A_{3} = 2\\pi r_{3} L$.\nGiven $R_{c}'' = 1.80 \\times 10^{-4} \\ \\mathrm{m}^{2}\\,\\mathrm{K}\\,\\mathrm{W}^{-1}$:\n$$ A_{3} = 2\\pi (0.085)(0.75) = 0.1275\\pi \\approx 0.400553 \\ \\mathrm{m}^{2} $$\n$$ R_{c} = \\frac{1.80 \\times 10^{-4}}{0.400553} \\approx 0.00044938 \\ \\mathrm{K/W} $$\nThis contact resistance is added in series to the network. The new total resistance, $R'_{tot}$, is:\n$$ R'_{tot} = R_{1} + R_{2} + R_{c} + R_{3} = 0.239036 + 0.00044938 = 0.239485 \\ \\mathrm{K/W} $$\nThe new heat rate, $q_{c}$, is:\n$$ q_{c} = \\frac{T_{1} - T_{4}}{R'_{tot}} = \\frac{475 - 300}{0.239485} \\approx 730.73 \\ \\mathrm{W} $$\nThe new interfacial temperatures are calculated. Let $T'_{3-}$ and $T'_{3+}$ be the temperatures on the inner and outer sides of the interface at $r=r_{3}$, respectively.\n$$ T'_{2} = T_{1} - q_{c}R_{1} = 475 - (730.73)(0.0037119) \\approx 475 - 2.713 = 472.29 \\ \\mathrm{K} $$\n$$ T'_{3-} = T'_{2} - q_{c}R_{2} = 472.29 - (730.73)(0.189730) \\approx 472.29 - 138.64 = 333.65 \\ \\mathrm{K} $$\nThe temperature drop across the contact resistance is $\\Delta T_{c} = q_{c}R_{c} = T'_{3-} - T'_{3+}$.\n$$ \\Delta T_{c} = (730.73)(0.00044938) \\approx 0.328 \\ \\mathrm{K} $$\nThus, $T'_{3+} = 333.65 - 0.328 = 333.32 \\ \\mathrm{K}$.

It is a standard problem in the field of microscale heat transfer, combining Fourier's law of heat conduction with kinetic theory corrections for boundary effects in a rarefied gas. The problem is therefore deemed valid and a solution will be provided.\n\nThe first task is to derive an expression for the gas-phase heat transfer coefficient, $h_{gas}$. We consider steady-state, one-dimensional heat transfer across a gas layer of thickness $t_g$ separating two parallel plane surfaces at temperatures $T_{s1}$ and $T_{s2}$. Let the coordinate $x$ be normal to the surfaces, with the first surface at $x=0$ and the second at $x=t_g$.\n\nUnder the assumption of constant gas thermal conductivity $k_g$ and no internal heat generation, the conservation of energy equation for the gas phase is\n$$\n\\frac{d}{dx}\\left(k_g \\frac{dT}{dx}\\right) = 0\n$$\nwhich simplifies to\n$$\n\\frac{d^2T}{dx^2} = 0\n$$\nThe general solution to this equation is a linear temperature profile within the gas:\n$$\nT_g(x) = C_1 x + C_2\n$$\nwhere $C_1$ and $C_2$ are constants of integration. The heat flux, $q''$, is constant throughout the gap and is given by Fourier's law:\n$$\nq'' = -k_g \\frac{dT_g}{dx} = -k_g C_1\n$$\nThis implies that the temperature gradient is constant, $C_1 = -q''/k_g$.\n\nAt the microscale, the gas temperature immediately adjacent to a solid surface is not equal to the surface temperature. This phenomenon is known as the temperature jump. The problem specifies a first-order temperature-jump boundary condition at each wall. Let us assume $T_{s1} > T_{s2}$, so heat flows in the positive $x$-direction ($q'' > 0$) and the temperature gradient $dT_g/dx$ is negative.\n\nAt the first wall ($x=0$, surface temperature $T_{s1}$), the extrapolated gas temperature $T_g(0)$ is lower than $T_{s1}$. The temperature jump is given by:\n$$\nT_{s1} - T_g(0) = -C_T \\lambda \\left(\\frac{dT_g}{dx}\\right)_{x=0}\n$$\nwhere $\\lambda$ is the gas mean free path and $C_T$ is the temperature-jump coefficient.\n\nAt the second wall ($x=t_g$, surface temperature $T_{s2}$), the extrapolated gas temperature $T_g(t_g)$ is higher than $T_{s2}$.

Evaluate these ratios numerically using the data above. Here $R_{\\mathrm{con}}$ is the overall thermal contact resistance per unit nominal area associated with the ensemble of microcontacts. Round your final numerical results to three significant figures. Report your answer as a two-entry row matrix $\\big[A_{r,C}/A_{r,B},\\ R_{\\mathrm{con},C}/R_{\\mathrm{con},B}\\big]$ with no units.", "solution": "The problem is subjected to validation and is found to be valid. It is scientifically grounded in the principles of contact mechanics and heat transfer, well-posed, and objective. There are no contradictions, and the provided data are sufficient for a unique solution. We shall proceed with the derivation.\n\nThe problem requires the derivation and evaluation of two ratios: the ratio of real contact areas, $A_{r,C}/A_{r,B}$, and the ratio of thermal contact resistances per unit nominal area, $R_{\\mathrm{con},C}/R_{\\mathrm{con},B}$.\n\nFirst, we address the ratio of real contact areas, $A_{r,C}/A_{r,B}$.\nThe problem states that fully plastic asperity deformation governs the contact. Under this condition, the real contact area, $A_r$, is determined by the balance between the total applied normal force, $F$, and the indentation hardness of the softer material in contact, $H$. This relationship is given by:\n$$A_r = \\frac{F}{H}$$\nThe total applied force $F$ is the product of the uniform nominal pressure $P$ and the nominal contact area $A_n$:\n$$F = P A_n$$\nSince both $P$ and $A_n$ are fixed for both trials, the force $F$ is constant. Thus, the real contact area is inversely proportional to the effective hardness of the interface:\n$$A_r \\propto \\frac{1}{H}$$\n\nFor Trial B (baseline), the contact is between two identical base metal solids. The hardness of both surfaces is $H_b$. Therefore, the effective hardness is $H_B = H_b$. The real contact area for Trial B is:\n$$A_{r,B} = \\frac{P A_n}{H_b}$$\n\nFor Trial C (coated), the contact is between a coated solid (hardness $H_c$) and an uncoated base metal solid (hardness $H_b$). The problem specifies that the mean contact pressure equals the indentation hardness of the softer surface. We are given $H_c = 0.80 \\times 10^9\\ \\mathrm{Pa}$ and $H_b = 3.0 \\times 10^9\\ \\mathrm{Pa}$. Since $H_c < H_b$, the coating is the softer material. The effective hardness for Trial C is therefore $H_C = H_c$. The real contact area for Trial C is:\n$$A_{r,C} = \\frac{P A_n}{H_c}$$\n\nThe ratio of the real contact areas is then:\n$$\\frac{A_{r,C}}{A_{r,B}} = \\frac{P A_n / H_c}{P A_n / H_b} = \\frac{H_b}{H_c}$$\nThis is the symbolic expression for the first requested ratio.\n\nNext, we derive the ratio of the thermal contact resistances, $R_{\\mathrm{con},C}/R_{\\mathrm{con},B}$.\nThe overall thermal contact resistance per unit nominal area, $R_{\\mathrm{con}}$, is the inverse of the thermal contact conductance per unit nominal area, $h_c$.\n$$R_{\\mathrm{con}} = \\frac{1}{h_c}$$\nFor heat flow through a multitude of microcontacts, the total conductance is a function of the material properties, the surface topography, and the real area of contact. According to the Cooper-Mikic-Yovanovich (CMY) model for plastic contacts, which is consistent with the problem's assumptions (identical surface topography, plastic deformation, self-similar scaling), the conductance $h_c$ is given by:\n$$h_c = C_1 k_s \\frac{A_r}{A_n}$$\nwhere $C_1$ is a constant determined by the surface topography (specifically, the RMS slope of the asperities), and $k_s$ is the effective thermal conductivity of the contacting pair. The real area fraction $A_r/A_n$ can be expressed as $P/H$. Therefore:\n$$h_c = C_1 k_s \\frac{P}{H}$$\nSince the nominal pressure $P$ and the surface topography (and thus $C_1$) are identical for both trials, the conductance $h_c$ is directly proportional to the ratio $k_s/H$.\n$$h_c \\propto \\frac{k_s}{H}$$\nConsequently, the resistance $R_{\\mathrm{con}}$ is proportional to $H/k_s$:\n$$R_{\\mathrm{con}} \\propto \\frac{H}{k_s}$$\nThe effective thermal conductivity, $k_s$, for contact between two semi-infinite solids with thermal conductivities $k_1$ and $k_2$ is defined as the harmonic mean:\n$$k_s = \\frac{2 k_1 k_2}{k_1 + k_2}$$\n\nFor Trial B, the contact is between two solids of the same base metal ($k_1 = k_2 = k_b$). The effective hardness is $H_B = H_b$. The effective conductivity is:\n$$k_{s,B} = \\frac{2 k_b k_b}{k_b + k_b} = k_b$$\nThe resistance for Trial B is proportional to:\n$$R_{\\mathrm{con},B} \\propto \\frac{H_b}{k_b}$$\n\nFor Trial C, the contact is between the coating ($k_c$) and the base metal ($k_b$). The problem states the coating is sufficiently thick ($t \\gg a$) to be treated as a semi-infinite solid for the thermal analysis. The effective hardness is $H_C = H_c$. The effective conductivity is:\n$$k_{s,C} = \\frac{2 k_c k_b}{k_c + k_b}$$\nThe resistance for Trial C is proportional to:\n$$R_{\\mathrm{con},C} \\propto \\frac{H_c}{k_{s,C}} = \\frac{H_c (k_c + k_b)}{2 k_c k_b}$$\n\nThe ratio of the thermal contact resistances is:\n$$\\frac{R_{\\mathrm{con},C}}{R_{\\mathrm{con},B}} = \\frac{H_C / k_{s,C}}{H_B / k_{s,B}} = \\frac{H_c / \\left(\\frac{2 k_c k_b}{k_c + k_b}\\right)}{H_b / k_b} = \\frac{H_c}{H_b} \\cdot \\frac{k_b}{\\frac{2 k_c k_b}{k_c + k_b}} = \\frac{H_c}{H_b} \\cdot \\frac{k_b(k_c + k_b)}{2 k_c k_b}$$\nSimplifying the expression yields:\n$$\\frac{R_{\\mathrm{con},C}}{R_{\\mathrm{con},B}} = \\frac{H_c}{H_b} \\frac{k_c + k_b}{2 k_c}$$\nThis is the symbolic expression for the second requested ratio.\n\nFinally, we evaluate these ratios numerically using the provided data:\n$k_b = 45\\ \\mathrm{W\\,m^{-1}\\,K^{-1}}$\n$H_b = 3.0 \\times 10^{9}\\ \\mathrm{Pa}$\n$k_c = 400\\ \\mathrm{W\\,m^{-1}\\,K^{-1}}$\n$H_c = 0.80 \\times 10^{9}\\ \\mathrm{Pa}$\n\nFor the ratio of real contact areas:\n$$\\frac{A_{r,C}}{A_{r,B}} = \\frac{H_b}{H_c} = \\frac{3.0 \\times 10^9}{0.80 \\times 10^9} = \\frac{3.0}{0.80} = 3.75$$\n\nFor the ratio of thermal contact resistances:\n$$\\frac{R_{\\mathrm{con},C}}{R_{\\mathrm{con},B}} = \\frac{H_c}{H_b} \\frac{k_c + k_b}{2 k_c} = \\left(\\frac{0.80 \\times 10^9}{3.0 \\times 10^9}\\right) \\frac{400 + 45}{2 \\times 400}$$\n$$\\frac{R_{\\mathrm{con},C}}{R_{\\mathrm{con},B}} = \\left(\\frac{0.80}{3.0}\\right) \\frac{445}{800} = \\frac{0.80 \\times 445}{3.0 \\times 800} = \\frac{356}{2400} = \\frac{89}{600}$$\nNumerically, this is approximately $0.148333...$. Rounding to three significant figures, we get $0.148$.\n\nThe final answer consists of the two evaluated ratios, $3.75$ and $0.148$.", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{ \\begin{bmatrix} 3.75 & 0.148 \\end{bmatrix} } $$", "id": "2472084"}]}
