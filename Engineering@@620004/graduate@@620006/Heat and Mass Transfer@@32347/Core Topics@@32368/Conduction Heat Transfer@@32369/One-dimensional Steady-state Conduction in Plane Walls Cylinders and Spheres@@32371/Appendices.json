This exercise requires deriving the governing differential equation for steady, one-dimensional radial heat conduction and applying physical reasoning to determine the temperature distribution.

It is a standard problem in the field of heat and mass transfer, specifically concerning one-dimensional steady-state conduction. The givens are sufficient and non-contradictory. Therefore, the problem is valid, and a solution will be derived from first principles as requested.\n\nThe analysis begins with the principle of conservation of energy applied to a control volume within the solid cylinder. Consider a cylindrical shell of infinitesimal thickness $dr$ at a radial location $r$, with a length $L$. The cylinder is homogeneous and isotropic with constant thermal conductivity $k$. The problem specifies a steady state ($\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t} = 0$) and no internal heat generation ($\\dot{q}_{gen} = 0$). Conduction is purely one-dimensional in the radial direction ($r$).\n\nThe energy balance equation for the control volume is:\n$$ \\dot{E}_{in} - \\dot{E}_{out} + \\dot{E}_{gen} = \\dot{E}_{st} $$\nGiven the problem conditions, the rate of energy generation $\\dot{E}_{gen}$ is zero, and the rate of change of stored energy $\\dot{E}_{st}$ is zero (steady state). Thus, the energy balance simplifies to:\n$$ \\dot{E}_{in} = \\dot{E}_{out} $$\nLet $\\dot{Q}_r$ be the rate of heat transfer in the radial direction. The energy entering the control volume is the heat conducted through the inner cylindrical surface at radius $r$, which is $\\dot{Q}_r$. The energy leaving is the heat conducted through the outer surface at radius $r+dr$, which is $\\dot{Q}_{r+dr}$. The balance becomes:\n$$ \\dot{Q}_r = \\dot{Q}_{r+dr} $$\nThis implies that the radial heat transfer rate $\\dot{Q}_r$ must be constant with respect to $r$.\n\nAccording to Fourier's law of heat conduction, the heat transfer rate is given by:\n$$ \\dot{Q}_r = -k A_r \\frac{dT}{dr} $$\nwhere $A_r$ is the surface area for heat transfer at radius $r$. For a cylinder of length $L$, this area is $A_r = 2 \\pi r L$. Substituting this into the expression for $\\dot{Q}_r$:\n$$ \\dot{Q}_r = -k (2 \\pi r L) \\frac{dT}{dr} $$\nSince $\\dot{Q}_r$ is constant, and $k$, $2$, $\\pi$, and $L$ are also constants, it follows that the quantity $r \\frac{dT}{dr}$ must be a constant. Let us formalize this by returning to the differential energy balance.\nThe relation $\\dot{Q}_r = \\dot{Q}_{r+dr}$ can be written as $\\dot{Q}_{r+dr} - \\dot{Q}_r = 0$. Dividing by the volume of the shell, $dV = 2 \\pi r L dr$, and taking the limit as $dr \\to 0$ would lead to the general heat diffusion equation. Alternatively, and more directly for this problem, we can express $\\dot{Q}_{r+dr}$ using a Taylor series expansion around $r$:\n$$ \\dot{Q}_{r+dr} = \\dot{Q}_r + \\frac{d\\dot{Q}_r}{dr}dr + O((dr)^2) $$\nSubstituting this into the energy balance $\\dot{Q}_{r+dr} - \\dot{Q}_r = 0$ gives:\n$$ \\frac{d\\dot{Q}_r}{dr}dr = 0 $$\nSince $dr$ is non-zero, this requires $\\frac{d\\dot{Q}_r}{dr} = 0$.\n\nNow, we substitute the expression for $\\dot{Q}_r$ from Fourier's law:\n$$ \\frac{d}{dr} \\left( -k (2 \\pi r L) \\frac{dT}{dr} \\right) = 0 $$\nSince $-k$, $2$, $\\pi$, and $L$ are non-zero constants, they can be divided out, yielding the governing ordinary differential equation for the temperature field $T(r)$:\n$$ \\frac{d}{dr} \\left( r \\frac{dT}{dr} \\right) = 0 $$\nThis completes the first part of the task.\n\nFor the second part, we solve this differential equation. We integrate with respect to $r$ once:\n$$ \\int \\frac{d}{dr} \\left( r \\frac{dT}{dr} \\right) dr = \\int 0 dr $$\n$$ r \\frac{dT}{dr} = C_1 $$\nwhere $C_1$ is the first constant of integration. To isolate the derivative $\\frac{dT}{dr}$, we divide by $r$ (for $r \\neq 0$):\n$$ \\frac{dT}{dr} = \\frac{C_1}{r} $$\nWe integrate a second time with respect to $r$:\n$$ \\int dT = \\int \\frac{C_1}{r} dr $$\n$$ T(r) = C_1 \\ln(r) + C_2 $$\nwhere $C_2$ is the second constant of integration. This is the general form of the solution for $T(r)$.\n\nFor the third part, we determine the constants $C_1$ and $C_2$ by applying the physical constraints and boundary conditions.\nThe first condition is the physical admissibility (regularity) at the centerline of the cylinder, $r=0$. The problem states that the temperature field must be finite everywhere, including at the axis. The general solution is $T(r) = C_1 \\ln(r) + C_2$. As $r \\to 0$, the natural logarithm term $\\ln(r) \\to -\\infty$. If the constant $C_1$ were non-zero, the temperature at the centerline $T(0)$ would be singular (infinite). This is physically impossible and would correspond to a line source or sink of infinite strength at the axis, which is explicitly excluded by the problem statement. Therefore, to ensure a finite temperature at $r=0$, the coefficient of the logarithmic term must be zero.\n$$ C_1 = 0 $$\nThis condition reduces the temperature distribution to:\n$$ T(r) = C_2 $$\nThis means the temperature must be uniform throughout the cylinder.\n\nThe second condition is the boundary condition at the outer surface, $r=R$. The problem specifies that the temperature is maintained at a fixed, uniform value $T_s$.\n$$ T(R) = T_s $$\nApplying this condition to our simplified solution $T(r) = C_2$:\n$$ T(R) = C_2 = T_s $$\nThus, the constant $C_2$ must be equal to the surface temperature $T_s$.\n\nSubstituting the values of $C_1=0$ and $C_2=T_s$ into the general solution, we obtain the final expression for the temperature distribution within the cylinder for $0 \\le r \\le R$:\n$$ T(r) = T_s $$\nThis result is physically logical. In a steady-state system with no internal heat sources, a temperature gradient can only be maintained by a net flow of heat. Since the outer surface is at a uniform temperature $T_s$ and there are no sources or sinks within the domain, there can be no net heat flow in the radial direction. According to Fourier's law, zero heat flow ($\\dot{Q}_r=0$) implies a zero temperature gradient ($\\frac{dT}{dr}=0$). This means the temperature must be constant throughout the material. Since the temperature is $T_s$ at the boundary $r=R$, it must be $T_s$ everywhere.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{T(r) = T_s}\n$$", "id": "2513124"}, {"introduction": "Building on the foundational case, this next practice challenges your conceptual understanding of heat flow in cylindrical geometries.

It is a standard, well-posed problem in heat transfer theory. A solution will be derived.\n\n### Derivation from First Principles\n\nThe governing equation for heat conduction is the heat diffusion equation. In cylindrical coordinates $(r, \\phi, z)$, it is:\n$$ \\frac{1}{r} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial r} \\left( k r \\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial r} \\right) + \\frac{1}{r^2} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\phi} \\left( k \\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial \\phi} \\right) + \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z} \\left( k \\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial z} \\right) + \\dot{q} = \\rho c_p \\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial t} $$\nThe problem states the conditions are steady-state ($\\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial t} = 0$), one-dimensional radial conduction ($\\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial \\phi} = \\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial z} = 0$), with no internal heat generation ($\\dot{q} = 0$) and constant thermal conductivity ($k$). Applying these conditions simplifies the equation to:\n$$ \\frac{1}{r} \\frac{d}{dr} \\left( k r \\frac{dT}{dr} \\right) = 0 $$\nSince $k$ is a non-zero constant, this further simplifies to:\n$$ \\frac{d}{dr} \\left( r \\frac{dT}{dr} \\right) = 0 $$\nThis equation represents the conservation of energy for the specified conditions. Integrating with respect to $r$ yields:\n$$ r \\frac{dT}{dr} = C_1 $$\nwhere $C_1$ is a constant of integration. We can perform a second integration to find the temperature profile $T(r)$:\n$$ \\frac{dT}{dr} = \\frac{C_1}{r} $$\n$$ \\int dT = \\int \\frac{C_1}{r} dr $$\n$$ T(r) = C_1 \\ln r + C_2 $$\nwhere $C_2$ is the second integration constant. This derivation proves that for the given conditions, the temperature profile must be logarithmic.\n\nNow, we relate this result to the heat rate $Q(r)$ and heat flux $q_r''(r)$.\nFourier's law of heat conduction in the radial direction is:\n$$ q_r''(r) = -k \\frac{dT}{dr} $$\nThe total heat rate $Q(r)$ through a cylindrical surface of area $A(r) = 2\\pi r L$ is:\n$$ Q(r) = q_r''(r) \\, A(r) = \\left( -k \\frac{dT}{dr} \\right) (2 \\pi r L) = -2 \\pi k L \\left( r \\frac{dT}{dr} \\right) $$\nFrom our first integration of the energy equation, we found that $r \\frac{dT}{dr} = C_1$. Substituting this into the expression for $Q(r)$:\n$$ Q(r) = -2 \\pi k L C_1 $$\nSince $k$, $L$, and $C_1$ are constants, the total heat rate $Q(r)$ must be constant for all $r$. Let us denote this constant rate as $Q$.\n$$ Q = \\text{constant} $$\nThis result is physically necessary: under steady-state conditions with no heat generation, the rate of energy flowing through any cylindrical surface must be the same, otherwise energy would accumulate or be depleted within the material, contradicting the steady-state assumption.\n\nNext, we analyze the local heat flux, $q_r''(r)$:\n$$ q_r''(r) = \\frac{Q(r)}{A(r)} = \\frac{Q}{2 \\pi r L} $$\nSince $Q$ and $L$ are constants, the heat flux $q_r''(r)$ is inversely proportional to the radius $r$:\n$$ q_r''(r) \\propto \\frac{1}{r} $$\nThe heat flux is therefore not constant; it decreases as the radius increases because the same total amount of heat $Q$ is flowing through a progressively larger area $A(r)$.\n\nIn summary, a logarithmic temperature profile is the unique solution for the stated conditions. It is compatible with a constant total heat rate $Q$, but incompatible with a constant local heat flux $q_r''$.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\nA. Under steady state with no internal generation, the local energy balance in cylindrical coordinates requires $\\dfrac{1}{r}\\dfrac{d}{dr}\\!\\left(r\\,q_r''\\right) = 0$, which implies $r\\,q_r'' = \\text{constant} = Q/(2\\pi L)$, so $q_r'' \\propto 1/r$. Using Fourier’s law $q_r'' = -k\\,dT/dr$, integrating yields $T(r) = C_1 \\ln r + C_2$. Thus, the logarithmic profile is precisely the one for which $Q = 2\\pi L\\,r\\,q_r''$ is independent of $r$.\n**Analysis**: This statement correctly identifies the differential form of the energy balance in terms of heat flux, $\\frac{d}{dr}(r q_r'') = 0$. This integrates to $r q_r'' = \\text{constant}$. Recognizing that $Q = 2\\pi L (r q_r'')$, this correctly implies $Q$ is constant and $q_r'' \\propto 1/r$. It then correctly uses Fourier's law to show that this condition leads to a logarithmic temperature profile. The argument is rigorous and entirely correct.\n**Verdict**: Correct.\n\nB. If $T(r)$ is logarithmic, then $dT/dr \\propto 1/r$. In the expression $Q = -k\\,A(r)\\,dT/dr = -k\\,(2\\pi L r)\\,dT/dr$, the factor $r$ in $A(r)$ cancels the $1/r$ in $dT/dr$, yielding a constant $Q$, whereas the local heat flux $q_r'' = Q/A(r) \\propto 1/r$ and therefore is not constant.\n**Analysis**: This option starts by assuming the logarithmic profile $T(r) \\propto \\ln r$, which implies $dT/dr \\propto 1/r$. It correctly substitutes this into the equation for the total heat rate $Q(r) = -k(2\\pi r L)(dT/dr)$ and observes that the $r$ from the area $A(r)$ cancels with the $1/r$ from the temperature gradient, resulting in a constant $Q$. It then correctly deduces that the flux $q_r'' = Q/A(r)$ must vary as $1/r$. This is a valid and physically intuitive explanation.\n**Verdict**: Correct.\n\nC. In cylindrical radial conduction, the area available for heat flow is independent of radius, so a logarithmic temperature profile is needed to keep $q_r''$ constant while $Q$ varies with $r$.\n**Analysis**: The first premise, \"the area available for heat flow is independent of radius,\" is fundamentally false. The area for radial heat flow in a cylinder is $A(r) = 2\\pi r L$, which is a linear function of radius $r$. This false premise invalidates the entire argument that follows. Both conclusions ($q_r''$ is constant and $Q$ varies) are the opposite of what is true.\n**Verdict**: Incorrect.\n\nD. If $q_r''$ were constant with $r$ under steady, no-generation conditions, then $Q(r) = q_r''\\,2\\pi L r$ would increase linearly with $r$, contradicting steady energy conservation unless heat is added within the wall. Therefore, a constant $q_r''$ is incompatible with steady, purely conductive cylindrical transfer without generation.\n**Analysis**: This statement provides a correct proof by contradiction. It assumes a constant heat flux $q_r''$. Under this assumption, the total heat rate $Q(r) = q_r'' A(r) = q_r'' (2\\pi L r)$ would indeed be a linear function of $r$. An increasing heat rate, $dQ/dr > 0$, implies that there is a net source of energy within any differential cylindrical shell. This contradicts the given condition of no internal heat generation. Therefore, the initial premise of constant flux must be false. This correctly explains why $q_r''$ cannot be constant.\n**Verdict**: Correct.\n\nE. A logarithmic temperature profile in a cylinder can only arise if $k$ varies with radius as $k \\propto r$; with constant $k$, a logarithmic profile is incompatible with steady radial conduction.\n**Analysis**: This statement is the direct opposite of the truth. As derived from first principles, a logarithmic temperature profile is precisely the solution that arises for a **constant** thermal conductivity $k$. If $k$ varied with radius, the temperature profile would take a different form. For example, if $k(r) = c' r$, the energy equation becomes $\\frac{d}{dr}(c'r^2 \\frac{dT}{dr})=0$, which integrates to $T(r) = C'_1/r+C'_2$.

Derivation of Estimators for $\\dot{q}'''$**\n\nWe are tasked to derive two independent estimators for the volumetric heat generation rate, $\\dot{q}'''$.\n\nFirst Estimator: Based on Surface Convection Measurements ($\\dot{q}'''_{\\mathrm{conv}}$)\n\nThe analysis begins with the provided steady-state, one-dimensional heat conduction equation in cylindrical coordinates:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{r}\\frac{d}{dr}\\!\\left(r\\,\\frac{d T}{dr}\\right) + \\frac{\\dot{q}'''}{k} = 0\n$$\nWe rearrange and integrate this ordinary differential equation with respect to the radial coordinate $r$:\n$$\n\\frac{d}{dr}\\!\\left(r\\,\\frac{d T}{dr}\\right) = -\\frac{\\dot{q}''' r}{k}\n$$\nIntegrating once yields:\n$$\nr\\,\\frac{dT}{dr} = -\\frac{\\dot{q}''' r^2}{2k} + C_1\n$$\nThe first boundary condition is that the temperature gradient must be finite at the centerline, $r=0$. From the expression $\\frac{dT}{dr} = -\\frac{\\dot{q}''' r}{2k} + \\frac{C_1}{r}$, this requires the integration constant $C_1$ to be zero. Thus, the temperature gradient at any radius $r$ is:\n$$\n\\frac{dT}{dr} = -\\frac{\\dot{q}''' r}{2k}\n$$\nAt the outer surface ($r=R$), the temperature gradient is:\n$$\n\\left.\\frac{dT}{dr}\\right|_{r=R} = -\\frac{\\dot{q}''' R}{2k}\n$$\nThe second boundary condition equates the conductive heat flux out of the cylinder at $r=R$ to the convective heat flux into the ambient fluid. This is stated as:\n$$\n-\\,k\\,\\left.\\frac{dT}{dr}\\right|_{r=R} = h\\,[T(R) - T_{\\infty}]\n$$\nSubstituting our result for the temperature gradient at $r=R$ into this boundary condition gives:\n$$\n-k \\left(-\\frac{\\dot{q}''' R}{2k}\\right) = h\\,[T_s - T_{\\infty}]\n$$\nwhere $T_s \\equiv T(R)$. The thermal conductivity $k$ cancels algebraically:\n$$\n\\frac{\\dot{q}''' R}{2} = h\\,(T_s - T_{\\infty})\n$$\nSolving for $\\dot{q}'''$ yields the first estimator, which we denote $\\dot{q}'''_{\\mathrm{conv}}$:\n$$\n\\dot{q}'''_{\\mathrm{conv}} = \\frac{2h\\,(T_s - T_{\\infty})}{R}\n$$\nThis estimator is independent of the thermal conductivity $k$ because the term $k$ in Fourier's law of conduction is exactly cancelled by the $1/k$ dependence of the surface temperature gradient that arises from integrating the heat equation.\n\nSecond Estimator: Based on Total Heat Loss Measurement ($\\dot{q}'''_{\\mathrm{loss}}$)\n\nThis estimator is derived from a macroscopic energy balance on the cylinder. For a control volume comprising a unit length of the cylinder, the principle of energy conservation at steady state dictates that the total rate of energy generation within the volume must equal the total rate of energy leaving the volume's surface.\nThe total energy generated per unit length is the volumetric generation rate multiplied by the volume per unit length, which is the cross-sectional area $A_c = \\pi R^2$.\n$$\n\\dot{Q}'_{\\text{generated}} = \\dot{q}''' \\cdot (\\pi R^2)\n$$\nThis must be equal to the measured total heat loss per unit length, $\\dot{Q}'$.\n$$\n\\dot{Q}'_{\\text{generated}} = \\dot{Q}'\n$$\nTherefore:\n$$\n\\dot{q}''' \\cdot (\\pi R^2) = \\dot{Q}'\n$$\nSolving for $\\dot{q}'''$ gives the second estimator, $\\dot{q}'''_{\\mathrm{loss}}$:\n$$\n\\dot{q}'''_{\\mathrm{loss}} = \\frac{\\dot{Q}'}{\\pi R^2}\n$$\nThis estimator is independent of $k$ because it is based on a global energy balance. The total heat generated must be removed, irrespective of the internal temperature distribution or the material's conductive properties, which only determine *how* the heat is conducted to the surface.\n\n**2. Uncertainty Propagation Analysis**\n\nWe use the a first-order Taylor series expansion (linear approximation) to propagate uncertainties. For a function $Y=f(X_1, X_2, \\dots, X_N)$, the combined standard uncertainty $u(y)$ is given by:\n$$\nu^2(y) \\approx \\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\left(\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x_i}\\right)^2 u^2(x_i)\n$$\nwhere $x_i$ are the estimates of the quantities $X_i$ and the partial derivatives are evaluated at these estimates.\n\nUncertainty in $\\dot{q}'''_{\\mathrm{conv}}$:\n\nThe estimator is $\\dot{q}'''_{\\mathrm{conv}} = \\frac{2h(T_s - T_{\\infty})}{R}$. Uncertainty is specified only for $h$, with standard uncertainty $u_h$.\n$$\nu^2(\\dot{q}'''_{\\mathrm{conv}}) = \\left(\\frac{\\partial \\dot{q}'''_{\\mathrm{conv}}}{\\partial h}\\right)^2 u_h^2\n$$\nThe required partial derivative is:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial \\dot{q}'''_{\\mathrm{conv}}}{\\partial h} = \\frac{2(T_s - T_{\\infty})}{R}\n$$\nSubstituting this into the uncertainty formula gives:\n$$\nu^2(\\dot{q}'''_{\\mathrm{conv}}) = \\left(\\frac{2(T_s - T_{\\infty})}{R}\\right)^2 u_h^2\n$$\nTaking the square root, the standard uncertainty is:\n$$\nu(\\dot{q}'''_{\\mathrm{conv}}) = \\frac{2(T_s - T_{\\infty})}{R} u_h\n$$\nThis can be expressed compactly in terms of relative uncertainty: $\\frac{u(\\dot{q}'''_{\\mathrm{conv}})}{\\dot{q}'''_{\\mathrm{conv}}} = \\frac{u_h}{h}$.\n\nUncertainty in $\\dot{q}'''_{\\mathrm{loss}}$:\n\nThe estimator is $\\dot{q}'''_{\\mathrm{loss}} = \\frac{\\dot{Q}'}{\\pi R^2}$. Uncertainty is specified only for $\\dot{Q}'$, with standard uncertainty $u_{\\dot{Q}'}$.\n$$\nu^2(\\dot{q}'''_{\\mathrm{loss}}) = \\left(\\frac{\\partial \\dot{q}'''_{\\mathrm{loss}}}{\\partial \\dot{Q}'}\\right)^2 u_{\\dot{Q}'}^2\n$$\nThe partial derivative is:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial \\dot{q}'''_{\\mathrm{loss}}}{\\partial \\dot{Q}'} = \\frac{1}{\\pi R^2}\n$$\nThus, the variance is:\n$$\nu^2(\\dot{q}'''_{\\mathrm{loss}}) = \\left(\\frac{1}{\\pi R^2}\\right)^2 u_{\\dot{Q}'}^2\n$$\nAnd the standard uncertainty is:\n$$\nu(\\dot{q}'''_{\\mathrm{loss}}) = \\frac{u_{\\dot{Q}'}}{\\pi R^2}\n$$\nIn terms of relative uncertainty: $\\frac{u(\\dot{q}'''_{\\mathrm{loss}})}{\\dot{q}'''_{\\mathrm{loss}}} = \\frac{u_{\\dot{Q}'}}{\\dot{Q}'}$.\n\n**3. Data Fusion and Consistency Diagnostic**\n\nWe must combine the two independent estimates, $x_1 = \\dot{q}'''_{\\mathrm{conv}}$ and $x_2 = \\dot{q}'''_{\\mathrm{loss}}$, into a single fused estimate with minimum variance. The estimates are assumed to be unbiased and their errors uncorrelated. Let their variances be $\\sigma_1^2 = u^2(\\dot{q}'''_{\\mathrm{conv}})$ and $\\sigma_2^2 = u^2(\\dot{q}'''_{\\mathrm{loss}})$.\n\nThe optimal fused estimate, $\\dot{q}'''_{\\mathrm{fused}}$, is the inverse-variance weighted average:\n$$\n\\dot{q}'''_{\\mathrm{fused}} = \\frac{x_1/\\sigma_1^2 + x_2/\\sigma_2^2}{1/\\sigma_1^2 + 1/\\sigma_2^2}\n$$\nThe variance of this fused estimate, $\\sigma_f^2 = u^2(\\dot{q}'''_{\\mathrm{fused}})$, is given by:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{\\sigma_f^2} = \\frac{1}{\\sigma_1^2} + \\frac{1}{\\sigma_2^2} \\implies \\sigma_f^2 = \\frac{\\sigma_1^2 \\sigma_2^2}{\\sigma_1^2 + \\sigma_2^2}\n$$\nThe fused standard uncertainty is therefore $u(\\dot{q}'''_{\\mathrm{fused}}) = \\sigma_f$.\n\nFor the consistency diagnostic, we compute the normalized difference between the two estimators, which follows a standard normal distribution under the null hypothesis that both estimators measure the same true value. This statistic, or $z$-score, is:\n$$\nz = \\frac{x_1 - x_2}{\\sqrt{\\sigma_1^2 + \\sigma_2^2}} = \\frac{\\dot{q}'''_{\\mathrm{conv}} - \\dot{q}'''_{\\mathrm{loss}}}{\\sqrt{u^2(\\dot{q}'''_{\\mathrm{conv}}) + u^2(\\dot{q}'''_{\\mathrm{loss}})}}\n$$\nThe two estimates are declared \"consistent\" if the magnitude of this statistic does not exceed $2$, i.e., $|z| \\leq 2$. This threshold corresponds to an approximate $95\\%$ confidence level.\n\nThese derived expressions are now implemented to process the provided test cases.", "answer": "```python\n# The complete and runnable Python 3 code goes here.\n# Imports must adhere to the specified execution environment.\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves the heat transfer problem for four test cases, calculating two independent\n    estimates of volumetric heat generation, their uncertainties, a fused estimate,\n    its uncertainty, and a consistency check.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Define the test cases from the problem statement.\n    # (R, T_inf, T_s, h, u_h, Q_prime, u_Q_prime) in SI units.\n    test_cases = [\n        # Case A\n        (0.01, 300, 350, 100, 5, 315, 10),\n        # Case B\n        (0.001, 293, 343, 200, 20, 60, 3),\n        # Case C\n        (0.05, 300, 320, 500, 100, 3200, 200),\n        # Case D\n        (0.02, 300, 330, 150, 5, 700, 10),\n    ]\n\n    all_results_str = []\n    \n    for case in test_cases:\n        R, T_inf, T_s, h, u_h, Q_prime, u_Q_prime = case\n        \n        # 1.
