It is well-posed, providing sufficient information and clear objectives for a unique solution to be derived. The language is objective and precise. The problem is a standard, canonical exercise in heat transfer analysis, specifically on the topic of critical radius of insulation for spherical geometries. Therefore, it does not violate any of the specified invalidity criteria.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is deemed **valid**. A solution will be provided.\n\nThe problem requires a derivation starting from first principles for the heat transfer rate, its maximization, and a comparative analysis.\n\nFirst, we derive the expression for the total heat transfer rate, $Q$. The process involves two thermal resistances in series: conduction through the spherical insulation and convection from the outer surface.\n\nThe thermal resistance for one-dimensional, steady-state conduction through a spherical shell is derived from Fourier's law:\n$$Q = -k A \\frac{dT}{dr}$$\nwhere $A(r) = 4\\pi r^{2}$ is the surface area of a sphere of radius $r$.\n$$Q = -k(4\\pi r^{2}) \\frac{dT}{dr}$$\nSeparating variables and integrating from the inner surface ($r=r_{i}$, $T=T_{i}$) to the outer surface ($r=r_{o}$, $T=T_{o}$):\n$$\\frac{Q}{4\\pi k} \\int_{r_{i}}^{r_{o}} \\frac{dr}{r^{2}} = -\\int_{T_{i}}^{T_{o}} dT$$\n$$\\frac{Q}{4\\pi k} \\left[ -\\frac{1}{r} \\right]_{r_{i}}^{r_{o}} = - (T_{o} - T_{i})$$\n$$\\frac{Q}{4\\pi k} \\left( \\frac{1}{r_{i}} - \\frac{1}{r_{o}} \\right) = T_{i} - T_{o}$$\nThe heat transfer through the conductive layer is thus $Q = \\frac{T_{i} - T_{o}}{R_{cond, sph}}$, where the spherical conduction resistance is:\n$$R_{cond, sph} = \\frac{1}{4\\pi k} \\left( \\frac{1}{r_{i}} - \\frac{1}{r_{o}} \\right)$$\nNext, from Newton's law of cooling, the heat transfer from the outer surface at $r=r_{o}$ to the ambient fluid is:\n$$Q = h A_{o} (T_{o} - T_{\\infty}) = h (4\\pi r_{o}^{2}) (T_{o} - T_{\\infty})$$\nThis can be written as $Q = \\frac{T_{o} - T_{\\infty}}{R_{conv}}$, where the convection resistance is:\n$$R_{conv} = \\frac{1}{h A_{o}} = \\frac{1}{4\\pi h r_{o}^{2}}$$\nFor resistances in series, the total heat transfer rate $Q$ is driven by the overall temperature difference $T_{i} - T_{\\infty}$ across the total thermal resistance $R_{total} = R_{cond, sph} + R_{conv}$.\n$$R_{total} = \\frac{1}{4\\pi k} \\left( \\frac{1}{r_{i}} - \\frac{1}{r_{o}} \\right) + \\frac{1}{4\\pi h r_{o}^{2}}$$\nThe expression for the total heat transfer rate $Q$ is therefore:\n$$Q = \\frac{T_{i} - T_{\\infty}}{R_{total}} = \\frac{T_{i} - T_{\\infty}}{\\frac{1}{4\\pi k} \\left( \\frac{1}{r_{i}} - \\frac{1}{r_{o}} \\right) + \\frac{1}{4\\pi h r_{o}^{2}}} = \\frac{4\\pi (T_{i} - T_{\\infty})}{\\frac{1}{k} \\left( \\frac{1}{r_{i}} - \\frac{1}{r_{o}} \\right) + \\frac{1}{h r_{o}^{2}}}$$\nThis completes the first task.\n\nTo determine if there exists a value of $r_{o}$ that maximizes $Q$, we must find the value of $r_{o}$ that minimizes the total resistance $R_{total}$. We find the extremum by setting the derivative of $R_{total}$ with respect to $r_{o}$ to zero. It is sufficient to minimize the denominator term, let us call it $D(r_{o}) = \\frac{R_{total}}{4\\pi}$.\n$$D(r_{o}) = \\frac{1}{k} \\left( \\frac{1}{r_{i}} - \\frac{1}{r_{o}} \\right) + \\frac{1}{h r_{o}^{2}}$$\n$$\\frac{dD}{dr_{o}} = \\frac{d}{dr_{o}} \\left( \\frac{1}{k r_{i}} - \\frac{1}{k r_{o}} + \\frac{1}{h r_{o}^{2}} \\right) = 0$$\n$$\\frac{1}{k r_{o}^{2}} - \\frac{2}{h r_{o}^{3}} = 0$$\nAssuming $r_{o} \\neq 0$, we multiply by $hkr_{o}^{3}$:\n$$h r_{o} - 2k = 0$$\nThis yields a critical radius, $r_{o, crit}$:\n$$r_{o, crit} = \\frac{2k}{h}$$\nTo verify this is a minimum for resistance (and thus a maximum for $Q$), we examine the second derivative:\n$$\\frac{d^{2}D}{dr_{o}^{2}} = \\frac{d}{dr_{o}} \\left( \\frac{1}{k} r_{o}^{-2} - \\frac{2}{h} r_{o}^{-3} \\right) = -\\frac{2}{k r_{o}^{3}} + \\frac{6}{h r_{o}^{4}}$$\nSubstituting $r_{o} = r_{o, crit} = \\frac{2k}{h}$:\n$$\\frac{d^{2}D}{dr_{o}^{2}} \\bigg|_{r_{o,crit}} = -\\frac{2}{k (\\frac{2k}{h})^{3}} + \\frac{6}{h (\\frac{2k}{h})^{4}} = -\\frac{2h^{3}}{8k^{4}} + \\frac{6h^{3}}{16k^{4}} = \\frac{-4h^{3} + 6h^{3}}{16k^{4}} = \\frac{2h^{3}}{16k^{4}} = \\frac{h^{3}}{8k^{4}}$$\nSince $h>0$ and $k>0$, the second derivative is positive. This confirms that $r_{o, crit} = \\frac{2k}{h}$ corresponds to a minimum in the total resistance, and therefore a maximum in the heat transfer rate, provided that this critical radius is physically achievable, i.e., $r_{o, crit} > r_{i}$. If $r_{o, crit} \\leq r_{i}$, then the resistance will continuously increase for any added insulation ($r_{o} > r_{i}$), and no maximum exists beyond $r_{i}$. This completes the second task.\n\nFor the third task, we compare the spherical result to the cylindrical case. For an insulated cylinder of length $L$, the total resistance is $R_{total, cyl} = \\frac{\\ln(r_{o}/r_{i})}{2\\pi k L} + \\frac{1}{2\\pi h L r_{o}}$. Minimizing this resistance yields a critical radius $r_{o, crit, cyl} = \\frac{k}{h}$.\nThe spherical critical radius, $r_{o, crit, sph} = \\frac{2k}{h}$, is exactly twice the cylindrical critical radius. This difference arises from the geometric scaling of surface area with radius. For a sphere, the surface area $A_{sph} = 4\\pi r^{2}$ grows quadratically with $r$. For a cylinder, the area per unit length $A'_{cyl} = 2\\pi r$ grows linearly with $r$. Adding insulation increases the conductive path length (increasing conduction resistance) but also increases the surface area for convection (decreasing convection resistance). For a sphere, the area increases more rapidly with $r$ than for a cylinder. Consequently, the beneficial effect of decreasing convective resistance (proportional to $1/r^{2}$) dominates over the detrimental effect of increasing conductive resistance (proportional to $1/r$) for a larger range of radii. The factor of $2$ in the formula originates from the derivative of the area-dependent convection resistance term: $\\frac{d}{dr}(1/r^{2}) = -2/r^{3}$ for the sphere, versus $\\frac{d}{dr}(1/r) = -1/r^{2}$ for the cylinder. This factor of $2$ propagates through the optimization calculation.\n\nFinally, for the fourth task, we calculate the numerical value of the critical radius for the specified case.\nGiven values are $r_{i} = 0.008\\ \\text{m}$, $k=0.08\\ \\text{W}\\ \\text{m}^{-1}\\ \\text{K}^{-1}$, and $h=10\\ \\text{W}\\ \\text{m}^{-2}\\ \\text{K}^{-1}$.\nThe critical outer radius is calculated using the derived formula:\n$$r_{o, crit} = \\frac{2k}{h} = \\frac{2 \\times (0.08\\ \\text{W}\\ \\text{m}^{-1}\\ \\text{K}^{-1})}{10\\ \\text{W}\\ \\text{m}^{-2}\\ \\text{K}^{-1}} = \\frac{0.16}{10}\\ \\text{m} = 0.016\\ \\text{m}$$\nWe must check if a maximum physically exists, i.e., if $r_{o, crit} > r_{i}$.\n$0.016\\ \\text{m} > 0.008\\ \\text{m}$. The condition is satisfied, so a maximum heat transfer rate does exist at this outer radius.\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures.\n$$r_{o, crit} = 0.01600\\ \\text{m}$$\nThe value required for the final answer is $0.01600$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{0.01600}\n$$", "id": "2470889"}, {"introduction": "When designing a composite system with multiple layers of different materials, a critical engineering question arises: does the order of the layers matter?

A rigorous solution will be developed.\n\nThe derivation begins from the fundamental equation for steady-state, one-dimensional heat conduction in spherical coordinates with no heat generation. This is the heat diffusion equation, which under these conditions simplifies based on conservation of energy:\n$$ \\frac{1}{r^2} \\frac{d}{dr} \\left( r^2 q_r(r) \\right) = 0 $$\nwhere $q_r$ is the radial heat flux. Integrating this equation yields $r^2 q_r(r) = C$, where $C$ is a constant. The total heat rate $Q$ through a spherical surface of radius $r$ is $Q = A q_r = (4\\pi r^2) q_r(r) = 4\\pi C$. This demonstrates that the total heat rate $Q$ is constant with respect to radius, a necessary condition for steady-state conduction in series without heat sources or sinks.\n\nFourier's law of conduction states:\n$$ q_r(r) = -k \\frac{dT}{dr} $$\nwhere $k$ is the thermal conductivity of the material at radius $r$.\n\nSubstituting $q_r = Q / (4\\pi r^2)$ into Fourier's law, we have:\n$$ \\frac{Q}{4\\pi r^2} = -k \\frac{dT}{dr} $$\nFor a single homogeneous layer of conductivity $k$ between radii $r_1$ and $r_2$ (with $r_1 < r_2$), we can separate variables and integrate from $r_1$ to $r_2$, corresponding to temperatures $T_1$ and $T_2$:\n$$ \\int_{T_1}^{T_2} dT = -\\frac{Q}{4\\pi k} \\int_{r_1}^{r_2} \\frac{dr}{r^2} $$\n$$ T_2 - T_1 = -\\frac{Q}{4\\pi k} \\left[ -\\frac{1}{r} \\right]_{r_1}^{r_2} = -\\frac{Q}{4\\pi k} \\left( -\\frac{1}{r_2} + \\frac{1}{r_1} \\right) $$\n$$ T_1 - T_2 = \\frac{Q}{4\\pi k} \\left( \\frac{1}{r_1} - \\frac{1}{r_2} \\right) $$\nThis equation is analogous to Ohm's law, $V=IR$, if we define the temperature difference $\\Delta T = T_1 - T_2$ as the potential, the heat rate $Q$ as the current, and the thermal resistance $R_{th}$ as:\n$$ R_{th} = \\frac{\\Delta T}{Q} = \\frac{1}{4\\pi k} \\left( \\frac{1}{r_1} - \\frac{1}{r_2} \\right) $$\nThis is the expression for the thermal resistance of a spherical shell.\n\nFor a composite system of layers in series, the total thermal resistance is the sum of the individual resistances.
