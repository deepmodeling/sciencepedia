It is a standard problem in the discipline of radiative heat transfer and contains all necessary information for a unique solution. Therefore, validation is passed and a solution will be derived.\n\nThe analysis begins from the fundamental principles of radiative heat transfer for diffuse-gray surfaces, as required. We consider a system of three surfaces: surface $1$ at temperature $T_1$ with emissivity $\\epsilon_1$, surface $2$ at temperature $T_2$ with emissivity $\\epsilon_2$, and a thin reradiating shield at a uniform temperature $T_s$ with emissivity $\\epsilon_s$ on both of its faces. The shield is placed between surfaces $1$ and $2$. Because the surfaces are very large and parallel, the view factor between any two opposing faces is unity. Let the face of the shield adjacent to surface $1$ be denoted $s_1$ and the face adjacent to surface $2$ be denoted $s_2$.\n\nThe defining characteristic of a reradiating surface is that the net heat transfer rate to it is zero. In this steady-state problem, this means that the net rate of radiative energy transfer from surface $1$ to the shield must equal the net rate of radiative energy transfer from the shield to surface $2$. Per unit area, this condition is expressed as:\n$$ q'_{1 \\to s} = q'_{s \\to 2} $$\nwhere $q'_{1 \\to s}$ is the net radiative flux from surface $1$ to the shield and $q'_{s \\to 2}$ is the net radiative flux from the shield to surface $2$.\n\nTo proceed, we must first derive a general expression for the net radiative flux per unit area, $q'_{ab}$, between two large, parallel, opaque, diffuse-gray surfaces 'a' and 'b'. The derivation starts from the definitions of radiosity ($J$) and irradiation ($G$). For any surface $i$, the radiosity is the sum of emitted and reflected radiation:\n$$ J_i = E_i + \\rho_i G_i $$\nwhere $E_i$ is the emissive power and $\\rho_i$ is the reflectivity. For a gray surface, emissivity $\\epsilon_i$ equals absorptivity $\\alpha_i$. For an opaque surface, $\\rho_i + \\alpha_i = 1$, so $\\rho_i = 1 - \\epsilon_i$. The emissive power is related to the blackbody emissive power $E_{bi} = \\sigma T_i^4$ by $E_i = \\epsilon_i E_{bi}$. Substituting these relations, the radiosity becomes:\n$$ J_i = \\epsilon_i E_{bi} + (1 - \\epsilon_i) G_i $$\nThe net radiative flux leaving surface $i$ is the difference between its radiosity and irradiation:\n$$ q'_{i, \\text{net}} = J_i - G_i $$\nRearranging the radiosity equation gives the net flux in terms of the surface potential difference $(E_{bi} - J_i)$:\n$$ q'_{i, \\text{net}} = J_i - \\frac{J_i - \\epsilon_i E_{bi}}{1 - \\epsilon_i} = \\frac{J_i(1 - \\epsilon_i) - J_i + \\epsilon_i E_{bi}}{1 - \\epsilon_i} = \\frac{\\epsilon_i}{1 - \\epsilon_i}(E_{bi} - J_i) $$\nFor our two-surface enclosure between 'a' and 'b', the geometry ($F_{ab}=1, F_{ba}=1$) dictates that all radiation leaving one surface is incident on the other. Thus, $G_a = J_b$ and $G_b = J_a$. The net flux exchanged between the surfaces is $q'_{ab} = J_a - G_a = J_a - J_b$.\nBy energy conservation, the net flux leaving surface 'a' must be equal to the net flux arriving at surface 'b', so $q'_{a, \\text{net}} = -q'_{b, \\text{net}} = q'_{ab}$.\nWe can now write two expressions for the net flux, one for each surface:\n$$ q'_{ab} = \\frac{\\epsilon_a}{1 - \\epsilon_a}(E_{ba} - J_a) \\implies J_a = E_{ba} - q'_{ab}\\frac{1 - \\epsilon_a}{\\epsilon_a} $$\n$$ -q'_{ab} = \\frac{\\epsilon_b}{1 - \\epsilon_b}(E_{bb} - J_b) \\implies J_b = E_{bb} + q'_{ab}\\frac{1 - \\epsilon_b}{\\epsilon_b} $$\nSubstitute these expressions for $J_a$ and $J_b$ into the net flux equation $q'_{ab} = J_a - J_b$:\n$$ q'_{ab} = \\left( E_{ba} - q'_{ab}\\frac{1 - \\epsilon_a}{\\epsilon_a} \\right) - \\left( E_{bb} + q'_{ab}\\frac{1 - \\epsilon_b}{\\epsilon_b} \\right) $$\n$$ q'_{ab} = E_{ba} - E_{bb} - q'_{ab} \\left( \\frac{1 - \\epsilon_a}{\\epsilon_a} + \\frac{1 - \\epsilon_b}{\\epsilon_b} \\right) $$\nSolving for $q'_{ab}$:\n$$ q'_{ab} \\left( 1 + \\frac{1}{\\epsilon_a} - 1 + \\frac{1}{\\epsilon_b} - 1 \\right) = E_{ba} - E_{bb} $$\n$$ q'_{ab} \\left( \\frac{1}{\\epsilon_a} + \\frac{1}{\\epsilon_b} - 1 \\right) = E_{ba} - E_{bb} $$\nFinally, substituting $E_{bi} = \\sigma T_i^4$, we obtain the desired general formula:\n$$ q'_{ab} = \\frac{\\sigma(T_a^4 - T_b^4)}{\\frac{1}{\\epsilon_a} + \\frac{1}{\\epsilon_b} - 1} $$\nNow we apply this result to the two gaps in our problem.\nFor the gap between surface $1$ and the shield (surface $s$):\n$$ q'_{1 \\to s} = \\frac{\\sigma(T_1^4 - T_s^4)}{\\frac{1}{\\epsilon_1} + \\frac{1}{\\epsilon_s} - 1} $$\nFor the gap between the shield (surface $s$) and surface $2$:\n$$ q'_{s \\to 2} = \\frac{\\sigma(T_s^4 - T_2^4)}{\\frac{1}{\\epsilon_s} + \\frac{1}{\\epsilon_2} - 1} $$\nInvoking the energy conservation condition for the reradiating shield, $q'_{1 \\to s} = q'_{s \\to 2}$:\n$$ \\frac{\\sigma(T_1^4 - T_s^4)}{\\frac{1}{\\epsilon_1} + \\frac{1}{\\epsilon_s} - 1} = \\frac{\\sigma(T_s^4 - T_2^4)}{\\frac{1}{\\epsilon_s} + \\frac{1}{\\epsilon_2} - 1} $$\nThe Stefan-Boltzmann constant $\\sigma$ cancels.

It is a standard, solvable problem in heat transfer that relies on fundamental principles. A full solution will be provided.\n\nThe analysis of radiative heat transfer between diffuse-gray surfaces is simplified by an analogy to electrical circuits. The net radiative heat flux, $q''$, between two surfaces is driven by the difference in their blackbody emissive powers, $E_b = \\sigma T^4$, and impeded by thermal resistances. For a surface $i$, the potential is its blackbody emissive power $E_{bi}$, and the current is the net heat rate $Q_i$. The net heat flux is $q''_i = Q_i/A_i$. We will work with resistances per unit area, denoted by $R''$.\n\nFor a diffuse-gray surface, the surface resistance to radiation per unit area is $R''_{surf} = \\frac{1 - \\epsilon}{\\epsilon}$.\nFor two large, parallel plates, the view factor $F_{12}$ is $1$. The space resistance to radiation per unit area between them is $R''_{space} = \\frac{1}{F_{12}} = 1$.\n\n**Case 1: Net Heat Flux without the Shield**\n\nThe system consists of two surfaces, $1$ and $2$. The total resistance to heat transfer is the sum of the two surface resistances and the space resistance between them.\nThe total resistance per unit area, $R''_{\\text{no shield}}$, is:\n$$R''_{\\text{no shield}} = R''_{surf,1} + R''_{space,12} + R''_{surf,2}$$\n$$R''_{\\text{no shield}} = \\left(\\frac{1 - \\epsilon_{1}}{\\epsilon_{1}}\\right) + 1 + \\left(\\frac{1 - \\epsilon_{2}}{\\epsilon_{2}}\\right)$$\nSimplifying this expression:\n$$R''_{\\text{no shield}} = \\frac{1}{\\epsilon_{1}} - 1 + 1 + \\frac{1}{\\epsilon_{2}} - 1 = \\frac{1}{\\epsilon_{1}} + \\frac{1}{\\epsilon_{2}} - 1$$\nThe net radiative heat flux from surface $1$ to surface $2$, $q''_{\\text{no shield}}$, is the potential difference divided by the total resistance:\n$$q''_{\\text{no shield}} = \\frac{E_{b1} - E_{b2}}{R''_{\\text{no shield}}} = \\frac{\\sigma(T_{1}^{4} - T_{2}^{4})}{\\frac{1}{\\epsilon_{1}} + \\frac{1}{\\epsilon_{2}} - 1}$$\n\n**Case 2: Net Heat Flux with the Shield**\n\nA thin, opaque, perfectly insulating shield (surface $s$) is placed between plates $1$ and $2$. The shield is at steady radiative equilibrium, which means the net heat flux to the shield is zero. Consequently, the heat flux from plate $1$ to the shield, $q''_{1s}$, must equal the heat flux from the shield to plate $2$, $q''_{s2}$. The overall heat flux with the shield, $q''_{\\text{with shield}}$, is equal to this value.\nThis configuration is equivalent to two separate radiation enclosures connected in series: one between surface $1$ and the shield, and another between the shield and surface $2$.

Let's substitute the given numerical values:\n$\\varepsilon_1 = 0.8$, so $1-\\varepsilon_1 = 0.2$.\n$\\varepsilon_3 = 0.6$, so $1-\\varepsilon_3 = 0.4$.\n$T_1 = 1200\\,\\mathrm{K}$, $T_3 = 600\\,\\mathrm{K}$.\n$\\sigma = 5.670374419 \\times 10^{-8}\\,\\mathrm{W\\,m^{-2}\\,K^{-4}}$.\n\nView factors:\n$F_{11}=0$, $F_{12}=0.3$, $F_{13}=0.7$.\n$F_{21}=0.6$, $F_{22}=0$, $F_{23}=0.4$.\n$F_{31}=\\frac{7}{15}$, $F_{32}=\\frac{2}{15}$, $F_{33}=\\frac{2}{5}=0.4$.\n\nThe right-hand sides (RHS) of the equations are:\nRHS$_1 = \\varepsilon_1 \\sigma T_1^4 = 0.8 \\times (5.670374419 \\times 10^{-8}) \\times (1200)^4 \\approx 94053.86\\,\\mathrm{W\\,m^{-2}}$.\nRHS$_2 = 0$.\nRHS$_3 = \\varepsilon_3 \\sigma T_3^4 = 0.6 \\times (5.670374419 \\times 10^{-8}) \\times (600)^4 \\approx 4408.77\\,\\mathrm{W\\,m^{-2}}$.\n\nThe coefficients for the linear system are:\nEquation 1:\n$[1 - (0.2)(0)]J_1 - (0.2)(0.3)J_2 - (0.2)(0.7)J_3 = 94053.86$\n$1 J_1 - 0.06 J_2 - 0.14 J_3 = 94053.86$\n\nEquation 2:\n$-0.6 J_1 + (1 - 0)J_2 - 0.4 J_3 = 0$\n$-0.6 J_1 + 1 J_2 - 0.4 J_3 = 0$\n\nEquation 3:\n$-(0.4)(\\frac{7}{15})J_1 - (0.4)(\\frac{2}{15})J_2 + [1 - (0.4)(0.4)]J_3 = 4408.77$\n$-\\frac{2.8}{15}J_1 - \\frac{0.8}{15}J_2 + (1 - 0.16)J_3 = 4408.77$\n$-0.186\\overline{6} J_1 - 0.053\\overline{3} J_2 + 0.84 J_3 = 4408.77$\n\nThe system of equations in matrix form is:\n$$\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n1 & -0.06 & -0.14 \\\\\n-0.6 & 1 & -0.4 \\\\\n-0.186\\overline{6} & -0.053\\overline{3} & 0.84\n\\end{pmatrix}\n\\begin{pmatrix}\nJ_1 \\\\\nJ_2 \\\\\nJ_3\n\\end{pmatrix}\n=\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n94053.86 \\\\\n0 \\\\\n4408.77\n\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nSolving this system of linear equations yields the values for the radiosities. While the entire system can be solved, our objective is to find $T_2$, which only requires the value of $J_2$.
