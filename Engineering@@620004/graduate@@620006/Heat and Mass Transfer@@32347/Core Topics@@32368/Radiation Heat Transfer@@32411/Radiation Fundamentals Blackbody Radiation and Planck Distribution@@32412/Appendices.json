We use the Taylor series expansion for the exponential function, $\\exp(z) = 1 + z + \\frac{z^2}{2!} + \\dots$, and for small $z$, we approximate $\\exp(z) \\approx 1 + z$. Substituting $z = \\frac{h c}{\\lambda k_B T}$ into the denominator of Planck's law gives:\n$$ \\exp\\left(\\frac{h c}{\\lambda k_B T}\\right) - 1 \\approx \\left(1 + \\frac{h c}{\\lambda k_B T}\\right) - 1 = \\frac{h c}{\\lambda k_B T} $$\nSubstituting this approximation back into the expression for $L_{\\lambda,b}$ yields the Rayleigh-Jeans spectral radiance, $L_{\\lambda,b,\\mathrm{RJ}}$:\n$$ L_{\\lambda,b,\\mathrm{RJ}}(\\lambda, T) = \\frac{2 h c^2}{\\lambda^5 \\left(\\frac{h c}{\\lambda k_B T}\\right)} = \\frac{2 c k_B T}{\\lambda^4} $$\nThe pyrometer measures the true radiance from the surface, which is given by Planck's law at the true temperature $T_0$ and the specific wavelength $\\lambda_0$.

The aperture radiates as a blackbody at the temperature $T$ of the cavity. The Planck spectral radiance, $B_{\\lambda}(T)$, gives the power emitted per unit projected area, per unit solid angle, per unit wavelength. Assuming the standard physics definition for this term, it is the spectral intensity $I_{\\lambda,b}(T)$:\n$$I_{\\lambda,b}(T) = \\frac{2 h c^2}{\\lambda^5 \\left(\\exp\\left(\\frac{h c}{\\lambda k_B T}\\right) - 1\\right)}$$\nwhere $h$ is Planck's constant, $c$ is the speed of light in vacuum, $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant, and $\\lambda$ is the wavelength.\n\nThe power per unit area per unit wavelength, known as the spectral hemispherical emissive power $E_{\\lambda,b}(T)$, is found by integrating the radiance over the entire hemisphere of outward directions. For a diffuse surface, $I_{\\lambda,b}(T)$ is independent of direction.\n$$E_{\\lambda,b}(T) = \\int_{hemisphere} I_{\\lambda,b}(T) \\cos\\theta \\, d\\Omega$$\nThe differential solid angle in spherical coordinates is $d\\Omega = \\sin\\theta \\, d\\theta \\, d\\phi$. The integration is over the azimuthal angle $\\phi$ from $0$ to $2\\pi$ and the polar angle $\\theta$ from $0$ to $\\pi/2$.\n$$E_{\\lambda,b}(T) = I_{\\lambda,b}(T) \\int_{0}^{2\\pi} d\\phi \\int_{0}^{\\pi/2} \\cos\\theta \\sin\\theta \\, d\\theta = I_{\\lambda,b}(T) (2\\pi) \\left[\\frac{\\sin^2\\theta}{2}\\right]_{0}^{\\pi/2} = I_{\\lambda,b}(T) (2\\pi) \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) = \\pi I_{\\lambda,b}(T)$$\nThus, the spectral emissive power is:\n$$E_{\\lambda,b}(T) = \\frac{2\\pi h c^2}{\\lambda^5 \\left(\\exp\\left(\\frac{h c}{\\lambda k_B T}\\right) - 1\\right)}$$\n\nThe total hemispherical emissive power, $E_b(T)$, is obtained by integrating $E_{\\lambda,b}(T)$ over all wavelengths from $0$ to $\\infty$.\n$$E_b(T) = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} E_{\\lambda,b}(T) \\, d\\lambda = 2\\pi h c^2 \\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{\\lambda^5 \\left(\\exp\\left(\\frac{h c}{\\lambda k_B T}\\right) - 1\\right)} \\, d\\lambda$$\nTo solve this integral, we perform a substitution. Let $x = \\frac{hc}{\\lambda k_B T}$. This implies $\\lambda = \\frac{hc}{x k_B T}$ and $d\\lambda = -\\frac{hc}{x^2 k_B T} dx$. The integration limits change: as $\\lambda \\to 0$, $x \\to \\infty$; as $\\lambda \\to \\infty$, $x \\to 0$.\n$$E_b(T) = 2\\pi h c^2 \\int_{\\infty}^{0} \\frac{1}{\\left(\\frac{hc}{x k_B T}\\right)^5 (\\exp(x) - 1)} \\left(-\\frac{hc}{x^2 k_B T}\\right) dx$$\nReversing the limits and simplifying the expression:\n$$E_b(T) = 2\\pi h c^2 \\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\frac{x^5 (k_B T)^5}{(hc)^5 (\\exp(x) - 1)} \\frac{hc}{x^2 k_B T} dx$$\n$$E_b(T) = 2\\pi h c^2 \\frac{(k_B T)^4}{(hc)^4} \\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\frac{x^3}{\\exp(x) - 1} dx = \\frac{2\\pi (k_B T)^4}{h^3 c^2} \\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\frac{x^3}{\\exp(x) - 1} dx$$\nThe definite integral is a standard form related to the Bose-Einstein integral and the Riemann zeta function, with value $\\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\frac{x^3}{\\exp(x) - 1} dx = \\frac{\\pi^4}{15}$.\nSubstituting this value, we obtain the Stefan-Boltzmann law for blackbody emissive power:\n$$E_b(T) = \\frac{2\\pi (k_B T)^4}{h^3 c^2} \\frac{\\pi^4}{15} = \\left(\\frac{2 \\pi^5 k_B^4}{15 h^3 c^2}\\right) T^4 = \\sigma T^4$$\nwhere $\\sigma = \\frac{2 \\pi^5 k_B^4}{15 h^3 c^2}$ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.\nThe total power radiated outward from the aperture of area $A$ is $P_{out} = A E_b(T) = A \\sigma T^4$.\n\nNext, we derive the expression for the inward power, $P_{in}$. This is the power incident on the aperture from the exterior environment, which is then absorbed since the aperture is black. The incident power is $P_{in} = A G$, where $G$ is the total hemispherical irradiation.\nThe irradiation $G$ is the integral of the incoming spectral radiance, $I_{\\lambda,in}$, over the hemisphere of incident directions and all wavelengths.\n$$G = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\int_{hemisphere} I_{\\lambda,in}(\\lambda, \\theta, \\phi) \\cos\\theta \\, d\\Omega \\, d\\lambda$$\nThe exterior consists of two sources: the cold surface at temperature $T_c$ subtending a region of the hemisphere defined by view factor $F$, and the rest of the hemisphere, which is deep space at $0$ K. The radiance from a blackbody at temperature $T'$ is $I_{\\lambda,b}(T')$. Thus, $I_{\\lambda,in} = I_{\\lambda,b}(T_c)$ for directions toward the cold surface and $I_{\\lambda,in} = I_{\\lambda,b}(0) = 0$ for all other directions.\n$$G = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\left( \\int_{\\Omega_c} I_{\\lambda,b}(T_c) \\cos\\theta \\, d\\Omega + \\int_{\\Omega_{space}} I_{\\lambda,b}(0) \\cos\\theta \\, d\\Omega \\right) d\\lambda$$\nThe second term in the parentheses is zero. Since the cold surface is isothermal, $I_{\\lambda,b}(T_c)$ is uniform and can be taken out of the angular integral.\n$$G = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} I_{\\lambda,b}(T_c) \\left( \\int_{\\Omega_c} \\cos\\theta \\, d\\Omega \\right) d\\lambda$$\nThe view factor $F$ from a diffuse surface element to a finite surface is defined as $F = \\frac{1}{\\pi} \\int_{\\Omega_c} \\cos\\theta \\, d\\Omega$. Therefore, the angular integral is $\\int_{\\Omega_c} \\cos\\theta \\, d\\Omega = \\pi F$.\nSubstituting this into the expression for $G$:\n$$G = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} I_{\\lambda,b}(T_c) (\\pi F) \\, d\\lambda = F \\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\pi I_{\\lambda,b}(T_c) \\, d\\lambda$$\nThe integral $\\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\pi I_{\\lambda,b}(T_c) \\, d\\lambda$ is precisely the total emissive power of a blackbody at temperature $T_c$, which we have shown to be $E_b(T_c) = \\sigma T_c^4$.\nThus, the irradiation on the aperture is $G = F \\sigma T_c^4$.\nThe total power absorbed by the aperture is $P_{in} = A G = A F \\sigma T_c^4$.\n\nFinally, the net outward power $P$ is calculated as the difference between outward and inward power.\n$$P = P_{out} - P_{in} = A \\sigma T^4 - A F \\sigma T_c^4 = A \\sigma (T^4 - F T_c^4)$$\nSubstituting the expression for the Stefan-Boltzmann constant $\\sigma$ in terms of fundamental constants:\n$$P = A \\left(\\frac{2 \\pi^5 k_B^4}{15 h^3 c^2}\\right) (T^4 - F T_c^4)$$\nThis is the final closed-form analytical expression for the net outward radiative power, derived from first principles as required.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{A \\left(\\frac{2 \\pi^5 k_B^4}{15 h^3 c^2}\\right) (T^4 - F T_c^4)}\n$$", "id": "2517467"}]}
