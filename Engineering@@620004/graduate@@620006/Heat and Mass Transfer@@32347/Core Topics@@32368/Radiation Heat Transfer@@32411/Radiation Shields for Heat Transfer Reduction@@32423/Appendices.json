A rigorous derivation and solution will be provided.\n\n**Derivation from Fundamentals**\n\nThe analysis will be conducted on a per-unit-area basis. The net radiative heat flux, $q''$, is constant throughout the system at steady state. We begin by defining the relationship between a surface's properties and the radiation fluxes.\n\nFor any opaque, diffuse-gray surface $i$, the net radiative heat flux leaving the surface is the difference between its radiosity, $J_i$, and its irradiation, $G_i$:\n$$q''_i = J_i - G_i$$\nThe radiosity is the total radiation leaving the surface, comprising emitted and reflected components:\n$$J_i = E_i + \\rho_i G_i$$\nwhere $E_i = \\varepsilon_i E_{bi}$ is the emissive power of the surface, $E_{bi} = \\sigma T_i^4$ is the blackbody emissive power, $\\varepsilon_i$ is the emissivity, and $\\rho_i$ is the reflectivity. For a gray surface, emissivity equals absorptivity ($\\varepsilon_i = \\alpha_i$). For an opaque surface, $\\alpha_i + \\rho_i = 1$, which implies $\\rho_i = 1 - \\varepsilon_i$.\nSubstituting $\\rho_i$ into the radiosity equation:\n$$J_i = \\varepsilon_i E_{bi} + (1 - \\varepsilon_i) G_i$$\nWe can express $G_i$ from the net flux equation as $G_i = J_i - q''_i$. Substituting this into the radiosity equation:\n$$J_i = \\varepsilon_i E_{bi} + (1 - \\varepsilon_i) (J_i - q''_i)$$\n$$J_i = \\varepsilon_i E_{bi} + J_i - q''_i - \\varepsilon_i J_i + \\varepsilon_i q''_i$$\n$$\\varepsilon_i J_i = \\varepsilon_i E_{bi} - q''_i (1 - \\varepsilon_i)$$\n$$J_i = E_{bi} - q''_i \\frac{1 - \\varepsilon_i}{\\varepsilon_i}$$\nThis can be rearranged to express the net flux $q''_i$ in terms of a potential difference $(E_{bi} - J_i)$ and a surface resistance per unit area, $R''_i = (1-\\varepsilon_i)/\\varepsilon_i$:\n$$q''_i = \\frac{E_{bi} - J_i}{(1-\\varepsilon_i)/\\varepsilon_i}$$\nFor two very large, parallel plates (surfaces $i$ and $j$), the view factor $F_{ij} = 1$. The net heat flux exchanged between them is given by the difference in their radiosities:\n$$q''_{ij} = J_i - J_j$$\nThis can be viewed as the flux across a space resistance per unit area, $R''_{ij} = 1/F_{ij} = 1$.\n\nWe can apply this framework to an enclosure formed by two large, parallel, diffuse-gray plates, 1 and 2. The net heat flux, $q''$, is constant.\n$$q'' = \\frac{E_{b1} - J_1}{(1-\\varepsilon_1)/\\varepsilon_1} \\implies J_1 = E_{b1} - q'' \\frac{1-\\varepsilon_1}{\\varepsilon_1}$$\n$$q'' = \\frac{J_2 - E_{b2}}{(1-\\varepsilon_2)/\\varepsilon_2} \\implies J_2 = E_{b2} + q'' \\frac{1-\\varepsilon_2}{\\varepsilon_2}$$\n$$q'' = J_1 - J_2$$\nSubstituting the expressions for $J_1$ and $J_2$ into the third equation:\n$$q'' = \\left(E_{b1} - q'' \\frac{1-\\varepsilon_1}{\\varepsilon_1}\\right) - \\left(E_{b2} + q'' \\frac{1-\\varepsilon_2}{\\varepsilon_2}\\right)$$\n$$q'' = (E_{b1} - E_{b2}) - q''\\left(\\frac{1-\\varepsilon_1}{\\varepsilon_1} + \\frac{1-\\varepsilon_2}{\\varepsilon_2}\\right)$$\n$$q''\\left(1 + \\frac{1-\\varepsilon_1}{\\varepsilon_1} + \\frac{1-\\varepsilon_2}{\\varepsilon_2}\\right) = E_{b1} - E_{b2}$$\n$$q''\\left(\\frac{1}{\\varepsilon_1} + \\frac{1}{\\varepsilon_2} - 1\\right) = \\sigma(T_1^4 - T_2^4)$$\nThus, the heat flux between two parallel plates is:\n$$q'' = \\frac{\\sigma(T_1^4 - T_2^4)}{\\frac{1}{\\varepsilon_1} + \\frac{1}{\\varepsilon_2} - 1}$$\nThis result, derived from fundamentals, can be applied to the problem with the shield. The system with one shield can be modeled as two enclosures in series: one between plate 1 and the shield (s), and another between the shield and plate 2. The shield is in radiative equilibrium, meaning the heat flux it receives from plate 1 is equal to the heat flux it emits to plate 2. Let the shield temperature be $T_s$. The net heat flux $q''$ is uniform throughout.\n\nFor the enclosure between plate 1 and the shield:\n$$q'' = \\frac{\\sigma(T_1^4 - T_s^4)}{\\frac{1}{\\varepsilon_1} + \\frac{1}{\\varepsilon_s} - 1}$$\nFor the enclosure between the shield and plate 2:\n$$q'' = \\frac{\\sigma(T_s^4 - T_2^4)}{\\frac{1}{\\varepsilon_s} + \\frac{1}{\\varepsilon_2} - 1}$$\nWe can solve for $\\sigma T_s^4$ from both equations:\n$$\\sigma T_s^4 = \\sigma T_1^4 - q''\\left(\\frac{1}{\\varepsilon_1} + \\frac{1}{\\varepsilon_s} - 1\\right)$$\n$$\\sigma T_s^4 = \\sigma T_2^4 + q''\\left(\\frac{1}{\\varepsilon_s} + \\frac{1}{\\varepsilon_2} - 1\\right)$$\nEquating these two expressions:\n$$\\sigma T_1^4 - q''\\left(\\frac{1}{\\varepsilon_1} + \\frac{1}{\\varepsilon_s} - 1\\right) = \\sigma T_2^4 + q''\\left(\\frac{1}{\\varepsilon_s} + \\frac{1}{\\varepsilon_2} - 1\\right)$$\n$$\\sigma(T_1^4 - T_2^4) = q''\\left[\\left(\\frac{1}{\\varepsilon_1} + \\frac{1}{\\varepsilon_s} - 1\\right) + \\left(\\frac{1}{\\varepsilon_s} + \\frac{1}{\\varepsilon_2} - 1\\right)\\right]$$\n$$\\sigma(T_1^4 - T_2^4) = q''\\left(\\frac{1}{\\varepsilon_1} + \\frac{2}{\\varepsilon_s} + \\frac{1}{\\varepsilon_2} - 2\\right)$$\nSolving for the net heat flux per unit area, $q''$:\n$$q'' = \\frac{\\sigma(T_1^4 - T_2^4)}{\\frac{1}{\\varepsilon_1} + \\frac{2}{\\varepsilon_s} + \\frac{1}{\\varepsilon_2} - 2}$$\nThis is the required expression derived from fundamental principles as requested.\n\n**Numerical Evaluation**\n\nWe substitute the given values into the derived expression:\n-   $T_1 = 1000\\ \\mathrm{K}$\n-   $T_2 = 300\\ \\mathrm{K}$\n-   $\\varepsilon_1 = 0.85$\n-   $\\varepsilon_2 = 0.60$\n-   $\\varepsilon_s = 0.10$\n-   $\\sigma = 5.670374419 \\times 10^{-8}\\ \\mathrm{W}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-2}\\,\\mathrm{K}^{-4}$\n\nFirst, calculate the denominator, which is the total thermal resistance per unit area:\n$$R''_{total} = \\frac{1}{\\varepsilon_1} + \\frac{2}{\\varepsilon_s} + \\frac{1}{\\varepsilon_2} - 2 = \\frac{1}{0.85} + \\frac{2}{0.10} + \\frac{1}{0.60} - 2$$\n$$R''_{total} \\approx 1.176470588 + 20 + 1.666666667 - 2 = 20.843137255$$\nNext, calculate the numerator:\n$$ \\sigma(T_1^4 - T_2^4) = (5.670374419 \\times 10^{-8})\\left( (1000)^4 - (300)^4 \\right) $$\n$$ \\sigma(T_1^4 - T_2^4) = (5.670374419 \\times 10^{-8})\\left( 1 \\times 10^{12} - 8.1 \\times 10^9 \\right) $$\n$$ \\sigma(T_1^4 - T_2^4) = (5.670374419 \\times 10^{-8})(9.919 \\times 10^{11}) \\approx 56243.218\\ \\mathrm{W}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-2} $$\nNow, compute the heat flux $q''$:\n$$q'' = \\frac{56243.218}{20.843137255} \\approx 2698.391\\ \\mathrm{W}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-2}$$\nThe problem requires the answer in $\\mathrm{kW}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-2}$, rounded to four significant figures.\n$$q'' \\approx 2.698391\\ \\mathrm{kW}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-2}$$\nRounding to four significant figures gives:\n$$q'' \\approx 2.698\\ \\mathrm{kW}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-2}$$\nThis concludes the solution.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{2.698}$$", "id": "2518022"}, {"introduction": "Building upon the single-shield case, this practice challenges you to generalize the analysis to a system with multiple, non-identical shields.

All plates are large, parallel, gray, diffuse, opaque, and isothermal. The derivation must proceed from fundamental principles without explicitly solving for the temperatures of the intermediate shields.\n\nLet the stack consist of $N+2$ plates, indexed from $i=0$ for the hot plate to $i=N+1$ for the cold plate. The hot plate is at a known absolute temperature $T_0 = T_\\mathrm{h}$, and the cold plate is at a known absolute temperature $T_{N+1} = T_\\mathrm{c}$. The plates are separated by vacuum, so heat transfer occurs solely by radiation. The emissivity of plate $i$ is denoted by $\\varepsilon_i$.\n\nFirst, we must derive the expression for the net radiative heat flux, $q_{i \\to i+1}''$, across the gap between any two adjacent parallel plates, $i$ and $i+1$. The fundamental relations for a gray, diffuse, opaque surface are given. The radiosity $J_i$ of surface $i$ is the total radiation leaving it, and the irradiation $G_i$ is the total radiation incident upon it. The net radiative heat flux leaving surface $i$ is $q_i''=J_i-G_i$. The radiosity is related to the emissive power $E_{b,i}$ and the irradiation by:\n$$J_i = \\varepsilon_i E_{b,i} + (1 - \\varepsilon_i) G_i$$\nwhere $E_{b,i} = \\sigma T_i^4$ is the blackbody emissive power according to the Stefan-Boltzmann law, with $\\sigma$ being the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.\n\nFor two large, parallel plates $i$ and $i+1$, the view factor between them is unity, $F_{i, i+1} = 1$. This means all radiation leaving plate $i$ is intercepted by plate $i+1$, and vice versa. Therefore, the irradiation on surface $i$ is equal to the radiosity of surface $i+1$, so $G_i = J_{i+1}$. Similarly, $G_{i+1} = J_i$.\nThe radiosity equations for the facing surfaces of plates $i$ and $i+1$ become:\n$$J_i = \\varepsilon_i E_{b,i} + (1 - \\varepsilon_i) J_{i+1} \\quad (1)$$\n$$J_{i+1} = \\varepsilon_{i+1} E_{b,i+1} + (1 - \\varepsilon_{i+1}) J_i \\quad (2)$$\n\nThe net rate of heat transfer per unit area from plate $i$ to plate $i+1$, denoted as $q''$, is the radiation leaving $i$ that is absorbed by $i+1$ minus the radiation leaving $i+1$ that is absorbed by $i$. More simply, it is the net flow of energy across the gap, which is the total radiation leaving $i$ towards $i+1$ minus the total radiation leaving $i+1$ towards $i$. This is $q'' = J_i - J_{i+1}$ because $G_{i+1} = J_i$.\n\nWe can solve the system of linear equations for $J_i$ and $J_{i+1}$. From equation (1), we have:\n$$J_i - (1 - \\varepsilon_i) J_{i+1} = \\varepsilon_i E_{b,i}$$\nFrom equation (2), we have:\n$$-(1 - \\varepsilon_{i+1}) J_i + J_{i+1} = \\varepsilon_{i+1} E_{b,i+1}$$\nTo find $q''=J_i-J_{i+1}$, we can rearrange Eq. (1) as $J_i - J_{i+1} = \\varepsilon_i E_{b,i} - \\varepsilon_i J_{i+1}$ and Eq. (2) as $J_i - J_{i+1} = \\frac{1}{1-\\varepsilon_{i+1}} \\varepsilon_{i+1} E_{b,i+1} - \\frac{\\varepsilon_{i+1}}{1-\\varepsilon_{i+1}} J_{i+1}$. This path is complicated.\nA more direct method is to use the concept of thermal resistance. The net heat flux leaving surface $i$ is $q'' = \\frac{E_{b,i} - J_i}{(1-\\varepsilon_i)/\\varepsilon_i}$, and the net flux between surfaces is $q'' = \\frac{J_i - J_{i+1}}{1/F_{i,i+1}} = J_i - J_{i+1}$. The net flux absorbed by surface $i+1$ is $q'' = \\frac{J_{i+1} - E_{b,i+1}}{(1-\\varepsilon_{i+1})/\\varepsilon_{i+1}}$. Summing potentials:\n$E_{b,i} - E_{b,i+1} = (E_{b,i}-J_i) + (J_i-J_{i+1}) + (J_{i+1}-E_{b,i+1}) = q''\\frac{1-\\varepsilon_i}{\\varepsilon_i} + q''\\frac{1}{1} + q''\\frac{1-\\varepsilon_{i+1}}{\\varepsilon_{i+1}}$.\n$E_{b,i} - E_{b,i+1} = q'' \\left(\\frac{1-\\varepsilon_i}{\\varepsilon_i} + 1 + \\frac{1-\\varepsilon_{i+1}}{\\varepsilon_{i+1}}\\right) = q'' \\left(\\frac{1}{\\varepsilon_i} - 1 + 1 + \\frac{1}{\\varepsilon_{i+1}} - 1\\right) = q'' \\left(\\frac{1}{\\varepsilon_i} + \\frac{1}{\\varepsilon_{i+1}} - 1\\right)$.\nThus, the net heat flux across the gap between plates $i$ and $i+1$ is:\n$$q'' = \\frac{E_{b,i} - E_{b,i+1}}{\\frac{1}{\\varepsilon_i} + \\frac{1}{\\varepsilon_{i+1}} - 1} = \\frac{\\sigma (T_i^4 - T_{i+1}^4)}{\\frac{1}{\\varepsilon_i} + \\frac{1}{\\varepsilon_{i+1}} - 1} \\quad (3)$$\n\nAt steady state, the heat flux $q''$ must be constant through each of the $N+1$ gaps in the stack. The radiation shields are thermally floating, meaning there is no net energy input or removal from them, so the heat they absorb from the hotter side is entirely re-radiated to the colder side.\nWe can write Eq. (3) for each gap, from $i=0$ to $i=N$:\n$$q'' \\left(\\frac{1}{\\varepsilon_i} + \\frac{1}{\\varepsilon_{i+1}} - 1\\right) = \\sigma (T_i^4 - T_{i+1}^4)$$\nThis gives us a system of $N+1$ equations:\nFor gap $0$ (between plate $0$ and $1$): $q'' \\left( \\frac{1}{\\varepsilon_0} + \\frac{1}{\\varepsilon_1} - 1 \\right) = \\sigma (T_0^4 - T_1^4)$\nFor gap $1$ (between plate $1$ and $2$): $q'' \\left( \\frac{1}{\\varepsilon_1} + \\frac{1}{\\varepsilon_2} - 1 \\right) = \\sigma (T_1^4 - T_2^4)$\n...\nFor gap $N$ (between plate $N$ and $N+1$): $q'' \\left( \\frac{1}{\\varepsilon_N} + \\frac{1}{\\varepsilon_{N+1}} - 1 \\right) = \\sigma (T_N^4 - T_{N+1}^4)$\n\nTo find $q''$ without solving for the intermediate shield temperatures $T_1, T_2, \\dots, T_N$, we sum these $N+1$ equations.

Then, using first-order uncertainty propagation (Gaussian law of propagation of uncertainty) for uncorrelated inputs, compute the combined standard uncertainty of the net radiative heat flux per unit area. Express your final uncertainty in $\\mathrm{W\\,m^{-2}}$ and round your answer to three significant figures.", "solution": "The problem presented is a standard exercise in heat transfer and metrology. It is well-posed, scientifically sound, and contains all necessary information for a unique solution. We shall proceed with the derivation and calculation.\n\nThe problem requires the derivation of the net radiative heat flux per unit area, $q''$, starting from fundamental relations for diffuse-gray surfaces. The system consists of two large, parallel, diffuse-gray plates (surfaces $1$ and $2$) with a single, thin, opaque, diffuse-gray radiation shield (surface $s$) placed between them. The analysis is conveniently performed using the concept of a thermal resistance network, which is a direct consequence of the radiosity-irradiation relations for an enclosure of diffuse-gray surfaces.\n\nFor a diffuse-gray surface $i$, the radiosity $J_i$ is the sum of emitted and reflected radiation: $J_i = E_i + \\rho_i G_i$. The net heat flux from the surface is $q''_i = J_i - G_i$. Using the definitions of emissivity $\\varepsilon_i = E_i/E_{bi}$ (where $E_{bi} = \\sigma T_i^4$ is the blackbody emissive power) and Kirchoff's law ($\\alpha_i = \\varepsilon_i$, so reflectivity is $\\rho_i=1-\\varepsilon_i$), we can write the net heat flux leaving a surface as $q''_i = \\frac{E_{bi} - J_i}{(1-\\varepsilon_i)/\\varepsilon_i}$. This defines the surface resistance per unit area as $R''_s = (1-\\varepsilon)/\\varepsilon$.\n\nThe heat flux between two surfaces $i$ and $j$ is given by $q''_{ij} = J_i - J_j$ for a view factor $F_{ij}=1$, which is the case for large parallel planes. This defines the space resistance per unit area as $R''_{space} = 1/F_{ij} = 1$.\n\nThe system can be modeled as a series of thermal resistances between the potentials $E_{b1} = \\sigma T_1^4$ and $E_{b2} = \\sigma T_2^4$. The shield is treated as a floating potential node, $E_{bs} = \\sigma T_s^4$, where $T_s$ is the shield temperature. The total heat flux $q''$ flows from plate $1$ to the shield, and then from the shield to plate $2$.\n\nThe total resistance between plate $1$ and the shield is the sum of the surface resistance of plate $1$, the space resistance between plate $1$ and the shield, and the surface resistance of the shield's face towards plate $1$.\n$$ R''_{1-s} = \\frac{1-\\varepsilon_1}{\\varepsilon_1} + \\frac{1}{F_{1s}} + \\frac{1-\\varepsilon_s}{\\varepsilon_s} $$\nWith $F_{1s}=1$, this simplifies to:\n$$ R''_{1-s} = \\frac{1}{\\varepsilon_1} - 1 + 1 + \\frac{1}{\\varepsilon_s} - 1 = \\frac{1}{\\varepsilon_1} + \\frac{1}{\\varepsilon_s} - 1 $$\nSimilarly, the total resistance between the shield and plate $2$ is:\n$$ R''_{s-2} = \\frac{1-\\varepsilon_s}{\\varepsilon_s} + \\frac{1}{F_{s2}} + \\frac{1-\\varepsilon_2}{\\varepsilon_2} = \\frac{1}{\\varepsilon_s} + \\frac{1}{\\varepsilon_2} - 1 $$\nSince the heat flux must be continuous through the system at steady state, these two composite resistances are in series. The total resistance of the system is the sum:\n$$ R''_{total} = R''_{1-s} + R''_{s-2} = \\left(\\frac{1}{\\varepsilon_1} + \\frac{1}{\\varepsilon_s} - 1\\right) + \\left(\\frac{1}{\\varepsilon_s} + \\frac{1}{\\varepsilon_2} - 1\\right) = \\frac{1}{\\varepsilon_1} + \\frac{1}{\\varepsilon_2} + \\frac{2}{\\varepsilon_s} - 2 $$\nThe net radiative heat flux per unit area is then the total potential difference divided by the total resistance:\n$$ q'' = \\frac{E_{b1} - E_{b2}}{R''_{total}} = \\frac{\\sigma(T_1^4 - T_2^4)}{\\frac{1}{\\varepsilon_1} + \\frac{1}{\\varepsilon_2} + \\frac{2}{\\varepsilon_s} - 2} $$\nThis expression, $q'' = f(T_1, T_2, \\varepsilon_1, \\varepsilon_2, \\varepsilon_s)$, is the derived model for the heat flux.\n\nNext, we compute the combined standard uncertainty, $u_{q''}$, using the first-order Taylor series approximation (the law of propagation of uncertainty). As the input quantities are uncorrelated, the square of the combined uncertainty is the sum of the squares of the individual uncertainty components:\n$$ u_{q''}^2 = \\sum_{i} \\left(\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x_i} u_{x_i}\\right)^2 = \\left(\\frac{\\partial q''}{\\partial T_1} u_{T_1}\\right)^2 + \\left(\\frac{\\partial q''}{\\partial T_2} u_{T_2}\\right)^2 + \\left(\\frac{\\partial q''}{\\partial \\varepsilon_1} u_{\\varepsilon_1}\\right)^2 + \\left(\\frac{\\partial q''}{\\partial \\varepsilon_2} u_{\\varepsilon_2}\\right)^2 + \\left(\\frac{\\partial q''}{\\partial \\varepsilon_s} u_{\\varepsilon_s}\\right)^2 $$\nThe Stefan-Boltzmann constant $\\sigma$ is treated as exact, so its uncertainty is zero ($u_{\\sigma}=0$) and it contributes nothing to the final uncertainty.\n\nWe now find the partial derivatives (sensitivity coefficients) of $q''$. Let $D = \\frac{1}{\\varepsilon_1} + \\frac{1}{\\varepsilon_2} + \\frac{2}{\\varepsilon_s} - 2$.\n$$ \\frac{\\partial q''}{\\partial T_1} = \\frac{4\\sigma T_1^3}{D} $$\n$$ \\frac{\\partial q''}{\\partial T_2} = -\\frac{4\\sigma T_2^3}{D} $$\n$$ \\frac{\\partial q''}{\\partial \\varepsilon_1} = \\sigma(T_1^4 - T_2^4) \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\varepsilon_1}(D^{-1}) = \\sigma(T_1^4 - T_2^4) (-1) D^{-2} \\left(-\\frac{1}{\\varepsilon_1^2}\\right) = \\frac{q''}{D \\varepsilon_1^2} $$\n$$ \\frac{\\partial q''}{\\partial \\varepsilon_2} = \\frac{q''}{D \\varepsilon_2^2} $$\n$$ \\frac{\\partial q''}{\\partial \\varepsilon_s} = \\sigma(T_1^4 - T_2^4) (-1) D^{-2} \\left(-\\frac{2}{\\varepsilon_s^2}\\right) = \\frac{2q''}{D \\varepsilon_s^2} $$\n\nNow, we substitute the given numerical values:\n$T_1 = 800\\,\\mathrm{K}$, $u_{T_1} = 1.0\\,\\mathrm{K}$\n$T_2 = 300\\,\\mathrm{K}$, $u_{T_2} = 1.0\\,\\mathrm{K}$\n$\\varepsilon_1 = 0.90$, $u_{\\varepsilon_1} = 0.01$\n$\\varepsilon_2 = 0.60$, $u_{\\varepsilon_2} = 0.01$\n$\\varepsilon_s = 0.10$, $u_{\\varepsilon_s} = 0.005$\n$\\sigma = 5.670374419 \\times 10^{-8}\\,\\mathrm{W\\,m^{-2}\\,K^{-4}}$\n\nFirst, calculate the nominal value of the denominator $D$ and the heat flux $q''$:\n$$ D = \\frac{1}{0.90} + \\frac{1}{0.60} + \\frac{2}{0.10} - 2 = \\frac{10}{9} + \\frac{5}{3} + 20 - 2 = \\frac{10+15}{9} + 18 = \\frac{25}{9} + 18 = \\frac{187}{9} \\approx 20.7778 $$\n$$ T_1^4 - T_2^4 = (800)^4 - (300)^4 = 4.096 \\times 10^{11} - 8.1 \\times 10^9 = 4.015 \\times 10^{11}\\,\\mathrm{K^4} $$\n$$ q'' = \\frac{(5.670374419 \\times 10^{-8})(4.015 \\times 10^{11})}{187/9} = \\frac{22770.81}{20.7778} \\approx 1095.92\\,\\mathrm{W\\,m^{-2}} $$\n\nNext, calculate the sensitivity coefficients:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial q''}{\\partial T_1} = \\frac{4 (5.670374419 \\times 10^{-8}) (800)^3}{187/9} \\approx 5.590\\,\\mathrm{W\\,m^{-2}\\,K^{-1}} $$\n$$ \\frac{\\partial q''}{\\partial T_2} = -\\frac{4 (5.670374419 \\times 10^{-8}) (300)^3}{187/9} \\approx -0.295\\,\\mathrm{W\\,m^{-2}\\,K^{-1}} $$\n$$ \\frac{\\partial q''}{\\partial \\varepsilon_1} = \\frac{1095.92}{(187/9)(0.90)^2} \\approx 65.11\\,\\mathrm{W\\,m^{-2}} $$\n$$ \\frac{\\partial q''}{\\partial \\varepsilon_2} = \\frac{1095.92}{(187/9)(0.60)^2} \\approx 146.51\\,\\mathrm{W\\,m^{-2}} $$\n$$ \\frac{\\partial q''}{\\partial \\varepsilon_s} = \\frac{2(1095.92)}{(187/9)(0.10)^2} \\approx 10549.2\\,\\mathrm{W\\,m^{-2}} $$\n\nNow, compute the individual contributions to the squared uncertainty:\n$$ u_{T_1}^2(q'') = (5.590 \\times 1.0)^2 \\approx 31.25\\,(\\mathrm{W\\,m^{-2}})^2 $$\n$$ u_{T_2}^2(q'') = (-0.295 \\times 1.0)^2 \\approx 0.09\\,(\\mathrm{W\\,m^{-2}})^2 $$\n$$ u_{\\varepsilon_1}^2(q'') = (65.11 \\times 0.01)^2 \\approx (0.6511)^2 \\approx 0.42\\,(\\mathrm{W\\,m^{-2}})^2 $$\n$$ u_{\\varepsilon_2}^2(q'') = (146.51 \\times 0.01)^2 \\approx (1.4651)^2 \\approx 2.15\\,(\\mathrm{W\\,m^{-2}})^2 $$\n$$ u_{\\varepsilon_s}^2(q'') = (10549.2 \\times 0.005)^2 \\approx (52.746)^2 \\approx 2782.14\\,(\\mathrm{W\\,m^{-2}})^2 $$\n\nThe combined variance is the sum of these components:\n$$ u_{q''}^2 \\approx 31.25 + 0.09 + 0.42 + 2.15 + 2782.14 = 2816.05\\,(\\mathrm{W\\,m^{-2}})^2 $$\nThe combined standard uncertainty is the square root of the variance:\n$$ u_{q''} = \\sqrt{2816.05} \\approx 53.066\\,\\mathrm{W\\,m^{-2}} $$\nRounding the result to three significant figures, as requested, yields the final answer.\n$$ u_{q''} \\approx 53.1\\,\\mathrm{W\\,m^{-2}} $$\nIt is clear that the uncertainty in the shield emissivity $\\varepsilon_s$ is the dominant contributor to the total uncertainty, a direct consequence of its small nominal value and its influence on the total thermal resistance.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{53.1}$$", "id": "2518008"}]}
