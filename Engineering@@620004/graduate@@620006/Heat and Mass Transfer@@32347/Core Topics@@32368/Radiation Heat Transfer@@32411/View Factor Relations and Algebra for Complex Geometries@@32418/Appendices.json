It is well-posed, as the geometry and objective are clearly defined. The request for a single numerical answer, despite the presence of symbolic parameters ($R, L, h$), suggests that the solution will be independent of these specific dimensions, a common outcome in problems involving infinite surfaces and symmetry. The constraints on the derivation method are clear and guide the solution strategy towards a conceptual proof rather than direct integration. The problem is free of contradictions, ambiguities, and factual errors.\n\n**Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is deemed **valid**. A solution will be provided following the prescribed methodology.\n\n**Derivation of the Configuration Factor $F_{c \\to p}$**\n\nThe configuration factor, or view factor, $F_{i \\to j}$ is defined as the fraction of radiation leaving a diffuse surface $A_i$ that arrives directly at surface $A_j$. We are asked to find $F_{c \\to p}$.\n\nThe given system, consisting of the cylinder 'c' and the infinite plane 'p', does not form an enclosure. Radiation leaving the cylinder that does not strike the plane escapes to the empty surroundings. To solve this problem using the powerful tools of view factor algebra, specifically the summation rule, we must first construct a proper enclosure.\n\nThis is accomplished through the method of **enclosure augmentation**. We introduce a fictitious surface to complete the enclosure around the cylinder 'c'.\nLet the infinite plane 'p' be designated as surface $A_1$. Let us establish a coordinate system where plane $A_1$ is the plane $z=0$. The axis of the cylinder 'c' is parallel to the $xy$-plane at a constant height $z=h$.\n\nWe now introduce a second, fictitious, infinite plane, designated as surface $A_2$, located at $z=2h$. This plane is parallel to $A_1$. This construction creates an enclosure formed by the two infinite parallel planes $A_1$ and $A_2$, with the cylinder 'c' situated exactly in the middle. Any radiation leaving the surface of cylinder 'c' must now be intercepted by either plane $A_1$ or plane $A_2$, as there is no other path for escape.\n\nFor any surface 'c' within an enclosure, the **summation rule** for view factors states that the sum of view factors from 'c' to all surfaces of the enclosure (including itself) must equal unity. Applying this to our augmented system:\n$$F_{c \\to 1} + F_{c \\to 2} + F_{c \\to c} = 1$$\nwhere $F_{c \\to 1}$ is the view factor from the cylinder to plane $A_1$ (our desired quantity, $F_{c \\to p}$), and $F_{c \\to 2}$ is the view factor from the cylinder to the fictitious plane $A_2$.\n\nThe lateral surface of a cylinder is a **convex surface**. A convex surface cannot \"see\" any part of itself. Therefore, the view factor from the cylinder to itself is zero:\n$$F_{c \\to c} = 0$$\nSubstituting this into the summation rule simplifies the equation to:\n$$F_{c \\to 1} + F_{c \\to 2} = 1$$\n\nNext, we apply a **symmetry argument**, as permitted by the problem statement. The enclosure is composed of two identical infinite planes, $A_1$ and $A_2$. The cylinder 'c' is positioned with its axis exactly halfway between them. The distance from the cylinder's axis to plane $A_1$ is $h$, and the distance from its axis to plane $A_2$ is likewise $|2h - h| = h$. Due to this geometric symmetry, the cylinder's \"view\" of plane $A_1$ is identical to its \"view\" of plane $A_2$. For any differential element of area on the cylinder surface, its position and orientation relative to plane $A_1$ are mirrored in its position and orientation relative to plane $A_2$. Consequently, the fraction of energy radiated from the entire cylinder surface 'c' that reaches plane $A_1$ must be equal to the fraction that reaches plane $A_2$. We can thus state:\n$$F_{c \\to 1} = F_{c \\to 2}$$\nThis conclusion is independent of the cylinder's specific dimensions ($R, L$) and its distance from the planes ($h$), as long as it is placed symmetrically.\n\nWe now substitute the result of the symmetry argument back into the simplified summation rule:\n$$F_{c \\to 1} + F_{c \\to 1} = 1$$\n$$2 F_{c \\to 1} = 1$$\nSolving for $F_{c \\to 1}$ yields:\n$$F_{c \\to 1} = \\frac{1}{2}$$\n\nSince $F_{c \\to 1}$ is the view factor from the cylinder to the original infinite plane 'p', we have found the desired quantity:\n$$F_{c \\to p} = \\frac{1}{2}$$\nThis result is a constant, independent of the cylinder's radius, length, and distance from the plane, which is consistent with the problem's requirement for a single numerical answer. The derivation relies exclusively on the summation rule and a justified symmetry argument applied to an augmented enclosure, thereby adhering to all methodological constraints.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{1}{2}}$$", "id": "2537099"}, {"introduction": "Having established foundational algebraic techniques, we now apply them to a practical engineering problem involving a multi-component system. This exercise requires you to analyze the heat transfer between two plates separated by a radiation shield, a common method for thermal insulation in high-temperature applications [@problem_id:2537090]. By modeling the system as a network of thermal resistances, you will connect the purely geometric view factors to surface properties like emissivity to determine the overall heat flux.", "problem": "A radiative enclosure is formed by two very large, parallel, diffuse–gray plates of equal area, denoted as surface $1$ and surface $3$, maintained at uniform absolute temperatures $T_{1}$ and $T_{3}$, with hemispherical emissivities $\\epsilon_{1}$ and $\\epsilon_{3}$, respectively. A thin, opaque, isothermal radiation shield is placed midway between plates $1$ and $3$. The shield is highly conducting within the plane of the sheet so that both of its sides are at the same uniform temperature $T_{s}$, but the two sides have different surface properties: the side facing surface $1$ (denote this fictitious surface as $2a$) has emissivity $\\epsilon_{2a}$, and the side facing surface $3$ (denote this fictitious surface as $2b$) has emissivity $\\epsilon_{2b}$. All surfaces behave as diffuse–gray emitters and reflectors. Edge effects are negligible, and the geometry may be treated as infinite parallel planes. There is no convection or conduction heat loss to the surroundings; the only mode of heat transfer between $1$ and $3$ is thermal radiation, mediated by the shield.\n\nStarting from the definitions of radiosity $J_{i}$ and irradiation $G_{i}$ for diffuse–gray surfaces, the enclosure view factor definition, the view factor summation and reciprocity rules, conservation of energy, and the Stefan–Boltzmann law for blackbody emissive power $E_{bi}=\\sigma T_{i}^{4}$, use view-factor algebra with fictitious surfaces to derive a closed-form expression for the net radiative heat flux from surface $1$ to surface $3$.

It is a scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective problem in the field of heat and mass transfer. It describes a classical scenario of radiative heat transfer between two parallel plates with a radiation shield, requiring derivation from first principles and subsequent numerical evaluation. The data provided are complete, consistent, and physically plausible.\n\nThe problem requires the derivation of the net radiative heat flux, $q''_{net}$, between two large parallel plates, surface $1$ and surface $3$, separated by a thin, opaque, isothermal radiation shield. The shield has different emissivities on its two sides: $\\epsilon_{2a}$ facing surface $1$, and $\\epsilon_{2b}$ facing surface $3$. All surfaces are diffuse-gray.\n\nWe begin with the fundamental equations for a diffuse-gray surface $i$. The net heat flux leaving the surface is the difference between its radiosity, $J_i$, and its irradiation, $G_i$:\n$$q''_i = J_i - G_i$$\nThe radiosity is the sum of emitted and reflected radiation:\n$$J_i = E_i + \\rho_i G_i = \\epsilon_i E_{bi} + (1 - \\epsilon_i) G_i$$\nwhere $E_{bi} = \\sigma T_i^4$ is the blackbody emissive power, $\\epsilon_i$ is the emissivity, and $\\rho_i = 1 - \\epsilon_i$ is the reflectivity for an opaque surface. From the radiosity definition, we can express the irradiation as $G_i = \\frac{J_i - \\epsilon_i E_{bi}}{1 - \\epsilon_i}$. Substituting this into the net heat flux equation yields:\n$$q''_i = J_i - \\frac{J_i - \\epsilon_i E_{bi}}{1 - \\epsilon_i} = \\frac{(1 - \\epsilon_i)J_i - J_i + \\epsilon_i E_{bi}}{1 - \\epsilon_i} = \\frac{\\epsilon_i(E_{bi} - J_i)}{1 - \\epsilon_i}$$\nThis expression can be rearranged to represent the potential difference $(E_{bi} - J_i)$ over a surface resistance, $R_s'' = \\frac{1 - \\epsilon_i}{\\epsilon_i}$. Thus, $q''_i = \\frac{E_{bi} - J_i}{R_s''}$.\n\nThe irradiation $G_i$ on a surface $i$ is the sum of radiosities from all other surfaces $j$ in the enclosure, weighted by the corresponding view factors $F_{ij}$.\n$$A_i G_i = \\sum_{j=1}^{N} A_j F_{ji} J_j$$\nBy the reciprocity rule, $A_j F_{ji} = A_i F_{ij}$, so $G_i = \\sum_{j=1}^{N} F_{ij} J_j$. The net heat rate exchanged between two surfaces $i$ and $j$ is $q_{ij} = A_i F_{ij} (J_i - J_j) = A_j F_{ji} (J_i - J_j)$. Per unit area of surface $i$, the flux is $q''_{ij} = F_{ij}(J_i - J_j)$. This can be seen as a potential difference $(J_i - J_j)$ over a space resistance per unit area, $R_{sp}'' = \\frac{1}{F_{ij}}$.\n\nThe system can be modeled as two separate two-surface enclosures connected in series: enclosure I between surface $1$ and the shield side $2a$, and enclosure II between the shield side $2b$ and surface $3$. The shield is isothermal at temperature $T_s$, so $E_{b,2a} = E_{b,2b} = E_{b,s} = \\sigma T_s^4$. In steady state, the net heat flux through enclosure I must equal the net heat flux through enclosure II, as the shield itself is a passive element with no net energy generation or storage.\n$$q''_{net} = q''_{1 \\to s} = q''_{s \\to 3}$$\nFor a two-surface enclosure between large parallel plates, the view factor is unity, i.e., $F_{1-2a} = 1$ and $F_{2b-3} = 1$. The net heat flux can be expressed using the thermal resistance network analogy. The total resistance for a two-surface parallel-plate enclosure is the sum of two surface resistances and one space resistance.\nFor enclosure I (surfaces $1$ and $2a$):\n$$q''_{1 \\to s} = \\frac{E_{b1} - E_{b,s}}{R''_{tot,1-2a}} = \\frac{\\sigma (T_1^4 - T_s^4)}{R''_{s,1} + R''_{sp,1-2a} + R''_{s,2a}}$$\nThe resistances per unit area are:\n$$R''_{s,1} = \\frac{1-\\epsilon_1}{\\epsilon_1}$$\n$$R''_{sp,1-2a} = \\frac{1}{F_{1-2a}} = 1$$\n$$R''_{s,2a} = \\frac{1-\\epsilon_{2a}}{\\epsilon_{2a}}$$\nSo, the total resistance for enclosure I is:\n$$R''_{tot,1-2a} = \\frac{1-\\epsilon_1}{\\epsilon_1} + 1 + \\frac{1-\\epsilon_{2a}}{\\epsilon_{2a}} = \\frac{1}{\\epsilon_1} + \\frac{1}{\\epsilon_{2a}} - 1$$\nAnd the heat flux is:\n$$q''_{1 \\to s} = \\frac{\\sigma(T_1^4 - T_s^4)}{\\frac{1}{\\epsilon_1} + \\frac{1}{\\epsilon_{2a}} - 1}$$\nSimilarly, for enclosure II (surfaces $2b$ and $3$):\n$$q''_{s \\to 3} = \\frac{E_{b,s} - E_{b3}}{R''_{tot,2b-3}} = \\frac{\\sigma (T_s^4 - T_3^4)}{R''_{s,2b} + R''_{sp,2b-3} + R''_{s,3}}$$\nThe total resistance for enclosure II is:\n$$R''_{tot,2b-3} = \\frac{1-\\epsilon_{2b}}{\\epsilon_{2b}} + 1 + \\frac{1-\\epsilon_3}{\\epsilon_3} = \\frac{1}{\\epsilon_{2b}} + \\frac{1}{\\epsilon_3} - 1$$\nAnd the heat flux is:\n$$q''_{s \\to 3} = \\frac{\\sigma(T_s^4 - T_3^4)}{\\frac{1}{\\epsilon_{2b}} + \\frac{1}{\\epsilon_3} - 1}$$\nEquating the two expressions for the heat flux ($q''_{1 \\to s} = q''_{s \\to 3}$), we can solve for $T_s^4$. However, it is more direct to represent the system as an overall series circuit. The total heat flux from surface $1$ to $3$ flows through both enclosures in series. The overall heat flux is driven by the potential difference $E_{b1} - E_{b3}$ across the total resistance $R''_{net} = R''_{tot,1-2a} + R''_{tot,2b-3}$.\n$$q''_{net} = \\frac{E_{b1} - E_{b3}}{R''_{net}} = \\frac{\\sigma(T_1^4 - T_3^4)}{R''_{tot,1-2a} + R''_{tot,2b-3}}$$\nSubstituting the expressions for the resistances gives the final closed-form expression:\n$$q''_{net} = \\frac{\\sigma(T_1^4 - T_3^4)}{\\left(\\frac{1}{\\epsilon_1} + \\frac{1}{\\epsilon_{2a}} - 1\\right) + \\left(\\frac{1}{\\epsilon_{2b}} + \\frac{1}{\\epsilon_3} - 1\\right)} = \\frac{\\sigma(T_1^4 - T_3^4)}{\\frac{1}{\\epsilon_1} + \\frac{1}{\\epsilon_{2a}} + \\frac{1}{\\epsilon_{2b}} + \\frac{1}{\\epsilon_3} - 2}$$\nNow, we evaluate this expression numerically with the given data:\n- $T_1 = 1.200 \\times 10^3\\ \\mathrm{K}$\n- $T_3 = 3.000 \\times 10^2\\ \\mathrm{K}$\n- $\\epsilon_1 = 0.70$\n- $\\epsilon_{2a} = 0.050$\n- $\\epsilon_{2b} = 0.20$\n- $\\epsilon_3 = 0.90$\n- $\\sigma = 5.670374419 \\times 10^{-8}\\ \\mathrm{W}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-2}\\,\\mathrm{K}^{-4}$\n\nFirst, calculate the numerator:\n$$T_1^4 = (1.200 \\times 10^3)^4\\ \\mathrm{K}^4 = 2.0736 \\times 10^{12}\\ \\mathrm{K}^4$$\n$$T_3^4 = (3.000 \\times 10^2)^4\\ \\mathrm{K}^4 = 8.100 \\times 10^9\\ \\mathrm{K}^4 = 0.0081 \\times 10^{12}\\ \\mathrm{K}^4$$\n$$\\sigma(T_1^4 - T_3^4) = (5.670374419 \\times 10^{-8})\\ (2.0736 \\times 10^{12} - 0.0081 \\times 10^{12})$$\n$$\\sigma(T_1^4 - T_3^4) = (5.670374419 \\times 10^{-8})\\ (2.0655 \\times 10^{12}) \\approx 117124.956\\ \\mathrm{W}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-2}$$\nNext, calculate the denominator (which is dimensionless):\n$$R''_{net} = \\frac{1}{0.70} + \\frac{1}{0.050} + \\frac{1}{0.20} + \\frac{1}{0.90} - 2$$\n$$R''_{net} \\approx 1.428571 + 20.0 + 5.0 + 1.111111 - 2 = 25.539682$$\nNow, compute the net heat flux:\n$$q''_{net} = \\frac{117124.956\\ \\mathrm{W}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-2}}{25.539682} \\approx 4585.996\\ \\mathrm{W}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-2}$$\nThe problem requires the answer in kilowatts per square meter ($\\mathrm{kW}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-2}$), rounded to four significant figures.\n$$q''_{net} \\approx 4.585996\\ \\mathrm{kW}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-2}$$\nRounding to four significant figures, we get $4.586\\ \\mathrm{kW}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-2}$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{4.586}$$", "id": "2537090"}, {"introduction": "While analytical and algebraic methods provide powerful insights, the vast majority of real-world geometries are too complex for closed-form solutions.

The view factor definition, its properties, the geometric representation, and the choice of Gauss-Legendre quadrature are all textbook-standard.\n- **Well-Posedness**: The problem is well-posed. The inputs for each test are explicitly defined, and the required outputs are unambiguous. A unique numerical solution exists for each specified quadrature order.\n- **Objectivity**: The problem is stated in precise, objective mathematical and physical language, free of any subjectivity or ambiguity.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. It is a well-defined task in computational physics requiring the implementation of a numerical algorithm from first principles. A solution will be provided.\n\n**Principle-Based Solution Design**\n\nThe task is to compute the view factor $F_{1 \\to 2}$, a dimensionless quantity representing the fraction of radiation leaving surface $A_1$ that arrives directly at surface $A_2$. The governing equation is a four-dimensional integral over the two surfaces.\n\nFirst, we must express the integral in terms of the parametric coordinates. A point $\\mathbf{r}_1$ on surface $S_1$ is given by $\\mathbf{r}_1(u_1, v_1) = \\mathbf{o}_1 + u_1 \\mathbf{a}_1 + v_1 \\mathbf{b}_1$, and similarly $\\mathbf{r}_2(u_2, v_2)$ for surface $S_2$. The differential area elements are $\\mathrm{d}A_1 = \\|\\mathbf{a}_1 \\times \\mathbf{b}_1\\| \\, \\mathrm{d}u_1 \\, \\mathrm{d}v_1 = A_1 \\, \\mathrm{d}u_1 \\, \\mathrm{d}v_1$ and $\\mathrm{d}A_2 = A_2 \\, \\mathrm{d}u_2 \\mathrm{d}v_2$. Substituting these into the definition of $F_{1 \\to 2}$ gives:\n$$\nF_{1 \\to 2} = \\frac{1}{A_1} \\int_0^1 \\int_0^1 \\int_0^1 \\int_0^1 \\frac{\\cos\\theta_1 \\cos\\theta_2}{\\pi R^2} (A_2 \\, \\mathrm{d}u_2 \\mathrm{d}v_2) (A_1 \\, \\mathrm{d}u_1 \\mathrm{d}v_1)\n$$\nThis simplifies to a pure parametric integral over a hypercube $[0,1]^4$:\n$$\nF_{1 \\to 2} = A_2 \\int_0^1 \\int_0^1 \\int_0^1 \\int_0^1 \\frac{\\cos\\theta_1 \\cos\\theta_2}{\\pi R^2} \\, \\mathrm{d}u_1 \\mathrm{d}v_1 \\mathrm{d}u_2 \\mathrm{d}v_2\n$$\nHere, for each quadruplet $(u_1, v_1, u_2, v_2)$, we have:\n- Point on $S_1$: $\\mathbf{r}_1 = \\mathbf{o}_1 + u_1\\mathbf{a}_1 + v_1\\mathbf{b}_1$\n- Point on $S_2$: $\\mathbf{r}_2 = \\mathbf{o}_2 + u_2\\mathbf{a}_2 + v_2\\mathbf{b}_2$\n- Inter-point vector: $\\mathbf{R} = \\mathbf{r}_2 - \\mathbf{r}_1$\n- Distance: $R = \\|\\mathbf{R}\\|$\n- Angle cosines: $\\cos\\theta_1 = \\mathbf{n}_1 \\cdot \\frac{\\mathbf{R}}{R}$ and $\\cos\\theta_2 = \\mathbf{n}_2 \\cdot \\frac{-\\mathbf{R}}{R}$\n\nTo evaluate this integral numerically, we employ an $n$-th order Gauss-Legendre quadrature, forming a tensor product over the four dimensions $(u_1, v_1, u_2, v_2)$. Let $\\{u_k, \\tilde{w}_k\\}_{k=1}^n$ be the quadrature nodes and weights respectively, mapped from the standard interval $[-1,1]$ to $[0,1]$. The integral is approximated by the sum:\n$$\nF_{1 \\to 2} \\approx A_2 \\sum_{i=1}^n \\sum_{j=1}^n \\sum_{p=1}^n \\sum_{q=1}^n (\\tilde{w}_i \\tilde{w}_j \\tilde{w}_p \\tilde{w}_q) \\left[ \\frac{\\cos\\theta_{1,ijpq} \\cos\\theta_{2,ijpq}}{\\pi R_{ijpq}^2} \\right]\n$$\nwhere the term in brackets is the integrand evaluated at points corresponding to nodes $(u_i, u_j, u_p, u_q)$ and is set to $0$ if visibility fails ($\\cos\\theta_1 \\le 0$ or $\\cos\\theta_2 \\le 0$).\n\nThe implementation will be structured as follows:\n1.  A class `Surface` is defined to encapsulate the geometric properties of a parallelogram: its origin $\\mathbf{o}$, spanning vectors $\\mathbf{a}$ and $\\mathbf{b}$, and normal sign parameter $s$. This class will compute and store its area $A$ and outward unit normal vector $\\mathbf{n}$.\n2.  A helper function will generate the required Gauss-Legendre nodes and weights on $[0,1]$ using `scipy.special.roots_legendre`, with caching to prevent redundant calculations for the same order $n$.\n3.  The core computational function, `compute_view_factor`, implements the numerical integration. To achieve high performance, this function is vectorized using `numpy`. It generates the full sets of $n^2$ quadrature points and weights for each surface. Then, matrix and tensor operations are used to compute all $n^4$ pairwise interactions, distances, angle cosines, and the final weighted sum in a single pass, avoiding explicit, slow Python loops. This is the only acceptable approach for serious numerical work.\n4.  The four test cases are executed sequentially. Test $1$ and Test $3$ verify the crucial algebraic properties of reciprocity and additivity, demonstrating the self-consistency of the formulation. Test $2$ confirms the convergence of the numerical quadrature, a necessary condition for a reliable numerical method. Test $4$ evaluates the algorithm's performance on a far-field case where the view factor is small.\n\nThe final Python code implements this design to compute the required results for the test suite.", "answer": "```python\n# The complete and runnable Python 3 code goes here.\n# Imports must adhere to the specified execution environment.\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy.special import roots_legendre\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Main function to orchestrate the view factor calculations and tests.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Use a cache for Gauss-Legendre quadrature data to avoid recomputation\n    gl_cache = {}\n\n    class Surface:\n        \"\"\"\n        Represents a planar parallelogram surface in 3D space.\n        \"\"\"\n        def __init__(self, o, a, b, s):\n            self.o = np.array(o, dtype=float)\n            self.a = np.array(a, dtype=float)\n            self.b = np.array(b, dtype=float)\n            self.s = s\n            \n            cross_prod = np.cross(self.a, self.b)\n            self.area = np.linalg.norm(cross_prod)\n            \n            if self.area < 1e-12:\n                # Handle degenerate parallelograms\n                self.normal = np.array([0.0, 0.0, 0.0])\n            else:\n                self.normal = self.s * cross_prod / self.area\n\n    def get_gauss_legendre(n, cache):\n        \"\"\"\n        Generates Gauss-Legendre nodes and weights for the interval [0, 1].\n        Results are cached to improve performance.\n        \"\"\"\n        if n not in cache:\n            nodes_m11, weights_m11 = roots_legendre(n)\n            nodes_01 = (nodes_m11 + 1.0) / 2.0\n            weights_01 = weights_m11 / 2.0\n            cache[n] = (nodes_01, weights_01)\n        return cache[n]\n\n    def compute_view_factor(s1, s2, n, cache):\n        \"\"\"\n        Computes the view factor F_{1->2} using n-order Gauss-Legendre quadrature.\n        \"\"\"\n        nodes, weights = get_gauss_legendre(n, cache)\n\n        # Generate n x n grid of parametric coordinates and weights for each surface\n        u_grid, v_grid = np.meshgrid(nodes, nodes)\n        wu_grid, wv_grid = np.meshgrid(weights, weights)\n\n        # Flatten grids to get 1D arrays of n^2 points/weights\n        u_flat = u_grid.flatten()\n        v_flat = v_grid.flatten()\n        w_flat = (wu_grid * wv_grid).flatten()\n\n        # Generate n^2 quadrature points in R^3 for each surface\n        # pts1 and pts2 will have shape (n^2, 3)\n        pts1 = s1.o + u_flat[:, np.newaxis] * s1.a + v_flat[:, np.newaxis] * s1.b\n        pts2 = s2.o + u_flat[:, np.newaxis] * s2.a + v_flat[:, np.newaxis] * s2.b\n        \n        # Vectorized calculation over all n^2 x n^2 point pairs\n        # R_vec has shape (n^2, n^2, 3) where R_vec[i, j, :] = pts2[j] -
