It is therefore deemed valid and will be solved as stated. The solution is structured into three parts as requested: derivation of the heat flux expression, numerical evaluation, and a qualitative discussion of edge effects.\n\n**Part 1: Derivation of Net Radiative Heat Flux**\n\nWe begin with the fundamental principles of radiative exchange between two surfaces. The surfaces are designated as surface $1$ and surface $2$, with absolute temperatures $T_1$ and $T_2$, respectively.\n\nThe total energy radiated per unit area from a blackbody surface at temperature $T$ is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law for hemispherical emissive power:\n$$E_b(T) = \\sigma T^4$$\nwhere $\\sigma$ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.\n\nFor a diffuse surface, the intensity of emitted radiation, $I_e$, is uniform in all directions within the hemisphere above the surface. The relation between emissive power and intensity for a diffuse emitter is $E = \\pi I_e$.\n\nThe total radiative energy leaving a surface per unit area is termed its radiosity, $J$. For a perfectly black surface, there is no reflection, so all radiation leaving the surface must be from emission. Therefore, the radiosity of a black surface is equal to its emissive power.\nFor surface $1$: $J_1 = E_{b1} = \\sigma T_1^4$.\nFor surface $2$: $J_2 = E_{b2} = \\sigma T_2^4$.\n\nThe view factor, $F_{1 \\to 2}$ or $F_{12}$, is defined as the fraction of the total radiation leaving surface $1$ that arrives directly at surface $2$. The total rate of heat transfer from surface $1$ to surface $2$ is the product of the total energy leaving surface $1$ and the view factor:\n$$Q_{1 \\to 2} = A_1 J_1 F_{12}$$\nwhere $A_1$ is the area of surface $1$.\n\nSimilarly, the total rate of heat transfer from surface $2$ to surface $1$ is:\n$$Q_{2 \\to 1} = A_2 J_2 F_{21}$$\nwhere $A_2$ is the area of surface $2$ and $F_{21}$ is the view factor from surface $2$ to surface $1$.\n\nThe net rate of heat transfer between the two surfaces, $Q_{net}$, is the difference between these two quantities:\n$$Q_{net} = Q_{1 \\to 2} - Q_{2 \\to 1} = A_1 J_1 F_{12} - A_2 J_2 F_{21}$$\n\nA fundamental property of view factors is the reciprocity relation: $A_1 F_{12} = A_2 F_{21}$. Applying this relation, the expression for net heat transfer simplifies to:\n$$Q_{net} = A_1 F_{12} (J_1 - J_2)$$\n\nThe net radiative heat flux per unit area, $q''_{net}$, is defined as $Q_{net}/A_1$.\n$$q''_{net} = \\frac{Q_{net}}{A_1} = F_{12} (J_1 - J_2)$$\n\nThe problem states that the surfaces are \"very large, plane, parallel plates\" and that \"edge effects can be neglected\". This is the idealization of two infinite parallel plates. In this configuration, any radiation leaving any point on surface $1$ must intercept surface $2$, as there is no other surface for it to see. Therefore, the fraction of energy leaving surface $1$ that strikes surface $2$ is unity.\n$$F_{12} = 1$$\n\nSubstituting $F_{12}=1$ and the expressions for the radiosities of the black surfaces into the heat flux equation yields the final expression:\n$$q''_{net} = 1 \\cdot (\\sigma T_1^4 - \\sigma T_2^4) = \\sigma (T_1^4 - T_2^4)$$\n\nThis is the canonical expression for the net radiative heat flux between two infinite, parallel, black plates.\n\n**Part 2: Numerical Evaluation**\n\nThe problem provides the following values for numerical evaluation:\n- Temperature of surface $1$, $T_1 = 1000 \\ \\mathrm{K}$\n- Temperature of surface $2$, $T_2 = 500 \\ \\mathrm{K}$\n- Stefan-Boltzmann constant, $\\sigma = 5.670374419 \\times 10^{-8} \\ \\mathrm{W\\,m^{-2}K^{-4}}$\n\nWe substitute these values into the derived expression for the net heat flux:\n$$q''_{net} = (5.670374419 \\times 10^{-8} \\ \\mathrm{W\\,m^{-2}K^{-4}}) \\times \\left[ (1000 \\ \\mathrm{K})^4 - (500 \\ \\mathrm{K})^4 \\right]$$\n\nFirst, we evaluate the temperature terms:\n$$(1000)^4 = (10^3)^4 = 10^{12} \\ \\mathrm{K}^4$$\n$$(500)^4 = (5 \\times 10^2)^4 = 5^4 \\times (10^2)^4 = 625 \\times 10^8 = 0.0625 \\times 10^{12} \\ \\mathrm{K}^4$$\n\nThe difference is:\n$$T_1^4 - T_2^4 = 10^{12} - 0.0625 \\times 10^{12} = (1 - 0.0625) \\times 10^{12} = 0.9375 \\times 10^{12} \\ \\mathrm{K}^4$$\n\nNow, we calculate the heat flux:\n$$q''_{net} = (5.670374419 \\times 10^{-8}) \\times (0.9375 \\times 10^{12}) \\ \\mathrm{W\\,m^{-2}}$$\n$$q''_{net} = 5.315975918... \\times 10^4 \\ \\mathrm{W\\,m^{-2}}$$\n\nThe result is required in units of kilowatts per square meter ($\\mathrm{kW\\,m^{-2}}$):\n$$q''_{net} = 53.15975918... \\ \\mathrm{kW\\,m^{-2}}$$\n\nRounding to four significant figures, we obtain:\n$$q''_{net} \\approx 53.16 \\ \\mathrm{kW\\,m^{-2}}$$\n\n**Part 3: Qualitative Discussion of Edge Effects**\n\nThe derivation in Part $1$ assumes infinitely large plates, which simplifies the view factor $F_{12}$ to $1$. If the plates are finite, identical squares of side length $L$ separated by a gap $s$, this idealization breaks down, and edge effects become significant.\n\nThe primary modification is that the view factor from surface $1$ to surface $2$, $F_{12}$, is now less than $1$. This is because radiation emitted from locations near the edges of surface $1$ can now escape into the surroundings through the gap between the plates, rather than striking surface $2$. The surroundings are typically modeled as a blackbody at a very low temperature (e.g., $T_{surr} \\to 0 \\ \\mathrm{K}$), acting as a perfect sink.\n\nThe average net heat flux per unit area between the two finite plates, $q''_{finite}$, is given by $F_{12} \\sigma (T_1^4 - T_2^4)$. Since $F_{12}  1$, the net radiative exchange per unit area for finite plates is always less than that for infinite plates: $q''_{finite}  q''_{infinite}$. Furthermore, the local heat flux is no longer uniform across the plate surfaces. It is highest near the center of the plates, where the geometry most resembles the infinite case, and decreases toward the edges, where the \"view\" of the opposing plate is increasingly obstructed by the open surroundings.\n\nThe magnitude of this deviation depends on the geometric ratio $s/L$. We analyze the two requested limits:\n\n1.  **Limit $s/L \\to 0$**: This corresponds to the separation distance being much smaller than the plate dimension. In this limit, the geometry closely approaches that of infinite parallel plates. The edge effects are a small perturbation. The fraction of energy that \"leaks\" out of the edges is expected to be proportional to the ratio of the \"open\" peripheral area ($A_{edge} \\sim 4Ls$) to a characteristic area of emission. A more rigorous analysis shows that the leading-order correction to the view factor is proportional to the ratio $s/L$. That is, $F_{12} \\approx 1 - C(s/L)$ for some constant $C$ of order unity. Thus, the leading-order correction to the heat flux, which is $q''_{infinite} - q''_{finite} = (1 - F_{12}) \\sigma (T_1^4 - T_2^4)$, scales linearly with the geometric ratio $s/L$.\n\n2.  **Limit $s/L \\to \\infty$**: This corresponds to the separation distance being much larger than the plate dimension. In this limit, the plates are very far apart. From the perspective of any point on one plate, the other plate subtends a very small solid angle. The infinite-plate model is entirely inappropriate here. We can approximate the view factor by considering the plates as differential areas separated by a large distance $s$. The view factor from a differential area $dA_1$ to a finite area $A_2$ at distance $r$ is $dF_{dA_1 \\to A_2} = \\frac{\\cos\\theta_1 \\cos\\theta_2}{\\pi r^2} A_2$. For two small, parallel plates of area $A=L^2$ separated by a large distance $s$, we have $r \\approx s$, $\\theta_1 \\approx 0$, and $\\theta_2 \\approx 0$. The view factor from plate $1$ to plate $2$ becomes approximately constant across the surface:\n    $$F_{12} \\approx \\frac{A_2}{\\pi s^2} = \\frac{L^2}{\\pi s^2} = \\frac{1}{\\pi} \\left(\\frac{L}{s}\\right)^2$$\n    In this limit, the entire net heat flux, $q''_{finite}=F_{12}q''_{infinite}$, scales as $(L/s)^2$, or $(s/L)^{-2}$. The flux approaches zero very rapidly as the separation increases.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{53.16}$$", "id": "2518874"}, {"introduction": "Building on the idealized parallel-plate model, we now address a more realistic configuration: two-dimensional systems with finite cross-sections, such as long rectangular ducts.

The surfaces are black, isothermal, and are arranged in a two-dimensional configuration.\n\nFirst, we determine the view factor $F_{12}$ using the crossed-string method (Hottel's rule). For two surfaces of area $A_1$ and $A_2$ that are infinitely long in one direction, the product of the area of surface $1$ per unit length, $A'_1$, and the view factor $F_{12}$ is given by:\n$$A'_1 F_{12} = \\frac{1}{2} \\left[ (\\text{Sum of lengths of crossed strings}) - (\\text{Sum of lengths of uncrossed strings}) \\right]$$\nHere, the area per unit length of Plate $1$ is $A'_1 = a \\times 1 = a$.\n\nLet us set up a coordinate system.

Their lengths are $L_{1L,2R}$ and $L_{1R,2L}$.

For two black surfaces, the net heat transfer from surface $1$ to surface $2$ is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law, modified by the view factor:\n$$Q_{12} = A_1 F_{12} \\sigma (T_1^4 - T_2^4)$$\nwhere $\\sigma$ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.

The total irradiation on surface $i$ is the sum over all $j$:\n    $$ G_i A_i = \\sum_{j=1}^N (J_j A_j) F_{ji} $$\n    Applying the reciprocity relation, $A_j F_{ji} = A_i F_{ij}$, we simplify the expression for $G_i$:\n    $$ G_i A_i = \\sum_{j=1}^N J_j (A_i F_{ij}) \\implies G_i = \\sum_{j=1}^N J_j F_{ij} $$\n\n3.  **Net Radiative Heat Rate**: The net radiative heat rate $Q_i$ leaving surface $i$ is the difference between the outgoing and incoming radiative energy:\n    $$ Q_i = A_i (J_i - G_i) $$\n\n4.  **System Formulation**: We combine these fundamental relations. Substituting the expressions for $J_i$ and $G_i$ into the heat rate equation:\n    $$ Q_i = A_i \\left( \\sigma T_i^4 - \\sum_{j=1}^N (\\sigma T_j^4) F_{ij} \\right) $$\n    Dividing by $A_i$ and factoring out $\\sigma$:\n    $$ \\frac{Q_i}{A_i} = \\sigma \\left( T_i^4 - \\sum_{j=1}^N T_j^4 F_{ij} \\right) $$\n    As instructed, we introduce the variable transformation $x_i = T_i^4$. The system becomes linear in terms of the variables $\\{x_i\\}$:\n    $$ \\frac{Q_i}{A_i} = \\sigma \\left( x_i - \\sum_{j=1}^N x_j F_{ij} \\right) $$\n    This provides one equation for each of the $N$ surfaces.\n\n5.  **Formation of a Solvable Linear System**: The surfaces are partitioned into two sets: set $\\mathcal{T}$ where temperatures $T_k$ (and thus $x_k = T_k^4$) are known, and set $\\mathcal{Q}$ where heat rates $Q_k$ are known but temperatures $T_k$ (and thus $x_k$) are unknown. We must solve for $\\{x_i | i \\in \\mathcal{Q}\\}$.\n\n    We rearrange the equation for each surface $i \\in \\mathcal{Q}$ to isolate the unknown variables on one side:\n    $$ x_i - \\sum_{j=1}^N x_j F_{ij} = \\frac{Q_i}{\\sigma A_i} $$\n    Using the summation rule $\\sum_{j=1}^N F_{ij} = 1$, we can write $x_i = x_i \\sum_{j=1}^N F_{ij} = \\sum_{j=1}^N x_i F_{ij}$. This allows us to rewrite the equation as:\n    $$ \\sum_{j=1}^N (x_i - x_j) F_{ij} = \\frac{Q_i}{\\sigma A_i} $$\n    We can now separate the sum over unknown and known variables. For an equation corresponding to a surface $i \\in \\mathcal{Q}$:\n    $$ \\sum_{j \\in \\mathcal{Q}} (x_i - x_j) F_{ij} = \\frac{Q_i}{\\sigma A_i} + \\sum_{k \\in \\mathcal{T}} (x_k - x_i) F_{ik} $$\n    This constitutes a system of $|\\mathcal{Q}|$ linear algebraic equations in $|\\mathcal{Q}|$ unknowns. It can be written in matrix form as $M \\mathbf{X} = \\mathbf{b}$, where:\n    - $\\mathbf{X}$ is the column vector of unknown variables $\\{x_j\\}_{j \\in \\mathcal{Q}}$.\n    - The coefficient matrix $M$ has elements corresponding to the indices of surfaces in $\\mathcal{Q}$. Let $i'$ and $j'$ be the row and column indices of $M$, and $i, j$ be the corresponding surface indices from $\\mathcal{Q}$.\n      - $M_{i'i'} = \\sum_{j \\in \\mathcal{Q}, j \\neq i} F_{ij} + \\sum_{k \\in \\mathcal{T}} F_{ik} = 1 - F_{ii} - \\sum_{j \\in \\mathcal{Q}, j=i} F_{ij} = 1-F_{ii}$.\n      - $M_{i'j'} = -F_{ij}$ for $i \\neq j$\n    - The right-hand side vector $\\mathbf{b}$ has elements $b_{i'}$ corresponding to surface $i \\in \\mathcal{Q}$:\n      - $b_{i'} = \\frac{Q_i}{\\sigma A_i} + \\sum_{k \\in \\mathcal{T}} F_{ik} x_k$ where $x_k = T_k^4$ are known values.\n\n6.  **Solution Procedure**:\n    For each test case, we will:\n    a. Identify the sets $\\mathcal{T}$ and $\\mathcal{Q}$.\n    b. Construct the matrix $M$ and vector $\\mathbf{b}$ using the provided data ($A_i, F_{ij}, Q_i, T_k$).\n    c. Solve the linear system $M \\mathbf{X} = \\mathbf{b}$ for the vector of unknowns $\\mathbf{X}$.\n    d. For each component $x_i$ of the solution vector $\\mathbf{X}$, compute the corresponding temperature $T_i = (x_i)^{1/4}$.\n    e. Collect the computed temperatures, round them to three decimal places, and format them as required.\n\nThis structured, principle-based approach ensures correctness and adherence to the problem constraints.", "answer": "```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves for unknown temperatures in radiative heat transfer problems\n    for enclosures of diffuse, black surfaces.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    sigma = 5.670374419e-8\n\n    def solve_radiative_system(N, A, F, T_known, Q_known):\n        \"\"\"\n        Forms and solves the linear system for unknown temperatures.\n\n        Args:\n            N (int): Number of surfaces.\n            A (np.ndarray): Array of surface areas (m^2).\n            F (np.ndarray): Matrix of view factors.\n            T_known (dict): Dictionary of {surface_idx: temp_K} for surfaces with known temperature.\n            Q_known (dict): Dictionary of {surface_idx: heat_rate_W} for surfaces with known heat rate.\n\n        Returns:\n            list: A list of the calculated unknown temperatures in Kelvin, sorted by surface index.\n        \"\"\"\n        # Indices of surfaces with unknown temperature (surfaces with prescribed Q)\n        q_indices = sorted(list(Q_known.keys()))\n        \n        # Indices of surfaces with known temperature (surfaces with prescribed T)\n        t_indices = sorted(list(T_known.keys()))\n        \n        num_unknowns = len(q_indices)\n        if num_unknowns == 0:\n            return []\n\n        # Pre-calculate x_k = T_k^4 for known temperatures\n        x_known = {k: v**4 for k, v in T_known.items()}\n        \n        # Initialize the matrix M and vector b for the system M*X = b\n        M = np.zeros((num_unknowns, num_unknowns))\n        b = np.zeros(num_unknowns)\n        \n        # Populate the matrix M and vector b\n        for i in range(num_unknowns):\n            surf_i = q_indices[i] # This is the 1-based surface index\n            idx_i = surf_i -
