It presents a classical problem in the theory of radiative heat transfer and requests a derivation from first principles, which is a valid and fundamental exercise. No flaws are identified. We proceed with the derivation.\n\nThe view factor, or configuration factor, $F_{ij}$ from a surface $A_i$ to a surface $A_j$ is defined by the integral relation:\n$$ F_{ij} = \\frac{1}{A_i} \\int_{A_i} \\int_{A_j} \\frac{\\cos\\theta_i \\cos\\theta_j}{\\pi R^2} dA_j dA_i $$\nwhere $dA_i$ and $dA_j$ are differential area elements on surfaces $i$ and $j$ respectively, $R$ is the magnitude of the vector connecting these elements, and $\\theta_i$ and $\\theta_j$ are the angles between this connecting vector and the respective surface normals.\n\nWe are given two parallel, infinite planar surfaces. Let surface $1$ be the plane $z=0$ and surface $2$ be the plane $z=H$, where $H>0$. The outward unit normal for surface $1$ is $\\mathbf{n}_1 = (0, 0, 1)$ and for surface $2$ is $\\mathbf{n}_2 = (0, 0, -1)$.\n\nLet us first derive the view factor $F_{12}$. We select a differential area element $dA_1$ on surface $1$ at location $\\mathbf{r}_1 = (x_1, y_1, 0)$ and a differential area element $dA_2$ on surface $2$ at location $\\mathbf{r}_2 = (x_2, y_2, H)$. The vector $\\mathbf{R}$ from $dA_1$ to $dA_2$ is given by:\n$$ \\mathbf{R} = \\mathbf{r}_2 - \\mathbf{r}_1 = (x_2-x_1)\\mathbf{\\hat{i}} + (y_2-y_1)\\mathbf{\\hat{j}} + H\\mathbf{\\hat{k}} $$\nThe squared magnitude of this vector is:\n$$ R^2 = (x_2-x_1)^2 + (y_2-y_1)^2 + H^2 $$\nThe angles $\\theta_1$ and $\\theta_2$ are found from the dot product with the respective normal vectors.\n$$ \\cos\\theta_1 = \\frac{\\mathbf{R} \\cdot \\mathbf{n}_1}{R} = \\frac{H}{R} $$\n$$ \\cos\\theta_2 = \\frac{-\\mathbf{R} \\cdot \\mathbf{n}_2}{R} = \\frac{-(-H)}{R} = \\frac{H}{R} $$\nThe term $-\\mathbf{R}$ is used for the second cosine because the vector from $dA_2$ to $dA_1$ is $-\\mathbf{R}$, and the angle definition is symmetric. Equivalently, and more directly, $\\theta_2$ is the angle between the vector from $1$ to $2$ ($\\mathbf{R}$) and the normal of surface $2$ ($\\mathbf{n}_2$), but we must take the component of $\\mathbf{R}$ along $\\mathbf{n}_2$ as pointing away from the surface, which is standard. For parallel plates, both angles are identical.\n\nSubstituting these into the view factor integral for $F_{12}$:\n$$ F_{12} = \\frac{1}{A_1} \\int_{A_1} \\left( \\int_{A_2} \\frac{(H/R)(H/R)}{\\pi R^2} dA_2 \\right) dA_1 = \\frac{1}{A_1} \\int_{A_1} \\left( \\int_{A_2} \\frac{H^2}{\\pi R^4} dA_2 \\right) dA_1 $$\nThe inner integral represents the view factor from a differential element $dA_1$ to the finite surface $A_2$, denoted $F_{dA_1 \\to A_2}$.\n$$ F_{dA_1 \\to A_2} = \\int_{A_2} \\frac{H^2}{\\pi R^4} dA_2 = \\int_{A_2} \\frac{H^2}{\\pi \\left( (x_2-x_1)^2 + (y_2-y_1)^2 + H^2 \\right)^2} dx_2 dy_2 $$\nDue to the infinite extent of both planes, the geometry is translationally invariant. The value of this inner integral is independent of the location $(x_1, y_1)$ of $dA_1$. We can therefore, without loss of generality, place $dA_1$ at the origin $(0, 0, 0)$. The expression simplifies to:\n$$ F_{dA_1 \\to A_2} = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\frac{H^2}{\\pi (x_2^2 + y_2^2 + H^2)^2} dx_2 dy_2 $$\nTo solve this integral, we switch to a polar coordinate system on the plane $z=H$, centered at $(0, 0, H)$. Let $x_2 = r\\cos\\phi$ and $y_2 = r\\sin\\phi$. The differential area element becomes $dA_2 = r dr d\\phi$. The integration limits are $r \\in [0, \\infty)$ and $\\phi \\in [0, 2\\pi]$.\n$$ F_{dA_1 \\to A_2} = \\int_{0}^{2\\pi} \\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\frac{H^2}{\\pi (r^2 + H^2)^2} r dr d\\phi $$\nSince the integrand is independent of $\\phi$, the integration over $\\phi$ yields a factor of $2\\pi$.\n$$ F_{dA_1 \\to A_2} = \\frac{2\\pi H^2}{\\pi} \\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\frac{r}{(r^2 + H^2)^2} dr = 2H^2 \\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\frac{r}{(r^2 + H^2)^2} dr $$\nWe perform a substitution. Let $u = r^2 + H^2$. Then $du = 2r dr$, or $r dr = du/2$. The limits of integration change from $r=0 \\implies u=H^2$ to $r \\to \\infty \\implies u \\to \\infty$.\n$$ F_{dA_1 \\to A_2} = 2H^2 \\int_{H^2}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{u^2} \\frac{du}{2} = H^2 \\left[ -\\frac{1}{u} \\right]_{H^2}^{\\infty} = H^2 \\left( \\lim_{u\\to\\infty} \\left(-\\frac{1}{u}\\right) - \\left(-\\frac{1}{H^2}\\right) \\right) = H^2 \\left( 0 + \\frac{1}{H^2} \\right) = 1 $$\nSo, the view factor from any differential element on surface $1$ to the entire surface $2$ is $1$. The total view factor $F_{12}$ is the area-average of this value:\n$$ F_{12} = \\frac{1}{A_1} \\int_{A_1} F_{dA_1 \\to A_2} dA_1 = \\frac{1}{A_1} \\int_{A_1} 1 \\cdot dA_1 = \\frac{A_1}{A_1} = 1 $$\nThis is physically correct: all diffuse radiation emitted from the infinite plane $1$ into the positive hemisphere must intercept the infinite plane $2$.\n\nNext, we evaluate $F_{11}$. This factor represents the fraction of radiation leaving surface $1$ that strikes itself. Since surface $1$ is a plane, it is not possible for any point on the surface to \"see\" any other point on the same surface. The line segment connecting any two distinct points on a plane lies within that plane. The angle $\\theta_1$ between the surface normal $\\mathbf{n}_1$ (which is perpendicular to the plane) and this connecting line is therefore always $\\pi/2$.\nConsequently, $\\cos\\theta_1 = \\cos(\\pi/2) = 0$ for any pair of elements on surface $1$. The integrand in the defining equation for $F_{11}$ is zero everywhere.\n$$ F_{11} = \\frac{1}{A_1} \\int_{A_1} \\int_{A_1} \\frac{\\cos\\theta_1 \\cos\\theta'_1}{\\pi R^2} dA'_1 dA_1 = 0 $$\nThis property holds for any planar or convex surface.\n\nFinally, we evaluate $F_{22}$. The geometric argument for $F_{11}$ applies identically to surface $2$. It is also an infinite plane, and thus it cannot see itself. Therefore,\n$$ F_{22} = 0 $$\n\nWe have derived the required view factors from first principles as $F_{12}=1$, $F_{11}=0$, and $F_{22}=0$.

A solution will be derived.\n\n**Derivation**\n\nThe analysis of radiative exchange in an enclosure of diffuse, gray surfaces is founded upon the concepts of radiosity and irradiation.\nThe radiosity $J_i$ of a surface $i$ is the total radiant energy leaving the surface per unit area, comprising emitted and reflected radiation:\n$$J_i = \\epsilon_i E_{b,i} + \\rho_i H_i$$\nFor an opaque surface, reflectivity $\\rho_i = 1 - \\alpha_i$. For a gray surface, absorptivity $\\alpha_i = \\epsilon_i$. Thus, $\\rho_i = 1 - \\epsilon_i$.\n$$J_i = \\epsilon_i E_{b,i} + (1 - \\epsilon_i) H_i$$\nThe irradiation $H_i$ on a surface $i$ is the total radiant energy incident on the surface per unit area, originating from all surfaces in the enclosure:\n$$H_i = \\sum_{j=1}^{3} F_{ij} J_j$$\nThe governing equations for the radiosities of the three surfaces are:\n1. $J_1 = \\epsilon_1 E_{b,1} + (1 - \\epsilon_1) (F_{11}J_1 + F_{12}J_2 + F_{13}J_3)$\n2. $J_2 = \\epsilon_2 E_{b,2} + (1 - \\epsilon_2) (F_{21}J_1 + F_{22}J_2 + F_{23}J_3)$\n3. $J_3 = \\epsilon_3 E_{b,3} + (1 - \\epsilon_3) (F_{31}J_1 + F_{32}J_2 + F_{33}J_3)$\n\nA critical simplification arises from the fact that surface $3$ is a blackbody, meaning its emissivity $\\epsilon_3 = 1$. Substituting this into the equation for $J_3$:\n$$J_3 = (1) E_{b,3} + (1 - 1) H_3 = E_{b,3}$$\nThis demonstrates that the radiosity of a black surface is equal to its blackbody emissive power. Since $T_3$ is known, $J_3$ is not an unknown variable but a known constant. The system of three unknowns $(J_1, J_2, J_3)$ reduces to a system of two unknowns $(J_1, J_2)$.\n\nFirst, we calculate the blackbody emissive powers:\n$E_{b,1} = \\sigma T_1^4 = (5.670374419\\times 10^{-8}) (800)^4 \\approx 23224.3\\,\\mathrm{W/m^2}$\n$E_{b,2} = \\sigma T_2^4 = (5.670374419\\times 10^{-8}) (500)^4 \\approx 3544.0\\,\\mathrm{W/m^2}$\n$J_3 = E_{b,3} = \\sigma T_3^4 = (5.670374419\\times 10^{-8}) (300)^4 \\approx 459.3\\,\\mathrm{W/m^2}$\n\nNow, we formulate the reduced system of two linear equations for $J_1$ and $J_2$ using the given view factors and properties:\nFor surface 1 ($F_{11}=0, F_{12}=0.5, F_{13}=0.5, \\epsilon_1=0.6$):\n$$J_1 = \\epsilon_1 E_{b,1} + (1 - \\epsilon_1) (F_{12}J_2 + F_{13}J_3)$$\n$$J_1 = (0.6)(23224.3) + (0.4) (0.5 J_2 + 0.5 \\times 459.3)$$\n$$J_1 = 13934.6 + 0.2 J_2 + 91.86$$\n$$J_1 - 0.2 J_2 = 14026.46 \\quad (I)$$\n\nFor surface 2 ($F_{21}=0.5, F_{22}=0, F_{23}=0.5, \\epsilon_2=0.8$):\n$$J_2 = \\epsilon_2 E_{b,2} + (1 - \\epsilon_2) (F_{21}J_1 + F_{23}J_3)$$\n$$J_2 = (0.8)(3544.0) + (0.2) (0.5 J_1 + 0.5 \\times 459.3)$$\n$$J_2 = 2835.2 + 0.1 J_1 + 45.93$$\n$$-0.1 J_1 + J_2 = 2881.13 \\quad (II)$$\n\nWe solve this system. From $(II)$, $J_2 = 2881.13 + 0.1 J_1$. Substitute this into $(I)$:\n$$J_1 - 0.2 (2881.13 + 0.1 J_1) = 14026.46$$\n$$J_1 - 576.226 - 0.02 J_1 = 14026.46$$\n$$0.98 J_1 = 14602.686$$\n$$J_1 = \\frac{14602.686}{0.98} \\approx 14900.7\\,\\mathrm{W/m^2}$$\nNow find $J_2$:\n$$J_2 = 2881.13 + 0.1 (14900.7) = 2881.13 + 1490.07 = 4371.2\\,\\mathrm{W/m^2}$$\n\nThe net radiative heat rate from surface $1$ is given by $Q_1 = A_1 (J_1 - H_1)$. First, we calculate the irradiation $H_1$:\n$$H_1 = F_{12}J_2 + F_{13}J_3 = (0.5)(4371.2) + (0.5)(459.3) = 2185.6 + 229.65 = 2415.25\\,\\mathrm{W/m^2}$$\nNow, calculate $Q_1$:\n$$Q_1 = A_1 (J_1 - H_1) = (2\\,\\mathrm{m}^2) (14900.7 - 2415.25)\\,\\mathrm{W/m^2} = 2 \\times 12485.45\\,\\mathrm{W} = 24970.9\\,\\mathrm{W}$$\nThis can be expressed as $Q_1 \\approx 2.50 \\times 10^4\\,\\mathrm{W}$.\nSince $Q_1 > 0$, the net heat transfer is *away from*, or *leaving*, surface $1$.\n\n**Option-by-Option Analysis**\n\nA.

A full, reasoned solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution Derivations and Algorithm Design\n\nThe task is addressed sequentially as requested.\n\n**1) Derivation of the Linear System for Radiosity**\n\nThe analysis begins with the definition of radiosity, $J_i$:\n$$J_i = \\epsilon_i(T_i)\\,\\sigma T_i^4 + (1 - \\epsilon_i(T_i)) G_i$$\nThe irradiation $G_i$ is expressed in terms of the radiosities of all surfaces in the enclosure:\n$$G_i = \\sum_{j=1}^{N} F_{ij} J_j$$\nSubstituting the expression for $G_i$ into the radiosity definition yields:\n$$J_i = \\epsilon_i(T_i)\\,\\sigma T_i^4 + (1 - \\epsilon_i(T_i)) \\sum_{j=1}^{N} F_{ij} J_j$$\nTo formulate a linear system for the radiosity vector $\\mathbf{J} = (J_1, \\dots, J_N)^\\top$, terms involving $J_j$ are collected on the left-hand side:\n$$J_i - (1 - \\epsilon_i(T_i)) \\sum_{j=1}^{N} F_{ij} J_j = \\epsilon_i(T_i)\\,\\sigma T_i^4$$\nThis equation can be written using the Kronecker delta, $\\delta_{ij}$:\n$$\\sum_{j=1}^{N} \\delta_{ij} J_j - \\sum_{j=1}^{N} (1 - \\epsilon_i(T_i)) F_{ij} J_j = \\epsilon_i(T_i)\\,\\sigma T_i^4$$\nCombining the sums gives a system of $N$ linear equations for $N$ unknown radiosities:\n$$\\sum_{j=1}^{N} \\left( \\delta_{ij} - (1 - \\epsilon_i(T_i)) F_{ij} \\right) J_j = \\epsilon_i(T_i)\\,\\sigma T_i^4$$\nThis is the linear system $\\mathbf{A}(\\mathbf{T}) \\mathbf{J} = \\mathbf{b}(\\mathbf{T})$, where the entries of the matrix $\\mathbf{A}(\\mathbf{T})$ and vector $\\mathbf{b}(\\mathbf{T})$ are:\n$$A_{ij}(\\mathbf{T}) = \\delta_{ij} - (1 - \\epsilon_i(T_i)) F_{ij}$$\n$$b_i(\\mathbf{T}) = \\epsilon_i(T_i) \\sigma T_i^4$$\nFor a given temperature vector $\\mathbf{T}$, this system can be solved to find the radiosity vector $\\mathbf{J}$.\n\n**2) Formulation of the Nonlinear Residual System**\n\nThe net radiative heat flux leaving surface $i$, $q_{r,i}$, is the difference between its radiosity and irradiation:\n$$q_{r,i} = J_i - G_i = J_i - \\sum_{j=1}^{N} F_{ij} J_j$$\nThis can be written as:\n$$q_{r,i} = \\sum_{j=1}^{N} (\\delta_{ij} - F_{ij}) J_j$$\nIn matrix form, with $\\mathbf{q}_r = (q_{r,1}, \\dots, q_{r,N})^\\top$ and $\\mathbf{M} = \\mathbf{I} - \\mathbf{F}$, this is:\n$$\\mathbf{q}_r = \\mathbf{M} \\mathbf{J}$$\nFor each surface $i \\in \\mathcal{U}$ where the temperature is unknown, the steady-state energy balance must hold:\n$$s_i = q_{c,i} + q_{r,i}$$\nwhere $q_{c,i} = h_i(T_i - T_{\\infty,i})$.\nA residual function $R_i$ for each $i \\in \\mathcal{U}$ is defined such that $R_i=0$ at the solution:\n$$R_i(\\mathbf{T}_{\\mathcal{U}}) = s_i - q_{c,i} - q_{r,i} = s_i - h_i(T_i - T_{\\infty,i}) - (\\mathbf{M} \\mathbf{J})_i$$\nHere, $\\mathbf{J}$ is implicitly a function of the temperature vector $\\mathbf{T}$ through the solution of the radiosity system, $\\mathbf{J}(\\mathbf{T}) = \\mathbf{A}(\\mathbf{T})^{-1} \\mathbf{b}(\\mathbf{T})$. The temperature vector $\\mathbf{T}$ includes both the unknown temperatures $\\mathbf{T}_{\\mathcal{U}}$ and any specified, fixed temperatures. The set of equations $R_i(\\mathbf{T}_{\\mathcal{U}}) = 0$ for all $i \\in \\mathcal{U}$ forms a system of nonlinear equations for the unknown temperatures $\\mathbf{T}_{\\mathcal{U}}$.\n\n**3) Derivation of the Jacobian**\n\nTo apply Newton's method, the Jacobian matrix $\\mathcal{J}$ of the residual vector $\\mathbf{R}$ with respect to the unknown temperatures $\\mathbf{T}_{\\mathcal{U}}$ is required. The entries of this Jacobian are $\\mathcal{J}_{ik} = \\dfrac{\\partial R_i}{\\partial T_k}$ for $i, k \\in \\mathcal{U}$.\nStarting with the definition of $R_i$:\n$$\\dfrac{\\partial R_i}{\\partial T_k} = \\dfrac{\\partial}{\\partial T_k} \\left( s_i - h_i(T_i - T_{\\infty,i}) - \\sum_{j=1}^{N} M_{ij} J_j(\\mathbf{T}) \\right)$$\nSince $s_i$, $h_i$, $T_{\\infty,i}$, and $M_{ij}$ are independent of the variable temperatures being solved for:\n$$\\dfrac{\\partial R_i}{\\partial T_k} = -h_i \\delta_{ik} - \\sum_{j=1}^{N} M_{ij} \\dfrac{\\partial J_j}{\\partial T_k}$$\nTo find the partial derivative $\\dfrac{\\partial \\mathbf{J}}{\\partial T_k}$, we differentiate the radiosity system $\\mathbf{A}(\\mathbf{T}) \\mathbf{J}(\\mathbf{T}) = \\mathbf{b}(\\mathbf{T})$ with respect to $T_k$ using the product rule:\n$$\\dfrac{\\partial \\mathbf{A}}{\\partial T_k} \\mathbf{J} + \\mathbf{A} \\dfrac{\\partial \\mathbf{J}}{\\partial T_k} = \\dfrac{\\partial \\mathbf{b}}{\\partial T_k}$$\nSolving for $\\dfrac{\\partial \\mathbf{J}}{\\partial T_k}$ gives:\n$$\\dfrac{\\partial \\mathbf{J}}{\\partial T_k} = \\mathbf{A}^{-1} \\left( \\dfrac{\\partial \\mathbf{b}}{\\partial T_k} - \\dfrac{\\partial \\mathbf{A}}{\\partial T_k} \\mathbf{J} \\right)$$\nThe derivatives of $\\mathbf{A}$ and $\\mathbf{b}$ are needed. First, the derivative of emissivity is $\\dfrac{d\\epsilon_i}{dT_i} = a_i$, so $\\dfrac{\\partial \\epsilon_i}{\\partial T_k} = a_i \\delta_{ik}$.\nThe entries of $\\dfrac{\\partial \\mathbf{A}}{\\partial T_k}$ are:\n$$\\left( \\dfrac{\\partial \\mathbf{A}}{\\partial T_k} \\right)_{mj} = \\dfrac{\\partial A_{mj}}{\\partial T_k} = \\dfrac{\\partial}{\\partial T_k} \\left( \\delta_{mj} - (1 - \\epsilon_m(T_m)) F_{mj} \\right) = F_{mj} \\dfrac{\\partial \\epsilon_m}{\\partial T_k} = F_{mj} a_m \\delta_{mk}$$\nThe vector $\\dfrac{\\partial \\mathbf{A}}{\\partial T_k} \\mathbf{J}$ has entries:\n$$\\left( \\dfrac{\\partial \\mathbf{A}}{\\partial T_k} \\mathbf{J} \\right)_m = \\sum_{j=1}^{N} (F_{mj} a_m \\delta_{mk}) J_j = \\delta_{mk} a_k \\sum_{j=1}^{N} F_{kj} J_j = \\delta_{mk} a_k G_k$$\nThus, $\\dfrac{\\partial \\mathbf{A}}{\\partial T_k} \\mathbf{J}$ is a vector with zeros everywhere except for the $k$-th element, which is $a_k G_k$. This can be written as $a_k G_k \\mathbf{e}_k$, where $\\mathbf{e}_k$ is the $k$-th standard basis vector.\nThe entries of $\\dfrac{\\partial \\mathbf{b}}{\\partial T_k}$ are:\n$$\\left( \\dfrac{\\partial \\mathbf{b}}{\\partial T_k} \\right)_m = \\dfrac{\\partial b_m}{\\partial T_k} = \\dfrac{\\partial}{\\partial T_k} (\\epsilon_m(T_m) \\sigma T_m^4) = \\sigma \\left( \\dfrac{\\partial \\epsilon_m}{\\partial T_k} T_m^4 + \\epsilon_m \\dfrac{\\partial T_m^4}{\\partial T_k} \\right) = \\sigma (a_m \\delta_{mk} T_m^4 + \\epsilon_m 4 T_m^3 \\delta_{mk})$$\nThis simplifies to $\\delta_{mk} \\sigma (a_k T_k^4 + 4 \\epsilon_k T_k^3)$. Thus, $\\dfrac{\\partial \\mathbf{b}}{\\partial T_k} = \\sigma (a_k T_k^4 + 4 \\epsilon_k T_k^3) \\mathbf{e}_k$.\nSubstituting these derivatives back:\n$$\\dfrac{\\partial \\mathbf{J}}{\\partial T_k} = \\mathbf{A}^{-1} \\left( \\sigma (a_k T_k^4 + 4 \\epsilon_k T_k^3) \\mathbf{e}_k - a_k G_k \\mathbf{e}_k \\right) = \\mathbf{A}^{-1} \\left( a_k (\\sigma T_k^4 - G_k) + 4 \\sigma \\epsilon_k T_k^3 \\right) \\mathbf{e}_k$$\nFrom the radiosity definition, $q_{r,k} = J_k - G_k = \\epsilon_k(\\sigma T_k^4 - G_k)$, which implies $\\sigma T_k^4 - G_k = q_{r,k}/\\epsilon_k$.\nLet $C_k = \\dfrac{a_k}{\\epsilon_k} q_{r,k} + 4 \\sigma \\epsilon_k T_k^3$. The expression for the derivative of the radiosity vector simplifies to:\n$$\\dfrac{\\partial \\mathbf{J}}{\\partial T_k} = C_k \\mathbf{A}^{-1} \\mathbf{e}_k$$\nThis vector is the $k$-th column of $\\mathbf{A}^{-1}$ scaled by the scalar $C_k$.\nFinally, the Jacobian entry $\\mathcal{J}_{ik}$ is:\n$$\\mathcal{J}_{ik} = -h_i \\delta_{ik} - \\sum_{j=1}^{N} M_{ij} (C_k (\\mathbf{A}^{-1})_{jk}) = -h_i \\delta_{ik} - C_k (\\mathbf{M} \\mathbf{A}^{-1})_{ik}$$\nwhere $(\\mathbf{M} \\mathbf{A}^{-1})_{ik}$ is the $(i,k)$-th entry of the matrix product $\\mathbf{M}\\mathbf{A}^{-1}$. This formula allows for the analytical computation of the Jacobian.\n\n**4) Newton Iteration Scheme**\n\nTo solve the nonlinear system $\\mathbf{R}(\\mathbf{T}_{\\mathcal{U}}) = \\mathbf{0}$, a Newton-Raphson method is employed.\nLet $\\mathbf{T}_{unk}$ be the vector of unknown temperatures, corresponding to indices in $\\mathcal{U}$. At iteration $m$, the update $\\Delta \\mathbf{T}_{unk}^{(m)}$ is found by solving the linear system:\n$$\\mathcal{J}(\\mathbf{T}_{unk}^{(m)}) \\Delta \\mathbf{T}_{unk}^{(m)} = -\\mathbf{R}(\\mathbf{T}_{unk}^{(m)})$$\nwhere $\\mathcal{J}$ is the Jacobian matrix derived in part (3), evaluated at the current temperature estimate $\\mathbf{T}_{unk}^{(m)}$.\n-   **Update Rule:** The new temperature estimate is $\\mathbf{T}_{unk}^{(m+1)} = \\mathbf{T}_{unk}^{(m)} + \\alpha^{(m)} \\Delta \\mathbf{T}_{unk}^{(m)}$.\n-   **Initialization:** The iteration starts from a given initial guess $\\mathbf{T}_{unk}^{(0)}$.\n-   **Globalization Strategy:** A backtracking line search is used to determine the step size $\\alpha^{(m)} \\in (0, 1]$. This strategy ensures that each step produces a sufficient decrease in the norm of the residual, which improves the robustness and global convergence properties of the method. The procedure is as follows:\n    1.  Start with a full step, $\\alpha = 1$.\n    2.  Calculate the proposed next state $\\mathbf{T}_{next} = \\mathbf{T}_{unk}^{(m)} + \\alpha \\Delta \\mathbf{T}_{unk}^{(m)}$.\n    3.  Evaluate the residual norm at this new state, $\\|\\mathbf{R}(\\mathbf{T}_{next})\\|_2$.\n    4.  If $\\|\\mathbf{R}(\\mathbf{T}_{next})\\|_2 < \\|\\mathbf{R}(\\mathbf{T}_{unk}^{(m)})\\|_2$, the step is accepted.\n    5.  Otherwise, $\\alpha$ is reduced (e.g., $\\alpha \\leftarrow \\alpha/2$) and steps 2-4 are repeated until the condition is met or a minimum step size is reached.\n\nThe overall algorithm for each Newton step is:\n1.  Using the current temperature vector $\\mathbf{T}^{(m)}$, compute all $\\epsilon_i(T_i)$.\n2.  Assemble the radiosity system matrix $\\mathbf{A}$ and vector $\\mathbf{b}$.\n3.  Solve $\\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{J} = \\mathbf{b}$ for the radiosity vector $\\mathbf{J}$.\n4.  Compute $\\mathbf{q}_r = (\\mathbf{I}-\\mathbf{F})\\mathbf{J}$ and $\\mathbf{G} = \\mathbf{F}\\mathbf{J}$.\n5.  Assemble the residual vector $\\mathbf{R}$ for all $i \\in \\mathcal{U}$.\n6.  Check for convergence (e.g., $\\|\\mathbf{R}\\|_2 < \\mathrm{tolerance}$). If converged, stop.\n7.  Compute the Jacobian matrix $\\mathcal{J}$.
