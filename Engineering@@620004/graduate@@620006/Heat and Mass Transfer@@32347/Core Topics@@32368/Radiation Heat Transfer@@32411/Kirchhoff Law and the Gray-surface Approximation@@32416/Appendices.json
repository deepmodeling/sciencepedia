It is a standard problem in the field of heat and mass transfer, specifically concerning radiation heat exchange between two surfaces. We shall proceed with the derivation.\n\nThe analysis begins with the radiosity-irradiation formulation for opaque, diffuse-gray surfaces. The radiosity, $J$, of a surface is the total radiative flux per unit area leaving the surface, which is the sum of its emitted and reflected flux. For a surface $i$, this is expressed as:\n$$J_{i} = E_{i} + \\rho_{i} G_{i}$$\nwhere $E_{i}$ is the emissive power, $\\rho_{i}$ is the reflectivity, and $G_{i}$ is the irradiation (incident flux per unit area).\n\nAccording to the Stefan–Boltzmann law, the emissive power of a gray surface is $E_{i} = \\varepsilon_{i} \\sigma T_{i}^{4}$, where $\\varepsilon_{i}$ is the emissivity, $\\sigma$ is the Stefan–Boltzmann constant, and $T_{i}$ is the absolute temperature.\n\nFor an opaque surface, the sum of absorptivity ($\\alpha_{i}$) and reflectivity ($\\rho_{i}$) is unity: $\\alpha_{i} + \\rho_{i} = 1$. By Kirchhoff's law of thermal radiation, for a surface in thermal equilibrium with its surroundings (which is extendable to non-equilibrium cases for the gray-surface approximation), the absorptivity is equal to the emissivity: $\\alpha_{i} = \\varepsilon_{i}$. Therefore, the reflectivity is $\\rho_{i} = 1 - \\varepsilon_{i}$.\n\nSubstituting these relations into the radiosity equation, we obtain:\n$$J_{i} = \\varepsilon_{i} \\sigma T_{i}^{4} + (1 - \\varepsilon_{i}) G_{i}$$\n\nWe can now write the radiosity equations for the two plates, designated as plate $1$ and plate $2$:\n$$J_{1} = \\varepsilon_{1} \\sigma T_{1}^{4} + (1 - \\varepsilon_{1}) G_{1} \\quad (1)$$\n$$J_{2} = \\varepsilon_{2} \\sigma T_{2}^{4} + (1 - \\varepsilon_{2}) G_{2} \\quad (2)$$\n\nThe problem states that the plates are \"very large\" and \"parallel,\" and \"view only each other.\" This is an idealization that implies the view factor from plate $1$ to plate $2$ is $F_{12} = 1$, and similarly, $F_{21} = 1$. Consequently, all radiation leaving plate $2$ is intercepted by plate $1$, and vice versa. This means the irradiation on plate $1$ is equal to the radiosity of plate $2$, and the irradiation on plate $2$ is equal to the radiosity of plate $1$:\n$$G_{1} = J_{2}$$\n$$G_{2} = J_{1}$$\n\nSubstituting these relations into equations (1) and (2) yields a system of two linear algebraic equations for the unknown radiosities $J_{1}$ and $J_{2}$:\n$$J_{1} = \\varepsilon_{1} \\sigma T_{1}^{4} + (1 - \\varepsilon_{1}) J_{2} \\quad (3)$$\n$$J_{2} = \\varepsilon_{2} \\sigma T_{2}^{4} + (1 - \\varepsilon_{2}) J_{1} \\quad (4)$$\n\nTo solve this system, we can substitute equation (4) into equation (3):\n$$J_{1} = \\varepsilon_{1} \\sigma T_{1}^{4} + (1 - \\varepsilon_{1}) [\\varepsilon_{2} \\sigma T_{2}^{4} + (1 - \\varepsilon_{2}) J_{1}]$$\n$$J_{1} = \\varepsilon_{1} \\sigma T_{1}^{4} + (1 - \\varepsilon_{1})\\varepsilon_{2} \\sigma T_{2}^{4} + (1 - \\varepsilon_{1})(1 - \\varepsilon_{2}) J_{1}$$\n$$J_{1} [1 - (1 - \\varepsilon_{1})(1 - \\varepsilon_{2})] = \\varepsilon_{1} \\sigma T_{1}^{4} + \\varepsilon_{2}(1 - \\varepsilon_{1}) \\sigma T_{2}^{4}$$\nThe term in the square brackets simplifies as:\n$$1 - (1 - \\varepsilon_{1} - \\varepsilon_{2} + \\varepsilon_{1}\\varepsilon_{2}) = \\varepsilon_{1} + \\varepsilon_{2} - \\varepsilon_{1}\\varepsilon_{2}$$\nSo, we can solve for $J_{1}$:\n$$J_{1} = \\frac{\\varepsilon_{1} \\sigma T_{1}^{4} + \\varepsilon_{2}(1 - \\varepsilon_{1}) \\sigma T_{2}^{4}}{\\varepsilon_{1} + \\varepsilon_{2} - \\varepsilon_{1}\\varepsilon_{2}}$$\nBy symmetry, we can find $J_{2}$ by swapping indices $1$ and $2$:\n$$J_{2} = \\frac{\\varepsilon_{2} \\sigma T_{2}^{4} + \\varepsilon_{1}(1 - \\varepsilon_{2}) \\sigma T_{1}^{4}}{\\varepsilon_{1} + \\varepsilon_{2} - \\varepsilon_{1}\\varepsilon_{2}}$$\n\nThe net radiative heat flux per unit area, $q''$, from plate $1$ to plate $2$ is the difference between the radiation leaving plate $1$ (its radiosity $J_{1}$) and the radiation incident upon it (its irradiation $G_{1}$).\n$$q'' = J_{1} - G_{1} = J_{1} - J_{2}$$\nSubstituting the expressions for $J_{1}$ and $J_{2}$:\n$$q'' = \\frac{1}{\\varepsilon_{1} + \\varepsilon_{2} - \\varepsilon_{1}\\varepsilon_{2}} \\left[ (\\varepsilon_{1} \\sigma T_{1}^{4} + \\varepsilon_{2}(1 - \\varepsilon_{1}) \\sigma T_{2}^{4}) - (\\varepsilon_{2} \\sigma T_{2}^{4} + \\varepsilon_{1}(1 - \\varepsilon_{2}) \\sigma T_{1}^{4}) \\right]$$\nExpanding and collecting terms:\n$$q'' = \\frac{\\sigma}{\\varepsilon_{1} + \\varepsilon_{2} - \\varepsilon_{1}\\varepsilon_{2}} [ \\varepsilon_{1} T_{1}^{4} + \\varepsilon_{2} T_{2}^{4} - \\varepsilon_{1}\\varepsilon_{2}T_{2}^{4} - \\varepsilon_{2} T_{2}^{4} - \\varepsilon_{1} T_{1}^{4} + \\varepsilon_{1}\\varepsilon_{2}T_{1}^{4} ]$$\n$$q'' = \\frac{\\sigma}{\\varepsilon_{1} + \\varepsilon_{2} - \\varepsilon_{1}\\varepsilon_{2}} [ \\varepsilon_{1}\\varepsilon_{2}T_{1}^{4} - \\varepsilon_{1}\\varepsilon_{2}T_{2}^{4} ]$$\n$$q'' = \\frac{\\varepsilon_{1}\\varepsilon_{2} \\sigma (T_{1}^{4} - T_{2}^{4})}{\\varepsilon_{1} + \\varepsilon_{2} - \\varepsilon_{1}\\varepsilon_{2}}$$\nDividing the numerator and denominator by $\\varepsilon_{1}\\varepsilon_{2}$ yields the familiar form based on the thermal resistance analogy:\n$$q'' = \\frac{\\sigma (T_{1}^{4} - T_{2}^{4})}{\\frac{1}{\\varepsilon_{1}} + \\frac{1}{\\varepsilon_{2}} - 1}$$\nThis is the exact expression for the net radiative heat flux per unit area between the two plates.\n\nThe next step is to linearize this expression for a small temperature difference.

The derivative is $f'(T) = 4T^{3}$.\nThus,\n$$T_{1}^{4} \\approx T_{0}^{4} + 4T_{0}^{3}(T_{1} - T_{0}) = T_{0}^{4} + 4T_{0}^{3}\\Delta T$$\n$$T_{2}^{4} \\approx T_{0}^{4} + 4T_{0}^{3}(T_{2} - T_{0}) = T_{0}^{4} - 4T_{0}^{3}\\Delta T$$\nThe difference is then:\n$$T_{1}^{4} - T_{2}^{4} \\approx (T_{0}^{4} + 4T_{0}^{3}\\Delta T) - (T_{0}^{4} - 4T_{0}^{3}\\Delta T) = 8T_{0}^{3}\\Delta T$$\nThe temperature difference between the plates is $T_{1} - T_{2} = (T_{0} + \\Delta T) - (T_{0} - \\Delta T) = 2\\Delta T$.\nTherefore, we can express the linearized term as:\n$$T_{1}^{4} - T_{2}^{4} \\approx 4T_{0}^{3} (2\\Delta T) = 4T_{0}^{3}(T_{1} - T_{2})$$\nSubstituting this linear approximation into the exact expression for $q''$:\n$$q'' \\approx \\frac{\\sigma \\left[ 4T_{0}^{3}(T_{1} - T_{2}) \\right]}{\\frac{1}{\\varepsilon_{1}} + \\frac{1}{\\varepsilon_{2}} - 1}$$\nThe problem requires this to be of the form $q'' \\approx g_{\\mathrm{rad}}(T_{1} - T_{2})$.

The premises are consistent with the fundamental principles of radiative heat transfer.

The net radiative heat rate leaving the small patch, denoted $Q_{p}$, is the product of its area $dA$ and the net radiative heat flux from its surface, $q''_{p}$.\n$$Q_{p} = q''_{p} dA$$\nThe net heat flux $q''_{p}$ is the difference between the total radiation leaving the surface per unit area (its radiosity, $J_{p}$) and the total radiation incident on the surface per unit area (its irradiation, $G_{p}$).\n$$q''_{p} = J_{p} - G_{p}$$\nFor an opaque, diffuse-gray surface, the radiosity $J_{p}$ is the sum of its emitted radiation and the reflected portion of the incident radiation.\n$$J_{p} = E_{p} + \\rho_{p} G_{p}$$\nThe emissive power of the patch is $E_{p} = \\varepsilon_{p} E_{bp} = \\varepsilon_{p} \\sigma T_{p}^{4}$, where $\\varepsilon_{p}$ is the emissivity of the patch, $T_{p}$ is its absolute temperature, and $\\sigma$ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.

The problem states that the patch is sufficiently small that it does not perturb the global radiative exchange between the two large plates, $A$ and $B$. This signifies that the irradiation field at the location of the patch is determined by the large-scale interaction between plates $A$ and $B$ only. The patch is located on plate $A$, so its irradiation is the same as that of plate $A$, $G_{p} = G_{A}$.\n\nThe plates $A$ and $B$ are very large, parallel planes.

The irradiation, $G$, on the tube surface is equal to the blackbody emissive power of the enclosure, $G = E_{b,c} = \\sigma T_{c}^{4}$.\n\nThe radiation absorbed by the tube surface is $\\alpha_{h} G = \\alpha_{h} \\sigma T_{c}^{4}$, where $\\alpha_{h}$ is the total hemispherical absorptivity of the surface. This absorptivity is for radiation originating from a source at temperature $T_{c}$ and being absorbed by the surface at temperature $T_{h}$.\n\nTherefore, the true net radiative heat loss per unit area is:\n$$ q_{\\mathrm{true}} = \\varepsilon_{h}(T_{h}) \\sigma T_{h}^{4} - \\alpha_{h}(T_{h}, T_{c}) \\sigma T_{c}^{4} $$\n\nThe total hemispherical properties are obtained by integrating the spectral properties over the appropriate blackbody spectrum. The total hemispherical emissivity $\\varepsilon_{h}(T_{h})$ is defined by weighting the spectral emissivity $\\varepsilon_{\\lambda}(T_{h})$ with the blackbody spectral emissive power, $E_{b,\\lambda}(T_{h})$, at the surface temperature $T_{h}$:\n$$ \\varepsilon_{h}(T_{h}) = \\frac{\\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\varepsilon_{\\lambda}(T_{h}) E_{b,\\lambda}(T_{h}) d\\lambda}{\\int_{0}^{\\infty} E_{b,\\lambda}(T_{h}) d\\lambda} = \\frac{\\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\varepsilon_{\\lambda}(T_{h}) E_{b,\\lambda}(T_{h}) d\\lambda}{\\sigma T_{h}^{4}} $$\nThe total hemispherical absorptivity $\\alpha_{h}(T_{h}, T_{c})$ is defined by weighting the spectral absorptivity $\\alpha_{\\lambda}(T_{h})$ with the spectral emissive power of the incident radiation, which is from a blackbody at $T_{c}$, namely $E_{b,\\lambda}(T_{c})$. Using Kirchhoff's law for a diffuse surface, $\\alpha_{\\lambda}(T_{h}) = \\varepsilon_{\\lambda}(T_{h})$, we have:\n$$ \\alpha_{h}(T_{h}, T_{c}) = \\frac{\\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\alpha_{\\lambda}(T_{h}) E_{b,\\lambda}(T_{c}) d\\lambda}{\\int_{0}^{\\infty} E_{b,\\lambda}(T_{c}) d\\lambda} = \\frac{\\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\varepsilon_{\\lambda}(T_{h}) E_{b,\\lambda}(T_{c}) d\\lambda}{\\sigma T_{c}^{4}} $$\nCombining these gives the formally exact expression for the net heat loss:\n$$ q_{\\mathrm{true}} = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\varepsilon_{\\lambda}(T_h) E_{b,\\lambda}(T_h) d\\lambda - \\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\varepsilon_{\\lambda}(T_h) E_{b,\\lambda}(T_c) d\\lambda $$\nThe gray-surface approximation assumes $\\varepsilon_{\\lambda}$ is constant with wavelength, $\\varepsilon_{\\lambda} = \\varepsilon$. Under this assumption, $\\varepsilon_{h} = \\varepsilon$ and $\\alpha_{h} = \\varepsilon$. The designer uses $\\varepsilon = \\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{RT}}$. The predicted heat loss is thus:\n$$ q_{\\mathrm{pred}} = \\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{RT}} \\sigma (T_{h}^{4} - T_{c}^{4}) $$\nThis shows how the assumption simplifies the formulation.\n\nNow we compute the terms for $q_{\\mathrm{true}}$.\nThe total hemispherical emissivity at $T_{h} = 1200\\ \\mathrm{K}$ is calculated using the given piecewise $\\varepsilon_{\\lambda}(T_h)$ and the blackbody band fraction. Let the cutoff wavelength be $\\lambda_{co} = 1.5\\ \\mu\\mathrm{m}$.\n$$ \\varepsilon_{h}(T_{h}) = \\varepsilon_{\\lambda,1} \\int_{0}^{\\lambda_{co}} \\frac{E_{b,\\lambda}(T_{h})}{\\sigma T_{h}^{4}} d\\lambda + \\varepsilon_{\\lambda,2} \\int_{\\lambda_{co}}^{\\infty} \\frac{E_{b,\\lambda}(T_{h})}{\\sigma T_{h}^{4}} d\\lambda $$\nwhere $\\varepsilon_{\\lambda,1}=0.25$ and $\\varepsilon_{\\lambda,2}=0.80$. The second integral corresponds to the given fraction $f_{h} = 0.80$. The first integral is thus $1 - f_{h} = 1 - 0.80 = 0.20$.\n$$ \\varepsilon_{h}(T_{h}) = (0.25)(1 - f_{h}) + (0.80)(f_{h}) = (0.25)(0.20) + (0.80)(0.80) = 0.05 + 0.64 = 0.69 $$\nThe total hemispherical absorptivity for radiation from $T_{c}=300\\ \\mathrm{K}$ is:\n$$ \\alpha_{h}(T_{h}, T_{c}) = (0.25) F_{0-\\lambda_{co}}(T_{c}) + (0.80) [1 - F_{0-\\lambda_{co}}(T_{c})] $$\nwhere $F_{0-\\lambda_{co}}(T_{c})$ is the fraction of blackbody radiation at $T_c$ emitted in the band $0 \\le \\lambda \\le \\lambda_{co}$. We evaluate the product $\\lambda_{co}T_{c} = (1.5\\ \\mu\\mathrm{m})(300\\ \\mathrm{K}) = 450\\ \\mu\\mathrm{m}\\cdot\\mathrm{K}$. For such a small value of $\\lambda T$, the fraction of emitted energy is negligible. Wien's displacement law, $\\lambda_{\\max}T \\approx 2898\\ \\mu\\mathrm{m}\\cdot\\mathrm{K}$, indicates that the peak of emission for a $300\\ \\mathrm{K}$ blackbody is at $\\lambda_{\\max} \\approx 9.7\\ \\mu\\mathrm{m}$. Almost all energy is emitted at wavelengths much larger than $1.5\\ \\mu\\mathrm{m}$. Thus, we can approximate $F_{0-1.5\\mu\\mathrm{m}}(300\\ \\mathrm{K}) \\approx 0$.\n$$ \\alpha_{h}(T_{h}, T_{c}) \\approx (0.25)(0) + (0.80)(1 - 0) = 0.80 $$\nThe true net heat loss is:\n$$ q_{\\mathrm{true}} = (0.69) \\sigma T_{h}^{4} - (0.80) \\sigma T_{c}^{4} $$\n\nThe contribution of absorbed radiation to the net flux, relative to the emitted radiation, is $\\frac{\\alpha_h T_c^4}{\\varepsilon_h T_h^4} = \\frac{0.80}{0.69} (\\frac{300}{1200})^4 \\approx 0.0045$, or about $0.45\\%$. While this term is small, we retain it for maximum accuracy as is befitting a rigorous analysis.\n\nThe predicted net heat loss using the gray-surface model with $\\varepsilon=\\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{RT}}=0.10$ is:\n$$ q_{\\mathrm{pred}} = (0.10) \\sigma (T_{h}^{4} - T_{c}^{4}) $$\n\nThe ratio $R$ is therefore:\n$$ R = \\frac{q_{\\mathrm{pred}}}{q_{\\mathrm{true}}} = \\frac{0.10 \\sigma (T_{h}^{4} - T_{c}^{4})}{0.69 \\sigma T_{h}^{4} - 0.80 \\sigma T_{c}^{4}} = \\frac{0.10 (T_{h}^{4} - T_{c}^{4})}{0.69 T_{h}^{4} - 0.80 T_{c}^{4}} $$\nSubstituting $T_{h} = 1200\\ \\mathrm{K}$ and $T_{c} = 300\\ \\mathrm{K}$, we note that $T_{h} = 4T_{c}$, so $T_{h}^{4} = (4T_{c})^{4} = 256 T_{c}^{4}$.\n$$ R = \\frac{0.10 (256 T_{c}^{4} - T_{c}^{4})}{0.69 (256 T_{c}^{4}) - 0.80 T_{c}^{4}} $$\nThe term $T_{c}^{4}$ cancels out:\n$$ R = \\frac{0.10 (256 - 1)}{0.69(256) - 0.80} = \\frac{0.10(255)}{176.64 - 0.80} = \\frac{25.5}{175.84} $$\n$$ R \\approx 0.145018198... $$\nRounding to three significant figures, the result is $0.145$.
