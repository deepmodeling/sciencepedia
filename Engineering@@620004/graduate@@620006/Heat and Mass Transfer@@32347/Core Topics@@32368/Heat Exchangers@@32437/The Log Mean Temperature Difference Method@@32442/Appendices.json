A solution will be provided.\n\n**Derivation of the Governing Differential Equation**\n\nWe establish a coordinate system where the hot fluid flows in the positive $x$-direction, from $x=0$ to $x=L$. In a countercurrent configuration, the cold fluid must therefore flow in the negative $x$-direction, from $x=L$ to $x=0$.\n\nThe heat transfer across a differential area element $dA = P\\,dx$ is given by the local constitutive relation:\n$$dQ = U (T_h(x) - T_c(x)) P\\,dx = U P \\Delta T(x) \\,dx$$\n\nConservation of energy is applied to each fluid stream over a differential control volume from $x$ to $x+dx$.\n\nFor the hot fluid, flowing in the $+x$ direction, its temperature decreases. The change in its enthalpy equals the heat transferred out:\n$$C_h dT_h = -dQ = -U P \\Delta T(x) \\,dx$$\n$$\\frac{dT_h}{dx} = -\\frac{UP}{C_h} \\Delta T(x)$$\n\nFor the cold fluid, flowing in the $-x$ direction, its temperature increases as it moves from $x=L$ to $x=0$. Applying the energy balance over the same differential element, the change in enthalpy is due to heat transferred in. Considering the direction of flow:\n$C_c T_c(x) - C_c T_c(x+dx) = dQ$\n$$-C_c (T_c(x+dx) - T_c(x)) = U P \\Delta T(x) \\,dx$$\n$$-C_c \\frac{dT_c}{dx} = U P \\Delta T(x)$$\n$$\\frac{dT_c}{dx} = -\\frac{UP}{C_c} \\Delta T(x)$$\n\nThe problem requires a differential equation for $\\Delta T(x) = T_h(x) - T_c(x)$. We differentiate this definition with respect to $x$:\n$$\\frac{d(\\Delta T)}{dx} = \\frac{dT_h}{dx} - \\frac{dT_c}{dx}$$\nSubstituting the expressions derived from the energy balances:\n$$\\frac{d(\\Delta T)}{dx} = \\left(-\\frac{UP}{C_h} \\Delta T(x)\\right) - \\left(-\\frac{UP}{C_c} \\Delta T(x)\\right)$$\n$$\\frac{d(\\Delta T)}{dx} = -UP \\left( \\frac{1}{C_h} - \\frac{1}{C_c} \\right) \\Delta T(x)$$\nThis is the required first-order, linear, homogeneous ordinary differential equation for $\\Delta T(x)$.\n\nTo solve this ODE, we separate variables and integrate:\n$$\\int \\frac{d(\\Delta T)}{\\Delta T} = -UP \\left( \\frac{1}{C_h} - \\frac{1}{C_c} \\right) \\int dx$$\n$$\\ln(\\Delta T(x)) = -UP \\left( \\frac{1}{C_h} - \\frac{1}{C_c} \\right) x + K$$\nwhere $K$ is the constant of integration. Using the boundary condition at $x=0$, $\\Delta T(0) = \\Delta T_1$:\n$$\\ln(\\Delta T_1) = K$$\nThus, the solution for the local temperature difference is:\n$$\\ln\\left(\\frac{\\Delta T(x)}{\\Delta T_1}\\right) = -UP \\left( \\frac{1}{C_h} - \\frac{1}{C_c} \\right) x$$\n$$\\Delta T(x) = \\Delta T_1 \\exp\\left[-UP \\left( \\frac{1}{C_h} - \\frac{1}{C_c} \\right) x\\right]$$\nThis solution satisfies the boundary condition $\\Delta T(0) = \\Delta T_1$.

Substituting the expression for $\\Delta T_{\\mathrm{lm}}$:\n$$\\theta = \\frac{1}{\\Delta T_1} \\left( \\frac{\\Delta T_2 - \\Delta T_1}{\\ln(\\frac{\\Delta T_2}{\\Delta T_1})} \\right) = \\frac{\\frac{\\Delta T_2}{\\Delta T_1} - 1}{\\ln(\\frac{\\Delta T_2}{\\Delta T_1})}$$\nLet $r = \\frac{\\Delta T_2}{\\Delta T_1}$. The expression for $\\theta$ becomes:\n$$\\theta(r) = \\frac{r-1}{\\ln(r)}$$\nWe are required to evaluate the limit of $\\theta$ as $\\Delta T_2 \\to 0^+$, with $\\Delta T_1$ being a fixed positive constant. This corresponds to the limit as $r \\to 0^+$.\n$$\\lim_{\\Delta T_2 \\to 0^+} \\theta = \\lim_{r \\to 0^+} \\frac{r-1}{\\ln(r)}$$\nAs $r \\to 0^+$, the numerator $(r-1)$ approaches $0 - 1 = -1$.\nAs $r \\to 0^+$, the denominator $\\ln(r)$ approaches $-\\infty$.\nTherefore, the limit is:\n$$\\lim_{r \\to 0^+} \\frac{r-1}{\\ln(r)} = \\frac{-1}{-\\infty} = 0$$\n\n**Interpretation of the Result**\n\nThe total heat duty is given by $Q = U A \\Delta T_{\\mathrm{lm}}$. The required heat transfer area $A$ can be expressed as:\n$$A = \\frac{Q}{U \\Delta T_{\\mathrm{lm}}}$$\nUsing the definition of $\\theta$, we have $\\Delta T_{\\mathrm{lm}} = \\theta \\Delta T_1$. Substituting this into the equation for area:\n$$A = \\frac{Q}{U \\theta \\Delta T_1}$$\nThe problem asks for an interpretation of the result in the limit $\\Delta T_2 \\to 0^+$, for a fixed finite heat duty $Q$, a finite overall heat transfer coefficient $U$, and a fixed finite terminal temperature difference $\\Delta T_1$.\nIn this limit, we have found that $\\theta \\to 0$. The expression for the area becomes:\n$$\\lim_{\\theta \\to 0^+} A = \\lim_{\\theta \\to 0^+} \\frac{Q}{U \\Delta T_1} \\frac{1}{\\theta}$$\nSince $Q$, $U$, and $\\Delta T_1$ are all finite and non-zero, as $\\theta \\to 0^+$, the term $\\frac{1}{\\theta} \\to +\\infty$. Consequently, the required heat transfer area $A$ must approach infinity.\n\nPhysically, the condition $\\Delta T_2 \\to 0^+$ signifies that the temperature difference between the two fluids at one end of the exchanger approaches zero. This is known as a thermal \"pinch.\" To achieve a condition where the two fluids reach thermal equilibrium at one end while still transferring a finite amount of heat $Q > 0$ over the exchanger's length, an infinitely large contact area is required.

We shall proceed with the solution based on first principles as requested.\n\nThe governing principles are the steady-flow energy balance for each fluid stream and the rate equation for heat transfer in the exchanger. For a differential area element $dA$, the rate of heat transfer $dQ$ is given by:\n$$dQ = U (T_h - T_c) dA$$\nwhere $U$ is the overall heat transfer coefficient, and $T_h$ and $T_c$ are the local temperatures of the hot and cold fluids, respectively.\n\nThe energy balances for the hot and cold fluids over this differential element are:\n$$dQ = -C_h dT_h$$\n$$dQ = C_c dT_c$$\nwhere $C_h = \\dot{m}_{h} c_{p,h}$ and $C_c = \\dot{m}_{c} c_{p,c}$ are the heat capacity rates of the hot and cold fluids. The negative sign for the hot fluid indicates that its temperature decreases as heat is transferred away from it.\n\nFirst, we calculate the heat capacity rates from the given data:\nFor the hot stream (oil):\n$$C_h = \\dot{m}_{h} c_{p,h} = (2.50\\,\\mathrm{kg}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}) \\times (2.10\\,\\mathrm{kJ}\\,\\mathrm{kg}^{-1}\\,\\mathrm{K}^{-1}) = 5.25\\,\\mathrm{kW}\\,\\mathrm{K}^{-1}$$\nFor the cold stream (water):\n$$C_c = \\dot{m}_{c} c_{p,c} = (1.00\\,\\mathrm{kg}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}) \\times (4.18\\,\\mathrm{kJ}\\,\\mathrm{kg}^{-1}\\,\\mathrm{K}^{-1}) = 4.18\\,\\mathrm{kW}\\,\\mathrm{K}^{-1}$$\nWe observe that $C_c < C_h$. This signifies that for a given amount of heat transfer, the temperature change of the cold fluid will be greater than that of the hot fluid.\n\nTo address Task 1, we must determine where the minimum temperature difference, $\\Delta T(x) = T_h(x) - T_c(x)$, occurs in a counterflow arrangement. Let us set up a coordinate system $x$ starting from $x=0$ at the hot fluid inlet (cold fluid outlet) to $x=L$ at the hot fluid outlet (cold fluid inlet). In this system, the hot fluid flows in the positive $x$ direction, and the cold fluid flows in the negative $x$ direction.\n\nThe change in the local temperature difference $\\Delta T$ with respect to the position coordinate $x$ is:\n$$\\frac{d(\\Delta T)}{dx} = \\frac{dT_h}{dx} - \\frac{dT_c}{dx}$$\nFrom the differential energy balances and the heat transfer rate equation, we can write the temperature gradients. Let $P$ be the heat transfer perimeter such that $dA = P dx$.\n$$\\frac{dT_h}{dx} = -\\frac{UP}{C_h}(T_h - T_c)$$\nFor the cold fluid flowing in the opposite direction, its temperature increases as $x$ decreases. Thus, $\\frac{dT_c}{dx}$ is negative.\n$$\\frac{dT_c}{dx} = -\\frac{UP}{C_c}(T_h - T_c)$$\nSubstituting these into the expression for the gradient of the temperature difference:\n$$\\frac{d(\\Delta T)}{dx} = -\\frac{UP}{C_h}(T_h - T_c) - \\left(-\\frac{UP}{C_c}(T_h - T_c)\\right) = UP(T_h - T_c) \\left(\\frac{1}{C_c} - \\frac{1}{C_h}\\right)$$\nSince $T_h > T_c$ for heat transfer to occur, the term $UP(T_h - T_c)$ is positive. The sign of $\\frac{d(\\Delta T)}{dx}$ is therefore determined by the sign of $(\\frac{1}{C_c} - \\frac{1}{C_h})$, which is equivalent to the sign of $(C_h - C_c)$.\n\nIn this problem, $C_h = 5.25\\,\\mathrm{kW}\\,\\mathrm{K}^{-1}$ and $C_c = 4.18\\,\\mathrm{kW}\\,\\mathrm{K}^{-1}$, so $C_h > C_c$. This makes $\\frac{d(\\Delta T)}{dx}$ positive. A positive derivative means that the temperature difference $\\Delta T$ increases along the $x$-axis from $x=0$ to $x=L$. Consequently, the minimum temperature difference occurs at the start of the coordinate system, $x=0$, which is the end where the hot fluid enters and the cold fluid exits.\n$$\\Delta T_{\\text{min, location}} = \\Delta T_1 = T_{h,\\mathrm{in}} - T_{c,\\mathrm{out}}$$\nThe problem specifies that the minimum allowable temperature approach is $\\Delta T_{\\min} = 10\\,\\mathrm{K}$.

It presents a standard engineering scenario involving heat transfer principles and statistical uncertainty analysis. All necessary data and definitions are provided, and there are no internal contradictions or factual errors. The problem is valid.\n\nThe solution proceeds by deriving the necessary expressions from first principles as demanded.\n\n**Task 1: Expression for Required Area**\n\nThe heat duty $Q$ is given by the fundamental relation:\n$$\nQ = U A F \\Delta T_{\\mathrm{lm}}\n$$\nwhere $U$ is the overall heat transfer coefficient, $A$ is the heat transfer area, $F$ is the correction factor, and $\\Delta T_{\\mathrm{lm}}$ is the Log Mean Temperature Difference.\n\nSolving for the area $A$ yields:\n$$\nA = \\frac{Q}{U F \\Delta T_{\\mathrm{lm}}}\n$$\nThe Log Mean Temperature Difference for a counter-current heat exchanger is defined as:\n$$\n\\Delta T_{\\mathrm{lm}} = \\frac{\\Delta T_1 - \\Delta T_2}{\\ln(\\Delta T_1 / \\Delta T_2)}\n$$\nwith the terminal temperature differences $\\Delta T_1$ and $\\Delta T_2$ given by:\n$$\n\\Delta T_1 = T_{h,\\mathrm{in}} - T_{c,\\mathrm{out}} \\\\\n\\Delta T_2 = T_{h,\\mathrm{out}} - T_{c,\\mathrm{in}}\n$$\nSubstituting the expression for $\\Delta T_{\\mathrm{lm}}$ and the terminal temperature differences into the equation for $A$, we obtain the area as a function of the uncertain variables $\\mathbf{x} = [U, T_{h,\\mathrm{in}}, T_{h,\\mathrm{out}}, T_{c,\\mathrm{in}}, T_{c,\\mathrm{out}}]^{\\top}$:\n$$\nA(\\mathbf{x}) = \\frac{Q}{U F} \\left( \\frac{(T_{h,\\mathrm{in}} - T_{c,\\mathrm{out}}) - (T_{h,\\mathrm{out}} - T_{c,\\mathrm{in}})}{\\ln\\left(\\frac{T_{h,\\mathrm{in}} - T_{c,\\mathrm{out}}}{T_{h,\\mathrm{out}} - T_{c,\\mathrm{in}}}\\right)} \\right)^{-1} = \\frac{Q}{U F} \\left( \\frac{\\ln(\\Delta T_1) - \\ln(\\Delta T_2)}{\\Delta T_1 - \\Delta T_2} \\right)\n$$\nwhere $Q$ and $F$ are treated as known constants.\n\n**Task 2: Jacobian Derivation**\n\nTo apply the first-order propagation of uncertainty, we must compute the Jacobian (gradient) of $A$ with respect to the vector of uncertain variables $\\mathbf{x}$, evaluated at their mean values $\\boldsymbol{\\mu}$. The Jacobian is a row vector:\n$$\n\\mathbf{J} = \\left[ \\frac{\\partial A}{\\partial U}, \\frac{\\partial A}{\\partial T_{h,\\mathrm{in}}}, \\frac{\\partial A}{\\partial T_{h,\\mathrm{out}}}, \\frac{\\partial A}{\\partial T_{c,\\mathrm{in}}}, \\frac{\\partial A}{\\partial T_{c,\\mathrm{out}}} \\right]_{\\mathbf{x}=\\boldsymbol{\\mu}}\n$$\nThe partial derivative with respect to $U$ is straightforward:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial A}{\\partial U} = -\\frac{Q}{U^2 F \\Delta T_{\\mathrm{lm}}} = -\\frac{A}{U}\n$$\nFor the temperature derivatives, we apply the chain rule. It is more convenient to express the derivatives of $A$ with respect to $\\Delta T_1$ and $\\Delta T_2$ first. Let $C' = Q/(UF)$.\n$$\nA = C' \\left( \\frac{\\ln(\\Delta T_1) - \\ln(\\Delta T_2)}{\\Delta T_1 - \\Delta T_2} \\right)\n$$\nThe partial derivative of $A$ with respect to $\\Delta T_1$ is:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial A}{\\partial \\Delta T_1} = C' \\frac{\\frac{1}{\\Delta T_1}(\\Delta T_1 - \\Delta T_2) - (\\ln(\\Delta T_1) - \\ln(\\Delta T_2))(1)}{(\\Delta T_1 - \\Delta T_2)^2} = C' \\frac{1 - \\frac{\\Delta T_2}{\\Delta T_1} - \\ln\\left(\\frac{\\Delta T_1}{\\Delta T_2}\\right)}{(\\Delta T_1 - \\Delta T_2)^2}\n$$\nThe partial derivative of $A$ with respect to $\\Delta T_2$ is:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial A}{\\partial \\Delta T_2} = C' \\frac{-\\frac{1}{\\Delta T_2}(\\Delta T_1 - \\Delta T_2) - (\\ln(\\Delta T_1) - \\ln(\\Delta T_2))(-1)}{(\\Delta T_1 - \\Delta T_2)^2} = C' \\frac{-\\frac{\\Delta T_1}{\\Delta T_2} + 1 + \\ln\\left(\\frac{\\Delta T_1}{\\Delta T_2}\\right)}{(\\Delta T_1 - \\Delta T_2)^2}\n$$\nNow, using the chain rule again with the definitions of $\\Delta T_1$ and $\\Delta T_2$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial A}{\\partial T_j} = \\frac{\\partial A}{\\partial \\Delta T_1} \\frac{\\partial \\Delta T_1}{\\partial T_j} + \\frac{\\partial A}{\\partial \\Delta T_2} \\frac{\\partial \\Delta T_2}{\\partial T_j}\n$$\nThe derivatives of $\\Delta T_1$ and $\\Delta T_2$ are:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial \\Delta T_1}{\\partial T_{h,\\mathrm{in}}} = 1, \\quad \\frac{\\partial \\Delta T_1}{\\partial T_{c,\\mathrm{out}}} = -1 \\quad (\\text{other derivatives are } 0) \\\\\n\\frac{\\partial \\Delta T_2}{\\partial T_{h,\\mathrm{out}}} = 1, \\quad \\frac{\\partial \\Delta T_2}{\\partial T_{c,\\mathrm{in}}} = -1 \\quad (\\text{other derivatives are } 0)\n$$\nCombining these results yields the components of the Jacobian for the temperatures:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial A}{\\partial T_{h,\\mathrm{in}}} = \\frac{\\partial A}{\\partial \\Delta T_1}, \\quad \\frac{\\partial A}{\\partial T_{h,\\mathrm{out}}} = \\frac{\\partial A}{\\partial \\Delta T_2}, \\quad \\frac{\\partial A}{\\partial T_{c,\\mathrm{in}}} = -\\frac{\\partial A}{\\partial \\Delta T_2}, \\quad \\frac{\\partial A}{\\partial T_{c,\\mathrm{out}}} = -\\frac{\\partial A}{\\partial \\Delta T_1}\n$$\nThese expressions are numerically unstable as $\\Delta T_1 \\to \\Delta T_2$. In this limit, $\\Delta T_{\\mathrm{lm}} \\to \\Delta T_1 = \\Delta T_2 \\equiv \\Delta T$. The derivatives become indeterminate of the form $0/0$. We must evaluate the limit using L'Hôpital's rule or a Taylor series expansion. Let $\\Delta T_1 = \\Delta T(1+\\epsilon)$ and $\\Delta T_2 = \\Delta T$. As $\\epsilon \\to 0$:\n$$\n\\lim_{\\Delta T_1 \\to \\Delta T} \\frac{\\partial A}{\\partial \\Delta T_1} = -\\frac{Q}{2 U F (\\Delta T)^2} = -\\frac{A}{2 \\Delta T}\n$$\nBy symmetry, a similar result holds for $\\partial A / \\partial \\Delta T_2$:\n$$\n\\lim_{\\Delta T_2 \\to \\Delta T} \\frac{\\partial A}{\\partial \\Delta T_2} = -\\frac{A}{2 \\Delta T}\n$$\nTherefore, for the limiting case where $\\Delta T_1 \\approx \\Delta T_2$, the partial derivatives with respect to the temperatures are approximated by:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial A}{\\partial T_{h,\\mathrm{in}}} \\approx -\\frac{A}{2\\Delta T_1}, \\quad \\frac{\\partial A}{\\partial T_{h,\\mathrm{out}}} \\approx -\\frac{A}{2\\Delta T_2}, \\quad \\frac{\\partial A}{\\partial T_{c,\\mathrm{in}}} \\approx \\frac{A}{2\\Delta T_2}, \\quad \\frac{\\partial A}{\\partial T_{c,\\mathrm{out}}} \\approx \\frac{A}{2\\Delta T_1}\n$$\n\n**Task 3: Uncertainty Propagation and Confidence Interval**\n\nThe first-order approximation for the variance of $A$, denoted $\\mathrm{Var}(A)$ or $\\sigma_A^2$, is given by the matrix equation:\n$$\n\\sigma_A^2 = \\mathbf{J}\\,\\boldsymbol{\\Sigma}\\,\\mathbf{J}^{\\top}\n$$\nwhere $\\mathbf{J}$ is the Jacobian vector evaluated at the mean values $\\boldsymbol{\\mu}$, and $\\boldsymbol{\\Sigma}$ is the covariance matrix of the variables $\\mathbf{x}$. Since $U$ is independent of the temperatures, the covariance matrix $\\boldsymbol{\\Sigma}$ has a block-diagonal structure:\n$$\n\\boldsymbol{\\Sigma} = \\begin{bmatrix} \\sigma_U^2 & \\mathbf{0}_{1 \\times 4} \\\\ \\mathbf{0}_{4 \\times 1} & \\boldsymbol{\\Sigma}_T \\end{bmatrix}\n$$\nHere, $\\sigma_U^2 = \\mathrm{Var}(U)$ and $\\boldsymbol{\\Sigma}_T$ is the $4 \\times 4$ covariance matrix of the temperatures. The problem specifies that $\\boldsymbol{\\Sigma}_T = \\mathbf{D}\\,\\mathbf{R}_{T}\\,\\mathbf{D}$, where $\\mathbf{R}_T$ is the temperature correlation matrix and $\\mathbf{D}$ is the diagonal matrix of temperature standard deviations.\n\nThe variance calculation can be expanded as:\n$$\n\\sigma_A^2 = \\left(\\frac{\\partial A}{\\partial U}\\right)^2 \\sigma_U^2 + \\mathbf{J}_T \\boldsymbol{\\Sigma}_T \\mathbf{J}_T^{\\top}\n$$\nwhere $\\mathbf{J}_T = \\left[ \\frac{\\partial A}{\\partial T_{h,\\mathrm{in}}}, \\frac{\\partial A}{\\partial T_{h,\\mathrm{out}}}, \\frac{\\partial A}{\\partial T_{c,\\mathrm{in}}}, \\frac{\\partial A}{\\partial T_{c,\\mathrm{out}}} \\right]$. All partial derivatives are evaluated at the mean values of the input variables.\n\nAssuming the resulting distribution of $A$ is approximately normal, a two-sided $95\\%$ confidence interval is constructed as:\n$$\n[A_{\\mathrm{low}}, A_{\\mathrm{high}}] = [A_{\\mathrm{mean}} - z\\,\\sigma_{A}, A_{\\mathrm{mean}} + z\\,\\sigma_{A}]\n$$\nwhere $A_{\\mathrm{mean}}$ is the area calculated using the mean values of all inputs, $\\sigma_A = \\sqrt{\\sigma_A^2}$, and $z=1.96$ is the quantile of the standard normal distribution corresponding to a $95\\%$ confidence level.\n\n**Task 4: Implementation**\n\nThe computational procedure is implemented as follows:\n1.  For each test case, the mean values of $\\Delta T_1$ and $\\Delta T_2$ are computed.\n2.  The mean Log Mean Temperature Difference, $\\Delta T_{\\mathrm{lm}}$, is calculated. A tolerance check is used: if $|\\Delta T_1 - \\Delta T_2|$ is very small relative to their magnitude, the limiting value $\\Delta T_{\\mathrm{lm}} = \\Delta T_1$ is used.\n3.  The mean area $A_{\\mathrm{mean}}$ is calculated.\n4.  The Jacobian vector $\\mathbf{J}$ is computed, using the general derivative formulas or the limiting case formulas based on the same tolerance check.\n5.  The $5 \\times 5$ covariance matrix $\\boldsymbol{\\Sigma}$ is constructed.\n6.  The variance $\\sigma_A^2$ is computed via the matrix product $\\mathbf{J}\\,\\boldsymbol{\\Sigma}\\,\\mathbf{J}^{\\top}$.\n7.  The standard deviation $\\sigma_A$ is found by taking the square root of the variance.\n8.  The lower and upper bounds of the $95\\%$ confidence interval are calculated and all results are rounded to four decimal places.\nThis procedure is encapsulated in a Python program to process the specified test suite.", "answer": "```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef calculate_area_uncertainty(Q, F, mu_U, sigma_U, mu_temps, sigma_temps, R_T):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the mean required area and its 95% confidence interval.\n    \n    Args:\n        Q (float): Heat duty in W.\n        F (float): Correction factor.\n        mu_U (float): Mean of the overall heat transfer coefficient in W/m^2/K.\n        sigma_U (float): Standard deviation of U.\n        mu_temps (list[float]): Mean temperatures [Th_in, Th_out, Tc_in, Tc_out] in Celsius.\n        sigma_temps (list[float]): Standard deviations of temperatures.\n        R_T (np.ndarray): 4x4 temperature correlation matrix.\n\n    Returns:\n        tuple[float, float, float]: Mean area, lower CI bound, upper CI bound.\n    \"\"\"\n    z_95 = 1.96\n    \n    # Unpack mean temperatures\n    mu_Th_in, mu_Th_out, mu_Tc_in, mu_Tc_out = mu_temps\n\n    # 1.
