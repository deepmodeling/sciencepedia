The dimension is Power, $[P] = [M][L]^2[T]^{-3}$.\n\n2.  **Heat Transfer Area ($A$)**: This is the surface area across which heat is exchanged.\n    - In the SI system, area is a measure of a two-dimensional surface.\n    - The unit for length is the meter ($m$).\n    - Therefore, the SI unit for area is square meters ($m^2$). The dimension is $[L]^2$.\n\n3.  **Logarithmic Mean Temperature Difference ($\\Delta T_{lm}$)**: This quantity is defined as:\n    $$\\Delta T_{lm} = \\frac{\\Delta T_1 - \\Delta T_2}{\\ln\\left(\\frac{\\Delta T_1}{\\Delta T_2}\\right)}$$\n    where $\\Delta T_1$ and $\\Delta T_2$ are the temperature differences between the hot and cold fluid streams at the two ends of the heat exchanger.\n    - The terms $\\Delta T_1$ and $\\Delta T_2$ are temperature differences. The SI unit for thermodynamic temperature is the Kelvin ($K$). A temperature difference also has units of Kelvin.\n    - The numerator, $\\Delta T_1 - \\Delta T_2$, therefore has units of Kelvin ($K$).\n    - The argument of the natural logarithm function, $\\ln(\\dots)$, must be a dimensionless quantity. Here, the argument is the ratio $\\frac{\\Delta T_1}{\\Delta T_2}$. Since both $\\Delta T_1$ and $\\Delta T_2$ have units of Kelvin, their ratio is dimensionless: $\\frac{[K]}{[K]} = 1$.\n    - The result of the function $\\ln(x)$ where $x$ is dimensionless is also a dimensionless number.\n    - Therefore, the units of $\\Delta T_{lm}$ are the units of the numerator divided by the units of the denominator: $\\frac{[K]}{[\\text{dimensionless}]} = [K]$.\n    - The SI unit for $\\Delta T_{lm}$ is Kelvin ($K$). The presence of a logarithm does not render the quantity dimensionless; rather, the logarithm function must operate on a dimensionless argument, and its output is also dimensionless, leaving the units of the numerator intact.\n\n4.  **Overall Heat Transfer Coefficient ($U$)**: The units for $U$ can be derived by rearranging the governing equation:\n    $$U = \\frac{\\dot{Q}}{A \\Delta T_{lm}}$$\n    Substituting the SI units for the other quantities:\n    - Units of $\\dot{Q}$: $W$\n    - Units of $A$: $m^2$\n    - Units of $\\Delta T_{lm}$: $K$\n    - Therefore, the SI units for $U$ are $\\frac{W}{m^2 \\cdot K}$, which is written as $W \\cdot m^{-2} \\cdot K^{-1}$.\n    - The dimensional consistency of the original equation $\\dot{Q} = U A \\Delta T_{lm}$ is verified:\n      $$[W] = \\left[\\frac{W}{m^2 \\cdot K}\\right] \\cdot [m^2] \\cdot [K]$$\n      $$[W] = [W]$$\n      The relation is dimensionally consistent.\n\n**Option-by-Option Analysis**\n\nA.

The solution will proceed.\n\n### Derivation\n\nThe analysis begins with the steady-state energy balance, which is an application of the First Law of Thermodynamics. The heat transferred from the hot fluid must equal the heat absorbed by the cold fluid, as heat losses are negligible.\n\nThe total heat transfer rate, $\\dot{Q}$, is determined from the specified conditions for the hot fluid:\n$$ \\dot{Q} = C_{h} (T_{h,\\mathrm{in}} - T_{h,\\mathrm{out}}) $$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$ \\dot{Q} = (4\\,\\mathrm{kW/K}) \\times (140\\,^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C} - 50\\,^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}) = 4 \\times 90 \\,\\mathrm{kW} = 360\\,\\mathrm{kW} $$\n\nUsing this heat rate, we can determine the outlet temperature of the cold fluid, $T_{c,\\mathrm{out}}$, from the energy balance for the cold stream:\n$$ \\dot{Q} = C_{c} (T_{c,\\mathrm{out}} - T_{c,\\mathrm{in}}) $$\n$$ 360\\,\\mathrm{kW} = (6\\,\\mathrm{kW/K}) \\times (T_{c,\\mathrm{out}} - 20\\,^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}) $$\nSolving for $T_{c,\\mathrm{out}}$:\n$$ T_{c,\\mathrm{out}} - 20\\,^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C} = \\frac{360\\,\\mathrm{kW}}{6\\,\\mathrm{kW/K}} = 60\\,\\mathrm{K} = 60\\,^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C} $$\n$$ T_{c,\\mathrm{out}} = 20\\,^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C} + 60\\,^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C} = 80\\,^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C} $$\n\n**Feasibility of the Parallel-Flow Arrangement**\n\nNow we assess the feasibility of the proposed parallel-flow arrangement. In a parallel-flow heat exchanger, both fluids enter at the same end (let us call this end '1') and exit at the other end (end '2'). For heat transfer to occur from the hot fluid to the cold fluid at every point along the exchanger, the Second Law of Thermodynamics requires that $T_h(x) \\ge T_c(x)$ for all positions $x$. This must hold at the boundaries as well.\n\nAt the inlet (end 1):\n$T_{h,1} = T_{h,\\mathrm{in}} = 140\\,^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$\n$T_{c,1} = T_{c,\\mathrm{in}} = 20\\,^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$\nThe temperature difference is $\\Delta T_1 = T_{h,1} - T_{c,1} = 140 - 20 = 120\\,^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$. Here, $T_h > T_c$, which is valid.\n\nAt the outlet (end 2):\n$T_{h,2} = T_{h,\\mathrm{out}} = 50\\,^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$\n$T_{c,2} = T_{c,\\mathrm{out}} = 80\\,^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$\nThe temperature difference is $\\Delta T_2 = T_{h,2} - T_{c,2} = 50 - 80 = -30\\,^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$.\n\nThe outlet temperature of the hot fluid ($50\\,^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$) is lower than the outlet temperature of the cold fluid ($80\\,^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$). This condition is physically impossible in a parallel-flow arrangement, as it would necessitate heat transfer from the colder fluid to the hotter fluid near the outlet, a direct violation of the Second Law of Thermodynamics. Such a scenario is referred to as a \"temperature cross\" and renders the design infeasible. Consequently, the Log Mean Temperature Difference (LMTD) for this configuration, given by $\\Delta T_{\\mathrm{lm}} = (\\Delta T_1 - \\Delta T_2) / \\ln(\\Delta T_1 / \\Delta T_2)$, would involve the logarithm of a negative number ($\\ln(120/(-30))$), which is not a real number. The parallel-flow design is therefore infeasible.\n\n**Feasibility of the Counter-Flow Arrangement**\n\nWe now investigate the alternative counter-flow arrangement. In this configuration, fluids enter at opposite ends. Let end '1' be the hot fluid inlet and cold fluid outlet, and end '2' be the hot fluid outlet and cold fluid inlet.\n\nAt end '1':\n$T_{h,1} = T_{h,\\mathrm{in}} = 140\\,^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$\n$T_{c,1} = T_{c,\\mathrm{out}} = 80\\,^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$\nThe temperature difference is $\\Delta T_1 = T_{h,1} - T_{c,1} = 140 - 80 = 60\\,^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$.\n\nAt end '2':\n$T_{h,2} = T_{h,\\mathrm{out}} = 50\\,^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$\n$T_{c,2} = T_{c,\\mathrm{in}} = 20\\,^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$\nThe temperature difference is $\\Delta T_2 = T_{h,2} - T_{c,2} = 50 - 20 = 30\\,^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$.\n\nBoth end-point temperature differences are positive. For a counter-flow exchanger with constant properties, if both $\\Delta T_1 > 0$ and $\\Delta T_2 > 0$, then the local temperature difference $T_h(x) - T_c(x)$ will be positive throughout the entire exchanger. Thus, the counter-flow arrangement is thermodynamically feasible.\n\nNow, we calculate the LMTD for the counter-flow case:\n$$ \\Delta T_{\\mathrm{lm, counter}} = \\frac{\\Delta T_1 - \\Delta T_2}{\\ln(\\Delta T_1 / \\Delta T_2)} = \\frac{60\\,\\mathrm{K} - 30\\,\\mathrm{K}}{\\ln(60/30)} = \\frac{30\\,\\mathrm{K}}{\\ln(2)} $$\nUsing $\\ln(2) \\approx 0.693147$:\n$$ \\Delta T_{\\mathrm{lm, counter}} \\approx \\frac{30}{0.693147} \\,\\mathrm{K} \\approx 43.28\\,\\mathrm{K} $$\n\nWith the LMTD determined, the required overall conductance $UA$ can be calculated from the fundamental heat exchanger equation $\\dot{Q} = (UA) \\Delta T_{\\mathrm{lm}}$:\n$$ UA = \\frac{\\dot{Q}}{\\Delta T_{\\mathrm{lm, counter}}} = \\frac{360\\,\\mathrm{kW}}{30/\\ln(2)\\,\\mathrm{K}} = \\frac{360}{30} \\ln(2) \\,\\mathrm{kW/K} = 12 \\ln(2) \\,\\mathrm{kW/K} $$\n$$ UA \\approx 12 \\times 0.693147 \\,\\mathrm{kW/K} \\approx 8.31776\\,\\mathrm{kW/K} $$\nThis value is approximately $8.31\\,\\mathrm{kW/K}$.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n- **A. The parallel-flow design is feasible; the Log Mean Temperature Difference is positive, and the required $UA$ equals $8.31\\,\\mathrm{kW/K}$.**\nThe parallel-flow design is demonstrated to be thermodynamically infeasible due to a temperature cross, which violates the Second Law. Therefore, this statement is **Incorrect**.\n\n- **B. The parallel-flow design is infeasible because the outlet-end temperature difference would be negative, rendering the Log Mean Temperature Difference non-real (violating the Second Law).**\nOur analysis shows that for the parallel-flow arrangement, the outlet temperature difference is $T_{h,\\mathrm{out}} - T_{c,\\mathrm{out}} = 50\\,^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C} - 80\\,^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C} = -30\\,^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$. A negative temperature difference implies a violation of the Second Law of Thermodynamics for a sensible heat exchanger. The LMTD calculation would involve the logarithm of a negative number, which is a non-real (complex) value. This statement is rigorously correct. The conclusion is **Correct**.\n\n- **C. Both parallel-flow and counter-flow arrangements are feasible with the same required $UA$ for the stated targets.**\nThe parallel-flow arrangement is infeasible. This immediately falsifies the statement. Furthermore, even if both were feasible, the LMTD for counter-flow is always greater than or equal to that for parallel-flow, meaning the required $UA$ would be smaller for the counter-flow case, not the same. This statement is **Incorrect**.\n\n- **D. The counter-flow arrangement is feasible; the required $UA$ is approximately $8.31\\,\\mathrm{kW/K}$.**\nOur analysis confirmed that the counter-flow arrangement is thermodynamically feasible.

Substituting the expressions for $dT_h$ and $dT_c$:\n$$d(\\Delta T) = -\\frac{d\\dot{Q}}{C_h} - \\frac{d\\dot{Q}}{\\eta C_c} = -d\\dot{Q} \\left( \\frac{1}{C_h} + \\frac{1}{\\eta C_c} \\right)$$\nNow, we substitute $d\\dot{Q} = U \\Delta T da$:\n$$d(\\Delta T) = -U \\Delta T da \\left( \\frac{1}{C_h} + \\frac{1}{\\eta C_c} \\right)$$\nSeparating variables, we get:\n$$\\frac{d(\\Delta T)}{\\Delta T} = -U \\left( \\frac{1}{C_h} + \\frac{1}{\\eta C_c} \\right) da$$\nWe integrate this expression over the entire length of the heat exchanger, from area $a=0$ to $a=A$, corresponding to terminal temperature differences $\\Delta T_1$ and $\\Delta T_2$:\n$$\\int_{\\Delta T_1}^{\\Delta T_2} \\frac{d(\\Delta T)}{\\Delta T} = -U \\left( \\frac{1}{C_h} + \\frac{1}{\\eta C_c} \\right) \\int_0^A da$$\n$$\\ln\\left(\\frac{\\Delta T_2}{\\Delta T_1}\\right) = -U A \\left( \\frac{1}{C_h} + \\frac{1}{\\eta C_c} \\right)$$\nTo proceed, we must evaluate the term in the parentheses for the two flow arrangements. The total heat transfer rate is $\\dot{Q}$.\n\nCase 1: Parallel-Flow\nThe hot and cold fluids enter at the same end ($a=0$) and exit at the other ($a=A$). The cold fluid temperature increases in the direction of flow, so $\\eta=+1$.\nThe energy balances are $\\dot{Q} = C_h (T_{h,in} - T_{h,out})$ and $\\dot{Q} = C_c (T_{c,out} - T_{c,in})$.\nThe term in the parentheses is:\n$$\\frac{1}{C_h} + \\frac{1}{C_c} = \\frac{T_{h,in} - T_{h,out}}{\\dot{Q}} + \\frac{T_{c,out} - T_{c,in}}{\\dot{Q}} = \\frac{(T_{h,in} - T_{c,in}) - (T_{h,out} - T_{c,out})}{\\dot{Q}}$$\nThe terminal temperature differences are $\\Delta T_1 = T_{h,in} - T_{c,in}$ and $\\Delta T_2 = T_{h,out} - T_{c,out}$. Thus:\n$$\\frac{1}{C_h} + \\frac{1}{C_c} = \\frac{\\Delta T_1 - \\Delta T_2}{\\dot{Q}}$$\n\nCase 2: Counter-Flow\nThe fluids enter at opposite ends. Let the hot fluid enter at $a=0$ and the cold fluid enter at $a=A$. The cold fluid temperature decreases along the coordinate $a$, so $\\eta=-1$.\nThe energy balances are $\\dot{Q} = C_h (T_{h,in} - T_{h,out})$ and $\\dot{Q} = C_c (T_{c,out} - T_{c,in})$. The sign convention comes from the differential form. For $da>0$, $dT_c<0$, so $d\\dot{Q} = -C_c dT_c$, meaning $\\eta=-1$ in the framework of $d\\dot{Q}=\\eta C_c dT_c$.\nThe term in the parentheses is:\n$$\\frac{1}{C_h} - \\frac{1}{C_c} = \\frac{T_{h,in} - T_{h,out}}{\\dot{Q}} - \\frac{T_{c,out} - T_{c,in}}{\\dot{Q}} = \\frac{(T_{h,in} - T_{c,out}) - (T_{h,out} - T_{c,in})}{\\dot{Q}}$$\nThe terminal temperature differences are $\\Delta T_1 = T_{h,in} - T_{c,out}$ and $\\Delta T_2 = T_{h,out} - T_{c,in}$. Thus:\n$$\\frac{1}{C_h} - \\frac{1}{C_c} = \\frac{\\Delta T_1 - \\Delta T_2}{\\dot{Q}}$$\n\nFor both cases, we substitute this result back into the integrated equation:\n$$\\ln\\left(\\frac{\\Delta T_2}{\\Delta T_1}\\right) = -U A \\left( \\frac{\\Delta T_1 - \\Delta T_2}{\\dot{Q}} \\right) = U A \\left( \\frac{\\Delta T_2 - \\Delta T_1}{\\dot{Q}} \\right)$$\nRearranging for $\\dot{Q}$ gives the final relation:\n$$\\dot{Q} = U A \\frac{\\Delta T_2 - \\Delta T_1}{\\ln(\\Delta T_2 / \\Delta T_1)} = U A \\frac{\\Delta T_1 - \\Delta T_2}{\\ln(\\Delta T_1 / \\Delta T_2)}$$\nThis defines the mean temperature difference as the Logarithmic Mean Temperature Difference (LMTD), $\\Delta T_{LMTD}$:\n$$\\Delta T_{mean} = \\Delta T_{LMTD} = \\frac{\\Delta T_1 - \\Delta T_2}{\\ln(\\Delta T_1 / \\Delta T_2)}$$\n\nNext, we analyze the asymptotic behavior where one terminal difference is much smaller than the other. Let $\\Delta T_s = \\min\\{\\Delta T_1, \\Delta T_2\\}$ and $\\Delta T_\\ell = \\max\\{\\Delta T_1, \\Delta T_2\\}$. The LMTD can be written as:\n$$\\Delta T_{LMTD} = \\frac{\\Delta T_\\ell - \\Delta T_s}{\\ln(\\Delta T_\\ell / \\Delta T_s)}$$\nIn the limit $\\Delta T_s \\ll \\Delta T_\\ell$, let $\\epsilon = \\Delta T_s / \\Delta T_\\ell \\to 0^+$.\n$$\\Delta T_{LMTD} = \\frac{\\Delta T_\\ell (1 - \\epsilon)}{\\ln(1/\\epsilon)} = \\frac{\\Delta T_\\ell (1 - \\epsilon)}{-\\ln(\\epsilon)}$$\nFor $\\epsilon \\to 0$, the term $(1 - \\epsilon) \\to 1$. Thus, the leading-order asymptotic behavior is:\n$$\\Delta T_{LMTD} \\sim \\frac{\\Delta T_\\ell}{-\\ln(\\epsilon)} = \\frac{\\Delta T_\\ell}{\\ln(1/\\epsilon)} = \\frac{\\Delta T_\\ell}{\\ln(\\Delta T_\\ell / \\Delta T_s)}$$\n\nNow, we perform the numerical calculations.\nGiven data: $\\dot{Q}=2.00\\times 10^6\\,\\mathrm{W}$, $U=1.00\\times 10^3\\,\\mathrm{W\\,m^{-2}\\,K^{-1}}$.\nCase 1: $\\Delta T_1=20.0\\,\\mathrm{K}$ and $\\Delta T_2=0.50\\,\\mathrm{K}$.\nThe LMTD is:\n$$\\Delta T_{LMTD,1} = \\frac{20.0 - 0.50}{\\ln(20.0 / 0.50)} = \\frac{19.5}{\\ln(40)} \\approx \\frac{19.5}{3.688879} \\approx 5.2863\\,\\mathrm{K}$$\nThe required area $A_1$ is:\n$$A_1 = \\frac{\\dot{Q}}{U \\Delta T_{LMTD,1}} = \\frac{2.00 \\times 10^6\\,\\mathrm{W}}{(1.00 \\times 10^3\\,\\mathrm{W\\,m^{-2}\\,K^{-1}}) (5.2863\\,\\mathrm{K})} \\approx 378.33\\,\\mathrm{m^2}$$\n\nCase 2 (with rounding): $\\Delta T_1=20.0\\,\\mathrm{K}$ and $\\Delta T_2=1.0\\,\\mathrm{K}$.\nThe LMTD is:\n$$\\Delta T_{LMTD,2} = \\frac{20.0 - 1.0}{\\ln(20.0 / 1.0)} = \\frac{19.0}{\\ln(20)} \\approx \\frac{19.0}{2.995732} \\approx 6.3423\\,\\mathrm{K}$$\nThe required area $A_2$ is:\n$$A_2 = \\frac{\\dot{Q}}{U \\Delta T_{LMTD,2}} = \\frac{2.00 \\times 10^6\\,\\mathrm{W}}{(1.00 \\times 10^3\\,\\mathrm{W\\,m^{-2}\\,K^{-1}}) (6.3423\\,\\mathrm{K})} \\approx 315.35\\,\\mathrm{m^2}$$\nThe percentage change in the computed area is:\n$$\\%\\,\\text{change} = \\frac{A_2 - A_1}{A_1} \\times 100\\% = \\frac{315.35 - 378.33}{378.33} \\times 100\\% \\approx -16.65\\%$$\n\nWith these derivations and calculations, we now evaluate each statement.\n\nA. In the regime $\\Delta T_s \\ll \\Delta T_\\ell$ for either parallel-flow or counter-flow, the mean temperature difference is asymptotically $\\Delta T_\\mathrm{mean}\\sim \\dfrac{\\Delta T_\\ell}{\\ln\\!\\left(\\dfrac{\\Delta T_\\ell}{\\Delta T_s}\\right)}$, so for fixed $\\dot{Q}$ and $U$ the required area diverges like $\\ln\\!\\left(\\dfrac{\\Delta T_\\ell}{\\Delta T_s}\\right)$ as $\\Delta T_s\\to 0^+$.\nThis statement is fully supported by our asymptotic analysis. The derived asymptotic form for $\\Delta T_{mean}$ is exact. The required area is $A = \\dot{Q} / (U \\Delta T_{mean})$. Substituting the asymptotic form:\n$$A \\sim \\frac{\\dot{Q}}{U} \\frac{\\ln(\\Delta T_\\ell / \\Delta T_s)}{\\Delta T_\\ell}$$\nAs $\\Delta T_s \\to 0^+$, the term $\\ln(\\Delta T_\\ell / \\Delta T_s)$ grows without bound, causing the area $A$ to diverge. The divergence is proportional to $\\ln(\\Delta T_\\ell / \\Delta T_s)$. This statement is **Correct**.\n\nB. When one terminal difference is much smaller than the other in counter-flow, the mean temperature difference may be taken as the arithmetic mean $\\dfrac{\\Delta T_1+\\Delta T_2}{2}$, which prevents the required area from diverging as $\\Delta T_s\\to 0^+$.\nThe arithmetic mean $\\Delta T_{AM} = (\\Delta T_1 + \\Delta T_2)/2$ is a good approximation for the LMTD only when $\\Delta T_1 \\approx \\Delta T_2$. In the specified regime $\\Delta T_s \\ll \\Delta T_\\ell$, the two are significantly different. For our numerical case, $\\Delta T_{LMTD,1} \\approx 5.29\\,\\mathrm{K}$ while $\\Delta T_{AM} = (20.0+0.50)/2 = 10.25\\,\\mathrm{K}$. They differ by nearly a factor of $2$. Using the arithmetic mean is physically incorrect in this limit. The area would indeed remain finite if one were to use the arithmetic mean, but this is based on a false premise. The true mean temperature difference leads to divergence. The statement is **Incorrect**.\n\nC. Rounding the smaller terminal difference from $0.50\\,\\mathrm{K}$ to $1.0\\,\\mathrm{K}$ changes the mean temperature difference by less than $1\\,\\%$, so such rounding has negligible impact on area sizing in near-pinch designs.\nOur calculation shows that rounding $\\Delta T_2$ from $0.50\\,\\mathrm{K}$ to $1.0\\,\\mathrm{K}$ changes the LMTD from $5.2863\\,\\mathrm{K}$ to $6.3423\\,\\mathrm{K}$, a change of $\\frac{6.3423 - 5.2863}{5.2863} \\times 100\\% \\approx 19.98\\%$. This is far from being less than $1\\%$. Consequently, the required area changes by $-16.65\\%$, which is a very significant impact. Near-pinch designs are extremely sensitive to the value of the small temperature difference. The statement is demonstrably false. This statement is **Incorrect**.\n\nD. If a numerical evaluation of the mean temperature difference yields a negative value because of sign conventions on $\\Delta T_1$ and $\\Delta T_2$, one should enforce positivity by taking absolute values; this has no implications for feasibility or area sizing because only the magnitude matters.\nThe LMTD formula $\\frac{\\Delta T_1 - \\Delta T_2}{\\ln(\\Delta T_1/\\Delta T_2)}$ can only be negative if $\\Delta T_1$ and $\\Delta T_2$ have opposite signs (assuming both are non-zero), as the ratio of two positive numbers always has a positive logarithm. A negative terminal difference, e.g., $\\Delta T_2 < 0$, implies $T_c > T_h$ at that end, a situation known as a 'temperature cross'. This violates the fundamental assumption $T_h > T_c$ throughout the exchanger, upon which the LMTD derivation is based. Such a condition indicates a physically infeasible design or a misapplication of the model. Simply taking the absolute value would mask a critical flaw in the process design, which has profound implications for feasibility. The statement is physically and logically unsound. This statement is **Incorrect**.\n\nE. For fixed inlet temperatures and heat capacity rates, counter-flow yields a larger mean temperature difference than parallel-flow; however, as one terminal difference is driven to be much smaller than the other, both arrangements exhibit the same logarithmic penalty embodied in option A, and the required area grows without bound in the same asymptotic manner.\nThe first part of the statement is a well-established principle of heat exchanger analysis: for identical inlet conditions, $(\\Delta T_{LMTD})_{\\text{counter-flow}} \\ge (\\Delta T_{LMTD})_{\\text{parallel-flow}}$. This makes counter-flow thermodynamically more effective, typically requiring less area for a given duty. The second part addresses the asymptotic behavior near a pinch point ($\\Delta T_s \\to 0$). Our derivation of the LMTD and its asymptotic limit is mathematically general and applies to both flow configurations. The penalty, manifesting as a required area that grows logarithmically $A \\propto \\ln(1/\\Delta T_s)$, is a fundamental consequence of operating near a zero temperature difference, regardless of the flow arrangement. The statement correctly identifies the general advantage of counter-flow while also correctly noting that both arrangements suffer from the same type of mathematical divergence in area requirement when approaching a pinch. This statement is **Correct**.\n\nBased on the analysis, statements A and E are correct.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{AE}$$", "id": "2501386"}]}
