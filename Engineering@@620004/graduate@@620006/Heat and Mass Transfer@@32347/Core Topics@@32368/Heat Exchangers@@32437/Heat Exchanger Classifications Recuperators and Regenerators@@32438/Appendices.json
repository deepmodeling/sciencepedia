A solution will be formulated.\n\n**Solution Derivation**\nThe analysis begins with the First Law of Thermodynamics for a steady-flow open system (control volume). For the two fluid streams, the energy balance equations are formulated. Since the problem specifies constant specific heats, the change in enthalpy is directly proportional to the change in temperature.\n\nThe rate of heat transfer from the hot fluid is given by:\n$$q = \\dot{m}_h c_{p,h} (T_{h,in} - T_{h,out})$$\nwhere $\\dot{m}_h$ is the mass flow rate and $c_{p,h}$ is the specific heat at constant pressure of the hot fluid. The product $\\dot{m}_h c_{p,h}$ is defined as the heat capacity rate of the hot fluid, $C_h$.\n$$q = C_h (T_{h,in} - T_{h,out}) \\quad (1)$$\nSimilarly, the rate of heat transfer to the cold fluid is:\n$$q = \\dot{m}_c c_{p,c} (T_{c,out} - T_{c,in})$$\nwhere the heat capacity rate of the cold fluid is $C_c = \\dot{m}_c c_{p,c}$.\n$$q = C_c (T_{c,out} - T_{c,in}) \\quad (2)$$\nThe heat exchanger is adiabatic with respect to the surroundings, meaning the heat lost by the hot stream is entirely absorbed by the cold stream.\n\nThe problem requires a derivation of the maximum possible heat transfer rate, $q_{max}$, from first principles. This thermodynamic limit is achieved in a hypothetical counter-flow heat exchanger of infinite surface area. In such an ideal device, the outlet temperature of one of the fluids would approach the inlet temperature of the other. The total energy transfer is limited by the maximum possible temperature difference, $\\Delta T_{max} = T_{h,in} - T_{c,in}$, and the smaller of the two heat capacity rates.\n\nLet $C_{min}$ be the minimum of $\\{C_h, C_c\\}$ and $C_{max}$ be the maximum of $\\{C_h, C_c\\}$. From the energy balance $C_h \\Delta T_h = C_c \\Delta T_c$, it is clear that for a given heat transfer rate $q$, the fluid with the smaller heat capacity rate will undergo the larger temperature change. Therefore, the heat transfer process is limited by the fluid with $C_{min}$, as it will reach the maximum possible temperature change first.\n\nThe maximum possible temperature change for any fluid in the exchanger is $\\Delta T_{max} = T_{h,in} - T_{c,in}$. The maximum heat transfer occurs when the fluid with the heat capacity rate $C_{min}$ undergoes this temperature change.\nThus, the expression for the maximum possible heat transfer rate is:\n$$q_{max} = C_{min} (T_{h,in} - T_{c,in})$$\nThis completes the required derivation from first principles.\n\nNow, we proceed with the numerical computation. First, identify $C_{min}$:\n$C_h = 1.2\\,\\mathrm{kW/K}$\n$C_c = 2.4\\,\\mathrm{kW/K}$\nTherefore, $C_{min} = C_h = 1.2\\,\\mathrm{kW/K}$.\n\nSubstitute the given values to calculate $q_{max}$:\n$$q_{max} = (1.2\\,\\mathrm{kW/K}) \\times (600\\,\\mathrm{K} - 300\\,\\mathrm{K}) = 1.2 \\times 300\\,\\mathrm{kW} = 360\\,\\mathrm{kW}$$\n\nThe effectiveness, $\\epsilon$, is defined as the ratio of the actual heat transfer rate, $q$, to the maximum possible rate, $q_{max}$.\n$$\\epsilon = \\frac{q}{q_{max}}$$\nThe actual heat transfer rate $q$ can be calculated using the given effectiveness $\\epsilon = 0.7$:\n$$q = \\epsilon \\cdot q_{max} = 0.7 \\times 360\\,\\mathrm{kW} = 252\\,\\mathrm{kW}$$\n\nFinally, the outlet temperatures, $T_{h,out}$ and $T_{c,out}$, are computed by rearranging the energy balance equations ($1$) and ($2$).\n\nFor the hot stream:\n$$T_{h,out} = T_{h,in} - \\frac{q}{C_h}$$\n$$T_{h,out} = 600\\,\\mathrm{K} - \\frac{252\\,\\mathrm{kW}}{1.2\\,\\mathrm{kW/K}} = 600\\,\\mathrm{K} - 210\\,\\mathrm{K} = 390\\,\\mathrm{K}$$\n\nFor the cold stream:\n$$T_{c,out} = T_{c,in} + \\frac{q}{C_c}$$\n$$T_{c,out} = 300\\,\\mathrm{K} + \\frac{252\\,\\mathrm{kW}}{2.4\\,\\mathrm{kW/K}} = 300\\,\\mathrm{K} + 105\\,\\mathrm{K} = 405\\,\\mathrm{K}$$\n\nThe results are $q_{max} = 360\\,\\mathrm{kW}$, $T_{h,out} = 390\\,\\mathrm{K}$, and $T_{c,out} = 405\\,\\mathrm{K}$. Rounding to four significant figures as requested, the values are $360.0\\,\\mathrm{kW}$, $390.0\\,\\mathrm{K}$, and $405.0\\,\\mathrm{K}$. The final results are consistent with the principles of thermodynamics; specifically, for a counter-flow arrangement (which yields the highest effectiveness for a given NTU), it is possible for the cold fluid exit temperature to exceed the hot fluid exit temperature, as observed here ($T_{c,out} > T_{h,out}$).", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 360.0 & 390.0 & 405.0 \\end{pmatrix}}$$", "id": "2493154"}, {"introduction": "While system-level parameters like effectiveness are useful for analysis, designing a physical heat exchanger requires a deeper understanding of what governs its performance.

A complete solution will be provided.\n\n**Derivation of the Dimensionless Penetration Ratio, $\\Pi$**\n\nThe objective is to derive an expression for the dimensionless penetration ratio, $\\Pi$, defined as:\n$$ \\Pi = \\frac{\\delta_{\\tau}}{L_{solid}} $$\nwhere $\\delta_{\\tau}$ is the thermal penetration depth in the solid matrix over the duration of a blow, $\\tau$, and $L_{solid}$ is the characteristic half-thickness of a solid ligament in the porous matrix.\n\nFirst, we must derive an expression for the characteristic half-thickness, $L_{solid}$. The problem states this must be done using only geometric relations. For a porous medium, a characteristic length scale of the solid phase can be defined as the ratio of the solid volume to the interfacial (solid-fluid) surface area.\nLet $V_T$ be an arbitrary total volume of the porous matrix.\nThe volume of the solid phase, $V_s$, is given by:\n$$ V_s = (1 - \\varepsilon) V_T $$\nwhere $\\varepsilon$ is the porosity.\nThe total interfacial surface area, $A_{int}$, within this volume is given by:\n$$ A_{int} = a_s V_T $$\nwhere $a_s$ is the specific surface area.\n\nThe characteristic length scale of the solid is the ratio of these two quantities:\n$$ L_{solid} = \\frac{V_s}{A_{int}} = \\frac{(1 - \\varepsilon) V_T}{a_s V_T} = \\frac{1 - \\varepsilon}{a_s} $$\nThis length scale represents the volume of solid per unit of its surface area, which is analogous to the half-thickness for a simple slab geometry. This will serve as the denominator in the expression for $\\Pi$.\n\nNext, we derive an expression for the thermal penetration depth, $\\delta_{\\tau}$. The problem requires this to be derived from the transient heat diffusion equation. The one-dimensional heat diffusion equation in the solid is:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial t} = \\alpha_s \\frac{\\partial^2 T}{\\partial x^2} $$\nwhere $\\alpha_s$ is the thermal diffusivity of the solid.

From a scaling analysis of the heat equation, we can balance the terms:\n$$ \\frac{[T]}{[t]} \\sim \\alpha_s \\frac{[T]}{[x]^2} $$\nFor a characteristic time $t = \\tau$ and characteristic length $x = \\delta_{\\tau}$, this scaling becomes:\n$$ \\frac{1}{\\tau} \\sim \\frac{\\alpha_s}{\\delta_{\\tau}^2} $$\nSolving for the penetration depth, $\\delta_{\\tau}$, gives:\n$$ \\delta_{\\tau} \\sim \\sqrt{\\alpha_s \\tau} $$\nThe constant of proportionality is of order unity and is conventionally omitted in such a scaling analysis.\n\nNow, we can assemble the expression for $\\Pi$ by substituting the expressions for $L_{solid}$ and $\\delta_{\\tau}$:\n$$ \\Pi = \\frac{\\delta_{\\tau}}{L_{solid}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{\\alpha_s \\tau}}{\\frac{1 - \\varepsilon}{a_s}} = \\frac{a_s}{1 - \\varepsilon} \\sqrt{\\alpha_s \\tau} $$\nSubstituting the definition of $\\alpha_s$:\n$$ \\Pi = \\frac{a_s}{1 - \\varepsilon} \\sqrt{\\frac{k_s \\tau}{\\rho_s c_{p,s}}} $$\nThis is the required expression for the dimensionless penetration ratio in terms of the given material properties and morphological descriptors. The volumetric heat transfer coefficient $h_a a_s$ is not required for this derivation, as specified.\n\n**Numerical Evaluation of $\\Pi$**\n\nWe are given the following values:\n- $\\varepsilon = 0.85$\n- $a_s = 1.50 \\times 10^{3}\\ \\mathrm{m}^{-1}$\n- $\\rho_s c_{p,s} = 4.00 \\times 10^{6}\\ \\mathrm{J\\cdot m^{-3}\\cdot K^{-1}}$\n- $k_s = 16.0\\ \\mathrm{W\\cdot m^{-1}\\cdot K^{-1}}$\n- $\\tau = 0.500\\ \\mathrm{s}$\n\nFirst, we calculate the thermal diffusivity, $\\alpha_s$:\n$$ \\alpha_s = \\frac{k_s}{\\rho_s c_{p,s}} = \\frac{16.0\\ \\mathrm{W\\cdot m^{-1}\\cdot K^{-1}}}{4.00 \\times 10^{6}\\ \\mathrm{J\\cdot m^{-3}\\cdot K^{-1}}} = 4.00 \\times 10^{-6}\\ \\mathrm{m^2\\cdot s^{-1}} $$\n\nNext, we calculate the term under the square root:\n$$ \\alpha_s \\tau = (4.00 \\times 10^{-6}\\ \\mathrm{m^2\\cdot s^{-1}}) \\times (0.500\\ \\mathrm{s}) = 2.00 \\times 10^{-6}\\ \\mathrm{m}^2 $$\nThe thermal penetration depth is therefore:\n$$ \\delta_{\\tau} = \\sqrt{2.00 \\times 10^{-6}\\ \\mathrm{m}^2} = \\sqrt{2.00} \\times 10^{-3}\\ \\mathrm{m} \\approx 1.41421 \\times 10^{-3}\\ \\mathrm{m} $$\n\nNow, we calculate the characteristic half-thickness, $L_{solid}$:\n$$ L_{solid} = \\frac{1 - \\varepsilon}{a_s} = \\frac{1 - 0.85}{1.50 \\times 10^{3}\\ \\mathrm{m}^{-1}} = \\frac{0.15}{1.50 \\times 10^{3}\\ \\mathrm{m}^{-1}} = 1.00 \\times 10^{-4}\\ \\mathrm{m} $$\n\nFinally, we compute the ratio $\\Pi$:\n$$ \\Pi = \\frac{\\delta_{\\tau}}{L_{solid}} = \\frac{1.41421 \\times 10^{-3}\\ \\mathrm{m}}{1.00 \\times 10^{-4}\\ \\mathrm{m}} = 14.1421 $$\n\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures.\n$$ \\Pi \\approx 14.14 $$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{14.14}$$", "id": "2493144"}]}
