The exchanger comprises $2$ parallel channel pairs within a single pass on each side, sharing equal heat transfer area per pair, but suffering hot-side maldistribution: the hot capacity rates split as $C_{h,1}=0.5\\,\\mathrm{kW/K}$ and $C_{h,2}=3.5\\,\\mathrm{kW/K}$, while the cold splits evenly as $C_{c,1}=C_{c,2}=1.5\\,\\mathrm{kW/K}$.

Specifically:\n\n- For each pair $i\\in\\{1,2\\}$, use conservation of energy and standard relations to compute $(T_{h,\\mathrm{out},i},\\,T_{c,\\mathrm{out},i})$ given $T_{h,\\mathrm{in}}$, $T_{c,\\mathrm{in}}$, $C_{h,i}$, $C_{c,i}$, and $UA_i$.\n- Compute the capacity-weighted mixed outlet temperatures on each side, $(\\bar T_{h,\\mathrm{out}},\\,\\bar T_{c,\\mathrm{out}})$, before leakage mixing in the cold outlet header, and then the leakage-mixed cold outlet temperature $\\tilde T_{c,\\mathrm{out}}$ when the hot slip stream joins the cold outlet header.\n- Using these results, assess whether a local comparison at the hot and cold outlet headers can exhibit $T_{c}>T_{h}$ at some header locations even if $\\tilde T_{c,\\mathrm{out}}<\\bar T_{h,\\mathrm{out}}$ globally.\n\nWhich option best explains the mechanism and prescribes an experimentally sound diagnostic plan to detect it?\n\nA. Severe hot-side maldistribution can render one pair with $C_{h,1}\\ll C_{c,1}$ and high local $UA_1$, driving $T_{c,\\mathrm{out},1}>T_{h,\\mathrm{out},1}$ for that pair (a terminal “local cross”), while the parallel second pair remains far from cross; capacity-weighted mixing then yields $\\bar T_{c,\\mathrm{out}}<\\bar T_{h,\\mathrm{out}}$, so the global design shows no cross. Minor hot-to-cold leakage further elevates cold outlet header temperatures locally. A suitable diagnostic set is: multi-point thermocouple rakes across both hot and cold outlet headers to map $T$ fields, per-pass differential pressure measurements to quantify maldistribution, a conservative tracer step test (e.g., salt conductivity) on one side with detection on both outlets to identify leakage and bypass, and infrared thermography of plate surfaces to visualize nonuniform heat transfer and gasket hot spots.\n\nB. Temperature cross requires the global condition $C_h<C_c$; if $C_h>C_c$ globally, neither local nor global cross is possible. Therefore, diagnosing requires only comparing bulk terminal temperatures and the Log Mean Temperature Difference (LMTD) to design; if they match, no further tests are necessary.\n\nC. The only way to obtain apparent local cross is axial thermal conduction along the plates in the headers, which can raise cold-side metal temperature above hot fluid temperature locally without maldistribution or leakage. A single thermocouple at each terminal and a calorimetric overall energy balance suffice to diagnose the phenomenon.\n\nD. Maldistribution alone cannot create any apparent temperature cross in a counterflow plate exchanger; only large external heat losses could produce such observations.

No temperature cross occurs.\n\n**Mixed Outlet Temperatures (before leakage):**\nThe capacity-weighted average temperatures in the outlet headers, before complete mixing and before the leak merges, are computed.\n- Mixed hot outlet temperature:\n$$ \\bar T_{h,\\mathrm{out}} = \\frac{C_{h,1} T_{h,\\mathrm{out},1} + C_{h,2} T_{h,\\mathrm{out},2}}{C_{h,1} + C_{h,2}} \\approx \\frac{(0.5)(30.74) + (3.5)(78.48)}{4.0} = \\frac{15.37 + 274.68}{4.0} = \\frac{290.05}{4.0} \\approx 72.51^\\circ\\mathrm{C} $$\n- Mixed cold outlet temperature:\n$$ \\bar T_{c,\\mathrm{out}} = \\frac{C_{c,1} T_{c,\\mathrm{out},1} + C_{c,2} T_{c,\\mathrm{out},2}}{C_{c,1} + C_{c,2}} \\approx \\frac{(1.5)(49.75) + (1.5)(56.88)}{3.0} = \\frac{74.625 + 85.32}{3.0} \\approx \\frac{159.945}{3.0} \\approx 53.32^\\circ\\mathrm{C} $$\nGlobally, before leakage, $\\bar T_{c,\\mathrm{out}} < \\bar T_{h,\\mathrm{out}}$, so installing a single temperature sensor at each outlet port would show no temperature cross.\n\n**Leakage-Mixed Cold Outlet Temperature:**\nThe hot leak stream with $C_{\\ell}=0.2\\,\\mathrm{kW/K}$ at $T_{\\ell}=90^\\circ\\mathrm{C}$ mixes with the combined cold outlet flow ($C_c = 3.0\\,\\mathrm{kW/K}$ at $\\bar T_{c,\\mathrm{out}} \\approx 53.32^\\circ\\mathrm{C}$).\n- Final cold outlet temperature after mixing, $\\tilde T_{c,\\mathrm{out}}$:\n$$ \\tilde T_{c,\\mathrm{out}} = \\frac{C_c \\bar T_{c,\\mathrm{out}} + C_{\\ell} T_{\\ell}}{C_c + C_{\\ell}} \\approx \\frac{(3.0)(53.32) + (0.2)(90)}{3.0 + 0.2} = \\frac{159.96 + 18}{3.2} = \\frac{177.96}{3.2} \\approx 55.61^\\circ\\mathrm{C} $$\nEven with the leak, the final mixed cold outlet temperature $\\tilde T_{c,\\mathrm{out}} \\approx 55.61^\\circ\\mathrm{C}$ is well below the mixed hot outlet temperature $\\bar T_{h,\\mathrm{out}} \\approx 72.51^\\circ\\mathrm{C}$.\n\n**Assessment of Local Temperature Cross at Headers:**\nThe calculation has definitively shown that the fluid exiting channel pair $1$ exhibits a local temperature cross ($T_{c,\\mathrm{out},1} > T_{h,\\mathrm{out},1}$). In the physical outlet headers, the streams from the different channels have not yet fully mixed. Therefore, it is entirely possible to measure a local cold-stream temperature that is higher than a local hot-stream temperature at adjacent locations within the headers. The numerical analysis confirms the premise of the problem.\n\nNow, each option is evaluated.\n\n**Option A:** This option states that severe hot-side maldistribution creates a pair with $C_{h,1} \\ll C_{c,1}$ and high $UA_1$, leading to a local cross $T_{c,\\mathrm{out},1}>T_{h,\\mathrm{out},1}$, while the other pair does not cross and the globally mixed temperatures also do not cross. This is precisely what was demonstrated by the quantitative analysis above. It correctly identifies the primary mechanism. The option also correctly notes that leakage further elevates cold outlet header temperatures. The proposed diagnostic plan is comprehensive and addresses all contributing factors: thermocouple rakes to map the temperature fields that reveal the local cross, differential pressure measurements to diagnose the maldistribution, a tracer test to confirm and quantify the internal leak, and IR thermography to visualize the non-uniform performance across the plate pack. This plan is experimentally sound and complete.\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\n**Option B:** This option claims that a temperature cross is possible only if the global condition $C_h < C_c$ is met. This is false. The global condition for this problem is $C_h = 4\\,\\mathrm{kW/K} > C_c = 3\\,\\mathrm{kW/K}$. Yet, the analysis proves that a local temperature cross occurs. The fundamental premise of this option is scientifically incorrect. The conclusion that only bulk terminal temperatures are needed for diagnosis is also incorrect, as these bulk measurements would conceal the phenomenon.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**Option C:** This option claims the *only* cause for such a phenomenon is axial conduction, and that it can occur without maldistribution or leakage. This is a false claim. The analysis proved that maldistribution is a sufficient cause. Axial conduction typically degrades performance and makes a temperature cross less, not more, likely. The proposed diagnostic of single thermocouples at the terminals is wholly inadequate, as it would only measure the mixed mean temperatures, which do not show a cross.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**Option D:** This option claims that maldistribution *alone* cannot create a temperature cross in a counterflow exchanger. This statement is demonstrably false, as proven by the analysis of channel pair $1$. It incorrectly proposes external heat loss as the sole cause. The proposed diagnostic of a helium sniff test is for detecting leaks to the atmosphere (external leaks), not the internal hot-to-cold leak described in the problem. The diagnostic plan ignores the primary mechanism of maldistribution.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\nThe only option that correctly identifies the physical mechanism and proposes a scientifically rigorous and comprehensive diagnostic plan is A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2515372"}, {"introduction": "While steady-state analysis is vital, understanding the transient behavior of a heat exchanger is critical for control and safety.

It presents a standard engineering task: justifying the simplification of a physical model. All necessary parameters for the requested calculations are provided. The problem is well-posed, as the calculations lead to a definite set of dimensionless numbers and time scales upon which a logical conclusion can be based. The language is objective and technical. The physical values are within a plausible range for a compact heat exchanger application. Therefore, the problem statement is valid.\n\n### Step 3: Derivation and Analysis\n\nThe problem instructs a two-part analysis to determine the appropriate model complexity.\n\n**Part 1: Biot Number Calculation**\n\nThe Biot number, $Bi$, is a dimensionless group that quantifies the ratio of the internal (conduction) resistance to the external (convection) resistance of a body. It is defined as:\n$$Bi = \\frac{h L_c}{k_s}$$\nHere, $h$ is the convective heat transfer coefficient, $L_c$ is the characteristic length of the solid, and $k_s$ is the thermal conductivity of the solid. The problem specifies the characteristic length to be the plate half-thickness, $L_c = t_{\\mathrm{p}}/2$. The solid is the titanium plate, so $k_s = k_{\\mathrm{p}}$. We must calculate a Biot number for each side of the plate.\n\nThe characteristic length is:\n$$L_c = \\frac{t_{\\mathrm{p}}}{2} = \\frac{0.80\\times 10^{-3} \\ \\mathrm{m}}{2} = 0.40\\times 10^{-3} \\ \\mathrm{m}$$\nThe Biot number for the hot side ($Bi_{\\mathrm{h}}$) is:\n$$Bi_{\\mathrm{h}} = \\frac{h_{\\mathrm{h}} L_c}{k_{\\mathrm{p}}} = \\frac{(6.00\\times 10^{3} \\ \\mathrm{W\\, m^{-2}\\, K^{-1}}) \\times (0.40\\times 10^{-3} \\ \\mathrm{m})}{7.0 \\ \\mathrm{W\\, m^{-1}\\, K^{-1}}} = \\frac{2.4}{7.0} \\approx 0.343$$\nThe Biot number for the cold side ($Bi_{\\mathrm{c}}$) is:\n$$Bi_{\\mathrm{c}} = \\frac{h_{\\mathrm{c}} L_c}{k_{\\mathrm{p}}} = \\frac{(4.00\\times 10^{3} \\ \\mathrm{W\\, m^{-2}\\, K^{-1}}) \\times (0.40\\times 10^{-3} \\ \\mathrm{m})}{7.0 \\ \\mathrm{W\\, m^{-1}\\, K^{-1}}} = \\frac{1.6}{7.0} \\approx 0.229$$\nA lumped-capacitance analysis, which assumes a spatially uniform temperature within the solid, is generally considered accurate for $Bi < 0.1$. Since both $Bi_{\\mathrm{h}}$ and $Bi_{\\mathrm{c}}$ are significantly greater than $0.1$, the temperature gradients across the plate thickness are not negligible. This implies that a model which lumps the plate into a single temperature across its thickness is inadequate. A distributed model that resolves the temperature profile through the plate thickness is, in principle, required for high accuracy.\n\n**Part 2: Time Constant Comparison**\n\nNext, we compare the thermal time constant of the plate wall with the residence time of the fluid in the channel.\n\nThe fluid residence time, $\\tau_{\\mathrm{f}}$, is the average time a fluid parcel spends in the channel. First, we calculate the average fluid velocity, $u$. The channel cross-sectional area is $A_c = W \\times b$.\n$$A_c = (0.20 \\ \\mathrm{m}) \\times (1.0\\times 10^{-3} \\ \\mathrm{m}) = 2.0\\times 10^{-4} \\ \\mathrm{m}^2$$\nThe average velocity is $u = Q / A_c$.\n$$u = \\frac{5.00\\times 10^{-4} \\ \\mathrm{m^{3}\\, s^{-1}}}{2.0\\times 10^{-4} \\ \\mathrm{m}^2} = 2.5 \\ \\mathrm{m\\, s^{-1}}$$\nThe residence time is $\\tau_{\\mathrm{f}} = L / u$.\n$$\\tau_{\\mathrm{f}} = \\frac{1.0 \\ \\mathrm{m}}{2.5 \\ \\mathrm{m\\, s^{-1}}} = 0.4 \\ \\mathrm{s}$$\n\nThe wall thermal time constant, $\\tau_{\\mathrm{w}}$, is the ratio of the wall's thermal capacitance to the total thermal conductance for heat transfer away from it. An energy balance on a lumped-temperature plate of area $dA$ is:\n$$(\\rho_{\\mathrm{p}} c_{\\mathrm{p}} t_{\\mathrm{p}} dA) \\frac{dT_{\\mathrm{p}}}{dt} = h_{\\mathrm{h}}(T_{\\mathrm{h}} - T_{\\mathrm{p}})dA + h_{\\mathrm{c}}(T_{\\mathrm{c}} - T_{\\mathrm{p}})dA$$\nRearranging gives a first-order differential equation for $T_{\\mathrm{p}}$:\n$$\\frac{dT_{\\mathrm{p}}}{dt} + \\frac{h_{\\mathrm{h}} + h_{\\mathrm{c}}}{\\rho_{\\mathrm{p}} c_{\\mathrm{p}} t_{\\mathrm{p}}} T_{\\mathrm{p}} = \\dots$$\nThe time constant $\\tau_{\\mathrm{w}}$ is the reciprocal of the coefficient of the $T_{\\mathrm{p}}$ term:\n$$\\tau_{\\mathrm{w}} = \\frac{\\rho_{\\mathrm{p}} c_{\\mathrm{p}} t_{\\mathrm{p}}}{h_{\\mathrm{h}} + h_{\\mathrm{c}}}$$\nWe calculate the numerator, which is the thermal capacitance per unit area:\n$$\\rho_{\\mathrm{p}} c_{\\mathrm{p}} t_{\\mathrm{p}} = (4.50\\times 10^{3} \\ \\mathrm{kg\\, m^{-3}}) \\times (5.20\\times 10^{2} \\ \\mathrm{J\\, kg^{-1}\\, K^{-1}}) \\times (0.80\\times 10^{-3} \\ \\mathrm{m}) = 1872 \\ \\mathrm{J\\, m^{-2}\\, K^{-1}}$$\nThe denominator is the sum of the convection coefficients:\n$$h_{\\mathrm{h}} + h_{\\mathrm{c}} = 6.00\\times 10^{3} \\ \\mathrm{W\\, m^{-2}\\, K^{-1}} + 4.00\\times 10^{3} \\ \\mathrm{W\\, m^{-2}\\, K^{-1}} = 1.0\\times 10^{4} \\ \\mathrm{W\\, m^{-2}\\, K^{-1}}$$\nThus, the wall time constant is:\n$$\\tau_{\\mathrm{w}} = \\frac{1872 \\ \\mathrm{J\\, m^{-2}\\, K^{-1}}}{1.0\\times 10^{4} \\ \\mathrm{W\\, m^{-2}\\, K^{-1}}} = 0.1872 \\ \\mathrm{s}$$\nNow we compare the time constants:\n$$\\tau_{\\mathrm{w}} = 0.1872 \\ \\mathrm{s} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\tau_{\\mathrm{f}} = 0.4 \\ \\mathrm{s}$$\nThe wall time constant is of the same order of magnitude as the fluid residence time ($\\tau_{\\mathrm{w}}/\\tau_{\\mathrm{f}} \\approx 0.47$). This indicates that the thermal response of the plate is not substantially faster or slower than the transport of energy by the fluid through the channel. If $\\tau_{\\mathrm{w}} \\ll \\tau_{\\mathrm{f}}$, one could argue for a quasi-steady-state model for the wall. If $\\tau_{\\mathrm{w}} \\gg \\tau_{\\mathrm{f}}$, the wall temperature would evolve very slowly, simplifying the initial transient analysis. Since the time scales are comparable, the transient dynamics of the wall temperature field and the fluid temperature fields are strongly coupled. This coupling, combined with the advective nature of the flow, enforces the need to resolve temperature variations along the flow direction, $x$.\n\n**Conclusion and Option Evaluation**\n\n- The finding that $Bi > 0.1$ indicates that temperature variations *across the plate thickness* are significant.\n- The finding that $\\tau_{\\mathrm{w}}$ is of the same order as $\\tau_{\\mathrm{f}}$ indicates that temperature variations *along the flow direction* for the plate cannot be decoupled from the fluid flow and must be resolved.\n\nCombining these two points leads to the conclusion that a fully distributed-parameter model, resolving temperature in both the direction of flow and the direction of plate thickness, is necessary for an accurate description of the transient response. Such a model is described by Partial Differential Equations (PDEs).\n\nNow we evaluate the given options:\n\n**A. A fully distributed-parameter model that resolves the plate temperature across its thickness and along the flow is warranted because the Biot numbers on both faces are not small and the wall thermal time constant is of the same order as the fluid residence time.**\nThis statement aligns perfectly with our analysis. The Biot numbers ($0.343$ and $0.229$) are not small. The wall time constant ($0.1872 \\ \\mathrm{s}$) is of the same order as the fluid residence time ($0.4 \\ \\mathrm{s}$). Both conditions justify the need for a distributed-parameter model resolving spatial variations in two dimensions (axial and thickness) and time.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. A lumped wall-capacitance model with spatially uniform plate temperature is adequate because the Biot numbers are below the small-value threshold; the residence time being larger than the wall time constant further supports lumping.**\nThis statement is incorrect. The first premise, \"Biot numbers are below the small-value threshold,\" is false, as our calculation shows $Bi > 0.1$. This alone invalidates the conclusion. Furthermore, the notion that $\\tau_{\\mathrm{f}} > \\tau_{\\mathrm{w}}$ supports lumping is misleading; since the time scales are comparable, a coupled, distributed model is required.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. A single well-mixed control-volume model (one node for the entire exchanger) is adequate because the wall time constant is smaller than the fluid residence time, so spatial variations can be neglected during the transient.**\nThis option proposes the most extreme simplification. The justification that $\\tau_{\\mathrm{w}} < \\tau_{\\mathrm{f}}$ allows neglecting spatial variations is physically unsound. Neglecting spatial variations along the flow path is only valid for very small Number of Transfer Units ($NTU \\ll 1$), which is not the case for a typical compact heat exchanger. The comparable time scales point to the importance of spatial effects, not their insignificance.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. A distributed-parameter model is only justified when the fluid Péclet number...is below a threshold; since compact exchangers have large Péclet numbers, lumped models are always acceptable regardless of the plate Biot number and wall time constant.**\nThis statement contains a fundamental error in logic. The Péclet number, $Pe$, represents the ratio of advection to diffusion. A large $Pe$ (which is assumed by neglecting axial conduction) means advection dominates, leading to strong temperature gradients along the flow path. This is precisely the condition that *requires* a distributed-parameter model to capture plug-flow-like behavior. A lumped model corresponds to the limit of $Pe \\to 0$ (perfect mixing). The option inverts this principle.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\nFinal conclusion based on this rigorous analysis is that only statement A is physically and mathematically consistent with the provided data.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2515409"}]}
