The analysis will be based on the fundamental principles of heat transfer, namely Fourier's law of conduction and Newton's law of cooling, under the specified steady-state, one-dimensional assumptions.\n\nThe total heat transfer rate, $Q$, across the barrier is defined by the relation $Q = U A_{\\text{ref}}(T_{h} - T_{c})$, where $A_{\\text{ref}}$ is the total reference area, and $T_{h}$ and $T_{c}$ are the temperatures of the hot and cold fluid reservoirs, respectively.

Here, we have the external convective resistance, $R_{\\text{conv,ext}}$, and the composite backing resistance, $R_{\\text{backing}}$.\n\nThe external convective resistance over an area $A$ with coefficient $h$ is given by:\n$$\nR_{\\text{conv,ext}} = \\frac{1}{hA}\n$$\nThe composite backing resistance per unit area is $R_c$, with units of $\\mathrm{m^2\\,K/W}$. The total resistance for the backing path over area $A$ is therefore:\n$$\nR_{\\text{backing}} = \\frac{R_c}{A}\n$$\nThe total resistance is the sum of these two resistances in series:\n$$\nR_{\\text{tot}} = R_{\\text{conv,ext}} + R_{\\text{backing}} = \\frac{1}{hA} + \\frac{R_c}{A} = \\frac{1+hR_c}{hA}\n$$\nBy definition, the total heat transfer rate $q$ is related to the overall heat transfer coefficient $U$ by $q = UA\\Delta T$. It is also related to the total thermal resistance by $q = \\Delta T / R_{\\text{tot}}$. Equating these two expressions for $q$ yields:\n$$\nUA\\Delta T = \\frac{\\Delta T}{R_{\\text{tot}}}\n$$\nThis implies that $UA = 1/R_{\\text{tot}}$. Substituting the expression for $R_{\\text{tot}}$:\n$$\nUA = \\frac{hA}{1+hR_c}\n$$\nDividing by the area $A$ gives the expression for the overall heat transfer coefficient $U$:\n$$\nU = \\frac{h}{1+hR_c}\n$$\nThis completes the first task.\n\n**Task 2: Formulation of the Optimization Problem**\n\nThe objective is to maximize the total heat transfer conductance, which is the product $UA$. This quantity is the objective function, $f(A, P)$.\nUsing the result from Task 1 and the given model for $h(P)$, the objective function is:\n$$\nf(A, P) = UA = A \\frac{h(P)}{1 + h(P) R_c} = A \\frac{h_{\\text{nat}} + k P^{\\beta}}{1 + (h_{\\text{nat}} + k P^{\\beta}) R_c}\n$$\nThe decision variables are the heat transfer area $A$ and the fan power $P$. The problem is subject to several constraints. The complete formulation is as follows:\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\underset{A, P}{\\text{maximize}}\n& & A \\frac{h_{\\text{nat}} + k P^{\\beta}}{1 + (h_{\\text{nat}} + k P^{\\beta}) R_c} \\\\\n& \\text{subject to}\n& & c_A A + c_P P \\le B \\\\\n& & & A \\ge 0 \\\\\n& & & P \\ge 0\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\nSince the objective function is strictly increasing with $A$ and non-decreasing with $P$, and given that $c_A, c_P, B > 0$, any optimal solution must utilize the entire budget. Therefore, the budget inequality constraint will be active at the optimum: $c_A A + c_P P = B$.\n\n**Task 3: Karush–Kuhn–Tucker (KKT) Conditions**\n\nWe formulate the Lagrangian $\\mathcal{L}$ for the equivalent minimization problem (minimizing $-UA$). The constraints are $g_1(A,P) = c_A A + c_P P - B \\le 0$, $g_2(A,P) = -A \\le 0$, and $g_3(A,P) = -P \\le 0$.\n$$\n\\mathcal{L}(A, P, \\lambda, \\mu_A, \\mu_P) = -A \\frac{h(P)}{1 + h(P) R_c} + \\lambda (c_A A + c_P P - B) - \\mu_A A - \\mu_P P\n$$\nwhere $\\lambda, \\mu_A, \\mu_P \\ge 0$ are the Lagrange multipliers.\n\nThe KKT conditions are:\n\n1.  **Stationarity**: $\\nabla \\mathcal{L} = 0$.\n    $$\n    \\frac{\\partial \\mathcal{L}}{\\partial A} = -\\frac{h(P)}{1 + h(P) R_c} + \\lambda c_A - \\mu_A = 0\n    $$\n    $$\n    \\frac{\\partial \\mathcal{L}}{\\partial P} = -A \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial P}\\left(\\frac{h(P)}{1+h(P)R_c}\\right) + \\lambda c_P - \\mu_P = 0\n    $$\n\n2.  **Primal Feasibility**:\n    $$\n    c_A A + c_P P - B \\le 0, \\quad A \\ge 0, \\quad P \\ge 0\n    $$\n\n3.  **Dual Feasibility**:\n    $$\n    \\lambda \\ge 0, \\quad \\mu_A \\ge 0, \\quad \\mu_P \\ge 0\n    $$\n\n4.  **Complementary Slackness**:\n    $$\n    \\lambda (c_A A + c_P P - B) = 0, \\quad \\mu_A A = 0, \\quad \\mu_P P = 0\n    $$\n\n**Interpretation**:\n\n- As argued previously, the budget constraint must be active, so $c_A A + c_P P = B$ and $\\lambda > 0$.\n- Since $B > 0$ and $c_A>0$, a solution with $A=0$ is suboptimal. Thus, $A>0$ and the complementary slackness condition $\\mu_A A = 0$ implies $\\mu_A = 0$.\n- The partial derivative term with respect to $P$ is calculated as:\n  $$\n  \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial P}\\left(\\frac{h(P)}{1+h(P)R_c}\\right) = \\frac{d}{dh}\\left(\\frac{h}{1+hR_c}\\right) \\frac{dh}{dP} = \\frac{1}{(1+h(P)R_c)^2} (k \\beta P^{\\beta-1})\n  $$\n- The stationarity conditions simplify to:\n  $$\n  \\lambda c_A = \\frac{h(P)}{1 + h(P) R_c} = \\frac{\\partial(UA)}{\\partial A}\n  $$\n  $$\n  \\lambda c_P - \\mu_P = A \\frac{k \\beta P^{\\beta-1}}{(1+h(P)R_c)^2} = \\frac{\\partial(UA)}{\\partial P}\n  $$\n\n- **Interior Solution ($P>0$)**: If the optimal power is positive, then $\\mu_P=0$. The conditions become:\n  $$\n  \\lambda = \\frac{1}{c_A} \\frac{\\partial(UA)}{\\partial A} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\lambda = \\frac{1}{c_P} \\frac{\\partial(UA)}{\\partial P}\n  $$\n  Equating these gives the condition for an interior optimum:\n  $$\n  \\frac{1}{c_A} \\frac{h(P)}{1 + h(P) R_c} = \\frac{1}{c_P} A \\frac{k \\beta P^{\\beta-1}}{(1+h(P)R_c)^2}\n  $$\n  This has a clear physical meaning: at the optimum allocation, the marginal increase in the objective function ($UA$) per unit cost must be identical for both resources (area and power). The multiplier $\\lambda$ represents this optimal marginal benefit per unit cost.\n\n- **Boundary Solution ($P=0$)**: This case requires careful analysis. For $\\beta \\in (0,1)$, the term $P^{\\beta-1}$ approaches infinity as $P \\to 0^+$, implying an infinite marginal return from the first infinitesimal investment in power. Thus, an optimum at $P=0$ is impossible for $\\beta < 1$. An optimum can occur at $P=0$ only if $\\beta=1$.\n  For $\\beta=1$, the derivative $\\partial(UA)/\\partial P$ is finite at $P=0$. The condition for $P^\\star=0$ is that the marginal benefit from spending on power is less than or equal to that from spending on area, evaluated at the boundary point $(A, P) = (B/c_A, 0)$.\n  $$\n  \\frac{1}{c_P}\\left.\\frac{\\partial(UA)}{\\partial P}\\right|_{P=0} \\le \\frac{1}{c_A}\\left.\\frac{\\partial(UA)}{\\partial A}\\right|_{P=0}\n  $$\n  Substituting the derivatives and $A=B/c_A$:\n  $$\n  \\frac{1}{c_P} \\frac{B}{c_A} \\frac{k}{(1+h_{\\text{nat}}R_c)^2} \\le \\frac{1}{c_A} \\frac{h_{\\text{nat}}}{1+h_{\\text{nat}}R_c}\n  $$\n  This simplifies to the condition for a $P^\\star=0$ optimum when $\\beta=1$:\n  $$\n  \\frac{B k}{c_P (1+h_{\\text{nat}}R_c)} \\le h_{\\text{nat}}\n  $$\n\n**Task 4: Algorithm Design**\n\nThe problem can be reduced to a single-variable optimization. Since the budget constraint is active, we write $A$ as a function of $P$:\n$$\nA(P) = \\frac{B - c_P P}{c_A}\n$$\nThe domain for $P$ is $[0, B/c_P]$. Substituting this into the objective function yields a function of $P$ only:\n$$\nF(P) \\equiv (UA)(P) = \\left(\\frac{B - c_P P}{c_A}\\right) \\frac{h(P)}{1 + h(P) R_c}\n$$\nTo find the maximum, we set the derivative $F'(P)=0$. This leads to the equation:\n$$\n(B - c_P P) k \\beta P^{\\beta-1} - c_P h(P) (1 + h(P)R_c) = 0\n$$\nwhere $h(P) = h_{\\text{nat}} + k P^{\\beta}$. Let us define the function $G(P)$ for which we seek a root:\n$$\nG(P) = (B - c_P P) k \\beta P^{\\beta-1} - c_P h(P) (1 + h(P)R_c)\n$$\nThe algorithm proceeds as follows:\n1.  Check if $\\beta=1$. If so, evaluate $G(0) = B k - c_P h_{\\text{nat}}(1+h_{\\text{nat}}R_c)$. If $G(0) \\le 0$, the optimum is $P^\\star=0$. Calculate $A^\\star = B/c_A$ and $(UA)^\\star$ accordingly.\n2.  Otherwise (if $\\beta<1$, or if $\\beta=1$ and $G(0)>0$), an interior solution $P^\\star \\in (0, B/c_P)$ exists. This is because $G(P \\to 0^+) > 0$ and $G(B/c_P) < 0$, guaranteeing a root in the interval.\n3.  Use a robust numerical root-finding method, such as Brent's method, to solve $G(P)=0$ for $P$ within a search interval such as $[\\epsilon, B/c_P - \\epsilon]$ for a small $\\epsilon>0$.\n4.  Once the optimal power $P^\\star$ is found, the optimal area is calculated as $A^\\star = (B - c_P P^\\star) / c_A$.\n5.  Finally, the maximized objective is calculated as $(UA)^\\star = A^\\star \\frac{h(P^\\star)}{1 + h(P^\\star) R_c}$.\nThis algorithm is robust and handles all cases defined by the problem parameters.\n\n**Task 5: Numerical Implementation and Solutions**\n\nThe described algorithm is now implemented to solve the specific test cases.
