All provided parameters are physically realistic and the problem statement is self-contained and well-posed. The problem is therefore deemed valid and a solution will be provided.\n\n(a) Derivation of Scaling Laws\n\nFirst, we establish the relationship between the total volumetric flow rate, $Q_T$, and the flow in a single tube. By conservation of mass, and given the uniform distribution of flow among $N_t$ identical parallel tubes, the volumetric flow rate per tube, $Q_1$, is:\n$$Q_1 = \\frac{Q_T}{N_t}$$\nThe average flow velocity, $v$, within a single tube of inner diameter $d$ and cross-sectional area $A = \\frac{\\pi d^2}{4}$ is:\n$$v = \\frac{Q_1}{A} = \\frac{Q_T / N_t}{\\pi d^2 / 4} = \\frac{4 Q_T}{\\pi d^2 N_t}$$\nThe Reynolds number, $\\mathrm{Re}$, is defined as $\\mathrm{Re} = \\frac{\\rho v d}{\\mu}$. Substituting the expression for the velocity $v$:\n$$\\mathrm{Re} = \\frac{\\rho d}{\\mu} \\left( \\frac{4 Q_T}{\\pi d^2 N_t} \\right) = \\frac{4 \\rho Q_T}{\\pi \\mu d N_t}$$\nSince the quantities $\\rho$, $Q_T$, $\\mu$, and $d$ are all fixed constants, we can express the Reynolds number's dependence on the number of tubes $N_t$ as:\n$$\\mathrm{Re} \\propto \\frac{1}{N_t} \\quad \\text{or} \\quad \\mathrm{Re} \\propto N_t^{-1}$$\nThis is the scaling law for the per-tube Reynolds number.\n\nNext, we analyze the pressure drop, $\\Delta p$. The Darcy-Weisbach equation for pressure drop in a fully developed flow through a straight tube of length $L$ is:\n$$\\Delta p = f \\frac{L}{d} \\frac{\\rho v^2}{2}$$\nwhere $f$ is the Darcy friction factor. We substitute the expression for velocity $v$:\n$$\\Delta p = f \\frac{L}{d} \\frac{\\rho}{2} \\left( \\frac{4 Q_T}{\\pi d^2 N_t} \\right)^2 = f \\left( \\frac{8 \\rho L Q_T^2}{\\pi^2 d^5} \\right) N_t^{-2}$$\nThe problem states that for the turbulent regime, the friction factor is given by a power-law correlation of the form $f = a \\, \\mathrm{Re}^{-m}$, where $a$ and $m$ are positive constants. We substitute our derived scaling for the Reynolds number into this correlation:\n$$f = a \\left( C \\cdot N_t^{-1} \\right)^{-m} = a \\, C^{-m} N_t^m$$\nwhere $C = \\frac{4 \\rho Q_T}{\\pi \\mu d}$ is a constant. Thus, the friction factor scales as $f \\propto N_t^m$.\n\nFinally, we substitute the scaling of $f$ into the expression for $\\Delta p$:\n$$\\Delta p \\propto f \\cdot N_t^{-2} \\propto (N_t^m) \\cdot (N_t^{-2}) = N_t^{m-2}$$\nThe scaling exponent for the per-tube pressure drop with respect to the number of tubes $N_t$ is therefore $(m-2)$.\n\n(b) Calculation of the Minimum Number of Tubes\n\nFor this part, we are given the Blasius smooth-tube correlation, $f = 0.316 \\, \\mathrm{Re}^{-0.25}$. Comparing this to the general form $f = a \\, \\mathrm{Re}^{-m}$, we identify the constants as $a = 0.316$ and $m = 0.25$.\nUsing the scaling law derived in part (a), the pressure drop scales as:\n$$\\Delta p \\propto N_t^{0.25 - 2} = N_t^{-1.75}$$\nWe must find the minimum integer number of tubes $N_t$ such that the per-tube pressure drop $\\Delta p$ does not exceed the maximum allowed value, $\\Delta p_{\\max} = 30000$ Pa. The condition is $\\Delta p \\le \\Delta p_{\\max}$.\n\nWe write the full expression for $\\Delta p$ by substituting all constitutive relations:\n$$\\Delta p = f \\frac{L}{d} \\frac{\\rho v^2}{2} = (a \\, \\mathrm{Re}^{-m}) \\frac{L}{d} \\frac{\\rho}{2} v^2$$\nSubstitute the expressions for $\\mathrm{Re}$ and $v$ in terms of $N_t$ and the given parameters:\n$$\\Delta p = a \\left( \\frac{4 \\rho Q_T}{\\pi \\mu d N_t} \\right)^{-m} \\frac{L}{d} \\frac{\\rho}{2} \\left( \\frac{4 Q_T}{\\pi d^2 N_t} \\right)^2$$\nWe require $\\Delta p \\le \\Delta p_{\\max}$. To find the minimum number of tubes, we solve for $N_t$ at the limit where $\\Delta p = \\Delta p_{\\max}$.

For $N_t = 8$:\n$$\\mathrm{Re} = \\frac{C_{\\mathrm{Re}}}{N_t} = \\frac{211568.14}{8} \\approx 26446$$\nThis Reynolds number is squarely in the turbulent regime and well within the accepted range for the Blasius correlation. The use of the correlation is therefore justified for the resulting design.

Since the flow is turbulent in a hydraulically smooth tube, we use the Petukhov correlation for the friction factor, which is accurate for $3000 \\le \\mathrm{Re} \\le 5 \\times 10^6$:\n$$f = (0.790 \\ln(\\mathrm{Re}) - 1.64)^{-2}$$\nWe must calculate two Reynolds numbers, one for each viscosity evaluation.\nThe term $\\rho u D$ is constant:\n$$\\rho u D = 800 \\times \\frac{25}{\\pi} \\times 0.020 = \\frac{400}{\\pi}\\ \\mathrm{kg/(m\\cdot s)}$$\n\nFor properties evaluated at the bulk-mean temperature:\n$$\\mathrm{Re}_b = \\frac{\\rho u D}{\\mu_b} = \\frac{400/\\pi}{8.642 \\times 10^{-3}} \\approx 14733$$\nThis Reynolds number is within the turbulent regime. The corresponding friction factor is:\n$$f_b = (0.790 \\ln(14733) - 1.64)^{-2} \\approx (0.790 \\times 9.5979 - 1.64)^{-2} \\approx 0.02831$$\nThe pressure drop is $\\Delta p_{\\mathrm{bulk}} = f_b \\frac{L}{D} \\frac{\\rho u^2}{2}$.\n\nFor properties evaluated at the wall temperature:\n$$\\mathrm{Re}_w = \\frac{\\rho u D}{\\mu_w} = \\frac{400/\\pi}{2.767 \\times 10^{-3}} \\approx 46015$$\nThis Reynolds number is also turbulent. The corresponding friction factor is:\n$$f_w = (0.790 \\ln(46015) - 1.64)^{-2} \\approx (0.790 \\times 10.7367 - 1.64)^{-2} \\approx 0.02136$$\nThe pressure drop is $\\Delta p_{\\mathrm{wall}} = f_w \\frac{L}{D} \\frac{\\rho u^2}{2}$.\n\nThe bracketing uncertainty factor $U$ is defined as:\n$$U = \\frac{\\max\\{\\Delta p_{\\mathrm{bulk}},\\ \\Delta p_{\\mathrm{wall}}\\}}{\\min\\{\\Delta p_{\\mathrm{bulk}},\\ \\Delta p_{\\mathrm{wall}}\\}}$$\nSince the term $\\frac{L}{D} \\frac{\\rho u^2}{2}$ is common to both pressure drop calculations, the ratio simplifies to a ratio of the friction factors:\n$$U = \\frac{\\max\\{f_b, f_w\\}}{\\min\\{f_b, f_w\\}}$$\nFrom our calculations, $f_b \\approx 0.02831$ and $f_w \\approx 0.02136$. Thus, $f_b > f_w$.\n$$U = \\frac{f_b}{f_w} = \\frac{0.02831}{0.02136} \\approx 1.32537$$\nRounding to three significant figures, the result is $1.33$.\nThis factor quantifies the sensitivity of the pressure drop calculation to the choice of temperature at which fluid properties are evaluated. The large temperature difference between the bulk fluid and the wall, combined with the strong temperature dependence of viscosity, leads to a significant difference in the predicted pressure drop.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{1.33}$$", "id": "2516108"}]}
