This equation is separable. We rearrange the terms to separate the variables $R_f$ and $t$:\n$$\n\\frac{dR_{f}}{k_{d} - k_{r}R_{f}} = dt\n$$\nWe integrate both sides. The integration on the left side is from $R_{f}(0)=0$ to $R_{f}(t)$, and on the right side from time $0$ to $t$:\n$$\n\\int_{0}^{R_{f}(t)} \\frac{dR'_{f}}{k_{d} - k_{r}R'_{f}} = \\int_{0}^{t} dt'\n$$\nThe integral on the right side is simply $t$. The integral on the left side is evaluated as:\n$$\n\\left[ -\\frac{1}{k_{r}}\\ln|k_{d} - k_{r}R'_{f}| \\right]_{0}^{R_{f}(t)} = t\n$$\nSince $R_f(t)$ starts at $0$ and increases towards its asymptotic value, the term $k_d - k_r R_f$ will remain positive, so the absolute value can be dropped. Applying the limits of integration:\n$$\n-\\frac{1}{k_{r}} \\left( \\ln(k_{d} - k_{r}R_{f}(t)) - \\ln(k_{d}) \\right) = t\n$$\nUsing the properties of logarithms, we combine the terms:\n$$\n-\\frac{1}{k_{r}} \\ln\\left(\\frac{k_{d} - k_{r}R_{f}(t)}{k_{d}}\\right) = t\n$$\nMultiplying by $-k_{r}$ and exponentiating both sides gives:\n$$\n\\frac{k_{d} - k_{r}R_{f}(t)}{k_{d}} = \\exp(-k_{r} t)\n$$\n$$\n1 - \\frac{k_{r}}{k_{d}}R_{f}(t) = \\exp(-k_{r} t)\n$$\nSolving for $R_{f}(t)$:\n$$\nR_{f}(t) = \\frac{k_{d}}{k_{r}}\\left(1 - \\exp(-k_{r} t)\\right)\n$$\nThis is the expression for the fouling resistance as a function of time.\n\nNext, we determine the asymptotic fouling resistance, $R_{f,\\infty}$, by taking the limit as $t \\to \\infty$:\n$$\nR_{f,\\infty} = \\lim_{t \\to \\infty} R_{f}(t) = \\lim_{t \\to \\infty} \\left[\\frac{k_{d}}{k_{r}}\\left(1 - \\exp(-k_{r} t)\\right)\\right]\n$$\nSince $k_{r} > 0$, the term $\\exp(-k_{r} t)$ approaches $0$ as $t \\to \\infty$. Therefore:\n$$\nR_{f,\\infty} = \\frac{k_{d}}{k_{r}}\n$$\nThis result can also be obtained by setting the rate of change to zero in the original differential equation, which corresponds to the steady-state or asymptotic condition: $0 = k_{d} - k_{r}R_{f,\\infty}$, which yields $R_{f,\\infty} = k_{d}/k_{r}$.\n\nNow, we must find the time $t_{0.9}$ at which $R_{f}(t)$ reaches $90\\%$ of its asymptotic value, i.e., $R_{f}(t_{0.9}) = 0.9 R_{f,\\infty}$.\nSubstituting the expressions for $R_{f}(t)$ and $R_{f,\\infty}$:\n$$\n\\frac{k_{d}}{k_{r}}\\left(1 - \\exp(-k_{r} t_{0.9})\\right) = 0.9 \\left(\\frac{k_{d}}{k_{r}}\\right)\n$$\nThe non-zero term $k_{d}/k_{r}$ cancels from both sides:\n$$\n1 - \\exp(-k_{r} t_{0.9}) = 0.9\n$$\nRearranging the terms to solve for the exponential:\n$$\n\\exp(-k_{r} t_{0.9}) = 1 - 0.9 = 0.1\n$$\nTaking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n$$\n-k_{r} t_{0.9} = \\ln(0.1) = \\ln(10^{-1}) = -\\ln(10)\n$$\nSolving for $t_{0.9}$:\n$$\nt_{0.9} = \\frac{\\ln(10)}{k_{r}}\n$$\nFinally, we substitute the definition $\\beta \\equiv k_{r}$ into this expression:\n$$\nt_{0.9} = \\frac{\\ln(10)}{\\beta}\n$$\nThe units of $\\beta$ are inverse time, so the units of $t_{0.9}$ are time. If $\\beta$ is given in units of $s^{-1}$, then $t_{0.9}$ will be in seconds, as requested.\n\nFor the qualitative discussion:\nThe parameter $\\beta$, equivalent to $k_r$, represents the rate constant for the shear-driven removal of foulant from the heat transfer surface. This removal process is a direct consequence of the fluid dynamic forces exerted by the flow on the deposited layer. The primary force responsible for this detachment is the fluid shear stress at the wall, $\\tau_{w}$.\n1.  **Effect on $\\beta$**: An increase in the bulk fluid velocity or turbulence intensity leads to a higher wall shear stress $\\tau_{w}$. A greater shear stress imparts a larger tangential force on the foulant deposits, increasing the probability and rate of their detachment and re-entrainment into the fluid. Therefore, an increase in wall shear will strengthen the removal mechanism. In the context of the model, this corresponds to an increase in the value of the removal rate constant $k_r$. As $\\beta \\equiv k_r$, increasing wall shear directly increases $\\beta$.\n2.  **Effect on $t_{0.9}$**: The time to reach $90\\%$ of the asymptotic fouling resistance is given by $t_{0.9} = \\frac{\\ln(10)}{\\beta}$. Since $\\beta$ appears in the denominator of this expression, an increase in $\\beta$ will cause a decrease in $t_{0.9}$.\n3.  **Explanation**: A higher wall shear not only leads to a lower final amount of fouling accumulation (since $R_{f,\\infty} = k_d/\\beta$ decreases), but it also accelerates the approach to this new, lower equilibrium state. The system reaches its dynamic balance between deposition and removal more quickly when the removal process is more vigorous. Consequently, the time required to reach any given fraction of the asymptotic fouling level, such as $t_{0.9}$, is reduced.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\frac{\\ln(10)}{\\beta}}\n$$", "id": "2489349"}, {"introduction": "Analytical models are powerful, but their practical utility depends on our ability to determine their parameters from real-world measurements.

The model is $y_{\\text{model}}(t_i; \\alpha, \\beta) = U(t_i; \\alpha, \\beta) = \\frac{1}{R_{0,B} + R_f(t_i; \\alpha, \\beta)}$. The objective function is:\n$$\nS_B(\\alpha, \\beta) = \\sum_i \\left( \\frac{\\left(R_{0,B} + \\frac{\\alpha}{\\beta}(1 - e^{-\\beta t_i})\\right)^{-1} - U_{\\text{meas}}(t_i)}{\\sigma_B} \\right)^2\n$$\nThe estimation procedure is analogous to Case A.\n\nCase C: Indirect estimation from $U(t)$ data with unknown $R_0$ and identifiability analysis.\nThe parameter vector is now expanded to $\\theta = [\\alpha, \\beta, R_0]^\\top$. The model is $y_{\\text{model}}(t_i; \\alpha, \\beta, R_0) = U(t_i) = \\frac{1}{R_0 + R_f(t_i; \\alpha, \\beta)}$. The objective function is:\n$$\nS_C(\\alpha, \\beta, R_0) = \\sum_i \\left( \\frac{\\left(R_0 + \\frac{\\alpha}{\\beta}(1 - e^{-\\beta t_i})\\right)^{-1} - U_{\\text{meas}}(t_i)}{\\sigma_C} \\right)^2\n$$\nAfter finding the least-squares estimate $\\hat{\\theta} = [\\hat{\\alpha}, \\hat{\\beta}, \\hat{R_0}]^\\top$, we assess practical parameter identifiability. This is evaluated by examining the sensitivity of the model output to parameter variations, quantified by the Jacobian matrix of the residual vector, $J(\\theta)$. The components of this matrix are $J_{ij} = \\frac{\\partial r_i}{\\partial \\theta_j}$, where $r_i$ is the $i$-th normalized residual.\n$$\nr_i(\\theta) = \\frac{U(t_i; \\theta) - U_{\\text{meas}}(t_i)}{\\sigma_C} \\implies J_{ij} = \\frac{1}{\\sigma_C} \\frac{\\partial U(t_i; \\theta)}{\\partial \\theta_j}\n$$\nThe partial derivatives of $U$ with respect to the parameters are required:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial U}{\\partial \\alpha} = -\\frac{1}{(R_0 + R_f)^2} \\frac{\\partial R_f}{\\partial \\alpha} = -\\frac{1}{(R_0 + R_f)^2} \\left[ \\frac{1}{\\beta}(1 - e^{-\\beta t}) \\right]\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial U}{\\partial \\beta} = -\\frac{1}{(R_0 + R_f)^2} \\frac{\\partial R_f}{\\partial \\beta} = -\\frac{1}{(R_0 + R_f)^2} \\left[ -\\frac{\\alpha}{\\beta^2}(1 - e^{-\\beta t}) + \\frac{\\alpha t}{\\beta}e^{-\\beta t} \\right]\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial U}{\\partial R_0} = -\\frac{1}{(R_0 + R_f)^2}\n$$\nA large condition number of the Jacobian matrix $J(\\hat{\\theta})$ indicates that its columns are nearly linearly dependent, implying that the effects of changing different parameters on the model output are highly correlated. This makes it difficult to uniquely determine the parameter values from the data, a condition known as practical non-identifiability. We will compute the $2$-norm condition number of $J(\\hat{\\theta})$ and compare it to the specified threshold of $10^{10}$. For Case C, the measurement timespan $t \\in [0, 2.0\\times 10^5\\ \\mathrm{s}]$ is short compared to the fouling time constant $1/\\beta_C = 10^7\\ \\mathrm{s}$. In this regime ($\\beta t \\ll 1$), the fouling model $R_f(t) \\approx \\alpha t$. The overall model becomes $U(t) \\approx (R_0 + \\alpha t)^{-1}$, where the influence of $\\beta$ is minimal. It is therefore anticipated that $\\beta$ will be poorly identifiable, leading to a large condition number.", "answer": "[1.003451e-07,9.985214e-06,7.951234e-08,5.023456e-06,False]", "id": "2489406"}]}
