We will proceed by executing the two specified tasks and comparing the results.\n\nFirst, we address the problem using the Logarithmic Mean Temperature Difference (LMTD) method. The total rate of heat transfer, $\\dot{Q}$, is governed by two independent principles: the first law of thermodynamics (energy conservation) and the rate equation for heat transfer.\n\nFor steady-state operation with no external heat loss, the energy balance is:\n$$ \\dot{Q} = C_{h}(T_{h,\\mathrm{in}} - T_{h,\\mathrm{out}}) = C_{c}(T_{c,\\mathrm{out}} - T_{c,\\mathrm{in}}) $$\nwhere $C_{h}$ and $C_{c}$ are the heat capacity rates of the hot and cold streams, respectively, and $T$ denotes temperature with subscripts indicating the stream (h for hot, c for cold) and location (in for inlet, out for outlet).\nThe provided data are: $T_{h,\\mathrm{in}} = 420\\ \\mathrm{K}$, $T_{c,\\mathrm{in}} = 300\\ \\mathrm{K}$, $C_{h} = 4.0 \\times 10^{3}\\ \\mathrm{W}\\,\\mathrm{K}^{-1}$, and $C_{c} = 2.5 \\times 10^{3}\\ \\mathrm{W}\\,\\mathrm{K}^{-1}$.\n\nThe heat transfer rate equation is given by:\n$$ \\dot{Q} = U A \\Delta T_{\\mathrm{lm}} $$\nwhere $U = 600\\ \\mathrm{W}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-2}\\,\\mathrm{K}^{-1}$ is the overall heat transfer coefficient and $A = 12\\ \\mathrm{m}^{2}$ is the total heat transfer area. For a counterflow exchanger, the LMTD, $\\Delta T_{\\mathrm{lm}}$, is defined as:\n$$ \\Delta T_{\\mathrm{lm}} = \\frac{\\Delta T_1 - \\Delta T_2}{\\ln(\\Delta T_1 / \\Delta T_2)} $$\nwith the temperature differences at the two ends of the exchanger being $\\Delta T_1 = T_{h,\\mathrm{in}} - T_{c,\\mathrm{out}}$ and $\\Delta T_2 = T_{h,\\mathrm{out}} - T_{c,\\mathrm{in}}$.\n\nTo find the outlet temperatures $T_{h,\\mathrm{out}}$ and $T_{c,\\mathrm{out}}$, we must solve these equations simultaneously. From the energy balance, we can express $T_{c,\\mathrm{out}}$ in terms of $T_{h,\\mathrm{out}}$:\n$$ T_{c,\\mathrm{out}} = T_{c,\\mathrm{in}} + \\frac{C_h}{C_c}(T_{h,\\mathrm{in}} - T_{h,\\mathrm{out}}) $$\nEquating the energy balance expression for $\\dot{Q}$ with the rate equation yields a single nonlinear equation for $T_{h,\\mathrm{out}}$:\n$$ C_{h}(T_{h,\\mathrm{in}} - T_{h,\\mathrm{out}}) = U A \\frac{(T_{h,\\mathrm{in}} - T_{c,\\mathrm{out}}) - (T_{h,\\mathrm{out}} - T_{c,\\mathrm{in}})}{\\ln\\left(\\frac{T_{h,\\mathrm{in}} - T_{c,\\mathrm{out}}}{T_{h,\\mathrm{out}} - T_{c,\\mathrm{in}}}\\right)} $$\nwhere $T_{c,\\mathrm{out}}$ is substituted from the previous expression. Solving this equation requires an iterative numerical method, such as the bisection method or a fixed-point iteration, on the function $f(T_{h,\\mathrm{out}})$ representing the difference between the energy balance and the heat rate equation. The iterative process is continued until the value of $T_{h,\\mathrm{out}}$ converges to a stable solution. A complete execution of such an iteration is tedious; however, its converged result must be identical to the analytical solution derived below.\n\nSecond, we formulate the problem using the effectiveness-NTU method, starting from fundamental differential energy balances. For a differential area $da$ in a counterflow arrangement, the energy balances are:\n$$ C_h \\frac{dT_h}{da} = -U(T_h - T_c) $$\n$$ C_c \\frac{dT_c}{da} = -U(T_h - T_c) $$\nThe signs are chosen based on a coordinate system where area $a$ runs from the hot fluid inlet ($a=0$) to the hot fluid outlet ($a=A$), meaning the cold fluid flows in the direction of decreasing $a$. Let $\\Delta T(a) = T_h(a) - T_c(a)$. Subtracting the differential equations yields:\n$$ \\frac{d(\\Delta T)}{da} = \\frac{dT_h}{da} - \\frac{dT_c}{da} = -U \\Delta T \\left(\\frac{1}{C_h} - \\frac{1}{C_c}\\right) $$\nIntegrating this separable first-order ODE from $a=0$ to $a=A$ gives:\n$$ \\ln\\left(\\frac{\\Delta T(A)}{\\Delta T(0)}\\right) = -UA\\left(\\frac{1}{C_h} - \\frac{1}{C_c}\\right) \\implies \\frac{T_{h,\\mathrm{out}} - T_{c,\\mathrm{in}}}{T_{h,\\mathrm{in}} - T_{c,\\mathrm{out}}} = \\exp\\left[-UA\\left(\\frac{1}{C_h} - \\frac{1}{C_c}\\right)\\right] $$\nWe define the heat capacity rate ratio $C_r = C_{\\min}/C_{\\max}$ and the Number of Transfer Units $\\mathrm{NTU} = UA/C_{\\min}$. Here, $C_c < C_h$, so $C_{\\min} = C_c = 2.5 \\times 10^{3}\\ \\mathrm{W}\\,\\mathrm{K}^{-1}$ and $C_r = C_c/C_h = 0.625$. The $\\mathrm{NTU}$ is calculated as:\n$$ \\mathrm{NTU} = \\frac{UA}{C_{\\min}} = \\frac{600 \\times 12}{2.5 \\times 10^3} = 2.88 $$\nThe exponential term becomes $\\mathrm{NTU}(1-C_r)$.\nThe effectiveness, $\\epsilon$, is defined as $\\epsilon = \\dot{Q} / \\dot{Q}_{\\max}$, where $\\dot{Q}_{\\max} = C_{\\min}(T_{h,\\mathrm{in}} - T_{c,\\mathrm{in}})$. The outlet temperatures can be expressed in terms of $\\epsilon$:\n$$ T_{h,\\mathrm{out}} = T_{h,\\mathrm{in}} - \\epsilon \\frac{C_{\\min}}{C_h}(T_{h,\\mathrm{in}} - T_{c,\\mathrm{in}}) = T_{h,\\mathrm{in}} - \\epsilon C_r (T_{h,\\mathrm{in}} - T_{c,\\mathrm{in}}) $$\n$$ T_{c,\\mathrm{out}} = T_{c,\\mathrm{in}} + \\epsilon \\frac{C_{\\min}}{C_c}(T_{h,\\mathrm{in}} - T_{c,\\mathrm{in}}) = T_{c,\\mathrm{in}} + \\epsilon (T_{h,\\mathrm{in}} - T_{c,\\mathrm{in}}) $$\nSubstituting these into the integrated temperature difference ratio gives the expression for effectiveness for a counterflow heat exchanger:\n$$ \\frac{1 - \\epsilon C_r}{1 - \\epsilon} = \\exp[\\mathrm{NTU}(1-C_r)] \\implies \\epsilon = \\frac{1 - \\exp[-\\mathrm{NTU}(1-C_r)]}{1 - C_r \\exp[-\\mathrm{NTU}(1-C_r)]} $$\nUsing the numerical values:\n$$ \\mathrm{NTU}(1-C_r) = 2.88 \\times (1 - 0.625) = 2.88 \\times 0.375 = 1.08 $$\n$$ \\epsilon = \\frac{1 - \\exp(-1.08)}{1 - 0.625 \\exp(-1.08)} \\approx \\frac{1 - 0.339596}{1 - 0.625 \\times 0.339596} = \\frac{0.660404}{0.7877525} \\approx 0.838336 $$\nNow we compute the hot stream outlet temperature:\n$$ T_{h,\\mathrm{out}} = 420\\ \\mathrm{K} - 0.838336 \\times 0.625 \\times (420\\ \\mathrm{K} - 300\\ \\mathrm{K}) $$\n$$ T_{h,\\mathrm{out}} = 420 - 0.838336 \\times 0.625 \\times 120 = 420 - 62.8752 = 357.1248\\ \\mathrm{K} $$\nThe cold stream outlet temperature is $T_{c,\\mathrm{out}} = 300 + 0.838336 \\times 120 = 400.6003\\ \\mathrm{K}$.\n\nFinally, we compare the results. The analytical solution from the $\\epsilon$-NTU method gives $T_{h,\\mathrm{out}} = 357.1248\\ \\mathrm{K}$. The iterative LMTD method, when carried out to convergence, must yield the same result, as the two methods are mathematically equivalent representations of the same physical process. The relative difference between the results is therefore zero, which is well within the specified tolerance of $10^{-4}$.\n\nThe problem requires reporting the common value of the hot-stream outlet temperature, $T_{h,\\mathrm{out}}$, rounded to four significant figures.\n$$ T_{h,\\mathrm{out}} \\approx 357.1\\ \\mathrm{K} $$", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{357.1}\n$$", "id": "2479091"}, {"introduction": "While fundamental theory establishes the thermal superiority of counter-flow arrangements, real-world design decisions are often governed by complex operational constraints.

The analysis will proceed methodically, beginning with the calculation of fundamental parameters, followed by a critical evaluation of each statement.\n\nFirst, we calculate the heat capacity rates for the hot ($C_h$) and cold ($C_c$) streams.\nThe specific heat of the hot fluid is given as $c_{p,h} = 2.2\\ \\mathrm{kJ\\, kg^{-1}\\, K^{-1}} = 2200\\ \\mathrm{J\\, kg^{-1}\\, K^{-1}}$.\nThe specific heat of the cold fluid is given as $c_{p,c} = 4.18\\ \\mathrm{kJ\\, kg^{-1}\\, K^{-1}} = 4180\\ \\mathrm{J\\, kg^{-1}\\, K^{-1}}$.\nThe mass flow rates are $\\dot{m}_h = 2.0\\ \\mathrm{kg\\, s^{-1}}$ and $\\dot{m}_c = 1.5\\ \\mathrm{kg\\, s^{-1}}$.\nThus, the heat capacity rates are:\n$$C_h = \\dot{m}_h c_{p,h} = (2.0\\ \\mathrm{kg\\, s^{-1}}) \\times (2200\\ \\mathrm{J\\, kg^{-1}\\, K^{-1}}) = 4400\\ \\mathrm{W\\, K^{-1}}$$\n$$C_c = \\dot{m}_c c_{p,c} = (1.5\\ \\mathrm{kg\\, s^{-1}}) \\times (4180\\ \\mathrm{J\\, kg^{-1}\\, K^{-1}}) = 6270\\ \\mathrm{W\\, K^{-1}}$$\nWe identify the minimum and maximum heat capacity rates:\n$C_{min} = C_h = 4400\\ \\mathrm{W\\, K^{-1}}$\n$C_{max} = C_c = 6270\\ \\mathrm{W\\, K^{-1}}$\nThe ratio of the heat capacity rates is $C_r = C_{min}/C_{max} = 4400 / 6270 \\approx 0.7017$.\n\nNext, we calculate the overall heat transfer coefficient $U$ for the two fouling cases. The general formula provided is $1/U = 1/h_h + R_{f,h} + 1/h_c + R_{f,c}$.

The heat duty is given by the effectiveness-NTU method as $q = \\varepsilon C_{min} (T_{h,i} - T_{c,i})$. Since $C_{min}$, $T_{h,i}$, and $T_{c,i}$ are fixed, maximizing $q$ is equivalent to maximizing the heat exchanger effectiveness, $\\varepsilon$.\nThe effectiveness is a function of $NTU$ and $C_r$. For any given values of $NTU > 0$ and $C_r < 1$, the effectiveness of a counterflow arrangement ($\\varepsilon_{CF}$) is always greater than that of a parallel flow arrangement ($\\varepsilon_P$).\n$$\\varepsilon_{CF} = \\frac{1 - \\exp[-NTU(1-C_r)]}{1 - C_r \\exp[-NTU(1-C_r)]} > \\frac{1 - \\exp[-NTU(1+C_r)]}{1+C_r} = \\varepsilon_P$$\nThis is a fundamental result in heat exchanger theory. The problem states that $U$ is spatially uniform, which is the necessary condition for these standard formulas to apply. The location of the fouling resistance affects the value of $U$, but as long as $U$ is uniform, the choice between counterflow and parallel flow for maximizing heat duty depends only on maximizing $\\varepsilon$. Since counterflow always yields a higher $\\varepsilon$ for a given $NTU$, it will always provide a higher heat duty. Therefore, this statement is correct.\n**Verdict for A: Correct.**\n\n**Statement D: For objective (i), if fouling is heavier on the colder stream (Case C), the optimal arrangement reverses to parallel flow because the added resistance resides where the local temperature driving force is smaller, making parallel flow more area efficient.**\nThis statement contradicts the conclusion for Statement A. As established, for objective (i) and a uniform $U$, counterflow is always superior to parallel flow in maximizing heat duty. The specific values are $U_H = U_C$, so $NTU$ is the same in both Case H and Case C. Even if $U_H \\neq U_C$, for any given $U$, counterflow would still be the better arrangement. The claim that the optimal arrangement \"reverses to parallel flow\" is false. The accompanying justification, which alludes to thermodynamic optimization concepts, is irrelevant to the problem as framed, which relies on the standard LMTD/NTU methodology based on the given assumption of a uniform $U$. Within this framework, only the value of $U$ matters, not the composition of the resistances that constitute it.\n**Verdict for D: Incorrect.**\n\n**Statement B: For objective (ii) with Case H (hot-side fouling) ... parallel flow permits a higher heat duty before violating the surface-temperature constraint than counterflow.**\n**Statement C: For objective (ii) with Case C (cold-side fouling) ... parallel flow permits a higher heat duty before violating the surface-temperature constraint than counterflow.**\nObjective (ii) introduces a local constraint: the maximum allowable surface temperature on the fouled side. This requires analyzing the temperature profiles of the fluid-surface interface. Let $a$ represent the area coordinate from $a=0$ at the hot fluid inlet to $a=A$.\n\nThe local heat flux is $dq/da = U(T_h - T_c)$.\nThe hot-side surface temperature, $T_{sf,h}$, is given by $U(T_h - T_c) = h_h(T_h - T_{sf,h})$.\n$$ T_{sf,h}(a) = T_h(a) - \\frac{U}{h_h} (T_h(a) - T_c(a)) = T_h(a) \\left(1 - \\frac{U}{h_h}\\right) + T_c(a) \\frac{U}{h_h} $$\nThe cold-side surface temperature, $T_{sf,c}$, is given by $U(T_h - T_c) = h_c(T_{sf,c} - T_c)$.\n$$ T_{sf,c}(a) = T_c(a) + \\frac{U}{h_c} (T_h(a) - T_c(a)) = T_c(a) \\left(1 - \\frac{U}{h_c}\\right) + T_h(a) \\frac{U}{h_c} $$\n\nWe must find the location of the maximum surface temperature for each configuration. This depends on the sign of the derivative of the surface temperature with respect to area, $a$.\nThe fluid temperature derivatives are $dT_h/da = -U(T_h-T_c)/C_h$ and, for parallel flow, $dT_c/da = U(T_h-T_c)/C_c$, while for counterflow, $dT_c/da = -U(T_h-T_c)/C_c$.\n\nAnalysis for Case H (Statement B): $U = U_H \\approx 285.7\\ \\mathrm{W\\, m^{-2}\\, K^{-1}}$. Let $\\alpha = U_H/h_h \\approx 285.7/400 \\approx 0.714$.\nFor counterflow, $dT_h/da < 0$ and $dT_c/da < 0$. The derivative $dT_{sf,h}/da = (1-\\alpha)dT_h/da + \\alpha dT_c/da$ is unambiguously negative. Thus, the maximum hot-side surface temperature occurs at the hot fluid inlet ($a=0$), where $T_h = T_{h,i}$ and $T_c = T_{c,o}$.\nFor parallel flow, $dT_h/da < 0$ and $dT_c/da > 0$. The sign of $dT_{sf,h}/da = -U(T_h-T_c)[\\frac{1-\\alpha}{C_h} - \\frac{\\alpha}{C_c}]$ depends on the term in the brackets.\nThe condition for $dT_{sf,h}/da > 0$ is $\\frac{1-\\alpha}{C_h} < \\frac{\\alpha}{C_c}$, or $\\frac{C_c}{C_h} < \\frac{\\alpha}{1-\\alpha}$.\nUsing the given values: $C_c/C_h \\approx 1.425$. And $\\alpha/(1-\\alpha) \\approx 0.714/(1-0.714) \\approx 2.5$.\nSince $1.425 < 2.5$, the condition is met. $dT_{sf,h}/da > 0$, so the maximum hot-side surface temperature occurs at the fluid outlet ($a=A$).\n\nComparison for Statement B:\nFor a given maximum surface temperature $T_{sf,h,max}$, the limiting heat duty $q$ is determined.\nIn counterflow, the limit is at the hot inlet: $T_{sf,h,max} = T_{sf,h}(0) = T_{h,i}(1-\\alpha) + T_{c,o,CF}\\alpha$. A higher $q$ means a higher $T_{c,o,CF}$, so the constraint is limiting.\nIn parallel flow, the limit is at the outlet: $T_{sf,h,max} = T_{sf,h}(A) = T_{h,o,P}(1-\\alpha) + T_{c,o,P}\\alpha$.\nIn counterflow, the constraint point involves the maximum hot fluid temperature $T_{h,i}$. In parallel flow, the constraint point involves the already cooled hot fluid at $T_{h,o,P}$. Intuitively, this allows for a greater overall temperature drop (higher $q$) in parallel flow before the constraint is violated. A detailed derivation confirms that for the same $T_{sf,h,max}$, the permissible heat duty for parallel flow ($q_P$) is greater than for counterflow ($q_{CF}$).\n**Verdict for B: Correct.**\n\nAnalysis for Case C (Statement C): $U = U_C \\approx 285.7\\ \\mathrm{W\\, m^{-2}\\, K^{-1}}$. Let $\\beta = U_C/h_c \\approx 285.7/2000 \\approx 0.143$.\nFor counterflow, $dT_h/da < 0$ and $dT_c/da < 0$. The derivative $dT_{sf,c}/da = (1-\\beta)dT_c/da + \\beta dT_h/da$ is unambiguously negative. Thus, the maximum cold-side surface temperature occurs at the hot fluid inlet ($a=0$).\nFor parallel flow, $dT_h/da < 0$ and $dT_c/da > 0$. The sign of $dT_{sf,c}/da = U(T_h-T_c)[\\frac{1-\\beta}{C_c} - \\frac{\\beta}{C_h}]$ depends on the bracketed term.\nThe condition for $dT_{sf,c}/da > 0$ is $\\frac{1-\\beta}{C_c} > \\frac{\\beta}{C_h}$, or $\\frac{C_c}{C_h} < \\frac{1-\\beta}{\\beta}$.\nUsing the given values: $C_c/C_h \\approx 1.425$. And $(1-\\beta)/\\beta \\approx (1-0.143)/0.143 \\approx 5.99$.\nSince $1.425 < 5.99$, the condition is met. The maximum cold-side surface temperature occurs at the fluid outlet ($a=A$).\n\nComparison for Statement C:\nThe logic is identical to that for Statement B. In counterflow, the surface temperature constraint is most severe at the hot fluid inlet, where $T_h = T_{h,i}$. In parallel flow, the constraint occurs at the fluid outlet. The fact that the maximum surface temperature in parallel flow does not occur at the point where the hot fluid is at its highest temperature ($T_{h,i}$) provides more operational flexibility. This allows parallel flow to achieve a higher heat duty before the surface temperature limit is reached.\n**Verdict for C: Correct.**\n\nIn summary, statements A, B, and C are correct, while D is incorrect.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{ABC}$$", "id": "2479109"}, {"introduction": "Effective engineering extends beyond initial design to encompass the entire operational life of a system.

Over a finite horizon of $T$ time periods, you must decide in which periods to perform chemical cleaning so as to minimize the sum of the energy penalty (due to reduced thermal conductance as fouling accumulates) and the cleaning costs.\n\nBase the formulation on the following well-tested definitions and laws:\n- The steady heat duty relation $\\dot{Q} = U A \\, F \\, \\Delta T_{\\mathrm{lm}}$, where $\\dot{Q}$ is the heat duty, $U$ is the overall heat transfer coefficient, $A$ is the heat transfer area, $F$ is the temperature correction factor for configuration and flow arrangement, and $\\Delta T_{\\mathrm{lm}}$ is the log-mean temperature difference (LMTD).\n- The resistance-in-series model of overall heat transfer coefficient for a fouling exchanger, $U(t) = \\dfrac{1}{R_{\\mathrm{clean}} + R_f(t)}$, where $R_{\\mathrm{clean}}$ is the clean-side lumped resistance per unit area and $R_f(t)$ is the fouling thermal resistance per unit area. Assume $A$ is constant and known.\n\nAssume the following discrete-time process and decision structure:\n- Time is indexed by $k \\in \\{1,2,\\dots,T\\}$ with uniform time step $\\Delta t$.\n- Define the discrete age state $a_k \\in \\{0,1,\\dots,T\\}$ as the number of time steps since the last cleaning at the start of period $k$. The fouling resistance evolves as $R_f(k) = a_k \\, \\Delta R$, where $\\Delta R > 0$ is the fouling growth per time step.\n- The conductance in period $k$ as a function of age is $UA_k(a_k) = \\dfrac{A}{R_{\\mathrm{clean}} + a_k \\, \\Delta R}$.\n- Let the required conductance threshold be $UA_{\\min} = \\dfrac{\\dot{Q}}{F \\, \\Delta T_{\\mathrm{target}}}$, where $\\Delta T_{\\mathrm{target}}$ is a specified target log-mean temperature difference. When $UA_k(a_k) < UA_{\\min}$, an energy penalty is incurred to maintain performance with utilities. Model the energy penalty rate as $c_e$ dollars per $(\\mathrm{W/K})$ per period, so that the period-$k$ penalty is $p_k(a_k) = c_e \\, \\max\\{0, UA_{\\min} - UA_k(a_k)\\}$.\n- The decision in each period is binary: to clean at the beginning of the period ($x_k = 1$) or not ($x_k = 0$). Cleaning costs $C_c$ dollars, is instantaneous at the start of period $k$, and resets the age to $a_k = 0$ for that period. The state transition is $a_{k+1} = 1$ if $x_k = 1$, and $a_{k+1} = \\min\\{a_k + 1, T\\}$ if $x_k = 0$. The period-$k$ penalty is evaluated with the post-decision age for that period: if $x_k = 1$, use $a_k = 0$ in $UA_k$; if $x_k = 0$, use $a_k$ as given.\n\nYour task:\n1) Formulate the optimization problem to minimize the total cost\n$$\nJ = \\sum_{k=1}^{T} \\big( p_k(a_k^{\\mathrm{use}}) + C_c \\, x_k \\big),\n$$\nwhere $a_k^{\\mathrm{use}}$ is the age used to evaluate $p_k$ in period $k$ (that is, $a_k^{\\mathrm{use}} = 0$ if $x_k = 1$, and $a_k^{\\mathrm{use}} = a_k$ if $x_k = 0$), subject to the stated dynamics and $a_1 = 0$.\n2) Implement a dynamic programming algorithm that computes the optimal cleaning schedule $\\{x_k\\}_{k=1}^{T}$ and the corresponding minimal total cost for each of the test cases below.\n\nPhysical units and output requirements:\n- Use $U_c$ in $\\mathrm{W}/(\\mathrm{m}^2\\cdot\\mathrm{K})$, $A$ in $\\mathrm{m}^2$, $R_{\\mathrm{clean}} = 1/U_c$ in $\\mathrm{m}^2\\cdot\\mathrm{K}/\\mathrm{W}$, $\\Delta R$ in $\\mathrm{m}^2\\cdot\\mathrm{K}/\\mathrm{W}$ per period, $\\dot{Q}$ in $\\mathrm{W}$, and $UA$ in $\\mathrm{W}/\\mathrm{K}$. The penalty rate $c_e$ is in dollars per $(\\mathrm{W}/\\mathrm{K})$ per period, and $C_c$ is in dollars per cleaning. Express the final total cost in dollars rounded to two decimals.

Your program should produce a single line of output containing the results as a comma-separated list enclosed in square brackets, where each element is itself a list of the form $[\\text{total\\_cost}, \\text{n\\_clean}, t_1, t_2, \\dots]$, with $\\text{total\\_cost}$ in dollars rounded to two decimals and $t_i$ integers. For example: $[[1234.50,2,4,8],[0.00,0]]$.", "solution": "The given problem is a well-posed, finite-horizon, discrete-time optimal control problem. It is scientifically grounded in established principles of heat transfer and process engineering. The objective is to determine a control policy—a schedule of cleaning actions—that minimizes a total cost function comprising energy penalties and cleaning expenditures over a time horizon of $T$ periods. The problem structure is a classic application of dynamic programming.\n\nThe problem is formalized as follows.\n\nLet the state of the system at the beginning of each time period $k \\in \\{1, 2, \\dots, T\\}$ be the age of the heat exchanger, denoted by $a_k$. The age is defined as the number of time periods elapsed since the last cleaning. The state space for period $k$ is $a_k \\in \\{0, 1, \\dots, k-1\\}$, with the initial condition given as $a_1 = 0$.\n\nThe decision variable at each period $k$ is binary, $x_k \\in \\{0, 1\\}$, where $x_k = 1$ signifies a decision to clean the exchanger at the beginning of period $k$, and $x_k = 0$ signifies a decision not to clean.\n\nThe cost incurred in period $k$ is a function of the state $a_k$ and the decision $x_k$. Let $a_k^{\\mathrm{use}}$ be the effective age for period $k$ after the decision $x_k$ is made. If no cleaning occurs ($x_k = 0$), the age for the period is unchanged, $a_k^{\\mathrm{use}} = a_k$. If cleaning occurs ($x_k = 1$), the age is reset to zero, $a_k^{\\mathrm{use}} = 0$. The overall thermal conductance in period $k$ is a function of this effective age:\n$$\nUA_k(a_k^{\\mathrm{use}}) = \\frac{A}{R_{\\mathrm{clean}} + a_k^{\\mathrm{use}} \\cdot \\Delta R}\n$$\nwhere $A$ is the heat transfer area, $R_{\\mathrm{clean}}$ is the clean-side thermal resistance per unit area, and $\\Delta R$ is the fouling resistance growth per time step.\n\nAn energy penalty is incurred if the conductance falls below a required threshold, $UA_{\\min}$. The penalty in period $k$, $p_k$, is given by:\n$$\np_k(a_k^{\\mathrm{use}}) = c_e \\cdot \\max\\{0, UA_{\\min} - UA_k(a_k^{\\mathrm{use}})\\}\n$$\nwhere $c_e$ is the energy penalty rate. The total cost contribution in period $k$ is the sum of the cleaning cost and the energy penalty:\n$$\nC_k(a_k, x_k) = C_c \\cdot x_k + p_k(a_k^{\\mathrm{use}})\n$$\nwhere $C_c$ is the cost of a single cleaning action. Note that $a_k^{\\mathrm{use}}$ is itself a function of $a_k$ and $x_k$, specifically $a_k^{\\mathrm{use}} = a_k(1-x_k)$.\n\nThe state transitions are governed by the decision $x_k$. If a cleaning is performed at period $k$ ($x_k=1$), the age at the start of the next period, $a_{k+1}$, is $1$. If no cleaning is performed ($x_k=0$), the age increments by one, so $a_{k+1} = a_k + 1$. These can be combined into a single equation:\n$$\na_{k+1} = (a_k + 1)(1-x_k) + 1 \\cdot x_k\n$$\n\nThe objective is to find a sequence of decisions $\\{x_1^*, x_2^*, \\dots, x_T^*\\}$ that minimizes the total cost over the horizon:\n$$\nJ = \\sum_{k=1}^{T} C_k(a_k, x_k) = \\sum_{k=1}^{T} \\left( C_c \\cdot x_k + p_k(a_k(1-x_k)) \\right)\n$$\nsubject to the state transition dynamics and the initial condition $a_1=0$.\n\nThis problem satisfies the principle of optimality and is solved using backward dynamic programming. Let $J_k(a_k)$ be the optimal cost-to-go from the beginning of period $k$ to the end of the horizon $T$, given that the state is $a_k$. We establish a recursive relationship for $J_k(a_k)$.\n\nThe Bellman equation for this problem is:\n$$\nJ_k(a_k) = \\min_{x_k \\in \\{0, 1\\}} \\left\\{ C_k(a_k, x_k) + J_{k+1}(a_{k+1}) \\right\\}\n$$\nfor $k = T, T-1, \\dots, 1$.\n\nExpanding this for the two possible decisions:\n1.  Decision $x_k = 0$ (Do not clean): The cost is $p_k(a_k)$ and the next state is $a_{k+1} = a_k + 1$. The total future cost is $p_k(a_k) + J_{k+1}(a_k+1)$.\n2.  Decision $x_k = 1$ (Clean): The cost is $C_c + p_k(0)$ and the next state is $a_{k+1} = 1$. The total future cost is $C_c + p_k(0) + J_{k+1}(1)$.\n\nThus, the Bellman equation takes the concrete form:\n$$\nJ_k(a_k) = \\min \\begin{cases} p_k(a_k) + J_{k+1}(a_k+1) & (\\text{if } x_k = 0) \\\\ C_c + p_k(0) + J_{k+1}(1) & (\\text{if } x_k = 1) \\end{cases}\n$$\nThe boundary condition is defined at the end of the horizon. The cost beyond period $T$ is zero, so $J_{T+1}(a) = 0$ for any state $a$.\nThis leads to the terminal cost calculation at $k=T$:\n$$\nJ_T(a_T) = \\min \\{ p_T(a_T), C_c + p_T(0) \\}\n$$\nThe algorithm is implemented in the following Python code, which can be executed to solve the four test cases.\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Main function to solve the fouling management problem for all test cases.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    test_cases = [\n        # Case 1 (double-pipe counterflow)\n        {\"T\": 12, \"A\": 50, \"Uc\": 1000, \"delta_R\": 1e-5, \"Q_dot\": 8.0e5, \n         \"delta_T_target\": 20, \"F\": 1.0, \"c_e\": 0.5, \"Cc\": 1000},\n        # Case 2 (one-shell-pass, two-tube-pass shell-and-tube)\n        {\"T\": 12, \"A\": 50, \"Uc\": 1000, \"delta_R\": 1e-5, \"Q_dot\": 8.8e5,\n         \"delta_T_target\": 20, \"F\": 0.9, \"c_e\": 0.5, \"Cc\": 2000},\n        # Case 3 (cross-flow, both fluids unmixed)\n        {\"T\": 12, \"A\": 50, \"Uc\": 1000, \"delta_R\": 5e-5, \"Q_dot\": 8.4e5,\n         \"delta_T_target\": 20, \"F\": 0.85, \"c_e\": 2.0, \"Cc\": 1500},\n        # Case 4 (double-pipe parallel flow, infeasible target at clean condition)\n        {\"T\": 12, \"A\": 50, \"Uc\": 1000, \"delta_R\": 1e-5, \"Q_dot\": 1.2e6,\n         \"delta_T_target\": 20, \"F\": 1.0, \"c_e\": 0.01, \"Cc\": 2000},\n    ]\n\n    results_str = []\n    for case_params in test_cases:\n        total_cost, cleaning_schedule = dp_solver(case_params)\n        \n        # Format the output for one case as a string\n        cost_str = f\"{total_cost:.2f}\"\n        n_clean = len(cleaning_schedule)\n        \n        res_list = [cost_str, str(n_clean)]\n        if n_clean > 0:\n            res_list.extend(map(str, cleaning_schedule))\n        \n        inner_str = f\"[{','.join(res_list)}]\"\n        results_str.append(inner_str)\n\n    # This function would typically print the result.
