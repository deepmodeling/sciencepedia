The language is objective and precise. The problem is therefore valid.\n\nStep 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. A solution will be provided.\n\nDerivation and Solution\n\nThe analysis begins with the steady-flow energy balance for an adiabatic heat exchanger. The rate of heat transfer, $q$, lost by the hot stream is equal to the rate of heat gained by the cold stream.\n\nFor the hot stream:\n$q = \\dot{m}_{h} c_{p,h} (T_{h,\\mathrm{in}} - T_{h,\\mathrm{out}}) = C_{h} (T_{h,\\mathrm{in}} - T_{h,\\mathrm{out}})$\nFor the cold stream:\n$q = \\dot{m}_{c} c_{p,c} (T_{c,\\mathrm{out}} - T_{c,\\mathrm{in}}) = C_{c} (T_{c,\\mathrm{out}} - T_{c,\\mathrm{in}})$\n\nHere, $C_{h} = \\dot{m}_{h} c_{p,h}$ and $C_{c} = \\dot{m}_{c} c_{p,c}$ are the heat capacity rates of the hot and cold streams, respectively.\n\nThe Second Law of Thermodynamics dictates that heat can only transfer from a region of higher temperature to a region of lower temperature. In a heat exchanger, this means that at any location along the flow path, the temperature of the hot fluid must be greater than or equal to the temperature of the cold fluid. For a counterflow heat exchanger, the limiting temperature conditions occur at the inlets and outlets:\n$T_{h,\\mathrm{in}} \\ge T_{c,\\mathrm{out}}$\n$T_{h,\\mathrm{out}} \\ge T_{c,\\mathrm{in}}$\n\nWe can express the outlet temperatures in terms of the heat transfer rate, $q$:\n$T_{h,\\mathrm{out}} = T_{h,\\mathrm{in}} - \\frac{q}{C_{h}}$\n$T_{c,\\mathrm{out}} = T_{c,\\mathrm{in}} + \\frac{q}{C_{c}}$\n\nSubstituting these expressions into the Second Law constraints yields two upper bounds for $q$:\n1. From $T_{h,\\mathrm{in}} \\ge T_{c,\\mathrm{out}}$:\n$T_{h,\\mathrm{in}} \\ge T_{c,\\mathrm{in}} + \\frac{q}{C_{c}} \\implies q \\le C_{c} (T_{h,\\mathrm{in}} - T_{c,\\mathrm{in}})$\n2. From $T_{h,\\mathrm{out}} \\ge T_{c,\\mathrm{in}}$:\n$T_{h,\\mathrm{in}} - \\frac{q}{C_{h}} \\ge T_{c,\\mathrm{in}} \\implies q \\le C_{h} (T_{h,\\mathrm{in}} - T_{c,\\mathrm{in}})$\n\nTo satisfy both constraints simultaneously, the heat transfer rate $q$ must not exceed the smaller of these two bounds. Let $C_{\\min} = \\min(C_{h}, C_{c})$. The maximum possible heat transfer rate, $q_{\\max}$, is therefore limited by the fluid with the minimum heat capacity rate and the maximum possible temperature difference across the exchanger, which is $(T_{h,\\mathrm{in}} - T_{c,\\mathrm{in}})$.\nThe general upper bound is:\n$q_{\\max} = C_{\\min} (T_{h,\\mathrm{in}} - T_{c,\\mathrm{in}})$\n\nThis theoretical maximum is attained in the reversible limit, which corresponds to an ideal heat exchanger with an infinitely large surface area. In this limit:\n- If $C_{h} = C_{\\min}$, setting $q = q_{\\max}$ in the energy balance for the hot stream gives $C_{h} (T_{h,\\mathrm{in}} - T_{c,\\mathrm{in}}) = C_{h} (T_{h,\\mathrm{in}} - T_{h,\\mathrm{out}})$, which implies the outlet temperature of the hot stream reaches the inlet temperature of the cold stream: $T_{h,\\mathrm{out}} = T_{c,\\mathrm{in}}$.\n- If $C_{c} = C_{\\min}$, setting $q = q_{\\max}$ in the energy balance for the cold stream gives $C_{c} (T_{h,\\mathrm{in}} - T_{c,\\mathrm{in}}) = C_{c} (T_{c,\\mathrm{out}} - T_{c,\\mathrm{in}})$, which implies the outlet temperature of the cold stream reaches the inlet temperature of the hot stream: $T_{c,\\mathrm{out}} = T_{h,\\mathrm{in}}$.\n\nTherefore, the fluid with the minimum heat capacity rate ($C_{\\min}$) is the one that could theoretically undergo the maximum temperature change, with its outlet temperature approaching the inlet temperature of the other fluid.\n\nNow, we compute the required quantities using the given data.\n\n1) and 2) Heat Capacity Rates ($C_{\\min}$ and $C_{\\max}$):\nFirst, calculate $C_{h}$ and $C_{c}$. The specific heats are given in $\\mathrm{kJ/(kg\\cdot K)}$, so the heat capacity rates will be in $\\mathrm{kW/K}$.\n$C_{h} = \\dot{m}_{h} c_{p,h} = (0.9200\\ \\mathrm{kg/s})(3.850\\ \\mathrm{kJ/(kg\\cdot K)}) = 3.542\\ \\mathrm{kW/K}$\n$C_{c} = \\dot{m}_{c} c_{p,c} = (1.350\\ \\mathrm{kg/s})(4.120\\ \\mathrm{kJ/(kg\\cdot K)}) = 5.562\\ \\mathrm{kW/K}$\n\nComparing these values:\n$C_{h} = 3.542\\ \\mathrm{kW/K}$\n$C_{c} = 5.562\\ \\mathrm{kW/K}$\nThus, the minimum and maximum heat capacity rates are:\n$C_{\\min} = C_{h} = 3.542\\ \\mathrm{kW/K}$\n$C_{\\max} = C_{c} = 5.562\\ \\mathrm{kW/K}$\n\n3) Maximum Possible Heat Transfer Rate ($q_{\\max}$):\n$q_{\\max}$ is calculated using $C_{\\min}$ and the overall temperature difference.\n$q_{\\max} = C_{\\min} (T_{h,\\mathrm{in}} - T_{c,\\mathrm{in}})$\n$q_{\\max} = (3.542\\ \\mathrm{kW/K}) (430.0\\ \\mathrm{K} - 310.0\\ \\mathrm{K})$\n$q_{\\max} = (3.542\\ \\mathrm{kW/K}) (120.0\\ \\mathrm{K}) = 425.04\\ \\mathrm{kW}$\nRounding to four significant figures, $q_{\\max} = 425.0\\ \\mathrm{kW}$.\n\n4) Reversible-Limit Outlet Temperature of the $C_{\\min}$ Stream:\nThe stream with $C_{\\min}$ is the hot stream ($C_h$).

It is a standard derivation problem in the field of heat transfer, requiring application of fundamental principles. We will proceed with the derivation as requested.\n\nThe analysis begins with the principle of conservation of energy applied to a differential area element $dA$ within the heat exchanger. For a two-stream heat exchanger operating at steady state, the rate of heat transfer $dQ$ across this element is given by the rate equation:\n$$dQ = U (T_h - T_c) dA$$\nwhere $U$ is the overall heat transfer coefficient, and $T_h$ and $T_c$ are the local temperatures of the hot and cold fluids, respectively.\n\nEnergy balances on the two fluid streams as they pass over the area $dA$ yield:\n$$dQ = -C_h dT_h$$\n$$dQ = \\sigma C_c dT_c$$\nHere, $C_h$ and $C_c$ are the heat capacity rates of the hot and cold fluids, defined as $C = \\dot{m} c_p$. The term $dT_h$ represents the infinitesimal change in the hot fluid temperature, which is negative as heat is transferred from it. The term $dT_c$ is the change in the cold fluid temperature.

We apply L'Hôpital's rule. For clarity, let's substitute $x = 1 - C_r$, so that as $C_r \\to 1$, $x \\to 0$. The expression becomes:\n$$\\epsilon_{\\mathrm{counter}} = \\frac{1 - \\exp(-\\mathrm{NTU} \\cdot x)}{1 - (1-x) \\exp(-\\mathrm{NTU} \\cdot x)}$$\nWe differentiate the numerator $N(x)$ and denominator $D(x)$ with respect to $x$:\n$$N'(x) = \\frac{d}{dx}\\left(1 - e^{-\\mathrm{NTU}x}\\right) = \\mathrm{NTU}e^{-\\mathrm{NTU}x}$$\n$$D'(x) = \\frac{d}{dx}\\left(1 - (1-x)e^{-\\mathrm{NTU}x}\\right) = -\\left[(-1)e^{-\\mathrm{NTU}x} + (1-x)(-\\mathrm{NTU})e^{-\\mathrm{NTU}x}\\right] = e^{-\\mathrm{NTU}x} + (1-x)\\mathrm{NTU}e^{-\\mathrm{NTU}x}$$\nNow we take the limit of the ratio of the derivatives as $x \\to 0$:\n$$\\lim_{x \\to 0} \\frac{N'(x)}{D'(x)} = \\frac{\\mathrm{NTU}e^0}{e^0 + (1-0)\\mathrm{NTU}e^0} = \\frac{\\mathrm{NTU}}{1 + \\mathrm{NTU}}$$\nThus, the limiting expression is:\n$$\\epsilon_{\\mathrm{counter}}(\\mathrm{NTU}; C_r \\to 1) = \\frac{\\mathrm{NTU}}{1+\\mathrm{NTU}}$$\n\nPhysical interpretation: When $C_r=1$, the heat capacity rates are balanced ($C_h=C_c$).\nIn parallel flow, the temperature difference $\\Delta T = T_h - T_c$ decreases exponentially along the exchanger. As $\\mathrm{NTU} \\to \\infty$, both fluid outlet temperatures approach the arithmetic mean of the inlet temperatures, $T_{out} \\to (T_{h,in}+T_{c,in})/2$. The maximum possible temperature change for either fluid is $(T_{h,in}-T_{c,in})/2$. Thus, the maximum effectiveness is $\\epsilon_{max} = \\frac{C(T_{in}-T_{out})}{C(T_{h,in}-T_{c,in})} = \\frac{T_{in} - (T_{h,in}+T_{c,in})/2}{T_{h,in}-T_{c,in}} = \\frac{(T_{h,in}-T_{c,in})/2}{T_{h,in}-T_{c,in}} = 1/2$. This heat exchange \"penalty\" arises because the driving temperature difference diminishes rapidly.\nIn counterflow with $C_r=1$, the temperature difference $T_h(x)-T_c(x)$ is constant throughout the exchanger. This allows for a much more efficient thermal energy transfer.

[@problem_id:2528694]", "problem": "A single-shell-pass, four-tube-pass heat exchanger is used to heat a cold liquid with a hot condensing vapor on the shell side.

Report the common value.\n\nStep 2: Validation\nThe problem is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. It describes a standard engineering scenario (heating a fluid with a condensing vapor) using established principles and terminology of heat transfer theory (effectiveness-NTU method). All necessary data are provided, and the parameters are physically realistic. The problem is self-contained and free of contradictions or ambiguities. It asks for a standard calculation followed by a validation from a more fundamental derivation, which is a rigorous and meaningful exercise.\n\nStep 3: Verdict\nThe problem is valid. A solution will be provided.\n\nThe analysis proceeds by determining the governing dimensionless parameters of the effectiveness-NTU method. The heat capacity rates are given as $C_{c} = 1.2 \\times 10^{3}\\ \\mathrm{W/K}$ and $C_{h} \\to \\infty$.\nThe minimum and maximum heat capacity rates are therefore:\n$C_{\\min} = C_{c} = 1.2 \\times 10^{3}\\ \\mathrm{W/K}$\n$C_{\\max} = C_{h} \\to \\infty$\n\nThe capacity rate ratio, $C_{r}$, is defined as the ratio of the minimum to the maximum heat capacity rate:\n$$C_{r} = \\frac{C_{\\min}}{C_{\\max}} = \\frac{C_{c}}{C_{h}} \\to 0$$\nA capacity rate ratio of $C_{r}=0$ corresponds to a situation where one of the fluids undergoes a phase change at constant temperature, as is the case here with the condensing vapor.\n\nThe Number of Transfer Units, $NTU$, is defined as:\n$$NTU = \\frac{UA}{C_{\\min}}$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$NTU = \\frac{1.8 \\times 10^{3}\\ \\mathrm{W/K}}{1.2 \\times 10^{3}\\ \\mathrm{W/K}} = 1.5$$\n\nPart 1: Calculation using Standard Relations\nFor any heat exchanger configuration where one fluid maintains a constant temperature ($C_{r}=0$), the effectiveness, $\\epsilon$, is independent of the flow geometry (e.g., parallel-flow, counter-flow, cross-flow, or shell-and-tube). This can be shown by considering the governing differential equation for heat transfer.\nLet $dA$ be a differential area element. The heat transfer across this element is $dq = U(T_{h} - T_{c})dA$. This must equal the change in enthalpy of the cold fluid, $dq = C_{c} dT_{c}$.\nEquating these gives:\n$$C_{c} dT_{c} = U(T_{h} - T_{c})dA$$\nSeparating variables and integrating over the entire heat exchanger area $A$, along the path of the cold fluid from inlet to outlet:\n$$\\int_{T_{c,\\mathrm{in}}}^{T_{c,\\mathrm{out}}} \\frac{dT_{c}}{T_{h} - T_{c}} = \\int_{0}^{A} \\frac{U}{C_{c}} dA$$\nThe integration yields:\n$$-\\ln(T_{h} - T_{c})\\Big|_{T_{c,\\mathrm{in}}}^{T_{c,\\mathrm{out}}} = \\frac{UA}{C_{c}}$$\n$$\\ln\\left(\\frac{T_{h} - T_{c,\\mathrm{in}}}{T_{h} - T_{c,\\mathrm{out}}}\\right) = \\frac{UA}{C_{c}} = NTU$$\nExponentiating both sides gives:\n$$\\frac{T_{h} - T_{c,\\mathrm{out}}}{T_{h} - T_{c,\\mathrm{in}}} = \\exp(-NTU)$$\nThe effectiveness, $\\epsilon$, is defined for the fluid with the minimum heat capacity rate, which is the cold fluid in this case:\n$$\\epsilon = \\frac{q}{q_{\\max}} = \\frac{C_{c}(T_{c,\\mathrm{out}} - T_{c,\\mathrm{in}})}{C_{\\min}(T_{h,\\mathrm{in}} - T_{c,\\mathrm{in}})}$$\nSince $C_{\\min} = C_{c}$ and the hot fluid temperature is constant at $T_{h}$:\n$$\\epsilon = \\frac{T_{c,\\mathrm{out}} - T_{c,\\mathrm{in}}}{T_{h} - T_{c,\\mathrm{in}}} = 1 - \\frac{T_{h} - T_{c,\\mathrm{out}}}{T_{h} - T_{c,\\mathrm{in}}}$$\nSubstituting the result from the integration:\n$$\\epsilon = 1 - \\exp(-NTU)$$\nThis is the standard relation for any heat exchanger operating with $C_r=0$.\n\nPart 2: Validation via Pass-by-Pass Analysis\nThe problem requires validation by considering the four tube passes individually. The total overall conductance-area product is $UA$ and the total number of transfer units is $NTU=1.5$. We assume the heat transfer area is distributed equally among the $N_{p}=4$ passes.\nThe NTU for a single pass, $NTU_{p}$, is:\n$$NTU_{p} = \\frac{UA/N_{p}}{C_{c}} = \\frac{NTU}{N_{p}} = \\frac{1.5}{4} = 0.375$$\nFor each pass, the cold fluid exchanges heat with the shell-side fluid at constant temperature $T_{h}$. The governing relation for a single pass $i$ is derived identically to the overall case, relating the pass outlet temperature $T'_{c,i}$ to the pass inlet temperature $T_{c,i}$:\n$$\\frac{T_{h} - T'_{c,i}}{T_{h} - T_{c,i}} = \\exp(-NTU_{p})$$\nWe apply this relation sequentially for each of the four passes.\nPass 1: $T_{c,1} = T_{c,\\mathrm{in}}$. The outlet temperature $T'_{c,1}$ is given by $\\frac{T_{h} - T'_{c,1}}{T_{h} - T_{c,\\mathrm{in}}} = \\exp(-NTU_{p})$.\nPass 2: The inlet is the outlet of Pass 1, so $T_{c,2} = T'_{c,1}$. The outlet temperature $T'_{c,2}$ is given by $\\frac{T_{h} - T'_{c,2}}{T_{h} - T'_{c,1}} = \\exp(-NTU_{p})$.\nCombining with the result from Pass 1:\n$$T_{h} - T'_{c,2} = (T_{h} - T'_{c,1})\\exp(-NTU_{p}) = (T_{h} - T_{c,\\mathrm{in}})\\exp(-NTU_{p})\\exp(-NTU_{p}) = (T_{h} - T_{c,\\mathrm{in}})\\exp(-2 NTU_{p})$$\nThis process is a recursive relation. After $N_p=4$ passes, the final outlet temperature of the cold fluid, $T_{c,\\mathrm{out}} = T'_{c,4}$, is related to the initial inlet temperature $T_{c,\\mathrm{in}}$ by:\n$$T_{h} - T_{c,\\mathrm{out}} = (T_{h} - T_{c,\\mathrm{in}}) \\exp(-N_{p} \\cdot NTU_{p})$$\nThe product $N_{p} \\cdot NTU_{p}$ is simply the total NTU for the entire heat exchanger:\n$$N_{p} \\cdot NTU_{p} = 4 \\times \\left(\\frac{NTU}{4}\\right) = NTU$$\nThus, the pass-by-pass analysis yields:\n$$\\frac{T_{h} - T_{c,\\mathrm{out}}}{T_{h} - T_{c,\\mathrm{in}}} = \\exp(-NTU)$$\nThis result is identical to the one obtained from the standard relation. The definition of effectiveness $\\epsilon$ then leads to the same expression:\n$$\\epsilon = 1 - \\frac{T_{h} - T_{c,\\mathrm{out}}}{T_{h} - T_{c,\\mathrm{in}}} = 1 - \\exp(-NTU)$$\nThe validation is successful; both methods give the identical analytical result, confirming that the multi-pass geometry does not alter the effectiveness calculation when $C_r=0$.\n\nFinal Calculation\nWith $NTU = 1.5$, the effectiveness $\\epsilon$ is:\n$$\\epsilon = 1 - \\exp(-1.5)$$\n$$\\epsilon \\approx 1 - 0.22313016... = 0.7768698...$$\nRounding to four significant figures as requested:\n$$\\epsilon \\approx 0.7769$$\nThis is the common value of effectiveness determined by both methods.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.7769}$$", "id": "2528694"}]}
