All data and definitions required for a unique solution are provided. The numerical values are physically consistent with a turbulent gas flow in a tube. The apparent inconsistency between the provided friction factor and the mass-transfer factor is a point to be analyzed as part of the problem, not a flaw in the problem statement itself.\n\nThe solution proceeds in three parts as requested.\n\nFirst, an expression relating the Sherwood number ($Sh$) to the Chilton–Colburn factor ($j_D$), Reynolds number ($Re$), and Schmidt number ($Sc$) is derived, followed by the computation of the numerical value of $Sh$.\n\nThe standard definitions required are:\nSherwood number:\n$$Sh = \\frac{k_c d}{D_{AB}}$$\nReynolds number:\n$$Re = \\frac{\\rho u_b d}{\\mu}$$\nSchmidt number:\n$$Sc = \\frac{\\mu}{\\rho D_{AB}}$$\nMass-transfer Stanton number:\n$$St_m = \\frac{k_c}{u_b}$$\nChilton–Colburn mass-transfer factor:\n$$j_D = St_m Sc^{2/3}$$\n\nTo derive the relationship, we begin with the definition of $j_D$ and substitute the definition of $St_m$:\n$$j_D = \\left(\\frac{k_c}{u_b}\\right) Sc^{2/3}$$\nWe can express the mass transfer coefficient, $k_c$, from the definition of the Sherwood number as $k_c = \\frac{Sh D_{AB}}{d}$. Substituting this into the equation for $j_D$:\n$$j_D = \\left(\\frac{Sh D_{AB}}{d u_b}\\right) Sc^{2/3}$$\nTo express this relationship in terms of dimensionless numbers only, we must replace the dimensional group $\\frac{d u_b}{D_{AB}}$. We can achieve this by multiplying the Reynolds number by the Schmidt number:\n$$Re \\cdot Sc = \\left(\\frac{\\rho u_b d}{\\mu}\\right) \\left(\\frac{\\mu}{\\rho D_{AB}}\\right) = \\frac{u_b d}{D_{AB}}$$\nSubstituting this product into the rearranged equation for $j_D$:\n$$\\frac{j_D}{Sc^{2/3}} = Sh \\left(\\frac{D_{AB}}{u_b d}\\right) = \\frac{Sh}{Re \\cdot Sc}$$\nSolving for $Sh$ yields the desired expression:\n$$Sh = j_D \\cdot Re \\cdot Sc \\cdot Sc^{-2/3} = j_D Re Sc^{1/3}$$\nNow, we compute the numerical values of the dimensionless numbers from the given data:\n$d = 0.020\\ \\mathrm{m}$, $u_b = 15.0\\ \\mathrm{m/s}$, $\\rho = 1.20\\ \\mathrm{kg/m^3}$, $\\mu = 1.80 \\times 10^{-5}\\ \\mathrm{kg/(m\\ s)}$, $D_{AB} = 1.20 \\times 10^{-5}\\ \\mathrm{m^2/s}$, and $j_D = 0.01300$.\n\n$$Re = \\frac{(1.20\\ \\mathrm{kg/m^3})(15.0\\ \\mathrm{m/s})(0.020\\ \\mathrm{m})}{1.80 \\times 10^{-5}\\ \\mathrm{kg/(m\\ s)}} = \\frac{0.36}{1.80 \\times 10^{-5}} = 20000$$\n$$Sc = \\frac{1.80 \\times 10^{-5}\\ \\mathrm{kg/(m\\ s)}}{(1.20\\ \\mathrm{kg/m^3})(1.20 \\times 10^{-5}\\ \\mathrm{m^2/s)}} = \\frac{1.80}{1.44} = 1.25$$\nUsing these values, we compute the Sherwood number:\n$$Sh = (0.01300)(20000)(1.25)^{1/3} \\approx (260)(1.077217) \\approx 280.0764$$\nRounding to four significant figures, $Sh = 280.1$.\n\nSecond, we compute the mass transfer coefficient $k_c$. From the definition of the Sherwood number:\n$$k_c = \\frac{Sh D_{AB}}{d}$$\nUsing the unrounded value of $Sh$ for accuracy:\n$$k_c = \\frac{(280.0764)(1.20 \\times 10^{-5}\\ \\mathrm{m^2/s})}{0.020\\ \\mathrm{m}} \\approx 0.168046\\ \\mathrm{m/s}$$\nRounding to four significant figures, $k_c = 0.1680\\ \\mathrm{m/s}$.\n\nThird, we assess the local sensitivity and the consistency with the Chilton-Colburn analogy.\nThe sensitivity of a variable $Y$ to a parameter $X$ can be quantified by the logarithmic sensitivity exponent, $S_X^Y = \\frac{\\partial(\\ln Y)}{\\partial(\\ln X)}$, which for a power-law relation $Y \\propto X^n$ is simply the exponent $n$.\n\nThe relationship for $Sh$ is $Sh = j_D Re Sc^{1/3}$. At fixed $j_D$ and $Re$, the dependence on $Sc$ is $Sh \\propto Sc^{1/3}$. The logarithmic sensitivity exponent is therefore:\n$$S_{Sc}^{Sh} = \\frac{1}{3}$$\nThis indicates a weak, positive dependence: a $1\\%$ increase in $Sc$ results in approximately a $0.33\\%$ increase in $Sh$.\n\nFor the mass transfer coefficient $k_c$, we can use the relation derived from the mass-transfer Stanton number: $k_c = u_b St_m = u_b \\frac{j_D}{Sc^{2/3}}$. With $u_b$ and $j_D$ fixed, the dependence is $k_c \\propto Sc^{-2/3}$. The logarithmic sensitivity exponent is:\n$$S_{Sc}^{k_c} = -\\frac{2}{3}$$\nThis indicates a moderate, negative dependence: a $1\\%$ increase in $Sc$ results in approximately a $0.67\\%$ decrease in $k_c$. A higher Schmidt number implies that mass diffusivity is smaller relative to momentum diffusivity, which leads to a thinner concentration boundary layer and a lower mass transfer coefficient for given flow conditions.\n\nFinally, we assess the consistency of the measured $j_D = 0.01300$ and the Darcy friction factor $f = 0.0265$. The Chilton-Colburn analogy relates the mass transfer factor to the friction factor. For turbulent flow in pipes, the analogy is commonly stated as $j_D = f_{Darcy}/8$.\nUsing the given Darcy friction factor, the analogy predicts:\n$$j_{D, \\text{analogy}} = \\frac{f}{8} = \\frac{0.0265}{8} = 0.0033125$$\nThe measured value is $j_{D, \\text{measured}} = 0.01300$. There is a significant discrepancy, with the measured value being approximately $3.9$ times larger than the value predicted by the analogy.\n$$\\frac{j_{D, \\text{measured}}}{j_{D, \\text{analogy}}} = \\frac{0.01300}{0.0033125} \\approx 3.92$$\nSuch a large deviation is unusual, given that $Sc = 1.25$ is close to unity, where the analogy is expected to be most accurate. However, there is a common ambiguity in the definition of the friction factor. If the provided value $f=0.0265$ were intended to be the Fanning friction factor ($f_{Fanning}$), the relevant analogy would be $j_D = f_{Fanning}/2$. This would predict:\n$$j_{D, \\text{analogy}} = \\frac{f_{Fanning}}{2} = \\frac{0.0265}{2} = 0.01325$$\nThis value is in excellent agreement with the measured $j_D = 0.01300$, with a difference of only about $2\\%$. It is highly probable that the term \"Darcy friction factor\" was used imprecisely in the problem statement, and the Fanning friction factor was intended.

The problem is valid. We proceed to the solution.\n\nFirst, we derive the series-resistance relation for the overall mass transfer coefficient $K$. The wall flux $N_w$ is expressed in three ways:\n$1.$ $N_{w} = K(C_{b}-C_{e})$\n$2.$ $N_{w} = k_{f}(C_{b}-C_{w})$\n$3.$ $N_{w} = k_{w}(C_{w}-C_{e})$\n\nFrom equations ($2$) and ($3$), we isolate the concentration differences:\nFrom ($2$): $C_{b}-C_{w} = \\frac{N_{w}}{k_{f}}$\nFrom ($3$): $C_{w}-C_{e} = \\frac{N_{w}}{k_{w}}$\n\nSumming these two expressions eliminates the intermediate wall concentration $C_w$:\n$(C_{b}-C_{w}) + (C_{w}-C_{e}) = \\frac{N_{w}}{k_{f}} + \\frac{N_{w}}{k_{w}}$\n$C_{b}-C_{e} = N_{w} \\left( \\frac{1}{k_{f}} + \\frac{1}{k_{w}} \\right)$\n\nWe can write $N_w$ as a function of the overall driving force $C_b-C_e$:\n$N_{w} = \\frac{C_{b}-C_{e}}{\\frac{1}{k_{f}} + \\frac{1}{k_{w}}}$\n\nComparing this with the definition of the overall coefficient $K$ from equation ($1$), $N_{w}=K(C_{b}-C_{e})$, we find:\n$K = \\frac{1}{\\frac{1}{k_{f}} + \\frac{1}{k_{w}}}$\n\nThis is equivalent to the series-resistance relation, where the total resistance is the sum of the individual resistances:\n$\\frac{1}{K} = \\frac{1}{k_{f}} + \\frac{1}{k_{w}}$\n\nNext, we convert this relation into a dimensionless form involving $\\mathrm{Sh}$, $\\mathrm{Sh}_{f}$, and $\\mathrm{Bi}_{m}$. We start with the resistance relation and manipulate it to introduce the dimensionless numbers.

We proceed with the solution.\n\nThe problem asks for the derivation of the Sherwood number, $Sh$, for turbulent flow in a pipe with mass addition at the wall. The derivation is based on a simplified model of the near-wall region.\n\nLet $y$ be the coordinate normal to the wall, with $y=0$ at the wall. The mass fraction of species $B$ is denoted by $\\omega_B(y)$. The problem states that transport in the near-wall sublayer of thickness $\\delta_c$ is governed by a one-dimensional steady-state balance between convection and diffusion.

The total mass flux of species $B$ at the wall is from the specified production, $\\dot{m}_{B,w}'' = r_w M_B$. Total mass continuity at the wall gives $\\dot{m}_{B,w}'' = \\rho_w v_w$.

With $\\rho_B = \\rho\\omega_B$, $\\rho \\approx \\rho_w$, and $\\rho_{B,b}=0$, this becomes $j_{B,w} = k_m \\rho_w \\omega_{B,w}$.\nFrom the boundary condition derivation, we have $j_{B,w} = \\rho_w v_w (1-\\omega_{B,w})$.\nEquating the two expressions for $j_{B,w}$:\n$k_m \\rho_w \\omega_{B,w} = \\rho_w v_w (1-\\omega_{B,w}) \\implies k_m = v_w \\frac{1-\\omega_{B,w}}{\\omega_{B,w}}$.\nSubstituting the expression for $\\omega_{B,w}$:\n$$k_m = v_w \\frac{\\exp\\left(-\\frac{v_w \\delta_c}{D}\\right)}{1 - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{v_w \\delta_c}{D}\\right)} = \\frac{v_w}{\\exp\\left(\\frac{v_w \\delta_c}{D}\\right) - 1}$$\nThe Sherwood number is $Sh = \\frac{k_m (2R)}{D}$, where the characteristic length is the pipe diameter $2R$.\n$$Sh = \\frac{v_w (2R)}{D} \\frac{1}{\\exp\\left(\\frac{v_w \\delta_c}{D}\\right) - 1}$$\nNow, we relate this to the no-blowing case, $Sh_0$. For $v_w \\to 0$, the mass transfer coefficient is $k_{m,0}$. Using the limit $\\exp(x)-1 \\approx x$ for small $x$:\n$$k_{m,0} = \\lim_{v_w\\to 0} \\frac{v_w}{\\frac{v_w \\delta_c}{D}} = \\frac{D}{\\delta_c}$$\nThe Sherwood number without blowing is $Sh_0 = \\frac{k_{m,0} (2R)}{D} = \\frac{(D/\\delta_c)(2R)}{D} = \\frac{2R}{\\delta_c}$.\nThis allows us to express the sublayer thickness as $\\delta_c = \\frac{2R}{Sh_0}$. The problem assumes $\\delta_c$ is unchanged by blowing.\nSubstituting $\\delta_c$ into the expression for $Sh$:\n$$Sh = \\frac{v_w (2R)}{D} \\frac{1}{\\exp\\left(\\frac{v_w}{D} \\frac{2R}{Sh_0}\\right) - 1}$$\nLet us define the dimensionless blowing parameter $\\phi = \\frac{v_w (2R)}{D Sh_0}$. The term $\\frac{v_w(2R)}{D}$ can be written as $Sh_0 \\phi$.\nThe expression for the Sherwood number becomes:\n$$Sh = Sh_0 \\phi \\frac{1}{e^\\phi - 1} = Sh_0 \\frac{\\phi}{\\exp(\\phi)-1}$$\nThis is the desired expression for $Sh$ relating it to $Sh_0$ and the blowing parameter $\\phi$.\n\nNext, we eliminate $v_w$ by expressing it in terms of the given problem data. Mass conservation at the wall gives $\\rho_w v_w = \\dot{m}''_w$. The mass flux is due to species B production, so $\\dot{m}''_w = r_w M_B$.\n$$v_w = \\frac{r_w M_B}{\\rho_w}$$\nThe wall gas density $\\rho_w$ is given by the ideal gas law for the carrier gas: $\\rho_w = \\frac{p M_c}{R_u T_w}$.\nSubstituting this into the expression for $v_w$:\n$$v_w = \\frac{r_w M_B R_u T_w}{p M_c}$$\nNow, we express the blowing parameter $\\phi$ in terms of the given data:\n$$\\phi = \\frac{v_w (2R)}{D Sh_0} = \\frac{2 R}{D Sh_0} \\left( \\frac{r_w M_B R_u T_w}{p M_c} \\right) = \\frac{2 R r_w M_B R_u T_w}{p D M_c Sh_0}$$\nThe problem is reduced to calculating $\\phi$ from the given values and then finding $Sh$.\n\nNumerical calculation:\nGiven data in SI units:\n$R = 1.00 \\times 10^{-2}\\ \\mathrm{m}$\n$p = 1.013 \\times 10^{5}\\ \\mathrm{Pa}$\n$T_w = 400\\ \\mathrm{K}$\n$M_c = 28.0 \\times 10^{-3}\\ \\mathrm{kg\\ mol^{-1}}$\n$M_B = 34.0 \\times 10^{-3}\\ \\mathrm{kg\\ mol^{-1}}$\n$R_u = 8.31446\\ \\mathrm{J\\ mol^{-1}\\ K^{-1}}$\n$r_w = 1.260\\ \\mathrm{mol\\ m^{-2}\\ s^{-1}}$\n$D = 1.60 \\times 10^{-5}\\ \\mathrm{m^{2}\\ s^{-1}}$\n$Sh_0 = 210.0$\n\nFirst, calculate the blowing velocity $v_w$:\nThe wall gas density is $\\rho_w = \\frac{(1.013 \\times 10^5) \\times (28.0 \\times 10^{-3})}{8.31446 \\times 400} \\approx 0.85285\\ \\mathrm{kg\\ m^{-3}}$.\nThe blowing velocity is $v_w = \\frac{1.260 \\times (34.0 \\times 10^{-3})}{0.85285} \\approx 0.050231\\ \\mathrm{m\\ s^{-1}}$.\n\nNow, calculate the dimensionless blowing parameter $\\phi$:\n$$\\phi = \\frac{v_w (2R)}{D Sh_0} = \\frac{0.050231 \\times (2 \\times 1.00 \\times 10^{-2})}{(1.60 \\times 10^{-5}) \\times 210.0} = \\frac{0.00100462}{0.00336} \\approx 0.29899$$\n\nFinally, calculate the Sherwood number with blowing, $Sh$:\n$$Sh = Sh_0 \\frac{\\phi}{\\exp(\\phi)-1} = 210.0 \\times \\frac{0.29899}{\\exp(0.29899)-1}$$\n$$Sh = 210.0 \\times \\frac{0.29899}{1.34845 - 1} = 210.0 \\times \\frac{0.29899}{0.34845}$$\n$$Sh = 210.0 \\times 0.85805 \\approx 180.19$$\nRounding to four significant figures, the final result is $180.2$.\nThe wall blowing reduces the Sherwood number from $210.0$ to $180.2$, which is a physically expected outcome, as the injected gas provides a buffer layer that hinders mass transfer from the wall to the bulk flow.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{180.2}$$", "id": "2496605"}]}
