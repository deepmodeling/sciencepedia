BC2: $C(x \\to \\infty, t) = C_{0}$ for $t > 0$\n\nThis problem lacks a characteristic length or time scale, which suggests a similarity solution exists. We introduce a single similarity variable $\\eta$ that combines the independent variables $x$ and $t$. Based on dimensional analysis, this variable must be of the form $\\eta \\propto x/\\sqrt{Dt}$. We choose the conventional form:\n$$\n\\eta = \\frac{x}{\\sqrt{4Dt}}\n$$\nTo simplify the boundary conditions, we define a dimensionless concentration, $\\theta(\\eta)$:\n$$\n\\theta(\\eta) = \\frac{C(x,t) - C_{s}}{C_{0} - C_{s}}\n$$\nThe PDE for $C(x,t)$ can now be transformed into an ODE for $\\theta(\\eta)$.

The equation becomes a first-order separable ODE:\n$$\n\\frac{dp}{d\\eta} = -2\\eta p \\implies \\frac{dp}{p} = -2\\eta d\\eta\n$$\nIntegrating gives $\\ln(p) = -\\eta^2 + K_{1}$, or $p = K_{2}\\exp(-\\eta^2)$, where $K_{2} = \\exp(K_{1})$ is a constant.

Thus:\n$$\n1 = K_{2} \\frac{\\sqrt{\\pi}}{2} \\implies K_{2} = \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{\\pi}}\n$$\nThe solution for $\\theta(\\eta)$ is therefore:\n$$\n\\theta(\\eta) = \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{\\pi}} \\int_{0}^{\\eta} \\exp(-z^2) dz \\equiv \\text{erf}(\\eta)\n$$\nwhere $\\text{erf}(\\eta)$ is the error function. The concentration profile $C(x,t)$ is found by transforming back:\n$$\nC(x,t) = C_{s} + (C_{0} - C_{s}) \\text{erf}\\left(\\frac{x}{\\sqrt{4Dt}}\\right)\n$$\nThe diffusive flux at the boundary $x=0$ is what is required. The flux is $J(x,t) = -D \\frac{\\partial C}{\\partial x}$. First, we compute the concentration gradient:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial C}{\\partial x} = (C_{0} - C_{s}) \\frac{d}{dx}\\left[\\text{erf}\\left(\\frac{x}{\\sqrt{4Dt}}\\right)\\right] = (C_{0} - C_{s}) \\left[\\frac{2}{\\sqrt{\\pi}} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{x^2}{4Dt}\\right)\\right] \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{4Dt}}\n$$\nNow, evaluate the flux $J(x,t)$ at the boundary $x=0$:\n$$\nJ(0,t) = -D \\left. \\frac{\\partial C}{\\partial x} \\right|_{x=0} = -D (C_{0} - C_{s}) \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{\\pi}\\sqrt{4Dt}} \\exp(0)\n$$\nSimplifying this expression yields the final result for the diffusive flux at the boundary:\n$$\nJ(0,t) = -D (C_{0} - C_{s}) \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\pi Dt}} = (C_{s} - C_{0}) \\frac{D}{\\sqrt{\\pi Dt}} = (C_{s} - C_{0})\\sqrt{\\frac{D}{\\pi t}}\n$$\nThis result shows that the magnitude of the flux, $|J(0,t)|$, is proportional to $|C_{s}-C_{0}|$ and $\\sqrt{D}$, as expected. The time dependence emerges from the similarity structure of the problem. Specifically, the flux decays with time as $t^{-1/2}$. This decay occurs because as time progresses, the diffusing species penetrates deeper into the medium, causing the concentration gradient at the surface $x=0$ to decrease. Since the flux is directly proportional to this gradient, the flux diminishes over time. The exponent in this temporal decay is precisely $-1/2$. At $t=0^{+}$, the model predicts an infinite flux, corresponding to the infinitely steep initial concentration gradient.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{(C_{s} - C_{0})\\sqrt{\\frac{D}{\\pi t}}}\n$$"}, {"introduction": "Building on the fundamentals of diffusion, we now move to a common engineering application: the transfer of a species between gas and liquid phases.

Taking the gradient of $\\mu_A$ yields:\n$$ \\nabla \\mu_A = RT \\nabla(\\ln a_A) $$\nUsing the chain rule, we can relate the gradient of $\\ln a_A$ to the gradient of the mole fraction $x_A$:\n$$ \\nabla \\mu_A = RT \\left( \\frac{d(\\ln a_A)}{dx_A} \\right) \\nabla x_A $$\nWe now substitute this expression for $\\nabla \\mu_A$ back into the flux equation:\n$$ N_A = - c \\mathcal{D}_{AB} \\frac{x_A}{RT} \\left[ RT \\left( \\frac{d(\\ln a_A)}{dx_A} \\right) \\nabla x_A \\right] $$\n$$ N_A = - c \\mathcal{D}_{AB} \\left( x_A \\frac{d(\\ln a_A)}{dx_A} \\right) \\nabla x_A $$\nBy comparing this result with the definition of the effective Fickian diffusivity, $N_A = -c D_{\\text{eff}} \\nabla x_A$, we can identify $D_{\\text{eff}}$ as:\n$$ D_{\\text{eff}} = \\mathcal{D}_{AB} \\left( x_A \\frac{d(\\ln a_A)}{dx_A} \\right) $$\nThe term in parentheses is the thermodynamic factor, denoted by $\\Gamma$:\n$$ \\Gamma = x_A \\frac{d(\\ln a_A)}{dx_A} $$\nThis factor accounts for the deviation of the mixture from ideal behavior. We must now evaluate this factor using the provided activity model: $\\ln \\gamma_A = A x_B^2$.\nFirst, we write $\\ln a_A = \\ln(\\gamma_A x_A) = \\ln \\gamma_A + \\ln x_A = A x_B^2 + \\ln x_A$.\nSince $x_A + x_B = 1$, we have $x_B = 1 - x_A$. Thus, $\\ln a_A = A(1 - x_A)^2 + \\ln x_A$.\nNow, we differentiate with respect to $x_A$:\n$$ \\frac{d(\\ln a_A)}{dx_A} = A \\cdot 2(1 - x_A)(-1) + \\frac{1}{x_A} = -2A(1 - x_A) + \\frac{1}{x_A} = -2A x_B + \\frac{1}{x_A} $$\nThe thermodynamic factor is then:\n$$ \\Gamma = x_A \\left( -2A x_B + \\frac{1}{x_A} \\right) = 1 - 2A x_A x_B $$\nThe problem requires a physically justified relation between the Maxwell–Stefan diffusivity $\\mathcal{D}_{AB}$ and the tracer diffusivities $D_A^*$ and $D_B^*$. For liquid mixtures, the Darken relation provides such a connection, which models the Maxwell–Stefan diffusivity as a mole-fraction-weighted average of the tracer diffusivities:\n$$ \\mathcal{D}_{AB} = x_B D_A^* + x_A D_B^* $$\nCombining these results, the final expression for the effective Fickian diffusivity is:\n$$ D_{\\text{eff}} = (x_B D_A^* + x_A D_B^*) (1 - 2A x_A x_B) $$\nWe are given the following values:\n$x_A = 0.40$\n$x_B = 0.60$\n$A = 0.80$\n$D_A^* = 1.2 \\times 10^{-9} \\text{ m}^2 \\text{s}^{-1}$\n$D_B^* = 0.9 \\times 10^{-9} \\text{ m}^2 \\text{s}^{-1}$\n\nFirst, we calculate the thermodynamic factor $\\Gamma$:\n$$ \\Gamma = 1 - 2(0.80)(0.40)(0.60) = 1 - 1.6(0.24) = 1 - 0.384 = 0.616 $$\nNext, we calculate the term involving tracer diffusivities:\n$$ x_B D_A^* + x_A D_B^* = (0.60)(1.2 \\times 10^{-9} \\text{ m}^2 \\text{s}^{-1}) + (0.40)(0.9 \\times 10^{-9} \\text{ m}^2 \\text{s}^{-1}) $$\n$$ x_B D_A^* + x_A D_B^* = 0.72 \\times 10^{-9} \\text{ m}^2 \\text{s}^{-1} + 0.36 \\times 10^{-9} \\text{ m}^2 \\text{s}^{-1} = 1.08 \\times 10^{-9} \\text{ m}^2 \\text{s}^{-1} $$\nFinally, we compute $D_{\\text{eff}}$:\n$$ D_{\\text{eff}} = (1.08 \\times 10^{-9} \\text{ m}^2 \\text{s}^{-1}) \\times (0.616) $$\n$$ D_{\\text{eff}} = 0.66528 \\times 10^{-9} \\text{ m}^2 \\text{s}^{-1} $$\nIn standard scientific notation, this is $6.6528 \\times 10^{-10} \\text{ m}^2 \\text{s}^{-1}$. Rounding to three significant figures as required:\n$$ D_{\\text{eff}} \\approx 6.65 \\times 10^{-10} \\text{ m}^2 \\text{s}^{-1} $$\nThis concludes the derivation and calculation.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{6.65 \\times 10^{-10}}$$"}]}
