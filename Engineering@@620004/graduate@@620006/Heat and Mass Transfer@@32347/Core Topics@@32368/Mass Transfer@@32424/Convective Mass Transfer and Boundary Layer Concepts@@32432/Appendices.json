The provided values for $\\nu$ and $D$ are physically realistic for water and a small solute at the given temperature. The question is well-posed, objective, and contains sufficient information for a unique solution. Therefore, the problem is valid.\n\nWe now proceed with the solution.\n\nThe transport of momentum in an incompressible fluid is described by the Navier-Stokes equation. The term responsible for momentum diffusion (viscous effects) is $\\nu \\nabla^2 \\mathbf{v}$, where $\\nu$ is the kinematic viscosity, or momentum diffusivity. Its units are $\\mathrm{m^2/s}$.\n\nThe transport of a dilute solute is described by the species transport equation. The term responsible for mass diffusion is $D \\nabla^2 c$, where $D$ is the mass diffusivity of the solute. Its units are also $\\mathrm{m^2/s}$.\n\nThe problem asks for the dimensionless group that quantifies the ratio of momentum diffusion to mass diffusion. This ratio is formed by dividing the momentum diffusivity by the mass diffusivity:\n$$ \\text{Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Momentum Diffusivity}}{\\text{Mass Diffusivity}} = \\frac{\\nu}{D} $$\nThis dimensionless group is known as the Schmidt number, denoted by $Sc$.\n$$ Sc = \\frac{\\nu}{D} $$\nUsing the provided values:\n$$ \\nu = 1.0 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{m^{2}/s} $$\n$$ D = 1.0 \\times 10^{-9}\\,\\mathrm{m^{2}/s} $$\nWe calculate the value of the Schmidt number:\n$$ Sc = \\frac{1.0 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{m^{2}/s}}{1.0 \\times 10^{-9}\\,\\mathrm{m^{2}/s}} = 1000 $$\n\nNext, we must explain from first principles what the magnitude of this group implies. A value of $Sc = 1000$ indicates that $Sc \\gg 1$. This means that momentum diffuses much more rapidly through the fluid than mass does.\n\nTo understand the implications for boundary layers, we perform a scaling analysis for transport in a boundary layer of characteristic length $L$ and free-stream velocity $U$. The boundary layer is the region near a surface where viscous and diffusive effects are significant. Let $\\delta_v$ be the thickness of the velocity (or hydrodynamic) boundary layer and $\\delta_c$ be the thickness of the concentration boundary layer.\n\nWithin the velocity boundary layer, the convective acceleration term must be of the same order of magnitude as the viscous diffusion term. For steady, two-dimensional flow, the momentum equation scales as:\n$$ \\underbrace{u \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x}}_{\\text{convection}} \\sim \\underbrace{\\nu \\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial y^2}}_{\\text{diffusion}} $$\n$$ \\frac{U \\cdot U}{L} \\sim \\nu \\frac{U}{\\delta_v^2} \\implies \\delta_v^2 \\sim \\frac{\\nu L}{U} \\implies \\delta_v \\sim \\sqrt{\\frac{\\nu L}{U}} $$\nSimilarly, within the concentration boundary layer, the convective transport term must balance the mass diffusion term:\n$$ \\underbrace{u \\frac{\\partial c}{\\partial x}}_{\\text{convection}} \\sim \\underbrace{D \\frac{\\partial^2 c}{\\partial y^2}}_{\\text{diffusion}} $$\n$$ \\frac{U \\cdot \\Delta c}{L} \\sim D \\frac{\\Delta c}{\\delta_c^2} \\implies \\delta_c^2 \\sim \\frac{D L}{U} \\implies \\delta_c \\sim \\sqrt{\\frac{D L}{U}} $$\nThe ratio of the boundary layer thicknesses can now be determined:\n$$ \\frac{\\delta_v}{\\delta_c} \\sim \\frac{\\sqrt{\\nu L / U}}{\\sqrt{D L / U}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\nu}{D}} = Sc^{1/2} $$\nFor the given case where $Sc = 1000$, we have:\n$$ \\frac{\\delta_v}{\\delta_c} \\approx \\sqrt{1000} \\approx 31.6 $$\nThis result, derived from first principles, shows that the velocity boundary layer is significantly thicker than the concentration boundary layer. The effect of the wall on fluid velocity is felt much farther into the flow than its effect on solute concentration.\n\nFinally, we consider the implications for mass transfer rates in laminar versus turbulent flows. The rate of mass transfer is characterized by the mass transfer coefficient, $k_c$, which is related to the flux at the wall, $j_w = -D (\\partial c/\\partial y)_{y=0}$. By definition, $j_w = k_c (c_w - c_\\infty)$. Approximating the gradient as $\\Delta c / \\delta_c$, we find $k_c \\sim D/\\delta_c$. A thinner concentration boundary layer $\\delta_c$ leads to a steeper concentration gradient and thus a higher mass transfer coefficient $k_c$.\n\nIn laminar flow, transport is orderly, and $\\delta_c$ is determined by the balance derived above.\nIn turbulent flow, chaotic eddies dominate transport in the bulk of the flow, greatly enhancing mixing. However, very near the wall, turbulence is suppressed, and a viscous sublayer exists where transport is controlled by molecular diffusion. For a high Schmidt number fluid ($Sc \\gg 1$), the concentration boundary layer is much thinner than the velocity boundary layer. In a turbulent flow, this means the concentration boundary layer is contained deep within the viscous sublayer, where the flow is locally laminar.\n\nThe effect of turbulence is to dramatically thin this sublayer compared to the overall boundary layer thickness in a purely laminar flow. Turbulent eddies effectively transport solute from the free stream to the edge of this thin diffusive sublayer, steepening the concentration profile across it. Since $k_c \\sim 1/\\delta_c$, the substantially smaller $\\delta_c$ in turbulent flow results in a much higher mass transfer rate compared to laminar flow. The large value of $Sc$ signifies that even in a highly turbulent flow, the ultimate bottleneck for mass transfer is the slow molecular diffusion ($D$) across a very thin layer adjacent to the surface, and a primary effect of turbulence is to make this rate-limiting layer as thin as possible.", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{1.00 \\times 10^{3}} $$", "id": "2477339"}, {"introduction": "Having established the importance of the Schmidt number, we now delve into the detailed structure of the boundary layer itself, particularly in the common high-$Sc$ limit where mass diffusion is slow compared to momentum diffusion.

The governing equations—the boundary layer approximations of the Navier-Stokes and advection-diffusion equations—are fundamental. The physical scenario of flow over a flat plate is a canonical problem. The large Schmidt number limit is a physically relevant and well-studied asymptotic regime, particularly for mass transfer in liquids. The problem statement is objective, using precise, technical language. It is self-contained, providing all necessary information for an order-of-magnitude analysis. The problem is well-posed and seeks a scaling law, which is a standard and meaningful outcome in physical sciences. There are no scientific unsoundness, internal contradictions, or ambiguities.\n\nStep 3: Verdict and Action.\nThe problem statement is valid. A complete, reasoned solution will now be provided.\n\nThe analysis begins with the steady, two-dimensional, incompressible boundary-layer equations for conservation of mass, momentum, and solute concentration:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x} + \\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial y} = 0 $$\n$$ u \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x} + v \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial y} = \\nu \\frac{\\partial^{2} u}{\\partial y^{2}} $$\n$$ u \\frac{\\partial C}{\\partial x} + v \\frac{\\partial C}{\\partial y} = D \\frac{\\partial^{2} C}{\\partial y^{2}} $$\nHere, $u$ and $v$ are the velocity components in the streamwise ($x$) and wall-normal ($y$) directions, respectively.\n\nFirst, we determine the scaling for the hydrodynamic boundary layer thickness $\\delta(x)$. We perform an order-of-magnitude analysis on the momentum equation. The characteristic scales are: $u \\sim U_{\\infty}$, $x \\sim x$, and for the wall-normal direction, $y \\sim \\delta(x)$ and $\\partial/\\partial y \\sim 1/\\delta$. From the continuity equation, the wall-normal velocity scales as $v \\sim U_{\\infty} \\delta / x$. The inertial terms in the momentum equation, $u \\partial u/\\partial x$ and $v \\partial u/\\partial y$, are both of order $U_{\\infty}^{2}/x$. The viscous term scales as $\\nu \\partial^{2}u/\\partial y^{2} \\sim \\nu U_{\\infty}/\\delta^{2}$. The fundamental balance in a boundary layer is between inertia and viscous forces. Equating their orders of magnitude yields:\n$$ \\frac{U_{\\infty}^{2}}{x} \\sim \\nu \\frac{U_{\\infty}}{\\delta^{2}} $$\nSolving for $\\delta$ gives the scaling for the hydrodynamic boundary layer thickness:\n$$ \\delta(x) \\sim \\sqrt{\\frac{\\nu x}{U_{\\infty}}} $$\n\nSecond, we infer the magnitude of the local shear rate near the wall, $\\dot{\\gamma}_{w}(x) \\equiv \\left. \\partial u/\\partial y \\right|_{y=0}$. The velocity $u$ increases from $0$ at the wall ($y=0$) to approximately $U_{\\infty}$ at the edge of the boundary layer ($y \\sim \\delta$). Therefore, the velocity gradient at the wall scales as:\n$$ \\dot{\\gamma}_{w}(x) \\sim \\frac{U_{\\infty}}{\\delta(x)} \\sim \\frac{U_{\\infty}}{\\sqrt{\\nu x / U_{\\infty}}} = U_{\\infty}^{3/2} (\\nu x)^{-1/2} $$\nThis is the shear rate experienced by the fluid within the thin concentration sublayer.\n\nThird, we formulate the leading-order balance for the inner concentration sublayer. The condition $\\mathrm{Sc} \\gg 1$ implies $\\delta_{c} \\ll \\delta$. Within this sublayer, where $y \\sim \\delta_{c}$, the velocity profile can be approximated by the first term of its Taylor series expansion, which is a linear profile: $u(x,y) \\approx y (\\partial u/\\partial y)|_{y=0} = y \\dot{\\gamma}_{w}(x)$. This is the key feature of the Lévêque approximation. The concentration field $C$ changes from $C_w$ to $C_{\\infty}$ across this layer. The governing equation is the advection-diffusion equation. The Lévêque scaling arises from the dominant balance between streamwise advection and wall-normal diffusion. Advection in the $x$-direction is driven by the local velocity $u(y)$, and diffusion in the $y$-direction is driven by the steep concentration gradient.\n- Streamwise Advection: $u \\frac{\\partial C}{\\partial x} \\sim (y \\dot{\\gamma}_{w}) \\frac{\\Delta C}{x} \\sim (\\delta_{c} \\dot{\\gamma}_{w}) \\frac{\\Delta C}{x}$.\n- Wall-Normal Diffusion: $D \\frac{\\partial^{2} C}{\\partial y^{2}} \\sim D \\frac{\\Delta C}{\\delta_{c}^{2}}$.\nThe vertical advection term, $v \\partial C/\\partial y$, is of the same order as the streamwise advection term but is neglected in the leading-order formulation that gives the Lévêque scaling. This simplification correctly captures the primary physical mechanism where a species is advected by a shear flow and diffuses towards the wall. Equating the orders of magnitude of the dominant terms:\n$$ \\dot{\\gamma}_{w} \\delta_{c} \\frac{\\Delta C}{x} \\sim D \\frac{\\Delta C}{\\delta_{c}^{2}} $$\nThis provides the scaling relationship for the concentration sublayer:\n$$ \\delta_{c}^{3}(x) \\sim \\frac{D x}{\\dot{\\gamma}_{w}(x)} $$\n\nFourth, we close the scaling analysis to find an expression for $\\delta_{c}(L)$. We substitute the scaling for the wall shear rate $\\dot{\\gamma}_{w}(x)$ into the relationship for $\\delta_{c}(x)$:\n$$ \\delta_{c}^{3}(x) \\sim D x \\left( \\frac{U_{\\infty}^{3/2}}{(\\nu x)^{1/2}} \\right)^{-1} = D x \\frac{(\\nu x)^{1/2}}{U_{\\infty}^{3/2}} = \\frac{D \\nu^{1/2} x^{3/2}}{U_{\\infty}^{3/2}} $$\nTaking the cube root gives the scaling for the concentration boundary layer thickness as a function of $x$:\n$$ \\delta_{c}(x) \\sim \\left( \\frac{D \\nu^{1/2}}{U_{\\infty}^{3/2}} \\right)^{1/3} x^{1/2} $$\nWe evaluate this at the end of the plate, $x=L$:\n$$ \\delta_{c}(L) \\sim D^{1/3} \\nu^{1/6} U_{\\infty}^{-1/2} L^{1/2} $$\nFinally, we express this result in terms of the given dimensionless parameters $L$, $\\mathrm{Re}_{L} = U_{\\infty} L / \\nu$, and $\\mathrm{Sc} = \\nu / D$.
