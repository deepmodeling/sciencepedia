All necessary conditions and parameters for a unique and meaningful solution are provided. The problem is valid.\n\nThe derivation proceeds from the fundamental principles of mass transfer as required.\n\nThe total molar flux of species $A$, denoted $N_A$, in a binary mixture is the sum of its diffusive flux, $J_A$, and its convective flux. The convective flux is the transport of species $A$ due to the bulk motion of the mixture, given by its mole fraction $y_A$ times the total molar flux $(N_A + N_B)$. The relationship is expressed as:\n$$\nN_A = J_A + y_A (N_A + N_B)\n$$\nThe problem considers one-dimensional transport in the $z$-direction.

Therefore:\n$$\nN_B = 0\n$$\nApplying this condition to the flux equation for species $A$ simplifies it to:\n$$\nN_A = -c D_{AB} \\frac{dy_A}{dz} + y_A N_A\n$$\nThis equation must be solved for $N_A$. The term $y_A N_A$ accounts for the convective transport of species $A$ by the bulk flow, which is itself generated by the evaporation of species $A$. This induced bulk flow is known as the Stefan flow.\n\nTo solve for $N_A$, we rearrange the equation to separate the variables $y_A$ and $z$.\n$$\nN_A - y_A N_A = -c D_{AB} \\frac{dy_A}{dz}\n$$\n$$\nN_A (1 - y_A) = -c D_{AB} \\frac{dy_A}{dz}\n$$\nSince we are at steady state, the molar flux $N_A$ is constant along the diffusion path $z$.
