It contains all necessary information for a unique solution. Therefore, we proceed with the derivation.\n\nThe analysis begins with the differential form of the species conservation equation in one dimension, which states that the rate of change of concentration at a point is the sum of the net flux divergence and the volumetric rate of chemical production.\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial c}{\\partial t} = -\\frac{\\partial J_x}{\\partial x} + R\n$$\nHere, $c$ is the species concentration, $t$ is time, $J_x$ is the molar flux in the $x$-direction, and $R$ is the volumetric reaction rate.\n\nThe problem specifies several conditions:\n$1$. **Steady-state**: The system does not change in time, thus $\\frac{\\partial c}{\\partial t} = 0$.\n$2$. **No convection**: Transport occurs only by diffusion.

The characteristic equation is $m^2 - \\frac{k}{D} = 0$, which has two real roots $m = \\pm \\sqrt{k/D}$. The general solution can be written using hyperbolic functions, which is convenient given the symmetry of the domain $x \\in [-L, L]$ and boundary conditions:\n$$\nc(x) = C_1 \\cosh\\left(x \\sqrt{\\frac{k}{D}}\\right) + C_2 \\sinh\\left(x \\sqrt{\\frac{k}{D}}\\right)\n$$\nThe problem states symmetric Dirichlet boundary conditions: $c(-L) = c_s$ and $c(L) = c_s$. The physical symmetry of the boundary conditions and the domain dictates that the solution $c(x)$ must be an even function, i.e., $c(x) = c(-x)$. Since $\\cosh(u)$ is an even function and $\\sinh(u)$ is an odd function, the coefficient $C_2$ of the odd sine hyperbolic term must be zero to satisfy this symmetry. Thus, $C_2=0$, and the solution simplifies to:\n$$\nc(x) = C_1 \\cosh\\left(x \\sqrt{\\frac{k}{D}}\\right)\n$$\nWe determine the remaining constant, $C_1$, by applying the boundary condition at $x=L$:\n$$\nc(L) = c_s = C_1 \\cosh\\left(L \\sqrt{\\frac{k}{D}}\\right)\n$$\nSolving for $C_1$:\n$$\nC_1 = \\frac{c_s}{\\cosh\\left(L \\sqrt{\\frac{k}{D}}\\right)}\n$$\nSubstituting this back into the solution for $c(x)$ gives the final expression for the concentration profile:\n$$\nc(x) = c_s \\frac{\\cosh\\left(x \\sqrt{\\frac{k}{D}}\\right)}{\\cosh\\left(L \\sqrt{\\frac{k}{D}}\\right)}\n$$\nThe problem defines the Thiele modulus as $\\phi \\equiv L \\sqrt{k/D}$.

When $\\phi \\ll 1$, the diffusion rate is much greater than the reaction rate. The reactant can penetrate deep into the slab before it is consumed. The concentration profile is nearly flat, $c(x) \\approx c_s$, and the internal gradients are small. The overall process is limited by the chemical reaction kinetics. Conversely, when $\\phi \\gg 1$, the reaction rate is much faster than the diffusion rate. The reactant is consumed rapidly upon entering the slab. The concentration drops sharply near the surfaces at $x = \\pm L$ and is close to zero in the slab's interior. The internal concentration gradients are large, and the overall process is limited by the rate at which the reactant can be supplied by diffusion.\n\nThe final task is to find the normalized centerline concentration, $c(0)/c_s$.

A solution will be furnished.\n\nThe one-dimensional steady species conservation statement is that the divergence of the molar flux $J_A(x)$ balances the production rate $R_A(x)$. In one dimension, this is expressed as:\n$$\n\\frac{dJ_A}{dx} = R_A(x)\n$$\nSubstituting Fick's first law, $J_A(x) = -D \\frac{dC_A}{dx}$, into the conservation equation gives:\n$$\n\\frac{d}{dx}\\left(-D \\frac{dC_A}{dx}\\right) = R_A(x)\n$$\nAs the diffusivity $D$ is constant, we obtain the governing differential equation for the molar concentration $C_A(x)$:\n$$\n-D \\frac{d^2C_A}{dx^2} = R_A(x)\n$$\nThis equation is of the form $\\mathcal{L}C_A(x) = f(x)$, where the linear differential operator is $\\mathcal{L} = -D \\frac{d^2}{dx^2}$ and the source term is $f(x)=R_A(x)$.

The condition $G(0,\\xi)=0$ implies $B_1=0$, so $G(x,\\xi) = A_1 x$.\nFor $x  \\xi$, $G(x,\\xi) = A_2 x + B_2$. The condition $G(L,\\xi)=0$ implies $A_2 L + B_2 = 0$, so $B_2 = -A_2 L$.

Uniqueness is guaranteed if the corresponding homogeneous problem, $\\mathcal{L}u=0$ with homogeneous boundary conditions, admits only the trivial solution $u=0$. The general solution to $\\mathcal{L}u=-Du''=0$ is $u(x) = Ax+B$.\nFor any combination of Dirichlet ($u=0$), Neumann ($u'=0$), or Robin ($\\alpha u + \\beta u' = 0$ with appropriate signs for $\\alpha, \\beta$) conditions at $x=0$ and $x=L$, as long as at least one of the conditions is not of the pure Neumann type, the only solution to the homogeneous problem is $A=0$ and $B=0$. Therefore, uniqueness of the steady solution is guaranteed by any set of two boundary conditions, provided they are not both of the Neumann type.\nIf both boundary conditions are of the Neumann type (prescribed fluxes), e.g., $C_A'(0) = f_0$ and $C_A'(L) = f_L$, the homogeneous problem $u'(0)=0, u'(L)=0$ is solved by $u(x)=B$ for any constant $B$. The solution is not unique; it is determined only up to an additive constant.

Let $C_{tr}(x,t) = X(x)T(t)$. Substituting into the transient PDE gives $X(x)T'(t) = D X''(x)T(t)$. Separating variables yields:\n$$\\frac{T'(t)}{D T(t)} = \\frac{X''(x)}{X(x)} = -\\lambda^2$$\nwhere $-\\lambda^2$ is the separation constant. This leads to two ordinary differential equations:\n$$T'(t) + D \\lambda^2 T(t) = 0$$\n$$X''(x) + \\lambda^2 X(x) = 0$$\nThe general solution for $X(x)$ is $X(x) = c_1 \\cos(\\lambda x) + c_2 \\sin(\\lambda x)$. We apply the homogeneous boundary conditions for $C_{tr}$:\n- $X(0) = 0 \\implies c_1 \\cos(0) + c_2 \\sin(0) = c_1 = 0$. So, $X(x) = c_2 \\sin(\\lambda x)$.\n- $X'(L) = 0 \\implies c_2 \\lambda \\cos(\\lambda L) = 0$.\nFor a non-trivial solution, we require $c_2 \\neq 0$ and $\\lambda \\neq 0$. Therefore, we must have:\n$$\\cos(\\lambda L) = 0$$\nThis is the **eigenvalue condition**. It dictates the permissible values for the separation constant $\\lambda$. The solutions are $\\lambda L = \\frac{(2n+1)\\pi}{2}$ for $n=0, 1, 2, \\dots$. The eigenvalues are:\n$$\\lambda_n = \\frac{(2n+1)\\pi}{2L}, \\quad n=0, 1, 2, \\dots$$\nThe corresponding **orthogonal eigenfunctions** are:\n$$X_n(x) = \\sin(\\lambda_n x) = \\sin\\left(\\frac{(2n+1)\\pi x}{2L}\\right)$$\nThe solution for the time-dependent part is $T_n(t) = \\exp(-D \\lambda_n^2 t)$. The full transient solution is a superposition of all product solutions:\n$$C_{tr}(x,t) = \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} A_n X_n(x) T_n(t) = \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} A_n \\sin\\left(\\frac{(2n+1)\\pi x}{2L}\\right) \\exp\\left(-D\\left(\\frac{(2n+1)\\pi}{2L}\\right)^2 t\\right)$$\nThe coefficients $A_n$ are determined from the initial condition $C_{tr}(x,0) = C_i - C_0$:\n$$C_i - C_0 = \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} A_n \\sin\\left(\\frac{(2n+1)\\pi x}{2L}\\right)$$\nUsing the orthogonality property of the eigenfunctions on the interval $[0, L]$, $\\int_0^L \\sin(\\lambda_n x)\\sin(\\lambda_m x)dx = \\frac{L}{2}\\delta_{nm}$, we can find $A_n$:\n$$A_n = \\frac{\\int_0^L (C_i - C_0) \\sin(\\lambda_n x) dx}{\\int_0^L \\sin^2(\\lambda_n x) dx}$$\nThe numerator is:\n$$\\int_0^L (C_i - C_0) \\sin\\left(\\frac{(2n+1)\\pi x}{2L}\\right) dx = (C_i - C_0) \\left[-\\frac{\\cos\\left(\\frac{(2n+1)\\pi x}{2L}\\right)}{\\frac{(2n+1)\\pi}{2L}}\\right]_0^L$$\n$$= (C_i - C_0) \\frac{2L}{(2n+1)\\pi} \\left[-\\cos\\left(\\frac{(2n+1)\\pi}{2}\\right) + \\cos(0)\\right] = (C_i - C_0) \\frac{2L}{(2n+1)\\pi}$$\nThe denominator is $\\frac{L}{2}$. Therefore, the coefficients are:\n$$A_n = \\frac{(C_i - C_0) \\frac{2L}{(2n+1)\\pi}}{\\frac{L}{2}} = \\frac{4(C_i - C_0)}{(2n+1)\\pi}$$\nThe complete solution for $C(x,t)$ is obtained by combining the steady-state and transient parts:\n$$C(x,t) = C_0 + \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} \\frac{4(C_i - C_0)}{(2n+1)\\pi} \\sin\\left(\\frac{(2n+1)\\pi x}{2L}\\right) \\exp\\left(-D\\left(\\frac{(2n+1)\\pi}{2L}\\right)^2 t\\right)$$\nThe principal decay rate $\\alpha_0$ is the smallest non-zero temporal decay constant. The decay constants are $D\\lambda_n^2$. The smallest value occurs for $n=0$:\n$$\\alpha_0 = D \\lambda_0^2 = D \\left(\\frac{(2(0)+1)\\pi}{2L}\\right)^2 = D\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2L}\\right)^2$$\nWe are given $L = 2.00 \\times 10^{-3} \\, \\text{m}$ and $D = 1.50 \\times 10^{-9} \\, \\text{m}^2\\,\\text{s}^{-1}$.
