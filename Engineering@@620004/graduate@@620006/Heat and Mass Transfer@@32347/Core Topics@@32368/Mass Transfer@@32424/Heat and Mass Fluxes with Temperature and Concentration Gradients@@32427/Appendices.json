The governing equations consist of conservation laws and linear phenomenological relations, which is a standard and valid approach. The problem is well-posed: it provides two governing equations for two unknown fields, $T(x)$ and $x_A(x)$, with a total of four boundary conditions, which are required for a system that reduces to two simultaneous first-order ordinary differential equations. The statement is objective and uses precise scientific language. No scientific, logical, or factual flaws are detected. The assumption of constant phenomenological coefficients is a valid simplification for rendering the problem analytically solvable.\n\nStep 3: Verdict\nThe problem is valid. I will proceed with the derivation of the solution.\n\nThe derivation begins from the provided conservation laws for heat and mass. For a one-dimensional, steady-state system with no internal generation, the fluxes are constant throughout the domain.\n$$ \\frac{dJ_q}{dx} = 0 \\implies J_q(x) = C_1 $$\n$$ \\frac{dN_A}{dx} = 0 \\implies N_A(x) = C_2 $$\nwhere $C_1$ and $C_2$ are constants.\n\nWe substitute the given constitutive relations into these conservation equations:\n$$ -k\\,\\frac{dT}{dx} - k_{x}\\,\\frac{dx_A}{dx} = C_1 $$\n$$ -D\\,\\frac{dx_A}{dx} - D_{T}\\,\\frac{dT}{dx} = C_2 $$\n\nThis constitutes a system of two linear algebraic equations for the gradients $\\frac{dT}{dx}$ and $\\frac{dx_A}{dx}$.

The values provided are physically plausible. There are no internal contradictions or missing data.\n\nStep 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. A solution will be derived based on the principles of linear non-equilibrium thermodynamics.\n\nSolution Derivation:\nThe problem requires the calculation of the heat flux arising from a concentration gradient in an isothermal, isobaric binary mixture. This phenomenon is known as the Dufour effect. According to the principles of linear non-equilibrium thermodynamics, fluxes are linearly proportional to thermodynamic forces.\n\nIn this system, the heat flux in the $x$-direction, denoted as $J_q$, is driven by two potential forces: the gradient of temperature and the gradient of chemical potential (or concentration). The total heat flux is generally expressed as:\n$$ J_q = -k \\frac{dT}{dx} + J_{q, \\text{Dufour}} $$\nwhere the first term represents Fourier's law of heat conduction ($k$ is the thermal conductivity) and the second term is the heat flux due to the Dufour effect.\n\nThe problem states that the system is isothermal, which means the temperature $T$ is uniform. Therefore, the temperature gradient is zero:\n$$ \\frac{dT}{dx} = 0 $$\nConsequently, the heat flux component due to thermal conduction is zero, and the total heat flux is solely the Dufour flux:\n$$ J_q = J_{q, \\text{Dufour}} $$\n\nThe Dufour heat flux is linearly related to the gradient of the mole fraction. The problem provides a Dufour coefficient, $D_f$, with units of $\\mathrm{W/m}$. The mole fraction gradient, $\\frac{dx_A}{dx}$, has units of $\\mathrm{m}^{-1}$. For the product to yield a heat flux (units of $\\mathrm{W/m^2}$), the phenomenological law must take the form:\n$$ J_q = -D_f \\frac{dx_A}{dx} $$\nThe negative sign is a standard convention in transport phenomena, analogous to Fourier's law and Fick's law, indicating that for a positive coefficient, the flux is directed opposite to the gradient.\n\nThe problem states that the mole fraction $x_A(x)$ varies linearly with the position $x$ over the length $L$. This implies that the gradient $\\frac{dx_A}{dx}$ is constant throughout the channel. We can calculate this gradient using the given boundary conditions:\n$$ \\frac{dx_A}{dx} = \\frac{x_A(L) - x_A(0)}{L - 0} $$\nSubstituting the given values, $L = 0.006~\\mathrm{m}$, $x_A(0) = 0.65$, and $x_A(L) = 0.50$:\n$$ \\frac{dx_A}{dx} = \\frac{0.50 - 0.65}{0.006~\\mathrm{m}} = \\frac{-0.15}{0.006~\\mathrm{m}} = -25~\\mathrm{m}^{-1} $$\nThe gradient is constant and negative, indicating that the mole fraction of species $A$ decreases along the positive $x$-direction.\n\nNow, we can calculate the heat flux $J_q$ using the phenomenological law.

The thermal and concentration fields are\n- $T(x) = T_{0} + G_{T} x$ with uniform temperature gradient $G_{T}$, and\n- $c_{s}(x) = c_{0} \\exp(G_{c} x)$ with uniform logarithmic concentration gradient $G_{c} = \\partial_{x}\\ln c_{s}$.\n\nAssume that the particle is much larger than the interfacial interaction length scales (thin interfacial layer), and that gradients are weak so that Linear Irreversible Thermodynamics (LIT) applies. In this regime, a force-free particle acquires a drift velocity relative to the fluid due to interfacially generated phoretic slip. The drift is driven by both the temperature gradient (thermophoresis, often characterized by a Soret mobility) and the solute concentration gradient (diffusiophoresis). Let $M_{T}$ denote the thermophoretic (Soret) mobility, defined so that a positive $M_{T}$ corresponds to drift toward colder regions in a positive temperature gradient, and let $D_{\\mathrm{dp}}$ denote the diffusiophoretic mobility with respect to the solute, defined so that a positive $D_{\\mathrm{dp}}$ corresponds to drift toward higher solute concentration in a positive logarithmic concentration gradient.\n\nStarting from the statement of LIT that, near equilibrium, fluxes are linear in the independent thermodynamic forces, and using the force-free, thin-layer phoretic-slip mechanism at the particle interface, derive the linear superposition form of the particle’s drift velocity along $x$ in terms of $M_{T}$, $D_{\\mathrm{dp}}$, $G_{T}$, and $G_{c}$.

In LIT, the entropy production density is written as a sum over products of fluxes and their conjugate thermodynamic forces. Near equilibrium, each flux is a linear combination of all forces consistent with symmetry and conservation laws (Onsager’s theory). For a dilute, force-free colloidal particle, the relevant “flux” is the particle velocity $u_{x}$ relative to the ambient fluid, and the independent thermodynamic forces available in the present problem are the gradients of temperature and solute chemical potential.\n\nUnder the thin-interfacial-layer approximation (interaction layer thickness $\\ll a$), gradients in scalar fields (such as $T$ and $c_{s}$) induce tangential stresses along the particle’s surface and a corresponding interfacial slip velocity. In the Stokes-flow, force-free limit, the particle acquires a finite drift velocity equal to the surface-average of this slip. To leading order in weak gradients, the slip is linear in the tangential gradients of the fields, and isotropy at the particle scale together with LIT implies that the resulting drift velocity must be a linear superposition of the available gradients. In one dimension, along $x$, this linear constitutive relation can be written as\n$$\nu_{x} \\;=\\; \\alpha\\,\\partial_{x} T \\;+\\; \\beta\\,\\partial_{x}\\mu_{s},\n$$\nwhere $\\mu_{s}$ is the solute chemical potential, and $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ are phenomenological coefficients determined by interfacial physics (they are even under time reversal and therefore allowed by Onsager symmetry).
