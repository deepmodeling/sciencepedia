The boundary mole fractions of species $A$ at $z=0$ and $z=L$ are $y_{A1}$ and $y_{A2}$, respectively, and the system has been arranged so that the net molar flux (the molar-average convection) through the film is zero, corresponding to equimolar counterdiffusion.

Therefore, a solution is warranted.\n\nThe problem requires the derivation of the diffusive molar fluxes, $J_{A}$ and $J_{B}$, for a binary ideal-gas mixture under conditions of equimolar counterdiffusion at steady state. The derivation must begin from first principles, namely the species continuity equation and the Maxwell–Stefan framework.\n\nFirst, we establish the governing equations for mass transfer in a one-dimensional, stationary, planar film of thickness $L$. The system is at uniform temperature $T$ and pressure $P$. There are no homogeneous chemical reactions.\n\nThe species continuity equation for species $i$ at steady state ($\\frac{\\partial c_i}{\\partial t} = 0$) with no reaction ($R_i=0$) is:\n$$ \\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{N}_i = 0 $$\nIn one dimension, with the coordinate $z$ oriented across the film, this simplifies to:\n$$ \\frac{dN_i}{dz} = 0 $$\nThis equation implies that the total molar flux of species $i$, $N_i$, is constant with respect to position $z$ across the film.\n\nThe total molar flux $N_i$ is composed of a diffusive component $J_i$ relative to the molar-average velocity and a convective component due to the bulk motion of the fluid:\n$$ N_i = J_i + y_i N $$\nwhere $y_i$ is the mole fraction of species $i$ and $N$ is the total molar flux of the mixture, given by $N = \\sum_i N_i$.\n\nThe problem states that the system exhibits equimolar counterdiffusion, which is defined by the condition that the net molar flux is zero:\n$$ N = N_A + N_B = 0 $$\nFrom this condition, it directly follows that $N_A = -N_B$. Substituting the zero net molar flux condition into the expression for the total flux of species A gives:\n$$ N_A = J_A + y_A (0) \\implies N_A = J_A $$\nSimilarly, for species B:\n$$ N_B = J_B + y_B (0) \\implies N_B = J_B $$\nThus, for equimolar counterdiffusion, the total molar flux of each species is equal to its diffusive flux. The condition $N_A = -N_B$ therefore implies $J_A = -J_B$, or $J_A + J_B = 0$. This fundamental relationship arises directly from the definition of the diffusive flux relative to the molar-average velocity and the condition $N=0$.\n\nWe now employ the Maxwell–Stefan equation for a binary, isothermal, isobaric system to relate the mole fraction gradient to the fluxes. For species A in one dimension, the equation is:\n$$ \\frac{dy_A}{dz} = \\frac{1}{c D_{AB}}(y_A N_B - y_B N_A) $$\nwhere $c$ is the total molar concentration and $D_{AB}$ is the binary diffusivity. Given the system is an ideal gas at uniform $T$ and $P$, $c = P/(RT)$ is constant. The diffusivity $D_{AB}$ is also given as constant.\n\nWe substitute the consequences of equimolar counterdiffusion, $N_B = -N_A$, and the identity $y_B = 1 - y_A$ into the Maxwell–Stefan equation:\n$$ \\frac{dy_A}{dz} = \\frac{1}{c D_{AB}}(y_A(-N_A) - (1-y_A)N_A) $$\n$$ \\frac{dy_A}{dz} = \\frac{N_A}{c D_{AB}}(-y_A - 1 + y_A) = -\\frac{N_A}{c D_{AB}} $$\nSince we established that $N_A = J_A$ and $J_A$ is constant (as $N_A$ is constant), we have a simple first-order ordinary differential equation:\n$$ J_A = -c D_{AB} \\frac{dy_A}{dz} $$\nThis equation is Fick's first law, which is a special case of the Maxwell-Stefan equations applicable under these specific conditions. We solve this equation by separating variables and integrating across the film thickness from $z=0$ to $z=L$, with the corresponding mole fraction boundary conditions $y_A(0)=y_{A1}$ and $y_A(L)=y_{A2}$:\n$$ \\int_{0}^{L} J_A dz = \\int_{y_{A1}}^{y_{A2}} -c D_{AB} dy_A $$\nSince $J_A$, $c$, and $D_{AB}$ are all constant:\n$$ J_A \\int_{0}^{L} dz = -c D_{AB} \\int_{y_{A1}}^{y_{A2}} dy_A $$\n$$ J_A [z]_0^L = -c D_{AB} [y_A]_{y_{A1}}^{y_{A2}} $$\n$$ J_A L = -c D_{AB} (y_{A2} - y_{A1}) $$\nThe expression for the diffusive molar flux of species A is therefore:\n$$ J_A = \\frac{c D_{AB}}{L} (y_{A1} - y_{A2}) $$\nThe flux of species B, $J_B$, is simply $-J_A$:\n$$ J_B = -J_A = \\frac{c D_{AB}}{L} (y_{A2} - y_{A1}) $$\nThe problem asks to verify that $J_A + J_B = 0$ by \"explicit calculation\". We can do this formally by deriving the expression for $J_B$ independently. The Maxwell-Stefan equation for species B is:\n$$ \\frac{dy_B}{dz} = \\frac{1}{c D_{BA}}(y_B N_A - y_A N_B) $$\nUsing $D_{BA}=D_{AB}$, $N_A = -N_B$, and $y_A+y_B=1$:\n$$ \\frac{dy_B}{dz} = \\frac{1}{c D_{AB}}(y_B(-N_B) - y_A N_B) = -\\frac{N_B}{c D_{AB}}(y_A+y_B) = -\\frac{N_B}{c D_{AB}} $$\nSince $N_B=J_B$, we integrate $J_B = -c D_{AB} \\frac{dy_B}{dz}$ from $z=0$ to $z=L$:\n$$ J_B = \\frac{c D_{AB}}{L}(y_{B1} - y_{B2}) $$\nwhere $y_{B1} = 1-y_{A1}$ and $y_{B2} = 1-y_{A2}$.
