This first practice focuses on equimolar counter-diffusion, a scenario where two species diffuse at equal and opposite molar rates. By deriving the flux equations from first principles and performing a calculation, you will reinforce the distinction between the diffusive flux $J_i$ and the total molar flux $N_i$ and see how the familiar Fick's first law arises as a special case of the more general Maxwell–Stefan framework when the net molar-average convection is zero [@problem_id:2476697].", "problem": "A binary, ideal-gas mixture of species $A$ and $B$ fills a stationary, planar film of thickness $L$ in one dimension, with coordinate $z$ measured from $z=0$ at one face to $z=L$ at the opposite face. The temperature is uniform at $T$, the pressure is uniform at $P$, and the binary diffusivity $D_{AB}$ is constant. The boundary mole fractions of species $A$ at $z=0$ and $z=L$ are $y_{A1}$ and $y_{A2}$, respectively, and the system has been arranged so that the net molar flux (the molar-average convection) through the film is zero, corresponding to equimolar counterdiffusion. Assume steady state and no homogeneous reaction.\n\nStarting from first principles appropriate to multicomponent diffusion in gases (species continuity and the Maxwell–Stefan framework under isothermal, isobaric conditions), derive the expressions for the one-dimensional diffusive molar fluxes $J_{A}$ and $J_{B}$ across the film and evaluate them numerically for the following data:\n- $L = 1.5 \\ \\mathrm{mm}$,\n- $y_{A1} = 0.65$, $y_{A2} = 0.25$,\n- $T = 340 \\ \\mathrm{K}$, $P = 1.00 \\times 10^{5} \\ \\mathrm{Pa}$,\n- $D_{AB} = 1.20 \\times 10^{-5} \\ \\mathrm{m^{2} \\ s^{-1}}$.\n\nUse the ideal-gas relation to obtain the total molar concentration $c$.

Express the fluxes in $\\mathrm{mol \\ m^{-2} \\ s^{-1}}$. The final answer must be the ordered pair $\\left(J_{A}, J_{B}\\right)$.", "solution": "The problem statement is critically examined and found to be valid. It is scientifically grounded in the principles of mass transfer, is well-posed with sufficient and consistent data, and is formulated objectively. Therefore, a solution is warranted.\n\nThe problem requires the derivation of the diffusive molar fluxes, $J_{A}$ and $J_{B}$, for a binary ideal-gas mixture under conditions of equimolar counterdiffusion at steady state. The derivation must begin from first principles, namely the species continuity equation and the Maxwell–Stefan framework.\n\nFirst, we establish the governing equations for mass transfer in a one-dimensional, stationary, planar film of thickness $L$. The system is at uniform temperature $T$ and pressure $P$. There are no homogeneous chemical reactions.\n\nThe species continuity equation for species $i$ at steady state ($\\frac{\\partial c_i}{\\partial t} = 0$) with no reaction ($R_i=0$) is:\n$$ \\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{N}_i = 0 $$\nIn one dimension, with the coordinate $z$ oriented across the film, this simplifies to:\n$$ \\frac{dN_i}{dz} = 0 $$\nThis equation implies that the total molar flux of species $i$, $N_i$, is constant with respect to position $z$ across the film.\n\nThe total molar flux $N_i$ is composed of a diffusive component $J_i$ relative to the molar-average velocity and a convective component due to the bulk motion of the fluid:\n$$ N_i = J_i + y_i N $$\nwhere $y_i$ is the mole fraction of species $i$ and $N$ is the total molar flux of the mixture, given by $N = \\sum_i N_i$.\n\nThe problem states that the system exhibits equimolar counterdiffusion, which is defined by the condition that the net molar flux is zero:\n$$ N = N_A + N_B = 0 $$\nFrom this condition, it directly follows that $N_A = -N_B$. Substituting the zero net molar flux condition into the expression for the total flux of species A gives:\n$$ N_A = J_A + y_A (0) \\implies N_A = J_A $$\nSimilarly, for species B:\n$$ N_B = J_B + y_B (0) \\implies N_B = J_B $$\nThus, for equimolar counterdiffusion, the total molar flux of each species is equal to its diffusive flux. The condition $N_A = -N_B$ therefore implies $J_A = -J_B$, or $J_A + J_B = 0$. This fundamental relationship arises directly from the definition of the diffusive flux relative to the molar-average velocity and the condition $N=0$.\n\nWe now employ the Maxwell–Stefan equation for a binary, isothermal, isobaric system to relate the mole fraction gradient to the fluxes. For species A in one dimension, the equation is:\n$$ \\frac{dy_A}{dz} = \\frac{1}{c D_{AB}}(y_A N_B - y_B N_A) $$\nwhere $c$ is the total molar concentration and $D_{AB}$ is the binary diffusivity. Given the system is an ideal gas at uniform $T$ and $P$, $c = P/(RT)$ is constant. The diffusivity $D_{AB}$ is also given as constant.\n\nWe substitute the consequences of equimolar counterdiffusion, $N_B = -N_A$, and the identity $y_B = 1 - y_A$ into the Maxwell–Stefan equation:\n$$ \\frac{dy_A}{dz} = \\frac{1}{c D_{AB}}(y_A(-N_A) - (1-y_A)N_A) $$\n$$ \\frac{dy_A}{dz} = \\frac{N_A}{c D_{AB}}(-y_A - 1 + y_A) = -\\frac{N_A}{c D_{AB}} $$\nSince we established that $N_A = J_A$ and $J_A$ is constant (as $N_A$ is constant), we have a simple first-order ordinary differential equation:\n$$ J_A = -c D_{AB} \\frac{dy_A}{dz} $$\nThis equation is Fick's first law, which is a special case of the Maxwell-Stefan equations applicable under these specific conditions. We solve this equation by separating variables and integrating across the film thickness from $z=0$ to $z=L$, with the corresponding mole fraction boundary conditions $y_A(0)=y_{A1}$ and $y_A(L)=y_{A2}$:\n$$ \\int_{0}^{L} J_A dz = \\int_{y_{A1}}^{y_{A2}} -c D_{AB} dy_A $$\nSince $J_A$, $c$, and $D_{AB}$ are all constant:\n$$ J_A \\int_{0}^{L} dz = -c D_{AB} \\int_{y_{A1}}^{y_{A2}} dy_A $$\n$$ J_A [z]_0^L = -c D_{AB} [y_A]_{y_{A1}}^{y_{A2}} $$\n$$ J_A L = -c D_{AB} (y_{A2} - y_{A1}) $$\nThe expression for the diffusive molar flux of species A is therefore:\n$$ J_A = \\frac{c D_{AB}}{L} (y_{A1} - y_{A2}) $$\nThe flux of species B, $J_B$, is simply $-J_A$:\n$$ J_B = -J_A = \\frac{c D_{AB}}{L} (y_{A2} - y_{A1}) $$\nThe problem asks to verify that $J_A + J_B = 0$ by \"explicit calculation\". We can do this formally by deriving the expression for $J_B$ independently. The Maxwell-Stefan equation for species B is:\n$$ \\frac{dy_B}{dz} = \\frac{1}{c D_{BA}}(y_B N_A - y_A N_B) $$\nUsing $D_{BA}=D_{AB}$, $N_A = -N_B$, and $y_A+y_B=1$:\n$$ \\frac{dy_B}{dz} = \\frac{1}{c D_{AB}}(y_B(-N_B) - y_A N_B) = -\\frac{N_B}{c D_{AB}}(y_A+y_B) = -\\frac{N_B}{c D_{AB}} $$\nSince $N_B=J_B$, we integrate $J_B = -c D_{AB} \\frac{dy_B}{dz}$ from $z=0$ to $z=L$:\n$$ J_B = \\frac{c D_{AB}}{L}(y_{B1} - y_{B2}) $$\nwhere $y_{B1} = 1-y_{A1}$ and $y_{B2} = 1-y_{A2}$.

We proceed to the solution.\n\nThe total molar flux of species $A$, denoted $N_A$, in a binary mixture is the sum of its diffusive flux, $J_A$, and its convective flux, which arises from the bulk motion of the fluid.

The gradient can thus be approximated using the boundary values:\n$$\n\\frac{d y_A}{dz} \\approx \\frac{y_{A,L} - y_{A,0}}{L - 0} = \\frac{y_{A,\\infty} - y_{A,s}}{L}\n$$\nSubstituting this linear approximation of the gradient into the simplified flux equation gives the linear-driving-force approximation, $N_{A,\\mathrm{lin}}$:\n$$\nN_{A,\\mathrm{lin}} = -c D_{AB} \\left(\\frac{y_{A,\\infty} - y_{A,s}}{L}\\right) = \\frac{c D_{AB}}{L}(y_{A,s} - y_{A,\\infty})\n$$\n\n**3) Relative Error Analysis**\n\nThe relative error function $E(y_{A,s})$ is defined as:\n$$\nE(y_{A,s}) \\equiv \\frac{N_{A,\\mathrm{lin}} - N_{A,\\mathrm{true}}}{N_{A,\\mathrm{true}}}\n$$\nSubstitute the derived expressions for $N_{A,\\mathrm{lin}}$ and $N_{A,\\mathrm{true}}$:\n$$\nE(y_{A,s}) = \\frac{\\frac{c D_{AB}}{L}(y_{A,s} - y_{A,\\infty}) - \\frac{c D_{AB}}{L} \\ln\\left(\\frac{1 - y_{A,\\infty}}{1 - y_{A,s}}\\right)}{\\frac{c D_{AB}}{L} \\ln\\left(\\frac{1 - y_{A,\\infty}}{1 - y_{A,s}}\\right)}\n$$\nThe common prefactor $\\frac{c D_{AB}}{L}$ cancels:\n$$\nE(y_{A,s}) = \\frac{y_{A,s} - y_{A,\\infty}}{\\ln\\left(\\frac{1 - y_{A,\\infty}}{1 - y_{A,s}}\\right)} - 1\n$$\nWe now apply the specific condition $y_{A,\\infty}=0$:\n$$\nE(y_{A,s}) = \\frac{y_{A,s}}{\\ln\\left(\\frac{1}{1 - y_{A,s}}\\right)} - 1\n$$\nUsing the logarithm property $\\ln(1/x) = -\\ln(x)$, we obtain the simplified error function:\n$$\nE(y_{A,s}) = \\frac{-y_{A,s}}{\\ln(1 - y_{A,s})} - 1\n$$\nWe must find the value of $y_{A,s}$ in the interval $[0, 0.80]$ that maximizes the magnitude $|E(y_{A,s})|$. To do this, we analyze the behavior of $E(y_{A,s})$ by examining its derivative with respect to $y_{A,s}$. Let $x = y_{A,s}$ for simplicity.\n$$\n\\frac{dE}{dx} = \\frac{d}{dx} \\left( \\frac{-x}{\\ln(1-x)} - 1 \\right)\n$$\nUsing the quotient rule:\n$$\n\\frac{dE}{dx} = \\frac{(-1)\\ln(1-x) - (-x)\\left(\\frac{-1}{1-x}\\right)}{(\\ln(1-x))^2} = \\frac{-\\ln(1-x) - \\frac{x}{1-x}}{(\\ln(1-x))^2}\n$$\nTo determine the sign of the derivative, we analyze the numerator, let's call it $g(x) = -\\ln(1-x) - \\frac{x}{1-x}$.\nFirst, we evaluate $g(x)$ at $x=0$: $g(0) = -\\ln(1) - 0 = 0$.\nNext, we examine the derivative of $g(x)$:\n$$\ng'(x) = \\frac{d}{dx}\\left(-\\ln(1-x) - \\frac{x}{1-x}\\right) = \\frac{1}{1-x} - \\frac{(1)(1-x) - (x)(-1)}{(1-x)^2} = \\frac{1}{1-x} - \\frac{1}{(1-x)^2}\n$$\n$$\ng'(x) = \\frac{(1-x)-1}{(1-x)^2} = \\frac{-x}{(1-x)^2}\n$$\nFor any $x$ in the domain $(0, 1)$, $g'(x)$ is strictly negative. This means that the function $g(x)$ is strictly decreasing from its value of $g(0)=0$. Consequently, $g(x) < 0$ for all $x \\in (0, 1)$.\n\nSince the numerator of $\\frac{dE}{dx}$ is $g(x)$, which is negative for $x \\in (0, 0.80]$, and the denominator $(\\ln(1-x))^2$ is positive, the derivative $\\frac{dE}{dx}$ is strictly negative on this interval. This proves that $E(y_{A,s})$ is a monotonically decreasing function on $[0, 0.80]$.\n\nLet's evaluate $E(y_{A,s})$ at the start of the interval. Using L'Hôpital's rule for the first term as $y_{A,s} \\to 0$:\n$$\n\\lim_{y_{A,s}\\to 0} \\frac{-y_{A,s}}{\\ln(1 - y_{A,s})} = \\lim_{y_{A,s}\\to 0} \\frac{-1}{-1/(1 - y_{A,s})} = \\lim_{y_{A,s}\\to 0} (1 - y_{A,s}) = 1\n$$\nSo, $E(0) = 1 - 1 = 0$.\nSince $E(y_{A,s})$ starts at $0$ and is strictly decreasing, the function $E(y_{A,s})$ is negative for all $y_{A,s} \\in (0, 0.80]$. Therefore, maximizing its magnitude $|E(y_{A,s})|$ is equivalent to minimizing the function $E(y_{A,s})$ itself.\n\nFor a monotonically decreasing function on a closed interval, the minimum value occurs at the rightmost point. Thus, the magnitude $|E(y_{A,s})|$ is maximized at the upper bound of the given range, which is $y_{A,s} = 0.80$.\n\nWe now calculate the value of this maximum magnitude:\n$$\n|E(0.80)| = \\left| \\frac{-0.80}{\\ln(1 - 0.80)} - 1 \\right| = \\left| \\frac{-0.80}{\\ln(0.20)} - 1 \\right|\n$$\nNumerically, $\\ln(0.20) \\approx -1.6094379$.\n$$\n|E(0.80)| = \\left| \\frac{-0.80}{-1.6094379} - 1 \\right| = |0.49706859 - 1| = |-0.50293141| = 0.50293141\n$$\nRounding to four significant figures, the maximum magnitude of the relative error is $0.5029$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{0.5029}\n$$", "id": "2476683"}]}
