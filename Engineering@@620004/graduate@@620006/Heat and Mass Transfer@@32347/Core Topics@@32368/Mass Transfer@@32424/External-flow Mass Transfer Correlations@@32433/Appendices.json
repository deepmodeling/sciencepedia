Therefore, a solution will be rendered.\n\nThe problem requires a three-part analysis: first, to establish the functional form of the average Sherwood number for laminar flow over a flat plate; second, to compute the average mass transfer coefficient using this relationship; and third, to validate the initial assumption of laminar flow.\n\nPart 1: Derivation of the Sherwood Number Correlation\n\nThe analysis begins with the concept of boundary layers. For an external flow over a flat plate, a momentum boundary layer develops, with its local thickness, $\\delta(x)$, at a distance $x$ from the leading edge, scaling with the local Reynolds number, $\\mathrm{Re}_{x} \\equiv U_{\\infty} x/\\nu$. For a laminar boundary layer, the exact similarity solution (Blasius solution) shows that the boundary layer thickness scales as:\n$$\n\\frac{\\delta(x)}{x} \\propto \\mathrm{Re}_{x}^{-1/2}\n$$\nSimultaneously, a concentration boundary layer develops, with a local thickness $\\delta_{c}(x)$. The ratio of the momentum and concentration boundary layer thicknesses is related by the Schmidt number, $\\mathrm{Sc} \\equiv \\nu/D_{AB}$. The similarity solution for the species transport equation, analogous to the momentum equation, yields the relationship:\n$$\n\\frac{\\delta(x)}{\\delta_{c}(x)} \\approx \\mathrm{Sc}^{1/3}\n$$\nThis approximation is valid for $\\mathrm{Sc} \\gtrsim 0.6$.\n\nThe local convective mass transfer coefficient, $k_{c,x}$, is defined by Fick's law applied at the surface ($y=0$):\n$$\nN''_{A,s} = -\\left. D_{AB} \\frac{\\partial c_{A}}{\\partial y} \\right|_{y=0} \\equiv k_{c,x}(c_{A,s} - c_{A,\\infty})\n$$\nwhere $c_{A,s}$ is the concentration of species $A$ at the surface and $c_{A,\\infty}$ is the free-stream concentration. The concentration gradient at the surface can be approximated by the overall concentration difference divided by the concentration boundary layer thickness:\n$$\n\\left. \\frac{\\partial c_{A}}{\\partial y} \\right|_{y=0} \\sim \\frac{c_{A,s} - c_{A,\\infty}}{\\delta_{c}(x)}\n$$\nFrom this, it follows that the local mass transfer coefficient scales as:\n$$\nk_{c,x} \\sim \\frac{D_{AB}}{\\delta_{c}(x)}\n$$\nSubstituting the relationships for $\\delta_{c}(x)$ and $\\delta(x)$:\n$$\nk_{c,x} \\sim \\frac{D_{AB} \\mathrm{Sc}^{1/3}}{\\delta(x)} \\sim \\frac{D_{AB} \\mathrm{Sc}^{1/3}}{x \\mathrm{Re}_{x}^{-1/2}} = \\frac{D_{AB}}{x} \\mathrm{Re}_{x}^{1/2} \\mathrm{Sc}^{1/3}\n$$\nThe local Sherwood number, $\\mathrm{Sh}_{x}$, is a dimensionless mass transfer coefficient defined as $\\mathrm{Sh}_{x} \\equiv k_{c,x} x / D_{AB}$. Using the scaling for $k_{c,x}$:\n$$\n\\mathrm{Sh}_{x} \\propto \\left( \\frac{D_{AB}}{x} \\mathrm{Re}_{x}^{1/2} \\mathrm{Sc}^{1/3} \\right) \\frac{x}{D_{AB}} = \\mathrm{Re}_{x}^{1/2} \\mathrm{Sc}^{1/3}\n$$\nThe exact similarity solution for a laminar flat plate boundary layer yields the constant of proportionality:\n$$\n\\mathrm{Sh}_{x} = 0.332 \\mathrm{Re}_{x}^{1/2} \\mathrm{Sc}^{1/3}\n$$\nTo find the average mass transfer coefficient, $\\bar{k}_{c}$, over the plate of length $L$, we integrate the local coefficient:\n$$\n\\bar{k}_{c} = \\frac{1}{L} \\int_{0}^{L} k_{c,x} \\,dx\n$$\nSince $k_{c,x} \\propto \\mathrm{Re}_{x}^{1/2} \\propto (x/\\nu)^{1/2} \\propto x^{-1/2}$, the integral is:\n$$\n\\bar{k}_{c} \\propto \\frac{1}{L} \\int_{0}^{L} x^{-1/2} \\,dx = \\frac{1}{L} \\left[ 2x^{1/2} \\right]_{0}^{L} = \\frac{2L^{1/2}}{L} \\propto L^{-1/2}\n$$\nThis shows that $\\bar{k}_{c}$ is proportional to the local coefficient at $x=L$, specifically $\\bar{k}_{c} = 2 k_{c,L}$. The average Sherwood number, $\\mathrm{Sh}_{L} \\equiv \\bar{k}_{c} L/D_{AB}$, is then:\n$$\n\\mathrm{Sh}_{L} = \\frac{(2k_{c,L})L}{D_{AB}} = 2 \\left( \\frac{k_{c,L}L}{D_{AB}} \\right) = 2 \\mathrm{Sh}_{L, \\text{local}} = 2(0.332 \\mathrm{Re}_{L}^{1/2} \\mathrm{Sc}^{1/3})\n$$\n$$\n\\mathrm{Sh}_{L} = 0.664 \\mathrm{Re}_{L}^{1/2} \\mathrm{Sc}^{1/3}\n$$\nThis establishes the required dependence: the average Sherwood number for laminar flow over a flat plate scales with $\\mathrm{Re}_{L}^{1/2}$ and $\\mathrm{Sc}^{1/3}$.\n\nPart 2: Calculation of the Average Mass Transfer Coefficient\n\nFirst, we calculate the required dimensionless numbers from the given data:\nKinematic viscosity $\\nu = 1.5 \\times 10^{-5}\\,\\mathrm{m^{2}/s}$.\nBinary diffusivity $D_{AB} = 2.0 \\times 10^{-5}\\,\\mathrm{m^{2}/s}$.\nFree-stream velocity $U_{\\infty} = 2.0\\,\\mathrm{m/s}$.\nPlate length $L = 0.30\\,\\mathrm{m}$.\n\nThe Schmidt number is:\n$$\n\\mathrm{Sc} = \\frac{\\nu}{D_{AB}} = \\frac{1.5 \\times 10^{-5}\\,\\mathrm{m^{2}/s}}{2.0 \\times 10^{-5}\\,\\mathrm{m^{2}/s}} = 0.75\n$$\nThe plate Reynolds number is:\n$$\n\\mathrm{Re}_{L} = \\frac{U_{\\infty} L}{\\nu} = \\frac{(2.0\\,\\mathrm{m/s})(0.30\\,\\mathrm{m})}{1.5 \\times 10^{-5}\\,\\mathrm{m^{2}/s}} = \\frac{0.60}{1.5 \\times 10^{-5}} = 40000 = 4.0 \\times 10^{4}\n$$\nNow, we compute the average Sherwood number using the correlation derived in Part 1:\n$$\n\\mathrm{Sh}_{L} = 0.664 \\mathrm{Re}_{L}^{1/2} \\mathrm{Sc}^{1/3} = 0.664 (4.0 \\times 10^{4})^{1/2} (0.75)^{1/3}\n$$\n$$\n\\mathrm{Sh}_{L} = 0.664 (200) (0.90856...) \\approx 120.66\n$$\nFrom the definition of the Sherwood number, we can solve for the average mass transfer coefficient $\\bar{k}_{c}$:\n$$\n\\bar{k}_{c} = \\frac{\\mathrm{Sh}_{L} D_{AB}}{L} = \\frac{(120.66)(2.0 \\times 10^{-5}\\,\\mathrm{m^{2}/s})}{0.30\\,\\mathrm{m}}\n$$\n$$\n\\bar{k}_{c} \\approx 0.008044\\,\\mathrm{m/s}\n$$\n\nPart 3: Validation of the Laminar Flow Assumption\n\nThe canonical critical Reynolds number for the onset of transition to turbulence for flow over a smooth flat plate is $\\mathrm{Re}_{x,c} \\approx 5 \\times 10^{5}$.

The problem is free of contradictions, ambiguities, and logical flaws.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. A solution will be provided.\n\nThe first task is to justify the functional form of the mass transfer correlation. We begin with the fundamental dimensionless groups governing this phenomenon.\nThe mass transfer coefficient, $k_c$, depends on fluid velocity $V$, cylinder diameter $D$, fluid density $\\rho$, fluid dynamic viscosity $\\mu$, and mass diffusivity $D_{AB}$. A dimensional analysis of these variables, $k_c = f(V, D, \\rho, \\mu, D_{AB})$, yields a relationship between dimensionless groups. These are:\n1.  The Sherwood number, $Sh$, which is the ratio of convective to diffusive mass transport:\n    $$Sh = \\frac{k_c D}{D_{AB}}$$\n2.  The Reynolds number, $Re$, which is the ratio of inertial forces to viscous forces:\n    $$Re = \\frac{\\rho V D}{\\mu} = \\frac{V D}{\\nu}$$\n    where $\\nu = \\mu/\\rho$ is the kinematic viscosity.\n3.  The Schmidt number, $Sc$, which is the ratio of momentum diffusivity to mass diffusivity:\n    $$Sc = \\frac{\\nu}{D_{AB}}$$\nThus, the relationship can be expressed in dimensionless form as $Sh = \\phi(Re, Sc)$.\n\nThe explicit functional form is typically determined empirically. However, a strong theoretical argument for its structure can be made by invoking the Chilton–Colburn analogy, which relates heat, mass, and momentum transfer. For external flow over various geometries, the analogy states:\n$$j_H = j_D = \\frac{C_f}{2}$$\nwhere $j_H$ is the Colburn $j$-factor for heat transfer, $j_D$ is the Colburn $j$-factor for mass transfer, and $C_f$ is the Fanning friction factor. The definitions are:\n$$j_H = \\frac{Nu}{Re Pr^{1/3}} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad j_D = \\frac{Sh}{Re Sc^{1/3}}$$\nHere, $Nu$ is the Nusselt number and $Pr$ is the Prandtl number. The analogy implies a direct relationship between heat and mass transfer correlations:\n$$\\frac{Nu}{Re Pr^{1/3}} = \\frac{Sh}{Re Sc^{1/3}} \\implies Sh = Nu \\left(\\frac{Sc}{Pr}\\right)^{1/3}$$\n\nThe Hilpert correlation for heat transfer over a cylinder in crossflow is an empirical correlation of the form:\n$$Nu = C Re^m Pr^{1/3}$$\nThe coefficients $C$ and $m$ are dependent on the Reynolds number. Substituting this form into the analogy relationship, we arrive at the corresponding mass transfer correlation:\n$$Sh = (C Re^m Pr^{1/3}) \\left(\\frac{Sc}{Pr}\\right)^{1/3} = C Re^m (Pr^{1/3} \\frac{Sc^{1/3}}{Pr^{1/3}}) = C Re^m Sc^{1/3}$$\nThis justifies the general functional form $Sh = C Re^m Sc^{n}$ where the exponent $n$ is taken to be $1/3$. This dependence on $Sc^{1/3}$ is robust and emerges from boundary layer theory, proving effective for a wide range of forced convection problems. The problem supplies the empirical coefficients $C$ and $m$ for the given flow regime.\n\nThe second task is to compute the Sherwood number, $Sh$, and the mass transfer coefficient, $k_c$. The applicable correlation is:\n$$Sh = C Re^m Sc^{1/3}$$\nWe are given $C = 0.193$, $m = 0.618$, $Re = 1.0 \\times 10^4$, and $Sc = 0.70$.
