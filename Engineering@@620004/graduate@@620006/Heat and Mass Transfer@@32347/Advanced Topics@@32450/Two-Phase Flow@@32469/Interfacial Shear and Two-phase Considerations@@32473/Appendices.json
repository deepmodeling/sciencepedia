The continuous phase has density $\\rho$, dynamic viscosity $\\mu$, and a constant interfacial tension $\\gamma$ with the dispersed phase. The characteristic mean velocity of the plug is $U$. Gravitational and compressibility effects are negligible, and the interfacial tension is spatially uniform (no Marangoni stresses). The interface curvature scale is $O(1/L)$.\n\nStarting from the continuum momentum balance and the interfacial normal-stress jump (Laplace) condition together with appropriate stress scalings, construct the dimensionless groups that compare the magnitudes of viscous and inertial stresses to capillary stresses at the interface.

We proceed with the derivation and calculation.\n\nThe problem requires us to construct dimensionless groups that compare viscous and inertial stresses to capillary stresses. This is achieved through scaling analysis of the governing equations of fluid dynamics.\n\nThe momentum balance for the continuous phase, an incompressible Newtonian fluid with negligible gravity, is given by the Navier-Stokes equation:\n$$\n\\rho \\left( \\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{u}}{\\partial t} + (\\mathbf{u} \\cdot \\nabla)\\mathbf{u} \\right) = -\\nabla p + \\nabla \\cdot \\boldsymbol{\\tau}\n$$\nwhere $\\rho$ is the density, $\\mathbf{u}$ is the velocity field, $p$ is the pressure, and $\\boldsymbol{\\tau}$ is the viscous stress tensor, $\\boldsymbol{\\tau} = \\mu (\\nabla \\mathbf{u} + (\\nabla \\mathbf{u})^T)$. For steady flow, $\\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{u}}{\\partial t} = 0$. The term $\\rho (\\mathbf{u} \\cdot \\nabla)\\mathbf{u}$ represents the advection of momentum, whose magnitude gives the characteristic inertial stress.\n\nAt the interface between the two immiscible fluids, the normal stress components are discontinuous. This jump is balanced by the product of the interfacial tension, $\\gamma$, and the total interface curvature, $\\kappa = \\nabla_s \\cdot \\mathbf{n}$, where $\\mathbf{n}$ is the unit normal to the interface and $\\nabla_s$ is the surface gradient operator. The condition, known as the Young-Laplace equation, is:\n$$\n\\mathbf{n} \\cdot (\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}_1 - \\boldsymbol{\\sigma}_2) \\cdot \\mathbf{n} = \\gamma \\kappa\n$$\nHere, $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma} = -p\\mathbf{I} + \\boldsymbol{\\tau}$ is the total stress tensor. This equation provides the characteristic scale for capillary effects.\n\nWe will now determine the characteristic magnitudes of the relevant stresses using the scales provided: characteristic velocity $U$ and characteristic length (hydraulic diameter) $L$.\n\n1.  **Inertial Stress Scaling ($S_{inertial}$):**\n    The inertial stress arises from momentum flux, $\\rho u_i u_j$. Its characteristic magnitude scales as:\n    $$\n    S_{inertial} \\sim \\rho U^2\n    $$\n\n2.  **Viscous Stress Scaling ($S_{viscous}$):**\n    The viscous stress for a Newtonian fluid is $\\tau_{ij} = \\mu (\\frac{\\partial u_i}{\\partial x_j} + \\frac{\\partial u_j}{\\partial x_i})$. The velocity gradients, $\\frac{\\partial u_i}{\\partial x_j}$, scale as $U/L$. Thus, the characteristic viscous stress is:\n    $$\n    S_{viscous} \\sim \\mu \\frac{U}{L}\n    $$\n\n3.  **Capillary Stress Scaling ($S_{capillary}$):**\n    The capillary stress (or pressure) is derived from the interfacial tension term in the normal stress balance, $\\gamma \\kappa$. The problem states that the interface curvature scale is $O(1/L)$, so $\\kappa \\sim 1/L$. The characteristic capillary stress is therefore:\n    $$\n    S_{capillary} \\sim \\frac{\\gamma}{L}\n    $$\n\nWith these characteristic scales, we construct the required dimensionless groups.\n\nThe first group compares viscous stress to capillary stress. This is the Capillary number, $Ca$:\n$$\nCa = \\frac{S_{viscous}}{S_{capillary}} = \\frac{\\mu U / L}{\\gamma / L} = \\frac{\\mu U}{\\gamma}\n$$\nThe Capillary number represents the relative importance of viscous forces versus interfacial tension forces acting across the interface.\n\nThe second group compares inertial stress to capillary stress.

The problem specifies that the tangential viscous shear stress is continuous across the interface at $y=h_1$, which is consistent with our finding that $\\tau$ is constant everywhere. The interfacial shear stress, $\\tau_i$, is therefore equal to this constant, $\\tau_i = \\tau$.\n\nThe fluids are Newtonian, so the shear stress is related to the velocity gradient by the constitutive relation:\n$$ \\tau_{yx} = \\mu \\frac{du}{dy} $$\nWe apply this relation to each fluid layer.

The objective function $E$ is therefore:\n$$\nE(\\mathbf{p}) = \\sum_{i=1}^{N}\\Bigl[\\ln \\tau_i^{\\mathrm{model}}(\\mathbf{p}) - \\ln \\tau_{i}^{\\mathrm{meas}}\\Bigr]^2\n$$\nTaking the natural logarithm of the model expression for $\\tau_i^{\\mathrm{model}}$ yields:\n$$\n\\ln \\tau_i^{\\mathrm{model}} = \\ln\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\,\\rho_g\\,U_{\\mathrm{rel}}^2\\right) + \\ln C + a\\ln(\\mathrm{Re}_g) + b\\ln(\\mathrm{Re}_l) + c\\ln(M) + \\ln(1 + kS^2)\n$$\nThis transformation reveals the structure of the regression problem. While the parameters $a$, $b$, and $c$ appear linearly, as does $\\ln C$, the parameter $k$ is embedded within a logarithmic function, $\\ln(1+kS^2)$, rendering the overall problem non-linear. Consequently, a numerical non-linear optimization routine is required.\n\nThe solution is implemented using the `scipy.optimize.least_squares` function, a robust tool for solving non-linear least-squares problems. This function attempts to minimize the sum of squares of a vector of residuals. We define the residual for each data point $i$ as\n$$\nr_i(\\mathbf{p}) = \\ln \\tau_i^{\\mathrm{model}}(\\mathbf{p}) - \\ln \\tau_i^{\\mathrm{meas}}\n$$\nThe optimization is performed subject to the specified bounds on the parameters: $C \\in [10^{-6}, 1]$, $a \\in [-1, 1]$, $b \\in [-1, 1]$, $c \\in [-1, 1]$, and $k \\in [0, 10^3]$. The 'Trust Region Reflective' (`trf`) algorithm is employed as it is well-suited for bound-constrained optimization.\n\nThe procedure is as follows:\n1.  Define a function to compute the vector of residuals $r_i$ for a given parameter vector $\\mathbf{p}$. This function takes the $8$ calibration cases, calculates the necessary dimensionless numbers for each, evaluates $\\tau_i^{\\mathrm{model}}$, and computes the logarithmic residual against $\\tau_i^{\\mathrm{meas}}$.\n2.  Provide an initial guess for the parameter vector $\\mathbf{p}_0$ and the defined parameter bounds to the `least_squares` optimizer.\n3.  The optimizer iteratively adjusts $\\mathbf{p}$ to find the optimal vector $\\mathbf{p}^*$ that minimizes $\\sum r_i^2$.\n4.  Once the calibrated parameters $\\mathbf{p}^* = [C^*, a^*, b^*, c^*, k^*]$ are obtained, they are used to predict the interfacial shear stress for the three separate test cases (Test A, B, C) by applying the model equation directly.\n5.
