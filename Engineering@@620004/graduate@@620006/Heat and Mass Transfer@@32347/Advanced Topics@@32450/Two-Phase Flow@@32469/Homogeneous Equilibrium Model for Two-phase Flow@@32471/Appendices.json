To solve this, we must determine the mixture density $\\rho_m$ as a function of position $z$.\n\nIn the Homogeneous Equilibrium Model (HEM), both phases are assumed to travel at the same velocity.

Express any intermediate physical quantities with appropriate SI units if needed, but only the final answer should be unitless.", "solution": "The problem statement has been critically evaluated and is deemed valid. It is scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and internally consistent. It presents a standard problem in two-phase flow and heat transfer analysis, providing all necessary physical properties and conditions for a unique solution. The data for steam and water are physically accurate for the specified conditions. The instructions are clear and lead to a verifiable result. I will proceed with the solution.\n\nThe problem requires a four-part analysis to evaluate the applicability of the Homogeneous Equilibrium Model (HEM) by comparing characteristic interphase relaxation times to the hydrodynamic residence time of a particle-laden flow.\n\n1) Derivation of the momentum relaxation time scale, $\\tau_{m}$.\nWe consider a spherical droplet of diameter $d$ and density $\\rho_{p}$ moving in a gas of viscosity $\\mu_{g}$. Newton's second law for the droplet is given by:\n$$\nm_{p} \\frac{d\\vec{u}_{p}}{dt} = \\vec{F}_{D}\n$$\nwhere $m_{p}$ is the droplet mass, $\\vec{u}_{p}$ is the droplet velocity, and $\\vec{F}_{D}$ is the drag force exerted by the gas. The droplet mass is $m_{p} = \\rho_{p} V_{p} = \\rho_{p} \\frac{\\pi d^{3}}{6}$.\n\nUnder creeping-flow conditions ($\\mathrm{Re} \\ll 1$), the drag force is given by Stokes' law:\n$$\n\\vec{F}_{D} = 3\\pi\\mu_{g}d(\\vec{u}_{g} - \\vec{u}_{p})\n$$\nwhere $\\vec{u}_{g}$ is the gas velocity. Let the relative velocity be $\\vec{w} = \\vec{u}_{p} - \\vec{u}_{g}$. Assuming the background gas velocity $\\vec{u}_{g}$ is constant, we have $\\frac{d\\vec{w}}{dt} = \\frac{d\\vec{u}_{p}}{dt}$. Newton's second law becomes:\n$$\nm_{p} \\frac{d\\vec{w}}{dt} = -3\\pi\\mu_{g}d \\vec{w}\n$$\nRearranging this into the standard form of a first-order linear ordinary differential equation, we get:\n$$\n\\frac{d\\vec{w}}{dt} = -\\left(\\frac{3\\pi\\mu_{g}d}{m_{p}}\\right) \\vec{w}\n$$\nThis equation describes the exponential decay of the relative velocity with a characteristic time scale, which we identify as the momentum relaxation time $\\tau_{m}$:\n$$\n\\tau_{m} = \\frac{m_{p}}{3\\pi\\mu_{g}d}\n$$\nSubstituting the expression for the droplet mass, we obtain $\\tau_{m}$ in terms of the required parameters:\n$$\n\\tau_{m} = \\frac{\\rho_{p} \\frac{\\pi d^{3}}{6}}{3\\pi\\mu_{g}d} = \\frac{\\rho_{p} d^{2}}{18\\mu_{g}}\n$$\n\n2) Derivation of the thermal relaxation time scale, $\\tau_{T}$.\nWe apply an energy balance to the droplet. Under the small-Biot-number (lumped-capacitance) assumption, the temperature distribution within the droplet is uniform, $T_{p}(t)$. The rate of change of the droplet's internal energy is balanced by the convective heat transfer from the surrounding gas at temperature $T_{g}$:\n$$\nm_{p} c_{p,p} \\frac{dT_{p}}{dt} = h A_{s} (T_{g} - T_{p})\n$$\nHere, $c_{p,p}$ is the droplet's specific heat, $h$ is the convective heat transfer coefficient, and $A_{s} = \\pi d^{2}$ is the droplet surface area. Let the temperature difference be $\\Delta T = T_{p} - T_{g}$. Assuming $T_g$ is constant, we have $\\frac{d(\\Delta T)}{dt} = \\frac{dT_{p}}{dt}$. The energy balance becomes:\n$$\nm_{p} c_{p,p} \\frac{d(\\Delta T)}{dt} = -h A_{s} \\Delta T\n$$\nThis is another first-order linear ODE, from which we identify the thermal relaxation time $\\tau_{T}$:\n$$\n\\tau_{T} = \\frac{m_{p} c_{p,p}}{h A_{s}}\n$$\nSubstituting the expressions for $m_{p}$ and $A_{s}$:\n$$\n\\tau_{T} = \\frac{\\left(\\rho_{p} \\frac{\\pi d^{3}}{6}\\right) c_{p,p}}{h (\\pi d^{2})} = \\frac{\\rho_{p} c_{p,p} d}{6h}\n$$\nThe heat transfer coefficient $h$ is related to the Nusselt number $\\mathrm{Nu}$ via the definition $\\mathrm{Nu} = \\frac{hd}{k_{g}}$, where $k_{g}$ is the thermal conductivity of the gas. Thus, $h = \\frac{\\mathrm{Nu} k_{g}}{d}$. Substituting this into the expression for $\\tau_{T}$ gives the final form:\n$$\n\\tau_{T} = \\frac{\\rho_{p} c_{p,p} d}{6 \\left(\\frac{\\mathrm{Nu} k_{g}}{d}\\right)} = \\frac{\\rho_{p} c_{p,p} d^{2}}{6 \\mathrm{Nu} k_{g}}\n$$\n\n3) Numerical evaluation and validation of assumptions.\nThe given data are:\n$\\rho_{g} = 0.60\\ \\mathrm{kg\\,m^{-3}}$, $\\mu_{g} = 1.20 \\times 10^{-5}\\ \\mathrm{Pa\\,s}$, $k_{g} = 0.025\\ \\mathrm{W\\,m^{-1}\\,K^{-1}}$, $\\mathrm{Pr}_{g} = 1.0$.\n$\\rho_{p} = 958\\ \\mathrm{kg\\,m^{-3}}$, $c_{p,p} = 4.20 \\times 10^{3}\\ \\mathrm{J\\,kg^{-1}\\,K^{-1}}$, $k_{l} = 0.68\\ \\mathrm{W\\,m^{-1}\\,K^{-1}}$, $d = 50\\ \\mu\\mathrm{m} = 5.0 \\times 10^{-5}\\ \\mathrm{m}$.\n$U = 0.50\\ \\mathrm{m\\,s^{-1}}$, $L = 2.0\\ \\mathrm{m}$.\n\nFirst, we verify the creeping flow assumption by calculating the droplet Reynolds number, $\\mathrm{Re}$. As instructed, we estimate the relative velocity as $U_{rel} \\approx U$.\n$$\n\\mathrm{Re} = \\frac{\\rho_{g} U d}{\\mu_{g}} = \\frac{(0.60\\ \\mathrm{kg\\,m^{-3}})(0.50\\ \\mathrm{m\\,s^{-1}})(5.0 \\times 10^{-5}\\ \\mathrm{m})}{1.20 \\times 10^{-5}\\ \\mathrm{Pa\\,s}} = 1.25\n$$\nThe Stokes flow regime is strictly valid for $\\mathrm{Re} \\ll 1$. A value of $\\mathrm{Re} = 1.25$ indicates that the flow is at the upper limit of the Stokes regime, and inertial effects are becoming non-negligible. The assumption is thus only marginally satisfied. However, we proceed with the derived formula as per the problem's instructions.\n\nNow, we calculate $\\tau_{m}$:\n$$\n\\tau_{m} = \\frac{\\rho_{p} d^{2}}{18\\mu_{g}} = \\frac{(958\\ \\mathrm{kg\\,m^{-3}})(5.0 \\times 10^{-5}\\ \\mathrm{m})^{2}}{18(1.20 \\times 10^{-5}\\ \\mathrm{Pa\\,s})} \\approx 0.01109\\ \\mathrm{s}\n$$\n\nNext, we calculate $\\tau_{T}$. This requires the Nusselt number, $\\mathrm{Nu}$. We use the Ranz-Marshall correlation, which is appropriate for spheres in this $\\mathrm{Re}$ range:\n$$\n\\mathrm{Nu} = 2.0 + 0.6 \\mathrm{Re}^{1/2} \\mathrm{Pr}_{g}^{1/3}\n$$\nSubstituting $\\mathrm{Re} = 1.25$ and $\\mathrm{Pr}_{g} = 1.0$:\n$$\n\\mathrm{Nu} = 2.0 + 0.6 (1.25)^{1/2} (1.0)^{1/3} \\approx 2.0 + 0.6 (1.11803) \\approx 2.6708\n$$\n\nWith $\\mathrm{Nu}$, we can calculate $\\tau_{T}$:\n$$\n\\tau_{T} = \\frac{\\rho_{p} c_{p,p} d^{2}}{6 \\mathrm{Nu} k_{g}} = \\frac{(958\\ \\mathrm{kg\\,m^{-3}})(4.20 \\times 10^{3}\\ \\mathrm{J\\,kg^{-1}\\,K^{-1}})(5.0 \\times 10^{-5}\\ \\mathrm{m})^{2}}{6(2.6708)(0.025\\ \\mathrm{W\\,m^{-1}\\,K^{-1}})} \\approx 0.02511\\ \\mathrm{s}\n$$\n\nNow, we verify the small-Biot-number assumption. The Biot number, $\\mathrm{Bi}$, is given by $\\mathrm{Bi} = \\frac{hL_{c}}{k_{l}}$, where $L_c$ is the characteristic length of the droplet and $k_l$ is its thermal conductivity. For a sphere, $L_{c} = V_{p}/A_{s} = d/6$.\nFirst, calculate the heat transfer coefficient $h$:\n$$\nh = \\frac{\\mathrm{Nu} k_{g}}{d} = \\frac{(2.6708)(0.025\\ \\mathrm{W\\,m^{-1}\\,K^{-1}})}{5.0 \\times 10^{-5}\\ \\mathrm{m}} \\approx 1335.4\\ \\mathrm{W\\,m^{-2}\\,K^{-1}}\n$$\nNow, calculate the Biot number:\n$$\n\\mathrm{Bi} = \\frac{h (d/6)}{k_{l}} = \\frac{(1335.4\\ \\mathrm{W\\,m^{-2}\\,K^{-1}})(5.0 \\times 10^{-5}\\ \\mathrm{m} / 6)}{0.68\\ \\mathrm{W\\,m^{-1}\\,K^{-1}}} \\approx 0.016\n$$\nSince $\\mathrm{Bi} \\approx 0.016 \\ll 0.1$, the internal thermal resistance of the droplet is negligible compared to the external convective resistance. The lumped-capacitance assumption is therefore valid.\n\n4) Computation of the equilibrium parameter $\\varepsilon$.\nThe hydrodynamic residence time, $t_{h}$, is the time taken for the bulk flow to travel the length $L$ of the pipe section:\n$$\nt_{h} = \\frac{L}{U} = \\frac{2.0\\ \\mathrm{m}}{0.50\\ \\mathrm{m\\,s^{-1}}} = 4.0\\ \\mathrm{s}\n$$\nThe equilibrium parameter $\\varepsilon$ is defined as the ratio of the longer relaxation time to the residence time. Comparing the two relaxation times:\n$\\tau_{m} \\approx 0.0111\\ \\mathrm{s}$\n$\\tau_{T} \\approx 0.0251\\ \\mathrm{s}$\nThe thermal relaxation time is longer. Therefore, $\\max(\\tau_{m}, \\tau_{T}) = \\tau_{T}$.\nWe can now calculate $\\varepsilon$:\n$$\n\\varepsilon = \\frac{\\max\\!\\left(\\tau_{m},\\,\\tau_{T}\\right)}{t_{h}} = \\frac{\\tau_{T}}{t_{h}} = \\frac{0.02511\\ \\mathrm{s}}{4.0\\ \\mathrm{s}} \\approx 0.0062775\n$$\nRounding to three significant figures, we get $\\varepsilon \\approx 0.00628$. This small value of $\\varepsilon$ indicates that both momentum and thermal relaxation occur much faster than the time the droplet spends in the pipe section, suggesting that the Homogeneous Equilibrium Model is a reasonable approximation for this specific flow scenario.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{0.00628}\n$$", "id": "2495003"}]}
