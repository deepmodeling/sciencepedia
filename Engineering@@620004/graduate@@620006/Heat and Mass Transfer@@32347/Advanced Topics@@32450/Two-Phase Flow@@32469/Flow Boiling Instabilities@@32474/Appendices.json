It represents a standard problem in the analysis of two-phase flow instabilities. We may therefore proceed with a complete solution.\n\nThe problem requires the determination of the static stability of an operating point in a forced-circulation loop. This is governed by the balance between the pressure head supplied by a pump, $\\Delta P_{s}(G)$, and the pressure drop across the heated channel, $\\Delta P_{c}(G)$. Both are functions of the mass flux, $G$.\n\nFirst, we must identify the steady-state operating point, denoted by $G^{\\star}$. By definition, this is the mass flux at which the pump supply pressure exactly matches the channel demand pressure. This condition is expressed by the equation:\n$$\n\\Delta P_{s}(G^{\\star}) = \\Delta P_{c}(G^{\\star})\n$$\nSubstituting the given expressions for $\\Delta P_{s}(G)$ and $\\Delta P_{c}(G)$:\n$$\n250 - 0.08 G - 1.0 \\times 10^{-4} G^{2} = 0.09 G + \\frac{4.0 \\times 10^{4}}{G+200} + 10\n$$\nTo solve for $G$, we rearrange the equation.

By inspection or numerical methods, we test for simple roots. Let us test $G=800$:\n$$\n(800)^{3} + 1900(800)^{2} - 2.06 \\times 10^{6}(800) - 8.0 \\times 10^{7}\n$$\n$$\n= 5.12 \\times 10^{8} + 1900(6.4 \\times 10^{5}) - 1.648 \\times 10^{9} - 0.8 \\times 10^{8}\n$$\n$$\n= 5.12 \\times 10^{8} + 12.16 \\times 10^{8} - 16.48 \\times 10^{8} - 0.8 \\times 10^{8}\n$$\n$$\n= (5.12 + 12.16 - 16.48 - 0.8) \\times 10^{8} = (17.28 - 17.28) \\times 10^{8} = 0\n$$\nThus, $G^{\\star} = 800 \\ \\mathrm{kg\\, m^{-2}\\, s^{-1}}$ is a solution. To check for other physical solutions (i.e., $G>0$), we can perform polynomial division by $(G-800)$. The resulting quadratic equation is $G^{2} + 2700G + 100000 = 0$. The roots of this quadratic are given by $G = \\frac{-2700 \\pm \\sqrt{2700^{2} - 4(100000)}}{2}$, which both evaluate to negative, non-physical values. Therefore, the sole physically meaningful operating point is $G^{\\star} = 800 \\ \\mathrm{kg\\, m^{-2}\\, s^{-1}}$.\n\nNext, we derive the criterion for static stability from first principles. The momentum balance for the fluid in the entire loop dictates that the rate of change of fluid momentum is driven by the net pressure head available. This can be expressed as:\n$$\nK \\frac{dG}{dt} = \\Delta P_{s}(G) - \\Delta P_{c}(G)\n$$\nwhere $K$ is a positive constant representing the fluid inertia of the loop, $t$ is time. At the steady-state operating point $G^{\\star}$, $\\frac{dG}{dt}=0$, and $\\Delta P_{s}(G^{\\star}) - \\Delta P_{c}(G^{\\star}) = 0$.\n\nTo analyze stability, we consider a small perturbation $\\delta G(t)$ from the steady state, such that $G(t) = G^{\\star} + \\delta G(t)$. Substituting this into the momentum equation:\n$$\nK \\frac{d}{dt}(G^{\\star} + \\delta G(t)) = \\Delta P_{s}(G^{\\star} + \\delta G) - \\Delta P_{c}(G^{\\star} + \\delta G)\n$$\nSince $G^{\\star}$ is a constant, $\\frac{dG^{\\star}}{dt}=0$. We linearize the pressure terms on the right-hand side using a Taylor series expansion around $G^{\\star}$ and retaining only the first-order terms:\n$$\n\\Delta P_{s}(G^{\\star} + \\delta G) \\approx \\Delta P_{s}(G^{\\star}) + \\left.\\frac{d\\Delta P_{s}}{dG}\\right|_{G^{\\star}} \\delta G\n$$\n$$\n\\Delta P_{c}(G^{\\star} + \\delta G) \\approx \\Delta P_{c}(G^{\\star}) + \\left.\\frac{d\\Delta P_{c}}{dG}\\right|_{G^{\\star}} \\delta G\n$$\nSubstituting these approximations into the momentum equation gives:\n$$\nK \\frac{d(\\delta G)}{dt} \\approx \\left( \\Delta P_{s}(G^{\\star}) + \\left.\\frac{d\\Delta P_{s}}{dG}\\right|_{G^{\\star}} \\delta G \\right) - \\left( \\Delta P_{c}(G^{\\star}) + \\left.\\frac{d\\Delta P_{c}}{dG}\\right|_{G^{\\star}} \\delta G \\right)\n$$\nUsing the steady-state condition $\\Delta P_{s}(G^{\\star}) = \\Delta P_{c}(G^{\\star})$, the equation simplifies to:\n$$\nK \\frac{d(\\delta G)}{dt} = \\left( \\left.\\frac{d\\Delta P_{s}}{dG}\\right|_{G^{\\star}} - \\left.\\frac{d\\Delta P_{c}}{dG}\\right|_{G^{\\star}} \\right) \\delta G\n$$\nThis is a first-order linear ordinary differential equation for the perturbation $\\delta G$. The general solution is $\\delta G(t) = \\delta G(0) \\exp(\\lambda t)$, where the exponent $\\lambda$ is given by:\n$$\n\\lambda = \\frac{1}{K} \\left( \\left.\\frac{d\\Delta P_{s}}{dG}\\right|_{G^{\\star}} - \\left.\\frac{d\\Delta P_{c}}{dG}\\right|_{G^{\\star}} \\right)\n$$\nFor the operating point to be stable, any small perturbation must decay over time, meaning $\\lim_{t \\to \\infty} \\delta G(t) = 0$. This requires $\\lambda  0$. Since $K  0$, the condition for static stability (Ledinegg criterion) is:\n$$\n\\left.\\frac{d\\Delta P_{s}}{dG}\\right|_{G^{\\star}} - \\left.\\frac{d\\Delta P_{c}}{dG}\\right|_{G^{\\star}}  0 \\quad \\implies \\quad \\left.\\frac{d\\Delta P_{c}}{dG}\\right|_{G^{\\star}}  \\left.\\frac{d\\Delta P_{s}}{dG}\\right|_{G^{\\star}}\n$$\nThis means that for a stable operating point, the slope of the channel pressure drop curve must be greater than the slope of the pump head curve.\n\nThe problem defines the local stability margin as $S_{\\text{local}} = \\left.\\frac{d\\Delta P_{c}}{dG}\\right|_{G^{\\star}}-\\left.\\frac{d\\Delta P_{s}}{dG}\\right|_{G^{\\star}}$. Based on our derivation, the system is stable if and only if $S_{\\text{local}}  0$.

The mechanism relies on a time delay. A perturbation in the inlet flow rate (e.g., a momentary increase) propagates through the channel. This affects the rate of vapor generation and thus the local and average mixture density. The total pressure drop across the channel is a sum of frictional, gravitational, and accelerational components, all of which depend on the density distribution. The change in total pressure drop then provides feedback to the inlet, potentially modifying the inlet flow rate.\nFor an oscillation to be sustained, the feedback must be properly phased. The time it takes for a perturbation to travel through the channel and affect the overall pressure drop is the characteristic delay time of the system. This delay is precisely the fluid transit time, $\\tau$. The fundamental period of an oscillation in a system with a time delay is typically on the order of the delay itself. Therefore, the dominant frequency, $f$, is expected to scale as the inverse of the transit time, $f \\propto 1/\\tau$. A more detailed linear stability analysis shows the characteristic frequency is typically close to $1/(2\\tau)$, but the scaling $f \\sim 1/\\tau$ captures the fundamental physics of the phenomenon, where the transport lag of the density wave dictates the oscillation's timescale.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{234}\n$$", "id": "2487027"}, {"introduction": "To move from specific cases to general principles, engineers often use dimensionless models and formal stability analysis.

Substituting these into equations $(1)$ and $(2)$ yields a system of algebraic equations for the amplitudes. The delayed term becomes $q'(t-\\theta) = q_0 \\exp(\\lambda(t-\\theta)) = q_0 \\exp(\\lambda t) \\exp(-\\lambda\\theta)$.\n\nSubstitution into equation $(1)$:\n$$ \\lambda q_0 \\exp(\\lambda t) = -\\beta q_0 \\exp(\\lambda t) - \\kappa x_0 \\exp(\\lambda t) $$\n$$ \\implies (\\lambda + \\beta) q_0 + \\kappa x_0 = 0 \\quad (3) $$\n\nSubstitution into equation $(2)$:\n$$ \\lambda x_0 \\exp(\\lambda t) = -x_0 \\exp(\\lambda t) + s q_0 \\exp(\\lambda t) \\exp(-\\lambda\\theta) $$\n$$ \\implies -s \\exp(-\\lambda\\theta) q_0 + (\\lambda + 1) x_0 = 0 \\quad (4) $$\n\nThis is a homogeneous linear system for $(q_0, x_0)$. For a non-trivial solution to exist, the determinant of the coefficient matrix must be zero. This condition provides the characteristic equation, or dispersion relation, of the system.\n$$\n\\begin{vmatrix}\n\\lambda + \\beta  \\kappa \\\\\n-s \\exp(-\\lambda\\theta)  \\lambda + 1\n\\end{vmatrix} = 0\n$$\nExpanding the determinant gives:\n$$ (\\lambda + \\beta)(\\lambda + 1) + \\kappa s \\exp(-\\lambda\\theta) = 0 $$\nUsing the provided definition of the feedback strength, $\\Gamma \\equiv \\kappa s$, the characteristic equation is:\n$$ (\\lambda + \\beta)(\\lambda + 1) + \\Gamma \\exp(-\\lambda\\theta) = 0 \\quad (5) $$\nThe neutral stability boundary is defined as the locus of parameters where the system exhibits sustained oscillations, corresponding to purely imaginary eigenvalues $\\lambda = i\\omega$, where $\\omega$ is the real, non-zero angular frequency. Substituting $\\lambda = i\\omega$ into equation $(5)$:\n$$ (i\\omega + \\beta)(i\\omega + 1) + \\Gamma \\exp(-i\\omega\\theta) = 0 $$\nExpanding the terms:\n$$ (i\\omega)^2 + i\\omega(1 + \\beta) + \\beta + \\Gamma (\\cos(\\omega\\theta) - i\\sin(\\omega\\theta)) = 0 $$\n$$ (\\beta - \\omega^2) + i\\omega(1 + \\beta) + \\Gamma \\cos(\\omega\\theta) - i\\Gamma \\sin(\\omega\\theta) = 0 $$\nFor this complex equation to hold, both its real and imaginary parts must vanish independently.\n\nReal part:\n$$ \\beta - \\omega^2 + \\Gamma \\cos(\\omega\\theta) = 0 \\quad (6) $$\nImaginary part:\n$$ \\omega(1+\\beta) - \\Gamma \\sin(\\omega\\theta) = 0 \\quad (7) $$\nThese two equations constitute the neutral stability conditions. They relate the oscillation frequency $\\omega$ and the feedback strength $\\Gamma$ at the stability boundary.\n\nThe problem specifies a condition for the fundamental neutral mode: the delay introduces a quarter-period phase lag, which is mathematically expressed as $\\omega\\theta = \\frac{\\pi}{2}$. We apply this condition to the neutral stability equations.\n\nUnder this condition:\n$$ \\cos(\\omega\\theta) = \\cos\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\right) = 0 $$\n$$ \\sin(\\omega\\theta) = \\sin\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\right) = 1 $$\nSubstituting these values into equations $(6)$ and $(7)$, we obtain a simplified system. At the stability boundary, $\\Gamma$ takes on its critical value, $\\Gamma_{\\mathrm{crit}}$.\n\nFrom the real part, equation $(6)$:\n$$ \\beta - \\omega^2 + \\Gamma_{\\mathrm{crit}} (0) = 0 $$\n$$ \\implies \\omega^2 = \\beta $$\nSince $\\omega$ is a physical frequency and $\\beta  0$ is given, we have:\n$$ \\omega = \\sqrt{\\beta} $$\n\nFrom the imaginary part, equation $(7)$:\n$$ \\omega(1+\\beta) - \\Gamma_{\\mathrm{crit}} (1) = 0 $$\n$$ \\implies \\Gamma_{\\mathrm{crit}} = \\omega(1+\\beta) $$\nNow, we eliminate $\\omega$ by substituting its expression from the real part into the expression for $\\Gamma_{\\mathrm{crit}}$ from the imaginary part.\n$$ \\Gamma_{\\mathrm{crit}} = (\\sqrt{\\beta})(1+\\beta) $$\nThis is the closed-form analytic expression for the critical feedback strength on the neutral stability boundary, expressed solely in terms of the parameter $\\beta$, as required.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{(1+\\beta)\\sqrt{\\beta}}$$", "id": "2487045"}]}
