It requests the definition of standard parameters in two-phase flow, the derivation of a fundamental correlation from a specified physical premise, and a subsequent calculation. All necessary information is provided. We shall proceed with the solution.\n\nThe analysis is based on the separated flow model for two-phase flow, where the two phases are imagined to flow in separate, parallel channels. The frictional pressure drop is the primary focus, with other contributions being negligible as per the problem statement.\n\nFirst, we define the key parameters. The two-phase frictional pressure gradient is denoted $(dp/dz)_{f}$. The liquid-referenced two-phase frictional pressure drop multiplier, $\\phi_{l}^{2}$, is defined as the ratio of the actual two-phase frictional pressure gradient, $(dp/dz)_{f}$, to the frictional pressure gradient that would exist if the liquid phase were flowing alone in the entire pipe. This hypothetical liquid-only pressure gradient is denoted $(dp/dz)_{l}$. Thus, the definition is:\n$$ \\phi_{l}^{2} \\equiv \\frac{\\left(\\frac{dp}{dz}\\right)_{f}}{\\left(\\frac{dp}{dz}\\right)_{l}} $$\nThis parameter quantifies the enhancement of the frictional pressure drop due to the presence of the second phase (the gas).\n\nThe Martinelli parameter, $X$, is a dimensionless group that relates the frictional pressure losses of the two phases flowing alone. It is defined as the square root of the ratio of the liquid-only superficial frictional pressure gradient, $(dp/dz)_{l}$, to the gas-only superficial frictional pressure gradient, $(dp/dz)_{g}$:\n$$ X \\equiv \\sqrt{\\frac{\\left(\\frac{dp}{dz}\\right)_{l}}{\\left(\\frac{dp}{dz}\\right)_{g}}} $$\nConsequently, the square of the Martinelli parameter is $X^2 = \\frac{(dp/dz)_{l}}{(dp/dz)_{g}}$. This parameter is crucial as it characterizes the relative importance of liquid-phase and gas-phase frictional effects.\n\nNext, we must derive the expression for $\\phi_{l}^{2}$. The problem instructs to start from the physical premise of a superposition of frictional contributions with an added interaction term, a concept central to the Chisholm correlation. This premise is formally postulated as an equation for the total two-phase frictional pressure gradient:\n$$ \\left(\\frac{dp}{dz}\\right)_{f} = \\left(\\frac{dp}{dz}\\right)_{l} + \\left(\\frac{dp}{dz}\\right)_{g} + I $$\nHere, the first two terms on the right-hand side represent a simple superposition of the single-phase pressure gradients. The third term, $I$, is an interaction term that accounts for the additional momentum transfer and friction occurring at the interface between the liquid and gas phases. Chisholm proposed that this interaction term is proportional to the geometric mean of the single-phase pressure gradients:\n$$ I = C \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{dp}{dz}\\right)_{l} \\left(\\frac{dp}{dz}\\right)_{g}} $$\nwhere $C$ is an empirical constant whose value depends on the flow regimes (laminar or turbulent) of the individual phases.\n\nSubstituting the expression for the interaction term $I$ into the postulated equation for the two-phase pressure gradient gives:\n$$ \\left(\\frac{dp}{dz}\\right)_{f} = \\left(\\frac{dp}{dz}\\right)_{l} + \\left(\\frac{dp}{dz}\\right)_{g} + C \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{dp}{dz}\\right)_{l} \\left(\\frac{dp}{dz}\\right)_{g}} $$\nTo obtain the desired expression for $\\phi_{l}^{2}$, we divide this entire equation by the liquid-only superficial pressure gradient, $(dp/dz)_{l}$:\n$$ \\frac{\\left(\\frac{dp}{dz}\\right)_{f}}{\\left(\\frac{dp}{dz}\\right)_{l}} = \\frac{\\left(\\frac{dp}{dz}\\right)_{l}}{\\left(\\fracdp}{dz}\\right)_{l}} + \\frac{\\left(\\frac{dp}{dz}\\right)_{g}}{\\left(\\frac{dp}{dz}\\right)_{l}} + C \\frac{\\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{dp}{dz}\\right)_{l} \\left(\\frac{dp}{dz}\\right)_{g}}}{\\left(\\frac{dp}{dz}\\right)_{l}} $$\nWe now substitute the definitions of $\\phi_{l}^{2}$ and $X$ into this equation.\nThe left-hand side is, by definition, $\\phi_{l}^{2}$.\nThe first term on the right-hand side is identically equal to $1$.\nThe second term on the right-hand side is the reciprocal of $X^2$:\n$$ \\frac{\\left(\\frac{dp}{dz}\\right)_{g}}{\\left(\\frac{dp}{dz}\\right)_{l}} = \\left( \\frac{\\left(\\frac{dp}{dz}\\right)_{l}}{\\left(\\frac{dp}{dz}\\right)_{g}} \\right)^{-1} = \\frac{1}{X^2} $$\nThe third term on the right-hand side can be simplified by bringing the denominator inside the square root:\n$$ C \\frac{\\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{dp}{dz}\\right)_{l} \\left(\\frac{dp}{dz}\\right)_{g}}}{\\left(\\frac{dp}{dz}\\right)_{l}} = C \\sqrt{\\frac{\\left(\\frac{dp}{dz}\\right)_{l} \\left(\\frac{dp}{dz}\\right)_{g}}{\\left(\\frac{dp}{dz}\\right)_{l}^2}} = C \\sqrt{\\frac{\\left(\\frac{dp}{dz}\\right)_{g}}{\\left(\\frac{dp}{dz}\\right)_{l}}} = \\frac{C}{X} $$\nAssembling these components and arranging them in the conventional order, we arrive at the derived expression:\n$$ \\phi_{l}^{2} = 1 + \\frac{C}{X} + \\frac{1}{X^2} $$\nThis is the widely used Chisholm correlation for the two-phase frictional pressure drop multiplier.\n\nFinally, we are required to evaluate $\\phi_{l}^{2}$ for the specific case where $X = 3$ and $C = 10$. Substituting these numerical values into the derived formula:\n$$ \\phi_{l}^{2} = 1 + \\frac{10}{3} + \\frac{1}{3^2} $$\n$$ \\phi_{l}^{2} = 1 + \\frac{10}{3} + \\frac{1}{9} $$\nTo sum these terms, we use a common denominator of $9$:\n$$ \\phi_{l}^{2} = \\frac{9}{9} + \\frac{30}{9} + \\frac{1}{9} = \\frac{9 + 30 + 1}{9} = \\frac{40}{9} $$\nThe result is an exact rational number as requested.\n\nThe physical interpretation of this result, $\\phi_{l}^{2} = 40/9 \\approx 4.44$, is that the frictional pressure loss for the air-water mixture under these conditions is approximately $4.44$ times greater than the pressure loss that would occur if only the water were flowing through the pipe at its given mass flow rate. This significant amplification of frictional loss is a characteristic feature of two-phase flow and is caused by the complex interactions between the phases, including increased liquid velocity due to reduced flow area and the presence of interfacial shear.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{40}{9}}$$", "id": "2521378"}, {"introduction": "A critical step in applying the Lockhart–Martinelli framework is selecting the correct empirical interaction coefficient, $C$, which depends on the flow regimes of the individual phases.

The calculation requires a three-step process: classification of the single-phase flow regimes, selection of the appropriate correlation coefficient, and application of the correlation formula.\n\nFirst, we classify the flow regime for each phase based on its single-phase Reynolds number, $Re$. The standard threshold for transition from laminar to turbulent flow in a circular tube is taken as $Re \\approx 2300$.\n\nThe liquid phase has a Reynolds number $Re_{l} = 800$.
