We proceed with a scaling analysis based on fundamental principles to determine the parametric dependence of the mean heat transfer coefficient, $\\bar{h}$. Let $\\delta$ be the characteristic thickness of the condensate film, and let $U$ be the characteristic velocity of the condensate draining down the tube under gravity. The analysis is built upon a momentum balance and an energy balance.\n\nFirst, we consider the momentum balance in the liquid film. The flow is driven by the gravitational body force, which is resisted by viscous shear. The net body force per unit volume is the buoyant force, given by $(\\rho_l - \\rho_v)g$, where $\\rho_l$ and $\\rho_v$ are the liquid and vapor densities, respectively, and $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity. The problem states that inertia is negligible, so we have a balance between the gravitational and viscous forces. For a characteristic analysis, this balance can be expressed as:\n$$\n\\mu_l \\frac{U}{\\delta^2} \\sim (\\rho_l - \\rho_v)g\n$$\nwhere $\\mu_l$ is the dynamic viscosity of the liquid. From this balance, we derive the scaling for the characteristic velocity $U$:\n$$\nU \\sim \\frac{(\\rho_l - \\rho_v)g \\delta^2}{\\mu_l}\n$$\nThe characteristic mass flow rate of condensate per unit length of the tube, $\\dot{m}'$, is the product of the liquid density, the characteristic velocity, and the film cross-sectional area (which scales with $\\delta$):\n$$\n\\dot{m}' \\sim \\rho_l U \\delta \\sim \\rho_l \\left( \\frac{(\\rho_l - \\rho_v)g \\delta^2}{\\mu_l} \\right) \\delta = \\frac{\\rho_l (\\rho_l - \\rho_v)g \\delta^3}{\\mu_l}\n$$\nThis is the characteristic mass of liquid that drains from the tube per unit time and per unit length.\n\nNext, we establish an energy balance. The energy released by the condensation process must be transferred through the liquid film to the tube wall. The total rate of heat transfer per unit length of the tube, $Q'$, is given by the product of the mean heat transfer coefficient $\\bar{h}$, the surface area per unit length ($\\pi D$), and the temperature difference $\\Delta T = T_{\\mathrm{sat}} - T_{w}$. For scaling purposes, we write:\n$$\nQ' \\sim \\bar{h} D \\Delta T\n$$\nThis heat transfer rate must equal the energy released by the phase change, which is the product of the condensation rate $\\dot{m}'$ and the latent heat of vaporization $h_{fg}$:\n$$\nQ' \\sim \\dot{m}' h_{fg}\n$$\nCombining these energy relations with the result from the momentum balance, we obtain our first key scaling relationship:\n$$\n\\bar{h} D \\Delta T \\sim \\left( \\frac{\\rho_l (\\rho_l - \\rho_v)g \\delta^3}{\\mu_l} \\right) h_{fg}\n$$\nThe problem also states that heat transfer across the film is by one-dimensional conduction. Therefore, the mean heat transfer coefficient $\\bar{h}$ is related to the film's thermal resistance. The heat flux is given by Fourier's law, $\\bar{q}'' \\sim k_l \\Delta T / \\delta$, where $k_l$ is the thermal conductivity of the liquid. Since $\\bar{q}'' = \\bar{h} \\Delta T$, we have a second key scaling relationship:\n$$\n\\bar{h} \\sim \\frac{k_l}{\\delta} \\quad \\implies \\quad \\delta \\sim \\frac{k_l}{\\bar{h}}\n$$\nWe now eliminate the characteristic film thickness $\\delta$ by substituting the second relationship into the first:\n$$\n\\bar{h} D \\Delta T \\sim \\left( \\frac{\\rho_l (\\rho_l - \\rho_v)g h_{fg}}{\\mu_l} \\right) \\left( \\frac{k_l}{\\bar{h}} \\right)^3\n$$\nRearranging this expression to solve for $\\bar{h}$ yields the parametric dependence:\n$$\n\\bar{h}^4 D \\Delta T \\sim \\frac{\\rho_l (\\rho_l - \\rho_v)g h_{fg} k_l^3}{\\mu_l}\n$$\n$$\n\\bar{h} \\sim \\left( \\frac{\\rho_l (\\rho_l - \\rho_v)g k_l^3 h_{fg}}{\\mu_l D \\Delta T} \\right)^{1/4}\n$$\nHaving derived the scaling law, we compute the logarithmic sensitivity of $\\bar{h}$ with respect to the liquid viscosity $\\mu_l$, which is defined as $S_{\\mu} = \\frac{\\partial \\ln \\bar{h}}{\\partial \\ln \\mu_l}$.\nFrom the scaling law, we can see that $\\bar{h}$ is proportional to $\\mu_l^{-1/4}$. We can write this as $\\bar{h} = C \\cdot \\mu_l^{-1/4}$, where $C$ is a constant of proportionality that incorporates all other parameters. Taking the natural logarithm of this expression gives:\n$$\n\\ln \\bar{h} = \\ln(C) + \\ln(\\mu_l^{-1/4}) = \\ln(C) - \\frac{1}{4} \\ln(\\mu_l)\n$$\nWe now compute the partial derivative with respect to $\\ln(\\mu_l)$:\n$$\nS_{\\mu} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\ln \\mu_l} \\left( \\ln(C) - \\frac{1}{4} \\ln(\\mu_l) \\right)\n$$\nSince $\\ln(C)$ is a constant with respect to $\\mu_l$, its derivative is $0$. The derivative of $\\ln(\\mu_l)$ with respect to itself is $1$.\n$$\nS_{\\mu} = 0 - \\frac{1}{4} \\cdot 1 = -\\frac{1}{4}\n$$\nThe value of $S_{\\mu} = -1/4$ has a distinct physical and practical interpretation. The logarithmic sensitivity is a measure of the relative change in an output variable ($\\bar{h}$) due to a relative change in an input parameter ($\\mu_l$).\n1. The negative sign indicates an inverse relationship: an increase in liquid viscosity $\\mu_l$ causes a decrease in the heat transfer coefficient $\\bar{h}$. This is because a higher viscosity impedes the gravitational drainage of the condensate, resulting in a thicker liquid film. A thicker film imposes a greater thermal resistance, which in turn reduces the overall heat transfer rate.\n2. The magnitude, $1/4$, quantifies the strength of this effect. It implies that the fractional change in $\\bar{h}$ is only one-quarter of the fractional change in $\\mu_l$. For example, a $20\\%$ uncertainty in the value of $\\mu_l$ used in a calculation propagates to a much smaller uncertainty of approximately $20\\% \\times (1/4) = 5\\%$ in the predicted value of $\\bar{h}$.

The problem is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. A solution will be derived.\n\n**Solution Derivation**\n\nThe problem has two parts: a qualitative argument regarding the choice of reference temperature for liquid properties, and a quantitative calculation of the effect of this choice.\n\n**1) Consistency Argument for Reference Temperature**\n\nThe physical processes governing film condensation are heat and momentum transport within the liquid film.\n- Heat is transferred by conduction from the vapor-liquid interface at temperature $T_{sat}$ to the solid wall at temperature $T_w$, across the liquid film.\n- The condensate flows downward due to gravity, resisted by viscous forces within the film.\nThe crucial liquid properties governing these processes are thermal conductivity $k_l$ (for heat conduction) and dynamic viscosity $\\mu_l$ (for momentum transport/fluid flow), along with density $\\rho_l$. All these properties are temperature-dependent.\n\nThe classical Nusselt analysis simplifies the problem by assuming these properties are constant. However, in reality, a temperature gradient exists across the film, from $T_{sat}$ to $T_w$. To make a single, representative choice for property evaluation, one must select a temperature that best reflects the average conditions within the medium where transport occurs.\n- Evaluating properties at $T_{sat}$ would only represent the state of the liquid at the outer edge of the film, ignoring the colder, more viscous, and denser liquid near the tube surface.\n- Evaluating properties at $T_w$ would similarly misrepresent the conditions, focusing only on the wall boundary.\n\nThe most logical and physically consistent approach is to evaluate the liquid properties at the mean film temperature, $T_f = (T_{sat} + T_w)/2$. This temperature represents an average condition throughout the liquid film where the transport phenomena of interest (conduction and viscous flow) are actually taking place. Therefore, evaluating properties at $T_f$ is a more accurate and consistent approximation than using either of the boundary temperatures.\n\n**2) Quantitative Analysis**\n\nThe average heat transfer coefficient, $\\bar{h}$, for laminar film condensation on a single horizontal tube is given by the Nusselt theory:\n$$ \\bar{h} = C \\left[ \\frac{\\rho_l (\\rho_l - \\rho_v) g k_l^3 h'_{fg}}{\\mu_l (T_{sat} - T_w) D} \\right]^{1/4} $$\nwhere $C$ is a constant (typically $0.729$), and $h'_{fg}$ is the modified latent heat. The problem directs us to use the standard latent heat $h_{fg}$ and to treat it and $\\rho_v$ as constants, irrespective of the reference temperature for liquid properties. The quantities $g$, $D$, and $(T_{sat}-T_w)$ are also constant for this comparison.\n\nThus, the heat transfer coefficient $\\bar{h}$ is proportional to the a group of liquid properties raised to the $1/4$ power:\n$$ \\bar{h} \\propto \\left[ \\frac{\\rho_l (\\rho_l - \\rho_v) k_l^3}{\\mu_l} \\right]^{1/4} $$\nSince $\\rho_v \\ll \\rho_l$, the term $\\rho_l(\\rho_l - \\rho_v)$ is very nearly $\\rho_l^2$. The dependence is effectively on $(\\rho_l^2 k_l^3 / \\mu_l)^{1/4}$.\n\nWe are asked to compute the ratio $R = h(T_f)/h(T_{sat})$, where $h(T_f)$ is the coefficient calculated with liquid properties at $T_f$, and $h(T_{sat})$ is the coefficient calculated with liquid properties at $T_{sat}$.\n$$ R = \\frac{h(T_f)}{h(T_{sat})} = \\left[ \\frac{ \\left( \\frac{\\rho_l(T_f)^2 k_l(T_f)^3}{\\mu_l(T_f)} \\right) }{ \\left( \\frac{\\rho_l(T_{sat})^2 k_l(T_{sat})^3}{\\mu_l(T_{sat})} \\right) } \\right]^{1/4} $$\n$$ R = \\left[ \\left(\\frac{\\rho_l(T_f)}{\\rho_l(T_{sat})}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{k_l(T_f)}{k_l(T_{sat})}\\right)^3 \\left(\\frac{\\mu_l(T_{sat})}{\\mu_l(T_f)}\\right) \\right]^{1/4} $$\nSubstituting the given property values:\n- $\\rho_l(T_f) = 972\\,\\mathrm{kg/m^3}$\n- $\\rho_l(T_{sat}) = 958\\,\\mathrm{kg/m^3}$\n- $k_l(T_f) = 0.670\\,\\mathrm{W/(m\\cdot K)}$\n- $k_l(T_{sat}) = 0.679\\,\\mathrm{W/(m\\cdot K)}$\n- $\\mu_l(T_f) = 3.35 \\times 10^{-4}\\,\\mathrm{Pa\\cdot s}$\n- $\\mu_l(T_{sat}) = 2.82 \\times 10^{-4}\\,\\mathrm{Pa\\cdot s}$\n\nNow, we compute the ratio:\n$$ R = \\left[ \\left(\\frac{972}{958}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{0.670}{0.679}\\right)^3 \\left(\\frac{2.82 \\times 10^{-4}}{3.35 \\times 10^{-4}}\\right) \\right]^{1/4} $$\n$$ R = \\left[ (1.01461)^2 (0.98675)^3 (0.84179) \\right]^{1/4} $$\n$$ R = \\left[ (1.02943) (0.96081) (0.84179) \\right]^{1/4} $$\n$$ R = \\left[ 0.83187 \\right]^{1/4} $$\n$$ R \\approx 0.9551 $$\nSo, $h(T_f) \\approx 0.955 \\, h(T_{sat})$.\n\nThe percent difference is calculated as $\\frac{h(T_f) - h(T_{sat})}{h(T_{sat})} \\times 100\\% = (R-1) \\times 100\\%$.\nPercent difference $= (0.9551 - 1) \\times 100\\% = -4.49\\%$.\nThis means that using the film temperature properties results in a predicted heat transfer coefficient that is approximately $4.5\\%$ lower than the prediction using saturation temperature properties.\n\n**Option-by-Option Analysis**\n\n**A.

The heat rate per unit length is then:\n$$ q' = \\dot{m}' h_{fg} \\sim \\rho_{l} u \\delta h_{fg} \\quad (3) $$\n\nEquating the two expressions for $q'$ from equations $(2)$ and $(3)$:\n$$ k_{l} \\frac{\\Delta T \\cdot D}{\\delta} \\sim \\rho_{l} u \\delta h_{fg} $$\nNow we substitute the expression for the velocity $u$ from the momentum balance, equation $(1)$:\n$$ k_{l} \\frac{\\Delta T \\cdot D}{\\delta} \\sim \\rho_{l} \\left( \\frac{\\rho_{l} g \\delta^2}{\\mu_{l}} \\right) \\delta h_{fg} $$\nRearranging to solve for the film thickness $\\delta$:\n$$ k_{l} \\Delta T D \\sim \\frac{\\rho_{l}^2 g h_{fg}}{\\mu_{l}} \\delta^4 $$\n$$ \\delta^4 \\sim \\frac{\\mu_{l} k_{l} \\Delta T D}{\\rho_{l}^2 g h_{fg}} $$\nThe terms $\\mu_{l}$, $k_{l}$, $\\Delta T$, $\\rho_{l}$, $g$, and $h_{fg}$ are all specified to be constant. Therefore, the scaling for $\\delta$ with respect to the tube diameter $D$ is:\n$$ \\delta \\propto D^{1/4} $$\n\nThe average heat transfer coefficient $\\bar{h}$ is defined by $q' = \\bar{h} (\\pi D) \\Delta T$. Using our scaling expression for $q'$ from conduction, equation $(2)$:\n$$ \\bar{h} (\\pi D) \\Delta T \\sim k_{l} \\frac{\\Delta T \\cdot D}{\\delta} $$\n$$ \\bar{h} \\sim \\frac{k_{l}}{\\delta} $$\nSince $\\delta \\propto D^{1/4}$, the scaling for $\\bar{h}$ is:\n$$ \\bar{h} \\propto \\frac{1}{D^{1/4}} = D^{-1/4} $$\nThus, the exponent $m$ in the relation $\\bar{h} \\propto D^m$ is $m = -1/4$.\n\nPart (b): Scaling of the volumetric conductance $C_v$.\n\nFirst, we determine the scaling of the surface-area density $a_s$. The quantity $a_s$ is defined as the external tube surface area per unit bundle volume.\n$$ a_s = \\frac{\\text{Total external surface area}}{\\text{Total bundle volume}} $$\nConsider a segment of the bundle of length $L$. The volume is $V_{bundle} = A_{c} L$, where $A_c$ is the cross-sectional area of the bundle. The total surface area is $A_{s,total} = N_{tubes} \\times (\\pi D L)$, where $N_{tubes}$ is the number of tubes in the bundle. The number of tubes can be expressed as $N_{tubes} = N_A A_c$, where $N_A$ is the number of tubes per unit cross-sectional area.\nSubstituting these into the definition of $a_s$:\n$$ a_s = \\frac{(N_A A_c) (\\pi D L)}{A_c L} = N_A \\pi D $$\nThe tubes are arranged in an equilateral triangular array with pitch $p$. A unit cell in this array can be taken as a parallelogram with side length $p$ and an internal angle of $60^{\\circ}$. The area of this unit cell is $A_{cell} = p^2 \\sin(60^{\\circ}) = p^2 \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}$. This unit cell contains one tube on average. Therefore, the number of tubes per unit area is:\n$$ N_A = \\frac{1}{A_{cell}} = \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{3} p^2} $$\nSubstituting this into the expression for $a_s$:\n$$ a_s = \\left( \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{3} p^2} \\right) \\pi D = \\frac{2 \\pi D}{\\sqrt{3} p^2} $$\nThe problem states that the pitch ratio $\\alpha = p/D$ is constant. Thus, $p = \\alpha D$. Substituting this for $p$:\n$$ a_s = \\frac{2 \\pi D}{\\sqrt{3} (\\alpha D)^2} = \\frac{2 \\pi D}{\\sqrt{3} \\alpha^2 D^2} = \\left( \\frac{2 \\pi}{\\sqrt{3} \\alpha^2} \\right) \\frac{1}{D} $$\nSince $\\alpha$ is a constant, the entire term in parentheses is a constant. The scaling for $a_s$ is therefore:\n$$ a_s \\propto \\frac{1}{D} = D^{-1} $$\n\nFinally, we determine the scaling of the volumetric conductance $C_v \\equiv \\bar{h} a_s$. We combine the scaling laws derived for $\\bar{h}$ and $a_s$:\n$$ \\bar{h} \\propto D^{-1/4} $$\n$$ a_s \\propto D^{-1} $$\nTherefore,\n$$ C_v \\propto (D^{-1/4})(D^{-1}) = D^{-1/4 - 1} = D^{-5/4} $$\nThe problem asks for the exponent $n$ in the relation $C_v \\propto D^n$. By comparison, we find:\n$$ n = -\\frac{5}{4} = -1.25 $$\nThe problem requests the numerical value of $n$ rounded to four significant figures.\n$$ n = -1.250 $$\nThis concludes the derivation.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{-1.250}$$", "id": "2484854"}]}
