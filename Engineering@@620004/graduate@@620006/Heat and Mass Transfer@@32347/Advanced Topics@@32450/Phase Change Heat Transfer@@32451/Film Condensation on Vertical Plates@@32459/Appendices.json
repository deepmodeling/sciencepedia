It describes a classic scenario of laminar film condensation on a vertical plate, solvable using the Nusselt theory. The assumptions provided are standard and sufficient for a unique solution. We shall proceed with the derivation.\n\nThe analysis begins by establishing a coordinate system. Let the vertical coordinate $x$ be directed downwards from the top of the plate ($x=0$), and the horizontal coordinate $y$ be normal to the plate surface, starting from the wall ($y=0$). The liquid film has a local thickness $\\delta(x)$ at a given position $x$.\n\nFirst, we consider the conservation of momentum for the liquid condensate film. The problem states to neglect inertia and vapor shear. Therefore, the momentum equation in the $x$-direction for a Newtonian fluid reduces to a balance between the body force (buoyancy) and the viscous shear force:\n$$\n\\mu_{\\ell} \\frac{d^2u}{dy^2} + (\\rho_{\\ell} - \\rho_v)g = 0\n$$\nwhere $u$ is the fluid velocity in the $x$-direction, $\\mu_{\\ell}$ is the dynamic viscosity of the liquid, $\\rho_{\\ell}$ is the liquid density, $\\rho_v$ is the vapor density, and $g$ is the gravitational acceleration.

No-slip condition at the plate wall: $u(y=0) = 0$.\n2. Negligible shear stress at the liquid-vapor interface: $\\tau(y=\\delta) = \\mu_{\\ell} \\frac{du}{dy}\\Big|_{y=\\delta} = 0$.\n\nIntegrating the momentum equation twice with respect to $y$ yields:\n$$\n\\frac{du}{dy} = -\\frac{g(\\rho_{\\ell} - \\rho_v)}{\\mu_{\\ell}} y + C_1\n$$\n$$\nu(y) = -\\frac{g(\\rho_{\\ell} - \\rho_v)}{2\\mu_{\\ell}} y^2 + C_1 y + C_2\n$$\nApplying the boundary conditions:\nThe no-slip condition $u(0)=0$ gives $C_2=0$.\nThe zero shear condition at $y=\\delta(x)$ gives:\n$$\n\\frac{du}{dy}\\Big|_{y=\\delta} = -\\frac{g(\\rho_{\\ell} - \\rho_v)}{\\mu_{\\ell}} \\delta + C_1 = 0 \\implies C_1 = \\frac{g(\\rho_{\\ell} - \\rho_v)}{\\mu_{\\ell}} \\delta\n$$\nSubstituting $C_1$ and $C_2$ into the expression for $u(y)$, we obtain the parabolic velocity profile:\n$$\nu(y) = \\frac{g(\\rho_{\\ell} - \\rho_v)}{\\mu_{\\ell}} \\left(\\delta y - \\frac{y^2}{2}\\right)\n$$\nThe mass flow rate of the condensate per unit width of the plate, $\\Gamma(x)$, is found by integrating the velocity profile across the film thickness:\n$$\n\\Gamma(x) = \\int_{0}^{\\delta(x)} \\rho_{\\ell} u(y) dy = \\rho_{\\ell} \\int_{0}^{\\delta(x)} \\frac{g(\\rho_{\\ell} - \\rho_v)}{\\mu_{\\ell}} \\left(\\delta y - \\frac{y^2}{2}\\right) dy\n$$\n$$\n\\Gamma(x) = \\frac{\\rho_{\\ell} g(\\rho_{\\ell} - \\rho_v) \\delta^3}{3\\mu_{\\ell}}\n$$\nNext, we apply the principle of conservation of energy.

Typical laminar condensate films on vertical plates are much thinner than this value, so radiation is often negligible under such conditions.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{3.72}$$", "id": "2485280"}]}
