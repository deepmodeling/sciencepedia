We begin by applying the first law of thermodynamics, the conservation of energy, to a differential control volume of the fluid within the tube. The control volume is a disk of infinitesimal length $dz$ at an axial position $z$.\n\nUnder steady-state conditions, the rate of heat added to the fluid must equal the rate of increase of the fluid's enthalpy flow. The heat added to the control volume is provided by the uniform wall heat flux $q''$ over the internal surface area of the tubing element, which is the product of the perimeter $P = \\pi D$ and the length $dz$.\n$$\ndQ = q'' P dz = q'' (\\pi D) dz\n$$\nThe rate of enthalpy flow through a cross-section is $\\dot{H} = \\dot{m} h$, where $\\dot{m}$ is the mass flow rate and $h$ is the specific enthalpy of the bulk fluid.

The thermodynamic quality $x$ increases linearly with $z$ beyond this point. The heat transfer from the wall is governed by the two-phase heat transfer coefficient $h_{tp}$ according to the relation $q'' = h_{tp}(T_w - T_{sat})$.\n\n- **Saturated Nucleate Boiling Regime:** Immediately following $z^{\\star}$ (at low quality $x$), the flow is typically in the bubbly or slug flow regime. Heat transfer is dominated by nucleate boiling, where bubbles form at nucleation sites on the hot wall and detach into the flow. In this region, the heat transfer coefficient is very high and is a strong function of the heat flux $q''$ but relatively insensitive to quality $x$ or mass velocity $G$. Since $q''$ is constant, $h_{tp}$ and thus the wall superheat $(T_w - T_{sat})$ will be nearly constant. The wall temperature $T_w$ will be slightly above $T_{sat}$ and will remain relatively flat. It is important to note that the **Onset of Nucleate Boiling (ONB)**, the point where bubbles first form, may have occurred upstream of $z^{\\star}$ in the subcooled region if the wall temperature there exceeded $T_{sat}$ sufficiently.\n\n- **Convective Boiling Regime:** As quality $x$ increases further, the flow pattern typically transitions to annular flow, where a liquid film lines the tube wall and a vapor core flows in the center. In this regime, the heat transfer mechanism transitions to a combination of nucleate boiling within the film and forced convection evaporation at the liquid-vapor interface. This is often termed convective boiling. The heat transfer coefficient $h_{tp}$ becomes increasingly dependent on flow parameters like quality $x$ and mass velocity $G$. As $x$ increases, the liquid film thins and the core velocity increases, which typically enhances the heat transfer coefficient. Consequently, for a constant $q''$, the wall temperature $T_w$ may show a slight decrease in this region.\n\n- **Dryout and Post-Dryout Regime:** With continuing heat addition, the liquid film becomes progressively thinner until it breaks down at a certain high quality. This condition is known as **dryout**. The point of dryout corresponds to the **Critical Heat Flux (CHF)** condition for forced convective boiling under a high, imposed heat flux. At the point of dryout, the wall is no longer wetted by liquid, and heat must be transferred directly to the vapor phase. The heat transfer coefficient for convection to vapor is drastically lower than for boiling liquid. Because the system is heat-flux-controlled ($q''$ is constant), the relationship $q'' = h(T_w - T_{sat})$ mandates a sudden and very large increase in the wall temperature $T_w$ to dissipate the same heat flux. This temperature excursion can lead to physical failure of the tube, a phenomenon known as burnout. Therefore, for $z$ beyond the dryout location, the wall temperature will be extremely high.\n\nIn summary, for $z  z^{\\star}$, the wall temperature is expected to be relatively constant and slightly above saturation temperature, possibly with a slight dip, followed by a sharp, dramatic increase upon reaching the dryout condition.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.07838}$$", "id": "2488261"}, {"introduction": "To truly master forced convection boiling, we must deconstruct the heat transfer at the wall into its constituent parts.

The first is a mechanistic explanation of the effect of subcooling, and the second is a quantitative derivation and calculation based on a simplified model.\n\n1) Mechanistic Explanation\n\nThe total heat flux from the surface, $q''_{\\text{total}}$, which is maintained at a fixed value, is partitioned into several components. For subcooled flow boiling, the primary modes of heat transfer are:\n- $q''_{e}$: Latent heat transport via evaporation at the base of the bubbles.\n- $q''_{c}$: Single-phase forced convection in the regions of the surface covered by liquid.\n- $q''_{q}$: Transient conduction (quenching) to the fresh liquid that rewets the surface following bubble departure.\n\nThe energy balance over the heated wall can be expressed as an area-weighted sum of these components:\n$$ q''_{\\text{total}} = \\text{constant} = q''_{e,\\text{avg}} + q''_{c,\\text{avg}} + q''_{q,\\text{avg}} $$\nwhere the subscript 'avg' denotes a value averaged over the entire heating area and time.\n\nThe heat fluxes for single-phase convection and quenching are driven by the temperature difference between the wall and the bulk liquid, $(T_w - T_{\\infty})$. This temperature difference can be expressed in terms of the wall superheat, $\\Delta T_{\\text{sat}} = T_w - T_{\\text{sat}}$, and the liquid subcooling, $\\Delta T_{\\text{sub}} = T_{\\text{sat}} - T_{\\infty}$:\n$$ (T_w - T_{\\infty}) = (T_w - T_{\\text{sat}}) + (T_{\\text{sat}} - T_{\\infty}) = \\Delta T_{\\text{sat}} + \\Delta T_{\\text{sub}} $$\nWhen the bulk liquid subcooling is increased from $\\Delta T_{\\text{sub},1}$ to $\\Delta T_{\\text{sub},2}$, the temperature difference $(T_w - T_{\\infty})$ increases. This directly enhances the rate of sensible heat transfer to the liquid. Both the single-phase convection component, $q''_{c}$, and the quenching component, $q''_{q}$, will increase in magnitude.\n\nSince $q''_{\\text{total}}$ is fixed, the principle of conservation of energy dictates that the increase in the sensible heat transfer components ($q''_{c,\\text{avg}} + q''_{q,\\text{avg}}$) must be compensated by a decrease in the evaporative component, $q''_{e,\\text{avg}}$.\n\nA decrease in the evaporative heat flux has two primary physical consequences:\n\n- **Bubble Lifetime and Size**: The colder bulk liquid surrounding the bubble enhances condensation on the bubble cap, which protrudes into the subcooled flow. This faster condensation rate leads to a shorter bubble lifetime and a smaller bubble volume at the point of departure from the surface.\n\n- **Nucleation Site Activity**: For a bubble to exist, the wall superheat $\\Delta T_{\\text{sat}}$ must be sufficient to overcome surface tension effects within a nucleation cavity of radius $r_c$. The condition for activation is approximately $\\Delta T_{\\text{sat}} \\geq \\frac{2\\sigma T_{\\text{sat}}}{h_{fg}\\rho_v r_c}$, where $\\sigma$ is surface tension, $h_{fg}$ is the latent heat of vaporization, and $\\rho_v$ is the vapor density. In a system where the total heat flux is fixed (rather than a fixed wall temperature), the enhanced sensible cooling would cause the average wall temperature, and thus the wall superheat $\\Delta T_{\\text{sat}}$, to decrease. A lower $\\Delta T_{\\text{sat}}$ means that only larger cavities (larger $r_c$) can remain active, leading to a deactivation of some nucleation sites and a decrease in the active site density, $N_a$. While the problem specifies a fixed $T_w$ as an idealization, the fundamental mechanism of boiling suppression with increased subcooling remains. The assumption of constant $N_a$ and $f_b$ is a simplification for the subsequent calculation.\n\n2) Derivation and Calculation of the Quenching Heat Flux Ratio\n\nWe analyze the heat transfer to a semi-infinite body of liquid, initially at temperature $T_{\\infty}$, that suddenly comes into contact with a surface maintained at a constant temperature $T_w$. The process is governed by the one-dimensional unsteady heat conduction equation in the liquid:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial t} = \\alpha_{\\ell} \\frac{\\partial^2 T}{\\partial y^2} $$\nwhere $y$ is the coordinate normal to the wall. The initial and boundary conditions are:\n- Initial Condition: $T(y, t=0) = T_{\\infty}$ for $y  0$.\n- Boundary Conditions: $T(y=0, t0) = T_w$ and $T(y \\to \\infty, t0) = T_{\\infty}$.\n\nThe solution to this classical problem for the temperature profile $T(y,t)$ is given in terms of the error function, $\\text{erf}(z)$:\n$$ \\frac{T(y,t) - T_w}{T_{\\infty} - T_w} = \\text{erf}\\left(\\frac{y}{2\\sqrt{\\alpha_{\\ell}t}}\\right) $$\nThe instantaneous heat flux from the wall into the liquid, $q''_q(t)$, is given by Fourier's law of conduction:\n$$ q''_q(t) = -k_{\\ell} \\left. \\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial y} \\right|_{y=0} $$\nWe first compute the temperature gradient $\\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial y}$:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial y} = (T_{\\infty} - T_w) \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y} \\left[ \\text{erf}\\left(\\frac{y}{2\\sqrt{\\alpha_{\\ell}t}}\\right) \\right] = (T_{\\infty} - T_w) \\left[ \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{\\pi}} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{y^2}{4\\alpha_{\\ell}t}\\right) \\cdot \\frac{1}{2\\sqrt{\\alpha_{\\ell}t}} \\right] $$\nEvaluating the gradient at the wall ($y=0$):\n$$ \\left. \\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial y} \\right|_{y=0} = \\frac{T_{\\infty} - T_w}{\\sqrt{\\pi \\alpha_{\\ell}t}} $$\nSubstituting this into Fourier's law gives the instantaneous heat flux during a single quenching event:\n$$ q''_q(t) = -k_{\\ell} \\left( \\frac{T_{\\infty} - T_w}{\\sqrt{\\pi \\alpha_{\\ell}t}} \\right) = \\frac{k_{\\ell}(T_w - T_{\\infty})}{\\sqrt{\\pi \\alpha_{\\ell}t}} $$\nThe total energy transferred per unit area during a single quenching event of duration $t_q$ is:\n$$ Q''_{\\text{event}} = \\int_0^{t_q} q''_q(t) dt = \\frac{k_{\\ell}(T_w - T_{\\infty})}{\\sqrt{\\pi \\alpha_{\\ell}}} \\int_0^{t_q} t^{-1/2} dt = \\frac{k_{\\ell}(T_w - T_{\\infty})}{\\sqrt{\\pi \\alpha_{\\ell}}} [2t^{1/2}]_0^{t_q} = 2k_{\\ell}(T_w - T_{\\infty}) \\sqrt{\\frac{t_q}{\\pi \\alpha_{\\ell}}} $$\nThe total energy transferred during one event at a single site of area $A_w$ is $E_{\\text{event}} = Q''_{\\text{event}} \\cdot A_w$.\nThe time-averaged areal quenching heat flux, $q''_{q,\\text{avg}}$, is the total energy transferred from all quenching sites per unit total area per unit time. With an active site density of $N_a$ and a bubbling frequency of $f_b$, this is:\n$$ q''_{q,\\text{avg}} = E_{\\text{event}} \\cdot N_a \\cdot f_b = \\left( A_w \\cdot 2k_{\\ell}(T_w - T_{\\infty}) \\sqrt{\\frac{t_q}{\\pi \\alpha_{\\ell}}} \\right) N_a f_b $$\nRearranging the terms, the expression for the average quenching heat flux is:\n$$ q''_{q,\\text{avg}} = 2 N_a f_b A_w k_{\\ell} \\sqrt{\\frac{t_q}{\\pi \\alpha_{\\ell}}} (T_w - T_{\\infty}) $$\nWe are asked to compute the ratio $R \\equiv \\frac{q''_{q,\\text{avg}}(\\Delta T_{\\text{sub},2})}{q''_{q,\\text{avg}}(\\Delta T_{\\text{sub},1})}$. Based on the derived expression, and the problem's assumption that $N_a$, $f_b$, $A_w$, $k_{\\ell}$, $\\alpha_{\\ell}$, and $t_q$ are constant, the ratio simplifies to:\n$$ R = \\frac{2 N_a f_b A_w k_{\\ell} \\sqrt{\\frac{t_q}{\\pi \\alpha_{\\ell}}} (T_w - T_{\\infty,2})}{2 N_a f_b A_w k_{\\ell} \\sqrt{\\frac{t_q}{\\pi \\alpha_{\\ell}}} (T_w - T_{\\infty,1})} = \\frac{T_w - T_{\\infty,2}}{T_w - T_{\\infty,1}} $$\nUsing the relation $T_{\\infty} = T_{\\text{sat}} - \\Delta T_{\\text{sub}}$, we can write the denominator and numerator as:\n- $T_w - T_{\\infty,1} = (T_w - T_{\\text{sat}}) + \\Delta T_{\\text{sub},1}$\n- $T_w - T_{\\infty,2} = (T_w - T_{\\text{sat}}) + \\Delta T_{\\text{sub},2}$\n\nThe problem provides the following numerical values:\n- Wall temperature, $T_w = 108\\,^{\\circ}\\text{C}$\n- Saturation temperature, $T_{\\text{sat}} = 100\\,^{\\circ}\\text{C}$\n- Initial subcooling, $\\Delta T_{\\text{sub},1} = 5\\ \\text{K}$\n- Final subcooling, $\\Delta T_{\\text{sub},2} = 15\\ \\text{K}$\n\nThe wall superheat is $\\Delta T_{\\text{sat}} = T_w - T_{\\text{sat}} = 108 - 100 = 8\\,\\text{K}$.\nNow we compute the temperature differences:\n- $T_w - T_{\\infty,1} = 8\\,\\text{K} + 5\\,\\text{K} = 13\\,\\text{K}$\n- $T_w - T_{\\infty,2} = 8\\,\\text{K} + 15\\,\\text{K} = 23\\,\\text{K}$\n\nThe ratio $R$ is therefore:\n$$ R = \\frac{23}{13} \\approx 1.7692307... $$\nRounding to four significant figures, we obtain $R = 1.769$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{1.769}$$", "id": "2488269"}]}
