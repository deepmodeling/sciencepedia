The core premise is that the CHF is governed by a hydrodynamically limited vapor mass flux, $\\dot{m}''_{\\text{crit}}$, which is assumed to be constant for both saturated and subcooled conditions. The wall heat flux, $q''$, provides the necessary enthalpy to create this vapor flux.\n\nFirst, consider the case of saturated boiling. The liquid at the inlet of the control volume is at its saturation temperature, $T_{\\text{sat}}$. The energy supplied by the heater is used exclusively for the phase change, providing the latent heat of vaporization, $h_{fg}$. The energy balance at the critical condition is given by:\n$$q''_{\\text{CHF},\\,\\text{sat}} = \\dot{m}''_{\\text{crit}} h_{fg}$$\n\nNext, consider the case of subcooled boiling. The liquid enters the control volume at a temperature $T_{\\text{l}}$ below the saturation temperature $T_{\\text{sat}}$. The degree of subcooling is $\\Delta T_{\\text{sub}} = T_{\\text{sat}} - T_{\\text{l}}$. In this case, the energy supplied by the heater must first raise the temperature of the liquid from $T_{\\text{l}}$ to $T_{\\text{sat}}$ (sensible heat) and then provide the latent heat for vaporization. The sensible heat required per unit mass is modeled as $c_{pl} \\Delta T_{\\text{sub}}$, where $c_{pl}$ is the specific heat of the liquid. The total enthalpy increase per unit mass is therefore the sum of the sensible and latent parts.

It describes a classical problem in heat transfer—the prediction of critical heat flux (CHF)—with a well-defined modification for finite-size effects. We shall proceed with its solution.\n\nThe problem requires us to model the critical heat flux based on the hydrodynamic theory of boiling crises. This theory, pioneered by Zuber, postulates that CHF is triggered by an instability of the vapor-liquid interface, which limits the rate at which liquid can return to the heated surface to cool it. The governing instability is of the Rayleigh-Taylor type, where a heavy fluid (liquid) is situated above a light fluid (vapor) in a gravitational field $g$. Surface tension $\\sigma$ acts as a stabilizing force, particularly at short wavelengths.\n\nThe dispersion relation for small-amplitude capillary-gravity waves at the interface, neglecting viscous effects, is given by:\n$$ \\omega^2 = \\frac{g k (\\rho_{\\ell} - \\rho_{v}) - \\sigma k^3}{\\rho_{\\ell} + \\rho_{v}} $$\nHere, $\\omega$ is the angular frequency and $k$ is the wavenumber. The interface is unstable if $\\omega^2  0$, which occurs for wavenumbers $k  k_c = \\sqrt{g (\\rho_{\\ell} - \\rho_{v}) / \\sigma}$. The instability growth rate, $|\\omega|$, is maximized at the \"most unstable\" wavenumber, $k_m$. To find $k_m$, we find the minimum of $\\omega^2$ by setting its derivative with respect to $k$ to zero:\n$$ \\frac{d(\\omega^2)}{dk} = \\frac{g (\\rho_{\\ell} - \\rho_{v}) - 3 \\sigma k^2}{\\rho_{\\ell} + \\rho_{v}} = 0 $$\n$$ g (\\rho_{\\ell} - \\rho_{v}) - 3 \\sigma k_m^2 = 0 $$\nThis yields the most unstable wavenumber for an unbounded (infinite) interface:\n$$ k_m = \\sqrt{\\frac{g (\\rho_{\\ell} - \\rho_{v})}{3 \\sigma}} $$\n\nThe classical Zuber-Kutateladze model for CHF on an infinite horizontal plate relates the heat flux to the energy required to sustain the counterflow of vapor and liquid, which is limited by this instability. The standard correlation is:\n$$ q''_{\\mathrm{crit,Z}} = C_Z h_{fg} \\rho_v^{1/2} [g \\sigma (\\rho_{\\ell} - \\rho_v)]^{1/4} $$\nwhere $C_Z$ is a constant, given as $0.131$. It is instructive to rewrite the term in brackets using our expression for $k_m$. From the derivation of $k_m$, we have $g(\\rho_{\\ell} - \\rho_v) = 3\\sigma k_m^2$. Substituting this into the term gives:\n$$ [g \\sigma (\\rho_{\\ell} - \\rho_v)]^{1/4} = [\\sigma (3 \\sigma k_m^2)]^{1/4} = [3 \\sigma^2 k_m^2]^{1/4} = (3)^{1/4} \\sqrt{\\sigma k_m} $$\nThus, the Zuber CHF correlation for an infinite surface can be expressed in terms of the most unstable wavenumber $k_m$:\n$$ q''_{\\mathrm{crit,Z}} = C_Z (3)^{1/4} h_{fg} \\rho_v^{1/2} \\sqrt{\\sigma k_m} $$\nThis expression reveals that $q''_{\\mathrm{crit,Z}}$ is proportional to the square root of the governing instability wavenumber, $q''_{\\mathrm{crit,Z}} \\propto \\sqrt{k_m}$.\n\nThe problem introduces a crucial modification for a finite heater of diameter $D$. The finite extent of the heater imposes a geometric constraint on the possible instability wavelengths. The longest wavelength that can form is on the order of the heater size itself. This corresponds to a minimum accessible wavenumber, which the problem states is $k_{\\min} \\approx \\pi/D$. The instability will manifest at the greater of the natural hydrodynamic wavenumber and this geometrically imposed wavenumber. Therefore, the effective wavenumber controlling the instability is:\n$$ k_{\\mathrm{eff}} = \\max(k_m, k_{\\min}) = \\max\\left(k_m, \\frac{\\pi}{D}\\right) $$\nWe can logically extend the hydrodynamic model by asserting that the CHF for the finite heater, $q''_{\\mathrm{crit,D}}$, follows the same scaling relationship as the infinite-plate case, but with the effective wavenumber $k_{\\mathrm{eff}}$ replacing $k_m$:\n$$ q''_{\\mathrm{crit,D}} \\propto \\sqrt{k_{\\mathrm{eff}}} $$\nThis allows us to find the corrected CHF by taking a ratio with the classical Zuber value:\n$$ \\frac{q''_{\\mathrm{crit,D}}}{q''_{\\mathrm{crit,Z}}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{k_{\\mathrm{eff}}}}{\\sqrt{k_m}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\max(k_m, \\pi/D)}{k_m}} $$\nWe now proceed with the numerical calculation using the provided properties for FC-72 at $1\\ \\mathrm{atm}$:\n$\\rho_{\\ell} = 1.68\\times 10^{3}\\ \\mathrm{kg\\,m^{-3}}$, $\\rho_{v} = 12.5\\ \\mathrm{kg\\,m^{-3}}$, $\\sigma = 1.0\\times 10^{-2}\\ \\mathrm{N\\,m^{-1}}$, $h_{fg} = 8.8\\times 10^{4}\\ \\mathrm{J\\,kg^{-1}}$, $g = 9.81\\ \\mathrm{m\\,s^{-2}}$, $D = 2\\ \\mathrm{mm} = 2 \\times 10^{-3}\\ \\mathrm{m}$, and $C_Z = 0.131$.\n\nFirst, we calculate the density difference:\n$$ \\rho_{\\ell} - \\rho_{v} = 1680 - 12.5 = 1667.5\\ \\mathrm{kg\\,m^{-3}} $$\nNext, we calculate the most unstable wavenumber $k_m$:\n$$ k_m = \\sqrt{\\frac{(9.81\\ \\mathrm{m\\,s^{-2}}) (1667.5\\ \\mathrm{kg\\,m^{-3}})}{3 (1.0\\times 10^{-2}\\ \\mathrm{N\\,m^{-1}})}} = \\sqrt{545272.5\\ \\mathrm{m^{-2}}} \\approx 738.4\\ \\mathrm{m^{-1}} $$\nThen, we calculate the minimum wavenumber imposed by the heater dimension:\n$$ k_{\\min} = \\frac{\\pi}{D} = \\frac{\\pi}{2 \\times 10^{-3}\\ \\mathrm{m}} \\approx 1570.8\\ \\mathrm{m^{-1}} $$\nThe effective wavenumber is the maximum of these two:\n$$ k_{\\mathrm{eff}} = \\max(738.4, 1570.8)\\ \\mathrm{m^{-1}} = 1570.8\\ \\mathrm{m^{-1}} $$\nSince $k_{\\min} > k_m$, the heater size is the limiting factor, and we expect an enhancement of the CHF relative to the infinite-plate case.\n\nFor comparison, let us first calculate the infinite-extent CHF, $q''_{\\mathrm{crit,Z}}$:\n$$ q''_{\\mathrm{crit,Z}} = (0.131) (8.8 \\times 10^4) (12.5)^{1/2} [ (9.81) (1.0 \\times 10^{-2}) (1667.5) ]^{1/4} $$\n$$ q''_{\\mathrm{crit,Z}} = (0.131) (8.8 \\times 10^4) (3.5355) [163.58]^{1/4} $$\n$$ q''_{\\mathrm{crit,Z}} = (40742.8) (3.578) \\approx 145800\\ \\mathrm{W\\,m^{-2}} = 0.146\\ \\mathrm{MW\\,m^{-2}} $$\nThis value represents the critical heat flux on a large, flat surface.\n\nNow, we calculate the corrected CHF for the $D=2\\ \\mathrm{mm}$ heater using the ratio:\n$$ q''_{\\mathrm{crit,D}} = q''_{\\mathrm{crit,Z}} \\sqrt{\\frac{k_{\\mathrm{eff}}}{k_m}} = (145800\\ \\mathrm{W\\,m^{-2}}) \\sqrt{\\frac{1570.8}{738.4}} $$\n$$ q''_{\\mathrm{crit,D}} = (145800\\ \\mathrm{W\\,m^{-2}}) \\sqrt{2.127} \\approx (145800\\ \\mathrm{W\\,m^{-2}}) (1.4585) $$\n$$ q''_{\\mathrm{crit,D}} \\approx 212670\\ \\mathrm{W\\,m^{-2}} \\approx 0.21267\\ \\mathrm{MW\\,m^{-2}} $$\nThe finite size of the heater forces the instability to a shorter wavelength (larger wavenumber), which can be sustained only by a higher vapor flux, thus increasing the CHF by approximately $46\\%$.\nThe problem requires the final answer expressed in $\\mathrm{MW\\,m^{-2}}$ and rounded to three significant figures.\n$$ q''_{\\mathrm{crit,D}} \\approx 0.213\\ \\mathrm{MW\\,m^{-2}} $$", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{0.213} $$", "id": "2475608"}, {"introduction": "Finally, we zoom into the microscopic scale to investigate the fundamental mechanism that counteracts the formation of insulating vapor films.

The objective is to find an expression for the rewetting speed $U$.\n\nFirst, we establish the driving force for the flow, which is the capillary-induced pressure gradient.
