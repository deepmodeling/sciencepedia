It is a standard problem in the study of boiling phenomena. I will proceed with the solution.\n\nThe problem requires a two-part derivation followed by a numerical calculation. The first part is to determine the vapor overpressure in the bubble, and the second is to estimate the minimum wall superheat required for the bubble to remain in equilibrium.\n\nThe equilibrium of a vapor bubble on a solid surface is governed by the balance of mechanical and thermal forces.\n\nFirst, consider mechanical equilibrium. The pressure difference across any curved liquid-vapor interface is described by the Young-Laplace equation:\n$$ p_v - p_{l,i} = \\sigma \\left( \\frac{1}{R_1} + \\frac{1}{R_2} \\right) $$\nwhere $p_v$ is the pressure inside the vapor bubble, $p_{l,i}$ is the pressure in the liquid immediately adjacent to the interface, $\\sigma$ is the surface tension, and $R_1$ and $R_2$ are the two principal radii of curvature of the interface.\n\nThe problem states that the bubble has the shape of a spherical cap with a spherical radius of curvature $R$. For any point on the surface of a sphere, the two principal radii of curvature are equal to the radius of the sphere. Therefore, we have $R_1 = R_2 = R$. The Young-Laplace equation simplifies to:\n$$ p_v - p_{l,i} = \\frac{2\\sigma}{R} $$\nThe liquid is specified as quiescent, and gravitational effects are negligible. This implies that the pressure within the liquid is uniform. The liquid far from the bubble is at the saturation pressure $p_{\\mathrm{sat}}$ corresponding to the saturation temperature $T_{\\mathrm{sat}}$. Thus, the pressure in the liquid at the interface is equal to the ambient pressure: $p_{l,i} = p_{\\mathrm{sat}}(T_{\\mathrm{sat}})$.\n\nThe curvature-induced vapor overpressure, which is the pressure difference between the vapor in the bubble and the ambient liquid, is therefore:\n$$ p_v - p_{\\mathrm{sat}}(T_{\\mathrm{sat}}) = \\frac{2\\sigma}{R} $$\nThis expression gives the overpressure required for mechanical equilibrium. It is important to note that this result depends only on the given spherical radius of curvature $R$ and the surface tension $\\sigma$. The contact angle $\\theta$ defines the geometry of the cap (i.e., its height and base radius for a given $R$), but it does not alter the curvature of the spherical interface itself. Thus, for a given $R$, the pressure difference is independent of $\\theta$.\n\nNext, consider thermal equilibrium. The problem states that the interface is locally at thermodynamic equilibrium. This requires that the vapor pressure inside the bubble, $p_v$, must be equal to the saturation pressure corresponding to the temperature of the interface, $T_i$.\n$$ p_v = p_{\\mathrm{sat}}(T_i) $$\nFurthermore, we are given the simplifying assumption that the interface temperature is equal to the temperature of the isothermal wall, $T_w$.\n$$ T_i = T_w $$\nCombining these two thermal conditions, we have:\n$$ p_v = p_{\\mathrm{sat}}(T_w) $$\nNow, we equate the expression for $p_v$ from thermal equilibrium with the one derived from mechanical equilibrium:\n$$ p_{\\mathrm{sat}}(T_w) - p_{\\mathrm{sat}}(T_{\\mathrm{sat}}) = \\frac{2\\sigma}{R} $$\nThe left-hand side of this equation represents the increase in saturation pressure due to the wall superheat, $\\Delta T_w = T_w - T_{\\mathrm{sat}}$. The problem instructs us to use a first-order Taylor series expansion of the function $p_{\\mathrm{sat}}(T)$ about the temperature $T_{\\mathrm{sat}}$ to approximate this pressure difference.\n$$ p_{\\mathrm{sat}}(T_w) \\approx p_{\\mathrm{sat}}(T_{\\mathrm{sat}}) + \\left. \\frac{dp_{\\mathrm{sat}}}{dT} \\right|_{T=T_{\\mathrm{sat}}} (T_w - T_{\\mathrm{sat}}) $$\nRearranging gives the pressure change:\n$$ p_{\\mathrm{sat}}(T_w) - p_{\\mathrm{sat}}(T_{\\mathrm{sat}}) \\approx \\left. \\frac{dp_{\\mathrm{sat}}}{dT} \\right|_{T_{\\mathrm{sat}}} \\Delta T_w $$\nThis linear relationship is an approximation based on the Clausius-Clapeyron equation. Substituting this into our combined equilibrium equation yields:\n$$ \\left. \\frac{dp_{\\mathrm{sat}}}{dT} \\right|_{T_{\\mathrm{sat}}} \\Delta T_w = \\frac{2\\sigma}{R} $$\nSolving for the minimum required wall superheat, $\\Delta T_w$, we obtain the final analytical expression:\n$$ \\Delta T_w = \\frac{2\\sigma}{R \\left( \\left. \\frac{dp_{\\mathrm{sat}}}{dT} \\right|_{T_{\\mathrm{sat}}} \\right)} $$\nThis equation shows that a smaller radius of curvature $R$ requires a larger superheat $\\Delta T_w$ to maintain an equilibrium bubble, a fundamental concept in nucleation theory.\n\nFinally, we evaluate this expression using the provided data:\n- Surface tension: $\\sigma = 5.89 \\times 10^{-2}\\ \\mathrm{N/m}$\n- Spherical radius of curvature: $R = 5.00 \\times 10^{-6}\\ \\mathrm{m}$\n- Saturation-curve slope: $\\left.\\dfrac{dp_{\\mathrm{sat}}}{dT}\\right|_{T_{\\mathrm{sat}}} = 3.60 \\times 10^{3}\\ \\mathrm{Pa/K}$\n\nSubstituting these values into our derived formula:\n$$ \\Delta T_w = \\frac{2 \\times (5.89 \\times 10^{-2})}{(5.00 \\times 10^{-6}) \\times (3.60 \\times 10^{3})} $$\n$$ \\Delta T_w = \\frac{1.178 \\times 10^{-1}}{18.0 \\times 10^{-3}} = \\frac{0.1178}{0.018} $$\n$$ \\Delta T_w \\approx 6.5444... \\ \\mathrm{K} $$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures.

It is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and contains all necessary information for a complete solution. Therefore, it is deemed a valid problem.\n\nThe solution proceeds in two parts. First, the required scaling law is derived from fundamental principles as instructed. Second, the provided experimental data are used to compute a least-squares estimate for the dimensionless constant in the derived model.\n\n**Part 1: Theoretical Derivation**\n\nWe begin with the principle of conservation of energy applied to a unit area of the heated plate. The problem states that the heat flux from the plate, denoted by $q''$ (with units of W/m$^2$ or J s$^{-1}$ m$^{-2}$), is the source of energy. This energy is transferred to the fluid. Idealization (ii) specifies that sensible heating and microlayer contributions are negligible. Therefore, all heat supplied by the plate is consumed as latent heat of vaporization to form vapor bubbles.\n\nThe rate of vapor mass generated per unit area of the plate is denoted as $\\dot{m}''$. The energy required to generate this mass of vapor is given by the product of the mass flow rate and the latent heat of vaporization, $h_{fg}$. By conservation of energy:\n$$q'' = \\dot{m}'' h_{fg}$$\nThis equation establishes that the plate heat flux $q''$ is directly proportional to the rate of vapor mass production per unit area, $\\dot{m}''$. Rearranging for $\\dot{m}''$ gives:\n$$\\dot{m}'' = \\frac{q''}{h_{fg}}$$\n\nNext, we construct a model for $\\dot{m}''$ based on the bubble dynamics described. The plate has an active nucleation site density of $N_a$ sites per unit area. From each site, vapor bubbles are emitted with a frequency $f$. According to idealization (i) and (iii), each bubble is a perfect sphere with a departure diameter $d_b$. The volume of a single bubble, $V_b$, is therefore:\n$$V_b = \\frac{1}{6}\\pi d_b^3$$\nThe mass of a single bubble, $m_b$, is the product of its volume and the vapor density, $\\rho_v$:\n$$m_b = \\rho_v V_b = \\rho_v \\left(\\frac{1}{6}\\pi d_b^3\\right)$$\nThe rate of mass production from a single nucleation site is the product of the mass per bubble and the bubble departure frequency, $m_b f$. The total rate of mass production per unit area of the plate, $\\dot{m}''$, is this single-site rate multiplied by the number of sites per unit area, $N_a$:\n$$\\dot{m}'' = N_a (m_b f) = N_a f \\rho_v \\left(\\frac{1}{6}\\pi d_b^3\\right)$$\n\nWe now equate the two expressions for $\\dot{m}''$:\n$$\\frac{q''}{h_{fg}} = N_a f \\rho_v \\left(\\frac{1}{6}\\pi d_b^3\\right)$$\nSolving this equation for the bubble departure frequency, $f$, yields:\n$$f = \\left(\\frac{6}{\\pi}\\right) \\frac{q''}{N_a \\rho_v h_{fg} d_b^3}$$\nThis result shows the required scaling, $f \\sim \\frac{q''}{N_a \\,\\rho_v \\, h_{fg} \\, d_b^3}$. The theoretical dimensionless proportionality constant, based on the idealizations, is $C_{theory} = \\frac{6}{\\pi} \\approx 1.90986$.\n\n**Part 2: Empirical Determination of the Constant**\n\nThe problem requires fitting the experimental data to a no-intercept linear model of the form:\n$$f = C \\cdot X$$\nwhere the independent variable $X$ is the group:\n$$X = \\frac{q''}{N_a \\rho_v h_{fg} d_b^3}$$\nand the dependent variable is the measured frequency $f_i$. For a set of $n$ data points $(X_i, f_i)$, the least-squares estimate for the constant $C$ that minimizes the sum of squared residuals is given by:\n$$C = \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{n} X_i f_i}{\\sum_{i=1}^{n} X_i^2}$$\nWe are given $n=3$ data points and the following constants:\n$h_{fg} = 2.257 \\times 10^{6}$ J/kg\n$\\rho_v = 0.597$ kg/m$^{3}$\n$N_a = 6.0 \\times 10^{6}$ m$^{-2}$\n\nFirst, we calculate the values of $X_i$ for each of the three experimental runs.

We use the derived expression for $x(z)$ and solve for $z = z_{\\text{do}}$:\n$$ x_{\\text{do}} = \\frac{1}{h_{fg}} \\left( \\frac{4 q^{\\prime\\prime}}{G D} z_{\\text{do}} - c_{p,\\ell} \\Delta T_{\\text{sub,in}} \\right) $$\nRearranging to solve for $z_{\\text{do}}$:\n$$ x_{\\text{do}} h_{fg} + c_{p,\\ell} \\Delta T_{\\text{sub,in}} = \\frac{4 q^{\\prime\\prime}}{G D} z_{\\text{do}} $$\n$$ z_{\\text{do}} = \\frac{G D}{4 q^{\\prime\\prime}} (x_{\\text{do}} h_{fg} + c_{p,\\ell} \\Delta T_{\\text{sub,in}}) $$\nThis is the analytical solution derived from first principles.
