The change in interfacial free energy per unit contact-line length is the sum of contributions from the solid and the liquid–vapor interfaces.

The onset of motion is determined by a force balance. At the critical angle, the component of the gravitational force acting parallel to the inclined plate and in the downslope direction equals the maximum static resisting force due to contact line pinning.\n\nThe driving force, $F_D$, is the component of gravity parallel to the surface:\n$$F_D = mg \\sin(\\alpha)$$\nwhere $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity and $\\alpha$ is the tilt angle.\n\nThe resisting force, $F_R$, is the capillary force arising from contact angle hysteresis.

The net force the droplet exerts on the solid is $F_{d \\to s} = w \\gamma_{lv}\\cos(\\theta_a) - w \\gamma_{lv}\\cos(\\theta_r)$. The force exerted by the solid on the droplet, which is the resisting force $F_R$, is the negative of this:\n$$F_R = -F_{d \\to s} = -(w \\gamma_{lv}\\cos(\\theta_a) - w \\gamma_{lv}\\cos(\\theta_r)) = w \\gamma_{lv}(\\cos(\\theta_r) - \\cos(\\theta_a))$$\nSince it is given that $\\theta_a  \\theta_r$, we have $\\cos(\\theta_r)  \\cos(\\theta_a)$.

Shedding occurs when a growing droplet on a surface with a fixed tilt angle $\\alpha$ reaches a critical mass, $m_c$.

Here, $\\rho$ is the liquid density, and $c_v$ and $\\kappa$ are dimensionless constants. Substituting these into the critical condition:\n$$(\\rho c_v R_c^3) g \\sin(\\alpha) \\sim (\\kappa R_c) \\gamma_{lv}(\\cos(\\theta_r) - \\cos(\\theta_a))$$\nwhere $R_c$ is the critical radius for shedding.

Specifically, for a small $\\Delta\\theta$, a Taylor series expansion gives $\\cos(\\theta_a) \\approx \\cos(\\theta_r) - \\Delta\\theta \\sin(\\theta_r)$, so $(\\cos(\\theta_r) - \\cos(\\theta_a)) \\approx \\Delta\\theta \\sin(\\theta_r)$. In general, as $\\Delta\\theta$ increases, the term $(\\cos(\\theta_r) - \\cos(\\theta_a))$ also increases, signifying a larger pinning force.\n\nFrom the derived scaling, $f_{shed} \\propto (\\cos(\\theta_r) - \\cos(\\theta_a))^{-3/2}$. This shows a strong inverse relationship between shedding frequency and the magnitude of the capillary retention force.\n\nIn conclusion, an increase in the magnitude of contact angle hysteresis, $\\Delta\\theta$, results in a larger retaining force for any given droplet size. Consequently, the droplet must grow to a larger critical mass and volume ($V_c$) before the gravitational driving force is sufficient to overcome this pinning. For a constant volumetric growth rate, attaining this larger critical volume requires a longer time ($T_{shed}$). A longer shedding period corresponds to a lower shedding frequency ($f_{shed}$). Therefore, higher contact angle hysteresis suppresses droplet mobility and significantly reduces the frequency of condensate shedding.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\arcsin\\left(\\frac{w \\gamma_{lv}}{mg}\\left(\\cos(\\theta_r) - \\cos(\\theta_a)\\right)\\right)}$$", "id": "2527876"}]}
