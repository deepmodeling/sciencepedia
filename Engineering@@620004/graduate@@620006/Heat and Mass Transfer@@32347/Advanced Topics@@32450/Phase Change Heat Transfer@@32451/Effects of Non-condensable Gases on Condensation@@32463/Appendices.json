It is objective.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is **valid** as it is scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and self-contained. A full, reasoned solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution and Derivation\n\n**Part 1: Derivation and Evaluation of $x_{nc,i}$**\n\nThe mole fraction of any component in an ideal gas mixture is defined as the ratio of its partial pressure to the total pressure. For the non-condensable gas at the interface (denoted by subscript $i$), its mole fraction $x_{nc,i}$ is:\n$$\nx_{nc,i} = \\frac{p_{nc,i}}{P}\n$$\nwhere $p_{nc,i}$ is the partial pressure of the non-condensable gas at the interface and $P$ is the total pressure.\n\nAccording to Dalton's law of additive pressures, the total pressure at the interface is the sum of the partial pressures of the components. For the binary mixture of vapor (subscript $v$) and non-condensable gas (subscript $nc$), we have:\n$$\nP = p_{v,i} + p_{nc,i}\n$$\n\nFrom this, the partial pressure of the non-condensable gas at the interface can be expressed as:\n$$\np_{nc,i} = P - p_{v,i}\n$$\n\nThe problem states that the vapor at the interface is in local thermodynamic equilibrium with the pure liquid water. This dictates that the partial pressure of the vapor at the interface, $p_{v,i}$, must be equal to the saturation pressure of the water at the interfacial temperature, $T_i$.\n$$\np_{v,i} = p_{\\text{sat}}(T_i)\n$$\n\nSubstituting this equilibrium condition into the expression for $p_{nc,i}$ yields:\n$$\np_{nc,i} = P - p_{\\text{sat}}(T_i)\n$$\n\nFinally, substituting this result into the definition of the mole fraction $x_{nc,i}$ gives the desired expression:\n$$\nx_{nc,i} = \\frac{P - p_{\\text{sat}}(T_i)}{P} = 1 - \\frac{p_{\\text{sat}}(T_i)}{P}\n$$\n\nTo evaluate this expression numerically, we first calculate the saturation pressure $p_{\\text{sat}}$ at the given interfacial temperature $T_i = 320.0 \\,\\text{K}$ using the provided correlation.\n$$\n\\ln(p_{\\text{sat}}) = 23.1964 - \\frac{3816.44}{320.0 - 46.13}\n$$\n$$\n\\ln(p_{\\text{sat}}) = 23.1964 - \\frac{3816.44}{273.87} = 23.1964 - 13.935517...\n$$\n$$\n\\ln(p_{\\text{sat}}) = 9.260883...\n$$\nExponentiating both sides gives the saturation pressure in Pascals:\n$$\np_{\\text{sat}}(320.0 \\,\\text{K}) = \\exp(9.260883...) = 10515.63... \\,\\text{Pa}\n$$\n\nThe total pressure is given as $P = 101.325 \\,\\text{kPa} = 101325 \\,\\text{Pa}$. Now, we can calculate $x_{nc,i}$:\n$$\nx_{nc,i} = 1 - \\frac{10515.63...}{101325} = 1 - 0.103781...\n$$\n$$\nx_{nc,i} = 0.896218...\n$$\nRounding to four significant figures, the interfacial mole fraction of the non-condensable gas is $0.8962$.\n\n**Part 2: Influence of $x_{nc,i}$ on Mass Transfer Resistance**\n\nThe presence of a non-condensable gas introduces a significant mass transfer resistance on the gas side, which often becomes the limiting factor for the condensation rate. This phenomenon is explained by the binary-film model.\n\nAs vapor condenses at the liquid-gas interface, it is removed from the gas phase. The non-condensable gas, which does not condense, is carried toward the interface by the bulk motion of the gas (convection, or Stefan flow). Since it cannot pass through the interface, its concentration builds up, creating a layer rich in the non-condensable gas. The mole fraction of the non-condensable gas at the interface, $x_{nc,i}$, becomes greater than its mole fraction in the bulk gas, $x_{nc,\\infty}$. In this case, $x_{nc,i} \\approx 0.8962$ while $x_{nc,\\infty} = 0.80$.\n\nFor condensation to continue, vapor must diffuse through this stagnant, non-condensable-rich layer. The rate of this process is governed by Fick's law of diffusion, modified to account for the bulk flow. For a one-dimensional steady diffusion of vapor (species $v$) through a stagnant non-condensable gas (species $nc$), the molar flux of vapor, $\\dot{n}_v''$, is given by:\n$$\n\\dot{n}_v'' = \\frac{c D_{v, nc}}{\\delta} \\ln\\left(\\frac{x_{nc,i}}{x_{nc,\\infty}}\\right)\n$$\nwhere $c$ is the total molar concentration of the gas mixture, $D_{v, nc}$ is the binary diffusion coefficient, and $\\delta$ is the thickness of the diffusion layer.\n\nThe part of this molar flux expression that is fundamentally altered by the presence of the non-condensable gas is the logarithmic term, $\\ln(x_{nc,i} / x_{nc,\\infty})$. This term arises directly from the integration of the species transport equation that includes both diffusion and Stefan flow, under the condition that the net flux of the non-condensable gas is zero.\n\nThe magnitude of $x_{nc,i}$, which is determined by the interfacial temperature and total pressure, directly influences the magnitude of this logarithmic term. This term acts as the effective driving potential for mass transfer in this formulation. If there were no non-condensable gas ($x_{nc,i} \\to 0$ and $x_{nc,\\infty} \\to 0$), this model would predict an infinite flux, correctly indicating that the gas-side mass transfer resistance disappears and the process becomes limited solely by heat transfer through the liquid film.\n\nTherefore, the accumulation of the non-condensable gas at the interface, quantified by the mole fraction $x_{nc,i}$, creates a diffusion barrier. The resistance to mass transfer is embodied in the relationship between the flux and the concentrations. The greater the accumulation (i.e., the larger the ratio $x_{nc,i}/x_{nc,\\infty}$), the larger the effective driving potential appears in this form, but it is precisely this accumulation that constitutes the resistance. A more formal definition of resistance shows that it increases with the mean concentration of the non-condensable gas in the film. The key is that the entire physical mechanism of mass transfer is changed, a change captured by the logarithmic term in the flux equation which depends explicitly on $x_{nc,i}$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{0.8962}\n$$", "id": "2481134"}, {"introduction": "Having established how a layer of non-condensable gas forms, we now turn to quantifying its impact on the condensation rate.

It does not violate any fundamental principles and the given data are physically consistent for the specified cryogenic conditions.\n\nStep 3: Verdict and Action.\nThe problem is deemed valid. A full, reasoned solution will be provided.\n\nThe analysis begins with the combined molar flux of species $A$ (nitrogen) in a one-dimensional system (coordinate $y$ normal to the plate, with $y=0$ at the wall). The total molar flux, $N_{A,y}$, is the sum of the diffusive flux given by Fick's law and the advective flux due to bulk motion (Stefan flow):\n$$N_{A,y} = -c D_{AB} \\frac{dx_A}{dy} + x_A (N_{A,y} + N_{B,y})$$\nHere, $c$ is the total molar concentration, $D_{AB}$ is the binary diffusivity, and $x_A$ is the mole fraction of species $A$. $N_{B,y}$ is the molar flux of the non-condensable gas (NCG), species $B$. A critical condition given is that the NCG does not cross the interface and is stagnant, meaning its net molar flux is zero:\n$$N_{B,y} = 0$$\nSubstituting this condition into the flux equation for species $A$ yields:\n$$N_{A,y} = -c D_{AB} \\frac{dx_A}{dy} + x_A N_{A,y}$$\nThis equation is rearranged to separate the variables $x_A$ and $y$:\n$$N_{A,y}(1 - x_A) = -c D_{AB} \\frac{dx_A}{dy}$$\n$$N_{A,y} \\, dy = -\\frac{c D_{AB}}{1 - x_A} \\, dx_A$$\nFor a steady-state process, the molar flux $N_{A,y}$ is constant throughout the film. The properties $c$ and $D_{AB}$ are also assumed constant. We can integrate this differential equation across the stagnant film, from the wall at $y=0$ to the edge of the film at $y=\\delta$:\n$$\\int_{0}^{\\delta} N_{A,y} \\, dy = - \\int_{x_{A,w}}^{x_{A,\\infty}} \\frac{c D_{AB}}{1 - x_A} \\, dx_A$$\nwhere $x_{A,w}$ is the mole fraction of species $A$ at the wall ($y=0$), and $x_{A,\\infty}$ is the mole fraction in the bulk ($y=\\delta$).\n$$N_{A,y} [\\delta - 0] = -c D_{AB} [-\\ln(1 - x_A)]_{x_{A,w}}^{x_{A,\\infty}}$$\n$$N_{A,y} \\delta = c D_{AB} [\\ln(1 - x_{A,\\infty}) - \\ln(1 - x_{A,w})]$$\n$$N_{A,y} = \\frac{c D_{AB}}{\\delta} \\ln\\left(\\frac{1 - x_{A,\\infty}}{1 - x_{A,w}}\\right)$$\nNitrogen vapor condenses from the bulk onto the cold plate, so its flux is directed toward the wall (in the negative $y$ direction). We define the magnitude of the condensation flux as $N_A = -N_{A,y}$:\n$$N_A = -\\frac{c D_{AB}}{\\delta} \\ln\\left(\\frac{1 - x_{A,\\infty}}{1 - x_{A,w}}\\right) = \\frac{c D_{AB}}{\\delta} \\ln\\left(\\frac{1 - x_{A,w}}{1 - x_{A,\\infty}}\\right)$$\nThis is the required expression for the molar flux of nitrogen vapor toward the wall.\n\nFor an ideal gas mixture, the mole fraction of a species is equal to the ratio of its partial pressure to the total pressure, $x_i = p_i/P$. The problem states that the gas is saturated at the interface and in the bulk.\nThe bulk mole fraction of nitrogen is:\n$$x_{A,\\infty} = \\frac{p_{\\mathrm{sat},A}(T_{\\infty})}{P} = \\frac{0.60 P}{P} = 0.60$$\nThe wall mole fraction of nitrogen is:\n$$x_{A,w} = \\frac{p_{\\mathrm{sat},A}(T_{w})}{P} = \\frac{0.20 P}{P} = 0.20$$\nThe problem asks for the mass flux, $m''$, which is the molar flux multiplied by the molar mass, $M_A$:\n$$m'' = N_A M_A = \\frac{M_A c D_{AB}}{\\delta} \\ln\\left(\\frac{1 - x_{A,w}}{1 - x_{A,\\infty}}\\right)$$\nThe logarithmic term is common to both the helium and air cases:\n$$\\ln\\left(\\frac{1 - x_{A,w}}{1 - x_{A,\\infty}}\\right) = \\ln\\left(\\frac{1 - 0.20}{1 - 0.60}\\right) = \\ln\\left(\\frac{0.80}{0.40}\\right) = \\ln(2)$$\nThus, the mass flux expression simplifies to:\n$$m'' = \\frac{M_A c D_{AB}}{\\delta} \\ln(2)$$\nWe must now compute the ratio $r = m''_{\\mathrm{He}} / m''_{\\mathrm{air}}$.\nFor the helium case:\n$$m''_{\\mathrm{He}} = \\frac{M_A c D_{AB}^{(\\mathrm{He})}}{\\delta} \\ln(2)$$\nFor the air case:\n$$m''_{\\mathrm{air}} = \\frac{M_A c D_{AB}^{(\\mathrm{air})}}{\\delta} \\ln(2)$$\nThe problem states that all conditions are identical except for the NCG, which implies that $M_A$, $c$, and $\\delta$ are the same for both cases.\nThe ratio $r$ is therefore:\n$$r = \\frac{m''_{\\mathrm{He}}}{m''_{\\mathrm{air}}} = \\frac{\\frac{M_A c D_{AB}^{(\\mathrm{He})}}{\\delta} \\ln(2)}{\\frac{M_A c D_{AB}^{(\\mathrm{air})}}{\\delta} \\ln(2)}$$\nAll terms cancel out except for the diffusivities:\n$$r = \\frac{D_{AB}^{(\\mathrm{He})}}{D_{AB}^{(\\mathrm{air})}}$$\nNow, substitute the given numerical values for the diffusivities:\n$$D_{AB}^{(\\mathrm{He})} = 1.00 \\times 10^{-5}\\ \\mathrm{m}^{2}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$$\n$$D_{AB}^{(\\mathrm{air})} = 4.00 \\times 10^{-6}\\ \\mathrm{m}^{2}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$$\n$$r = \\frac{1.00 \\times 10^{-5}}{4.00 \\times 10^{-6}} = \\frac{1.00}{0.400} = 2.5$$\nThe given diffusivities have three significant figures.

For example: \"[$p_A,p_B,p_C,p_D$]\".", "solution": "The problem is well-posed, scientifically grounded, and provides sufficient information to construct a valid physical model. We proceed to the solution.\n\nThe objective is to derive an expression for the transient partial pressure of the non-condensable species, $p_{\\text{nc}}(t)$, within the control volume. The derivation begins from the provided species conservation equation for the non-condensable gas.\n\nThe molar balance for the non-condensable species is given by:\n$$\n\\frac{d n_{\\text{nc}}}{dt} = N_{\\text{in}} x_{\\text{nc,in}} - N_{\\text{purge}}(t)\\, y_{\\text{nc}}(t)\n$$\nwhere $n_{\\text{nc}}$ is the number of moles of the non-condensable species in the control volume, $N_{\\text{in}}$ is the total molar flow rate into the volume, $x_{\\text{nc,in}}$ is the mole fraction of the non-condensable species in the inlet stream, $N_{\\text{purge}}(t)$ is the total molar purge rate, and $y_{\\text{nc}}(t)$ is the mole fraction of the non-condensable species inside the control volume.\n\nAccording to the Ideal Gas Law applied to the non-condensable species, its partial pressure $p_{\\text{nc}}(t)$ is related to the number of moles $n_{\\text{nc}}(t)$ by:\n$$\np_{\\text{nc}}(t) V = n_{\\text{nc}}(t) R T\n$$\nSince the volume $V$, gas constant $R$, and temperature $T$ are constant, we can differentiate this expression with respect to time $t$ to relate the rate of change of moles to the rate of change of partial pressure:\n$$\n\\frac{d n_{\\text{nc}}}{dt} = \\frac{V}{R T} \\frac{d p_{\\text{nc}}}{dt}\n$$\nSubstituting this into the molar balance equation gives:\n$$\n\\frac{V}{R T} \\frac{d p_{\\text{nc}}}{dt} = N_{\\text{in}} x_{\\text{nc,in}} - N_{\\text{purge}}(t)\\, y_{\\text{nc}}(t)\n$$\nThe problem states that the molar purge rate is $N_{\\text{purge}}(t) = Q P(t)/(R T)$, where $Q$ is the constant volumetric purge rate and $P(t)$ is the total pressure in the control volume at time $t$. Dalton's law states that the mole fraction is the ratio of partial pressure to total pressure, $y_{\\text{nc}}(t) = p_{\\text{nc}}(t) / P(t)$. We substitute these expressions into the equation:\n$$\n\\frac{V}{R T} \\frac{d p_{\\text{nc}}}{dt} = N_{\\text{in}} x_{\\text{nc,in}} - \\left( \\frac{Q P(t)}{R T} \\right) \\left( \\frac{p_{\\text{nc}}(t)}{P(t)} \\right)\n$$\nA crucial simplification occurs as the total pressure $P(t)$ cancels out from the purge term:\n$$\n\\frac{V}{R T} \\frac{d p_{\\text{nc}}}{dt} = N_{\\text{in}} x_{\\text{nc,in}} - \\frac{Q}{R T} p_{\\text{nc}}(t)\n$$\nTo isolate the derivative of $p_{\\text{nc}}(t)$, we multiply the entire equation by $R T / V$:\n$$\n\\frac{d p_{\\text{nc}}}{dt} = \\frac{R T}{V} N_{\\text{in}} x_{\\text{nc,in}} - \\frac{Q}{V} p_{\\text{nc}}(t)\n$$\nRearranging this into the standard form for a first-order linear ordinary differential equation (ODE), we obtain:\n$$\n\\frac{d p_{\\text{nc}}}{dt} + \\left( \\frac{Q}{V} \\right) p_{\\text{nc}}(t) = \\frac{R T N_{\\text{in}} x_{\\text{nc,in}}}{V}\n$$\nThis ODE can be solved analytically. We consider two distinct cases based on the value of the purge rate $Q$.\n\nCase 1: $Q  0$\nThe ODE is of the form $y' + ay = b$, with $p_{\\text{nc}}$ as $y$, $a = Q/V$, and $b = (R T N_{\\text{in}} x_{\\text{nc,in}})/V$. The general solution is:\n$$\np_{\\text{nc}}(t) = \\frac{b}{a} + C e^{-at}\n$$\nwhere $C$ is a constant of integration. Substituting for $a$ and $b$:\n$$\n\\frac{b}{a} = \\frac{(R T N_{\\text{in}} x_{\\text{nc,in}})/V}{Q/V} = \\frac{R T N_{\\text{in}} x_{\\text{nc,in}}}{Q}\n$$\nThis term represents the steady-state partial pressure, $p_{\\text{nc,ss}}$, which is reached as $t \\to \\infty$. The solution becomes:\n$$\np_{\\text{nc}}(t) = p_{\\text{nc,ss}} + C e^{-(Q/V)t}\n$$\nThe constant $C$ is determined from the initial condition. At $t=0$, the partial pressure is $p_{\\text{nc}}(0) = p_{\\text{nc},0} = y_{\\text{nc},0} P_0$.\n$$\np_{\\text{nc},0} = p_{\\text{nc,ss}} + C e^{0} \\implies C = p_{\\text{nc},0} - p_{\\text{nc,ss}}\n$$\nSubstituting $C$ back, the final solution for $p_{\\text{nc}}(t)$ for $Q  0$ is:\n$$\np_{\\text{nc}}(t) = p_{\\text{nc,ss}} + (p_{\\text{nc},0} - p_{\\text{nc,ss}}) e^{-(Q/V)t}\n$$\nwhere $p_{\\text{nc,ss}} = \\frac{R T N_{\\text{in}} x_{\\text{nc,in}}}{Q}$ and $p_{\\text{nc},0} = y_{\\text{nc},0} P_0$.\n\nCase 2: $Q = 0$\nWhen there is no purge, the ODE simplifies to:\n$$\n\\frac{d p_{\\text{nc}}}{dt} = \\frac{R T N_{\\text{in}} x_{\\text{nc,in}}}{V}\n$$\nThe right-hand side is a constant. Integrating with respect to time from $0$ to $t$:\n$$\n\\int_{p_{\\text{nc},0}}^{p_{\\text{nc}}(t)} d p'_{\\text{nc}} = \\int_{0}^{t} \\frac{R T N_{\\text{in}} x_{\\text{nc,in}}}{V} d\\tau\n$$\nThis yields a linear relationship for the partial pressure accumulation:\n$$\np_{\\text{nc}}(t) - p_{\\text{nc},0} = \\left( \\frac{R T N_{\\text{in}} x_{\\text{nc,in}}}{V} \\right) t\n$$\n$$\np_{\\text{nc}}(t) = p_{\\text{nc},0} + \\left( \\frac{R T N_{\\text{in}} x_{\\text{nc,in}}}{V} \\right) t\n$$\nwhere again $p_{\\text{nc},0} = y_{\\text{nc},0} P_0$.\n\nThese derived analytical solutions will be implemented to compute the final partial pressure $p_{\\text{nc}}(t_f)$ for each test case. Note that the parameter $N_{\\text{cond}}$ does not appear in the final equation for $p_{\\text{nc}}(t)$, demonstrating that under the given model assumptions, the dynamics of the non-condensable species are decoupled from the condensation process.
