The analysis proceeds by first establishing the correct thermodynamic expression for the heat released during condensation of a non-ideal binary mixture and then comparing this to the simplified approximation proposed by the engineer.\n\nFirst, let us establish the notation. The total molar condensation flux is $N''$, and the molar fluxes of species $A$ and $B$ are $N_{A}''$ and $N_{B}''$, respectively, such that $N'' = N_{A}'' + N_{B}''$. The problem states that the total molar flux is $N'' = 0.200$ mol m$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$. For steady-state condensation, the composition of the material crossing the vapor-liquid interface must be identical to the composition of the liquid being formed. The interfacial liquid composition is given as $x_{A} = 0.40$ and $x_{B} = 0.60$. Therefore, the molar fluxes of the individual components are $N_{A}'' = x_{A} N''$ and $N_{B}'' = x_{B} N''$.\n\nThe true local heat flux released to the wall, $q''_{\\text{true}}$, is determined by an enthalpy balance at the interface. Neglecting sensible heat effects, the heat flux is the difference between the enthalpy flux of the condensing vapor and the enthalpy flux of the produced liquid condensate:\n$$\nq''_{\\text{true}} = (N_{A}'' \\bar{H}_{A,v} + N_{B}'' \\bar{H}_{B,v}) - (N_{A}'' + N_{B}'') \\bar{H}_{L}\n$$\nwhere $\\bar{H}_{i,v}$ is the partial molar enthalpy of species $i$ in the vapor phase at the interface temperature $T_{i}$, and $\\bar{H}_{L}$ is the molar enthalpy of the liquid mixture at composition $(x_{A}, x_{B})$ and temperature $T_{i}$.\n\nSubstituting the expressions for the component fluxes:\n$$\nq''_{\\text{true}} = (x_{A} N'' \\bar{H}_{A,v} + x_{B} N'' \\bar{H}_{B,v}) - N'' \\bar{H}_{L} = N'' \\left[ (x_{A} \\bar{H}_{A,v} + x_{B} \\bar{H}_{B,v}) - \\bar{H}_{L} \\right]\n$$\nThe term $(x_{A} \\bar{H}_{A,v} + x_{B} \\bar{H}_{B,v})$ represents the molar enthalpy of the vapor mixture, $\\bar{H}_{v}$. Thus, the quantity in the brackets is the molar enthalpy of condensation for the mixture, $\\Delta \\bar{H}_{\\text{cond,mix}} = \\bar{H}_{v} - \\bar{H}_{L}$.\n\nTo evaluate this enthalpy change, we utilize the fact that enthalpy is a state function by constructing a convenient thermodynamic path from the initial state (vapor mixture) to the final state (liquid mixture):\n1.  Unmix $1$ mole of vapor mixture at $T_{i}$ with composition $(x_{A}, x_{B})$ into $x_{A}$ moles of pure vapor $A$ and $x_{B}$ moles of pure vapor $B$, both at $T_{i}$. As the vapor phase is treated as an ideal gas, the enthalpy of mixing is zero. Therefore, the enthalpy of the vapor mixture is simply the mole-fraction-weighted average of the pure component enthalpies: $\\bar{H}_{v} = x_{A} H_{A,v}^{\\text{pure}} + x_{B} H_{B,v}^{\\text{pure}}$. The enthalpy change for this step is $\\Delta H_{1} = 0$.\n2.  Condense the pure components at $T_{i}$. The enthalpy change for condensing $x_{A}$ moles of $A$ and $x_{B}$ moles of $B$ is given by $\\Delta H_{2} = -x_{A} L_{A}^{\\text{sat}}(T_{i}) - x_{B} L_{B}^{\\text{sat}}(T_{i})$, where $L_{i}^{\\text{sat}}$ is the molar latent heat of condensation of pure species $i$.\n3.  Mix the $x_{A}$ moles of pure liquid $A$ and $x_{B}$ moles of pure liquid $B$ at $T_{i}$ to form $1$ mole of a non-ideal liquid mixture. The enthalpy change of this process is the molar heat of mixing, which is equal to the excess molar enthalpy, $H^{E}$. So, $\\Delta H_{3} = H^{E}(x_{A}, T_{i})$.\n\nThe total enthalpy change from the vapor mixture to the liquid mixture is $\\bar{H}_{L} - \\bar{H}_{v} = \\Delta H_{1} + \\Delta H_{2} + \\Delta H_{3}$.\n$$\n\\bar{H}_{L} - \\bar{H}_{v} = 0 - \\left[ x_{A} L_{A}^{\\text{sat}}(T_{i}) + x_{B} L_{B}^{\\text{sat}}(T_{i}) \\right] + H^{E}(x_{A}, T_{i})\n$$\nThe molar heat of condensation of the mixture, $\\Delta \\bar{H}_{\\text{cond,mix}} = \\bar{H}_{v} - \\bar{H}_{L}$, is therefore:\n$$\n\\Delta \\bar{H}_{\\text{cond,mix}} = x_{A} L_{A}^{\\text{sat}}(T_{i}) + x_{B} L_{B}^{\\text{sat}}(T_{i}) - H^{E}(x_{A}, T_{i})\n$$\nThe correct expression for the true local heat flux is:\n$$\nq''_{\\text{true}} = N'' \\left[ x_{A} L_{A}^{\\text{sat}}(T_{i}) + x_{B} L_{B}^{\\text{sat}}(T_{i}) - H^{E}(x_{A}, T_{i}) \\right]\n$$\nNow, we calculate the numerical values.

This positive error indicates that the engineer's approximation overestimates the true heat flux by approximately $20.6\\%$.

The accumulation of species $B$ at the interface creates a diffusive barrier that limits the condensation rate.

We proceed to the solution.\n\n### Derivation of Transition Criterion and Solution\n\nThe driving force for natural convection is the buoyancy term in the momentum equation, $g(\\rho_{\\infty} - \\rho)$. For a gas mixture whose density $\\rho$ depends on both temperature $T$ and composition, we use the Boussinesq approximation to linearize the density difference.\nThe density of an ideal binary gas mixture is given by $\\rho = \\frac{p M_{\\mathrm{mix}}}{R_u T}$, where $R_u=8.314\\ \\mathrm{J/(mol\\cdot K)}$ is the universal gas constant and $M_{\\mathrm{mix}}$ is the mixture molecular weight.\n$M_{\\mathrm{mix}} = y_v M_v + y_a M_a = y_v M_v + (1-y_v) M_a = M_a + y_v(M_v - M_a)$.\nThe density is a function of $T$ and $y_v$, $\\rho(T, y_v)$. The density variation is approximated as:\n$\\rho_{\\infty} - \\rho \\approx -\\left(\\frac{\\partial\\rho}{\\partial T}\\right)(T_{\\infty}-T) - \\left(\\frac{\\partial\\rho}{\\partial y_v}\\right)(y_{v,\\infty}-y_v)$.\nThis is more formally written as $\\rho_{\\infty} - \\rho \\approx \\rho [ \\beta_T(T - T_{\\infty}) + \\beta_y(y_v - y_{v,\\infty}) ]$. Using the wall as reference, the buoyancy force is driven by differences from the bulk: $g(\\rho_\\infty - \\rho_i) \\approx g\\rho_f [ \\beta_T(T_\\infty - T_i) + \\beta_y(y_{v,\\infty} - y_{v,i}) ]$, where coefficients are evaluated at a reference film state.\nThe thermal expansion coefficient is $\\beta_T = -\\frac{1}{\\rho}\\left(\\frac{\\partial\\rho}{\\partial T}\\right)_{y_v}$. For an ideal gas mixture $\\rho \\propto 1/T$, so $\\beta_T = 1/T$.\nThe solutal expansion coefficient is $\\beta_y = -\\frac{1}{\\rho}\\left(\\frac{\\partial\\rho}{\\partial y_v}\\right)_{T}$.\n$\\frac{\\partial\\rho}{\\partial y_v} = \\frac{p}{R_u T}(M_v - M_a) = \\frac{\\rho}{M_{\\mathrm{mix}}}(M_v - M_a)$.\nSo, $\\beta_y = -\\frac{1}{M_{\\mathrm{mix}}}(M_v - M_a) = \\frac{M_a - M_v}{M_{\\mathrm{mix}}}$.\n\nThe transition from laminar to turbulent flow is governed by a modified or effective Rayleigh number, $Ra_{\\mathrm{eff},L}$, which combines thermal and solutal effects:\n$$Ra_{\\mathrm{eff},L} = Gr_{\\mathrm{eff},L} Pr = \\frac{g[\\beta_T(T_{\\infty}-T_i) + \\beta_y(y_{v,\\infty}-y_{v,i})]L^3}{\\nu \\alpha}$$\nFor a vertical plate, the critical Rayleigh number for transition is $Ra_{\\mathrm{crit}} \\approx 10^9$.\n\nWe now calculate the required parameters.\n- Temperatures: $T_i = T_w = 40 + 273.15 = 313.15\\ \\mathrm{K}$. $T_{\\infty} = 80 + 273.15 = 353.15\\ \\mathrm{K}$.\n- Film temperature: $T_f = (T_i+T_{\\infty})/2 = (313.15+353.15)/2 = 333.15\\ \\mathrm{K}$ ($60^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$).\n- Temperature difference: $\\Delta T = T_{\\infty} - T_i = 40\\ \\mathrm{K}$.\n- Mole fractions: $y_{v,\\infty} = 0.20$. At the interface, $y_{v,i} = p_{\\mathrm{sat}}(40^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C})/p = 7.38\\ \\mathrm{kPa} / 101.3\\ \\mathrm{kPa} \\approx 0.07285$.\n- Mole fraction difference: $\\Delta y_v = y_{v,\\infty} - y_{v,i} = 0.20 - 0.07285 = 0.12715$.\n- Properties are evaluated at the film temperature $T_f$ and average film composition $y_{v,f} = (y_{v,\\infty}+y_{v,i})/2 = (0.20+0.07285)/2 \\approx 0.1364$.\n- Film mixture molecular weight: $M_{\\mathrm{mix},f} = M_a + y_{v,f}(M_v - M_a) = 0.02897 + 0.1364(0.01802 - 0.02897) \\approx 0.02747\\ \\mathrm{kg/mol}$.\n- Film density: $\\rho_f = \\frac{p M_{\\mathrm{mix},f}}{R_u T_f} = \\frac{101300\\ \\mathrm{Pa} \\times 0.02747\\ \\mathrm{kg/mol}}{8.314\\ \\mathrm{J/(mol\\cdot K)} \\times 333.15\\ \\mathrm{K}} \\approx 1.005\\ \\mathrm{kg/m^3}$.\n- Kinematic viscosity: $\\nu = \\mu/\\rho_f = (2.05 \\times 10^{-5}\\ \\mathrm{Pa\\cdot s})/(1.005\\ \\mathrm{kg/m^3}) \\approx 2.04 \\times 10^{-5}\\ \\mathrm{m^2/s}$.\n- Thermal diffusivity: $\\alpha = k/(\\rho_f c_p) = 0.028\\ \\mathrm{W/(m\\cdot K)} / (1.005\\ \\mathrm{kg/m^3} \\times 1020\\ \\mathrm{J/(kg\\cdot K)}) \\approx 2.73 \\times 10^{-5}\\ \\mathrm{m^2/s}$.\n- Expansion coefficients evaluated at film conditions:\n    - $\\beta_T = 1/T_f = 1/333.15\\ \\mathrm{K^{-1}} \\approx 0.00300\\ \\mathrm{K^{-1}}$.\n    - $\\beta_y = \\frac{M_a - M_v}{M_{\\mathrm{mix},f}} = \\frac{0.02897 - 0.01802}{0.02747} \\approx 0.4095$.\n\nThe total buoyancy driving term is $[\\beta_T \\Delta T + \\beta_y \\Delta y_v] = [0.00300 \\times 40 + 0.4095 \\times 0.12715] = [0.120 + 0.05207] \\approx 0.1721$.\nThe thermal contribution is $0.120$ and the solutal contribution is $0.05207$. They are of the same sign and comparable magnitude, so both must be included.\nNow, we calculate the effective Rayleigh number:\n$$Ra_{\\mathrm{eff},L} = \\frac{9.81\\ \\mathrm{m/s^2} \\times 0.1721 \\times (1.2\\ \\mathrm{m})^3}{(2.04 \\times 10^{-5}\\ \\mathrm{m^2/s})(2.73 \\times 10^{-5}\\ \\mathrm{m^2/s})} = \\frac{2.911}{5.569 \\times 10^{-10}} \\approx 5.23 \\times 10^9$$\nSince $Ra_{\\mathrm{eff},L} \\approx 5.23 \\times 10^9 > Ra_{\\mathrm{crit}} \\approx 10^9$, the flow in the gas-phase boundary layer is turbulent.\n\nNext, we quantify the effect on the heat transfer coefficient. The overall resistance is $1/U = 1/h_g + 1/h_\\ell$. The gas-side coefficient $h_g$ is calculated from the Nusselt number, $h_g = Nu_L k / L$.\n1.  **Hypothetical Laminar Flow**: Using a standard correlation for laminar flow, $Nu_L = 0.59 Ra_L^{1/4}$.\n    $Nu_{L,\\mathrm{lam}} = 0.59 \\times (5.23 \\times 10^9)^{1/4} = 0.59 \\times 269 \\approx 158.7$.\n    $h_{g,\\mathrm{lam}} = \\frac{158.7 \\times 0.028\\ \\mathrm{W/(m\\cdot K)}}{1.2\\ \\mathrm{m}} \\approx 3.70\\ \\mathrm{W/(m^2\\cdot K)}$.\n2.  **Turbulent Flow**: Using a standard correlation for turbulent flow, $Nu_L = 0.13 Ra_L^{1/3}$.\n    $Nu_{L,\\mathrm{turb}} = 0.13 \\times (5.23 \\times 10^9)^{1/3} = 0.13 \\times 1735 \\approx 225.6$.\n    $h_{g,\\mathrm{turb}} = \\frac{225.6 \\times 0.028\\ \\mathrm{W/(m\\cdot K)}}{1.2\\ \\mathrm{m}} \\approx 5.26\\ \\mathrm{W/(m^2\\cdot K)}$.\n\nNow, we calculate the overall coefficient $U$. Given $h_\\ell = 3000\\ \\mathrm{W/(m^2\\cdot K)}$.\nThe condensate film resistance is $R_\\ell = 1/h_\\ell = 1/3000 \\approx 3.33 \\times 10^{-4}\\ \\mathrm{(m^2\\cdot K)/W}$.\n- Laminar gas-side resistance: $R_{g,\\mathrm{lam}} = 1/h_{g,\\mathrm{lam}} = 1/3.70 \\approx 0.270\\ \\mathrm{(m^2\\cdot K)/W}$.\n- Turbulent gas-side resistance: $R_{g,\\mathrm{turb}} = 1/h_{g,\\mathrm{turb}} = 1/5.26 \\approx 0.190\\ \\mathrm{(m^2\\cdot K)/W}$.\nThe gas-side resistance is dominant in both cases ($R_g \\gg R_\\ell$).\n- $U_{\\mathrm{lam}} = 1/(R_{g,\\mathrm{lam}} + R_\\ell) = 1/(0.270+0.00033) \\approx 3.70\\ \\mathrm{W/(m^2\\cdot K)}$.\n- $U_{\\mathrm{turb}} = 1/(R_{g,\\mathrm{turb}} + R_\\ell) = 1/(0.190+0.00033) \\approx 5.25\\ \\mathrm{W/(m^2\\cdot K)}$.\nThe percentage increase in $U$ due to transition is:\n$\\frac{U_{\\mathrm{turb}} - U_{\\mathrm{lam}}}{U_{\\mathrm{lam}}} = \\frac{5.25-3.70}{3.70} \\approx 0.419$, which is a $42\\%$ increase.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. The appropriate transition criterion is a modified Rayleigh number $Ra_{\\mathrm{eff},L}=g\\,[\\beta_T\\,\\Delta T+\\beta_y\\,\\Delta y_v]\\,L^3/(\\nu\\,\\alpha)$, where $\\beta_T=1/T_f$ and $\\beta_y=M_{\\mathrm{mix}}(1/M_v-1/M_a)$ evaluated at film conditions, with critical $Ra_{\\mathrm{eff},L}\\sim 10^9$ for a vertical plate. For the given data, $Ra_{\\mathrm{eff},L}\\approx 5.5\\times 10^9$ (turbulent), the gas-side coefficient increases from about $3.3\\ \\mathrm{W/(m^2\\cdot K)}$ (if laminar) to about $4.9\\ \\mathrm{W/(m^2\\cdot K)}$ (turbulent), and the overall $U$ increases by roughly $50\\%$ because the gas film dominates the resistance.**\n- The principle of using a modified Rayleigh number is correct. The critical value $\\sim 10^9$ is correct.\n- The formula given for $\\beta_y$ is incorrect. It is the coefficient for mass fraction differences, $\\beta_w$, not mole fraction differences, $\\beta_y$. Using it with $\\Delta y_v$ is inconsistent.\n- However, all quantitative conclusions are remarkably consistent with my rigorous analysis. The calculated $Ra_{\\mathrm{eff},L} \\approx 5.5\\times 10^9$ is close to my value of $5.23 \\times 10^9$. The conclusion of turbulent flow is correct. The estimated heat transfer coefficients ($3.3$ and $4.9$) are close to my calculated values ($3.7$ and $5.26$). The statement that the gas film dominates resistance is correct. The final increase in $U$ of \"roughly $50\\%$\" is close to my calculated $42\\%$.\nDespite a formulation error in one term, the entirety of the option's physical and quantitative conclusions are sound. **Correct**.\n\n**B. The transition criterion is the classical thermal Rayleigh number $Ra_T=g\\,\\beta_T\\,\\Delta T\\,L^3/(\\nu\\,\\alpha)$ with critical $Ra_T\\sim 10^9$, and species effects should be neglected. For the given data, $Ra_T\\approx 3.5\\times 10^9$ (turbulent), making the gas-side heat transfer increase by nearly an order of magnitude, so the overall $U$ rises to about $30$–$40\\ \\mathrm{W/(m^2\\cdot K)}$.**\n- My analysis shows the solutal buoyancy term is significant (about $43\\%$ of the thermal term) and cannot be neglected.\n- The increase in the heat transfer coefficient from laminar to turbulent flow is a factor of $h_{g,\\mathrm{turb}}/h_{g,\\mathrm{lam}} \\approx 5.26/3.70 \\approx 1.4$, not \"nearly an order of magnitude\" (a factor of $10$).\n- The resultant overall heat transfer coefficient is around $5\\ \\mathrm{W/(m^2\\cdot K)}$, not $30$–$40\\ \\mathrm{W/(m^2\\cdot K)}$. This option contains multiple significant errors. **Incorrect**.\n\n**C. Because water vapor is lighter than air, thermal and solutal buoyancies oppose, so the effective driving is $|\\beta_T\\,\\Delta T-\\beta_y\\,\\Delta y_v|$. For the given data the opposition nearly cancels, the flow remains laminar, and $U$ is essentially unchanged.**\n- This is fundamentally incorrect. The plate is colder than the bulk ($T_i < T_{\\infty}$), so the fluid near the plate is cooler and denser. This drives downward motion. The concentration of light water vapor is also lower near the cold condensing plate ($y_{v,i} < y_{v,\\infty}$), meaning the mixture near the plate has a higher concentration of heavy air, making it denser. This also drives downward motion. The thermal and solutal buoyancy effects are **aiding**, not opposing. **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. Transition in this setting is governed by a critical Reynolds number $Re_{\\mathrm{crit}}\\approx 5\\times 10^5$ based on a free-fall velocity, which is not exceeded here; moreover, turbulence thickens the gas film and therefore reduces $U$ relative to laminar flow.**\n- The transition criterion for natural convection is the Rayleigh number ($Ra$), not the Reynolds number ($Re$), which is used for forced convection.\n- The claim that turbulence reduces the overall heat transfer coefficient $U$ is fundamentally false. Turbulence enhances transport mechanisms, increasing heat and mass transfer coefficients. **Incorrect**.\n\nBased on the detailed analysis, Option A is the only one that presents a physically coherent and quantitatively reasonable picture, despite a minor error in its symbolic formulation. It is the \"most consistent\" conclusion.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2470193"}]}
