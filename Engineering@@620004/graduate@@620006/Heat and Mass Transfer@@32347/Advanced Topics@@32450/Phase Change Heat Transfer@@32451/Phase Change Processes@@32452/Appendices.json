A rigorous solution will be provided.\n\nThe problem requires the derivation of the kinetic-limited net interfacial mass flux, $m''_{\\mathrm{kin}}$. This derivation begins with the kinetic theory of gases. The one-sided mass flux $J$ (mass per unit area per unit time) of molecules of an ideal gas impinging on a surface is a standard result. For a Maxwellian velocity distribution, this flux is given by:\n$$J = p \\sqrt{\\frac{M}{2 \\pi R_u T}}$$\nwhere $p$ is the pressure, $M$ is the molar mass of the gas, $R_u$ is the universal gas constant, and $T$ is the absolute temperature.\n\nThe net mass flux across the interface, $m''_{\\mathrm{kin}}$, is the difference between the evaporative flux from the liquid and the condensative flux from the vapor.\nThe evaporative flux, $m''_{\\mathrm{evap}}$, originates from the liquid phase. It is modeled as the flux that would be emitted into a vacuum from a surface at temperature $T_i$. The effective pressure driving this flux is the saturation pressure, $p_{\\mathrm{sat}}(T_i)$. The accommodation coefficient, $\\alpha$, represents the fraction of molecules that undergo phase change upon interaction. Therefore, the evaporation flux is:\n$$m''_{\\mathrm{evap}} = \\alpha \\sqrt{\\frac{M_w}{2 \\pi R_u T_i}} p_{\\mathrm{sat}}(T_i)$$\nThe condensative flux, $m''_{\\mathrm{cond}}$, is due to vapor molecules from the gas phase impinging on and being absorbed by the liquid surface. This flux depends on the partial pressure of the vapor at the interface, $p_{v,i}$. In the kinetic limit where transport to the interface is infinitely fast, $p_{v,i}$ is the pressure in the bulk gas, $p_v$. The condensation flux is thus:\n$$m''_{\\mathrm{cond}} = \\alpha \\sqrt{\\frac{M_w}{2 \\pi R_u T_i}} p_v$$\nThe assumption of a single accommodation coefficient $\\alpha$ for both evaporation and condensation is a consequence of detailed balance at equilibrium.\n\nThe net mass flux, which is the quantity sought, is the difference between these two opposing fluxes:\n$$m''_{\\mathrm{kin}} = m''_{\\mathrm{evap}} - m''_{\\mathrm{cond}}$$\n$$m''_{\\mathrm{kin}} = \\alpha \\sqrt{\\frac{M_w}{2 \\pi R_u T_i}} \\left( p_{\\mathrm{sat}}(T_i) - p_v \\right)$$\nThis is the Hertz-Knudsen-Schrage equation for the kinetic-limited mass flux.

The one-dimensional mass flux of the vapor is described by Fick's law corrected for bulk motion:\n$$\nn''_{v} = Y_{v} n'' + J''_{v} = Y_{v} n''_{v} - \\rho_g D_{va} \\frac{dY_v}{dz}\n$$\nwhere $Y_v$ is the vapor mass fraction, $\\rho_g$ is the gas mixture density, $D_{va}$ is the binary mass diffusivity, and $z$ is the coordinate normal to the interface, starting at $z=0$ at the interface and extending into the gas. Rearranging this equation gives:\n$$\nn''_{v} (1-Y_{v}) = -\\rho_g D_{va} \\frac{dY_v}{dz}\n$$\nFor a steady-state process, $n''_{v}$ is constant. We can separate variables and integrate across the idealized gas diffusion layer of thickness $\\delta_g$, from the interface ($z=0$, $Y_v=Y_{v,i}$) to the edge of the diffusion layer ($z=\\delta_g$, $Y_v=Y_{v,\\infty}$):\n$$\nn''_{v} \\int_0^{\\delta_g} dz = -\\rho_g D_{va} \\int_{Y_{v,i}}^{Y_{v,\\infty}} \\frac{dY_v}{1-Y_v}\n$$\nPerforming the integration yields:\n$$\nn''_{v} \\delta_g = -\\rho_g D_{va} [-\\ln(1-Y_v)]_{Y_{v,i}}^{Y_{v,\\infty}} = \\rho_g D_{va} [\\ln(1-Y_{v,\\infty}) - \\ln(1-Y_{v,i})]\n$$\nThe condensation mass flux is therefore:\n$$\nn''_{v} = \\frac{\\rho_g D_{va}}{\\delta_g} \\ln\\left(\\frac{1-Y_{v,\\infty}}{1-Y_{v,i}}\\right)\n$$\nThe problem states that gas-side sensible heat effects are negligible. Thus, the heat flux supplied to the interface is purely from the latent heat of condensation, $h_{fg}$. The latent heat flux, $q''_{latent}$, is:\n$$\nq''_{latent} = n''_{v} h_{fg} = \\frac{\\rho_g D_{va} h_{fg}}{\\delta_g} \\ln\\left(\\frac{1-Y_{v,\\infty}}{1-Y_{v,i}}\\right)\n$$\n\nThe critical condition is defined by the energy balance at the interface where the latent heat released equals the heat conducted away:\n$$\nq''_{latent} = q''_{\\ell}\n$$\nSubstituting the expressions we derived:\n$$\n\\frac{\\rho_g D_{va} h_{fg}}{\\delta_g} \\ln\\left(\\frac{1-Y_{v,\\infty}}{1-Y_{v,i}}\\right) = \\frac{k_{\\ell} \\Delta T_{\\ell}}{\\delta_{\\ell}}\n$$\nWe must now introduce the Spalding mass transfer number, $B_m$, defined as:\n$$\nB_m = \\frac{Y_{v,i} - Y_{v,\\infty}}{1 - Y_{v,i}}\n$$\nWe need to express the argument of the logarithm in terms of $B_m$. From the definition of $B_m$, we can write $1 - Y_{v,\\infty}$ by finding it from $1-Y_{v,i}$.\n$B_m(1-Y_{v,i}) = Y_{v,i} - Y_{v,\\infty} = (1-Y_{v,\\infty})-(1-Y_{v,i})$.\n$B_m(1-Y_{v,i}) + (1-Y_{v,i}) = 1-Y_{v,\\infty}$.\n$(1+B_m)(1-Y_{v,i}) = 1-Y_{v,\\infty}$.\nTherefore, the ratio inside the logarithm is:\n$$\n\\frac{1-Y_{v,\\infty}}{1-Y_{v,i}} = 1+B_m\n$$\nThe energy balance equation becomes a condition for the critical Spalding number, $B_{m,\\star}$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\rho_g D_{va} h_{fg}}{\\delta_g} \\ln(1 + B_{m,\\star}) = \\frac{k_{\\ell} \\Delta T_{\\ell}}{\\delta_{\\ell}}\n$$\nNow, we solve for $B_{m,\\star}$. First, isolate the logarithm:\n$$\n\\ln(1 + B_{m,\\star}) = \\frac{k_{\\ell} \\Delta T_{\\ell}}{\\delta_{\\ell}} \\frac{\\delta_g}{\\rho_g D_{va} h_{fg}} = \\frac{k_{\\ell} \\delta_g \\Delta T_{\\ell}}{\\rho_g D_{va} h_{fg} \\delta_{\\ell}}\n$$\nTo solve for $B_{m,\\star}$, we exponentiate both sides:\n$$\n1 + B_{m,\\star} = \\exp\\left(\\frac{k_{\\ell} \\delta_g \\Delta T_{\\ell}}{\\rho_g D_{va} h_{fg} \\delta_{\\ell}}\\right)\n$$\nFinally, subtracting $1$ yields the expression for the critical Spalding mass transfer number:\n$$\nB_{m,\\star} = \\exp\\left(\\frac{k_{\\ell} \\delta_g \\Delta T_{\\ell}}{\\rho_g D_{va} h_{fg} \\delta_{\\ell}}\\right) - 1\n$$\nThis expression relates the mass transfer potential ($B_{m,\\star}$) to the ratio of characteristic thermal and mass transport resistances, scaled by the ratio of thermal to latent energy.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\exp\\left(\\frac{k_{\\ell} \\delta_g \\Delta T_{\\ell}}{\\rho_g D_{va} h_{fg} \\delta_{\\ell}}\\right) - 1}$$", "id": "2514560"}]}
