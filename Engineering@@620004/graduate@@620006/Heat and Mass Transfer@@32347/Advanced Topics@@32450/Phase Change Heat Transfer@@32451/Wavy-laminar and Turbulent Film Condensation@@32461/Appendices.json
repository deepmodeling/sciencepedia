All assumptions—steady, laminar flow, negligible inertia, constant properties, zero vapor shear, and a shear-free interface—are standard for this canonical problem in heat and mass transfer. The problem is well-posed, scientifically grounded, and contains all necessary information and boundary conditions to derive a unique solution for the velocity profile. Therefore, the problem is valid, and we may proceed with the derivation.\n\nThe analysis begins with the conservation of linear momentum for a viscous fluid. The system is governed by the Navier-Stokes equations. We consider the momentum equation in the $x$-direction, which is aligned with gravity. For a steady, incompressible, Newtonian fluid, the $x$-momentum equation is:\n$$\n\\rho_{l} \\left( u \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x} + v \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial y} \\right) = -\\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial x} + \\mu_{l} \\left( \\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial x^2} + \\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial y^2} \\right) + \\rho_{l} g_{x}\n$$\nHere, $u$ and $v$ are the velocity components in the $x$ and $y$ directions, respectively, $p$ is the pressure, $\\rho_{l}$ is the liquid density, $\\mu_{l}$ is the liquid dynamic viscosity, and $g_{x}$ is the component of gravitational acceleration in the $x$-direction.\n\nWe apply the assumptions given in the problem statement to simplify this equation:\n1.  **Steady and Parallel Flow**: The flow is steady ($\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t} = 0$) and assumed to be parallel to the plate, meaning the velocity component normal to the plate is negligible ($v \\approx 0$). From the continuity equation for an incompressible fluid, $\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x} + \\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial y} = 0$, this implies that $\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x} = 0$. This is a key assumption of Nusselt theory, indicating that the velocity profile $u(y)$ is fully developed and does not change with the downstream coordinate $x$. Consequently, the term $\\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial x^2}$ is also zero.\n2.  **Negligible Inertia**: The advection terms on the left-hand side, $\\rho_{l} ( u \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x} + v \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial y} )$, are assumed to be negligible compared to the viscous and body forces. This is justified by the simplifications from the parallel flow assumption, as both terms become zero.\n3.  **Pressure Gradient**: The vapor is stationary, so the pressure in the vapor phase is hydrostatic. Across the thin liquid film, the pressure variation in the $y$-direction is negligible. Thus, the pressure in the liquid film is approximately uniform and equal to the pressure at the interface, $p_{sat}(T_{\\infty})$. Since this saturation pressure is constant, the pressure gradient in the flow direction, $\\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial x}$, is zero.\n4.  **Gravitational Force**: The $x$-coordinate is directed vertically downward, aligned with the gravitational force. Therefore, $g_{x} = g$.\n\nApplying these simplifications, the $x$-momentum equation reduces to a balance between the viscous shear forces and the gravitational body force. Since $u$ is now only a function of $y$, we use an ordinary differential:\n$$\n0 = 0 + \\mu_{l} \\frac{d^2 u}{dy^2} + \\rho_{l} g\n$$\nRearranging this gives the governing ordinary differential equation (ODE) for the velocity profile $u(y)$:\n$$\n\\frac{d^2 u}{dy^2} = -\\frac{\\rho_{l} g}{\\mu_{l}}\n$$\nThis is a second-order ODE for $u(y)$ which requires two boundary conditions for its solution. The boundary conditions are derived from the physical constraints at the wall and the liquid-vapor interface.\n\n1.  **No-slip condition at the wall**: The liquid adheres to the solid surface of the plate. At $y=0$, the velocity of the fluid must be zero.\n    $$u(0) = 0$$\n2.  **Zero-shear condition at the interface**: The problem states that the vapor is stationary and its shear effect on the liquid film is negligible. This implies that the shear stress at the liquid-vapor interface ($y=\\delta$) is zero. For a Newtonian fluid, the shear stress is given by $\\tau_{yx} = \\mu_{l} \\frac{du}{dy}$.\n    $$ \\left. \\frac{du}{dy} \\right|_{y=\\delta} = 0 $$\nWe solve the ODE by integrating twice. Integrating with respect to $y$ once yields:\n$$\n\\frac{du}{dy} = -\\frac{\\rho_{l} g}{\\mu_{l}} y + C_{1}\n$$\nwhere $C_{1}$ is the first integration constant. We apply the zero-shear boundary condition at $y=\\delta$:\n$$\n0 = -\\frac{\\rho_{l} g}{\\mu_{l}} \\delta + C_{1} \\implies C_{1} = \\frac{\\rho_{l} g \\delta}{\\mu_{l}}\n$$\nSubstituting $C_{1}$ back gives the expression for the velocity gradient:\n$$\n\\frac{du}{dy} = \\frac{\\rho_{l} g}{\\mu_{l}} (\\delta - y)\n$$\nIntegrating a second time with respect to $y$ gives the velocity profile:\n$$\nu(y) = \\int \\frac{\\rho_{l} g}{\\mu_{l}} (\\delta - y) dy = \\frac{\\rho_{l} g}{\\mu_{l}} \\left( \\delta y - \\frac{y^2}{2} \\right) + C_{2}\n$$\nwhere $C_{2}$ is the second integration constant. We apply the no-slip boundary condition at $y=0$:\n$$\nu(0) = 0 = \\frac{\\rho_{l} g}{\\mu_{l}} \\left( \\delta(0) - \\frac{0^2}{2} \\right) + C_{2} \\implies C_{2} = 0\n$$\nThus, the analytical expression for the velocity profile $u(y)$ is:\n$$\nu(y) = \\frac{\\rho_{l} g}{\\mu_{l}} \\left( \\delta y - \\frac{y^2}{2} \\right)\n$$\nThis velocity profile is parabolic, starting from zero at the wall and increasing with distance from the wall.\n\nTo find the location $y_{\\max}$ where the velocity is maximum, we must find the point where the first derivative of velocity with respect to $y$ is zero, and the second derivative is negative. We already have the expression for the first derivative:\n$$\n\\frac{du}{dy} = \\frac{\\rho_{l} g}{\\mu_{l}} (\\delta - y)\n$$\nSetting this to zero:\n$$\n\\frac{\\rho_{l} g}{\\mu_{l}} (\\delta - y_{\\max}) = 0\n$$\nSince $\\rho_{l}$, $g$, and $\\mu_{l}$ are non-zero positive constants, the term in parentheses must be zero:\n$$\n\\delta - y_{\\max} = 0 \\implies y_{\\max} = \\delta\n$$\nThis result is consistent with the zero-shear boundary condition at the interface. The second derivative is $\\frac{d^2 u}{dy^2} = -\\frac{\\rho_{l} g}{\\mu_{l}}$, which is negative, confirming that the velocity is maximum at this location. The maximum velocity is therefore attained at the liquid-vapor interface, $y=\\delta$.\n\nThe final results are the expression for $u(y)$ and the value of $y_{\\max}$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{\\rho_{l} g}{\\mu_{l}} \\left( \\delta y - \\frac{y^{2}}{2} \\right) & \\delta \\end{pmatrix}}$$", "id": "2537788"}, {"introduction": "The classic laminar model provides a powerful starting point, but its applicability is limited.

The film has a local thickness $\\delta(x)$.\n\nFirst, we consider the momentum balance. For a steady, gravity-driven laminar film with negligible inertia and vapor shear, the momentum equation in the $x$-direction simplifies to a balance between gravitational and viscous forces:\n$$ \\mu_{l} \\frac{d^{2}u}{dy^{2}} = -(\\rho_{l} - \\rho_{v})g $$\nwhere $u$ is the fluid velocity in the $x$-direction, $\\mu_{l}$ is the liquid dynamic viscosity, $\\rho_{l}$ is the liquid density, $\\rho_{v}$ is the vapor density, and $g$ is the gravitational acceleration. Given that the vapor is saturated at atmospheric pressure, its density is much less than the liquid density ($\\rho_{v} \\ll \\rho_{l}$).

Negligible shear at the liquid-vapor interface: $\\tau(y=\\delta) = \\mu_{l} \\frac{du}{dy}|_{y=\\delta} = 0$.\n\nIntegrating the momentum equation once with respect to $y$ yields:\n$$ \\mu_{l} \\frac{du}{dy} = -\\rho_{l}g y + C_{1} $$\nApplying the zero-shear boundary condition at $y=\\delta(x)$, we find the constant of integration $C_{1}$:\n$$ 0 = -\\rho_{l}g \\delta(x) + C_{1} \\implies C_{1} = \\rho_{l}g \\delta(x) $$\nSubstituting $C_{1}$ back gives the velocity gradient:\n$$ \\mu_{l} \\frac{du}{dy} = \\rho_{l}g (\\delta(x) - y) $$\nIntegrating a second time yields the velocity profile:\n$$ \\mu_{l} u(y) = \\rho_{l}g \\left( \\delta(x) y - \\frac{y^2}{2} \\right) + C_{2} $$\nApplying the no-slip condition at $y=0$, we find $C_{2}=0$.

Next, we determine $\\delta(x)$ from an energy balance. The problem states that heat transfer across the film equals the local latent heat release. The rate of heat transfer $d\\dot{q}$ through a differential area $dA = (dx)(1)$ is equal to the latent heat $h_{fg}$ released by the incremental mass flow rate $d\\Gamma$ condensing over that area:\n$$ d\\dot{q} = h_{fg} d\\Gamma $$\nAssuming a linear temperature profile across the film, the heat flux by conduction is constant through the film and is given by Fourier's law:\n$$ q'' = k_{l} \\frac{T_{\\mathrm{sat}} - T_{w}}{\\delta(x)} $$\nThe heat transfer rate is then $d\\dot{q} = q'' dA = k_{l} \\frac{T_{\\mathrm{sat}} - T_{w}}{\\delta(x)} dx$.

This approach defines a model for partitioning the energy transfer.\n\nLet us consider a unit mass of vapor condensing.\nThe latent heat released during the phase change from saturated vapor to saturated liquid at temperature $T_{\\text{sat}}$ is, by definition, the latent heat of vaporization, $h_{fg}$.\nThe sensible heat that must be removed to cool this unit mass of liquid from the saturation temperature $T_{\\text{sat}}$ to the wall temperature $T_{w}$ is given by $c_{p,l} (T_{\\text{sat}} - T_{w})$, where $c_{p,l}$ is the specific heat of the liquid.\n\nWe can express the local heat flux components as being proportional to the local mass condensation rate, $\\dot{m}''$ (mass per unit time per unit area).\nThe rate of latent heat release per unit area is:\n$$q''_{lat} = \\dot{m}'' h_{fg}$$\nFollowing the interpretation of the problem statement, the rate of sensible heat removal per unit area is modeled as the heat removed to cool the newly condensed mass from $T_{\\text{sat}}$ to $T_{w}$:\n$$q''_{sens} = \\dot{m}'' c_{p,l} (T_{\\text{sat}} - T_{w})$$\nThis is a conceptual partition of the total energy transfer.\n\nSubstituting these expressions into the formula for the fraction $F_{sens}$:\n$$F_{sens} = \\frac{\\dot{m}'' c_{p,l} (T_{\\text{sat}} - T_{w})}{\\dot{m}'' h_{fg} + \\dot{m}'' c_{p,l} (T_{\\text{sat}} - T_{w})}$$\nThe local mass condensation rate, $\\dot{m}''$, is a common factor in both the numerator and the denominator, and thus it cancels out:\n$$F_{sens} = \\frac{c_{p,l} (T_{\\text{sat}} - T_{w})}{h_{fg} + c_{p,l} (T_{\\text{sat}} - T_{w})}$$\nThis expression can be written more compactly using the Jakob number, $Ja$, which is a dimensionless group representing the ratio of sensible to latent heat.\n$$Ja = \\frac{c_{p,l} (T_{\\text{sat}} - T_{w})}{h_{fg}}$$\nSubstituting $Ja$ into the expression for $F_{sens}$:\n$$F_{sens} = \\frac{Ja \\cdot h_{fg}}{h_{fg} + Ja \\cdot h_{fg}} = \\frac{Ja}{1 + Ja}$$\n\nThe reason this result is independent of the hydrodynamic regime (and thus the film Reynolds number, $Re_{f} = 3000$) is fundamental to this derivation. We have formulated the fraction based on a ratio of thermodynamic energy components associated with a unit mass of fluid, not on a detailed analysis of the heat transfer *rate*. The rate itself, $q''_{w}$, is indeed strongly dependent on the flow regime (laminar, wavy, turbulent) because the hydrodynamics govern the film thickness, velocity profile, and temperature profile, which in turn determine the thermal resistance of the film. However, by modeling the *composition* of the heat flux based on the composition of the total enthalpy change, the kinetic aspect of the process, represented by $\\dot{m}''$, is eliminated from the ratio. The result is a thermodynamic fraction, not a kinetic one.\n\nWe now evaluate this fraction numerically using the provided data for water:\n$T_{sat} = 373.15\\ \\text{K}$\n$T_{w} = 353.15\\ \\text{K}$\n$h_{fg} = 2.257 \\times 10^{6}\\ \\text{J}\\,\\text{kg}^{-1}$\n$c_{p,l} = 4.217 \\times 10^{3}\\ \\text{J}\\,\\text{kg}^{-1}\\,\\text{K}^{-1}$\n\nFirst, calculate the sensible heat term per unit mass:\n$$c_{p,l} (T_{\\text{sat}} - T_{w}) = (4.217 \\times 10^{3}\\ \\text{J}\\,\\text{kg}^{-1}\\,\\text{K}^{-1}) \\times (373.15\\ \\text{K} - 353.15\\ \\text{K})$$\n$$c_{p,l} (T_{\\text{sat}} - T_{w}) = (4.217 \\times 10^{3}) \\times (20)\\ \\text{J}\\,\\text{kg}^{-1} = 84340\\ \\text{J}\\,\\text{kg}^{-1}$$\n\nNow, substitute this value and $h_{fg}$ into the expression for $F_{sens}$:\n$$F_{sens} = \\frac{84340\\ \\text{J}\\,\\text{kg}^{-1}}{2.257 \\times 10^{6}\\ \\text{J}\\,\\text{kg}^{-1} + 84340\\ \\text{J}\\,\\text{kg}^{-1}}$$\n$$F_{sens} = \\frac{84340}{2257000 + 84340} = \\frac{84340}{2341340}$$\n$$F_{sens} \\approx 0.03602236$$\n\nRounding the result to four significant figures as required by the problem statement gives $0.03602$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.03602}$$", "id": "2537835"}]}
