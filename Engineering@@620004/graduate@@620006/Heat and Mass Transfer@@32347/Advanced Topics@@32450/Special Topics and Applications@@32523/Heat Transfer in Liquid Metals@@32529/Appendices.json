The problem is objective.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. It is a well-defined, scientifically sound problem in convective heat transfer. A solution will be derived.\n\nThe analysis begins with the steady, $2$-D conservation of energy equation for a laminar boundary layer with constant properties, neglecting viscous dissipation and pressure work:\n$$\nu \\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial x} + v \\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial y} = \\alpha \\frac{\\partial^2 T}{\\partial y^2}\n$$\nHere, $u$ and $v$ are the velocity components in the streamwise ($x$) and wall-normal ($y$) directions, respectively, $T$ is the temperature, and $\\alpha$ is the thermal diffusivity.\n\nThe crucial information is that the Prandtl number, $\\mathrm{Pr} = \\nu/\\alpha$, is very small, $\\mathrm{Pr} \\ll 1$. This signifies that the thermal diffusivity $\\alpha$ is much larger than the momentum diffusivity (kinematic viscosity) $\\nu$. Consequently, heat diffuses much more effectively into the fluid than momentum. This results in the thermal boundary layer, of thickness $\\delta_T$, being much thicker than the hydrodynamic (momentum) boundary layer, of thickness $\\delta$. That is, $\\delta_T \\gg \\delta$.\n\nThe velocity profile within the hydrodynamic boundary layer changes from $u=0$ at the wall ($y=0$) to $u \\approx U_{\\infty}$ for $y \\ge \\delta$. Since $\\delta_T$ is much larger than $\\delta$, for the vast majority of the region where the temperature varies (i.e., the thermal boundary layer), the streamwise velocity $u$ is essentially equal to the free-stream velocity $U_{\\infty}$. Therefore, as a leading-order approximation for the temperature field, we can simplify the convective term in the energy equation by setting $u(x,y) \\approx U_{\\infty}$. Under this slug-flow approximation for the thermal layer, the continuity equation $\\partial u/\\partial x + \\partial v/\\partial y = 0$ implies $\\partial v/\\partial y \\approx 0$, and since $v=0$ at the wall, we take $v \\approx 0$ throughout this region.\n\nWith this simplification, the energy equation reduces to a linearized form:\n$$\nU_{\\infty} \\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial x} = \\alpha \\frac{\\partial^2 T}{\\partial y^2}\n$$\nThis equation is a parabolic partial differential equation, analogous to the one-dimensional transient heat conduction equation, where the temporal variable is replaced by the spatial coordinate group $x/U_{\\infty}$.\n\nThe boundary conditions are:\n1.  Isothermal wall: $T(x, 0) = T_w$ for $x > 0$.\n2.  Free-stream temperature: $T(x, y \\to \\infty) = T_{\\infty}$.\n3.  Upstream condition: $T(0, y > 0) = T_{\\infty}$, as the fluid entering at $x=0$ is at the free-stream temperature.\n\nTo solve this system, we introduce a non-dimensional temperature $\\theta$:\n$$\n\\theta(x, y) = \\frac{T(x, y) - T_w}{T_{\\infty} - T_w}\n$$\nThe governing equation and boundary conditions in terms of $\\theta$ become:\n$$\nU_{\\infty} \\frac{\\partial \\theta}{\\partial x} = \\alpha \\frac{\\partial^2 \\theta}{\\partial y^2}\n$$\nwith boundary conditions: $\\theta(x, 0) = 0$, $\\theta(x, \\infty) = 1$, and $\\theta(0, y > 0) = 1$.\n\nThis is a classic similarity problem. We introduce a similarity variable $\\eta$:\n$$\n\\eta = y \\sqrt{\\frac{U_{\\infty}}{\\alpha x}}\n$$\nWe assume a similarity solution of the form $\\theta(x, y) = f(\\eta)$. The partial derivatives are transformed into ordinary derivatives with respect to $\\eta$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial \\theta}{\\partial x} = f'(\\eta) \\frac{\\partial \\eta}{\\partial x} = f'(\\eta) \\left( -\\frac{1}{2} \\frac{y}{x} \\sqrt{\\frac{U_{\\infty}}{\\alpha x}} \\right) = -f'(\\eta) \\frac{\\eta}{2x}\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial^2 \\theta}{\\partial y^2} = f''(\\eta) \\left( \\frac{\\partial \\eta}{\\partial y} \\right)^2 = f''(\\eta) \\left( \\sqrt{\\frac{U_{\\infty}}{\\alpha x}} \\right)^2 = f''(\\eta) \\frac{U_{\\infty}}{\\alpha x}\n$$\nSubstituting these into the PDE for $\\theta$:\n$$\nU_{\\infty} \\left( -f'(\\eta) \\frac{\\eta}{2x} \\right) = \\alpha \\left( f''(\\eta) \\frac{U_{\\infty}}{\\alpha x} \\right)\n$$\nThis simplifies to the ordinary differential equation:\n$$\nf''(\\eta) + \\frac{\\eta}{2} f'(\\eta) = 0\n$$\nThe boundary conditions for $f(\\eta)$ are:\n1.  At $y=0$, $\\eta=0$: $f(0) = \\theta(x, 0) = 0$.\n2.  As $y \\to \\infty$, $\\eta \\to \\infty$: $f(\\infty) = \\theta(x, \\infty) = 1$.\n\nTo solve the ODE, let $g(\\eta) = f'(\\eta)$. The equation becomes $g'(\\eta) + \\frac{\\eta}{2} g(\\eta) = 0$, which is a separable first-order ODE. Its solution is $g(\\eta) = C_1 \\exp(-\\eta^2/4)$.\nThus, $f'(\\eta) = C_1 \\exp(-\\eta^2/4)$. Integrating with respect to $\\eta$ gives:\n$$\nf(\\eta) = C_1 \\int_0^\\eta \\exp(-\\zeta^2/4) d\\zeta + C_2\n$$\nApplying the first boundary condition, $f(0)=0$, yields $C_2=0$. The solution is then related to the error function, $\\mathrm{erf}(z) = \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{\\pi}} \\int_0^z \\exp(-t^2) dt$. Using a substitution $t=\\zeta/2$, the integral becomes:\n$$\nf(\\eta) = C_1 \\int_0^{\\eta/2} \\exp(-t^2) (2 dt) = 2C_1 \\frac{\\sqrt{\\pi}}{2} \\mathrm{erf}(\\eta/2) = C_1 \\sqrt{\\pi} \\, \\mathrm{erf}(\\eta/2)\n$$\nApplying the second boundary condition, $f(\\infty)=1$:\n$$\n1 = C_1 \\sqrt{\\pi} \\, \\mathrm{erf}(\\infty) = C_1 \\sqrt{\\pi} \\cdot 1\n$$\nThis gives $C_1 = 1/\\sqrt{\\pi}$.

The request to use an integral method with a specified profile shape and boundary conditions is a standard and solvable task in boundary layer theory. The problem is self-contained and free of contradictions. Therefore, we proceed with the solution.\n\nThe analysis is to be performed at the stagnation line, where $x=0$. The steady, two-dimensional conservation of energy for an incompressible fluid with constant properties and negligible viscous dissipation is given by:\n$$ u \\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial x} + v \\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial y} = \\alpha \\left( \\frac{\\partial^2 T}{\\partial x^2} + \\frac{\\partial^2 T}{\\partial y^2} \\right) $$\nwhere $T$ is the temperature, $u$ and $v$ are the velocity components in the $x$ and $y$ directions respectively, and $\\alpha$ is the thermal diffusivity.\n\nAt the stagnation line $x=0$, the velocity component $u=ax$ is zero.

The mean energy equation in the wall-normal coordinate reduces, under the gradient-diffusion hypothesis, to the statement that the wall-normal heat flux is constant across the half-channel. The total (molecular plus turbulent) heat flux can be expressed in terms of a total diffusivity as follows. Let $y$ be the wall-normal coordinate from the wall to the centerline, let $\\rho$ be the density, let $c_p$ be the isobaric specific heat, and define the molecular thermal diffusivity as $\\alpha = \\nu/\\mathrm{Pr}$ where $\\nu$ is the kinematic viscosity and $\\mathrm{Pr}$ is the molecular Prandtl number.

Each $\\mathcal{E}$ must be printed as a floating-point number rounded to exactly four digits after the decimal point, with no units.", "solution": "The problem as stated is scientifically sound, well-posed, and contains all necessary information for a unique solution. It is a standard exercise in the analysis of turbulent heat transfer using semi-empirical closures. We will proceed with its solution.\n\nThe objective is to compute the ratio of wall heat fluxes, $\\mathcal{E} = q_w(\\mathrm{Pr}_t^{\\mathrm{var}}) / q_w(\\mathrm{Pr}_t^{\\mathrm{const}})$, predicted by two different models for the turbulent Prandtl number, $\\mathrm{Pr}_t$. This requires deriving an expression for the wall heat flux, $q_w$, which will be shown to be inversely proportional to a certain integral over the channel half-height.\n\nWe begin with the provided mean energy equation for a fully-developed turbulent channel flow, where the total heat flux is constant across the channel half-width:\n$$ \\frac{d\\bar{T}}{dy} = \\frac{q_w}{\\rho c_p (\\alpha + \\alpha_t)} $$\nHere, $\\bar{T}$ is the mean temperature, $y$ is the wall-normal coordinate, $q_w$ is the constant wall heat flux, $\\rho$ is the density, $c_p$ is the specific heat capacity, $\\alpha = \\nu/\\mathrm{Pr}$ is the molecular thermal diffusivity, and $\\alpha_t = \\nu_t/\\mathrm{Pr}_t$ is the turbulent thermal diffusivity.\n\nTo find the temperature difference between the channel centerline ($y=h$) and the wall ($y=0$), we integrate this equation from $y=0$ to $y=h$:\n$$ \\Delta T \\equiv \\bar{T}(y=h) - \\bar{T}(y=0) = \\int_0^h \\frac{d\\bar{T}}{dy} dy = \\int_0^h \\frac{q_w}{\\rho c_p (\\alpha + \\alpha_t)} dy $$\nSince $q_w$, $\\rho$, and $c_p$ are constants, we can rearrange this to express $q_w$ as a functional of the total diffusivity profile, $\\alpha(y) + \\alpha_t(y)$:\n$$ q_w = \\rho c_p \\Delta T \\left( \\int_0^h \\frac{1}{\\alpha + \\alpha_t} dy \\right)^{-1} $$\nAll physical quantities except for the integral are independent of the choice of the $\\mathrm{Pr}_t$ model. The friction velocity $u_\\tau$ and friction Reynolds number $Re_\\tau$ depend only on the bulk Reynolds number $Re_b$, which is fixed for each case. The temperature difference $\\Delta T$ is a prescribed boundary condition. Therefore, for a given flow condition and $\\Delta T$, the wall heat flux $q_w$ is inversely proportional to the integral:\n$$ q_w \\propto \\left( \\int_0^h \\frac{1}{\\alpha + \\alpha_t} dy \\right)^{-1} $$\nTo evaluate this integral, we nondimensionalize it using wall units. The dimensionless wall coordinate is $y^+ = y u_\\tau / \\nu$, where $u_\\tau = \\sqrt{\\tau_w/\\rho}$ is the friction velocity. This gives $y = y^+ \\nu / u_\\tau$ and $dy = (\\nu/u_\\tau) dy^+$. The integration limit $y=h$ becomes $y^+ = h u_\\tau / \\nu = Re_\\tau$.\n\nThe diffusivities can be written in terms of dimensionless quantities:\n- Molecular: $\\alpha = \\nu / \\mathrm{Pr}$.\n- Turbulent: $\\alpha_t = \\nu_t / \\mathrm{Pr}_t = (\\nu_t/\\nu) \\nu / \\mathrm{Pr}_t = \\nu_t^+ \\nu / \\mathrm{Pr}_t$.\nThe total diffusivity is $\\alpha + \\alpha_t = \\nu (1/\\mathrm{Pr} + \\nu_t^+/\\mathrm{Pr}_t)$.\n\nSubstituting these into the integral:\n$$ \\int_0^h \\frac{1}{\\alpha + \\alpha_t} dy = \\int_0^{Re_\\tau} \\frac{1}{\\nu \\left(\\frac{1}{\\mathrm{Pr}} + \\frac{\\nu_t^+}{\\mathrm{Pr}_t}\\right)} \\left(\\frac{\\nu}{u_\\tau}\\right) dy^+ = \\frac{1}{u_\\tau} \\int_0^{Re_\\tau} \\frac{1}{\\frac{1}{\\mathrm{Pr}} + \\frac{\\nu_t^+(y^+)}{\\mathrm{Pr}_t}} dy^+ $$\nLet us define the dimensionless integral $I(\\mathrm{Pr}_t)$ as:\n$$ I(\\mathrm{Pr}_t) = \\int_0^{Re_\\tau} \\left(\\frac{1}{\\mathrm{Pr}} + \\frac{\\nu_t^+(y^+)}{\\mathrm{Pr}_t}\\right)^{-1} dy^+ $$\nThe wall heat flux is then $q_w = \\rho c_p \\Delta T u_\\tau / I(\\mathrm{Pr}_t)$. The ratio of heat fluxes under the two $\\mathrm{Pr}_t$ models is:\n$$ \\mathcal{E} = \\frac{q_w(\\mathrm{Pr}_t^{\\mathrm{var}})}{q_w(\\mathrm{Pr}_t^{\\mathrm{const}})} = \\frac{\\rho c_p \\Delta T u_\\tau / I(\\mathrm{Pr}_t^{\\mathrm{var}})}{\\rho c_p \\Delta T u_\\tau / I(\\mathrm{Pr}_t^{\\mathrm{const}})} = \\frac{I(\\mathrm{Pr}_t^{\\mathrm{const}})}{I(\\mathrm{Pr}_t^{\\mathrm{var}})} $$\nThis simplifies the problem to computing the ratio of two definite integrals.\n\nThe computational procedure for each test case ($Re_b$, $\\mathrm{Pr}$) is as follows:\n1.  Calculate the skin friction coefficient $C_f$ using the Dean correlation:\n    $$ C_f = 0.073 \\cdot Re_b^{-0.25} $$\n2.  Calculate the friction Reynolds number $Re_\\tau$:\n    $$ Re_\\tau = \\frac{Re_b}{2}\\sqrt{\\frac{C_f}{2}} $$\n    This value defines the upper limit of integration in wall units, $y^+_{max} = Re_\\tau$.\n3.  Define the eddy viscosity profile in wall units, $\\nu_t^+(y^+)$, using the provided model with constants $\\kappa = 0.41$ and $A^+ = 26$:\n    $$ \\nu_t^+(y^+) = \\kappa\\, y^+ \\left[1 - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{y^+}{A^+}\\right)\\right]^2 $$\n4.  Specify the two turbulent Prandtl numbers:\n    -   Constant model: $\\mathrm{Pr}_t^{\\mathrm{const}} = 0.9$.\n    -   Variable model: First compute the turbulent Péclet number $\\mathrm{Pe}_t = Re_\\tau \\cdot \\mathrm{Pr}$. Then,\n        $$ \\mathrm{Pr}_t^{\\mathrm{var}} = \\frac{0.85}{1 + 0.6 / \\sqrt{\\mathrm{Pe}_t}} $$\n        Note that for a given case, $\\mathrm{Pr}_t^{\\mathrm{var}}$ is a single value, constant with respect to $y^+$.\n5.  Numerically evaluate the two integrals using a suitable quadrature method, such as the composite trapezoidal rule, over a fine grid from $y^+=0$ to $y^+=Re_\\tau$:\n    $$ I_{\\mathrm{const}} = \\int_0^{Re_\\tau} \\left(\\frac{1}{\\mathrm{Pr}} + \\frac{\\nu_t^+(y^+)}{\\mathrm{Pr}_t^{\\mathrm{const}}}\\right)^{-1} dy^+ $$\n    $$ I_{\\mathrm{var}} = \\int_0^{Re_\\tau} \\left(\\frac{1}{\\mathrm{Pr}} + \\frac{\\nu_t^+(y^+)}{\\mathrm{Pr}_t^{\\mathrm{var}}}\\right)^{-1} dy^+ $$\n6.  Compute the final enhancement ratio $\\mathcal{E}$:\n    $$ \\mathcal{E} = \\frac{I_{\\mathrm{const}}}{I_{\\mathrm{var}}} $$\nThe following program implements this procedure for the specified test cases.
