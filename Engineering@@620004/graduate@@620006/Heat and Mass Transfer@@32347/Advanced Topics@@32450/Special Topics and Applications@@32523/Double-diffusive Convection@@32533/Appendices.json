The layer is heated from below and cooled from above with fixed temperatures at the plates, and it contains a dissolved solute whose concentration is higher at the bottom plate and lower at the top plate, both fixed. The fluid density obeys the Boussinesq approximation, $\\rho=\\rho_{0}\\bigl[1-\\beta_{T}(T-T_{0})+\\beta_{S}(C-C_{0})\\bigr]$, where $\\beta_{T}>0$ and $\\beta_{S}>0$.

It is scientifically grounded in the classical Darcy–Boussinesq framework and provides a complete, consistent set of equations and boundary conditions for a linear stability analysis. We may therefore proceed with the solution.\n\nThe problem asks for the marginal stability condition for stationary convection in a porous layer subjected to opposing thermal and solutal gradients. We are given the linearized and non-dimensionalized governing equations for small perturbations $\\{w, T, C\\}$ about the conduction-diffusion base state.\n\nThe governing equations for the perturbation amplitudes $\\{\\hat{w}(z), \\hat{T}(z), \\hat{C}(z)\\}$ are obtained by substituting the normal mode form $\\{w,T,C\\}(x,z,t)=\\Re\\{\\hat{w}(z),\\hat{T}(z),\\hat{C}(z)\\}\\exp(\\sigma t+\\mathrm{i}k x)$ into the provided partial differential equations.

The Laplacian becomes $\\nabla^2 \\to D^2 - k^2$. The base state gradients are $\\partial \\bar{T}/\\partial z = -1$ and $\\partial \\bar{C}/\\partial z = -1$.\n\nThe Darcy momentum equation, after eliminating the pressure $p$ and horizontal velocity $u$ using the continuity equation, becomes:\n$$ (D^2 - k^2)\\hat{w} = -k^2(\\mathrm{Ra}_T \\hat{T} - \\mathrm{Ra}_S \\hat{C}) $$\nThe energy and solute transport equations become:\n$$ \\sigma \\hat{T} - \\hat{w} = (D^2-k^2)\\hat{T} $$\n$$ \\sigma \\hat{C} - \\hat{w} = \\frac{1}{\\mathrm{Le}}(D^2-k^2)\\hat{C} $$\nWe consider the marginal stability condition for stationary onset, which corresponds to setting the growth rate $\\sigma=0$.

For such an eigenfunction, the operator $D^2$ acts as multiplication by $-(n\\pi)^2$. Substituting this into the differential equation yields an algebraic eigenvalue problem:\n$$ ((-(n\\pi)^2 - k^2)^2) = k^2(\\mathrm{Ra}_T - \\mathrm{Le}\\,\\mathrm{Ra}_S) $$\n$$ ((n\\pi)^2 + k^2)^2 = k^2(\\mathrm{Ra}_T - \\mathrm{Le}\\,\\mathrm{Ra}_S) $$\nSolving for the thermal Rayleigh number $\\mathrm{Ra}_T$ gives the marginal stability condition for a given vertical mode $n$ and horizontal wavenumber $k$:\n$$ \\mathrm{Ra}_T(k, n) = \\mathrm{Le}\\,\\mathrm{Ra}_S + \\frac{((n\\pi)^2 + k^2)^2}{k^2} $$\nThe problem asks for the \"primary vertical mode\", which is the most dangerous mode, corresponding to the minimum value of $\\mathrm{Ra}_T$ with respect to $n$. Since $\\mathrm{Ra}_T$ is an increasing function of $n^2$, the minimum occurs for the smallest possible integer value, which is $n=1$. The marginal stability curve for the primary mode is therefore:\n$$ \\mathrm{Ra}_T(k) = \\mathrm{Le}\\,\\mathrm{Ra}_S + \\frac{(\\pi^2 + k^2)^2}{k^2} $$\nTo perform a long-wavelength expansion for small $k \\to 0$, we expand the expression for $\\mathrm{Ra}_T(k)$.

This corresponds to retaining the two leading terms in the Laurent series as $k \\to 0$, which are the terms of order $k^{-2}$ and $k^0$. These are dominant in the long-wavelength limit.\nThus, the approximation is:\n$$ \\mathrm{Ra}_T(k) \\approx \\frac{\\pi^4}{k^2} + 2\\pi^2 + \\mathrm{Le}\\,\\mathrm{Ra}_S $$\nThis expression provides the asymptotic behavior of the marginal stability curve for large-scale convection cells.\n\nFor the physical interpretation of the $k^0$ correction, we examine the constant term in the expansion, which is $(2\\pi^2 + \\mathrm{Le}\\,\\mathrm{Ra}_S)$. The term $\\mathrm{Le}\\,\\mathrm{Ra}_S$ represents the contribution of the solute field. The problem specifies that the concentration is higher at the bottom plate and that $\\beta_S > 0$, implying the solute makes the fluid denser. This constitutes a stabilizing density gradient. Consequently, the solutal Rayleigh number $\\mathrm{Ra}_S$ is positive. The Lewis number $\\mathrm{Le}$ is also positive. Therefore, the product $\\mathrm{Le}\\,\\mathrm{Ra}_S$ is a positive quantity that adds to the required thermal Rayleigh number $\\mathrm{Ra}_T$ to initiate convection. This signifies a stabilizing effect of the solute field. The fact that this term is of order $k^0$ indicates that this stabilizing influence is present for all modes, including those of very long wavelength ($k \\to 0$), and its magnitude to this order of approximation does not depend on the spatial scale of the convection cells. It represents a bulk resistance to overturning that must be overcome by thermal buoyancy, in addition to the effects of thermal diffusion and the geometric constraints of the layer.", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{\\frac{\\pi^4}{k^2} + 2\\pi^2 + \\mathrm{Le}\\,\\mathrm{Ra}_{S}} $$", "id": "2478630"}, {"introduction": "Linear stability theory predicts the initial exponential growth of an instability, but not the final amplitude of the convective state.

The problem models the primary fingering instability as an array of vertical jets with a vertical velocity field given by\n$$w(x,t) \\approx W(t)\\,\\sin(k_f x)$$\nThe lateral shear created by this velocity field is the horizontal gradient of the vertical velocity, $\\frac{\\partial w}{\\partial x}$.

Therefore, the solution will be provided.\n\n---\n\nThe solution proceeds by following the five specified parts.\n\n**Part 1: Characteristic wavenumber for salinity, $k_{B}$**\n\nThe smallest scales of a scalar field, such as salinity, are determined by a balance between the straining action of the smallest turbulent eddies and the dissipative action of molecular diffusion. The rate of strain at the smallest scales of the velocity field (the viscous range) is given by the inverse of the Kolmogorov time scale, $\\tau_K^{-1}$, where $\\tau_K = (\\nu/\\epsilon)^{1/2}$ and $\\epsilon$ is the turbulent kinetic energy dissipation rate per unit mass. Let us denote this characteristic strain rate as $\\gamma_K \\equiv \\tau_K^{-1}$.\n\nThe problem states that the production of small-scale scalar gradients is driven by this strain rate, $\\gamma_K$. The destruction of these same gradients by molecular diffusion occurs at a rate proportional to $D k^2$, where $k$ is the wavenumber of the scalar fluctuation. The Batchelor wavenumber, $k_{B}$, represents the scale at which these two processes are in equilibrium.\n\nEquating the straining rate to the diffusion rate:\n$$\n\\gamma_K = D k_{B}^2\n$$\nSolving for the characteristic wavenumber $k_{B}$ gives:\n$$\nk_{B} = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\gamma_K}{D}}\n$$\nThis expression identifies the wavenumber at which the sharpening of gradients by strain is balanced by their smoothing by diffusion.\n\n**Part 2: Salinity Batchelor scale, $\\eta_{B}$, in terms of $\\eta_K$ and $\\mathrm{Sc}$**\n\nThe Batchelor length scale for salinity, $\\eta_{B}$, is defined as the inverse of the characteristic wavenumber:\n$$\n\\eta_{B} \\equiv \\frac{1}{k_{B}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{D}{\\gamma_K}}\n$$\nThe Kolmogorov length scale, $\\eta_K$, is defined as $\\eta_K = (\\nu^3/\\epsilon)^{1/4}$. We must relate the strain rate $\\gamma_K = (\\epsilon/\\nu)^{1/2}$ to $\\eta_K$. From the definition of $\\eta_K$, we can write $\\epsilon = \\nu^3/\\eta_K^4$. Substituting this into the expression for $\\gamma_K$:\n$$\n\\gamma_K = \\left(\\frac{\\nu^3/\\eta_K^4}{\\nu}\\right)^{1/2} = \\left(\\frac{\\nu^2}{\\eta_K^4}\\right)^{1/2} = \\frac{\\nu}{\\eta_K^2}\n$$\nNow, we substitute this expression for $\\gamma_K$ into the equation for $\\eta_{B}$:\n$$\n\\eta_{B} = \\sqrt{\\frac{D}{\\nu/\\eta_K^2}} = \\eta_K \\sqrt{\\frac{D}{\\nu}}\n$$\nThe Schmidt number for salinity is defined as $\\mathrm{Sc} = \\nu/D$. Therefore, $D/\\nu = 1/\\mathrm{Sc}$. The expression for the Batchelor scale becomes:\n$$\n\\eta_{B} = \\eta_K \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{\\mathrm{Sc}}} = \\eta_K (\\mathrm{Sc})^{-1/2}\n$$\n\n**Part 3: Expression for $\\eta_{B}$ in terms of $\\eta_K$, $\\mathrm{Pr}$, and $\\mathrm{Le}$**\n\nThe Schmidt number $\\mathrm{Sc}$ is to be expressed in terms of the Prandtl number $\\mathrm{Pr} = \\nu/\\alpha$ and the Lewis number $\\mathrm{Le} = \\alpha/D$. We can write $\\mathrm{Sc}$ as the product of $\\mathrm{Pr}$ and $\\mathrm{Le}$:\n$$\n\\mathrm{Sc} = \\frac{\\nu}{D} = \\frac{\\nu}{\\alpha} \\cdot \\frac{\\alpha}{D} = \\mathrm{Pr} \\cdot \\mathrm{Le}\n$$\nSubstituting this result into the expression for $\\eta_{B}$ from Part 2 yields the final closed-form expression:\n$$\n\\eta_{B} = \\eta_K (\\mathrm{Pr} \\cdot \\mathrm{Le})^{-1/2}\n$$\n\n**Part 4: Minimum grid spacing, $\\Delta x_{\\min}$**\n\nThe Nyquist sampling theorem requires that, to resolve a feature of characteristic size $\\ell$, the sampling interval (here, the grid spacing $\\Delta x$) must be no larger than half the feature size: $\\Delta x \\le \\ell/2$. The smallest dynamically active scale for salinity is the Batchelor scale, $\\eta_{B}$. Therefore, to resolve the salinity field in a DNS, we must satisfy $\\Delta x \\le \\eta_{B}/2$.\n\nThe problem asks for the minimum grid spacing $\\Delta x_{\\min}$ required. In the context of DNS resolution requirements, this typically refers to the coarsest possible grid that still satisfies the resolution criterion. We thus take the equality:\n$$\n\\Delta x_{\\min} = \\frac{\\eta_{B}}{2}\n$$\nSubstituting the expression for $\\eta_{B}$ from Part 3 gives the required expression for $\\Delta x_{\\min}$:\n$$\n\\Delta x_{\\min} = \\frac{\\eta_K}{2} (\\mathrm{Pr} \\cdot \\mathrm{Le})^{-1/2} = \\frac{\\eta_K}{2\\sqrt{\\mathrm{Pr} \\cdot \\mathrm{Le}}}\n$$\n\n**Part 5: Numerical estimates and feasibility assessment**\n\nWe are given the following numerical values: $\\eta_K = 3.0 \\times 10^{-4}$ m, $\\mathrm{Pr} = 7.0$, $\\mathrm{Le} = 140$, and domain side length $L = 0.50$ m. The calculations are performed and results are rounded to three significant figures as requested.\n\nFirst, calculate the required grid spacing $\\Delta x_{\\min}$:\n$$\n\\Delta x_{\\min} = \\frac{3.0 \\times 10^{-4}}{2\\sqrt{7.0 \\cdot 140}} = \\frac{3.0 \\times 10^{-4}}{2\\sqrt{980}} \\approx \\frac{3.0 \\times 10^{-4}}{2 \\cdot 31.305} \\approx 4.7915 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\text{m}\n$$\nRounding to three significant figures, $\\Delta x_{\\min} \\approx 4.79 \\times 10^{-6}$ m.\n\nNext, calculate the number of grid points per side, $N$:\n$$\nN = \\frac{L}{\\Delta x_{\\min}} = \\frac{0.50}{4.7915 \\times 10^{-6}} \\approx 104351\n$$\nRounding to three significant figures, $N \\approx 1.04 \\times 10^5$.\n\nThen, calculate the total number of grid cells, $N^3$:\n$$\nN^3 = (104351)^3 \\approx 1.136 \\times 10^{15}\n$$\nRounding to three significant figures, $N^3 \\approx 1.14 \\times 10^{15}$ cells.\n\nFinally, assess the feasibility. The required number of cells is $1.14 \\times 10^{15}$. The available computing resources can accommodate at most $1.0 \\times 10^{11}$ cells. Since:\n$$\n1.14 \\times 10^{15} \\gg 1.0 \\times 10^{11}\n$$\nThe required number of cells exceeds the available resources by more than four orders of magnitude.\n\nConclusion: The DNS as specified is **not feasible** with the available computational resources.", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{\\frac{\\eta_K}{2\\sqrt{\\mathrm{Pr} \\cdot \\mathrm{Le}}}} $$", "id": "2478604"}]}
