It presents a valid inquiry into the fundamental assumptions of the Boussinesq approximation in the context of Rayleigh–Bénard convection. We shall proceed with the derivation and analysis.\n\nThe objective is to derive a dimensionless number that quantifies the relative error introduced by the Boussinesq approximation, specifically by treating the fluid density $\\rho$ as constant in terms where it is not coupled to gravity. The primary equation where this simplification is made is the mass conservation (continuity) equation.\n\nThe exact mass conservation equation is:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial \\rho}{\\partial t} + \\nabla \\cdot (\\rho \\mathbf{u}) = 0\n$$\nwhere $\\mathbf{u}$ is the velocity field. Expanding the divergence term yields:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial \\rho}{\\partial t} + \\mathbf{u} \\cdot \\nabla \\rho + \\rho (\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{u}) = 0\n$$\nThe first two terms constitute the material derivative of density, $\\frac{D\\rho}{Dt}$. Thus, the equation can be written as:\n$$\n\\frac{D\\rho}{Dt} + \\rho (\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{u}) = 0\n$$\nThe Boussinesq approximation for the continuity equation simplifies this to $\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{u} = 0$, which is the condition for an incompressible fluid. This simplification implies that the term $\\frac{D\\rho}{Dt}$ is considered negligible. The error in this approximation is therefore embodied in the non-zero velocity divergence that is being ignored. From the exact equation, this divergence is:\n$$\n\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{u} = -\\frac{1}{\\rho} \\frac{D\\rho}{Dt}\n$$\nTo estimate the magnitude of this term, we must relate the change in density to the change in temperature. The problem specifies the use of the isobaric volumetric thermal expansion coefficient, $\\beta$, defined as:\n$$\n\\beta = -\\frac{1}{\\rho} \\left(\\frac{\\partial \\rho}{\\partial T}\\right)_P\n$$\nwhere the subscript $P$ indicates constant pressure. The material derivative of density, assuming pressure variations have a negligible effect on density compared to temperature variations (a core tenet of the Boussinesq approximation), is:\n$$\n\\frac{D\\rho}{Dt} \\approx \\left(\\frac{\\partial \\rho}{\\partial T}\\right)_P \\frac{DT}{Dt}\n$$\nwhere $\\frac{DT}{Dt}$ is the material derivative of temperature. Substituting the definition of $\\beta$:\n$$\n\\frac{D\\rho}{Dt} \\approx (-\\rho \\beta) \\frac{DT}{Dt}\n$$\nNow, substituting this result back into the expression for the velocity divergence:\n$$\n\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{u} = -\\frac{1}{\\rho} \\left( -\\rho \\beta \\frac{DT}{Dt} \\right) = \\beta \\frac{DT}{Dt}\n$$\nThe term $\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{u}$ represents the local rate of volumetric expansion or compression (volumetric strain rate). The Boussinesq approximation is valid if this term is small compared to other characteristic velocity gradients, such as shear strain rates. We perform a scaling analysis to find this relative magnitude.\n\nLet $U$ be a characteristic velocity scale, $d$ be the characteristic length scale (the layer thickness), and $\\Delta T$ be the characteristic temperature difference across the layer. The material derivative of temperature is $\\frac{DT}{Dt} = \\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial t} + \\mathbf{u} \\cdot \\nabla T$. In a convection problem, the characteristic time scale is advective, so both terms have the same order of magnitude. We scale the advective term:\n$$\n|\\mathbf{u} \\cdot \\nabla T| \\sim U \\frac{\\Delta T}{d}\n$$\nTherefore, the magnitude of the velocity divergence scales as:\n$$\n|\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{u}| \\sim \\beta \\left| \\frac{DT}{Dt} \\right| \\sim \\beta U \\frac{\\Delta T}{d}\n$$\nThis is the scale of the volumetric strain rate that is neglected. Now, we must compare this to a characteristic velocity gradient that is retained in the model, for example, a shear strain rate component of the velocity gradient tensor $\\nabla \\mathbf{u}$. A typical component scales as:\n$$\n\\left| \\frac{\\partial u_i}{\\partial x_j} \\right| \\sim \\frac{U}{d} \\quad (\\text{for } i \\neq j)\n$$\nThe dimensionless number that quantifies the relative magnitude of the error is the ratio of the scale of the neglected volumetric strain rate to the scale of the retained shear strain rates:\n$$\n\\text{Error} \\sim \\frac{|\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{u}|}{| \\partial u_i / \\partial x_j |} \\sim \\frac{\\beta U \\frac{\\Delta T}{d}}{\\frac{U}{d}} = \\beta \\Delta T\n$$\nThis dimensionless product, $\\beta \\Delta T$, represents the characteristic fractional change in density across the fluid layer and is the parameter that determines the validity of the Boussinesq approximation. The approximation is valid when $\\beta \\Delta T \\ll 1$.\n\nWe now evaluate this number for the given conditions.\nGiven data:\nIsobaric volumetric thermal expansion coefficient of water, $\\beta \\approx 2.1 \\times 10^{-4}\\ \\mathrm{K}^{-1}$.\nTemperature difference across the layer, $\\Delta T = 10\\ \\mathrm{K}$.\n\nThe dimensionless number is:\n$$\n\\beta \\Delta T = (2.1 \\times 10^{-4}\\ \\mathrm{K}^{-1}) \\times (10\\ \\mathrm{K}) = 2.1 \\times 10^{-3}\n$$\nRounding to three significant figures, the value is $2.10 \\times 10^{-3}$.\n\nThis value of $2.10 \\times 10^{-3}$ is much less than $1$. This signifies that the maximum relative density variation is approximately $0.21\\%$. The error introduced by assuming the fluid is incompressible and by neglecting density variations in non-buoyancy terms is therefore very small. Consequently, the Boussinesq approximation is highly acceptable for modeling Rayleigh–Bénard convection under these specified conditions.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{2.10 \\times 10^{-3}}$$", "id": "2519880"}, {"introduction": "The principles of buoyancy-driven instability extend beyond simple fluids to more complex environments.

A solution will be formulated.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe analysis begins with the fundamental balance equations for mass, momentum, and energy in a porous medium, subject to the stated assumptions. A Cartesian coordinate system is established with the $z$-axis pointing vertically upward, originating from the bottom boundary at $z=0$. The top boundary is at $z=H$.\n\nThe governing equations are:\n1.  **Mass Conservation (for an incompressible fluid)**:\n    $$ \\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{v} = 0 $$\n    where $\\mathbf{v}$ is the Darcy velocity vector.\n\n2.  **Momentum Conservation (Darcy's Law with Boussinesq approximation)**:\n    Within the Boussinesq approximation, the fluid density $\\rho$ is considered constant except in the buoyancy term, where it is a linear function of temperature: $\\rho = \\rho_0(1 - \\beta (T - T_0))$, where $\\rho_0$ is a reference density at a reference temperature $T_0$. The momentum balance is given by:\n    $$ \\frac{\\mu}{K} \\mathbf{v} = -\\nabla p + \\rho \\mathbf{g} $$\n    Here, $p$ is the pressure, $\\mu$ is the dynamic viscosity, $K$ is the permeability, and $\\mathbf{g} = -g \\mathbf{\\hat{k}}$ is the gravitational acceleration vector. Substituting the density relation and separating the pressure into a hydrostatic part ($p_{hydro}$, where $\\nabla p_{hydro} = \\rho_0 \\mathbf{g}$) and a dynamic part ($p'$), the equation becomes:\n    $$ \\frac{\\mu}{K} \\mathbf{v} = -\\nabla p' + (\\rho - \\rho_0)\\mathbf{g} = -\\nabla p' - \\rho_0 \\beta (T - T_0) g \\mathbf{\\hat{k}} $$\n\n3.  **Energy Conservation**:\n    Under the assumption of local thermal equilibrium and negligible solid conductivity, the energy balance is written as:\n    $$ \\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial t} + \\mathbf{v} \\cdot \\nabla T = \\kappa \\nabla^2 T $$\n    where $\\kappa = k_f / (\\rho c_p)$ is the thermal diffusivity of the fluid, used as the effective thermal diffusivity of the saturated medium per assumption (iv).\n\nThe onset of convection is analyzed by considering perturbations around the static, pure conduction state. This base state has no flow ($\\mathbf{v}_b = 0$) and a linear temperature profile:\n$$ T_b(z) = T_h - \\frac{\\Delta T}{H}z $$\nwhere $T_h$ is the temperature at the bottom boundary ($z=0$) and $\\Delta T = T_h - T_c > 0$.\n\nLet the perturbed state be $T = T_b + \\theta$, $p' = p'_p$, and $\\mathbf{v} = \\mathbf{v}'$, where $\\theta$, $p'_p$, and $\\mathbf{v}'$ are small perturbations. We set the reference temperature $T_0$ to align with the base state temperature at some point, simplifying the buoyancy term. The linearized equations for the perturbations become:\n$$ \\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{v}' = 0 $$\n$$ \\frac{\\mu}{K} \\mathbf{v}' = -\\nabla p'_p + \\rho_0 g \\beta \\theta \\mathbf{\\hat{k}} $$\n$$ \\frac{\\partial \\theta}{\\partial t} + \\mathbf{v}' \\cdot \\nabla T_b = \\kappa \\nabla^2 \\theta $$\nThe advection of the base temperature gradient is $\\mathbf{v}' \\cdot \\nabla T_b = w' \\frac{dT_b}{dz} = -w' \\frac{\\Delta T}{H}$, where $w'$ is the vertical component of $\\mathbf{v}'$. The energy equation for the perturbation is:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial \\theta}{\\partial t} - w' \\frac{\\Delta T}{H} = \\kappa \\nabla^2 \\theta $$\n\nA scaling analysis is performed on the steady-state ($\\partial/\\partial t = 0$) perturbation equations to determine the dimensionless group governing the onset of convection. Let $W$ and $\\Theta$ be the characteristic scales for the vertical velocity $w'$ and temperature perturbation $\\theta$, respectively. The characteristic length scale is the layer height $H$.\n\nFrom the momentum equation (vertical component), a balance is established between the Darcy drag and the buoyancy force:\n$$ \\frac{\\mu}{K} W \\sim \\rho_0 g \\beta \\Theta $$\nThis relation connects the characteristic velocity and temperature scales:\n$$ \\Theta \\sim \\frac{\\mu W}{K \\rho_0 g \\beta} $$\n\nFrom the steady-state energy equation, a balance is established between the advection of the background temperature gradient and the diffusion of the temperature perturbation:\n$$ W \\frac{\\Delta T}{H} \\sim \\kappa \\frac{\\Theta}{H^2} $$\nThe term $\\nabla^2 \\theta$ is scaled as $\\Theta/H^2$, assuming the horizontal and vertical length scales of the convection cells are comparable to $H$.\n\nSubstituting the expression for $\\Theta$ from the momentum balance into the scaled energy equation yields:\n$$ W \\frac{\\Delta T}{H} \\sim \\kappa \\frac{1}{H^2} \\left( \\frac{\\mu W}{K \\rho_0 g \\beta} \\right) $$\nThe velocity scale $W$ cancels, indicating that the condition for the onset of motion represents a marginal stability criterion independent of the perturbation amplitude. Rearranging the terms to form a dimensionless group gives:\n$$ \\frac{\\rho_0 g \\beta \\Delta T K H}{\\mu \\kappa} \\sim 1 $$\nThis dimensionless group is the Rayleigh–Darcy number, $Ra_D$. Using the definitions for kinematic viscosity, $\\nu = \\mu/\\rho_0$, the expression is:\n$$ Ra_D = \\frac{g \\beta \\Delta T K H}{\\nu \\kappa} $$\nThis expression represents the ratio of the time scale of heat diffusion to the time scale of buoyant fluid motion. Convection is expected to occur when $Ra_D$ exceeds a critical value, which for this specific boundary configuration is $4\\pi^2$. The problem only asks for the governing dimensionless group and its value for the given data, not the critical value for instability.\n\n### Numerical Calculation\n\nThe next task is to compute the value of $Ra_D$ using the provided data. First, the kinematic viscosity $\\nu$ and thermal diffusivity $\\kappa$ must be calculated.\n\n1.  **Kinematic viscosity $\\nu$**:\n    $$ \\nu = \\frac{\\mu}{\\rho} = \\frac{8.90 \\times 10^{-4}\\ \\mathrm{Pa}\\ \\mathrm{s}}{997\\ \\mathrm{kg}\\ \\mathrm{m}^{-3}} \\approx 8.92678 \\times 10^{-7}\\ \\mathrm{m}^2 \\mathrm{s}^{-1} $$\n\n2.  **Thermal diffusivity $\\kappa$**:\n    $$ \\kappa = \\frac{k_f}{\\rho c_p} = \\frac{0.600\\ \\mathrm{W}\\ \\mathrm{m}^{-1}\\ \\mathrm{K}^{-1}}{(997\\ \\mathrm{kg}\\ \\mathrm{m}^{-3})(4180\\ \\mathrm{J}\\ \\mathrm{kg}^{-1}\\ \\mathrm{K}^{-1})} \\approx 1.43972 \\times 10^{-7}\\ \\mathrm{m}^2 \\mathrm{s}^{-1} $$\n\n3.  **Rayleigh–Darcy number $Ra_D$**:\n    The values are substituted into the derived expression for $Ra_D$:\n    $$ Ra_D = \\frac{g \\beta \\Delta T K H}{\\nu \\kappa} $$\n    $$ Ra_D = \\frac{(9.81\\ \\mathrm{m}\\ \\mathrm{s}^{-2})(2.50 \\times 10^{-4}\\ \\mathrm{K}^{-1})(10.0\\ \\mathrm{K})(1.00 \\times 10^{-9}\\ \\mathrm{m}^2)(0.050\\ \\mathrm{m})}{(8.92678 \\times 10^{-7}\\ \\mathrm{m}^2 \\mathrm{s}^{-1})(1.43972 \\times 10^{-7}\\ \\mathrm{m}^2 \\mathrm{s}^{-1})} $$\n    Numerator calculation:\n    $$ (9.81)(2.50 \\times 10^{-4})(10.0)(1.00 \\times 10^{-9})(0.050) = 1.22625 \\times 10^{-12}\\ \\mathrm{m}^4 \\mathrm{s}^{-2} $$\n    Denominator calculation:\n    $$ (8.92678 \\times 10^{-7})(1.43972 \\times 10^{-7}) = 1.28522 \\times 10^{-13}\\ \\mathrm{m}^4 \\mathrm{s}^{-2} $$\n    $$ Ra_D = \\frac{1.22625 \\times 10^{-12}}{1.28522 \\times 10^{-13}} \\approx 9.54119 $$\n    As instructed, the result is rounded to three significant figures.\n    $$ Ra_D \\approx 9.54 $$\nThis value is below the critical Rayleigh-Darcy number of $4\\pi^2 \\approx 39.5$, which indicates that for the given parameters, the system would remain in the pure conduction state and not exhibit buoyancy-driven convection.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{9.54}$$", "id": "2519834"}, {"introduction": "On planetary scales, such as in Earth's oceans and atmosphere, rotation profoundly influences fluid motion.

The dimensionless group that quantifies the importance of the Coriolis force relative to viscous diffusion is therefore the prefactor of the Coriolis term, $\\frac{2\\Omega H^2}{\\nu}$.\n\nThe Taylor number, $Ta$, is conventionally defined as the square of this ratio:\n$$ Ta = \\left(\\frac{2\\Omega H^2}{\\nu}\\right)^2 = \\frac{4\\Omega^2 H^4}{\\nu^2} $$\nWe now compute its numerical value using the provided parameters:\n$$ H = 8.0 \\times 10^{-3}\\ \\mathrm{m}, \\quad \\nu = 1.0 \\times 10^{-6}\\ \\mathrm{m}^{2}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}, \\quad \\Omega = 20\\ \\mathrm{rad}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1} $$\n$$ Ta = \\frac{4(20)^2 (8.0 \\times 10^{-3})^4}{(1.0 \\times 10^{-6})^2} = \\frac{4(400)(4096 \\times 10^{-12})}{1.0 \\times 10^{-12}} = 1600 \\times 4096 = 6,553,600 $$\nRounding to three significant figures, we get $Ta = 6.55 \\times 10^6$.\n\nNext, we estimate the critical Rayleigh number, $Ra_c$. The problem states that the system is in the rapid-rotation regime ($Ta \\gg 1$) and has rigid, isothermal boundaries. For this specific case, the onset of stationary convection is described by a well-established asymptotic scaling law. The critical Rayleigh number scales with the Taylor number to the power of $2/3$:\n$$ Ra_c(Ta) \\approx C \\cdot Ta^{2/3} $$\nThe constant of proportionality, $C$, has been determined through detailed asymptotic analysis and numerical computation. For rigid, perfectly conducting boundaries, the accepted value is $C \\approx 8.696$. Thus, the relation we apply is:\n$$ Ra_c \\approx 8.696 \\cdot Ta^{2/3} $$\nThis scaling law is valid in the limit $Ta \\to \\infty$, and our calculated value $Ta \\approx 6.55 \\times 10^6$ is sufficiently large for this approximation to be accurate.\n\nUsing the unrounded value of $Ta$ for precision, we compute $Ra_c$:\n$$ Ra_c \\approx 8.696 \\times (6,553,600)^{2/3} $$\n$$ Ra_c \\approx 8.696 \\times (35055.57\\dots) $$\n$$ Ra_c \\approx 304,843.0\\dots $$\nRounding this result to three significant figures gives $Ra_c = 3.05 \\times 10^5$.\n\nThe final answer is the ordered pair $(Ta, Ra_c)$, with both values rounded to three significant figures.", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{(6.55 \\times 10^{6}, 3.05 \\times 10^{5})} $$", "id": "2519838"}]}
