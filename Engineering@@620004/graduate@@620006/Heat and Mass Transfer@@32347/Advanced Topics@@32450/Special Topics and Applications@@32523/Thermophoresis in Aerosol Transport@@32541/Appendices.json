No flaws are identified. The problem is declared **valid**, and the solution will now be derived.\n\nThe first objective is to find the particle deposition flux $J$. The governing transport equation is\n$$\nJ = - D_{p} \\frac{dc}{dy} + c v_{T}\n$$\nThis is a first-order, linear, non-homogeneous ordinary differential equation for the concentration $c(y)$. With $J$, $D_p$, and $v_T$ being constant, it can be rearranged as:\n$$\n\\frac{dc}{dy} - \\frac{v_{T}}{D_{p}} c = -\\frac{J}{D_{p}}\n$$\nThe integrating factor is $I(y) = \\exp\\left(\\int -\\frac{v_{T}}{D_{p}} dy\\right) = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{v_{T}y}{D_{p}}\\right)$. Multiplying the differential equation by $I(y)$ yields:\n$$\n\\frac{d}{dy}\\left( c(y) \\exp\\left(-\\frac{v_{T}y}{D_{p}}\\right) \\right) = -\\frac{J}{D_{p}} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{v_{T}y}{D_{p}}\\right)\n$$\nIntegrating with respect to $y$:\n$$\nc(y) \\exp\\left(-\\frac{v_{T}y}{D_{p}}\\right) = -\\frac{J}{D_{p}} \\int \\exp\\left(-\\frac{v_{T}y}{D_{p}}\\right) dy = -\\frac{J}{D_{p}} \\left( \\frac{\\exp\\left(-\\frac{v_{T}y}{D_{p}}\\right)}{-v_{T}/D_{p}} \\right) + C_{1}\n$$\nwhere $C_1$ is the constant of integration. Simplifying, we obtain:\n$$\nc(y) \\exp\\left(-\\frac{v_{T}y}{D_{p}}\\right) = \\frac{J}{v_{T}} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{v_{T}y}{D_{p}}\\right) + C_{1}\n$$\nThe general solution for the concentration profile is:\n$$\nc(y) = \\frac{J}{v_{T}} + C_{1} \\exp\\left(\\frac{v_{T}y}{D_{p}}\\right)\n$$\nThe constants $C_1$ and $J$ are determined from the boundary conditions.\nApplying the wall boundary condition $c(0)=0$:\n$$\n0 = \\frac{J}{v_{T}} + C_{1} \\exp(0) \\implies C_{1} = -\\frac{J}{v_{T}}\n$$\nSubstituting $C_1$ back into the general solution gives:\n$$\nc(y) = \\frac{J}{v_{T}} \\left(1 - \\exp\\left(\\frac{v_{T}y}{D_{p}}\\right)\\right)\n$$\nTo apply the far-field boundary condition $\\lim_{y\\to\\infty} c(y) = c_{\\infty}$, we must determine the sign of $v_{T}$. The wall is cold and the temperature increases for $y>0$, so $G > 0$. Thermophoresis drives particles from hot to cold regions, so the drift velocity must be directed towards the wall, i.e., in the negative $y$-direction. Thus, $v_{T} < 0$. This is consistent with the provided formula $v_{T} = - \\alpha_{T} \\nu \\frac{G}{T_{w}} f(\\mathrm{Kn})$, as all quantities on the right-hand side are positive.\nSince $v_{T} < 0$ and $D_{p} > 0$, the argument of the exponential, $\\frac{v_{T}y}{D_{p}}$, is negative. Therefore, as $y \\to \\infty$, the exponential term vanishes:\n$$\n\\lim_{y\\to\\infty} \\exp\\left(\\frac{v_{T}y}{D_{p}}\\right) = 0\n$$\nApplying this limit to the solution for $c(y)$:\n$$\n\\lim_{y\\to\\infty} c(y) = \\frac{J}{v_{T}} (1 - 0) = \\frac{J}{v_{T}}\n$$\nEquating this with the given far-field condition gives $c_{\\infty} = \\frac{J}{v_{T}}$.\nSolving for the deposition flux $J$, we find the first required result:\n$$\nJ = c_{\\infty} v_{T}\n$$\nThe second objective is to perform a sensitivity analysis. The full expression for the flux is:\n$$\nJ = - c_{\\infty} \\alpha_{T} \\nu \\frac{G}{T_{w}} f(\\mathrm{Kn}) = - c_{\\infty} \\alpha_{T} \\nu \\frac{G}{T_{w}} \\frac{\\mathrm{Kn}}{1+\\mathrm{Kn}}\n$$\nThe normalized local sensitivity of $J$ with respect to a parameter $x$ is $S_{x} = \\frac{x}{J} \\frac{\\partial J}{\\partial x}$.\n\nFirst, we compute the sensitivity with respect to $\\alpha_{T}$:\n$$\nS_{\\alpha_{T}} = \\frac{\\alpha_{T}}{J} \\frac{\\partial J}{\\partial \\alpha_{T}}\n$$\nThe partial derivative of $J$ with respect to $\\alpha_{T}$ is:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial J}{\\partial \\alpha_{T}} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\alpha_{T}} \\left( - c_{\\infty} \\alpha_{T} \\nu \\frac{G}{T_{w}} f(\\mathrm{Kn}) \\right) = - c_{\\infty} \\nu \\frac{G}{T_{w}} f(\\mathrm{Kn}) = \\frac{J}{\\alpha_{T}}\n$$\nSubstituting this into the sensitivity formula:\n$$\nS_{\\alpha_{T}} = \\frac{\\alpha_{T}}{J} \\left( \\frac{J}{\\alpha_{T}} \\right) = 1\n$$\nThis result is independent of the parameter values. The flux is directly proportional to the thermal accommodation parameter.\n\nNext, we compute the sensitivity with respect to $\\mathrm{Kn}$:\n$$\nS_{\\mathrm{Kn}} = \\frac{\\mathrm{Kn}}{J} \\frac{\\partial J}{\\partial \\mathrm{Kn}}\n$$\nThe partial derivative of $J$ with respect to $\\mathrm{Kn}$ is found using the quotient rule for $f(\\mathrm{Kn})$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial J}{\\partial \\mathrm{Kn}} = \\left( - c_{\\infty} \\alpha_{T} \\nu \\frac{G}{T_{w}} \\right) \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\mathrm{Kn}} \\left( \\frac{\\mathrm{Kn}}{1+\\mathrm{Kn}} \\right) = \\left( \\frac{J}{f(\\mathrm{Kn})} \\right) \\left( \\frac{(1)(1+\\mathrm{Kn}) - (\\mathrm{Kn})(1)}{(1+\\mathrm{Kn})^{2}} \\right)\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial J}{\\partial \\mathrm{Kn}} = \\left( J \\frac{1+\\mathrm{Kn}}{\\mathrm{Kn}} \\right) \\left( \\frac{1}{(1+\\mathrm{Kn})^{2}} \\right) = \\frac{J}{\\mathrm{Kn}(1+\\mathrm{Kn})}\n$$\nSubstituting this into the sensitivity formula:\n$$\nS_{\\mathrm{Kn}} = \\frac{\\mathrm{Kn}}{J} \\left( \\frac{J}{\\mathrm{Kn}(1+\\mathrm{Kn})} \\right) = \\frac{1}{1+\\mathrm{Kn}}\n$$\nNow, we must evaluate these sensitivities at the baseline point $\\alpha_{T,0} = 0.9$ and $\\mathrm{Kn}_{0} = 0.3$.\nThe sensitivity $S_{\\alpha_{T}}$ is constant:\n$$\nS_{\\alpha_{T}} = 1.000\n$$\nThe sensitivity $S_{\\mathrm{Kn}}$ is evaluated at $\\mathrm{Kn} = \\mathrm{Kn}_{0} = 0.3$:\n$$\nS_{\\mathrm{Kn}} = \\frac{1}{1+0.3} = \\frac{1}{1.3} \\approx 0.7692307...\n$$\nRounding to four significant figures, we get $S_{\\mathrm{Kn}} = 0.7692$.\nThe final answer is to be reported as the row matrix $(S_{\\alpha_{T}}, S_{\\mathrm{Kn}})$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n1.000 & 0.7692\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "2533358"}]}
