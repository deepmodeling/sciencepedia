We may proceed with the solution.\n\nThe problem requires a three-part analysis based on the principles of dimensional analysis.\n\nPart 1: Construction of the turbulence time scale $\\tau$.\nThe problem states that the characteristic time scale, $\\tau$, of the smallest dissipative turbulent eddies depends only on the turbulent kinetic energy dissipation rate, $\\epsilon$, and the kinematic viscosity, $\\nu$. We are to construct this time scale.\n\nFirst, we must establish the dimensions of the governing parameters. The dimensions are denoted by $M$ for mass, $L$ for length, and $T$ for time.\nThe turbulent kinetic energy dissipation rate, $\\epsilon$, has units of energy per unit mass per unit time, which is equivalent to $(\\mathrm{m^2/s^2})/\\mathrm{s} = \\mathrm{m^2 \\ s^{-3}}$. In fundamental dimensions, this is $[\\epsilon] = L^2 T^{-3}$.\nThe kinematic viscosity, $\\nu$, has units of $\\mathrm{m^2 \\ s^{-1}}$. Its dimensions are $[\\nu] = L^2 T^{-1}$.\n\nWe seek a combination of $\\epsilon$ and $\\nu$ that results in a quantity with the dimension of time, $[T]$. We can express this relationship as a power-law proportionality:\n$$ \\tau \\propto \\epsilon^a \\nu^b $$\nwhere $a$ and $b$ are dimensionless exponents to be determined. In terms of dimensions, this equation becomes:\n$$ [T] = [\\epsilon]^a [\\nu]^b $$\n$$ T^1 L^0 = (L^2 T^{-3})^a (L^2 T^{-1})^b $$\n$$ T^1 L^0 = L^{2a+2b} T^{-3a-b} $$\n\nFor this dimensional equation to be consistent, the exponents of each fundamental dimension ($L$ and $T$) must be equal on both sides of the equation. This yields a system of two linear algebraic equations for $a$ and $b$:\n1. For length ($L$): $2a + 2b = 0$\n2. For time ($T$): $-3a - b = 1$\n\nFrom equation (1), we find that $a = -b$. Substituting this result into equation (2):\n$$ -3(-b) - b = 1 $$\n$$ 3b - b = 1 $$\n$$ 2b = 1 \\implies b = \\frac{1}{2} $$\nSince $a = -b$, it follows that $a = -\\frac{1}{2}$.\n\nTherefore, the time scale $\\tau$ is proportional to $\\epsilon^{-1/2} \\nu^{1/2}$. We can write this as:\n$$ \\tau = k \\left(\\frac{\\nu}{\\epsilon}\\right)^{\\frac{1}{2}} $$\nwhere $k$ is a dimensionless constant of proportionality. This time scale is known in turbulence theory as the Kolmogorov time scale, $\\tau_k$.\n\nPart 2: Scaling of the surface renewal rate $s$.\nThe surface renewal rate, $s$, is defined as the mean rate at which interfacial surface elements are replaced. By its definition as a rate, its dimensions are inverse time, $[s] = T^{-1}$.\n\nThe problem posits that the renewal process is controlled by the turbulence time scale $\\tau$ derived above. The most direct and simplest physical model relates the rate of a process to the inverse of its characteristic time scale. Therefore, we make the modeling assumption that the surface renewal rate $s$ is inversely proportional to the Kolmogorov time scale $\\tau$:\n$$ s \\propto \\frac{1}{\\tau} $$\nSubstituting the expression for $\\tau$:\n$$ s \\propto \\frac{1}{k \\left(\\frac{\\nu}{\\epsilon}\\right)^{\\frac{1}{2}}} = \\frac{1}{k} \\left(\\frac{\\epsilon}{\\nu}\\right)^{\\frac{1}{2}} $$\nLetting $C = 1/k$ be the new dimensionless proportionality constant, the relationship is:\n$$ s = C \\left(\\frac{\\epsilon}{\\nu}\\right)^{\\frac{1}{2}} $$\nThe problem explicitly states that any undetermined dimensionless proportionality constant should be taken as unity.

A crucial first step is to use the calibration condition to relate the parameters of the two models.\n\n**1. Calibration of Models (No Reaction, $k_1=0$)**\n\nFor physical absorption without reaction, the molar flux $N_A$ is given by $N_A = k_L (C_{A,i} - C_{A,bulk})$. Assuming the bulk liquid concentration of $A$ is zero ($C_{A,bulk}=0$), this simplifies to $N_A = k_L C_{A,i}$.\n\n- **Two-Film Theory:** Transport is by steady-state diffusion across a stagnant film of thickness $\\delta$. The flux is governed by Fick's first law: $N_A = \\frac{D}{\\delta} C_{A,i}$. Equating this with the definition in terms of $k_L$ gives the mass transfer coefficient for the film model:\n$$k_{L,film} = \\frac{D}{\\delta}$$\n\n- **Surface Renewal Theory:** Transport into a surface element of age $t$ is an unsteady diffusion process. The average flux across the interface, considering the exponential age distribution of surface elements $p(t) = s e^{-st}$, is given by $N_A = C_{A,i} \\sqrt{Ds}$. Equating this with the definition in terms of $k_L$ gives the mass transfer coefficient for the Danckwerts model:\n$$k_{L,Danckwerts} = \\sqrt{Ds}$$\n\nThe problem states that both descriptions are calibrated to the same physical $k_L$. Therefore, we set $k_{L,film} = k_{L,Danckwerts} = k_L$:\n$$\\frac{D}{\\delta} = \\sqrt{Ds}$$\nThis provides the key relationship between the film thickness $\\delta$ and the surface renewal rate $s$:\n$$\\delta = \\frac{D}{\\sqrt{Ds}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{D}{s}}$$\n\n**2.

Comparison of the Two Theories**\n\nTo compare the two models under the given conditions, we must express $E_{film}$ in terms of the same parameters as $E_{Danckwerts}$. Using the calibration result $\\delta = \\sqrt{D/s}$, we can rewrite the Hatta number from the film theory:\n$$Ha = \\sqrt{\\frac{k_1 \\delta^2}{D}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{k_1 (D/s)}{D}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{k_1}{s}}$$\nThus, we are comparing the following two functions of the dimensionless group $Ha = \\sqrt{k_1/s}$:\n$$E_{film} = \\frac{Ha}{\\tanh(Ha)}$$\n$$E_{Danckwerts} = \\sqrt{1 + Ha^2}$$\n\nFor any finite, positive reaction rate ($k_1 > 0$), we have $Ha > 0$. It is a well-established mathematical inequality that for any $x>0$, $\\tanh(x) > \\frac{x}{\\sqrt{1+x^2}}$. This can be proven by analyzing the function $f(x) = \\tanh(x) - x/\\sqrt{1+x^2}$ and its derivatives. This inequality is equivalent to $\\sqrt{1+x^2} > \\frac{x}{\\tanh(x)}$. Therefore, for any $Ha > 0$:\n$$E_{Danckwerts} > E_{film}$$\nThis means the surface renewal theory consistently predicts a higher enhancement factor than the two-film theory for any non-zero reaction rate.\n\n**5. Asymptotic Behavior**\n\n- **Slow reaction limit ($Ha = \\sqrt{k_1/s} \\ll 1$):**\n  As $Ha \\to 0$:\n  Using the Taylor expansion $\\tanh(Ha) \\approx Ha - Ha^3/3 + \\dots$:\n  $$E_{film} = \\frac{Ha}{Ha(1-Ha^2/3+\\dots)} \\approx (1-Ha^2/3)^{-1} \\approx 1 + \\frac{Ha^2}{3} \\to 1$$\n  Using the binomial expansion $(1+x)^n \\approx 1+nx$:\n  $$E_{Danckwerts} = \\sqrt{1 + Ha^2} \\approx 1 + \\frac{1}{2}Ha^2 \\to 1$$\n  In the limit of very slow reaction, both models predict $E \\to 1$, meaning they asymptotically coincide.\n\n- **Fast reaction limit ($Ha = \\sqrt{k_1/s} \\gg 1$):**\n  As $Ha \\to \\infty$:\n  The hyperbolic tangent approaches its limit: $\\tanh(Ha) \\to 1$.\n  $$E_{film} = \\frac{Ha}{\\tanh(Ha)} \\to \\frac{Ha}{1} = Ha$$\n  For the surface renewal expression:\n  $$E_{Danckwerts} = \\sqrt{1 + Ha^2} = Ha\\sqrt{\\frac{1}{Ha^2} + 1} \\to Ha$$\n  In the limit of very fast reaction, both models predict $E \\approx Ha$. The absorption rate becomes $N_A = E k_L C_{A,i} \\approx Ha k_L C_{A,i} = (\\sqrt{k_1/s})(\\sqrt{Ds})C_{A,i} = \\sqrt{k_1 D}C_{A,i}$, which is independent of the hydrodynamic details ($s$ or $\\delta$). Both predictions asymptotically coincide in this limit as well.\n\n**Option-by-Option Analysis**\n\n- **A. For the same $k_1$, $D$, and $s$, both theories predict identical $E$ for all conditions.**\n  This is **Incorrect**. The functional forms $Ha/\\tanh(Ha)$ and $\\sqrt{1+Ha^2}$ are not identical for $Ha > 0$.\n\n- **B. For the same $k_1$, $D$, and $s$, the surface renewal theory predicts a larger $E$ than the two-film theory for any finite reaction rate; the two predictions asymptotically coincide when $\\sqrt{k_1/s} \\ll 1$ and when $\\sqrt{k_1/s} \\gg 1$.**\n  This is **Correct**. Our analysis shows that $E_{Danckwerts} > E_{film}$ for all $k_1 > 0$. It also shows that in the limits of very slow reaction ($Ha \\to 0$) and very fast reaction ($Ha \\to \\infty$), the predictions of the two models converge to $E=1$ and $E=Ha$ respectively.\n\n- **C. The two-film theory predicts a larger $E$ than the surface renewal theory at high reaction rates, and the two predictions coincide only when $\\sqrt{k_1/s} \\ll 1$.**\n  This is **Incorrect**. The surface renewal theory always predicts a larger $E$. Furthermore, the predictions also coincide in the high reaction rate limit ($\\sqrt{k_1/s} \\gg 1$), not just the low rate limit.\n\n- **D. The two theories do not approach each other except at exactly $k_1 = 0$, and their relative magnitude reverses as $D$ changes, even when $k_1$, $D$, and $s$ are fixed.**\n  This is **Incorrect**. The theories also approach each other for large $k_1$. The relative magnitude of $E$ depends only on the Hatta number $Ha = \\sqrt{k_1/s}$ and is independent of $D$. The premise that magnitude reverses with $D$ is false.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2496908"}]}
