A formal derivation and evaluation of options will proceed.\n\n### Derivation of the Condition for an Interior Temperature Maximum\n\nThe governing equation for thermal energy in a steady, two-dimensional, zero-pressure-gradient, compressible boundary layer, neglecting streamwise conduction and pressure work, is:\n$$\n\\rho c_p \\left( u \\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial x} + v \\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial y} \\right) = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y} \\left( k \\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial y} \\right) + \\mu \\left( \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial y} \\right)^2\n$$\nHere, $u$ and $v$ are the velocity components in the streamwise ($x$) and wall-normal ($y$) directions, respectively, $T$ is the temperature, and $\\rho$ is the density. The term on the left represents energy transport by convection. On the right, the first term is transverse heat conduction, and the second term is the viscous dissipation function, which represents the irreversible conversion of kinetic energy into internal energy due to viscous stresses and is always non-negative.\n\nAn interior temperature maximum at a location $y=y_m$ within the boundary layer is defined by the conditions:\n$$\n\\left. \\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial y} \\right|_{y=y_m} = 0 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\left. \\frac{\\partial^2 T}{\\partial y^2} \\right|_{y=y_m} < 0\n$$\nThe wall is cooled, so heat is transferred from the fluid to the wall. This requires the temperature gradient at the wall to be positive:\n$$\n\\left. \\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial y} \\right|_{y=0} > 0\n$$\nLet us examine the energy equation at the wall ($y=0$). Due to the no-slip ($u=0$) and no-penetration ($v=0$) conditions, the convective terms vanish. The energy equation simplifies to a balance between conduction and dissipation at the wall surface:\n$$\n\\left. k \\frac{\\partial^2 T}{\\partial y^2} \\right|_{y=0} + \\left. \\mu \\left( \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial y} \\right)^2 \\right|_{y=0} = 0\n$$\nRearranging for the curvature of the temperature profile at the wall gives:\n$$\n\\left. \\frac{\\partial^2 T}{\\partial y^2} \\right|_{y=0} = -\\frac{\\mu}{k} \\left( \\left. \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial y} \\right|_{y=0} \\right)^2\n$$\nSince $\\mu > 0$, $k > 0$, and $(\\partial u/\\partial y)^2 \\ge 0$ (and is strictly positive for a boundary layer flow), the temperature profile at the wall must be concave down: $\\left. \\frac{\\partial^2 T}{\\partial y^2} \\right|_{y=0} < 0$.\n\nSo, the temperature profile starts at $T_w$ with a positive slope but is curved downwards. For the temperature to rise from $T_w$ to a maximum $T_{max}$ and then decrease to approach the edge temperature $T_e$, it is necessary that $T_{max} > T_e$. Such a \"temperature overshoot\" is only possible if there is a sufficiently strong internal heat source to overcome the cooling at the wall and the temperature deficit relative to the outer flow. This heat source is viscous dissipation.\n\nTo establish the condition for the existence of this maximum, we perform a scaling analysis to compare the magnitude of the heat generation by dissipation with the heat removal by conduction.\nThe volumetric rate of heat generation by viscous dissipation is:\n$$\n\\Phi = \\mu \\left( \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial y} \\right)^2 \\sim \\mu \\frac{U_e^2}{\\delta^2}\n$$\nwhere $\\delta$ is the characteristic thickness of the boundary layer.\nThe volumetric rate of heat removal by transverse conduction is driven by the temperature difference across the layer. The imposed temperature difference that conduction acts against is $(T_e-T_w)$. The scaling for the conduction term is:\n$$\n\\text{Conduction} \\sim k \\frac{\\partial^2 T}{\\partial y^2} \\sim k \\frac{T_e - T_w}{\\delta^2}\n$$\nAn interior temperature maximum becomes possible when the internal heat generation is dynamically comparable to or dominant over the capacity of transverse conduction (scaled by the wall-to-edge temperature difference) to remove this heat. This leads to the condition:\n$$\n\\mu \\frac{U_e^2}{\\delta^2} \\gtrsim k \\frac{T_e - T_w}{\\delta^2}\n$$\nThe boundary layer thickness $\\delta$ cancels, indicating that the condition for the existence of the maximum is a local balance and is independent of the downstream position $x$ (and thus of the Reynolds number $Re_x = \\rho U_e x / \\mu$, which governs $\\delta$). The condition simplifies to:\n$$\n\\frac{\\mu U_e^2}{k (T_e - T_w)} \\gtrsim O(1)\n$$\nThe dimensionless group on the left is the Brinkman number, $Br$. Using the provided definitions, we can also express this in terms of the Prandtl and Eckert numbers:\n$$\nBr = \\frac{\\mu c_p}{k} \\frac{U_e^2}{c_p (T_e - T_w)} = Pr \\cdot Ec \\gtrsim O(1)\n$$\nTherefore, the existence of an interior temperature maximum depends on the Brinkman number (or equivalently, the product of Prandtl and Eckert numbers) being sufficiently large.\n\nThe parameters involved are:\n-   **Brinkman number ($Br$), Prandtl number ($Pr$), and Eckert number ($Ec$)**: These are the primary governing parameters that set the existence criterion.\n-   **Mach number ($M_e$)**: The Eckert number can be expressed in terms of the Mach number as $Ec = (\\gamma-1) M_e^2 / (1 - T_w/T_e)$, where $\\gamma=c_p/c_v$. Thus, high $M_e$ directly leads to large $Ec$ and $Br$. The Mach number is also central to the definition of the recovery temperature $T_r$, which represents the potential for temperature rise due to dissipation.\n-   **Reynolds number ($Re_x$)**: This parameter determines the boundary layer thickness $\\delta \\sim x/\\sqrt{Re_x}$ and consequently affects the magnitude and location of the temperature peak, but it does not appear in the primary existence criterion $Br \\gtrsim 1$. Its role is secondary.\n\n### Evaluation of Options\n\n**A. For a cold wall with $T_w < T_e$, an interior temperature maximum can occur when viscous dissipation is dynamically comparable to or larger than transverse conduction relative to the imposed wall–edge temperature difference, i.e., when $Br = \\mu U_e^2/[k (T_e - T_w)]$ (equivalently $Pr \\, Ec$) is of order $O(1)$ or larger. The most relevant nondimensional parameters are $Pr$, $Ec$ (or $Br$), and $M_e$ through the recovery factor $r$ that sets $T_r$; the Reynolds number $Re_x$ enters only weakly through the boundary-layer thickness and does not set the existence of the maximum.**\n\n-   This statement accurately describes the physical mechanism (balance of dissipation and conduction), correctly identifies the governing parameter ($Br = Pr \\cdot Ec$), provides the correct criterion ($Br \\gtrsim O(1)$), correctly lists the key parameters ($Pr, Ec, M_e$), and correctly identifies the role of $Re_x$ as secondary. The reasoning is fully consistent with our derivation.\n-   **Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. For $T_w < T_e$, a temperature maximum is guaranteed at sufficiently large $Re_x$, independent of $Pr$ and $M_e$, because streamwise convection dominates and suppresses transverse gradients; $Re_x$ is the controlling parameter.**\n\n-   This is incorrect. The derivation shows the existence criterion is based on the Brinkman number, not the Reynolds number. A large $Re_x$ corresponds to a thin boundary layer, which enhances gradients, but does not in itself guarantee a temperature maximum. The claim of independence from $Pr$ and $M_e$ is fundamentally wrong, as these parameters quantify the dissipation effect.\n-   **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. A temperature maximum requires $T_w > T_e$ so that the profile can turn over; the governing nondimensional group is the Biot number $Bi$ of the plate, and compressibility effects are secondary.**\n\n-   This is incorrect. A temperature maximum due to an internal source (dissipation) can and does occur for a cooled wall, $T_w < T_e$. For a heated wall ($T_w > T_e$), the temperature profile would monotonically decrease towards $T_e$ in the absence of other effects. The Biot number relates to solid-body conduction and is irrelevant to the fluid boundary layer's internal structure. Compressibility effects (high $M_e$) are the primary reason for significant viscous dissipation, not a secondary effect.\n-   **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. With $T_w < T_e$, a temperature maximum is possible only at very small $Pr$ (say $Pr \\ll 1$), because strong thermal diffusion is needed to create an interior extremum; the controlling parameters are $Re_x$ and $Pr$, and viscous dissipation and $M_e$ do not enter except via minor property variations.**\n\n-   This is incorrect. The reasoning is physically flawed. A small $Pr$ implies high thermal diffusivity ($k/(\\rho c_p)$), which would act to smooth out and eliminate temperature peaks, not create them. Furthermore, the statement that viscous dissipation and $M_e$ are not important is a direct contradiction of the fundamental physics; they are the cause of the phenomenon. The controlling parameters are not $Re_x$ and $Pr$ in the manner described.\n-   **Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2472735"}, {"introduction": "The physics of hypersonic flight around a blunt body involves a complex interplay between the shock layer and the boundary layer.

The assumptions, such as that of a calorically perfect gas and weak viscous-inviscid interaction, are standard simplifications for isolating the core phenomena of interest. The apparent contradiction of assuming an adiabatic wall while asking about heat flux $q_w$ is interpreted as a query about the change in heat transfer potential, which is governed by the same physical principles that would determine $q_w$ on a non-adiabatic wall.\n\nThe solution requires two steps: first, a quantitative comparison of the entropy-layer swallowing location, $x_{\\text{sw}}$, and the laminar-turbulent transition location, $x_t$; second, a qualitative analysis of the effect of entropy-layer swallowing on the laminar wall heat flux, $q_w$.\n\n**1. Calculation of Swallowing and Transition Locations**\n\nFirst, we determine the location of entropy-layer swallowing, $x_{\\text{sw}}$. The problem provides the empirical relation:\n$$x_{\\text{sw}} \\approx C_s R_n$$\nWith the given values $C_s \\approx 3.2$ and nose radius $R_n = 0.05\\,\\text{m}$:\n$$x_{\\text{sw}} \\approx 3.2 \\times 0.05\\,\\text{m} = 0.16\\,\\text{m}$$\n\nNext, we determine the location of transition, $x_t$. Transition is stated to occur when the local Reynolds number, $Re_{x,t}$, reaches approximately $7.0\\times 10^6$. The local Reynolds number is defined as $Re_x = Re'\\,x$, where $Re'$ is the unit Reynolds number. Therefore, the transition location is $x_t = Re_{x,t} / Re'$. We must first calculate $Re'$.\n\nThe unit Reynolds number is given by $Re' = \\rho_\\infty U_\\infty / \\mu_\\infty$. We need the freestream velocity, $U_\\infty$.\nThe freestream speed of sound, $a_\\infty$, is:\n$$a_\\infty = \\sqrt{\\gamma R T_\\infty}$$\nUsing the provided values $\\gamma = 1.4$, $R = 287\\,\\text{J}\\,\\text{kg}^{-1}\\,\\text{K}^{-1}$, and $T_\\infty = 226.5\\,\\text{K}$:\n$$a_\\infty = \\sqrt{1.4 \\times 287 \\times 226.5} = \\sqrt{91008.3} \\approx 301.68\\,\\text{m}\\,\\text{s}^{-1}$$\n\nThe freestream velocity, $U_\\infty$, is:\n$$U_\\infty = M_\\infty a_\\infty$$\nWith $M_\\infty = 10$:\n$$U_\\infty = 10 \\times 301.68\\,\\text{m}\\,\\text{s}^{-1} = 3016.8\\,\\text{m}\\,\\text{s}^{-1}$$\n\nNow, we can calculate the unit Reynolds number, $Re'$:\n$$Re' = \\frac{\\rho_\\infty U_\\infty}{\\mu_\\infty}$$\nUsing $\\rho_\\infty = 0.0184\\,\\text{kg}\\,\\text{m}^{-3}$, $U_\\infty = 3016.8\\,\\text{m}\\,\\text{s}^{-1}$, and $\\mu_\\infty = 1.46\\times 10^{-5}\\,\\text{Pa}\\,\\text{s}$:\n$$Re' = \\frac{0.0184 \\times 3016.8}{1.46\\times 10^{-5}} \\approx 3.802 \\times 10^6\\,\\text{m}^{-1}$$\n\nFinally, we find the transition location, $x_t$:\n$$x_t = \\frac{Re_{x,t}}{Re'} = \\frac{7.0\\times 10^6}{3.802 \\times 10^6\\,\\text{m}^{-1}} \\approx 1.84\\,\\text{m}$$\n\nComparing the two locations:\n$$x_{\\text{sw}} \\approx 0.16\\,\\text{m}$$\n$$x_t \\approx 1.84\\,\\text{m}$$\nIt is clear that $x_{\\text{sw}} \\ll x_t$. Entropy-layer swallowing occurs significantly upstream of the predicted location for laminar-turbulent transition.\n\n**2. Physical Effect of Entropy-Layer Swallowing on Wall Heat Flux**\n\nIn hypersonic flow over a blunt body, a strong curved bow shock generates a rotational, non-uniform inviscid flowfield. Streamlines passing through the near-normal portion of the shock experience a large increase in entropy, resulting in a high-temperature, low-density, low-velocity layer of fluid adjacent to the body surface, known as the entropy layer. Streamlines further from the axis pass through weaker, oblique portions of the shock and retain lower entropy, lower temperature, and higher velocity.\n\nThe viscous boundary layer begins at the stagnation point and grows in thickness, $\\delta(x)$, along the surface. Initially, $\\delta(x)$ is smaller than the thickness of the entropy layer, so the boundary layer's edge conditions (denoted by subscript $e$) are those of the hot, slow-moving entropy layer.\n\nEntropy-layer swallowing occurs at the location $x_{\\text{sw}}$ where the boundary layer has grown thick enough to ingest the entire entropy layer. For $x > x_{\\text{sw}}$, the edge of the boundary layer is now exposed to the outer, lower-entropy inviscid flow. This causes an abrupt change in the boundary layer edge conditions:\n- The edge velocity, $U_e$, increases significantly.\n- The edge temperature, $T_e$, decreases.\n- The edge density, $\\rho_e$, increases (as a consequence of lower $T_e$ and higher pressure recovery).\n\nThe wall heat flux, $q_w$, is given by Fourier's law, $q_w = -k_w\\left.\\dfrac{\\partial T}{\\partial y}\\right|_w$. The temperature gradient at the wall is intimately linked to the properties of the entire boundary layer, particularly the edge conditions. According to the Reynolds analogy for compressible flow, the Stanton number ($St$) is related to the skin friction coefficient ($C_f$), which is a measure of the wall shear stress, $\\tau_w$. Specifically, $q_w$ is proportional to $\\tau_w$.\n\nThe wall shear stress is $\\tau_w = \\mu_w\\left.\\dfrac{\\partial u}{\\partial y}\\right|_w$. The velocity gradient at the wall is steepened when the edge velocity $U_e$ increases, as the velocity profile must accommodate a larger velocity change across the same or a thinner boundary layer. The swallowing of the low-momentum entropy layer and subsequent ingestion of the high-momentum outer flow leads to a significant increase in $U_e$. This forces a significant increase in the wall velocity gradient, $\\left.\\dfrac{\\partial u}{\\partial y}\\right|_w$, and consequently a sharp rise in the wall shear stress, $\\tau_w$.\n\nBecause heat transfer and skin friction are directly coupled phenomena, the steepening of the velocity profile is accompanied by a steepening of the temperature profile. The increased wall gradients in both velocity and temperature result in a local increase, or \"overshoot,\" in both the skin friction and the wall heat flux immediately downstream of the swallowing location $x_{\\text{sw}}$.\n\nTherefore, entropy-layer swallowing causes a local increase in the laminar heat flux.\n\n**Evaluation of Options**\n\n- **A.

It is scientifically sound, formalizable, complete, and well-posed.\n\n**Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is deemed **valid**. The solution will now be derived.\n\n**Solution Derivation**\n\nThe objective is to compute the wall heat flux, $q_{w}$, defined by Fourier's law as:\n$$\nq_{w} = -k_{w}\\left.\\frac{dT}{dy}\\right|_{w}\n$$\nThis requires the determination of the temperature gradient at the wall, $\\left.\\frac{dT}{dy}\\right|_{w}$. This gradient is found by differentiating the temperature profile $T(y)$. The temperature profile is obtained from the specified velocity profile using the Walz temperature-velocity relation.\n\nThe Walz relation connects the static temperature $T$ to the velocity $u$ within the boundary layer. For a perfect gas with constant specific heat and a Prandtl number close to unity, this relation is given by a quadratic polynomial in velocity:\n$$\n\\frac{T(u)}{T_{e}} = \\frac{T_{w}}{T_{e}} + \\left(\\frac{T_{aw} - T_{w}}{T_{e}}\\right)\\frac{u}{U_{e}} - \\left(\\frac{T_{aw} - T_{e}}{T_{e}}\\right)\\left(\\frac{u}{U_{e}}\\right)^{2}\n$$\nHere, $T_{aw}$ is the adiabatic wall temperature, which is the temperature the wall would attain if it were perfectly insulated ($q_w=0$). It is defined in terms of the recovery factor, $r$:\n$$\nT_{aw} = T_{e}\\left(1 + r\\frac{\\gamma - 1}{2}M_{e}^{2}\\right)\n$$\nThe problem specifies the recovery factor for a laminar boundary layer, $r = \\Pr^{1/2}$.\n\nTo find the temperature gradient at the wall, $\\left.\\frac{dT}{dy}\\right|_{w}$, we apply the chain rule:\n$$\n\\left.\\frac{dT}{dy}\\right|_{w} = \\left.\\frac{dT}{du}\\right|_{u=0} \\cdot \\left.\\frac{du}{dy}\\right|_{y=0}\n$$\nFirst, we find the velocity gradient at the wall. The given velocity profile is:\n$$\nu(y) = U_{e}\\left[2\\left(\\frac{y}{\\delta}\\right) - \\left(\\frac{y}{\\delta}\\right)^{2}\\right]\n$$\nDifferentiating with respect to $y$:\n$$\n\\frac{du}{dy} = U_{e}\\left[\\frac{2}{\\delta} - \\frac{2y}{\\delta^{2}}\\right]\n$$\nAt the wall ($y=0$), the gradient is:\n$$\n\\left.\\frac{du}{dy}\\right|_{w} = \\frac{2U_{e}}{\\delta}\n$$\nNext, we find the derivative of temperature with respect to velocity, $\\frac{dT}{du}$. From the Walz relation written in terms of $T(u)$:\n$$\nT(u) = T_{w} + \\frac{T_{aw} - T_{w}}{U_{e}}u - \\frac{T_{aw} - T_{e}}{U_{e}^{2}}u^{2}\n$$\nDifferentiating with respect to $u$:\n$$\n\\frac{dT}{du} = \\frac{T_{aw} - T_{w}}{U_{e}} - \\frac{2(T_{aw} - T_{e})}{U_{e}^{2}}u\n$$\nAt the wall, $u=0$, so:\n$$\n\\left.\\frac{dT}{du}\\right|_{u=0} = \\frac{T_{aw} - T_{w}}{U_{e}}\n$$\nCombining these results, the temperature gradient at the wall is:\n$$\n\\left.\\frac{dT}{dy}\\right|_{w} = \\left(\\frac{T_{aw} - T_{w}}{U_{e}}\\right) \\left(\\frac{2U_{e}}{\\delta}\\right) = \\frac{2(T_{aw} - T_{w})}{\\delta}\n$$\nNow we compute the numerical value of $T_{aw}$.\nGiven $\\gamma=1.4$, $M_{e}=5.0$, $T_{e}=220\\,\\mathrm{K}$, and $\\Pr=0.72$:\n$$\nr = \\Pr^{1/2} = (0.72)^{1/2}\n$$\n$$\nT_{aw} = 220 \\left(1 + (0.72)^{1/2} \\frac{1.4 - 1}{2} (5.0)^{2}\\right) = 220 \\left(1 + (0.72)^{1/2} \\cdot (0.2) \\cdot 25\\right) = 220(1 + 5\\sqrt{0.72})\\,\\mathrm{K}\n$$\nNumerically, $T_{aw} \\approx 220(1 + 5 \\times 0.8485281) = 220(5.2426407) \\approx 1153.38095\\,\\mathrm{K}$.\n\nWith $T_{w} = 350\\,\\mathrm{K}$ and $\\delta = 0.5 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{m}$, the wall temperature gradient is:\n$$\n\\left.\\frac{dT}{dy}\\right|_{w} = \\frac{2(1153.38095 - 350)}{0.5 \\times 10^{-3}} = \\frac{2(803.38095)}{0.5 \\times 10^{-3}} \\approx 3.2135 \\times 10^{6}\\,\\mathrm{K}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-1}\n$$\nFinally, we compute the wall heat flux $q_{w}$ using the given value of $k_{w} = 0.035\\,\\mathrm{W}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-1}\\,\\mathrm{K}^{-1}$:\n$$\nq_{w} = -k_{w}\\left.\\frac{dT}{dy}\\right|_{w} = -0.035 \\times \\left(\\frac{2(1153.38095 - 350)}{0.5 \\times 10^{-3}}\\right)\n$$\n$$\nq_{w} = -0.035 \\times (3.2135238 \\times 10^{6}) \\approx -112473.3\\,\\mathrm{W}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-2}\n$$\nThe problem asks for the answer in kilowatts per square meter ($\\mathrm{kW}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-2}$), rounded to four significant figures.\n$$\nq_{w} = -112.4733\\,\\mathrm{kW}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-2}\n$$\nRounding to four significant figures gives:\n$$\nq_{w} = -112.5\\,\\mathrm{kW}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-2}\n$$\nThe negative sign indicates that the heat flux is directed from the fluid to the wall, which is physically consistent since the wall temperature ($T_{w} = 350\\,\\mathrm{K}$) is substantially lower than the adiabatic wall temperature ($T_{aw} \\approx 1153\\,\\mathrm{K}$).", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{-112.5}\n$$", "id": "2472794"}]}
