We derive this by considering the force balance on an infinitesimal fluid element located at the interface.\n\nLet us consider a rectangular fluid control volume of length $\\Delta x$, unit width in the $z$-direction, and infinitesimal thickness $\\delta y$ just below the interface, i.e., occupying the region from $y = h - \\delta y$ to $y = h$. We analyze the forces acting on this control volume in the $x$-direction in the limit as $\\delta y \\to 0$.\n\n1.  **Force from the Interface (Top Surface at $y=h$)**: A gradient in surface tension $\\sigma$ creates a tangential force. This force, known as the Marangoni stress, is exerted by the interface on the adjacent fluid. It pulls the fluid toward the region of higher surface tension. The force per unit area is equal to the surface gradient of the surface tension, $\\nabla_s \\sigma$. For the given $2\\mathrm{D}$ case, this force per unit area is $\\frac{\\partial \\sigma}{\\partial x} \\hat{\\boldsymbol{x}}$. The total force on the top surface of the control volume is $F_{\\sigma} = \\frac{\\partial \\sigma}{\\partial x} \\Delta x$.\n\n2.  **Viscous Force from the Fluid Below (Bottom Surface at $y=h-\\delta y$)**: The fluid below the control volume exerts a shear stress on its bottom face. The normal to this face, from the perspective of the control volume, is $-\\hat{\\boldsymbol{y}}$. The stress vector on this surface is $\\boldsymbol{\\mathrm{T}} \\cdot (-\\hat{\\boldsymbol{y}})$, where $\\boldsymbol{\\mathrm{T}}$ is the Cauchy stress tensor. The $x$-component of this force is $(\\boldsymbol{\\mathrm{T}} \\cdot (-\\hat{\\boldsymbol{y}})) \\cdot \\hat{\\boldsymbol{x}}$.\n    For a Newtonian fluid, the stress tensor is $\\boldsymbol{\\mathrm{T}} = -p\\boldsymbol{\\mathrm{I}} + \\boldsymbol{\\tau}$, where $p$ is pressure and $\\boldsymbol{\\tau}$ is the viscous stress tensor. The $x$-component of the force from the fluid below is $( (-p\\boldsymbol{\\mathrm{I}} + \\boldsymbol{\\tau}) \\cdot (-\\hat{\\boldsymbol{y}}) ) \\cdot \\hat{\\boldsymbol{x}} = (-\\boldsymbol{\\tau} \\cdot \\hat{\\boldsymbol{y}}) \\cdot \\hat{\\boldsymbol{x}} = -\\tau_{yx} = -\\tau_{xy}$.\n    The viscous force is $F_{\\text{visc}} = -\\tau_{xy}|_{y=h-\\delta y} \\Delta x$.\n\nFor a steady flow with no net acceleration of the infinitesimal element, the sum of forces must be zero. As $\\delta y \\to 0$, the forces on the side faces cancel, and inertia and pressure gradient forces over the element's volume become negligible. The balance becomes:\n$$F_{\\sigma} + F_{\\text{visc}} = 0$$\n$$\\frac{\\partial \\sigma}{\\partial x} \\Delta x - \\tau_{xy}|_{y=h} \\Delta x = 0$$\nThis simplifies to the general tangential stress balance at the interface:\n$$\\tau_{xy}|_{y=h} = \\frac{\\partial \\sigma}{\\partial x}$$\nHere, $\\tau_{xy}$ is the shear stress component in the liquid at the interface. For an incompressible Newtonian fluid, the shear stress tensor component is given by:\n$$\\tau_{xy} = \\mu \\left( \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial y} + \\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial x} \\right)$$\nSubstituting this into the balance gives:\n$$\\mu \\left( \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial y} + \\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial x} \\right)\\bigg|_{y=h} = \\frac{\\partial \\sigma}{\\partial x}$$\nThis is the complete tangential stress balance. Now, we apply the slender film approximation, $\\varepsilon = h/L \\ll 1$. From the continuity equation, $\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x} + \\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial y} = 0$, a scaling analysis shows that $\\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial x}$ is of order $\\varepsilon^2$ smaller than $\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial y}$.

We consider an incompressible Newtonian fluid under the Boussinesq approximation. The problem specifies that buoyancy effects are to be neglected in comparison to thermocapillary effects for the purpose of scaling. The coordinate system is defined with the $z$-axis normal to the horizontal layer, pointing upwards from the bottom plate at $z=0$ to the free surface at $z=L$.\n\nThe governing equations are:\nThe momentum equation (Navier-Stokes), neglecting the buoyancy term:\n$$ \\rho \\left( \\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{u}}{\\partial t} + (\\mathbf{u} \\cdot \\nabla) \\mathbf{u} \\right) = - \\nabla p + \\mu \\nabla^2 \\mathbf{u} $$\nThe energy equation:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial t} + (\\mathbf{u} \\cdot \\nabla) T = \\alpha \\nabla^2 T $$\nHere, $\\mathbf{u}$ is the velocity vector, $p$ is the pressure, $T$ is the temperature, $\\rho$ is the constant reference density, $\\mu$ is the dynamic viscosity, and $\\alpha$ is the thermal diffusivity.\n\nThe crucial boundary condition is the tangential stress balance at the free surface, $z=L$.

Let $L$ be the characteristic length scale in all directions, as expected for convection cells where horizontal and vertical scales are comparable. Let $U$ be the characteristic velocity scale of the flow, and $\\Delta T$ be the characteristic temperature difference across the layer.\n\nFrom the tangential stress balance, we balance the viscous stress with the thermocapillary stress:\n$$ \\mu \\frac{U}{L} \\sim \\sigma_{T} \\frac{\\Delta T}{L} $$\nThis balance determines the characteristic velocity scale driven by the surface tension gradients:\n$$ U \\sim \\frac{\\sigma_{T} \\Delta T}{\\mu} $$\nThis velocity represents the magnitude of the fluid motion induced by thermocapillarity.\n\nThe Marangoni number arises from comparing the rate of heat transport by this induced convection to the rate of heat transport by thermal diffusion. This ratio is the Péclet number, $\\mathrm{Pe}$.\nThe advective heat flux scales as $\\rho c_p U \\Delta T$, while the diffusive heat flux scales as $k \\Delta T / L$. The ratio of the corresponding transport rates (advection over diffusion) is:\n$$ \\mathrm{Pe} = \\frac{\\text{advective transport}}{\\text{diffusive transport}} \\sim \\frac{U L}{\\alpha} $$\nwhere $\\alpha = k/(\\rho c_p)$ is the thermal diffusivity.\n\nSubstituting the characteristic velocity $U$ from the stress balance into the expression for the Péclet number gives the dimensionless group that compares thermocapillary forcing to viscous and thermal dissipation.

The onset of thermocapillary convection occurs when the Marangoni number $\\mathrm{Ma}$ exceeds a critical value, $\\mathrm{Ma}_c$. This critical value is determined by linear stability analysis and depends on the boundary conditions, notably the Biot number $\\mathrm{Bi}$ at the free surface.\nFor a layer heated from below with a non-deformable free surface and a rigid, conducting bottom, the seminal work of Pearson (1958) provides the stability criterion.\nThe Biot number $\\mathrm{Bi} = hL/k$ dictates the thermal condition at the surface. A value of $\\mathrm{Bi} = 0$ corresponds to an insulating surface, which is most susceptible to thermocapillary instability, with a critical Marangoni number $\\mathrm{Ma}_c \\approx 79.6$. As $\\mathrm{Bi}$ increases, the surface temperature is increasingly fixed, which stabilizes the system and raises $\\mathrm{Ma}_c$.\nFor $\\mathrm{Bi} = 0.5$, which is of order unity as specified, the surface is neither perfectly insulating nor perfectly conducting. The corresponding critical Marangoni number from linear stability theory is $\\mathrm{Ma}_c \\approx 110$.\nOur calculated Marangoni number is $\\mathrm{Ma} \\approx 21430$. Comparing this to the critical value:\n$$ \\mathrm{Ma} \\approx 21430 \\gg \\mathrm{Ma}_c \\approx 110 $$\nThe Marangoni number of the system is more than two orders of magnitude greater than the critical value for the onset of instability.
