Consider carbon dioxide at pressure $p = 8.00~\\mathrm{MPa}$ and temperature $T = 315.0~\\mathrm{K}$ (near the pseudo-critical temperature at this pressure). The reference properties from a high-accuracy Equation of State (EOS) are: density $\\rho_{\\mathrm{EOS}} = 560~\\mathrm{kg} \\cdot \\mathrm{m}^{-3}$ and isobaric heat capacity (per unit mass) $c_{p,\\mathrm{EOS}} = 7.00~\\mathrm{kJ} \\cdot \\mathrm{kg}^{-1} \\cdot \\mathrm{K}^{-1}$.

It presents a standard task in engineering thermodynamics: a comparison of a simplified model (ideal gas) against high-accuracy reference data (EOS) for a real fluid under non-ideal conditions. The state point specified for carbon dioxide is in the supercritical region near the pseudo-critical line, where large deviations from ideal-gas behavior are expected, making the exercise meaningful. All necessary data are provided, and there are no contradictions. The problem is therefore valid, and a solution will be constructed.\n\nThe task is to compute the fractional deviations for density, $e_{\\rho}$, and isobaric heat capacity, $e_{c_{p}}$, when modeling supercritical carbon dioxide as an ideal gas. The fractional deviation for a property $X$ is defined as:\n$$ e_X = \\frac{X_{\\mathrm{ideal}} - X_{\\mathrm{EOS}}}{X_{\\mathrm{EOS}}} $$\n\nFirst, we compute the density as predicted by the ideal-gas model, $\\rho_{\\mathrm{ideal}}$. The ideal gas law in terms of density is derived from $pV = nR_uT$. Substituting the number of moles $n = m/M$, where $m$ is mass, we have $pV = (m/M)R_uT$. Rearranging for density $\\rho = m/V$ gives:\n$$ \\rho_{\\mathrm{ideal}} = \\frac{pM}{R_uT} $$\nWe must use a consistent set of units.

The negative sign signifies that the ideal-gas model dramatically underpredicts the density. This is expected, as the ideal gas model neglects the finite volume of molecules and the strong intermolecular attractive forces that become dominant at high pressures and densities, such as in the supercritical state near the critical point.\n\nNext, we compute the fractional deviation in isobaric heat capacity, $e_{c_{p}}$. For an ideal gas, the isobaric heat capacity $c_{p}$ is a function of temperature only and is independent of pressure. The problem provides this ideal-gas value directly as $c_{p}^{0}(T) = 0.90~\\mathrm{kJ} \\cdot \\mathrm{kg}^{-1} \\cdot \\mathrm{K}^{-1}$. Therefore, our model prediction is:\n$$ c_{p,\\mathrm{ideal}} = 0.90~\\mathrm{kJ} \\cdot \\mathrm{kg}^{-1} \\cdot \\mathrm{K}^{-1} $$\nThe reference value is given as $c_{p,\\mathrm{EOS}} = 7.00~\\mathrm{kJ} \\cdot \\mathrm{kg}^{-1} \\cdot \\mathrm{K}^{-1}$. We can now compute the deviation:\n$$ e_{c_{p}} = \\frac{c_{p,\\mathrm{ideal}} - c_{p,\\mathrm{EOS}}}{c_{p,\\mathrm{EOS}}} = \\frac{0.90 - 7.00}{7.00} = \\frac{-6.10}{7.00} \\approx -0.871428 $$\nRounding to four significant figures, the deviation is $e_{c_{p}} = -0.8714$. This substantial underprediction is a hallmark of the pseudo-critical region, where the isobaric heat capacity of a real fluid exhibits a sharp peak that the ideal-gas model is fundamentally incapable of capturing. This peak is associated with large changes in density and enthalpy for small changes in temperature, a phenomenon not present in ideal gases.\n\nThe requested deviations are ($e_{\\rho}$, $e_{c_{p}}$).", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} -0.7599 & -0.8714 \\end{pmatrix}}\n$$", "id": "2527554"}, {"introduction": "Once the unique nature of supercritical fluids is established, the next step is to characterize the dominant physical mechanisms in a given flow scenario.

We proceed.\n\nThe system is modeled by two coupled, nonlinear first-order ODEs for the wall temperature, $T_w(t)$, and the bulk fluid temperature, $T_b(t)$. These are derived from the first law of thermodynamics.\n\nFirst, consider the energy balance for the wall, treated as a single thermal mass $m_w$ with specific heat $c_w$. The rate of change of its internal energy, $m_w c_w \\frac{dT_w}{dt}$, equals the net rate of heat addition. This is the applied heat from the external flux, $q''(t)A$, minus the heat convected to the fluid, $h(T_b) A (T_w - T_b)$. Here, $A$ is the heat transfer surface area. The resulting equation is:\n$$\nm_w c_w \\frac{dT_w}{dt} = q''(t)A - h(T_b) A (T_w - T_b)\n$$\nRearranging for the time derivative gives the first governing equation:\n$$\n\\frac{dT_w}{dt} = \\frac{A}{m_w c_w} \\left( q''(t) - h(T_b) (T_w - T_b) \\right)\n$$\n\nSecond, consider the energy balance for the fluid within the control volume $V_b$. For an open system, the rate of change of internal energy within the control volume equals the net rate of energy transfer across its boundaries.\n$$\n\\frac{dU_b}{dt} = \\dot{Q} + \\dot{m}(h_{f,in} - h_{f,out})\n$$\nThe rate of internal energy change, using the specified fluid thermal inertia, is $\\frac{dU_b}{dt} = m_b c_p(T_b) \\frac{dT_b}{dt}$, where $m_b = \\rho V_b$ is the fluid mass in the control volume and $c_p(T_b)$ is the specific heat evaluated at the bulk temperature. The heat transfer rate from the wall to the fluid is $\\dot{Q} = h(T_b) A (T_w - T_b)$. The net rate of enthalpy transport by the flow is $\\dot{m}(h_{f,in} - h_{f,out})$, where $\\dot{m}$ is the mass flow rate. For a well-mixed control volume, the outlet enthalpy is $h_{f,out} = h_f(T_b)$, and the inlet enthalpy is $h_{f,in} = h_f(T_{in})$. This yields:\n$$\nm_b c_p(T_b) \\frac{dT_b}{dt} = h(T_b) A (T_w - T_b) + \\dot{m} (h_f(T_{in}) - h_f(T_b))\n$$\nRearranging gives the second governing equation:\n$$\n\\frac{dT_b}{dt} = \\frac{1}{\\rho V_b c_p(T_b)} \\left( h(T_b) A (T_w - T_b) - \\dot{m} (h_f(T_b) - h_f(T_{in})) \\right)\n$$\n\nThe system of ODEs requires expressions for $c_p(T)$, $h(T_b)$, and the specific enthalpy $h_f(T)$.

The integral of the Gaussian term can be expressed using the error function, $\\mathrm{erf}(x)$. The enthalpy difference required in the ODE is:\n$$\nh_f(T_b) - h_f(T_{in}) = c_0(T_b - T_{in}) + c_1 \\sigma \\sqrt{\\frac{\\pi}{2}} \\left[ \\mathrm{erf}\\left(\\frac{T_b - T_{pc}}{\\sqrt{2}\\sigma}\\right) - \\mathrm{erf}\\left(\\frac{T_{in} - T_{pc}}{\\sqrt{2}\\sigma}\\right) \\right]\n$$\n\nTo solve the problem, we first determine the initial and final steady states.

First, we solve for the bulk temperature $T_{b,ss}$ from the nonlinear equation:\n$$\nh_f(T_{b,ss}) - h_f(T_{in}) = \\frac{A\\,q''}{\\dot{m}}\n$$\nSince $c_p(T) > 0$, $h_f(T)$ is a strictly monotonic function, guaranteeing a unique solution for $T_{b,ss}$. This is found numerically using a root-finding algorithm. Once $T_{b,ss}$ is known, the wall temperature $T_{w,ss}$ is calculated directly:\n$$\nT_{w,ss} = T_{b,ss} + \\frac{q''}{h(T_{b,ss})}\n$$\nThis procedure is applied twice: once with $q'' = q_0''$ to find the initial state $(T_{w}(0), T_{b}(0))$, and once with $q'' = q_1''$ to find the final steady state $(T_{w,ss}, T_{b,ss})$ used for overshoot calculation.\n\nThe transient response is computed by numerically integrating the system of two ODEs from $t=0$ to a final time $t_{f}$. The integration proceeds with the initial condition $(T_w(0), T_b(0))$ and with the heat flux fixed at $q'' = q_1''$. A robust numerical integration scheme, `scipy.integrate.solve_ivp`, is employed, suitable for potentially stiff systems. The integration is terminated either when the system state $(T_w(t), T_b(t))$ is within a specified tolerance $\\varepsilon = 10^{-4}~\\mathrm{K}$ of the final steady state, or when the maximum time $t_{max} = 200~\\mathrm{s}$ is reached. An event-detection mechanism within the integrator handles this termination condition.\n\nFinally, the temperature overshoots are determined from the computed trajectories $T_w(t)$ and $T_b(t)$. They are defined as the maximum deviation above the final steady-state value:\n$$\n\\Delta T_{w,ov} = \\max\\left(0, \\max_{t\\ge 0} T_w(t) - T_{w,ss}\\right)\n$$\n$$\n\\Delta T_{b,ov} = \\max\\left(0, \\max_{t\\ge 0} T_b(t) - T_{b,ss}\\right)\n$$\nThe calculation is performed for each of the four specified test cases, and the results are presented in the required format.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 12.355 & 1.751 \\\\ 0.000 & 0.000 \\\\ 4.580 & 0.517 \\\\ 1.902 & 0.222 \\end{pmatrix}}\n$$", "id": "2527537"}]}
