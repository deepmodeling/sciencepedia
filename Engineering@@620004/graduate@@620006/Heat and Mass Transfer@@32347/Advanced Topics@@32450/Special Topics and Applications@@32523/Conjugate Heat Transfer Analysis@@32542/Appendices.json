We are given to use the principles of energy conservation, Fourier's law, and continuity conditions at the interface.\n\nFirst, we analyze the heat conduction within the solid coating. The coating occupies the region $-t < y < 0$ and has a constant thermal conductivity $k_s$. For steady-state heat transfer with no volumetric heat generation, the temperature field $T_s(x,y)$ within the coating is governed by the Laplace equation:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial^2 T_s}{\\partial x^2} + \\frac{\\partial^2 T_s}{\\partial y^2} = 0\n$$\nThe problem is set in the thin-coating limit, where the thickness $t$ is much smaller than any characteristic length scale in the $x$-direction, which is of the order of the fluid height $H$, i.e., $t \\ll H$. In this limit, an asymptotic analysis shows that heat conduction parallel to the coating surface (in the $x$-direction) is negligible compared to conduction perpendicular to the surface (in the $y$-direction). The term $\\frac{\\partial^2 T_s}{\\partial x^2}$ can be neglected, reducing the governing equation to that of one-dimensional heat conduction:\n$$\n\\frac{d^2 T_s}{dy^2} = 0\n$$\nThe general solution to this ordinary differential equation is a linear temperature profile:\n$$\nT_s(y) = C_1 y + C_2\n$$\nwhere $C_1$ and $C_2$ are constants of integration. These constants are determined by the boundary conditions for the coating.\n\nThe boundary conditions for the temperature field $T_s(y)$ are:\n$1$. At the lower surface of the coating, $y = -t$, it interfaces with a massive substrate maintained at an isothermal temperature $T_b$. Therefore, $T_s(-t) = T_b$.\n$2$. At the upper surface, $y = 0$, the coating is in contact with the fluid. The problem specifies continuity of temperature at this interface. Let the temperature at this interface be denoted by $T_w(x)$, which is equivalent to the fluid temperature at the boundary, $T_f(x, 0^+)$. Thus, the second boundary condition is $T_s(0) = T_w(x) = T_f(x, 0^+)$.\n\nApplying the second boundary condition to the general solution gives:\n$$\nT_s(0) = C_1(0) + C_2 = T_w(x) \\implies C_2 = T_w(x)\n$$\nApplying the first boundary condition gives:\n$$\nT_s(-t) = C_1(-t) + C_2 = T_b\n$$\nSubstituting $C_2 = T_w(x)$ into this equation yields:\n$$\n-C_1 t + T_w(x) = T_b \\implies C_1 = \\frac{T_w(x) - T_b}{t}\n$$\nThus, the temperature distribution within the coating is:\n$$\nT_s(y) = \\frac{T_w(x) - T_b}{t} y + T_w(x)\n$$\nNext, we utilize the condition of continuity of normal heat flux at the fluid–coating interface ($y=0$). The heat flux from the fluid into the wall, denoted $q_w$, is given by Fourier's law applied to the fluid at the interface:\n$$\nq_w = -k_f \\frac{\\partial T_f}{\\partial y} \\bigg|_{y=0^+}\n$$\nwhere $k_f$ is the thermal conductivity of the fluid.\nThis heat flux must be equal to the heat flux conducted from the interface at $y=0$ downwards through the coating.

The heat flux leaving the interface at $y=0$ and entering the coating (in the negative $y$-direction) is therefore $-q_{s,y}$. By conservation of energy, $q_w = -q_{s,y}$:\n$$\n-k_f \\frac{\\partial T_f}{\\partial y} \\bigg|_{y=0^+} = k_s \\frac{T_w(x) - T_b}{t}\n$$\nUsing the temperature continuity condition $T_w(x) = T_f(x, 0^+)$, we can write this relationship entirely in terms of the fluid temperature field $T_f$:\n$$\n-k_f \\frac{\\partial T_f}{\\partial y} \\bigg|_{y=0^+} = \\frac{k_s}{t} \\left( T_f(x, 0^+) - T_b \\right)\n$$\nThis is the required mixed boundary condition of the Robin type for the fluid temperature at the boundary $y=0^+$. It effectively replaces the thermal effect of the coating and substrate with a single condition on the fluid domain.\n\nThe problem asks to show that the heat flux from the fluid into the wall is proportional to the difference between the fluid interfacial temperature and the substrate temperature. The derived equation shows precisely this:\n$$\nq_w = \\frac{k_s}{t} \\left( T_f(x, 0^+) - T_b \\right)\n$$\nThis is of the form $q_w = h_{\\text{eff}}(T_w - T_b)$, where $T_w = T_f(x, 0^+)$. The proportionality constant is the effective heat transfer coefficient, $h_{\\text{eff}}$. By comparing the expressions, we identify $h_{\\text{eff}}$:\n$$\nh_{\\text{eff}} = \\frac{k_s}{t}\n$$\nThis expression depends only on the coating's properties ($k_s$ and $t$), as required. It represents the thermal conductance of the plane wall represented by the coating.\n\nThe final mixed boundary condition on the fluid temperature at $y=0^{+}$ is:\n$$\n-k_f \\frac{\\partial T_f}{\\partial y} \\bigg|_{y=0^+} = h_{\\text{eff}} \\left( T_f(x, 0^+) - T_b \\right)\n$$\nAnd the closed-form analytic expression for $h_{\\text{eff}}$ is $\\frac{k_s}{t}$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\frac{k_s}{t}}\n$$", "id": "2471278"}, {"introduction": "Effective thermal management, particularly in modern electronics, hinges on understanding how heat spreads from a small source into a larger substrate or heat sink.

Since $\\mathrm{Fo} \\ge 0$ and $\\mathrm{Bi} \\ge 0$, this condition is always satisfied.\nThe left-hand inequality, $-1 \\le 1 - \\mathrm{Fo}(1+\\mathrm{Bi})$, gives the stability constraint:\n$$\n2 \\le \\mathrm{Fo}(1+\\mathrm{Bi}) \\implies \\mathrm{Fo} \\le \\frac{2}{1+\\mathrm{Bi}}\n$$\nThus, the maximum allowable Fourier number for the explicit scheme is $\\mathrm{Fo}_{\\max,\\mathrm{exp}}(\\mathrm{Bi}) = \\frac{2}{1+\\mathrm{Bi}}$.\n\n**Scheme 2: Monolithic Backward-Euler (Implicit)**\nThe backward-Euler scheme evaluates the right-hand side of the ODE at the future time level $n+1$:\n$$\n\\frac{T_1^{n+1} - T_1^n}{\\Delta t} = -\\frac{\\alpha (1 + \\mathrm{Bi})}{(\\Delta x)^{2}} T_1^{n+1}\n$$\nWe solve for $T_1^{n+1}$:\n$$\nT_1^{n+1} + \\frac{\\alpha \\Delta t}{(\\Delta x)^{2}}(1 + \\mathrm{Bi}) T_1^{n+1} = T_1^n\n$$\n$$\nT_1^{n+1} \\left[ 1 + \\mathrm{Fo}(1+\\mathrm{Bi}) \\right] = T_1^n\n$$\n$$\nT_1^{n+1} = \\frac{1}{1 + \\mathrm{Fo}(1+\\mathrm{Bi})} T_1^n\n$$\nThe amplification factor for the implicit scheme is $g_{\\mathrm{imp}} = \\frac{1}{1 + \\mathrm{Fo}(1+\\mathrm{Bi})}$.\nFor stability, we check if $|g_{\\mathrm{imp}}| \\le 1$. Since $\\mathrm{Fo} \\ge 0$ and $\\mathrm{Bi} \\ge 0$, the denominator $1 + \\mathrm{Fo}(1+\\mathrm{Bi})$ is always greater than or equal to $1$. Consequently, $0 < g_{\\mathrm{imp}} \\le 1$ for all valid physical and numerical parameters. The implicit scheme is therefore unconditionally stable. No further derivations are required for this scheme.\n\n**Scheme 3: Loosely Coupled \"Lagged Robin\"**\nThis scheme is a mix of implicit and explicit treatments. The spatial operator is evaluated at time $n+1$, but the boundary condition is lagged. The discrete update is based on the general form:\n$$\n\\frac{T_1^{n+1} - T_1^n}{\\Delta t} = \\alpha \\frac{T_2^{n+1} - 2T_1^{n+1} + T_0^{n+1}}{(\\Delta x)^2}\n$$\nwith $T_0^{n+1}=0$ and the given lagged relation for the ghost node: $T_2^{n+1} = (1-\\mathrm{Bi})T_1^n$. Substituting these into the update equation:\n$$\n\\frac{T_1^{n+1} - T_1^n}{\\Delta t} = \\frac{\\alpha}{(\\Delta x)^2} \\left[ (1-\\mathrm{Bi})T_1^n - 2T_1^{n+1} \\right]\n$$\nMultiplying by $\\Delta t$ and using the definition of $\\mathrm{Fo}$:\n$$\nT_1^{n+1} - T_1^n = \\mathrm{Fo} \\left[ (1-\\mathrm{Bi})T_1^n - 2T_1^{n+1} \\right]\n$$\nWe now collect terms with $T_1^{n+1}$ on the left side and terms with $T_1^n$ on the right side:\n$$\nT_1^{n+1} + 2 \\mathrm{Fo} \\, T_1^{n+1} = T_1^n + \\mathrm{Fo}(1-\\mathrm{Bi})T_1^n\n$$\n$$\nT_1^{n+1}(1 + 2 \\mathrm{Fo}) = T_1^n(1 + \\mathrm{Fo} - \\mathrm{Fo} \\, \\mathrm{Bi})\n$$\nThe amplification factor is $g_{\\mathrm{loose}} = \\frac{1 + \\mathrm{Fo} - \\mathrm{Fo} \\, \\mathrm{Bi}}{1 + 2 \\mathrm{Fo}}$.\nThe neutral stability curve is defined by the condition $|g_{\\mathrm{loose}}|=1$.\nSince the denominator is always positive for $\\mathrm{Fo} \\ge 0$, this implies $g_{\\mathrm{loose}} = 1$ or $g_{\\mathrm{loose}} = -1$.\nCase $g_{\\mathrm{loose}} = 1$:\n$$\n\\frac{1 + \\mathrm{Fo} - \\mathrm{Fo} \\, \\mathrm{Bi}}{1 + 2 \\mathrm{Fo}} = 1 \\implies 1 + \\mathrm{Fo} - \\mathrm{Fo} \\, \\mathrm{Bi} = 1 + 2 \\mathrm{Fo} \\implies -\\mathrm{Fo} \\, \\mathrm{Bi} = \\mathrm{Fo}\n$$\nFor $\\mathrm{Fo} > 0$, this yields $\\mathrm{Bi} = -1$, which is physically impossible since $\\mathrm{Bi} \\ge 0$.\nCase $g_{\\mathrm{loose}} = -1$:\n$$\n\\frac{1 + \\mathrm{Fo} - \\mathrm{Fo} \\, \\mathrm{Bi}}{1 + 2 \\mathrm{Fo}} = -1 \\implies 1 + \\mathrm{Fo} - \\mathrm{Fo} \\, \\mathrm{Bi} = -(1 + 2 \\mathrm{Fo})\n$$\n$$\n1 + \\mathrm{Fo} - \\mathrm{Fo} \\, \\mathrm{Bi} = -1 - 2 \\mathrm{Fo}\n$$\n$$\n2 + 3 \\mathrm{Fo} = \\mathrm{Fo} \\, \\mathrm{Bi}\n$$\nSolving for $\\mathrm{Bi}$ gives the critical Biot number as a function of the Fourier number:\n$$\n\\mathrm{Bi}_{\\mathrm{crit,loose}}(\\mathrm{Fo}) = \\frac{2 + 3 \\mathrm{Fo}}{\\mathrm{Fo}} = \\frac{2}{\\mathrm{Fo}} + 3\n$$\nThis defines the neutral-stability curve for the loosely coupled scheme. Stability is maintained for $\\mathrm{Bi} \\le \\mathrm{Bi}_{\\mathrm{crit,loose}}$.\n\nThe final answer requires the expressions for $\\mathrm{Fo}_{\\max,\\mathrm{exp}}(\\mathrm{Bi})$ and $\\mathrm{Bi}_{\\mathrm{crit,loose}}(\\mathrm{Fo})$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{2}{1+\\mathrm{Bi}} & \\frac{2}{\\mathrm{Fo}} + 3 \\end{pmatrix}}\n$$", "id": "2471326"}]}
