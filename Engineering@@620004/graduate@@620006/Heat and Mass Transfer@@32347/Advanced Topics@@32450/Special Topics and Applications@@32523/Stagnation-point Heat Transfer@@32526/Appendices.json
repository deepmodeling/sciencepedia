It is a standard, well-posed problem in boundary-layer theory. A solution will be provided.\n\nWe begin with the steady, two-dimensional, incompressible boundary-layer equations.\nThe continuity equation is:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x} + \\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial y} = 0\n$$\nThe streamwise momentum equation is:\n$$\nu \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x} + v \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial y} = -\\frac{1}{\\rho} \\frac{d P_e}{d x} + \\nu \\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial y^2}\n$$\nHere, $u$ and $v$ are the velocity components in the streamwise ($x$) and wall-normal ($y$) directions, respectively. The pressure gradient $\\frac{d P_e}{d x}$ within the boundary layer is imposed by the outer inviscid flow. From the Euler equation for the outer flow, $U_e \\frac{d U_e}{d x} = -\\frac{1}{\\rho} \\frac{d P_e}{d x}$. Given the outer flow velocity $U_e(x) = a x$, we find:\n$$\n-\\frac{1}{\\rho} \\frac{d P_e}{d x} = (a x) \\frac{d}{dx}(a x) = a^2 x\n$$\nSubstituting this into the momentum equation gives the governing equation for the stagnation-point boundary layer:\n$$\nu \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x} + v \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial y} = a^2 x + \\nu \\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial y^2}\n$$\nNext, we perform a scaling analysis to determine the characteristic scales. Let $L$ be the characteristic length scale in the $x$-direction and $\\delta$ be the characteristic thickness of the boundary layer in the $y$-direction. The velocity scales are $u \\sim U$ and $v \\sim V$.\n\nFrom the continuity equation, the scaling balance is $\\frac{U}{L} \\sim \\frac{V}{\\delta}$, which implies $V \\sim U \\frac{\\delta}{L}$. The characteristic streamwise velocity $U$ is determined by the outer flow at $x \\sim L$, so $U \\sim U_e(L) = a L$.\n\nNow we estimate the order of magnitude of each term in the momentum equation:\n- Inertial terms:\n    - $u \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x} \\sim U \\frac{U}{L} = \\frac{U^2}{L} = \\frac{(a L)^2}{L} = a^2 L$\n    - $v \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial y} \\sim V \\frac{U}{\\delta} \\sim \\left( U \\frac{\\delta}{L} \\right) \\frac{U}{\\delta} = \\frac{U^2}{L} = a^2 L$\n- Pressure gradient term:\n    - $a^2 x \\sim a^2 L$\n- Viscous term:\n    - $\\nu \\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial y^2} \\sim \\nu \\frac{U}{\\delta^2} = \\nu \\frac{a L}{\\delta^2}$\n\nThe fundamental premise of a boundary layer is the balance between inertial (and/or pressure) forces and viscous forces. Therefore, we must have:\n$$\na^2 L \\sim \\nu \\frac{a L}{\\delta^2}\n$$\nSolving for the boundary layer thickness $\\delta$, we find:\n$$\na \\sim \\frac{\\nu}{\\delta^2} \\implies \\delta \\sim \\sqrt{\\frac{\\nu}{a}}\n$$\nThis is the inner normal length scale. Note that this scale $\\delta$ is independent of $x$ and $L$. This signifies that the boundary layer has a constant thickness, a key feature of this self-similar flow.\n\nNext, we must justify the selection of the streamwise length scale $L$. The problem states that \"no external streamwise length scale enters the local problem.\" This is a critical constraint. It implies that any characteristic length must be constructed from the intrinsic parameters of the flow, which are the strain rate $a$ (units of $T^{-1}$) and the kinematic viscosity $\\nu$ (units of $L^2 T^{-1}$). The only combination of $a$ and $\\nu$ that yields a quantity with units of length is $\\sqrt{\\nu/a}$. Therefore, the only consistent choice for the characteristic streamwise length scale $L$ is:\n$$\nL \\sim \\sqrt{\\frac{\\nu}{a}}\n$$\nThis means that the characteristic length scale in the streamwise direction is of the same order of magnitude as the boundary layer thickness, $L \\sim \\delta$.\n\nFinally, we estimate the wall shear stress, $\\tau_w$. By definition, $\\tau_w = \\mu \\left. \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial y} \\right|_{y=0}$. The scaling for the velocity gradient at the wall is determined by the characteristic velocity and length scales of the boundary layer:\n$$\n\\left. \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial y} \\right|_{y=0} \\sim \\frac{U}{\\delta}\n$$\nThe characteristic velocity scale $U$ is defined at the characteristic length $x \\sim L$.\n$$\nU \\sim a L \\sim a \\sqrt{\\frac{\\nu}{a}} = \\sqrt{a\\nu}\n$$\nSubstituting the scales for $U$ and $\\delta$ into the expression for $\\tau_w$:\n$$\n\\tau_w \\sim \\mu \\frac{U}{\\delta} \\sim \\mu \\frac{\\sqrt{a\\nu}}{\\sqrt{\\nu/a}} = \\mu \\frac{\\sqrt{a}\\sqrt{\\nu}}{\\sqrt{\\nu}/\\sqrt{a}} = \\mu a\n$$\nThe problem requires the final expression in terms of $\\rho$, $\\nu$, and $a$.

The simplifying assumptions, while representing an idealized physical model, are explicitly stated and permit a direct solution based on fundamental principles of fluid mechanics. We shall proceed with the derivation.\n\nThe problem is divided into two parts. Part (a) requires the derivation of the stagnation strain rate, $a$. Part (b) requires a justification for mapping the thermal problem to a similarity solution. We will address both in order.\n\n**Part (a): Derivation of the Stagnation Strain Rate $a$**\n\nThe derivation is based on the principle of conservation of mass for a steady, incompressible flow. We apply this principle to a cylindrical control volume (CV) as specified in the problem statement, with radius $R$ and height $H$. For a steady, incompressible flow, the integral form of the mass conservation equation states that the net volumetric flow rate across the control surface (CS) is zero:\n$$ \\oint_{CS} \\mathbf{u} \\cdot d\\mathbf{A} = 0 $$\nThis means the total volume of fluid entering the CV per unit time must equal the total volume exiting per unit time.\n\nThe control volume has three surfaces of interest:\n1.  The top circular surface at $z=H$ and $0 \\le r \\le R$.\n2.  The bottom circular surface at $z=0$ and $0 \\le r \\le R$.\n3.  The cylindrical side surface at $r=R$ and $0 \\le z \\le H$.\n\nWe calculate the volumetric flux, $\\dot{V} = \\int \\mathbf{u} \\cdot d\\mathbf{A}$, for each surface. An outward-pointing normal vector $d\\mathbf{A}$ is used by convention.\n\n1.  **Top Surface (Inflow):**\n    The flow enters the CV through the top surface. The problem states a uniform exit speed $U_j$ from the nozzle. The velocity vector is $\\mathbf{u} = -U_j \\hat{\\mathbf{k}}$. The outward normal to the top surface is $d\\mathbf{A} = dA \\, \\hat{\\mathbf{k}}$. The area is $A_{top} = \\pi R^2$. The flux is:\n    $$ \\dot{V}_{top} = \\int_{A_{top}} (-U_j \\hat{\\mathbf{k}}) \\cdot (\\hat{\\mathbf{k}} \\, dA) = -U_j \\int_{A_{top}} dA = -U_j \\pi R^2 $$\n    The negative sign confirms this is an inflow.\n\n2.  **Bottom Surface (Solid Plate):**\n    The bottom surface is the solid, impermeable plate at $z=0$. The no-penetration boundary condition dictates that the vertical component of velocity is zero, $u_z = 0$, on this surface. The flux through the bottom surface is therefore zero:\n    $$ \\dot{V}_{bottom} = 0 $$\n\n3.  **Side Surface (Outflow):**\n    The flow exits the CV radially through the cylindrical side surface. The velocity vector component normal to this surface is the radial velocity, $u_r$. The outward normal is $d\\mathbf{A} = dA \\, \\hat{\\mathbf{r}}$. According to assumption 4, the radial velocity on this surface is approximated as constant, $u_r \\approx u_r^e = aR$. The differential area is $dA = R\\,d\\theta\\,dz$. The flux is:\n    $$ \\dot{V}_{side} = \\int_{A_{side}} u_r \\, dA = \\int_{0}^{H} \\int_{0}^{2\\pi} (aR) (R \\, d\\theta \\, dz) = 2\\pi a R^2 \\int_{0}^{H} dz = 2\\pi a R^2 H $$\n    The positive sign confirms this is an outflow.\n\nApplying the conservation of mass principle:\n$$ \\dot{V}_{top} + \\dot{V}_{bottom} + \\dot{V}_{side} = 0 $$\n$$ -U_j \\pi R^2 + 0 + 2\\pi a R^2 H = 0 $$\nWe can now solve for the stagnation strain rate $a$. The term $\\pi R^2$ cancels, provided $R \\ne 0$, which is physically required for a jet to exist.\n$$ 2aH = U_j $$\n$$ a = \\frac{U_j}{2H} $$\nThis expression relates the near-field strain rate $a$ to the far-field jet parameters $U_j$ and $H$.\n\n**Part (b): Justification of the Thermal Similarity Solution**\n\nWe are asked to justify the mapping of the local thermal field to a Hiemenz-type similarity problem. We begin with the boundary layer equations for steady, axisymmetric, incompressible flow. The energy equation, neglecting viscous dissipation, is:\n$$ u_r \\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial r} + u_z \\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial z} = \\alpha \\frac{\\partial^2 T}{\\partial z^2} $$\nAt the stagnation point ($r=0$), $u_r=0$ and by symmetry $\\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial r}=0$. The equation simplifies along the stagnation line to:\n$$ u_z \\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial z} = \\alpha \\frac{\\partial^2 T}{\\partial z^2} $$\nFor the axisymmetric stagnation point flow, a similarity solution for the velocity field exists. The velocity components are expressed in terms of a single similarity variable $\\eta = z \\sqrt{a/\\nu}$ and a dimensionless stream function $F(\\eta)$:\n$$ u_r = a r F'(\\eta) $$\n$$ u_z = -2\\sqrt{a\\nu} F(\\eta) $$\nwhere the prime denotes differentiation with respect to $\\eta$. We define a dimensionless temperature profile $\\Theta(\\eta)$ as:\n$$ \\Theta(\\eta) = \\frac{T(z) - T_w}{T_e - T_w} $$\nwhere $T_w$ is the constant wall temperature and $T_e$ is the constant external flow temperature. The derivatives of temperature with respect to $z$ are:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial z} = (T_e - T_w) \\frac{d\\Theta}{d\\eta} \\frac{d\\eta}{dz} = (T_e - T_w) \\Theta'(\\eta) \\sqrt{\\frac{a}{\\nu}} $$\n$$ \\frac{\\partial^2 T}{\\partial z^2} = (T_e - T_w) \\frac{d^2\\Theta}{d\\eta^2} \\left(\\frac{d\\eta}{dz}\\right)^2 = (T_e - T_w) \\Theta''(\\eta) \\frac{a}{\\nu} $$\nSubstituting these expressions and the similarity form for $u_z$ into the energy equation:\n$$ \\left( -2\\sqrt{a\\nu} F(\\eta) \\right) \\left( (T_e - T_w) \\Theta'(\\eta) \\sqrt{\\frac{a}{\\nu}} \\right) = \\alpha \\left( (T_e - T_w) \\Theta''(\\eta) \\frac{a}{\\nu} \\right) $$\nCanceling the common terms $(T_e - T_w)$ and $a$:\n$$ -2\\sqrt{\\nu} F(\\eta) \\Theta'(\\eta) \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{\\nu}} = \\frac{\\alpha}{\\nu} \\Theta''(\\eta) $$\n$$ -2 F(\\eta) \\Theta'(\\eta) = \\frac{\\alpha}{\\nu} \\Theta''(\\eta) $$\nRearranging gives the final ordinary differential equation for the temperature profile:\n$$ \\Theta''(\\eta) + 2 \\frac{\\nu}{\\alpha} F(\\eta) \\Theta'(\\eta) = 0 $$\nRecognizing the Prandtl number, $\\mathrm{Pr} = \\nu/\\alpha$, we have:\n$$ \\Theta''(\\eta) + 2 \\, \\mathrm{Pr} \\, F(\\eta) \\Theta'(\\eta) = 0 $$\nThis demonstrates that the temperature profile, when cast in similarity form, is governed by an ordinary differential equation where the flow field $F(\\eta)$ is coupled to the thermal field only through the Prandtl number. This structure is analogous to the planar Hiemenz flow case, where the equation is $\\Theta'' + \\mathrm{Pr} \\, f(\\eta) \\Theta' = 0$, thus justifying the mapping to a Hiemenz-type thermal problem.\n\nFinally, to identify the characteristic thermal length scale, we perform a scaling analysis on the energy equation $u_z \\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial z} \\sim \\alpha \\frac{\\partial^2 T}{\\partial z^2}$. In the region near the wall but outside the viscous sublayer, the vertical velocity is driven by the external flow, where $u_z \\sim a z$. Let $\\delta_T$ be the thermal boundary layer thickness. The scaling of the terms is:\n$$ (a \\delta_T) \\left( \\frac{\\Delta T}{\\delta_T} \\right) \\sim \\alpha \\left( \\frac{\\Delta T}{\\delta_T^2} \\right) $$\n$$ a \\sim \\frac{\\alpha}{\\delta_T^2} $$\nThis yields the scaling for the thermal thickness:\n$$ \\delta_T \\sim \\sqrt{\\frac{\\alpha}{a}} $$\nThis confirms that the characteristic thermal thickness scales as $(\\alpha/a)^{1/2}$, which is distinct from the hydrodynamic boundary layer thickness scale $\\delta_\\nu \\sim (\\nu/a)^{1/2}$. The ratio of these scales depends on the Prandtl number: $\\delta_\\nu/\\delta_T \\sim \\sqrt{\\mathrm{Pr}}$.", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{\\frac{U_{j}}{2H}} $$", "id": "2525088"}, {"introduction": "The utility of a similarity solution lies in its ability to describe a wide range of physical situations through a single, universal mathematical framework.

For Case I (isothermal wall, $T_w=\\text{constant}$), the temperature difference $T_w - T_\\infty$ is constant, implying $g(x)$ is a constant, so $g'(x)=0$ and $\\beta=0$. Therefore, for both cases, we must have $\\beta=0$, which means that the temperature field $T$ is a function of $y$ (and hence $\\eta$) only, and $\\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial x} = 0$.\n\nThe resulting universal similarity ODE for the dimensionless temperature $\\theta(\\eta)$ is:\n$$\n\\frac{\\alpha}{\\nu} \\theta''(\\eta) + f(\\eta) \\theta'(\\eta) = 0\n$$\nWe define the Prandtl number as $Pr = \\frac{\\nu}{\\alpha}$. The ODE becomes:\n$$\n\\theta''(\\eta) + Pr \\, f(\\eta) \\theta'(\\eta) = 0\n$$\nThis is the required thermal similarity equation. Now, we analyze the boundary conditions for each case.\n\n**Case I: Isothermal Wall**\nThe dimensionless temperature is defined as:\n$$\n\\theta_{T}(\\eta) = \\frac{T(\\eta) - T_{\\infty}}{T_{w} - T_{\\infty}}\n$$\nThe boundary conditions on $T$ are $T(0) = T_{w}$ and $T(\\infty) = T_{\\infty}$. We transform these into conditions on $\\theta_{T}(\\eta)$:\n-   At the wall, $y=0$, which corresponds to $\\eta=0$:\n    $$\n    \\theta_{T}(0) = \\frac{T(0) - T_{\\infty}}{T_{w} - T_{\\infty}} = \\frac{T_{w} - T_{\\infty}}{T_{w} - T_{\\infty}} = 1\n    $$\n-   In the far field, $y \\to \\infty$, which corresponds to $\\eta \\to \\infty$:\n    $$\n    \\theta_{T}(\\infty) = \\frac{T(\\infty) - T_{\\infty}}{T_{w} - T_{\\infty}} = \\frac{T_{\\infty} - T_{\\infty}}{T_{w} - T_{\\infty}} = 0\n    $$\nThe required wall boundary condition for $\\theta_{T}$ at $\\eta=0$ is $\\theta_{T}(0) = 1$.\n\n**Case II: Uniform Prescribed Heat Flux**\nThe wall boundary condition is $-k\\, (\\partial T/\\partial y)|_{y=0} = q''_{w}$. We must define a dimensionless temperature $\\theta_{q}(\\eta)$ such that the governing ODE remains $\\theta_{q}'' + Pr \\, f \\theta_{q}' = 0$. The normalization must be based on $q''_{w}$. A scaling group with units of temperature can be constructed from the given parameters: $q''_w, k, a, \\nu$. The group is $\\frac{q''_{w}}{k} \\sqrt{\\frac{\\nu}{a}}$.\nWe define $\\theta_q(\\eta)$ as:\n$$\nT(\\eta) - T_{\\infty} = \\left( \\frac{q''_{w}}{k} \\sqrt{\\frac{\\nu}{a}} \\right) \\theta_{q}(\\eta)\n$$\nNow, we transform the heat flux boundary condition. We first find the temperature gradient $\\partial T/\\partial y$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial y} = \\frac{dT}{d\\eta} \\frac{d\\eta}{dy} = \\left[ \\left( \\frac{q''_{w}}{k} \\sqrt{\\frac{\\nu}{a}} \\right) \\theta_{q}'(\\eta) \\right] \\left( \\sqrt{\\frac{a}{\\nu}} \\right) = \\frac{q''_{w}}{k} \\theta_{q}'(\\eta)\n$$\nNow, we evaluate this expression at the wall ($y=0, \\eta=0$) and substitute it into the boundary condition:\n$$\n-k \\left. \\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial y} \\right|_{y=0} = -k \\left( \\frac{q''_{w}}{k} \\theta_{q}'(0) \\right) = q''_{w}\n$$\nThis simplifies to:\n$$\n-q''_{w} \\theta_{q}'(0) = q''_{w}\n$$\nSince $q''_{w}$ is a prescribed positive constant, it is non-zero, and we can divide by it:\n$$\n-\\theta_{q}'(0) = 1\n$$\nThis is the required boundary condition on the derivative of $\\theta_q$ at $\\eta=0$. The far-field condition $T(\\infty) = T_{\\infty}$ implies $\\theta_{q}(\\infty) = 0$.\n\n**Final Result Collation**\nThe problem asks for the row matrix $[\\theta_{T}(0), -\\theta_{q}'(0)]$.\nFrom Case I, we found $\\theta_{T}(0) = 1$.\nFrom Case II, we found $-\\theta_{q}'(0) = 1$.\nThe resulting matrix is $[1, 1]$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}}\n$$", "id": "2525107"}]}
