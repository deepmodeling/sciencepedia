For a binary mixture, $x_1 + x_2 = 1$. The Soret coefficient, $S_T$, is defined as $S_T = \\frac{D_T}{D}$, with units of inverse temperature.

Linearization and Mole Fraction Difference**\n\nWe now linearize this result under the assumption that $\\lvert S_T \\Delta T \\rvert \\ll 1$. This implies that the composition variation along the channel is small, so we can approximate $x_1(z) \\approx x_{1,0}$, where $x_{1,0}$ is the initial (and average) mole fraction. We start from the differential form:\n$$\n\\frac{d x_1}{d z} = -S_T x_1(1-x_1) \\frac{d T}{d z}\n$$\nAssuming small variations in $x_1$, the term $x_1(1-x_1)$ can be treated as a constant, $x_{1,0}(1-x_{1,0})$.\n$$\n\\frac{d x_1}{d z} \\approx -S_T x_{1,0}(1-x_{1,0}) \\frac{d T}{d z}\n$$\nThe problem specifies a linear temperature profile.

The first term on the right represents the Fickian-type diffusion arising from the relative motion of the species, and the second term on the right accounts for thermodiffusion (the Soret effect).\n\nOur goal is to derive an expression for $N_1$. To do this, we must eliminate $N_2$ from the equation. The total molar flux, $N$, is defined as the sum of the individual species fluxes:\n$$\nN = N_1 + N_2\n$$\nFrom this definition, we have $N_2 = N - N_1$. Substituting this into the Maxwell–Stefan equation:\n$$\n\\nabla x_1 = \\frac{x_1 (N - N_1) - x_2 N_1}{c D_{12}} - k_T x_1 x_2 \\nabla(\\ln T)\n$$\nWe can simplify the numerator of the first term on the right-hand side:\n$$\nx_1(N - N_1) - x_2 N_1 = x_1 N - x_1 N_1 - x_2 N_1 = x_1 N - (x_1 + x_2)N_1\n$$\nSince for a binary mixture, the mole fractions sum to unity ($x_1 + x_2 = 1$), this simplifies to:\n$$\nx_1 N - N_1\n$$\nSubstituting this back, the Maxwell–Stefan equation becomes:\n$$\n\\nabla x_1 = \\frac{x_1 N - N_1}{c D_{12}} - k_T x_1 x_2 \\nabla(\\ln T)\n$$\nNow, we rearrange the equation to solve for $N_1$. First, we isolate the term containing $N_1$:\n$$\n\\frac{N_1 - x_1 N}{c D_{12}} = - \\nabla x_1 - k_T x_1 x_2 \\nabla(\\ln T)\n$$\nMultiplying by $c D_{12}$ gives:\n$$\nN_1 - x_1 N = - c D_{12} \\left[ \\nabla x_1 + k_T x_1 x_2 \\nabla(\\ln T) \\right]\n$$\nFinally, solving for $N_1$ yields the desired expression:\n$$\nN_1 = - c D_{12} \\left[ \\nabla x_1 + x_1 x_2 k_T \\nabla(\\ln T) \\right] + x_1 N\n$$\nIn this expression:\n- $N_1$ is the total molar flux of species $1$.\n- The term $x_1 N$ represents the molar convective flux of species $1$, which is the transport of species $1$ due to the bulk molar flow with velocity $v = N/c$.\n- The term $- c D_{12} \\left[ \\nabla x_1 + x_1 x_2 k_T \\nabla(\\ln T) \\right]$ is the molar diffusion flux of species $1$, denoted $J_1$, relative to the molar-average velocity frame. This diffusive flux is driven by two effects: the ordinary diffusion due to the mole fraction gradient ($\\propto \\nabla x_1$) and the thermodiffusion (Soret effect) due to the temperature gradient ($\\propto \\nabla(\\ln T)$).\n\n**2) Comparison of \"No Net Molar Flux\" and \"No Net Mass Flux\" Constraints**\n\nThe two constraints are defined as follows:\n- No net molar flux: $N = N_1 + N_2 = 0$.\n- No net mass flux: $\\sum_{i=1}^2 M_i N_i = M_1 N_1 + M_2 N_2 = 0$.\n\nTo show these are different, we analyze the second constraint. From $M_1 N_1 + M_2 N_2 = 0$, we can express $N_2$ as $N_2 = -(M_1/M_2) N_1$. The total molar flux $N$ is then:\n$$\nN = N_1 + N_2 = N_1 - \\frac{M_1}{M_2} N_1 = N_1 \\left( 1 - \\frac{M_1}{M_2} \\right)\n$$\nSince the problem states that $M_1 \\neq M_2$, the term $(1 - M_1/M_2)$ is non-zero. Therefore, $N=0$ if and only if $N_1=0$. If $N_1=0$, then $N_2=0$, which is a trivial state of no flux. In any non-trivial diffusive process where $N_1 \\neq 0$, the condition of no net mass flux implies a non-zero net molar flux $N \\neq 0$. Thus, the two constraints are generally different.\n\nNext, we derive an expression for $N$ under the no-net-mass-flux constraint. We have expressions for $N_1$ and $N_2$. The expression for $N_2$ can be found by symmetry or by using $J_2 = -J_1$:\n$N_2 = J_2 + x_2 N = -J_1 + x_2 N = c D_{12} \\left[ \\nabla x_1 + x_1 x_2 k_T \\nabla(\\ln T) \\right] + x_2 N$.\nSubstituting the expressions for $N_1$ and $N_2$ into the constraint $M_1 N_1 + M_2 N_2 = 0$:\n$$\nM_1 \\left( - c D_{12} \\left[ \\nabla x_1 + x_1 x_2 k_T \\nabla(\\ln T) \\right] + x_1 N \\right) + M_2 \\left( c D_{12} \\left[ \\nabla x_1 + x_1 x_2 k_T \\nabla(\\ln T) \\right] + x_2 N \\right) = 0\n$$\nLet us group the terms multiplying $N$ and the terms multiplying the gradients:\n$$\nN (M_1 x_1 + M_2 x_2) + c D_{12} \\left[ \\nabla x_1 + x_1 x_2 k_T \\nabla(\\ln T) \\right] (M_2 - M_1) = 0\n$$\nThe term $M_1 x_1 + M_2 x_2$ is the mixture-averaged molar mass, $\\bar{M}$.\n$$\nN \\bar{M} + c D_{12} (M_2 - M_1) \\left[ \\nabla x_1 + x_1 x_2 k_T \\nabla(\\ln T) \\right] = 0\n$$\nSolving for $N$:\n$$\nN = - \\frac{c D_{12} (M_2 - M_1)}{\\bar{M}} \\left[ \\nabla x_1 + x_1 x_2 k_T \\nabla(\\ln T) \\right]\n$$\nThis can be written as:\n$$\nN = \\frac{c D_{12} (M_1 - M_2)}{x_1 M_1 + x_2 M_2} \\left[ \\nabla x_1 + x_1 x_2 k_T \\nabla(\\ln T) \\right]\n$$\nThis expression shows that, under the no-net-mass-flux condition, a net molar flux $N$ exists whenever there is a composition or temperature gradient, provided $M_1 \\neq M_2$.\n\n**3) Calculation of the Difference in Mole-Fraction Gradient**\n\nWe are given the condition of a closed system for species $1$, which means there is no net molar transport of species $1$ through any cross-section: $N_1 = 0$. We must find the resulting steady mole-fraction gradient $\\nabla x_1$ under two alternative constraints.\nFrom the result of Part 1, setting $N_1=0$ gives:\n$$\n0 = - c D_{12} \\left[ \\nabla x_1 + x_1 x_2 k_T \\nabla(\\ln T) \\right] + x_1 N\n$$\nRearranging for $\\nabla x_1$:\n$$\n\\nabla x_1 = \\frac{x_1 N}{c D_{12}} - x_1 x_2 k_T \\nabla(\\ln T)\n$$\nThis is the general expression for the mole fraction gradient required to maintain $N_1=0$ for a given total molar flux $N$.\n\n**Case A: No net molar flux ($N=0$)**\nWe substitute $N=0$ into the general expression for $\\nabla x_1$:\n$$\n\\left[\\nabla x_1\\right]_{\\text{no net molar flux}} = \\frac{x_1(0)}{c D_{12}} - x_1 x_2 k_T \\nabla(\\ln T)\n$$\n$$\n\\left[\\nabla x_1\\right]_{\\text{A}} = - x_1 x_2 k_T \\nabla(\\ln T)\n$$\nIn this case, the concentration gradient is established solely to balance the thermodiffusive flux. Note that with $N_1=0$ and $N=0$, it follows that $N_2 = N-N_1 = 0$. This corresponds to a system closed to both species.\n\n**Case B: No net mass flux ($\\sum_i M_i N_i = 0$)**\nHere, the steady state is subject to two simultaneous conditions:\n1. No net transport of species 1: $N_1 = 0$.\n2. No net mass flux: $M_1 N_1 + M_2 N_2 = 0$.\n\nSubstituting the first condition into the second gives:\n$$\nM_1(0) + M_2 N_2 = 0 \\implies M_2 N_2 = 0\n$$\nSince the molar mass $M_2$ is non-zero, this requires that $N_2 = 0$.\nTherefore, the total molar flux $N = N_1 + N_2 = 0 + 0 = 0$.\nThe combination of constraints in Case B ($N_1=0$ and $\\sum M_i N_i=0$) forces the total molar flux $N$ to be zero, given that $M_1 \\neq M_2$. This means the physical conditions of Case B are identical to the physical conditions of Case A. Both cases describe a steady state where both species fluxes are zero ($N_1=0, N_2=0$), corresponding to a system that is closed at its boundaries.\n\nSince the constraints on the system are identical in both cases, the resulting mole-fraction gradient must also be the same.\n$$\n\\left[\\nabla x_1\\right]_{\\text{no net mass flux}} = \\left[\\nabla x_1\\right]_{\\text{B}} = \\left[\\nabla x_1\\right]_{\\text{A}} = - x_1 x_2 k_T \\nabla(\\ln T)\n$$\nThe problem asks for the difference $\\Delta(\\nabla x_1)$:\n$$\n\\Delta(\\nabla x_1) \\equiv \\big[\\nabla x_1\\big]_{\\text{no net mass flux}} - \\big[\\nabla x_1\\big]_{\\text{no net molar flux}}\n$$\n$$\n\\Delta(\\nabla x_1) = \\left[\\nabla x_1\\right]_{\\text{B}} - \\left[\\nabla x_1\\right]_{\\text{A}} = (- x_1 x_2 k_T \\nabla(\\ln T)) - (- x_1 x_2 k_T \\nabla(\\ln T)) = 0\n$$\nThe seemingly distinct scenarios presented in Part 3 are, upon rigorous analysis of the given constraints, revealed to be identical. The difference is therefore zero.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0}$$", "id": "2523433"}]}
