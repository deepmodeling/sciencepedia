The formulation (steady-state diffusion in a stagnant film with a first-order surface reaction) is a well-posed boundary value problem. All parameters are provided with consistent units, and the assumptions (dilute species, quiescent medium, isothermal conditions) are clearly stated and physically reasonable for such a model. The problem is unambiguous, self-contained, and scientifically sound.\n\n**Verdict:** The problem is valid. We may proceed with the solution.\n\n**Derivation of the Analytical Expression**\n\nThe analysis begins with the steady-state species conservation equation for reactant $A$. For a system with no homogeneous reactions, the divergence of the molar flux of $A$, $\\vec{N}_A$, is zero.\n$$ \\nabla \\cdot \\vec{N}_A = 0 $$\nFor a dilute species, Stefan flow is negligible, so the total molar flux $\\vec{N}_A$ is governed by Fick's first law of diffusion:\n$$ \\vec{N}_A = -D \\nabla C_A $$\nwhere $C_A$ is the molar concentration of species $A$. Combining these gives the governing differential equation for the concentration field:\n$$ \\nabla \\cdot (-D \\nabla C_A) = 0 $$\nGiven that the diffusion is spherically symmetric and the diffusivity $D$ is constant, the equation simplifies to:\n$$ \\frac{1}{r^2} \\frac{d}{dr} \\left( r^2 \\frac{dC_A}{dr} \\right) = 0 $$\nwhere $r$ is the radial coordinate. This equation is valid within the stagnant film, for $r \\in [R, R+\\delta]$.\n\nIntegrating this equation once yields:\n$$ r^2 \\frac{dC_A}{dr} = K_1 $$\nwhere $K_1$ is an integration constant. The molar flux in the radial direction is $N_{A,r} = -D \\frac{dC_A}{dr}$. The total molar rate of transfer of $A$ across a spherical surface of radius $r$, which we denote as $W_A$, is given by:\n$$ W_A = (4\\pi r^2) N_{A,r} = (4\\pi r^2) \\left(-D \\frac{dC_A}{dr}\\right) = -4\\pi D \\left(r^2 \\frac{dC_A}{dr}\\right) $$\nFrom the first integration, we see that $W_A = -4\\pi D K_1$. Since $K_1$ is a constant, $W_A$ must also be constant throughout the film, as expected from species conservation. The problem defines consumption, so we define the total consumption rate $N_{\\text{tot}}$ as a positive quantity representing the flow of reactant to the sphere. The flux is directed radially inward ($-r$ direction), so $W_A$ is negative. We set $N_{\\text{tot}} = -W_A$.\n$$ N_{\\text{tot}} = 4\\pi D K_1 $$\nWe can now express the concentration gradient in terms of $N_{\\text{tot}}$:\n$$ \\frac{dC_A}{dr} = \\frac{K_1}{r^2} = \\frac{N_{\\text{tot}}}{4\\pi D r^2} $$\nTo find the concentration profile $C_A(r)$, we integrate this equation between the surface of the catalyst, $r=R$, and the outer edge of the film, $r=R+\\delta$.\n$$ \\int_{C_s}^{C_{\\infty}} dC_A = \\frac{N_{\\text{tot}}}{4\\pi D} \\int_{R}^{R+\\delta} \\frac{dr}{r^2} $$\nwhere $C_s = C_A(R)$ and $C_{\\infty} = C_A(R+\\delta)$. Performing the integration gives:\n$$ C_{\\infty} - C_s = \\frac{N_{\\text{tot}}}{4\\pi D} \\left[ -\\frac{1}{r} \\right]_{R}^{R+\\delta} = \\frac{N_{\\text{tot}}}{4\\pi D} \\left( -\\frac{1}{R+\\delta} + \\frac{1}{R} \\right) $$\n$$ C_{\\infty} - C_s = \\frac{N_{\\text{tot}}}{4\\pi D} \\frac{\\delta}{R(R+\\delta)} $$\nThis equation relates the overall concentration driving force, $C_{\\infty}-C_s$, to the total rate of mass transfer, $N_{\\text{tot}}$, through a diffusional resistance.\n\nNext, we apply the boundary condition at the catalyst surface ($r=R$). The rate of diffusion of $A$ to the surface must equal the rate of consumption by the surface reaction. The total consumption rate, $N_{\\text{tot}}$, is therefore equal to the reaction rate per unit area, $j_{A,s}$, multiplied by the total surface area of the sphere, $A_s = 4\\pi R^2$.\n$$ N_{\\text{tot}} = A_s \\, j_{A,s} = (4\\pi R^2) (k_s C_s) $$\nWe now have a system of two algebraic equations with two unknowns, $C_s$ and $N_{\\text{tot}}$. We can solve for $N_{\\text{tot}}$ by eliminating $C_s$. From the reaction rate equation, we express $C_s$ as:\n$$ C_s = \\frac{N_{\\text{tot}}}{4\\pi R^2 k_s} $$\nSubstituting this expression for $C_s$ into the integrated diffusion equation:\n$$ C_{\\infty} - \\frac{N_{\\text{tot}}}{4\\pi R^2 k_s} = \\frac{N_{\\text{tot}}}{4\\pi D} \\frac{\\delta}{R(R+\\delta)} $$\nRearranging to solve for $N_{\\text{tot}}$:\n$$ C_{\\infty} = N_{\\text{tot}} \\left( \\frac{1}{4\\pi R^2 k_s} + \\frac{\\delta}{4\\pi D R(R+\\delta)} \\right) $$\nThe term in the parentheses represents the total resistance to mass transfer, which is the sum of the surface reaction resistance and the film diffusion resistance.\nThe final analytical expression for the total molar consumption rate is:\n$$ N_{\\text{tot}} = \\frac{C_{\\infty}}{\\frac{1}{4\\pi R^2 k_s} + \\frac{\\delta}{4\\pi D R(R+\\delta)}} $$\n\n**Numerical Evaluation**\n\nWe now substitute the given numerical values into the derived expression.

The film model gives the gas-side molar flux of species to the surface as $N_A = k_g \\left(C_b - C_s\\right)$ with $k_g = D/\\delta$. The surface reaction is first-order with $r_s = k_s(T_s)\\,C_s$ and $k_s(T) = k_0 \\exp\\!\\left(-E/(R T)\\right)$, where $R$ is the universal gas constant. At steady state, the surface species balance requires that the rate of arrival equals the rate of consumption, namely $N_A = r_s$.\n\nThe surface energy balance relates the reaction heat to the thermal removal through both sides of the surface, and with $q \\equiv -\\Delta H_r$ positive for exothermic and negative for endothermic reactions, it reads\n$$\nq\\,r_s \\;=\\; h_g\\left(T_s - T_b\\right) \\;+\\; h_s\\left(T_s - T_w\\right).\n$$\n\nUnknowns are the surface temperature $T_s$ and the surface concentration $C_s$. We first eliminate $C_s$ by using the steady species balance:\n$$\nk_g \\left(C_b - C_s\\right) \\;=\\; k_s(T_s)\\,C_s.\n$$\nSolving for $C_s$ yields\n$$\nC_s \\;=\\; \\frac{k_g}{k_g + k_s(T_s)}\\,C_b.\n$$\nHence the surface reaction rate, equal to the molar flux, is\n$$\nr_s \\;=\\; k_s(T_s)\\,C_s \\;=\\; \\frac{k_s(T_s)\\,k_g}{k_g + k_s(T_s)}\\,C_b,\n$$\nwith\n$$\nk_s(T_s) \\;=\\; k_0 \\exp\\!\\left( -\\frac{E}{R T_s} \\right).\n$$\n\nSubstituting this expression for $r_s$ into the energy balance yields a single nonlinear scalar equation for $T_s$:\n$$\nf(T_s) \\;\\equiv\\; q\\,\\frac{k_s(T_s)\\,k_g}{k_g + k_s(T_s)}\\,C_b \\;-\\; h_g\\left(T_s - T_b\\right) \\;-\\; h_s\\left(T_s - T_w\\right) \\;=\\; 0.\n$$\nOnce $T_s$ is determined from $f(T_s)=0$, we compute $k_s(T_s)$, then\n$$\nr_s \\;=\\; \\frac{k_s(T_s)\\,k_g}{k_g + k_s(T_s)}\\,C_b,\n$$\nand identify $N_A = r_s$. This procedure respects the original balances and the Arrhenius law while reducing the coupled problem to a scalar nonlinear root-finding problem.\n\nAlgorithmic design:\n- For each test case, compute $k_g = D/\\delta$.\n- Define $k_s(T) = k_0 \\exp\\!\\left( -E/(R T) \\right)$ and $r_s(T) = \\dfrac{k_s(T)\\,k_g}{k_g + k_s(T)}\\,C_b$.\n- Define the residual\n$$\nf(T) = q\\,r_s(T) - h_g\\left(T - T_b\\right) - h_s\\left(T - T_w\\right).\n$$\n- Solve $f(T)=0$ for $T$ using a robust bracketed root-finding method. Because $k_s(T)$ is monotonic in $T$ and the linear terms are strictly monotone in $T$, $f(T)$ is continuous and typically monotone (increasing when $q>0$, decreasing when $q<0$), so a bracketed method like bisection or Brent's method is appropriate. Construct an initial bracket $[T_{\\min},T_{\\max}]$ around the larger of $T_b$ and $T_w$, expanding as needed until a sign change is detected, while maintaining $T>0$.\n- After obtaining $T_s$, compute $k_s(T_s)$, then $r_s(T_s)$ and set $N_A=r_s(T_s)$.\n- Round $T_s$ in $\\mathrm{K}$ and $N_A$ in $\\mathrm{mol}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-2}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$ to exactly $6$ decimal places.\n- Aggregate results for the four cases as a single list of lists in the specified order and print as a single line.\n\nDiscussion of edge behaviors covered by the test suite:\n- In the nearly isothermal case, $h_g$ and $h_s$ are large so the energy balance forces $T_s$ close to $T_b$ and $T_w$. Then $k_s(T_s)$ is near $k_s(T_b)$ and the reaction is essentially isothermal.\n- In the mass-transfer-limited case with large $k_0$ and small $k_g$, $r_s(T)$ saturates near $k_g\\,C_b$; the energy balance then predicts a bounded temperature rise consistent with the finite heat removal capacity.\n- In the endothermic case $q<0$, the function $f(T)$ decreases with $T$; the root lies at a surface temperature not exceeding a weighted average of $T_b$ and $T_w$ unless the magnitude of $q\\,r_s$ is large enough to depress $T_s$ further, but here the weak reaction ensures a small deviation.\n\nNumerical implementation details:\n- Use the universal gas constant $R = 8.314\\,\\mathrm{J}\\,\\mathrm{mol}^{-1}\\,\\mathrm{K}^{-1}$.\n- Implement $f(T)$ carefully to avoid overflow in the Arrhenius term by restricting $T$ to a physically reasonable range (for example, above $100\\,\\mathrm{K}$) and using a robust bracketing strategy.\n- Employ Brent's method to solve $f(T)=0$ once a bracket with opposite signs is identified.\n- Post-processing computes and rounds the requested outputs.\n\nThe final program encodes this procedure, evaluates the four cases, and prints a single line in the exact required format.", "answer": "```python\n# The complete and runnable Python 3 code goes here.\n# Imports must adhere to the specified execution environment.\nimport numpy as np\nfrom math import exp\nfrom scipy.optimize import brentq\n\nR_UNIVERSAL = 8.314  # J/mol/K\n\ndef solve_case(params):\n    D = params[\"D\"]\n    delta = params[\"delta\"]\n    Cb = params[\"Cb\"]\n    k0 = params[\"k0\"]\n    E = params[\"E\"]\n    Tb = params[\"Tb\"]\n    Tw = params[\"Tw\"]\n    hg = params[\"hg\"]\n    hs = params[\"hs\"]\n    q = params[\"q\"]\n\n    kg = D / delta  # mass transfer coefficient\n\n    def ks(T):\n        # Arrhenius rate constant\n        return k0 * exp(-E / (R_UNIVERSAL * T))\n\n    def rs(T):\n        k_s = ks(T)\n        return (k_s * kg / (kg + k_s)) * Cb\n\n    def f(T):\n        # Energy balance residual\n        return q * rs(T) - hg * (T - Tb) - hs * (T - Tw)\n\n    # Bracket the root robustly\n    # Start bracket near the weighted average temperature without reaction\n    T_weighted = (hg * Tb + hs * Tw) / (hg + hs)\n    T_low = max(100.0, min(Tb, Tw, T_weighted) - 100.0)\n    T_high = max(Tb, Tw, T_weighted) + 300.0\n\n    # Expand the bracket until sign change or limits reached\n    f_low = f(T_low)\n    f_high = f(T_high)\n\n    # Adaptive expansion\n    expand_factor = 1.5\n    delta_T = 100.0\n    max_high = 5000.0  # physical sanity upper limit\n    min_low = 100.0    # physical sanity lower limit\n\n    attempts = 0\n    # Ensure at least one evaluation before loop\n    while f_low * f_high > 0 and attempts < 60:\n        # Expand both sides\n        new_low = max(min_low, T_low - delta_T)\n        new_high = min(max_high, T_high + delta_T)\n        # Break if no further expansion possible\n        if new_low == T_low and new_high == T_high:\n            break\n        T_low, T_high = new_low, new_high\n        f_low, f_high = f(T_low), f(T_high)\n        delta_T *= expand_factor\n        attempts += 1\n\n    # As a final safety, if still no sign change, try shifting around Tb/Tw\n    if f_low * f_high > 0:\n        # Try a broad fixed bracket\n        T_low, T_high = min_low, max_high\n        f_low, f_high = f(T_low), f(T_high)\n\n    # Solve for Ts using Brent's method (requires sign change)\n    if f_low * f_high > 0:\n        # As a last resort, slightly perturb q to reduce stiffness and retry bracketing\n        # This is highly unlikely for the provided test cases.\n        raise RuntimeError(\"Failed to bracket root for Ts;
