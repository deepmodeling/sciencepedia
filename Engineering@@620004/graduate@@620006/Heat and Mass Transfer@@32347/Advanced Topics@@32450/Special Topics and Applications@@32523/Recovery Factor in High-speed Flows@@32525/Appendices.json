The apparent factor is inferred from a two-point fit to non-adiabatic boundary layer data, while the true factor is defined for adiabatic conditions.\n\nFirst, we are asked to construct a \"Walz-like\" temperature-velocity relation, $T(U)$, for a non-adiabatic wall. This relation must satisfy the boundary conditions and reduce to the classical adiabatic form. The boundary conditions are:\n1.  At the wall: $U=0$, $T=T_w$.\n2.  At the boundary layer edge: $U=U_e$, $T=T_e$.\n\nThe classical adiabatic relation for a flat plate flow is a quadratic function of velocity with no linear term, typically expressed as $T(U) = A' + C'U^2$. To ensure our non-adiabatic relation reduces to this form, we assume the simplest possible functional form that can satisfy the boundary conditions, which is also a quadratic in $U$ without a linear term:\n$$ T(U) = A + B \\left(\\frac{U}{U_e}\\right)^2 $$\nApplying the boundary conditions to find the coefficients $A$ and $B$:\n- At the wall ($U=0$): $T(0) = T_w = A$.\n- At the edge ($U=U_e$): $T(U_e) = T_e = T_w + B \\left(\\frac{U_e}{U_e}\\right)^2 = T_w + B$. Thus, $B = T_e - T_w$.\n\nSubstituting these coefficients back, we obtain the temperature-velocity relation for the non-adiabatic case:\n$$ T(U) = T_w + (T_e - T_w) \\left(\\frac{U}{U_e}\\right)^2 $$\nWe must verify that this relation reduces to the classical adiabatic form when $T_w = T_{aw}$. The adiabatic wall temperature, $T_{aw}$, is defined by the recovery factor $r$:\n$$ T_{aw} = T_e \\left[1 + r \\frac{\\gamma - 1}{2} M_e^2\\right] $$\nUsing the relation $c_p = \\frac{\\gamma R}{\\gamma-1}$ and $M_e^2 = \\frac{U_e^2}{\\gamma R T_e}$, we can write $\\frac{\\gamma-1}{2} M_e^2 = \\frac{U_e^2}{2 c_p T_e}$.
