During flight, this plate is exposed to a high-temperature gas stream. To maintain the structural integrity of the plate, a technique called transpiration cooling is employed, where a coolant gas is forced through the porous material from the inside. This process forms a protective, cooler gas layer at the surface.\n\nThe external hot gas flows parallel to the plate with a freestream velocity $U_\\infty$, temperature $T_\\infty$, density $\\rho_\\infty$, and specific heat at constant pressure $c_{p,g}$. The coolant gas is injected uniformly through the plate with a mass flux $\\dot{m}''_w$. The coolant is supplied at a temperature $T_c$ and has a specific heat at constant pressure $c_{p,c}$. The system is designed to maintain the outer surface of the plate at a constant temperature $T_w$.\n\nThe convective heat transfer from the hot gas to the plate is characterized by the Stanton number, $St$. In the absence of transpiration cooling, the Stanton number at a specific location on the plate is $St_0$. With coolant injection, the Stanton number is reduced according to the film theory model: $St = St_0 \\frac{\\ln(1+B_h)}{B_h}$, where $B_h = \\frac{\\dot{m}''_w}{\\rho_\\infty U_\\infty St_0}$ is the blowing parameter.

For a surface with film cooling, the convective heat flux, $q''$, is determined by the difference between the local adiabatic wall temperature, $T_{aw}$, and the actual wall temperature, $T_{w}$, with the heat transfer coefficient, $h$.\n$$\nq'' = h (T_{aw} - T_w)\n$$\nHere, $T_{aw}$ represents the equilibrium temperature the wall would reach in the presence of the coolant film if the wall itself were perfectly insulated (adiabatic).\n\nThe second principle is the definition of the adiabatic film effectiveness, $\\eta$.

Let the area be $A_\\Omega$.\n    $$\n    \\langle \\eta \\rangle = \\frac{1}{A_\\Omega} \\iint_{\\Omega} \\eta(x,z) \\, \\mathrm{d}A\n    $$\n    For constant $T_h$ and $T_c$:\n    $$\n    \\langle \\eta \\rangle = \\frac{1}{A_\\Omega} \\iint_{\\Omega} \\frac{T_h - T_{aw}(x,z)}{T_h - T_c} \\, \\mathrm{d}A = \\frac{T_h - \\frac{1}{A_\\Omega}\\iint_{\\Omega} T_{aw}(x,z)\\,\\mathrm{d}A}{T_h - T_c} = \\frac{T_h - \\langle T_{aw} \\rangle}{T_h - T_c}\n    $$\n    where $\\langle T_{aw} \\rangle$ is the area-averaged adiabatic wall temperature.\n\nBy the properties of integration (the Mean Value Theorem for Integrals), any average value of a non-uniform field will be strictly greater than the minimum value and strictly less than the maximum value. Consequently, both $\\bar{\\eta}(x)$ and $\\langle \\eta \\rangle$ will smooth out local variations and can mask the existence of localized minima in $\\eta(x,z)$, which correspond to hot spots.\n\n**Evaluation of Options**\n\n**A. For uniform $T_h$ and $T_c$, with $0 \\le \\eta(x,z) \\le 1$ defined by $\\eta(x,z)$ as an affine function of $T_{aw}(x,z)$, the area-averaged effectiveness satisfies...**\nThe option presents the definition of $\\eta(x,z)$ as $\\frac{T_{aw}(x,z) - T_h}{T_c - T_h}$, which is equivalent to the standard definition $\\frac{T_h - T_{aw}(x,z)}{T_h - T_c}$. It is indeed an affine function of $T_{aw}$. The derivation for the area-averaged effectiveness is:\n$$\n\\langle \\eta \\rangle = \\frac{1}{A_\\Omega}\\iint_{\\Omega} \\frac{T_{aw}(x,z) - T_h}{T_c - T_h}\\, \\mathrm{d}A = \\frac{\\frac{1}{A_\\Omega}\\iint_{\\Omega} T_{aw}(x,z) \\, \\mathrm{d}A - T_h}{T_c - T_h} = \\frac{\\langle T_{aw} \\rangle - T_h}{T_c - T_h}\n$$\nThe mathematical relationship is correct. The second part of the statement addresses the physical behavior. At a high blowing ratio $M$, coolant jets can detach from the surface (\"lift-off\"), allowing hot gas to penetrate underneath. This creates regions of very low effectiveness between the coolant jets. These localized hot spots will be smoothed out by both lateral and area averaging. Thus, a high average effectiveness, $\\bar{\\eta}(x)$ or $\\langle \\eta \\rangle$, can coexist with dangerously low local effectiveness values. This statement is physically correct and a critical limitation of averaged metrics.\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\n**B. If the coolant-to-mainstream density ratio $\\rho_c/\\rho_h$ is large, the film always remains fully attached and laterally uniform; therefore any averaging cannot conceal hot spots, and a threshold $\\langle \\eta \\rangle \\ge 0.5$ guarantees no local thermal risk.**\nThis statement is fundamentally flawed. First, a large density ratio $DR = \\rho_c/\\rho_h$ does not guarantee jet attachment. Jet lift-off is primarily governed by the momentum flux ratio $I = (\\rho_c u_c^2) / (\\rho_h u_h^2) = DR \\cdot M^2$. For a high enough blowing ratio $M$, lift-off will occur regardless of $DR$. Second, injection from discrete holes inherently produces a three-dimensional flow field with significant spanwise non-uniformity in $\\eta(x,z)$ near the holes. The film is never perfectly \"laterally uniform\". Third, the conclusion that an average value (e.g., $\\langle \\eta \\rangle \\ge 0.5$) can guarantee a minimum local value is a grave mathematical error. An average provides no information about the minimum of a distribution unless the distribution is known to be uniform. As the film is not uniform, an average value cannot guarantee the absence of local hot spots.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**C. Because averaging in $z$ does not preserve extrema, the laterally averaged metric $\\bar{\\eta}(x)$ is physically meaningless for design; it eliminates all safety-relevant information and should never be used.**\nThis statement is an unscientific exaggeration. It is true that averaging does not preserve extrema; this is the very reason it can mask hot spots. However, to declare the metric $\\bar{\\eta}(x)$ \"physically meaningless\" is incorrect. This metric quantifies the average cooling performance along a streamwise line, which is directly related to the reduction in total heat load over a spanwise section. It is a widely used, valuable metric for comparing the overall performance of different cooling designs, especially in early design stages. While it does not provide local safety information, a low value of $\\bar{\\eta}(x)$ is a clear indicator of poor overall performance and thus is relevant to safety. The assertion that it \"should never be used\" is a dogmatic and impractical prescription that ignores its utility when its limitations are understood.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. If $T_h = T_h(x,z)$ varies over $\\Omega$, then...**\nWhen $T_h(x,z)$ is non-uniform, the local effectiveness is defined as $\\eta(x,z) = \\frac{T_h(x,z) - T_{aw}(x,z)}{T_h(x,z) - T_c}$. The area average is the average of this local quantity:\n$$\n\\langle \\eta \\rangle = \\frac{1}{A_\\Omega}\\iint_{\\Omega} \\frac{T_h(x,z) - T_{aw}(x,z)}{T_h(x,z) - T_c}\\, \\mathrm{d}A\n$$\nThe alternative form, the ratio of averages, $\\frac{\\langle T_h \\rangle - \\langle T_{aw} \\rangle}{\\langle T_h \\rangle - T_c}$, is generally not equal to $\\langle \\eta \\rangle$ because the average of a ratio is not the ratio of the averages. The statement correctly identifies this mathematical inequality. Furthermore, it correctly identifies a critical physical issue: a correlation between a region of high external temperature $T_h(x,z)$ and low local cooling performance $\\eta(x,z)$ can create an extreme hot spot ($T_{aw}$ very high). This local danger can be completely hidden by the domain-averaged $\\langle \\eta \\rangle$, which might remain high due to better performance in other regions. This is a crucial consideration in real applications where freestream temperature is non-uniform.\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\n**E. In the ideal limit of spanwise-uniform injection that yields $\\eta(x,z)$ independent of $z$ for each $x$, the lateral average $\\bar{\\eta}(x)$ equals the pointwise value and cannot conceal hot spots, since no spanwise variations exist to hide in the averaging process.**\nThis option describes an idealized two-dimensional scenario, such as injection from a continuous slot. If $\\eta(x,z)$ is independent of $z$, we can write it as $\\eta(x)$. The definition of the lateral average becomes:\n$$\n\\bar{\\eta}(x) = \\frac{1}{W} \\int_{0}^{W} \\eta(x) \\, \\mathrm{d}z = \\frac{\\eta(x)}{W} \\int_{0}^{W} \\, \\mathrm{d}z = \\frac{\\eta(x)}{W} \\cdot W = \\eta(x)\n$$\nIn this case, the average value is identical to the pointwise value. The process of lateral averaging does not alter the function, and therefore it cannot conceal any information about spanwise variations, as none exist by premise. Any hot regions would be \"hot streaks\" in the $x$-direction, which would be fully represented by the function $\\bar{\\eta}(x)$. The statement is logically and mathematically sound.\nVerdict: **Correct**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{ADE}$$", "id": "2534641"}]}
