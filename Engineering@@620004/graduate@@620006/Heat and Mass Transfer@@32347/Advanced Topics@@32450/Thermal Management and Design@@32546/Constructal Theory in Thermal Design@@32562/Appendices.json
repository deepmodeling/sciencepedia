By calculating the maximum permissible global thermal resistance, $R_{\\text{global,max}}$, you will quantify the total \"performance budget\" available for the entire heat flow path, setting a clear, non-negotiable target that any subsequent constructal optimization must achieve.", "problem": "A compact electronic module rejects a steady heat rate of $Q=200\\,\\text{W}$ to quiescent ambient air at $T_{\\infty}=25^{\\circ}\\text{C}$. The module is mounted on a heat sink base whose allowable maximum temperature is $T_{b}=75^{\\circ}\\text{C}$. Treat the entire flow of heat from the base to the ambient as a single global path comprising all internal conduction, spreading, fin conduction, and external convection processes acting in series, and assume linear (temperature-difference proportional) behavior over the operating range.\n\nStarting from the steady-state energy balance and the linear relationship between temperature difference and heat rate for a generalized series path, derive an expression for the highest allowable aggregate (global) thermal resistance $R_{\\text{global,max}}$ that ensures the base-temperature constraint is not violated. Then compute its numerical value for the given data. Round your answer to three significant figures and express the thermal resistance in $\\text{K}/\\text{W}$.\n\nFinally, explain concisely how the value of $R_{\\text{global,max}}$ constrains architectural choices in a constructal design sense: specifically, how it governs the allocation of geometric degrees of freedom among conductive spreading layers and convective surface generation so that the global resistance is minimized subject to fixed volume and footprint constraints. Your explanation should be qualitative; the only numerical quantity you must report is $R_{\\text{global,max}}$.", "solution": "The problem statement is scientifically sound and well-posed. We shall proceed with the derivation and calculation.\n\nThe fundamental principle governing this problem is the steady-state energy balance. The heat generated by the module, designated as $Q$, must be equal to the rate at which heat is dissipated to the surrounding ambient air. The problem specifies that this heat transfer process can be modeled using a linear relationship, which is the definition of thermal resistance, analogous to Ohm's Law in electrical circuits.\n\nThe relationship between heat flow rate $Q$, temperature difference $\\Delta T$, and thermal resistance $R$ is given by:\n$$Q = \\frac{\\Delta T}{R}$$\nIn this problem, the heat flows from the heat sink base at temperature $T_b$ to the ambient air at temperature $T_{\\infty}$. The entire complex path involving conduction, spreading, and convection is treated as a single, aggregate thermal resistance, $R_{\\text{global}}$. Therefore, the governing equation is:\n$$Q = \\frac{T_b - T_{\\infty}}{R_{\\text{global}}}$$\nFrom this equation, we can express the global thermal resistance as:\n$$R_{\\text{global}} = \\frac{T_b - T_{\\infty}}{Q}$$\nA critical constraint is imposed on the system: the base temperature $T_b$ must not exceed a maximum allowable temperature, which we will denote as $T_{b, \\text{max}}$. This is expressed as the inequality $T_b \\leq T_{b, \\text{max}}$.\n\nFor a fixed heat dissipation rate $Q$ and ambient temperature $T_{\\infty}$, the base temperature $T_b$ is directly proportional to the global resistance $R_{\\text{global}}$. To ensure the temperature constraint is never violated, the global resistance must not exceed a certain maximum value. This highest allowable resistance, $R_{\\text{global,max}}$, corresponds to the limiting case where the base temperature reaches its maximum permitted value, i.e., $T_b = T_{b, \\text{max}}$. If the actual resistance of the system were to be greater than $R_{\\text{global,max}}$, the base would overheat.\n\nThus, we substitute $T_{b, \\text{max}}$ for $T_b$ in the resistance equation to derive the expression for the highest allowable aggregate thermal resistance:\n$$R_{\\text{global,max}} = \\frac{T_{b, \\text{max}} - T_{\\infty}}{Q}$$\nThis is the required analytical expression.\n\nWe now compute the numerical value of $R_{\\text{global,max}}$ using the given data:\n- Heat rate: $Q = 200\\,\\text{W}$\n- Maximum base temperature: $T_{b, \\text{max}} = 75^{\\circ}\\text{C}$\n- Ambient temperature: $T_{\\infty} = 25^{\\circ}\\text{C}$\n\nThe temperature difference $\\Delta T_{\\text{max}} = T_{b, \\text{max}} - T_{\\infty}$ must be calculated. Note that a temperature difference has the same numerical value in units of Kelvin ($\\text{K}$) as in degrees Celsius ($^{\\circ}\\text{C}$).\n$$\\Delta T_{\\text{max}} = 75^{\\circ}\\text{C} - 25^{\\circ}\\text{C} = 50^{\\circ}\\text{C} = 50\\,\\text{K}$$\nSubstituting the numerical values into our derived expression:\n$$R_{\\text{global,max}} = \\frac{50\\,\\text{K}}{200\\,\\text{W}} = 0.25\\,\\text{K/W}$$\nThe problem requires rounding to three significant figures, which yields $0.250\\,\\text{K/W}$.\n\nFinally, we address the role of $R_{\\text{global,max}}$ in the context of constructal design. The value of $R_{\\text{global,max}}$ represents the total thermal \"budget.\" It is the upper limit for the thermal resistance of the entire cooling assembly that will satisfy the system-level requirement of maintaining the base temperature at or below $T_{b, \\text{max}}$. The actual global resistance of the final design, $R_{\\text{global}}$, must satisfy the condition $R_{\\text{global}} \\leq R_{\\text{global,max}}$.\n\nThe goal of thermal design, according to constructal theory, is to discover the optimal geometry (the \"construct\") of heat flow pathways that minimizes the global resistance $R_{\\text{global}}$ subject to physical constraints (e.g., fixed total volume, footprint, material). The global resistance is the sum of a series of component resistances: $R_{\\text{global}} = R_{\\text{spreading}} + R_{\\text{fins}} + R_{\\text{convection}}$. The designer's task is to allocate geometric degrees of freedom—such as the thickness of the heat spreader, and the number, spacing, and dimensions of fins—to strategically balance and minimize the sum of these resistances.\n\nFor example, devoting more material to the heat sink base reduces the spreading resistance but leaves less material available for fins, which may increase the convective resistance. Constructal design provides a formal\nmethodology to resolve such trade-offs by sequentially optimizing the system's morphology at all scales. It aims to generate a structure that provides maximal access for the heat current to flow. The calculated value $R_{\\text{global,max}}$ serves as the ultimate performance benchmark for this optimization process. It dictates how effective the distribution of conductive material and convective surfaces must be. If an optimized architecture fails to meet this target (i.e., its calculated $R_{\\text{global}} > R_{\\text{global,max}}$), the design constraints must be relaxed (e.g., larger volume allowed) or superior materials must be employed. In this manner, $R_{\\text{global,max}}$ acts as the quantitative link between the top-level thermal specification and the detailed architectural choices that shape the cooling hardware.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.250}$$", "id": "2471668"}, {"introduction": "The essence of constructal theory lies in viewing systems as networks designed to facilitate flow.
