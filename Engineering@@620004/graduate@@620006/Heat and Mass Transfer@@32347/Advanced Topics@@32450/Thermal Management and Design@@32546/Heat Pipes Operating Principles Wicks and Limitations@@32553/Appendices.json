The problem is scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and contains all necessary information for a complete solution. Therefore, it is deemed valid.\n\nThe analysis begins with the volume-averaged linear momentum balance for steady, single-phase, incompressible flow in a porous medium. For flow in one dimension, let us say the $x$-direction, this balance simplifies to an equation for the pressure gradient, $-\\frac{dp}{dx}$. In the limit of low Reynolds numbers (creeping flow), the inertial terms are negligible, and the pressure gradient is balanced solely by the viscous drag exerted by the solid matrix of the porous medium on the fluid. This leads to Darcy's Law, which establishes the required proportionality between the mean pressure gradient and the superficial velocity, $U_s$. The superficial velocity is defined as the volumetric flow rate, $\\dot{V}$, divided by the total cross-sectional area normal to the flow, $A$.\n\n$U_s = \\frac{\\dot{V}}{A}$\n\nDarcy's Law is expressed as:\n$$-\\frac{dp}{dx} = \\frac{\\mu_\\ell}{K} U_s$$\nwhere $\\mu_\\ell$ is the dynamic viscosity of the liquid and $K$ is the permeability of the porous wick. The negative sign indicates that the pressure decreases in the direction of flow. The magnitude of the pressure gradient is therefore $|\\frac{dp}{dx}| = \\frac{\\mu_\\ell}{K} U_s$.\n\nTo find the total pressure drop, $\\Delta p_\\ell$, across the wick of thickness (length) $L_w$, we integrate the pressure gradient over this length. Assuming the properties $K$, $\\mu_\\ell$, and the flow rate $\\dot{V}$ (and thus $U_s$) are constant along the flow path, the pressure gradient is constant.\n$$\\Delta p_\\ell = \\int_{0}^{L_w} \\left(-\\frac{dp}{dx}\\right) dx = \\left(\\frac{\\mu_\\ell}{K} U_s\\right) L_w$$\nSubstituting the expression for the superficial velocity, $U_s = \\frac{\\dot{V}}{A}$, we obtain the expression for the total liquid pressure drop:\n$$\\Delta p_\\ell = \\frac{\\mu_\\ell L_w \\dot{V}}{K A}$$\nUsing the provided data: $L_w = 2.0 \\times 10^{-3}\\ \\mathrm{m}$, $A = 1.50 \\times 10^{-3}\\ \\mathrm{m^2}$, $K = 3.0 \\times 10^{-12}\\ \\mathrm{m^2}$, $\\mu_\\ell = 1.0 \\times 10^{-3}\\ \\mathrm{Pa \\cdot s}$, and $\\dot{V} = 1.20 \\times 10^{-7}\\ \\mathrm{m^3 \\, s^{-1}}$.\n$$\\Delta p_\\ell = \\frac{(1.0 \\times 10^{-3}\\ \\mathrm{Pa \\cdot s}) (2.0 \\times 10^{-3}\\ \\mathrm{m}) (1.20 \\times 10^{-7}\\ \\mathrm{m^3 \\, s^{-1}})}{(3.0 \\times 10^{-12}\\ \\mathrm{m^2}) (1.50 \\times 10^{-3}\\ \\mathrm{m^2})}$$\n$$\\Delta p_\\ell = \\frac{2.4 \\times 10^{-13}}{4.5 \\times 10^{-15}}\\ \\mathrm{Pa} = 53.333... \\ \\mathrm{Pa}$$\nRounded to four significant figures, the viscous pressure drop is $\\Delta p_\\ell = 53.33\\ \\mathrm{Pa}$.\n\nNext, we augment the momentum balance to include the inertial drag effects, which become significant at higher flow velocities. This is accomplished using the Forchheimer correction, resulting in the Darcy-Forchheimer equation for the pressure gradient magnitude:\n$$\\left|-\\frac{dp}{dx}\\right| = \\underbrace{\\frac{\\mu_\\ell}{K} U_s}_{\\text{Viscous Drag}} + \\underbrace{\\rho_\\ell \\beta U_s^2}_{\\text{Inertial Drag}}$$\nHere, $\\rho_\\ell$ is the liquid density and $\\beta$ is the inertial or Forchheimer coefficient.\n\nThe problem asks for the critical superficial velocity, $U_{s,\\mathrm{crit}}$, at which the inertial effects become comparable to the viscous resistance. This condition is defined by equating the magnitudes of the viscous and inertial terms in the pressure gradient equation:\n$$\\frac{\\mu_\\ell}{K} U_{s,\\mathrm{crit}} = \\rho_\\ell \\beta U_{s,\\mathrm{crit}}^2$$\nFor a non-trivial flow ($U_{s,\\mathrm{crit}} \\neq 0$), we can divide both sides by $U_{s,\\mathrm{crit}}$ to solve for the critical velocity:\n$$U_{s,\\mathrm{crit}} = \\frac{\\mu_\\ell}{\\rho_\\ell \\beta K}$$\nThe corresponding critical volumetric flow rate, $\\dot{V}_{\\mathrm{crit}}$, is found using the relation $\\dot{V}_{\\mathrm{crit}} = U_{s,\\mathrm{crit}} A$:\n$$\\dot{V}_{\\mathrm{crit}} = \\frac{\\mu_\\ell A}{\\rho_\\ell \\beta K}$$\nWe now evaluate this expression using the given data: $\\rho_\\ell = 1.000 \\times 10^{3}\\ \\mathrm{kg \\, m^{-3}}$ and $\\beta = 1.20 \\times 10^{7}\\ \\mathrm{m^{-1}}$.\n$$\\dot{V}_{\\mathrm{crit}} = \\frac{(1.0 \\times 10^{-3}\\ \\mathrm{Pa \\cdot s}) (1.50 \\times 10^{-3}\\ \\mathrm{m^2})}{(1.000 \\times 10^{3}\\ \\mathrm{kg \\, m^{-3}}) (1.20 \\times 10^{7}\\ \\mathrm{m^{-1}}) (3.0 \\times 10^{-12}\\ \\mathrm{m^2})}$$\n$$\\dot{V}_{\\mathrm{crit}} = \\frac{1.50 \\times 10^{-6}}{3.6 \\times 10^{-2}}\\ \\mathrm{m^3 \\, s^{-1}} = 0.041666... \\times 10^{-3}\\ \\mathrm{m^3 \\, s^{-1}} = 4.1666... \\times 10^{-5}\\ \\mathrm{m^3 \\, s^{-1}}$$\nRounded to four significant figures, the critical volumetric flow rate is $\\dot{V}_{\\mathrm{crit}} = 4.167 \\times 10^{-5}\\ \\mathrm{m^3 \\, s^{-1}}$.\n\nThe regime in which Forchheimer corrections become necessary is when the inertial drag term is no longer negligible compared to the viscous drag term. Our derivation of $U_{s,\\mathrm{crit}}$ identifies the superficial velocity at which these two terms are of equal magnitude. Therefore, the Forchheimer correction is required when the actual superficial velocity $U_s$ approaches or exceeds the critical superficial velocity $U_{s,\\mathrm{crit}}$. Equivalently, this can be stated in terms of the Forchheimer number, $Fo = \\frac{\\rho_\\ell \\beta K U_s}{\\mu_\\ell}$, which represents the ratio of inertial to viscous forces. The correction becomes important as $Fo$ approaches and exceeds unity, since $Fo = U_s / U_{s,\\mathrm{crit}}$.

The maximum capillary pressure head available to drive the liquid flow is given by the Laplace-Young equation. For a meniscus in a pore of effective radius $r_{\\text{eff}}$, this pressure is $\\Delta P_{\\text{cap, max}} = \\frac{2 \\sigma \\cos(\\theta)}{r_{\\text{eff}}}$, where $\\sigma$ is the surface tension and $\\theta$ is the contact angle. The factor of $2$ is standard for a simple cylindrical capillary, but any constant of proportionality would suffice as it will be absorbed into a collective constant.\n\n2.  The pressure drop required to drive the liquid flow through the porous wick is given by Darcy's law. For a one-dimensional flow over an effective length $L_{e}$ through a wick of cross-sectional area $A_{w}$, the liquid pressure drop $\\Delta P_{l}$ is related to the mass flow rate $\\dot{m}_{l}$ by:\n    $$ \\Delta P_{l} = \\left( \\frac{\\mu_{l} L_{e}}{\\rho_{l} A_{w}} \\right) \\frac{\\dot{m}_{l}}{K} $$\n    where $\\mu_l$ and $\\rho_l$ are the liquid dynamic viscosity and density, respectively, and $K$ is the intrinsic permeability of the wick.\n\n3.  At the capillary limit, the maximum sustainable heat load $Q_{\\max}$ corresponds to the maximum mass flow rate $\\dot{m}_{l, \\max}$. This occurs when the entire capillary pressure head is consumed by the viscous pressure drop in the liquid: $\\Delta P_{\\text{cap, max}} = \\Delta P_{l}$.\n    $$ \\frac{2 \\sigma \\cos(\\theta)}{r_{\\text{eff}}} = \\left( \\frac{\\mu_{l} L_{e}}{\\rho_{l} A_{w}} \\right) \\frac{\\dot{m}_{l, \\max}}{K} $$\n\n4.

The maximum heat transport rate is related to the maximum mass flow rate by the latent heat of vaporization, $h_{fg}$: $Q_{\\max} = \\dot{m}_{l, \\max} h_{fg}$.\n    $$ Q_{\\max} = \\left( \\frac{2 \\sigma \\rho_{l} A_{w} h_{fg}}{\\mu_{l} L_{e}} \\right) \\frac{K \\cos(\\theta)}{r_{\\text{eff}}} $$\n    Since all terms in the parenthesis are considered constant, we can define a single constant $C = \\frac{2 \\sigma \\rho_{l} A_{w} h_{fg}}{\\mu_{l} L_{e}}$. The relation simplifies to:\n    $$ Q_{\\max}(K, r_{\\text{eff}}, \\theta) = C \\frac{K \\cos(\\theta)}{r_{\\text{eff}}} $$\n\nTo perform the sensitivity analysis, we take the natural logarithm of this expression:\n$$ \\ln Q_{\\max} = \\ln C + \\ln K - \\ln r_{\\text{eff}} + \\ln(\\cos(\\theta)) $$\n\nNow, we compute the required partial derivatives evaluated at the nominal point $(K_{0}, r_{\\text{eff},0}, \\theta_{0})$.\n\nFor $K$: The sensitivity is expressed as a logarithmic derivative.\n$$ \\frac{\\partial \\ln Q_{\\max}}{\\partial \\ln K} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\ln K} (\\ln C + \\ln K - \\ln r_{\\text{eff}} + \\ln(\\cos(\\theta))) = 1 $$\nThis sensitivity is a constant, independent of the operating point.\n\nFor $r_{\\text{eff}}$: The sensitivity is also a logarithmic derivative.\n$$ \\frac{\\partial \\ln Q_{\\max}}{\\partial \\ln r_{\\text{eff}}} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\ln r_{\\text{eff}}} (\\ln C + \\ln K - \\ln r_{\\text{eff}} + \\ln(\\cos(\\theta))) = -1 $$\nThis sensitivity is also a constant.\n\nFor $\\theta$: The sensitivity is a standard partial derivative.\n$$ \\frac{\\partial \\ln Q_{\\max}}{\\partial \\theta} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\theta} (\\ln C + \\ln K - \\ln r_{\\text{eff}} + \\ln(\\cos(\\theta))) = \\frac{1}{\\cos(\\theta)} (-\\sin(\\theta)) = -\\tan(\\theta) $$\nThis sensitivity depends on the value of $\\theta$.\n\nWe can now calculate the magnitude-weighted contributions $c_{K}$, $c_{r}$, and $c_{\\theta}$.\n\nContribution from $K$:\n$$ c_{K} = \\left|\\frac{\\partial \\ln Q_{\\max}}{\\partial \\ln K}\\right| \\left|\\frac{\\Delta K}{K_{0}}\\right| = |1| \\cdot (0.30) = 0.30 $$\n\nContribution from $r_{\\text{eff}}$:\n$$ c_{r} = \\left|\\frac{\\partial \\ln Q_{\\max}}{\\partial \\ln r_{\\text{eff}}}\\right| \\left|\\frac{\\Delta r_{\\text{eff}}}{r_{\\text{eff},0}}\\right| = |-1| \\cdot (0.12) = 0.12 $$\n\nContribution from $\\theta$:\nThis must be evaluated at the nominal angle $\\theta_{0} = 18^{\\circ}$.

Units must be handled explicitly as specified.\n\nUse the following fluid properties (constant for all tests):\n- Liquid density: $\\rho_\\ell = 998\\,\\text{kg/m}^3$.\n- Dynamic viscosity: $\\mu_\\ell = 1.0\\times 10^{-3}\\,\\text{Pa}\\cdot\\text{s}$.\n- Surface tension: $\\sigma = 0.072\\,\\text{N/m}$.\n- Latent heat of vaporization: $h_{fg} = 2.26\\times 10^{6}\\,\\text{J/kg}$.\n- Gravitational acceleration: $g = 9.81\\,\\text{m/s}^2$.\n- Perfect wetting: $\\cos\\theta = 1$.\n\nGeometric and wick parameters shared unless otherwise specified:\n- Wick permeability: $K = 1.0\\times 10^{-11}\\,\\text{m}^2$.\n- Wick porosity: $\\varepsilon = 0.60$.\n- Wick axial flow area: $A_w = 1.0\\times 10^{-4}\\,\\text{m}^2$.\n\nTest suite (each defines $L_e$, $L_{\\text{sys}}$, $r_{\\text{eff}}$, and the applied heat rate $Q$ in watts):\n- Test 1 (finite-time dryout, “happy path”): $L_e = 0.10\\,\\text{m}$, $L_{\\text{sys}} = 0.50\\,\\text{m}$, $r_{\\text{eff}} = 5.0\\times 10^{-6}\\,\\text{m}$, $Q = 1000.0\\,\\text{W}$.\n- Test 2 (boundary condition at the capillary–evaporative limit): $L_e = 0.10\\,\\text{m}$, $L_{\\text{sys}} = 0.50\\,\\text{m}$, $r_{\\text{eff}} = 5.0\\times 10^{-6}\\,\\text{m}$. Here take $Q$ to be exactly the unique value that yields $h_{\\text{ss}} = L_e$ under the model derived from the principles above. Your program must compute this $Q$ internally from the provided constants and parameters before evaluating $t_{\\text{dry}}$. For reference, with the numerical values given, this critical $Q$ is on the order of $6.3\\times 10^{2}\\,\\text{W}$.\n- Test 3 (sustained operation, no dryout): $L_e = 0.10\\,\\text{m}$, $L_{\\text{sys}} = 0.50\\,\\text{m}$, $r_{\\text{eff}} = 5.0\\times 10^{-6}\\,\\text{m}$, $Q = 100.0\\,\\text{W}$.\n- Test 4 (immediate dryout due to insufficient initial column): $L_e = 0.35\\,\\text{m}$, $L_{\\text{sys}} = 0.30\\,\\text{m}$, $r_{\\text{eff}} = 5.0\\times 10^{-5}\\,\\text{m}$, $Q = 200.0\\,\\text{W}$.\n\nFinal output format: Your program should produce a single line of output containing the four results, in order for Tests 1–4, as a comma-separated list enclosed in square brackets. Each entry must be rounded to six decimal places in seconds. For example: “[12.345678,-1.000000,0.000000,98.765432]”.", "solution": "The problem requires the derivation of a one-dimensional transient model for the saturated height of a liquid column in a wick under adverse gravity and evaporative load, starting from fundamental principles. The validity of the problem statement is first confirmed, as it is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and all necessary parameters are provided.\n\nThe analysis proceeds as follows.\n\n1.  Derivation of the Governing Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE)\n\nThe foundation of the model is the principle of mass conservation for the liquid within the saturated portion of the wick. The control volume is a cylinder of height $h(t)$, porosity $\\varepsilon$, and cross-sectional area $A_w$. The liquid mass is $m_\\ell = \\rho_\\ell \\varepsilon A_w h(t)$. The conservation law is stated as:\n$$\n\\frac{d}{dt}\\left(\\rho_\\ell \\varepsilon A_w h\\right) = \\dot{m}_{\\text{in}} - \\dot{m}_{\\text{evap}}\n$$\nGiven that the liquid density $\\rho_\\ell$, porosity $\\varepsilon$, and wick area $A_w$ are constant, and with the provided definitions $\\dot{m}_{\\text{in}} = \\rho_\\ell A_w u$ (where $u$ is the Darcy velocity) and $\\dot{m}_{\\text{evap}} = Q/h_{fg}$, the equation becomes:\n$$\n\\rho_\\ell \\varepsilon A_w \\frac{dh}{dt} = \\rho_\\ell A_w u - \\frac{Q}{h_{fg}}\n$$\nThis simplifies to an expression for the rate of change of the saturated height, $h(t)$:\n$$\n\\frac{dh}{dt} = \\frac{u}{\\varepsilon} - \\frac{Q}{\\rho_\\ell \\varepsilon A_w h_{fg}}\n$$\nTo complete the ODE, an expression for the Darcy velocity $u$ is required. The flow is driven by capillary pressure and opposed by gravity and viscous drag. The pressure balance across the saturated column of height $h$ dictates that the maximum available capillary pressure, $\\Delta p_{\\text{cap}}$, must equal the sum of the hydrostatic pressure head and the viscous pressure drop:\n$$\n\\Delta p_{\\text{cap}} = \\rho_\\ell g h + \\Delta p_{\\text{visc}}\n$$\nThis balance is a direct consequence of integrating the provided form of Darcy's law over the liquid column length $h$. The viscous pressure drop over this length is given by Darcy's law as $\\Delta p_{\\text{visc}} = \\frac{\\mu_\\ell u h}{K}$. Substituting this into the pressure balance yields:\n$$\n\\Delta p_{\\text{cap}} = \\rho_\\ell g h + \\frac{\\mu_\\ell u h}{K}\n$$\nSolving for the Darcy velocity $u$:\n$$\nu = \\frac{K}{\\mu_\\ell h} (\\Delta p_{\\text{cap}} - \\rho_\\ell g h)\n$$\nThis expression correctly shows that upward flow ($u  0$) is possible only when the capillary pressure exceeds the hydrostatic head, i.e., $\\Delta p_{\\text{cap}}  \\rho_\\ell g h$.\nSubstituting this expression for $u$ into the mass balance equation gives the governing ODE for $h(t)$:\n$$\n\\frac{dh}{dt} = \\frac{1}{\\varepsilon} \\left[ \\frac{K}{\\mu_\\ell h} (\\Delta p_{\\text{cap}} - \\rho_\\ell g h) \\right] - \\frac{Q}{\\rho_\\ell \\varepsilon A_w h_{fg}}\n$$\nRearranging terms, we obtain a first-order, nonlinear ODE:\n$$\n\\frac{dh}{dt} = \\frac{K \\Delta p_{\\text{cap}}}{\\varepsilon \\mu_\\ell} \\frac{1}{h} - \\left( \\frac{K \\rho_\\ell g}{\\varepsilon \\mu_\\ell} + \\frac{Q}{\\rho_\\ell \\varepsilon A_w h_{fg}} \\right)\n$$\nFor conciseness, we define two constants, $A$ and $B$:\n$$\nA = \\frac{K \\Delta p_{\\text{cap}}}{\\varepsilon \\mu_\\ell} \\quad [\\text{units: m}^2/\\text{s}]\n$$\n$$\nB = \\frac{K \\rho_\\ell g}{\\varepsilon \\mu_\\ell} + \\frac{Q}{\\rho_\\ell \\varepsilon A_w h_{fg}} \\quad [\\text{units: m/s}]\n$$\nThe ODE is thus written as:\n$$\n\\frac{dh}{dt} = \\frac{A}{h} - B\n$$\n\n2.  Analysis of Operating Regimes\n\nThe behavior of the system depends on the initial saturated height $h(0) = h_0$, the evaporator height $L_e$, and the steady-state saturated height $h_{\\text{ss}}$.\n\nThe initial height $h_0$ is determined by the minimum of the maximum capillary rise height, $h_{\\text{cap}} = \\Delta p_{\\text{cap}} / (\\rho_\\ell g)$, and the total available system length, $L_{\\text{sys}}$. For perfect wetting ($\\cos\\theta=1$), $\\Delta p_{\\text{cap}} = 2\\sigma/r_{\\text{eff}}$.\n$$\nh_0 = \\min\\left(h_{\\text{cap}}, L_{\\text{sys}}\\right) \\quad \\text{where} \\quad h_{\\text{cap}} = \\frac{2\\sigma}{\\rho_\\ell g r_{\\text{eff}}}\n$$\nThe steady-state height $h_{\\text{ss}}$ is found by setting $dh/dt=0$:\n$$\n0 = \\frac{A}{h_{\\text{ss}}} - B \\implies h_{\\text{ss}} = \\frac{A}{B} = \\frac{\\frac{K \\Delta p_{\\text{cap}}}{\\varepsilon \\mu_\\ell}}{\\frac{K \\rho_\\ell g}{\\varepsilon \\mu_\\ell} + \\frac{Q}{\\rho_\\ell \\varepsilon A_w h_{fg}}} = \\frac{K \\Delta p_{\\text{cap}}}{K \\rho_\\ell g + \\frac{\\mu_\\ell Q}{\\rho_\\ell A_w h_{fg}}}\n$$\nThe three regimes are:\na) Immediate Dryout: If the initial liquid column does not reach the evaporator, $h_0 \\le L_e$. The time to dryout is $t_{\\text{dry}} = 0$.\nb) Sustained Operation: If the steady-state height is at or above the evaporator, $h_{\\text{ss}} \\ge L_e$, the wick remains saturated at the evaporator level indefinitely. There is no finite dryout time.\nc) Finite-Time Dryout: This occurs if $h_0  L_e$ and $h_{\\text{ss}}  L_e$. The column starts above the evaporator but recedes under the thermal load, eventually reaching $h(t_{\\text{dry}}) = L_e$.\n\n3.  Solution for Finite-Time Dryout\n\nFor the finite-time dryout regime, we must integrate the ODE from $h(0)=h_0$ to $h(t_{\\text{dry}})=L_e$:\n$$\ndt = \\frac{dh}{\\frac{A}{h} - B} = \\frac{h \\, dh}{A - B h}\n$$\n$$\nt_{\\text{dry}} = \\int_{h_0}^{L_e} \\frac{h}{A - B h} dh\n$$\nThe integral is evaluated as:\n$$\n\\int \\frac{h}{A - B h} dh = -\\frac{1}{B} \\int \\left(1 - \\frac{A}{A - Bh}\\right) dh = -\\frac{1}{B} \\left(h + \\frac{A}{B}\\ln|A - Bh|\\right)\n$$\nIn the finite-dryout regime, $h$ decreases from $h_0$ to $L_e$, with $h  h_{ss} = A/B$, so $Bh  A$ and $A-Bh  0$. Thus, $|A-Bh| = Bh - A$.\n$$\nt_{\\text{dry}} = \\left[-\\frac{h}{B} - \\frac{A}{B^2} \\ln(Bh - A) \\right]_{h_0}^{L_e}\n$$\n$$\nt_{\\text{dry}} = \\left(-\\frac{L_e}{B} - \\frac{A}{B^2} \\ln(BL_e - A)\\right) - \\left(-\\frac{h_0}{B} - \\frac{A}{B^2} \\ln(Bh_0 - A)\\right)\n$$\n$$\nt_{\\text{dry}} = \\frac{h_0 - L_e}{B} + \\frac{A}{B^2} \\ln\\left(\\frac{Bh_0 - A}{BL_e - A}\\right)\n$$\nSubstituting $A/B = h_{\\text{ss}}$ gives the final expression used for computation:\n$$\nt_{\\text{dry}} = \\frac{1}{B} \\left[ (h_0 - L_e) + h_{\\text{ss}} \\ln\\left(\\frac{h_0 - h_{\\text{ss}}}{L_e - h_{ss}}\\right) \\right]\n$$\nFor Test 2, a critical heat load $Q_{\\text{crit}}$ is specified such that $h_{\\text{ss}} = L_e$. This value is calculated by solving the steady-state equation for $Q$:\n$$\nQ_{\\text{crit}} = \\frac{K \\rho_\\ell^2 g A_w h_{fg}}{\\mu_\\ell} \\left( \\frac{h_{\\text{cap}}}{L_e} - 1 \\right)\n$$\nThis case falls on the boundary of sustained operation ($h_{ss} \\ge L_e$), so no finite dryout time exists.", "answer": "```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Derives and implements a 1D model for heat pipe dryout to solve the given test suite.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # --- Physical Constants (SI units) ---\n    RHO_L = 998.0  # Liquid density (kg/m^3)\n    MU_L = 1.0e-3  # Liquid dynamic viscosity (Pa.s)\n    SIGMA = 0.072   # Surface tension (N/m)\n    H_FG = 2.26e6   # Latent heat of vaporization (J/kg)\n    G = 9.81       # Gravitational acceleration (m/s^2)\n    COS_THETA = 1.0 # Perfect wetting\n\n    # --- Shared Geometric and Wick Parameters (SI units) ---\n    K = 1.0e-11   # Wick permeability (m^2)\n    EPSILON = 0.60  # Wick porosity\n    A_W = 1.0e-4    # Wick axial flow area (m^2)\n\n    # --- Test Suite Parameters ---\n    # Each tuple: (L_e [m], L_sys [m], r_eff [m], Q [W] or None)\n    test_cases = [\n        (0.10, 0.50, 5.0e-6, 1000.0), # Test 1\n        (0.10, 0.50, 5.0e-6, None),   # Test 2\n        (0.10, 0.50, 5.0e-6, 100.0),  # Test 3\n        (0.35, 0.30, 5.0e-5, 200.0)   # Test 4\n    ]\n\n    results = []\n\n    for params in test_cases:\n        L_e, L_sys, r_eff, Q = params\n\n        # 1.
