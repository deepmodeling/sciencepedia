The search interval is set to $[273.15\\,\\mathrm{K}, T_\\infty)$, and analysis confirms that $F(273.15) > 0$ and $F(T_\\infty) < 0$ for the given test cases, guaranteeing a unique solution exists within this bracket.\n\nFor each test case in the suite, this procedure is executed. The resulting value for $T_i$ is rounded to three decimal places and stored. The final output is a list of these temperatures.", "answer": "```python\n# The complete and runnable Python 3 code goes here.\n# Imports must adhere to the specified execution environment.\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy.optimize import brentq\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves for the interfacial temperature in a series of evaporative cooling\n    problems on a flat plate.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Define physical and chemical constants from the problem statement.\n    P_TOTAL = 101325.0  # Pa\n    R_UNIV = 8.314462618  # J/(mol.K)\n    R_AIR = 287.05  # J/(kg.K)\n    MU = 1.85e-5  # Pa.s\n    K_G = 0.026  # W/(m.K)\n    CP_AIR = 1007.0  # J/(kg.K)\n    D_AB = 2.50e-5  # m^2/s\n    MMHG_TO_PA = 133.322\n\n    # Antoine equation constants for water\n    A_ANT = 8.07131\n    B_ANT = 1730.63\n    C_ANT = 233.426\n\n    # Watson correlation constants for water latent heat\n    L_REF = 40650.0  # J/mol at T_ref\n    T_REF = 373.15  # K\n    T_CRIT = 647.096  # K\n    N_WATSON = 0.38\n\n    def p_sat_func(T_k):\n        \"\"\"Calculates water saturation pressure using Antoine equation.\"\"\"\n        # T_k is in Kelvin, formula needs Celsius.\n        T_c = T_k - 273.15\n        log10_p_mmhg = A_ANT - (B_ANT / (C_ANT + T_c))\n        p_mmhg = 10**log10_p_mmhg\n        return p_mmhg * MMHG_TO_PA\n\n    def l_vapor_func(T_k):\n        \"\"\"Calculates molar latent heat of vaporization using Watson correlation.\"\"\"\n        # T_k is in Kelvin.\n        frac = (1 - T_k / T_CRIT) / (1 - T_REF / T_CRIT)\n        return L_REF * (frac**N_WATSON)\n\n    test_cases = [\n        (2.0, 0.10, 303.15, 0.010),\n        (2.0, 0.50, 303.15, 0.010),\n        (2.0, 0.10, 303.15, 0.035),\n        (3.0, 0.20, 315.15, 0.005),\n        (5.0, 0.90, 300.15, 0.010),\n    ]\n\n    results = []\n\n    for case in test_cases:\n        U_inf, x, T_inf, y_A_inf = case\n\n        # Step 1: Calculate thermophysical properties at the bulk temperature T_inf.\n        rho = P_TOTAL / (R_AIR * T_inf)\n        nu = MU / rho\n        alpha = K_G / (rho * CP_AIR)\n        Pr = nu / alpha\n        Sc = nu / D_AB\n        C_total = P_TOTAL / (R_UNIV * T_inf)\n\n        # Step 2: Calculate Reynolds number and transfer coefficients.\n        Re_x = U_inf * x / nu\n        Nu_x = 0.332 * (Re_x**0.5) * (Pr**(1/3))\n        h_g = Nu_x * K_G / x\n        Sh_x = 0.332 * (Re_x**0.5) * (Sc**(1/3))\n        k_c = Sh_x * D_AB / x\n\n        # Step 3: Define the nonlinear equation for interfacial temperature T_i.\n        def equation_to_solve(T_i):\n            \"\"\"Represents the interfacial energy balance, F(T_i) = 0.\"\"\"\n            p_sat_i = p_sat_func(T_i)\n            y_A_i = p_sat_i / P_TOTAL\n            \n            # Check for physical consistency.\n            if y_A_i >= 1.0 or (1 - y_A_i) <= 0:\n                # Should not be reached with the chosen search interval\n                return np.inf\n\n            convective_heat = h_g * (T_inf - T_i)\n            log_term = np.log((1 - y_A_inf) / (1 - y_A_i))\n            latent_heat = k_c * C_total * log_term * l_vapor_func(T_i)\n            \n            return convective_heat - latent_heat\n\n        # Step 4: Solve for T_i using a numerical root-finder.\n        # The physical bounds for T_i are [273.15, T_inf).\n        lower_bound = 273.15\n        upper_bound = T_inf - 1e-9 # Epsilon to avoid T_i = T_inf exactly.\n        \n        # Brent's method is robust for a bracketed root.\n        T_i_sol = brentq(equation_to_solve, lower_bound, upper_bound)\n        \n        results.append(f\"{T_i_sol:.3f}\")\n\n    # Final print statement in the exact required format.\n    print(f\"[{','.join(results)}]\")\n\nsolve()\n```", "id": "2483038"}]}
