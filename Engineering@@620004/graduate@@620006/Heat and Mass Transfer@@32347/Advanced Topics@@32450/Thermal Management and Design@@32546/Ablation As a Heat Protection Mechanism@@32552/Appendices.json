Consider a one-dimensional differential control volume of cross-sectional area $A$ and thickness $dx$, located at position $x$. The energy balance equation is:\n$$ \\text{Rate of energy stored} = \\text{Rate of energy conduction in} - \\text{Rate of energy conduction out} $$\nIn mathematical terms, for a material with density $\\rho$ and specific heat $c_p$, this is written as:\n$$ (\\rho A dx) c_p \\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial t} = q_x^{\\prime\\prime} A - q_{x+dx}^{\\prime\\prime} A $$\nHere, $q_x^{\\prime\\prime}$ is the heat flux at position $x$.

A fraction $\\phi$ of this generated heat is conducted into the solid, acting as an additional heat load. Therefore, the net heat flux into the solid is:\n$$\n\\dot{q}''_{net,solid} = \\dot{q}''_{ext} + \\phi \\dot{m}''_{O} \\Delta h_{ox}\n$$\nBy equating the expressions for the net heat flux absorbed by the solid, we establish the overall energy balance:\n$$\n\\dot{q}''_{ext} + \\phi \\dot{m}''_{O} \\Delta h_{ox} = \\dot{m}''_{s} H_0\n$$\n\nPart 1: The problem requires the derivation of an expression for the modified effective heat of ablation, $H_{\\mathrm{eff}}$, defined by the relation $\\dot{q}''_{ext} = \\dot{m}''_{s} H_{\\mathrm{eff}}$. To find this expression, we rearrange our energy balance equation to isolate $\\dot{q}''_{ext}$:\n$$\n\\dot{q}''_{ext} = \\dot{m}''_{s} H_0 - \\phi \\dot{m}''_{O} \\Delta h_{ox}\n$$\nBy comparing this result with the definition of $H_{\\mathrm{eff}}$, we have:\n$$\n\\dot{m}''_{s} H_{\\mathrm{eff}} = \\dot{m}''_{s} H_0 - \\phi \\dot{m}''_{O} \\Delta h_{ox}\n$$\nDividing by the surface regression mass flux, $\\dot{m}''_{s}$, we obtain the final expression for the effective heat of ablation in the presence of surface oxidation:\n$$\nH_{\\mathrm{eff}} = H_0 - \\phi \\Delta h_{ox} \\left(\\frac{\\dot{m}''_{O}}{\\dot{m}''_{s}}\\right)\n$$\nThis expression shows that the effective heat of ablation is the inert value $H_0$ reduced by a term accounting for the heat generation due to oxidation.\n\nPart 2: We are asked to evaluate $H_{\\mathrm{eff}}$ using the provided numerical data. The given values are:\n$H_{0} = 10.0 \\, \\text{MJ/kg}$\n$\\dot{m}''_{O} = 0.40 \\, \\text{kg/(m}^2\\text{s)}$\n$\\dot{m}''_{s} = 0.50 \\, \\text{kg/(m}^2\\text{s)}$\n$\\Delta h_{ox} = 12.3 \\, \\text{MJ/kg}$\n$\\phi = 0.50$\n\nSubstituting these values into the derived expression for $H_{\\mathrm{eff}}$:\n$$\nH_{\\mathrm{eff}} = 10.0 - (0.50)(12.3) \\left(\\frac{0.40}{0.50}\\right)\n$$\nFirst, we compute the term corresponding to the oxidation effect:\n$$\n\\phi \\Delta h_{ox} \\left(\\frac{\\dot{m}''_{O}}{\\dot{m}''_{s}}\\right) = 0.50 \\times 12.3 \\times 0.80 = 6.15 \\times 0.80 = 4.92 \\, \\text{MJ/kg}\n$$\nNow, we subtract this value from $H_0$:\n$$\nH_{\\mathrm{eff}} = 10.0 - 4.92 = 5.08 \\, \\text{MJ/kg}\n$$\nThe value is required to three significant figures, which is $5.08$.\n\nPart 3: We must analyze the conditions under which oxidation tends to elevate the surface temperature and accelerate recession for a fixed external heat flux, $\\dot{q}''_{ext}$.\nThe surface recession rate is given by $\\dot{m}''_{s} = \\frac{\\dot{q}''_{ext}}{H_{\\mathrm{eff}}}$. For a fixed $\\dot{q}''_{ext}$, the recession rate $\\dot{m}''_{s}$ will be accelerated if $H_{\\mathrm{eff}}$ is decreased.\nFrom our derived expression, $H_{\\mathrm{eff}} = H_0 - \\phi \\Delta h_{ox} \\left(\\frac{\\dot{m}''_{O}}{\\dot{m}''_{s}}\\right)$, it is evident that $H_{\\mathrm{eff}}$ decreases when the subtracted term, $\\phi \\Delta h_{ox} (\\frac{\\dot{m}''_{O}}{\\dot{m}''_{s}})$, is positive and large. This occurs under the following conditions:\n1.  The reaction must be exothermic, which means $\\Delta h_{ox} > 0$. An endothermic reaction ($\\Delta h_{ox} < 0$) would absorb energy and increase $H_{\\mathrm{eff}}$, thus passivating the surface.\n2.  A significant fraction of the heat generated must be transferred into the solid, meaning $\\phi > 0$. If $\\phi = 0$, all oxidation heat is rejected to the gas, and $H_{\\mathrm{eff}} = H_0$, so the recession rate is unaffected by the chemistry for a given $\\dot{m}''_{s}$.\n3.  The ratio of oxidizer mass flux to surface regression mass flux, $\\frac{\\dot{m}''_{O}}{\\dot{m}''_{s}}$, must be large. This ratio indicates the amount of chemical reaction occurring per unit mass of ablated material. A higher ratio signifies a stronger chemical heating effect relative to the inert energy absorption capacity.\n\nThe elevation of surface temperature is directly linked to the recession rate. For a given ablative material, the rate of surface recession ($\\dot{m}''_s$) is a strong, typically Arrhenius-type, function of the surface temperature ($T_s$). A higher recession rate requires a higher surface temperature to drive the underlying decomposition, vaporization, and reaction kinetics. Since the conditions above lead to a higher recession rate for a fixed external heat flux, they will consequently necessitate an elevated surface temperature to sustain this accelerated process. In summary, strongly exothermic reactions with significant heat conduction into the solid and a high availability of oxidizer relative to the ablation rate will degrade the thermal protection performance by decreasing $H_{\\mathrm{eff}}$, which manifests as accelerated surface recession and higher surface temperatures.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{5.08}\n$$", "id": "2467652"}]}
