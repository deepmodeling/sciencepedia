The data provided for water properties and contact angles are physically realistic. The problem is scientifically sound.\n2.  **Well-Posedness**: The problem is well-posed. It provides all necessary information and clear, non-contradictory assumptions to derive a unique and meaningful solution. The objectives are stated unambiguously.\n3.  **Objectivity**: The problem is formulated with precise, objective language, free of subjective claims or ambiguity.\n\nThe problem exhibits no flaws; it is scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and complete. Therefore, it is deemed valid, and a solution will be furnished.\n\nThe derivation for the capillary pressure jump, $\\Delta P_c$, begins with the Young-Laplace equation, which relates the pressure difference across a curved interface to the surface tension and the principal radii of curvature, $R_1$ and $R_2$:\n$$ \\Delta P = \\sigma_{\\ell v} \\left( \\frac{1}{R_1} + \\frac{1}{R_2} \\right) $$\nFor a liquid-vapor meniscus formed at the mouth of a circular pore, the interface is assumed to be a segment of a sphere due to axisymmetry. For a spherical surface, the two principal radii of curvature are equal, $R_1 = R_2 = R_{\\text{meniscus}}$, where $R_{\\text{meniscus}}$ is the radius of curvature of the meniscus. The equation simplifies to:\n$$ \\Delta P_c = \\frac{2 \\sigma_{\\ell v}}{R_{\\text{meniscus}}} $$\nThe pressure jump, $\\Delta P_c = P_{\\text{vapor}} - P_{\\text{liquid}}$, represents the capillary suction that draws liquid into the pore.\n\nNext, a geometric relationship between the meniscus radius $R_{\\text{meniscus}}$, the pore radius $r$, and the static contact angle $\\theta$ must be established. The contact angle $\\theta$ is defined as the angle between the tangent to the liquid-vapor interface and the solid surface, measured through the liquid phase. For a circular pore of radius $r$, a cross-sectional view shows that the radius of the sphere forming the meniscus, $R_{\\text{meniscus}}$, and the pore radius $r$ are related through the contact angle. From the geometric construction at the three-phase contact line, the pore radius is the horizontal projection of the meniscus radius of curvature. This gives the relation:\n$$ r = R_{\\text{meniscus}} \\cos(\\theta) $$\nThis relation is valid for $\\theta < 90^{\\circ}$, which corresponds to a wetting (hydrophilic) surface where the meniscus is concave as viewed from the vapor side.\nRearranging for $R_{\\text{meniscus}}$ yields:\n$$ R_{\\text{meniscus}} = \\frac{r}{\\cos(\\theta)} $$\nSubstituting this expression for $R_{\\text{meniscus}}$ back into the simplified Young-Laplace equation gives the desired expression for the capillary pressure jump sustained by the meniscus:\n$$ \\Delta P_c = \\frac{2 \\sigma_{\\ell v} \\cos(\\theta)}{r} $$\nThis expression shows that the maximum sustainable capillary pressure is directly proportional to the cosine of the contact angle. For a hydrophilic surface ($0^{\\circ} \\le \\theta < 90^{\\circ}$), $\\cos(\\theta)$ is positive, resulting in a pressure drop across the interface that drives liquid suction. The suction is maximized as $\\theta$ approaches $0^{\\circ}$.\n\nTo find the multiplicative factor by which the maximum capillary pressure increases, we compute the ratio of the final pressure, $\\Delta P_{c,1}$, to the initial pressure, $\\Delta P_{c,0}$. Let $\\theta_0 = 70^{\\circ}$ and $\\theta_1 = 10^{\\circ}$. The factor, $F$, is:\n$$ F = \\frac{\\Delta P_{c,1}}{\\Delta P_{c,0}} = \\frac{\\frac{2 \\sigma_{\\ell v} \\cos(\\theta_1)}{r}}{\\frac{2 \\sigma_{\\ell v} \\cos(\\theta_0)}{r}} $$\nThe terms $2$, $\\sigma_{\\ell v}$, and $r$ are constant and cancel out, leaving a simple ratio of the cosines of the angles:\n$$ F = \\frac{\\cos(\\theta_1)}{\\cos(\\theta_0)} = \\frac{\\cos(10^{\\circ})}{\\cos(70^{\\circ})} $$\nSubstituting the numerical values for the trigonometric functions:\n$$ F \\approx \\frac{0.98480775}{0.34202014} \\approx 2.8794 $$\nRounding to three significant figures, the multiplicative factor is $2.88$.\n\nThe implication of this change for Critical Heat Flux (CHF) is significant. CHF is the upper limit of heat flux in nucleate boiling, beyond which a stable vapor film insulates the heating surface, causing a rapid and dangerous temperature excursion (burnout). A key mechanism governing CHF on porous or structured surfaces is the rewetting of the surface, which is the resupply of liquid to areas of intense evaporation. This resupply is driven by capillary action, or wicking. The capillary pressure, $\\Delta P_c$, is the driving force for this wicking. By applying a hydrophilic nano-coating, the contact angle is drastically reduced from $\\theta_0 = 70^{\\circ}$ to $\\theta_1 = 10^{\\circ}$. As demonstrated by the calculation, this nearly triples the capillary suction pressure. This enhanced suction provides a much stronger capability to replenish the liquid at the heated surface, counteracting the formation of dry patches that would otherwise trigger the transition to film boiling. Consequently, the surface can sustain a significantly higher heat flux before failure, resulting in a substantial enhancement of the Critical Heat Flux.", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{2.88} $$", "id": "2475819"}, {"introduction": "Building upon the principle of capillary action, this practice delves into a more complex engineering design challenge: optimizing the geometry of a porous wick structure.

Substituting these into the formula:\n$$ \\theta_s(t) = 0 \\cdot \\phi_s(t) + \\int_0^t \\left( \\frac{2}{k} \\sqrt{\\frac{\\alpha(t-\\tau)}{\\pi}} \\right) \\beta \\, d\\tau $$\n$$ \\theta_s(t) = \\frac{2 \\beta \\sqrt{\\alpha}}{k \\sqrt{\\pi}} \\int_0^t (t-\\tau)^{1/2} \\, d\\tau $$\nThe integral is evaluated as:\n$$ \\int_0^t (t-\\tau)^{1/2} \\, d\\tau = \\left[ -\\frac{2}{3} (t-\\tau)^{3/2} \\right]_0^t = -\\frac{2}{3}(0) - \\left(-\\frac{2}{3}t^{3/2}\\right) = \\frac{2}{3}t^{3/2} $$\nSubstituting the result of the integral back into the expression for $\\theta_s(t)$:\n$$ \\theta_s(t) = \\frac{2 \\beta \\sqrt{\\alpha}}{k \\sqrt{\\pi}} \\left( \\frac{2}{3}t^{3/2} \\right) = \\frac{4 \\beta \\sqrt{\\alpha}}{3 k \\sqrt{\\pi}} t^{3/2} $$\nBy substituting $\\alpha = k/(\\rho c)$, we express the surface temperature rise in terms of the fundamental properties:\n$$ \\theta_s(t) = \\frac{4 \\beta \\sqrt{k/(\\rho c)}}{3 k \\sqrt{\\pi}} t^{3/2} = \\frac{4 \\beta}{3 \\sqrt{\\pi k \\rho c}} t^{3/2} $$\nThis equation gives the evolution of the heater surface superheat, $T_s(t) - T_{\\mathrm{sat}}$, as governed by heat conduction into the substrate.\n\nTransient Critical Heat Flux (CHF) is defined to occur at a time $t_{\\mathrm{CHF}}$ when the surface superheat reaches a critical value, $\\Delta T_{\\mathrm{crit}}$.\n$$ \\theta_s(t_{\\mathrm{CHF}}) = \\Delta T_{\\mathrm{crit}} $$\n$$ \\frac{4 \\beta}{3 \\sqrt{\\pi k \\rho c}} t_{\\mathrm{CHF}}^{3/2} = \\Delta T_{\\mathrm{crit}} $$\nWe solve for the time to CHF, $t_{\\mathrm{CHF}}$:\n$$ t_{\\mathrm{CHF}}^{3/2} = \\frac{3 \\sqrt{\\pi k \\rho c} \\, \\Delta T_{\\mathrm{crit}}}{4 \\beta} $$\n$$ t_{\\mathrm{CHF}} = \\left( \\frac{3 \\sqrt{\\pi k \\rho c} \\, \\Delta T_{\\mathrm{crit}}}{4 \\beta} \\right)^{2/3} $$\nThe value of the transient CHF, $q''_{\\mathrm{CHF}}$, is the heat flux at this instant:\n$$ q''_{\\mathrm{CHF}} = q''(t_{\\mathrm{CHF}}) = \\beta t_{\\mathrm{CHF}} $$\n$$ q''_{\\mathrm{CHF}} = \\beta \\left( \\frac{3 \\sqrt{\\pi k \\rho c} \\, \\Delta T_{\\mathrm{crit}}}{4 \\beta} \\right)^{2/3} = \\beta \\cdot \\left(\\frac{3}{4}\\right)^{2/3} (\\pi k \\rho c)^{1/3} (\\Delta T_{\\mathrm{crit}})^{2/3} \\beta^{-2/3} $$\nThis simplifies to the analytical expression for the transient CHF:\n$$ q''_{\\mathrm{CHF}} = \\left(\\frac{3}{4}\\right)^{2/3} \\pi^{1/3} \\beta^{1/3} (k \\rho c)^{1/3} (\\Delta T_{\\mathrm{crit}})^{2/3} $$\nThe problem asks for the ratio of the transient CHF for a copper (Cu) substrate to that for a stainless steel (SS) substrate under the same ramp rate $\\beta$ and critical superheat $\\Delta T_{\\mathrm{crit}}$.\n$$ \\frac{q''_{\\mathrm{CHF,Cu}}}{q''_{\\mathrm{CHF,SS}}} = \\frac{\\left(\\frac{3}{4}\\right)^{2/3} \\pi^{1/3} \\beta^{1/3} (k \\rho c)_{\\mathrm{Cu}}^{1/3} (\\Delta T_{\\mathrm{crit}})^{2/3}}{\\left(\\frac{3}{4}\\right)^{2/3} \\pi^{1/3} \\beta^{1/3} (k \\rho c)_{\\mathrm{SS}}^{1/3} (\\Delta T_{\\mathrm{crit}})^{2/3}} $$\nAll terms cancel except for the substrate thermal properties, yielding the simple ratio:\n$$ \\frac{q''_{\\mathrm{CHF,Cu}}}{q''_{\\mathrm{CHF,SS}}} = \\left( \\frac{(k \\rho c)_{\\mathrm{Cu}}}{(k \\rho c)_{\\mathrm{SS}}} \\right)^{1/3} $$\nThe term $k \\rho c$ is the thermal product.

This indicates that the high-diffusivity (and high-effusivity) copper substrate can sustain a transient heat flux $2.78$ times higher than the stainless steel substrate before reaching the critical superheat, demonstrating the significant role of substrate heat spreading in delaying dryout.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{2.78}$$", "id": "2475802"}]}
