All fluid properties are constant, and the Knudsen number is sufficiently small that the no-slip boundary condition holds at all walls. The streamwise pressure gradient is uniform, and the flow is fully developed in the hydrodynamic sense. Because the aspect ratio is large, assume that variations of the axial velocity across the wide dimension are negligible so that the flow may be modeled as being between two parallel plates separated by a gap $H$.

The geometry is a microchannel with a large aspect ratio ($W/H \\ge 20$), which permits the simplification of the flow as being between two infinite parallel plates separated by a distance $H$. Let the $x$-axis be the direction of flow and the $y$-axis be perpendicular to the plates, with the origin at the centerline. The plates are located at $y = \\pm H/2$.\n\nFor fully developed flow, the axial velocity component, $u$, is a function of $y$ only, i.e., $u = u(y)$, and the velocity components in the other directions are zero. The Navier-Stokes equations simplify significantly under these conditions. The $x$-momentum equation reduces to a balance between the pressure gradient and viscous forces:\n$$\n\\frac{d^2u}{dy^2} = \\frac{1}{\\mu} \\frac{dp}{dx}\n$$\nwhere $\\mu$ is the dynamic viscosity and $\\frac{dp}{dx}$ is the constant streamwise pressure gradient. Since the flow is driven by a pressure drop, $\\frac{dp}{dx}$ is a negative constant.\n\nWe integrate this equation twice with respect to $y$. The first integration yields:\n$$\n\\frac{du}{dy} = \\frac{1}{\\mu} \\frac{dp}{dx} y + C_1\n$$\nDue to the symmetry of the flow about the centerline ($y=0$), the velocity profile must have a zero gradient at this point. Applying the condition $\\frac{du}{dy}\\Big|_{y=0} = 0$, we find that the first integration constant $C_1 = 0$.\n\nIntegrating a second time gives the velocity profile:\n$$\nu(y) = \\frac{1}{2\\mu} \\frac{dp}{dx} y^2 + C_2\n$$\nThe second integration constant, $C_2$, is determined by applying the no-slip boundary condition at the walls, where the fluid velocity is zero. At the upper wall ($y = H/2$), we have $u(H/2) = 0$:\n$$\n0 = \\frac{1}{2\\mu} \\frac{dp}{dx} \\left(\\frac{H}{2}\\right)^2 + C_2\n$$\nSolving for $C_2$, we get:\n$$\nC_2 = -\\frac{1}{8\\mu} \\frac{dp}{dx} H^2\n$$\nSubstituting $C_2$ back into the expression for $u(y)$, we obtain the axial velocity profile:\n$$\nu(y) = \\frac{1}{2\\mu} \\frac{dp}{dx} y^2 - \\frac{1}{8\\mu} \\frac{dp}{dx} H^2 = \\frac{1}{2\\mu} \\frac{dp}{dx} \\left(y^2 - \\frac{H^2}{4}\\right)\n$$\nThis is the characteristic parabolic velocity profile for plane Poiseuille flow. Let us define the positive pressure gradient magnitude $G = -\\frac{dp}{dx}$. The velocity profile can be written as:\n$$\nu(y) = \\frac{G}{2\\mu} \\left(\\frac{H^2}{4} - y^2\\right)\n$$\nThe maximum velocity, $u_{\\max}$, occurs at the centerline ($y=0$):\n$$\nu_{\\max} = u(0) = \\frac{G H^2}{8\\mu}\n$$\nNext, we compute the mean velocity, $\\bar{u}$, by integrating the velocity profile over the cross-section and dividing by the height $H$:\n$$\n\\bar{u} = \\frac{1}{H} \\int_{-H/2}^{H/2} u(y) \\,dy = \\frac{1}{H} \\int_{-H/2}^{H/2} \\frac{G}{2\\mu} \\left(\\frac{H^2}{4} - y^2\\right) \\,dy\n$$\nSince the integrand is an even function, we can simplify the integral:\n$$\n\\bar{u} = \\frac{2}{H} \\int_{0}^{H/2} \\frac{G}{2\\mu} \\left(\\frac{H^2}{4} - y^2\\right) \\,dy = \\frac{G}{\\mu H} \\left[ \\frac{H^2}{4}y - \\frac{y^3}{3} \\right]_0^{H/2}\n$$\nEvaluating the integral at the limits:\n$$\n\\bar{u} = \\frac{G}{\\mu H} \\left( \\frac{H^2}{4}\\left(\\frac{H}{2}\\right) - \\frac{(H/2)^3}{3} \\right) = \\frac{G}{\\mu H} \\left( \\frac{H^3}{8} - \\frac{H^3}{24} \\right) = \\frac{G}{\\mu H} \\left( \\frac{3H^3 - H^3}{24} \\right) = \\frac{G}{\\mu H} \\left( \\frac{2H^3}{24} \\right)\n$$\n$$\n\\bar{u} = \\frac{G H^2}{12\\mu}\n$$\nThe profile shape factor, $S$, is defined as the ratio of the maximum to the mean velocity, $S \\equiv u_{\\max} / \\bar{u}$.\n$$\nS = \\frac{u_{\\max}}{\\bar{u}} = \\frac{G H^2 / (8\\mu)}{G H^2 / (12\\mu)} = \\frac{12}{8} = \\frac{3}{2}\n$$\nThus, the shape factor is $S = 1.5$.\n\nFor the second part of the problem, we address the scaling of the thermal entrance length, $x_{et}$. This length is estimated by balancing axial heat convection against transverse heat conduction. The scaling relation is:\n$$\n\\text{Axial Convection} \\sim \\text{Transverse Conduction}\n$$\n$$\n\\rho c_p u_{\\text{char}} \\frac{T}{x_{et}} \\sim k \\frac{T}{H^2}\n$$\nwhere $\\rho$ is density, $c_p$ is specific heat, $k$ is thermal conductivity, $u_{\\text{char}}$ is a characteristic velocity, and $H$ is the characteristic length for conduction. This gives the scaling for the entrance length:\n$$\nx_{et} \\sim \\frac{\\rho c_p u_{\\text{char}} H^2}{k} = \\frac{u_{\\text{char}} H^2}{\\alpha}\n$$\nwhere $\\alpha = k/(\\rho c_p)$ is the thermal diffusivity. We express this in terms of the Reynolds number $\\mathrm{Re} = \\frac{\\bar{u} D_h}{\\nu}$ and Prandtl number $\\mathrm{Pr} = \\frac{\\nu}{\\alpha}$, using the hydraulic diameter $D_h = 2H$.\n$$\nx_{et} \\sim \\frac{u_{\\text{char}} (D_h/2)^2}{\\nu/\\mathrm{Pr}} = \\frac{u_{\\text{char}} D_h^2 \\mathrm{Pr}}{4\\nu}\n$$\nFor a plug-flow assumption, the velocity is uniform, $u(y) = \\bar{u}$. Thus, $u_{\\text{char}} = \\bar{u}$ and the shape factor $S=1$. The scaling becomes $x_{et} \\sim \\frac{\\bar{u} D_h^2 \\mathrm{Pr}}{4\\nu}$. Substituting $\\bar{u} = \\mathrm{Re}\\nu/D_h$, we get $x_{et}/D_h \\sim \\frac{1}{4}\\mathrm{Re}\\mathrm{Pr}$.\n\nFor the non-uniform parabolic profile, the heat is advected downstream primarily by the fast-moving fluid in the core of the channel. Therefore, a more appropriate characteristic velocity for convection is the maximum velocity, $u_{\\text{char}} = u_{\\max}$. The non-uniformity is captured by the shape factor $S = u_{\\max}/\\bar{u} = 3/2$. Substituting $u_{\\max} = S\\bar{u}$ into the scaling relation:\n$$\nx_{et} \\sim \\frac{S \\bar{u} D_h^2 \\mathrm{Pr}}{4\\nu}\n$$\nThe dimensionless thermal entrance length scaling is therefore modified by the shape factor $S$:\n$$\n\\frac{x_{et}}{D_h} \\sim \\frac{S}{4}\\mathrm{Re}\\mathrm{Pr}\n$$\nSince $S = 3/2 > 1$, the non-uniformity of the parabolic velocity profile increases the thermal entrance length by a factor of $S$ compared to a plug flow with the same mean velocity (i.e., same $\\mathrm{Re}$). The physical reason is that the high-velocity core fluid advects heat more rapidly downstream, effectively 'outrunning' the transverse diffusion of heat from the walls, which delays the merging of the thermal boundary layers and thus extends the thermal development region.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\frac{3}{2}}\n$$", "id": "2473062"}, {"introduction": "While theoretical models often assume perfect geometries, real-world microdevices are subject to manufacturing imperfections that can significantly affect performance.
