It does not violate any of the specified invalidity criteria.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. A solution will be constructed.\n\n**Solution Derivation**\n\nWe begin from first principles. Let the coordinate $x$ be directed normal to the film, with $x=0$ at the top surface and $x=L_{f}$ at the film-substrate interface. The temperature at the top surface is $T_{s} = T(0)$, and the temperature of the film at the interface is $T_{i,f} = T(L_{f})$.\n\nUnder steady-state, one-dimensional conditions with no internal heat generation, the heat flux $q''$ is constant throughout the film. Fourier's law of conduction is:\n$$q'' = -k_{f} \\frac{dT}{dx}$$\nTo find the temperature drop across the film, $\\Delta T_{film} = T_{s} - T_{i,f}$, we integrate this equation over the film thickness:\n$$\\int_{T_{s}}^{T_{i,f}} dT = -\\frac{q''}{k_{f}} \\int_{0}^{L_{f}} dx$$\n$$T_{i,f} - T_{s} = -\\frac{q'' L_{f}}{k_{f}}$$\nTherefore, the temperature drop across the film is:\n$$\\Delta T_{film} = T_{s} - T_{i,f} = \\frac{q'' L_{f}}{k_{f}}$$\nThis relationship can be expressed using the concept of thermal resistance per unit area. The conduction resistance of the film per unit area, $R''_{cond}$, is defined as:\n$$R''_{cond} = \\frac{L_{f}}{k_{f}}$$\nThus, the temperature drop across the film is $\\Delta T_{film} = q'' R''_{cond}$.\n\nNext, we consider the thermal boundary resistance at the film-substrate interface, located at $x=L_{f}$. There exists a temperature discontinuity at this interface. Let $T_{i,s}$ be the temperature of the substrate at the interface. The temperature drop across the interface, $\\Delta T_{int}$, is defined as $T_{i,f} - T_{i,s}$. The relationship between the heat flux and this temperature drop is given by the definition of the Kapitza resistance, $R_{K}$:\n$$q'' = \\frac{\\Delta T_{int}}{R_{K}} = \\frac{T_{i,f} - T_{i,s}}{R_{K}}$$\nFrom this, the temperature drop across the interface is:\n$$\\Delta T_{int} = q'' R_{K}$$\nThe problem states that the substrate resistance is negligible and its bulk is at a constant temperature $T_{b}$. This implies that $T_{i,s} = T_{b}$.\n\nThe total temperature drop from the film's top surface to the substrate bulk, $\\Delta T_{total}$, is the sum of the temperature drop across the film and the temperature drop across the interface. This is characteristic of a series thermal circuit.\n$$\\Delta T_{total} = T_{s} - T_{b} = (T_{s} - T_{i,f}) + (T_{i,f} - T_{i,s}) = \\Delta T_{film} + \\Delta T_{int}$$\nThe total thermal resistance per unit area, $R''_{total}$, is the sum of the individual resistances:\n$$R''_{total} = R''_{cond} + R_{K} = \\frac{L_{f}}{k_{f}} + R_{K}$$\nThe total temperature drop is related to the total resistance by $\\Delta T_{total} = q'' R''_{total}$.\n\nWe are asked to find the fraction, $f$, of the total temperature drop that occurs across the interface. This fraction is the ratio of the interfacial temperature drop to the total temperature drop:\n$$f = \\frac{\\Delta T_{int}}{\\Delta T_{total}}$$\nSubstituting the expressions derived above:\n$$f = \\frac{q'' R_{K}}{q'' R''_{total}} = \\frac{q'' R_{K}}{q'' \\left( \\frac{L_{f}}{k_{f}} + R_{K} \\right)}$$\nThe heat flux $q''$ cancels from the numerator and denominator, which is expected as the fraction should depend only on the relative resistances of the system components:\n$$f = \\frac{R_{K}}{\\frac{L_{f}}{k_{f}} + R_{K}}$$\nNow, we substitute the provided numerical values into this expression. First, we calculate the film's thermal resistance per unit area:\n$$R''_{cond} = \\frac{L_{f}}{k_{f}} = \\frac{3.0 \\times 10^{-8}\\ \\mathrm{m}}{1.00\\ \\mathrm{W\\,m^{-1}\\,K^{-1}}} = 3.0 \\times 10^{-8}\\ \\mathrm{m^{2}\\,K\\,W^{-1}}$$\nThe interfacial resistance is given as $R_{K} = 2.00 \\times 10^{-8}\\ \\mathrm{m^{2}\\,K\\,W^{-1}}$.\nNow we compute the fraction $f$:\n$$f = \\frac{2.00 \\times 10^{-8}\\ \\mathrm{m^{2}\\,K\\,W^{-1}}}{3.0 \\times 10^{-8}\\ \\mathrm{m^{2}\\,K\\,W^{-1}} + 2.00 \\times 10^{-8}\\ \\mathrm{m^{2}\\,K\\,W^{-1}}}$$\n$$f = \\frac{2.00 \\times 10^{-8}}{5.0 \\times 10^{-8}} = \\frac{2.00}{5.0} = 0.4$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be expressed as a decimal rounded to four significant figures.

It is a standard problem in the field of heat and mass transfer that can be solved by direct application of fundamental principles. We will proceed with the derivation as instructed.\n\nThe problem requires the derivation of an expression for the interfacial temperature discontinuity, $\\Delta T_{\\text{int}}$, starting from two fundamental statements: Fourier's law of heat conduction and the definition of area-specific thermal contact resistance.\n\nFirst, we consider Fourier's law for steady-state, one-dimensional heat conduction in the radial direction for a cylindrical coordinate system. The law relates the local heat flux, $q_{r}$, to the temperature gradient, $\\frac{dT}{dr}$.\n$$q_{r} = -k \\frac{dT}{dr}$$\nHere, $q_{r}$ represents the heat rate per unit area normal to the direction of heat flow, and $k$ is the thermal conductivity of the material.\n\nThe total heat rate, $Q$, passing through a cylindrical surface at a radial position $r$ with length $L$ is a product of the heat flux $q_{r}$ and the surface area $A_{r}$. For a cylinder, this area is given by $A_{r} = 2 \\pi r L$.\n$$Q = q_{r} A_{r} = q_{r} (2 \\pi r L)$$\nThe problem states that the system is under steady-state conditions, which implies that the total heat rate $Q$ is constant and independent of the radial position $r$. We can therefore express the local heat flux $q_{r}$ as a function of $Q$, $r$, and $L$.\n$$q_{r} = \\frac{Q}{A_{r}} = \\frac{Q}{2 \\pi r L}$$\nThis equation shows that while the total heat rate $Q$ is constant, the heat flux $q_{r}$ is a function of the radius $r$, decreasing as $r$ increases.\n\nNext, we use the definition of area-specific thermal contact resistance, $R_{c}$, as provided in the problem statement: the temperature discontinuity is equal to the local normal heat flux multiplied by $R_{c}$. The temperature discontinuity at the interface $r=r_{m}$ is defined as $\\Delta T_{\\text{int}} \\equiv T(r_{m}^{-}) - T(r_{m}^{+})$. The local normal heat flux at this interface is $q_{r}$ evaluated at $r=r_{m}$, which we denote as $q_{r,m}$.\nThe relationship is thus:\n$$\\Delta T_{\\text{int}} = q_{r,m} R_{c}$$\nTo find the expression for $\\Delta T_{\\text{int}}$, we substitute the expression for the local heat flux at the interface radius $r_{m}$ into this definition.

The other parameters provided in the problem, such as $k_{1}$, $k_{2}$, $T_{i}$, and $T_{o}$, are not necessary for this specific derivation, as we are instructed to treat $Q$ as a given quantity.\n\nRearranging the terms for clarity, we arrive at the final expression.\n$$\\Delta T_{\\text{int}} = \\frac{Q R_{c}}{2 \\pi r_{m} L}$$\nThis is the required closed-form analytic expression.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{Q R_{c}}{2 \\pi r_{m} L}}$$", "id": "2513171"}, {"introduction": "In practical engineering and experimental settings, thermal contact resistance is often an unknown quantity that must be determined from measurements.
