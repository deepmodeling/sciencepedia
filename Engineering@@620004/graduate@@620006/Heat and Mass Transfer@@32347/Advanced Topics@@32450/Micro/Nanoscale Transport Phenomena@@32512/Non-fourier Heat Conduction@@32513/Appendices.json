Let $\\bar{T}(x,s) = \\mathcal{L}\\{T(x,t)\\} = \\int_0^\\infty T(x,t) e^{-st} dt$.\nTransforming the PDE term by term:\n$$ \\mathcal{L}\\left\\{\\frac{\\partial^2 T}{\\partial x^2}\\right\\} = \\frac{d^2 \\bar{T}}{dx^2} $$\n$$ \\mathcal{L}\\left\\{\\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial t}\\right\\} = s\\bar{T}(x,s) - T(x,0) $$\n$$ \\mathcal{L}\\left\\{\\frac{\\partial^2 T}{\\partial t^2}\\right\\} = s^2\\bar{T}(x,s) - sT(x,0) - \\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial t}(x,0) $$\nApplying the initial conditions $T(x,0)=0$ and $\\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial t}(x,0)=0$, the transformed PDE becomes an ordinary differential equation (ODE) in $x$:\n$$ \\frac{d^2 \\bar{T}}{dx^2} = \\frac{1}{\\alpha} (s\\bar{T}) + \\frac{\\tau}{\\alpha} (s^2\\bar{T}) $$\n$$ \\frac{d^2 \\bar{T}}{dx^2} - \\left(\\frac{s}{\\alpha} + \\frac{\\tau s^2}{\\alpha}\\right) \\bar{T} = 0 $$\n$$ \\frac{d^2 \\bar{T}}{dx^2} - \\frac{s(1+s\\tau)}{\\alpha} \\bar{T} = 0 $$\nThe general solution to this ODE is:\n$$ \\bar{T}(x,s) = A(s) \\exp\\left(-x \\sqrt{\\frac{s(1+s\\tau)}{\\alpha}}\\right) + B(s) \\exp\\left(+x \\sqrt{\\frac{s(1+s\\tau)}{\\alpha}}\\right) $$\nThe boundary condition that $T(x,t)$ remains bounded as $x \\to \\infty$ implies that $\\bar{T}(x,s)$ must also remain bounded as $x \\to \\infty$. For $\\text{Re}(s) > 0$, the real part of the square root term is positive. Thus, the exponential term with the positive argument will grow without bound as $x \\to \\infty$. To maintain a bounded solution, we must set $B(s)=0$.\nThe solution is now:\n$$ \\bar{T}(x,s) = A(s) \\exp\\left(-x \\sqrt{\\frac{s(1+s\\tau)}{\\alpha}}\\right) $$\nNext, we apply the boundary condition at $x=0$. We have $T(0,t) = T_s H(t)$, which for $t>0$ is $T(0,t)=T_s$. Its Laplace transform is $\\bar{T}(0,s) = \\mathcal{L}\\{T_s\\} = T_s/s$.\nSetting $x=0$ in our solution for $\\bar{T}(x,s)$ yields $\\bar{T}(0,s) = A(s)$. Therefore, $A(s) = T_s/s$.\nThe solution in the Laplace domain is:\n$$ \\bar{T}(x,s) = \\frac{T_s}{s} \\exp\\left(-x \\sqrt{\\frac{\\tau}{\\alpha}} \\sqrt{s(s+1/\\tau)}\\right) $$\n\nTo find the solution $T(x,t)$, we must compute the inverse Laplace transform. Let us define the characteristic wave speed $c = \\sqrt{\\alpha/\\tau}$. The expression becomes:\n$$ \\bar{T}(x,s) = \\frac{T_s}{s} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{x}{c} \\sqrt{s^2 + \\frac{s}{\\tau}}\\right) $$\nCompleting the square inside the square root: $s^2 + s/\\tau = (s+1/(2\\tau))^2 - (1/(2\\tau))^2$.\n$$ \\bar{T}(x,s) = \\frac{T_s}{s} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{x}{c} \\sqrt{\\left(s+\\frac{1}{2\\tau}\\right)^2 - \\left(\\frac{1}{2\\tau}\\right)^2}\\right) $$\nWe use the time-shifting property of the Laplace transform, $\\mathcal{L}\\{e^{-at}f(t)\\} = F(s+a)$. Here, we have a shift of $a=1/(2\\tau)$. Let's denote $p = s+1/(2\\tau)$, so $s=p-1/(2\\tau)$. Let $t_f = x/c$. The expression to be inverted is:\n$$ \\bar{T}(x,s) = T_s \\frac{1}{p-1/(2\\tau)} \\exp\\left(-t_f \\sqrt{p^2 - (1/(2\\tau))^2}\\right) $$\nThis inverse transform is known in terms of Bessel functions. A general result states that for $\\mathcal{L}\\{F(t, t_f, a)\\} = \\frac{1}{s} \\exp(-t_f \\sqrt{s^2 - a^2})$, the solution $F(t, t_f, a)$ is given by:\n$$ F(t, t_f, a) = H(t-t_f) + a \\int_{t_f}^t \\frac{I_1(a\\sqrt{\\lambda^2 - t_f^2})}{\\sqrt{\\lambda^2 - t_f^2}} t_f d\\lambda $$\nwhere $I_1$ is the modified Bessel function of the first kind of order one.\nApplying the shifting theorem, our final solution for $T(x,t)$ is obtained by first taking the inverse transform with respect to $p$ and then multiplying by $e^{-t/(2\\tau)}$.\n$$ T(x,t) = T_s e^{-t/(2\\tau)} \\left[ H\\left(t - \\frac{x}{c}\\right) + \\frac{x}{c(2\\tau)} \\int_{x/c}^t e^{\\lambda/(2\\tau)} \\frac{I_1\\left(\\frac{1}{2\\tau}\\sqrt{\\lambda^2 - (x/c)^2}\\right)}{\\sqrt{\\lambda^2 - (x/c)^2}} d\\lambda \\right] $$\nThis is the complete analytical solution for the step response in terms of special functions and distributions.\n\n### Front Arrival Time Analysis\n**Cattaneo–Vernotte Model:**\nThe derived solution for $T(x,t)$ contains the Heaviside step function term $H(t - x/c)$. By definition, $H(z)=0$ for $z<0$ and $H(z)=1$ for $z>0$. The integral term is also non-zero only for $t > x/c$.\nThis means that for a given position $x>0$, the temperature $T(x,t)$ remains identically zero for all times $t < x/c$. The temperature first becomes non-zero at the precise moment $t = x/c$.\nThis time is the arrival time of the thermal wave front.\n$$ t_{\\mathrm{front}}(x) = \\frac{x}{c} $$\nSubstituting the definition of the wave speed $c = \\sqrt{\\alpha/\\tau}$:\n$$ t_{\\mathrm{front}}(x) = x \\sqrt{\\frac{\\tau}{\\alpha}} $$\nThis result demonstrates that the CV model predicts a finite propagation speed, $c$, for thermal disturbances. The effect of the boundary temperature change is not felt instantaneously but propagates as a wave through the medium.\n\n**Classical Fourier Model:**\nThe classical Fourier model is recovered by setting the relaxation time $\\tau = 0$. The governing PDE, $\\frac{\\partial^2 T}{\\partial x^2} = \\frac{1}{\\alpha} \\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial t} + \\frac{\\tau}{\\alpha} \\frac{\\partial^2 T}{\\partial t^2}$, reduces to the parabolic heat diffusion equation:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial^2 T}{\\partial x^2} = \\frac{1}{\\alpha} \\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial t} $$\nThe solution to this equation with the same initial and boundary conditions is a classical result:\n$$ T(x,t) = T_s \\text{erfc}\\left(\\frac{x}{2\\sqrt{\\alpha t}}\\right) $$\nwhere $\\text{erfc}$ is the complementary error function. The properties of the $\\text{erfc}$ function are such that $\\text{erfc}(z) > 0$ for any finite argument $z$. For any position $x>0$ and any time $t>0$, however small, the argument $\\frac{x}{2\\sqrt{\\alpha t}}$ is finite. Therefore, $T(x,t) > 0$ for all $x>0$ and all $t>0$.\nThis signifies that a thermal disturbance at $x=0$ is felt instantly, albeit infinitesimally, at all other points in the domain. The speed of propagation is infinite.\nTherefore, for the classical Fourier model, the front arrival time is:\n$$ t_{\\mathrm{front}}(x) = 0 \\quad (\\text{for any } x > 0) $$\n\n**Comparison:**\n- The Cattaneo–Vernotte model predicts a finite front arrival time $t_{\\mathrm{front}}(x) = x\\sqrt{\\tau/\\alpha}$, corresponding to a finite propagation speed $c = \\sqrt{\\alpha/\\tau}$. This is physically more realistic, as it respects causality.\n- The classical Fourier model predicts an instantaneous arrival, $t_{\\mathrm{front}}(x) = 0$, corresponding to an infinite propagation speed. This is a well-known physical paradox of the Fourier model.\n\nThe question asks for the analytic expression for the CV front arrival time. The dimensionality of the expression is $[L] \\sqrt{[T] / [L^2/T]} = [L] \\sqrt{[T^2]/[L^2]} = [L][T]/[L] = [T]$, which is time. The expression requested is thus a function of $x$, $\\tau$, and $\\alpha$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{x \\sqrt{\\frac{\\tau}{\\alpha}}}\n$$", "id": "2512772"}]}
