The analysis must be based on a ballistic-diffusive model derived from the phonon Boltzmann Transport Equation (BTE).\n\nThe governing microscopic equation for phonon transport in a gray, isotropic medium under the relaxation-time approximation is the steady-state BTE for phonon intensity $I(x, \\mu)$:\n$$ \\mu \\frac{\\partial I(x, \\mu)}{\\partial x} = -\\frac{I(x, \\mu) - I_0(T(x))}{\\Lambda} $$\nHere, $x$ is the spatial coordinate, $\\mu$ is the cosine of the angle between the phonon velocity and the $x$-axis, $\\Lambda$ is the phonon mean free path, and $I_0(T)$ is the equilibrium intensity at temperature $T$. For small temperature variations, $I_0(T)$ is related to the local temperature $T(x)$ via the volumetric specific heat capacity $C$ and an average phonon speed $v$ by $I_0(T) = \\frac{vCT}{4\\pi}$ plus an irrelevant constant.\n\nThe macroscopic energy conservation equation for steady-state one-dimensional heat flow with a source is:\n$$ \\frac{dS_x}{dx} = \\dot{q} $$\nwhere the heat flux $S_x$ is the first moment of the intensity:\n$$ S_x(x) = 2\\pi \\int_{-1}^{1} I(x, \\mu) \\mu \\, d\\mu $$\nIntegrating the energy conservation equation yields $S_x(x) = \\dot{q}x + C_0$. Due to the symmetric boundary conditions, the temperature profile must be symmetric about $x=L/2$, i.e., $T(x) = T(L-x)$. This implies the heat flux must be antisymmetric, $S_x(x) = -S_x(L-x)$, which requires $S_x(L/2)=0$. Applying this condition gives $C_0 = -\\dot{q}L/2$. Thus, the heat flux profile is uniquely determined:\n$$ S_x(x) = \\dot{q}\\left(x - \\frac{L}{2}\\right) $$\n\nIn the interior of the slab, far from the boundaries, the phonon distribution is only slightly perturbed from local equilibrium. We can use a $P_1$ (spherical harmonics) approximation for the intensity, which is a controlled closure scheme. This approximation is equivalent to $I(x, \\mu) \\approx I_0(T(x)) - \\mu \\Lambda \\frac{dI_0}{dx}$. Substituting this into the definition of heat flux yields Fourier's law:\n$$ S_x = -k \\frac{dT}{dx} $$\nThe bulk thermal conductivity $k$ is given in the problem. From kinetic theory, it is related to microscopic properties by $k = \\frac{1}{3}Cv\\Lambda$. The $P_1$ approximation correctly recovers this relation. Therefore, in the slab's interior, the temperature field, which we denote $T_f(x)$, is governed by:\n$$ S_x(x) = -k \\frac{dT_f}{dx} $$\nCombining this with macroscopic energy conservation, we obtain the heat diffusion equation for the interior:\n$$ -k \\frac{d^2 T_f}{dx^2} = \\dot{q} $$\nThe general solution for this interior (or \"fictitious\") temperature profile is a parabola:\n$$ T_f(x) = -\\frac{\\dot{q}}{2k}x^2 + C_1 x + C_2 $$\n\nThe constants $C_1$ and $C_2$ are determined by boundary conditions. The $P_1$ approximation is invalid in the Knudsen layers (of thickness $\\sim \\Lambda$) near the boundaries. To bridge the interior diffusive solution with the boundary condition, a temperature-jump (or slip) model is used.

In the linear response regime, the connection between this unknown function and a measured thermal response, $y_m$, is described by a Fredholm integral equation of the first kind:\n$$\ny_m = \\int_{\\Lambda_{\\min}}^{\\Lambda_{\\max}} S_m(\\Lambda)\\,\\phi(\\Lambda)\\,d\\Lambda\n$$\nHere, $S_m(\\Lambda)$ is a suppression kernel derived from the phonon Boltzmann transport equation. This kernel quantifies the contribution of phonons with mean free path $\\Lambda$ to the measurement $m$. The inverse problem of determining $\\phi(\\Lambda)$ from a set of measurements $\\{y_m\\}$ is notoriously ill-posed, primarily due to the smoothing nature of the integral operator.\n\nThe problem specifies two forms for the suppression kernel, corresponding to two experimental techniques:\n$1$. For Transient Thermal Grating (TTG), a spatial heating pattern with wavevector $q$ is imposed. The corresponding suppression kernel is given as:\n$$\nS_{\\mathrm{TTG}}(q,\\Lambda) = \\frac{1}{1 + (q\\,\\Lambda)^2}\n$$\nThis kernel indicates that phonons with $\\Lambda \\approx 1/q$ contribute most significantly to the signal, while contributions are suppressed for phonons with much longer or shorter mean free paths.\n\n$2$. For Time-Domain Thermoreflectance (TDTR), a surface is heated periodically at an angular frequency $\\omega$. Heat penetrates to a characteristic depth $\\mu = \\sqrt{2\\alpha/\\omega}$, where $\\alpha$ is the material's thermal diffusivity. The suppression kernel is approximated as:\n$$\nS_{\\mathrm{TDTR}}(\\mu,\\Lambda) = \\frac{1}{1 + \\Lambda/\\mu}\n$$\nThis form captures the reduced contribution from phonons whose mean free paths $\\Lambda$ are much larger than the thermal penetration depth $\\mu$.\n\nTo analyze this problem numerically, the integral equation is discretized. The continuous function $\\phi(\\Lambda)$ is represented by a vector $\\mathbf{x} \\in \\mathbb{R}^N$ of its values on a discrete grid of mean free paths, $\\{\\Lambda_j\\}_{j=1}^N$. The integral is approximated using a quadrature rule, specifically the trapezoidal rule, which transforms the set of integral equations into a linear system:\n$$\n\\mathbf{y} = \\mathbf{A}\\,\\mathbf{x}\n$$\nwhere $\\mathbf{y} \\in \\mathbb{R}^M$ is the vector of $M$ measurements, and $\\mathbf{A} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{M \\times N}$ is the system matrix. The elements of this matrix are given by $A_{m j} = S_m(\\Lambda_j)\\,w_j$, where $w_j$ are the trapezoidal quadrature weights corresponding to the grid points $\\Lambda_j$. For a non-uniform grid $\\{\\Lambda_j\\}_{j=0}^{N-1}$, the weights are:\n$$\nw_0 = \\frac{\\Lambda_1 - \\Lambda_0}{2}, \\quad w_j = \\frac{\\Lambda_{j+1} - \\Lambda_{j-1}}{2} \\text{ for } 1 \\le j \\le N-2, \\quad w_{N-1} = \\frac{\\Lambda_{N-1} - \\Lambda_{N-2}}{2}\n$$\n\nThe stability and solvability of the inverse problem are dictated by the properties of the matrix $\\mathbf{A}$, which are revealed by its singular value decomposition (SVD), $\\mathbf{A} = \\mathbf{U}\\mathbf{\\Sigma}\\mathbf{V}^T$. The singular values, $\\sigma_1 \\ge \\sigma_2 \\ge \\dots \\ge 0$, are the diagonal elements of $\\mathbf{\\Sigma}$. A rapid decay of singular values indicates that the problem is ill-conditioned: small noise in the measurements $\\mathbf{y}$ can lead to large, unphysical oscillations in the solution $\\mathbf{x}$.\n\nThe degree of ill-conditioning is quantified by the condition number, $\\kappa(\\mathbf{A})$. For ill-posed problems, many singular values are numerically indistinguishable from zero. Therefore, a numerical condition number is defined relative to the effective rank of the matrix. We use the definition:\n$$\n\\kappa(\\mathbf{A}) = \\frac{\\sigma_{\\max}}{\\sigma_{\\min}^{+}}\n$$\nwhere $\\sigma_{\\max} = \\sigma_1$ is the largest singular value, and $\\sigma_{\\min}^{+}$ is the smallest singular value that is strictly greater than a tolerance $\\tau$. The tolerance is set to $\\tau = \\varepsilon\\,\\max\\{M,N\\}\\,\\sigma_{\\max}$, where $\\varepsilon$ is the machine epsilon for double-precision floating-point numbers. This threshold separates the singular values that carry meaningful information from those dominated by numerical noise. A smaller condition number signifies a better-conditioned, more stable inversion.\n\nThe core of the task is to compare the conditioning for three scenarios:\n$1$. Using only TTG data, which forms the matrix $\\mathbf{A}_{\\mathrm{TTG}}$.\n$2$. Using only TDTR data, which forms the matrix $\\mathbf{A}_{\\mathrm{TDTR}}$.\n$3$. Using a combined dataset, which corresponds to vertically stacking the previous two matrices: $\\mathbf{A}_{\\mathrm{combined}} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\mathbf{A}_{\\mathrm{TTG}} \\\\ \\mathbf{A}_{\\mathrm{TDTR}} \\end{pmatrix}$.\n\nBy computing and comparing $\\kappa(\\mathbf{A}_{\\mathrm{TTG}})$, $\\kappa(\\mathbf{A}_{\\mathrm{TDTR}})$, and $\\kappa(\\mathbf{A}_{\\mathrm{combined}})$ for the provided test cases, we can quantitatively assess whether combining the two modalities yields a more robust experimental design. The expectation is that if TTG and TDTR provide complementary information (i.e., their kernels are sensitive to different ranges of $\\Lambda$), the combined operator will be better conditioned.\n\nThe following Python program implements this complete procedure. It constructs the specified matrices for each test case, computes their singular value spectra, and calculates the numerical condition numbers as defined. The results are then formatted and printed according to the problem specification.", "answer": "```python\n# The complete and runnable Python 3 code goes here.\n# Imports must adhere to the specified execution environment.\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves the problem of computing and comparing condition numbers for\n    heat transport inverse problems using TDTR, TTG, and combined data.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    def get_trapezoidal_weights(grid: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:\n        \"\"\"Computes trapezoidal rule weights for a non-uniform grid.\"\"\"\n        N = len(grid)\n        if N < 2:\n            return np.array([])\n        w = np.zeros(N)\n        w[0] = (grid[1] - grid[0]) / 2.0\n        w[-1] = (grid[-1] - grid[-2]) / 2.0\n        w[1:-1] = (grid[2:] - grid[:-2]) / 2.0\n        return w\n\n    def s_ttg(q: float, Lambda: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:\n        \"\"\"TTG suppression kernel.\"\"\"\n        return 1.0 / (1.0 + (q * Lambda)**2)\n\n    def s_tdtr(mu: float, Lambda: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:\n        \"\"\"TDTR suppression kernel.\"\"\"\n        return 1.0 / (1.0 + Lambda / mu)\n        \n    def calculate_condition_number(A: np.ndarray) -> float:\n        \"\"\"\n        Computes the numerical condition number based on SVD and a tolerance.\n        \"\"\"\n        if A.size == 0:\n            return np.inf\n\n        M, N = A.shape\n        if M == 0 or N == 0:\n            return np.inf\n\n        s = np.linalg.svd(A, compute_uv=False)\n        \n        s_max = s[0] if len(s) > 0 else 0.0\n        if s_max < np.finfo(float).tiny:\n            return np.inf\n            \n        eps = np.finfo(float).eps\n        tau = eps * max(M, N) * s_max\n        \n        s_positive = s[s > tau]\n        \n        if len(s_positive) == 0:\n            return np.inf\n        \n        # s is sorted descending, so the last element of s_positive is s_min_plus\n        s_min_plus = s_positive[-1] \n        \n        return s_max / s_min_plus\n\n    # Discretization setup as per problem statement\n    N_lambda = 300\n    lambda_min = 1e-8\n    lambda_max = 5e-5\n    Lambda_grid = np.logspace(np.log10(lambda_min), np.log10(lambda_max), N_lambda)\n    weights = get_trapezoidal_weights(Lambda_grid)\n\n    # Test cases definition\n    test_cases = [\n        # Case 1: Complementary sensitivities\n        {\n            \"alpha\": 1.0e-5,\n            \"ttg_lambdas\": np.logspace(np.log10(0.5e-6), np.log10(10e-6), 12),\n            \"tdtr_freqs\": np.logspace(np.log10(1e6), np.log10(1e7), 8),\n        },\n        # Case 2: Redundant/low-contrast sensitivities\n        {\n            \"alpha\": 1.0e-5,\n            \"ttg_lambdas\": np.logspace(np.log10(50e-6), np.log10(200e-6), 8),\n            \"tdtr_freqs\": np.logspace(np.log10(1e4), np.log10(5e4), 8),\n        },\n        # Case 3: Sparse data edge case\n        {\n            \"alpha\": 1.0e-5,\n            \"ttg_lambdas\": np.array([1e-6, 5e-6]),\n            \"tdtr_freqs\": np.array([2e6, 8e6]),\n        },\n    ]\n\n    results = []\n    \n    for case in test_cases:\n        alpha = case[\"alpha\"]\n        ttg_lambdas = case[\"ttg_lambdas\"]\n        tdtr_freqs = case[\"tdtr_freqs\"]\n\n        # Build A_ttg matrix\n        M_ttg = len(ttg_lambdas)\n        A_ttg = np.zeros((M_ttg, N_lambda))\n        for i, lambda_g in enumerate(ttg_lambdas):\n            q = 2 * np.pi / lambda_g\n            s_kernel_row = s_ttg(q, Lambda_grid)\n            A_ttg[i, :] = s_kernel_row * weights\n\n        # Build A_tdtr matrix\n        M_tdtr = len(tdtr_freqs)\n        A_tdtr = np.zeros((M_tdtr, N_lambda))\n        for i, f in enumerate(tdtr_freqs):\n            omega = 2 * np.pi * f\n            mu = np.sqrt(2 * alpha / omega)\n            s_kernel_row = s_tdtr(mu, Lambda_grid)\n            A_tdtr[i, :] = s_kernel_row * weights\n            \n        # Build A_combined matrix\n        A_combined = np.vstack((A_ttg, A_tdtr))\n        \n        # Calculate condition numbers\n        kappa_ttg = calculate_condition_number(A_ttg)\n        kappa_tdtr = calculate_condition_number(A_tdtr)\n        kappa_combined = calculate_condition_number(A_combined)\n        \n        results.append([kappa_ttg, kappa_tdtr, kappa_combined])\n\n    # Format output to match the required string representation precisely.\n    case_strs = []\n    for r in results:\n        num_strs = [f\"{num:.6f}\" for num in r]\n        case_strs.append(f\"[{','.join(num_strs)}]\")\n    \n    final_output = f\"[{','.join(case_strs)}]\"\n    print(final_output)\n\nsolve()\n```", "id": "2469468"}]}
