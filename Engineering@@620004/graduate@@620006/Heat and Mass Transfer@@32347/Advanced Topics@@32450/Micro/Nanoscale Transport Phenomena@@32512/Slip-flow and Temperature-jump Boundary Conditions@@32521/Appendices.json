The problem requires the derivation and calculation of the Knudsen number, $\\mathrm{Kn}$, and an assessment of the flow regime. The problem is scientifically grounded in the kinetic theory of gases, its parameters are physically realistic, and it is well-posed with sufficient information for a unique solution. Therefore, the problem is deemed valid and a formal solution can be constructed.\n\nWe begin from the fundamental postulates. For a dilute gas under the specified conditions, the ideal-gas model is an accurate representation. The ideal gas law in terms of number density, $n$, is given by:\n$$p = n k_{B} T$$\nwhere $n$ is the number of molecules per unit volume. From this relation, the number density can be expressed as:\n$$n = \\frac{p}{k_{B}T}$$\n\nThe next step is to define the molecular mean free path, $\\lambda$. For a gas composed of identical hard-sphere molecules, the mean free path is the average distance a molecule travels between successive collisions. Based on kinetic theory, this distance is given by the expression:\n$$\\lambda = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2} n \\sigma}$$\nThe factor $\\sqrt{2}$ arises from considering the relative speeds of the colliding molecules. The term $\\sigma$ represents the collisional cross-section. For a hard-sphere molecule of diameter $d$, a collision occurs when the center-to-center distance between two molecules is equal to $d$. The collisional cross-section is therefore the area of a circle with radius $d$:\n$$\\sigma = \\pi d^{2}$$\n\nBy substituting the expressions for number density $n$ and collisional cross-section $\\sigma$ into the formula for $\\lambda$, we derive the mean free path in terms of the macroscopic properties of the gas:\n$$\\lambda = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2} \\left(\\frac{p}{k_{B}T}\\right) (\\pi d^{2})} = \\frac{k_{B}T}{\\sqrt{2} \\pi d^{2} p}$$\nThis is the required expression for the molecular mean free path.\n\nThe Knudsen number, $\\mathrm{Kn}$, is a dimensionless parameter defined as the ratio of the molecular mean free path to a characteristic length scale of the physical system. In this problem, the characteristic length is the channel gap, $H$. Thus,\n$$\\mathrm{Kn} = \\frac{\\lambda}{H}$$\nSubstituting the derived expression for $\\lambda$ yields the expression for the Knudsen number for this specific flow configuration:\n$$\\mathrm{Kn} = \\frac{k_{B}T}{\\sqrt{2} \\pi d^{2} p H}$$\n\nNow, we evaluate this expression numerically using the provided data:\n$T=300\\ \\mathrm{K}$\n$p=5.0\\times 10^{3}\\ \\mathrm{Pa}$\n$H=5.0 \\times 10^{-5}\\ \\mathrm{m}$\n$d=3.70\\times 10^{-10}\\ \\mathrm{m}$\n$k_{B}=1.380649\\times 10^{-23}\\ \\mathrm{J\\,K^{-1}}$\n\nFirst, we calculate the mean free path $\\lambda$:\n$$\\lambda = \\frac{(1.380649\\times 10^{-23}\\ \\mathrm{J\\,K^{-1}})(300\\ \\mathrm{K})}{\\sqrt{2} \\pi (3.70\\times 10^{-10}\\ \\mathrm{m})^{2} (5.0\\times 10^{3}\\ \\mathrm{Pa})} \\approx 1.362 \\times 10^{-6}\\ \\mathrm{m}$$\nThen, we calculate the Knudsen number $\\mathrm{Kn}$:\n$$\\mathrm{Kn} = \\frac{1.362 \\times 10^{-6}\\ \\mathrm{m}}{5.0 \\times 10^{-5}\\ \\mathrm{m}} \\approx 0.02724$$\n\nRounding to three significant figures as required, we obtain:\n$$\\mathrm{Kn} \\approx 0.0272$$\n\nFinally, we must assess whether velocity-slip and temperature-jump boundary conditions are required. This assessment is based on the value of the Knudsen number, which characterizes the degree of rarefaction of the gas flow. The established flow regimes are classified as follows:\n- Continuum flow: $\\mathrm{Kn} \\le 0.001$\n- Slip-flow regime: $0.001 < \\mathrm{Kn} \\le 0.1$\n- Transition flow regime: $0.1 < \\mathrm{Kn} \\le 10$\n- Free-molecular flow regime: $\\mathrm{Kn} > 10$\n\nOur calculated value is $\\mathrm{Kn} \\approx 0.0272$. Since $0.001 < 0.0272 \\le 0.1$, the flow is located in the slip-flow regime. In this regime, the continuum assumption breaks down in the near-wall region (the Knudsen layer), and the no-slip boundary condition is no longer valid. The gas exhibits a finite tangential velocity at the solid surface (velocity slip), and if there is a temperature gradient, the gas temperature at the surface is different from the surface temperature (temperature jump). Therefore, for an accurate prediction of momentum and energy transport, the traditional no-slip/no-jump boundary conditions must be replaced by velocity-slip and temperature-jump boundary conditions. The conclusion is therefore unequivocal: slip and jump conditions are required.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{0.0272}\n$$", "id": "2522729"}, {"introduction": "Once it is determined that a flow is in the slip regime, the next step is to formulate a physically meaningful boundary condition.

This corresponds to a surface that fully \"accommodates\" the incident molecules, meaning that on average they are re-emitted with zero tangential velocity, as if they thermalized with the stationary wall (diffuse reflection).

The gas occupies the half-space $y > 0$. The gas velocity far from the wall is in the $x$-direction, $u_x(y)$. At the wall interface, due to rarefaction effects, the gas has a non-zero slip velocity, $u_s = u_x(y=0)$. The slip length, $b$, is defined by the relation:\n$$u_s = b \\left. \\frac{du_x}{dy} \\right|_{y=0}$$\nwhere $\\left. \\frac{du_x}{dy} \\right|_{y=0}$ is the shear rate at the wall.\n\nFrom kinetic theory, the shear stress at the wall, $\\tau_w$, is the net flux of tangential momentum transferred from the gas to the wall. This can be expressed as the difference between the incident and reflected tangential momentum fluxes. We use a simple model where gas molecules impinging on the wall originate from a distance of approximately one mean free path, $\\lambda$, above the surface. The mean tangential velocity of these incident molecules is therefore the bulk gas velocity at $y=\\lambda$. Using a first-order Taylor expansion for the velocity profile near the wall, this is:\n$$u_x(\\lambda) \\approx u_x(0) + \\lambda \\left. \\frac{du_x}{dy} \\right|_{y=0} = u_s + \\lambda \\left. \\frac{du_x}{dy} \\right|_{y=0}$$\nThe incident mass flux to the wall is given by kinetic theory as $\\frac{1}{4}\\rho\\bar{c}$, where $\\rho$ is the gas density and $\\bar{c}$ is the mean thermal speed of the gas molecules. The incident tangential momentum flux, $P_{in}$, is the product of the mass flux and the mean tangential velocity of incident molecules:\n$$P_{in} = \\left(\\frac{1}{4}\\rho\\bar{c}\\right) \\left(u_s + \\lambda \\left. \\frac{du_x}{dy} \\right|_{y=0}\\right)$$\nThe reflection process is described by the TMAC, $\\sigma_t$. A fraction $\\sigma_t$ of molecules reflects diffusely, re-emitted with zero average tangential velocity (as the wall is stationary). The remaining fraction, $(1-\\sigma_t)$, reflects specularly, conserving their tangential velocity component. The mean tangential velocity of the reflected molecules is thus $(1-\\sigma_t) u_x(\\lambda)$. The reflected tangential momentum flux, $P_{out}$, is:\n$$P_{out} = \\left(\\frac{1}{4}\\rho\\bar{c}\\right) (1-\\sigma_t) \\left(u_s + \\lambda \\left. \\frac{du_x}{dy} \\right|_{y=0}\\right)$$\nThe shear stress at the wall, $\\tau_w$, is the net rate of tangential momentum transfer per unit area:\n$$\\tau_w = P_{in} - P_{out} = \\sigma_t \\left(\\frac{1}{4}\\rho\\bar{c}\\right) \\left(u_s + \\lambda \\left. \\frac{du_x}{dy} \\right|_{y=0}\\right)$$\nIn the continuum limit, the shear stress in the gas adjacent to the wall is given by Newton's law of viscosity, $\\tau_w = \\mu \\left. \\frac{du_x}{dy} \\right|_{y=0}$, where $\\mu$ is the dynamic viscosity. From elementary kinetic theory, the viscosity is related to the mean free path by the expression $\\mu = C \\rho \\bar{c} \\lambda$, where $C$ is a constant of order unity. A common and simple approximation is $C=1/2$, which yields:\n$$\\mu \\approx \\frac{1}{2}\\rho\\bar{c}\\lambda$$\nBy equating the kinetic and continuum expressions for the shear stress at the wall, we establish a condition for the slip velocity:\n$$\\frac{1}{2}\\rho\\bar{c}\\lambda \\left. \\frac{du_x}{dy} \\right|_{y=0} = \\sigma_t \\left(\\frac{1}{4}\\rho\\bar{c}\\right) \\left(u_s + \\lambda \\left. \\frac{du_x}{dy} \\right|_{y=0}\\right)$$\nDividing both sides by $\\frac{1}{4}\\rho\\bar{c}$ simplifies the equation:\n$$2\\lambda \\left. \\frac{du_x}{dy} \\right|_{y=0} = \\sigma_t \\left(u_s + \\lambda \\left. \\frac{du_x}{dy} \\right|_{y=0}\\right)$$\nRearranging to solve for the slip velocity $u_s$:\n$$u_s \\sigma_t = (2-\\sigma_t)\\lambda \\left. \\frac{du_x}{dy} \\right|_{y=0}$$\n$$u_s = \\left(\\frac{2-\\sigma_t}{\\sigma_t}\\right) \\lambda \\left. \\frac{du_x}{dy} \\right|_{y=0}$$\nBy comparing this result with the definition of the slip length, $u_s = b \\left. \\frac{du_x}{dy} \\right|_{y=0}$, we obtain the desired relationship:\n$$b = \\left(\\frac{2-\\sigma_t}{\\sigma_t}\\right)\\lambda$$\nThis is the Maxwell first-order slip length model.\n\nPart 2: Inference of the Tangential Momentum Accommodation Coefficient, $\\sigma_t$\n\nWe must rearrange the derived expression to solve for $\\sigma_t$ in terms of $b$ and $\\lambda$:\n$$\\frac{b}{\\lambda} = \\frac{2-\\sigma_t}{\\sigma_t} = \\frac{2}{\\sigma_t} - 1$$\n$$\\frac{b}{\\lambda} + 1 = \\frac{2}{\\sigma_t}$$\n$$\\sigma_t = \\frac{2}{\\frac{b}{\\lambda} + 1} = \\frac{2\\lambda}{b+\\lambda}$$\nUsing the provided experimental values, $b = 120\\,\\mathrm{nm}$ and $\\lambda = 80\\,\\mathrm{nm}$:\n$$\\sigma_t = \\frac{2 \\times 80}{120 + 80} = \\frac{160}{200} = 0.8$$\n\nPart 3: Estimation of the Standard Uncertainty, $u(\\sigma_t)$\n\nThe standard uncertainty $u(\\sigma_t)$ is found using the first-order Taylor series expansion for uncertainty propagation. For a function $\\sigma_t = f(b, \\lambda)$ with uncorrelated variables $b$ and $\\lambda$, the squared uncertainty is:\n$$u(\\sigma_t)^2 = \\left(\\frac{\\partial \\sigma_t}{\\partial b}\\right)^2 u(b)^2 + \\left(\\frac{\\partial \\sigma_t}{\\partial \\lambda}\\right)^2 u(\\lambda)^2$$\nWe compute the necessary partial derivatives of $\\sigma_t = \\frac{2\\lambda}{b+\\lambda}$:\n$$\\frac{\\partial \\sigma_t}{\\partial b} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial b}\\left(2\\lambda (b+\\lambda)^{-1}\\right) = -2\\lambda(b+\\lambda)^{-2} = -\\frac{2\\lambda}{(b+\\lambda)^2}$$\n$$\\frac{\\partial \\sigma_t}{\\partial \\lambda} = \\frac{(b+\\lambda)(2) - (2\\lambda)(1)}{(b+\\lambda)^2} = \\frac{2b}{(b+\\lambda)^2}$$\nSubstituting these derivatives into the uncertainty formula:\n$$u(\\sigma_t)^2 = \\left(-\\frac{2\\lambda}{(b+\\lambda)^2}\\right)^2 u(b)^2 + \\left(\\frac{2b}{(b+\\lambda)^2}\\right)^2 u(\\lambda)^2$$\n$$u(\\sigma_t)^2 = \\frac{4\\lambda^2}{(b+\\lambda)^4}u(b)^2 + \\frac{4b^2}{(b+\\lambda)^4}u(\\lambda)^2 = \\frac{4}{(b+\\lambda)^4} \\left( \\lambda^2 u(b)^2 + b^2 u(\\lambda)^2 \\right)$$\nThe uncertainty $u(\\sigma_t)$ is the square root of this expression:\n$$u(\\sigma_t) = \\frac{2}{(b+\\lambda)^2} \\sqrt{\\lambda^2 u(b)^2 + b^2 u(\\lambda)^2}$$\nWe now substitute the given values: $b = 120\\,\\mathrm{nm}$, $u(b) = 8\\,\\mathrm{nm}$, $\\lambda = 80\\,\\mathrm{nm}$, and $u(\\lambda) = 4\\,\\mathrm{nm}$.\n$$u(\\sigma_t) = \\frac{2}{(120+80)^2} \\sqrt{(80)^2 (8)^2 + (120)^2 (4)^2}$$\n$$u(\\sigma_t) = \\frac{2}{(200)^2} \\sqrt{(6400)(64) + (14400)(16)}$$\n$$u(\\sigma_t) = \\frac{2}{40000} \\sqrt{409600 + 230400} = \\frac{2}{40000} \\sqrt{640000}$$\n$$u(\\sigma_t) = \\frac{2}{40000} \\times 800 = \\frac{1600}{40000} = \\frac{16}{400} = \\frac{1}{25} = 0.04$$\nThe problem requires the final answer to be reported to three significant figures.\nThus, $\\sigma_t = 0.800$ and $u(\\sigma_t) = 0.0400$.\n\nThe final result is reported as the row matrix $[\\sigma_t, u(\\sigma_t)]$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n0.800 & 0.0400\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "2522738"}]}
