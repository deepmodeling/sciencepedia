An ultrafast optical pulse deposits energy predominantly into the conduction electrons, producing a transiently hot electron distribution that can be described by the Two-Temperature Model (TTM), in which the electron and lattice subsystems are characterized by temperatures $T_{e}$ and $T_{l}$ and volumetric heat capacities $C_{e}(T_{e})$ and $C_{l}(T_{l})$, respectively.

It is based on fundamental principles of condensed matter physics, namely the free-electron model (Sommerfeld theory) and the Debye model of solids. All necessary data and constants are provided, and there are no internal contradictions or ambiguities. The problem is a standard exercise in the application of these models to the two-temperature scenario in metals. Therefore, the problem is valid and a solution will be provided.\n\nThe problem is solved in three parts as requested.\n\nPart 1: Derivation of the electron volumetric heat capacity $C_{e}(T_{e})$.\n\nThe internal energy per unit volume, $u_{e}$, of a free electron gas is given by the integral of the energy $E$ multiplied by the density of states per unit volume, $g_{v}(E)$, and the Fermi-Dirac distribution function, $f(E, T_{e})$:\n$$u_{e}(T_{e}) = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} E g_{v}(E) f(E, T_{e}) dE$$\nwhere $f(E, T_{e}) = (\\exp((E - \\mu)/k_{B}T_{e}) + 1)^{-1}$ and $\\mu$ is the chemical potential. The volumetric heat capacity is defined as $C_{e}(T_{e}) = (\\frac{\\partial u_{e}}{\\partial T_{e}})_{V}$.\n\nFor a degenerate Fermi gas, where the thermal energy is much smaller than the Fermi energy ($k_{B}T_{e} \\ll E_{F}$), we can use the Sommerfeld expansion for the internal energy. The change in internal energy per unit volume from absolute zero is given by:\n$$\\Delta u_{e}(T_{e}) = u_{e}(T_{e}) - u_{e}(0) \\approx \\frac{\\pi^{2}}{6} g_{v}(E_{F}) (k_{B}T_{e})^{2}$$\nwhere $g_{v}(E_{F})$ is the density of states per unit volume at the Fermi energy $E_{F}$.\n\nFor a 3D free electron gas, the density of states per unit volume is $g_{v}(E) = \\frac{1}{2\\pi^{2}} (\\frac{2m_{e}}{\\hbar^{2}})^{3/2} E^{1/2}$. The Fermi energy $E_{F}$ is related to the electron number density $n_{e}$ by $E_{F} = \\frac{\\hbar^{2}}{2m_{e}} (3\\pi^{2}n_{e})^{2/3}$. The total number of electrons per unit volume is $n_{e} = \\int_{0}^{E_{F}} g_{v}(E) dE = \\frac{1}{3\\pi^{2}} (\\frac{2m_{e}E_{F}}{\\hbar^{2}})^{3/2}$. From these relations, the density of states at the Fermi energy can be expressed simply in terms of $n_{e}$ and $E_{F}$:\n$$g_{v}(E_{F}) = \\frac{3n_{e}}{2E_{F}}$$\nSubstituting this expression for $g_{v}(E_{F})$ into the equation for $\\Delta u_{e}(T_{e})$:\n$$\\Delta u_{e}(T_{e}) \\approx \\frac{\\pi^{2}}{6} \\left(\\frac{3n_{e}}{2E_{F}}\\right) (k_{B}T_{e})^{2} = \\frac{\\pi^{2}n_{e}k_{B}^{2}}{4E_{F}} T_{e}^{2}$$\nThe electron volumetric heat capacity is then found by differentiating with respect to $T_{e}$:\n$$C_{e}(T_{e}) = \\frac{\\partial(\\Delta u_{e})}{\\partial T_{e}} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial T_{e}} \\left(\\frac{\\pi^{2}n_{e}k_{B}^{2}}{4E_{F}} T_{e}^{2}\\right) = \\frac{\\pi^{2}n_{e}k_{B}^{2}}{2E_{F}} T_{e}$$\nThis is the required expression for the electron heat capacity, which is linear in the electron temperature $T_{e}$.\n\nPart 2: Derivation of the lattice volumetric heat capacity $C_{l}(T_{l})$.\n\nThe lattice heat capacity is described by the Debye model. In the high-temperature limit, where the thermal energy is much larger than the energy of typical phonons ($T_{l} \\gg \\Theta_{D}$), the heat capacity of the lattice approaches the classical limit predicted by the Law of Dulong-Petit. According to this law, each of the $3N$ vibrational modes of a solid containing $N$ atoms has an average energy of $k_{B}T_{l}$ due to equipartition. The total internal energy of the lattice is thus $U_{l} \\approx 3Nk_{B}T_{l}$.\nThe heat capacity at constant volume is $C_{V,l} = (\\frac{\\partial U_{l}}{\\partial T_{l}})_{V} = 3Nk_{B}$.\n\nThe volumetric heat capacity $C_{l}$ is obtained by dividing by the volume $V$:\n$$C_{l} = \\frac{3Nk_{B}}{V} = 3n_{a}k_{B}$$\nwhere $n_{a} = N/V$ is the number density of atoms in the solid.\n\nThe problem asks to justify the use of this high-temperature limit for gold at $T_{l} \\approx 300\\ \\text{K}$. The Debye temperature for gold is given as $\\Theta_{D} = 170\\ \\text{K}$. The ratio $T_{l}/\\Theta_{D} = 300/170 \\approx 1.76$. Since $T_{l} > \\Theta_{D}$, the system is in a regime where the Dulong-Petit law is a reasonable approximation. At $T = \\Theta_{D}$, the Debye model predicts a heat capacity that is approximately $96\\%$ of the Dulong-Petit limit $3n_{a}k_{B}$. At $T_l = 1.76\\,\\Theta_D$, the value is even closer to the limit. Thus, we can consider $C_{l}$ to be constant and equal to $3n_{a}k_{B}$ around $300\\ \\text{K}$.\n\nPart 3: Calculation of the crossover electron temperature $T_{e}^{\\ast}$.\n\nThe crossover temperature $T_{e}^{\\ast}$ is defined by the condition $C_{e}(T_{e}^{\\ast}) = C_{l}(T_{l}=300\\ \\text{K})$. Using the expressions derived above:\n$$\\frac{\\pi^{2}n_{e}k_{B}^{2}}{2E_{F}} T_{e}^{\\ast} = 3n_{a}k_{B}$$\nFor gold, a monovalent metal ($z=1$), each atom contributes one conduction electron. Therefore, the electron number density $n_{e}$ is equal to the atom number density $n_{a}$. We can cancel $n_{a}$ (as $n_e=n_a$) and one factor of $k_{B}$ from both sides:\n$$\\frac{\\pi^{2}k_{B}}{2E_{F}} T_{e}^{\\ast} = 3$$\nSolving for $T_{e}^{\\ast}$:\n$$T_{e}^{\\ast} = \\frac{6E_{F}}{\\pi^{2}k_{B}}$$\nTo calculate $T_{e}^{\\ast}$, we first need to find the Fermi energy $E_{F}$ for gold. First, we compute the atom density $n_{a}$:\n$$n_{a} = \\frac{\\rho N_{A}}{M} = \\frac{(19.3\\ \\text{g/cm}^{3}) \\times (10^{6}\\ \\text{cm}^{3}/\\text{m}^{3}) \\times (6.02214076 \\times 10^{23}\\ \\text{mol}^{-1})}{196.97\\ \\text{g/mol}} = 5.9015 \\times 10^{28}\\ \\text{m}^{-3}$$\nSince $n_{e} = n_{a}$ for gold, we use this value to calculate $E_{F}$:\n$$E_{F} = \\frac{\\hbar^{2}}{2m_{e}} (3\\pi^{2}n_{e})^{2/3}$$\n$$E_{F} = \\frac{(1.054571817 \\times 10^{-34}\\ \\text{J s})^{2}}{2(9.1093837015 \\times 10^{-31}\\ \\text{kg})} [3\\pi^{2}(5.9015 \\times 10^{28}\\ \\text{m}^{-3})]^{2/3}$$\n$$E_{F} \\approx 8.8522 \\times 10^{-19}\\ \\text{J}$$\nNow, we can compute $T_{e}^{\\ast}$:\n$$T_{e}^{\\ast} = \\frac{6 \\times (8.8522 \\times 10^{-19}\\ \\text{J})}{\\pi^{2} \\times (1.380649 \\times 10^{-23}\\ \\text{J/K})} \\approx 38978\\ \\text{K}$$\nRounding to three significant figures, we get $T_{e}^{\\ast} = 3.90 \\times 10^{4}\\ \\text{K}$.\n\nQualitative Discussion:\nThe fact that at typical temperatures $C_{e} \\ll C_{l}$ is central to the two-temperature dynamics. After an ultrafast laser pulse, energy is almost instantaneously absorbed by the electrons. Because their heat capacity is so small, their temperature $T_e$ can rise to many thousands of kelvin while the lattice temperature $T_l$ remains near the initial temperature. The energy then equilibrates between the electron and lattice subsystems on a timescale governed by the electron-phonon coupling strength.\nThe calculated crossover temperature $T_{e}^{\\ast} \\approx 39000\\ \\text{K}$ is exceptionally high. Gold melts at $1337\\ \\text{K}$ and boils at $3129\\ \\text{K}$. Long before the electron temperature could reach $T_{e}^{\\ast}$, the energy transferred to the lattice would be sufficient to melt, vaporize, and even ionize the material, completely destroying the solid-state structure. Therefore, in experiments on gold thin films that do not result in material ablation or plasma formation, this crossover condition is never reached. The inequality $C_{e}(T_{e}) < C_{l}$ holds throughout the entire relevant temperature range for the solid phase.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{3.90 \\times 10^{4}}$$", "id": "2481650"}, {"introduction": "A key skill in theoretical modeling is identifying which physical processes are dominant and which can be neglected under specific conditions.

Substituting this into the BTE gives:\n$$\n-v_z g_{1,\\text{bulk}} \\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial z} + \\frac{g_{1,\\text{bulk}}(1-F)}{\\tau} = \\frac{g_{1,\\text{bulk}}}{\\tau} \\implies v_z \\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial z} + \\frac{F}{\\tau} = 0\n$$\nThe solution is $F(z, \\mathbf{v}) = C(\\mathbf{v}) \\exp(-z/(v_z\\tau))$. We use different forms for electrons moving toward $z=L$ ($v_z > 0$) versus toward $z=0$ ($v_z < 0$):\nLet $u = |v_z|$.\nFor $v_z = u > 0$, we write $F^+(z) = A \\exp(-z/(u\\tau))$.\nFor $v_z = -u < 0$, we write $F^-(z) = B \\exp((z-L)/(u\\tau))$ so that the perturbation decays away from the surface of last scattering.\n\nThe boundary conditions link the distributions for incident and scattered electrons at each surface:\nAt $z=0$: $g_1(0, v_z > 0) = p \\, g_1(0, v_z < 0)$. This gives $g_{1,\\text{bulk}}(1 - F^+(0)) = p \\, g_{1,\\text{bulk}}(1 - F^-(0))$.\nAt $z=L$: $g_1(L, v_z < 0) = p \\, g_1(L, v_z > 0)$. This gives $g_{1,\\text{bulk}}(1 - F^-(L)) = p \\, g_{1,\\text{bulk}}(1 - F^+(L))$.\n\nSubstituting the solutions for $F^\\pm$:\n$1 - A = p(1 - B \\exp(-L/(u\\tau)))$.\n$1 - B = p(1 - A \\exp(-L/(u\\tau)))$.\nBy symmetry, $A=B$. Solving for $A$:\n$1 - A = p(1 - A \\exp(-L/(u\\tau))) \\implies 1-p = A(1 - p \\exp(-L/(u\\tau)))$.\nLet $\\alpha = L/(u\\tau) = L/(\\lambda|\\cos\\theta|)$, where $\\theta$ is the angle between $\\mathbf{v}$ and the $z$-axis.\n$$\nA = \\frac{1-p}{1-p\\exp(-\\alpha)}\n$$\nSo, $F^+(z) = A \\exp(-z/(u\\tau))$ and $F^-(z) = A \\exp((z-L)/(u\\tau))$.\n\n**Step 5: Calculation of the Film Conductivity**\nThe film conductivity is the spatial average of the local conductivity $\\sigma(z)$:\n$$\n\\sigma^{\\text{film}} = \\frac{1}{L} \\int_0^L \\sigma(z) dz\n$$\nThe ratio $\\sigma(z)/\\sigma_{\\text{bulk}}$ is given by $1-\\langle F(z,\\mathbf{v})\\rangle_{FS}$, where the average is over the Fermi surface. The film conductivity ratio is then:\n$f = 1 - \\frac{1}{L} \\int_0^L \\langle F(z,\\mathbf{v})\\rangle_{FS} dz = 1 - \\langle \\bar{F}(\\mathbf{v})\\rangle_{FS}$, where $\\bar{F}$ is the spatial average of $F$.\nThe spatial average $\\bar{F}$ is the same for both $v_z>0$ and $v_z<0$:\n$$\n\\bar{F}(u) = \\frac{1}{L} \\int_0^L A \\exp(-z/(u\\tau)) dz = A \\frac{u\\tau}{L}(1 - \\exp(-L/(u\\tau))) = \\frac{A}{\\alpha}(1 - \\exp(-\\alpha))\n$$\nSubstituting for $A$:\n$$\n\\bar{F}(u) = \\frac{1-p}{1-p\\exp(-\\alpha)} \\frac{1 - \\exp(-\\alpha)}{\\alpha}\n$$\nThe reduction factor $f$ is obtained by averaging $\\bar{F}$ over the Fermi surface, weighted by $v_x^2$:\n$$\nf = 1 - \\frac{\\langle v_x^2 \\bar{F}(|v_z|) \\rangle_{FS}}{\\langle v_x^2 \\rangle_{FS}}\n$$\nUsing spherical coordinates where $v_x = v_F \\sin\\theta\\cos\\phi$ and $v_z = v_F \\cos\\theta$:\n$\\langle v_x^2 \\rangle_{FS} = v_F^2/3$.\n$\\langle v_x^2 \\bar{F} \\rangle_{FS} = \\frac{1}{4\\pi} \\int_0^{2\\pi} d\\phi \\int_0^\\pi d\\theta \\sin\\theta (v_F\\sin\\theta\\cos\\phi)^2 \\bar{F}(v_F|\\cos\\theta|)$.\nThe integral over $\\phi$ gives $\\pi$.\n$\\langle v_x^2 \\bar{F} \\rangle_{FS} = \\frac{v_F^2}{4} \\int_0^\\pi \\sin^3\\theta \\, \\bar{F}(v_F|\\cos\\theta|) d\\theta = \\frac{v_F^2}{2} \\int_0^{\\pi/2} \\sin^3\\theta \\, \\bar{F}(v_F\\cos\\theta) d\\theta$.\nThe reduction term is $\\frac{\\langle v_x^2 \\bar{F} \\rangle}{\\langle v_x^2 \\rangle} = \\frac{3}{2} \\int_0^{\\pi/2} \\sin^3\\theta \\, \\bar{F}(v_F\\cos\\theta) d\\theta$.\nLet $u_c = \\cos\\theta$. The integral becomes $\\frac{3}{2} \\int_0^1 (1-u_c^2) \\bar{F}(v_F u_c) du_c$.\nLet $\\delta = L/\\lambda = L/(v_F\\tau)$. Then $\\alpha = L/(v_F u_c \\tau) = \\delta/u_c$.\nThe reduction term is $\\frac{3}{2} \\int_0^1 (1-u_c^2) \\frac{1-p}{1-p\\exp(-\\delta/u_c)} \\frac{u_c(1 - \\exp(-\\delta/u_c))}{\\delta} du_c$.\nTo obtain the standard form, we change the integration variable to $t=1/u_c$, so $du_c=-dt/t^2$.\n$$\n\\frac{3(1-p)}{2\\delta} \\int_1^\\infty \\left(1-\\frac{1}{t^2}\\right) t \\frac{1-\\exp(-\\delta t)}{1-p\\exp(-\\delta t)} \\frac{dt}{t^2} = \\frac{3(1-p)}{2\\delta} \\int_1^\\infty \\left(\\frac{1}{t^3}-\\frac{1}{t^5}\\right) \\frac{1-e^{-\\delta t}}{1-pe^{-\\delta t}} dt\n$$\nThe Fuchs-Sondheimer reduction factor is therefore:\n$$\nf\\left(p, \\frac{\\lambda}{L}\\right) = 1 - \\frac{3(1-p)}{2(L/\\lambda)} \\int_1^\\infty \\left(\\frac{1}{t^3}-\\frac{1}{t^5}\\right) \\frac{1 - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{L}{\\lambda}t\\right)}{1 - p\\exp\\left(-\\frac{L}{\\lambda}t\\right)} dt\n$$\nThis integral expression is the final result.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{f\\left(p,\\frac{\\lambda}{L}\\right) = 1 - \\frac{3(1-p)}{2(L/\\lambda)} \\int_1^\\infty \\left(\\frac{1}{t^3} - \\frac{1}{t^5}\\right) \\frac{1 - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{L}{\\lambda}t\\right)}{1 - p\\exp\\left(-\\frac{L}{\\lambda}t\\right)} dt}$$", "id": "2481609"}]}
