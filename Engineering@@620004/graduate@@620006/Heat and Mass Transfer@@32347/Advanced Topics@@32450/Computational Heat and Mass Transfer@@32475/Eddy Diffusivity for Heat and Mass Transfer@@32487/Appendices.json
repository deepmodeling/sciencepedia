We may therefore proceed with the solution.\n\nThe objective is to derive an expression relating the Sherwood number, $\\mathrm{Sh}_{D}$, to the Nusselt number, $\\mathrm{Nu}_{D}$, Prandtl number, $\\mathrm{Pr}$, and Schmidt number, $\\mathrm{Sc}$, and then to compute its value. This is accomplished by invoking the analogy between heat and mass transfer in turbulent flow.\n\nThe fundamental definitions for the Stanton numbers for heat and mass transfer are:\nThe Stanton number for heat transfer, $\\mathrm{St}_{h}$, is defined as the ratio of the heat transfer coefficient, $h$, to the heat capacity rate of the fluid per unit area:\n$$ \\mathrm{St}_{h} = \\frac{h}{\\rho u_b c_p} $$\nwhere $\\rho$ is the fluid density, $u_b$ is the bulk velocity, and $c_p$ is the specific heat at constant pressure.

The Chilton-Colburn analogy is generally applicable for:\n1.  Fully developed turbulent flow, typically for $\\mathrm{Re}_{D} > 10^{4}$.\n2.  Smooth conduits.\n3.

It presents a standard, albeit challenging, problem in computational turbulence modeling for heat transfer. All necessary physical principles, model equations, and parameters are provided to formulate and solve for the requested quantities. The core of the problem lies in the derivation of a physically-reasoned algebraic model for the turbulent Prandtl number, a task for which sufficient constraints and guiding principles are provided. The problem is therefore deemed **valid**.\n\nThe solution proceeds in two main parts. First, an algebraic model for the turbulent Prandtl number, $Pr_t(y)$, is derived based on the provided physical principles. Second, a step-by-step numerical procedure is outlined to compute the required deliverables for the specified test cases.\n\n### Derivation of the Turbulent Prandtl Number Model\n\nThe objective is to derive an algebraic expression for $Pr_t(y)$ that depends on the local turbulent Péclet number, $Pe_t(y) = \\nu_t(y)/\\alpha$, and is consistent with the $k-\\epsilon$ local equilibrium framework. The model must recover the constant asymptotic value $Pr_{t,\\infty}$ for high $Pe_t$ and reflect the suppression of turbulent scalar transport for low $Pe_t$.\n\nThe turbulent Prandtl number is fundamentally a ratio of the efficiency of turbulent transport of momentum to that of a scalar (heat). This can be related to the ratio of the characteristic timescales of the velocity and scalar fields. Let $\\tau_t$ be the mechanical turbulent timescale and $\\tau_\\theta$ be the scalar turbulent timescale. A common modeling assumption is:\n$$ Pr_t \\propto \\frac{\\tau_t}{\\tau_\\theta} $$\nIn the $k-\\epsilon$ model under local equilibrium ($P_k=\\epsilon$), the mechanical timescale is given by $\\tau_t = k/\\epsilon$. Combining $P_k = \\nu_t S^2$ with $\\nu_t = C_\\mu k^2/\\epsilon$ yields:\n$$ \\tau_t = \\frac{k}{\\epsilon} = \\frac{k}{\\nu_t S^2} = \\frac{k}{(C_\\mu k^2/\\epsilon) S^2} = \\frac{\\epsilon}{C_\\mu k S^2} = \\frac{1}{C_\\mu \\tau_t S^2} \\implies \\tau_t = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{C_\\mu} S} $$\nThe scalar timescale, $\\tau_\\theta$, represents the lifetime of a turbulent scalar structure. This lifetime is limited by two main processes: distortion and tearing by the turbulent velocity field (acting over timescale $\\tau_{\\theta,t}$) and dissipation by molecular diffusion (acting over timescale $\\tau_{mol}$). The effective decay rate, $1/\\tau_\\theta$, can be modeled as the sum of the rates of these two processes:\n$$ \\frac{1}{\\tau_\\theta} \\approx \\frac{1}{\\tau_{\\theta,t}} + \\frac{1}{\\tau_{mol}} $$\nThe purely turbulent scalar decay rate, $1/\\tau_{\\theta,t}$, is intrinsically linked to the mechanical turnover rate, $1/\\tau_t$. For $Pe_t \\to \\infty$, where molecular effects on the transport process are negligible, $Pr_t \\to Pr_{t,\\infty}$. In this limit, $\\tau_\\theta \\to \\tau_{\\theta,t}$, and we can model the relationship as $Pr_{t,\\infty} \\propto \\tau_t/\\tau_{\\theta,t}$.\nThe molecular diffusion rate, $1/\\tau_{mol}$, depends on the molecular diffusivity $\\alpha$ and a characteristic length scale of the scalar-containing eddies, $L_\\theta$. Thus, $1/\\tau_{mol} \\sim \\alpha/L_\\theta^2$. We can approximate $L_\\theta$ with the turbulent momentum transport length scale, $L_t \\sim \\sqrt{\\nu_t \\tau_t}$. This gives:\n$$ \\frac{1}{\\tau_{mol}} \\sim \\frac{\\alpha}{\\nu_t \\tau_t} = \\frac{1}{\\tau_t \\cdot Pe_t} $$\nCombining the rates, assuming simple proportionality, we write:\n$$ \\frac{1}{\\tau_\\theta} \\sim \\frac{1}{\\tau_t Pr_{t,\\infty}} + \\frac{C}{\\tau_t Pe_t} = \\frac{1}{\\tau_t} \\left( \\frac{1}{Pr_{t,\\infty}} + \\frac{C}{Pe_t} \\right) $$\nThis relates the scalar timescale to the mechanical timescale and the Péclet number. To obtain the simplest possible algebraic model that adheres to the problem's constraints without introducing new empirical constants (like $C$), we postulate a minimal form for the timescale ratio that has the correct behavior. Let us model the ratio directly:\n$$ \\frac{\\tau_t}{\\tau_\\theta} \\approx \\left(\\frac{\\tau_t}{\\tau_\\theta}\\right)_{\\infty} \\left( 1 + \\frac{1}{Pe_t} \\right) $$\nAssuming $Pr_t$ is directly proportional to this ratio, $Pr_t = C' (\\tau_t/\\tau_\\theta)$, and ensuring the correct high-$Pe_t$ limit ($Pr_t \\to Pr_{t,\\infty}$), we set $C' (\\tau_t/\\tau_\\theta)_{\\infty} = Pr_{t,\\infty}$, leading to the model:\n$$ Pr_t(y) = Pr_{t, \\infty} \\left(1 + \\frac{1}{Pe_t(y)}\\right) = Pr_{t, \\infty} \\left(1 + \\frac{\\alpha}{\\nu_t(y)}\\right) $$\nThis model satisfies the requirements: it yields $Pr_t \\to Pr_{t, \\infty}$ as $Pe_t \\to \\infty$, and $Pr_t$ increases as $Pe_t \\to 0$, reflecting the suppression of scalar transport. It is an algebraic function of local quantities and known constants.\n\n### Computational Methodology\n\nThe problem is solved numerically on a one-dimensional grid $y_i$ for $i=0, \\ldots, N-1$ over the domain $[0, y_{\\max}]$.\n\n**Step 1: Compute Primary Variables**\nFirst, the wall-normal coordinate grid $y$ and the corresponding dimensionless wall distance $y^+$ are established:\n$$ y_i = i \\cdot \\frac{y_{\\max}}{N-1}, \\quad y_i^+ = \\frac{y_i u_\\tau}{\\nu} $$\n\n**Step 2: Compute Mean Strain Rate Profile, $S(y)$**\nThe mean strain rate $S = dU/dy$ is obtained from the constant total shear relation $\\rho u_\\tau^2 = \\rho(\\nu + \\nu_t)S$ and the mixing-length model for eddy viscosity $\\nu_t = \\ell_m^2 S$. This yields a quadratic equation for $S(y)$:\n$$ \\ell_m(y)^2 S^2 + \\nu S - u_\\tau^2 = 0 $$\nwhere the mixing length $\\ell_m(y)$ is given by the van Driest damped model:\n$$ \\ell_m(y) = \\kappa y \\left(1 - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{y^+}{A^+}\\right)\\right) $$\nThe positive root for $S(y)$ is:\n$$ S(y) = \\frac{-\\nu + \\sqrt{\\nu^2 + 4 \\ell_m(y)^2 u_\\tau^2}}{2 \\ell_m(y)^2} $$\nAt the wall ($y=0$), $\\ell_m=0$, and the limiting behavior is $S(0) = u_\\tau^2/\\nu$. This value is used for the grid point $y_0 = 0$ to avoid singularity.\n\n**Step 3: Compute Turbulent Viscosity, $\\nu_t(y)$**\nWith $S(y)$ and $\\ell_m(y)$ known, the eddy viscosity profile is computed directly:\n$$ \\nu_t(y) = \\ell_m(y)^2 S(y) $$\nAt the wall, $\\nu_t(0)=0$.\n\n**Step 4: Compute Thermal Properties, $Pr_t(y)$ and $\\alpha_t(y)$**\nFor each molecular Prandtl number $Pr$, the molecular thermal diffusivity is $\\alpha=\\nu/Pr$. Using the derived model for $Pr_t(y)$, we first compute the turbulent thermal diffusivity profile $\\alpha_t(y)$. To avoid numerical issues at $y=0$ where $\\nu_t=0$ and the direct formula for $Pr_t$ diverges, we use a rearranged, well-behaved expression for $\\alpha_t$:\n$$ \\alpha_t(y) = \\frac{\\nu_t(y)}{Pr_t(y)} = \\frac{\\nu_t(y)}{Pr_{t, \\infty} \\left(1 + \\alpha/\\nu_t(y)\\right)} = \\frac{\\nu_t(y)^2}{Pr_{t, \\infty} \\left(\\nu_t(y) + \\alpha\\right)} $$\nThis formula correctly gives $\\alpha_t(0)=0$. With $\\alpha_t(y)$ computed, $Pr_t(y)$ can be found for $y>0$ where $\\nu_t > 0$ for use in the log-layer average calculation.\n\n**Step 5: Compute Deliverables**\nFor each case, the two required quantities are computed.\n1.  **Inner Stanton Number, $St_\\tau$**: The integral in the denominator of $St_\\tau$ is evaluated numerically using the trapezoidal rule over the grid:\n    $$ I = \\int_{0}^{y_{\\max}} \\frac{dy}{\\alpha + \\alpha_t(y)} \\approx \\sum_{i=0}^{N-2} \\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\frac{1}{\\alpha+\\alpha_t(y_i)} + \\frac{1}{\\alpha+\\alpha_t(y_{i+1})}\\right)(y_{i+1}-y_i) $$\n    The Stanton number is then:\n    $$ St_\\tau = \\left[ u_\\tau I \\right]^{-1} $$\n2.  **Log-Layer Average Turbulent Prandtl Number, $\\overline{Pr_t}^{(30,300)}$**: A boolean mask is used to identify grid points $y_i$ for which $30 \\le y_i^+ \\le 300$. The average of the $Pr_t(y_i)$ values at these points is then computed:\n    $$ \\overline{Pr_t}^{(30,300)} = \\frac{1}{N_{L}} \\sum_{i \\, : \\, 30 \\le y_i^+ \\le 300} Pr_t(y_i) $$\n    where $N_L$ is the number of such points.\n\nThis procedure is implemented for each of the three specified molecular Prandtl numbers to generate the final results.", "answer": "```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Main function to solve the turbulent heat transfer problem for three cases.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # --- Common Parameters and Constants ---\n    u_tau = 0.5  # m/s\n    nu = 1.5e-5  # m^2/s\n    y_max = 0.05  # m\n    N = 4000\n    # Model constants\n    kappa = 0.41\n    A_plus = 26.0\n    Pr_t_inf = 0.85\n    # The problem provides C_mu=0.09, which is used implicitly in the k-epsilon\n    # framework that justifies the time scale arguments, but is not explicitly\n    # needed for the chosen algebraic model's final computational steps.\n    # The same applies to rho and c_p.\n\n    test_cases = [\n        0.71,   # Case A: air-like\n        7.0,    # Case B: water-like\n        0.025,  # Case C: liquid-metal-like\n    ]\n\n    results = []\n\n    # One-dimensional grid and wall units\n    y = np.linspace(0, y_max, N)\n    y_plus = y * u_tau / nu\n\n    for Pr in test_cases:\n        # --- Perform calculations for a single case ---\n\n        # 1.
