The setup is well-posed, describing a standard boundary value problem with sufficient information for a unique solution. All terms are objective and precisely defined. No scientific or logical flaws are present, and the problem is a standard, non-trivial exercise in numerical analysis for partial differential equations. The problem is therefore deemed **valid**.\n\n**Part 1: Derivation of the Linear System**\n\nThe problem demands a derivation starting from the conservation law on a control volume. The governing equation is the statement of conservation of energy. We integrate this equation over a control volume $V_i = [x_i - h/2, x_i + h/2]$ centered around an interior node $x_i$, where $i \\in \\{1, 2, \\ldots, N\\}$.\n$$\n-\\int_{x_i - h/2}^{x_i + h/2} \\frac{d}{dx}\\left(k\\,\\frac{dT}{dx}\\right) dx = 0\n$$\nApplying the fundamental theorem of calculus gives:\n$$\n-\\left[k\\,\\frac{dT}{dx}\\right]_{x_i - h/2}^{x_i + h/2} = 0\n$$\nLet $q = -k\\,\\frac{dT}{dx}$ be the heat flux according to Fourier's law. The equation becomes a balance of fluxes at the control volume faces:\n$$\nq(x_i + h/2) - q(x_i - h/2) = 0\n$$\nWe approximate the fluxes at the cell faces using a second-order central difference approximation for the temperature gradient. The temperature at the face $x_i+h/2$ is halfway between nodes $x_i$ and $x_i+1$. The gradient is thus:\n$$\n\\left.\\frac{dT}{dx}\\right|_{x_i + h/2} \\approx \\frac{T(x_{i+1}) - T(x_i)}{h} = \\frac{T_{i+1} - T_i}{h}\n$$\nSimilarly, at the face $x_i-h/2$:\n$$\n\\left.\\frac{dT}{dx}\\right|_{x_i - h/2} \\approx \\frac{T(x_i) - T(x_{i-1})}{h} = \\frac{T_i - T_{i-1}}{h}\n$$\nSubstituting these approximations into the flux balance, and using the fact that $k$ is constant:\n$$\n\\left(-k\\,\\frac{T_{i+1} - T_i}{h}\\right) - \\left(-k\\,\\frac{T_i - T_{i-1}}{h}\\right) = 0\n$$\nMultiplying by $-h/k$ (since $h \\neq 0$ and $k \\neq 0$), we obtain the algebraic equation for any interior node $i \\in \\{1, 2, \\ldots, N\\}$:\n$$\n(T_{i+1} - T_i) - (T_i - T_{i-1}) = 0\n$$\n$$\n-T_{i-1} + 2T_i - T_{i+1} = 0\n$$\nThis set of equations must be adapted for the boundary nodes. Let the vector of unknown temperatures be $\\mathbf{T} = [T_1, T_2, \\ldots, T_N]^T$.\nFor the first interior node, $i=1$:\n$$\n-T_0 + 2T_1 - T_2 = 0\n$$\nUsing the boundary condition $T_0 = T(0) = T_{\\ell}$, we have:\n$$\n2T_1 - T_2 = T_{\\ell}\n$$\nFor the last interior node, $i=N$:\n$$\n-T_{N-1} + 2T_N - T_{N+1} = 0\n$$\nUsing the boundary condition $T_{N+1} = T(L) = T_r$, we have:\n$$\n-T_{N-1} + 2T_N = T_r\n$$\nThe complete system of $N$ linear equations, $A\\mathbf{T} = \\mathbf{b}$, can now be written. The matrix $A$ is an $N \\times N$ matrix with entries:\n$$\nA_{ij} =\n\\begin{cases}\n2 & \\text{if } i=j \\\\\n-1 & \\text{if } |i-j|=1 \\\\\n0 & \\text{otherwise}\n\\end{cases}\n$$\nThe right-hand side vector $\\mathbf{b}$ is an $N$-dimensional vector with entries:\n$$\nb_i =\n\\begin{cases}\nT_{\\ell} & \\text{if } i=1 \\\\\nT_r & \\text{if } i=N \\\\\n0 & \\text{otherwise (for } i \\in \\{2, \\ldots, N-1\\})\n\\end{cases}\n$$\nThis completes the first part of the problem.\n\n**Part 2: Spectral Radius of the Gauss-Seidel Iteration Matrix**\n\nThe Gauss-Seidel method is defined by the splitting $A = D - L - U$, where $D$ is the diagonal of $A$, $-L$ is the strict lower triangular part of $A$, and $-U$ is the strict upper triangular part of $A$. The iteration matrix is $G_{GS} = (D-L)^{-1}U$.\n$D = 2I$, where $I$ is the $N \\times N$ identity matrix.\n$L$ is a matrix with entries $L_{i,i-1}=1$ for $i=2, \\dots, N$ and zeros elsewhere.\n$U$ is a matrix with entries $U_{i,i+1}=1$ for $i=1, \\dots, N-1$ and zeros elsewhere.\n\nThe spectral radius $\\rho(G_{GS})$ is the maximum modulus of the eigenvalues of $G_{GS}$. Let $\\lambda$ be an eigenvalue of $G_{GS}$ and $\\mathbf{v}$ be the corresponding eigenvector.\n$$\nG_{GS}\\mathbf{v} = \\lambda\\mathbf{v} \\implies (D-L)^{-1}U\\mathbf{v} = \\lambda\\mathbf{v}\n$$\nMultiplying by $(D-L)$, we get:\n$$\nU\\mathbf{v} = \\lambda(D-L)\\mathbf{v}\n$$\nWe write this equation for the $k$-th component of the eigenvector $\\mathbf{v} = [v_1, v_2, \\ldots, v_N]^T$, for $k=1, \\ldots, N$:\n$$\nv_{k+1} = \\lambda(2v_k - v_{k-1})\n$$\nwhere we must define $v_0$ and $v_{N+1}$. From the matrix structure, the first row ($k=1$) of $U\\mathbf{v}$ is $v_2$, and the first row of $\\lambda(D-L)\\mathbf{v}$ is $\\lambda(2v_1)$. Thus, $v_2 = \\lambda(2v_1)$. This is consistent with the general recurrence if we set $v_0=0$.\nThe last row ($k=N$) of $U\\mathbf{v}$ is $0$. The last row of $\\lambda(D-L)\\mathbf{v}$ is $\\lambda(2v_N - v_{N-1})$. Thus, $0 = \\lambda(2v_N - v_{N-1})$. Assuming we are interested in non-zero eigenvalues $\\lambda$, this implies $2v_N - v_{N-1} = 0$.\n\nWe now have a homogeneous linear recurrence relation:\n$$\nv_{k+1} - 2\\lambda v_k + \\lambda v_{k-1} = 0, \\quad \\text{for } k=1, \\ldots, N\n$$\nsubject to the conditions $v_0=0$ and another condition derived from the last row. Let's examine the recurrence for $k=N$:\n$$\nv_{N+1} - 2\\lambda v_N + \\lambda v_{N-1} = 0\n$$\nSubstituting $v_{N-1} = 2v_N$ (from the last row equation) into this relation gives:\n$$\nv_{N+1} - 2\\lambda v_N + \\lambda(2v_N) = 0 \\implies v_{N+1} = 0\n$$\nSo, the eigenvector components must satisfy the recurrence relation with homogeneous boundary conditions $v_0=0$ and $v_{N+1}=0$. This defines a discrete boundary value problem.\n\nTo solve the recurrence, we introduce a substitution. Let $v_k = (\\sqrt{\\lambda})^k w_k$. Substituting this into the recurrence yields:\n$$\n(\\sqrt{\\lambda})^{k+1}w_{k+1} - 2\\lambda(\\sqrt{\\lambda})^k w_k + \\lambda(\\sqrt{\\lambda})^{k-1} w_{k-1} = 0\n$$\nAssuming $\\lambda \\neq 0$, we can divide by $\\lambda (\\sqrt{\\lambda})^{k-1} = (\\sqrt{\\lambda})^{k+1}$:\n$$\nw_{k+1} - 2\\sqrt{\\lambda} w_k + w_{k-1} = 0\n$$\nThe boundary conditions for $w_k$ are derived from those for $v_k$:\n$v_0 = (\\sqrt{\\lambda})^0 w_0 = w_0 = 0$.\n$v_{N+1} = (\\sqrt{\\lambda})^{N+1} w_{N+1} = 0 \\implies w_{N+1}=0$.\n\nThe problem for $w_k$ is to find the values of $\\mu = \\sqrt{\\lambda}$ for which the recurrence $w_{k+1} - 2\\mu w_k + w_{k-1} = 0$ has a non-trivial solution satisfying $w_0=0$ and $w_{N+1}=0$. This is a standard eigenvalue problem. The characteristic equation is $r^2 - 2\\mu r + 1 = 0$. For a non-trivial solution, we need $|\\mu| \\le 1$. Let $\\mu = \\cos(\\theta)$. The roots are $r = e^{\\pm i\\theta}$. The general solution for $w_k$ is:\n$$\nw_k = C_1 \\cos(k\\theta) + C_2 \\sin(k\\theta)\n$$\nApplying the boundary condition $w_0=0$ gives $C_1=0$. Thus, $w_k = C_2 \\sin(k\\theta)$.\nApplying the boundary condition $w_{N+1}=0$ gives $C_2 \\sin((N+1)\\theta)=0$. For a non-trivial solution ($C_2 \\neq 0$), we must have $\\sin((N+1)\\theta)=0$.\nThis implies $(N+1)\\theta = j\\pi$ for an integer $j$. We obtain distinct eigenvalues for $j=1, 2, \\ldots, N$.\n$$\n\\theta_j = \\frac{j\\pi}{N+1}\n$$\nThe eigenvalues $\\mu_j$ are therefore:\n$$\n\\mu_j = \\cos(\\theta_j) = \\cos\\left(\\frac{j\\pi}{N+1}\\right)\n$$\nSince we defined $\\mu = \\sqrt{\\lambda}$, the eigenvalues of the Gauss-Seidel iteration matrix $G_{GS}$ are $\\lambda_j = \\mu_j^2$.\n$$\n\\lambda_j = \\cos^2\\left(\\frac{j\\pi}{N+1}\\right), \\quad j=1, 2, \\ldots, N\n$$\nThe spectral radius is the maximum of the absolute values of these eigenvalues.\n$$\n\\rho(G_{GS}) = \\max_{j=1, \\ldots, N} |\\lambda_j| = \\max_{j=1, \\ldots, N} \\left|\\cos^2\\left(\\frac{j\\pi}{N+1}\\right)\\right|\n$$\nSince $\\cos^2(x) \\ge 0$, the absolute value is redundant. The function $\\cos^2(x)$ is maximized when $|\\cos(x)|$ is maximized. The arguments $\\frac{j\\pi}{N+1}$ are in the interval $(0, \\pi)$. The function $|\\cos(x)|$ on this interval is largest for the argument closest to $0$ or $\\pi$.\nThe smallest argument corresponds to $j=1$: $\\theta_1 = \\frac{\\pi}{N+1}$.\nThe largest argument corresponds to $j=N$: $\\theta_N = \\frac{N\\pi}{N+1} = \\pi - \\frac{\\pi}{N+1}$.\nWe have $|\\cos(\\theta_N)| = |\\cos(\\pi - \\theta_1)| = |-\\cos(\\theta_1)| = \\cos(\\theta_1)$, since $\\theta_1 \\in (0, \\pi/2)$.\nThe maximum eigenvalue is thus achieved for $j=1$:\n$$\n\\rho(G_{GS}) = \\cos^2\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{N+1}\\right)\n$$\nThis is the closed-form expression for the spectral radius of the Gauss-Seidel iteration matrix as a function of the number of interior nodes $N$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\cos^2\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{N+1}\\right)}\n$$", "id": "2498183"}, {"introduction": "Real-world systems are rarely homogeneous, and this practice addresses the common engineering challenge of heat conduction through composite materials with different thermal conductivities.

Therefore, it is **VALID**. I will proceed with the analysis of the provided options.\n\n### Solution and Option Analysis\n\nThe Gauss-Seidel iteration for the system $A\\mathbf{T}=\\mathbf{b}$ is a stationary iterative method. Its convergence is governed by the properties of its iteration matrix $G_{GS}$. The error at iteration $k$, defined as $\\mathbf{e}^{(k)} = \\mathbf{T}^{(k)} - \\mathbf{T}^\\star$ where $\\mathbf{T}^\\star = A^{-1}\\mathbf{b}$ is the exact discrete solution, evolves according to $\\mathbf{e}^{(k)} = G_{GS} \\mathbf{e}^{(k-1)} = (G_{GS})^k \\mathbf{e}^{(0)}$. The residual is defined as $\\mathbf{r}^{(k)} = \\mathbf{b} - A\\mathbf{T}^{(k)} = -A\\mathbf{e}^{(k)}$.\n\n**Analysis of Option A:**\nThis statement comprises three parts.\n1.  \"The asymptotic convergence factor of Gauss–Seidel for this SPD problem is independent of $\\mathbf{T}^{(0)}$\". The asymptotic convergence factor is the spectral radius of the iteration matrix, $\\rho(G_{GS})$. The matrix $G_{GS}$ is derived from $A$ and does not depend on the initial guess $\\mathbf{T}^{(0)}$ or the right-hand side $\\mathbf{b}$. For the given problem (5-point stencil on a unit square), this factor is known to be $\\rho(G_{GS}) = (\\cos(\\pi h))^2 = (\\cos(\\pi/(N+1)))^2$. This depends only on the mesh size $h$, not the initial guess. This part is correct.\n2.  \"...the number of iterations required to achieve a fixed tolerance depends on the spectral content of the initial error $\\mathbf{e}^{(0)}=\\mathbf{T}^{(0)}-\\mathbf{T}^\\star$.\" The error after $k$ steps is $\\mathbf{e}^{(k)} = (G_{GS})^k \\mathbf{e}^{(0)}$. The number of iterations to reduce an error norm by a certain factor depends on the initial error norm $||\\mathbf{e}^{(0)}||$. Furthermore, the convergence behavior is modal. The error $\\mathbf{e}^{(0)}$ can be expanded in the eigenvectors of $G_{GS}$. Components of the error corresponding to eigenvalues close to $\\rho(G_{GS})$ (low-frequency modes) decay slowly, while components corresponding to small eigenvalues (high-frequency modes) decay rapidly. Thus, the spectral content of the initial error dictates the convergence trajectory. This part is correct.\n3.  \"Initializing to reduce high-frequency content (equivalently, to reduce the initial residual norm) typically decreases the iteration count.\" The residual is $\\mathbf{r}^{(0)} = -A\\mathbf{e}^{(0)}$. The matrix $A$ (discrete Laplacian) acts as a high-pass filter; it significantly amplifies the high-frequency components of the error vector $\\mathbf{e}^{(0)}$. Consequently, an initial error $\\mathbf{e}^{(0)}$ rich in high-frequency components will produce an initial residual $\\mathbf{r}^{(0)}$ with a large norm. Conversely, to obtain a small initial residual norm, the initial error must have small high-frequency content (i.e., the guess must be \"smooth\"). Starting with a smaller initial error/residual norm means the iteration begins closer to the solution, thus requiring fewer iterations to reach a given tolerance. This part is correct.\nConclusion: The entire statement is a correct description of the behavior of the Gauss-Seidel method.\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\n**Analysis of Option B:**\nThe statement claims that setting the initial guess for all interior nodes to zero, $\\mathbf{T}^{(0)} = \\mathbf{0}$, minimizes the initial residual norm $||\\mathbf{r}^{(0)}||$. The initial residual is $\\mathbf{r}^{(0)} = \\mathbf{b} - A\\mathbf{T}^{(0)}$. With $\\mathbf{T}^{(0)} = \\mathbf{0}$, the residual becomes $\\mathbf{r}^{(0)} = \\mathbf{b}$.\nThe problem of minimizing $||\\mathbf{b} - A\\mathbf{T}^{(0)}||$ over all possible vectors $\\mathbf{T}^{(0)}$ is a linear least-squares problem. Since the matrix $A$ is SPD and thus invertible, this norm has a unique global minimum of $0$, which is achieved when $A\\mathbf{T}^{(0)} = \\mathbf{b}$, i.e., when the initial guess is the exact solution itself, $\\mathbf{T}^{(0)} = \\mathbf{T}^\\star = A^{-1}\\mathbf{b}$.\nThe problem's boundary conditions, specifically $T(0,y)=\\sin(\\pi y)$, are non-zero. This ensures that the right-hand-side vector $\\mathbf{b}$ is not the zero vector. Therefore, the residual for a zero guess, $\\mathbf{r}^{(0)} = \\mathbf{b}$, is not the zero vector, and its norm is not the minimum possible value of $0$. The statement is false.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**Analysis of Option C:**\nThe statement asserts that bilinear interpolation of boundary values results in a discrete harmonic function, leading to a zero initial residual. A discrete function is \"discrete harmonic\" if the five-point stencil operator applied to it yields zero at all interior nodes. This is equivalent to the residual being zero *if the source term is zero*.\nLet's construct the bilinear interpolant $T_{bi}(x,y)$ for the given boundary conditions:\n$T_{bi}(x,y) = (1-x)T(0,y) + xT(1,y) + (1-y)T(x,0) + yT(x,1) - (\\text{corner terms})$.\nWith $T(0,y)=\\sin(\\pi y)$, $T(1,y)=0$, $T(x,0)=0$, $T(x,1)=0$, and all corner values being zero, the interpolant is $T_{bi}(x,y)=(1-x)\\sin(\\pi y)$.\nLet's test if this function is harmonic by computing its continuous Laplacian:\n$\\nabla^2 T_{bi} = \\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial x^2}((1-x)\\sin(\\pi y)) + \\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial y^2}((1-x)\\sin(\\pi y)) = 0 + (1-x)(-\\pi^2\\sin(\\pi y)) = -\\pi^2(1-x)\\sin(\\pi y)$.\nSince $\\nabla^2 T_{bi} \\neq 0$, the discrete Laplacian (which approximates the continuous one) will also be non-zero in general. Therefore, the function is not discrete harmonic, and the initial residual will not be zero. The premise of the statement is false. Bilinear interpolation only produces a discrete harmonic function for boundary data that is itself linear along the boundaries.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**Analysis of Option D:**\nThis statement describes the principle of coarse-grid correction, which is the foundation of multigrid methods. The strategy is to solve the problem on a coarser grid (e.g., with spacing $2h$) and then interpolate that solution to the fine grid ($h$) to use as an initial guess $\\mathbf{T}^{(0)}$.\nA coarse grid can only resolve low-frequency (long wavelength) variations. Therefore, the solution on the coarse grid, $\\mathbf{T}_{2h}$, is a good approximation of the low-frequency components of the true solution. Interpolating this to the fine grid, $\\mathbf{T}^{(0)} = I_{h}^{2h}\\mathbf{T}_{2h}$, yields an initial guess whose low-frequency content is very close to that of the true fine-grid solution $\\mathbf{T}_h^\\star$.\nConsequently, the initial error $\\mathbf{e}^{(0)} = \\mathbf{T}^{(0)} - \\mathbf{T}_h^\\star$ will be small in its low-frequency components. The remaining error will be dominated by high-frequency components, which are precisely the components that the Gauss-Seidel smoother is most effective at damping. This leads to rapid initial convergence and a significant reduction in the total number of iterations required. The statement is a correct description of a highly effective and widely used technique.\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\n**Analysis of Option E:**\nThis option proposes using an analytical solution as an initial guess. For the given problem, the boundary conditions are specified, and the PDE is the homogeneous Laplace equation. This problem can be solved analytically using separation of variables. The solution that satisfies all boundary conditions is $T^\\star_{cont}(x,y) = \\frac{\\sinh(\\pi(1-x))}{\\sinh(\\pi)}\\sin(\\pi y)$.\nThe proposal is to use this continuous solution, sampled at the grid points, as the initial guess: $T^{(0)}_{i,j} = T^\\star_{cont}(x_i, y_j)$.\nThe initial residual is $\\mathbf{r}^{(0)} = \\mathbf{b} - A \\mathbf{T}^{(0)}$. The exact discrete solution $\\mathbf{T}^\\star$ satisfies $A \\mathbf{T}^\\star = \\mathbf{b}$. Thus, $\\mathbf{r}^{(0)} = A\\mathbf{T}^\\star - A\\mathbf{T}^{(0)} = A(\\mathbf{T}^\\star - \\mathbf{T}^{(0)})$. The vector $\\mathbf{T}^\\star - \\mathbf{T}^{(0)}$ represents the difference between the exact discrete solution and the sampled exact continuous solution; this difference is the solution's discretization error, which is known to be of order $O(h^2)$ for the 5-point stencil. The norm of the matrix $A$ is $O(1)$. Therefore, the norm of the initial residual is $||\\mathbf{r}^{(0)}|| \\approx ||A|| \\cdot ||\\mathbf{T}^\\star - \\mathbf{T}^{(0)}|| = O(1) \\cdot O(h^2) = O(h^2)$.\nIn contrast, a trivial guess like $\\mathbf{T}^{(0)} = \\mathbf{0}$ yields a residual norm $||\\mathbf{r}^{(0)}|| = ||\\mathbf{b}|| = O(1)$. A bilinear guess also yields a residual of $O(1)$ as shown in C. Since $h$ is small, $O(h^2)$ is much smaller than $O(1)$. This much smaller initial residual leads to significantly faster convergence. The statement is correct.\n**Verdict: Correct**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{ADE}$$", "id": "2498156"}]}
