The flow is aligned with the $x$-direction, properties are uniform, and the Reynolds number is sufficiently low that convection can be neglected relative to viscous diffusion. The computational arrangement is a uniform staggered grid: pressure is stored at cell centers and velocity at cell faces. Let the pressure control volumes have uniform spacing $\\Delta x$. \n\nYou are to conceptually derive the pressureâ€“velocity coupling step used in the Semi-Implicit Method for Pressure-Linked Equations (SIMPLE). Use the following assumptions:\n\n- The $x$-momentum equation is the only momentum balance, written for each staggered velocity control volume and discretized by central differencing of the viscous term and a pressure-gradient source integrated over the control volume length $\\Delta x$.\n- Body forces, transients, and convection are neglected.\n- Let $u^{*}$ denote the guessed (predicted) velocity, and let the pressure and velocity corrections be $p'$ and $u'$, so that the corrected fields are $p = p^{*} + p'$ and $u = u^{*} + u'$.\n\nTasks:\n\n1.

The derivation will proceed step-by-step as requested.\n\nFirst, we derive the relationship between the velocity correction at a cell face and the pressure corrections in the adjacent control volumes. The discretized $x$-momentum equation for the velocity $u_f$ at a generic face $f$, under the given assumptions of negligible convection, transients, and body forces, relates the viscous forces to the pressure gradient. In the standard finite-volume form, this is written as:\n$$a_f u_f = \\sum_{nb} a_{nb} u_{nb} + (p_L - p_R)A$$\nwhere $a_f$ is the primary momentum discretization coefficient for $u_f$, $\\sum_{nb} a_{nb} u_{nb}$ represents the contribution from neighboring velocities due to viscous diffusion, $A$ is the cross-sectional area, and $p_L$ and $p_R$ are the pressures at the nodes to the left and right of face $f$. The SIMPLE algorithm uses a predictor-corrector approach. A guessed pressure field $p^*$ is used to solve the momentum equation for a predicted velocity field $u^*$:\n$$a_f u_f^* = \\left(\\sum_{nb} a_{nb} u_{nb}\\right)^* + (p_L^* - p_R^*)A$$\nHere, the term involving neighboring velocities is evaluated using the best available values, typically from the previous iteration. The corrected fields, $p = p^*+p'$ and $u = u^*+u'$, must satisfy the full momentum equation:\n$$a_f (u_f^*+u_f') = \\sum_{nb} a_{nb} (u_{nb}^*+u_{nb}') + (p_L^*+p_L' - (p_R^*+p_R'))A$$\nSubtracting the predictor equation from the full equation yields an equation for the corrections:\n$$a_f u_f' = \\sum_{nb} a_{nb} u_{nb}' + (p_L' - p_R')A$$\nA central approximation of the SIMPLE algorithm is to neglect the term $\\sum_{nb} a_{nb} u_{nb}'$, which contains the corrections of neighboring velocities. This omission decouples the velocity correction equations, yielding a simple, explicit relation for each velocity correction:\n$$a_f u_f' \\approx (p_L' - p_R')A$$\nRearranging this gives the desired linear relation between the velocity correction $u_f'$ and the adjacent pressure corrections $p_L'$ and $p_R'$:\n$$u_f' = \\frac{A}{a_f} (p_L' - p_R')$$\nComparing this to the requested form $u'_{f} = d_{f}\\,\\big(p'_{L} - p'_{R}\\big)$, we identify the coefficient $d_f$ as:\n$$d_f = \\frac{A}{a_f}$$\nThis coefficient links the velocity correction to the pressure correction gradient, with its magnitude determined by the area $A$ and the momentum coefficient $a_f$.\n\nNext, we enforce mass conservation to derive the pressure-correction equation. For a pressure control volume centered at node $P$, with west face $w$ and east face $e$, the steady, incompressible mass conservation requires the net volumetric flux to be zero: $(uA)_e - (uA)_w = 0$. Since the area $A$ is constant, this simplifies to $A(u_e - u_w) = 0$. The corrected velocity field must satisfy this condition:\n$$A\\left( (u_e^* + u_e') - (u_w^* + u_w') \\right) = 0$$\nThis implies that the corrections must balance the mass imbalance from the predicted field:\n$$A(u_e' - u_w') = -A(u_e^* - u_w^*) = A(u_w^* - u_e^*)$$\nWe now substitute the velocity correction formula. The east face $e$ is between nodes $P$ and $E$, so $u_e' = d_e(p_P' - p_E')$. The west face $w$ is between nodes $W$ and $P$, so $u_w' = d_w(p_W' - p_P')$. Substituting these into the continuity equation gives:\n$$A \\left[ d_e(p_P' - p_E') - d_w(p_W' - p_P') \\right] = A(u_w^* - u_e^*)$$\nGrouping terms for the unknown pressure corrections $p_W'$, $p_P'$, and $p_E'$ yields:\n$$A(d_e + d_w)p_P' - A d_w p_W' - A d_e p_E' = A(u_w^* - u_e^*)$$\nRearranging this into the standard linear system form $a_{P}^{p'}\\,p'_{P} = a_{W}^{p'}\\,p'_{W} + a_{E}^{p'}\\,p'_{E} + b_{P}$ gives:\n$$A(d_e + d_w)p_P' = A d_w p_W' + A d_e p_E' + A(u_w^* - u_e^*)$$\nBy comparing the two forms, we identify the coefficients: $a_W^{p'} = Ad_w$, $a_E^{p'} = Ad_e$, $b_P = A(u_w^* - u_e^*)$, and the diagonal coefficient:\n$$a_P^{p'} = a_W^{p'} + a_E^{p'} = A(d_e + d_w)$$\nUsing the expression $d_f = A/a_f$ derived previously, we express $a_P^{p'}$ in terms of the area $A$ and the momentum coefficients $a_w$ and $a_e$ at the west and east faces, respectively:\n$$a_P^{p'} = A \\left( \\frac{A}{a_e} + \\frac{A}{a_w} \\right) = A^2 \\left( \\frac{1}{a_e} + \\frac{1}{a_w} \\right)$$\n\nFor the third task, we simplify this expression using the provided formula for the momentum coefficient on a uniform grid with central differencing for diffusion only: $a_u = 2\\,\\mu\\,A/\\Delta x$. Since the grid is uniform and properties are constant, we have $a_w = a_e = a_u = 2\\,\\mu\\,A/\\Delta x$.

Substituting this into the equation for CV1:\n    $$\n    \\hat{a}_{P,1}\\,\\hat{p}^{\\prime}_{1} = \\hat{a}_{w}\\,\\hat{p}^{\\prime}_{1} + \\hat{a}_{12}\\,\\hat{p}^{\\prime}_{2} + \\hat{b}_{1}\n    $$\n    Using the provided definition $\\hat{a}_{P,1} = \\hat{a}_{w} + \\hat{a}_{12}$:\n    $$\n    (\\hat{a}_{w} + \\hat{a}_{12})\\,\\hat{p}^{\\prime}_{1} = \\hat{a}_{w}\\,\\hat{p}^{\\prime}_{1} + \\hat{a}_{12}\\,\\hat{p}^{\\prime}_{2} + \\hat{b}_{1}\n    $$\n    The $\\hat{a}_{w}\\,\\hat{p}^{\\prime}_{1}$ terms cancel, leaving the first equation of our system:\n    $$\n    \\hat{a}_{12}\\,\\hat{p}^{\\prime}_{1} - \\hat{a}_{12}\\,\\hat{p}^{\\prime}_{2} = \\hat{b}_{1}\n    $$\n\n*   **Equation for CV2:**\n    This cell is adjacent to the outlet. Its west neighbor is cell $1$, and its east neighbor is the outlet boundary face. The equation is:\n    $$\n    \\hat{a}_{P,2}\\,\\hat{p}^{\\prime}_{2} = \\hat{a}_{12}\\,\\hat{p}^{\\prime}_{1} + \\hat{a}_{e}\\,\\hat{p}^{\\prime}_{outlet} + \\hat{b}_{2}\n    $$\n    The Dirichlet condition at the outlet is $\\hat{p}'_{outlet}=0$. Substituting this gives:\n    $$\n    \\hat{a}_{P,2}\\,\\hat{p}^{\\prime}_{2} = \\hat{a}_{12}\\,\\hat{p}^{\\prime}_{1} + \\hat{b}_{2}\n    $$\n    Using the definition $\\hat{a}_{P,2} = \\hat{a}_{12} + \\hat{a}_{e}$ and rearranging, we get the second equation of our system:\n    $$\n    -\\hat{a}_{12}\\,\\hat{p}^{\\prime}_{1} + (\\hat{a}_{12} + \\hat{a}_{e})\\,\\hat{p}^{\\prime}_{2} = \\hat{b}_{2}\n    $$\n\nThe resulting $2 \\times 2$ linear system for $(\\hat{p}^{\\prime}_{1}, \\hat{p}^{\\prime}_{2})$ is:\n$$\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n\\hat{a}_{12} & -\\hat{a}_{12} \\\\\n-\\hat{a}_{12} & \\hat{a}_{12} + \\hat{a}_{e}\n\\end{pmatrix}\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n\\hat{p}^{\\prime}_{1} \\\\\n\\hat{p}^{\\prime}_{2}\n\\end{pmatrix}\n=\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n\\hat{b}_{1} \\\\\n\\hat{b}_{2}\n\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\n\n**Part 3: Solution of the Linear System**\n\nWe now solve this system for $\\hat{p}^{\\prime}_{1}$. A simple path to the solution is to add the two equations together:\n$$\n(\\hat{a}_{12} - \\hat{a}_{12})\\hat{p}^{\\prime}_{1} + (-\\hat{a}_{12} + \\hat{a}_{12} + \\hat{a}_{e})\\hat{p}^{\\prime}_{2} = \\hat{b}_{1} + \\hat{b}_{2}\n$$\nThis simplifies to:\n$$\n\\hat{a}_{e}\\hat{p}^{\\prime}_{2} = \\hat{b}_{1} + \\hat{b}_{2} \\quad \\implies \\quad \\hat{p}^{\\prime}_{2} = \\frac{\\hat{b}_{1} + \\hat{b}_{2}}{\\hat{a}_{e}}\n$$\nPhysically, this shows that the total mass imbalance from both cells, $\\hat{b}_{1} + \\hat{b}_{2}$, must be expelled through the outlet, driven by the pressure correction in the final cell, $\\hat{p}^{\\prime}_{2}$.\n\nNow, we substitute this expression for $\\hat{p}^{\\prime}_{2}$ back into the first equation, $\\hat{a}_{12}\\,\\hat{p}^{\\prime}_{1} - \\hat{a}_{12}\\,\\hat{p}^{\\prime}_{2} = \\hat{b}_{1}$, to solve for $\\hat{p}^{\\prime}_{1}$:\n$$\n\\hat{p}^{\\prime}_{1} = \\frac{\\hat{b}_{1}}{\\hat{a}_{12}} + \\hat{p}^{\\prime}_{2}\n$$\n$$\n\\hat{p}^{\\prime}_{1} = \\frac{\\hat{b}_{1}}{\\hat{a}_{12}} + \\frac{\\hat{b}_{1} + \\hat{b}_{2}}{\\hat{a}_{e}}\n$$\nThis is the symbolic solution for $\\hat{p}^{\\prime}_{1}$.\n\nFinally, we substitute the given numerical values:\n$\\hat{a}_{12} = 1.37$\n$\\hat{a}_{e} = 0.81$\n$\\hat{b}_{1} = 0.071$\n$\\hat{b}_{2} = 0.023$\n\n$$\n\\hat{p}^{\\prime}_{1} = \\frac{0.071}{1.37} + \\frac{0.071 + 0.023}{0.81}\n$$\n$$\n\\hat{p}^{\\prime}_{1} = \\frac{0.071}{1.37} + \\frac{0.094}{0.81}\n$$\n$$\n\\hat{p}^{\\prime}_{1} \\approx 0.051824817... + 0.116049382...\n$$\n$$\n\\hat{p}^{\\prime}_{1} \\approx 0.1678742...\n$$\nRounding to five significant figures, the result is $0.16787$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{0.16787}\n$$", "id": "2516603"}]}
