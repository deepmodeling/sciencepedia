We may proceed.\n\nThe objective is to derive an expression for the relative error $\\varepsilon$ between a non-conservative and a conservative finite-volume approximation for heat flux at a material interface.\n\nFirst, we derive the conservative expression for the interfacial heat flux per unit area, $q_f$, at the location $x=0$. The foundation of this derivation is the enforcement of heat flux continuity, which is a direct consequence of energy conservation for one-dimensional, steady-state heat conduction with no sources. Let $T_f$ be the temperature at the interface face, $x=0$.\n\nApplying Fourier's Law, $-k \\frac{dT}{dx}$, to the two control volume halves adjacent to the interface, we obtain two expressions for the flux.\nFor the interval $x \\in [-\\delta_W, 0]$, the flux is approximated as:\n$$\nq_f = -k_1 \\frac{T_f - T_W}{0 - (-\\delta_W)} = k_1 \\frac{T_W - T_f}{\\delta_W}\n$$\nFor the interval $x \\in [0, \\delta_E]$, the flux is approximated as:\n$$\nq_f = -k_2 \\frac{T_E - T_f}{\\delta_E - 0} = k_2 \\frac{T_f - T_E}{\\delta_E}\n$$\nFor a conservative scheme, these two expressions for the flux must be equal. This allows us to solve for the unknown interface temperature $T_f$:\n$$\nk_1 \\frac{T_W - T_f}{\\delta_W} = k_2 \\frac{T_f - T_E}{\\delta_E}\n$$\nRearranging the terms to solve for $T_f$:\n$$\n\\frac{k_1}{\\delta_W} T_W - \\frac{k_1}{\\delta_W} T_f = \\frac{k_2}{\\delta_E} T_f - \\frac{k_2}{\\delta_E} T_E\n$$\n$$\nT_f \\left( \\frac{k_1}{\\delta_W} + \\frac{k_2}{\\delta_E} \\right) = \\frac{k_1}{\\delta_W} T_W + \\frac{k_2}{\\delta_E} T_E\n$$\n$$\nT_f = \\frac{\\frac{k_1}{\\delta_W} T_W + \\frac{k_2}{\\delta_E} T_E}{\\frac{k_1}{\\delta_W} + \\frac{k_2}{\\delta_E}}\n$$\nThis expression for $T_f$ is a weighted average of the nodal temperatures $T_W$ and $T_E$, where the weights are the thermal conductances of the half-cells.

If one refines the mesh while keeping this ratio constant, the error $\\varepsilon$ due to the non-conservative arithmetic average does not vanish. This demonstrates that such a scheme is not consistent. The error is zero only if $k_1 = k_2$ (a homogeneous medium) or, non-trivially, if the mesh is constructed such that $k_1 \\delta_E = k_2 \\delta_W$, or $\\frac{\\delta_W}{\\delta_E} = \\frac{k_1}{k_2}$. This specific grid spacing cancels the error for this simple problem but is not a generally applicable solution.

A solution will be provided.\n\n**Part 1: Calculation of First Cell Height $y_1$**\n\nThe nondimensional wall-normal distance, $y^+$, is defined as:\n$$y^+ = \\frac{y u_{\\tau}}{\\nu}$$\nwhere $y$ is the physical distance from the wall, $u_{\\tau}$ is the friction velocity, and $\\nu$ is the kinematic viscosity of the fluid. We are required to find the height of the first cell center, which we denote as $y_1$, such that the corresponding nondimensional distance is $y^+ = 1$.\n\nRearranging the definition for $y_1$, we have:\n$$y_1 = \\frac{y^{+} \\nu}{u_{\\tau}}$$\n\nWe are given the following values:\n-   $y^+ = 1$ (dimensionless target)\n-   $\\nu = 1.6 \\times 10^{-5}\\,\\mathrm{m^2/s}$\n-   $u_{\\tau} = 0.45\\,\\mathrm{m/s}$\n\nSubstituting these values into the equation for $y_1$:\n$$y_1 = \\frac{(1) \\times (1.6 \\times 10^{-5}\\,\\mathrm{m^2/s})}{0.45\\,\\mathrm{m/s}}$$\n$$y_1 = \\frac{1.6}{0.45} \\times 10^{-5}\\,\\mathrm{m}$$\n$$y_1 \\approx 3.5555... \\times 10^{-5}\\,\\mathrm{m}$$\n\nRounding the result to four significant figures as required by the problem statement:\n$$y_1 \\approx 3.556 \\times 10^{-5}\\,\\mathrm{m}$$\n\n**Part 2: Sensitivity of Nusselt Number Prediction**\n\nThe second part requires a qualitative discussion on the sensitivity of the predicted local Nusselt number $Nu$ to the placement of the first grid point $y_1$, as long as it remains within the viscous sublayer (i.e., $y_1^+ \\lesssim 5$).\n\nThe local Nusselt number is defined as $Nu = h L_c/k$, where the heat transfer coefficient is $h = q''_w / (T_w - T_\\infty)$. Therefore, $Nu$ is directly proportional to the wall heat flux, $q''_w$. The accuracy of the predicted $Nu$ is thus directly dependent on the accuracy of the computed wall heat flux.\n\nThe wall heat flux is given by Fourier's law at the wall:\n$$q''_w = -k \\left. \\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial y} \\right|_{y=0}$$\nIn a cell-centered finite volume method, this gradient is typically approximated using a first-order, one-sided difference scheme:\n$$q''_{w, \\text{num}} = -k \\frac{T_1 - T_w}{y_1 - 0} = k \\frac{T_w - T_1}{y_1}$$\nwhere $T_1$ is the temperature at the first cell center, located at $y=y_1$.\n\nTo analyze the accuracy of this approximation, we must examine the behavior of the temperature profile $T(y)$ very close to the wall. The Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) energy equation for steady, incompressible flow with constant properties is:\n$$\\frac{\\partial (U_j T)}{\\partial x_j} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x_j} \\left( \\alpha \\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial x_j} - \\overline{u'_j T'} \\right) + S_T$$\nwhere $\\alpha = k/(\\rho c_p)$ is the thermal diffusivity and $-\\overline{u'_j T'}$ is the turbulent heat flux. For a two-dimensional boundary layer, and very close to the wall ($y \\to 0$), convective terms are negligible. The equation simplifies to a balance between molecular and turbulent diffusion in the wall-normal direction:\n$$\\frac{d}{dy} \\left( \\alpha \\frac{dT}{dy} - \\overline{v'T'} \\right) \\approx 0$$\nThis implies that the total heat flux, $q_{total} = -k \\frac{dT}{dy} + \\rho c_p \\overline{v'T'}$, is approximately constant and equal to the wall heat flux $q''_w$.\n\nWithin the viscous sublayer ($y^+ \\lesssim 5$), turbulent fluctuations are heavily damped by viscous effects. Specifically, the wall-normal velocity fluctuation $v'$ must satisfy $v' \\propto y^2$ due to continuity and no-slip conditions, and temperature fluctuations near an isothermal wall scale as $T' \\propto y$. This leads to the turbulent heat flux scaling as $\\overline{v'T'} \\propto y^3$ or higher powers of $y$. Consequently, the turbulent heat flux is negligible compared to the molecular heat flux for very small $y$.\n\nThe energy equation in the viscous sublayer thus reduces to:\n$$\\frac{d}{dy}\\left( k \\frac{dT}{dy} \\right) \\approx 0 \\quad \\implies \\quad -k \\frac{dT}{dy} \\approx \\text{constant} = q''_w$$\nThis indicates that the temperature profile is nearly linear with respect to $y$:\n$$T(y) \\approx T_w - \\frac{q''_w}{k} y$$\nIf the temperature profile were perfectly linear, the finite difference approximation $q''_{w, \\text{num}} = k(T_w - T_1)/y_1$ would be exact, because substituting the linear profile gives $T_1 = T_w - (q''_w/k)y_1$, and thus $q''_{w, \\text{num}} = k(T_w - (T_w - (q''_w/k)y_1))/y_1 = q''_w$.\n\nThe error in the numerical approximation arises from the deviation of the true temperature profile from a perfect line. To find the leading-order error, we use a Taylor series expansion of $T(y)$ around $y=0$:\n$$T(y) = T(0) + T'(0)y + \\frac{T''(0)}{2}y^2 + \\frac{T'''(0)}{6}y^3 + \\mathcal{O}(y^4)$$\nThe numerically approximated gradient is $\\frac{T(y_1)-T(0)}{y_1} = T'(0) + \\frac{T''(0)}{2}y_1 + \\frac{T'''(0)}{6}y_1^2 + \\mathcal{O}(y_1^3)$.\nFrom the simplified energy equation, $\\frac{d^2 T}{dy^2} = \\frac{1}{\\alpha} \\frac{d}{dy}(\\overline{v'T'})$. Since $\\overline{v'T'} \\propto y^3$, its derivative $\\frac{d}{dy}(\\overline{v'T'})$ scales as $y^2$. This means $T''(y) \\propto y^2$ and importantly, $T''(0)=0$.\nThe Taylor series is therefore $T(y) = T_w + T'(0)y + \\mathcal{O}(y^3)$. A more careful analysis of the energy balance including the $\\overline{v'T'} \\propto y^3$ term actually yields $T'''(0)=0$ and a leading non-linear term of $\\mathcal{O}(y^4)$. Let's assume the more general case based on the Taylor series itself. With $T''(0)=0$, the error in the gradient calculation is:\n$$\\text{Error} = \\left(\\frac{T(y_1)-T_w}{y_1}\\right) - T'(0) = \\frac{T'''(0)}{6}y_1^2 + \\mathcal{O}(y_1^3)$$\nThe error in the computed wall heat flux $q''_{w, \\text{num}}$ is thus of second order with respect to the first cell height $y_1$.\n$$\\text{Error}(q''_w) \\propto y_1^2$$\nExpressing this in wall units, the relative error in the Nusselt number prediction scales with the square of the non-dimensional wall distance of the first cell center:\n$$\\frac{\\Delta Nu}{Nu} \\propto (y_1^+)^2$$\nBecause the error depends on the square of $y_1^+$, it remains very small for values of $y_1^+ \\lesssim 5$. For instance, doubling $y_1^+$ from $1$ to $2$ (both well within the viscous sublayer) would quadruple the discretization error, but the absolute error, being proportional to a small quantity squared, is still small. This demonstrates a relative insensitivity of the predicted heat transfer to the precise placement of the first grid point, provided it is kept within the viscous sublayer. The strict requirement of $y^+ \\approx 1$ is often more critical for accurately resolving the velocity field and the turbulence quantities ($k$ and $\\omega$), whose profiles exhibit stronger non-linearity closer to the wall.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{3.556 \\times 10^{-5}}$$", "id": "2506403"}, {"introduction": "Before a numerical simulation can be trusted, we must verify that the code correctly solves the intended equations and that the solution is free from significant discretization error.

It must be verified that this function satisfies the homogeneous partial differential equation (PDE), the boundary conditions, and provides the initial condition. The solution is:\n$$\nT_{\\text{exact}}(x,t) \\;=\\; \\cos(\\pi x)\\,\\exp(-\\pi^2 \\alpha t)\n$$\nChecking the PDE: $\\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial t} = -\\pi^2 \\alpha \\cos(\\pi x)\\exp(-\\pi^2 \\alpha t) = -\\pi^2 \\alpha T_{\\text{exact}}$ and $\\frac{\\partial^2 T}{\\partial x^2} = -\\pi^2 \\cos(\\pi x)\\exp(-\\pi^2 \\alpha t) = -\\pi^2 T_{\\text{exact}}$. Thus, $\\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial t} = \\alpha \\frac{\\partial^2 T}{\\partial x^2}$ is satisfied.\nChecking the boundary conditions: $\\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial x} = -\\pi \\sin(\\pi x) \\exp(-\\pi^2 \\alpha t)$. At $x=0$, $\\sin(0)=0$. At $x=1$, $\\sin(\\pi)=0$. Both boundary conditions are satisfied.\nThe initial condition is derived from this solution at $t=0$:\n$$\nT(x,0)\\;=\\;\\cos(\\pi x)\n$$\nThe constants are given as $\\alpha=1 \\, \\mathrm{m^2/s}$ and the final time is $T_f=0.1 \\, \\mathrm{s}$. The problem states to treat temperature $T$ as a nondimensional quantity.\n\nThe numerical scheme involves a finite difference method for spatial discretization and the Crank-Nicolson method for time integration.\n\n**1. Spatial Discretization**\n\nThe spatial domain $[0,1]$ is discretized using $N$ uniformly spaced points $x_i = i h$ for $i=0, 1, \\dots, N-1$, with grid spacing $h=1/(N-1)$. The second spatial derivative is approximated using a second-order central difference formula for interior points $i=1, \\dots, N-2$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial^2 T}{\\partial x^2}\\bigg|_{x_i} \\approx \\frac{T_{i-1} - 2T_i + T_{i+1}}{h^2}\n$$\nThe homogeneous Neumann boundary conditions are implemented using second-order accurate approximations involving mirrored ghost points. At $x=0$, a central difference $\\frac{T_1 - T_{-1}}{2h}=0$ implies the ghost point value is $T_{-1}=T_1$. Substituting this into the central difference formula at $i=0$ yields:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial^2 T}{\\partial x^2}\\bigg|_{x_0} \\approx \\frac{T_1 - 2T_0 + T_{-1}}{h^2} = \\frac{2T_1 - 2T_0}{h^2}\n$$\nSimilarly, at $x=1$, the condition $\\frac{T_N - T_{N-2}}{2h}=0$ gives $T_N=T_{N-2}$. At $i=N-1$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial^2 T}{\\partial x^2}\\bigg|_{x_{N-1}} \\approx \\frac{T_N - 2T_{N-1} + T_{N-2}}{h^2} = \\frac{2T_{N-2} - 2T_{N-1}}{h^2}\n$$\nThis leads to a semi-discretized system of ordinary differential equations:\n$$\n\\frac{d\\vec{T}}{dt} = \\frac{\\alpha}{h^2} A \\vec{T}\n$$\nwhere $\\vec{T} = [T_0, T_1, \\dots, T_{N-1}]^T$ is the vector of temperatures at the grid points, and $A$ is the $N \\times N$ discrete Laplacian matrix:\n$$\nA = \\begin{pmatrix}\n-2 & 2 & 0 & \\dots & 0 \\\\\n1 & -2 & 1 & \\ddots & \\vdots \\\\\n0 & \\ddots & \\ddots & \\ddots & 0 \\\\\n\\vdots & \\ddots & 1 & -2 & 1 \\\\\n0 & \\dots & 0 & 2 & -2\n\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\n\n**2. Temporal Discretization**\n\nThe Crank-Nicolson method, an implicit trapezoidal rule, is applied to the semi-discretized system. For a time step $\\Delta t$, the scheme is:\n$$\n\\frac{\\vec{T}^{n+1} - \\vec{T}^n}{\\Delta t} = \\frac{1}{2} \\left( \\frac{\\alpha}{h^2} A \\vec{T}^{n+1} + \\frac{\\alpha}{h^2} A \\vec{T}^n \\right)\n$$\nwhere $\\vec{T}^n$ denotes the solution at time $t_n = n \\Delta t$. Rearranging the terms to solve for the unknown $\\vec{T}^{n+1}$:\n$$\n\\left(I - \\frac{\\alpha \\Delta t}{2h^2} A\\right) \\vec{T}^{n+1} = \\left(I + \\frac{\\alpha \\Delta t}{2h^2} A\\right) \\vec{T}^n\n$$\nLet the dimensionless parameter be $\\lambda = \\alpha \\Delta t / h^2$. The equation becomes:\n$$\n\\left(I - \\frac{\\lambda}{2} A\\right) \\vec{T}^{n+1} = \\left(I + \\frac{\\lambda}{2} A\\right) \\vec{T}^n\n$$\nAt each time step, this constitutes a tridiagonal linear system, which is solved efficiently using a banded matrix solver.\n\n**3. Implementation and Verification Tests**\n\nA solver is implemented based on the above formulation.\n1.  Initialize the temperature field $\\vec{T}^0$ using the initial condition $T(x,0) = \\cos(\\pi x)$.\n2.  Iterate for $N_t = \\text{round}(T_f/\\Delta t)$ time steps. In each step, we solve the linear system for $\\vec{T}^{n+1}$.\n3.  After the final time step, compute the discrete $L^2$ error norm against the exact solution at $t=T_f$:\n    $$\n    \\|e\\|_{2,h} = \\left(h \\sum_{i=0}^{N-1} (T_i^{\\text{num}} - T_{\\text{exact}}(x_i, T_f))^2\\right)^{1/2}\n    $$\nThe convergence orders are estimated by a linear least-squares fit on the logarithm of the error versus the logarithm of the resolution parameter ($h$ or $\\Delta t$). The slope of the fitted line, $p$, is the observed order.\n\nThe required tests are performed:\n\n- **Spatial Convergence Study**: The time step is fixed at $\\Delta t = 10^{-3} \\, \\mathrm{s}$, which ensures temporal discretization error is negligible. The number of grid points $N$ is varied through $\\{33, 65, 129, 257\\}$, corresponding to decreasing grid spacings $h$. The slope of $\\log(\\|e\\|_{2,h})$ versus $\\log(h)$ yields the spatial order $p_s$. The expectation for a second-order scheme is $p_s \\approx 2$. Error monotonicity is verified.\n\n- **Temporal Convergence Study**: The number of grid points is fixed at $N=1025$, ensuring spatial discretization error is negligible. The time step $\\Delta t$ is varied through $\\{10^{-2}, 5 \\cdot 10^{-3}, 2.5 \\cdot 10^{-3}, 1.25 \\cdot 10^{-3}\\} \\, \\mathrm{s}$. The slope of $\\log(\\|e\\|_{2,h})$ versus $\\log(\\Delta t)$ yields the temporal order $q_t$. The expectation for the second-order Crank-Nicolson method is $q_t \\approx 2$.\n\n- **Boundary Condition Check**: For a run with $N=65$ and $\\Delta t=10^{-3} \\, \\mathrm{s}$, the numerical gradients $|(T_1-T_0)/h|$ and $|(T_{N-1}-T_{N-2})/h|$ are computed at $t=T_f$ and checked against the tolerance of $10^{-3}$.\n\nFinally, the computed orders $p_s$ and $q_t$ are checked against the theoretical value of $2$ within a tolerance of $0.2$, and all results are formatted as requested.", "answer": "```python\n# The complete and runnable Python 3 code goes here.\n# Imports must adhere to the specified execution environment.\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy.linalg import solve_banded\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves the 1D transient heat equation to verify spatial and temporal\n    convergence orders using the Method of Manufactured Solutions.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Global parameters from the problem statement\n    alpha = 1.0\n    Tf = 0.1\n\n    def get_exact_solution(x, t, alpha_val):\n        \"\"\"Computes the manufactured exact solution.\"\"\"\n        return np.cos(np.pi * x) * np.exp(-np.pi**2 * alpha_val * t)\n\n    def run_solver(N, dt):\n        \"\"\"\n        Core PDE solver for given spatial (N) and temporal (dt) resolution.\n        \n        Args:\n            N (int): Number of grid points.\n            dt (float): Time step size.\n            \n        Returns:\n            numpy.ndarray: The numerical solution T(x, Tf) at the final time.\n        \"\"\"\n        h = 1.0 / (N - 1)\n        x = np.linspace(0.0, 1.0, N)\n        \n        # Dimensionless parameter for the CN scheme\n        lam = alpha * dt / h**2\n        \n        # --- Set up Crank-Nicolson matrices ---\n        # The LHS matrix M_lhs = (I - (lambda/2) * A) is prepared in the\n        # banded format required by scipy.linalg.solve_banded.\n        # For a tridiagonal matrix, the banded format is a 3xN array.\n        M_lhs_banded = np.zeros((3, N))\n        \n        # Main diagonal of M_lhs\n        M_lhs_banded[1, :] = 1.0 + lam\n        \n        # Super-diagonal of M_lhs\n        super_diag_lhs = np.full(N - 1, -lam / 2.0)\n        super_diag_lhs[0] = -lam  # Modified entry for the Neumann BC at x=0\n        M_lhs_banded[0, 1:] = super_diag_lhs\n        \n        # Sub-diagonal of M_lhs\n        sub_diag_lhs = np.full(N - 1, -lam / 2.0)\n        sub_diag_lhs[-1] = -lam # Modified entry for the Neumann BC at x=1\n        M_lhs_banded[2, :-1] = sub_diag_lhs\n        \n        # --- Initial condition ---\n        T = get_exact_solution(x, 0.0, alpha)\n\n        # --- Time-stepping loop ---\n        num_steps = int(round(Tf / dt))\n        for _ in range(num_steps):\n            # Build RHS vector: b = (I + (lambda/2) * A) * T\n            # This is done efficiently without forming the full matrix A.\n            v = np.zeros(N)\n            # Interior points\n            v[1:-1] = T[:-2] - 2 * T[1:-1] + T[2:]\n            # Boundary points (enforcing Neumann BCs)\n            v[0] = 2 * T[1] - 2 * T[0]\n            v[-1] = 2 * T[-2] - 2 * T[-1]\n\n            rhs_vec = T + (lam / 2.0) * v\n            \n            # Solve the tridiagonal system for the next time step\n            T = solve_banded((1, 1), M_lhs_banded, rhs_vec)\n            \n        return T\n\n    # --- 1.
