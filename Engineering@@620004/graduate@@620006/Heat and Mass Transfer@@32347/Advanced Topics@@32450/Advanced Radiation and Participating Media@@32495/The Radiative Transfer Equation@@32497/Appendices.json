The medium exhibits pure absorption and thermal emission under local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) at a uniform temperature $T_0$. Let the spectral absorption coefficient be constant, $\\kappa_{\\nu}$, and the spectral source function under LTE be given by Kirchhoff’s law as $S_{\\nu} = B_{\\nu}(T_0)$, where $B_{\\nu}$ is the Planck function at frequency $\\nu$.

We shall proceed with its solution.\n\nThe fundamental principle governing the transport of radiant energy is the conservation of energy along a ray. The change in spectral specific intensity, $dI_{\\nu}$, over a differential path length $ds$ in a participating medium is the sum of gains from emission and losses from absorption. This is expressed as:\n$$ \\frac{dI_{\\nu}}{ds} = -\\alpha_{\\nu}I_{\\nu} + j_{\\nu} $$\nwhere $\\alpha_{\\nu}$ is the absorption coefficient and $j_{\\nu}$ is the emission coefficient. The problem states that the medium is non-scattering, so scattering terms are absent. Under the condition of local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE), Kirchhoff's law relates the emission and absorption coefficients via the Planck function $B_{\\nu}(T)$. For a medium with refractive index of unity, this relation is $j_{\\nu} = \\alpha_{\\nu} B_{\\nu}(T)$. The problem gives the spectral absorption coefficient as $\\kappa_{\\nu}$, which is a synonym for $\\alpha_{\\nu}$. Thus, $j_{\\nu} = \\kappa_{\\nu} B_{\\nu}(T_0)$, where the temperature $T_0$ is uniform throughout the slab.\n\nThe equation of transfer becomes:\n$$ \\frac{dI_{\\nu}}{ds} = -\\kappa_{\\nu}I_{\\nu} + \\kappa_{\\nu}B_{\\nu}(T_0) $$\nFor a plane-parallel geometry, the path length $ds$ along a ray is related to the coordinate $x$ normal to the slab by $ds = \\frac{dx}{\\mu}$, where $\\mu = \\cos\\theta$ and $\\theta$ is the polar angle with respect to the $+x$-axis. Substituting this into the equation gives the one-dimensional radiative transfer equation (RTE) for this problem:\n$$ \\mu \\frac{dI_{\\nu}(x, \\mu)}{dx} = -\\kappa_{\\nu}I_{\\nu}(x, \\mu) + \\kappa_{\\nu}B_{\\nu}(T_0) $$\nThis is a first-order linear ordinary differential equation for $I_{\\nu}$ with respect to $x$, which we will solve subject to the given boundary conditions.

The integrating factor is $\\exp\\left(\\int \\frac{\\kappa_{\\nu}}{\\mu} dx\\right) = \\exp\\left(\\frac{\\kappa_{\\nu}x}{\\mu}\\right)$, since $\\kappa_{\\nu}$ and $\\mu$ are constant with respect to $x$.

It requests a first-principles derivation of energy conservation for an analog Monte Carlo simulation and a corresponding numerical implementation to verify this property. The problem is scientifically grounded, internally consistent, and free of ambiguity. We shall proceed with the derivation and solution.\n\nThe fundamental principle governing the problem is the conservation of energy, which in the context of steady-state radiative transfer, is expressed by the integral balance form of the Radiative Transfer Equation (RTE). For any control volume $V$ with boundary $\\partial V$, the total power injected by sources within the volume must equal the power absorbed within the volume plus the net power escaping across its boundary. Mathematically, this is:\n$$\n\\int_{V} \\int_{4\\pi} S(\\mathbf{r}, \\mathbf{\\Omega}) \\, d\\Omega \\, dV = \\int_{V} \\int_{4\\pi} \\sigma_a(\\mathbf{r}) I(\\mathbf{r}, \\mathbf{\\Omega}) \\, d\\Omega \\, dV + \\oint_{\\partial V} \\int_{4\\pi} (\\mathbf{\\Omega} \\cdot \\mathbf{n}) I(\\mathbf{r}, \\mathbf{\\Omega}) \\, d\\Omega \\, dA\n$$\nwhere $S$ is the source emissivity, $I$ is the radiance, $\\sigma_a$ is the absorption coefficient, and $\\mathbf{n}$ is the outward normal to the boundary surface element $dA$. The problem defines a unit-power source ($ \\int S \\, d\\Omega \\, dV = 1 $), so the left side is $1$. The first term on the right is the total absorbed power $A$, and the second is the total escaped power $E$. Thus, the physical system rigorously satisfies $A+E=1$.\n\nA Monte Carlo simulation models this continuous process by tracking discrete histories of energy packets (\"photons\"). An estimator for a physical quantity is deemed \"unbiased\" if its expected value over all possible random histories equals the true physical quantity. We are asked to show that the proposed analog Monte Carlo scheme leads to an expected global energy balance, i.e., $\\mathbb{E}[\\widehat{A} + \\widehat{E}_0 + \\widehat{E}_L] = 1$, where hatted quantities are the Monte Carlo estimators.\n\nWe will trace the expected weight of a single packet, launched with initial weight $W_0=1$. A packet's history is a sequence of stochastic events: free flights followed by collisions or boundary interactions. The core of the proof lies in demonstrating that the total expected weight is conserved at each event.\n\nConsider a packet of weight $W$ arriving at a stochastic event. The event comprises a set of mutually exclusive outcomes $\\{o_i\\}$ with probabilities $p_i$, where $\\sum_i p_i = 1$. The analog simulation method handles this by selecting one outcome $o_j$ based on a random number draw. If the outcome is terminal (e.g., absorption, escape), the packet's full weight $W$ is scored to the corresponding tally and the history ends. If the outcome is non-terminal (e.g., scattering, reflection), the packet's state is updated and it continues its history with its weight unchanged.\n\nLet's analyze the two event types in this problem:\n\n1.  **Collision Event**: A packet traverses a free path and arrives at a collision site within the medium. The two possible outcomes are absorption and scattering.\n    -   The probability of absorption is $p_a = \\sigma_a / \\sigma_t$. In the analog scheme, this event is terminal. The weight scored to the absorption tally $\\widehat{A}$ is $W$.\n    -   The probability of scattering is $p_s = \\sigma_s / \\sigma_t$. This event is non-terminal. The packet's weight remains $W$ post-scattering.\n    -   The total expected weight is partitioned into a deposited component (absorbed) and a surviving component (scattered).\n        -   Expected deposited weight: $\\mathbb{E}[W_{dep}] = W \\cdot p_a + 0 \\cdot p_s = W p_a$.\n        -   Expected surviving weight: $\\mathbb{E}[W_{surv}] = 0 \\cdot p_a + W \\cdot p_s = W p_s$.\n    -   The sum of expected weights is $\\mathbb{E}[W_{dep}] + \\mathbb{E}[W_{surv}] = W p_a + W p_s = W(p_a + p_s) = W(\\frac{\\sigma_a}{\\sigma_t} + \\frac{\\sigma_s}{\\sigma_t}) = W$.\n    -   Thus, the total expected weight is conserved across a collision event.\n\n2.  **Boundary Interaction Event**: A packet travels to a boundary at $z=0$ or $z=L$. The two possible outcomes are transmission (escape) and reflection.\n    -   The probability of escape is $p_t = 1-\\rho$. This is a terminal event. The weight $W$ is scored to the appropriate escape tally, $\\widehat{E}_0$ or $\\widehat{E}_L$.\n    -   The probability of specular reflection is $p_r = \\rho$. This is non-terminal. The packet's weight remains $W$.\n    -   The partition of expected weight is:\n        -   Expected deposited weight (escaped): $\\mathbb{E}[W_{dep}] = W \\cdot p_t + 0 \\cdot p_r = W(1-\\rho)$.\n        -   Expected surviving weight (reflected): $\\mathbb{E}[W_{surv}] = 0 \\cdot p_t + W \\cdot p_r = W\\rho$.\n    -   The sum of expected weights is $\\mathbb{E}[W_{dep}] + \\mathbb{E}[W_{surv}] = W(1-\\rho) + W\\rho = W$.\n    -   Total expected weight is conserved across a boundary event as well.\n\nThis demonstrates that the proposed simulation rules constitute unbiased Bernoulli branchings that conserve expected weight at every step.\n\nNow, we extend this to a full packet history. Let $W_k$ be the packet's weight entering its $k$-th event, and $D_k$ be the random variable for the weight deposited at this event (which is non-zero only if the event is terminal). From the analysis above, $\\mathbb{E}[W_k] + \\mathbb{E}[D_k] = \\mathbb{E}[W_{k-1}]$. Starting with $W_0=1$, we can write this recursively:\n$$ \\mathbb{E}[W_k] = \\mathbb{E}[W_{k-1}] - \\mathbb{E}[D_k] = W_0 - \\sum_{i=1}^k \\mathbb{E}[D_i] = 1 - \\sum_{i=1}^k \\mathbb{E}[D_i] $$\nFor any physically realistic scenario in a finite domain (as in all test cases), a packet cannot undergo an infinite number of events. There is always a non-zero probability of termination (absorption or escape). Therefore, as the number of events $k \\to \\infty$, the probability of the packet surviving tends to zero, which means $\\lim_{k\\to\\infty} \\mathbb{E}[W_k] = 0$. This forces the conclusion that the sum of all expected depositions over the entire history must be unity:\n$$ \\sum_{k=1}^\\infty \\mathbb{E}[D_k] = 1 $$\nThe total absorbed fraction for a single history is $A_{hist} = \\sum_{k} D_{k,abs}$, and the total escaped fractions are $E_{0,hist} = \\sum_{k} D_{k,esc,0}$ and $E_{L,hist} = \\sum_{k} D_{k,esc,L}$. In an analog simulation, only one of these will be $1$ and the others $0$.\nThe total deposited weight for one history is $D_{total} = A_{hist} + E_{0,hist} + E_{L,hist}$. Its expectation is $\\mathbb{E}[D_{total}] = \\sum_k \\mathbb{E}[D_k] = 1$.\nThe Monte Carlo estimators are the averages over $N$ independent histories: $\\widehat{A} = \\frac{1}{N}\\sum_{j=1}^N A_{hist,j}$, and similarly for $\\widehat{E}_0$ and $\\widehat{E}_L$.\nBy linearity of expectation:\n$$ \\mathbb{E}[\\widehat{A} + \\widehat{E}_0 + \\widehat{E}_L] = \\mathbb{E}[A_{hist} + E_{0,hist} + E_{L,hist}] = \\mathbb{E}[D_{total}] = 1 $$\nFinally, the expectation of the global-balance residual $\\widehat{R}$ is:\n$$ \\mathbb{E}[\\widehat{R}] = \\mathbb{E}[1 - (\\widehat{A} + \\widehat{E}_0 + \\widehat{E}_L)] = 1 - \\mathbb{E}[\\widehat{A} + \\widehat{E}_0 + \\widehat{E}_L] = 1 - 1 = 0 $$\nThis completes the derivation.\n\nFor the implementation, a computable tally is designed based on this analog (\"unit-weight\") transport scheme. For each of the $N$ simulated packets, we track its path until it is terminated by either absorption or escape. We maintain three counters: $N_{abs}$, $N_{esc,0}$, and $N_{esc,L}$. When a packet's history ends, the corresponding counter is incremented. Since every packet history must end in one of these three states, we must have $N_{abs} + N_{esc,0} + N_{esc,L} = N$.\nThe estimators are then computed as $\\widehat{A} = N_{abs}/N$, $\\widehat{E}_0 = N_{esc,0}/N$, and $\\widehat{E}_L = N_{esc,L}/N$. The absolute residual is calculated as $|\\widehat{R}| = |1.0 - (\\widehat{A} + \\widehat{E}_0 + \\widehat{E}_L)|$. While mathematically this sum should be precisely $1$, the use of finite-precision floating-point arithmetic means that the fractions like $N_{abs}/N$ may not be exactly representable. The sum of these inexact numbers may deviate slightly from $1.0$, resulting in a computed residual on the order of machine epsilon ($ \\sim 10^{-16} $). This residual serves as a stringent check on the correctness of the simulation logic; any value significantly larger than machine epsilon would indicate a flaw, such as \"lost\" packets.\n\nThe simulation algorithm for a single packet is as follows:\n1.  Initialize the packet at position $z=0$ with direction $\\mu=1$.\n2.  In a loop, perform the following steps until the packet is terminated:\n    a.  Calculate the total interaction coefficient $\\sigma_t = \\sigma_a + \\sigma_s$.\n    b.  Sample a random free-path length $s$ from the exponential distribution $p(s) = \\sigma_t e^{-\\sigma_t s}$ using inverse transform sampling: $s = -\\ln(\\xi) / \\sigma_t$, where $\\xi$ is a uniform random number in $(0, 1)$. Handle the case $\\sigma_t=0$, where $s$ becomes infinite.\n    c.  Calculate the distance to the nearest boundary, $s_b$. If $\\mu>0$, $s_b = (L-z)/\\mu$. If $\\mu<0$, $s_b = -z/\\mu$. If $\\mu=0$, $s_b$ is infinite.\n    d.  If $s < s_b$, the next event is a collision. Advance the packet to $z \\leftarrow z + s\\mu$. With probability $\\sigma_a/\\sigma_t$, terminate the packet and tally as absorbed. Otherwise, with probability $\\sigma_s/\\sigma_t$, scatter the packet by sampling a new isotropic direction $\\mu$ uniformly from $[-1, 1]$ and continue the loop.\n    e.  If $s \\ge s_b$, the next event is a boundary interaction. Advance the packet to the boundary ($z=L$ if $\\mu>0$, $z=0$ if $\\mu<0$). With probability $\\rho$, the packet reflects specularly ($\\mu \\leftarrow -\\mu$) and continues. Otherwise, with probability $1-\\rho$, the packet escapes; terminate and tally the escape at the appropriate boundary.", "answer": "```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef simulate_packet(L, sigma_a, sigma_s, rho):\n    \"\"\"\n    Simulates the history of a single unit-weight photon packet.\n\n    Args:\n        L (float): Thickness of the slab.\n        sigma_a (float): Absorption coefficient.\n        sigma_s (float): Scattering coefficient.\n        rho (float): Specular reflectance of the boundaries.\n\n    Returns:\n        str: The outcome of the packet history, one of\n             'absorbed', 'escaped_z0', 'escaped_zL'.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Packet state: z-position and direction cosine mu.\n    z = 0.0\n    mu = 1.0\n    \n    sigma_t = sigma_a + sigma_s\n\n    while True:\n        # Sample free path length 's'\n        if sigma_t > 0:\n            # Using 1 - rand() to avoid log(0)\n            s = -np.log(1.0 - np.random.rand()) / sigma_t\n        else:\n            s = np.inf\n\n        # Calculate distance to nearest boundary 's_b'\n        if mu > 1e-9:  # Traveling in +z direction\n            s_b = (L - z) / mu\n        elif mu < -1e-9:  # Traveling in -z direction\n            s_b = -z / mu\n        else:  # Traveling parallel to boundaries\n            s_b = np.inf\n\n        # Determine next event\n        if s < s_b:\n            # Collision event\n            z += s * mu\n\n            # Decide between absorption and scattering\n            absorption_prob = sigma_a / sigma_t if sigma_t > 0 else 0.0\n            if np.random.rand() < absorption_prob:\n                return 'absorbed'  # Packet is absorbed\n            else:\n                # Isotropic scattering: sample new direction\n                mu = 2.0 * np.random.rand() - 1.0\n        else:\n            # Boundary interaction event\n            # Move packet to the boundary\n            if mu > 0:\n                z = L\n            else:\n                z = 0.0\n\n            # Decide between reflection and transmission (escape)\n            if np.random.rand() < rho:\n                # Specular reflection\n                mu = -mu\n            else:\n                # Transmission (escape)\n                if z == L:\n                    return 'escaped_zL'\n                else: # z == 0\n                    return 'escaped_z0'\n\ndef run_simulation(L, sigma_a, sigma_s, rho, N):\n    \"\"\"\n    Runs a full Monte Carlo simulation for a given set of parameters.\n\n    Args:\n        L (float): Slab thickness.\n        sigma_a (float): Absorption coefficient.\n        sigma_s (float): Scattering coefficient.\n        rho (float): Boundary reflectance.\n        N (int): Number of photon packets to simulate.\n    \n    Returns:\n        float: The absolute global-balance residual |R_hat|.\n    \"\"\"\n    tallies = {\n        'absorbed': 0,\n        'escaped_z0': 0,\n        'escaped_zL': 0\n    }\n\n    for _ in range(N):\n        outcome = simulate_packet(L, sigma_a, sigma_s, rho)\n        tallies[outcome] += 1\n    \n    # Verify that all packets were terminated and tallied.\n    # This sum must equal N for a correct analog simulation.\n    total_tallied = sum(tallies.values())\n    if total_tallied != N:\n        raise RuntimeError(f\"Energy conservation violation in tally counts: \"\n                         f\"sum of tallies {total_tallied} != N {N}\")\n\n    # Calculate fractions based on tallies\n    A_hat = tallies['absorbed'] / N\n    E0_hat = tallies['escaped_z0'] / N\n    EL_hat = tallies['escaped_zL'] / N\n    \n    # Calculate the global-balance residual.

The problem is therefore deemed valid.\n\nThe problem requires the numerical solution of the steady, one-dimensional, gray radiative transfer equation (RTE) in a plane-parallel slab with isotropic scattering and isothermal emission. The governing equation for the specific intensity $I(x, \\mu)$ is:\n$$\n\\mu \\frac{d I(x,\\mu)}{dx} + \\sigma_t I(x,\\mu) = \\sigma_a B + \\frac{\\sigma_s}{2} \\int_{-1}^{1} I(x,\\mu') \\, d\\mu' = S(x)\n$$\nwhere $x \\in [0, L]$ is the spatial coordinate, $\\mu \\in [-1, 1]$ is the direction cosine, $\\sigma_t$ is the extinction coefficient, $\\sigma_a$ is the absorption coefficient, $\\sigma_s$ is the scattering coefficient, $B$ is the constant blackbody source term, and $S(x)$ is the total volumetric source. The slab is subject to vacuum boundary conditions, meaning no radiation enters from the outside:\n$$\nI(0, \\mu) = 0 \\quad \\text{for } \\mu > 0, \\quad \\text{and} \\quad I(L, \\mu) = 0 \\quad \\text{for } \\mu < 0.\n$$\nThe solution methodology follows a structured numerical approach involving discretization in angle and space, coupled through an iterative scheme.\n\nFirst, the angular dependency is discretized using the Discrete Ordinates ($S_N$) method. The integral in the source term is replaced by a Gauss-Legendre quadrature sum of order $N_\\mu$ with nodes $\\{\\mu_k\\}$ and weights $\\{w_k\\}$. This converts the single integro-differential equation into a coupled system of $N_\\mu$ ordinary differential equations, one for each discrete direction $\\mu_k$:\n$$\n\\mu_k \\frac{d I_k(x)}{dx} + \\sigma_t I_k(x) = \\sigma_a B + \\frac{\\sigma_s}{2} \\sum_{j=1}^{N_\\mu} w_j I_j(x), \\quad k=1, \\dots, N_\\mu\n$$\nwhere $I_k(x) \\equiv I(x, \\mu_k)$.\n\nSecond, the spatial domain $[0, L]$ is discretized into a uniform mesh of $N_x$ cells, each of width $\\Delta x = L/N_x$. The numerical scheme employed is the step-characteristics method. This method assumes the total source term is piecewise constant within each cell $i$, taking the value $S_i$. Under this assumption, the ODE for each direction $k$ and cell $i$ can be solved exactly. Let $I_{\\text{in},k}$ be the intensity at the incoming face of a cell. The intensity at the outgoing face, $I_{\\text{out},k}$, after traversing a path length of $\\Delta x / |\\mu_k|$, is given by:\n$$\nI_{\\text{out},k} = I_{\\text{in},k} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\sigma_t \\Delta x}{|\\mu_k|}\\right) + \\frac{S_i}{\\sigma_t} \\left(1 - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\sigma_t \\Delta x}{|\\mu_k|}\\right)\\right)\n$$\nThe quantity required for the iterative update is the cell-averaged intensity, $\\bar{I}_{i,k}$. By integrating the exact within-cell solution for $I_k(x)$ over the cell width $\\Delta x$, we obtain the following relation:\n$$\n\\bar{I}_{i,k} = I_{\\text{in},k} \\left(\\frac{1 - \\exp(-\\tau_k)}{\\tau_k}\\right) + \\frac{S_i}{\\sigma_t} \\left(1 - \\frac{1 - \\exp(-\\tau_k)}{\\tau_k}\\right)\n$$\nwhere $\\tau_k = \\sigma_t \\Delta x / |\\mu_k|$ is the optical thickness of the cell along direction $\\mu_k$. These relations form the basis of the transport sweep.\n\nThe coupling between angles via the scattering source term is resolved using source iteration. The algorithm proceeds as follows:\n1. Initialize the scalar flux field, $\\phi_i^{(0)}$, for all cells $i=1, \\dots, N_x$ (e.g., to zero).\n2. For iteration $m = 0, 1, 2, \\dots$:\n   a. Compute the cell-wise constant source term $S_i^{(m)} = \\sigma_a B + \\frac{\\sigma_s}{2} \\phi_i^{(m)}$.\n   b. Perform a transport sweep to find the new cell-averaged intensities, $\\bar{I}_{i,k}^{(m+1)}$. For each direction $\\mu_k > 0$, sweep from $x=0$ to $x=L$ (cell index $i=1$ to $N_x$), using the vacuum boundary condition $I(0, \\mu_k)=0$. For each $\\mu_k < 0$, sweep from $x=L$ to $x=0$ ($i=N_x$ to $1$), using $I(L, \\mu_k)=0$. In each cell, the outgoing face intensity is computed and becomes the incoming intensity for the next cell in the sweep direction, and the cell-averaged intensity is stored.\n   c. Update the scalar flux in each cell using the new intensities: $\\phi_i^{\\text{new}} = \\sum_{k=1}^{N_\\mu} w_k \\bar{I}_{i,k}^{(m+1)}$.\n   d. A simple relaxation with $\\lambda=1$ is applied, so $\\phi_i^{(m+1)} = \\phi_i^{\\text{new}}$.\n   e. Check for convergence by comparing the new and old scalar flux fields: $\\max_i |\\phi_i^{(m+1)} - \\phi_i^{(m)}| < \\varepsilon$. If not converged, repeat from step 2a.\n\nFinally, a convergence analysis is performed to determine the observed order of convergence (OOC) for both spatial and angular discretizations. This is done by running simulations on a sequence of progressively refined meshes/quadratures and comparing them to a high-resolution reference solution. The OOC, $p$, is calculated using solutions on two successive refinement levels, one coarser (c) and one finer (f), via the formula:\n$$\np = \\frac{\\ln(e_c / e_f)}{\\ln(h_c / h_f)}\n$$\nwhere $e$ is the error norm and $h$ is the discretization parameter ($\\Delta x$ or $1/N_\\mu$). For this problem, the refinement ratio $h_c/h_f$ is always $2$. The errors for scalar flux ($e_\\phi$) and intensity ($e_I$) at the slab center are computed as specified in the problem. For the angular refinement study, the intensity error calculation requires piecewise-linear interpolation of the coarse-angle intensity profile onto the fine reference-angle set before computing the weighted RMS error.\n\nThe provided Python code implements this entire procedure. A primary function, `rte_solver`, encapsulates the source iteration and transport sweep logic.
