For the specified four-point quadrature, the expression is:\n$$\n\\bar{\\mathcal{T}} \\approx \\sum_{i=1}^{4} w_i \\exp(-k_i u)\n$$\nIn this expression, $\\{w_i, k_i\\}$ for $i=1, 2, 3, 4$ are the quadrature weights and abscissae (absorption cross-sections), and $u$ is the absorber amount, also known as the column density.\n\nThe absorber amount $u$ is defined as the product of the path length, $L$, and the number density of the absorbing species, $n$:\n$$\nu = L n\n$$\nThe gas mixture is treated as an ideal gas. Consequently, the number density $n$ of the absorbing species, which has a mole fraction $x$ in a mixture at total pressure $p$ and temperature $T$, is determined from the ideal gas law:\n$$\nn = \\frac{x p}{k_B T}\n$$\nwhere $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant.\n\nBy substituting the expression for $n$ into the definition of $u$, we obtain the absorber amount in terms of the primary state variables provided in the problem:\n$$\nu = \\frac{L x p}{k_B T}\n$$\nSubstituting this result into the quadrature formula yields the complete expression for the band-mean transmissivity in terms of the primary parameters, as requested:\n$$\n\\bar{\\mathcal{T}} \\approx \\sum_{i=1}^{4} w_i \\exp\\left(-k_i \\frac{L x p}{k_B T}\\right)\n$$\nWe now proceed to evaluate this expression numerically using the provided data:\n- Path length, $L = 3.00\\ \\mathrm{m}$.\n- Gas pressure, $p = 1.00 \\times 10^5\\ \\mathrm{Pa}$.\n- Gas temperature, $T = 1200\\ \\mathrm{K}$.\n- Mole fraction of absorbing species, $x = 0.0200$.\n- Boltzmann constant, $k_B = 1.380649 \\times 10^{-23}\\ \\mathrm{J/K}$.\n\nFirst, we calculate the numerical value of the absorber amount, $u$:\n$$\nu = \\frac{(3.00) (0.0200) (1.00 \\times 10^5)}{(1.380649 \\times 10^{-23}) (1200)} \\approx 3.62148 \\times 10^{23}\\ \\mathrm{m^{-2}}\n$$\nThe dimensionless optical depths at each quadrature point, $\\tau_i = k_i u$, are calculated using the given values for $k_i$:\n- For $i=1$: $k_1 = 1.8 \\times 10^{-24}\\ \\mathrm{m}^2$, giving $\\tau_1 = (1.8 \\times 10^{-24}) (3.62148 \\times 10^{23}) \\approx 0.65187$\n- For $i=2$: $k_2 = 7.0 \\times 10^{-24}\\ \\mathrm{m}^2$, giving $\\tau_2 = (7.0 \\times 10^{-24}) (3.62148 \\times 10^{23}) \\approx 2.53504$\n- For $i=3$: $k_3 = 2.8 \\times 10^{-23}\\ \\mathrm{m}^2$, giving $\\tau_3 = (2.8 \\times 10^{-23}) (3.62148 \\times 10^{23}) \\approx 10.1401$\n- For $i=4$: $k_4 = 1.0 \\times 10^{-22}\\ \\mathrm{m}^2$, giving $\\tau_4 = (1.0 \\times 10^{-22}) (3.62148 \\times 10^{23}) \\approx 36.2148$\n\nNow, we compute each term of the summation, $w_i \\exp(-\\tau_i)$, using the provided quadrature weights $w_i$:\n- Term $1$: $w_1 \\exp(-\\tau_1) = 0.17 \\times \\exp(-0.65187) \\approx 0.17 \\times 0.52108 \\approx 0.088584$\n- Term $2$: $w_2 \\exp(-\\tau_2) = 0.33 \\times \\exp(-2.53504) \\approx 0.33 \\times 0.07926 \\approx 0.026156$\n- Term $3$: $w_3 \\exp(-\\tau_3) = 0.33 \\times \\exp(-10.1401) \\approx 0.33 \\times 3.946 \\times 10^{-5} \\approx 0.000013$\n- Term $4$: $w_4 \\exp(-\\tau_4) = 0.17 \\times \\exp(-36.2148) \\approx 0.17 \\times 1.27 \\times 10^{-16} \\approx 2.16 \\times 10^{-17}$\n\nThe fourth term is, as expected for a large optical depth, negligibly small compared to the first two terms. The sum of these four contributions gives the band-mean transmissivity:\n$$\n\\bar{\\mathcal{T}} \\approx 0.088584 + 0.026156 + 0.000013 + 2.16 \\times 10^{-17}\n$$\n$$\n\\bar{\\mathcal{T}} \\approx 0.114753\n$$\nRounding the result to four significant figures, as required by the problem statement, we obtain the final answer:\n$$\n\\bar{\\mathcal{T}} \\approx 0.1148\n$$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.1148}$$", "id": "2509480"}]}
