The gas is a binary mixture of water vapor and carbon dioxide with partial pressures $p_{\\text{H2O}}$ and $p_{\\text{CO2}}$. Assume local thermodynamic equilibrium and that the hemispherical emissivity equals the normal-direction absorptivity for this geometry. You are to model the directional (normal) total emissivity using the Weighted-Sum-of-Gray-Gases Model (WSGGM), with species-specific gray-gas parameters given below.\n\nStarting from Beer–Lambert attenuation, the definition of gas emissivity through Kirchhoff’s law, and the modeling idea that the band-averaged transmissivity can be represented as a weighted sum of exponentials with temperature-dependent weights and species-specific gray absorption coefficients, derive the expression you will use to compute the mixture emissivity.

A complete, reasoned solution will be provided.\n\n**Derivation of the Mixture Emissivity Expression**\n\nThe problem requires the derivation of the WSGGM expression for mixture emissivity, starting from fundamental principles.\n\n1.  According to the Beer-Lambert law, the spectral transmissivity $\\tau_{\\nu}$ of a homogeneous gas layer of thickness $L$ with a spectral absorption coefficient $\\kappa_{\\nu}$ is given by:\n    $$ \\tau_{\\nu} = \\exp(-\\kappa_{\\nu} L) $$\n2.  For a gas in local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE), Kirchhoff's law equates the spectral emissivity $\\varepsilon_{\\nu}$ to the spectral absorptivity $\\alpha_{\\nu}$. For a non-scattering medium, $\\alpha_{\\nu} = 1 - \\tau_{\\nu}$. Thus:\n    $$ \\varepsilon_{\\nu} = \\alpha_{\\nu} = 1 - \\tau_{\\nu} = 1 - \\exp(-\\kappa_{\\nu} L) $$\n3.  The total emissivity $\\varepsilon$ is the Planck-function-weighted average of the spectral emissivity over all wavenumbers $\\nu$:\n    $$ \\varepsilon = \\frac{\\int_0^\\infty \\varepsilon_{\\nu} E_{b\\nu}(T) d\\nu}{\\int_0^\\infty E_{b\\nu}(T) d\\nu} = \\frac{1}{\\sigma T^4} \\int_0^\\infty \\left(1 - \\exp(-\\kappa_{\\nu} L)\\right) E_{b\\nu}(T) d\\nu $$\n    where $E_{b\\nu}(T)$ is the spectral blackbody emissive power.\n4.  The WSGGM approximates this complex integration by representing the gas as a hypothetical mixture of $N$ gray gases and one clear gas ($j=0$, with $\\kappa_0=0$). The total emissivity is expressed as a weighted sum of the emissivities of these gray gases:\n    $$ \\varepsilon \\approx \\sum_{j=0}^{N} a_j(T) \\varepsilon_j $$\n    The weight $a_j(T)$ represents the fraction of blackbody emissive power in the spectral regions modeled by the $j$-th gray gas, and by definition, $\\sum_{j=0}^{N} a_j(T) = 1$. The emissivity of the clear gas is $\\varepsilon_0 = 1 - \\exp(-0 \\cdot L) = 0$. Therefore, the summation is performed over the absorbing gray gases ($j=1, \\dots, N$):\n    $$ \\varepsilon = \\sum_{j=1}^{N} a_j(T) \\varepsilon_j = \\sum_{j=1}^{N} a_j(T) \\left(1 - \\exp(-\\kappa_j L)\\right) $$\n5.  For a mixture of non-reacting gases, the absorption coefficient of the $j$-th gray gas, $\\kappa_j$, is given by a mole-fraction-weighted sum of the species-specific coefficients. For an ideal gas mixture, mole fractions are equal to partial pressure fractions. The absorption coefficient is correctly expressed as:\n    $$ \\kappa_j = \\sum_{s} p_s k_{j,s} $$\n    where $p_s$ is the partial pressure of species $s$ and $k_{j,s}$ is the species-specific WSGGM absorption coefficient for the $j$-th gray gas. The unit of $\\kappa_j$ is inverse length ($\\text{m}^{-1}$), as $p_s$ is in $\\text{bar}$ and $k_{j,s}$ is in $\\text{m}^{-1}\\,\\text{bar}^{-1}$.\n6.  Substituting the mixture rule for $\\kappa_j$ into the WSGGM formulation gives the final expression for the total emissivity of a gas mixture:\n    $$ \\varepsilon_{\\text{mix}} = \\sum_{j=1}^{N} a_j(T) \\left[ 1 - \\exp\\left(-L \\sum_{s} p_s k_{j,s}\\right) \\right] $$\nThis is the expression used for the subsequent calculations.\n\n**Part 1: Mixture Emissivity Calculation**\n\nThe mixture consists of species $s \\in \\{\\text{H}_2\\text{O}, \\text{CO}_2\\}$.

Thus, each term $a_{i} \\beta_{i} \\exp(-\\beta_{i} L)$ is non-negative.\nThe sum is a sum of non-negative terms. Assuming the gas is not completely transparent (i.e., at least one $a_{i}  0$ for $i \\ge 1$), the sum will be strictly positive.\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial \\varepsilon_{g}}{\\partial L}  0 \\quad (\\text{for non-transparent gas})\n$$\nPhysically, this positive sign means that the total emissivity of the gas layer, $\\varepsilon_{g}$, increases as its thickness $L$ increases. This is logical: a thicker layer contains more participating molecules to emit radiation, thus increasing the total emission from the volume, provided the gas is not already effectively black.\n\n**Sign of the second derivative, $\\frac{\\partial^{2} \\varepsilon_{g}}{\\partial L^{2}}$:**\nThe expression is $\\frac{\\partial^{2} \\varepsilon_{g}}{\\partial L^{2}} = - \\sum_{i=0}^{N} a_{i} \\beta_{i}^{2} \\exp(-\\beta_{i} L)$.\nLet us examine the sum $\\sum_{i=0}^{N} a_{i} \\beta_{i}^{2} \\exp(-\\beta_{i} L)$:\n- As before, $a_{i} \\ge 0$ and $\\exp(-\\beta_{i} L)  0$.\n- The parameter $\\beta_{i}^{2}$ is non-negative, with $\\beta_{0}^{2} = 0$ and $\\beta_{i}^{2}  0$ for $i \\ge 1$.\nThe term for $i=0$ is $a_{0}\\beta_{0}^{2}\\exp(-\\beta_{0}L) = 0$.\nFor all $i \\in \\{1, 2, \\dots, N\\}$, the term $a_{i} \\beta_{i}^{2} \\exp(-\\beta_{i} L)$ is non-negative.\nThe sum $\\sum_{i=0}^{N} a_{i} \\beta_{i}^{2} \\exp(-\\beta_{i} L)$ is therefore a sum of non-negative terms. For a non-transparent gas, this sum is strictly positive.\nThe second derivative is the negative of this sum.\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial^{2} \\varepsilon_{g}}{\\partial L^{2}}  0 \\quad (\\text{for non-transparent gas})\n$$\nPhysically, the negative sign of the second derivative indicates that the function $\\varepsilon_{g}(L)$ is concave down. This means that the rate of increase of emissivity, $\\frac{\\partial \\varepsilon_{g}}{\\partial L}$, decreases as the layer thickness $L$ increases. This phenomenon is known as **saturation**.\nFor a thin gas layer (small $L$), emissivity increases sharply as $L$ grows because each additional sub-layer of gas contributes significantly to the emission. However, as the layer becomes optically thick, radiation originating from deep within the gas is increasingly re-absorbed by the gas itself before it can escape. This self-absorption effect means that adding more gas to an already thick layer has a diminishing effect on the total observed emission. In the limit as $L \\to \\infty$, the gas becomes opaque in its absorbing bands, its emissivity approaches its maximum value of $1-a_0$, and the rate of increase of emissivity approaches zero. The negative second derivative is the mathematical signature of this saturation behavior.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} \\sum_{i=0}^{N} a_{i} \\beta_{i} \\exp(-\\beta_{i} L)  - \\sum_{i=0}^{N} a_{i} \\beta_{i}^{2} \\exp(-\\beta_{i} L) \\end{pmatrix}}\n$$", "id": "2538223"}]}
