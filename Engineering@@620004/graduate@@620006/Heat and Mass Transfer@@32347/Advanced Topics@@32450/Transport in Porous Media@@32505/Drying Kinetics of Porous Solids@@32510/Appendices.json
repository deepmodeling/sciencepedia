These conditions, combined with constant material properties, imply that the individual fluxes $N_l$ and $N_v$ must be constant throughout the domain $0 < x < L$. If $N_v$ is constant, and other parameters such as $\\rho_g$ and $D_{v, \\text{eff}}$ are also given as constant, then the expression for $N_v$ must not contain any spatially varying terms. The more complete model for diffusion through a stagnant gas, $N_v = - \\frac{\\rho_g D_{v, \\text{eff}}}{1-Y_v} \\frac{\\mathrm{d}Y_v}{\\mathrm{d}x}$, would lead to a spatially varying flux $N_v(x)$ if $Y_v(x)$ is not constant. This contradicts the steady-state scenario without internal phase change implied by the given linear profiles. Therefore, the problem structure dictates that the convective component of the vapor flux must be neglected, and the total vapor flux is approximated by the diffusive flux alone:\n$$ N_v \\approx j_v = - \\rho_g D_{v, \\text{eff}} \\frac{\\mathrm{d}Y_v}{\\mathrm{d}x} $$\nThe linear profile for $Y_v$ from $x=0$ to $x=L$ means the gradient is constant:\n$$ \\frac{\\mathrm{d}Y_v}{\\mathrm{d}x} = \\frac{Y(L) - Y(0)}{L} $$\nThe effective diffusivity $D_{v, \\text{eff}}$ is calculated using the given Bruggeman-type relation:\n$$ D_{v, \\text{eff}} = \\varepsilon_g^{3/2} D_{AB} $$\nwhere $D_{AB}$ is the binary diffusivity in the free gas and $\\varepsilon_g$ is the gas-filled porosity, given by $\\varepsilon_g = \\varepsilon(1 - S_l)$, with $\\varepsilon$ being the total porosity and $S_l$ the liquid saturation.\n\nCombining the expressions for the liquid and vapor fluxes, the total moisture flux $N$ is:\n$$ N = \\rho_l \\frac{k_{rl} \\kappa}{\\mu_l} \\frac{\\mathrm{d}p_c}{\\mathrm{d}x} - \\rho_g \\left(\\varepsilon_g^{3/2} D_{AB}\\right) \\frac{Y(L) - Y(0)}{L} $$\nWe now compute the numerical value.
