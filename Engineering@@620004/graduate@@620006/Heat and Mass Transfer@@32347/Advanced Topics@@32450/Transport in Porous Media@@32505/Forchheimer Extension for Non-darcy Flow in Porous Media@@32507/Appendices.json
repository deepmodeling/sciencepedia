There are no subjective or non-scientific elements.\n- The problem does not violate any of the invalidity criteria. It is not scientifically unsound, non-formalizable, incomplete, unrealistic, or ill-posed.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem statement is **valid**. A full solution will be derived.\n\n**Derivation**\n\nThe steady, incompressible flow of a Newtonian fluid at the pore scale is governed by the Navier-Stokes equations:\n$$ \\rho (\\mathbf{v} \\cdot \\nabla) \\mathbf{v} = -\\nabla p + \\mu \\nabla^2 \\mathbf{v} $$\nwhere $\\mathbf{v}$ is the local microscopic velocity vector, $p$ is the local pressure, $\\rho$ is the fluid density, and $\\mu$ is the dynamic viscosity.\n\nThe macroscopic flow is described by volume-averaged quantities. The macroscopic pressure gradient, $\\langle -\\nabla p \\rangle$, is related to the superficial velocity, $\\langle v \\rangle$.\n\nIn the limit of very slow flow (creeping flow, pore-scale Reynolds number $Re_p \\to 0$), the inertial term $\\rho (\\mathbf{v} \\cdot \\nabla) \\mathbf{v}$ is negligible. Volume averaging the resulting Stokes equation ($0 = -\\nabla p + \\mu \\nabla^2 \\mathbf{v}$) yields Darcy's Law:\n$$ \\langle -\\nabla p \\rangle_v = \\frac{\\mu}{K} \\langle v \\rangle $$\nHere, the pressure drop is due entirely to viscous dissipation, and the permeability $K$ is a geometric property that quantifies the medium's conductance to flow.\n\nAs the flow velocity increases, the inertial term $\\rho (\\mathbf{v} \\cdot \\nabla) \\mathbf{v}$, which represents convective acceleration, becomes significant. This term gives rise to additional pressure losses. The volume average of this term leads to a macroscopic inertial pressure drop that scales quadratically with velocity. The Forchheimer equation phenomenologically captures this correction:\n$$ \\langle -\\nabla p \\rangle = \\langle -\\nabla p \\rangle_v + \\langle -\\nabla p \\rangle_i = \\underbrace{\\frac{\\mu}{K} \\langle v \\rangle}_{\\text{Viscous term}} + \\underbrace{\\rho \\beta \\langle v \\rangle^2}_{\\text{Inertial term}} $$\nThe Forchheimer coefficient, $\\beta$ (with units of inverse length, e.g., $m^{-1}$), is a macroscopic property of the porous medium that quantifies the magnitude of these inertial losses. It is determined by the pore-scale geometry.\n\nThe physical origins of the inertial pressure loss, $\\langle -\\nabla p \\rangle_i$, are the pore-scale effects of the convective acceleration term:\n1.  **Streamline Curvature (Tortuosity):** Fluid particles moving along curved streamlines undergo centripetal acceleration. This requires a force, which is supplied by an additional pressure gradient. Highly tortuous media with meandering streamlines (small local radius of curvature) induce large accelerations and thus large inertial pressure losses.\n2.  **Expansion and Contraction (Form Drag):** As the fluid passes through sequences of pore throats (contractions) and pore bodies (expansions), it undergoes repeated acceleration and deceleration. In the expansion zones, the flow can separate from the pore walls, creating eddies and wakes. The dissipation of kinetic energy in these regions results in an irreversible pressure loss, often called form drag. Pronounced and sharp changes in cross-sectional area amplify this effect.\n\nNow, we compare Medium I and Medium II. Both media have the same $K$, meaning they offer the same resistance to flow in the purely viscous (creeping) regime. However, their geometries are designed to produce different inertial effects.\n\n-   **Medium I** is described as having \"nearly straight\" pores with \"weak curvature\" and \"limited expansion-contraction.\" This geometry is explicitly designed to minimize both sources of inertial loss. The straight paths reduce losses from streamline curvature, and the uniform pore size minimizes form drag from expansion/contraction cycles. Therefore, Medium I is expected to have a low value of $\\beta$.\n\n-   **Medium II** is described as having \"meandering streamlines (small local radius of curvature)\" and \"pronounced expansion-contraction\" due to its network of throats and bodies. This geometry is explicitly designed to maximize inertial losses. The meandering paths create significant losses due to tortuosity, and the abrupt transitions between narrow throats and large bodies generate substantial form drag. Therefore, Medium II is expected to have a large value of $\\beta$.\n\nSince $\\beta$ directly quantifies the magnitude of these geometry-induced inertial effects, Medium II will have a significantly larger $\\beta$ than Medium I, even though their Darcy permeabilities $K$ are identical.\n\n**Option-by-Option Analysis**\n\n**A. Medium II has a larger $\\beta$ because smaller local radius of curvature and stronger expansion–contraction amplify convective acceleration and form drag, increasing the inertial pressure drop per unit length at fixed $K$.**\nThis statement correctly identifies that Medium II will have a larger $\\beta$. The reasoning provided is physically sound and aligns perfectly with the derivation above. \"Smaller local radius of curvature\" corresponds to tortuosity/meandering, and \"stronger expansion-contraction\" corresponds to form drag. These are the two principal mechanisms for inertial losses, which are captured by the $\\beta$ coefficient. The statement correctly links these micro-scale geometric features to the macroscopic parameter $\\beta$.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. Both media have the same $\\beta$ because equality of $K$ completely determines all geometry-dependent pressure-loss characteristics, including inertial effects.**\nThis statement is incorrect. The Darcy permeability $K$ characterizes the viscous dissipation in the Stokes flow limit. The Forchheimer coefficient $\\beta$ characterizes the inertial losses that become important at higher Reynolds numbers. They are distinct geometric parameters. It is a fundamental concept in porous media physics that two media can have the same $K$ but different $\\beta$ values due to differences in tortuosity and pore interconnectivity, which is precisely the scenario described in the problem.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. Medium I has a larger $\\beta$ because uniformity of pore size increases the inertial contribution relative to a heterogeneous network at fixed $K$.**\nThis statement is incorrect. It makes the opposite claim to what is physically true. A uniform pore structure with straight streamlines (Medium I) minimizes inertial effects by reducing both tortuosity and form drag. A heterogeneous network with tortuous paths and abrupt area changes (Medium II) maximizes these effects. Therefore, Medium I will have a smaller $\\beta$.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. $\\beta$ depends only on fluid properties, so it is identical for both media when the same fluid flows at the same $\\langle v \\rangle$.**\nThis statement is fundamentally incorrect. The Forchheimer coefficient $\\beta$ is a property of the porous medium's geometry, not the fluid. While the total inertial pressure drop, $\\rho \\beta \\langle v \\rangle^2$, depends on the fluid density $\\rho$ and velocity $\\langle v \\rangle$, the coefficient $\\beta$ itself is considered a constant for a given rigid porous structure. Since the two media have different pore-scale geometries, they are expected to have different $\\beta$ values.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2489001"}, {"introduction": "While conceptual understanding is crucial, practical application requires concrete models for the permeability $K$ and the Forchheimer coefficient $\\beta$.

We are tasked with finding expressions for the permeability $K$ and the inertial resistance coefficient $\\beta$ by equating two representations of the pressure gradient in a packed bed.\n\nThe first representation is the macroscopic Darcy-Forchheimer equation for one-dimensional flow along an axis, say $x$.

For unidirectional flow with a positive superficial velocity magnitude $u_s$, the equation simplifies to:\n$$-\\frac{d\\langle p \\rangle}{dx} = \\frac{\\mu}{K} u_s + \\beta \\rho u_s^2$$\nThis equation separates the pressure drop into a linear viscous contribution (the Darcy term) and a quadratic inertial contribution (the Forchheimer term).

This relation is the well-known Ergun equation. The quantity $\\frac{\\Delta p}{L}$ is physically identical to the magnitude of the macroscopic pressure gradient, $-\\frac{d\\langle p \\rangle}{dx}$.

The constants $150$ and $1.75$ are empirically determined factors.\n\nTo find $K$ and $\\beta$, we equate the two expressions for $-\\frac{d\\langle p \\rangle}{dx}$, as they must be equivalent descriptions of the same physical system:\n$$ \\frac{\\mu}{K} u_s + \\beta \\rho u_s^2 = \\left( 150 \\frac{(1-\\varepsilon)^2}{\\varepsilon^3} \\frac{\\mu}{d_p^2} \\right) u_s + \\left( 1.75 \\frac{(1-\\varepsilon)}{\\varepsilon^3} \\frac{\\rho}{d_p} \\right) u_s^2 $$\nThis identity must hold for any value of $u_s$ in the applicable range.

All necessary parameters are provided, and the required numerical method is well-defined. Therefore, the problem is valid, and a solution will be provided.\n\nThe fundamental principle is the macroscopic momentum balance for steady flow through the porous slab. The problem states that the pressure gradient, which drives the flow, is balanced by the drag forces exerted by the porous matrix on the fluid. In one dimension, with velocity $u$ aligned with the positive $x$-axis, the pressure gradient is $-\\frac{dp}{dx}$. For a homogeneous medium of thickness $L$ and a total pressure drop $\\Delta p = p_{\\text{in}} - p_{\\text{out}}$, this gradient is constant and equals $\\frac{\\Delta p}{L}$.\n\nThe total drag consists of a viscous (linear) term and an inertial (quadratic) term.\nThe viscous drag, corresponding to Darcy's law, is given by $\\frac{\\mu}{K} u$, where $\\mu$ is the dynamic viscosity and $K$ is the intrinsic permeability.\nThe inertial drag, described by the Forchheimer extension, is given by $\\rho \\beta |u| u$, where $\\rho$ is the fluid density and $\\beta$ is the inertial coefficient (also known as the non-Darcy factor or passability).

The gradient of the merit function is $\\nabla m(u) = r(u) r'(u)$.

The final velocity for each case is then rounded to six decimal places as required.", "answer": "```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Main function to solve the Forchheimer flow problem for a suite of test cases.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Test cases: (rho, mu, K, beta, L, delta_p)\n    # Units: (kg/m^3, Pa.s, m^2, m^-1, m, Pa)\n    test_cases = [\n        (1000.0, 1.0e-3, 1.0e-9, 1.0e4, 0.1, 1.0e5),\n        (1000.0, 1.0e-3, 1.0e-9, 1.0e4, 0.1, 100.0),\n        (1.2, 1.8e-5, 1.0e-10, 5.0e4, 0.05, 1000.0),\n        (1000.0, 1.0e-3, 1.0e-9, 1.0e4, 0.1, -1.0e5),\n        (1000.0, 1.0e-3, 1.0e-9, 1.0e4, 0.1, 0.0),\n    ]\n\n    results = []\n    for case in test_cases:\n        u_final = solve_forchheimer_case(*case)\n        # Format the result to exactly six decimal places\n        results.append(f\"{u_final:.6f}\")\n    \n    # Print the final output in the required format\n    print(f\"[{','.join(results)}]\")\n\ndef solve_forchheimer_case(rho, mu, k, beta, L, delta_p):\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves the 1D steady Forchheimer equation for superficial velocity u\n    using Newton-Raphson with a backtracking line search.\n\n    Equation: (mu/K)*u + rho*beta*|u|*u - delta_p/L = 0\n    \"\"\"\n    # Trivial case: no pressure drop means no flow\n    if delta_p == 0.0:\n        return 0.0\n\n    # Numerical solver parameters\n    max_iter = 50          # Maximum iterations for Newton's method\n    max_ls_iter = 10       # Maximum iterations for line search\n    c1 = 1e-4              # Armijo condition parameter\n    tau = 0.5              # Backtracking factor\n    tol_res_rel = 1e-10    # Relative tolerance on the residual\n    tol_upd_abs = 1e-12    # Absolute tolerance on the update step\n    tol_upd_rel = 1e-10    # Relative tolerance on the update step\n\n    # Pre-calculate coefficients for the residual function r(u) = B*u + A*|u|*u - C\n    # This avoids repeated calculations inside the loop.\n    A = rho * beta\n    B = mu / k\n    C = delta_p / L\n\n    # Define the residual function and its derivative\n    def r(u):\n        return B * u + A * np.abs(u) * u - C\n\n    def dr_du(u):\n        return B + 2.0 * A * np.abs(u)\n\n    # Initial guess: Darcy velocity (solution when inertial term is zero)\n    u_k = C / B\n    \n    for i in range(max_iter):\n        res_k = r(u_k)\n        \n        # Check for convergence based on the residual\n        # The tolerance is scaled by the driving pressure gradient\n        if np.abs(res_k) <= tol_res_rel * np.abs(C):\n            return u_k\n\n        dr_k = dr_du(u_k)\n        \n        # The derivative dr_k is always positive for the given physical constraints\n        # so no check for zero division is necessary.\n        delta_u = -res_k / dr_k\n\n        # --- Backtracking line search with Armijo condition ---\n        alpha = 1.0\n        m_k = 0.5 * res_k**2\n        \n        for j in range(max_ls_iter):\n            u_trial = u_k + alpha * delta_u\n            res_trial = r(u_trial)\n            m_trial = 0.5 * res_trial**2\n            \n            # Armijo condition: check for sufficient decrease in the merit function\n            if m_trial <= m_k - c1 * alpha * res_k**2:\n                break  # Step length alpha is acceptable\n            \n            # Reduce step length if condition is not met\n            alpha *= tau\n        else:\n            # Line search failed to find a suitable step, exit main loop\n            break\n\n        update_step = alpha * delta_u\n        u_k += update_step\n\n        # Check for convergence based on the update step size\n        if np.abs(update_step) <= tol_upd_abs + tol_upd_rel * np.abs(u_k):\n            return u_k\n\n    # If the loop completes without converging, return the last computed value.\n    # For a robust industrial code, an exception would be raised here.\n    return u_k\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    solve()\n```", "id": "2488962"}]}
