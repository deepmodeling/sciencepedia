It is scientifically sound, objective, and contains all necessary information for its resolution. Thus, it is deemed valid, and a solution is provided below.\n\nThe derivation of the intrinsic permeability, $K$, is based on a bridge between the macroscopic description of flow (Darcy's Law) and a microscopic model of the porous medium (the Kozeny-Carman model), which is itself founded on a mechanical energy balance and geometric considerations.\n\nFirst, we state Darcy's law for one-dimensional, steady, incompressible flow through a porous medium. This law defines the intrinsic permeability $K$ as the constant of proportionality relating the superficial velocity $v_s$ (volumetric flux) to the gradient of the piezometric pressure, $P = p + \\rho g z$, and the fluid's dynamic viscosity $\\mu$:\n$$v_s = -\\frac{K}{\\mu}\\frac{dP}{dx}$$\nRearranging for the pressure gradient, we have:\n$$\\left(-\\frac{dP}{dx}\\right) = \\frac{\\mu v_s}{K}$$\nThe rate of mechanical energy dissipation due to viscous forces per unit bulk volume of the porous medium is given by the product of the driving force (per unit volume) and the superficial velocity:\n$$P_{diss, macro} = \\left(-\\frac{dP}{dx}\\right) v_s = \\frac{\\mu v_s^2}{K}$$\n\nNext, we adopt a microscopic viewpoint. The Kozeny-Carman model idealizes the complex pore space of the packed bed as a bundle of tortuous, non-circular capillary tubes. The mechanical energy balance dictates that the macroscopic dissipation must equal the sum of viscous dissipation occurring within these microscopic pores. For creeping flow in a conduit, the pressure drop is related to the viscous shear at the solid-fluid interface. This relationship can be expressed using the concept of a hydraulic radius, $r_H$.\n\nThe pressure gradient along a single tortuous pore channel of effective length $L_{eff}$ is given by:\n$$\\left(-\\frac{dP}{dx_{eff}}\\right) = \\frac{\\Delta P}{L_{eff}} = k_0 \\frac{\\mu v_p}{r_H^2}$$\nwhere $v_p$ is the average interstitial velocity (the actual velocity of the fluid in the pores) and $k_0$ is a dimensionless shape factor that corrects for the non-circular cross-section of the pores.\n\nThe macroscopic pressure gradient is related to the pore-level gradient through the tortuosity, $\\tau = L_{eff}/L > 1$, which accounts for the fact that the fluid follows a longer, winding path through the medium of length $L$.\n$$\\left(-\\frac{dP}{dx}\\right) = \\tau \\left(-\\frac{dP}{dx_{eff}}\\right) = \\tau k_0 \\frac{\\mu v_p}{r_H^2}$$\nThe interstitial velocity $v_p$ is related to the superficial velocity $v_s$ by the bulk porosity $\\phi$: the total flux is $v_s A$, while the flux through the pores is $v_p A_p$, where $A_p = \\phi A$ is the area available for flow. Thus, $v_s A = (\\phi A) v_p$, which implies $v_p = v_s/\\phi$.\nSubstituting for $v_p$:\n$$\\left(-\\frac{dP}{dx}\\right) = \\frac{\\tau k_0 \\mu v_s}{\\phi r_H^2}$$\n\nThe third required element is the geometry of the packing. The hydraulic radius $r_H$ is defined as the ratio of the volume available for flow to the wetted surface area. In a bulk volume $V_b$, the flow volume is the pore volume $V_{pore} = \\phi V_b$, and the wetted surface is the total surface area of the solid particles, $A_{solid}$.\n$$r_H = \\frac{V_{pore}}{A_{solid}} = \\frac{\\phi V_b}{A_{solid}}$$\nThe term $a = A_{solid}/V_b$ is the interfacial area per unit bulk volume of the packing, which the problem requires us to identify. For a packing of identical, nonporous spheres of diameter $d_p$, we can calculate $a$. The volume of solids in $V_b$ is $V_{solid} = (1-\\phi)V_b$. The number of particles is $N_p = V_{solid} / V_{particle}$.\n$$a = \\frac{A_{solid}}{V_b} = \\frac{N_p A_{particle}}{V_b} = \\frac{(V_{solid} / V_{particle}) A_{particle}}{V_b} = \\frac{V_{solid}}{V_b} \\frac{A_{particle}}{V_{particle}}$$\n$$a = (1-\\phi) \\frac{\\pi d_p^2}{(\\frac{1}{6})\\pi d_p^3} = \\frac{6(1-\\phi)}{d_p}$$\nThis is the expression for the interfacial area per unit bulk volume. Now, we find the hydraulic radius:\n$$r_H = \\frac{\\phi}{a} = \\frac{\\phi d_p}{6(1-\\phi)}$$\n\nWe now substitute this expression for $r_H$ into the microscopic pressure drop equation:\n$$\\left(-\\frac{dP}{dx}\\right) = \\frac{\\tau k_0 \\mu v_s}{\\phi \\left( \\frac{\\phi d_p}{6(1-\\phi)} \\right)^2} = \\frac{36 (\\tau k_0) (1-\\phi)^2 \\mu v_s}{\\phi^3 d_p^2}$$\nThe problem instructs to use the Kozeny constant $c=5$. In this formulation, the Kozeny constant is the product of the tortuosity and shape factors, $c = \\tau k_0$.\n$$\\left(-\\frac{dP}{dx}\\right) = \\frac{36 c (1-\\phi)^2 \\mu v_s}{\\phi^3 d_p^2}$$\nFinally, we equate the macroscopic expression from Darcy's law with this microscopic result:\n$$\\frac{\\mu v_s}{K} = \\frac{36 c (1-\\phi)^2 \\mu v_s}{\\phi^3 d_p^2}$$\nSolving for the intrinsic permeability $K$, we obtain the Kozeny-Carman equation:\n$$K = \\frac{\\phi^3 d_p^2}{36 c (1-\\phi)^2}$$\nThis is the derived expression for the intrinsic permeability.\n\nNow, we evaluate $K$ for the given parameters: $d_p = 2.50 \\times 10^{-3}\\ \\mathrm{m}$, $\\phi = 0.40$, and $c=5$.\n$$K = \\frac{(0.40)^{3} (2.50 \\times 10^{-3})^2}{36 \\times 5 \\times (1 - 0.40)^2}$$\n$$K = \\frac{(0.064) \\times (6.25 \\times 10^{-6})}{180 \\times (0.60)^2}$$\n$$K = \\frac{4.0 \\times 10^{-7}}{180 \\times 0.36} = \\frac{4.0 \\times 10^{-7}}{64.8}$$\n$$K \\approx 6.1728... \\times 10^{-9}\\ \\mathrm{m}^2$$\nRounding to three significant figures, the result is $K = 6.17 \\times 10^{-9}\\ \\mathrm{m}^2$.\n\nThe physical regime and structural conditions under which this expression is applicable are as follows:\n1.  **Physical Regime:** The flow must be in the creeping-flow (viscous-dominated) regime, meaning the particle Reynolds number, typically defined as $Re_p = \\frac{d_p v_s \\rho}{\\mu(1-\\phi)}$, must be low, generally $Re_p  10$. The fluid must be Newtonian and incompressible, and the flow must be steady.\n2.  **Structural Conditions:** The porous medium must be a homogeneous, isotropic, unconsolidated bed of identical (monodisperse), rigid, nonporous, spherical particles. The value of the Kozeny constant $c=5$ (corresponding to $36c=180$ in the denominator) is empirically determined for such random packings. The formula's accuracy diminishes at the extremes of porosity (near $\\phi=1$ or near the jamming limit $\\phi \\approx 0.36$).", "answer": "$$\\boxed{6.17 \\times 10^{-9}}$$", "id": "2473721"}, {"introduction": "While Darcy's law accurately describes flow deep within a porous medium, it cannot satisfy the no-slip condition at an impermeable boundary.

It is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. We shall proceed with its formal solution.\n\nThe governing equation for steady, inertia-less flow in a porous medium, accounting for both Darcy drag and viscous stress diffusion, is the Brinkman equation. In the absence of body forces, it is stated as:\n$$\n0 = -\\nabla p - \\frac{\\mu}{K} \\mathbf{v} + \\mu_{e} \\nabla^2 \\mathbf{v}\n$$\nwhere $p$ is the pressure, $\\mathbf{v}$ is the macroscopic (Darcy) velocity vector, $\\mu$ is the fluid viscosity, $K$ is the permeability of the porous medium, and $\\mu_{e}$ is the effective viscosity.\n\nFor the specified problem, the flow is one-dimensional and fully developed, with the velocity vector having only one non-zero component, $\\mathbf{v} = (v(y), 0, 0)$. The pressure gradient is constant and directed along the $x$-axis, $\\nabla p = (\\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial x}, 0, 0)$, where $\\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial x}$ is a constant. Under these conditions, the vector equation reduces to a single scalar differential equation for the $x$-component of momentum:\n$$\n0 = -\\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial x} - \\frac{\\mu}{K} v(y) + \\mu_{e} \\frac{d^2 v}{d y^2}\n$$\nRearranging this equation into the standard form for a second-order linear ordinary differential equation (ODE) yields:\n$$\n\\mu_{e} \\frac{d^2 v}{d y^2} - \\frac{\\mu}{K} v(y) = \\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial x}\n$$\nDivision by $\\mu_{e}$ gives:\n$$\n\\frac{d^2 v}{d y^2} - \\frac{\\mu}{\\mu_{e} K} v(y) = \\frac{1}{\\mu_{e}} \\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial x}\n$$\nLet us define a parameter $\\alpha^2 = \\frac{\\mu_{e} K}{\\mu}$.

The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution, $v_h(y)$, and a particular solution, $v_p(y)$.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is $\\frac{d^2 v_h}{d y^2} - \\frac{1}{\\alpha^2} v_h(y) = 0$. The characteristic equation is $r^2 - \\frac{1}{\\alpha^2} = 0$, which has roots $r = \\pm \\frac{1}{\\alpha}$.

The problem possesses geometric and physical symmetry about the plane $y=0$. The velocity profile $v(y)$ must be an even function of $y$. Since $\\sinh(y/\\alpha)$ is an odd function, its coefficient must be zero, so $C_2=0$.

Therefore, the outlet temperature without generation is:\n$$\nT_{\\text{no-gen}}(L) = T_{\\text{in}}\n$$\nThe outlet temperature rise relative to the no-generation baseline, $\\Delta T_{\\text{out}}$, is defined as:\n$$\n\\Delta T_{\\text{out}} \\equiv T(L) - T_{\\text{no-gen}}(L) = \\left(T_{\\text{in}} + \\frac{q'''L}{\\rho_f u_x c_{p,f}}\\right) - T_{\\text{in}}\n$$\n$$\n\\Delta T_{\\text{out}} = \\frac{q'''L}{\\rho_f u_x c_{p,f}}\n$$\nFinally, we substitute the expression for the Darcy velocity $u_x = \\frac{K \\Delta P}{\\mu L}$ into this equation to express the result in terms of the required parameters:\n$$\n\\Delta T_{\\text{out}} = \\frac{q'''L}{\\rho_f c_{p,f} \\left(\\frac{K \\Delta P}{\\mu L}\\right)}\n$$\nSimplifying this expression yields the final closed-form result:\n$$\n\\Delta T_{\\text{out}} = \\frac{q''' L^2 \\mu}{\\rho_f c_{p,f} K \\Delta P}\n$$", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\frac{q''' L^2 \\mu}{\\rho_f c_{p,f} K \\Delta P}}\n$$", "id": "2473746"}]}
