Derivation of Knudsen Diffusivity $D_K$ in a Single Pore**\n\nThe analysis begins with the definition of molar flux.

The objective is to derive an expression for $J_z$ from kinetic theory and thereby identify $D_K$.\n\nIn the Knudsen regime, intermolecular collisions are negligible, and transport is governed by molecule-wall collisions. For a dilute gas in an isothermal system at temperature $T$, the ideal gas law in terms of molar concentration $C$ is $P = CRT$, where $P$ is the pressure and $R$ is the universal gas constant. The pressure gradient is thus related to the concentration gradient by:\n$$\n\\frac{dP}{dz} = R T \\frac{dC}{dz}\n$$\nThe molar flow rate, $\\dot{n}$, through a long, straight cylindrical tube of radius $r_p$ under a pressure gradient is given by the kinetic theory formulation for free-molecular flow:\n$$\n\\dot{n} = -\\frac{2 \\pi r_p^3}{3 R T} \\bar{v} \\frac{dP}{dz}\n$$\nwhere $\\bar{v}$ is the mean thermal speed of the molecules.

The problem is a valid exercise in applying fundamental principles.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is deemed **valid**. A solution will be derived.\n\n**Derivation of Solution**\nThe transport of gases through the nanoporous membrane is stated to be in the Knudsen regime. This regime is characterized by a Knudsen number $Kn = \\lambda/d \\gg 1$, where $\\lambda$ is the molecular mean free path and $d$ is the characteristic pore dimension, here the pore diameter $2r_p$. In this limit, molecule-wall collisions are far more frequent than molecule-molecule collisions, and thus transport is governed by the interaction of gas molecules with the pore walls.\n\nThe flux of a species $i$ through a porous medium is described by Fick's law, where the effective diffusivity $D_{i,\\mathrm{eff}}$ is used. The effective Knudsen diffusivity, $D_{K,\\mathrm{eff}}$, is related to the Knudsen diffusivity within a single pore, $D_K$, by incorporating the structural properties of the porous medium, specifically the porosity $\\varepsilon$ and the tortuosity $\\tau$:\n$$\nD_{K,\\mathrm{eff}} = \\frac{\\varepsilon}{\\tau} D_K\n$$\nThe parameters $\\varepsilon$ and $\\tau$ are properties of the porous solid and are assumed to be identical for the experiments with Helium and Nitrogen. Consequently, the ratio of the effective diffusivities for a given medium is identical to the ratio of the single-pore diffusivities:\n$$\n\\frac{D_{K,\\text{eff,He}}}{D_{K,\\text{eff,N}_2}} = \\frac{(\\varepsilon/\\tau) D_{K,\\text{He}}}{(\\varepsilon/\\tau) D_{K,\\text{N}_2}} = \\frac{D_{K,\\text{He}}}{D_{K,\\text{N}_2}}\n$$\nWe must therefore determine the dependence of the single-pore Knudsen diffusivity $D_K$ on molecular properties. For a long, straight, cylindrical pore of radius $r_p$, a rigorous kinetic theory analysis yields the following expression for $D_K$:\n$$\nD_K = \\frac{2}{3} r_p \\bar{v}\n$$\nwhere $\\bar{v}$ is the mean thermal speed of the gas molecules. The other geometric parameters provided, such as membrane thickness $L$, are irrelevant for determining the scaling law and the final ratio.\n\nThe mean thermal speed $\\bar{v}$ is a fundamental result from the kinetic theory of ideal gases, derived from the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution of molecular speeds. It is given by:\n$$\n\\bar{v} = \\sqrt{\\frac{8 k_B T}{\\pi m}}\n$$\nwhere $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant, $T$ is the absolute temperature, and $m$ is the mass of a single molecule.\n\nThe molecular mass $m$ is related to the molar mass $M$ through Avogadro's number, $N_A$, as $m = M/N_A$. Substituting this into the expression for $\\bar{v}$ yields:\n$$\n\\bar{v} = \\sqrt{\\frac{8 k_B N_A T}{\\pi M}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{8 R T}{\\pi M}}\n$$\nwhere $R = k_B N_A$ is the universal gas constant.\n\nNow, we substitute this expression for $\\bar{v}$ into the formula for $D_K$:\n$$\nD_K = \\frac{2}{3} r_p \\sqrt{\\frac{8 R T}{\\pi M}}\n$$\nThis expression reveals the dependence of the Knudsen diffusivity on the molar mass $M$. For a fixed pore geometry ($r_p$, $\\varepsilon$, $\\tau$) and constant temperature $T$, all terms except $M$ are constant. Therefore, the effective Knudsen diffusivity scales with the inverse square root of the molar mass:\n$$\nD_{K,\\mathrm{eff}} \\propto D_K \\propto \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{M}}\n$$\nThis is the required scaling law. It is a specific application of Graham's Law.\n\nUsing this scaling relationship, we can now compute the ratio of the effective Knudsen diffusivities for Helium and Nitrogen.\n$$\n\\frac{D_{K,\\text{eff,He}}}{D_{K,\\text{eff,N}_2}} = \\frac{\\frac{2 \\varepsilon r_p}{3 \\tau} \\sqrt{\\frac{8 R T}{\\pi M_{\\text{He}}}}}{\\frac{2 \\varepsilon r_p}{3 \\tau} \\sqrt{\\frac{8 R T}{\\pi M_{\\text{N}_2}}}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{M_{\\text{N}_2}}{M_{\\text{He}}}}\n$$\nThe problem provides the molar masses $M_{\\text{He}} = 4.0026 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{kg/mol}$ and $M_{\\text{N}_2} = 28.0134 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{kg/mol}$.
