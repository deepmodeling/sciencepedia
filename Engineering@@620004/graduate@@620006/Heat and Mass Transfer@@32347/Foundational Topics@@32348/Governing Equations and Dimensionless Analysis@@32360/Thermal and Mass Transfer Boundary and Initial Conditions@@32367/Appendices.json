It is a canonical, well-posed initial-boundary value problem in mathematical physics describing heat conduction in a finite one-dimensional domain. The assumptions are standard idealizations, and the tasks require rigorous derivation and analysis based on established principles of conservation laws, Fourier analysis, and partial differential equations. No flaws are identified. We proceed with the solution.\n\nTask 1: Derivation of the governing Partial Differential Equation (PDE) and identification of thermal diffusivity $\\alpha$.\n\nWe begin with the principle of conservation of energy applied to an arbitrary control volume of the rod. Let the rod have a uniform cross-sectional area $A$. Consider a segment of the rod from position $x$ to $x+\\Delta x$. The rate of change of thermal energy within this volume is given by the time derivative of the total energy content:\n$$ \\frac{dE}{dt} = \\frac{d}{dt} \\int_{x}^{x+\\Delta x} \\rho A c_p u(x',t) \\,dx' $$\nHere, $\\rho$ is the density, $c_p$ is the specific heat, and $u(x,t)$ is the temperature field. Since $\\rho$, $c_p$, and $A$ are constants, we can move the time derivative inside the integral, as the limits of integration do not depend on time:\n$$ \\frac{dE}{dt} = \\rho c_p A \\int_{x}^{x+\\Delta x} \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t} \\,dx' $$\nThis change in energy must be balanced by the net heat flow into the volume. Let $q(x,t)$ be the heat flux (energy per unit area per unit time) in the positive $x$ direction. The rate of heat entering the volume at $x$ is $A q(x,t)$, and the rate of heat leaving at $x+\\Delta x$ is $A q(x+\\Delta x, t)$. The net rate of heat transfer into the volume is:\n$$ Q_{net} = A q(x,t) - A q(x+\\Delta x, t) $$\nEquating the rate of energy change with the net heat flow (conservation of energy):\n$$ \\rho c_p A \\int_{x}^{x+\\Delta x} \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t} \\,dx' = A q(x,t) - A q(x+\\Delta x, t) $$\nDividing by $A \\Delta x$ and rearranging gives:\n$$ \\rho c_p \\frac{1}{\\Delta x} \\int_{x}^{x+\\Delta x} \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t} \\,dx' = - \\frac{q(x+\\Delta x, t) - q(x,t)}{\\Delta x} $$\nTaking the limit as $\\Delta x \\to 0$, the left side becomes $\\rho c_p \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t}$ by the Mean Value Theorem for integrals, and the right side becomes $-\\frac{\\partial q}{\\partial x}$ by the definition of the partial derivative. This yields the one-dimensional energy conservation equation in differential form:\n$$ \\rho c_p \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t} = - \\frac{\\partial q}{\\partial x} $$\nNext, we invoke Fourier's law of heat conduction, which relates the heat flux to the temperature gradient. For an isotropic material, this is:\n$$ q(x,t) = -k \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x} $$\nwhere $k$ is the thermal conductivity, a positive constant. Substituting Fourier's law into the energy equation gives:\n$$ \\rho c_p \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t} = - \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} \\left(-k \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x}\\right) $$\nSince $k$ is constant, we obtain:\n$$ \\rho c_p \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t} = k \\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial x^2} $$\nFinally, we rearrange this into the standard form of the heat equation:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t} = \\frac{k}{\\rho c_p} \\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial x^2} $$\nThe governing PDE is the one-dimensional heat equation. The coefficient $\\frac{k}{\\rho c_p}$ is defined as the thermal diffusivity, denoted by $\\alpha$.\n$$ \\alpha \\equiv \\frac{k}{\\rho c_p} $$\nThus, the governing equation is $\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t} = \\alpha \\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial x^2}$.\n\nTask 2: Characterization of eigenfunctions and eigenvalues.\n\nWe use the method of separation of variables, assuming a solution of the form $u(x,t) = X(x)\\Theta(t)$. Substituting this into the heat equation:\n$$ X(x)\\Theta'(t) = \\alpha X''(x)\\Theta(t) $$\nSeparating the variables yields:\n$$ \\frac{\\Theta'(t)}{\\alpha \\Theta(t)} = \\frac{X''(x)}{X(x)} = -s $$\nwhere $-s$ is the separation constant. This gives two ordinary differential equations. The spatial equation, subject to the given boundary conditions, forms a Sturm-Liouville problem:\n$$ X''(x) + s X(x) = 0 $$\nwith boundary conditions $u(0,t) = X(0)\\Theta(t) = 0$ and $u(L,t) = X(L)\\Theta(t) = 0$. For a non-trivial solution $\\Theta(t) \\not\\equiv 0$, we must have $X(0)=0$ and $X(L)=0$.\nWe analyze the cases for the separation constant $s$:\nCase 1: $s=0$. Then $X''(x) = 0$, so $X(x) = C_1 x + C_2$. Applying the boundary conditions: $X(0) = C_2 = 0$, and $X(L) = C_1 L = 0 \\implies C_1 = 0$. This gives only the trivial solution $X(x)=0$.\nCase 2: $s < 0$. Let $s = -\\lambda^2$ where $\\lambda > 0$. Then $X''(x) - \\lambda^2 X(x) = 0$. The general solution is $X(x) = C_1 \\cosh(\\lambda x) + C_2 \\sinh(\\lambda x)$. Applying the boundary conditions: $X(0) = C_1 = 0$, so $X(x) = C_2 \\sinh(\\lambda x)$. Then $X(L) = C_2 \\sinh(\\lambda L) = 0$. Since $\\lambda L > 0$, $\\sinh(\\lambda L) \\neq 0$, so we must have $C_2 = 0$. Again, only the trivial solution is found.\nCase 3: $s > 0$. Let $s = \\lambda^2$ where $\\lambda > 0$. Then $X''(x) + \\lambda^2 X(x) = 0$. The general solution is $X(x) = C_1 \\cos(\\lambda x) + C_2 \\sin(\\lambda x)$. Applying the boundary conditions: $X(0) = C_1 \\cos(0) + C_2 \\sin(0) = C_1 = 0$. The solution becomes $X(x) = C_2 \\sin(\\lambda x)$. Applying the second boundary condition: $X(L) = C_2 \\sin(\\lambda L) = 0$. To obtain a non-trivial solution ($C_2 \\neq 0$), we require $\\sin(\\lambda L) = 0$. This condition is met if $\\lambda L = n\\pi$ for any integer $n$. We take $n = 1, 2, 3, \\ldots$ since $n=0$ gives the trivial solution and negative integers produce redundant eigenfunctions ($\\sin(-z) = -\\sin(z)$).\nThis quantizes the possible values of $\\lambda$:\n$$ \\lambda_n = \\frac{n\\pi}{L}, \\quad n = 1, 2, 3, \\ldots $$\nThe eigenvalues of the spatial operator $d^2/dx^2$ (with the given boundary conditions) are the values $-s_n = -\\lambda_n^2$.\nEigenvalues: $-\\left(\\frac{n\\pi}{L}\\right)^2$ for $n=1,2,3,\\ldots$.\nThe corresponding eigenfunctions are, up to a normalization constant:\nEigenfunctions: $X_n(x) = \\sin\\left(\\frac{n\\pi x}{L}\\right)$ for $n=1,2,3,\\ldots$.\n\nTask 3: Eigenfunction expansion and Fourier coefficients.\n\nThe temporal equation is $\\Theta'(t) + \\alpha \\lambda_n^2 \\Theta(t) = 0$, which has the solution $\\Theta_n(t) = a_n \\exp(-\\alpha \\lambda_n^2 t)$, where $a_n$ is a constant. The general solution $u(x,t)$ is a superposition of all possible product solutions:\n$$ u(x,t) = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} X_n(x) \\Theta_n(t) = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} a_n \\sin\\left(\\frac{n\\pi x}{L}\\right) \\exp\\left(-\\alpha \\left(\\frac{n\\pi}{L}\\right)^2 t\\right) $$\nTo find the coefficients $\\{a_n\\}$, we apply the initial condition $u(x,0) = T_0$ for $0 < x < L$:\n$$ u(x,0) = T_0 = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} a_n \\sin\\left(\\frac{n\\pi x}{L}\\right) $$\nThis is the Fourier sine series expansion of the constant function $f(x)=T_0$ on the interval $(0,L)$. We use the orthogonality of the sine eigenfunctions: $\\int_0^L \\sin\\left(\\frac{n\\pi x}{L}\\right) \\sin\\left(\\frac{m\\pi x}{L}\\right) dx = \\frac{L}{2} \\delta_{mn}$. Multiplying the series by $\\sin\\left(\\frac{m\\pi x}{L}\\right)$ and integrating from $x=0$ to $x=L$:\n$$ \\int_0^L T_0 \\sin\\left(\\frac{m\\pi x}{L}\\right) dx = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} a_n \\int_0^L \\sin\\left(\\frac{n\\pi x}{L}\\right) \\sin\\left(\\frac{m\\pi x}{L}\\right) dx $$\n$$ T_0 \\left[-\\frac{L}{m\\pi} \\cos\\left(\\frac{m\\pi x}{L}\\right)\\right]_0^L = a_m \\frac{L}{2} $$\n$$ T_0 \\left(-\\frac{L}{m\\pi}\\right) \\left(\\cos(m\\pi) - \\cos(0)\\right) = a_m \\frac{L}{2} $$\n$$ T_0 \\left(-\\frac{L}{m\\pi}\\right) \\left((-1)^m - 1\\right) = a_m \\frac{L}{2} $$\nSolving for $a_m$:\n$$ a_m = \\frac{2}{L} T_0 \\left(-\\frac{L}{m\\pi}\\right) \\left((-1)^m - 1\\right) = \\frac{2T_0}{m\\pi} \\left(1 - (-1)^m\\right) $$\nThis formula shows that if $m$ is even, $1 - (-1)^m = 0$, so $a_m = 0$. If $m$ is odd, $1 - (-1)^m = 2$, so $a_m = \\frac{4T_0}{m\\pi}$.\nThe dimensionless coefficients are $b_n \\equiv a_n/T_0$. Replacing $m$ with $n$ for the general term, we have:\n$$ b_n = \\frac{a_n}{T_0} = \\frac{2}{n\\pi} \\left(1 - (-1)^n\\right) $$\nThis single closed-form analytic expression is valid for all $n \\ge 1$.\n\nTask 4: Rigorous justification of boundary condition enforcement for $t > 0$.\n\nThe initial condition $u(x,0)=T_0$ for $x \\in (0,L)$ is discontinuous with the boundary conditions $u(0,t)=u(L,t)=0$ at the points $(0,0)$ and $(L,0)$. Consequently, the Fourier sine series for $u(x,0)$ does not converge uniformly on the closed interval $[0,L]$; it converges in the $L^2(0,L)$ sense.\n\nHowever, for any time $t > 0$, the situation is fundamentally different due to the \"smoothing effect\" of the heat equation. The solution is:\n$$ u(x,t) = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} a_n \\exp\\left(-\\alpha \\left(\\frac{n\\pi}{L}\\right)^2 t\\right) \\sin\\left(\\frac{n\\pi x}{L}\\right) $$\nLet the time-dependent coefficients be $C_n(t) = a_n \\exp\\left(-\\alpha \\left(\\frac{n\\pi}{L}\\right)^2 t\\right)$.\nThe Fourier coefficients $a_n$ are bounded, $|a_n| \\le \\frac{4T_0}{n\\pi}$, so they decay as $O(n^{-1})$. For $t=0$, this slow decay rate leads to the convergence issues.\nFor any fixed $t > 0$, the exponential term $\\exp(-\\alpha(\\frac{n\\pi}{L})^2 t)$ introduces a rapid, superpolynomial decay in $n$. Specifically, $|C_n(t)| \\le \\frac{4T_0}{n\\pi} \\exp(-\\text{const} \\cdot n^2 t)$. This exponential dampening factor dominates the algebraic growth of any polynomial in $n$ that would arise from differentiation.\nBy the Weierstrass M-test, the series for $u(x,t)$ converges absolutely and uniformly for $x \\in [0,L]$ for any fixed $t > 0$. The terms of the series are bounded by $|C_n(t) \\sin(\\frac{n\\pi x}{L})| \\le \\frac{4T_0}{n\\pi} \\exp(-\\alpha(\\frac{n\\pi}{L})^2 t)$. The sum of these bounds, $\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{4T_0}{n\\pi} \\exp(-\\alpha(\\frac{n\\pi}{L})^2 t)$, converges rapidly for any $t>0$.\nBecause the convergence is uniform on the entire closed domain $[0,L]$, the sum of the continuous functions is a continuous function. We can therefore evaluate the solution at the boundaries $x=0$ and $x=L$ by term-wise substitution:\n$$ u(0,t) = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} C_n(t) \\sin(0) = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} C_n(t) \\cdot 0 = 0 $$\n$$ u(L,t) = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} C_n(t) \\sin\\left(\\frac{n\\pi L}{L}\\right) = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} C_n(t) \\sin(n\\pi) = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} C_n(t) \\cdot 0 = 0 $$\nThis holds for all $t > 0$. The initial non-compliance at the boundaries is resolved instantaneously. The heat equation takes the non-smooth initial data and evolves it into a $C^\\infty$ (infinitely differentiable) function for all $t > 0$, which necessarily satisfies the boundary conditions in a pointwise manner. This smoothing property is a hallmark of parabolic partial differential equations.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\frac{2 \\left(1 - (-1)^n\\right)}{n\\pi}}\n$$"}, {"introduction": "Building on the previous exercise, this practice explores a different yet equally fundamental type of boundary condition: perfect insulation, or a zero-flux Neumann condition.

It is a valid problem in mathematical physics. A solution will be provided.\n\n**Derivation of the Governing Equation and Boundary Conditions**\nWe begin with the local conservation of energy. Consider an arbitrary infinitesimal control volume of the rod from $x$ to $x + \\Delta x$ with cross-sectional area $A$. The rate of change of internal energy within this volume is equal to the net rate of heat conducted into it.\nThe internal energy is $\\int_{x}^{x+\\Delta x} \\rho c_p T(x', t) A \\, dx'$. The rate of change is $\\frac{d}{dt} \\int_{x}^{x+\\Delta x} \\rho c_p T(x', t) A \\, dx'$.\nThe net heat flux is $q(x,t)A - q(x+\\Delta x, t)A$, where $q(x,t)$ is the heat flux in the positive $x$-direction.\nThe energy balance is:\n$$ \\frac{d}{dt} \\int_{x}^{x+\\Delta x} \\rho c_p T(x', t) A \\, dx' = A [q(x,t) - q(x+\\Delta x, t)] $$\nAssuming $\\rho$ and $c_p$ are constant, and dividing by $A \\Delta x$:\n$$ \\frac{1}{\\Delta x} \\int_{x}^{x+\\Delta x} \\rho c_p \\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial t}(x', t) \\, dx' = - \\frac{q(x+\\Delta x, t) - q(x,t)}{\\Delta x} $$\nTaking the limit as $\\Delta x \\to 0$, the left side becomes $\\rho c_p \\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial t}$ and the right side becomes $-\\frac{\\partial q}{\\partial x}$ by the definition of the derivative.\n$$ \\rho c_p \\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial t} = -\\frac{\\partial q}{\\partial x} $$\nWe now invoke Fourier's law of heat conduction, which states that the heat flux is proportional to the negative temperature gradient: $q = -k \\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial x}$. Substituting this into the energy conservation equation yields:\n$$ \\rho c_p \\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial t} = -\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} \\left(-k \\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial x}\\right) $$\nSince the thermal conductivity $k$ is constant, this simplifies to the one-dimensional heat equation:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial t} = \\frac{k}{\\rho c_p} \\frac{\\partial^2 T}{\\partial x^2} \\equiv \\alpha \\frac{\\partial^2 T}{\\partial x^2} $$\nwhere $\\alpha = k/(\\rho c_p)$ is the thermal diffusivity.\n\nThe boundary conditions are that both ends are perfectly insulated. This means the heat flux across the boundaries is zero.\nAt $x=0$, the outward normal is in the $-x$ direction, so the outward flux is $-q(0,t)$. Setting this to zero gives $q(0,t)=0$. From Fourier's law, $q(0,t) = -k\\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial x}\\Big|_{x=0}=0$, which implies $\\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial x}\\Big|_{x=0}=0$.\nAt $x=L$, the outward normal is in the $+x$ direction, so the outward flux is $q(L,t)$.

The equation becomes $X''(x) = 0$, with general solution $X(x) = c_1 x + c_2$. The derivative is $X'(x) = c_1$.\nApplying the boundary conditions:\n$X'(0) = c_1 = 0$.\n$X'(L) = c_1 = 0$.\nThese conditions require $c_1=0$, but $c_2$ is arbitrary. We have a non-trivial solution $X(x) = c_2$. We can choose $c_2=1$.\nThus, $\\lambda_0 = 0$ is an eigenvalue with corresponding eigenfunction $X_0(x) = 1$.\n\nCase 3: $\\lambda > 0$. Let $\\lambda = \\mu^2$ for $\\mu > 0$. The equation is $X''(x) + \\mu^2 X(x) = 0$, with general solution $X(x) = c_1 \\cos(\\mu x) + c_2 \\sin(\\mu x)$.

For this mode, the time equation is $\\Theta_0'(t) = 0$, whose solution is $\\Theta_0(t) = \\text{constant}$. For all other modes $n \\ge 1$, $\\lambda_n > 0$, and the time equation $\\Theta_n'(t) + \\alpha \\lambda_n \\Theta_n(t) = 0$ has solution $\\Theta_n(t) \\propto \\exp(-\\alpha \\lambda_n t)$. These modes decay exponentially with time. The zero-eigenvalue mode, however, does not decay. It represents a steady-state component of the temperature profile. The full solution is a superposition:\n$$ T(x,t) = C_0 + \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} C_n \\cos\\left(\\frac{n\\pi x}{L}\\right) \\exp\\left(-\\alpha \\left(\\frac{n\\pi}{L}\\right)^2 t\\right) $$\nThe persistence of the $C_0$ term reflects the physical conservation of energy in the insulated system.\n\n**Evolution of the Spatial Mean Temperature**\nWe define the spatial mean temperature as $\\overline{T}(t) = \\frac{1}{L}\\int_{0}^{L} T(x,t)\\,dx$. To find its evolution, we integrate the governing PDE over the domain $[0,L]$:\n$$ \\int_{0}^{L} \\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial t} \\,dx = \\int_{0}^{L} \\alpha \\frac{\\partial^2 T}{\\partial x^2} \\,dx $$\nApplying the Leibniz integral rule on the left hand side:\n$$ \\frac{d}{dt} \\int_{0}^{L} T(x,t) \\,dx = \\alpha \\left[ \\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial x} \\right]_{0}^{L} = \\alpha \\left( \\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial x}\\Big|_{x=L} - \\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial x}\\Big|_{x=0} \\right) $$\nUsing the adiabatic boundary conditions, $\\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial x}(0,t)=0$ and $\\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial x}(L,t)=0$, the right-hand side is zero.\n$$ \\frac{d}{dt} \\int_{0}^{L} T(x,t) \\,dx = 0 $$\nThis implies that the total thermal energy, proportional to $\\int_{0}^{L} T(x,t) \\,dx$, is conserved. Consequently, the spatial mean temperature is constant in time:\n$$ \\frac{d\\overline{T}}{dt} = \\frac{1}{L} \\frac{d}{dt} \\int_{0}^{L} T(x,t) \\,dx = 0 \\implies \\overline{T}(t) = \\overline{T}(0) = \\text{constant} $$\nNow, we relate this to the eigenfunction expansion. Taking the spatial average of the series solution:\n$$ \\overline{T}(t) = \\frac{1}{L} \\int_{0}^{L} \\left( C_0 + \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} C_n \\cos\\left(\\frac{n\\pi x}{L}\\right) \\exp\\left(-\\alpha \\lambda_n t\\right) \\right) dx $$\n$$ \\overline{T}(t) = \\frac{1}{L} \\int_{0}^{L} C_0 \\,dx + \\frac{1}{L} \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} C_n \\exp(-\\alpha \\lambda_n t) \\int_{0}^{L} \\cos\\left(\\frac{n\\pi x}{L}\\right) \\,dx $$\nThe first integral is $\\int_{0}^{L} C_0 \\,dx = C_0 L$. The second set of integrals are all zero for $n \\ge 1$:\n$$ \\int_{0}^{L} \\cos\\left(\\frac{n\\pi x}{L}\\right) \\,dx = \\left[\\frac{L}{n\\pi} \\sin\\left(\\frac{n\\pi x}{L}\\right)\\right]_0^L = 0 $$\nTherefore, the spatial mean temperature is simply $\\overline{T}(t) = \\frac{1}{L} (C_0 L) = C_0$. The coefficient of the zero-eigenvalue mode is exactly the conserved spatial mean temperature. This coefficient is determined by the initial condition:\n$$ C_0 = \\overline{T}(0) = \\frac{1}{L}\\int_{0}^{L} T(x,0)\\,dx = \\frac{1}{L}\\int_{0}^{L} T_0(x)\\,dx $$\n\n**Calculation for the Specific Initial Condition**\nThe problem asks for the conserved spatial mean temperature $\\overline{T}(t)$ for the initial condition $T_0(x) = T_b + B\\,x + C\\,\\cos\\!\\left(\\frac{3\\pi x}{L}\\right)$.\nAs established, $\\overline{T}(t)$ is constant and equal to its initial value $\\overline{T}(0)$.\n$$ \\overline{T}(t) = \\overline{T}(0) = \\frac{1}{L} \\int_0^L \\left( T_b + Bx + C\\cos\\left(\\frac{3\\pi x}{L}\\right) \\right) dx $$\nWe compute the integral term by term:\n$$ \\overline{T}(t) = \\frac{1}{L} \\left[ \\int_0^L T_b \\,dx + \\int_0^L Bx \\,dx + \\int_0^L C\\cos\\left(\\frac{3\\pi x}{L}\\right) \\,dx \\right] $$\n$$ \\int_0^L T_b \\,dx = T_b [x]_0^L = T_b L $$\n$$ \\int_0^L Bx \\,dx = B \\left[\\frac{x^2}{2}\\right]_0^L = \\frac{BL^2}{2} $$\n$$ \\int_0^L C\\cos\\left(\\frac{3\\pi x}{L}\\right) \\,dx = C \\left[\\frac{L}{3\\pi} \\sin\\left(\\frac{3\\pi x}{L}\\right)\\right]_0^L = C \\frac{L}{3\\pi} (\\sin(3\\pi) - \\sin(0)) = 0 $$\nSubstituting these results back:\n$$ \\overline{T}(t) = \\frac{1}{L} \\left( T_b L + \\frac{BL^2}{2} + 0 \\right) = T_b + \\frac{BL}{2} $$\nThis expression represents the mean temperature, which is constant for all $t \\ge 0$. The cosine term in the initial condition corresponds to the $n=3$ eigenmode, which decays to zero, while the linear term contributes to the mean temperature but also to other decaying modes. The constant term $T_b$ also contributes directly to the mean. The final result is independent of the coefficient $C$ and time $t$. The instruction that the answer should be in kelvin implies that the physical quantities $T_b$, $B$, and $L$ are given in a consistent set of units (e.g., SI) such that the final expression has units of temperature.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{T_b + \\frac{BL}{2}}$$"}, {"introduction": "Our final practice transitions from idealized analytical problems to a more realistic steady-state engineering scenario, where boundary phenomena are complex and nonlinear.

It is scientifically grounded, self-contained, and objective. We shall proceed with its formal derivation and solution.\n\nThe problem requires the derivation of the governing equation for temperature distribution in a one-dimensional planar wall, its boundary conditions, and the subsequent reduction to a single nonlinear equation for the surface temperature $T_s = T(L)$. We will then prove the existence and uniqueness of the solution and devise a numerical scheme for its computation.\n\n**Derivation of the Governing Equation and Boundary Conditions**\n\nWe begin from first principles.\n\n1.  **Differential Energy Balance:**\n    Consider a differential control volume element of planar area $A$ and thickness $\\Delta x$ within the wall, located at position $x$. For steady-state one-dimensional heat transfer, the energy balance is:\n    $$ \\dot{E}_{\\text{in}} - \\dot{E}_{\\text{out}} + \\dot{E}_{\\text{gen}} = 0 $$\n    where $\\dot{E}_{\\text{in}}$ is the rate of heat entering the control volume, $\\dot{E}_{\\text{out}}$ is the rate of heat leaving, and $\\dot{E}_{\\text{gen}}$ is the rate of heat generation within the volume.\n    Heat transfer occurs via conduction. Let $q_x''$ be the heat flux at position $x$. The energy balance becomes:\n    $$ q_x'' A - q_{x+\\Delta x}'' A + q^{\\prime\\prime\\prime} (A \\Delta x) = 0 $$\n    Dividing by the volume $A \\Delta x$ and taking the limit as $\\Delta x \\to 0$:\n    $$ -\\lim_{\\Delta x \\to 0} \\frac{q_{x+\\Delta x}'' - q_x''}{\\Delta x} + q^{\\prime\\prime\\prime} = 0 $$\n    This yields the differential form of the energy conservation equation:\n    $$ -\\frac{d q_x''}{dx} + q^{\\prime\\prime\\prime} = 0 $$\n\n2.  **Fourier's Law:**\n    According to Fourier's law of heat conduction, the heat flux $q_x''$ is proportional to the temperature gradient:\n    $$ q_x'' = -k \\frac{dT}{dx} $$\n    where $k$ is the thermal conductivity, assumed to be constant. Substituting this into the energy balance gives:\n    $$ -\\frac{d}{dx} \\left(-k \\frac{dT}{dx}\\right) + q^{\\prime\\prime\\prime} = 0 $$\n    $$ k \\frac{d^2 T}{dx^2} + q^{\\prime\\prime\\prime} = 0 $$\n    The governing ordinary differential equation for the temperature profile $T(x)$ is thus:\n    $$ \\frac{d^2 T}{dx^2} = -\\frac{q^{\\prime\\prime\\prime}}{k} $$\n\n3.  **Boundary Conditions:**\n    To solve this second-order ODE, two boundary conditions are required.\n    -   At the left face, $x=0$, a Dirichlet condition is specified:\n        $$ T(0) = T_0 $$\n    -   At the right face, $x=L$, a surface energy balance is performed. The heat conducted to the surface from the interior must equal the heat dissipated from the surface to the surroundings via convection and radiation.\n        $$ q_{\\text{cond}}''|_{x=L} = q_{\\text{conv}}'' + q_{\\text{rad}}'' $$\n        The conducted heat flux is $q_{\\text{cond}}''|_{x=L} = -k \\left. \\frac{dT}{dx} \\right|_{x=L}$.\n        The convective heat flux, by Newton's law of cooling, is $q_{\\text{conv}}'' = h(T(L) - T_\\infty)$, where $h$ is the convection coefficient and $T_\\infty$ is the fluid temperature.\n        The radiative heat flux, for a diffuse, gray surface to large surroundings, is $q_{\\text{rad}}'' = \\varepsilon \\sigma (T(L)^4 - T_{\\mathrm{sur}}^4)$, where $\\varepsilon$ is the surface emissivity, $\\sigma$ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant, and $T_{\\mathrm{sur}}$ is the temperature of the surroundings.\n        Letting $T_s = T(L)$, the boundary condition at $x=L$ is:\n        $$ -k \\left. \\frac{dT}{dx} \\right|_{x=L} = h(T_s - T_\\infty) + \\varepsilon \\sigma (T_s^4 - T_{\\mathrm{sur}}^4) $$\n        This is a nonlinear mixed (Robin) boundary condition, as it involves both the function $T_s$ and its derivative, and is nonlinear due to the $T_s^4$ term.\n\n**Reduction to a Scalar Equation for Surface Temperature $T_s$**\n\nWe solve the ODE to find the general temperature profile. Integrating the governing equation twice with respect to $x$:\n$$ \\frac{dT}{dx} = -\\frac{q^{\\prime\\prime\\prime}}{k} x + C_1 $$\n$$ T(x) = -\\frac{q^{\\prime\\prime\\prime}}{2k} x^2 + C_1 x + C_2 $$\nThe boundary condition at $x=0$, $T(0)=T_0$, yields $C_2 = T_0$. The profile is:\n$$ T(x) = -\\frac{q^{\\prime\\prime\\prime}}{2k} x^2 + C_1 x + T_0 $$\nThe surface temperature at $x=L$ is $T_s = T(L)$, so:\n$$ T_s = -\\frac{q^{\\prime\\prime\\prime} L^2}{2k} + C_1 L + T_0 $$\nFrom this, we express the constant $C_1$ in terms of $T_s$:\n$$ C_1 = \\frac{T_s - T_0}{L} + \\frac{q^{\\prime\\prime\\prime} L}{2k} $$\nThe temperature gradient at $x=L$ is:\n$$ \\left. \\frac{dT}{dx} \\right|_{x=L} = -\\frac{q^{\\prime\\prime\\prime} L}{k} + C_1 = -\\frac{q^{\\prime\\prime\\prime} L}{k} + \\left( \\frac{T_s - T_0}{L} + \\frac{q^{\\prime\\prime\\prime} L}{2k} \\right) = \\frac{T_s - T_0}{L} - \\frac{q^{\\prime\\prime\\prime} L}{2k} $$\nSubstituting this derivative into the Robin boundary condition at $x=L$:\n$$ -k \\left( \\frac{T_s - T_0}{L} - \\frac{q^{\\prime\\prime\\prime} L}{2k} \\right) = h(T_s - T_\\infty) + \\varepsilon \\sigma (T_s^4 - T_{\\mathrm{sur}}^4) $$\nSimplifying the left-hand side:\n$$ \\frac{k}{L}(T_0 - T_s) + \\frac{q^{\\prime\\prime\\prime} L}{2} = h(T_s - T_\\infty) + \\varepsilon \\sigma (T_s^4 - T_{\\mathrm{sur}}^4) $$\nThis equation relates the heat flux conducted to the surface, $\\frac{k}{L}(T_0 - T_s) + \\frac{q^{\\prime\\prime\\prime} L}{2}$, to the heat flux leaving the surface by convection and radiation. To solve for $T_s$, we define a residual function $R(T_s)$ and find its root:\n$$ R(T_s) = h(T_s - T_\\infty) + \\varepsilon \\sigma (T_s^4 - T_{\\mathrm{sur}}^4) + \\frac{k}{L}(T_s - T_0) - \\frac{q^{\\prime\\prime\\prime} L}{2} = 0 $$\nThis is the required single nonlinear scalar equation for the unknown surface temperature $T_s$.\n\n**Proof of Existence and Uniqueness**\n\nWe must prove that $R(T_s) = 0$ has a unique, physically meaningful solution $T_s \\ge 0$.\nThe function $R(T_s)$ is continuous for all $T_s \\ge 0$. To analyze its behavior, we compute its first derivative with respect to $T_s$:\n$$ R'(T_s) = \\frac{dR}{dT_s} = h + 4 \\varepsilon \\sigma T_s^3 + \\frac{k}{L} $$\nThe parameters are given as $L > 0$, $k > 0$, $h \\ge 0$, $\\varepsilon \\ge 0$, and $\\sigma > 0$. For any physically meaningful temperature $T_s \\ge 0$, each term in the expression for $R'(T_s)$ is non-negative. Specifically, $k/L > 0$. Therefore,\n$$ R'(T_s) = h + 4 \\varepsilon \\sigma T_s^3 + \\frac{k}{L} > 0 \\quad \\text{for all } T_s \\ge 0 $$\nSince the derivative is strictly positive, the function $R(T_s)$ is strictly monotonically increasing on the domain $[0, \\infty)$. A strictly monotonic function can cross the value zero at most once. This proves that if a solution exists, it is unique.\n\nTo prove existence, we apply the Intermediate Value Theorem. We examine the function at the boundaries of the domain.\n-   As $T_s \\to \\infty$, the term $\\varepsilon \\sigma T_s^4$ (if $\\varepsilon > 0$) or the term $(h + k/L)T_s$ (if $\\varepsilon=0$) dominates, causing $R(T_s) \\to \\infty$.\n-   At $T_s = 0$, the function value is:\n    $$ R(0) = -h T_\\infty - \\varepsilon \\sigma T_{\\mathrm{sur}}^4 - \\frac{k}{L} T_0 - \\frac{q^{\\prime\\prime\\prime} L}{2} $$\nFor a physically meaningful steady-state system where absolute temperatures ($T_0, T_\\infty, T_{\\mathrm{sur}}$) are non-negative, and heat generation $q^{\\prime\\prime\\prime}$ is not so intensely negative as to create a physically non-realizable scenario (i.e., requiring negative absolute temperatures to achieve steady state), we will have $R(0) \\le 0$. All provided test cases satisfy this condition.\nSince $R(T_s)$ is continuous, is non-positive at $T_s=0$, and tends to $+\\infty$ as $T_s \\to \\infty$, the Intermediate Value Theorem guarantees that there is at least one root $T_s \\in [0, \\infty)$.\nCombining this with the uniqueness from monotonicity, we conclude that there exists exactly one physically meaningful solution $T_s \\ge 0$ for the equation $R(T_s) = 0$.\n\n**Numerical Strategy**\n\nTo solve the nonlinear equation $R(T_s)=0$, we propose using the Newton-Raphson method. This iterative method is highly efficient for well-behaved functions for which the derivative is available. The iterative formula is:\n$$ T_{s, n+1} = T_{s, n} - \\frac{R(T_{s, n})}{R'(T_{s, n})} $$\nwhere $n$ is the iteration index.\n\nJustification:\n1.  **Fast Convergence:** Newton's method exhibits quadratic convergence when the initial guess is sufficiently close to the root, which is significantly faster than bracketing methods like bisection.\n2.  **Robustness for this problem:** We have shown that $R(T_s)$ is strictly monotonic and its second derivative, $R''(T_s) = 12 \\varepsilon \\sigma T_s^2$, is non-negative for $T_s \\ge 0$. This means $R(T_s)$ is a convex function on $[0, \\infty)$. For a convex function, Newton's method is guaranteed to converge monotonically to the unique root from any starting point $T_{s,0}$ greater than the root. Convergence is also robust for other starting points.\n3.  **Derivative Availability:** The analytical derivative $R'(T_s)$ is simple to compute and implement, making Newton's method straightforward to apply without resorting to numerical approximations like in the Secant method.\n4.  **Initial Guess:** A physically reasonable initial guess is the temperature at the other boundary, $T_s \\approx T_0$, or the ambient temperature $T_s \\approx T_\\infty$. Given the nature of the function, the choice is not critical for convergence, but a good guess reduces the number of iterations.
