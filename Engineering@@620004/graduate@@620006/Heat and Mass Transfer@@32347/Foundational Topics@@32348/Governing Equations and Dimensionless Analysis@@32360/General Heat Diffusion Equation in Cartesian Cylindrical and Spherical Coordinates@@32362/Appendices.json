The core principles are the local conservation of energy and Fourier's law of heat conduction.\n\nThe local conservation of energy, in its general integral form for a control volume $V$ with boundary $\\partial V$, is given by:\n$$ \\frac{d}{dt} \\int_V \\rho c_p T \\, dV = - \\int_{\\partial V} \\mathbf{q} \\cdot \\mathbf{n} \\, dA + \\int_V \\dot{q} \\, dV $$\nwhere $\\rho c_p$ is the volumetric heat capacity (assumed constant), $T$ is the temperature, $\\mathbf{q}$ is the heat flux vector, $\\mathbf{n}$ is the outward unit normal to the surface $\\partial V$, and $\\dot{q}$ is the volumetric heat generation rate.\n\nGiven the assumptions in the problem statement:\n1.  **Spherical Symmetry**: The temperature field is $T(\\mathbf{x}, t) = \\Theta(r, t)$, where $r = \\lVert \\mathbf{x} \\rVert$.\n2.  **Fourier's Law**: $\\mathbf{q} = -k \\nabla T$. In spherical coordinates, this becomes $\\mathbf{q}(r,t) = -k \\frac{\\partial \\Theta(r,t)}{\\partial r} \\mathbf{e}_r = q_r(r,t) \\mathbf{e}_r$.\n3.  **Boundedness**: The temperature $\\Theta(r,t)$ is bounded and differentiable for $r \\ge 0$. This implies its time derivative $\\partial_t \\Theta$ is also bounded near the origin. The heat generation rate $\\dot{q}(r,t)$ is also stated to be bounded in a neighborhood of $r=0$.\n\nWe can analyze the situation from several perspectives to derive the condition at $r=0$.\n\nA. **Analysis of Option A**: This option argues from the perspective of vector field continuity at a point of symmetry. The heat flux $\\mathbf{q}(r,t)$ is a vector field given by $q_r(r,t)\\mathbf{e}_r$. The unit radial vector $\\mathbf{e}_r = \\mathbf{x}/r$ is well-defined for any $\\mathbf{x} \\neq \\mathbf{0}$, but it is undefined at the origin $\\mathbf{x}=\\mathbf{0}$, as its direction depends on the path taken to approach the origin. For the vector field $\\mathbf{q}(\\mathbf{x},t)$ to be continuous and have a single, well-defined value at $\\mathbf{x}=\\mathbf{0}$, its limit as $\\mathbf{x} \\to \\mathbf{0}$ must exist and be independent of the path. If we approach the origin along the positive x-axis, $\\mathbf{e}_r = (1,0,0)$. If we approach along the negative x-axis, $\\mathbf{e}_r = (-1,0,0)$. For the limit $\\lim_{r\\to 0^+} q_r(r,t) \\mathbf{e}_r$ to be unique, the magnitude must vanish to cancel the ambiguity in direction. That is, the limit vector must be the zero vector, $\\mathbf{q}(0,t)=\\mathbf{0}$. This means $\\lim_{r \\to 0^+} q_r(r,t)=0$. As $q_r(r,t) = -k \\Theta_r(r,t)$ and $k$ is a non-zero constant, we must have $\\lim_{r \\to 0^+} \\Theta_r(r,t) = 0$. Since $\\Theta$ is differentiable at $r=0$, this limit is $\\Theta_r(0,t)$. So, $\\Theta_r(0,t)=0$. The reasoning is physically and mathematically sound, based on the requirement of a well-defined (continuous, single-valued) flux vector.\n**Verdict**: Correct.\n\nB. **Analysis of Option B**: This option uses the differential form of the energy balance. The divergence of the flux, $\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{q}$, in spherical coordinates for a field $\\mathbf{q} = q_r(r,t)\\mathbf{e}_r$ is $\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{q} = \\frac{1}{r^2}\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial r}(r^2 q_r)$. The differential energy balance is $\\rho c_p \\partial_t \\Theta = - \\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{q} + \\dot{q}$. All terms in this equation must be finite at every point, including the limit $r \\to 0^+$. The terms $\\rho c_p \\partial_t \\Theta$ and $\\dot{q}$ are bounded near $r=0$ by the problem's assumptions. Therefore, $\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{q}$ must also remain bounded as $r \\to 0^+$. Let us examine this term. Since $\\Theta(r,t)$ is differentiable for $r \\ge 0$, its derivative $\\Theta_r(r,t)$ is continuous for $r \\ge 0$. Thus, $q_r(r,t) = -k\\Theta_r(r,t)$ is also continuous and approaches a finite limit $q_r(0,t)$ as $r \\to 0^+$. Let's call this limit $q_0(t)$. For small $r$, $q_r(r,t) \\approx q_0(t)$. Then $r^2 q_r(r,t) \\approx q_0(t) r^2$. The derivative is $\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial r}(r^2 q_r) \\approx 2q_0(t)r$. Then the divergence is $\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{q} \\approx \\frac{1}{r^2}(2q_0(t)r) = \\frac{2q_0(t)}{r}$. If $q_0(t) \\neq 0$, this term diverges as $r \\to 0^+$. This would create an unbalanced singularity in the energy equation, as all other terms are bounded. This constitutes a physical contradiction; it would imply an infinite source or sink of energy at the origin, which is not supported by a bounded $\\dot{q}$. Therefore, to maintain a finite energy balance, we must have $q_0(t) = q_r(0,t) = 0$. This, in turn, implies $\\Theta_r(0,t)=0$. The logic is sound.\n**Verdict**: Correct.\n\nC. **Analysis of Option C**: This option considers the total heat rate through a sphere of radius $r$, which is correctly given as $4\\pi r^2 q_r(r,t)$. It then states that for this to remain finite as $r \\to 0^+$, one must have $q_r(r,t) \\sim \\mathcal{O}(1/r^2)$. This reasoning is flawed. The requirement is not merely that the total heat rate remains finite; it is that the physical laws are satisfied. The condition $q_r(r,t) \\sim \\mathcal{O}(1/r^2)$ would imply that $\\Theta_r(r,t) \\sim \\mathcal{O}(1/r^2)$, and integrating this gives $\\Theta(r,t) \\sim \\mathcal{O}(1/r)$, which means the temperature would be unbounded at the origin. This violates the problem statement that the temperature field remains bounded. The argument is self-contradictory and the proposed scaling for $q_r$ is incorrect.\n**Verdict**: Incorrect.\n\nD. **Analysis of Option D**: This option claims that spherical symmetry implies $\\Theta(r,t)$ is an odd function of $r$. This is incorrect. A physical quantity like temperature at a point of symmetry must be single-valued and smooth. In a one-dimensional problem symmetric about $x=0$, the temperature profile $T(x)$ must be an even function, $T(x)=T(-x)$, to be physically realistic. Similarly, for a function that is smooth at the origin and depends only on $r = \\sqrt{x^2+y^2+z^2}$, its Taylor series expansion must be a series in powers of $r^2$. Thus, $\\Theta(r,t) = c_0(t) + c_1(t)r^2 + c_2(t)r^4 + \\dots$. This analytical form represents an *even* function of $r$. The derivative of an even function at the origin is zero, so $\\Theta_r(0,t)=0$. While the final conclusion is correct, the premise that $\\Theta(r,t)$ is an odd function is false, making the entire argument invalid.\n**Verdict**: Incorrect.\n\nE. **Analysis of Option E**: This option uses the integral form of the energy balance over a small spherical control volume (a ball of radius $r$). Rearranging the energy equation gives $\\int_{S_r} \\mathbf{q} \\cdot \\mathbf{n} \\, dA = \\int_{V_r} (\\dot{q} - \\rho c_p \\partial_t T) \\, dV$. The integrand on the right-hand side, $(\\dot{q} - \\rho c_p \\partial_t T)$, is bounded near $r=0$. The volume integral over a ball of radius $r$ will be proportional to the volume, which is $\\frac{4}{3}\\pi r^3$. Thus, the right-hand side is $\\mathcal{O}(r^3)$. On the left-hand side, due to spherical symmetry, $\\mathbf{q}\\cdot\\mathbf{n} = q_r(r,t)$ is constant over the sphere $S_r$. The integral is thus $q_r(r,t)$ times the surface area, $4\\pi r^2$. Equating the two sides gives $4\\pi r^2 q_r(r,t) = \\mathcal{O}(r^3)$. Solving for $q_r(r,t)$ yields $q_r(r,t) = \\frac{\\mathcal{O}(r^3)}{4\\pi r^2} = \\mathcal{O}(r)$. This means that as $r \\to 0^+$, $q_r(r,t)$ goes to zero. From Fourier's law, $q_r = -k\\Theta_r$, this directly implies that $\\Theta_r(0,t)=0$. This derivation is rigorous, starts from the integral form of the conservation law, and relies only on the given assumptions.\n**Verdict**: Correct.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{ABE}$$", "id": "2490677"}, {"introduction": "This practice guides you through the complete process of modeling a heat transfer problem from fundamental laws to a final temperature profile, putting the theoretical regularity condition into practice.

The temperature must be finite at $r=0$. Inspecting the term $-\\frac{C_1}{r}$ in the solution for $T(r)$, it is clear that this term will approach infinity as $r \\to 0$ unless $C_1=0$. Therefore, for a physically realistic, finite temperature at the center, we must impose the condition $C_1=0$. This is the regularity condition. An equivalent justification is that due to spherical symmetry, the heat flux at the center must be zero. The temperature gradient $\\frac{dT}{dr}$ must therefore be zero at $r=0$.

We solve for steady, spherically symmetric heat conduction in a hollow sphere with no heat generation. From part (b), the governing equation for the Kirchhoff variable $w(r)$ is $\\nabla^2 w = 0$. In spherical coordinates with only radial dependence, this is:\n$$ \\frac{1}{r^2} \\frac{d}{dr}\\left(r^2 \\frac{dw}{dr}\\right) = 0 $$\nIntegrating twice with respect to $r$ gives the general solution:\n$$ w(r) = -\\frac{C_1}{r} + C_2 $$\nwhere $C_1$ and $C_2$ are integration constants. The boundary conditions are $T(a)=T_a$ and $T(b)=T_b$. We transform these into conditions on $w$: $w(a)=w_a$ and $w(b)=w_b$.\nApplying these conditions:\n$$ w_a = -\\frac{C_1}{a} + C_2 $$\n$$ w_b = -\\frac{C_1}{b} + C_2 $$\nSolving this system for $C_1$ and $C_2$ and substituting back into the general solution for $w(r)$ yields the solution in several equivalent forms. A convenient form, expressing $w(r)$ as a linear interpolation of $w_a$ and $w_b$ in the $1/r$ coordinate, is:\n$$ w(r) = \\frac{w_a(1/r - 1/b) + w_b(1/a - 1/r)}{1/a - 1/b} = \\frac{w_a a(b-r) + w_b b(r-a)}{r(b-a)} $$\nTo find $T(r)$, we must invert the Kirchhoff transformation. From $w = k_0(T + \\frac{\\beta}{2}T^2)$, we solve for $T$:\n$$ \\frac{\\beta}{2} T^2 + T - \\frac{w}{k_0} = 0 $$\nThis quadratic equation has the solutions:\n$$ T = \\frac{-1 \\pm \\sqrt{1 - 4(\\beta/2)(-w/k_0)}}{\\beta} = \\frac{-1 \\pm \\sqrt{1 + 2\\beta w/k_0}}{\\beta} $$\nThe positive root must be chosen to ensure that $T \\to w/k_0$ in the limit $\\beta \\to 0$ (the constant conductivity case) and to yield physically meaningful positive absolute temperatures. Thus:\n$$ T(r) = \\frac{1}{\\beta}\\left(-1 + \\sqrt{1 + \\frac{2\\beta w(r)}{k_0}}\\right) $$\nA crucial simplification arises by noting that $1 + \\frac{2\\beta w(T)}{k_0} = 1 + 2\\beta(T + \\frac{\\beta}{2}T^2) = 1 + 2\\beta T + \\beta^2 T^2 = (1+\\beta T)^2$.\nThen, $(1+\\beta T(r))^2 = 1 + \\frac{2\\beta w(r)}{k_0}$. Since $w(r)$ is a linear combination of $w_a$ and $w_b$, $(1+\\beta T(r))^2$ will be the same linear combination of $(1+\\beta T_a)^2$ and $(1+\\beta T_b)^2$. Using the derived expression for $w(r)$:\n$$ (1+\\beta T(r))^2 = \\frac{a(b-r)(1+\\beta T_a)^2 + b(r-a)(1+\\beta T_b)^2}{r(b-a)} $$\nTaking the square root (positive root, since $k(T)>0$ implies $1+\\beta T>0$) and solving for $T(r)$ gives the final expression for the temperature profile:\n$$ T(r) = \\frac{1}{\\beta} \\left( -1 + \\sqrt{\\frac{a(b-r)(1+\\beta T_a)^2 + b(r-a)(1+\\beta T_b)^2}{r(b-a)}} \\right) $$\nThis is the closed-form analytical solution for the temperature field in the hollow sphere.", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{ \\frac{1}{\\beta} \\left( -1 + \\sqrt{\\frac{a(b-r)(1+\\beta T_a)^{2} + b(r-a)(1+\\beta T_b)^{2}}{r(b-a)}} \\right) } $$", "id": "2490692"}]}
