The Reynolds Analogy:\nThe Reynolds analogy postulates a direct proportionality between momentum transfer and heat transfer, expressed as the equality of the Stanton number, $St$, and half the Fanning friction factor, $f/2$.\n$$St_{\\mathrm{Reynolds}} = \\frac{f}{2}$$\nUsing the general identity $Nu = St \\cdot Re \\cdot Pr$, the Nusselt number predicted by the Reynolds analogy is:\n$$Nu_{\\mathrm{Reynolds}} = St_{\\mathrm{Reynolds}} \\cdot Re \\cdot Pr = \\left(\\frac{f}{2}\\right) Re \\cdot Pr$$\nThe problem supplies the Blasius correlation for the friction factor, $f = 0.079\\,Re^{-0.25}$.

The Chilton–Colburn Analogy:\nThe Chilton–Colburn analogy provides a more accurate correlation for fluids with $Pr \\neq 1$ by introducing a correction factor involving the Prandtl number. It is expressed via the Colburn j-factor for heat transfer, $j_H = St \\cdot Pr^{2/3}$, as:\n$$j_H = St_{\\mathrm{CC}} \\cdot Pr^{2/3} = \\frac{f}{2}$$\nFrom this, we can express the Stanton number for the Chilton–Colburn case:\n$$St_{\\mathrm{CC}} = \\frac{f/2}{Pr^{2/3}}$$\nUsing the general identity $Nu = St \\cdot Re \\cdot Pr$ again, the Nusselt number from the Chilton–Colburn analogy is:\n$$Nu_{\\mathrm{CC}} = St_{\\mathrm{CC}} \\cdot Re \\cdot Pr = \\left(\\frac{f/2}{Pr^{2/3}}\\right) Re \\cdot Pr$$\nThis simplifies to:\n$$Nu_{\\mathrm{CC}} = \\left(\\frac{f}{2}\\right) Re \\cdot Pr^{1 - 2/3} = \\left(\\frac{f}{2}\\right) Re \\cdot Pr^{1/3}$$\nSubstituting the Blasius correlation for $f$ gives:\n$$Nu_{\\mathrm{CC}} = \\left(\\frac{0.079\\,Re^{-0.25}}{2}\\right) Re \\cdot Pr^{1/3} = 0.0395\\,Re^{0.75} Pr^{1/3}$$\n\nNow we derive the requested ratio, $R = Nu_{\\mathrm{Reynolds}}/Nu_{\\mathrm{CC}}$. Using the derived expressions for $Nu_{\\mathrm{Reynolds}}$ and $Nu_{\\mathrm{CC}}$:\n$$R = \\frac{Nu_{\\mathrm{Reynolds}}}{Nu_{\\mathrm{CC}}} = \\frac{\\left(\\frac{f}{2}\\right) Re \\cdot Pr}{\\left(\\frac{f}{2}\\right) Re \\cdot Pr^{1/3}}$$\nThe terms $\\left(\\frac{f}{2}\\right)$ and $Re$ are common to both the numerator and the denominator and thus cancel. This cancellation shows that the ratio $R$ is independent of the Reynolds number and the specific friction factor correlation, as long as the same friction factor is used in both analogies.\nThe simplified analytic expression for the ratio $R$ is therefore dependent only on the Prandtl number, $Pr$:\n$$R = \\frac{Pr}{Pr^{1/3}} = Pr^{1 - 1/3} = Pr^{2/3}$$\n\nFinally, we evaluate this ratio for the given Prandtl number, $Pr = 7.00$:\n$$R = (7.00)^{2/3}$$\nCalculating this value:\n$$R \\approx 3.6593057$$\nThe problem requests the result to four significant figures.\n$$R \\approx 3.659$$\nThis result shows that for a fluid with $Pr = 7.00$, the simple Reynolds analogy overpredicts the heat transfer rate by a factor of approximately $3.659$ compared to the more accurate Chilton–Colburn analogy.", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{3.659} $$", "id": "2492096"}, {"introduction": "While the Chilton-Colburn analogy is a significant improvement, it still relies on a key assumption: that turbulent eddies transport momentum and heat with the same efficiency.

It presents a standard exercise in convective heat transfer theory, allowing for a direct and logical solution. We will proceed with the analysis.\n\nThe problem requires a multistep derivation and comparison of the Nusselt number, $Nu$, for turbulent flow in a pipe using different models.\n\nTask 1: Derive an expression for $Nu$ from the Chilton–Colburn analogy.\nThe analysis begins with the fundamental definitions provided. The Stanton number for heat transfer is $St \\equiv \\dfrac{h}{\\rho c_{p} u_{b}}$, and the Nusselt number is $Nu \\equiv \\dfrac{h D}{k}$. We must establish a relationship between these two dimensionless groups. To do this, we introduce the definitions of the Reynolds number, $Re \\equiv \\dfrac{\\rho u_{b} D}{\\mu}$, and the Prandtl number, $Pr \\equiv \\dfrac{c_{p} \\mu}{k}$.\n\nBy forming the product of the Reynolds and Prandtl numbers, we find:\n$$Re \\, Pr = \\left(\\frac{\\rho u_{b} D}{\\mu}\\right) \\left(\\frac{c_{p} \\mu}{k}\\right) = \\frac{\\rho u_{b} D c_{p}}{k}$$\nWe can now express the Nusselt number as a function of these groups by dividing $Nu$ by the product $Re \\, Pr$:\n$$\\frac{Nu}{Re \\, Pr} = \\frac{h D / k}{\\rho u_{b} D c_{p} / k} = \\frac{h}{\\rho c_{p} u_{b}}$$\nThe right-hand side is the definition of the Stanton number, $St$. Therefore, we have the identity:\n$$St = \\frac{Nu}{Re \\, Pr}$$\nThe problem states that the Chilton–Colburn analogy equates the heat transfer $j$-factor, $j_{H}$, to the momentum transfer $j$-factor. The heat transfer $j$-factor is defined as $j_{H} \\equiv St \\, Pr^{2/3}$. The appropriate momentum transfer $j$-factor for pipe flow is defined in terms of the Fanning friction factor, $f_{F}$, as $j_{M} \\equiv \\dfrac{f_{F}}{2}$.\n\nThe Chilton–Colburn analogy is therefore expressed as $j_{H} = j_{M}$, which becomes:\n$$St \\, Pr^{2/3} = \\frac{f_{F}}{2}$$\nThe problem provides the Darcy friction factor, $f_{D}$, and the relation $f_{D} = 4 f_{F}$. We must express the analogy in terms of $f_{D}$ by substituting $f_{F} = \\dfrac{f_{D}}{4}$:\n$$St \\, Pr^{2/3} = \\frac{f_{D}/4}{2} = \\frac{f_{D}}{8}$$\nNow, we substitute the expression for $St$ in terms of $Nu$, $Re$, and $Pr$ into this analogy equation:\n$$\\left(\\frac{Nu}{Re \\, Pr}\\right) Pr^{2/3} = \\frac{f_{D}}{8}$$\nFinally, we solve for the Nusselt number, $Nu$:\n$$Nu = \\left(\\frac{f_{D}}{8}\\right) Re \\, Pr \\, Pr^{-2/3} = \\left(\\frac{f_{D}}{8}\\right) Re \\, Pr^{1/3}$$\nThis is the explicit expression for $Nu$ implied by the Chilton–Colburn analogy.\n\nTask 2: Evaluate $Nu$ using the Chilton–Colburn analogy.\nWe use the expression derived in Task 1 with the given numerical values: $Re = 1.0 \\times 10^{5}$, $Pr = 5.00$, and $f_{D} = 0.0180$.\n$$Nu_{CC} = \\left(\\frac{0.0180}{8}\\right) (1.0 \\times 10^{5}) (5.00)^{1/3}$$\n$$Nu_{CC} = (0.00225) (1.0 \\times 10^{5}) (5.00)^{1/3}$$\n$$Nu_{CC} \\approx 225 \\times 1.709976 \\approx 384.7446$$\nRounding to three significant figures, the Nusselt number predicted by the Chilton–Colburn analogy is $385$.\n\nTask 3: Evaluate $Nu$ using the Dittus–Boelter correlation.\nThe problem instructs us to use the Dittus–Boelter correlation for heating of the fluid, which is a widely known empirical formula:\n$$Nu_{DB} = 0.023 \\, Re^{0.8} \\, Pr^{0.4}$$\nThis correlation is applicable for the given conditions ($Re = 10^{5} \\gtrsim 10^{4}$ and $Pr = 5.00$ is within the range $0.7 \\lesssim Pr \\lesssim 160$). Substituting the given values:\n$$Nu_{DB} = 0.023 \\, (1.0 \\times 10^{5})^{0.8} \\, (5.00)^{0.4}$$\n$$Nu_{DB} = 0.023 \\, (10^{4}) \\, (5.00)^{0.4}$$\n$$Nu_{DB} \\approx 230 \\times 1.903654 \\approx 437.8404$$\nThe Nusselt number predicted by the Dittus–Boelter correlation is approximately $438$.\n\nTask 4: Discuss the discrepancy and estimate the turbulent Prandtl number, $Pr_{t}$.\nThere is a notable discrepancy between the predictions: $Nu_{CC} \\approx 385$ and $Nu_{DB} \\approx 438$. The Dittus–Boelter correlation, being an empirical fit to extensive experimental data, is considered more accurate for this specific case.\n\nThe Chilton–Colburn analogy is a simplification based on the Reynolds analogy, which fundamentally assumes that the turbulent transport mechanisms for momentum and heat are identical. This implies that the eddy diffusivity for momentum, $\\nu_{t}$, is equal to the eddy diffusivity for heat, $\\alpha_{t}$. The ratio of these diffusivities is the turbulent Prandtl number, $Pr_{t} \\equiv \\dfrac{\\nu_{t}}{\\alpha_{t}}$. The simple Chilton-Colburn analogy implicitly assumes $Pr_{t} = 1$.\n\nIn reality, for fluids with molecular Prandtl number $Pr > 1$ (such as water or, in this case, a fluid with $Pr=5.00$), experimental evidence shows that turbulent eddies are slightly more effective at transporting heat than momentum, meaning $\\alpha_{t} > \\nu_{t}$. This results in a turbulent Prandtl number $Pr_{t} < 1$. Typical values for pipe flow are in the range of $0.85$ to $0.9$.\n\nThe problem provides a generalized analogy that accounts for this effect:\n$$Nu = \\left(\\frac{f_{D}}{8}\\right) Re\\, Pr^{1/3} \\, Pr_{t}^{-2/3}$$\nThis can be written as $Nu = Nu_{CC} \\cdot Pr_{t}^{-2/3}$. Since for this flow $Pr_{t} < 1$, the correction factor $Pr_{t}^{-2/3}$ is greater than $1$, leading to a higher, more accurate $Nu$ prediction than the simple analogy. This is consistent with our finding that $Nu_{DB} > Nu_{CC}$.\n\nWe can estimate an effective $Pr_{t}$ that reconciles the generalized analogy with the more accurate Dittus–Boelter value by setting $Nu = Nu_{DB}$:\n$$Nu_{DB} = Nu_{CC} \\cdot Pr_{t}^{-2/3}$$\nSolving for $Pr_{t}$:\n$$Pr_{t}^{-2/3} = \\frac{Nu_{DB}}{Nu_{CC}}$$\n$$Pr_{t} = \\left(\\frac{Nu_{DB}}{Nu_{CC}}\\right)^{-3/2} = \\left(\\frac{Nu_{CC}}{Nu_{DB}}\\right)^{3/2}$$\nUsing the unrounded values for better precision:\n$$Pr_{t} = \\left(\\frac{384.7446}{437.8404}\\right)^{3/2} \\approx (0.87873)^{3/2} \\approx 0.8245$$\nThis estimated value of $Pr_{t} \\approx 0.82$ is physically reasonable and consistent with the theoretical expectation that $Pr_t < 1$ for this type of flow, providing a mechanistic explanation for the discrepancy between the simple analogy and the empirical correlation.\nThe final answer required is the result of Task 2.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{385}$$", "id": "2492137"}, {"introduction": "In modern engineering design, highly accurate, broad-range correlations are indispensable.

We begin with the provided definitions.\n\nThe Chilton–Colburn factor is defined as:\n$$ j_H = St \\cdot Pr^{2/3} $$\nwhere $St$ is the Stanton number. The Stanton number is defined as:\n$$ St = \\frac{h}{\\rho\\,c_p\\,u} $$\nHere, $h$ is the heat transfer coefficient, $\\rho$ is the fluid density, $c_p$ is the specific heat capacity at constant pressure, and $u$ is the mean fluid velocity.\n\nOur goal is to express $St$ using only $Nu$, $Re$, and $Pr$.
