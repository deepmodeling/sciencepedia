It is therefore deemed valid. We proceed with the solution.\n\nThe derivation consists of three main parts as requested: first, the derivation of the local molar species conservation equation; second, its conversion to the mass-fraction form; and finally, the determination of the mass production rate for species $C$.\n\nFirst, we derive the local molar species conservation equation. The integral balance for the number of moles of species $i$ in an arbitrary, fixed control volume $V$ bounded by a surface $A$ is given by:\n$$ \\frac{d}{dt} \\int_V c_i \\, dV = - \\oint_A \\mathbf{N}_i \\cdot \\mathbf{n} \\, dA + \\int_V \\dot{R}_i \\, dV $$\nHere, $c_i$ is the molar concentration of species $i$, $\\mathbf{N}_i$ is the absolute molar flux, $\\mathbf{n}$ is the outward-pointing unit normal vector on the surface $A$, and $\\dot{R}_i$ is the net molar rate of production of species $i$ per unit volume due to chemical reaction.\n\nFor a fixed control volume, the time derivative can be moved inside the integral. Applying the Gauss divergence theorem to the surface integral transforms it into a volume integral:\n$$ \\oint_A \\mathbf{N}_i \\cdot \\mathbf{n} \\, dA = \\int_V \\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{N}_i \\, dV $$\nSubstituting these into the integral balance gives:\n$$ \\int_V \\frac{\\partial c_i}{\\partial t} \\, dV = - \\int_V \\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{N}_i \\, dV + \\int_V \\dot{R}_i \\, dV $$\nThis can be rearranged into a single volume integral:\n$$ \\int_V \\left( \\frac{\\partial c_i}{\\partial t} + \\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{N}_i - \\dot{R}_i \\right) \\, dV = 0 $$\nSince this equation must hold for any arbitrary control volume $V$, the integrand itself must be zero. This yields the local, differential form of the molar species conservation equation:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial c_i}{\\partial t} + \\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{N}_i = \\dot{R}_i $$\nThe absolute molar flux $\\mathbf{N}_i$ is the sum of the convective flux due to the bulk motion and the diffusive flux relative to that motion. The problem specifies the mass-averaged velocity $\\mathbf{v}$ as the reference for bulk motion. Thus, the absolute molar flux is decomposed as:\n$$ \\mathbf{N}_i = c_i \\mathbf{v} + \\mathbf{J}_i $$\nwhere $c_i \\mathbf{v}$ is the molar convective flux and $\\mathbf{J}_i$ is the molar diffusive flux of species $i$ relative to $\\mathbf{v}$. Substituting this decomposition into the conservation equation gives:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial c_i}{\\partial t} + \\nabla \\cdot (c_i \\mathbf{v} + \\mathbf{J}_i) = \\dot{R}_i $$\nThis expands to:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial c_i}{\\partial t} + \\nabla \\cdot (c_i \\mathbf{v}) + \\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{J}_i = \\dot{R}_i $$\nThis is the general local molar species conservation equation.\n\nNext, we identify the reaction source term $\\dot{R}_i$. For a general elementary reaction, the molar production rate of species $i$ is $\\dot{R}_i = \\nu_i R$, where $\\nu_i$ is the net stoichiometric coefficient of species $i$ ($\\nu_i = \\nu_i'' - \\nu_i'$, where $\\nu_i'$ and $\\nu_i''$ are the stoichiometric coefficients of reactants and products, respectively) and $R$ is the reaction rate.\nFor the reaction $A + B \\to C$, which is $1A + 1B \\to 1C$, the stoichiometric coefficients are $\\nu_A = -1$, $\\nu_B = -1$, and $\\nu_C = 1$. The problem states the intrinsic reaction rate is $R = k c_A c_B$. Therefore, the source terms for each species are:\n$$ \\dot{R}_A = (-1) R = -k c_A c_B $$\n$$ \\dot{R}_B = (-1) R = -k c_A c_B $$\n$$ \\dot{R}_C = (1) R = k c_A c_B $$\n\nNow, we convert the molar conservation equation to its mass-fraction form. The key definitions are:\nMolar concentration: $c_i = \\rho Y_i / M_i$\nMass diffusive flux: $\\mathbf{j}_i = M_i \\mathbf{J}_i$\nMass production rate: $\\dot{\\omega}_i = M_i \\dot{R}_i$\nwhere $\\rho$ is the mixture density, $Y_i$ is the mass fraction of species $i$, and $M_i$ is its molecular weight.\n\nWe start with the molar conservation equation and multiply it by $M_i$:\n$$ M_i \\frac{\\partial c_i}{\\partial t} + M_i \\nabla \\cdot (c_i \\mathbf{v}) + M_i \\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{J}_i = M_i \\dot{R}_i $$\nSubstituting $c_i = \\rho Y_i / M_i$ and recognizing that $M_i$ is a constant:\n$$ M_i \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t} \\left(\\frac{\\rho Y_i}{M_i}\\right) + M_i \\nabla \\cdot \\left(\\frac{\\rho Y_i}{M_i} \\mathbf{v}\\right) + \\nabla \\cdot (M_i \\mathbf{J}_i) = M_i \\dot{R}_i $$\n$$ \\frac{\\partial (\\rho Y_i)}{\\partial t} + \\nabla \\cdot (\\rho Y_i \\mathbf{v}) + \\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{j}_i = \\dot{\\omega}_i $$\nThis is the species conservation equation in terms of mass fraction $Y_i$. This form is often called the \"conservation form\". An alternative form using the material derivative can be found by expanding the first two terms and using the total mass continuity equation ($\\frac{\\partial \\rho}{\\partial t} + \\nabla \\cdot (\\rho \\mathbf{v}) = 0$), which yields $\\rho \\frac{D Y_i}{Dt} + \\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{j}_i = \\dot{\\omega}_i$. For the present purpose, the conservation form is sufficient.\n\nFinally, we determine the expression for the mass production rate of species $C$, denoted $\\dot{\\omega}_C$. From the definition, we have:\n$$ \\dot{\\omega}_C = M_C \\dot{R}_C $$\nFrom our earlier analysis of the reaction source term, we found:\n$$ \\dot{R}_C = k c_A c_B $$\nTherefore:\n$$ \\dot{\\omega}_C = M_C (k c_A c_B) $$\nTo express $\\dot{\\omega}_C$ in terms of the required variables ($k$, $\\rho$, $Y_{A}$, $Y_{B}$, $M_{A}$, $M_{B}$, $M_{C}$), we replace the molar concentrations $c_A$ and $c_B$ with their definitions in terms of mass fractions:\n$$ c_A = \\frac{\\rho Y_A}{M_A} $$\n$$ c_B = \\frac{\\rho Y_B}{M_B} $$\nSubstituting these into the expression for $\\dot{\\omega}_C$:\n$$ \\dot{\\omega}_C = M_C k \\left( \\frac{\\rho Y_A}{M_A} \\right) \\left( \\frac{\\rho Y_B}{M_B} \\right) $$\nRearranging the terms gives the final closed-form expression:\n$$ \\dot{\\omega}_C = k M_C \\frac{\\rho^2 Y_A Y_B}{M_A M_B} $$\nThis expression depends only on the variables specified in the problem statement.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{k M_{C} \\frac{\\rho^{2} Y_{A} Y_{B}}{M_{A} M_{B}}}$$", "id": "2523788"}, {"introduction": "Chemical source terms often make the species conservation equations highly nonlinear and challenging to solve analytically.

The flame is an infinitesimally thin sheet at a location $x_f$ where both $Y_F(x_f) = 0$ and $Y_O(x_f) = 0$. At this location, the mixture fraction has the stoichiometric value, so $Z(x_f) = Z_{\\text{st}}$.\nUsing the derived expression for $Z(x)$:\n$$\nZ(x_f) = 1 - \\frac{x_f}{L}\n$$\nEquating this with the expression for $Z_{\\text{st}}$:\n$$\n1 - \\frac{x_f}{L} = \\frac{Y_{O,L}}{s Y_{F,0} + Y_{O,L}}\n$$\nNow, we solve for the non-dimensional flame location $x_f/L$:\n$$\n\\frac{x_f}{L} = 1 - \\frac{Y_{O,L}}{s Y_{F,0} + Y_{O,L}} = \\frac{(s Y_{F,0} + Y_{O,L}) - Y_{O,L}}{s Y_{F,0} + Y_{O,L}}\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{x_f}{L} = \\frac{s Y_{F,0}}{s Y_{F,0} + Y_{O,L}}\n$$\nThis is the closed-form expression for the flame-sheet location.\n\nFinally, we evaluate this expression for the given parameter values:\n- $W_F = 16$, $W_O = 32$, $\\nu_F = 1$, $\\nu_O = 2$.\n- $Y_{F,0} = 0.35$, $Y_{O,L} = 0.28$.\n\nFirst, calculate the stoichiometric mass ratio $s$:\n$$\ns = \\frac{\\nu_O W_O}{\\nu_F W_F} = \\frac{2 \\cdot 32}{1 \\cdot 16} = \\frac{64}{16} = 4\n$$\nNow, substitute the values into the expression for $x_f/L$:\n$$\n\\frac{x_f}{L} = \\frac{4 \\cdot (0.35)}{4 \\cdot (0.35) + 0.28} = \\frac{1.4}{1.4 + 0.28} = \\frac{1.4}{1.68}\n$$\nThe numerical value is:\n$$\n\\frac{x_f}{L} = \\frac{140}{168} = \\frac{5}{6} = 0.833333...\n$$\nRounding to four significant figures, the result is $0.8333$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.8333}$$", "id": "2523783"}, {"introduction": "While analytical solutions are invaluable, most real-world problems require numerical methods, which come with their own set of challenges.

The fluxes at the control volume faces are approximated using a centered difference scheme:\n$$ J_{i+1/2} \\approx -D \\frac{c_{i+1} - c_i}{\\Delta x} $$\n$$ J_{i-1/2} \\approx -D \\frac{c_i - c_{i-1}}{\\Delta x} $$\nSubstituting these fluxes into the semi-discretized equation yields:\n$$ \\frac{d c_i}{dt} \\Delta x = \\left(-D \\frac{c_i - c_{i-1}}{\\Delta x}\\right) - \\left(-D \\frac{c_{i+1} - c_i}{\\Delta x}\\right) = \\frac{D}{\\Delta x} (c_{i+1} - 2c_i + c_{i-1}) $$\n$$ \\frac{d c_i}{dt} = \\frac{D}{(\\Delta x)^2} (c_{i+1} - 2c_i + c_{i-1}) $$\nNow, we apply an explicit-in-time (Forward Euler) discretization to the time derivative, where the superscript $n$ denotes the time level $t=n\\Delta t$:\n$$ \\frac{c_i^{n+1} - c_i^n}{\\Delta t} = \\frac{D}{(\\Delta x)^2} (c_{i+1}^n - 2c_i^n + c_{i-1}^n) $$\nSolving for the concentration at the next time step, $c_i^{n+1}$:\n$$ c_i^{n+1} = c_i^n + \\frac{D \\Delta t}{(\\Delta x)^2} (c_{i+1}^n - 2c_i^n + c_{i-1}^n) $$\nLet us define the non-dimensional grouping $\\alpha = \\frac{D \\Delta t}{(\\Delta x)^2}$. This parameter is the grid Fourier number, or diffusion number. The update equation can be rewritten by grouping terms at the time level $n$:\n$$ c_i^{n+1} = \\alpha c_{i-1}^n + (1 - 2\\alpha) c_i^n + \\alpha c_{i+1}^n $$\nFor the updated value $c_i^{n+1}$ to be guaranteed non-negative when all values at the previous time step ($c_{j}^n$) are non-negative, the update must be a convex combination of its neighbors. This means the coefficients of $c_{j}^n$ in the expression for $c_i^{n+1}$ must be non-negative and sum to $1$. The sum of the coefficients is $\\alpha + (1-2\\alpha) + \\alpha = 1$. The non-negativity condition requires:\n$1.$ $\\alpha \\ge 0$. Since $D>0$, $\\Delta t > 0$, and $(\\Delta x)^2 > 0$, this is always true.\n$2.$ $1 - 2\\alpha \\ge 0$, which implies $2\\alpha \\le 1$, or $\\alpha \\le \\frac{1}{2}$.\n\nTherefore, the non-dimensional grouping that controls whether the update is a convex combination is $\\alpha = \\frac{D \\Delta t}{(\\Delta x)^2}$, and the condition is $\\frac{D \\Delta t}{(\\Delta x)^2} \\le \\frac{1}{2}$.\n\nIf this condition is violated (i.e., $\\alpha > 1/2$), the coefficient $(1-2\\alpha)$ becomes negative. In a region of steep gradients, it is possible for a node $i$ to have a high concentration $c_i^n > 0$ while its neighbors are near zero, $c_{i-1}^n \\approx 0$ and $c_{i+1}^n \\approx 0$. In this scenario, the update becomes $c_i^{n+1} \\approx (1-2\\alpha)c_i^n$. Since $c_i^n > 0$ and $(1-2\\alpha)  0$, the result $c_i^{n+1}$ will be negative. This numerical \"overshoot\" below zero is a direct consequence of the instability of the explicit scheme when the time step is too large for the given grid spacing and diffusivity.\n\n**Evaluation of the Non-dimensional Number**\nUsing the given values:\n$D = 1 \\times 10^{-9}\\,\\mathrm{m^2/s}$\n$\\Delta t = 0.5\\,\\mathrm{s}$\n$\\Delta x = 20\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m} = 20 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{m} = 2 \\times 10^{-5}\\,\\mathrm{m}$\n\nThe non-dimensional number is calculated as:\n$$ \\alpha = \\frac{D \\Delta t}{(\\Delta x)^2} = \\frac{(1 \\times 10^{-9}\\,\\mathrm{m^2/s}) \\times (0.5\\,\\mathrm{s})}{(2 \\times 10^{-5}\\,\\mathrm{m})^2} = \\frac{0.5 \\times 10^{-9}}{4 \\times 10^{-10}} = \\frac{5 \\times 10^{-10}}{4 \\times 10^{-10}} = \\frac{5}{4} = 1.25 $$\nThe condition for the update to be a convex combination is $\\alpha \\le 1/2$, which is $1.25 \\le 0.5$. This inequality is false. Thus, with the chosen parameters, the update is **not** a convex combination.\n\n**Option-by-Option Analysis**\n\n**A. Negative concentrations arise because, for sufficiently large $\\frac{D\\Delta t}{\\Delta x^{2}}$, the explicit update ceases to be a convex combination of nonnegative neighbor values; with steep gradients the discrete Laplacian is large, and the forward Euler step overshoots below zero. A boundedness-preserving alternative is to either enforce $\\frac{D\\Delta t}{\\Delta x^{2}} \\le 1/2$ so that the explicit weights remain nonnegative, or to use a fully implicit backward-Euler diffusion step whose coefficient matrix is an $M$-matrix satisfying a discrete maximum principle for any $\\Delta t$.**\nThis option correctly identifies the non-dimensional group $\\frac{D \\Delta t}{(\\Delta x)^2}$ and the critical value of $1/2$ for maintaining the convex combination property. It correctly explains the mechanism of overshoot. It also correctly proposes two standard remedies: reducing the time step to satisfy the stability condition for the explicit scheme, or switching to a fully implicit scheme, which is unconditionally stable and positivity-preserving for any $\\Delta t > 0$ due to its M-matrix property. The reasoning is entirely sound.\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\n**B. Negative concentrations indicate that Fickâ€™s law fails at high gradients and violates the second law; replacing it with a nonlinear constitutive relation $J=-D(c)\\,\\partial c/\\partial x$ with $D(c)$ increasing in $c$ unconditionally restores positivity for explicit schemes at any $\\Delta t$.**\nThis option incorrectly blames the physical model (Fick's law) for a numerical artifact. The diffusion PDE itself guarantees non-negativity. The proposed \"solution\" of using a nonlinear diffusivity does not remove the conditional stability of an explicit time-stepping scheme. The claim that this change \"unconditionally restores positivity... at any $\\Delta t$\" is false.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**C. The observed negativity is due solely to floating-point round-off; using double precision arithmetic eliminates it without changing the discretization or time step.**\nThis option confuses stability error with round-off error. The negative values arise from the amplification of errors inherent to the unstable numerical scheme, resulting in values that can be orders of magnitude different from zero. This is a truncation error issue, not a precision issue. Switching from single to double precision will not stabilize a fundamentally unstable scheme.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**D. Central differencing in space combined with a leapfrog time integrator for diffusion is unconditionally non-oscillatory and preserves non-negativity for any $\\Delta t$; thus switching to leapfrog time stepping resolves the issue without changing $\\Delta t$ or the spatial stencil.**\nThis option suggests using the leapfrog scheme for time integration. The leapfrog scheme ($\\frac{c^{n+1}-c^{n-1}}{2\\Delta t} = \\dots$) is known to be unconditionally unstable when applied to the diffusion equation. It is suitable for hyperbolic equations (like the wave equation) but not for parabolic equations. The claim that it is \"unconditionally non-oscillatory\" for diffusion is the opposite of the truth.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2523742"}]}
