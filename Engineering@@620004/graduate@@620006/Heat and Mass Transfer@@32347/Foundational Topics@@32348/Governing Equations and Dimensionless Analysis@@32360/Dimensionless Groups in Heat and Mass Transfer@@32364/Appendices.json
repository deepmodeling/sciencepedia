It represents a standard problem in the analysis of convective mass transfer in a laminar boundary layer. All necessary data are provided, and the requested tasks follow a logical sequence from first principles to a numerical result. Therefore, the problem is valid and a solution will be provided.\n\nThe problem requires the computation of the Schmidt number, the derivation of a scaling law for the ratio of boundary layer thicknesses, and the evaluation of this ratio for the given fluid properties.\n\nFirst, we address Task 1: computation of the Schmidt number, $Sc$.\nThe Schmidt number is defined as the ratio of momentum diffusivity (kinematic viscosity), $\\nu$, to mass diffusivity, $D$.\n$$Sc = \\frac{\\nu}{D}$$\nThe problem provides the following values: $\\nu \\approx 1.5 \\times 10^{-5}\\,\\mathrm{m^2/s}$ and $D \\approx 2.0 \\times 10^{-5}\\,\\mathrm{m^2/s}$.\nSubstituting these values into the definition:\n$$Sc = \\frac{1.5 \\times 10^{-5}\\,\\mathrm{m^2/s}}{2.0 \\times 10^{-5}\\,\\mathrm{m^2/s}} = \\frac{1.5}{2.0} = 0.75$$\nThe problem requires rounding to four significant figures. Thus, we write $Sc = 0.7500$.\n\nSecond, we address Task 2: derivation of the scaling law $\\delta_c(x)/\\delta(x) \\sim Sc^{-n}$ and determination of the exponent $n$.\nThe analysis begins with the steady, two-dimensional, laminar boundary layer equations for an incompressible fluid with constant properties and zero pressure gradient.\nThe continuity equation is:\n$$\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x} + \\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial y} = 0$$\nThe momentum equation in the streamwise ($x$) direction is:\n$$u \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x} + v \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial y} = \\nu \\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial y^2}$$\nThe species conservation (convection-diffusion) equation for a dilute, passive scalar is:\n$$u \\frac{\\partial C}{\\partial x} + v \\frac{\\partial C}{\\partial y} = D \\frac{\\partial^2 C}{\\partial y^2}$$\nHere, $u$ and $v$ are the velocity components in the $x$ (streamwise) and $y$ (wall-normal) directions, respectively.\n\nFrom a standard order-of-magnitude analysis of the momentum equation, the inertial terms on the left-hand side are balanced by the viscous term on the right-hand side. This leads to the well-known scaling for the hydrodynamic boundary layer thickness, $\\delta(x)$:\n$$\\frac{U_{\\infty}^2}{x} \\sim \\nu \\frac{U_{\\infty}}{\\delta^2} \\implies \\delta^2(x) \\sim \\frac{\\nu x}{U_{\\infty}}$$\n$$\\delta(x) \\sim \\sqrt{\\frac{\\nu x}{U_{\\infty}}}$$\n\nTo derive the scaling for the concentration boundary layer thickness, $\\delta_c(x)$, we perform an order-of-magnitude analysis of the species conservation equation. This requires an understanding of the velocity field within the concentration boundary layer. The nature of this velocity field depends on the ratio of $\\delta_c$ to $\\delta$, which is governed by the Schmidt number. The problem's mention of \"near-wall linearization\" correctly suggests we should analyze the case where the concentration boundary layer is embedded within the hydrodynamic boundary layer, which is valid for $Sc \\gtrsim 1$. In this regime, $\\delta_c \\ll \\delta$.\n\nWithin the hydrodynamic boundary layer, near the wall ($y \\ll \\delta$), the velocity profile is approximately linear. This is the \"near-wall linearization\". The wall shear stress is $\\tau_w = \\mu (\\partial u / \\partial y)_{y=0}$. From scaling, $\\tau_w \\sim \\mu U_{\\infty}/\\delta$. Thus, the velocity gradient at the wall scales as $(\\partial u / \\partial y)_{y=0} \\sim U_{\\infty}/\\delta$. The linearized velocity profile near the wall is therefore:\n$$u(y) \\sim \\frac{U_{\\infty}}{\\delta} y$$\nSince we assume $\\delta_c \\ll \\delta$, this linear velocity profile is valid throughout the entire concentration boundary layer. The characteristic streamwise velocity within the concentration boundary layer (at $y \\sim \\delta_c$) is:\n$$u_c \\sim \\frac{U_{\\infty}}{\\delta} \\delta_c$$\nNow, we apply an order-of-magnitude balance to the species equation within the layer of thickness $\\delta_c$. The convective term (left-hand side) must balance the diffusive term (right-hand side).\n$$u \\frac{\\partial C}{\\partial x} \\sim D \\frac{\\partial^2 C}{\\partial y^2}$$\nThe terms are scaled as follows, using $u \\sim u_c$:\nConvective term: $u_c \\frac{\\Delta C}{x} \\sim \\left(\\frac{U_{\\infty}}{\\delta}\\delta_c\\right) \\frac{\\Delta C}{x}$\nDiffusive term: $D \\frac{\\Delta C}{\\delta_c^2}$\nEquating the orders of magnitude:\n$$\\frac{U_{\\infty} \\delta_c}{\\delta x} \\sim \\frac{D}{\\delta_c^2}$$\nSolving for $\\delta_c$:\n$$\\delta_c^3 \\sim \\frac{D \\delta x}{U_{\\infty}}$$\nNow, we substitute the scaling for $\\delta(x) \\sim \\sqrt{\\nu x / U_{\\infty}}$:\n$$\\delta_c^3 \\sim \\frac{D x}{U_{\\infty}} \\sqrt{\\frac{\\nu x}{U_{\\infty}}} = D \\nu^{1/2} x^{3/2} U_{\\infty}^{-3/2}$$\nTaking the cube root of both sides gives the scaling for $\\delta_c$:\n$$\\delta_c \\sim (D \\nu^{1/2})^{1/3} (x^{3/2} U_{\\infty}^{-3/2})^{1/3} = D^{1/3} \\nu^{1/6} \\sqrt{\\frac{x}{U_{\\infty}}}$$\nWe form the ratio $\\delta_c/\\delta$ to find the desired scaling with $Sc$:\n$$\\frac{\\delta_c}{\\delta} \\sim \\frac{D^{1/3} \\nu^{1/6} \\sqrt{x/U_{\\infty}}}{\\nu^{1/2} \\sqrt{x/U_{\\infty}}} = \\frac{D^{1/3}}{\\nu^{1/2 - 1/6}} = \\frac{D^{1/3}}{\\nu^{1/3}} = \\left(\\frac{D}{\\nu}\\right)^{1/3}$$\nBy definition, $Sc = \\nu/D$.

This scaling is known to be a very good approximation for $Sc \\ge 0.6$.\n\nThird, we address Task 3: evaluation of the numerical value of $\\delta_c/\\delta$.\nThe derived scaling law, $\\delta_c/\\delta \\sim Sc^{-1/3}$, provides the functional dependence. For $Sc$ values not drastically different from unity, the constant of proportionality is approximately $1$. A more detailed analysis based on the similarity solution confirms that for $Sc \\ge 0.6$, the relation can be written as an approximate equality:\n$$\\frac{\\delta_c}{\\delta} \\approx Sc^{-1/3}$$\nOur computed Schmidt number is $Sc = 0.75$, which lies in the range of validity for this approximation. We can now evaluate the ratio numerically:\n$$\\frac{\\delta_c}{\\delta} \\approx (0.75)^{-1/3} = \\left(\\frac{3}{4}\\right)^{-1/3} = \\left(\\frac{4}{3}\\right)^{1/3}$$\nCalculating the numerical value:\n$$\\frac{\\delta_c}{\\delta} \\approx (1.3333...)^{1/3} \\approx 1.100642...$$\nRounding this result to four significant figures gives $1.101$.\n\nThe required final answer consists of the two calculated dimensionless numbers, $Sc$ and $\\delta_c/\\delta$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 0.7500 & 1.101 \\end{pmatrix}}$$", "id": "2477315"}, {"introduction": "The powerful analogy between heat and mass transfer allows us to predict one process from knowledge of the other, but it contains important subtleties.

Large $Le$ makes the mass-transfer boundary layer thicker than the thermal boundary layer, so $Sh < Nu$ and drying is much slower than cooling even at the dimensionless level.", "solution": "The problem statement has been validated and found to be sound. It is a standard problem in convective heat and mass transfer, free of scientific or logical flaws.\n\nWe begin the analysis from fundamental principles of boundary layer theory. The problem concerns laminar flow over a flat plate with simultaneous heat and mass transfer. The key dimensionless groups are the Lewis number ($Le = \\alpha/D_{AB} = Sc/Pr$), Prandtl number ($Pr$), and Schmidt number ($Sc$).\n\nFor laminar flow over a flat plate, the thicknesses of the thermal ($\\delta_T$) and concentration ($\\delta_C$) boundary layers are related to the hydrodynamic boundary layer thickness ($\\delta$) by $\\delta_T/\\delta \\approx Pr^{-1/3}$ and $\\delta_C/\\delta \\approx Sc^{-1/3}$.

The concentration boundary layer is much thinner than the thermal boundary layer.\n\nThe average Nusselt ($Nu$) and Sherwood ($Sh$) numbers for this configuration are given by correlations of the form $Nu \\propto Re^{1/2} Pr^{1/3}$ and $Sh \\propto Re^{1/2} Sc^{1/3}$. Since the Reynolds number ($Re$) is matched, we can find the ratio of $Sh$ to $Nu$:\n$$ \\frac{Sh}{Nu} = \\left(\\frac{Sc}{Pr}\\right)^{1/3} = Le^{1/3} $$\nSince $Le \\gg 1$, we have $Sh/Nu = Le^{1/3} \\gg 1$, which implies $Sh \\gg Nu$.\n\nNow, we must consider the implication for the dimensional rates of cooling (heat transfer) and drying (mass transfer). A common mistake is to assume that because $Sh \\gg Nu$, mass transfer must be more effective. This is incorrect, as the dimensionless numbers are scaled by different physical properties ($k$ for heat, $D_{AB}$ for mass). The condition $Le = \\alpha/D_{AB} \\gg 1$ means thermal diffusivity is much greater than mass diffusivity.\n\nTo compare the effectiveness of the two processes, we use the Chilton-Colburn analogy, which relates the heat transfer coefficient ($h$) and mass transfer coefficient ($k_c$):\n$$ \\frac{h}{\\rho c_p k_c} \\approx \\left(\\frac{Sc}{Pr}\\right)^{2/3} = Le^{2/3} $$\nThis ratio, sometimes called the psychrometric ratio, compares the capacity for heat transfer to that for mass transfer. Since $Le \\gg 1$, it follows that $Le^{2/3} \\gg 1$, meaning the ratio $h/(\\rho c_p k_c)$ is a large number. This indicates that, for comparable thermodynamic driving forces, the rate of convective heat transfer is significantly greater than the rate of convective mass transfer. The term \"cooling proceeds faster than drying\" is a qualitative description of this physical fact.\n\nWith these results, we can evaluate option A. It correctly states that $Sh/Nu \\sim Le^{1/3} \\gg 1$ and that the concentration boundary layer is thinner. Crucially, it correctly notes the paradox that although the dimensionless $Sh$ is larger, the dimensional analysis via the ratio $h/(\\rho c_p k_c) \\sim Le^{2/3} \\gg 1$ shows that cooling is the faster process.

The interfacial molar mass flux, $j$, is defined in terms of a mass transfer coefficient, $k_c$, and the concentration difference, $\\Delta C = C_s - C_b$:\n$$ j = k_c \\Delta C $$\nFrom this, the mass transfer coefficient is $k_c = \\frac{j}{\\Delta C}$.

The quantity to be minimized is $\\frac{u_{Sh}}{Sh} = \\sqrt{(\\frac{u_j}{j})^2 + (\\frac{u_D}{D})^2}$. This requires minimizing the individual relative standard uncertainties $\\frac{u_j}{j}$ and $\\frac{u_D}{D}$.\n\nTo minimize $\\frac{u_j}{j}$: The flux $j$ is measured via a gravimetric balance. If the primary source of uncertainty in $j$ is the standard uncertainty of the mass measurement, $u_{\\Delta m}$, which is often a fixed instrument limit, then to minimize the relative uncertainty in the measured mass, one must maximize the accumulated mass, $\\Delta m$. This can be achieved by increasing the experimental duration ($\\Delta t$), increasing the capture surface area ($A$), or increasing the mass flux, $j$, itself (e.g., by using a larger concentration driving force, $\\Delta C$, or higher fluid velocity).\n\nTo minimize $\\frac{u_D}{D}$: This uncertainty arises from an independent characterization. Minimization strategies include using a high-precision measurement technique (e.g., Taylor dispersion), ensuring precise temperature control (as diffusivity is strongly temperature-dependent), and performing multiple replicate measurements to reduce statistical error.\n\nA sensitivity analysis of the current experiment is instructive. The contribution of each source to the total variance of the relative uncertainty is proportional to its square. The variance from flux is $(0.0200)^2 = 0.000400$. The variance from diffusivity is $(0.0400)^2 = 0.001600$. The uncertainty in diffusivity contributes $\\frac{0.001600}{0.001600+0.000400} = 80\\%$ of the total variance. Therefore, to most effectively reduce the overall uncertainty in $Sh$, experimental effort should be prioritized on obtaining a more precise value for the diffusivity, $D$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.04472}$$", "id": "2477329"}]}
