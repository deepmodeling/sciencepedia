Let the first layer occupy the domain $0 \\le x \\le L_1$ and the second layer occupy $L_1 \\le x \\le L_1+L_2 = L$. The temperatures at the outer surfaces are $T(0) = T_a$ and $T(L) = T_b$. The temperature at the interface between the two layers is $T(L_1) = T_i$.\n\nFourier's law for one-dimensional steady heat conduction states that the heat flux $q_x''$ is given by:\n$$q_x'' = -k \\frac{dT}{dx}$$\nUnder steady-state conditions with no internal heat generation, the principle of energy conservation demands that the heat flux $q_x''$ must be constant throughout the composite wall.\n\nFor layer 1, the heat flux is:\n$$q_x'' = -k_1 \\frac{T_i - T_a}{L_1}$$\nFor layer 2, the heat flux is:\n$$q_x'' = -k_2 \\frac{T_b - T_i}{L_2}$$\nWe can express the temperature differences across each layer:\n$$T_a - T_i = q_x'' \\frac{L_1}{k_1}$$\n$$T_i - T_b = q_x'' \\frac{L_2}{k_2}$$\nThe total temperature difference across the composite is $\\Delta T = T_a - T_b$.

A uniform temperature gradient, $\\frac{dT}{dy}$, is applied in this direction. Since the layers are perfectly bonded and the gradient is uniform macroscopically, the gradient is the same in both layers: $\\frac{dT_1}{dy} = \\frac{dT_2}{dy} = \\frac{dT}{dy}$.\n\nThe heat flux in each layer is given by Fourier's law:\n$$q_{y,1}'' = -k_1 \\frac{dT}{dy}$$\n$$q_{y,2}'' = -k_2 \\frac{dT}{dy}$$\nThe total heat flow rate, $Q_y$, is the sum of the heat flow rates through each layer.

Let the volume fractions of the two phases be $\\phi_1$ and $\\phi_2$. For this one-dimensional layered geometry, the volume fractions are equivalent to the thickness fractions: $\\phi_1 = \\frac{L_1}{L_1+L_2}$ and $\\phi_2 = \\frac{L_2}{L_1+L_2}$.\n\nThe Wiener upper bound, $k_U$, corresponds to the arithmetic mean (parallel model):\n$$k_U = \\phi_1 k_1 + \\phi_2 k_2 = \\frac{L_1}{L_1+L_2}k_1 + \\frac{L_2}{L_1+L_2}k_2 = \\frac{k_1 L_1 + k_2 L_2}{L_1+L_2}$$\nThe Wiener lower bound, $k_L$, corresponds to the harmonic mean (series model):\n$$k_L = \\left( \\frac{\\phi_1}{k_1} + \\frac{\\phi_2}{k_2} \\right)^{-1} = \\left( \\frac{L_1/(L_1+L_2)}{k_1} + \\frac{L_2/(L_1+L_2)}{k_2} \\right)^{-1} = \\frac{L_1+L_2}{\\frac{L_1}{k_1} + \\frac{L_2}{k_2}}$$\nComparing our derived expressions:\n- The effective conductivity for parallel flow, $k_{eff, \\parallel}$, is identical to the Wiener upper bound, $k_U$. The parallel-flow configuration therefore **attains** the upper bound.\n- The effective conductivity for normal flow, $k_{eff, \\perp}$, is identical to the Wiener lower bound, $k_L$. The normal-flow configuration therefore **attains** the lower bound.\nThis result is axiomatic; these specific laminated structures are the physical models from which the Wiener bounds are derived.\n\nPart 4: Numerical Calculation\nThe given values are:\n$L_1=12 \\,\\text{mm}$, $L_2=8 \\,\\text{mm}$, $k_1=180 \\,\\text{W}\\,\\text{m}^{-1}\\,\\text{K}^{-1}$, and $k_2=20 \\,\\text{W}\\,\\text{m}^{-1}\\,\\text{K}^{-1}$.\nNote that for the formulas derived, the thicknesses appear as ratios, so we can use them in millimeters directly.\n\nFirst, calculate the effective conductivity for normal flow, $k_{eff, \\perp}$:\n$$k_{eff, \\perp} = \\frac{L_1+L_2}{\\frac{L_1}{k_1} + \\frac{L_2}{k_2}} = \\frac{12+8}{\\frac{12}{180} + \\frac{8}{20}} = \\frac{20}{\\frac{1}{15} + \\frac{2}{5}} = \\frac{20}{\\frac{1}{15} + \\frac{6}{15}} = \\frac{20}{\\frac{7}{15}} = \\frac{20 \\times 15}{7} = \\frac{300}{7} \\,\\text{W}\\,\\text{m}^{-1}\\,\\text{K}^{-1}$$\n\nNext, calculate the effective conductivity for parallel flow, $k_{eff, \\parallel}$:\n$$k_{eff, \\parallel} = \\frac{k_1 L_1 + k_2 L_2}{L_1+L_2} = \\frac{(180)(12) + (20)(8)}{12+8} = \\frac{2160 + 160}{20} = \\frac{2320}{20} = 116 \\,\\text{W}\\,\\text{m}^{-1}\\,\\text{K}^{-1}$$\n\nFinally, compute the ratio of the parallel-flow effective conductivity to the normal-flow effective conductivity:\n$$\\text{Ratio} = \\frac{k_{eff, \\parallel}}{k_{eff, \\perp}} = \\frac{116}{\\frac{300}{7}} = \\frac{116 \\times 7}{300} = \\frac{812}{300} = \\frac{203}{75}$$\nNumerically, this value is:\n$$\\frac{203}{75} \\approx 2.70666...$$\nRounding to four significant figures, the result is $2.707$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{2.707}$$", "id": "2535101"}, {"introduction": "In introductory fluid dynamics, kinematic viscosity, $\\nu$, is presented as the fundamental measure of momentum diffusion.

In viscoelastic fluids with stress relaxation and memory, momentum transport depends on the deformation history, and stress can obey evolution equations with material time derivatives. Mapping such dynamics to a single, time-independent kinematic viscosity $\\nu$ discards memory effects and is generally invalid.\nThis statement is correct. Viscoelastic constitutive models (e.g., Maxwell, Oldroyd-B) are fundamentally different from purely viscous ones.

In an unyielded region, $\\mathbf{D}=0$ because the material behaves like a rigid solid. The concept of viscosity links stress to the *rate of deformation*. If deformation is zero, the notion of viscous diffusion of momentum is inapplicable. While using a very large viscosity ($\\mu \\rightarrow \\infty$) is a numerical regularization technique to approximate a yield-stress fluid, it does not \"fully capture the physics.\" The true physical model is a conditional one based on a stress criterion ($\\|\\boldsymbol{\\tau}\\| < \\tau_y$), not a continuous diffusion process. The claim that this approach \"fully captures the physics\" is a significant overstatement.\nVerdict on D: **Incorrect**.\n\nE.

The momentum equation for a generalized-Newtonian fluid, $\\rho \\frac{D\\mathbf{v}}{Dt} = -\\nabla p + \\nabla \\cdot (2\\mu_{\\mathrm{app}}\\mathbf{D})$, is highly nonlinear. The term $\\mathbf{v} \\cdot \\nabla\\mathbf{v}$ is the convective nonlinearity. More importantly, $\\mu_{\\mathrm{app}}$ depends on the velocity gradients, making the viscous term itself nonlinear. Specifically, $\\nabla \\cdot \\boldsymbol{\\tau} = 2\\mathbf{D} \\cdot \\nabla\\mu_{\\mathrm{app}} + \\mu_{\\mathrm{app}}\\nabla^2\\mathbf{v}$, where both $\\mu_{\\mathrm{app}}$ and its gradient depend on $\\mathbf{v}$.

Differentiating with respect to $x_A$:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial \\ln \\gamma_A}{\\partial x_A} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x_A} [A(1-x_A)^2] = A \\cdot 2(1-x_A) \\cdot (-1) = -2A(1-x_A) = -2Ax_B $$\nSubstituting this back into the expression for the thermodynamic factor:\n$$ \\Phi = x_A \\left( -2Ax_B + \\frac{1}{x_A} \\right) = 1 - 2Ax_A x_B $$\nNow, we substitute the given numerical values: $x_A = 0.35$, $x_B = 0.65$, and $A = 1.2$.\n$$ \\Phi = 1 - 2(1.2)(0.35)(0.65) = 1 - 2.4(0.2275) = 1 - 0.546 = 0.454 $$\n\nNext, we calculate the composition-weighted average diffusivity term:\n$$ x_A D_B^* + x_B D_A^* = (0.35)(0.7 \\times 10^{-9} \\, \\mathrm{m^2 \\, s^{-1}}) + (0.65)(1.3 \\times 10^{-9} \\, \\mathrm{m^2 \\, s^{-1}}) $$\n$$ = (0.245 \\times 10^{-9} + 0.845 \\times 10^{-9}) \\, \\mathrm{m^2 \\, s^{-1}} = 1.090 \\times 10^{-9} \\, \\mathrm{m^2 \\, s^{-1}} $$\n\nFinally, we calculate the interdiffusion coefficient $\\tilde{D}$:\n$$ \\tilde{D} = (x_A D_B^* + x_B D_A^*) \\times \\Phi = (1.090 \\times 10^{-9} \\, \\mathrm{m^2 \\, s^{-1}}) \\times (0.454) $$\n$$ \\tilde{D} = 0.49486 \\times 10^{-9} \\, \\mathrm{m^2 \\, s^{-1}} $$\nIn standard scientific notation, this is $4.9486 \\times 10^{-10} \\, \\mathrm{m^2 \\, s^{-1}}$.\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures.\n$$ \\tilde{D} \\approx 4.949 \\times 10^{-10} \\, \\mathrm{m^2 \\, s^{-1}} $$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{4.949 \\times 10^{-10}}$$", "id": "2535091"}]}
