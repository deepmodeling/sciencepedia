This practice guides you through using dimensional analysis to derive one of the most fundamental relationships in diffusion: the scaling of the characteristic diffusion length, $\\ell_d$, with time, $t$, and diffusivity, $D$. Mastering this concept allows for quick, back-of-the-envelope estimations of diffusion times and lengths, providing physical intuition that is invaluable in both theoretical work and practical design [@problem_id:2484489].", "problem": "A quiescent, homogeneous, isotropic solid slab contains a dilute, nonreacting species with concentration field $c(x,t)$, where $x$ is the one-dimensional spatial coordinate.

Express your final estimate for $t_{\\ast}$ in seconds as a single closed-form symbolic expression in terms of $L$ and $D$.", "solution": "(a) The derivation of the governing partial differential equation for the concentration field $c(x,t)$ begins with the principle of local mass conservation for the species. In a one-dimensional, quiescent medium without chemical reactions or sources/sinks, the time rate of change of the mass of the species within an arbitrary control volume must equal the net rate at which the species diffuses into that volume.\n\nConsider a thin slice of the slab of cross-sectional area $A$ located between positions $x$ and $x + \\Delta x$. The mass of the species in this volume is $\\int_{x}^{x+\\Delta x} c(\\xi, t) A \\, d\\xi$. The time rate of change of this mass is given by\n$$ \\frac{d}{dt} \\int_{x}^{x+\\Delta x} c(\\xi, t) A \\, d\\xi = A \\int_{x}^{x+\\Delta x} \\frac{\\partial c(\\xi, t)}{\\partial t} \\, d\\xi $$\nThe net flux of the species into this volume is the flux entering at face $x$ minus the flux exiting at face $x+\\Delta x$. Let $J(x,t)$ be the mass flux (mass per unit area per unit time). The net rate of mass entering the volume is $A J(x,t) - A J(x+\\Delta x, t)$.\nEquating the rate of change of mass to the net flux, we have:\n$$ A \\int_{x}^{x+\\Delta x} \\frac{\\partial c}{\\partial t} \\, d\\xi = A [J(x,t) - J(x+\\Delta x, t)] $$\nDividing by $A \\Delta x$ and taking the limit as $\\Delta x \\to 0$ yields the one-dimensional continuity equation in differential form:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial c}{\\partial t} = - \\lim_{\\Delta x \\to 0} \\frac{J(x+\\Delta x, t) - J(x,t)}{\\Delta x} = - \\frac{\\partial J}{\\partial x} $$\nThe problem states that the system obeys Fick's first law of diffusion, which is a constitutive relation for the flux:\n$$ J(x,t) = -D \\frac{\\partial c}{\\partial x} $$\nwhere $D$ is the constant tracer diffusivity. The negative sign signifies that diffusion occurs from regions of higher concentration to regions of lower concentration.\nSubstituting this expression for $J$ into the continuity equation gives:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial c}{\\partial t} = - \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} \\left(-D \\frac{\\partial c}{\\partial x}\\right) $$\nSince $D$ is given as a constant, independent of $c$ and $t$, it can be moved outside the spatial derivative:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial c}{\\partial t} = D \\frac{\\partial^2 c}{\\partial x^2} $$\nThis is the governing partial differential equation, known as Fick's second law of diffusion.\n\nTo determine the time dependence of a characteristic diffusion length scale $\\ell_{d}(t)$, we use dimensional analysis. The relevant physical quantities are the length scale $\\ell_d$, time $t$, and the diffusivity $D$. Let $[X]$ denote the dimensions of any quantity $X$. The dimensions of space and time are fundamental: $[x] = L$ and $[t] = T$.\nFrom the diffusion equation, we can deduce the dimensions of $D$:\n$$ \\left[\\frac{\\partial c}{\\partial t}\\right] = [D] \\left[\\frac{\\partial^2 c}{\\partial x^2}\\right] \\implies \\frac{[c]}{[t]} = [D] \\frac{[c]}{[x]^2} \\implies \\frac{1}{T} = [D] \\frac{1}{L^2} $$\nThus, the dimensions of diffusivity are $[D] = L^2 T^{-1}$.\nWe assume the diffusion length scale $\\ell_d$ is a function of only $D$ and $t$, as no other intrinsic length or time scales are specified in the problem. We can write a general power-law relationship:\n$$ \\ell_d = k D^a t^b $$\nwhere $a$ and $b$ are exponents to be determined and $k$ is a dimensionless constant. The dimensions of this equation must be consistent:\n$$ [\\ell_d] = [D]^a [t]^b \\implies L^1 T^0 = (L^2 T^{-1})^a (T^1)^b = L^{2a} T^{-a+b} $$\nEquating the exponents for each fundamental dimension ($L$ and $T$) on both sides of the equation:\nFor length $L$: $2a = 1 \\implies a = \\frac{1}{2}$\nFor time $T$: $-a + b = 0 \\implies b = a = \\frac{1}{2}$\nSubstituting these exponents back into the power-law relationship, we find:\n$$ \\ell_d = k D^{1/2} t^{1/2} = k \\sqrt{Dt} $$\nThis shows that the characteristic diffusion length scale $\\ell_{d}(t)$ grows proportionally to $\\sqrt{D t}$. The dimensionless constant $k$ is of order unity, its precise value depending on the exact definition of \"characteristic length,\" but the scaling relationship is robust.\n\n(b) For the finite slab of thickness $L$, the initial concentration is uniform at $c(x,0)=c_0$. For $t>0$, the concentrations at the boundaries $x=0$ and $x=L$ are fixed at $c(0,t)=0$ and $c(L,t)=0$. This setup causes two \"depletion\" boundary layers to form at the walls and propagate into the slab. The thickness of these layers at any time $t$ can be characterized by the diffusion length $\\ell_d(t)$ derived in part (a).\nThe problem provides a criterion to estimate the onset time $t_{\\ast}$ at which these two boundary layers begin to interact significantly. This criterion states that interaction begins when the layers, growing from opposite sides, meet at the center of the slab. The slab center is at $x=L/2$. Therefore, the thickness of a single boundary layer growing from one wall must equal half the slab's thickness.\nThe criterion is thus:\n$$ \\ell_d(t_{\\ast}) = \\frac{L}{2} $$\nUsing the scaling law derived previously, $\\ell_d(t) \\propto \\sqrt{Dt}$, we make an order-of-magnitude estimate by taking the dimensionless constant of proportionality to be $1$:\n$$ \\ell_d(t) \\approx \\sqrt{Dt} $$\nThis is a standard approach for such estimations, directly reflecting the balance of terms in the diffusion equation. Applying this to the criterion at time $t_{\\ast}$:\n$$ \\sqrt{D t_{\\ast}} = \\frac{L}{2} $$\nTo find the onset time $t_{\\ast}$, we square both sides of this equation:\n$$ D t_{\\ast} = \\left(\\frac{L}{2}\\right)^2 = \\frac{L^2}{4} $$\nSolving for $t_{\\ast}$ gives the final symbolic expression for the estimate:\n$$ t_{\\ast} = \\frac{L^2}{4D} $$\nThis result represents the characteristic time required for diffusive effects to propagate from the boundaries to the center of the domain.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{L^2}{4D}}$$", "id": "2484489"}, {"introduction": "While the assumption of a constant diffusivity simplifies analysis, in many real materials the rate of diffusion itself depends on the local species concentration.
