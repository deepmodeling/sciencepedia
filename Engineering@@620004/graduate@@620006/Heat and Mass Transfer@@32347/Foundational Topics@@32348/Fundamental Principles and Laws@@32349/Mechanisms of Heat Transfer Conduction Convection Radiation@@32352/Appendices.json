We may proceed with the solution.\n\nThe task is to classify the flow regime in a vertical channel filled with a buoyant, radiating gas. This classification depends on the relative importance of buoyancy, viscous, inertial, and thermal diffusion effects. The presence of a participating medium for radiation modifies the thermal transport, which must be correctly incorporated into the governing dimensionless numbers.\n\nThe starting point is the energy conservation equation for the fluid, which accounts for transport by convection, conduction, and radiation:\n$$\n\\rho c_p (\\mathbf{u} \\cdot \\nabla)T = k \\nabla^2 T - \\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{q}_{\\text{rad}}\n$$\nHere, $\\rho$ is the density, $c_p$ is the specific heat, $\\mathbf{u}$ is the velocity vector, $T$ is the temperature, $k$ is the thermal conductivity, and $\\mathbf{q}_{\\text{rad}}$ is the radiative heat flux vector.\n\nThe problem states to use the Rosseland diffusion approximation for the radiative heat flux.

The problem specifies that this approximation is to be applied about a mean temperature $T_m$. This implies we evaluate the temperature-dependent part of the coefficient, $T^3$, at $T_m$, thereby linearizing the radiative transport problem. This yields:\n$$\n\\mathbf{q}_{\\text{rad}} \\approx -\\left(\\frac{16 \\sigma T_m^3}{3 \\kappa}\\right)\\nabla T\n$$\nThis expression has the same form as Fourier's law of conduction, $\\mathbf{q}_{\\text{cond}} = -k \\nabla T$.

Calculate the effective Rayleigh number $Ra_{\\text{eff}}$:\n$$\nRa_{\\text{eff}} = \\frac{Ra}{1 + k_{\\text{rad}}/k}\n$$\n$5$. Apply the classification rules:\n    - If $Ra_{\\text{eff}} < 1$, the regime is $0$ (diffusion dominated).\n    - If $Ra_{\\text{eff}} \\ge 1$, calculate the effective Grashof number $Gr_{\\text{eff}} = Ra_{\\text{eff}}/Pr$.\n        - If $Gr_{\\text{eff}} < 100$, the regime is $1$ (viscous–buoyant laminar convection).\n        - If $Gr_{\\text{eff}} \\ge 100$, the regime is $2$ (inertia-influenced laminar convection).\n\nThis algorithm will be implemented to process the specified test cases. It is a direct application of the derived physical model.", "answer": "```python\n# The complete and runnable Python 3 code goes here.\n# Imports must adhere to the specified execution environment.\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Computes the flow regime classification for a set of test cases\n    involving natural convection with thermal radiation in a vertical channel.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define physical constants as given in the problem statement.\n    B = 0.01  # Channel spacing in meters\n    T_M = 400.0  # Mean temperature in Kelvin\n    K_GAS = 0.036  # Gas thermal conductivity in W·m⁻¹·K⁻¹\n    SIGMA = 5.670374419e-8  # Stefan–Boltzmann constant in W·m⁻²·K⁻⁴\n\n    # Define the test cases from the problem statement.\n    test_cases = [\n        # (Ra, Pr, ε_g)\n        (0.5, 0.7, 0.9),\n        (3.6, 0.7, 0.9),\n        (140.0, 10.0, 0.95),\n        (1397.0, 2.0, 0.95),\n        (447.0, 1.5, 0.95),\n        (447.0, 1.5, 0.7),\n        (300.0, 100.0, 0.9),\n        (3.0, 0.7, 0.7),\n    ]\n\n    def classify_regime(Ra, Pr, eps_g):\n        \"\"\"\n        Calculates the flow regime (0, 1, or 2) for a single case.\n\n        Args:\n            Ra (float): Classical Rayleigh number.\n            Pr (float): Prandtl number.\n            eps_g (float): Gas emissivity over path length b.\n\n        Returns:\n            int: The regime classification (0, 1, or 2).\n        \"\"\"\n        # Step 1: Calculate absorption coefficient (kappa)\n        # kappa = -ln(1 - ε_g) / b\n        kappa = -np.log(1 - eps_g) / B\n\n        # Step 2: Calculate radiative conductivity (k_rad)\n        # k_rad = (16 * σ * T_m^3) / (3 * κ)\n        k_rad = (16 * SIGMA * T_M**3) / (3 * kappa)\n\n        # Step 3: Calculate the ratio of radiative to molecular conductivity\n        k_rad_over_k = k_rad / K_GAS\n\n        # Step 4: Calculate effective Rayleigh number (Ra_eff)\n        # Ra_eff = Ra / (1 + k_rad / k)\n        Ra_eff = Ra / (1 + k_rad_over_k)\n\n        # Step 5: Apply classification rules\n        # Regime 0: diffusion dominated\n        if Ra_eff  1.0:\n            return 0\n\n        # For convection-influenced regimes, calculate effective Grashof number\n        # Gr_eff = Ra_eff / Pr\n        Gr_eff = Ra_eff / Pr\n\n        # Regime 1: viscous-buoyant laminar convection\n        if Gr_eff  100.0:\n            return 1\n        # Regime 2: inertia-influenced laminar convection\n        else:\n            return 2\n\n    results = []\n    for case in test_cases:\n        Ra, Pr, eps_g = case\n        regime = classify_regime(Ra, Pr, eps_g)\n        results.append(regime)\n\n    # Final print statement in the exact required format.\n    print(f\"[{','.join(map(str, results))}]\")\n\nsolve()\n```", "id": "2505964"}]}
