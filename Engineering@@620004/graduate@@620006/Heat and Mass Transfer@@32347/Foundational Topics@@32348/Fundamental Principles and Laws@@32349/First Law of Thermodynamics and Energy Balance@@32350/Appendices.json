It is well-posed, providing a clear initial condition and all necessary parameters to find a unique solution for the time required to reach a specified temperature. The data provided are consistent with known material properties (specifically, copper) and represent a physically realistic scenario. The language is objective and precise. The problem contains no scientific unsoundness, missing information, or logical contradictions. It is a standard, solvable problem in transient heat conduction.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. A solution will be provided.\n\nThe first required action is to verify that the lumped-capacitance approximation is justified. This approximation assumes a spatially uniform temperature distribution within the solid, which is valid when the internal conductive resistance is negligible compared to the external convective resistance. The ratio of these resistances is given by the Biot number, $Bi$.\nThe Biot number is defined as:\n$$Bi = \\frac{h L_c}{k}$$\nwhere $L_c$ is the characteristic length of the body. For a sphere, the characteristic length is the ratio of its volume $V$ to its surface area $A_s$.\n$$V = \\frac{4}{3} \\pi R^3$$\n$$A_s = 4 \\pi R^2$$\nThus, the characteristic length is:\n$$L_c = \\frac{V}{A_s} = \\frac{\\frac{4}{3} \\pi R^3}{4 \\pi R^2} = \\frac{R}{3}$$\nBefore calculating the Biot number, we must convert the radius to SI units: $R = 2.0\\ \\mathrm{mm} = 2.0 \\times 10^{-3}\\ \\mathrm{m}$.\nThe characteristic length is $L_c = \\frac{2.0 \\times 10^{-3}}{3}\\ \\mathrm{m}$.\nNow, we substitute the given values into the Biot number definition:\n$$Bi = \\frac{(250\\ \\mathrm{W/(m^2\\,K)}) \\left(\\frac{2.0 \\times 10^{-3}}{3}\\ \\mathrm{m}\\right)}{400\\ \\mathrm{W/(m\\,K)}} = \\frac{250 \\times 2.0 \\times 10^{-3}}{3 \\times 400} = \\frac{500 \\times 10^{-3}}{1200} \\approx 4.17 \\times 10^{-4}$$\nThe criterion for the lumped-capacitance method to be valid is $Bi \\ll 0.1$. Since our calculated value $Bi \\approx 4.17 \\times 10^{-4}$ is substantially smaller than $0.1$, the temperature distribution within the sphere can be assumed to be uniform at any instant in time. Therefore, the volume-averaged temperature $\\bar{T}(t)$ is equal to the temperature throughout the sphere, which we will denote as $T(t)$.\n\nNext, we apply the first law of thermodynamics to the sphere, treating it as a control volume. The energy balance is expressed as:\n$$\\frac{dE_{st}}{dt} = \\dot{E}_{in} - \\dot{E}_{out} + \\dot{E}_{gen}$$\nwhere $\\frac{dE_{st}}{dt}$ is the rate of change of energy stored in the control volume, $\\dot{E}_{in}$ is the rate of energy entering, $\\dot{E}_{out}$ is the rate of energy leaving, and $\\dot{E}_{gen}$ is the rate of energy generated within the volume.\nFor this problem:\n-   The rate of change of stored energy for an incompressible substance is $\\frac{dE_{st}}{dt} = \\rho V c_p \\frac{dT}{dt}$.\n-   There is no energy entering the control volume from the outside, so $\\dot{E}_{in} = 0$.\n-   Energy leaves the control volume via convection from the surface, given by Newton's law of cooling: $\\dot{E}_{out} = h A_s (T(t) - T_{\\infty})$.\n-   Energy is generated volumetrically at a constant rate $q'''$, so the total generation rate is $\\dot{E}_{gen} = q''' V$.\n\nSubstituting these terms into the energy balance equation:\n$$\\rho V c_p \\frac{dT}{dt} = -h A_s (T - T_{\\infty}) + q''' V$$\nTo solve this first-order ordinary differential equation, we divide by $\\rho V c_p$:\n$$\\frac{dT}{dt} = -\\frac{h A_s}{\\rho V c_p} (T - T_{\\infty}) + \\frac{q'''}{\\rho c_p}$$\nUsing the relation $\\frac{A_s}{V} = \\frac{3}{R}$, the equation becomes:\n$$\\frac{dT}{dt} = -\\frac{3h}{\\rho c_p R} (T - T_{\\infty}) + \\frac{q'''}{\\rho c_p}$$\nRearranging the terms:\n$$\\frac{dT}{dt} + \\frac{3h}{\\rho c_p R} T = \\frac{3h T_{\\infty}}{\\rho c_p R} + \\frac{q'''}{\\rho c_p}$$\nThis is a linear first-order ODE of the form $\\frac{dT}{dt} + aT = b$, where $a = \\frac{3h}{\\rho c_p R}$ and $b = \\frac{3h T_{\\infty}}{\\rho c_p R} + \\frac{q'''}{\\rho c_p}$.\nThe general solution is $T(t) = C \\exp(-at) + b/a$. The steady-state temperature is $T_{ss} = b/a = T_{\\infty} + \\frac{q'''R}{3h}$.\nThe solution can be written as:\n$$T(t) = T_{ss} + (T_0 - T_{ss})\\exp(-at)$$\nGiven that the initial temperature $T_0 = T_{\\infty}$, this simplifies. The solution becomes:\n$$T(t) - T_{\\infty} = (T_{ss} - T_{\\infty})(1 - \\exp(-at))$$\nSubstituting the expressions for $T_{ss}$ and $a$:\n$$T(t) - T_{\\infty} = \\left(\\frac{q''' R}{3h}\\right) \\left(1 - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{3h}{\\rho c_p R} t\\right)\\right)$$\nWe need to find the time $t$ at which the temperature reaches the target value, $T(t) = \\bar{T}$. Let us denote this target temperature as $T_f$.\n$$T_f - T_{\\infty} = \\left(\\frac{q''' R}{3h}\\right) \\left(1 - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{3h}{\\rho c_p R} t\\right)\\right)$$\nSolving for $t$:\n$$1 - \\frac{3h (T_f - T_{\\infty})}{q''' R} = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{3h}{\\rho c_p R} t\\right)$$\nTaking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n$$\\ln\\left(1 - \\frac{3h (T_f - T_{\\infty})}{q''' R}\\right) = -\\frac{3h}{\\rho c_p R} t$$\n$$t = -\\frac{\\rho c_p R}{3h} \\ln\\left(1 - \\frac{3h (T_f - T_{\\infty})}{q''' R}\\right)$$\nNow we substitute the numerical values:\n-   $T_f = 310\\ \\mathrm{K}$\n-   The pre-factor term is $\\frac{\\rho c_p R}{3h} = \\frac{(8960)(385)(2.0 \\times 10^{-3})}{3(250)} = \\frac{6899.2}{750} \\approx 9.1989\\ \\mathrm{s}$.\n-   The argument of the logarithm is $1 - \\frac{3(250)(310 - 300)}{(5.0 \\times 10^6)(2.0 \\times 10^{-3})} = 1 - \\frac{750(10)}{10000} = 1 - 0.75 = 0.25$.\n\nSubstituting these values into the expression for $t$:\n$$t = -(9.1989\\ \\mathrm{s}) \\ln(0.25) = -(9.1989\\ \\mathrm{s}) (-\\ln(4)) = (9.1989\\ \\mathrm{s}) \\ln(4)$$\n$$t \\approx (9.1989\\ \\mathrm{s}) \\times 1.38629 \\approx 12.7558\\ \\mathrm{s}$$\nRounding the result to three significant figures, the time required is $12.8\\ \\mathrm{s}$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{12.8}\n$$", "id": "2486348"}, {"introduction": "Many crucial engineering devices, from jet engines to power plants, are best analyzed as open systems operating at steady state.

The force from the viscous dashpot, $F_{\\mathrm{damp}}(t) = -b\\dot{x}(t)$.\n\nThe total work is the sum of the work done by each of these forces:\n$$\nW_{\\mathrm{net}} = W_b + W_{\\mathrm{atm}} + W_{\\mathrm{spring}} + W_{\\mathrm{damp}}\n$$\nThus, the work-energy theorem for the piston is:\n$$\nW_b + W_{\\mathrm{atm}} + W_{\\mathrm{spring}} + W_{\\mathrm{damp}} = \\Delta E_k\n$$\nWe can express the work done by the gas, $W_b$, as:\n$$\nW_b = \\Delta E_k - W_{\\mathrm{atm}} - W_{\\mathrm{spring}} - W_{\\mathrm{damp}}\n$$\nThe terms on the right-hand side can be calculated from the given piston trajectory $x(t)$. First, we determine the initial and final states of the piston at $t=0$ and $t\\to\\infty$.\n\nThe piston position is $x(t)=X\\left[1-\\exp\\!\\left(-\\alpha t\\right)\\left(1+\\alpha t\\right)\\right]$.\nAt $t=0$: $x(0) = X[1 - \\exp(0)(1+0)] = X(1-1) = 0$.\nAs $t\\to\\infty$: $x(\\infty) = \\lim_{t\\to\\infty} X\\left[1-\\exp\\!\\left(-\\alpha t\\right)\\left(1+\\alpha t\\right)\\right] = X(1 - 0) = X$.\n\nThe piston velocity is $\\dot{x}(t) = \\frac{d}{dt}x(t)$.\n$$\n\\dot{x}(t) = \\frac{d}{dt} \\left(X\\left[1-\\exp\\!\\left(-\\alpha t\\right)\\left(1+\\alpha t\\right)\\right]\\right) = X \\left[ -(-\\alpha\\exp(-\\alpha t)(1+\\alpha t) + \\exp(-\\alpha t)(\\alpha)) \\right] = X\\alpha^2 t \\exp(-\\alpha t)\n$$\nAt $t=0$: $\\dot{x}(0) = X\\alpha^2(0)\\exp(0) = 0$, which matches the given condition.\nAs $t\\to\\infty$: $\\dot{x}(\\infty) = \\lim_{t\\to\\infty} X\\alpha^2 t \\exp(-\\alpha t) = 0$, as the exponential term decays faster than $t$ grows.\n\nNow, we compute each energy term:\n$1$. Change in kinetic energy, $\\Delta E_k$:\n$$\n\\Delta E_k = \\frac{1}{2}m\\dot{x}(\\infty)^2 - \\frac{1}{2}m\\dot{x}(0)^2 = \\frac{1}{2}m(0)^2 - \\frac{1}{2}m(0)^2 = 0\n$$\n\n$2$. Work done by the atmosphere, $W_{\\mathrm{atm}}$:\nThe work done *by* the atmospheric force on the piston is $\\int_0^X F_{\\mathrm{atm}} dx_p$, where $dx_p$ is the piston displacement.\n$$\nW_{\\mathrm{atm}} = \\int_{x(0)}^{x(\\infty)} (-p_0 A) \\,dx = -p_0 A \\int_0^X dx = -p_0 A X\n$$\n\n$3$.

It is equal to the negative of the change in the spring's potential energy.\n$$\nW_{\\mathrm{spring}} = \\int_{x(0)}^{x(\\infty)} (-Kx) \\,dx = -K \\left[ \\frac{1}{2}x^2 \\right]_0^X = -\\frac{1}{2}KX^2\n$$\n\n$4$. Work done by the dashpot, $W_{\\mathrm{damp}}$:\nThe work done *by* the damping force is always negative (energy dissipation).\n$$\nW_{\\mathrm{damp}} = \\int F_{\\mathrm{damp}} \\cdot dx = \\int_0^\\infty F_{\\mathrm{damp}}(t) \\dot{x}(t) \\,dt = \\int_0^\\infty (-b\\dot{x}(t)) \\dot{x}(t) \\,dt = -b \\int_0^\\infty \\dot{x}(t)^2 \\,dt\n$$\nWe must evaluate this integral. Substituting $\\dot{x}(t) = X\\alpha^2 t \\exp(-\\alpha t)$:\n$$\nW_{\\mathrm{damp}} = -b \\int_0^\\infty (X\\alpha^2 t \\exp(-\\alpha t))^2 \\,dt = -b X^2 \\alpha^4 \\int_0^\\infty t^2 \\exp(-2\\alpha t) \\,dt\n$$\nThe integral is a standard form related to the Gamma function, $\\int_0^\\infty t^n \\exp(-ct) \\,dt = \\frac{n!}{c^{n+1}}$. For our case, $n=2$ and $c=2\\alpha$.\n$$\n\\int_0^\\infty t^2 \\exp(-2\\alpha t) \\,dt = \\frac{2!}{(2\\alpha)^{2+1}} = \\frac{2}{8\\alpha^3} = \\frac{1}{4\\alpha^3}\n$$\nSubstituting this result back into the expression for $W_{\\mathrm{damp}}$:\n$$\nW_{\\mathrm{damp}} = -b X^2 \\alpha^4 \\left(\\frac{1}{4\\alpha^3}\\right) = -\\frac{1}{4}b\\alpha X^2\n$$\n\nNow, we assemble the equation for $W_b$:\n$$\nW_b = \\Delta E_k - W_{\\mathrm{atm}} - W_{\\mathrm{spring}} - W_{\\mathrm{damp}}\n$$\n$$\nW_b = 0 - (-p_0 A X) - \\left(-\\frac{1}{2}KX^2\\right) - \\left(-\\frac{1}{4}b\\alpha X^2\\right)\n$$\n$$\nW_b = p_0 A X + \\frac{1}{2}KX^2 + \\frac{1}{4}b\\alpha X^2 = \\left(\\frac{1}{2}K + \\frac{1}{4}b\\alpha\\right)X^2 + p_0 A X\n$$\nThis expression represents the total work done by the gas.
