Since $k$ depends on $T$, the equation is nonlinear. The problem requires a variable transformation to linearize this equation. This is achieved through the Kirchhoff transformation.\n\nLet us introduce a new variable $U$, the Kirchhoff variable, defined by the relation:\n$$\ndU = k(T) dT\n$$\nUsing the chain rule, the derivative of $U$ with respect to $x$ is:\n$$\n\\frac{dU}{dx} = \\frac{dU}{dT} \\frac{dT}{dx} = k(T) \\frac{dT}{dx}\n$$\nSubstituting this into our governing equation yields:\n$$\n\\frac{d}{dx}\\left(\\frac{dU}{dx}\\right) = 0 \\quad \\text{or} \\quad \\frac{d^2U}{dx^2} = 0\n$$\nThis is a linear second-order ordinary differential equation for $U(x)$, as required. The general solution is a linear function of $x$:\n$$\nU(x) = C_1 x + C_2\n$$\nwhere $C_1$ and $C_2$ are constants of integration determined by the boundary conditions.\n\nTo find the boundary conditions for $U(x)$, we must first establish the explicit form of the transformation $U(T)$ by integrating the defining relation $dU = k(T)dT$.\n$$\nU(T) = \\int k(T) dT = \\int k_0 (1 + \\beta T) dT = k_0 \\left(T + \\frac{\\beta}{2}T^2\\right) + C_0\n$$\nThe integration constant $C_0$ may be set to zero without loss of generality, as it can be absorbed into the constant $C_2$ in the solution for $U(x)$. Thus, we define the transformation as:\n$$\nU(T) = k_0 \\left(T + \\frac{\\beta}{2}T^2\\right)\n$$\nThe physical boundary conditions are $T(0) = T_1$ and $T(L) = T_2$.

The relation is a quadratic equation for $T$:\n$$\nU(x) = k_0 \\left(T(x) + \\frac{\\beta}{2}T(x)^2\\right) \\implies \\frac{\\beta k_0}{2}T^2 + k_0 T - U(x) = 0\n$$\nSolving for $T$ using the quadratic formula $T = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$ with $a = \\frac{\\beta k_0}{2}$, $b = k_0$, and $c = -U(x)$:\n$$\nT(x) = \\frac{-k_0 \\pm \\sqrt{k_0^2 - 4\\left(\\frac{\\beta k_0}{2}\\right)(-U(x))}}{2\\left(\\frac{\\beta k_0}{2}\\right)} = \\frac{-k_0 \\pm \\sqrt{k_0^2 + 2\\beta k_0 U(x)}}{\\beta k_0}\n$$\n$$\nT(x) = \\frac{-1 \\pm \\sqrt{1 + \\frac{2\\beta U(x)}{k_0}}}{\\beta}\n$$\nWe must choose the physically admissible branch. For physical reality, the thermal conductivity $k(T) = k_0(1+\\beta T)$ must be positive. Since $k_0 > 0$, this implies $1 + \\beta T > 0$. We can use this condition to select the correct sign.

Since we require $1+\\beta T > 0$, this becomes $1+\\beta T$. To recover the identity $T=T$, we must choose the positive sign in the numerator: $\\frac{-1 + (1+\\beta T)}{\\beta} = T$. Thus, the physically correct solution for $T(x)$ is:\n$$\nT(x) = \\frac{-1 + \\sqrt{1 + \\frac{2\\beta U(x)}{k_0}}}{\\beta}\n$$\nNow, substitute the expression for $U(x)$:\n$$\n1 + \\frac{2\\beta U(x)}{k_0} = 1 + \\frac{2\\beta}{k_0}\\left(\\left(\\frac{U_2 - U_1}{L}\\right)x + U_1\\right) = \\left(1 + \\frac{2\\beta U_1}{k_0}\\right) + \\left(\\frac{2\\beta U_2}{k_0} - \\frac{2\\beta U_1}{k_0}\\right)\\frac{x}{L}\n$$\nRecognizing that $1+\\frac{2\\beta U_1}{k_0} = (1+\\beta T_1)^2$ and $1+\\frac{2\\beta U_2}{k_0} = (1+\\beta T_2)^2$, we can rewrite the term under the square root in a more elegant form:\n$$\n1 + \\frac{2\\beta U(x)}{k_0} = (1+\\beta T_1)^2 + \\left[(1+\\beta T_2)^2 - (1+\\beta T_1)^2\\right]\\frac{x}{L}\n$$\nSubstituting this into the expression for $T(x)$ gives the final, explicit solution for the temperature field:\n$$\nT(x) = \\frac{1}{\\beta} \\left( -1 + \\sqrt{(1+\\beta T_1)^2 + \\left[ (1+\\beta T_2)^2 - (1+\\beta T_1)^2 \\right] \\frac{x}{L}} \\right)\n$$\nThis expression is valid for $\\beta \\neq 0$.

The slab is homogeneous, and heat flow is one-dimensional, steady-state, and without internal heat generation. Consider a thin slice of the material of thickness $dx$ located at position $x$, with a constant cross-sectional area $A$. In steady state, the rate of heat entering the slice at face $x$ must equal the rate of heat leaving the slice at face $x+dx$. Let $q''(x)$ be the heat flux (heat flow per unit area per unit time) in the positive $x$ direction.

We use the relation $\\mathbf{q}'' = -\\mathbf{K} \\nabla T$. Instead of direct matrix multiplication, it is more elegant and less computationally intensive to use the invariant form of the action of $\\mathbf{K}$ on a vector $\\mathbf{v}$:\n$$\n\\mathbf{K}\\mathbf{v} = (k_{\\perp}\\mathbf{I} + (k_{\\parallel} - k_{\\perp})(\\mathbf{n} \\otimes \\mathbf{n}))\\mathbf{v} = k_{\\perp}\\mathbf{v} + (k_{\\parallel} - k_{\\perp})(\\mathbf{n} \\cdot \\mathbf{v})\\mathbf{n}\n$$\nLet $\\mathbf{g} = \\nabla T$. We first compute the scalar product $\\mathbf{n} \\cdot \\mathbf{g}$:\n$$\n\\mathbf{n} \\cdot \\mathbf{g} = \\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right)(9) + \\left(\\frac{2}{3}\\right)(-6) + \\left(\\frac{2}{3}\\right)(3) = 3 - 4 + 2 = 1\n$$\nNow we compute $\\mathbf{K}\\mathbf{g}$:\n$$\n\\mathbf{K}\\mathbf{g} = k_{\\perp}\\mathbf{g} + (k_{\\parallel} - k_{\\perp})(\\mathbf{n} \\cdot \\mathbf{g})\\mathbf{n} = 15 \\begin{pmatrix} 9 \\\\ -6 \\\\ 3 \\end{pmatrix} + (205)(1) \\begin{pmatrix} 1/3 \\\\ 2/3 \\\\ 2/3 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\n$$\n\\mathbf{K}\\mathbf{g} = \\begin{pmatrix} 135 \\\\ -90 \\\\ 45 \\end{pmatrix} + \\begin{pmatrix} 205/3 \\\\ 410/3 \\\\ 410/3 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nWe perform the vector addition with exact rational numbers:\nFirst component: $135 + \\frac{205}{3} = \\frac{405 + 205}{3} = \\frac{610}{3}$\nSecond component: $-90 + \\frac{410}{3} = \\frac{-270 + 410}{3} = \\frac{140}{3}$\nThird component: $45 + \\frac{410}{3} = \\frac{135 + 410}{3} = \\frac{545}{3}$\nSo, $\\mathbf{K}\\nabla T = (\\frac{610}{3}, \\frac{140}{3}, \\frac{545}{3})$.\nThe heat flux vector is $\\mathbf{q}'' = -\\mathbf{K}\\nabla T$:\n$$\n\\mathbf{q}'' = \\left(-\\frac{610}{3}, -\\frac{140}{3}, -\\frac{545}{3}\\right)\n$$\nThe units are $\\text{W m}^{-2}$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} -\\frac{610}{3} & -\\frac{140}{3} & -\\frac{545}{3} \\end{pmatrix}}\n$$", "id": "2489726"}]}
