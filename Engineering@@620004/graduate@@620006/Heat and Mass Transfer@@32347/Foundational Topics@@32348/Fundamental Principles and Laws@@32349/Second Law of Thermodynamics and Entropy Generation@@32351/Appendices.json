A paddle wheel stirs the air vigorously. Due to internal friction, the air temperature rises to $T_{2} = 600$ K. There is no heat transfer with the surroundings during the actual process. The process is highly irreversible because of viscous dissipation.\n\nModel air as an ideal gas with specific gas constant $R = 0.287$ kJ/(kg·K). The mass of air is $m = 5.00$ kg. To compute the entropy change of the air, construct a reversible path between the same end states and use only tabulated ideal-gas properties. The ideal-gas “relative specific entropy” function $s^{0}(T)$, defined as the temperature-dependent contribution to specific entropy obtained by integrating $c_{p}(T)/T$ for a reversible path (with an arbitrary reference), has the following tabulated values for air:\n- $s^{0}(300\\,\\text{K}) = 5.743$ kJ/(kg·K),\n- $s^{0}(600\\,\\text{K}) = 6.439$ kJ/(kg·K).\n\nCompute the total entropy change of the air, $\\Delta S$ in kJ/K, by identifying a reversible path that connects the same initial and final states and using the provided tabulated properties.

Round your final numerical answer to four significant figures and express it in kJ/K.", "solution": "The problem as stated is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. It describes a standard thermodynamic process for which a unique solution can be found using fundamental principles. The problem requires the computation of the entropy change of a system and a justification for the method used.\n\nFirst, the justification for using a reversible path is addressed. Entropy, denoted by $S$, is a thermodynamic property. A property is a characteristic of a system's state, and thus a change in any property, such as $\\Delta S = S_{2} - S_{1}$, depends only on the initial (State $1$) and final (State $2$) equilibrium states. The change is independent of the path or process connecting these states. The actual process is an irreversible adiabatic stirring of the air. For any process, the entropy change of a closed system is related to heat transfer and entropy generation by the equation:\n$$ \\Delta S_{\\text{system}} = \\int_{1}^{2} \\frac{\\delta Q}{T_{b}} + S_{gen} $$\nHere, $T_{b}$ is the temperature at the boundary where heat transfer $\\delta Q$ occurs, and $S_{gen}$ is the entropy generated due to irreversibilities within the system. The tank is well-insulated, so there is no heat transfer with the surroundings, which means $\\delta Q = 0$. The process is stated to be highly irreversible, so $S_{gen} > 0$. Consequently, the entropy change of the air is equal to the entropy generated, $\\Delta S = S_{gen} > 0$.\n\nTo calculate the numerical value of $\\Delta S$, which is the state change $S_{2} - S_{1}$, we do not need to analyze the complex irreversible path. Instead, we can devise any convenient, completely reversible path that connects the identical initial State $1$ and final State $2$. The entropy change calculated for this fictitious reversible path will be exactly the same as for the actual irreversible process, because the endpoints are the same. A reversible path is chosen because the fundamental definition of entropy change is based on it:\n$$ \\Delta S = \\int_{1}^{2} \\left(\\frac{\\delta Q}{T}\\right)_{rev} $$\nThis integral must be evaluated along a reversible path.\n\nThe initial state (State $1$) of the air is given by $T_{1} = 300$ K and $p_{1} = 1.00$ bar. The final state (State $2$) is characterized by the temperature $T_{2} = 600$ K. The process occurs in a rigid tank, meaning the specific volume and total volume are constant ($v_{2} = v_{1}$ and $V_{2} = V_{1}$).\n\nThe change in specific entropy, $\\Delta s = s_{2} - s_{1}$, for an ideal gas can be expressed using the second T-ds relation, $Tds = dh - vdp$. For an ideal gas, the change in specific enthalpy is $dh = c_{p}(T)dT$ and the ideal gas law gives $v/T = R/p$. Integrating the T-ds relation between the two states provides the general formula for entropy change:\n$$ \\Delta s = \\int_{T_{1}}^{T_{2}} \\frac{c_{p}(T)}{T} dT - R \\ln\\left(\\frac{p_{2}}{p_{1}}\\right) $$\nThe problem provides tabulated values for the temperature-dependent part of the specific entropy, $s^{0}(T) = \\int_{T_{ref}}^{T} \\frac{c_{p}(T')}{T'} dT'$. This allows us to write the integral term as:\n$$ \\int_{T_{1}}^{T_{2}} \\frac{c_{p}(T)}{T} dT = s^{0}(T_{2}) - s^{0}(T_{1}) $$\nTherefore, the specific entropy change is given by:\n$$ \\Delta s = s^{0}(T_{2}) - s^{0}(T_{1}) - R \\ln\\left(\\frac{p_{2}}{p_{1}}\\right) $$\nTo apply this formula, we must determine the pressure ratio $p_{2}/p_{1}$. Since the air is a closed mass in a rigid tank, its volume is constant. Applying the ideal gas law, $pV = mRT$, to the initial and final states:\n$$ p_{1}V = mRT_{1} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad p_{2}V = mRT_{2} $$\nDividing the second equation by the first yields the relationship between pressure and temperature for this constant-volume process:\n$$ \\frac{p_{2}}{p_{1}} = \\frac{T_{2}}{T_{1}} $$\nSubstituting the given temperature values:\n$$ \\frac{p_{2}}{p_{1}} = \\frac{600\\,\\text{K}}{300\\,\\text{K}} = 2.00 $$\nNow, we can compute the change in specific entropy, $\\Delta s$, using the provided data:\n- $s^{0}(T_{1}) = s^{0}(300\\,\\text{K}) = 5.743$ kJ/(kg·K)\n- $s^{0}(T_{2}) = s^{0}(600\\,\\text{K}) = 6.439$ kJ/(kg·K)\n- $R = 0.287$ kJ/(kg·K)\n\nSubstituting these values into the equation for $\\Delta s$:\n$$ \\Delta s = (6.439 - 5.743)\\,\\frac{\\text{kJ}}{\\text{kg·K}} - \\left(0.287\\,\\frac{\\text{kJ}}{\\text{kg·K}}\\right) \\ln(2.00) $$\n$$ \\Delta s = 0.696\\,\\frac{\\text{kJ}}{\\text{kg·K}} - 0.287 \\times 0.693147... \\,\\frac{\\text{kJ}}{\\text{kg·K}} $$\n$$ \\Delta s = 0.696\\,\\frac{\\text{kJ}}{\\text{kg·K}} - 0.198953... \\,\\frac{\\text{kJ}}{\\text{kg·K}} $$\n$$ \\Delta s = 0.497046... \\,\\frac{\\text{kJ}}{\\text{kg·K}} $$\nThe problem requires the total entropy change, $\\Delta S$, for the given mass of air, $m = 5.00$ kg.

For an adiabatic throttling of a real gas with negligible changes in kinetic and potential energies, the exit specific entropy satisfies $s_2 > s_1$; the only way for $s_2 \\approx s_1$ is the degenerate limit of vanishing pressure drop, $p_2 \\to p_1$, which drives internal irreversibility to zero.**\nFor an adiabatic process, $\\dot{Q}=0$, and thus $q=0$.

Consequently, it must be that $s_2 - s_1 > 0$, or $s_2 > s_1$. The first part of the statement is correct.\nThe condition $s_2 \\approx s_1$ would require $s_{\\text{gen}} \\approx 0$. The source of entropy generation is the irreversibility associated with the pressure drop. As the pressure drop $p_1 - p_2$ approaches zero, i.e., in the limit $p_2 \\to p_1$, the process approaches a reversible limit, and the internal irreversibility vanishes. Thus, $s_{\\text{gen}} \\to 0$. This is the only physical limit in which an adiabatic throttling process becomes isentropic. The statement is entirely correct.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. If the valve is not adiabatic and rejects heat to a uniform-temperature jacket at temperature $T_b$ such that the net entropy flow with heat satisfies $\\dot{Q}/T_b \\approx -\\dot{S}_{\\mathrm{gen}}$ (per unit time), then $s_2 \\approx s_1$ even though the flow through the restriction is internally irreversible.**\nThe steady-flow entropy balance is $\\dot{m}(s_2 - s_1) = \\frac{\\dot{Q}}{T_b} + \\dot{S}_{\\text{gen}}$. The statement proposes the condition $\\frac{\\dot{Q}}{T_b} \\approx -\\dot{S}_{\\text{gen}}$. Substituting this into the entropy balance equation gives:\n$$ \\dot{m}(s_2 - s_1) \\approx -\\dot{S}_{\\text{gen}} + \\dot{S}_{\\text{gen}} = 0 $$\nSince the mass flow rate $\\dot{m}$ is non-zero, this directly implies $s_2 - s_1 \\approx 0$, or $s_2 \\approx s_1$. The statement correctly notes that the process is still internally irreversible ($\\dot{S}_{\\text{gen}} > 0$). The condition requires that $\\dot{Q}  0$ (heat rejection), so the entropy carried out of the control volume by heat transfer exactly balances the entropy generated internally. This is a valid application of the entropy balance equation.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**C. At the Joule–Thomson inversion temperature, an adiabatic throttling has $T_2 \\approx T_1$; therefore $s_2 \\approx s_1$.**\nAn adiabatic throttling process is isenthalpic ($h_1 = h_2$). The Joule-Thomson coefficient is defined as $\\mu_{JT} = \\left(\\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial p}\\right)_h$. At an inversion point, $\\mu_{JT} = 0$. For a small pressure drop across the valve starting from an inversion state, it is true that $T_2 \\approx T_1$. However, the statement's conclusion, \"therefore $s_2 \\approx s_1$,\" is a non-sequitur.\nFrom statement A, we know that for any adiabatic throttling with $p_2  p_1$, it must be that $s_2 > s_1$. The fact that initial and final temperatures are approximately equal does not negate this fundamental consequence of the second law. To be more formal, consider the Gibbs equation $Tds = dh - vdp$. For an isenthalpic process ($dh=0$), this becomes $Tds = -vdp$. Integrating from inlet to outlet:\n$$ s_2 - s_1 = \\int_1^2 -\\frac{v}{T}dp = \\int_{p_2}^{p_1} \\frac{v}{T}dp $$\nSince specific volume $v > 0$ and absolute temperature $T > 0$, and the integration is from a lower pressure $p_2$ to a higher pressure $p_1$, the integral must be positive. Therefore, $s_2 - s_1 > 0$. The equality of temperatures does not imply equality of entropies at different pressures.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. For an ideal gas in an adiabatic throttle, $h$ depends only on $T$ so $h_2 = h_1$ implies $T_2 = T_1$ and hence $s_2 = s_1$.**\nFor an adiabatic throttle, the process is isenthalpic, $h_2=h_1$. For an ideal gas, enthalpy is a function of temperature only. Thus, $h_2=h_1$ correctly implies $T_2=T_1$. The first part of the reasoning is sound. However, the conclusion \"hence $s_2 = s_1$\" is false.\nLet us use the entropy change equation for an ideal gas:\n$$ s_2 - s_1 = \\int_1^2 c_p(T) \\frac{dT}{T} - R \\ln\\left(\\frac{p_2}{p_1}\\right) $$\nSince $T_2 = T_1$, the integral term is zero. The equation simplifies to:\n$$ s_2 - s_1 = -R \\ln\\left(\\frac{p_2}{p_1}\\right) = R \\ln\\left(\\frac{p_1}{p_2}\\right) $$\nGiven $p_2  p_1$, the ratio $p_1/p_2 > 1$, and its natural logarithm is positive. Since the specific gas constant $R$ is positive, $s_2 - s_1 > 0$. Entropy must increase. The statement makes an erroneous conclusion.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**E. In a non-adiabatic throttling device that rejects heat (i.e., $\\dot{Q}  0$ with a nearly uniform boundary temperature $T_b$), the entropy increase of the stream relative to the adiabatic case is reduced; if $|\\dot{Q}|/T_b > \\dot{S}_{\\mathrm{gen}}$ it is possible to have $s_2  s_1$ without violating the second law of thermodynamics.**\nThe entropy balance is $\\dot{m}(s_2 - s_1) = \\frac{\\dot{Q}}{T_b} + \\dot{S}_{\\text{gen}}$.\nWith heat rejection, $\\dot{Q}  0$, so $\\dot{Q} = -|\\dot{Q}|$. The equation becomes:\n$$ \\dot{m}(s_2 - s_1) = -\\frac{|\\dot{Q}|}{T_b} + \\dot{S}_{\\text{gen}} $$\nThe term $-|\\dot{Q}|/T_b$ is negative. Compared to the adiabatic case where this term is zero, the change in specific entropy $s_2 - s_1$ is indeed reduced. The first part of the statement is correct.\nThe condition given is $|\\dot{Q}|/T_b > \\dot{S}_{\\text{gen}}$. Let's analyze its consequence for the entropy change:\n$$ -\\frac{|\\dot{Q}|}{T_b}  -\\dot{S}_{\\text{gen}} $$\n$$ -\\frac{|\\dot{Q}|}{T_b} + \\dot{S}_{\\text{gen}}  0 $$\nSubstituting this into the entropy balance:\n$$ \\dot{m}(s_2 - s_1)  0 $$\nSince $\\dot{m} > 0$, this implies $s_2 - s_1  0$, or $s_2  s_1$. This shows that a net decrease in the specific entropy of the fluid stream is possible under this condition.\nThe second law of thermodynamics requires $\\dot{S}_{\\text{gen}} \\ge 0$, which is the entropy generated *within* the control volume. The change in the entropy of the fluid flowing through the control volume, $s_2 - s_1$, can be positive, negative, or zero. A negative $s_2 - s_1$ does not violate the second law, as long as the entropy generation term remains non-negative. This is achieved by transferring entropy out of the control volume via heat transfer at a sufficient rate to overcompensate for the internal generation. The statement is entirely correct.\n**Verdict: Correct.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{ABE}$$", "id": "2521116"}]}
