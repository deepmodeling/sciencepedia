[@problem_id:2892530]", "problem": "An engineering dataset contains measurements from cyclic fatigue experiments on metallic materials covering two regimes: a high-cycle regime where plastic deformation per cycle is negligible and a low-cycle regime where plastic deformation per cycle dominates. Assume small strains, Hooke’s law holds in the elastic response, and that there is no intrinsic time scale that breaks scale invariance of the relation between amplitude and life in either regime. Under these assumptions, derive from first principles the appropriate scale-free model class and a statistically principled parameter estimation method for both regimes using only the following bases: the definition of strain, Hooke’s law, the assumption of scale invariance, and the assumption of lognormal multiplicative measurement scatter with constant variance in log-space. Use the derived models to estimate the parameters from the provided test data and compute the transition life where elastic and plastic strain amplitudes are equal.\n\nTasks:\n- From the assumption of scale invariance and absence of an intrinsic time scale, deduce the functional form that must relate amplitude and number of cycles to failure in each regime. Justify that the only continuous solution consistent with the functional equation implied by scale invariance is a power-law in the number of cycles.\n- Model the measurements in each regime as multiplicative with lognormal scatter of constant variance. Show that the corresponding maximum likelihood estimator reduces to a least-squares fit in the log-transformed variables, and provide explicit estimators for the slope and intercept in log-space.\n- In the high-cycle regime, the measured amplitude is a stress amplitude denoted by $\\sigma_a$ expressed in megapascals (MPa). In the low-cycle regime, the measured amplitude is a plastic strain amplitude denoted by $\\varepsilon_{p,a}$, which is dimensionless. Let the number of cycles to failure be $N$ (in cycles). Denote by $E$ the Young’s modulus (in MPa). Use Hooke’s law in the elastic regime to convert a stress amplitude to an elastic strain amplitude via $\\varepsilon_{e,a} = \\sigma_a / E$.\n- For each test case, using the deduced power-law model class and the maximum likelihood interpretation, estimate:\n  1.

It requires the derivation and application of fundamental models for high-cycle and low-cycle fatigue, followed by parameter estimation from experimental data. The problem is scientifically sound, well-posed, and contains all necessary information. We may therefore proceed with a solution.\n\nThe solution is structured as follows. First, we derive the functional form of the fatigue life models from the principle of scale invariance. Second, we establish the statistical estimation procedure based on the specified lognormal error model, showing its equivalence to linear least-squares regression in a transformed space. Finally, we apply these derived methods to the provided test cases to compute the required parameters.\n\n**1. Derivation of the Fatigue Model from Scale Invariance**\n\nWe are tasked to find the functional relationship between a cyclic loading amplitude, which we generically denote by $S$, and the number of cycles to failure, $N$. The model is of the form $S = f(N)$. The core physical assumption is that there is no intrinsic time scale (or cycle count scale) in the fatigue process within a given regime. This property is known as scale invariance.\n\nScale invariance implies that if we rescale the number of cycles by an arbitrary factor $\\alpha > 0$, i.e., $N \\to \\alpha N$, the corresponding amplitude $S$ will also be rescaled by a factor that depends only on $\\alpha$, say $g(\\alpha)$. This can be stated as a functional equation:\n$$f(\\alpha N) = g(\\alpha) f(N)$$\nfor all $N$ and $\\alpha$ in the domain of the function.\n\nTo find the form of $f(N)$, we assume $f$ is a continuous function, which is a minimal physical requirement. Let $N=1$. The equation becomes $f(\\alpha) = g(\\alpha) f(1)$. Let $A = f(1)$ be a constant representing the amplitude at $N=1$. Then $g(\\alpha) = f(\\alpha)/A$. Substituting this back into the functional equation gives:\n$$f(\\alpha N) = \\frac{f(\\alpha)}{A} f(N)$$\nTo solve this, we transform the equation by taking the natural logarithm:\n$$\\ln f(\\alpha N) = \\ln f(\\alpha) + \\ln f(N) - \\ln A$$\nLet us define a new function $F(x) = \\ln f(e^x)$. Let $x = \\ln N$ and $y = \\ln \\alpha$. Then $x+y = \\ln N + \\ln \\alpha = \\ln(\\alpha N)$. The equation transforms to:\n$$F(x+y) = F(y) + F(x) - \\ln A$$\nLet $G(x) = F(x) - \\ln A$. Substituting this gives $G(x+y) + \\ln A = G(y) + \\ln A + G(x) + \\ln A - \\ln A$, which simplifies to:\n$$G(x+y) = G(x) + G(y)$$\nThis is the Cauchy functional equation. For a continuous function $G$, the only solution is of the form $G(x) = m x$ for some constant $m$.\n\nReverting the substitutions:\n$F(x) - \\ln A = m x \\implies F(x) = m x + \\ln A$\n$\\ln f(e^x) = m x + \\ln A$\nFinally, let $N = e^x$, so $x = \\ln N$:\n$\\ln f(N) = m(\\ln N) + \\ln A = \\ln(N^m) + \\ln A = \\ln(A N^m)$\nExponentiating both sides, we arrive at the unique continuous solution:\n$$S(N) = A N^m$$\nThis is a power-law relationship. The constant $m$ is a dimensionless exponent and $A$ is a coefficient with the same units as the amplitude $S$. This form is known as the Basquin relation when $S$ is stress amplitude $\\sigma_a$, and is a form of the Coffin-Manson relation when $S$ is plastic strain amplitude $\\varepsilon_{p,a}$.\n\n**2. Parameter Estimation via Maximum Likelihood**\n\nThe problem states that measurements are subject to lognormal multiplicative scatter with constant variance in log-space. Let a measurement $S_i$ at a given $N_i$ be modeled as:\n$$S_i = S_{\\text{true}}(N_i) \\cdot \\delta_i = (A N_i^m) \\cdot \\delta_i$$\nwhere $\\delta_i$ is a random multiplicative error term. The assumption of lognormal scatter means that $\\ln(\\delta_i)$ follows a normal distribution. We assume $\\ln(\\delta_i) \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0, \\sigma_{\\ln}^2)$, where the mean is zero (i.e., the median of $\\delta_i$ is $1$) and the variance $\\sigma_{\\ln}^2$ is constant.\n\nTaking the natural logarithm of the model equation:\n$$\\ln S_i = \\ln(A N_i^m) + \\ln \\delta_i = \\ln A + m \\ln N_i + \\ln \\delta_i$$\nLet us define the log-transformed variables: $y_i = \\ln S_i$, $x_i = \\ln N_i$. Let the parameters in log-space be $b = \\ln A$ and $m$. The error term is $\\epsilon_i = \\ln \\delta_i \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0, \\sigma_{\\ln}^2)$. The model becomes a simple linear regression model:\n$$y_i = b + m x_i + \\epsilon_i$$\nThe goal of Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) is to find the parameters $(b, m)$ that maximize the likelihood of observing the given data $\\{(x_i, y_i)\\}_{i=1}^k$. The probability density function of a single observation $y_i$ is:\n$$p(y_i | x_i, b, m, \\sigma_{\\ln}) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi}\\sigma_{\\ln}} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{(y_i - (b + m x_i))^2}{2\\sigma_{\\ln}^2}\\right)$$\nAssuming the errors are independent, the likelihood function for the dataset is the product of individual probabilities:\n$$L(b, m, \\sigma_{\\ln}) = \\prod_{i=1}^k p(y_i | x_i, b, m, \\sigma_{\\ln})$$\nIt is more convenient to work with the log-likelihood function, $\\ell = \\ln L$:\n$$\\ell(b, m, \\sigma_{\\ln}) = \\sum_{i=1}^k \\ln p(y_i) = -\\frac{k}{2}\\ln(2\\pi\\sigma_{\\ln}^2) - \\frac{1}{2\\sigma_{\\ln}^2} \\sum_{i=1}^k (y_i - b - m x_i)^2$$\nTo find the maximum likelihood estimators for $b$ and $m$, we maximize $\\ell$ with respect to them. This is equivalent to minimizing the sum of squared residuals term, $SSR(b, m) = \\sum_{i=1}^k (y_i - b - m x_i)^2$. This is precisely the objective function for Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression.\n\nThus, the MLE for the parameters of a power-law model with multiplicative lognormal noise is equivalent to performing an OLS fit on the log-transformed data. The standard OLS estimators for slope $m$ and intercept $b$ are:\n$$ \\hat{m} = \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^k (x_i - \\bar{x})(y_i - \\bar{y})}{\\sum_{i=1}^k (x_i - \\bar{x})^2} = \\frac{k\\sum x_iy_i - (\\sum x_i)(\\sum y_i)}{k\\sum x_i^2 - (\\sum x_i)^2} $$\n$$ \\hat{b} = \\bar{y} - \\hat{m}\\bar{x} $$\nwhere $\\bar{x} = \\frac{1}{k}\\sum x_i$ and $\\bar{y} = \\frac{1}{k}\\sum y_i$.\nThe estimator for the original coefficient $A$ is then $\\hat{A} = \\exp(\\hat{b})$.\n\n**3. Application to Fatigue Regimes and Transition Life**\n\nWe apply this framework to the two specified regimes:\n\nHigh-Cycle Fatigue (HCF): The amplitude is stress $\\sigma_a$. The model is the Basquin relation:\n$$\\sigma_a(N) = A_{\\mathrm{hc}} N^{m_{\\mathrm{hc}}}$$\nThe parameters $\\hat{m}_{\\mathrm{hc}}$ and $\\hat{A}_{\\mathrm{hc}} = \\exp(\\hat{b}_{\\mathrm{hc}})$ are found by linear regression on $(\\ln N, \\ln \\sigma_a)$ data.\n\nLow-Cycle Fatigue (LCF): The amplitude is plastic strain $\\varepsilon_{p,a}$. The model is the Coffin-Manson relation:\n$$\\varepsilon_{p,a}(N) = B_{\\mathrm{lc}} N^{c_{\\mathrm{lc}}}$$\nThe parameters $\\hat{c}_{\\mathrm{lc}}$ and $\\hat{B}_{\\mathrm{lc}} = \\exp(\\hat{b}_{\\mathrm{lc}})$ are found by linear regression on $(\\ln N, \\ln \\varepsilon_{p,a})$ data.\n\nTransition Life ($N_t$): This is defined as the number of cycles where the elastic strain amplitude equals the plastic strain amplitude. The elastic strain amplitude $\\varepsilon_{e,a}$ is given by Hooke's law: $\\varepsilon_{e,a} = \\sigma_a/E$. The defining condition is:\n$$\\varepsilon_{e,a}(N_t) = \\varepsilon_{p,a}(N_t) \\implies \\frac{\\sigma_a(N_t)}{E} = \\varepsilon_{p,a}(N_t)$$\nSubstituting the fitted models:\n$$\\frac{\\hat{A}_{\\mathrm{hc}} N_t^{\\hat{m}_{\\mathrm{hc}}}}{E} = \\hat{B}_{\\mathrm{lc}} N_t^{\\hat{c}_{\\mathrm{lc}}}$$\nSolving for $N_t$:\n$$N_t^{\\hat{m}_{\\mathrm{hc}} - \\hat{c}_{\\mathrm{lc}}} = \\frac{E \\hat{B}_{\\mathrm{lc}}}{\\hat{A}_{\\mathrm{hc}}}$$\n$$N_t = \\left( \\frac{E \\hat{B}_{\\mathrm{lc}}}{\\hat{A}_{\\mathrm{hc}}} \\right)^{\\frac{1}{\\hat{m}_{\\mathrm{hc}} - \\hat{c}_{\\mathrm{lc}}}}$$\nThis formula allows for the direct computation of the transition life from the Young's modulus $E$ and the estimated parameters of the two fatigue regimes.

We begin by isolating the term containing $N_t$:\n$$\n\\frac{(2N_t)^b}{(2N_t)^c} = \\frac{\\varepsilon_f' E}{\\sigma_f'}\n$$\nUsing the property of exponents, $x^m / x^n = x^{m-n}$, we simplify the left-hand side:\n$$\n(2N_t)^{b-c} = \\frac{\\varepsilon_f' E}{\\sigma_f'}\n$$\nNext, we raise both sides to the power of $\\frac{1}{b-c}$:\n$$\n2N_t = \\left(\\frac{\\varepsilon_f' E}{\\sigma_f'}\\right)^{\\frac{1}{b-c}}\n$$\nFinally, solving for the transition life in cycles, $N_t$, we obtain the closed-form expression:\n$$\nN_t = \\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\frac{\\varepsilon_f' E}{\\sigma_f'}\\right)^{\\frac{1}{b-c}}\n$$\nNow, we evaluate this expression numerically using the provided material constants. It is critical to ensure consistent units.

This advanced practice explores how to account for these effects using the Smith-Watson-Topper (SWT) life parameter, which balances the damaging effect of the applied load with the material's inherent resistance. You will model the influence of compressive residual stress and solve for fatigue life, synthesizing multiple concepts into a powerful, practical design tool. [@problem_id:2892532]", "problem": "A component made of a metallic alloy is subjected to fully elastic or elastic-plastic cyclic loading. The manufacturer applies a surface treatment that induces compressive residual stresses that decay with depth. You are asked to derive, from first principles and well-tested relations, a computational procedure to predict the cycles to failure and to decide whether the failure is in the high-cycle or low-cycle regime for each of several load and treatment configurations. The procedure must be implementable as a program that produces numerical answers for a specified test suite.\n\nUse the following foundational base only:\n- Hooke’s law for uniaxial elasticity: the elastic strain amplitude is related to the stress amplitude by $\\epsilon_{e,a} = \\sigma_{a}/E$, where $E$ is the elastic modulus.\n- Cyclic Ramberg–Osgood relation for stabilized hysteresis at strain amplitude: the plastic strain amplitude contribution is $\\epsilon_{p,a} = (\\sigma_{a}/K')^{1/n'}$, where $K'$ is the cyclic strength coefficient and $n'$ is the cyclic strain hardening exponent.\n- The total strain amplitude is $\\epsilon_{a} = \\epsilon_{e,a} + \\epsilon_{p,a}$.\n- Linear superposition for mean stress including residual stress: the effective mean stress is the algebraic sum of the applied mean stress and the averaged residual stress over a material influence depth.\n- The Smith–Watson–Topper (SWT) critical-plane parameter is the product of the maximum stress and the total strain amplitude, and its material dependence on life arises from inserting the elastic–plastic strain-life relation (Manson–Coffin–Basquin form) into this product. Treat this as a definition-based modeling step; do not assume any shortcut life formula in advance of your derivation.\n- The total strain–life relation (Manson–Coffin–Basquin form) is a well-tested empirical law relating the strain amplitude to the number of reversals to failure.\n\nAssume the residual stress distribution produced by the surface treatment is compressive and decays exponentially with depth $z$ as $\\sigma_{\\mathrm{res}}(z) = -\\sigma_{r0}\\exp(-z/\\alpha)$, where $\\sigma_{r0}>0$ is the surface magnitude in $\\mathrm{MPa}$ and $\\alpha$ is a characteristic decay length in $\\mathrm{mm}$. To account for the near-surface process zone governing crack initiation, model the effective residual mean stress as the average of $\\sigma_{\\mathrm{res}}(z)$ against a normalized exponential influence function $w(z) = \\exp(-z/L)/L$ on $z\\in[0,\\infty)$, where $L$ is the influence depth in $\\mathrm{mm}$. The effective mean stress is thus\n$$\n\\sigma_{m,\\mathrm{eff}} = \\sigma_{m} + \\int_{0}^{\\infty} w(z)\\,\\sigma_{\\mathrm{res}}(z)\\,dz,\n$$\nwith $\\sigma_{m}$ the applied mean stress.

On the material side, derive the functional dependence $P_{\\mathrm{mat}}(N)$ that follows from the SWT definition when the total strain amplitude in the Manson–Coffin–Basquin relation is inserted, where $N$ is the cycles to failure and $2N$ is the reversals to failure. Then, for each test case below, solve the scalar nonlinear equation\n$$\nP_{\\mathrm{mat}}(N) = P_{\\mathrm{load}}\n$$\nfor $N$.\n\nAfter finding $N$, determine the regime classification by comparing the elastic and plastic contributions of the total strain amplitude at the predicted $N$.

The analysis must be founded upon established principles of materials mechanics, specifically strain-based fatigue. The final goal is to compute the number of cycles to failure, $N$, and classify the fatigue regime as either high-cycle or low-cycle for a given set of test cases.\n\nThe solution proceeds systematically. First, we determine the effective mean stress experienced by the material by averaging the residual stress over a characteristic depth. Second, we formulate the load-side driving parameter for fatigue damage. Third, we derive the corresponding material-side resistance parameter as a function of life. Fourth, we equate these two parameters to establish a nonlinear equation for the cycles to failure, $N$. Finally, we solve this equation and classify the failure regime.\n\nLet us begin with the effective mean stress. The problem states that the residual stress, $\\sigma_{\\mathrm{res}}(z)$, decays exponentially with depth $z$ from the surface:\n$$\n\\sigma_{\\mathrm{res}}(z) = -\\sigma_{r0}\\,\\exp(-z/\\alpha)\n$$\nwhere $\\sigma_{r0}$ is the positive magnitude of the compressive stress at the surface and $\\alpha$ is the decay length. The effective residual stress is modeled as an average over a near-surface region, weighted by an exponential influence function $w(z) = (1/L)\\exp(-z/L)$, where $L$ is the influence depth. The total effective mean stress, $\\sigma_{m,\\mathrm{eff}}$, is the sum of the applied mean stress, $\\sigma_m$, and this averaged residual stress:\n$$\n\\sigma_{m,\\mathrm{eff}} = \\sigma_{m} + \\int_{0}^{\\infty} w(z)\\,\\sigma_{\\mathrm{res}}(z)\\,dz\n$$\nWe evaluate the integral:\n$$\n\\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{L} e^{-z/L} \\left(-\\sigma_{r0} e^{-z/\\alpha}\\right) dz = -\\frac{\\sigma_{r0}}{L} \\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\exp\\left(-z\\left(\\frac{1}{\\alpha} + \\frac{1}{L}\\right)\\right) dz\n$$\nThe integral of $\\exp(-ax)$ from $0$ to $\\infty$ is $1/a$. Here, the coefficient in the exponent is $a = \\frac{1}{\\alpha} + \\frac{1}{L} = \\frac{L+\\alpha}{\\alpha L}$. Thus, the integral evaluates to $\\frac{\\alpha L}{\\alpha+L}$. The contribution from the residual stress is therefore:\n$$\n-\\frac{\\sigma_{r0}}{L} \\left( \\frac{\\alpha L}{\\alpha+L} \\right) = -\\sigma_{r0} \\frac{\\alpha}{\\alpha+L}\n$$\nThe effective mean stress is then given by:\n$$\n\\sigma_{m,\\mathrm{eff}} = \\sigma_{m} - \\sigma_{r0} \\frac{\\alpha}{\\alpha+L}\n$$\n\nNext, we establish the load-side Smith–Watson–Topper (SWT) parameter, $P_{\\mathrm{load}}$. This parameter is defined as the product of the maximum effective stress, $\\sigma_{\\max,\\mathrm{eff}}$, and the total strain amplitude, $\\epsilon_{a}$. The maximum effective stress is the sum of the effective mean stress and the applied stress amplitude, $\\sigma_{a}$:\n$$\n\\sigma_{\\max,\\mathrm{eff}} = \\sigma_{m,\\mathrm{eff}} + \\sigma_{a}\n$$\nThe total strain amplitude, $\\epsilon_{a}$, is the sum of its elastic and plastic parts, $\\epsilon_{e,a}$ and $\\epsilon_{p,a}$, which are given by Hooke's law and the cyclic Ramberg–Osgood relation, respectively:\n$$\n\\epsilon_{a} = \\epsilon_{e,a} + \\epsilon_{p,a} = \\frac{\\sigma_{a}}{E} + \\left(\\frac{\\sigma_{a}}{K'}\\right)^{1/n'}\n$$\nwhere $E$ is the elastic modulus, $K'$ is the cyclic strength coefficient, and $n'$ is the cyclic strain hardening exponent. Combining these expressions, the load-side parameter is:\n$$\nP_{\\mathrm{load}} = \\sigma_{\\max,\\mathrm{eff}} \\cdot \\epsilon_{a} = \\left(\\sigma_{m} - \\sigma_{r0} \\frac{\\alpha}{\\alpha+L} + \\sigma_{a}\\right) \\left(\\frac{\\sigma_{a}}{E} + \\left(\\frac{\\sigma_{a}}{K'}\\right)^{1/n'}\\right)\n$$\nThis parameter represents the severity of the applied loading condition.\n\nNow, we derive the material-side SWT parameter, $P_{\\mathrm{mat}}(N)$, which quantifies the material's resistance to fatigue as a function of the number of cycles to failure, $N$. The SWT model postulates that failure occurs when the load-side parameter equals the material-side parameter for a given life. The material-side parameter is established from fully-reversed ($\\sigma_m = 0$) loading conditions. Its value for a life of $N$ cycles is determined using the total strain–life relation (Manson–Coffin–Basquin):\n$$\n\\epsilon_{a}(N) = \\frac{\\sigma'_{f}}{E}(2N)^{b} + \\epsilon'_{f}(2N)^{c}\n$$\nwhere $\\sigma'_f$ and $b$ are the fatigue strength coefficient and exponent, and $\\epsilon'_f$ and $c$ are the fatigue ductility coefficient and exponent. The term $2N$ represents the number of reversals to failure. For the material side, the maximum stress $\\sigma_{\\max}$ corresponds to the stress amplitude $\\sigma_a$. The stress amplitude corresponding to a life $N$ is given by the elastic term of the strain-life relation (Basquin's law):\n$$\n\\sigma_{a}(N) = \\sigma'_{f}(2N)^{b}\n$$\nThus, $P_{\\mathrm{mat}}(N)$ is the product of this stress amplitude and the total strain amplitude at life $N$:\n$$\nP_{\\mathrm{mat}}(N) = \\sigma_{a}(N) \\cdot \\epsilon_{a}(N) = \\left(\\sigma'_{f}(2N)^{b}\\right) \\left(\\frac{\\sigma'_{f}}{E}(2N)^{b} + \\epsilon'_{f}(2N)^{c}\\right)\n$$\nExpanding this gives the final expression for the material's resistance:\n$$\nP_{\\mathrm{mat}}(N) = \\frac{(\\sigma'_{f})^2}{E}(2N)^{2b} + \\sigma'_{f}\\epsilon'_{f}(2N)^{b+c}\n$$\n\nThe core of the life prediction is solving the nonlinear scalar equation $P_{\\mathrm{mat}}(N) = P_{\\mathrm{load}}$ for $N$:\n$$\n\\frac{(\\sigma'_{f})^2}{E}(2N)^{2b} + \\sigma'_{f}\\epsilon'_{f}(2N)^{b+c} = \\left(\\sigma_{m} - \\sigma_{r0} \\frac{\\alpha}{\\alpha+L} + \\sigma_{a}\\right) \\left(\\frac{\\sigma_{a}}{E} + \\left(\\frac{\\sigma_{a}}{K'}\\right)^{1/n'}\\right)\n$$\nThe left-hand side is a monotonically decreasing function of $N$ since the exponents $b=-0.09$ and $c=-0.6$ are negative, ensuring $2b < 0$ and $b+c < 0$. The right-hand side is a constant for each given test case. This structure guarantees a unique, positive solution for $N$, which can be found using a numerical root-finding algorithm.\n\nFinally, the fatigue regime is classified based on the relative contributions of elastic and plastic strain to the total strain amplitude at the predicted life, $N$. The elastic strain amplitude component in the Manson-Coffin-Basquin equation is $\\epsilon_{e,a}(N) = (\\sigma'_{f}/E)(2N)^b$, and the plastic component is $\\epsilon_{p,a}(N) = \\epsilon'_{f}(2N)^c$. The regime is declared high-cycle fatigue if the elastic strain component is dominant or equal, and low-cycle fatigue otherwise. The indicator variable $H$ is defined as:\n$$\nH=1 \\quad \\text{if} \\quad \\left(\\frac{\\sigma'_{f}}{E}\\right)(2N)^{b} \\ge \\epsilon'_{f}(2N)^{c} \\quad \\text{(High-Cycle Fatigue)}\n$$\n$$\nH=0 \\quad \\text{if} \\quad \\left(\\frac{\\sigma'_{f}}{E}\\right)(2N)^{b} < \\epsilon'_{f}(2N)^{c} \\quad \\text{(Low-Cycle Fatigue)}\n$$\n\nThe computational procedure for each test case is as follows:\n1. Define all material constants: $E=210000 \\ \\mathrm{MPa}$, $\\sigma'_{f}=1100 \\ \\mathrm{MPa}$, $b=-0.09$, $\\epsilon'_{f}=0.5$, $c=-0.6$, $K'=1000 \\ \\mathrm{MPa}$, $n'=0.2$.\n2. For a given test case $(\\sigma_{a}, \\sigma_{m}, \\sigma_{r0}, \\alpha, L)$, calculate the constant $P_{\\mathrm{load}}$.\n3. Define the function $f(N) = P_{\\mathrm{mat}}(N) - P_{\\mathrm{load}}$.\n4. Numerically solve the equation $f(N)=0$ to find the cycles to failure $N$.\n5. Round $N$ to the nearest integer.\n6. Evaluate the high-cycle fatigue criterion at the calculated $N$ to determine the integer indicator $H$.\n7.
