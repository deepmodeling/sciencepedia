This value is assumed to be constant and independent of the test environment (high vacuum, dry nitrogen, ambient air).\n\nThe relationship between the applied (or nominal) stress intensity factor range, $\\Delta K$, and the effective range, $\\Delta K_{\\mathrm{eff}}$, is given by the crack-closure parameter, $U$:\n$$ \\Delta K_{\\mathrm{eff}} = U \\Delta K $$\nAt the fatigue threshold, this relationship becomes:\n$$ \\Delta K_{\\mathrm{eff,th}} = U \\Delta K_{\\mathrm{th}} $$\nGiven that $\\Delta K_{\\mathrm{eff,th}} = \\Delta K_{0}$ for all environments, we can state:\n$$ \\Delta K_{0} = U \\Delta K_{\\mathrm{th}} $$\nThis equation forms the basis for our entire analysis.\n\nThe problem provides data from a test conducted in high vacuum, where the measured threshold is $\\Delta K_{\\mathrm{th}}^{\\mathrm{vac}} = 2.30\\ \\mathrm{MPa}\\sqrt{\\mathrm{m}}$ and the closure parameter is $U^{\\mathrm{vac}} = 0.97$.

The increase in the measured $\\Delta K_{\\mathrm{th}}$ in nitrogen and air relative to vacuum is attributed to an increase in crack closure, primarily from the formation of corrosion debris (oxides) on the crack faces, a phenomenon known as oxide-induced crack closure. This increased closure leads to a lower effective stress intensity range at the crack tip for a given applied $\\Delta K$.\n\nFirst, let us calculate the closure parameter, $U$, for the dry nitrogen and ambient air environments.\nFor dry nitrogen, $\\Delta K_{\\mathrm{th}}^{\\mathrm{N_2}} = 2.80\\ \\mathrm{MPa}\\sqrt{\\mathrm{m}}$. The closure parameter is:\n$$ U^{\\mathrm{N_2}} = \\frac{\\Delta K_{0}}{\\Delta K_{\\mathrm{th}}^{\\mathrm{N_2}}} = \\frac{2.231\\ \\mathrm{MPa}\\sqrt{\\mathrm{m}}}{2.80\\ \\mathrm{MPa}\\sqrt{\\mathrm{m}}} \\approx 0.7968 $$\nFor ambient air, $\\Delta K_{\\mathrm{th}}^{\\mathrm{air}} = 3.60\\ \\mathrm{MPa}\\sqrt{\\mathrm{m}}$.

The definition of $U$ is:\n$$ U = \\frac{K_{\\max} - K_{\\mathrm{op}}}{K_{\\max} - K_{\\min}} = \\frac{K_{\\max} - K_{\\mathrm{op}}}{\\Delta K} $$\nFrom this, we can solve for $K_{\\mathrm{op}}$:\n$$ K_{\\mathrm{op}} = K_{\\max} - U \\Delta K $$\nWe must express $K_{\\max}$ in terms of $\\Delta K$ and the stress ratio $R$. The definitions are $R = K_{\\min}/K_{\\max}$ and $\\Delta K = K_{\\max} - K_{\\min}$.\nSubstituting $K_{\\min} = R K_{\\max}$ into the expression for $\\Delta K$:\n$$ \\Delta K = K_{\\max} - R K_{\\max} = K_{\\max}(1 - R) $$\nThus, $K_{\\max} = \\frac{\\Delta K}{1-R}$.
