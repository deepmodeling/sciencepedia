Let's trace one full cycle, conventionally starting from the point of maximum compressive strain.\n\nLet's denote the vertices of the loop as $A$, $B$, $C$, and $D$.\nPath $C \\rightarrow D$: The cycle begins at point $C$, where the strain is at its minimum value, $\\varepsilon = -\\varepsilon_{a}$, and the material has just completed yielding in compression, so the stress is $\\sigma = -\\sigma_{y}$. The coordinates of vertex $C$ are $(-\\varepsilon_{a}, -\\sigma_{y})$. As the strain is increased, the material unloads elastically with a slope $E$.
