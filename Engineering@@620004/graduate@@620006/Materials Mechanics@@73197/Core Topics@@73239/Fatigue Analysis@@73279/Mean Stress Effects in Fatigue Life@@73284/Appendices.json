The problem defines the amplitude as one-half of the peak-to-peak range. The peak-to-peak range is the difference between the maximum and minimum values, which is $\\sigma_{\\max} - \\sigma_{\\min}$.

A fully reversed cycle is one that is perfectly symmetric about a zero stress level. This fundamental definition leads to several equivalent mathematical conditions:\n1.  The mean stress must be zero: $\\sigma_m = 0$.\n2.  Substituting the definition of $\\sigma_m$, we get $\\frac{\\sigma_{\\max} + \\sigma_{\\min}}{2} = 0$, which implies $\\sigma_{\\max} + \\sigma_{\\min} = 0$, or $\\sigma_{\\max} = -\\sigma_{\\min}$. This means the maximum and minimum stresses must have equal magnitude and opposite sign.\n3.  From the definition of the stress ratio $R$, if $\\sigma_{\\max} = -\\sigma_{\\min}$ (and $\\sigma_{\\max} \\neq 0$), then $R = \\frac{\\sigma_{\\min}}{\\sigma_{\\max}} = \\frac{-\\sigma_{\\max}}{\\sigma_{\\max}} = -1$.\n4.

We check if the given cycle satisfies these conditions. We calculated $\\sigma_m = 157\\,\\text{MPa}$, which is not equal to $0$. Equivalently, $R \\approx -0.3129$, which is not equal to $-1$.

It does not violate any of the specified invalidity criteria. Therefore, the problem is **valid**. A solution will be derived.\n\nThe problem requires the derivation of fatigue failure criteria based on fundamental principles, specifically the behavior at zero mean stress and zero alternating stress. We are considering the Haigh diagram, which plots alternating stress amplitude $\\sigma_a$ against mean stress $\\sigma_m$.\n\nThe general form of a linear failure criterion connecting the intercepts on the $\\sigma_a$ and $\\sigma_m$ axes is given by the equation of a line. Per requirement (i), the line must pass through the point $(0, \\sigma_e)$. Per requirement (ii), it must pass through the point $(\\sigma_{static}, 0)$, where $\\sigma_{static}$ is the relevant static strength.

Thus, the relevant static strength is the yield strength, $\\sigma_{static} = \\sigma_{YS}$. The Soderberg criterion is therefore:\n$$ \\frac{\\sigma_a}{\\sigma_e} + \\frac{\\sigma_m}{\\sigma_{YS}} = 1 $$\nWe are given that the service mean stress is $\\sigma_m = 0.3\\,\\sigma_{YS}$.

Its equation is:\n$$ \\frac{\\sigma_a}{\\sigma_e} + \\frac{\\sigma_m}{\\sigma_{UTS}} = 1 $$\nFor a stress state to be safe, the combination must satisfy $\\frac{\\sigma_a}{\\sigma_e} + \\frac{\\sigma_m}{\\sigma_{UTS}} \\le 1$.

The standard equation, satisfying the boundary requirements, is:\n$$ \\frac{\\sigma_a}{\\sigma_e} + \\left(\\frac{\\sigma_m}{\\sigma_{UTS}}\\right)^2 = 1 $$\nFor a stress state to be safe, it must satisfy $\\frac{\\sigma_a}{\\sigma_e} + \\left(\\frac{\\sigma_m}{\\sigma_{UTS}}\\right)^2 \\le 1$.

The evaluation metric is the root-mean-square of the logarithmic amplitude error, $\\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{RMS}}$. The procedure involves four principal steps.\n\nFirst, the baseline S-N curve for fully reversed loading ($R=-1$) must be established. The problem specifies a power-law relationship between alternating stress $\\sigma_a$ and life $N$, which is linear in a log-log coordinate system:\n$$\n\\log_{10}\\sigma_{a} = C + k \\log_{10}N\n$$\nThe parameters $C$ (intercept) and $k$ (slope, related to the Basquin exponent) are determined via linear regression on the provided $R=-1$ dataset.

This fitted line defines the predicted alternating stress at a given life, denoted as $\\widehat{\\sigma}_{a}(N)$.\n\nSecond, we must derive the formulae for the equivalent fully reversed stress, $\\sigma_{a,\\mathrm{eq}}$, for each of the three correction models. This requires relating the mean stress $\\sigma_m$ to the alternating stress $\\sigma_a$ and the stress ratio $R$. From the fundamental definitions $\\sigma_{a} = (\\sigma_{\\max} - \\sigma_{\\min})/2$ and $\\sigma_{m} = (\\sigma_{\\max} + \\sigma_{\\min})/2$, we find $\\sigma_{\\max} = \\sigma_m + \\sigma_a$ and $\\sigma_{\\min} = \\sigma_m - \\sigma_a$.
