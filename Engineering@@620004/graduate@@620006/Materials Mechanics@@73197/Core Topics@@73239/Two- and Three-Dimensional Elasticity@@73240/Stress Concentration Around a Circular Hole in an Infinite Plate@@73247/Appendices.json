This occurs when $2\\theta = \\pi + 2k\\pi$, or $\\theta = \\pm \\frac{\\pi}{2}$ radians for $k \\in \\mathbb{Z}$. At these locations, the maximum hoop stress is:\n$$ \\sigma_{\\theta\\theta,\\max}\\big|_{r=a} = \\sigma_0 (1 - 2(-1)) = 3\\sigma_0 $$\nThis is the well-known stress concentration factor of $3$ for a circular hole. The locations are at the \"top\" and \"bottom\" of the hole, perpendicular to the applied tension.\n\nNext, we compute the von Mises equivalent stress, $\\sigma_{\\mathrm{vm}}$, at $r=a$. For a general state of plane stress, with principal stresses $\\sigma_1$, $\\sigma_2$ in the plane and $\\sigma_3=0$ out of the plane, the von Mises stress is given by:\n$$ \\sigma_{\\mathrm{vm}} = \\sqrt{\\sigma_1^2 - \\sigma_1 \\sigma_2 + \\sigma_2^2} $$\nAt the boundary of the hole ($r=a$), the stress components $\\sigma_{rr}$ and $\\sigma_{r\\theta}$ are both zero. This means that the radial ($r$) and tangential ($\\theta$) directions are the principal directions of stress in the plane. The in-plane principal stresses are thus $\\sigma_1 = \\sigma_{\\theta\\theta}$ and $\\sigma_2 = \\sigma_{rr} = 0$. The third principal stress, normal to the thin plate, is $\\sigma_3 = 0$ due to the plane stress assumption.\nThe state of stress at any point on the boundary is therefore uniaxial, with principal stresses $(\\sigma_{\\theta\\theta}, 0, 0)$.\nSubstituting these into the formula for von Mises stress:\n$$ \\sigma_{\\mathrm{vm}}(a, \\theta) = \\sqrt{\\sigma_{\\theta\\theta}^2 - \\sigma_{\\theta\\theta}(0) + 0^2} = \\sqrt{\\sigma_{\\theta\\theta}^2} = |\\sigma_{\\theta\\theta}(a, \\theta)| $$\nSubstituting the expression for the hoop stress:\n$$ \\sigma_{\\mathrm{vm}}(a, \\theta) = |\\sigma_0 (1 - 2\\cos(2\\theta))| $$\nSince $\\sigma_0 > 0$, we have $\\sigma_{\\mathrm{vm}}(a, \\theta) = \\sigma_0 |1 - 2\\cos(2\\theta)|$. To find the maximum value of $\\sigma_{\\mathrm{vm}}$, we must find the maximum value of the function $|1 - 2\\cos(2\\theta)|$. The function $f(\\theta) = 1 - 2\\cos(2\\theta)$ varies as $\\cos(2\\theta)$ ranges from $-1$ to $1$.\n- When $\\cos(2\\theta)=-1$ (at $\\theta = \\pm \\frac{\\pi}{2}$), $f(\\theta) = 1 - 2(-1) = 3$.\n- When $\\cos(2\\theta)=1$ (at $\\theta = 0, \\pi$), $f(\\theta) = 1 - 2(1) = -1$.\nThe function $f(\\theta)$ ranges from $-1$ to $3$. The maximum value of its absolute value, $|f(\\theta)|$, is $\\max(|-1|, |3|) = 3$.\nTherefore, the maximum von Mises stress is:\n$$ \\sigma_{\\mathrm{vm},\\max}\\big|_{r=a} = \\sigma_0 \\times 3 = 3\\sigma_0 $$\nThis maximum occurs where $|1 - 2\\cos(2\\theta)| = 3$, which happens only when $1 - 2\\cos(2\\theta) = 3$ (since $1 - 2\\cos(2\\theta) = -3$ is impossible). This condition implies $\\cos(2\\theta) = -1$, which corresponds to the angular locations $\\theta = \\pm \\frac{\\pi}{2}$ radians.\n\nFinally, we compute the dimensionless ratio $R$:\n$$ R = \\frac{\\sigma_{\\mathrm{vm},\\max}\\big|_{r=a}}{\\sigma_{\\theta\\theta,\\max}\\big|_{r=a}} = \\frac{3\\sigma_0}{3\\sigma_0} = 1 $$\nThe problem requires this value rounded to four significant figures, which is $1.000$.\n\nThe angular locations for the maximum hoop stress and the maximum von Mises stress coincide. The physical explanation is as follows:\nThe traction-free boundary condition ($\\sigma_{rr}=0, \\sigma_{r\\theta}=0$ at $r=a$) forces the stress state at the edge of the hole to become locally uniaxial, with the hoop stress $\\sigma_{\\theta\\theta}$ being the only non-zero principal stress (in the plane stress assumption where $\\sigma_3=0$). A key stress invariant is the second invariant of the deviatoric stress tensor, $J_2$, from which the von Mises stress is derived ($\\sigma_{\\mathrm{vm}}=\\sqrt{3J_2}$). For a uniaxial stress state with principal stress $\\sigma$, the von Mises stress simplifies to $\\sigma_{\\mathrm{vm}}=|\\sigma|$. In our case, this means $\\sigma_{\\mathrm{vm}}=|\\sigma_{\\theta\\theta}|$ everywhere on the hole's boundary.\nThe hoop stress $\\sigma_{\\theta\\theta}$ varies with angle $\\theta$ from a minimum compressive value of $-\\sigma_0$ at $\\theta=0, \\pi$ to a maximum tensile value of $3\\sigma_0$ at $\\theta = \\pm \\pi/2$. The maximum of $\\sigma_{\\theta\\theta}$ is therefore $3\\sigma_0$. The maximum of $\\sigma_{\\mathrm{vm}}=|\\sigma_{\\theta\\theta}|$ is $\\max(|-\\sigma_0|, |3\\sigma_0|) = 3\\sigma_0$. Since the magnitude of the maximum tensile stress ($3\\sigma_0$) is greater than the magnitude of the maximum compressive stress ($\\sigma_0$), the maximum of $\\sigma_{\\theta\\theta}$ and the maximum of $|\\sigma_{\\theta\\theta}|$ occur at the same angular position, $\\theta=\\pm \\pi/2$. Therefore, the locations of the two maxima coincide. This coincidence is a direct consequence of the uniaxial nature of the stress at the traction-free boundary and the fact that the peak tensile stress is larger in magnitude than the peak compressive stress.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{1.000}\n$$", "id": "2920516"}, {"introduction": "While analytical solutions provide profound insight, most engineering geometries are too complex for closed-form analysis and must be solved numerically.

Keep a strongly refined mesh near $r=a$ fixed across runs with element size $h$ such that the discretization error in $\\sigma_{\\theta\\theta}(a,\\theta)$ scales like $\\mathcal{O}(h^{p})$ and is at least one order of magnitude smaller than the observed truncation error. Vary $R/a$ through a sequence, e.g., $R/a \\in \\{2,3,4,6,8\\}$, and for each $R$ compute $K_{t}(R) = \\max_{\\theta}\\sigma_{\\theta\\theta}(a,\\theta)/\\sigma_{0}$. Test the model reduction ansatz $K_{t}(R) = K_{t}^{\\infty} + c_{2} (a/R)^{2} + \\mathcal{O}\\!\\left((a/R)^{4}\\right)$ by plotting $K_{t}(R)$ versus $(a/R)^{2}$ and extracting $K_{t}^{\\infty}$ as the least-squares intercept at $(a/R)^{2} = 0$. Confirm the $(a/R)^{2}$ truncation scaling by demonstrating linearity and stability of the intercept under further reduction of $h$.\n\nB. Impose at $r=R$ a spatially uniform normal traction $t_{r}(R,\\theta) = \\sigma_{0}$ and zero tangential traction $t_{\\theta}(R,\\theta) = 0$. Coarsen and refine the mesh uniformly without special refinement near $r=a$, and vary $R/a \\in \\{2,4,8,16\\}$. Assume $K_{t}(R) = K_{t}^{\\infty} + c_{1} (a/R) + \\mathcal{O}\\!\\left((a/R)^{2}\\right)$ and extrapolate $K_{t}^{\\infty}$ by linear fit of $K_{t}(R)$ versus $(a/R)$.\n\nC. Impose at $r=R$ uniform Cartesian displacements $u_{x}(R,\\theta) = \\sigma_{0} R / E$ and $u_{y}(R,\\theta) = 0$, where $E$ is Young’s modulus, as a surrogate for the far-field. Use a single global mesh parameter $h$ coupled to $R$ via $h = \\alpha R$ with fixed $\\alpha$, vary $R/a$ over $\\{2,3,4,5\\}$, and assume the truncation error decays exponentially in $R$ to extrapolate $K_{t}^{\\infty}$.\n\nD. Impose at $r=R$ the exact analytical traction field of the infinite-domain hole problem (including all angular harmonics beyond the uniform term) so that the outer boundary data matches the true infinite-domain solution at $r=R$. Vary $R/a$ over $\\{2,3,4,6\\}$ with a fixed refined mesh near $r=a$, and verify the truncation error order by fitting $K_{t}(R)$ to $K_{t}^{\\infty} + c_{2} (a/R)^{2}$; report $K_{t}^{\\infty}$ as the intercept.\n\nOnly one option satisfies all of the stated goals and is consistent with the governing principles and asymptotics described above.

The goal is to design a numerical verification study using the Finite Element Method (FEM) on a truncated domain.\n\n-   **Scientifically Grounded**: The problem is based on the well-established theory of linear elasticity. The equilibrium equation, traction definition, and the supplied expressions for far-field stresses in polar coordinates are correct.

I will proceed to analyze the options.\n\n**Solution and Option-by-Option Analysis**\n\nThe core of this problem lies in correctly handling the artificial boundary at $r=R$ to approximate the infinite domain. The error introduced by this truncation must be managed and understood to meet the study's objectives. The problem statement provides the key: the stress field $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}$ can be written as the sum of the far-field term $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}^{\\infty}$ and a disturbance term $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}^{\\text{dist}} = \\mathcal{O}((a/r)^2)$. The exact traction on a circle of radius $R$ is $\\mathbf{t}^{\\text{exact}}(R,\\theta) = (\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}^{\\infty} + \\boldsymbol{\\sigma}^{\\text{dist}}(R,\\theta)) \\cdot \\mathbf{n}$.\n\nA common and sound strategy for creating an approximate boundary condition at $r=R$ is to impose the traction corresponding to the known far-field term, i.e., $\\mathbf{t}^{\\text{approx}}(R,\\theta) = \\boldsymbol{\\sigma}^{\\infty} \\cdot \\mathbf{n}$. The error in this boundary condition is a traction equal to $-\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}^{\\text{dist}}(R,\\theta) \\cdot \\mathbf{n}$, which has a magnitude of $\\mathcal{O}((a/R)^2)$. By Saint-Venant's principle, the error this induces in the stress field at the hole ($r=a$) will also decay with $R$. Specifically, the error in the calculated stress concentration factor, $K_t(R)$, is expected to scale as $\\mathcal{O}((a/R)^2)$. This leads to the expansion $K_{t}(R) = K_{t}^{\\infty} + c (a/R)^2 + \\text{higher order terms}$. A successful verification study must be built upon this understanding.\n\nFurthermore, to study the truncation error (due to finite $R$), the discretization error (due to finite element size $h$) must be made negligible. This requires using a sufficiently fine mesh, especially near the hole where stress gradients are high, and ensuring that any observed convergence with $R$ is not an artifact of an insufficiently refined mesh.\n\n**Analysis of Option A:**\n-   **Boundary Condition**: It proposes imposing the traction derived from the far-field stress, $\\mathbf{t}(R,\\theta) = \\boldsymbol{\\sigma}^{\\infty} \\cdot \\mathbf{n}$. The given polar components, $t_{r}(R,\\theta) = \\sigma_{0} \\cos^{2}\\theta$ and $t_{\\theta}(R,\\theta) = -\\sigma_{0} \\sin\\theta \\cos\\theta$, are the correct expressions for this traction. This is a theoretically sound approach.\n-   **Error Separation**: It correctly proposes to use a fixed, highly refined mesh near the hole to ensure that the discretization error is much smaller than the truncation error being studied. This is the proper way to isolate the effect of varying $R$.\n-   **Verification and Extrapolation**: It proposes using the theoretically justified ansatz $K_{t}(R) = K_{t}^{\\infty} + c_{2} (a/R)^{2} + \\mathcal{O}((a/R)^{4})$. Plotting $K_{t}(R)$ vs $(a/R)^2$ and performing a linear-squares fit to find the intercept at $(a/R)^2=0$ is the standard procedure for Richardson extrapolation to the limit $R \\to \\infty$. This directly addresses objectives (i) and (ii). The final step of confirming the stability of the result with further mesh refinement correctly addresses objective (iii).\n-   **Verdict**: **Correct**. This option describes a methodologically flawless verification study that is fully consistent with the problem's stated principles and goals.\n\n**Analysis of Option B:**\n-   **Boundary Condition**: It proposes a uniform normal traction $t_r=\\sigma_0$ and zero shear traction $t_{\\theta}=0$. This is physically incorrect. The true far-field traction is nonuniform, as correctly stated in the problem's fundamentals. This choice of boundary condition does not properly represent the uniaxial tension state at infinity and introduces a leading-order error, not a small, decaying perturbation.\n-   **Error Separation and Analysis**: It suggests uniform mesh refinement, which is computationally inefficient for this problem. More critically, it assumes an $\\mathcal{O}(a/R)$ truncation error scaling, for which there is no theoretical basis in the provided fundamentals; the expected scaling is $\\mathcal{O}((a/R)^2)$.\n-   **Verdict**: **Incorrect**. The proposed boundary conditions and error model are fundamentally flawed.\n\n**Analysis of Option C:**\n-   **Boundary Condition**: It proposes imposing uniform Cartesian displacements, $u_{x}(R,\\theta) = \\sigma_{0} R / E$ and $u_{y}(R,\\theta) = 0$. This is an incorrect and overly restrictive Dirichlet boundary condition. The displacement field for a uniform stress $\\sigma_{xx}=\\sigma_0$ is affine ($u_x \\propto x$, $u_y \\propto y$), not uniform on a circle. This unphysical constraint introduces large spurious stresses.\n-   **Error Separation**: It proposes coupling the mesh size to the domain size ($h = \\alpha R$), which is a catastrophic methodological error. As one increases $R$ to reduce truncation error, one would simultaneously increase $h$, thus increasing discretization error. This makes it impossible to separate the two error sources.\n-   **Verification and Extrapolation**: It incorrectly assumes an exponential decay of truncation error. For this class of exterior problems, the decay is algebraic, as stated in the problem's fundamentals.\n-   **Verdict**: **Incorrect**. This option is flawed in its choice of boundary condition, its meshing strategy, and its assumed error model.\n\n**Analysis of Option D:**\n-   **Boundary Condition**: It proposes imposing the exact analytical traction field from the infinite-domain solution. This directly violates the problem's constraint: \"do not assume or invoke any closed-form solution\". The purpose of a verification study is often to find a solution that is not known analytically.\n-   **Methodology**: If one imposes the exact traction on the boundary $r=R$, the solution of the boundary value problem in the annulus $a \\le r \\le R$ is, by uniqueness, exactly the restriction of the infinite-domain solution to that annulus. In this setup, there is *no truncation error*. The only error is discretization error from the FEM approximation.\n-   **Verification and Extrapolation**: It then nonsensically proposes to analyze a truncation error term ($c_2(a/R)^2$) which has been designed to be zero. Varying $R$ would have no effect on the result for $K_t$, apart from changes in discretization effects if the mesh is not consistently refined. The proposed analysis plan is completely inconsistent with the boundary condition.\n-   **Verdict**: **Incorrect**. This option is logically inconsistent and violates a core premise of the problem statement. It fails to design a study for truncation error.\n\nBased on the analysis, Option A is the only choice that outlines a correct, rigorous, and theoretically sound verification study that meets all the specified objectives without violating any constraints.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2920506"}]}
