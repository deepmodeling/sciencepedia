The general form of such a polynomial is:\n$$\n\\Phi(x,y) = A x^3 + B x^2 y + C x y^2 + D y^3\n$$\nwhere $A, B, C, D$ are arbitrary real coefficients. To verify if this satisfies the biharmonic equation, we compute its fourth derivatives.\nFirst, compute the Laplacian of $\\Phi$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial^2 \\Phi}{\\partial x^2} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}(3Ax^2 + 2Bxy + Cy^2) = 6Ax + 2By\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial^2 \\Phi}{\\partial y^2} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}(Bx^2 + 2Cxy + 3Dy^2) = 2Cx + 6Dy\n$$\n$$\n\\nabla^2 \\Phi = \\frac{\\partial^2 \\Phi}{\\partial x^2} + \\frac{\\partial^2 \\Phi}{\\partial y^2} = (6Ax + 2By) + (2Cx + 6Dy) = (6A+2C)x + (2B+6D)y\n$$\nNow, apply the Laplacian operator again to $\\nabla^2 \\Phi$:\n$$\n\\nabla^4 \\Phi = \\nabla^2(\\nabla^2 \\Phi) = \\nabla^2\\left((6A+2C)x + (2B+6D)y\\right)\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial x^2}\\left((6A+2C)x + (2B+6D)y\\right) = 0\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial y^2}\\left((6A+2C)x + (2B+6D)y\\right) = 0\n$$\nThus, $\\nabla^4 \\Phi = 0 + 0 = 0$. This result holds for any values of the coefficients $A, B, C, D$. Therefore, any homogeneous polynomial of degree $3$ is a biharmonic function.
