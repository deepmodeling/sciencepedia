To verify if this satisfies the biharmonic equation, we compute its fourth derivatives.\nFirst, compute the Laplacian of $\\Phi$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial^2 \\Phi}{\\partial x^2} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}(3Ax^2 + 2Bxy + Cy^2) = 6Ax + 2By\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial^2 \\Phi}{\\partial y^2} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}(Bx^2 + 2Cxy + 3Dy^2) = 2Cx + 6Dy\n$$\n$$\n\\nabla^2 \\Phi = \\frac{\\partial^2 \\Phi}{\\partial x^2} + \\frac{\\partial^2 \\Phi}{\\partial y^2} = (6Ax + 2By) + (2Cx + 6Dy) = (6A+2C)x + (2B+6D)y\n$$\nNow, apply the Laplacian operator again to $\\nabla^2 \\Phi$:\n$$\n\\nabla^4 \\Phi = \\nabla^2(\\nabla^2 \\Phi) = \\nabla^2\\left((6A+2C)x + (2B+6D)y\\right)\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial x^2}\\left((6A+2C)x + (2B+6D)y\\right) = 0\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial y^2}\\left((6A+2C)x + (2B+6D)y\\right) = 0\n$$\nThus, $\\nabla^4 \\Phi = 0 + 0 = 0$.
