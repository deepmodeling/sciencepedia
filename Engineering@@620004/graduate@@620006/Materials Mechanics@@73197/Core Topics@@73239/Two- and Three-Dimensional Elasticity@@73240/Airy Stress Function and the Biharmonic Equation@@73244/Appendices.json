It is solvable using fundamental dimensional analysis.\n\nThe objective is to determine the physical dimension of the Airy stress function, $\\phi$, expressed in terms of the base dimensions of mass ($M$), length ($L$), and time ($T$). The dimensional form is given as $[\\phi] = M^{a}L^{b}T^{c}$, and the exponents $(a, b, c)$ must be found.\n\nFirst, we establish the dimension of the Cauchy stress, $\\sigma$. The problem states that stress has the dimension of force per unit area.\nThe dimension of force, $[F]$, is derived from Newton's second law, $F=ma$. The dimension of mass is $M$, and the dimension of acceleration is length per time squared, $L T^{-2}$.\nTherefore, the dimension of force is:\n$$[F] = [mass] \\times [acceleration] = M L T^{-2}$$\nThe dimension of area, $[A]$, is length squared, $L^2$.\nThe dimension of stress, $[\\sigma]$, is then:\n$$[\\sigma] = \\frac{[F]}{[A]} = \\frac{M L T^{-2}}{L^2} = M L^{-1} T^{-2}$$\n\nNext, we use the relationship between the stress tensor and the Airy stress function.

A spatial derivative operator, such as $\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}$, has the dimension of inverse length, $L^{-1}$. Consequently, a second-order spatial derivative operator, such as $\\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial x^2}$ or $\\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial x \\partial y}$, must have the dimension of $(L^{-1})^{2} = L^{-2}$.\n\nFor the defining equations to be dimensionally consistent, the dimension of stress must be equal to the dimension of the second derivative of $\\phi$.\n$$[\\sigma] = \\left[\\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial x_i \\partial x_j}\\right] [\\phi]$$\nSubstituting the known dimensions:\n$$M L^{-1} T^{-2} = L^{-2} \\cdot [\\phi]$$\nWe can now solve for the dimension of the Airy stress function, $[\\phi]$:\n$$[\\phi] = (M L^{-1} T^{-2}) \\cdot L^{2} = M L^{-1+2} T^{-2} = M^{1} L^{1} T^{-2}$$\nThis result indicates that the Airy stress function has the physical dimension of force.\n\nBy comparing this result to the required form $[\\phi] = M^{a}L^{b}T^{c}$, we can identify the exponents:\n$$a = 1$$\n$$b = 1$$\n$$c = -2$$\n\nAs a consistency check, we examine the biharmonic equation, which the Airy function must satisfy in the absence of body forces:\n$$\\nabla^4 \\phi = 0$$\nwhere $\\nabla^4$ is the biharmonic operator, $\\nabla^4 = \\frac{\\partial^4}{\\partial x^4} + 2\\frac{\\partial^4}{\\partial x^2 \\partial y^2} + \\frac{\\partial^4}{\\partial y^4}$. Each term in this operator involves a fourth spatial derivative.

This is a physically and dimensionally consistent statement, as the zero on the right-hand side must be interpreted as a zero value of the same physical quantity.

The integration procedure and application of uniqueness conditions are identical to the plane stress case. The resulting displacement field for plane strain is:\n$$\nu^{\\mathrm{pe}}(x,y) = \\epsilon_{xx}^{\\mathrm{pe}} x = \\frac{1+\\nu}{E}((1-\\nu)\\sigma_{x}^{0} - \\nu\\sigma_{y}^{0})x\n$$\n$$\nv^{\\mathrm{pe}}(x,y) = \\epsilon_{yy}^{\\mathrm{pe}} y = \\frac{1+\\nu}{E}((1-\\nu)\\sigma_{y}^{0} - \\nu\\sigma_{x}^{0})y\n$$\n\n(c) Commentary on the differences between the displacement fields.\n\nThe displacement fields for plane stress and plane strain are both linear in the coordinates $x$ and $y$, but the coefficients, representing the uniform strains, differ. The fundamental reason for this difference lies in the treatment of the out-of-plane ($z$-direction) behavior.\n\nIn plane stress, the body is thin and free to deform in the $z$-direction ($\\sigma_{zz}=0$). The in-plane strains are thus only a result of the in-plane stresses $\\sigma_x^0, \\sigma_y^0$ and the direct Poisson contraction/expansion they cause.\n\nIn plane strain, the body is thick and constrained against deformation in the $z$-direction ($\\epsilon_{zz}=0$). To enforce this constraint, a reaction stress $\\sigma_{zz} = \\nu(\\sigma_x^0+\\sigma_y^0)$ develops. This out-of-plane stress itself causes additional in-plane strain through the Poisson effect. For example, the contribution to $\\epsilon_{xx}$ from $\\sigma_{zz}$ is $-\\frac{\\nu}{E}\\sigma_{zz} = -\\frac{\\nu^2}{E}(\\sigma_x^0+\\sigma_y^0)$. This term accounts for the difference between $\\epsilon_{xx}^{\\mathrm{pe}}$ and $\\epsilon_{xx}^{\\mathrm{ps}}$.\n\nConsequently, for a given applied biaxial stress state $\\{\\sigma_x^0, \\sigma_y^0\\}$, a body under plane strain is effectively stiffer in the $x$-$y$ plane than a body under plane stress. This is evident by comparing the strain expressions; the magnitude of strain (and thus displacement) for a given stress is smaller in the plane strain case. For example, under uniaxial tension $\\sigma_x^0 > 0$ with $\\sigma_y^0=0$, the longitudinal strain is $\\epsilon_{xx}^{\\mathrm{ps}}=\\sigma_x^0/E$ for plane stress, but a smaller value $\\epsilon_{xx}^{\\mathrm{pe}}=(1-\\nu^2)\\sigma_x^0/E$ for plane strain, since $0 < \\nu < 0.5$ for most engineering materials.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{1}{E}(\\sigma_{x}^{0} - \\nu\\sigma_{y}^{0})x & \\frac{1}{E}(\\sigma_{y}^{0} - \\nu\\sigma_{x}^{0})y & \\frac{1+\\nu}{E}((1-\\nu)\\sigma_{x}^{0} - \\nu\\sigma_{y}^{0})x & \\frac{1+\\nu}{E}((1-\\nu)\\sigma_{y}^{0} - \\nu\\sigma_{x}^{0})y \\end{pmatrix}}\n$$", "id": "2614037"}, {"introduction": "This final practice presents a capstone challenge: solving the classic Kirsch problem of stress concentration around a circular hole.
