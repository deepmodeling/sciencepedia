It requires the derivation of the torsion constant for an elliptical bar from first principles using the Prandtl stress function approach.

Using Hooke's law, these are related to the engineering shear strains $\\gamma_{xz}$ and $\\gamma_{yz}$:\n$$ \\gamma_{xz} = \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial z} + \\frac{\\partial w}{\\partial x} = -\\theta' y + \\frac{\\partial \\psi}{\\partial x} \\implies \\tau_{xz} = G \\gamma_{xz} = G \\left( \\frac{\\partial \\psi}{\\partial x} - \\theta' y \\right) $$\n$$ \\gamma_{yz} = \\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial z} + \\frac{\\partial w}{\\partial y} = \\theta' x + \\frac{\\partial \\psi}{\\partial y} \\implies \\tau_{yz} = G \\gamma_{yz} = G \\left( \\frac{\\partial \\psi}{\\partial y} + \\theta' x \\right) $$\nwhere $G$ is the shear modulus.\n\nThe equilibrium equation, in the absence of body forces, for the $z$-direction is $\\frac{\\partial \\tau_{xz}}{\\partial x} + \\frac{\\partial \\tau_{yz}}{\\partial y} + \\frac{\\partial \\sigma_{zz}}{\\partial z} = 0$. For pure torsion, all normal stresses are zero, so $\\sigma_{zz}=0$. The equilibrium equation simplifies to:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial \\tau_{xz}}{\\partial x} + \\frac{\\partial \\tau_{yz}}{\\partial y} = 0 $$\nThis equation is satisfied identically by introducing the Prandtl stress function, $\\phi(x,y)$, defined such that:\n$$ \\tau_{xz} = \\frac{\\partial \\phi}{\\partial y} $$\n$$ \\tau_{yz} = -\\frac{\\partial \\phi}{\\partial x} $$\n\nNow, we derive the governing Partial Differential Equation (PDE) for $\\phi(x,y)$.

From the first equation, $\\frac{\\partial^2 \\psi}{\\partial y \\partial x} = \\frac{1}{G}\\frac{\\partial^2 \\phi}{\\partial y^2} + \\theta'$. From the second, $\\frac{\\partial^2 \\psi}{\\partial x \\partial y} = -\\frac{1}{G}\\frac{\\partial^2 \\phi}{\\partial x^2} - \\theta'$. Equating these:\n$$ \\frac{1}{G}\\frac{\\partial^2 \\phi}{\\partial y^2} + \\theta' = -\\frac{1}{G}\\frac{\\partial^2 \\phi}{\\partial x^2} - \\theta' $$\nRearranging gives the governing PDE for the stress function, which is a Poisson's equation:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial^2 \\phi}{\\partial x^2} + \\frac{\\partial^2 \\phi}{\\partial y^2} = -2 G \\theta' $$\nThe boundary condition is that the lateral surface of the bar is traction-free. The traction vector has a component in the $z$-direction equal to $t_z = \\tau_{xz} n_x + \\tau_{yz} n_y$, where $(n_x, n_y)$ are the components of the outward unit normal to the boundary curve of the cross-section. Setting $t_z = 0$:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial \\phi}{\\partial y} n_x - \\frac{\\partial \\phi}{\\partial x} n_y = 0 $$\nFor a boundary curve parameterized by arc length $s$, we have $n_x = \\frac{dy}{ds}$ and $n_y = -\\frac{dx}{ds}$. Substituting these gives:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial \\phi}{\\partial y} \\frac{dy}{ds} + \\frac{\\partial \\phi}{\\partial x} \\frac{dx}{ds} = \\frac{d\\phi}{ds} = 0 $$\nThis implies that $\\phi$ is constant along the boundary. As the stresses depend only on the derivatives of $\\phi$, we can set this constant to zero without loss of generality. So, for the elliptical cross-section defined by $\\frac{x^2}{a^2} + \\frac{y^2}{b^2} = 1$:\n$$ \\phi(x,y) = 0 \\quad \\text{on} \\quad \\frac{x^2}{a^2} + \\frac{y^2}{b^2} = 1 $$\n\nWe must now solve this boundary-value problem. We posit a solution of the form:\n$$ \\phi(x,y) = C \\left( \\frac{x^2}{a^2} + \\frac{y^2}{b^2} - 1 \\right) $$\nThis choice automatically satisfies the boundary condition $\\phi=0$ on the ellipse. We determine the constant $C$ by substituting this form into the governing PDE. We compute the second partial derivatives:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial^2 \\phi}{\\partial x^2} = \\frac{2C}{a^2} $$\n$$ \\frac{\\partial^2 \\phi}{\\partial y^2} = \\frac{2C}{b^2} $$\nSubstituting into the Poisson's equation gives:\n$$ \\frac{2C}{a^2} + \\frac{2C}{b^2} = 2C \\left( \\frac{1}{a^2} + \\frac{1}{b^2} \\right) = 2C \\frac{a^2+b^2}{a^2 b^2} = -2 G \\theta' $$\nSolving for $C$:\n$$ C = -G \\theta' \\frac{a^2 b^2}{a^2+b^2} $$\nTherefore, the stress function for the elliptical cross-section is:\n$$ \\phi(x,y) = -G \\theta' \\frac{a^2 b^2}{a^2+b^2} \\left( \\frac{x^2}{a^2} + \\frac{y^2}{b^2} - 1 \\right) $$\n\nNext, we derive the expression for the applied torque $T$. The torque is the resultant moment of the shear stresses integrated over the cross-sectional area $A$:\n$$ T = \\iint_A (x \\tau_{yz} - y \\tau_{xz}) \\,dx\\,dy $$\nSubstituting the definitions of stresses in terms of $\\phi$:\n$$ T = \\iint_A \\left( x \\left( -\\frac{\\partial \\phi}{\\partial x} \\right) - y \\left( \\frac{\\partial \\phi}{\\partial y} \\right) \\right) \\,dx\\,dy = -\\iint_A \\left( x \\frac{\\partial \\phi}{\\partial x} + y \\frac{\\partial \\phi}{\\partial y} \\right) \\,dx\\,dy $$\nWe use integration by parts (a consequence of Green's theorem). For the first term:\n$$ \\iint_A x \\frac{\\partial \\phi}{\\partial x} \\,dx\\,dy = \\iint_A \\left( \\frac{\\partial(x\\phi)}{\\partial x} - \\phi \\right) \\,dx\\,dy = \\oint_{\\partial A} x\\phi \\,dy - \\iint_A \\phi \\,dx\\,dy $$\nSince $\\phi=0$ on the boundary $\\partial A$, the line integral vanishes. Thus, $\\iint_A x \\frac{\\partial \\phi}{\\partial x} \\,dx\\,dy = - \\iint_A \\phi \\,dx\\,dy$. By a similar argument, $\\iint_A y \\frac{\\partial \\phi}{\\partial y} \\,dx\\,dy = - \\iint_A \\phi \\,dx\\,dy$.\nSubstituting these results back into the expression for torque:\n$$ T = - \\left( -\\iint_A \\phi \\,dx\\,dy - \\iint_A \\phi \\,dx\\,dy \\right) = 2 \\iint_A \\phi \\,dx\\,dy $$\nNow, we compute this integral for the elliptical section:\n$$ T = 2 \\iint_A \\left[ -G \\theta' \\frac{a^2 b^2}{a^2+b^2} \\left( \\frac{x^2}{a^2} + \\frac{y^2}{b^2} - 1 \\right) \\right] \\,dx\\,dy $$\n$$ T = -2 G \\theta' \\frac{a^2 b^2}{a^2+b^2} \\iint_A \\left( \\frac{x^2}{a^2} + \\frac{y^2}{b^2} - 1 \\right) \\,dx\\,dy $$\nThe integral can be evaluated using known properties of the area moments of inertia of an ellipse, $I_y = \\iint_A x^2 \\,dA = \\frac{\\pi a^3 b}{4}$ and $I_x = \\iint_A y^2 \\,dA = \\frac{\\pi a b^3}{4}$, and the area $A = \\pi ab$:\n$$ \\iint_A \\left( \\frac{x^2}{a^2} + \\frac{y^2}{b^2} - 1 \\right) \\,dA = \\frac{1}{a^2}\\iint_A x^2 \\,dA + \\frac{1}{b^2}\\iint_A y^2 \\,dA - \\iint_A 1 \\,dA $$\n$$ = \\frac{1}{a^2} \\left( \\frac{\\pi a^3 b}{4} \\right) + \\frac{1}{b^2} \\left( \\frac{\\pi a b^3}{4} \\right) - \\pi ab = \\frac{\\pi ab}{4} + \\frac{\\pi ab}{4} - \\pi ab = -\\frac{\\pi ab}{2} $$\nSubstituting this result into the expression for $T$:\n$$ T = -2 G \\theta' \\frac{a^2 b^2}{a^2+b^2} \\left( -\\frac{\\pi ab}{2} \\right) = G \\theta' \\frac{\\pi a^3 b^3}{a^2+b^2} $$\n\nFinally, we identify the torsion constant $J_t$, which is defined by the relation $T = G J_t \\theta'$.

It is a textbook example from the theory of elasticity, free of any scientific, logical, or structural flaws. I will proceed with the solution.\n\n### Derivation and Analysis\n\nThe problem requires a comparison of the torsional rigidity, represented by the torsion constant $J$, for a circular and a square cross-section of equal area $A$. The torque $T$ is related to the twist per unit length $\\theta$ by $T = G J \\theta$. For a given material ($G$) and twist ($\\theta$), the torque is directly proportional to $J$. Therefore, a larger $J$ corresponds to a stiffer bar in torsion.\n\nLet $J_{\\circ}$ be the torsion constant for the circular cross-section and $J_{\\square}$ be the torsion constant for the square cross-section.\n\n**1. Torsion Constant for a Circular Cross-Section**\n\nFor a circle of radius $r$, the cross-sectional area is $A = \\pi r^2$.\nIn the special case of a circular cross-section, the torsion constant $J_{\\circ}$ is equal to the polar second moment of area, $I_{p, \\circ}$.\n$$I_{p, \\circ} = \\frac{\\pi r^4}{2}$$\nTo express $J_{\\circ}$ in terms of the area $A$, we first write $r^2 = A/\\pi$. Squaring this gives $r^4 = (A/\\pi)^2 = A^2/\\pi^2$.\nSubstituting this into the expression for $J_{\\circ}$:\n$$J_{\\circ} = \\frac{\\pi}{2} \\left( \\frac{A^2}{\\pi^2} \\right) = \\frac{A^2}{2\\pi}$$\n\n**2. Torsion Constant for a Square Cross-Section**\n\nFor a square of side length $a$, the cross-sectional area is $A = a^2$.\nFor a non-circular cross-section, the torsion constant $J$ is not equal to the polar second moment of area. The solution to the governing Poisson equation for the Prandtl stress function yields a value for $J_{\\square}$ of the form:\n$$J_{\\square} = k a^4$$\nwhere $k$ is a numerical coefficient. The established value for a square cross-section is $k \\approx 0.1406$.\nTo express $J_{\\square}$ in terms of the area $A$, we use $a^2 = A$, which implies $a^4 = A^2$.\nSubstituting this, we get:\n$$J_{\\square} \\approx 0.1406 A^2$$\n\n**3. Quantitative Comparison**\n\nWe can now compute the ratio $J_{\\circ}/J_{\\square}$.\n$$ \\frac{J_{\\circ}}{J_{\\square}} = \\frac{A^2/(2\\pi)}{k A^2} = \\frac{1}{2\\pi k} $$\nUsing the numerical values $\\pi \\approx 3.14159$ and $k \\approx 0.1406$:\n$$ \\frac{J_{\\circ}}{J_{\\square}} \\approx \\frac{1}{2 \\times 3.14159 \\times 0.1406} \\approx \\frac{1}{0.8831} \\approx 1.1324 $$\nThus, for the same cross-sectional area, the circular bar is approximately $13\\%$ stiffer in torsion than the square bar. The ratio is approximately $1.13$.\n\n**4. Mechanistic Role of Corners**\n\nThe Prandtl stress function analogy is instructive. The function $\\phi(x,y)$ can be visualized as the deflection of an elastic membrane stretched over the boundary of the cross-section and inflated by a uniform pressure. The boundary condition $\\phi=0$ means the membrane is fixed at its edge. The torsional rigidity $J$ is proportional to the volume enclosed by this deflected membrane.\n\n- **Saint-Venant's Isoperimetric Inequality**: This theorem states that, among all simply connected cross-sectional shapes of a given area, the circle maximizes the torsional rigidity $J$. Our calculation, which shows $J_{\\circ} > J_{\\square}$, is consistent with this theorem. The circular boundary is the most efficient shape for enclosing volume in the membrane analogy, thus maximizing $J$.\n\n- **Effect of Corners**: For a square cross-section, the boundary consists of four straight lines meeting at sharp, convex corners. The condition $\\phi=0$ must hold along these lines. At a corner, where two such lines meet, the gradient of the stress function, $\\nabla\\phi$, must be zero because $\\phi$ is constant (zero) along both intersecting boundary lines. The shear stress components are given by $\\tau_{zx} = \\partial\\phi/\\partial y$ and $\\tau_{zy} = -\\partial\\phi/\\partial x$. Since $\\nabla\\phi = 0$ at the corners, the shear stress must be zero at the convex corners of the square. These corners are therefore ineffective at carrying load. This inefficiency, compared to the circular shape where stress is maximum at the boundary and uniform along it, leads to a reduction in the overall torsional rigidity ($J$). It is critical to note that stress singularities arise at *re-entrant* (concave) corners, not at *convex* corners.\n\n### Evaluation of Options\n\n**A) $J_{\\circ}/J_{\\square} \\approx 0.95$; the square is stiffer because its polar second moment of area is larger than the circle’s for the same area, and sharp corners help carry shear flow.**\n- The ratio $J_{\\circ}/J_{\\square} \\approx 0.95$ is incorrect.

Shear stresses are zero at convex corners; singularities occur at re-entrant corners.\n- **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D) $J_{\\circ}/J_{\\square} = 1$ exactly; under Saint-Venant torsion the torsional rigidity depends only on cross-sectional area, not on shape, so corners play no role.**\n- The ratio $J_{\\circ}/J_{\\square} = 1$ is incorrect.\n- The claim that torsional rigidity is independent of shape for a given area is fundamentally false for non-circular sections. This contradicts the entire theory of Saint-Venant torsion.\n- **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**E) $J_{\\circ}/J_{\\square} \\approx 0.88$; the square is stiffer because for any shape the torsion constant equals the polar second moment of area.**\n- The ratio $J_{\\circ}/J_{\\square} \\approx 0.88$ is incorrect.\n- The claim that the square is stiffer is incorrect.\n- The claim that $J$ equals the polar second moment of area ($I_p$) for any shape is fundamentally false.

For Saint-Venant torsion, the displacement field $\\mathbf{u}$ has the form $u_x = -\\theta' y z$, $u_y = \\theta' x z$, and $u_z = \\psi(x,y)$, where $\\theta'$ is the constant rate of twist per unit length and $\\psi(x,y)$ is the warping function. The non-zero strain components, from the linear strain-displacement relations $\\varepsilon_{ij} = \\frac{1}{2}(\\partial_j u_i + \\partial_i u_j)$, are:\n$$\n\\varepsilon_{xz} = \\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\frac{\\partial\\psi}{\\partial x} - \\theta' y\\right), \\quad \\varepsilon_{yz} = \\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\frac{\\partial\\psi}{\\partial y} + \\theta' x\\right)\n$$\nFor a homogeneous, isotropic, linearly elastic material with shear modulus $G$, the constitutive law gives the non-zero stress components as $\\sigma_{ij} = 2G\\varepsilon_{ij}$:\n$$\n\\sigma_{xz} = G\\left(\\frac{\\partial\\psi}{\\partial x} - \\theta' y\\right), \\quad \\sigma_{yz} = G\\left(\\frac{\\partial\\psi}{\\partial y} + \\theta' x\\right)\n$$\nThe equilibrium equations in the absence of body forces, $\\nabla\\cdot\\boldsymbol{\\sigma} = \\mathbf{0}$, reduce to a single non-trivial equation $\\frac{\\partial\\sigma_{xz}}{\\partial x} + \\frac{\\partial\\sigma_{yz}}{\\partial y} = 0$, which upon substitution yields Laplace's equation for the warping function: $\\nabla^2\\psi = 0$ on the cross-section $\\Omega$.\n\nAn alternative and more direct approach is to use the Prandtl stress function, $\\phi(x,y)$, defined such that the equilibrium equation is automatically satisfied. We set:\n$$\n\\sigma_{xz} = \\frac{\\partial\\phi}{\\partial y}, \\qquad \\sigma_{yz} = -\\frac{\\partial\\phi}{\\partial x}\n$$\nThe compatibility of strains requires relating the stress components back to the displacements. This leads to the governing Poisson's equation for the stress function:\n$$\n\\nabla^2\\phi = -2G\\theta'\n$$\nThe boundary condition on the traction-free lateral surface $\\partial\\Omega$ is $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}\\cdot\\mathbf{n}=0$, where $\\mathbf{n} = (n_x, n_y, 0)$ is the outward normal to the boundary curve in the $xy$-plane. This translates to $\\sigma_{xz}n_x + \\sigma_{yz}n_y = 0$, which in terms of $\\phi$ becomes $\\frac{\\partial\\phi}{\\partial y}n_x - \\frac{\\partial\\phi}{\\partial x}n_y = 0$. This implies that the directional derivative of $\\phi$ along the boundary is zero, so $\\phi$ must be constant on $\\partial\\Omega$. Without loss of generality, we set this constant to zero, yielding the homogeneous Dirichlet boundary condition $\\phi=0$ on $\\partial\\Omega$.\n\nThe total applied torque $T$ is the resultant of the shear stresses over the cross-section:\n$$\nT = \\int_{\\Omega} (x\\sigma_{yz} - y\\sigma_{xz}) \\,\\mathrm{d}A = \\int_{\\Omega} \\left(-x\\frac{\\partial\\phi}{\\partial x} - y\\frac{\\partial\\phi}{\\partial y}\\right)\\,\\mathrm{d}A\n$$\nUsing integration by parts (Green's first identity), and noting that $\\phi=0$ on $\\partial\\Omega$, we find:\n$$\nT = \\int_{\\Omega} \\phi\\,\\mathrm{d}A + \\int_{\\Omega} \\phi\\,\\mathrm{d}A = 2\\int_{\\Omega} \\phi\\,\\mathrm{d}A\n$$\nThe torsional rigidity $J$ is defined by the relation $T = G J \\theta'$. Thus, $J = \\frac{T}{G\\theta'} = \\frac{2}{G\\theta'}\\int_{\\Omega}\\phi\\,\\mathrm{d}A$. Let us define a rescaled potential $u(x,y) = \\phi/(G\\theta')$. This potential $u$ satisfies the BVP:\n$$\n\\nabla^2 u = -2 \\quad \\text{in } \\Omega, \\qquad u = 0 \\quad \\text{on } \\partial\\Omega\n$$\nThe torsional rigidity is then expressed in terms of $u$ as $J = 2\\int_{\\Omega}u\\,\\mathrm{d}A$.\n\nSecond, we derive the variational lower bound. Let $u_0$ be the exact solution to the BVP $\\nabla^2 u = -2$ with $u=0$ on $\\partial\\Omega$. Let $v(x,y)$ be any sufficiently smooth trial function that also vanishes on the boundary $\\partial\\Omega$. We begin with the integral of the trial function over the domain:\n$$\n\\int_{\\Omega} v\\,\\mathrm{d}A = \\int_{\\Omega} v \\left(\\frac{\\nabla^2 u_0}{-2}\\right)\\,\\mathrm{d}A = -\\frac{1}{2} \\int_{\\Omega} v \\nabla^2 u_0 \\,\\mathrm{d}A\n$$\nUsing Green's second identity, $\\int_{\\Omega}(v\\nabla^2 u_0 - u_0\\nabla^2 v)\\,\\mathrm{d}A = \\int_{\\partial\\Omega}(v\\frac{\\partial u_0}{\\partial n} - u_0\\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial n})\\,\\mathrm{d}s$, and noting that both $u_0$ and $v$ are zero on the boundary $\\partial\\Omega$, the boundary integral vanishes. Thus, $\\int_{\\Omega} v\\nabla^2 u_0 \\,\\mathrm{d}A = \\int_{\\Omega} u_0\\nabla^2 v \\,\\mathrm{d}A$. This gives:\n$$\n\\int_{\\Omega} v\\,\\mathrm{d}A = -\\frac{1}{2} \\int_{\\Omega} u_0 \\nabla^2 v \\,\\mathrm{d}A\n$$\nApplying Green's first identity, $\\int_{\\Omega} u_0 \\nabla^2 v \\,\\mathrm{d}A = -\\int_{\\Omega} \\nabla u_0 \\cdot \\nabla v \\,\\mathrm{d}A + \\int_{\\partial\\Omega} u_0 \\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial n}\\,\\mathrm{d}s$. Again, the boundary term is zero. Therefore:\n$$\n\\int_{\\Omega} v\\,\\mathrm{d}A = \\frac{1}{2} \\int_{\\Omega} \\nabla u_0 \\cdot \\nabla v \\,\\mathrm{d}A\n$$\nWe now apply the Cauchy–Schwarz inequality for integrals: $(\\int f g)^2 \\le (\\int f^2)(\\int g^2)$.\n$$\n\\left(\\int_{\\Omega} v\\,\\mathrm{d}A\\right)^2 = \\frac{1}{4}\\left(\\int_{\\Omega} \\nabla u_0 \\cdot \\nabla v \\,\\mathrm{d}A\\right)^2 \\le \\frac{1}{4}\\left(\\int_{\\Omega} |\\nabla u_0|^2 \\,\\mathrm{d}A\\right)\\left(\\int_{\\Omega} |\\nabla v|^2 \\,\\mathrm{d}A\\right)\n$$\nFor the exact solution $u_0$, we can show that $\\int_{\\Omega} |\\nabla u_0|^2 \\,\\mathrm{d}A = J$. Using Green's first identity again:\n$$\n\\int_{\\Omega} |\\nabla u_0|^2 \\,\\mathrm{d}A = -\\int_{\\Omega} u_0 \\nabla^2 u_0 \\,\\mathrm{d}A + \\int_{\\partial\\Omega} u_0\\frac{\\partial u_0}{\\partial n}\\,\\mathrm{d}s = -\\int_{\\Omega} u_0(-2)\\,\\mathrm{d}A = 2\\int_{\\Omega} u_0\\,\\mathrm{d}A = J\n$$\nSubstituting this into the inequality, we obtain:\n$$\n\\left(\\int_{\\Omega} v\\,\\mathrm{d}A\\right)^2 \\le \\frac{J}{4} \\int_{\\Omega} |\\nabla v|^2 \\,\\mathrm{d}A\n$$\nRearranging this inequality provides the desired variational lower bound for the torsional rigidity $J$:\n$$\nJ \\ge \\frac{4\\left(\\displaystyle\\int_{\\Omega} v\\,\\mathrm{d}A\\right)^{2}}{\\displaystyle\\int_{\\Omega} |\\nabla v|^{2}\\,\\mathrm{d}A}\n$$\n\nThird, we evaluate this lower bound for the specified rectangular cross-section $\\Omega = [-a, a] \\times [-b, b]$ and the trial function $v(x,y) = (1 - \\frac{x^2}{a^2})(1 - \\frac{y^2}{b^2})$. We must compute two integrals. The first is the integral of $v$ over $\\Omega$:\n$$\n\\int_{\\Omega} v\\,\\mathrm{d}A = \\int_{-a}^{a} \\int_{-b}^{b} \\left(1 - \\frac{x^2}{a^2}\\right)\\left(1 - \\frac{y^2}{b^2}\\right)\\mathrm{d}y\\,\\mathrm{d}x = \\left[\\int_{-a}^{a} \\left(1-\\frac{x^2}{a^2}\\right)\\mathrm{d}x\\right] \\left[\\int_{-b}^{b} \\left(1-\\frac{y^2}{b^2}\\right)\\mathrm{d}y\\right]\n$$\nThe integral in $x$ evaluates to $\\left[x - \\frac{x^3}{3a^2}\\right]_{-a}^a = (a - \\frac{a}{3}) - (-a + \\frac{a}{3}) = \\frac{4a}{3}$. The integral in $y$ is analogous, yielding $\\frac{4b}{3}$. Thus:\n$$\n\\int_{\\Omega} v\\,\\mathrm{d}A = \\left(\\frac{4a}{3}\\right)\\left(\\frac{4b}{3}\\right) = \\frac{16ab}{9}\n$$\nThe second integral involves the squared magnitude of the gradient of $v$. The partial derivatives are:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial x} = -\\frac{2x}{a^2}\\left(1-\\frac{y^2}{b^2}\\right), \\qquad \\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial y} = -\\frac{2y}{b^2}\\left(1-\\frac{x^2}{a^2}\\right)\n$$\nThen $|\\nabla v|^2 = (\\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial x})^2 + (\\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial y})^2 = \\frac{4x^2}{a^4}(1-\\frac{y^2}{b^2})^2 + \\frac{4y^2}{b^4}(1-\\frac{x^2}{a^2})^2$. We integrate this over $\\Omega$:\n$$\n\\int_{\\Omega} |\\nabla v|^2\\,\\mathrm{d}A = \\int_{-a}^{a}\\int_{-b}^{b} \\left[\\frac{4x^2}{a^4}\\left(1-\\frac{y^2}{b^2}\\right)^2 + \\frac{4y^2}{b^4}\\left(1-\\frac{x^2}{a^2}\\right)^2\\right] \\mathrm{d}y\\,\\mathrm{d}x\n$$\nThis splits into two terms. The first term is:\n$$\n\\frac{4}{a^4}\\left(\\int_{-a}^{a}x^2\\,\\mathrm{d}x\\right)\\left(\\int_{-b}^{b}\\left(1-\\frac{y^2}{b^2}\\right)^2\\mathrm{d}y\\right) = \\frac{4}{a^4}\\left(\\frac{2a^3}{3}\\right)\\left(\\frac{16b}{15}\\right) = \\frac{128b}{45a}\n$$\nwhere we used $\\int_{-b}^{b}(1 - 2\\frac{y^2}{b^2} + \\frac{y^4}{b^4})\\,\\mathrm{d}y = [y - \\frac{2y^3}{3b^2} + \\frac{y^5}{5b^4}]_{-b}^b = 2(b - \\frac{2b}{3} + \\frac{b}{5}) = \\frac{16b}{15}$. By symmetry, the second term is $\\frac{128a}{45b}$. So the integral is:\n$$\n\\int_{\\Omega} |\\nabla v|^2\\,\\mathrm{d}A = \\frac{128b}{45a} + \\frac{128a}{45b} = \\frac{128}{45}\\left(\\frac{b}{a}+\\frac{a}{b}\\right) = \\frac{128(a^2+b^2)}{45ab}\n$$\nSubstituting these integrals into the variational formula yields the lower bound on torsional rigidity, $J_{\\mathrm{lb}}$:\n$$\nJ_{\\mathrm{lb}} = \\frac{4\\left(\\frac{16ab}{9}\\right)^2}{\\frac{128(a^2+b^2)}{45ab}} = \\frac{4 \\cdot 256 \\cdot a^2 b^2}{81} \\cdot \\frac{45ab}{128(a^2+b^2)} = \\frac{4 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 45}{81} \\frac{a^3 b^3}{a^2+b^2} = \\frac{360}{81} \\frac{a^3 b^3}{a^2+b^2} = \\frac{40}{9} \\frac{a^3 b^3}{a^2+b^2}\n$$\nFinally, we compute the lower bound for the dimensionless parameter $\\eta = \\frac{J(a^2+b^2)}{a^3b^3}$. Using our result for $J_{\\mathrm{lb}}$:\n$$\n\\eta_{\\mathrm{lb}} = \\frac{J_{\\mathrm{lb}}(a^2+b^2)}{a^3b^3} = \\frac{\\left(\\frac{40}{9} \\frac{a^3b^3}{a^2+b^2}\\right)(a^2+b^2)}{a^3b^3} = \\frac{40}{9}\n$$\nThis is the final simplified analytic expression for the lower bound of the dimensionless torsional rigidity parameter.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\frac{40}{9}}\n$$", "id": "2927239"}]}
