The problem is well-posed, scientifically grounded, and contains all necessary information for its solution. Therefore, it is valid.\n\nFirst, we must demonstrate from first principles that the warping function, $w(x,y)$, must be harmonic in the domain $\\Omega$. The starting point is the differential equations of equilibrium in the absence of body forces, which state that the divergence of the stress tensor must be zero: $\\nabla \\cdot \\boldsymbol{\\sigma} = \\mathbf{0}$. In component form, this is $\\partial_{j}\\sigma_{ij}=0$ for $i \\in \\{x,y,z\\}$. For Saint-Venant torsion, the only non-zero stress components are the shear stresses $\\sigma_{xz}$ and $\\sigma_{yz}$ (which I will denote by $\\tau_{xz}$ and $\\tau_{yz}$ respectively, as is common in mechanics). The stresses are also assumed to be independent of the longitudinal coordinate $z$. Under these assumptions, the equilibrium equations reduce to a single non-trivial equation:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial \\tau_{xz}}{\\partial x} + \\frac{\\partial \\tau_{yz}}{\\partial y} = 0\n$$\nThe problem specifies an isotropic, linear elastic material. The constitutive relations connect the shear stresses to the shear strains via the shear modulus, $G$. The problem states the shear strains are $\\gamma_{xz}=\\partial_{x} w - y$ and $\\gamma_{yz}=\\partial_{y} w + x$, based on a unit twist per unit length ($\\theta=1$). The stresses are thus given by:\n$$\n\\tau_{xz} = G \\gamma_{xz} = G \\left( \\frac{\\partial w}{\\partial x} - y \\right)\n$$\n$$\n\\tau_{yz} = G \\gamma_{yz} = G \\left( \\frac{\\partial w}{\\partial y} + x \\right)\n$$\nSubstituting these constitutive relations into the equilibrium equation yields:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} \\left[ G \\left( \\frac{\\partial w}{\\partial x} - y \\right) \\right] + \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y} \\left[ G \\left( \\frac{\\partial w}{\\partial y} + x \\right) \\right] = 0\n$$\nFor a homogeneous material, the shear modulus $G$ is a constant.

It is scientifically grounded and contains sufficient information for a unique solution. We shall proceed.\n\nThe fundamental task is to establish and solve the governing differential equation for the angle of twist, $\\theta(z)$, along a cantilever beam subjected to an end torque $T_0$.\n\nFirst, we establish the governing relations from first principles. For a differential element of the beam of length $dz$, equilibrium requires that the total internal torque $T(z)$ is constant along the beam's length, as there is no distributed external torque. Thus, $T(z) = T_0$ for all $z \\in [0, L]$.\n\nAccording to Vlasov's theory, the total internal torque $T(z)$ is the sum of two components: the Saint-Venant torque, $T_{sv}(z)$, and the warping torque, $T_{\\omega}(z)$.\n$$T_0 = T_{sv}(z) + T_{\\omega}(z)$$\nThe Saint-Venant torque is proportional to the rate of twist:\n$$T_{sv}(z) = GJ \\frac{d\\theta}{dz}$$\nwhere $G$ is the shear modulus and $J$ is the Saint-Venant torsion constant.\n\nThe warping torque, $T_{\\omega}(z)$, arises from shear stresses that equilibrate the gradient of longitudinal stresses due to restrained warping. This torque is related to the gradient of the bimoment, $B(z)$. The constitutive relation for the bimoment, derived from the definition of warping displacement and longitudinal stress, is:\n$$B(z) = -EI_{\\omega} \\frac{d^2\\theta}{dz^2}$$\nwhere $E$ is Young's modulus and $I_{\\omega}$ is the warping constant. The negative sign is a standard convention.\n\nThe warping torque is given by the derivative of the bimoment, $T_{\\omega}(z) = \\frac{dB}{dz}$. This relation can be rigorously established through variational principles (calculus of variations on the potential energy functional) or by considering the equilibrium of warping-induced stresses on a differential element.\n$$T_{\\omega}(z) = \\frac{d}{dz} \\left(-EI_{\\omega} \\frac{d^2\\theta}{dz^2}\\right) = -EI_{\\omega} \\frac{d^3\\theta}{dz^3}$$\nSubstituting the expressions for $T_{sv}$ and $T_{\\omega}$ into the total torque equation gives the governing differential relation for the twist angle $\\theta(z)$:\n$$T_0 = GJ \\frac{d\\theta}{dz} - EI_{\\omega} \\frac{d^3\\theta}{dz^3}$$\nThis is a third-order, linear, non-homogeneous ordinary differential equation. It is more convenient to solve the equivalent fourth-order homogeneous equation, which is found by differentiating with respect to $z$:\n$$EI_{\\omega} \\frac{d^4\\theta}{dz^4} - GJ \\frac{d^2\\theta}{dz^2} = 0$$\nLet us define a characteristic parameter $k^2 = \\frac{GJ}{EI_{\\omega}}$. The equation becomes:\n$$\\frac{d^4\\theta}{dz^4} - k^2 \\frac{d^2\\theta}{dz^2} = 0$$\nThe characteristic equation is $r^4 - k^2 r^2 = 0$, which factors as $r^2(r^2 - k^2) = 0$. The roots are $r=0$ (with multiplicity $2$) and $r = \\pm k$. The general solution for $\\theta(z)$ is therefore:\n$$\\theta(z) = C_1 \\cosh(kz) + C_2 \\sinh(kz) + C_3 z + C_4$$\nWe must determine the four constants of integration ($C_1, C_2, C_3, C_4$) using the specified boundary conditions.\n\nThe derivatives of $\\theta(z)$ are:\n$$\\frac{d\\theta}{dz} = C_1 k \\sinh(kz) + C_2 k \\cosh(kz) + C_3$$\n$$\\frac{d^2\\theta}{dz^2} = C_1 k^2 \\cosh(kz) + C_2 k^2 \\sinh(kz)$$\n$$\\frac{d^3\\theta}{dz^3} = C_1 k^3 \\sinh(kz) + C_2 k^3 \\cosh(kz)$$\n\nThe boundary conditions are:\n1.  Clamped rotation at the fixed end ($z=0$): $\\theta(0) = 0$.\n2.  Clamped warping at the fixed end ($z=0$): The warping displacement is zero. Warping displacement is proportional to $\\frac{d\\theta}{dz}$, so we must have $\\frac{d\\theta}{dz}(0) = 0$.\n3.  Zero bimoment at the free end ($z=L$): $B(L) = 0$.

The expression for total torque is $T(z) = GJ\\frac{d\\theta}{dz} - EI_{\\omega}\\frac{d^3\\theta}{dz^3}$. Thus, $T(L) = T_0$. This condition will be used to determine one of the constants. Evaluating $T(z)$ with our general solution:\n$$T(z) = GJ(C_1 k \\sinh(kz) + C_2 k \\cosh(kz) + C_3) - EI_{\\omega}(C_1 k^3 \\sinh(kz) + C_2 k^3 \\cosh(kz))$$\nUsing $k^2=\\frac{GJ}{EI_{\\omega}}$, we have $EI_{\\omega}k^2 = GJ$.

The core of the question lies in the local behavior of the solution $w$ near the reentrant corner.\n\nAccording to the theory of elliptic partial differential equations in polygonal domains, the solution to the Laplace equation near a corner of interior angle $\\omega$ with homogeneous Neumann boundary conditions on the adjacent straight edges has an asymptotic expansion. In local polar coordinates $(r, \\theta)$ centered at the corner, the solution can be expressed as a series of singular functions. The leading singular term, which governs the local behavior, is of the form:\n$$ w(r, \\theta) \\sim C r^{\\lambda} \\cos(\\lambda \\theta) $$\nwhere the exponent $\\lambda$ is given by $\\lambda = \\pi/\\omega$. For a reentrant corner, we have $\\pi  \\omega  2\\pi$, which implies that $1/2  \\lambda  1$.\n\nThe gradient of the warping function, $\\nabla w$, which is directly related to the shear stresses, behaves as:\n$$ |\\nabla w| \\sim r^{\\lambda-1} $$\nSince $\\lambda  1$, the exponent $\\lambda-1$ is negative. This proves that the gradient of the warping function, and thus the shear stresses, are singular at the corner tip ($r=0$).\n\nThe finiteness of the torsional rigidity $J$ depends on the integrability of the strain energy density, which is proportional to $(\\gamma_{xz}^2 + \\gamma_{yz}^2)$. Near the corner, the dominant contribution is from $|\\nabla w|^2$. To check for integrability, we examine the integral in local polar coordinates:\n$$ \\int_{\\text{local disk}} |\\nabla w|^2 \\, \\mathrm{d}A \\sim \\int_0^{\\epsilon} (r^{\\lambda-1})^2 \\, r \\, \\mathrm{d}r = \\int_0^{\\epsilon} r^{2\\lambda - 1} \\, \\mathrm{d}r $$\nThis integral converges if and only if the exponent $2\\lambda - 1  -1$, which simplifies to $2\\lambda  0$, or $\\lambda  0$.

Therefore, $|\\nabla w|$ is square-integrable (i.e., $w \\in H^1(\\Omega)$), the total strain energy $U$ is finite, and the torsional rigidity $J$ is finite.\n\nNow we analyze the provided options.\n\n**A. In local polar coordinates $(r,\\theta)$ centered at the reentrant corner, the leading term of $w$ behaves like $w(r,\\theta) \\sim r^{\\lambda} f(\\theta)$ with $\\lambda = \\pi/\\omega \\in (0,1)$, so $|\\nabla w| \\sim r^{\\lambda-1}$ is singular but square-integrable. Consequently, $J$ is finite, yet on quasi-uniform meshes of size $h$ the FEM error in $J$ deteriorates to an algebraic rate governed by the corner exponent, with a representative scaling $|J_h - J| = \\mathcal{O}(h^{2\\lambda})$ for energy-based evaluations of $J$ using conforming approximations.**\n\nThe analysis above confirms that $w \\sim r^{\\lambda}f(\\theta)$ with $\\lambda = \\pi/\\omega$. Given $\\pi  \\omega  2\\pi$, we have $1/2  \\lambda  1$. The gradient $|\\nabla w| \\sim r^{\\lambda-1}$ is therefore singular. The verification that $|\\nabla w|$ is square-integrable and $J$ is finite is also correct. The regularity of the solution is $w \\in H^{1+\\lambda-\\epsilon}(\\Omega)$ for any arbitrarily small $\\epsilon  0$. For a conforming FEM using polynomial shape functions of degree $p$ on a quasi-uniform mesh sequence of size $h$, the error in the energy norm is limited by the solution's regularity, yielding $\\|w-w_h\\|_{H^1} = \\mathcal{O}(h^{\\min(p, \\lambda)})$. For linear elements ($p=1$) and since $\\lambda1$, this rate is $\\mathcal{O}(h^\\lambda)$. The error for an energy-based functional like $J$ is well known to be related to the square of the energy norm error, giving $|J_h - J| = \\mathcal{O}(h^{2\\lambda})$. All parts of this statement are consistent with established theory of FEM for singular problems.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. Because the corner singularity makes the shear-energy density non-integrable, $J$ is infinite unless the corner is rounded, and $p$-refinement without mesh grading eliminates the singularity and restores exponential convergence.**\n\nThe first claim is false. As demonstrated, the square of the stress singularity is integrable, meaning the shear-energy density is integrable and $J$ is finite. The second claim is also false. Numerical methods do not \"eliminate\" a singularity inherent to the exact solution of the PDE. Furthermore, $p$-refinement on a quasi-uniform mesh for a singular problem does not restore exponential convergence; it results in a suboptimal algebraic convergence rate controlled by the singularity exponent $\\lambda$. Exponential convergence requires specialized *hp*-refinement strategies, including geometric mesh grading.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. The reentrant-corner singularity cancels in the integral defining $J$, so even coarse quasi-uniform meshes recover $J$ with asymptotically exact accuracy; mesh grading near the corner is unnecessary and may destabilize the solution.**\n\nThis statement is fundamentally flawed. The singularity does not \"cancel\" in the integral; its presence makes the integrand difficult to approximate with polynomials, which is the basis of FEM. The consequence is that standard methods on quasi-uniform meshes exhibit poor convergence, as noted in option A. Far from being unnecessary, mesh grading towards the singularity is the standard and essential technique to improve accuracy and restore optimal convergence rates for singular problems. The claim of destabilization is baseless; properly implemented mesh grading enhances both stability and accuracy.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. Using simultaneous refinement of element size $h$ and keeping the polynomial degree $p$ fixed (with element sizes independent of $r$) yields exponential convergence for $J$ in the presence of the corner singularity, so geometric mesh grading toward the corner is not required.**\n\nThe procedure described, \"`simultaneous refinement of element size $h$ ... with element sizes independent of $r$\", is precisely a quasi-uniform $h$-refinement. As established in the analysis of option A, this strategy yields a slow algebraic convergence rate, specifically $\\mathcal{O}(h^{2\\lambda})$ for the functional $J$, not exponential convergence. Exponential convergence for solutions with singularities is only achievable with *hp*-refinement, where both $h$ and $p$ are refined in a coordinated manner, typically on a geometrically graded mesh. The claim that geometric grading is not required is false.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**E. For a conforming displacement-based FEM, evaluating $J$ from the minimized energy functional yields an upper bound $J_h \\ge J$. A complementary, statically admissible stress reconstruction can furnish a lower bound. Geometric mesh grading toward the corner with a mapping $r = \\xi^{q}$, where $\\xi \\in (0,1)$ and $q  1/\\lambda$, equidistributes the energy error in layers and accelerates the convergence (and tightening) of these bounds for $J$.**\n\nThe first part is a direct consequence of the Rayleigh-Ritz principle for conforming, displacement-based FEM. By minimizing the energy functional over a subspace of the true solution space, the resulting approximate energy is an upper bound on the true minimum energy. Since $J$ is proportional to this energy, $J_h \\ge J$. The second part correctly states the principle of dual analysis: a complementary formulation based on a statically admissible stress field provides a lower bound on the energy, and thus on $J$. The third part describes a standard and effective technique for handling corner singularities. A geometric mesh grading, defined by a mapping like $r = \\xi^q$, concentrates elements near the singularity. The condition on the grading factor, $q  1/\\lambda$ (more generally $q \\ge p/\\lambda$ for degree $p$ elements), is precisely the requirement to transform the singular function into a sufficiently regular one in the mapped coordinate $\\xi$, thereby restoring optimal algebraic convergence rates for $h$-refinement or enabling exponential convergence for *hp*-refinement. This strategy does indeed equidistribute the error and dramatically accelerate convergence.\n**Verdict: Correct.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{AE}$$", "id": "2929423"}]}
