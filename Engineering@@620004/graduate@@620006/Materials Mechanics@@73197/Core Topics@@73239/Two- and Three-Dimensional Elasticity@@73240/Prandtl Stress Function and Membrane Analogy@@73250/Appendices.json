The problem is well-posed, scientifically grounded, and internally consistent. It is therefore deemed valid and a solution will be provided.\n\nLet the equilateral triangular cross-section be denoted by the domain $A$. The side length is $s$. We choose a Cartesian coordinate system $(x,y)$ with its origin at the centroid of the triangle and the $y$-axis aligned with one of the altitudes. This choice simplifies the calculations by exploiting the symmetry of the cross-section.\n\nIn this coordinate system, the vertices of the triangle are located at $(0, 2c)$, $(\\sqrt{3}c, -c)$, and $(-\\sqrt{3}c, -c)$, where $c$ is the apothem (inradius) of the triangle. The apothem $c$ and the height $h = 3c$ are related to the side length $s$ by $s = 2\\sqrt{3}c$. Thus, $c = \\frac{s}{2\\sqrt{3}}$. The height of the triangle is $h = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}s = 3c$, so the top vertex is at $(0, \\frac{2}{3}h)$ and the base is at $y = -\\frac{1}{3}h$, which confirms the centroid is at the origin.\n\nThe three lines forming the boundary of the triangle are:\n1.  The base: $y = -c$. The equation of the line is $L_1(x,y) \\equiv y+c=0$.\n2.  The right side, passing through $(\\sqrt{3}c, -c)$ and $(0, 2c)$: The slope is $\\frac{2c - (-c)}{0 - \\sqrt{3}c} = \\frac{3c}{-\\sqrt{3}c} = -\\sqrt{3}$. The equation is $y - 2c = -\\sqrt{3}x$, which gives $L_2(x,y) \\equiv \\sqrt{3}x+y-2c=0$.\n3.  The left side, passing through $(-\\sqrt{3}c, -c)$ and $(0, 2c)$: The slope is $\\sqrt{3}$. The equation is $y - 2c = \\sqrt{3}x$, which gives $L_3(x,y) \\equiv -\\sqrt{3}x+y-2c=0$.\n\nFor a point $(x,y)$ in the interior of the triangle (e.g., the origin $(0,0)$), we find $y+c>0$, $\\sqrt{3}x+y-2c<0$, and $-\\sqrt{3}x+y-2c<0$. To satisfy the condition that the linear functions $l_i(x,y)$ are positive inside the triangle, we define them as:\n$l_1(x,y) = y+c$\n$l_2(x,y) = -(\\sqrt{3}x+y-2c) = 2c-y-\\sqrt{3}x$\n$l_3(x,y) = -(-\\sqrt{3}x+y-2c) = 2c-y+\\sqrt{3}x$\n\n**1. Proposing the Ansatz for the Stress Function $\\phi(x,y)$**\n\nThe Prandtl stress function $\\phi$ must satisfy the boundary condition $\\phi=0$ on all three sides of the triangle. The lowest-degree polynomial that satisfies this condition for the entire boundary is the product of the linear functions defining the sides. This form also inherently possesses the $120^\\circ$ rotational symmetry of the equilateral triangle. We thus propose the ansatz:\n$$ \\phi(x,y) = C \\cdot l_1(x,y) \\cdot l_2(x,y) \\cdot l_3(x,y) $$\nwhere $C$ is a constant to be determined.\nSubstituting the expressions for $l_i(x,y)$:\n$$ \\phi(x,y) = C(y+c)(2c-y-\\sqrt{3}x)(2c-y+\\sqrt{3}x) $$\nThe product of the last two terms is $(2c-y)^2 - (\\sqrt{3}x)^2 = (4c^2 - 4cy + y^2) - 3x^2$.\n$$ \\phi(x,y) = C(y+c)(4c^2 - 4cy + y^2 - 3x^2) $$\nExpanding this expression gives:\n$$ \\phi(x,y) = C(4c^2y - 4cy^2 + y^3 - 3x^2y + 4c^3 - 4c^2y + cy^2 - 3cx^2) $$\n$$ \\phi(x,y) = C(y^3 - 3cy^2 - 3x^2y - 3cx^2 + 4c^3) $$\nThis can be written more compactly as:\n$$ \\phi(x,y) = C \\left[ y(y^2-3x^2) - 3c(x^2+y^2) + 4c^3 \\right] $$\nThis is our proposed third-degree polynomial ansatz for the stress function.\n\n**2. Determining the Constant from the Governing Equation**\n\nThe governing Poisson equation is $\\nabla^2 \\phi = -2G\\theta$. We compute the Laplacian of our ansatz.\nFirst, we find the partial derivatives with respect to $x$ and $y$:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial \\phi}{\\partial x} = C(-6xy - 6cx) = -6C(xy+cx) $$\n$$ \\frac{\\partial^2 \\phi}{\\partial x^2} = -6C(y+c) $$\n$$ \\frac{\\partial \\phi}{\\partial y} = C(3y^2 - 6cy - 3x^2) $$\n$$ \\frac{\\partial^2 \\phi}{\\partial y^2} = C(6y - 6c) = 6C(y-c) $$\nThe Laplacian is the sum of the second partial derivatives:\n$$ \\nabla^2 \\phi = \\frac{\\partial^2 \\phi}{\\partial x^2} + \\frac{\\partial^2 \\phi}{\\partial y^2} = -6C(y+c) + 6C(y-c) = -6Cy - 6Cc + 6Cy - 6Cc = -12Cc $$\nSubstituting this into the governing equation:\n$$ -12Cc = -2G\\theta $$\nSolving for the constant $C$:\n$$ C = \\frac{2G\\theta}{12c} = \\frac{G\\theta}{6c} $$\nThe stress function is therefore fully determined:\n$$ \\phi(x,y) = \\frac{G\\theta}{6c} \\left[ y(y^2-3x^2) - 3c(x^2+y^2) + 4c^3 \\right] $$\n\n**3. Deriving the Torsion Constant $J_t$**\n\nThe total torque $T$ is defined in the problem as $T = \\iint_A (x \\tau_{yz} - y \\tau_{xz}) dA$. We can relate this to an integral over the stress function $\\phi$. Using the definitions $\\tau_{yz} = -\\frac{\\partial \\phi}{\\partial x}$ and $\\tau_{xz} = \\frac{\\partial \\phi}{\\partial y}$:\n$$ T = \\iint_A \\left(x\\left(-\\frac{\\partial \\phi}{\\partial x}\\right) - y\\left(\\frac{\\partial \\phi}{\\partial y}\\right)\\right) dA = - \\iint_A \\left(x\\frac{\\partial \\phi}{\\partial x} + y\\frac{\\partial \\phi}{\\partial y}\\right) dA $$\nWe use integration by parts (Green's first identity). For example, for the first term:\n$$ \\iint_A x\\frac{\\partial \\phi}{\\partial x} dA = \\oint_{\\partial A} x\\phi n_x dS - \\iint_A \\phi \\frac{\\partial x}{\\partial x} dA = \\oint_{\\partial A} x\\phi n_x dS - \\iint_A \\phi dA $$\nwhere $\\partial A$ is the boundary of the domain $A$, and $n_x$ is the x-component of the outward unit normal. Since $\\phi = 0$ on the boundary $\\partial A$, the line integral vanishes. Thus, $\\iint_A x\\frac{\\partial \\phi}{\\partial x} dA = -\\iint_A \\phi dA$. Similarly, $\\iint_A y\\frac{\\partial \\phi}{\\partial y} dA = -\\iint_A \\phi dA$.\nSubstituting these into the expression for torque:\n$$ T = -(-\\iint_A \\phi dA - \\iint_A \\phi dA) = 2 \\iint_A \\phi dA $$\nNow we must evaluate this integral.\n$$ T = 2C \\iint_A \\left( y^3 - 3cy^2 - 3x^2y - 3cx^2 + 4c^3 \\right) dA $$\nWe can split this into several integrals over the domain $A$:\n$$ T = 2C \\left[ \\iint_A y^3 dA - 3\\iint_A x^2y dA - 3c\\iint_A(x^2+y^2)dA + 4c^3 \\iint_A dA \\right] $$\nDue to the $120^\\circ$ rotational symmetry of the equilateral triangle and the choice of the centroid as the origin, it can be shown that $\\iint_A y^3 dA = - \\iint_A x^2y dA$. Let $K = \\iint_A y^3 dA$. The integral over the first two terms is $\\iint_A (y^3 - 3x^2y) dA = K - 3(-K) = 4K$.\nThe integrals are standard geometric properties:\n- $\\iint_A (x^2+y^2)dA = I_p$, the polar moment of inertia of the area about the centroid. For an equilateral triangle of side $s$, $I_p = \\frac{s^4}{16\\sqrt{3}}$. In terms of $c = \\frac{s}{2\\sqrt{3}}$, this is $I_p = 3\\sqrt{3}c^4$.\n- $\\iint_A dA = \\text{Area}$. For an equilateral triangle of side $s$, Area $= \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{4}s^2$. In terms of $c$, Area $= 3\\sqrt{3}c^2$.\n- The integral $K = \\iint_A y^3 dA$ must be evaluated directly:\n$$ K = \\int_{-c}^{2c} y^3 \\left( \\int_{-\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}}(2c-y)}^{\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}}(2c-y)} dx \\right) dy = \\int_{-c}^{2c} y^3 \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{3}}(2c-y) dy = \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{3}} \\int_{-c}^{2c} (2cy^3 - y^4) dy $$\n$$ K = \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{3}} \\left[ \\frac{2c}{4}y^4 - \\frac{y^5}{5} \\right]_{-c}^{2c} = \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{3}} \\left[ \\left(\\frac{c}{2}(16c^4) - \\frac{32c^5}{5}\\right) - \\left(\\frac{c}{2}(c^4) - \\frac{-c^5}{5}\\right) \\right] $$\n$$ K = \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{3}} \\left[ \\left(8c^5 - \\frac{32c^5}{5}\\right) - \\left(\\frac{c^5}{2} + \\frac{c^5}{5}\\right) \\right] = \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{3}} \\left[ \\frac{8c^5}{5} - \\frac{7c^5}{10} \\right] = \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{3}} \\left( \\frac{9c^5}{10} \\right) = \\frac{9\\sqrt{3}}{15}c^5 = \\frac{3\\sqrt{3}}{5}c^5 $$\nNow we assemble the terms for the torque integral:\n$$ \\iint_A \\phi dA = C \\left[ 4K - 3cI_p + 4c^3 \\text{Area} \\right] $$\n$$ \\iint_A \\phi dA = C \\left[ 4\\left(\\frac{3\\sqrt{3}}{5}c^5\\right) - 3c(3\\sqrt{3}c^4) + 4c^3(3\\sqrt{3}c^2) \\right] $$\n$$ \\iint_A \\phi dA = C \\left[ \\frac{12\\sqrt{3}}{5}c^5 - 9\\sqrt{3}c^5 + 12\\sqrt{3}c^5 \\right] = C \\left[ \\frac{12\\sqrt{3}}{5}c^5 + 3\\sqrt{3}c^5 \\right] = C \\frac{27\\sqrt{3}}{5}c^5 $$\nThe torque is $T = 2\\iint_A \\phi dA = 2C \\frac{27\\sqrt{3}}{5}c^5$.\nSubstitute $C = \\frac{G\\theta}{6c}$:\n$$ T = 2\\left(\\frac{G\\theta}{6c}\\right) \\frac{27\\sqrt{3}}{5}c^5 = \\frac{G\\theta}{3c} \\frac{27\\sqrt{3}}{5}c^5 = \\frac{9\\sqrt{3}}{5}G\\theta c^4 $$\nFrom the definition $T = GJ_t\\theta$, we identify the torsion constant $J_t$:\n$$ J_t = \\frac{9\\sqrt{3}}{5}c^4 $$\nFinally, we express $J_t$ in terms of the side length $s$, using $c = \\frac{s}{2\\sqrt{3}}$:\n$$ J_t = \\frac{9\\sqrt{3}}{5} \\left( \\frac{s}{2\\sqrt{3}} \\right)^4 = \\frac{9\\sqrt{3}}{5} \\frac{s^4}{16 \\cdot (\\sqrt{3})^4} = \\frac{9\\sqrt{3}}{5} \\frac{s^4}{16 \\cdot 9} = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{80}s^4 $$\nThis is the exact expression for the torsion constant of an equilateral triangular cross-section.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{80}s^{4}}$$", "id": "2910859"}, {"introduction": "While polynomial ansatzes are effective for specific geometries, spectral methods offer a more systematic approach for solving Partial Differential Equations on regular domains.

For Saint-Venant torsion, the stress tensor has only two non-zero components, $\\tau_{xz}$ and $\\tau_{yz}$, which are assumed to be independent of the axial coordinate $z$. In the absence of body forces, the equilibrium equations $\\nabla \\cdot \\boldsymbol{\\sigma} = \\mathbf{0}$ reduce to a single non-trivial equation:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial \\tau_{xz}}{\\partial x} + \\frac{\\partial \\tau_{yz}}{\\partial y} = 0\n$$\nSubstituting the definitions $\\tau_{xz} = \\frac{\\partial \\phi}{\\partial y}$ and $\\tau_{yz} = -\\frac{\\partial \\phi}{\\partial x}$, we find\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}\\left(\\frac{\\partial \\phi}{\\partial y}\\right) + \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}\\left(-\\frac{\\partial \\phi}{\\partial x}\\right) = \\frac{\\partial^2 \\phi}{\\partial x \\partial y} - \\frac{\\partial^2 \\phi}{\\partial y \\partial x} = 0\n$$\nThis demonstrates that the stress function formulation identically satisfies the equilibrium condition.\n\nNext, we invoke the compatibility condition. For pure torsion, the strain components are related by $\\frac{\\partial \\gamma_{yz}}{\\partial x} - \\frac{\\partial \\gamma_{xz}}{\\partial y} = 2\\theta'$. For a linear elastic isotropic material with shear modulus $G$, Hooke's law gives $\\tau_{xz} = G\\gamma_{xz}$ and $\\tau_{yz} = G\\gamma_{yz}$. Substituting these into the compatibility equation yields:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}\\left(\\frac{\\tau_{yz}}{G}\\right) - \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}\\left(\\frac{\\tau_{xz}}{G}\\right) = 2\\theta'\n$$\nSubstituting the stress function definitions:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{G} \\left[ \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}\\left(-\\frac{\\partial \\phi}{\\partial x}\\right) - \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}\\left(\\frac{\\partial \\phi}{\\partial y}\\right) \\right] = 2\\theta'\n$$\n$$\n-\\frac{1}{G} \\left( \\frac{\\partial^2 \\phi}{\\partial x^2} + \\frac{\\partial^2 \\phi}{\\partial y^2} \\right) = 2\\theta'\n$$\nThis gives the governing Poisson equation for the stress function:\n$$\n\\nabla^2 \\phi(x,y) = -2G\\theta'\n$$\nThe problem is defined over the rectangular domain $\\Omega = \\{(x,y) : 0 < x < a, 0 < y < b\\}$ with the homogeneous Dirichlet boundary condition $\\phi = 0$ on the boundary $\\partial \\Omega$.\n\nWe solve this boundary-value problem using a spectral method.

The provided information is scientifically sound, self-contained, and sufficient for a rigorous analysis. The problem is valid.
