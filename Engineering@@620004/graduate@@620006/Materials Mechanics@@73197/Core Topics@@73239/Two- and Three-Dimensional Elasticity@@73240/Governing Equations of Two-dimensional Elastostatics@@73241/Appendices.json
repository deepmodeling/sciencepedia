It is a well-posed, scientifically grounded exercise in the classical theory of linear elasticity. I will proceed to the solution.\n\nThe fundamental premise of this problem is geometric compatibility. For a given strain field $\\varepsilon_{ij}$ to be derivable from a single-valued, continuous displacement field $u_i(x,y)$, the strain components cannot be chosen arbitrarily. They must satisfy certain differential constraints known as the Saint-Venant compatibility conditions. The existence of such a displacement field is guaranteed in a simply connected domain if and only if these conditions are met.\n\nWe begin with the definitions of the infinitesimal strain components in two dimensions, given a displacement field with components $u_x(x,y)$ and $u_y(x,y)$:\n$$ \\varepsilon_{xx} = \\frac{\\partial u_x}{\\partial x} \\quad (1) $$\n$$ \\varepsilon_{yy} = \\frac{\\partial u_y}{\\partial y} \\quad (2) $$\n$$ 2\\varepsilon_{xy} = \\frac{\\partial u_x}{\\partial y} + \\frac{\\partial u_y}{\\partial x} \\quad (3) $$\nHere, we use the engineering definition of shear strain, $\\gamma_{xy} = 2\\varepsilon_{xy}$.\n\nTo derive the compatibility condition, we must eliminate the displacement components $u_x$ and $u_y$ from these three equations. This is achieved by differentiation. We assume that the displacement field is sufficiently smooth (of class $C^3$ or higher), which ensures the equality of mixed partial derivatives (Clairaut's theorem).\n\nDifferentiate equation $(1)$ twice with respect to $y$:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial^2 \\varepsilon_{xx}}{\\partial y^2} = \\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial y^2} \\left( \\frac{\\partial u_x}{\\partial x} \\right) = \\frac{\\partial^3 u_x}{\\partial y^2 \\partial x} $$\n\nDifferentiate equation $(2)$ twice with respect to $x$:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial^2 \\varepsilon_{yy}}{\\partial x^2} = \\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial x^2} \\left( \\frac{\\partial u_y}{\\partial y} \\right) = \\frac{\\partial^3 u_y}{\\partial x^2 \\partial y} $$\n\nNow, differentiate equation $(3)$ with respect to $x$ and then with respect to $y$:\n$$ 2\\frac{\\partial^2 \\varepsilon_{xy}}{\\partial x \\partial y} = \\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial x \\partial y} \\left( \\frac{\\partial u_x}{\\partial y} + \\frac{\\partial u_y}{\\partial x} \\right) = \\frac{\\partial^3 u_x}{\\partial x \\partial y^2} + \\frac{\\partial^3 u_y}{\\partial y \\partial x^2} $$\n\nDue to the assumed smoothness of the displacement field, the order of differentiation is immaterial. Thus, we can write:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial^3 u_x}{\\partial y^2 \\partial x} = \\frac{\\partial^3 u_x}{\\partial x \\partial y^2} $$\n$$ \\frac{\\partial^3 u_y}{\\partial x^2 \\partial y} = \\frac{\\partial^3 u_y}{\\partial y \\partial x^2} $$\nBy substituting the expressions for the third derivatives of the displacements, we combine the results:\n$$ 2\\frac{\\partial^2 \\varepsilon_{xy}}{\\partial x \\partial y} = \\frac{\\partial^2 \\varepsilon_{xx}}{\\partial y^2} + \\frac{\\partial^2 \\varepsilon_{yy}}{\\partial x^2} $$\nThis is the single scalar Saint-Venant compatibility condition for a two-dimensional strain field. It is a necessary condition for the existence of a corresponding displacement field.

Since this is satisfied for all values of $A$ and $B$, this strain field is always compatible in a simply connected domain. Therefore, there are no restrictive conditions on the constants $A$ and $B$ for the existence of a corresponding displacement field.
