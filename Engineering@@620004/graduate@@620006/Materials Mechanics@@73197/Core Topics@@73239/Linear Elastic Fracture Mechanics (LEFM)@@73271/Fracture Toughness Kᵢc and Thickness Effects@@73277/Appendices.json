This exercise challenges you to derive the widely used thickness criterion from first principles, starting with Irwin’s estimate of the crack-tip plastic zone size. By connecting the abstract concept of stress state to a concrete geometric requirement, you will gain a deeper insight into how constraint governs fracture behavior and validates a $K_{Ic}$ test. [@problem_id:2890327]", "problem": "A laboratory wishes to measure the Mode I plane-strain fracture toughness $K_{Ic}$ of a high-strength ferritic steel using a compact-tension specimen of thickness $B$. The steel has yield strength $\\sigma_{Y}$ and exhibits predominantly linear elastic behavior up to yielding. The measured $K$-value will be a valid material $K_{Ic}$ only if a plane-strain, small-scale yielding state exists at the crack tip over a substantial fraction of the thickness.\n\nStarting from the linear elastic near-tip stress field for a Mode I crack and Irwin’s plastic-zone estimate, argue how a thickness requirement of the form $B \\ge C\\left(K_{Ic}/\\sigma_{Y}\\right)^{2}$ emerges, and justify the order of magnitude of the dimensionless coefficient $C$ by appealing to the need to suppress free-surface plane-stress zones and to preserve a triaxial, plane-strain core at the mid-plane.

It is a standard problem in the field of linear elastic fracture mechanics and is therefore valid for solution.\n\nThe problem requires a derivation of the specimen thickness requirement for valid plane-strain fracture toughness testing, an explanation of its connection to fundamental energy principles, and a final calculation.\n\nFirst, we will establish the basis for the thickness requirement. The stress field near the tip of a Mode I crack in a linear elastic material is characterized by the stress intensity factor, $K_I$. Along the plane ahead of the crack ($\\theta=0$), the stress component normal to the crack plane, $\\sigma_{yy}$, is given by:\n$$\n\\sigma_{yy}(r, \\theta=0) = \\frac{K_I}{\\sqrt{2\\pi r}}\n$$\nwhere $r$ is the distance from the crack tip. This equation predicts an unphysical stress singularity at $r=0$. In a real material with a finite yield strength, $\\sigma_Y$, yielding occurs when the local stress reaches this value. A small region of plasticity, known as the plastic zone, forms at the crack tip. A first-order estimate for the size of this plastic zone, $r_p$, can be obtained by finding the distance $r$ at which $\\sigma_{yy}$ equals $\\sigma_Y$:\n$$\n\\sigma_Y = \\frac{K_I}{\\sqrt{2\\pi r_p}} \\implies r_p = \\frac{1}{2\\pi} \\left(\\frac{K_I}{\\sigma_Y}\\right)^2\n$$\nThis is a simplified estimate. Irwin's model, accounting for the stress redistribution caused by yielding, provides a more accurate estimate for the plastic zone size. The size depends critically on the state of stress: plane stress or plane strain.\n\nAt the free surfaces of a specimen of thickness $B$, the stress component normal to the surface, $\\sigma_{zz}$, must be zero, leading to a state of plane stress. In the interior of the specimen, if it is sufficiently thick, the material is constrained in the thickness direction, leading to $\\epsilon_{zz} \\approx 0$, which defines a state of plane strain. The plane-strain condition creates a triaxial stress state that inhibits plastic flow, resulting in a smaller plastic zone compared to the plane-stress condition. The approximate plastic zone sizes, $r_p$, are:\n$$\nr_p^{\\text{plane stress}} \\approx \\frac{1}{\\pi} \\left(\\frac{K_I}{\\sigma_Y}\\right)^2\n$$\n$$\nr_p^{\\text{plane strain}} \\approx \\frac{1}{3\\pi} \\left(\\frac{K_I}{\\sigma_Y}\\right)^2\n$$\nFor a toughness measurement to be a valid plane-strain fracture toughness, $K_{Ic}$, the crack tip must be predominantly under plane-strain conditions. This means the specimen thickness, $B$, must be substantially larger than the extent of the plane-stress plastic zones that develop at the free surfaces. The governing dimension is the size of the larger, plane-stress plastic zone. The requirement is that the thickness $B$ must be much greater than the plastic zone diameter, which is $2r_p$. A conservative condition is thus set for $B$ relative to $r_p^{\\text{plane stress}}$:\n$$\nB \\gg r_p^{\\text{plane stress}}\n$$\nLet us express this as a formal requirement: $B \\ge C_0 \\cdot r_p^{\\text{plane stress}}$, where $C_0$ is a dimensionless factor substantially greater than one. Substituting the expression for the plane-stress plastic zone size and using $K_I = K_{Ic}$ at fracture:\n$$\nB \\ge C_0 \\frac{1}{\\pi} \\left(\\frac{K_{Ic}}{\\sigma_Y}\\right)^2\n$$\nCombining the constants $C_0$ and $\\pi$ into a single coefficient $C = C_0 / \\pi$, we arrive at the required form:\n$$\nB \\ge C \\left(\\frac{K_{Ic}}{\\sigma_Y}\\right)^2\n$$\nThe value of the coefficient $C$ is determined empirically to ensure that the measured toughness value is independent of specimen thickness, which is the defining characteristic of a true material property. To justify its order of magnitude, consider that to achieve a dominant plane-strain core, the thickness $B$ should be many times the plastic zone size. If we mandate, for instance, that $B$ be approximately $8$ times the plastic zone radius, $r_p^{\\text{plane stress}}$, then $C_0 \\approx 8$. This leads to $C = 8/\\pi \\approx 2.55$. Experimental validation, as codified in standards such as ASTM E399, has established the value $C=2.5$. This value ensures that the size of the central plane-strain region is large enough that the surface plane-stress effects are negligible, and a state of high triaxiality is maintained.\n\nNext, we connect this to the Griffith energy criterion. The Griffith criterion, for a perfectly brittle material, posits that crack extension occurs when the energy release rate, $G$, equals the critical energy required to create new surfaces, $G_c = 2\\gamma_s$. Irwin extended this to ductile materials by showing that $G$ is related to the stress intensity factor $K$. For Mode I loading, the relations are:\n$$\nG_I = \\frac{K_I^2}{E} \\quad (\\text{plane stress})\n$$\n$$\nG_I = \\frac{K_I^2(1-\\nu^2)}{E} \\quad (\\text{plane strain})\n$$\nwhere $E$ is Young's modulus and $\\nu$ is Poisson's ratio. At fracture initiation, $K_I = K_c$ and $G_I = G_c$. The value of $G_c$, and therefore $K_c$, depends on the stress state. Plane strain provides greater constraint against plastic deformation, resulting in a lower energy dissipation and thus a lower toughness value. This minimum, thickness-independent toughness is denoted $K_{Ic}$, the plane-strain fracture toughness. The thickness requirement $B \\ge C(K_{Ic}/\\sigma_Y)^2$ is therefore a geometric constraint that forces the mechanical state at the crack tip into the plane-strain regime. By doing so, it ensures that the measured stress intensity factor at fracture corresponds to the true, minimum critical energy release rate, $G_{Ic} = K_{Ic}^2(1-\\nu^2)/E$, which is a fundamental material property.\n\nFinally, we compute the minimum required thickness, $B_{\\min}$, for the given steel.

Thus, the specimen thickness is sufficient for the measurement to be considered a valid plane-strain fracture toughness, $K_{Ic}$, based on this criterion.\n\nFinally, the role of thickness $B$ must be clarified. It enters the analysis in two distinct ways.\n1. In the calculation of the stress intensity factor $K_I$, the thickness $B$ appears in the denominator, $K_I \\propto P/B$. This reflects the fact that $K_I$ is a measure of the intensity of the elastic stress field, which scales with the applied load per unit thickness of the crack front. The dimensionless geometry function $f(a/W)$ is derived from a two-dimensional elasticity solution (plane stress or plane strain), and is thus independent of the out-of-plane dimension, $B$.\n2. In the validation of plane-strain conditions, $B$ plays a critical physical role. A state of plane strain, where strain through the thickness is negligible ($\\epsilon_{zz} \\approx 0$), is achieved only when the thickness is large enough to constrain plastic deformation at the crack tip. The criterion $B \\ge 2.5(K_Q/\\sigma_y)^2$ ensures that the plastic zone size is small relative to the thickness, thereby creating the triaxial stress state characteristic of plane strain. If the thickness were insufficient, a state of plane stress would prevail, leading to larger-scale plasticity and an artificially high, and thus invalid, measurement of fracture toughness.\n\nIn summary, the thickness acts as a simple normalization factor in the $K_I$ formula but is a fundamental physical parameter that governs the stress state at the crack tip and determines the validity of a $K_{Ic}$ measurement.\n\nThe calculated value of $K_I$, rounded to $4$ significant figures, is $13.82 \\ \\mathrm{MPa}\\sqrt{\\mathrm{m}}$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{13.82}\n$$", "id": "2887956"}, {"introduction": "Our analysis so far has relied on a simplified, binary view of the crack tip being either in plane stress or plane strain.

The plate is loaded in remote uniform tension that produces nominal Mode $I$ crack-tip conditions.

It is a standard, well-posed problem in fracture mechanics. A solution will now be derived.\n\n### Derivation and Analysis\n\nThe problem requires an understanding of how the state of stress varies through the thickness of a plate at a crack tip and how this variation affects plastic deformation and tearing resistance.\n\n**Fundamental Principles:**\n\n1.  **Stress State Variation:** At the free surfaces of the plate (at $z = \\pm B/2$), the stress component normal to the surface, $\\sigma_{zz}$, must be zero. This condition relaxes the out-of-plane constraint, leading to a local stress state that approaches **plane stress**. In the interior of a sufficiently thick plate (near $z=0$), the material is constrained from deforming in the thickness direction ($z$) by the surrounding material. This leads to $\\epsilon_{zz} \\approx 0$, a condition known as **plane strain**.\n\n2.  **Constraint and Triaxiality:** Plane strain conditions induce a significant tensile stress $\\sigma_{zz}$ ($\\sigma_{zz} \\approx \\nu(\\sigma_{xx} + \\sigma_{yy})$ in the elastic case), leading to high hydrostatic stress (also termed stress triaxiality). Plane stress conditions have $\\sigma_{zz}=0$, resulting in lower triaxiality. Thus, triaxiality is highest at the mid-thickness and lowest at the free surfaces.\n\n3.  **Plastic Zone Size:** The size of the crack-tip plastic zone, $r_p$, is dependent on the stress state. For a given applied stress intensity factor $K$, the plastic zone is significantly larger under plane stress conditions than under plane strain conditions. A common estimate shows $r_p \\propto (K/\\sigma_y)^2$, with the proportionality constant being larger for plane stress.\n\n4.  **Tearing Resistance and Constraint:** The problem explicitly states that lower triaxiality requires a larger energy release rate $J$ to cause tearing. Therefore, the local tearing resistance, which can be denoted as $J_R(z)$, is a function of the position $z$ along the crack front. Based on Principle 2, triaxiality is lowest at the surfaces ($z=\\pm B/2$) and highest at the center ($z=0$). This implies that the tearing resistance is highest at the surfaces and lowest at the center: $J_{R, \\text{surface}} > J_{R, \\text{interior}}$.\n\n5.  **Crack Growth Criterion:** Stable tearing occurs when the applied driving force, characterized by the $J$-integral, equals the material's tearing resistance, $J_R$. $J_{\\text{applied}} = J_R$.\n\nWith these principles, each option is evaluated.\n\n**Option-by-option Analysis:**\n\n**A. Near the free surfaces, the local state approaches plane stress, which lowers crack-tip triaxiality relative to the interior. For the same applied $K$, this increases the local plastic zone size and plastic dissipation per unit crack advance near the free surfaces compared to mid-thickness.**\n\n- The statement that the free surfaces ($z=\\pm B/2$) approach plane stress, leading to a lower triaxiality than the plane-strain-like interior, is a correct and fundamental concept in 3D fracture mechanics (Principles 1 and 2).\n- The statement that for the same applied $K$, the local plastic zone size is larger near the free surfaces (plane stress) than at mid-thickness (plane strain) is also correct (Principle 3). A larger plastic zone involves a larger volume of material undergoing plastic deformation.\n- The energy dissipated during crack advance is consumed primarily by this plastic deformation. A larger plastic zone therefore corresponds to greater plastic work and thus higher energy dissipation per unit of crack extension.\n- This statement is entirely consistent with the underlying physics.\n- **Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. For a ductile material with a rising crack-growth resistance curve, the local critical $J$ (or apparent crack-driving requirement) to initiate and sustain tearing is lower near the free surfaces than at mid-thickness.**\n\n- This statement claims that the tearing resistance is lower at the free surfaces.\n- As established in our analysis (Principle 4), the free surfaces are regions of low triaxiality (plane stress).\n- The problem explicitly states: \"regions of lower triaxiality require larger energy release rate $J$ to initiate and sustain tearing.\"\n- Therefore, the local critical $J$ must be *higher* near the free surfaces, not lower. This statement directly contradicts the premise given in the problem.\n- **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. Under a nominally uniform far-field load, the crack front will tend to advance preferentially at mid-thickness, producing a front that is bowed forward in the interior and recessed near the free surfaces (often called “tunneling”).**\n\n- A uniform far-field load results in a nominally uniform applied driving force, $J_{\\text{applied}}$, along the initially straight crack front.\n- The material's resistance to tearing, $J_R(z)$, is not uniform. As established from the problem's premise, $J_R$ is lowest at the mid-thickness (high constraint) and highest at the free surfaces (low constraint).\n- According to the crack growth criterion ($J_{\\text{applied}} = J_R$), as the load increases, $J_{\\text{applied}}$ will first reach the value of $J_R$ in the region where $J_R$ is lowest, which is the plate interior ($z=0$).\n- Consequently, the crack will start to grow at the mid-thickness while its growth is resisted at the surfaces. This differential growth causes the crack front to \"tunnel\" forward in the center, leading to a curved or bowed crack front.\n- **Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**D. Tunneling is negligible when $B$ is so small that the entire thickness is effectively under plane stress; as $B$ increases so that a significant interior region attains plane strain constraint, the severity of tunneling generally increases.**\n\n- If the thickness $B$ is very small (e.g., comparable to the plastic zone size), the $\\sigma_{zz}=0$ condition at the free surfaces influences the entire thickness, and a state of generalized plane stress prevails across the entire front. In this case, the constraint and tearing resistance $J_R$ are nearly uniform along the front. With uniform resistance and a uniform applied driving force, the crack grows uniformly, and tunneling is minimal.\n- As the thickness $B$ increases, a core region develops that is sufficiently far from the free surfaces to experience the high constraint of plane strain. This creates a significant gradient in constraint (and thus in $J_R$) between the center and the surfaces. A larger difference in $J_R$ between the interior and the surface will result in more pronounced preferential growth in the center, hence more severe tunneling.\n- This statement accurately describes the effect of thickness on the tunneling phenomenon.\n- **Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**E. Because the applied $K$ is nominally uniform along the crack front in a wide plate, the front remains straight during growth; tunneling requires nonuniform remote loading or residual stresses to develop.**\n\n- This statement incorrectly assumes that a uniform driving force ($K$ or $J_{\\text{applied}}$) is sufficient to ensure uniform crack growth.\n- It completely ignores the role of the material's local *resistance* to fracture. Crack growth is determined by the interplay between the driving force and the resistance.\n- As analyzed for option C, tunneling is a direct consequence of the *non-uniformity of fracture resistance* ($J_R(z)$) along the crack front, which arises from the through-thickness variation in constraint.\n- Tunneling can and does occur under uniform remote loading in a homogeneous material, precisely because of these 3D constraint effects.\n- **Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{ACD}$$", "id": "2887928"}]}
