It is a standard problem in linear elastic fracture mechanics (LEFM), based on the established theory of near-tip stress fields around a crack. The governing principles (linear elasticity, Airy stress function, Williams expansion, stress intensity factors) are fundamental to the field of solid mechanics. The provided data are complete, consistent, and physically realistic. There are no logical contradictions, ambiguities, or violations of scientific principles.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. A rigorous solution will be developed.\n\nThe foundation for this problem lies in two-dimensional linear elasticity. For a body with no body forces, the equilibrium equations are satisfied if the stress components are derived from an Airy stress function, $\\Phi$, which must satisfy the biharmonic equation, $\\nabla^4 \\Phi = 0$. For a crack geometry, solutions are sought in the form of a Williams eigenfunction expansion. The problem statement correctly presupposes that the dominant terms, which govern the stress singularity at the crack tip, are proportional to $r^{-1/2}$, where $r$ is the radial distance from the tip. This corresponds to the lowest valid eigenvalue $\\lambda=1/2$ in the expansion, where the stresses scale as $r^{\\lambda-1}$.\n\nThe resulting near-tip stress fields for Mode I and Mode II loading in a linear elastic material are well-established. By the principle of superposition, the total stress field for a mixed-mode loading is the sum of the individual mode contributions. The Cartesian stress component $\\sigma_{xx}$ is given by the sum of the Mode I and Mode II components:\n$$ \\sigma_{xx} = \\sigma_{xx}^{(I)} + \\sigma_{xx}^{(II)} $$\nThe expressions for these components as a function of the polar coordinates $(r, \\theta)$ are:\n$$ \\sigma_{xx}^{(I)} = \\frac{K_I}{\\sqrt{2\\pi r}} \\cos\\left(\\frac{\\theta}{2}\\right) \\left[ 1 - \\sin\\left(\\frac{\\theta}{2}\\right)\\sin\\left(\\frac{3\\theta}{2}\\right) \\right] $$\n$$ \\sigma_{xx}^{(II)} = -\\frac{K_{II}}{\\sqrt{2\\pi r}} \\sin\\left(\\frac{\\theta}{2}\\right) \\left[ 2 + \\cos\\left(\\frac{\\theta}{2}\\right)\\cos\\left(\\frac{3\\theta}{2}\\right) \\right] $$\nCombining these gives the general expression for the leading-order term for $\\sigma_{xx}$ in a mixed-mode field:\n$$ \\sigma_{xx} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi r}} \\left( K_I \\cos\\left(\\frac{\\theta}{2}\\right) \\left[ 1 - \\sin\\left(\\frac{\\theta}{2}\\right)\\sin\\left(\\frac{3\\theta}{2}\\right) \\right] - K_{II} \\sin\\left(\\frac{\\theta}{2}\\right) \\left[ 2 + \\cos\\left(\\frac{\\theta}{2}\\right)\\cos\\left(\\frac{3\\theta}{2}\\right) \\right] \\right) $$\nThe first task is to determine this expression along the line directly ahead of the crack tip, which is specified as $\\theta=0$.

The analysis will be based on the Westergaard solution for the near-tip stress field and the three-dimensional Hooke's law for an isotropic linear-elastic material.\n\nFirst, let us state the universal form of the near-tip stress components in the vicinity of a mode I crack tip, as given by the Westergaard solution, in a polar coordinate system $(r, \\theta)$ centered at the crack tip:\n$$ \\sigma_{xx} = \\frac{K_I}{\\sqrt{2 \\pi r}} \\cos\\left(\\frac{\\theta}{2}\\right) \\left[1 - \\sin\\left(\\frac{\\theta}{2}\\right) \\sin\\left(\\frac{3\\theta}{2}\\right)\\right] $$\n$$ \\sigma_{yy} = \\frac{K_I}{\\sqrt{2 \\pi r}} \\cos\\left(\\frac{\\theta}{2}\\right) \\left[1 + \\sin\\left(\\frac{\\theta}{2}\\right) \\sin\\left(\\frac{3\\theta}{2}\\right)\\right] $$\n$$ \\tau_{xy} = \\frac{K_I}{\\sqrt{2 \\pi r}} \\cos\\left(\\frac{\\theta}{2}\\right) \\sin\\left(\\frac{\\theta}{2}\\right) \\cos\\left(\\frac{3\\theta}{2}\\right) $$\nHere, $K_I$ is the mode I stress intensity factor.

At the specified point, we have $\\sigma_{xx} = \\sigma_{yy} = \\sigma_0$.\n\nThe hydrostatic stress, $H$, is defined as the mean of the principal stresses, or equivalently, the mean of the normal stress components in any orthogonal coordinate system:\n$$ H = \\frac{1}{3}(\\sigma_{xx} + \\sigma_{yy} + \\sigma_{zz}) $$\n\nWe now analyze the two cases separately.\n\nCase 1: Plane Stress\nThe defining condition for plane stress is that the stress component normal to the plane is zero. Therefore, $\\sigma_{zz} = 0$.

To find the corresponding stress $\\sigma_{zz}$, we use the three-dimensional isotropic Hooke's law, which relates strain to stress:\n$$ \\varepsilon_{zz} = \\frac{1}{E}[\\sigma_{zz} - \\nu(\\sigma_{xx} + \\sigma_{yy})] $$\nwhere $E$ is Young's modulus and $\\nu$ is Poisson's ratio.\nSetting $\\varepsilon_{zz} = 0$ gives:\n$$ 0 = \\frac{1}{E}[\\sigma_{zz} - \\nu(\\sigma_{xx} + \\sigma_{yy})] $$\n$$ \\sigma_{zz} = \\nu(\\sigma_{xx} + \\sigma_{yy}) $$\nAt the location $\\theta=0$, we substitute $\\sigma_{xx} = \\sigma_0$ and $\\sigma_{yy} = \\sigma_0$:\n$$ \\sigma_{zz} = \\nu(\\sigma_0 + \\sigma_0) = 2\\nu\\sigma_0 $$\nNow, we calculate the hydrostatic stress under plane strain conditions, $H_{\\text{plane strain}}$:\n$$ H_{\\text{plane strain}} = \\frac{1}{3}(\\sigma_{xx} + \\sigma_{yy} + \\sigma_{zz}) = \\frac{1}{3}(\\sigma_0 + \\sigma_0 + 2\\nu\\sigma_0) $$\n$$ H_{\\text{plane strain}} = \\frac{1}{3}(2\\sigma_0 + 2\\nu\\sigma_0) = \\frac{2\\sigma_0}{3}(1 + \\nu) $$\n\nFinally, we compute the required ratio of the hydrostatic stress in plane strain to that in plane stress.

A solution will be furnished.\n\nThe analysis of stresses and displacements near a crack tip in a linear elastic material can be conducted using a complex potential method, as developed by Westergaard for mode I loading. For problems with symmetry about the real axis, such as a mode I crack, the stress components can be derived from a single analytic function of a complex variable $z = x+iy$, denoted as $Z(z)$. The Airy stress function $U$ that satisfies the biharmonic equation $\\nabla^4 U = 0$ is related to $Z(z)$, and the Cartesian stress components are given by:\n$$ \\sigma_{xx} = \\text{Re}[Z(z)] - y \\text{Im}[Z'(z)] $$\n$$ \\sigma_{yy} = \\text{Re}[Z(z)] + y \\text{Im}[Z'(z)] $$\n$$ \\sigma_{xy} = -y \\text{Re}[Z'(z)] $$\nwhere $Z'(z) = dZ/dz$. For a crack lying on the negative $x$-axis, the traction-free boundary condition $\\sigma_{yy}(x,0)=0$ for $x<0$ requires that $\\text{Re}[Z(x)]=0$ for $x<0$. The stress field must be singular at the crack tip ($z=0$). An appropriate function for the leading-order singular field is $Z(z) \\propto z^{-1/2}$. The stress intensity factor, $K_I$, is defined by the limit:\n$$ K_I = \\lim_{z \\to 0} \\sqrt{2\\pi z} Z(z) $$\nThis definition establishes the asymptotic form of the Westergaard function near the crack tip:\n$$ Z(z) = \\frac{K_I}{\\sqrt{2\\pi z}} $$\nWe introduce polar coordinates $z = r e^{i\\theta}$. Thus, $z^{-1/2} = r^{-1/2} e^{-i\\theta/2}$. The Westergaard function and its derivative become:\n$$ Z(z) = \\frac{K_I}{\\sqrt{2\\pi r}} e^{-i\\theta/2} = \\frac{K_I}{\\sqrt{2\\pi r}} \\left(\\cos\\frac{\\theta}{2} - i\\sin\\frac{\\theta}{2}\\right) $$\n$$ Z'(z) = -\\frac{1}{2} \\frac{K_I}{\\sqrt{2\\pi}} z^{-3/2} = -\\frac{1}{2} \\frac{K_I}{\\sqrt{2\\pi r^3}} e^{-i3\\theta/2} = -\\frac{1}{2} \\frac{K_I}{\\sqrt{2\\pi r^3}} \\left(\\cos\\frac{3\\theta}{2} - i\\sin\\frac{3\\theta}{2}\\right) $$\nThe Cartesian stress components are found by substituting these into the Westergaard relations, with $y=r\\sin\\theta$.

The displacement field can be obtained by integrating the strain-displacement relations. For plane strain, the displacement component $v$ (in the $y$-direction) is given in terms of the shear modulus $\\mu = E/(2(1+\\nu))$ and a complex potential $Z_1(z)$ where $Z_1'(z)=Z(z)$:\n$$ 2\\mu v = 2(1-\\nu)\\text{Im}[Z_1(z)] - y\\text{Re}[Z(z)] $$\nIntegrating the Westergaard function:\n$$ Z_1(z) = \\int Z(z) dz = \\int \\frac{K_I}{\\sqrt{2\\pi z}} dz = \\frac{K_I}{\\sqrt{2\\pi}} \\int z^{-1/2} dz = \\frac{K_I}{\\sqrt{2\\pi}} (2z^{1/2}) = K_I\\sqrt{\\frac{2z}{\\pi}} $$\nThe crack opening is evaluated along the crack flanks, which for a crack on the negative real axis are at $\\theta=\\pm\\pi$. Due to symmetry, the relative opening is $\\delta(r) = v(r, \\theta=\\pi) - v(r, \\theta=-\\pi) = 2v(r, \\theta=\\pi)$. On the crack flanks, $y=0$ (since $\\sin(\\pm\\pi)=0$), so the term $y\\text{Re}[Z(z)]$ vanishes.\nWe evaluate $v$ at $\\theta=\\pi$:\n$$ Z_1(r, \\pi) = K_I\\sqrt{\\frac{2 r e^{i\\pi}}{\\pi}} = K_I\\sqrt{\\frac{2r}{\\pi}}e^{i\\pi/2} = K_I\\sqrt{\\frac{2r}{\\pi}}\\left(\\cos\\frac{\\pi}{2} + i\\sin\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\right) = i K_I\\sqrt{\\frac{2r}{\\pi}} $$\nThus, $\\text{Im}[Z_1(r,\\pi)] = K_I\\sqrt{2r/\\pi}$. The displacement of the upper crack face is:\n$$ 2\\mu v(r,\\pi) = 2(1-\\nu)K_I\\sqrt{\\frac{2r}{\\pi}} \\implies v(r,\\pi) = \\frac{K_I(1-\\nu)}{\\mu}\\sqrt{\\frac{2r}{\\pi}} $$\nThe relative crack opening displacement $\\delta(r)$ is twice the displacement of the upper flank:\n$$ \\delta(r) = 2v(r,\\pi) = \\frac{2K_I(1-\\nu)}{\\mu}\\sqrt{\\frac{2r}{\\pi}} $$\nSubstituting $\\mu = E/(2(1+\\nu))$:\n$$ \\delta(r) = \\frac{2K_I(1-\\nu)}{E/(2(1+\\nu))}\\sqrt{\\frac{2r}{\\pi}} = \\frac{4K_I(1-\\nu^2)}{E}\\sqrt{\\frac{2r}{\\pi}} $$\nThe distance $r$ here is measured from the crack tip along the crack line. The applicable elastic constant for plane strain can be expressed as the plane strain modulus $E' = E/(1-\\nu^2)$, such that $\\delta(r) = (4K_I/E')\\sqrt{2r/\\pi}$.\n\nFinally, we perform the numerical evaluation for the hoop stress $\\sigma_{\\theta\\theta}$ directly ahead of the crack tip, where $\\theta=0$, at a distance $r=0.75\\,\\mathrm{mm}$.\nAt $\\theta=0$, the hoop stress formula simplifies to:\n$$ \\sigma_{\\theta\\theta}(r,0) = \\frac{K_I}{\\sqrt{2\\pi r}} \\cos^3(0) = \\frac{K_I}{\\sqrt{2\\pi r}} $$\nThe given data are $K_I = 32.5\\,\\mathrm{MPa}\\sqrt{\\mathrm{m}}$ and $r = 0.75\\,\\mathrm{mm} = 0.75 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{m}$.\nThe values for $E$ and $\\nu$ are not needed for this stress calculation. We substitute the values, ensuring consistent units:\n$$ \\sigma_{\\theta\\theta} = \\frac{32.5\\,\\mathrm{MPa}\\sqrt{\\mathrm{m}}}{\\sqrt{2\\pi(0.75 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{m})}} = \\frac{32.5}{\\sqrt{0.0015\\pi}}\\,\\mathrm{MPa} $$\n$$ \\sigma_{\\theta\\theta} \\approx \\frac{32.5}{\\sqrt{0.004712389}}\\,\\mathrm{MPa} \\approx \\frac{32.5}{0.06864684}\\,\\mathrm{MPa} \\approx 473.435\\,\\mathrm{MPa} $$\nRounding to four significant figures as required, the hoop stress is $473.4\\,\\mathrm{MPa}$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{473.4}$$", "id": "2905129"}]}
