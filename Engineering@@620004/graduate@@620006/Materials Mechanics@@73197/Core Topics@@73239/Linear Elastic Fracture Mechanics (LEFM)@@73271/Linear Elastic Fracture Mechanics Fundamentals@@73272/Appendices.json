It is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and contains sufficient, consistent data. The problem is therefore deemed valid and a solution will be provided.\n\nThe problem requires the derivation of the relationship between the critical energy release rate, $G_c$, and the plane strain fracture toughness, $K_{IC}$, under plane strain conditions. We are to start from the fundamental definitions of the energy release rate $G$ and the $J$-integral.\n\nFor a linear elastic material, the energy release rate $G$, defined as the potential energy change per unit new crack surface area, is equivalent to the path-independent $J$-integral.\n$$G = J$$\nAt the onset of unstable crack propagation, these quantities reach their critical values, denoted $G_c$ and $J_c$ respectively. The stress state at the crack tip is characterized by the stress intensity factor $K$. At crack initiation, the mode I stress intensity factor reaches its critical value, the fracture toughness $K_{IC}$. Therefore, we have the relations:\n$$G\\to G_c, \\quad J \\to J_c, \\quad K_I \\to K_{IC}$$\nOur task is to find the relationship between $G_c$ and $K_{IC}$. The most direct method for this derivation is the virtual crack closure method, proposed by Irwin, which is a physical interpretation of the energy release rate $G$.\n\nConsider a crack of length $a$ in a plate of unit thickness. Let the crack extend by an infinitesimal amount $\\delta a$. The energy released during this extension is equal to the work required to close the crack by this amount $\\delta a$. This work is done by the stresses, which exist ahead of the original crack tip, acting over the displacements of the newly created crack surfaces.\n\nThe work done per unit crack thickness, $\\delta W$, is given by:\n$$\\delta W = \\frac{1}{2} \\int_{0}^{\\delta a} \\sigma_{yy}(r, \\theta=0) \\cdot \\left[ 2 u_y(\\delta a-r, \\theta=\\pi) \\right] dr$$\nHere, $r$ is the distance from the original crack tip. $\\sigma_{yy}(r, \\theta=0)$ is the tensile stress ahead of the original crack tip. The term $2u_y(\\delta a-r, \\theta=\\pi)$ represents the crack opening displacement (COD) at a distance $(\\delta a-r)$ from the new crack tip, which is composed of the displacement of the upper face $u_y(\\theta=\\pi)$ and the lower face $u_y(\\theta=-\\pi)$. The factor of $\\frac{1}{2}$ arises because the stresses are gradually relaxed from their full value to zero as the new crack surfaces are formed.\n\nThe energy release rate is then:\n$$G = \\lim_{\\delta a \\to 0} \\frac{\\delta W}{\\delta a} = \\lim_{\\delta a \\to 0} \\frac{1}{\\delta a} \\int_{0}^{\\delta a} \\sigma_{yy}(r, 0) u_y(\\delta a-r, \\pi) dr$$\nWe must now substitute the asymptotic crack-tip fields for mode I loading into this expression. The relevant stress and displacement components are:\n$$\\sigma_{yy}(r, \\theta=0) = \\frac{K_I}{\\sqrt{2\\pi r}}$$\nFor plane strain conditions, the crack-face displacement $u_y$ is:\n$$u_y(r, \\theta) = \\frac{K_I}{2\\mu} \\sqrt{\\frac{r}{2\\pi}} \\sin\\left(\\frac{\\theta}{2}\\right) \\left[\\kappa + 1 - 2\\cos^2\\left(\\frac{\\theta}{2}\\right)\\right]$$\nwhere $\\mu = \\frac{E}{2(1+\\nu)}$ is the shear modulus and $\\kappa = 3 - 4\\nu$ for plane strain.\nOn the upper crack face, $\\theta = \\pi$:\n$$u_y(r, \\pi) = \\frac{K_I}{2\\mu} \\sqrt{\\frac{r}{2\\pi}} \\sin\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\right) \\left[\\kappa + 1 - 2\\cos^2\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\right)\\right] = \\frac{K_I}{2\\mu} \\sqrt{\\frac{r}{2\\pi}} (\\kappa+1)$$\nSubstituting the expressions for $\\mu$ and $\\kappa$:\n$$u_y(r, \\pi) = \\frac{K_I}{2\\left(\\frac{E}{2(1+\\nu)}\\right)} \\sqrt{\\frac{r}{2\\pi}} ((3-4\\nu)+1) = \\frac{K_I (1+\\nu)}{E} \\sqrt{\\frac{r}{2\\pi}} (4-4\\nu) = \\frac{4 K_I (1+\\nu)(1-\\nu)}{E} \\sqrt{\\frac{r}{2\\pi}}$$\n$$u_y(r, \\pi) = \\frac{4 K_I (1-\\nu^2)}{E} \\sqrt{\\frac{r}{2\\pi}}$$\nNow, substituting the stress and displacement fields into the integral for $G$:\n$$G_I = \\lim_{\\delta a \\to 0} \\frac{1}{\\delta a} \\int_{0}^{\\delta a} \\left( \\frac{K_I}{\\sqrt{2\\pi r}} \\right) \\left( \\frac{4 K_I (1-\\nu^2)}{E} \\sqrt{\\frac{\\delta a-r}{2\\pi}} \\right) dr$$\n$$G_I = \\frac{4 K_I^2 (1-\\nu^2)}{2\\pi E} \\lim_{\\delta a \\to 0} \\frac{1}{\\delta a} \\int_{0}^{\\delta a} \\sqrt{\\frac{\\delta a-r}{r}} dr$$\nTo solve the integral, we perform a substitution.

It is scientifically grounded in established principles of LEFM and FEM, specifically concepts related to the Virtual Crack Closure Technique (VCCT). The problem is well-posed, providing all necessary data for each test case, and is free of contradictions or ambiguities. The data provided are physically realistic. The problem is therefore deemed **valid**.\n\nWe now proceed with the solution derivation, starting from first principles.\n\nThe energy release rate, $G$, is defined as the negative rate of change of the total potential energy, $\\Pi$, with respect to the crack area, $A$. For a finite crack growth, $\\Delta a$, this is approximated as:\n$$G \\approx -\\frac{\\Delta \\Pi}{\\Delta A}$$\nThe change in crack surface area, $\\Delta A$, for a through-crack in a body of thickness $B$ is given by $\\Delta A = B \\cdot \\Delta a$.\n\nThe quantity $-\\Delta \\Pi$ represents the energy that becomes available to drive the fracture process. In a discrete FEM context, this energy can be calculated as the work required to close the newly formed crack faces. Under the assumption of linear elasticity, the work done by a nodal force $F_i$ moving through a displacement $\\Delta v_i$ is $\\dfrac{1}{2} F_i \\Delta v_i$. The logic of the Virtual Crack Closure Technique (VCCT) posits that the work to close the crack over an extension $\\Delta a$ is approximately equal to the work done by the nodal forces at the original crack tip (state $1$) moving through the opening displacements of the extended crack (state $2$). The problem provides the nodal reaction forces $\\{F_i\\}$ at the extended crack tip and the relative opening displacements $\\{\\Delta v_i\\}$ at the original crack tip, which is a common implementation of this method.\n\nThe total energy released is the sum of the work done by all the paired nodal forces:\n$$-\\Delta \\Pi = \\frac{1}{2} \\sum_{i} F_i \\Delta v_i$$\nThis is the work released during the creation of the new crack surface.\n\nThe Mode I energy release rate, $G_I$, is then computed by normalizing this energy by the created crack area:\n$$G_I = \\frac{-\\Delta \\Pi}{\\Delta A} = \\frac{\\frac{1}{2} \\sum_{i} F_i \\Delta v_i}{B \\cdot \\Delta a}$$\n\nNext, we relate $G_I$ to the Mode I stress intensity factor, $K_I$, using the Irwin relation:\n$$K_I^2 = E' G_I$$\nwhere $E'$ is the effective Young's modulus, which depends on the kinematic constraint:\n- For plane stress: $E' = E$\n- For plane strain: $E' = \\frac{E}{1 - \\nu^2}$\n\nCombining these equations, we obtain the expression for $K_I$:\n$$K_I = \\sqrt{E' G_I} = \\sqrt{E' \\left( \\frac{\\sum_{i} F_i \\Delta v_i}{2 B \\Delta a} \\right)}$$\nThe units for all input quantities are SI base units (Pa, N, m). The calculation of $G_I$ results in units of Joules per square meter (J/m$^2$), which is equivalent to N/m or Pa$\\cdot$m. The computation of $K_I^2 = E' G_I$ has units of Pa $\\cdot$ (Pa$\\cdot$m) = Pa$^2\\cdot$m. Consequently, $K_I$ has units of Pa$\\cdot\\sqrt{\\text{m}}$. The final result must be converted to MPa$\\cdot\\sqrt{\\text{m}}$ by multiplying by a factor of $10^{-6}$.\n\nWe now apply this formulation to each test case.\n\n**Test Case 1: Plane Strain**\n- $E = 210 \\times 10^9$ Pa, $\\nu = 0.3$, $B = 0.01$ m, $\\Delta a = 0.001$ m.\n- $F = [1200.0, 800.0]$ N, $\\Delta v = [3.0 \\times 10^{-5}, 2.0 \\times 10^{-5}]$ m.\n- First, calculate the work term:\n  $$\\sum_{i} F_i \\Delta v_i = (1200.0)(3.0 \\times 10^{-5}) + (800.0)(2.0 \\times 10^{-5}) = 0.036 + 0.016 = 0.052 \\text{ J}$$\n- Then, calculate $G_I$:\n  $$G_I = \\frac{\\frac{1}{2}(0.052)}{0.01 \\cdot 0.001} = \\frac{0.026}{10^{-5}} = 2.6 \\times 10^6 \\text{ J/m}^2$$\n- For plane strain, calculate $E'$:\n  $$E' = \\frac{210 \\times 10^9}{1 -
