It is scientifically grounded in linear elastic fracture mechanics, well-posed, objective, and contains all necessary information for a complete solution. We shall proceed.\n\nThe problem requires two distinct tasks. First, to derive the relationship between the mode I elastic energy release rate $G$ and the mode I stress-intensity factor $K_I$ under plane strain conditions. Second, to compute a numerical value for $G$ for a specific specimen geometry and loading.\n\nWe begin with the first task. The foundation is Griffith's energy balance criterion, which posits that a crack will extend when the energy released from the elastic body is sufficient to create new crack surfaces. The energy release rate, $G$, is defined as the rate of change of the system's potential energy, $\\Pi$, with respect to the crack area, $A$. For a straight-through crack of length $a$ in a specimen of uniform thickness $B$, the crack area is $A = B a$. Thus,\n$$G = -\\frac{d\\Pi}{dA} = -\\frac{1}{B}\\frac{d\\Pi}{da}$$\nIrwin's great contribution was to show that $G$ can be calculated from the local stress and displacement fields at the crack tip. The energy released during a small crack extension, $\\Delta a$, is equal to the work that must be done to close this newly created crack segment back to its original state. This is the basis of the crack closure integral.\n\nConsider a virtual crack extension of infinitesimal length $\\Delta a$. The energy released per unit thickness, $G \\Delta a$, is equal to the work done by the stresses $\\sigma_{yy}(r, \\theta=0)$ that exist on the crack plane as the crack opens by a total displacement of $2 \\cdot u_y(\\Delta a-r, \\theta=\\pi)$. This gives the crack closure integral, where $r$ is the distance from the original crack tip along the crack line, and $\\Delta a - r$ is the distance from the new crack tip:\n$$G \\Delta a = \\int_0^{\\Delta a} \\sigma_{yy}(r, \\theta=0) [2 \\cdot u_y(\\Delta a - r, \\theta=\\pi)] dr$$\nFrom linear elastic fracture mechanics, the asymptotic stress field ahead of a mode I crack tip is given by:\n$$\\sigma_{yy}(r, \\theta=0) = \\frac{K_I}{\\sqrt{2\\pi r}}$$\nThe asymptotic displacement field for a point on the crack flank $(\\theta=\\pi)$ is needed. The general form for the vertical displacement is:\n$$u_y(r', \\theta) = \\frac{K_I}{2\\mu} \\sqrt{\\frac{r'}{2\\pi}} \\sin\\left(\\frac{\\theta}{2}\\right) \\left[ \\frac{\\kappa+1}{2} - \\cos^2\\left(\\frac{\\theta}{2}\\right) \\right]$$\nwhere $r'$ is the radial distance from the current crack-tip, $\\mu$ is the shear modulus, and $\\kappa$ is a material parameter dependent on the stress state. For plane strain, we have:\n$$\\kappa = 3 - 4\\nu \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\mu = \\frac{E}{2(1+\\nu)}$$\nwhere $E$ is Young's modulus and $\\nu$ is Poisson's ratio.

This requires the specimen to be thick enough to maintain a state of high constraint at the crack tip, which suppresses plastic deformation.

It is a standard problem in the field of linear elastic fracture mechanics and is therefore valid for solution.\n\nThe problem requires a derivation of the specimen thickness requirement for valid plane-strain fracture toughness testing, an explanation of its connection to fundamental energy principles, and a final calculation.\n\nFirst, we will establish the basis for the thickness requirement. The stress field near the tip of a Mode I crack in a linear elastic material is characterized by the stress intensity factor, $K_I$. Along the plane ahead of the crack ($\\theta=0$), the stress component normal to the crack plane, $\\sigma_{yy}$, is given by:\n$$\n\\sigma_{yy}(r, \\theta=0) = \\frac{K_I}{\\sqrt{2\\pi r}}\n$$\nwhere $r$ is the distance from the crack tip. This equation predicts an unphysical stress singularity at $r=0$. In a real material with a finite yield strength, $\\sigma_Y$, yielding occurs when the local stress reaches this value. A small region of plasticity, known as the plastic zone, forms at the crack tip. A first-order estimate for the size of this plastic zone, $r_p$, can be obtained by finding the distance $r$ at which $\\sigma_{yy}$ equals $\\sigma_Y$:\n$$\n\\sigma_Y = \\frac{K_I}{\\sqrt{2\\pi r_p}} \\implies r_p = \\frac{1}{2\\pi} \\left(\\frac{K_I}{\\sigma_Y}\\right)^2\n$$\nThis is a simplified estimate. Irwin's model, accounting for the stress redistribution caused by yielding, provides a more accurate estimate for the plastic zone size. The size depends critically on the state of stress: plane stress or plane strain.\n\nAt the free surfaces of a specimen of thickness $B$, the stress component normal to the surface, $\\sigma_{zz}$, must be zero, leading to a state of plane stress. In the interior of the specimen, if it is sufficiently thick, the material is constrained in the thickness direction, leading to $\\epsilon_{zz} \\approx 0$, which defines a state of plane strain. The plane-strain condition creates a triaxial stress state that inhibits plastic flow, resulting in a smaller plastic zone compared to the plane-stress condition. The approximate plastic zone sizes, $r_p$, are:\n$$\nr_p^{\\text{plane stress}} \\approx \\frac{1}{\\pi} \\left(\\frac{K_I}{\\sigma_Y}\\right)^2\n$$\n$$\nr_p^{\\text{plane strain}} \\approx \\frac{1}{3\\pi} \\left(\\frac{K_I}{\\sigma_Y}\\right)^2\n$$\nFor a toughness measurement to be a valid plane-strain fracture toughness, $K_{Ic}$, the crack tip must be predominantly under plane-strain conditions. This means the specimen thickness, $B$, must be substantially larger than the extent of the plane-stress plastic zones that develop at the free surfaces. The governing dimension is the size of the larger, plane-stress plastic zone. The requirement is that the thickness $B$ must be much greater than the plastic zone diameter, which is $2r_p$. A conservative condition is thus set for $B$ relative to $r_p^{\\text{plane stress}}$:\n$$\nB \\gg r_p^{\\text{plane stress}}\n$$\nLet us express this as a formal requirement: $B \\ge C_0 \\cdot r_p^{\\text{plane stress}}$, where $C_0$ is a dimensionless factor substantially greater than one. Substituting the expression for the plane-stress plastic zone size and using $K_I = K_{Ic}$ at fracture:\n$$\nB \\ge C_0 \\frac{1}{\\pi} \\left(\\frac{K_{Ic}}{\\sigma_Y}\\right)^2\n$$\nCombining the constants $C_0$ and $\\pi$ into a single coefficient $C = C_0 / \\pi$, we arrive at the required form:\n$$\nB \\ge C \\left(\\frac{K_{Ic}}{\\sigma_Y}\\right)^2\n$$\nThe value of the coefficient $C$ is determined empirically to ensure that the measured toughness value is independent of specimen thickness, which is the defining characteristic of a true material property. To justify its order of magnitude, consider that to achieve a dominant plane-strain core, the thickness $B$ should be many times the plastic zone size. If we mandate, for instance, that $B$ be approximately $8$ times the plastic zone radius, $r_p^{\\text{plane stress}}$, then $C_0 \\approx 8$. This leads to $C = 8/\\pi \\approx 2.55$. Experimental validation, as codified in standards such as ASTM E399, has established the value $C=2.5$. This value ensures that the size of the central plane-strain region is large enough that the surface plane-stress effects are negligible, and a state of high triaxiality is maintained.\n\nNext, we connect this to the Griffith energy criterion. The Griffith criterion, for a perfectly brittle material, posits that crack extension occurs when the energy release rate, $G$, equals the critical energy required to create new surfaces, $G_c = 2\\gamma_s$. Irwin extended this to ductile materials by showing that $G$ is related to the stress intensity factor $K$. For Mode I loading, the relations are:\n$$\nG_I = \\frac{K_I^2}{E} \\quad (\\text{plane stress})\n$$\n$$\nG_I = \\frac{K_I^2(1-\\nu^2)}{E} \\quad (\\text{plane strain})\n$$\nwhere $E$ is Young's modulus and $\\nu$ is Poisson's ratio. At fracture initiation, $K_I = K_c$ and $G_I = G_c$. The value of $G_c$, and therefore $K_c$, depends on the stress state. Plane strain provides greater constraint against plastic deformation, resulting in a lower energy dissipation and thus a lower toughness value. This minimum, thickness-independent toughness is denoted $K_{Ic}$, the plane-strain fracture toughness. The thickness requirement $B \\ge C(K_{Ic}/\\sigma_Y)^2$ is therefore a geometric constraint that forces the mechanical state at the crack tip into the plane-strain regime. By doing so, it ensures that the measured stress intensity factor at fracture corresponds to the true, minimum critical energy release rate, $G_{Ic} = K_{Ic}^2(1-\\nu^2)/E$, which is a fundamental material property.\n\nFinally, we compute the minimum required thickness, $B_{\\min}$, for the given steel. We use the justified and standardized coefficient $C=2.5$.\nThe given properties are $K_{Ic} = 55\\,\\mathrm{MPa}\\sqrt{\\mathrm{m}}$ and $\\sigma_Y = 1.00 \\times 10^{3}\\,\\mathrm{MPa}$.\nThe formula for minimum thickness is:\n$$\nB_{\\min} = C \\left(\\frac{K_{Ic}}{\\sigma_Y}\\right)^2\n$$\nSubstituting the values:\n$$\nB_{\\min} = 2.5 \\times \\left(\\frac{55\\,\\mathrm{MPa}\\sqrt{\\mathrm{m}}}{1000\\,\\mathrm{MPa}}\\right)^2\n$$\nThe units of the ratio inside the parenthesis are $\\sqrt{\\mathrm{m}}$.

The uncorrected, purely elastic values are denoted by a superscript $(0)$:\n$$K_I^{(0)} = Y\\sigma\\sqrt{\\pi a}$$\n$$G^{(0)} = \\frac{\\left(K_I^{(0)}\\right)^2}{E'}$$\n\nThe corrected stress intensity factor, $K_I$, is found by replacing $a$ with $a_{\\text{eff}}$:\n$$K_I = Y\\sigma\\sqrt{\\pi a_{\\text{eff}}} = Y\\sigma\\sqrt{\\pi (a + \\Delta a)} = Y\\sigma\\sqrt{\\pi a \\left(1 + \\frac{\\Delta a}{a}\\right)}$$\n$$K_I = \\left(Y\\sigma\\sqrt{\\pi a}\\right) \\left(1 + \\frac{\\Delta a}{a}\\right)^{1/2} = K_I^{(0)} \\left(1 + \\frac{\\Delta a}{a}\\right)^{1/2}$$\nUsing the Taylor expansion $(1+x)^p \\approx 1 + px$ for small $x$, with $x = \\Delta a / a$ and $p = 1/2$, we obtain the first-order approximation:\n$$K_I \\approx K_I^{(0)} \\left(1 + \\frac{1}{2}\\frac{\\Delta a}{a}\\right)$$\n\nNext, we find the corrected energy release rate, $G$:\n$$G = \\frac{K_I^2}{E'} \\approx \\frac{1}{E'} \\left[ K_I^{(0)} \\left(1 + \\frac{1}{2}\\frac{\\Delta a}{a}\\right) \\right]^2 = \\frac{\\left(K_I^{(0)}\\right)^2}{E'} \\left(1 + \\frac{1}{2}\\frac{\\Delta a}{a}\\right)^2$$\n$$G \\approx G^{(0)} \\left(1 + 2\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\frac{\\Delta a}{a}\\right) + \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\frac{\\Delta a}{a}\\right)^2\\right) = G^{(0)} \\left(1 + \\frac{\\Delta a}{a} + \\frac{1}{4}\\left(\\frac{\\Delta a}{a}\\right)^2\\right)$$\nRetaining only terms up to the first order in $\\Delta a / a$:\n$$G \\approx G^{(0)} \\left(1 + \\frac{\\Delta a}{a}\\right)$$\n\nNow, we evaluate each statement.\n\n**A. Under small-scale yielding with $\\Delta a/a \\ll 1$, the stress intensity factor increases approximately as $K_I \\approx K_I^{(0)}\\left[1+\\tfrac{1}{2}\\left(\\Delta a/a\\right)\\right]$ and the energy release rate increases as $G \\approx G^{(0)}\\left[1+\\left(\\Delta a/a\\right)\\right]$, where $K_I^{(0)}=Y\\,\\sigma\\,\\sqrt{\\pi a}$ and $G^{(0)}=\\left(K_I^{(0)}\\right)^2/E'$ are the linear-elastic values for crack length $a$.**\nThis statement presents the results of the first-order Taylor expansion derived above. Our derivations for both $K_I$ and $G$ match the expressions given in the statement precisely.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. Because the plastic zone locally shields the crack tip, the effective crack length must be $a_{\\text{eff}}=a-\\Delta a$ with $\\Delta a>0$, so at fixed $\\sigma$ the correction reduces $K_I$ relative to the linear-elastic value.**\nThis statement is fundamentally incorrect. The formation of a plastic zone signifies irreversible deformation, which relaxes the local stress singularity but does so by effectively extending the non-load-bearing region. The crack behaves as if it were *longer*, not shorter. The concept of \"shielding\" is misapplied here; plasticity increases the driving force for fracture at a given far-field load, it does not reduce it. The model is explicitly $a_{\\text{eff}}=a+\\Delta a$. A shorter crack ($a-\\Delta a$) would lead to a *lower* stress intensity factor, which contradicts the physical effect of plasticity in this context.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. The modification $a\\mapsto a_{\\text{eff}}$ affects $G$ only through the effective modulus $E'$; therefore, if $E$ and $\\nu$ are fixed, $G$ is unchanged by $\\Delta a$ to first order.**\nThis statement contains a logical fallacy. The modification $a \\mapsto a_{\\text{eff}}$ acts on the geometric parameter $a$, which is a primary determinant of $K_I$. The energy release rate is $G=K_I^2/E'$. Since $K_I$ changes due to the change in effective crack length, $G$ must also change. The material parameters $E$ and $\\nu$ (and thus $E'$) are held constant. Our derivation shows that $G$ increases by a first-order term: $G \\approx G^{(0)}(1 + \\Delta a/a)$. The claim that $G$ is anchanged is false.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. The physical rationale for $a_{\\text{eff}}$ is that the near-tip plastic zone of size $r_p$ blunts the crack and shifts the location at which the elastic singular fields would nominally apply forward by a distance on the order of $r_p$, so that the same far-field loading behaves as if the crack were longer by $\\Delta a \\approx c\\,r_p$ with $c$ of order $1$.**\nThis statement correctly describes the physical basis for the Irwin correction. The infinite stress predicted by LEFM is unphysical; real materials yield. The stress is capped at the yield strength $\\sigma_Y$ within the plastic zone. This stress redistribution and crack tip blunting cause the surrounding elastic field to behave as if it originates from an \"effective\" crack tip located ahead of the physical tip. The position of this effective tip is shifted by a distance on the order of the plastic zone size, $r_p$. Thus, the effective crack length correction is $\\Delta a = c r_p$, where $c$ is a constant of order unity. This is the canonical explanation.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**E. If $\\Delta a \\sim r_p$ and $r_p \\propto \\left(K_I/\\sigma_Y\\right)^2$, then the corrected $K_I$ is, in principle, defined implicitly and may require iteration; however, when $r_p \\ll a$ the first-order expansion in $\\Delta a/a$ remains self-consistent and accurate to leading order.**\nThis statement addresses the self-consistency of the model. We have the following chain of dependencies:\n$1$. The corrected stress intensity factor is a function of $a_{\\text{eff}}$: $K_I = Y\\sigma\\sqrt{\\pi a_{\\text{eff}}} = Y\\sigma\\sqrt{\\pi(a+\\Delta a)}$.\n$2$. The correction $\\Delta a$ is proportional to the plastic zone size $r_p$: $\\Delta a \\propto r_p$.\n$3$. The plastic zone size $r_p$ is a function of the corrected stress intensity factor $K_I$: $r_p \\propto (K_I/\\sigma_Y)^2$.\nSubstituting $(3)$ and $(2)$ into $(1)$ yields $K_I = f(a, \\sigma, K_I)$, which is an implicit equation for $K_I$. To solve it, one typically iterates: start with $K_I^{(0)}=Y\\sigma\\sqrt{\\pi a}$, calculate a first estimate of $r_p$ and $\\Delta a$, then calculate an updated $K_I^{(1)}$, and repeat until convergence. The small-scale yielding condition, $r_p \\ll a$, implies $\\Delta a \\ll a$, which ensures that the iterative process converges rapidly and that a first-order correction (using only the first iteration) is a very good approximation. The statement correctly describes this situation.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**F. In plane stress, $r_p \\approx \\dfrac{1}{2\\pi}\\left(\\dfrac{K_I}{\\sigma_Y}\\right)^2$, whereas in plane strain, $r_p \\approx \\dfrac{1}{6\\pi}\\left(\\dfrac{K_I}{\\sigma_Y}\\right)^2$; hence, for the same $\\sigma$ and $a$, the Irwin effective-length correction is larger in plane stress than in plane strain.**\nThe initial formulas provided are the standard Irwin estimates for the plastic zone extent along the crack line, derived by finding the distance from the tip at which the LEFM stress $\\sigma_{yy}$ equals the yield stress $\\sigma_Y$. The smaller plastic zone in plane strain arises from the triaxial stress state near the tip, which constrains plastic flow. For a given material ($\\sigma_Y$) and stress intensity factor ($K_I$), the plastic zone size in plane stress is larger than in plane strain (by a factor of approximately $3$). Since the correction $\\Delta a$ is proportional to $r_p$, it follows that $\\Delta a$ is also larger in plane stress. Given the same geometry, crack length $a$, and applied stress $\\sigma$, the initial uncorrected $K_I^{(0)}$ is the same for both cases. Therefore, the subsequent plastic zone and the correction $\\Delta a$ will be larger for the plane stress case. The statement is entirely correct.\n**Verdict: Correct.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{ADEF}$$", "id": "2890344"}]}
