Therefore, we deduce the effective modulus for plane strain is:\n$$ E'_{\\text{pe}} = \\frac{E}{1-\\nu^2} $$\n\n**Ratio of Energetic Measures**\nThe problem states that for small-scale yielding, the $J$-integral is the relevant energetic measure of the crack driving force. In LEFM, the $J$-integral is equivalent to the energy release rate $G$. The foundational relationship is $J = G = \\frac{K_I^2}{E'}$, where $K_I$ is the Mode I stress intensity factor.\nFor plane stress, using $E'_{\\text{ps}} = E$:\n$$ J_{\\text{ps}} = \\frac{K^2}{E} $$\nFor plane strain, using $E'_{\\text{pe}} = \\frac{E}{1-\\nu^2}$:\n$$ J_{\\text{pe}} = \\frac{K^2}{E / (1-\\nu^2)} = \\frac{K^2(1-\\nu^2)}{E} $$\nThe problem stipulates that $K$ is the same for both cases. The ratio of the $J$-integrals is therefore:\n$$ \\frac{J_{\\text{ps}}}{J_{\\text{pe}}} = \\frac{K^2/E}{K^2(1-\\nu^2)/E} = \\frac{1}{1-\\nu^2} $$\nThis result demonstrates that for the same applied stress intensity factor, the crack driving force is larger under plane stress than under plane strain ($J_{\\text{ps}} > J_{\\text{pe}}$ since $\\nu \\ge 0$). This is because a plane strain condition imposes a greater constraint on the material, making it effectively stiffer and thus storing less strain energy for a given stress state.\n\n**Numerical Evaluation**\nWe are asked to evaluate this ratio for $\\nu = 0.33$:\n$$ \\frac{J_{\\text{ps}}}{J_{\\text{pe}}} = \\frac{1}{1 - (0.33)^2} = \\frac{1}{1 - 0.1089} = \\frac{1}{0.8911} $$\n$$ \\frac{J_{\\text{ps}}}{J_{\\text{pe}}} \\approx 1.1222085 $$\nRounding the result to $4$ significant figures, we obtain $1.122$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{1.122}\n$$", "id": "2874870"}, {"introduction": "The Irwin and Dugdale models represent two cornerstone approaches to estimating the size and effect of the crack-tip plastic zone.

The goal is to compare the Irwin plastic-zone estimate and the Dugdale predictions derived from first principles.\n\nBackground and fundamental basis:\n- Consider a through-thickness center crack of half-length $a$ in an infinite plate under a uniform remote tensile stress $\\sigma$ (mode I). Linear Elastic Fracture Mechanics (LEFM) gives the mode I stress intensity factor $K_I = \\sigma \\sqrt{\\pi a}$ for this geometry.\n- For plane stress, Irwin’s plastic-zone estimate is based on the near-tip LEFM singular field and the yielding condition $\\sigma_{yy}(r_p) = \\sigma_y$ at the plastic-zone boundary, which yields $r_p^{\\mathrm{Irwin}} = \\dfrac{1}{2 \\pi}\\left(\\dfrac{K_I}{\\sigma_y}\\right)^2$.\n- In the Dugdale strip-yield model (a cohesive-zone model with constant traction equal to the yield stress $\\sigma_y$), the plastic zone ahead of the crack tip extends a length $d$ beyond the crack tip on each side, such that the net stress intensity factor at the plastic-zone tip vanishes. The resulting condition provides a relation between $a$, $d$, $\\sigma$, and $\\sigma_y$. The crack-tip opening displacement $\\delta$ at the original crack tip ($x = a$) can be obtained from an energy balance using the $J$-integral equivalence $J = K_I^2/E'$ and the work of separation for a perfectly plastic traction–separation law, $J = \\int_0^{\\delta} T(\\Delta)\\, d\\Delta = \\sigma_y \\delta$. For plane stress, take $E' = E$ where $E$ is Young’s modulus; for plane strain, $E' = \\dfrac{E}{1-\\nu^2}$ where $\\nu$ is Poisson’s ratio. In this task, assume plane stress, so $E' = E$.\n\nMathematical tasks to implement for each test case:\n1) Given $(E,\\nu,a,\\sigma,\\sigma_y)$ in International System of Units (SI), compute the LEFM stress intensity factor $K_I = \\sigma \\sqrt{\\pi a}$.\n2) Compute Irwin’s plane-stress plastic-zone estimate $r_p^{\\mathrm{Irwin}} = \\dfrac{1}{2 \\pi}\\left(\\dfrac{K_I}{\\sigma_y}\\right)^2$.\n3) Impose Dugdale’s zero-singularity condition at the plastic-zone tip for a center crack with a constant cohesive traction equal to $\\sigma_y$. This yields an equation that can be rearranged to an explicit form for $d$:\n   $$\\frac{\\sigma}{\\sigma_y} = \\cos\\!\\left(\\frac{\\pi a}{2(a+d)}\\right) \\quad \\Longrightarrow \\quad d = \\frac{\\pi a}{2 \\arccos\\!\\left(\\sigma/\\sigma_y\\right)} - a.$$\n   Use this to compute the Dugdale plastic-zone extension $d$ (plane stress).\n4) Compute the Dugdale crack-tip opening displacement at $x=a$ by energy balance for a perfectly plastic cohesive law:\n   $$\\delta = \\frac{J}{\\sigma_y} = \\frac{K_I^2}{E' \\sigma_y} = \\frac{K_I^2}{E \\sigma_y} \\quad \\text{(plane stress)}.$$\n\nScientific realism requirements and modeling notes:\n- Assume small-scale yielding and monotonic loading so that $J = K_I^2/E'$ holds, and the work of separation per unit crack advance in Dugdale’s idealization equals $\\sigma_y \\delta$.\n- Assume $0 < \\sigma < \\sigma_y$ so that the arccosine is well-defined and $d$ is finite and nonnegative.\n- Treat the plate as effectively infinite relative to $a$.\n\nNumerical and output requirements:\n- All inputs are specified in SI units.

It is scientifically grounded in the established theories of Linear Elastic Fracture Mechanics (LEFM) and cohesive zone modeling, specifically the Irwin and Dugdale models. All provided equations are correct representations of these models under the specified conditions of plane stress, and the input parameters are physically realistic. The problem is self-contained, with all necessary data and constraints clearly defined for a unique, verifiable solution. Therefore, the problem is valid, and we may proceed to the solution.\n\nThe objective is to compute three quantities for a series of test cases concerning a center-cracked infinite plate under mode I loading: the Dugdale plastic-zone extension $d$, the Dugdale crack-tip opening displacement $\\delta$, and the Irwin plastic-zone size estimate $r_p^{\\mathrm{Irwin}}$. The plate is considered to be in a state of plane stress. The calculation for each test case, given as ($E, \\nu, a, \\sigma, \\sigma_y$), proceeds through a logical sequence of steps derived from fundamental principles.\n\nStep 1: Computation of the Mode I Stress Intensity Factor, $K_I$.\nFor a through-thickness center crack of total length $2a$, or half-length $a$, in an infinite plate subjected to a remote uniform tensile stress $\\sigma$, the stress intensity factor under mode I loading is given by the fundamental LEFM solution:\n$$K_I = \\sigma \\sqrt{\\pi a}$$\nThis quantity represents the magnitude of the crack-tip stress singularity and is the basis for all subsequent fracture mechanics calculations. It is a function of the applied load and the geometry of the crack.\n\nStep 2: Computation of the Irwin Plastic-Zone Size Estimate, $r_p^{\\mathrm{Irwin}}$.\nIrwin's model provides a first-order correction to LEFM by estimating the extent of the plastic zone ahead of the crack tip. The model uses the LEFM solution for the stress field near the crack tip, $\\sigma_{yy}(r, \\theta=0) \\approx K_I / \\sqrt{2 \\pi r}$, and posits that the plastic zone boundary is located at the radius $r_p$ where this stress equals the material's yield strength, $\\sigma_y$. For plane stress conditions, this yields:\n$$\\sigma_y = \\frac{K_I}{\\sqrt{2 \\pi r_p^{\\mathrm{Irwin}}}}$$\nSolving for the plastic zone size, $r_p^{\\mathrm{Irwin}}$, we obtain:\n$$r_p^{\\mathrm{Irwin}} = \\frac{1}{2 \\pi}\\left(\\frac{K_I}{\\sigma_y}\\right)^2$$\nThis estimate is based on the redistribution of stress but does not enforce equilibrium on the modified stress field. It is primarily useful for assessing whether the assumption of small-scale yielding is valid.\n\nStep 3: Computation of the Dugdale Plastic-Zone Extension, $d$.\nThe Dugdale model provides a more physically rigorous picture by idealizing the plastic zone as a thin strip of yielded material ahead of the crack tip. A constant cohesive traction, equal to the yield stress $\\sigma_y$, acts over this strip, opposing the crack opening. The length of this strip, $d$, is determined by the condition that the stress singularity at the tip of the extended crack (physical crack tip + plastic zone) must be zero. The stress intensity factor from the remote stress $\\sigma$ on a crack of effective half-length $(a+d)$ is counteracted by the stress intensity factor from the cohesive tractions $\\sigma_y$ acting over the region from $x=a$ to $x=a+d$. This balance leads to the following exact relationship:\n$$\\frac{\\pi \\sigma}{2 \\sigma_y} = \\arccos\\left(\\frac{a}{a+d}\\right)$$\nThis is equivalent to the form given in the problem statement:\n$$\\frac{\\sigma}{\\sigma_y} = \\cos\\left(\\frac{\\pi a}{2(a+d)}\\right)$$\nInverting this equation to solve for the plastic zone extension $d$ gives the required computational formula:\n$$d = a \\left( \\sec\\left(\\frac{\\pi \\sigma}{2 \\sigma_y}\\right) - 1 \\right)$$\nOr, using the provided form which is numerically more convenient:\n$$d = \\frac{\\pi a}{2 \\arccos(\\sigma/\\sigma_y)} - a$$\nThis expression directly gives the length of the yielded strip.\n\nStep 4: Computation of the Dugdale Crack-Tip Opening Displacement, $\\delta$.\nThe crack-tip opening displacement (CTOD), denoted $\\delta$, is the displacement between the crack faces at the location of the original physical crack tip ($x=a$). In the context of the Dugdale model, $\\delta$ can be determined through an energy balance argument using the $J$-integral. For a perfectly plastic material, the work of separation per unit area of crack extension is $J = \\sigma_y \\delta$. Under monotonic loading and small-scale yielding conditions, the $J$-integral is equivalent to the elastic energy release rate, $G$. For plane stress, $G = K_I^2 / E$. Equating these gives:\n$$J = \\sigma_y \\delta = \\frac{K_I^2}{E'}$$\nWhere $E'$ is the effective Young's modulus. For plane stress, as specified, $E' = E$. Therefore, we solve for $\\delta$:\n$$\\delta = \\frac{K_I^2}{E \\sigma_y}$$\nThis provides the opening at the crack tip, a critical parameter for assessing ductile fracture initiation. Note that the provided Poisson's ratio, $\\nu$, is not required for any of these plane stress calculations but would be necessary for plane strain where $E' = E / (1-\\nu^2)$.\n\nThe implementation will apply these four sequential steps to each test case to compute the three specified output quantities: $d$, $\\delta$, and $r_p^{\\mathrm{Irwin}}$.", "answer": "```python\n# The complete and runnable Python 3 code goes here.\n# Imports must adhere to the specified execution environment.\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Computes Dugdale and Irwin plastic zone parameters for a center crack\n    in an infinite plate under plane stress.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Define the test cases from the problem statement.\n    # Each case is a tuple: (E, nu, a, sigma, sigma_y) in SI units.\n    test_cases = [\n        # Case 1 (steel-like, moderate load)\n        (2.10e11, 0.30, 1.00e-2, 2.00e8, 4.00e8),\n        # Case 2 (aluminum-like, low load)\n        (7.00e10, 0.33, 5.00e-3, 5.00e7, 3.50e8),\n        # Case 3 (near-yield, larger crack)\n        (2.10e11, 0.30, 2.00e-2, 5.40e8, 6.00e8),\n        # Case 4 (small crack, high strength)\n        (2.00e11, 0.30, 5.00e-4, 1.00e8, 1.00e9),\n    ]\n\n    results = []\n    for case in test_cases:\n        E, nu, a, sigma, sigma_y = case\n\n        # 1) Compute the LEFM stress intensity factor K_I\n        K_I = sigma * np.sqrt(np.pi * a)\n\n        # 2) Compute Irwin's plane-stress plastic-zone estimate r_p_Irwin\n        r_p_irwin = (1 / (2 * np.pi)) * (K_I / sigma_y)**2\n\n        # 3) Compute the Dugdale plastic-zone extension d\n        # The condition sigma < sigma_y is guaranteed by the problem statement.\n        # d = a * (sec(pi*sigma / (2*sigma_y)) - 1) is an alternative form.\n        # The form below using arccos is provided in the problem.\n        sigma_ratio = sigma / sigma_y\n        d_dugdale = (np.pi * a) / (2 * np.arccos(sigma_ratio)) - a\n\n        # 4) Compute the Dugdale crack-tip opening displacement delta\n        # For plane stress, E' = E.\n        delta_dugdale = K_I**2 / (E * sigma_y)\n        \n        # Aggregate the results in the specified order: [d, delta, r_p_Irwin]\n        # All results are in meters.\n        results.append([d_dugdale, delta_dugdale, r_p_irwin])\n\n    # Final print statement in the exact required format.\n    # Convert the list of lists to the required string representation.\n    output_str = \"[\" + \",\".join([f\"[{d},{delta},{rp}]\" for d, delta, rp in results]) + \"]\"\n    print(output_str)\n\nsolve()\n```", "id": "2874860"}, {"introduction": "A key application of plastic zone models is to correct experimental data that falls outside the strict requirements of Linear Elastic Fracture Mechanics (LEFM).

A self-consistent model requires that this stress field be characterized by the corrected stress intensity factor, $K_{Ic,\\text{corr}}$, since it is this value that represents the true intensity of the singular field driving plasticity at the moment of fracture.\nUsing Basis 1, the stress field at fracture is:\n$$\\sigma_{yy}(r,0) = \\frac{K_{Ic,\\text{corr}}}{\\sqrt{2\\pi r}}$$\nApplying Basis 2, we set the stress at the boundary of the plastic zone, $r=r_p$, equal to the yield stress $\\sigma_Y$:\n$$\\sigma_{yy}(r_p,0) = \\frac{K_{Ic,\\text{corr}}}{\\sqrt{2\\pi r_p}} = \\sigma_{Y}$$\nSolving for $r_p$ yields:\n$$r_p = \\frac{1}{2\\pi} \\left( \\frac{K_{Ic,\\text{corr}}}{\\sigma_Y} \\right)^2$$\nNote that this expression for $r_p$ is for the plane stress condition, as specified.\n\nWe now have a system of three equations. We substitute the expression for $r_p$ into the equation for $a_{\\text{eff}}$:\n$$a_{\\text{eff}} = a + \\frac{1}{2\\pi} \\left( \\frac{K_{Ic,\\text{corr}}}{\\sigma_Y} \\right)^2$$\nNext, we substitute this expression for $a_{\\text{eff}}$ into the definition of $K_{Ic,\\text{corr}}$ to obtain the self-consistent equation:\n$$K_{Ic,\\text{corr}} = Y \\sigma_c \\sqrt{\\pi \\left[ a + \\frac{1}{2\\pi} \\left( \\frac{K_{Ic,\\text{corr}}}{\\sigma_Y} \\right)^2 \\right]}$$\nTo solve for $K_{Ic,\\text{corr}}$, we square both sides:\n$$K_{Ic,\\text{corr}}^2 = (Y \\sigma_c)^2 \\pi \\left[ a + \\frac{1}{2\\pi} \\frac{K_{Ic,\\text{corr}}^2}{\\sigma_Y^2} \\right]$$\nDistributing the terms on the right-hand side gives:\n$$K_{Ic,\\text{corr}}^2 = (Y \\sigma_c)^2 \\pi a + \\frac{(Y \\sigma_c)^2 \\pi}{2\\pi} \\frac{K_{Ic,\\text{corr}}^2}{\\sigma_Y^2}$$\nWe recognize the first term on the right as the square of the uncorrected, linear-elastic fracture toughness, $K_{Ic,\\text{lin}} = Y \\sigma_c \\sqrt{\\pi a}$.\n$$K_{Ic,\\text{corr}}^2 = K_{Ic,\\text{lin}}^2 + \\frac{1}{2} \\left( \\frac{Y \\sigma_c}{\\sigma_Y} \\right)^2 K_{Ic,\\text{corr}}^2$$\nNow, we rearrange the equation to solve for $K_{Ic,\\text{corr}}^2$:\n$$K_{Ic,\\text{corr}}^2 - \\frac{1}{2} \\left( \\frac{Y \\sigma_c}{\\sigma_Y} \\right)^2 K_{Ic,\\text{corr}}^2 = K_{Ic,\\text{lin}}^2$$\n$$K_{Ic,\\text{corr}}^2 \\left[ 1 - \\frac{1}{2} \\left( \\frac{Y \\sigma_c}{\\sigma_Y} \\right)^2 \\right] = K_{Ic,\\text{lin}}^2$$\n$$K_{Ic,\\text{corr}}^2 = \\frac{K_{Ic,\\text{lin}}^2}{1 - \\frac{1}{2} \\left( \\frac{Y \\sigma_c}{\\sigma_Y} \\right)^2}$$\nTaking the square root yields the final expression for the corrected fracture toughness:\n$$K_{Ic,\\text{corr}} = \\frac{K_{Ic,\\text{lin}}}{\\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{2} \\left( \\frac{Y \\sigma_c}{\\sigma_Y} \\right)^2}}$$\n\nThe next task is to evaluate the fractional bias, $\\delta$. Its definition is:\n$$\\delta = \\frac{K_{Ic,\\text{corr}} - K_{Ic,\\text{lin}}}{K_{Ic,\\text{corr}}} = 1 - \\frac{K_{Ic,\\text{lin}}}{K_{Ic,\\text{corr}}}$$\nFrom our derived relationship between $K_{Ic,\\text{corr}}$ and $K_{Ic,\\text{lin}}$, we find the ratio:\n$$\\frac{K_{Ic,\\text{lin}}}{K_{Ic,\\text{corr}}} = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{2} \\left( \\frac{Y \\sigma_c}{\\sigma_Y} \\right)^2}$$\nSubstituting this into the expression for $\\delta$ provides the formula for calculation:\n$$\\delta = 1 - \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{2} \\left( \\frac{Y \\sigma_c}{\\sigma_Y} \\right)^2}$$\nWe now substitute the given numerical values: $Y=1$, $\\sigma_c = 250\\,\\text{MPa}$, and $\\sigma_Y = 350\\,\\text{MPa}$. The crack length $a=10\\,\\text{mm}$ is not needed for the calculation of $\\delta$.\nThe stress ratio is:\n$$\\frac{\\sigma_c}{\\sigma_Y} = \\frac{250}{350} = \\frac{5}{7}$$\nNow we compute $\\delta$:\n$$\\delta = 1 - \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{2} \\left( 1 \\times \\frac{5}{7} \\right)^2}$$\n$$\\delta = 1 - \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{2} \\left( \\frac{25}{49} \\right)}$$\n$$\\delta = 1 - \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{25}{98}}$$\n$$\\delta = 1 - \\sqrt{\\frac{98 - 25}{98}} = 1 - \\sqrt{\\frac{73}{98}}$$\nThe numerical value is calculated:\n$$\\delta \\approx 1 - \\sqrt{0.7448979...}$$\n$$\\delta \\approx 1 - 0.8630747...$$\n$$\\delta \\approx 0.136925...$$\nRounding to three significant figures, the fractional bias is $0.137$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{0.137}\n$$", "id": "2874887"}]}
