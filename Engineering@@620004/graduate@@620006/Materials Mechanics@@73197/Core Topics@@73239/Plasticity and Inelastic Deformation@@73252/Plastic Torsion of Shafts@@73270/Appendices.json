It is a well-posed, scientifically grounded problem in mechanics of materials. A solution will be derived following the specified procedure.\n\n**Derivation of the Fully Plastic Torque**\n\nWe begin from first principles as instructed. The analysis is performed in a cylindrical coordinate system $(r, \\theta, z)$, where the $z$-axis coincides with the tube's axis.\n\nFirst, we verify the admissibility of the proposed stress field. The equilibrium equations in the absence of body forces, $\\nabla \\cdot \\boldsymbol{\\sigma}=\\boldsymbol{0}$, are given in cylindrical coordinates as:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial \\sigma_{rr}}{\\partial r} + \\frac{1}{r} \\frac{\\partial \\tau_{r\\theta}}{\\partial \\theta} + \\frac{\\partial \\tau_{rz}}{\\partial z} + \\frac{\\sigma_{rr} - \\sigma_{\\theta\\theta}}{r} = 0\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial \\tau_{r\\theta}}{\\partial r} + \\frac{1}{r} \\frac{\\partial \\sigma_{\\theta\\theta}}{\\partial \\theta} + \\frac{\\partial \\tau_{\\theta z}}{\\partial z} + \\frac{2 \\tau_{r\\theta}}{r} = 0\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial \\tau_{rz}}{\\partial r} + \\frac{1}{r} \\frac{\\partial \\tau_{\\theta z}}{\\partial \\theta} + \\frac{\\partial \\sigma_{zz}}{\\partial z} + \\frac{\\tau_{rz}}{r} = 0\n$$\n\nThe problem asks to consider a candidate stress field where the only non-zero component is $\\tau_{z\\theta} = \\tau_{\\theta z}$, which depends at most on the radius $r$. Thus, $\\sigma_{rr} = \\sigma_{\\theta\\theta} = \\sigma_{zz} = \\tau_{r\\theta} = \\tau_{rz} = 0$, and $\\tau_{z\\theta} = \\tau_{z\\theta}(r)$. For a problem of pure torsion of a long shaft, we also assume that the stress distribution is independent of the axial coordinate $z$ and, due to axisymmetry, independent of the angular coordinate $\\theta$. Therefore, all derivatives with respect to $z$ and $\\theta$ are zero.\n\nSubstituting this stress field into the equilibrium equations:\n- The first equation ($r$-component) becomes $0+0+0+\\frac{0-0}{r}=0$, which is satisfied identically.\n- The third equation ($z$-component) becomes $0+0+0+0=0$, which is also satisfied identically.\n- The second equation ($\\theta$-component) becomes $0+0+0+0=0$. Note that $\\tau_{r\\theta}=0$ and $\\frac{\\partial \\tau_{\\theta z}}{\\partial z}=0$. This equation is also satisfied for any function $\\tau_{z\\theta}(r)$.\nTherefore, any stress field of the form where $\\tau_{z\\theta}(r)$ is the only non-zero component is in a state of static equilibrium.\n\nNext, we check the boundary conditions. The lateral surfaces at $r=R_{i}$ and $r=R_{o}$ are traction-free. The traction vector on a surface with normal $\\boldsymbol{n}$ is $\\boldsymbol{t} = \\boldsymbol{\\sigma} \\cdot \\boldsymbol{n}$.\n- On the outer surface ($r=R_{o}$), the unit normal vector is $\\boldsymbol{n} = \\boldsymbol{e}_{r}$. The traction components are $t_r = \\sigma_{rr}|_{r=R_o}$, $t_\\theta = \\tau_{r\\theta}|_{r=R_o}$, and $t_z = \\tau_{rz}|_{r=R_o}$. With the chosen stress field, all components are zero. Thus, the traction is zero.\n- On the inner surface ($r=R_{i}$), the unit normal vector is $\\boldsymbol{n} = -\\boldsymbol{e}_{r}$. The traction components are similarly zero.\nThe stress field is therefore statically admissible.\n\nAccording to the lower bound theorem of limit analysis, the collapse torque is the maximum torque that can be supported by any statically admissible stress field that does not violate the yield criterion anywhere. The Tresca yield criterion for a state of pure shear, where the only non-zero stress is $\\tau_{z\\theta}$, is $|\\tau_{z\\theta}| \\leq k$. To maximize the torque, we should choose the stress distribution that saturates this yield condition as much as possible. This leads to the choice:\n$$\n\\tau_{z\\theta}(r) = k \\quad \\text{for} \\quad R_{i} \\leq r \\leq R_{o}\n$$\nThis stress field is statically admissible and satisfies the yield condition everywhere within the material. This corresponds to the fully plastic state.\n\nThe resultant torque $T$ is calculated by integrating the moment produced by the shear stress $\\tau_{z\\theta}$ over the cross-sectional area $A$ of the tube. The differential force on an area element $dA = r \\, dr \\, d\\theta$ is $dF = \\tau_{z\\theta} dA$. The moment of this force about the $z$-axis is $dT = r \\, dF = r (\\tau_{z\\theta} \\, r \\, dr \\, d\\theta)$.\nThe total torque is the integral over the entire cross-section:\n$$\nT = \\iint_A r \\, \\tau_{z\\theta} \\, dA = \\int_{0}^{2\\pi} \\int_{R_i}^{R_o} r \\, \\tau_{z\\theta}(r) \\, (r \\, dr \\, d\\theta) = \\int_{0}^{2\\pi} \\int_{R_i}^{R_o} \\tau_{z\\theta}(r) \\, r^2 \\, dr \\, d\\theta\n$$\nSubstituting the fully plastic stress distribution $\\tau_{z\\theta}(r)=k$ into this expression gives the collapse torque, which we denote as $T_p$:\n$$\nT_p = \\int_{0}^{2\\pi} \\int_{R_i}^{R_o} k \\, r^2 \\, dr \\, d\\theta\n$$\nSince $k$ is a constant, we can move it outside the integrals:\n$$\nT_p = k \\left( \\int_{0}^{2\\pi} d\\theta \\right) \\left( \\int_{R_i}^{R_o} r^2 \\, dr \\right)\n$$\nEvaluating the integrals:\n$$\n\\int_{0}^{2\\pi} d\\theta = 2\\pi\n$$\n$$\n\\int_{R_i}^{R_o} r^2 \\, dr = \\left[ \\frac{r^3}{3} \\right]_{R_i}^{R_o} = \\frac{R_o^3}{3} - \\frac{R_i^3}{3} = \\frac{1}{3} (R_o^3 - R_i^3)\n$$\nCombining these results gives the expression for the fully plastic torque:\n$$\nT_p = k (2\\pi) \\left( \\frac{1}{3} (R_o^3 - R_i^3) \\right)\n$$\nRe-arranging for the final form:\n$$\nT_p = \\frac{2\\pi k}{3} (R_o^3 - R_i^3)\n$$\nIn terms of the given variable names, the expression is:\n$$\nT_p = \\frac{2\\pi k}{3} (R_{o}^{3} - R_{i}^{3})\n$$\nThe units are consistent, with $k$ in Pascals ($\\text{N/m}^2$) and radii in meters ($\\text{m}$), the resulting torque is in Newton-meters ($\\text{N}\\cdot\\text{m}$).", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{2 \\pi k}{3} (R_{o}^{3} - R_{i}^{3})}$$", "id": "2909511"}, {"introduction": "Building on the concept of fully plastic torque, this exercise explores the efficiency of a cross-section's material usage by comparing its performance at the onset of yielding versus its fully plastic state [@problem_id:2909485].

A solution will be derived from first principles as specified.\n\n### Derivation of the Solution\n\n**1. Calculation of the Yield Torque, $T_y$**\n\nAs per the problem statement, we use the elastic torsion theory (Saint-Venant) to find the torque that first causes yielding. For a circular shaft, the shear stress $\\tau$ at a radial distance $r$ from the center is given by:\n$$ \\tau(r) = \\frac{T r}{J} $$\nwhere $T$ is the applied torque and $J$ is the polar moment of inertia of the cross-section.\n\nFor a hollow circular shaft (annulus) with outer radius $R_o$ and inner radius $R_i$, the polar moment of inertia is:\n$$ J = \\int_{R_i}^{R_o} r^2 \\, dA = \\int_{R_i}^{R_o} r^2 (2 \\pi r \\, dr) = 2\\pi \\int_{R_i}^{R_o} r^3 \\, dr = 2\\pi \\left[ \\frac{r^4}{4} \\right]_{R_i}^{R_o} = \\frac{\\pi}{2} (R_o^4 - R_i^4) $$\nThe maximum shear stress occurs at the outermost fiber, where $r = R_o$.\n$$ \\tau_{max} = \\frac{T R_o}{J} $$\nYielding begins when $\\tau_{max}$ reaches the shear yield strength $k$. The torque at which this occurs is defined as $T_y$.\n$$ k = \\frac{T_y R_o}{J} $$\nSolving for $T_y$:\n$$ T_y = \\frac{k J}{R_o} = \\frac{k}{R_o} \\left[ \\frac{\\pi}{2} (R_o^4 - R_i^4) \\right] = \\frac{\\pi k}{2} R_o^3 \\left(1 - \\left(\\frac{R_i}{R_o}\\right)^4\\right) $$\n\n**2. Calculation of the Fully Plastic Torque, $T_p$**\n\nFor a fully plastic state in an ideal rigid-perfectly plastic material, the shear stress throughout the entire yielded cross-section is constant and equal to the shear yield strength, $k$.\n$$ \\tau(r) = k \\quad \\text{for} \\quad R_i \\le r \\le R_o $$\nThe torque is the resultant moment of this stress distribution over the cross-sectional area.\n$$ T_p = \\int_A r \\tau \\, dA = \\int_{R_i}^{R_o} r (k) (2 \\pi r \\, dr) $$\n$$ T_p = 2\\pi k \\int_{R_i}^{R_o} r^2 \\, dr = 2\\pi k \\left[ \\frac{r^3}{3} \\right]_{R_i}^{R_o} = \\frac{2\\pi k}{3} (R_o^3 - R_i^3) $$\nThis can be written as:\n$$ T_p = \\frac{2\\pi k}{3} R_o^3 \\left(1 - \\left(\\frac{R_i}{R_o}\\right)^3\\right) $$\n\n**3. Calculation of the Ratio $T_p/T_y$**\n\nNow we compute the ratio of the fully plastic torque to the yield torque.\n$$ \\frac{T_p}{T_y} = \\frac{\\frac{2\\pi k}{3} (R_o^3 - R_i^3)}{\\frac{\\pi k}{2} (R_o^4 - R_i^4)} = \\frac{2/3}{1/2} \\frac{R_o^3(1 - (R_i/R_o)^3)}{R_o^4(1 - (R_i/R_o)^4)} = \\frac{4}{3} \\frac{1 - (R_i/R_o)^3}{1 - (R_i/R_o)^4} $$\nLet $\\alpha = R_i/R_o$, where $0 \\le \\alpha < 1$.

For a circular annulus, $T_p/T_y=\\dfrac{4}{3}\\dfrac{1-\\left(R_i/R_o\\right)^3}{1-\\left(R_i/R_o\\right)^4}$. Consequently, $T_p/T_y=4/3$ for a solid bar and decreases monotonically to $1$ as $R_i/R_o\\to 1$.**\n\n    The derived formula, $\\frac{T_p}{T_y} = \\frac{4}{3}\\frac{1-(R_i/R_o)^3}{1-(R_i/R_o)^4}$, matches the one given in this option.\n    \n    For a solid bar, $R_i = 0$, so $\\alpha = 0$.\n    $$ \\frac{T_p}{T_y}\\bigg|_{\\alpha=0} = \\frac{4}{3} \\frac{1 - 0^3}{1 - 0^4} = \\frac{4}{3} $$\n    This part is correct.\n    \n    For the limit of a very thin-walled tube, we let $\\alpha \\to 1$. This results in an indeterminate form $0/0$, so we apply L'HÃ´pital's rule to the fraction $\\frac{1-\\alpha^3}{1-\\alpha^4}$.\n    $$ \\lim_{\\alpha \\to 1} \\frac{1 - \\alpha^3}{1 - \\alpha^4} = \\lim_{\\alpha \\to 1} \\frac{\\frac{d}{d\\alpha}(1 - \\alpha^3)}{\\frac{d}{d\\alpha}(1 - \\alpha^4)} = \\lim_{\\alpha \\to 1} \\frac{-3\\alpha^2}{-4\\alpha^3} = \\frac{-3(1)^2}{-4(1)^3} = \\frac{3}{4} $$\n    Therefore, the limit of the ratio is:\n    $$ \\lim_{\\alpha \\to 1} \\frac{T_p}{T_y} = \\frac{4}{3} \\cdot \\frac{3}{4} = 1 $$\n    This part is also correct.\n    \n    Finally, we check for monotonic decrease. We examine the derivative of $\\eta_p(\\alpha) = \\frac{4}{3} \\frac{1 - \\alpha^3}{1 - \\alpha^4}$ with respect to $\\alpha$ for $\\alpha \\in [0, 1)$.\n    $$ \\frac{d\\eta_p}{d\\alpha} = \\frac{4}{3} \\frac{(-3\\alpha^2)(1-\\alpha^4) - (1-\\alpha^3)(-4\\alpha^3)}{(1-\\alpha^4)^2} = \\frac{4}{3} \\frac{-3\\alpha^2+3\\alpha^6 + 4\\alpha^3-4\\alpha^6}{(1-\\alpha^4)^2} = \\frac{4}{3} \\frac{\\alpha^2(4\\alpha - 3 - \\alpha^4)}{(1-\\alpha^4)^2} $$\n    The sign is determined by the term $h(\\alpha) = 4\\alpha - 3 - \\alpha^4$.\n    At $\\alpha=0$, $h(0) = -3$. At $\\alpha=1$, $h(1) = 4-3-1=0$.\n    The derivative of $h(\\alpha)$ is $h'(\\alpha) = 4 - 4\\alpha^3 = 4(1-\\alpha^3)$. For $\\alpha \\in [0, 1)$, $h'(\\alpha) > 0$.\n    Since $h(\\alpha)$ increases strictly from $-3$ to $0$ on the interval $[0, 1]$, we have $h(\\alpha) < 0$ for all $\\alpha \\in [0, 1)$. Thus, $\\frac{d\\eta_p}{d\\alpha} < 0$ for $\\alpha \\in (0, 1)$, meaning the ratio decreases monotonically.\n    \n    All claims in this statement are correct.\n    Verdict: **Correct**.\n\n- **B. The ratio $T_p/T_y$ is independent of geometry for circular shafts and equals $4/3$ for both solid and thin-walled tubes.**\n    \n    The derived ratio $\\frac{T_p}{T_y} = \\frac{4}{3} \\frac{1 - \\alpha^3}{1 - \\alpha^4}$ clearly depends on the geometric parameter $\\alpha = R_i/R_o$. Thus, it is not independent of geometry. While it equals $4/3$ for a solid shaft ($\\alpha=0$), it equals $1$ for a thin-walled tube ($\\alpha \\to 1$). The statement is factually incorrect.\n    Verdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n- **C. The ratio $T_p/T_y$ increases with $R_i/R_o$ and approaches $4/3$ for very thin walls.**\n\n    Our analysis for option A showed that the ratio *decreases* monotonically as $R_i/R_o$ increases. Furthermore, the limit for very thin walls ($R_i/R_o \\to 1$) is $1$, not $4/3$. This statement makes two incorrect claims.\n    Verdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n- **D. For a thin-walled tube, $T_p/T_y<1$, since the torque to reach fully plastic state is lower than the torque to first yield.**\n\n    The analysis shows that the ratio $T_p/T_y$ decreases from $4/3$ to $1$. It is always greater than or equal to $1$. Physically, the torque required to cause yielding across the entire cross-section ($T_p$) cannot be less than the torque required to initiate yielding at a single point ($T_y$). The condition $T_p \\ge T_y$ must always hold, which implies $T_p/T_y \\ge 1$. The statement is physically and mathematically incorrect.\n    Verdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n- **E. For a circular annulus, $T_p/T_y=\\dfrac{4}{3}\\dfrac{1-\\left(R_i/R_o\\right)^4}{1-\\left(R_i/R_o\\right)^3}$, which increases with $R_i/R_o$ and exceeds $4/3$ in the thin-wall limit.**\n\n    The formula presented is the inverse of the correct expression derived earlier. It has the terms with exponents $4$ and $3$ interchanged between the numerator and denominator. This formula is incorrect. Consequently, the claims about its behavior (increasing function, limit exceeding $4/3$) are based on a false premise and are also incorrect.\n    Verdict: **Incorrect**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2909485"}, {"introduction": "This final practice synthesizes the concepts of elasticity, plasticity, and hardening into a complete boundary value problem [@problem_id:2909451].

All principles and equations provided are standard and fundamentally sound. This is a canonical problem in solid mechanics.\n- **Well-Posedness**: The problem defines a complete boundary value problem. Given the geometry, monotonic loading history, and a well-behaved constitutive law, a unique stress and strain field exists for any given end twist $\\Phi$. The computation of the torque is a direct consequence of this solution.\n- **Objectivity**: The problem is stated using precise, unambiguous scientific language. All quantities are clearly defined.\n- **Completeness and Consistency**: The problem provides all necessary information, including geometric parameters, material constants, governing equations, kinematic relations, and equilibrium conditions. The numerical test cases are fully specified and consistent with the physical model. No contradictions or missing information are present.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\n\nThe problem is **valid**. It is a scientifically sound, well-posed, and complete problem statement. I will proceed with the derivation and solution.\n\n**Derivation of the Torque-Twist Relation**\n\nThe task is to derive the total torque $T$ as a function of the applied twist per unit length $\\kappa = \\Phi/L$. This requires determining the shear stress distribution $\\tau(r)$ across the radius of the shaft.\n\nFirst, we must establish the local constitutive relationship between shear stress $\\tau$ and shear strain $\\gamma$ under monotonic loading.\nThe only non-zero stress component is $\\tau$. The von Mises equivalent stress is $\\sigma_{\\text{eq}} = \\sqrt{3}|\\tau|$. For monotonic loading starting from zero, we assume $\\tau \\ge 0$. The yield function is $f = \\sqrt{3}\\tau - (\\sigma_{y0} + H \\varepsilon_p^{\\text{eq}})$.\nThe material is elastic as long as $f < 0$, i.e., $\\sqrt{3}\\tau < \\sigma_{y0}$. The initial shear yield stress is thus $\\tau_y = \\sigma_{y0} / \\sqrt{3}$. In the elastic regime, the stress-strain relation is $\\tau = G\\gamma$. Yielding begins when the shear strain reaches the yield strain $\\gamma_y = \\tau_y/G = \\sigma_{y0}/(\\sqrt{3}G)$.\n\nFor post-yield behavior ($\\gamma > \\gamma_y$), the material is in the plastic state, and the yield condition $f=0$ is satisfied. For monotonic loading, the relation $d\\varepsilon_p^{\\text{eq}} = d\\gamma_p/\\sqrt{3}$ can be integrated to $\\varepsilon_p^{\\text{eq}} = \\gamma_p/\\sqrt{3}$.\nSubstituting this into the yield condition:\n$$ \\sqrt{3}\\tau = \\sigma_{y0} + H \\frac{\\gamma_p}{\\sqrt{3}} \\quad \\implies \\quad 3\\tau = \\sqrt{3}\\sigma_{y0} + H\\gamma_p $$\nUsing the additive strain decomposition $\\gamma_p = \\gamma - \\gamma_e = \\gamma - \\tau/G$, we can express $\\tau$ as a function of the total strain $\\gamma$:\n$$ 3\\tau = \\sqrt{3}\\sigma_{y0} + H(\\gamma - \\tau/G) $$\n$$ \\tau(3 + H/G) = \\sqrt{3}\\sigma_{y0} + H\\gamma $$\n$$ \\tau\\left(\\frac{3G+H}{G}\\right) = \\sqrt{3}\\sigma_{y0} + H\\gamma $$\nThis can be rewritten using a tangent shear modulus, $G_T$. From the rate form, $d\\gamma = d\\gamma_e + d\\gamma_p = d\\tau/G + 3d\\tau/H = d\\tau(1/G + 3/H)$.\nThe tangent modulus in the plastic range is $G_T = d\\tau/d\\gamma = (1/G + 3/H)^{-1} = \\frac{GH}{H+3G}$.\nThe stress-strain relation for $\\gamma \\ge \\gamma_y$ is then given by $\\tau - \\tau_y = G_T(\\gamma - \\gamma_y)$.\n\nThus, the complete stress-strain response is piecewise:\n$$\n\\tau(\\gamma) =\n\\begin{cases}\nG\\gamma, & \\text{if } \\gamma \\le \\gamma_y \\\\\n\\tau_y + G_T(\\gamma - \\gamma_y), & \\text{if } \\gamma > \\gamma_y\n\\end{cases}\n$$\nwhere $\\tau_y = \\sigma_{y0}/\\sqrt{3}$, $\\gamma_y = \\tau_y/G$, and $G_T = GH/(H+3G)$.\n\nNow, we analyze the shaft. The shear strain varies linearly with the radius, $\\gamma(r) = \\kappa r$.\nThe twist per unit length at which yielding initiates at the outer radius $r=R$ is $\\kappa_y = \\gamma_y/R = \\sigma_{y0}/(\\sqrt{3}GR)$.\n\nCase 1: Fully elastic shaft ($\\kappa \\le \\kappa_y$)\nIf the applied twist $\\kappa$ is less than or equal to $\\kappa_y$, the entire cross-section remains elastic. The stress at any radius $r$ is $\\tau(r) = G\\gamma(r) = G\\kappa r$.\nThe torque is found by integrating this stress distribution:\n$$ T = 2\\pi \\int_0^R (G\\kappa r) r^2 \\, dr = 2\\pi G\\kappa \\int_0^R r^3 \\, dr = 2\\pi G\\kappa \\frac{R^4}{4} = \\frac{\\pi}{2} G\\kappa R^4 $$\nThis is the standard formula for elastic torsion, where $J = \\pi R^4/2$ is the polar moment of inertia.\n\nCase 2: Partially plastic shaft ($\\kappa > \\kappa_y$)\nIf $\\kappa > \\kappa_y$, the outer portion of the shaft yields. An elastic core of radius $r_y$ exists, where the strain is below $\\gamma_y$. At the boundary $r=r_y$, the strain is exactly the yield strain:\n$$ \\gamma(r_y) = \\kappa r_y = \\gamma_y \\quad \\implies \\quad r_y = \\frac{\\gamma_y}{\\kappa} = \\frac{\\kappa_y R}{\\kappa} $$\nThe stress distribution is now piecewise:\n- Elastic core ($0 \\le r \\le r_y$): $\\tau(r) = G\\gamma(r) = G\\kappa r$.\n- Plastic annulus ($r_y < r \\le R$): $\\tau(r) = \\tau_y + G_T(\\gamma(r) - \\gamma_y) = \\tau_y + G_T(\\kappa r - \\gamma_y)$.\n\nThe total torque is the sum of the contributions from the elastic core and the plastic annulus:\n$$ T = \\int_0^{r_y} 2\\pi r^2 (G\\kappa r) \\, dr + \\int_{r_y}^R 2\\pi r^2 (\\tau_y + G_T(\\kappa r - \\gamma_y)) \\, dr $$\nThe first integral is the torque on the elastic core, $T_{\\text{core}} = \\frac{\\pi}{2}G\\kappa r_y^4$.\nThe second integral is the torque on the annulus, $T_{\\text{annulus}}$. We expand the integrand:\n$$ T_{\\text{annulus}} = 2\\pi \\int_{r_y}^R ( (\\tau_y - G_T\\gamma_y) r^2 + G_T\\kappa r^3 ) \\, dr $$\n$$ T_{\\text{annulus}} = 2\\pi \\left[ (\\tau_y - G_T\\gamma_y) \\frac{r^3}{3} + G_T\\kappa \\frac{r^4}{4} \\right]_{r_y}^R $$\n$$ T_{\\text{annulus}} = \\frac{2\\pi}{3}(\\tau_y - G_T\\gamma_y)(R^3 - r_y^3) + \\frac{\\pi}{2}G_T\\kappa(R^4 - r_y^4) $$\nThe total torque is $T = T_{\\text{core}} + T_{\\text{annulus}}$. Substituting $T_{\\text{core}}$:\n$$ T = \\frac{\\pi}{2}G\\kappa r_y^4 + \\frac{2\\pi}{3}(\\tau_y - G_T\\gamma_y)(R^3 - r_y^3) + \\frac{\\pi}{2}G_T\\kappa(R^4 - r_y^4) $$\nUsing $\\tau_y = G\\gamma_y$ and combining terms:\n$$ T = \\frac{\\pi}{2}\\kappa(G_T R^4 + (G-G_T)r_y^4) + \\frac{2\\pi}{3}(G\\gamma_y - G_T\\gamma_y)(R^3 - r_y^3) $$\n$$ T = \\frac{\\pi\\kappa}{2}(G_T R^4 + (G-G_T)r_y^4) + \\frac{2\\pi\\gamma_y}{3}(G-G_T)(R^3 - r_y^3) $$\nThis expression is correct and can be used for computation.\n\nSpecial case: Elastic-perfectly plastic ($H=0$)\nWhen $H=0$, the tangent modulus $G_T=0$. The stress in the plastic annulus ($r>r_y$) becomes constant, $\\tau(r) = \\tau_y$.\nThe torque expression simplifies to:\n$$ T = \\int_0^{r_y} 2\\pi r^2 (G\\kappa r) \\, dr + \\int_{r_y}^R 2\\pi r^2 (\\tau_y) \\, dr $$\n$$ T = \\frac{\\pi}{2}G\\kappa r_y^4 + \\frac{2\\pi}{3}\\tau_y(R^3-r_y^3) $$\nUsing the relation $G\\kappa r_y = \\tau_y$, which implies $G\\kappa = \\tau_y/r_y$:\n$$ T = \\frac{\\pi}{2}\\frac{\\tau_y}{r_y}r_y^4 + \\frac{2\\pi}{3}\\tau_y(R^3-r_y^3) = \\frac{\\pi}{2}\\tau_y r_y^3 + \\frac{2\\pi}{3}\\tau_y R^3 - \\frac{2\\pi}{3}\\tau_y r_y^3 $$\n$$ T = \\frac{2\\pi}{3}\\tau_y R^3 - \\frac{\\pi}{6}\\tau_y r_y^3 = \\frac{2\\pi \\tau_y R^3}{3} \\left( 1 - \\frac{1}{4} \\left(\\frac{r_y}{R}\\right)^3 \\right) $$\nThis is the classical result for elastic-perfectly plastic torsion.
