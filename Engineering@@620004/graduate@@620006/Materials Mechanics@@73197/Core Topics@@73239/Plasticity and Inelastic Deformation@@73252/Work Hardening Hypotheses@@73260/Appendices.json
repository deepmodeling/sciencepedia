Its premises are grounded in established physical models—namely, the Peach-Koehler force, the line tension approximation for a dislocation, and the Orowan mechanism for obstacle bypass. The problem is well-posed, objective, and internally consistent. It is therefore valid for rigorous analysis.\n\nPart (a): Derivation of Critical Shear Stress and Obstacle Strength Condition\n\nThe fundamental postulate for the equilibrium of a flexible dislocation line under an applied resolved shear stress $\\tau$ is the balance between the external driving force and the internal restoring force from the line tension $T$. The driving force per unit length is the Peach-Koehler force, given as $\\tau b$. The restoring force per unit length due to the line's curvature $\\kappa$ is $T \\kappa$. The force balance equation is thus:\n$$T \\kappa = \\tau b$$\nThe problem states that for a dislocation segment pinned between two obstacles separated by a distance $L$, the critical configuration for bypass corresponds to the segment bowing out into a semicircle. The diameter of this semicircle is the inter-obstacle distance $L$. Therefore, the radius of curvature at this critical point is $R_c = \\frac{L}{2}$.\n\nThe curvature $\\kappa$ is the reciprocal of the radius of curvature $R$. At the critical condition, the curvature $\\kappa_c$ is:\n$$\\kappa_c = \\frac{1}{R_c} = \\frac{1}{L/2} = \\frac{2}{L}$$\nSubstituting this critical curvature into the force balance equation allows us to find the critical shear stress, $\\tau_c$, required to achieve this configuration:\n$$T \\kappa_c = \\tau_c b$$\n$$T \\left(\\frac{2}{L}\\right) = \\tau_c b$$\nSolving for $\\tau_c$, we obtain the expression for the Orowan bowing stress:\n$$\\tau_c = \\frac{2T}{bL}$$\nThis result is valid under the assumption that the obstacles are \"strong,\" meaning they are not cut or overcome by the dislocation before it can complete the bypass maneuver. This requires that the force exerted by the dislocation line on each pinning point does not exceed the obstacle's intrinsic strength, $f$.\n\nIn the line tension model, the tension $T$ acts tangentially along the dislocation line. At the critical semicircular configuration, the dislocation line is perpendicular to the chord of length $L$ at the pinning points. The force exerted by the dislocation line on each obstacle is a direct pull with magnitude equal to the line tension, $T$. Therefore, for the Orowan bypass mechanism to be the controlling process, the obstacle strength $f$ must be sufficient to withstand this force. The condition for bowing-controlled bypass is:\n$$f \\ge T$$\nIf this condition is not met (i.e., $f < T$), the dislocation will detach from the obstacles prematurely at a stress below $\\tau_c$, a process known as weak pinning or obstacle cutting.\n\nPart (b): Derivation of the Taylor Hardening Coefficient $\\alpha$\n\nWe now seek to express the critical stress $\\tau_c$ in a form consistent with the empirical Taylor hardening law, which relates the flow stress to the square root of the dislocation density $\\rho$. We begin with the result from part (a):\n$$\\tau_c = \\frac{2T}{bL}$$\nThe problem provides a scaling law relating the mean obstacle spacing $L$ to the forest dislocation density $\\rho$:\n$$L = \\xi \\rho^{-1/2}$$\nwhere $\\xi$ is a dimensionless geometric factor. Substituting this expression for $L$ into the equation for $\\tau_c$:\n$$\\tau_c = \\frac{2T}{b (\\xi \\rho^{-1/2})} = \\frac{2T}{b \\xi} \\rho^{1/2}$$\nThis expression now shows the characteristic $\\sqrt{\\rho}$ dependence of Taylor hardening. We are asked to equate this to the generalized form:\n$$\\tau_c = \\alpha G b \\sqrt{\\rho}$$\nwhere $G$ is the shear modulus and $\\alpha$ is the dimensionless Taylor-type coefficient we must determine.\n\nBy comparing the two expressions for $\\tau_c$, we can identify the terms that constitute $\\alpha$:\n$$\\alpha G b \\sqrt{\\rho} = \\left( \\frac{2T}{b \\xi} \\right) \\sqrt{\\rho}$$\nAssuming a non-zero dislocation density ($\\rho \\neq 0$), we can divide both sides by $\\sqrt{\\rho}$:\n$$\\alpha G b = \\frac{2T}{b \\xi}$$\nFinally, we solve for the coefficient $\\alpha$ by isolating it:\n$$\\alpha = \\frac{2T}{G b^2 \\xi}$$\nThis expression for $\\alpha$ depends on the fundamental material properties of line tension ($T$), shear modulus ($G$), and Burgers vector ($b$), as well as the statistical geometric factor $\\xi$ of the dislocation network. The expression is dimensionless, as required, which can be verified by noting that line tension $T$ has units of force (or energy/length) while $G b^2$ also has units of force ($[F/L^2] \\cdot [L^2] = [F]$).", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{2T}{G b^{2} \\xi}}$$", "id": "2930023"}, {"introduction": "While the Taylor relation provides a static link between stress and dislocation density, the internal structure of real materials evolves during deformation.

To solve it, we introduce the substitution $u(\\varepsilon) = \\sqrt{\\rho(\\varepsilon)}$. From this, we have $\\rho = u^2$ and, by differentiation with respect to $\\varepsilon$, $\\frac{d\\rho}{d\\varepsilon} = 2u \\frac{du}{d\\varepsilon}$. Substituting these into the original equation:\n$$\n2u \\frac{du}{d\\varepsilon} = k_{1}u - k_{2}u^2\n$$\nFor a physically meaningful situation, $\\rho>0$, which implies $u>0$. We can divide by $2u$:\n$$\n\\frac{du}{d\\varepsilon} = \\frac{k_1}{2} - \\frac{k_2}{2}u\n$$\nThis is a first-order linear inhomogeneous ordinary differential equation, which can be rearranged as:\n$$\n\\frac{du}{d\\varepsilon} + \\frac{k_2}{2}u = \\frac{k_1}{2}\n$$\nThe integrating factor is $I(\\varepsilon) = \\exp\\left(\\int \\frac{k_2}{2} d\\varepsilon\\right) = \\exp\\left(\\frac{k_2}{2}\\varepsilon\\right)$.

The response is initially elastic. Plastic flow will resume when the stress state again satisfies the yield condition, $ |\\sigma - \\alpha| = \\sigma_{y0} + R $. The internal variables are frozen at $ \\alpha_1 $ and $ R_1 $. Since $ \\sigma < 0 $ and $ \\alpha_1 > 0 $, the term $ \\sigma - \\alpha_1 $ is negative. Thus, reverse yielding occurs when:\n$$ -(\\sigma - \\alpha_{1}) = \\sigma_{y0} + R_{1} $$\nThe stress at which this occurs is the reverse yield stress, $ \\sigma_{y,\\mathrm{rev}} $:\n$$ \\sigma_{y,\\mathrm{rev}} = \\alpha_{1} - (\\sigma_{y0} + R_{1}) = (C - H_{\\mathrm{iso}}) \\varepsilon_{p1} - \\sigma_{y0} $$\nWe now substitute the expressions for the parameters and for $ \\varepsilon_{p1} $:\n$$ \\sigma_{y,\\mathrm{rev}} = (3.0 \\times 10^3 - 1.0 \\times 10^3) \\times \\frac{2850}{214000} - 300 = (2.0 \\times 10^3) \\times \\frac{2850}{214000} - 300 $$\n$$ \\sigma_{y,\\mathrm{rev}} = \\frac{5700000}{214000} - 300 = \\frac{5700}{214} - 300 = \\frac{2850}{107} - 300 \\approx 26.6355 - 300 = -273.3645 \\,\\mathrm{MPa} $$\n\nCalculation of the Bauschinger Reduction Factor\nThe Bauschinger reduction factor $ B $ is defined as:\n$$ B \\equiv \\frac{\\sigma_{y0} - |\\sigma_{y,\\mathrm{rev}}|}{\\sigma_{y0}} $$\nThe magnitude of the reverse yield stress is $ |\\sigma_{y,\\mathrm{rev}}| \\approx |-273.3645| = 273.3645 \\,\\mathrm{MPa} $.\n$$ B = \\frac{300 - 273.3645}{300} = \\frac{26.6355}{300} \\approx 0.088785 $$\nAlternatively, we can derive a symbolic expression for $ B $. Since $ (C - H_{\\mathrm{iso}}) \\varepsilon_{p1} < \\sigma_{y0} $, we have $ |\\sigma_{y,\\mathrm{rev}}| = \\sigma_{y0} - (C - H_{\\mathrm{iso}}) \\varepsilon_{p1} $. Substituting this into the definition of $ B $:\n$$ B = \\frac{\\sigma_{y0} - (\\sigma_{y0} - (C - H_{\\mathrm{iso}}) \\varepsilon_{p1})}{\\sigma_{y0}} = \\frac{(C - H_{\\mathrm{iso}}) \\varepsilon_{p1}}{\\sigma_{y0}} $$\nWe calculate $ B $ using this simplified expression:\n$$ B = \\frac{(3.0 \\times 10^3 - 1.0 \\times 10^3) \\,\\mathrm{MPa}}{300 \\,\\mathrm{MPa}} \\times \\left( \\frac{2850}{214000} \\right) = \\frac{2000}{300} \\times \\frac{2850}{214000} = \\frac{20}{3} \\times \\frac{2850}{214000} = \\frac{57000}{642000} = \\frac{57}{642} $$\nThe numerical value is:\n$$ B = \\frac{57}{642} \\approx 0.0887850467... $$\nRounding to four significant figures as required by the problem statement, we obtain the final answer.\n$$ B \\approx 0.08879 $$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.08879}$$", "id": "2930115"}]}
