A rigorous solution will be developed from the specified first principles.\n\nWe begin by establishing the constitutive framework.\nThe total strain $\\varepsilon$ is the sum of the elastic strain $\\varepsilon^e$ and the plastic strain $\\varepsilon^p$:\n$$ \\varepsilon = \\varepsilon^e + \\varepsilon^p $$\nIn rate (or incremental) form, this is:\n$$ d\\varepsilon = d\\varepsilon^e + d\\varepsilon^p $$\nThe stress $\\sigma$ is related to the elastic strain by Hooke's law:\n$$ \\sigma = E \\varepsilon^e \\implies d\\sigma = E d\\varepsilon^e $$\nThe yield condition for uniaxial tension with linear isotropic hardening states that plastic flow occurs when the stress $\\sigma$ reaches the current yield strength $\\sigma_Y$. The yield strength evolves from its initial value $\\sigma_y$ as a function of the accumulated plastic strain, which in this uniaxial case is simply $\\varepsilon^p$. The yield function $f$ is given by:\n$$ f(\\sigma, \\varepsilon^p) = |\\sigma| - \\sigma_Y = 0 $$\nwhere $\\sigma_Y = \\sigma_y + H\\varepsilon^p$. For monotonic tension, $\\sigma > 0$, so we write:\n$$ f(\\sigma, \\varepsilon^p) = \\sigma - (\\sigma_y + H\\varepsilon^p) = 0 $$\nDuring plastic loading, the state must remain on the yield surface, which implies the consistency condition $df = 0$:\n$$ df = \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial \\sigma} d\\sigma + \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial \\varepsilon^p} d\\varepsilon^p = 0 $$\nFrom the yield function, we compute the partial derivatives:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial \\sigma} = 1 $$\n$$ \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial \\varepsilon^p} = -H $$\nSubstituting these into the consistency condition gives:\n$$ d\\sigma - H d\\varepsilon^p = 0 \\implies d\\varepsilon^p = \\frac{d\\sigma}{H} $$\nThis result is consistent with the associative flow rule, where the plastic strain increment is normal to the yield surface, $d\\varepsilon^p = d\\lambda \\, \\partial f / \\partial \\sigma = d\\lambda$, making the plastic multiplier increment $d\\lambda = d\\sigma/H$.\n\nNow, we derive the elastoplastic tangent modulus, $E^{ep} = d\\sigma/d\\varepsilon$. We combine the incremental relations:\n$$ d\\varepsilon = d\\varepsilon^e + d\\varepsilon^p $$\nSubstitute $d\\varepsilon^e = d\\sigma/E$ and $d\\varepsilon^p = d\\sigma/H$:\n$$ d\\varepsilon = \\frac{d\\sigma}{E} + \\frac{d\\sigma}{H} = d\\sigma \\left( \\frac{1}{E} + \\frac{1}{H} \\right) = d\\sigma \\left( \\frac{E+H}{EH} \\right) $$\nSolving for the ratio $d\\sigma/d\\varepsilon$:\n$$ E^{ep} = \\frac{d\\sigma}{d\\varepsilon} = \\left( \\frac{E+H}{EH} \\right)^{-1} = \\frac{EH}{E+H} $$\nThis is the expression for the uniaxial elastoplastic tangent modulus.

The stress-strain relation in this regime is linear with slope $E^{ep}$. The equation of this line, starting from the point $(\\varepsilon_y, \\sigma_y)$, is:\n$$ \\sigma = \\sigma_y + E^{ep} (\\varepsilon - \\varepsilon_y) $$\nWe use consistent units of GPa for moduli and stress. Thus, $\\sigma_y = 0.3$ GPa, $E = 210$ GPa, $H = 1$ GPa.\nFirst, compute $E^{ep}$:\n$$ E^{ep} = \\frac{(210)(1)}{210+1} = \\frac{210}{211} \\text{ GPa} $$\nNow compute the stress $\\sigma$ at $\\varepsilon = 0.005$:\n$$ \\sigma = 0.3 + \\frac{210}{211} \\left( 0.005 - \\frac{1}{700} \\right) = 0.3 + \\frac{210}{211} \\left( \\frac{5}{1000} - \\frac{1}{700} \\right) $$\n$$ \\sigma = 0.3 + \\frac{210}{211} \\left( \\frac{35 - 10}{7000} \\right) = 0.3 + \\frac{210}{211} \\left( \\frac{25}{7000} \\right) = 0.3 + \\frac{5250}{1477000} $$\nTo avoid intermediate rounding, we proceed symbolically:\n$$ \\sigma = \\sigma_y + \\frac{EH}{E+H} \\left( \\varepsilon - \\frac{\\sigma_y}{E} \\right) = \\frac{\\sigma_y(E+H) + EH\\varepsilon - H\\sigma_y}{E+H} = \\frac{E\\sigma_y + EH\\varepsilon}{E+H} = \\frac{E(\\sigma_y + H\\varepsilon)}{E+H} $$\nSubstituting numerical values:\n$$ \\sigma = \\frac{210 (0.3 + 1 \\times 0.005)}{210+1} = \\frac{210(0.305)}{211} = \\frac{64.05}{211} \\text{ GPa} $$\n$$ \\sigma \\approx 0.3035545 \\text{ GPa} $$\nThe secant modulus $E^{sec}$ is defined as $\\sigma/\\varepsilon$:\n$$ E^{sec} = \\frac{\\sigma}{\\varepsilon} = \\frac{64.05/211}{0.005} = \\frac{64.05}{211 \\times 0.005} = \\frac{64.05}{1.055} \\text{ GPa} $$\n$$ E^{sec} \\approx 60.7109 \\text{ GPa} $$\nThe values for the final answer rounded to four significant figures are:\n- $E^{ep} = \\frac{210}{211} \\text{ GPa} \\approx 0.99526 \\text{ GPa} \\to 0.9953 \\text{ GPa}$.\n- $E^{sec} \\approx 60.7109 \\text{ GPa} \\to 60.71 \\text{ GPa}$.\n\nFinally, we address which modulus better predicts the next small stress increment.\nThe incremental constitutive relation for continued plastic loading is, by definition, $d\\sigma = E^{ep} d\\varepsilon$. For small but finite increments $\\Delta\\varepsilon$, this provides the first-order approximation $\\Delta\\sigma \\approx E^{ep} \\Delta\\varepsilon$. The elastoplastic tangent modulus $E^{ep}$ is the derivative of the stress-strain curve, $\\sigma(\\varepsilon)$, at the current state. It therefore represents the instantaneous stiffness of the material at that point.\nThe secant modulus, $E^{sec} = \\sigma/\\varepsilon$, represents the slope of a line from the origin $(0,0)$ to the current point $(\\varepsilon, \\sigma)$ on the stress-strain curve. It is an average stiffness over the entire strain history from the initial state.\nThe stress-strain curve is non-linear (in fact, bi-linear). Using the secant modulus to predict a stress increment, $\\Delta\\sigma_{pred} = E^{sec} \\Delta\\varepsilon$, would be equivalent to approximating the curve locally by a line passing through the origin. Since plastic deformation has significantly reduced the material's stiffness, $E^{ep} \\ll E^{sec} < E$. Consequently, the secant modulus would grossly overestimate the stress increment corresponding to a further small strain increment.\nTherefore, from first principles—the definition of a derivative as a local linear approximation—the elastoplastic tangent modulus $E^{ep}$ is the correct and superior predictor for the incremental stress response under continued plastic loading.\n\nThe final requested numerical values are $E^{sec} = 60.71$ GPa and $E^{ep} = 0.9953$ GPa.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n60.71 & 0.9953\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "2883001"}, {"introduction": "Building on the linear model, this exercise introduces a more realistic non-linear hardening law known as Voce hardening, which describes the saturation of yield stress at large strains.

The plastic strain rate is given by an associative flow rule:\n$$\n\\dot{\\varepsilon}^p = \\dot{\\lambda} \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial \\sigma} = \\dot{\\lambda} \\, \\mathrm{sgn}(\\sigma-\\alpha)\n$$\nwhere $\\dot{\\lambda} \\ge 0$ is the plastic multiplier. The evolution of the backstress is governed by the linear kinematic hardening rule:\n$$\n\\dot{\\alpha} = H' \\dot{\\varepsilon}^p\n$$\nwhere $H'$ is the constant kinematic hardening modulus. The loading/unloading conditions (Kuhn-Tucker conditions) are $\\dot{\\lambda} \\ge 0$, $f \\le 0$, and $\\dot{\\lambda} f = 0$. When plastic flow is active, the stress state must remain on the yield surface, which imposes the consistency condition, $\\dot{f} = 0$.\n\n### Tangent Modulus for Unloading ($D_{\\mathrm{unload}}$)\nThe problem describes a state where the material has been loaded plastically in tension and the strain direction is then reversed. At the point of reversal, the stress state $(\\sigma, \\alpha)$ lies on the yield surface, satisfying $f(\\sigma, \\alpha) = 0$. An infinitesimal strain increment in the reverse direction ($\\dot{\\varepsilon} < 0$) causes the stress to decrease, moving the stress state into the interior of the yield surface ($f < 0$). According to the Kuhn-Tucker conditions, this means there is no plastic flow, so the plastic multiplier $\\dot{\\lambda}$ must be zero.\nWith $\\dot{\\lambda} = 0$, the plastic strain rate is zero:\n$$\n\\dot{\\varepsilon}^p = 0\n$$\nThe strain rate decomposition then simplifies to:\n$$\n\\dot{\\varepsilon} = \\dot{\\varepsilon}^e\n$$\nSubstituting this into Hooke's law gives the relationship between the total strain rate and the stress rate:\n$$\n\\dot{\\sigma} = E \\dot{\\varepsilon}^e = E \\dot{\\varepsilon}\n$$\nThe tangent modulus is defined as the coefficient relating the strain rate to the stress rate, $D = \\frac{\\dot{\\sigma}}{\\dot{\\varepsilon}}$. Therefore, the tangent modulus for immediate unloading is the Young's modulus:\n$$\nD_{\\mathrm{unload}} = E\n$$\nThis response is purely elastic.\n\n### Tangent Modulus for Reverse Plastic Flow ($E^{ep}_{\\mathrm{reload}}$)\nAfter the initial elastic unloading, the stress continues to decrease until it reaches the yield surface on the opposite side. At this point, reverse plastic flow initiates. Let us assume the initial loading was in tension, so at the point of reversal, $\\sigma > \\alpha$. For reverse loading, the stress becomes compressive relative to the backstress, i.e., $\\sigma < \\alpha$. Thus, $\\mathrm{sgn}(\\sigma-\\alpha) = -1$.\nThe yield function during reverse plastic flow is:\n$$\nf(\\sigma, \\alpha) = -(\\sigma - \\alpha) - \\sigma_{y0} = 0\n$$\nThe associative flow rule gives:\n$$\n\\dot{\\varepsilon}^p = \\dot{\\lambda} \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial \\sigma} = \\dot{\\lambda}(-1) = -\\dot{\\lambda}\n$$\nThe hardening rule becomes:\n$$\n\\dot{\\alpha} = H' \\dot{\\varepsilon}^p = -H' \\dot{\\lambda}\n$$\nDuring active plastic flow, the consistency condition $\\dot{f}=0$ must hold:\n$$\n\\dot{f} = \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial \\sigma}\\dot{\\sigma} + \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial \\alpha}\\dot{\\alpha} = 0\n$$\nThe partial derivatives are $\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial \\sigma} = -1$ and $\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial \\alpha} = 1$. The consistency condition is therefore:\n$$\n(-1)\\dot{\\sigma} + (1)\\dot{\\alpha} = 0 \\implies \\dot{\\sigma} = \\dot{\\alpha}\n$$\nSubstituting the hardening rule, we find a relation for the stress rate in terms of the plastic multiplier:\n$$\n\\dot{\\sigma} = -H' \\dot{\\lambda} \\implies \\dot{\\lambda} = -\\frac{\\dot{\\sigma}}{H'}\n$$\nNote that since $\\dot{\\sigma}$ will be negative during compressive loading and $H' > 0$, we have $\\dot{\\lambda} > 0$ as required.\n\nNow, we combine these relations. The stress rate is given by Hooke's law applied to the elastic part of the strain:\n$$\n\\dot{\\sigma} = E \\dot{\\varepsilon}^e = E(\\dot{\\varepsilon} - \\dot{\\varepsilon}^p)\n$$\nSubstituting $\\dot{\\varepsilon}^p = -\\dot{\\lambda}$ gives:\n$$\n\\dot{\\sigma} = E(\\dot{\\varepsilon} + \\dot{\\lambda})\n$$\nNow substitute the expression for $\\dot{\\lambda}$ from the consistency condition:\n$$\n\\dot{\\sigma} = E\\left(\\dot{\\varepsilon} - \\frac{\\dot{\\sigma}}{H'}\\right)\n$$\nWe now solve for $\\dot{\\sigma}$ in terms of $\\dot{\\varepsilon}$:\n$$\n\\dot{\\sigma} = E\\dot{\\varepsilon} - \\frac{E}{H'}\\dot{\\sigma}\n$$\n$$\n\\dot{\\sigma}\\left(1 + \\frac{E}{H'}\\right) = E\\dot{\\varepsilon}\n$$\n$$\n\\dot{\\sigma}\\left(\\frac{H' + E}{H'}\\right) = E\\dot{\\varepsilon}\n$$\n$$\n\\dot{\\sigma} = \\left(\\frac{E H'}{E + H'}\\right)\\dot{\\varepsilon}\n$$\nThe elastoplastic tangent modulus for reloading, $E^{ep}_{\\mathrm{reload}}$, is the coefficient of $\\dot{\\varepsilon}$. This is also known as the consistent tangent modulus for this one-dimensional problem.\n$$\nE^{ep}_{\\mathrm{reload}} = \\frac{E H'}{E + H'}\n$$\nThis expression is independent of the amount of prior plastic strain, as required by the problem statement. The initial yield stress $\\sigma_{y0}$ and the accumulated plastic strain only determine the values of $\\sigma$ and $\\alpha$ at which reverse yielding occurs, but not the tangent stiffness during that subsequent plastic flow.\n\n### Numerical Evaluation\nThe material parameters are given as $E = 210\\ \\mathrm{GPa}$ and $H' = 6.0\\ \\mathrm{GPa}$.\n\n1.  **Unloading Tangent ($D_{\\mathrm{unload}}$)**: As derived, this is the elastic modulus.\n    $$\n    D_{\\mathrm{unload}} = E = 210\\ \\mathrm{GPa}\n    $$\n2.  **Young's Modulus ($E$)**: Given directly in the problem.\n    $$\n    E = 210\\ \\mathrm{GPa}\n    $$\n3.  **Elastoplastic Reloading Tangent ($E^{ep}_{\\mathrm{reload}}$)**: Using the derived formula:\n    $$\n    E^{ep}_{\\mathrm{reload}} = \\frac{E H'}{E + H'} = \\frac{(210\\ \\mathrm{GPa}) \\times (6.0\\ \\mathrm{GPa})}{210\\ \\mathrm{GPa} + 6.0\\ \\mathrm{GPa}} = \\frac{1260}{216}\\ \\mathrm{GPa}\n    $$\n    $$\n    E^{ep}_{\\mathrm{reload}} \\approx 5.8333...\\ \\mathrm{GPa}\n    $$\nRounding to four significant figures as requested:\n-   $D_{\\mathrm{unload}} = 210.0\\ \\mathrm{GPa}$\n-   $E = 210.0\\ \\mathrm{GPa}$\n-   $E^{ep}_{\\mathrm{reload}} = 5.833\\ \\mathrm{GPa}$\n\nThe final result is presented as the row matrix $\\left(D_{\\mathrm{unload}},\\ E,\\ E^{ep}_{\\mathrm{reload}}\\right)$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n210.0 & 210.0 & 5.833\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "2882994"}]}
