The members are $LA$, $RB$ (verticals), $LR$ (top chord), $AB$ (bottom chord), and the two diagonals $LB$ and $RA$. The supports at $A$ and $B$ prevent translation in both the horizontal and vertical directions. Equal vertical concentrated loads $P$ are applied downward at joints $L$ and $R$.

The final answer must be a single analytic expression for $P$ (no units inside the final box).", "solution": "The problem requires the determination of an upper-bound collapse load for a specified redundant truss structure using the Upper Bound Theorem of plastic limit analysis. The core of this method is the Principle of Virtual Power, which states that for any kinematically admissible collapse mechanism, the rate of work done by the external loads must equal the rate of energy dissipated internally by plastic deformation. The load calculated from this equality provides an upper bound to the true collapse load.\n\nFirst, we must define a kinematically admissible collapse mechanism. The problem specifies a symmetric mechanism in which only the vertical members, $LA$, and $RB$, and the diagonal members, $LB$, and $RA$, undergo plastic deformation. The horizontal members, $LR$, and $AB$, are stipulated to have zero axial strain rate, meaning their lengths must remain constant during the virtual motion.\n\nThe supports at joints $A(0,0)$ and $B(b,0)$ are fixed pins, which prevent any translation. Therefore, the velocity vectors at these joints are zero:\n$$ \\dot{\\mathbf{v}}_A = (0,0) \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\dot{\\mathbf{v}}_B = (0,0) $$\nThis immediately satisfies the condition that the length of the bottom chord $AB$ remains constant.\n\nFor the top chord $LR$, connecting joints $L(0,h)$ and $R(b,h)$, the length must also remain constant. The rate of elongation of member $LR$, denoted $\\dot{\\Delta}_{LR}$, is given by the projection of the relative velocity of its endpoints onto the member's axis. Let the velocities of joints $L$ and $R$ be $\\dot{\\mathbf{v}}_L = (\\dot{u}_L, \\dot{v}_L)$ and $\\dot{\\mathbf{v}}_R = (\\dot{u}_R, \\dot{v}_R)$, respectively. The unit vector along $LR$ is $\\mathbf{n}_{LR} = (1, 0)$.\n$$ \\dot{\\Delta}_{LR} = (\\dot{\\mathbf{v}}_R - \\dot{\\mathbf{v}}_L) \\cdot \\mathbf{n}_{LR} = (\\dot{u}_R - \\dot{u}_L, \\dot{v}_R - \\dot{v}_L) \\cdot (1,0) = \\dot{u}_R - \\dot{u}_L $$\nThe condition $\\dot{\\Delta}_{LR} = 0$ requires $\\dot{u}_R = \\dot{u}_L$. Due to the symmetry of the structure and the applied loads, the collapse mechanism is also expected to be symmetric. This implies $\\dot{u}_L = -\\dot{u}_R$ and $\\dot{v}_L = \\dot{v}_R$. To satisfy both $\\dot{u}_R = \\dot{u}_L$ and $\\dot{u}_R = -\\dot{u}_L$, it must be that $\\dot{u}_L = \\dot{u}_R = 0$.\nThus, a simple, symmetric, and kinematically admissible mechanism consists of a purely vertical downward motion of the top chord $LR$. We define this vertical velocity rate as $\\dot{\\delta}$. The velocity vectors of the upper joints are:\n$$ \\dot{\\mathbf{v}}_L = (0, -\\dot{\\delta}) \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\dot{\\mathbf{v}}_R = (0, -\\dot{\\delta}) $$\nThis mechanism is kinematically admissible because it respects all boundary conditions and internal constraints.\n\nNext, we calculate the rate of external work, $\\dot{W}_{ext}$.

Let the rigid segment $[a, b]$ rotate with rate $\\dot{\\theta} > 0$.\nFor $a \\le x \\le b$:\n$$ \\dot{w}(x) = \\dot{\\theta}(x-a) $$\nThe segment $[b, L]$ pivots to satisfy $\\dot{w}(L)=0$. Its rotation rate $\\dot{\\phi}$ is:\n$$ \\dot{\\phi} = \\frac{\\dot{w}(L) - \\dot{w}(b)}{L-b} = \\frac{0 - \\dot{\\theta}(b-a)}{L-b} = -\\frac{\\dot{\\theta}(b-a)}{L-b} $$\nThe velocity field is:\n$$ \\dot{w}(x) = \\begin{cases} 0 & 0 \\le x \\le a \\\\ \\dot{\\theta}(x-a) & a \\le x \\le b \\\\ \\dot{\\theta}(b-a)\\frac{L-x}{L-b} & b \\le x \\le L \\end{cases} $$\nThe plastic hinge rotation rates are:\nAt $x=a$: $\\dot{\\theta}_{p,a} = |\\dot{w}'(a^{+}) - \\dot{w}'(a^{-})| = |\\dot{\\theta} - 0| = \\dot{\\theta}$.\nAt $x=b$: $\\dot{\\theta}_{p,b} = |\\dot{w}'(b^{+}) - \\dot{w}'(b^{-})| = |\\dot{\\phi} - \\dot{\\theta}| = |-\\frac{\\dot{\\theta}(b-a)}{L-b} - \\dot{\\theta}| = \\dot{\\theta}(1 + \\frac{b-a}{L-b}) = \\dot{\\theta}\\frac{L-a}{L-b}$.\nThe rate of internal dissipation is:\n$$ \\dot{D}_{i} = M_{p}(\\dot{\\theta}_{p,a} + \\dot{\\theta}_{p,b}) = M_{p}(\\dot{\\theta} + \\dot{\\theta}\\frac{L-a}{L-b}) = M_{p}\\dot{\\theta}\\frac{2L-a-b}{L-b} $$\nThe rate of external work is:\n$$ \\dot{W}_{e} = \\int_{a}^{L} q_{\\mathrm{ub}}\\dot{w}(x) dx = q_{\\mathrm{ub}}\\frac{1}{2}(L-a)\\dot{w}(b) = q_{\\mathrm{ub}}\\frac{1}{2}(L-a)\\dot{\\theta}(b-a) $$\nEquating rates:\n$$ q_{\\mathrm{ub}}(L-a)(b-a)\\frac{\\dot{\\theta}}{2} = M_{p}\\dot{\\theta}\\frac{2L-a-b}{L-b} \\implies q_{\\mathrm{ub}}(a,b) = 2M_{p}\\frac{2L-a-b}{(L-a)(b-a)(L-b)} $$\nTo find the minimum, we must analyze $q_{\\mathrm{ub}}(a,b)$ over the domain $0<a<b<L$. The expression tends to infinity as $b \\to L$ or as $a \\to b$. The minimum, therefore, must occur on the boundary $a \\to 0$.\nIn the limit as $a \\to 0$:\n$$ q_{\\mathrm{ub}}(0,b) = \\lim_{a\\to0} 2M_{p}\\frac{2L-a-b}{(L-a)(b-a)(L-b)} = 2M_{p}\\frac{2L-b}{L \\cdot b \\cdot (L-b)} $$\nThis represents a mechanism with hinges at $x=0$ and $x=b$. Minimizing this with respect to $b$ gives the equation $b^{2} - 4bL + 2L^{2} = 0$, which is identical to the equation for $a$ in Mechanism $\\mathcal{M}_{1}$. The valid solution is $b = (2-\\sqrt{2})L$.\nThis demonstrates that Mechanism $\\mathcal{M}_{1}$ is a limiting case of Mechanism $\\mathcal{M}_{2}$ as $a \\to 0$. The minimum of the more general (but artificially constrained) function $q_{\\mathrm{ub}}(a,b)$ occurs on its boundary, and this minimum coincides with the minimum of the simpler mechanism.\nTherefore, the minimized upper bound for Mechanism $\\mathcal{M}_{2}$ is:\n$$ q_{\\mathrm{ub},2} = q_{\\mathrm{ub}}(0, (2-\\sqrt{2})L) = \\frac{2M_{p}}{L^{2}}(3+2\\sqrt{2}) $$\n\nComparison and Final Answer\nThe minimized upper bound for Mechanism $\\mathcal{M}_{1}$ is $q_{\\mathrm{ub},1} = \\frac{2M_{p}(3+2\\sqrt{2})}{L^{2}}$.\nThe minimized upper bound for Mechanism $\\mathcal{M}_{2}$ is $q_{\\mathrm{ub},2} = \\frac{2M_{p}(3+2\\sqrt{2})}{L^{2}}$.\nThe two values are identical. The globally smallest upper bound between the two specified mechanisms is this common value.
