It presents a standard exercise in continuum mechanics, specifically on the decomposition of the Cauchy stress tensor.\n\nThe analysis begins with the fundamental additive decomposition of the Cauchy stress tensor $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}$ into a spherical (hydrostatic) part and a deviatoric part. This is given by the relation:\n$$\n\\boldsymbol{\\sigma} = p\\,\\boldsymbol{I} + \\boldsymbol{s}\n$$\nwhere $\\boldsymbol{s}$ is the deviatoric stress tensor, $\\boldsymbol{I}$ is the second-order identity tensor, and $p$ is the hydrostatic pressure. The hydrostatic pressure $p$ is defined as one-third of the trace of the stress tensor:\n$$\np = \\frac{1}{3}\\operatorname{tr}(\\boldsymbol{\\sigma})\n$$\nThe trace of a tensor is an invariant, meaning it is independent of the coordinate system. In any coordinate system, $\\operatorname{tr}(\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}) = \\sigma_{11} + \\sigma_{22} + \\sigma_{33}$. In the principal coordinate system, the off-diagonal components of the stress tensor are zero, and the diagonal components are the principal stresses $\\sigma_1$, $\\sigma_2$, and $\\sigma_3$. Thus, the trace is the sum of the principal stresses:\n$$\n\\operatorname{tr}(\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}) = \\sigma_1 + \\sigma_2 + \\sigma_3\n$$\nSubstituting this into the definition of hydrostatic pressure gives:\n$$\np = \\frac{1}{3}(\\sigma_1 + \\sigma_2 + \\sigma_3)\n$$\nThis quantity $p$ is also known as the mean stress.\n\nTo find the deviatoric stress tensor $\\boldsymbol{s}$, we rearrange the initial decomposition:\n$$\n\\boldsymbol{s} = \\boldsymbol{\\sigma} - p\\,\\boldsymbol{I}\n$$\nFor an isotropic material, the principal directions of the stress tensor $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}$ and the deviatoric stress tensor $\\boldsymbol{s}$ are coaxial. Therefore, we can write this tensor equation in the principal coordinate system, where $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}$ and $\\boldsymbol{s}$ are represented by diagonal matrices of their principal values $(s_1, s_2, s_3)$ and $(\\sigma_1, \\sigma_2, \\sigma_3)$, respectively.

Compute the elastic trial stress.\n2.  Check for yielding using the von Mises criterion.\n3.  If yielding occurs, compute the final stress state via a plastic correction (return mapping).\n\n**1. Elastic Predictor (Trial Stress)**\n\nWe assume the entire strain increment $\\Delta\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}$ is elastic and compute a \"trial\" stress state, $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}^{trial}$. The initial stress is $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}_0 = \\boldsymbol{0}$. According to Hooke's law for an isotropic material, the stress increment is related to the strain increment by $\\Delta\\boldsymbol{\\sigma} = \\lambda\\text{tr}(\\Delta\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon})\\boldsymbol{I} + 2G\\Delta\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}$, where $\\lambda$ is Lamé's first parameter and $\\boldsymbol{I}$ is the identity tensor.\nThe trial stress is:\n$$\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}^{trial} = \\boldsymbol{\\sigma}_0 + \\lambda\\text{tr}(\\Delta\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon})\\boldsymbol{I} + 2G\\Delta\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}$$\nThe given strain increment tensor is $\\Delta \\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0  \\frac{\\Delta \\gamma}{2}  0 \\\\ \\frac{\\Delta \\gamma}{2}  0  0 \\\\ 0  0  0 \\end{pmatrix}$.\nThe trace of the strain increment is $\\text{tr}(\\Delta\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}) = 0+0+0 = 0$. This signifies a purely deviatoric strain increment.\nSince $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}_0 = \\boldsymbol{0}$ and $\\text{tr}(\\Delta\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}) = 0$, the trial stress simplifies to:\n$$\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}^{trial} = 2G\\Delta\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon} = 2G \\begin{pmatrix} 0  \\frac{\\Delta \\gamma}{2}  0 \\\\ \\frac{\\Delta \\gamma}{2}  0  0 \\\\ 0  0  0 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0  G\\Delta\\gamma  0 \\\\ G\\Delta\\gamma  0  0 \\\\ 0  0  0 \\end{pmatrix}$$\nThe only non-zero component is the shear stress $\\sigma_{12}^{trial} = G\\Delta\\gamma$.

Yield Check**\n\nWe must check if this trial stress state lies within the elastic domain. The von Mises yield function is $f(\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}) = \\sigma_{eq} - \\sigma_y$, where $\\sigma_{eq}$ is the von Mises equivalent stress. Yielding occurs if $f(\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}^{trial}) > 0$.\nThe equivalent stress is defined as $\\sigma_{eq} = \\sqrt{\\frac{3}{2}\\boldsymbol{s}:\\boldsymbol{s}}$, where $\\boldsymbol{s}$ is the deviatoric stress tensor, $\\boldsymbol{s} = \\boldsymbol{\\sigma} - \\frac{1}{3}\\text{tr}(\\boldsymbol{\\sigma})\\boldsymbol{I}$.\nFor the trial stress, $\\text{tr}(\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}^{trial}) = 0$, so $\\boldsymbol{s}^{trial} = \\boldsymbol{\\sigma}^{trial}$.\nThe tensor inner product $\\boldsymbol{s}^{trial}:\\boldsymbol{s}^{trial}$ is:\n$$\\boldsymbol{s}^{trial}:\\boldsymbol{s}^{trial} = \\sum_{i,j} s_{ij}^{trial}s_{ij}^{trial} = (\\sigma_{12}^{trial})^2 + (\\sigma_{21}^{trial})^2 = 2(\\sigma_{12}^{trial})^2$$\nThe trial equivalent stress is therefore:\n$$\\sigma_{eq}^{trial} = \\sqrt{\\frac{3}{2} \\left[2(\\sigma_{12}^{trial})^2\\right]} = \\sqrt{3(\\sigma_{12}^{trial})^2} = \\sqrt{3}|\\sigma_{12}^{trial}|$$\nSubstituting the value of $\\sigma_{12}^{trial}$:\n$$\\sigma_{eq}^{trial} = \\sqrt{3} \\times \\frac{300}{1.3}\\,\\text{MPa} \\approx 399.68\\,\\text{MPa}$$\nWe compare this to the uniaxial yield stress $\\sigma_y = 250\\,\\text{MPa}$.\nSince $\\sigma_{eq}^{trial} \\approx 399.68\\,\\text{MPa} > \\sigma_y = 250\\,\\text{MPa}$, the yield condition is violated ($f(\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}^{trial}) > 0$).\n**Conclusion: Plasticity is activated during this strain increment.** A plastic correction is required.\n\n**3. Plastic Corrector (Return Mapping)**\n\nFor a perfectly plastic material, the final stress state, $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}_1$, must lie on the yield surface, i.e., $\\sigma_{eq,1} = \\sigma_y$.\nThe associative flow rule for J2 plasticity (Prandtl-Reuss) implies that the plastic strain increment $\\Delta\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}^p$ is proportional to the final deviatoric stress $\\boldsymbol{s}_1$. This leads to the \"radial return\" algorithm, where the trial deviatoric stress is scaled back radially to the yield surface.\nThe final stress tensor is found by scaling the trial stress tensor. As shown before, the initial, trial, and final stress states are all purely deviatoric, so $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma} = \\boldsymbol{s}$.\nThe return mapping formula for perfect plasticity is:\n$$\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}_1 = \\boldsymbol{s}_1 = \\frac{\\sigma_y}{\\sigma_{eq}^{trial}} \\boldsymbol{s}^{trial} = \\frac{\\sigma_y}{\\sigma_{eq}^{trial}} \\boldsymbol{\\sigma}^{trial}$$\nWe are interested in the component $\\sigma_{12,1}$:\n$$\\sigma_{12,1} = \\frac{\\sigma_y}{\\sigma_{eq}^{trial}} \\sigma_{12}^{trial}$$\nSubstituting the expression for $\\sigma_{eq}^{trial} = \\sqrt{3}|\\sigma_{12}^{trial}|$:\n$$\\sigma_{12,1} = \\frac{\\sigma_y}{\\sqrt{3}|\\sigma_{12}^{trial}|} \\sigma_{12}^{trial}$$\nSince $\\sigma_{12}^{trial} > 0$, we have $|\\sigma_{12}^{trial}| = \\sigma_{12}^{trial}$, which simplifies the expression to:\n$$\\sigma_{12,1} = \\frac{\\sigma_y}{\\sqrt{3}}$$\nThis result indicates that for a state of pure shear, the shear stress reaches a specific value on the yield surface, which is independent of the magnitude of the plastic strain. This is the shear yield strength $\\tau_y$.\nUsing the given value $\\sigma_y = 250\\,\\text{MPa}$:\n$$\\sigma_{12,1} = \\frac{250}{\\sqrt{3}}\\,\\text{MPa} \\approx 144.337567...\\,\\text{MPa}$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures.\n$$\\sigma_{12,1} \\approx 144.3\\,\\text{MPa}$$\n\nThe final updated Cauchy stress component is $\\sigma_{12} = 144.3\\,\\text{MPa}$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{144.3}$$", "id": "2911185"}]}
