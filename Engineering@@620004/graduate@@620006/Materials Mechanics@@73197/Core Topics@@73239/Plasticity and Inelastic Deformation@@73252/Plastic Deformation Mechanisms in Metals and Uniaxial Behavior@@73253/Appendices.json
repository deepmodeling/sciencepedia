The instantaneous area is $A_i = \\frac{\\pi d_i^2}{4}$.\n\nThe core assumption is the conservation of volume in the plastic regime: $A_i L_i = A_0 L_0$. From this, we can express the ratio of instantaneous length $L_i$ to initial length $L_0$ in terms of the diameters:\n$$ \\frac{L_i}{L_0} = \\frac{A_0}{A_i} = \\frac{\\pi D_0^2 / 4}{\\pi d_i^2 / 4} = \\left(\\frac{D_0}{d_i}\\right)^2 $$\n\nWe now use the provided definitions for stress and strain.\n\nTask 1: True Stress and True Strain\nThe true stress $\\sigma_{\\mathrm{t},i}$ is defined as the load divided by the instantaneous area:\n$$ \\sigma_{\\mathrm{t},i} = \\frac{F_i}{A_i} = \\frac{F_i}{\\pi d_i^2 / 4} $$\nThe true strain $\\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{t},i}$ is defined as the natural logarithm of the length ratio.

It presents a standard exercise in materials mechanics based on established principles. The problem is therefore deemed valid. A solution will be provided.\n\nThe problem requires the analysis of uniaxial true stress-strain data for metals using the Hollomon power-law relation. This empirical model describes the plastic flow behavior of many metals after yielding. The relation is given by:\n$$\n\\sigma = K \\varepsilon_{p}^{n}\n$$\nwhere $\\sigma$ is the true stress, $\\varepsilon_{p}$ is the true plastic strain, $K$ is the strength coefficient, and $n$ is the strain-hardening exponent. Both $K$ and $n$ are material constants determined from experimental data.\n\nTo determine the parameters $K$ and $n$ from a given set of data points $(\\varepsilon_{p,i}, \\sigma_i)$, the problem specifies a linear least-squares fit on the logarithmically transformed variables. Taking the natural logarithm of the Hollomon relation yields a linear equation:\n$$\n\\ln(\\sigma) = \\ln(K) + n \\ln(\\varepsilon_{p})\n$$\nThis is an equation of a straight line, $y = a + nx$, where $y = \\ln(\\sigma)$, $x = \\ln(\\varepsilon_{p})$, the slope is the strain-hardening exponent $n$, and the y-intercept is $a = \\ln(K)$.\n\nFor a set of $N$ data points $(x_i, y_i)$, the ordinary least-squares method finds the parameters $n$ and $a$ that minimize the sum of the squared residuals, $S = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} (y_i - (a + nx_i))^2$. The analytical solution for the slope $n$ and intercept $a$ is:\n$$\nn = \\frac{N \\sum_{i=1}^{N}(x_i y_i) - (\\sum_{i=1}^{N} x_i)(\\sum_{i=1}^{N} y_i)}{N \\sum_{i=1}^{N}(x_i^2) - (\\sum_{i=1}^{N} x_i)^2}\n$$\n$$\na = \\bar{y} - n \\bar{x}\n$$\nwhere $\\bar{x} = \\frac{1}{N}\\sum_{i=1}^{N} x_i$ and $\\bar{y} = \\frac{1}{N}\\sum_{i=1}^{N} y_i$ are the mean values. Once the intercept $a$ is found, the strength coefficient $K$ is recovered by the inverse transformation:\n$$\nK = \\exp(a)\n$$\nThe second task is to determine the uniform true strain at the onset of necking, $\\varepsilon_u$, using the Considère criterion. The criterion states that plastic instability (necking) begins when the slope of the true stress-true strain curve equals the true stress itself:\n$$\n\\frac{d\\sigma}{d\\varepsilon} = \\sigma\n$$\nIn the context of large plastic deformation, the elastic part of the strain is negligible compared to the plastic part, so we can make the approximation that the total true strain $\\varepsilon$ is equal to the true plastic strain $\\varepsilon_{p}$. This is a standard simplification in plasticity analysis. The criterion becomes:\n$$\n\\frac{d\\sigma}{d\\varepsilon_{p}} = \\sigma\n$$\nSubstituting the Hollomon relation $\\sigma = K \\varepsilon_{p}^{n}$ into this criterion:\n$$\n\\frac{d}{d\\varepsilon_{p}}(K \\varepsilon_{p}^{n}) = K \\varepsilon_{p}^{n}\n$$\nThe derivative on the left side is $nK\\varepsilon_{p}^{n-1}$. Thus, we have:\n$$\nnK\\varepsilon_{p}^{n-1} = K\\varepsilon_{p}^{n}\n$$\nFor a deforming material, $K > 0$ and $\\varepsilon_p > 0$. We can divide both sides by $K\\varepsilon_{p}^{n-1}$, which yields a remarkably simple result:\n$$\nn = \\varepsilon_{p}\n$$\nThis means that for a material following the Hollomon relation, necking begins at a true plastic strain that is numerically equal to the strain-hardening exponent. Therefore, the uniform true strain at the onset of necking is $\\varepsilon_u = n$.\n\nFinally, the problem requires the prediction of the flow stress $\\sigma(\\varepsilon^\\star)$ at a specified true plastic strain $\\varepsilon^\\star$. This is a direct application of the fitted Hollomon equation:\n$$\n\\sigma(\\varepsilon^\\star) = K (\\varepsilon^\\star)^n\n$$\nwhere $K$ and $n$ are the parameters determined from the least-squares fit.\n\nThe computational procedure for each test case is as follows:\n1.  Given the data pairs $(\\varepsilon_{p,i}, \\sigma_i)$, compute their natural logarithms to obtain the transformed data $(x_i, y_i) = (\\ln(\\varepsilon_{p,i}), \\ln(\\sigma_i))$.\n2.  Perform a linear regression on the $(x_i, y_i)$ data to find the slope $n$ and intercept $a=\\ln(K)$.\n3.  Calculate the strength coefficient $K=\\exp(a)$.\n4.  The uniform true strain at necking is $\\varepsilon_u = n$.\n5.  Calculate the predicted stress at $\\varepsilon^\\star$ using $\\sigma(\\varepsilon^\\star) = K(\\varepsilon^\\star)^n$.\n6.  Round the final values as specified: $K$ and $\\sigma(\\varepsilon^\\star)$ to $2$ decimal places, and $n$ and $\\varepsilon_u$ to $5$ decimal places.\n\nThis procedure will be implemented for all provided test cases.

In uniaxial stress, the axial plastic strain increment is aligned with the axial stress sign.\n- Elastic trial state: given a strain increment leading to a trial stress $\\sigma_\\mathrm{tr}$, assess whether $f(\\sigma_\\mathrm{tr}, \\alpha_n) \\le 0$ (purely elastic) or $f(\\sigma_\\mathrm{tr}, \\alpha_n) &gt; 0$ (plastic correction needed).\n- Consistency condition in the plastic case: the updated stress must satisfy $f(\\sigma, \\alpha) = 0$ together with the associative flow, yielding a scalar plastic multiplier increment $\\Delta \\gamma \\ge 0$ and the axial plastic strain increment $\\Delta \\varepsilon_p$ whose sign is consistent with $\\sigma_\\mathrm{tr}$.\n\nYour program must:\n- For each provided test case, implement the uniaxial return mapping step that, given $(E, \\sigma_{y0}, H, \\alpha_n, \\sigma_\\mathrm{tr})$, decides elastic versus plastic response and computes the axial plastic strain increment $\\Delta \\varepsilon_p$ for that step. Use the principle that in uniaxial $\\mathrm{J2}$ plasticity the axial plastic strain increment is colinear with the axial stress and its magnitude is the plastic multiplier increment, so that $\\Delta \\varepsilon_p = \\operatorname{sign}(\\sigma_\\mathrm{tr}) \\, \\Delta \\gamma$, with $\\Delta \\gamma$ obtained by enforcing the consistency condition together with uniaxial elasticity.\n- If the step is elastic, return $\\Delta \\varepsilon_p = 0$.\n- If the step is plastic, return the computed $\\Delta \\varepsilon_p$ as a real number.\n\nTest suite:\nProvide a function that evaluates the following set of test cases, each specified by $(E,\\sigma_{y0},H,\\alpha_n,\\sigma_\\mathrm{tr})$ in units of megapascals for stresses and moduli:\n- Case A (elastic interior): $(E,\\sigma_{y0},H,\\alpha_n,\\sigma_\\mathrm{tr}) = (\\,210000,\\,250,\\,1000,\\,0.01,\\,200\\,)$.\n- Case B (on the yield surface): $(E,\\sigma_{y0},H,\\alpha_n,\\sigma_\\mathrm{tr}) = (\\,70000,\\,150,\\,500,\\,0.1,\\,200\\,)$.\n- Case C (plastic in tension): $(E,\\sigma_{y0},H,\\alpha_n,\\sigma_\\mathrm{tr}) = (\\,210000,\\,250,\\,1000,\\,0.02,\\,300\\,)$.\n- Case D (plastic in compression, perfect plasticity): $(E,\\sigma_{y0},H,\\alpha_n,\\sigma_\\mathrm{tr}) = (\\,210000,\\,300,\\,0,\\,0.0,\\,-400\\,)$.\n- Case E (plastic in tension with significant hardening): $(E,\\sigma_{y0},H,\\alpha_n,\\sigma_\\mathrm{tr}) = (\\,210000,\\,300,\\,2000,\\,0.2,\\,750\\,)$.\n- Case F (elastic in compression): $(E,\\sigma_{y0},H,\\alpha_n,\\sigma_\\mathrm{tr}) = (\\,210000,\\,250,\\,500,\\,0.0,\\,-100\\,)$.\n\nOutput specification:\n- For each case, compute the scalar axial plastic strain increment $\\Delta \\varepsilon_p$ for that increment. This quantity is dimensionless. Round each result to ten decimal places.\n- Your program should produce a single line of output containing the results as a comma-separated list enclosed in square brackets, in the order A through F, for example, \"[x_A,x_B,x_C,x_D,x_E,x_F]\".", "solution": "The problem statement is subjected to validation before any attempt at a solution.\n\n**Step 1: Extract Givens**\n- **Model**: Uniaxial J2 (von Mises) plasticity with linear isotropic hardening.\n- **Material Parameters**: Young’s modulus $E$ (MPa), initial yield stress $\\sigma_{y0}$ (MPa), isotropic hardening modulus $H$ (MPa).\n- **State Variables**: Accumulated equivalent plastic strain at the start of the increment, $\\alpha_n$.\n- **Input for Algorithm**: A tuple $(E, \\sigma_{y0}, H, \\alpha_n, \\sigma_\\mathrm{tr})$, where $\\sigma_\\mathrm{tr}$ is the trial axial stress.\n- **Governing Relations (Uniaxial Case)**:\n    - **Hooke's Law**: $\\sigma = E(\\varepsilon - \\varepsilon_p)$.\n    - **Effective Stress**: $\\sigma_\\mathrm{eq} = \\lvert \\sigma \\rvert$.\n    - **Yield Function**: $f(\\sigma, \\alpha) = \\sigma_\\mathrm{eq} - \\sigma_y(\\alpha)$.\n    - **Yield Stress Evolution (Linear Isotropic Hardening)**: $\\sigma_y(\\alpha) = \\sigma_{y0} + H \\alpha$.\n    - **Flow Rule**: $\\Delta \\varepsilon_p = \\operatorname{sign}(\\sigma_\\mathrm{tr}) \\, \\Delta \\gamma$, where $\\Delta \\gamma \\ge 0$ is the plastic multiplier increment.\n    - **Hardening Law**: The increment in accumulated plastic strain is $\\Delta\\alpha = \\Delta\\gamma$.\n- **Algorithm Logic (Predictor-Corrector)**:\n    - **Elastic Predictor**: A purely elastic step is assumed, leading to a trial stress $\\sigma_\\mathrm{tr}$.\n    - **Yield Check**: The response is elastic if $f(\\sigma_\\mathrm{tr}, \\alpha_n) \\le 0$, resulting in $\\Delta \\varepsilon_p = 0$.\n    - **Plastic Corrector**: If $f(\\sigma_\\mathrm{tr}, \\alpha_n) > 0$, a plastic correction is performed to enforce the consistency condition $f(\\sigma_{n+1}, \\alpha_{n+1}) = 0$ at the end of the increment.\n- **Test Cases**:\n    - A: $(E, \\sigma_{y0}, H, \\alpha_n, \\sigma_\\mathrm{tr}) = (210000, 250, 1000, 0.01, 200)$\n    - B: $(70000, 150, 500, 0.1, 200)$\n    - C: $(210000, 250, 1000, 0.02, 300)$\n    - D: $(210000, 300, 0, 0.0, -400)$\n    - E: $(210000, 300, 2000, 0.2, 750)$\n    - F: $(210000, 250, 500, 0.0, -100)$\n\n**Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens**\nThe problem is assessed for validity.\n- **Scientifically Grounded**: The problem describes the classical theory of rate-independent elastoplasticity (J2 plasticity with linear isotropic hardening), a cornerstone of computational solid mechanics.

The simplified uniaxial relations are consistent with the general 3D J2 plasticity theory.\n- **Realism**: The numerical values for material properties and stresses in the test cases are representative of common engineering metals like steel and aluminum, making the problem physically realistic.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is **valid**. It is a standard, well-defined problem in computational plasticity. A rigorous solution will be developed.\n\n**Derivation of the Uniaxial Return Mapping Algorithm**\n\nThe algorithm operates on an operator-split or predictor-corrector framework. For a given time increment, we first compute a trial state assuming the material response is purely elastic. We then check if this trial state violates the yield condition. If it does, a plastic corrector step is applied to return the state to the updated yield surface.\n\n**1. State at the beginning of the increment (time $n$)**\nThe state is defined by the accumulated equivalent plastic strain, $\\alpha_n$. The yield stress at this point is:\n$$\n\\sigma_{y,n} = \\sigma_{y0} + H \\alpha_n\n$$\n\n**2. Elastic Predictor Step**\nA trial stress, $\\sigma_\\mathrm{tr}$, is given. This stress would be the correct final stress if the entire increment were elastic. We evaluate the yield function at this trial state:\n$$\nf_\\mathrm{tr} = f(\\sigma_\\mathrm{tr}, \\alpha_n) = |\\sigma_\\mathrm{tr}| - \\sigma_{y,n} = |\\sigma_\\mathrm{tr}| - (\\sigma_{y0} + H \\alpha_n)\n$$\n\n**3. Elastic-Plastic Decision**\nThe Kuhn-Tucker loading/unloading conditions dictate the nature of the step:\n- If $f_\\mathrm{tr} \\le 0$: The trial state is inside or on the yield surface. The state is elastically admissible, and the step is purely elastic. The plastic strain increment is zero: $\\Delta \\varepsilon_p = 0$.\n- If $f_\\mathrm{tr} > 0$: The trial state is outside the yield surface, which is physically inadmissible. A plastic correction is necessary. This implies that plastic flow occurs during the increment, governed by a non-zero plastic multiplier $\\Delta \\gamma > 0$.\n\n**4. Plastic Corrector Step (Return Mapping)**\nWhen $f_\\mathrm{tr} > 0$, we must find the final state $(\\sigma_{n+1}, \\alpha_{n+1})$ that satisfies the constitutive relations. The system of equations is as follows:\n\n- **Stress Update**: The final stress $\\sigma_{n+1}$ is obtained by correcting the trial stress for the plastic strain that occurs during the increment. From the integrated form of Hooke's Law, this relationship is:\n$$\n\\sigma_{n+1} = \\sigma_\\mathrm{tr} - E \\Delta \\varepsilon_p\n$$\n- **Flow Rule**: The plastic strain increment is defined by the associative flow rule. For the uniaxial case, this simplifies to:\n$$\n\\Delta \\varepsilon_p = \\operatorname{sign}(\\sigma_\\mathrm{tr}) \\Delta \\gamma\n$$\nThe sign is taken from the trial stress because the return path is radial, meaning $\\sigma_{n+1}$ will have the same sign as $\\sigma_\\mathrm{tr}$.\n- **Hardening Law**: The accumulated plastic strain $\\alpha$ evolves with plastic flow. The problem states this relation is $\\Delta\\alpha = \\Delta\\gamma$, which is correct for uniaxial loading under J2 plasticity. The updated value is:\n$$\n\\alpha_{n+1} = \\alpha_n + \\Delta\\alpha = \\alpha_n + \\Delta\\gamma\n$$\n- **Consistency Condition**: The final state must lie on the updated yield surface:\n$$\nf(\\sigma_{n+1}, \\alpha_{n+1}) = |\\sigma_{n+1}| - (\\sigma_{y0} + H \\alpha_{n+1}) = 0\n$$\n\nWe now solve this system for the unknown plastic multiplier $\\Delta \\gamma$. Substituting the expressions for $\\sigma_{n+1}$ and $\\alpha_{n+1}$ into the consistency condition:\n$$\n|\\sigma_\\mathrm{tr} - E \\Delta \\varepsilon_p| - (\\sigma_{y0} + H (\\alpha_n + \\Delta\\gamma)) = 0\n$$\nSubstituting $\\Delta \\varepsilon_p = \\operatorname{sign}(\\sigma_\\mathrm{tr}) \\Delta \\gamma$:\n$$\n|\\sigma_\\mathrm{tr} - E \\operatorname{sign}(\\sigma_\\mathrm{tr}) \\Delta \\gamma| - (\\sigma_{y0} + H \\alpha_n + H \\Delta\\gamma) = 0\n$$\nSince the return mapping is radial towards the origin in the stress space, we have $|\\sigma_{n+1}| < |\\sigma_\\mathrm{tr}|$. This allows simplification of the absolute value term:\n$$\n\\operatorname{sign}(\\sigma_\\mathrm{tr})(\\sigma_\\mathrm{tr} - E \\operatorname{sign}(\\sigma_\\mathrm{tr}) \\Delta \\gamma) = |\\sigma_\\mathrm{tr}| - E \\Delta \\gamma\n$$\nThe consistency condition becomes:\n$$\n(|\\sigma_\\mathrm{tr}| - E \\Delta \\gamma) - (\\sigma_{y0} + H \\alpha_n + H \\Delta\\gamma) = 0\n$$\nWe group terms to solve for $\\Delta \\gamma$:\n$$\n|\\sigma_\\mathrm{tr}| - (\\sigma_{y0} + H \\alpha_n) = E \\Delta \\gamma + H \\Delta \\gamma\n$$\nThe left-hand side is precisely the yield function value at the trial state, $f_\\mathrm{tr}$.\n$$\nf_\\mathrm{tr} = (E + H) \\Delta \\gamma\n$$\nThis gives the analytical solution for the plastic multiplier increment:\n$$\n\\Delta \\gamma = \\frac{f_\\mathrm{tr}}{E + H} = \\frac{|\\sigma_\\mathrm{tr}| - (\\sigma_{y0} + H \\alpha_n)}{E + H}\n$$\nFinally, the axial plastic strain increment is computed using the flow rule:\n$$\n\\Delta \\varepsilon_p = \\operatorname{sign}(\\sigma_\\mathrm{tr}) \\Delta \\gamma = \\operatorname{sign}(\\sigma_\\mathrm{tr}) \\frac{|\\sigma_\\mathrm{tr}| - (\\sigma_{y0} + H \\alpha_n)}{E + H}\n$$\n\n**Final Algorithm**\n\nFor a given set of parameters $(E, \\sigma_{y0}, H, \\alpha_n, \\sigma_\\mathrm{tr})$:\n1.  Calculate current yield stress: $\\sigma_{y,n} = \\sigma_{y0} + H \\alpha_n$.\n2.  Calculate trial yield function value: $f_\\mathrm{tr} = |\\sigma_\\mathrm{tr}| - \\sigma_{y,n}$.\n3.  If $f_\\mathrm{tr} \\le 0$: The step is elastic. Set $\\Delta \\varepsilon_p = 0$.\n4.  If $f_\\mathrm{tr} > 0$: The step is plastic.
