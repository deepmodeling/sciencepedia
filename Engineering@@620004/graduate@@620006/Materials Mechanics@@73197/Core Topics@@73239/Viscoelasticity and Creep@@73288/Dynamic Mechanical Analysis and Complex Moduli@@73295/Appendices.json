A valid protocol must be based on first principles and systematically decouple the effects of instrument-side variables from material-side field variables.\n\nThe fundamental relationships for parallel-plate rheometry are key. Let the plate radius be $R$ and the gap between the plates be $h$. The measured instrument variables are the angular displacement amplitude, $\\theta_0$, and the torque amplitude, $M_0$. The material field variables, which are not uniform in this geometry, are the shear strain, $\\gamma$, and the shear stress, $\\tau$. The values are typically reported at the rim of the plate ($r=R$), where they are maximum.\n\nThe rim strain amplitude, $\\gamma_0$, is related to the angular displacement amplitude $\\theta_0$ by:\n$$ \\gamma_0 = \\frac{R \\theta_0}{h} $$\nThe rim stress amplitude, $\\tau_0$, is related to the torque amplitude $M_0$ by:\n$$ \\tau_0 = \\frac{2 M_0}{\\pi R^3} $$\nNote that $\\tau_0$ is proportional to $M_0$ with a constant of proportionality that is independent of the gap, $h$. In contrast, $\\gamma_0$ is proportional to $\\theta_0$ but also inversely proportional to $h$. This dependence on $h$ is the critical feature that can be exploited to distinguish certain sources of nonlinearity.\n\nMaterial nonlinearity is, by definition, a phenomenon that occurs when the material response ceases to be linear at a critical value of a field variable, such as a critical strain $\\gamma_c$ or a critical stress $\\tau_c$.\nInstrument nonlinearity originates from the measurement system itself, for example, when the angular displacement $\\theta_0$ or the torque $M_0$ exceeds the linear operating range of the angle encoder or the torque transducer, respectively.\n\nA robust protocol must be able to distinguish between the following cases:\n1.  Material nonlinearity driven by strain ($\\gamma_0$) versus instrument nonlinearity driven by angular displacement ($\\theta_0$).\n2.  Material nonlinearity driven by stress ($\\tau_0$) versus instrument nonlinearity driven by torque ($M_0$).\n\nBy varying the gap $h$, we can decouple the first pair of variables. If we conduct an experiment at a constant strain amplitude $\\gamma_0$, the required angular displacement $\\theta_0 = \\gamma_0 h / R$ will be different for different gaps. Conversely, at a constant angular displacement $\\theta_0$, the resulting strain on the material $\\gamma_0 = R \\theta_0 / h$ will be different. Therefore, if the onset of nonlinearity (e.g., measured by the appearance of higher harmonics or amplitude-dependence of $G^*$) always occurs at the same value of $\\gamma_0$ regardless of $h$, the nonlinearity is material strain-induced. If it always occurs at the same value of $\\theta_0$ regardless of $h$, it is due to the instrument's angle encoder.\n\nFor the second pair, varying $h$ is not sufficient because the relationship $\\tau_0 \\propto M_0$ is independent of $h$. This is where the provided reference material becomes essential. The reference material is known to be linear. Therefore, any nonlinearity observed when testing this material *must* originate from the instrument. By testing the reference material, we can map the instrument's linear operating window in terms of its own variables, $\\theta_0$ and $M_0$.\n\nThe best protocol will, therefore, combine the use of the reference material with experiments at varying gaps to first characterize the instrument's performance and then, using this knowledge, characterize the unknown material.\n\nNow, we evaluate each option:\n\n**A.

It fails to use the provided experimental tools (varying gap, reference material) to verify the source of nonlinearity. Relying on manufacturer specifications without independent verification is poor practice, as instrument performance can change over time. By using a single fixed gap, it is impossible to decouple the contributions of $\\gamma_0$ from $\\theta_0$, as they increase proportionally. Any observed nonlinearity could be from either the material or the instrument.\n\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**B.

If the onset of amplitude dependence of $G^{*}(\\omega)$ occurs at the same strain amplitude in both materials, conclude that the instrument is responsible; otherwise, attribute nonlinearity to the test material.**\n\nThis protocol uses the reference material but its logic is flawed and incomplete. It considers only one fixed gap, $h$. The conclusion is only valid if the instrument nonlinearity is angle-dependent. In that case, a critical angle $\\theta_c$ corresponds to a critical strain $\\gamma_c = R \\theta_c/h$, which would be the same for both materials. However, if the instrument nonlinearity is torque-dependent (occurs at a critical torque $M_c$), this corresponds to a critical stress $\\tau_c \\propto M_c$. The onset strain would then be $\\gamma_0 = \\tau_c / |G^*|$. Since the test material and reference material may have different moduli ($|G^*_{test}| \\neq |G^*_{ref}|$), the onset of nonlinearity would occur at different strain amplitudes, leading to the incorrect conclusion that the nonlinearity is material-driven.

Then perform a single amplitude sweep at one temperature and infer whether nonlinearity is material- or instrument-driven by checking whether the amplitude dependence matches the shift factors from time–temperature superposition.**\n\nThis approach is fundamentally flawed as a primary validation method. It relies on a theoretical model (such as the Cox-Merz rule or similar relations) that connects linear viscoelastic data to nonlinear behavior. This is a model-based *interpretation* of data, not a direct *verification* of the measurement's validity. This method cannot detect instrument nonlinearity if it occurs. It assumes from the outset that any observed nonlinearity is from the material and then tries to model it. It fails to address the core question of distinguishing the source of the signal.\n\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**E.

Corrections for instrument inertia and friction are typically applied to remove linear, parasitic signals from the measurement. However, the type of nonlinearity discussed—from transducer or encoder limits—is not a simple additive artifact that can be measured in an empty test and subtracted. A nonlinear transducer response is a distortion of the signal itself, not an offset. The assumption that this subtraction \"removes any instrument nonlinearity\" is fundamentally incorrect.

To a leading-order approximation, the peak of the averaged property occurs when the average temperature in the specimen equals the intrinsic peak temperature $T_p$.\nThe average temperature across the specimen is $\\bar{T}(t) = \\frac{1}{L} \\int_{-L/2}^{L/2} T(x,t) \\,dx = T_s(t) + \\langle \\theta \\rangle$, where $\\langle \\theta \\rangle$ is the average temperature deficit.\n$$ \\langle \\theta \\rangle = \\frac{1}{L} \\int_{-L/2}^{L/2} \\frac{\\beta}{2\\alpha} \\left( x^2 - \\frac{L^2}{4} \\right) \\,dx = \\frac{\\beta}{2\\alpha L} \\left[ \\frac{x^3}{3} - \\frac{L^2}{4}x \\right]_{-L/2}^{L/2} $$\n$$ \\langle \\theta \\rangle = \\frac{\\beta}{2\\alpha L} \\left( 2 \\left( \\frac{(L/2)^3}{3} - \\frac{L^2}{4}\\frac{L}{2} \\right) \\right) = \\frac{\\beta}{\\alpha L} \\left( \\frac{L^3}{24} - \\frac{L^3}{8} \\right) = -\\frac{\\beta L^2}{12\\alpha} $$\nThe apparent peak occurs at a furnace temperature $T_{s,peak}$ such that $\\bar{T} = T_p$.\n$$ T_{s,peak} + \\langle \\theta \\rangle = T_p \\implies T_{s,peak} = T_p - \\langle \\theta \\rangle = T_p + \\frac{\\beta L^2}{12\\alpha} $$\nThe shift in the peak temperature is an upward shift, given by $\\Delta T_p = T_{s,peak} - T_p = \\frac{\\beta L^2}{12\\alpha}$.\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$ \\Delta T_p = \\frac{(\\frac{1}{6}\\,\\mathrm{K/s}) \\cdot (2.5\\,\\mathrm{mm})^2}{12 \\cdot (0.08\\,\\mathrm{mm^2/s})} = \\frac{6.25/6}{0.96}\\,\\mathrm{K} = \\frac{1.0416...}{0.96}\\,\\mathrm{K} \\approx 1.085\\,\\mathrm{K} $$\nThis corresponds to an upward shift of approximately $1.1\\,\\mathrm{K}$.\n\n**2) Additional Contribution to the FWHM**\n\nThe distribution of temperatures across the specimen thickness causes a broadening of the measured peak. The intrinsic peak shape is convoluted with the temperature distribution. For a sufficiently broad intrinsic peak, the variance of the observed peak is the sum of the intrinsic variance and the variance of the temperature distribution. The additional broadening is therefore characterized by the spread of the temperature profile. A standard measure for this spread is the variance $\\sigma_T^2$ of the temperature distribution $T(x)$.\n$$ \\sigma_T^2 = \\langle (T - \\bar{T})^2 \\rangle = \\langle (\\theta - \\langle \\theta \\rangle)^2 \\rangle = \\langle \\theta^2 \\rangle - \\langle \\theta \\rangle^2 $$\nFirst, we calculate $\\langle \\theta^2 \\rangle$:\n$$ \\langle \\theta^2 \\rangle = \\frac{1}{L} \\int_{-L/2}^{L/2} \\left[ \\frac{\\beta}{2\\alpha} \\left( x^2 - \\frac{L^2}{4} \\right) \\right]^2 \\,dx = \\frac{2}{L} \\left(\\frac{\\beta}{2\\alpha}\\right)^2 \\int_0^{L/2} \\left( x^4 - \\frac{L^2}{2}x^2 + \\frac{L^4}{16} \\right) \\,dx $$\n$$ \\langle \\theta^2 \\rangle = \\frac{\\beta^2}{2\\alpha^2 L} \\left[ \\frac{x^5}{5} - \\frac{L^2}{6}x^3 + \\frac{L^4}{16}x \\right]_0^{L/2} = \\frac{\\beta^2}{2\\alpha^2 L} \\left( \\frac{L^5}{160} - \\frac{L^5}{48} + \\frac{L^5}{32} \\right) = \\frac{\\beta^2 L^4}{2\\alpha^2} \\left( \\frac{3-10+15}{480} \\right) = \\frac{\\beta^2 L^4}{2\\alpha^2} \\frac{8}{480} = \\frac{\\beta^2 L^4}{120\\alpha^2} $$\nNow we can compute the variance:\n$$ \\sigma_T^2 = \\frac{\\beta^2 L^4}{120\\alpha^2} - \\left(-\\frac{\\beta L^2}{12\\alpha}\\right)^2 = \\frac{\\beta^2 L^4}{120\\alpha^2} - \\frac{\\beta^2 L^4}{144\\alpha^2} = \\frac{\\beta^2 L^4}{\\alpha^2} \\left(\\frac{1}{120} - \\frac{1}{144}\\right) = \\frac{\\beta^2 L^4}{\\alpha^2} \\left(\\frac{144-120}{120 \\cdot 144}\\right) = \\frac{\\beta^2 L^4}{720\\alpha^2} $$\nThe standard deviation of the temperature distribution is:\n$$ \\sigma_T = \\frac{\\beta L^2}{\\alpha\\sqrt{720}} = \\frac{(\\frac{1}{6}\\,\\mathrm{K/s}) \\cdot (2.5\\,\\mathrm{mm})^2}{(0.08\\,\\mathrm{mm^2/s}) \\cdot \\sqrt{720}} \\approx \\frac{1.0416...}{0.08 \\cdot 26.833}\\,\\mathrm{K} \\approx \\frac{1.0416...}{2.1466...}\\,\\mathrm{K} \\approx 0.4852\\,\\mathrm{K} $$\nThe problem asks for the additional contribution to the FWHM. A standard method to estimate this is to calculate the FWHM of a Gaussian distribution having the same variance as the temperature distribution. The FWHM of a Gaussian is related to its standard deviation $\\sigma$ by $\\text{FWHM} = 2\\sqrt{2\\ln 2} \\sigma \\approx 2.355 \\sigma$.\nThe additional FWHM, $\\Delta W$, due to thermal non-uniformity is thus:\n$$ \\Delta W \\approx 2.355 \\cdot \\sigma_T \\approx 2.355 \\cdot 0.4852\\,\\mathrm{K} \\approx 1.1426\\,\\mathrm{K} $$\nThis additional broadening is approximately $1.15\\,\\mathrm{K}$.\n\nOur calculated results are an upward shift of $\\approx 1.1\\,\\mathrm{K}$ and an additional FWHM of $\\approx 1.15\\,\\mathrm{K}$.\n\n**Option-by-Option Analysis**\n\n-   **A. Upward shift $\\approx 1.1\\,\\mathrm{K}$; additional FWHM $\\approx 1.15\\,\\mathrm{K}$.**\n    This option matches our derived values for both the peak shift ($\\approx 1.085\\,\\mathrm{K}$) and the additional FWHM ($\\approx 1.143\\,\\mathrm{K}$). The reasoning is physically and mathematically sound. **Correct**.\n\n-   **B. Upward shift $\\approx 1.6\\,\\mathrm{K}$; additional FWHM $\\approx 1.6\\,\\mathrm{K}$.**\n    The value of $1.6\\,\\mathrm{K}$ corresponds to the maximum temperature difference in the sample, $\\Delta T_{max} = -\\theta(0) = \\frac{\\beta L^2}{8\\alpha} \\approx 1.63\\,\\mathrm{K}$. This option arises from mistakenly using the maximum temperature lag for the average shift and using the total temperature range as the FWHM. Both are conceptually incorrect approximations. **Incorrect**.\n\n-   **C. Downward shift $\\approx 1.1\\,\\mathrm{K}$; additional FWHM $\\approx 0\\,\\mathrm{K}$.**\n    The shift is upward, not downward, because the sample is on average colder than the furnace. The broadening due to a finite temperature distribution cannot be zero. **Incorrect**.\n\n-   **D. Upward shift $\\approx 0.55\\,\\mathrm{K}$; additional FWHM $\\approx 0.49\\,\\mathrm{K}$.**\n    The shift value of $0.55\\,\\mathrm{K}$ is approximately half the correct value. The FWHM value of $0.49\\,\\mathrm{K}$ is approximately equal to the standard deviation $\\sigma_T$ of the temperature distribution, not the FWHM. FWHM is not equivalent to standard deviation. **Incorrect**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2880065"}]}
