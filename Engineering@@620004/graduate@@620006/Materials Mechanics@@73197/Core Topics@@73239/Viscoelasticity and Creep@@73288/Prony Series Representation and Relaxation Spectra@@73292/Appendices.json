The problem is scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, self-contained, and consistent. It is a standard derivation request, not trivial, and its solution is verifiable against established theory. Therefore, the problem is valid and a solution will be provided.\n\nThe solution proceeds in three parts as requested.\n\nPart 1: Derivation of the relaxation modulus for a single Maxwell element.\n\nA Maxwell element consists of a linear elastic spring with modulus $g$ and a Newtonian dashpot with viscosity $\\eta$ connected in series. For a series connection, the total strain $\\varepsilon(t)$ is the sum of the individual strains, and the stress $\\sigma(t)$ is the same in both components.\n\nThe strain additivity rule is:\n$$ \\varepsilon(t) = \\varepsilon_{\\text{spring}}(t) + \\varepsilon_{\\text{dashpot}}(t) $$\nThe stress equality rule is:\n$$ \\sigma(t) = \\sigma_{\\text{spring}}(t) = \\sigma_{\\text{dashpot}}(t) $$\nThe constitutive laws for the spring and dashpot are:\n$$ \\sigma_{\\text{spring}}(t) = g \\, \\varepsilon_{\\text{spring}}(t) $$\n$$ \\sigma_{\\text{dashpot}}(t) = \\eta \\, \\frac{d\\varepsilon_{\\text{dashpot}}(t)}{dt} = \\eta \\, \\dot{\\varepsilon}_{\\text{dashpot}}(t) $$\nFrom these relations, we express the strains in terms of the common stress $\\sigma(t)$:\n$$ \\varepsilon_{\\text{spring}}(t) = \\frac{\\sigma(t)}{g} $$\n$$ \\dot{\\varepsilon}_{\\text{dashpot}}(t) = \\frac{\\sigma(t)}{\\eta} $$\nDifferentiating the strain additivity equation with respect to time $t$ gives:\n$$ \\dot{\\varepsilon}(t) = \\dot{\\varepsilon}_{\\text{spring}}(t) + \\dot{\\varepsilon}_{\\text{dashpot}}(t) $$\nSubstituting the constitutive relations, we obtain the governing differential equation for the Maxwell element relating total stress $\\sigma(t)$ and total strain $\\varepsilon(t)$:\n$$ \\dot{\\varepsilon}(t) = \\frac{1}{g} \\dot{\\sigma}(t) + \\frac{1}{\\eta} \\sigma(t) $$\nWe are asked to solve this for a small step strain input $\\varepsilon(t) = \\varepsilon_{0} H(t)$, where $H(t)$ is the Heaviside step function and $\\varepsilon_{0}$ is a constant. For $t > 0$, $\\varepsilon(t) = \\varepsilon_{0}$, and thus its time derivative $\\dot{\\varepsilon}(t) = 0$. The differential equation simplifies to a homogeneous first-order linear ordinary differential equation for $\\sigma(t)$:\n$$ 0 = \\frac{1}{g} \\dot{\\sigma}(t) + \\frac{1}{\\eta} \\sigma(t) \\implies \\dot{\\sigma}(t) = -\\frac{g}{\\eta} \\sigma(t) $$\nWe define the relaxation time $\\tau = \\eta/g$. The equation becomes:\n$$ \\dot{\\sigma}(t) = -\\frac{1}{\\tau} \\sigma(t) $$\nThe general solution for $t > 0$ is $\\sigma(t) = C \\exp(-t/\\tau)$, where $C$ is a constant of integration.\nTo determine $C$, we find the initial stress $\\sigma(0^{+})$ at the moment just after the step strain is applied. At $t=0^{+}$, the dashpot, which resists the rate of strain, has not had time to deform, so $\\varepsilon_{\\text{dashpot}}(0^{+}) = 0$. The entire instantaneous strain is taken up by the spring: $\\varepsilon(0^{+}) = \\varepsilon_{\\text{spring}}(0^{+}) = \\varepsilon_{0}$. The initial stress is therefore determined solely by the spring's response:\n$$ \\sigma(0^{+}) = g \\, \\varepsilon_{\\text{spring}}(0^{+}) = g \\, \\varepsilon_{0} $$\nThus, the constant $C$ is $g \\varepsilon_{0}$. The stress relaxation for $t \\ge 0$ is:\n$$ \\sigma(t) = g \\, \\varepsilon_{0} \\exp(-t/\\tau) $$\nThe relaxation modulus $G(t)$ is defined as the stress response to a unit step strain, i.e., $\\sigma(t) = G(t) \\varepsilon_{0}$. Therefore, for a single Maxwell element, the relaxation modulus for $t \\ge 0$ is:\n$$ G(t) = g \\exp(-t/\\tau), \\quad \\text{with} \\quad \\tau = \\frac{\\eta}{g} $$\n\nPart 2: Derivation of the relaxation modulus for a parallel assembly.\n\nNow, consider $N$ Maxwell elements connected in parallel. For a parallel connection, the total strain $\\varepsilon(t)$ is the same across all elements, while the total stress $\\sigma(t)$ is the sum of the stresses in each element.\n\nThe strain equality rule is:\n$$ \\varepsilon(t) = \\varepsilon_{i}(t) \\quad \\text{for} \\quad i=1, 2, \\dots, N $$\nThe stress additivity rule is:\n$$ \\sigma(t) = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\sigma_{i}(t) $$\nEach element $i$ has parameters $(g_{i}, \\eta_{i})$ and a corresponding relaxation time $\\tau_{i} = \\eta_{i}/g_{i}$.\nWhen the assembly is subjected to a step strain $\\varepsilon(t) = \\varepsilon_{0} H(t)$, each element $i$ experiences this same strain. From Part 1, the stress response of element $i$ is:\n$$ \\sigma_{i}(t) = g_{i} \\, \\varepsilon_{0} \\exp(-t/\\tau_{i}) \\quad \\text{for} \\quad t \\ge 0 $$\nThe total stress is the sum of these individual stresses:\n$$ \\sigma(t) = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\sigma_{i}(t) = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} g_{i} \\, \\varepsilon_{0} \\exp(-t/\\tau_{i}) $$\nFactoring out $\\varepsilon_{0}$:\n$$ \\sigma(t) = \\left( \\sum_{i=1}^{N} g_{i} \\exp(-t/\\tau_{i}) \\right) \\varepsilon_{0} $$\nThe overall relaxation modulus $G(t)$ of the assembly is defined by $\\sigma(t) = G(t) \\varepsilon_{0}$. Therefore, the relaxation modulus for the parallel assembly for $t \\ge 0$ is:\n$$ G(t) = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} g_{i} \\exp(-t/\\tau_{i}) $$\nThis is a Prony series representation. The set of parameter pairs $\\{(g_{i}, \\tau_{i})\\}_{i=1}^{N}$ constitutes a finite discrete relaxation spectrum, where $g_{i}$ are the weights and $\\tau_{i}$ are the relaxation times.\n\nPart 3: Derivation of the complex modulus for the parallel assembly.\n\nThe Boltzmann superposition principle states that for a general causal strain history $\\varepsilon(t)$, the stress $\\sigma(t)$ is given by the convolution integral:\n$$ \\sigma(t) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{t} G(t-t') \\frac{d\\varepsilon(t')}{dt'} dt' $$\nWe consider a steady-state oscillatory strain, handled most conveniently using complex notation. Let the complex strain be $\\varepsilon_{c}(t) = \\hat{\\varepsilon} \\exp(\\mathrm{i} \\omega t)$. The physical strain is $\\varepsilon(t) = \\Re\\{\\varepsilon_{c}(t)\\}$. The corresponding complex stress is $\\sigma_{c}(t)$. For a linear time-invariant system, the output will also be oscillatory at the same frequency: $\\sigma_{c}(t) = G^{*}(\\omega) \\varepsilon_{c}(t)$, where $G^{*}(\\omega)$ is the complex modulus.\nThe complex strain rate is $\\dot{\\varepsilon}_{c}(t) = \\mathrm{i} \\omega \\hat{\\varepsilon} \\exp(\\mathrm{i} \\omega t)$. Substituting into the convolution integral:\n$$ \\sigma_{c}(t) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{t} G(t-t') \\left( \\mathrm{i} \\omega \\hat{\\varepsilon} \\exp(\\mathrm{i} \\omega t') \\right) dt' $$\nWe introduce a change of variable $s = t-t'$, which means $t' = t-s$ and $dt' = -ds$. The integration limits change from $t' \\in (-\\infty, t]$ to $s \\in [0, \\infty)$.\n$$ \\sigma_{c}(t) = \\int_{\\infty}^{0} G(s) \\left( \\mathrm{i} \\omega \\hat{\\varepsilon} \\exp(\\mathrm{i} \\omega (t-s)) \\right) (-ds) $$\n$$ \\sigma_{c}(t) = \\mathrm{i} \\omega \\hat{\\varepsilon} \\int_{0}^{\\infty} G(s) \\exp(\\mathrm{i} \\omega t - \\mathrm{i} \\omega s) ds $$\n$$ \\sigma_{c}(t) = \\left( \\mathrm{i} \\omega \\int_{0}^{\\infty} G(s) \\exp(-\\mathrm{i} \\omega s) ds \\right) \\hat{\\varepsilon} \\exp(\\mathrm{i} \\omega t) $$\nComparing this with the definition $\\sigma_{c}(t) = G^{*}(\\omega) \\hat{\\varepsilon} \\exp(\\mathrm{i} \\omega t)$, we identify the complex modulus as:\n$$ G^{*}(\\omega) = \\mathrm{i} \\omega \\int_{0}^{\\infty} G(t) \\exp(-\\mathrm{i} \\omega t) dt $$\nNow, we substitute the relaxation modulus for the parallel assembly, $G(t) = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} g_{i} \\exp(-t/\\tau_{i})$, into this expression.\n$$ G^{*}(\\omega) = \\mathrm{i} \\omega \\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\left( \\sum_{i=1}^{N} g_{i} \\exp(-t/\\tau_{i}) \\right) \\exp(-\\mathrm{i} \\omega t) dt $$\nAssuming uniform convergence, we can interchange summation and integration:\n$$ G^{*}(\\omega) = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} g_{i} \\left( \\mathrm{i} \\omega \\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\exp(-t/\\tau_{i}) \\exp(-\\mathrm{i} \\omega t) dt \\right) $$\n$$ G^{*}(\\omega) = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} g_{i} \\left( \\mathrm{i} \\omega \\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\exp\\left(-t\\left(\\frac{1}{\\tau_{i}} + \\mathrm{i} \\omega\\right)\\right) dt \\right) $$\nThe integral is evaluated as:\n$$ \\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\exp\\left(-t\\left(\\frac{1}{\\tau_{i}} + \\mathrm{i} \\omega\\right)\\right) dt = \\left[ \\frac{\\exp\\left(-t\\left(\\frac{1}{\\tau_{i}} + \\mathrm{i} \\omega\\right)\\right)}{-\\left(\\frac{1}{\\tau_{i}} + \\mathrm{i} \\omega\\right)} \\right]_{0}^{\\infty} $$\nSince $\\tau_{i} > 0$, the real part of the coefficient in the exponent is positive, so the expression evaluates to $0$ at the upper limit $t=\\infty$. At the lower limit $t=0$, the value is $1$. The integral becomes:\n$$ 0 - \\frac{1}{-\\left(\\frac{1}{\\tau_{i}} + \\mathrm{i} \\omega\\right)} = \\frac{1}{\\frac{1}{\\tau_{i}} + \\mathrm{i} \\omega} = \\frac{\\tau_{i}}{1 + \\mathrm{i} \\omega \\tau_{i}} $$\nSubstituting this result back into the expression for $G^{*}(\\omega)$:\n$$ G^{*}(\\omega) = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} g_{i} \\left( \\mathrm{i} \\omega \\frac{\\tau_{i}}{1 + \\mathrm{i} \\omega \\tau_{i}} \\right) $$\nThis gives the final closed-form expression for the complex modulus:\n$$ G^{*}(\\omega) = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} g_{i} \\frac{\\mathrm{i} \\omega \\tau_{i}}{1 + \\mathrm{i} \\omega \\tau_{i}} $$\nThis is the required expression in terms of $\\{g_{i}\\}$, $\\{\\tau_{i}\\}$, and $\\omega$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\sum_{i=1}^{N} g_{i} \\frac{\\mathrm{i} \\omega \\tau_{i}}{1 + \\mathrm{i} \\omega \\tau_{i}}}\n$$", "id": "2913303"}, {"introduction": "A powerful model is one that can predict material behavior under arbitrary loading conditions.

Standard rheological literature defines the instantaneous modulus as $G(t=0) = G_e + \\sum_{i} g_i$ and the equilibrium modulus as $G(t\\to\\infty) = G_e$, which corresponds to $G'(\\omega \\to 0)$. The problem refers to $G_{\\infty}$ as the \"instantaneous (glassy) modulus\" but includes it as an independent parameter in a way that makes it function mathematically as the equilibrium modulus, $G_e$. I will proceed by adopting the formulation that is consistent with the implied mathematical structure, while noting this discrepancy.\n\nThe foundation of linear viscoelasticity is the Boltzmann superposition principle, which expresses the stress $\\sigma(t)$ as a convolution of the relaxation modulus $G(t)$ with the history of the strain rate $\\dot{\\gamma}(t')$:\n$$\n\\sigma(t) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{t} G(t-t') \\dot{\\gamma}(t') dt'\n$$\nFor an oscillatory strain $\\gamma(t) = \\gamma_0 e^{i\\omega t}$, the stress response is also sinusoidal, $\\sigma(t) = \\sigma_0 e^{i\\omega t}$, defining the complex modulus $G^*(\\omega) = \\sigma(t)/\\gamma(t)$. Substituting the strain history into the superposition integral yields the complex modulus as the Fourier-Laplace transform of the relaxation modulus:\n$$\nG^*(\\omega) = i\\omega \\int_0^\\infty G(s) e^{-i\\omega s} ds\n$$\nThe generalized Maxwell model describes the relaxation modulus $G(t)$ with a Prony series. The standard form includes an equilibrium modulus $G_e$ for solid-like behavior at long times:\n$$\nG(t) = G_e + \\sum_{i=1}^{N} g_i e^{-t/\\tau_i}\n$$\nwhere $\\{g_i, \\tau_i\\}$ are the strengths and relaxation times of the $N$ Maxwell elements. Inserting this into the transform for $G^*(\\omega)$ and performing the integration leads to expressions for the storage modulus $G'(\\omega) = \\mathrm{Re}[G^*(\\omega)]$ and loss modulus $G''(\\omega) = \\mathrm{Im}[G^*(\\omega)]$. After accounting for the singularity from the constant $G_e$ term, the standard result is:\n$$\nG'(\\omega) = G_e + \\sum_{i=1}^{N} g_i \\frac{\\omega^2 \\tau_i^2}{1 + \\omega^2 \\tau_i^2}\n$$\n$$\nG''(\\omega) = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} g_i \\frac{\\omega \\tau_i}{1 + \\omega^2 \\tau_i^2}\n$$\nThe problem asks for a fit of parameters $\\{g_i\\}_{i=1}^{N}$ and a parameter labeled $G_{\\infty}$. Based on the linear structure required, we must assume the model forms are precisely the equations above, with $G_e$ being the parameter denoted as $G_{\\infty}$. This parameter represents the equilibrium modulus $G'(\\omega \\to 0)$, not the instantaneous modulus $G'(\\omega \\to \\infty) = G_e + \\sum g_i$. We will proceed under this necessary interpretation.\n\nThe task is to find the parameter vector $\\mathbf{x} = [g_1, g_2, \\dots, g_N, G_{\\infty}]^{\\mathsf{T}}$ from a set of $M$ measurements of storage modulus, $\\widehat{G}'(\\omega_m)$, and loss modulus, $\\widehat{G}''(\\omega_m)$, at frequencies $\\{\\omega_m\\}_{m=1}^{M}$. Both $G'(\\omega)$ and $G''(\\omega)$ are linear functions of the unknown parameters $\\{g_i, G_{\\infty}\\}$. This allows us to formulate the joint fit as a single linear system. We can stack the equations for all measured frequencies into a single matrix equation $\\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{x} \\approx \\mathbf{b}$.\n\nThe vector of observations $\\mathbf{b}$ is constructed by concatenating the $M$ storage modulus measurements and the $M$ loss modulus measurements:\n$$\n\\mathbf{b} = [\\widehat{G}'(\\omega_1), \\dots, \\widehat{G}'(\\omega_M), \\widehat{G}''(\\omega_1), \\dots, \\widehat{G}''(\\omega_M)]^{\\mathsf{T}}\n$$\nThis vector has dimensions $2M \\times 1$. The design matrix $\\mathbf{A}$ will have dimensions $2M \\times (N+1)$. The columns of $\\mathbf{A}$ are the partial derivatives of the model predictions with respect to the parameters in $\\mathbf{x}$. The structure of $\\mathbf{A}$ is as follows:\nFor the first $M$ rows, corresponding to $G'(\\omega_m)$:\n$$\nA_{m,j} = \\frac{\\omega_m^2 \\tau_j^2}{1 + \\omega_m^2 \\tau_j^2} \\quad \\text{for } j=1, \\dots, N \\quad \\text{ (coefficients for } g_j \\text{)}\n$$\n$$\nA_{m, N+1} = 1 \\quad \\text{ (coefficient for } G_{\\infty} \\text{)}\n$$\nFor the next $M$ rows (i.e., row index $M+m$), corresponding to $G''(\\omega_m)$:\n$$\nA_{M+m,j} = \\frac{\\omega_m \\tau_j}{1 + \\omega_m^2 \\tau_j^2} \\quad \\text{for } j=1, \\dots, N \\quad \\text{ (coefficients for } g_j \\text{)}\n$$\n$$\nA_{M+m, N+1} = 0 \\quad \\text{ (coefficient for } G_{\\infty} \\text{)}\n$$\nThe physical requirement that modal strengths $g_i$ and the equilibrium modulus $G_{\\infty}$ must be non-negative imposes the constraint $\\mathbf{x} \\ge \\mathbf{0}$. The problem thus becomes a Non-Negative Least Squares (NNLS) optimization problem:\n$$\n\\min_{\\mathbf{x} \\ge \\mathbf{0}}\\ \\lVert \\mathbf{A}\\mathbf{x} - \\mathbf{b} \\rVert_{2}^{2}\n$$\nThis is a convex optimization problem for which robust and efficient algorithms exist, such as the active-set method implemented in `scipy.optimize.nnls`.\n\nThe implementation will proceed as follows for each test case:\n1.  The true parameters $\\mathbf{g}^{\\mathrm{true}}$ and $G_{\\infty}^{\\mathrm{true}}$ are used to generate synthetic, noiseless data vectors $\\widehat{G}'(\\boldsymbol{\\omega})$ and $\\widehat{G}''(\\boldsymbol{\\omega})$, which are then stacked into the observation vector $\\mathbf{b}$.\n2.  The design matrix $\\mathbf{A}$ is constructed based on the fitting relaxation times $\\boldsymbol{\\tau}$ and measurement frequencies $\\boldsymbol{\\omega}$.\n3.  The NNLS problem is solved to find the estimated parameter vector $\\widehat{\\mathbf{x}}$.\n4.  The relative error $\\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{rel}} = \\lVert \\widehat{\\mathbf{x}} - \\mathbf{x}^{\\mathrm{true}} \\rVert_{2} / \\lVert \\mathbf{x}^{\\mathrm{true}} \\rVert_{2}$ is computed.\n5.  Success is declared if $\\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{rel}} \\le 10^{-8}$.\n\nThis procedure directly tests the ability of the NNLS formulation to correctly invert the linear model in the absence of noise, including for cases with zero-valued parameters and over-parameterization.", "answer": "```python\n# The complete and runnable Python 3 code goes here.\n# Imports must adhere to the specified execution environment.\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy.optimize import nnls\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Constructs and solves the joint non-negative least-squares problem for\n    fitting a generalized Maxwell model to synthetic viscoelastic data.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    test_cases = [\n        {\n            \"tau_fit\": np.array([0.01, 0.2, 5.0]),\n            \"g_true\": np.array([2.5e6, 1.0e6, 0.5e6]),\n            \"G_inf_true\": 0.8e6,\n            \"omega\": np.logspace(-1, 3, 25),\n        },\n        {\n            \"tau_fit\": np.array([0.05, 5.0]),\n            \"g_true\": np.array([3.0e5, 7.0e5]),\n            \"G_inf_true\": 0.0,\n            \"omega\": np.array([0., 0.01, 0.1, 1., 10., 100.]),\n        },\n        {\n            \"tau_fit\": np.array([0.01, 0.1, 1.0, 10.0, 100.0]),\n            \"g_true\": np.array([0.0, 1.2e5, 0.0, 2.8e5, 0.0]),\n            \"G_inf_true\": 0.0,\n            \"omega\": np.logspace(-2, 3, 30),\n        }\n    ]\n\n    results = []\n    tolerance = 1e-8\n\n    for case in test_cases:\n        tau_fit = case[\"tau_fit\"]\n        g_true = case[\"g_true\"]\n        G_inf_true = case[\"G_inf_true\"]\n        omega = case[\"omega\"]\n\n        N = len(tau_fit)\n        M = len(omega)\n\n        # 1.
