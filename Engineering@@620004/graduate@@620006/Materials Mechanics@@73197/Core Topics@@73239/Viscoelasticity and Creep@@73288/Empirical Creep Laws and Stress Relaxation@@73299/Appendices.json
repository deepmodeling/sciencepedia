The element consists of a Hookean spring and a Newtonian dashpot arranged in parallel.\n\nFor a parallel arrangement, the strain $\\varepsilon(t)$ is identical for both components, while the total stress $\\sigma(t)$ is the sum of the individual stresses.\n$$\n\\varepsilon(t) = \\varepsilon_{\\text{spring}}(t) = \\varepsilon_{\\text{dashpot}}(t)\n$$\n$$\n\\sigma(t) = \\sigma_{\\text{spring}}(t) + \\sigma_{\\text{dashpot}}(t)\n$$\nThe constitutive relations for the linear spring and dashpot are given respectively as:\n$$\n\\sigma_{\\text{spring}}(t) = E \\varepsilon_{\\text{spring}}(t) = E \\varepsilon(t)\n$$\n$$\n\\sigma_{\\text{dashpot}}(t) = \\eta \\frac{d\\varepsilon_{\\text{dashpot}}(t)}{dt} = \\eta \\frac{d\\varepsilon(t)}{dt}\n$$\nwhere $E$ is the elastic modulus and $\\eta$ is the viscosity. Combining these relations gives the governing constitutive equation for the Kelvin窶天oigt model:\n$$\n\\sigma(t) = E \\varepsilon(t) + \\eta \\frac{d\\varepsilon(t)}{dt}\n$$\nThis equation forms the basis for all subsequent analysis.\n\n(a) We are to argue why a classical stress relaxation test, characterized by an instantaneous step strain $\\varepsilon(t) = \\varepsilon_{0} H(t)$, is not admissible. Here, $\\varepsilon_{0} > 0$ is a constant and $H(t)$ is the Heaviside step function.\n\nTo determine the stress response, we first find the strain rate by differentiating the strain history:\n$$\n\\frac{d\\varepsilon(t)}{dt} = \\frac{d}{dt} \\left( \\varepsilon_{0} H(t) \\right) = \\varepsilon_{0} \\frac{dH(t)}{dt} = \\varepsilon_{0} \\delta(t)\n$$\nwhere $\\delta(t)$ is the Dirac delta function, which represents an infinite impulse at $t=0$.\n\nSubstituting the expressions for $\\varepsilon(t)$ and its derivative into the constitutive equation gives the stress response:\n$$\n\\sigma(t) = E (\\varepsilon_{0} H(t)) + \\eta (\\varepsilon_{0} \\delta(t)) = E \\varepsilon_{0} H(t) + \\eta \\varepsilon_{0} \\delta(t)\n$$\nThe stress response contains two parts: a step increase in stress of magnitude $E \\varepsilon_{0}$ for $t>0$ due to the spring, and a Dirac delta impulse of magnitude $\\eta \\varepsilon_{0}$ at $t=0$ due to the dashpot. A stress impulse of the form $\\delta(t)$ corresponds to an infinite stress at a single instant in time. Such a condition is physically impossible to generate or sustain in a real material or experimental apparatus. It implies an infinite force applied over an infinitesimally small time, which would require an infinite rate of work, i.e., infinite power. The physical reason for this mathematical pathology is that the dashpot, being parallel to the spring, must undergo the same instantaneous strain. A Newtonian dashpot resists a rate of strain with a proportional stress. An infinite strain rate (implied by an instantaneous strain step) thus requires an infinite resistive stress from the dashpot. Consequently, the ideal stress relaxation test is not a physically meaningful or admissible scenario for the Kelvin窶天oigt model.\n\n(b) To derive the stress response $\\sigma(t)$ for the given finite ramp strain history, we analyze the problem in the two specified time intervals.\n\nInterval 1: $0 \\le t \\le T_{r}$ (Ramp phase)\nIn this interval, the strain is given by a linear ramp:\n$$\n\\varepsilon(t) = \\varepsilon_{f} \\frac{t}{T_{r}}\n$$\nThe strain rate is constant:\n$$\n\\frac{d\\varepsilon(t)}{dt} = \\frac{d}{dt} \\left( \\varepsilon_{f} \\frac{t}{T_{r}} \\right) = \\frac{\\varepsilon_{f}}{T_{r}}\n$$\nSubstituting these into the constitutive equation yields the stress response during the ramp:\n$$\n\\sigma(t) = E \\left( \\varepsilon_{f} \\frac{t}{T_{r}} \\right) + \\eta \\left( \\frac{\\varepsilon_{f}}{T_{r}} \\right) = \\frac{\\varepsilon_{f}}{T_{r}} (E t + \\eta)\n$$\n\nInterval 2: $t \\ge T_{r}$ (Hold phase)\nIn this interval, the strain is held constant at its final value:\n$$\n\\varepsilon(t) = \\varepsilon_{f}\n$$\nThe strain rate is therefore zero for $t > T_{r}$:\n$$\n\\frac{d\\varepsilon(t)}{dt} = 0\n$$\nSubstituting these into the constitutive equation gives the stress response after the ramp:\n$$\n\\sigma(t) = E (\\varepsilon_{f}) + \\eta (0) = E \\varepsilon_{f}\n$$\nCombining the results for both intervals, the complete stress response for all $t \\ge 0$ can be written as a piecewise function. Note that the derivative of strain, $\\dot{\\varepsilon}(t)$, is discontinuous at $t=T_r$, transitioning from $\\varepsilon_f/T_r$ to $0$. This causes a discontinuity in the stress $\\sigma(t)$.

It describes a standard problem in the mechanics of materials, specifically the study of creep. The concepts of true stress, true strain, constant volume deformation, and power-law creep are foundational principles in this field. The assumptions provided, such as $n > 1$ and constant volume, are physically realistic for metals at high temperatures. The problem is self-contained and provides all necessary information for a rigorous qualitative analysis. There are no contradictions, ambiguities, or factual errors.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict**\nThe problem is valid. We proceed to the solution.\n\n**Derivation of Governing Relationships**\nLet $L(t)$ and $A(t)$ be the instantaneous length and cross-sectional area of the specimen, respectively. The initial state is defined by $L_0$ and $A_0$.\n\nThe definition of true axial strain is:\n$$ \\varepsilon(t) = \\int_{L_0}^{L(t)} \\frac{dL}{L} = \\ln\\left(\\frac{L(t)}{L_0}\\right) $$\nThis implies $L(t) = L_0 e^{\\varepsilon(t)}$.\n\nThe assumption of constant volume during plastic deformation states that $A(t)L(t) = A_0L_0$. We can express the instantaneous area $A(t)$ in terms of the true strain $\\varepsilon(t)$:\n$$ A(t) = A_0 \\frac{L_0}{L(t)} = A_0 \\frac{L_0}{L_0 e^{\\varepsilon(t)}} = A_0 e^{-\\varepsilon(t)} $$\nThis relationship is fundamental to our analysis.\n\nThe definition of true stress is $\\sigma(t) = F(t)/A(t)$, where $F(t)$ is the instantaneous applied load.\n\nThe secondary creep stage is governed by the power law:\n$$ \\dot{\\varepsilon}(t) = \\frac{d\\varepsilon}{dt} = B \\sigma(t)^n $$\nwhere $B$ is a temperature-dependent material constant and $n > 1$ is the stress exponent.\n\n**Analysis of Test 1: Constant Load**\nIn this test, the applied load is held constant at its initial value, $F(t) = F_0$. The initial true stress is $\\sigma_0 = F_0/A_0$. The true stress at any time $t$ is:\n$$ \\sigma(t) = \\frac{F_0}{A(t)} = \\frac{F_0}{A_0 e^{-\\varepsilon(t)}} = \\left(\\frac{F_0}{A_0}\\right) e^{\\varepsilon(t)} = \\sigma_0 e^{\\varepsilon(t)} $$\nAs the specimen creeps, it elongates, so $L(t) > L_0$ and the true strain $\\varepsilon(t) > 0$. Consequently, $e^{\\varepsilon(t)} > 1$. This means that in a constant load test, the true stress $\\sigma(t)$ continuously *increases* from its initial value $\\sigma_0$ as the specimen's cross-sectional area decreases.\n\nThe creep strain rate is then:\n$$ \\dot{\\varepsilon}(t) = B \\sigma(t)^n = B (\\sigma_0 e^{\\varepsilon(t)})^n = B \\sigma_0^n e^{n\\varepsilon(t)} $$\nSince $\\varepsilon(t)$ increases with time and $n > 1$, the term $e^{n\\varepsilon(t)}$ grows, causing the strain rate $\\dot{\\varepsilon}(t)$ to accelerate. This creates a positive feedback loop: strain increases the true stress, which in turn increases the strain rate, leading to even faster straining. This geometric softening effect causes an acceleration of creep even before significant microstructural damage (the typical cause of tertiary creep) accumulates. Therefore, the secondary stage is not a true steady state, and the transition to the tertiary stage is hastened.\n\n**Analysis of Test 2: Constant True Stress**\nIn this test, the true stress is maintained constant, $\\sigma(t) = \\sigma_0$.\nThe creep strain rate during the secondary stage is therefore constant:\n$$ \\dot{\\varepsilon}(t) = B \\sigma_0^n = \\text{constant} $$\nThis represents a true steady-state creep condition. The strain increases linearly with time, $\\varepsilon(t) = (B \\sigma_0^n) t + \\varepsilon_{primary}$.\n\nTo maintain a constant true stress, the applied load $F(t)$ must be continuously adjusted. From the definition of true stress:\n$$ F(t) = \\sigma(t) A(t) = \\sigma_0 A(t) = \\sigma_0 (A_0 e^{-\\varepsilon(t)}) $$\nAs the specimen elongates and $\\varepsilon(t)$ increases, the term $e^{-\\varepsilon(t)}$ decreases. Thus, the applied load $F(t)$ must be *reduced* over time.\n\nIn this scenario, the geometric acceleration seen in Test 1 is eliminated. The creep rate remains constant during the secondary stage, and this stage is prolonged. The onset of tertiary creep is then governed primarily by the intrinsic accumulation of material damage (e.g., void formation, micro-cracking), rather than being accelerated by an increasing stress.\n\n**Evaluation of Options**\n\n**A. In the constant load test, the true stress decreases with time because the cross-sectional area grows, so the secondary stage lasts longer than under constant true stress.**\n- \"true stress decreases with time\": This is false. As shown, $\\sigma(t) = \\sigma_0 e^{\\varepsilon(t)}$, which increases.\n- \"because the cross-sectional area grows\": This is false. In tension, the area decreases.\n- \"the secondary stage lasts longer\": This is false. Acceleration shortens the secondary stage.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**B. At fixed temperature with $n>1$, the constant load test tends to enter tertiary creep sooner than the constant true stress test because the true stress increases with axial strain and the creep rate accelerates even before microstructural damage dominates.**\nThis statement correctly identifies that in a constant load test, true stress increases as strain accumulates ($\\sigma(t) = \\sigma_0 e^{\\varepsilon(t)}$). This leads to an acceleration of the creep rate ($\\dot{\\varepsilon} \\propto \\sigma^n$), which drives the system into the tertiary stage more quickly than in a constant true stress test where such geometric acceleration is absent. The reasoning is entirely consistent with our derivation.\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\n**C. Under constant true stress, the externally applied load must be reduced over time to maintain $\\sigma(t)=\\sigma_0$; consequently the secondary stage is prolonged and may remain nearly steady until damage initiates.**\nThis statement correctly describes the requirements and consequences of a constant true stress test. The load must be reduced as $F(t) = \\sigma_0 A_0 e^{-\\varepsilon(t)}$ to compensate for the shrinking area. This eliminates the geometric acceleration, resulting in a true steady-state (constant $\\dot{\\varepsilon}$) secondary stage, which is thus prolonged compared to the constant load case. The transition to tertiary creep is then dictated by the slower process of damage accumulation.\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\n**D. The time to the onset of tertiary creep is essentially independent of whether the test is conducted at constant load or constant true stress because stress history does not affect damage evolution in power-law creep.**\nThis is incorrect. The analyses of Test 1 and Test 2 explicitly show that the evolution of strain and strain rate are fundamentally different. The time to reach a critical strain or a state of instability (tertiary creep) is significantly shorter under constant load due to the accelerating true stress. The premise that \"stress history does not affect damage evolution\" is also an oversimplification and generally false; higher stresses and strain rates typically accelerate damage mechanisms.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**E. Increasing the stress exponent $n$ amplifies the difference between the two tests, making the onset of tertiary creep relatively earlier under constant load compared with constant true stress, all else equal.**\nThe strain rate in the constant load test is $\\dot{\\varepsilon}(t) = B \\sigma_0^n e^{n\\varepsilon(t)}$. The term causing acceleration relative to the constant stress test is $e^{n\\varepsilon(t)}$. For a given strain $\\varepsilon$, a larger value of the exponent $n$ results in a much larger value of $e^{n\\varepsilon(t)}$. This means the positive feedback loop (strain $\\rightarrow$ stress $\\rightarrow$ strain rate) is significantly stronger for materials with a higher stress exponent. The creep rate accelerates much more dramatically, leading to a much more rapid entry into the tertiary stage. Therefore, increasing $n$ enhances the disparity between the two test types, making the constant-load test fail relatively faster.\nVerdict: **Correct**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{BCE}$$", "id": "2883414"}, {"introduction": "The analysis of this problem begins with the validation of the provided statement.
