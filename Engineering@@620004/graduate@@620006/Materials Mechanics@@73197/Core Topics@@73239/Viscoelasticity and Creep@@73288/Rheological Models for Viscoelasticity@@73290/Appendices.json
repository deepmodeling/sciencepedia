It is scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and internally consistent. It provides all necessary definitions, constitutive laws, and loading conditions to derive a unique and meaningful solution. Therefore, the problem is valid. We proceed with the analysis of each model under the specified loading conditions.\n\nThe analysis hinges on the behavior of the spring and dashpot elements at the instant of loading, $t=0$. An ideal spring responds instantaneously to stress with a change in strain ($\\sigma_s=E\\epsilon_s$), and to an instantaneous change in strain with a proportional stress. An ideal dashpot resists an instantaneous change in strain. A finite stress can only produce a finite strain rate ($\\sigma_d=\\eta\\dot{\\epsilon}_d$). Therefore, for the dashpot strain $\\epsilon_d$ to jump discontinuously at $t=0$, the strain rate $\\dot{\\epsilon}_d$ would have to be infinite (a Dirac delta impulse), which in turn would require an infinite (impulsive) stress $\\sigma_d$. Conversely, a finite, step-like stress $\\sigma_d$ can only produce a finite strain rate, meaning the strain $\\epsilon_d$ must be continuous and start from zero.\n\nWe analyze the two models for the two loading cases. Initial conditions are $\\sigma(t)=0$ and $\\epsilon(t)=0$ for all $t<0$.\n\n**1. Maxwell Element Analysis**\n\nThe governing equations for the Maxwell element (series connection) are:\n- Stress is common: $\\sigma(t) = \\sigma_s(t) = \\sigma_d(t)$\n- Strain is additive: $\\epsilon(t) = \\epsilon_s(t) + \\epsilon_d(t)$\n\nTaking the time derivative of the strain equation gives $\\dot{\\epsilon}(t) = \\dot{\\epsilon}_s(t) + \\dot{\\epsilon}_d(t)$. Using the constitutive laws, $\\sigma_s = E\\epsilon_s \\implies \\dot{\\epsilon}_s = \\frac{1}{E}\\dot{\\sigma}_s$ and $\\sigma_d = \\eta\\dot{\\epsilon}_d \\implies \\dot{\\epsilon}_d = \\frac{1}{\\eta}\\sigma_d$.\nSince stress is common, we obtain the constitutive equation for the Maxwell model:\n$$ \\dot{\\epsilon}(t) = \\frac{\\dot{\\sigma}(t)}{E} + \\frac{\\sigma(t)}{\\eta} $$\n\n**Case 1.1: Step Stress on Maxwell Element**\nThe applied stress is $\\sigma(t) = \\sigma_0 H(t)$, where $H(t)$ is the Heaviside step function. The time derivative is $\\dot{\\sigma}(t) = \\sigma_0 \\delta(t)$, where $\\delta(t)$ is the Dirac delta function.\nSubstituting these into the constitutive equation:\n$$ \\dot{\\epsilon}(t) = \\frac{\\sigma_0 \\delta(t)}{E} + \\frac{\\sigma_0 H(t)}{\\eta} $$\nTo find the strain $\\epsilon(t)$, we integrate $\\dot{\\epsilon}(t)$ from an infinitesimal time before zero, $t=0^-$, to any time $t>0$. The jump in strain at $t=0$ is $\\Delta \\epsilon = \\epsilon(0^+) - \\epsilon(0^-)$. Since $\\epsilon(0^-)=0$:\n$$ \\epsilon(0^+) = \\int_{0^-}^{0^+} \\dot{\\epsilon}(t') dt' = \\int_{0^-}^{0^+} \\left( \\frac{\\sigma_0 \\delta(t')}{E} + \\frac{\\sigma_0 H(t')}{\\eta} \\right) dt' $$\nThe integral of the Dirac delta function is $1$, and the integral of the Heaviside term over an infinitesimal interval $[0^-, 0^+]$ is $0$.\n$$ \\epsilon(0^+) = \\frac{\\sigma_0}{E} \\int_{0^-}^{0^+} \\delta(t') dt' + 0 = \\frac{\\sigma_0}{E} $$\nThus, under a step stress, the Maxwell element exhibits an instantaneous strain jump of magnitude $\\Delta \\epsilon = \\sigma_0/E$. This corresponds to the instantaneous elastic response of the spring.\n\n**Case 1.2: Step Strain on Maxwell Element**\nThe applied strain is $\\epsilon(t) = \\epsilon_0 H(t)$, so $\\dot{\\epsilon}(t) = \\epsilon_0 \\delta(t)$.\nWe rearrange the Maxwell constitutive equation to solve for stress:\n$$ \\dot{\\sigma}(t) + \\frac{E}{\\eta}\\sigma(t) = E\\dot{\\epsilon}(t) = E \\epsilon_0 \\delta(t) $$\nTo find the jump in stress at $t=0$, we integrate this equation from $t=0^-$ to $t=0^+$:\n$$ \\int_{0^-}^{0^+} \\dot{\\sigma}(t') dt' + \\frac{E}{\\eta} \\int_{0^-}^{0^+} \\sigma(t') dt' = E \\epsilon_0 \\int_{0^-}^{0^+} \\delta(t') dt' $$\n$$ [\\sigma(0^+) - \\sigma(0^-)] + 0 = E \\epsilon_0 $$\nSince the initial stress $\\sigma(0^-)=0$, we find the stress at $t=0^+$:\n$$ \\sigma(0^+) = E \\epsilon_0 $$\nThis shows a finite jump in stress. There is no Dirac delta impulse in the stress response. For $t>0$, the stress relaxes according to $\\dot{\\sigma} + (E/\\eta)\\sigma = 0$. The instantaneous response $\\sigma(0^+)$ is purely from the spring, which must strain by $\\epsilon_0$ at $t=0^+$ since the dashpot cannot strain instantaneously ($\\epsilon_d(0^+)=0$).\n\n**2. Kelvin–Voigt Element Analysis**\n\nThe governing equations for the Kelvin–Voigt element (parallel connection) are:\n- Strain is common: $\\epsilon(t) = \\epsilon_s(t) = \\epsilon_d(t)$\n- Stress is additive: $\\sigma(t) = \\sigma_s(t) + \\sigma_d(t)$\n\nSubstituting the constitutive laws gives the governing differential equation for the model:\n$$ \\sigma(t) = E\\epsilon(t) + \\eta\\dot{\\epsilon}(t) $$\n\n**Case 2.1: Step Stress on Kelvin–Voigt Element**\nThe applied stress is $\\sigma(t) = \\sigma_0 H(t)$.\nThe equation is $\\sigma_0 H(t) = E\\epsilon(t) + \\eta\\dot{\\epsilon}(t)$.\nLet us test for a discontinuity in strain. If $\\epsilon(t)$ were to jump by an amount $\\Delta\\epsilon = \\epsilon(0^+)$ at $t=0$, then $\\epsilon(t)$ would contain a term $\\Delta\\epsilon H(t)$, and its derivative $\\dot{\\epsilon}(t)$ would contain an impulsive term $\\Delta\\epsilon \\delta(t)$.\nSubstituting this into the governing equation would give:\n$$ \\sigma_0 H(t) = E(\\Delta\\epsilon H(t) + \\dots) + \\eta(\\Delta\\epsilon \\delta(t) + \\dots) $$\nThe left-hand side has no Dirac delta impulse term. For the equation to be valid, the coefficient of the $\\delta(t)$ term on the right-hand side must be zero. This requires $\\eta \\Delta\\epsilon = 0$. Given $\\eta \\neq 0$, it must be that $\\Delta\\epsilon = 0$.\nTherefore, the strain $\\epsilon(t)$ must be continuous at $t=0$. Since $\\epsilon(0^-)=0$, we must have $\\epsilon(0^+)=0$. The strain then evolves smoothly for $t>0$ according to the solution of $\\eta\\dot{\\epsilon} + E\\epsilon = \\sigma_0$, which is $\\epsilon(t) = (\\sigma_0/E)(1 - e^{-Et/\\eta})$.\n\n**Case 2.2: Step Strain on Kelvin–Voigt Element**\nThe applied strain is $\\epsilon(t) = \\epsilon_0 H(t)$, so $\\dot{\\epsilon}(t) = \\epsilon_0 \\delta(t)$.\nWe substitute these directly into the Kelvin–Voigt stress equation:\n$$ \\sigma(t) = E\\epsilon(t) + \\eta\\dot{\\epsilon}(t) = E (\\epsilon_0 H(t)) + \\eta (\\epsilon_0 \\delta(t)) $$\nThis result shows that the stress response $\\sigma(t)$ is composed of two parts:\n1.  A Dirac delta impulse at $t=0$ of strength (magnitude) $\\eta\\epsilon_0$. This is the impulsive stress from the dashpot required to enforce the instantaneous strain jump.\n2.  A step function component, $E\\epsilon_0 H(t)$, which represents a finite stress jump at $t=0$ that is sustained for $t>0$. This is the stress from the spring being held at a constant strain $\\epsilon_0$.\nThe total stress response contains both an impulse and a finite jump.\n\n**Evaluation of Options**\n\n**A. Maxwell element: Under a step stress $\\sigma(t)=\\sigma_{0}\\,H(t)$, the total strain $\\epsilon(t)$ exhibits a finite jump at $t=0^{+}$ of magnitude $\\Delta \\epsilon = \\sigma_{0}/E$. Under a step strain $\\epsilon(t)=\\epsilon_{0}\\,H(t)$, the stress $\\sigma(t)$ exhibits a finite jump at $t=0^{+}$ to $\\sigma(0^{+}) = E\\,\\epsilon_{0}$, with no stress impulse required.**\n- The first part is consistent with our analysis in Case 1.1.\n- The second part is consistent with our analysis in Case 1.2.\n- Verdict: **Correct**.\n\n**B. Kelvin–Voigt element: Under a step stress $\\sigma(t)=\\sigma_{0}\\,H(t)$, the strain $\\epsilon(t)$ is continuous at $t=0$ with $\\epsilon(0^{+})=0$ and evolves smoothly thereafter. Under a step strain $\\epsilon(t)=\\epsilon_{0}\\,H(t)$, the stress $\\sigma(t)$ necessarily contains a Dirac delta impulse at $t=0$ of strength $\\eta\\,\\epsilon_{0}$ in addition to a finite jump $E\\,\\epsilon_{0}$.**\n- The first part is consistent with our analysis in Case 2.1.\n- The second part is consistent with our analysis in Case 2.2. The term \"finite jump $E\\,\\epsilon_{0}$\" correctly describes the effect of the $E\\epsilon_0 H(t)$ term at $t=0^+$.\n- Verdict: **Correct**.\n\n**C.

This statement is incorrect on multiple points.\n- Verdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. Kelvin–Voigt element: Under a step stress $\\sigma(t)=\\sigma_{0}\\,H(t)$, the immediate response is an instantaneous strain jump $\\Delta \\epsilon = \\sigma_{0}/E$ at $t=0^{+}$ because the spring in parallel carries the full load at the instant of application.**\n- Our analysis in Case 2.1 proved that for the Kelvin–Voigt model under step stress, the strain is continuous, i.e., there is no instantaneous strain jump.\n- The reasoning is also flawed. The dashpot, being in parallel, must undergo the same strain and its resistance to instantaneous deformation prevents the entire element from straining at $t=0^+$. At $t=0^+$, the strain is zero, so the spring carries zero stress. The dashpot must carry the entire load $\\sigma_0$ (as a finite stress, supporting a finite strain rate).\n- Verdict: **Incorrect**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{AB}$$", "id": "2913969"}, {"introduction": "Building on the basics of step responses, this practice advances your analytical skills by considering a time-dependent loading scenario—a stress ramp.

The constitutive relations for the individual components are:\n1.  Linear spring (Hookean): $\\sigma(t) = E \\epsilon_s(t)$\n2.  Newtonian dashpot: $\\sigma(t) = \\eta \\frac{d\\epsilon_d(t)}{dt} = \\eta \\dot{\\epsilon}_d(t)$\n\nTo derive the governing ordinary differential equation (ODE) for the total strain $\\epsilon(t)$, we first differentiate the total strain equation with respect to time $t$:\n$$ \\dot{\\epsilon}(t) = \\dot{\\epsilon}_s(t) + \\dot{\\epsilon}_d(t) $$\nWe then express the strain rates $\\dot{\\epsilon}_s(t)$ and $\\dot{\\epsilon}_d(t)$ in terms of the stress $\\sigma(t)$ and its time derivative $\\dot{\\sigma}(t)$.\nFrom the spring's constitutive law:\n$$ \\epsilon_s(t) = \\frac{\\sigma(t)}{E} \\implies \\dot{\\epsilon}_s(t) = \\frac{\\dot{\\sigma}(t)}{E} $$\nFrom the dashpot's constitutive law:\n$$ \\dot{\\epsilon}_d(t) = \\frac{\\sigma(t)}{\\eta} $$\nSubstituting these expressions for the strain rates into the equation for $\\dot{\\epsilon}(t)$ yields the governing ODE for the Maxwell model:\n$$ \\dot{\\epsilon}(t) = \\frac{\\dot{\\sigma}(t)}{E} + \\frac{\\sigma(t)}{\\eta} $$\nThis is a first-order linear non-homogeneous ordinary differential equation for $\\epsilon(t)$.\n\nThe applied stress is given by $\\sigma(t) = \\alpha t H(t)$, where $H(t)$ is the Heaviside step function.

For each test case, the “measured” $G(t)$ is generated exactly from the given ground-truth parameters on the specified time grid; you must fit only the coefficients $g_k$ and $G_{\\infty}$ using the provided relaxation time grid, then compute $E^*(\\omega)$ using the fitted parameters.\n\nCommon instructions for all cases:\n- For each case, construct an evenly spaced time grid with $M = 400$ points from $t = 0$ to $t = T_{\\max}$, where $T_{\\max} = 1 + 5 \\max_k \\tau_k$, expressed in $\\mathrm{s}$.\n- The fitting grid of relaxation times is exactly the list of $\\{\\tau_k\\}$ given for the case.\n- Use nonnegative linear least squares to fit the vector of unknowns $\\mathbf{x} = [g_1, \\dots, g_N, G_{\\infty}]^\\top$ from the linear model $G(t_j) \\approx \\sum_{k=1}^N g_k \\exp(-t_j/\\tau_k) + G_{\\infty}$.\n\nTest Case $1$ (happy path, single branch with equilibrium):\n- Ground truth: $G_{\\infty} = 200\\,\\mathrm{MPa}$, one branch with $g_1 = 800\\,\\mathrm{MPa}$ and $\\tau_1 = 0.5\\,\\mathrm{s}$.\n- Poisson’s ratio: $\\nu = 0.33$.\n- Angular frequencies: $\\omega_a = 1\\,\\mathrm{rad/s}$ and $\\omega_b = 10\\,\\mathrm{rad/s}$.\n- Fitting grid: $\\{\\tau_1\\}$.\n\nTest Case $2$ (two distinct time scales, nonzero equilibrium):\n- Ground truth: $G_{\\infty} = 100\\,\\mathrm{MPa}$, two branches with $g_1 = 400\\,\\mathrm{MPa}$, $\\tau_1 = 0.01\\,\\mathrm{s}$ and $g_2 = 500\\,\\mathrm{MPa}$, $\\tau_2 = 1.0\\,\\mathrm{s}$.\n- Poisson’s ratio: $\\nu = 0.30$.\n- Angular frequencies: $\\omega_a = 1\\,\\mathrm{rad/s}$ and $\\omega_b = 100\\,\\mathrm{rad/s}$.\n- Fitting grid: $\\{\\tau_1, \\tau_2\\}$.\n\nTest Case $3$ (no equilibrium, widely separated time scales):\n- Ground truth: $G_{\\infty} = 0\\,\\mathrm{MPa}$, two branches with $g_1 = 1000\\,\\mathrm{MPa}$, $\\tau_1 = 10\\,\\mathrm{s}$ and $g_2 = 500\\,\\mathrm{MPa}$, $\\tau_2 = 0.1\\,\\mathrm{s}$.\n- Poisson’s ratio: $\\nu = 0.25$.\n- Angular frequencies: $\\omega_a = 0.1\\,\\mathrm{rad/s}$ and $\\omega_b = 10\\,\\mathrm{rad/s}$.\n- Fitting grid: $\\{\\tau_1, \\tau_2\\}$.\n\nNumerical and output requirements:\n- Compute $E'(\\omega)$ and $E''(\\omega)$ in $\\mathrm{MPa}$ for $\\omega_a$ and $\\omega_b$ in each test case, using your fitted parameters.\n- Round each reported modulus to $6$ decimal places.\n- The output for each test case must be a list of four floats in the order $[E'(\\omega_a), E''(\\omega_a), E'(\\omega_b), E''(\\omega_b)]$.\n- Your program should produce a single line of output containing a comma-separated list of these per-case lists, with no spaces anywhere, enclosed in square brackets. For example, the final output must look like $[[x_{11},x_{12},x_{13},x_{14}],[x_{21},x_{22},x_{23},x_{24}],[x_{31},x_{32},x_{33},x_{34}]]$ where each $x_{ij}$ is a float rounded to $6$ decimals.", "solution": "The problem is subjected to rigorous validation and is deemed valid. It is scientifically grounded in the principles of linear viscoelasticity, is mathematically well-posed, and all parameters and procedures are specified unambiguously.\n\nThe objective is to determine the coefficients of a generalized Maxwell model, represented by a Prony series, by fitting it to time-domain shear relaxation modulus data, $G(t)$. Subsequently, using these fitted parameters, we must compute the complex Young's modulus, $E^*(\\omega)$, at specified angular frequencies.\n\nThe shear relaxation modulus, $G(t)$, is given by the Prony series:\n$$G(t) = G_{\\infty} + \\sum_{k=1}^{N} g_k \\exp(-t/\\tau_k)$$\nwhere $G_{\\infty}$ is the long-term equilibrium shear modulus, $\\{g_k\\}_{k=1}^{N}$ are the moduli of the Maxwell branches, and $\\{\\tau_k\\}_{k=1}^{N}$ are the corresponding relaxation times. Physical consistency requires that $G_{\\infty} \\ge 0$ and $g_k \\ge 0$ for all $k$.\n\nThe process begins by generating a set of \"measured\" data points for $G(t)$ at a discrete series of time points $\\{t_j\\}_{j=1}^{M}$. For each test case, the problem specifies that this data is generated using a known set of ground-truth parameters. The time grid consists of $M=400$ points, uniformly spaced in the interval $[0, T_{\\max}]$, where $T_{\\max} = 1 + 5 \\max_k \\tau_k$.\n\nThe core of the task is to solve for the unknown coefficients, which we arrange into a vector $\\mathbf{x} = [g_1, g_2, \\dots, g_N, G_{\\infty}]^\\top$. For a fixed set of relaxation times $\\{\\tau_k\\}_{k=1}^{N}$, the model is linear with respect to these coefficients. The problem can be formulated as a linear system of equations, $\\mathbf{A}\\mathbf{x} = \\mathbf{b}$:\n$$\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n\\exp(-t_1/\\tau_1) & \\dots & \\exp(-t_1/\\tau_N) & 1 \\\\\n\\exp(-t_2/\\tau_1) & \\dots & \\exp(-t_2/\\tau_N) & 1 \\\\\n\\vdots & \\ddots & \\vdots & \\vdots \\\\\n\\exp(-t_M/\\tau_1) & \\dots & \\exp(-t_M/\\tau_N) & 1\n\\end{pmatrix}\n\\begin{pmatrix}\ng_1 \\\\\n\\vdots \\\\\ng_N \\\\\nG_{\\infty}\n\\end{pmatrix}\n=\n\\begin{pmatrix}\nG(t_1) \\\\\nG(t_2) \\\\\n\\vdots \\\\\nG(t_M)\n\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nHere, $\\mathbf{A}$ is the $M \\times (N+1)$ design matrix, and $\\mathbf{b}$ is the $M \\times 1$ vector of the \"measured\" $G(t_j)$ values. Due to the physical non-negativity constraints on the coefficients, we must solve this system using a nonnegative linear least squares (NNLS) algorithm. This algorithm finds the vector $\\mathbf{x}$ that minimizes the Euclidean norm of the residual, $\\|\\mathbf{A}\\mathbf{x} - \\mathbf{b}\\|_2$, subject to the constraint that all elements of $\\mathbf{x}$ are non-negative.\n\nOnce the fitted parameters, denoted $g_{k, \\text{fit}}$ and $G_{\\infty, \\text{fit}}$, have been determined, the complex shear modulus $G^*(\\omega)$ is calculated as:\n$$G^*(\\omega) = G_{\\infty, \\text{fit}} + \\sum_{k=1}^{N} g_{k, \\text{fit}} \\frac{i \\omega \\tau_k}{1 + i \\omega \\tau_k}$$\nwhere $i$ is the imaginary unit. To find the real and imaginary parts, we can rewrite the fractional term:\n$$\\frac{i \\omega \\tau_k}{1 + i \\omega \\tau_k} = \\frac{(\\omega \\tau_k)^2}{1 + (\\omega \\tau_k)^2} + i \\frac{\\omega \\tau_k}{1 + (\\omega \\tau_k)^2}$$\nThis allows for the separation of $G^*(\\omega)$ into its real part (storage modulus $G'(\\omega)$) and imaginary part (loss modulus $G''(\\omega)$):\n$$G'(\\omega) = G_{\\infty, \\text{fit}} + \\sum_{k=1}^{N} g_{k, \\text{fit}} \\frac{(\\omega \\tau_k)^2}{1 + (\\omega \\tau_k)^2}$$\n$$G''(\\omega) = \\sum_{k=1}^{N} g_{k, \\text{fit}} \\frac{\\omega \\tau_k}{1 + (\\omega \\tau_k)^2}$$\nThe complex Young's modulus, $E^*(\\omega)$, is related to the complex shear modulus through the Poisson's ratio, $\\nu$, assumed to be constant:\n$$E^*(\\omega) = 2(1+\\nu) G^*(\\omega)$$\nThe storage Young's modulus, $E'(\\omega)$, and loss Young's modulus, $E''(\\omega)$, are therefore:\n$$E'(\\omega) = \\Re[E^*(\\omega)] = 2(1+\\nu) G'(\\omega)$$\n$$E''(\\omega) = \\Im[E^*(\\omega)] = 2(1+\\nu) G''(\\omega)$$\nFor each test case, this procedure is executed. Since the \"measured\" data is generated from the ground-truth model and the fitting basis uses the correct relaxation times, the NNLS fit is expected to recover the ground-truth coefficients with high numerical accuracy.
