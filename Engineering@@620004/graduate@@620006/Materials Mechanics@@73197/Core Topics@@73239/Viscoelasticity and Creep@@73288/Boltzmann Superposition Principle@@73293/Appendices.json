For a set of discrete integrand values $y_k$ at frequencies $\\omega_k$ ($k=1, \\dots, N$), the integral is approximated as $\\sum_{k=1}^{N-1} \\frac{1}{2}(y_k + y_{k+1})(\\omega_{k+1} - \\omega_k)$. This is performed for each time point $t$ on a uniform grid from $t = -5.0$ s to $t = 5.0$ s with $501$ points. No apodization window is applied to the frequency data to strictly adhere to the direct inversion of the truncated data.\n\nThe physical plausibility of the numerically reconstructed $G(t)$ is then assessed using three metrics.\nFirst, causality is checked via the leakage ratio $r_{\\mathrm{neg}} = \\sup_{t<0} |G(t)| / \\sup_{t \\ge 0} |G(t)|$. A result is deemed causal if $r_{\\mathrm{neg}} \\le \\tau_c = 0.3$. An ideal causal function would have $r_{\\mathrm{neg}}=0$.\nSecond, non-negativity of the relaxation modulus for $t \\ge 0$ is checked. The result is considered non-negative if $\\min_{t \\ge 0} G(t) \\ge -\\tau_n \\sup_{t \\ge 0} |G(t)|$, with a small tolerance $\\tau_n = 0.05$.\nThird, the modulus must be a non-increasing function for $t \\ge 0$. This is quantified by comparing the total upward variation $V_+ = \\sum_{n} \\max(G(t_{n+1}) - G(t_{n}), 0)$ to the total downward variation $V_- = \\sum_{n} \\max(G(t_{n}) - G(t_{n+1}), 0)$ over the positive-time grid. The function is declared monotonically-decaying if $V_+ \\le \\tau_m V_-$ with $\\tau_m = 0.15$.\nA test case passes validation if and only if all three conditions (\"causal\", \"nonnegative\", and \"monotone\") are met.", "answer": "[True, True, False]", "id": "2869160"}]}
