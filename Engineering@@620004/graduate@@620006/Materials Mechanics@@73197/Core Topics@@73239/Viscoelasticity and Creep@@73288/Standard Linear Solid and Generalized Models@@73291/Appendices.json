The task is to determine the initial response of this model to a step strain, a classic problem in materials mechanics. All terms ($E_1$, $E_2$, $\\eta$, SLS model, Heaviside function, Dirac delta) are standard and well-defined. The constitutive laws are correct. The stated physical constraints, particularly the continuity of dashpot deformation to avoid infinite stress, are physically sound and essential for obtaining a unique, well-posed solution. The problem is scientifically grounded, self-contained, well-posed, and objective. It is a standard exercise in applying first principles of mechanics to a composite material model.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem statement is valid. I will proceed with the derivation of the solution.\n\n### Derivation\nThe model consists of two branches in parallel. The total strain $\\epsilon(t)$ is applied to both branches.\nBranch 1: Maxwell element (spring $E_{1}$ in series with dashpot $\\eta$).\nBranch 2: Spring with modulus $E_{2}$.\n\nThe applied strain is a step function: $\\epsilon(t) = \\epsilon_{0}H(t)$.\nAt any time $t>0$, the strain is constant: $\\epsilon(t) = \\epsilon_{0}$. Thus, for $t=0^{+}$, we have $\\epsilon(0^{+}) = \\epsilon_{0}$.\n\nLet us analyze the state of the system at the instant $t=0^{+}$.\n\n**Analysis of the Parallel Spring ($E_{2}$)**\nThe strain in this spring is equal to the total strain, $\\epsilon_{E_{2}}(t) = \\epsilon(t)$.\nAt $t=0^{+}$, the strain is $\\epsilon_{E_{2}}(0^{+}) = \\epsilon(0^{+}) = \\epsilon_{0}$.\nThe stress in this spring is given by the constitutive relation $\\sigma_{E_{2}}(t) = E_{2}\\,\\epsilon_{E_{2}}(t)$.\nTherefore, at $t=0^{+}$, the stress is $\\sigma_{E_{2}}(0^{+}) = E_{2}\\epsilon_{0}$.\n\n**Analysis of the Maxwell Branch**\nThe strain in the Maxwell branch is also equal to the total strain, $\\epsilon_{M}(t) = \\epsilon(t)$. At $t=0^{+}$, $\\epsilon_{M}(0^{+}) = \\epsilon_{0}$.\nThis branch consists of a spring ($E_{1}$) and a dashpot ($\\eta$) in series. The strains are additive:\n$$ \\epsilon_{M}(t) = \\epsilon_{s}(t) + \\epsilon_{d}(t) $$\nAt $t=0^{+}$, this means $\\epsilon_{0} = \\epsilon_{s}(0^{+}) + \\epsilon_{d}(0^{+})$.\n\nThe crucial element is the dashpot. Its constitutive law is $\\sigma_{d}(t) = \\eta \\dot{\\epsilon}_{d}(t)$, where $\\dot{\\epsilon}_{d}(t) = \\frac{d\\epsilon_{d}}{dt}$.\nThe problem specifies that there can be no impulsive (Dirac delta) stress. An instantaneous jump in the dashpot strain $\\epsilon_{d}(t)$ from $\\epsilon_{d}(0^{-})=0$ to a non-zero value $\\epsilon_{d}(0^{+})$ would imply that the strain rate $\\dot{\\epsilon}_{d}(t)$ contains a Dirac delta term, specifically $\\dot{\\epsilon}_{d}(t) = \\epsilon_{d}(0^{+})\\delta(t) + \\dots$. This would produce an impulsive stress $\\sigma_{d}(t) = \\eta \\epsilon_{d}(0^{+})\\delta(t) + \\dots$, which is forbidden by the problem's physical admissibility conditions.\n\nTherefore, the strain in the dashpot must be a continuous function of time at $t=0$.\nGiven that the bar is unstrained for $t<0$, we have $\\epsilon_{d}(0^{-}) = 0$.\nBy continuity, the strain in the dashpot at $t=0^{+}$ must be:\n$$ \\epsilon_{d}(0^{+}) = 0 $$\nThis is a key result. A dashpot behaves as a rigid link under an instantaneous application of strain.\n\nNow we can determine the strain in the Maxwell spring. From the additive strain relation:\n$$ \\epsilon_{s}(0^{+}) = \\epsilon_{0} - \\epsilon_{d}(0^{+}) = \\epsilon_{0} - 0 = \\epsilon_{0} $$\nSo, at $t=0^{+}$, the entire strain in the Maxwell branch is taken up by the spring.\n\nThe stress in the Maxwell branch, $\\sigma_{M}(t)$, is the same for both the spring and the dashpot in series: $\\sigma_{M}(t) = \\sigma_{s}(t) = \\sigma_{d}(t)$.\nAt $t=0^{+}$, we can calculate this stress from the spring $E_{1}$:\n$$ \\sigma_{M}(0^{+}) = \\sigma_{s}(0^{+}) = E_{1}\\epsilon_{s}(0^{+}) = E_{1}\\epsilon_{0} $$\nThis stress is finite, which is consistent with the initial assumptions.\n\nNow, let us find the total stress on the bar at $t=0^{+}$. The total stress is the sum of stresses in the parallel branches:\n$$ \\sigma(t) = \\sigma_{M}(t) + \\sigma_{E_{2}}(t) $$\nAt $t=0^{+}$, we have:\n$$ \\sigma(0^{+}) = \\sigma_{M}(0^{+}) + \\sigma_{E_{2}}(0^{+}) = E_{1}\\epsilon_{0} + E_{2}\\epsilon_{0} = (E_{1}+E_{2})\\epsilon_{0} $$\nThe instantaneous modulus of the SLS model is therefore $E_{\\text{inst}} = E_{1}+E_{2}$.\n\nFinally, let us check for consistency with the dashpot constitutive law at $t=0^{+}$. We have $\\sigma_{d}(0^{+}) = \\sigma_{M}(0^{+}) = E_{1}\\epsilon_{0}$.\nFrom $\\sigma_{d}(t) = \\eta \\dot{\\epsilon}_{d}(t)$, we can determine the initial rate of strain in the dashpot:\n$$ \\dot{\\epsilon}_{d}(0^{+}) = \\frac{\\sigma_{d}(0^{+})}{\\eta} = \\frac{E_{1}\\epsilon_{0}}{\\eta} $$\nThis is a finite, well-defined value. It represents the rate at which the dashpot starts to deform immediately after the load is applied, allowing the stress in the Maxwell arm to relax over time. All conditions are internally consistent.\n\nSummary of initial conditions at $t=0^{+}$:\n- $\\epsilon_{d}(0^{+}) = 0$\n- $\\epsilon_{s}(0^{+}) = \\epsilon_{0}$\n- $\\sigma_{M}(0^{+}) = E_{1}\\epsilon_{0}$\n- $\\sigma(0^{+}) = (E_{1}+E_{2})\\epsilon_{0}$\n- $\\dot{\\epsilon}_{d}(0^{+}) = E_{1}\\epsilon_{0}/\\eta$\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. $\\epsilon_{s}(0^{+})=\\epsilon_{0}$, $\\epsilon_{d}(0^{+})=0$, $\\sigma_{M}(0^{+})=E_{1}\\,\\epsilon_{0}$, $\\sigma(0^{+})=(E_{1}+E_{2})\\,\\epsilon_{0}$, and $\\dot{\\epsilon}_{d}(0^{+})=\\sigma_{M}(0^{+})/\\eta=E_{1}\\epsilon_{0}/\\eta$; there is no Dirac delta in $\\sigma_{M}$.**\nThis option presents a set of values for the initial conditions.\n- $\\epsilon_{s}(0^{+})=\\epsilon_{0}$: Correct, as derived.\n- $\\epsilon_{d}(0^{+})=0$: Correct, as derived from the no-impulsive-stress condition.\n- $\\sigma_{M}(0^{+})=E_{1}\\,\\epsilon_{0}$: Correct, from $\\sigma_{M}(0^{+}) = E_{1}\\epsilon_{s}(0^{+})$.\n- $\\sigma(0^{+})=(E_{1}+E_{2})\\,\\epsilon_{0}$: Correct, from the sum of parallel branch stresses.\n- $\\dot{\\epsilon}_{d}(0^{+})=E_{1}\\epsilon_{0}/\\eta$: Correct, from the dashpot constitutive law.\n- no Dirac delta in $\\sigma_{M}$: Correct, as $\\sigma_{M}(0^{+})$ is finite.\nEvery statement in this option aligns perfectly with our rigorous derivation.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. $\\epsilon_{s}(0^{+})=0$, $\\epsilon_{d}(0^{+})=\\epsilon_{0}$, and the Maxwell branch responds with an impulsive stress $\\sigma_{M}(t)=C\\,\\delta(t)$ for some finite constant $C$ so that $\\sigma(0^{+})=E_{2}\\,\\epsilon_{0}$ remains finite.**\n- $\\epsilon_{s}(0^{+})=0$ and $\\epsilon_{d}(0^{+})=\\epsilon_{0}$: Incorrect.

It is the spring that deforms instantaneously.\n- $\\sigma_{M}(t)=C\\,\\delta(t)$: This is a direct consequence of the incorrect assumption $\\epsilon_{d}(0^{+})=\\epsilon_{0}$, but it explicitly violates the problem's stated condition of \"No impulsive (Dirac delta) stress\".\n- $\\sigma(0^{+})=E_{2}\\,\\epsilon_{0}$ remains finite: This is contradictory. If $\\sigma_M(t)$ is impulsive, the total stress $\\sigma(t) = \\sigma_M(t) + \\sigma_{E_2}(t)$ must also be impulsive. The option is internally inconsistent and contradicts the problem constraints.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C.

This is the formula for springs in series. At $t=0^{+}$, the dashpot is rigid, so the system behaves as two springs ($E_1$ and $E_2$) in parallel. The correct instantaneous modulus is $E_{\\mathrm{inst}} = E_1+E_2$.\n- The strain partitioning $\\epsilon_{s}(0^{+})=\\dfrac{E_{2}}{E_{1}+E_{2}}\\,\\epsilon_{0}$ and $\\epsilon_{d}(0^{+})=\\dfrac{E_{1}}{E_{1}+E_{2}}\\,\\epsilon_{0}$: Incorrect. This partitioning is arbitrary and violates the fact that $\\epsilon_d(0^+) = 0$. This kind of partitioning occurs for stress in parallel elements, not for strain in series elements under these dynamic conditions.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. The dashpot blocks any instantaneous deformation in its series branch, so the Maxwell branch has zero instantaneous strain: $\\epsilon_{s}(0^{+})=0$, $\\epsilon_{d}(0^{+})=0$, hence $\\sigma_{M}(0^{+})=0$ and $\\sigma(0^{+})=E_{2}\\,\\epsilon_{0}$.**\n- \"The dashpot blocks any instantaneous deformation\": This is correct for the dashpot itself, meaning $\\epsilon_d(0^+)=0$.\n- \"so the Maxwell branch has zero instantaneous strain\": This is an incorrect inference. The Maxwell branch is in parallel with the spring $E_2$ and is subjected to the full applied strain $\\epsilon(0^+) = \\epsilon_0$.\n- $\\epsilon_{s}(0^{+})=0$, $\\epsilon_{d}(0^{+})=0$: This would imply the total strain in the Maxwell branch is $\\epsilon_M(0^+) = \\epsilon_s(0^+) + \\epsilon_d(0^+) = 0$, contradicting that $\\epsilon_M(0^+) = \\epsilon_0$.\n- $\\sigma(0^{+})=E_{2}\\,\\epsilon_{0}$: This is the long-term, relaxed stress, which occurs at $t \\to \\infty$ when the dashpot is fully relaxed and carries no stress.

The presence of a negative modulus coefficient, $G_{2} < 0$, may lead to unphysical behavior (violation of the second law of thermodynamics), and the problem is structured precisely to investigate this by asking for the frequency at which energy dissipation becomes negative. This is a valid and instructive exercise in understanding the physical constraints on mathematical models of materials. The problem provides all necessary information and is free from contradiction or ambiguity. Thus, the problem is deemed valid.\n\nSolution:\nWe begin by deriving the complex modulus $G^{\\ast}(\\omega)$ from the superposition integral. For a harmonic strain, it is most convenient to use the complex representation $\\gamma(t) = \\gamma_{0} \\exp(i\\omega t)$. The strain rate is then $\\frac{d\\gamma}{dt} = i\\omega \\gamma_{0} \\exp(i\\omega t)$. Substituting this into the superposition integral:\n$$\n\\sigma(t) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{t} G(t-t') [i\\omega\\gamma_{0} \\exp(i\\omega t')] dt'\n$$\nWe make a change of variable $s = t - t'$, so $t' = t - s$ and $dt' = -ds$. The limits of integration become $s=0$ for $t'=t$ and $s=\\infty$ for $t' \\to -\\infty$.\n$$\n\\sigma(t) = \\int_{\\infty}^{0} G(s) [i\\omega\\gamma_{0} \\exp(i\\omega(t-s))] (-ds) = \\gamma_{0} \\exp(i\\omega t) \\left[ i\\omega \\int_{0}^{\\infty} G(s) \\exp(-i\\omega s) ds \\right]\n$$\nThe stress response is also harmonic, $\\sigma(t) = \\sigma_{0} \\exp(i\\omega t)$, where $\\sigma_0$ is a complex amplitude. The complex modulus $G^{\\ast}(\\omega)$ is defined by $\\sigma(t) = G^{\\ast}(\\omega) \\gamma(t)$. Comparing with the expression above, we find\n$$\nG^{\\ast}(\\omega) = i\\omega \\int_{0}^{\\infty} G(t) \\exp(-i\\omega t) dt\n$$\nThis relation is valid for materials where $G(t) \\to 0$ as $t \\to \\infty$, which is true for the given model since $G_{\\infty} = 0$.\n\nNow we substitute the given expression for $G(t)$ into this formula:\n$$\nG^{\\ast}(\\omega) = i\\omega \\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\left[ G_{1}\\exp(-t/\\tau_{1}) + G_{2}\\exp(-t/\\tau_{2}) \\right] \\exp(-i\\omega t) dt\n$$\nThe integral is linear, so we can consider each term separately. For a general term $G_{k}\\exp(-t/\\tau_{k})$, its contribution to the integral is:\n$$\n\\int_{0}^{\\infty} G_{k}\\exp(-t/\\tau_{k}) \\exp(-i\\omega t) dt = G_{k} \\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\exp\\left(-\\left(\\frac{1}{\\tau_{k}} + i\\omega\\right)t\\right) dt\n$$\nThis is a standard exponential integral, which evaluates to:\n$$\nG_{k} \\left[ \\frac{\\exp\\left(-\\left(\\frac{1}{\\tau_{k}} + i\\omega\\right)t\\right)}{-\\left(\\frac{1}{\\tau_{k}} + i\\omega\\right)} \\right]_{0}^{\\infty} = G_{k} \\left( 0 - \\frac{1}{-\\left(\\frac{1}{\\tau_{k}} + i\\omega\\right)} \\right) = \\frac{G_{k}}{\\frac{1}{\\tau_{k}} + i\\omega} = \\frac{G_{k}\\tau_{k}}{1 + i\\omega\\tau_{k}}\n$$\nSubstituting this back into the expression for $G^{\\ast}(\\omega)$:\n$$\nG^{\\ast}(\\omega) = i\\omega \\left( \\frac{G_{1}\\tau_{1}}{1 + i\\omega\\tau_{1}} + \\frac{G_{2}\\tau_{2}}{1 + i\\omega\\tau_{2}} \\right) = G_{1} \\frac{i\\omega\\tau_{1}}{1 + i\\omega\\tau_{1}} + G_{2} \\frac{i\\omega\\tau_{2}}{1 + i\\omega\\tau_{2}}\n$$\nTo find the loss modulus $G''(\\omega)$, which is the imaginary part of $G^{\\ast}(\\omega) = G'(\\omega) + iG''(\\omega)$, we rationalize each term:\n$$\n\\frac{i\\omega\\tau_{k}}{1 + i\\omega\\tau_{k}} = \\frac{i\\omega\\tau_{k}(1 - i\\omega\\tau_{k})}{(1 + i\\omega\\tau_{k})(1 - i\\omega\\tau_{k})} = \\frac{i\\omega\\tau_{k} - (i\\omega\\tau_{k})^2}{1 - (i\\omega\\tau_{k})^2} = \\frac{(\\omega\\tau_{k})^2 + i\\omega\\tau_{k}}{1 + (\\omega\\tau_{k})^2}\n$$\nThe imaginary part of this expression is $\\frac{\\omega\\tau_{k}}{1 + (\\omega\\tau_{k})^2}$.\nThus, the loss modulus for the generalized Maxwell model is the sum of contributions from each mode:\n$$\nG''(\\omega) = G_{1} \\frac{\\omega\\tau_{1}}{1 + (\\omega\\tau_{1})^2} + G_{2} \\frac{\\omega\\tau_{2}}{1 + (\\omega\\tau_{2})^2}\n$$\nThis is the explicit expression for the loss modulus.\n\nNext, we argue from first principles that a passive material must have $G''(\\omega) \\ge 0$. The instantaneous power dissipated per unit volume is $\\dot{w}(t) = \\sigma(t) \\dot{\\gamma}(t)$. For a sinusoidal strain $\\gamma(t) = \\gamma_{0}\\sin(\\omega t)$, the strain rate is $\\dot{\\gamma}(t) = \\omega\\gamma_{0}\\cos(\\omega t)$. The corresponding stress is $\\sigma(t) = \\gamma_{0} (G'(\\omega)\\sin(\\omega t) + G''(\\omega)\\cos(\\omega t))$.\nThe energy dissipated per unit volume over one cycle of deformation (from $t=0$ to $t=T=2\\pi/\\omega$) is $\\Delta W_{d}$:\n$$\n\\Delta W_{d} = \\int_{0}^{T} \\sigma(t)\\dot{\\gamma}(t) dt = \\int_{0}^{2\\pi/\\omega} \\gamma_{0}[G'(\\omega)\\sin(\\omega t) + G''(\\omega)\\cos(\\omega t)] \\cdot [\\omega\\gamma_{0}\\cos(\\omega t)] dt\n$$\n$$\n\\Delta W_{d} = \\omega\\gamma_{0}^{2} \\int_{0}^{2\\pi/\\omega} [G'(\\omega)\\sin(\\omega t)\\cos(\\omega t) + G''(\\omega)\\cos^{2}(\\omega t)] dt\n$$\nThe integral of the term with $G'(\\omega)$ is $\\int_{0}^{2\\pi/\\omega} \\frac{1}{2}\\sin(2\\omega t) dt = [-\\frac{1}{4\\omega}\\cos(2\\omega t)]_0^{2\\pi/\\omega} = 0$. This term represents recoverable stored elastic energy.\nThe integral of the term with $G''(\\omega)$ is $\\int_{0}^{2\\pi/\\omega} \\cos^{2}(\\omega t) dt = \\int_{0}^{2\\pi/\\omega} \\frac{1+\\cos(2\\omega t)}{2} dt = [\\frac{t}{2} + \\frac{\\sin(2\\omega t)}{4\\omega}]_0^{2\\pi/\\omega} = \\frac{\\pi}{\\omega}$.\nSubstituting this result back, we find the dissipated energy per cycle:\n$$\n\\Delta W_{d} = \\omega\\gamma_{0}^{2} \\left[ G'(\\omega) \\cdot 0 + G''(\\omega) \\cdot \\frac{\\pi}{\\omega} \\right] = \\pi \\gamma_{0}^{2} G''(\\omega)\n$$\nThe second law of thermodynamics requires that for any passive material, the net energy dissipated over a closed cycle must be non-negative, i.e., $\\Delta W_{d} \\ge 0$. Since $\\pi > 0$ and $\\gamma_{0}^{2} \\ge 0$, this implies the physical constraint $G''(\\omega) \\ge 0$ for all frequencies $\\omega \\ge 0$.

It is scientifically grounded, free of ambiguity, and contains all necessary information for a unique solution. We shall proceed with the derivation and solution.\n\nThe foundation of our analysis is the theory of linear viscoelasticity for an isotropic solid under small strains. The material is modeled as a generalized Maxwell model, which consists of an equilibrium spring placed in parallel with a set of Maxwell elements. In this specific problem, there are two such Maxwell elements.\n\nLet us begin by deriving the necessary theoretical expressions for the relaxation modulus and the complex modulus.\n\nA generalized Maxwell model with an equilibrium spring and $N$ Maxwell branches in parallel has a total stress $\\sigma(t)$ that is the sum of the stresses in each parallel component when subjected to a uniform strain $\\epsilon(t)$.\n$$\n\\sigma(t) = \\sigma_{\\infty}(t) + \\sum_{k=1}^{N} \\sigma_{k}(t)\n$$\nHere, $\\sigma_{\\infty}(t)$ is the stress in the equilibrium spring, defined by Hooke's law:\n$$\n\\sigma_{\\infty}(t) = G_{\\infty} \\epsilon(t)\n$$\nwhere $G_{\\infty}$ is the equilibrium modulus. Each Maxwell branch $k$ consists of a spring (modulus $G_k$) and a dashpot (viscosity $\\eta_k$) in series. The constitutive equation for the stress $\\sigma_k(t)$ in the $k$-th branch is given by the first-order ordinary differential equation:\n$$\n\\dot{\\sigma}_k(t) + \\frac{1}{\\tau_k} \\sigma_k(t) = G_k \\dot{\\epsilon}(t)\n$$\nwhere $\\tau_k = \\eta_k / G_k$ is the relaxation time of the branch.\n\nFirst, we derive the uniaxial relaxation modulus, $G(t)$. This is defined as the stress response to a unit step strain, $\\epsilon(t) = \\epsilon_0 H(t)$, where $H(t)$ is the Heaviside step function. Consequently, the strain rate is $\\dot{\\epsilon}(t) = \\epsilon_0 \\delta(t)$, where $\\delta(t)$ is the Dirac delta function. The modulus is $G(t) = \\sigma(t) / \\epsilon_0$.\n\nFor the equilibrium spring, the stress response is $\\sigma_{\\infty}(t) = G_{\\infty} \\epsilon_0 H(t)$. For the $k$-th Maxwell branch, we must solve:\n$$\n\\dot{\\sigma}_k(t) + \\frac{1}{\\tau_k} \\sigma_k(t) = G_k \\epsilon_0 \\delta(t)\n$$\nAssuming the system is at rest for $t < 0$, integrating this equation from $t=0^-$ to $t=0^+$ yields the initial condition $\\sigma_k(0^+) = G_k \\epsilon_0$. For $t > 0$, the equation becomes homogeneous, $\\dot{\\sigma}_k(t) + (1/\\tau_k) \\sigma_k(t) = 0$, with the solution $\\sigma_k(t) = G_k \\epsilon_0 e^{-t/\\tau_k}$.\n\nSumming the stress contributions from the equilibrium spring and the two specified Maxwell branches ($N=2$), the total stress for $t \\ge 0$ is:\n$$\n\\sigma(t) = G_{\\infty} \\epsilon_0 + G_1 \\epsilon_0 e^{-t/\\tau_1} + G_2 \\epsilon_0 e^{-t/\\tau_2}\n$$\nDividing by $\\epsilon_0$, we obtain the relaxation modulus $G(t)$:\n$$\nG(t) = G_{\\infty} + G_1 e^{-t/\\tau_1} + G_2 e^{-t/\\tau_2}\n$$\n\nNext, we derive the complex modulus, $G^*(\\omega) = G'(\\omega) + i G''(\\omega)$. This is obtained by considering the steady-state response to a sinusoidal strain, $\\epsilon(t) = \\hat{\\epsilon} e^{i\\omega t}$. The stress will also be sinusoidal, $\\sigma(t) = \\hat{\\sigma} e^{i\\omega t}$, and the complex modulus is the ratio of their phasors, $G^*(\\omega) = \\hat{\\sigma} / \\hat{\\epsilon}$.\n\nFor the equilibrium spring, the complex modulus is simply $G^*_{\\infty}(\\omega) = G_{\\infty}$. For the $k$-th Maxwell branch, we substitute the sinusoidal forms of stress and strain into its constitutive equation:\n$$\ni\\omega \\hat{\\sigma}_k e^{i\\omega t} + \\frac{1}{\\tau_k} \\hat{\\sigma}_k e^{i\\omega t} = G_k (i\\omega \\hat{\\epsilon} e^{i\\omega t})\n$$\nSolving for the branch's complex modulus $G_k^*(\\omega) = \\hat{\\sigma}_k / \\hat{\\epsilon}$ gives:\n$$\nG_k^*(\\omega) = G_k \\frac{i\\omega\\tau_k}{1+i\\omega\\tau_k} = G_k \\frac{i\\omega\\tau_k(1-i\\omega\\tau_k)}{1+(\\omega\\tau_k)^2} = G_k \\frac{(\\omega\\tau_k)^2 + i\\omega\\tau_k}{1+(\\omega\\tau_k)^2}\n$$\nThe total complex modulus is the sum of the parallel components:\n$$\nG^*(\\omega) = G^*_{\\infty}(\\omega) + G^*_{1}(\\omega) + G^*_{2}(\\omega) = G_{\\infty} + G_1 \\frac{i\\omega\\tau_1}{1+i\\omega\\tau_1} + G_2 \\frac{i\\omega\\tau_2}{1+i\\omega\\tau_2}\n$$\nSeparating this into its real and imaginary parts yields the storage modulus, $G'(\\omega)$, and the loss modulus, $G''(\\omega)$:\n$$\nG'(\\omega) = \\text{Re}[G^*(\\omega)] = G_{\\infty} + G_1 \\frac{(\\omega\\tau_1)^2}{1+(\\omega\\tau_1)^2} + G_2 \\frac{(\\omega\\tau_2)^2}{1+(\\omega\\tau_2)^2}\n$$\n$$\nG''(\\omega) = \\text{Im}[G^*(\\omega)] = G_1 \\frac{\\omega\\tau_1}{1+(\\omega\\tau_1)^2} + G_2 \\frac{\\omega\\tau_2}{1+(\\omega\\tau_2)^2}\n$$\nThe derived expressions for $G(t)$, $G'(\\omega)$, and $G''(\\omega)$ are all linear with respect to the unknown model parameters $\\boldsymbol{\\theta} = [G_{\\infty}, G_1, G_2]^\\top$. This allows us to formulate the inversion as a linear least-squares problem.\n\nThe objective is to minimize the weighted sum of squared residuals:\n$$\nJ(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}) = \\alpha_t \\lVert A_t \\boldsymbol{\\theta} - \\mathbf{y}_t \\rVert_2^2 + \\alpha_f \\lVert A_f \\boldsymbol{\\theta} - \\mathbf{y}_f \\rVert_2^2\n$$\nLet there be $M_t$ time-domain measurements at times $t_i$ and $M_f$ frequency-domain measurements at angular frequencies $\\omega_j$. For our problem, $M_t=7$ and $M_f=4$.\n\nThe time-domain system is $A_t \\boldsymbol{\\theta} = \\mathbf{y}_t$, where $\\mathbf{y}_t$ is the $M_t \\times 1$ vector of measured $G(t_i)$ values. The design matrix $A_t$ is an $M_t \\times 3$ matrix whose $i$-th row is:\n$$\n[A_t]_{i,:} = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & e^{-t_i/\\tau_1} & e^{-t_i/\\tau_2} \\end{bmatrix}\n$$\nThe frequency-domain system is $A_f \\boldsymbol{\\theta} = \\mathbf{y}_f$. It combines both storage and loss modulus data. We construct a $(2M_f) \\times 3$ matrix $A_f$ and a $(2M_f) \\times 1$ vector $\\mathbf{y}_f$. We stack the $G'$ data first, then the $G''$ data.\nFor $j=1, \\dots, M_f$, the $j$-th row of $A_f$ (corresponding to $G'(\\omega_j)$) is:\n$$\n[A_f]_{j,:} = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & \\frac{(\\omega_j\\tau_1)^2}{1+(\\omega_j\\tau_1)^2} & \\frac{(\\omega_j\\tau_2)^2}{1+(\\omega_j\\tau_2)^2} \\end{bmatrix}\n$$\nThe $(j+M_f)$-th row of $A_f$ (corresponding to $G''(\\omega_j)$) is:\n$$\n[A_f]_{j+M_f,:} = \\begin{bmatrix} 0 & \\frac{\\omega_j\\tau_1}{1+(\\omega_j\\tau_1)^2} & \\frac{\\omega_j\\tau_2}{1+(\\omega_j\\tau_2)^2} \\end{bmatrix}\n$$\nThe data vector $\\mathbf{y}_f$ is formed by concatenating the measured $G'(\\omega_j)$ and $G''(\\omega_j)$ values.\n\nThe total objective function $J(\\boldsymbol{\\theta})$ can be minimized by solving a single augmented linear least-squares problem:\n$$\n\\min_{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}} \\left\\lVert \\begin{bmatrix} \\sqrt{\\alpha_t} A_t \\\\ \\sqrt{\\alpha_f} A_f \\end{bmatrix} \\boldsymbol{\\theta} - \\begin{bmatrix} \\sqrt{\\alpha_t} \\mathbf{y}_t \\\\ \\sqrt{\\alpha_f} \\mathbf{y}_f \\end{bmatrix} \\right\\rVert_2^2\n$$\nLet $A_{stack} = \\begin{bmatrix} \\sqrt{\\alpha_t} A_t \\\\ \\sqrt{\\alpha_f} A_f \\end{bmatrix}$ and $\\mathbf{y}_{stack} = \\begin{bmatrix} \\sqrt{\\alpha_t} \\mathbf{y}_t \\\\ \\sqrt{\\alpha_f} \\mathbf{y}_f \\end{bmatrix}$. The problem reduces to finding the least-squares solution $\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}}$ to the system $A_{stack} \\boldsymbol{\\theta} \\approx \\mathbf{y}_{stack}$. This is a standard procedure in linear algebra, robustly solvable using methods such as QR decomposition.\n\nThe implementation will construct these matrices using the provided data and known relaxation times $\\tau_1=0.1\\,\\mathrm{s}$ and $\\tau_2=10\\,\\mathrm{s}$. For each specified pair of weights $(\\alpha_t, \\alpha_f)$, the corresponding stacked system will be assembled and solved for $\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}}$.
