The outward unit normal vector $\\vec{n}$ is the radial unit vector $\\hat{e}_r$, whose Cartesian components are $n_x = \\cos\\theta$ and $n_y = \\sin\\theta$. We need to express each term in the integrand in polar coordinates.\n\nFirst, we express the strain energy density $W$ in terms of the given stress fields. The definition is:\n$$\nW = \\frac{1}{2}\\, \\mu \\left[ \\left(\\frac{\\partial u_{z}}{\\partial x}\\right)^{2} + \\left(\\frac{\\partial u_{z}}{\\partial y}\\right)^{2} \\right] = \\frac{1}{2}\\, \\mu |\\nabla u_z|^2\n$$\nIn polar coordinates, the gradient squared is $|\\nabla u_z|^2 = (\\frac{\\partial u_z}{\\partial r})^2 + \\frac{1}{r^2}(\\frac{\\partial u_z}{\\partial \\theta})^2$.

All necessary physical and mathematical context for the derivation is provided.\n- **Conclusion**: The problem statement is valid. No flaws are detected.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. We proceed with the derivation and solution.\n\nThe standard Rice $J$-integral for a contour $\\Gamma$ is given by\n$$ J = \\int_{\\Gamma} (W n_1 - t_i u_{i,1}) \\, ds = \\int_{\\Gamma} (W n_1 - \\sigma_{ij}n_j u_{i,1}) \\, ds $$\nThis expression can be recognized as the flux of the $x_1$-component of the energy-momentum (or Eshelby) tensor $\\Sigma_{jk} = W\\delta_{jk} - \\sigma_{ik}u_{i,j}$ across the contour $\\Gamma$. That is, $J=\\int_\\Gamma \\Sigma_{1j}n_j ds$.\n\nFor a homogeneous, elastic material in the absence of body forces, the energy-momentum tensor is divergence-free, i.e., $\\Sigma_{jk,k} = 0$. We apply the divergence theorem to the annular region $A$ bounded externally by $\\Gamma_2$ and internally by $\\Gamma_1$ and the crack-face segment $\\Gamma_c$. The total boundary of $A$ is $\\partial A = \\Gamma_2 \\cup (-\\Gamma_1) \\cup \\Gamma_c$, where $-\\Gamma_1$ indicates traversal in the clockwise direction and $\\Gamma_c = \\Gamma_c^+ \\cup \\Gamma_c^-$ comprises the upper and lower crack-face segments.\n\nApplying the divergence theorem for the $j=1$ component of the Eshelby tensor:\n$$ \\int_A \\Sigma_{1k,k} \\, dA = \\oint_{\\partial A} \\Sigma_{1k} n_k \\, ds = 0 $$\nExpanding the boundary integral:\n$$ \\int_{\\Gamma_2} \\Sigma_{1k} n_k \\, ds + \\int_{-\\Gamma_1} \\Sigma_{1k} n_k \\, ds + \\int_{\\Gamma_c} \\Sigma_{1k} n_k \\, ds = 0 $$\nRecognizing the definition of the $J$-integral, this becomes:\n$$ J(\\Gamma_2) - J(\\Gamma_1) + \\int_{\\Gamma_c^+ \\cup \\Gamma_c^-} (Wn_1 - \\sigma_{ij}n_j u_{i,1}) \\, ds = 0 $$\nLet's evaluate the integral over the crack faces. The crack lies on the $x_1$-axis, so for any point on $\\Gamma_c^+$ or $\\Gamma_c^-$, the normal vector $n_j$ to the boundary of the annular domain $A$ is orthogonal to the $x_1$-direction. Specifically, on the upper face $\\Gamma_c^+$, the outward normal to $A$ is $n_j=(0, -1)$, so $n_1=0$. On the lower face $\\Gamma_c^-$, the outward normal to $A$ is $n_j=(0, 1)$, so $n_1=0$. This simplifies the crack-face integral to:\n$$ \\int_{\\Gamma_c^+ \\cup \\Gamma_c^-} (-\\sigma_{ij}n_j u_{i,1}) \\, ds = \\int_{\\Gamma_c^+} (-\\sigma_{i2}(-1) u_{i,1}^+) \\, ds + \\int_{\\Gamma_c^-} (-\\sigma_{i2}(1) u_{i,1}^-) \\, ds $$\n$$ = \\int_{\\Gamma_c} (\\sigma_{i2}(x_1, 0^+) u_{i,1}(x_1, 0^+) - \\sigma_{i2}(x_1, 0^-) u_{i,1}(x_1, 0^-)) \\, dx_1 $$\nwhere the integral is over the segment of the $x_1$-axis between $\\Gamma_1$ and $\\Gamma_2$.\nTraction continuity across the contact interface requires $\\sigma_{i2}(x_1, 0^+) = \\sigma_{i2}(x_1, 0^-)$. Let's denote this common traction stress component by $\\sigma_{i2}(x_1)$. The expression becomes:\n$$ \\int_{\\Gamma_c} \\sigma_{i2}(x_1) (u_{i,1}(x_1, 0^+) - u_{i,1}(x_1, 0^-)) \\, dx_1 $$\nLet $\\Delta u_i(x_1) = u_i(x_1, 0^+) - u_i(x_1, 0^-)$ be the displacement jump across the crack. Since differentiation with respect to $x_1$ and the jump operation commute, we have $(u_{i,1}^+ - u_{i,1}^-) = (\\Delta u_i)_{,1}$. The integral is:\n$$ \\int_{\\Gamma_c} \\sigma_{i2} (\\Delta u_i)_{,1} \\, dx_1 = \\int_{\\Gamma_c} \\left( \\sigma_{12} (\\Delta u_1)_{,1} + \\sigma_{22} (\\Delta u_2)_{,1} \\right) \\, dx_1 $$\nDue to the impenetrability condition in the contact zone, the normal displacement jump is zero: $\\Delta u_2 = 0$, which implies $(\\Delta u_2)_{,1} = 0$. The path dependence is thus solely due to friction:\n$$ \\int_{\\Gamma_c} \\sigma_{12} (\\Delta u_1)_{,1} \\, dx_1 $$\nThe balance equation is now:\n$$ J(\\Gamma_2) - J(\\Gamma_1) + \\int_{\\Gamma_c} \\sigma_{12} (\\Delta u_1)_{,1} \\, dx_1 = 0 \\implies J(\\Gamma_2) - J(\\Gamma_1) = - \\int_{\\Gamma_c} \\sigma_{12} (\\Delta u_1)_{,1} \\, dx_1 $$\nSince $\\sigma_{12}$ (frictional shear) and $\\Delta u_1$ (slip) are generally nonzero, $J(\\Gamma_1) \\ne J(\\Gamma_2)$. The standard $J$-integral is not path-independent in the presence of friction.\n\nTo construct a path-independent integral, we must add a correction term that counteracts this path dependence. Let the modified integral be $J^*(\\Gamma) = J(\\Gamma) + K(\\Gamma)$, where $K(\\Gamma)$ is an integral along the contacting crack faces from the tip ($x_1=-\\ell$) to the intersection with contour $\\Gamma$.\nPath independence requires $J^*(\\Gamma_2) - J^*(\\Gamma_1) = 0$, which implies:\n$$ (J(\\Gamma_2) - J(\\Gamma_1)) + (K(\\Gamma_2) - K(\\Gamma_1)) = 0 $$\n$$ - \\int_{\\Gamma_c} \\sigma_{12} (\\Delta u_1)_{,1} \\, dx_1 + \\int_{\\Gamma_c} dK = 0 $$\nThis is satisfied if $dK = \\sigma_{12} (\\Delta u_1)_{,1} \\, dx_1$. Therefore, the path-independent integral is:\n$$ J^*(\\Gamma) = J(\\Gamma) + \\int_{-\\ell}^{\\Gamma} \\sigma_{12} (\\Delta u_1)_{,1} \\, ds $$\nThis integral $J^*$ is equal to the energy release rate $G$ at the crack tip.\n\nNow, we evaluate the options. The options propose a correction term of the form $\\int_{\\Gamma_c} t_i u_{i,1} ds$. Let us analyze this term. The most physically meaningful interpretation, consistent with accounting for work on the domain boundary, is that the integral represents the sum of contributions from both crack faces, $\\Gamma_c = \\Gamma_c^+ \\cup \\Gamma_c^-$. The term $t_i$ represents the traction exerted *by* the material body *on* the crack face.\n- On the upper face $\\Gamma_c^+$, the normal vector pointing out of the material is $(0,-1)$. The traction is $t_i^+ = \\sigma_{ij}n_j = -\\sigma_{i2}$.\n- On the lower face $\\Gamma_c^-$, the normal is $(0,1)$. The traction is $t_i^- = \\sigma_{i2}$.\nThe term is therefore:\n$$ \\int_{\\Gamma_c} t_i u_{i,1} \\, ds = \\int_{\\Gamma_c^+} t_i^+ u_{i,1}^+ \\, ds + \\int_{\\Gamma_c^-} t_i^- u_{i,1}^- \\, ds = \\int_{\\Gamma_c} (-\\sigma_{i2} u_{i,1}^+ + \\sigma_{i2} u_{i,1}^-) \\, dx_1 $$\n$$ = - \\int_{\\Gamma_c} \\sigma_{i2} (u_{i,1}^+ - u_{i,1}^-) \\, dx_1 = - \\int_{\\Gamma_c} \\sigma_{i2} (\\Delta u_i)_{,1} \\, dx_1 $$\nAgain, using $\\Delta u_2=0$, this simplifies to:\n$$ \\int_{\\Gamma_c} t_i u_{i,1} \\, ds = - \\int_{\\Gamma_c} \\sigma_{12} (\\Delta u_1)_{,1} \\, dx_1 $$\nNow let us examine the quantity proposed in Option C, $J_{\\mathrm{sub}} = J-\\int_{\\Gamma_c} t_i\\,u_{i,1}\\,ds$. If this quantity is to be path-independent, its value must be the same for $\\Gamma_1$ and $\\Gamma_2$. Let the integration path for the correction term run from the crack tip to the contour.\n$$ J_{sub}(\\Gamma) = J(\\Gamma) - \\left( - \\int_{-\\ell}^{\\Gamma} \\sigma_{12} (\\Delta u_1)_{,1} \\, ds \\right) = J(\\Gamma) + \\int_{-\\ell}^{\\Gamma} \\sigma_{12} (\\Delta u_1)_{,1} \\, ds $$\nThis is precisely the path-independent integral $J^*$ that we derived from first principles.\n\nTherefore, the quantity $J_{\\mathrm{sub}}$ is path-independent. Its value is the energy flux to the crack tip, which is the definition of the energy release rate, $G$. Thus, $G=J_\\mathrm{sub}$.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n- **A. The standard $J$-integral is path independent under all quasi-static conditions without body forces, even if crack faces carry contact and frictional tractions. Therefore $G=J$.**\n  **Incorrect**. The derivation explicitly shows that $J(\\Gamma_2) - J(\\Gamma_1) = - \\int_{\\Gamma_c} \\sigma_{12} (\\Delta u_1)_{,1} \\, dx_1 \\ne 0$ in the presence of friction. Path independence is lost.\n\n- **B. Path independence of the standard $J$ is lost when nonzero tractions act on crack faces between contours, but it is restored by adding the crack-face traction work term; a path-independent quantity is $J_{\\mathrm{add}}=J+\\int_{\\Gamma_c} t_i\\,u_{i,1}\\,ds$, and, under the stated assumptions, $G=J_{\\mathrm{add}}$.**\n  **Incorrect**. This option has the wrong sign. The proposed quantity would be $J_{\\mathrm{add}}(\\Gamma) = J(\\Gamma) - \\int_{-\\ell}^{\\Gamma} \\sigma_{12} (\\Delta u_1)_{,1} \\, ds$. This is not path-independent. Its change between contours $\\Gamma_1$ and $\\Gamma_2$ would be $-2\\int_{\\Gamma_c} \\sigma_{12} (\\Delta u_1)_{,1} \\, dx_1$.\n\n- **C. Path independence of the standard $J$ is lost when nonzero tractions act on crack faces between contours, but it is restored by subtracting the crack-face traction work term; a path-independent quantity is $J_{\\mathrm{sub}}=J-\\int_{\\Gamma_c} t_i\\,u_{i,1}\\,ds$, and, under the stated assumptions, $G=J_{\\mathrm{sub}}$.**\n  **Correct**. As demonstrated in the derivation, subtracting the term $\\int_{\\Gamma_c} t_i u_{i,1} ds$ (which is itself negative) is equivalent to adding the required positive correction term $\\int \\sigma_{12}(\\Delta u_1)_{,1} ds $. This restores path independence, and the resulting integral equals the energy release rate $G$.\n\n- **D. Because Coulomb friction is nonconservative, no path-independent modification of $J$ exists in the presence of crack-face contact; thus no contour integral can represent $G$.**\n  **Incorrect**. The non-conservative nature of friction is precisely what necessitates the correction. The dissipation occurs on the crack faces, while the bulk material remains hyperelastic. A path-independent integral can be, and has been, constructed by explicitly accounting for the work done by friction.\n\n- **E. Only frictional shear does nonconservative work, so the correct correction term retains only the shear component; a path-independent quantity is $J_{\\tau}=J-\\int_{\\Gamma_c} \\tau\\,u_{t,1}\\,ds$, where $\\tau$ is the tangential traction on the crack face and $u_{t,1}$ is the tangential component of $u_{i,1}$; the normal contact pressure term should be excluded by impenetrability.**\n  **Incorrect**. While it is true that only frictional shear causes the path dependence, the formulation of the integral term is imprecise and differs from the rigorously derived expression. The correct expression is $\\int t_i^c (\\Delta u_i)_{,1} ds $, which my analysis shows is equivalent to $-\\int_{\\Gamma_c} t_i u_{i,1} ds$ in its full form. Option C uses the full form, which correctly reduces to only the shear contribution upon evaluation, making it more general and formally correct. The term $u_{t,1}$ is ambiguous; it could mean $u_{1,1}$ on one face, which is not equivalent to $(\\Delta u_1)_{,1}$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2896492"}, {"introduction": "In modern engineering, the J-integral is most often computed numerically using methods like the finite element analysis.

The goal is to connect the J-integral to the energy release rate and to a stress-intensity-factor-based representation, then use this representation to produce a ground-truth value and controlled numerical perturbations that mimic mesh and contour-size effects.\n\nStart from the following fundamental base:\n- The J-integral is defined for a two-dimensional crack problem as a path integral of the form $J=\\int_{\\Gamma}\\left(W\\,n_{x}-\\mathbf{T}\\cdot\\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{u}}{\\partial x}\\right)ds$, where $W$ is the strain energy density, $\\mathbf{T}$ is the traction vector, $\\mathbf{u}$ is the displacement vector, $x$ is the crack extension direction, and $\\Gamma$ is a contour encircling the crack tip. For hyperelastic materials, $J$ is path-independent.\n- The energy release rate $G$ is defined by $G=-\\frac{d\\Pi}{da}$ at fixed external control, where $\\Pi$ is the total potential energy and $a$ is the crack length.\n- In linear elastic fracture mechanics under small-scale yielding, $J$ equals $G$ and can be expressed in terms of the mode-$I$ stress intensity factor $K_{I}$ as $J=G=\\frac{K_{I}^{2}}{E'}$, where for plane strain $E'=\\frac{E}{1-\\nu^{2}}$, with $E$ the Young’s modulus and $\\nu$ the Poisson’s ratio.\n\nUse a three-point bending Single Edge Notched Bending (SENB) specimen of width $W$, thickness $B$, span $S$, crack length $a$, and load $P$. The mode-$I$ stress intensity factor can be written as $K_{I}=\\frac{P\\,S}{B\\,W^{3/2}}\\,f\\left(\\frac{a}{W}\\right)$, where $f(\\cdot)$ is the standard dimensionless geometry function for SENB. You must base your derivation on the fundamental definitions above and well-tested SENB relations so that your program can compute a ground-truth $J$ for given inputs.\n\nTo emulate a mesh convergence study of the domain-type J-integral with circular contours of radius $r$ around the crack tip, assume the synthetic observation model\n$$\nJ_{\\text{obs}}(r)=J_{\\star}\\left[1+A\\left(\\frac{r}{W}\\right)^{p_{\\text{true}}}+B\\left(\\frac{r}{W}\\right)^{p_{\\text{true}}+1}\\right],\n$$\nwhere $J_{\\star}$ is the true path-independent value (equal to $G$ in linear elasticity), $A$ and $B$ are dimensionless constants that encode leading and subleading error contributions, and $p_{\\text{true}}$ is the underlying convergence order of the numerical scheme.

It presents a numerical study based on the foundational principles of linear elastic fracture mechanics (LEFM). The definitions of the J-integral $J$, energy release rate $G$, and their relation to the mode-$I$ stress intensity factor $K_I$ are correct. The problem specifies a standard SENB specimen and provides the general form of the $K_I$ formula. While the specific geometry function $f(a/W)$ is not given, the problem states that a \"well-tested\" relation should be used. The provided test cases all have a span-to-width ratio $S/W = 4$, for which a standard, precise polynomial expression for $f(a/W)$ is available in literature, such as in the ASTM E399 standard. The use of a synthetic data model to simulate numerical error is a valid and common technique in computational mechanics for studying convergence properties. The aask to fit a simplified model to this data is a standard parameter estimation problem. The provided material properties, dimensions, and loads are physically realistic. The problem is self-contained (with the reasonable expectation of using a standard formula), internally consistent, and computationally feasible. It does not violate any of the invalidity criteria.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is deemed **valid**. A solution will be formulated and implemented.\n\n**Principle-Based Solution Derivation**\n\nThe core of the problem is to determine an observed convergence rate $p$ by fitting a model to synthetically generated data that mimics the numerical evaluation of the J-integral. This involves three main stages: calculating the ground-truth J-integral, generating the synthetic \"observed\" data, and performing a nonlinear regression to estimate $p$.\n\n**1. Calculation of the Ground-Truth J-integral ($J_{\\star}$)**\nUnder LEFM conditions, the path-independent J-integral is equivalent to the energy release rate, $J = G$. For a mode-$I$ crack, this is related to the stress intensity factor $K_I$ by the equation:\n$$\nJ_{\\star} = \\frac{K_I^2}{E'}\n$$\nwhere $E'$ is the effective Young's modulus. For the specified plane strain condition, it is given by:\n$$\nE' = \\frac{E}{1 - \\nu^2}\n$$\nThe stress intensity factor $K_I$ for an SENB specimen is given in the problem as:\n$$\nK_{I} = \\frac{P S}{B W^{3/2}} f\\left(\\frac{a}{W}\\right)\n$$\nAll test cases have a span-to-width ratio $S/W=4$. For this geometry, the standard dimensionless function $f(x)$ for $x=a/W$, as defined in ASTM E399-90, is:\n$$\nf(x) = \\frac{3 \\sqrt{x} \\left[1.99 - x(1-x)(2.15 - 3.93x + 2.7x^2)\\right]}{2 (1+2x)(1-x)^{3/2}}\n$$\nThis well-established formula will be used to compute $f(a/W)$ for each test case. Before calculation, all input parameters ($E$, $B$, $W$, $S$, $P$, $r$) must be converted to a consistent system of units, specifically the base SI units (Pascals, meters, Newtons).\n\n**2. Generation of Synthetic J-integral Data ($J_{\\text{obs}}$)**\nThe problem provides a synthetic model to emulate the results of a numerical J-integral evaluation over contours of varying radii $r$. This model introduces controlled \"errors\" to the true value $J_{\\star}$:\n$$\nJ_{\\text{obs}}(r) = J_{\\star}\\left[1 + A\\left(\\frac{r}{W}\\right)^{p_{\\text{true}}} + B\\left(\\frac{r}{W}\\right)^{p_{\\text{true}}+1}\\right]\n$$\nHere, $A$, $B$, and $p_{\\text{true}}$ are given constants for each test case. The term with coefficient $A$ represents the leading-order error, while the term with $B$ represents a higher-order error contribution. We will generate $4$ data points $(r/W, J_{\\text{obs}})$ for each test case using the provided list of radii $r$.\n\n**3. Estimation of Observed Convergence Order ($p$)**\nThe final step is to analyze the synthetic data to extract the observed convergence rate. This is done by fitting the following reduced model to the generated $(r/W, J_{\\text{obs}})$ data pairs:\n$$\nJ_{\\text{fit}}(r) = J_{0} + C\\left(\\frac{r}{W}\\right)^{p}\n$$\nThis is a nonlinear regression problem with three unknown parameters: $J_0$, which should approximate the true value $J_{\\star}$; $C$, which is a scaling factor for the error term; and $p$, the observed convergence order. The goal is to find the value of $p$ that provides the best fit in a least-squares sense.\n\nThis task is accomplished using a numerical optimization routine. The `curve_fit` function from Python's `scipy.optimize` library is ideally suited for this purpose. It requires the definition of the model function to be fitted, the independent variable data ($x_i = r_i/W$), the dependent variable data ($y_i = J_{\\text{obs}}(r_i)$), and initial guesses for the parameters $(J_0, C, p)$. Good initial guesses are crucial for the stability and success of the nonlinear fitting algorithm. Based on the structure of the problem, we can formulate strong guesses:\n- Initial guess for $J_0$: The true value $J_{\\star}$.\n- Initial guess for $p$: The true convergence order $p_{\\text{true}}$.\n- Initial guess for $C$: Comparing the fitting model with the data generation model, we see that for small $r/W$, $J_{\\text{obs}} - J_{\\star} \\approx J_{\\star} A (r/W)^{p_{\\text{true}}}$ and $J_{\\text{fit}} - J_0 \\approx C(r/W)^p$. Thus, a reasonable guess for $C$ is $J_{\\star} \\cdot A$.\n\nThe `curve_fit` function will return the optimal values for $(J_0, C, p)$. The third parameter in this returned tuple is our desired result, the observed convergence rate $p$, which will be rounded to $3$ decimal places as required. The entire procedure is repeated for each of the $3$ test cases.", "answer": "```python\n# The complete and runnable Python 3 code goes here.\n# Imports must adhere to the specified execution environment.\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy.optimize import curve_fit\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves the J-integral convergence analysis problem for a set of test cases.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Define the test cases from the problem statement.\n    test_cases = [\n        {\n            # Case 1 (typical, quadratic-like convergence)\n            \"E_GPa\": 210, \"nu\": 0.30, \"B_mm\": 10, \"W_mm\": 40, \"S_mm\": 160,\n            \"a_W_ratio\": 0.50, \"P_N\": 3000,\n            \"radii_mm\": [0.5, 1.0, 2.0, 4.0],\n            \"A\": 0.5, \"B\": -0.2, \"p_true\": 2.0\n        },\n        {\n            # Case 2 (sub-quadratic convergence)\n            \"E_GPa\": 70, \"nu\": 0.33, \"B_mm\": 8, \"W_mm\": 32, \"S_mm\": 128,\n            \"a_W_ratio\": 0.20, \"P_N\": 1500,\n            \"radii_mm\": [0.25, 0.50, 1.0, 2.0],\n            \"A\": 0.3, \"B\": 0.1, \"p_true\": 1.5\n        },\n        {\n            # Case 3 (linear-like convergence)\n            \"E_GPa\": 110, \"nu\": 0.29, \"B_mm\": 12, \"W_mm\": 48, \"S_mm\": 192,\n            \"a_W_ratio\": 0.60, \"P_N\": 5000,\n            \"radii_mm\": [0.6, 1.2, 2.4, 4.8],\n            \"A\": -0.4, \"B\": 0.0, \"p_true\": 1.0\n        }\n    ]\n\n    results = []\n\n    # Standard geometry function f(a/W) for SENB specimen with S/W = 4\n    # from ASTM E399-90.\n    def senb_geometry_function(x):\n        \"\"\"Calculates the dimensionless geometry function f(a/W) for SENB.\"\"\"\n        num = 3 * np.sqrt(x) * (1.99 - x * (1 - x) * (2.15 - 3.93 * x + 2.7 * x**2))\n        den = 2 * (1 + 2 * x) * (1 - x)**1.5\n        return num / den\n\n    # Fitting model for the nonlinear least-squares regression.\n    def fit_model(x_norm, J0, C, p):\n        \"\"\"Model J_obs(r) ≈ J0 + C * (r/W)^p.\"\"\"\n        return J0 + C * x_norm**p\n\n    for case in test_cases:\n        # Convert all inputs to base SI units (meters, Pascals, Newtons).\n        E = case[\"E_GPa\"] * 1e9  # GPa to Pa\n        nu = case[\"nu\"]\n        B = case[\"B_mm\"] * 1e-3  # mm to m\n        W = case[\"W_mm\"] * 1e-3  # mm to m\n        S = case[\"S_mm\"] * 1e-3  # mm to m\n        a_W_ratio = case[\"a_W_ratio\"]\n        P = case[\"P_N\"]\n        radii = np.array(case[\"radii_mm\"]) * 1e-3  # mm to m\n        A = case[\"A\"]\n        B_err = case[\"B\"]\n        p_true = case[\"p_true\"]\n\n        # 1.
