The polynomial traction-separation law is a standard, albeit simplified, model used to represent brittle fracture. The definition of fracture energy as the area under the traction-separation curve is fundamental to this framework.\n-   **Well-Posed**: The problem is well-posed. It requires the computation of a definite integral of a well-defined, piecewise continuous function. All necessary parameters ($\\sigma_c$, $\\delta_c$) and functional forms are provided. A unique, stable, and meaningful solution exists.\n-   **Objective**: The language is precise, mathematical, and free of any subjective or ambiguous terminology.\n\nThe problem does not exhibit any invalidating flaws. It is a direct and formalizable problem in applied mechanics and mathematics.\n\nStep 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is deemed valid. A solution will be formulated.\n\nThe task is to derive the expression for the Mode I fracture energy, $G_I$, by integrating the given traction-separation law, $t_n(\\delta_n)$, over the entire separation process. The definition provided is:\n$$G_I = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} t_n(\\delta_n)\\, \\mathrm{d}\\delta_n$$\nThe function $t_n(\\delta_n)$ is defined piecewise. We can therefore split the integral into two parts corresponding to the two domains of the definition:\n$$G_I = \\int_{0}^{\\delta_c} t_n(\\delta_n)\\, \\mathrm{d}\\delta_n + \\int_{\\delta_c}^{\\infty} t_n(\\delta_n)\\, \\mathrm{d}\\delta_n$$\nAccording to the problem statement, for $\\delta_n  \\delta_c$, the traction $t_n(\\delta_n)$ is equal to $0$. Consequently, the second integral evaluates to zero:\n$$\\int_{\\delta_c}^{\\infty} 0 \\, \\mathrm{d}\\delta_n = 0$$\nThis leaves only the integral from $0$ to $\\delta_c$. We substitute the polynomial expression for $t_n(\\delta_n)$ into this integral:\n$$G_I = \\int_{0}^{\\delta_c} \\sigma_c\\left(1 - 2\\frac{\\delta_n}{\\delta_c} + \\left(\\frac{\\delta_n}{\\delta_c}\\right)^{2}\\right)\\, \\mathrm{d}\\delta_n$$\nThe cohesive strength $\\sigma_c$ is a constant and can be factored out of the integral:\n$$G_I = \\sigma_c \\int_{0}^{\\delta_c} \\left(1 - \\frac{2}{\\delta_c}\\delta_n + \\frac{1}{\\delta_c^2}\\delta_n^2\\right)\\, \\mathrm{d}\\delta_n$$\nWe now perform the integration with respect to the separation variable $\\delta_n$:\n$$G_I = \\sigma_c \\left[ \\delta_n - \\frac{2}{\\delta_c}\\frac{\\delta_n^2}{2} + \\frac{1}{\\delta_c^2}\\frac{\\delta_n^3}{3} \\right]_{0}^{\\delta_c}$$\nSimplifying the expression inside the brackets gives:\n$$G_I = \\sigma_c \\left[ \\delta_n - \\frac{\\delta_n^2}{\\delta_c} + \\frac{\\delta_n^3}{3\\delta_c^2} \\right]_{0}^{\\delta_c}$$\nNow, we evaluate the definite integral by applying the fundamental theorem of calculus. We substitute the upper limit $\\delta_c$ and subtract the result of substituting the lower limit $0$:\n$$G_I = \\sigma_c \\left( \\left( \\delta_c - \\frac{\\delta_c^2}{\\delta_c} + \\frac{\\delta_c^3}{3\\delta_c^2} \\right) - \\left( 0 - \\frac{0^2}{\\delta_c} + \\frac{0^3}{3\\delta_c^2} \\right) \\right)$$\nThe terms from the lower limit are all zero. Simplifying the terms from the upper limit:\n$$G_I = \\sigma_c \\left( \\delta_c - \\delta_c + \\frac{\\delta_c}{3} \\right)$$\nThe first two terms cancel each other out:\n$$G_I = \\sigma_c \\left(\\frac{\\delta_c}{3}\\right)$$\nThis yields the final closed-form expression for the Mode I fracture energy:\n$$G_I = \\frac{1}{3}\\sigma_c\\delta_c$$\n\nPhysical Interpretation:\nThe fracture energy $G_I$ represents the total energy dissipated per unit area of crack surface created. The derived expression, $G_I = \\frac{1}{3}\\sigma_c\\delta_c$, relates this energy to the two fundamental parameters of the cohesive law: the cohesive strength $\\sigma_c$ (the maximum stress the interface can withstand) and the critical separation $\\delta_c$ (the separation distance at which the interface fails completely). The product $\\sigma_c\\delta_c$ defines the area of a bounding rectangle for the traction-separation curve. The factor of $\\frac{1}{3}$ is a shape factor that arises directly from the quadratic nature of the specified cohesive law. For comparison, a simple linear (triangular) cohesive law would yield a shape factor of $\\frac{1}{2}$. The shape of the given law, which can be written as $t_n(\\delta_n) = \\sigma_c(1-\\delta_n/\\delta_c)^2$, is characterized by a non-zero initial softening slope ($t_n'(0) = -2\\sigma_c/\\delta_c$) and a zero slope at complete failure ($t_n'(\\delta_c)=0$). This signifies a softening behavior where the rate of strength degradation decreases as the separation approaches its critical value. The specific shape of the traction's decay dictates the total energy that must be expended to achieve fracture, and for this particular model, that energy is precisely one-third of the product of the peak stress and the critical separation.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{1}{3}\\sigma_c\\delta_c}$$", "id": "2871465"}, {"introduction": "While analyzing a given cohesive law is instructive, a more common engineering task is to construct a model that reproduces known material properties.

The corresponding interfacial interpenetration is $\\delta = \\sigma / K_{0} = -p_{\\max} / K_{0}$. The magnitude of this interpenetration is $|\\delta| = p_{\\max} / K_{0}$. The constraint requires this magnitude to not exceed $\\delta_{\\text{allow}}$:\n$$ |\\delta| = \\frac{p_{\\max}}{K_{0}} \\le \\delta_{\\text{allow}} $$\nThis inequality yields a lower bound on $K_{0}$:\n$$ K_{0} \\ge \\frac{p_{\\max}}{\\delta_{\\text{allow}}} $$\n\nConstraint 2: Artificial compliance limit.\nThe total compliance of the structure is $C_{\\text{total}} = d\\Delta/d\\sigma$. From the relation $\\Delta = \\sigma(L/E + 1/K_{0})$, we find:\n$$ C_{\\text{total}} = \\frac{L}{E} + \\frac{1}{K_{0}} $$\nThis total compliance is the sum of the bulk compliance, $C_{\\text{bulk}} = L/E$, and the compliance introduced by the interface, $C_{\\text{interface}} = 1/K_{0}$. The constraint states that the artificial compliance from the interface must not exceed a fraction $\\eta$ of the bulk compliance:\n$$ C_{\\text{interface}} \\le \\eta C_{\\text{bulk}} $$\nSubstituting the expressions for the compliances:\n$$ \\frac{1}{K_{0}} \\le \\eta \\frac{L}{E} $$\nThis gives a second lower bound on $K_{0}$:\n$$ K_{0} \\ge \\frac{E}{\\eta L} $$\nTo satisfy both constraints simultaneously, $K_{0}$ must be greater than or equal to both lower bounds. The minimal required cohesive stiffness is the maximum of these two bounds:\n$$ K_{0, \\text{min}} = \\max\\left(\\frac{p_{\\max}}{\\delta_{\\text{allow}}}, \\frac{E}{\\eta L}\\right) $$\nThe two constraints formalize the need for a sufficiently high cohesive stiffness $K_{0}$. A high $K_{0}$ ensures that under compressive loading, non-physical interpenetration is limited (Constraint 1), and that the overall structural response is not unduly softened by the presence of the interface, thus maintaining modeling fidelity to a nearly monolithic body (Constraint 2). The design task is to find the minimum $K_{0}$ that is \"stiff enough\" to satisfy both a performance criterion (interpenetration) and a modeling fidelity criterion (compliance).\n\nPart 3: Numerical Evaluation\n\nWe evaluate the minimal stiffness $K_{0, \\text{min}}$ and the corresponding sensitivity $S(K_{0, \\text{min}})$ using the numerical values: $L=0.50\\,\\text{m}$, $E=210\\,\\text{GPa}=210 \\times 10^{9}\\,\\text{Pa}$, $p_{\\max}=100\\,\\text{MPa}=100 \\times 10^{6}\\,\\text{Pa}$, $\\delta_{\\text{allow}}=1.0\\times 10^{-7}\\,\\text{m}$, and $\\eta=0.050$.\n\nFirst, we calculate the two lower bounds for $K_{0}$.\nFrom the interpenetration constraint:\n$$ K_{0,1} = \\frac{p_{\\max}}{\\delta_{\\text{allow}}} = \\frac{100 \\times 10^{6}\\,\\text{Pa}}{1.0 \\times 10^{-7}\\,\\text{m}} = 1.0 \\times 10^{15}\\,\\text{Pa}\\,\\text{m}^{-1} $$\nFrom the artificial compliance constraint:\n$$ K_{0,2} = \\frac{E}{\\eta L} = \\frac{210 \\times 10^{9}\\,\\text{Pa}}{0.050 \\times 0.50\\,\\text{m}} = \\frac{210 \\times 10^{9}\\,\\text{Pa}}{0.025\\,\\text{m}} = 8.4 \\times 10^{12}\\,\\text{Pa}\\,\\text{m}^{-1} $$\nThe minimal allowable stiffness is the maximum of these two values:\n$$ K_{0, \\text{min}} = \\max(1.0 \\times 10^{15}, 8.4 \\times 10^{12})\\,\\text{Pa}\\,\\text{m}^{-1} = 1.0 \\times 10^{15}\\,\\text{Pa}\\,\\text{m}^{-1} $$\nThe interpenetration constraint is the governing one.\n\nNow, we evaluate the sensitivity $S$ at this value of $K_{0, \\text{min}}$ using the derived expression $S(K_{0}) = (1 + K_{0}L/E)^{-1}$.
