A solution will be provided.\n\nThe J-integral is a measure of the energy release rate in a material, applicable to both elastic and elastic-plastic behavior. For a stationary crack under monotonic loading, it can be calculated from a single load-displacement record. The total J-integral is decomposed into an elastic component, $J_{el}$, and a plastic component, $J_{pl}$.\n$$J = J_{el} + J_{pl}$$\nThis decomposition is central to the procedure.\n\n**1) Derivation of the Computational Procedure**\n\nThe elastic component, $J_{el}$, is equivalent to the linear-elastic energy release rate, $G$. Under plane strain conditions, this is related to the Mode I stress intensity factor, $K_I$, by:\n$$J_{el} = G = \\frac{K_I^2 (1-\\nu^2)}{E}$$\nThe stress intensity factor $K_I$ is calculated at the final load $P_f$ using the provided formula:\n$$K_I = \\frac{P_f}{B W} \\sqrt{\\pi a_0} F\\left(\\frac{a_0}{W}\\right)$$\n\nThe plastic component, $J_{pl}$, is related to the energy dissipated by plastic deformation. The $\\eta$-factor method provides a practical means to calculate this from the load-displacement curve:\n$$J_{pl} = \\frac{\\eta A_{pl}}{B(W-a_0)}$$\nHere, $B(W-a_0)$ is the cross-sectional area of the remaining ligament, and $A_{pl}$ is the plastic work. The problem states that the plastic work is to be computed as the difference between the total work of loading, $A_{total}$, and the elastic work (strain energy) stored at the final load, $A_{el}$.\n\nThe total work done on the specimen, which corresponds to the total area under the load-displacement curve, is calculated by integrating the measured data:\n$$A_{total} = \\int_0^{u_f} P(u) du$$\nGiven the discrete data points, this integral is approximated using the trapezoidal rule.\n\nThe elastic strain energy, $A_{el}$, at the final load $P_f$ is calculated assuming a linear elastic response governed by the initial compliance $C_0$. This energy corresponds to the area of a triangle with base $u_{el,f} = C_0 P_f$ and height $P_f$:\n$$A_{el} = \\frac{1}{2} P_f u_{el,f} = \\frac{1}{2} C_0 P_f^2$$\nThe plastic work is therefore:\n$$A_{pl} = A_{total} - A_{el} = \\left( \\int_0^{u_f} P(u) du \\right) - \\frac{1}{2} C_0 P_f^2$$\nCombining these elements gives the complete procedure for calculating the total J-integral at the final recorded point.\n\n**2) Application of the Procedure**\n\nWe will perform all calculations in base SI units (meters, Newtons, Pascals, Joules).\n- $B = 0.01\\,\\text{m}$\n- $W = 0.04\\,\\text{m}$\n- $a_0 = 0.016\\,\\text{m}$\n- $E = 210 \\times 10^9\\,\\text{Pa}$\n- $\\nu = 0.30$\n- $P_f = 28.0\\,\\text{kN} = 2.8 \\times 10^4\\,\\text{N}$\n- $C_0 = 0.0100\\,\\text{mm/kN} = 0.0100 \\times \\frac{10^{-3}\\,\\text{m}}{10^3\\,\\text{N}} = 1.0 \\times 10^{-8}\\,\\text{m/N}$\n- $\\eta = 1.90$\n\n**Calculation of the Elastic Component, $J_{el}$**\nFirst, we evaluate the geometry function $F(x)$ at $x = a_0/W = 0.016/0.04 = 0.4$:\n$$F(0.4) = 1.12 - 0.231(0.4) + 10.55(0.4)^2 - 21.72(0.4)^3 + 30.39(0.4)^4$$\n$$F(0.4) = 1.12 - 0.0924 + 10.55(0.16) - 21.72(0.064) + 30.39(0.0256)$$\n$$F(0.4) = 1.12 - 0.0924 + 1.688 - 1.39008 + 0.777984 = 2.103504$$\nNext, calculate the nominal stress $\\sigma$ at the final load $P_f = 2.8 \\times 10^4\\,\\text{N}$:\n$$\\sigma = \\frac{P_f}{B W} = \\frac{2.8 \\times 10^4\\,\\text{N}}{(0.01\\,\\text{m})(0.04\\,\\text{m})} = 7.0 \\times 10^7\\,\\text{Pa}$$\nNow, we compute $K_I$:\n$$K_I = (7.0 \\times 10^7\\,\\text{Pa}) \\sqrt{\\pi (0.016\\,\\text{m})} \\times (2.103504)$$\n$$K_I \\approx (7.0 \\times 10^7) \\times (0.22420) \\times (2.103504) \\approx 3.3000 \\times 10^7\\,\\text{Pa}\\sqrt{\\text{m}}$$\nFinally, we calculate $J_{el}$:\n$$J_{el} = \\frac{K_I^2 (1-\\nu^2)}{E} = \\frac{(3.3000 \\times 10^7\\,\\text{Pa}\\sqrt{\\text{m}})^2 (1 - 0.30^2)}{210 \\times 10^9\\,\\text{Pa}}$$\n$$J_{el} = \\frac{(1.0890 \\times 10^{15}) (0.91)}{2.10 \\times 10^{11}} \\approx 4719.1\\,\\text{J/m}^2$$\n\n**Calculation of the Plastic Component, $J_{pl}$**\nFirst, we compute the total work $A_{total}$ by applying the trapezoidal rule to the $(u,P)$ data.

It is not ill-posed; the definitions are clear and the procedure is unambiguous.\n6.  It is not trivial or pseudo-profound. It represents a standard numerical analysis task in its domain. The case with $Q=0$ provides a valuable baseline check, which correctly yields $\\mathcal{D}=0$, confirming the theoretical expectation.\n7.  The entire calculation is numerically verifiable.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\n\nThe problem is **valid**. A solution will be provided.\n\n---\n\nThe objective is to compute a deviation metric $\\mathcal{D}$ that quantifies the departure from HRR similarity for a crack-tip stress field affected by constraint loss. The computation will be performed for three distinct cases. The procedure is as follows for each case tuple $(J, \\sigma_0, n, Q, \\lambda)$.\n\nFirst, we establish the characteristic length scale, $r_0$. The units of $J$ are given as $\\mathrm{N/mm}$ and $\\sigma_0$ are given as $\\mathrm{MPa}$. Noting that $1\\ \\mathrm{MPa} = 1\\ \\mathrm{N/mm^2}$, the units are consistent. The characteristic length is computed as:\n$$\nr_0 = \\frac{J}{\\sigma_0}\n$$\nThe result for $r_0$ will be in units of $\\mathrm{mm}$.\n\nSecond, we define the radial domain for analysis. The problem specifies a logarithmic sampling of $N_r = 400$ points for the radius $r$ over the annulus $[r_{\\min}, r_{\\max}]$, where:\n$$\nr_{\\min} = 0.1 \\, r_0\n$$\n$$\nr_{\\max} = 10 \\, r_0\n$$\nA logarithmic distribution is appropriate for resolving fields that vary with a power of the radius, which is characteristic of crack-tip mechanics.\n\nThird, for each sampled radius $r$, we compute the equivalent stress $\\sigma_{\\mathrm{eq}}(r)$ using the provided two-parameter model:\n$$\n\\sigma_{\\mathrm{eq}}(r) = \\sigma_0 \\left( \\frac{J}{\\sigma_0 r} \\right)^{\\tfrac{1}{n+1}} + Q \\, \\sigma_0 \\, \\exp\\!\\left( -\\lambda \\, \\frac{r}{r_0} \\right)\n$$\nFor cases with negative $Q$, which model loss of constraint, the second term is negative. This can, in principle, lead to a non-physical negative equivalent stress. The problem statement correctly mandates that any such negative value be replaced by a small positive floor, for instance $10^{-10}$, to ensure numerical stability and physical admissibility.\n\nFourth, we compute the dimensionless similarity function $S(r)$ for each radius $r$:\n$$\nS(r) = \\frac{\\sigma_{\\mathrm{eq}}(r)}{\\sigma_0} \\left( \\frac{r \\, \\sigma_0}{J} \\right)^{\\tfrac{1}{n+1}}\n$$\nBy substituting the expression for $\\sigma_{\\mathrm{eq}}(r)$ and the definition $r_0 = J/\\sigma_0$, we can derive a simplified analytical expression for $S(r)$:\n$$\nS(r) = \\frac{1}{\\sigma_0} \\left[ \\sigma_0 \\left( \\frac{J}{\\sigma_0 r} \\right)^{\\tfrac{1}{n+1}} + Q \\, \\sigma_0 \\, \\exp\\!\\left( -\\lambda \\, \\frac{r}{r_0} \\right) \\right] \\left( \\frac{r \\, \\sigma_0}{J} \\right)^{\\tfrac{1}{n+1}}\n$$\n$$\nS(r) = \\left[ \\left( \\frac{J}{\\sigma_0 r} \\right)^{\\tfrac{1}{n+1}} + Q \\, \\exp\\!\\left( -\\lambda \\, \\frac{r}{r_0} \\right) \\right] \\left( \\frac{r}{J/\\sigma_0} \\right)^{\\tfrac{1}{n+1}}\n$$\n$$\nS(r) = \\left[ \\left( \\frac{r_0}{r} \\right)^{\\tfrac{1}{n+1}} + Q \\, \\exp\\!\\left( -\\lambda \\, \\frac{r}{r_0} \\right) \\right] \\left( \\frac{r}{r_0} \\right)^{\\tfrac{1}{n+1}}\n$$\n$$\nS(r) = 1 + Q \\left( \\frac{r}{r_0} \\right)^{\\tfrac{1}{n+1}} \\exp\\!\\left( -\\lambda \\, \\frac{r}{r_0} \\right)\n$$\nWhile this simplified form is elegant, the numerical implementation must follow the specified procedure of first calculating $\\sigma_{\\mathrm{eq}}(r)$ and applying the non-negativity constraint before calculating $S(r)$.\n\nFifth, the reference similarity level, $S_{\\mathrm{ref}}$, is taken as the value of $S(r)$ at the smallest radius in our sampled domain:\n$$\nS_{\\mathrm{ref}} = S(r_{\\min})\n$$\nThis serves as a proxy for the far-field-independent, near-tip value of the similarity function.\n\nFinally, the deviation metric $\\mathcal{D}$ is calculated as the maximum absolute relative deviation of $S(r)$ from $S_{\\mathrm{ref}}$ over the entire sampled annulus:\n$$\n\\mathcal{D} = \\max_{r \\in [r_{\\min}, r_{\\max}]} \\left| \\frac{S(r)}{S_{\\mathrm{ref}}} - 1 \\right|\n$$\nThis procedure is repeated for each of the three test cases, and the resulting values of $\\mathcal{D}$ are reported in the specified format. For Case A, where $Q=0$, the stress field is purely of the HRR type. From the definition of $S(r)$, it is clear that if $\\sigma_{\\mathrm{eq}}(r)$ is the HRR term alone, then $S(r)$ evaluates to exactly $1$ for all $r$. Thus, $S_{\\mathrm{ref}}=1$, and the deviation $|S(r)/S_{\\mathrm{ref}}-1| = |1/1 - 1| = 0$ for all $r$. The maximum deviation $\\mathcal{D}$ must therefore be $0$. This provides a check on the correctness of the implementation.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Computes the deviation from HRR similarity for a two-parameter crack-tip field.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Test cases: (J, sigma_0, n, Q, lambda)\n    # J in N/mm, sigma_0 in MPa (N/mm^2)\n    test_cases = [\n        # Case A (high constraint, HRR-like)\n        (300.0, 600.0, 5.0, 0.0, 1.0),\n        # Case B (moderate constraint loss)\n        (300.0, 600.0, 5.0, -0.5, 1.0),\n        # Case C (severe constraint loss with slower decay)\n        (300.0, 600.0, 5.0, -1.0, 0.5),\n    ]\n\n    # Number of radial sampling points\n    Nr = 400\n    # Small positive floor for non-negativity enforcement\n    STRESS_FLOOR = 1e-10\n\n    results = []\n\n    for case in test_cases:\n        J, sigma_0, n, Q, lam = case\n\n        # 1.
