The concepts used—von Mises stress, mean stress, plastic flow, porosity, and an associative flow rule—are fundamental to plasticity theory. The provided parameters ($q_1, q_2$) are typical values used in the literature. The problem sets up a comparison between two well-defined, albeit idealized, homogeneous stress states, which is a standard method for probing model behavior. The problem is objective, self-contained, and well-posed for a qualitative analysis of the model's predictions. No scientific or logical flaws are identified. The setup, while simplified (e.g., neglecting nucleation), is consistent and allows for a meaningful solution to be derived from first principles of the model.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem statement is **valid**. A solution will be derived.\n\n### Derivation\nThe analysis begins with the fundamental equations of the Gurson–Tvergaard–Needleman (GTN) model. The yield function, $\\Phi$, for a porous solid is given by:\n$$\n\\Phi(\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}, f, \\sigma_y) = \\left(\\frac{\\sigma_{eq}}{\\sigma_y}\\right)^2 + 2 q_1 f^* \\cosh\\left(\\frac{q_2 \\sigma_m}{ \\sigma_y}\\right) - (1 + (q_1 f^*)^2) = 0\n$$\nHere, $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}$ is the macroscopic Cauchy stress tensor, $\\sigma_{eq} = \\sqrt{\\frac{3}{2}\\mathbf{s}:\\mathbf{s}}$ is the macroscopic von Mises equivalent stress (where $\\mathbf{s}$ is the deviatoric stress tensor), and $\\sigma_m = \\frac{1}{3}\\text{tr}(\\boldsymbol{\\sigma})$ is the macroscopic mean stress. $\\sigma_y$ is the current yield stress of the matrix material, and $f^*$ is the effective void volume fraction. The problem specifies that for small porosity $f$, we can approximate $f^* \\approx f$. The constants $q_1 = 1.5$ and $q_2 = 1.0$ are the Tvergaard parameters.\n\nThe problem specifies an associated flow rule, which dictates that the plastic strain rate tensor, $\\dot{\\boldsymbol{\\epsilon}}_p$, is normal to the yield surface:\n$$\n\\dot{\\boldsymbol{\\epsilon}}_p = \\dot{\\lambda} \\frac{\\partial \\Phi}{\\partial \\boldsymbol{\\sigma}}\n$$\nwhere $\\dot{\\lambda} \\ge 0$ is the plastic multiplier. The rate of plastic work done per unit volume is $\\dot{W}_p = \\boldsymbol{\\sigma} : \\dot{\\boldsymbol{\\epsilon}}_p = \\dot{\\lambda} \\boldsymbol{\\sigma} : \\frac{\\partial \\Phi}{\\partial \\boldsymbol{\\sigma}}$.\n\nThe evolution of porosity is governed by two mechanisms: nucleation of new voids and growth of existing voids. The problem statement instructs to neglect nucleation. Since the matrix material is plastically incompressible, any plastic volume change of the aggregate must be due to the growth of voids. The law for void growth is:\n$$\n\\dot{f} = (1-f) \\dot{\\epsilon}_{p,kk}\n$$\nwhere $\\dot{\\epsilon}_{p,kk} = \\text{tr}(\\dot{\\boldsymbol{\\epsilon}}_p)$ is the plastic volumetric strain rate (or plastic dilatation rate). We must now determine this rate from the flow rule.\n$$\n\\dot{\\epsilon}_{p,kk} = \\text{tr}(\\dot{\\boldsymbol{\\epsilon}}_p) = \\text{tr}\\left( \\dot{\\lambda} \\frac{\\partial \\Phi}{\\partial \\boldsymbol{\\sigma}} \\right) = \\dot{\\lambda} \\, \\text{tr}\\left(\\frac{\\partial \\Phi}{\\partial \\boldsymbol{\\sigma}}\\right)\n$$\nUsing the chain rule, $\\frac{\\partial \\Phi}{\\partial \\boldsymbol{\\sigma}} = \\frac{\\partial \\Phi}{\\partial \\sigma_m} \\frac{\\partial \\sigma_m}{\\partial \\boldsymbol{\\sigma}} + \\frac{\\partial \\Phi}{\\partial \\sigma_{eq}} \\frac{\\partial \\sigma_{eq}}{\\partial \\boldsymbol{\\sigma}}$.

It shows that for a given plastic flow rate (characterized by $\\dot{\\lambda}>0$), the void growth rate $\\dot{f}$ is directly proportional to $\\sinh(\\frac{q_2 \\sigma_m}{\\sigma_y})$. The hyperbolic sine function, $\\sinh(x)$, is a strictly increasing function of its argument $x$.\n\nWe now compare the two specified stress states, $\\mathcal{S}_1$ and $\\mathcal{S}_2$. Both states have the same macroscopic equivalent stress, $\\sigma_{eq} = \\sigma_y$, but different mean stresses. We assume monotonic loading continues, which physically implies that plastic deformation occurs, so $\\dot{\\lambda} > 0$.\n- **State $\\mathcal{S}_1$ (pure shear):** $\\sigma_{m,1} = 0$.\nThe argument of the hyperbolic sine function is zero.\n$$ \\sinh\\left(\\frac{q_2 \\cdot 0}{\\sigma_y}\\right) = \\sinh(0) = 0 $$\nTherefore, for State $\\mathcal{S}_1$, the plastic volumetric strain rate $\\dot{\\epsilon}_{p,kk,1} = 0$, and the void growth rate is $\\dot{f_1} = 0$.\n\n- **State $\\mathcal{S}_2$ (uniaxial tension):** $\\sigma_{m,2} = \\sigma_y/3$.\nSince $\\sigma_y > 0$ and $q_2 = 1.0 > 0$, the argument of the hyperbolic sine function is positive.\n$$ \\sinh\\left(\\frac{q_2 \\cdot \\sigma_y/3}{\\sigma_y}\\right) = \\sinh\\left(\\frac{1.0}{3}\\right) > 0 $$\nTherefore, for State $\\mathcal{S}_2$, the plastic volumetric strain rate $\\dot{\\epsilon}_{p,kk,2} > 0$, and the void growth rate is $\\dot{f_2} > 0$.\n\nThe comparison is unambiguous: $\\dot{f_2} > \\dot{f_1}$. The state with higher mean stress (uniaxial tension) produces a significantly larger instantaneous void growth rate than the state with zero mean stress (pure shear), where the growth rate is predicted to be zero.\n\nVoid coalescence is a failure mechanism that is typically assumed to initiate when the void volume fraction $f$ reaches a critical value $f_c$. A larger instantaneous growth rate $\\dot{f}$ means that this critical value $f_c$ will be reached more rapidly (i.e., in less time or for a smaller increment of overall plastic strain). Thus, the state with higher $\\sigma_m$ carries a greater and more immediate risk of void coalescence.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. For the same $\\sigma_{eq}$, the state with larger $\\sigma_m$ produces a larger plastic volumetric strain rate in the porous solid, leading to a larger instantaneous void growth rate and an earlier attainment of the critical porosity for coalescence.**\nOur derivation shows that $\\dot{\\epsilon}_{p,kk} \\propto \\sinh(C \\cdot \\sigma_m)$ with $C>0$, and $\\dot{f} \\propto \\dot{\\epsilon}_{p,kk}$. Since $\\sinh(x)$ is a monotonically increasing function for $x \\ge 0$, a larger mean stress $\\sigma_m$ directly leads to a larger plastic volumetric strain rate and a larger void growth rate, assuming plastic deformation continues. This accelerates the approach to the critical porosity for coalescence. This statement is perfectly aligned with the derived behavior of the GTN model.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. At fixed $\\sigma_{eq}$, void growth is controlled only by the deviatoric response; therefore, both states have the same void growth rate and coalescence risk.**\nThe deviatoric response is associated with $\\sigma_{eq}$, while the volumetric response is driven by $\\sigma_m$. Our derivation explicitly shows that the void growth rate $\\dot{f}$ is a strong function of the mean stress $\\sigma_m$ through the term $\\sinh(\\frac{q_2 \\sigma_m}{\\sigma_y})$. Therefore, void growth is not controlled only by the deviatoric response. This statement misrepresents the fundamental mechanics of porous plasticity.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. A larger $\\sigma_m$ reduces the void growth rate at fixed $\\sigma_{eq}$ because the plastic multiplier decreases, delaying coalescence relative to the lower $\\sigma_m$ case.**\nThis statement claims an inverse relationship between $\\sigma_m$ and the void growth rate. Our derivation shows the opposite: $\\dot{f}$ increases with $\\sigma_m$. While the interplay between loading rates and the plastic multiplier can be complex, the direct and dominant effect of $\\sigma_m$ on void growth is captured by the $\\sinh$ term in the flow rule, which causes an increase, not a reduction, in $\\dot{f}$. The primary claim is fundamentally flawed.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. Void growth is non-monotonic in $\\sigma_m$ at fixed $\\sigma_{eq}$ in the GTN model; for small $f$, pure shear produces faster growth than uniaxial tension.**\nOur derivation demonstrates that $\\dot{f}$ is proportional to $\\sinh(\\frac{q_2 \\sigma_m}{\\sigma_y})$. This is a monotonically increasing function of $\\sigma_m$ for $\\sigma_m \\ge 0$. The relationship is not non-monotonic. The second part of the statement claims that pure shear ($\\sigma_m = 0$) results in faster growth than uniaxial tension ($\\sigma_m > 0$). Our analysis shows the opposite: $\\dot{f}=0$ for pure shear and $\\dot{f}>0$ for uniaxial tension.

At $f = f_{c}$, $f^{*}(f_{c}) = f_{c}$. This gives the point $(f_{c}, f_{c})$.\n2.  At $f = f_{f}$, $f^{*}(f_{f}) = 1/q_{1}$. This gives the point $(f_{f}, 1/q_{1})$.\n\nThe slope $m$ of the linear function is given by the change in $f^{*}$ divided by the change in $f$:\n$$m = \\frac{f^{*}(f_{f}) - f^{*}(f_{c})}{f_{f} - f_{c}} = \\frac{1/q_{1} - f_{c}}{f_{f} - f_{c}}$$\nUsing the point $(f_{c}, f_{c})$, the equation for $f^{*}$ for $f > f_{c}$ is:\n$$f^{*}(f) = f_{c} + m(f - f_{c}) = f_{c} + \\left(\\frac{1/q_{1} - f_{c}}{f_{f} - f_{c}}\\right)(f - f_{c})$$\nWe are given the parameter values $q_{1} = 1.5$, $f_{c} = 0.05$, and $f_{f} = 0.15$. First, we compute the slope $m$:\n$$m = \\frac{1/1.5 - 0.05}{0.15 - 0.05} = \\frac{2/3 - 0.05}{0.1} = \\frac{2/3 - 1/20}{1/10} = \\frac{(40 - 3)/60}{1/10} = \\frac{37/60}{1/10} = \\frac{37}{6}$$\nNow we can compute $f^{*}$ at $f = 0.08$. Since $0.08 > 0.05$, we are in the coalescence regime ($f>f_c$) and must use the derived linear relation:\n$$f^{*}(0.08) = f_{c} + m(0.08 - f_{c})$$\n$$f^{*}(0.08) = 0.05 + \\frac{37}{6}(0.08 - 0.05) = 0.05 + \\frac{37}{6}(0.03)$$\n$$f^{*}(0.08) = 0.05 + \\frac{37}{6}\\left(\\frac{3}{100}\\right) = 0.05 + \\frac{37}{200} = 0.05 + 0.185 = 0.235$$\nThe problem requires this value rounded to four significant figures, which gives $0.2350$.\n\nPart 2: Analysis of the normalized uniaxial yield stress\n\nThe Gurson–Tvergaard–Needleman yield function, $\\Phi$, is given by:\n$$\\Phi(\\boldsymbol{\\Sigma}, \\sigma_{y}, f^{*}) = \\left(\\frac{\\Sigma_{eq}}{\\sigma_{y}}\\right)^{2} + 2q_{1}f^{*}\\cosh\\left(\\frac{q_{2}\\Sigma_{m}}{2\\sigma_{y}}\\right) - (1 + q_{3}(f^{*})^{2}) = 0$$\nHere, $\\Sigma_{eq}$ is the macroscopic von Mises equivalent stress and $\\Sigma_{m}$ is the macroscopic mean stress. For a state of uniaxial tension with stress $\\sigma_{t}$, the macroscopic stress tensor components are zero except for one normal component equal to $\\sigma_{t}$. The invariants are $\\Sigma_{eq} = \\sigma_{t}$ and $\\Sigma_{m} = \\sigma_{t}/3$.\n\nSubstituting these into the yield function, along with the specified parameters $q_{2}=1$ and $q_{3}=q_{1}^{2}$, we obtain the yield condition for uniaxial tension:\n$$\\left(\\frac{\\sigma_{t}}{\\sigma_{y}}\\right)^{2} + 2q_{1}f^{*}\\cosh\\left(\\frac{\\sigma_{t}}{6\\sigma_{y}}\\right) - (1 + (q_{1}f^{*})^{2}) = 0$$\nLet $Y = \\sigma_{t}/\\sigma_{y}$ be the normalized uniaxial yield stress. The equation becomes a relation $G(Y, f^{*}) = 0$, where:\n$$G(Y, f^{*}) = Y^{2} + 2q_{1}f^{*}\\cosh\\left(\\frac{1}{6}Y\\right) - 1 - (q_{1}f^{*})^{2} = 0$$\nTo determine how $Y$ changes with $f^{*}$, we compute the derivative $dY/df^{*}$ using implicit differentiation:\n$$\\frac{dY}{df^{*}} = -\\frac{\\partial G/\\partial f^{*}}{\\partial G/\\partial Y}$$\nWe need to find the partial derivatives of $G(Y,f^{*})$:\n$$\\frac{\\partial G}{\\partial Y} = 2Y + 2q_{1}f^{*}\\sinh\\left(\\frac{1}{6}Y\\right)\\cdot\\frac{1}{6} = 2Y + \\frac{q_{1}f^{*}}{3}\\sinh\\left(\\frac{1}{6}Y\\right)$$\nFor a tensile test, the yield stress $\\sigma_t$ must be positive, so $Y>0$. The parameters $q_1$ and $f^*$ are also non-negative. Since $\\sinh(x) > 0$ for $x>0$, every term in the expression for $\\partial G/\\partial Y$ is non-negative, and at least one term ($2Y$) is strictly positive. Therefore, $\\partial G/\\partial Y > 0$.\n\nNext, we calculate the partial derivative with respect to $f^{*}$:\n$$\\frac{\\partial G}{\\partial f^{*}} = 2q_{1}\\cosh\\left(\\frac{1}{6}Y\\right) - 2q_{1}^{2}f^{*}$$\nTo determine the sign of this expression, we can use the yield condition $G(Y, f^{*})=0$ itself. From the yield condition, we can express $\\cosh\\left(\\frac{1}{6}Y\\right)$:\n$$2q_{1}f^{*}\\cosh\\left(\\frac{1}{6}Y\\right) = 1 + (q_{1}f^{*})^{2} - Y^{2}$$\n$$\\cosh\\left(\\frac{1}{6}Y\\right) = \\frac{1 + (q_{1}f^{*})^{2} - Y^{2}}{2q_{1}f^{*}}$$\nSubstituting this into the expression for $\\partial G/\\partial f^{*}$:\n$$\\frac{\\partial G}{\\partial f^{*}} = 2q_{1}\\left(\\frac{1 + (q_{1}f^{*})^{2} - Y^{2}}{2q_{1}f^{*}} - q_{1}f^{*}\\right) = \\frac{1 + (q_{1}f^{*})^{2} - Y^{2} - 2(q_{1}f^{*})^{2}}{f^{*}} = \\frac{1 - (q_{1}f^{*})^{2} - Y^{2}}{f^{*}}$$\nPhysically, for any fixed macroscopic stress state (i.e., fixed $Y=\\sigma_t/\\sigma_y < 1$), an increase in the damage parameter $f^{*}$ must drive the material closer to the yield surface. This means that the value of the yield function $\\Phi$ (or $G$) must increase with $f^{*}$. Thus, we must have $\\partial G/\\partial f^{*} > 0$.\nSince $f^{*} > 0$, this requires the numerator $1 - (q_{1}f^{*})^{2} - Y^{2} > 0$.\n\nWith both partial derivatives being positive:\n- $\\partial G/\\partial Y > 0$\n- $\\partial G/\\partial f^{*} > 0$\n\nThe derivative of $Y$ with respect to $f^{*}$ is:\n$$\\frac{dY}{df^{*}} = -\\frac{\\partial G/\\partial f^{*}}{\\partial G/\\partial Y} = - \\frac{\\text{positive number}}{\\text{positive number}} < 0$$\nA negative derivative indicates that an increase in the effective porosity $f^{*}$ causes a decrease in the normalized uniaxial yield stress $Y = \\sigma_{t}/\\sigma_{y}$.\nIn the problem, $f^{*}$ increases from $f^{*}(f_{c}) = f_{c} = 0.05$ to the calculated value $f^{*}(0.08) = 0.2350$. Our analysis shows that over this interval, and indeed for any increase in $f^{*}$, the normalized yield stress $\\sigma_{t}/\\sigma_{y}$ must decrease. This is physically intuitive: as the material becomes more porous, it weakens, and its ability to withstand macroscopic stress is diminished.\nTherefore, the normalized uniaxial yield stress $\\sigma_{t}/\\sigma_{y}$ decreases as $f^{*}$ increases from $f_{c}$ to the value at $f=0.08$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.2350}$$", "id": "2879360"}]}
