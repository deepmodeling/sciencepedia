The problem states that a single-parameter calibration constant, $C$, relates $\\delta_t$ to an energy release measure normalized by the flow stress. This relationship is commonly expressed in elastic-plastic fracture mechanics as:\n$$\n\\delta_t = C \\frac{J}{\\sigma_{\\text{flow}}}\n$$\nwhere $J$ is the $J$-integral, which serves as the energy release measure, and $\\sigma_{\\text{flow}}$ is the representative flow stress.\n\nThe problem specifies conditions of small-scale yielding. Under such conditions, the energy release rate in the nonlinear elastic-plastic material, characterized by the $J$-integral, is equivalent to the elastic energy release rate, $G$, derived from linear elastic fracture mechanics (LEFM). Thus, we can write:\n$$\nJ = G\n$$\n\nFor a crack subjected to Mode I loading, the elastic energy release rate $G$ is related to the Mode I stress intensity factor, $K_I$.

High constraint, typical for deeply-cracked bend or compact tension specimens under plane strain conditions, suppresses plastic deformation. Conversely, low constraint, found in thin sheets or center-cracked tension panels where plane stress conditions dominate near free surfaces, allows for more significant plastic flow.\n\nIn the context of this problem, the assumption of high constraint is critical because it dictates the use of the plane strain formula for the energy release rate, $G = \\frac{K_I^2 (1 - \\nu^2)}{E}$. If the constraint were low (plane stress), the appropriate formula would be $G = \\frac{K_I^2}{E}$, which would yield a higher value for $G$ (by a factor of $1/(1-\\nu^2) \\approx 1.099$ for $\\nu=0.3$) and consequently a higher estimate for $\\delta_t$. Therefore, the level of constraint directly influences the quantitative relationship between the far-field loading parameter ($K_I$) and the crack-tip parameter ($\\delta_t$).\n\nThe resistance curve, or R-curve, is a plot of a measure of fracture resistance (such as $J$ or $\\delta_t$) as a function of stable crack extension, $\\Delta a$. The material's resistance to crack growth is highly dependent on constraint. Under high-constraint conditions, the elevated stress triaxiality limits the size of the plastic zone and promotes fracture mechanisms that require less energy, such as cleavage. This results in a lower measured fracture toughness. Under low-constraint conditions, the material can undergo more extensive plastic deformation, which absorbs a significant amount of energy and elevates the resistance to crack propagation. Consequently, an R-curve determined under high constraint will lie significantly below an R-curve for the same material determined under low constraint. A high-constraint R-curve displays a lower initiation toughness and often a shallower slope, signifying that the material offers less resistance to continued crack growth.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{19.5}$$", "id": "2874468"}, {"introduction": "Building on the theoretical connection between the $J$-integral and crack tip opening displacement, this exercise moves into the realm of experimental data analysis.

It is scientifically grounded in the principles of elastic-plastic fracture mechanics, is internally consistent, and provides all necessary information for a unique and meaningful solution. We may therefore proceed with the derivation and calculation.\n\nThe central task is to assess the validity of a provisional fracture toughness measurement, $J_Q$, as the plane-strain initiation fracture toughness, $J_{Ic}$. A measurement of $J_{Ic}$ is considered valid only if it represents a material property that is independent of the test specimen's geometry. This independence is achieved under specific conditions of high crack-tip constraint and contained plasticity.\n\nFrom first principles, for the $J$-integral to be the unique parameter governing the crack-tip stress and strain fields (a condition known as $J$-dominance), the plastic deformation at the crack tip must be constrained. This requires two main conditions:\n$1$. The state of stress must approximate plane strain. This is achieved when the specimen thickness, $B$, is substantially larger than the plastic zone size. A large thickness suppresses through-thickness strain, leading to the high triaxiality characteristic of plane-strain conditions and a lower-bound toughness value.\n$2$. The plastic zone at the crack tip must be small compared to the characteristic in-plane dimensions of the specimen, such as the uncracked ligament, $b$. This ensures that the plastic zone is embedded within a predominantly elastic field, a condition known as small-scale yielding (SSY), which is a prerequisite for the applicability of the $J$-integral as a single crack-tip characterization parameter.\n\nBoth conditions can be expressed as a requirement that the key specimen dimensions, $B$ and $b$, must be much larger than a characteristic length scale of the plastic zone, $r_p$.\n$B, b \\gg r_p$\nThe next step is to define this characteristic length scale. In elastic-plastic fracture mechanics, the region of intense plastic deformation is governed by the $J$-integral and the material's flow properties. A representative flow stress, $\\sigma_{\\text{flow}}$, is used to characterize the material's resistance to plastic flow in the presence of work hardening. The problem defines this as the average of the yield and ultimate tensile strengths:\n$$ \\sigma_{\\text{flow}} = \\frac{\\sigma_{0.2} + \\sigma_{u}}{2} $$\nFrom dimensional analysis, the $J$-integral has units of energy per unit area ($[\\text{Energy}]/[\\text{Area}] = [F \\cdot L]/[L^2] = [F \\cdot L^{-1}]$), while stress has units of force per unit area ($[F \\cdot L^{-2}]$). The ratio $J/\\sigma_{\\text{flow}}$ must therefore have units of length ($[L]$):\n$$ \\left[\\frac{J}{\\sigma_{\\text{flow}}}\\right] = \\frac{[F \\cdot L^{-1}]}{[F \\cdot L^{-2}]} = [L] $$\nThis quantity, $J/\\sigma_{\\text{flow}}$, represents a fundamental length scale of the plastic deformation at the crack tip. It is directly related to the crack tip opening displacement ($\\delta_t \\approx J/\\sigma_{\\text{flow}}$) and is proportional to the plastic zone size, $r_p$.\n\nTo quantify the condition \"$B, b \\gg r_p$\", we must establish a multiplier. \"Well-established, conservative practice,\" derived from extensive experimental data and finite element simulations and codified in fracture testing standards such as ASTM E1820, dictates that the dimensions should be larger than this characteristic length by a significant factor to ensure the validity conditions are met. This leads to the criterion:\n$$ B, b \\ge N \\frac{J_Q}{\\sigma_{\\text{flow}}} $$\nwhere $J_Q$ is the candidate value for the initiation toughness.
