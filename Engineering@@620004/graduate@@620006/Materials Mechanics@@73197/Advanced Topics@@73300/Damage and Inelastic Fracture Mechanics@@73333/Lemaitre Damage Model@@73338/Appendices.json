The final reported answer must be the requested strain expression only.", "solution": "The problem as stated is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and contains sufficient information for a unique solution under a reasonable interpretation of its constraints. We shall proceed with the derivation.\n\nThe starting point is the Helmholtz free energy per unit reference volume, $\\psi$, for an isotropic elastic solid with damage, given as:\n$$\n\\psi(\\varepsilon^{e},D) = \\frac{1}{2} (1 - D) \\varepsilon^{e} : \\mathbb{C} : \\varepsilon^{e}\n$$\nwhere $\\varepsilon^{e}$ is the elastic strain tensor, $D$ is the scalar damage variable ($D=0$ for an undamaged state, $D \\to 1$ for complete failure), and $\\mathbb{C}$ is the fourth-order elasticity tensor.\n\nFor the specified case of a one-dimensional uniaxial tension test, the tensor quantities reduce to their scalar axial components. Let $\\varepsilon^{e}$ be the axial elastic strain. The elasticity tensor $\\mathbb{C}$ reduces to the Young's modulus, $E$. The expression for the free energy simplifies to:\n$$\n\\psi(\\varepsilon^{e},D) = \\frac{1}{2} (1 - D) E (\\varepsilon^{e})^{2}\n$$\n\nThe thermodynamic force conjugate to the damage variable is the damage energy release rate, $Y$, which is defined as the negative partial derivative of the Helmholtz free energy with respect to $D$, holding the elastic strain $\\varepsilon^{e}$ constant:\n$$\nY = -\\frac{\\partial \\psi}{\\partial D}\n$$\nSubstituting the one-dimensional expression for $\\psi$, we calculate this derivative:\n$$\nY = -\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial D} \\left( \\frac{1}{2} (1 - D) E (\\varepsilon^{e})^{2} \\right) = - \\left( - \\frac{1}{2} E (\\varepsilon^{e})^{2} \\right) = \\frac{1}{2} E (\\varepsilon^{e})^{2}\n$$\nThis result demonstrates that the damage energy release rate is precisely the elastic strain energy density stored in the undamaged material.\n\nThe problem states that damage initiation occurs when $Y$ reaches a critical material-specific threshold, $Y_{0}$, which is strictly positive. At the moment of initiation, the material is, by definition, still in its undamaged state, so $D=0$. The initiation criterion is therefore:\n$$\nY(\\varepsilon^{e}, D=0) = Y_{0}\n$$\nSubstituting our derived expression for $Y$:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{2} E (\\varepsilon^{e})^{2} = Y_{0}\n$$\nWe can solve this equation for the elastic strain at the point of damage initiation, which we denote $\\varepsilon^{e}_{\\text{initiation}}$:\n$$\n(\\varepsilon^{e}_{\\text{initiation}})^{2} = \\frac{2 Y_{0}}{E}\n$$\nGiven monotonic tensile loading, the strain is non-negative. We take the positive square root:\n$$\n\\varepsilon^{e}_{\\text{initiation}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{2 Y_{0}}{E}}\n$$\nThis expression gives the critical value of *elastic* strain at which damage begins.\n\nThe problem requires an expression for the *total* strain, $\\varepsilon$, at initiation. The total strain is given by the additive decomposition $\\varepsilon = \\varepsilon^{e} + \\varepsilon^{p}$, where $\\varepsilon^{p}$ is the plastic strain. The problem explicitly asks for the final expression to be in terms of only $Y_{0}$ and $E$. This is a strong constraint that dictates the physical regime we must consider. An expression for total strain that includes a non-zero plastic strain component, $\\varepsilon^{p}$, would necessarily depend on the material's plastic properties (e.g., yield stress, hardening parameters), which are not provided. The only way to satisfy the problem's constraint is to assume a scenario where plastic strain has not yet accumulated at the moment of damage initiation. This corresponds to a brittle or quasi-brittle material response where damage initiation precedes plastic yielding. In this case, $\\varepsilon^{p} = 0$.\n\nUnder this necessary assumption ($\\varepsilon^{p}=0$), the total strain is equal to the elastic strain:\n$$\n\\varepsilon_{\\text{initiation}} = \\varepsilon^{e}_{\\text{initiation}} + 0 = \\sqrt{\\frac{2 Y_{0}}{E}}\n$$\nThis is the sought-after expression for the total strain at damage initiation. The quantity $\\frac{Y_{0}}{E}$ is dimensionless, as $Y_{0}$ (energy/volume) and $E$ (stress) both have units of pressure (Pascals), so the strain $\\varepsilon$ is correctly reported as a dimensionless quantity.\n\nFinally, we address the question of whether pre-yield plasticity alters this strain level. Based on the thermodynamic structure of the model, the damage initiation criterion $Y=Y_{0}$ depends exclusively on the elastic strain $\\varepsilon^{e}$. The critical value $\\varepsilon^{e}_{\\text{initiation}} = \\sqrt{2 Y_{0}/E}$ is therefore fixed and independent of plastic deformation. However, if the material is ductile and yields before damage initiation, then at the point where $\\varepsilon^{e}$ reaches $\\varepsilon^{e}_{\\text{initiation}}$, a non-zero plastic strain $\\varepsilon^{p}>0$ will have accumulated. The total strain at initiation would then be $\\varepsilon_{\\text{initiation}} = \\varepsilon^{e}_{\\text{initiation}} + \\varepsilon^{p} = \\sqrt{2 Y_{0}/E} + \\varepsilon^{p}$. Thus, pre-yield plasticity increases the *total strain* required to initiate damage, even though the *elastic strain* at which initiation occurs remains unchanged.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\sqrt{\\frac{2 Y_{0}}{E}}}\n$$", "id": "2897244"}, {"introduction": "When a material undergoes plastic deformation and damage, its mechanical response changes.

The setup is a standard exercise in computational or theoretical plasticity and damage.\n\nStep 3: Verdict and Action.\nThe problem is deemed valid. A complete solution will now be provided.\n\nThe foundation of the analysis rests on the constitutive relations provided. The Cauchy stress $\\sigma$ is related to the total strain $\\varepsilon$ and the internal variables $D$ and $\\varepsilon^p$. During unloading and reloading, the tangent stiffness $K_u$ is the rate of change of stress with respect to total strain. Given the assumption that plastic strain $\\varepsilon^p$ and damage $D$ are constant during this phase, we have $d\\varepsilon = d\\varepsilon^e$.\n\nThe stress-strain relation for the damaged material is derived from the effective stress concept:\n$$ \\sigma = (1-D) \\tilde{\\sigma} = (1-D) E_0 \\varepsilon^e $$\nThe tangent stiffness during unloading, $K_u$, is therefore:\n$$ K_u = \\frac{d\\sigma}{d\\varepsilon} = \\frac{d\\sigma}{d\\varepsilon^e} = (1-D)E_0 $$\nThis equation allows for the determination of the damage variable $D$ from the given moduli $E_0$ and $K_u$:\n$$ D = 1 - \\frac{K_u}{E_0} $$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$ D = 1 - \\frac{150 \\,\\mathrm{GPa}}{200 \\,\\mathrm{GPa}} = 1 - 0.75 = 0.25 $$\nThe damage accumulated during the initial loading phase is $D=0.25$.\n\nNext, we analyze the strain components. The total strain is $\\varepsilon = \\varepsilon^e + \\varepsilon^p$. The residual strain $\\varepsilon_r$ is the total strain remaining after the specimen is fully unloaded to $\\sigma=0$. At $\\sigma=0$, the elastic strain $\\varepsilon^e$ is also zero, since $\\varepsilon^e = \\sigma / ((1-D)E_0) = 0$. Therefore, the residual strain must be equal to the permanent plastic strain:\n$$ \\varepsilon_r = \\varepsilon^p = 1.0 \\times 10^{-3} $$\nThis is the plastic strain that was \"frozen\" at the point of unloading.\n\nWe now compute the two strains required for $\\Delta\\varepsilon_{\\text{tot}}$ at the target stress $\\sigma^{\\star} = 300 \\,\\mathrm{MPa} = 0.3 \\,\\mathrm{GPa}$.\n\nFirst, the strain on the virgin linear-elastic path, $\\varepsilon_{\\text{virgin}}$. This is the response of the undamaged material, governed by Hooke's law with modulus $E_0$:\n$$ \\varepsilon_{\\text{virgin}}(\\sigma^{\\star}) = \\frac{\\sigma^{\\star}}{E_0} $$\n\nSecond, the strain on the reloading path, $\\varepsilon_{\\text{reload}}$. The reloading path follows the unloading line, which is characterized by the constant damaged stiffness $K_u = (1-D)E_0$ and the constant plastic strain $\\varepsilon^p = \\varepsilon_r$. The total strain is the sum of the elastic and plastic components:\n$$ \\varepsilon_{\\text{reload}}(\\sigma^{\\star}) = \\varepsilon^e(\\sigma^{\\star}) + \\varepsilon^p $$\nThe elastic strain on the reloading path is governed by the damaged modulus $K_u$:\n$$ \\varepsilon^e(\\sigma^{\\star}) = \\frac{\\sigma^{\\star}}{(1-D)E_0} = \\frac{\\sigma^{\\star}}{K_u} $$\nThus, the total strain on the reloading path is:\n$$ \\varepsilon_{\\text{reload}}(\\sigma^{\\star}) = \\frac{\\sigma^{\\star}}{K_u} + \\varepsilon_r $$\n\nThe total separation in strain, $\\Delta\\varepsilon_{\\text{tot}}$, is defined as their difference:\n$$ \\Delta\\varepsilon_{\\text{tot}} = \\varepsilon_{\\text{reload}}(\\sigma^{\\star}) - \\varepsilon_{\\text{virgin}}(\\sigma^{\\star}) = \\left(\\frac{\\sigma^{\\star}}{K_u} + \\varepsilon_r\\right) - \\frac{\\sigma^{\\star}}{E_0} $$\nRearranging this expression allows for the required additive decomposition:\n$$ \\Delta\\varepsilon_{\\text{tot}} = \\varepsilon_r + \\left(\\frac{\\sigma^{\\star}}{K_u} - \\frac{\\sigma^{\\star}}{E_0}\\right) $$\nThe first term, $\\varepsilon_r$, is the permanent offset in strain due to plastic deformation. This represents the contribution of plasticity to the total strain separation, which we denote $\\Delta\\varepsilon_p$:\n$$ \\Delta\\varepsilon_p = \\varepsilon_r $$\nThe second term represents the additional elastic strain that arises at stress $\\sigma^{\\star}$ because the material's stiffness has been reduced from $E_0$ to $K_u$ by damage. This is the contribution of damage, denoted $\\Delta\\varepsilon_D$:\n$$ \\Delta\\varepsilon_D = \\frac{\\sigma^{\\star}}{K_u} - \\frac{\\sigma^{\\star}}{E_0} = \\sigma^{\\star}\\left(\\frac{1}{K_u} - \\frac{1}{E_0}\\right) $$\nThus, we have the decomposition $\\Delta\\varepsilon_{\\text{tot}} = \\Delta\\varepsilon_p + \\Delta\\varepsilon_D$.\n\nThe problem asks for the fraction of $\\Delta\\varepsilon_{\\text{tot}}$ attributable to plasticity. This fraction, $f_p$, is given by:\n$$ f_p = \\frac{\\Delta\\varepsilon_p}{\\Delta\\varepsilon_{\\text{tot}}} = \\frac{\\Delta\\varepsilon_p}{\\Delta\\varepsilon_p + \\Delta\\varepsilon_D} $$\nWe now substitute the expressions and numerical values.\n$$ \\Delta\\varepsilon_p = \\varepsilon_r = 1.0 \\times 10^{-3} $$\n$$ \\Delta\\varepsilon_D = (0.3 \\,\\mathrm{GPa}) \\left(\\frac{1}{150 \\,\\mathrm{GPa}} - \\frac{1}{200 \\,\\mathrm{GPa}}\\right) = 0.3 \\left(\\frac{4 - 3}{600}\\right) = \\frac{0.3}{600} = \\frac{1}{2000} = 0.5 \\times 10^{-3} $$\nThe total strain separation is:\n$$ \\Delta\\varepsilon_{\\text{tot}} = (1.0 \\times 10^{-3}) + (0.5 \\times 10^{-3}) = 1.5 \\times 10^{-3} $$\nThe fraction attributable to plasticity is:\n$$ f_p = \\frac{1.0 \\times 10^{-3}}{1.5 \\times 10^{-3}} = \\frac{1.0}{1.5} = \\frac{2}{3} $$\nAs a decimal, this is $0.6666...$.
