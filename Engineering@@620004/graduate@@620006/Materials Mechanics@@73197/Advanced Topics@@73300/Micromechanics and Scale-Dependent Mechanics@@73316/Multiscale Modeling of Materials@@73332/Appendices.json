I will now proceed with the solution.\n\nThe objective is to estimate the infinite-size effective modulus $E_\\infty$ of a one-dimensional, two-phase random composite and to provide a confidence interval for this estimate. This is achieved through a finite-size scaling analysis based on Monte Carlo simulations of the apparent modulus $E_{\\mathrm{app}}(N)$ for systems of finite size $N$.\n\nThe theoretical foundation is linear elasticity for a one-dimensional bar in series, where stress $\\sigma$ is uniform and strain $\\varepsilon(x)$ varies with the local Young's modulus $E(x)$ according to $\\varepsilon(x) = \\sigma/E(x)$. The apparent modulus of a sample with $N$ discrete cells is the harmonic mean of the cell moduli $E_i$:\n$$\nE_{\\mathrm{app}}(N) = \\left( \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{i=1}^N \\frac{1}{E_i} \\right)^{-1}\n$$\nThe cell modulus $E_i$ is a random variable, taking the value $E_1$ with probability $p$ and $E_2$ with probability $1-p$.\nBy the law of large numbers, as $N \\to \\infty$, the sample mean of the compliance $1/E_i$ converges to its expected value:\n$$\n\\lim_{N \\to \\infty} \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{i=1}^N \\frac{1}{E_i} = \\mathbb{E}\\left[\\frac{1}{E}\\right] = \\frac{p}{E_1} + \\frac{1-p}{E_2}\n$$\nThus, the infinite-size effective modulus $E_\\infty$ is:\n$$\nE_\\infty = \\left( \\mathbb{E}\\left[\\frac{1}{E}\\right] \\right)^{-1} = \\left( \\frac{p}{E_1} + \\frac{1-p}{E_2} \\right)^{-1}\n$$\nFor a finite size $N$, the expected apparent modulus can be approximated by a finite-size scaling law:\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}[E_{\\mathrm{app}}(N)] \\approx E_\\infty + \\frac{A}{N}\n$$\nwhere $A$ is a constant. We will fit the model $y(N) = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x$ to simulation data, where $y(N)$ is the estimated mean of $E_{app}(N)$, $x = 1/N$, $\\beta_0$ is an estimator for $E_\\infty$, and $\\beta_1$ is an estimator for $A$.\n\nThe solution procedure is as follows:\n\n1.  **Monte Carlo Simulation**: For each test case, and for each size $N_k$ in the provided list, we generate $R$ independent realizations of the composite. For each realization $j \\in \\{1, \\dots, R\\}$:\n    a. We generate a set of $N_k$ cell moduli, $\\{E_i\\}_{i=1}^{N_k}$, where each $E_i$ is drawn independently from the distribution P$(E=E_1) = p$ and P$(E=E_2) = 1-p$.\n    b. We compute the apparent modulus for this realization, $E_{\\mathrm{app}}^{(j)}(N_k)$, using the harmonic mean formula.\n    This process yields a sample of $R$ values of the apparent modulus for each size $N_k$.\n\n2.  **Statistical Estimation**: From the $R$ Monte Carlo samples for a given size $N_k$, we compute the sample mean $\\hat{y}_k$ and the standard error of the mean $\\widehat{\\mathrm{SE}}_k$:\n    $$\n    \\hat{y}_k = \\frac{1}{R} \\sum_{j=1}^R E_{\\mathrm{app}}^{(j)}(N_k)\n    $$\n    $$\n    s_k^2 = \\frac{1}{R-1} \\sum_{j=1}^R \\left( E_{\\mathrm{app}}^{(j)}(N_k) - \\hat{y}_k \\right)^2\n    $$\n    $$\n    \\widehat{\\mathrm{SE}}_k = \\frac{s_k}{\\sqrt{R}}\n    $$\n    The data points for our regression analysis are $(x_k, \\hat{y}_k)$, where $x_k = 1/N_k$.\n\n3.  **Weighted Least Squares (WLS) Regression**: We fit the linear model $\\hat{y}_k = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x_k + \\epsilon_k$ to the computed data points. Since the uncertainty of each point $\\hat{y}_k$ is given by its standard error $\\widehat{\\mathrm{SE}}_k$, we use WLS with weights $w_k = 1/\\widehat{\\mathrm{SE}}_k^2$. If $\\widehat{\\mathrm{SE}}_k = 0$, we enforce a small positive floor for its squared value to ensure weights remain finite. The vector of estimated parameters $\\hat{\\beta} = [\\hat{\\beta}_0, \\hat{\\beta}_1]^T$ is given by:\n    $$\n    \\hat{\\beta} = (X^T W X)^{-1} X^T W Y\n    $$\n    where $Y$ is the column vector of mean values $[\\hat{y}_k]$, $X$ is the design matrix with rows $[1, x_k]$, and $W$ is the diagonal matrix of weights $[w_k]$. The estimate for the effective modulus is $\\hat{E}_\\infty = \\hat{\\beta}_0$.\n\n4.  **Confidence Interval Calculation**: A $95\\%$ confidence interval for the intercept $\\hat{\\beta}_0$ is constructed using the Student's $t$-distribution. The estimated covariance matrix of the parameters is:\n    $$\n    \\widehat{\\mathrm{Cov}}(\\hat{\\beta}) = \\hat{\\sigma}^2 (X^T W X)^{-1}\n    $$\n    where $\\hat{\\sigma}^2$ is the unbiased estimator of the residual variance, also known as the reduced chi-squared statistic:\n    $$\n    \\hat{\\sigma}^2 = \\frac{1}{n_p - 2} \\sum_{k=1}^{n_p} w_k (\\hat{y}_k - (\\hat{\\beta}_0 + \\hat{\\beta}_1 x_k))^2\n    $$\n    Here, $n_p$ is the number of data points (i.e., the number of distinct sizes $N_k$), and the degrees of freedom are $\\nu = n_p - 2$. The standard error of the intercept is the square root of the first diagonal element of the covariance matrix:\n    $$\n    \\mathrm{se}(\\hat{\\beta}_0) = \\sqrt{\\widehat{\\mathrm{Cov}}(\\hat{\\beta})_{00}}\n    $$\n    The two-sided $95\\%$ confidence interval for $\\beta_0$ is then:\n    $$\n    CI = \\left[ \\hat{\\beta}_0 - t_{\\nu, 0.975} \\cdot \\mathrm{se}(\\hat{\\beta}_0), \\quad \\hat{\\beta}_0 + t_{\\nu, 0.975} \\cdot \\mathrm{se}(\\hat{\\beta}_0) \\right]\n    $$\n    where $t_{\\nu, 0.975}$ is the upper critical value of the Student's $t$-distribution for a probability of $0.975$ with $\\nu$ degrees of freedom.\n\nThis complete procedure is implemented for each test case to produce the required estimates and confidence bounds. Special attention is given to the homogeneous case (Case C), where the variance of $E_{\\mathrm{app}}(N)$ is theoretically zero. The numerical implementation handles this by ensuring weights remain finite, leading to a zero-width confidence interval centered on the exact modulus, which serves as a correct and necessary sanity check.", "answer": "```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy.stats import t\n\ndef process_case(e1, e2, p, N_list, R, seed):\n    \"\"\"\n    Processes a single test case for finite-size scaling analysis.\n\n    Args:\n        e1 (float): Modulus of phase 1 (GPa).\n        e2 (float): Modulus of phase 2 (GPa).\n        p (float): Probability (volume fraction) of phase 1.\n        N_list (list): List of system sizes (number of cells).\n        R (int): Number of Monte Carlo realizations for each size.\n        seed (int): Seed for the random number generator.\n\n    Returns:\n        list: A list containing the estimated effective modulus, the lower bound of\n              the 95% confidence interval, and the upper bound.\n    \"\"\"\n    rng = np.random.default_rng(seed)\n    \n    y_means = []\n    y_ses = []\n\n    for N in N_list:\n        # Generate R realizations of a system with N cells\n        # Shape of choices is (R, N)\n        choices = rng.choice([e1, e2], size=(R, N), p=[p, 1 -
