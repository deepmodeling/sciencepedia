As $u_{3}$ is a function of $x_{1}$ and $x_{2}$ only, its derivative with respect to $x_{3}$ is zero:\n$$\n\\beta^{e}_{31} = \\partial_{1}u_{3} = \\frac{b}{2\\pi}\\,\\partial_{1}\\theta\n$$\n$$\n\\beta^{e}_{32} = \\partial_{2}u_{3} = \\frac{b}{2\\pi}\\,\\partial_{2}\\theta\n$$\n$$\n\\beta^{e}_{33} = \\partial_{3}u_{3} = 0\n$$\n\nNow we compute the required components of the dislocation density tensor $\\alpha_{i3}$.

These components represent densities of edge dislocations with line directions along $x_{3}$ and Burgers vectors in the $x_{1}$-$x_{2}$ plane, which are absent in a pure screw dislocation of this orientation.\n\nFor $i=3$:\nWe must compute $\\alpha_{33}$, which represents the density of screw dislocations with lines parallel to the $x_{3}$ axis.\n$$\n\\alpha_{33} = \\partial_{1}\\beta^{e}_{32} - \\partial_{2}\\beta^{e}_{31}\n$$\nSubstituting the expressions for $\\beta^{e}_{31}$ and $\\beta^{e}_{32}$:\n$$\n\\alpha_{33} = \\partial_{1}\\left(\\frac{b}{2\\pi}\\,\\partial_{2}\\theta\\right) - \\partial_{2}\\left(\\frac{b}{2\\pi}\\,\\partial_{1}\\theta\\right) = \\frac{b}{2\\pi} \\left( \\partial_{1}\\partial_{2}\\theta - \\partial_{2}\\partial_{1}\\theta \\right)\n$$\nFor any smooth, single-valued function, the mixed partial derivatives would commute, yielding zero. However, the function $u_{3}$ is multi-valued at the origin, manifested by the fact that the angle $\\theta(x_{1}, x_{2})$ increases by $2\\pi$ upon completion of any circuit around the origin. Consequently, its derivatives must be treated as distributions.\n\nThe fundamental connection between the dislocation density and the displacement field is established through the Burgers circuit. The Burgers vector $\\mathbf{b}$ is the closure failure of a lattice circuit, which in the continuum limit corresponds to the line integral of the elastic distortion around a closed loop $C$:\n$$\nb_{i} = \\oint_{C} d u_{i} = \\oint_{C} (\\partial_{l}u_{i}) \\,dx_{l} = \\oint_{C} \\beta^{e}_{il}\\,dx_{l}\n$$\nFor the given screw dislocation, the Burgers vector is $\\mathbf{b} = (0,0,b)$. Thus, $b_3 = b$. Let us take a loop $C$ in a plane of constant $x_{3}$ that encloses the origin (the dislocation line). For the third component of the Burgers vector, we have:\n$$\nb = b_{3} = \\oint_{C} \\beta^{e}_{3l}\\,dx_{l} = \\oint_{C} \\left( \\beta^{e}_{31}\\,dx_{1} + \\beta^{e}_{32}\\,dx_{2} \\right)\n$$\nThis result is consistent with the definition of $u_{3}$: the integral $\\oint_{C} du_{3}$ is the total change in $u_{3}$ around the loop, which is $\\frac{b}{2\\pi} \\times (2\\pi) = b$. If the loop $C$ does not enclose the origin, the integral is zero.\n\nWe can relate this line integral to a surface integral of the dislocation density using Stokes' theorem in the $x_{1}$-$x_{2}$ plane. Let $A$ be the area enclosed by the curve $C$.\n$$\n\\oint_{C} \\left( \\beta^{e}_{31}\\,dx_{1} + \\beta^{e}_{32}\\,dx_{2} \\right) = \\iint_{A} \\left( \\partial_{1}\\beta^{e}_{32} - \\partial_{2}\\beta^{e}_{31} \\right) \\,dx_{1}dx_{2}\n$$\nThe integrand is precisely $\\alpha_{33}(x_{1}, x_{2})$. Therefore, we have the property:\n$$\n\\iint_{A} \\alpha_{33}(x_{1}, x_{2}) \\,dx_{1}dx_{2} = \n\\begin{cases}\nb & \\text{if the origin } (0,0) \\in A \\\\\n0 & \\text{if the origin } (0,0) \\notin A\n\\end{cases}\n$$\nThis is the defining property of a two-dimensional Dirac delta distribution, $\\delta(x_{1}, x_{2}) \\equiv \\delta(x_{1})\\delta(x_{2})$, scaled by a constant factor $b$. The integral of $\\delta(x_{1}, x_{2})$ over any area containing the origin is $1$, and zero otherwise.\nFrom this, we conclude that the dislocation density component $\\alpha_{33}$ on any plane of constant $x_{3}$ is:\n$$\n\\alpha_{33}(x_{1}, x_{2}) = b\\,\\delta(x_{1})\\delta(x_{2})\n$$\nSince the dislocation line is infinite and straight along the $x_{3}$-axis, this distribution is independent of $x_{3}$. Therefore, the expression $\\alpha_{33} = b\\,\\delta(x_{1})\\delta(x_{2})$ represents the dislocation density distribution in $\\mathbb{R}^{3}$. It describes a line density of magnitude $b$ concentrated on the $x_{3}$-axis.\n\nIn summary, the components of $\\alpha_{i3}$ are:\n$\\alpha_{13} = 0$\n$\\alpha_{23} = 0$\n$\\alpha_{33} = b\\,\\delta(x_{1})\\delta(x_{2})$\n\nThe final answer should be presented as a row matrix.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 & b\\,\\delta(x_{1})\\delta(x_{2}) \\end{pmatrix}}\n$$", "id": "2889219"}, {"introduction": "Building on the concept of dislocation density, we now turn to the fundamental physical definition of a dislocation: the closure failure of a lattice circuit, known as the Burgers vector.

Since $\\beta^{p}_{31}=0$ and $\\beta^{p}_{32}=0$, we get $\\alpha_{33} = 0$.\n\nThe only non-zero components of the Nye tensor are $\\alpha_{13}$ and $\\alpha_{23}$.\n\nNow we apply these general results to the two specified slip fields.\n\nFor slip field A: $\\gamma^{1}_{A}(x,y) = a\\,x$, $\\gamma^{2}_{A}(x,y) = b\\,y$.\n$$\n\\alpha_{13,A} = -\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}(a\\,x) = -a\n$$\n$$\n\\alpha_{23,A} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}(b\\,y) = b\n$$\nSo, the Nye tensor for field A is $\\boldsymbol{\\alpha}_{A} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 & -a \\\\ 0 & 0 & b \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$.\n\nFor slip field B: $\\gamma^{1}_{B}(x,y) = a\\,x + c\\,y$, $\\gamma^{2}_{B}(x,y) = b\\,y - c\\,x$.\n$$\n\\alpha_{13,B} = -\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}(a\\,x + c\\,y) = -a\n$$\n$$\n\\alpha_{23,B} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}(b\\,y - c\\,x) = b\n$$\nThe Nye tensor for field B is $\\boldsymbol{\\alpha}_{B} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 & -a \\\\ 0 & 0 & b \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$.\n\nAs shown, $\\boldsymbol{\\alpha}_{A} = \\boldsymbol{\\alpha}_{B}$. The Nye tensors are identical for both slip fields, with the non-zero components being $\\alpha_{13}=-a$ and $\\alpha_{23}=b$.\n\n**Part 2: Computation of the Lattice Rotation Difference**\n\nWe are given the constraint $\\nabla \\mathbf{u} = \\mathbf{0}$, which implies $\\boldsymbol{\\beta}^{e} + \\boldsymbol{\\beta}^{p} = \\mathbf{0}$, or $\\boldsymbol{\\beta}^{e} = -\\boldsymbol{\\beta}^{p}$.\nThe elastic lattice rotation about the $z$-axis is defined as $\\omega^{e}_{z}(x,y) = \\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\beta^{e}_{yx} - \\beta^{e}_{xy}\\right)$.\nSubstituting the components of $\\boldsymbol{\\beta}^{e}$ with those of $\\boldsymbol{\\beta}^{p}$:\n$$\n\\omega^{e}_{z} = \\frac{1}{2}\\left(-\\beta^{p}_{yx} - (-\\beta^{p}_{xy})\\right) = \\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\beta^{p}_{xy} - \\beta^{p}_{yx}\\right)\n$$\nUsing our expressions $\\beta^{p}_{xy} = \\gamma^{1}$ and $\\beta^{p}_{yx} = \\gamma^{2}$, the rotation becomes:\n$$\n\\omega^{e}_{z}(x,y) = \\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\gamma^{1}(x,y) - \\gamma^{2}(x,y)\\right)\n$$\nNow, we compute this rotation for each slip field.\n\nFor slip field A:\n$$\n\\omega^{e}_{z,A}(x,y) = \\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\gamma^{1}_{A} - \\gamma^{2}_{A}\\right) = \\frac{1}{2}(a\\,x - b\\,y)\n$$\n\nFor slip field B:\n$$\n\\omega^{e}_{z,B}(x,y) = \\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\gamma^{1}_{B} - \\gamma^{2}_{B}\\right) = \\frac{1}{2}\\left((a\\,x + c\\,y) - (b\\,y - c\\,x)\\right)\n$$\n$$\n\\omega^{e}_{z,B}(x,y) = \\frac{1}{2}(a\\,x + c\\,y - b\\,y + c\\,x)\n$$\n\nFinally, we compute the difference $\\Delta \\omega^{e}_{z}(x,y) = \\omega^{e}_{z,B}(x,y) - \\omega^{e}_{z,A}(x,y)$:\n$$\n\\Delta\\omega^{e}_{z}(x,y) = \\frac{1}{2}(a\\,x + c\\,y - b\\,y + c\\,x) - \\frac{1}{2}(a\\,x - b\\,y)\n$$\n$$\n\\Delta\\omega^{e}_{z}(x,y) = \\frac{1}{2}(a\\,x + c\\,y - b\\,y + c\\,x - a\\,x + b\\,y)\n$$\nGrouping and canceling terms:\n$$\n\\Delta\\omega^{e}_{z}(x,y) = \\frac{1}{2}((a\\,x - a\\,x) + (-b\\,y + b\\,y) + c\\,y + c\\,x)\n$$\n$$\n\\Delta\\omega^{e}_{z}(x,y) = \\frac{1}{2}(c\\,y + c\\,x) = \\frac{c(x+y)}{2}\n$$\nThis expression represents the difference in elastic lattice rotation between the two plastic deformation fields.
