It is scientifically grounded in the principles of dislocation mechanics, well-posed, objective, and internally consistent. It represents a standard, canonical problem in materials science concerning the mechanism of a Frank–Read source. We proceed with the derivation.\n\nThe problem requires a derivation of the equilibrium shape of a pinned dislocation segment under a uniform resolved shear stress $\\tau$, and then to find the critical conditions for mechanical instability. We use the provided line tension approximation.\n\nFirst, we establish the local equilibrium condition. There are two forces acting on any infinitesimal segment of the dislocation line, of length $ds$.\n$1$. The forward force due to the applied shear stress $\\tau$. This is given by the Peach-Koehler equation. For the specified edge dislocation configuration, the force per unit length is in the glide plane, normal to the dislocation line, with magnitude $F_{PK} = \\tau b$. This force drives the dislocation to bow outwards.\n\n$2$. The restoring force due to the line tension, $T$. The line tension acts to minimize the length of the dislocation line, analogous to surface tension in a membrane. For a curved segment of length $ds$ with a local radius of curvature $R$, the line tension vectors at its endpoints produce a net force directed towards the center of curvature. The magnitude of this restoring force per unit length is given by $F_{T} = \\frac{T}{R}$.\n\nFor the dislocation segment to be in mechanical equilibrium, these two opposing forces must balance at every point along its length. Therefore, the local equilibrium condition is:\n$$F_{PK} = F_{T}$$\n$$\\tau b = \\frac{T}{R}$$\nThis is the fundamental relationship between the applied stress $\\tau$ and the local radius of curvature $R$ of the dislocation line.\n\nNext, we argue that the bowed shape must have constant curvature. The problem states that the applied resolved shear stress $\\tau$ is uniform. The Burgers vector magnitude $b$ is an intrinsic property of the crystal lattice and is constant. The line tension $T$ is assumed to be constant in this model. Rearranging the equilibrium equation to solve for the radius of curvature $R$:\n$$R = \\frac{T}{\\tau b}$$\nSince $T$, $\\tau$, and $b$ are all constant along the entire length of the pinned segment, the radius of curvature $R$ must also be constant. A curve in a plane with a constant radius of curvature is, by definition, an arc of a circle. Thus, under quasi-static equilibrium, the bowed dislocation segment assumes the shape of a circular arc.\n\nNow, we derive the expression for the bow-out angle $\\theta$. Let the two pinning points be separated by a distance $L$, which forms the chord of the circular arc. Let $R$ be the radius of this arc. We can construct a right-angled triangle using the center of the circle, one of the pinning points, and the midpoint of the chord. The hypotenuse of this triangle is the radius $R$, and one of the legs is half the chord length, $\\frac{L}{2}$. The bow-out angle $\\theta$ is defined as the angle between the tangent to the dislocation at a pin and the straight line connecting the pins (the chord). The radius to the pinning point is, by definition, perpendicular to the tangent at that point. Let the angle between the radius and the chord be $\\phi$. The relationship between these angles is $\\theta + \\phi = \\frac{\\pi}{2}$. In the right-angled triangle described, the cosine of the angle $\\phi$ is the ratio of the adjacent side ($\\frac{L}{2}$) to the hypotenuse ($R$). So, $\\cos(\\phi) = \\frac{L}{2R}$.\nUsing the trigonometric identity $\\cos(\\phi) = \\cos(\\frac{\\pi}{2} - \\theta) = \\sin(\\theta)$, we find the desired geometric relation:\n$$\\sin(\\theta) = \\frac{L}{2R}$$\n\nAs the stress $\\tau$ is increased, the radius of curvature $R = \\frac{T}{\\tau b}$ decreases, and the dislocation bows out more. The bow-out angle $\\theta$ increases according to $\\sin(\\theta) = \\frac{L\\tau b}{2T}$. The configuration becomes unstable when the radius of curvature reaches its minimum possible value for a static solution. This occurs when the bowed segment becomes a semicircle, at which point the chord length $L$ is equal to the diameter of the circle, $2R$.\nThe minimum radius is therefore $R_{\\min} = \\frac{L}{2}$. Any further decrease in $R$ is geometrically impossible for a single arc spanning the fixed points, so the dislocation loop becomes unstable and expands rapidly.\n\nWe can now find the maximum bow-out angle, $\\theta_{\\max}$, which occurs at this critical condition. Substituting $R = R_{\\min} = \\frac{L}{2}$ into our geometric relation:\n$$\\sin(\\theta_{\\max}) = \\frac{L}{2R_{\\min}} = \\frac{L}{2(\\frac{L}{2})} = 1$$\nThis gives a maximum angle of $\\theta_{\\max} = \\arcsin(1) = \\frac{\\pi}{2}$ radians. At this point, the tangents to the dislocation line at the pinning points are perpendicular to the line segment connecting them.\n\nFinally, we determine the critical shear stress, $\\tau_{c}$, required to reach this unstable semicircular configuration. This stress corresponds to the minimum radius of curvature, $R_{\\min} = \\frac{L}{2}$.

It is a well-formulated, scientifically sound question pertaining to the numerical implementation of a physical phenomenon. A solution will now be derived.\n\nThe core physical principle governing a Frank–Read source is the balance between the outward force due to an applied resolved shear stress, $\\tau_{\\mathrm{res}}$, and the inward-pulling force due to the line tension, $T$, of the dislocation. The force per unit length on the dislocation due to the shear stress is $f_{\\tau} = \\tau_{\\mathrm{res}} b$, where $b = \\lVert \\mathbf{b}\\rVert$ is the magnitude of the Burgers vector. In the line-tension approximation, the dislocation segment is treated as a flexible line with tension $T$. A segment bowed into a circular arc of radius of curvature $R$ experiences a restoring force per unit length of $f_{T} = T/R$.\n\nEquilibrium is achieved when these forces balance:\n$$ \\tau_{\\mathrm{res}} b = \\frac{T}{R} $$\nAs the stress increases, the dislocation bows out further, and the radius of curvature $R$ decreases. For a segment of initial length $L$ pinned at its ends, the minimum possible radius of curvature is $R_{\\mathrm{min}} = L/2$, corresponding to a semicircular configuration. At this point, the dislocation is critically unstable; any further infinitesimal bowing leads to spontaneous expansion. The stress required to reach this critical configuration is the critical resolved shear stress, $\\tau_{c}$. Substituting $R = R_{\\mathrm{min}} = L/2$ into the force balance equation gives:\n$$ \\tau_{c} b = \\frac{T}{L/2} = \\frac{2T}{L} $$\nTherefore, the critical stress is:\n$$ \\tau_{c} = \\frac{2T}{bL} $$\nThis expression represents the energetic barrier that must be overcome, as stipulated by requirement (iii).\n\nFor numerical implementation in a dynamic simulation, two other requirements are critical:\n1.  **Requirement (ii) - Time-Step Independence**: In a simulation with an explicit time step $\\Delta t$, the stress field $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}$ and thus $\\tau_{\\mathrm{res}}$ can fluctuate rapidly. A simple, instantaneous check if $\\tau_{\\mathrm{res}} > \\tau_{c}$ would make the results highly sensitive to the choice of $\\Delta t$. A numerically robust scheme must ensure that loop emission corresponds to a sustained stress condition, not a transient numerical spike. A common and effective method is to require the condition $\\tau_{\\mathrm{res}} > \\tau_{c}$ to hold for a certain physical \"dwell time\" or \"nucleation time,\" $t_{\\mathrm{nuc}}$, which is chosen based on physical considerations and must be independent of the simulation parameter $\\Delta t$.\n2.  **Requirement (i) - Burgers Vector Conservation**: The physical operation of a Frank–Read source conserves the total Burgers vector. A segment of the bowed-out loop with opposite line sense annihilates, pinching off a complete, closed loop and reconstituting the original source segment between the pinning points. Any numerical algorithm must correctly represent this topological change.\n\nNow, we evaluate each option based on these physical and numerical principles.\n\nA.

The proposed criterion, $\\kappa_{\\mathrm{mid}}\\ge 1/L$, corresponds to a radius of curvature $R \\le L$. This would trigger loop emission prematurely, before the energetic barrier is actually overcome.
