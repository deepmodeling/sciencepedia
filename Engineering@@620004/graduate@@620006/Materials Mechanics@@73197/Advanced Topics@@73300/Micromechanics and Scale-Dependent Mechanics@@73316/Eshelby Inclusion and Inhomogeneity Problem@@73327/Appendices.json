The eigenstrain $\\boldsymbol{\\epsilon}^* = \\epsilon_0\n\\mathbf{I}$ is purely dilatational, and there are no far-field loads. Consequently, the resulting displacement field $\\mathbf{u}$ must be purely radial, of the form $\\mathbf{u}(\\mathbf{x}) = u(r)\\hat{\\mathbf{r}}$, where $r = |\\mathbf{x}|$ is the radial coordinate and $\\hat{\\mathbf{r}}$ is the radial unit vector.\n\nFor such a displacement field, the non-zero components of the strain tensor $\\boldsymbol{\\epsilon}$ in spherical coordinates are the radial strain $\\epsilon_{rr} = \\frac{du}{dr}$ and the hoop strains $\\epsilon_{\\theta\\theta} = \\epsilon_{\\phi\\phi} = \\frac{u}{r}$.\n\nInside the inclusion ($r < a$), the problem specifies that the total strain is uniform and hydrostatic: $\\boldsymbol{\\epsilon}_{\\text{in}} = e\\,\\mathbf{I}$. In spherical coordinates, this implies $\\epsilon_{rr} = \\epsilon_{\\theta\\theta} = \\epsilon_{\\phi\\phi} = e$. From the definitions of strain components, we must have:\n$$\n\\frac{du_{\\text{in}}}{dr} = e \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\frac{u_{\\text{in}}}{r} = e\n$$\nThe only non-singular solution at the origin ($r=0$) satisfying both conditions is $u_{\\text{in}}(r) = er$. Thus, the displacement field within the inclusion is $\\mathbf{u}_{\\text{in}}(\\mathbf{r}) = e\\mathbf{r}$.\n\nIn the matrix ($r > a$), the displacement field must satisfy the Navier-Cauchy equations of equilibrium for an isotropic elastic solid in the absence of body forces:\n$$\n(\\lambda_m + \\mu_m) \\nabla(\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{u}_m) + \\mu_m \\nabla^2 \\mathbf{u}_m = \\mathbf{0}\n$$\nFor a radial displacement field $u_m(r)$, this equation reduces to a Cauchy-Euler ordinary differential equation:\n$$\nr^2 \\frac{d^2u_m}{dr^2} + 2r \\frac{du_m}{dr} - 2u_m = 0\n$$\nThe general solution is of the form $u_m(r) = Ar + \\frac{B}{r^2}$, where $A$ and $B$ are constants.\n\nThe boundary condition at infinity requires that the stress field vanishes, i.e., $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}_m(\\mathbf{x}) \\to \\mathbf{0}$ as $r \\to \\infty$.

The radial component is $\\sigma_{rr}^{\\text{in}} = 3\\kappa_i(e-\\epsilon_0)$.\n\nIn the matrix ($r > a$), with $u_m(r) = B/r^2$, the strain components are $\\epsilon_{rr}^m = -\\frac{2B}{r^3}$ and $\\epsilon_{\\theta\\theta}^m = \\epsilon_{\\phi\\phi}^m = \\frac{B}{r^3}$.

The matrix cannot exert any force on the inclusion. The boundary condition on the inclusion side is $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}_{\\text{in}} \\cdot \\hat{\\mathbf{r}} = \\mathbf{0}$ at $r=a$.\nThis requires the radial stress component to be zero:\n$$\n\\sigma_{rr}^{\\text{in}}(a) = 0\n$$\nUsing the expression for the stress inside the inclusion:\n$$\n3\\kappa_i(e-\\epsilon_0) = 0\n$$\nSince the inclusion's bulk modulus $\\kappa_i$ is a positive, non-zero material property, we must have:\n$$\ne-\\epsilon_0 = 0\n$$\nThis gives the strain amplitude $e_0$ for this limit:\n$$\ne_0 = \\epsilon_0\n$$\nPhysically, this result signifies that in the absence of mechanical constraint from the matrix, the inclusion is free to deform according to its natural stress-free transformation strain $\\boldsymbol{\\epsilon}^*$. The elastic strain inside the inclusion is zero, hence the stress is zero, which is consistent with the traction-free boundary condition.

It is scientifically grounded, relying on the established theories of linear elasticity and Eshelby's inclusion problem. The language is objective and precise. The problem is self-contained and well-posed, providing sufficient information and a clear objective: to determine the leading-order asymptotic dependence of the surface-induced strain correction. The condition $d \\gg a$ makes it an appropriate asymptotic problem. The provided hints about the dipole moment and image method are standard techniques for this class of problems. The problem does not violate any of the invalidity criteria.\n\nStep 3: Verdict.\nThe problem is valid. A solution will be derived.\n\nThe problem asks for the leading-order dependence of the surface-induced strain correction, $\\Delta\\varepsilon_{ij}$, on the geometric parameters $a$ and $d$. This correction arises from the interaction of the stress field of the inclusion with the traction-free surface at $z=0$.\n\nIn the limit where the inclusion is far from the surface ($d \\gg a$), its effect on the surrounding medium at distances large compared to $a$ is accurately represented by the field of a point elastic dipole located at the inclusion's center, $\\mathbf{x}_0 = (0,0,d)$. The moment of this dipole, $P_{ij}$, is given by the product of the stiffness tensor $C_{ijkl}$, the eigenstrain $\\varepsilon^{*}_{kl}$, and the volume of the inclusion $V$.\n$$P_{ij} = C_{ijkl}\\, \\varepsilon^{*}_{kl}\\, V = C_{ijkl}\\, \\varepsilon^{*}_{kl}\\, \\frac{4}{3}\\pi a^{3}$$\nThe tensor $P_{ij}$ is often called the \"stress-free strain moment\" and has units of force times length. Its magnitude is proportional to the volume of the inclusion, hence $\\|P_{ij}\\| \\propto a^3$.\n\nThe total elastic field in the half-space is the superposition of the field generated by the inclusion in an infinite medium, denoted by the superscript $(\\infty)$, and a correction field, denoted by the superscript $(c)$, which is introduced to satisfy the boundary condition of zero traction on the plane $z=0$.\nThe strain we seek, $\\Delta\\varepsilon_{ij}$, is this correction field evaluated within the inclusion's volume and averaged. Since the inclusion is small ($a \\ll d$), we can approximate this average by the value of the correction strain field at the center of the inclusion, $\\mathbf{x}_0$.\n$$\\Delta\\varepsilon_{ij} \\approx \\varepsilon^{(c)}_{ij}(\\mathbf{x}_0)$$\n\nThe correction field $\\varepsilon^{(c)}_{ij}(\\mathbf{x})$ can be determined using the method of images. The stress field $\\sigma^{(\\infty)}_{ij}$ from the original dipole at $\\mathbf{x}_0=(0,0,d)$ induces a non-zero traction $t_i = \\sigma^{(\\infty)}_{iz}$ on the plane $z=0$. To cancel this traction, an \"image\" system of elastic singularities is placed at the mirror point $\\mathbf{x}'_0 = (0,0,-d)$. This image system generates the correction field $\\varepsilon^{(c)}_{ij}(\\mathbf{x})$.\n\nThe task is to determine the scaling of $\\varepsilon^{(c)}_{ij}$ at the point $\\mathbf{x}_0$. The source of this field is the image system located at $\\mathbf{x}'_0$. The distance between the source of the correction field (the image system) and the point of observation (the inclusion center) is $R = |\\mathbf{x}_0 - \\mathbf{x}'_0| = |(0,0,d) - (0,0,-d)| = 2d$.\n\nThe strength and nature of the image system are determined by the original source (the dipole $P_{ij}$) and the boundary conditions. For a traction-free surface, the image of a dipole is, to leading order, another dipole, whose moment $P'_{ij}$ is linearly related to the original moment $P_{ij}$. The exact form of the image system is complex, involving not just a dipole but also other singularities as dictated by Mindlin's solution for a point force in a half-space. However, for a scaling argument, it is sufficient to recognize that the strength of the image system is proportional to the strength of the original source, i.e., $\\|P'_{ij}\\| \\propto \\|P_{ij}\\|$.\n\nThe strain field generated by a dipole source must be analyzed. The displacement field $u_k(\\mathbf{x})$ at a point $\\mathbf{x}$ due to a dipole of moment $P_{ij}$ at the origin is given by\n$$u_k(\\mathbf{x}) = P_{ij} \\frac{\\partial G_{ki}(\\mathbf{x})}{\\partial x_j}$$\nwhere $G_{ki}(\\mathbf{x})$ is the Kelvin solution (infinite-space Green's function), which scales as $1/|\\mathbf{x}|$. The derivative introduces a factor of $1/|\\mathbf{x}|$, so the displacement field from a dipole scales as $u \\sim P/r^2$. The strain field is the symmetric gradient of the displacement:\n$$\\varepsilon_{mn}(\\mathbf{x}) = \\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\frac{\\partial u_m}{\\partial x_n} + \\frac{\\partial u_n}{\\partial x_m}\\right) = \\frac{1}{2} P_{ij} \\left( \\frac{\\partial^2 G_{mi}}{\\partial x_n \\partial x_j} + \\frac{\\partial^2 G_{ni}}{\\partial x_m \\partial x_j} \\right)$$\nThis shows that the strain field is determined by the second derivatives of the Green's function. Since $G \\sim 1/r$, the second derivative $\\partial^2 G / \\partial x_k \\partial x_l$ scales as $1/r^3$. Consequently, the strain field at a distance $r$ from a dipole of moment $P$ scales as $\\|\\varepsilon\\| \\propto \\|P\\|/r^3$.\n\nWe apply this scaling law to our problem. The correction strain $\\Delta\\varepsilon_{ij}$ is the strain at $\\mathbf{x}_0$ generated by the image system (approximated as a dipole $P'$) located at $\\mathbf{x}'_0$. The distance is $r = R = 2d$. Therefore, the magnitude of the correction strain scales as:\n$$\\|\\Delta\\varepsilon_{ij}\\| \\propto \\frac{\\|P'\\|}{(2d)^3} \\propto \\frac{\\|P'\\|}{d^3}$$\nSince the image dipole strength is proportional to the original dipole strength, $\\|P'\\| \\propto \\|P\\|$, we have:\n$$\\|\\Delta\\varepsilon_{ij}\\| \\propto \\frac{\\|P\\|}{d^3}$$\nNow, we substitute the dependence of $P$ on the inclusion radius $a$.\n$$\\|P\\| \\propto V \\propto a^3$$\nCombining these results, we find the final scaling relation for the correction strain:\n$$\\|\\Delta\\varepsilon_{ij}\\| \\propto \\frac{a^3}{d^3}$$\nThe correction strain $\\Delta\\varepsilon_{ij}$ is a tensor that is linearly dependent on the eigenstrain $\\varepsilon^{*}_{kl}$. This is because the entire formulation is within linear elasticity: $P_{ij}$ is linear in $\\varepsilon^{*}_{kl}$, the image system strength $P'_{ij}$ is linear in $P_{ij}$, and the resulting strain field is linear in $P'_{ij}$. The dependence on geometry and material properties is contained in a fourth-rank tensor that multiplies $\\varepsilon^{*}_{kl}$, and this tensor is proportional to $(a/d)^3$.\n\nThe leading-order effect of the free surface is thus an additional strain contribution that decays as the inverse cube of the distance $d$ from the surface. The question asks for the single power-law factor in $d$ that multiplies the correction, expressed as a dimensionless combination of $a$ and $d$. This factor is evidently $(a/d)^3$ or $a^3/d^3$. Expressed as a dimensionless combination, $\\left(a/d\\right)$ raised to a power is the most direct form.\n\nThe controlling functions from which this scaling arises are the second spatial derivatives of the Green's function, such as $\\partial_k \\partial_l G_{ij}$, which dictate the strain field of a dipole source. The $1/d^3$ decay is characteristic of the strain field from a dipole at a distance $d$.\n\nThe required single leading-order power-law factor is the dimensionless combination of $a$ and $d$ that governs the magnitude of the correction. This factor is $\\left(\\frac{a}{d}\\right)^3$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\left(\\frac{a}{d}\\right)^{3}}\n$$", "id": "2884505"}, {"introduction": "The Eshelby theory is not just a predictive tool; it is a cornerstone of material characterization.
