The core of the problem lies in the principle of scale separation, which is fundamental to any homogenization theory. The first-order theory is valid only when the characteristic length scale of the microstructure, $a$, is significantly smaller than the characteristic length scale of the macroscopic strain field variation. We will formalize this condition.\n\nLet the macroscopic position vector be denoted by $\\mathbf{x}$ and the macroscopic strain tensor field be $\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}(\\mathbf{x})$. First-order homogenization schemes, based on a Representative Volume Element (RVE), approximate the strain field within the RVE as uniform, equal to the macroscopic strain $\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}$ at the centroid of the RVE. This approximation neglects the gradient of the macroscopic strain, $\\nabla\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}(\\mathbf{x})$, across the RVE. The accuracy of this approximation depends on how much $\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}(\\mathbf{x})$ actually varies over the RVE domain.\n\nWe use a first-order Taylor expansion of the macroscopic strain field $\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}(\\mathbf{x})$ around a point $\\mathbf{x}_0$, which we can take as the center of the RVE. For a point $\\mathbf{x}$ within the RVE, where $\\mathbf{x} = \\mathbf{x}_0 + \\Delta\\mathbf{x}$ and the magnitude of the displacement vector $\\|\\Delta\\mathbf{x}\\|$ is on the order of the RVE size (which is comparable to the unit cell size $a$), the strain is:\n$$ \\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}(\\mathbf{x}_0 + \\Delta\\mathbf{x}) \\approx \\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}(\\mathbf{x}_0) + \\nabla\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}|_{\\mathbf{x}_0} \\cdot \\Delta\\mathbf{x} $$\nHere, $\\nabla\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}$ is the third-order tensor representing the gradient of the strain field.\n\nThe variation of the strain across the RVE, $\\Delta\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}$, is the difference between the strain at a point and the strain at the center:\n$$ \\Delta\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon} = \\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}(\\mathbf{x}_0 + \\Delta\\mathbf{x}) - \\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}(\\mathbf{x}_0) \\approx \\nabla\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}|_{\\mathbf{x}_0} \\cdot \\Delta\\mathbf{x} $$\nTo quantify this variation in a relative sense, we consider the ratio of the norm of the strain variation to the norm of the strain itself. Taking $\\|\\Delta\\mathbf{x}\\| \\sim a$, the magnitude of the relative variation can be estimated as:\n$$ \\frac{\\|\\Delta\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}\\|}{\\|\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}(\\mathbf{x}_0)\\|} \\sim \\frac{\\|\\nabla\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}|_{\\mathbf{x}_0}\\| \\, \\|\\Delta\\mathbf{x}\\|}{\\|\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}(\\mathbf{x}_0)\\|} \\sim a \\left( \\frac{\\|\\nabla\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}\\|}{\\|\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}\\|} \\right) $$\nThe term in parentheses, $\\frac{\\|\\nabla\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}\\|}{\\|\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}\\|}$, has units of inverse length and represents the characteristic inverse length scale of the strain field variation. Let us denote this scale by $L_{\\varepsilon}^{-1}$. Thus, the relative variation of strain across one unit cell is proportional to $a \\cdot L_{\\varepsilon}^{-1}$.\n\nThe problem states that the macroscopic domain is a curved structure with a characteristic radius of curvature $R$. In such a scenario, for instance, under bending, the strain field typically varies linearly with the distance from a neutral surface. A classic example is a beam bent with radius $R$, where the axial strain is given by $\\varepsilon \\approx z/R$, with $z$ being the coordinate perpendicular to the neutral axis. The gradient of this strain is $\\frac{d\\varepsilon}{dz} = \\frac{1}{R}$. In a more general three-dimensional context, for deformations dominated by macroscopic curvature, the dominant component of the strain gradient scales with $1/R$. Therefore, it is justified to state that the characteristic inverse length scale of strain variation is of the order of $1/R$:\n$$ L_{\\varepsilon}^{-1} \\sim \\frac{1}{R} $$\nSubstituting this into our expression for the relative strain variation, we conclude that this variation is of the order of $a/R$. This ratio of two characteristic lengths, the microscopic length $a$ and the macroscopic length $R$, forms a natural dimensionless parameter that quantifies the separation of scales. We define this scale-separation parameter as:\n$$ \\eta = \\frac{a}{R} $$\nThis parameter must be small, $\\eta \\ll 1$, for the first-order homogenization to be valid.\n\nThe problem then provides a model for the relative error, $\\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{rel}}$, in a macroscopic quantity of interest (such as homogenized stiffness or stress) which arises from neglecting the strain gradient. This error is given by the inequality:\n$$ \\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{rel}} \\leq C\\,\\eta $$\nwith the constant $C$ specified as $C = 1$. Thus, the error model simplifies to:\n$$ \\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{rel}} \\leq \\eta $$\nA design tolerance is specified, requiring that the relative error must not exceed a value $\\delta = 3.0 \\times 10^{-2}$. This imposes the following constraint:\n$$ \\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{rel}} \\le \\delta $$\nCombining this design constraint with the error model, we obtain the condition that must be satisfied for the homogenization scheme to be considered sufficiently accurate:\n$$ \\eta \\le \\delta $$\nThe maximum admissible value of the scale-separation parameter, $\\eta_{\\max}$, is the value at which this inequality is saturated. Therefore:\n$$ \\eta_{\\max} = \\delta $$\nGiven $\\delta = 3.0 \\times 10^{-2}$, we find:\n$$ \\eta_{\\max} = 3.0 \\times 10^{-2} $$\nThe problem asks for this value to be rounded to $2$ significant figures.

The strain energy density of the composite is $W(\\bar{\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}}) = \\frac{1}{2} \\bar{\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}} : \\mathbf{C}_{\\mathrm{eff}} : \\bar{\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}}$. Any kinematically admissible strain field $\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}^*(\\mathbf{x})$ (i.e., a field derivable from a continuous displacement field satisfying the boundary conditions) will yield an energy greater than or equal to the actual energy.\nLet us choose a simple trial field: a uniform strain throughout the RVE, $\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}^*(\\mathbf{x}) = \\bar{\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}}$.

In engineering design, particularly for stiffness-critical applications, the worst case corresponds to the lowest possible material stiffness that must be accounted for. This guarantees a conservative design. The Reuss lower bound, $K_R$, represents this guaranteed minimum bulk modulus, irrespective of how the constituent phases are arranged.
