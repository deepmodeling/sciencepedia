A student asserts the following apparent counterexample to the Peach–Koehler (PK) relation: because the far-field applied stress is zero, the force per unit length predicted by the PK relation must be zero, hence the dislocation should have no driving force to move. However, standard energetic arguments and direct boundary-value solutions indicate that the dislocation experiences a net driving force toward the free surface that scales inversely with its distance $h$ from the surface. Which explanation most correctly resolves this paradox and restores consistency with the PK relation?\n\nA. The PK relation fails in the presence of boundaries; one must add an explicit boundary-traction term to the force law.

The stress $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}$ represents the stress field at the position of the dislocation core, but arising from **all sources other than the dislocation itself**. A dislocation cannot exert a net force on itself in a uniform, infinite medium.\n\nIn the given problem, the total stress field in the half-space, $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}_{\\text{total}}$, must satisfy the elastic equilibrium equations and the boundary conditions. The total field can be conceptually decomposed. The dislocation at $(0, h)$ creates a stress field, which we may denote as $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}_{\\infty}^{\\text{d}}$, as if it were in an infinite medium. However, this field $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}_{\\infty}^{\\text{d}}$ would produce a non-zero traction on the plane $y=0$. Since the problem specifies that this surface must be traction-free, another stress field must exist in the material to cancel these tractions. This additional field is called the **image stress**, $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}^{\\text{im}}$.\n\nThe image stress field $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}^{\\text{im}}$ is a solution to the elasticity equations in the half-space $y>0$ (with no singularities inside this domain) and is constructed to satisfy the boundary condition:\n$$ (\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}_{\\infty}^{\\text{d}} + \\boldsymbol{\\sigma}^{\\text{im}}) \\cdot \\hat{\\boldsymbol{n}} = \\boldsymbol{0} \\quad \\text{at} \\quad y=0 $$\nwhere $\\hat{\\boldsymbol{n}} = -\\hat{\\boldsymbol{y}}$ is the outward normal from the material.

(Note that the applied stress $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}^{\\text{applied}}$ is zero in this case).\n\nThe stress $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}$ to be used in the Peach–Koehler formula for the force on the dislocation at $(0, h)$ is the field from all other sources. Here, the \"other source\" is the free surface, whose effect is fully captured by the image stress field $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}^{\\text{im}}$. Therefore, we must evaluate $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma} = \\boldsymbol{\\sigma}^{\\text{im}}$ at the location of the dislocation, $(0, h)$.\n\nThe image field $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}^{\\text{im}}$ required to make the surface $y=0$ traction-free is identical to the stress field that would be generated by a fictitious \"image\" dislocation of opposite Burgers vector located at the mirror position $(0, -h)$.

The relative position vector from the image to the real dislocation is $(x', y') = (0 - 0, h - (-h)) = (0, 2h)$.

It has a magnitude of $\\frac{\\mu b^2}{4\\pi(1-\\nu)h}$ and is directed in the $-\\hat{\\boldsymbol{y}}$ direction, i.e., toward the free surface. This is a climb force. The magnitude indeed scales as $\\mu b^2/h$.\n\nThe student's paradox is resolved by realizing that the \"stress\" in the Peach–Koehler formula is not limited to externally applied far-field loads. It includes any stress field that is not the singular self-field of the dislocation in question. In this case, the image field, which represents the elastic relaxation due to the free boundary, provides the non-zero stress that drives the dislocation.\n\nNow we evaluate the given options.\n\n**A. The PK relation fails in the presence of boundaries; one must add an explicit boundary-traction term to the force law. The additional term generates a force toward the free surface even when the applied far-field stress is zero.**\nThis statement is fundamentally incorrect. The Peach–Koehler relation, $\\boldsymbol{f} = (\\boldsymbol{\\sigma} \\cdot \\boldsymbol{b}) \\times \\boldsymbol{\\xi}$, is a general and robust formula derived from fundamental energetic principles (the change in total potential energy of the body-plus-loading-system with respect to dislocation motion). It does not fail. The presence of boundaries is accounted for by solving the correct boundary value problem for the stress field $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}$, not by altering the force law itself. The assertion that the formula is incomplete is wrong.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**B. The stress entering the PK relation is the total elastic Cauchy stress evaluated at the dislocation line, excluding only the dislocation’s own singular self-stress. In a half-space with a traction-free boundary, the boundary induces a nonzero “image” stress at the dislocation even with zero applied far-field load. Including this image stress in the PK relation yields a net force toward the free surface with magnitude that scales like $\\mu b^{2}/h$, where $\\mu$ is the shear modulus.**\nThis statement provides a complete and correct resolution. It correctly defines the stress to be used in the formula. It correctly identifies the role of the boundary in inducing an image stress. It correctly states that this image stress, when used in the standard Peach–Koehler formula, produces the known force. Finally, it correctly identifies the scaling of this force with distance $h$, shear modulus $\\mu$, and Burgers vector magnitude $b$. Our derivation confirms the scaling is indeed proportional to $\\mu b^2/h$.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**C. Near a traction-free surface the Burgers vector is renormalized toward zero by relaxation, invalidating the PK relation’s use of the bulk Burgers vector. The observed motion is not mechanical; it arises from diffusion-driven climb that is outside the scope of the PK relation.**\nThis statement contains multiple falsehoods. The Burgers vector $\\boldsymbol{b}$ is a topological invariant defined by a Burgers circuit around the dislocation core. It is quantized by the crystal lattice and cannot be \"renormalized toward zero\" by elastic relaxation. The elastic fields are modified near a surface, but not the topological charge $\\boldsymbol{b}$. The claim that the motion is \"not mechanical\" is also a severe mischaracterization. The *driving force* is purely mechanical, arising from the minimization of elastic strain energy. While the *kinetic mechanism* of climb requires diffusion, the force itself is within the scope of mechanics and is precisely what the Peach–Koehler relation calculates.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. Only curved dislocations experience PK forces because only curvature changes the elastic energy under translation. A straight edge dislocation in an unloaded body cannot move unless it bows out, so any apparent force toward the surface reflects numerical artifacts rather than physics.**\nThis statement is entirely wrong. A straight dislocation most certainly experiences a force when placed in a stress field, uniform or not. The force per unit length is well-defined. The idea that only curvature matters relates to the concept of line tension, which is a restorative force resisting bending, not the external force driving motion. A straight dislocation moving in a spatially varying stress field (like the image stress field) changes the system's energy, which is the origin of the force. The image force is a fundamental physical effect, confirmed by theory and experiment, not a \"numerical artifact\".\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2907480"}, {"introduction": "The motion and shape of dislocations are governed by a constant interplay of forces.

Any infinitesimal segment of the dislocation line, $ds$, must be in static equilibrium. Two forces act on this segment: the Peach–Koehler force, which drives the bowing, and the line tension force, which resists it.\n\n1.  **Peach–Koehler Force:** A uniform resolved shear stress $\\tau$ acting on a dislocation with Burgers vector of magnitude $b$ creates a force per unit length, $f_{PK}$.

Let the radius of this circle be $R$. The curvature is $\\kappa = \\frac{1}{R}$. Therefore, the radius of the circular arc is:\n$$R = \\frac{\\Gamma}{\\tau b}$$\n\nThe task now is to find the equation $y(x)$ of this circular arc that satisfies the given boundary conditions. The problem states that the pinning points are at $(x,y) = (\\pm \\frac{L}{2}, 0)$ and that the bowing is symmetric about the $y$-axis.

For this shape, the maximum displacement at $x=0$ is $y(0) = \\sqrt{R^2 - \\frac{L^2}{4}} - R$, which is negative because $R > \\sqrt{R^2 - \\frac{L^2}{4}}$. This describes bowing in the $-y$ direction, which contradicts the problem statement.\nCase 2: $y_c = -\\sqrt{R^2 - \\frac{L^2}{4}}$. The center of the circle is below the $x$-axis. The shape is $y(x) = -\\sqrt{R^2 - \\frac{L^2}{4}} \\pm \\sqrt{R^2 - x^2}$.

For this shape, the maximum displacement at $x=0$ is $y(0) = R - \\sqrt{R^2 - \\frac{L^2}{4}}$, which is positive.
