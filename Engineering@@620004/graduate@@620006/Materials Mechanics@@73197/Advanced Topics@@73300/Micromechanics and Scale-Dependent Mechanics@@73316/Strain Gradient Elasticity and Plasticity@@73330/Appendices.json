The essential boundary conditions are $u(0)=0$ and $u(L)=0$, which implies that the admissible variations must satisfy $\\delta u(0)=0$ and $\\delta u(L)=0$.

These are the natural boundary conditions, which correspond physically to the absence of externally applied double forces (moments):\n$$\nE \\ell^2 u''(0) = 0 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad E \\ell^2 u''(L) = 0.\n$$\nAs $E>0$ and $\\ell>0$, these simplify to $u''(0) = 0$ and $u''(L) = 0$.\n\n**2) Solution of the Boundary Value Problem**\n\nThe complete boundary value problem is:\n- ODE: $u'''' - \\frac{1}{\\ell^2} u'' = \\frac{b}{E \\ell^2}$ for $x \\in (0,L)$.\n- BCs: $u(0)=0$, $u(L)=0$, $u''(0)=0$, $u''(L)=0$.\n\nThe general solution is the sum of a particular solution $u_p(x)$ and the homogeneous solution $u_h(x)$.\nFor the particular solution, we try a polynomial $u_p(x) = C x^2$. Substituting into the ODE:\n$0 - \\frac{1}{\\ell^2}(2C) = \\frac{b}{E \\ell^2} \\implies C = -\\frac{b}{2E}$. Thus, $u_p(x) = -\\frac{b}{2E}x^2$.\n\nFor the homogeneous solution, the characteristic equation is $r^4 - \\frac{1}{\\ell^2}r^2 = 0$, or $r^2(r^2 - 1/\\ell^2)=0$. The roots are $r_1=r_2=0$, $r_3=1/\\ell$, and $r_4=-1/\\ell$. The homogeneous solution is:\n$$\nu_h(x) = C_1 + C_2 x + C_3 \\cosh(x/\\ell) + C_4 \\sinh(x/\\ell).\n$$\nThe general solution is:\n$$\nu(x) = C_1 + C_2 x + C_3 \\cosh(x/\\ell) + C_4 \\sinh(x/\\ell) - \\frac{b}{2E} x^2.\n$$\nWe need its second derivative to apply the natural BCs:\n$$\nu''(x) = \\frac{C_3}{\\ell^2} \\cosh(x/\\ell) + \\frac{C_4}{\\ell^2} \\sinh(x/\\ell) - \\frac{b}{E}.\n$$\nApplying the boundary conditions:\n- $u''(0)=0 \\implies \\frac{C_3}{\\ell^2} - \\frac{b}{E} = 0 \\implies C_3 = \\frac{b\\ell^2}{E}$.\n- $u''(L)=0 \\implies \\frac{C_3}{\\ell^2} \\cosh(L/\\ell) + \\frac{C_4}{\\ell^2} \\sinh(L/\\ell) - \\frac{b}{E} = 0$. Substituting $C_3$:\n  $\\frac{b}{E} \\cosh(L/\\ell) + \\frac{C_4}{\\ell^2} \\sinh(L/\\ell) - \\frac{b}{E} = 0 \\implies C_4 = \\frac{b\\ell^2}{E} \\frac{1-\\cosh(L/\\ell)}{\\sinh(L/\\ell)} = -\\frac{b\\ell^2}{E} \\tanh(L/(2\\ell))$.\n- $u(0)=0 \\implies C_1 + C_3 = 0 \\implies C_1 = -C_3 = -\\frac{b\\ell^2}{E}$.\n- $u(L)=0 \\implies C_1 + C_2 L + C_3 \\cosh(L/\\ell) + C_4 \\sinh(L/\\ell) - \\frac{b}{2E} L^2 = 0$.\n  Substitute the known constants:\n  $-\\frac{b\\ell^2}{E} + C_2 L + \\frac{b\\ell^2}{E}\\cosh(L/\\ell) - \\frac{b\\ell^2}{E} \\tanh(L/(2\\ell)) \\sinh(L/\\ell) - \\frac{b}{2E} L^2 = 0$.\n  The term $\\frac{b\\ell^2}{E}\\cosh(L/\\ell) - \\frac{b\\ell^2}{E} \\tanh(L/(2\\ell)) \\sinh(L/\\ell)$ simplifies. It is equal to $C_3 \\cosh(L/\\ell) + C_4 \\sinh(L/\\ell) = \\ell^2 \\left( \\frac{C_3}{\\ell^2} \\cosh(L/\\ell) + \\frac{C_4}{\\ell^2} \\sinh(L/\\ell) \\right) = \\ell^2 (\\frac{b}{E}) = \\frac{b\\ell^2}{E}$.\n  So the equation for $C_2$ becomes:\n  $-\\frac{b\\ell^2}{E} + C_2 L + \\frac{b\\ell^2}{E} - \\frac{b}{2E} L^2 = 0 \\implies C_2 L = \\frac{bL^2}{2E} \\implies C_2 = \\frac{bL}{2E}$.\n\nSubstituting the constants back into the general solution:\n$$\nu(x) = -\\frac{b\\ell^2}{E} + \\frac{bL}{2E} x - \\frac{b}{2E} x^2 + \\frac{b\\ell^2}{E} \\cosh(x/\\ell) - \\frac{b\\ell^2}{E} \\tanh(L/(2\\ell)) \\sinh(x/\\ell).\n$$\nThis expression can be rearranged to group classical and non-classical terms.\n\n**3) Boundary-Layer Structure**\n\nTo make the structure explicit, we group the terms as follows:\n$$\nu(x) = \\frac{b}{2E} (Lx - x^2) + \\frac{b\\ell^2}{E} \\left( \\cosh(x/\\ell) - \\tanh(L/(2\\ell)) \\sinh(x/\\ell) - 1 \\right).\n$$\nThe first term, $u_{cl}(x)=\\frac{b}{2E}(Lx-x^2)$, is the classical parabolic displacement profile for a bar without gradient effects. The second term is the correction due to strain gradients. The hyperbolic part can be simplified using the identity $\\cosh(A-B) = \\cosh A \\cosh B - \\sinh A \\sinh B$:\n$$\n\\cosh(x/\\ell) - \\tanh(L/(2\\ell)) \\sinh(x/\\ell) = \\frac{\\cosh(x/\\ell)\\cosh(L/(2\\ell)) - \\sinh(L/(2\\ell))\\sinh(x/\\ell)}{\\cosh(L/(2\\ell))} = \\frac{\\cosh(\\frac{x}{\\ell}-\\frac{L}{2\\ell})}{\\cosh(L/(2\\ell))}.\n$$\nSince $\\cosh$ is an even function, this is also equal to $\\frac{\\cosh(\\frac{L}{2\\ell}-\\frac{x}{\\ell})}{\\cosh(L/(2\\ell))}$ or $\\frac{\\cosh(\\frac{x-L/2}{\\ell})}{\\cosh(L/(2\\ell))}$.\nThe final, compact expression for the displacement field is:\n$$\nu(x) = \\frac{b}{2E} x(L-x) + \\frac{b\\ell^2}{E} \\left( \\frac{\\cosh(\\frac{x-L/2}{\\ell})}{\\cosh(L/2\\ell)} - 1 \\right).\n$$\nThis form explicitly shows the classical parabolic solution modified by a correction term. The correction is governed by the material length $\\ell$. The hyperbolic cosine terms create boundary layers of characteristic thickness $\\ell$ near $x=0$ and $x=L$. Inside these layers, the gradient elasticity solution deviates significantly from the classical one to satisfy the higher-order boundary conditions $u''=0$.

Express your final relation for the curvature up to order $\\ell^2$ in terms of the classical bending moment $M(x)$ and its derivatives, and only then integrate to obtain $w(x)$ under appropriate boundary conditions.\n\n3) Using your leading-order relation, construct an algorithm that computes the deflection $w(x)$ up to order $\\ell^2$ for the following boundary value problems. All answers must be expressed in meters, with $x$ in meters, $E I$ in $\\mathrm{N}\\,\\mathrm{m}^2$, $q$ in $\\mathrm{N}/\\mathrm{m}$, and applied end moments in $\\mathrm{N}\\,\\mathrm{m}$.

Geometric boundary conditions at the clamped end $x = 0$ are $w(0) = 0$ and $w'(0) = 0$. Natural boundary conditions at the free end $x = L$ are vanishing bending moment and shear force.

A constant end moment $M_0 = 2000\\,\\mathrm{N}\\,\\mathrm{m}$ is applied at $x = L$, causing a constant internal moment $M(x) = M_0$ along the span in static equilibrium. Geometric boundary conditions at $x = 0$ are $w(0) = 0$ and $w'(0) = 0$. Report the tip deflection at $x = L$.\n- Case D (recovery check, simply supported, uniform load with $\\ell = 0$): identical to Case A except $\\ell = 0\\,\\mathrm{m}$.

It is a standard application of variational methods and perturbation theory to a first-order strain gradient elasticity model for beams. The formulation is self-contained, and the data provided for each case are complete and consistent. The problem is not trivial and requires a detailed derivation based on fundamental principles of mechanics.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\n\nThe problem is **valid**. A complete solution will be provided.\n\n**Task 1: Derivation of the Governing Equation**\n\nThe total potential energy is given by a functional $\\Pi[w]$. The governing differential equation and natural boundary conditions are found by setting the first variation of this functional to zero, $\\delta\\Pi = 0$, for all admissible variations $\\delta w(x)$. The Lagrangian density is $\\mathcal{L}(w, w'', w''') = \\frac{1}{2}EI\\left((w'')^2 + \\ell^2(w''')^2\\right) - q(x)w$.\n\nThe variation is:\n$$ \\delta\\Pi = \\int_0^L \\left( \\frac{\\partial \\mathcal{L}}{\\partial w}\\delta w + \\frac{\\partial \\mathcal{L}}{\\partial w''}\\delta w'' + \\frac{\\partial \\mathcal{L}}{\\partial w'''}\\delta w''' \\right) dx = \\int_0^L \\left( -q\\delta w + EIw''\\delta w'' + EI\\ell^2w'''\\delta w''' \\right) dx = 0 $$\nUsing integration by parts on the terms containing derivatives of $\\delta w$:\n$$ \\int_0^L EIw''\\delta w'' dx = \\int_0^L EIw'' \\frac{d^2(\\delta w)}{dx^2} dx = \\left[ EIw'' \\frac{d(\\delta w)}{dx} \\right]_0^L - \\left[ \\frac{d(EIw'')}{dx} \\delta w \\right]_0^L + \\int_0^L \\frac{d^2(EIw'')}{dx^2} \\delta w dx $$\n$$ \\int_0^L EI\\ell^2w'''\\delta w''' dx = \\dots = -\\left[ \\frac{d(EI\\ell^2w''')}{dx} \\frac{d(\\delta w)}{dx} \\right]_0^L + \\left[ \\frac{d^2(EI\\ell^2w''')}{dx^2} \\delta w \\right]_0^L - \\int_0^L \\frac{d^3(EI\\ell^2w''')}{dx^3} \\delta w dx $$\nCollecting all integral terms, we have:\n$$ \\int_0^L \\left( \\frac{d^2(EIw'')}{dx^2} - \\frac{d^3(EI\\ell^2w''')}{dx^3} - q(x) \\right) \\delta w \\, dx + \\text{Boundary Terms} = 0 $$\nFor an arbitrary variation $\\delta w$ in the domain $(0, L)$, the integrand must vanish, yielding the Euler-Lagrange equation. Assuming $EI$ and $\\ell$ are constants:\n$$ EIw'''' - EI\\ell^2 w'''''' = q(x) $$\nThis is the sixth-order differential equation governing the deflection $w(x)$.\n\nIn the limit $\\ell \\to 0$, the term $EI\\ell^2w''''''$ vanishes, provided the solution $w(x)$ is sufficiently smooth such that its sixth derivative remains bounded. The equation reduces to:\n$$ EIw'''' = q(x) $$\nThis is precisely the classical Euler-Bernoulli beam equation. The convergence of the solution of the full equation to the solution of the reduced equation constitutes a regular perturbation problem, justifying this limit.\n\n**Task 2: Perturbation Expansion**\n\nWe seek a solution of the form $w(x) = w_0(x) + \\ell^2 w_1(x) + \\mathcal{O}(\\ell^4)$. Substituting this into the governing equation:\n$$ EI(w_0'''' + \\ell^2 w_1'''') - EI\\ell^2(w_0'''''' + \\ell^2 w_1'''''') = q(x) $$\nCollecting terms by powers of $\\ell^2$:\n- $\\mathcal{O}(\\ell^0)$: $EIw_0'''' = q(x)$\n- $\\mathcal{O}(\\ell^2)$: $EIw_1'''' - EIw_0'''''' = 0 \\implies EIw_1'''' = EIw_0''''''$\n\nFrom the zeroth-order equation, we can differentiate twice to get $EIw_0'''''' = q''(x)$. Substituting this into the first-order equation gives:\n$$ EIw_1'''' = q''(x) $$\nThe full equation for $w(x)$ up to order $\\mathcal{O}(\\ell^2)$ is obtained by summing the two results:\n$$ EIw'''' = EIw_0'''' + \\ell^2 EIw_1'''' = q(x) + \\ell^2 q''(x) $$\nTo find the curvature $\\kappa(x) = w''(x)$, we integrate this equation twice with respect to $x$. Let $M_{cl}(x)$ be any function satisfying $M_{cl}''(x) = q(x)$.\n$$ EIw''(x) = M_{cl}(x) + \\ell^2 q(x) + C_1 x + C_2 $$\nThis is the required relation for the curvature, where $C_1$ and $C_2$ are integration constants. The full set of four constants (two implicit in the choice of $M_{cl}$ and two explicit, $C_1, C_2$) are determined by imposing the four boundary conditions on the deflection $w(x)$ obtained by integrating this curvature relation twice.\n\n**Task 3: Algorithm and Computation**\n\nThe perturbation analysis provides a systematic algorithm. The total deflection $w = w_0 + \\ell^2 w_1$ is found by solving two separate boundary value problems:\n1.  **Classical Problem for $w_0$**: Solve $EIw_0'''' = q(x)$ with the specified *classical* boundary conditions.\n2.  **Correction Problem for $w_1$**: Solve $EIw_1'''' = q''(x)$ with appropriate boundary conditions. These are derived by applying the perturbation expansion to the full problem's boundary conditions. For geometric boundary conditions of the form $w(a)=c$ or $w'(a)=d$, the corresponding conditions for the correction problem are homogeneous: $w_1(a)=0$ and $w_1'(a)=0$. For natural boundary conditions, a more detailed analysis is required. The full bending moment is $M_{full} = EI(w'' - \\ell^2 w'''') = EI(w_0'' + \\ell^2w_1'' - \\ell^2w_0'''')+\\mathcal{O}(\\ell^4)$.\n\n**Case A: Simply supported, uniform load**\nFor a simply supported beam, the full moment $M_{full}$ must be zero at the ends. Expanding $M_{full}$ and setting it to zero at the boundaries gives the boundary conditions for each order. For $\\mathcal{O}(\\ell^0)$, we have the classical condition $EIw_0''(0)=0$ and $EIw_0''(L)=0$. For $\\mathcal{O}(\\ell^2)$, we have $EIw_1''(0) = EIw_0''''(0) = q(0)=q_0$ and similarly $EIw_1''(L)=q(L)=q_0$.\nThe problem for the correction term is thus to solve $EIw_1''''=0$ (since $q''=0$) with boundary conditions $w_1(0)=0, w_1(L)=0, EIw_1''(0)=q_0, EIw_1''(L)=q_0$. The solution is $w_1(x) = \\frac{q_0}{2EI}(x^2-Lx)$. The total deflection is $w(x) = w_0(x) + \\ell^2 w_1(x)$.\nAt mid-span:\n$w_0(L/2) = \\frac{5 q_0 L^4}{384 EI}$ and $w_1(L/2) = \\frac{q_0}{2EI}((L/2)^2 - L(L/2)) = -\\frac{q_0 L^2}{8EI}$.\n$$ w(L/2) = \\frac{5 q_0 L^4}{384 EI} - \\ell^2 \\frac{q_0 L^2}{8EI} $$\nSubstituting values: $L=2.0, EI=2\\times 10^7, q_0=1000, \\ell=0.05$.\n$w_0(L/2) = \\frac{5 \\cdot 1000 \\cdot 2^4}{384 \\cdot 2\\cdot 10^7} \\approx 1.041667 \\times 10^{-5}$.\n$\\ell^2 w_1(L/2) = -(0.05)^2 \\frac{1000 \\cdot 2^2}{8 \\cdot 2\\cdot 10^7} = -6.25 \\times 10^{-8}$.\n$w(L/2) \\approx 1.035417 \\times 10^{-5}\\,\\mathrm{m}$.\n\n**Case B: Cantilever, sinusoidal load**\n$q(x) = q_0 \\sin(\\alpha x)$ where $\\alpha = \\pi/L$. $q''(x) = -q_0 \\alpha^2 \\sin(\\alpha x)$.\nProblem for $w_0$: $EIw_0'''' = q_0\\sin(\\alpha x)$ with $w_0(0)=w_0'(0)=0$ (clamped) and $w_0''(L)=w_0'''(L)=0$ (free).\nSolving yields the tip deflection:\n$$ w_0(L) = \\frac{q_0}{EI} \\left( \\frac{L^3}{3\\alpha} - \\frac{L}{\\alpha^3} \\right) = \\frac{q_0 L^4}{EI \\pi} \\left(\\frac{1}{3} - \\frac{1}{\\pi^2}\\right) $$\nProblem for $w_1$: $EIw_1'''' = -q_0 \\alpha^2 \\sin(\\alpha x)$ with $w_1(0)=w_1'(0)=0$. For a free end, the natural BCs for the correction are $EIw_1''(L)=q(L)=0$ and $EIw_1'''(L)=q'(L)=-q_0\\alpha$.\nSolving yields the tip deflection for the correction term:\n$$ w_1(L) = \\frac{1}{EI} \\left( \\frac{q_0 L}{\\alpha} \\right) = \\frac{q_0 L^2}{EI \\pi} $$\nThe total tip deflection is $w(L) = w_0(L) + \\ell^2 w_1(L)$:\n$$ w(L) = \\frac{q_0 L^2}{EI \\pi} \\left[ L^2\\left(\\frac{1}{3} - \\frac{1}{\\pi^2}\\right) + \\ell^2 \\right] $$\nSubstituting values $L=1.5, EI=3.0\\times 10^6, q_0=500, \\ell=0.02$:\n$$ w(1.5) \\approx 6.23493 \\times 10^{-5}\\,\\mathrm{m} $$\n\n**Case C: Cantilever, pure end moment**\n$q(x)=0$, so $q''(x)=0$. The correction problem $EIw_1'''' = 0$ must be solved.\n$w_1(0)=0, w_1'(0)=0$. The natural BCs are $EIw_1''(L)=q(L)=0$ and $EIw_1'''(L)=q'(L)=0$.\nThe unique solution is $w_1(x) \\equiv 0$. The gradient effect is zero.\nThe solution is the classical one for a cantilever with an end moment $M_0$:\n$$ w(x) = w_0(x) = \\frac{M_0 x^2}{2EI} $$\nThe tip deflection is:\n$$ w(L) = \\frac{M_0 L^2}{2EI} = \\frac{2000 \\times (1.0)^2}{2 \\times (5.0 \\times 10^6)} = \\frac{2000}{10^7} = 2.0 \\times 10^{-4}\\,\\mathrm{m} $$\n\n**Case D: Recovery check, $\\ell=0$**\nThis case is identical to the classical part of Case A.
