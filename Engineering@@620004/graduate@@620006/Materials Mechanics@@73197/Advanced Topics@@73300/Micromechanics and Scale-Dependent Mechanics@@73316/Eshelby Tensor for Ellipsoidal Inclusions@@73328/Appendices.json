In this context, we can represent this relationship as the action of a linear operator, $\\mathbf{S}$, on the six-dimensional vector space of symmetric second-order tensors. Let $\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}^{c}$ and $\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}^{*}$ be the constrained strain and eigenstrain tensors, respectively. Then, we write $\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}^{c} = \\mathbf{S}(\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}^{*})$.\n\nThe problem states that this operator $\\mathbf{S}$ is symmetric. A symmetric linear operator on a finite-dimensional vector space is guaranteed to be diagonalizable and possess a complete set of orthogonal eigenvectors. These eigenvectors, in our context, are called the eigenmodes or principal strains of the Eshelby tensor. Let these eigenmodes be denoted by $\\boldsymbol{e}^{(\\alpha)}$ and the corresponding real eigenvalues by $s^{(\\alpha)}$, for $\\alpha = 1, \\dots, 6$. The action of the operator on an eigenmode is defined by:\n$$\n\\mathbf{S}(\\boldsymbol{e}^{(\\alpha)}) = s^{(\\alpha)} \\boldsymbol{e}^{(\\alpha)}\n$$\nSince the eigenmodes form a basis, any eigenstrain tensor $\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}^{*}$ can be expressed as a linear combination of these eigenmodes:\n$$\n\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}^{*} = \\sum_{\\alpha=1}^{6} a_{\\alpha} \\boldsymbol{e}^{(\\alpha)}\n$$\nwhere $a_{\\alpha}$ are the scalar components of $\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}^{*}$ in this principal basis. Applying the operator $\\mathbf{S}$ to this expansion, we find the resulting constrained strain $\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}^{c}$:\n$$\n\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}^{c} = \\mathbf{S}(\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}^{*}) = \\mathbf{S}\\left(\\sum_{\\alpha=1}^{6} a_{\\alpha} \\boldsymbol{e}^{(\\alpha)}\\right) = \\sum_{\\alpha=1}^{6} a_{\\alpha} \\mathbf{S}(\\boldsymbol{e}^{(\\alpha)}) = \\sum_{\\alpha=1}^{6} a_{\\alpha} s^{(\\alpha)} \\boldsymbol{e}^{(\\alpha)}\n$$\nTo invert this relationship, we must express $\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}^{*}$ in terms of $\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}^{c}$. We can also express the measured constrained strain $\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}^{c}$ in the same principal basis:\n$$\n\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}^{c} = \\sum_{\\alpha=1}^{6} b_{\\alpha} \\boldsymbol{e}^{(\\alpha)}\n$$\nwhere the coefficients $b_{\\alpha}$ are known from measurement. By comparing the two expressions for $\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}^{c}$, we see the relationship between the coefficients:\n$$\nb_{\\alpha} = a_{\\alpha} s^{(\\alpha)}\n$$\nAssuming all eigenvalues $s^{(\\alpha)}$ are non-zero, which is true for any physically realistic elastic material, we can solve for $a_{\\alpha}$:\n$$\na_{\\alpha} = \\frac{b_{\\alpha}}{s^{(\\alpha)}}\n$$\nSubstituting this back into the expansion for $\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}^{*}$, we obtain the inverted relationship:\n$$\n\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}^{*} = \\sum_{\\alpha=1}^{6} \\frac{b_{\\alpha}}{s^{(\\alpha)}} \\boldsymbol{e}^{(\\alpha)}\n$$\nThis procedure constitutes the inversion of the operator $\\mathbf{S}$ in its spectral basis. It is equivalent to applying the inverse operator $\\mathbf{S}^{-1}$, whose eigenvalues are $1/s^{(\\alpha)}$.\n\nNext, we address the invariance of the shear subspace and the status of pure shears as eigenmodes. The coordinate system is aligned with the principal axes of the ellipsoid. The ellipsoid is therefore symmetric with respect to reflections across the coordinate planes ($x_1=0$, $x_2=0$, $x_3=0$). The governing equations of linear isotropic elasticity are also invariant under such reflections. By Neumann's principle, the symmetry of the cause must be reflected in the symmetry of the effect.\nConsider a pure shear eigenstrain, for instance, in the $x_1$-$x_2$ plane, represented by a tensor $\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}^{*}$ with only non-zero components $\\varepsilon^{*}_{12}$ and $\\varepsilon^{*}_{21}$. This strain field has specific symmetry properties. For example, it is anti-symmetric with respect to reflection through the $x_1=0$ plane and the $x_2=0$ plane. Any normal strain components ($e.g., \\varepsilon_{11}, \\varepsilon_{22}, \\varepsilon_{33}$) are symmetric with respect to these reflections. Because the cause ($\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}^{*}$) is anti-symmetric, any symmetric effect (normal strains) must be zero. Therefore, a pure shear eigenstrain cannot induce normal constrained strains.\nFurthermore, consider the coupling between different shear planes. A shear strain $\\varepsilon_{12}$ is symmetric with respect to reflection through the $x_3=0$ plane, whereas a shear strain $\\varepsilon_{13}$ is anti-symmetric. Thus, an eigenstrain $\\varepsilon^{*}_{12}$ cannot produce a constrained strain $\\varepsilon^{c}_{13}$.\nThis lack of coupling means that components of the Eshelby tensor like $S_{1112}$, $S_{1213}$, etc., must be zero. Consequently, an eigenstrain that is a pure shear in one of the coordinate planes will only produce a constrained strain that is also a pure shear in the same plane. This demonstrates that the subspaces spanned by each of the pure engineering shears $\\{\\varepsilon_{12}\\}$, $\\{\\varepsilon_{13}\\}$, and $\\{\\varepsilon_{23}\\}$ are invariant under the operator $\\mathbf{S}$. Since these are one-dimensional invariant subspaces, the basis vectors themselves (the pure shear states) must be eigenvectors, or eigenmodes, of the operator $\\mathbf{S}$. This justifies the problem's premise.\n\nNow, we proceed to the calculation. We are given the measured constrained strain tensor $\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}^{c}$, which has only one non-zero component in the specified basis:\n$$\n\\varepsilon^{c}_{23} = 7.5 \\times 10^{-5}\n$$\nAll other components, $\\varepsilon^{c}_{ij}$ for $(i,j) \\neq (2,3)$ or $(3,2)$, are zero. This means the measured strain tensor $\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}^{c}$ is aligned with the pure shear eigenmode $\\boldsymbol{e}_{23}$.\nIn the spectral basis expansion $\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}^{c} = \\sum b_{\\alpha} \\boldsymbol{e}^{(\\alpha)}$, only the coefficient corresponding to the $\\boldsymbol{e}_{23}$ eigenmode is non-zero. Let this eigenmode be $\\boldsymbol{e}^{(k)}$. Then $b_k \\neq 0$ and $b_{\\alpha}=0$ for $\\alpha \\neq k$. Specifically, the measured strain is $\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}^c = (7.5 \\times 10^{-5}) \\cdot \\hat{\\boldsymbol{e}}_{23}$, where $\\hat{\\boldsymbol{e}}_{23}$ is a unit tensor for pure shear in the $2$-$3$ plane.\n\nUsing the inversion formula, the eigenstrain $\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}^{*}$ will also have only one non-zero component, $a_k$, in this basis:\n$$\na_k = \\frac{b_k}{s_k}\n$$\nThis means the resulting eigenstrain is also a pure shear in the $2$-$3$ plane. The component $\\varepsilon^{*}_{23}$ is related to the measured component $\\varepsilon^{c}_{23}$ by the corresponding eigenvalue $s_{23}$:\n$$\n\\varepsilon^{c}_{23} = s_{23} \\varepsilon^{*}_{23}\n$$\nWe are given $s_{23} = 0.41$. We can now solve for $\\varepsilon^{*}_{23}$:\n$$\n\\varepsilon^{*}_{23} = \\frac{\\varepsilon^{c}_{23}}{s_{23}} = \\frac{7.5 \\times 10^{-5}}{0.41}\n$$\nPerforming the division:\n$$\n\\varepsilon^{*}_{23} \\approx 1.829268... \\times 10^{-4}\n$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be expressed in microstrain, where $1$ microstrain $= 1 \\times 10^{-6}$.
