The premises, including the description of the dislocation fields, the strain energy, and the core cutoff regularization, are consistent with established textbook models. The problem is scientifically sound, well-posed, and allows for rigorous analysis. We shall now proceed to evaluate each statement.\n\nThe fundamental quantities are the stress fields and elastic energies per unit length for screw and edge dislocations.\n\nFor a screw dislocation along the $z$-axis with Burgers vector $\\mathbf{b} = b\\,\\mathbf{e}_z$, the only non-zero stress component in cylindrical coordinates $(r, \\theta, z)$ is $\\sigma_{\\theta z} = \\sigma_{z \\theta} = \\frac{\\mu b}{2\\pi r}$. The deformation is a state of pure shear, and the stress field is independent of Poisson's ratio $\\nu$. The elastic strain energy density is $w_{\\text{screw}} = \\frac{\\sigma_{\\theta z}^2}{2\\mu} = \\frac{\\mu b^2}{8\\pi^2 r^2}$.\n\nFor an edge dislocation along the $z$-axis with Burgers vector $\\mathbf{b} = b\\,\\mathbf{e}_x$, the stress field under plane strain conditions is more complex and depends on both $\\mu$ and $\\nu$. The components decay as $1/r$, for example $\\sigma_{r\\theta} = \\frac{\\mu b}{2\\pi(1-\\nu)} \\frac{\\cos\\theta}{r}$. The elastic strain energy density $w_{\\text{edge}}$ is quadratic in the stress components and thus scales as $1/r^2$.\n\nThe elastic energy per unit length, $U/L$, is computed by integrating the energy density $w$ over the annular area between the core radius $r_0$ and the outer cutoff $R$:\n$$ \\frac{U}{L} = \\int_{r_0}^{R} \\int_{0}^{2\\pi} w(r, \\theta) \\, r \\, d\\theta \\, dr $$\n\nWith this foundation, we analyze each option.\n\nA. For an edge dislocation in plane strain, excising a circular core of radius $r_0$ and integrating the elastic energy density over $r_0<r<R$ yields an energy per unit length\n$$\n\\frac{U_{\\text{edge}}}{L}=\\frac{\\mu\\,b^{2}}{4\\pi\\,(1-\\nu)}\\ln\\frac{R}{r_0}+C_{\\text{core}},\n$$\nwhere $C_{\\text{core}}$ is a constant independent of $R$ but dependent on details of the core regularization; the coefficient of the logarithm is independent of the core model.\n\nThis statement is correct. The calculation of the elastic energy of an edge dislocation in the domain $r_0 < r < R$ is a standard result. While direct integration of $w_{\\text{edge}}$ is tedious, a more direct derivation based on the work done on the cut plane gives the result for the elastic energy stored in this annulus as precisely $\\frac{\\mu b^2}{4\\pi(1-\\nu)} \\ln\\frac{R}{r_0}$. This term depends on the Poisson's ratio $\\nu$. The total energy is then expressed by adding a term $C_{\\text{core}}$ which represents the energy of the highly strained core region $r < r_0$. This core energy depends on the specific atomic arrangement, i.e., the core model, but not on the macroscopic dimension $R$. The prefactor of the logarithm is a direct consequence of the far-field elastic solution and is therefore independent of the core model. Verdict: **Correct**.\n\nB. Introducing the cutoff by removing the region $r<r_0$ necessarily modifies the analytical form of the far-field stress for $r\\gg r_0$, reducing it by a factor $1-\\mathcal{O}\\!\\left((r_0/r)^{2}\\right)$ compared to the Volterra solution.\n\nThis statement is incorrect for two reasons. First, the term \"necessarily\" is false. For a screw dislocation, the stress field $\\sigma_{\\theta z} = \\mu b / (2\\pi r)$ generates zero traction on a cylindrical surface $r=\\text{constant}$, since the traction vector $\\mathbf{t} = \\boldsymbol{\\sigma} \\cdot \\mathbf{e}_r$ is identically zero. Thus, removing the core and treating $r=r_0$ as a free surface requires no modification of the Volterra stress field. Second, for an edge dislocation, a free surface at $r=r_0$ does require an image stress field to cancel the tractions. However, the image stresses required to cancel tractions of order $1/r_0$ at the core boundary produce a field that decays as $\\mathcal{O}(r^{-2})$ at large $r$. The total field is $\\sigma_{\\text{total}} = \\sigma_{\\text{Volterra}} + \\sigma_{\\text{image}} \\sim \\mathcal{O}(r^{-1}) + \\mathcal{O}(r^{-2})$. The relative correction is therefore of order $\\mathcal{O}(r_0/r)$, not $\\mathcal{O}((r_0/r)^2)$ as stated. Verdict: **Incorrect**.\n\nC. For a screw dislocation, the same procedure gives\n$$\n\\frac{U_{\\text{screw}}}{L}=\\frac{\\mu\\,b^{2}}{4\\pi}\\ln\\frac{R}{r_0}+C'_{\\text{core}},\n$$\nthat is, the logarithmic prefactor is independent of $\\nu$.\n\nThis statement is correct. Integrating the energy density for a screw dislocation gives:\n$$ \\frac{U_{\\text{screw}}}{L} = \\int_{r_0}^{R} \\left(\\frac{\\mu b^2}{8\\pi^2 r^2}\\right) 2\\pi r \\, dr = \\frac{\\mu b^2}{4\\pi} \\int_{r_0}^{R} \\frac{1}{r} \\, dr = \\frac{\\mu b^2}{4\\pi} \\ln\\frac{R}{r_0} $$\nThis is the elastic energy in the annulus. The expression in the statement correctly identifies this term and adds a core energy constant $C'_{\\text{core}}$. As the governing equations for anti-plane shear in an isotropic medium do not involve $\\nu$, the resulting energy prefactor is indeed independent of the Poisson's ratio. Verdict: **Correct**.\n\nD. Because the Burgers circuit cannot pass through the nonlinear core, the Burgers vector measured on any loop of radius $r>r_0$ becomes $b\\left(1-r_0/R\\right)$ rather than $b$.\n\nThis statement is profoundly incorrect. The Burgers vector $\\mathbf{b}$ is a topological charge, defined by the closure failure of a path in the crystal, $\\mathbf{b} = \\oint_C d\\mathbf{u}$. As long as the integration path $C$ encloses the dislocation line, the result of the integral is invariant. It is a fundamental property of the defect and does not depend on the specific path taken in the elastic region. The value of $\\mathbf{b}$ is quantized by the crystal lattice and is constant for a given dislocation. The expression $b(1-r_0/R)$ is nonsensical, as it would imply the Burgers vector depends on both the path of measurement and the outer system size $R$. Verdict: **Incorrect**.\n\nE. Near the core, the elastic energy density scales as $1/r^{2}$; therefore, cutting off the integral at $r=r_0$ changes the small-$r$ divergence of the energy per unit length from a $1/r_0$ divergence to a logarithmic divergence.\n\nThis statement is incorrect. The first part is correct: stress and strain scale as $1/r$, so the energy density $w \\sim \\sigma\\varepsilon$ scales as $1/r^2$. However, the conclusion is based on a false premise. The energy per unit length, $U/L$, is an integral of $w$ over an area element $dA = r dr d\\theta$. Its dependence on radius is thus $\\int w \\cdot r dr \\sim \\int (1/r^2) \\cdot r dr = \\int (1/r) dr$. This integral diverges logarithmically, not as $1/r$, as the lower limit of integration approaches zero. The divergence predicted by the pure elastic model is $\\ln(r_0)$, a logarithmic divergence. The statement incorrectly claims the divergence would be $1/r_0$, which would arise from an energy density scaling as $1/r^3$. The cutoff at $r_0$ does not *change* the nature of the mathematical divergence; it simply provides a finite value for the integral, a value that depends on $\\ln(r_0)$. Verdict: **Incorrect**.\n\nF. The introduction of a core cutoff radius leaves the Peach–Koehler (PK) force per unit length $\\mathbf{f}=\\mathbf{b}\\times(\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}\\cdot\\boldsymbol{\\xi})$ on the dislocation due to a uniform remote stress unchanged, because it depends only on the far-field stress $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}$ and the line direction $\\boldsymbol{\\xi}$.\n\nThis statement is correct. The Peach-Koehler force describes the force exerted on a dislocation by an *external* stress field $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}$ (in this case, a uniform remote stress). This force is fundamentally a measure of the interaction energy between the dislocation and the external field. The core cutoff radius $r_0$ is a parameter introduced to regularize the dislocation's *self-energy*, which is an internal property. The interaction of the dislocation as a whole with a smoothly varying external field is determined by its macroscopic properties: its Burgers vector $\\mathbf{b}$ and line sense vector $\\boldsymbol{\\xi}$. The details of the core structure do not influence this force, in the same way that the detailed charge distribution inside a proton does not affect its trajectory in a large-scale electric field. The PK formula correctly captures this, and its validity is independent of the core regularization scheme.

It does not violate any of the specified invalidity criteria.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. A full solution will be provided.\n\nThe derivation proceeds as follows. A straight mixed dislocation with line direction $\\mathbf{t}$ and Burgers vector $\\mathbf{b}$ can be decomposed into a pure screw component and a pure edge component. The Burgers vector of the screw component, $\\mathbf{b}_s$, is the projection of $\\mathbf{b}$ onto $\\mathbf{t}$, and its magnitude is $b_s = b \\cos\\theta$. The Burgers vector of the edge component, $\\mathbf{b}_e$, is perpendicular to $\\mathbf{t}$, and its magnitude is $b_e = b \\sin\\theta$.\n\nIn linear elasticity, the principle of superposition applies to the displacement, strain, and stress fields. The total field is the sum of the fields from the screw and edge components. For a straight dislocation, the stress field of the screw component and the strain field of the edge component are orthogonal, meaning their product, summed over all indices, is zero: $\\sigma_{ij}^s \\varepsilon_{ij}^e = 0$. Consequently, the interaction energy term vanishes, and the total elastic energy per unit length, $E$, is the direct sum of the energy per unit length of the screw component, $E_s$, and the edge component, $E_e$.\n$$E = E_s + E_e$$\n\nFirst, we calculate the energy of the screw component, $E_s$. A pure screw dislocation with Burgers vector magnitude $b_s$ has only one non-zero stress component in a cylindrical coordinate system $(r, \\phi, z)$ where the $z$-axis aligns with $\\mathbf{t}$.\n$$\\sigma_{z\\phi} = \\sigma_{\\phi z} = \\frac{G b_s}{2 \\pi r}$$\nThe strain energy density $w_s$ is given by $w_s = \\sigma_{z\\phi}^2 / (2G)$. Substituting the expression for the stress:\n$$w_s = \\frac{1}{2G} \\left( \\frac{G b_s}{2 \\pi r} \\right)^2 = \\frac{G b_s^2}{8 \\pi^2 r^2}$$\nTo find the energy per unit length $E_s$, we integrate $w_s$ over the cross-sectional area of the hollow cylinder from the core radius $r_0$ to the outer cutoff radius $R$.\n$$E_s = \\int_{r_0}^{R} \\int_{0}^{2\\pi} w_s(r) \\, r \\, d\\phi \\, dr = \\int_{r_0}^{R} 2\\pi r \\left( \\frac{G b_s^2}{8 \\pi^2 r^2} \\right) dr$$\n$$E_s = \\frac{G b_s^2}{4 \\pi} \\int_{r_0}^{R} \\frac{dr}{r} = \\frac{G b_s^2}{4 \\pi} \\left[ \\ln(r) \\right]_{r_0}^{R} = \\frac{G b_s^2}{4 \\pi} \\ln\\left(\\frac{R}{r_0}\\right)$$\nSubstituting $b_s = b \\cos\\theta$, the energy of the screw component is:\n$$E_s = \\frac{G b^2 \\cos^2(\\theta)}{4 \\pi} \\ln\\left(\\frac{R}{r_0}\\right)$$\nIt is critical to observe that this expression for the screw dislocation energy is independent of Poisson's ratio, $\\nu$. This is because a pure screw dislocation only generates pure shear strains, and the material's response to pure shear in an isotropic medium is governed solely by the shear modulus $G$.\n\nNext, we calculate the energy of the edge component, $E_e$. For a pure edge dislocation with Burgers vector magnitude $b_e$, the stress field involves both normal and shear components and depends on both $G$ and $\\nu$ under the assumption of plane strain, which is appropriate for a long, straight dislocation. The energy per unit length for an edge dislocation is a standard result:\n$$E_e = \\frac{G b_e^2}{4 \\pi (1-\\nu)} \\ln\\left(\\frac{R}{r_0}\\right)$$\nSubstituting $b_e = b \\sin\\theta$, the energy of the edge component is:\n$$E_e = \\frac{G b^2 \\sin^2(\\theta)}{4 \\pi (1-\\nu)} \\ln\\left(\\frac{R}{r_0}\\right)$$\nIn contrast to the screw component, the energy of the edge component is dependent on Poisson's ratio $\\nu$ through the factor $(1-\\nu)$ in the denominator. This dependence arises because an edge dislocation creates regions of both compression and tension, thus involving volumetric changes in strain. The material's resistance to such changes is related to its bulk modulus, which is a function of both $G$ and $\\nu$.\n\nFinally, the total elastic energy per unit length, $E$, is the sum $E_s+E_e$.\n$$E = E_s + E_e = \\frac{G b^2 \\cos^2(\\theta)}{4 \\pi} \\ln\\left(\\frac{R}{r_0}\\right) + \\frac{G b^2 \\sin^2(\\theta)}{4 \\pi (1-\\nu)} \\ln\\left(\\frac{R}{r_0}\\right)$$\nFactoring out the common terms yields the final closed-form expression for the total energy per unit length of the mixed dislocation.\n$$E = \\frac{G b^2}{4 \\pi} \\ln\\left(\\frac{R}{r_0}\\right) \\left( \\cos^2(\\theta) + \\frac{\\sin^2(\\theta)}{1-\\nu} \\right)$$\nThis expression correctly reduces to the pure screw case ($E_s$) for $\\theta=0$ and to the pure edge case ($E_e$) for $\\theta=\\pi/2$.

The normal to this glide plane, $\\mathbf{n}_{\\text{glide}}$, is therefore perpendicular to both $\\mathbf{L}$ and $\\mathbf{b}_{\\mathrm{L}}$, and can be found by their cross product.\n\nWe have the line direction $\\mathbf{L} = [1\\,\\,0\\,\\,-1]$ and the Burgers vector direction, from $\\mathbf{b}_{\\mathrm{L}} = \\frac{a}{2}[1\\,\\,0\\,\\,1]$, is $\\mathbf{b}_{\\mathrm{L, dir}} = [1\\,\\,0\\,\\,1]$.\n$$\n\\mathbf{n}_{\\text{glide}} \\propto \\mathbf{L} \\times \\mathbf{b}_{\\mathrm{L, dir}} = \\begin{vmatrix} \\mathbf{i} & \\mathbf{j} & \\mathbf{k} \\\\ 1 & 0 & -1 \\\\ 1 & 0 & 1 \\end{vmatrix}\n$$\n$$\n\\mathbf{n}_{\\text{glide}} \\propto (0 \\cdot 1 - (-1) \\cdot 0)\\mathbf{i} - (1 \\cdot 1 - (-1) \\cdot 1)\\mathbf{j} + (1 \\cdot 0 - 0 \\cdot 1)\\mathbf{k}\n$$\n$$\n\\mathbf{n}_{\\text{glide}} \\propto 0\\mathbf{i} - 2\\mathbf{j} + 0\\mathbf{k} = [0\\,\\,-2\\,\\,0]\n$$\nThe normal vector is in the $[0\\,\\,-1\\,\\,0]$ direction, which corresponds to the crystallographic plane $(010)$.\nIn FCC crystals, the primary slip planes, those on which dislocation glide is easiest, are the close-packed $\\{111\\}$ planes. The plane $(010)$ is a plane of the $\\{100\\}$ family. Slip on $\\{100\\}$ planes in FCC materials requires a much higher stress than slip on $\\{111\\}$ planes and does not typically occur under normal conditions.\nSince the only plane on which the product dislocation can glide is the $(010)$ plane, and this is not a favorable slip plane, the dislocation is effectively immobile with respect to glide. It is therefore sessile. This immobility is the reason it is called a \"lock,\" as it acts as a strong barrier to the motion of other dislocations.\n\n3) Computation of the magnitude $|\\mathbf{b}_{\\mathrm{L}}|$ and the ratio $|\\mathbf{b}_{\\mathrm{L}}|/a$.\n\nThe Burgers vector of the product dislocation is $\\mathbf{b}_{\\mathrm{L}} = \\frac{a}{2}[1\\,\\,0\\,\\,1]$. Its magnitude is calculated using the standard formula for a vector's Euclidean norm.\n$$\n\\left|\\mathbf{b}_{\\mathrm{L}}\\right| = \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{a}{2} \\cdot 1\\right)^2 + \\left(\\frac{a}{2} \\cdot 0\\right)^2 + \\left(\\frac{a}{2} \\cdot 1\\right)^2}\n$$\n$$\n\\left|\\mathbf{b}_{\\mathrm{L}}\\right| = \\sqrt{\\frac{a^2}{4} + 0 + \\frac{a^2}{4}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{2a^2}{4}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a^2}{2}}\n$$\n$$\n\\left|\\mathbf{b}_{\\mathrm{L}}\\right| = \\frac{a}{\\sqrt{2}} = \\frac{a\\sqrt{2}}{2}\n$$\nThe problem asks for the single number representing the ratio $\\left|\\mathbf{b}_{\\mathrm{L}}\\right|/a$.\n$$\n\\frac{\\left|\\mathbf{b}_{\\mathrm{L}}\\right|}{a} = \\frac{1}{a} \\left(\\frac{a\\sqrt{2}}{2}\\right) = \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}\n$$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}}$$", "id": "2878736"}]}
