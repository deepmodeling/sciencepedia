It is a well-posed problem in the field of materials mechanics, specifically concerning dislocation-mediated plasticity and size effects at the micro-scale. The problem is scientifically grounded in the theory of dislocations, is self-contained, and objective.\n\nThe task is to derive the axial yield stress $\\sigma_y$ of a single-crystal micro-pillar of diameter $D$. The mechanism controlling yield is the operation of a single Frank-Read source, the length of which is limited by the pillar's geometry.\n\nWe begin with the fundamental force balance on a dislocation line. An applied resolved shear stress $\\tau$ exerts a force per unit length on a dislocation, given by the Peach-Koehler relation:\n$$ f_{\\tau} = \\tau b $$\nwhere $b$ is the magnitude of the Burgers vector. This force causes the dislocation line to bow out. The curvature of the dislocation line induces a restoring force due to the dislocation's line tension, $T_d$. For a segment with a radius of curvature $R$, this restoring force per unit length is:\n$$ f_{T} = \\frac{T_d}{R} $$\nAt mechanical equilibrium, these two forces must be equal:\n$$ \\tau b = \\frac{T_d}{R} $$\nA Frank-Read source is a segment of a dislocation line of length $L$ that is pinned at its ends. Under the applied stress $\\tau$, this segment bows out. The radius of curvature $R$ continuously decreases as the bow-out increases. The maximum stress is required when the radius of curvature reaches its minimum value. This critical configuration is a semicircle, for which the radius of curvature is $R_{min} = L/2$. The stress required to achieve this configuration is the critical resolved shear stress, $\\tau_{CRSS}$.\n\nSubstituting $R = L/2$ and $\\tau = \\tau_{CRSS}$ into the force balance equation, we have:\n$$ \\tau_{CRSS} b = \\frac{T_d}{L/2} $$\nSolving for $\\tau_{CRSS}$ gives:\n$$ \\tau_{CRSS} = \\frac{2 T_d}{bL} $$\nThe problem stipulates that we may use only the shear modulus $G$ and the Burgers vector magnitude $b$ as material constants. The line tension $T_d$ represents the energy per unit length of the dislocation line.

The relationship is assumed to follow a power law of the form $\\Delta\\sigma \\propto D^n$. The exponent $n$ is determined from the experimental data and compared to the theoretical exponents predicted by each mechanism.\n\n**Theoretical Scaling Exponents**\n\n1.  **Mechanism S (Source Limitation)**\n    The stress required to operate a dislocation source, such as bowing out a pinned dislocation segment of length $L$, is inversely proportional to that length. The critical resolved shear stress $\\tau_c$ scales as $\\tau_c \\propto \\frac{Gb}{L}$, where $G$ is the shear modulus and $b$ is the Burgers vector magnitude. In this mechanism, the operative source length $L$ is limited by the pillar diameter, so $L \\propto D$. Since the Schmid factor is constant, the applied yield stress $\\sigma_y$ is proportional to $\\tau_c$. The size-dependent contribution to stress, $\\Delta\\sigma_S$, therefore scales as:\n    $$ \\Delta\\sigma_S \\propto \\frac{1}{D} = D^{-1} $$\n    The predicted scaling exponent for Mechanism S is $n_S = -1$.\n\n2.  **Mechanism F (Forest Hardening with Pillar-Limited Slip Distance)**\n    This mechanism assumes Taylor hardening, where the stress increase is related to the dislocation density $\\rho$ by $\\Delta\\sigma_F \\propto \\sqrt{\\rho}$. The evolution of statistically stored dislocations with plastic strain $\\epsilon_p$ is described by $\\frac{d\\rho}{d\\epsilon_p} \\propto \\frac{1}{b\\Lambda}$, where $\\Lambda$ is the dislocation mean free path. Here, $\\Lambda$ is limited by the pillar diameter, so $\\Lambda \\propto D$. For a small, fixed plastic strain (e.g., $0.2\\% = 0.002$), the dislocation density at yield is $\\rho \\propto \\frac{\\epsilon_p}{bD} \\propto \\frac{1}{D}$. Substituting this into the Taylor relation gives the scaling for the size-dependent stress contribution:\n    $$ \\Delta\\sigma_F \\propto \\sqrt{\\rho} \\propto \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{D}} = D^{-1/2} $$\n    The predicted scaling exponent for Mechanism F is $n_F = -0.5$.\n\n**Analysis of Experimental Data**\n\nThe power law $\\Delta\\sigma = C D^n$ can be linearized by taking the logarithm of both sides:\n$$ \\ln(\\Delta\\sigma) = n \\ln(D) + \\ln(C) $$\nThis is the equation of a line where the slope is the scaling exponent $n$.
