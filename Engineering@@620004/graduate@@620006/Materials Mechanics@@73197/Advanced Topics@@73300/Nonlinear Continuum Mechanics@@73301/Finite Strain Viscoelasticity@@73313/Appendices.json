However, for the upper-convected Maxwell model, a rigorous application of this constraint leads to a contradiction, specifically that the shear stress must be zero.

At time $t_{n+1}$, the constitutive law is evaluated as:\n$$\np_{n+1} = K\\,\\varepsilon_{v, n+1} + \\zeta\\,\\dot{\\varepsilon}_{v, n+1}\n$$\nThe backward Euler approximation for the rate term is:\n$$\n\\dot{\\varepsilon}_{v, n+1} \\approx \\frac{\\varepsilon_{v, n+1} - \\varepsilon_{v, n}}{\\Delta t}\n$$\nSubstituting this into the constitutive equation gives the discrete update formula for the pressure:\n$$\np_{n+1} = K\\,\\varepsilon_{v, n+1} + \\zeta \\left( \\frac{\\varepsilon_{v, n+1} - \\varepsilon_{v, n}}{\\Delta t} \\right)\n$$\nRearranging the terms, we express $p_{n+1}$ as a function of the strains at the current and previous time steps:\n$$\np_{n+1} = \\left( K + \\frac{\\zeta}{\\Delta t} \\right) \\varepsilon_{v, n+1} - \\frac{\\zeta}{\\Delta t} \\varepsilon_{v, n}\n$$\nThe algorithmic tangent bulk modulus, denoted $K_{\\text{alg}}$, is required for the tangent stiffness matrix in a Newton-Raphson iterative solver. It is defined as the derivative of the pressure at the end of the step, $p_{n+1}$, with respect to the volumetric strain at the end of the step, $\\varepsilon_{v, n+1}$, holding all history variables (i.e., $\\varepsilon_{v, n}$) constant.\n$$\nK_{\\text{alg}} = \\frac{\\mathrm{d}p_{n+1}}{\\mathrm{d}\\varepsilon_{v, n+1}}\n$$\nPerforming the differentiation on the discrete pressure update formula:\n$$\nK_{\\text{alg}} = \\frac{\\mathrm{d}}{\\mathrm{d}\\varepsilon_{v, n+1}} \\left[ \\left( K + \\frac{\\zeta}{\\Delta t} \\right) \\varepsilon_{v, n+1} - \\frac{\\zeta}{\\Delta t} \\varepsilon_{v, n} \\right] = K + \\frac{\\zeta}{\\Delta t}\n$$\nThis is the consistent tangent bulk modulus for the specified model and time integration scheme.\n\n**2. Derivation of the Effective Poisson's Ratio ($\\nu_{\\text{eff}}$)**\n\nThe problem states that the deviatoric response is rate-independent with shear modulus $G$. Thus, the algorithmic shear modulus is simply $G_{\\text{alg}} = G$. The algorithmic tangent is assumed to be isotropic. For an isotropic material, the bulk modulus $K$, shear modulus $G$, and Poisson's ratio $\\nu$ are related by:\n$$\nK = \\frac{2G(1+\\nu)}{3(1-2\\nu)}\n$$\nWe can define an effective Poisson's ratio, $\\nu_{\\text{eff}}$, for the incremental step based on the algorithmic moduli $K_{\\text{alg}}$ and $G_{\\text{alg}} = G$:\n$$\nK_{\\text{alg}} = \\frac{2G(1+\\nu_{\\text{eff}})}{3(1-2\\nu_{\\text{eff}})}\n$$\nSolving for $\\nu_{\\text{eff}}$ yields the standard relation:\n$$\n\\nu_{\\text{eff}} = \\frac{3K_{\\text{alg}} - 2G}{6K_{\\text{alg}} + 2G}\n$$\nSubstituting the derived expression for $K_{\\text{alg}}$:\n$$\n\\nu_{\\text{eff}} = \\frac{3(K + \\zeta/\\Delta t) - 2G}{6(K + \\zeta/\\Delta t) + 2G}\n$$\nConsider the limit as the time step $\\Delta t$ approaches zero. The term $\\zeta/\\Delta t$ approaches infinity, causing $K_{\\text{alg}}$ to approach infinity.\n$$\n\\lim_{\\Delta t \\to 0} \\nu_{\\text{eff}} = \\lim_{K_{\\text{alg}} \\to \\infty} \\frac{3K_{\\text{alg}} - 2G}{6K_{\\text{alg}} + 2G} = \\lim_{K_{\\text{alg}} \\to \\infty} \\frac{3 - 2G/K_{\\text{alg}}}{6 + 2G/K_{\\text{alg}}} = \\frac{3}{6} = \\frac{1}{2}\n$$\nA value of $\\nu_{\\text{eff}} = 1/2$ corresponds to perfect incompressibility for the incremental step.\n\nUsing the given numerical values: $K = 2\\,\\mathrm{GPa}$, $G = 1\\,\\mathrm{GPa}$, $\\zeta = 100\\,\\mathrm{GPa}\\cdot\\mathrm{s}$, and $\\Delta t = 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{s}$.\nFirst, we compute the algorithmic bulk modulus:\n$$\nK_{\\text{alg}} = 2\\,\\mathrm{GPa} + \\frac{100\\,\\mathrm{GPa}\\cdot\\mathrm{s}}{10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{s}} = 2\\,\\mathrm{GPa} + 100000\\,\\mathrm{GPa} = 100002\\,\\mathrm{GPa}\n$$\nNow, we compute the effective Poisson's ratio:\n$$\n\\nu_{\\text{eff}} = \\frac{3(100002\\,\\mathrm{GPa}) - 2(1\\,\\mathrm{GPa})}{6(100002\\,\\mathrm{GPa}) + 2(1\\,\\mathrm{GPa})} = \\frac{300006 - 2}{600012 + 2} = \\frac{300004}{600014} \\approx 0.499995\n$$\nThis value is extremely close to $1/2$, confirming the analytical limit.\n\n**3. Evaluation of Options**\n\n**A. With the Kelvin–Voigt volumetric law and backward Euler, the discrete algorithmic bulk modulus becomes $K + \\zeta/\\Delta t$, which can drive $\\nu_{\\text{eff}} \\to 1/2$ as $\\Delta t \\to 0$, causing severe volumetric locking in fully integrated low-order displacement elements.**\nThis statement is consistent with our derivations. The formula for the algorithmic bulk modulus $K_{\\text{alg}} = K + \\zeta/\\Delta t$ is correct. The conclusion that $\\nu_{\\text{eff}} \\to 1/2$ as $\\Delta t \\to 0$ is also correct. An effective Poisson's ratio approaching $1/2$ signifies a nearly incompressible response for the increment. In fully integrated low-order displacement-based elements (like the specified trilinear hexahedra), this leads to an over-constraining of the element's kinematic degrees of freedom, a phenomenon known as volumetric locking. The element becomes excessively stiff and produces non-physical, oscillating pressure fields under (nearly) isochoric deformations. Therefore, the statement is entirely correct.\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\n**B. The discrete algorithmic bulk modulus is $K/(1 + K\\,\\Delta t/\\zeta)$, so $\\nu_{\\text{eff}}$ decreases as $\\Delta t \\to 0$, alleviating volumetric locking.**\nThis statement provides an incorrect formula for the algorithmic bulk modulus. The expression $K_{\\text{alg}} = K/(1 + K\\,\\Delta t/\\zeta)$ is what one would derive for a Maxwell model (an elastic spring and a viscous dashpot in series) under backward Euler integration, not a Kelvin-Voigt model (spring and dashpot in parallel). Since the foundational premise of the statement is incorrect, its conclusions are invalid.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**C. Introducing an independent pressure field in a displacement–pressure mixed formulation and satisfying the Ladyzhenskaya–Babuška–Brezzi (LBB) condition removes volumetric locking regardless of the magnitude of the algorithmic bulk modulus.**\nThis statement correctly describes a standard and robust remedy for volumetric locking. A displacement-pressure (u-p) mixed formulation treats pressure as an independent field of unknowns, rather than deriving it directly from the volumetric part of the strain. This avoids the kinematic over-constraint. The Ladyzhenskaya–Babuška–Brezzi (LBB) condition, also known as the inf-sup condition, is the mathematical requirement on the choice of interpolation functions for displacement and pressure that guarantees the stability and well-posedness of the mixed problem. A stable mixed formulation is designed specifically to handle the incompressible limit, where the bulk modulus effectively tends to infinity. It therefore provides a solution free of locking, regardless of how large $K_{\\text{alg}}$ becomes.\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\n**D. Locking can be mitigated by selectively treating the volumetric part, such as using a $B\\text{-}\\bar$ methodology or selective reduced integration for the volumetric strain, or by keeping the viscous bulk term out of the tangent stiffness (selective relaxation) while retaining it in the stress update.**\nThis option lists several techniques.\n- The $B\\text{-}\\bar$ methodology involves replacing the kinematic strain-displacement matrix $B$ with a modified version $\\bar{B}$ for the volumetric terms, typically by projecting the volumetric strain onto a lower-order polynomial space.\n- Selective Reduced Integration (SRI) uses a lower-order quadrature rule to compute the contribution of the volumetric terms to the element stiffness matrix.\nBoth $B\\text{-}\\bar$ and SRI are well-established, effective methods for alleviating volumetric locking in low-order elements. They work by reducing the number of volumetric constraints at the element integration points.\n- The final suggestion, \"keeping the viscous bulk term out of the tangent stiffness\", is a numerical strategy to improve the convergence of the nonlinear solver. The resulting tangent is no longer consistent, leading to a loss of quadratic convergence rate, but it can help solve the highly stiff system of equations that arises from a large $K_{\\text{alg}}$. However, this technique does not in itself \"remedy\" or \"mitigate\" the locking phenomenon; the converged solution would still be a locked one. Nevertheless, since the statement is a disjunction (\"or\"), and the first two proposed methods ($B\\text{-}\\bar$ and SRI) are indeed valid remedies for locking, the statement as a whole is logically correct.\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\n**E. Reducing the shear viscosity while keeping the bulk viscosity large will prevent volumetric locking because locking is governed by the deviatoric stiffness rather than the volumetric stiffness.**\nThis statement is fundamentally flawed. First, the problem explicitly states that the \"deviatoric response is taken as rate-independent,\" which means there is no shear viscosity in the model to reduce. The statement introduces a parameter that does not exist in the problem definition. Second, and more critically, it asserts that \"locking is governed by the deviatoric stiffness rather than the volumetric stiffness.\" This is false. **Volumetric** locking is a direct consequence of an overly stiff **volumetric** response, i.e., a very large bulk modulus $K$ (or $K_{\\text{alg}}$). Deviatoric stiffness governs the response to shape changes, not volume changes.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{ACD}$$", "id": "2887010"}]}
