It presents a standard exercise in linear elasticity theory, which is a fundamental part of continuum mechanics. All terms are defined conventionally, and the objectives are clear and achievable using established principles. Therefore, we proceed with the solution.\n\nThe strain energy density $W$ for a linear isotropic hyperelastic material is given as a quadratic function of the infinitesimal strain tensor $\\varepsilon$:\n$$\nW(\\varepsilon) = \\frac{1}{2} \\lambda (\\operatorname{tr}\\varepsilon)^{2} + \\mu \\varepsilon:\\varepsilon\n$$\nwhere $\\lambda$ and $\\mu$ are the Lamé parameters, $\\operatorname{tr}\\varepsilon$ is the trace of $\\varepsilon$, and $\\varepsilon:\\varepsilon = \\varepsilon_{ij}\\varepsilon_{ij}$ is the Frobenius inner product of $\\varepsilon$ with itself. The strain tensor $\\varepsilon$ is symmetric.\n\n1) Derivation of the Cauchy stress $\\sigma$.\n\nThe Cauchy stress tensor $\\sigma$ is work-conjugate to the strain tensor $\\varepsilon$. For a hyperelastic material, this relationship is expressed through the Fréchet derivative of the strain energy density $W$ with respect to $\\varepsilon$. This is formally defined by the first variation of $W$:\n$$\n\\delta W = \\frac{\\partial W}{\\partial \\varepsilon} : \\delta\\varepsilon = \\sigma : \\delta\\varepsilon\n$$\nfor any admissible variation $\\delta\\varepsilon$, which must be a symmetric second-order tensor. We compute the variation of the given $W$:\n$$\n\\delta W = \\delta \\left( \\frac{1}{2} \\lambda (\\operatorname{tr}\\varepsilon)^{2} + \\mu (\\varepsilon:\\varepsilon) \\right)\n$$\nUsing the chain rule and product rule for differentiation:\n$$\n\\delta W = \\frac{1}{2} \\lambda \\cdot 2 (\\operatorname{tr}\\varepsilon) \\cdot \\delta(\\operatorname{tr}\\varepsilon) + \\mu (\\delta\\varepsilon:\\varepsilon + \\varepsilon:\\delta\\varepsilon)\n$$\nGiven the symmetry of $\\varepsilon$ and $\\delta\\varepsilon$, the Frobenius product is commutative, so $\\varepsilon:\\delta\\varepsilon = \\delta\\varepsilon:\\varepsilon$. Also, the trace operator is linear, so $\\delta(\\operatorname{tr}\\varepsilon) = \\operatorname{tr}(\\delta\\varepsilon)$.\n$$\n\\delta W = \\lambda (\\operatorname{tr}\\varepsilon) \\operatorname{tr}(\\delta\\varepsilon) + 2\\mu (\\varepsilon:\\delta\\varepsilon)\n$$\nTo match the form $\\sigma:\\delta\\varepsilon$, we express the trace term as a Frobenius product. The trace can be written as $\\operatorname{tr}(\\delta\\varepsilon) = I:\\delta\\varepsilon$, where $I$ is the second-order identity tensor. Substituting this into the expression for $\\delta W$:\n$$\n\\delta W = \\lambda (\\operatorname{tr}\\varepsilon) (I:\\delta\\varepsilon) + 2\\mu (\\varepsilon:\\delta\\varepsilon)\n$$\nFactoring out the variation $\\delta\\varepsilon$:\n$$\n\\delta W = (\\lambda (\\operatorname{tr}\\varepsilon) I + 2\\mu \\varepsilon) : \\delta\\varepsilon\n$$\nBy comparing this with the definition $\\delta W = \\sigma : \\delta\\varepsilon$, we identify the expression for the Cauchy stress tensor:\n$$\n\\sigma = \\lambda (\\operatorname{tr}\\varepsilon) I + 2 \\mu \\varepsilon\n$$\nIn index notation, this is the familiar Hooke's Law for isotropic materials:\n$$\n\\sigma_{ij} = \\lambda \\varepsilon_{kk} \\delta_{ij} + 2 \\mu \\varepsilon_{ij}\n$$\n\n2) Derivation of the elasticity tensor $\\mathbb{C}$.\n\nThe fourth-order elasticity tensor $\\mathbb{C}$ is defined as the derivative of the stress tensor $\\sigma$ with respect to the strain tensor $\\varepsilon$, which is $\\mathbb{C} = \\frac{\\partial \\sigma}{\\partial \\varepsilon}$. This relationship is defined by the variation of stress: $\\delta\\sigma = \\mathbb{C}:\\delta\\varepsilon$. We compute the variation of the expression for $\\sigma$ derived in the previous step:\n$$\n\\delta\\sigma = \\delta(\\lambda (\\operatorname{tr}\\varepsilon) I + 2 \\mu \\varepsilon)\n$$\nSince $\\lambda$, $\\mu$, and $I$ are constants:\n$$\n\\delta\\sigma = \\lambda \\delta(\\operatorname{tr}\\varepsilon) I + 2 \\mu \\delta\\varepsilon\n$$\nAgain, we write $\\delta(\\operatorname{tr}\\varepsilon) = \\operatorname{tr}(\\delta\\varepsilon) = I:\\delta\\varepsilon$.\n$$\n\\delta\\sigma = \\lambda (I:\\delta\\varepsilon) I + 2 \\mu \\delta\\varepsilon\n$$\nTo find the components $C_{ijkl}$, we rewrite this expression in the form $\\delta\\sigma_{ij} = C_{ijkl} \\delta\\varepsilon_{kl}$. The term $\\lambda (I:\\delta\\varepsilon) I$ can be written using the tensor product $\\otimes$ as $\\lambda I \\otimes I : \\delta\\varepsilon$. The term $2\\mu\\delta\\varepsilon$ can be written as $2\\mu\\mathbb{I}^{\\text{sym}}:\\delta\\varepsilon$, where $\\mathbb{I}^{\\text{sym}}$ is the symmetric fourth-order identity tensor. Its action on a second-order tensor is identity, and its components are $(\\mathbb{I}^{\\text{sym}})_{ijkl} = \\frac{1}{2}(\\delta_{ik}\\delta_{jl} + \\delta_{il}\\delta_{jk})$.\nTherefore, we have:\n$$\n\\delta\\sigma = (\\lambda (I \\otimes I) + 2\\mu \\mathbb{I}^{\\text{sym}}) : \\delta\\varepsilon\n$$\nFrom this, we identify the elasticity tensor $\\mathbb{C} = \\lambda (I \\otimes I) + 2\\mu \\mathbb{I}^{\\text{sym}}$.

This expression correctly possesses the required major ($C_{ijkl} = C_{klij}$) and minor ($C_{ijkl}=C_{jikl}=C_{ijlk}$) symmetries.\n\n3) Conditions for strict positive definiteness of $W(\\varepsilon)$.\n\nThe condition for material stability at the reference state is that the strain energy $W(\\varepsilon)$ must be strictly positive for any non-zero strain, i.e., $W(\\varepsilon)  0$ for all symmetric $\\varepsilon \\neq 0$. This means the quadratic form is positive definite.\n\nTo analyze this, we decompose the strain tensor $\\varepsilon$ into its volumetric (or spherical) part and its deviatoric part:\n$$\n\\varepsilon = \\varepsilon' + \\frac{1}{3}(\\operatorname{tr}\\varepsilon)I\n$$\nwhere $\\varepsilon' = \\varepsilon - \\frac{1}{3}(\\operatorname{tr}\\varepsilon)I$ is the deviatoric strain, which is traceless ($\\operatorname{tr}\\varepsilon' = 0$). The term $\\frac{1}{3}(\\operatorname{tr}\\varepsilon)I$ is the volumetric strain. The two parts are orthogonal under the Frobenius inner product: $\\varepsilon' : ((\\operatorname{tr}\\varepsilon)I) = (\\operatorname{tr}\\varepsilon)(\\varepsilon':I) = (\\operatorname{tr}\\varepsilon)(\\operatorname{tr}\\varepsilon') = 0$.\n\nWe substitute this decomposition into the term $\\varepsilon:\\varepsilon$:\n$$\n\\varepsilon:\\varepsilon = \\left(\\varepsilon' + \\frac{1}{3}(\\operatorname{tr}\\varepsilon)I\\right) : \\left(\\varepsilon' + \\frac{1}{3}(\\operatorname{tr}\\varepsilon)I\\right) = \\varepsilon':\\varepsilon' + \\frac{1}{9}(\\operatorname{tr}\\varepsilon)^2(I:I) = \\varepsilon':\\varepsilon' + \\frac{1}{3}(\\operatorname{tr}\\varepsilon)^2\n$$\nsince $I:I = \\delta_{ij}\\delta_{ij} = \\delta_{ii} = 3$.\n\nNow we rewrite the strain energy $W$ using this decomposition:\n$$\nW(\\varepsilon) = \\frac{1}{2} \\lambda (\\operatorname{tr}\\varepsilon)^2 + \\mu \\left( \\varepsilon':\\varepsilon' + \\frac{1}{3}(\\operatorname{tr}\\varepsilon)^2 \\right)\n$$\n$$\nW(\\varepsilon) = \\left( \\frac{\\lambda}{2} + \\frac{\\mu}{3} \\right) (\\operatorname{tr}\\varepsilon)^2 + \\mu (\\varepsilon':\\varepsilon')\n$$\nThis can be written in terms of the bulk modulus $K = \\lambda + \\frac{2}{3}\\mu$ and shear modulus $G = \\mu$:\n$$\nW(\\varepsilon) = \\frac{1}{2} K (\\operatorname{tr}\\varepsilon)^2 + \\mu (\\varepsilon':\\varepsilon')\n$$\nFor $W(\\varepsilon)$ to be strictly positive for any non-zero symmetric tensor $\\varepsilon \\neq 0$, we consider two independent cases:\na) Purely deviatoric strain: $\\operatorname{tr}\\varepsilon = 0$, so $\\varepsilon = \\varepsilon' \\neq 0$. In this case, $W = \\mu(\\varepsilon':\\varepsilon')$. Since $\\varepsilon':\\varepsilon'  0$ for $\\varepsilon' \\neq 0$, we require $\\mu  0$.\nb) Purely volumetric strain: $\\varepsilon' = 0$, so $\\varepsilon = \\frac{1}{3}(\\operatorname{tr}\\varepsilon)I$ with $\\operatorname{tr}\\varepsilon \\neq 0$. In this case, $W = \\frac{1}{2} K (\\operatorname{tr}\\varepsilon)^2$. Since $(\\operatorname{tr}\\varepsilon)^2  0$, we require $K  0$.\n\nThus, the conditions for strict positive definiteness are:\n$$\n\\mu > 0 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad K = \\lambda + \\frac{2}{3}\\mu > 0 \\quad \\left( \\text{or } 3\\lambda + 2\\mu > 0 \\right)\n$$\nThese are the classical stability conditions for a linear isotropic elastic material.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\lambda \\delta_{ij} \\delta_{kl} + \\mu (\\delta_{ik} \\delta_{jl} + \\delta_{il} \\delta_{jk})}\n$$", "id": "2900220"}, {"introduction": "Moving from infinitesimal to finite deformations requires a more sophisticated notion of stability, known as strong ellipticity or the Legendre-Hadamard condition.

The squared Frobenius norm $\\|F\\|^2$ is a strictly convex function of $F$. Since $\\mu > 0$, $W_1(F)$ is a strictly convex function of $F$.\n\nThe function $W_2(J)$ depends only on the determinant $J$. To check for its convexity with respect to $J$ for $J > 0$, we compute its second derivative:\n$$\n\\frac{d W_2}{d J} = -\\frac{\\mu}{J} + \\lambda(J-1)\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{d^2 W_2}{d J^2} = \\frac{\\mu}{J^2} + \\lambda\n$$\nGiven that $\\mu > 0$ and $\\lambda > 0$, it is clear that $\\frac{d^2 W_2}{d J^2} > 0$ for all $J > 0$. Thus, $W_2(J)$ is a strictly convex function of $J$.\n\nWe can define a function $g: \\mathbb{R}^{3 \\times 3} \\times \\mathbb{R}^{3 \\times 3} \\times \\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}$ as\n$$\ng(A, B, \\delta) = \\frac{\\mu}{2}\\,\\big(\\operatorname{tr}(A^{T}A) - 3\\big)\\;-\\;\\mu\\,\\ln \\delta \\;+\\; \\frac{\\lambda}{2}\\,(\\delta - 1)^{2}\n$$\nsuch that $W_{\\mathrm{poly}}(F) = g(F, \\operatorname{Cof}F, \\det F)$. This function $g$ is a sum of a convex function of $A$ and a convex function of $\\delta$, and it is independent of $B$. The sum of convex functions is convex. Therefore, $W_{\\mathrm{poly}}$ is a polyconvex function.\n\n**2. Linearization:**\nTo verify that $W_{\\mathrm{poly}}$ corresponds to the Lamé moduli $(\\lambda, \\mu)$ in the small-strain limit, we compute the fourth-order elasticity tensor $\\mathbb{C} = 4 \\frac{\\partial^2 \\widehat{W}}{\\partial C^2}|_{C=I}$, where $\\widehat{W}(C)$ is the energy expressed as a function of the right Cauchy-Green tensor $C = F^T F$. We have\n$$\n\\widehat{W}(C) = \\frac{\\mu}{2}(\\operatorname{tr}(C)-3) - \\frac{\\mu}{2}\\ln(\\det C) + \\frac{\\lambda}{2}(\\sqrt{\\det C}-1)^2\n$$\nThe second Piola-Kirchhoff stress is $S = 2 \\frac{\\partial \\widehat{W}}{\\partial C}$.\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial \\widehat{W}}{\\partial C} = \\frac{\\mu}{2} I - \\frac{\\mu}{2} \\frac{1}{\\det C} (\\det C) C^{-T} + \\lambda(\\sqrt{\\det C}-1) \\frac{1}{2\\sqrt{\\det C}} (\\det C) C^{-T}\n$$\nThis simplifies to:\n$$\nS = 2 \\frac{\\partial \\widehat{W}}{\\partial C} = \\mu I - \\mu C^{-1} + \\lambda(\\det C - \\sqrt{\\det C}) C^{-1}\n$$\nAt the reference configuration $F=I$, we have $C=I$ and $\\det C = 1$, which gives $S(I) = \\mu I - \\mu I + 0 = 0$. The reference state is stress-free.\nThe elasticity tensor components are $\\mathbb{C}_{ijkl} = 2 \\frac{\\partial S_{ij}}{\\partial C_{kl}} |_{C=I}$. Differentiating $S$ with respect to $C$ at $C=I$ yields:\n$$\n\\mathbb{C}_{ijkl} = \\lambda \\delta_{ij}\\delta_{kl} + \\mu(\\delta_{ik}\\delta_{jl} + \\delta_{il}\\delta_{jk})\n$$\nThis is precisely the stiffness tensor for a linear isotropic material with Lamé moduli $\\lambda$ and $\\mu$.\n\n**3. Existence of Minimizers:**\nThe direct method of the calculus of variations establishes the existence of a minimizer for an energy functional $\\mathcal{E}(y) = \\int_{\\Omega} W(\\nabla y) \\,dx$ if the functional is coercive and weakly lower semi-continuous in a suitable function space. A key theorem by John Ball states that if the integrand $W$ is polyconvex and satisfies suitable coercivity (growth) conditions, then the functional $\\mathcal{E}$ is weakly lower semi-continuous.\nFor $W_{\\mathrm{poly}}$, as $\\|F\\| \\to \\infty$, the term $\\frac{\\mu}{2}\\|F\\|^2$ dominates, providing quadratic growth. As $J \\to 0^+$, the term $-\\mu \\ln J \\to \\infty$, penalizing extreme compression. These properties together ensure coercivity. Since $W_{\\mathrm{poly}}$ is polyconvex and coercive, it guarantees the existence of minimizers for the associated variational problem under standard assumptions on boundary data and body forces.\n\n### Analysis of $W_{\\mathrm{SVK}}(F)$\n\nThe Saint Venant–Kirchhoff energy is defined as\n$$\nW_{\\mathrm{SVK}}(F) \\;=\\; \\mu\\,\\operatorname{tr}(E^{2}) \\;+\\; \\frac{\\lambda}{2}\\,\\big(\\operatorname{tr} E\\big)^{2}, \\qquad E \\;=\\; \\frac{1}{2}\\,(C - I)\n$$\nwhere $E$ is the Green-Lagrange strain tensor.\n\n**1. Linearization:**\nIn the limit of small displacements, the deformation gradient is $F = I+H$ with $\\|H\\| \\ll 1$. The Green-Lagrange strain tensor $E$ is related to the infinitesimal strain tensor $\\varepsilon = \\frac{1}{2}(H+H^T)$ by $E = \\varepsilon + O(\\|H\\|^2)$. By substituting $E \\approx \\varepsilon$ into the expression for $W_{\\mathrm{SVK}}$, we immediately recover the standard stored-energy function for linearized isotropic elasticity:\n$$\nW_{\\mathrm{lin}}(\\varepsilon) = \\mu\\,\\operatorname{tr}(\\varepsilon^{2}) \\;+\\; \\frac{\\lambda}{2}\\,\\big(\\operatorname{tr} \\varepsilon\\big)^{2}\n$$\nThus, $W_{\\mathrm{SVK}}$ correctly reproduces the linear elastic response with Lamé moduli $(\\lambda, \\mu)$.\n\n**2. Rank-One Convexity:**\nA function $W$ is rank-one convex at $F$ if the Legendre–Hadamard condition is satisfied, which means the acoustic tensor is positive semi-definite. For small strains, this is equivalent to the positive definiteness of the elasticity tensor $\\mathbb{C}$. The eigenvalues of the acoustic tensor derived from $\\mathbb{C}$ are $\\mu$ and $\\lambda+2\\mu$. Since $\\lambda  0$ and $\\mu  0$, both eigenvalues are strictly positive. Therefore, $W_{\\mathrm{SVK}}$ is rank-one convex at $F=I$ and, by continuity, in a neighborhood of $F=I$.\nHowever, it is a well-established fact that the SVK model is not globally rank-one convex. It loses this property under sufficient compression or shear, which makes it physically and mathematically problematic for large strain analysis.\n\n**3. Polyconvexity and Existence of Minimizers:**\nRank-one convexity is a necessary condition for quasiconvexity, and quasiconvexity is a necessary condition for polyconvexity (for $n \\ge 3$, quasiconvexity does not imply polyconvexity). Since $W_{\\mathrm{SVK}}$ is not globally rank-one convex, it cannot be globally polyconvex. The lack of polyconvexity (and even quasiconvexity) means that the energy functional $\\int W_{\\mathrm{SVK}}(\\nabla y) \\,dx$ is not, in general, weakly lower semi-continuous. Consequently, the direct method of the calculus of variations cannot be applied, and the existence of energy minimizers is not guaranteed for arbitrary (large) boundary data. The failure of existence is related to the formation of microstructures, where minimizing sequences develop infinitely fine oscillations to lower the total energy.\n\n### Evaluation of the Options\n\n**A. $W_{\\mathrm{poly}}$ is polyconvex, frame-indifferent, and its quadratic expansion at $F=I$ yields the linearized isotropic elasticity with Lamé moduli $(\\lambda,\\mu)$. Moreover, under standard Dirichlet boundary conditions and suitable body forces, the energy functional $\\int_{\\Omega} W_{\\mathrm{poly}}(\\nabla y)\\,\\mathrm{d}x$ admits a minimizer in $W^{1,2}$ because of polyconvexity and coercivity.**\nOur analysis confirms every part of this statement. $W_{\\mathrm{poly}}$ is polyconvex, frame-indifferent (as it depends on $C=F^TF$ and $J=\\det F$), correctly linearizes to the specified moduli, and its polyconvexity and coercivity guarantee existence of minimizers.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. $W_{\\mathrm{SVK}}$ has the same small-strain Lamé moduli $(\\lambda,\\mu)$, is rank-one convex only in a neighborhood of $F=I$ provided $\\mu0$ and $\\lambda + 2\\mu  0$, but it is not polyconvex globally and, in general, does not guarantee existence of minimizers under large boundary data due to loss of weak lower semicontinuity.**\nOur analysis confirms all claims in this statement. The linearization is correct by definition. The local rank-one convexity for $\\lambda, \\mu  0$ holds, but this property is lost for large strains. The lack of global polyconvexity (and quasiconvexity) is a known major failing of the SVK model, leading to non-existence of solutions for general boundary value problems.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**C. For isotropic, frame-indifferent materials, polyconvexity and rank-one convexity are equivalent; therefore both $W_{\\mathrm{poly}}$ and $W_{\\mathrm{SVK}}$ guarantee existence of minimizers under the same hypotheses.**\nThis statement is fundamentally incorrect. The convexity conditions for stored energy functions are related by strict implications: Polyconvexity $\\implies$ Quasiconvexity $\\implies$ Rank-one convexity. The reverse implications are false. There exist functions that are rank-one convex but not quasiconvex. The claim of equivalence is false. The conclusion drawn from this false premise is also incorrect, as we have established that $W_{\\mathrm{poly}}$ guarantees existence while $W_{\\mathrm{SVK}}$ does not.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. If $\\lambda$ and $\\mu$ are chosen to match the linear moduli, this necessarily destroys rank-one convexity of $W_{\\mathrm{SVK}}$ already at $F=I$, so even the Legendre–Hadamard condition fails in the infinitesimal limit.**\nThis statement is false. Our analysis showed that for $\\lambda  0$ and $\\mu  0$, the Legendre-Hadamard condition for $W_{\\mathrm{SVK}}$ is strictly satisfied at $F=I$. The eigenvalues of the acoustic tensor, $\\mu$ and $\\lambda+2\\mu$, are both positive. The model is well-behaved for infinitesimal strains. The problems arise at finite strains.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**E. The volumetric penalty $-\\mu \\ln J + \\frac{\\lambda}{2}(J-1)^{2}$ in $W_{\\mathrm{poly}}$ is not convex in $J$, so $W_{\\mathrm{poly}}$ cannot be polyconvex.**\nThis statement is false. We calculated the second derivative of the volumetric part $U(J) = -\\mu \\ln J + \\frac{\\lambda}{2}(J-1)^{2}$ with respect to $J$ and found it to be $U''(J) = \\mu/J^2 + \\lambda$. Since $\\mu  0$ and $\\lambda  0$, this expression is strictly positive for all $J  0$. The volumetric part is strictly convex, which is essential for the polyconvexity of $W_{\\mathrm{poly}}$. The premise is false, and so is the conclusion.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{AB}$$", "id": "2900189"}]}
