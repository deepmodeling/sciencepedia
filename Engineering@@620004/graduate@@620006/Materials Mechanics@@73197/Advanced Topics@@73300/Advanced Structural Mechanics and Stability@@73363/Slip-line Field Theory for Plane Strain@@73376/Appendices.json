The material is rigid, perfectly plastic, in a state of plane strain, and obeys the von Mises yield condition. The solution proceeds by applying the Hencky characteristic relations, which are fundamental to slip-line field theory.\n\nFirst, we establish the theoretical framework. For a rigid, perfectly plastic material satisfying the von Mises yield criterion under plane strain conditions, the state of stress at any point undergoing plastic deformation can be specified by two quantities: the mean stress, $p$, and the orientation of the slip lines. The problem defines the mean stress as $p = -\\frac{\\sigma_{1} + \\sigma_{2}}{2}$, where $\\sigma_{1}$ and $\\sigma_{2}$ are the in-plane principal stresses. The yield criterion in plane strain can be expressed in terms of the constant shear yield stress, $k$, as $\\frac{|\\sigma_{1} - \\sigma_{2}|}{2} = k$.\n\nThe governing equations of equilibrium, when combined with the yield criterion and expressed in terms of $p$ and the slip-line angle $\\phi$, form a system of hyperbolic partial differential equations. The characteristics of this system are the slip lines themselves, denoted as $\\alpha$-lines and $\\beta$-lines. Along these characteristic lines, specific relationships, known as the Hencky relations, must hold.

We are to determine the indentation load using the theory of slip-line fields and compare this with the result from a kinematic analysis.\n\nFirst, we shall establish the state of stress and the corresponding slip-line field orientation at the boundaries of the plastic zone. Let the Cartesian coordinate system have its origin at the center of the punch-solid interface, with the $x$-axis along the interface and the $y$-axis pointing into the solid. The punch occupies the region $y=0$, $|x| \\le a$. The problem states the material obeys the Tresca yield criterion with shear yield stress $k$. The stress components on a plane can be expressed in terms of the mean stress, $p = -(\\sigma_x + \\sigma_y)/2$, and the angle $\\phi$ that the first slip-line direction ($\\alpha$-line) makes with the $x$-axis. The standard relations are:\n$$ \\sigma_x = -p - k \\sin(2\\phi) $$\n$$ \\sigma_y = -p + k \\sin(2\\phi) $$\n$$ \\tau_{xy} = k \\cos(2\\phi) $$\n\nWe establish the boundary conditions based on these relations.\n\n1.  **On the traction-free surface** ($y=0$, $|x|>a$): The boundary conditions are $\\sigma_y = 0$ and $\\tau_{xy} = 0$.\n    From $\\tau_{xy} = k \\cos(2\\phi) = 0$, we find that $2\\phi = \\pm \\pi/2$, which implies $\\phi = \\pm \\pi/4$. We must test these possibilities with the normal stress condition.\n    - If $\\phi=\\pi/4$: The condition $\\sigma_y=0$ becomes $-p + k \\sin(\\pi/2) = -p+k = 0$, which yields $p=k$. This represents a compressive hydrostatic state, which is physically plausible.\n    - If $\\phi=-\\pi/4$: The condition $\\sigma_y=0$ becomes $-p + k \\sin(-\\pi/2) = -p-k = 0$, which yields $p=-k$. This represents a tensile hydrostatic state, which is unlikely.\n    Thus, in the Rankine zone adjacent to the free surface, the state is characterized by a mean stress $p=k$ and a slip-line angle $\\phi=\\pi/4$.\n\n2.  **On the smooth punch surface** ($y=0$, $|x|<a$): The punch is smooth, so the shear stress is zero, $\\tau_{xy}=0$. This again implies $\\phi=\\pm \\pi/4$. The classical slip-line field for this problem consists of a central triangular region under the punch connected to the outer Rankine zones via two symmetric Prandtl fans centered at the punch corners ($x=\\pm a$). The slip-lines must meet the smooth interface at $\\phi=\\pm \\pi/4$. By symmetry and considering the flow, the $\\alpha$-lines rotate from $\\pi/4$ at the free surface to $-\\pi/4$ under the punch.\n    Thus, in the central triangular region beneath the punch, the slip-line angle is $\\phi=-\\pi/4$.\n\nNow, we use Hencky's equations to relate the stress states across the Prandtl fan. The fan connects the region near the free surface, where $(p, \\phi) = (k, \\pi/4)$, to the region under the punch, where $\\phi=-\\pi/4$. Let the mean stress under the punch be $p_{punch}$.\nHencky's first equation states that along an $\\alpha$-slip-line, $p+2k\\phi = \\text{constant}$. This implies that for a finite change across a fan region traversed by an $\\alpha$-line, the change in mean pressure is related to the change in angle by $\\Delta p = -2k \\Delta\\phi$.\nApplying this, we find the mean stress under the punch:\n$$ p_{punch} - p_{free} = -2k (\\phi_{punch} - \\phi_{free}) $$\n$$ p_{punch} - k = -2k (-\\pi/4 - \\pi/4) = -2k(-\\pi/2) = k\\pi $$\n$$ p_{punch} = k(1+\\pi) $$\nThis is the uniform mean stress in the central triangular region under the punch.\n\nNext, we calculate the contact pressure, $p_c$, acting on the punch face. This pressure is the normal stress component $-\\sigma_y$ evaluated at the punch surface. Using the stress relations with the state under the punch ($p=p_{punch}=k(1+\\pi)$ and $\\phi=-\\pi/4$):\n$$ \\sigma_y = -p_{punch} + k \\sin(2\\phi) = -k(1+\\pi) + k \\sin(-\\pi/2) $$\n$$ \\sigma_y = -k(1+\\pi) - k = -k - k\\pi - k = -k(2+\\pi) $$\nThe contact pressure is therefore uniform and given by:\n$$ p_c = -\\sigma_y = k(2+\\pi) $$\n\nTo find the resultant load $P$ per unit thickness, we integrate this pressure over the width of the punch. The punch has a half-width of $a$, so its total width is $2a$.\n$$ P = \\int_{-a}^{a} p_c \\,dx = p_c \\int_{-a}^{a} dx = p_c (2a) $$\nSubstituting the expression for $p_c$:\n$$ P = 2a k(2+\\pi) $$\nThis result is derived from a statically admissible stress field and constitutes a lower bound on the true load.\n\nThe problem then asks for a comparison with the kinematic (upper bound) estimate based on the velocity field associated with the same slip-line geometry. According to the upper bound theorem of plasticity, any load derived from a kinematically admissible velocity field is an upper bound to the true collapse load.\n\nFor the specific slip-line field considered here (the Prandtl field), a corresponding kinematically admissible velocity field exists. The calculation of the upper bound load involves equating the external rate of work, $P_{upper} \\cdot V_{punch}$, to the internal rate of energy dissipation along slip-lines and within the deforming fan regions. For this classical problem, the detailed calculation shows that the load obtained from the kinematic analysis is also $P_{upper} = 2a k(2+\\pi)$.\n\nSince the load from the statically admissible stress field (lower bound) is equal to the load from the kinematically admissible velocity field (upper bound),\n$$ P_{lower} = P_{upper} = 2a k(2+\\pi) $$\nthe slip-line field provides the exact solution for the collapse load under the given idealizations.

In a rigid-perfectly-plastic material at yield under plane strain conditions, the state of stress is described by the mean stress, $p = -\\frac{1}{2}(\\sigma_{xx} + \\sigma_{yy})$, and the constant shear yield stress, $k$.

Analysis of this system shows that along the characteristic directions (the slip-lines), the PDEs reduce to ordinary differential equations, known as Hencky's equations or compatibility relations. For the stress formulation used, these are:\n$$ dp + 2k\\,d\\phi = 0 \\quad (\\text{along an } \\alpha \\text{-line}) $$\n$$ dp - 2k\\,d\\phi = 0 \\quad (\\text{along a } \\beta \\text{-line}) $$\nIn integrated form, these are:\n$$ p + 2k\\phi = C_1 \\quad (\\text{along an } \\alpha \\text{-line}) $$\n$$ p - 2k\\phi = C_2 \\quad (\\text{along a } \\beta \\text{-line}) $$\nThese are the required characteristic equations.\n\nSecond, we use a non-dimensionalization argument. Let us define a normalized pressure $P = p/(2k)$. Hencky's equations become:\n$$ P + \\phi = C_1 / (2k) = C_1^* \\quad (\\text{along an } \\alpha \\text{-line}) $$\n$$ P - \\phi = C_2 / (2k) = C_2^* \\quad (\\text{along a } \\beta \\text{-line}) $$\nThe geometry of the slip-line field is governed by the angles $\\phi$ and the boundary conditions. For Prandtl compression between perfectly rough platens, the slip-lines must meet the platens at $\\pm \\pi/4$. Any stress boundary conditions on free surfaces, for example $p=k$, become $P=1/2$ in normalized form. The entire boundary value problem for the dimensionless fields $P(x/H, y/H)$ and $\\phi(x/H, y/H)$ is independent of the specific values of $H$ and $k$. Consequently, the solution field for the normalized pressure $p/(2k)$ is a universal function of normalized coordinates and does not depend on the magnitude of $k$.\n\nThird, we explain the mapping from uniaxial yield stress $\\sigma_y$ to the shear yield stress $k$. This mapping depends on the chosen yield criterion.\nFor the Tresca criterion, yielding occurs when the maximum shear stress equals $k_T$. In a uniaxial tensile test, the principal stresses are $(\\sigma_y, 0, 0)$, so the maximum shear stress is $\\tau_{\\max} = (\\sigma_y - 0)/2 = \\sigma_y/2$. Therefore, for Tresca:\n$$ k_T = \\frac{\\sigma_y}{2} $$\nFor the von Mises criterion, yielding occurs when the second invariant of the deviatoric stress tensor, $J_2$, reaches a critical value. From a uniaxial test, this value is $J_2 = \\sigma_y^2/3$. The slip-line field theory for a von Mises material under plane strain requires an effective shear yield stress, $k_{VM}$. For plane strain ($\\epsilon_z=0$) with the associated flow rule, one finds $\\sigma_z = (\\sigma_x+\\sigma_y)/2$, where $\\sigma_z$ is the out-of-plane stress. The von Mises criterion $J_2 = \\sigma_y^2/3$ then reduces to $\\frac{1}{4}(\\sigma_1-\\sigma_2)^2 = \\sigma_y^2/3$, where $\\sigma_1, \\sigma_2$ are the in-plane principal stresses. Since the maximum in-plane shear stress is defined as $k = (\\sigma_1-\\sigma_2)/2$, we have $(2k_{VM})^2/4 = \\sigma_y^2/3$, which gives:\n$$ k_{VM} = \\frac{\\sigma_y}{\\sqrt{3}} $$\n\nFinally, we deduce the ratio of the average platen pressures, $\\bar{p}_{\\text{Mises}}/\\bar{p}_{\\text{Tresca}}$.\nThe average pressure $\\bar{p}$ is the total load per unit thickness divided by the contact length. From our non-dimensionalization argument, the normalized average pressure $\\bar{p}/(2k)$ must be a constant, let us call it $C$, that depends only on the geometry of the problem (e.g., aspect ratio of the compressed region) and the boundary conditions (perfectly rough platens). The problem statement specifies the same geometry and boundary conditions for both cases.\n$$ \\frac{\\bar{p}}{2k} = C \\implies \\bar{p} = 2kC $$\nThe constant $C$ is identical for both Tresca and von Mises analyses. Therefore, the average pressures are:\n$$ \\bar{p}_{\\text{Tresca}} = 2k_T C $$\n$$ \\bar{p}_{\\text{Mises}} = 2k_{VM} C $$\nThe ratio is simply the ratio of the respective shear yield stresses:\n$$ \\frac{\\bar{p}_{\\text{Mises}}}{\\bar{p}_{\\text{Tresca}}} = \\frac{2k_{VM}C}{2k_T C} = \\frac{k_{VM}}{k_T} $$\nSubstituting the expressions for $k_T$ and $k_{VM}$ for the same $\\sigma_y$:\n$$ \\frac{\\bar{p}_{\\text{Mises}}}{\\bar{p}_{\\text{Tresca}}} = \\frac{\\sigma_y/\\sqrt{3}}{\\sigma_y/2} = \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{3}} $$\n\nThe physical origin of this discrepancy is that the von Mises and Tresca yield criteria are not identical. In principal stress space, the von Mises cylinder circumscribes the Tresca hexagonal prism. They coincide only for specific stress states like uniaxial or equi-biaxial stress. For general multi-axial stress states, such as those present in plane-strain compression, the von Mises criterion predicts a higher elastic limit. The material is effectively stronger under the von Mises assumption for this stress state, as reflected by $k_{VM} \\approx 0.577\\sigma_y$ being greater than $k_T = 0.5\\sigma_y$.
