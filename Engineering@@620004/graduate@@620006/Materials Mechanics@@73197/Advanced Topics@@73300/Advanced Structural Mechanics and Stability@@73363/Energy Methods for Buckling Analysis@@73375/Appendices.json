The analysis will proceed systematically through the derivation of the total potential energy functional, its first variation, the derivation of the Rayleigh quotient, and finally the evaluation for a specified admissible trial function.\n\nThe total potential energy of the system, denoted by $\\Pi$, is the sum of the internal strain energy of deformation, $U$, and the potential energy of the externally applied load, $V$. The equilibrium configuration of the system is one that renders the total potential energy stationary, which is expressed as $\\delta \\Pi = 0$.\n\nFirst, we derive the expression for the strain energy, $U$. For an Euler-Bernoulli beam, the strain energy is due to bending only. It is given by the integral of one-half the product of the bending moment $M(x)$ and the curvature $\\kappa(x)$ along the length $L$ of the column.\n$$\nU = \\frac{1}{2} \\int_{0}^{L} M(x) \\kappa(x) \\, dx\n$$\nThe constitutive relation for a linearly elastic material is $M(x) = EI \\kappa(x)$, where $E$ is the Young's modulus and $I$ is the second moment of area of the cross-section. For small transverse deflections $w(x)$, the curvature is approximated as $\\kappa(x) \\approx w''(x)$, where primes denote differentiation with respect to the axial coordinate $x$. Substituting these into the expression for $U$ yields:\n$$\nU = \\frac{1}{2} \\int_{0}^{L} EI (w''(x))^{2} \\, dx\n$$\nNext, we derive the potential energy of the external compressive load, $V$. This is given by the negative product of the constant axial force $P$ and the axial shortening of the column, $\\Delta L$, that results from the transverse deflection $w(x)$.\n$$\nV = -P \\Delta L\n$$\nThe elemental arc length $ds$ of the deflected curve is related to the elemental axial length $dx$ by $ds = \\sqrt{1 + (w'(x))^{2}} \\, dx$. The total arc length $S$ is the integral of $ds$ from $x=0$ to $x=L$.\n$$\nS = \\int_{0}^{L} \\sqrt{1 + (w'(x))^{2}} \\, dx\n$$\nThe problem statement specifies the assumption of small slopes, $|w'(x)| \\ll 1$. We may therefore employ a binomial expansion for the square root term: $\\sqrt{1+u} \\approx 1 + \\frac{1}{2} u$ for small $u$. With $u = (w'(x))^{2}$, we have:\n$$\nS \\approx \\int_{0}^{L} \\left(1 + \\frac{1}{2} (w'(x))^{2}\\right) \\, dx = L + \\frac{1}{2} \\int_{0}^{L} (w'(x))^{2} \\, dx\n$$\nThe axial shortening is the difference between the arc length and the original length:\n$$\n\\Delta L = S - L = \\frac{1}{2} \\int_{0}^{L} (w'(x))^{2} \\, dx\n$$\nThus, the potential energy of the external load is:\n$$\nV = -\\frac{P}{2} \\int_{0}^{L} (w'(x))^{2} \\, dx\n$$\nThe total potential energy functional $\\Pi[w]$ is the sum of $U$ and $V$:\n$$\n\\Pi[w] = \\frac{1}{2} \\int_{0}^{L} EI (w''(x))^{2} \\, dx - \\frac{P}{2} \\int_{0}^{L} (w'(x))^{2} \\, dx\n$$\nThis completes the first task. For the second task, we find the stationarity condition by taking the first variation of $\\Pi$ and setting it to zero, $\\delta \\Pi = 0$.\n$$\n\\delta \\Pi = \\delta \\left( \\frac{1}{2} \\int_{0}^{L} \\left[ EI (w'')^{2} - P (w')^{2} \\right] dx \\right) = \\int_{0}^{L} \\left[ EI w'' \\delta(w'') - P w' \\delta(w') \\right] dx = 0\n$$\nRecognizing that the variation and differentiation operators commute, i.e., $\\delta(w') = (\\delta w)'$ and $\\delta(w'') = (\\delta w)''$, we have:\n$$\n\\int_{0}^{L} \\left[ EI w'' (\\delta w)'' - P w' (\\delta w)' \\right] dx = 0\n$$\nWe apply integration by parts to this expression. For the first term:\n$$\n\\int_{0}^{L} EI w'' (\\delta w)'' \\, dx = \\left[ EI w'' (\\delta w)' \\right]_{0}^{L} - \\int_{0}^{L} EI w''' (\\delta w)' \\, dx\n$$\nIntegrating by parts again on the integral term:\n$$\n- \\int_{0}^{L} EI w''' (\\delta w)' \\, dx = - \\left[ EI w''' \\delta w \\right]_{0}^{L} + \\int_{0}^{L} EI w'''' \\delta w \\, dx\n$$\nFor the second term in the variation expression:\n$$\n- \\int_{0}^{L} P w' (\\delta w)' \\, dx = - \\left[ P w' \\delta w \\right]_{0}^{L} + \\int_{0}^{L} P w'' \\delta w \\, dx\n$$\nCombining all terms, the first variation becomes:\n$$\n\\delta \\Pi = \\int_{0}^{L} (EI w'''' + P w'') \\delta w \\, dx + \\left[ EI w'' (\\delta w)' \\right]_{0}^{L} - \\left[ (EI w''' + P w') \\delta w \\right]_{0}^{L} = 0\n$$\nFor this equation to hold for any arbitrary but kinematically admissible variation $\\delta w$, both the integral and the boundary terms must vanish independently. The vanishing of the integral term for any $\\delta w$ in the domain $(0, L)$ yields the governing differential equation (the Euler-Lagrange equation):\n$$\nEI w''''(x) + P w''(x) = 0\n$$\nThe vanishing of the boundary terms provides the boundary conditions of the problem:\n$$\n\\left[ EI w'' (\\delta w)' - (EI w''' + P w') \\delta w \\right]_{x=L} - \\left[ EI w'' (\\delta w)' - (EI w''' + P w') \\delta w \\right]_{x=0} = 0\n$$\nFor a clamped end, the deflection $w$ and the slope $w'$ are prescribed to be zero. These are the **essential** (or geometric) boundary conditions:\n$$\nw(0) = 0, \\quad w'(0) = 0, \\quad w(L) = 0, \\quad w'(L) = 0\n$$\nBecause the deflection and slope are fixed, any admissible variation must also vanish at these points, i.e., $\\delta w(0) = 0$, $\\delta w'(0) = 0$, $\\delta w(L) = 0$, and $\\delta w'(L) = 0$. When these conditions on the variation are enforced, the boundary term in the expression for $\\delta \\Pi$ is identically zero. Therefore, for a problem with clamped ends, any trial function $\\phi(x)$ used in an approximate method like Rayleigh-Ritz **must** satisfy these four essential boundary conditions. The remaining boundary conditions, $EIw'' = 0$ (zero moment) or $EIw'''+Pw' = 0$ (zero effective shear), are called **natural** boundary conditions and are satisfied automatically by the solution if not prescribed.\n\nFor the third task, we use the Rayleigh-Ritz method with a one-term approximation $w(x) = a \\phi(x)$, where $a$ is an unknown amplitude and $\\phi(x)$ is an admissible shape function satisfying the essential boundary conditions. Substituting this into the total potential energy functional gives $\\Pi$ as a function of $a$:\n$$\n\\Pi(a) = \\frac{1}{2} \\int_{0}^{L} EI (a \\phi''(x))^{2} \\, dx - \\frac{P}{2} \\int_{0}^{L} (a \\phi'(x))^{2} \\, dx\n$$\n$$\n\\Pi(a) = \\frac{a^{2}}{2} \\left[ EI \\int_{0}^{L} (\\phi''(x))^{2} \\, dx - P \\int_{0}^{L} (\\phi'(x))^{2} \\, dx \\right]\n$$\nThe stationarity condition becomes $\\frac{d\\Pi}{da} = 0$.\n$$\n\\frac{d\\Pi}{da} = a \\left[ EI \\int_{0}^{L} (\\phi''(x))^{2} \\, dx - P \\int_{0}^{L} (\\phi'(x))^{2} \\, dx \\right] = 0\n$$\nFor a non-trivial buckled solution, $w(x) \\neq 0$, which implies $a \\neq 0$. Therefore, the term in the brackets must be zero. Solving for the load parameter $P$ yields the Rayleigh quotient:\n$$\nP = \\frac{EI \\int_{0}^{L} (\\phi''(x))^{2} \\, dx}{\\int_{0}^{L} (\\phi'(x))^{2} \\, dx}\n$$\nFor the fourth and final task, we evaluate this quotient using the specified shape function $\\phi(x) = 1 - \\cos(\\frac{2\\pi x}{L})$. We have already verified in the validation phase that this function satisfies all four essential boundary conditions for a clamped-clamped column. We compute the required derivatives:\n$$\n\\phi'(x) = \\frac{2\\pi}{L} \\sin\\!\\left(\\frac{2\\pi x}{L}\\right)\n$$\n$$\n\\phi''(x) = \\left(\\frac{2\\pi}{L}\\right)^{2} \\cos\\!\\left(\\frac{2\\pi x}{L}\\right) = \\frac{4\\pi^{2}}{L^{2}} \\cos\\!\\left(\\frac{2\\pi x}{L}\\right)\n$$\nNow, we evaluate the integrals in the numerator and denominator of the Rayleigh quotient.\nThe numerator integral is:\n$$\n\\int_{0}^{L} (\\phi''(x))^{2} \\, dx = \\int_{0}^{L} \\left(\\frac{4\\pi^{2}}{L^{2}}\\right)^{2} \\cos^{2}\\!\\left(\\frac{2\\pi x}{L}\\right) \\, dx = \\frac{16\\pi^{4}}{L^{4}} \\int_{0}^{L} \\cos^{2}\\!\\left(\\frac{2\\pi x}{L}\\right) \\, dx\n$$\nUsing the identity $\\cos^{2}(\\theta) = \\frac{1}{2}(1 + \\cos(2\\theta))$:\n$$\n\\int_{0}^{L} (\\phi''(x))^{2} \\, dx = \\frac{16\\pi^{4}}{L^{4}} \\int_{0}^{L} \\frac{1}{2}\\left(1 + \\cos\\!\\left(\\frac{4\\pi x}{L}\\right)\\right) \\, dx = \\frac{8\\pi^{4}}{L^{4}} \\left[ x + \\frac{L}{4\\pi}\\sin\\!\\left(\\frac{4\\pi x}{L}\\right) \\right]_{0}^{L} = \\frac{8\\pi^{4}}{L^{4}} (L) = \\frac{8\\pi^{4}}{L^{3}}\n$$\nThe denominator integral is:\n$$\n\\int_{0}^{L} (\\phi'(x))^{2} \\, dx = \\int_{0}^{L} \\left(\\frac{2\\pi}{L}\\right)^{2} \\sin^{2}\\!\\left(\\frac{2\\pi x}{L}\\right) \\, dx = \\frac{4\\pi^{2}}{L^{2}} \\int_{0}^{L} \\sin^{2}\\!\\left(\\frac{2\\pi x}{L}\\right) \\, dx\n$$\nUsing the identity $\\sin^{2}(\\theta) = \\frac{1}{2}(1 - \\cos(2\\theta))$:\n$$\n\\int_{0}^{L} (\\phi'(x))^{2} \\, dx = \\frac{4\\pi^{2}}{L^{2}} \\int_{0}^{L} \\frac{1}{2}\\left(1 - \\cos\\!\\left(\\frac{4\\pi x}{L}\\right)\\right) \\, dx = \\frac{2\\pi^{2}}{L^{2}} \\left[ x - \\frac{L}{4\\pi}\\sin\\!\\left(\\frac{4\\pi x}{L}\\right) \\right]_{0}^{L} = \\frac{2\\pi^{2}}{L^{2}} (L) = \\frac{2\\pi^{2}}{L}\n$$\nSubstituting these results back into the Rayleigh quotient for $P$:\n$$\nP = EI \\frac{\\frac{8\\pi^{4}}{L^{3}}}{\\frac{2\\pi^{2}}{L}} = EI \\left(\\frac{8\\pi^{4}}{L^{3}} \\cdot \\frac{L}{2\\pi^{2}}\\right) = \\frac{4\\pi^{2}EI}{L^{2}}\n$$\nThis result is the exact critical load for a clamped-clamped column, which indicates that the chosen trial function $\\phi(x) = 1 - \\cos(2\\pi x/L)$ is, in fact, the true buckling mode shape for the lowest critical load.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\frac{4 \\pi^{2} EI}{L^{2}}}\n$$", "id": "2883663"}, {"introduction": "Building on the fundamental principles, this practice demonstrates the remarkable versatility of the energy method in handling non-classical boundary conditions.

The shear strain is $\\gamma(x)=\\phi(x)-w'(x)$, where the prime denotes differentiation with respect to $x$. Under small strains and small slopes with geometric nonlinearity to second order in $w'(x)$ for the axial shortening, the components of the total potential energy are:\n- Bending strain energy: $U_{b}=\\dfrac{1}{2}\\int_{0}^{L} E I \\left(\\phi'(x)\\right)^{2}\\,\\mathrm{d}x$.\n- Shear strain energy: $U_{s}=\\dfrac{1}{2}\\int_{0}^{L} k G A \\left(\\phi(x)-w'(x)\\right)^{2}\\,\\mathrm{d}x$.\n- Potential of the compressive load: $V_{P}=-P\\,\\delta$, where the end-shortening to second order in the lateral displacement is $\\delta=\\dfrac{1}{2}\\int_{0}^{L}\\left(w'(x)\\right)^{2}\\,\\mathrm{d}x$.\n\nThe total potential energy is $\\Pi=U_{b}+U_{s}+V_{P}$.\n\nFor simply supported ends, the admissible fields must satisfy $w(0)=w(L)=0$ and vanishing bending moment $M(0)=M(L)=0$, where $M=E I \\phi'$.
