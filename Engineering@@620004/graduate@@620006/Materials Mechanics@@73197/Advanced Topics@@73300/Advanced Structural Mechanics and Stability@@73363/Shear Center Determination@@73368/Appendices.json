The beam axis is along $x$, and the cross-section lies in the $y$–$z$ plane. The web midline coincides with $z=0$ and extends from $y=-h/2$ to $y=+h/2$. The flanges lie at $y=\\pm h/2$ and extend from $z=0$ (at the web) to $z=b$ (free tips). The section is symmetric about the horizontal axis $y=0$.\n\nA vertical shear force $V$ acts in the $+y$ direction.

The geometry, loading conditions, and objectives are clearly defined and scientifically sound. All provided information is consistent and sufficient for deriving a unique solution from first principles. Therefore, the problem is deemed valid and a full reasoned solution is presented below.\n\nThe objective is to find the horizontal offset, $e$, of the shear center from the centroid for the given thin-walled channel section. The cross-section is symmetric about the horizontal axis $y=0$, which is therefore the horizontal centroidal axis. The applied vertical shear force $V$ is in the $+y$ direction, so bending occurs about the horizontal centroidal axis (the neutral axis).\n\nFirst, we calculate the second moment of area, $I$, about the horizontal centroidal axis ($y=0$). The cross-section consists of a vertical web and two horizontal flanges. Using the thin-walled approximation ($t \\ll h, t \\ll b$), we neglect the flanges' second moment of area about their own axes and terms of order $\\mathcal{O}(t^2)$ and higher.\nThe second moment of area of the web is:\n$$I_{\\text{web}} = \\int_{-h/2}^{h/2} y^2 (t \\, dy) = t \\left[\\frac{y^3}{3}\\right]_{-h/2}^{h/2} = \\frac{t h^3}{12}$$\nThe second moment of area of the two flanges is calculated using the parallel axis theorem, where the area of each flange is $A_f = b t$ and their distance from the $y=0$ axis is $h/2$:\n$$I_{\\text{flanges}} = 2 \\times (A_f) \\times \\left(\\frac{h}{2}\\right)^2 = 2 (b t) \\left(\\frac{h^2}{4}\\right) = \\frac{b t h^2}{2}$$\nThe total second moment of area is the sum:\n$$I = I_{\\text{web}} + I_{\\text{flanges}} = \\frac{t h^3}{12} + \\frac{b t h^2}{2} = \\frac{t h^2}{12}(h + 6b)$$\n\nNext, we determine the shear flow distribution, $q(s)$, using the formula $q = VQ/I$. Let's analyze the top flange. We define a coordinate $s$ starting from the free tip ($z=b$) and increasing towards the web ($z=0$). For a point at a distance $s$ from the tip, the first moment of area, $Q$, of the section beyond this point is:\n$$Q_{\\text{flange}}(s) = (\\text{Area}) \\times (\\text{y-distance to neutral axis}) = (s t) \\times \\left(\\frac{h}{2}\\right) = \\frac{s t h}{2}$$\nThe shear flow in the top flange is:\n$$q_{\\text{flange}}(s) = \\frac{V Q_{\\text{flange}}(s)}{I} = \\frac{V}{I} \\left(\\frac{s t h}{2}\\right) = \\frac{V t h s}{2I}$$\nThis shear flow is directed from the free tip towards the web, i.e., in the $-z$ direction. The total horizontal force, $F_f$, in the top flange is the integral of the shear flow along its width:\n$$F_f = \\int_0^b q_{\\text{flange}}(s) \\, ds = \\int_0^b \\frac{V t h s}{2I} \\, ds = \\frac{V t h}{2I} \\left[\\frac{s^2}{2}\\right]_0^b = \\frac{V t h b^2}{4I}$$\nBy symmetry, the shear flow in the bottom flange has the same magnitude distribution but is directed from the web towards the free tip (in the $+z$ direction) to maintain the flow continuity from the web. This results in a horizontal force of the same magnitude $F_f$ in the $+z$ direction.\n\nThese two horizontal forces, $F_f$ in the top flange and $F_f$ in the bottom flange, are separated by a vertical distance $h$. They form a couple, creating an internal twisting moment, $M_{\\text{int}}$, about any point in the cross-section. The magnitude of this moment is:\n$$M_{\\text{int}} = F_f \\times h = \\frac{V t h^2 b^2}{4I}$$\nThe direction of this internal moment is clockwise when viewed from the positive $x$-axis.\n\nThe shear center is the point $(y_{SC}, z_{SC})$ through which the external shear force $V$ must pass to produce bending with no twisting. By symmetry, the shear center must lie on the $y=0$ axis, so $y_{SC}=0$. The moment produced by the external force $V$ applied at the shear center must balance the internal twisting moment $M_{\\text{int}}$. Let's take moments about the centerline of the web ($z=0$). The shear flow in the web acts along this line and thus produces no moment about it. The moment from the flange forces is $M_{\\text{int}}$. The external force $V$ acting at $z=z_{SC}$ produces a moment $M_{ext} = V z_{SC}$. To produce a counter-clockwise moment to balance the clockwise $M_{int}$, $z_{SC}$ must be negative. Equating the magnitudes of the moments:\n$$V(-z_{SC}) = M_{\\text{int}} = \\frac{V t h^2 b^2}{4I}$$\nSolving for $z_{SC}$, the horizontal coordinate of the shear center:\n$$z_{SC} = -\\frac{t h^2 b^2}{4I}$$\nSubstituting the expression for $I$:\n$$z_{SC} = -\\frac{t h^2 b^2}{4 \\left(\\frac{t h^2}{12}(h + 6b)\\right)} = -\\frac{b^2}{\\frac{1}{3}(h + 6b)} = -\\frac{3b^2}{h+6b}$$\n\nThe problem requires the offset, $e$, from the centroid to the shear center. We must first find the centroid's horizontal coordinate, $z_C$. The total area of the section is $A = A_{\\text{web}} + A_{\\text{flanges}} = ht + 2bt = t(h+2b)$. The first moment of area of the section about the $y$-axis ($z=0$) is:\n$$S_y = \\int z \\, dA = \\int_{\\text{web}} z \\, dA + \\int_{\\text{flanges}} z \\, dA$$\nThe web is at $z=0$, so its contribution is zero. For the two flanges:\n$$S_y = 2 \\times \\int_0^b z (t \\, dz) = 2t \\left[\\frac{z^2}{2}\\right]_0^b = t b^2$$\nThe centroid coordinate $z_C$ is:\n$$z_C = \\frac{S_y}{A} = \\frac{t b^2}{t(h+2b)} = \\frac{b^2}{h+2b}$$\n\nFinally, the offset $e$ is defined as the signed horizontal offset from the centroid to the shear center, positive towards negative $z$. This corresponds to $e = z_C - z_{SC}$.\n$$e = z_C - z_{SC} = \\frac{b^2}{h+2b} - \\left(-\\frac{3b^2}{h+6b}\\right) = \\frac{b^2}{h+2b} + \\frac{3b^2}{h+6b}$$\nTo combine these terms, we find a common denominator:\n$$e = b^2 \\left( \\frac{(h+6b) + 3(h+2b)}{(h+2b)(h+6b)} \\right)$$\n$$e = b^2 \\left( \\frac{h+6b+3h+6b}{(h+2b)(h+6b)} \\right) = b^2 \\left( \\frac{4h+12b}{(h+2b)(h+6b)} \\right)$$\nFactoring out a $4$ from the numerator gives the final expression for $e$:\n$$e = \\frac{4b^2(h+3b)}{(h+2b)(h+6b)}$$\nThis is the required closed-form expression for the offset of the shear center from the centroid, in terms of $b$ and $h$ only.

We proceed with the derivation.\n\nLet's establish a coordinate system $(y', z')$.

The top and bottom flanges extend from $z'=0$ to $z'=b$. By symmetry, the centroid and shear center lie on the $z'$-axis.

Shear Center Location from Web ($z'_{SC}$)**\nThe location of the shear center relative to the web midline ($z'=0$), which we'll call $z'_{SC}$, is given by the requirement that the moment from the external force $V_y$ balances the moment from the internal shear flows. Taking moments about the web midline, this gives:\n$$z'_{SC} = \\frac{h^2}{2 I_z} \\int_0^b z' t(z') dz'$$\nwhere $I_z$ is the second moment of area about the horizontal centroidal axis and the integral is the first moment of area of one flange about the web midline.\n\nThe flange thickness is given with a coordinate $z$ from the free edge. In our $z'$ system (from the web), $z = b - z'$, so the thickness is $t(z') = t_0(1 + (b-z')/b) = t_0(2 - z'/b)$.\n\n**2.

This means the total torque about any point in the cross-section, produced by the external applied force and the internal shear flow resultants, must be zero. We take moments about the origin of the coordinate system.\n\nThe torque from the external force $\\mathbf{V}$ applied at $\\mathbf{r}_s$ is $\\mathbf{T}_{ext} = \\mathbf{r}_{s} \\times \\mathbf{V}$.\nThe internal shear force in component $\\mathrm{C}_{1}$ is a vector $\\mathbf{V}_{1}$ acting at its shear center $\\mathbf{r}_{s1}$. Similarly, the internal force in $\\mathrm{C}_{2}$ is $\\mathbf{V}_{2}$ acting at $\\mathbf{r}_{s2}$. The problem states that $\\mathbf{V}_{1}$ and $\\mathbf{V}_{2}$ are collinear with $\\mathbf{V}$. Let $\\mathbf{u}$ be the unit vector in the direction of $\\mathbf{V}$, such that $\\mathbf{V} = V\\mathbf{u}$. Then $\\mathbf{V}_{1} = V_{1}\\mathbf{u}$ and $\\mathbf{V}_{2} = V_{2}\\mathbf{u}$.\n\nThe total torque from the internal forces is $\\mathbf{T}_{int} = (\\mathbf{r}_{s1} \\times \\mathbf{V}_{1}) + (\\mathbf{r}_{s2} \\times \\mathbf{V}_{2})$.\nThe condition for zero twist is $\\mathbf{T}_{ext} = \\mathbf{T}_{int}$:\n$$\n\\mathbf{r}_{s} \\times \\mathbf{V} = (\\mathbf{r}_{s1} \\times \\mathbf{V}_{1}) + (\\mathbf{r}_{s2} \\times \\mathbf{V}_{2})\n$$\nSubstitute the expressions for $\\mathbf{V}$, $\\mathbf{V}_{1}$, and $\\mathbf{V}_{2}$:\n$$\n\\mathbf{r}_{s} \\times (V\\mathbf{u}) = \\left(\\mathbf{r}_{s1} \\times \\left(V \\frac{K_{1}}{K_{1} + K_{2}}\\right)\\mathbf{u}\\right) + \\left(\\mathbf{r}_{s2} \\times \\left(V \\frac{K_{2}}{K_{1} + K_{2}}\\right)\\mathbf{u}\\right)\n$$\nThe scalar terms can be factored out of the cross products:\n$$\nV (\\mathbf{r}_{s} \\times \\mathbf{u}) = V \\frac{K_{1}}{K_{1} + K_{2}} (\\mathbf{r}_{s1} \\times \\mathbf{u}) + V \\frac{K_{2}}{K_{1} + K_{2}} (\\mathbf{r}_{s2} \\times \\mathbf{u})\n$$\nAssuming $V \\neq 0$, we can divide by $V$:\n$$\n\\mathbf{r}_{s} \\times \\mathbf{u} = \\left(\\frac{K_{1}\\mathbf{r}_{s1}}{K_{1} + K_{2}}\\right) \\times \\mathbf{u} + \\left(\\frac{K_{2}\\mathbf{r}_{s2}}{K_{1} + K_{2}}\\right) \\times \\mathbf{u}\n$$\nRearranging the terms, we get:\n$$\n\\left( \\mathbf{r}_{s} - \\frac{K_{1}\\mathbf{r}_{s1} + K_{2}\\mathbf{r}_{s2}}{K_{1} + K_{2}} \\right) \\times \\mathbf{u} = \\mathbf{0}\n$$\nThis equation must hold for any direction $\\mathbf{u}$ of the transverse shear force in the $x$-$y$ plane. If the cross product of two vectors is zero for any arbitrary direction of one of them in a plane, the other vector must be the zero vector. Therefore:\n$$\n\\mathbf{r}_{s} - \\frac{K_{1}\\mathbf{r}_{s1} + K_{2}\\mathbf{r}_{s2}}{K_{1} + K_{2}} = \\mathbf{0}\n$$\nThis yields the expression for the shear center of the composite beam:\n$$\n\\mathbf{r}_{s} = \\frac{K_{1}\\mathbf{r}_{s1} + K_{2}\\mathbf{r}_{s2}}{K_{1} + K_{2}}\n$$\nThe result is a weighted average of the individual shear centers, where the weights are the shear stiffnesses of the components.\n\n**(b) Limiting Behavior of the Shear Center**\n\nWe are asked to compute the limit of $\\mathbf{r}_{s}$ as the stiffness of component $\\mathrm{C}_{1}$ is scaled by a factor $\\eta \\to \\infty$. We are given the substitutions $K_{1}\\mapsto \\eta K_{1}^{0}$ while $K_{2}$ is held constant. The positions $\\mathbf{r}_{s1}$ and $\\mathbf{r}_{s2}$ are geometric properties of the components and do not change.\nLet $\\mathbf{r}_{s}(\\eta)$ be the shear center as a function of $\\eta$:\n$$\n\\mathbf{r}_{s}(\\eta) = \\frac{(\\eta K_{1}^{0})\\mathbf{r}_{s1} + K_{2}\\mathbf{r}_{s2}}{(\\eta K_{1}^{0}) + K_{2}}\n$$\nWe need to evaluate the limit of this expression as $\\eta \\to \\infty$. To do so, we divide the numerator and the denominator by $\\eta$:\n$$\n\\mathbf{r}_{s}(\\eta) = \\frac{K_{1}^{0}\\mathbf{r}_{s1} + \\frac{1}{\\eta}K_{2}\\mathbf{r}_{s2}}{K_{1}^{0} + \\frac{1}{\\eta}K_{2}}\n$$\nNow, we take the limit:\n$$\n\\lim_{\\eta\\to\\infty} \\mathbf{r}_{s}(\\eta) = \\lim_{\\eta\\to\\infty} \\frac{K_{1}^{0}\\mathbf{r}_{s1} + \\frac{K_{2}}{\\eta}\\mathbf{r}_{s2}}{K_{1}^{0} + \\frac{K_{2}}{\\eta}}\n$$\nAs $\\eta \\to \\infty$, the terms with $\\frac{1}{\\eta}$ approach zero:\n$$\n\\lim_{\\eta\\to\\infty} \\mathbf{r}_{s}(\\eta) = \\frac{K_{1}^{0}\\mathbf{r}_{s1} + 0 \\cdot \\mathbf{r}_{s2}}{K_{1}^{0} + 0} = \\frac{K_{1}^{0}\\mathbf{r}_{s1}}{K_{1}^{0}}\n$$\nSince $K_{1}^{0}$ represents a physical stiffness, it must be non-zero (specifically, positive). Therefore, we can simplify the expression to:\n$$\n\\lim_{\\eta\\to\\infty} \\mathbf{r}_{s}(\\eta) = \\mathbf{r}_{s1}\n$$\nThis result is physically intuitive. As the shear stiffness of component $\\mathrm{C}_{1}$ becomes infinitely large relative to that of component $\\mathrm{C}_{2}$, component $\\mathrm{C}_{1}$ carries essentially the entire shear force ($V_{1} \\to V$, $V_{2} \\to 0$). The behavior of the composite beam becomes dominated by component $\\mathrm{C}_{1}$, and thus its shear center converges to the shear center of component $\\mathrm{C}_{1}$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\mathbf{r}_{s1}}\n$$", "id": "2699978"}]}
