It is a standard, formal problem in mechanics of materials. A solution will be provided.\n\nThe critical buckling stress, $\\sigma_{cr}$, for a column is given by the generalized Euler formula, which incorporates the tangent modulus, $E_{t}$, at the instant of buckling. For a column with effective length $KL$, cross-sectional area $A$, and second moment of area $I$, the critical stress is:\n$$\n\\sigma_{cr} = \\frac{P_{cr}}{A} = \\frac{\\pi^2 E_t I}{A (KL)^2}\n$$\nUsing the definitions of the radius of gyration, $r = \\sqrt{I/A}$, and the slenderness ratio, $\\lambda = KL/r$, this equation simplifies to:\n$$\n\\sigma_{cr} = \\frac{\\pi^2 E_t}{\\lambda^2}\n$$\nThe tangent modulus, $E_t$, is dependent on the stress level. Based on the provided bilinear material model, we have two distinct regimes:\n\n1.  **Elastic Buckling Regime**: This regime corresponds to buckling at a stress level at or below the material's yield stress, i.e., $\\sigma_{cr} \\leq \\sigma_{y}$. In this range, the material is elastic, and the tangent modulus is equal to the elastic modulus, $E_{t} = E$. The governing equation is the classical Euler buckling formula:\n    $$\n    \\sigma_{cr} = \\frac{\\pi^2 E}{\\lambda^2}\n    $$\n    This formula is applicable only if the slenderness ratio $\\lambda$ is sufficiently large to ensure that the calculated $\\sigma_{cr}$ does not exceed $\\sigma_{y}$.\n\n2.  **Inelastic Buckling Regime**: This regime corresponds to buckling at a stress level above the material's yield stress, i.e., $\\sigma_{cr} > \\sigma_{y}$. In this range, the material has yielded and exhibits strain hardening. The tangent modulus is equal to the post-yield hardening modulus, $E_{t} = E_{h}$. The governing equation is:\n    $$\n    \\sigma_{cr} = \\frac{\\pi^2 E_h}{\\lambda^2}\n    $$\n    This formula is applicable for columns with a slenderness ratio $\\lambda$ small enough that the column becomes unstable only after the average stress has surpassed $\\sigma_{y}$.\n\nThe problem requires finding the slenderness threshold, $\\lambda_{\\mathrm{th}}$, that separates these two behavioral regimes. This threshold represents the boundary condition where the mode of failure transitions from elastic to inelastic buckling. This transition occurs when the critical stress predicted by the elastic Euler formula is exactly equal to the material's yield stress, $\\sigma_{y}$. For any slenderness ratio greater than $\\lambda_{\\mathrm{th}}$, the column will buckle elastically at a stress below $\\sigma_{y}$. For any slenderness ratio less than $\\lambda_{\\mathrm{th}}$, the Euler formula would erroneously predict a buckling stress greater than $\\sigma_{y}$, indicating that the column must first yield, and thus buckling is an inelastic phenomenon.\n\nTherefore, the condition defining the threshold $\\lambda_{\\mathrm{th}}$ is:\n$$\n\\sigma_{y} = \\frac{\\pi^2 E}{\\lambda_{\\mathrm{th}}^2}\n$$\nWe solve this equation for $\\lambda_{\\mathrm{th}}$. Rearranging the terms, we get:\n$$\n\\lambda_{\\mathrm{th}}^2 = \\frac{\\pi^2 E}{\\sigma_{y}}\n$$\nTaking the positive square root, as slenderness ratio is by definition a positive quantity, we arrive at the expression for the slenderness threshold:\n$$\n\\lambda_{\\mathrm{th}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\pi^2 E}{\\sigma_{y}}}\n$$\nThis can be simplified to:\n$$\n\\lambda_{\\mathrm{th}} = \\pi \\sqrt{\\frac{E}{\\sigma_{y}}}\n$$\nThis expression is in terms of only the specified variables $E$ and $\\sigma_{y}$, as required.

It is scientifically sound, well-posed, objective, and contains all necessary information for a complete solution. Therefore, I will proceed with the derivation and analysis.\n\nThe tangent modulus, $E_t$, is defined as the derivative of stress with respect to strain:\n$$E_t(\\sigma) = \\frac{d\\sigma}{d\\epsilon}$$\nThis is the reciprocal of the derivative of strain with respect to stress, $\\frac{d\\epsilon}{d\\sigma}$.

The expression for $E_t$ becomes:\n$$E_t(n) = \\frac{E}{1 + \\frac{E \\alpha n}{\\sigma_0} r^{n-1}}$$\nLet the constant term be $C = \\frac{E\\alpha}{\\sigma_0} > 0$. The expression simplifies to:\n$$E_t(n) = \\frac{E}{1 + C (n r^{n-1})}$$\nThe variation of $E_t$ with $n$ is inversely related to the variation of the function $g(n) = n r^{n-1}$ for $n>1$. We analyze $g(n)$ in three regimes for $r$.\n\n1.  **Regime $r > 1$ (stress above the reference stress):**\n    In this case, $r$ is a number greater than $1$. As $n$ increases, both $n$ and $r^{n-1}$ increase. Their product $g(n) = n r^{n-1}$ is a strictly increasing function of $n$. Consequently, the denominator of $E_t(n)$ increases, and thus $E_t(n)$ is a **strictly decreasing** function of $n$.\n\n2.  **Regime $r = 1$ (stress at the reference stress):**\n    Here, $r^{n-1} = 1^{n-1} = 1$ for all $n$. The function becomes $g(n) = n$. This is a strictly increasing function of $n$. Therefore, $E_t(n)$ is a **strictly decreasing** function of $n$.\n\n3.  **Regime $r  1$ (stress below the reference stress):**\n    This case is more complex. We examine the derivative of $g(n)$ with respect to $n$:\n    $$\\frac{dg}{dn} = \\frac{d}{dn}(n e^{(n-1)\\ln(r)}) = e^{(n-1)\\ln(r)} + n e^{(n-1)\\ln(r)}\\ln(r) = r^{n-1}(1 + n\\ln(r))$$\n    Since $r  1$, $\\ln(r)$ is negative. The sign of $\\frac{dg}{dn}$ depends on the term $(1 + n\\ln(r))$. There exists a critical value of $n$, denoted $n_{crit}$, where this term is zero:\n    $$1 + n_{crit}\\ln(r) = 0 \\implies n_{crit} = -\\frac{1}{\\ln(r)}$$\n    Since $r1$, $\\ln(r)0$, so $n_{crit} > 0$. The behavior depends on whether $n_{crit}$ is greater or less than $1$ (the lower bound for $n$).\n    $n_{crit} > 1 \\iff -\\frac{1}{\\ln(r)} > 1 \\iff -1  \\ln(r) \\iff e^{-1}  r$.\n\n    -   **Sub-regime $e^{-1}  r  1$**: Here, $n_{crit} > 1$.\n        For $1  n  n_{crit}$, we have $n  -1/\\ln(r)$ which implies $1+n\\ln(r) > 0$, so $\\frac{dg}{dn} > 0$. The function $g(n)$ increases.\n        For $n  n_{crit}$, we have $1+n\\ln(r)  0$, so $\\frac{dg}{dn}  0$. The function $g(n)$ decreases.\n        Thus, $g(n)$ has a maximum at $n=n_{crit}$. Correspondingly, $E_t(n)$ has a **minimum** at $n = n_{crit}$. It first decreases for $1  n  n_{crit}$ and then increases for $n  n_{crit}$.\n\n    -   **Sub-regime $0  r \\le e^{-1}$**: Here, $\\ln(r) \\le -1$, which implies $n_{crit} = -1/\\ln(r) \\le 1$.\n        Since the domain for $n$ is $n>1$, we are always in the region $n  n_{crit}$. In this region, $1+n\\ln(r)  0$, so $\\frac{dg}{dn}  0$. The function $g(n)$ is strictly decreasing for all $n>1$.\n        As $n \\to \\infty$, $g(n) = n r^{n-1} \\to 0$.\n        Therefore, $E_t(n)$ is a **strictly increasing** function of $n$, approaching its elastic limit $E$ as $n \\to \\infty$.\n\nIn summary, the key threshold value for $n$ is $n_{crit} = -1/\\ln(r)$, which is relevant only when $r  e^{-1}$. The behavior of $E_t$ with increasing $n$ depends fundamentally on whether the stress is above or below the reference stress, with the sub-yield region showing complex non-monotonic behavior dependent on the value of $r$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{E}{1 + \\frac{E \\alpha n}{\\sigma_{0}} \\left(\\frac{\\sigma}{\\sigma_{0}}\\right)^{n-1}}}$$", "id": "2894136"}, {"introduction": "In many practical scenarios, columns experience combined axial loads and bending moments, leading to a non-uniform stress distribution where some parts of the cross-section have yielded and others remain elastic.

A solution will be provided based on the specified methodology.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe solution requires calculating section properties based on a fiber discretization of the rectangular cross-section. The core of the problem is to determine the tangent modulus for each fiber based on its current stress level and then to sum the contributions of all fibers to obtain the macroscopic section response.\n\nFirst, we discretize the cross-section of width $b$ and depth $h$ into $N_f$ horizontal layers, or fibers. Each fiber has a height of $\\Delta y = h / N_f$ and an area of $A_f = b \\cdot \\Delta y = b h / N_f$. The centroid of the $i$-th fiber (where $i$ is indexed from $0$ to $N_f-1$, bottom to top) is located at coordinate $y_i$:\n$$ y_i = -\\frac{h}{2} + \\left(i + \\frac{1}{2}\\right) \\Delta y = -\\frac{h}{2} + \\left(i + \\frac{1}{2}\\right) \\frac{h}{N_f} $$\n\nFor each test case, the stress $\\sigma_i$ at the centroid of each fiber is calculated using the given linear stress distribution:\n$$ \\sigma_i = \\sigma(y_i) = s_0 + s_1 \\left(\\frac{2y_i}{h}\\right) $$\nwhere $s_0$ and $s_1$ are parameters for the specific case.\n\nNext, the tangent modulus $E_{t,i}$ for each fiber is determined from the bilinear material law, which depends on the absolute value of the stress $\\sigma_i$ relative to the yield stress $\\sigma_y$:\n$$ E_{t,i} = E_t(\\sigma_i) = \\begin{cases} E  \\text{if } |\\sigma_i| \\le \\sigma_y \\\\ E_p  \\text{if } |\\sigma_i|  \\sigma_y \\end{cases} $$\nHere, $E$ is the elastic modulus and $E_p$ is the post-yield tangent modulus.\n\nWith the tangent modulus of each fiber established, we can compute the section's tangent stiffness properties by approximating the governing integrals with summations over the fibers.\n\nThe axial tangent stiffness, $S_N$, is the sum of the stiffness contributions of all fibers:\n$$ S_N = \\sum_{i=0}^{N_f-1} E_{t,i} A_f $$\nThis value corresponds to the integral $\\int_A E_t(y) \\, \\mathrm{d}A$.\n\nThe location of the incremental neutral axis, $y_n$, is the $E_t$-weighted centroid of the section area. It is found by setting the $E_t$-weighted first moment of area about this axis to zero. Solving for $y_n$:\n$$ \\sum_{i=0}^{N_f-1} E_{t,i} A_f (y_i - y_n) = 0 \\implies y_n = \\frac{\\sum_{i=0}^{N_f-1} E_{t,i} A_f y_i}{\\sum_{i=0}^{N_f-1} E_{t,i} A_f} = \\frac{\\sum_{i=0}^{N_f-1} E_{t,i} y_i}{\\sum_{i=0}^{N_f-1} E_{t,i}} $$\nThe term $A_f$ cancels from the numerator and denominator.\n\nThe tangent bending stiffness, $S_M$, is the $E_t$-weighted second moment of area about the incremental neutral axis $y_n$. This is calculated using the parallel axis theorem in its discrete form for each fiber:\n$$ S_M = \\sum_{i=0}^{N_f-1} E_{t,i} A_f (y_i - y_n)^2 $$\nThis value corresponds to the integral $\\int_A E_t(y) (y - y_n)^2 \\, \\mathrm{d}A$, which represents the effective bending stiffness $(EI)_{eff}$ in the tangent modulus theory.\n\nFinally, the tangent modulus critical buckling load, $P_\\text{cr}$, is calculated using the Euler buckling formula with the tangent bending stiffness $S_M$ and the column's effective length, $K L$:\n$$ P_\\text{cr} = \\frac{\\pi^2 S_M}{(K L)^2} $$\n\nThis procedure is applied to each of the four test cases specified in the problem statement.
