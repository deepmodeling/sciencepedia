For a single-cell section, the shear flow $q = \\tau(s) t(s)$ is constant along the contour.\n$$ T = \\oint q r_{\\perp} ds $$\nwhere $r_{\\perp}$ is the perpendicular distance from a point on the line of action of the torque to the tangent of the median line. Since $q$ is constant, it can be taken out of the integral:\n$$ T = q \\oint r_{\\perp} ds $$\nThe geometric integral $\\oint r_{\\perp} ds$ is equal to twice the area enclosed by the median line, $2A_m$.

We proceed with the solution.\n\nThe derivation must begin from fundamental principles as instructed.\n\nFirst, consider a general thin-walled closed section of arbitrary shape with median line perimeter coordinate $s$ and wall thickness $t(s)$. Under an applied torque $T$, a shear stress $\\tau$ develops in the wall. The shear flow is defined as $q(s) = \\tau(s) t(s)$. By considering the equilibrium of a small element of the tube wall, it can be shown that the shear flow $q$ must be constant along the perimeter for a closed section. Thus, $q$ is independent of $s$.\n\nThe total applied torque $T$ is the integral of the moments produced by the shear flow around the cross-section. The force on a differential element of the perimeter $ds$ is $dF = q ds$. The moment of this force about any point O inside the contour is $dT = \\rho (q ds)$, where $\\rho$ is the perpendicular distance from O to the tangent at $ds$. The total torque is the integral over the median-line perimeter:\n$$\nT = \\oint q \\rho \\, ds = q \\oint \\rho \\, ds\n$$\nThe geometric quantity $\\oint \\rho \\, ds$ is equal to twice the area enclosed by the median line, $2A_m$. Thus, we arrive at Bredt's first formula:\n$$\nT = 2qA_m\n$$\n\nNext, we establish a relationship between the torque $T$ and the rate of twist, $\\phi = d\\theta/dx$, by considering strain energy. The strain energy per unit volume is $u = \\frac{\\tau^2}{2G}$. The total strain energy stored per unit length of the tube, $U'$, is found by integrating $u$ over the volume of a unit length:\n$$\nU' = \\oint \\frac{\\tau^2}{2G} (t \\, ds) = \\oint \\frac{q^2}{2Gt^2} (t \\, ds) = \\frac{q^2}{2G} \\oint \\frac{ds}{t}\n$$\nThe external work done by the torque $T$ during twisting through an angle $\\phi$ over a unit length is $W' = \\frac{1}{2} T \\phi$. By the principle of conservation of energy for an elastic body, $W' = U'$.\n$$\n\\frac{1}{2} T \\phi = \\frac{q^2}{2G} \\oint \\frac{ds}{t}\n$$\nSubstitute $q = \\frac{T}{2A_m}$ from Bredt's first formula into this energy balance equation:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{2} T \\phi = \\frac{1}{2G} \\left(\\frac{T}{2A_m}\\right)^2 \\oint \\frac{ds}{t}\n$$\nSolving for the rate of twist $\\phi = d\\theta/dx$ yields Bredt's second formula:\n$$\n\\phi = \\frac{T}{4A_m^2 G} \\oint \\frac{ds}{t}\n$$\nWe are given the definition of the torsional constant $J_t$ as $T = G J_t \\phi$. Rearranging gives $\\phi = \\frac{T}{GJ_t}$. Comparing this with Bredt's second formula, we identify the expression for the torsional constant:\n$$\nJ_t = \\frac{4A_m^2}{\\oint \\frac{ds}{t}}\n$$\nThis is the general formula for a thin-walled closed section.\n\nNow, we specialize this result to the given problem. The tube has a uniform wall thickness $t$. The integral in the denominator becomes:\n$$\n\\oint \\frac{ds}{t} = \\frac{1}{t} \\oint ds = \\frac{p}{t}\n$$\nwhere $p$ is the length of the median-line perimeter. The torsional constant for a section with uniform thickness is therefore:\n$$\nJ_t = \\frac{4A_m^2 t}{p}\n$$\nFor the rectangular cross-section with median side lengths $a$ and $b$, the enclosed median area is $A_m = ab$ and the perimeter is $p = 2(a+b)$. Substituting these into the formula for $J_t$:\n$$\nJ_t = \\frac{4(ab)^2 t}{2(a+b)} = \\frac{2a^2b^2t}{a+b}\n$$\n\nThe problem requires us to analyze this expression under the constraint that $A_m$ and $t$ are constant, while the aspect ratio $r = a/b \\geq 1$ varies. Let us express $a$ and $b$ in terms of $A_m$ and $r$.\nFrom $r = a/b$, we have $a = rb$.\nSubstituting this into the area expression, $A_m = (rb)b = rb^2$. This gives:\n$$\nb = \\sqrt{\\frac{A_m}{r}} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad a = r \\sqrt{\\frac{A_m}{r}} = \\sqrt{r A_m}\n$$\nNow, we express $J_t$ as a function of $r$, which we denote $J_t(r)$. It is more direct to use the form $J_t = \\frac{2A_m^2 t}{a+b}$. The denominator is:\n$$\na+b = \\sqrt{rA_m} + \\sqrt{\\frac{A_m}{r}} = \\sqrt{A_m} \\left( \\sqrt{r} + \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{r}} \\right) = \\sqrt{A_m} \\left( \\frac{r+1}{\\sqrt{r}} \\right)\n$$\nSubstituting this into the expression for $J_t(r)$:\n$$\nJ_t(r) = \\frac{2A_m^2 t}{\\sqrt{A_m} \\left( \\frac{r+1}{\\sqrt{r}} \\right)} = \\frac{2A_m^{3/2} t \\sqrt{r}}{r+1}\n$$\nThis is the torsional constant as a function of the aspect ratio $r$, for a fixed enclosed area $A_m$ and thickness $t$.\n\nWe must now evaluate the comparison metric $R(r) \\equiv \\frac{J_t(r)}{J_t(1)}$.\nFor Tube 2, the cross-section is square, which corresponds to an aspect ratio of $r=1$. We evaluate $J_t(1)$:\n$$\nJ_t(1) = \\frac{2A_m^{3/2} t \\sqrt{1}}{1+1} = \\frac{2A_m^{3/2} t}{2} = A_m^{3/2} t\n$$\nNow, we form the ratio $R(r)$:\n$$\nR(r) = \\frac{J_t(r)}{J_t(1)} = \\frac{\\frac{2A_m^{3/2} t \\sqrt{r}}{r+1}}{A_m^{3/2} t} = \\frac{2\\sqrt{r}}{r+1}\n$$\nThis is the required closed-form expression for $R(r)$.\n\nFinally, we are asked to determine which aspect ratio yields higher torsional rigidity. The torsional rigidity is the product $GJ_t$. Since $G$ is a material constant, maximizing torsional rigidity is equivalent to maximizing $J_t$, and thus equivalent to maximizing the function $R(r)$ for $r \\geq 1$.\nLet's analyze the function $R(r) = \\frac{2\\sqrt{r}}{r+1}$. To find its maximum, we examine its derivative with respect to $r$:\n$$\n\\frac{dR}{dr} = 2 \\frac{d}{dr} \\left( \\frac{r^{1/2}}{r+1} \\right) = 2 \\frac{(r+1)(\\frac{1}{2}r^{-1/2}) - (r^{1/2})(1)}{(r+1)^2} = 2 \\frac{\\frac{r+1}{2\\sqrt{r}} - \\sqrt{r}}{(r+1)^2}\n$$\nThe sign of the derivative is determined by its numerator:\n$$\n\\frac{r+1}{2\\sqrt{r}} - \\sqrt{r} = \\frac{r+1 - 2r}{2\\sqrt{r}} = \\frac{1-r}{2\\sqrt{r}}\n$$\nFor the domain $r \\geq 1$, the denominator $2\\sqrt{r}$ is positive. The numerator $1-r$ is zero at $r=1$ and negative for all $r>1$. Therefore, $\\frac{dR}{dr} = 0$ at $r=1$ and $\\frac{dR}{dr} < 0$ for $r > 1$.\nThis analysis demonstrates that the function $R(r)$ has its maximum value at $r=1$ and is a strictly decreasing function for $r > 1$.\nThe conclusion is unequivocal: for a fixed enclosed area $A_m$ and wall thickness $t$, the torsional rigidity is maximized for a square cross-section ($r=1$). Any deviation from a square shape (i.e., $r > 1$) results in a decrease in torsional rigidity. The square profile is the most efficient geometry for resisting torsion under these constraints.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\frac{2\\sqrt{r}}{r+1}}\n$$", "id": "2927412"}, {"introduction": "We now advance from single-cell to multi-cell cross-sections, a configuration common in advanced aerospace and civil structures like aircraft wings and box-girder bridges.

It is a well-posed problem in the field of solid mechanics, specifically the torsion of thin-walled multicell sections. It is scientifically grounded in the Bredt-Batho theory, is free of contradictions or ambiguity, and contains all necessary information for a unique solution. We shall proceed with the derivation as requested.\n\nThe analysis is based on two fundamental principles for the torsion of thin-walled closed sections: equilibrium of moments (torque balance) and kinematic compatibility (uniform rate of twist).\n\nFirst, we introduce two auxiliary unknowns, $q_1$ and $q_2$, representing the constant basic shear flows circulating in the midline of cell $1$ and cell $2$, respectively. We adopt a sign convention where both $q_1$ and $q_2$ are positive for clockwise circulation, which, by the right-hand rule, corresponds to a positive torque contribution.\n\nThe total applied torque $T$ must be balanced by the sum of the torques generated by the shear flows in each cell. According to Bredt's first formula, the torque $T_i$ produced by a shear flow $q_i$ in a cell of enclosed area $A_i$ is given by $T_i = 2q_iA_i$. The total torque for the two-cell section is therefore the sum of the individual contributions:\n$$T = 2q_1A_1 + 2q_2A_2$$\nThis is the torque equilibrium equation, our first governing equation.\n\nSecond, we establish the kinematic compatibility condition. The section is assumed to twist as a rigid body in its plane, which implies that the rate of twist, $\\theta'$, must be the same for both cells and for the section as a whole. The problem provides the formula for the rate of twist for a single closed cell:\n$$\\theta' = \\frac{1}{2AG} \\oint_{\\mathcal{C}} \\frac{q(s)}{t(s)} ds$$\nHere, $q(s)$ is the actual shear flow along the wall boundary $\\mathcal{C}$ of a cell with enclosed area $A$. The shear modulus is $G$ and the wall thickness is $t(s)$.\n\nWe must apply this formula to each cell, carefully accounting for the actual shear flow in each wall segment. The thickness $t$ is uniform throughout the section.\nThe actual shear flow in the outer walls of cell $1$ and cell $2$ are $q_1$ and $q_2$, respectively. The common internal wall is shared, so its net shear flow is a superposition of the two basic flows. If we integrate along the clockwise path of cell $1$, the flow on the common wall of length $\\ell_m$ is $(q_1 - q_2)$. Similarly, for the clockwise path of cell $2$, the flow on the same common wall is $(q_2 - q_1)$.\n\nFor cell $1$, with enclosed area $A_1$ and midline perimeter $p_1$, the application of the twist rate formula gives:\n$$2A_1G\\theta' = \\oint_{\\mathcal{C}_1} \\frac{q(s)}{t} ds = \\frac{1}{t} \\left[ \\int_{\\text{outer wall 1}} q_1 ds + \\int_{\\text{common wall}} (q_1 - q_2) ds \\right]$$\nThe length of the outer wall of cell $1$ is $(p_1 - \\ell_m)$.
