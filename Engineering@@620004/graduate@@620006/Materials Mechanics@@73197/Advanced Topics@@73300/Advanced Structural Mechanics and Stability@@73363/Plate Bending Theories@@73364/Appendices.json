A direct consequence of this kinematic constraint, under the assumption of small deflections, is that the in-plane strains $\\epsilon_{xx}$, $\\epsilon_{yy}$ and the shear strain $\\gamma_{xy}$ at a distance $z$ from the mid-surface are linearly proportional to $z$ and the curvatures of the mid-surface. The curvatures are defined in terms of the second partial derivatives of the transverse deflection $w(x,y)$.

For a linearly elastic, isotropic material under a state of plane stress ($\\sigma_{zz} = 0$), the in-plane stresses are related to the in-plane strains by:\n$$\n\\sigma_{xx} = \\frac{E}{1-\\nu^2}(\\epsilon_{xx} + \\nu\\epsilon_{yy}) \\quad , \\quad \\sigma_{yy} = \\frac{E}{1-\\nu^2}(\\epsilon_{yy} + \\nu\\epsilon_{xx}) \\quad , \\quad \\tau_{xy} = G\\gamma_{xy} = \\frac{E}{2(1+\\nu)}\\gamma_{xy}\n$$\nSubstituting the strain expressions:\n$$\n\\sigma_{xx}(z) = \\frac{Ez}{1-\\nu^2}(\\kappa_{x} + \\nu\\kappa_{y}) \\quad , \\quad \\sigma_{yy}(z) = \\frac{Ez}{1-\\nu^2}(\\kappa_{y} + \\nu\\kappa_{x}) \\quad , \\quad \\tau_{xy}(z) = \\frac{Ez}{2(1+\\nu)}\\kappa_{xy}\n$$\nThe bending moments ($M_x$, $M_y$) and twisting moment ($M_{xy}$) per unit length are obtained by integrating the stresses multiplied by the moment arm $z$ through the plate thickness $h$:\n$$\nM_x = \\int_{-h/2}^{h/2} \\sigma_{xx} z \\,dz \\quad , \\quad M_y = \\int_{-h/2}^{h/2} \\sigma_{yy} z \\,dz \\quad , \\quad M_{xy} = \\int_{-h/2}^{h/2} \\tau_{xy} z \\,dz\n$$\nThe integral of $z^2$ is $\\int_{-h/2}^{h/2} z^2 \\,dz = \\frac{h^3}{12}$.

It also modifies the effective twisting stiffness of the plate.\n\n3) Comparison with Mindlin–Reissner Theory\nIn Mindlin–Reissner (first-order shear deformation) theory, the normality condition of the Kirchhoff–Love hypothesis is relaxed. The rotations of the normal, $\\theta_x$ and $\\theta_y$, are treated as independent kinematic variables along with the transverse deflection $w$. The curvatures are defined as derivatives of these rotations: $\\kappa_x = \\frac{\\partial\\theta_x}{\\partial x}$, $\\kappa_y = \\frac{\\partial\\theta_y}{\\partial y}$, and $\\kappa_{xy} = \\frac{\\partial\\theta_x}{\\partial y} + \\frac{\\partial\\theta_y}{\\partial x}$. The moment-curvature constitutive relation in Mindlin–Reissner theory is formally identical to the one derived above for Kirchhoff–Love theory. The fundamental difference lies in the definition of the curvatures and the allowance for non-zero transverse shear strains, which are given by $\\gamma_{xz} = \\frac{\\partial w}{\\partial x} + \\theta_x$ and $\\gamma_{yz} = \\frac{\\partial w}{\\partial y} + \\theta_y$.\n\nThe two theories coincide for the curvature field under the kinematic condition that the transverse shear strains vanish, i.e., $\\gamma_{xz} = 0$ and $\\gamma_{yz} = 0$. This forces the rotations to become dependent on the deflection: $\\theta_x = -\\frac{\\partial w}{\\partial x}$ and $\\theta_y = -\\frac{\\partial w}{\\partial y}$. Substituting these into the Mindlin–Reissner curvature definitions recovers precisely the Kirchhoff–Love curvature definitions:\n$$\n\\kappa_x^{\\text{RM}} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}\\left(-\\frac{\\partial w}{\\partial x}\\right) = -\\frac{\\partial^2 w}{\\partial x^2} = \\kappa_x^{\\text{KL}}\n$$\n$$\n\\kappa_y^{\\text{RM}} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}\\left(-\\frac{\\partial w}{\\partial y}\\right) = -\\frac{\\partial^2 w}{\\partial y^2} = \\kappa_y^{\\text{KL}}\n$$\n$$\n\\kappa_{xy}^{\\text{RM}} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}\\left(-\\frac{\\partial w}{\\partial x}\\right) + \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}\\left(-\\frac{\\partial w}{\\partial y}\\right) = -2\\frac{\\partial^2 w}{\\partial x \\partial y} = \\kappa_{xy}^{\\text{KL}}\n$$\nThus, the condition for coincidence is the enforcement of the Kirchhoff–Love hypothesis itself (zero transverse shear deformation).\n\nVerification of Boundary Conditions\nA simply supported edge has zero transverse deflection. We check the given $w(x,y)$ on all four edges:\n- At $x=0$: $w(0,y) = w_{0}\\,\\sin(0)\\,\\sin(\\frac{n\\pi y}{b}) = 0$.\n- At $x=a$: $w(a,y) = w_{0}\\,\\sin(m\\pi)\\,\\sin(\\frac{n\\pi y}{b}) = 0$, since $m$ is an integer.\n- At $y=0$: $w(x,0) = w_{0}\\,\\sin(\\frac{m\\pi x}{a})\\,\\sin(0) = 0$.\n- At $y=b$: $w(x,b) = w_{0}\\,\\sin(\\frac{m\\pi x}{a})\\,\\sin(n\\pi) = 0$, since $n$ is an integer.\nThe geometric boundary conditions for a simply supported plate are satisfied.\n\nThe problem asks to state, without derivation, whether the bending moment boundary condition is satisfied. For a simply supported edge, the bending moment normal to that edge must be zero (e.g., $M_x=0$ on edges $x=0, a$ and $M_y=0$ on edges $y=0, b$). The given deflection function $w(x,y)$ is the exact solution form for a simply supported rectangular plate under a specific sinusoidal loading (a Navier solution). As such, this function correctly satisfies both the geometric (zero deflection) and natural (zero normal moment) boundary conditions on all four simply supported edges.

The rotations are related only to the bending deflection: $\\phi_x = -\\dfrac{\\partial w_b}{\\partial x}$ and $\\phi_y = -\\dfrac{\\partial w_b}{\\partial y}$.\nThe transverse shear strains become: $\\gamma_{xz} = \\phi_x + \\frac{\\partial w}{\\partial x} = -\\dfrac{\\partial w_b}{\\partial x} + \\frac{\\partial (w_b+w_s)}{\\partial x} = \\dfrac{\\partial w_s}{\\partial x}$ and similarly $\\gamma_{yz} = \\dfrac{\\partial w_s}{\\partial y}$.\nThe shear forces are thus $Q_x = \\kappa G h \\dfrac{\\partial w_s}{\\partial x}$ and $Q_y = \\kappa G h \\dfrac{\\partial w_s}{\\partial y}$.\n\nFrom classical theory, the shear force is also related to the moments, which are in turn related to the bending deflection $w_b$. This leads to $Q_x = -D \\dfrac{\\partial}{\\partial x}(\\nabla^2 w_b)$ and $Q_y = -D \\dfrac{\\partial}{\\partial y}(\\nabla^2 w_b)$, where $\\nabla^2 = \\dfrac{\\partial^2}{\\partial x^2} + \\dfrac{\\partial^2}{\\partial y^2}$.\n\nEquating the two expressions for shear force, we find a key relation:\n$$ \\kappa G h \\frac{\\partial w_s}{\\partial x} = -D \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}(\\nabla^2 w_b) \\implies w_s = -\\frac{D}{\\kappa G h} \\nabla^2 w_b $$\nNow, the third equilibrium equation (force balance in the transverse direction) is:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial Q_x}{\\partial x} + \\frac{\\partial Q_y}{\\partial y} + N_x \\frac{\\partial^2 w}{\\partial x^2} = 0 $$\nSubstituting $Q_x = -D \\dfrac{\\partial}{\\partial x}(\\nabla^2 w_b)$ and $Q_y = -D \\dfrac{\\partial}{\\partial y}(\\nabla^2 w_b)$:\n$$ -D \\nabla^2(\\nabla^2 w_b) + N_x \\frac{\\partial^2 w}{\\partial x^2} = 0 \\implies D \\nabla^4 w_b - N_x \\frac{\\partial^2 w}{\\partial x^2} = 0 $$\nWe have a system of two equations for $w$ and $w_b$:\n(I) $w = w_b + w_s = w_b - \\dfrac{D}{\\kappa G h} \\nabla^2 w_b$\n(II) $D \\nabla^4 w_b - N_x \\dfrac{\\partial^2 w}{\\partial x^2} = 0$\n\nFor a simply supported plate, the problem states to use a single-term Ritz approximation, which happens to be the exact solution for this boundary condition:\n$$ w(x,y) = W_{mn} \\sin(k_x x) \\sin(k_y y) $$\nwhere $k_x = \\frac{m\\pi}{a}$ and $k_y = \\frac{n\\pi}{b}$. Let us assume a similar form for the bending deflection:\n$$ w_b(x,y) = W_{b,mn} \\sin(k_x x) \\sin(k_y y) $$\nSubstituting these forms into equation (I):\n$$ W_{mn} \\sin(k_x x) \\sin(k_y y) = W_{b,mn} \\sin(k_x x) \\sin(k_y y) - \\frac{D}{\\kappa G h} W_{b,mn} (-(k_x^2+k_y^2)) \\sin(k_x x) \\sin(k_y y) $$\n$$ W_{mn} = W_{b,mn} \\left[ 1 + \\frac{D(k_x^2+k_y^2)}{\\kappa G h} \\right] $$\nNow, substituting the forms for $w$ and $w_b$ into equation (II):\n$$ D W_{b,mn} (k_x^2+k_y^2)^2 \\sin(k_x x) \\sin(k_y y) - N_x W_{mn} (-k_x^2) \\sin(k_x x) \\sin(k_y y) = 0 $$\nFor a non-trivial solution ($W_{mn} \\neq 0, W_{b,mn} \\neq 0$):\n$$ D W_{b,mn} (k_x^2+k_y^2)^2 = N_x W_{mn} k_x^2 $$\nNow we substitute the expression for $W_{mn}$ in terms of $W_{b,mn}$:\n$$ D W_{b,mn} (k_x^2+k_y^2)^2 = N_x \\left( W_{b,mn} \\left[ 1 + \\frac{D(k_x^2+k_y^2)}{\\kappa G h} \\right] \\right) k_x^2 $$\nWe cancel the non-zero amplitude $W_{b,mn}$ and solve for the critical load $N_x = N_{x,\\mathrm{cr}}$:\n$$ N_{x,\\mathrm{cr}} = \\frac{D (k_x^2+k_y^2)^2}{k_x^2 \\left[ 1 + \\frac{D(k_x^2+k_y^2)}{\\kappa G h} \\right]} $$\nThis is the required expression for the linear buckling load. The term in the numerator, $\\dfrac{D (k_x^2+k_y^2)^2}{k_x^2}$, is the classical buckling load from Kirchhoff–Love theory, $N_{x,\\mathrm{cr}}^{\\mathrm{KL}}$.\n\n**Qualitative Analysis:**\n1.  **Effect of shear deformation**: The denominator contains the term $1 + \\frac{D(k_x^2+k_y^2)}{\\kappa G h}$. Since all quantities are positive, this term is strictly greater than $1$. Therefore, $N_{x,\\mathrm{cr}}  N_{x,\\mathrm{cr}}^{\\mathrm{KL}}$. Shear deformation provides an additional mechanism for the plate to deform, increasing its flexibility and thus *reducing* the critical buckling load.\n\n2.  **Effect of plate thickness $h$**: The correction term in the denominator is proportional to $h^2$ (since $D \\propto h^3$). As the thickness $h$ increases, the correction term grows, making the denominator larger and the critical load $N_{x,\\mathrm{cr}}$ smaller.\n\n3.  **Thin plate limit ($h \\to 0$)**: As $h \\to 0$, the correction term $\\propto h^2 \\to 0$. The denominator approaches $1$, and thus $N_{x,\\mathrm{cr}} \\to N_{x,\\mathrm{cr}}^{\\mathrm{KL}}$. The Mindlin theory correctly recovers the classical result in the thin plate limit.\n\n4.  **Effect of mode number ($m, n$)**: The correction term is proportional to $k_x^2+k_y^2$. For higher mode numbers (larger $m$ or $n$), this term increases, signifying that the reduction in buckling load due to shear is greater for higher buckling modes.\n\n**Option Analysis:**\n- **A:** The formula is identical to the one derived. The qualitative description matches the analysis perfectly: reduction of load, stronger effect for larger $h$ and higher modes, and correct thin-plate limit. This is the correct option.\n- **B:** The formula is incorrect (multiplication instead of division) and the physical reasoning is flawed (shear increases flexibility, not stiffness).\n- **C:** This formula is a first-order Taylor expansion approximation and is not the exact derived result. It can lead to unphysical negative loads.\n- **D:** The formula inverts the correction term, leading to an incorrect physical dependency on thickness $h$.\n\nTherefore, option A is the only correct choice.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2909821"}]}
