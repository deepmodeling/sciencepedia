The problem is self-contained and free of contradictions or scientifically unsound premises.\n\nStep 3: Verdict\nThe problem is valid. A complete solution will be derived and implemented.\n\nThe objective is to derive the expressions for the tip deflections $v(L)$ and $w(L)$ using two distinct methods based on the provided fundamental principles.\n\nFirst, we establish the constitutive relationship between bending moments and curvatures, which is common to both methods. The axial stress $\\sigma_x$ is given by Hooke's law, $\\sigma_x = E \\varepsilon_x$. Using the given strain-curvature relation:\n$$\n\\sigma_x(x,y,z) = E(-z\\kappa_y(x) + y\\kappa_z(x))\n$$\nThe bending moments $M_y$ and $M_z$ are defined as integrals of stress over the cross-sectional area $A$:\n$$\nM_y(x) = \\int_A -z \\sigma_x dA = \\int_A -z E(-z\\kappa_y + y\\kappa_z) dA = E \\left(\\kappa_y \\int_A z^2 dA - \\kappa_z \\int_A yz dA\\right)\n$$\n$$\nM_z(x) = \\int_A y \\sigma_x dA = \\int_A y E(-z\\kappa_y + y\\kappa_z) dA = E \\left(\\kappa_z \\int_A y^2 dA - \\kappa_y \\int_A yz dA\\right)\n$$\nSubstituting the definitions of moments of inertia, we obtain the coupled moment-curvature relations in matrix form:\n$$\n\\begin{pmatrix} M_y \\\\ M_z \\end{pmatrix} = E \\begin{pmatrix} I_y & -I_{yz} \\\\ -I_{yz} & I_z \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} \\kappa_y \\\\ \\kappa_z \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThis relationship is fundamental to the mechanics of unsymmetric bending.\n\nMethod A: Castigliano's Second Theorem\nCastigliano's theorem states that the displacement at the point of application of a force, in the direction of that force, is the partial derivative of the total strain energy with respect to the force. First, we must express the total strain energy $U$ as a function of the applied forces $P_y$ and $P_z$.\n\nThe strain energy density per unit length, $u(x)$, is given. We will express it in terms of moments. To do this, we invert the moment-curvature relationship to solve for the curvatures $\\kappa_y$ and $\\kappa_z$:\n$$\n\\begin{pmatrix} \\kappa_y \\\\ \\kappa_z \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{1}{E(I_y I_z - I_{yz}^2)} \\begin{pmatrix} I_z & I_{yz} \\\\ I_{yz} & I_y \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} M_y \\\\ M_z \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{1}{E\\Delta} \\begin{pmatrix} I_z M_y + I_{yz} M_z \\\\ I_{yz} M_y + I_y M_z \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nFor a linear elastic material, the strain energy density can be written as $u(x) = \\frac{1}{2}(M_y \\kappa_y + M_z \\kappa_z)$. Substituting the expressions for $\\kappa_y$ and $\\kappa_z$:\n$$\nu(x) = \\frac{1}{2E\\Delta} [M_y(I_z M_y + I_{yz} M_z) + M_z(I_{yz} M_y + I_y M_z)]\n$$\n$$\nu(x) = \\frac{1}{2E\\Delta} (I_z M_y^2 + 2I_{yz} M_y M_z + I_y M_z^2)\n$$\nThe total strain energy $U$ is the integral of $u(x)$ along the beam's length $L$. We use the given internal moment distributions: $M_y(x) = P_z(L-x)$ and $M_z(x) = P_y(L-x)$.\n$$\nU = \\int_0^L u(x) dx = \\frac{1}{2E\\Delta} \\int_0^L [I_z (P_z(L-x))^2 + 2I_{yz}(P_z(L-x))(P_y(L-x)) + I_y(P_y(L-x))^2] dx\n$$\n$$\nU = \\frac{I_y P_y^2 + 2I_{yz} P_y P_z + I_z P_z^2}{2E\\Delta} \\int_0^L (L-x)^2 dx\n$$\nThe integral evaluates to $\\int_0^L (L-x)^2 dx = [-\\frac{(L-x)^3}{3}]_0^L = \\frac{L^3}{3}$.\nThus, the total strain energy is:\n$$\nU(P_y, P_z) = \\frac{L^3}{6E\\Delta} (I_y P_y^2 + 2I_{yz} P_y P_z + I_z P_z^2)\n$$\nThe tip deflections $v(L)$ and $w(L)$ are found by applying Castigliano's theorem:\n$$\nv_A(L) = \\frac{\\partial U}{\\partial P_y} = \\frac{L^3}{6E\\Delta} (2I_y P_y + 2I_{yz} P_z) = \\frac{L^3}{3E\\Delta} (I_y P_y + I_{yz} P_z)\n$$\n$$\nw_A(L) = \\frac{\\partial U}{\\partial P_z} = \\frac{L^3}{6E\\Delta} (2I_{yz} P_y + 2I_z P_z) = \\frac{L^3}{3E\\Delta} (I_{yz} P_y + I_z P_z)\n$$\nThese are the final expressions for the tip deflections via Method A.\n\nMethod B: Direct Integration of the Governing Equations\nThis method involves solving the differential equations for the deflection curves $v(x)$ and $w(x)$. We must first relate the curvatures $\\kappa_y, \\kappa_z$ to the derivatives of the deflection. The curvature vector for the deflected beam centerline $\\vec{r}(x) = x\\hat{i} + v(x)\\hat{j} + w(x)\\hat{k}$ is $\\vec{\\kappa}(x) \\approx v''(x)\\hat{j} + w''(x)\\hat{k}$. By convention, $\\kappa_y$ describes bending in the $x-z$ plane (curvature \"about the $y$-axis\"), which corresponds to $w''(x)$, and $\\kappa_z$ describes bending in the $x-y$ plane (curvature \"about the $z$-axis\"), corresponding to $v''(x)$. Thus, the kinematic assumption is $\\kappa_y = w''(x)$ and $\\kappa_z = v''(x)$. This interpretation is necessary for consistency with the provided strain definition $\\varepsilon_x = -z\\kappa_y + y\\kappa_z = -zw'' + yv''$ and the final result.\n\nWe substitute these kinematic relations into the moment-curvature expressions derived earlier:\n$$\n\\begin{pmatrix} M_y \\\\ M_z \\end{pmatrix} = E \\begin{pmatrix} I_y & -I_{yz} \\\\ -I_{yz} & I_z \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} w'' \\\\ v'' \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nTo find the differential equations for $v(x)$ and $w(x)$, we invert this system to solve for $v''$ and $w''$:\n$$\n\\begin{pmatrix} v'' \\\\ w'' \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{1}{E(I_y I_z - I_{yz}^2)} \\begin{pmatrix} I_{yz} & I_y \\\\ I_z & I_{yz} \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} M_y \\\\ M_z \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThis gives two uncoupled ordinary differential equations for $v''$ and $w''$:\n$$\nE\\Delta v''(x) = I_{yz} M_y(x) + I_y M_z(x)\n$$\n$$\nE\\Delta w''(x) = I_z M_y(x) + I_{yz} M_z(x)\n$$\nSubstituting the provided moment expressions $M_y(x) = P_z(L-x)$ and $M_z(x) = P_y(L-x)$:\n$$\nE\\Delta v''(x) = (I_{yz} P_z + I_y P_y)(L-x)\n$$\n$$\nE\\Delta w''(x) = (I_z P_z + I_{yz} P_y)(L-x)\n$$\nLet the constants be $C_v = (I_y P_y + I_{yz} P_z)$ and $C_w = (I_{yz} P_y + I_z P_z)$. We integrate twice and apply the cantilever boundary conditions.\nFirst integration for the slope, applying $v'(0)=0, w'(0)=0$:\n$$\nE\\Delta v'(x) = \\int_0^x C_v(L-\\xi)d\\xi = C_v \\left(Lx - \\frac{x^2}{2}\\right)\n$$\n$$\nE\\Delta w'(x) = \\int_0^x C_w(L-\\xi)d\\xi = C_w \\left(Lx - \\frac{x^2}{2}\\right)\n$$\nSecond integration for the deflection, applying $v(0)=0, w(0)=0$:\n$$\nE\\Delta v(x) = \\int_0^x C_v \\left(L\\xi - \\frac{\\xi^2}{2}\\right)d\\xi = C_v \\left(L\\frac{x^2}{2} - \\frac{x^3}{6}\\right)\n$$\n$$\nE\\Delta w(x) = \\int_0^x C_w \\left(L\\xi - \\frac{\\xi^2}{2}\\right)d\\xi = C_w \\left(L\\frac{x^2}{2} - \\frac{x^3}{6}\\right)\n$$\nFinally, we evaluate the deflections at the free end, $x=L$:\n$$\nv_B(L) = \\frac{C_v}{E\\Delta} \\left(\\frac{L^3}{2} - \\frac{L^3}{6}\\right) = \\frac{C_v L^3}{3E\\Delta} = \\frac{L^3}{3E\\Delta} (I_y P_y + I_{yz} P_z)\n$$\n$$\nw_B(L) = \\frac{C_w}{E\\Delta} \\left(\\frac{L^3}{2} - \\frac{L^3}{6}\\right) = \\frac{C_w L^3}{3E\\Delta} = \\frac{L^3}{3E\\Delta} (I_{yz} P_y + I_z P_z)\n$$\nThese are the final expressions for the tip deflections via Method B.\n\nConclusion\nThe analytical expressions for the tip deflections derived from Method A (Castigliano's theorem) and Method B (direct integration) are identical:\n$$\nv(L) = \\frac{L^3}{3E(I_y I_z - I_{yz}^2)}(I_y P_y + I_{yz} P_z)\n$$\n$$\nw(L) = \\frac{L^3}{3E(I_y I_z - I_{yz}^2)}(I_{yz} P_y + I_z P_z)\n$$\nThe computational experiment is thus a numerical confirmation of this analytical identity. As the formulas are the same, their implementation will produce numerically identical results, well within any reasonable tolerance, assuming no errors in implementation.
