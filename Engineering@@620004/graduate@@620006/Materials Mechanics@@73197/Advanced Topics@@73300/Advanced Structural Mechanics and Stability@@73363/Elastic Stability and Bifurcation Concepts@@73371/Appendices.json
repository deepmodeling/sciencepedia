The problem is well-posed, providing all necessary information and definitions to derive a unique solution without ambiguity or contradiction. It is an objective problem stated with formal precision. We may proceed with the solution.\n\nThe solution is derived by following the steps outlined in the problem statement.\n\nFirst, we compute the total bending strain energy $U_b$. The assumed deflection is $w(x) = q \\sin\\left(\\frac{\\pi x}{L}\\right)$. We require its second derivative with respect to $x$:\n$$\nw'(x) = q \\frac{\\pi}{L} \\cos\\left(\\frac{\\pi x}{L}\\right)\n$$\n$$\nw''(x) = -q \\left(\\frac{\\pi}{L}\\right)^{2} \\sin\\left(\\frac{\\pi x}{L}\\right)\n$$\nThe square of the second derivative is:\n$$\n[w''(x)]^2 = q^2 \\left(\\frac{\\pi}{L}\\right)^{4} \\sin^{2}\\left(\\frac{\\pi x}{L}\\right)\n$$\nThe total bending strain energy $U_b$ is obtained by integrating over the length of the rod:\n$$\nU_b = \\frac{EI}{2} \\int_{0}^{L} q^2 \\left(\\frac{\\pi}{L}\\right)^{4} \\sin^{2}\\left(\\frac{\\pi x}{L}\\right) \\mathrm{d}x = \\frac{EI q^2 \\pi^4}{2L^4} \\int_{0}^{L} \\sin^{2}\\left(\\frac{\\pi x}{L}\\right) \\mathrm{d}x\n$$\nThe integral evaluates to $\\int_{0}^{L} \\sin^{2}\\left(\\frac{\\pi x}{L}\\right) \\mathrm{d}x = \\frac{L}{2}$. Substituting this result gives:\n$$\nU_b = \\frac{EI q^2 \\pi^4}{2L^4} \\left(\\frac{L}{2}\\right) = \\frac{EI \\pi^4}{4L^3} q^2\n$$\n\nSecond, we compute the potential $W$ of the external load $P$. This requires the calculation of the end-shortening $\\delta$. We use the provided formula for $\\delta$, which requires integrals of $[w'(x)]^2$ and $[w'(x)]^4$.\nThe square of the first derivative is $[w'(x)]^2 = q^2 \\left(\\frac{\\pi}{L}\\right)^{2} \\cos^{2}\\left(\\frac{\\pi x}{L}\\right)$. Its integral is:\n$$\n\\int_{0}^{L} [w'(x)]^2 \\mathrm{d}x = q^2 \\left(\\frac{\\pi}{L}\\right)^{2} \\int_{0}^{L} \\cos^{2}\\left(\\frac{\\pi x}{L}\\right) \\mathrm{d}x = q^2 \\frac{\\pi^2}{L^2} \\left(\\frac{L}{2}\\right) = \\frac{q^2 \\pi^2}{2L}\n$$\nThe fourth power of the first derivative is $[w'(x)]^4 = q^4 \\left(\\frac{\\pi}{L}\\right)^{4} \\cos^{4}\\left(\\frac{\\pi x}{L}\\right)$.

Nontrivial solutions $q \\neq 0$ exist when the term in the brackets can be zero.\n\nFourth, we analyze the stability of the trivial solution $q=0$. Stability requires that $\\Pi(q)$ be a local minimum at $q=0$, which implies $\\frac{\\partial^2 \\Pi}{\\partial q^2}\\big|_{q=0} > 0$.\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial^2 \\Pi}{\\partial q^2} = \\frac{\\pi^2}{2L} \\left( \\frac{EI\\pi^2}{L^2} - P \\right) + \\frac{9P\\pi^4}{16L^3} q^2\n$$\nEvaluating at $q=0$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial^2 \\Pi}{\\partial q^2}\\bigg|_{q=0} = \\frac{\\pi^2}{2L} \\left( \\frac{EI\\pi^2}{L^2} - P \\right)\n$$\nThe trivial solution is stable when $\\frac{EI\\pi^2}{L^2} - P > 0$, or $P < \\frac{EI\\pi^2}{L^2}$. The solution loses stability when the second derivative vanishes. This defines the critical load, $P_{cr}$:\n$$\n\\frac{EI\\pi^2}{L^2} - P_{cr} = 0 \\implies P_{cr} = \\frac{\\pi^2 EI}{L^2}\n$$\nThis value is the Euler buckling load. The point $(P, q) = (P_{cr}, 0)$ is the bifurcation point.\nTo determine the type of pitchfork bifurcation, we examine the sign of the coefficient of the $q^4$ term in $\\Pi(q)$ at $P=P_{cr}$:\n$$\nc_4 = \\frac{3P\\pi^4}{64L^3}\n$$\nAt $P=P_{cr}$, this coefficient is:\n$$\nc_4(P_{cr}) = \\frac{3P_{cr}\\pi^4}{64L^3} = \\frac{3\\left(\\frac{\\pi^2 EI}{L^2}\\right)\\pi^4}{64L^3} = \\frac{3\\pi^6 EI}{64L^5}\n$$\nSince $E$, $I$, and $L$ are positive, $c_4(P_{cr}) > 0$. A positive quartic coefficient indicates a stable, supercritical pitchfork bifurcation.\n\nFinally, we compute the nondimensional critical load parameter $\\Lambda$:\n$$\n\\Lambda = \\frac{P_{cr}L^2}{EI} = \\frac{\\left(\\frac{\\pi^2 EI}{L^2}\\right)L^2}{EI} = \\pi^2\n$$\nThis result is exact because the chosen trial function $w(x) = q\\sin(\\pi x/L)$ corresponds to the exact first buckling mode shape of a pin-ended column.", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{\\pi^2} $$", "id": "2881572"}, {"introduction": "Building upon the continuous model, this practice transitions our analysis to a discretized framework, which mirrors the approach used in powerful computational tools like the Finite Element Method.

It is scientifically grounded in the principles of structural mechanics, specifically elastic stability theory, and is mathematically well-posed. All necessary data and conditions are provided.\n\nThe total potential energy, $\\Pi$, of a conservative elastic system under a compressive axial load $P$ can be expressed as a function of the vector of generalized displacements, $q$. The energy consists of the elastic strain energy, $U$, and the potential of the applied load, $V$. For a linear system undergoing small displacements, these are given by quadratic forms:\n$$ U = \\frac{1}{2} q^T K q $$\n$$ V = -\\frac{1}{2} P q^T K_g q $$\nwhere $K$ is the elastic stiffness matrix and $K_g$ is the geometric stiffness matrix per unit axial load. The total potential energy is thus:\n$$ \\Pi(q) = U + V = \\frac{1}{2} q^T K q - \\frac{1}{2} P q^T K_g q = \\frac{1}{2} q^T (K - P K_g) q $$\n\nAccording to the principle of stationary potential energy, an equilibrium configuration must correspond to a stationary value of $\\Pi$.

A non-trivial solution ($q \\neq 0$), representing a buckled configuration, can exist only if the matrix $(K - P K_g)$ is singular. This condition marks a point of bifurcation.\n\nThe stability of an equilibrium state is governed by the second variation of the total potential energy. For the trivial equilibrium state $q=0$ to be stable, it must correspond to a local minimum of $\\Pi$. This requires the Hessian matrix of $\\Pi$, evaluated at $q=0$, to be positive definite. This Hessian is the tangent stiffness matrix, $K_T$:\n$$ K_T(P) = \\frac{\\partial^2 \\Pi}{\\partial q_i \\partial q_j} = K - P K_g $$\nThe system is stable as long as $K_T(P)$ is positive definite.\n\nThe onset of buckling corresponds to the loss of stability of the trivial equilibrium path. This occurs at the critical load $P=P_{cr}$ where the tangent stiffness matrix $K_T(P)$ ceases to be positive definite. The limiting condition is when $K_T(P)$ becomes positive semi-definite, which implies that it becomes singular. The algebraic condition for determining the critical loads is therefore:\n$$ \\det(K_T(P)) = \\det(K - P K_g) = 0 $$\nThis equation represents a generalized eigenvalue problem, $Kq = P K_g q$, where the eigenvalues are the critical loads $P$ and the eigenvectors $q$ are the corresponding buckling mode shapes.\n\nWe are given the matrices:\n$$ K = 3.6 \\begin{bmatrix} 2 & -1 \\\\ -1 & 2 \\end{bmatrix} \\, \\text{kN/m} $$\n$$ K_g = 0.12 \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{bmatrix} \\, \\text{m}^{-1} $$\nFor consistency of units, the load $P$ must be in kilonewtons (kN).

At such a point, the stiffness of the system vanishes. The stiffness is given by the second derivative of the potential energy.

In this limit, the equilibrium path of the imperfect structure approaches that of the perfect one, and the limit point amplitude $a_L$ must also become small. For small $a_L$, the term $-4c a_L^5$ is of a higher order than the term $2b a_L^3$.
