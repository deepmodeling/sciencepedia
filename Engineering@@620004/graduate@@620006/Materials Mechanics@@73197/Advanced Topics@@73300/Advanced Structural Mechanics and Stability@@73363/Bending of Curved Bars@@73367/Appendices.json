It presents a standard problem in the mechanics of materials concerning the analysis of a curved bar subjected to pure bending. The provided assumptions, such as plane sections remaining plane and the negligence of radial stress, are consistent with the classical Winkler-Bach theory for curved beams. The givens are sufficient and consistent for deriving the requested expression and performing the subsequent numerical calculation. Therefore, the problem is valid, and we proceed with the solution.\n\nThe derivation of the circumferential normal stress $\\sigma_{\\theta}(r)$ proceeds from first principles as follows.\n\n1.  **Kinematics and Strain Distribution**:\n    The fundamental kinematic assumption for a curved bar in pure bending is that plane cross-sections, initially radial, remain plane after deformation and rotate about a neutral axis. Let the initial angle between two adjacent cross-sections be $d\\theta$. A fiber at a generic radius $r$ has an initial length $ds = r \\, d\\theta$. The neutral axis, at which strain is zero, is located at a radius $R_n$. After bending, the angle between the cross-sections changes by an amount $\\Delta(d\\theta)$. The elongation of the fiber at radius $r$ is proportional to its distance from the neutral axis, given by $(r-R_n) \\Delta(d\\theta)$.\n\n    The circumferential strain, $\\epsilon_{\\theta}(r)$, is the ratio of the elongation to the original length:\n    $$ \\epsilon_{\\theta}(r) = \\frac{(r-R_n) \\Delta(d\\theta)}{r \\, d\\theta} $$\n    For pure bending, the relative rotation $\\frac{\\Delta(d\\theta)}{d\\theta}$ is constant along the bar. Let us denote this constant by $k$. The strain distribution is then:\n    $$ \\epsilon_{\\theta}(r) = k \\frac{r-R_n}{r} $$\n    This equation shows that the strain distribution across the depth of a curved bar is not linear, but hyperbolic.\n\n2.  **Constitutive Relation and Stress Distribution**:\n    The material is linear elastic. Under the given assumptions of plane stress and negligible radial stress ($\\sigma_r \\approx 0$), the circumferential (hoop) stress $\\sigma_{\\theta}$ is related to the circumferential strain $\\epsilon_{\\theta}$ by Hooke's Law:\n    $$ \\sigma_{\\theta}(r) = E \\epsilon_{\\theta}(r) $$\n    where $E$ is the Young's modulus of the material. Substituting the expression for strain, we obtain the stress distribution as a function of the unknown constants $k$ and $R_n$:\n    $$ \\sigma_{\\theta}(r) = E k \\frac{r-R_n}{r} $$\n\n3.  **Equilibrium Conditions**:\n    The two unknown constants, $R_n$ and $k$, are determined from the static equilibrium conditions for the cross-section.\n\n    a) **Force Equilibrium**: For pure bending, the net axial force on the cross-section must be zero.\n    $$ F = \\int_A \\sigma_{\\theta}(r) \\, dA = 0 $$\n    The differential area element for the rectangular cross-section is $dA = b \\, dr$.\n    $$ \\int_{r_i}^{r_o} \\left( E k \\frac{r-R_n}{r} \\right) b \\, dr = 0 $$\n    Since $E$, $k$, and $b$ are non-zero constants, the integral must be zero:\n    $$ \\int_{r_i}^{r_o} \\left(1 - \\frac{R_n}{r}\\right) dr = 0 $$\n    $$ [r - R_n \\ln|r|]_{r_i}^{r_o} = (r_o - r_i) - R_n(\\ln r_o - \\ln r_i) = 0 $$\n    Solving for $R_n$, the radius of the neutral axis, we find:\n    $$ R_n = \\frac{r_o - r_i}{\\ln(r_o/r_i)} $$\n    The location of the neutral axis depends only on the geometry of the cross-section.\n\n    b) **Moment Equilibrium**: The internal resisting moment must be equal to the externally applied moment $M$. Since the resultant force on the cross-section is zero, the moment is the same about any point in the plane. It is convenient to calculate the moment about the center of curvature, $O$.\n    $$ M = \\int_A \\sigma_{\\theta}(r) \\cdot r \\, dA $$\n    $$ M = \\int_{r_i}^{r_o} \\left( E k \\frac{r-R_n}{r} \\right) r \\, (b \\, dr) = E k b \\int_{r_i}^{r_o} (r - R_n) \\, dr $$\n    $$ M = E k b \\left[ \\frac{r^2}{2} - R_n r \\right]_{r_i}^{r_o} = E k b \\left( \\frac{r_o^2 - r_i^2}{2} - R_n (r_o - r_i) \\right) $$\n    $$ M = E k b (r_o - r_i) \\left( \\frac{r_o + r_i}{2} - R_n \\right) $$\n    We recognize the cross-sectional area $A = b(r_o - r_i)$ and the radius of the centroidal axis $R_c = \\frac{r_i+r_o}{2}$. The equation becomes:\n    $$ M = E k A (R_c - R_n) $$\n    The difference $e = R_c - R_n$ is known as the eccentricity of the neutral axis. Thus, we can solve for the term $Ek$:\n    $$ E k = \\frac{M}{A e} $$\n\n4.  **Final Expression for Circumferential Stress**:\n    Substituting the expression for $Ek$ back into the stress distribution equation gives the final closed-form expression for the circumferential normal stress:\n    $$ \\sigma_{\\theta}(r) = \\frac{M}{A e} \\frac{r-R_n}{r} $$\n    where the geometric parameters are defined as:\n    -   Area: $A = b(r_o - r_i)$\n    -   Centroidal Radius: $R_c = \\frac{r_i + r_o}{2}$\n    -   Neutral Axis Radius: $R_n = \\frac{r_o - r_i}{\\ln(r_o/r_i)}$\n    -   Eccentricity: $e = R_c - R_n$\n    This formula expresses $\\sigma_{\\theta}(r)$ as a function of $M$, $r$, and the geometric properties $r_i$, $r_o$, and $b$.\n\n5.  **Numerical Evaluation**:\n    We are asked to evaluate the stress at the inner surface, $r=r_i$, for the given data.

It is self-contained, with all necessary data and definitions provided, and is free of contradictions, ambiguities, or factual inaccuracies. The task is to compare the predictions of two standard beam theories, which is a classical exercise in solid mechanics. We may therefore proceed with the derivation of a solution.\n\nThe objective is to compute the relative error $\\varepsilon$ between the normal stress at the inner fiber ($r = r_i$) predicted by straight-beam theory and curved-beam theory for a specified geometry.

The cross-section is a rectangle of width $b$ and height $h = r_o - r_i$. For a straight beam, the neutral axis coincides with the centroidal axis. The centroidal radius is given as $\\bar{r} = (r_i + r_o)/2$.

For a rectangular curved section, one can verify that\n$$\n\\frac{1}{r_n} = \\frac{1}{A}\\int_A \\frac{1}{r}\\,\\mathrm{d}A = \\frac{\\ln(r_o/r_i)}{r_o - r_i},\n$$\nso that $r_n = \\frac{r_o - r_i}{\\ln(r_o/r_i)}$. This shows $r_n > r_i$ because for $x = r_o/r_i > 1$, one has $\\ln x  x - 1$, implying $\\frac{x-1}{\\ln x} > 1$, hence $r_n/r_i > 1$. Therefore, under a positive bending moment that increases curvature, the inner fiber goes into compression first.\n\nNext, apply the moment equilibrium:\n$$\n\\int_A \\sigma_{\\theta}(r)\\, r \\,\\mathrm{d}A = E C_1 \\left( \\int_A 1\\, \\mathrm{d}A - \\frac{1}{r_n}\\int_A r\\, \\mathrm{d}A \\right) = M.\n$$\nSince $\\int_A 1\\, \\mathrm{d}A = A$ and $\\int_A r \\,\\mathrm{d}A = A r_c$, where $r_c$ is the centroidal radius of the section, we obtain\n$$\nE C_1 \\left( A - \\frac{A r_c}{r_n} \\right) = M \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad C_1 = \\frac{M}{E A \\left(1 - \\frac{r_c}{r_n}\\right)}.\n$$\nDefine the eccentricity $e$ as $e = r_c - r_n$. Then\n$$\n1 - \\frac{r_c}{r_n} = 1 - \\frac{r_n + e}{r_n} = -\\frac{e}{r_n}.\n$$\nTherefore,\n$$\nC_1 = -\\,\\frac{M r_n}{E A e}.\n$$\nUsing $C_2 = - C_1 / r_n$, we find\n$$\nC_2 = \\frac{M}{E A e}.\n$$\nHence, the circumferential strain and stress distributions become\n$$\n\\varepsilon_{\\theta}(r) = \\frac{M}{E A e}\\left( 1 - \\frac{r_n}{r} \\right), \\qquad\n\\sigma_{\\theta}(r) = E \\varepsilon_{\\theta}(r) = \\frac{M}{A e}\\left( 1 - \\frac{r_n}{r} \\right).\n$$\n\nEvaluate the extreme fiber stresses at $r = r_i$ (inner) and $r = r_o$ (outer):\n$$\n\\sigma_{\\theta}(r_i) = \\frac{M}{A e}\\left( 1 - \\frac{r_n}{r_i} \\right), \n\\qquad\n\\sigma_{\\theta}(r_o) = \\frac{M}{A e}\\left( 1 - \\frac{r_n}{r_o} \\right).\n$$\nSince $r_n > r_i$ for the rectangular curved section, the factor $\\left(1 - \\frac{r_n}{r_i}\\right)$ is negative, so the inner fiber is in compression under positive $M$. Moreover, $|\\sigma_{\\theta}(r_i)| > |\\sigma_{\\theta}(r_o)|$ because $\\left|\\frac{r_n}{r_i} - 1\\right| > \\left|1 - \\frac{r_n}{r_o}\\right|$ for $r_i  r_n  r_o$. Therefore, first yield occurs at the inner fiber when the compressive stress there reaches magnitude $\\sigma_y$:\n$$\n-\\sigma_y = \\sigma_{\\theta}(r_i) = \\frac{M_y}{A e}\\left( 1 - \\frac{r_n}{r_i} \\right).\n$$\nSolving for $M_y$ gives\n$$\nM_y = \\sigma_y A e \\,\\frac{r_i}{r_n - r_i}.\n$$\nThis expression is positive because $r_n > r_i$ and $e > 0$ for typical rectangular curved sections, consistent with the adopted sign convention that $M_y > 0$ increases curvature and causes inner-fiber compression.\n\nEquivalently, one may write\n$$\nM_y = \\frac{\\sigma_y A e}{\\frac{r_n}{r_i} - 1},\n$$\nwhich is algebraically the same result. The requested form in terms of $\\sigma_y$, $r_i$, $r_n$, $e$, and $A$ is thus established.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\sigma_y A e \\,\\frac{r_i}{r_n - r_i}}$$", "id": "2868166"}]}
