We first seek to find the value of $n$ that minimizes $N_{x,cr}$ for any given $m \\in \\mathbb{N}$ and aspect ratio $\\beta > 0$.\nThe expression for $N_{x,cr}(m,n)$ is:\n$$ N_{x,cr}(m,n) = D \\dfrac{\\pi^2}{b^2} \\left(\\dfrac{m}{\\beta} + \\dfrac{n^2 \\beta}{m}\\right)^2 $$\nThe term $D \\pi^2 / b^2$ is a positive constant. Minimizing $N_{x,cr}(m,n)$ is equivalent to minimizing the squared term, or its positive base:\n$$ f(n) = \\dfrac{m}{\\beta} + \\dfrac{n^2 \\beta}{m} $$\nFor fixed $m$ and $\\beta$, the terms $m/\\beta$ and $\\beta/m$ are positive constants. The function $f(n)$ is a simple quadratic in $n$, of the form $C_1 + C_2 n^2$ where $C_2 = \\beta/m > 0$. This function is strictly increasing for $n > 0$. Since the domain for $n$ is the set of positive integers $\\mathbb{N} = \\{1, 2, 3, \\dots\\}$, the minimum value of $f(n)$ is attained at the smallest possible integer value of $n$, which is $n=1$.\nThus, for any $m$ and $\\beta$, the buckling load is minimized when $n=1$. The plate buckles into a single half-sine wave in the transverse direction.\n\n**Task 3: Minimizing Pair for $\\beta_0 = 2.3$**\n\nFrom Task 2, we know the minimizing mode will have $n^{\\star}=1$. We now need to find the integer $m^{\\star}$ that minimizes $N_{x,cr}(m,1)$ for $\\beta = \\beta_0 = 2.3$.\n$$ N_{x,cr}(m,1) = D \\dfrac{\\pi^2}{b^2} \\left(\\dfrac{m}{\\beta} + \\dfrac{\\beta}{m}\\right)^2 $$\nWe must minimize the buckling coefficient factor $g(m, \\beta) = \\dfrac{m}{\\beta} + \\dfrac{\\beta}{m}$ with respect to $m \\in \\mathbb{N}$.\nTo find the approximate location of the minimum, we treat $m$ as a continuous positive real variable and find the derivative with respect to $m$:\n$$ \\dfrac{d g}{d m} = \\dfrac{1}{\\beta} - \\dfrac{\\beta}{m^2} $$\nSetting the derivative to zero gives $m^2 = \\beta^2$, so $m=\\beta$. The second derivative $\\dfrac{d^2 g}{d m^2} = \\dfrac{2\\beta}{m^3} > 0$, confirming this is a minimum.\nThe integer $m^{\\star}$ that minimizes $g(m,\\beta)$ must be one of the two integers bracketing the real-valued minimum $m=\\beta$.\nFor $\\beta_0 = 2.3$, the continuous minimum occurs at $m=2.3$. The candidate integers are $m=2$ and $m=3$. We compare the values of $g(m, 2.3)$ for these two integers:\nFor $m=2$:\n$$ g(2, 2.3) = \\dfrac{2}{2.3} + \\dfrac{2.3}{2} \\approx 0.8696 + 1.15 = 2.0196 $$\nFor $m=3$:\n$$ g(3, 2.3) = \\dfrac{3}{2.3} + \\dfrac{2.3}{3} \\approx 1.3043 + 0.7667 = 2.0710 $$\nSince $g(2, 2.3) < g(3, 2.3)$, the minimum occurs at $m^{\\star}=2$.\nTherefore, for an aspect ratio of $\\beta_0 = 2.3$, the minimizing mode pair is $(m^{\\star},n^{\\star})=(2,1)$.\n\n**Task 4: Derivation of Transition Aspect Ratio $\\beta_t(m)$**\n\nAs the aspect ratio $\\beta$ increases, the optimal number of longitudinal half-waves, $m^{\\star}$, increases. The transition from a mode with $m$ half-waves being optimal to a mode with $m+1$ half-waves being optimal occurs at an aspect ratio, denoted $\\beta_t(m)$, where the buckling loads for these two modes are equal. As established, this analysis is performed with $n=1$.\nThe condition for the transition is:\n$$ N_{x,cr}(m,1) = N_{x,cr}(m+1,1) $$\nUsing the expression for $N_{x,cr}(m,1)$, and taking the positive square root of both sides, this is equivalent to:\n$$ \\dfrac{m}{\\beta} + \\dfrac{\\beta}{m} = \\dfrac{m+1}{\\beta} + \\dfrac{\\beta}{m+1} $$\nWe solve this equation for $\\beta = \\beta_t(m)$:\n$$ \\beta \\left( \\dfrac{1}{m} - \\dfrac{1}{m+1} \\right) = \\dfrac{m+1}{\\beta} - \\dfrac{m}{\\beta} $$\n$$ \\beta \\left( \\dfrac{m+1-m}{m(m+1)} \\right) = \\dfrac{1}{\\beta} $$\n$$ \\beta \\left( \\dfrac{1}{m(m+1)} \\right) = \\dfrac{1}{\\beta} $$\n$$ \\beta^2 = m(m+1) $$\nSince the aspect ratio $\\beta$ must be positive, we take the positive root:\n$$ \\beta_t(m) = \\sqrt{m(m+1)} $$\nThis is the closed-form analytic expression for the aspect ratio at which the critical buckling mode transitions from $(m,1)$ to $(m+1,1)$. For any $\\beta$ in the interval $(\\sqrt{(m-1)m}, \\sqrt{m(m+1)})$, the integer mode number that minimizes the buckling load is $m$.\nFor example, the transition from $m=2$ to $m=3$ occurs at $\\beta_t(2) = \\sqrt{2(3)} = \\sqrt{6} \\approx 2.449$. Since $\\beta_0 = 2.3 < \\sqrt{6}$, the optimal mode is indeed $m=2$, which confirms our result in Task 3.\nThe final required answer is the expression for $\\beta_t(m)$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\sqrt{m(m+1)}}$$", "id": "2869820"}, {"introduction": "Real-world structures often exist in complex, anisotropic stress states, which can profoundly influence their buckling behavior.

The critical buckling load for the primary mode is $N_{1} = k_{1}/p_{1}$.\n\nNext, we must analyze the stability of this primary equilibrium path. An equilibrium state is stable if the potential energy is at a local minimum, which requires the Hessian matrix of second derivatives of $\\Pi$ to be positive definite. The Hessian matrix $H$ is given by:\n$$\nH = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{\\partial^{2} \\Pi}{\\partial \\eta_{1}^{2}} & \\frac{\\partial^{2} \\Pi}{\\partial \\eta_{1} \\partial \\eta_{2}} \\\\ \\frac{\\partial^{2} \\Pi}{\\partial \\eta_{2} \\partial \\eta_{1}} & \\frac{\\partial^{2} \\Pi}{\\partial \\eta_{2}^{2}} \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe components of the Hessian are:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial^{2} \\Pi}{\\partial \\eta_{1}^{2}} = (k_{1} - N p_{1}) + 3c_{11}\\eta_{1}^{2} + c_{12}\\eta_{2}^{2}\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial^{2} \\Pi}{\\partial \\eta_{2}^{2}} = (k_{2} - N p_{2}) + c_{12}\\eta_{1}^{2} + 3c_{22}\\eta_{2}^{2}\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial^{2} \\Pi}{\\partial \\eta_{1} \\partial \\eta_{2}} = 2c_{12}\\eta_{1}\\eta_{2}\n$$\nWe evaluate these components on the primary path, i.e., by substituting $\\eta_{2}=0$ and $\\eta_{1}^{2} = (N p_{1} - k_{1})/c_{11}$:\n$$\nH_{11} = (k_{1} - N p_{1}) + 3 c_{11} \\left(\\frac{N p_{1} - k_{1}}{c_{11}}\\right) = (k_{1} - N p_{1}) + 3(N p_{1} - k_{1}) = 2(N p_{1} - k_{1})\n$$\n$$\nH_{22} = (k_{2} - N p_{2}) + c_{12}\\left(\\frac{N p_{1} - k_{1}}{c_{11}}\\right)\n$$\n$$\nH_{12} = 2c_{12}\\eta_{1}(0) = 0\n$$\nThe Hessian matrix on the primary path is therefore diagonal:\n$$\nH_{\\text{primary}} = \\begin{pmatrix} 2(N p_{1} - k_{1}) & 0 \\\\ 0 & (k_{2} - N p_{2}) + \\frac{c_{12}}{c_{11}}(N p_{1} - k_{1}) \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nFor stability, the eigenvalues of this matrix must be positive. Since the matrix is diagonal, the eigenvalues are the diagonal elements. For the primary path to exist, $N > k_{1}/p_{1}$, which ensures that the first eigenvalue $H_{11} = 2(N p_{1} - k_{1})$ is positive.\n\nThe secondary bifurcation occurs when the primary path loses stability. This happens when the second eigenvalue $H_{22}$ passes through zero. The problem asks for the load $N_{\\mathrm{sb}}$ at which the branch loses stability to perturbations in $\\eta_{2}$, which corresponds precisely to the condition $H_{22}=0$.\nSetting the expression for $H_{22}$ to zero at $N = N_{\\mathrm{sb}}$:\n$$\n(k_{2} - N_{\\mathrm{sb}} p_{2}) + \\frac{c_{12}}{c_{11}}(N_{\\mathrm{sb}} p_{1} - k_{1}) = 0\n$$\nWe now solve this linear equation for $N_{\\mathrm{sb}}$. Multiplying by $c_{11}$ to clear the denominator:\n$$\nc_{11}(k_{2} - N_{\\mathrm{sb}} p_{2}) + c_{12}(N_{\\mathrm{sb}} p_{1} - k_{1}) = 0\n$$\n$$\nc_{11}k_{2} - c_{11}N_{\\mathrm{sb}} p_{2} + c_{12}N_{\\mathrm{sb}} p_{1} - c_{12}k_{1} = 0\n$$\nGroup terms containing $N_{\\mathrm{sb}}$:\n$$\nN_{\\mathrm{sb}}(c_{12}p_{1} - c_{11}p_{2}) = c_{12}k_{1} - c_{11}k_{2}\n$$\nIsolating $N_{\\mathrm{sb}}$ gives the final expression for the secondary bifurcation load:\n$$\nN_{\\mathrm{sb}} = \\frac{c_{12}k_{1} - c_{11}k_{2}}{c_{12}p_{1} - c_{11}p_{2}}\n$$\nThis expression depends only on the stiffness and geometric coefficients $k_i$, $p_i$, and the nonlinear coupling coefficients $c_{ij}$, as required.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\frac{c_{12}k_{1} - c_{11}k_{2}}{c_{12}p_{1} - c_{11}p_{2}}}\n$$", "id": "2869800"}]}
