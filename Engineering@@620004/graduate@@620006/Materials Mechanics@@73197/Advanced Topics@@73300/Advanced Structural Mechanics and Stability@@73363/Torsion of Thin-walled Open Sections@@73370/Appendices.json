A solution will be provided.\n\nThe problem requires solving the Poisson equation for the reduced stress function $\\varphi(x,y)$ over a rectangular domain and then calculating the torsional constant $J_{\\text{exact}}$. The domain is defined by $x \\in [-b/2, b/2]$ and $y \\in [-t/2, t/2]$.\n\nThe governing equation and boundary conditions are:\n$$ \\nabla^{2} \\varphi(x,y) = \\frac{\\partial^2 \\varphi}{\\partial x^2} + \\frac{\\partial^2 \\varphi}{\\partial y^2} = -2 \\quad \\text{for } x \\in (-b/2, b/2), y \\in (-t/2, t/2) $$\n$$ \\varphi(\\pm b/2, y) = 0 \\quad \\text{for } y \\in [-t/2, t/2] $$\n$$ \\varphi(x, \\pm t/2) = 0 \\quad \\text{for } x \\in [-b/2, b/2] $$\n\nWe employ the method of superposition by letting $\\varphi(x,y) = \\phi_p(y) + \\psi(x,y)$. We choose a particular solution $\\phi_p(y)$ that depends only on $y$ and satisfies the non-homogeneous part of the equation along with the boundary conditions on the horizontal sides $y = \\pm t/2$.\nLet $\\frac{d^2 \\phi_p}{dy^2} = -2$, which integrates to $\\phi_p(y) = -y^2 + C_1 y + C_2$.\nApplying the boundary conditions $\\phi_p(\\pm t/2) = 0$:\n$$ -(\\pm t/2)^2 + C_1(\\pm t/2) + C_2 = 0 \\implies -\\frac{t^2}{4} \\pm \\frac{C_1 t}{2} + C_2 = 0 $$\nSolving these two equations gives $C_1 = 0$ and $C_2 = t^2/4$. Thus, the particular solution is:\n$$ \\phi_p(y) = \\frac{t^2}{4} - y^2 $$\nSubstituting $\\varphi(x,y) = (\\frac{t^2}{4} - y^2) + \\psi(x,y)$ into the governing equation, we find that $\\psi(x,y)$ must satisfy the homogeneous Laplace equation:\n$$ \\nabla^2 \\psi(x,y) = 0 $$\nThe boundary conditions for $\\psi(x,y)$ are determined from the original conditions on $\\varphi(x,y)$:\n- On $y = \\pm t/2$: $\\varphi(x, \\pm t/2) = (\\frac{t^2}{4} - (\\pm t/2)^2) + \\psi(x, \\pm t/2) = 0 + \\psi(x, \\pm t/2) = 0$.

The boundary condition on the free lateral surface of the bar is that the traction is zero, which implies that $\\psi$ is constant on the boundary of the cross-section. For a singly connected domain, which the area of an open section is, we can set this constant to zero, so $\\psi|_{\\partial A} = 0$.\n\nFor a thin-walled open section, we introduce a local orthogonal coordinate system $(s, n)$, where $s$ is the arc-length coordinate along the midline of the cross-section and $n$ is the normal coordinate, with $n \\in [-t(s)/2, t(s)/2]$. The primary approximation for a thin wall ($t(s) \\ll L$ and $t(s)$ is much smaller than the local radius of curvature of the midline) is that the gradient of the stress function in the normal direction is much larger than in the tangential direction: $|\\frac{\\partial \\psi}{\\partial n}| \\gg |\\frac{\\partial \\psi}{\\partial s}|$. Consequently, the Laplacian operator is approximated as:\n$$\n\\nabla^2 \\psi \\approx \\frac{\\partial^2 \\psi}{\\partial n^2}\n$$\nThe governing equation simplifies to an ordinary differential equation in $n$ for any given station $s$:\n$$\n\\frac{d^2 \\psi}{dn^2} = -2G\\theta\n$$\nThe boundary conditions $\\psi=0$ on the outer boundaries of the wall section translate to $\\psi(s, n=\\pm t(s)/2) = 0$.\n\nIntegrating the simplified equation twice with respect to $n$:\n$$\n\\frac{d\\psi}{dn} = -2G\\theta n + C_1(s)\n$$\n$$\n\\psi(n) = -G\\theta n^2 + C_1(s) n + C_2(s)\n$$\nApplying the boundary conditions at $n = \\pm t(s)/2$:\n$$\n\\psi(t/2) = -G\\theta \\frac{t^2}{4} + C_1 \\frac{t}{2} + C_2 = 0\n$$\n$$\n\\psi(-t/2) = -G\\theta \\frac{t^2}{4} - C_1 \\frac{t}{2} + C_2 = 0\n$$\nSubtracting the second equation from the first yields $C_1 t = 0$, which implies $C_1 = 0$ since $t(s)>0$.

This exercise delves into this advanced topic, guiding you to use asymptotic analysis in a local polar coordinate system to determine the order of the stress singularity at a sharp corner of an L-shaped section [@problem_id:2927717]. Understanding this phenomenon is crucial for fatigue analysis and fracture mechanics, as it explains why an idealized linear elastic model predicts infinite stress and why, in practice, corner rounding is a critical design requirement.", "problem": "A prismatic bar with a thin-walled open L-shaped cross-section is subjected to uniform Saint-Venant torsion about its centroidal axis with constant twist rate per unit length $\\theta'$. The cross-section consists of two orthogonal, flat, straight legs of thickness $t$ meeting at a sharp re-entrant corner; the interior angle of the material domain at that corner is $\\omega = 3\\pi/2$. The legs are long compared to $t$, and the corner radius is negligibly small, so that locally the cross-section is well-approximated by a plane wedge of angle $\\omega$ with traction-free boundary. The material is linear elastic and isotropic with shear modulus $G$, and the boundary is traction-free along the outer and inner faces of the thin walls.\n\nStarting from the Prandtl stress function formulation of Saint-Venant torsion for prismatic bars, and using a local polar coordinate system $(r,\\theta)$ in the cross-sectional plane (two-dimensional ($2$D)) centered at the re-entrant corner with $\\theta$ measured in radians from one wedge face, derive the leading-order asymptotic behavior of the Prandtl stress function near the corner and hence the radial power-law governing the magnitude of the resultant shear stress vector.

No rounding is required. Do not include any units in your final answer.", "solution": "The problem as stated is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. It presents a standard, albeit non-trivial, problem in the theory of elasticity concerning stress singularities at corners under Saint-Venant torsion. All required information is provided, and the problem is free of contradictions or ambiguities. I shall therefore proceed with the solution.\n\nThe problem concerns the asymptotic behavior of stresses near a sharp re-entrant corner in a prismatic bar under torsion. The governing equation for the Prandtl stress function, $\\Phi$, in Saint-Venant torsion is the Poisson equation over the cross-sectional domain $\\Omega$:\n$$\n\\nabla^{2} \\Phi = -2 G \\theta'\n$$\nwhere $G$ is the shear modulus and $\\theta'$ is the rate of twist. The boundary condition on the traction-free edges of the thin-walled open section is $\\Phi = 0$.\n\nFor the purpose of analyzing the local behavior of the fields near the sharp corner tip ($r \\to 0$), we can neglect the constant right-hand side, $-2 G \\theta'$, as it is a lower-order term compared to the singular terms in the solution. The asymptotic field is thus governed by the homogeneous equation, which is the Laplace equation:\n$$\n\\nabla^{2} \\Phi = 0\n$$\nWe analyze this equation in a local polar coordinate system $(r, \\theta)$ centered at the corner tip. The domain is a wedge with an interior angle $\\omega = 3\\pi/2$. The faces of the wedge are located at $\\theta = 0$ and $\\theta = \\omega$. The Laplace equation in polar coordinates is:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial^{2} \\Phi}{\\partial r^{2}} + \\frac{1}{r} \\frac{\\partial \\Phi}{\\partial r} + \\frac{1}{r^{2}} \\frac{\\partial^{2} \\Phi}{\\partial \\theta^{2}} = 0\n$$\nThe traction-free boundary condition translates to $\\Phi = 0$ on the faces of the wedge:\n$$\n\\Phi(r, 0) = 0\n$$\n$$\n\\Phi(r, \\omega) = 0\n$$\nWe seek a separable solution of the form $\\Phi(r, \\theta) = R(r) \\Theta(\\theta)$. Substituting this into the Laplace equation and separating variables yields two ordinary differential equations:\n$$\n\\frac{d^{2} \\Theta}{d \\theta^{2}} + \\lambda \\Theta = 0\n$$\n$$\nr^{2} \\frac{d^{2} R}{d r^{2}} + r \\frac{d R}{d r} - \\lambda R = 0\n$$\nwhere $\\lambda$ is the separation constant.\n\nFirst, we solve the equation for $\\Theta(\\theta)$. The general solution is $\\Theta(\\theta) = A \\cos(\\sqrt{\\lambda}\\theta) + B \\sin(\\sqrt{\\lambda}\\theta)$. Applying the boundary condition $\\Theta(0) = 0$ gives $A = 0$. The solution becomes $\\Theta(\\theta) = B \\sin(\\sqrt{\\lambda}\\theta)$. Applying the second boundary condition $\\Theta(\\omega) = 0$ requires that $\\sin(\\sqrt{\\lambda}\\omega) = 0$ for a non-trivial solution ($B \\neq 0$). This yields the eigenvalues:\n$$\n\\sqrt{\\lambda_{n}} \\omega = n\\pi, \\quad n = 1, 2, 3, \\dots\n$$\n$$\n\\lambda_{n} = \\left(\\frac{n\\pi}{\\omega}\\right)^{2}\n$$\nThe corresponding eigenfunctions are $\\Theta_{n}(\\theta) = B_{n} \\sin\\left(\\frac{n\\pi\\theta}{\\omega}\\right)$.\n\nNext, we solve the equation for $R(r)$, which is a Cauchy-Euler equation. Assuming a solution form $R(r) = r^{k}$, we obtain the characteristic equation $k(k-1) + k - \\lambda_{n} = 0$, which simplifies to $k^{2} = \\lambda_{n}$. The solutions for $k$ are $k = \\pm \\sqrt{\\lambda_{n}} = \\pm \\frac{n\\pi}{\\omega}$. The general solution for $R_{n}(r)$ is:\n$$\nR_{n}(r) = C_{n} r^{n\\pi/\\omega} + D_{n} r^{-n\\pi/\\omega}\n$$\nThe full solution for $\\Phi$ is a linear superposition of the separable solutions:\n$$\n\\Phi(r, \\theta) = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\left( C_{n} r^{n\\pi/\\omega} + D_{n} r^{-n\\pi/\\omega} \\right) \\sin\\left(\\frac{n\\pi\\theta}{\\omega}\\right)\n$$\nFor a physically meaningful solution, the strain energy stored in any neighborhood of the corner must be finite. The strain energy density is proportional to $|\\nabla \\Phi|^{2}$. Terms with negative powers of $r$ ($D_{n} \\neq 0$) would lead to infinite strain energy as $r \\to 0$ and must be excluded. Thus, $D_{n}=0$ for all $n$. The asymptotic behavior as $r \\to 0$ is dominated by the term with the smallest positive exponent. This corresponds to $n=1$. Let us define $p = \\pi/\\omega$. The leading-order term for the stress function is:\n$$\n\\Phi(r, \\theta) \\sim K r^{p} \\sin(p\\theta) \\quad \\text{as } r \\to 0\n$$\nfor some constant $K$.\n\nThe non-zero shear stress components in Saint-Venant torsion, $\\tau_{xz}$ and $\\tau_{yz}$, are given by the derivatives of $\\Phi$. In polar coordinates, the corresponding stress components are the out-of-plane shear stresses $\\tau_{rz}$ and $\\tau_{\\theta z}$:\n$$\n\\tau_{rz} = \\frac{1}{r} \\frac{\\partial \\Phi}{\\partial \\theta} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\tau_{\\theta z} = -\\frac{\\partial \\Phi}{\\partial r}\n$$\nUsing the asymptotic form of $\\Phi$, we find the asymptotic behavior of the stress components:\n$$\n\\tau_{rz} \\sim \\frac{1}{r} K p r^{p} \\cos(p\\theta) = K p r^{p-1} \\cos(p\\theta)\n$$\n$$\n\\tau_{\\theta z} \\sim -K p r^{p-1} \\sin(p\\theta)\n$$\nThe magnitude of the resultant shear stress vector $\\boldsymbol{\\tau}$ is $\\|\\boldsymbol{\\tau}\\| = \\sqrt{\\tau_{rz}^{2} + \\tau_{\\theta z}^{2}}$.\n$$\n\\|\\boldsymbol{\\tau}\\| \\sim \\sqrt{(K p r^{p-1} \\cos(p\\theta))^{2} + (-K p r^{p-1} \\sin(p\\theta))^{2}}\n$$\n$$\n\\|\\boldsymbol{\\tau}\\| \\sim \\sqrt{(K p r^{p-1})^{2} (\\cos^{2}(p\\theta) + \\sin^{2}(p\\theta))} = |K p| r^{p-1}\n$$\nThe problem defines the singularity exponent $s$ through the relation $\\|\\boldsymbol{\\tau}\\| \\sim C r^{-s}$. Comparing our result with this definition, we equate the exponents:\n$$\n-s = p - 1 = \\frac{\\pi}{\\omega} - 1\n$$\nTherefore, the singularity exponent is:\n$$\ns = 1 - \\frac{\\pi}{\\omega}\n$$\nThis general result is valid for any wedge angle $\\omega$. A singularity ($s>0$) exists for re-entrant corners, where $\\omega > \\pi$.\nFor the given L-shaped section, the interior angle at the re-entrant corner is $\\omega = 3\\pi/2$ radians. Substituting this value into the expression for $s$:\n$$\ns = 1 - \\frac{\\pi}{3\\pi/2} = 1 - \\frac{2}{3} = \\frac{1}{3}\n$$\n\nFinally, regarding the implications:\nThe exponent of the stress function itself is $p = \\pi/\\omega = 2/3 > 0$. The total torque is $T = 2\\iint_{\\Omega} \\Phi \\, dA$. Near the corner, the integral behaves as $\\int r^{p} \\cdot r \\, dr = \\int r^{p+1} \\, dr = \\int r^{5/3} \\, dr$. Since the exponent $5/3 > 0$, the integral converges, meaning the total torque and thus the torsional rigidity are finite despite the stress singularity.\nFrom a design perspective, a stress singularity ($s=1/3 > 0$) implies that according to linear elastic theory, the stress at the corner is infinite. This indicates a high risk of localized yielding or fracture initiation. Therefore, in practical engineering design, sharp re-entrant corners must be avoided. Designers must specify a fillet radius at such corners to alleviate the stress concentration and keep the maximum stress within the material's allowable limits.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{1}{3}}$$", "id": "2927717"}]}
