These assumptions correspond to specific boundary conditions applied to the RVE and represent kinematically admissible and statically admissible fields.\n\n**1. Voigt Upper Bounds ($K_V, G_V$)**\n\nThe Voigt model is based on the assumption of a uniform strain field throughout the composite, equal to the macroscopic strain $\\langle\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}\\rangle$.\n$$\n\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}(\\mathbf{x}) = \\langle\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}\\rangle \\quad \\forall \\mathbf{x} \\in V\n$$\nThis is a kinematically admissible field that can be generated by applying linear displacement boundary conditions $u_i = \\langle\\varepsilon_{ij}\\rangle x_j$ to the RVE. Under this assumption, the strain is uniform across both phases: $\\langle\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}\\rangle_1 = \\langle\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}\\rangle_2 = \\langle\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}\\rangle$.\n\nThe local stress in each phase is given by the constitutive law of that phase: $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}_1 = \\mathbf{C}_1 \\langle\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}\\rangle$ and $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}_2 = \\mathbf{C}_2 \\langle\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}\\rangle$.

The effective stiffness is its inverse, $\\mathbf{C}_R = \\mathbf{S}_R^{-1}$. For isotropic materials, we can work with the inverse moduli.

An infinite compliance implies zero stiffness.\n$$\nK_R = 0\n$$\nTo find the shear modulus $G_R$, we apply a uniform shear stress $\\tau$. The shear strain in each phase is $\\gamma_1 = \\frac{1}{G_s}\\tau$ and $\\gamma_2 = \\frac{1}{G_2}\\tau = \\frac{1}{0}\\tau$.

They represent a rule of mixtures for compliance and are an underestimate because they do not enforce strain compatibility, leading to gaps or overlaps between phases in the deformed state.\n\n**3. Physical Implications**\n\nThe derivation shows that for any non-zero porosity $\\phi > 0$, the Reuss lower bounds for both bulk and shear moduli are exactly zero. Mechanically, the isostress assumption implies that the applied load is partitioned equally as stress across both the solid matrix and the void phase. Since a void cannot sustain any stress ($K_2=0, G_2=0$), it must deform infinitely to satisfy the constitutive relation $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}_2 = \\mathbf{C}_2 \\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}_2$ for any non-zero $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}_2$. By averaging, this infinite local deformation leads to an infinite macroscopic deformation, which corresponds to zero effective stiffness for the composite.\n\nThis result highlights a critical deficiency of the Reuss model for porous materials. The model is equivalent to a 'series' mechanical arrangement. The presence of even a minuscule fraction of a phase with zero stiffness (infinite compliance) in this series arrangement creates a path of infinite compliance for the entire structure, causing its overall stiffness to vanish.\n\nIn reality, for a material with isolated pores, the stress is not uniform; it concentrates in the solid matrix surrounding the voids. The solid matrix provides structural integrity, and the effective stiffness is finite and non-zero. The Reuss bound is thus mathematically correct under its strict assumption, but physically uninformative as a practical lower limit. It only becomes physically relevant in the limiting case where the porosity $\\phi$ is high enough for the voids to form a continuous, percolating network through the RVE, which would indeed cause a loss of structural integrity and a drop in stiffness to zero. For non-percolating porosity, more restrictive bounds like the Hashin-Shtrikman bounds are required to provide a meaningful, non-zero lower bound.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n(1-\\phi) K_s & 0 & (1-\\phi) G_s & 0\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "2915423"}, {"introduction": "Building on the previous exercises, this final practice moves towards a more general and powerful analysis of the Voigt–Reuss bounds themselves.

This implies $\\sigma_{m,1} = \\sigma_{m,2} = \\bar{\\sigma}_m$ and $\\boldsymbol{s}_1 = \\boldsymbol{s}_2 = \\bar{\\boldsymbol{s}}$.\n\nFor the hydrostatic response, the macroscopic volumetric strain is:\n$$\n\\bar{\\varepsilon}_v = \\langle \\varepsilon_v \\rangle = v_1 \\varepsilon_{v,1} + v_2 \\varepsilon_{v,2} = v_1 \\frac{\\sigma_{m,1}}{K_1} + v_2 \\frac{\\sigma_{m,2}}{K_2}\n$$\nSubstituting $\\sigma_{m,1} = \\sigma_{m,2} = \\bar{\\sigma}_m$:\n$$\n\\bar{\\varepsilon}_v = \\left(\\frac{v_1}{K_1} + \\frac{v_2}{K_2}\\right) \\bar{\\sigma}_m\n$$\nThus, the effective bulk modulus under the Reuss assumption is given by the harmonic mean:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{K_{\\text{Reuss}}} = \\frac{v_1}{K_1} + \\frac{v_2}{K_2} \\implies K_{\\text{Reuss}} = \\left(\\frac{v_1}{K_1} + \\frac{v_2}{K_2}\\right)^{-1}\n$$\nFor the deviatoric response, the macroscopic deviatoric strain is:\n$$\n\\bar{\\boldsymbol{e}} = \\langle \\boldsymbol{e} \\rangle = v_1 \\boldsymbol{e}_1 + v_2 \\boldsymbol{e}_2 = v_1 \\frac{\\boldsymbol{s}_1}{2G_1} + v_2 \\frac{\\boldsymbol{s}_2}{2G_2}\n$$\nSubstituting $\\boldsymbol{s}_1 = \\boldsymbol{s}_2 = \\bar{\\boldsymbol{s}}$:\n$$\n\\bar{\\boldsymbol{e}} = \\left(\\frac{v_1}{2G_1} + \\frac{v_2}{2G_2}\\right) \\bar{\\boldsymbol{s}}\n$$\nFrom this, the effective shear modulus is:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{G_{\\text{Reuss}}} = \\frac{v_1}{G_1} + \\frac{v_2}{G_2} \\implies G_{\\text{Reuss}} = \\left(\\frac{v_1}{G_1} + \\frac{v_2}{G_2}\\right)^{-1}\n$$\nThese are the lower bounds, denoted $K_{\\text{lower}}$ and $G_{\\text{lower}}$.\n\n**3. Asymptotic Analysis of Bound Widths**\nWe now analyze the dimensionless bound widths in the high-contrast limit. Let us first focus on the bulk modulus. The dimensionless width $w_K$ is defined as:\n$$\nw_K(\\epsilon_K,v_1) = \\frac{K_{\\text{upper}} - K_{\\text{lower}}}{K_1} = \\frac{(v_1 K_1 + v_2 K_2) - \\left(\\frac{v_1}{K_1} + \\frac{v_2}{K_2}\\right)^{-1}}{K_1}\n$$\nWe introduce the contrast parameter $\\epsilon_K = K_2/K_1$ and substitute $v_2 = 1-v_1$:\n$$\nw_K = \\frac{v_1 K_1 + (1-v_1) \\epsilon_K K_1}{K_1} - \\frac{1}{K_1}\\left(\\frac{v_1}{K_1} + \\frac{1-v_1}{\\epsilon_K K_1}\\right)^{-1}\n$$\n$$\nw_K = v_1 + (1-v_1) \\epsilon_K - \\left(v_1 + \\frac{1-v_1}{\\epsilon_K}\\right)^{-1}\n$$\n$$\nw_K = v_1 + (1-v_1) \\epsilon_K - \\left(\\frac{v_1 \\epsilon_K + 1-v_1}{\\epsilon_K}\\right)^{-1} = v_1 + (1-v_1) \\epsilon_K - \\frac{\\epsilon_K}{1-v_1+v_1\\epsilon_K}\n$$\nTo simplify, we find a common denominator:\n$$\nw_K = \\frac{\\left(v_1 + (1-v_1) \\epsilon_K\\right)\\left(1-v_1+v_1\\epsilon_K\\right) - \\epsilon_K}{1-v_1+v_1\\epsilon_K}\n$$\nLet us expand the numerator. Let $v_2 = 1-v_1$:\n$$\n\\text{Numerator} = (v_1 + v_2 \\epsilon_K)(v_2 + v_1 \\epsilon_K) - \\epsilon_K = v_1v_2 + v_1^2 \\epsilon_K + v_2^2 \\epsilon_K + v_1v_2 \\epsilon_K^2 - \\epsilon_K\n$$\n$$\n= v_1v_2 + (v_1^2 + v_2^2 - 1)\\epsilon_K + v_1v_2 \\epsilon_K^2\n$$\nUsing the identity $(v_1+v_2)^2 = 1 \\implies v_1^2+v_2^2+2v_1v_2 = 1 \\implies v_1^2+v_2^2-1 = -2v_1v_2$:\n$$\n\\text{Numerator} = v_1v_2 - 2v_1v_2 \\epsilon_K + v_1v_2 \\epsilon_K^2 = v_1v_2 (1-2\\epsilon_K+\\epsilon_K^2) = v_1v_2(1-\\epsilon_K)^2\n$$\nSo the exact expression for the width is:\n$$\nw_K(\\epsilon_K, v_1) = \\frac{v_1(1-v_1)(1-\\epsilon_K)^2}{(1-v_1)+v_1\\epsilon_K}\n$$\nThe leading-order asymptotic expression for $w_K$ as $\\epsilon_K \\to 0$ is found by evaluating the expression at $\\epsilon_K=0$:\n$$\n\\lim_{\\epsilon_K \\to 0} w_K(\\epsilon_K, v_1) = \\frac{v_1(1-v_1)(1-0)^2}{(1-v_1)+v_1(0)} = \\frac{v_1(1-v_1)}{1-v_1}\n$$\nSince $v_1 \\in (0,1)$, $1-v_1 \\neq 0$, so we can cancel this term:\n$$\n\\lim_{\\epsilon_K \\to 0} w_K(\\epsilon_K, v_1) = v_1\n$$\nThe derivation for the shear modulus width $w_G$ is mathematically identical due to the analogous forms of the Voigt and Reuss bounds for $G$. Substituting $G_1$, $G_2$, and $\\epsilon_G = G_2/G_1$ in place of $K_1$, $K_2$, and $\\epsilon_K$, we obtain:\n$$\nw_G(\\epsilon_G, v_1) = \\frac{v_1(1-v_1)(1-\\epsilon_G)^2}{(1-v_1)+v_1\\epsilon_G}\n$$\nThe leading-order asymptotic expression as $\\epsilon_G \\to 0$ is therefore:\n$$\n\\lim_{\\epsilon_G \\to 0} w_G(\\epsilon_G, v_1) = v_1\n$$\nThus, in the high-contrast limit, the leading-order terms of the dimensionless bound widths for both the bulk and shear moduli are equal to the volume fraction of the stiffer phase, $v_1$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\nv_1 & v_1\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "2915472"}]}
