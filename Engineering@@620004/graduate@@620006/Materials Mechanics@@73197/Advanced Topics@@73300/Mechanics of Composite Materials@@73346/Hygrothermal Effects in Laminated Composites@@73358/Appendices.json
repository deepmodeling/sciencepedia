The problem requires a straightforward application of definitions and a standard derivation based on conservation of mass and mixture rules. No flaws from the checklist are identified. We may proceed to the solution.\n\nThe problem is addressed in two parts.\n\nPart 1: Numerical Calculation\n\nThe objective is to compute the equilibrium mass gain $\\Delta m_{\\infty}$ in milligrams.\nWe are given the definition of the dimensionless composite equilibrium mass gain fraction:\n$$M_{c,\\infty} = \\frac{\\Delta m_{\\infty}}{m_{0}}$$\nHere, $m_{0}$ is the initial dry mass of the coupon and $\\Delta m_{\\infty}$ is the mass increase at equilibrium.\nThe provided values are $m_{0} = 15.00\\,\\mathrm{g}$ and $M_{c,\\infty} = 0.0125$.\nRearranging the definitional equation to solve for $\\Delta m_{\\infty}$ gives:\n$$\\Delta m_{\\infty} = M_{c,\\infty} \\times m_{0}$$\nSubstituting the numerical values:\n$$\\Delta m_{\\infty} = 0.0125 \\times 15.00\\,\\mathrm{g} = 0.1875\\,\\mathrm{g}$$\nThe problem requires the answer in milligrams ($\\mathrm{mg}$).

Thus, the total mass of absorbed moisture is equal to the mass of moisture absorbed by the matrix:\n$$\\Delta m_{\\infty} = \\Delta m_{m}$$\nThe equilibrium moisture uptake of the matrix, $M_{m,\\infty}$, is defined as the mass of moisture absorbed by the matrix relative to the dry mass of the matrix, $m_{0,m}$:\n$$M_{m,\\infty} = \\frac{\\Delta m_{m}}{m_{0,m}} \\implies \\Delta m_{m} = M_{m,\\infty} \\cdot m_{0,m}$$\nSubstituting this into the expression for $M_{c,\\infty}$:\n$$M_{c,\\infty} = \\frac{M_{m,\\infty} \\cdot m_{0,m}}{m_{0,c}}$$\nThis equation shows that the composite moisture uptake is the matrix moisture uptake, $M_{m,\\infty}$, scaled by the mass fraction of the matrix in the dry composite, $W_{m} = \\frac{m_{0,m}}{m_{0,c}}$.\n\nNow, we must express this mass fraction $W_{m}$ in terms of the given volume fractions and densities. The total dry mass of the composite, $m_{0,c}$, is the sum of the dry mass of the fibers, $m_{0,f}$, and the dry mass of the matrix, $m_{0,m}$:\n$$m_{0,c} = m_{0,f} + m_{0,m}$$\nThe mass fraction of the matrix is therefore:\n$$W_{m} = \\frac{m_{0,m}}{m_{0,f} + m_{0,m}}$$\nUsing the definition of density ($\\rho=m/V$), we can express the masses in terms of density and volume:\n$m_{0,f} = \\rho_{f} V_{f,abs}$ and $m_{0,m} = \\rho_{m} V_{m,abs}$, where $V_{f,abs}$ and $V_{m,abs}$ are the absolute volumes of fiber and matrix.\n$$W_{m} = \\frac{\\rho_{m} V_{m,abs}}{\\rho_{f} V_{f,abs} + \\rho_{m} V_{m,abs}}$$\nThe problem specifies the fiber volume fraction, $V_{f}$, which is defined as $V_{f} = V_{f,abs} / V_{c}$, where $V_{c}$ is the total volume of the composite. From the assumption of no voids, the matrix volume fraction is $V_{m} = V_{m,abs} / V_{c} = 1 - V_{f}$.\nTo eliminate the absolute volumes, we divide the numerator and denominator by the total volume $V_{c}$:\n$$W_{m} = \\frac{\\rho_{m} (V_{m,abs}/V_{c})}{\\rho_{f} (V_{f,abs}/V_{c}) + \\rho_{m} (V_{m,abs}/V_{c})} = \\frac{\\rho_{m} V_{m}}{\\rho_{f} V_{f} + \\rho_{m} V_{m}}$$\nSubstituting $V_{m} = 1 - V_{f}$:\n$$W_{m} = \\frac{\\rho_{m} (1 - V_{f})}{\\rho_{f} V_{f} + \\rho_{m} (1 - V_{f})}$$\nFinally, we substitute this expression for the matrix mass fraction back into the equation for $M_{c,\\infty}$:\n$$M_{c,\\infty} = M_{m,\\infty} \\cdot W_{m} = M_{m,\\infty} \\frac{\\rho_{m} (1 - V_{f})}{\\rho_{f} V_{f} + \\rho_{m} (1 - V_{f})}$$\nThis is the required closed-form expression for the composite equilibrium mass gain fraction. The denominator, $\\rho_{f} V_{f} + \\rho_{m} (1 - V_{f})$, is the rule-of-mixtures expression for the dry composite density, $\\rho_{c}$.\n\nThe final answer consists of the numerical result from Part 1 and the symbolic expression from Part 2, presented as a row matrix.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n188 & M_{m,\\infty} \\frac{\\rho_m (1 - V_f)}{\\rho_f V_f + \\rho_m (1 - V_f)}\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "2893091"}, {"introduction": "Once moisture is absorbed, it causes the material to swell, but this swelling is not uniform in a unidirectional lamina.

It is a standard problem in the mechanics of composite materials.\n\nPart A: Conceptual Explanation of Hygrothermal Anisotropy\n\nA unidirectional composite lamina is a two-phase material, consisting of stiff, high-strength fibers embedded within a relatively soft polymer matrix. The significant anisotropy in hygrothermal properties—that is, the large differences $(\\alpha_{2}-\\alpha_{1})$ and $(\\beta_{2}-\\beta_{1})$—is a direct consequence of this microscopic architecture and the vastly different properties of the constituent materials.\n\n$1$. Response in the Fiber Direction (Longitudinal, axis $1$):\nIn the longitudinal direction, the fibers and matrix are arranged in parallel. When the lamina is subjected to a hygrothermal load, both phases ideally must deform by the same amount to maintain material continuity (compatibility). This imposes an iso-strain condition. The fibers, such as carbon or glass, typically possess very high axial stiffness (Young's modulus $E_{f}$) and a very low, sometimes negative, coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE), $\\alpha_{f}$. They also exhibit negligible hygroscopic expansion, $\\beta_{f} \\approx 0$. The polymer matrix, in contrast, has a much lower stiffness ($E_{m} \\ll E_{f}$) but a large positive CTE, $\\alpha_{m}$, and a significant coefficient of moisture expansion (CME), $\\beta_{m}$.\nAccording to the rule of mixtures for axial properties, the stiff fibers dominate the composite's response. The fibers effectively restrain the matrix from expanding or contracting. Consequently, the overall longitudinal CTE, $\\alpha_{1}$, and CME, $\\beta_{1}$, of the lamina are very small and are primarily dictated by the properties of the fibers. They can be approximated by:\n$$ \\alpha_{1} \\approx \\frac{E_{f}V_{f}\\alpha_{f} + E_{m}V_{m}\\alpha_{m}}{E_{f}V_{f} + E_{m}V_{m}} \\approx \\alpha_{f} $$\n$$ \\beta_{1} \\approx \\frac{E_{f}V_{f}\\beta_{f} + E_{m}V_{m}\\beta_{m}}{E_{f}V_{f} + E_{m}V_{m}} \\approx 0 $$\nwhere $V_f$ and $V_m$ are the volume fractions of fiber and matrix, respectively. Since $E_f \\gg E_m$, the expressions are dominated by the fiber terms.\n\n$2$. Response in the Transverse Direction (axis $2$):\nIn the direction transverse to the fibers, the constituents are arranged more like a series system. The matrix is the continuous phase, and the load (in this case, the impetus to expand) is transferred through the matrix. The fibers act as relatively rigid, non-expanding inclusions. The overall expansion of the composite is not strongly constrained by the fibers in this direction. The matrix is largely free to expand or swell in the gaps between fibers.\nTherefore, the transverse CTE, $\\alpha_{2}$, and CME, $\\beta_{2}$, are dominated by the properties of the polymer matrix. While more complex micromechanical models exist, a first approximation shows that $\\alpha_{2}$ and $\\beta_{2}$ are much closer to $\\alpha_{m}$ and $\\beta_{m}$ than to the fiber properties:\n$$ \\alpha_{2} \\approx (1+\\nu_{m})V_{m}\\alpha_{m} + (1+\\nu_{f})V_{f}\\alpha_{f} - \\nu_{12}\\alpha_{1} \\approx \\alpha_{m} $$\n$$ \\beta_{2} \\approx V_{m}\\beta_{m} + V_{f}\\beta_{f} \\approx \\beta_{m} $$\nwhere $\\nu$ represents Poisson's ratio.\n\nConclusion:\nThe large anisotropy arises because $\\alpha_{1}$ and $\\beta_{1}$ are small values governed by the fibers, while $\\alpha_{2}$ and $\\beta_{2}$ are large values governed by the matrix. The difference is substantial: $\\alpha_{2} \\gg \\alpha_{1}$ and $\\beta_{2} \\gg \\beta_{1}$. This explains why the terms $(\\alpha_{2}-\\alpha_{1})$ and $(\\beta_{2}-\\beta_{1})$ are large, reflecting the fundamental mismatch in hygrothermal response between the fiber and matrix, amplified by the material's geometry.\n\nPart B: Derivation and Calculation of Off-Axis Shear Strain\n\nThe in-plane strain components in the global $(x, y)$ coordinate system are related to the strain components in the principal material $(1, 2)$ system by the standard strain transformation equations.

We substitute the given hygrothermal strain components, $\\varepsilon_{1}^{\\mathrm{ht}}$, $\\varepsilon_{2}^{\\mathrm{ht}}$, and $\\gamma_{12}^{\\mathrm{ht}}$, into this equation:\n$$ \\gamma_{xy}^{\\mathrm{ht}} = (\\varepsilon_{2}^{\\mathrm{ht}} - \\varepsilon_{1}^{\\mathrm{ht}}) \\sin(2\\theta) + \\gamma_{12}^{\\mathrm{ht}} \\cos(2\\theta) $$\nThe problem states the constitutive relations for the principal hygrothermal strains:\n$$ \\varepsilon_{1}^{\\mathrm{ht}} = \\alpha_{1}\\Delta T + \\beta_{1}\\Delta M $$\n$$ \\varepsilon_{2}^{\\mathrm{ht}} = \\alpha_{2}\\Delta T + \\beta_{2}\\Delta M $$\n$$ \\gamma_{12}^{\\mathrm{ht}} = 0 $$\nSubstituting these expressions into the transformation equation for $\\gamma_{xy}^{\\mathrm{ht}}$ and noting that $\\gamma_{12}^{\\mathrm{ht}}=0$:\n$$ \\gamma_{xy}^{\\mathrm{ht}} = ((\\alpha_{2}\\Delta T + \\beta_{2}\\Delta M) - (\\alpha_{1}\\Delta T + \\beta_{1}\\Delta M)) \\sin(2\\theta) $$\nThis expression can be rearranged by grouping the $\\Delta T$ and $\\Delta M$ terms:\n$$ \\gamma_{xy}^{\\mathrm{ht}} = ((\\alpha_{2} - \\alpha_{1})\\Delta T + (\\beta_{2} - \\beta_{1})\\Delta M) \\sin(2\\theta) $$\nThis is the required analytical expression for the off-axis hygrothermal shear strain.\n\nNow, we evaluate this expression using the provided numerical data:\n- $\\alpha_{1}=0.2\\times 10^{-6}\\ \\mathrm{K}^{-1}$\n- $\\alpha_{2}=35\\times 10^{-6}\\ \\mathrm{K}^{-1}$\n- $\\beta_{1}=2.0\\times 10^{-4}$\n- $\\beta_{2}=2.0\\times 10^{-2}$\n- $\\Delta T=60\\ \\mathrm{K}$\n- $\\Delta M=0.015$\n- $\\theta=30^{\\circ}$\n\nFirst, we calculate the differences in the coefficients:\n$$ \\alpha_{2} - \\alpha_{1} = (35 \\times 10^{-6} - 0.2 \\times 10^{-6})\\ \\mathrm{K}^{-1} = 34.8 \\times 10^{-6}\\ \\mathrm{K}^{-1} $$\n$$ \\beta_{2} - \\beta_{1} = (2.0 \\times 10^{-2} - 2.0 \\times 10^{-4}) = (200 \\times 10^{-4} - 2.0 \\times 10^{-4}) = 198 \\times 10^{-4} = 1.98 \\times 10^{-2} $$\n\nNext, we calculate the total difference in normal strain in the principal axes, $\\varepsilon_{2}^{\\mathrm{ht}} - \\varepsilon_{1}^{\\mathrm{ht}}$:\nThe thermal contribution is:\n$$ (\\alpha_{2} - \\alpha_{1})\\Delta T = (34.8 \\times 10^{-6}) \\times 60 = 2088 \\times 10^{-6} = 2.088 \\times 10^{-3} $$\nThe hygroscopic contribution is:\n$$ (\\beta_{2} - \\beta_{1})\\Delta M = (1.98 \\times 10^{-2}) \\times 0.015 = 2.97 \\times 10^{-4} = 0.297 \\times 10^{-3} $$\nThe total difference is the sum of these two contributions:\n$$ \\varepsilon_{2}^{\\mathrm{ht}} - \\varepsilon_{1}^{\\mathrm{ht}} = 2.088 \\times 10^{-3} + 0.297 \\times 10^{-3} = 2.385 \\times 10^{-3} $$\n\nFinally, we calculate the shear strain $\\gamma_{xy}^{\\mathrm{ht}}$.

Thus, the transformed stiffness matrix is simply $[\\bar{Q}]^{(0)} = [Q]$, and the hygral strains in the laminate axes are the same as in the principal axes: $\\{\\varepsilon\\}^m_{(0)} = \\{\\varepsilon_1^m, \\varepsilon_2^m, \\gamma_{12}^m\\}^T$.\nThe stress components are:\n$$ \\begin{Bmatrix} \\sigma_x^{(0)} \\\\ \\sigma_y^{(0)} \\\\ \\tau_{xy}^{(0)} \\end{Bmatrix} = - \\begin{Bmatrix} Q_{11} & Q_{12} & 0 \\\\ Q_{12} & Q_{22} & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & Q_{66} \\end{Bmatrix} \\begin{Bmatrix} 0.00024 \\\\ 0.00420 \\\\ 0 \\end{Bmatrix} $$\n$$ \\sigma_x^{(0)} = -(Q_{11} \\varepsilon_1^m + Q_{12} \\varepsilon_2^m) = -(130711.5 \\times 0.00024 + 2533.7 \\times 0.00420) \\approx -(31.371 + 10.642) = -42.013\\,\\text{MPa} $$\n$$ \\sigma_y^{(0)} = -(Q_{12} \\varepsilon_1^m + Q_{22} \\varepsilon_2^m) = -(2533.7 \\times 0.00024 + 9049.0 \\times 0.00420) \\approx -(0.608 + 38.006) = -38.614\\,\\text{MPa} $$\n$$ \\tau_{xy}^{(0)} = -Q_{66} \\gamma_{12}^m = 0\\,\\text{MPa} $$\n\nFor the $90^{\\circ}$ ply:\nThe ply angle is $\\theta = 90^{\\circ}$. For this orientation, the ply axes are rotated such that the $1$-axis aligns with the laminate $y$-axis, and the $2$-axis aligns with the laminate $x$-axis. The transformation rules for stiffness yield: $[\\bar{Q}]_{xx} = Q_{22}$, $[\\bar{Q}]_{yy} = Q_{11}$, $[\\bar{Q}]_{xy} = Q_{12}$, and $[\\bar{Q}]_{ss} = Q_{66}$. All interaction terms are zero.\nThe hygral strains in the laminate axes are found by transformation:\n$$ \\varepsilon_x^m(90^{\\circ}) = \\varepsilon_1^m \\cos^2(90^{\\circ}) + \\varepsilon_2^m \\sin^2(90^{\\circ}) = \\varepsilon_2^m = 0.00420 $$\n$$ \\varepsilon_y^m(90^{\\circ}) = \\varepsilon_1^m \\sin^2(90^{\\circ}) + \\varepsilon_2^m \\cos^2(90^{\\circ}) = \\varepsilon_1^m = 0.00024 $$\n$$ \\gamma_{xy}^m(90^{\\circ}) = -2(\\varepsilon_1^m - \\varepsilon_2^m)\\sin(90^{\\circ})\\cos(90^{\\circ}) = 0 $$\nThe stress components are calculated as:\n$$ \\begin{Bmatrix} \\sigma_x^{(90)} \\\\ \\sigma_y^{(90)} \\\\ \\tau_{xy}^{(90)} \\end{Bmatrix} = - \\begin{Bmatrix} Q_{22} & Q_{12} & 0 \\\\ Q_{12} & Q_{11} & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & Q_{66} \\end{Bmatrix} \\begin{Bmatrix} 0.00420 \\\\ 0.00024 \\\\ 0 \\end{Bmatrix} $$\n$$ \\sigma_x^{(90)} = -(Q_{22} \\varepsilon_x^m + Q_{12} \\varepsilon_y^m) = -(9049.0 \\times 0.00420 + 2533.7 \\times 0.00024) \\approx -(38.006 + 0.608) = -38.614\\,\\text{MPa} $$\n$$ \\sigma_y^{(90)} = -(Q_{12} \\varepsilon_x^m + Q_{11} \\varepsilon_y^m) = -(2533.7 \\times 0.00420 + 130711.5 \\times 0.00024) \\approx -(10.642 + 31.371) = -42.013\\,\\text{MPa} $$\n$$ \\tau_{xy}^{(90)} = 0\\,\\text{MPa} $$\nThe results show the expected symmetry for a cross-ply laminate: $\\sigma_x^{(0)} = \\sigma_y^{(90)}$ and $\\sigma_y^{(0)} = \\sigma_x^{(90)}$.\n\nFinally, we identify the critical stress component, which is the one with the largest absolute value. The calculated stress values are:\n$\\sigma_x^{(0)} = -42.013\\,\\text{MPa}$\n$\\sigma_y^{(0)} = -38.614\\,\\text{MPa}$\n$\\tau_{xy}^{(0)} = 0\\,\\text{MPa}$\n$\\sigma_x^{(90)} = -38.614\\,\\text{MPa}$\n$\\sigma_y^{(90)} = -42.013\\,\\text{MPa}$\n$\\tau_{xy}^{(90)} = 0\\,\\text{MPa}$\n\nThe maximum absolute stress is $|\\sigma|_{\\max} = \\max(|-42.013|, |-38.614|, |0|) = 42.013\\,\\text{MPa}$. This critical stress occurs as $\\sigma_x$ in the $0^{\\circ}$ plies and as $\\sigma_y$ in the $90^{\\circ}$ plies.\n\nRounding the results to three significant figures as requested:\n$\\sigma_x^{(0)} = -42.0\\,\\text{MPa}$\n$\\sigma_y^{(0)} = -38.6\\,\\text{MPa}$\n$\\tau_{xy}^{(0)} = 0.00\\,\\text{MPa}$\n$\\sigma_x^{(90)} = -38.6\\,\\text{MPa}$\n$\\sigma_y^{(90)} = -42.0\\,\\text{MPa}$\n$\\tau_{xy}^{(90)} = 0.00\\,\\text{MPa}$\n$|\\sigma|_{\\max} = 42.0\\,\\text{MPa}$\n\nThese values are assembled into the required row vector for the final answer.", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{ \\begin{pmatrix} -42.0 & -38.6 & 0.00 & -38.6 & -42.0 & 0.00 & 42.0 \\end{pmatrix} } $$", "id": "2893077"}]}
