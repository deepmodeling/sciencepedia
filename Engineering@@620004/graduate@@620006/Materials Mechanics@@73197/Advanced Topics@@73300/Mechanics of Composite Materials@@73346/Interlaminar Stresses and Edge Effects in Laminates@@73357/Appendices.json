The traction-free condition implies that these components are zero. Specifically, for our interest:\n$$\n\\tau_{13}(z = +h/2) = 0\n$$\nSubstituting this condition into our general solution $\\tau_{13}(z) = C$:\n$$\nC = 0\n$$\nTherefore, the constant of integration is zero.

Three-dimensional equilibrium must be satisfied everywhere. The equilibrium equation relating the interlaminar normal stress $\\sigma_z$ to the interlaminar shear stresses $\\tau_{xz}$ and $\\tau_{yz}$ is:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial \\sigma_z}{\\partial z} = -\\left( \\frac{\\partial \\tau_{xz}}{\\partial x} + \\frac{\\partial \\tau_{yz}}{\\partial y} \\right)\n$$\nThese interlaminar shear stresses, $\\tau_{xz}$ and $\\tau_{yz}$, arise to balance the mismatch in in-plane stress gradients between adjacent plies near the free edge. A more direct, qualitative understanding can be achieved by considering the mismatch of in-plane stresses ($\\sigma_x, \\sigma_y, \\tau_{xy}$) between adjacent plies.\n\nAccording to CLT, for a laminate under in-plane loads $\\{N\\}$, the mid-plane strains $\\{\\varepsilon^0\\}$ are uniform through the thickness, calculated as $\\{\\varepsilon^0\\}=[A]^{-1}\\{N\\}$. The stress in an individual ply $k$ is then given in global coordinates by $\\{\\sigma\\}^{(k)} = [\\bar{Q}]^{(k)}\\{\\varepsilon^0\\}$. Because the transformed reduced stiffness matrix $[\\bar{Q}]^{(k)}$ is different for plies with different orientations, the in-plane stresses will be different in each ply, even though the strain is uniform.\n\nThis ply-level stress mismatch exists throughout the laminate. At a free edge, however, this mismatch cannot be sustained without violating equilibrium, as there are no external tractions. Consequently, a complex three-dimensional stress state, including $\\sigma_z$, $\\tau_{xz}$, and $\\tau_{yz}$, develops in a narrow boundary layer to enforce equilibrium and compatibility between the plies. The magnitude of these interlaminar stresses is directly related to the magnitude of the ply-level stress mismatch.\n\nWe are asked to compare a $[0/90]_s$ and a $[\\pm 45]_s$ laminate under a tensile load $N_x$. We must identify which laminate configuration produces a larger driving mismatch for $\\sigma_z$ near the hole boundary. The hoop stress, $\\sigma_\\theta$, is the dominant in-plane stress component near the hole. For instance, at the top and bottom of the hole (points $(0, \\pm a)$), the hoop direction coincides with the global $x$-axis, so $\\sigma_\\theta = \\sigma_x$. We will analyze the mismatch in $\\sigma_x$ at these locations.\n\nBoth $[0/90]_s$ and $[\\pm 45]_s$ are symmetric and balanced laminates, so their laminate stiffness matrices $[A]$ have $A_{16}=A_{26}=0$. Thus, a load of $N_x$ produces only normal strains $\\varepsilon_x^0$ and $\\varepsilon_y^0$ (i.e., $\\gamma_{xy}^0=0$). The ply stress is $\\sigma_x^{(k)} = \\bar{Q}_{11}^{(k)} \\varepsilon_x^0 + \\bar{Q}_{12}^{(k)} \\varepsilon_y^0$. The primary driver for mismatch in $\\sigma_x$ is the difference in $\\bar{Q}_{11}^{(k)}$ between adjacent plies.\n\nLet us calculate the lamina reduced stiffness properties $[Q]$ in material axes:\n$$ \\nu_{21} = \\nu_{12} \\frac{E_2}{E_1} = 0.30 \\frac{10}{130} \\approx 0.023 $$\n$$ Q_{11} = \\frac{E_1}{1-\\nu_{12}\\nu_{21}} = \\frac{130}{1-0.30 \\times 0.023} \\approx 130.9\\,\\mathrm{GPa} $$\n$$ Q_{22} = \\frac{E_2}{1-\\nu_{12}\\nu_{21}} = \\frac{10}{1-0.30 \\times 0.023} \\approx 10.07\\,\\mathrm{GPa} $$\n\n**Case 1: $[0/90]_s$ Laminate**\nThis laminate has interfaces between $0^\\circ$ and $90^\\circ$ plies.\nFor the $0^\\circ$ ply, the transformed stiffness $\\bar{Q}_{11}^{(0)}$ is simply $Q_{11}$.\n$$ \\bar{Q}_{11}^{(0)} = Q_{11} \\approx 130.9\\,\\mathrm{GPa} $$\nFor the $90^\\circ$ ply, the transformed stiffness $\\bar{Q}_{11}^{(90)}$ is $Q_{22}$.\n$$ \\bar{Q}_{11}^{(90)} = Q_{22} \\approx 10.07\\,\\mathrm{GPa} $$\nThere is a very large mismatch in the stiffness component that governs the primay stress response:\n$$ \\Delta \\bar{Q}_{11} = \\bar{Q}_{11}^{(0)} - \\bar{Q}_{11}^{(90)} \\approx 130.9 - 10.07 = 120.83\\,\\mathrm{GPa} $$\nThis large stiffness mismatch leads to a large mismatch in the in-plane normal stress $\\sigma_x$ between the $0^\\circ$ and $90^\\circ$ plies. This mismatch in normal stresses is a potent driver for interlaminar normal (peeling) stress, $\\sigma_z$.\n\n**Case 2: $[\\pm 45]_s$ Laminate**\nThis laminate has interfaces between $+45^\\circ$ and $-45^\\circ$ plies.\nWe must calculate the transformed stiffness $\\bar{Q}_{11}$ for a ply at an angle $\\theta$. The transformation equation is:\n$$ \\bar{Q}_{11} = Q_{11}\\cos^4\\theta + Q_{22}\\sin^4\\theta + 2(Q_{12}+2Q_{66})\\sin^2\\theta\\cos^2\\theta $$\nFor $\\theta = +45^\\circ$, $\\cos\\theta=1/\\sqrt{2}$ and $\\sin\\theta=1/\\sqrt{2}$.\nFor $\\theta = -45^\\circ$, $\\cos\\theta=1/\\sqrt{2}$ and $\\sin\\theta=-1/\\sqrt{2}$.\nSince all terms in the equation for $\\bar{Q}_{11}$ involve even powers of $\\sin\\theta$ (i.e., $\\sin^2\\theta$ and $\\sin^4\\theta$), the value of $\\bar{Q}_{11}$ is identical for $+45^\\circ$ and $-45^\\circ$.\n$$ \\bar{Q}_{11}^{(+45)} = \\bar{Q}_{11}^{(-45)} $$\nTherefore, there is **zero mismatch** in the stiffness component $\\bar{Q}_{11}$. This means that for a given strain state $(\\varepsilon_x^0, \\varepsilon_y^0)$, the normal stresses $\\sigma_x$ and $\\sigma_y$ are identical in the adjacent $+45^\\circ$ and $-45^\\circ$ plies.\nA mismatch does exist, however, in the in-plane shear stress $\\tau_{xy}$, because the sign of the shear-coupling terms $\\bar{Q}_{16}$ and $\\bar{Q}_{26}$ flips between $+45^\\circ$ and $-45^\\circ$.\n$$ \\bar{Q}_{16}^{(+45)} = - \\bar{Q}_{16}^{(-45)} \\neq 0 $$\nThis mismatch in $\\tau_{xy}$ also generates interlaminar stresses. However, the mechanism initiated by a mismatch in shear stress, $\\tau_{xy}$, is known to be a significantly weaker driver for generating interlaminar normal stress $\\sigma_z$ compared to the mechanism initiated by a large mismatch in in-plane normal stresses, $\\sigma_x$ or $\\sigma_y$.\n\n**Conclusion**\nThe $[0/90]_s$ laminate features a large mismatch in normal stiffness properties ($E_1$ vs. $E_2$) between adjacent plies. This results in a large mismatch in the concentrated hoop stress at the hole edge. This stress mismatch is the primary cause of high interlaminar normal stress $\\sigma_z$. The $[\\pm 45]_s$ laminate, by contrast, has no mismatch in normal stiffness between adjacent plies, and thus no mismatch in normal stresses, leading to a much lower peak $\\sigma_z$.\n\n**Option-by-Option Analysis**\n\n**A. The $[0/90]_s$ laminate exhibits a higher peak $\\sigma_z$ because adjacent $0^\\circ$ and $90^\\circ$ plies develop a large mismatch in global in-plane normal stress near the hole, and three-dimensional equilibrium then requires a larger through-thickness stress concentration to enforce compatibility at the interface.**\nThis statement accurately identifies the laminate with the higher stress ($[0/90]_s$) and provides the correct physical explanation: the large mismatch in in-plane normal stress (e.g. hoop stress) between the stiff $0^\\circ$ plies and the compliant $90^\\circ$ plies at the free edge. This mismatch is what drives the high interlaminar normal stress required by 3D equilibrium.\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\n**B. The $[\\pm 45]_s$ laminate exhibits a higher peak $\\sigma_z$ because shear coupling concentrates load along $\\pm 45^\\circ$ directions, increasing out-of-plane stress at the hole boundary relative to a cross-ply.**\nThis statement is incorrect. As derived, the $[0/90]_s$ laminate experiences higher peak $\\sigma_z$. While ply-level shear coupling exists in the $[\\pm 45]_s$ laminate and creates a mismatch in $\\tau_{xy}$, this is a less potent mechanism for generating $\\sigma_z$ than the normal stress mismatch in the $[0/90]_s$ case.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**C. The peak $\\sigma_z$ is approximately the same for both laminates because symmetric stacking suppresses out-of-plane normal stresses near holes regardless of ply angle.**\nThis statement is incorrect. The peak $\\sigma_z$ is highly dependent on the ply orientation and the resulting stiffness mismatches. Symmetry in the stacking sequence eliminates certain coupling terms in the laminate constitutive equations (e.g., $[B]=0$), but it does not suppress or eliminate interlaminar stresses at free edges.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. The peak $\\sigma_z$ depends only on the ratio $a/h$ and not on ply orientation; therefore, both laminates have the same peak $\\sigma_z$ under the same $N_x$.**\nThis statement is fundamentally incorrect. The phenomenon of interlaminar stress is a direct consequence of material anisotropy and the stacking of plies with different orientations. Therefore, $\\sigma_z$ is critically dependent on the ply stacking sequence, not just on geometric ratios.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2894717"}, {"introduction": "Moving from qualitative reasoning to quantitative analysis, this practice guides you through the process of estimating the magnitude of peak interlaminar shear stress using a simplified analytical model for a $[0^\\circ/90^\\circ]_s$ laminate.

We are interested in its magnitude:\n$$\n\\tau_{xz,\\max} = |\\tau_{xz}(0)| = \\frac{1}{2} \\kappa S_{\\infty}\n$$\nSubstituting the expression for $S_{\\infty}$:\n$$\n\\tau_{xz,\\max} = \\frac{1}{2} \\kappa \\left( \\frac{1}{2} \\frac{Q_{11} - Q_{22}}{Q_{11} + Q_{22}} N_x \\right) = \\frac{\\kappa}{4} \\frac{Q_{11} - Q_{22}}{Q_{11} + Q_{22}} N_x\n$$\nThe problem asks for the nondimensional ratio $\\tau_{xz,\\max}/(N_x/h)$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\tau_{xz,\\max}}{N_x/h} = \\frac{\\frac{\\kappa}{4} \\frac{Q_{11} - Q_{22}}{Q_{11} + Q_{22}} N_x}{N_x/h} = \\frac{\\kappa h}{4} \\frac{Q_{11} - Q_{22}}{Q_{11} + Q_{22}}\n$$\nWe are given the approximation $\\kappa \\approx \\pi/h$. Substituting this into the ratio:\n$$\n\\frac{\\tau_{xz,\\max}}{N_x/h} = \\frac{(\\pi/h) h}{4} \\frac{Q_{11} - Q_{22}}{Q_{11} + Q_{22}} = \\frac{\\pi}{4} \\frac{Q_{11} - Q_{22}}{Q_{11} + Q_{22}}\n$$\nThe stiffness ratio can be simplified by substituting the definitions of $Q_{11}$ and $Q_{22}$:\n$$\n\\frac{Q_{11} - Q_{22}}{Q_{11} + Q_{22}} = \\frac{\\frac{E_1}{1 - \\nu_{12}\\nu_{21}} - \\frac{E_2}{1 - \\nu_{12}\\nu_{21}}}{\\frac{E_1}{1 - \\nu_{12}\\nu_{21}} + \\frac{E_2}{1 - \\nu_{12}\\nu_{21}}} = \\frac{E_1 - E_2}{E_1 + E_2}\n$$\nThus, the final analytical estimate for the nondimensional peak shear stress is:\n$$\n\\frac{\\tau_{xz,\\max}}{N_x/h} = \\frac{\\pi}{4} \\frac{E_1 - E_2}{E_1 + E_2}\n$$\nNow, we evaluate this expression numerically using the given material properties: $E_1 = 135 \\ \\mathrm{GPa}$ and $E_2 = 10 \\ \\mathrm{GPa}$.\n$$\n\\frac{\\tau_{xz,\\max}}{N_x/h} = \\frac{\\pi}{4} \\frac{135 - 10}{135 + 10} = \\frac{\\pi}{4} \\frac{125}{145} = \\frac{\\pi}{4} \\frac{25}{29}\n$$\nCalculating the value:\n$$\n\\frac{\\tau_{xz,\\max}}{N_x/h} \\approx \\frac{3.14159265}{4} \\times \\frac{25}{29} \\approx 0.785398 \\times 0.862069 \\approx 0.677067\n$$\nRounding the result to four significant figures, we get $0.6771$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.6771}$$", "id": "2894716"}]}
