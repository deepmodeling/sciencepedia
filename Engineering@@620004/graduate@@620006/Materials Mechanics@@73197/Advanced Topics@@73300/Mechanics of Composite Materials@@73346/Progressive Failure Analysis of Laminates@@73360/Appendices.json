From the third, $\\gamma_{xy}^0 = 0$. Substituting $\\epsilon_y^0$ into the first equation yields:\n$N_x = (A_{11} - \\frac{A_{12}^2}{A_{11}})\\epsilon_x^0$.\nSolving for the mid-plane strains in terms of $N_x$:\n$$\n\\epsilon_x^0 = \\frac{N_x A_{11}}{A_{11}^2 - A_{12}^2} \\\\\n\\epsilon_y^0 = -\\frac{N_x A_{12}}{A_{11}^2 - A_{12}^2}\n$$\nFor a symmetric laminate under pure membrane loading, the strain is constant through the thickness, so the strain in any ply $k$ is $\\{\\boldsymbol{\\epsilon}\\}_k = \\{\\boldsymbol{\\epsilon}^0\\}$. The stress in the local material coordinates of each ply is found by first transforming the global strains $\\{\\boldsymbol{\\epsilon}^0\\}$ to local ply strains $\\{\\boldsymbol{\\epsilon'}\\}$ and then applying the material stiffness matrix $[Q]$.\n\nFor the $0^\\circ$ plies ($\\theta = 0^\\circ$), the local strains are identical to the global strains: $\\{\\boldsymbol{\\epsilon'}\\}_0 = \\{\\boldsymbol{\\epsilon}^0\\}$. The stress component in the fiber direction, $\\sigma'_1$, is:\n$$\n(\\sigma'_1)_0 = Q_{11}\\epsilon_x^0 + Q_{12}\\epsilon_y^0 = (Q_{11} A_{11} - Q_{12} A_{12}) \\frac{N_x}{A_{11}^2 - A_{12}^2}\n$$\nFiber-dominated failure in these plies occurs when $(\\sigma'_1)_0$ reaches the fiber tensile strength $X_t$. The corresponding critical load resultant, $N_x^{0F}$, is:\n$$\nN_x^{0F} = X_t \\frac{A_{11}^2 - A_{12}^2}{Q_{11}A_{11} - Q_{12}A_{12}}\n$$\nFor the $90^\\circ$ plies ($\\theta = 90^\\circ$), the transformation from global to local strains is $\\epsilon'_1 = \\epsilon_y^0$, $\\epsilon'_2 = \\epsilon_x^0$, and $\\gamma'_{12} = -\\gamma_{xy}^0 = 0$. Matrix cracking is governed by the tensile stress transverse to the fibers, $\\sigma'_2$, reaching the transverse tensile strength $Y_t$. The stress $(\\sigma'_2)_{90}$ is:\n$$\n(\\sigma'_2)_{90} = Q_{12}\\epsilon'_1 + Q_{22}\\epsilon'_2 = Q_{12}\\epsilon_y^0 + Q_{22}\\epsilon_x^0 = (-Q_{12} A_{12} + Q_{22} A_{11}) \\frac{N_x}{A_{11}^2 - A_{12}^2}\n$$\nMatrix cracking in these plies initiates when $(\\sigma'_2)_{90}$ reaches $Y_t$. The corresponding critical load resultant, $N_x^{90M}$, is:\n$$\nN_x^{90M} = Y_t \\frac{A_{11}^2 - A_{12}^2}{Q_{22}A_{11} - Q_{12}A_{12}}\n$$\nFiber failure in the $0^\\circ$ plies occurs before matrix cracking in the $90^\\circ$ plies if and only if $N_x^{0F} < N_x^{90M}$. Comparing the expressions for the critical loads:\n$$\nX_t \\frac{A_{11}^2 - A_{12}^2}{Q_{11}A_{11} - Q_{12}A_{12}} < Y_t \\frac{A_{11}^2 - A_{12}^2}{Q_{22}A_{11} - Q_{12}A_{12}}\n$$\nSince $A_{11}^2 - A_{12}^2 > 0$, we can simplify this inequality to:\n$$\n\\frac{X_t}{Y_t} < \\frac{Q_{11}A_{11} - Q_{12}A_{12}}{Q_{22}A_{11} - Q_{12}A_{12}}\n$$\nThe critical strength ratio $R_{\\mathrm{crit}}$ is therefore defined by the right-hand side of this inequality.\n$$\nR_{\\mathrm{crit}} = \\frac{Q_{11}A_{11} - Q_{12}A_{12}}{Q_{22}A_{11} - Q_{12}A_{12}}\n$$\nSubstituting the expressions for $A_{11}$ and $A_{12}$ in terms of $Q_{ij}$ and canceling the common factor $2h$:\n$$\nR_{\\mathrm{crit}} = \\frac{Q_{11}(2h(Q_{11} + Q_{22})) - Q_{12}(4h Q_{12})}{Q_{22}(2h(Q_{11} + Q_{22})) - Q_{12}(4h Q_{12})} = \\frac{Q_{11}^2 + Q_{11}Q_{22} - 2Q_{12}^2}{Q_{11}Q_{22} + Q_{22}^2 - 2Q_{12}^2}\n$$\nThis is the required closed-form expression. To evaluate it numerically, we first compute the lamina stiffness components $Q_{ij}$ from the given elastic properties: $E_1 = 320\\,\\mathrm{GPa}$, $E_2 = 8.0\\,\\mathrm{GPa}$, $\\nu_{12} = 0.25$.\nFirst, $\\nu_{21} = \\nu_{12} \\frac{E_2}{E_1} = 0.25 \\times \\frac{8.0}{320} = 0.00625$.\nThe term $1 - \\nu_{12}\\nu_{21} = 1 - 0.25 \\times 0.00625 = 1 - 0.0015625 = 0.9984375$.\nThe stiffness components are:\n$Q_{11} = \\frac{320}{0.9984375}\\,\\mathrm{GPa}$\n$Q_{22} = \\frac{8.0}{0.9984375}\\,\\mathrm{GPa}$\n$Q_{12} = \\frac{0.25 \\times 8.0}{0.9984375} = \\frac{2.0}{0.9984375}\\,\\mathrm{GPa}$\n\nSubstituting these into the expression for $R_{\\mathrm{crit}}$, the common factor $(1-\\nu_{12}\\nu_{21})^{-2}$ cancels from the numerator and denominator. We can thus compute $R_{\\mathrm{crit}}$ directly from the engineering constants:\n$$\nR_{\\mathrm{crit}} = \\frac{E_1^2 + E_1 E_2 - 2(\\nu_{12}E_2)^2}{E_1 E_2 + E_2^2 - 2(\\nu_{12}E_2)^2}\n$$\nUsing the given values:\n$E_1^2 = (320)^2 = 102400$\n$E_1 E_2 = 320 \\times 8.0= 2560$\n$E_2^2 = (8.0)^2 = 64$\n$(\\nu_{12} E_2)^2 = (0.25 \\times 8.0)^2 = 2.0^2 = 4.0$\n\nSubstituting these values into the expression:\n$$\nR_{\\mathrm{crit}} = \\frac{102400 + 2560 - 2(4.0)}{2560 + 64 - 2(4.0)} = \\frac{104960 - 8.0}{2624 - 8.0} = \\frac{104952}{2616}\n$$\n$R_{\\mathrm{crit}} = 40.119266...$\nRounding the result to four significant figures gives $40.12$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{40.12}$$", "id": "2912902"}]}
