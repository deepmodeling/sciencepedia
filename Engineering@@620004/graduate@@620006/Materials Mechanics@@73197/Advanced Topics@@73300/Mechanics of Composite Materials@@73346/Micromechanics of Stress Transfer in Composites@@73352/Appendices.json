A solution will be derived.\n\nThe governing equation for the out-of-plane displacement $w$ in an isotropic, linear elastic material under antiplane shear is derived from the equilibrium equation $\\nabla \\cdot \\boldsymbol{\\sigma} = 0$. The only non-zero stress components are $\\tau_{xz} = G \\frac{\\partial w}{\\partial x}$ and $\\tau_{yz} = G \\frac{\\partial w}{\\partial y}$, where $G$ is the shear modulus. The equilibrium equation reduces to $\\frac{\\partial \\tau_{xz}}{\\partial x} + \\frac{\\partial \\tau_{yz}}{\\partial y} = 0$. Since the shear modulus is constant within each phase (matrix or inclusion), this becomes Laplace's equation for the displacement field:\n$$ \\nabla^2 w = \\frac{\\partial^2 w}{\\partial x^2} + \\frac{\\partial^2 w}{\\partial y^2} = 0 $$\nThis equation holds in both the inclusion ($r < a$) and the matrix ($r > a$). Due to the cylindrical geometry, we work in polar coordinates $(r, \\theta)$, where $x=r\\cos\\theta$ and $y=r\\sin\\theta$. The governing equation is:\n$$ \\nabla^2 w = \\frac{1}{r} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial r} \\left(r \\frac{\\partial w}{\\partial r}\\right) + \\frac{1}{r^2} \\frac{\\partial^2 w}{\\partial \\theta^2} = 0 $$\nThe far-field boundary condition is $w \\to \\gamma_0 y = \\gamma_0 r \\sin\\theta$ as $r \\to \\infty$.\n\nWe propose solutions for the displacement field inside the inclusion, $w_i(r,\\theta)$ for $r \\le a$, and in the matrix, $w_m(r,\\theta)$ for $r \\ge a$.\n\nFor the matrix ($r \\ge a$), the solution must approach the far-field behavior. The general solution consists of the uniform field plus a perturbation that must decay as $r \\to \\infty$. Guided by the $\\sin\\theta$ dependence of the far-field condition, we seek a solution of the form:\n$$ w_m(r, \\theta) = \\gamma_0 r \\sin\\theta + D_m r^{-1} \\sin\\theta $$\nThis form satisfies Laplace's equation and the far-field condition. The term $D_m r^{-1} \\sin\\theta$ represents the perturbation due to the inclusion.\n\nFor the inclusion ($r \\le a$), the displacement must remain finite at the origin ($r=0$). This eliminates terms like $r^{-n}$ and $\\ln(r)$. The solution must match the angular dependence of the exterior field at the boundary. Therefore, we propose a solution of the form:\n$$ w_i(r, \\theta) = C_i r \\sin\\theta $$\nThis form satisfies Laplace's equation and is regular at the origin.\n\nThe unknown coefficients $C_i$ and $D_m$ are determined by applying the perfect bonding conditions at the interface $r=a$.\n1.  **Continuity of displacement**: $w_m(a, \\theta) = w_i(a, \\theta)$\n    $$ \\gamma_0 a \\sin\\theta + D_m a^{-1} \\sin\\theta = C_i a \\sin\\theta $$\n    Dividing by $a\\sin\\theta$ (for $\\theta \\ne 0, \\pi$) yields:\n    $$ \\gamma_0 + D_m a^{-2} = C_i \\quad (1) $$\n2.  **Continuity of traction**: The only non-zero traction component on the cylindrical surface is the radial shear stress, $\\tau_{rz}$. The condition is $\\tau_{rz}^{(m)}(a, \\theta) = \\tau_{rz}^{(i)}(a, \\theta)$. In polar coordinates, $\\tau_{rz} = G \\frac{\\partial w}{\\partial r}$.\n    $$ G_m \\frac{\\partial w_m}{\\partial r}\\bigg|_{r=a} = G_i \\frac{\\partial w_i}{\\partial r}\\bigg|_{r=a} $$\n    We compute the derivatives:\n    $$ \\frac{\\partial w_m}{\\partial r} = \\gamma_0 \\sin\\theta - D_m r^{-2} \\sin\\theta $$\n    $$ \\frac{\\partial w_i}{\\partial r} = C_i \\sin\\theta $$\n    Evaluating at $r=a$ and substituting into the traction continuity condition:\n    $$ G_m (\\gamma_0 \\sin\\theta - D_m a^{-2} \\sin\\theta) = G_i (C_i \\sin\\theta) $$\n    Dividing by $\\sin\\theta$:\n    $$ G_m (\\gamma_0 - D_m a^{-2}) = G_i C_i \\quad (2) $$\n\nNow we solve the system of linear equations ($1$) and ($2$) for $C_i$ and $D_m$. Substitute ($1$) into ($2$):\n$$ G_m (\\gamma_0 - D_m a^{-2}) = G_i (\\gamma_0 + D_m a^{-2}) $$\n$$ (G_m - G_i)\\gamma_0 = (G_m + G_i) D_m a^{-2} $$\n$$ D_m = a^2 \\gamma_0 \\frac{G_m - G_i}{G_m + G_i} $$\nSubstitute $D_m$ back into ($1$):\n$$ C_i = \\gamma_0 + \\left( a^2 \\gamma_0 \\frac{G_m - G_i}{G_m + G_i} \\right) a^{-2} = \\gamma_0 \\left( 1 + \\frac{G_m - G_i}{G_m + G_i} \\right) = \\gamma_0 \\frac{G_m + G_i + G_m - G_i}{G_m + G_i} $$\n$$ C_i = \\frac{2 G_m \\gamma_0}{G_m + G_i} $$\nThe derived forms of the solution are:\n$$ w_i(r,\\theta) = \\left( \\frac{2 G_m \\gamma_0}{G_m + G_i} \\right) r \\sin\\theta \\quad \\text{for } r \\le a $$\n$$ w_m(r,\\theta) = \\gamma_0 r \\sin\\theta + \\left( \\gamma_0 a^2 \\frac{G_m - G_i}{G_m + G_i} \\right) \\frac{\\sin\\theta}{r} \\quad \\text{for } r \\ge a $$\n\n(a) To show that the inclusion strain tends to zero for a rigid inclusion ($G_i \\to \\infty$), we first evaluate the strain components inside the inclusion. The non-zero strain components are $\\epsilon_{xz}^{(i)}$ and $\\epsilon_{yz}^{(i)}$.\nSince $w_i = C_i y$, the derivatives are $\\frac{\\partial w_i}{\\partial x} = 0$ and $\\frac{\\partial w_i}{\\partial y} = C_i$.\nThe strains are $\\epsilon_{xz}^{(i)} = \\frac{1}{2}\\frac{\\partial w_i}{\\partial x} = 0$ and $\\epsilon_{yz}^{(i)} = \\frac{1}{2}\\frac{\\partial w_i}{\\partial y} = \\frac{1}{2} C_i$.\nThe strain state is thus determined by the coefficient $C_i$. We take the limit of $C_i$ as $G_i \\to \\infty$:\n$$ \\lim_{G_i \\to \\infty} C_i = \\lim_{G_i \\to \\infty} \\frac{2 G_m \\gamma_0}{G_m + G_i} = 0 $$\nSince $C_i \\to 0$, the strain component $\\epsilon_{yz}^{(i)} \\to 0$. All strain components in the inclusion are zero in this limit. This is consistent with the definition of a rigid body, which does not deform.\n\n(b) To compute the perturbation stress field in the matrix for the rigid-inclusion limit ($G_i \\to \\infty$), we first identify the perturbation displacement, $w^{\\mathrm{pert}}$. The total matrix displacement is $w_m = w^{\\infty} + w^{\\mathrm{pert}}$, where $w^{\\infty} = \\gamma_0 r \\sin\\theta$ is the far-field displacement.\nThus, the perturbation is:\n$$ w^{\\mathrm{pert}}(r, \\theta) = D_m r^{-1} \\sin\\theta $$\nWe evaluate the coefficient $D_m$ in the limit $G_i \\to \\infty$:\n$$ \\lim_{G_i \\to \\infty} D_m = \\lim_{G_i \\to \\infty} \\left( a^2 \\gamma_0 \\frac{G_m - G_i}{G_m + G_i} \\right) = a^2 \\gamma_0 \\lim_{G_i \\to \\infty} \\frac{G_i(\\frac{G_m}{G_i} - 1)}{G_i(\\frac{G_m}{G_i} + 1)} = a^2 \\gamma_0 \\frac{-1}{1} = -a^2 \\gamma_0 $$\nThe perturbation displacement field for the rigid inclusion case is:\n$$ w^{\\mathrm{pert}}(r, \\theta) = -a^2 \\gamma_0 r^{-1} \\sin\\theta $$\nThe perturbation stress components in the matrix are given by $\\tau_{rz}^{\\mathrm{pert}} = G_m \\frac{\\partial w^{\\mathrm{pert}}}{\\partial r}$ and $\\tau_{\\theta z}^{\\mathrm{pert}} = G_m \\frac{1}{r} \\frac{\\partial w^{\\mathrm{pert}}}{\\partial \\theta}$. We compute the derivatives:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial w^{\\mathrm{pert}}}{\\partial r} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial r} (-a^2 \\gamma_0 r^{-1} \\sin\\theta) = a^2 \\gamma_0 r^{-2} \\sin\\theta $$\n$$ \\frac{\\partial w^{\\mathrm{pert}}}{\\partial \\theta} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\theta} (-a^2 \\gamma_0 r^{-1} \\sin\\theta) = -a^2 \\gamma_0 r^{-1} \\cos\\theta $$\nThe perturbation stresses are therefore:\n$$ \\tau_{rz}^{\\mathrm{pert}}(r,\\theta) = G_m (a^2 \\gamma_0 r^{-2} \\sin\\theta) = G_m \\gamma_0 \\frac{a^2}{r^2} \\sin\\theta $$\n$$ \\tau_{\\theta z}^{\\mathrm{pert}}(r,\\theta) = G_m \\frac{1}{r} (-a^2 \\gamma_0 r^{-1} \\cos\\theta) = -G_m \\gamma_0 \\frac{a^2}{r^2} \\cos\\theta $$\nThe pair of perturbation stresses $(\\tau_{rz}^{\\mathrm{pert}}, \\tau_{\\theta z}^{\\mathrm{pert}})$ is the final required result.

It is a standard, albeit simplified, exercise in inverse parameter estimation within the field of materials mechanics. A solution will be provided based on the specified first principles.\n\n**Derivation and Solution**\n\nThe problem requires a two-part solution where the two unknowns, $\\tau_i$ and $E_m$, are estimated from two independent sets of experimental data. The derivations are presented sequentially.\n\n**1. Estimation of Interfacial Shear Strength ($\\tau_i$)**\n\nThe estimation of $\\tau_i$ is based on the single-fiber fragmentation test data. The core assumption is the constant shear-lag model.\n\nConsider a single fiber of radius $r$ embedded in a matrix. At a fiber break, the axial stress in the fiber is zero. Stress is built up along the fiber length $x$ away from the break via shear stress $\\tau_i$ at the fiber-matrix interface. An axial force balance on a differential fiber element of length $dx$ yields:\n$$\ndF_f = \\tau_i \\cdot dA_s\n$$\nwhere $dF_f$ is the change in axial force in the fiber and $dA_s = 2\\pi r \\, dx$ is the interfacial surface area of the element. The axial force is related to the fiber stress $\\sigma_f$ by $F_f = \\sigma_f A_f$, where $A_f = \\pi r^2$ is the fiber cross-sectional area. Thus, $dF_f = A_f d\\sigma_f$. Substituting this into the force balance gives:\n$$\n(\\pi r^2) d\\sigma_f = \\tau_i (2\\pi r) dx\n$$\nRearranging gives the gradient of the fiber stress:\n$$\n\\frac{d\\sigma_f}{dx} = \\frac{2\\tau_i}{r}\n$$\nSince $\\tau_i$ and $r$ are assumed constant, the stress profile is linear: $\\sigma_f(x) = \\frac{2\\tau_i}{r}x$, where $x$ is the distance from the fiber break.\n\nThe process of fragmentation continues until the fragments are too short to be broken further. A fragment of length $\\ell$ can be broken only if the maximum stress at its center reaches the fiber's ultimate tensile strength, $\\sigma_{fu}$. The stress at the center ($x=\\ell/2$) is built up from both ends, reaching a maximum of:\n$$\n\\sigma_{f,\\text{max}} = \\frac{2\\tau_i}{r} \\left(\\frac{\\ell}{2}\\right) = \\frac{\\tau_i \\ell}{r}\n$$\nThe condition for a new break to be possible is $\\sigma_{f,\\text{max}} \\ge \\sigma_{fu}$. This defines a critical length, $\\ell_c$, below which no further breakage can occur:\n$$\n\\ell_c = \\frac{\\sigma_{fu} r}{\\tau_i}\n$$\nThe problem stipulates that the measured saturated fragment lengths, $\\{\\ell_i\\}$, are samples from an exponential probability distribution with a mean equal to this critical length, $\\ell_c$. For an exponential distribution, the maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) for its mean is the sample arithmetic mean. Therefore, we estimate the critical length, $\\hat{\\ell}_c$, by computing the average of the observed fragment lengths:\n$$\n\\hat{\\ell}_c = \\langle \\ell \\rangle = \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{i=1}^N \\ell_i\n$$\nBy substituting this estimator into the equation for the critical length and rearranging, we obtain the estimator for the interfacial shear strength:\n$$\n\\hat{\\tau}_i = \\frac{\\sigma_{fu} r}{\\hat{\\ell}_c} = \\frac{\\sigma_{fu} r}{\\langle \\ell \\rangle}\n$$\n\n**2. Estimation of Matrix Modulus ($E_m$)**\n\nThe estimation of $E_m$ is based on the measured overall composite modulus, $E_c$. The governing principle is the iso-strain assumption, which is the foundation of the 'rule of mixtures' for the longitudinal modulus of a continuous, aligned fiber composite.\n\nThe iso-strain condition states that the strain is uniform throughout the composite and its constituents under axial loading:\n$$\n\\epsilon_c = \\epsilon_f = \\epsilon_m = \\epsilon\n$$\nThe total axial force on the composite, $F_c$, is the sum of the forces carried by the fibers, $F_f$, and the matrix, $F_m$:\n$$\nF_c = F_f + F_m\n$$\nDividing by the total cross-sectional area of the composite, $A_c$, gives the relationship for the overall stress, $\\sigma_c$:\n$$\n\\sigma_c = \\frac{F_c}{A_c} = \\frac{F_f}{A_c} + \\frac{F_m}{A_c} = \\sigma_f \\frac{A_f}{A_c} + \\sigma_m \\frac{A_m}{A_c}\n$$\nFor a unidirectional composite, the area fractions are equal to the volume fractions: $V_f = A_f/A_c$ and $V_m = A_m/A_c = 1 - V_f$. The stress equation becomes:\n$$\n\\sigma_c = \\sigma_f V_f + \\sigma_m (1 - V_f)\n$$\nUsing the linear elastic constitutive relation $\\sigma = E\\epsilon$ for each component:\n$$\nE_c \\epsilon_c = (E_f \\epsilon_f) V_f + (E_m \\epsilon_m) (1 - V_f)\n$$\nGiven the iso-strain condition, the strain term $\\epsilon$ cancels from the equation, yielding the rule of mixtures:\n$$\nE_c = E_f V_f + E_m (1 - V_f)\n$$\nThis equation can be rearranged to solve for the unknown matrix modulus, $E_m$, using the measured value of $E_c$ and the known properties $E_f$ and $V_f$:\n$$\nE_m (1 - V_f) = E_c - E_f V_f \\implies E_m = \\frac{E_c - E_f V_f}{1 - V_f}\n$$\n\n**3.

Building upon a refined shear-lag model, you will use Monte Carlo simulation to propagate the uncertainty in interfacial shear strength through to the composite's effective modulus and length efficiency factor, providing a robust, probabilistic assessment of material performance.", "problem": "You are to write a complete, runnable program that performs uncertainty propagation in a one-dimensional shear-lag model for an aligned short-fiber composite with an imperfect interface treated as a linear cohesive layer up to a characteristic slip. The uncertain input is the interfacial shear strength, modeled as a normally distributed random variable, and the outputs are the distributional statistics of the length efficiency factor and the effective axial modulus. The derivation must be based solely on fundamental mechanics: local force equilibrium, kinematic compatibility, and linear elasticity.\n\nAssumptions and modeling framework:\n- Consider a single cylindrical fiber of radius $r_f$ and length $L$ embedded in a matrix, aligned with the loading direction, in a unidirectional composite loaded in axial tension. The fiber occupies volume fraction $V_f$ and the matrix occupies $V_m = 1 - V_f$.\n- The fiber is linear elastic with axial modulus $E_f$; the matrix is linear elastic with axial modulus $E_m$. The far-field composite is subjected to a macroscopically uniform axial strain $ \\varepsilon_c $ that is small enough to ensure linear response of all phases.\n- The interface is modeled as a linear cohesive shear spring up to a characteristic interfacial slip $ \\delta_c $; the interfacial shear traction $ \\tau $ is proportional to the interfacial slip $ \\Delta u $ through an interfacial shear stiffness per unit area $ k_{\\text{int}} $, i.e., $ \\tau = k_{\\text{int}} \\, \\Delta u $, with $ k_{\\text{int}} = \\tau_i / \\delta_c $. Here $ \\tau_i $ is the interfacial shear strength, treated as a random variable. This modeling choice ties the small-strain interfacial stiffness to the shear strength via the characteristic slip $ \\delta_c $, a deterministic parameter. The interface is assumed to remain in the linear regime for the considered $ \\varepsilon_c $; no interfacial softening is invoked in this problem.\n\nDerivation base you must use:\n- Axial force equilibrium of a differential fiber segment: if $ \\sigma_f(x) $ is the fiber axial stress and $ A_f = \\pi r_f^2 $ is the fiber cross-sectional area, then for a segment of length $ dx $, $ A_f \\, d \\sigma_f = p \\, \\tau \\, dx $, where $ p = 2 \\pi r_f $ is the fiber perimeter and $ \\tau $ is the interfacial shear traction.\n- Linear elasticity in the fiber: $ \\sigma_f = E_f \\, \\varepsilon_f = E_f \\, \\dfrac{d u_f}{dx} $, where $ u_f(x) $ is the fiber axial displacement.\n- Kinematic compatibility for the matrix: under a prescribed macroscopic axial strain $ \\varepsilon_c $, take the matrix axial displacement field as $ u_m(x) = \\varepsilon_c \\, x $ to leading order in a dilute fiber approximation.\n- Interfacial constitutive law as given above: $ \\tau = k_{\\text{int}} (u_f - u_m) $ with $ k_{\\text{int}} = \\tau_i / \\delta_c $.\n\nFrom these bases, you must derive the governing linear ordinary differential equation for the relative displacement $ w(x) = u_f(x) - u_m(x) $, apply boundary conditions consistent with free fiber ends (zero axial force at $ x = \\pm L/2 $), solve for the fiber stress profile $ \\sigma_f(x) $, and deduce the length efficiency factor $ \\eta_l $ defined as the ratio of the average fiber stress under $ \\varepsilon_c $ to the uniform fiber stress $ E_f \\varepsilon_c $ that would occur under perfect iso-strain.

Use a fixed pseudo-random seed so that results are reproducible.\n- For each test case, compute the sample mean and sample standard deviation of $ \\eta_l $ and of $ E_{\\text{eff}} $.\n\nUnits, numerical instructions, and output specification:\n- Use International System of Units (SI) internally. Input parameters are given in mixed engineering units; convert them to SI before computation.\n- Express the effective modulus $ E_{\\text{eff}} $ in gigapascals (GPa) in the final output. Express $ \\eta_l $ as a dimensionless number.\n- Use a Monte Carlo sample size of $ N = 200{,}000 $ for each test case and a fixed seed $ s = 123456 $.\n- Report the sample mean and standard deviation of $ E_{\\text{eff}} $ and $ \\eta_l $ rounded to $ 6 $ decimal places.\n\nTest suite (parameter sets):\nEach test case is a tuple $ (\\mu_{\\tau}, \\sigma_{\\tau}, E_f, E_m, r_f, L, V_f, \\delta_c) $ with units indicated.

It presents a standard exercise in the micromechanics of materials, founded upon the classical shear-lag theory of Cox. The assumptions, while simplifying, are explicit and consistent, constituting a valid framework for analysis. We shall therefore proceed with the derivation and solution.\n\nThe objective is to derive the statistical properties of the length efficiency factor, $\\eta_l$, and the effective axial modulus, $E_{\\text{eff}}$, for a short-fiber composite, where the interfacial shear strength, $\\tau_i$, is a random variable. The derivation will follow from first principles as specified.\n\nFirst, we establish the governing ordinary differential equation for the stress transfer from matrix to fiber. The axial force equilibrium for a differential fiber element of length $dx$ is given as:\n$$\nA_f \\, d\\sigma_f = p \\, \\tau \\, dx\n$$\nwhere $A_f = \\pi r_f^2$ is the fiber cross-sectional area, $\\sigma_f(x)$ is the axial stress in the fiber at position $x$, $p = 2 \\pi r_f$ is the fiber perimeter, and $\\tau(x)$ is the interfacial shear stress. This can be rewritten as:\n$$\n\\frac{d\\sigma_f}{dx} = \\frac{p}{A_f} \\tau = \\frac{2}{r_f} \\tau\n$$\nThe fiber is linear elastic, thus $\\sigma_f(x) = E_f \\varepsilon_f(x) = E_f \\frac{du_f}{dx}$, where $E_f$ is the fiber's elastic modulus and $u_f(x)$ is the axial displacement of the fiber. Differentiating this gives $\\frac{d\\sigma_f}{dx} = E_f \\frac{d^2u_f}{dx^2}$.\nSubstituting this into the equilibrium equation yields:\n$$\nE_f \\frac{d^2u_f}{dx^2} = \\frac{2}{r_f} \\tau\n$$\nThe problem specifies a linear cohesive interface model, $\\tau = k_{\\text{int}} \\Delta u$, where $\\Delta u = u_f - u_m$ is the slip, or relative displacement, between the fiber and the matrix. The matrix displacement is approximated as $u_m(x) = \\varepsilon_c x$ for a far-field strain $\\varepsilon_c$. Substituting for $\\tau$:\n$$\nE_f \\frac{d^2u_f}{dx^2} = \\frac{2 k_{\\text{int}}}{r_f} (u_f - u_m)\n$$\nTo simplify, we introduce the relative displacement $w(x) = u_f(x) - u_m(x)$. It follows that $u_f(x) = w(x) + u_m(x) = w(x) + \\varepsilon_c x$. The derivatives are $\\frac{du_f}{dx} = \\frac{dw}{dx} + \\varepsilon_c$ and $\\frac{d^2u_f}{dx^2} = \\frac{d^2w}{dx^2}$. Substituting these into the equation:\n$$\nE_f \\frac{d^2w}{dx^2} = \\frac{2 k_{\\text{int}}}{r_f} w(x)\n$$\nThis is rearranged into the standard form of a second-order linear homogeneous ODE:\n$$\n\\frac{d^2w}{dx^2} - \\beta^2 w(x) = 0\n$$\nwhere the shear-lag parameter $\\beta$ is defined by $\\beta^2 = \\frac{2 k_{\\text{int}}}{r_f E_f}$.\n\nNext, we apply the boundary conditions. The fiber has a length $L$, and we set the origin at its center, so the domain is $x \\in [-L/2, L/2]$. The fiber ends are free, meaning the axial stress is zero: $\\sigma_f(\\pm L/2) = 0$.\nUsing the relation $\\sigma_f(x) = E_f \\frac{du_f}{dx} = E_f \\left(\\frac{dw}{dx} + \\varepsilon_c\\right)$, the boundary condition becomes:\n$$\nE_f \\left(\\frac{dw}{dx}\\bigg|_{x=\\pm L/2} + \\varepsilon_c\\right) = 0 \\implies \\frac{dw}{dx}\\bigg|_{x=\\pm L/2} = -\\varepsilon_c\n$$\nThe general solution to the ODE is $w(x) = C_1 \\cosh(\\beta x) + C_2 \\sinh(\\beta x)$. The derivative is $\\frac{dw}{dx} = C_1 \\beta \\sinh(\\beta x) + C_2 \\beta \\cosh(\\beta x)$.\nFrom physical symmetry, the response must be symmetric about $x=0$. Since $u_m(x)$ is an odd function, $u_f(x)$ must also be odd, making their difference $w(x)$ an odd function. This requires $C_1 = 0$.\nThe solution simplifies to $w(x) = C_2 \\sinh(\\beta x)$. Applying the boundary condition at $x=L/2$:\n$$\nC_2 \\beta \\cosh(\\beta L/2) = -\\varepsilon_c \\implies C_2 = -\\frac{\\varepsilon_c}{\\beta \\cosh(\\beta L/2)}\n$$\nThe particular solution for the relative displacement is thus:\n$$\nw(x) = -\\frac{\\varepsilon_c \\sinh(\\beta x)}{\\beta \\cosh(\\beta L/2)}\n$$\nWith $w(x)$ determined, we find the fiber stress profile:\n$$\n\\sigma_f(x) = E_f \\left(\\frac{dw}{dx} + \\varepsilon_c\\right) = E_f \\left(-\\frac{\\varepsilon_c \\cosh(\\beta x)}{\\cosh(\\beta L/2)} + \\varepsilon_c\\right) = E_f \\varepsilon_c \\left(1 - \\frac{\\cosh(\\beta x)}{\\cosh(\\beta L/2)}\\right)\n$$\nThe length efficiency factor, $\\eta_l$, is the ratio of the average fiber stress, $\\langle\\sigma_f\\rangle$, to the ideal iso-strain stress, $E_f \\varepsilon_c$. The average stress is:\n$$\n\\langle\\sigma_f\\rangle = \\frac{1}{L} \\int_{-L/2}^{L/2} \\sigma_f(x) dx = \\frac{E_f \\varepsilon_c}{L} \\int_{-L/2}^{L/2} \\left(1 - \\frac{\\cosh(\\beta x)}{\\cosh(\\beta L/2)}\\right) dx\n$$\n$$\n\\langle\\sigma_f\\rangle = \\frac{E_f \\varepsilon_c}{L} \\left[x - \\frac{\\sinh(\\beta x)}{\\beta \\cosh(\\beta L/2)}\\right]_{-L/2}^{L/2} = \\frac{E_f \\varepsilon_c}{L} \\left(L - \\frac{2 \\sinh(\\beta L/2)}{\\beta \\cosh(\\beta L/2)}\\right)\n$$\n$$\n\\langle\\sigma_f\\rangle = E_f \\varepsilon_c \\left(1 - \\frac{2}{L\\beta} \\tanh(\\beta L/2)\\right)\n$$\nTherefore, the length efficiency factor is:\n$$\n\\eta_l = \\frac{\\langle\\sigma_f\\rangle}{E_f \\varepsilon_c} = 1 - \\frac{\\tanh(\\beta L/2)}{\\beta L/2}\n$$\nThe effective axial modulus of the composite, $E_{\\text{eff}}$, is given by the modified rule of mixtures:\n$$\nE_{\\text{eff}} = V_f \\eta_l E_f + V_m E_m = V_f \\eta_l E_f + (1-V_f) E_m\n$$\nThe uncertainty propagation task requires us to treat the interfacial shear strength $\\tau_i$ as a random variable, $\\tau_i \\sim \\mathcal{N}(\\mu_{\\tau}, \\sigma_{\\tau}^2)$, truncated at zero. The parameter $\\beta$ depends on $\\tau_i$ through the interfacial stiffness $k_{\\text{int}} = \\tau_i / \\delta_c$:\n$$\n\\beta = \\sqrt{\\frac{2 k_{\\text{int}}}{r_f E_f}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{2 \\tau_i}{r_f E_f \\delta_c}}\n$$\nSince $\\tau_i$ is a random variable, so are $\\beta$, $\\eta_l$, and $E_{\\text{eff}}$. We will use a Monte Carlo simulation. For each of the $N=200,000$ samples of $\\tau_i$ drawn from its specified truncated normal distribution, we calculate the corresponding values of $\\eta_l$ and $E_{\\text{eff}}$. The sample mean and sample standard deviation of the resulting distributions for $\\eta_l$ and $E_{\\text{eff}}$ are then computed. A special case arises if $\\tau_i=0$, which implies $\\beta=0$; in this limit, $\\frac{\\tanh(z)}{z} \\to 1$ as $z \\to 0$, which correctly gives $\\eta_l=0$. This is handled in the numerical implementation.
