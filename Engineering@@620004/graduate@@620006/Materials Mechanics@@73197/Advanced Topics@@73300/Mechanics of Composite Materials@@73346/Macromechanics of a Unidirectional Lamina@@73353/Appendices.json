For a plane stress state in the laboratory coordinate system $\\{x, y\\}$, this is written in vector form as $U = \\frac{1}{2}\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}_{\\text{lab}}^T \\boldsymbol{\\epsilon}_{\\text{lab}}$, where $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}_{\\text{lab}} = (\\sigma_x, \\sigma_y, \\tau_{xy})^T$ and $\\boldsymbol{\\epsilon}_{\\text{lab}} = (\\epsilon_x, \\epsilon_y, \\gamma_{xy})^T$.\n\nThe constitutive relation is most simply expressed in the material's principal axes $\\{1, 2\\}$, where the $1$-axis is aligned with the fibers. In this system, the relationship between the stress vector $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}_{\\text{mat}} = (\\sigma_1, \\sigma_2, \\tau_{12})^T$ and the strain vector $\\boldsymbol{\\epsilon}_{\\text{mat}} = (\\epsilon_1, \\epsilon_2, \\gamma_{12})^T$ is $\\boldsymbol{\\epsilon}_{\\text{mat}} = \\mathbf{S} \\boldsymbol{\\sigma}_{\\text{mat}}$, where $\\mathbf{S}$ is the given compliance matrix.\n\nThe strain energy density is invariant under coordinate transformation, so it can also be calculated in the material system:\n$$U = \\frac{1}{2}\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}_{\\text{mat}}^T \\boldsymbol{\\epsilon}_{\\text{mat}} = \\frac{1}{2}\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}_{\\text{mat}}^T \\mathbf{S} \\boldsymbol{\\sigma}_{\\text{mat}}$$\nExpanding this expression, we get:\n$$U = \\frac{1}{2}(s_{11}\\sigma_1^2 + s_{22}\\sigma_2^2 + 2s_{12}\\sigma_1\\sigma_2 + s_{66}\\tau_{12}^2)$$\nTo express $U$ as a function of the orientation angle $\\theta$, we must relate the stress components in the material axes, $(\\sigma_1, \\sigma_2, \\tau_{12})$, to the given stress components in the laboratory axes, $(\\sigma_x, \\sigma_y, \\tau_{xy})$. The material axes are rotated by an angle $\\theta$ counterclockwise from the laboratory axes. The stress tensor transformation laws provide this relationship. In vector form, $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}_{\\text{mat}} = \\mathbf{T}_{\\sigma}(\\theta)\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}_{\\text{lab}}$, where $\\mathbf{T}_{\\sigma}(\\theta)$ is the stress transformation matrix. The components are:\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\n\\sigma_1 &= \\sigma_x \\cos^2\\theta + \\sigma_y \\sin^2\\theta + 2\\tau_{xy} \\sin\\theta \\cos\\theta \\\\\n\\sigma_2 &= \\sigma_x \\sin^2\\theta + \\sigma_y \\cos^2\\theta - 2\\tau_{xy} \\sin\\theta \\cos\\theta \\\\\n\\tau_{12} &= -(\\sigma_x - \\sigma_y)\\sin\\theta \\cos\\theta + \\tau_{xy}(\\cos^2\\theta - \\sin^2\\theta)\n\\end{align*}\nSubstituting these expressions for $\\sigma_1$, $\\sigma_2$, and $\\tau_{12}$ into the equation for $U$ provides the function $U(\\theta)$. The constrained optimization problem is then formulated as:\n$$\n\\min_{\\theta} U(\\theta) = \\frac{1}{2} \\left[ s_{11}\\sigma_1(\\theta)^2 + s_{22}\\sigma_2(\\theta)^2 + 2s_{12}\\sigma_1(\\theta)\\sigma_2(\\theta) + s_{66}\\tau_{12}(\\theta)^2 \\right] \\quad \\text{subject to} \\quad \\theta \\in [-\\pi/2, \\pi/2)\n$$\nwhere $\\sigma_1(\\theta)$, $\\sigma_2(\\theta)$, and $\\tau_{12}(\\theta)$ are the functions of $\\theta$ given by the transformation equations above. This completes the formulation as required.\n\n### Part 2: Analytical Solution\n\nTo simplify the analysis, we express the stress components in terms of the principal stresses of the applied stress state. Let $A = \\frac{\\sigma_x + \\sigma_y}{2}$ be the average stress and $R = \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{\\sigma_x - \\sigma_y}{2}\\right)^2 + \\tau_{xy}^2}$ be the radius of Mohr's circle for stress. The principal stresses are $\\sigma_{p1} = A+R$ and $\\sigma_{p2} = A-R$. The orientation of the first principal axis from the $x$-axis is given by an angle $\\phi$, where $\\tan(2\\phi) = \\frac{2\\tau_{xy}}{\\sigma_x-\\sigma_y}$.\n\nUsing trigonometric identities ($ \\cos^2\\theta = \\frac{1+\\cos(2\\theta)}{2} $, $ \\sin^2\\theta = \\frac{1-\\cos(2\\theta)}{2} $, $ \\sin\\theta\\cos\\theta = \\frac{\\sin(2\\theta)}{2} $), the stress components in the material axes can be written as:\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\n\\sigma_1 &= A + \\frac{\\sigma_x - \\sigma_y}{2}\\cos(2\\theta) + \\tau_{xy}\\sin(2\\theta) = A + R\\cos(2\\theta-2\\phi) \\\\\n\\sigma_2 &= A - \\frac{\\sigma_x - \\sigma_y}{2}\\cos(2\\theta) - \\tau_{xy}\\sin(2\\theta) = A - R\\cos(2\\theta-2\\phi) \\\\\n\\tau_{12} &= -\\frac{\\sigma_x - \\sigma_y}{2}\\sin(2\\theta) + \\tau_{xy}\\cos(2\\theta) = -R\\sin(2\\theta-2\\phi)\n\\end{align*}\nLet $\\alpha = \\theta - \\phi$ be the angle between the fiber direction ($1$-axis) and the principal stress direction $\\sigma_{p1}$. Then the stress components become:\n$$ \\sigma_1 = A + R\\cos(2\\alpha), \\quad \\sigma_2 = A - R\\cos(2\\alpha), \\quad \\tau_{12} = -R\\sin(2\\alpha) $$\nSubstituting these into the strain energy density expression:\n$$\nU(\\alpha) = \\frac{1}{2} \\left[ s_{11}(A+R\\cos(2\\alpha))^2 + s_{22}(A-R\\cos(2\\alpha))^2 + 2s_{12}(A^2-R^2\\cos^2(2\\alpha)) + s_{66}(-R\\sin(2\\alpha))^2 \\right]\n$$\nExpanding and collecting terms:\n$$\nU(\\alpha) = \\frac{1}{2} \\left[ (s_{11}+s_{22}+2s_{12})A^2 + 2(s_{11}-s_{22})AR\\cos(2\\alpha) + (s_{11}+s_{22}-2s_{12})R^2\\cos^2(2\\alpha) + s_{66}R^2\\sin^2(2\\alpha) \\right]\n$$\nUsing $\\sin^2(2\\alpha) = 1-\\cos^2(2\\alpha)$, we simplify the expression to a quadratic function of $z = \\cos(2\\alpha)$:\n$$\nU(z) = \\frac{1}{2} \\left[ (s_{11}+s_{22}-2s_{12}-s_{66})R^2 z^2 + 2(s_{11}-s_{22})AR z + (s_{11}+s_{22}+2s_{12})A^2 + s_{66}R^2 \\right]\n$$\nThis is of the form $U(z) = K_2 z^2 + K_1 z + K_0$, where $z \\in [-1, 1]$.\nThe coefficients are:\n$$\nK_2 = \\frac{R^2}{2}(s_{11}+s_{22}-2s_{12}-s_{66}), \\quad K_1 = AR(s_{11}-s_{22}), \\quad K_0 = \\frac{1}{2}((s_{11}+s_{22}+2s_{12})A^2 + s_{66}R^2)\n$$\nTo find the minimum, we analyze this quadratic function. The vertex of the parabola is at $z_v = -\\frac{K_1}{2K_2}$.\nThe nature of the extremum depends on the sign of $K_2$. The term $s_{11}+s_{22}-2s_{12}-s_{66} = \\frac{1}{E_1}+\\frac{1}{E_2}+\\frac{2\\nu_{12}}{E_1}-\\frac{1}{G_{12}}$ is typically negative for high-performance composites, which makes $K_2 < 0$. If $K_2 < 0$, the parabola opens downwards, so its vertex is a maximum. The minimum value of $U(z)$ over the interval $z \\in [-1, 1]$ must occur at one of the boundaries, $z=1$ or $z=-1$.\n- $z=1$ corresponds to $\\cos(2\\alpha)=1 \\implies \\alpha=0, \\pm\\pi, ...$\n- $z=-1$ corresponds to $\\cos(2\\alpha)=-1 \\implies \\alpha=\\pm\\pi/2, \\pm3\\pi/2, ...$\nWe compare the energy at these two points: $U(z=1)$ versus $U(z=-1)$.\n$$ U(1) - U(-1) = (K_2+K_1+K_0) - (K_2-K_1+K_0) = 2K_1 = 2AR(s_{11}-s_{22}) $$\nThe optimal orientation is determined by the sign of $K_1$:\n1. If $K_1 > 0$, then $U(1) > U(-1)$, so the minimum is at $z=-1$, which implies $\\alpha=\\pm\\pi/2$. The fibers should be perpendicular to the principal tensile stress axis.\n2. If $K_1 < 0$, then $U(1) < U(-1)$, so the minimum is at $z=1$, which implies $\\alpha=0$. The fibers should be aligned with the principal tensile stress axis.\n\nFor a typical unidirectional composite, fibers are much stiffer than the matrix, so $E_1 \\gg E_2$, which implies $s_{11} = 1/E_1 \\ll 1/E_2 = s_{22}$, making $s_{11}-s_{22} < 0$. In this case, the sign of $K_1$ is opposite to the sign of the average stress $A$. If the average stress is positive (tensile), $A>0$, then $K_1 < 0$ and the minimum energy is achieved when $\\alpha=0$.\n\n### Part 3: Numerical Computation\n\nGiven material properties and stress state:\n$E_1 = 140\\,\\mathrm{GPa}$, $E_2 = 9\\,\\mathrm{GPa}$, $G_{12} = 5\\,\\mathrm{GPa}$, $\\nu_{12} = 0.28$.\n$\\sigma_x = 85\\,\\mathrm{MPa}$, $\\sigma_y = -30\\,\\mathrm{MPa}$, $\\tau_{xy} = 60\\,\\mathrm{MPa}$.\n\nFirst, we compute the compliance components in units of $\\mathrm{GPa}^{-1}$:\n$s_{11} = \\frac{1}{140} \\approx 0.007143\\,\\mathrm{GPa}^{-1}$\n$s_{22} = \\frac{1}{9} \\approx 0.111111\\,\\mathrm{GPa}^{-1}$\n$s_{12} = -\\frac{0.28}{140} = -0.002\\,\\mathrm{GPa}^{-1}$\n$s_{66} = \\frac{1}{5} = 0.2\\,\\mathrm{GPa}^{-1}$\n\nNext, we compute the stress invariants and principal axis orientation:\n$A = \\frac{85 + (-30)}{2} = 27.5\\,\\mathrm{MPa}$\n$\\frac{\\sigma_x - \\sigma_y}{2} = \\frac{85 - (-30)}{2} = 57.5\\,\\mathrm{MPa}$\n$R = \\sqrt{57.5^2 + 60^2} = \\sqrt{3306.25 + 3600} = \\sqrt{6906.25} = 83.10385\\,\\mathrm{MPa}$\n\nNow, we determine the case for optimization by checking the signs of $K_2$ and $K_1$:\nFor $K_2$:\n$s_{11}+s_{22}-2s_{12}-s_{66} = \\frac{1}{140} + \\frac{1}{9} - 2(-0.002) - \\frac{1}{5} \\approx 0.00714 + 0.11111 + 0.004 - 0.2 = -0.07775\\,\\mathrm{GPa}^{-1}$.\nSince this term is negative, $K_2 < 0$. As analyzed, the minimum must be at $\\alpha=0$ or $\\alpha=\\pi/2$.\n\nFor $K_1$:\nThe sign of $K_1$ depends on $A(s_{11}-s_{22})$.\n$A = 27.5\\,\\mathrm{MPa} > 0$.\n$s_{11}-s_{22} = \\frac{1}{140} - \\frac{1}{9} = \\frac{9-140}{1260} = -\\frac{131}{1260} < 0$.\nTherefore, $K_1 = AR(s_{11}-s_{22}) < 0$.\n\nSince $K_1 < 0$, we have $U(z=1) < U(z=-1)$. The minimum occurs at $z=1$, which corresponds to $\\cos(2\\alpha) = 1$, so the optimal angle is $\\alpha=0$.\nThis means the optimal fiber orientation $\\theta^{\\star}$ must be equal to the principal stress angle $\\phi$. Physically, the stiff fibers should be aligned with the direction of the maximum principal tensile stress.\n\nWe calculate $\\phi$:\n$\\tan(2\\phi) = \\frac{2\\tau_{xy}}{\\sigma_x-\\sigma_y} = \\frac{2 \\times 60}{85 - (-30)} = \\frac{120}{115} = \\frac{24}{23}$\n$2\\phi = \\arctan(\\frac{24}{23}) \\approx 46.2253^{\\circ}$\n$\\phi = \\frac{1}{2}\\arctan(\\frac{24}{23}) \\approx 23.11265^{\\circ}$\n\nThe optimal fiber orientation is $\\theta^{\\star} = \\phi$. Rounding to four significant figures gives:\n$\\theta^{\\star} = 23.11^{\\circ}$\nThis value is in the specified interval $[-90^{\\circ}, 90^{\\circ})$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{23.11}$$", "id": "2899271"}]}
