I will proceed with the derivation and calculation.\n\nThe objective is to derive an explicit closed-form expression for the transverse Young's modulus of a unidirectional fiber composite, $E_{2c}$, based on a set of rational constraints. This procedure leads to the Halpin-Tsai relations.\n\nFirst, we postulate a rational approximation for the effective modulus $E_{2c}$ as a function of the fiber volume fraction $V_f$. A general form that satisfies the normalization condition $E_{2c} \\to E_m$ as $V_f \\to 0$ is the Halpin-Tsai equation:\n$$ \\frac{E_{2c}}{E_m} = \\frac{1 + \\xi \\eta V_f}{1 - \\eta V_f} $$\nHere, $\\xi$ is a dimensionless parameter that reflects the fiber geometry and packing arrangement, and $\\eta$ is a dimensionless measure of the contrast in moduli between the fiber and matrix phases.\n\nThe problem specifies several constraints on the parameter $\\eta$, which is a function of the modulus ratio $r \\equiv E_f/E_m$ and the geometric parameter $\\xi$. These constraints are:\n1.  $\\eta(r, \\xi)$ is dimensionless. This is satisfied if it is a function of the dimensionless quantities $r$ and $\\xi$.\n2.  $\\eta$ is a monotonically increasing function of $r$.\n3.  $\\eta = 0$ when $r=1$. This correctly ensures that if the fiber and matrix have identical properties ($E_f = E_m$), the composite is homogeneous and $E_{2c} = E_m$.\n4.  $\\eta \\to 1$ as $r \\to \\infty$. This represents the case of rigid fibers compared to the matrix.\n\nWe seek the simplest functional form for $\\eta$ that satisfies these conditions. A rational function of $r$ is a logical choice. To satisfy constraint 3, the numerator must contain a term $(r-1)$. To satisfy constraint 4, the function must approach $1$ as $r \\to \\infty$, which implies the numerator and denominator should have the same degree in $r$ and the same leading coefficient. This leads to the form:\n$$ \\eta = \\frac{r-1}{r+k} $$\nwhere $k$ is a parameter that may depend on $\\xi$.\n\nTo check constraint 2, we compute the derivative of $\\eta$ with respect to $r$:\n$$ \\frac{d\\eta}{dr} = \\frac{d}{dr}\\left(\\frac{r-1}{r+k}\\right) = \\frac{(1)(r+k) - (r-1)(1)}{(r+k)^2} = \\frac{k+1}{(r+k)^2} $$\nFor $\\eta$ to be monotonic in $r$, we must have $\\frac{d\\eta}{dr} > 0$. Since $(r+k)^2 \\ge 0$ and $r = E_f/E_m > 0$, this requires $k+1 > 0$, or $k > -1$.\n\nThe parameter $k$ is related to the geometric parameter $\\xi$. In the development of the Halpin-Tsai model, the simplest assumption consistent with its semi-empirical nature is a direct identity: $k = \\xi$. Since $\\xi$ represents a physical reinforcement geometry, it is positive, so $\\xi>0$, which automatically satisfies the condition $k > -1$.\n\nThus, we have derived the form of $\\eta$:\n$$ \\eta = \\frac{r-1}{r+\\xi} = \\frac{E_f/E_m - 1}{E_f/E_m + \\xi} $$\n\nCombining the expressions, the explicit closed-form expression for $E_{2c}$ is:\n$$ E_{2c} = E_m \\left( \\frac{1 + \\xi \\eta V_f}{1 - \\eta V_f} \\right) \\quad \\text{with} \\quad \\eta = \\frac{E_f/E_m - 1}{E_f/E_m + \\xi} $$\n\nThe problem statement requires that this model recovers the \"correct dilute-inclusion trend\" for circular fibers, for which we are to adopt the standard value $\\xi=2$. This is not a condition from which we derive $\\xi=2$, but rather the justification for using $\\xi=2$ within this semi-empirical framework.
