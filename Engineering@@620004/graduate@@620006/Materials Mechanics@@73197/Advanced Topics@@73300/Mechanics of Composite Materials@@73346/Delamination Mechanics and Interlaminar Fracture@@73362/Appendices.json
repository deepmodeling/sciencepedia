The arms are slender and obey Euler–Bernoulli kinematics (negligible shear deformation), and the material response is linear elastic. The crack length along the mid-plane is $a$. The DCB is loaded quasi-statically in opening by a force $P$ applied at the load points, producing a load-point opening displacement $\\delta$. The global linear compliance is defined as $C(a) = \\delta/P$.\n\nBecause of near-crack-root effects (rotation and constraint at the crack tip), the compliance does not follow a pure cubic dependence on $a$, but compliance calibration reveals that $C(a)^{1/3}$ is linear in $a$. Denoting by $\\Delta$ the positive crack-length correction obtained from the intercept of this linear calibration, one may represent the compliance as $C(a) = m\\,(a+\\Delta)^{3}$, where $m$ is a geometry and modulus dependent constant.\n\nStarting only from first principles of energy balance (conservation of energy applied to elastic systems), the definition of compliance, and Euler–Bernoulli beam scaling that gives a cubic dependence of deflection on span, derive a closed-form expression for the Mode I energy release rate $G_{I}$ in terms of $P$, $\\delta$, $b$, $a$, and $\\Delta$ under load-controlled conditions.

This energy is equal to the work, $\\Delta W_{\\text{closure}}$, needed to close the crack faces over this new area.\n\nWithin a finite element framework using coincident nodes at the crack front, the VCCT provides a computationally efficient means to estimate this work. Let the crack tip be at a node $i$. For the crack to advance to the next node, $i+1$, the constraint holding node $i$ closed must be released.

The derived expressions remain valid for this standard implementation.\n\nNext, for Task 2, we compute $G_I$ and $G_{II}$ for each mesh, using the provided data and $b=1$ m.\n\nFor the coarse mesh ($h_c = \\Delta a_c = 1.0 \\times 10^{-3}$ m):\n$G_{I,c} = \\frac{(620 \\text{ N})(6.0 \\times 10^{-4} \\text{ m})}{2 (1 \\text{ m})(1.0 \\times 10^{-3} \\text{ m})} = \\frac{0.372}{0.002} = 186 \\text{ J/m}^2$\n$G_{II,c} = \\frac{(630 \\text{ N})(4.0 \\times 10^{-4} \\text{ m})}{2 (1 \\text{ m})(1.0 \\times 10^{-3} \\text{ m})} = \\frac{0.252}{0.002} = 126 \\text{ J/m}^2$\nThe total energy release rate is $G_c = G_{I,c} + G_{II,c} = 186 + 126 = 312 \\text{ J/m}^2$.\n\nFor the medium mesh ($h_m = \\Delta a_m = 5.0 \\times 10^{-4}$ m):\n$G_{I,m} = \\frac{(610 \\text{ N})(3.0 \\times 10^{-4} \\text{ m})}{2 (1 \\text{ m})(5.0 \\times 10^{-4} \\text{ m})} = \\frac{0.183}{0.001} = 183 \\text{ J/m}^2$\n$G_{II,m} = \\frac{(615 \\text{ N})(2.0 \\times 10^{-4} \\text{ m})}{2 (1 \\text{ m})(5.0 \\times 10^{-4} \\text{ m})} = \\frac{0.123}{0.001} = 123 \\text{ J/m}^2$\nThe total energy release rate is $G_m = G_{I,m} + G_{II,m} = 183 + 123 = 306 \\text{ J/m}^2$.\n\nFor the fine mesh ($h_f = \\Delta a_f = 2.5 \\times 10^{-4}$ m):\n$G_{I,f} = \\frac{(605 \\text{ N})(1.5 \\times 10^{-4} \\text{ m})}{2 (1 \\text{ m})(2.5 \\times 10^{-4} \\text{ m})} = \\frac{0.09075}{0.0005} = 181.5 \\text{ J/m}^2$\n$G_{II,f} = \\frac{(607.5 \\text{ N})(1.0 \\times 10^{-4} \\text{ m})}{2 (1 \\text{ m})(2.5 \\times 10^{-4} \\text{ m})} = \\frac{0.06075}{0.0005} = 121.5 \\text{ J/m}^2$\nThe total energy release rate is $G_f = G_{I,f} + G_{II,f} = 181.5 + 121.5 = 303 \\text{ J/m}^2$.\n\nFor Task 3, we estimate the order of convergence $p$ using the asymptotic error model $G^{(h)} = G^{(\\infty)} + C h^{p}$.\nLet the three mesh sizes be $h_1 = h_c$, $h_2 = h_m$, and $h_3 = h_f$. The corresponding total energy release rates are $G_1 = G_c$, $G_2 = G_m$, and $G_3 = G_f$. The mesh refinement is uniform with a ratio $r = \\frac{h_1}{h_2} = \\frac{h_2}{h_3} = \\frac{1.0 \\times 10^{-3}}{5.0 \\times 10^{-4}} = 2$.\nWe have the system of equations:\n$G_1 = G^{(\\infty)} + C h_1^p$\n$G_2 = G^{(\\infty)} + C h_2^p = G^{(\\infty)} + C (h_1/r)^p$\n$G_3 = G^{(\\infty)} + C h_3^p = G^{(\\infty)} + C (h_2/r)^p$\nSubtracting consecutive equations gives:\n$G_1 - G_2 = C (h_1^p - h_2^p) = C h_2^p (r^p - 1)$\n$G_2 - G_3 = C (h_2^p - h_3^p) = C h_3^p (r^p - 1)$\nThe ratio of these differences eliminates the constant $C$:\n$$ \\frac{G_1 - G_2}{G_2 - G_3} = \\frac{C h_2^p (r^p - 1)}{C h_3^p (r^p - 1)} = \\left(\\frac{h_2}{h_3}\\right)^p = r^p $$\nSubstituting the computed values for $G$:\n$G_1 - G_2 = 312 - 306 = 6$\n$G_2 - G_3 = 306 - 303 = 3$\nThe ratio is $\\frac{6}{3} = 2$.\nTherefore, $r^p = 2$. Since $r=2$, we have $2^p = 2$, which yields an estimated order of convergence $p = 1$.\n\nFinally, for Task 4, we apply Richardson extrapolation to estimate the converged total energy release rate $G^{(\\infty)}$ as $h \\to 0$. We use the results from the two finest meshes ($h_m, G_m$ and $h_f, G_f$) and the estimated order $p=1$.\nThe two equations are:\n$G_m = G^{(\\infty)} + C h_m^p$\n$G_f = G^{(\\infty)} + C h_f^p = G^{(\\infty)} + C (h_m/r)^p$\nTo eliminate $C$, we multiply the second equation by $r^p$ and subtract the first equation:\n$G_f r^p - G_m = (G^{(\\infty)} r^p + C h_m^p) - (G^{(\\infty)} + C h_m^p) = G^{(\\infty)}(r^p - 1)$\nSolving for $G^{(\\infty)}$ gives the extrapolation formula:\n$$ G^{(\\infty)} = \\frac{G_f r^p - G_m}{r^p - 1} $$\nSubstituting $G_m = 306 \\text{ J/m}^2$, $G_f = 303 \\text{ J/m}^2$, $r=2$, and $p=1$:\n$$ G^{(\\infty)} = \\frac{(303)(2^1) - 306}{2^1 - 1} = \\frac{606 - 306}{1} = 300 \\text{ J/m}^2 $$\nThe question requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures. Thus, $300$ must be written as $300.0$.\nThe extrapolated total interlaminar energy release rate is $G^{(\\infty)} = 300.0 \\text{ J/m}^2$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{300.0}$$", "id": "2877274"}]}
