The classical theory developed by Heinrich Hertz provides a powerful framework for modeling this interaction by treating it as the contact between smooth, curved bodies. This practice will guide you through deriving the foundational Hertzian relationships that link applied load, contact size, and elastic deformation, and then challenges you to assess the validity of the underlying linear elasticity assumption—a critical skill for applying theoretical models to real-world scenarios [@problem_id:2915129].", "problem": "A single smooth asperity on a nominally rough surface is modeled as a rigid sphere of radius $R$ indenting an elastic isotropic half-space with effective (or composite) modulus $E^*$ under a normal force $P$. The contact is frictionless and non-adhesive, and small-strain, small-slope kinematics apply. You may treat the local summit geometry of the asperity as parabolic. The material’s yield strength is $\\sigma_y$. In multi-asperity theories of rough surface contact, this single-asperity contact constitutes the fundamental local contact element.\n\nStarting from fundamental principles of linear elasticity for axisymmetric normal contact of a smooth indenter on a half-space, namely: (i) geometric compatibility of surface profiles within the contact (gap closure equals the elastic approach), (ii) equilibrium between the applied load and the distributed contact pressure, and (iii) the standard Boussinesq solution for surface displacements under normal tractions on a half-space, derive the relations linking the contact radius $a$, approach (indentation) $\\delta$, and maximum contact pressure $p_0$ to $R$, $E^*$, and $P$.

First, the problem is validated and found to be well-posed, scientifically sound, and internally consistent. We shall now proceed with its solution. The solution is structured into three parts: first, the derivation of the governing equations from fundamental principles; second, the numerical evaluation of the contact parameters; and third, a critical assessment of the linear elasticity assumption.\n\nThe problem models an asperity as a rigid sphere of radius $R$ indenting an elastic half-space, with the combined elastic properties of the system captured by an effective modulus $E^*$. The contact is subject to a normal force $P$. We are to derive the relationships for the contact radius $a$, the indentation depth (approach) $\\delta$, and the maximum contact pressure $p_0$.\n\nThe derivation proceeds from three fundamental principles as stipulated.\n\n1.  **Geometric Compatibility**:\n    Let a coordinate system be established with its origin at the initial point of contact and the $z$-axis directed into the elastic half-space. The undeformed profile of the spherical indenter, using the allowed parabolic approximation for small slopes, is given by $z_s(r) = r^2/(2R)$, where $r$ is the radial coordinate. When an indentation of depth $\\delta$ occurs, the surface of the half-space deforms by an amount $w(r)$. For the two bodies to remain in contact within a circular region of radius $a$, the following geometric condition must be met for $r \\le a$:\n    $$w(r) + z_s(r) = \\delta$$\n    Substituting the parabolic profile gives the required shape of the deformed surface under the indenter:\n    $$w(r) = \\delta - \\frac{r^2}{2R}$$\n\n2.  **Pressure-Displacement Relationship (Boussinesq Solution)**:\n    Hertz postulated a semi-ellipsoidal (or hemispherical in 3D) pressure distribution, which has been proven to be correct for this geometry. The pressure $p(r)$ is given by:\n    $$p(r) = p_0 \\sqrt{1 - \\left(\\frac{r}{a}\\right)^2} \\quad \\text{for } r \\le a$$\n    where $p_0$ is the maximum pressure at the center of contact ($r=0$).\n    The surface displacement $w(r)$ resulting from such a pressure distribution on an elastic half-space is a standard result derived from the Boussinesq potential solution. For the composite displacement of two bodies characterized by $E^*$, this displacement within the contact area ($r \\le a$) is:\n    $$w(r) = \\frac{\\pi p_0}{4aE^*}(2a^2 - r^2)$$\n    By equating the two expressions for $w(r)$, we enforce compatibility between the geometry and the elastic response:\n    $$\\delta - \\frac{r^2}{2R} = \\frac{\\pi p_0 a}{2E^*} - \\frac{\\pi p_0 r^2}{4aE^*}$$\n    For this identity to hold for all $r \\in [0, a]$, the coefficients of the constant terms and the $r^2$ terms on both sides must be equal.\n    Matching the coefficients of $r^2$:\n    $$\\frac{1}{2R} = \\frac{\\pi p_0}{4aE^*} \\implies p_0 = \\frac{2aE^*}{\\pi R}$$\n    Matching the constant terms:\n    $$\\delta = \\frac{\\pi p_0 a}{2E^*}$$\n    Substituting the expression for $p_0$ into the expression for $\\delta$, we obtain a purely geometric relationship between indentation and contact radius:\n    $$\\delta = \\frac{\\pi a}{2E^*} \\left( \\frac{2aE^*}{\\pi R} \\right) = \\frac{a^2}{R}$$\n\n3.  **Equilibrium**:\n    The total applied normal force $P$ must be balanced by the integral of the pressure distribution over the contact area:\n    $$P = \\int_0^a p(r) \\cdot 2\\pi r \\, dr = \\int_0^a p_0 \\sqrt{1 - \\left(\\frac{r}{a}\\right)^2} \\cdot 2\\pi r \\, dr$$\n    Performing the integration, for instance by substituting $u = 1 - (r/a)^2$, yields:\n    $$P = \\frac{2}{3} \\pi p_0 a^2$$\n\nFrom these three derived relationships, we can express $a$, $\\delta$, and $p_0$ in terms of the given parameters $P$, $R$, and $E^*$.\nFirst, substitute $p_0 = 2aE^*/(\\pi R)$ into the force equilibrium equation:\n$$P = \\frac{2}{3}\\pi a^2 \\left(\\frac{2aE^*}{\\pi R}\\right) = \\frac{4a^3 E^*}{3R}$$\nFrom this, we solve for the contact radius $a$:\n$$a = \\left( \\frac{3PR}{4E^*} \\right)^{1/3}$$\nNow, we can find the indentation $\\delta$ and maximum pressure $p_0$:\n$$\\delta = \\frac{a^2}{R} = \\frac{1}{R} \\left( \\frac{3PR}{4E^*} \\right)^{2/3} = \\left( \\frac{9P^2}{16RE^{*2}} \\right)^{1/3}$$\n$$p_0 = \\frac{2aE^*}{\\pi R} = \\frac{2E^*}{\\pi R} \\left( \\frac{3PR}{4E^*} \\right)^{1/3} = \\left( \\frac{6P(E^*)^2}{\\pi^3 R^2} \\right)^{1/3}$$\n\nNow, we perform the numerical calculations using the provided values:\n$R = 10\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m} = 1 \\times 10^{-5}\\,\\mathrm{m}$\n$E^* = 100\\,\\mathrm{GPa} = 1 \\times 10^{11}\\,\\mathrm{Pa}$\n$P = 10\\,\\mathrm{mN} = 1 \\times 10^{-2}\\,\\mathrm{N}$\n$\\sigma_y = 1.0\\,\\mathrm{GPa} = 1 \\times 10^9\\,\\mathrm{Pa}$\n\nContact radius $a$:\n$$a = \\left( \\frac{3(1 \\times 10^{-2}\\,\\mathrm{N})(1 \\times 10^{-5}\\,\\mathrm{m})}{4(1 \\times 10^{11}\\,\\mathrm{Pa})} \\right)^{1/3} = \\left( \\frac{3 \\times 10^{-7}}{4 \\times 10^{11}} \\right)^{1/3} = (0.75 \\times 10^{-18})^{1/3}\\,\\mathrm{m}$$\n$$a \\approx 0.90856 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{m} = 0.90856\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}$$\nTo three significant figures, $a = 0.909\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}$.\n\nIndentation depth $\\delta$:\n$$\\delta = \\frac{a^2}{R} = \\frac{(0.90856 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{m})^2}{1 \\times 10^{-5}\\,\\mathrm{m}} \\approx 8.2548 \\times 10^{-8}\\,\\mathrm{m} = 82.548\\,\\mathrm{nm}$$\nTo three significant figures, $\\delta = 82.5\\,\\mathrm{nm}$.\n\nMaximum pressure $p_0$:\n$$p_0 = \\frac{3P}{2\\pi a^2} = \\frac{3(1 \\times 10^{-2}\\,\\mathrm{N})}{2\\pi(0.90856 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{m})^2} \\approx 5.784 \\times 10^9\\,\\mathrm{Pa} = 5.784\\,\\mathrm{GPa}$$\nTo three significant figures, $p_0 = 5.78\\,\\mathrm{GPa}$.\n\nFinally, we assess the validity of the linear elastic assumption. Plastic yielding is predicted to initiate when the maximum von Mises equivalent stress, $\\sigma_{\\text{vM,max}}$, reaches the material's yield strength, $\\sigma_y$. For a Hertzian point contact, yielding begins subsurface. The maximum von Mises stress is proportional to the maximum contact pressure $p_0$. The exact relationship depends on the Poisson's ratio, $\\nu$, of the elastic material, which is not provided. We make the standard idealization of assuming $\\nu=0.3$, a typical value for metals. For this value, the maximum von Mises stress is located at a depth of approximately $z \\approx 0.48a$ and is given by:\n$$\\sigma_{\\text{vM,max}} \\approx 0.6 \\, p_0$$\nUsing our calculated value for $p_0$:\n$$\\sigma_{\\text{vM,max}} \\approx 0.6 \\times 5.78\\,\\mathrm{GPa} \\approx 3.47\\,\\mathrm{GPa}$$\nWe must compare this value to the material's yield strength, $\\sigma_y = 1.0\\,\\mathrm{GPa}$.\nSince $\\sigma_{\\text{vM,max}} \\approx 3.47\\,\\mathrm{GPa}$ is significantly greater than $\\sigma_y = 1.0\\,\\mathrm{GPa}$, substantial plastic deformation is expected to occur. Therefore, the assumption of purely linear elastic behavior is not reasonable under these loading conditions. The contact is in the elastic-plastic regime.\nThis leads to the conclusion that the indicator $I$, which is $1$ if the assumption is reasonable and $0$ otherwise, must be $0$.\n\nThe final results, rounded to three significant figures, are:\n-   $a = 0.909\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}$\n-   $\\delta = 82.5\\,\\mathrm{nm}$\n-   $p_0 = 5.78\\,\\mathrm{GPa}$\n-   $I = 0$", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{ \\begin{pmatrix} 0.909 & 82.5 & 5.78 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} } $$", "id": "2915129"}, {"introduction": "Moving from a single point of contact to an entire interface requires a statistical description of the surface geometry.

We can write this relationship as:\n$$\n\\langle p \\rangle_c = C E^* m_{\\mathrm{rms}}\n$$\nwhere $C$ is a dimensionless constant of order unity. The exact value of $C$ depends on the specific theoretical model and statistical assumptions (e.g., $C \\approx \\sqrt{\\pi/2}$ in some models), but its precise value is not required for the forthcoming analysis.\n\nSubstituting this into the expression for the area fraction gives:\n$$\n\\frac{A_r}{A_0} = \\frac{p_0}{C E^* m_{\\mathrm{rms}}}\n$$\nThis expression is consistent with the problem's stated assumption that the area fraction is proportional to the load (i.e., to $p_0$).\n\nFirst, we estimate the area fraction to check for self-consistency with the small-load assumption. Using the provided values $p_0 = 10\\,\\mathrm{MPa} = 10^7\\,\\mathrm{Pa}$, $E^* = 100\\,\\mathrm{GPa} = 10^{11}\\,\\mathrm{Pa}$, and $m_{\\mathrm{rms}} = 0.1$, we find:\n$$\n\\frac{A_r}{A_0} = \\frac{10^7\\,\\mathrm{Pa}}{C \\cdot (10^{11}\\,\\mathrm{Pa}) \\cdot 0.1} = \\frac{10^7}{C \\cdot 10^{10}} = \\frac{1}{1000 \\cdot C}\n$$\nAssuming $C$ is of order $1$, the area fraction is of the order of $10^{-3}$, which is indeed small and justifies the use of a linear theory.\n\nThe main task is to compute the sensitivity factor $S$. Let the initial state (with cutoff $q_s$) and the final state (with cutoff $2q_s$) be denoted without and with a prime, respectively. The area fractions are:\n$$\n\\left(\\frac{A_r}{A_0}\\right)\\bigg|_{q_s} = \\frac{p_0}{C E^* m_{\\mathrm{rms}}(q_s)}\n$$\n$$\n\\left(\\frac{A_r}{A_0}\\right)\\bigg|_{2q_s} = \\frac{p_0}{C E^* m_{\\mathrm{rms}}(2q_s)}\n$$\nHere, we have explicitly written the dependence of the rms gradient on the cutoff wavenumber $q_s$. The parameters $p_0$, $E^*$, and the constant $C$ are unchanged. The sensitivity factor $S$ is the ratio of these two quantities:\n$$\nS = \\frac{(A_r/A_0)|_{2q_s}}{(A_r/A_0)|_{q_s}} = \\frac{p_0 / (C E^* m_{\\mathrm{rms}}(2q_s))}{p_0 / (C E^* m_{\\mathrm{rms}}(q_s))} = \\frac{m_{\\mathrm{rms}}(q_s)}{m_{\\mathrm{rms}}(2q_s)}\n$$\nWe are given the scaling law for the rms gradient for a self-affine surface: $m_{\\mathrm{rms}} \\propto q_s^{1-H}$. Let us write this with a proportionality constant $K$: $m_{\\mathrm{rms}}(q_s) = K q_s^{1-H}$. Then we have:\n$$\nm_{\\mathrm{rms}}(2q_s) = K (2q_s)^{1-H} = K \\cdot 2^{1-H} \\cdot q_s^{1-H} = 2^{1-H} m_{\\mathrm{rms}}(q_s)\n$$\nSubstituting this into the expression for $S$:\n$$\nS = \\frac{m_{\\mathrm{rms}}(q_s)}{2^{1-H} m_{\\mathrm{rms}}(q_s)} = \\frac{1}{2^{1-H}} = 2^{-(1-H)} = 2^{H-1}\n$$\nThis is the general symbolic result for the sensitivity factor. It correctly shows that the sensitivity depends only on the Hurst exponent $H$, which governs the scaling of the surface roughness, and not on the absolute values of pressure, modulus, or rms gradient.\n\nNow, we substitute the given numerical value for the Hurst exponent, $H = 0.8$:\n$$\nS = 2^{0.8 - 1} = 2^{-0.2}\n$$\nTo obtain the numerical value, we compute:\n$$\nS = 2^{-1/5} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt[5]{2}} \\approx 0.87055056...\n$$\nRounding to $4$ significant figures as requested, we obtain $S \\approx 0.8706$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.8706}$$", "id": "2915153"}]}
