It is a standard, albeit simplified, exercise in engineering heat transfer.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid and a solution will be provided.\n\n### Derivation of the Melt Pool Depth Expression\nWe follow the problem's instructions to establish an energy balance. The problem prescribes considering a residence time $\\tau \\approx 2 r_b / v$, which corresponds to the time the beam takes to travel a distance equal to its diameter. This suggests analyzing the energy balance over a control volume of material that interacts with the beam during this time. We approximate the laser spot as a square of side length $2 r_b$. The control volume is thus a cuboid of dimensions $2 r_b \\times 2 r_b \\times h$.\n\nThe energy balance for this control volume is:\n$$E_{in} = E_{melt} + E_{cond}$$\nwhere $E_{in}$ is the absorbed laser energy, $E_{melt}$ is the energy required to heat and melt the control volume, and $E_{cond}$ is the energy lost to conduction.\n\n1.  **Absorbed Energy ($E_{in}$):** The laser power is $P$ and the absorptivity is $A$. The absorbed power is $A P$. The energy delivered during the residence time $\\tau = 2 r_b / v$ is:\n    $$E_{in} = (A P) \\tau = \\frac{2 A P r_b}{v}$$\n\n2.  **Energy for Melting ($E_{melt}$):** The volume of the control element is $V = (2 r_b) \\cdot (2 r_b) \\cdot h = 4 r_b^2 h$. The mass is $m = \\rho V = 4 \\rho r_b^2 h$. The problem defines the specific enthalpy required for heating from $T_0$ to $T_m$ and melting as $H_f = c_p (T_m - T_0) + L$. Thus, the energy is:\n    $$E_{melt} = m H_f = 4 \\rho r_b^2 h H_f$$\n\n3.  **Energy Lost to Conduction ($E_{cond}$):** The problem provides a specific recipe for this term. The heat flux is $q'' \\approx k (T_m - T_0)/h = k \\Delta T / h$. This flux acts for the residence time $\\tau = 2 r_b / v$. The problem states it acts \"over the width $2 r_b$,\" which in the context of our 3D control volume implies loss through the bottom surface area $A_{bottom} = (2 r_b)^2 = 4 r_b^2$. The conduction power is $Q_{cond} = q'' A_{bottom} = (k \\Delta T / h) (4 r_b^2)$. The total energy lost to conduction over time $\\tau$ is:\n    $$E_{cond} = Q_{cond} \\tau = \\left(\\frac{4 k r_b^2 \\Delta T}{h}\\right) \\left(\\frac{2 r_b}{v}\\right) = \\frac{8 k r_b^3 \\Delta T}{h v}$$\n\nSubstituting these three terms into the energy balance equation:\n$$\\frac{2 A P r_b}{v} = 4 \\rho r_b^2 h H_f + \\frac{8 k r_b^3 \\Delta T}{h v}$$\nTo simplify, we can divide the entire equation by $2 r_b / v$:\n$$A P = (4 \\rho r_b^2 h H_f) \\frac{v}{2 r_b} + \\frac{8 k r_b^3 \\Delta T}{h v} \\frac{v}{2 r_b}$$\n$$A P = 2 \\rho v r_b h H_f + \\frac{4 k r_b^2 \\Delta T}{h}$$\nThis expresses a power balance in the steady-state moving frame. To solve for $h$, we multiply by $h$:\n$$A P h = 2 \\rho v r_b H_f h^2 + 4 k r_b^2 \\Delta T$$\nRearranging into a standard quadratic form $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$ for $x=h$:\n$$(2 \\rho v r_b H_f) h^2 - (A P) h + (4 k r_b^2 \\Delta T) = 0$$\nUsing the quadratic formula, $h = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$:\n$$h = \\frac{A P \\pm \\sqrt{(-A P)^2 - 4(2 \\rho v r_b H_f)(4 k r_b^2 \\Delta T)}}{2(2 \\rho v r_b H_f)}$$\n$$h = \\frac{A P \\pm \\sqrt{(A P)^2 - 32 \\rho v k r_b^3 H_f \\Delta T}}{4 \\rho v r_b H_f}$$\nTo select the physically correct root, we consider the limit of high power $P$, where melting dominates over conduction. In this limit, the term under the square root approaches $(A P)^2$. The solution with the minus sign would yield $h \\to 0$, which is unphysical. The solution with the plus sign yields a finite, positive depth. Therefore, we choose the plus sign.\n$$h(A) = \\frac{A P + \\sqrt{(A P)^2 - 32 \\rho v k r_b^3 H_f \\Delta T}}{4 \\rho v r_b H_f}$$\n\n### Calculation of Sensitivity\nWe need to compute the sensitivity $\\frac{\\partial h}{\\partial A}$. For clarity, let $C_1 = P$, $C_2 = 32 \\rho v k r_b^3 H_f \\Delta T$, and $C_3 = 4 \\rho v r_b H_f$.\nThe expression for $h$ becomes $h(A) = \\frac{C_1 A + \\sqrt{(C_1 A)^2 - C_2}}{C_3}$.\nDifferentiating with respect to $A$:\n$$\\frac{\\partial h}{\\partial A} = \\frac{1}{C_3} \\left[ \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial A}(C_1 A) + \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial A}\\sqrt{(C_1 A)^2 - C_2} \\right]$$\n$$\\frac{\\partial h}{\\partial A} = \\frac{1}{C_3} \\left[ C_1 + \\frac{1}{2\\sqrt{(C_1 A)^2 - C_2}} \\cdot (2 C_1^2 A) \\right]$$\n$$\\frac{\\partial h}{\\partial A} = \\frac{C_1}{C_3} \\left[ 1 + \\frac{C_1 A}{\\sqrt{(C_1 A)^2 - C_2}} \\right]$$\nSubstituting back the full expressions for the constants:\n$$\\frac{\\partial h}{\\partial A} = \\frac{P}{4 \\rho v r_b H_f} \\left[ 1 + \\frac{A P}{\\sqrt{(A P)^2 - 32 \\rho v k r_b^3 H_f \\Delta T}} \\right]$$\n\n### Numerical Evaluation\nFirst, we compute the defined parameters $\\Delta T$ and $H_f$:\n-   $\\Delta T = T_m - T_0 = 1700 - 300 = 1400\\,\\mathrm{K}$\n-   $H_f = c_p \\Delta T + L = (500\\,\\mathrm{J/(kg\\cdot K)})(1400\\,\\mathrm{K}) + 2.7 \\times 10^5\\,\\mathrm{J/kg} = 7 \\times 10^5 + 2.7 \\times 10^5 = 9.7 \\times 10^5\\,\\mathrm{J/kg}$\n\nNow we evaluate the sensitivity at the baseline parameters, with $A = A_0 = 0.35$.\n-   Absorbed power term: $A_0 P = 0.35 \\times 200\\,\\mathrm{W} = 70\\,\\mathrm{W}$\n-   The term subtracted under the square root: $X = 32 \\rho v k r_b^3 H_f \\Delta T$\n    $X = 32 \\cdot (8000) \\cdot (1.0) \\cdot (25) \\cdot (5 \\times 10^{-5})^3 \\cdot (9.7 \\times 10^5) \\cdot (1400) \\approx 1086.4\\,\\mathrm{W^2}$\n-   The term under the square root: $(A_0 P)^2 - X = (70)^2 - 1086.4 = 4900 - 1086.4 = 3813.6\\,\\mathrm{W^2}$\n-   The square root: $\\sqrt{3813.6} \\approx 61.754\\,\\mathrm{W}$\n-   The pre-factor in the derivative expression: $C_{pre} = \\frac{P}{4 \\rho v r_b H_f}$\n    $C_{pre} = \\frac{200}{4 \\cdot (8000) \\cdot (1.0) \\cdot (5 \\times 10^{-5}) \\cdot (9.7 \\times 10^5)} = \\frac{200}{1.552 \\times 10^6} \\approx 1.28866 \\times 10^{-4}\\,\\mathrm{m}$\n-   The term in brackets:\n    $1 + \\frac{A_0 P}{\\sqrt{(A_0 P)^2 - X}} = 1 + \\frac{70}{61.754} \\approx 1 + 1.13353 = 2.13353$\n\nFinally, we compute the sensitivity:\n$$\\left. \\frac{\\partial h}{\\partial A} \\right|_{A_0} = C_{pre} \\times 2.13353 = (1.28866 \\times 10^{-4}\\,\\mathrm{m}) \\times 2.13353 \\approx 2.7491 \\times 10^{-4}\\,\\mathrm{m}$$\nThe problem asks for the answer in micrometers ($\\mu\\mathrm{m}$).\n$$2.7491 \\times 10^{-4}\\,\\mathrm{m} = 274.91\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}$$\nRounding to three significant figures, we get $275$.\nThe units are $\\mu\\mathrm{m}$ per unit change in absorptivity $A$, as requested.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{275}$$", "id": "2901239"}, {"introduction": "As a newly solidified layer cools, it is constrained by the cooler, rigid material beneath it, leading to the buildup of thermal stresses.

This leads to an equation for the curvature $\\kappa$:\n$$\n\\kappa \\left( \\frac{t^3}{12} \\right) - \\int_{-t/2}^{t/2} \\varepsilon^{\\ast}(z) z dz = 0 \\quad \\implies \\quad \\kappa = \\frac{12}{t^3} \\int_{-t/2}^{t/2} \\varepsilon^{\\ast}(z) z dz\n$$\nThis expression demonstrates that the curvature is determined by the first moment of the eigenstrain distribution, and it is independent of the material's elastic properties ($E$ and $\\nu$).\n\nThe eigenstrain is given as a piecewise-constant function. For a stack of $N$ layers, each of thickness $a$, the total thickness is $t=Na$. The coordinate $z$ of the mid-plane of the $k$-th layer (indexed $k=1$ for bottom to $k=N$ for top) is given by:\n$$\nz_k = -\\frac{t}{2} + \\left(k - \\frac{1}{2}\\right)a\n$$\nSubstituting $t=Na$:\n$$\nz_k = -\\frac{Na}{2} + \\left(k - \\frac{1}{2}\\right)a = a \\left( k - \\frac{1}{2} - \\frac{N}{2} \\right) = a \\left( k - \\frac{N+1}{2} \\right)\n$$\nThe integral for the eigenstrain moment can be computed as a sum over the layers:\n$$\n\\int_{-t/2}^{t/2} \\varepsilon^{\\ast}(z) z dz = \\sum_{k=1}^{N} \\int_{\\text{layer } k} \\varepsilon_k z dz = \\sum_{k=1}^{N} \\varepsilon_k \\int_{z_k-a/2}^{z_k+a/2} z dz\n$$\nThe integral of $z$ over the $k$-th layer is:\n$$\n\\int_{z_k-a/2}^{z_k+a/2} z dz = \\left[\\frac{z^2}{2}\\right]_{z_k-a/2}^{z_k+a/2} = \\frac{1}{2}((z_k+\\frac{a}{2})^2 - (z_k-\\frac{a}{2})^2) = \\frac{1}{2}(2z_k a) = a z_k\n$$\nTherefore, the eigenstrain moment is:\n$$\n\\int_{-t/2}^{t/2} \\varepsilon^{\\ast}(z) z dz = \\sum_{k=1}^{N} \\varepsilon_k (a z_k) = a \\sum_{k=1}^{N} \\varepsilon_k \\left[ a \\left( k - \\frac{N+1}{2} \\right) \\right] = a^2 \\sum_{k=1}^{N} \\varepsilon_k \\left( k - \\frac{N+1}{2} \\right)\n$$\nSubstituting this into the expression for $\\kappa$ and using $t=Na$:\n$$\n\\kappa = \\frac{12}{(Na)^3} \\left[ a^2 \\sum_{k=1}^{N} \\varepsilon_k \\left( k - \\frac{N+1}{2} \\right) \\right] = \\frac{12}{N^3 a} \\sum_{k=1}^{N} \\varepsilon_k \\left( k - \\frac{N+1}{2} \\right)\n$$\nThis is the required symbolic expression for the curvature.\n\nNow, we compute the numerical value using the provided data:\n- $N=5$\n- $a=2.0 \\times 10^{-4}\\ \\mathrm{m}$\n- $\\varepsilon_0=1.2 \\times 10^{-3}$\n- $r=0.8$\n\nThe eigenstrain in layer $k$ is $\\varepsilon_k = \\varepsilon_0 r^{N-k} = (1.2 \\times 10^{-3}) (0.8)^{5-k}$.\n- For $k=1$: $\\varepsilon_1 = (1.2 \\times 10^{-3}) (0.8)^4 = 1.2 \\times 10^{-3} \\times 0.4096 = 4.9152 \\times 10^{-4}$\n- For $k=2$: $\\varepsilon_2 = (1.2 \\times 10^{-3}) (0.8)^3 = 1.2 \\times 10^{-3} \\times 0.512 = 6.144 \\times 10^{-4}$\n- For $k=3$: $\\varepsilon_3 = (1.2 \\times 10^{-3}) (0.8)^2 = 1.2 \\times 10^{-3} \\times 0.64 = 7.68 \\times 10^{-4}$\n- For $k=4$: $\\varepsilon_4 = (1.2 \\times 10^{-3}) (0.8)^1 = 1.2 \\times 10^{-3} \\times 0.8 = 9.6 \\times 10^{-4}$\n- For $k=5$: $\\varepsilon_5 = (1.2 \\times 10^{-3}) (0.8)^0 = 1.2 \\times 10^{-3} = 12.0 \\times 10^{-4}$\n\nThe weighting factor is $(k - \\frac{N+1}{2}) = (k - \\frac{5+1}{2}) = k-3$.\nWe compute the sum $S = \\sum_{k=1}^{5} \\varepsilon_k (k-3)$:\n$$\nS = \\varepsilon_1(-2) + \\varepsilon_2(-1) + \\varepsilon_3(0) + \\varepsilon_4(1) + \\varepsilon_5(2)\n$$\n$$\nS = (4.9152 \\times 10^{-4})(-2) + (6.144 \\times 10^{-4})(-1) + (0) + (9.6 \\times 10^{-4})(1) + (12.0 \\times 10^{-4})(2)\n$$\n$$\nS = 10^{-4} \\left[ -9.8304 - 6.144 + 9.6 + 24.0 \\right]\n$$\n$$\nS = 10^{-4} \\left[ 17.6256 \\right] = 1.76256 \\times 10^{-3}\n$$\nNow substitute this sum into the formula for $\\kappa$:\n$$\n\\kappa = \\frac{12}{N^3 a} S = \\frac{12}{5^3 \\times (2.0 \\times 10^{-4}\\ \\mathrm{m})} \\times (1.76256 \\times 10^{-3})\n$$\n$$\n\\kappa = \\frac{12}{125 \\times 2.0 \\times 10^{-4}\\ \\mathrm{m}} \\times (1.76256 \\times 10^{-3})\n$$\n$$\n\\kappa = \\frac{12}{250 \\times 10^{-4}\\ \\mathrm{m}} \\times (1.76256 \\times 10^{-3}) = \\frac{12}{0.025\\ \\mathrm{m}} \\times (1.76256 \\times 10^{-3})\n$$\n$$\n\\kappa = 480\\ \\mathrm{m}^{-1} \\times (1.76256 \\times 10^{-3}) = 0.8460288\\ \\mathrm{m}^{-1}\n$$\nRounding to four significant figures, the final result is $0.8460\\ \\mathrm{m}^{-1}$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{0.8460}\n$$", "id": "2901236"}]}
