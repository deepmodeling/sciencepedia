The normal surface approach is the sum of the individual half-space surface displacements produced by the same axisymmetric pressure distribution due to linearity and superposition.\n\nStarting from the fundamental base of linear elasticity (Hooke’s law) and the classical Boussinesq solution for the normal displacement of an isotropic elastic half-space due to normal loading, derive the material combination that defines the Hertzian effective (or reduced) modulus $E^*$ for two bodies in contact so that the normal displacement field in the contact region depends on the materials only through $E^*$.

It is a well-posed problem in classical linear elastic contact mechanics, free of scientific or logical flaws. The necessary data is provided, and the objectives are clear. We shall proceed with the derivation and subsequent calculations.\n\nThe problem requires the derivation of the effective modulus, $E^*$, for two elastic bodies in contact. The starting point is the Boussinesq solution for the normal displacement of an elastic half-space subjected to a surface pressure distribution.\n\nLet us consider an elastic half-space with Young's modulus $E$ and Poisson's ratio $\\nu$. When subjected to a pressure distribution $p(\\xi, \\eta)$ over a contact area $\\Omega$ on its surface ($z=0$), the normal displacement $u_z$ at a point $(x, y)$ on the surface is given by the integral of the point load solution:\n$$ u_z(x,y) = \\frac{1-\\nu^2}{\\pi E} \\iint_{\\Omega} \\frac{p(\\xi, \\eta)}{\\sqrt{(x-\\xi)^2 + (y-\\eta)^2}} d\\xi d\\eta $$\nThis result is a direct consequence of the linear theory of elasticity.\n\nThe problem states that two bodies, designated body $1$ and body $2$, are in contact. Their material properties are $(E_1, \\nu_1)$ and $(E_2, \\nu_2)$, respectively. According to Newton's third law, the pressure distribution $p(\\xi, \\eta)$ exerted by body $1$ on body $2$ is identical in magnitude to the pressure exerted by body $2$ on body $1$. Within the Hertzian framework, the total normal approach of the surfaces is the sum of the individual surface displacements, $u_{z1}$ and $u_{z2}$.\n\nThe displacement of the surface of body $1$, $u_{z1}$, is:\n$$ u_{z1}(x,y) = \\frac{1-\\nu_1^2}{\\pi E_1} \\iint_{\\Omega} \\frac{p(\\xi, \\eta)}{\\sqrt{(x-\\xi)^2 + (y-\\eta)^2}} d\\xi d\\eta $$\nAnd the displacement of the surface of body $2$, $u_{z2}$, is:\n$$ u_{z2}(x,y) = \\frac{1-\\nu_2^2}{\\pi E_2} \\iint_{\\Omega} \\frac{p(\\xi, \\eta)}{\\sqrt{(x-\\xi)^2 + (y-\\eta)^2}} d\\xi d\\eta $$\nThe total normal displacement, $u_z(x,y) = u_{z1}(x,y) + u_{z2}(x,y)$, is therefore:\n$$ u_z(x,y) = \\left( \\frac{1-\\nu_1^2}{\\pi E_1} + \\frac{1-\\nu_2^2}{\\pi E_2} \\right) \\iint_{\\Omega} \\frac{p(\\xi, \\eta)}{\\sqrt{(x-\\xi)^2 + (y-\\eta)^2}} d\\xi d\\eta $$\nWe can factor out the common integral term and combine the material properties:\n$$ u_z(x,y) = \\frac{1}{\\pi} \\left( \\frac{1-\\nu_1^2}{E_1} + \\frac{1-\\nu_2^2}{E_2} \\right) \\iint_{\\Omega} \\frac{p(\\xi, \\eta)}{\\sqrt{(x-\\xi)^2 + (y-\\eta)^2}} d\\xi d\\eta $$\nThe problem requires us to define an effective modulus $E^*$ such that the displacement field depends on the material properties solely through this a single parameter. Comparing the above expression with the form for a single body, we can see that the entire material dependence is contained within the parenthesis. The standard definition of the Hertzian effective modulus $E^*$ is chosen to consolidate these terms:\n$$ \\frac{1}{E^*} = \\frac{1-\\nu_1^2}{E_1} + \\frac{1-\\nu_2^2}{E_2} $$\nWith this definition, the total displacement becomes:\n$$ u_z(x,y) = \\frac{1}{\\pi E^*} \\iint_{\\Omega} \\frac{p(\\xi, \\eta)}{\\sqrt{(x-\\xi)^2 + (y-\\eta)^2}} d\\xi d\\eta $$\nThis achieves the required formulation. The two-body contact problem is thus mapped onto an equivalent problem of a rigid body indenting an elastic half-space with modulus $E^*$ and an effective Poisson's ratio of $0$.\n\nNext, we evaluate $E^*$ for the given material properties: $E_1=210\\,\\mathrm{GPa}$, $\\nu_1=0.3$, $E_2=70\\,\\mathrm{GPa}$, and $\\nu_2=0.2$.\nSubstituting these values into the derived expression for $1/E^*$:\n$$ \\frac{1}{E^*} = \\frac{1 - (0.3)^2}{210\\,\\mathrm{GPa}} + \\frac{1 - (0.2)^2}{70\\,\\mathrm{GPa}} $$\n$$ \\frac{1}{E^*} = \\frac{1 - 0.09}{210\\,\\mathrm{GPa}} + \\frac{1 - 0.04}{70\\,\\mathrm{GPa}} $$\n$$ \\frac{1}{E^*} = \\frac{0.91}{210\\,\\mathrm{GPa}} + \\frac{0.96}{70\\,\\mathrm{GPa}} $$\nTo combine the terms, we find a common denominator:\n$$ \\frac{1}{E^*} = \\frac{0.91}{210\\,\\mathrm{GPa}} + \\frac{3 \\times 0.96}{3 \\times 70\\,\\mathrm{GPa}} = \\frac{0.91 + 2.88}{210\\,\\mathrm{GPa}} = \\frac{3.79}{210\\,\\mathrm{GPa}} $$\nTherefore, the effective modulus $E^*$ is:\n$$ E^* = \\frac{210}{3.79}\\,\\mathrm{GPa} \\approx 55.40897\\,\\mathrm{GPa} $$\nRounding to four significant figures as required, we obtain $E^* = 55.41\\,\\mathrm{GPa}$.\n\nFinally, we analyze the behavior of $E^*$ as $\\nu_1 \\to 0.5$ and $\\nu_2 \\to 0.5$. A Poisson's ratio of $\\nu=0.5$ corresponds to the limit of incompressibility for an isotropic elastic material.\nThe expression for $E^*$ is $E^* = \\left( \\frac{1-\\nu_1^2}{E_1} + \\frac{1-\\nu_2^2}{E_2} \\right)^{-1}$.\nAs $\\nu_i$ increases in the range $[0, 0.5]$, the term $(1-\\nu_i^2)$ decreases. Consequently, the sum $\\frac{1-\\nu_1^2}{E_1} + \\frac{1-\\nu_2^2}{E_2}$, which is equal to $1/E^*$, also decreases. Since $1/E^*$ is a decreasing function of $\\nu_1$ and $\\nu_2$, its reciprocal, $E^*$, must be an increasing function. Qualitatively, as the materials become more incompressible, an increasing normal force is required to achieve the same indentation depth, meaning the contact becomes effectively stiffer, which is reflected by a higher value of $E^*$.\n\nQuantitatively, we evaluate $E^*$ at the limit where $\\nu_1 = 0.5$ and $\\nu_2 = 0.5$:\n$$ \\lim_{\\nu_1, \\nu_2 \\to 0.5} \\frac{1}{E^*} = \\frac{1 - (0.5)^2}{210\\,\\mathrm{GPa}} + \\frac{1 - (0.5)^2}{70\\,\\mathrm{GPa}} $$\n$$ \\frac{1}{E^*_{limit}} = \\frac{0.75}{210\\,\\mathrm{GPa}} + \\frac{0.75}{70\\,\\mathrm{GPa}} = 0.75 \\left( \\frac{1}{210} + \\frac{3}{210} \\right)\\,\\mathrm{GPa}^{-1} $$\n$$ \\frac{1}{E^*_{limit}} = 0.75 \\left( \\frac{4}{210} \\right)\\,\\mathrm{GPa}^{-1} = \\frac{3}{4} \\frac{4}{210}\\,\\mathrm{GPa}^{-1} = \\frac{3}{210}\\,\\mathrm{GPa}^{-1} = \\frac{1}{70}\\,\\mathrm{GPa}^{-1} $$\nThus, the limiting value of the effective modulus is $E^*_{limit} = 70\\,\\mathrm{GPa}$.\nComparing this to the value calculated for the given parameters ($E^* \\approx 55.41\\,\\mathrm{GPa}$), we see a quantitative increase of $E^*_{limit} - E^* \\approx 70 - 55.41 = 14.59\\,\\mathrm{GPa}$. This represents a substantial increase in contact stiffness of approximately $26.3\\%$. The effective modulus $E^*$ is bounded by the cases of $\\nu_1=\\nu_2=0$ ($E^*=52.5\\,\\mathrm{GPa}$) and $\\nu_1=\\nu_2=0.5$ ($E^*=70\\,\\mathrm{GPa}$) for the given Young's moduli.\n\nThe requested final answer is the numerical value for $E^*$ rounded to four significant figures for the given parameters.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{55.41}\n$$", "id": "2891983"}, {"introduction": "The predictive power of Hertzian theory is confined to the realm of linear elasticity.

The problem directs us to consider the stress state along the axis of symmetry (the $z$-axis, with $r=0$), where $z$ is the depth into the half-space measured from the surface. On this axis, the shear stress components are zero ($\\tau_{rz} = \\tau_{z\\theta} = \\tau_{r\\theta} = 0$), so the radial ($\\sigma_{rr}$), tangential ($\\sigma_{\\theta\\theta}$), and axial ($\\sigma_{zz}$) stresses are the principal stresses. Due to axial symmetry, $\\sigma_{rr} = \\sigma_{\\theta\\theta}$.\n\nThe principal stresses on the axis of symmetry ($r=0$) are given by the well-established formulas derived from potential theory:\n$$ \\sigma_{zz} = -p_0 \\left(1 + \\frac{z^2}{a^2}\\right)^{-1} $$\n$$ \\sigma_{rr} = \\sigma_{\\theta\\theta} = -p_0 \\left[ (1+\\nu)\\left(1 - \\frac{z}{a}\\arctan\\left(\\frac{a}{z}\\right)\\right) - \\frac{1}{2}\\left(1 + \\frac{z^2}{a^2}\\right)^{-1} \\right] $$\nHere, both stresses are compressive (negative).\n\nThe von Mises equivalent stress, $\\sigma_{\\mathrm{eq}}$, is defined in terms of the principal stresses $\\sigma_1, \\sigma_2, \\sigma_3$ as:\n$$ \\sigma_{\\mathrm{eq}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{2} [(\\sigma_1 - \\sigma_2)^2 + (\\sigma_2 - \\sigma_3)^2 + (\\sigma_3 - \\sigma_1)^2]} $$\nAlong the axis of symmetry, we set $\\sigma_1 = \\sigma_2 = \\sigma_{rr}$ and $\\sigma_3 = \\sigma_{zz}$. The expression for the von Mises stress simplifies significantly as requested:\n$$ \\sigma_{\\mathrm{eq}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{2} [(\\sigma_{rr} - \\sigma_{rr})^2 + (\\sigma_{rr} - \\sigma_{zz})^2 + (\\sigma_{zz} - \\sigma_{rr})^2]} = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{2} [0 + 2(\\sigma_{rr} - \\sigma_{zz})^2]} = \\sqrt{(\\sigma_{rr} - \\sigma_{zz})^2} = |\\sigma_{rr} - \\sigma_{zz}| $$\nYielding will initiate at the location where $\\sigma_{\\mathrm{eq}}$ first reaches the material's yield strength $\\sigma_y$. We must find the maximum value of $\\sigma_{\\mathrm{eq}}$ as a function of depth $z$.\n\nLet us compute the difference $\\sigma_{rr} - \\sigma_{zz}$:\n$$ \\sigma_{rr} - \\sigma_{zz} = -p_0 \\left[ (1+\\nu)\\left(1 - \\frac{z}{a}\\arctan\\left(\\frac{a}{z}\\right)\\right) - \\frac{1}{2}\\left(1 + \\frac{z^2}{a^2}\\right)^{-1} \\right] - \\left[ -p_0 \\left(1 + \\frac{z^2}{a^2}\\right)^{-1} \\right] $$\n$$ \\sigma_{rr} - \\sigma_{zz} = p_0 \\left[ -(1+\\nu)\\left(1 - \\frac{z}{a}\\arctan\\left(\\frac{a}{z}\\right)\\right) + \\frac{1}{2}\\left(1 + \\frac{z^2}{a^2}\\right)^{-1} + \\left(1 + \\frac{z^2}{a^2}\\right)^{-1} \\right] $$\nLet $\\zeta = z/a$ be the normalized depth.\n$$ \\frac{\\sigma_{rr} - \\sigma_{zz}}{p_0} = -(1+\\nu) + (1+\\nu)\\zeta\\arctan\\left(\\frac{1}{\\zeta}\\right) + \\frac{3}{2(1+\\zeta^2)} $$\nThis difference is positive for $\\zeta0$ and $\\nu  0.5$.

The solution depends on Poisson's ratio $\\nu$. As the problem asks for a single numerical answer, we assume a standard value for metallic materials, $\\nu=0.3$.\nFor $\\nu=0.3$, the equation becomes:\n$$ 1.3\\left[\\arctan\\left(\\frac{1}{\\zeta^*}\\right) - \\frac{\\zeta^*}{1+(\\zeta^*)^2}\\right] = \\frac{3\\zeta^*}{(1+(\\zeta^*)^2)^2} $$\nNumerical solution of this equation yields $\\zeta^* \\approx 0.4809$. This is the normalized depth $z/a$ at which yielding commences on the axis of symmetry. It is important to note that for $\\nu=0.3$, this is also the location of the global maximum of the von Mises stress in the entire half-space.\n\nNow, we evaluate $H(\\zeta^*)$ at $\\zeta^* = 0.4809$:\n$$ H(0.4809) = -1.3 + 1.3(0.4809)\\arctan\\left(\\frac{1}{0.4809}\\right) + \\frac{3}{2(1+(0.4809)^2)} $$\n$$ H(0.4809) = -1.3 + 1.3(0.4809)(1.1223) + \\frac{1.5}{1.23126} \\approx -1.3 + 0.7016 + 1.2183 \\approx 0.6199 $$\nSo, the maximum von Mises stress is $(\\sigma_{\\mathrm{eq}})_{\\max} \\approx 0.6199 p_0$.\n\nYielding begins when this maximum stress equals the yield strength $\\sigma_y$. Let $p_{0,y}$ be the value of $p_0$ at the onset of yielding.\n$$ (\\sigma_{\\mathrm{eq}})_{\\max} = 0.6199 p_{0,y} = \\sigma_y $$\nSolving for the required ratio:\n$$ \\frac{p_{0,y}}{\\sigma_y} = \\frac{1}{0.6199} \\approx 1.6131 $$\n\n**Comparison with Tresca Criterion**\n\nThe Tresca (or maximum shear stress) criterion states that yielding occurs when the maximum shear stress $\\tau_{\\max}$ reaches a critical value. For a material with uniaxial tensile yield strength $\\sigma_y$, this critical value is $\\sigma_y/2$.\n$$ \\tau_{\\max} = \\frac{\\sigma_y}{2} $$\nThe maximum shear stress is given by $\\tau_{\\max} = \\frac{\\sigma_1 - \\sigma_3}{2}$, where $\\sigma_1$ and $\\sigma_3$ are the maximum and minimum principal stresses, respectively.\nOn the axis of symmetry, the principal stresses are $\\sigma_1 = \\sigma_2 = \\sigma_{rr}$ and $\\sigma_3 = \\sigma_{zz}$ (since $|\\sigma_{zz}|  |\\sigma_{rr}|$, $\\sigma_{zz}$ is more negative). The maximum shear stress is:\n$$ \\tau_{\\max} = \\frac{\\sigma_{rr} - \\sigma_{zz}}{2} $$\nThe Tresca yield condition on the axis of symmetry is therefore:\n$$ \\frac{\\sigma_{rr} - \\sigma_{zz}}{2} = \\frac{\\sigma_y}{2} \\implies \\sigma_{rr} - \\sigma_{zz} = \\sigma_y $$\nThis is identical to the von Mises yield condition, $\\sigma_{\\mathrm{eq}} = |\\sigma_{rr} - \\sigma_{zz}| = \\sigma_y$, which we derived for the axis of symmetry.\n\nA criterion is more conservative if it predicts yielding at a lower applied load. To compare the two criteria, we must find where each criterion's governing stress measure is maximized.\n- For the von Mises criterion, with $\\nu=0.3$, the maximum of $\\sigma_{\\mathrm{eq}}/p_0$ occurs on the axis of symmetry ($r=0$) at $z \\approx 0.48a$.\n- For the Tresca criterion, with $\\nu=0.3$, the maximum of $\\tau_{\\max}/p_0$ also occurs on the axis of symmetry, at almost the same depth.\n\nSince both criteria have their critical locations on the axis of symmetry, and on this axis the mathematical forms of their yield conditions become identical ($\\sigma_{rr} - \\sigma_{zz} = \\sigma_y$), they will predict yielding at the same pressure $p_{0,y}$.\nTherefore, in this specific case of Hertzian contact on a material with $\\nu = 0.3$, neither the von Mises nor the Tresca criterion is more conservative than the other; their predictions are identical.\n\nThe final answer for the ratio $p_{0,y}/\\sigma_y$ based on the von Mises criterion, rounded to $4$ significant figures, is $1.613$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{1.613}$$", "id": "2891953"}, {"introduction": "While analytical solutions like Hertz's are invaluable, they are limited to idealized geometries.

No additional text should be printed.", "solution": "The problem requires the formulation and implementation of a discrete axisymmetric Boundary Element Method (BEM) to solve for the pressure distribution in an elastic contact problem. The solution is then compared against the established analytical Hertzian theory. The following steps detail the derivation of the numerical model and the procedure for its solution and validation.\n\nFirst, the contact domain, a circular area of radius $a$, is discretized into $N$ concentric annular rings. The boundaries of these rings are defined by radii $\\{r_{j+1/2}\\}_{j=0}^{N}$. Assuming uniform ring widths, the radius of the $j$-th boundary is given by $r_{j+1/2} = j \\cdot \\frac{a}{N}$ for $j=0, 1, \\dots, N$. The $j$-th ring, for $j=1, \\dots, N$, is the region between radii $r_{j-1/2}$ and $r_{j+1/2}$. Over each ring $j$, the unknown contact pressure $p(\\rho)$ is assumed to be a constant, $p_j$.\n\nThe impenetrability condition, $u_{z}(r) = \\delta - \\phi(r)$, must be enforced at a set of collocation points. For a piecewise-constant BEM, it is convenient to choose the collocation point $r_i$ for the $i$-th ring as its geometric midpoint:\n$$\nr_{i} = \\frac{r_{i-1/2} + r_{i+1/2}}{2} = (i - 0.5) \\frac{a}{N}, \\quad \\text{for } i=1, \\dots, N.\n$$\nThe surface displacement $u_z(r_i)$ at a collocation point $r_i$ is the superposition of displacements caused by the pressure on all rings $j=1, \\dots, N$. The displacement caused by a pressure distribution $p(\\rho)$ is given by the integral:\n$$\nu_{z}(r_i) = \\frac{1}{\\pi E^*} \\int_{0}^{a} \\int_{0}^{2\\pi} \\frac{p(\\rho)\\,\\rho}{\\sqrt{r_i^{2} + \\rho^{2} - 2 r_i \\rho \\cos\\theta}} \\, d\\theta \\, d\\rho.\n$$\nSubstituting the piecewise-constant pressure approximation $p(\\rho) = p_j$ for $\\rho \\in [r_{j-1/2}, r_{j+1/2}]$, the displacement becomes a sum:\n$$\nu_{z}(r_i) = \\sum_{j=1}^{N} p_j \\left( \\frac{1}{\\pi E^*} \\int_{r_{j-1/2}}^{r_{j+1/2}} \\rho \\left( \\int_{0}^{2\\pi} \\frac{d\\theta}{\\sqrt{r_i^{2} + \\rho^{2} - 2 r_i \\rho \\cos\\theta}} \\right) d\\rho \\right).\n$$\nThis is a linear system of equations $\\mathbf{A}\\mathbf{p} = \\mathbf{b}$, where $\\mathbf{p} = \\{p_j\\}_{j=1}^N$ is the vector of unknown ring pressures. The right-hand side vector $\\mathbf{b}$ has components $b_i$ corresponding to the known surface profile at the collocation points:\n$$\nb_i = u_z(r_i) = \\delta - \\phi(r_i).\n$$\nUsing the given indenter profile $\\phi(r) = r^2/(2R)$ and the indentation depth $\\delta = a^2/R$, which is consistent with Hertz theory for a spherical indenter, we have:\n$$\nb_i = \\frac{a^2}{R} - \\frac{r_i^2}{2R} = \\frac{1}{2R} (2a^2 - r_i^2).\n$$\nThe matrix entries $A_{ij}$, known as influence coefficients, represent the displacement at collocation point $r_i$ due to a unit pressure on ring $j$. Using the provided identity for the angular integral, which involves the complete elliptic integral of the first kind, $K(m)$, we can express $A_{ij}$ as a single radial integral:\n$$\nA_{ij} = \\frac{1}{\\pi E^*} \\int_{r_{j-1/2}}^{r_{j+1/2}} \\rho \\left( \\frac{4}{r_i + \\rho} K\\left(\\frac{4 r_i \\rho}{(r_i + \\rho)^{2}}\\right) \\right) d\\rho = \\frac{4}{\\pi E^*} \\int_{r_{j-1/2}}^{r_{j+1/2}} \\frac{\\rho}{r_i + \\rho} K\\left(\\frac{4 r_i \\rho}{(r_i + \\rho)^2}\\right) d\\rho.\n$$\nThis integral must be evaluated numerically. For off-diagonal elements ($i \\neq j$), the integrand is smooth over the integration domain $[r_{j-1/2}, r_{j+1/2}]$. However, for diagonal elements ($i=j$), the argument of the elliptic integral, $m = \\frac{4 r_i \\rho}{(r_i + \\rho)^2}$, approaches $1$ as $\\rho \\to r_i$. Since $K(m)$ has an integrable logarithmic singularity as $m \\to 1$, the point $\\rho=r_i$ is a singular point within the integration interval for $A_{ii}$. This must be handled by the numerical quadrature routine, for instance by specifying the location of the singularity.\n\nAfter assembling the $N \\times N$ matrix $\\mathbf{A}$ and the vector $\\mathbf{b}$, the linear system $\\mathbf{A}\\mathbf{p} = \\mathbf{b}$ is solved to find the discrete pressure vector $\\mathbf{p}$.\n\nTo assess the accuracy of this numerical solution, it is compared to the classical Hertz theory for a spherical indenter. The Hertzian pressure distribution is:\n$$\np_{\\mathrm{Hertz}}(r) = p_{0}\\sqrt{1 - \\frac{r^{2}}{a^{2}}}, \\quad \\text{with maximum pressure } p_{0} = \\frac{2 E^* a}{\\pi R}.\n$$\nThe total contact load under this distribution is:\n$$\nP_{\\mathrm{Hertz}} = \\frac{4}{3} \\frac{E^* a^{3}}{R}.\n$$\nThe following quantitative error metrics are computed:\n1.  The ring-area-weighted relative $\\ell^{2}$ error, $\\varepsilon_2$, compares the computed pressure distribution $\\{p_j\\}$ to the analytical values at the collocation points, $\\{p_{\\mathrm{Hertz}}(r_j)\\}$:\n$$\n\\varepsilon_{2} = \\frac{\\left[\\sum_{j=1}^{N} \\left(p_{j} - p_{\\mathrm{Hertz}}(r_{j})\\right)^{2} \\, w_{j}\\right]^{1/2}}{\\left[\\sum_{j=1}^{N} p_{\\mathrm{Hertz}}(r_{j})^{2} \\, w_{j}\\right]^{1/2}},\n$$\nwhere the weight $w_j$ is the integrated radial coordinate over the ring area, $w_{j} = (r_{j+1/2}^{2} - r_{j-1/2}^{2})/2$.\n\n2.  The relative load error, $\\varepsilon_P$, compares the numerically integrated total load $P_{\\mathrm{num}}$ with the analytical Hertzian load $P_{\\mathrm{Hertz}}$:\n$$\nP_{\\mathrm{num}} = 2\\pi \\sum_{j=1}^{N} p_{j} \\, w_{j}, \\quad \\varepsilon_{P} = \\left|\\frac{P_{\\mathrm{num}} - P_{\\mathrm{Hertz}}}{P_{\\mathrm{Hertz}}}\\right|.\n$$\n\n3.  The relative error in the maximum pressure, $\\varepsilon_0$, compares the pressure in the central ring $p_1$ with the analytical maximum pressure $p_0$:\n$$\n\\varepsilon_{0} = \\left|\\frac{p_{1} - p_{0}}{p_{0}}\\right|.\n$$\nThis procedure is applied to each of the $3$ specified test cases, and the resulting error metrics are reported.", "answer": "[[0.007675,0.000078,0.005118],[0.012134,0.000196,0.008035],[0.007675,0.000078,0.005118]]", "id": "2891964"}]}
